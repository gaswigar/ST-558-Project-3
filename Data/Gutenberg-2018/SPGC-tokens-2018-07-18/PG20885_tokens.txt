introduction
i
was
born
i
have
lived
and
i
have
been
made
over
is
it
not
time
to
write
my
life
story
i
am
just
as
much
out
of
the
way
as
if
i
were
dead
for
i
am
absolutely
other
than
the
person
whose
story
i
have
to
tell
physical
continuity
with
my
earlier
self
is
no
disadvantage
i
could
speak
in
the
third
person
and
not
feel
that
i
was
masquerading
i
can
analyze
my
subject
i
can
reveal
everything
for
and
not
is
my
real
heroine
my
life
i
have
still
to
live
her
life
ended
when
mine
began
a
generation
is
sometimes
a
more
satisfactory
unit
for
the
study
of
humanity
than
a
lifetime
and
spiritual
generations
are
as
easy
to
demark
as
physical
ones
now
i
am
the
spiritual
offspring
of
the
marriage
within
my
conscious
experience
of
the
past
and
the
present
my
second
birth
was
no
less
a
birth
because
there
was
no
distinct
incarnation
surely
it
has
happened
before
that
one
body
served
more
than
one
spiritual
organization
nor
am
i
disowning
my
father
and
mother
of
the
flesh
for
they
were
also
partners
in
the
generation
of
my
second
self
copartners
with
my
entire
line
of
ancestors
they
gave
me
body
so
that
i
have
eyes
like
my
father
and
hair
like
my
mother
the
spirit
also
they
gave
me
so
that
i
reason
like
my
father
and
endure
like
my
mother
but
did
they
set
me
down
in
a
sheltered
garden
where
the
sun
should
warm
me
and
no
winter
should
hurt
while
they
fed
me
from
their
hands
no
they
early
let
me
run
in
the
fields
perhaps
because
i
would
not
be
held
and
eat
of
the
wild
fruits
and
drink
of
the
dew
did
they
teach
me
from
books
and
tell
me
what
to
believe
i
soon
chose
my
own
books
and
built
me
a
world
of
my
own
in
these
discriminations
emerged
a
new
being
something
that
had
not
been
before
and
when
i
discovered
my
own
friends
and
ran
home
with
them
to
convert
my
parents
to
a
belief
in
their
excellence
did
i
not
begin
to
make
my
father
and
mother
as
truly
as
they
had
ever
made
me
did
i
not
become
the
parent
and
they
the
children
in
those
relations
of
teacher
and
learner
and
so
i
can
say
that
there
has
been
more
than
one
birth
of
myself
and
i
can
regard
my
earlier
self
as
a
separate
being
and
make
it
a
subject
of
study
a
proper
autobiography
is
a
confession
a
true
man
finds
so
much
work
to
do
that
he
has
no
time
to
contemplate
his
yesterdays
for
and
are
here
with
their
impatient
tasks
the
world
is
so
busy
too
that
it
can
not
afford
to
study
any
man
unfinished
work
for
the
end
may
prove
it
a
failure
and
the
world
needs
masterpieces
still
there
are
circumstances
by
which
a
man
is
justified
in
pausing
in
the
middle
of
his
life
to
contemplate
the
years
already
passed
one
who
has
completed
early
in
life
a
distinct
task
may
stop
to
give
an
account
of
it
one
who
has
encountered
unusual
adventures
under
vanishing
conditions
may
pause
to
describe
them
before
passing
into
the
stable
world
and
perhaps
he
also
might
be
given
an
early
hearing
who
without
having
ventured
out
of
the
familiar
paths
without
having
achieved
any
signal
triumph
has
lived
his
simple
life
so
intensely
so
thoughtfully
as
to
have
discovered
in
his
own
experience
an
interpretation
of
the
universal
life
i
am
not
yet
thirty
counting
in
years
and
i
am
writing
my
life
history
under
which
of
the
above
categories
do
i
find
my
justification
i
have
not
accomplished
anything
i
have
not
discovered
anything
not
even
by
accident
as
columbus
discovered
america
my
life
has
been
unusual
but
by
no
means
unique
and
this
is
the
very
core
of
the
matter
it
is
because
i
understand
my
history
in
its
larger
outlines
to
be
typical
of
many
that
i
consider
it
worth
recording
my
life
is
a
concrete
illustration
of
a
multitude
of
statistical
facts
although
i
have
written
a
genuine
personal
memoir
i
believe
that
its
chief
interest
lies
in
the
fact
that
it
is
illustrative
of
scores
of
unwritten
lives
i
am
only
one
of
many
whose
fate
it
has
been
to
live
a
page
of
modern
history
we
are
the
strands
of
the
cable
that
binds
the
old
world
to
the
new
as
the
ships
that
brought
us
link
the
shores
of
europe
and
america
so
our
lives
span
the
bitter
sea
of
racial
differences
and
misunderstandings
before
we
came
the
new
world
knew
not
the
old
but
since
we
have
begun
to
come
the
young
world
has
taken
the
old
by
the
hand
and
the
two
are
learning
to
march
side
by
side
seeking
a
common
destiny
perhaps
i
have
taken
needless
trouble
to
furnish
an
excuse
for
my
autobiography
my
age
alone
my
true
age
would
be
reason
enough
for
my
writing
i
began
life
in
the
middle
ages
as
i
shall
prove
and
here
am
i
still
your
contemporary
in
the
twentieth
century
thrilling
with
your
latest
thought
had
i
no
better
excuse
for
writing
i
still
might
be
driven
to
it
by
my
private
needs
it
is
in
one
sense
a
matter
of
my
personal
salvation
i
was
at
a
most
impressionable
age
when
i
was
transplanted
to
the
new
soil
i
was
in
that
period
when
even
normal
children
undisturbed
in
their
customary
environment
begin
to
explore
their
own
hearts
and
endeavor
to
account
for
themselves
and
their
world
and
my
zest
for
seems
not
to
have
been
distracted
by
the
necessity
of
exploring
a
new
outer
universe
i
embarked
on
a
double
voyage
of
discovery
and
an
exciting
life
it
was
i
took
note
of
everything
i
could
no
more
keep
my
mind
from
the
shifting
changing
landscape
than
an
infant
can
keep
his
eyes
from
the
shining
candle
moved
across
his
field
of
vision
thus
everything
impressed
itself
on
my
memory
and
with
double
associations
for
i
was
constantly
referring
my
new
world
to
the
old
for
comparison
and
the
old
to
the
new
for
elucidation
i
became
a
student
and
philosopher
by
force
of
circumstances
had
i
been
brought
to
america
a
few
years
earlier
i
might
have
written
that
in
such
and
such
a
year
my
father
emigrated
just
as
i
would
state
what
he
did
for
a
living
as
a
matter
of
family
history
happening
when
it
did
the
emigration
became
of
the
most
vital
importance
to
me
personally
all
the
processes
of
uprooting
transportation
replanting
acclimatization
and
development
took
place
in
my
own
soul
i
felt
the
pang
the
fear
the
wonder
and
the
joy
of
it
i
can
never
forget
for
i
bear
the
scars
but
i
want
to
forget
sometimes
i
long
to
forget
i
think
i
have
thoroughly
assimilated
my
past
i
have
done
its
bidding
i
want
now
to
be
of
it
is
painful
to
be
consciously
of
two
worlds
the
wandering
jew
in
me
seeks
forgetfulness
i
am
not
afraid
to
live
on
and
on
if
only
i
do
not
have
to
remember
too
much
a
long
past
vividly
remembered
is
like
a
heavy
garment
that
clings
to
your
limbs
when
you
would
run
and
i
have
thought
of
a
charm
that
should
release
me
from
the
folds
of
my
clinging
past
i
take
the
hint
from
the
ancient
mariner
who
told
his
tale
in
order
to
be
rid
of
it
i
too
will
tell
my
tale
for
once
and
never
hark
back
any
more
i
will
write
a
bold
finis
at
the
end
and
shut
the
book
with
a
bang
the
promised
land
chapter
i
within
the
pale
when
i
was
a
little
girl
the
world
was
divided
into
two
parts
namely
polotzk
the
place
where
i
lived
and
a
strange
land
called
russia
all
the
little
girls
i
knew
lived
in
polotzk
with
their
fathers
and
mothers
and
friends
russia
was
the
place
where
father
went
on
business
it
was
so
far
off
and
so
many
bad
things
happened
there
that
one
mother
and
grandmother
and
aunts
cried
at
the
railroad
station
and
one
was
expected
to
be
sad
and
quiet
for
the
rest
of
the
day
when
the
father
departed
for
russia
after
a
while
there
came
to
my
knowledge
the
existence
of
another
division
a
region
intermediate
between
polotzk
and
russia
it
seemed
there
was
a
place
called
vitebsk
and
one
called
vilna
and
riga
and
some
others
from
those
places
came
photographs
of
uncles
and
cousins
one
had
never
seen
and
letters
and
sometimes
the
uncles
themselves
these
uncles
were
just
like
people
in
polotzk
the
people
in
russia
one
understood
were
very
different
in
answer
to
one
questions
the
visiting
uncles
said
all
sorts
of
silly
things
to
make
everybody
laugh
and
so
one
never
found
out
why
vitebsk
and
vilna
since
they
were
not
polotzk
were
not
as
sad
as
russia
mother
hardly
cried
at
all
when
the
uncles
went
away
one
time
when
i
was
about
eight
years
old
one
of
my
cousins
went
to
vitebsk
everybody
went
to
see
her
off
but
i
did
i
went
with
her
i
was
put
on
the
train
with
my
best
dress
tied
up
in
a
bandana
and
i
stayed
on
the
train
for
hours
and
hours
and
came
to
vitebsk
i
could
not
tell
as
we
rushed
along
where
the
end
of
polotzk
was
there
were
a
great
many
places
on
the
way
with
strange
names
but
it
was
very
plain
when
we
got
to
vitebsk
the
railroad
station
was
a
big
place
much
bigger
than
the
one
in
polotzk
several
trains
came
in
at
once
instead
of
only
one
there
was
an
immense
buffet
with
fruits
and
confections
and
a
place
where
books
were
sold
my
cousin
never
let
go
my
hand
on
account
of
the
crowd
then
we
rode
in
a
cab
for
ever
so
long
and
i
saw
the
most
beautiful
streets
and
shops
and
houses
much
bigger
and
finer
than
any
in
polotzk
we
remained
in
vitebsk
several
days
and
i
saw
many
wonderful
things
but
what
gave
me
my
one
great
surprise
was
something
that
was
new
at
all
it
was
the
river
the
river
dvina
now
the
dvina
is
in
polotzk
all
my
life
i
had
seen
the
dvina
how
then
could
the
dvina
be
in
vitebsk
my
cousin
and
i
had
come
on
the
train
but
everybody
knew
that
a
train
could
go
everywhere
even
to
russia
it
became
clear
to
me
that
the
dvina
went
on
and
on
like
a
railroad
track
whereas
i
had
always
supposed
that
it
stopped
where
polotzk
stopped
i
had
never
seen
the
end
of
polotzk
i
meant
to
when
i
was
bigger
but
how
could
there
be
an
end
to
polotzk
now
polotzk
was
everything
on
both
sides
of
the
dvina
as
all
my
life
i
had
known
and
the
dvina
it
now
turned
out
never
broke
off
at
all
it
was
very
curious
that
the
dvina
should
remain
the
same
while
polotzk
changed
into
vitebsk
the
mystery
of
this
transmutation
led
to
much
fruitful
thinking
the
boundary
between
polotzk
and
the
rest
of
the
world
was
not
as
i
had
supposed
a
physical
barrier
like
the
fence
which
divided
our
garden
from
the
street
the
world
went
like
this
now
polotzk
more
polotzk
more
polotzk
vitebsk
and
vitebsk
was
not
so
different
only
bigger
and
brighter
and
more
crowded
and
vitebsk
was
not
the
end
the
dvina
and
the
railroad
went
on
beyond
vitebsk
went
on
to
russia
then
was
russia
more
polotzk
was
here
also
no
dividing
fence
how
i
wanted
to
see
russia
but
very
few
people
went
there
when
people
went
to
russia
it
was
a
sign
of
trouble
either
they
could
not
make
a
living
at
home
or
they
were
drafted
for
the
army
or
they
had
a
lawsuit
no
nobody
went
to
russia
for
pleasure
why
in
russia
lived
the
czar
and
a
great
many
cruel
people
and
in
russia
were
the
dreadful
prisons
from
which
people
never
came
back
polotzk
and
vitebsk
were
now
bound
together
by
the
continuity
of
the
earth
but
between
them
and
russia
a
formidable
barrier
still
interposed
i
learned
as
i
grew
older
that
much
as
polotzk
disliked
to
go
to
russia
even
more
did
russia
object
to
letting
polotzk
come
people
from
polotzk
were
sometimes
turned
back
before
they
had
finished
their
business
and
often
they
were
cruelly
treated
on
the
way
it
seemed
there
were
certain
places
in
russia
petersburg
and
moscow
and
kiev
where
my
father
or
my
uncle
or
my
neighbor
must
never
come
at
all
no
matter
what
important
things
invited
them
the
police
would
seize
them
and
send
them
back
to
polotzk
like
wicked
criminals
although
they
had
never
done
any
wrong
it
was
strange
enough
that
my
relatives
should
be
treated
like
this
but
at
least
there
was
this
excuse
for
sending
them
back
to
polotzk
that
they
belonged
there
for
what
reason
were
people
driven
out
of
petersburg
and
moscow
who
had
their
homes
in
those
cities
and
had
no
other
place
to
go
to
ever
so
many
people
men
and
women
and
even
children
came
to
polotzk
where
they
had
no
friends
with
stories
of
cruel
treatment
in
russia
and
although
they
were
nobody
relatives
they
were
taken
in
and
helped
and
set
up
in
business
like
unfortunates
after
a
fire
it
was
very
strange
that
the
czar
and
the
police
should
want
all
russia
for
themselves
it
was
a
very
big
country
it
took
many
days
for
a
letter
to
reach
one
father
in
russia
why
might
not
everybody
be
there
who
wanted
to
i
do
not
know
when
i
became
old
enough
to
understand
the
truth
was
borne
in
on
me
a
dozen
times
a
day
from
the
time
i
began
to
distinguish
words
from
empty
noises
my
grandmother
told
me
about
it
when
she
put
me
to
bed
at
night
my
parents
told
me
about
it
when
they
gave
me
presents
on
holidays
my
playmates
told
me
when
they
drew
me
back
into
a
corner
of
the
gateway
to
let
a
policeman
pass
vanka
the
little
boy
told
me
all
about
it
when
he
ran
out
of
his
mother
laundry
on
purpose
to
throw
mud
after
me
when
i
happened
to
pass
i
heard
about
it
during
prayers
and
when
women
quarrelled
in
the
market
place
and
sometimes
waking
in
the
night
i
heard
my
parents
whisper
it
in
the
dark
there
was
no
time
in
my
life
when
i
did
not
hear
and
see
and
feel
the
truth
the
reason
why
polotzk
was
cut
off
from
the
rest
of
russia
it
was
the
first
lesson
a
little
girl
in
polotzk
had
to
learn
but
for
a
long
while
i
did
not
understand
then
there
came
a
time
when
i
knew
that
polotzk
and
vitebsk
and
vilna
and
some
other
places
were
grouped
together
as
the
pale
of
settlement
and
within
this
area
the
czar
commanded
me
to
stay
with
my
father
and
mother
and
friends
and
all
other
people
like
us
we
must
not
be
found
outside
the
pale
because
we
were
jews
so
there
was
a
fence
around
polotzk
after
all
the
world
was
divided
into
jews
and
gentiles
this
knowledge
came
so
gradually
that
it
could
not
shock
me
it
trickled
into
my
consciousness
drop
by
drop
by
the
time
i
fully
understood
that
i
was
a
prisoner
the
shackles
had
grown
familiar
to
my
flesh
the
first
time
vanka
threw
mud
at
me
i
ran
home
and
complained
to
my
mother
who
brushed
off
my
dress
and
said
quite
resignedly
how
can
i
help
you
my
poor
child
vanka
is
a
gentile
the
gentiles
do
as
they
like
with
us
jews
the
next
time
vanka
abused
me
i
did
not
cry
but
ran
for
shelter
saying
to
myself
vanka
is
a
gentile
the
third
time
when
vanka
spat
on
me
i
wiped
my
face
and
thought
nothing
at
all
i
accepted
from
the
gentiles
as
one
accepts
the
weather
the
world
was
made
in
a
certain
way
and
i
had
to
live
in
it
not
quite
all
the
gentiles
were
like
vanka
next
door
to
us
lived
a
gentile
family
which
was
very
friendly
there
was
a
girl
as
big
as
i
who
never
called
me
names
and
gave
me
flowers
from
her
garden
and
there
were
the
parphens
of
whom
my
grandfather
rented
his
store
they
treated
us
as
if
we
were
not
jews
at
all
on
our
festival
days
they
visited
our
house
and
brought
us
presents
carefully
choosing
such
things
as
jewish
children
might
accept
and
they
liked
to
have
everything
explained
to
them
about
the
wine
and
the
fruit
and
the
candles
and
they
even
tried
to
say
the
appropriate
greetings
and
blessings
in
hebrew
my
father
used
to
say
that
if
all
the
russians
were
like
the
parphens
there
would
be
no
trouble
between
gentiles
and
jews
and
fedora
pavlovna
the
landlady
would
reply
that
the
russian
were
not
to
blame
it
was
the
priests
she
said
who
taught
the
people
to
hate
the
jews
of
course
she
knew
best
as
she
was
a
very
pious
christian
she
never
passed
a
church
without
crossing
herself
the
gentiles
were
always
crossing
themselves
when
they
went
into
a
church
and
when
they
came
out
when
they
met
a
priest
or
passed
an
image
in
the
street
the
dirty
beggars
on
the
church
steps
never
stopped
crossing
themselves
and
even
when
they
stood
on
the
corner
of
a
jewish
street
and
received
alms
from
jewish
people
they
crossed
themselves
and
mumbled
christian
prayers
in
every
gentile
house
there
was
what
they
called
an
icon
which
was
an
image
or
picture
of
the
christian
god
hung
up
in
a
corner
with
a
light
always
burning
before
it
in
front
of
the
icon
the
gentiles
said
their
prayers
on
their
knees
crossing
themselves
all
the
time
i
tried
not
to
look
in
the
corner
where
the
icon
was
when
i
came
into
a
gentile
house
i
was
afraid
of
the
cross
everybody
was
in
polotzk
all
the
jews
i
mean
for
it
was
the
cross
that
made
the
priests
and
the
priests
made
our
troubles
as
even
some
christians
admitted
the
gentiles
said
that
we
had
killed
their
god
which
was
absurd
as
they
never
had
a
god
nothing
but
images
besides
what
they
accused
us
of
had
happened
so
long
ago
the
gentiles
themselves
said
it
was
long
ago
everybody
had
been
dead
for
ages
who
could
have
had
anything
to
do
with
it
yet
they
put
up
crosses
everywhere
and
wore
them
on
their
necks
on
purpose
to
remind
themselves
of
these
false
things
and
they
considered
it
pious
to
hate
and
abuse
us
insisting
that
we
had
killed
their
god
to
worship
the
cross
and
to
torment
a
jew
was
the
same
thing
to
them
that
is
why
we
feared
the
cross
another
thing
the
gentiles
said
about
us
was
that
we
used
the
blood
of
murdered
christian
children
at
the
passover
festival
of
course
that
was
a
wicked
lie
it
made
me
sick
to
think
of
such
a
thing
i
knew
everything
that
was
done
for
passover
from
the
time
i
was
a
very
little
girl
the
house
was
made
clean
and
shining
and
holy
even
in
the
corners
where
nobody
ever
looked
vessels
and
dishes
that
were
used
all
the
year
round
were
put
away
in
the
garret
and
special
vessels
were
brought
out
for
the
passover
week
i
used
to
help
unpack
the
new
dishes
and
find
my
own
blue
mug
when
the
fresh
curtains
were
put
up
and
the
white
floors
were
uncovered
and
everybody
in
the
house
put
on
new
clothes
and
i
sat
down
to
the
feast
in
my
new
dress
i
felt
clean
inside
and
out
and
when
i
asked
the
four
questions
about
the
unleavened
bread
and
the
bitter
herbs
and
the
other
things
and
the
family
reading
from
their
books
answered
me
did
i
not
know
all
about
passover
and
what
was
on
the
table
and
why
it
was
wicked
of
the
gentiles
to
tell
lies
about
us
the
youngest
child
in
the
house
knew
how
passover
was
kept
the
passover
season
when
we
celebrated
our
deliverance
from
the
land
of
egypt
and
felt
so
glad
and
thankful
as
if
it
had
only
just
happened
was
the
time
our
gentile
neighbors
chose
to
remind
us
that
russia
was
another
egypt
that
is
what
i
heard
people
say
and
it
was
true
it
was
not
so
bad
in
polotzk
within
the
pale
but
in
russian
cities
and
even
more
in
the
country
districts
where
jewish
families
lived
scattered
by
special
permission
of
the
police
who
were
always
changing
their
minds
about
letting
them
stay
the
gentiles
made
the
passover
a
time
of
horror
for
the
jews
somebody
would
start
up
that
lie
about
murdering
christian
children
and
the
stupid
peasants
would
get
mad
about
it
and
fill
themselves
with
vodka
and
set
out
to
kill
the
jews
they
attacked
them
with
knives
and
clubs
and
scythes
and
axes
killed
them
or
tortured
them
and
burned
their
houses
this
was
called
a
pogrom
jews
who
escaped
the
pogroms
came
to
polotzk
with
wounds
on
them
and
horrible
horrible
stories
of
little
babies
torn
limb
from
limb
before
their
mothers
eyes
only
to
hear
these
things
made
one
sob
and
sob
and
choke
with
pain
people
who
saw
such
things
never
smiled
any
more
no
matter
how
long
they
lived
and
sometimes
their
hair
turned
white
in
a
day
and
some
people
became
insane
on
the
spot
often
we
heard
that
the
pogrom
was
led
by
a
priest
carrying
a
cross
before
the
mob
our
enemies
always
held
up
the
cross
as
the
excuse
of
their
cruelty
to
us
i
never
was
in
an
actual
pogrom
but
there
were
times
when
it
threatened
us
even
in
polotzk
and
in
all
my
fearful
imaginings
as
i
hid
in
dark
corners
thinking
of
the
horrible
things
the
gentiles
were
going
to
do
to
me
i
saw
the
cross
the
cruel
cross
i
remember
a
time
when
i
thought
a
pogrom
had
broken
out
in
our
street
and
i
wonder
that
i
did
not
die
of
fear
it
was
some
christian
holiday
and
we
had
been
warned
by
the
police
to
keep
indoors
gates
were
locked
shutters
were
barred
if
a
child
cried
the
nurse
threatened
to
give
it
to
the
priest
who
would
soon
be
passing
by
fearful
and
yet
curious
we
looked
through
the
cracks
in
the
shutters
we
saw
a
procession
of
peasants
and
townspeople
led
by
a
number
of
priests
carrying
crosses
and
banners
and
images
in
the
place
of
honor
was
carried
a
casket
containing
a
relic
from
the
monastery
in
the
outskirts
of
polotzk
once
a
year
the
gentiles
paraded
with
this
relic
and
on
that
occasion
the
streets
were
considered
too
holy
for
jews
to
be
about
and
we
lived
in
fear
till
the
end
of
the
day
knowing
that
the
least
disturbance
might
start
a
riot
and
a
riot
lead
to
a
pogrom
on
the
day
when
i
saw
the
procession
through
a
crack
in
the
shutter
there
were
soldiers
and
police
in
the
street
this
was
as
usual
but
i
did
not
know
it
i
asked
the
nurse
who
was
pressing
to
the
crack
over
my
head
what
the
soldiers
were
for
thoughtlessly
she
answered
me
in
case
of
a
pogrom
yes
there
were
the
crosses
and
the
priests
and
the
mob
the
church
bells
were
pealing
their
loudest
everything
was
ready
the
gentiles
were
going
to
tear
me
in
pieces
with
axes
and
knives
and
ropes
they
were
going
to
burn
me
alive
the
cross
the
cross
what
would
they
do
to
me
first
there
was
one
thing
the
gentiles
might
do
to
me
worse
than
burning
or
rending
it
was
what
was
done
to
unprotected
jewish
children
who
fell
into
the
hands
of
priests
or
nuns
they
might
baptize
me
that
would
be
worse
than
death
by
torture
rather
would
i
drown
in
the
dvina
than
a
drop
of
the
baptismal
water
should
touch
my
forehead
to
be
forced
to
kneel
before
the
hideous
images
to
kiss
the
cross
sooner
would
i
rush
out
to
the
mob
that
was
passing
and
let
them
tear
my
vitals
out
to
forswear
the
one
god
to
bow
before
idols
rather
would
i
be
seized
with
the
plague
and
be
eaten
up
by
vermin
i
was
only
a
little
girl
and
not
very
brave
little
pains
made
me
ill
and
i
cried
but
there
was
no
pain
that
i
would
not
bear
no
none
rather
than
submit
to
baptism
every
jewish
child
had
that
feeling
there
were
stories
by
the
dozen
of
jewish
boys
who
were
kidnapped
by
the
czar
agents
and
brought
up
in
gentile
families
till
they
were
old
enough
to
enter
the
army
where
they
served
till
forty
years
of
age
and
all
those
years
the
priests
tried
by
bribes
and
daily
tortures
to
force
them
to
accept
baptism
but
in
vain
this
was
in
the
time
of
nicholas
i
but
men
who
had
been
through
this
service
were
no
older
than
my
grandfather
when
i
was
a
little
girl
and
they
told
their
experiences
with
their
own
lips
and
one
knew
it
was
true
and
it
broke
one
heart
with
pain
and
pride
some
of
these
soldiers
of
nicholas
as
they
were
called
were
taken
as
little
boys
of
seven
or
eight
snatched
from
their
mothers
laps
they
were
carried
to
distant
villages
where
their
friends
could
never
trace
them
and
turned
over
to
some
dirty
brutal
peasant
who
used
them
like
slaves
and
kept
them
with
the
pigs
no
two
were
ever
left
together
and
they
were
given
false
names
so
that
they
were
entirely
cut
off
from
their
own
world
and
then
the
lonely
child
was
turned
over
to
the
priests
and
he
was
flogged
and
starved
and
terrified
a
little
helpless
boy
who
cried
for
his
mother
but
still
he
refused
to
be
baptized
the
priests
promised
him
good
things
to
eat
and
fine
clothes
and
freedom
from
labor
but
the
boy
turned
away
and
said
his
prayers
secretly
the
hebrew
prayers
as
he
grew
older
severer
tortures
were
invented
for
him
still
he
refused
baptism
by
this
time
he
had
forgotten
his
mother
face
and
of
his
prayers
perhaps
only
the
shema
remained
in
his
memory
but
he
was
a
jew
and
nothing
would
make
him
change
after
he
entered
the
army
he
was
bribed
with
promises
of
promotions
and
honors
he
remained
a
private
and
endured
the
cruellest
discipline
when
he
was
discharged
at
the
age
of
forty
he
was
a
broken
man
without
a
home
without
a
clue
to
his
origin
and
he
spent
the
rest
of
his
life
wandering
among
jewish
settlements
searching
for
his
family
hiding
the
scars
of
torture
under
his
rags
begging
his
way
from
door
to
door
if
he
were
one
who
had
broken
down
under
the
cruel
torments
and
allowed
himself
to
be
baptized
for
the
sake
of
a
respite
the
church
never
let
him
go
again
no
matter
how
loudly
he
protested
that
he
was
still
a
jew
if
he
was
caught
practicing
jewish
rites
he
was
subjected
to
the
severest
punishment
my
father
knew
of
one
who
was
taken
as
a
small
boy
who
never
yielded
to
the
priests
under
the
most
hideous
tortures
as
he
was
a
very
bright
boy
the
priests
were
particularly
eager
to
convert
him
they
tried
him
with
bribes
that
would
appeal
to
his
ambition
they
promised
to
make
a
great
man
of
him
a
general
a
noble
the
boy
turned
away
and
said
his
prayers
then
they
tortured
him
and
threw
him
into
a
cell
and
when
he
lay
asleep
from
exhaustion
the
priest
came
and
baptized
him
when
he
awoke
they
told
him
he
was
a
christian
and
brought
him
the
crucifix
to
kiss
he
protested
threw
the
crucifix
from
him
but
they
held
him
to
it
that
he
was
a
baptized
jew
and
belonged
to
the
church
and
the
rest
of
his
life
he
spent
between
the
prison
and
the
hospital
always
clinging
to
his
faith
saying
the
hebrew
prayers
in
defiance
of
his
tormentors
and
paying
for
it
with
his
flesh
there
were
men
in
polotzk
whose
faces
made
you
old
in
a
minute
they
had
served
nicholas
i
and
come
back
unbaptized
the
white
church
in
the
square
how
did
it
look
to
them
i
knew
i
cursed
the
church
in
my
heart
every
time
i
had
to
pass
it
and
i
was
afraid
afraid
on
market
days
when
the
peasants
came
to
church
and
the
bells
kept
ringing
by
the
hour
my
heart
was
heavy
in
me
and
i
could
find
no
rest
even
in
my
father
house
i
did
not
feel
safe
the
church
bell
boomed
over
the
roofs
of
the
houses
calling
calling
calling
i
closed
my
eyes
and
saw
the
people
passing
into
the
church
peasant
women
with
bright
embroidered
aprons
and
glass
beads
barefoot
little
girls
with
colored
kerchiefs
on
their
heads
boys
with
caps
pulled
too
far
down
over
their
flaxen
hair
rough
men
with
plaited
bast
sandals
and
a
rope
around
the
waist
crowds
of
them
moving
slowly
up
the
steps
crossing
themselves
again
and
again
till
they
were
swallowed
by
the
black
doorway
and
only
the
beggars
were
left
squatting
on
the
steps
boom
what
are
the
people
doing
in
the
dark
with
the
waxen
images
and
the
horrid
crucifixes
boom
boom
they
are
ringing
the
bell
for
me
is
it
in
the
church
they
will
torture
me
when
i
refuse
to
kiss
the
cross
they
ought
not
to
have
told
me
those
dreadful
stories
they
were
long
past
we
were
living
under
the
blessed
new
régime
alexander
iii
was
no
friend
of
the
jews
still
he
did
not
order
little
boys
to
be
taken
from
their
mothers
to
be
made
into
soldiers
and
christians
every
man
had
to
serve
in
the
army
for
four
years
and
a
jewish
recruit
was
likely
to
be
treated
with
severity
no
matter
if
his
behavior
were
perfect
but
that
was
little
compared
to
the
dreadful
conditions
of
the
old
régime
the
thing
that
really
mattered
was
the
necessity
of
breaking
the
jewish
laws
of
daily
life
while
in
the
service
a
soldier
often
had
to
eat
trefah
and
work
on
sabbath
he
had
to
shave
his
beard
and
do
reverence
to
christian
things
he
could
not
attend
daily
services
at
the
synagogue
his
private
devotions
were
disturbed
by
the
jeers
and
insults
of
his
coarse
gentile
comrades
he
might
resort
to
all
sorts
of
tricks
and
shams
still
he
was
obliged
to
violate
jewish
law
when
he
returned
home
at
the
end
of
his
term
of
service
he
could
not
rid
himself
of
the
stigma
of
those
enforced
sins
for
four
years
he
had
led
the
life
of
a
gentile
piety
alone
was
enough
to
make
the
jews
dread
military
service
but
there
were
other
things
that
made
it
a
serious
burden
most
men
of
the
age
of
conscription
were
already
married
and
had
children
during
their
absence
their
families
suffered
their
business
often
was
ruined
at
the
end
of
their
term
they
were
beggars
as
beggars
too
they
were
sent
home
from
their
military
post
if
they
happened
to
have
a
good
uniform
at
the
time
of
their
dismissal
it
was
stripped
from
them
and
replaced
by
a
shabby
one
they
received
a
free
ticket
for
the
return
journey
and
a
few
kopecks
a
day
for
expenses
in
this
fashion
they
were
hurried
back
into
the
pale
like
escaped
prisoners
the
czar
was
done
with
them
if
within
a
limited
time
they
were
found
outside
the
pale
they
would
be
seized
and
sent
home
in
chains
there
were
certain
exceptions
to
the
rule
of
compulsory
service
the
only
son
of
a
family
was
exempt
and
certain
others
in
the
physical
examination
preceding
conscription
many
were
rejected
on
account
of
various
faults
this
gave
the
people
the
idea
of
inflicting
injuries
on
themselves
so
as
to
produce
temporary
deformities
on
account
of
which
they
might
be
rejected
at
the
examination
men
would
submit
to
operations
on
their
eyes
ears
or
limbs
which
caused
them
horrible
sufferings
in
the
hope
of
escaping
the
service
if
the
operation
was
successful
the
patient
was
rejected
by
the
examining
officers
and
in
a
short
time
he
was
well
and
a
free
man
often
however
the
deformity
intended
to
be
temporary
proved
incurable
so
that
there
were
many
men
in
polotzk
blind
of
one
eye
or
hard
of
hearing
or
lame
as
a
result
of
these
secret
practices
but
these
things
were
easier
to
bear
than
the
memory
of
four
years
in
the
czar
service
sons
of
rich
fathers
could
escape
service
without
leaving
any
marks
on
their
persons
it
was
always
possible
to
bribe
conscription
officers
this
was
a
dangerous
practice
it
was
not
the
officers
who
suffered
most
in
case
the
negotiations
leaked
out
but
no
respectable
family
would
let
a
son
be
taken
as
a
recruit
till
it
had
made
every
effort
to
save
him
my
grandfather
nearly
ruined
himself
to
buy
his
sons
out
of
service
and
my
mother
tells
thrilling
anecdotes
of
her
younger
brother
life
who
for
years
lived
in
hiding
under
assumed
names
and
in
various
disguises
till
he
had
passed
the
age
of
liability
for
service
if
it
were
cowardice
that
made
the
jews
shrink
from
military
service
they
would
not
inflict
on
themselves
physical
tortures
greater
than
any
that
threatened
them
in
the
army
and
which
often
left
them
maimed
for
life
if
it
were
avarice
the
fear
of
losing
the
gains
from
their
business
for
four
years
they
would
not
empty
their
pockets
and
sell
their
houses
and
sink
into
debt
on
the
chance
of
successfully
bribing
the
czar
agents
the
jewish
recruit
dreaded
indeed
brutality
and
injustice
at
the
hands
of
officers
and
comrades
he
feared
for
his
family
which
he
left
often
enough
as
dependents
on
the
charity
of
relatives
but
the
fear
of
an
unholy
life
was
greater
than
all
other
fears
i
know
for
i
remember
my
cousin
who
was
taken
as
a
soldier
everything
had
been
done
to
save
him
money
had
been
spent
freely
my
uncle
did
not
stop
at
his
unmarried
daughter
portion
when
everything
else
was
gone
my
cousin
had
also
submitted
to
some
secret
treatment
some
devastating
drug
administered
for
months
before
the
examination
but
the
effects
were
not
pronounced
enough
and
he
was
passed
for
the
first
few
weeks
his
company
was
stationed
in
polotzk
i
saw
my
cousin
drill
on
the
square
carrying
a
gun
a
i
felt
unholy
as
if
i
had
sinned
the
sin
in
my
own
person
it
was
easy
to
understand
why
mothers
of
conscript
sons
fasted
and
wept
and
prayed
and
worried
themselves
to
their
graves
there
was
a
man
in
our
town
called
david
the
substitute
because
he
had
gone
as
a
soldier
in
another
stead
he
himself
being
exempt
he
did
it
for
a
sum
of
money
i
suppose
his
family
was
starving
and
he
saw
a
chance
to
provide
for
them
for
a
few
years
but
it
was
a
sinful
thing
to
do
to
go
as
a
soldier
and
be
obliged
to
live
like
a
gentile
of
his
own
free
will
and
david
knew
how
wicked
it
was
for
he
was
a
pious
man
at
heart
when
he
returned
from
service
he
was
aged
and
broken
bowed
down
with
the
sense
of
his
sins
and
he
set
himself
a
penance
which
was
to
go
through
the
streets
every
sabbath
morning
calling
the
people
to
prayer
now
this
was
a
hard
thing
to
do
because
david
labored
bitterly
all
the
week
exposed
to
the
weather
summer
or
winter
and
on
sabbath
morning
there
was
nobody
so
tired
and
lame
and
sore
as
david
yet
he
forced
himself
to
leave
his
bed
before
it
was
yet
daylight
and
go
from
street
to
street
all
over
polotzk
calling
on
the
people
to
wake
and
go
to
prayer
many
a
sabbath
morning
i
awoke
when
david
called
and
lay
listening
to
his
voice
as
it
passed
and
died
out
and
it
was
so
sad
that
it
hurt
as
beautiful
music
hurts
i
was
glad
to
feel
my
sister
lying
beside
me
for
it
was
lonely
in
the
gray
dawn
with
only
david
and
me
awake
and
god
waiting
for
the
people
prayers
the
gentiles
used
to
wonder
at
us
because
we
cared
so
much
about
religious
things
about
food
and
sabbath
and
teaching
the
children
hebrew
they
were
angry
with
us
for
our
obstinacy
as
they
called
it
and
mocked
us
and
ridiculed
the
most
sacred
things
there
were
wise
gentiles
who
understood
these
were
educated
people
like
fedora
pavlovna
who
made
friends
with
their
jewish
neighbors
they
were
always
respectful
and
openly
admired
some
of
our
ways
but
most
of
the
gentiles
were
ignorant
and
distrustful
and
spiteful
they
would
not
believe
that
there
was
any
good
in
our
religion
and
of
course
we
dared
not
teach
them
because
we
should
be
accused
of
trying
to
convert
them
and
that
would
be
the
end
of
us
oh
if
they
could
only
understand
vanka
caught
me
on
the
street
one
day
and
pulled
my
hair
and
called
me
names
and
all
of
a
sudden
i
asked
myself
a
thing
i
had
stopped
asking
years
before
i
was
so
angry
that
i
could
have
punished
him
for
one
moment
i
was
not
afraid
to
hit
back
but
this
broke
out
in
my
heart
and
i
forgot
to
revenge
myself
it
was
so
wonderful
well
there
were
no
words
in
my
head
to
say
it
but
it
meant
that
vanka
abused
me
only
because
did
not
if
he
could
feel
with
my
heart
if
he
could
be
a
little
jewish
boy
for
one
day
i
thought
he
would
know
he
would
know
if
he
could
understand
about
david
the
substitute
now
without
being
told
as
i
understood
if
he
could
wake
in
my
place
on
sabbath
morning
and
feel
his
heart
break
in
him
with
a
strange
pain
because
a
jew
had
dishonored
the
law
of
moses
and
god
was
bending
down
to
pardon
him
oh
why
could
i
not
make
vanka
understand
i
was
so
sorry
that
my
heart
hurt
me
worse
than
vanka
blows
my
anger
and
my
courage
were
gone
vanka
was
throwing
stones
at
me
now
from
his
mother
doorway
and
i
continued
on
my
errand
but
i
did
not
hurry
the
thing
that
hurt
me
most
i
could
not
run
away
from
there
was
one
thing
the
gentiles
always
understood
and
that
was
money
they
would
take
any
kind
of
bribe
at
any
time
peace
cost
so
much
a
year
in
polotzk
if
you
did
not
keep
on
good
terms
with
your
gentile
neighbors
they
had
a
hundred
ways
of
molesting
you
if
you
chased
their
pigs
when
they
came
rooting
up
your
garden
or
objected
to
their
children
maltreating
your
children
they
might
complain
against
you
to
the
police
stuffing
their
case
with
false
accusations
and
false
witnesses
if
you
had
not
made
friends
with
the
police
the
case
might
go
to
court
and
there
you
lost
before
the
trial
was
called
unless
the
judge
had
reason
to
befriend
you
the
cheapest
way
to
live
in
polotzk
was
to
pay
as
you
went
along
even
a
little
girl
understood
that
in
polotzk
perhaps
your
parents
were
in
business
usually
they
were
as
almost
everybody
kept
store
and
you
heard
a
great
deal
about
the
chief
of
police
and
excise
officers
and
other
agents
of
the
czar
between
the
czar
whom
you
had
never
seen
and
the
policeman
whom
you
knew
too
well
you
pictured
to
yourself
a
long
row
of
officials
of
all
sorts
all
with
their
palms
stretched
out
to
receive
your
father
money
you
knew
your
father
hated
them
all
but
you
saw
him
smile
and
bend
as
he
filled
those
greedy
palms
you
did
the
same
in
your
petty
way
when
you
saw
vanka
coming
toward
you
on
a
lonely
street
and
you
held
out
to
him
the
core
of
the
apple
you
had
been
chewing
and
forced
your
unwilling
lips
into
a
smile
it
hurt
that
false
smile
it
made
you
feel
black
inside
in
your
father
parlor
hung
a
large
colored
portrait
of
alexander
iii
the
czar
was
a
cruel
tyrant
oh
it
was
whispered
when
doors
were
locked
and
shutters
tightly
barred
at
night
he
was
a
titus
a
haman
a
sworn
foe
of
all
jews
and
yet
his
portrait
was
seen
in
a
place
of
honor
in
your
father
house
you
knew
why
it
looked
well
when
police
or
government
officers
came
on
business
you
went
out
to
play
one
morning
and
saw
a
little
knot
of
people
gathered
around
a
there
was
a
notice
on
it
a
new
order
from
the
chief
of
police
you
pushed
into
the
crowd
and
stared
at
the
placard
but
you
could
not
read
a
woman
with
a
ragged
shawl
looked
down
upon
you
and
said
with
a
bitter
kind
of
smile
rejoice
rejoice
little
girl
the
chief
of
police
bids
you
rejoice
there
shall
be
a
pretty
flag
flying
from
every
housetop
because
it
is
the
czar
birthday
and
we
must
celebrate
come
and
watch
the
poor
people
pawn
their
samovars
and
candlesticks
to
raise
money
for
a
pretty
flag
it
is
a
holiday
little
girl
rejoice
you
know
the
woman
is
mocking
you
are
familiar
with
the
quality
of
that
smile
but
you
accept
the
hint
and
go
and
watch
the
people
buy
their
flags
your
cousin
keeps
a
store
where
you
have
a
fine
view
of
the
proceedings
there
is
a
crowd
around
the
counter
and
your
cousin
and
the
assistant
are
busily
measuring
off
lengths
of
cloth
red
and
blue
and
white
how
much
does
it
take
somebody
asks
may
i
know
no
more
of
sin
than
i
know
of
flags
another
replies
how
is
it
put
together
do
you
have
to
have
all
three
colors
one
customer
puts
down
a
few
kopecks
on
the
counter
saying
give
me
a
piece
of
flag
this
is
all
the
money
i
have
give
me
the
red
and
the
blue
i
tear
up
my
shirt
for
the
white
you
know
it
is
no
joke
the
flag
must
show
from
every
house
or
the
owner
will
be
dragged
to
the
police
station
to
pay
a
fine
of
rubles
what
happened
to
the
old
woman
who
lives
in
that
shanty
over
the
way
it
was
that
other
time
when
flags
were
ordered
up
because
the
grand
duke
was
to
visit
polotzk
the
old
woman
had
no
flag
and
no
money
she
hoped
the
policeman
would
not
notice
her
miserable
hut
but
he
did
the
vigilant
one
and
he
went
up
and
kicked
the
door
open
with
his
great
boot
and
he
took
the
last
pillow
from
the
bed
and
sold
it
and
hoisted
a
flag
above
the
rotten
roof
i
knew
the
old
woman
well
with
her
one
watery
eye
and
her
crumpled
hands
i
often
took
a
plate
of
soup
to
her
from
our
kitchen
there
was
nothing
but
rags
left
on
her
bed
when
the
policeman
had
taken
the
pillow
the
czar
always
got
his
dues
no
matter
if
it
ruined
a
family
there
was
a
poor
locksmith
who
owed
the
czar
three
hundred
rubles
because
his
brother
had
escaped
from
russia
before
serving
his
term
in
the
army
there
was
no
such
fine
for
gentiles
only
for
jews
and
the
whole
family
was
liable
now
the
locksmith
never
could
have
so
much
money
and
he
had
no
valuables
to
pawn
the
police
came
and
attached
his
household
goods
everything
he
had
including
his
young
trousseau
and
the
sale
of
the
goods
brought
rubles
after
a
year
time
the
police
came
again
looking
for
the
balance
of
the
czar
dues
they
put
their
seal
on
everything
they
found
the
bride
was
in
bed
with
her
first
baby
a
boy
the
circumcision
was
to
be
next
day
the
police
did
not
leave
a
sheet
to
wrap
the
child
in
when
he
is
handed
up
for
the
operation
many
bitter
sayings
came
to
your
ears
if
you
were
a
jewish
little
girl
in
polotzk
it
is
a
false
world
you
heard
and
you
knew
it
was
so
looking
at
the
czar
portrait
and
at
the
flags
never
tell
a
police
officer
the
truth
was
another
saying
and
you
knew
it
was
good
advice
that
fine
of
three
hundred
rubles
was
a
sentence
of
lifelong
slavery
for
the
poor
locksmith
unless
he
freed
himself
by
some
trick
as
fast
as
he
could
collect
a
few
rags
and
sticks
the
police
would
be
after
them
he
might
hide
under
a
false
name
if
he
could
get
away
from
polotzk
on
a
false
passport
or
he
might
bribe
the
proper
officials
to
issue
a
false
certificate
of
the
missing
brother
death
only
by
false
means
could
he
secure
peace
for
himself
and
his
family
as
long
as
the
czar
was
after
his
dues
it
was
bewildering
to
hear
how
many
kinds
of
duties
and
taxes
we
owed
the
czar
we
paid
taxes
on
our
houses
and
taxes
on
the
rents
from
the
houses
taxes
on
our
business
taxes
on
our
profits
i
am
not
sure
whether
there
were
taxes
on
our
losses
the
town
collected
taxes
and
the
county
and
the
central
government
and
the
chief
of
police
we
had
always
with
us
there
were
taxes
for
public
works
but
rotten
pavements
went
on
rotting
year
after
year
and
when
a
bridge
was
to
be
built
special
taxes
were
levied
a
bridge
by
the
way
was
not
always
a
public
highway
a
railroad
bridge
across
the
dvina
while
open
to
the
military
could
be
used
by
the
people
only
by
individual
permission
my
uncle
explained
to
me
all
about
the
excise
duties
on
tobacco
tobacco
being
a
source
of
government
revenue
there
was
a
heavy
tax
on
it
cigarettes
were
taxed
at
every
step
of
their
process
the
tobacco
was
taxed
separately
and
the
paper
and
the
mouthpiece
and
on
the
finished
product
an
additional
tax
was
put
there
was
no
tax
on
the
smoke
the
czar
must
have
overlooked
it
business
really
did
not
pay
when
the
price
of
goods
was
so
swollen
by
taxes
that
the
people
could
not
buy
the
only
way
to
make
business
pay
was
to
cheat
cheat
the
government
of
part
of
the
duties
but
playing
tricks
on
the
czar
was
dangerous
with
so
many
spies
watching
his
interests
people
who
sold
cigarettes
without
the
government
seal
got
more
gray
hairs
than
bank
notes
out
of
their
business
the
constant
risk
the
worry
the
dread
of
a
police
raid
in
the
night
and
the
ruinous
fines
in
case
of
detection
left
very
little
margin
of
profit
or
comfort
to
the
dealer
in
contraband
goods
but
what
can
one
do
the
people
said
with
the
shrug
of
the
shoulders
that
expresses
the
helplessness
of
the
pale
what
can
one
do
one
must
live
it
was
not
easy
to
live
with
such
bitter
competition
as
the
congestion
of
population
made
inevitable
there
were
ten
times
as
many
stores
as
there
should
have
been
ten
times
as
many
tailors
cobblers
barbers
tinsmiths
a
gentile
if
he
failed
in
polotzk
could
go
elsewhere
where
there
was
less
competition
a
jew
could
make
the
circle
of
the
pale
only
to
find
the
same
conditions
as
at
home
outside
the
pale
he
could
only
go
to
certain
designated
localities
on
payment
of
prohibitive
fees
augmented
by
a
constant
stream
of
bribes
and
even
then
he
lived
at
the
mercy
of
the
local
chief
of
police
artisans
had
the
right
to
reside
outside
the
pale
on
fulfilment
of
certain
conditions
this
sounded
easy
to
me
when
i
was
a
little
girl
till
i
realized
how
it
worked
there
was
a
capmaker
who
had
duly
qualified
by
passing
an
examination
and
paying
for
his
trade
papers
to
live
in
a
certain
city
the
chief
of
police
suddenly
took
it
into
his
head
to
impeach
the
genuineness
of
his
papers
the
capmaker
was
obliged
to
travel
to
petersburg
where
he
had
qualified
in
the
first
place
to
repeat
the
examination
he
spent
the
savings
of
years
in
petty
bribes
trying
to
hasten
the
process
but
was
detained
ten
months
by
bureaucratic
red
tape
when
at
length
he
returned
to
his
home
town
he
found
a
new
chief
of
police
installed
during
his
absence
who
discovered
a
new
flaw
in
the
papers
he
had
just
obtained
and
expelled
him
from
the
city
if
he
came
to
polotzk
there
were
then
eleven
capmakers
where
only
one
could
make
a
living
merchants
fared
like
the
artisans
they
too
could
buy
the
right
of
residence
outside
the
pale
permanent
or
temporary
on
conditions
that
gave
them
no
real
security
i
was
proud
to
have
an
uncle
who
was
a
merchant
of
the
first
guild
but
it
was
very
expensive
for
my
uncle
he
had
to
pay
so
much
a
year
for
the
title
and
a
certain
percentage
on
the
profits
from
his
business
this
gave
him
the
right
to
travel
on
business
outside
the
pale
twice
a
year
for
not
more
than
six
months
in
all
if
he
were
found
outside
the
pale
after
his
permit
expired
he
had
to
pay
a
fine
that
exceeded
all
he
had
gained
by
his
journey
perhaps
i
used
to
picture
my
uncle
on
his
russian
travels
hurrying
hurrying
to
finish
his
business
in
the
limited
time
while
a
policeman
marched
behind
him
ticking
off
the
days
and
counting
up
the
hours
that
was
a
foolish
fancy
but
some
of
the
things
that
were
done
in
russia
really
were
very
funny
there
were
things
in
polotzk
that
made
you
laugh
with
one
eye
and
weep
with
the
other
like
a
clown
during
an
epidemic
of
cholera
the
city
officials
suddenly
becoming
energetic
opened
stations
for
the
distribution
of
disinfectants
to
the
people
a
quarter
of
the
population
was
dead
when
they
began
and
most
of
the
dead
were
buried
while
some
lay
decaying
in
deserted
houses
the
survivors
some
of
them
crazy
from
horror
stole
through
the
empty
streets
avoiding
one
another
till
they
came
to
the
appointed
stations
where
they
pushed
and
crowded
to
get
their
little
bottles
of
carbolic
acid
many
died
from
fear
in
those
horrible
days
but
some
must
have
died
from
laughter
for
only
the
gentiles
were
allowed
to
receive
the
disinfectant
poor
jews
who
had
nothing
but
their
graves
were
driven
away
from
the
stations
perhaps
it
was
wrong
of
us
to
think
of
our
gentile
neighbors
as
a
different
species
of
beings
from
ourselves
but
such
madness
as
that
did
not
help
to
make
them
more
human
in
our
eyes
it
was
easier
to
be
friends
with
the
beasts
in
the
barn
than
with
some
of
the
gentiles
the
cow
and
the
goat
and
the
cat
responded
to
kindness
and
remembered
which
of
the
housemaids
was
generous
and
which
was
cross
the
gentiles
made
no
distinctions
a
jew
was
a
jew
to
be
hated
and
spat
upon
and
used
spitefully
the
only
gentiles
besides
the
few
of
the
intelligent
kind
who
did
not
habitually
look
upon
us
with
hate
and
contempt
were
the
stupid
peasants
from
the
country
who
were
hardly
human
themselves
they
lived
in
filthy
huts
together
with
their
swine
and
all
they
cared
for
was
how
to
get
something
to
eat
it
was
not
their
fault
the
land
laws
made
them
so
poor
that
they
had
to
sell
themselves
to
fill
their
bellies
what
help
was
there
for
us
in
the
good
will
of
such
wretched
slaves
for
a
cask
of
vodka
you
could
buy
up
a
whole
village
of
them
they
trembled
before
the
meanest
townsman
and
at
a
sign
from
a
priest
they
would
sharpen
their
axes
against
us
the
gentiles
had
their
excuse
for
their
malice
they
said
our
merchants
and
preyed
upon
them
and
our
shopkeepers
gave
false
measure
people
who
want
to
defend
the
jews
ought
never
to
deny
this
yes
i
say
we
cheated
the
gentiles
whenever
we
dared
because
it
was
the
only
thing
to
do
remember
how
the
czar
was
always
sending
us
commands
you
shall
not
do
this
and
you
shall
not
do
that
until
there
was
little
left
that
we
might
honestly
do
except
pay
tribute
and
die
there
he
had
us
cooped
up
thousands
of
us
where
only
hundreds
could
live
and
every
means
of
living
taxed
to
the
utmost
when
there
are
too
many
wolves
in
the
prairie
they
begin
to
prey
upon
each
other
we
starving
captives
of
the
pale
we
did
as
do
the
hungry
brutes
but
our
humanity
showed
in
our
discrimination
between
our
victims
whenever
we
could
we
spared
our
own
kind
directing
against
our
racial
foes
the
cunning
wiles
which
our
bitter
need
invented
is
not
that
the
code
of
war
encamped
in
the
midst
of
the
enemy
we
could
practice
no
other
a
jew
could
hardly
exist
in
business
unless
he
developed
a
dual
conscience
which
allowed
him
to
do
to
the
gentile
what
he
would
call
a
sin
against
a
fellow
jew
such
spiritual
deformities
are
in
the
of
the
czar
a
glance
over
the
statutes
of
the
pale
leaves
you
wondering
that
the
russian
jews
have
not
lost
all
semblance
to
humanity
illustration
the
grave
digger
of
polotzk
a
favorite
complaint
against
us
was
that
we
were
greedy
for
gold
why
could
not
the
gentiles
see
the
whole
truth
where
they
saw
half
greedy
for
profits
we
were
eager
for
bargains
for
savings
intent
on
squeezing
the
utmost
out
of
every
business
transaction
but
why
did
not
the
gentiles
know
the
reason
did
they
not
know
what
price
we
had
to
pay
for
the
air
we
breathed
if
a
jew
and
a
gentile
kept
store
side
by
side
the
gentile
could
content
himself
with
smaller
profits
he
did
not
have
to
buy
permission
to
travel
in
the
interests
of
his
business
he
did
not
have
to
pay
three
hundred
rubles
fine
if
his
son
evaded
military
service
he
was
saved
the
expense
of
hushing
inciters
of
pogroms
police
favor
was
retailed
at
a
lower
price
to
him
than
to
the
jew
his
nature
did
not
compel
him
to
support
schools
and
charities
it
cost
nothing
to
be
a
christian
on
the
contrary
it
brought
rewards
and
immunities
to
be
a
jew
was
a
costly
luxury
the
price
of
which
was
either
money
or
blood
is
it
any
wonder
that
we
hoarded
our
pennies
what
his
shield
is
to
the
soldier
in
battle
that
was
the
ruble
to
the
jew
in
the
pale
the
knowledge
of
such
things
as
i
am
telling
leaves
marks
upon
the
flesh
and
spirit
i
remember
little
children
in
polotzk
with
old
old
faces
and
eyes
glazed
with
secrets
i
knew
how
to
dodge
and
cringe
and
dissemble
before
i
knew
the
names
of
the
seasons
and
i
had
plenty
of
time
to
ponder
on
these
things
because
i
was
so
idle
if
they
had
let
me
go
to
school
now
but
of
course
they
did
there
was
no
free
school
for
girls
and
even
if
your
parents
were
rich
enough
to
send
you
to
a
private
school
you
could
not
go
very
far
at
the
high
school
which
was
under
government
control
jewish
children
were
admitted
in
limited
numbers
only
ten
to
every
hundred
and
even
if
you
were
among
the
lucky
ones
you
had
your
troubles
the
tutor
who
prepared
you
talked
all
the
time
about
the
examinations
you
would
have
to
pass
till
you
were
scared
you
heard
on
all
sides
that
the
brightest
jewish
children
were
turned
down
if
the
examining
officers
did
not
like
the
turn
of
their
noses
you
went
up
to
be
examined
with
the
other
jewish
children
your
heart
heavy
about
that
matter
of
your
nose
there
was
a
special
examination
for
the
jewish
candidates
of
course
a
jewish
child
had
to
answer
questions
that
a
gentile
was
hardly
expected
to
understand
but
that
did
not
matter
so
much
you
had
been
prepared
for
the
test
you
found
the
questions
quite
easy
you
wrote
your
answers
triumphantly
and
you
received
a
low
rating
and
there
was
no
appeal
i
used
to
stand
in
the
doorway
of
my
father
store
munching
an
apple
that
did
not
taste
good
any
more
and
watch
the
pupils
going
home
from
school
in
twos
and
threes
the
girls
in
neat
brown
dresses
and
black
aprons
and
little
stiff
hats
the
boys
in
trim
uniforms
with
many
buttons
they
had
ever
so
many
books
in
the
satchels
on
their
backs
they
would
take
them
out
at
home
and
read
and
write
and
learn
all
sorts
of
interesting
things
they
looked
to
me
like
beings
from
another
world
than
mine
but
those
whom
i
envied
had
their
own
troubles
as
i
often
heard
their
school
life
was
one
struggle
against
injustice
from
instructors
spiteful
treatment
from
fellow
students
and
insults
from
everybody
those
who
by
heroic
efforts
and
transcendent
good
luck
successfully
finished
the
course
found
themselves
against
a
new
wall
if
they
wished
to
go
on
they
were
turned
down
at
the
universities
which
admitted
them
in
the
ratio
of
three
jews
to
a
hundred
gentiles
under
the
same
debarring
entrance
conditions
as
at
the
high
school
especially
rigorous
examinations
dishonest
marking
or
arbitrary
rulings
without
disguise
no
the
czar
did
not
want
us
in
the
schools
i
heard
from
my
mother
of
a
different
state
of
affairs
at
the
time
when
her
brothers
were
little
boys
the
czar
of
those
days
had
a
bright
idea
he
said
to
his
ministers
let
us
educate
the
people
let
us
win
over
those
jews
through
the
public
schools
instead
of
allowing
them
to
persist
in
their
narrow
hebrew
learning
which
teaches
them
no
love
for
their
monarch
force
has
failed
with
them
the
unwilling
converts
return
to
their
old
ways
whenever
they
dare
let
us
try
education
perhaps
peaceable
conversion
of
the
jews
was
not
the
czar
only
motive
when
he
opened
public
schools
everywhere
and
compelled
parents
to
send
their
boys
for
instruction
perhaps
he
just
wanted
to
be
good
and
really
hoped
to
benefit
the
country
but
to
the
jews
the
public
schools
appeared
as
a
trap
door
to
the
abyss
of
apostasy
the
instructors
were
always
christians
the
teaching
was
christian
and
the
regulations
of
the
schoolroom
as
to
hours
costume
and
manners
were
often
in
opposition
to
jewish
practices
the
public
school
interrupted
the
boy
sacred
studies
in
the
hebrew
school
where
would
you
look
for
pious
jews
after
a
few
generations
of
boys
brought
up
by
christian
teachers
plainly
the
czar
was
after
the
souls
of
the
jewish
children
the
church
door
gaped
for
them
at
the
end
of
the
school
course
and
all
good
jews
rose
up
against
the
schools
and
by
every
means
fair
or
foul
kept
their
boys
away
the
official
appointed
to
keep
the
register
of
boys
for
school
purposes
waxed
rich
on
the
bribes
paid
him
by
anxious
parents
who
kept
their
sons
in
hiding
after
a
while
the
wise
czar
changed
his
mind
or
he
died
probably
he
did
both
and
the
schools
were
closed
and
the
jewish
boys
perused
their
hebrew
books
in
peace
wearing
the
sacred
fringes
in
plain
sight
and
never
polluting
their
mouths
with
a
word
of
russian
and
then
it
was
the
jews
who
changed
their
minds
some
of
them
they
wanted
to
send
their
children
to
school
to
learn
histories
and
sciences
because
they
had
discovered
that
there
was
good
in
such
things
as
well
as
in
the
sacred
law
these
people
were
called
progressive
but
they
had
no
chance
to
progress
all
the
czars
that
came
along
persisted
in
the
old
idea
that
for
the
jew
no
door
should
be
opened
no
door
out
of
the
pale
no
door
out
of
their
mediævalism
footnotes
a
cloth
with
specially
prepared
fringes
is
worn
by
pious
males
under
the
outer
garments
but
with
the
fringes
showing
the
latter
play
a
part
in
the
daily
ritual
chapter
ii
children
of
the
law
as
i
look
back
i
see
within
the
wall
raised
around
my
birthplace
by
the
vigilance
of
the
police
another
wall
higher
thicker
more
impenetrable
this
is
the
wall
which
the
czar
with
all
his
minions
could
not
shake
the
priests
with
their
instruments
of
torture
could
not
pierce
the
mob
with
their
firebrands
could
not
destroy
this
wall
within
the
wall
is
the
religious
integrity
of
the
jews
a
fortress
erected
by
the
prisoners
of
the
pale
in
defiance
of
their
jailers
a
stronghold
built
of
the
ruins
of
their
pillaged
homes
cemented
with
the
blood
of
their
murdered
children
harassed
on
every
side
thwarted
in
every
normal
effort
pent
up
within
narrow
limits
all
but
dehumanized
the
russian
jew
fell
back
upon
the
only
thing
that
never
failed
him
his
hereditary
faith
in
god
in
the
study
of
the
torah
he
found
the
balm
for
all
his
wounds
the
minute
observance
of
traditional
rites
became
the
expression
of
his
spiritual
cravings
and
in
the
dream
of
a
restoration
to
palestine
he
forgot
the
world
what
did
it
matter
to
us
on
a
sabbath
or
festival
when
our
life
was
centred
in
the
synagogue
what
czar
sat
on
the
throne
what
evil
counsellors
whispered
in
his
ear
they
were
concerned
with
revenues
and
policies
and
ephemeral
trifles
of
all
sorts
while
we
were
intent
on
renewing
our
ancient
covenant
with
god
to
the
end
that
his
promise
to
the
world
should
be
fulfilled
and
his
justice
overwhelm
the
nations
on
a
friday
afternoon
the
stores
and
markets
closed
early
the
clatter
of
business
ceased
the
dust
of
worry
was
laid
and
the
sabbath
peace
flooded
the
quiet
streets
no
hovel
so
mean
but
what
its
casement
sent
out
its
consecrated
ray
so
that
a
wayfarer
passing
in
the
twilight
saw
the
spirit
of
god
brooding
over
the
lowly
roof
care
and
fear
and
shrewishness
dropped
like
a
mask
from
every
face
eyes
dimmed
with
weeping
kindled
with
inmost
joy
wherever
a
head
bent
over
a
sacred
page
there
rested
the
halo
of
god
presence
not
on
festivals
alone
but
also
on
the
common
days
of
the
week
we
lived
by
the
law
that
had
been
given
us
through
our
teacher
moses
how
to
eat
how
to
bathe
how
to
work
everything
had
been
written
down
for
us
and
we
strove
to
fulfil
the
law
the
study
of
the
torah
was
the
most
honored
of
all
occupations
and
they
who
engaged
in
it
the
most
revered
of
all
men
my
memory
does
not
go
back
to
a
time
when
i
was
too
young
to
know
that
god
had
made
the
world
and
had
appointed
teachers
to
tell
the
people
how
to
live
in
it
first
came
moses
and
after
him
the
great
rabbis
and
finally
the
rav
of
polotzk
who
read
all
day
in
the
sacred
books
so
that
he
could
tell
me
and
my
parents
and
my
friends
what
to
do
whenever
we
were
in
doubt
if
my
mother
cut
up
a
chicken
and
found
something
wrong
in
it
some
hurt
or
mark
that
should
not
be
she
sent
the
housemaid
with
it
to
the
rav
and
i
ran
along
and
saw
the
rav
look
in
his
big
books
and
whatever
he
decided
was
right
if
he
called
the
chicken
trefah
i
must
not
eat
of
it
no
not
if
i
had
to
starve
and
the
rav
knew
about
everything
about
going
on
a
journey
about
business
about
marrying
about
purifying
vessels
for
passover
another
great
teacher
was
the
dayyan
who
heard
people
quarrels
and
settled
them
according
to
the
law
so
that
they
should
not
have
to
go
to
the
gentile
courts
the
gentiles
were
false
judges
and
witnesses
and
all
they
favored
the
rich
man
against
the
poor
the
christian
against
the
jew
the
dayyan
always
gave
true
judgments
nohem
rabinovitch
the
richest
man
in
polotzk
could
not
win
a
case
against
a
servant
maid
unless
he
were
in
the
right
besides
the
rav
and
the
dayyan
there
were
other
men
whose
callings
were
holy
the
shohat
who
knew
how
cattle
and
fowls
should
be
killed
the
hazzan
and
the
other
officers
of
the
synagogue
the
teachers
of
hebrew
and
their
pupils
it
did
not
matter
how
poor
a
man
was
he
was
to
be
respected
and
set
above
other
men
if
he
were
learned
in
the
law
in
the
synagogue
scores
of
men
sat
all
day
long
over
the
hebrew
books
studying
and
disputing
from
early
dawn
till
candles
were
brought
in
at
night
and
then
as
long
as
the
candles
lasted
they
could
not
take
time
for
anything
else
if
they
meant
to
become
great
scholars
most
of
them
were
strangers
in
polotzk
and
had
no
home
except
the
synagogue
they
slept
on
benches
on
tables
on
the
floor
they
picked
up
their
meals
wherever
they
could
they
had
come
from
distant
cities
so
as
to
be
under
good
teachers
in
polotzk
and
the
townspeople
were
proud
to
support
them
by
giving
them
food
and
clothing
and
sometimes
money
to
visit
their
homes
on
holidays
but
the
poor
students
came
in
such
numbers
that
there
were
not
enough
rich
families
to
provide
for
all
so
that
some
of
them
suffered
privation
you
could
pick
out
a
poor
student
in
a
crowd
by
his
pale
face
and
shrunken
form
there
was
almost
always
a
poor
student
taking
meals
at
our
house
he
was
assigned
a
certain
day
and
on
that
day
my
grandmother
took
care
to
have
something
especially
good
for
dinner
it
was
a
very
shabby
guest
who
sat
down
with
us
at
table
but
we
children
watched
him
with
respectful
eyes
grandmother
had
told
us
that
he
was
a
lamden
scholar
and
we
saw
something
holy
in
the
way
he
ate
his
cabbage
not
every
man
could
hope
to
be
a
rav
but
no
jewish
boy
was
allowed
to
grow
up
without
at
least
a
rudimentary
knowledge
of
hebrew
the
scantiest
income
had
to
be
divided
so
as
to
provide
for
the
tuition
to
leave
a
boy
without
a
teacher
was
a
disgrace
upon
the
whole
family
to
the
remotest
relative
for
the
children
of
the
destitute
there
was
a
free
school
supported
by
the
charity
of
the
pious
and
so
every
boy
was
sent
to
heder
hebrew
school
almost
as
soon
as
he
could
speak
and
usually
he
continued
to
study
until
his
confirmation
at
thirteen
years
of
age
or
as
much
longer
as
his
talent
and
ambition
carried
him
my
brother
was
five
years
old
when
he
entered
on
his
studies
he
was
carried
to
the
heder
on
the
first
day
covered
over
with
a
so
that
nothing
unholy
should
look
on
him
and
he
was
presented
with
a
bun
on
which
were
traced
in
honey
these
words
the
torah
left
by
moses
is
the
heritage
of
the
children
of
jacob
after
a
boy
entered
heder
he
was
the
hero
of
the
family
he
was
served
before
the
other
children
at
table
and
nothing
was
too
good
for
him
if
the
family
were
very
poor
all
the
girls
might
go
barefoot
but
the
heder
boy
must
have
shoes
he
must
have
a
plate
of
hot
soup
though
the
others
ate
dry
bread
when
the
rebbe
teacher
came
on
sabbath
afternoon
to
examine
the
boy
in
the
hearing
of
the
family
everybody
sat
around
the
table
and
nodded
with
satisfaction
if
he
read
his
portion
well
and
he
was
given
a
great
saucerful
of
preserves
and
was
praised
and
blessed
and
made
much
of
no
wonder
he
said
in
his
morning
prayer
i
thank
thee
lord
for
not
having
created
me
a
female
it
was
not
much
to
be
a
girl
you
see
girls
could
not
be
scholars
and
rabbonim
i
went
to
my
brother
heder
sometimes
to
bring
him
his
dinner
and
saw
how
the
boys
studied
they
sat
on
benches
around
the
table
with
their
hats
on
of
course
and
the
sacred
fringes
hanging
beneath
their
jackets
the
rebbe
sat
at
an
end
of
the
table
rehearsing
two
or
three
of
the
boys
who
were
studying
the
same
part
pointing
out
the
words
with
his
wooden
pointer
so
as
not
to
lose
the
place
everybody
read
aloud
the
smallest
boys
repeating
the
alphabet
in
a
while
the
advanced
boys
read
their
portions
in
a
different
and
everybody
raised
his
voice
to
its
loudest
so
as
to
drown
the
other
voices
the
good
boys
never
took
their
eyes
off
their
page
except
to
ask
the
rebbe
a
question
but
the
naughty
boys
stared
around
the
room
and
kicked
each
other
under
the
table
till
the
rebbe
caught
them
at
it
he
had
a
ruler
for
striking
the
bad
boys
on
the
knuckles
and
in
a
corner
of
the
room
leaned
a
long
birch
wand
for
pupils
who
would
not
learn
their
lessons
the
boys
came
to
heder
before
nine
in
the
morning
and
remained
until
eight
or
nine
in
the
evening
stupid
pupils
who
could
not
remember
the
lesson
sometimes
had
to
stay
till
ten
there
was
an
hour
for
dinner
and
play
at
noon
good
little
boys
played
quietly
in
their
places
but
most
of
the
boys
ran
out
of
the
house
and
jumped
and
yelled
and
quarrelled
there
was
nothing
in
what
the
boys
did
in
heder
that
i
could
not
have
done
if
i
had
not
been
a
girl
for
a
girl
it
was
enough
if
she
could
read
her
prayers
in
hebrew
and
follow
the
meaning
by
the
yiddish
translation
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
it
did
not
take
long
to
learn
this
much
a
couple
of
terms
with
a
rebbetzin

teacher
and
after
that
she
was
done
with
books
a

there
she
learned
to
bake
and
cook
and
manage
to
knit
sew
and
embroider
also
to
spin
and
weave
in
country
places
and
while
her
hands
were
busy
her
mother
instructed
her
in
the
laws
regulating
a
pious
jewish
household
and
in
the
conduct
proper
for
a
jewish

for
of
course
every

hoped
to
be
a
wife
a
girl
was
born
for
no
other
purpose
how
soon
it
came
the
pious
burden
of
wifehood
one
day
the
girl
is
playing
forfeits
with
her
laughing
friends
the
next
day
she
is
missed
from
the
circle
she
has
been
summoned
to
a
conference
with
the

broker
who
has
been
for
months
past
advertising
her
housewifely
talents
her
piety
her
good
looks
and
her

portion
among
families
with
marriageable
sons
her
parents
are
pleased
with
the
proposed
by
the

and
now
at
the
last
the
girl
is
brought
in
to
be
examined
and
appraised
by
the
prospective
if
the
negotiations
go
off
smoothly
the
marriage
contract
is
written
presents
are
exchanged
between
the
engaged

through
their
respective

and
all
that
is
left
the

of
her
maidenhood
is
a
period
of
busy
preparation
for
the

illustration
heder
hebrew
school
for
boys
in
polotzk
if
the
girl
is
it
is
a
happy
interval
spent
in
visits
to
the
drapers
and
tailors
in
collecting
linens
and
featherbeds
and
vessels
of
copper
and
brass
the
former

come
to

of

the
happy
heroine
tries
on

and
mantles
before
her
glass
blushing
at
references
to
the
wedding
day
and
to
the
question
how
do
you
like
the
bridegroom
she
replies
how
should
i
know
there
was
such
a
crowd
at
the
betrothal
that
i
did
see
him
marriage
was
a
sacrament
with
us
jews
in
the
pale
to
rear
a
family
of
children
was
to
serve
god
every
jewish
man
and
woman
had
a
part
in
the
fulfilment
of
the
ancient
promise
given
to
jacob
that
his
seed
should
be
abundantly
scattered
over
the
earth
parenthood
therefore
was
the
great
career
but
while
men
in
addition
to
begetting
might
busy
themselves
with
the
study
of
the
law
woman
only
work
was
motherhood
to
be
left
an
old
maid
became
accordingly
the
greatest
misfortune
that
could
threaten
a
girl
and
to
ward
off
that
calamity
the
girl
and
her
family
to
the
most
distant
relatives
would
strain
every
nerve
whether
by
contributing
to
her
dowry
or
hiding
her
defects
from
the
marriage
broker
or
praying
and
fasting
that
god
might
send
her
a
husband
not
only
must
all
the
children
of
a
family
be
mated
but
they
must
marry
in
the
order
of
their
ages
a
younger
daughter
must
on
no
account
marry
before
an
elder
a
houseful
of
daughters
might
be
held
up
because
the
eldest
failed
to
find
favor
in
the
eyes
of
prospective
not
one
of
the
others
could
marry
till
the
eldest
was
disposed
of
a
cousin
of
mine
was
guilty
of
the
disloyalty
of
wishing
to
marry
before
her
elder
sister
who
was
unfortunate
enough
to
be
rejected
by
one
after
another
my
uncle
feared
that
the
younger
daughter
who
was
of
a
firm
and
masterful
nature
might
carry
out
her
plans
thereby
disgracing
her
unhappy
sister
accordingly
he
hastened
to
conclude
an
alliance
with
a
family
far
beneath
him
and
the
girl
was
hastily
married
to
a
boy
of
whom
little
was
known
beyond
the
fact
that
he
was
inclined
to
consumption
the
consumptive
tendency
was
no
such
horror
in
an
age
when
superstition
was
more
in
vogue
than
science
for
one
patient
that
went
to
a
physician
in
polotzk
there
were
ten
who
called
in
unlicensed
practitioners
and
miracle
workers
if
my
mother
had
an
obstinate
toothache
that
honored
household
remedies
failed
to
relieve
she
went
to
dvoshe
the
pious
woman
who
cured
by
means
of
a
flint
and
steel
and
a
secret
prayer
pronounced
as
the
sparks
flew
up
during
an
epidemic
of
scarlet
fever
we
protected
ourselves
by
wearing
a
piece
of
red
woolen
tape
around
the
neck
pepper
and
salt
tied
in
a
corner
of
the
pocket
was
effective
in
warding
off
the
evil
eye
there
were
lucky
signs
lucky
dreams
spirits
and
hobgoblins
a
grisly
collection
gathered
by
our
wandering
ancestors
from
the
demonologies
of
asia
and
europe
antiquated
as
our
popular
follies
was
the
organization
of
our
small
society
it
was
a
caste
system
with
social
levels
sharply
marked
off
and
families
united
by
clannish
ties
the
rich
looked
down
on
the
poor
the
merchants
looked
down
on
the
artisans
and
within
the
ranks
of
the
artisans
higher
and
lower
grades
were
distinguished
a
shoemaker
daughter
could
not
hope
to
marry
the
son
of
a
shopkeeper
unless
she
brought
an
extra
large
dowry
and
she
had
to
make
up
her
mind
to
be
snubbed
by
the
and
all
her
life
one
qualification
only
could
raise
a
man
above
his
social
level
and
that
was
scholarship
a
boy
born
in
the
gutter
need
not
despair
of
entering
the
houses
of
the
rich
if
he
had
a
good
mind
and
a
great
appetite
for
sacred
learning
a
poor
scholar
would
be
preferred
in
the
marriage
market
to
a
rich
ignoramus
in
the
phrase
of
our
grandmothers
a
boy
stuffed
with
learning
was
worth
more
than
a
girl
stuffed
with
bank
notes
simple
piety
unsupported
by
learning
had
a
parallel
value
in
the
eyes
of
good
families
this
was
especially
true
among
the
hasidim
the
sect
of
enthusiasts
who
set
religious
exaltation
above
rabbinical
lore
ecstasy
in
prayer
and
fantastic
merriment
on
days
of
religious
rejoicing
raised
a
hasid
to
a
hero
among
his
kind
my
grandfather
who
knew
of
hebrew
only
enough
to
teach
beginners
was
famous
through
a
good
part
of
the
pale
for
his
holy
life
israel
kimanyer
he
was
called
from
the
village
of
kimanye
where
he
lived
and
people
were
proud
to
establish
even
the
most
distant
relationship
with
him
israel
was
poor
to
the
verge
of
beggary
but
he
prayed
more
than
other
people
never
failed
in
the
slightest
observance
enjoined
on
jews
shared
his
last
crust
with
every
chance
beggar
and
sat
up
nights
to
commune
with
god
his
family
connections
included
country
peddlers
starving
artisans
and
but
israel
was
a
zaddik
a
man
of
piety
and
the
fame
of
his
good
life
redeemed
the
whole
wretched
clan
when
his
grandson
my
father
came
to
marry
he
boasted
his
direct
descent
from
israel
kimanyer
and
picked
his
bride
from
the
best
families
the
little
house
may
still
be
standing
which
the
pious
jews
of
kimanye
and
the
neighboring
villages
built
for
my
close
on
a
century
ago
he
was
too
poor
to
build
his
own
house
so
the
good
people
who
loved
him
and
who
were
almost
as
poor
as
he
collected
a
few
rubles
among
themselves
and
bought
a
site
and
built
the
house
built
let
it
be
known
with
their
own
hands
for
they
were
too
poor
to
hire
workmen
they
carried
the
beams
and
boards
on
their
shoulders
singing
and
dancing
on
the
way
as
they
sang
and
danced
at
the
presentation
of
a
scroll
to
the
synagogue
they
hauled
and
sawed
and
hammered
till
the
last
nail
was
driven
home
and
when
they
conducted
the
holy
man
to
his
new
abode
the
rejoicing
was
greater
than
at
the
crowning
of
a
czar
that
little
cabin
was
fit
to
be
preserved
as
the
monument
to
a
species
of
idealism
that
has
rarely
been
known
outside
the
pale
what
was
the
ultimate
source
of
the
pious
enthusiasm
that
built
my
house
what
was
the
substance
behind
the
show
of
the
judaism
of
the
pale
stripped
of
its
grotesque
mask
of
forms
rites
and
mediæval
superstitions
the
religion
of
these
fanatics
was
simply
the
belief
that
god
was
had
been
and
ever
would
be
and
that
they
the
children
of
jacob
were
his
chosen
messengers
to
carry
his
law
to
all
the
nations
beneath
the
mountainous
volumes
of
the
talmudists
and
commentators
the
mosaic
tablets
remained
intact
out
of
the
mazes
of
the
cabala
the
pure
doctrine
of
ancient
judaism
found
its
way
to
the
hearts
of
the
faithful
sects
and
schools
might
rise
and
fall
deafening
the
ears
of
the
simple
with
the
clamor
of
their
disputes
still
the
jew
retiring
within
his
own
soul
heard
the
voice
of
the
god
of
abraham
prophets
messiahs
miracle
workers
might
have
their
day
still
the
jew
was
conscious
that
between
himself
and
god
no
was
needed
that
he
as
well
as
every
one
of
his
million
brothers
had
his
portion
of
god
work
to
do
and
this
close
relation
to
god
was
the
source
of
the
strength
that
sustained
the
jew
through
all
the
trials
of
his
life
in
the
pale
consciously
or
unconsciously
the
jew
identified
himself
with
the
cause
of
righteousness
on
earth
and
hence
the
heroism
with
which
he
met
the
battalions
of
tyrants
no
empty
forms
could
have
impressed
the
unborn
children
of
the
pale
so
deeply
that
they
were
prepared
for
willing
martyrdom
almost
as
soon
as
they
were
weaned
from
their
mother
breast
the
flame
of
the
burning
bush
that
had
dazzled
moses
still
lighted
the
gloomy
prison
of
the
pale
behind
the
mummeries
ceremonials
and
symbolic
accessories
the
object
of
the
jew
adoration
was
the
face
of
god
this
has
been
many
times
proved
by
those
who
escaped
from
the
pale
and
excited
by
sudden
freedom
thought
to
rid
themselves
by
one
impatient
effort
of
every
strand
of
their
ancient
bonds
eager
to
be
merged
in
the
better
world
in
which
they
found
themselves
the
escaped
prisoners
determined
on
a
change
of
mind
a
change
of
heart
a
change
of
manner
they
rejoiced
in
their
transformation
thinking
that
every
mark
of
their
former
slavery
was
obliterated
and
then
one
day
caught
in
the
vise
of
some
crucial
test
the
jew
fixed
his
alarmed
gaze
on
his
inmost
soul
and
found
there
the
image
of
his
god
merrily
played
the
fiddlers
at
the
wedding
of
my
father
who
was
the
grandson
of
israel
kimanyer
of
sainted
memory
the
most
pious
men
in
polotzk
danced
the
night
through
their
earlocks
dangling
the
tails
of
their
long
coats
flying
in
a
pious
ecstasy
beggars
swarmed
among
the
bidden
guests
sure
of
an
easy
harvest
where
so
many
hearts
were
melted
by
piety
the
wedding
jester
excelled
himself
in
apt
allusions
to
the
friends
and
relatives
who
brought
up
their
wedding
presents
at
his
merry
invitation
the
bride
suffocated
beneath
her
heavy
veil
blushed
unseen
at
the
numerous
healths
drunk
to
her
future
sons
and
daughters
the
whole
town
was
with
joy
because
the
pious
scion
of
a
godly
race
had
found
a
pious
wife
and
a
young
branch
of
the
tree
of
judah
was
about
to
bear
fruit
when
i
came
to
lie
on
my
mother
breast
she
sang
me
lullabies
on
lofty
themes
i
heard
the
names
of
rebecca
rachel
and
leah
as
early
as
the
names
of
father
mother
and
nurse
my
baby
soul
was
enthralled
by
sad
and
noble
cadences
as
my
mother
sang
of
my
ancient
home
in
palestine
or
mourned
over
the
desolation
of
zion
with
the
first
rattle
that
was
placed
in
my
hand
a
prayer
was
pronounced
over
me
a
petition
that
a
pious
man
might
take
me
to
wife
and
a
messiah
be
among
my
sons
i
was
fed
on
dreams
instructed
by
means
of
prophecies
trained
to
hear
and
see
mystical
things
that
callous
senses
could
not
perceive
i
was
taught
to
call
myself
a
princess
in
memory
of
my
forefathers
who
had
ruled
a
nation
though
i
went
in
the
disguise
of
an
outcast
i
felt
a
halo
resting
on
my
brow
sat
upon
by
brutal
enemies
unjustly
hated
annihilated
a
hundred
times
i
yet
arose
and
held
my
head
high
sure
that
i
should
find
my
kingdom
in
the
end
although
i
had
lost
my
way
in
exile
for
he
who
had
brought
my
ancestors
safe
through
a
thousand
perils
was
guiding
my
feet
as
well
god
needed
me
and
i
needed
him
for
we
two
together
had
a
work
to
do
according
to
an
ancient
covenant
between
him
and
my
forefathers
this
is
the
dream
to
which
i
was
heir
in
common
with
every
child
of
the
pale
this
is
the
living
seed
which
i
found
among
my
heirlooms
when
i
learned
how
to
strip
from
them
the
prickly
husk
in
which
they
were
passed
down
to
me
and
what
is
the
fruit
of
such
seed
as
that
and
whither
lead
such
dreams
if
it
is
mine
to
give
the
answer

my
words

both
their
houses
among
the
mediæval
customs
which
were
preserved
in
the
pale
when
the
rest
of
the
world
had
long
forgotten
them
was
the
use
of
popular
sobriquets
in
place
of
surnames
proper
family
names
existed
only
in
official
documents
such
as
passports
for
the
most

people
were

by
nicknames
prosaic
or
picturesque
derived
from
their
occupations
their
physical
peculiarities
or
distinctive
achievements
among
my
neighbors
in
polotzk
were
yankel
the

the

the
and

of

by

may

let
me
hunt
for
my
name
in
the
chronicles
of
the
pale
in
the
village
of
yuchovitch
about
sixty
versts
above
polotzk
the
oldest
inhabitant
still
remembered
my
father
when
my
father
was
a
boy
lebe
the
innkeeper
he
was
called
and
no
reproach
was
coupled
with
the
name
his
son
hayyim
succeeded
to
the
business
but
later
he
took
up
the
glazier
trade
and
developed
a
knack
for
all
sorts
of
tinkering
whereby
he
was
able
to
increase
his
too
scanty
earnings
hayyim
the
glazier
is
reputed
to
have
been
a
man
of
fine
countenance
wise
in
homely
counsel
honest
in
all
his
dealings
rachel
leah
his
wife
had
a
reputation
for
practical
wisdom
even
greater
than
his
she
was
the
advice
giver
of
the
village
in
every
perplexity
of
life
my
father
remembers
his
grandmother
as
a
tall
trim
handsome
old
woman
active
and
independent
satin
headbands
and
bonnets
not
having
been
invented
in
her
day
rachel
leah
wore
the
stately
knupf
or
turban
on
her
shaven
head
on
sabbaths
and
holidays
she
went
to
the
synagogue
with
a
long
straight
mantle
hanging
from
neck
to
ankle
and
she
wore
it
with
an
air
on
one
sleeve
only
the
other
dangling
empty
from
her
shoulder
hayyim
begat
joseph
and
joseph
begat
pinchus
my
father
it
behooves
me
to
consider
the
stuff
i
sprang
from
joseph
inherited
the
trade
good
name
and
meagre
portion
of
his
father
and
maintained
the
family
tradition
of
honesty
and
poverty
unbroken
to
the
day
of
his
death
for
that
matter
yuchovitch
never
heard
of
any
connection
of
the
family
not
even
a
doubtful
cousin
who
was
not
steeped
to
the
earlocks
in
poverty
but
that
was
no
distinction
in
yuchovitch
the
whole
village
was
poor
almost
to
beggary
joseph
was
an
indifferent
workman
an
indifferent
scholar
and
an
indifferent
hasid
at
one
thing
only
he
was
strikingly
good
and
that
was
at
grumbling
although
not
unkind
he
had
a
temper
that
boiled
over
at
small
provocation
and
even
in
his
most
placid
mood
he
took
very
little
satisfaction
in
the
world
he
reversed
the
proverb
looking
for
the
sable
lining
of
every
silver
cloud
in
the
conditions
of
his
life
he
found
plenty
of
food
for
his
pessimism
and
merry
hearts
were
very
rare
among
his
neighbors
still
a
certain
amount
of
gloom
appears
to
have
been
inherent
in
the
man
and
as
he
distrusted
the
whole
world
so
joseph
distrusted
himself
which
made
him
shy
and
awkward
in
company
my
mother
tells
how
at
the
wedding
of
his
only
son
my
father
joseph
sat
the
whole
night
through
in
a
corner
never
as
much
as
cracking
a
smile
while
the
wedding
guests
danced
laughed
and
rejoiced
it
may
have
been
through
distrust
of
the
marital
state
that
joseph
remained
single
till
the
advanced
age
of
then
he
took
unto
himself
an
orphan
girl
as
poor
as
he
namely
rachel
the
daughter
of
israel
kimanyer
of
pious
memory
my
grandmother
was
such
a
gentle
cheerful
soul
when
i
knew
her
that
i
imagine
she
must
have
been
a
merry
bride
i
should
think
my
grandfather
would
have
taken
great
satisfaction
in
her
society
as
her
attempts
to
show
him
the
world
through
spectacles
would
have
given
him
frequent
opportunity
to
parade
his
grievances
and
recite
his
wrongs
but
from
all
reports
it
appears
that
he
was
never
satisfied
and
if
he
did
not
make
his
wife
unhappy
it
was
because
he
was
away
from
home
so
much
he
was
absent
the
greater
part
of
the
time
for
a
glazier
even
if
he
were
a
better
workman
than
my
grandfather
could
not
make
a
living
in
yuchovitch
he
became
a
country
peddler
trading
between
polotzk
and
yuchovitch
and
taking
in
all
the
desolate
little
hamlets
scattered
along
that
route
fifteen
rubles
worth
of
goods
was
a
big
bill
to
carry
out
of
polotzk
the
stock
consisted
of
cheap
pottery
tobacco
matches
boot
grease
and
axle
grease
these
he
bartered
for
country
produce
including
grains
in
small
quantity
bristles
rags
and
bones
money
was
seldom
handled
in
these
transactions
a
rough
enough
life
my
grandfather
led
on
the
road
at
all
seasons
in
all
weathers
knocking
about
at
smoky
little
inns
glad
sometimes
of
the
hospitality
of
some
peasant
hut
where
the
pigs
slept
with
the
family
he
was
doing
well
if
he
got
home
for
the
holidays
with
a
little
white
flour
for
a
cake
and
money
enough
to
take
his
best
coat
out
of
pawn
the
best
coat
and
the
candlesticks
too
would
be
repawned
promptly
on
the
first
workday
for
it
was
not
for
the
like
of
joseph
of
yuchovitch
to
live
with
idle
riches
around
him
for
the
credit
of
yuchovitch
it
must
be
recorded
that
my
grandfather
never
had
to
stay
away
from
the
synagogue
for
want
of
his
one
decent
coat
to
wear
his
neighbor
isaac
the
village
money
lender
never
refused
to
give
up
the
pledged
articles
on
a
sabbath
eve
even
if
the
money
due
was
not
forthcoming
many
sabbath
coats
besides
my
grandfather
and
many
candlesticks
besides
my
grandmother
passed
most
of
their
existence
under
isaac
roof
waiting
to
be
redeemed
but
on
the
eve
of
sabbath
or
holiday
isaac
delivered
them
to
their
respective
owners
came
they
or
otherwise
and
at
the
expiration
of
the
festival
the
grateful
owners
brought
them
promptly
back
for
another
season
of
retirement
while
my
grandfather
was
on
the
road
my
grandmother
conducted
her
humble
household
in
a
capable
housewifely
way
of
her
six
children
three
died
young
leaving
two
daughters
and
an
only
son
my
father
my
grandmother
fed
and
dressed
her
children
the
best
she
could
and
taught
them
to
thank
god
for
what
they
had
not
as
well
as
for
what
they
had
piety
was
about
the
only
positive
doctrine
she
attempted
to
drill
them
in
leaving
the
rest
of
their
education
to
life
and
the
rebbe
promptly
when
custom
prescribed
pinchus
the
petted
only
son
was
sent
to
heder
my
grandfather
being
on
the
road
at
the
time
my
grandmother
herself
carried
the
boy
in
her
arms
as
was
usual
on
the
first
day
my
father
distinctly
remembers
that
she
wept
on
the
way
to
the
heder
partly
i
suppose
from
joy
at
starting
her
son
on
a
holy
life
and
partly
from
sadness
at
being
too
poor
to
set
forth
the
wine
and
proper
to
the
occasion
for
grandma
rachel
schooled
though
she
was
to
pious
contentment
probably
had
her
moments
of
human
pettiness
like
the
rest
of
us
my
father
distinguished
himself
for
scholarship
from
the
first
five
years
old
when
he
entered
heder
at
eleven
he
was
already
a
a
student
in
the
seminary
the
rebbe
never
had
occasion
to
use
the
birch
on
him
on
the
contrary
he
held
him
up
as
an
example
to
the
dull
or
lazy
pupils
praised
him
in
the
village
and
carried
his
fame
to
polotzk
my
grandmother
cup
of
pious
joy
was
overfilled
everything
her
boy
did
was
pleasant
in
her
sight
for
pinchus
was
going
to
be
a
scholar
a
godly
man
a
credit
to
the
memory
of
his
renowned
grandfather
israel
kimanyer
she
let
nothing
interfere
with
his
schooling
when
times
were
bad
and
her
husband
came
home
with
his
goods
unsold
she
borrowed
and
begged
till
the
rebbe
fee
was
produced
if
bad
luck
continued
she
pleaded
with
the
rebbe
for
time
she
pawned
not
only
the
candlesticks
but
her
shawl
and
sabbath
cap
as
well
to
secure
the
scant
rations
that
gave
the
young
scholar
strength
to
study
more
than
once
in
the
bitter
winter
as
my
father
remembers
she
carried
him
to
heder
on
her
back
because
he
had
no
shoes
she
herself
walking
almost
barefoot
in
the
cruel
snow
no
sacrifice
was
too
great
for
her
in
the
pious
cause
of
her
boy
education
and
when
there
was
no
rebbe
in
yuchovitch
learned
enough
to
guide
him
in
the
advanced
studies
my
father
was
sent
to
polotzk
where
he
lived
with
his
poor
relations
who
were
not
too
poor
to
help
support
a
future
rebbe
or
rav
in
polotzk
he
continued
to
distinguish
himself
for
scholarship
till
people
began
to
prophesy
that
he
would
live
to
be
famous
and
everybody
who
remembered
israel
kimanyer
regarded
the
promising
grandson
with
double
respect
at
the
age
of
fifteen
my
father
was
qualified
to
teach
beginners
in
hebrew
and
he
was
engaged
as
instructor
in
two
families
living
six
versts
apart
in
the
country
the
boy
tutor
had
to
make
himself
useful
after
lesson
hours
by
caring
for
the
horse
hauling
water
from
the
frozen
pond
and
lending
a
hand
at
everything
when
the
little
sister
of
one
of
his
pupils
died
in
the
middle
of
the
winter
it
fell
to
my
father
lot
to
take
the
body
to
the
nearest
jewish
cemetery
through
miles
of
desolate
country
no
living
soul
accompanying
him
after
one
term
of
this
he
tried
to
go
on
with
his
own
studies
sometimes
in
yuchovitch
sometimes
in
polotzk
as
opportunity
dictated
he
made
the
journey
to
polotzk
beside
his
father
jogging
along
in
the
springless
wagon
on
the
rutty
roads
he
took
a
pleasure
in
the
gypsy
life
the
green
wood
and
the
summer
storm
while
his
father
sat
moody
beside
him
seeing
nothing
but
the
spavins
on
the
horse
hocks
and
the
mud
in
the
road
ahead
there
is
little
else
to
tell
of
my
father
boyhood
as
most
of
his
time
was
spent
in
the
schoolroom
outside
the
schoolroom
he
was
conspicuous
for
high
spirits
in
play
daring
in
mischief
and
independence
in
everything
but
a
boy
playtime
was
so
short
in
yuchovitch
and
his
resources
so
limited
that
even
a
lad
of
spirit
came
to
the
edge
of
his
premature
manhood
without
a
regret
for
his
nipped
youth
so
my
father
at
the
age
of
sixteen
and
a
half
lent
a
willing
ear
to
the
cooing
voice
of
the
marriage
broker
indeed
it
was
high
time
for
him
to
marry
his
parents
had
kept
him
so
far
but
they
had
two
daughters
to
marry
off
and
not
a
groschen
laid
by
for
their
dowries
the
cost
of
my
father
schooling
as
he
advanced
had
mounted
to
seventeen
rubles
a
term
and
the
poor
rebbe
was
seldom
paid
in
full
of
course
my
father
scholarship
was
his
fortune
in
time
it
would
be
his
support
but
in
the
meanwhile
the
burden
of
feeding
and
clothing
him
lay
heavy
on
his
shoulders
the
time
had
come
to
find
him
a
who
should
support
him
and
his
wife
and
children
while
he
continued
to
study
in
the
seminary
after
the
usual
conferences
between
parents
and
marriage
brokers
my
father
was
betrothed
to
an
undertaker
daughter
in
polotzk
the
girl
was
too
old
every
day
of
twenty
years
but
three
hundred
rubles
in
dowry
with
board
after
marriage
not
to
mention
handsome
presents
to
the
bridegroom
easily
offset
the
bride
age
my
father
family
to
the
humblest
cousin
felt
themselves
set
up
by
the
match
he
had
made
and
the
boy
was
happy
enough
displaying
a
watch
and
chain
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
and
a
good
coat
on
week
days
as
for
his
fiancée
he
could
have
no
objection
to
her
as
he
had
seen
her
only
at
a
distance
and
had
never
spoken
to
her
when
it
was
time
for
the
wedding
preparations
to
begin
news
came
to
yuchovitch
of
the
death
of
the
and
my
father
prospects
seemed
fallen
to
the
ground
but
the
undertaker
had
another
daughter
girl
of
thirteen
and
he
pressed
my
father
to
take
her
in
her
place
at
the
same
time
the
marriage
broker
proposed
another
match
and
my
father
poor
cousins
bristled
with
importance
once
more
somehow
or
other
my
father
succeeded
in
getting
in
a
word
at
the
family
councils
that
ensued
he
even
had
the
temerity
to
express
a
strong
preference
he
did
not
want
any
more
of
the
daughters
he
wanted
to
consider
the
rival
match
there
were
no
serious
objections
from
the
cousins
and
my
father
became
engaged
to
my
mother
this
second
choice
was
hannah
hayye
only
daughter
of
raphael
called
the
russian
she
had
had
a
very
different
from
pinchus
the
grandson
of
israel
kimanyer
she
had
never
known
a
day
of
want
had
never
gone
barefoot
from
necessity
the
family
had
a
solid
position
in
polotzk
her
father
being
the
owner
of
a
comfortable
home
and
a
good
business
prosperity
is
prosaic
so
i
shall
skip
briefly
over
the
history
of
my
mother
house
my
grandfather
raphael
early
left
an
orphan
was
brought
up
by
an
elder
brother
in
a
village
at
no
great
distance
from
polotzk
the
brother
dutifully
sent
him
to
heder
and
at
an
early
age
betrothed
him
to
deborah
daughter
of
one
solomon
a
dealer
in
grain
and
cattle
deborah
was
not
yet
in
her
teens
at
the
time
of
the
betrothal
and
so
foolish
was
she
that
she
was
afraid
of
her
affianced
husband
one
day
when
she
was
coming
from
the
store
with
a
bottle
of
liquid
yeast
she
suddenly
came
face
to
face
with
her
betrothed
which
gave
her
such
a
fright
that
she
dropped
the
bottle
spilling
the
yeast
on
her
pretty
dress
and
she
ran
home
crying
all
the
way
at
thirteen
she
was
married
which
had
a
good
effect
on
her
deportment
i
hear
no
more
of
her
running
away
from
her
husband
among
the
interesting
things
belonging
to
my
grandmother
besides
her
dowry
at
the
time
of
the
marriage
was
her
family
her
father
was
so
original
that
he
kept
a
tutor
for
his
daughters
sons
he
had
none
and
allowed
them
to
be
instructed
in
the
rudiments
of
three
or
four
languages
and
the
elements
of
arithmetic
even
more
unconventional
was
her
sister
hode
she
had
married
a
fiddler
who
travelled
constantly
playing
at
hotels
and
inns
all
through
far
russia
having
no
children
she
ought
to
have
spent
her
days
in
fasting
and
praying
and
lamenting
instead
of
this
she
accompanied
her
husband
on
his
travels
and
even
had
a
heart
to
enjoy
the
excitement
and
variety
of
their
restless
life
i
should
be
the
last
to
blame
my
for
the
irregularity
of
her
conduct
afforded
my
grandfather
the
opening
for
his
career
the
fruits
of
which
made
my
childhood
so
pleasant
for
several
years
my
grandfather
travelled
in
hode
train
in
the
capacity
of
shohat
providing
kosher
meat
for
the
little
troup
in
the
unholy
wilds
of
far
russia
and
the
grateful
couple
rewarded
him
so
generously
that
he
soon
had
a
fortune
of
eighty
rubles
laid
by
my
grandfather
thought
the
time
had
now
come
to
settle
down
but
he
did
not
know
how
to
invest
his
wealth
to
resolve
his
perplexity
he
made
a
pilgrimage
to
the
rebbe
of
kopistch
who
advised
him
to
open
a
store
in
polotzk
and
gave
him
a
blessed
groschen
to
keep
in
the
money
drawer
for
good
luck
the
blessing
of
the
good
jew
proved
fruitful
my
business
prospered
and
my
grandmother
bore
him
children
several
sons
and
one
daughter
the
sons
were
sent
to
heder
like
all
respectable
boys
and
they
were
taught
in
addition
writing
and
arithmetic
enough
for
conducting
a
business
with
this
my
grandfather
was
content
more
than
this
he
considered
incompatible
with
piety
he
was
one
of
those
who
strenuously
opposed
the
influence
of
the
public
school
and
bribed
the
government
officials
to
keep
their
names
off
the
register
of
schoolboys
as
we
have
already
seen
when
he
sent
his
sons
to
a
private
tutor
where
they
could
study
russian
with
their
hats
on
he
felt
no
doubt
that
he
was
giving
them
all
the
education
necessary
to
a
successful
business
career
without
violating
piety
too
grossly
if
reading
and
writing
were
enough
for
the
sons
even
less
would
suffice
the
daughter
a
female
teacher
was
engaged
for
my
mother
at
three
kopecks
a
week
to
teach
her
the
hebrew
prayers
and
my
grandmother
herself
a
better
scholar
than
the
teacher
taught
her
writing
in
addition
my
mother
was
quick
to
learn
and
expressed
an
ambition
to
study
russian
she
teased
and
coaxed
and
her
mother
pleaded
for
her
till
my
grandfather
was
persuaded
to
send
her
to
a
tutor
but
the
fates
were
opposed
to
my
mother
education
on
the
first
day
at
school
a
sudden
inflammation
of
the
eyes
blinded
my
mother
temporarily
and
although
the
distemper
vanished
as
suddenly
as
it
had
appeared
it
was
taken
as
an
omen
and
my
mother
was
not
allowed
to
return
to
her
lessons
still
she
did
not
give
up
she
saved
up
every
groschen
that
was
given
her
to
buy
sweets
and
bribed
her
brother
solomon
who
was
proud
of
his
scholarship
to
give
her
lessons
in
secret
the
two
strove
earnestly
with
book
and
quill
in
their
under
the
rafters
till
my
mother
could
read
and
write
russian
and
translate
a
simple
passage
of
hebrew
my
grandmother
although
herself
a
good
housewife
took
no
pains
to
teach
her
only
daughter
the
domestic
arts
she
only
petted
and
coddled
her
and
sent
her
out
to
play
but
my
mother
was
as
ambitious
about
housework
as
about
books
she
coaxed
the
housemaid
to
let
her
mix
the
bread
she
learned
knitting
from
watching
her
playmates
she
was
healthy
and
active
quick
at
everything
and
restless
with
unspent
energy
therefore
she
was
quite
willing
at
the
age
of
ten
to
go
into
her
father
business
as
his
chief
assistant
as
the
years
went
by
she
developed
a
decided
talent
for
business
so
that
her
father
could
safely
leave
all
his
affairs
in
her
hands
if
he
had
to
go
out
of
town
her
devotion
ability
and
tireless
energy
made
her
in
time
indispensable
my
grandfather
was
obliged
to
admit
that
the
little
learning
she
had
stolen
was
turned
to
good
account
when
he
saw
how
well
she
could
keep
his
books
and
how
smoothly
she
got
along
with
russian
and
polish
customers
perhaps
that
was
the
argument
that
induced
him
after
obstinate
years
to
remove
his
veto
from
my
mother
petitions
and
let
her
take
up
lessons
again
for
while
piety
was
my
grandfather
chief
concern
on
the
godly
side
on
the
worldly
side
he
set
success
in
business
above
everything
my
mother
was
fifteen
years
old
when
she
entered
on
a
career
of
higher
education
for
two
hours
daily
she
was
released
from
the
store
and
in
that
interval
she
strove
with
might
and
main
to
conquer
the
world
of
knowledge
katrina
petrovna
her
teacher
praised
and
encouraged
her
and
there
was
no
reason
why
the
promising
pupil
should
not
have
developed
into
a
young
lady
of
culture
with
madame
teaching
russian
german
crocheting
and
singing
yes
out
of
a
book
to
the
accompaniment
of
a
clavier
all
for
a
fee
of
kopecks
a
week
illustration
the
wood
market
polotzk
did
i
say
there
was
no
reason
and
what
about
the
marriage
broker
hannah
hayye
the
only
daughter
of
raphael
the
russian
going
on
sixteen
buxom
bright
capable
and
well
educated
could
not
escape
the
eye
of
the
shadchan
a
fine
thing
it
would
be
to
let
such
a
likely
girl
grow
old
over
a
book
to
the
canopy
with
her
while
she
could
fetch
the
highest
price
in
the
marriage
market
my
mother
was
very
unwilling
to
think
of
marriage
at
this
time
she
had
nothing
to
gain
by
marriage
for
already
she
had
everything
that
she
desired
especially
since
she
was
permitted
to
study
while
her
father
was
rather
stern
her
mother
spoiled
and
petted
her
and
she
was
the
idol
of
her
aunt
hode
the
fiddler
wife
hode
had
bought
a
fine
estate
in
polotzk
after
my
grandfather
settled
there
and
made
it
her
home
whenever
she
became
tired
of
travelling
she
lived
in
state
with
many
servants
and
dependents
wearing
silk
dresses
on
week
days
and
setting
silver
plate
before
the
meanest
guest
the
women
of
polotzk
were
breathless
over
her
wardrobe
counting
up
how
many
pairs
of
embroidered
boots
she
had
at
fifteen
rubles
a
pair
and
hode
manners
were
as
much
a
subject
of
gossip
as
her
clothes
for
she
had
picked
up
strange
ways
in
her
travels
although
she
was
so
pious
that
she
was
never
tempted
to
eat
trefah
no
matter
if
she
had
to
go
hungry
her
conduct
in
other
respects
was
not
strictly
orthodox
for
one
thing
she
was
in
the
habit
of
shaking
hands
with
men
looking
them
straight
in
the
face
she
spoke
russian
like
a
gentile
she
kept
a
poodle
and
she
had
no
children
nobody
meant
to
blame
the
rich
woman
for
being
childless
because
it
was
well
known
in
polotzk
that
hode
the
russian
as
she
was
called
would
have
given
all
her
wealth
for
one
scrawny
baby
but
she
was
to
blame
for
voluntarily
exiling
herself
from
jewish
society
for
years
at
a
time
to
live
among
and
copy
the
bold
ways
of
gentile
women
and
so
while
they
pitied
her
childlessness
the
women
of
polotzk
regarded
her
misfortune
as
perhaps
no
more
than
a
due
punishment
hode
poor
woman
felt
a
hungry
heart
beneath
her
satin
robes
she
wanted
to
adopt
one
of
my
grandmother
children
but
my
grandmother
would
not
hear
of
it
hode
was
particularly
taken
with
my
mother
and
my
grandmother
in
compassion
loaned
her
the
child
for
days
at
a
time
and
those
were
happy
days
for
both
aunt
and
niece
hode
would
treat
my
mother
to
every
delicacy
in
her
sumptuous
pantry
tell
her
wonderful
tales
of
life
in
distant
parts
show
her
all
her
beautiful
dresses
and
jewels
and
load
her
with
presents
as
my
mother
developed
into
girlhood
her
aunt
grew
more
and
more
covetous
of
her
following
a
secret
plan
she
adopted
a
boy
from
the
poorhouse
and
brought
him
up
with
every
advantage
that
money
could
buy
my
mother
on
her
visits
was
thrown
a
great
deal
into
this
society
but
she
liked
him
less
than
the
poodle
this
grieved
her
aunt
who
cherished
in
her
heart
the
hope
that
my
mother
would
marry
her
adopted
son
and
so
become
her
daughter
after
all
and
in
order
to
accustom
her
to
think
well
of
the
match
hode
dinned
the
boy
name
in
my
mother
ears
day
and
night
praising
him
and
showing
him
off
she
would
open
her
jewel
boxes
and
take
out
the
flashing
diamonds
heavy
chains
and
tinkling
bracelets
dress
my
mother
in
them
in
front
of
the
mirror
telling
her
that
they
would
all
be
hers
all
her
own
when
she
became
the
bride
of
mulke
my
mother
still
describes
the
necklace
of
pearls
and
diamonds
which
her
aunt
used
to
clasp
around
her
plump
throat
with
a
light
in
her
eyes
that
is
reminiscent
of
girlish
pleasure
but
to
all
her
teasing
references
to
the
future
my
mother
answered
with
a
giggle
and
a
shake
of
her
black
curls
and
went
on
enjoying
herself
thinking
that
the
day
of
judgment
was
very
very
far
away
but
it
swooped
down
on
her
sooner
than
she
expected
the
momentous
hour
when
she
must
choose
between
the
pearl
necklace
with
mulke
and
a
penniless
stranger
from
yuchovitch
who
was
reputed
to
be
a
fine
scholar
mulke
she
would
not
have
even
if
all
the
pearls
in
the
ocean
came
with
him
the
boy
was
stupid
and
unteachable
and
of
unspeakable
origin
picked
up
from
the
dirty
floor
of
the
poorhouse
his
father
was
identified
as
the
lazy
porter
who
sometimes
chopped
a
cord
of
wood
for
my
grandmother
and
his
sisters
were
slovenly
housemaids
scattered
through
polotzk
no
mulke
was
not
to
be
considered
but
why
consider
anybody
why
think
of
a
at
all
when
she
was
so
content
my
mother
ran
away
every
time
the
shadchan
came
and
she
begged
to
be
left
as
she
was
and
cried
and
invoked
her
mother
support
but
her
mother
for
the
first
time
in
her
history
refused
to
take
the
daughter
part
she
joined
the
enemy
the
family
and
the
shadchan
and
my
mother
saw
that
she
was
doomed
of
course
she
submitted
what
else
could
a
dutiful
daughter
do
in
polotzk
she
submitted
to
being
weighed
measured
and
appraised
before
her
face
and
resigned
herself
to
what
was
to
come
when
that
which
was
to
come
did
come
she
did
not
recognize
it
she
was
all
alone
in
the
store
one
day
when
a
beardless
young
man
in
top
boots
that
wanted
grease
and
a
coat
too
thin
for
the
weather
came
in
for
a
package
of
cigarettes
my
mother
climbed
up
on
the
counter
with
one
foot
on
a
shelf
to
reach
down
the
cigarettes
the
customer
gave
her
the
right
change
and
went
out
and
my
mother
never
suspected
that
that
was
the
proposed
hossen
who
came
to
look
her
over
and
see
if
she
was
likely
to
last
for
my
father
considered
himself
a
man
of
experience
now
this
being
his
second
match
and
he
was
determined
to
have
a
hand
in
this
affair
himself
no
sooner
was
the
hossen
out
of
the
store
than
his
mother
also
unknown
to
the
innocent
storekeeper
came
in
for
a
pound
of
tallow
candles
she
offered
a
torn
bill
in
payment
and
my
mother
accepted
it
and
gave
change
showing
that
she
was
wise
enough
in
money
matters
to
know
that
a
torn
bill
was
good
currency
after
the
woman
there
shuffled
in
a
poor
man
evidently
from
the
country
who
in
a
shy
and
yet
challenging
manner
asked
for
a
package
of
cheap
tobacco
my
mother
produced
the
goods
with
her
usual
dispatch
gave
the
correct
change
and
stood
at
attention
for
more
trade
parents
and
son
held
a
council
around
the
corner
the
object
of
their
espionage
never
dreaming
that
she
had
been
put
to
a
triple
test
and
not
found
wanting
but
in
the
evening
of
the
same
day
she
was
enlightened
she
was
summoned
to
her
elder
brother
house
for
a
conference
on
the
subject
of
the
proposed
match
and
there
she
found
the
young
man
who
had
bought
the
cigarettes
for
my
mother
family
if
they
forced
her
to
marry
were
willing
to
make
her
path
easier
by
letting
her
meet
the
hossen
convinced
that
she
must
be
won
over
by
his
good
looks
and
learned
conversation
it
does
not
really
matter
how
my
mother
felt
as
she
sat
with
a
protecting
niece
in
her
lap
at
one
end
of
a
long
table
with
the
hossen
fidgeting
at
the
other
end
the
marriage
contract
would
be
written
anyway
no
matter
what
she
thought
of
the
hossen
and
the
contract
was
duly
written
in
the
presence
of
the
assembled
families
of
both
parties
after
plenty
of
open
discussion
in
which
everybody
except
the
prospective
bride
and
groom
had
a
voice
one
voice
in
particular
broke
repeatedly
into
the
consultations
of
the
parents
and
the
shadchan
and
that
was
the
voice
of
henne
rösel
one
of
my
father
numerous
poor
cousins
henne
rösel
was
not
unknown
to
my
mother
she
often
came
to
the
store
to
beg
under
pretence
of
borrowing
a
little
flour
or
sugar
or
a
stick
of
cinnamon
on
the
occasion
of
the
betrothal
she
had
arrived
late
dressed
in
indescribable
odds
and
ends
with
an
artificial
red
flower
stuck
into
her
frowzy
wig
she
pushed
and
elbowed
her
way
to
the
middle
of
the
table
where
the
shadchan
sat
ready
with
paper
and
ink
to
take
down
the
articles
of
the
contract
on
every
point
she
had
some
comment
to
make
till
a
dispute
arose
over
a
note
which
my
grandfather
offered
as
part
of
the
dowry
the
hossen
people
insisting
on
cash
no
one
insisted
so
loudly
as
the
cousin
with
the
red
flower
in
her
wig
and
when
the
other
cousins
seemed
about
to
weaken
and
accept
the
note
stood
up
and
exhorted
them
to
be
firm
lest
their
flesh
and
blood
be
cheated
under
their
noses
the
meddlesome
cousin
was
silenced
at
last
the
contract
was
signed
the
happiness
of
the
engaged
couple
was
pledged
in
wine
the
guests
dispersed
and
all
this
while
my
mother
had
not
opened
her
mouth
and
my
father
had
scarcely
been
heard
that
is
the
way
my
fate
was
sealed
it
gives
me
a
shudder
of
wonder
to
think
what
a
narrow
escape
i
had
i
came
so
near
not
being
born
at
all
if
the
beggarly
cousin
with
the
frowzy
wig
had
prevailed
upon
her
family
and
broken
off
the
match
then
my
mother
would
not
have
married
my
father
and
i
should
at
this
moment
be
an
unborn
possibility
in
a
philosopher
brain
it
is
right
that
i
should
pick
my
words
most
carefully
and
meditate
over
every
comma
because
i
am
describing
miracles
too
great
for
careless
utterance
if
i
had
died
after
my
first
breath
my
history
would
still
be
worth
recording
for
before
i
could
lie
on
my
mother
breast
the
earth
had
to
be
prepared
and
the
stars
had
to
take
their
places
a
million
races
had
to
die
testing
the
laws
of
life
and
a
boy
and
girl
had
to
be
bound
for
life
to
watch
together
for
my
coming
i
was
millions
of
years
on
the
way
and
i
came
through
the
seas
of
chance
over
the
fiery
mountain
of
law
by
the
zigzag
path
of
human
possibility
multitudes
were
pushed
back
into
the
abyss
of
that
i
should
have
way
to
creep
into
being
and
at
the
last
when
i
stood
at
the
gate
of
life
a
fishwife
who
had
not
wit
enough
to
support
herself
came
near
shutting
me
out
such
creatures
of
accident
are
we
liable
to
a
thousand
deaths
before
we
are
born
but
once
we
are
here
we
may
create
our
own
world
if
we
choose
since
i
have
stood
on
my
own
feet
i
have
never
met
my
master
for
every
time
i
choose
a
friend
i
determine
my
fate
anew
i
can
think
of
no
cataclysm
that
could
have
the
force
to
move
me
from
my
path
fire
or
flood
or
the
envy
of
men
may
tear
the
roof
off
my
house
but
my
soul
would
still
be
at
home
under
the
lofty
mountain
pines
that
dip
their
heads
in
star
dust
even
life
that
was
so
difficult
to
attain
may
serve
me
merely
as
a
wayside
inn
if
i
choose
to
go
on
eternally
however
i
came
here
it
is
mine
to
be
chapter
iv
daily
bread
my
mother
ought
to
have
been
happy
in
her
engagement
everybody
congratulated
her
on
securing
such
a
scholar
her
parents
loaded
her
with
presents
and
her
friends
envied
her
it
is
true
that
the
hossen
family
consisted
entirely
of
poor
relations
there
was
not
one
solid
householder
among
them
from
the
worldly
point
of
view
my
mother
made
a
mésalliance
but
as
one
of
my
aunts
put
it
when
my
mother
objected
to
the
association
with
the
undesirable
cousins
she
could
take
out
the
cow
and
set
fire
to
the
barn
meaning
that
she
could
rejoice
in
the
hossen
and
disregard
his
family
the
hossen
on
his
part
had
reason
to
rejoice
without
any
reservations
he
was
going
into
a
highly
respectable
family
with
a
name
supported
by
property
and
business
standing
the
promised
dowry
was
considerable
the
presents
were
generous
the
trousseau
would
be
liberal
and
the
bride
was
fair
and
capable
the
bridegroom
would
have
years
before
him
in
which
he
need
do
nothing
but
eat
free
board
wear
his
new
clothes
and
study
torah
and
his
poor
relations
could
hold
up
their
heads
at
the
market
stalls
and
in
the
rear
pews
in
the
synagogue
my
mother
trousseau
was
all
that
a
could
wish
the
best
tailor
in
polotzk
was
engaged
to
make
the
cloaks
and
gowns
and
his
shop
was
filled
to
bursting
with
ample
lengths
of
velvet
and
satin
and
silk
the
wedding
gown
alone
cost
every
kopeck
of
fifty
rubles
as
the
tailor
wife
reported
all
over
polotzk
the
lingerie
was
of
the
best
and
the
seamstress
was
engaged
on
it
for
many
weeks
featherbeds
linen
household
goods
of
every
sort
everything
was
provided
in
abundance
my
mother
crocheted
many
yards
of
lace
to
trim
the
best
sheets
and
fine
silk
coverlets
adorned
the
plump
beds
many
a
marriageable
maiden
who
came
to
view
the
trousseau
went
home
to
prink
and
blush
and
watch
for
the
shadchan
the
wedding
was
memorable
for
gayety
and
splendor
the
guests
included
some
of
the
finest
people
in
polotzk
for
while
my
grandfather
was
not
quite
at
the
top
of
the
social
scale
he
had
business
connections
with
those
that
were
and
they
all
turned
out
for
the
wedding
of
his
only
daughter
the
men
in
silk
frock
coats
the
women
in
all
their
jewelry
the
bridegroom
aunts
and
cousins
came
in
full
force
wedding
messengers
had
been
sent
to
every
person
who
could
possibly
claim
relationship
with
the
hossen
my
mother
parents
were
too
generous
to
slight
the
lowliest
instead
of
burning
the
barn
they
did
all
they
could
to
garnish
it
one
or
two
of
the
more
important
of
the
poor
relations
came
to
the
wedding
in
gowns
paid
for
by
my
rich
grandfather
the
rest
came
decked
out
in
borrowed
finery
or
in
undisguised
shabbiness
but
nobody
thought
of
staying
away
except
the
obstructive
cousin
who
had
nearly
prevented
the
match
when
it
was
time
to
conduct
the
bride
to
the
wedding
canopy
the
bridegroom
mother
missed
henne
rösel
the
house
was
searched
for
her
but
in
vain
nobody
had
seen
her
but
my
grandmother
could
not
bear
to
have
the
marriage
solemnized
in
the
absence
of
a
first
cousin
such
a
wedding
as
this
was
not
likely
to
be
repeated
in
her
family
it
would
be
a
great
pity
if
any
of
the
relatives
missed
it
so
she
petitioned
the
principals
to
delay
the
ceremony
while
she
herself
went
in
search
of
the
missing
cousin
clear
over
to
the
farthest
end
of
the
town
she
walked
lifting
her
gala
dress
well
above
her
ankles
she
found
henne
rösel
in
her
untidy
kitchen
sound
in
every
limb
but
sulky
in
spirit
my
grandmother
exclaimed
at
her
conduct
and
bade
her
hurry
with
her
toilet
and
accompany
her
the
wedding
guests
were
waiting
the
bride
was
faint
from
prolonging
her
fast
but
henne
rösel
flatly
refused
to
go
the
bride
might
remain
an
old
maid
for
all
she
henne
rösel
cared
about
the
wedding
my
troubled
grandmother
expostulated
questioned
her
till
she
drew
out
the
root
of
the
cousin
sulkiness
henne
rösel
complained
that
she
had
not
been
properly
invited
the
wedding
messenger
had
come
oh
yes
but
she
had
not
addressed
her
as
flatteringly
as
respectfully
as
she
had
been
heard
to
address
the
wife
of
yohem
the
and
henne
rösel
was
going
to
any
weddings
where
she
was
not
wanted
my
grandmother
had
a
struggle
of
it
but
she
succeeded
in
soothing
the
sensitive
cousin
who
consented
at
length
to
don
her
best
dress
and
go
to
the
wedding
while
my
grandmother
labored
with
henne
rösel
the
bride
sat
in
state
in
her
father
house
under
the
hill
the
maidens
danced
and
the
matrons
fanned
themselves
while
the
fiddlers
and
scraped
and
tinkled
but
as
the
hours
went
by
the
matrons
became
restless
and
the
dancers
wearied
the
poor
relations
grew
impatient
for
the
feast
and
the
babies
in
their
laps
began
to
fidget
and
cry
while
the
bride
grew
faint
and
the
bridegroom
party
began
to
send
frequent
messengers
from
the
house
next
door
demanding
to
know
the
cause
of
the
delay
some
of
the
guests
at
last
lost
all
patience
and
begged
leave
to
go
home
but
before
they
went
they
deposited
the
wedding
presents
in
the
bride
satin
lap
till
she
resembled
a
heathen
image
hung
about
with
offerings
my
mother
after
thirty
years
of
bustling
life
retains
a
lively
memory
of
the
embarrassment
she
suffered
while
waiting
for
the
arrival
of
the
troublesome
cousin
when
that
important
dame
at
last
appeared
with
her
chin
in
the
air
the
artificial
flower
still
stuck
belligerently
into
her
dusty
wig
and
my
grandmother
beaming
behind
her
the
bride
heart
fairly
jumped
with
anger
and
the
red
blood
of
indignation
set
her
cheeks
afire
no
wonder
that
she
speaks
the
name
of
the
with
an
unloving
accent
to
this
day
although
she
has
forgiven
the
enemies
who
did
her
greater
wrong
the
bride
is
a
princess
on
her
wedding
day
to
put
upon
her
an
indignity
is
an
unpardonable
offense
after
the
feasting
and
dancing
which
lasted
a
whole
week
the
wedding
presents
were
locked
up
the
bride
with
her
hair
discreetly
covered
returned
to
her
father
store
and
the
groom
with
his
new
repaired
to
the
synagogue
this
was
all
according
to
the
marriage
bargain
which
implied
that
my
father
was
to
study
and
pray
and
fill
the
house
with
the
spirit
of
piety
in
return
for
board
and
lodging
and
the
devotion
of
his
wife
and
her
entire
family
all
the
parties
concerned
had
entered
into
this
bargain
in
good
faith
so
far
as
they
knew
their
own
minds
but
the
bridegroom
before
many
months
had
passed
began
to
realize
that
he
felt
no
such
hunger
for
the
word
of
the
law
as
he
was
supposed
to
feel
he
felt
rather
a
hunger
for
life
that
all
his
studying
did
not
satisfy
he
was
not
trained
enough
to
analyze
his
own
thoughts
to
any
purpose
he
was
not
experienced
enough
to
understand
where
his
thoughts
were
leading
him
he
only
knew
that
he
felt
no
call
to
pray
and
fast
that
the
torah
did
not
inspire
him
and
his
days
were
blank
the
life
he
was
expected
to
lead
grew
distasteful
to
him
and
yet
he
knew
no
other
way
to
live
he
became
lax
in
his
attendance
at
the
synagogue
incurring
the
reproach
of
the
family
it
began
to
be
rumored
among
the
studious
that
the
of
raphael
the
russian
was
not
devoting
himself
to
the
sacred
books
with
any
degree
of
enthusiasm
it
was
well
known
that
he
had
a
good
mind
but
evidently
the
spirit
was
lacking
my
grandparents
went
from
surprise
to
indignation
from
exhortation
they
passed
to
recrimination
before
my
parents
had
been
married
half
a
year
my
grandfather
house
was
divided
against
itself
and
my
mother
was
torn
between
the
two
factions
for
while
she
sympathized
with
her
parents
and
felt
personally
cheated
by
my
father
lack
of
piety
she
thought
it
was
her
duty
to
take
her
husband
part
even
against
her
parents
in
their
own
house
my
mother
was
one
of
those
women
who
always
obey
the
highest
law
they
know
even
though
it
leads
them
to
their
doom
how
did
it
happen
that
my
father
who
from
his
early
boyhood
had
been
pointed
out
as
a
scholar
in
embryo
failed
to
live
up
to
the
expectations
of
his
world
it
happened
as
it
happened
that
his
hair
curled
over
his
high
forehead
he
was
made
that
way
if
people
were
disappointed
it
was
because
they
had
based
their
expectations
on
a
misconception
of
his
character
for
my
father
had
never
had
any
aspirations
for
extreme
piety
piety
was
imputed
to
him
by
his
mother
by
his
rebbe
by
his
neighbors
when
they
saw
that
he
rendered
the
sacred
word
more
intelligently
than
his
fellow
students
it
was
not
his
fault
that
his
people
confused
scholarship
with
religious
ardor
having
a
good
mind
he
was
glad
to
exercise
it
and
being
given
only
one
subject
to
study
he
was
bound
to
make
rapid
progress
in
that
if
he
had
ever
been
offered
a
choice
between
a
religious
and
a
secular
education
his
friends
would
have
found
out
early
that
he
was
not
born
to
be
a
rav
but
as
he
had
no
mental
opening
except
through
the
hedder
he
went
on
from
year
to
year
winning
new
distinction
in
hebrew
scholarship
with
the
result
that
witnesses
with
preconceived
ideas
began
to
see
the
halo
of
piety
playing
around
his
head
and
a
family
was
misled
into
making
a
match
with
him
for
the
sake
of
the
glory
that
he
was
to
attain
when
it
became
evident
that
the
was
not
going
to
develop
into
a
rav
my
grandfather
notified
him
that
he
would
have
to
assume
the
support
of
his
own
family
without
delay
my
father
therefore
entered
on
a
series
of
experiments
with
paying
occupations
for
none
of
which
he
was
qualified
and
in
none
of
which
he
succeeded
permanently
my
mother
was
with
my
father
as
equal
partner
and
laborer
in
everything
he
attempted
in
polotzk
they
tried
keeping
a
wayside
inn
but
had
to
give
it
up
because
the
life
was
too
rough
for
my
mother
who
was
expecting
her
first
baby
returning
to
polotzk
they
went
to
storekeeping
on
their
own
account
but
failed
in
this
also
because
my
father
was
inexperienced
and
my
mother
now
with
the
baby
to
nurse
was
not
able
to
give
her
best
attention
to
business
over
two
years
passed
in
this
experiment
and
in
the
interval
the
second
child
was
born
increasing
my
parents
need
of
a
home
and
a
reliable
income
it
was
then
decided
that
my
father
should
seek
his
fortune
elsewhere
he
travelled
as
far
east
as
tchistopol
on
the
volga
and
south
as
far
as
odessa
on
the
black
sea
trying
his
luck
at
various
occupations
within
the
usual
jewish
restrictions
finally
he
reached
the
position
of
assistant
superintendent
in
a
distillery
with
a
salary
of
thirty
rubles
a
month
that
was
a
fair
income
for
those
days
and
he
was
planning
to
have
his
family
join
him
when
my
grandfather
raphael
died
leaving
my
mother
heir
to
a
good
business
my
father
thereupon
returned
to
polotzk
after
nearly
three
years
absence
from
home
as
my
mother
had
been
trained
to
her
business
from
childhood
while
my
father
had
had
only
a
little
irregular
experience
she
naturally
remained
the
leader
she
was
as
successful
as
her
father
before
her
the
people
continued
to
call
her
raphael
hannah
hayye
and
under
that
name
she
was
greatly
respected
in
the
business
world
her
eldest
brother
was
now
a
merchant
of
importance
and
my
establishment
was
gradually
enlarged
so
that
altogether
our
family
had
a
solid
position
in
polotzk
and
there
were
plenty
to
envy
us
we
were
almost
rich
as
polotzk
counted
riches
in
those
days
certainly
we
were
considered
we
moved
into
a
larger
house
where
there
was
room
for
customers
to
stay
overnight
with
stabling
for
their
horses
we
lived
as
well
as
any
people
of
our
class
and
perhaps
better
because
my
father
had
brought
home
with
him
from
his
travels
a
taste
for
a
more
genial
life
than
polotzk
usually
asked
for
my
mother
kept
a
cook
and
a
nursemaid
and
a
dvornik
or
outdoor
man
to
take
care
of
the
horses
the
cow
and
the
woodpile
all
the
year
round
we
kept
open
house
as
i
remember
cousins
and
aunts
were
always
about
and
on
holidays
friends
of
all
degrees
gathered
in
numbers
and
coming
and
going
in
the
wing
set
apart
for
business
guests
were
merchants
traders
country
peddlers
peasants
soldiers
and
minor
government
officials
it
was
a
full
house
at
all
times
and
especially
so
during
fairs
and
at
the
season
of
the
military
draft
in
the
family
wing
there
was
also
enough
going
on
there
were
four
of
us
children
besides
father
and
mother
and
grandmother
and
the
parasitic
cousins
fetchke
was
the
eldest
i
was
the
second
the
third
was
my
only
brother
named
joseph
for
my
father
father
and
the
fourth
was
deborah
named
for
my
mother
mother
i
suppose
i
ought
to
explain
my
own
name
also
especially
because
i
am
going
to
emerge
as
the
heroine
by
and
by
be
it
therefore
known
that
i
was
named
maryashe
for
a
bygone
aunt
i
was
never
called
by
my
full
name
however
maryashe
was
too
dignified
for
me
i
was
always
mashinke
or
else
mashke
by
way
of
diminutive
a
variety
of
nicknames
mostly
suggested
by
my
physical
peculiarities
were
bestowed
on
me
from
time
to
time
by
my
fond
or
foolish
relatives
my
uncle
berl
for
example
gave
me
the
name
of
zukrochene
flum
which
i
am
not
going
to
translate
because
it
is
uncomplimentary
my
sister
fetchke
was
always
the
good
little
girl
and
when
our
troubles
began
she
was
an
important
member
of
the
family
what
sort
of
little
girl
i
was
will
be
written
by
and
by
joseph
was
the
best
jewish
boy
that
ever
was
born
but
he
hated
to
go
to
heder
so
he
had
to
be
whipped
of
course
deborah
was
just
a
baby
and
her
principal
characteristic
was
if
she
had
teething
to
attend
to
she
thought
of
nothing
else
day
or
night
and
communicated
with
the
family
on
no
other
subject
if
it
was
she
whooped
most
heartily
if
it
was
measles
she
had
them
thick
it
was
the
normal
thing
in
polotzk
where
the
mothers
worked
as
well
as
the
fathers
for
the
children
to
be
left
in
the
hands
of
grandmothers
and
nursemaids
i
suffer
reminiscent
terrors
when
i
recall
deborah
nurse
who
never
opened
her
lips
except
to
frighten
us
children
or
else
to
lie
that
girl
never
told
the
truth
if
she
could
help
it
i
know
it
is
so
because
i
heard
her
tell
eleven
or
twelve
unnecessary
lies
every
day
in
the
beginning
of
her
residence
with
us
i
exposed
her
indignantly
every
time
i
caught
her
lying
but
the
tenor
of
her
private
conversations
with
me
was
conducive
to
a
cessation
of
my
activity
along
the
line
of
volunteer
testimony
in
shorter
words
the
nurse
terrified
me
with
horrid
threats
until
i
did
not
dare
to
contradict
her
even
if
she
lied
her
head
off
the
things
she
promised
me
in
this
life
and
in
the
life
to
come
could
not
be
executed
by
a
person
without
imagination
the
nurse
gave
almost
her
entire
attention
to
us
older
children
disposing
easily
of
the
claims
deborah
unless
she
was
teething
or
was
a
quiet
baby
and
would
lie
for
hours
on
the
nurse
lap
sucking
at
a
pacifier
made
of
bread
and
sugar
tied
up
in
a
muslin
rag
and
previously
chewed
to
a
pulp
by
the
nurse
and
while
the
baby
sucked
the
nurse
told
us
things
things
that
we
must
remember
when
we
went
to
bed
at
night
a
favorite
subject
of
her
discourse
was
the
evil
one
who
lived
so
she
told
us
in
our
attic
with
his
wife
and
brood
a
pet
amusement
of
our
invisible
tenant
was
the
translating
of
human
babies
into
his
lair
leaving
one
of
his
own
brats
in
the
cradle
the
moral
of
which
was
that
if
nurse
wanted
to
loaf
in
the
yard
and
watch
who
went
out
and
who
came
in
we
children
must
mind
the
baby
the
girl
was
so
sly
that
she
carried
on
all
this
tyranny
without
being
detected
and
we
lived
in
terror
till
she
was
discharged
for
stealing
in
our
grandmothers
we
were
very
fortunate
they
spoiled
us
to
our
hearts
content
grandma
deborah
methods
i
know
only
from
hearsay
for
i
was
very
little
when
she
died
grandma
rachel
i
remember
distinctly
spare
and
trim
and
always
busy
i
recall
her
coming
in
midwinter
from
the
frozen
village
where
she
lived
i
remember
as
if
it
were
but
last
winter
the
immense
shawls
and
wraps
which
we
unwound
from
about
her
person
her
voluminous
brown
sack
coat
in
which
there
was
room
for
three
of
us
at
a
time
and
at
last
the
tight
clasp
of
her
long
arms
and
her
fresh
cold
cheeks
on
ours
and
when
the
hugging
and
kissing
were
over
grandma
had
a
treat
for
us
it
was
or
oat
flour
which
we
mixed
with
cold
water
and
ate
raw
using
wooden
spoons
just
like
the
peasants
and
smacking
our
lips
over
it
in
imaginary
enjoyment
but
grandma
rachel
did
not
come
to
play
she
applied
herself
energetically
to
the
housekeeping
she
kept
her
bright
eye
on
everything
as
if
she
were
in
her
own
trifling
establishment
in
yuchovitch
watchful
was
she
as
any
cat
and
harmless
as
a
tame
rabbit
if
she
caught
the
maids
at
fault
she
found
an
excuse
for
them
at
the
same
time
if
she
was
quite
exasperated
with
the
stupidity
of
yakub
the
dvornik
she
pretended
to
curse
him
in
a
phrase
of
her
own
invention
a
mixture
of
hebrew
and
russian
which
translated
said
mayst
thou
have
gold
and
silver
in
thy
bosom
but
to
the
choreman
who
was
not
a
linguist
the
mongrel
phrase
conveyed
a
sense
of
his
delinquency
grandma
rachel
meant
to
be
very
strict
with
us
children
and
accordingly
was
prompt
to
discipline
us
but
we
discovered
early
in
our
acquaintance
with
her
that
the
child
who
got
a
spanking
was
sure
to
get
a
hot
cookie
or
the
jam
pot
to
lick
so
we
did
not
stand
in
great
awe
of
her
punishments
even
if
it
came
to
a
spanking
it
was
only
a
farce
grandma
generally
interposed
a
pillow
between
the
palm
of
her
hand
and
the
area
of
moral
stimulation
the
real
disciplinarian
in
our
family
was
my
father
present
or
absent
it
was
fear
of
his
displeasure
that
kept
us
in
the
straight
and
narrow
path
in
the
minds
of
us
children
he
was
as
much
represented
when
away
from
home
by
the
strap
hanging
on
the
wall
as
by
his
portrait
which
stood
on
a
parlor
table
in
a
gorgeous
frame
adorned
with
little
shells
almost
everybody
father
had
a
strap
but
our
father
strap
was
more
formidable
than
the
ordinary
for
one
thing
it
was
more
painful
to
encounter
personally
because
it
was
not
a
simple
strap
but
a
bunch
of
fine
long
strips
clinging
as
rubber
my
father
called
it
noodles
and
while
his
facetiousness
was
lost
on
us
children
the
superior
sting
of
his
instrument
was
entirely
effective
in
his
leisure
my
father
found
means
of
instructing
us
other
than
by
the
strap
he
took
us
walking
and
driving
answered
our
questions
and
taught
us
many
little
things
that
our
playmates
were
not
taught
from
distant
parts
of
the
country
he
had
imported
little
tricks
of
speech
and
conduct
which
we
learned
readily
enough
for
we
were
always
a
teachable
lot
our
pretty
manners
were
very
much
admired
so
that
we
became
used
to
being
held
up
as
models
to
children
less
polite
guests
at
our
table
praised
our
deportment
when
at
the
end
of
a
meal
we
kissed
the
hands
of
father
and
mother
and
thanked
them
for
food
envious
mothers
of
rowdy
children
used
to
sneer
those
grandchildren
of
raphael
the
russian
are
quite
the
aristocrats
illustration
my
father
portrait
and
yet
off
the
stage
we
had
our
little
quarrels
and
tempests
especially
i
really
and
truly
can
not
remember
a
time
when
fetchke
was
naughty
but
i
was
oftener
in
trouble
than
out
of
it
i
need
not
go
into
details
i
only
need
to
recall
how
often
on
going
to
bed
i
used
to
lie
silently
rehearsing
the
day
misdeeds
my
sister
refraining
from
talk
out
of
sympathy
as
i
always
came
to
the
conclusion
that
i
wanted
to
reform
i
emerged
from
my
reflections
with
this
solemn
formula
fetchke
let
us
be
good
and
my
generosity
in
including
my
sister
in
my
plans
for
salvation
was
equalled
by
her
magnanimity
in
assuming
part
of
my
degradation
she
always
replied
in
aspiration
as
eager
as
mine
yes
mashke
let
us
be
good
my
mother
had
less
to
do
than
any
one
with
our
early
training
because
she
was
confined
to
the
store
when
she
came
home
at
night
with
her
pockets
full
of
goodies
for
us
she
was
too
hungry
for
our
love
to
listen
to
tales
against
us
too
tired
from
work
to
discipline
us
it
was
only
on
sabbaths
and
holidays
that
she
had
a
chance
to
get
acquainted
with
us
and
we
all
looked
forward
to
these
days
of
enjoined
rest
on
friday
afternoons
my
parents
came
home
early
to
wash
and
dress
and
remove
from
their
persons
every
sign
of
labor
the
great
keys
of
the
store
were
put
away
out
of
sight
the
money
bag
was
hidden
in
the
featherbeds
my
father
put
on
his
best
coat
and
silk
my
mother
replaced
the
cotton
kerchief
by
the
wig
we
children
bustled
around
our
parents
asking
favors
in
the
name
of
the
sabbath
mama
let
fetchke
and
me
wear
our
new
shoes
in
honor
of
sabbath
or
papa
will
you
take
us
across
the
bridge
you
said
you
would
on
sabbath
and
while
we
adorned
ourselves
in
our
best
my
grandmother
superintended
the
sealing
of
the
oven
the
maids
washed
the
sweat
from
their
faces
and
the
dvornik
scraped
his
feet
at
the
door
my
father
and
brother
went
to
the
synagogue
while
we
women
and
girls
assembled
in
the
for
candle
prayer
the
table
gleamed
with
spotless
linen
and
china
at
my
father
place
lay
the
sabbath
loaf
covered
over
with
a
crocheted
doily
and
beside
it
stood
the
wine
flask
and
cup
of
gold
or
silver
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
table
was
a
long
row
of
brass
candlesticks
polished
to
perfection
with
the
heavy
silver
candlesticks
in
a
shorter
row
in
front
for
my
mother
and
grandmother
were
very
pious
and
each
used
a
number
of
candles
while
fetchke
and
i
and
the
maids
had
one
apiece
after
the
candle
prayer
the
women
generally
read
in
some
book
of
devotion
while
we
children
amused
ourselves
in
the
quietest
manner
till
the
men
returned
from
synagogue
good
sabbath
my
father
called
as
he
entered
and
good
sabbath
good
sabbath
we
wished
him
in
return
if
he
brought
with
him
a
sabbath
guest
from
the
synagogue
some
poor
man
without
a
home
the
stranger
was
welcomed
and
invited
in
and
placed
in
the
seat
of
honor
next
to
my
father
we
all
stood
around
the
table
while
or
the
blessing
over
the
wine
was
said
and
if
a
child
whispered
or
nudged
another
my
father
reproved
him
with
a
stern
look
and
began
again
from
the
beginning
but
as
soon
as
he
had
cut
the
consecrated
loaf
and
distributed
the
slices
we
were
at
liberty
to
talk
and
ask
questions
unless
a
guest
was
present
when
we
maintained
a
polite
silence
of
one
sabbath
guest
we
were
always
sure
even
if
no
destitute
jew
accompanied
my
father
from
the
synagogue
yakub
the
choreman
partook
of
the
festival
with
us
he
slept
on
a
bunk
built
over
the
entrance
door
and
reached
by
means
of
a
rude
flight
of
steps
there
he
liked
to
roll
on
his
straw
and
rags
whenever
he
was
not
busy
or
felt
especially
lazy
on
friday
evenings
he
climbed
to
his
roost
very
early
before
the
family
assembled
for
supper
and
waited
for
his
cue
which
was
the
of
table
talk
after
the
blessing
of
the
bread
then
yakub
began
to
clear
his
throat
and
kept
on
working
at
it
until
my
father
called
to
him
to
come
down
and
have
a
glass
of
vodka
sometimes
my
father
pretended
not
to
hear
him
and
we
smiled
at
one
another
around
the
table
while
yakub
throat
grew
worse
and
worse
and
he
began
to
cough
and
mutter
and
rustle
in
his
straw
then
my
father
let
him
come
down
and
he
shuffled
in
and
stood
clutching
his
cap
with
both
hands
while
my
father
poured
him
a
brimming
glass
of
whiskey
this
yakub
dedicated
to
all
our
healths
and
tossed
off
to
his
own
comfort
if
he
got
a
slice
of
boiled
fish
after
his
glassful
he
gulped
it
down
as
a
chicken
gulps
worms
smacked
his
lips
explosively
and
wiped
his
fingers
on
his
unkempt
locks
then
thanking
his
master
and
mistress
and
scraping
and
bowing
he
backed
out
of
the
room
and
ascended
to
his
roost
once
more
and
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
write
his
name
the
simple
fellow
was
asleep
and
snoring
the
snore
of
the
just
on
sabbath
morning
almost
everybody
went
to
synagogue
and
those
who
did
not
read
their
prayers
and
devotions
at
home
dinner
at
midday
was
a
pleasant
and
leisurely
meal
in
our
house
between
courses
my
father
led
us
in
singing
our
favorite
songs
sometimes
hebrew
sometimes
yiddish
sometimes
russian
or
some
of
the
songs
without
words
for
which
the
hasidim
were
famous
in
the
afternoon
we
went
visiting
or
else
we
took
long
walks
out
of
town
where
the
fields
sprouted
and
the
orchards
waited
to
bloom
if
we
stayed
at
home
we
were
not
without
company
neighbors
dropped
in
for
a
glass
of
tea
uncles
and
cousins
came
and
perhaps
my
brother
rebbe
to
examine
his
pupil
in
the
hearing
of
the
family
and
wherever
we
spent
the
day
the
talk
was
pleasant
the
faces
were
cheerful
and
the
joy
of
sabbath
pervaded
everything
the
festivals
were
observed
with
all
due
pomp
and
circumstance
in
our
house
passover
was
beautiful
with
shining
new
things
all
through
the
house
was
gay
with
feasting
and
presents
and
the
jolly
mummers
was
a
poem
lived
in
a
green
arbor
thrilled
our
hearts
with
its
symbols
and
promises
and
the
day
of
atonement
moved
even
the
laughing
children
to
a
longing
for
consecration
the
year
in
our
pious
house
was
an
endless
song
in
many
cantos
of
joy
lamentation
aspiration
and
rhapsody
we
children
while
we
regretted
the
passing
of
a
festival
found
plenty
to
content
us
in
the
common
days
of
the
week
we
had
everything
we
needed
and
almost
everything
we
wanted
we
were
welcomed
everywhere
petted
and
praised
abroad
as
well
as
at
home
i
suppose
no
little
girls
with
whom
we
played
had
a
more
comfortable
sense
of
being
than
fetchke
and
i
raphael
the
grandchildren
people
called
us
as
if
referring
to
the
quarterings
in
our
shield
it
was
very
pleasant
to
wear
fine
clothes
to
have
kopecks
to
spend
at
the
fruit
stalls
and
to
be
pointed
at
admiringly
some
of
the
little
girls
we
went
with
were
richer
than
we
but
after
all
mother
can
wear
only
one
pair
of
earrings
at
a
time
and
our
mother
had
beautiful
gold
ones
that
hung
down
on
her
neck
as
we
grew
older
my
parents
gave
us
more
than
physical
comfort
and
social
standing
to
rejoice
in
they
gave
us
or
set
out
to
give
us
education
which
was
less
common
than
gold
earrings
in
polotzk
for
the
ideal
of
a
modern
education
was
the
priceless
ware
that
my
father
brought
back
with
him
from
his
travels
in
distant
parts
his
travels
indeed
had
been
the
making
of
my
father
he
had
gone
away
from
polotzk
in
the
first
place
as
a
man
unfit
for
the
life
he
led
out
of
harmony
with
his
surroundings
at
odds
with
his
neighbors
never
heartily
devoted
to
the
religious
ideals
of
the
hebrew
scholar
he
was
more
and
more
a
dissenter
as
he
matured
but
he
hardly
knew
what
he
wanted
to
embrace
in
place
of
the
ideals
he
rejected
the
rigid
scheme
of
orthodox
jewish
life
in
the
pale
offered
no
opening
to
any
other
mode
of
life
but
in
the
large
cities
in
the
east
and
south
he
discovered
a
new
world
and
found
himself
at
home
in
it
the
jews
among
whom
he
lived
in
those
parts
were
faithful
to
the
essence
of
the
religion
but
they
allowed
themselves
more
latitude
in
practice
and
observance
than
the
people
in
polotzk
instead
of
bribing
government
officials
to
relax
the
law
of
compulsory
education
for
boys
these
people
pushed
in
numbers
at
every
open
door
of
culture
and
enlightenment
even
the
girls
were
given
books
in
odessa
and
kherson
as
the
rock
to
build
their
lives
on
and
not
as
an
ornament
for
idleness
my
father
mind
was
ready
for
the
reception
of
such
ideas
and
he
was
inspired
by
the
new
view
of
the
world
which
they
afforded
him
when
he
returned
to
polotzk
he
knew
what
had
been
wrong
with
his
life
before
and
he
proceeded
to
remedy
it
he
resolved
to
live
as
far
as
the
conditions
of
existence
in
polotzk
permitted
the
life
of
a
modern
man
and
he
saw
no
better
place
to
begin
than
with
the
education
of
the
children
outwardly
he
must
conform
to
the
ways
of
his
neighbors
just
as
he
must
pay
tribute
to
the
policeman
on
the
beat
for
standing
room
is
necessary
to
all
operations
and
social
ostracism
could
ruin
him
as
easily
as
police
persecution
his
children
if
he
started
them
right
would
not
have
to
bow
to
the
yoke
as
low
as
he
his
children
might
even
be
free
men
and
education
was
the
one
means
to
redemption
fetchke
and
i
were
started
with
a
rebbe
in
the
orthodox
way
but
we
were
taught
to
translate
as
well
as
read
hebrew
and
we
had
a
secular
teacher
besides
my
sister
and
i
were
very
diligent
pupils
and
my
father
took
great
satisfaction
in
our
progress
and
built
great
plans
for
our
higher
education
my
brother
who
was
five
years
old
when
he
entered
heder
hated
to
be
shut
up
all
day
over
a
printed
page
that
meant
nothing
to
him
he
cried
and
protested
but
my
father
was
determined
that
he
should
not
grow
up
ignorant
so
he
used
the
strap
freely
to
hasten
the
steps
to
school
the
heder
was
the
only
beginning
allowable
for
a
boy
in
polotzk
and
to
heder
joseph
must
go
so
the
poor
boy
life
was
made
a
nightmare
and
the
horror
was
not
lifted
until
he
was
ten
years
old
when
he
went
to
a
modern
school
where
intelligible
things
were
taught
and
it
proved
that
it
was
not
the
book
he
hated
but
the
blindness
of
the
heder
for
a
number
of
peaceful
years
after
my
father
return
from
far
russia
we
led
a
wholesome
life
of
comfort
contentment
and
faith
in
everything
prospered
and
we
children
grew
in
the
sun
my
mother
was
one
with
my
father
in
all
his
plans
for
us
although
she
had
spent
her
young
years
in
the
pursuit
of
the
ruble
it
was
more
to
her
that
our
teacher
praised
us
than
that
she
had
made
a
good
bargain
with
a
tea
merchant
fetchke
and
joseph
and
i
and
deborah
when
she
grew
up
had
some
prospects
even
in
polotzk
with
our
parents
hearts
set
on
the
highest
things
but
we
were
destined
to
seek
our
fortunes
in
a
world
which
even
my
father
did
not
dream
of
when
he
settled
down
to
business
in
polotzk
just
when
he
felt
himself
safe
and
strong
a
long
series
of
troubles
set
in
to
harass
us
and
in
a
few
years
time
we
were
reduced
to
a
state
of
helpless
poverty
in
which
there
was
no
room
to
think
of
anything
but
bread
my
father
became
seriously
ill
and
spent
large
sums
on
cures
that
did
not
cure
him
while
he
was
still
an
invalid
my
mother
also
became
ill
and
kept
her
bed
for
the
better
part
of
two
years
when
she
got
up
it
was
only
to
lapse
again
some
of
us
children
also
fell
ill
so
that
at
one
period
the
house
was
a
hospital
and
while
my
parents
were
incapacitated
the
business
was
ruined
through
bad
management
until
a
day
came
when
there
was
not
enough
money
in
the
cash
drawer
to
pay
the
doctor
bills
for
some
years
after
they
got
upon
their
feet
again
my
parents
struggled
to
regain
their
place
in
the
business
world
but
failed
to
do
so
my
father
had
another
period
of
experimenting
with
this
or
that
business
like
his
earlier
experience
but
everything
went
wrong
till
at
last
he
made
a
great
resolve
to
begin
life
all
over
again
and
the
way
to
do
that
was
to
start
on
a
new
soil
my
father
determined
to
emigrate
to
america
i
have
now
told
who
i
am
what
my
people
were
how
i
began
life
and
why
i
was
brought
to
a
new
home
up
to
this
point
i
have
borrowed
the
recollections
of
my
parents
to
piece
out
my
own
fragmentary
reminiscences
but
from
now
on
i
propose
to
be
my
own
pilot
across
the
seas
of
memory
and
if
i
lose
myself
in
the
mists
of
uncertainty
or
run
aground
on
the
reefs
of
speculation
i
still
hope
to
make
port
at
last
and
i
shall
look
for
welcoming
faces
on
the
shore
for
the
ship
i
sail
in
is
history
and
facts
will
kindle
my
beacon
fires
chapter
v
i
remember
my
father
and
mother
could
tell
me
much
more
that
i
have
forgotten
or
that
i
never
was
aware
of
but
i
want
to
reconstruct
my
childhood
from
those
broken
recollections
only
which
recurring
to
me
in
after
years
filled
me
with
the
pain
and
wonder
of
remembrance
i
want
to
string
together
those
glimpses
of
my
earliest
days
that
dangle
in
my
mind
like
little
lanterns
in
the
crooked
alleys
of
the
past
and
show
me
an
elusive
little
figure
that
is
myself
and
yet
so
much
a
stranger
to
me
that
i
often
ask
can
this
be
i
i
have
not
much
faith
in
the
reality
of
my
first
recollection
but
as
i
can
never
go
back
over
the
past
without
bringing
up
at
last
at
this
sombre
little
scene
as
at
a
door
beyond
which
i
can
not
pass
i
must
put
it
down
for
what
it
is
worth
in
the
scheme
of
my
memories
i
see
then
an
empty
darkened
room
in
the
middle
on
the
floor
lies
a
long
shape
covered
with
some
black
stuff
there
are
candles
at
the
head
of
the
shape
dim
figures
are
seated
low
against
the
walls
swaying
to
and
fro
no
sound
is
in
the
room
except
a
moan
or
a
sigh
from
the
shadowy
figures
but
a
child
is
walking
softly
around
and
around
the
shape
on
the
floor
in
quiet
curiosity
the
shape
is
the
body
of
my
grandfather
laid
out
for
burial
the
child
is
myself
myself
asking
questions
of
death
i
was
four
years
old
when
my
mother
father
died
do
i
really
remember
the
little
scene
perhaps
i
heard
it
described
by
some
fond
relative
as
i
heard
other
anecdotes
of
my
infancy
and
unconsciously
incorporated
it
with
my
genuine
recollections
it
is
so
suitable
a
scene
for
a
beginning
the
darkness
the
mystery
the
impenetrability
my
share
in
it
too
is
characteristic
enough
if
i
really
studied
that
shape
by
the
lighted
candles
as
i
have
always
pretended
to
myself
so
often
afterwards
i
find
myself
forgetting
the
conventional
meanings
of
things
in
some
search
for
a
meaning
of
my
own
it
is
more
likely
however
that
i
took
no
intellectual
interest
in
my
grandfather
remains
at
the
time
but
later
on
when
i
sought
for
a
first
recollection
perhaps
elaborated
the
scene
and
my
part
in
it
to
something
that
satisfied
my
sense
of
dramatic
fitness
if
i
really
committed
such
a
fraud
i
am
now
well
punished
by
being
obliged
at
the
very
start
to
discredit
the
authenticity
of
my
memoirs
the
abode
of
our
childhood
if
not
revisited
in
later
years
is
apt
to
loom
in
our
imagination
as
a
vast
edifice
with
immense
chambers
in
which
our
little
self
seems
lost
somehow
i
have
failed
of
this
illusion
my
grandfather
house
where
i
was
born
stands
in
my
memory
a
small
wooden
building
whose
chimneys
touch
the
sky
at
the
same
level
as
its
neighbors
chimneys
such
as
it
was
the
house
stood
even
with
the
sidewalk
but
the
yard
was
screened
from
the
street
by
a
board
fence
outside
which
i
am
sure
there
was
a
bench
the
gate
into
the
yard
swung
so
high
from
the
ground
that
visitors
did
not
have
to
wait
till
it
was
opened
pigs
found
their
way
in
and
were
shown
the
way
out
under
the
gate
grunting
on
their
arrival
but
squealing
on
their
departure
illustration
my
grandfather
house
where
i
was
born
of
the
interior
of
the
house
i
remember
only
one
room
and
not
so
much
the
room
as
the
window
which
had
a
blue
sash
curtain
and
beyond
the
curtain
a
view
of
a
narrow
walled
garden
where
dahlias
grew
the
garden
belonged
to
the
house
adjoining
my
grandfather
where
lived
the
gentile
girl
who
was
kind
to
me
concerning
my
dahlias
i
have
been
told
that
they
were
not
dahlias
at
all
but
poppies
as
a
conscientious
historian
i
am
bound
to
record
every
rumor
but
i
retain
the
right
to
cling
to
my
own
impression
indeed
i
must
insist
on
my
dahlias
if
i
am
to
preserve
the
garden
at
all
i
have
so
long
believed
in
them
that
if
i
try
to
see
in
those
red
masses
over
the
wall
the
whole
garden
crumbles
away
and
leaves
me
a
gray
blank
i
have
nothing
against
poppies
it
is
only
that
my
illusion
is
more
real
to
me
than
reality
and
so
do
we
often
build
our
world
on
an
error
and
cry
out
that
the
universe
is
falling
to
pieces
if
any
one
but
lift
a
finger
to
replace
the
error
by
truth
ours
was
a
quiet
neighborhood
across
the
narrow
street
was
the
orderly
front
of
the
korpus
or
military
academy
with
straight
rows
of
unshuttered
windows
it
was
an
imposing
edifice
in
the
eyes
of
us
all
because
it
was
built
of
brick
and
was
several
stories
high
at
one
of
the
windows
i
pretend
i
remember
seeing
a
tailor
mending
the
uniforms
of
the
cadets
i
knew
the
uniforms
and
i
knew
in
later
years
the
man
who
had
been
the
tailor
but
i
am
not
sure
that
he
did
not
emigrate
to
america
there
to
seek
his
fortune
in
a
candy
shop
and
his
happiness
in
a
family
of
triplets
twins
and
even
odds
long
before
i
was
old
enough
to
toddle
as
far
as
the
gate
behind
my
grandfather
house
was
a
low
hill
which
i
do
remember
as
a
mountain
perhaps
it
was
only
a
hump
in
the
ground
this
eminence
of
whatever
stature
was
a
part
of
the
vall
a
longer
and
higher
ridge
on
the
top
of
which
was
a
promenade
and
which
was
said
to
be
the
of
napoleonic
soldiers
this
historic
rumor
meant
very
little
to
me
for
i
never
knew
what
napoleon
was
it
was
not
my
way
to
accept
unchallenged
every
superstition
that
came
to
my
ears
among
the
wild
flowers
that
grew
on
the
grassy
slopes
of
the
vall
there
was
a
small
daisy
popularly
called
blind
flower
because
it
was
supposed
to
cause
blindness
in
rash
children
who
picked
it
i
was
rash
if
i
was
awake
and
i
picked
blind
flowers
behind
the
house
handfuls
of
them
and
enjoyed
my
eyesight
unimpaired
if
my
faith
in
nursery
lore
was
shaken
by
this
experience
i
kept
my
discovery
to
myself
and
did
not
undertake
to
enlighten
my
playmates
i
find
other
instances
later
on
of
the
curious
fact
that
i
was
content
with
for
myself
it
is
curious
to
me
because
i
am
not
so
reticent
now
when
i
discover
anything
if
only
a
new
tint
in
the
red
sunset
i
must
publish
the
fact
to
all
my
friends
is
it
possible
that
in
my
childish
reflections
i
recognized
the
fact
that
ours
was
a
secretive
atmosphere
where
knowledge
was
for
the
few
and
wisdom
was
sometimes
a
capital
offence
in
the
i
lived
outdoors
considerably
i
found
many
occasions
to
visit
my
mother
in
the
store
which
gave
me
a
long
walk
if
my
errand
was
not
pressing
or
perhaps
even
if
it
was
i
made
a
long
stop
on
the
platz
especially
if
i
had
a
companion
with
me
the
platz
was
a
rectangular
space
in
the
centre
of
a
roomy
square
with
a
shady
promenade
around
its
level
lawn
the
korpus
faced
on
the
platz
which
was
its
drill
ground
around
the
square
were
grouped
the
fine
residences
of
the
officers
of
the
korpus
with
a
great
white
church
occupying
one
side
these
buildings
had
a
fearful
interest
for
me
especially
the
church
as
the
dwellings
and
sanctuary
of
the
enemy
but
on
the
platz
i
was
not
afraid
to
play
and
seek
adventures
i
loved
to
watch
the
cadets
drill
and
play
ball
or
pass
them
close
as
they
promenaded
two
and
two
looking
so
perfect
in
white
trousers
and
jackets
and
visored
caps
i
loved
to
run
with
my
playmates
and
lay
out
all
sorts
of
geometric
figures
on
the
four
straight
sides
of
the
promenade
patterns
of
infinite
variety
traceable
only
by
a
pair
of
tireless
feet
if
one
got
so
wild
with
play
as
to
forget
all
fear
one
could
swing
until
chased
away
by
the
guard
on
the
heavy
chain
festoons
that
encircled
the
monument
at
one
side
of
the
square
this
was
the
only
monument
in
polotzk
dedicated
i
never
knew
to
whom
or
what
it
was
the
monument
as
the
sky
was
the
sky
and
the
earth
earth
the
only
phenomenon
of
its
kind
mysterious
unquestionable
it
was
not
far
from
the
limits
of
polotzk
to
the
fields
and
woods
my
father
was
fond
of
taking
us
children
for
a
long
walk
on
a
sabbath
afternoon
i
have
little
pictures
in
my
mind
of
places
where
we
went
though
i
doubt
if
they
could
be
found
from
my
descriptions
i
try
in
vain
to
conjure
up
a
panoramic
view
of
the
neighborhood
even
when
i
stood
on
the
apex
of
the
vall
and
saw
the
level
country
spread
in
all
directions
my
inexperienced
eyes
failed
to
give
me
the
picture
of
the
whole
i
saw
the
houses
in
the
streets
below
all
going
to
market
the
highroads
wandered
out
into
the
country
and
disappeared
in
the
sunny
distance
where
the
edge
of
the
earth
and
the
edge
of
the
sky
fitted
together
like
a
jewel
box
with
the
lid
ajar
in
these
things
i
saw
what
a
child
always
sees
the
unrelated
fragments
of
a
vast
mysterious
world
but
although
my
geography
may
be
vague
and
the
scenes
i
remember
as
the
pieces
of
a
paper
puzzle
still
my
breath
catches
as
i
replace
this
bit
or
that
and
coax
the
edges
to
fit
together
i
am
obstinately
positive
of
some
points
and
for
the
rest
you
may
amend
the
puzzle
if
you
can
you
may
make
a
survey
of
polotzk
ever
so
accurate
and
show
me
where
i
was
wrong
still
i
am
the
better
guide
you
may
show
that
my
adventureful
road
led
nowhere
but
i
can
prove
by
the
quickening
of
my
pulse
and
the
throbbing
of
my
rapid
recollections
that
happened
to
there
or
here
and
i
shall
be
believed
not
you
and
so
over
the
vague
canvas
of
scenes
half
remembered
half
imagined
i
draw
the
brush
of
recollection
and
pick
out
here
a
landmark
there
a
figure
and
set
my
own
feet
back
in
the
old
ways
and
live
over
the
old
events
it
is
real
enough
as
by
my
beating
heart
you
might
know
sometimes
my
father
took
us
out
by
the
long
road
there
is
no
road
in
the
neighborhood
of
polotzk
by
that
name
but
i
know
very
well
that
the
way
was
long
to
my
little
feet
and
long
are
the
backward
thoughts
that
creep
along
it
like
a
sunbeam
travelling
with
the
day
the
first
landmark
on
the
sunny
dusty
road
is
the
house
of
a
peasant
acquaintance
where
we
stopped
for
rest
and
a
drink
i
remember
a
cool
gray
interior
a
woman
with
her
bosom
uncovered
pattering
barefoot
to
hand
us
the
hospitable
dipper
and
a
baby
smothered
in
a
deep
cradle
which
hung
by
ropes
from
the
ceiling
farther
on
the
empty
road
gave
us
shadows
of
trees
and
rustlings
of
long
grass
this
at
least
is
what
i
imagine
over
the
spaces
where
no
certain
object
is
then
i
know
we
ran
and
played
and
it
was
father
himself
who
hid
in
the
corn
and
we
made
havoc
following
after
laughing
we
ramble
on
till
we
hear
the
long
far
whistle
of
a
locomotive
the
railroad
track
is
just
visible
over
the
field
on
the
of
the
road
the
cornfield
i
say
is
on
the
we
stand
on
tiptoe
and
wave
our
hands
and
shout
as
the
long
train
rushes
by
at
a
terrific
speed
leaving
its
pennon
of
smoke
behind
the
passing
of
the
train
thrilled
me
wonderfully
where
did
it
come
from
and
whither
did
it
fly
and
how
did
it
feel
to
be
one
of
the
faces
at
the
windows
if
ever
i
dreamed
of
a
world
beyond
polotzk
it
must
have
been
at
those
times
though
i
do
not
honestly
remember
somewhere
out
on
that
same
long
road
is
the
place
where
we
once
attended
a
wedding
i
do
not
know
who
were
married
or
whether
they
lived
happily
ever
after
but
i
remember
that
when
the
dancers
were
wearied
and
we
were
all
sated
with
goodies
day
was
dawning
and
several
of
the
young
people
went
out
for
a
stroll
in
a
grove
near
by
they
took
me
with
them
who
were
they
and
they
lost
me
at
any
rate
when
they
saw
me
again
i
was
a
stranger
for
i
had
sojourned
for
an
immeasurable
moment
in
a
world
apart
from
theirs
i
had
witnessed
my
first
sunrise
i
had
watched
the
rosy
morning
tiptoe
in
among
the
silver
birches
and
that
grove
stands
on
the
side
of
the
road
we
had
another
out
in
that
direction
it
was
the
place
where
my
mother
sent
her
hundred
and
more
house
plants
to
be
cared
for
one
season
because
for
some
reason
they
could
not
fare
well
at
home
we
children
went
to
visit
them
once
and
the
memory
of
that
is
red
and
white
and
purple
the
long
road
went
ever
on
and
on
i
remember
no
turns
but
we
turned
at
last
when
the
sun
was
set
and
the
breeze
of
evening
blew
and
sometimes
the
first
star
came
in
and
the
sabbath
went
out
before
we
reached
home
and
supper
another
way
out
of
town
was
by
the
bridge
across
the
polota
i
recall
more
than
one
excursion
in
that
direction
sometimes
we
made
a
large
party
annexing
a
few
cousins
and
aunts
for
the
day
at
this
moment
i
feel
a
movement
of
affection
for
these
relations
who
shared
our
country
adventures
i
had
forgotten
what
virtue
there
was
in
our
family
i
do
like
people
who
can
walk
in
those
days
it
is
likely
enough
i
did
not
always
walk
on
my
own
legs
for
i
was
very
little
and
not
strong
i
do
not
remember
being
carried
but
if
any
of
my
big
uncles
gave
me
a
lift
i
am
sure
i
like
them
all
the
more
for
it
the
dvina
river
swallowed
the
polota
many
times
a
day
yet
the
lesser
stream
flooded
the
universe
on
one
occasion
on
the
hither
bank
of
that
stream
as
you
go
from
polotzk
i
should
plant
a
flowering
bush
a
lilac
or
a
rose
in
memory
of
the
life
that
bloomed
in
me
one
day
that
i
was
there
leisurely
we
had
strolled
out
of
the
peaceful
town
it
was
early
spring
and
the
sky
and
the
earth
were
two
warm
palms
in
which
all
live
things
nestled
little
green
leaves
trembled
on
the
trees
and
the
green
green
grass
sparkled
we
sat
us
down
to
rest
a
little
above
the
bridge
and
life
flowed
in
and
out
of
us
fully
freely
as
the
river
flowed
and
parted
about
the
bridge
piles
a
market
garden
lay
on
the
opposite
slope
with
first
growth
in
the
long
black
furrows
yet
unsown
a
peasant
pushed
his
plow
i
watched
him
go
up
and
down
leaving
a
new
black
line
on
the
bank
for
every
turn
suddenly
he
began
to
sing
a
rude
plowman
song
only
the
melody
reached
me
but
the
meaning
sprang
up
in
my
heart
to
fit
it
a
song
of
the
earth
and
the
hopes
of
the
earth
i
sat
a
long
time
listening
looking
tense
with
attention
i
felt
myself
discovering
things
something
in
me
gasped
for
life
and
lay
still
i
was
but
a
little
body
and
life
universal
had
suddenly
burst
upon
me
for
a
moment
i
had
my
little
hand
on
the
great
pulse
but
my
fingers
slipped
empty
for
the
space
of
a
wild
heartbeat
i
and
then
i
was
again
a
simple
child
looking
to
my
earthly
senses
for
life
but
the
sky
had
stretched
for
me
the
earth
had
expanded
a
greater
life
had
dawned
in
me
we
are
not
born
all
at
once
but
by
bits
the
body
first
and
the
spirit
later
and
the
birth
and
growth
of
the
spirit
in
those
who
are
attentive
to
their
own
inner
life
are
slow
and
exceedingly
painful
our
mothers
are
racked
with
the
pains
of
our
physical
birth
we
ourselves
suffer
the
longer
pains
of
our
spiritual
growth
our
souls
are
scarred
with
the
struggles
of
successive
births
and
the
process
is
recorded
also
by
the
wrinkles
in
our
brains
by
the
lines
in
our
faces
look
at
me
and
you
will
see
that
i
have
been
born
many
times
and
my
first
happened
as
i
have
told
that
spring
day
of
my
early
springs
therefore
would
i
plant
a
rose
on
the
green
bank
of
the
polota
there
to
bloom
in
token
of
eternal
life
eternal
divine
life
this
is
a
tale
of
immortal
life
should
i
be
sitting
here
chattering
of
my
infantile
adventures
if
i
did
not
know
that
i
was
speaking
for
thousands
should
you
be
sitting
there
attending
to
my
chatter
while
the
world
work
waits
if
you
did
not
know
that
i
spoke
also
for
you
i
might
say
you
or
he
instead
of
i
or
i
might
be
silent
while
you
spoke
for
me
and
the
rest
but
for
the
accident
that
i
was
born
with
a
pen
in
my
hand
and
you
without
we
love
to
read
the
lives
of
the
great
yet
what
a
broken
history
of
mankind
they
give
unless
supplemented
by
the
lives
of
the
humble
but
while
the
great
can
speak
for
themselves
or
by
the
tongues
of
their
admirers
the
humble
are
apt
to
live
inarticulate
and
die
unheard
it
is
well
that
now
and
then
one
is
born
among
the
simple
with
a
taste
for
the
man
or
woman
thus
endowed
must
speak
will
speak
though
there
are
only
the
grasses
in
the
field
to
hear
and
none
but
the
wind
to
carry
the
tale
it
is
fun
to
run
over
the
bridge
with
a
clatter
of
stout
little
shoes
on
resounding
timbers
we
pass
a
walled
orchard
on
the
right
and
remind
each
other
of
the
fruit
we
enjoyed
here
last
summer
our
next
is
farther
on
beyond
the
wayside
inn
where
lives
the
idiot
boy
who
gave
me
such
a
scare
last
time
it
is
a
poor
enough
place
where
we
stop
but
there
is
an
ice
house
the
only
one
i
know
we
are
allowed
to
go
in
and
see
the
greenish
masses
of
ice
gleaming
in
the
and
bring
out
jars
of
sweet
black
lager
beer
which
we
drink
in
the
sunny
doorway
i
shall
always
remember
the
flavor
of
the
stuff
and
the
smell
and
the
wonder
and
chill
of
the
ice
house
i
vaguely
remember
something
about
a
convent
out
in
that
direction
but
i
was
tired
and
sleepy
after
my
long
walk
and
glad
to
be
returning
home
i
hope
they
carried
me
a
bit
of
the
way
for
i
was
very
tired
there
were
stars
out
before
we
reached
home
and
the
men
stopped
in
the
middle
of
the
street
to
bless
the
new
moon
it
is
pleasant
to
recall
how
we
went
bathing
in
the
polota
on
friday
afternoons
in
summer
when
the
week
work
was
done
and
the
houses
of
the
good
housewives
stood
shining
with
cleanliness
ready
for
the
sabbath
parties
of
women
and
girls
went
chattering
and
laughing
down
to
the
river
bank
there
was
a
particular
spot
which
belonged
to
the
women
i
do
not
know
where
the
men
bathed
but
our
part
of
the
river
was
just
above
bonderoff
gristmill
i
can
see
the
green
bank
sloping
to
the
water
and
the
still
water
sliding
down
to
the
sudden
swirl
and
spray
of
the
mill
race
the
woods
on
the
bank
screened
the
bathers
bathing
costumes
were
simply
absent
which
caused
the
mermaids
no
embarrassment
for
they
were
accustomed
to
see
each
other
naked
in
the
public
hot
baths
they
had
little
fear
of
intrusion
for
the
spot
was
sacred
to
them
they
splashed
about
and
laughed
and
played
tricks
with
streaming
hair
and
free
gestures
i
do
not
know
when
i
saw
the
girls
play
as
they
did
in
the
water
it
was
a
pretty
picture
but
the
bathers
would
have
been
shocked
beyond
your
understanding
if
you
had
suggested
that
naked
women
might
be
put
into
a
picture
if
it
ever
happened
as
it
happened
at
least
once
for
me
to
remember
that
their
privacy
was
outraged
the
bathers
were
thrown
into
a
panic
as
if
their
very
lives
were
threatened
screaming
they
huddled
together
low
in
the
water
some
hiding
their
eyes
in
their
hands
with
the
instinct
of
the
ostrich
some
ran
for
their
clothes
on
the
bank
and
stood
shrinking
behind
some
inadequate
rag
the
more
spirited
of
the
naiads
threw
pebbles
at
the
cowardly
intruders
who
safe
behind
the
leafy
cover
that
was
meant
to
shield
modesty
threw
jeers
and
mockery
in
return
but
the
gentile
boys
ran
away
soon
or
ran
away
punished
a
chemise
and
a
petticoat
turn
a
frightened
woman
into
an
amazon
in
such
circumstances
and
woe
to
the
impudent
wretch
who
lingered
after
the
avengers
plunged
into
the
thicket
slaps
and
cuffs
at
close
range
were
his
portion
and
curses
pursued
him
in
retreat
among
the
liveliest
of
my
memories
are
those
of
eating
and
drinking
and
i
would
sooner
give
up
some
of
my
delightful
remembered
walks
green
trees
cool
skies
and
all
than
to
lose
my
images
of
suppers
eaten
on
sabbath
evenings
at
the
end
of
those
walks
i
make
no
apology
to
the
spiritually
minded
to
whom
this
statement
must
be
a
revelation
of
grossness
i
am
content
to
tell
the
truth
as
well
as
i
am
able
i
do
not
even
need
to
console
myself
with
the
reflection
that
what
is
dross
to
the
dreamy
ascetic
may
be
gold
to
the
psychologist
the
fact
is
that
i
ate
even
as
a
delicate
child
with
considerable
relish
and
i
remember
eating
with
a
relish
still
keener
why
i
can
dream
away
a
on
the
immortal
flavor
of
those
thick
cheese
cakes
we
used
to
have
on
saturday
night
i
am
no
cook
so
i
can
not
tell
you
how
to
make
such
cake
i
might
borrow
the
recipe
from
my
mother
but
i
would
rather
you
should
take
my
word
for
the
excellence
of
polotzk
cheese
cakes
if
you
should
attempt
that
pastry
i
am
certain
be
you
ever
so
clever
a
cook
you
would
be
disappointed
by
the
result
and
hence
you
might
be
led
to
mistrust
my
reflections
and
conclusions
you
have
nothing
in
your
kitchen
cupboard
to
give
the
pastry
its
notable
flavor
it
takes
history
to
make
such
a
cake
first
you
must
eat
it
as
a
ravenous
child
in
memorable
twilights
before
the
lighting
of
the
lamp
then
you
must
have
yourself
removed
from
the
house
of
your
simple
feast
across
the
oceans
to
a
land
where
your
cherished
pastry
is
unknown
even
by
name
and
where
daylight
and
twilight
work
day
and
fête
day
for
years
rush
by
you
in
the
unbroken
tide
of
a
strange
new
overfull
life
you
must
abstain
from
the
inimitable
morsel
for
a
period
of
years
i
think
fifteen
is
the
magic
number
and
then
suddenly
one
day
rub
the
aladdin
lamp
of
memory
and
have
the
renowned
tidbit
whisked
upon
your
platter
garnished
with
a
hundred
sweet
herbs
of
past
association
do
you
think
all
your
imported
spices
all
your
scientific
blending
and
manipulating
could
produce
so
fragrant
a
morsel
as
that
which
i
have
on
my
tongue
as
i
write
glad
am
i
that
my
mother
in
her
assiduous
imitation
of
everything
american
has
forgotten
the
secrets
of
polotzk
cookery
at
any
rate
she
does
not
practise
it
and
i
am
the
richer
in
memories
for
her
omissions
polotzk
cheese
cake
as
i
now
know
it
has
in
it
the
flavor
of
daisies
and
clover
picked
on
the
vall
the
sweetness
of
dvina
water
the
richness
of
newly
turned
earth
which
i
moulded
with
bare
feet
and
hands
the
ripeness
of
red
cherries
bought
by
the
dipperful
in
the
market
place
the
fragrance
of
all
my
childhood
summers
abstinence
as
i
have
mentioned
is
one
of
the
essential
ingredients
in
the
phantom
dish
i
discovered
this
through
a
recent
experience
it
was
cherry
time
in
the
country
and
the
sight
of
the
scarlet
fruit
suddenly
reminded
me
of
a
cherry
season
in
polotzk
i
could
not
say
how
many
years
ago
on
that
earlier
occasion
my
cousin
shimke
who
like
everybody
else
was
a
storekeeper
had
set
a
boy
to
watch
her
store
and
me
to
watch
the
boy
while
she
went
home
to
make
cherry
preserves
she
gave
us
a
basket
of
cherries
for
our
trouble
and
the
boy
offered
to
eat
them
with
the
stones
if
i
would
give
him
my
share
but
i
was
equal
to
that
feat
myself
so
we
sat
down
to
a
contest
who
ate
the
most
stones
i
could
not
remember
as
i
stood
under
the
laden
trees
not
long
ago
but
the
transcendent
flavor
of
the
historical
cherries
came
back
to
me
and
i
needs
must
enjoy
it
once
more
i
climbed
into
the
lowest
boughs
and
hung
there
eating
cherries
with
the
stones
my
whole
mind
concentrated
on
the
sense
of
taste
alas
the
fruit
had
no
such
flavor
to
yield
as
i
sought
excellent
american
cherries
were
these
but
not
so
fragrantly
sweet
as
my
cherries
and
if
i
should
return
to
polotzk
and
buy
me
a
measure
of
cherries
at
a
market
stall
and
pay
for
it
with
a
russian
groschen
would
the
market
woman
be
generous
enough
to
throw
in
that
haunting
flavor
i
fear
i
should
find
that
the
old
species
of
cherry
is
extinct
in
polotzk
sometimes
when
i
am
not
trying
to
remember
at
all
i
am
more
fortunate
in
extracting
the
flavors
of
past
feasts
from
my
plain
american
viands
i
was
eating
strawberries
the
other
day
ripe
red
american
strawberries
suddenly
i
experienced
the
very
flavor
and
aroma
of
some
strawberries
i
ate
perhaps
twenty
years
ago
i
started
as
from
a
shock
and
then
sat
still
for
i
do
not
know
how
long
breathless
with
amazement
in
the
brief
interval
of
a
gustatory
perception
i
became
a
child
again
and
i
positively
ached
with
the
pain
of
being
so
suddenly
compressed
to
that
small
being
i
wandered
about
polotzk
once
more
with
large
questioning
eyes
i
rode
the
atlantic
in
an
emigrant
ship
i
took
possession
of
the
new
world
my
ears
growing
accustomed
to
a
new
language
i
sat
at
the
feet
of
renowned
professors
till
my
eyes
contracted
in
dreaming
over
what
they
taught
and
there
i
was
again
an
american
among
americans
suddenly
made
aware
of
all
that
i
had
been
all
that
i
had
become
suddenly
illuminated
inspired
by
a
complete
vision
of
myself
a
daughter
of
israel
and
a
child
of
the
universe
that
taught
me
more
of
the
history
of
my
race
than
ever
my
learned
teachers
could
understand
all
this
came
to
me
in
that
instant
of
tasting
all
from
the
flavor
of
ripe
strawberries
on
my
tongue
why
then
should
i
not
treasure
my
memories
of
childhood
feasts
this
experience
gives
me
a
great
respect
for
my
bread
and
meat
i
want
to
taste
of
as
many
viands
as
possible
for
when
i
sit
down
to
a
dish
of
porridge
i
am
certain
of
rising
again
a
better
animal
and
i
may
rise
a
wiser
man
i
want
to
eat
and
drink
and
be
instructed
some
day
i
expect
to
extract
from
my
pudding
the
flavor
of
manna
which
i
ate
in
the
desert
and
then
i
shall
write
you
a
contemporaneous
commentary
on
the
exodus
nor
do
i
despair
of
remembering
yet
over
a
dish
of
corn
the
time
when
i
fed
on
worms
and
then
i
may
be
able
to
recall
how
it
felt
to
be
made
at
last
into
a
man
give
me
to
eat
and
drink
for
i
crave
wisdom
my
winters
while
i
was
a
very
little
girl
were
passed
in
comparative
confinement
on
account
of
my
delicate
health
my
grandmother
and
aunts
deemed
it
wise
to
keep
me
indoors
or
if
i
went
out
i
was
so
heavily
coated
and
mittened
and
shawled
that
the
frost
scarcely
got
a
chance
at
the
tip
of
my
nose
i
never
skated
or
coasted
or
built
snow
houses
if
i
had
any
experience
of
snowballs
it
was
with
those
thrown
at
me
by
the
gentile
boys
the
way
i
dodge
a
snowball
to
this
day
makes
me
certain
that
i
learned
the
act
in
my
fearful
childhood
days
when
i
learned
so
many
cowardly
tricks
of
bending
to
a
blow
i
know
that
i
was
proud
of
myself
when
not
many
years
ago
i
found
i
was
not
afraid
to
stand
up
and
catch
a
flying
baseball
but
the
fear
of
the
snowball
i
have
not
conquered
when
i
turn
a
corner
in
snowball
days
the
boys
with
bulging
pockets
see
a
head
held
high
and
a
step
unquickened
but
i
know
that
i
cringe
inwardly
and
this
private
mortification
i
set
down
against
old
polotzk
in
my
long
score
of
grievances
and
shames
fear
is
a
devil
hard
to
cast
out
let
me
make
the
most
of
the
winter
adventures
that
i
recall
first
there
was
sleighing
we
never
kept
horses
of
our
own
but
the
horses
of
our
were
always
at
our
disposal
and
many
a
jolly
ride
they
gave
us
with
the
dvornik
at
the
reins
while
their
owners
haggled
with
my
mother
in
the
store
about
the
price
of
soap
we
had
no
luxurious
sleigh
with
cushions
and
fur
robes
no
silver
bells
on
our
harness
ours
was
a
bare
sledge
used
for
hauling
wood
with
a
padding
of
straw
and
burlap
and
the
reins
as
likely
as
not
were
a
knotted
rope
but
the
horses
did
fly
over
the
river
and
up
the
opposite
bank
if
we
chose
and
whether
we
had
bells
or
not
the
merry
foolish
heart
of
yakub
would
sing
and
the
whip
would
crack
and
we
children
would
laugh
and
the
sport
was
as
good
as
when
occasionally
we
did
ride
in
a
more
splendid
sleigh
loaned
us
by
one
of
our
prouder
guests
we
were
wholesome
as
apples
to
look
at
when
we
returned
for
bread
and
tea
in
the
dusk
at
least
i
remember
my
sister
with
cheeks
as
red
as
a
painted
doll
under
her
curls
and
my
little
brother
rosy
too
and
enough
in
his
little
greatcoat
tied
with
a
red
sash
and
little
fur
cap
with
earlaps
for
myself
i
suppose
my
nose
was
purple
and
my
cheeks
pinched
just
as
they
are
now
in
the
cold
weather
but
i
had
a
good
time
at
certain
i
mean
uncertain
intervals
we
were
bundled
up
and
marched
to
the
public
baths
this
was
so
great
an
undertaking
consuming
half
a
day
or
so
and
involving
in
winter
such
risk
of
catching
cold
that
it
is
no
wonder
the
ceremony
was
not
practised
oftener
the
public
baths
were
situated
on
the
river
bank
i
always
stopped
awhile
outside
to
visit
the
poor
patient
horse
in
the
treadmill
by
means
of
which
the
water
was
pumped
into
the
baths
i
was
not
sentimental
about
animals
then
i
had
not
read
of
black
beauty
or
any
other
personified
monsters
i
had
not
heard
of
any
societies
for
the
prevention
of
cruelty
to
anything
but
my
pity
stirred
of
its
own
accord
at
the
sight
of
that
miserable
brute
in
the
treadmill
i
was
used
to
seeing
horses
and
abused
this
horse
had
no
load
to
make
him
sweat
and
i
never
saw
him
whipped
yet
i
pitied
this
creature
round
and
round
his
little
circle
he
trod
with
head
hanging
and
eyes
void
of
expectation
round
and
round
all
day
unthrilled
by
any
touch
of
rein
or
bridle
interpreters
of
a
living
will
round
and
round
all
solitary
never
driven
never
checked
never
addressed
round
and
round
and
round
a
walking
machine
with
eyes
that
did
not
flash
with
teeth
that
did
not
threaten
with
hoofs
that
did
not
strike
round
and
round
the
dull
day
long
i
knew
what
a
horse
life
should
be
entangled
with
the
life
of
a
master
adventurous
troubled
thrilled
petted
and
opposed
loved
and
abused
the
ringing
city
pavement
underfoot
and
the
buzz
of
beasts
and
men
in
the
market
place
the
yielding
turf
under
tickled
flanks
and
the
lone
whinny
of
scattered
mates
how
empty
the
existence
of
the
treadmill
horse
beside
this
as
empty
and
endless
and
dull
as
the
life
of
almost
any
woman
in
polotzk
had
i
had
eyes
to
see
the
likeness
but
to
my
ablutions
we
undress
in
a
room
leading
directly
from
the
entry
and
furnished
only
with
benches
around
the
walls
there
is
no
screen
or
other
protection
against
the
drafts
rushing
in
every
time
the
door
is
opened
when
we
enter
the
we
are
confused
by
a
babel
of
sounds
shrill
voices
of
women
hoarse
voices
of
attendants
wailing
and
yelping
of
children
and
rushing
of
water
at
the
same
time
we
are
smitten
by
the
heat
of
the
room
and
nearly
suffocated
by
clouds
of
steam
we
find
at
last
an
empty
bench
and
surround
ourselves
with
a
semicircle
of
wooden
pails
collected
from
all
around
the
room
sometimes
two
women
in
search
of
pails
lay
hold
of
the
same
pail
at
the
same
moment
and
a
wrangle
ensues
in
the
course
of
which
each
disputant
reminds
the
other
of
all
her
failings
nicknames
and
undesirable
connections
living
dead
and
unborn
until
an
attendant
interferes
with
more
muscle
than
argument
punctuating
the
sentence
of
justice
with
newly
coined
expletives
suggested
by
the
occasion
the
centre
of
the
room
where
the
bathers
fill
their
pails
at
the
faucets
is
a
field
of
endless
battle
especially
on
a
crowded
day
the
peaceful
women
seated
within
earshot
stop
their
violent
scrubbing
to
the
relief
of
unwilling
children
while
they
attend
to
the
liveliest
of
the
quarrels
i
like
to
watch
the
that
place
of
torture
and
heroic
endurance
it
is
a
series
of
steps
rising
to
the
ceiling
affording
a
gradually
mounting
temperature
the
bather
who
wants
to
enjoy
a
violent
sweating
rests
full
length
for
a
few
minutes
on
each
step
while
an
attendant
administers
several
hearty
strokes
of
a
stinging
besom
sometimes
a
woman
climbs
too
far
and
is
brought
down
in
a
faint
on
the
poll
also
the
cupping
is
done
the
back
of
the
patient
with
the
cups
in
even
rows
looks
to
me
like
a
muffin
pan
of
course
i
never
go
on
the
poll
i
am
not
robust
enough
my
spankings
i
take
at
home
another
centre
of
interest
is
the
the
name
of
which
it
is
indelicate
to
mention
in
the
hearing
of
men
it
is
a
large
pool
of
standing
water
its
depth
graded
by
means
of
a
flight
of
steps
every
married
woman
must
perform
here
certain
ceremonious
ablutions
at
regular
intervals
cleanliness
is
as
strictly
enjoined
as
godliness
and
the
manner
of
attaining
it
is
carefully
prescribed
the
women
are
prepared
by
the
attendants
for
entering
the
pool
the
curious
children
looking
on
in
the
pool
they
are
ducked
over
their
heads
the
correct
number
of
times
the
water
in
the
pool
has
been
standing
for
days
it
does
not
look
nor
smell
fresh
but
we
had
no
germs
in
polotzk
so
no
harm
came
of
it
any
more
than
of
the
pails
used
promiscuously
by
feminine
polotzk
if
any
were
so
dainty
as
to
have
second
thoughts
about
the
use
of
the
common
bath
they
could
enjoy
for
a
fee
of
kopecks
a
private
bathtub
in
another
part
of
the
building
for
the
rich
there
were
luxuries
even
in
polotzk
cleansed
and
steaming
we
return
at
last
to
the
to
shiver
as
we
dress
in
the
cold
drafts
from
the
entry
door
and
then
muffled
up
to
the
eyes
we
plunge
into
the
refreshing
outer
air
and
hurry
home
looking
like
so
many
big
bundles
running
away
with
smaller
bundles
if
we
meet
acquaintances
on
the
way
we
are
greeted
with
to
your
good
health
if
the
first
man
we
meet
is
a
gentile
the
women
who
have
been
to
the
mikweh
have
to
return
and
repeat
the
ceremony
of
purification
to
prevent
such
a
calamity
the
kerchief
is
worn
hooded
over
the
eyes
so
as
to
exclude
unholy
sights
at
home
we
are
indulged
with
extra
pieces
of
cake
for
tea
and
otherwise
treated
like
heroes
returned
from
victory
we
narrate
anecdotes
of
our
expedition
and
my
mother
complains
that
my
little
brother
is
getting
too
old
to
be
taken
to
the
women
bath
he
will
go
hereafter
with
the
men
illustration
the
meat
market
polotzk
my
winter
confinement
was
not
shared
by
my
older
sister
who
otherwise
was
my
constant
companion
she
went
out
more
than
i
not
being
so
afraid
of
the
cold
she
used
to
fret
so
when
my
mother
was
away
in
the
store
that
it
became
a
custom
for
her
to
accompany
my
mother
from
the
time
she
was
a
mere
baby
muffled
and
rosy
and
the
tears
of
cold
rolling
unnoticed
down
her
plump
cheeks
she
ran
after
my
busy
mother
all
day
long
or
tumbled
about
behind
the
counter
or
nestled
for
a
nap
among
the
bulging
sacks
of
oats
and
barley
she
warmed
her
little
hands
over
my
mother
pot
of
glowing
charcoal
there
was
no
stove
in
the
store
and
even
learned
to
stand
astride
of
it
for
further
comfort
without
setting
her
clothes
on
fire
fetchke
was
like
a
young
colt
inseparable
from
the
mare
i
make
this
comparison
not
in
disrespectful
jest
but
in
deepest
pity
fetchke
kept
close
to
my
mother
at
first
for
love
and
protection
but
the
petting
she
got
became
a
blind
for
discipline
she
learned
early
from
my
mother
example
that
hands
and
feet
and
brains
were
made
for
labor
she
learned
to
bow
to
the
yoke
to
lift
burdens
to
do
more
for
others
than
she
could
ever
hope
to
have
done
for
her
in
turn
she
learned
to
see
sugar
plums
lie
around
without
asking
for
her
share
when
she
was
only
fit
to
nurse
her
dolls
she
learned
how
to
comfort
a
weary
heart
and
all
this
while
i
sat
warm
and
watched
over
at
home
untouched
by
any
discipline
save
such
as
i
directly
incurred
by
my
own
sins
i
differed
from
fetchke
a
little
in
age
considerably
in
health
and
enormously
in
luck
it
was
my
good
luck
in
the
first
place
to
be
born
after
her
instead
of
before
in
the
second
place
to
inherit
from
the
family
stock
that
particular
assortment
of
gifts
which
was
sure
to
mark
me
for
special
attentions
exemptions
and
privileges
and
as
fortune
always
smiles
on
good
fortune
it
has
ever
been
my
luck
in
the
third
place
to
find
something
good
in
my
idle
hand
whether
a
sunbeam
or
a
loving
heart
or
a
congenial
task
whenever
on
turning
a
corner
i
put
out
my
hand
to
see
what
my
new
world
was
like
while
my
sister
dear
devoted
creature
had
her
hands
so
full
of
work
that
the
sunbeam
slipped
and
the
loving
comrade
passed
out
of
hearing
before
she
could
straighten
from
her
task
and
all
she
had
of
the
better
world
was
a
scented
zephyr
fanned
in
her
face
by
the
irresistible
closing
of
a
door
perhaps
esau
has
been
too
severely
blamed
for
selling
his
birthright
for
a
mess
of
pottage
the
lot
of
the
firstborn
is
not
necessarily
to
be
envied
the
firstborn
of
a
patriarch
like
isaac
or
of
a
rothschild
of
inherits
with
his
father
flocks
and
slaves
and
coffers
a
troop
of
cares
and
responsibilities
unless
he
be
a
man
without
a
sense
of
duty
in
which
case
we
are
not
supposed
to
envy
him
the
firstborn
of
an
indigent
father
inherits
a
double
measure
of
the
disadvantages
of
poverty
a
joyless
childhood
a
guideless
youth
and
perhaps
a
mateless
manhood
his
own
life
being
drained
to
feed
the
young
of
his
father
begetting
if
we
can
not
do
away
with
poverty
entirely
we
ought
at
least
to
abolish
the
institution
of
primogeniture
nature
invented
the
individual
and
promised
him
as
a
reward
for
lusty
being
comfort
and
immortality
comes
man
with
his
patented
brains
and
copyrighted
notions
and
levies
a
tax
on
the
individual
in
the
form
of
enforced
coöperation
for
the
maintenance
of
his
pet
institution
the
family
our
comfort
in
the
grip
of
this
tyranny
must
lie
in
the
hope
that
man
who
is
no
bastard
child
of
mother
nature
may
be
approaching
a
more
perfect
resemblance
to
her
majestic
features
that
his
fitful
development
will
culminate
in
a
spiritual
constitution
capable
of
absolute
justice
i
think
i
was
telling
how
i
stayed
at
home
in
the
winter
while
my
sister
helped
or
hindered
my
mother
in
her
the
days
drew
themselves
out
too
long
sometimes
so
that
i
sat
at
the
window
thinking
what
should
happen
next
no
dolls
no
books
no
games
and
at
times
no
companions
my
grandmother
taught
me
knitting
but
i
never
got
to
the
heel
of
my
stocking
because
if
i
discovered
a
dropped
stitch
i
insisted
on
unravelling
all
my
work
till
i
picked
it
up
and
grandmother
instead
of
encouraging
me
in
my
love
for
perfection
lost
patience
and
took
away
my
knitting
needles
i
still
maintain
that
she
was
in
the
wrong
but
i
have
forgiven
her
since
i
have
worn
many
pairs
of
stockings
with
dropped
stitches
and
been
grateful
for
them
and
speaking
of
such
everyday
things
reminds
me
of
my
friends
among
whom
also
i
find
an
impressive
number
with
a
stitch
dropped
somewhere
in
the
pattern
of
their
souls
i
love
these
friends
so
dearly
that
i
begin
to
think
i
am
at
last
shedding
my
intolerance
for
i
remember
the
day
when
i
could
not
love
less
than
perfection
i
and
my
imperfect
friends
together
aspire
to
cast
our
blemishes
and
i
am
happier
so
there
was
not
much
to
see
from
my
window
yet
adventures
beckoned
to
me
from
the
empty
street
sometimes
the
adventure
was
real
and
i
went
out
to
act
in
it
instead
of
dreaming
on
my
stool
once
i
remember
it
was
early
spring
and
the
winter
ice
just
chopped
up
by
the
street
cleaners
lay
muddy
and
ragged
and
high
in
the
streets
from
curb
to
curb
so
it
must
lie
till
there
was
time
to
cart
it
to
the
dvina
which
had
all
it
could
do
at
this
season
to
carry
tons
and
heavy
tons
of
ice
and
snow
and
every
sort
of
city
rubbish
accumulated
during
the
long
closed
months
polotzk
had
no
underground
communication
with
the
sea
save
such
as
water
naturally
makes
for
itself
the
poor
old
dvina
was
serving
both
as
and
sewer
as
a
bridge
in
winter
a
highway
in
summer
and
a
playground
at
all
times
so
it
served
us
right
if
we
had
to
wait
weeks
and
weeks
in
thawing
time
for
our
streets
to
be
cleared
and
we
deserved
all
the
sprains
and
bruises
we
suffered
from
clambering
over
the
broken
ice
in
the
streets
while
going
about
our
business
leah
the
short
little
and
straight
and
neat
with
a
basket
on
one
arm
and
a
bundle
under
the
other
stood
hesitating
on
the
edge
of
the
curb
opposite
my
window
her
poor
old
face
framed
in
its
calico
kerchief
had
a
wrinkle
of
anxiety
in
it
the
tumbled
ice
heap
in
the
street
looked
to
her
like
an
impassable
barrier
tiny
as
she
was
and
loaded
she
had
reason
to
hesitate
perhaps
she
had
eggs
in
her
basket
i
thought
of
that
as
i
looked
at
her
across
the
street
and
i
thought
of
my
old
ambition
to
measure
myself
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
leah
reputedly
short
i
was
small
myself
and
was
constantly
reminded
of
it
by
a
variety
of
nicknames
lovingly
or
vengefully
invented
by
my
friends
and
enemies
i
was
called
mouse
and
crumb
and
poppy
seed
should
i
live
to
be
called
in
my
old
age
mashke
the
short
i
longed
to
measure
my
stature
by
leah
and
here
was
my
chance
i
ran
out
into
the
street
my
grandmother
scolding
me
for
going
without
a
shawl
and
i
calling
back
to
her
to
be
sure
and
watch
me
i
skipped
over
the
ice
blocks
like
a
goat
and
offered
my
assistance
to
leah
the
short
with
admirable
skill
and
solicitude
i
guided
her
timid
steps
across
the
street
at
the
same
time
winking
to
my
grandmother
at
the
window
and
pointing
to
my
shoulder
close
to
leah
once
on
the
safe
sidewalk
the
tiny
woman
thanked
me
and
blessed
me
and
praised
me
for
a
thoughtful
child
and
i
watched
her
toddle
away
without
the
least
stir
of
shame
at
my
hypocrisy
she
had
convinced
me
that
i
was
a
good
little
girl
and
i
had
convinced
myself
that
i
was
not
so
very
short
my
chin
was
almost
on
a
level
with
leah
shoulder
and
i
had
years
ahead
in
which
to
elevate
it
grandma
at
the
window
was
witness
and
i
was
entirely
happy
if
i
caught
cold
from
going
bareheaded
so
much
the
better
mother
would
give
me
rock
candy
for
my
cough
for
the
long
winter
evenings
there
was
plenty
of
quiet
occupation
i
liked
to
sit
with
the
women
at
the
long
bare
table
picking
feathers
for
new
featherbeds
it
was
pleasant
to
poke
my
hand
into
the
mass
and
set
it
all
in
motion
i
pretended
that
i
could
pick
out
the
feathers
of
particular
hens
formerly
my
pets
i
reflected
that
they
had
fed
me
with
eggs
and
broth
and
now
were
going
to
make
my
bed
so
soft
while
i
had
done
nothing
for
them
but
throw
them
a
handful
of
oats
now
and
then
or
chase
them
about
or
spoil
their
nests
i
was
not
ashamed
of
my
part
i
knew
that
if
i
were
a
hen
i
should
do
as
a
hen
does
i
just
liked
to
think
about
things
in
my
idle
way
itke
the
housemaid
was
always
the
one
to
break
in
upon
my
reflections
she
was
sure
to
have
a
fit
of
sneezing
just
when
the
heap
on
the
table
was
highest
sending
clouds
of
feathers
into
the
air
like
a
homemade
snowstorm
after
that
the
evening
was
finished
by
our
picking
the
feathers
from
each
other
hair
sometimes
we
played
cards
or
checkers
munching
apples
between
moves
sometimes
the
women
sewed
and
we
children
wound
yarn
or
worsted
for
grandmother
knitting
if
somebody
had
a
story
to
tell
while
the
rest
worked
the
evening
passed
with
a
pleasant
sense
of
for
all
on
a
saturday
night
the
sabbath
being
just
departed
ghost
stories
were
particularly
in
favor
after
two
or
three
of
the
creepy
legends
we
began
to
move
closer
together
under
the
lamp
at
the
end
of
an
hour
or
so
we
started
and
screamed
if
a
spool
fell
or
a
window
rattled
at
bedtime
nobody
was
willing
to
make
the
round
of
doors
and
windows
and
we
were
afraid
to
bring
a
candle
into
a
dark
room
i
was
just
as
much
afraid
as
anybody
i
am
afraid
now
to
be
alone
in
the
house
at
night
i
certainly
was
afraid
that
saturday
night
when
somebody
in
bravado
suggested
buns
as
a
charm
to
dispel
the
ghosts
the
baker
who
lived
next
door
always
baked
on
saturday
night
who
would
go
and
fetch
the
buns
nobody
dared
to
venture
outdoors
it
had
snowed
all
evening
the
frosted
windows
prevented
a
preliminary
survey
of
the
silent
night
nobody
would
take
the
dare
nobody
but
me
oh
how
the
creeps
ran
up
and
down
my
back
and
oh
how
i
loved
to
distinguish
myself
i
let
them
bundle
me
up
till
i
was
nearly
smothered
i
paused
with
my
mittened
hand
on
the
latch
i
shivered
though
i
could
have
sat
the
night
out
with
a
polar
bear
without
another
shawl
i
opened
the
door
and
then
turned
back
to
make
a
speech
i
am
not
afraid
i
said
in
the
noble
accents
of
courage
i
am
not
afraid
to
go
god
goes
with
me
pride
goeth
before
a
fall
on
the
step
outside
i
slid
down
into
a
drift
just
on
the
eve
of
triumph
they
picked
me
up
they
brought
me
in
they
found
all
of
me
inside
my
wrappings
they
gave
me
a
piece
of
sugar
and
sent
me
to
bed
and
i
was
very
glad
i
did
hate
to
go
all
the
way
next
door
and
all
the
way
back
through
the
white
snow
under
the
white
stars
invisible
company
keeping
step
with
me
and
i
remember
my
playmates
there
was
always
a
crowd
of
us
girls
we
were
a
mixed
set
rich
little
girls
little
girls
and
poor
little
girls
but
not
because
we
were
so
democratic
rather
it
came
about
if
my
sister
and
i
are
considered
the
centre
of
the
ring
because
we
had
suffered
the
several
grades
of
fortune
in
our
best
days
no
little
girls
had
to
stoop
to
us
in
our
humbler
days
we
were
not
so
proud
that
we
had
to
condescend
to
our
chance
neighbors
the
granddaughters
of
raphael
the
russian
in
retaining
their
breeding
and
manners
retained
a
few
of
their
more
exalted
friends
and
became
a
link
between
them
and
those
whom
they
later
adopted
through
force
of
propinquity
we
were
human
little
girls
so
our
amusements
mimicked
the
life
about
us
we
played
house
we
played
soldiers
we
played
gentiles
we
celebrated
weddings
and
funerals
we
copied
the
life
about
us
literally
we
had
not
been
to
a
froebel
kindergarten
and
learned
to
impersonate
butterflies
and
stones
our
elders
would
have
laughed
at
us
for
such
nonsense
i
remember
once
standing
on
the
river
bank
with
a
little
boy
when
a
quantity
of
lumber
was
floating
down
on
its
way
to
the
distant
sawmill
a
log
and
a
board
crowded
each
other
near
where
we
stood
the
board
slipped
by
first
but
presently
it
swerved
and
swung
partly
around
then
it
righted
itself
with
the
stream
and
kept
straight
on
the
lazy
log
following
behind
said
zalmen
to
me
interpreting
the
board
looks
back
and
says
log
you
will
not
go
with
me
then
i
will
go
on
by
myself
that
boy
was
called
simple
on
account
of
such
speeches
as
this
i
wonder
in
what
language
he
is
writing
poetry
now
we
had
very
few
toys
neither
fetchke
nor
i
cared
much
for
dolls
a
rag
baby
apiece
contented
us
and
if
we
had
a
set
of
jackstones
we
were
perfectly
happy
our
jackstones
by
the
way
were
not
stones
but
bones
we
used
the
knuckle
bones
of
sheep
dried
and
scraped
every
little
girl
cherished
a
set
in
her
pocket
i
did
not
care
much
for
playing
house
i
liked
soldiers
better
but
it
was
not
much
fun
without
boys
boys
and
girls
always
played
apart
i
was
very
fond
of
playing
gentiles
i
am
afraid
i
liked
everything
that
was
a
little
risky
i
particularly
enjoyed
being
the
corpse
in
a
gentile
funeral
i
was
laid
across
two
chairs
and
my
playmates
in
borrowed
shawls
and
long
calicoes
with
their
hair
loose
and
with
candlesticks
in
their
hands
marched
around
me
singing
unearthly
songs
and
groaning
till
they
scared
themselves
as
i
lay
there
covered
over
with
a
black
cloth
i
felt
as
dead
as
dead
could
be
and
my
playmates
were
the
unholy
priests
in
gorgeous
robes
of
velvet
and
silk
and
gold
their
candlesticks
were
the
crosiers
that
were
carried
in
christian
funeral
processions
and
their
chantings
were
hideous
incantations
to
the
arch
enemy
the
christian
god
of
horrible
images
as
i
imagined
the
bareheaded
crowds
making
way
for
my
funeral
to
pass
my
flesh
crept
not
because
i
was
about
to
be
buried
but
because
the
people
but
our
procession
stopped
outside
the
church
because
we
did
not
dare
to
carry
even
our
across
that
accursed
threshold
besides
none
of
us
had
ever
been
inside
god
forbid
so
we
did
not
know
what
did
happen
next
when
i
arose
from
my
funeral
i
was
indeed
a
ghost
i
felt
unreal
and
lost
and
hateful
i
do
think
we
girls
liked
each
other
much
after
playing
funeral
anyway
we
never
played
any
more
on
the
same
day
or
if
we
did
we
soon
quarrelled
such
was
the
hold
which
our
hereditary
terrors
and
hatreds
had
upon
our
childish
minds
that
if
we
only
mocked
a
christian
procession
in
our
play
we
suffered
a
mutual
revulsion
of
feeling
as
if
we
had
led
each
other
into
sin
we
gathered
oftener
at
our
house
than
anywhere
else
on
sabbath
days
we
refrained
of
course
from
soldiering
and
the
like
but
we
had
just
as
good
a
time
going
off
to
promenade
two
and
two
in
our
very
best
dresses
whispering
secrets
and
telling
stories
we
had
a
few
stories
in
the
circle
i
do
not
know
how
they
came
to
us
and
these
were
told
over
and
over
gutke
knew
the
best
story
of
all
she
told
the
story
of
aladdin
and
the
wonderful
lamp
and
she
told
it
well
it
was
her
story
and
nobody
else
ever
attempted
it
though
i
for
one
soon
had
it
by
heart
gutke
version
of
the
famous
tale
was
unlike
any
i
have
since
read
but
it
was
essentially
the
story
of
aladdin
so
that
i
was
able
to
identify
it
later
when
i
found
it
in
a
book
names
incidents
and
local
color
were
slightly
hebraized
but
the
supernatural
wonders
of
treasure
caves
jewelled
gardens
genii
princesses
and
all
were
not
in
the
least
marred
or
diminished
gutke
would
spin
the
story
out
for
a
long
afternoon
and
we
all
listened
entranced
even
at
the
hundredth
rehearsal
we
had
a
few
other
fairy
stories
i
later
identified
them
with
stories
of
grimm
or
of
andersen
but
for
the
most
part
the
tales
we
told
were
sombre
and
unimaginative
tales
our
nurses
used
to
tell
to
frighten
us
into
good
behavior
sometimes
we
spent
a
whole
afternoon
in
dancing
we
made
our
own
music
singing
as
we
danced
or
somebody
blew
on
a
comb
with
a
bit
of
paper
over
its
teeth
and
comb
music
is
not
to
be
despised
when
there
is
no
other
sort
we
knew
the
polka
and
the
waltz
the
mazurka
the
quadrille
and
the
lancers
and
several
fancy
dances
we
did
not
hesitate
to
invent
new
steps
or
figures
and
we
never
stopped
till
we
were
out
of
breath
i
was
one
of
the
most
enthusiastic
dancers
i
danced
till
i
felt
as
if
i
could
fly
sometimes
we
sat
in
a
ring
and
sang
all
the
songs
we
knew
none
of
us
were
trained
we
had
never
seen
a
sheet
of
music
but
some
of
us
could
sing
any
tune
that
was
ever
heard
in
polotzk
and
the
others
followed
half
a
bar
behind
i
enjoyed
these
we
had
hebrew
songs
and
jewish
and
russian
solemn
songs
and
jolly
songs
and
songs
unfit
for
children
but
harmless
enough
on
our
innocent
lips
i
enjoyed
the
play
of
moods
in
these
songs
i
liked
to
be
harrowed
one
minute
and
tickled
the
next
i
threw
all
my
heart
into
the
singing
which
was
only
fair
as
i
had
very
little
voice
to
throw
in
although
i
always
joined
the
crowd
when
any
fun
was
on
foot
i
think
i
had
the
best
times
by
myself
my
sister
was
fond
of
housework
but
i
i
was
fond
of
idleness
while
fetchke
pottered
in
the
kitchen
beside
the
maid
or
trotted
all
about
the
house
after
my
grandmother
i
wasted
time
in
some
window
corner
or
studied
the
habits
of
the
cow
and
the
chickens
in
the
yard
i
always
found
something
to
do
that
was
of
no
use
to
anybody
i
had
no
particular
fondness
for
animals
i
liked
to
see
what
they
did
merely
because
they
were
curious
the
red
cow
would
go
to
meet
my
grandmother
as
she
came
out
of
the
kitchen
with
a
bucket
of
bran
for
her
she
drank
it
up
in
no
time
the
greedy
creature
in
great
loud
gulps
and
then
she
stood
with
dripping
nostrils
over
the
empty
bucket
staring
at
me
on
the
other
side
i
teased
grandmother
to
give
the
cow
more
because
i
enjoyed
her
enjoyment
of
it
i
wondered
if
i
ate
from
a
bucket
instead
of
a
plate
should
i
take
so
much
more
pleasure
in
my
dinner
that
red
cow
liked
everything
she
liked
going
to
pasture
and
she
liked
coming
back
and
she
stood
still
to
be
milked
as
if
she
liked
that
too
the
chickens
were
not
all
alike
some
of
them
would
not
let
me
catch
them
while
others
stood
still
till
i
took
them
up
there
were
two
that
were
particularly
tame
a
white
hen
and
a
speckled
one
in
winter
when
they
were
kept
in
the
house
my
sister
and
i
had
these
two
for
our
pets
they
let
us
handle
them
by
the
hour
and
stayed
just
where
we
put
them
the
white
hen
laid
her
eggs
in
a
linen
chest
made
of
bark
we
would
take
the
warm
egg
to
grandmother
who
rolled
it
on
our
eyes
repeating
this
charm
as
this
egg
is
fresh
so
may
your
eyes
be
fresh
as
this
egg
is
sound
so
may
your
eyes
be
sound
i
still
like
to
touch
my
eyelids
with
a
egg
whenever
i
am
so
happy
as
to
possess
one
on
the
horses
in
the
barn
i
bestowed
the
same
calm
attention
as
on
the
cow
speculative
rather
than
affectionate
i
was
not
a
very
infant
if
i
have
been
a
true
witness
of
my
own
growth
i
was
slower
to
love
than
i
was
to
think
i
do
not
know
when
the
change
was
wrought
but
if
you
ask
my
friends
they
will
tell
you
that
i
know
how
to
love
them
better
than
to
solve
their
problems
and
if
you
will
call
one
more
witness
and
ask
me
i
shall
say
that
if
you
set
me
down
before
a
noble
landscape
i
feel
it
long
before
i
begin
to
see
it
idle
child
though
i
was
the
day
was
not
long
enough
sometimes
for
my
idleness
more
than
once
in
the
pleasant
summer
i
stole
out
of
bed
when
even
the
cow
was
still
drowsing
and
went
barefoot
through
the
dripping
grass
and
stood
at
the
gate
awaiting
the
morning
i
found
a
sense
of
adventure
in
being
conscious
when
all
other
people
were
asleep
there
was
not
much
of
a
prospect
from
the
gateway
but
in
that
early
hour
everything
looked
new
and
large
to
me
even
the
little
houses
that
yesterday
had
been
so
familiar
the
houses
when
creatures
went
in
and
out
of
them
were
merely
conventional
objects
in
the
soft
gray
morning
they
were
themselves
creatures
some
stood
up
straight
and
some
leaned
and
some
looked
as
if
they
saw
me
and
then
over
the
dewy
gardens
rose
the
sun
and
the
light
spread
and
grew
over
everything
till
it
shone
on
my
bare
feet
and
in
my
heart
grew
a
great
wonder
and
i
was
ready
to
cry
my
world
was
so
strange
and
sweet
about
me
in
those
moments
i
think
i
could
have
loved
somebody
as
well
as
i
loved
later
somebody
who
cared
to
get
up
secretly
and
stand
and
see
the
sun
come
up
was
there
not
somebody
who
got
up
before
the
sun
was
there
not
mishka
the
shepherd
aye
that
was
an
early
riser
but
i
knew
he
was
no
before
the
chickens
stirred
before
the
lazy
maid
let
the
cow
out
of
the
barn
i
heard
his
rousing
horn
its
distant
notes
harmonious
with
the
morning
barn
doors
creaked
in
response
to
mishka
call
and
cattle
went
willingly
out
to
meet
him
and
stood
in
groups
in
the
empty
square
licking
and
nosing
each
other
till
mishka
little
drove
was
all
assembled
and
he
tramped
out
of
town
behind
them
in
a
cloud
of
dust
chapter
vi
the
tree
of
knowledge
history
shows
that
in
all
countries
where
jews
have
equal
rights
with
the
rest
of
the
people
they
lose
their
fear
of
secular
science
and
learn
how
to
take
their
ancient
religion
with
them
from
century
to
awakening
century
dropping
nothing
by
the
way
but
what
their
growing
spirit
has
outgrown
in
countries
where
progress
is
to
be
bought
only
at
the
price
of
apostasy
they
shut
themselves
up
in
their
synagogues
and
raise
the
wall
of
extreme
separateness
between
themselves
and
their
gentile
neighbors
there
is
never
a
jewish
community
without
its
scholars
but
where
jews
may
not
be
both
intellectuals
and
jews
they
prefer
to
remain
jews
the
survival
in
russia
of
mediæval
injustice
to
jews
was
responsible
for
the
narrowness
of
educational
standards
in
the
polotzk
of
my
time
jewish
scholarship
as
we
have
seen
was
confined
to
a
knowledge
of
the
hebrew
language
and
literature
and
even
these
limited
stores
of
learning
were
not
equally
divided
between
men
and
women
in
the
mediæval
position
of
the
women
of
polotzk
education
really
had
no
place
a
girl
was
finished
when
she
could
read
her
prayers
in
hebrew
following
the
meaning
by
the
aid
of
the
yiddish
translation
especially
prepared
for
women
if
she
could
sign
her
name
in
russian
do
a
little
figuring
and
write
a
letter
in
yiddish
to
the
parents
of
her
betrothed
she
was
called
well
educated
fortunately
for
me
my
parents
ideals
soared
beyond
all
this
my
mother
although
she
had
not
stirred
out
of
polotzk
readily
adopted
the
notion
of
a
liberal
education
imported
by
my
father
from
cities
beyond
the
pale
she
heartily
supported
him
in
all
his
plans
for
us
girls
fetchke
and
i
were
to
learn
to
translate
as
well
as
pronounce
hebrew
the
same
as
our
brother
we
were
to
study
russian
and
german
and
arithmetic
we
were
to
go
to
the
best
and
receive
a
thorough
secular
education
my
father
ambition
after
several
sojourn
in
enlightened
circles
reached
even
beyond
the
but
that
was
flying
farther
than
polotzk
could
follow
him
with
the
naked
eye
i
do
not
remember
our
first
teacher
when
our
second
teacher
came
we
were
already
able
to
read
continuous
passages
reb
lebe
was
no
great
scholar
great
scholars
would
not
waste
their
learning
on
mere
girls
reb
lebe
knew
enough
to
teach
girls
hebrew
tall
and
lean
was
the
rebbe
with
a
lean
pointed
face
and
a
thin
pointed
beard
the
beard
became
pointed
from
much
stroking
and
pulling
downwards
the
hands
of
reb
lebe
were
large
and
his
beard
was
not
half
a
handful
the
fingers
of
the
rebbe
were
long
and
the
nails
i
am
afraid
were
not
very
clean
the
coat
of
reb
lebe
was
rusty
and
so
was
his
remember
reb
lebe
was
only
a
girls
teacher
and
nobody
would
pay
much
for
teaching
girls
but
lean
and
rusty
as
he
was
the
pupils
regarded
him
with
entire
respect
and
followed
his
pointer
with
earnest
eyes
across
the
limp
page
of
the
alphabet
or
the
thumbed
page
of
the
for
a
short
time
my
sister
and
i
went
for
our
lessons
to
reb
heder
in
the
bare
room
off
the
women
gallery
up
one
flight
of
stairs
in
a
synagogue
the
place
was
as
noisy
as
a
reckless
expenditure
of
lung
power
could
make
it
the
pupils
on
the
bench
shouted
their
way
from
to
cheered
and
prompted
by
the
growl
of
the
rebbe
while
the
children
in
the
corridor
waiting
their
turn
played
puss
in
the
corner
and
other
noisy
games
fetchke
and
i
however
soon
began
to
have
our
lessons
in
private
at
our
own
home
we
sat
one
on
each
side
of
the
rebbe
reading
the
hebrew
sentences
turn
and
turn
about
when
we
left
off
reading
by
rote
and
reb
lebe
began
to
reveal
the
mysteries
to
us
i
was
so
eager
to
know
all
that
was
in
my
book
that
the
lesson
was
always
too
short
i
continued
reading
by
the
hour
after
the
rebbe
was
gone
though
i
understood
about
one
word
in
ten
my
favorite
hebrew
reading
was
the
psalms
verse
after
verse
i
chanted
to
the
monotonous
tune
taught
by
reb
lebe
rocking
to
the
rhythm
of
the
chant
just
like
the
rebbe
and
so
ran
the
song
of
david
and
so
ran
the
hours
by
while
i
sat
by
the
low
window
the
world
erased
from
my
consciousness
what
i
thought
i
do
not
remember
i
only
know
that
i
loved
the
sound
of
the
words
the
full
dense
solid
sound
of
them
to
the
meditative
chant
of
reb
lebe
i
pronounced
hebrew
very
well
and
i
caught
some
mechanical
trick
of
accent
and
emphasis
which
was
sufficiently
like
reb
lebe
to
make
my
reading
sound
intelligent
i
had
a
clue
to
the
general
mood
of
the
subject
from
the
few
psalms
i
had
actually
translated
and
drawing
on
my
imagination
for
details
i
was
able
to
read
with
so
much
spirit
that
ignorant
listeners
were
carried
away
by
my
performance
my
mother
tells
me
indeed
that
people
used
to
stop
outside
my
window
to
hear
me
read
of
this
i
have
not
the
slightest
recollection
so
i
suppose
i
was
an
unconscious
impostor
certain
i
am
that
i
thought
no
ignoble
thoughts
as
i
chanted
the
sacred
words
and
who
can
say
that
my
visions
were
not
as
inspiring
as
david
he
was
a
shepherd
before
he
became
a
king
i
was
an
ignorant
child
in
the
ghetto
but
i
was
admitted
at
last
to
the
society
of
the
best
i
was
given
the
freedom
of
all
america
perhaps
the
stuff
that
dreams
are
made
of
is
the
same
for
all
dreamers
when
we
came
to
read
genesis
i
had
the
great
advantage
of
a
complete
translation
in
yiddish
i
faithfully
studied
the
portion
assigned
in
hebrew
but
i
need
no
longer
wait
for
the
next
lesson
to
know
how
the
story
ends
i
could
read
while
daylight
lasted
if
i
chose
in
the
yiddish
well
i
remember
that
pentateuch
a
middling
thick
octavo
volume
in
a
crumbly
sort
of
leather
cover
and
how
the
book
opened
of
itself
at
certain
places
where
there
were
pictures
my
father
tells
me
that
when
i
was
just
learning
to
translate
single
words
he
found
me
one
evening
poring
over
the
and
made
fun
of
me
for
pretending
to
read
whereupon
i
gave
him
an
eager
account
he
says
of
the
stories
of
jacob
benjamin
moses
and
others
which
i
had
puzzled
out
from
the
pictures
by
the
help
of
a
word
here
and
there
that
i
was
able
to
translate
it
was
inevitable
as
we
came
to
genesis
that
i
should
ask
questions
rebbe
translating
in
the
beginning
god
created
the
earth
pupil
repeating
in
the
beginning
rebbe
when
was
the
beginning
rebbe
losing
the
place
in
amazement
a
ever
hear
such
a
question
the
beginning
was
the
beginning
the
beginning
was
in
the
beginning
of
course
nu
go
on
pupil
resuming
in
the
beginning
god
made
the
rebbe
what
did
he
make
it
out
of
rebbe
dropping
his
pointer
in
astonishment
what
did
what
sort
of
a
girl
is
this
that
asks
questions
go
on
go
on
the
lesson
continues
to
the
end
the
book
is
closed
the
pointer
put
away
the
rebbe
exchanges
his
for
his
street
cap
is
about
to
go
pupil
timidly
but
determinedly
detaining
him
reb
lebe
made
the
rebbe
regards
the
pupil
in
amazement
mixed
with
anxiety
his
emotion
is
beyond
speech
he
turns
and
leaves
the
room
in
his
perturbation
he
even
forgets
to
kiss
the
on
the
doorpost
the
pupil
feels
reproved
and
yet
somehow
in
the
right
who
make
god
but
if
the
rebbe
will
not
tell
will
not
tell
or
perhaps
he
does
not
know
the
rebbe
it
was
some
time
after
this
conflict
between
my
curiosity
and
his
obtuseness
that
i
saw
my
teacher
act
a
ridiculous
part
in
a
trifling
comedy
and
then
i
remember
no
more
of
him
reb
lebe
lingered
one
day
after
the
lesson
a
guest
who
was
about
to
depart
wishing
to
fortify
himself
for
his
journey
took
a
roll
of
hard
sausage
from
his
satchel
and
laid
it
with
his
clasp
knife
on
the
table
he
cut
himself
a
slice
and
ate
it
standing
and
then
noticing
the
thin
lean
rebbe
he
invited
him
by
a
gesture
to
help
himself
to
the
sausage
the
rebbe
put
his
hands
behind
his
coat
tails
declining
the
traveller
hospitality
the
traveller
forgot
the
other
and
walked
up
and
down
ready
in
his
fur
coat
and
cap
till
his
carriage
should
arrive
the
sausage
remained
on
the
table
thick
and
spicy
and
brown
no
such
sausage
was
known
in
polotzk
reb
lebe
looked
at
it
reb
lebe
continued
to
look
the
stranger
stopped
to
cut
another
slice
and
repeated
his
gesture
of
invitation
reb
lebe
moved
a
step
towards
the
table
but
his
hands
stuck
behind
his
coat
tails
the
traveller
resumed
his
walk
reb
lebe
moved
another
step
the
stranger
was
not
looking
the
rebbe
courage
rose
he
advanced
towards
the
table
he
stretched
out
his
hand
for
the
knife
at
that
instant
the
door
opened
the
carriage
was
announced
the
eager
traveller
without
noticing
reb
lebe
swept
up
sausage
and
knife
just
at
the
moment
when
the
timid
rebbe
was
about
to
cut
himself
a
delicious
slice
i
saw
his
discomfiture
from
my
corner
and
i
am
obliged
to
confess
that
i
enjoyed
it
his
face
always
looked
foolish
to
me
after
that
but
fortunately
for
us
both
we
did
not
study
together
much
longer
two
little
girls
dressed
in
their
best
shining
from
their
curls
to
their
shoes
one
little
girl
has
rosy
cheeks
the
other
has
staring
eyes
carries
a
carpet
bag
carries
a
new
slate
hand
in
hand
they
go
into
the
summer
morning
so
happy
and
pretty
a
pair
that
it
is
no
wonder
people
look
after
them
from
window
and
door
and
that
other
little
girls
not
dressed
in
their
best
and
carrying
no
carpet
bags
stand
in
the
street
gaping
after
them
let
the
folks
stare
no
harm
can
come
to
the
little
sisters
did
not
grandmother
tie
pepper
and
salt
into
the
corners
of
their
pockets
to
ward
off
the
evil
eye
the
little
maids
see
nothing
but
the
road
ahead
so
eager
are
they
upon
their
errand
carpet
bag
and
slate
proclaim
that
errand
and
are
going
to
school
i
have
no
words
to
describe
the
pride
with
which
my
sister
and
i
crossed
the
threshold
of
isaiah
the
scribe
hitherto
we
had
been
to
heder
to
a
rebbe
now
we
were
to
study
with
a
a
secular
teacher
there
was
all
the
difference
in
the
world
between
the
two
the
one
taught
you
hebrew
only
which
every
girl
learned
the
other
could
teach
yiddish
and
russian
and
some
said
even
german
and
how
to
write
a
letter
and
how
to
do
sums
without
a
just
on
a
piece
of
paper
accomplishments
which
were
extremely
rare
among
girls
in
polotzk
but
nothing
was
too
high
for
the
grandchildren
of
raphael
the
russian
they
had
good
heads
everybody
knew
so
we
were
sent
to
reb
isaiah
my
first
school
where
i
was
so
proud
to
be
received
was
a
hovel
on
the
edge
of
a
swamp
the
schoolroom
was
gray
within
and
without
the
door
was
so
low
that
reb
isaiah
had
to
stoop
in
passing
the
little
windows
were
murky
the
walls
were
bare
but
the
low
ceiling
was
decorated
with
bundles
of
goose
quills
stuck
in
under
the
rafters
a
rough
table
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
with
a
long
bench
on
either
side
that
was
the
schoolroom
complete
in
my
eyes
on
that
first
morning
it
shone
with
a
wonderful
light
a
strange
glory
that
penetrated
every
corner
and
made
the
stained
logs
fair
as
tinted
marble
and
the
windows
were
not
too
small
to
afford
me
a
view
of
a
large
new
world
room
was
made
for
the
new
pupils
on
the
bench
beside
the
teacher
we
found
our
inkwells
which
were
simply
hollows
scooped
out
in
the
thick
table
top
reb
isaiah
made
us
very
serviceable
pens
by
tying
the
pen
points
securely
to
little
twigs
though
some
of
the
pupils
used
quills
the
teacher
also
ruled
our
paper
for
us
into
little
squares
like
a
surveyor
notebook
then
he
set
us
a
copy
and
we
copied
one
letter
in
each
square
all
the
way
down
the
page
all
the
little
girls
and
the
girls
and
the
pretty
big
girls
copied
letters
in
little
squares
just
so
there
were
so
few
of
us
that
reb
isaiah
could
see
everybody
page
by
just
leaning
over
and
if
some
of
our
cramped
fingers
were
clumsy
and
did
not
form
the
loops
and
curves
accurately
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
stretch
out
his
hand
and
rap
with
his
ruler
on
our
respective
knuckles
it
was
all
very
cosey
with
the
inkwells
that
could
not
be
upset
and
the
pens
that
grew
in
the
woods
or
strutted
in
the
dooryard
and
the
teacher
in
the
closest
touch
with
his
pupils
as
i
have
just
told
and
as
he
labored
with
us
and
the
hours
drew
themselves
out
he
was
comforted
by
the
smell
of
his
dinner
cooking
in
some
little
hole
adjoining
the
schoolroom
and
by
the
sound
of
his
good
leah
or
rachel
or
deborah
i
do
remember
her
name
keeping
order
among
his
little
ones
she
kept
very
good
order
too
so
that
most
of
the
time
you
could
hear
the
scratching
of
the
laborious
pens
accompanied
by
the
croaking
of
the
frogs
in
the
swamp
although
my
sister
and
i
began
our
studies
at
the
same
time
and
progressed
together
my
parents
did
not
want
me
to
take
up
new
subjects
as
fast
as
fetchke
did
they
thought
my
health
too
delicate
for
much
study
so
when
fetchke
had
her
russian
lesson
i
was
told
to
go
and
play
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
i
was
disobedient
on
these
occasions
as
on
many
others
i
did
not
go
and
play
i
looked
on
i
listened
when
fetchke
rehearsed
her
lesson
at
home
and
one
evening
i
stole
the
russian
primer
and
repaired
to
a
secret
place
i
knew
of
it
was
a
storeroom
for
broken
chairs
and
rusty
utensils
and
dried
apples
nobody
would
look
for
me
in
that
dusty
hole
nobody
did
look
there
but
they
looked
everywhere
else
in
the
house
and
in
the
yard
and
in
the
barn
and
down
the
street
and
at
our
neighbors
and
while
everybody
was
searching
and
calling
for
me
and
telling
each
other
when
i
was
last
seen
and
what
i
was
then
doing
i
mashke
was
bending
over
the
stolen
book
rehearsing
a
b
c
by
the
names
my
sister
had
given
them
and
before
anybody
hit
upon
my
retreat
i
could
spell
god
and
goat
i
did
not
mind
in
the
least
being
caught
for
i
had
my
new
accomplishment
to
show
off
i
remember
the
littered
place
and
the
high
chest
that
served
as
my
table
and
the
blue
glass
lamp
that
lighted
my
secret
efforts
i
remember
being
brought
from
there
into
the
firelit
room
where
the
family
was
assembled
and
confusing
them
all
by
my
recital
of
the
simple
words
and
i
was
not
reproached
for
going
into
hiding
at
bedtime
and
the
next
day
i
was
allowed
to
take
part
in
the
russian
lesson
alas
there
were
not
many
lessons
more
long
before
we
had
exhausted
reb
isaiah
learning
my
sister
and
i
had
to
give
up
our
teacher
because
the
family
fortunes
began
to
decline
and
luxuries
such
as
schooling
had
to
be
cut
off
isaiah
the
scribe
taught
us
in
all
perhaps
two
terms
in
which
time
we
learned
yiddish
and
russian
and
a
little
arithmetic
but
little
good
we
had
from
our
ability
to
read
for
there
were
no
books
in
our
house
except
and
other
religious
writings
mostly
in
hebrew
for
our
skill
in
writing
we
had
as
little
use
as
was
not
an
everyday
exercise
and
idle
writing
was
not
thought
of
our
good
teacher
however
who
had
taken
pride
in
our
progress
would
not
let
us
lose
all
that
we
had
learned
from
him
books
he
could
not
lend
us
because
he
had
none
himself
but
he
could
and
he
did
write
us
out
a
beautiful
copy
apiece
which
we
could
repeat
over
and
over
from
time
to
time
and
so
keep
our
hands
in
i
wonder
that
i
have
forgotten
the
graceful
sentences
of
my
copy
for
i
wrote
them
out
just
about
countless
times
it
was
in
the
form
of
a
letter
written
on
lovely
pink
paper
my
sister
was
blue
the
lines
taking
the
shape
of
semicircles
across
the
page
and
that
without
any
guide
lines
showing
the
script
of
course
was
perfect
in
the
best
manner
of
isaiah
the
scribe
and
the
sentiments
therein
expressed
were
entirely
noble
i
was
supposed
to
be
a
pupil
away
on
my
vacation
and
i
was
writing
to
my
respected
parents
to
assure
them
of
my
welfare
and
to
tell
them
how
in
the
midst
of
my
pleasures
i
still
longed
for
my
friends
and
looked
forward
with
eagerness
to
the
renewal
of
my
studies
all
this
in
phrases
half
yiddish
half
german
and
altogether
foreign
to
the
ears
of
polotzk
at
least
i
never
heard
such
talk
in
the
market
when
i
went
to
buy
a
kopeck
worth
of
sunflower
seeds
this
was
all
the
schooling
i
had
in
russia
my
father
plans
fell
to
the
ground
on
account
of
the
protracted
illness
of
both
my
parents
all
his
hopes
of
leading
his
children
beyond
the
intellectual
limits
of
polotzk
were
trampled
down
by
the
monster
poverty
who
showed
his
evil
visage
just
as
my
sister
and
i
were
fairly
started
on
a
broader
path
one
chance
we
had
and
that
was
quickly
snatched
away
of
continuing
our
education
in
spite
of
family
difficulties
lozhe
the
rav
hearing
from
various
sources
that
pinchus
of
raphael
the
russian
had
two
bright
little
girls
whose
talents
were
going
to
waste
for
want
of
training
became
much
interested
and
sent
for
the
children
to
see
for
himself
what
the
gossip
was
worth
by
a
strange
trick
of
memory
i
recall
nothing
of
this
important
interview
nor
indeed
of
the
whole
matter
although
a
thousand
trifles
of
that
period
recur
to
me
on
the
instant
so
i
report
this
anecdote
on
the
authority
of
my
parents
they
tell
me
how
the
rav
lifted
me
up
on
a
table
in
front
of
him
and
asked
me
many
questions
and
encouraged
me
to
ask
questions
in
my
turn
reb
lozhe
came
to
the
conclusion
as
a
result
of
this
interview
that
i
ought
by
all
means
to
be
put
to
school
there
was
no
public
school
for
girls
as
we
know
but
a
few
pupils
were
maintained
in
a
certain
private
school
by
irregular
contributions
from
city
funds
reb
lozhe
enlisted
in
my
cause
the
influence
of
his
son
who
by
virtue
of
some
municipal
office
which
he
held
had
a
vote
in
fixing
this
appropriation
but
although
he
pleaded
eloquently
for
my
admission
as
a
city
pupil
the
rav
son
failed
to
win
the
consent
of
his
colleagues
and
my
one
little
crack
of
opportunity
was
tightly
stopped
my
father
does
not
remember
on
what
technicality
my
application
was
dismissed
my
mother
is
under
the
impression
that
it
was
plainly
refused
on
account
of
my
religion
the
authorities
being
unwilling
to
appropriate
money
for
the
tuition
of
a
jewish
child
but
little
it
matters
now
what
the
reason
was
the
result
is
what
affected
me
i
was
left
without
teacher
or
book
just
when
my
mind
was
most
active
i
was
left
without
food
just
when
the
hunger
of
growth
was
creeping
up
i
was
left
to
think
and
think
without
direction
without
the
means
of
grappling
with
the
contents
of
my
own
thought
in
a
community
which
was
isolated
from
the
mass
of
the
people
on
account
of
its
religion
which
was
governed
by
special
civil
laws
in
recognition
of
that
fact
in
whose
calendar
there
were
twoscore
days
of
religious
observance
whose
going
and
coming
giving
and
taking
living
and
dying
to
the
minutest
details
of
social
conduct
to
the
most
intimate
particulars
of
private
life
were
regulated
by
sacred
laws
there
could
be
no
question
of
personal
convictions
in
religion
one
was
a
jew
leading
a
righteous
life
or
one
was
a
gentile
existing
to
harass
the
jews
while
making
a
living
off
jewish
enterprise
in
the
vocabulary
of
the
more
intelligent
part
of
polotzk
it
is
true
there
were
such
words
as
freethinker
and
apostate
but
these
were
the
names
of
men
who
had
forsaken
the
law
in
distant
times
or
in
distant
parts
and
whose
evil
fame
had
reached
polotzk
by
the
circuitous
route
of
tradition
nobody
looked
for
such
monsters
in
his
neighborhood
polotzk
was
safely
divided
into
jews
and
gentiles
if
any
one
in
polotzk
had
been
idle
and
curious
enough
to
inquire
into
the
state
of
mind
of
a
little
child
i
wonder
if
his
findings
would
not
have
disturbed
this
simple
classification
there
used
to
be
a
little
girl
in
polotzk
who
recited
the
long
hebrew
prayers
morning
and
evening
before
and
after
meals
and
never
skipped
a
word
who
kissed
the
when
going
or
coming
who
abstained
from
food
and
drink
on
fast
days
when
she
was
no
bigger
than
a
sacrificial
hen
who
spent
sabbath
mornings
over
the
lengthy
ritual
for
the
day
and
read
the
psalms
till
daylight
failed
this
pious
child
could
give
as
good
an
account
of
the
creation
as
any
boy
of
her
age
she
knew
how
god
made
the
world
undeterred
by
the
fate
of
eve
she
wanted
to
know
more
she
asked
her
wise
rebbe
how
god
came
to
be
in
his
place
and
where
he
found
the
stuff
to
make
the
world
of
and
what
was
doing
in
the
universe
before
god
undertook
his
task
finding
from
his
unsatisfying
replies
that
the
rebbe
was
but
a
barren
branch
on
the
tree
of
knowledge
the
good
little
girl
never
betrayed
to
the
world
by
look
or
word
her
discovery
of
his
limitations
but
continued
to
accord
him
outwardly
all
the
courtesy
due
to
his
calling
her
teacher
having
failed
her
the
young
student
with
admirable
persistence
carried
her
questions
from
one
to
another
of
her
acquaintances
putting
their
answers
to
the
test
whenever
it
was
possible
she
established
by
this
means
two
facts
first
that
she
knew
as
much
as
any
of
those
who
undertook
to
instruct
her
second
that
her
oracles
sometimes
gave
false
answers
did
the
little
inquisitor
charge
her
betrayers
with
the
lie
magnanimous
creature
she
kept
their
falseness
a
secret
and
ceased
to
probe
their
shallow
depths
what
you
would
know
find
out
for
yourself
this
became
our
motto
and
she
passed
from
the
question
to
the
experiment
her
grandmother
told
her
that
if
she
handled
blind
flowers
she
would
be
stricken
blind
she
found
by
test
that
the
pretty
flowers
were
harmless
she
tested
everything
that
could
be
tested
till
she
hit
at
last
on
an
impious
plan
to
put
god
himself
to
the
proof
the
pious
little
girl
arose
one
sabbath
afternoon
from
her
religious
meditations
when
all
the
house
was
taking
its
nap
and
went
out
in
the
yard
and
stopped
at
the
gate
she
took
out
her
pocket
handkerchief
she
looked
at
it
yes
that
would
do
for
the
experiment
she
put
it
back
into
her
pocket
she
did
not
have
to
rehearse
mentally
the
sacred
admonition
not
to
carry
anything
beyond
the
on
the
sabbath
day
she
knew
it
as
she
knew
that
she
was
alive
and
with
her
handkerchief
in
her
pocket
the
audacious
child
stepped
into
the
street
she
stood
a
moment
her
heart
beating
so
that
it
pained
nothing
happened
she
walked
quite
across
the
street
the
sabbath
peace
still
lay
on
everything
she
felt
again
of
the
burden
in
her
pocket
yes
she
certainly
was
committing
a
sin
with
an
access
of
impious
boldness
the
sinner
walked
she
ran
as
far
as
the
corner
and
stood
still
fearfully
expectant
what
form
would
the
punishment
take
she
stood
breathing
painfully
for
an
eternity
how
still
everything
was
how
close
and
still
the
air
would
it
be
a
storm
would
a
sudden
bolt
strike
her
she
stood
and
waited
she
could
not
bring
her
hand
to
her
pocket
again
but
she
felt
that
it
bulged
monstrously
she
stood
with
no
thought
of
moving
again
where
were
the
thunders
of
jehovah
no
sacred
word
of
all
her
long
prayers
came
to
her
tongue
not
even
hear
o
israel
she
felt
that
she
was
in
direct
communication
with
god
awful
thought
and
he
would
read
her
mind
and
would
send
his
answer
illustration
sabbath
loaves
for
sale
bread
market
polotzk
an
age
passed
in
blank
expectancy
nothing
happened
where
was
the
wrath
of
god
was
god
when
she
turned
to
go
home
the
little
philosopher
had
her
handkerchief
tied
around
her
wrist
in
the
proper
way
the
experiment
was
over
though
the
result
was
not
clear
god
had
not
punished
her
but
nothing
was
proved
by
his
indifference
either
the
act
was
no
sin
and
her
preceptors
were
all
deceivers
or
it
was
indeed
a
sin
in
the
eyes
of
god
but
he
refrained
from
stern
justice
for
high
reasons
of
his
own
it
was
not
a
searching
experiment
she
had
made
she
was
bitterly
disappointed
and
perhaps
that
was
meant
as
her
punishment
god
refused
to
give
her
a
reply
she
intended
no
sin
for
the
sake
of
sin
so
being
still
in
doubt
she
tied
her
handkerchief
around
her
wrist
her
eyes
stared
more
than
ever
this
was
the
child
with
the
staring
eyes
but
that
was
the
only
sign
she
gave
of
a
consciousness
suddenly
expanded
of
a
intensified
when
she
went
back
into
the
house
she
gazed
with
a
new
curiosity
at
her
mother
at
her
grandmother
dozing
in
their
chairs
they
looked
when
they
awoke
and
stretched
themselves
and
adjusted
wig
and
cap
they
looked
strange
as
she
went
to
get
her
grandmother
her
bible
and
dropped
it
accidentally
she
kissed
it
by
way
of
atonement
just
as
a
proper
child
should
how
i
wonder
would
this
child
have
be
enlabelled
by
the
investigator
of
her
mind
would
he
have
called
her
a
jew
she
was
too
young
to
be
called
an
apostate
perhaps
she
would
have
been
dismissed
as
a
little
fraud
and
i
should
be
content
with
that
classification
if
slightly
modified
i
should
say
the
child
was
a
piteously
puzzled
little
fraud
to
return
to
the
honest
first
person
i
something
of
a
fraud
the
days
when
i
believed
everything
i
was
told
did
not
run
much
beyond
my
teething
time
i
soon
began
to
question
if
fire
was
really
hot
if
the
cat
would
really
scratch
presently
as
we
have
seen
i
questioned
god
and
in
those
days
my
religion
depended
on
my
mood
i
could
believe
anything
i
wanted
to
believe
i
did
believe
in
all
my
moods
that
there
was
a
god
who
had
made
the
world
in
some
fashion
unexplained
and
who
knew
about
me
and
my
doings
for
there
was
the
world
all
about
me
and
somebody
must
have
made
it
and
it
was
conceivable
that
a
being
powerful
enough
to
do
such
work
could
be
aware
of
my
actions
at
all
times
and
yet
continue
to
me
invisible
the
question
remained
what
did
he
think
of
my
conduct
was
he
really
angry
when
i
broke
the
sabbath
or
pleased
when
i
fasted
on
the
day
of
atonement
my
belief
as
to
these
matters
wavered
when
i
swung
the
sacrifice
around
my
head
on
atonement
eve
repeating
be
thou
my
sacrifice
i
certainly
believed
that
i
was
bargaining
with
the
almighty
for
pardon
and
that
he
was
interested
in
the
matter
but
next
day
when
the
fast
was
over
and
i
enjoyed
all
of
my
chicken
that
i
could
eat
i
believed
as
certainly
that
god
could
not
be
party
to
such
a
foolish
transaction
in
which
he
got
nothing
but
words
while
i
got
both
the
feast
and
the
pardon
the
sacrifice
of
money
to
be
spent
for
the
poor
seemed
to
me
a
more
reliable
insurance
against
damnation
the
pious
offered
up
both
living
sacrifice
and
money
for
the
but
it
was
a
sign
of
poverty
to
offer
only
money
even
a
lean
rooster
to
be
killed
roasted
and
garnished
for
the
devotee
own
table
at
the
breaking
of
the
fast
seemed
to
be
considered
a
more
respectable
sacrifice
than
a
groschen
to
increase
the
charity
fund
all
this
was
so
illogical
that
it
unsettled
my
faith
in
minor
points
of
doctrine
and
on
these
points
i
was
quite
happy
to
believe
one
thing
another
as
unwaveringly
as
i
believed
that
we
jews
had
a
god
who
was
powerful
and
wise
i
believed
that
the
god
of
my
christian
neighbors
was
impotent
cruel
and
foolish
i
understood
that
the
god
of
the
gentiles
was
no
better
than
a
toy
to
be
dressed
up
in
gaudy
stuffs
and
carried
in
processions
i
saw
it
often
enough
and
turned
away
in
contempt
while
the
god
of
abraham
isaac
and
jacob
my
god
enjoined
on
me
honesty
and
kindness
the
god
of
vanka
bade
him
beat
me
and
spit
on
me
whenever
he
caught
me
alone
and
what
a
foolish
god
was
that
who
taught
the
stupid
gentiles
that
we
drank
the
blood
of
a
murdered
child
at
our
passover
feast
why
i
who
was
only
a
child
knew
better
and
so
i
hated
and
feared
and
avoided
the
great
white
church
in
the
platz
and
hated
every
sign
and
symbol
of
that
monstrous
god
who
was
kept
there
and
hated
my
own
person
when
in
our
play
of
a
christian
funeral
i
imagined
my
body
to
be
the
corpse
over
which
was
carried
the
hideous
cross
perhaps
i
have
established
that
i
was
more
jew
than
gentile
though
i
can
still
prove
that
i
was
none
the
less
a
fraud
for
instance
i
remember
how
once
on
the
eve
of
the
ninth
of
ab
the
anniversary
of
the
fall
of
the
temple
i
was
looking
on
at
the
lamentations
of
the
women
a
large
circle
had
gathered
around
my
mother
who
was
the
only
good
reader
among
them
to
listen
to
the
story
of
the
cruel
destruction
sitting
on
humble
stools
in
stocking
feet
shabby
clothes
and
dishevelled
hair
weeping
in
chorus
and
wringing
their
hands
as
if
it
was
but
yesterday
that
the
sacred
edifice
fell
and
they
were
in
the
very
dust
and
ashes
of
the
ruin
the
women
looked
to
me
enviously
wretched
and
pious
i
joined
the
circle
in
the
candlelight
i
wrung
my
hands
i
moaned
but
i
was
always
slow
of
tears
i
could
not
weep
but
i
wanted
to
look
like
the
others
so
i
streaked
my
cheeks
with
the
only
moisture
at
hand
alas
for
my
pious
ambition
alas
for
the
noble
lament
of
the
women
somebody
looked
up
and
caught
me
in
the
act
of
manufacturing
tears
i
grinned
and
she
giggled
another
woman
looked
up
i
grinned
and
they
giggled
demoralization
swept
around
the
circle
honest
laughter
snuffed
out
artificial
grief
my
mother
at
last
looked
up
with
red
and
astonished
eyes
and
i
was
banished
from
the
feast
of
tears
i
returned
promptly
to
my
playmates
in
the
street
who
were
amusing
themselves
according
to
the
custom
on
that
sad
anniversary
by
pelting
each
other
with
burrs
here
i
was
distinguished
more
than
i
had
been
among
my
elders
my
hair
being
curly
it
caught
a
generous
number
of
burrs
so
that
i
fairly
bristled
with
these
emblems
of
mortification
and
woe
not
long
after
that
sinful
experiment
with
the
handkerchief
i
discovered
by
accident
that
i
was
not
the
only
doubter
in
polotzk
one
friday
night
i
lay
wakeful
in
my
little
bed
staring
from
the
dark
into
the
lighted
room
adjoining
mine
i
saw
the
sabbath
candles
sputter
and
go
out
one
by
one
it
was
late
but
the
lamp
hanging
from
the
ceiling
still
burned
high
everybody
had
gone
to
bed
the
lamp
would
go
out
before
morning
if
there
was
little
oil
or
else
it
would
burn
till
natasha
the
gentile
chorewoman
came
in
the
morning
to
put
it
out
and
remove
the
candlesticks
from
the
table
and
unseal
the
oven
and
do
the
dozen
little
tasks
which
no
jew
could
perform
on
the
sabbath
the
simple
prohibition
to
labor
on
the
sabbath
day
had
been
construed
by
zealous
commentators
to
mean
much
more
one
must
not
even
touch
any
instrument
of
labor
or
commerce
as
an
axe
or
a
coin
it
was
forbidden
to
light
a
fire
or
to
touch
anything
that
contained
a
fire
or
had
contained
fire
were
it
only
a
cold
candlestick
or
a
burned
match
therefore
the
lamp
at
which
i
was
staring
must
burn
till
the
gentile
woman
came
to
put
it
out
the
light
did
not
annoy
me
in
the
least
i
was
not
thinking
about
it
but
apparently
it
troubled
somebody
else
i
saw
my
father
come
from
his
room
which
also
adjoined
the
what
was
he
going
to
do
what
was
this
he
was
doing
could
i
believe
my
eyes
my
father
touched
the
lighted
lamp
yes
he
shook
it
as
if
to
see
how
much
oil
there
was
left
i
was
petrified
in
my
place
i
could
neither
move
nor
make
a
sound
it
seemed
to
me
he
must
feel
my
eyes
bulging
at
him
out
of
the
dark
but
he
did
not
know
that
i
was
looking
he
thought
everybody
was
asleep
he
turned
down
the
light
a
very
little
and
waited
i
did
not
take
my
eyes
from
him
he
lowered
the
flame
a
little
more
and
waited
again
i
watched
by
the
slightest
degrees
he
turned
the
light
down
i
understood
in
case
any
one
were
awake
it
would
appear
as
if
the
lamp
was
going
out
of
itself
i
was
the
only
one
who
lay
so
as
to
be
able
to
see
him
and
i
had
gone
to
bed
so
early
that
he
could
not
suppose
i
was
awake
the
light
annoyed
him
he
wanted
to
put
it
out
but
he
would
not
risk
having
it
known
i
heard
my
father
find
his
bed
in
the
dark
before
i
dared
to
draw
a
full
breath
the
thing
he
had
done
was
a
monstrous
sin
if
his
mother
had
seen
him
do
it
it
would
have
broken
her
heart
his
mother
who
fasted
half
the
days
of
the
year
when
he
was
a
boy
to
save
his
teacher
fee
his
mother
who
walked
almost
barefoot
in
the
cruel
snow
to
carry
him
on
her
shoulders
to
school
when
she
had
no
shoes
for
him
his
mother
who
made
it
her
pious
pride
to
raise
up
a
learned
son
that
most
precious
offering
in
the
eyes
of
the
great
god
from
the
hand
of
a
poor
struggling
woman
if
my
mother
had
seen
it
it
would
have
grieved
her
no
less
my
mother
who
was
given
to
him
with
her
youth
and
good
name
and
her
dowry
in
exchange
for
his
learning
and
piety
my
mother
who
was
taken
from
her
play
to
bear
him
children
and
feed
them
and
keep
them
while
he
sat
on
the
benches
of
the
scholars
and
repaid
her
labors
with
the
fame
of
his
learning
i
did
not
put
it
to
myself
just
so
but
i
understood
that
learning
and
piety
were
the
things
most
valued
in
our
family
that
my
father
was
a
scholar
and
that
piety
of
course
was
the
fruit
of
sacred
learning
and
yet
my
father
had
deliberately
violated
the
sabbath
his
act
was
not
to
be
compared
with
my
carrying
the
handkerchief
the
two
sins
were
of
the
same
kind
but
the
sinners
and
their
motives
were
different
i
was
a
child
a
girl
at
that
not
yet
of
the
age
of
moral
responsibility
he
was
a
man
full
grown
passing
for
one
of
elect
and
accepting
the
reverence
of
the
world
as
due
tribute
to
his
scholarly
merits
i
had
by
no
means
satisfied
myself
by
my
secret
experiment
that
it
was
not
sinful
to
carry
a
burden
on
the
sabbath
day
if
god
did
not
punish
me
on
the
spot
perhaps
it
was
because
of
my
youth
or
perhaps
it
was
because
of
my
motive
according
to
my
elders
my
father
by
turning
out
the
lamp
committed
the
sin
of
what
did
my
father
intend
i
could
not
suppose
that
his
purpose
was
similar
to
mine
surely
he
who
had
lived
so
long
and
studied
so
deeply
had
by
this
time
resolved
all
his
doubts
surely
god
had
instructed
i
could
not
believe
that
he
did
wrong
knowingly
so
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
did
not
hold
it
a
sin
to
touch
a
lighted
lamp
on
sabbath
then
why
was
he
so
secret
in
his
action
that
too
became
clear
to
me
i
myself
had
instinctively
adopted
secret
methods
in
all
my
little
investigations
and
had
kept
the
results
to
myself
the
way
in
which
my
questions
were
received
had
taught
me
much
i
had
a
dim
inarticulate
understanding
of
the
horror
and
indignation
which
my
father
would
excite
if
he
supposedly
a
man
of
piety
should
publish
the
heretical
opinion
that
it
was
not
wrong
to
handle
fire
on
the
sabbath
to
see
what
remorse
my
mother
suffered
or
my
father
mother
if
by
some
accident
she
failed
in
any
point
of
religious
observance
was
to
know
that
she
could
never
be
brought
to
doubt
the
sacred
importance
of
the
thousand
minutiæ
of
ancient
jewish
practice
that
which
had
been
taught
them
as
the
truth
by
their
fathers
and
mothers
was
the
whole
truth
to
my
good
friends
and
neighbors
that
and
nothing
else
if
there
were
any
people
in
polotzk
who
had
strange
private
opinions
such
as
i
concluded
my
father
must
hold
it
was
possible
that
he
had
a
secret
acquaintance
with
them
but
it
would
never
do
it
was
plain
to
me
to
make
public
confession
of
his
convictions
such
an
act
would
not
only
break
the
hearts
of
his
family
but
it
would
also
take
the
bread
from
the
mouths
of
his
children
and
ruin
them
forever
my
sister
and
my
brother
and
i
would
come
to
be
called
the
children
of
israel
the
apostate
just
as
gutke
my
playmate
was
called
the
granddaughter
of
yankel
the
informer
the
most
innocent
of
us
would
be
cursed
and
shunned
for
the
sin
of
our
father
all
this
i
came
to
understand
not
all
at
once
but
by
degrees
as
i
put
this
and
that
together
and
brought
my
childish
thoughts
to
order
i
was
by
no
means
absorbed
in
this
problem
i
played
and
danced
with
the
other
children
as
heartily
as
ever
but
i
brooded
in
my
window
corner
when
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
i
had
not
the
slightest
impulse
to
go
to
my
father
charge
him
with
his
unorthodox
conduct
and
demand
an
explanation
of
him
i
was
quite
satisfied
that
i
understood
him
and
i
had
not
the
habit
of
confidences
i
was
still
in
the
days
when
i
was
content
to
things
and
did
not
long
to
communicate
my
discoveries
moreover
i
was
used
to
living
in
two
worlds
a
real
world
and
a
one
without
ever
knowing
which
was
which
in
one
world
i
had
much
company
father
and
mother
and
sister
and
friends
and
did
as
others
did
and
took
everything
for
granted
in
the
other
world
i
was
all
alone
and
i
had
to
discover
ways
for
myself
and
i
was
so
uncertain
that
i
did
not
attempt
to
bring
a
companion
along
and
did
i
find
my
own
father
treading
in
the
unknown
ways
then
perhaps
some
day
he
would
come
across
me
and
take
me
farther
than
i
had
yet
been
but
i
would
not
be
the
first
to
whisper
that
i
was
there
it
seems
strange
enough
to
me
now
that
i
should
have
been
so
uncommunicative
but
i
remind
myself
that
i
have
been
thoroughly
made
over
at
least
once
since
those
early
days
i
recall
with
sorrow
that
i
was
sometimes
as
weak
in
morals
as
i
was
in
religion
i
remember
stealing
a
piece
of
sugar
it
was
long
ago
almost
as
long
ago
as
anything
that
i
remember
we
were
still
living
in
my
grandfather
house
when
this
dreadful
thing
happened
and
i
was
only
four
or
five
years
old
when
we
moved
from
there
before
my
mother
figured
this
out
for
me
i
scarcely
had
the
courage
to
confess
my
sin
and
it
was
thus
in
a
corner
of
a
front
room
by
a
window
stood
a
high
chest
of
drawers
on
top
of
the
chest
stood
a
tin
box
decorated
with
figures
of
queer
people
with
queer
flat
parasols
a
chinese
in
a
word
the
box
had
a
lid
the
lid
was
shut
tight
but
i
knew
what
was
in
that
gorgeous
box
and
i
coveted
it
i
was
very
little
i
never
could
reach
anything
there
stood
a
chair
suggestively
near
the
chest
i
pushed
the
chair
a
little
and
mounted
it
by
standing
on
tiptoe
i
could
now
reach
the
box
i
opened
it
and
took
out
an
irregular
lump
of
sparkling
sugar
i
stood
on
the
chair
admiring
it
i
stood
too
long
my
grandmother
came
in
or
was
it
itke
the
housemaid
and
found
me
with
the
stolen
morsel
i
saw
that
i
was
fairly
caught
how
could
i
hope
to
escape
my
captor
when
i
was
obliged
to
turn
on
my
stomach
in
order
to
descend
safely
thus
presenting
my
jailer
with
the
most
tempting
opportunity
for
immediate
chastisement
i
took
in
the
situation
before
my
grandmother
had
found
her
voice
for
horror
did
i
rub
my
eyes
with
my
knuckles
and
whimper
i
wish
i
could
report
that
i
was
thus
instantly
struck
with
a
sense
of
my
guilt
i
was
impressed
only
with
the
absolute
certainty
of
my
impending
doom
and
i
promptly
seized
on
a
measure
of
compensation
while
my
captor
i
really
think
it
was
a
grandmother
rehearsed
her
entire
vocabulary
of
reproach
from
a
distance
sufficient
to
enable
her
to
hurl
her
voice
at
me
with
the
best
effect
i
stuffed
the
lump
of
sugar
into
my
mouth
and
munched
it
as
fast
as
i
could
and
i
had
eaten
it
all
and
had
licked
my
sticky
lips
before
the
avenging
rod
came
down
i
remember
no
similar
lapses
from
righteousness
but
i
sinned
in
lesser
ways
more
times
than
there
are
years
in
my
life
i
sinned
and
more
than
once
i
escaped
punishment
by
some
trick
or
sly
speech
i
do
not
mean
that
i
lied
outright
though
that
also
i
did
sometimes
but
i
would
twist
my
naughty
speech
if
forced
to
repeat
it
in
such
an
artful
manner
or
give
such
ludicrous
explanation
of
my
naughty
act
that
justice
was
overcome
by
laughter
and
threw
me
as
often
as
not
a
handful
of
raisins
instead
of
a
knotted
strap
if
by
such
successes
i
was
encouraged
to
cultivate
my
natural
slyness
and
duplicity
i
throw
the
blame
on
my
unwise
preceptors
and
am
glad
to
be
rid
of
the
burden
for
once
i
have
said
that
i
used
to
lie
i
recall
no
particular
occasion
when
a
lie
was
the
cause
of
my
disgrace
but
i
know
that
it
was
always
my
habit
when
i
had
some
trifling
adventure
to
report
to
garnish
it
up
with
so
much
detail
and
circumstance
that
nobody
who
had
witnessed
my
small
affair
could
have
recognized
it
as
the
same
had
i
not
insisted
on
my
version
with
such
fervid
conviction
the
truth
is
that
everything
that
happened
to
me
really
loomed
great
and
shone
splendid
in
my
eyes
and
i
could
not
except
by
conscious
effort
reduce
my
visions
to
their
actual
shapes
and
colors
if
i
saw
a
pair
of
geese
leading
about
a
lazy
goose
girl
they
went
through
all
sorts
of
antics
before
my
eyes
that
fat
geese
are
not
known
to
indulge
in
if
i
met
poor
blind
munye
with
a
frown
on
his
face
i
thought
that
a
cloud
of
wrath
overspread
his
countenance
and
i
ran
home
to
relate
panting
how
narrowly
i
had
escaped
his
fury
i
will
not
pretend
that
i
was
absolutely
unconscious
of
my
exaggerations
but
if
you
insist
i
will
say
that
things
as
i
reported
them
might
have
been
so
and
would
have
been
much
more
interesting
had
they
been
so
the
noble
reader
who
never
told
a
lie
or
never
confessed
one
will
be
shocked
at
these
revelations
of
my
childish
depravity
what
proof
has
he
he
will
cry
that
i
am
not
lying
on
every
page
of
this
chronicle
if
by
my
own
confession
my
childhood
was
spent
in
a
maze
of
lies
and
dreams
i
shall
say
to
the
saint
when
i
am
challenged
that
the
proof
of
my
conversion
to
veracity
is
engraven
in
his
own
soul
do
you
not
remember
you
spotless
one
how
you
used
to
steal
and
lie
and
cheat
and
rob
oh
not
with
your
own
hand
of
course
it
was
your
remote
ancestor
who
lived
by
plunder
and
was
honored
for
the
blood
upon
his
hairy
hands
by
and
by
he
discovered
that
cunning
was
more
effective
than
violence
and
less
troublesome
still
later
he
became
convinced
that
the
greatest
cunning
was
virtue
and
made
him
a
moral
code
and
subdued
the
world
then
when
you
came
along
stumbling
through
the
wilderness
of
errors
your
wise
ancestor
gave
you
a
thrust
that
landed
you
in
the
clearing
of
modernity
at
the
same
time
bellowing
in
your
ear
now
be
good
it
pays
this
is
the
whole
history
of
your
saintliness
but
all
people
do
not
take
up
life
at
the
same
point
of
human
development
some
are
backward
at
birth
and
have
to
make
up
in
the
brief
space
of
their
individual
history
the
stages
they
missed
on
their
way
out
of
the
black
past
with
me
for
example
it
actually
comes
to
this
that
i
have
to
recapitulate
in
my
own
experience
all
the
slow
steps
of
the
progress
of
the
race
i
seem
to
learn
nothing
except
by
the
prick
of
life
on
my
own
skin
i
am
saved
from
living
in
ignorance
and
dying
in
darkness
only
by
the
sensitiveness
of
my
skin
some
men
learn
through
borrowed
experience
shut
them
up
in
a
glass
tower
with
an
unobstructed
view
of
the
world
and
they
will
go
through
every
adventure
of
life
by
proxy
and
be
able
to
furnish
you
with
a
complete
philosophy
of
life
and
you
may
safely
bring
up
your
children
by
it
but
i
am
not
of
that
godlike
organization
i
am
a
thinking
animal
things
are
as
important
to
me
as
ideas
i
imbibe
wisdom
through
every
pore
of
my
body
there
are
times
indeed
when
the
doctor
in
his
study
is
less
intelligible
to
me
than
a
cricket
far
off
in
the
field
the
earth

my
mother
the
earth
is
my
teacher
i
am
a
dutiful
pupil
i
listen
ever
with
my
ear
close
to
her
lips
it
seems
to
me
i
do
not
know
a
single
thing
that
i
did
not
learn
more
or
less
directly
through
the
corporal
senses
as
long
as
i
have
my
body
i
need
not

the
boundaries
stretch
the
long
chapter
of
troubles
which
led
to
my
father
emigration
to
america
began
with
his
own
illness
the
doctors
sent
him
to
courland
to
consult
expensive
specialists
who
prescribed
tedious
courses
of
treatment
he
was
far
from
cured
when
my
mother
also
fell
ill
and
my
father
had
to
return
to
polotzk
to
look
after
the
business
trouble
begets
trouble
after
my
mother
took
to
her
bed
everything
continued
to
go
wrong
the
business
gradually
declined
as
too
much
money
was
withdrawn
to
pay
the
doctors
and
apothecaries
bills
and
my
father
himself
in
poor
health
and
worried
about
my
mother
was
not
successful
in
coping
with
the
growing
difficulties
at
home
the
servants
were
dismissed
for
the
sake
of
economy
and
all
the
housework
and
the
nursing
fell
on
my
grandmother
and
my
sister
fetchke
as
a
result
was
overworked
and
fell
ill
of
a
fever
the
baby
suffering
from
unavoidable
neglect
developed
the
fractious
temper
of
and
by
way
of
a
climax
the
old
cow
took
it
into
her
head
to
kick
my
grandmother
who
was
laid
up
for
a
week
with
a
bruised
leg
neighbors
and
cousins
pulled
us
through
till
grandma
got
up
and
after
her
fetchke
but
my
mother
remained
on
her
bed
weeks
months
a
year
she
lay
there
and
half
of
another
year
all
the
doctors
in
polotzk
attended
her
in
turn
and
one
doctor
came
all
the
way
from
vitebsk
every
country
practitioner
for
miles
around
was
consulted
every
quack
every
old
wife
who
knew
a
charm
the
apothecaries
ransacked
their
shops
for
drugs
the
names
of
which
they
had
forgotten
and
kind
neighbors
brought
in
their
favorite
remedies
there
were
midnight
prayers
in
the
synagogue
for
my
mother
and
petitions
at
the
graves
of
her
parents
and
one
awful
night
when
she
was
near
death
three
pious
mothers
who
had
never
lost
a
child
came
to
my
mother
bedside
and
bought
her
for
a
few
kopecks
for
their
own
so
that
she
might
gain
the
protection
of
their
luck
and
so
be
saved
still
my
poor
mother
lay
on
her
bed
suffering
and
wasting
the
house
assumed
a
look
of
desolation
everybody
went
on
tiptoe
we
talked
in
whispers
for
weeks
at
a
time
there
was
no
laughter
in
our
home
the
ominous
night
lamp
was
never
extinguished
we
slept
in
our
clothes
night
after
night
so
as
to
wake
the
more
easily
in
case
of
sudden
need
we
watched
we
waited
but
we
scarcely
hoped
once
in
a
while
i
was
allowed
to
take
a
short
turn
in
the
it
was
awful
to
sit
beside
my
mother
bed
in
the
still
night
and
see
her
helplessness
she
had
been
so
strong
so
active
she
used
to
lift
sacks
and
barrels
that
were
heavy
for
a
man
and
now
she
could
not
raise
a
spoon
to
her
mouth
sometimes
she
did
not
know
me
when
i
gave
her
the
medicine
and
when
she
knew
me
she
did
not
care
would
she
ever
care
any
more
she
looked
strange
and
small
in
the
shadows
of
the
bed
her
hair
had
been
cut
off
after
the
first
few
months
her
short
curls
were
almost
covered
by
the
ice
bag
her
cheeks
were
red
red
but
her
hands
were
so
white
as
they
had
never
been
before
in
the
still
night
i
wondered
if
she
cared
to
live
the
night
lamp
burned
on
my
father
grew
old
he
was
always
figuring
on
a
piece
of
paper
we
children
knew
the
till
was
empty
when
the
silver
candlesticks
were
taken
away
to
be
pawned
next
superfluous
featherbeds
were
sold
for
what
they
would
bring
and
then
there
came
a
day
when
grandma
with
eyes
blinded
by
tears
groped
in
the
big
wardrobe
for
my
mother
satin
dress
and
velvet
mantle
and
after
that
it
did
not
matter
any
more
what
was
taken
out
of
the
house
then
everything
took
a
sudden
turn
my
mother
began
to
improve
and
at
the
same
time
my
father
was
offered
a
good
position
as
superintendent
of
a
gristmill
as
soon
as
my
mother
could
be
moved
he
took
us
all
out
to
the
mill
about
three
versts
out
of
town
on
the
polota
we
had
a
pleasant
cottage
there
with
the
miller
freckled
family
for
our
only
neighbors
if
our
rooms
were
barer
than
they
used
to
be
the
sun
shone
in
at
all
the
windows
and
as
the
leaves
on
the
trees
grew
denser
and
darker
my
mother
grew
stronger
on
her
feet
and
laughter
returned
to
our
house
as
the
song
bird
to
the
grove
we
children
had
a
very
happy
summer
we
had
never
lived
in
the
country
before
and
we
liked
the
change
it
was
endless
fun
to
explore
the
mill
to
squeeze
into
forbidden
places
and
be
pulled
out
by
the
angry
miller
to
tyrannize
over
the
mill
hands
and
be
worshipped
by
them
in
return
to
go
boating
on
the
river
and
discover
unvisited
nooks
and
search
the
woods
and
fields
for
kitchen
herbs
and
get
lost
and
be
found
a
hundred
times
a
week
and
what
an
adventure
it
was
to
walk
the
three
versts
into
town
leaving
a
trail
of
perfume
from
the
posies
we
carried
to
our
city
friends
but
these
things
did
not
last
the
mill
changed
hands
and
the
new
owner
put
a
protégé
of
his
own
in
my
father
place
so
after
a
short
breathing
spell
we
were
driven
back
into
the
swamp
of
growing
poverty
and
trouble
the
next
year
or
so
my
father
spent
in
a
restless
and
fruitless
search
for
a
permanent
position
my
mother
had
another
serious
illness
and
his
own
health
remained
precarious
what
he
earned
did
not
more
than
half
pay
the
bills
in
the
end
though
we
were
living
very
humbly
now
polotzk
seemed
to
reject
him
and
no
other
place
invited
him
just
at
this
time
occurred
one
of
the
periodic
movements
whereby
government
officials
were
wont
to
clear
the
forbidden
cities
of
jews
whom
in
the
intervals
of
slack
administration
of
the
law
they
allowed
to
maintain
an
illegal
residence
in
places
outside
the
pale
on
payment
of
enormous
bribes
and
at
the
cost
of
nameless
risks
and
indignities
it
was
a
little
before
passover
that
the
cry
of
the
hunted
thrilled
the
jewish
world
with
the
familiar
fear
the
wholesale
expulsion
of
jews
from
moscow
and
its
surrounding
district
at
cruelly
short
notice
was
the
name
of
this
latest
disaster
where
would
the
doom
strike
next
the
jews
who
lived
illegally
without
the
pale
turned
their
possessions
into
cash
and
slept
in
their
clothes
ready
for
immediate
flight
those
who
lived
in
the
comparative
security
of
the
pale
trembled
for
their
brothers
and
sisters
without
and
opened
wide
their
doors
to
afford
the
fugitives
refuge
and
hundreds
of
fugitives
preceded
by
a
wail
of
distress
flocked
into
the
open
district
bringing
their
trouble
where
trouble
was
never
absent
mingling
their
tears
with
the
tears
that
never
dried
the
open
cities
becoming
thus
suddenly
crowded
every
man
chance
of
making
a
living
was
diminished
in
proportion
to
the
number
of
additional
competitors
hardship
acute
distress
ruin
for
many
thus
spread
the
disaster
ring
beyond
ring
from
the
stone
thrown
by
a
despotic
official
into
the
river
of
jewish
persecution
passover
was
celebrated
in
tears
that
year
in
the
story
of
the
exodus
we
would
have
read
a
chapter
of
current
history
only
for
us
there
was
no
deliverer
and
no
promised
land
but
what
said
some
of
us
at
the
end
of
the
long
service
not
may
we
be
next
year
in
jerusalem
but
next
year
in
america
so
there
was
our
promised
land
and
many
faces
were
turned
towards
the
west
and
if
the
waters
of
the
atlantic
did
not
part
for
them
the
wanderers
rode
its
bitter
flood
by
a
miracle
as
great
as
any
the
rod
of
moses
ever
wrought
my
father
was
carried
away
by
the
westward
movement
glad
of
his
own
deliverance
but
sore
at
heart
for
us
whom
he
left
behind
it
was
the
last
chance
for
all
of
us
we
were
so
far
reduced
in
circumstances
that
he
had
to
travel
with
borrowed
money
to
a
german
port
whence
he
was
forwarded
to
boston
with
a
host
of
others
at
the
expense
of
an
emigrant
aid
society
i
was
about
ten
years
old
when
my
father
emigrated
i
was
used
to
his
going
away
from
home
and
america
did
not
mean
much
more
to
me
than
kherson
or
odessa
or
any
other
names
of
distant
places
i
understood
vaguely
from
the
gravity
with
which
his
plans
were
discussed
and
from
references
to
ships
societies
and
other
unfamiliar
things
that
this
enterprise
was
different
from
previous
ones
but
my
excitement
and
emotion
on
the
morning
of
my
departure
were
mainly
vicarious
i
know
the
day
when
america
as
a
world
entirely
unlike
polotzk
lodged
in
my
brain
to
become
the
centre
of
all
my
dreams
and
speculations
well
i
know
the
day
i
was
in
bed
sharing
the
measles
with
some
of
the
other
children
mother
brought
us
a
thick
letter
from
father
written
just
before
boarding
the
ship
the
letter
was
full
of
excitement
there
was
something
in
it
besides
the
description
of
travel
something
besides
the
pictures
of
crowds
of
people
of
foreign
cities
of
a
ship
ready
to
put
out
to
sea
my
father
was
travelling
at
the
expense
of
a
charitable
organization
without
means
of
his
own
without
plans
to
a
strange
world
where
he
had
no
friends
and
yet
he
wrote
with
the
confidence
of
a
soldier
going
into
battle
the
rhetoric
is
mine
father
simply
wrote
that
the
emigration
committee
was
taking
good
care
of
everybody
that
the
weather
was
fine
and
the
ship
comfortable
but
i
heard
something
as
we
read
the
letter
together
in
the
darkened
room
that
was
more
than
the
words
seemed
to
say
there
was
an
elation
a
hint
of
triumph
such
as
had
never
been
in
my
father
letters
before
i
can
not
tell
how
i
knew
it
i
felt
a
stirring
a
straining
in
my
father
letter
it
was
there
even
though
my
mother
stumbled
over
strange
words
even
though
she
cried
as
women
will
when
somebody
is
going
away
my
father
was
inspired
by
a
vision
he
saw
something
he
promised
us
something
it
was
this
america
and
america
became
my
dream
while
it
was
nothing
new
for
my
father
to
go
far
from
home
in
search
of
his
fortune
the
circumstances
in
which
he
left
us
were
unlike
anything
we
had
experienced
before
we
had
absolutely
no
reliable
source
of
income
no
settled
home
no
immediate
prospects
we
hardly
knew
where
we
belonged
in
the
simple
scheme
of
our
society
my
mother
as
a
had
nothing
like
her
former
success
her
health
was
permanently
impaired
her
place
in
the
business
world
had
long
been
filled
by
others
and
there
was
no
capital
to
start
her
anew
her
brothers
did
what
they
could
for
her
they
were
but
they
all
had
large
families
with
marriageable
daughters
and
sons
to
be
bought
out
of
military
service
the
allowance
they
made
her
was
generous
compared
to
their
means
affection
and
duty
could
do
no
more
but
there
were
four
of
us
growing
children
and
my
mother
was
obliged
to
make
every
effort
within
her
power
to
piece
out
her
income
how
quickly
we
came
down
from
a
large
establishment
with
servants
and
retainers
and
a
place
among
the
best
in
polotzk
to
a
single
room
hired
by
the
week
and
the
humblest
associations
and
the
averted
heads
of
former
friends
but
oftenest
it
was
my
mother
who
turned
away
her
head
she
took
to
using
the
side
streets
to
avoid
the
pitiful
eyes
of
the
kind
and
the
scornful
eyes
of
the
haughty
both
were
turned
on
her
as
she
trudged
from
store
to
store
and
from
house
to
house
peddling
tea
or
other
ware
and
both
were
hard
to
bear
many
a
winter
morning
she
arose
in
the
dark
to
tramp
three
or
four
miles
in
the
gripping
cold
through
the
dragging
snow
with
a
pound
of
tea
for
a
distant
customer
and
her
profit
was
perhaps
twenty
kopecks
many
a
time
she
fell
on
the
ice
as
she
climbed
the
steep
bank
on
the
far
side
of
the
dvina
a
heavy
basket
on
each
arm
more
than
once
she
fainted
at
the
doors
of
her
customers
ashamed
to
knock
as
suppliant
where
she
had
used
to
be
received
as
an
honored
guest
i
hope
the
angels
did
not
have
to
count
the
tears
that
fell
on
her
aching
hands
as
she
counted
her
bitter
earnings
at
night
and
who
took
care
of
us
children
while
my
mother
tramped
the
streets
with
her
basket
why
who
but
fetchke
who
but
the
little
housewife
of
twelve
sure
of
our
safety
was
my
mother
with
fetchke
to
watch
sure
of
our
comfort
with
fetchke
to
cook
the
soup
and
divide
the
scrap
of
meat
and
remember
the
next
meal
joseph
was
in
heder
all
day
the
baby
was
a
quiet
little
thing
mashke
was
no
worse
than
usual
but
still
there
was
plenty
to
do
with
order
to
keep
in
a
crowded
room
and
the
washing
and
the
mending
and
fetchke
did
it
all
she
went
to
the
river
with
the
women
to
wash
the
clothes
and
tucked
up
her
dress
and
stood
in
the
water
like
the
rest
of
them
and
beat
and
rubbed
with
all
her
might
till
our
miserable
rags
gleamed
white
again
and
i
i
usually
had
a
cold
or
a
cough
or
something
to
disable
me
and
i
never
had
any
talent
for
housework
if
i
swept
and
sanded
the
floor
polished
the
samovar
and
ran
errands
i
was
doing
much
i
minded
the
baby
who
did
not
need
much
minding
i
was
willing
enough
i
suppose
but
the
hard
things
were
done
without
my
help
not
that
i
mean
to
belittle
the
part
that
i
played
in
our
reduced
domestic
economy
indeed
i
am
very
particular
to
get
all
the
credit
due
me
i
always
remind
my
sister
deborah
who
was
the
baby
of
those
humble
days
that
it
was
i
who
pierced
her
ears
earrings
were
a
requisite
part
of
a
girl
toilet
even
a
beggar
girl
must
have
earrings
were
they
only
loops
of
thread
with
glass
beads
i
heard
my
mother
bemoan
the
baby
because
she
had
not
time
to
pierce
her
ears
promptly
i
armed
myself
with
a
coarse
needle
and
a
spool
of
thread
and
towed
deborah
out
into
the
woodshed
the
operation
was
entirely
successful
though
the
baby
was
entirely
ungrateful
and
i
am
proud
to
this
day
of
the
unflinching
manner
in
which
i
did
what
i
conceived
to
be
my
duty
if
deborah
chooses
to
go
with
ungarnished
ears
it
is
her
affair
my
conscience
is
free
of
all
reproach
illustration
winter
scene
on
the
dvina
i
had
a
direct
way
in
everything
i
rushed
right
in
i
spoke
right
out
my
mother
sent
me
sometimes
to
deliver
a
package
of
tea
and
i
was
proud
to
help
in
business
one
day
i
went
across
the
dvina
and
far
up
the
other
side
it
was
a
expedition
for
me
to
make
alone
and
i
was
not
a
little
pleased
with
myself
when
i
delivered
my
package
safe
and
intact
into
the
hands
of
my
customer
but
the
storekeeper
was
not
pleased
at
all
she
sniffed
and
sniffed
she
pinched
the
tea
she
shook
it
all
out
on
the
counter
take
it
back
she
said
in
disgust
this
is
not
the
tea
i
always
buy
it
a
poorer
quality
i
knew
the
woman
was
mistaken
i
was
acquainted
with
my
several
grades
of
tea
so
i
spoke
up
manfully
oh
no
i
said
this
is
the
tea
my
mother
always
sends
you
there
is
no
worse
tea
nothing
in
my
life
ever
hurt
me
more
than
that
woman
answer
to
my
argument
she
laughed
she
simply
laughed
but
i
understood
even
before
she
controlled
herself
sufficiently
to
make
verbal
remarks
that
i
had
spoken
like
a
fool
had
lost
my
mother
a
customer
i
had
only
spoken
the
truth
but
i
had
not
expressed
it
diplomatically
that
was
no
way
to
make
business
i
felt
very
sore
to
be
returning
home
with
the
tea
still
in
my
hand
but
i
forgot
my
trouble
in
watching
a
summer
storm
gather
up
the
river
the
few
passengers
who
took
the
boat
with
me
looked
scared
as
the
sky
darkened
and
the
boatman
grasped
his
oars
very
soberly
it
took
my
breath
away
to
see
the
signs
but
i
liked
it
and
i
was
much
disappointed
to
get
home
dry
when
my
mother
heard
of
my
misadventure
she
laughed
too
but
that
was
different
and
i
was
able
to
laugh
with
her
this
is
the
way
i
helped
in
the
housekeeping
and
in
business
i
hope
it
does
not
appear
as
if
i
did
not
take
our
situation
to
heart
for
i
did
in
my
own
fashion
it
was
plain
even
to
an
idle
dreamer
like
me
that
we
were
living
on
the
charity
of
our
friends
and
barely
living
at
that
it
was
plain
from
my
father
letters
that
he
was
scarcely
able
to
support
himself
in
america
and
that
there
was
no
immediate
prospect
of
our
joining
him
i
realized
it
all
but
i
considered
it
temporary
and
i
found
plenty
of
comfort
in
writing
long
letters
to
my
father
real
original
letters
this
time
not
copies
of
reb
model
letters
which
my
father
treasured
for
years
as
an
instance
of
what
i
mean
by
my
own
fashion
of
taking
trouble
to
heart
i
recall
the
day
when
our
household
effects
were
attached
for
a
debt
we
had
plenty
of
debts
but
the
stern
creditor
who
set
the
law
on
us
this
time
was
none
of
ours
the
claim
was
against
a
family
to
whom
my
mother
sublet
two
of
our
three
rooms
furnished
with
her
own
things
the
police
officers
who
swooped
down
upon
us
without
warning
as
was
their
habit
asked
no
questions
and
paid
no
heed
to
explanations
they
affixed
a
seal
to
every
lame
chair
and
cracked
pitcher
in
the
place
aye
to
every
faded
petticoat
found
hanging
in
the
wardrobe
these
goods
comprising
all
our
possessions
and
all
our
tenant
would
presently
be
removed
to
be
sold
at
auction
for
the
benefit
of
the
creditor
lame
chairs
and
faded
petticoats
when
they
are
the
last
one
has
have
a
vital
value
in
the
owner
eyes
my
mother
moved
about
weeping
distractedly
all
the
while
the
officers
were
in
the
house
the
frightened
children
cried
our
neighbors
gathered
to
bemoan
our
misfortune
and
over
everything
was
the
peculiar
dread
which
only
jews
in
russia
feel
when
agents
of
the
government
invade
their
homes
the
fear
of
the
moment
was
in
my
heart
as
in
every
other
heart
there
it
was
a
horrid
oppressive
fear
i
retired
to
a
quiet
corner
to
grapple
with
it
i
was
not
given
to
weeping
but
i
must
think
things
out
in
words
i
repeated
to
myself
that
the
trouble
was
all
about
money
somebody
wanted
money
from
our
tenant
who
had
none
to
give
our
furniture
was
going
to
be
sold
to
make
this
money
it
was
a
mistake
but
then
the
officers
would
not
believe
my
mother
still
it
was
only
about
money
nobody
was
dead
nobody
was
ill
it
was
all
about
why
there
was
plenty
of
money
in
polotzk
my
own
uncle
had
many
times
as
much
as
the
creditor
claimed
he
could
buy
all
our
things
back
or
somebody
else
could
what
did
it
matter
it
was
only
and
money
was
got
by
working
and
we
were
all
willing
to
work
there
was
nothing
gone
nothing
lost
as
when
somebody
died
this
furniture
could
be
moved
from
place
to
place
and
so
could
money
be
moved
and
nothing
was
lost
out
of
the
world
by
the
transfer
was
all
if
anybody
why
what
do
i
see
at
the
window
breine
malke
our
neighbor
is
yes
she
is
smuggling
something
out
of
the
window
if
she
is
caught
oh
i
must
help
breine
malke
beckons
she
wants
me
to
do
something
i
see
i
understand
i
must
stand
in
the
doorway
to
obstruct
the
view
of
the
officers
who
are
all
engaged
in
the
next
room
just
now
i
move
readily
to
my
post
but
i
can
not
resist
my
curiosity
i
must
look
over
my
shoulder
a
last
time
to
see
what
it
is
breine
malke
wants
to
smuggle
out
i
can
scarcely
stifle
my
laughter
of
all
our
earthly
goods
our
neighbor
has
chosen
for
salvation
a
dented
bandbox
containing
a
bonnet
from
my
mother
happier
days
and
i
laugh
not
only
from
amusement
but
also
from
lightness
of
heart
for
i
have
succeeded
in
reducing
our
catastrophe
to
its
simplest
terms
and
i
find
that
it
is
only
a
trifle
and
no
matter
of
life
and
death
i
could
not
help
it
that
was
the
way
it
looked
to
me
i
am
sure
i
made
as
serious
efforts
as
anybody
to
prepare
myself
for
life
in
america
on
the
lines
indicated
in
my
father
letters
in
america
he
wrote
it
was
no
disgrace
to
work
at
a
trade
workmen
and
capitalists
were
equal
the
employer
addressed
the
employee
as
not
familiarly
as
the
cobbler
and
the
teacher
had
the
same
title
mister
and
all
the
children
boys
and
girls
jews
and
gentiles
went
to
school
education
would
be
ours
for
the
asking
and
economic
independence
also
as
soon
as
we
were
prepared
he
wanted
fetchke
and
me
to
be
taught
some
trade
so
my
sister
was
apprenticed
to
a
dressmaker
and
i
to
a
milliner
fetchke
of
course
was
successful
and
i
of
course
was
not
my
sister
managed
to
learn
her
trade
although
most
of
the
time
at
the
dressmaker
she
had
to
spend
in
sweeping
running
errands
and
minding
the
babies
the
usual
occupations
of
the
apprentice
in
any
trade
but
i
i
had
to
be
taken
away
from
the
milliner
after
a
couple
of
months
i
did
try
honestly
with
all
my
eyes
i
watched
my
mistress
build
up
a
chimney
pot
of
straw
and
things
i
ripped
up
old
bonnets
with
enthusiasm
i
picked
up
everybody
spools
and
thimbles
and
other
objects
i
did
just
as
i
was
told
for
i
was
determined
to
become
a
famous
milliner
since
america
honored
the
workman
so
but
most
of
the
time
i
was
sent
away
on
errands
to
the
market
to
buy
soup
greens
to
the
corner
store
to
get
change
and
all
over
town
with
bandboxes
half
as
round
again
as
i
it
was
winter
and
i
was
not
very
well
dressed
i
froze
i
coughed
my
mistress
said
i
was
not
of
much
use
to
her
so
my
mother
kept
me
at
home
and
my
career
as
a
milliner
was
blighted
this
was
during
our
last
year
in
russia
when
i
was
between
twelve
and
thirteen
years
of
age
i
was
old
enough
to
be
ashamed
of
my
failures
but
i
did
not
have
much
time
to
think
about
them
because
my
uncle
solomon
took
me
with
him
to
vitebsk
it
was
not
my
first
visit
to
that
city
a
few
years
before
i
had
spent
some
days
there
in
the
care
of
my
father
cousin
rachel
who
journeyed
periodically
to
the
capital
of
the
province
to
replenish
her
stock
of
spools
and
combs
and
like
small
wares
by
the
sale
of
which
she
was
slowly
earning
her
dowry
on
that
first
occasion
cousin
rachel
who
had
developed
in
business
that
dual
conscience
one
for
her
jewish
neighbors
and
one
for
the
gentiles
decided
to
carry
me
without
a
ticket
i
was
so
small
though
of
an
age
to
pay
that
it
was
not
difficult
i
remember
her
simple
stratagem
from
beginning
to
end
when
we
approached
the
ticket
office
she
whispered
to
me
to
stoop
a
little
and
i
stooped
the
ticket
agent
passed
me
in
the
car
she
bade
me
curl
up
in
the
seat
and
i
curled
up
she
threw
a
shawl
over
me
and
bade
me
pretend
to
sleep
and
i
pretended
to
sleep
i
heard
the
conductor
collect
the
tickets
i
knew
when
he
was
looking
at
me
i
heard
him
ask
my
age
and
i
heard
cousin
rachel
lie
about
it
i
was
allowed
to
sit
up
when
the
conductor
was
gone
and
i
sat
up
and
looked
out
of
the
window
and
saw
everything
and
was
perfectly
perfectly
happy
i
was
fond
of
my
cousin
and
i
smiled
at
her
in
perfect
understanding
and
admiration
of
her
cleverness
in
beating
the
railroad
company
i
knew
then
as
i
know
now
beyond
a
doubt
that
my
uncle
daughter
was
an
honorable
woman
with
the
righteous
she
dealt
squarely
with
the
unjust
as
best
she
could
she
was
in
duty
bound
to
make
all
the
money
she
could
for
money
was
her
only
protection
in
the
midst
of
the
enemy
every
kopeck
she
earned
or
saved
was
a
scale
in
her
coat
of
armor
we
learned
this
code
early
in
life
in
polotzk
so
i
was
pleased
with
the
success
of
our
ruse
on
this
occasion
though
i
should
have
been
horrified
if
i
had
seen
cousin
rachel
cheat
a
jew
we
made
our
headquarters
in
that
part
of
vitebsk
where
my
numerous
cousins
and
aunts
lived
in
more
or
less
poverty
or
at
most
in
the
humblest
comfort
but
i
was
taken
to
my
uncle
solomon
to
spend
the
sabbath
i
remember
a
long
walk
through
magnificent
avenues
and
past
splendid
shops
and
houses
and
gardens
vitebsk
was
a
metropolis
beside
provincial
polotzk
and
i
was
very
small
even
without
stooping
uncle
solomon
lived
in
the
better
part
of
the
city
and
i
found
his
place
very
attractive
still
after
a
night
sleep
i
was
ready
for
further
travel
and
adventures
and
i
set
out
without
a
word
to
anybody
to
retrace
my
steps
clear
across
the
city
the
way
was
twice
as
long
as
on
the
preceding
day
perhaps
because
such
small
feet
set
the
pace
perhaps
because
i
lingered
as
long
as
i
pleased
at
the
shop
windows
at
some
corners
too
i
had
to
stop
and
study
my
route
i
do
not
think
i
was
frightened
at
all
though
i
imagine
my
back
was
very
straight
and
my
head
very
high
all
the
way
for
i
was
well
aware
that
i
was
out
on
an
adventure
i
did
not
speak
to
any
one
till
i
reached
my
aunt
leah
and
then
i
hardly
had
a
chance
to
speak
i
was
so
much
hugged
and
laughed
over
and
cried
over
and
questioned
and
without
anybody
waiting
to
hear
my
answers
i
had
meant
to
surprise
cousin
rachel
and
i
had
frightened
her
when
she
had
come
to
uncle
solomon
to
take
me
back
she
found
the
house
in
an
uproar
everybody
frightened
at
my
disappearance
the
neighborhood
was
searched
and
at
last
messengers
were
sent
to
aunt
leah
the
messengers
in
their
haste
quite
overlooked
me
it
was
their
fault
if
they
took
a
short
cut
unknown
to
me
i
was
all
the
time
faithfully
steering
by
the
sign
of
the
tobacco
shop
and
the
shop
with
the
in
the
window
and
the
garden
with
the
iron
fence
and
the
sentry
box
opposite
a
drug
store
and
all
the
rest
of
my
landmarks
as
carefully
entered
on
my
mental
chart
the
day
before
all
this
i
told
my
scared
relatives
as
soon
as
they
let
me
till
they
were
convinced
that
i
was
not
lost
nor
stolen
by
the
gypsies
nor
otherwise
done
away
with
cousin
rachel
was
so
glad
that
she
would
not
have
to
return
to
polotzk
that
she
would
not
let
anybody
scold
me
she
made
me
tell
over
and
over
what
i
had
seen
on
the
way
till
they
all
laughed
and
praised
my
acuteness
for
seeing
so
much
more
than
they
had
supposed
there
was
to
see
indeed
i
was
made
a
heroine
which
was
just
what
i
intended
to
be
when
i
set
out
on
my
adventure
and
thus
ended
most
of
my
unlawful
escapades
i
was
more
petted
than
scolded
for
my
insubordination
my
second
journey
to
vitebsk
in
the
company
of
uncle
solomon
i
remember
as
well
as
the
first
i
had
been
up
all
night
dancing
at
a
wedding
and
had
gone
home
only
to
pick
up
my
small
bundle
and
be
picked
up
in
turn
by
my
uncle
i
was
a
little
taller
now
and
had
my
own
ticket
like
a
real
traveller
it
was
still
early
in
the
morning
when
the
train
pulled
out
of
the
station
or
else
it
was
a
misty
day
i
know
the
fields
looked
soft
and
gray
when
we
got
out
into
the
country
and
the
trees
were
blurred
i
did
not
want
to
sleep
a
new
day
had
begun
a
new
adventure
i
would
not
miss
any
of
it
but
the
last
day
so
unnaturally
prolonged
was
entangled
in
the
skirts
of
the
new
when
did
yesterday
end
why
was
not
this
new
day
the
same
day
continued
i
looked
up
at
my
uncle
but
he
was
smiling
at
me
in
that
amused
way
of
his
he
always
seemed
to
be
amused
at
me
and
he
would
make
me
talk
and
then
laugh
at
me
so
i
did
not
ask
my
question
indeed
i
could
not
formulate
it
so
i
kept
staring
out
on
the
dim
country
and
thinking
and
thinking
and
all
the
while
the
engine
throbbed
and
lurched
and
the
wheels
ground
along
and
i
was
astonished
to
hear
that
they
were
keeping
perfectly
the
time
of
the
last
waltz
i
had
danced
at
the
wedding
i
sang
it
through
in
my
head
yes
that
was
the
rhythm
the
engine
knew
it
the
whole
machine
repeated
it
and
sent
vibrations
through
my
body
that
were
just
like
the
movements
of
the
waltz
i
was
so
much
interested
in
this
discovery
that
i
forgot
the
problem
of
the
continuity
of
time
and
from
that
day
to
this
whenever
i
have
heard
that
waltz
one
of
the
sweet
danube
waltzes
i
have
lived
through
that
entire
experience
the
festive
night
the
misty
morning
the
abnormal
consciousness
of
time
as
if
i
had
existed
forever
without
a
break
the
journey
the
dim
landscape
and
the
tune
singing
itself
in
my
head
never
can
i
hear
that
waltz
without
the
accompaniment
of
engine
wheels
grinding
rhythmically
along
speeding
tracks
i
remained
in
vitebsk
about
six
months
i
do
not
believe
i
was
ever
homesick
during
all
that
time
i
was
too
happy
to
be
homesick
the
life
suited
me
extremely
well
my
life
in
polotzk
had
grown
meaner
and
duller
as
the
family
fortunes
declined
for
years
there
had
been
no
lessons
no
pleasant
excursions
no
jolly
gatherings
with
uncles
and
aunts
poverty
shadowed
by
pride
trampled
down
our
simple
ambitions
and
simpler
joys
i
can
not
honestly
say
that
i
was
very
sensitive
to
our
losses
i
do
not
remember
suffering
because
there
was
no
jam
on
my
bread
and
no
new
dress
for
the
holidays
i
do
not
know
whether
i
was
hurt
when
some
of
our
playmates
abandoned
us
i
remember
myself
oftener
in
the
attitude
of
an
onlooker
as
on
the
occasion
of
the
attachment
of
our
furniture
when
i
went
off
into
a
corner
to
think
about
it
perhaps
i
was
not
able
to
cling
to
negations
the
possession
of
the
bread
was
a
more
absorbing
fact
than
the
loss
of
the
jam
if
i
were
to
read
my
character
backwards
i
ought
to
believe
that
i
did
miss
what
i
lacked
in
our
days
of
privation
for
i
know
to
my
shame
that
in
more
recent
years
i
have
cried
for
jam
but
i
am
trying
not
to
reason
only
to
remember
and
from
many
scattered
and
shadowy
memories
that
glimmer
and
fade
away
so
fast
that
i
can
not
fix
them
on
this
page
i
form
an
idea
almost
a
conviction
that
it
was
with
me
as
i
say
however
indifferent
i
may
have
been
to
what
i
had
not
i
was
fully
alive
to
what
i
had
so
when
i
came
to
vitebsk
i
eagerly
seized
on
the
many
new
things
that
i
found
around
me
and
these
new
impressions
and
experiences
affected
me
so
much
that
i
count
that
visit
as
an
epoch
in
my
russian
life
i
was
very
much
at
home
in
my
uncle
household
i
was
a
little
afraid
of
my
aunt
who
had
a
quick
temper
but
on
the
whole
i
liked
her
she
was
fair
and
thin
and
had
a
pretty
smile
in
the
wake
of
her
tempers
uncle
solomon
was
an
old
friend
i
was
fond
of
him
and
he
made
much
of
me
his
fine
brown
eyes
were
full
of
smiles
and
there
always
was
a
pleasant
smile
for
me
or
a
teasing
one
uncle
solomon
was
comparatively
prosperous
so
i
soon
forgot
whatever
i
had
known
at
home
of
sordid
cares
i
do
not
remember
that
i
was
ever
haunted
by
the
thought
of
my
mother
who
slaved
to
keep
us
in
bread
or
of
my
sister
so
little
older
than
myself
who
bent
her
little
back
to
a
woman
work
i
took
up
the
life
around
me
as
if
there
were
no
other
life
i
did
not
play
all
the
time
but
i
enjoyed
whatever
work
i
found
because
i
was
so
happy
i
helped
my
cousin
dinke
help
her
mother
with
the
housework
i
put
it
this
way
because
i
think
my
aunt
never
set
me
any
tasks
but
dinke
was
glad
to
have
me
help
wash
dishes
and
sweep
and
make
beds
my
cousin
was
a
gentle
sweet
girl
and
fair
and
altogether
attractive
she
talked
to
me
about
things
and
i
liked
it
when
her
friends
came
to
visit
her
she
did
not
mind
having
me
about
although
my
skirts
were
so
short
my
helping
hand
was
extended
also
to
my
smaller
cousins
mendele
and
perele
i
played
lotto
with
mendele
and
let
him
beat
me
i
found
him
when
he
was
lost
and
i
helped
him
play
tricks
on
our
elders
perele
the
baby
was
at
times
my
special
charge
and
i
think
she
did
not
suffer
in
my
hands
i
was
a
good
nurse
though
my
methods
were
somewhat
original
uncle
solomon
was
often
away
on
business
and
in
his
absence
cousin
hirshel
was
my
hero
hirshel
was
only
a
little
older
than
i
but
he
was
a
pupil
in
the
high
school
and
wore
the
student
uniform
and
knew
nearly
as
much
as
my
uncle
i
thought
when
he
buckled
on
his
satchel
of
books
in
the
morning
and
strode
away
straight
as
a
soldier
no
heder
boy
ever
walked
like
that
i
stood
in
the
doorway
and
worshipped
his
retreating
steps
i
met
him
on
his
return
in
the
late
afternoon
and
hung
over
him
when
he
laid
out
his
books
for
his
lessons
sometimes
he
had
long
russian
pieces
to
commit
to
memory
he
would
walk
up
and
down
repeating
the
lines
out
loud
and
i
learned
as
fast
as
he
he
would
let
me
hold
the
book
while
he
recited
and
a
proud
girl
was
i
if
i
could
correct
him
my
interest
in
his
lessons
amused
him
he
did
not
take
me
seriously
he
looked
much
like
his
father
and
twinkled
his
eyes
at
me
in
the
same
way
and
made
fun
of
me
too
but
sometimes
he
condescended
to
set
me
a
lesson
in
spelling
or
arithmetic
in
reading
i
was
as
good
as
he
and
if
i
did
well
he
praised
me
and
went
and
told
the
family
about
it
but
lest
i
grow
too
proud
of
my
achievements
he
would
sit
down
and
do
mysterious
sums
i
now
believe
it
was
algebra
to
which
i
had
no
clue
whatever
and
which
duly
impressed
me
with
a
sense
of
my
ignorance
there
were
other
books
in
the
house
than
the
hebrew
books
of
course
were
there
as
in
other
jewish
homes
but
i
was
no
longer
devoted
to
the
psalms
there
were
a
few
books
about
in
russian
and
in
yiddish
that
were
neither
works
of
devotion
nor
of
instruction
these
were
and
poems
they
were
a
great
surprise
to
me
and
a
greater
delight
i
read
them
hungrily
all
there
were
a
mere
handful
but
to
me
an
overwhelming
treasure
of
all
those
books
i
remember
by
name
only
robinson
crusoe
i
think
i
preferred
the
stories
to
the
poems
though
poetry
was
good
to
recite
walking
up
and
down
like
cousin
hirshel
that
was
my
introduction
to
secular
literature
but
i
did
not
understand
it
at
the
time
when
i
had
exhausted
the
books
i
began
on
the
old
volumes
of
a
russian
periodical
which
i
found
on
a
shelf
in
my
room
there
was
a
high
stack
of
these
paper
volumes
and
i
was
so
hungry
for
books
that
i
went
at
them
greedily
fearing
that
i
might
not
get
through
before
i
had
to
return
to
polotzk
i
read
every
spare
minute
of
the
day
and
most
of
the
night
i
scarcely
ever
stopped
at
night
until
my
lamp
burned
out
then
i
would
creep
into
bed
beside
dinke
but
often
my
head
burned
so
from
excitement
that
i
did
not
sleep
at
once
and
no
wonder
the
violent
romances
which
rushed
through
the
pages
of
that
periodical
were
fit
to
inflame
an
older
more
sophisticated
brain
than
mine
i
must
believe
that
it
was
a
thoroughly
respectable
magazine
because
i
found
it
in
my
uncle
solomon
house
but
the
novels
it
printed
were
certainly
sensational
if
i
dare
judge
from
my
lurid
recollections
these
romances
indeed
may
have
had
their
literary
qualities
which
i
was
too
untrained
to
appreciate
i
remember
nothing
but
startling
adventures
of
strange
heroes
and
heroines
violent
catastrophes
in
every
chapter
beautiful
maidens
abducted
by
cruel
cossacks
inhuman
mothers
who
poisoned
their
daughters
for
jealousy
of
their
lovers
and
all
these
things
happening
in
a
strange
world
the
very
language
of
which
was
unnatural
to
me
i
was
quick
enough
to
fix
meanings
to
new
words
however
so
keen
was
my
interest
in
what
i
read
indeed
when
i
recall
the
zest
with
which
i
devoured
those
fearful
pages
the
thrill
with
which
i
followed
the
heartless
mother
or
the
abused
maiden
in
her
adventures
my
heart
beating
in
my
throat
when
my
little
lamp
began
to
flicker
and
then
myself
and
shivery
in
the
dark
stealing
to
bed
like
a
guilty
ghost
when
i
remember
all
this
i
have
an
unpleasant
feeling
as
of
one
hearing
of
another
debauch
and
i
would
be
glad
to
shake
the
little
bony
culprit
that
i
was
then
my
uncle
was
away
so
much
of
the
time
that
i
doubt
if
he
knew
how
i
spent
my
nights
my
aunt
poor
housewife
knew
too
little
of
books
to
direct
my
reading
my
cousins
were
not
enough
older
than
myself
to
play
mentors
to
me
besides
all
this
i
think
it
was
tacitly
agreed
at
my
uncle
as
at
home
that
mashke
was
best
let
alone
in
such
matters
so
i
burnt
my
midnight
lamp
and
filled
my
mind
with
a
conglomeration
of
images
entirely
unsuited
to
my
mental
digestion
and
no
one
can
say
what
they
would
have
bred
in
me
besides
headache
and
nervousness
had
they
not
been
so
soon
dispelled
and
superseded
by
a
host
of
strong
new
impressions
for
these
readings
ended
with
my
visit
which
was
closely
followed
by
the
preparations
for
our
emigration
on
the
whole
then
i
do
not
feel
that
i
was
seriously
harmed
by
my
wild
reading
i
have
not
been
told
that
my
taste
was
corrupted
and
my
morals
i
believe
have
also
escaped
serious
stricture
i
would
even
say
that
i
have
never
been
hurt
by
any
revelation
however
distorted
or
untimely
that
i
found
in
books
good
or
poor
that
i
have
never
read
an
idle
book
that
was
entirely
useless
and
that
i
have
never
quite
lost
whatever
was
significant
to
my
spirit
in
any
book
good
or
bad
even
though
my
conscious
memory
can
give
no
account
of
it
one
lived
at
uncle
solomon
not
only
one
own
life
but
the
life
of
all
around
my
uncle
when
he
returned
after
a
short
absence
had
stories
to
tell
and
adventures
to
describe
and
i
learned
that
one
might
travel
considerably
and
see
things
unknown
even
in
vitebsk
without
going
as
far
as
america
my
cousins
sometimes
went
to
the
theatre
and
i
listened
with
rapture
to
their
account
of
what
they
had
seen
and
i
learned
the
songs
they
had
heard
once
cousin
hirshel
went
to
see
a
giant
who
exhibited
himself
for
three
kopecks
and
came
home
with
such
marvellous
accounts
of
his
astonishing
proportions
and
his
amazing
feats
of
strength
that
little
mendele
cried
for
envy
and
i
had
to
play
lotto
with
him
and
let
him
beat
me
oh
so
easily
till
he
felt
himself
a
man
again
and
sometimes
i
had
adventures
of
my
own
i
explored
the
city
to
some
extent
by
myself
or
else
my
cousins
took
me
with
them
on
their
errands
there
were
so
many
fine
people
to
see
such
wonderful
shops
such
great
distances
to
go
once
they
took
me
to
a
bookstore
i
saw
shelves
and
shelves
of
books
and
people
buying
them
and
taking
them
away
to
keep
i
was
told
that
some
people
had
in
their
own
houses
more
books
than
were
in
the
store
was
not
that
wonderful
it
was
a
great
city
vitebsk
i
never
could
exhaust
its
delights
although
i
did
not
often
think
of
my
people
at
home
struggling
desperately
to
live
while
i
revelled
in
abundance
and
pleasure
and
excitement
i
did
do
my
little
to
help
the
family
by
giving
lessons
in
lacemaking
as
this
was
the
only
time
in
my
life
that
i
earned
money
by
the
work
of
my
hands
i
take
care
not
to
forget
it
and
i
like
to
give
an
account
of
it
i
was
always
as
i
have
elsewhere
admitted
very
clumsy
with
my
hands
counting
five
thumbs
to
the
hand
knitting
and
embroidery
at
which
my
sister
was
so
clever
i
could
never
do
with
any
degree
of
skill
the
blue
peacock
with
the
red
tail
that
i
achieved
in
was
not
a
performance
of
any
grace
neither
was
i
very
much
downcast
at
my
failures
in
this
field
i
was
not
an
ambitious
needlewoman
but
when
the
fad
for
russian
lace
was
introduced
into
polotzk
by
a
family
of
sisters
who
had
been
expelled
from
petersburg
and
all
feminine
polotzk
on
both
sides
of
the
dvina
dropped
knitting
and
crochet
needles
and
embroidery
frames
to
take
up
pillow
and
bobbins
i
too
was
carried
away
by
the
novelty
and
applied
myself
heartily
to
learn
the
intricate
art
with
the
result
that
i
did
master
it
the
russian
sisters
charged
enormous
fees
for
lessons
and
made
a
fortune
out
of
the
sale
of
patterns
while
they
held
the
monopoly
their
pupils
passed
on
the
art
at
reduced
fees
and
their
pupils
pupils
charged
still
less
until
even
the
humblest
cottage
rang
with
the
pretty
click
of
the
bobbins
and
my
cousin
rachel
sold
steel
pins
by
the
ounce
instead
of
by
the
dozen
and
the
women
exchanged
cardboard
patterns
from
one
end
of
town
to
the
other
my
teacher
who
taught
me
without
fee
being
a
friend
of
our
prosperous
days
lived
on
the
other
side
it
was
winter
and
many
a
time
i
crossed
the
frozen
river
carrying
a
lace
pillow
as
big
as
myself
till
my
hands
were
numb
with
cold
but
i
persisted
afraid
as
i
was
of
cold
and
when
i
came
to
vitebsk
i
was
glad
of
my
one
accomplishment
for
vitebsk
had
not
yet
seen
russian
lace
and
i
was
an
acceptable
teacher
of
the
new
art
though
i
was
such
a
mite
because
there
was
no
other
i
taught
my
cousin
dinke
of
course
and
i
had
a
number
of
paying
pupils
i
gave
lessons
at
my
pupils
homes
and
was
very
proud
going
thus
about
town
and
being
received
as
a
person
of
importance
if
my
feet
did
not
reach
the
floor
when
i
sat
in
a
chair
my
hands
knew
their
business
for
once
and
i
was
such
a
conscientious
and
enthusiastic
teacher
that
i
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
all
my
pupils
execute
difficult
pieces
before
i
left
vitebsk
i
never
have
seen
money
that
was
half
so
bright
to
look
at
half
so
pretty
to
clink
as
the
money
i
earned
by
these
lessons
and
it
was
easy
to
decide
what
to
do
with
my
wealth
i
bought
presents
for
everybody
i
knew
i
remember
to
this
day
the
pattern
of
the
shawl
i
bought
for
my
mother
when
i
came
home
and
unpacked
my
treasures
i
was
the
proudest
girl
in
polotzk
the
proudest
but
not
the
happiest
i
found
my
family
in
such
a
pitiful
state
that
all
my
joy
was
stifled
by
care
if
only
for
a
while
unwilling
to
spoil
my
holiday
my
mother
had
not
written
me
how
things
had
gone
from
bad
to
worse
during
my
absence
and
i
was
not
prepared
fetchke
met
me
at
the
station
and
conducted
me
to
a
more
wretched
hole
than
i
had
ever
called
home
before
i
went
into
the
room
alone
having
been
greeted
outside
by
my
mother
and
brother
it
was
evening
and
the
shabbiness
of
the
apartment
was
all
the
gloomier
for
the
light
of
a
small
kerosene
lamp
standing
on
the
bare
deal
table
at
one
end
of
the
table
is
this
deborah
my
little
sister
dressed
in
an
ugly
gray
jacket
sat
motionless
in
the
lamplight
her
fair
head
drooping
her
little
hands
folded
on
the
edge
of
the
table
at
sight
of
her
i
grew
suddenly
old
it
was
merely
that
she
was
a
shy
little
girl
unbecomingly
dressed
and
perhaps
a
little
pale
from
underfeeding
but
to
me
at
that
moment
she
was
the
personification
of
dejection
the
living
symbol
of
the
fallen
family
state
of
course
my
sober
mood
did
not
last
long
even
fallen
family
state
could
be
interpreted
in
terms
of
money
absent
money
and
that
as
once
established
was
a
trifling
matter
had
i
earned
money
myself
heaps
of
it
only
look
at
this
and
this
and
this
that
i
brought
from
vitebsk
bought
with
my
own
money
no
i
did
not
remain
old
for
many
years
more
i
was
a
very
childish
child
perhaps
i
had
spent
my
time
in
vitebsk
to
better
advantage
than
at
the
milliner
from
any
point
of
view
when
i
returned
to
my
native
town
i
things
i
saw
the
narrowness
the
stifling
narrowness
of
life
in
polotzk
my
books
my
walks
my
visits
as
teacher
to
many
homes
had
been
so
many
doors
opening
on
a
wider
world
so
many
horizons
one
beyond
the
other
the
boundaries
of
life
had
stretched
and
i
had
filled
my
lungs
with
the
thrilling
air
from
a
great
beyond
child
though
i
was
polotzk
when
i
came
back
was
too
small
for
me
and
even
vitebsk
for
all
its
peepholes
into
a
beyond
presently
began
to
shrink
in
my
imagination
as
america
loomed
near
my
letters
warned
us
to
prepare
for
the
summons
and
we
lived
in
a
quiver
of
expectation
not
that
my
father
had
grown
suddenly
rich
he
was
so
far
from
rich
that
he
was
going
to
borrow
every
cent
of
the
money
for
our
passage
but
he
had
a
business
in
view
which
he
could
carry
on
all
the
better
for
having
the
family
with
him
and
besides
we
were
borrowing
right
and
left
anyway
and
to
no
definite
purpose
with
the
children
he
argued
every
year
in
russia
was
a
year
lost
they
should
be
spending
the
precious
years
in
school
in
learning
english
in
becoming
americans
united
in
america
there
were
ten
chances
of
our
getting
to
our
feet
again
to
one
chance
in
our
scattered
aimless
state
so
at
last
i
was
going
to
america
really
really
going
at
last
the
boundaries
burst
the
arch
of
heaven
soared
a
million
suns
shone
out
for
every
star
the
winds
rushed
in
from
outer
space
roaring
in
my
ears
america
america
chapter
viii
the
exodus
on
the
day
when
our
steamer
ticket
arrived
my
mother
did
not
go
out
with
her
basket
my
brother
stayed
out
of
heder
and
my
sister
salted
the
soup
three
times
i
do
not
know
what
i
did
to
celebrate
the
occasion
very
likely
i
played
tricks
on
deborah
and
wrote
a
long
letter
to
my
father
before
sunset
the
news
was
all
over
polotzk
that
hannah
hayye
had
received
a
steamer
ticket
for
america
then
they
began
to
come
friends
and
foes
distant
relatives
and
new
acquaintances
young
and
old
wise
and
foolish
debtors
and
creditors
and
mere
neighbors
from
every
quarter
of
the
city
from
both
sides
of
the
dvina
from
over
the
polota
from
nowhere
a
steady
stream
of
them
poured
into
our
street
both
day
and
night
till
the
hour
of
our
departure
and
my
mother
gave
audience
her
faded
kerchief
halfway
off
her
head
her
black
ringlets
straying
her
apron
often
at
her
eyes
she
received
her
guests
in
a
rainbow
of
smiles
and
tears
she
was
the
heroine
of
polotzk
and
she
conducted
herself
appropriately
she
gave
her
heart
thanks
for
the
congratulations
and
blessings
that
poured
in
on
her
ready
tears
for
condolences
patient
answers
to
monotonous
questions
and
handshakes
and
kisses
and
hugs
she
gave
gratis
what
did
they
not
ask
the
eager
foolish
friendly
people
they
wanted
to
handle
the
ticket
and
mother
must
read
them
what
is
written
on
it
how
much
did
it
cost
was
it
all
paid
for
were
we
going
to
have
a
foreign
passport
or
did
we
intend
to
steal
across
the
border
were
we
not
all
going
to
have
new
dresses
to
travel
in
was
it
sure
that
we
could
get
koscher
food
on
the
ship
and
with
the
questions
poured
in
suggestions
and
solid
chunks
of
advice
were
rammed
in
by
nimble
prophecies
mother
ought
to
make
a
pilgrimage
to
a
good
jew
say
the
rebbe
of
lubavitch
to
get
his
blessing
on
our
journey
she
must
be
sure
and
pack
her
prayer
books
and
bible
and
twenty
pounds
of
zwieback
at
the
least
if
they
did
serve
trefah
on
the
ship
she
and
the
four
children
would
have
to
starve
unless
she
carried
provisions
from
oh
she
must
take
all
the
featherbeds
featherbeds
are
scarce
in
america
in
america
they
sleep
on
hard
mattresses
even
in
winter
haveh
mirel
yachne
the
daughter
who
emigrated
to
new
york
two
years
ago
wrote
her
mother
that
she
got
up
from
childbed
with
sore
sides
because
she
had
no
mother
must
carry
her
money
in
a
pocketbook
she
must
sew
it
into
the
lining
of
her
jacket
the
policemen
in
castle
garden
take
all
their
money
from
the
passengers
as
they
land
unless
the
travellers
deny
having
any
and
so
on
and
so
on
till
my
poor
mother
was
completely
bewildered
and
as
the
day
set
for
our
departure
approached
the
people
came
oftener
and
stayed
longer
and
rehearsed
my
mother
in
long
messages
for
their
friends
in
america
praying
that
she
deliver
them
promptly
on
her
arrival
and
without
fail
and
might
god
bless
her
for
her
kindness
and
she
must
be
sure
and
write
them
how
she
found
their
friends
hayye
dvoshe
the
for
the
eleventh
time
repeating
herself
to
my
mother
still
patiently
attentive
thus
promise
me
i
beg
you
i
do
sleep
nights
for
thinking
of
him
emigrated
to
america
eighteen
months
ago
fresh
and
well
and
strong
with
ruble
in
his
pocket
besides
his
steamer
ticket
with
new
phylacteries
and
a
silk
and
a
suit
as
good
as
new
made
it
only
three
years
before
everything
respectable
there
could
be
nothing
better
sent
one
letter
how
he
arrived
in
castle
garden
how
well
he
was
received
by
his
uncle
how
he
was
conducted
to
the
baths
how
they
bought
him
an
american
suit
everything
good
fine
pleasant
wrote
how
his
relative
promised
him
a
position
in
his
business
a
clothing
merchant
is
he
makes
gold
and
since
then
not
a
postal
card
not
a
word
just
as
if
he
had
vanished
as
if
the
earth
had
swallowed
him
weh
what
have
i
imagined
what
have
i
dreamed
what
have
i
lamented
already
three
letters
have
i
sent
the
last
one
you
know
you
yourself
wrote
for
me
hannah
hayye
dear
and
no
answer
lost
as
if
in
the
sea
and
after
the
application
of
a
corner
of
her
shawl
to
eyes
and
nose
hayye
dvoshe
continuing
so
you
will
go
into
the
newspaper
and
ask
them
what
has
become
of
my
möshele
and
if
he
is
in
castle
garden
maybe
he
went
up
to
it
in
the
neighborhood
you
know
and
you
can
tell
them
for
a
mark
that
he
has
a
silk
handkerchief
with
his
monogram
in
russian
that
his
betrothed
embroidered
for
him
before
the
engagement
was
broken
and
may
god
grant
you
an
easy
journey
and
may
you
arrive
in
a
propitious
hour
and
may
you
find
your
husband
well
and
strong
and
rich
and
may
you
both
live
to
lead
your
children
to
the
wedding
canopy
and
may
america
shower
gold
on
you
amen
the
weeks
skipped
the
days
took
wing
an
hour
was
a
flash
of
thought
so
brimful
of
events
was
the
interval
before
our
departure
and
no
one
was
more
alive
than
i
to
the
multiple
significance
of
the
daily
drama
my
mother
full
of
grief
at
the
parting
from
home
and
family
and
all
things
dear
anxious
about
the
journey
uncertain
about
the
future
but
ready
as
ever
to
take
up
what
new
burdens
awaited
her
my
sister
one
with
our
mother
in
every
hope
and
apprehension
my
brother
rejoicing
in
his
sudden
release
from
heder
and
the
little
sister
vaguely
excited
by
mysteries
afoot
the
uncles
and
aunts
and
devoted
neighbors
sad
and
solemn
over
their
coming
loss
and
my
father
away
over
in
boston
eager
and
anxious
about
us
in
polotzk
an
american
citizen
impatient
to
start
his
children
on
american
careers
i
knew
the
minds
of
every
one
of
these
and
i
lived
their
days
and
nights
with
them
after
an
apish
fashion
of
my
own
but
at
bottom
i
was
aloof
from
them
all
what
made
me
silent
and
was
the
sense
of
being
in
the
midst
of
a
tremendous
adventure
from
morning
till
night
i
was
all
attention
i
must
credit
myself
with
some
pang
of
parting
i
certainly
felt
the
thrill
of
expectation
but
keener
than
these
was
my
delight
in
the
progress
of
the
great
adventure
it
was
delightful
just
to
be
myself
i
rejoiced
with
the
younger
children
during
the
weeks
of
packing
and
preparation
in
the
relaxation
of
discipline
and
the
general
demoralization
of
our
daily
life
it
was
pleasant
to
be
petted
and
spoiled
by
favorite
cousins
and
stuffed
with
belated
sweets
by
unfavorite
ones
it
was
distinctly
interesting
to
catch
my
mother
weeping
in
corner
cupboards
over
precious
rubbish
that
could
by
no
means
be
carried
to
america
it
was
agreeable
to
have
my
uncle
moses
stroke
my
hair
and
regard
me
with
affectionate
eyes
while
he
told
me
that
i
would
soon
forget
him
and
asked
me
so
coaxingly
to
write
him
an
account
of
our
journey
it
was
delicious
to
be
notorious
through
the
length
and
breadth
of
polotzk
to
be
stopped
and
questioned
at
every
when
i
ran
out
to
buy
two
kopecks
worth
of
butter
to
be
treated
with
respect
by
my
former
playmates
if
ever
i
found
time
to
mingle
with
them
to
be
pointed
at
by
my
enemies
as
i
passed
them
importantly
on
the
street
and
all
my
delight
and
pride
and
interest
were
steeped
in
a
the
sense
that
it
was
i
mashke
that
was
moving
and
acting
in
the
midst
of
unusual
events
now
that
i
was
sure
of
america
i
was
in
no
hurry
to
depart
and
not
impatient
to
arrive
i
was
willing
to
linger
over
every
detail
of
our
progress
and
so
cherish
the
flavor
of
the
adventure
the
last
night
in
polotzk
we
slept
at
my
uncle
house
having
disposed
of
all
our
belongings
to
the
last
stool
except
such
as
we
were
taking
with
us
i
could
go
straight
to
the
room
where
i
slept
with
my
aunt
that
night
if
i
were
suddenly
set
down
in
polotzk
but
i
did
not
really
sleep
excitement
kept
me
awake
and
my
aunt
snored
hideously
in
the
morning
i
was
going
away
from
polotzk
forever
and
ever
i
was
going
on
a
wonderful
journey
i
was
going
to
america
how
could
i
sleep
my
uncle
gave
out
a
false
bulletin
with
the
last
batch
that
the
gossips
carried
away
in
the
evening
he
told
them
that
we
were
not
going
to
start
till
the
second
day
this
he
did
in
the
hope
of
smuggling
us
quietly
out
and
so
saving
us
the
wear
and
tear
of
a
public
farewell
but
his
ruse
failed
of
success
half
of
polotzk
was
at
my
uncle
gate
in
the
morning
to
conduct
us
to
the
railway
station
and
the
other
half
was
already
there
before
we
arrived
the
procession
resembled
both
a
funeral
and
a
triumph
the
women
wept
over
us
reminding
us
eloquently
of
the
perils
of
the
sea
of
the
bewilderment
of
a
foreign
land
of
the
torments
of
homesickness
that
awaited
us
they
bewailed
my
mother
lot
who
had
to
tear
herself
away
from
blood
relations
to
go
among
strangers
who
had
to
face
gendarmes
ticket
agents
and
sailors
unprotected
by
a
masculine
escort
who
had
to
care
for
four
young
children
in
the
confusion
of
travel
and
very
likely
feed
them
trefah
or
see
them
starve
on
the
way
or
they
praised
her
for
a
brave
pilgrim
and
expressed
confidence
in
her
ability
to
cope
with
gendarmes
and
ticket
agents
and
blessed
her
with
every
other
word
and
all
but
carried
her
in
their
arms
at
the
station
the
procession
disbanded
and
became
a
mob
my
uncle
and
my
tall
cousins
did
their
best
to
protect
us
but
we
wanderers
were
almost
torn
to
pieces
they
did
get
us
into
a
car
at
last
but
the
riot
on
the
station
platform
continued
unquelled
when
the
warning
bell
rang
out
it
was
drowned
in
a
confounding
babel
of
voices
fragments
of
the
messages
admonitions
lamentations
blessings
farewells
do
forget
take
care
of
keep
your
tickets
möshele
newspapers
garlick
is
best
happy
journey
god
help
you
remember
the
last
i
saw
of
polotzk
was
an
agitated
mass
of
people
waving
colored
handkerchiefs
and
other
frantic
bits
of
calico
madly
gesticulating
falling
on
each
other
necks
gone
wild
altogether
then
the
station
became
invisible
and
the
shining
tracks
spun
out
from
sky
to
sky
i
was
in
the
middle
of
the
great
great
world
and
the
longest
road
was
mine
memory
may
take
a
rest
while
i
copy
from
a
contemporaneous
document
the
story
of
the
great
voyage
in
accordance
with
my
promise
to
my
uncle
i
wrote
during
my
first
months
in
america
a
detailed
account
of
our
adventures
between
polotzk
and
boston
ink
was
cheap
and
the
epistle
in
yiddish
occupied
me
for
many
hot
summer
hours
it
was
a
great
disaster
therefore
to
have
a
lamp
upset
on
my
when
i
was
near
the
end
soaking
the
thick
pile
of
letter
sheets
in
kerosene
i
was
obliged
to
make
a
fair
copy
for
my
uncle
and
my
father
kept
the
oily
smelly
original
after
a
couple
of
teasing
he
induced
me
to
translate
the
letter
into
english
for
the
benefit
of
a
friend
who
did
not
know
yiddish
for
the
benefit
of
the
present
narrative
which
was
not
thought
of
thirteen
years
ago
i
can
hardly
refrain
from
moralizing
as
i
turn
to
the
leaves
of
my
childish
manuscript
grateful
at
last
for
the
calamity
of
the
overturned
lamp
our
route
lay
over
the
german
border
with
hamburg
for
our
port
on
the
way
to
the
frontier
we
stopped
for
a
farewell
visit
in
vilna
where
my
mother
had
a
brother
vilna
is
slighted
in
my
description
i
find
special
mention
of
only
two
things
the
and
the
bookstores
on
a
gray
wet
morning
in
early
april
we
set
out
for
the
frontier
this
was
the
real
beginning
of
our
journey
and
all
my
faculties
of
observation
were
alert
i
took
note
of
everything
the
weather
the
trains
the
bustle
of
railroad
stations
our
fellow
passengers
and
the
family
mood
at
every
stage
of
our
progress
the
bags
and
bundles
which
composed
our
travelling
outfit
were
much
more
bulky
than
valuable
a
trifling
sum
of
money
the
steamer
ticket
and
the
foreign
passport
were
the
magic
agents
by
means
of
which
we
hoped
to
span
the
five
thousand
miles
of
earth
and
water
between
us
and
my
father
the
passport
was
supposed
to
pass
us
over
the
frontier
without
any
trouble
but
on
account
of
the
prevalence
of
cholera
in
some
parts
of
the
country
the
poorer
sort
of
travellers
such
as
emigrants
were
subjected
at
this
time
to
more
than
ordinary
supervision
and
regulation
at
versbolovo
the
last
station
on
the
russian
side
we
met
the
first
of
our
troubles
a
german
physician
and
several
gendarmes
boarded
the
train
and
put
us
through
a
searching
examination
as
to
our
health
destination
and
financial
resources
as
a
result
of
the
inquisition
we
were
informed
that
we
would
not
be
allowed
to
cross
the
frontier
unless
we
exchanged
our
steamer
ticket
for
which
would
require
two
hundred
rubles
more
than
we
possessed
our
passport
was
taken
from
us
and
we
were
to
be
turned
back
on
our
journey
my
letter
describes
the
situation
we
were
homeless
houseless
and
friendless
in
a
strange
place
we
had
hardly
money
enough
to
last
us
through
the
voyage
for
which
we
had
hoped
and
waited
for
three
long
years
we
had
suffered
much
that
the
reunion
we
longed
for
might
come
about
we
had
prepared
ourselves
to
suffer
more
in
order
to
bring
it
about
and
had
parted
with
those
we
loved
with
places
that
were
dear
to
us
in
spite
of
what
we
passed
through
in
them
never
again
to
see
them
as
we
were
convinced
all
for
the
same
dear
end
with
strong
hopes
and
high
spirits
that
hid
the
sad
parting
we
had
started
on
our
long
journey
and
now
we
were
checked
so
unexpectedly
but
surely
the
blow
coming
from
where
we
little
expected
it
being
as
we
believed
safe
in
that
quarter
when
my
mother
had
recovered
enough
to
speak
she
began
to
argue
with
the
gendarme
telling
him
our
story
and
begging
him
to
be
kind
the
children
were
frightened
and
all
but
i
cried
i
was
only
wondering
what
would
happen
moved
by
our
distress
the
german
officers
gave
us
the
best
advice
they
could
we
were
to
get
out
at
the
station
of
kibart
on
the
russian
side
and
apply
to
one
herr
schidorsky
who
might
help
us
on
our
way
the
letter
goes
on
we
are
in
kibart
at
the
depot
the
least
important
particular
even
of
that
place
i
noticed
and
remembered
how
the
porter
he
was
an
ugly
grinning
man
carried
in
our
things
and
put
them
away
in
the
southern
corner
of
the
big
room
on
the
floor
how
we
sat
down
on
a
settee
near
them
a
yellow
settee
how
the
glass
roof
let
in
so
much
light
that
we
had
to
shade
our
eyes
because
the
car
had
been
dark
and
we
had
been
crying
how
there
were
only
a
few
people
besides
ourselves
there
and
how
i
began
to
count
them
and
stopped
when
i
noticed
a
sign
over
the
head
of
the
fifth
person
a
little
woman
with
a
red
nose
and
a
pimple
on
it
and
tried
to
read
the
german
with
the
aid
of
the
russian
translation
below
i
noticed
all
this
and
remembered
it
as
if
there
were
nothing
else
in
the
world
for
me
to
think
of
the
letter
dwells
gratefully
on
the
kindness
of
herr
schidorsky
who
became
the
agent
of
our
salvation
he
procured
my
mother
a
pass
to
eidtkuhnen
the
german
frontier
station
where
his
older
brother
as
chairman
of
a
emigrant
aid
association
arranged
for
our
admission
into
germany
during
the
negotiations
which
took
several
days
the
good
man
of
kibart
entertained
us
in
his
own
house
shabby
emigrants
though
we
were
the
schidorsky
brothers
were
jews
but
it
is
not
on
that
account
that
their
name
has
been
lovingly
remembered
for
fifteen
years
in
my
family
on
the
german
side
our
course
joined
that
of
many
other
emigrant
groups
on
their
way
to
hamburg
and
other
ports
we
were
a
clumsy
enough
crowd
with
wide
unsophisticated
eyes
with
awkward
bundles
hugged
in
our
arms
and
our
hearts
set
on
america
the
letter
to
my
uncle
faithfully
describes
every
stage
of
our
bustling
progress
here
is
a
sample
scene
of
many
that
i
recorded
there
was
a
terrible
confusion
in
the
where
we
were
directed
to
go
boxes
baskets
bags
valises
and
great
shapeless
things
belonging
to
no
particular
class
were
thrown
about
by
porters
and
other
men
who
sorted
them
and
put
tickets
on
all
but
those
containing
provisions
while
others
were
opened
and
examined
in
haste
at
last
our
turn
came
and
our
things
along
with
those
of
all
other
travellers
were
taken
away
to
be
steamed
and
smoked
and
other
such
processes
gone
through
we
were
told
to
wait
till
notice
should
be
given
us
of
something
else
to
be
done
the
phrases
we
were
told
to
do
this
and
told
to
do
that
occur
again
and
again
in
my
narrative
and
the
most
effective
handling
of
the
facts
could
give
no
more
vivid
picture
of
the
proceedings
we
emigrants
were
herded
at
the
stations
packed
in
the
cars
and
driven
from
place
to
place
like
cattle
at
the
expected
hour
we
all
tried
to
find
room
in
a
car
indicated
by
the
conductor
we
tried
but
could
only
find
enough
space
on
the
floor
for
our
baggage
on
which
we
sitting
comfortably
for
now
we
were
obliged
to
exchange
the
comparative
comforts
of
a
passenger
train
for
the
certain
discomforts
of
a
one
there
were
only
four
narrow
benches
in
the
whole
car
and
about
twice
as
many
people
were
already
seated
on
these
as
they
were
probably
supposed
to
accommodate
all
other
space
to
the
last
inch
was
crowded
by
passengers
or
their
luggage
it
was
very
hot
and
close
and
altogether
uncomfortable
and
still
at
every
new
station
fresh
passengers
came
crowding
in
and
actually
made
room
spare
as
it
was
for
themselves
it
became
so
terrible
that
all
glared
madly
at
the
conductor
as
he
allowed
more
people
to
come
into
that
prison
and
trembled
at
the
announcement
of
every
station
i
can
not
see
even
now
how
the
officers
could
allow
such
a
thing
it
was
really
dangerous
the
following
is
my
attempt
to
describe
a
flying
glimpse
of
a
metropolis
towards
evening
we
came
into
berlin
i
grow
dizzy
even
now
when
i
think
of
our
whirling
through
that
city
it
seemed
we
were
going
faster
and
faster
all
the
time
but
it
was
only
the
whirl
of
trains
passing
in
opposite
directions
and
close
to
us
that
made
it
seem
so
the
sight
of
crowds
of
people
such
as
we
had
never
seen
before
hurrying
to
and
fro
in
and
out
of
great
depots
that
danced
past
us
helped
to
make
it
more
so
strange
sights
splendid
buildings
shops
people
and
animals
all
mingled
in
one
great
confused
mass
of
a
disposition
to
continually
move
in
a
great
hurry
wildly
with
no
other
aim
but
to
make
one
head
go
round
and
round
in
following
its
dreadful
motions
round
and
round
went
my
head
it
was
nothing
but
trains
depots
crowds
crowds
depots
trains
again
and
again
with
no
beginning
no
end
only
a
mad
dance
faster
and
faster
we
go
faster
still
and
the
noise
increases
with
the
speed
bells
whistles
hammers
locomotives
shrieking
madly
men
voices
peddlers
cries
horses
hoofs
barkings
all
united
in
doing
their
best
to
drown
every
other
sound
but
their
own
and
made
such
a
deafening
uproar
in
the
attempt
that
nothing
could
keep
it
out
the
plight
of
the
bewildered
emigrant
on
the
way
to
foreign
parts
is
always
pitiful
enough
but
for
us
who
came
from
russia
the
terrors
of
the
way
were
doubled
in
a
great
lonely
field
opposite
a
solitary
house
within
a
large
yard
our
train
pulled
up
at
last
and
a
conductor
commanded
the
passengers
to
make
haste
and
get
out
he
need
not
have
told
us
to
hurry
we
were
glad
enough
to
be
free
again
after
such
a
long
imprisonment
in
the
uncomfortable
car
all
rushed
to
the
door
we
breathed
more
freely
in
the
open
field
but
the
conductor
did
not
wait
for
us
to
enjoy
our
freedom
he
hurried
us
into
the
one
large
room
which
made
up
the
house
and
then
into
the
yard
here
a
great
many
men
and
women
dressed
in
white
received
us
the
women
attending
to
the
women
and
girls
of
the
passengers
and
the
men
to
the
others
this
was
another
scene
of
bewildering
confusion
parents
losing
their
children
and
little
ones
crying
baggage
being
thrown
together
in
one
corner
of
the
yard
heedless
of
contents
which
suffered
in
consequence
those
germans
shouting
commands
always
accompanied
with
quick
quick
the
confused
passengers
obeying
all
orders
like
meek
children
only
questioning
now
and
then
what
was
going
to
be
done
with
them
and
no
wonder
if
in
some
minds
stories
arose
of
people
being
captured
by
robbers
murderers
and
the
like
here
we
had
been
taken
to
a
lonely
place
where
only
that
house
was
to
be
seen
our
things
were
taken
away
our
friends
separated
from
us
a
man
came
to
inspect
us
as
if
to
ascertain
our
full
value
people
driving
us
about
like
dumb
animals
helpless
and
unresisting
children
we
could
not
see
crying
in
a
way
that
suggested
terrible
things
ourselves
driven
into
a
little
room
where
a
great
kettle
was
boiling
on
a
little
stove
our
clothes
taken
off
our
bodies
rubbed
with
a
slippery
substance
that
might
be
any
bad
thing
a
shower
of
warm
water
let
down
on
us
without
warning
again
driven
to
another
little
room
where
we
sit
wrapped
in
woollen
blankets
till
large
coarse
bags
are
brought
in
their
contents
turned
out
and
we
see
only
a
cloud
of
steam
and
hear
the
women
orders
to
dress
ourselves
quick
quick
or
else
we
miss
something
we
can
not
hear
we
are
forced
to
pick
out
our
clothes
from
among
all
the
others
with
the
steam
blinding
us
we
choke
cough
entreat
the
women
to
give
us
time
they
persist
quick
quick
or
you
miss
the
train
oh
so
we
really
wo
be
murdered
they
are
only
making
us
ready
for
the
continuing
of
our
journey
cleaning
us
of
all
suspicions
of
dangerous
sickness
thank
god
in
polotzk
if
the
cholera
broke
out
as
it
did
once
or
twice
in
every
generation
we
made
no
such
fuss
as
did
these
germans
those
who
died
of
the
sickness
were
buried
and
those
who
lived
ran
to
the
synagogues
to
pray
we
travellers
felt
hurt
at
the
way
the
germans
treated
us
my
mother
nearly
died
of
cholera
once
but
she
was
given
a
new
name
a
lucky
one
which
saved
her
and
that
was
when
she
was
a
small
girl
none
of
us
were
sick
now
yet
hear
how
we
were
treated
those
gendarmes
and
nurses
always
shouted
their
commands
at
us
from
a
distance
as
fearful
of
our
touch
as
if
we
had
been
lepers
we
arrived
in
hamburg
early
one
morning
after
a
long
night
in
the
crowded
cars
we
were
marched
up
to
a
strange
vehicle
long
and
narrow
and
high
drawn
by
two
horses
and
commanded
by
a
mute
driver
we
were
piled
up
on
this
wagon
our
baggage
was
thrown
after
us
and
we
started
on
a
tour
across
the
city
of
hamburg
the
sights
i
faithfully
enumerate
for
the
benefit
of
my
uncle
include
little
carts
drawn
by
dogs
and
big
cars
that
run
of
themselves
later
identified
as
electric
cars
the
humorous
side
of
our
adventures
did
not
escape
me
again
and
again
i
come
across
a
laugh
in
the
long
pages
of
the
historic
epistle
the
description
of
the
ride
through
hamburg
ends
with
this
the
was
not
all
on
our
side
i
noticed
many
people
stopping
to
look
at
us
as
if
amused
though
most
passed
by
us
as
though
used
to
such
sights
we
did
make
a
queer
appearance
all
in
a
long
row
up
above
people
heads
in
fact
we
looked
like
a
flock
of
giant
fowls
roosting
only
wide
awake
the
smiles
and
shivers
fairly
crowded
each
other
in
some
parts
of
our
career
suddenly
when
everything
interesting
seemed
at
an
end
we
all
recollected
how
long
it
was
since
we
had
started
on
our
funny
ride
hours
we
thought
and
still
the
horses
ran
now
we
rode
through
quieter
streets
where
there
were
fewer
shops
and
more
wooden
houses
still
the
horses
seemed
to
have
but
just
started
i
looked
over
our
perch
again
something
made
me
think
of
a
description
i
had
read
of
criminals
being
carried
on
long
journeys
in
uncomfortable
things
like
this
well
it
was
strange
this
long
long
drive
the
conveyance
no
word
of
explanation
and
all
though
going
different
ways
being
packed
off
together
we
were
strangers
the
driver
knew
it
he
might
take
us
anywhere
how
could
we
tell
i
was
frightened
again
as
in
berlin
the
faces
around
me
confessed
the
same
yes
we
are
frightened
we
are
very
still
some
polish
women
over
there
have
fallen
asleep
and
the
rest
of
us
look
such
a
picture
of
woe
and
yet
so
funny
it
is
a
sight
to
see
and
remember
our
mysterious
ride
came
to
an
end
on
the
outskirts
of
the
city
where
we
were
once
more
lined
up
disinfected
labelled
and
pigeonholed
this
was
one
of
the
occasions
when
we
suspected
that
we
were
the
victims
of
a
conspiracy
to
extort
money
from
us
for
here
as
at
every
repetition
of
the
purifying
operations
we
had
undergone
a
fee
was
levied
on
us
so
much
per
head
my
mother
indeed
seeing
her
tiny
hoard
melting
away
had
long
since
sold
some
articles
from
our
baggage
to
a
fellow
passenger
richer
than
she
but
even
so
she
did
not
have
enough
money
to
pay
the
fee
demanded
of
her
in
hamburg
her
statement
was
not
accepted
and
we
all
suffered
the
last
indignity
of
having
our
persons
searched
this
last
place
of
detention
turned
out
to
be
a
prison
quarantine
they
called
it
and
there
was
a
great
deal
of
it
two
weeks
of
it
two
weeks
within
high
brick
walls
several
hundred
of
us
herded
in
half
a
dozen
compartments
numbered
compartments
sleeping
in
rows
like
sick
people
in
a
hospital
with
morning
and
night
and
short
rations
three
times
a
day
with
never
a
sign
of
the
free
world
beyond
our
barred
windows
with
anxiety
and
longing
and
homesickness
in
our
hearts
and
in
our
ears
the
unfamiliar
voice
of
the
invisible
ocean
which
drew
and
repelled
us
at
the
same
time
the
fortnight
in
quarantine
was
not
an
episode
it
was
an
epoch
divisible
into
eras
periods
events
the
greatest
event
was
the
arrival
of
some
ship
to
take
some
of
the
waiting
passengers
when
the
gates
were
opened
and
the
lucky
ones
said
those
left
behind
felt
hopeless
of
ever
seeing
the
gates
open
for
them
it
was
both
pleasant
and
painful
for
the
strangers
grew
to
be
fast
friends
in
a
day
and
really
rejoiced
in
each
other
fortune
but
the
regretful
envy
could
not
be
helped
either
our
turn
came
at
last
we
were
conducted
through
the
gate
of
departure
and
after
some
hours
of
bewildering
manœuvres
described
in
great
detail
in
the
report
to
my
uncle
we
found
ourselves
we
five
frightened
pilgrims
from
polotzk
on
the
deck
of
a
great
big
steamship
afloat
on
the
strange
big
waters
of
the
ocean
for
sixteen
days
the
ship
was
our
world
my
letter
dwells
solemnly
on
the
details
of
the
life
at
sea
as
if
afraid
to
cheat
my
uncle
of
the
smallest
circumstance
it
does
not
shrink
from
describing
the
torments
of
seasickness
it
notes
every
change
in
the
weather
a
rough
night
is
described
when
the
ship
pitched
and
rolled
so
that
people
were
thrown
from
their
berths
days
and
nights
when
we
crawled
through
dense
fogs
our
foghorn
drawing
answering
warnings
from
invisible
ships
the
perils
of
the
sea
were
not
minimized
in
the
imaginations
of
us
inexperienced
voyagers
the
captain
and
his
officers
ate
their
dinners
smoked
their
pipes
and
slept
soundly
in
their
turns
while
we
frightened
emigrants
turned
our
faces
to
the
wall
and
awaited
our
watery
graves
all
this
while
the
seasickness
lasted
then
came
happy
hours
on
deck
with
fugitive
sunshine
birds
atop
the
crested
waves
band
music
and
dancing
and
fun
i
explored
the
ship
made
friends
with
officers
and
crew
or
pursued
my
thoughts
in
quiet
nooks
it
was
my
first
experience
of
the
ocean
and
i
was
profoundly
moved
oh
what
solemn
thoughts
i
had
how
deeply
i
felt
the
greatness
the
power
of
the
scene
the
immeasurable
distance
from
horizon
to
horizon
the
huge
billows
forever
changing
their
shapes
now
only
a
wavy
and
rolling
plain
now
a
chain
of
great
mountains
coming
and
going
farther
away
then
a
town
in
the
distance
perhaps
with
spires
and
towers
and
buildings
of
gigantic
dimensions
and
mostly
a
vast
mass
of
uncertain
shapes
knocking
against
each
other
in
fury
and
seething
and
foaming
in
their
anger
the
gray
sky
with
its
mountains
of
gloomy
clouds
flying
moving
with
the
waves
as
it
seemed
very
near
them
the
absence
of
any
object
besides
the
one
ship
and
the
deep
solemn
groans
of
the
sea
sounding
as
if
all
the
voices
of
the
world
had
been
turned
into
sighs
and
then
gathered
into
that
one
mournful
sound
so
deeply
did
i
feel
the
presence
of
these
things
that
the
feeling
became
one
of
awe
both
painful
and
sweet
and
stirring
and
warming
and
deep
and
calm
and
grand
i
would
imagine
myself
all
alone
on
the
ocean
and
robinson
crusoe
was
very
real
to
me
i
was
alone
sometimes
i
was
aware
of
no
human
presence
i
was
conscious
only
of
sea
and
sky
and
something
i
did
not
understand
and
as
i
listened
to
its
solemn
voice
i
felt
as
if
i
had
found
a
friend
and
knew
that
i
loved
the
ocean
it
seemed
as
if
it
were
within
as
well
as
without
part
of
myself
and
i
wondered
how
i
had
lived
without
it
and
if
i
could
ever
part
with
it
and
so
suffering
fearing
brooding
rejoicing
we
crept
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
coveted
shore
until
on
a
glorious
may
morning
six
weeks
after
our
departure
from
polotzk
our
eyes
beheld
the
promised
land
and
my
father
received
us
in
his
arms
chapter
ix
the
promised
land
having
made
such
good
time
across
the
ocean
i
ought
to
be
able
to
proceed
no
less
rapidly
on
where
after
all
i
am
more
at
home
and
yet
here
is
where
i
falter
not
that
i
hesitated
even
for
the
space
of
a
breath
in
my
first
steps
in
america
there
was
no
time
to
hesitate
the
most
ignorant
immigrant
on
landing
proceeds
to
give
and
receive
greetings
to
eat
sleep
and
rise
after
the
manner
of
his
own
country
wherein
he
is
corrected
admonished
and
laughed
at
whether
by
interested
friends
or
the
most
indifferent
strangers
and
his
american
experience
is
thus
begun
the
process
is
spontaneous
on
all
sides
like
the
education
of
the
child
by
the
family
circle
but
while
the
most
stupid
nursery
maid
is
able
to
contribute
her
part
toward
the
result
we
do
not
expect
an
analysis
of
the
process
to
be
furnished
by
any
member
of
the
family
least
of
all
by
the
engaging
infant
the
philosophical
maiden
aunt
alone
or
some
other
witness
equally
psychological
and
aloof
is
able
to
trace
the
myriad
efforts
by
which
the
little
johnnie
or
nellie
acquires
a
secure
hold
on
the
disjointed
parts
of
the
huge
plaything
life
now
i
was
not
exactly
an
infant
when
i
was
set
down
on
a
may
day
some
fifteen
years
ago
in
this
pleasant
nursery
of
america
i
had
long
since
acquired
the
use
of
my
faculties
and
had
collected
some
bits
of
experience
practical
and
emotional
and
had
even
learned
to
give
an
account
of
them
still
i
had
very
little
perspective
and
my
observations
and
comparisons
were
superficial
i
was
too
much
carried
away
to
analyze
the
forces
that
were
moving
me
my
polotzk
i
knew
well
before
i
began
to
judge
it
and
experiment
with
it
america
was
bewilderingly
strange
unimaginably
complex
delightfully
unexplored
i
rushed
impetuously
out
of
the
cage
of
my
provincialism
and
looked
eagerly
about
the
brilliant
universe
my
question
was
what
have
we
here
not
what
does
this
mean
that
query
came
much
later
when
i
now
become
retrospectively
introspective
i
fall
into
the
predicament
of
the
centipede
in
the
rhyme
who
got
along
very
smoothly
until
he
was
asked
which
leg
came
after
which
whereupon
he
became
so
rattled
that
he
could
take
a
step
i
know
i
have
come
on
a
thousand
feet
on
wings
winds
and
american
machines
i
have
leaped
and
run
and
climbed
and
crawled
but
to
tell
which
step
came
after
which
i
find
a
puzzling
matter
plenty
of
maiden
aunts
were
present
during
my
second
infancy
in
the
guise
of
immigrant
officials
settlement
workers
and
sundry
other
unprejudiced
and
critical
observers
their
statistics
i
might
properly
borrow
to
fill
the
gaps
in
my
recollections
but
i
am
prevented
by
my
sense
of
harmony
the
individual
we
know
is
a
creature
unknown
to
the
statistician
whereas
i
undertook
to
give
the
personal
view
of
everything
so
i
am
bound
to
unravel
as
well
as
i
can
the
tangle
of
events
outer
and
inner
which
made
up
the
first
breathless
years
of
my
american
life
during
his
three
years
of
probation
my
father
had
made
a
number
of
false
starts
in
business
his
history
for
that
period
is
the
history
of
thousands
who
come
to
america
like
him
with
pockets
empty
hands
untrained
to
the
use
of
tools
minds
cramped
by
centuries
of
repression
in
their
native
land
dozens
of
these
men
pass
under
your
eyes
every
day
my
american
friend
too
absorbed
in
their
honest
affairs
to
notice
the
looks
of
suspicion
which
you
cast
at
them
the
repugnance
with
which
you
shrink
from
their
touch
you
see
them
shuffle
from
door
to
door
with
a
basket
of
spools
and
buttons
or
bending
over
the
sizzling
irons
in
a
basement
tailor
shop
or
rummaging
in
your
ash
can
or
moving
a
pushcart
from
curb
to
curb
at
the
command
of
the
burly
policeman
the
jew
peddler
you
say
and
dismiss
him
from
your
premises
and
from
your
thoughts
never
dreaming
that
the
sordid
drama
of
his
days
may
have
a
moral
that
concerns
you
what
if
the
creature
with
the
untidy
beard
carries
in
his
bosom
his
citizenship
papers
what
if
the
tailor
is
supporting
a
boy
in
college
who
is
one
day
going
to
mend
your
state
constitution
for
you
what
if
the
ragpicker
daughters
are
hastening
over
the
ocean
to
teach
your
children
in
the
public
schools
think
every
time
you
pass
the
greasy
alien
on
the
street
that
he
was
born
thousands
of
years
before
the
oldest
native
american
and
he
may
have
something
to
communicate
to
you
when
you
two
shall
have
learned
a
common
language
remember
that
his
very
physiognomy
is
a
cipher
the
key
to
which
it
behooves
you
to
search
for
most
diligently
by
the
time
we
joined
my
father
he
had
surveyed
many
avenues
of
approach
toward
the
coveted
citadel
of
fortune
one
of
these
heretofore
untried
he
now
proposed
to
essay
armed
with
new
courage
and
cheered
on
by
the
presence
of
his
family
in
partnership
with
an
energetic
little
man
who
had
an
english
chapter
in
his
history
he
prepared
to
set
up
a
refreshment
booth
on
crescent
beach
but
while
he
was
completing
arrangements
at
the
beach
we
remained
in
town
where
we
enjoyed
the
educational
advantages
of
a
thickly
populated
neighborhood
namely
wall
street
in
the
west
end
of
boston
anybody
who
knows
boston
knows
that
the
west
and
north
ends
are
the
wrong
ends
of
that
city
they
form
the
tenement
district
or
in
the
newer
phrase
the
slums
of
boston
anybody
who
is
acquainted
with
the
slums
of
any
american
metropolis
knows
that
that
is
the
quarter
where
poor
immigrants
foregather
to
live
for
the
most
part
as
unkempt
toiling
unaspiring
foreigners
pitiful
in
the
eyes
of
social
missionaries
the
despair
of
boards
of
health
the
hope
of
ward
politicians
the
touchstone
of
american
democracy
the
metropolitan
knows
the
slums
as
a
sort
of
house
of
detention
for
poor
aliens
where
they
live
on
probation
till
they
can
show
a
certificate
of
good
citizenship
he
may
know
all
this
and
yet
not
guess
how
wall
street
in
the
west
end
appears
in
the
eyes
of
a
little
immigrant
from
polotzk
what
would
the
sophisticated
say
about
union
place
off
wall
street
where
my
new
home
waited
for
me
he
would
say
that
it
is
no
place
at
all
but
a
short
box
of
an
alley
two
rows
of
tenements
are
its
sides
a
stingy
strip
of
sky
is
its
lid
a
littered
pavement
is
the
floor
and
a
narrow
mouth
its
exit
but
i
saw
a
very
different
picture
on
my
introduction
to
union
place
i
saw
two
imposing
rows
of
brick
buildings
loftier
than
any
dwelling
i
had
ever
lived
in
brick
was
even
on
the
ground
for
me
to
tread
on
instead
of
common
earth
or
boards
many
friendly
windows
stood
open
filled
with
uncovered
heads
of
women
and
children
i
thought
the
people
were
interested
in
us
which
was
very
neighborly
i
looked
up
to
the
topmost
row
of
windows
and
my
eyes
were
filled
with
the
may
blue
of
an
american
sky
in
our
days
of
affluence
in
russia
we
had
been
accustomed
to
upholstered
parlors
embroidered
linen
silver
spoons
and
candlesticks
goblets
of
gold
kitchen
shelves
shining
with
copper
and
brass
we
had
featherbeds
heaped
halfway
to
the
ceiling
we
had
clothes
presses
dusky
with
velvet
and
silk
and
fine
woollen
the
three
small
rooms
into
which
my
father
now
ushered
us
up
one
flight
of
stairs
contained
only
the
necessary
beds
with
lean
mattresses
a
few
wooden
chairs
a
table
or
two
a
mysterious
iron
structure
which
later
turned
out
to
be
a
stove
a
couple
of
unornamental
kerosene
lamps
and
a
scanty
array
of
and
crockery
and
yet
we
were
all
impressed
with
our
new
home
and
its
furniture
it
was
not
only
because
we
had
just
passed
through
our
seven
lean
years
cooking
in
earthen
vessels
eating
black
bread
on
holidays
and
wearing
cotton
it
was
chiefly
because
these
wooden
chairs
and
tin
pans
were
american
chairs
and
pans
that
they
shone
glorious
in
our
eyes
and
if
there
was
anything
lacking
for
comfort
or
decoration
we
expected
it
to
be
presently
supplied
at
least
we
children
did
perhaps
my
mother
alone
of
us
newcomers
appreciated
the
shabbiness
of
the
little
apartment
and
realized
that
for
her
there
was
as
yet
no
laying
down
of
the
burden
of
poverty
our
initiation
into
american
ways
began
with
the
first
step
on
the
new
soil
my
father
found
occasion
to
instruct
or
correct
us
even
on
the
way
from
the
pier
to
wall
street
which
journey
we
made
crowded
together
in
a
rickety
cab
he
told
us
not
to
lean
out
of
the
windows
not
to
point
and
explained
the
word
greenhorn
we
did
not
want
to
be
greenhorns
and
gave
the
strictest
attention
to
my
instructions
i
do
not
know
when
my
parents
found
opportunity
to
review
together
the
history
of
polotzk
in
the
three
years
past
for
we
children
had
no
patience
with
the
subject
my
mother
narrative
was
constantly
interrupted
by
irrelevant
questions
interjections
and
explanations
illustration
union
place
boston
where
my
new
home
waited
for
me
the
first
meal
was
an
object
lesson
of
much
variety
my
father
produced
several
kinds
of
food
ready
to
eat
without
any
cooking
from
little
tin
cans
that
had
printing
all
over
them
he
attempted
to
introduce
us
to
a
queer
slippery
kind
of
fruit
which
he
called
banana
but
had
to
give
it
up
for
the
time
being
after
the
meal
he
had
better
luck
with
a
curious
piece
of
furniture
on
runners
which
he
called
there
were
five
of
us
newcomers
and
we
found
five
different
ways
of
getting
into
the
american
machine
of
perpetual
motion
and
as
many
ways
of
getting
out
of
it
one
born
and
bred
to
the
use
of
a
can
not
imagine
how
ludicrous
people
can
make
themselves
when
attempting
to
use
it
for
the
first
time
we
laughed
immoderately
over
our
various
experiments
with
the
novelty
which
was
a
wholesome
way
of
letting
off
steam
after
the
unusual
excitement
of
the
day
in
our
flat
we
did
not
think
of
such
a
thing
as
storing
the
coal
in
the
bathtub
there
was
no
bathtub
so
in
the
evening
of
the
first
day
my
father
conducted
us
to
the
public
baths
as
we
moved
along
in
a
little
procession
i
was
delighted
with
the
illumination
of
the
streets
so
many
lamps
and
they
burned
until
morning
my
father
said
and
so
people
did
not
need
to
carry
lanterns
in
america
then
everything
was
free
as
we
had
heard
in
russia
light
was
free
the
streets
were
as
bright
as
a
synagogue
on
a
holy
day
music
was
free
we
had
been
serenaded
to
our
gaping
delight
by
a
brass
band
of
many
pieces
soon
after
our
installation
on
union
place
education
was
free
that
subject
my
father
had
written
about
repeatedly
as
comprising
his
chief
hope
for
us
children
the
essence
of
american
opportunity
the
treasure
that
no
thief
could
touch
not
even
misfortune
or
poverty
it
was
the
one
thing
that
he
was
able
to
promise
us
when
he
sent
for
us
surer
safer
than
bread
or
shelter
on
our
second
day
i
was
thrilled
with
the
realization
of
what
this
freedom
of
education
meant
a
little
girl
from
across
the
alley
came
and
offered
to
conduct
us
to
school
my
father
was
out
but
we
five
between
us
had
a
few
words
of
english
by
this
time
we
knew
the
word
school
we
understood
this
child
who
had
never
seen
us
till
yesterday
who
could
not
pronounce
our
names
who
was
not
much
better
dressed
than
we
was
able
to
offer
us
the
freedom
of
the
schools
of
boston
no
application
made
no
questions
asked
no
examinations
rulings
exclusions
no
machinations
no
fees
the
doors
stood
open
for
every
one
of
us
the
smallest
child
could
show
us
the
way
this
incident
impressed
me
more
than
anything
i
had
heard
in
advance
of
the
freedom
of
education
in
america
it
was
a
concrete
proof
almost
the
thing
itself
one
had
to
experience
it
to
understand
it
it
was
a
great
disappointment
to
be
told
by
my
father
that
we
were
not
to
enter
upon
our
school
career
at
once
it
was
too
near
the
end
of
the
term
he
said
and
we
were
going
to
move
to
crescent
beach
in
a
week
or
so
we
had
to
wait
until
the
opening
of
the
schools
in
september
what
a
loss
of
precious
time
from
may
till
september
not
that
the
time
was
really
lost
even
the
interval
on
union
place
was
crowded
with
lessons
and
experiences
we
had
to
visit
the
stores
and
be
dressed
from
head
to
foot
in
american
clothing
we
had
to
learn
the
mysteries
of
the
iron
stove
the
washboard
and
the
we
had
to
learn
to
trade
with
the
fruit
peddler
through
the
window
and
not
to
be
afraid
of
the
policeman
and
above
all
we
had
to
learn
english
the
kind
people
who
assisted
us
in
these
important
matters
form
a
group
by
themselves
in
the
gallery
of
my
friends
if
i
had
never
seen
them
from
those
early
days
till
now
i
should
still
have
remembered
them
with
gratitude
when
i
enumerate
the
long
list
of
my
american
teachers
i
must
begin
with
those
who
came
to
us
on
wall
street
and
taught
us
our
first
steps
to
my
mother
in
her
perplexity
over
the
cookstove
the
woman
who
showed
her
how
to
make
the
fire
was
an
angel
of
deliverance
a
fairy
godmother
to
us
children
was
she
who
led
us
to
a
wonderful
country
called
uptown
where
in
a
dazzlingly
beautiful
palace
called
a
department
store
we
exchanged
our
hateful
homemade
european
costumes
which
pointed
us
out
as
greenhorns
to
the
children
on
the
street
for
real
american
garments
and
issued
forth
glorified
in
each
other
eyes
with
our
despised
immigrant
clothing
we
shed
also
our
impossible
hebrew
names
a
committee
of
our
friends
several
years
ahead
of
us
in
american
experience
put
their
heads
together
and
concocted
american
names
for
us
all
those
of
our
real
names
that
had
no
pleasing
american
equivalents
they
ruthlessly
discarded
content
if
they
retained
the
initials
my
mother
possessing
a
name
that
was
not
easily
translatable
was
punished
with
the
undignified
nickname
of
annie
fetchke
joseph
and
deborah
issued
as
frieda
joseph
and
dora
respectively
as
for
poor
me
i
was
simply
cheated
the
name
they
gave
me
was
hardly
new
my
hebrew
name
being
maryashe
in
full
mashke
for
short
russianized
into
marya
my
friends
said
that
it
would
hold
good
in
english
as
which
was
very
disappointing
as
i
longed
to
possess
a
american
name
like
the
others
i
am
forgetting
the
consolation
i
had
in
this
matter
of
names
from
the
use
of
my
surname
which
i
have
had
no
occasion
to
mention
until
now
i
found
on
my
arrival
that
my
father
was
antin
on
the
slightest
provocation
and
not
as
in
polotzk
on
state
occasions
alone
and
so
i
was
mary
antin
and
i
felt
very
important
to
answer
to
such
a
dignified
title
it
was
just
like
america
that
even
plain
people
should
wear
their
surnames
on
week
days
as
a
family
we
were
so
diligent
under
instruction
so
adaptable
and
so
clever
in
hiding
our
deficiencies
that
when
we
made
the
journey
to
crescent
beach
in
the
wake
of
our
small
of
household
goods
my
father
had
very
little
occasion
to
admonish
us
on
the
way
and
i
am
sure
he
was
not
ashamed
of
us
so
much
we
had
achieved
toward
our
americanization
during
the
two
weeks
since
our
landing
crescent
beach
is
a
name
that
is
printed
in
very
small
type
on
the
maps
of
the
environs
of
boston
but
a
strip
of
sand
curves
from
winthrop
to
lynn
and
that
is
historic
ground
in
the
annals
of
my
family
the
place
is
now
a
popular
resort
for
holiday
crowds
and
is
famous
under
the
name
of
revere
beach
when
the
reunited
antins
made
their
stand
there
however
there
were
no
boulevards
no
stately
no
hotels
no
gaudy
amusement
places
no
illuminations
no
showmen
no
tawdry
rabble
there
was
only
the
bright
clean
sweep
of
sand
the
summer
sea
and
the
summer
sky
at
high
tide
the
whole
atlantic
rushed
in
tossing
the
seaweeds
in
his
mane
at
low
tide
he
rushed
out
growling
and
gnashing
his
granite
teeth
between
tides
a
baby
might
play
on
the
beach
digging
with
pebbles
and
shells
till
it
lay
asleep
on
the
sand
the
whole
sun
shone
by
day
troops
of
stars
by
night
and
the
great
moon
in
its
season
into
this
grand
cycle
of
the
seaside
day
i
came
to
live
and
learn
and
play
a
few
people
came
with
me
as
i
have
already
intimated
but
the
main
thing
was
that
came
to
live
on
the
edge
of
the
sea
i
who
had
spent
my
life
inland
believing
that
the
great
waters
of
the
world
were
spread
out
before
me
in
the
dvina
my
idea
of
the
human
world
had
grown
enormously
during
the
long
journey
my
idea
of
the
earth
had
expanded
with
every
day
at
sea
my
idea
of
the
world
outside
the
earth
now
budded
and
swelled
during
my
prolonged
experience
of
the
wide
and
unobstructed
heavens
not
that
i
got
any
inkling
of
the
conception
of
a
multiple
world
i
had
had
no
lessons
in
cosmogony
and
i
had
no
spontaneous
revelation
of
the
true
position
of
the
earth
in
the
universe
for
me
as
for
my
fathers
the
sun
set
and
rose
and
i
did
not
feel
the
earth
rushing
through
space
but
i
lay
stretched
out
in
the
sun
my
eyes
level
with
the
sea
till
i
seemed
to
be
absorbed
bodily
by
the
very
materials
of
the
world
around
me
till
i
could
not
feel
my
hand
as
separate
from
the
warm
sand
in
which
it
was
buried
or
i
crouched
on
the
beach
at
full
moon
wondering
wondering
between
the
two
splendors
of
the
sky
and
the
sea
or
i
ran
out
to
meet
the
incoming
storm
my
face
full
in
the
wind
my
being
with
an
awesome
delight
to
the
tips
of
my
locks
flying
behind
and
stood
clinging
to
some
stake
or
upturned
boat
shaken
by
the
roar
and
rumble
of
the
waves
so
clinging
i
pretended
that
i
was
in
danger
and
was
deliciously
frightened
i
held
on
with
both
hands
and
shook
my
head
exulting
in
the
tumult
around
me
equally
ready
to
laugh
or
sob
or
else
i
sat
on
the
stillest
days
with
my
back
to
the
sea
not
looking
at
all
but
just
listening
to
the
rustle
of
the
waves
on
the
sand
not
thinking
at
all
but
just
breathing
with
the
sea
thus
courting
the
influence
of
sea
and
sky
and
variable
weather
i
was
bound
to
have
dreams
hints
imaginings
it
was
no
more
than
this
perhaps
that
the
world
as
i
knew
it
was
not
large
enough
to
contain
all
that
i
saw
and
felt
that
the
thoughts
that
flashed
through
my
mind
not
half
understood
unrelated
to
my
utterable
thoughts
concerned
something
for
which
i
had
as
yet
no
name
every
imaginative
growing
child
has
these
flashes
of
intuition
especially
one
that
becomes
intimate
with
some
one
aspect
of
nature
with
me
it
was
the
growing
time
that
idle
summer
by
the
sea
and
i
grew
all
the
faster
because
i
had
been
so
cramped
before
my
mind
too
had
so
recently
been
worked
upon
by
the
impressive
experience
of
a
change
of
country
that
i
was
more
than
commonly
alive
to
impressions
which
are
the
seeds
of
ideas
let
no
one
suppose
that
i
spent
my
time
entirely
or
even
chiefly
in
inspired
solitude
by
far
the
best
part
of
my
day
was
spent
in
play
frank
hearty
boisterous
play
such
as
comes
natural
to
american
children
in
polotzk
i
had
already
begun
to
be
considered
too
old
for
play
excepting
set
games
or
organized
frolics
here
i
found
myself
included
with
children
who
still
played
and
i
willingly
returned
to
childhood
there
were
plenty
of
playfellows
my
energetic
little
partner
had
a
little
wife
and
a
large
family
he
kept
them
in
the
little
cottage
next
to
ours
and
that
the
shanty
survived
the
tumultuous
presence
of
that
brood
is
a
wonder
to
me
the
young
wilners
included
an
assortment
of
boys
girls
and
twins
of
every
possible
variety
of
age
size
disposition
and
sex
they
swarmed
in
and
out
of
the
cottage
all
day
long
wearing
the
hollow
and
trampling
the
ground
to
powder
they
swung
out
of
windows
like
monkeys
slid
up
the
roof
like
flies
and
shot
out
of
trees
like
fowls
even
a
small
person
like
me
could
go
anywhere
without
being
run
over
by
a
wilner
and
i
could
never
tell
which
wilner
it
was
because
none
of
them
ever
stood
still
long
enough
to
be
identified
and
also
because
i
suspected
that
they
were
in
the
habit
of
interchanging
conspicuous
articles
of
clothing
which
was
very
confusing
you
would
suppose
that
the
little
mother
must
have
been
utterly
lost
bewildered
trodden
down
in
this
horde
of
urchins
but
you
are
mistaken
wilner
was
a
positively
majestic
little
person
she
ruled
her
brood
with
the
utmost
coolness
and
strictness
she
had
even
the
biggest
boy
under
her
thumb
frequently
under
her
palm
if
they
enjoyed
the
wildest
freedom
outdoors
indoors
the
young
wilners
lived
by
the
clock
and
so
at
five
in
the
evening
on
seven
days
in
the
week
my
father
partner
children
could
be
seen
in
two
long
rows
around
the
supper
table
you
could
tell
them
apart
on
this
occasion
because
they
all
had
their
faces
washed
and
this
is
the
time
to
count
them
there
are
twelve
little
wilners
at
table
i
managed
to
retain
my
identity
in
this
multitude
somehow
and
while
i
was
very
much
impressed
with
their
numbers
i
even
dared
to
pick
and
choose
my
friends
among
the
wilners
one
or
two
of
the
smaller
boys
i
liked
best
of
all
for
a
game
of
or
a
frolic
on
the
beach
we
played
in
the
water
like
ducks
never
taking
the
trouble
to
get
dry
one
day
i
waded
out
with
one
of
the
boys
to
see
which
of
us
dared
go
farthest
the
tide
was
extremely
low
and
we
had
not
wet
our
knees
when
we
began
to
look
back
to
see
if
familiar
objects
were
still
in
sight
i
thought
we
had
been
wading
for
hours
and
still
the
water
was
so
shallow
and
quiet
my
companion
was
marching
straight
ahead
so
i
did
the
same
suddenly
a
swell
lifted
us
almost
off
our
feet
and
we
clutched
at
each
other
simultaneously
there
was
a
lesser
swell
and
little
waves
began
to
run
and
a
sigh
went
up
from
the
sea
the
tide
was
turning
perhaps
a
storm
was
on
the
way
and
we
were
miles
dreadful
miles
from
dry
land
boy
and
girl
turned
without
a
word
four
determined
bare
legs
ploughing
through
the
water
four
scared
eyes
straining
toward
the
land
through
an
eternity
of
toil
and
fear
they
kept
dumbly
on
death
at
their
heels
pride
still
in
their
hearts
at
last
they
reach
mark
six
hours
before
full
tide
each
has
seen
the
other
afraid
and
each
rejoices
in
the
knowledge
but
only
the
boy
is
sure
of
his
tongue
you
was
scared
war
you
he
taunts
the
girl
understands
so
much
and
is
able
to
reply
you
can
schwimmen
i
not
betcher
life
i
can
schwimmen
the
other
mocks
and
the
girl
walks
off
angry
and
hurt
an
i
can
walk
on
my
hands
the
tormentor
calls
after
her
say
you
greenhorn
why
look
the
girl
keeps
straight
on
vowing
that
she
would
never
walk
with
that
rude
boy
again
neither
by
land
nor
sea
not
even
though
the
waters
should
part
at
his
bidding
i
am
forgetting
the
more
serious
business
which
had
brought
us
to
crescent
beach
while
we
children
disported
ourselves
like
mermaids
and
mermen
in
the
surf
our
respective
fathers
dispensed
cold
lemonade
hot
peanuts
and
pink
popcorn
and
piled
up
our
respective
fortunes
nickel
by
nickel
penny
by
penny
i
was
very
proud
of
my
connection
with
the
public
life
of
the
beach
i
admired
greatly
our
shining
soda
fountain
the
rows
of
sparkling
glasses
the
pyramids
of
oranges
the
sausage
chains
the
neat
white
counter
and
the
bright
array
of
tin
spoons
it
seemed
to
me
that
none
of
the
other
refreshment
stands
on
the
beach
there
were
a
few
were
half
so
attractive
as
ours
i
thought
my
father
looked
very
well
in
a
long
white
apron
and
shirt
sleeves
he
dished
out
ice
cream
with
enthusiasm
so
i
supposed
he
was
getting
rich
it
never
occurred
to
me
to
compare
his
present
occupation
with
the
position
for
which
he
had
been
originally
destined
or
if
i
thought
about
it
i
was
just
as
well
content
for
by
this
time
i
had
by
heart
my
father
saying
america
is
not
polotzk
all
occupations
were
respectable
all
men
were
equal
in
america
if
i
admired
the
soda
fountain
and
the
sausage
chains
i
almost
worshipped
the
partner
wilner
i
was
content
to
stand
for
an
hour
at
a
time
watching
him
make
potato
chips
in
his
cook
cap
and
apron
with
a
ladle
in
his
hand
and
a
smile
on
his
face
he
moved
about
with
the
greatest
agility
whisking
his
raw
materials
out
of
nowhere
dipping
into
his
bubbling
kettle
with
a
flourish
and
bringing
forth
the
finished
product
with
a
caper
such
potato
chips
were
not
to
be
had
anywhere
else
on
crescent
beach
thin
as
tissue
paper
crisp
as
dry
snow
and
salt
as
the
sea
such
potato
chips
only
wilner
could
make
on
holidays
when
dozens
of
family
parties
came
out
by
every
train
from
town
he
could
hardly
keep
up
with
the
demand
for
his
potato
chips
and
with
a
waiting
crowd
around
him
our
partner
was
at
his
best
he
was
as
voluble
as
he
was
skilful
and
as
witty
as
he
was
voluble
at
least
so
i
guessed
from
the
laughter
that
frequently
drowned
his
voice
i
could
not
understand
his
jokes
but
if
i
could
get
near
enough
to
watch
his
lips
and
his
smile
and
his
merry
eyes
i
was
happy
that
any
one
could
talk
so
fast
and
in
english
was
marvel
enough
but
that
this
prodigy
should
belong
to
establishment
was
a
fact
to
thrill
me
i
had
never
seen
anything
like
wilner
except
a
wedding
jester
but
then
he
spoke
common
yiddish
so
proud
was
i
of
the
talent
and
good
taste
displayed
at
our
stand
that
if
my
father
beckoned
to
me
in
the
crowd
and
sent
me
on
an
errand
i
hoped
the
people
noticed
that
i
too
was
connected
with
the
establishment
and
all
this
splendor
and
glory
and
distinction
came
to
a
sudden
end
there
was
some
trouble
about
a
license
some
fee
or
fine
there
was
a
storm
in
the
night
that
damaged
the
soda
fountain
and
other
fixtures
there
was
talk
and
consultation
between
the
houses
of
antin
and
wilner
and
the
promising
partnership
was
dissolved
no
more
would
the
merry
partner
gather
the
crowd
on
the
beach
no
more
would
the
twelve
young
wilners
gambol
like
mermen
and
mermaids
in
the
surf
and
the
less
numerous
tribe
of
antin
must
also
say
farewell
to
the
jolly
seaside
life
for
men
in
such
humble
business
as
my
father
carry
their
families
along
with
their
other
earthly
goods
wherever
they
go
after
the
manner
of
the
gypsies
we
had
driven
a
feeble
stake
into
the
sand
the
jealous
atlantic
in
conspiracy
with
the
sunday
law
had
torn
it
out
we
must
seek
our
luck
elsewhere
in
polotzk
we
had
supposed
that
america
was
practically
synonymous
with
boston
when
we
landed
in
boston
the
horizon
was
pushed
back
and
we
annexed
crescent
beach
and
now
espying
other
lands
of
promise
we
took
possession
of
the
province
of
chelsea
in
the
name
of
our
necessity
in
chelsea
as
in
boston
we
made
our
stand
in
the
wrong
end
of
the
town
arlington
street
was
inhabited
by
poor
jews
poor
negroes
and
a
sprinkling
of
poor
irish
the
side
streets
leading
from
it
were
occupied
by
more
poor
jews
and
negroes
it
was
a
proper
locality
for
a
man
without
capital
to
do
business
my
father
rented
a
tenement
with
a
store
in
the
basement
he
put
in
a
few
barrels
of
flour
and
of
sugar
a
few
boxes
of
crackers
a
few
gallons
of
kerosene
an
assortment
of
soap
of
the
save
the
coupon
brands
in
the
cellar
a
few
barrels
of
potatoes
and
a
pyramid
of
in
the
showcase
an
alluring
display
of
penny
candy
he
put
out
his
sign
with
a
warning
of
strictly
cash
and
proceeded
to
give
credit
indiscriminately
that
was
the
regular
way
to
do
business
on
arlington
street
my
father
in
his
three
years
apprenticeship
had
learned
the
tricks
of
many
trades
he
knew
when
and
how
to
bluff
the
legend
of
strictly
cash
was
a
protection
against
notoriously
irresponsible
customers
while
none
of
the
good
customers
who
had
a
record
for
paying
regularly
on
saturday
hesitated
to
enter
the
store
with
empty
purses
if
my
father
knew
the
tricks
of
the
trade
my
mother
could
be
counted
on
to
throw
all
her
talent
and
tact
into
the
business
of
course
she
had
no
english
yet
but
as
she
could
perform
the
acts
of
weighing
measuring
and
mental
computation
of
fractions
mechanically
she
was
able
to
give
her
whole
attention
to
the
dark
mysteries
of
the
language
as
intercourse
with
her
customers
gave
her
opportunity
in
this
she
made
such
rapid
progress
that
she
soon
lost
all
sense
of
disadvantage
and
conducted
herself
behind
the
counter
very
much
as
if
she
were
back
in
her
old
store
in
polotzk
it
was
far
more
cosey
than
polotzk
at
least
so
it
seemed
to
me
for
behind
the
store
was
the
kitchen
where
in
the
intervals
of
slack
trade
she
did
her
cooking
and
washing
arlington
street
customers
were
used
to
waiting
while
the
storekeeper
salted
the
soup
or
rescued
a
loaf
from
the
oven
once
more
fortune
favored
my
family
with
a
thin
little
smile
and
my
father
in
reply
to
a
friendly
inquiry
would
say
one
makes
a
living
with
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
that
added
but
nothing
to
boast
of
it
was
characteristic
of
my
attitude
toward
matters
that
this
contented
me
and
i
felt
free
to
devote
myself
to
the
conquest
of
my
new
world
looking
back
to
those
critical
first
years
i
see
myself
always
behaving
like
a
child
let
loose
in
a
garden
to
play
and
dig
and
chase
the
butterflies
occasionally
indeed
i
was
stung
by
the
wasp
of
family
trouble
but
i
knew
a
healing
ointment
my
faith
in
america
my
father
had
come
to
america
to
make
a
living
america
which
was
free
and
fair
and
kind
must
presently
yield
him
what
he
sought
i
had
come
to
america
to
see
a
new
world
and
i
followed
my
own
ends
with
the
utmost
assiduity
only
as
i
ran
out
to
explore
i
would
look
back
to
see
if
my
house
were
in
order
behind
me
if
my
family
still
kept
its
head
above
water
in
after
years
when
i
passed
as
an
american
among
americans
if
i
was
suddenly
made
aware
of
the
past
that
lay
forgotten
if
a
letter
from
russia
or
a
paragraph
in
the
newspaper
or
a
conversation
overheard
in
the
suddenly
reminded
me
of
what
i
might
have
been
i
thought
it
miracle
enough
that
i
mashke
the
granddaughter
of
raphael
the
russian
born
to
a
humble
destiny
should
be
at
home
in
an
american
metropolis
be
free
to
fashion
my
own
life
and
should
dream
my
dreams
in
english
phrases
but
in
the
beginning
my
admiration
was
spent
on
more
concrete
embodiments
of
the
splendors
of
america
such
as
fine
houses
gay
shops
electric
engines
and
apparatus
public
buildings
illuminations
and
parades
my
early
letters
to
my
russian
friends
were
filled
with
boastful
descriptions
of
these
glories
of
my
new
country
no
native
citizen
of
chelsea
took
such
pride
and
delight
in
its
institutions
as
i
did
it
required
no
fife
and
drum
corps
no
fourth
of
july
procession
to
set
me
tingling
with
patriotism
even
the
common
agents
and
instruments
of
municipal
life
such
as
the
letter
carrier
and
the
fire
engine
i
regarded
with
a
measure
of
respect
i
know
what
i
thought
of
people
who
said
that
chelsea
was
a
very
small
dull
unaspiring
town
with
no
discernible
excuse
for
a
separate
name
or
existence
the
apex
of
my
civic
pride
and
personal
contentment
was
reached
on
the
bright
september
morning
when
i
entered
the
public
school
that
day
i
must
always
remember
even
if
i
live
to
be
so
old
that
i
can
not
tell
my
name
to
most
people
their
first
day
at
school
is
a
memorable
occasion
in
my
case
the
importance
of
the
day
was
a
hundred
times
magnified
on
account
of
the
years
i
had
waited
the
road
i
had
come
and
the
conscious
ambitions
i
entertained
i
am
wearily
aware
that
i
am
speaking
in
extreme
figures
in
superlatives
i
wish
i
knew
some
other
way
to
render
the
mental
life
of
the
immigrant
child
of
reasoning
age
i
may
have
been
ever
so
much
an
exception
in
acuteness
of
observation
powers
of
comparison
and
abnormal
none
the
less
were
my
thoughts
and
conduct
typical
of
the
attitude
of
the
intelligent
immigrant
child
toward
american
institutions
and
what
the
child
thinks
and
feels
is
a
reflection
of
the
hopes
desires
and
purposes
of
the
parents
who
brought
him
overseas
no
matter
how
precocious
and
independent
the
child
may
be
your
immigrant
inspectors
will
tell
you
what
poverty
the
foreigner
brings
in
his
baggage
what
want
in
his
pockets
let
the
overgrown
boy
of
twelve
reverently
drawing
his
letters
in
the
baby
class
testify
to
the
noble
dreams
and
high
ideals
that
may
be
hidden
beneath
the
greasy
caftan
of
the
immigrant
speaking
for
the
jews
at
least
i
know
i
am
safe
in
inviting
such
an
investigation
who
were
my
companions
on
my
first
day
at
school
whose
hand
was
in
mine
as
i
stood
overcome
with
awe
by
the
teacher
desk
and
whispered
my
name
as
my
father
prompted
was
it
frieda
steady
capable
hand
was
it
her
loyal
heart
that
throbbed
beat
for
beat
with
mine
as
it
had
done
through
all
our
childish
adventures
heart
did
throb
that
day
but
not
with
my
emotions
my
heart
pulsed
with
joy
and
pride
and
ambition
in
her
heart
longing
fought
with
abnegation
for
i
was
led
to
the
schoolroom
with
its
sunshine
and
its
singing
and
the
teacher
cheery
smile
while
she
was
led
to
the
workshop
with
its
foul
air
faces
and
the
foreman
stern
command
our
going
to
school
was
the
fulfilment
of
my
father
best
promises
to
us
and
frieda
share
in
it
was
to
fashion
and
fit
the
calico
frocks
in
which
the
baby
sister
and
i
made
our
first
appearance
in
a
public
schoolroom
i
remember
to
this
day
the
gray
pattern
of
the
calico
so
affectionately
did
i
regard
it
as
it
hung
upon
the
wall
my
consecration
robe
awaiting
the
beatific
day
and
frieda
i
am
sure
remembers
it
too
so
longingly
did
she
regard
it
as
the
crisp
starchy
breadths
of
it
slid
between
her
fingers
but
whatever
were
her
longings
she
said
nothing
of
them
she
bent
over
the
humming
an
melody
in
every
straight
smooth
seam
perhaps
she
tucked
away
some
lingering
impulse
of
childhood
but
she
matched
the
scrolls
and
flowers
with
the
utmost
care
if
a
sudden
shock
of
rebellion
made
her
straighten
up
for
an
instant
the
next
instant
she
was
bending
to
adjust
a
ruffle
to
the
best
advantage
and
when
the
momentous
day
arrived
and
the
little
sister
and
i
stood
up
to
be
arrayed
it
was
frieda
herself
who
patted
and
smoothed
my
stiff
new
calico
who
made
me
turn
round
and
round
to
see
that
i
was
perfect
who
stooped
to
pull
out
a
disfiguring
if
there
was
anything
in
her
heart
besides
sisterly
love
and
pride
and
as
we
parted
that
morning
it
was
a
sense
of
loss
and
a
acquiescence
in
her
fate
for
we
had
been
close
friends
and
now
our
ways
would
lie
apart
longing
she
felt
but
no
envy
she
did
not
grudge
me
what
she
was
denied
until
that
morning
we
had
been
children
together
but
now
at
the
fiat
of
her
destiny
she
became
a
woman
with
all
a
woman
cares
whilst
i
so
little
younger
than
she
was
bidden
to
dance
at
the
may
festival
of
untroubled
childhood
i
wish
for
my
comfort
that
i
could
say
that
i
had
some
notion
of
the
difference
in
our
lots
some
sense
of
the
injustice
to
her
of
the
indulgence
to
me
i
wish
i
could
even
say
that
i
gave
serious
thought
to
the
matter
there
had
always
been
a
distinction
between
us
rather
out
of
proportion
to
the
difference
in
our
years
her
good
health
and
domestic
instincts
had
made
it
natural
for
her
to
become
my
right
hand
in
the
years
preceding
the
emigration
when
there
were
no
more
servants
or
dependents
then
there
was
the
family
tradition
that
mary
was
the
quicker
the
brighter
of
the
two
and
that
hers
could
be
no
common
lot
frieda
was
relied
upon
for
help
and
her
sister
for
glory
and
when
i
failed
as
a
milliner
apprentice
while
frieda
made
excellent
progress
at
the
dressmaker
our
fates
indeed
were
sealed
it
was
understood
even
before
we
reached
boston
that
she
would
go
to
work
and
i
to
school
in
view
of
the
family
prejudices
it
was
the
inevitable
course
no
injustice
was
intended
my
father
sent
us
hand
in
hand
to
school
before
he
had
ever
thought
of
america
if
in
america
he
had
been
able
to
support
his
family
unaided
it
would
have
been
the
culmination
of
his
best
hopes
to
see
all
his
children
at
school
with
equal
advantages
at
home
but
when
he
had
done
his
best
and
was
still
unable
to
provide
even
bread
and
shelter
for
us
all
he
was
compelled
to
make
us
children
as
fast
as
it
was
practicable
there
was
no
choosing
possible
frieda
was
the
oldest
the
strongest
the
best
prepared
and
the
only
one
who
was
of
legal
age
to
be
put
to
work
my
father
has
nothing
to
answer
for
he
divided
the
world
between
his
children
in
accordance
with
the
laws
of
the
country
and
the
compulsion
of
his
circumstances
i
have
no
need
of
defending
him
it
is
myself
that
i
would
like
to
defend
and
i
can
not
i
remember
that
i
accepted
the
arrangements
made
for
my
sister
and
me
without
much
reflection
and
everything
that
was
planned
for
my
advantage
i
took
as
a
matter
of
course
i
was
no
heartless
monster
but
a
decidedly
child
if
my
sister
had
seemed
unhappy
it
would
have
troubled
me
but
i
am
ashamed
to
recall
that
i
did
not
consider
how
little
it
was
that
contented
her
i
was
so
preoccupied
with
my
own
happiness
that
i
did
not
half
perceive
the
splendid
devotion
of
her
attitude
towards
me
the
sweetness
of
her
joy
in
my
good
luck
she
not
only
stood
by
approvingly
when
i
was
helped
to
everything
she
cheerfully
waited
on
me
herself
and
i
took
everything
from
her
hand
as
if
it
were
my
due
the
two
of
us
stood
a
moment
in
the
doorway
of
the
tenement
house
on
arlington
street
that
wonderful
september
morning
when
i
first
went
to
school
it
was
i
that
ran
away
on
winged
feet
of
joy
and
expectation
it
was
she
whose
feet
were
bound
in
the
treadmill
of
daily
toil
and
i
was
so
blind
that
i
did
not
see
that
the
glory
lay
on
her
and
not
on
me
father
himself
conducted
us
to
school
he
would
not
have
delegated
that
mission
to
the
president
of
the
united
states
he
had
awaited
the
day
with
impatience
equal
to
mine
and
the
visions
he
saw
as
he
hurried
us
over
the
pavements
transcended
all
my
dreams
almost
his
first
act
on
landing
on
american
soil
three
years
before
had
been
his
application
for
naturalization
he
had
taken
the
remaining
steps
in
the
process
with
eager
promptness
and
at
the
earliest
moment
allowed
by
the
law
he
became
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
it
is
true
that
he
had
left
home
in
search
of
bread
for
his
hungry
family
but
he
went
blessing
the
necessity
that
drove
him
to
america
the
boasted
freedom
of
the
new
world
meant
to
him
far
more
than
the
right
to
reside
travel
and
work
wherever
he
pleased
it
meant
the
freedom
to
speak
his
thoughts
to
throw
off
the
shackles
of
superstition
to
test
his
own
fate
unhindered
by
political
or
religious
tyranny
he
was
only
a
young
man
when
he
landed
and
most
of
his
life
he
had
been
held
in
he
was
hungry
for
his
untasted
manhood
three
years
passed
in
sordid
struggle
and
disappointment
he
was
not
prepared
to
make
a
living
even
in
america
where
the
day
laborer
eats
wheat
instead
of
rye
apparently
the
american
flag
could
not
protect
him
against
the
pursuing
nemesis
of
his
limitations
he
must
expiate
the
sins
of
his
fathers
who
slept
across
the
seas
he
had
been
endowed
at
birth
with
a
poor
constitution
a
nervous
restless
temperament
and
an
abundance
of
hindering
prejudices
in
his
boyhood
his
body
was
starved
that
his
mind
might
be
stuffed
with
useless
learning
in
his
youth
this
dearly
gotten
learning
was
sold
and
the
price
was
the
bread
and
salt
which
he
had
not
been
trained
to
earn
for
himself
under
the
wedding
canopy
he
was
bound
for
life
to
a
girl
whose
features
were
still
strange
to
him
and
he
was
bidden
to
multiply
himself
that
sacred
learning
might
be
perpetuated
in
his
sons
to
the
glory
of
the
god
of
his
fathers
all
this
while
he
had
been
led
about
as
a
creature
without
a
will
a
chattel
an
instrument
in
his
maturity
he
awoke
and
found
himself
poor
in
health
poor
in
purse
poor
in
useful
knowledge
and
hampered
on
all
sides
at
the
first
nod
of
opportunity
he
broke
away
from
his
prison
and
strove
to
atone
for
his
wasted
youth
by
a
life
of
useful
labor
while
at
the
same
time
he
sought
to
lighten
the
gloom
of
his
narrow
scholarship
by
freely
partaking
of
modern
ideas
but
his
utmost
endeavor
still
left
him
far
from
his
goal
in
business
nothing
prospered
with
him
some
fault
of
hand
or
mind
or
temperament
led
him
to
failure
where
other
men
found
success
wherever
the
blame
for
his
disabilities
be
placed
he
reaped
their
bitter
fruit
give
me
bread
he
cried
to
america
what
will
you
do
to
earn
it
the
challenge
came
back
and
he
found
that
he
was
master
of
no
art
of
no
trade
that
even
his
precious
learning
was
of
no
avail
because
he
had
only
the
most
antiquated
methods
of
communicating
it
so
in
his
primary
quest
he
had
failed
there
was
left
him
the
compensation
of
intellectual
freedom
that
he
sought
to
realize
in
every
possible
way
he
had
very
little
opportunity
to
prosecute
his
education
which
in
truth
had
never
been
begun
his
struggle
for
a
bare
living
left
him
no
time
to
take
advantage
of
the
public
evening
school
but
he
lost
nothing
of
what
was
to
be
learned
through
reading
through
attendance
at
public
meetings
through
exercising
the
rights
of
citizenship
even
here
he
was
hindered
by
a
natural
inability
to
acquire
the
english
language
in
time
indeed
he
learned
to
read
to
follow
a
conversation
or
lecture
but
he
never
learned
to
write
correctly
and
his
pronunciation
remains
extremely
foreign
to
this
day
if
education
culture
the
higher
life
were
shining
things
to
be
worshipped
from
afar
he
had
still
a
means
left
whereby
he
could
draw
one
step
nearer
to
them
he
could
send
his
children
to
school
to
learn
all
those
things
that
he
knew
by
fame
to
be
desirable
the
common
school
at
least
perhaps
high
school
for
one
or
two
perhaps
even
college
his
children
should
be
students
should
fill
his
house
with
books
and
intellectual
company
and
thus
he
would
walk
by
proxy
in
the
elysian
fields
of
liberal
learning
as
for
the
children
themselves
he
knew
no
surer
way
to
their
advancement
and
happiness
so
it
was
with
a
heart
full
of
longing
and
hope
that
my
father
led
us
to
school
on
that
first
day
he
took
long
strides
in
his
eagerness
the
rest
of
us
running
and
hopping
to
keep
up
at
last
the
four
of
us
stood
around
the
teacher
desk
and
my
father
in
his
impossible
english
gave
us
over
in
her
charge
with
some
broken
word
of
his
hopes
for
us
that
his
swelling
heart
could
no
longer
contain
i
venture
to
say
that
miss
nixon
was
struck
by
something
uncommon
in
the
group
we
made
something
outside
of
semitic
features
and
the
abashed
manner
of
the
alien
my
little
sister
was
as
pretty
as
a
doll
with
her
clear
face
short
golden
curls
and
eyes
like
blue
violets
when
you
caught
them
looking
up
my
brother
might
have
been
a
girl
too
with
his
cherubic
contours
of
face
rich
red
color
glossy
black
hair
and
fine
eyebrows
whatever
secret
fears
were
in
his
heart
remembering
his
former
teachers
who
had
taught
with
the
rod
he
stood
up
straight
and
uncringing
before
the
american
teacher
his
cap
respectfully
doffed
next
to
him
stood
a
girl
with
eyes
ready
to
pop
out
and
short
dark
curls
that
would
not
have
made
much
of
a
wig
for
a
jewish
bride
all
three
children
carried
themselves
rather
better
than
the
common
run
of
green
pupils
that
were
brought
to
miss
nixon
but
the
figure
that
challenged
attention
to
the
group
was
the
tall
straight
father
with
his
earnest
face
and
fine
forehead
nervous
hands
eloquent
in
gesture
and
a
voice
full
of
feeling
this
foreigner
who
brought
his
children
to
school
as
if
it
were
an
act
of
consecration
who
regarded
the
teacher
of
the
primer
class
with
reverence
who
spoke
of
visions
like
a
man
inspired
in
a
common
schoolroom
was
not
like
other
aliens
who
brought
their
children
in
dull
obedience
to
the
law
was
not
like
the
native
fathers
who
brought
their
unmanageable
boys
glad
to
be
relieved
of
their
care
i
think
miss
nixon
guessed
what
my
father
best
english
could
not
convey
i
think
she
divined
that
by
the
simple
act
of
delivering
our
school
certificates
to
her
he
took
possession
of
america
chapter
x
initiation
it
is
not
worth
while
to
refer
to
voluminous
school
statistics
to
see
just
how
many
green
pupils
entered
school
last
september
not
knowing
the
days
of
the
week
in
english
who
next
february
will
be
declaiming
patriotic
verses
in
honor
of
george
washington
and
abraham
lincoln
with
a
foreign
accent
indeed
but
with
plenty
of
enthusiasm
it
is
enough
to
know
that
this
miracle
is
common
to
the
schools
in
every
part
of
the
united
states
where
immigrants
are
received
and
if
i
was
one
of
chelsea
hundred
in
it
was
only
to
be
expected
since
i
was
one
of
the
older
of
the
green
children
and
had
had
a
start
in
my
irregular
schooling
in
russia
and
was
carried
along
by
a
tremendous
desire
to
learn
and
had
my
family
to
cheer
me
on
i
was
not
a
bit
too
large
for
my
little
chair
and
desk
in
the
baby
class
but
my
mind
of
course
was
too
mature
by
six
or
seven
years
for
the
work
so
as
soon
as
i
could
understand
what
the
teacher
said
in
class
i
was
advanced
to
the
second
grade
this
was
within
a
week
after
miss
nixon
took
me
in
hand
but
i
do
not
mean
to
give
my
dear
teacher
all
the
credit
for
my
rapid
progress
nor
even
half
the
credit
i
shall
divide
it
with
her
on
behalf
of
my
race
and
my
family
i
was
jew
enough
to
have
an
aptitude
for
language
in
general
and
to
bend
my
mind
earnestly
to
my
task
i
was
antin
enough
to
read
each
lesson
with
my
heart
which
gave
me
an
inkling
of
what
was
coming
next
and
so
carried
me
along
by
leaps
and
bounds
as
for
the
teacher
she
could
best
explain
what
theory
she
followed
in
teaching
us
foreigners
to
read
i
can
only
describe
the
method
which
was
so
simple
that
i
wish
holiness
could
be
taught
in
the
same
way
there
were
about
half
a
dozen
of
us
beginners
in
english
in
age
from
six
to
fifteen
miss
nixon
made
a
special
class
of
us
and
aided
us
so
skilfully
and
earnestly
in
our
endeavors
to
and
and
that
we
turned
over
page
after
page
of
the
ravishing
history
eager
to
find
out
how
the
common
world
looked
smelled
and
tasted
in
the
strange
speech
the
teacher
knew
just
when
to
let
us
help
each
other
out
with
a
word
in
our
own
tongue
it
happened
that
we
were
all
jews
and
so
working
all
together
we
actually
covered
more
ground
in
a
lesson
than
the
native
classes
composed
entirely
of
the
little
tots
but
we
stuck
stuck
fast
at
the
definite
article
and
sometimes
the
lesson
resolved
itself
into
a
species
of
lingual
gymnastics
in
which
we
all
looked
as
if
we
meant
to
bite
our
tongues
off
miss
nixon
was
pretty
and
she
must
have
looked
well
with
her
white
teeth
showing
in
the
act
but
at
the
time
i
was
too
solemnly
occupied
to
admire
her
looks
i
did
take
great
pleasure
in
her
smile
of
approval
whenever
i
pronounced
well
and
her
patience
and
perseverance
in
struggling
with
us
over
that
thick
little
word
are
becoming
to
her
even
now
after
fifteen
years
it
is
not
her
fault
if
any
of
us
give
a
buzzing
sound
to
the
dreadful
english
i
shall
never
have
a
better
opportunity
to
make
public
declaration
of
my
love
for
the
english
language
i
am
glad
that
american
history
runs
chapter
for
chapter
the
way
it
does
for
thus
america
came
to
be
the
country
i
love
so
dearly
i
am
glad
most
of
all
that
the
americans
began
by
being
englishmen
for
thus
did
i
come
to
inherit
this
beautiful
language
in
which
i
think
it
seems
to
me
that
in
any
other
language
happiness
is
not
so
sweet
logic
is
not
so
clear
i
am
not
sure
that
i
could
believe
in
my
neighbors
as
i
do
if
i
thought
about
them
in
words
i
could
almost
say
that
my
conviction
of
immortality
is
bound
up
with
the
english
of
its
promise
and
as
i
am
attached
to
my
prejudices
i
must
love
the
english
language
whenever
the
teachers
did
anything
special
to
help
me
over
my
private
difficulties
my
gratitude
went
out
to
them
silently
it
meant
so
much
to
me
that
they
halted
the
lesson
to
give
me
a
lift
that
i
needs
must
love
them
for
it
dear
miss
carrol
of
the
second
grade
would
be
amazed
to
hear
what
small
things
i
remember
all
because
i
was
so
impressed
at
the
time
with
her
readiness
and
sweetness
in
taking
notice
of
my
difficulties
says
miss
carrol
looking
straight
at
me
if
johnnie
has
three
marbles
and
charlie
has
twice
as
many
how
many
marbles
has
charlie
i
raise
my
hand
for
permission
to
speak
teacher
i
do
know
vhat
is
tvice
teacher
beckons
me
to
her
and
whispers
to
me
the
meaning
of
the
strange
word
and
i
am
able
to
write
the
sum
correctly
it
all
in
the
day
work
with
her
with
me
it
is
a
special
act
of
kindness
and
efficiency
she
whom
i
found
in
the
next
grade
became
so
dear
a
friend
that
i
can
hardly
name
her
with
the
rest
though
i
mention
none
of
them
lightly
her
approval
was
always
dear
to
me
first
because
she
was
teacher
and
afterwards
as
long
as
she
lived
because
she
was
my
miss
dillingham
great
was
my
grief
therefore
when
shortly
after
my
admission
to
her
class
i
incurred
discipline
the
first
and
next
to
the
last
time
in
my
school
career
the
class
was
repeating
in
chorus
the
lord
prayer
heads
bowed
on
desks
i
was
doing
my
best
to
keep
up
by
the
sound
my
mind
could
not
go
beyond
the
word
hallowed
for
which
i
had
not
found
the
meaning
in
the
middle
of
the
prayer
a
jewish
boy
across
the
aisle
trod
on
my
foot
to
get
my
attention
you
must
not
say
that
he
admonished
in
a
solemn
whisper
it
christian
i
whispered
back
that
it
was
and
went
on
to
the
amen
i
did
not
know
but
what
he
was
right
but
the
name
of
christ
was
not
in
the
prayer
and
i
was
bound
to
do
everything
that
the
class
did
if
i
had
any
jewish
scruples
they
were
lagging
away
behind
my
interest
in
school
affairs
how
american
this
was
two
pupils
side
by
side
in
the
schoolroom
each
holding
to
his
own
opinion
but
both
submitting
to
the
common
law
for
the
boy
at
least
bowed
his
head
as
the
teacher
ordered
but
all
miss
dillingham
knew
of
it
was
that
two
of
her
pupils
whispered
during
morning
prayer
and
she
must
discipline
them
so
i
was
degraded
from
the
honor
row
to
the
lowest
row
and
it
was
many
a
day
before
i
forgave
that
young
missionary
it
was
not
enough
for
my
vengeance
that
he
suffered
punishment
with
me
teacher
of
course
heard
us
both
defend
ourselves
but
there
was
a
time
and
a
place
for
religious
arguments
and
she
meant
to
help
us
remember
that
point
i
remember
to
this
day
what
a
struggle
we
had
over
the
word
water
miss
dillingham
and
i
it
seemed
as
if
i
could
not
give
the
sound
of
i
said
vater
every
time
patiently
my
teacher
worked
with
me
inventing
mouth
exercises
for
me
to
get
my
stubborn
lips
to
produce
that
and
when
at
last
i
could
say
village
and
water
in
rapid
alternation
without
misplacing
the
two
initials
that
memorable
word
was
sweet
on
my
lips
for
we
had
conquered
and
teacher
was
pleased
getting
a
language
in
this
way
word
by
word
has
a
charm
that
may
be
set
against
the
disadvantages
it
is
like
gathering
a
posy
blossom
by
blossom
bring
the
bouquet
into
your
chamber
and
these
nasturtiums
stand
for
the
whole
flaming
carnival
of
them
tumbling
over
the
fence
out
there
these
yellow
pansies
recall
the
velvet
crescent
of
color
glowing
under
the
bay
window
this
spray
of
honeysuckle
smells
like
the
masses
of
it
on
the
porch
ripe
and
the
whole
garden
in
a
glass
tumbler
so
it
is
with
one
who
gathers
words
loving
them
particular
words
remain
associated
with
important
occasions
in
the
learner
mind
i
could
thus
write
a
history
of
my
english
vocabulary
that
should
be
at
the
same
time
an
account
of
my
comings
and
goings
my
mistakes
and
my
triumphs
during
the
years
of
my
initiation
if
i
was
eager
and
diligent
my
teachers
did
not
sleep
as
fast
as
my
knowledge
of
english
allowed
they
advanced
me
from
grade
to
grade
without
reference
to
the
usual
schedule
of
promotions
my
father
was
right
when
he
often
said
in
discussing
my
prospects
that
ability
would
be
promptly
recognized
in
the
public
schools
rapid
as
was
my
progress
on
account
of
the
advantages
with
which
i
started
some
of
the
other
green
pupils
were
not
far
behind
me
within
a
grade
or
two
by
the
end
of
the
year
my
brother
whose
childhood
had
been
one
hideous
nightmare
what
with
the
stupid
rebbe
the
cruel
whip
and
the
general
repression
of
life
in
the
pale
surprised
my
father
by
the
progress
he
made
under
intelligent
sympathetic
guidance
indeed
he
soon
had
a
reputation
in
the
school
that
the
american
boys
envied
and
all
through
the
school
course
he
more
than
held
his
own
with
pupils
of
his
age
so
much
for
the
right
and
wrong
way
of
doing
things
there
is
a
record
of
my
early
progress
in
english
much
better
than
my
recollections
however
accurate
and
definite
these
may
be
i
have
several
reasons
for
introducing
it
here
first
it
shows
what
the
russian
jew
can
do
with
an
adopted
language
next
it
proves
that
vigilance
of
our
teachers
of
which
i
spoke
and
last
i
am
proud
of
it
that
is
an
unnecessary
confession
but
i
could
not
be
satisfied
to
insert
the
record
here
with
my
vanity
unavowed
this
is
the
document
copied
from
an
educational
journal
a
tattered
copy
of
which
lies
in
my
lap
as
i
write
treasured
for
fifteen
years
you
see
by
my
vanity
editor
primary
education
this
is
the
uncorrected
paper
of
a
russian
child
twelve
years
old
who
had
studied
english
only
four
months
she
had
never
until
september
been
to
school
even
in
her
own
country
and
has
heard
english
spoken
at
school
i
shall
be
glad
if
the
paper
of
my
pupil
and
the
above
explanation
may
appear
in
your
paper
dillingham
chelsea
mass
snow
snow
is
frozen
moisture
which
comes
from
the
clouds
now
the
snow
is
coming
down
in
which
makes
nice
but
there
is
still
one
kind
of
snow
more
this
kind
of
snow
is
called
for
it
comes
down
in
little
curly
balls
these
are
quiet
as
good
for
as
for
they
the
are
dry
so
they
ca
keep
together
as
do
the
snow
is
dear
to
some
children
for
they
like
sleighing
as
i
said
at
the
top
the
snow
comes
from
the
clouds
now
the
trees
are
bare
and
no
flowers
are
to
see
in
the
fields
and
gardens
we
all
know
why
and
the
whole
world
seems
like
asleep
without
the
happy
birds
songs
which
left
us
till
spring
but
the
snow
which
drove
away
all
these
pretty
and
happy
things
try
as
i
think
not
to
make
us
at
all
unhappy
they
covered
up
the
branches
of
the
trees
the
fields
the
gardens
and
houses
and
the
whole
world
looks
like
dressed
in
a
beautiful
white
instead
of
green
dress
with
the
sky
looking
down
on
it
with
a
pale
face
and
so
the
people
can
find
some
joy
in
it
too
without
the
happy
summer
mary
antin
and
now
that
it
stands
there
with
name
over
it
i
am
ashamed
of
my
flippant
talk
about
vanity
more
to
me
than
all
the
praise
i
could
hope
to
win
by
the
conquest
of
fifty
languages
is
the
association
of
this
dear
friend
with
my
earliest
efforts
at
writing
and
it
pleases
me
to
remember
that
to
her
i
owe
my
very
first
appearance
in
print
vanity
is
the
least
part
of
it
when
i
remember
how
she
called
me
to
her
desk
one
day
after
school
was
out
and
showed
me
my
composition
my
own
words
that
i
had
written
out
of
my
own
head
printed
out
clear
black
and
white
with
my
name
at
the
end
nothing
so
wonderful
had
ever
happened
to
me
before
my
whole
consciousness
was
suddenly
transformed
i
suppose
that
was
the
moment
when
i
became
a
writer
i
always
loved
to
write
i
wrote
letters
whenever
i
had
an
excuse
yet
it
had
never
occurred
to
me
to
sit
down
and
write
my
thoughts
for
no
person
in
particular
merely
to
put
the
word
on
paper
but
now
as
i
read
my
own
words
in
a
delicious
confusion
the
idea
was
born
i
stared
at
my
name
mary
antin
was
that
really
i
the
printed
characters
composing
it
seemed
strange
to
me
all
of
a
sudden
if
that
was
my
name
and
those
were
the
words
out
of
my
own
head
what
relation
did
it
all
have
to
who
was
alone
there
with
miss
dillingham
and
the
printed
page
between
us
why
it
meant
that
i
could
write
again
and
see
my
writing
printed
for
people
to
read
i
could
write
many
many
many
things
i
could
write
a
book
the
idea
was
so
huge
so
bewildering
that
my
mind
scarcely
could
accommodate
it
i
do
not
know
what
my
teacher
said
to
me
probably
very
little
it
was
her
way
to
say
only
a
little
and
look
at
me
and
trust
me
to
understand
once
she
had
occasion
to
lecture
me
about
living
a
life
she
wanted
me
to
go
outdoors
i
had
been
repeatedly
scolded
and
reproved
on
that
score
by
other
people
but
i
had
only
laughed
saying
that
i
was
too
happy
to
change
my
ways
but
when
miss
dillingham
spoke
to
me
i
saw
that
it
was
a
serious
matter
and
yet
she
only
said
a
few
words
and
looked
at
me
with
that
smile
of
hers
that
was
only
half
a
smile
and
the
rest
a
meaning
another
time
she
had
a
great
question
to
ask
me
touching
my
life
to
the
quick
she
merely
put
her
question
and
was
silent
but
i
knew
what
answer
she
expected
and
not
being
able
to
give
it
then
i
went
away
sad
and
reproved
years
later
i
had
my
triumphant
answer
but
she
was
no
longer
there
to
receive
it
and
so
her
eyes
look
at
me
from
the
picture
on
the
mantel
there
with
a
reproach
i
no
longer
merit
i
ought
to
go
back
and
strike
out
all
that
talk
about
vanity
what
reason
have
i
to
be
vain
when
i
reflect
how
at
every
step
i
was
petted
nursed
and
encouraged
i
did
not
even
discover
my
own
talent
it
was
discovered
first
by
my
father
in
russia
and
next
by
my
friend
in
america
what
did
i
ever
do
but
write
when
they
told
me
to
write
i
suppose
my
grandfather
who
drove
a
spavined
horse
through
lonely
country
lanes
sat
in
the
shade
of
oaks
to
refresh
himself
with
a
bit
of
black
bread
and
an
acorn
falling
beside
him
in
the
immense
stillness
shook
his
heart
with
the
echo
and
left
him
wondering
i
suppose
my
father
stole
away
from
the
synagogue
one
long
festival
day
and
stretched
himself
out
in
the
grass
and
lost
himself
in
dreams
that
made
the
world
of
men
unreal
when
he
returned
to
them
and
so
what
is
there
left
for
me
to
do
who
do
not
have
to
drive
a
horse
nor
interpret
ancient
lore
but
put
my
grandfather
question
into
words
and
set
to
music
my
father
dream
the
tongue
am
i
of
those
who
lived
before
me
as
those
that
are
to
come
will
be
the
voice
of
my
unspoken
thoughts
and
so
who
shall
be
applauded
if
the
song
be
sweet
if
the
prophecy
be
true
i
never
heard
of
any
one
who
was
so
watched
and
coaxed
so
passed
along
from
hand
to
helping
hand
as
was
i
always
had
friends
they
sprang
up
everywhere
as
if
they
had
stood
waiting
for
me
to
come
so
here
was
my
teacher
the
moment
she
saw
that
i
could
give
a
good
paraphrase
of
her
talk
on
snow
bent
on
finding
out
what
more
i
could
do
one
day
she
asked
me
if
i
had
ever
written
poetry
i
had
not
but
i
went
home
and
tried
i
believe
it
was
more
snow
and
i
know
it
was
wretched
i
wish
i
could
produce
a
copy
of
that
early
effusion
it
would
prove
that
my
judgment
is
not
severe
wretched
it
was
worse
a
great
deal
than
reams
of
poetry
that
is
written
by
children
about
whom
there
is
no
fuss
made
but
miss
dillingham
was
not
discouraged
she
saw
that
i
had
no
idea
of
metre
so
she
proceeded
to
teach
me
we
repeated
miles
of
poetry
together
smooth
lines
that
sang
themselves
mostly
out
of
longfellow
then
i
would
go
home
and
write
oh
about
the
snow
in
our
back
yard
but
when
miss
dillingham
came
to
read
my
verses
they
limped
and
they
lagged
and
they
dragged
and
there
was
no
tune
that
would
fit
them
at
last
came
the
moment
of
illumination
i
saw
where
my
trouble
lay
i
had
supposed
that
my
lines
matched
when
they
had
an
equal
number
of
syllables
taking
no
account
of
accent
now
i
knew
better
now
i
could
write
poetry
the
everlasting
snow
melted
at
last
and
the
mud
puddles
dried
in
the
spring
sun
and
the
grass
on
the
common
was
green
and
still
i
wrote
poetry
again
i
wish
i
had
some
example
of
my
springtime
rhapsodies
the
veriest
rubbish
of
the
sort
that
ever
a
child
perpetrated
lizzie
mcdee
who
had
red
hair
and
freckles
and
a
manner
on
weekdays
and
was
below
me
in
the
class
did
a
great
deal
better
we
used
to
compare
verses
and
while
i
do
not
remember
that
i
ever
had
the
grace
to
own
that
she
was
the
better
poet
i
do
know
that
i
secretly
wondered
why
the
teachers
did
not
invite
her
to
stay
after
school
and
study
poetry
while
they
took
so
much
pains
with
me
but
so
it
was
always
with
me
somebody
did
something
for
me
all
the
time
making
fair
allowance
for
my
youth
retarded
education
and
strangeness
to
the
language
it
must
still
be
admitted
that
i
never
wrote
good
verse
but
i
loved
to
read
it
my
with
miss
dillingham
were
full
of
delight
for
me
quite
apart
from
my
ambition
to
become
a
writer
what
then
was
my
joy
when
miss
dillingham
just
before
locking
up
her
desk
one
evening
presented
me
with
a
volume
of
longfellow
poems
it
was
a
thin
volume
of
selections
but
to
me
it
was
a
bottomless
treasure
i
had
never
owned
a
book
before
the
sense
of
possession
alone
was
a
source
of
bliss
and
this
book
i
already
knew
and
loved
and
so
miss
dillingham
who
was
my
first
american
friend
and
who
first
put
my
name
in
print
was
also
the
one
to
start
my
library
deep
is
my
regret
when
i
consider
that
she
was
gone
before
i
had
given
much
of
an
account
of
all
her
gifts
of
love
and
service
to
me
about
the
middle
of
the
year
i
was
promoted
to
the
grammar
school
then
it
was
that
i
walked
on
air
for
i
said
to
myself
that
i
was
a
now
in
earnest
not
merely
a
learning
to
spell
and
cipher
i
was
going
to
learn
things
things
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
ordinary
life
things
to
when
i
walked
home
afternoons
with
the
great
big
geography
book
under
my
arm
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
earth
was
conscious
of
my
step
sometimes
i
carried
home
half
the
books
in
my
desk
not
because
i
should
need
them
but
because
i
loved
to
hold
them
and
also
because
i
loved
to
be
seen
carrying
books
it
was
a
badge
of
scholarship
and
i
was
proud
of
it
i
remembered
the
days
in
vitebsk
when
i
used
to
watch
my
cousin
hirshel
start
for
school
in
the
morning
every
thread
of
his
uniform
every
worn
copybook
in
his
satchel
glorified
in
my
envious
eyes
and
now
i
was
myself
as
he
aye
greater
than
he
for
i
knew
english
and
i
could
write
poetry
if
my
head
was
not
turned
at
this
time
it
was
because
i
was
so
busy
from
morning
till
night
my
father
did
his
best
to
make
me
vain
and
silly
he
made
much
of
me
to
every
chance
caller
boasting
of
my
progress
at
school
and
of
my
exalted
friends
the
teachers
for
a
was
no
ordinary
mortal
in
his
eyes
she
was
a
superior
being
set
above
the
common
run
of
men
by
her
erudition
and
devotion
to
higher
things
that
a
could
be
shallow
or
petty
or
greedy
for
pay
was
a
thing
that
he
could
not
have
been
brought
to
believe
at
this
time
and
he
was
right
if
he
could
only
have
stuck
to
it
in
later
years
when
a
pessimism
fathered
by
his
perception
that
in
america
too
some
things
needed
mending
threw
him
to
the
opposite
extreme
of
opinion
crying
that
nothing
in
the
american
scheme
of
society
or
government
was
worth
tinkering
he
surely
was
right
in
his
first
appraisal
of
the
teacher
the
mean
sort
of
teachers
are
not
teachers
at
all
they
are
who
take
up
teaching
as
a
business
to
support
themselves
and
keep
their
hands
white
these
same
persons
did
they
keep
store
or
drive
a
milk
wagon
or
wash
babies
for
a
living
would
be
respectable
as
trespassers
on
a
noble
profession
they
are
worth
no
more
than
the
books
and
slates
and
desks
over
which
they
preside
so
much
furniture
to
be
had
by
the
gross
they
do
not
love
their
work
they
contribute
nothing
to
the
higher
development
of
their
pupils
they
busy
themselves
not
with
research
into
the
science
of
teaching
but
with
organizing
political
demonstrations
to
advance
the
cause
of
selfish
candidates
for
public
office
who
promise
them
rewards
the
true
teachers
are
of
another
strain
apostles
all
of
an
ideal
they
go
to
their
work
in
a
spirit
of
love
and
inquiry
seeking
not
comfort
not
position
not
pensions
but
truth
that
is
the
soul
of
wisdom
the
joy
of
children
the
food
of
hungry
youth
they
were
true
teachers
who
used
to
come
to
me
on
arlington
street
so
my
father
had
reason
to
boast
of
the
distinction
brought
upon
his
house
for
the
in
her
trim
unostentatious
dress
was
an
uncommon
visitor
in
our
neighborhood
and
the
talk
that
passed
in
the
bare
little
parlor
over
the
grocery
store
would
not
have
been
entirely
comprehensible
to
our
neighbor
in
the
grammar
school
i
had
as
good
teaching
as
i
had
had
in
the
primary
it
seems
to
me
in
retrospect
that
it
was
as
good
on
the
whole
as
the
public
school
ideals
of
the
time
made
possible
when
i
recall
how
i
was
taught
geography
i
see
indeed
that
there
was
room
for
improvement
occasionally
both
in
the
substance
and
in
the
method
of
instruction
but
i
know
of
at
least
one
teacher
of
chelsea
who
realized
this
for
i
met
her
eight
years
later
at
a
great
metropolitan
university
that
holds
a
summer
session
for
the
benefit
of
who
want
to
keep
up
with
the
advance
in
their
science
very
likely
they
no
longer
teach
geography
entirely
within
doors
and
by
rote
as
i
was
taught
fifteen
years
is
plenty
of
time
for
progress
when
i
joined
the
first
grammar
grade
the
class
had
had
a
start
of
me
but
it
was
not
long
before
i
found
my
place
near
the
head
in
all
branches
except
geography
it
was
genuine
progress
i
overtook
the
youngsters
in
their
study
of
numbers
spelling
reading
and
composition
in
geography
i
merely
made
a
bluff
but
i
did
not
know
it
neither
did
my
teacher
i
came
up
to
such
tests
as
she
put
me
the
lesson
was
on
chelsea
which
was
right
geography
like
charity
should
begin
at
home
our
text
ran
on
for
a
paragraph
or
so
on
the
location
boundaries
natural
features
and
industries
of
the
town
with
a
bit
of
local
history
thrown
in
we
were
to
learn
all
these
interesting
facts
and
be
prepared
to
write
them
out
from
memory
the
next
day
i
went
home
and
learned
learned
every
word
of
the
text
every
comma
every
footnote
when
the
teacher
had
read
my
paper
she
marked
it
ee
e
was
for
excellent
but
my
paper
was
absolutely
perfect
and
must
be
put
in
a
class
by
itself
the
teacher
exhibited
my
paper
before
the
class
with
some
remarks
about
the
diligence
that
could
overtake
in
a
week
pupils
who
had
had
half
a
year
start
i
took
it
all
as
modestly
as
i
could
never
doubting
that
i
was
indeed
a
very
bright
little
girl
and
getting
to
be
very
learned
to
boot
i
was
perfect
in
geography
a
most
erudite
subject
but
what
was
the
truth
the
words
that
i
repeated
so
accurately
on
my
paper
had
about
as
much
meaning
to
me
as
the
words
of
the
psalms
i
used
to
chant
in
hebrew
i
got
an
idea
that
the
city
of
chelsea
and
the
world
in
general
was
laid
out
flat
like
the
common
and
shaved
off
at
the
ends
to
allow
the
north
south
east
and
west
to
snuggle
up
close
like
the
frame
around
a
picture
if
i
looked
at
the
map
i
was
utterly
bewildered
i
could
find
no
correspondence
between
the
picture
and
the
verbal
explanations
with
words
i
was
safe
i
could
learn
any
number
of
words
by
heart
and
sometime
or
other
they
would
pop
out
of
the
medley
clothed
with
meaning
chelsea
i
read
was
bounded
on
all
sides
bounded
appealed
to
my
imagination
by
various
things
that
i
had
never
identified
much
as
i
had
roamed
about
the
town
i
immediately
pictured
these
remote
boundaries
as
a
fence
in
a
good
state
of
preservation
with
the
mystic
river
the
towns
of
everett
and
revere
and
east
boston
creek
rejoicing
on
the
south
west
north
and
east
of
it
respectively
that
they
had
got
inside
while
the
rest
of
the
world
peeped
in
enviously
through
a
knot
hole
in
the
middle
of
this
cherished
area
piano
factories
or
was
it
shoe
factories
proudly
reared
their
chimneys
while
the
population
promenaded
on
a
saluted
at
every
turn
by
the
benevolent
inmates
of
the
soldiers
home
on
the
top
of
powderhorn
hill
perhaps
the
fault
was
partly
mine
because
i
always
would
reduce
everything
to
a
picture
partly
it
may
have
been
because
i
had
not
had
time
to
digest
the
general
definitions
and
explanations
at
the
beginning
of
the
book
still
i
can
take
but
little
of
the
blame
when
i
consider
how
i
fared
through
my
geography
right
to
the
end
of
the
course
i
did
in
time
disentangle
the
symbolism
of
the
orange
revolving
on
a
from
the
astronomical
facts
in
the
case
but
it
took
years
of
training
under
a
master
of
the
subject
to
rid
me
of
my
distrust
of
the
map
as
a
representation
of
the
earth
to
this
day
i
sometimes
blunder
back
to
my
early
impression
that
any
given
portion
of
the
earth
surface
is
constructed
upon
a
skeleton
consisting
of
two
crossed
bars
terminating
in
arrowheads
which
pin
the
cardinal
points
into
place
and
if
i
want
to
find
any
desired
point
of
the
compass
i
am
inclined
to
throw
myself
flat
on
my
nose
my
head
due
north
and
my
outstretched
arms
seeking
the
east
and
west
respectively
for
in
the
schoolroom
as
far
as
the
study
of
the
map
went
we
began
with
the
symbol
and
stuck
to
the
symbol
no
teacher
of
geography
i
ever
had
except
the
master
i
referred
to
took
the
pains
to
ascertain
whether
i
had
any
sense
of
the
facts
for
which
the
symbols
stood
outside
the
study
of
maps
geography
consisted
of
statistics
tables
of
population
imports
and
exports
manufactures
and
degrees
of
temperature
dimensions
of
rivers
mountains
and
political
states
with
lists
of
minerals
plants
and
plagues
native
to
any
given
part
of
the
globe
the
only
part
of
the
whole
subject
that
meant
anything
to
me
was
the
description
of
the
aspect
of
foreign
lands
and
the
manners
and
customs
of
their
peoples
the
relation
of
physiography
to
human
history
what
might
be
called
the
moral
of
geography
was
not
taught
at
all
or
was
touched
upon
in
an
unimpressive
manner
the
prevalence
of
this
defect
in
the
teaching
of
school
geography
is
borne
out
by
the
surprise
of
the
college
freshman
who
remarked
to
the
professor
of
geology
that
it
was
curious
to
note
how
all
the
big
rivers
and
harbors
on
the
atlantic
coastal
plain
occurred
in
the
neighborhood
of
large
cities
a
little
instruction
in
the
elements
of
chartography
a
little
practice
in
the
use
of
the
compass
and
the
spirit
level
a
topographical
map
of
the
town
common
an
excursion
with
a
road
map
would
have
given
me
a
fat
round
earth
in
place
of
my
paper
ghost
would
have
illumined
the
one
dark
alley
in
my
school
life
chapter
xi
my
country
the
public
school
has
done
its
best
for
us
foreigners
and
for
the
country
when
it
has
made
us
into
good
americans
i
am
glad
it
is
mine
to
tell
how
the
miracle
was
wrought
in
one
case
you
should
be
glad
to
hear
of
it
you
born
americans
for
it
is
the
story
of
the
growth
of
your
country
of
the
flocking
of
your
brothers
and
sisters
from
the
far
ends
of
the
earth
to
the
flag
you
love
of
the
recruiting
of
your
armies
of
workers
thinkers
and
leaders
and
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
of
it
my
comrades
in
adoption
for
it
is
a
rehearsal
of
your
own
experience
the
thrill
and
wonder
of
which
your
own
hearts
have
felt
how
long
would
you
say
wise
reader
it
takes
to
make
an
american
by
the
middle
of
my
second
year
in
school
i
had
reached
the
sixth
grade
when
after
the
christmas
holidays
we
began
to
study
the
life
of
washington
running
through
a
summary
of
the
revolution
and
the
early
days
of
the
republic
it
seemed
to
me
that
all
my
reading
and
study
had
been
idle
until
then
the
reader
the
arithmetic
the
song
book
that
had
so
fascinated
me
until
now
became
suddenly
sober
exercise
books
tools
wherewith
to
hew
a
way
to
the
source
of
inspiration
when
the
teacher
read
to
us
out
of
a
big
book
with
many
bookmarks
in
it
i
sat
rigid
with
attention
in
my
little
chair
my
hands
tightly
clasped
on
the
edge
of
my
desk
and
i
painfully
held
my
breath
to
prevent
sighs
of
disappointment
escaping
as
i
saw
the
teacher
skip
the
parts
between
bookmarks
when
the
class
read
and
it
came
my
turn
my
voice
shook
and
the
book
trembled
in
my
hands
i
could
not
pronounce
the
name
of
george
washington
without
a
pause
never
had
i
prayed
never
had
i
chanted
the
songs
of
david
never
had
i
called
upon
the
most
holy
in
such
utter
reverence
and
worship
as
i
repeated
the
simple
sentences
of
my
child
story
of
the
patriot
i
gazed
with
adoration
at
the
portraits
of
george
and
martha
washington
till
i
could
see
them
with
my
eyes
shut
and
whereas
formerly
my
had
bordered
on
conceit
and
i
thought
myself
an
uncommon
person
parading
my
schoolbooks
through
the
streets
and
swelling
with
pride
when
a
teacher
detained
me
in
conversation
now
i
grew
humble
all
at
once
seeing
how
insignificant
i
was
beside
the
great
as
i
read
about
the
noble
boy
who
would
not
tell
a
lie
to
save
himself
from
punishment
i
was
for
the
first
time
truly
repentant
of
my
sins
formerly
i
had
fasted
and
prayed
and
made
sacrifice
on
the
day
of
atonement
but
it
was
more
than
half
play
in
mimicry
of
my
elders
i
had
no
real
horror
of
sin
and
i
knew
so
many
ways
of
escaping
punishment
i
am
sure
my
family
my
neighbors
my
teachers
in
polotzk
all
my
world
in
fact
strove
together
by
example
and
precept
to
teach
me
goodness
saintliness
had
a
new
incarnation
in
about
every
third
person
i
knew
i
did
respect
the
saints
but
i
could
not
help
seeing
that
most
of
them
were
a
little
bit
stupid
and
that
mischief
was
much
more
fun
than
piety
goodness
as
i
had
known
it
was
respectable
but
not
necessarily
admirable
the
people
i
really
admired
like
my
uncle
solomon
and
cousin
rachel
were
those
who
preached
the
least
and
laughed
the
most
my
sister
frieda
was
perfectly
good
but
she
did
not
think
the
less
of
me
because
i
played
tricks
what
i
loved
in
my
friends
was
not
inimitable
one
could
be
downright
good
if
one
really
wanted
to
one
could
be
learned
if
one
had
books
and
teachers
one
could
sing
funny
songs
and
tell
anecdotes
if
one
travelled
about
and
picked
up
such
things
like
one
uncles
and
cousins
but
a
human
being
strictly
good
perfectly
wise
and
unfailingly
valiant
all
at
the
same
time
i
had
never
heard
or
dreamed
of
this
wonderful
george
washington
was
as
inimitable
as
he
was
irreproachable
even
if
i
had
never
never
told
a
lie
i
could
not
compare
myself
to
george
washington
for
i
was
not
brave
i
was
afraid
to
go
out
when
snowballs
whizzed
and
i
could
never
be
the
first
president
of
the
united
states
so
i
was
forced
to
revise
my
own
estimate
of
myself
but
the
twin
of
my
humility
paradoxical
as
it
may
seem
was
a
sense
of
dignity
i
had
never
known
before
for
if
i
found
that
i
was
a
person
of
small
consequence
i
discovered
at
the
same
time
that
i
was
more
nobly
related
than
i
had
ever
supposed
i
had
relatives
and
friends
who
were
notable
people
by
the
old
standards
i
had
never
been
ashamed
of
my
family
but
this
george
washington
who
died
long
before
i
was
born
was
like
a
king
in
greatness
and
he
and
i
were
fellow
citizens
there
was
a
great
deal
about
fellow
citizens
in
the
patriotic
literature
we
read
at
this
time
and
i
knew
from
my
father
how
he
was
a
citizen
through
the
process
of
naturalization
and
how
i
also
was
a
citizen
by
virtue
of
my
relation
to
him
undoubtedly
i
was
a
fellow
citizen
and
george
washington
was
another
it
thrilled
me
to
realize
what
sudden
greatness
had
fallen
on
me
and
at
the
same
time
it
sobered
me
as
with
a
sense
of
responsibility
i
strove
to
conduct
myself
as
befitted
a
fellow
citizen
before
books
came
into
my
life
i
was
given
to
stargazing
and
daydreaming
when
books
were
given
me
i
fell
upon
them
as
a
glutton
pounces
on
his
meat
after
a
period
of
enforced
starvation
i
lived
with
my
nose
in
a
book
and
took
no
notice
of
the
alternations
of
the
sun
and
stars
but
now
after
the
advent
of
george
washington
and
the
american
revolution
i
began
to
dream
again
i
strayed
on
the
common
after
school
instead
of
hurrying
home
to
read
i
hung
on
fence
rails
my
pet
book
forgotten
under
my
arm
and
gazed
off
to
the
february
sunset
and
beyond
and
beyond
i
was
no
longer
the
central
figure
of
my
dreams
the
dry
weeds
in
the
lane
crackled
beneath
the
tread
of
heroes
what
more
could
america
give
a
child
ah
much
more
as
i
read
how
the
patriots
planned
the
revolution
and
the
women
gave
their
sons
to
die
in
battle
and
the
heroes
led
to
victory
and
the
rejoicing
people
set
up
the
republic
it
dawned
on
me
gradually
what
was
meant
by
the
people
all
desiring
noble
things
and
striving
for
them
together
defying
their
oppressors
giving
their
lives
for
each
other
all
this
it
was
that
made
it
was
not
a
thing
that
i
i
could
not
go
home
and
tell
frieda
about
it
as
i
told
her
other
things
i
learned
at
school
but
i
knew
one
could
say
my
country
and
it
as
one
felt
god
or
myself
my
teacher
my
schoolmates
miss
dillingham
george
washington
himself
could
not
mean
more
than
i
when
they
said
my
country
after
i
had
once
felt
it
for
the
country
was
for
all
the
citizens
and
was
a
and
when
we
stood
up
to
sing
america
i
shouted
the
words
with
all
my
might
i
was
in
very
earnest
proclaiming
to
the
world
my
love
for
my
country
i
love
thy
rocks
and
rills
thy
woods
and
templed
hills
boston
harbor
crescent
beach
chelsea
square
all
was
hallowed
ground
to
me
as
the
day
approached
when
the
school
was
to
hold
exercises
in
honor
of
washington
birthday
the
halls
resounded
at
all
hours
with
the
strains
of
patriotic
songs
and
i
who
was
a
model
of
the
attentive
pupil
more
than
once
lost
my
place
in
the
lesson
as
i
strained
to
hear
through
closed
doors
some
neighboring
class
rehearsing
the
banner
if
the
doors
happened
to
open
and
the
chorus
broke
out
unveiled
o
say
does
that
banner
yet
wave
the
land
of
the
free
and
the
home
of
the
brave
delicious
tremors
ran
up
and
down
my
spine
and
i
was
faint
with
suppressed
enthusiasm
where
had
been
my
country
until
now
what
flag
had
i
loved
what
heroes
had
i
worshipped
the
very
names
of
these
things
had
been
unknown
to
me
well
i
knew
that
polotzk
was
not
my
country
it
was
exile
on
many
occasions
in
the
year
we
prayed
to
god
to
lead
us
out
of
exile
the
beautiful
passover
service
closed
with
the
words
next
year
may
we
be
in
jerusalem
on
childish
lips
indeed
those
words
were
no
conscious
aspiration
we
repeated
the
hebrew
syllables
after
our
elders
but
without
their
hope
and
longing
still
not
a
child
among
us
was
too
young
to
feel
in
his
own
flesh
the
lash
of
the
oppressor
we
knew
what
it
was
to
be
jews
in
exile
from
the
spiteful
treatment
we
suffered
at
the
hands
of
the
smallest
urchin
who
crossed
himself
and
thence
we
knew
that
israel
had
good
reason
to
pray
for
deliverance
but
the
story
of
the
exodus
was
not
history
to
me
in
the
sense
that
the
story
of
the
american
revolution
was
it
was
more
like
a
glorious
myth
a
belief
in
which
had
the
effect
of
cutting
me
off
from
the
actual
world
by
linking
me
with
a
world
of
phantoms
those
moments
of
exaltation
which
the
contemplation
of
the
biblical
past
afforded
us
allowing
us
to
call
ourselves
the
children
of
princes
served
but
to
tinge
with
a
more
poignant
sense
of
disinheritance
the
long
humdrum
stretches
of
our
life
in
very
truth
we
were
a
people
without
a
country
surrounded
by
mocking
foes
and
detractors
it
was
difficult
for
me
to
realize
the
persons
of
my
people
heroes
or
the
events
in
which
they
moved
except
in
moments
of
abstraction
from
the
world
around
me
i
scarcely
understood
that
jerusalem
was
an
actual
spot
on
the
earth
where
once
the
kings
of
the
bible
real
people
like
my
neighbors
in
polotzk
ruled
in
puissant
majesty
for
the
conditions
of
our
civil
life
did
not
permit
us
to
cultivate
a
spirit
of
nationalism
the
freedom
of
worship
that
was
grudgingly
granted
within
the
narrow
limits
of
the
pale
by
no
means
included
the
right
to
set
up
openly
any
ideal
of
a
hebrew
state
any
hero
other
than
the
czar
what
we
children
picked
up
of
our
ancient
political
history
was
confused
with
the
miraculous
story
of
the
creation
with
the
supernatural
legends
and
hazy
associations
of
bible
lore
as
to
our
future
we
jews
in
polotzk
had
no
national
expectations
only
a
dreamer
here
and
there
hoped
to
die
in
palestine
if
fetchke
and
i
sang
with
my
father
first
making
sure
of
our
audience
zion
zion
holy
zion
not
forever
is
it
lost
we
did
not
really
picture
to
ourselves
judæa
restored
so
it
came
to
pass
that
we
did
not
know
what
could
mean
to
a
man
and
as
we
had
no
country
so
we
had
no
flag
to
love
it
was
by
no
symbolism
that
the
banner
of
the
house
of
romanoff
became
the
emblem
of
our
bondage
in
our
eyes
even
a
child
would
know
how
to
hate
the
flag
that
we
were
forced
on
pain
of
severe
penalties
to
hoist
above
our
housetops
in
celebration
of
the
advent
of
one
of
our
oppressors
and
as
it
was
with
country
and
flag
so
it
was
with
heroes
of
war
we
hated
the
uniform
of
the
soldier
to
the
last
brass
button
on
the
person
of
a
gentile
it
was
the
symbol
of
tyranny
on
the
person
of
a
jew
it
was
the
emblem
of
shame
so
a
little
jewish
girl
in
polotzk
was
apt
to
grow
up
and
and
if
still
in
her
outreaching
youth
she
was
set
down
in
a
land
of
outspoken
patriotism
she
was
likely
to
love
her
new
country
with
a
great
love
and
to
embrace
its
heroes
in
a
great
worship
naturalization
with
us
russian
jews
may
mean
more
than
the
adoption
of
the
immigrant
by
america
it
may
mean
the
adoption
of
america
by
the
immigrant
on
the
day
of
the
washington
celebration
i
recited
a
poem
that
i
had
composed
in
my
enthusiasm
but
composed
is
not
the
word
the
process
of
putting
on
paper
the
sentiments
that
seethed
in
my
soul
was
really
very
discomposing
i
dug
the
words
out
of
my
heart
squeezed
the
rhymes
out
of
my
brain
forced
the
missing
syllables
out
of
their
in
the
dictionary
may
i
never
again
know
such
travail
of
the
spirit
as
i
endured
during
the
fevered
days
when
i
was
engaged
on
the
poem
it
was
not
as
if
i
wanted
to
say
that
snow
was
white
or
grass
was
green
i
could
do
that
without
a
dictionary
it
was
a
question
now
of
the
loftiest
sentiments
of
the
most
abstract
truths
the
names
of
which
were
very
new
in
my
vocabulary
it
was
necessary
to
use
polysyllables
and
plenty
of
them
and
where
to
find
rhymes
for
such
words
as
tyranny
freedom
and
justice
when
you
had
less
than
two
years
acquaintance
with
english
the
name
i
wished
to
celebrate
was
the
most
difficult
of
all
nothing
but
washington
rhymed
with
washington
it
was
a
most
ambitious
undertaking
but
my
heart
could
find
no
rest
till
it
had
proclaimed
itself
to
the
world
so
i
wrestled
with
my
difficulties
and
spared
not
ink
till
inspiration
perched
on
my
penpoint
and
my
soul
gave
up
its
best
when
i
had
done
i
was
myself
impressed
with
the
length
gravity
and
nobility
of
my
poem
my
father
was
overcome
with
emotion
as
he
read
it
his
hands
trembled
as
he
held
the
paper
to
the
light
and
the
mist
gathered
in
his
eyes
my
teacher
miss
dwight
was
plainly
astonished
at
my
performance
and
said
many
kind
things
and
asked
many
questions
all
of
which
i
took
very
solemnly
like
one
who
had
been
in
the
clouds
and
returned
to
earth
with
a
sign
upon
him
when
miss
dwight
asked
me
to
read
my
poem
to
the
class
on
the
day
of
celebration
i
readily
consented
it
was
not
in
me
to
refuse
a
chance
to
tell
my
schoolmates
what
i
thought
of
george
washington
i
was
not
a
heroic
figure
when
i
stood
up
in
front
of
the
class
to
pronounce
the
praises
of
the
father
of
his
country
thin
pale
and
hollow
with
a
shadow
of
short
black
curls
on
my
brow
and
the
staring
look
of
prominent
eyes
i
must
have
looked
more
frightened
than
imposing
my
dress
added
no
grace
to
my
appearance
plaids
were
in
fashion
and
my
frock
was
of
a
plaid
that
had
a
ghastly
effect
on
my
complexion
i
hated
it
when
i
thought
of
it
but
on
the
great
day
i
did
not
know
i
had
any
dress
on
heels
clapped
together
and
hands
glued
to
my
sides
i
lifted
up
my
voice
in
praise
of
george
washington
it
was
not
much
of
a
voice
like
my
hollow
cheeks
it
suggested
consumption
my
pronunciation
was
faulty
my
declamation
flat
but
i
had
the
courage
of
my
convictions
i
was
face
to
face
with
twoscore
fellow
citizens
in
clean
blouses
and
extra
frills
i
must
tell
them
what
george
washington
had
done
for
their
country
for
country
for
me
i
can
laugh
now
at
the
impossible
metres
the
grandiose
phrases
the
verbose
repetitions
of
my
poem
years
ago
i
must
have
laughed
at
it
when
i
threw
my
only
copy
into
the
wastebasket
the
copy
i
am
now
turning
over
was
loaned
me
by
miss
dwight
who
faithfully
preserved
it
all
these
years
for
the
sake
no
doubt
of
what
i
strove
to
express
when
i
laboriously
hitched
together
those
dozen
and
more
ungraceful
stanzas
but
to
the
forty
fellow
citizens
sitting
in
rows
in
front
of
me
it
was
no
laughing
matter
even
the
bad
boys
sat
in
attitudes
of
attention
hypnotized
by
the
solemnity
of
my
demeanor
if
they
got
any
inkling
of
what
the
hail
of
big
words
was
about
it
must
have
been
through
occult
suggestion
i
fixed
their
eighty
eyes
with
my
single
stare
and
gave
it
to
them
stanza
after
stanza
with
such
emphasis
as
the
lameness
of
the
lines
permitted
he
whose
courage
will
amazing
bravery
did
free
his
land
from
a
despot
rule
from
man
greatest
evil
almost
slavery
and
all
that
taught
in
tyranny
school
who
gave
his
land
its
liberty
who
was
he
was
he
who
will
be
our
pride
immortal
washington
who
always
did
in
truth
confide
we
hail
our
washington
illustration
twoscore
of
my
public
school
chelsea
the
best
of
the
verses
were
no
better
than
these
but
the
children
listened
they
had
to
presently
i
gave
them
news
declaring
that
washington
wrote
the
famous
constitution
sacred
the
hand
that
this
blessed
guide
to
man
had
given
which
says
one
and
all
of
mankind
are
alike
excepting
none
this
was
received
in
respectful
silence
possibly
because
the
other
fellow
citizens
were
as
hazy
about
historical
facts
as
i
at
this
point
hurrah
for
washington
they
understood
and
three
cheers
for
the
red
white
and
blue
was
only
to
be
expected
on
that
occasion
but
there
ran
a
special
note
through
my
poem
a
thought
that
only
israel
rubinstein
or
beckie
aronovitch
could
have
fully
understood
besides
myself
for
i
made
myself
the
spokesman
of
the
luckless
sons
of
abraham
saying
then
we
weary
hebrew
children
at
last
found
rest
in
the
land
where
reigned
freedom
and
like
a
nest
to
homeless
birds
your
land
proved
to
us
and
therefore
will
we
gratefully
sing
your
praise
evermore
the
boys
and
girls
who
had
never
been
turned
away
from
any
door
because
of
their
father
religion
sat
as
if
fascinated
in
their
places
but
they
woke
up
and
applauded
heartily
when
i
was
done
following
the
example
of
miss
dwight
who
wore
the
happy
face
which
meant
that
one
of
her
pupils
had
done
well
the
recitation
was
repeated
by
request
before
several
other
classes
and
the
applause
was
equally
prolonged
at
each
repetition
after
the
exercises
i
was
surrounded
praised
questioned
and
made
much
of
by
teachers
as
well
as
pupils
plainly
i
had
not
poured
my
praise
of
george
washington
into
deaf
ears
the
teachers
asked
me
if
anybody
had
helped
me
with
the
poem
the
girls
invariably
asked
mary
antin
how
could
you
think
of
all
those
words
none
of
them
thought
of
the
dictionary
if
i
had
been
satisfied
with
my
poem
in
the
first
place
the
applause
with
which
it
was
received
by
my
teachers
and
schoolmates
convinced
me
that
i
had
produced
a
very
fine
thing
indeed
so
the
person
whoever
it
was
perhaps
my
father
who
suggested
that
my
tribute
to
washington
ought
to
be
printed
did
not
find
me
difficult
to
persuade
when
i
had
achieved
an
absolutely
perfect
copy
of
my
verses
at
the
expense
of
a
dozen
sheets
of
note
paper
i
crossed
the
mystic
river
to
boston
and
boldly
invaded
newspaper
row
it
never
occurred
to
me
to
send
my
manuscript
by
mail
in
fact
it
has
never
been
my
way
to
send
a
delegate
where
i
could
go
myself
consciously
or
unconsciously
i
have
always
acted
on
the
motto
of
a
wise
man
who
was
one
of
the
dearest
friends
that
boston
kept
for
me
until
i
came
personal
presence
moves
the
world
said
the
great
hale
and
i
went
in
person
to
beard
the
editor
in
his
armchair
from
the
ferry
slip
to
the
offices
of
the
boston
transcript
the
way
was
long
strange
and
full
of
perils
but
i
kept
resolutely
on
up
hanover
street
being
familiar
with
that
part
of
my
route
till
i
came
to
a
puzzling
corner
there
i
stopped
utterly
bewildered
by
the
tangle
of
streets
the
roar
of
traffic
the
giddy
swarm
of
pedestrians
with
the
precious
manuscript
tightly
clasped
i
balanced
myself
on
the
curbstone
afraid
to
plunge
into
the
boiling
vortex
of
the
crossing
every
time
i
made
a
start
a
clanging
street
car
snatched
up
the
way
i
could
not
even
pick
out
my
street
the
unobtrusive
street
signs
were
lost
to
my
unpractised
sight
in
the
glaring
confusion
of
store
signs
and
advertisements
if
i
accosted
a
pedestrian
to
ask
the
way
i
had
to
speak
several
times
before
i
was
heard
jews
hurrying
by
with
bearded
chins
on
their
bosoms
and
eyes
intent
shrugged
their
shoulders
at
the
name
transcript
and
shrugged
till
they
were
out
of
sight
italians
sauntering
behind
their
fruit
carts
answered
my
inquiry
with
a
lift
of
the
head
that
made
their
earrings
gleam
and
a
wave
of
the
hand
that
referred
me
to
all
four
points
of
the
compass
at
once
i
was
trying
to
catch
the
eye
of
the
tall
policeman
who
stood
grandly
in
the
middle
of
the
crossing
a
stout
pillar
around
which
the
waves
of
traffic
broke
when
deliverance
bellowed
in
my
ear
herald
globe

eh
whatcher

the
tall
newsboy
had
to
stoop
to
me
transcript
sure
and
in
half
a
twinkling
he
had
picked
me
out
a
paper
from
his
bundle
when
i
explained
to
him
he
tucked
the
paper
in
again
piloted
me
across
unravelled
the
end
of
washington
street
for
me
and
with
much
pointing
out
of
landmarks
headed
me
for
my
destination
my
nose
seeking
the
spire
of
the
old
south
church
i
found
the
transcript
building
a
waste
of
corridors
tunnelled
by
a
maze
of
staircases
on
the
doors
were
many
signs
with
the
names
or
nicknames
of
many
persons
city
editor
beggars
and
peddlers
not
allowed
the
nameless
world
not
included
in
these
categories
was
warned
off
forbidden
to
be
or
do
private
no
admittance
do
knock
and
the
various
inhospitable
legends
on
the
doors
and
walls
were
punctuated
by
frequent
cuspidors
on
the
floor
there
was
no
sign
anywhere
of
the
welcome
which
i
as
an
author
expected
to
find
in
the
home
of
a
newspaper
i
was
descending
from
the
top
story
to
the
street
for
the
seventh
time
trying
to
decide
what
kind
of
editor
a
patriotic
poem
belonged
to
when
an
untidy
boy
carrying
broad
paper
streamers
and
whistling
shrilly
in
defiance
of
an
express
prohibition
on
the
wall
bustled
through
the
corridor
and
left
a
door
ajar
i
slipped
in
behind
him
and
found
myself
in
a
room
full
of
editors
i
was
a
little
surprised
at
the
appearance
of
the
editors
i
had
imagined
my
editor
would
look
like
jones
the
principal
of
my
school
whose
coat
was
always
buttoned
and
whose
finger
nails
were
beautiful
these
people
were
in
shirt
sleeves
and
they
smoked
and
they
did
politely
turn
in
their
revolving
chairs
when
i
came
in
and
ask
what
can
i
do
for
you
the
room
was
noisy
with
typewriters
and
nobody
heard
my
please
can
you
tell
me
at
last
one
of
the
machines
stopped
and
the
operator
thought
he
heard
something
in
the
pause
he
looked
up
through
his
own
smoke
i
guess
he
thought
he
saw
something
for
he
stared
it
troubled
me
a
little
to
have
him
stare
so
i
realized
suddenly
that
the
hand
in
which
i
carried
my
manuscript
was
moist
and
i
was
afraid
it
would
make
marks
on
the
paper
i
held
out
the
manuscript
to
the
editor
explaining
that
it
was
a
poem
about
george
washington
and
would
he
please
print
it
in
the
transcript
there
was
something
queer
about
that
particular
editor
the
way
he
stared
and
smiled
made
me
feel
about
eleven
inches
high
and
my
voice
kept
growing
smaller
and
smaller
as
i
neared
the
end
of
my
speech
at
last
he
spoke
laying
down
his
pipe
and
sitting
back
at
his
ease
so
you
have
brought
us
a
poem
my
child
it
about
george
washington
i
repeated
impressively
do
you
want
to
read
it
i
should
be
delighted
my
dear
but
the
fact
is
he
did
not
take
my
paper
he
stood
up
and
called
across
the
room
say
jack
here
is
a
young
lady
who
has
brought
us
a
poem
about
george
wrote
it
yourself
my
dear
wrote
it
all
herself
what
shall
we
do
with
her
jack
came
over
and
another
man
my
editor
made
me
repeat
my
business
and
they
all
looked
interested
but
nobody
took
my
paper
from
me
they
put
their
hands
into
their
pockets
and
my
hand
kept
growing
clammier
all
the
time
the
three
seemed
to
be
consulting
but
i
could
not
understand
what
they
said
or
why
jack
laughed
a
fourth
man
who
had
been
writing
busily
at
a
desk
near
by
broke
in
on
the
consultation
that
enough
boys
he
said
that
enough
take
the
young
lady
to
mr
hurd
hurd
it
was
found
was
away
on
a
vacation
and
of
several
other
editors
in
several
offices
to
whom
i
was
referred
none
proved
to
be
the
proper
editor
to
take
charge
of
a
poem
about
george
washington
at
last
an
elderly
editor
suggested
that
as
hurd
would
be
away
for
some
time
i
would
do
well
to
give
up
the
transcript
and
try
the
herald
across
the
way
a
little
tired
by
my
wanderings
and
bewildered
by
the
complexity
of
the
editorial
system
but
still
confident
about
my
mission
i
picked
my
way
across
washington
street
and
found
the
herald
offices
here
i
had
instant
good
luck
the
first
editor
i
addressed
took
my
paper
and
invited
me
to
a
seat
he
read
my
poem
much
more
quickly
than
i
could
myself
and
said
it
was
very
nice
and
asked
me
some
questions
and
made
notes
on
a
slip
of
paper
which
he
pinned
to
my
manuscript
he
said
he
would
have
my
piece
printed
very
soon
and
would
send
me
a
copy
of
the
issue
in
which
it
appeared
as
i
was
going
i
could
not
help
giving
the
editor
my
hand
although
i
had
not
experienced
any
handshaking
in
newspaper
row
i
felt
that
as
author
and
editor
we
were
on
a
very
pleasant
footing
and
i
gave
him
my
hand
in
token
of
comradeship
i
had
regained
my
full
stature
and
something
over
during
this
cordial
interview
and
when
i
stepped
out
into
the
street
and
saw
the
crowd
intently
studying
the
bulletin
board
i
swelled
out
of
all
proportion
for
i
told
myself
that
i
mary
antin
was
one
of
the
inspired
brotherhood
who
made
newspapers
so
interesting
i
did
not
know
whether
my
poem
would
be
put
upon
the
bulletin
board
but
at
any
rate
it
would
be
in
the
paper
with
my
name
at
the
bottom
like
my
story
about
snow
in
miss
dillingham
school
journal
and
all
these
people
in
the
streets
and
more
thousands
of
people
all
boston
would
read
my
poem
and
learn
my
name
and
wonder
who
i
was
i
smiled
to
myself
in
delicious
amusement
when
a
man
deliberately
put
me
out
of
his
path
as
i
dreamed
my
way
through
the
jostling
crowd
if
he
only
whom
he
was
treating
so
unceremoniously
when
the
paper
with
my
poem
in
it
arrived
the
whole
house
pounced
upon
it
at
once
i
was
surprised
to
find
that
my
verses
were
not
all
over
the
front
page
the
poem
was
a
little
hard
to
find
if
anything
being
tucked
away
in
the
middle
of
the
voluminous
sheet
but
when
we
found
it
it
looked
wonderful
just
like
real
poetry
not
at
all
as
if
somebody
we
knew
had
written
it
it
occupied
a
gratifying
amount
of
space
and
was
introduced
by
a
flattering
biographical
sketch
of
the
author
the
the
material
for
which
the
friendly
editor
had
artfully
drawn
from
me
during
that
happy
interview
and
my
name
as
i
had
prophesied
was
at
the
bottom
when
the
excitement
in
the
house
had
subsided
my
father
took
all
the
change
out
of
the
cash
drawer
and
went
to
buy
up
the
herald
he
did
not
count
the
pennies
he
just
bought
heralds
all
he
could
lay
his
hands
on
and
distributed
them
gratis
to
all
our
friends
relatives
and
acquaintances
to
all
who
could
read
and
to
some
who
could
not
for
weeks
he
carried
a
clipping
from
the
herald
in
his
breast
pocket
and
few
were
the
occasions
when
he
did
not
manage
to
introduce
it
into
the
conversation
he
treasured
that
clipping
as
for
years
he
had
treasured
the
letters
i
wrote
him
from
polotzk
although
my
father
bought
up
most
of
the
issue
containing
my
poem
a
few
hundred
copies
were
left
to
circulate
among
the
general
public
enough
to
spread
the
flame
of
my
patriotic
ardor
and
to
enkindle
a
thousand
sluggish
hearts
really
there
was
something
more
solemn
than
vanity
in
my
satisfaction
pleased
as
i
was
with
my
notoriety
and
nobody
but
i
knew
how
exceedingly
pleased
i
had
a
sober
feeling
about
it
all
i
enjoyed
being
praised
and
admired
and
envied
but
what
gave
a
divine
flavor
to
my
happiness
was
the
idea
that
i
had
publicly
borne
testimony
to
the
goodness
of
my
exalted
hero
to
the
greatness
of
my
adopted
country
i
did
not
discount
the
homage
of
arlington
street
because
i
did
not
properly
rate
the
intelligence
of
its
population
i
took
the
admiration
of
my
schoolmates
without
a
grain
of
salt
it
was
just
so
much
honey
to
me
i
could
not
know
that
what
made
me
great
in
the
eyes
of
my
neighbors
was
that
there
was
a
piece
about
me
in
the
paper
it
mattered
very
little
to
them
what
the
piece
was
about
i
thought
they
really
admired
my
sentiments
on
the
street
in
the
schoolyard
i
was
pointed
out
the
people
said
that
mary
antin
she
had
her
name
in
the
paper
thought
they
said
this
is
she
who
loves
her
country
and
worships
george
washington
to
repeat
i
was
well
aware
that
i
was
something
of
a
celebrity
and
took
all
possible
satisfaction
in
the
fact
yet
i
gave
my
schoolmates
no
occasion
to
call
me
my
vanity
did
not
express
itself
in
strutting
or
wagging
the
head
i
played
tag
and
in
the
schoolyard
and
did
everything
that
was
but
in
the
schoolroom
i
conducted
myself
gravely
as
befitted
one
who
was
preparing
for
the
noble
career
of
a
poet
i
am
forgetting
lizzie
mcdee
i
am
trying
to
give
the
impression
that
i
behaved
with
at
least
outward
modesty
during
my
schoolgirl
triumphs
whereas
lizzie
could
testify
that
she
knew
mary
antin
as
a
vain
boastful
little
jew
for
i
had
a
special
style
of
deportment
for
lizzie
if
there
was
any
girl
in
the
school
besides
me
who
could
keep
near
the
top
of
the
class
all
the
year
through
and
give
bright
answers
when
the
principal
or
the
school
committee
popped
sudden
questions
and
write
rhymes
that
almost
always
rhymed
was
determined
that
that
ambitious
person
should
not
soar
unduly
in
her
own
estimation
so
i
took
care
to
show
lizzie
all
my
poetry
and
when
she
showed
me
hers
i
did
not
admire
it
too
warmly
lizzie
as
i
have
already
said
was
in
a
mood
even
on
week
days
her
verses
all
had
morals
my
poems
were
about
the
crystal
snow
and
the
ocean
blue
and
sweet
spring
and
fleecy
clouds
when
i
tried
to
drag
in
a
moral
it
kicked
so
that
the
music
of
my
lines
went
out
in
a
groan
so
i
had
a
sweet
revenge
when
lizzie
one
day
volunteered
to
bolster
up
the
eloquence
of
jones
the
principal
who
was
lecturing
the
class
for
bad
behavior
by
comparing
the
bad
boy
in
the
schoolroom
to
the
rotten
apple
that
spoils
the
barrelful
the
groans
coughs
feet
shufflings
and
paper
pellets
that
filled
the
room
as
saint
elizabeth
sat
down
even
in
the
principal
presence
were
sweet
balm
to
my
smart
of
envy
i
did
care
if
i
did
know
how
to
moralize
when
my
teacher
had
visitors
i
was
aware
that
i
was
the
show
pupil
of
the
class
i
was
always
made
to
recite
my
compositions
were
passed
around
and
often
i
was
called
up
on
the
platform
oh
climax
of
exaltation
to
be
interviewed
by
the
distinguished
strangers
while
the
class
took
advantage
of
the
teacher
distraction
to
hold
forbidden
intercourse
on
matters
not
prescribed
in
the
curriculum
when
i
returned
to
my
seat
after
such
public
audience
with
the
great
i
looked
to
see
if
lizzie
mcdee
was
taking
notice
and
lizzie
who
was
a
generous
soul
her
airs
notwithstanding
generally
smiled
and
i
forgave
her
her
rhymes
not
but
what
i
paid
a
price
for
my
honors
with
all
my
i
had
a
certain
capacity
for
shyness
even
when
i
arose
to
recite
before
the
customary
audience
of
my
class
i
suffered
from
incipient
stage
fright
and
my
voice
trembled
over
the
first
few
words
when
visitors
were
in
the
room
i
was
even
more
troubled
and
when
i
was
made
the
special
object
of
their
attention
my
triumph
was
marred
by
acute
distress
if
i
was
called
up
to
speak
to
the
visitors
forty
pairs
of
eyes
pricked
me
in
the
back
as
i
went
i
stumbled
in
the
aisle
and
knocked
down
things
that
were
not
at
all
in
my
way
and
my
awkwardness
increasing
my
embarrassment
i
would
gladly
have
changed
places
with
lizzie
or
the
bad
boy
in
the
back
row
anything
only
to
be
less
conspicuous
when
i
found
myself
shaking
hands
with
an
august
or
a
teacher
from
new
york
the
remnants
of
my
vanished
in
awe
and
it
was
in
a
very
husky
voice
that
i
repeated
as
i
was
asked
my
name
lineage
and
personal
history
on
the
whole
i
do
not
think
that
the
found
a
very
forward
creature
in
the
little
girl
with
the
tight
curls
and
the
terrible
plaid
these
awful
audiences
did
not
always
end
with
the
handshaking
sometimes
the
great
personages
asked
me
to
write
to
them
and
exchanged
addresses
with
me
some
of
these
correspondences
continued
through
years
and
were
the
source
of
much
pleasure
on
one
side
at
least
and
arlington
street
took
notice
when
i
received
letters
with
or
letterheads
lizzie
mcdee
also
took
notice
saw
to
that
chapter
xii
miracles
it
was
not
always
in
admiration
that
the
finger
was
pointed
at
me
one
day
i
found
myself
the
centre
of
an
excited
group
in
the
middle
of
the
schoolyard
with
a
dozen
girls
interrupting
each
other
to
express
their
disapproval
of
me
for
i
had
coolly
told
them
in
answer
to
a
question
that
i
did
not
believe
in
god
how
had
i
arrived
at
such
a
conviction
how
had
i
come
from
praying
and
fasting
and
to
extreme
impiety
alas
my
backsliding
had
cost
me
no
travail
of
spirit
always
weak
in
my
faith
playing
at
sanctity
as
i
played
at
soldiers
just
as
i
was
in
the
mood
or
not
i
had
neglected
my
books
of
devotion
and
given
myself
up
to
profane
literature
at
the
first
opportunity
in
vitebsk
and
i
never
took
up
my
prayer
book
again
on
my
return
to
polotzk
america
loomed
so
near
that
my
imagination
was
fully
occupied
and
i
did
not
revive
the
secret
experiments
with
which
i
used
to
test
the
nature
and
intention
of
deity
it
was
more
to
me
that
i
was
going
to
america
than
that
i
might
not
be
going
to
heaven
and
when
we
joined
my
father
and
i
saw
that
he
did
not
wear
the
sacred
fringes
and
did
not
put
on
the
phylacteries
and
pray
i
was
neither
surprised
nor
shocked
remembering
the
sabbath
night
when
he
had
with
his
own
hand
turned
out
the
lamp
when
i
saw
him
go
out
to
work
on
sabbath
exactly
as
on
a
week
day
i
understood
why
god
had
not
annihilated
me
with
his
lightnings
that
time
when
i
purposely
carried
something
in
my
pocket
on
sabbath
there
was
no
god
and
there
was
no
sin
and
i
ran
out
to
play
pleased
to
find
that
i
was
free
like
other
little
girls
in
the
street
instead
of
being
hemmed
about
with
prohibitions
and
obligations
at
every
step
and
yet
if
the
golden
truth
of
judaism
had
not
been
handed
me
in
the
motley
rags
of
formalism
i
might
not
have
been
so
ready
to
put
away
my
religion
it
was
rachel
goldstein
who
provoked
my
avowal
of
atheism
she
asked
if
i
was
going
to
stay
out
of
school
during
passover
and
i
said
no
was
i
a
jew
she
wanted
to
know
no
i
was
i
was
a
freethinker
what
was
that
i
did
believe
in
god
rachel
was
horrified
why
kitty
maloney
believed
in
god
and
kitty
was
only
a
catholic
she
appealed
to
kitty
kitty
maloney
come
over
here
do
you
believe
in
god
there
now
mary
antin
mary
antin
says
she
does
believe
in
god
rachel
goldstein
horror
is
duplicated
kitty
maloney
who
used
to
mock
rachel
jewish
accent
instantly
becomes
her
voluble
ally
and
proceeds
to
annihilate
me
by
plying
me
with
crucial
questions
you
do
believe
in
god
then
who
made
you
mary
antin
nature
made
me
made
you
what
that
it
everything
it
the
trees
no
it
what
makes
the
trees
grow
what
it
is
but
made
the
trees
mary
antin
from
rachel
and
kitty
in
chorus
maggie
listen
to
mary
antin
she
says
there
any
god
she
says
the
trees
made
her
rachel
and
kitty
and
maggie
sadie
and
annie
and
beckie
made
a
circle
around
me
and
pressed
me
with
questions
and
mocked
me
and
threatened
me
with
hell
flames
and
utter
extinction
i
held
my
ground
against
them
all
obstinately
enough
though
my
argument
was
exceedingly
lame
i
glibly
repeated
phrases
i
had
heard
my
father
use
but
i
had
no
real
understanding
of
his
atheistic
doctrines
i
had
been
surprised
into
this
dispute
i
had
no
spontaneous
interest
in
the
subject
my
mind
was
occupied
with
other
things
but
as
the
number
of
my
opponents
grew
and
i
saw
how
unanimously
they
condemned
me
my
indifference
turned
into
a
heat
of
indignation
the
actual
point
at
issue
was
as
little
as
ever
to
me
but
i
perceived
that
a
crowd
of
free
americans
were
disputing
the
right
of
a
fellow
citizen
to
have
any
kind
of
god
she
chose
i
knew
from
my
father
teaching
that
this
persecution
was
contrary
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
i
held
my
ground
as
befitted
the
defender
of
a
cause
george
washington
would
not
have
treated
me
as
rachel
goldstein
and
kitty
maloney
were
doing
this
is
a
free
country
i
reminded
them
in
the
middle
of
the
argument
the
excitement
in
the
yard
amounted
to
a
toy
riot
when
the
school
bell
rang
and
the
children
began
to
file
in
i
stood
out
there
as
long
as
any
of
my
enemies
remained
although
it
was
my
habit
to
go
to
my
room
very
promptly
and
as
the
foes
of
american
liberty
crowded
and
pushed
in
the
line
whispering
to
those
who
had
not
heard
that
a
heretic
had
been
discovered
in
their
midst
the
teacher
who
kept
the
line
in
the
corridor
was
obliged
to
scold
and
pull
the
noisy
ones
into
order
and
sadie
cohen
told
her
in
tones
of
awe
what
the
commotion
was
about
miss
bland
waited
till
the
children
had
filed
in
before
she
asked
me
in
a
tone
encouraging
confidence
to
give
my
version
of
the
story
this
i
did
huskily
but
fearlessly
and
the
teacher
who
was
a
woman
of
tact
did
not
smile
or
commit
herself
in
any
way
she
was
sorry
that
the
children
had
been
rude
to
me
but
she
thought
they
would
not
trouble
me
any
more
if
i
let
the
subject
drop
she
made
me
understand
somewhat
as
miss
dillingham
had
done
on
the
occasion
of
my
whispering
during
prayer
that
it
was
proper
american
conduct
to
avoid
religious
arguments
on
school
territory
i
felt
honored
by
this
private
initiation
into
the
doctrine
of
the
separation
of
church
and
state
and
i
went
to
my
seat
with
a
good
deal
of
dignity
my
alarm
about
the
safety
of
the
constitution
allayed
by
the
teacher
calmness
this
is
not
so
strictly
the
story
of
the
second
generation
that
i
may
not
properly
give
a
brief
account
of
how
it
fared
with
my
mother
when
my
father
undertook
to
purge
his
house
of
superstition
the
process
of
her
emancipation
it
is
true
was
not
obvious
to
me
at
the
time
but
what
i
observed
of
her
outward
conduct
has
been
interpreted
by
my
subsequent
experience
so
that
i
understand
how
it
happens
that
all
the
year
round
my
mother
keeps
the
same
day
of
rest
as
her
gentile
neighbors
but
when
the
ram
horn
blows
on
the
day
of
atonement
calling
upon
israel
to
cleanse
its
heart
from
sin
and
draw
nearer
to
the
god
of
its
fathers
her
soul
is
stirred
as
of
old
and
she
needs
must
join
in
the
ancient
service
it
means
i
have
come
to
know
that
she
has
dropped
the
husk
and
retained
the
kernel
of
judaism
but
years
were
required
for
this
process
of
instinctive
selection
my
father
in
his
ambition
to
make
americans
of
us
was
rather
headlong
and
strenuous
in
his
methods
to
my
mother
on
the
eve
of
departure
for
the
new
world
he
wrote
boldly
that
progressive
jews
in
america
did
not
spend
their
days
in
praying
and
he
urged
her
to
leave
her
wig
in
polotzk
as
a
first
step
of
progress
my
mother
like
the
majority
of
women
in
the
pale
had
all
her
life
taken
her
religion
on
authority
so
she
was
only
fulfilling
her
duty
to
her
husband
when
she
took
his
hint
and
set
out
upon
her
journey
in
her
own
hair
not
that
it
was
done
without
reluctance
the
jewish
faith
in
her
was
deeply
rooted
as
in
the
best
of
jews
it
always
is
the
law
of
the
fathers
was
binding
to
her
and
the
outward
symbols
of
obedience
inseparable
from
the
spirit
but
the
breath
of
revolt
against
orthodox
externals
was
at
this
time
beginning
to
reach
us
in
polotzk
from
the
greater
world
notably
from
america
sons
whose
parents
had
impoverished
themselves
by
paying
the
fine
for
for
military
duty
in
order
to
save
their
darlings
from
the
inevitable
sins
of
violated
judaism
while
in
the
service
sent
home
portraits
of
themselves
with
their
faces
shaved
and
the
grieved
old
fathers
and
mothers
after
offering
up
special
prayers
for
the
renegades
and
giving
charity
in
their
name
exhibited
the
significant
portraits
on
their
parlor
tables
my
mother
own
nephew
went
no
farther
than
vilna
ten
journey
from
polotzk
to
learn
to
cut
his
beard
and
even
within
our
town
limits
young
women
of
education
were
beginning
to
reject
the
wig
after
marriage
a
notorious
example
was
the
beautiful
daughter
of
lozhe
the
rav
who
was
not
restrained
by
her
father
conspicuous
relation
to
judaism
from
exhibiting
her
lovely
black
curls
like
a
maiden
and
it
was
a
further
sign
of
the
times
that
the
rav
did
not
disown
his
daughter
what
wonder
then
that
my
poor
mother
shaken
by
these
foreshadowings
of
revolution
in
our
midst
and
by
the
express
authority
of
her
husband
gave
up
the
emblem
of
matrimonial
chastity
with
but
a
passing
struggle
considering
how
the
heavy
burdens
which
she
had
borne
from
childhood
had
never
allowed
her
time
to
think
for
herself
at
all
but
had
obliged
her
always
to
tread
blindly
in
the
beaten
paths
i
think
it
greatly
to
her
credit
that
in
her
puzzling
situation
she
did
not
lose
her
poise
entirely
bred
to
submission
submit
she
must
and
when
she
perceived
a
conflict
of
authorities
she
prepared
to
accept
the
new
order
of
things
under
which
her
future
was
to
be
formed
wherein
she
showed
her
native
adaptability
the
readiness
to
fall
into
line
which
is
one
of
the
most
charming
traits
of
her
gentle
nature
my
father
gave
my
mother
very
little
time
to
adjust
herself
he
was
only
three
years
from
the
old
world
with
its
settled
prejudices
considering
his
education
he
had
thought
out
a
good
deal
for
himself
but
his
line
of
thinking
had
not
as
yet
brought
him
to
include
woman
in
the
intellectual
emancipation
for
which
he
himself
had
been
so
eager
even
in
russia
this
was
still
in
the
day
when
he
was
astonished
to
learn
that
women
had
written
books
had
used
their
minds
their
imaginations
unaided
he
still
rated
the
mental
capacity
of
the
average
woman
as
only
a
little
above
that
of
the
cattle
she
tended
he
held
it
to
be
a
wife
duty
to
follow
her
husband
in
all
things
he
could
do
all
the
thinking
for
the
family
he
believed
and
being
convinced
that
to
hold
to
the
outward
forms
of
orthodox
judaism
was
to
be
hampered
in
the
race
for
americanization
he
did
not
hesitate
to
order
our
family
life
on
unorthodox
lines
there
was
no
conscious
despotism
in
this
it
was
only
making
manly
haste
to
realize
an
ideal
the
nobility
of
which
there
was
no
one
to
dispute
my
mother
as
we
know
had
not
the
initial
impulse
to
depart
from
ancient
usage
that
my
father
had
in
his
habitual
scepticism
he
had
always
been
a
nonconformist
in
his
heart
she
bore
lovingly
the
yoke
of
prescribed
conduct
individual
freedom
to
him
was
the
only
tolerable
condition
of
life
to
her
it
was
confusion
my
mother
therefore
gradually
divested
herself
at
my
father
bidding
of
the
mantle
of
orthodox
observance
but
the
process
cost
her
many
a
pang
because
the
fabric
of
that
venerable
garment
was
interwoven
with
the
fabric
of
her
soul
my
father
did
not
attempt
to
touch
the
fundamentals
of
her
faith
he
certainly
did
not
forbid
her
to
honor
god
by
loving
her
neighbor
which
is
perhaps
not
far
from
being
the
whole
of
judaism
if
his
loud
denials
of
the
existence
of
god
influenced
her
to
reconsider
her
creed
it
was
merely
an
incidental
result
of
the
freedom
of
expression
he
was
so
eager
to
practise
after
his
life
of
enforced
hypocrisy
as
the
opinions
of
a
mere
woman
on
matters
so
abstract
as
religion
did
not
interest
him
in
the
least
he
counted
it
no
particular
triumph
if
he
observed
that
my
mother
weakened
in
her
faith
as
the
years
went
by
he
allowed
her
to
keep
a
jewish
kitchen
as
long
as
she
pleased
but
he
did
not
want
us
children
to
refuse
invitations
to
the
table
of
our
gentile
neighbors
he
would
have
no
bar
to
our
social
intercourse
with
the
world
around
us
for
only
by
freely
sharing
the
life
of
our
neighbors
could
we
come
into
our
full
inheritance
of
american
freedom
and
opportunity
on
the
holy
days
he
bought
my
mother
a
ticket
for
the
synagogue
but
the
children
he
sent
to
school
on
sabbath
eve
my
mother
might
light
the
consecrated
candles
but
he
kept
the
store
open
until
sunday
morning
my
mother
might
believe
and
worship
as
she
pleased
up
to
the
point
where
her
orthodoxy
began
to
interfere
with
the
american
progress
of
the
family
the
price
that
all
of
us
paid
for
this
disorganization
of
our
family
life
has
been
levied
on
every
immigrant
jewish
household
where
the
first
generation
clings
to
the
traditions
of
the
old
world
while
the
second
generation
leads
the
life
of
the
new
nothing
more
pitiful
could
be
written
in
the
annals
of
the
jews
nothing
more
inevitable
nothing
more
hopeful
hopeful
yes
alike
for
the
jew
and
for
the
country
that
has
given
him
shelter
for
israel
is
not
the
only
party
that
has
put
up
a
forfeit
in
this
contest
the
nations
may
well
sit
by
and
watch
the
struggle
for
humanity
has
a
stake
in
it
i
say
this
whose
life
has
borne
witness
whose
heart
is
heavy
with
revelations
it
has
not
made
and
i
speak
for
thousands
oh
for
thousands
my
gray
hairs
are
too
few
for
me
to
let
these
pages
trespass
the
limit
i
have
set
myself
that
part
of
my
life
which
contains
the
climax
of
my
personal
drama
i
must
leave
to
my
grandchildren
to
record
my
father
might
speak
and
tell
how
in
time
he
discovered
that
in
his
first
violent
rejection
of
everything
old
and
established
he
cast
from
him
much
that
he
afterwards
missed
he
might
tell
to
what
extent
he
later
retraced
his
steps
seeking
to
recover
what
he
had
learned
to
value
anew
how
it
fared
with
his
avowed
irreligion
when
put
to
the
extreme
test
to
what
in
short
his
emancipation
amounted
and
he
like
myself
would
speak
for
thousands
my
grandchildren
for
all
i
know
may
have
a
graver
task
than
i
have
set
them
perhaps
they
may
have
to
testify
that
the
faith
of
israel
is
a
heritage
that
no
heir
in
the
direct
line
has
the
power
to
alienate
from
his
successors
even
i
with
my
limited
perspective
think
it
doubtful
if
the
conversion
of
the
jew
to
any
alien
belief
or
disbelief
is
ever
thoroughly
accomplished
what
positive
affirmation
of
the
persistence
of
judaism
in
the
blood
my
descendants
may
have
to
make
i
may
not
be
present
to
hear
it
would
be
superfluous
to
state
that
none
of
these
hints
and
prophecies
troubled
me
at
the
time
when
i
horrified
the
schoolyard
by
denying
the
existence
of
god
on
the
authority
of
my
father
and
defended
my
right
to
my
atheism
on
the
authority
of
the
constitution
i
considered
myself
absolutely
eternally
delightfully
emancipated
from
the
yoke
of
indefensible
superstitions
i
was
wild
with
indignation
and
pity
when
i
remembered
how
my
poor
brother
had
been
cruelly
tormented
because
he
did
not
want
to
sit
in
heder
and
learn
what
was
after
all
false
or
useless
i
knew
now
why
poor
reb
lebe
had
been
unable
to
answer
my
questions
it
was
because
the
truth
was
not
whispered
outside
america
i
was
very
much
in
love
with
my
enlightenment
and
eager
for
opportunities
to
give
proof
of
it
it
was
miss
dillingham
she
who
helped
me
in
so
many
ways
who
unconsciously
put
me
to
an
early
test
the
result
of
which
gave
me
a
shock
that
i
did
not
get
over
for
many
a
day
she
invited
me
to
tea
one
day
and
i
came
in
much
trepidation
it
was
my
first
entrance
into
a
genuine
american
household
my
first
meal
at
a
gentile
yes
a
christian
board
would
i
know
how
to
behave
properly
i
do
not
know
whether
i
betrayed
my
anxiety
i
am
certain
only
that
i
was
all
eyes
and
ears
that
nothing
should
escape
me
which
might
serve
to
guide
me
this
after
all
was
a
normal
state
for
me
to
be
in
so
i
suppose
i
looked
natural
no
matter
how
much
i
stared
i
had
been
accustomed
to
consider
my
table
manners
irreproachable
but
america
was
not
polotzk
as
my
father
was
ever
saying
so
i
proceeded
very
cautiously
with
my
spoons
and
forks
i
was
cunning
enough
to
try
to
conceal
my
uncertainty
by
being
just
a
little
bit
slow
i
did
not
get
to
any
given
spoon
until
the
others
at
table
had
shown
me
which
it
was
all
went
well
until
a
platter
was
passed
with
a
kind
of
meat
that
was
strange
to
me
some
mischievous
instinct
told
me
that
it
was
ham
forbidden
food
and
i
the
liberal
the
free
was
afraid
to
touch
it
i
had
a
terrible
moment
of
surprise
mortification
but
i
helped
myself
to
a
slice
of
ham
nevertheless
and
hung
my
head
over
my
plate
to
hide
my
confusion
i
was
furious
with
myself
for
my
weakness
i
to
be
afraid
of
a
pink
piece
of
pig
flesh
who
had
defied
at
least
two
religions
in
defence
of
free
thought
and
i
began
to
reduce
my
ham
to
indivisible
atoms
determined
to
eat
more
of
it
than
anybody
at
the
table
alas
i
learned
that
to
eat
in
defence
of
principles
was
not
so
easy
as
to
talk
i
ate
but
only
a
newly
abnegated
jew
can
understand
with
what
squirming
what
protesting
of
the
inner
man
what
exquisite
abhorrence
of
myself
that
spartan
boy
who
allowed
the
stolen
fox
hidden
in
his
bosom
to
consume
his
vitals
rather
than
be
detected
in
the
theft
showed
no
such
miracle
of
as
did
i
sitting
there
at
my
friend
eating
unjewish
meat
and
to
think
that
so
ridiculous
a
thing
as
a
scrap
of
meat
should
be
the
symbol
and
test
of
things
so
august
to
think
that
in
the
mental
life
of
a
child
should
be
reflected
the
struggles
and
triumphs
of
ages
over
and
over
and
over
again
i
discover
that
i
am
a
wonderful
thing
being
human
that
i
am
the
image
of
the
universe
being
myself
that
i
am
the
repository
of
all
the
wisdom
in
the
world
being
alive
and
sane
at
the
beginning
of
this
twentieth
century
the
heir
of
the
ages
am
i
and
all
that
has
been
is
in
me
and
shall
continue
to
be
in
my
immortal
self
chapter
xiii
a
child
paradise
all
this
while
that
i
was
studying
and
exploring
in
the
borderland
between
the
old
life
and
the
new
leaping
at
conclusions
and
sometimes
slipping
finding
inspiration
in
common
things
and
interpretations
in
dumb
things
eagerly
scaling
the
ladder
of
learning
my
eyes
on
peaks
of
ambition
building
up
friendships
that
should
support
my
youth
and
enrich
my
womanhood
learning
to
think
much
of
myself
and
much
more
of
my
world
while
i
was
steadily
gathering
in
my
heritage
sowed
in
the
dim
past
and
ripened
in
the
sun
of
my
own
day
what
was
my
sister
doing
why
what
she
had
always
done
keeping
close
to
my
mother
side
on
the
dreary
marches
of
a
humdrum
life
sensing
sweet
gardens
of
forbidden
joy
but
never
turning
from
the
path
of
duty
i
can
not
believe
but
that
her
sacrifices
tasted
as
dust
and
ashes
to
her
at
times
for
frieda
was
a
mere
girl
whose
childhood
on
the
whole
had
been
gray
while
her
appetite
for
happy
things
was
as
great
as
any
normal
girl
she
had
a
fine
sense
for
what
was
best
in
the
life
about
her
though
she
could
not
articulate
her
appreciation
she
longed
to
possess
the
good
things
but
her
position
in
the
family
forbidding
possession
she
developed
a
talent
for
vicarious
enjoyment
which
i
never
in
this
life
hope
to
imitate
and
her
simple
mind
did
not
busy
itself
with
she
did
not
even
know
why
she
was
happy
she
thought
life
was
good
to
her
still
there
must
have
been
moments
when
she
perceived
that
the
finer
things
were
not
in
themselves
unattainable
but
were
kept
from
her
by
a
social
tyranny
this
i
can
only
surmise
as
in
our
daily
intercourse
she
never
gave
a
sign
of
discontent
we
continued
to
have
part
of
our
life
in
common
for
some
time
after
she
went
to
work
we
formed
ourselves
into
an
evening
school
she
and
i
and
the
two
youngsters
for
the
study
of
english
and
arithmetic
as
soon
as
the
supper
dishes
were
put
away
we
gathered
around
the
kitchen
table
with
books
borrowed
from
school
and
pencils
supplied
by
my
father
with
eager
willingness
i
was
the
teacher
the
others
the
diligent
pupils
and
the
earnestness
with
which
we
labored
was
worthy
of
the
great
things
we
meant
to
achieve
whether
the
results
were
commensurate
with
our
efforts
i
can
not
say
i
only
know
that
cheeks
flamed
with
the
excitement
of
reading
english
monosyllables
and
her
eyes
shone
like
stars
on
a
moonless
night
when
i
explained
to
her
how
she
and
i
and
george
washington
were
fellow
citizens
together
inspired
by
our
studious
evenings
what
frieda
antin
would
not
be
glad
to
sit
all
day
bent
over
the
needle
that
the
family
should
keep
on
its
feet
and
mary
continue
at
school
the
morning
ride
on
the
ferryboat
when
spring
winds
dimpled
the
river
may
have
stirred
her
heart
with
nameless
longings
but
when
she
took
her
place
at
the
machine
her
lot
was
glorified
to
her
and
she
wanted
to
sing
for
the
girls
the
foreman
the
boss
all
talked
about
mary
antin
whose
poems
were
printed
in
an
american
newspaper
wherever
she
went
on
her
humble
business
she
was
sure
to
hear
her
sister
name
for
with
characteristic
loyalty
the
whole
jewish
community
claimed
kinship
with
me
simply
because
i
was
a
jew
and
they
made
much
of
my
small
triumphs
and
pointed
to
me
with
pride
just
as
they
always
do
when
a
jew
distinguishes
himself
in
any
worthy
way
frieda
going
home
from
work
at
sunset
when
rosy
buds
beaded
the
shining
stems
may
have
felt
the
weariness
of
those
who
toil
for
bread
but
when
we
opened
our
books
after
supper
her
spirit
revived
afresh
and
it
was
only
when
the
lamp
began
to
smoke
that
she
thought
of
taking
rest
at
bedtime
she
and
i
chatted
as
we
used
to
do
when
we
were
little
girls
in
polotzk
only
now
instead
of
closing
our
eyes
to
see
imaginary
wonders
according
to
a
bedtime
game
of
ours
we
exchanged
anecdotes
about
the
marvellous
adventures
of
our
american
life
my
contributions
on
these
occasions
were
boastful
accounts
i
have
no
doubt
of
what
i
did
at
school
and
in
the
company
of
men
editors
and
other
notables
and
frieda
delight
in
my
achievements
was
the
very
flower
of
her
fine
sympathy
as
formerly
when
i
had
been
naughty
and
i
invited
her
to
share
in
my
repentance
she
used
to
join
me
in
spiritual
humility
and
solemnly
dedicate
herself
to
a
better
life
so
now
when
i
was
full
of
pride
and
ambition
she
too
felt
the
crown
on
her
brows
and
heard
the
applause
of
future
generations
murmuring
in
her
ear
and
so
partaking
of
her
sister
glory
what
frieda
antin
would
not
say
that
her
portion
was
sufficient
reward
for
a
youth
of
toil
i
did
not
like
my
sister
earn
my
bread
in
those
days
but
let
us
say
that
i
earned
my
salt
by
sweeping
scrubbing
and
scouring
on
saturdays
when
there
was
no
school
my
mother
housekeeping
was
necessarily
irregular
as
she
was
pretty
constantly
occupied
in
the
store
so
there
was
enough
for
us
children
to
do
to
keep
the
bare
rooms
shining
even
here
frieda
did
the
lion
share
it
used
to
take
me
all
saturday
to
accomplish
what
frieda
would
do
with
half
a
dozen
turns
of
her
capable
hands
i
did
not
like
housework
but
i
loved
order
so
i
polished
windows
with
a
will
and
even
got
some
fun
out
of
scrubbing
by
laying
out
the
floor
in
patterns
and
tracing
them
all
around
the
room
in
a
lively
flurry
of
soapsuds
there
is
a
joy
that
comes
from
doing
common
things
well
especially
if
they
seem
hard
to
us
when
i
faced
a
day
housework
i
was
half
paralyzed
with
a
sense
of
inability
and
i
wasted
precious
minutes
walking
around
it
to
see
what
a
very
hard
task
i
had
but
having
pitched
in
and
conquered
it
gave
me
an
exquisite
pleasure
to
survey
my
work
my
hair
tousled
and
my
dress
tucked
up
streaked
arms
bare
to
the
elbow
i
would
step
on
my
heels
over
the
damp
clean
boards
and
pass
my
hand
over
chair
rounds
and
table
legs
to
prove
that
no
dust
was
left
i
could
not
wait
to
put
my
dress
in
order
before
running
out
into
the
street
to
see
how
my
windows
shone
every
workman
who
carries
a
dinner
pail
has
these
moments
of
keen
delight
in
the
product
of
his
drudgery
men
of
genius
likewise
in
their
hours
of
relaxation
from
their
loftier
tasks
prove
this
universal
rule
i
know
a
man
who
fills
a
chair
at
a
great
university
i
have
seen
him
hold
a
roomful
of
otherwise
restless
youths
spellbound
for
an
hour
while
he
discoursed
about
the
respective
inhabitants
of
the
earth
and
sea
at
a
time
when
nothing
walked
on
fewer
than
four
legs
and
i
have
seen
this
scholar
his
ponderous
tomes
shelved
for
a
space
turning
over
and
over
with
cherishing
hands
a
that
he
had
made
out
of
and
paste
and
exhibiting
it
proudly
to
his
friends
for
the
hand
was
the
first
instrument
of
labor
that
distinctive
accomplishment
by
which
man
finally
raised
himself
above
his
cousins
the
lower
animals
and
a
respect
for
the
work
of
the
hand
survives
as
an
instinct
in
all
of
us
the
stretch
of
weeks
from
june
to
september
when
the
schools
were
closed
would
have
been
hard
to
fill
in
had
it
not
been
for
the
public
library
at
first
i
made
myself
a
calendar
of
the
vacation
months
and
every
morning
i
tore
off
a
day
and
comforted
myself
with
the
decreasing
number
of
vacation
days
but
after
i
discovered
the
public
library
i
was
not
impatient
for
the
reopening
of
school
the
library
did
not
open
till
one
in
the
afternoon
and
each
reader
was
allowed
to
take
out
only
one
book
at
a
time
long
before
one
i
was
to
be
seen
on
the
library
steps
waiting
for
the
door
of
paradise
to
open
i
spent
hours
in
the
pleased
with
the
atmosphere
of
books
with
the
order
and
quiet
of
the
place
so
unlike
anything
on
arlington
street
the
sense
of
these
things
permeated
my
consciousness
even
when
i
was
absorbed
in
a
book
just
as
the
rustle
of
pages
turned
and
the
tiptoe
tread
of
the
librarian
reached
my
ear
without
distracting
my
attention
anything
so
wonderful
as
a
library
had
never
been
in
my
life
it
was
even
better
than
school
in
some
ways
one
could
read
and
read
and
learn
and
learn
as
fast
as
one
knew
how
without
being
obliged
to
stop
for
stupid
little
girls
and
inattentive
little
boys
to
catch
up
with
the
lesson
when
i
went
home
from
the
library
i
had
a
book
under
my
arm
and
i
would
finish
it
before
the
library
opened
next
day
no
matter
till
what
hours
of
the
night
i
burned
my
little
lamp
what
books
did
i
read
so
diligently
pretty
nearly
everything
that
came
to
my
hand
i
dare
say
the
librarian
helped
me
select
my
books
but
curiously
enough
i
do
not
remember
something
must
have
directed
me
for
i
read
a
great
many
of
the
books
that
are
written
for
children
of
these
i
remember
with
the
greatest
delight
louisa
alcott
stories
a
less
attractive
series
of
books
was
of
the
sunday
school
type
in
volume
after
volume
a
very
naughty
little
girl
by
the
name
of
lulu
was
always
going
into
tempers
that
her
father
might
have
opportunity
to
lecture
her
and
point
to
her
angelic
little
sister
gracie
as
an
example
of
what
she
should
be
after
which
they
all
felt
better
and
prayed
next
to
louisa
alcott
books
in
my
esteem
were
boys
books
of
adventure
many
of
them
by
horatio
alger
and
i
read
all
i
suppose
of
the
rollo
books
by
jacob
abbott
but
that
was
not
all
i
read
every
kind
of
printed
rubbish
that
came
into
the
house
by
design
or
accident
a
weekly
story
paper
of
a
worse
than
worthless
character
that
circulated
widely
in
our
neighborhood
because
subscribers
were
rewarded
with
a
premium
of
a
diamond
ring
warranted
i
do
know
how
many
karats
occupied
me
for
hours
the
stories
in
this
paper
resembled
in
breathlessness
of
plot
abundance
of
horrors
and
improbability
of
characters
the
things
i
used
to
read
in
vitebsk
the
text
was
illustrated
by
frequent
pictures
in
which
the
villain
generally
had
his
hands
on
the
heroine
throat
while
the
hero
was
bursting
in
through
a
graceful
drapery
to
the
rescue
of
his
beloved
if
a
bundle
came
into
the
house
wrapped
in
a
stained
old
newspaper
i
laboriously
smoothed
out
the
paper
and
read
it
through
i
enjoyed
it
all
and
found
fault
with
nothing
that
i
read
and
as
in
the
case
of
the
vitebsk
readings
i
can
not
find
that
i
suffered
any
harm
of
course
reading
so
many
better
books
there
came
a
time
when
the
story
paper
disgusted
me
but
in
the
beginning
my
appetite
for
print
was
so
enormous
that
i
could
let
nothing
pass
through
my
hands
unread
while
my
taste
was
so
crude
that
nothing
printed
could
offend
me
good
reading
matter
came
into
the
house
from
one
other
source
besides
the
library
the
yiddish
newspapers
of
the
day
were
excellent
and
my
father
subscribed
to
the
best
of
them
since
that
time
yiddish
journalism
has
sadly
degenerated
through
imitation
of
the
vicious
yellow
journals
of
the
american
press
there
was
one
book
in
the
library
over
which
i
pored
very
often
and
that
was
the
encyclopædia
i
turned
usually
to
the
names
of
famous
people
beginning
of
course
with
george
washington
oftenest
of
all
i
read
the
biographical
sketches
of
my
favorite
authors
and
felt
that
the
worthies
must
have
been
glad
to
die
just
to
have
their
names
and
histories
printed
out
in
the
book
of
fame
it
seemed
to
me
the
apotheosis
of
glory
to
be
even
briefly
mentioned
in
an
encyclopædia
and
there
grew
in
me
an
enormous
ambition
that
devoured
all
my
other
ambitions
which
was
no
less
than
this
that
i
should
live
to
know
that
after
my
death
my
name
would
surely
be
printed
in
the
encyclopædia
it
was
such
a
prodigious
thing
to
expect
that
i
kept
the
idea
a
secret
even
from
myself
just
letting
it
lie
where
it
sprouted
in
an
unexplored
corner
of
my
busy
brain
but
it
grew
on
me
in
spite
of
myself
till
finally
i
could
not
resist
the
temptation
to
study
out
the
exact
place
in
the
encyclopædia
where
my
name
would
belong
i
saw
that
it
would
come
not
far
from
alcott
louisa
and
i
covered
my
face
with
my
hands
to
hide
the
silly
baseless
joy
in
it
i
practised
saying
my
name
in
the
encyclopædic
form
antin
mary
and
i
realized
that
it
sounded
chopped
off
and
wondered
if
i
might
not
annex
a
middle
initial
i
wanted
to
ask
my
teacher
about
it
but
i
was
afraid
i
might
betray
my
reasons
for
infatuated
though
i
was
with
the
idea
of
the
greatness
i
might
live
to
attain
i
knew
very
well
that
thus
far
my
claims
to
posthumous
fame
were
ridiculously
unfounded
and
i
did
not
want
to
be
laughed
at
for
my
vanity
spirit
of
all
childhood
forgive
me
forgive
me
for
so
lightly
betraying
a
child
i
that
smile
so
scoffingly
at
the
unsophisticated
child
that
was
myself
have
i
found
any
nobler
thing
in
life
than
my
own
longing
to
be
noble
would
i
not
rather
be
consumed
by
ambitions
that
can
never
be
realized
than
live
in
stupid
acceptance
of
my
neighbor
opinion
of
me
the
statue
in
the
public
square
is
less
a
portrait
of
a
mortal
individual
than
a
symbol
of
the
immortal
aspiration
of
humanity
so
do
not
laugh
at
the
little
boy
playing
at
soldiers
if
he
tells
you
he
is
going
to
hew
the
world
into
good
behavior
when
he
gets
to
be
a
man
and
do
by
all
means
write
my
name
in
the
book
of
fame
saying
she
was
one
who
aspired
for
that
in
condensed
form
is
the
story
of
the
lives
of
the
great
summer
days
are
long
and
the
evenings
we
know
are
as
long
as
the
so
with
all
my
reading
i
had
time
to
play
and
with
all
my
studiousness
i
had
the
will
to
play
my
favorite
playmates
were
boys
it
was
but
mild
fun
to
play
theatre
in
bessie
back
yard
even
if
i
had
leading
parts
which
i
made
impressive
by
recitations
in
russian
no
word
of
which
was
intelligible
to
my
audience
it
was
far
better
sport
to
play
with
the
boys
for
i
enjoyed
the
use
of
my
limbs
what
there
was
of
them
i
was
so
often
reproached
and
teased
for
being
little
that
it
gave
me
great
satisfaction
to
beat
a
boy
to
the
goal
once
a
great
hulky
colored
boy
who
was
the
torment
of
the
neighborhood
treated
me
roughly
while
i
was
playing
on
the
street
my
father
determined
to
teach
the
rascal
a
lesson
for
once
had
him
arrested
and
brought
to
court
the
boy
was
locked
up
overnight
and
he
emerged
from
his
brief
imprisonment
with
a
respect
for
the
rights
and
persons
of
his
neighbors
but
the
moral
of
this
incident
lies
not
herein
what
interested
me
more
than
my
revenge
on
a
bully
was
what
i
saw
of
the
way
in
which
justice
was
actually
administered
in
the
united
states
here
we
were
gathered
in
the
little
courtroom
bearded
arlington
street
against
arlington
street
accused
and
accuser
witnesses
sympathizers
and
all
nobody
cringed
nobody
was
bullied
nobody
lied
who
did
want
to
we
were
all
free
and
all
treated
equally
just
as
it
said
in
the
constitution
the
was
actually
punished
and
not
the
victim
as
might
very
easily
happen
in
a
similar
case
in
russia
liberty
and
justice
for
all
three
cheers
for
the
red
white
and
blue
there
was
one
occasion
in
the
week
when
i
was
ever
willing
to
put
away
my
book
no
matter
how
entrancing
were
its
pages
that
was
on
saturday
night
when
bessie
finklestein
called
for
me
and
bessie
and
i
with
arms
entwined
called
for
sadie
rabinowitch
and
bessie
and
sadie
and
i
still
further
entwined
called
for
annie
reilly
and
bessie
inextricably
wound
up
marched
up
broadway
and
took
possession
of
all
we
saw
heard
guessed
or
desired
from
end
to
end
of
that
main
thoroughfare
of
chelsea
parading
all
abreast
as
many
as
we
were
only
breaking
ranks
to
let
people
pass
leaving
the
imprints
of
our
noses
and
fingers
on
windows
ablaze
with
electric
lights
and
alluring
with
display
inspecting
tons
of
cheap
candy
to
find
a
few
pennies
worth
of
the
most
enduring
kind
the
same
to
be
sucked
and
chewed
by
the
company
turn
and
turn
about
as
we
continued
our
promenade
loitering
wherever
a
crowd
gathered
or
running
for
a
block
or
so
to
cheer
on
the
or
police
ambulance
getting
into
everybody
way
and
just
keeping
clear
of
serious
mischief
we
were
only
girls
we
enjoyed
ourselves
as
only
children
can
whose
fathers
keep
a
basement
grocery
store
whose
mothers
do
their
own
washing
and
whose
sisters
operate
a
machine
for
five
dollars
a
week
had
we
been
boys
i
suppose
bessie
and
sadie
and
the
rest
of
us
would
have
been
a
gang
and
would
have
popped
into
the
chinese
laundry
to
tease
chinky
chinaman
and
been
chased
by
the
cops
from
comfortable
doorsteps
and
had
a
bully
time
of
it
being
what
we
were
we
called
ourselves
a
set
and
we
had
a
lovely
time
as
people
who
passed
us
on
broadway
could
not
fail
to
see
and
hear
for
we
were
at
the
giggling
age
and
broadway
on
saturday
night
was
full
of
giggles
for
us
we
stayed
out
till
all
hours
too
for
arlington
street
had
no
strict
domestic
programme
not
even
in
the
nursery
the
inmates
of
which
were
as
likely
to
be
found
in
the
gutter
as
in
their
cots
at
any
time
this
side
of
one
in
the
morning
there
was
an
element
in
my
enjoyment
that
was
yielded
neither
by
the
sights
the
adventures
nor
the
i
had
a
keen
feeling
for
the
sociability
of
the
crowd
all
plebeian
chelsea
was
abroad
and
a
bourgeois
population
is
nowhere
unneighborly
women
shapeless
with
bundles
their
hats
awry
over
thin
eager
faces
gathered
in
knots
on
the
edge
of
the
curb
boasting
of
their
bargains
little
girls
in
curlpapers
and
little
boys
in
brimless
hats
clung
to
their
skirts
whining
for
pennies
only
to
be
silenced
by
cuffs
a
few
disconsolate
fathers
strayed
behind
these
family
groups
the
rest
being
distributed
between
the
barber
shops
and
the
corner
i
understood
these
people
being
one
of
them
and
i
liked
them
and
i
found
it
all
delightfully
sociable
saturday
night
is
the
workman
wife
night
but
that
does
not
entirely
prevent
my
lady
from
going
abroad
if
only
to
leave
an
order
at
the
florist
so
it
happened
that
bellingham
hill
and
washington
avenue
the
aristocratic
sections
of
chelsea
mingled
with
arlington
street
on
broadway
to
the
further
enhancement
of
my
enjoyment
of
the
occasion
for
i
always
loved
a
mixed
crowd
i
loved
the
contrasts
the
high
lights
and
deep
shadows
and
the
gradations
that
connect
the
two
and
make
all
life
one
i
saw
many
many
things
that
i
was
not
aware
of
seeing
at
the
time
i
only
found
out
afterwards
what
treasures
my
brain
had
stored
up
when
coming
to
the
puzzling
places
in
life
light
and
meaning
would
suddenly
burst
on
me
the
hidden
fruit
of
some
experience
that
had
not
impressed
me
at
the
time
how
many
times
i
wonder
did
i
brush
past
my
destiny
on
broadway
foolishly
staring
after
it
instead
of
going
home
to
pray
i
wonder
did
a
stranger
collide
with
me
and
put
me
patiently
out
of
his
way
wondering
why
such
a
mite
was
not
at
home
and
abed
at
ten
in
the
evening
and
never
dreaming
that
one
day
he
might
have
to
reckon
with
me
did
some
one
smile
down
on
my
childish
glee
i
wonder
unwarned
of
a
day
when
we
should
weep
together
i
wonder
i
wonder
a
million
threads
of
life
and
love
and
sorrow
was
the
common
street
and
whether
we
would
or
not
we
entangled
ourselves
in
a
common
maze
without
paying
the
homage
of
a
second
glance
to
those
who
would
some
day
master
us
too
dull
to
pick
that
face
from
out
the
crowd
which
one
day
would
bend
over
us
in
love
or
pity
or
remorse
what
company
of
skipping
laughing
little
girls
is
to
be
reproached
for
careless
hours
when
men
and
women
on
every
side
stepped
heedlessly
into
the
traps
of
fate
small
sin
it
was
to
annoy
my
neighbor
by
getting
in
his
way
as
i
stared
over
my
shoulder
if
a
grown
man
knew
no
better
than
to
drop
a
word
in
passing
that
might
turn
the
course
of
life
as
a
boulder
rolled
down
from
the
deflects
the
current
of
a
brook
chapter
xiv
manna
so
went
the
life
in
chelsea
for
the
space
of
a
year
or
so
then
my
father
finding
a
discrepancy
between
his
assets
and
liabilities
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
ledger
once
more
struck
tent
collected
his
flock
and
set
out
in
search
of
richer
pastures
there
was
a
charming
simplicity
about
these
proceedings
here
apparently
rooted
there
and
just
as
much
at
home
another
basement
grocery
with
a
freshly
painted
sign
over
the
door
the
broom
in
the
corner
the
loaf
on
the
table
these
things
made
home
for
us
there
were
rather
more
negroes
on
wheeler
street
in
the
lower
south
end
of
boston
than
there
had
been
on
arlington
street
which
promised
more
numerous
outstanding
accounts
but
they
were
a
neighborly
folk
and
they
took
us
strangers
in
sometimes
very
badly
then
there
was
the
school
three
blocks
away
where
america
was
sung
to
the
same
tune
as
in
chelsea
and
geography
was
made
as
dark
a
mystery
it
was
impossible
not
to
feel
at
home
and
presently
lest
anything
be
lacking
to
our
domestic
bliss
there
was
a
new
baby
in
a
borrowed
crib
and
little
dora
had
only
a
few
more
turns
to
take
with
her
battered
doll
carriage
before
a
vehicle
with
a
more
animated
dolly
was
turned
over
to
her
constant
care
the
wheeler
street
neighborhood
is
not
a
place
where
a
refined
young
lady
would
care
to
find
herself
alone
even
in
the
cheery
daylight
if
she
came
at
all
she
would
be
attended
by
a
trusty
escort
she
would
not
get
too
close
to
people
on
the
doorsteps
and
she
would
shrink
away
in
disgust
and
fear
from
a
creature
careering
down
the
sidewalk
on
legs
the
delicate
damsel
would
hasten
home
to
wash
and
purify
and
perfume
herself
till
the
foul
contact
of
wheeler
street
was
utterly
eradicated
and
her
wonted
purity
restored
and
i
do
not
blame
her
i
only
wish
that
she
would
bring
a
little
soap
and
water
and
perfumery
into
wheeler
street
next
time
she
comes
for
some
people
there
may
be
smothering
in
the
filth
which
they
abhor
as
much
as
she
but
from
which
they
can
not
like
her
run
away
illustration
wheeler
street
in
the
lower
south
end
of
boston
many
years
after
my
escape
from
wheeler
street
i
returned
to
see
if
the
place
was
as
bad
as
i
remembered
it
i
found
the
narrow
street
grown
even
narrower
the
sidewalk
not
broad
enough
for
two
to
walk
abreast
the
gutter
choked
with
dust
and
refuse
the
dingy
row
of
tenements
on
either
side
unspeakably
gloomy
i
discovered
what
i
had
not
realized
before
that
wheeler
street
was
a
crooked
lane
connecting
a
corner
saloon
on
shawmut
avenue
with
a
block
of
houses
of
ill
repute
on
corning
street
it
had
been
the
same
in
my
day
but
i
had
not
understood
much
and
i
lived
unharmed
on
this
later
visit
i
walked
slowly
up
one
side
of
the
street
and
down
the
other
remembering
many
things
it
was
eleven
in
the
evening
and
sounds
of
squabbling
coming
through
doors
and
windows
informed
my
experienced
ear
that
a
part
of
wheeler
street
was
going
to
bed
the
grocery
store
in
the
basement
of
number
my
father
old
store
was
still
open
for
business
and
in
the
gutter
in
front
of
the
store
to
be
sure
was
a
happy
baby
just
as
there
used
to
be
i
was
not
alone
on
this
tour
of
inspection
i
was
attended
by
a
trusty
escort
but
i
brought
soap
and
water
with
me
i
am
applying
them
now
i
found
no
fault
with
wheeler
street
when
i
was
fourteen
years
old
on
the
contrary
i
pronounced
it
good
we
had
never
lived
so
near
the
car
tracks
before
and
i
delighted
in
the
moonlike
splendor
of
the
arc
lamp
just
in
front
of
the
saloon
the
space
illumined
by
this
lamp
and
enlivened
by
the
passage
of
many
thirsty
souls
was
the
favorite
playground
for
wheeler
street
youth
on
our
street
there
was
not
room
to
turn
around
here
the
sidewalk
spread
out
wider
as
it
swung
around
to
shawmut
avenue
i
played
with
the
boys
by
preference
as
in
chelsea
i
learned
to
cut
across
the
tracks
in
front
of
an
oncoming
car
and
it
was
great
fun
to
see
the
motorman
angry
face
turn
scared
when
he
thought
i
was
going
to
be
shaved
this
time
sure
it
was
amusing
too
to
watch
the
side
door
of
the
saloon
which
opened
right
opposite
the
grocery
store
and
see
a
drunken
man
put
out
by
the
bartender
the
fellow
would
whine
so
comically
and
cling
to
the
doorpost
so
like
a
damp
leaf
to
a
twig
and
blubber
so
like
a
baby
that
it
was
really
funny
to
see
him
and
there
was
morgan
chapel
it
was
worth
coming
to
wheeler
street
just
for
that
all
the
children
of
the
neighborhood
except
the
most
rowdyish
flocked
to
morgan
chapel
at
least
once
a
week
this
was
on
saturday
evening
when
a
free
entertainment
was
given
consisting
of
music
recitations
and
other
parlor
accomplishments
the
performances
were
exceedingly
artistic
according
to
the
impartial
judgment
of
juvenile
wheeler
street
i
can
speak
with
authority
for
the
crowd
of
us
from
number
we
hung
upon
the
lips
of
the
beautiful
ladies
who
read
or
sang
to
us
and
they
in
turn
did
their
best
recognizing
the
quality
of
our
approval
we
admired
the
miraculously
clean
gentlemen
who
sang
or
played
as
heartily
as
we
applauded
their
performance
sometimes
the
beautiful
ladies
were
accompanied
by
ravishing
little
girls
who
stood
up
in
a
glory
of
golden
curls
frilled
petticoats
and
silk
stockings
to
recite
pathetic
or
comic
pieces
with
trained
expression
and
practised
gestures
that
seemed
to
us
the
perfection
of
the
elocutionary
art
we
were
all
a
little
bit
after
these
entertainments
but
what
was
more
we
were
genuinely
moved
by
the
glimpses
of
a
fairer
world
than
ours
which
we
caught
through
the
music
and
poetry
the
world
in
which
the
beautiful
ladies
dwelt
with
the
fairy
children
and
the
clean
gentlemen
brother
hotchkins
who
managed
these
entertainments
knew
what
he
was
there
for
his
programmes
were
masterly
classics
of
the
lighter
sort
were
judiciously
interspersed
with
the
favorite
street
songs
of
the
day
nothing
that
savored
of
the
chapel
was
there
the
hour
was
honestly
devoted
to
entertainment
the
total
effect
was
an
exquisitely
balanced
compound
of
pleasure
wonder
and
longing
men
with
purple
noses
bristling
chins
and
no
collars
who
slouched
in
sceptically
and
sat
tentatively
on
the
edge
of
the
rear
settees
at
the
beginning
of
the
concert
moved
nearer
the
front
as
the
programme
went
on
and
openly
joined
in
the
applause
at
the
end
scowling
fellows
who
came
in
with
defiant
faces
occasionally
slunk
out
shamefaced
and
both
the
and
the
defiant
sometimes
remained
to
hear
brother
tompkins
pray
and
preach
and
it
was
all
due
to
brother
masterly
programme
the
children
behaved
very
well
for
the
most
part
the
few
toughs
who
came
in
on
purpose
to
make
trouble
were
promptly
expelled
by
brother
hotchkins
and
his
lieutenants
i
could
not
help
admiring
brother
hotchkins
he
was
so
eminently
efficient
in
every
part
of
the
hall
at
every
stage
of
the
proceedings
i
always
believed
that
he
was
the
author
of
the
alluring
notices
that
occupied
the
bulletin
board
every
saturday
though
i
never
knew
it
for
a
fact
the
way
he
handled
the
bad
boys
was
masterly
the
way
he
introduced
the
performers
was
inimitable
the
way
he
did
everything
was
the
best
way
and
yet
i
did
not
like
brother
hotchkins
i
could
not
he
was
too
slim
too
pale
too
fair
his
voice
was
too
encouraging
his
smile
was
too
restrained
the
man
was
a
missionary
and
it
stuck
out
all
over
him
i
could
not
abide
a
missionary
that
was
the
jew
in
me
the
european
jew
trained
by
the
cruel
centuries
of
his
outcast
existence
to
distrust
any
one
who
spoke
of
god
by
any
other
name
than
but
i
should
have
resented
the
suggestion
that
inherited
distrust
was
the
cause
of
my
dislike
for
good
brother
hotchkins
for
i
considered
myself
freed
from
racial
prejudices
by
the
same
triumph
of
my
infallible
judgment
which
had
lifted
from
me
the
yoke
of
credulity
an
uncompromising
atheist
such
as
i
was
at
the
age
of
fourteen
was
bound
to
scorn
all
those
who
sought
to
implant
religion
in
their
fellow
men
and
thereby
prolong
the
reign
of
superstition
of
course
that
was
the
explanation
brother
hotchkins
happily
unconscious
of
my
disapproval
of
his
complexion
arose
at
intervals
behind
the
railing
to
announce
from
a
slip
of
paper
that
the
next
number
on
our
programme
will
be
a
musical
selection
by
etc
until
he
arrived
at
i
am
sure
you
will
all
join
me
in
thanking
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
have
entertained
us
this
evening
and
as
i
moved
towards
the
door
with
my
companions
i
would
hear
his
voice
raised
for
the
inevitable
you
are
all
invited
to
remain
to
a
short
prayer
service
after
which
a
little
louder
refreshments
will
be
served
in
the
vestry
i
will
ask
brother
tompkins
to
the
rest
was
lost
in
the
shuffle
of
feet
about
the
door
and
the
roar
of
electric
cars
glancing
past
each
other
on
opposite
tracks
i
always
got
out
of
the
chapel
before
brother
tompkins
could
do
me
any
harm
as
if
there
was
anything
he
could
steal
from
me
now
that
there
was
no
god
in
my
heart
if
i
were
to
go
back
to
morgan
chapel
now
i
should
stay
to
hear
brother
tompkins
and
as
many
other
brethren
as
might
have
anything
to
say
i
would
sit
very
still
in
my
corner
seat
and
listen
to
the
prayer
and
silently
join
in
the
amen
for
i
know
now
what
wheeler
street
is
and
i
know
what
morgan
chapel
is
there
for
in
the
midst
of
those
crooked
alleys
those
saloons
those
pawnshops
those
gloomy
tenements
it
is
there
to
apply
soap
and
water
and
it
is
doing
that
all
the
time
i
have
learned
since
my
deliverance
from
wheeler
street
that
there
is
more
than
one
road
to
any
given
goal
i
should
look
with
respect
at
brother
hotchkins
applying
soap
and
water
in
his
own
way
convinced
at
last
that
my
way
is
not
the
only
way
men
must
work
with
those
tools
to
the
use
of
which
they
are
best
fitted
by
nature
brother
hotchkins
must
pray
and
i
must
bear
witness
and
another
must
nurse
a
feeble
infant
we
are
all
honest
workmen
and
deserve
in
the
workshop
of
sweating
humanity
it
is
only
the
idle
scoffers
who
stand
by
and
jeer
at
our
efforts
to
cleanse
our
house
that
should
be
kicked
out
of
the
door
as
brother
hotchkins
turned
out
the
rowdies
it
was
characteristic
of
the
looseness
of
our
family
discipline
at
this
time
that
nobody
was
seriously
interested
in
our
visits
to
morgan
chapel
our
time
was
our
own
after
school
duties
and
household
tasks
were
done
joseph
sold
newspapers
after
school
i
swept
and
washed
dishes
dora
minded
the
baby
for
the
rest
we
amused
ourselves
as
best
we
could
father
and
mother
were
preoccupied
with
the
store
day
and
night
and
not
so
much
with
weighing
and
measuring
and
making
change
as
with
figuring
out
how
long
it
would
take
the
outstanding
accounts
to
ruin
the
business
entirely
if
my
mother
had
scruples
against
her
children
resorting
to
a
building
with
a
cross
on
it
she
did
not
have
time
to
formulate
them
if
my
father
heard
us
talking
about
morgan
chapel
he
dismissed
the
subject
with
a
sarcastic
characterization
and
wanted
to
know
if
we
were
going
to
join
the
salvation
army
next
but
he
did
not
seriously
care
and
he
was
willing
that
the
children
should
have
a
good
time
and
if
my
parents
had
objected
to
morgan
chapel
was
the
sidewalk
in
front
of
the
saloon
a
better
place
for
us
children
to
spend
the
evening
they
could
not
have
argued
with
us
very
long
so
they
hardly
argued
at
all
in
polotzk
we
had
been
trained
and
watched
our
days
had
been
regulated
our
conduct
prescribed
in
america
suddenly
we
were
let
loose
on
the
street
why
because
my
father
having
renounced
his
faith
and
my
mother
being
uncertain
of
hers
they
had
no
particular
creed
to
hold
us
to
the
conception
of
a
system
of
ethics
independent
of
religion
could
not
at
once
enter
as
an
active
principle
in
their
life
so
that
they
could
give
a
child
no
reason
why
to
be
truthful
or
kind
and
as
with
religion
so
it
fared
with
other
branches
of
our
domestic
education
chaos
took
the
place
of
system
uncertainty
inconsistency
undermined
discipline
my
parents
knew
only
that
they
desired
us
to
be
like
american
children
and
seeing
how
their
neighbors
gave
their
children
boundless
liberty
they
turned
us
also
loose
never
doubting
but
that
the
american
way
was
the
best
way
in
public
deportment
in
etiquette
in
all
matters
of
social
intercourse
they
had
no
standards
to
go
by
seeing
that
america
was
not
polotzk
in
their
bewilderment
and
uncertainty
they
needs
must
trust
us
children
to
learn
from
such
models
as
the
tenements
afforded
more
than
this
they
must
step
down
from
their
throne
of
parental
authority
and
take
the
law
from
their
children
mouths
for
they
had
no
other
means
of
finding
out
what
was
good
american
form
the
result
was
that
laxity
of
domestic
organization
that
inversion
of
normal
relations
which
makes
for
friction
and
which
sometimes
ends
in
breaking
up
a
family
that
was
formerly
united
and
happy
this
sad
process
of
disintegration
of
home
life
may
be
observed
in
almost
any
immigrant
family
of
our
class
and
with
our
traditions
and
aspirations
it
is
part
of
the
process
of
americanization
an
upheaval
preceding
the
state
of
repose
it
is
the
cross
that
the
first
and
second
generations
must
bear
an
involuntary
sacrifice
for
the
sake
of
the
future
generations
these
are
the
pains
of
adjustment
as
racking
as
the
pains
of
birth
and
as
the
mother
forgets
her
agonies
in
the
bliss
of
clasping
her
babe
to
her
breast
so
the
bent
and
immigrant
forgets
exile
and
homesickness
and
ridicule
and
loss
and
estrangement
when
he
beholds
his
sons
and
daughters
moving
as
americans
among
americans
on
wheeler
street
there
were
no
real
homes
there
were
miserable
flats
of
three
or
four
rooms
or
fewer
in
which
families
that
did
not
practise
race
suicide
cooked
washed
and
ate
slept
from
two
to
four
in
a
bed
in
windowless
bedrooms
quarrelled
in
the
gray
morning
and
made
up
in
the
smoky
evening
tormented
each
other
supported
each
other
saved
each
other
drove
each
other
out
of
the
house
but
there
was
no
common
life
in
any
form
that
means
life
there
was
no
room
for
it
for
one
thing
beds
and
cribs
took
up
most
of
the
floor
space
disorder
packed
the
interspaces
the
centre
table
in
the
parlor
was
not
loaded
with
books
it
held
invariably
a
photograph
album
and
an
ornamental
lamp
with
a
paper
shade
and
the
lamp
was
usually
out
of
order
so
there
was
as
little
motive
for
a
common
life
as
there
was
room
the
yard
was
only
big
enough
for
the
perennial
rubbish
heap
the
narrow
sidewalk
was
crowded
what
were
the
people
to
do
with
themselves
there
were
the
saloons
the
missions
the
libraries
the
cheap
amusement
places
and
the
neighborhood
houses
people
selected
their
resorts
according
to
their
tastes
the
children
let
it
be
thankfully
recorded
flocked
mostly
to
the
clubs
the
little
girls
to
sew
cook
dance
and
play
games
the
little
boys
to
hammer
and
paste
mend
chairs
debate
and
govern
a
toy
republic
all
these
of
course
are
forms
of
baptism
by
soap
and
water
our
neighborhood
went
in
search
of
salvation
to
morgan
memorial
hall
barnard
memorial
morgan
chapel
aforementioned
and
some
other
clean
places
that
lighted
a
candle
in
their
window
my
brother
my
sister
dora
and
i
were
introduced
to
some
of
the
clubs
by
our
young
neighbors
and
we
were
glad
to
go
for
our
home
also
gave
us
little
besides
meals
in
the
kitchen
and
beds
in
the
dark
what
with
the
six
of
us
and
the
store
and
the
baby
and
sometimes
a
greener
or
two
from
polotzk
whom
we
lodged
as
a
matter
of
course
till
they
found
a
permanent
home
what
with
such
a
company
and
the
size
of
our
tenement
we
needed
to
get
out
almost
as
much
as
our
neighbors
children
i
say
almost
for
our
parlor
we
managed
to
keep
pretty
clear
and
the
lamp
on
our
centre
table
was
always
in
order
and
its
light
fell
often
on
an
open
book
still
it
was
part
of
the
life
of
wheeler
street
to
belong
to
clubs
so
we
belonged
i
did
care
for
sewing
or
cooking
so
i
joined
a
and
even
here
i
was
a
failure
i
had
been
a
very
good
dancer
in
russia
but
here
i
found
all
the
steps
different
and
i
did
not
have
the
courage
to
go
out
in
the
middle
of
the
slippery
floor
and
mince
it
and
toe
it
in
front
of
the
teacher
when
i
retired
to
a
corner
and
tried
to
play
dominoes
i
became
suddenly
shy
of
my
partner
and
i
never
could
win
a
game
of
checkers
although
formerly
i
used
to
beat
my
father
at
it
i
tried
to
be
friends
with
a
little
girl
i
had
known
in
chelsea
but
she
met
my
advances
coldly
she
lived
on
appleton
street
which
was
too
aristocratic
to
mix
with
wheeler
street
geraldine
was
studying
elocution
and
she
wore
a
scarlet
cape
and
hood
and
she
was
going
on
the
stage
by
and
by
i
acknowledged
that
her
sense
of
superiority
was
and
retired
farther
into
my
corner
for
the
first
time
conscious
of
my
shabbiness
and
lowliness
i
looked
on
at
the
dancing
until
i
could
endure
it
no
longer
overcome
by
a
sense
of
isolation
and
unfitness
i
slipped
out
of
the
room
avoiding
the
teacher
eye
and
went
home
to
write
melancholy
poetry
what
had
come
over
me
why
was
i
the
confident
the
ambitious
suddenly
grown
so
shy
and
meek
why
was
the
candidate
for
encyclopædic
immortality
overawed
by
a
scarlet
hood
why
did
i
a
very
tomboy
yesterday
suddenly
find
my
playmates
stupid
and
a
bore
i
did
not
know
why
i
only
knew
that
i
was
lonely
and
troubled
and
sore
and
i
went
home
to
write
sad
poetry
i
shall
never
forget
the
pattern
of
the
red
carpet
in
our
parlor
we
had
achieved
a
carpet
since
chelsea
days
because
i
lay
for
hours
face
down
on
the
floor
writing
poetry
on
a
screechy
slate
when
i
had
perfected
my
verses
and
copied
them
fair
on
the
famous
note
paper
and
saw
that
i
had
made
a
very
pathetic
poem
indeed
i
felt
better
and
this
happened
over
and
over
again
i
gave
up
the
i
ceased
to
know
the
rowdy
little
boys
and
i
wrote
melancholy
poetry
oftener
and
felt
better
the
centre
table
became
my
study
i
read
much
and
mooned
between
chapters
and
wrote
long
letters
to
miss
dillingham
for
some
time
i
wrote
to
her
almost
daily
that
was
when
i
found
in
my
heart
such
depths
of
woe
as
i
could
not
pack
into
rhyme
and
finally
there
came
a
day
when
i
could
utter
my
trouble
in
neither
verse
nor
prose
and
i
implored
miss
dillingham
to
come
to
me
and
hear
my
sorrowful
revelations
but
i
did
not
want
her
to
come
to
the
house
in
the
house
there
was
no
privacy
i
could
not
talk
would
she
meet
me
on
boston
common
at
such
and
such
a
time
would
she
she
was
a
devoted
friend
and
a
wise
woman
she
met
me
on
boston
common
it
was
a
gray
autumn
day
was
it
not
actually
drizzling
and
i
was
cold
sitting
on
the
bench
but
i
was
thrilled
through
and
through
with
the
sense
of
the
magnitude
of
my
troubles
and
of
the
romantic
nature
of
the
rendezvous
who
that
was
even
half
awake
when
he
was
growing
up
does
not
know
what
all
these
symptoms
betokened
miss
dillingham
understood
and
she
wisely
gave
me
no
inkling
of
her
diagnosis
she
let
me
talk
and
kept
a
grave
face
she
did
not
belittle
my
troubles
i
made
specific
charges
against
my
home
members
of
my
family
and
life
in
general
she
did
not
say
that
i
would
get
over
them
that
every
growing
girl
suffers
from
the
blues
that
i
was
in
brief
a
little
goose
stretching
my
wings
for
flight
she
told
me
rather
that
it
would
be
noble
to
bear
my
sorrows
bravely
to
soothe
those
who
irritated
me
to
live
each
day
with
all
my
might
she
reminded
me
of
great
men
and
women
who
have
suffered
and
who
overcame
their
troubles
by
living
and
working
and
she
sent
me
home
amazingly
comforted
my
pettiness
and
routed
by
the
quiet
influence
of
her
gray
eyes
searching
mine
this
or
something
like
this
had
to
be
repeated
many
times
as
anybody
will
know
who
was
present
at
the
slow
birth
of
his
manhood
from
now
on
for
some
years
of
course
i
must
weep
and
laugh
out
of
season
stand
on
tiptoe
to
pluck
the
stars
in
heaven
love
and
hate
immoderately
propound
theories
of
the
destiny
of
man
and
not
know
what
is
going
on
in
my
own
heart
chapter

tarnished
laurels
in
the
intervals
of
harkening
to
my
i
was
of
course
still
a
little
girl
as
a
little
girl
in
many
ways
immature
for
my
age
i
finished
my
course
in
the
grammar
school
and
was
graduated
with
honors
four
years
after
my
landing
in
boston
wheeler
street
recognizes
five
great
events
in
a
girl
life
namely
christening
confirmation
graduation
marriage
and
burial
these
occasions
all
require
full
dress
for
the
heroine
and
full
dress
is
forthcoming
no
matter
if
the
family
goes
into
debt
for
it
there
was
not
a
girl
who
came
to
school
in
rags
all
the
year
round
that
did
not
burst
forth
in
sudden
glory
on
graduation
day
fine
muslin
frocks
petticoats
shoes
perishable
hats
gloves
parasols
fans
every
girl
had
them
a
mother
who
had
scrubbed
floors
for
years
to
keep
her
girl
in
school
was
not
going
to
have
her
shamed
in
the
end
for
want
of
a
pretty
dress
so
she
cut
off
the
children
supply
of
butter
and
worked
nights
and
borrowed
and
fell
into
arrears
with
the
rent
and
on
graduation
day
she
felt
magnificently
rewarded
seeing
her
mamie
as
fine
as
any
girl
in
the
school
and
in
order
to
preserve
for
posterity
this
triumphant
spectacle
she
took
mamie
after
the
exercises
to
be
photographed
with
her
diploma
in
one
hand
a
bouquet
in
the
other
and
the
gloves
fan
parasol
and
shoes
in
full
sight
around
a
fancy
table
truly
the
follies
of
the
poor
are
worth
studying
it
did
not
strike
me
as
folly
but
as
the
fulfilment
of
the
portent
of
my
natal
star
when
i
saw
myself
on
graduation
day
arrayed
like
unto
a
princess
frills
lace
shoes
i
had
everything
i
even
had
a
sash
with
silk
fringes
did
i
speak
of
folly
listen
and
i
will
tell
you
quite
another
tale
perhaps
when
you
have
heard
it
you
will
not
be
too
hasty
to
run
and
teach
the
poor
perhaps
you
will
admit
that
the
poor
may
have
something
to
teach
you
before
we
had
been
two
years
in
america
my
sister
frieda
was
engaged
to
be
married
this
was
under
the
old
dispensation
frieda
came
to
america
too
late
to
avail
herself
of
the
gifts
of
an
american
girlhood
had
she
been
two
years
younger
she
might
have
dodged
her
circumstances
evaded
her
fate
she
would
have
gone
to
school
and
imbibed
american
ideas
she
might
have
clung
to
her
girlhood
longer
instead
of
marrying
at
seventeen
i
am
so
fond
of
the
american
way
that
it
has
always
seemed
to
me
a
pitiful
accident
that
my
sister
should
have
come
so
near
and
missed
by
so
little
the
fulfilment
of
my
country
promise
to
women
a
long
girlhood
a
free
choice
in
marriage
and
a
brimful
womanhood
are
the
precious
rights
of
an
american
woman
my
father
was
too
recently
from
the
old
world
to
be
entirely
free
from
the
influence
of
its
social
traditions
he
had
put
frieda
to
work
out
of
necessity
the
necessity
was
hardly
lifted
when
she
had
an
offer
of
marriage
but
my
father
would
not
stand
in
the
way
of
what
he
considered
her
welfare
let
her
escape
from
the
workshop
if
she
had
a
chance
while
the
roses
were
still
in
her
cheeks
if
she
remained
for
ten
years
more
bent
over
the
needle
what
would
she
gain
not
even
her
personal
comfort
for
frieda
never
called
her
earnings
her
own
but
spent
everything
on
the
family
denying
herself
all
but
necessities
the
young
man
who
sued
for
her
was
a
good
workman
earning
fair
wages
of
irreproachable
character
and
refined
manners
my
father
had
known
him
for
years
so
frieda
was
to
be
released
from
the
workshop
the
act
was
really
in
the
nature
of
a
sacrifice
on
my
father
part
for
he
was
still
in
the
woods
financially
and
would
sorely
miss
frieda
wages
the
greater
the
pity
therefore
that
there
was
no
one
to
counsel
him
to
give
america
more
time
with
my
sister
she
attended
the
night
school
she
was
fond
of
reading
in
books
in
a
slowly
ripening
experience
she
might
have
found
a
better
answer
to
the
riddle
of
a
girl
life
than
a
premature
marriage
my
sister
engagement
pleased
me
very
well
our
confidences
were
not
interrupted
and
i
understood
that
she
was
happy
i
was
very
fond
of
moses
rifkin
myself
he
was
the
nicest
young
man
of
my
acquaintance
not
at
all
like
other
workmen
he
was
very
kind
to
us
children
bringing
us
presents
and
taking
us
out
for
excursions
he
had
a
sense
of
humor
and
he
was
going
to
marry
our
frieda
how
could
i
help
being
pleased
the
marriage
was
not
to
take
place
for
some
time
and
in
the
interval
frieda
remained
in
the
shop
she
continued
to
bring
home
all
her
wages
if
she
was
going
to
desert
the
family
she
would
not
let
them
feel
it
sooner
than
she
must
then
all
of
a
sudden
she
turned
spendthrift
she
appropriated
i
do
not
know
what
fabulous
sums
to
spend
just
as
she
pleased
for
once
she
attended
bargain
sales
and
brought
away
such
finery
as
had
never
graced
our
flat
before
home
from
work
in
the
evening
after
a
hurried
supper
she
shut
herself
up
in
the
parlor
and
cut
and
snipped
and
measured
and
basted
and
stitched
as
if
there
were
nothing
else
in
the
world
to
do
it
was
early
summer
and
the
air
had
a
wooing
touch
even
on
wheeler
street
moses
rifkin
came
and
i
suppose
he
also
had
a
wooing
touch
but
frieda
only
smiled
and
shook
her
head
and
as
her
mouth
was
full
of
pins
it
was
physically
impossible
for
moses
to
argue
she
remained
all
evening
in
a
white
disorder
of
tucked
breadths
curled
ruffles
dismembered
sleeves
and
swirls
of
fresh
lace
her
needle
glancing
in
the
lamplight
and
poor
moses
picking
up
her
spools
her
trousseau
was
it
not
no
not
her
trousseau
it
was
my
graduation
dress
on
which
she
was
so
intent
and
when
it
was
finished
and
was
pronounced
a
most
beautiful
dress
and
she
ought
to
have
been
satisfied
frieda
went
to
the
shops
once
more
and
bought
the
sash
with
the
silk
fringes
the
improvidence
of
the
poor
is
a
most
distressing
spectacle
to
all
students
of
sociology
but
please
spare
me
your
homily
this
time
it
does
not
apply
the
poor
are
the
poor
in
spirit
those
who
are
rich
in
spiritual
endowment
will
never
be
found
bankrupt
graduation
day
was
nothing
less
than
a
triumph
for
me
it
was
not
only
that
i
had
two
pieces
to
speak
one
of
them
an
original
composition
it
was
more
because
i
was
known
in
my
school
district
as
the
smartest
girl
in
the
class
and
all
eyes
were
turned
on
the
prodigy
and
i
was
aware
of
it
i
was
aware
of
everything
that
is
why
i
am
able
to
tell
you
everything
now
the
assembly
hall
was
crowded
to
bursting
but
my
friends
had
no
trouble
in
finding
seats
they
were
ushered
up
to
the
platform
which
was
reserved
for
guests
of
honor
i
was
very
proud
to
see
my
friends
treated
with
such
distinction
my
parents
were
there
and
frieda
of
course
miss
dillingham
and
some
others
of
my
chelsea
teachers
a
dozen
or
so
of
my
humbler
friends
and
acquaintances
were
scattered
among
the
crowd
on
the
floor
when
i
stepped
up
on
the
stage
to
read
my
composition
i
was
seized
with
stage
fright
the
floor
under
my
feet
and
the
air
around
me
were
oppressively
present
to
my
senses
while
my
own
hand
i
could
not
have
located
i
did
not
know
where
my
body
began
or
ended
i
was
so
conscious
of
my
gloves
my
shoes
my
flowing
sash
my
wonderful
dress
in
which
i
had
taken
so
much
satisfaction
gave
me
the
most
trouble
i
was
suddenly
paralyzed
by
a
conviction
that
it
was
too
short
and
it
seemed
to
me
i
stood
on
absurdly
long
legs
and
ten
thousand
people
were
looking
up
at
me
it
was
horrible
i
suppose
i
no
more
than
cleared
my
throat
before
i
began
to
read
but
to
me
it
seemed
that
i
stood
petrified
for
an
age
an
awful
silence
booming
in
my
ears
my
voice
when
at
last
i
began
sounded
far
away
i
thought
that
nobody
could
hear
me
but
i
kept
on
mechanically
for
i
had
rehearsed
many
times
and
as
i
read
i
gradually
forgot
myself
forgot
the
place
and
the
occasion
the
people
looking
up
at
me
heard
the
story
of
a
beautiful
little
boy
my
cousin
whom
i
had
loved
very
dearly
and
who
died
in
russia
some
years
after
i
came
to
america
my
composition
was
not
a
masterpiece
it
was
merely
good
for
a
girl
of
fifteen
but
i
had
written
that
i
still
loved
the
little
cousin
and
i
made
a
thousand
strangers
feel
it
and
before
the
applause
there
was
a
moment
of
stillness
in
the
great
hall
after
the
singing
and
reading
by
the
class
there
were
the
customary
addresses
by
distinguished
guests
we
girls
were
reminded
that
we
were
going
to
be
women
and
happiness
was
promised
to
those
of
us
who
would
aim
to
be
noble
women
a
great
many
trite
and
obvious
things
a
great
deal
of
the
rhetoric
appropriate
to
the
occasion
compliments
applause
general
satisfaction
so
went
the
programme
much
of
the
rhetoric
many
of
the
fine
sentiments
did
not
penetrate
to
the
thoughts
of
us
for
whom
they
were
intended
because
we
were
in
such
a
flutter
about
our
ruffles
and
ribbons
and
could
hardly
refrain
from
openly
prinking
but
we
applauded
very
heartily
every
speaker
and
every
speaker
understanding
that
by
a
consensus
of
opinion
on
the
platform
we
were
very
fine
young
ladies
and
much
was
to
be
expected
of
us
one
of
the
last
speakers
was
introduced
as
a
member
of
the
school
board
he
began
like
all
the
rest
of
them
but
he
ended
differently
abandoning
generalities
he
went
on
to
tell
the
story
of
a
particular
schoolgirl
a
pupil
in
a
boston
school
whose
phenomenal
career
might
serve
as
an
illustration
of
what
the
american
system
of
free
education
and
the
european
immigrant
could
make
of
each
other
he
had
not
got
very
far
when
i
realized
to
my
great
surprise
and
no
small
delight
that
he
was
telling
my
story
i
saw
my
friends
on
the
platform
beaming
behind
the
speaker
and
i
heard
my
name
whispered
in
the
audience
i
had
been
so
much
of
a
celebrity
in
a
small
local
way
that
identification
of
the
speaker
heroine
was
inevitable
my
classmates
of
course
guessed
the
name
and
they
turned
to
look
at
me
and
nudged
me
and
all
but
pointed
at
me
their
new
muslins
rustling
and
silk
ribbons
hissing
one
or
two
nearest
me
forgot
etiquette
so
far
as
to
whisper
to
me
mary
antin
they
said
as
the
speaker
sat
down
amid
a
burst
of
the
most
enthusiastic
applause
mary
antin
why
do
you
get
up
and
thank
him
i
was
dazed
with
all
that
had
happened
bursting
with
pride
i
was
but
i
was
moved
too
by
nobler
feelings
i
realized
in
a
vague
way
what
it
meant
to
my
father
and
mother
to
be
sitting
there
and
seeing
me
held
up
as
a
paragon
my
history
made
the
theme
of
an
eloquent
discourse
what
it
meant
to
my
father
to
see
his
ambitious
hopes
thus
gloriously
fulfilled
his
judgment
of
me
verified
what
it
meant
to
frieda
to
hear
me
all
but
named
with
such
honor
with
all
these
things
choking
my
heart
to
overflowing
my
wits
forsook
me
if
i
had
had
any
at
all
that
day
the
audience
was
stirring
and
whispering
so
that
i
could
hear
who
is
it
is
that
so
and
again
they
prompted
me
mary
antin
get
up
get
up
and
thank
him
mary
and
i
rose
where
i
sat
and
in
a
voice
that
sounded
thin
as
a
after
the
oratorical
bass
of
the
last
speaker
i
began
i
want
to
thank
you
that
is
as
far
as
i
got
swan
the
principal
waved
his
hand
to
silence
me
and
then
and
only
then
did
i
realize
the
enormity
of
what
i
had
done
my
eulogist
had
had
the
good
taste
not
to
mention
names
and
i
had
been
brazenly
forward
deliberately
calling
attention
to
myself
when
there
was
no
need
oh
it
was
sickening
i
hated
myself
i
hated
with
all
my
heart
the
girls
who
had
prompted
me
to
such
immodest
conduct
i
wished
the
ground
would
yawn
and
snap
me
up
i
was
ashamed
to
look
up
at
my
friends
on
the
platform
what
was
miss
dillingham
thinking
of
me
oh
what
a
fool
i
had
been
i
had
ruined
my
own
triumph
i
had
disgraced
myself
and
my
friends
and
poor
swan
and
the
winthrop
school
the
monster
vanity
had
sucked
out
my
wits
and
left
me
a
staring
idiot
it
is
easy
to
say
that
i
was
making
a
mountain
out
of
a
mole
hill
a
catastrophe
out
of
a
mere
breach
of
good
manners
it
is
easy
to
say
that
but
i
know
that
i
suffered
agonies
of
shame
after
the
exercises
when
the
crowd
pressed
in
all
directions
in
search
of
friends
i
tried
in
vain
to
get
out
of
the
hall
i
was
mobbed
i
was
lionized
everybody
wanted
to
shake
hands
with
the
prodigy
of
the
day
and
they
knew
who
it
was
i
had
made
sure
of
that
i
had
exhibited
myself
the
people
smiled
on
me
flattered
me
passed
me
on
from
one
to
another
i
smirked
back
but
i
did
not
know
what
i
said
i
was
wild
to
be
clear
of
the
building
i
thought
everybody
mocked
me
all
my
roses
had
turned
to
ashes
and
all
through
my
own
brazen
conduct
i
would
have
given
my
diploma
to
have
miss
dillingham
know
how
the
thing
had
happened
but
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
speak
first
if
she
would
ask
me
but
nobody
asked
nobody
looked
away
from
me
everybody
congratulated
me
and
my
father
and
mother
and
my
remotest
relations
but
the
sting
of
shame
smarted
just
the
same
i
could
not
be
consoled
i
had
made
a
fool
of
myself
swan
had
publicly
put
me
down
ah
so
that
was
it
vanity
was
the
vital
spot
again
it
was
wounded
vanity
that
writhed
and
squirmed
it
was
not
because
i
had
been
bold
but
because
i
had
been
pronounced
bold
that
i
suffered
so
monstrously
if
swan
with
an
eloquent
gesture
had
not
silenced
me
i
might
have
made
my
little
speech
good
heavens
what
i
mean
to
say
and
probably
called
it
another
feather
in
my
bonnet
but
he
had
stopped
me
promptly
disgusted
with
my
forwardness
and
he
had
shown
before
all
those
hundreds
what
he
thought
of
me
therein
lay
the
sting
with
all
my
talent
for
it
took
me
a
long
time
to
realize
the
essential
pettiness
of
my
trouble
for
years
actually
for
years
after
that
eventful
day
of
mingled
triumph
and
disgrace
i
could
not
think
of
the
unhappy
incident
without
inward
squirming
i
remember
distinctly
how
the
little
scene
would
suddenly
flash
upon
me
at
night
as
i
lay
awake
in
bed
and
i
would
turn
over
impatiently
as
if
to
shake
off
a
nightmare
and
this
so
long
after
the
occurrence
that
i
was
myself
amazed
at
the
persistence
of
the
nightmare
i
had
never
been
reproached
by
any
one
for
my
conduct
on
graduation
day
why
could
i
not
forgive
myself
i
studied
the
matter
deeply
it
wearies
me
to
remember
how
deeply
till
at
last
i
understood
that
it
was
wounded
vanity
that
hurt
so
and
no
nobler
remorse
then
and
only
then
was
the
ghost
laid
if
it
ever
tried
to
get
up
again
after
that
i
only
had
to
call
it
names
to
see
it
scurry
back
to
its
grave
and
pull
the
sod
down
after
it
before
i
had
laid
my
ghost
a
friend
told
me
of
a
similar
experience
of
his
boyhood
he
was
present
at
a
small
private
entertainment
and
a
violinist
who
should
have
played
being
absent
the
host
asked
for
a
volunteer
to
take
his
place
my
friend
then
a
boy
in
his
teens
offered
himself
and
actually
stood
up
with
the
violin
in
his
hands
as
if
to
play
but
he
could
not
even
hold
the
instrument
properly
he
had
never
been
taught
the
violin
he
told
me
he
never
knew
what
possessed
him
to
get
up
and
make
a
fool
of
himself
before
a
roomful
of
people
but
he
was
certain
that
ten
thousand
imps
possessed
him
and
tormented
him
for
years
and
years
after
if
only
he
remembered
the
incident
my
friend
confession
was
such
a
consolation
to
me
that
i
could
not
help
thinking
i
might
do
some
other
poor
wretch
a
world
of
good
by
offering
him
my
company
and
that
of
my
friend
in
his
misery
for
if
it
took
me
a
long
time
to
find
out
that
i
was
a
vain
fool
the
corollary
did
not
escape
me
there
must
be
other
vain
fools

a
gate
of
paradise
a
window
facing
on
a
broad
avenue
of
life
dover
street
was
a
prison
a
school
of
discipline
a
battlefield
of
sordid
strife
the
air
in
dover
street
was
heavy
with
evil
odors
of
degradation
but
a
breath
from
the
uppermost
heavens
rippled
through
whispering
of
infinite
things
in
dover
street
the
dragon
poverty
gripped
me
for
a
last
fight
but
i
overthrew
the
hideous
creature
and
sat
on
his
neck
as
on
a
throne
in
dover
street
i
was
shackled
with
a
hundred
chains
of
disadvantage
but
with
one
free
hand
i
planted
little
seeds
right
there
in
the
mud
of
shame
that
blossomed
into
the
honeyed
rose
of
widest
freedom
in
dover
street
there
was
often
no
loaf
on
the
table
but
the
hand
of
some
noble
friend
was
ever
in
mine
the
night
in
dover
street
was
rent
with
the
cries
of
wrong
but
the
thunders
of
truth
crashed
through
the
pitiful
clamor
and
died
out
in
prophetic
silences
outwardly
dover
street
is
a
noisy
thoroughfare
cut
through
a
south
end
slum
in
every
essential
the
same
as
wheeler
street
turn
down
any
street
in
the
slums
at
random
and
call
it
by
whatever
name
you
please
you
will
observe
there
the
same
fashions
of
life
death
and
endurance
every
one
of
those
streets
is
a
rubbish
heap
of
damaged
humanity
and
it
will
take
a
powerful
broom
and
an
ocean
of
soapsuds
to
clean
it
out
dover
street
is
intersected
near
its
eastern
end
where
we
lived
by
harrison
avenue
that
street
is
to
the
south
end
what
salem
street
is
to
the
north
end
it
is
the
heart
of
the
south
end
ghetto
for
the
greater
part
of
its
length
although
its
northern
end
belongs
to
the
realm
of
chinatown
its
multifarious
business
bursts
through
the
narrow
shop
doors
and
overruns
the
basements
the
sidewalk
the
street
itself
in
pushcarts
and
stands
its
multitudinous
population
bursts
through
the
greasy
tenement
doors
and
floods
the
corridors
the
doorsteps
the
gutters
the
side
streets
pushing
in
and
out
among
the
pushcarts
all
day
long
and
half
the
night
besides
rarely
as
harrison
avenue
is
caught
asleep
even
more
rarely
is
it
found
clean
nothing
less
than
a
fire
or
flood
would
cleanse
this
street
even
passover
can
not
quite
accomplish
this
feat
for
although
the
tenements
may
be
scrubbed
to
their
remotest
corners
on
this
one
occasion
the
cleansing
stops
at
the
curbstone
a
great
deal
of
the
filthy
rubbish
accumulated
in
a
year
is
pitched
into
the
street
often
through
the
windows
and
what
the
ashman
on
his
daily
round
does
not
remove
is
left
to
be
trampled
to
powder
in
which
form
it
steals
back
into
the
houses
from
which
it
was
so
lately
removed
the
city
fathers
provide
soap
and
water
for
the
slums
in
the
form
of
excellent
schools
kindergartens
and
branch
libraries
and
there
they
stop
at
the
curbstone
of
the
people
life
they
cleanse
and
discipline
the
children
minds
but
their
bodies
they
pitch
into
the
gutter
for
there
are
no
parks
and
almost
no
playgrounds
in
the
harrison
avenue
district
in
my
day
there
were
none
and
such
as
there
are
have
been
wrenched
from
the
city
by
citizens
who
have
no
offices
in
city
hall
no
wonder
the
ashman
is
not
more
thorough
he
learns
from
his
masters
it
is
a
pity
to
have
it
so
in
a
queen
of
enlightened
cities
like
boston
if
we
of
the
twentieth
century
do
not
believe
in
baseball
as
much
as
in
philosophy
we
have
not
learned
the
lesson
of
modern
science
which
teaches
among
other
things
that
the
body
is
the
nursery
of
the
soul
the
instrument
of
our
moral
development
the
secret
chart
of
our
devious
progress
from
worm
to
man
the
great
achievement
of
recent
science
of
which
we
are
so
proud
has
been
the
deciphering
of
the
hieroglyphic
of
organic
nature
to
worship
the
facts
and
neglect
the
implications
of
the
message
of
science
is
to
applaud
the
drama
without
taking
the
moral
to
heart
and
we
certainly
are
not
taking
the
moral
to
heart
when
we
try
to
make
a
hero
out
of
the
boy
by
such
foreign
appliances
as
grammar
and
algebra
while
utterly
despising
the
fittest
instrument
for
his
uplifting
the
own
body
we
had
no
particular
reason
for
coming
to
dover
street
it
might
just
as
well
have
been
applepie
alley
for
my
father
had
sold
with
the
goods
fixtures
and
of
the
wheeler
street
store
all
his
hopes
of
ever
making
a
living
in
the
grocery
trade
and
i
doubt
if
he
got
a
silver
dollar
the
more
for
them
we
had
to
live
somewhere
even
if
we
were
not
making
a
living
so
we
came
to
dover
street
where
tenements
were
cheap
by
which
i
mean
that
rent
was
low
the
ultimate
cost
of
life
in
those
tenements
in
terms
of
human
happiness
is
high
enough
our
new
home
consisted
of
five
small
rooms
up
two
flights
of
stairs
with
the
right
of
way
through
the
dark
corridors
in
the
parlor
the
dingy
paper
hung
in
rags
and
the
plaster
fell
in
chunks
one
of
the
bedrooms
was
absolutely
dark
and
the
kitchen
windows
looked
out
on
a
dirty
court
at
the
back
of
which
was
the
rear
tenement
of
the
estate
to
us
belonged
along
with
the
five
rooms
and
the
right
of
way
aforesaid
a
block
of
upper
space
the
length
of
a
pulley
line
across
this
court
and
the
width
of
an
arc
described
by
a
windy
monday
wash
in
its
remotest
wanderings
illustration
harrison
avenue
is
the
heart
of
the
south
end
ghetto
the
little
front
bedroom
was
assigned
to
me
with
only
one
partner
my
sister
dora
a
mouse
could
not
have
led
a
cat
much
of
a
chase
across
this
room
still
we
found
space
for
a
narrow
bed
a
crazy
bureau
and
a
small
table
from
the
window
there
was
an
unobstructed
view
of
a
lumberyard
beyond
which
frowned
the
blackened
walls
of
a
factory
the
fence
of
the
lumberyard
was
gay
with
theatre
posters
and
illustrated
advertisements
of
tobacco
whiskey
and
patent
baby
foods
when
the
window
was
open
there
was
a
constant
clang
and
whirr
of
electric
cars
varied
by
the
screech
of
machinery
the
clatter
of
empty
wagons
or
the
rumble
of
heavy
trucks
there
was
nothing
worse
in
all
this
than
we
had
had
before
since
our
exile
from
crescent
beach
but
i
did
not
take
the
same
delight
in
the
propinquity
of
electric
cars
and
arc
lights
that
i
had
till
now
i
suppose
the
tenement
began
to
pall
on
me
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
i
enjoyed
any
degree
of
privacy
because
i
had
half
a
room
to
myself
we
were
six
in
the
five
rooms
we
were
bound
to
be
always
in
each
other
way
and
as
it
was
within
our
flat
so
it
was
in
the
house
as
a
whole
all
doors
beginning
with
the
street
door
stood
open
most
of
the
time
or
if
they
were
closed
the
tenants
did
not
wear
out
their
knuckles
knocking
for
admittance
i
could
stand
at
any
time
in
the
unswept
entrance
hall
and
tell
from
an
analysis
of
the
medley
of
sounds
and
smells
that
issued
from
doors
ajar
what
was
going
on
in
the
several
flats
from
below
up
that
guttural
scolding
voice
unremittent
as
the
hissing
of
a
steam
pipe
is
rasnosky
i
make
a
guess
that
she
is
chastising
the
infant
isaac
for
taking
a
second
lump
of
sugar
in
his
tea
bam
yes
and
she
is
rubbing
in
her
objections
with
the
flat
of
her
hand
that
blubbering
and
moaning
accompanying
an
elephantine
tread
is
fat
casey
second
floor
home
drunk
from
an
afternoon
out
in
fear
of
the
vengeance
of
casey
to
propitiate
whom
she
is
burning
a
pan
of
bacon
as
the
choking
fumes
and
outrageous
sizzling
testify
i
hear
a
feeble
whining
interrupted
by
long
silences
it
is
that
scabby
baby
on
the
third
floor
fallen
out
of
bed
again
with
nobody
home
to
pick
him
up
to
escape
from
these
various
horrors
i
ascend
to
the
roof
where
bacon
and
babies
and
are
not
but
there
i
find
two
figures
in
calico
wrappers
with
bare
red
arms
akimbo
a
basket
of
wet
clothes
in
front
of
each
and
only
one
empty
between
them
i
do
not
want
to
be
dragged
in
as
a
witness
in
a
case
of
assault
and
battery
so
i
descend
to
the
street
again
grateful
to
note
as
i
pass
that
the
baby
is
still
in
front
of
the
door
i
squeeze
through
a
group
of
children
they
are
going
to
play
tag
and
are
counting
to
see
who
should
be
it
if
the
children
couplet
does
not
give
a
vivid
picture
of
the
life
manners
and
customs
of
dover
street
no
description
of
mine
can
ever
do
so
frieda
was
married
before
we
came
to
dover
street
and
went
to
live
in
east
boston
this
left
me
the
eldest
of
the
children
at
home
whether
on
this
account
or
because
i
was
outgrowing
my
childish
carelessness
or
because
i
began
to
believe
on
the
cumulative
evidence
of
the
crescent
beach
chelsea
and
wheeler
street
adventures
that
america
after
all
was
not
going
to
provide
for
my
father
family
whether
for
any
or
all
of
these
reasons
i
began
at
this
time
to
take
matters
more
to
heart
and
to
ponder
ways
and
means
of
getting
rich
my
father
sought
employment
wherever
work
was
going
on
his
health
was
poor
he
aged
very
fast
nevertheless
he
offered
himself
for
every
kind
of
labor
he
offered
himself
for
a
boy
wages
here
he
was
found
too
weak
here
too
old
here
his
imperfect
english
was
in
the
way
here
his
jewish
appearance
he
had
a
few
short
terms
of
work
at
this
or
that
i
do
not
know
the
name
of
the
form
of
drudgery
that
my
father
did
not
practise
but
all
told
he
did
not
earn
enough
to
pay
the
rent
in
full
and
buy
a
bone
for
the
soup
the
only
steady
source
of
income
for
i
do
not
know
what
years
was
my
brother
earnings
from
his
newspapers
surely
this
was
the
time
for
me
to
take
my
sister
place
in
the
workshop
i
had
had
every
fair
chance
until
now
school
my
time
to
myself
liberty
to
run
and
play
and
make
friends
i
had
graduated
from
grammar
school
i
was
of
legal
age
to
go
to
work
what
was
i
doing
sitting
at
home
and
dreaming
i
was
minding
my
business
of
course
with
all
my
might
i
was
minding
my
business
as
i
understood
it
my
business
was
to
go
to
school
to
learn
everything
there
was
to
know
to
write
poetry
become
famous
and
make
the
family
rich
surely
it
was
not
shirking
to
lay
out
such
a
programme
for
myself
i
had
boundless
faith
in
my
future
i
was
certainly
going
to
be
a
great
poet
i
was
certainly
going
to
take
care
of
the
family
thus
mused
i
in
my
arrogance
and
my
family
they
were
as
bad
as
i
my
father
had
not
lost
a
whit
of
his
ambition
for
me
since
graduation
day
and
the
speech
and
half
a
column
about
me
in
the
paper
his
ambition
had
soared
even
higher
he
was
going
to
keep
me
at
school
till
i
was
prepared
for
college
by
that
time
he
was
sure
i
would
more
than
take
care
of
myself
it
never
for
a
moment
entered
his
head
to
doubt
the
wisdom
or
justice
of
this
course
and
my
mother
was
just
as
loyal
to
my
cause
and
my
brother
and
my
sister
it
is
no
wonder
if
i
got
along
rapidly
i
was
helped
encouraged
and
upheld
by
every
one
even
the
baby
cheered
me
on
when
i
asked
her
whether
she
believed
in
higher
education
she
answered
without
a
moment
hesitation
against
her
i
remember
only
that
one
day
when
i
read
her
a
verse
out
of
a
most
pathetic
piece
i
was
composing
she
laughed
right
out
a
most
disrespectful
laugh
for
which
i
revenged
myself
by
washing
her
face
at
the
faucet
and
rubbing
it
red
on
the
roller
towel
it
was
just
like
me
when
it
was
debated
whether
i
would
be
best
fitted
for
college
at
the
high
or
the
latin
school
to
go
in
person
to
tetlow
who
was
principal
of
both
schools
and
so
get
the
most
expert
opinion
on
the
subject
i
never
send
a
messenger
you
may
remember
where
i
can
go
myself
it
was
vacation
time
and
i
had
to
find
tetlow
at
his
home
away
out
to
the
wilds
of
roxbury
i
found
my
way
perhaps
half
an
hour
ride
on
the
electric
car
from
dover
street
i
grew
an
inch
taller
and
broader
between
the
corner
of
cedar
street
and
tetlow
house
such
was
the
charm
of
the
clean
green
suburb
on
a
cramped
waif
from
the
slums
my
faded
calico
dress
my
rusty
straw
sailor
hat
the
color
of
my
skin
and
all
bespoke
the
waif
but
never
a
bit
daunted
was
i
went
up
the
steps
to
the
porch
rang
the
bell
and
asked
for
the
great
man
with
as
much
assurance
as
if
i
were
a
daily
visitor
on
cedar
street
i
calmly
awaited
the
appearance
of
tetlow
in
the
reception
room
and
stated
my
errand
without
trepidation
and
why
not
i
was
a
solemn
little
person
for
the
moment
earnestly
seeking
advice
on
a
matter
of
great
importance
that
is
what
tetlow
saw
to
judge
by
the
gravity
with
which
he
discussed
my
business
with
me
and
the
courtesy
with
which
he
showed
me
to
the
door
he
saw
too
i
fancy
that
i
was
not
the
least
bit
conscious
of
my
shabby
dress
and
i
am
sure
he
did
not
smile
at
my
appearance
even
when
my
back
was
turned
a
new
life
began
for
me
when
i
entered
the
latin
school
in
september
until
then
i
had
gone
to
school
with
my
equals
and
as
a
matter
of
course
now
it
was
distinctly
a
feat
for
me
to
keep
in
school
and
my
schoolmates
were
socially
so
far
superior
to
me
that
my
poverty
became
conspicuous
the
pupils
of
the
latin
school
from
the
nature
of
the
institution
are
an
aristocratic
set
they
come
from
refined
homes
dress
well
and
spend
the
recess
hour
talking
about
parties
beaux
and
the
matinée
as
students
they
are
either
very
quick
or
very
for
the
course
of
study
in
the
lingo
of
the
school
world
is
considered
stiff
the
girl
with
half
her
brain
asleep
or
with
too
many
beaux
drops
out
by
the
end
of
the
first
year
or
a
one
and
only
beau
may
be
the
fatal
element
at
the
end
of
the
course
the
weeding
process
has
reduced
the
once
numerous
tribe
of
academic
candidates
to
a
cosey
little
family
by
all
these
tokens
i
should
have
had
serious
business
on
my
hands
as
a
pupil
in
the
latin
school
but
i
did
not
find
it
hard
to
make
myself
in
my
lessons
required
long
hours
of
study
but
that
was
my
delight
to
make
myself
at
home
in
an
alien
world
was
also
within
my
talents
i
had
been
practising
it
day
and
night
for
the
past
four
years
to
remain
unconscious
of
my
shabby
and
clothes
when
the
rustle
of
silk
petticoats
in
the
schoolroom
protested
against
them
was
a
matter
still
within
my
moral
reach
half
a
dress
a
year
had
been
my
allowance
for
many
seasons
even
less
for
as
i
did
not
grow
much
i
could
wear
my
dresses
as
long
as
they
lasted
and
i
had
stood
before
editors
and
exchanged
polite
calls
with
untroubled
by
the
detestable
colors
and
archaic
design
of
my
garments
to
stand
up
and
recite
latin
declensions
without
trembling
from
hunger
was
something
more
of
a
feat
because
i
sometimes
went
to
school
with
little
or
no
breakfast
but
even
that
required
no
special
heroism
at
most
it
was
a
matter
of
i
had
the
advantage
of
a
poor
appetite
too
i
really
did
not
need
much
breakfast
or
if
i
was
hungry
it
would
hardly
show
i
coughed
so
much
that
my
unsteadiness
was
everything
helped
you
see
my
schoolmates
helped
aristocrats
though
they
were
they
did
not
hold
themselves
aloof
from
me
some
of
the
girls
who
came
to
school
in
carriages
were
especially
cordial
they
rated
me
by
my
scholarship
and
not
by
my
father
occupation
they
teased
and
admired
me
by
turns
for
learning
the
footnotes
in
the
latin
grammar
by
heart
they
never
reproached
me
for
my
ignorance
of
the
latest
comic
opera
and
it
was
more
than
good
breeding
that
made
them
seem
unaware
of
the
incongruity
of
my
presence
it
was
a
generous
appreciation
of
what
it
meant
for
a
girl
from
the
slums
to
be
in
the
latin
school
on
the
way
to
college
if
our
intimacy
ended
on
the
steps
of
the
it
was
more
my
fault
than
theirs
most
of
the
girls
were
democratic
enough
to
have
invited
me
to
their
homes
although
to
some
of
course
i
was
impossible
but
i
had
no
time
for
visiting
school
work
and
reading
and
family
affairs
occupied
all
the
daytime
and
much
of
the
night
time
i
did
not
go
with
any
of
the
girls
in
the
sense
of
the
phrase
i
admired
some
of
them
either
for
good
looks
or
beautiful
manners
or
more
subtle
attributes
but
always
at
a
distance
i
discovered
something
inimitable
in
the
way
the
back
bay
girls
carried
themselves
and
i
should
have
been
the
first
to
perceive
the
incongruity
of
commonwealth
avenue
entwining
arms
with
dover
street
some
day
perhaps
when
i
should
be
famous
and
rich
but
not
just
then
so
my
companions
and
i
parted
on
the
steps
of
the
in
mutual
respect
they
guiltless
of
snobbishness
i
innocent
of
envy
it
was
a
graciously
american
relation
and
i
am
happy
to
this
day
to
recall
it
the
one
exception
to
this
rule
of
friendly
distance
was
my
chum
florence
connolly
but
i
should
hardly
have
said
chum
florence
and
i
occupied
adjacent
seats
for
three
years
but
we
did
not
walk
arm
in
arm
nor
call
each
other
nicknames
nor
share
our
lunch
nor
correspond
in
vacation
time
florence
was
quiet
as
a
mouse
and
i
was
reserved
as
an
oyster
and
perhaps
we
two
had
no
more
in
common
fundamentally
than
those
two
creatures
in
their
natural
state
still
as
we
were
both
very
studious
and
never
strayed
far
from
our
desks
at
recess
we
practised
a
sort
of
intimacy
of
propinquity
although
florence
was
of
my
social
order
her
father
presiding
over
a
cheap
lunch
room
i
did
not
on
that
account
feel
especially
drawn
to
her
i
spent
more
time
studying
florence
than
loving
her
i
suppose
and
yet
i
ought
to
have
loved
her
she
was
such
a
good
girl
always
perfect
in
her
lessons
she
was
so
modest
that
she
recited
in
a
noticeable
tremor
and
had
to
be
told
frequently
to
raise
her
voice
florence
wore
her
light
brown
hair
brushed
flatly
back
and
braided
in
a
single
plait
at
a
time
when
pompadours
were
six
inches
high
and
braids
hung
in
pairs
florence
had
a
pocket
in
her
dress
for
her
handkerchief
in
a
day
when
pockets
were
repugnant
to
fashion
all
these
things
ought
to
have
made
me
feel
the
kinship
of
humble
circumstances
the
comradeship
of
intellectual
earnestness
but
they
did
not
the
truth
is
that
my
relation
to
persons
and
things
depended
neither
on
social
distinctions
nor
on
intellectual
or
moral
affinities
my
attitude
at
this
time
was
determined
by
my
consciousness
of
the
unique
elements
in
my
character
and
history
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
been
pursuing
a
single
adventure
since
the
beginning
of
the
world
through
highways
and
byways
underground
overground
by
land
by
sea
ever
the
same
star
had
guided
me
i
thought
ever
the
same
purpose
had
divided
my
affairs
from
other
men
what
that
purpose
was
where
was
the
fixed
horizon
beyond
which
my
star
would
not
recede
was
an
absorbing
mystery
to
me
but
the
current
moment
never
puzzled
me
what
i
chose
instinctively
to
do
i
knew
to
be
right
and
in
accordance
with
my
destiny
i
never
hesitated
over
great
things
but
answered
promptly
to
the
call
of
my
genius
so
what
was
it
to
me
whether
my
neighbors
spurned
or
embraced
me
if
my
way
was
no
man
way
nor
should
any
one
ever
reject
me
whom
i
chose
to
be
my
friend
because
i
would
make
sure
of
a
kindred
spirit
by
the
coincidence
of
our
guiding
stars
when
where
in
the
life
of
dover
street
was
there
time
or
place
for
such
in
the
night
when
everybody
slept
on
a
solitary
walk
as
far
from
home
as
i
dared
to
go
i
was
not
unhappy
on
dover
street
quite
the
contrary
everything
of
consequence
was
well
with
me
poverty
was
a
superficial
temporary
matter
it
vanished
at
the
touch
of
money
money
in
america
was
plentiful
it
was
only
a
matter
of
getting
some
of
it
and
i
was
on
my
way
to
the
mint
if
dover
street
was
not
a
pleasant
place
to
abide
in
it
was
only
a
wayside
house
and
i
was
really
happy
actively
happy
in
the
exercise
of
my
mind
in
latin
mathematics
history
and
the
rest
the
things
that
suffice
a
studious
girl
in
the
middle
teens
still
i
had
moments
of
depression
when
my
whole
being
protested
against
the
life
of
the
slum
i
resented
the
familiarity
of
my
vulgar
neighbors
i
felt
myself
defiled
by
the
indecencies
i
was
compelled
to
witness
then
it
was
i
took
to
running
away
from
home
i
went
out
in
the
twilight
and
walked
for
hours
my
blind
feet
leading
me
i
did
not
care
where
i
went
if
i
lost
my
way
so
much
the
better
i
never
wanted
to
see
dover
street
again
but
behold
as
i
left
the
crowds
behind
and
the
broader
avenues
were
spanned
by
the
open
sky
my
grievances
melted
away
and
i
fell
to
dreaming
of
things
that
neither
hurt
nor
pleased
a
fringe
of
trees
against
the
sunset
became
suddenly
the
symbol
of
the
whole
world
and
i
stood
and
gazed
and
asked
questions
of
it
the
sunset
faded
the
trees
withdrew
the
wind
went
by
but
dropped
no
hint
in
my
ear
the
evening
star
leaped
out
between
the
clouds
and
sealed
the
secret
with
a
seal
of
splendor
a
favorite
resort
of
mine
after
dark
was
the
south
boston
bridge
across
south
bay
and
the
old
colony
railroad
this
was
so
near
home
that
i
could
go
there
at
any
time
when
the
confusion
in
the
house
drove
me
out
or
i
felt
the
need
of
fresh
air
i
liked
to
stand
leaning
on
the
bridge
railing
and
look
down
on
the
dim
tangle
of
railroad
tracks
below
i
could
barely
see
them
branching
out
elbowing
winding
and
sliding
out
into
the
night
in
pairs
i
was
fascinated
by
the
dotted
lights
the
significant
red
and
green
of
signal
lamps
these
simple
things
stood
for
a
complexity
that
it
made
me
dizzy
to
think
of
then
the
blackness
below
me
was
split
by
the
fiery
eye
of
a
monster
engine
his
breath
enveloped
me
in
blinding
clouds
his
long
body
shot
by
rattling
a
hundred
claws
of
steel
and
he
was
gone
with
an
imperative
shriek
that
shook
me
where
i
stood
so
would
i
be
swift
on
my
rightful
business
picking
out
my
proper
track
from
the
million
that
cross
it
pausing
for
no
obstacles
sure
of
my
goal
illustration
i
liked
to
stand
and
look
down
on
the
dim
tangle
of
railroad
tracks
below
after
my
watches
on
the
bridge
i
often
stayed
up
to
write
or
study
it
is
late
before
dover
street
begins
to
go
to
bed
it
is
past
midnight
before
i
feel
that
i
am
alone
seated
in
my
stiff
little
chair
before
my
narrow
table
i
gather
in
the
night
sounds
through
the
open
window
curious
to
assort
and
define
them
as
little
by
little
the
city
settles
down
to
sleep
the
volume
of
sound
diminishes
and
the
qualities
of
particular
sounds
stand
out
the
electric
car
lurches
by
with
silent
gong
taking
the
empty
track
by
leaps
humming
to
itself
in
the
invisible
distance
a
benighted
team
swings
recklessly
around
the
corner
sharp
under
my
rattling
window
panes
the
staccato
pelting
of
hoofs
on
the
cobblestones
changed
suddenly
to
an
even
pounding
on
the
bridge
a
few
pedestrians
hurry
by
their
heavy
boots
all
out
of
step
the
distant
thoroughfares
have
long
ago
ceased
their
murmur
and
i
know
that
a
million
lamps
shine
idly
in
the
idle
streets
my
sister
sleeps
quietly
in
the
little
bed
the
rhythmic
dripping
of
a
faucet
is
audible
through
the
flat
it
is
so
still
that
i
can
hear
the
paper
crackling
on
the
wall
silence
upon
silence
is
added
to
the
night
only
the
kitchen
clock
is
the
voice
of
my
brooding
thoughts
ticking
ticking
ticking
suddenly
the
distant
whistle
of
a
locomotive
breaks
the
stillness
with
a
wail
like
a
threatened
trouble
the
sound
comes
nearer
piercingly
near
then
it
dies
out
in
a
mangled
silence
complaining
to
the
last
the
sleepers
stir
in
their
beds
somebody
sighs
and
the
burden
of
all
his
trouble
falls
upon
my
heart
a
homeless
cat
cries
in
the
alley
in
the
voice
of
a
human
child
and
the
ticking
of
the
kitchen
clock
is
the
voice
of
my
troubled
thoughts
many
things
are
revealed
to
me
as
i
sit
and
watch
the
world
asleep
but
the
silence
asks
me
many
questions
that
i
can
not
answer
and
i
am
glad
when
the
tide
of
sound
begins
to
return
by
little
and
little
and
i
welcome
the
clatter
of
tin
cans
that
announces
the
milkman
i
can
not
see
him
in
the
dusk
but
i
know
his
wholesome
face
has
no
problem
in
it
it
is
one
flight
up
to
the
roof
it
is
a
leap
of
the
soul
to
the
sunrise
the
morning
mist
rests
lightly
on
chimneys
and
roofs
and
walls
wreathes
the
and
floats
in
gauzy
streamers
down
the
streets
distant
buildings
are
massed
like
palace
walls
with
turrets
and
spires
lost
in
the
rosy
clouds
i
love
my
beautiful
city
spreading
all
about
me
i
love
the
world
i
love
my
place
in
the
world
chapter
xvii
the
landlady
from
sunrise
to
sunset
the
day
was
long
enough
for
many
things
besides
school
which
occupied
five
hours
there
was
time
for
me
to
try
to
earn
my
living
or
at
least
the
rent
of
our
tenement
rent
was
a
standing
trouble
we
were
always
behind
and
the
landlady
was
very
angry
so
i
was
particularly
ambitious
to
earn
the
rent
i
had
had
one
or
two
poems
published
since
the
celebrated
eulogy
of
george
washington
but
nobody
had
paid
for
my
poems
yet
i
was
coming
to
that
of
course
but
in
the
mean
time
i
could
not
pay
the
rent
with
my
writing
to
be
sure
my
acquaintance
with
men
of
letters
gave
me
an
opening
a
friend
of
mine
introduced
me
to
a
slightly
literary
lady
who
introduced
me
to
the
editor
of
the
boston
searchlight
who
offered
me
a
generous
commission
for
subscriptions
to
his
paper
if
our
rent
was
three
and
dollars
per
week
payable
on
strong
demand
and
the
annual
subscription
to
the
searchlight
was
one
dollar
and
my
commission
was
fifty
per
cent
how
many
subscribers
did
i
need
how
easy
seven
subscribers
a
week
one
a
day
anybody
could
do
that
james
the
editor
said
so
he
said
i
could
get
two
or
three
any
afternoon
between
the
end
of
school
and
supper
if
i
worked
all
saturday
my
head
went
dizzy
computing
the
amount
of
my
commissions
it
would
be
rent
and
shoes
and
bonnets
and
everything
for
everybody
bright
and
early
one
saturday
morning
in
the
fall
i
started
out
canvassing
in
my
hand
a
neatly
folded
copy
of
the
searchlight
in
my
heart
faith
in
my
lucky
star
and
towards
all
the
world
i
began
with
one
of
the
great
office
buildings
on
tremont
street
as
james
had
advised
the
first
i
lost
wandering
through
the
corridors
reading
the
names
on
the
doors
there
were
so
many
people
in
the
same
office
how
should
i
know
when
i
entered
which
was
wilson
reed
solicitors
and
which
jenkins
smith
mortgages
and
bonds
i
decided
that
it
did
not
matter
i
would
call
them
all
sir
i
selected
a
door
and
knocked
after
waiting
some
time
i
knocked
a
little
louder
the
building
buzzed
with
noise
swift
footsteps
echoed
on
the
stone
floors
snappy
talk
broke
out
with
the
opening
of
every
door
bells
tinkled
elevators
hummed
no
wonder
they
did
not
hear
me
knock
but
i
noticed
that
other
people
went
in
without
knocking
so
after
a
while
i
did
the
same
there
were
several
men
and
two
women
in
the
small
brightly
lighted
room
they
were
all
busy
it
was
very
confusing
should
i
say
sir
to
the
roomful
excuse
me
sir
i
began
that
was
a
very
good
beginning
i
felt
sure
but
i
must
speak
louder
lately
my
voice
had
been
poor
in
school
gave
out
sometimes
in
the
middle
of
a
recitation
i
cleared
my
throat
but
i
did
not
repeat
myself
the
back
of
the
bald
head
that
i
had
addressed
revolved
and
presented
its
complement
a
bald
front
will
you
would
you
like
i
like
i
stared
in
dismay
at
the
bald
gentleman
unable
to
recall
a
word
of
what
i
meant
to
say
and
he
stared
in
impatience
at
me
well
well
he
snapped
what
is
it
what
is
it
that
reminded
me
it
the
searchlight
sir
i
take
sub
take
it
away
take
it
away
we
busy
here
he
waved
me
away
over
his
shoulder
the
back
of
his
head
once
more
presented
to
me
i
stole
out
of
the
room
in
great
confusion
was
that
the
way
i
was
going
to
be
received
why
james
had
said
nobody
would
hesitate
to
subscribe
it
was
the
best
paper
in
boston
the
searchlight
and
no
business
man
could
afford
to
be
without
it
i
must
have
made
some
blunder
mortgages
and
bonds
a
business
i
never
heard
of
it
and
very
likely
i
had
spoken
to
jenkins
smith
i
must
try
again
of
course
i
must
try
again
i
selected
a
real
estate
office
next
a
real
estate
broker
i
knew
for
certain
was
a
business
man
george
hooker
must
be
just
waiting
for
the
boston
searchlight
hooker
was
indeed
waiting
and
he
was
telling
central
about
it
yes
central
waiting
waiting
what
yes
yes
ring
that
since
when
why
did
you
say
so
at
first
then
instead
of
keeping
me
on
the
line
what
oh
is
that
so
well
never
mind
this
time
i
see
i
all
right
i
had
become
so
absorbed
in
this
monologue
that
when
hooker
swung
around
on
me
in
his
revolving
chair
i
was
startled
feeling
that
i
had
been
caught
eavesdropping
i
thought
he
was
going
to
rebuke
me
but
he
only
said
what
can
i
do
for
you
miss
encouraged
by
his
forbearance
i
said
would
you
like
to
subscribe
to
the
searchlight
sir
sir
was
safer
after
it
a
dollar
a
year
i
was
supposed
to
say
that
it
was
the
best
paper
in
boston
but
hooker
did
not
look
interested
though
he
was
not
cross
no
thank
you
miss
no
new
papers
for
me
excuse
me
i
am
very
busy
and
he
began
to
dictate
to
a
stenographer
well
that
was
not
so
bad
hooker
was
at
least
polite
i
must
try
to
make
a
better
speech
next
time
i
stuck
to
real
estate
now
kennedy
were
both
in
in
my
next
office
and
both
apparently
enjoying
a
minute
of
relaxation
tilted
back
in
their
chairs
behind
a
low
railing
said
i
determined
to
be
businesslike
at
last
and
addressing
myself
to
the
whole
firm
would
you
like
to
subscribe
to
the
searchlight
it
a
very
good
paper
no
business
man
can
afford
it
afford
to
be
without
it
i
mean
it
only
a
dollar
a
year
both
men
smiled
at
my
break
and
i
smiled
too
i
wondered
would
they
subscribe
separately
or
would
they
take
one
copy
for
the
firm
the
searchlight
repeated
one
of
the
partners
never
heard
of
it
is
that
the
paper
you
have
there
he
unfolded
the
paper
i
gave
him
looked
over
it
and
handed
it
to
his
partner
ever
heard
of
the
what
do
you
think
can
we
afford
to
be
without
it
i
guess
we
make
out
somehow
replied
handing
me
back
my
paper
but
i
buy
this
copy
of
you
miss
he
added
from
second
thoughts
and
i
go
partner
on
the
bargain
said
kennedy
but
i
objected
this
is
a
sample
i
said
i
do
sell
single
papers
i
take
subscriptions
for
the
year
it
one
dollar
and
no
business
man
can
afford
it
you
know
kennedy
winked
as
he
said
it
and
we
all
smiled
again
it
would
have
been
stupid
not
to
see
the
joke
i
sorry
i
ca
sell
my
sample
i
said
with
my
hand
on
the
doorknob
that
all
right
my
dear
said
kennedy
with
a
gracious
wave
of
the
hand
and
his
partner
called
after
me
better
luck
next
door
well
i
was
getting
on
the
people
grew
friendlier
all
the
time
but
i
skipped
next
door
it
was
mortgages
and
bonds
i
tried
insurance
the
best
paper
in
boston
is
it
remarked
thomas
dix
turning
over
my
sample
and
who
told
you
that
young
lady
james
was
my
prompt
reply
who
is
mr
james
the
oh
i
see
and
do
you
also
think
the
the
best
paper
in
boston
i
do
know
sir
i
like
the
much
better
and
the
at
that
dix
laughed
that
right
he
said
business
is
business
but
you
tell
the
truth
one
dollar
is
it
here
you
are
my
name
is
on
the
door
i
think
i
spent
twenty
minutes
copying
the
name
and
room
number
from
the
door
i
did
not
trust
myself
to
read
plain
english
what
if
i
made
a
mistake
and
the
searchlight
went
astray
and
good
dix
remained
unilluminated
he
had
paid
for
the
year
it
would
be
dreadful
to
make
a
mistake
emboldened
by
my
one
success
i
went
into
the
next
office
without
considering
the
kind
of
business
announced
on
the
door
i
tried
brokers
lawyers
contractors
and
all
just
as
they
came
around
the
corridor
but
i
copied
no
more
addresses
most
of
the
people
were
polite
some
men
waved
me
away
like
jenkins
smith
some
looked
impatient
at
first
but
excused
themselves
politely
in
the
end
almost
everybody
said
we
busy
here
as
if
they
suspected
i
wanted
them
to
read
a
whole
year
issue
of
the
searchlight
at
once
at
last
one
man
told
me
he
did
not
think
it
was
a
nice
business
for
a
girl
going
through
the
offices
like
that
this
took
me
aback
i
had
not
thought
anything
about
the
nature
of
the
business
i
only
wanted
the
money
to
pay
the
rent
i
wandered
through
miles
of
stone
corridors
unable
to
see
why
it
was
not
a
nice
business
and
yet
reluctant
to
go
on
with
it
with
the
doubt
in
my
mind
intent
on
my
new
problem
i
walked
into
a
messenger
boy
and
looking
back
to
apologize
to
him
i
collided
softly
with
a
gentleman
getting
out
of
an
elevator
i
was
making
up
my
mind
to
leave
the
building
forever
when
i
saw
an
office
door
standing
open
it
was
the
first
open
door
i
had
come
across
since
morning
it
was
past
noon
now
and
it
was
a
sign
to
me
to
keep
on
i
must
not
give
up
so
easily
frederick
a
strong
was
alone
in
the
office
surreptitiously
picking
his
teeth
he
had
been
to
lunch
he
heard
me
out
how
much
is
your
commission
if
i
may
ask
it
was
the
first
thing
he
had
said
fifty
cents
sir
well
i
tell
you
what
i
will
do
i
do
care
to
subscribe
but
here
a
quarter
for
you
if
i
did
not
blush
it
was
because
it
is
not
my
habit
but
all
of
a
sudden
i
choked
a
lump
jumped
into
my
throat
almost
the
tears
were
in
my
eyes
that
man
was
right
who
said
it
was
not
nice
to
go
through
the
offices
i
was
taken
for
a
beggar
a
stranger
offered
me
money
for
nothing
i
could
not
say
a
word
i
started
to
go
out
but
strong
jumped
up
and
prevented
me
oh
do
go
like
that
he
cried
i
did
mean
to
offend
you
upon
my
word
i
did
i
beg
your
pardon
i
did
know
you
see
you
sit
down
a
minute
to
rest
that
kind
of
you
strong
was
so
genuinely
repentant
that
i
could
not
refuse
him
besides
i
felt
a
little
weak
i
had
been
on
my
feet
since
morning
and
had
had
no
lunch
i
sat
down
and
strong
talked
he
showed
me
a
picture
of
his
wife
and
little
girl
and
said
i
must
go
and
see
them
some
time
pretty
soon
i
was
chatting
too
and
i
told
strong
about
the
latin
school
and
of
course
he
asked
me
if
i
was
french
the
way
people
always
did
when
they
wanted
to
say
that
i
had
a
foreign
accent
so
we
got
started
on
russia
and
had
such
an
interesting
time
that
we
both
jumped
up
surprised
when
a
fine
young
lady
in
a
beautiful
hat
came
in
to
take
possession
of
the
idle
typewriter
strong
introduced
me
very
formally
thanked
me
for
an
interesting
hour
and
shook
hands
with
me
at
the
door
i
did
not
add
his
name
to
my
short
subscription
list
but
i
counted
it
a
greater
triumph
that
i
had
made
a
friend
it
would
have
been
seeking
an
anticlimax
to
solicit
any
more
in
the
building
i
went
out
into
the
roar
of
tremont
street
and
across
the
common
still
green
and
leafy
i
rested
a
while
on
a
bench
debating
where
to
go
next
it
was
past
two
by
the
clock
on
park
street
church
i
had
had
a
long
day
already
but
it
was
too
early
to
quit
work
with
only
one
half
dollar
of
my
own
in
my
pocket
it
was
saturday
in
the
evening
the
landlady
would
come
i
must
try
a
little
longer
i
went
out
along
columbus
avenue
a
popular
route
for
bicyclists
at
that
time
the
bicycle
stores
all
along
the
way
looked
promising
to
me
the
people
did
not
look
so
busy
as
in
the
office
building
they
would
at
least
be
polite
they
were
not
particularly
rude
but
they
did
not
subscribe
nobody
wanted
the
searchlight
they
had
never
heard
of
it
they
made
jokes
about
it
they
did
not
want
it
at
any
price
i
began
to
lose
faith
in
the
paper
myself
i
got
tired
of
its
name
i
began
to
feel
dizzy
i
stopped
going
into
the
stores
i
walked
straight
along
looking
at
nothing
i
wanted
to
go
back
go
home
but
i
would
i
felt
like
doing
myself
spite
i
walked
right
along
straight
as
the
avenue
ran
i
did
not
know
where
it
would
lead
me
i
did
not
care
everything
was
horrid
i
would
go
right
on
until
night
i
would
get
lost
i
would
fall
in
a
faint
on
a
strange
doorstep
and
be
found
dead
in
the
morning
and
be
pitied
would
that
be
interesting
the
adventure
might
even
end
happily
i
might
faint
at
the
door
of
a
rich
old
man
house
who
would
take
me
in
and
order
his
housekeeper
to
nurse
me
just
like
in
the
story
books
in
my
delirium
of
course
i
would
have
a
fever
i
would
talk
about
the
landlady
and
how
i
had
tried
to
earn
the
rent
and
the
old
gentleman
would
wipe
his
spectacles
for
pity
then
i
would
wake
up
and
ask
plaintively
where
am
i
and
when
i
got
strong
after
a
delightfully
long
convalescence
the
old
gentleman
would
take
me
to
dover
street
in
a
carriage
and
we
would
all
be
reunited
and
laugh
and
cry
together
the
old
gentleman
of
course
would
engage
my
father
as
his
steward
on
the
spot
and
we
would
all
go
to
live
in
one
of
his
houses
with
a
garden
around
it
i
walked
on
and
on
gleefully
aware
that
i
had
not
eaten
since
morning
was
i
beginning
to
feel
shaky
yes
i
should
certainly
faint
before
long
but
i
did
like
the
houses
i
passed
they
did
not
look
fit
for
my
adventure
i
must
keep
up
till
i
reached
a
better
neighborhood
anybody
who
knows
boston
knows
how
cheaply
my
adventure
ended
columbus
avenue
leads
out
to
roxbury
crossing
when
i
saw
that
the
houses
were
getting
shabbier
instead
of
finer
my
heart
sank
when
i
came
out
on
the
noisy
centre
my
spirit
collapsed
utterly
i
did
not
swoon
i
woke
up
from
my
foolish
childish
dream
with
a
shock
i
was
disgusted
with
myself
and
frightened
besides
it
was
evening
now
and
i
was
faint
and
sick
in
good
earnest
and
i
did
not
know
where
i
was
i
asked
a
starter
at
the
transfer
station
the
way
to
dover
street
and
he
told
me
to
get
on
a
car
that
was
just
coming
in
i
walk
i
said
if
you
will
please
tell
me
the
shortest
way
how
could
i
spend
five
cents
out
of
the
little
i
had
made
but
the
starter
discouraged
me
you
ca
walk
it
before
midnight
the
way
you
look
my
girl
better
hop
on
that
car
before
it
goes
i
could
not
resist
the
temptation
i
rode
home
in
the
car
and
felt
like
a
thief
when
i
paid
the
fare
five
cents
gone
to
pay
for
my
folly
i
was
grateful
for
a
cold
supper
thrice
grateful
to
hear
that
hutch
the
landlady
had
been
and
gone
content
with
two
dollars
that
my
father
had
brought
home
hutch
seldom
succeeded
in
collecting
the
full
amount
of
the
rents
from
her
tenants
i
suppose
that
made
the
bookkeeping
complicated
which
must
have
been
wearing
on
her
nerves
and
hence
her
temper
we
lived
on
dover
street
in
fear
of
her
temper
saturday
had
a
distinct
quality
about
it
derived
from
the
imminence
of
hutch
visit
of
course
i
awoke
on
saturday
morning
with
the
feeling
but
the
grim
thing
that
leaped
to
its
feet
and
glowered
down
on
me
while
the
rest
of
my
consciousness
was
still
yawning
on
its
back
was
the
feeling
it
is
hard
if
you
are
a
young
girl
full
of
life
and
inclined
to
be
glad
to
go
to
sleep
in
anxiety
and
awake
in
fear
it
is
apt
to
interfere
with
the
circulation
of
the
vital
ether
of
happiness
in
the
young
which
is
damaging
to
the
complexion
of
the
soul
it
is
bitter
when
you
are
and
unsuccessful
to
go
to
sleep
in
and
awake
unexonerated
it
is
likely
to
cause
fermentation
in
the
sweetest
nature
it
is
certain
to
breed
gray
hairs
and
a
premature
longing
for
death
it
is
pitiful
if
you
are
the
mother
of
an
impoverished
family
to
drop
in
your
traces
helpless
at
night
and
awake
unstrengthened
in
the
early
morning
the
haunting
consciousness
of
rooted
poverty
is
an
improper
bedfellow
for
a
woman
who
still
bears
it
has
been
known
to
induce
physical
and
spiritual
malformations
in
the
babies
she
nurses
it
did
require
strength
to
lift
the
burden
of
life
in
the
gray
morning
on
dover
street
especially
on
saturday
morning
perhaps
my
mother
pack
was
the
heaviest
to
lift
to
the
man
of
the
house
poverty
is
a
bulky
dragon
with
gripping
talons
and
a
poisonous
breath
but
he
bellows
in
the
open
and
it
is
possible
to
give
him
knightly
battle
with
the
full
swing
of
the
angry
arm
that
cuts
to
the
vitals
to
the
housewife
want
is
an
insidious
myriapod
creature
that
crawls
in
the
dark
mates
with
its
own
offspring
breeds
all
the
year
round
persists
like
leprosy
the
woman
has
an
endless
inglorious
struggle
with
the
pest
her
triumphs
are
too
petty
for
applause
her
failures
too
mean
for
notice
care
to
the
man
is
a
hound
to
be
kept
in
leash
and
mastered
to
the
woman
care
is
a
secret
parasite
that
infects
the
blood
hutch
of
course
was
only
one
symptom
of
the
disease
of
poverty
but
there
were
times
when
she
seemed
to
me
the
sharpest
tooth
of
the
gnawing
canker
surely
as
sorrow
trails
behind
sin
saturday
evening
brought
hutch
the
landlady
did
not
trail
her
movements
were
anything
but
impassive
she
climbed
the
stairs
with
determination
and
landed
at
the
top
with
emphasis
her
knock
on
the
door
was
clear
sharp
unfaltering
it
was
impossible
to
pretend
not
to
hear
it
her
announced
business
her
manner
of
taking
a
chair
suggested
the
of
the
gauntlet
invariably
she
asked
for
my
father
calling
him
anton
and
refusing
to
be
corrected
almost
invariably
he
was
not
at
home
was
out
looking
for
work
had
he
left
her
the
rent
my
mother
gentle
no
was
the
signal
for
the
storm
i
do
not
want
to
repeat
what
hutch
said
it
would
be
hard
on
her
and
hard
on
me
she
grew
red
in
the
face
her
voice
grew
shriller
with
every
word
my
poor
mother
hung
her
head
where
she
stood
the
children
stared
from
their
corners
the
frightened
baby
cried
the
angry
landlady
rehearsed
our
sins
like
a
prophet
foretelling
doom
we
owed
so
many
weeks
rent
we
were
too
lazy
to
work
we
never
intended
to
pay
we
lived
on
others
we
deserved
to
be
put
out
without
warning
she
reproached
my
mother
for
having
too
many
children
she
blamed
us
all
for
coming
to
america
she
enumerated
her
losses
through
nonpayment
of
her
rents
told
us
that
she
did
not
collect
the
amount
of
her
taxes
showed
us
how
our
irregularities
were
driving
a
poor
widow
to
ruin
my
mother
did
not
attempt
to
excuse
herself
but
when
hutch
began
to
rail
against
my
absent
father
she
tried
to
put
in
a
word
in
his
defence
the
landlady
grew
all
the
shriller
at
that
and
silenced
my
mother
impatiently
sometimes
she
addressed
herself
to
me
i
always
stood
by
if
i
was
at
home
to
give
my
mother
the
moral
support
of
my
dumb
sympathy
i
understood
that
hutch
had
a
special
grudge
against
me
because
i
did
not
go
to
work
as
a
cash
girl
and
earn
three
dollars
a
week
i
wanted
to
explain
to
her
how
i
was
preparing
myself
for
a
great
career
and
i
was
ready
to
promise
her
the
payment
of
the
arrears
as
soon
as
i
began
to
get
rich
but
the
landlady
would
not
let
me
put
in
a
word
and
i
was
sorry
for
her
because
she
seemed
to
be
having
such
a
bad
time
at
last
hutch
got
up
to
leave
marching
out
as
determinedly
as
she
had
marched
in
at
the
door
she
turned
in
undiminished
wrath
to
shoot
her
parting
dart
and
if
anton
does
not
bring
me
the
rent
on
monday
i
will
serve
notice
of
eviction
on
tuesday
without
fail
we
breathed
when
she
was
gone
my
mother
wiped
away
a
few
tears
and
went
to
the
baby
crying
in
the
windowless
room
i
was
the
first
to
speak
is
she
queer
mamma
i
said
she
never
remembers
how
to
say
our
name
she
insists
on
saying
celia
say
and
i
made
the
baby
laugh
by
imitating
the
landlady
who
had
made
her
cry
but
when
i
went
to
my
little
room
i
did
not
mock
hutch
i
thought
about
her
thought
long
and
hard
and
to
a
purpose
i
decided
that
she
must
hear
me
out
once
she
must
understand
about
my
plans
my
future
my
good
intentions
it
was
too
irrational
to
go
on
like
this
we
living
in
fear
of
her
she
in
distrust
of
us
if
hutch
would
only
trust
me
and
the
tax
collectors
would
trust
her
we
could
all
live
happily
forever
i
was
the
more
certain
that
my
argument
would
prevail
with
the
landlady
if
only
i
could
make
her
listen
because
i
understood
her
point
of
view
i
even
sympathized
with
her
what
she
said
about
the
babies
for
instance
was
not
all
unreasonable
to
me
there
was
this
last
baby
my
mother
sixth
born
on
hutch
premises
yes
in
the
windowless
bedroom
was
there
any
need
of
this
baby
when
may
was
born
two
years
earlier
on
wheeler
street
i
had
accepted
her
after
a
while
i
even
welcomed
her
she
was
born
an
american
and
it
was
something
to
me
to
have
one
genuine
american
relative
i
had
to
sit
up
with
her
the
whole
of
her
first
night
on
earth
and
i
questioned
her
about
the
place
she
came
from
and
so
we
got
acquainted
as
my
mother
was
so
ill
that
my
sister
frieda
who
was
nurse
and
the
doctor
from
the
dispensary
had
all
they
could
do
to
take
care
of
her
the
baby
remained
in
my
charge
a
good
deal
and
so
i
got
used
to
her
but
when
celia
came
i
was
two
years
older
and
my
outlook
was
broader
i
could
see
around
a
baby
charms
and
discern
the
disadvantages
of
possessing
the
baby
i
was
supplied
with
all
kinds
of
relatives
now
i
had
a
and
an
nephew
who
might
become
a
president
moreover
i
knew
there
was
not
enough
to
eat
before
the
baby
advent
and
she
did
not
bring
any
supplies
with
her
that
i
could
see
the
baby
was
one
too
many
there
was
no
need
of
her
i
resented
her
existence
i
recorded
my
resentment
in
my
journal
i
was
pleased
with
my
that
enabled
me
to
see
all
sides
of
the
baby
question
i
could
regard
even
the
rent
question
disinterestedly
like
a
philosopher
reviewing
natural
phenomena
it
seemed
not
unreasonable
that
hutch
should
have
a
craving
for
the
rent
as
such
a
dotes
on
her
books
a
baby
cries
for
its
rattle
and
a
landlady
yearns
for
her
rents
i
could
easily
believe
that
it
was
doing
hutch
spiritual
violence
to
withhold
the
rent
from
her
and
hence
the
vehemence
with
which
she
pursued
the
arrears
yes
i
could
analyze
the
landlady
very
nicely
i
was
certainly
qualified
to
act
as
peacemaker
between
her
and
my
family
but
i
must
go
to
her
own
house
and
on
a
rent
day
saturday
evening
when
she
was
embittered
by
many
disappointments
was
no
time
to
approach
her
with
diplomatic
negotiations
i
must
go
to
her
house
on
a
day
of
good
omen
and
i
went
as
soon
as
my
father
could
give
me
a
week
rent
to
take
along
i
found
hutch
in
the
gloom
of
a
long
faded
parlor
divested
of
the
ample
black
coat
and
widow
bonnet
in
which
i
had
always
seen
her
her
presence
would
have
been
less
formidable
had
i
not
been
conscious
that
i
was
a
mere
rumpled
sparrow
fallen
into
the
lion
den
when
i
had
delivered
the
money
i
should
have
begun
my
speech
but
i
did
not
know
what
came
first
of
all
there
was
to
say
while
i
hesitated
hutch
observed
me
she
noticed
my
books
and
asked
about
them
i
thought
this
was
my
opening
and
i
showed
her
eagerly
my
latin
grammar
my
geometry
my
virgil
i
began
to
tell
her
how
i
was
to
go
to
college
to
fit
myself
to
write
poetry
and
get
rich
and
pay
the
arrears
but
hutch
cut
me
short
at
the
mention
of
college
she
broke
out
with
her
old
reproaches
and
worked
herself
into
a
worse
fury
than
i
had
ever
witnessed
before
i
was
all
alone
in
the
tempest
and
a
very
old
lady
was
sitting
on
a
sofa
drinking
tea
and
the
tidy
on
the
back
of
the
sofa
was
sliding
down
i
was
so
bewildered
by
the
suddenness
of
the
onslaught
i
felt
so
helpless
to
defend
myself
that
i
could
only
stand
and
stare
at
hutch
she
kept
on
railing
without
stopping
for
breath
repeating
herself
over
and
over
at
last
i
ceased
to
hear
what
she
said
i
became
hypnotized
by
the
rapid
motions
of
her
mouth
then
the
moving
tidy
caught
my
eye
and
the
spell
was
broken
i
went
over
to
the
sofa
with
a
decided
step
and
carefully
replaced
the
tidy
it
was
now
the
landlady
turn
to
stare
and
i
stared
back
surprised
at
my
own
action
the
old
lady
also
stared
her
teacup
suspended
under
her
nose
the
whole
thing
was
so
ridiculous
i
had
come
on
such
a
grand
mission
ready
to
dictate
the
terms
of
a
noble
peace
i
was
met
with
anger
and
contumely
the
dignity
of
the
ambassador
of
peace
rubbed
off
at
a
touch
like
the
golden
dust
from
the
butterfly
wing
i
took
my
scolding
like
a
meek
child
and
then
when
she
was
in
the
middle
of
a
trenchant
phrase
her
eye
fixed
daggerlike
on
mine
i
calmly
went
to
put
the
enemy
house
in
order
it
was
ridiculous
and
i
laughed
immediately
i
was
sorry
i
wanted
to
apologize
but
hutch
give
me
a
chance
if
she
had
been
harsh
before
she
was
terrific
now
did
i
come
there
to
insult
her
she
wanted
to
know
was
it
enough
that
i
and
my
family
lived
on
her
that
i
must
come
to
her
on
purpose
to
rile
her
with
my
talk
about
college
these
beggars
and
laugh
in
her
face
what
did
you
come
for
who
sent
you
why
do
you
stand
there
staring
say
something
these
beggars
and
do
you
think
i
keep
you
till
you
go
to
college
learning
geometry
did
you
ever
figure
out
how
much
rent
your
father
owes
me
you
are
all
too
lazy
do
say
a
word
do
speak
to
me
coming
here
to
laugh
in
my
face
i
do
believe
you
can
say
one
sensible
word
and
oh
these
beggars
you
ought
to
go
to
work
if
you
know
enough
to
do
one
sensible
thing
go
home
and
tell
your
father
never
to
send
you
again
laughing
in
my
face
and
staring
why
do
you
say
something
how
old
are
you
hutch
actually
stopped
and
i
jumped
into
the
pause
i
seventeen
i
said
quickly
and
i
feel
like
seventy
this
was
too
much
even
for
me
who
had
spoken
i
had
not
meant
to
say
the
last
it
broke
out
like
my
wicked
laugh
i
was
afraid
if
i
stayed
any
longer
hutch
would
have
the
apoplexy
and
i
felt
that
i
was
going
to
cry
i
moved
towards
the
door
but
the
landlady
got
in
another
speech
before
i
had
escaped
seventeen
seventy
and
looks
like
twelve
the
child
is
silly
even
tell
her
own
age
no
wonder
with
her
latin
and
french
and
i
did
cry
when
i
got
outside
and
i
did
care
if
i
was
noticed
what
was
the
use
of
anything
everything
i
did
was
wrong
everything
i
tried
to
do
for
hutch
turned
out
bad
i
tried
to
sell
papers
for
the
sake
of
the
rent
and
nobody
wanted
the
searchlight
and
i
was
told
it
was
not
a
nice
business
i
wanted
to
take
her
into
my
confidence
and
she
would
hear
a
word
but
scolded
and
called
me
names
she
was
an
unreasonable
ungrateful
landlady
i
wished
she
put
us
out
then
we
should
be
rid
of
but
was
it
funny
about
that
tidy
what
made
me
do
that
i
never
meant
to
curious
the
way
we
sometimes
do
things
we
do
want
to
at
the
old
lady
must
be
deaf
she
did
say
anything
all
that
oh
i
have
a
whole
book
of
the
æneid
to
review
and
it
getting
late
i
must
hurry
home
it
was
impossible
to
remain
despondent
long
the
landlady
came
only
once
a
week
i
reflected
as
i
walked
and
the
rest
of
the
time
i
was
surrounded
by
friends
everybody
was
good
to
me
at
home
of
course
and
at
school
and
there
was
miss
dillingham
and
her
friend
who
took
me
out
in
the
country
to
see
the
autumn
leaves
and
her
friend
who
lent
me
books
and
hurd
who
put
my
poems
in
the
transcript
and
gave
me
books
almost
every
time
i
came
and
a
dozen
others
who
did
something
good
for
me
all
the
time
besides
the
several
dozen
who
wrote
me
such
nice
letters
friends
if
i
named
one
for
every
block
i
passed
i
should
not
get
through
before
i
reached
home
there
was
strong
too
and
he
wanted
me
to
meet
his
wife
and
little
girl
and
pastor
i
had
almost
forgotten
pastor
i
arrived
at
the
corner
of
washington
and
dover
streets
on
my
way
home
and
looked
into
pastor
showy
drug
store
as
i
passed
and
that
reminded
me
of
the
history
of
my
latest
friendship
my
cough
had
been
pretty
bad
kept
me
awake
nights
my
voice
gave
out
frequently
the
teachers
had
spoken
to
me
several
times
suggesting
that
i
ought
to
see
a
doctor
of
course
the
teachers
did
not
know
that
i
could
not
afford
a
doctor
but
i
could
go
to
the
free
dispensary
and
i
did
they
told
me
to
come
again
and
again
and
i
lost
precious
hours
sitting
in
the
watching
for
my
turn
i
was
examined
thumped
studied
and
sent
out
with
prescriptions
and
innumerable
directions
all
that
was
said
about
food
fresh
air
sunny
rooms
was
of
course
impossible
but
i
would
try
the
medicine
a
bottle
of
medicine
was
a
definite
thing
with
a
fixed
price
you
either
could
or
could
not
afford
it
on
a
given
day
once
you
began
with
milk
and
eggs
and
such
things
there
was
no
end
of
it
you
were
always
going
around
the
corner
for
more
till
the
grocer
said
he
could
give
no
more
credit
no
the
medicine
bottle
was
the
only
safe
thing
i
had
taken
several
bottles
and
was
told
that
i
was
looking
better
when
i
went
one
day
to
have
my
prescription
renewed
it
was
just
after
a
hard
rain
and
the
pools
on
the
broken
pavements
were
full
of
blue
sky
i
was
delighted
with
the
beautiful
reflections
there
were
even
the
white
clouds
moving
across
the
blue
there
at
my
feet
on
the
pavement
i
walked
with
my
head
down
all
the
way
to
the
drug
store
which
was
all
right
but
i
should
not
have
done
it
going
back
with
the
new
bottle
of
medicine
in
my
hand
in
front
of
a
cigar
store
halfway
between
washington
street
and
harrison
avenue
stood
a
wooden
indian
with
a
package
of
wooden
cigars
in
his
hand
my
eyes
on
the
shining
rain
pools
i
walked
plump
into
the
indian
and
the
bottle
was
knocked
out
of
my
hand
and
broke
with
a
crash
i
was
horrified
at
the
catastrophe
the
medicine
cost
fifty
cents
my
mother
had
given
me
the
last
money
in
the
house
i
must
not
be
without
my
medicine
the
dispensary
doctor
was
very
emphatic
about
that
it
would
be
dreadful
to
get
sick
and
have
to
stay
out
of
school
what
was
to
be
done
i
made
up
my
mind
in
less
than
five
minutes
i
went
back
to
the
drug
store
and
asked
for
pastor
himself
he
knew
me
he
often
sold
me
postage
stamps
and
joked
about
my
large
correspondence
and
heard
a
good
deal
about
my
friends
he
came
out
on
this
occasion
from
his
little
office
in
the
back
of
the
store
and
i
told
him
of
my
accident
and
that
there
was
no
more
money
at
home
and
asked
him
to
give
me
another
bottle
to
be
paid
for
as
soon
as
possible
my
father
had
a
job
as
night
watchman
in
a
store
i
should
be
able
to
pay
very
soon
certainly
my
dear
certainly
said
pastor
very
glad
to
oblige
you
it
doing
you
good
is
it
that
right
you
such
a
studious
young
lady
with
all
those
books
and
so
many
letters
to
write
you
need
something
to
build
you
up
there
you
oh
mention
it
any
time
at
all
and
lookout
for
wild
indians
of
course
we
were
great
friends
after
that
and
this
is
the
way
my
troubles
often
ended
on
dover
street
to
bump
into
a
wooden
indian
was
to
bump
into
good
luck
a
hundred
times
a
week
no
wonder
i
was
happy
most
of
the
time
chapter
xviii
the
burning
bush
just
when
hutch
was
most
worried
about
the
error
of
my
ways
i
entered
on
a
new
chapter
of
adventures
even
more
remote
from
the
cash
girl
career
than
latin
and
geometry
but
i
ought
not
to
name
such
harsh
things
as
landladies
at
the
opening
of
the
fairy
story
of
my
girlhood
i
have
reached
what
was
the
second
transformation
of
my
life
as
truly
as
my
coming
to
america
was
the
first
great
transformation
robert
louis
stevenson
in
one
of
his
delightful
essays
credits
the
lover
with
a
feeling
of
remorse
and
shame
at
the
contemplation
of
that
part
of
his
life
which
he
lived
without
his
beloved
content
with
his
barren
existence
it
is
with
just
such
a
feeling
of
remorse
that
i
look
back
to
my
bookworm
days
before
i
began
the
study
of
natural
history
outdoors
and
with
a
feeling
of
shame
akin
to
the
lover
i
confess
how
late
in
my
life
nature
took
the
first
place
in
my
affections
the
subject
of
nature
study
is
better
developed
in
the
public
schools
than
it
was
in
my
time
i
remember
my
teacher
in
the
chelsea
grammar
school
who
encouraged
us
to
look
for
different
kinds
of
grasses
in
the
empty
lots
near
home
and
to
bring
to
school
samples
of
the
cereals
we
found
in
our
mothers
pantries
i
brought
the
grasses
and
cereals
as
i
did
everything
the
teacher
ordered
but
i
was
content
when
nature
study
was
over
and
the
arithmetic
lesson
began
i
was
not
interested
and
the
teacher
did
not
make
it
interesting
in
the
boys
books
i
was
fond
of
reading
i
came
across
all
sorts
of
heroes
and
i
sympathized
with
them
all
the
boy
who
ran
away
to
sea
the
boy
who
delighted
in
the
society
of
ranchmen
and
cowboys
the
boy
whose
ambition
was
to
drive
a
pasteboard
chariot
in
a
circus
the
boy
who
gave
up
his
holidays
in
order
to
earn
money
for
books
the
bad
boy
who
played
tricks
on
people
the
clever
boy
who
invented
amusing
toys
for
his
blind
little
sister
all
these
boys
i
admired
i
could
put
myself
in
the
place
of
any
one
of
these
heroes
and
delight
in
their
delights
but
there
was
one
sort
of
hero
i
never
could
understand
and
that
was
the
boy
whose
favorite
reading
was
natural
history
who
kept
an
aquarium
collected
beetles
and
knew
all
about
a
man
by
the
name
of
agassiz
this
style
of
boy
always
had
a
seafaring
uncle
or
a
missionary
aunt
who
sent
him
all
sorts
of
queer
things
from
china
and
the
south
sea
islands
and
the
conversation
between
this
boy
and
the
seafaring
uncle
home
on
a
visit
i
was
perfectly
willing
to
skip
the
impossible
hero
usually
kept
snakes
in
a
box
in
the
barn
where
his
little
sister
was
fond
of
playing
with
her
little
friends
the
snakes
escaped
at
least
once
before
the
end
of
the
story
and
the
things
the
boy
said
to
the
frightened
little
girls
about
the
harmless
and
fascinating
qualities
of
snakes
was
something
i
had
no
patience
to
read
no
i
did
not
care
for
natural
history
i
would
read
about
travels
about
deserts
and
nameless
islands
and
strange
peoples
but
snakes
and
birds
and
minerals
and
butterflies
did
not
interest
me
in
the
least
i
visited
the
natural
history
museum
once
or
twice
because
it
was
my
way
to
enter
every
open
door
so
as
to
miss
nothing
that
was
free
to
the
public
but
the
curious
monsters
that
filled
the
glass
cases
and
adorned
the
walls
and
ceilings
failed
to
stir
my
imagination
and
the
slimy
things
that
floated
in
glass
vessels
were
too
horrid
for
a
second
glance
of
all
the
horrid
things
that
ever
passed
under
my
eyes
when
i
lifted
my
nose
from
my
book
spiders
were
the
worst
mice
were
bad
enough
and
so
were
flies
and
worms
and
june
bugs
but
spiders
were
absolutely
the
most
loathsome
creatures
i
knew
and
yet
it
was
the
spider
that
opened
my
eyes
to
the
wonders
of
nature
and
touched
my
girlish
happiness
with
the
hues
of
the
infinite
and
it
happened
at
hale
house
it
was
not
hale
though
it
might
have
been
who
showed
me
the
way
to
the
settlement
house
on
garland
street
which
bears
his
name
hale
house
is
situated
in
the
midst
of
the
labyrinth
of
narrow
streets
and
alleys
that
constitutes
the
slum
of
which
harrison
avenue
is
the
backbone
and
of
which
dover
street
is
a
member
bearing
in
mind
the
fact
that
there
are
almost
no
playgrounds
in
all
this
congested
district
you
will
understand
that
hale
house
has
plenty
of
work
on
its
hands
to
carry
a
little
sunshine
into
the
grimy
tenement
homes
the
beautiful
story
of
how
that
is
done
can
not
be
told
here
but
what
hale
house
did
for
me
i
may
not
omit
to
mention
it
was
my
brother
joseph
who
discovered
hale
house
he
started
a
debating
club
and
invited
his
chums
to
help
him
settle
the
problems
of
the
republic
on
sunday
afternoon
the
club
held
its
first
session
in
our
empty
parlor
on
dover
street
and
the
united
states
government
was
in
a
fair
way
to
be
put
on
a
sound
basis
at
last
when
the
numerous
babies
belonging
to
our
establishment
broke
up
the
meeting
leaving
the
administration
in
suspense
as
to
its
future
course
the
next
meeting
was
held
in
isaac
maslinsky
parlor
and
the
orators
were
beginning
to
jump
to
their
feet
and
shake
their
fists
at
each
other
in
excellent
parliamentary
form
when
maslinsky
sallied
in
to
smile
at
the
boys
excitement
but
at
the
sight
of
seven
pairs
of
boys
boots
scuffling
on
her
cherished
parlor
carpet
the
fringed
cover
of
the
centre
table
hanging
by
one
corner
and
the
plush
photograph
album
unceremoniously
laid
aside
indignation
took
the
place
of
good
humor
in
maslinsky
ample
bosom
and
she
ordered
the
boys
to
clear
out
threatening
ike
with
dire
vengeance
if
ever
again
he
ventured
to
enter
the
parlor
with
ungentle
purpose
on
the
following
sunday
harry
rubinstein
offered
the
club
the
hospitality
of
parlor
and
the
meeting
began
satisfactorily
the
subject
on
the
table
was
the
tariff
and
the
pros
and
antis
were
about
evenly
divided
congress
might
safely
have
taken
a
nap
with
the
hub
debating
club
to
handle
its
affairs
if
harry
rubinstein
big
brother
jake
had
not
interfered
he
came
out
of
the
kitchen
where
he
had
been
stuffing
the
baby
with
peanuts
and
stood
in
the
doorway
of
the
parlor
and
winked
at
the
dignified
chairman
the
chairman
turned
his
back
on
him
whereupon
jake
pelted
him
with
peanut
shells
he
mocked
the
speakers
and
called
them
kids
and
wanted
to
know
how
they
could
tell
the
tariff
from
a
sunstroke
anyhow
we
got
to
have
free
trade
he
mocked
pa
listen
to
the
kids
the
interests
of
the
american
laborer
listen
to
the
kids
pa
flesh
and
blood
could
not
bear
this
the
political
reformers
adjourned
indefinitely
and
the
club
was
in
danger
of
extinction
for
want
of
a
sheltering
roof
when
one
of
the
members
discovered
that
hale
house
on
garland
street
was
waiting
to
welcome
the
club
how
the
prospered
in
the
genial
atmosphere
of
the
settlement
house
how
from
a
little
club
it
grew
to
be
a
big
club
as
the
little
boys
became
young
men
how
joseph
and
isaac
and
harry
and
the
rest
won
prizes
in
public
debates
how
they
came
to
be
a
part
of
the
multiple
influence
for
good
that
issues
from
garland
street
all
this
is
a
piece
of
the
history
of
hale
house
whose
business
in
the
slums
is
to
mould
the
restless
children
on
the
street
corners
into
noble
men
and
women
i
brought
the
into
my
story
just
to
show
how
naturally
the
children
of
the
slums
drift
toward
their
salvation
if
only
some
island
of
safety
lies
in
the
course
of
their
innocent
activities
not
a
child
in
the
slums
is
born
to
be
lost
they
are
all
born
to
be
saved
and
the
raft
that
carries
them
unharmed
through
the
perilous
torrent
of
tenement
life
is
the
unconscious
aspiration
for
the
best
but
there
must
be
lighthouses
to
guide
him
midstream
dora
followed
joseph
to
hale
house
joining
a
club
for
little
girls
which
has
since
become
famous
in
the
hale
house
district
the
leader
of
this
club
under
pretence
of
teaching
the
little
girls
the
proper
way
to
sweep
and
make
beds
artfully
teaches
them
how
to
beautify
a
tenement
home
by
means
of
noble
living
joseph
and
dora
were
so
enthusiastic
about
hale
house
that
i
had
to
go
over
and
see
what
it
was
all
about
and
i
found
the
natural
history
club
i
do
not
know
how
black
who
was
then
the
resident
persuaded
me
to
try
the
natural
history
club
in
spite
of
my
aversion
for
bugs
i
suppose
she
tried
me
in
various
girls
clubs
and
found
that
i
did
not
fit
any
more
than
i
fitted
in
the
that
i
attempted
years
before
i
dare
say
she
decided
that
i
was
an
old
maid
and
urged
me
to
come
to
the
meetings
of
the
natural
history
club
which
was
composed
of
adults
the
members
of
this
club
were
not
people
from
the
neighborhood
i
understood
but
workers
at
hale
house
and
their
friends
and
they
often
had
eminent
naturalists
travellers
and
other
notables
lecture
before
them
my
curiosity
to
see
a
real
live
naturalist
probably
induced
me
to
accept
black
invitation
in
the
end
for
up
to
that
time
i
had
never
met
any
one
who
enjoyed
the
creepy
society
of
snakes
and
worms
except
in
books
the
natural
history
club
sat
in
a
ring
around
the
reception
room
facing
the
broad
doorway
of
the
adjoining
room
black
introduced
me
and
i
said
glad
to
meet
you
all
around
the
circle
and
sat
down
in
a
kindergarten
chair
beside
the
piano
it
was
friday
evening
and
i
had
the
sense
of
leisure
which
pervades
the
consciousness
when
there
is
to
be
no
school
on
the
morrow
i
liked
the
pleasant
room
pleasanter
than
any
at
home
i
liked
the
faces
of
the
company
i
was
in
i
was
prepared
to
have
an
agreeable
evening
even
if
i
was
a
little
bored
the
tall
lean
gentleman
with
the
frank
blue
eyes
got
up
to
read
the
minutes
of
the
last
meeting
i
did
not
understand
what
he
read
but
i
noticed
that
it
gave
him
great
satisfaction
this
man
had
greeted
me
as
if
he
had
been
waiting
for
my
coming
all
his
life
what
did
black
call
him
he
looked
and
spoke
as
if
he
was
happy
to
be
alive
i
liked
him
oh
yes
this
was
winthrop
i
let
my
thoughts
wander
with
my
eyes
all
around
the
circle
trying
to
read
the
characters
of
my
new
friends
in
their
faces
but
suddenly
my
attention
was
arrested
by
a
word
winthrop
had
finished
reading
the
minutes
and
was
introducing
the
speaker
of
the
evening
we
are
very
fortunate
in
having
with
us
emerson
whom
we
all
know
as
an
authority
on
spiders
what
hard
luck
winthrop
pronounced
the
word
spiders
with
unmistakable
relish
as
if
he
doted
on
the
horrid
creatures
but
i
my
nerves
contracted
into
a
tight
knot
i
gripped
the
arms
of
my
little
chair
determined
to
run
with
all
those
strangers
looking
on
i
watched
emerson
to
see
when
he
would
open
a
box
of
spiders
i
recalled
a
hideous
experience
of
long
ago
when
putting
on
a
dress
that
had
hung
on
the
wall
for
weeks
i
felt
a
thing
with
a
hundred
legs
crawling
down
my
bare
arm
and
shook
a
spider
out
of
my
sleeve
i
watched
the
lecturer
but
i
was
going
to
run
it
was
too
bad
that
black
had
not
warned
me
after
a
while
i
realized
that
the
lecturer
had
no
menagerie
in
his
pockets
he
talked
in
a
familiar
way
about
different
kinds
of
spiders
and
their
ways
and
as
he
talked
he
wove
across
the
doorway
where
he
stood
a
gigantic
spider
web
unwinding
a
ball
of
twine
in
his
hand
and
looping
various
lengths
on
invisible
tacks
he
had
ready
in
the
door
frame
i
was
fascinated
by
the
progress
of
the
web
i
forgot
my
terrors
i
began
to
follow
emerson
discourse
i
was
surprised
to
hear
how
much
there
was
to
know
about
a
dusty
little
spider
besides
that
he
could
spin
his
webs
as
fast
as
my
broom
could
sweep
them
away
the
drama
of
the
spider
daily
life
became
very
real
to
me
as
the
lecturer
went
on
his
struggle
for
existence
his
wars
with
his
enemies
his
wiles
his
traps
his
patient
labors
the
intricate
safeguards
of
his
simple
existence
the
fitness
of
his
body
for
his
surroundings
of
his
instincts
for
his
vital
needs
the
whole
picture
of
the
spider
pursuit
of
life
under
the
direction
of
definite
laws
filled
me
with
a
great
wonder
and
left
no
room
in
my
mind
for
repugnance
or
fear
it
was
the
first
time
the
natural
history
of
a
living
creature
had
been
presented
to
me
under
such
circumstances
that
i
could
not
avoid
hearing
and
seeing
and
i
was
surprised
at
my
dulness
in
the
past
when
i
had
rejected
books
on
natural
history
i
did
not
become
an
enthusiastic
amateur
naturalist
at
once
i
did
not
at
once
begin
to
collect
worms
and
bugs
but
on
the
next
i
stood
on
a
chair
craning
my
neck
to
study
the
spider
webs
i
discovered
in
the
corners
of
the
ceiling
and
one
or
two
webs
of
more
than
ordinary
perfection
i
suffered
to
remain
undisturbed
for
weeks
although
it
was
my
duty
as
a
to
sweep
the
ceiling
clean
i
began
to
watch
for
the
mice
that
were
wont
to
scurry
across
the
floor
when
the
house
slept
and
i
alone
waked
i
even
placed
a
crust
for
them
on
the
threshold
of
my
room
and
cultivated
a
breathless
intimacy
with
them
when
the
little
gray
beasts
acknowledged
my
hospitality
by
nibbling
my
crust
in
full
sight
and
so
by
degrees
i
came
to
a
better
understanding
of
my
animal
neighbors
on
all
sides
and
i
began
to
look
forward
to
the
meetings
of
the
natural
history
club
the
club
had
frequent
field
excursions
in
addition
to
the
regular
meetings
at
the
seashore
in
the
woods
in
the
fields
at
high
tide
and
low
tide
in
summer
and
winter
by
sunlight
and
by
moonlight
the
marvellous
story
of
orderly
nature
was
revealed
to
me
in
fragments
that
allured
the
imagination
and
made
me
beg
for
more
some
of
the
members
of
the
club
were
accustomed
to
answering
questions
all
of
them
were
patient
some
of
them
took
special
pains
with
me
but
nobody
took
me
seriously
as
a
member
of
the
club
they
called
me
the
club
mascot
and
appointed
me
curator
of
the
club
museum
which
was
not
in
existence
at
a
salary
of
ten
cents
a
year
which
was
never
paid
and
i
was
well
pleased
with
my
unique
position
in
the
club
delighted
with
my
new
friends
enraptured
with
my
new
study
illustration
the
natural
history
club
had
frequent
field
excursions
more
and
more
as
the
seasons
rolled
by
and
page
after
page
of
the
book
of
nature
was
turned
before
my
eager
eyes
did
i
feel
the
wonder
and
thrill
of
the
revelations
of
science
till
all
my
thoughts
became
colored
with
the
tints
of
infinite
truths
my
days
arranged
themselves
around
the
meetings
of
the
club
as
a
centre
the
whole
structure
of
my
life
was
transfigured
by
my
novel
experiences
outdoors
i
realized
with
a
shock
at
first
but
afterwards
with
complacency
that
books
were
taking
a
secondary
place
in
my
life
my
irregular
studies
in
natural
history
holding
the
first
place
i
began
to
enjoy
the
natural
history
rooms
and
i
was
obliged
to
admit
to
myself
that
my
heart
hung
with
a
more
thrilling
suspense
over
the
fate
of
some
beans
i
had
planted
in
a
window
box
than
over
the
fortunes
of
the
classic
hero
about
whom
we
were
reading
at
school
but
for
all
my
enthusiasm
about
animals
plants
and
rocks
for
all
my
devotion
to
the
natural
history
club
i
did
not
become
a
thorough
naturalist
my
scientific
friends
were
right
not
to
take
me
seriously
winthrop
in
his
delightfully
frank
way
called
me
a
fraud
and
i
did
not
resent
it
i
dipped
into
zoölogy
botany
geology
ornithology
and
an
infinite
number
of
other
ologies
as
the
activities
of
the
club
or
of
particular
members
of
it
gave
me
opportunity
but
i
made
no
systematic
study
of
any
branch
of
science
at
least
not
until
i
went
to
college
for
what
enthralled
my
imagination
in
the
whole
subject
of
natural
history
was
not
the
orderly
array
of
facts
but
the
glimpse
i
caught
through
this
or
that
fragment
of
science
of
the
grand
principles
underlying
the
facts
by
asking
questions
by
listening
when
my
wise
friends
talked
by
reading
by
pondering
and
dreaming
i
slowly
gathered
together
the
kaleidoscopic
bits
of
the
stupendous
panorama
which
is
painted
in
the
literature
of
darwinism
everything
i
had
ever
learned
at
school
was
illumined
by
this
new
knowledge
the
world
lay
newly
made
under
my
eyes
vastly
as
my
mind
had
stretched
to
embrace
the
idea
of
a
great
country
when
i
exchanged
polotzk
for
america
it
was
no
such
enlargement
as
i
now
experienced
when
in
place
of
the
measurable
earth
with
its
paltry
tale
of
historic
centuries
i
was
given
the
illimitable
universe
to
contemplate
with
the
numberless
æons
of
infinite
time
as
the
meaning
of
nature
was
deepened
for
me
so
was
its
aspect
beautified
hitherto
i
had
loved
in
nature
the
spectacular
the
blazing
sunset
the
whirling
tempest
the
flush
of
summer
the
of
winter
now
for
the
first
time
my
heart
was
satisfied
with
the
microscopic
perfection
of
a
solitary
blossom
the
harmonious
murmur
of
autumn
woods
broke
up
into
a
hundred
separate
melodies
as
the
pelting
acorn
the
scurrying
squirrel
the
infrequent
chirp
of
the
lingering
cricket
and
the
soft
speed
of
ripe
pine
cones
through
branches
each
struck
its
discriminate
chord
in
the
scented
air
the
outdoor
world
was
magnified
in
every
dimension
inanimate
things
were
vivified
living
things
were
dignified
no
two
persons
set
the
same
value
on
any
given
thing
and
so
it
may
very
well
be
that
i
am
boasting
of
the
enrichment
of
my
life
through
the
study
of
natural
history
to
ears
that
hear
not
i
need
only
recall
my
own
obtuseness
to
the
subject
before
the
story
of
the
spider
sharpened
my
senses
to
realize
that
these
confessions
of
a
nature
lover
may
bore
every
other
person
who
reads
them
but
i
do
not
pretend
to
be
concerned
about
the
reader
at
this
point
i
never
hope
to
explain
to
my
neighbor
the
exact
value
of
a
winter
sunrise
in
my
spiritual
economy
but
i
know
that
my
life
has
grown
better
since
i
learned
to
distinguish
between
a
butterfly
and
a
moth
that
my
faith
in
man
is
the
greater
because
i
have
watched
for
the
coming
of
the
song
sparrow
in
the
spring
and
my
thoughts
of
immortality
are
the
less
wavering
because
i
have
cherished
the
winter
duckweed
on
my
lawn
those
who
find
their
greatest
intellectual
and
emotional
satisfaction
in
the
study
of
nature
are
apt
to
refer
their
spiritual
problems
also
to
science
that
is
how
it
went
with
me
long
before
my
introduction
to
natural
history
i
had
realized
with
an
uneasy
sense
of
the
breaking
of
peace
that
the
questions
which
i
thought
to
have
been
settled
years
before
were
beginning
to
tease
me
anew
in
russia
i
had
practised
a
prescribed
religion
with
little
faith
in
what
i
professed
and
a
restless
questioning
of
the
universe
when
i
came
to
america
i
lightly
dropped
the
religious
forms
that
i
had
half
mocked
before
and
contented
myself
with
a
few
novel
phrases
employed
by
my
father
in
his
attempt
to
explain
the
riddle
of
existence
the
busy
years
flew
by
when
from
morning
till
night
i
was
preoccupied
with
the
process
of
becoming
an
american
and
no
question
arose
in
my
mind
that
my
books
or
my
teachers
could
not
fully
answer
then
came
a
time
when
the
ordinary
business
of
my
girl
life
discharged
itself
automatically
and
i
had
leisure
once
more
to
look
over
and
around
things
this
period
coinciding
with
my
moody
adolescence
i
rapidly
entangled
myself
in
a
net
of
doubts
and
questions
after
the
manner
of
a
growing
girl
i
asked
once
more
how
did
i
come
to
be
and
i
found
that
i
was
no
whit
wiser
than
poor
reb
lebe
whom
i
had
despised
for
his
ignorance
for
all
my
years
of
america
and
schooling
i
could
give
no
better
answer
to
my
clamoring
questions
than
the
teacher
of
my
childhood
whence
came
the
fair
world
was
there
a
god
after
all
and
if
so
what
did
he
intend
when
he
made
me
it
was
always
my
way
if
i
wanted
anything
to
turn
my
daily
life
into
a
pursuit
of
that
thing
have
you
seen
the
treasure
i
seek
i
asked
of
every
man
i
met
and
if
it
was
god
that
i
desired
i
made
all
my
friends
search
their
hearts
for
evidence
of
his
being
i
asked
all
the
wise
people
i
knew
what
they
were
going
to
do
with
themselves
after
death
and
if
the
wise
failed
to
satisfy
me
i
questioned
the
simple
and
listened
to
the
babies
talking
in
their
sleep
still
the
imperative
clamor
of
my
mind
remained
unallayed
was
all
my
life
to
be
a
hunger
and
a
questioning
i
complained
of
my
teachers
who
stuffed
my
head
with
facts
and
gave
my
soul
no
crumb
to
feed
on
i
blamed
the
stars
for
their
silence
i
sat
up
nights
brooding
over
the
emptiness
of
knowledge
and
praying
for
revelations
sometimes
i
lived
for
days
in
a
chimera
of
doubts
feeling
that
it
was
hardly
worth
while
living
at
all
if
i
was
never
to
know
why
i
was
born
and
why
i
could
not
live
forever
it
was
in
one
of
these
prolonged
moods
that
i
heard
that
a
friend
of
mine
a
distinguished
man
of
letters
whom
i
greatly
admired
was
coming
to
boston
for
a
short
visit
a
terrific
new
england
blizzard
arrived
some
hours
in
advance
of
my
friend
train
but
so
intent
was
i
on
questioning
him
that
i
disregarded
the
weather
and
struggled
through
towering
snowdrifts
in
the
teeth
of
the
wild
wind
to
the
railroad
station
there
i
nearly
perished
of
weariness
while
waiting
for
the
train
which
was
delayed
by
the
storm
but
when
my
friend
emerged
from
one
of
the
cars
i
was
rewarded
for
the
blizzard
had
kept
the
reporters
away
and
the
great
man
could
give
me
his
undivided
attention
no
doubt
he
understood
the
pressing
importance
of
the
matter
to
me
from
the
trouble
i
had
taken
to
secure
an
early
interview
with
him
he
heard
me
out
very
soberly
and
answered
my
questions
as
honestly
as
a
thinking
man
could
not
a
word
of
what
he
said
remains
in
my
mind
but
i
remember
going
away
with
the
impression
that
it
was
possible
to
live
without
knowing
everything
after
all
and
that
i
might
even
try
to
be
happy
in
a
world
full
of
riddles
in
such
ways
as
this
i
sought
peace
of
mind
but
i
never
achieved
more
than
a
brief
truce
i
was
coming
to
believe
that
only
the
stupid
could
be
happy
and
that
life
was
pretty
hard
on
the
philosophical
when
the
great
new
interest
of
science
came
into
my
life
and
scattered
my
blue
devils
as
the
sun
scatters
the
night
damps
some
of
my
friends
in
the
natural
history
club
were
deeply
versed
in
the
principles
of
evolutionary
science
and
were
able
to
guide
me
in
my
impetuous
rush
to
learn
everything
in
a
day
i
was
in
a
hurry
to
deduce
from
the
conglomeration
of
isolated
facts
that
i
picked
up
in
the
lectures
the
final
solution
of
all
my
problems
it
took
both
patience
and
wisdom
to
check
me
and
at
the
same
time
satisfy
me
i
have
no
doubt
but
then
i
was
always
fortunate
in
my
friends
wisdom
and
patience
in
plenty
were
spent
on
me
and
i
was
instructed
and
inspired
and
comforted
of
course
my
wisest
teacher
was
not
able
to
tell
me
how
the
original
spark
of
life
was
kindled
nor
to
point
out
on
the
starry
map
of
heaven
my
future
abode
the
bread
of
absolute
knowledge
i
do
not
hope
to
taste
in
this
life
but
all
creation
was
remodelled
on
a
grander
scale
by
the
utterances
of
my
teachers
and
my
problems
though
they
deepened
with
the
expansion
of
all
nameable
phenomena
were
carried
up
to
the
heights
of
the
impersonal
and
ceased
to
torment
me
seeing
how
life
and
death
beginning
and
end
were
all
parts
of
the
process
of
being
it
mattered
less
in
what
particular
ripple
of
the
flux
of
existence
i
found
myself
if
past
time
was
a
trooping
of
similar
yesterdays
back
over
the
unbroken
millenniums
to
the
first
moment
it
was
simple
to
think
of
future
time
as
a
trooping
of
knowable
on
and
on
to
infinity
possibly
also
the
spark
of
life
that
had
persisted
through
the
geological
ages
under
a
million
million
disguises
was
vital
enough
to
continue
for
another
in
some
shape
as
potent
as
the
first
or
last
thinking
in
æons
and
in
races
instead
of
in
years
and
individuals
somehow
lightened
the
burden
of
intelligence
and
filled
me
anew
with
a
sense
of
youth
and
that
i
had
almost
lost
in
the
pit
of
my
narrow
personal
doubts
no
one
who
understands
the
nature
of
youth
will
be
misled
by
this
summary
of
my
intellectual
history
into
thinking
that
i
actually
arranged
my
newly
acquired
scientific
knowledge
into
any
such
orderly
philosophy
as
for
the
sake
of
clearness
i
have
outlined
above
i
had
long
passed
my
teens
and
had
seen
something
of
life
that
is
not
revealed
to
poetizing
girls
before
i
could
give
any
logical
account
of
what
i
read
in
the
book
of
cosmogony
but
the
high
peaks
of
the
promised
land
of
evolution
did
flash
on
my
vision
in
the
earlier
days
and
with
these
to
guide
me
i
rebuilt
the
world
and
found
it
much
nobler
than
it
had
ever
been
before
and
took
great
comfort
in
it
i
did
not
become
a
finished
philosopher
from
hearing
a
couple
of
hundred
lectures
on
scientific
subjects
i
did
not
even
become
a
finished
woman
if
anything
i
grew
rather
more
girlish
i
remember
myself
as
very
merry
in
the
midst
of
my
serious
scientific
friends
and
i
can
think
of
no
time
when
i
was
more
inclined
to
play
the
tomboy
than
when
off
for
a
day
in
the
woods
in
quest
of
botanical
and
zoological
specimens
the
freedom
of
outdoors
the
society
of
congenial
friends
the
delight
of
my
occupation
all
acted
as
a
strong
wine
on
my
mood
and
sent
my
spirits
soaring
to
immoderate
heights
i
am
very
much
afraid
i
made
myself
a
nuisance
at
times
to
some
of
the
more
sedate
of
my
companions
i
wish
they
could
know
that
i
have
truly
repented
i
wish
they
had
known
at
the
time
that
it
was
the
exuberance
of
my
happiness
that
played
tricks
and
no
wicked
desire
to
annoy
kind
friends
but
i
am
sure
that
those
who
were
offended
have
long
since
forgotten
or
forgiven
and
i
need
remember
nothing
of
those
wonderful
days
other
than
that
a
new
sun
rose
above
a
new
earth
for
me
and
that
my
happiness
was
like
unto
the
iridescent
dews
chapter
xix
a
kingdom
in
the
slums
i
did
not
always
wait
for
the
natural
history
club
to
guide
me
to
delectable
lands
some
of
the
happiest
days
of
that
happy
time
i
spent
with
my
sister
in
east
boston
we
had
a
merry
time
at
supper
moses
making
clever
jokes
without
cracking
a
smile
himself
and
the
baby
romping
in
his
high
chair
eating
what
was
good
for
him
but
the
best
of
the
evening
came
later
when
father
and
baby
had
gone
to
bed
and
the
dishes
were
put
away
and
there
was
not
a
crumb
left
on
the
checked
tablecloth
frieda
took
out
her
sewing
and
i
took
a
book
and
the
lamp
was
between
us
shining
on
the
table
on
the
large
brown
roses
on
the
wall
on
the
green
and
brown
diamonds
of
the
oil
cloth
on
the
floor
on
the
baby
rattle
on
a
shelf
and
on
the
shining
stove
in
the
corner
it
was
such
a
pleasant
kitchen
such
a
cosey
friendly
room
that
when
frieda
and
i
were
left
alone
i
was
perfectly
happy
just
to
sit
there
frieda
had
a
beautiful
parlor
with
plush
chairs
and
a
velvet
carpet
and
gilt
picture
frames
but
we
preferred
the
homely
homelike
kitchen
i
read
aloud
from
longfellow
or
whittier
or
tennyson
and
it
was
as
great
a
treat
to
me
as
it
was
to
frieda
her
attention
alone
was
inspiring
her
delight
her
eager
questions
doubled
the
meaning
of
the
lines
i
read
poor
frieda
had
little
enough
time
for
reading
unless
she
stole
it
from
the
sewing
or
the
baking
or
the
mending
but
she
was
hungry
for
books
and
so
grateful
when
i
came
to
read
to
her
that
it
made
me
ashamed
to
remember
all
the
beautiful
things
i
had
and
did
not
share
with
her
it
is
true
i
shared
what
could
be
shared
i
brought
my
friends
to
her
at
her
wedding
were
some
of
the
friends
of
whom
i
was
most
proud
miss
dillingham
came
and
hurd
and
the
humbler
guests
stared
in
admiration
at
our
and
editors
but
i
had
so
many
delightful
things
that
i
could
not
bring
to
frieda
my
walks
my
dreams
my
adventures
of
all
sorts
and
yet
when
i
told
her
about
them
i
found
that
she
partook
of
everything
for
she
had
her
talent
for
vicarious
enjoyment
by
means
of
which
she
entered
as
an
actor
into
my
adventures
was
present
as
a
witness
at
the
frolic
of
my
younger
life
or
if
i
narrated
things
that
were
beyond
her
on
account
of
her
narrower
experience
she
listened
with
an
eager
longing
to
understand
that
was
better
than
some
people
easy
comprehension
my
world
ever
rang
with
good
tidings
and
she
was
grateful
if
i
brought
her
the
echo
of
them
to
ring
again
within
the
four
walls
of
the
kitchen
that
bounded
her
life
and
i
who
lived
on
the
heights
and
walked
with
the
learned
and
bathed
in
the
crystal
fountains
of
youth
sometimes
climbed
the
sublimest
peak
in
my
sister
humble
kitchen
there
caught
the
unfaltering
accents
of
inspiration
and
rejoiced
in
silver
pools
of
untried
happiness
the
way
she
reached
out
for
everything
fine
was
shown
by
her
interest
in
the
incomprehensible
latin
and
french
books
that
i
brought
she
liked
to
hear
me
read
my
cicero
pleased
by
the
movement
of
the
sonorous
periods
i
translated
ovid
and
virgil
for
her
and
her
pleasure
illumined
the
difficult
passages
so
that
i
seldom
needed
to
have
recourse
to
the
dictionary
i
shall
never
forget
the
evening
i
read
to
her
from
the
æneid
the
passage
in
the
fourth
book
describing
the
death
of
dido
i
read
the
latin
first
and
then
my
own
version
in
english
hexameters
that
i
had
prepared
for
a
recitation
at
school
frieda
forgot
her
sewing
in
her
lap
and
leaned
forward
in
rapt
attention
when
i
was
through
there
were
tears
of
delight
in
her
eyes
and
i
was
surprised
myself
at
the
beauty
of
the
words
i
had
just
pronounced
i
do
not
dare
to
confess
how
much
of
my
latin
i
have
forgotten
lest
any
of
the
devoted
teachers
who
taught
me
should
learn
the
sad
truth
but
i
shall
always
boast
of
some
acquaintance
with
virgil
through
that
scrap
of
the
æneid
made
memorable
by
my
sister
enjoyment
of
it
truly
my
education
was
not
entirely
in
the
hands
of
persons
who
had
licenses
to
teach
my
sister
fat
baby
taught
me
things
about
the
origin
and
ultimate
destiny
of
dimples
that
were
not
in
any
of
my
casey
of
the
second
floor
who
was
drunk
whenever
his
wife
was
sober
gave
me
an
insight
into
the
psychology
of
the
beer
mug
that
would
have
added
to
the
mental
furniture
of
my
most
scholarly
teacher
the
girls
who
passed
the
evening
on
the
corner
in
promiscuous
flirtation
with
the
youths
of
the
neighborhood
unconsciously
revealed
to
me
the
eternal
secrets
of
adolescence
my
neighbor
of
the
third
floor
who
sat
on
the
curbstone
with
the
scabby
baby
in
her
bedraggled
lap
had
things
to
say
about
the
fine
ladies
who
came
in
carriages
to
inspect
the
public
bathhouse
across
the
street
that
ought
to
be
repeated
in
the
lecture
halls
of
every
school
of
philanthropy
instruction
poured
into
my
brain
at
such
a
rate
that
i
could
not
digest
it
all
at
the
time
but
in
later
years
when
my
destiny
had
led
me
far
from
dover
street
the
emphatic
moral
of
those
lessons
became
clear
the
memory
of
my
experience
on
dover
street
became
the
strength
of
my
convictions
the
illumined
index
of
my
purpose
the
aureola
of
my
happiness
and
if
i
paid
for
those
lessons
with
days
of
privation
and
dread
with
nights
of
tormenting
anxiety
i
count
the
price
cheap
who
would
not
go
to
a
little
trouble
to
find
out
what
life
is
made
of
life
in
the
slums
spins
busily
as
a
schoolboy
top
and
one
who
has
heard
its
humming
never
forgets
i
look
forward
to
telling
when
i
get
to
be
a
master
of
language
what
i
read
in
the
crooked
cobblestones
when
i
revisited
dover
street
the
other
day
dover
street
was
never
really
my
residence
at
least
not
the
whole
of
it
it
happened
to
be
the
nook
where
my
bed
was
made
but
i
inhabited
the
city
of
boston
in
the
morning
in
the
evening
i
was
empress
of
all
i
surveyed
from
the
roof
of
the
tenement
house
i
could
point
in
any
direction
and
name
a
friend
who
would
welcome
me
there
off
towards
the
northwest
in
the
direction
of
harvard
bridge
which
some
day
i
should
cross
on
my
way
to
radcliffe
college
was
one
of
my
favorite
palaces
whither
i
resorted
every
day
after
school
a
low
building
with
a
dignified
granite
front
it
was
flanked
on
all
sides
by
noble
old
churches
museums
and
harmoniously
disposed
around
a
spacious
triangle
called
copley
square
two
thoroughfares
that
came
straight
from
the
green
suburbs
swept
by
my
palace
one
on
either
side
converged
at
the
apex
of
the
triangle
and
pointed
off
past
the
public
garden
across
the
historic
common
to
the
domed
state
house
sitting
on
a
height
it
was
my
habit
to
go
very
slowly
up
the
low
broad
steps
to
the
palace
entrance
pleasing
my
eyes
with
the
majestic
lines
of
the
building
and
lingering
to
read
again
the
carved
inscriptions
by
the
to
did
i
not
say
it
was
my
palace
mine
because
i
was
a
citizen
mine
though
i
was
born
an
alien
mine
though
i
lived
on
dover
street
my
palace
i
loved
to
lean
against
a
pillar
in
the
entrance
hall
watching
the
people
go
in
and
out
groups
of
children
hushed
their
chatter
at
the
entrance
and
skipped
whispering
and
giggling
in
their
fists
up
the
grand
stairway
patting
the
great
stone
lions
at
the
top
with
an
eye
on
the
aged
policemen
down
below
spectacled
scholars
came
slowly
down
the
stairs
loaded
with
books
heedless
of
the
lofty
arches
that
echoed
their
steps
visitors
from
out
of
town
lingered
long
in
the
entrance
hall
studying
the
inscriptions
and
symbols
on
the
marble
floor
and
i
loved
to
stand
in
the
midst
of
all
this
and
remind
myself
that
i
was
there
that
i
had
a
right
to
be
there
that
i
was
at
home
there
all
these
eager
children
all
these
women
all
these
scholars
going
home
to
write
learned
books
i
and
they
had
this
glorious
thing
in
common
this
noble
treasure
house
of
learning
it
was
wonderful
to
say
is
it
was
thrilling
to
say
is
i
visited
every
part
of
the
building
that
was
open
to
the
public
i
spent
rapt
hours
studying
the
abbey
pictures
i
repeated
to
myself
lines
from
tennyson
poem
before
the
glowing
scenes
of
the
holy
grail
before
the
prophets
in
the
gallery
above
i
was
mute
but
echoes
of
the
hebrew
psalms
i
had
long
forgotten
throbbed
somewhere
in
the
depths
of
my
consciousness
the
chavannes
series
around
the
main
staircase
i
did
not
enjoy
for
years
i
thought
the
pictures
looked
faded
and
their
symbolism
somehow
failed
to
move
me
at
first
bates
hall
was
the
place
where
i
spent
my
longest
hours
in
the
library
i
chose
a
seat
far
at
one
end
so
that
looking
up
from
my
books
i
would
get
the
full
effect
of
the
vast
i
felt
the
grand
spaces
under
the
soaring
arches
as
a
personal
attribute
of
my
being
the
courtyard
was
my
chamber
of
dreams
slowly
strolling
past
the
endless
pillars
of
the
colonnade
the
fountain
murmured
in
my
ear
of
all
the
beautiful
things
in
all
the
beautiful
world
i
imagined
that
i
was
a
greek
of
the
classic
days
treading
on
sandalled
feet
through
the
glistening
marble
porticoes
of
athens
i
expected
to
see
if
i
looked
over
my
shoulder
a
bearded
philosopher
in
a
drooping
mantle
surrounded
by
beautiful
youths
with
wreathed
locks
everything
i
read
in
school
in
latin
or
greek
everything
in
my
history
books
was
real
to
me
here
in
this
courtyard
set
about
with
stately
columns
here
is
where
i
liked
to
remind
myself
of
polotzk
the
better
to
bring
out
the
wonder
of
my
life
that
i
who
was
born
in
the
prison
of
the
pale
should
roam
at
will
in
the
land
of
freedom
was
a
marvel
that
it
did
me
good
to
realize
that
i
who
was
brought
up
to
my
teens
almost
without
a
book
should
be
set
down
in
the
midst
of
all
the
books
that
ever
were
written
was
a
miracle
as
great
as
any
on
record
that
an
outcast
should
become
a
privileged
citizen
that
a
beggar
should
dwell
in
a
palace
this
was
a
romance
more
thrilling
than
poet
ever
sung
surely
i
was
rocked
in
an
enchanted
cradle
illustration
bates
hall
where
i
spent
my
longest
hours
in
the
library
from
the
public
library
to
the
state
house
is
only
a
step
and
i
found
my
way
there
without
a
guide
the
state
house
was
one
of
the
places
i
could
point
to
and
say
that
i
had
a
friend
there
to
welcome
me
i
do
not
mean
the
representative
of
my
district
though
i
hope
he
was
a
worthy
man
my
friend
was
no
less
a
man
than
the
honorable
senator
roe
from
worcester
whose
letters
to
me
written
under
the
embossed
letter
head
of
the
senate
chamber
i
could
not
help
exhibiting
to
florence
connolly
how
did
i
come
by
a
senator
through
being
a
citizen
of
boston
of
course
to
be
a
citizen
of
the
smallest
village
in
the
united
states
which
maintains
a
free
school
and
a
public
library
is
to
stand
in
the
path
of
the
splendid
processions
of
opportunity
and
as
boston
has
rather
better
schools
and
a
rather
finer
library
than
some
other
villages
it
comes
natural
there
for
children
in
the
slums
to
summon
gentlemen
from
the
state
house
to
be
their
personal
friends
it
is
so
simple
in
boston
you
are
a
and
your
teacher
gives
you
a
ticket
for
the
annual
historical
lecture
in
the
old
south
church
on
washington
birthday
you
hear
a
stirring
discourse
on
some
subject
in
your
country
history
and
you
go
home
with
a
heart
bursting
with
patriotism
you
sit
down
and
write
a
letter
to
the
speaker
who
so
moved
you
telling
him
how
glad
you
are
to
be
an
american
explaining
to
him
if
you
happen
to
be
a
recently
made
american
why
you
love
your
adopted
country
so
much
better
than
your
native
land
perhaps
the
patriotic
lecturer
happens
to
be
a
senator
and
he
reads
your
letter
under
the
vast
dome
of
the
state
house
and
it
occurs
to
him
that
he
and
his
eminent
colleagues
and
the
stately
capitol
and
the
glorious
flag
that
floats
above
it
all
gathered
on
the
hill
above
the
common
do
his
country
no
greater
honor
than
the
outspoken
admiration
of
an
ardent
young
alien
the
senator
replies
to
your
letter
inviting
you
to
visit
him
at
the
state
house
and
in
the
renowned
chamber
where
the
august
business
of
the
state
is
conducted
you
an
obscure
child
from
the
slums
and
he
a
chosen
leader
of
the
people
seal
a
democratic
friendship
based
on
the
love
of
a
common
flag
even
simpler
than
to
meet
a
senator
was
it
to
become
acquainted
with
a
man
like
edward
everett
hale
the
grand
old
man
of
boston
the
people
called
him
from
the
manner
of
his
life
among
them
he
kept
open
house
in
every
public
building
in
the
city
wherever
two
citizens
met
to
devise
a
measure
for
the
public
weal
he
was
a
third
wherever
a
worthy
cause
needed
a
champion
hale
lifted
his
mighty
voice
at
some
time
or
another
his
colossal
figure
towered
above
an
eager
multitude
from
every
pulpit
in
the
city
from
every
lecture
platform
and
where
is
the
map
of
boston
that
gives
the
names
of
the
lost
alleys
and
back
ways
where
the
great
man
went
in
search
of
the
lame
in
body
who
could
not
join
the
public
assembly
in
quest
of
the
maimed
in
spirit
who
feared
to
show
their
faces
in
the
open
if
all
the
little
children
who
have
sat
on
hale
knee
were
started
in
a
procession
on
the
state
house
steps
standing
four
abreast
there
would
be
a
lane
of
merry
faces
across
the
common
out
to
the
public
library
over
harvard
bridge
and
away
beyond
to
remoter
landmarks
that
i
met
hale
is
no
wonder
it
was
as
inevitable
as
that
i
should
be
a
year
older
every
twelvemonth
he
was
a
part
of
boston
as
the
salt
wave
is
a
part
of
the
sea
i
can
hardly
say
whether
he
came
to
me
or
i
came
to
him
we
met
and
my
adopted
country
took
me
closer
to
her
breast
a
day
or
two
after
our
first
meeting
i
called
on
hale
at
his
invitation
it
was
only
eight
in
the
morning
you
may
be
sure
because
he
had
risen
early
to
attend
to
a
hundred
great
affairs
and
i
had
risen
early
so
as
to
talk
with
a
great
man
before
i
went
to
school
i
think
we
liked
each
other
a
little
the
more
for
the
fact
that
when
so
many
people
were
still
asleep
we
were
already
busy
in
the
interests
of
citizenship
and
friendship
we
certainly
liked
each
other
i
am
sure
i
did
not
stay
more
than
fifteen
minutes
and
all
that
i
recall
of
our
conversation
was
that
hale
asked
me
a
great
many
questions
about
russia
in
a
manner
that
made
me
feel
that
i
was
an
authority
on
the
subject
and
with
his
great
hand
in
he
gave
me
a
bit
of
homely
advice
namely
that
i
should
never
study
before
breakfast
that
was
all
but
for
the
rest
of
the
day
i
moved
against
a
background
of
grandeur
there
was
a
noble
ring
to
virgil
that
day
that
even
my
teacher
firm
translation
had
never
brought
out
before
obscure
points
in
the
history
lesson
were
clear
to
me
alone
of
the
thirty
girls
in
the
class
and
it
happened
that
the
tulips
in
copley
square
opened
that
day
and
shone
in
the
sun
like
lighted
lamps
any
one
could
be
happy
a
year
on
dover
street
after
spending
half
an
hour
on
highland
street
i
enjoyed
so
many
in
the
great
man
house
that
i
do
not
know
how
to
convey
the
sense
of
my
remembered
happiness
my
friend
used
to
keep
me
in
conversation
a
few
minutes
in
the
famous
study
that
was
fit
to
have
been
preserved
as
a
shrine
after
which
he
sent
me
to
roam
about
the
house
and
explore
his
library
and
take
away
what
books
i
pleased
who
would
feel
cramped
in
a
tenement
with
such
royal
privileges
as
these
once
i
brought
hale
a
present
a
copy
of
a
story
of
mine
that
had
been
printed
in
a
journal
and
from
his
manner
of
accepting
it
you
might
have
thought
that
i
was
a
princess
dispensing
gifts
from
a
throne
i
wish
i
had
asked
him
that
last
time
i
talked
with
him
how
it
was
that
he
who
was
so
modest
made
those
who
walked
with
him
so
great
modest
as
the
man
was
the
house
in
which
he
lived
a
gray
old
house
of
a
style
that
new
england
no
longer
builds
with
a
pillared
porch
curtained
by
vines
set
back
in
the
yard
behind
the
old
trees
whatever
cherished
flowers
glowed
in
the
garden
behind
the
house
the
common
daisy
was
encouraged
to
bloom
in
front
and
was
there
sun
or
snow
on
the
ground
the
most
timid
hand
could
open
the
gate
the
most
humble
visitor
was
sure
of
a
welcome
out
of
that
modest
house
the
troubled
came
comforted
the
fallen
came
uplifted
the
noble
came
inspired
my
explorations
of
hale
house
might
not
have
brought
me
to
the
gables
but
for
my
friend
daughter
the
artist
who
had
a
studio
at
the
top
of
the
house
she
asked
me
one
day
if
i
would
sit
for
a
portrait
and
i
consented
with
the
greatest
alacrity
it
would
be
an
interesting
experience
and
interesting
experiences
were
the
bread
of
life
to
me
i
agreed
to
come
every
saturday
morning
and
felt
that
something
was
going
to
happen
to
dover
street
illustration
the
famous
study
that
was
fit
to
have
been
preserved
as
a
shrine
when
i
came
home
from
my
talk
with
miss
hale
i
studied
myself
long
in
my
blotched
i
saw
just
what
i
expected
my
face
was
too
thin
my
nose
too
large
my
complexion
too
dull
my
hair
which
was
curly
enough
was
too
short
to
be
described
as
luxurious
tresses
and
the
color
was
neither
brown
nor
black
my
hands
were
neither
white
nor
velvety
the
fingers
ended
decidedly
instead
of
tapering
off
like
rosy
dreams
i
was
disgusted
with
my
wrists
they
showed
too
far
below
the
tight
sleeves
of
my
dress
of
the
year
before
last
and
they
looked
consumptive
no
it
was
not
for
my
beauty
that
miss
hale
wanted
to
paint
me
it
was
because
i
was
a
girl
a
person
a
piece
of
creation
i
understood
perfectly
if
i
could
write
an
interesting
composition
about
a
broom
why
should
not
an
artist
be
able
to
make
an
interesting
picture
of
me
i
had
done
it
with
the
broom
and
the
milk
wagon
and
the
rain
spout
it
was
not
what
a
thing
was
that
made
it
interesting
but
what
i
was
able
to
draw
out
of
it
it
was
exciting
to
speculate
as
to
what
miss
hale
was
going
to
draw
out
of
me
the
first
sitting
was
indeed
exciting
there
was
hardly
any
sitting
to
it
we
did
nothing
but
move
around
the
studio
and
move
the
easel
around
and
try
on
ever
so
many
backgrounds
and
ever
so
many
poses
in
the
end
of
course
we
left
everything
just
as
it
had
been
at
the
start
because
miss
hale
had
had
the
right
idea
from
the
beginning
but
i
understood
that
a
preliminary
tempest
in
the
studio
was
the
proper
way
to
test
that
idea
i
was
surprised
to
find
that
i
should
not
be
obliged
to
hold
my
breath
and
should
be
allowed
to
wink
all
i
wanted
posing
was
just
sitting
with
my
hands
in
my
lap
and
enjoying
the
most
interesting
conversation
with
the
artist
we
hit
upon
such
topics
once
i
remember
we
talked
about
the
marriage
laws
of
different
states
i
had
a
glorious
time
and
i
believe
miss
hale
did
too
i
watched
the
progress
of
the
portrait
with
utter
lack
of
comprehension
and
with
perfect
faith
in
the
ultimate
result
the
morning
flew
so
fast
that
i
could
have
sat
right
on
into
the
afternoon
without
tiring
once
or
twice
i
stayed
to
lunch
and
sat
opposite
the
artist
mother
at
table
it
was
like
sitting
face
to
face
with
martha
washington
i
thought
everything
was
wonderful
in
that
wonderful
old
house
one
thing
disturbed
my
enjoyment
of
those
saturday
mornings
it
was
a
small
thing
hardly
as
big
as
a
it
was
a
silver
coin
which
miss
hale
gave
me
regularly
when
i
was
going
i
knew
that
models
were
paid
for
sitting
but
i
was
not
a
professional
model
when
people
sat
for
their
portraits
they
usually
paid
the
artist
instead
of
the
artist
paying
them
of
course
i
had
not
ordered
this
portrait
but
i
had
such
a
good
time
sitting
that
it
did
not
seem
to
me
i
could
be
earning
money
but
what
troubled
me
was
not
the
suspicion
that
i
did
not
earn
the
money
but
that
i
did
not
know
what
was
in
my
mind
when
she
gave
it
to
me
was
it
possible
that
miss
hale
had
asked
me
to
sit
on
purpose
to
be
able
to
pay
me
so
that
i
could
help
pay
the
rent
everybody
knew
about
the
rent
sooner
or
later
because
i
was
always
asking
my
friends
what
a
girl
could
do
to
make
the
landlady
happy
very
possibly
miss
hale
had
my
landlady
in
mind
when
she
asked
me
to
pose
i
might
have
asked
her
i
dearly
loved
explanations
which
cleared
up
hidden
motives
but
her
answer
would
not
have
made
any
real
difference
i
should
have
accepted
the
money
just
the
same
miss
hale
was
not
a
stranger
like
strong
when
he
offered
me
a
quarter
she
knew
me
she
believed
in
my
cause
and
she
wanted
to
contribute
to
it
thus
i
in
my
analyses
of
persons
and
motives
while
the
portrait
went
steadily
on
it
was
miss
hale
who
first
found
a
use
for
our
superfluous
baby
she
came
to
dover
street
several
times
to
study
our
tiny
celia
in
swaddling
clothes
improvised
by
my
mother
after
the
fashion
of
the
old
country
miss
hale
wanted
a
baby
for
a
picture
of
the
nativity
which
she
was
doing
for
her
father
church
and
of
all
the
babies
in
boston
our
celia
our
little
jewish
celia
was
posing
for
the
christ
child
it
does
not
matter
in
this
connection
that
the
infant
that
lies
in
the
lantern
light
brooded
over
by
the
mother
divine
sorrow
of
love
in
the
beautiful
altar
piece
in
hale
church
was
not
actually
painted
from
my
mother
baby
in
the
end
the
point
is
that
my
mother
in
less
than
half
a
dozen
years
of
america
had
so
far
shaken
off
her
ancient
superstitions
that
she
feared
no
evil
consequence
from
letting
her
child
pose
for
a
christian
picture
a
busy
life
i
led
on
dover
street
a
happy
busy
life
when
i
was
not
reciting
lessons
nor
writing
midnight
poetry
nor
selling
papers
nor
posing
nor
studying
sociology
nor
pickling
bugs
nor
interviewing
statesmen
nor
running
away
from
home
i
made
long
entries
in
nay
journal
or
wrote
letters
to
my
friends
it
was
a
happy
thing
that
poor
hutch
did
not
know
what
sums
i
spent
for
stationery
and
postage
stamps
she
would
have
gone
into
consumption
i
do
believe
from
inexpressible
indignation
and
she
would
have
been
in
the
right
to
be
indignant
not
to
go
into
consumption
i
admit
it
she
would
have
been
justified
from
her
point
of
view
from
my
point
of
view
i
was
also
in
the
right
of
course
i
was
to
make
friends
among
the
great
was
an
important
part
of
my
education
and
was
not
to
be
accomplished
without
a
liberal
expenditure
of
paper
and
postage
stamps
if
hutch
had
not
repulsed
my
offer
of
confidences
i
could
have
shown
her
long
letters
written
to
me
by
people
whose
mere
signature
was
prized
by
autograph
hunters
it
is
true
that
i
could
not
turn
those
letters
directly
into
or
if
i
could
i
would
not
but
indirectly
my
interesting
letters
did
pay
a
week
rent
now
and
then
through
the
influence
of
my
friends
my
father
sometimes
found
work
that
he
could
not
have
got
in
any
other
way
these
practical
results
of
my
costly
pursuit
of
friendships
might
have
given
hutch
confidence
in
my
ultimate
solvency
had
she
not
remained
obstinately
deaf
to
my
plea
for
time
her
heart
being
set
on
direct
immediate
convertible
cash
payment
that
was
very
even
though
i
say
it
who
should
not
the
grocer
on
harrison
avenue
who
supplied
our
table
could
have
taught
her
to
take
a
more
liberal
view
we
were
all
anxious
to
teach
her
if
she
only
would
have
listened
here
was
this
poor
grocer
conducting
his
business
on
the
same
perilous
credit
system
which
had
driven
my
father
out
of
chelsea
and
wheeler
street
supplying
us
with
tea
and
sugar
and
strong
butter
milk
freely
splashed
from
rusty
cans
potent
yeast
and
bananas
done
to
a
turn
with
everything
in
short
that
keeps
a
poor
man
family
hearty
in
spite
of
what
they
eat
and
all
this
for
the
consideration
of
part
payment
with
the
faintest
prospect
of
a
future
settlement
in
full
rosenblum
had
an
intimate
knowledge
of
the
financial
situation
of
every
family
that
traded
with
him
from
the
gossip
of
his
customers
around
his
herring
barrel
he
knew
without
asking
that
my
father
had
no
regular
employment
and
that
consequently
it
was
risky
to
give
us
credit
nevertheless
he
gave
us
credit
by
the
week
by
the
month
accepted
partial
payment
with
thanks
and
let
the
balance
stand
by
the
year
we
owed
him
as
much
as
the
landlady
i
suppose
every
time
he
balanced
our
account
but
he
never
complained
nay
he
even
insisted
on
my
mother
taking
almonds
and
raisins
for
a
cake
for
the
holidays
he
knew
as
well
as
hutch
that
my
father
kept
a
daughter
at
school
who
was
of
age
to
be
put
to
work
but
so
far
was
he
from
reproaching
him
for
it
that
he
detained
my
father
by
the
inquiring
about
my
progress
and
discussing
my
future
he
knew
very
well
did
the
poor
grocer
who
it
was
that
burned
so
much
oil
in
my
family
but
when
i
came
in
to
have
my
kerosene
can
filled
he
did
not
fall
upon
me
with
harsh
words
of
blame
instead
he
wanted
to
hear
about
my
latest
triumph
at
school
and
about
the
great
people
who
wrote
me
letters
and
even
came
to
see
me
and
he
called
his
wife
from
the
kitchen
behind
the
store
to
come
and
hear
of
these
grand
doings
rosenblum
who
could
not
sign
her
name
came
out
in
her
faded
calico
wrapper
and
stood
with
her
hands
folded
under
her
apron
shy
and
respectful
before
the
embryo
scholar
and
she
nodded
her
head
sideways
in
approval
drinking
in
with
envious
pleasure
her
husband
yiddish
version
of
my
tale
if
her
goldie
happened
to
be
playing
jackstones
on
the
curb
rosenblum
pulled
her
into
the
store
to
hear
what
distinction
antin
daughter
had
won
at
school
bidding
her
take
example
from
mary
if
she
would
also
go
far
in
education
hear
you
goldie
she
has
the
best
marks
in
everything
goldie
all
the
time
she
is
only
five
years
in
the
country
and
she
be
in
college
soon
she
beats
them
all
in
school
goldie
her
father
says
she
beats
them
all
she
studies
all
the
time
all
night
and
she
writes
it
is
a
pleasure
to
hear
she
writes
in
the
paper
goldie
you
ought
to
hear
antin
read
what
she
writes
in
the
paper
long
pieces
you
do
understand
what
he
reads
ma
goldie
interrupts
mischievously
and
i
want
to
laugh
but
i
refrain
rosenblum
does
not
fill
my
can
i
am
forced
to
stand
and
hear
myself
eulogized
not
understand
of
course
i
do
understand
how
should
i
understand
i
was
not
sent
to
school
to
learn
of
course
i
understand
but
do
understand
goldie
and
that
a
shame
if
you
would
put
your
mind
on
it
and
study
hard
like
mary
antin
you
would
also
stand
high
and
you
would
go
to
high
school
and
be
somebody
would
you
send
me
to
high
school
pa
goldie
asks
to
test
her
mother
promises
would
you
really
sure
as
i
am
a
jew
rosenblum
promptly
replies
a
look
of
aspiration
in
his
deep
eyes
only
show
yourself
worthy
goldie
and
i
keep
you
in
school
till
you
get
to
something
in
america
everybody
can
get
to
something
if
he
only
wants
to
i
would
even
send
you
farther
than
high
school
to
be
a
teacher
maybe
why
not
in
america
everything
is
possible
but
you
have
to
work
hard
goldie
like
mary
antin
study
hard
put
your
mind
on
it
oh
i
know
it
pa
goldie
exclaims
her
momentary
enthusiasm
extinguished
at
the
thought
of
long
lessons
indefinitely
prolonged
goldie
was
a
restless
little
thing
who
could
not
sit
long
over
her
geography
book
she
wriggled
out
of
her
mother
grasp
now
and
made
for
the
door
throwing
a
as
she
went
without
losing
a
single
jackstone
i
hate
long
lessons
she
said
when
i
graduate
grammar
school
next
year
i
going
to
work
in
big
store
and
get
three
dollars
a
week
and
have
lots
of
fun
with
the
girls
i
ca
write
pieces
in
the
paper
beckie
beckie
hurvich
where
you
going
wait
a
minute
i
go
along
and
she
was
off
leaving
her
ambitious
parents
to
shake
their
heads
over
her
flightiness
rosenblum
gave
me
my
oil
if
he
had
had
postage
stamps
in
stock
he
would
have
given
me
all
i
needed
and
felt
proud
to
think
that
he
was
assisting
in
my
important
correspondences
and
he
was
a
poor
man
and
had
a
large
family
and
many
customers
who
paid
as
irregularly
as
we
he
ran
the
risk
of
ruin
of
course
but
he
did
not
scold
not
us
at
any
rate
for
he
he
was
himself
an
immigrant
jew
of
the
type
that
values
education
and
sets
a
great
price
on
the
higher
development
of
the
child
he
would
have
done
in
my
father
place
just
what
my
father
was
doing
borrow
beg
go
without
run
in
debt
anything
to
secure
for
a
promising
child
the
fulfilment
of
the
promise
that
is
what
america
was
for
the
land
of
opportunity
it
was
but
opportunities
must
be
used
must
be
grasped
held
squeezed
dry
to
keep
a
child
of
working
age
in
school
was
to
invest
the
meagre
present
for
the
sake
of
the
opulent
future
if
there
was
but
one
child
in
a
family
of
twelve
who
promised
to
achieve
an
intellectual
career
the
other
eleven
and
father
and
mother
and
neighbors
must
devote
themselves
to
that
one
child
welfare
and
feed
and
clothe
and
cheer
it
on
and
be
rewarded
in
the
end
by
hearing
its
name
mentioned
with
the
names
of
the
great
so
the
poor
grocer
helped
to
keep
me
in
school
for
i
do
not
know
how
many
years
and
this
is
one
of
the
things
that
is
done
on
harrison
avenue
by
the
people
who
pitch
rubbish
through
their
windows
let
the
city
fathers
strike
the
balance
of
course
this
is
wretched
economics
if
i
had
a
son
who
wanted
to
go
into
the
grocery
business
i
should
take
care
that
he
was
well
grounded
in
the
principles
of
sound
bookkeeping
and
prudence
but
i
should
not
fail
to
tell
him
the
story
of
the
harrison
avenue
grocer
hoping
that
he
would
puzzle
out
the
moral
rosenblum
himself
would
be
astonished
to
hear
that
any
one
was
drawing
morals
from
his
manner
of
conducting
his
little
store
and
yet
it
is
from
men
like
him
that
i
learn
the
true
values
of
things
the
grocer
weighed
me
out
a
quarter
of
a
pound
of
butter
and
when
the
scales
were
even
he
threw
in
another
scrap
he
said
smiling
across
the
counter
you
can
carry
that
much
around
the
corner
plainly
he
was
showing
me
that
if
i
have
not
as
many
houses
as
my
neighbor
that
should
not
prevent
me
from
cultivating
as
many
graces
if
i
made
some
reference
to
the
unpaid
balance
rosenblum
replied
i
guess
you
not
thinking
of
running
away
from
boston
yet
you
have
finished
turning
the
libraries
inside
out
have
you
in
this
way
he
reminded
me
that
there
were
things
more
important
than
conventional
respectability
the
world
belongs
to
those
who
can
use
it
to
the
best
advantage
the
grocer
seemed
to
argue
and
i
found
that
i
had
the
courage
to
test
this
philosophy
from
my
little
room
on
dover
street
i
reached
out
for
the
world
and
the
world
came
to
me
through
books
through
the
conversation
of
noble
men
and
women
through
communion
with
the
stars
in
the
depth
of
night
i
entered
into
every
noble
chamber
of
the
palace
of
life
i
employed
no
charm
to
win
admittance
the
doors
opened
to
me
because
i
had
a
right
to
be
within
my
patent
of
nobility
was
the
longing
for
the
abundance
of
life
with
which
i
was
endowed
at
birth
and
from
the
time
i
could
toddle
unaided
i
had
been
gathering
into
my
hand
everything
that
was
fine
in
the
world
around
me
given
health
and
i
should
have
worked
out
my
salvation
even
on
a
desert
island
being
set
down
in
the
garden
of
america
where
opportunity
waits
on
ambition
i
was
bound
to
make
my
days
a
triumphal
march
toward
my
goal
the
most
unfriendly
witness
of
my
life
will
not
venture
to
deny
that
i
have
been
successful
for
aside
from
subordinate
desires
for
greatness
or
wealth
or
specific
achievement
my
chief
ambition
in
life
has
been
and
i
have
lived
a
glowing
life
has
been
mine
and
the
fires
that
blazed
highest
in
all
my
days
were
kindled
on
dover
street
i
have
never
had
a
dull
hour
in
my
life
i
have
never
had
a
livelier
time
than
in
the
slums
in
all
my
troubles
i
was
thrilled
through
and
through
with
a
prophetic
sense
of
how
they
were
to
end
a
halo
of
romance
floated
before
every
the
wings
of
future
adventures
rustled
in
the
dead
of
night
nothing
could
be
quite
common
that
touched
my
life
because
i
had
a
power
for
attracting
uncommon
things
and
when
my
noblest
dreams
shall
have
been
realized
i
shall
meet
with
nothing
finer
nothing
more
remote
from
the
commonplace
than
some
of
the
things
that
came
into
my
life
on
dover
street
friends
came
to
me
bearing
noble
gifts
of
service
inspiration
and
love
there
came
one
to
talk
with
whom
was
to
double
the
volume
of
life
she
left
roses
on
my
pillow
when
i
lay
ill
and
in
my
heart
she
planted
a
longing
for
greatness
that
i
have
yet
to
satisfy
another
came
whose
soul
was
steeped
in
sunshine
whose
eyes
saw
through
every
pretence
whose
lips
mocked
nothing
holy
and
one
came
who
carried
the
golden
key
that
unlocked
the
last
secret
chamber
of
life
for
me
friends
came
trooping
from
everywhere
and
some
were
poor
and
some
were
rich
but
all
were
devoted
and
true
and
they
left
no
niche
in
my
heart
unfilled
and
no
want
unsatisfied
to
be
alive
in
america
i
found
out
long
ago
is
to
ride
on
the
central
current
of
the
river
of
modern
life
and
to
have
a
conscious
purpose
is
to
hold
the
rudder
that
steers
the
ship
of
fate
i
was
alive
to
my
finger
tips
back
there
on
dover
street
and
all
my
girlish
purposes
served
one
main
purpose
it
would
have
been
amazing
if
i
had
stuck
in
the
mire
of
the
slum
by
every
law
of
my
nature
i
was
bound
to
soar
above
it
to
attain
the
fairer
places
that
wait
for
every
emancipated
immigrant
a
characteristic
thing
about
the
aspiring
immigrant
is
the
fact
that
he
is
not
content
to
progress
alone
solitary
success
is
imperfect
success
in
his
eyes
he
must
take
his
family
with
him
as
he
rises
so
when
i
refused
to
be
adopted
by
a
rich
old
man
and
clung
to
my
family
in
the
slums
i
was
only
following
the
rule
and
i
can
tell
it
without
boasting
because
it
is
no
more
to
my
credit
than
that
i
wake
refreshed
after
a
night
sleep
this
suggests
to
me
a
summary
of
my
virtues
through
the
exercise
of
which
i
may
be
said
to
have
attracted
my
good
fortune
i
find
that
i
have
always
given
nature
a
chance
i
have
used
my
opportunities
and
have
practised
so
much
my
enemies
will
grant
me
more
than
this
my
friends
can
not
claim
for
me
in
the
dover
street
days
i
did
not
philosophize
about
my
private
character
nor
about
the
immigrant
and
his
ways
i
lived
the
life
and
the
moral
took
care
of
itself
and
after
dover
street
came
applepie
alley
letterbox
lane
and
other
evil
corners
of
the
slums
of
boston
till
it
must
have
looked
to
our
neighbors
as
if
we
meant
to
go
on
forever
exploring
the
underworld
but
we
found
a
we
found
a
and
the
route
we
took
from
the
tenements
of
the
stifling
alleys
to
a
darling
cottage
of
our
own
where
the
sun
shines
in
at
every
window
and
the
green
grass
runs
up
to
our
very
doorstep
was
surveyed
by
the
pilgrim
fathers
who
their
field
notes
on
a
very
fine
parchment
and
called
it
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
it
was
good
to
get
out
of
dover
street
it
was
better
for
the
growing
children
better
for
my
weary
parents
better
for
all
of
us
as
the
clean
grass
is
better
than
the
dusty
pavement
but
i
must
never
forget
that
i
came
away
from
dover
street
with
my
hands
full
of
riches
i
must
not
fail
to
testify
that
in
america
a
child
of
the
slums
owns
the
land
and
all
that
is
good
in
it
all
the
beautiful
things
i
saw
belonged
to
me
if
i
wanted
to
use
them
all
the
beautiful
things
i
desired
approached
me
i
did
not
need
to
seek
my
kingdom
i
had
only
to
be
worthy
and
it
came
to
me
even
on
dover
street
everything
that
was
ever
to
happen
to
me
in
the
future
had
its
germ
or
impulse
in
the
conditions
of
my
life
on
dover
street
my
friendships
my
advantages
and
disadvantages
my
gifts
my
habits
my
ambitions
these
were
the
materials
out
of
which
i
built
my
after
life
in
the
open
workshop
of
america
my
days
in
the
slums
were
pregnant
with
possibilities
it
only
needed
the
ripeness
of
events
to
make
them
fruit
forth
in
realities
steadily
as
i
worked
to
win
america
america
advanced
to
lie
at
my
feet
i
was
an
heir

dover
street
awaiting
maturity

was
a
princess
waiting
to
be
led

chapter

the
heritage
one
of
the
inherent
disadvantages
of
premature
biography
is
that
it
can
not
go
to
the
natural
end
of
the
story
this
difficulty
threatened
me
in
the
beginning
but
now
i
find
i
do
not
need
to
tax
my
judgment
to
fix
the
proper
sudden
qualms
of
reluctance
warn
me
where
the
past
and
present
meet
i
have
reached
a
point
where
my
yesterdays
lie
in
a
quick
heap
and
i
can
not
bear
to
prod
and
turn
them
and
set
them
up
to
be
looked
at
for
that
matter
i
am
not
sure
that
i
should
add
anything
really
new
even
if
i
could
force
myself
to
cross
the
line
of
discretion
i
have
already
shown
what
a
real
thing
is
this
american
freedom
that
we
talk
about
and
in
what
manner
a
certain
class
of
aliens
make
use
of
it
anything
that
i
might
add
of
my
later
adventures
would
be
a
repetition
in
substance
of
what
i
have
already
described
having
traced
the
way
an
immigrant
child
may
take
from
the
ship
through
the
public
schools
passed
on
from
hand
to
hand
by
the
ready
teachers
through
free
libraries
and
lecture
halls
inspired
by
every
occasion
of
civic
consciousness
dragging
through
the
slums
the
weight
of
private
disadvantage
but
heartened
for
the
effort
by
public
opportunity
welcomed
at
a
hundred
open
doors
of
instruction
initiated
with
pomp
and
splendor
and
flags
unfurled
seeking
in
american
minds
the
american
way
and
finding
it
in
the
thoughts
of
the
noble
striving
against
the
odds
of
foreign
birth
and
poverty
and
winning
through
the
use
of
abundant
opportunity
a
place
as
enviable
as
that
of
any
native
child
having
traced
the
footsteps
of
the
young
immigrant
almost
to
the
college
gate
the
rest
of
the
course
may
be
left
to
the
imagination
let
us
say
that
from
the
latin
school
on
i
lived
very
much
as
my
american
schoolmates
lived
having
overcome
my
foreign
idiosyncrasies
and
the
rest
of
my
outward
adventures
you
may
read
in
any
volume
of
american
feminine
statistics
but
lest
i
be
reproached
for
a
sudden
affectation
of
reserve
after
having
trained
my
reader
to
expect
the
fullest
particulars
i
am
willing
to
add
a
few
details
i
went
to
college
as
i
proposed
though
not
to
radcliffe
receiving
an
invitation
to
live
in
new
york
that
i
did
not
like
to
refuse
i
went
to
barnard
college
instead
there
i
took
all
the
honors
that
i
deserved
and
if
i
did
not
learn
to
write
poetry
as
i
once
supposed
i
should
i
learned
at
least
to
think
in
english
without
an
accent
did
i
get
rich
you
may
want
to
know
remembering
my
ambition
to
provide
for
the
family
i
can
reply
that
i
have
earned
enough
to
pay
hutch
the
arrears
and
satisfy
all
my
wants
and
where
have
i
lived
since
i
left
the
slums
my
favorite
abode
is
a
tent
in
the
wilderness
where
i
shall
be
happy
to
serve
you
a
cup
of
tea
out
of
a
tin
kettle
and
answer
further
questions
and
is
this
really
to
be
the
last
word
yes
though
a
long
chapter
of
the
romance
of
dover
street
is
left
untold
i
could
fill
another
book
with
anecdotes
telling
how
i
took
possession
of
beacon
street
and
learned
to
distinguish
the
lord
of
the
manor
from
the
butler
in
full
dress
i
might
trace
my
steps
from
my
bare
room
overlooking
the
to
the
satin
of
the
back
bay
where
i
drank
afternoon
tea
with
gentle
ladies
whose
hands
were
as
delicate
as
their
porcelain
cups
my
journal
of
those
days
is
full
of
comments
on
the
contrasts
of
life
that
i
copied
from
my
busy
thoughts
in
the
evening
after
a
visit
to
my
aristocratic
friends
coming
straight
from
the
cushioned
refinement
of
beacon
street
where
the
maid
who
brought
my
hostess
her
slippers
spoke
in
softer
accents
than
the
finest
people
on
dover
street
i
sometimes
stumbled
over
poor
casey
lying
asleep
in
the
corridor
and
the
shock
of
the
contrast
was
like
a
searchlight
turned
suddenly
on
my
life
and
i
pondered
over
the
revelation
and
wrote
touching
poems
in
which
i
figured
as
a
heroine
of
two
worlds
i
might
quote
from
my
journals
and
poems
and
build
up
the
picture
of
that
double
life
i
might
rehearse
the
names
of
the
gracious
friends
who
admitted
me
to
their
tables
although
i
came
direct
from
the
reeking
slums
i
might
enumerate
the
priceless
gifts
they
showered
on
me
gifts
bought
not
with
gold
but
with
love
it
would
be
a
pleasant
task
to
recall
the
high
things
that
passed
in
the
gilded
over
the
afternoon
tea
it
would
add
a
splendor
to
my
simple
narrative
to
weave
in
the
portraits
of
the
distinguished
men
and
women
who
busied
themselves
with
the
humble
fortunes
of
a
and
finally
it
would
relieve
my
heart
of
a
burden
of
gratitude
to
publish
once
for
all
the
amount
of
my
indebtedness
to
the
devoted
friends
who
took
me
by
the
hand
when
i
walked
in
the
paths
of
obscurity
and
led
me
by
a
pleasanter
lane
than
i
could
have
found
by
myself
to
the
open
fields
where
obstacles
thinned
and
opportunities
crowded
to
meet
me
outside
america
i
should
hardly
be
believed
if
i
told
how
simply
in
my
experience
dover
street
merged
into
the
back
bay
these
are
matters
to
which
i
long
to
testify
but
i
must
wait
till
they
recede
into
the
past
i
can
conjure
up
no
better
symbol
of
the
genuine
practical
equality
of
all
our
citizens
than
the
hale
house
natural
history
club
which
played
an
important
part
in
my
final
emancipation
from
the
slums
for
all
i
was
regarded
as
a
plaything
by
the
serious
members
of
the
club
the
attention
and
kindness
they
lavished
on
me
had
a
deep
significance
every
one
of
those
earnest
men
and
women
unconsciously
taught
me
my
place
in
the
commonwealth
as
the
potential
equal
of
the
best
of
them
few
of
my
friends
in
the
club
it
is
true
could
have
rightly
defined
their
benevolence
toward
me
perhaps
some
of
them
thought
they
befriended
me
for
charity
sake
because
i
was
a
starved
waif
from
the
slums
some
of
them
imagined
they
enjoyed
my
society
because
i
had
much
to
say
for
myself
and
a
gay
manner
of
meeting
life
but
all
these
were
only
secondary
motives
i
myself
in
my
unclouded
perception
of
the
true
relation
of
things
that
concerned
me
could
have
told
them
all
why
they
spent
their
friendship
on
me
they
made
way
for
me
because
i
was
their
foster
sister
they
opened
their
homes
to
me
that
i
might
learn
how
good
americans
lived
in
the
least
of
their
attentions
to
me
they
cherished
the
citizen
in
the
making
the
natural
history
club
had
spent
the
day
at
nahant
studying
marine
life
in
the
tide
pools
scrambling
up
and
down
the
cliffs
with
no
thought
for
decorum
bent
only
on
securing
the
starfish
limpets
and
other
trophies
of
the
chase
there
had
been
a
merry
luncheon
on
the
rocks
with
talk
and
laughter
between
sandwiches
and
strange
jokes
intelligible
only
to
the
practising
naturalist
the
tide
had
rushed
in
at
its
proper
time
stealing
away
our
seaweed
cushions
drowning
our
transparent
pools
spouting
in
the
crevices
booming
and
hissing
and
tossing
high
the
snowy
foam
illustration
the
tide
had
rushed
in
stealing
away
our
seaweed
cushions
from
the
deck
of
the
jolly
excursion
steamer
which
was
carrying
us
home
we
had
watched
the
rosy
sun
dip
down
below
the
sea
the
members
of
the
club
grouped
in
twos
and
threes
discussed
the
successes
compared
specimens
exchanged
field
notes
or
watched
the
western
horizon
in
sympathetic
silence
it
had
been
a
great
day
for
me
i
had
seen
a
dozen
new
forms
of
life
had
caught
a
hundred
fragments
of
the
song
of
nature
by
the
sea
and
my
mind
was
seething
with
meanings
that
crowded
in
i
do
not
remember
to
which
of
my
learned
friends
i
addressed
my
questions
on
this
occasion
but
he
surely
was
one
of
the
most
learned
for
he
took
up
all
my
fragments
of
dawning
knowledge
in
his
discourse
and
welded
them
into
a
solid
structure
of
wisdom
with
windows
looking
far
down
the
past
and
a
tower
overlooking
the
future
i
was
so
absorbed
in
my
private
review
of
creation
that
i
hardly
realized
when
we
landed
or
how
we
got
into
the
electric
cars
till
we
were
a
good
way
into
the
city
at
the
public
library
i
parted
from
my
friends
and
stood
on
the
broad
stone
steps
my
jar
of
specimens
in
my
hand
watching
the
car
that
carried
them
glide
out
of
sight
my
heart
was
full
of
a
stirring
wonder
i
was
hardly
conscious
of
the
place
where
i
stood
or
of
the
day
or
the
hour
i
was
in
a
dream
and
the
familiar
world
around
me
was
transfigured
my
hair
was
damp
with
sea
spray
the
roar
of
the
tide
was
still
in
my
ears
mighty
thoughts
surged
through
my
dreams
and
i
trembled
with
understanding
i
sank
down
on
the
granite
ledge
beside
the
entrance
to
the
library
and
for
a
mere
moment
i
covered
my
eyes
with
my
hand
in
that
moment
i
had
a
vision
of
myself
the
human
creature
emerging
from
the
dim
places
where
the
torch
of
history
has
never
been
creeping
slowly
into
the
light
of
civilized
existence
pushing
more
steadily
forward
to
the
broad
plateau
of
modern
life
and
leaping
at
last
strong
and
glad
to
the
intellectual
summit
of
the
latest
century
what
an
awful
stretch
of
years
to
contemplate
what
a
weighty
past
to
carry
in
memory
how
shall
i
number
the
days
of
my
life
except
by
the
stars
of
the
night
except
by
the
salt
drops
of
the
sea
but
hark
to
the
clamor
of
the
city
all
about
this
is
my
latest
home
and
it
invites
me
to
a
glad
new
life
the
endless
ages
have
indeed
throbbed
through
my
blood
but
a
new
rhythm
dances
in
my
veins
my
spirit
is
not
tied
to
the
monumental
past
any
more
than
my
feet
were
bound
to
my
grandfather
house
below
the
hill
the
past
was
only
my
cradle
and
now
it
can
not
hold
me
because
i
am
grown
too
big
just
as
the
little
house
in
polotzk
once
my
home
has
now
become
a
toy
of
memory
as
i
move
about
at
