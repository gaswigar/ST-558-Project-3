popular

of
memphis
whose
experience
in
that
business
had
won
for
them
an
established
reputation
for
reliability
and
integrity
the
following
advertisement
appeared
in
one
of
the
morning
papers
a
few
days
after
the
conversation
above
related
the
new
and
splendid
passenger
boat
white

excursion
parties

for
the
round
trip
this
advertisement
as
might
be
expected
created
quite
a
sensation
among
the
fair
sex
of
memphis
and
added
very
greatly
to
the
cash
receipts
of
silk
merchants
and
milliner
shops
while
it
caused
a
corresponding
shrinkage
in
the
money
bags
of
doting
parents
of
marriageable
daughters
memphis
was
then
and
is
now
famous
for
the
beauty
of
her
women
and
the
muddiness
of
her
streets
cotton
bales
and
pretty
women
seem
to
be
a
spontaneous
production
in
and
about
memphis
and
in
spite
of
bad
government
and
yellow
fever
epidemics
she
is
handsome
and
lively
still
well

they
is
she
not
a
beauty
sam
never
saw
her
match

my
life
what

ago
captain
everything

put
our
best
foot
foremost
much
depends
on
first
impressions
have
you
got
plenty
of
wines
and
ice
oceans
oceans
of
all
this
conversation
occurred
on
board
of
the
white
rose
between
captain
quitman
and
samuel
brazzleman
who
were
both
rejoicing
at
the
prospect
of
a
remunerative
trip
which
was
to
begin
on
the
next
morning
before
nine
o
clock
the
dazzling
lights
in
the
long
saloon
were
streaming
down
on
the
vast
crowd
of
maskers
as
they
glided
along
through
the
mazes
of
the
dance
while
soft
sweet
sounds
floated
out
on
the
night
air
fantastic
costumes
sparkling
jewels
white
blue
and
red
plumes
rustling
silk
shining
satin
soft
velvet
sparkling
diamonds
boots
splendid
music
the
popping
of
champagne
bottles
the
hum
of
many
voices
the
merry
laughter
the
brisk
and
graceful
movement
of
charming
women
were
all
contributing
to
the
dazzling
show
all
kinds
of
costumes
were
to
be
seen
and
new
gaudy
and
plain
mary
queen
of
scots
with
her
rich
royal
costume
of
scotland
all
bedecked
with
sparkling
diamonds
was
dancing
with
ingomar
the
barbarian
chief
with
his
savage
beard
reaching
to
his
waist
and
his
all
shaded
with
gold
the
knight
of
ivanhoe
with
his
glittering
armor
on
was
dancing
with
the
first
maid
of
honor
who
wore
blue
silk
and
yellow
mask
don
quixote
the
knight
of
salamanca
dressed
in
shabby
but
quaint
armor
was
jumping
high
and
awkwardly
as
he
danced
with
the
second
maid
of
honor
who
was
a
graceful
dancer
dressed
in
silk
with
pink
mask
henry
of
navarre
with
his
black
plume
waving
high
above
the
throng
was
marching
up
and
down
the
saloon
with
the
queen
of
sheba
leaning
on
his
arm
sancho
panza
with
his
clownish
costume
was
playing
the
clown
to
perfection
to
the
great
amusement
of
the
children
the
duke
of
wellington
and
napoleon
were
taking
a
mint
julep
at
the
bar
while
george
iii
was
quarreling
with
sam
brazzleman
because
he
wouldn
t
tell
him
the
name
of
the
lady
who
represented
the
queen
of
scots
positively
against
our
rules
to
divulge
the
names
of
parties
in
mask
without
their
consent
says
sam
well
does
she
reside
in
memphis
can
t
answer
i
tell
you
it
is
contrary
to
is
she
going
to
new
orleans
on
this
boat
good
i
ll
find
out
who
she
is
if
i
follow
her
to
the
other
side
of
the
world
and
the
imitator
of
the
defunct
tyrant
made
his
way
to
where
the
mysterious
queen
stood
conversing
with
her
barbarian
chief
who
is
that
lady
dancing
with
ingomar
inquired
george
iii
of
ivanhoe
do
not
know
wish
i
i
ll
give
a
hundred
dollars
to
know
who
she
i
ll
go
you
halves
says
ivanhoe
george
iii
and
ivanhoe
were
not
the
only
ones
who
wanted
to
know
who
was
personating
the
scottish
queen
it
seemed
to
be
a
general
desire
among
the
male
maskers
to
know
who
she
was
it
is
hard
to
say
what
caused
this
general
wish
to
know
who
she
was
it
might
have
been
caused
by
a
combination
of
circumstances
there
appeared
to
be
a
desire
on
the
part
of
the
gentlemen
to
get
near
her
was
it
the
soft
sweet
melody
of
her
voice
or
was
it
the
grace
of
her
movements
perhaps
it
was
the
profusion
of
golden
hair
that
fell
unconfined
beneath
the
quaint
crown
of
sparkling
jewels
that
graced
her
brow
or
it
may
have
been
the
little
provoking
pretty
foot
that
now
and
then
made
its
appearance
as
she
floated
like
a
fairy
over
the
floor
when
she
took
her
seat
at
the
piano
and
began
to
sing
while
the
rich
sweet
voice
rose
until
the
saloon
seemed
to
be
filled
with
music
curiosity
went
up
to
fever
heat
and
george
iii
would
have
given
his
kingdom
to
know
who
she
was
ingomar
the
barbarian
chief
with
his
long
shaggy
whiskers
stood
near
the
queen
turning
the
music
sheets
as
the
song
progressed
and
occasionally
stooping
to
whisper
something
in
her
ear
which
she
answered
with
a
nod
and
a
smile
as
soon
as
the
song
was
ended
the
knight
of
ivanhoe
requested
ingomar
to
present
him
to
the
queen
ingomar
in
a
low
whisper
asked
her
permission
to
present
the
knight
of
ivanhoe
which
was
promptly
granted
i
have
the
honor
your
majesty
to
present
my
distinguished
and
honorable
friend
sir
knight
of
a
graceful
bow
and
the
queen
held
out
her
little
white
hand
which
ivanhoe
pressed
to
his
lips
sir
knight
we
are
delighted
to
know
you
shall
we
have
the
pleasure
of
your
presence
during
our
excursion
to
new
orleans
i
am
profoundly
grateful
for
your
majesty
s
condescension
and
shall
be
overjoyed
at
the
privilege
of
making
one
of
the
being
the
first
day
of
may
our
festivities
will
commence
and
it
is
our
royal
pleasure
sir
knight
that
you
shall
attach
yourself
to
our
court
during
the
i
can
not
find
language
my
dear
madame
to
express
my
gratitude
for
the
distinguished
honor
you
confer
upon
partners
for
a
quadrille
rang
through
the
saloon
as
the
band
struck
up
a
lively
tune
george
the
duke
of
wellington
and
napoleon
all
made
a
dash
toward
the
queen
at
once
each
one
anxious
to
secure
her
as
a
partner
but
with
a
low
bow
and
a
sweet
smile
she
turned
to
ivanhoe
took
his
arm
and
was
soon
gliding
through
the
dance
the
british
king
appeared
to
take
his
discomfiture
rather
hard
while
wellington
looked
somewhat
but
napoleon
proposed
that
their
sorrow
should
all
be
drowned
in
a
bowl
of
punch
which
was
agreed
to
and
the
trio
marched
to
the
bar
to
commence
the
drowning
process
devilish
provoking
muttered
george
iii
what
s
provoking
says
wellington
that
mysterious
piece
of
humanity
styling
herself
queen
of
scots
i
shall
always
hate
masquerade
balls
after
this
i
don
t
think
they
are
respectable
at
come
come
your
royal
highness
you
should
not
surrender
at
the
first
repulse
ivanhoe
has
only
gained
a
temporary
triumph
and
if
you
will
come
to
the
charge
again
with
a
brave
heart
you
may
yet
compel
victory
to
perch
on
your
ingomar
had
a
monopoly
until
ivanhoe
leaped
into
the
arena
and
carried
off
the
prize
and
i
advise
you
to
show
a
bold
front
strategy
won
t
win
in
battles
of
love
if
you
expect
to
win
don
t
attempt
to
make
a
flank
movement
but
come
boldly
up
to
the
front
remember
that
faint
heart
never
won
fair
i
don
t
want
to
win
a
fair
lady
or
any
other
kind
of
lady
until
i
know
who
she
i
guess
you
will
find
that
out
for
she
is
going
to
new
true
but
i
learn
that
she
means
to
make
the
entire
trip
impossible
sir
impossible
how
can
she
remain
on
this
boat
two
or
three
weeks
without
being
recognized
by
some
one
that
s
the
question
to
be
settled
hereafter
she
will
have
to
play
the
game
very
cautiously
if
she
prevents
me
from
finding
out
who
she
is
by
the
by
do
you
know
who
that
fellow
is
who
personates
ingomar
no
but
you
may
be
sure
the
queen
knows
him
did
you
notice
how
affectionately
she
leans
on
his
arm
and
how
close
she
puts
her
mouth
to
his
ear
when
she
speaks
to
him
yes
to
be
sure
i
did
but
she
is
now
playing
the
same
game
on
who
the
deuce
is
ivanhoe
i
don
t
know
that
either
and
without
meaning
any
discourtesy
to
you
i
beg
to
say
that
i
don
t
care
a
copper
to
know
who
he
i
hear
that
it
is
the
intention
of
ingomar
and
ivanhoe
to
imitate
the
example
of
the
queen
by
making
the
trip
by
all
means
let
them
do
it
and
i
suggest
that
we
three
do
the
same
and
keep
our
names
concealed
from
them
and
we
shall
have
rare
sport
don
t
you
know
that
the
ladies
will
die
of
curiosity
if
we
conceal
our
names
let
us
form
a
combination
against
them
look
and
talk
mysteriously
and
my
word
for
it
propositions
will
be
made
for
a
treaty
looking
to
a
general
disclosure
of
names
and
the
discarding
of
capital
idea
my
lord
and
you
may
depend
upon
my
hearty
as
soon
as
the
boat
leaves
the
wharf
let
the
war
perhaps
the
captain
will
object
to
passengers
going
in
disguise
all
the
no
he
told
me
that
the
queen
intended
to
make
the
entire
trip
in
mask
and
that
the
same
privilege
would
be
extended
to
all
who
desired
to
avail
themselves
of
very
good
very
good
then
the
alliance
offensive
and
defensive
may
be
considered
as
ratified
and
charge
chester
charge
and
on
stanley
on
said
wellington
as
he
drew
the
cork
from
a
fresh
bottle
of
champagne
screw
your
courage
up
to
the
sticking
point
my
gallant
king
and
with
the
emperor
and
duke
at
your
back
move
on
the
enemy
unfurl
your
banner
cry
havoc
and
let
slip
the
dogs
of
war
confusion
and
discomfiture
shall
overwhelm
our
we
must
win
the
queen
of
sheba
to
our
side
at
all
hazards
as
i
learn
that
she
and
her
two
maids
of
honor
are
going
on
the
that
shall
be
your
task
then
to
secure
her
see
her
at
once
and
if
she
will
join
us
we
will
have
an
easy
you
may
depend
on
me
for
that
said
the
counterfeit
king
as
he
started
on
his
recruiting
expedition
i
ll
be
back
in
a
moment
and
report
progress
meantime
you
and
napoleon
mature
the
plan
of
the
campaign
during
my
george
iii

returned
with
a
favorable
report
her
majesty
presents
her
compliments
to
the
emperor
and
my
lord
the
duke
of
wellington
and
will
be
much
gratified
to
have
them
enrolled
as
permanent
members
of
her
festive
court
which
will
be
convened
on
the
hurricane
deck

now
you
have
her
message
said
the
king
as
he
dove
both
hands
into
his
pockets
with
a
look
won
t
we
have
rare
sport
won
t
we
make
the
enemy
die
of
curiosity
we
must
organize
thoroughly
and
make
a
systematic
siege
and
if
we
don
t
capture
the
entire
party
before
three
days
take
my
hat
and
hang
it
on
the
tallest
wave
that
rises
behind
the
white
rose
of
we
must
seem
to
ignore
the
other
party
entirely
look
and
talk
as
if
no
such
party
were
aboard
drop
mysterious
hints
about
things
that
never
were
heard
of
speak
of
that
we
could
tell
more
about
if
we
would
let
all
these
hints
be
carelessly
dropped
in
the
hearing
of
some
one
of
the
other
party
and
you
may
be
sure
that
they
will
sue
for
peace
and
union
before
we
reach
new
orleans
should
any
one
of
the
other
party
ask
questions
which
they
will
be
sure
to
do

your
head

mysterious
shrug
your
shoulders
and
heave
a
mournful
sigh

you
think
the
world
ever
produced
a
woman
that
could
stand
that

the
queen
of

of

now
half
dead

how
she

me
for
the

hour

her
as

enemies
at

the
ball
ended
the
guests
departed
save
those
who
had
engaged
passage
for
the
grand
excursion
and
they
had
retired
for
the
night
to
dream
of
the
sport
to
be
enjoyed
on
the
morrow
while

quitman
paced
proudly
on
the

the
eventful
and
day
on
which
the
white
rose
of
memphis
was
to
start
on
her
first
trip
had
come
at
last
and
a
mighty
stir
indeed
did
that
day
produce
on
and
under
the
tall
romantic
bluff
in
front
of
memphis
the
morning
was
delightful
the
atmosphere
pure
and
invigorating
the
sweet
odor
of
fresh
spring
flowers
was
on
the
breeze
mingling
with
the
soft
notes
of
music
produced
by
the
band
from
the
hurricane
deck
the
stars
and
stripes
floated
gracefully
from
the
dark
clouds
of
black
smoke
rose
from
the
chimneys
a
white
cloud
of
steam
struggled
up
through
the
black
smoke
and
disappeared
far
above
innumerable
drays
rattled
along
the
pavement
carriages
thundered
over
the
rocky
road
carriage
drivers
swore
at
dray

returned
the

boys
danced
juber
darted
hither
and
thither
apparently
anxious
to
perform
their
duty
without
the
slightest
conception
of
what
that
duty
was
a
villainous
urchin
in
the
arms
of
his
nurse
was
making
a
noise
with
a
tin
horn
and
a
passenger
muttered
something
not
taught
at
them
s
my
sentiments
to
a
t
said
another
man
who
had
been
annoyed
with
the
tin
horn
as
the
hour
drew
near
when
the
boat
was
to
start
the
confusion
increased
the
pilot
was
at
his
wheel
the
engineer
was
at
his
engine
captain
quitman
stood
on
the
upper
deck
in
front
of
the
pilot
house
looking
happy
and
feeling
vastly
important
hundreds
of
men
women
and
children
in
holiday
costumes
stood
on
the
bluff
shouting
and
waving
white
handkerchiefs
to
their
friends
on
the
boat
a
in
a
cage
on
the
boiler
deck
imitated
every
imaginable
sound
with
his
wonderful
voice
while
a
parrot
perched
on
a
pole
near
the
clerk
s
office
kept
crying
let
her
rip
let
her
rip
sam
how
much
steam
have
you
got
tom
cried
the
pilot
through
his
one
sixty
sir
and
still
all
right
blow
off
the
mud
valves
and
keep
a
good
head
we
must
make
a
good
run
at
the
time
s
up
dave
let
her
go
said
the
captain
run
her
up
to
the
mouth
of
wolf
make
a
turn
to
the
left
and
then
let
her
come
down
with
her
best
let
go

cried
the
mate
draw
in
the
stage

the

on

larboard
and
back
on
the
starboard
cried
the
pilot
to
the
engineer
go
ahead
on
the
steward
and
back
on
the
cries
a
mischievous
little
negro
who
is
dancing
a
jig
in
front
of
the
pilot
house
the
boat
moves
slowly
up
stream
until
a
point
opposite
the
mouth
of
wolf
river
is
reached
then
makes
a
graceful
curve
to
the
left
and
comes
flying
past
the
city
with
a
speed
never
equaled
by
any
other
boat
on
that
river
as
the
white
rose
passed
the
last
crowd
on
the
bluff
a
tremendous
shout
rose
from
a
thousand
voices
which
was
answered
by
the
throng
of
passengers
who
lined
the
deck
of
the
boat
as
the
golden
rays
of
the
morning
sun
glanced
down
against
the
side
of
the
boat
and
played
and
danced
with
the
painted
glass
of
her
cabin
a
thousand
dazzling
streaks
of
light
flashed
back
presenting
a
sight
of
indescribable
beauty
it
was
but
a
few
moments
until
the
boat
passed
round
the
bend
below
president
s
island
and
shut
off
from
view
the
tall
domes
of
the
bluff
city
but
the
fresh
green
foliage
with
which
the
tall
trees
were
clothed
presented
a
scene
of
beauty
on
which
the
beholders
gazed
with
delight
as
might
have
been
expected
quite
a
sensation
was
created
among
the
large
crowd
of
passengers
when
a
dozen
or
more
men
and
women
appeared
on
deck
disguised
with
as
many
different
and
curious
costumes
a
murmur
of
dissatisfaction
rose
among
some
of
the
passengers
which
threatened
to
produce
trouble
but
finally
it
subsided
when
the
clerk
announced
the
fact
that
all
the
maskers
were
well
known
to
him
and
that
they
were
respectable
people
how
is
your
royal
highness
this
morning
said
the
duke
of
wellington
as
he
shook
hands
with
george

us
commence
the
siege
at
once
i
see
her
majesty
the
queen
of
sheba
and
her
attendants
are
waiting
for
us
the
scottish
queen
has
marshaled
her
forces
on
the
hurricane
how
is
that
demanded
the
emperor
they
have
all
taken
seats
in
a
circle
and
seem
determined
to
continue
the
selfish
plan
now
we
will
take
seats
at
a
respectable
distance
from
them
just
so
as
to
be
in
hearing
distance
and
begin
the
battle
according
to
our
original
plan
our
object
is
to
so
rouse
their
curiosity
as
to
force
them
to
come
to
our
side
or
in
other
words
to
induce
them
to
come
and
mingle
with
us
a
little
skillful
maneuvering
on
our
part
and
the
victory
is
lead

my
gallant
king
you
shall
be
our
commander
in
this
fight

the
queen
of
sheba
to
the
field
and
the
emperor
and
i
will
bring
up
the
maids
of
honor
and
then
let
the
skirmishing
a
canvas
had
been
put
up
above
the
hurricane
deck
and
seats
arranged
under
it
in
order
to
afford
passengers
an
opportunity
to
view
the
grand
scenery
without
being
exposed
to
the
rays
of
the
sun
and
this
spot
had
been
selected
as
the
field
of
action
the
queen
of
scots
and
her
party
were
seated
in
a
circle
near
the
stern
of
the
boat
wholly
unconscious
of
the
hostile
preparations
which
were
being
made
by
the
queen
of
sheba
and
her
adherents
ingomar
was
entertaining
the
queen
and
the
ladies
of
her
court
with
an
eloquent
description
of
the
burning
of
the
bulletin
and
the
scenes
that
were
witnessed
on
that
occasion
the
queen
of
sheba
with
her
party
was
located
about
twenty
feet
from
the
spot
occupied
by
the
queen
of
scots
now
said
george
making
a
low
bow
to
the
queen
of
sheba
what
is
your
majesty
s
pleasure
what
is
to
be
the
fun
social
conversation
and
enjoying
the
beautiful
scenery
will
occupy
us
till
luncheon
and
when
we
have
had
enough
of
that
we
will
then
form
our
plans
for
the
by
the
by
said
wellington
with
a
loud
voice
evidently
intended
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
scottish
queen
s
party
have
you
heard
the
strange
news
no
no
what
is
it
there
are
two
detectives
aboard
in
mask
on
the
for
the
perpetrator
of
a
diabolical
murder
that
was
committed
near
collierville
day
before
yesterday
they
have
tracked
the
man
to
this
boat
and
have
satisfied
themselves
that
he
is
aboard
and
are
prepared
to
arrest
him
they
have
got
a
man
spotted
and
are
going
to
take
him
off
at
that
s
the
best
shot
that
ever
was
fired
whispered
napoleon
see
said
the
queen
the
shot
has
taken
effect
they
are
all
looking
this
way
and
intently
listening
they
are
dying
to
hear
more
give
them
another
what
were
the
circumstances
of
the
murder
inquired
napoleon
as
he
raised
his
voice
and
winked
at
wellington
oh
it
was
a
most
horrible
and
cruel
murder
it
was
a
love
affair
the
deceased
was
a
young
and
pretty
girl
she
had
loved
not
wisely
but
too
well
poison
was
the
means
used
to
produce
there
there
wellington
whispered
napoleon
let
em
rest
on
that
a
while
they
have
all
been
gradually
moving
this
way
they
can
t
hold
out
much
let
me
throw
one
more
shell
into
their
camp
whispered
wellington
all
right
go
there
is
a
skillful
pickpocket
aboard
of
this
boat
and
those
who
have
money
had
better
be
on
their
guard
one
passenger
has
been
relieved
of
a
purse
containing
five
hundred
dollars
the
pocket
was
cut
clean
off
and
so
skillfully
done
that
the
owner
knew
nothing
about
it
until
his
attention
was
called
to
it
by
a
friend
i
fear
that
our
amusements
will
all
be
interfered
with
and
that
we
shall
be
compelled
to
lay
aside
our
disguises
because
whoever
he
is
you
may
be
assured
he
is
in
good
good
wellington
said
george
in
a
whisper
stop
you
have
got
them
completely
demoralized
and
we
may
safely
wait
for
the
oh
mercy
on
us
exclaimed
one
of
queen
mary
s
maids
of
honor
we
are
in
the
midst
of
thieves
and
murderers
didn
t
you
hear
that
gentleman
say
that
a
bloody
murder
had
been
committed
and
that
a
gentleman
had
been
robbed
and
that
both
criminals
were
aboard
of
this
boat
who
knows
but
what
we
shall
all
be
murdered
and
robbed
don
t
look
toward
them
said
wellington
the
last
shot
has
mortally
wounded
the
last
one
of
the
this
sentence
was
whispered
so
as
not
to
be
heard
by
the
opposition
ivanhoe
drew
near
wellington
and
said
pardon
me
sir
but
i
beg
to
inquire
about
this
dreadful
murder
of
which
i
heard
you
speak
just
wellington
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
gave
a
deep
sigh
horrible
horrible
must
cruel
unprecedented
but
that
s
all
i
know
about
and
with
a
knowing
wink
at
george
wellington
observed
look
at
that
beautiful
little
island
there
see
what
delightful
foliage
how
splendid
it
would
be
to
have
a
picnic
on
that
nice
green
turf
under
such
a
shade
oh
wouldn
t
that
be
delightful
said
the
queen
of
sheba
we
ll
have
a
picnic
said
napoleon
the
boat
is
going
to
take
on
a
large
lot
of
cotton
just
below
helena
and
we
will
order
the
steward
to
prepare
a
picnic
dinner
and
we
will
have
a
dance
as
well
as
a
ivanhoe
bit
his
lip
with
vexation
as
he
returned
to
his
party
no
wiser
than
when
he
left
it
hold
your
hand
over
my
mouth
else
i
shall
be
compelled
to
laugh
out
said
the
queen
to
her
first
maid
of
honor
pray
don
t
laugh
cried
the
young
lady
it
would
cause
them
to
suspect
what
did
you
learn
about
the
murder
inquired
the
queen
of
scots
as
ivanhoe
returned
to
his
seat
nothing
was
the
solemn
reply
they
all
seem
to
be
an
ungenteel
crew
and
for
my
part
i
am
inclined
to
think
they
have
been
making
sport
of
i
see
through
it
all
said
ingomar
gravely
they
are
offended
because
we
did
not
invite
them
to
mingle
with
us
for
my
part
i
am
unwilling
to
notice
such
silly
conduct
i
like
amusement
well
enough
but
it
must
be
such
as
sensible
people
may
engage
in
allow
me
to
suggest
that
we
move
to
another
place
and
inaugurate
a
regular
systematic
plan
to
while
away
our
idle
the
suggestion
was
unanimously
concurred
in
and
the
entire
party
went
to
the
front
end
of
the
boat
and
soon
were
seated
leaving
the
other
party
overwhelmed
with
mortification
that
is
too
bad
exclaimed
napoleon
we
had
won
the
victory
and
lost
it
by
all
grinning
at
once
they
have
evidently
seen
our
hand
and
we
have
lost
the
suppose
we
invite
the
other
party
to
join
us
said
ingomar
if
we
expect
to
enjoy
our
trip
it
would
be
advisable
to
dispense
with
the
rigid
rules
of
decorum
and
become
acquainted
with
each
your
sentiments
are
generous
and
noble
sir
and
are
heartily
approved
and
with
your
permission
i
will
invite
the
other
party
to
join
have
i
your
permission
madame
to
deliver
the
invitation
yes
and
i
trust
it
will
be
ingomar
approached
the
spot
where
the
queen
of
sheba
and
her
party
were
seated
and
with
a
dignified
bow
said
i
am
requested
by
my
royal
mistress
the
queen
of
scots
to
present
her
highest
regards
to
your
majesty
and
request
the
pleasure
of
your
company
at
her
royal
court
she
further
requests
me
to
beg
you
to
bring
all
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
your
party
with
you
in
order
that
a
friendly
union
may
be
entered
into
for
the
better
enjoyment
of
such
festivities
and
pleasures
as
may
be
jointly
considered
worthy
of
and
intelligent
right
noble
and
worthy
chief
most
eloquently
hast
thou
delivered
the
message
of
thy
royal
mistress
and
it
would
be
extreme
rudeness
for
us
to
refuse
to
accept
it
therefore
we
request
you
to
convey
to
her
majesty
our
most
distinguished
regards
and
inform
her
that
her
generous
offer
is
accepted
and
that
it
will
be
our
pleasure
to
visit
her
festive
my
royal
mistress
will
be
delighted
with
the
and
as
he
said
this
he
raised
the
queen
s
hand
to
his
lips
then
turned
and
delivered
his
message
to
the
queen
of
scots
i
am
going
to
laugh
said
the
first
maid
laugh
as
much
as
you
please
now
it
can
do
no
harm
we
are
forever
disgraced
we
are
beaten
overcome
captured
said
wellington
as
he
clinched
his
fists
with
vexation
is
this
the
victory
that
we
have
been
fighting
for
i
call
it
a
complete
victory
said
the
queen
was
it
not
the
object
of
our
plan
to
force
them
to
invite
us
to
join
them
and
have
they
not
yielded
you
may
be
sure
they
would
never
have
given
us
the
invitation
had
it
not
been
for
the
bait
which
we
threw
out
to
i
agree
with
your
majesty
there
said
george
iii
we
have
accomplished
the
object
for
which
we
contended
and
now
let
us
join
their
party
and
make
ourselves
be
it
so
then
replied
wellington
as
he
offered
his
arm
to
the
queen
and
led
her
to
where
the
other
party
were
seated
the
two
queens
seemed
to
enter
into
a
contest
as
to
which
should
be
considered
most
polite
the
graceful
bowing
the
gentle
the
sweet
smiling
the
high
compliments
and
general
bearing
were
such
as
might
have
been
witnessed
between
queen
victoria
and
the
empress
eugenie
when
they
first
met
now
said
ingomar
addressing
the
two
queens
as
i
understand
the
object
of
this
excursion
to
be
one
of
pleasure
and
amusement
permit
me
to
suggest
that
we
organize
ourselves
into
a
sort
of
committee
of
the
whole
and
agree
on
some
plan
by
which
each
hour
of
the

desirous
of

much
as

they
expect

adoption
all
who
favor
the
rules
make
it
known
by
saying
aye
it
is
unnecessary
to
call
for

nays
as
the
vote
is
unanimous
in
the
affirmative
and
the
rules
are
well
said
ingomar
your
majesty
will
issue
your
commands
for
the
day
what
shall
be
the
programme
it
is
our
royal
pleasure
that
each
member
of
the
association
shall
be
required
to
relate
a
story
consisting
of
events
the
truth
of
which
are
to
be
vouched
for
by
the
narrator
i
dare
say
that
each
one
will
be
able
to
tell
something
that
will
be
both
amusing
and
instructive
love
stories
would
be
preferable
but
no
one
shall
be
restricted
as
to
that
personal
reminiscences
of
the
party
who
may
tell
the
story
would
be
listened
to
doubtless
with
attention
and
pleasure
therefore
it
is
our
royal
command
that
the
barbarian
chief
ingomar
shall
now
proceed
to
relate
a
ingomar
ingomar
ingomar
a
story
by
ingomar
cried
every
one
it
would
have
been
more
to
my
liking
to
have
listened
to
others
may
it
pleasure
your
majesty
but
as
it
would
be
rank
treason
to
disobey
your
command
i
shall
endeavor
to
comply
by
relating
the
history
of
transactions
many
of
which
came
under
my
own
observation
in
and
near
the
city
of
memphis
the
substance
of
the
story
would
no
doubt
be
very
interesting
were
it
well
told
but
i
greatly
fear
i
shall
bore
you
all
by
my
awkward
manner
of
telling
it
but
there
will
be
a
consolation
in
knowing
that
if
you
should
become
wearied
of
it
you
can
command
me
to
stop
which
order
i
beg
to
assure
you
i
would
more
gladly
obey
than
any
other
you
could
if
your
manner
of
telling
the
story
is
as
modest
and
well
spoken
as
the
apology
we
shall
be
very
much
delighted
i
assure
you
therefore
we
command
you
to
as
the
occurrences
which
i
am
about
to
describe
all
have
an
intimate
connection
with
the
city
of
memphis
and
as
many
of
the
persons
who
played
prominent
parts
in
the
story
are
now
residing
there
i
think
it
proper
to
inform
my
audience
that
the
names
used
are
fictitious
i
could
not
for
a
moment
think
of
parading
the
real
names
of
the
actors
before
the
public
without
their
the
idea
is
commendable
sir
and
only
serves
to
increase
our
anxiety
to
hear
the
story
therefore
we
again
command
you
to
there
s
the
gong
for
luncheon
cried
napoleon
as
he
sprang
to
his
feet
postpone
the
story
until
after
that
s
a
splendid
idea
said
ingomar
it
will
give
me
time
to
collect
my
very
well
said
the
queen
we
will
assemble
here
immediately
after
lunch
to
listen
to
ingomar
s
ingomar
led
the
queen
of
scots
to
the
saloon
while
wellington
offered
his
arm
to
the
queen
of
sheba
and
the
party
went
down
to
lunch
chapter
iii
the
arrangements
which
captain
quitman
had
made
for
the
accommodation
of
the
large
party
of
excursionists
were
of
the
most
costly
and
liberal
character
showing
that
neither
labor
nor
money
had
been
stingily
expended
the
spacious
saloon
had
been
gorgeously
decorated
by
an
experienced
artist
while
innumerable
historical
incidents
and
poetical
scenes
had
been
painted
on
the
surface
of
the
wall
in
front
of
each
three
scenes
in
mazeppa
appeared
first
on
the
left
as
you
entered
from
the
front
the
first
picture
represented
the
beautiful
wild
steed
in
the
act
of
making
a
plunge
forward
while
mazeppa
is
being
bound
to
his
back
the
second
scene
represented
the
foaming
steed
as
he
bounded
through
the
forest
with
the
large
gang
of
wolves
in
pursuit
and
the
last
showed
the
dying
steed
stretched
on
the
ground
while
a
flock
of
vultures
covered
the
surrounding
space
ready
to
begin
the
work
of
destruction
the
artist
had
executed
the
work
so
skillfully
that
one
might
almost
imagine
that
he
could
hear
the
horse
s
hoofs
as
they
thundered
against
the
earth
and
distinguish
the
hideous
howl
of
the
savage
wolves
the
next
painting
represented
achilles
driving
his
chariot
round
the
walls
of
troy
dragging
the
helpless
body
of
hector
by
the
heels
while
the
beauteous
wife
of
the
dead
hero
stood
weeping
on
a
distant
tower
as
she
witnessed
the
horrible
cruelty
then
a
little
farther
down
on
the
same
side
we
see
cleopatra
seated
in
her
magnificent
gondola
gorgeously
clad
in
her
royal
robes
surrounded
by
her
officers
and
slaves
while
she
sails
over
the
glittering
surface
of
the
water
where
she
goes
to
conquer
a
mighty
warrior
with
her
irresistible
charms
we
come
next
to
a
ludicrous
scene
representing
gulliver
on
the
island
of
lilliput
standing
erect
with
his
legs
placed
far
apart
while
twenty
thousand
lilliputian
cavalry
with
the
king
and
queen
at
their
head
are
marching
between
his
huge
legs
a
beautiful
representation
of
the
burial
of
de
soto
in
the
mississippi
river
appeared
farther
on
many
other
thrilling
scenes
appeared
which
we
can
not
spare
time
to
describe
so
the
guests
marched
into
the
spacious
saloon
professor
scatterbrains
s
band
played
a
national
air
the
soft
sweet
sounds
filling
the
room
with
a
delightful
harmony
the
gorgeous
display
of
costly
that
adorned
the
festive
board
was
such
as
one
might
expect
to
behold
at
a
king
s
palace
massive
goblets
of
solid
silver
tureens
pitchers
castors
and
fruit
stands
of
shining
gold
large
china
vases
filled
with
fragrant
flowers
arranged
in
pairs
from
one
end
of
the
table
to
the
other
while
gilded
china
imported
from
the
east
of
various
colors
green
yellow
and
blue
wrought
in
quaint
but
beautiful
patterns
covered
the
cloth
two
beautiful
thrones
for
the
especial
use
of
the
two
queens
had
been
erected
at
the
head
of
the
table
one
on
the
left
the
other
on
the
right
handsomely
decorated
with
pink
velvet
cushions
and
canopied
with
blue
cloth
richly
studded
with
stars
of
silver
and
gold
the
charming
picture
that
met
the
eyes
of
the
delighted
guests
caused
an
exclamation
of
delight
to
escape
from
the
lips
of
many
a
beautiful
belle
as
they
filed
into
the
saloon
as
soon
as
all
the
passengers
were
seated
the
captain
waving
his
hand
toward
the
vast
crowd
by
way
of
commanding
silence
said
my
young
friends
if
you
wish
to
please
me
and
enjoy
this
excursion
i
hope
you
will
lay
aside
all
feelings
of
restraint
become
acquainted
with
each
other
and
engage
in
such
innocent
sport
as
is
calculated
to
amuse
and
instruct
julius
cæsar
said
let
me
have
men
about
me
that
are
fat
men
who
sleep
o
nights
yon
d
cassius
has
a
lean
and
hungry
look
he
thinks
too
much
such
men
are
now
my
young
friends
the
sequel
proved
that
cæsar
was
right
in
his
dislike
of
the
lean
and
hungry
cassius
give
me
friends
who
laugh
and
grow
fat
men
and
women
who
can
throw
off
the
dull
cares
of
life
and
condescend
to
be
pleasant
and
happy
on
occasions
like
this
there
are
times
when
man
should
be
serious
but
there
are
also
times
when
he
should
be
social
and
sportive
i
have
spent
money
and
labor
freely
in
order
to
complete
the
arrangements
for
the
comfort
and
pleasure
of
my
guests
and
it
will
gratify
me
greatly
to
know
that
i
have
not
made
a
failure
i
was
gratified
when
i
heard
of
the
admirable
plans
which
your
majesty
has
adopted
in
order
to
amuse
and
entertain
your
loving
subjects
indeed
sir
i
am
delighted
to
know
that
our
little
scheme
meets
with
your
approbation
we
thought
it
would
afford
innocent
amusement
as
well
as
profitable
food
for
thought
the
barbarian
chief
has
kindly
consented
to
entertain
our
party
by
the
relation
of
a
story
which
is
to
be
the
first
of
a
series
to
be
told
during
our
i
hope
said
scottie
that
the
noble
barbarian
chief
will
tell
us
all
about
parthenia
the
beauteous
little
captive
whose
irresistible
charm
subdued
and
tamed
ingomar
and
led
him
with
the
rosy
chain
of
love
from
the
barbarian
camp
to
the
walks
of
civilization
converting
a
heartless
savage
into
a
fond
and
gentle
lover
oh
how
i
should
like
to
capture
such
a
hero
it
would
be
such
fun
to
tease
him
until
he
began
to
rave
and
then
to
soothe
him
with
sweet
whispers
from
the
soul
i
would
make
him
gather
flowers
for
me
and
then
talk
to
him
about
two
souls
with
but
a
single
thought
two
hearts
that
beat
as
one
and
i
would
enjoy
such
sport
so
much
for
my
part
said
the
queen
of
sheba
i
would
much
prefer
to
listen
to
a
patriotic
story
such
as
the
scottish
chiefs
or
thaddæus
of
warsaw
i
admire
those
heroes
who
are
always
willing
to
die
for
their
country
but
manage
somehow
not
to
do
it
the
heroic
thaddæus
of
warsaw
was
very
anxious
to
sacrifice
himself
for
his
country
but
finally
took
a
more
sensible
view
of
it
and
fled
to
england
and
married
mary
buford
the
great
i
prefer
love
stories
replied
scottie
give
us
something
like
henrietta
temple
alonzo
and
melissa
foul
play
or
little
i
prefer
gulliver
or
crusoe
said
george
iii
i
do
not
think
i
could
command
sufficient
patience
to
listen
to
such
a
love
story
as
henrietta
give
me
something
like
the
talisman
or
the
heart
of
midlothian
and
you
may
count
on
securing
my
undivided
attention
said
ivanhoe
permit
me
to
make
a
suggestion
to
my
young
friends
observed
captain
quitman
which
i
have
no
doubt
will
contribute
greatly
to
your
pleasure
we
have
a
young
gentleman
aboard
whom
i
consider
an
excellent
shakespearean
reader
i
had
the
exquisite
pleasure
of
hearing
his
rendition
of
hamlet
one
evening
at
a
social
gathering
in
memphis
and
i
have
no
doubt
he
would
consent
to
gratify
his
friends
by
repeating
it
we
would
be
more
than
delighted
if
you
could
prevail
on
him
to
give
us
an
entertainment
of
that
sort
this
evening
rejoined
queen
mary
if
we
can
be
so
fortunate
as
to
organize
a
troupe
of
poetical
readers
observed
the
duke
of
wellington
it
would
instruct
as
well
as
amuse
our
friends
if
such
a
scheme
should
be
desirable
and
i
am
pleased
to
think
it
would
i
can
produce
a
young
lady
who
can
repeat
lalla
rookh
from
memory
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
there
are
many
others
aboard
who
could
give
us
some
excellent
readings
of
we
commission
the
duke
and
captain
quitman
as
our
agents
to
organize
a
troupe
rejoined
queen
mary
and
our
programme
will
be
to
listen
to
ingomar
s
story
this
evening
and
at
night
to
assemble
in
the
saloon
and
hear
the
i
shall
not
be
able
to
complete
the
relation
of
my
story
this
evening
said
ingomar
that
will
make
no
difference
replied
the
queen
we
will
be
entertained
by
our
barbarian
chief
during
the
day
and
the
poetical
readings
during
the
that
will
be
a
most
excellent
plan
said
captain
quitman
variety
is
the
spice
of
life
you
yes
and
i
beg
to
remind
your
majesty
exclaimed
the
duke
that
the
opportunity
to
shake
the
fantastic
toe
must
be
provided
of
course
ejaculated
captain
quitman
that
is
a
consummation
devoutly
to
be
wished
we
can
find
plenty
of
time
for
that
dancing
hours
will
be
from
seven
till
nine
and
the
literary
exercises
will
commence
at
nine
and
continue
until
morpheus
takes
i
wonder
what
kind
of
a
story
the
barbarian
chief
is
going
to
dish
out
to
us
said
george
iii
will
it
treat
of
war
love
or
politics
will
it
tell
of
battles
and
blood
or
will
it
describe
sweet
birds
sweet
flowers
and
sweet
love
it
would
be
better
perhaps
to
tell
the
story
first
and
answer
your
questions
afterward
replied
ingomar
i
shall
tell
it
under
protest
the
materials
which
are
at
my
disposal
if
skillfully
handled
would
construct
an
interesting
novel
but
i
am
not
vain
enough
to
imagine
that
i
can
weave
them
into
anything
like
a
good
story
my
life
has
been
crowded
with
many
thrilling
incidents
i
have
tasted
the
bitterest
dregs
in
fortune
s
cup
and
i
have
sailed
on
the
smooth
ocean
of
pleasure
and
as
her
majesty
has
commanded
me
to
entertain
her
guests
with
a
story
i
shall
confine
myself
to
a
truthful
history
of
scenes
in
which
i
have
been
an
actor
in
order
to
save
time
i
shall
group
the
most
prominent
incidents
and
set
them
down
in
the
city
of
memphis
and
vicinity
taking
the
liberty
to
change
the
venue
of
an
important
criminal
case
from
new
york
to
the
bluff
city
if
you
should
ask
me
by
what
authority
i
venture
to
change
the
venue
from
one
state
to
another
i
would
answer
by
referring
you
to
the
numerous
instances
where
the
united
states
courts
have
exercised
the
arbitrary
power
to
do
such
things
shall
i
as
a
champion
story
teller
regularly
commissioned
by
a
mighty
and
beauteous
queen
be
denied
the
privileges
claimed
by
a
little
united
states
court
i
say
the
venue
is
changed
to
memphis
and
when
i
begin
to
describe
the
interesting
trial
i
trust
no
one
will
be
so
inquisitive
as
to
examine
the
records
with
a
view
to
contradicting
my
truthful
history
if
i
choose
to
introduce
my
under
de
i
hope
my
friends
will
raise
no
objections
because
while
i
claim
that
the
acts
of
public
men
constitute
public
property
i
am
afraid
to
take
too
much
liberty
in
that
respect
lest
i
should
endanger
my
valuable
we
command
you
to
cease
your
continuous
talk
about
preliminaries
observed
queen
mary
as
she
waved
her
hand
impatiently
toward
ingomar
no
one
shall
be
compelled
to
listen
to
the
tale
tell
the
story
and
let
us
judge
for
ourselves
as
to
its

obey
your
majesty
s
commands
replied
ingomar
perhaps
said
captain
quitman
as
a
quizzical
smile
played
on
his
handsome
countenance
our
friend
sancho
panza
would
contribute
something
of
an
intellectual
character
to
our
programme
maybe
he
will
do
us
the
honor
to
become
a
member
of
our
literary
club
said
scottie
as
she
courtesied
to
him
i
beg
to
assure
you
madame
that
you
honor
me
too
highly
but
at
the
same
time
permit
me
to
say
that
i
have
no
doubt
i
shall
be
able
to
render
some
assistance
if
as
i
understand
it
is
to
be
intellectual
amusement
you
seek
i
flatter
myself
with
the
opinion
that
my
contribution
will
be
what
shall
it
be
sancho
inquired
george
iii
i
will
repeat
the
multiplication
table
from
beginning
to
end
and
whistle
yankee
a
perfect
roar
of
laughter
was
produced
by
sancho
s
thrust
but
the
young
people
became
convinced
that
nothing
was
to
be
made
by
poking
wit
at
him
a
couple
of
politicians
who
occupied
seats
near
the
lower
end
of
the
table
were
engaged
in
an
animated
discussion
which
was
attracting
considerable
attention
for
my
part
said
general
camphollower
i
think
that
our
government
dealt
too
leniently
with
rebels
after
the
i
believe
replied
colonel
confed
that
the
views
you
express
were
those
held
by
men
who
never
smelled
burned
powder
or
heard
the
whistle
of
a
hostile
bullet
but
all
brave
soldiers
who
fought
in
the
union
army
from
general
grant
down
to
the
humblest
private
were
opposed
to
any
harsh
i
perceive
replied
general
camphollower
that
you
are
not
being
much
gentlemen
said
captain
quitman
pardon
me
for
interrupting
your
conversation
but
i
would
beg
to
suggest
the
propriety
of
eschewing
politics
while
on
this
excursion
let
the
past
bury
the
past
let
us
cultivate
a
feeling
of
friendship
between
the
north
and
south
both
parties
committed
errors
let
both
parties
get
back
to
the
right
track
let
us
try
to
profit
by
our
sad
experience
let
us
teach
forgiveness
and
patriotism
and
look
forward
to
the
time
when
the
cruel
war
shall
be
forgotten
we
have
a
great
and
glorious
nation
of
which
we
are
very
proud
and
we
will
make
it
greater
by
our
love
and
support
it
was
a
family
quarrel
and
the
family
has
settled
it
and
woe
be
to
the
outsider
who
shall
dare
to
interfere
hurrah
hurrah
for
uncle
sam
was
unanimously
shouted
by
all
the
passengers
uncle
sam
shall
live
forever
and
those
unpatriotic
politicians
who
have
crippled
him
shall
be
driven
into
obscurity
let
peace
and
good
will
brotherly
love
and
good
faith
exist
between
the
north
and
south
and
let
satan
take
those
who
wave
the
bloody
good
good
hear
hear
was
shouted
long
and
loud
by
all
the
guests
while
the
two
politicians
shook
hands
across
the
table
and
bumped
their
glasses
together
by
this
time
the
table
was
cleared
and
the
waiters
began
to
uncork
innumerable
bottles
of
champagne
ladies
and
gentlemen
said
captain
quitman
as
his
tall
handsome
form
rose
high
above
the
crowd
fill
your
glasses
and
hear
my
some
little
confusion
then
ensued
while
each
guest
was
having
his
glass
filled
and
then
the
captain
s
voice
rang
out
as
he
spoke
here
is
to
the
union
as
it
was
in
the
days
of
its
general
camphollower
responded
in
an
eloquent
speech
and
took
his
seat
amid
thundering
applause
then
reaching
his
hand
across
the
table
toward
colonel
confed
he
exclaimed
here
is
my
hand
colonel
let
us
shake
across
the
table
and
consider
it
the
bloody
george
iii
whispered
to
the
duke
do
you
know
that
lady
yonder
in
the
black
silk
domino
indeed
i
do
not
in
fact
i
had
not
noticed
there
is
a
mystery
about
that
woman
as
sure
as
we
stand
here
just
look
at
her
will
you
she
is
weeping
i
have
been
watching
her
for
the
last
half
hour
and
there
is
a
strangeness
in
all
her
movements
hard
to
understand
and
harder
still
to
come
come
my
lord
exclaimed
the
duke
as
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
shoulder
of
the
king
you
can
not
deceive
me
you
are
endeavoring
to
imitate
romeo
he
fell
in
love
with
juliet
at
a
upon
honor
i
have
not
said
a
word
to
that
lady
and
i
have
no
intention
or
desire
to
do
so
but
i
would
like
very
much
to
know
who
she
is
what
can
be
the
matter
with
the
poor
lady
i
wonder
don
t
you
see
how
she
is
weeping
i
dare
say
that
the
song
the
queen
sang
a
while
ago
has
called
up
unpleasant
reminiscences
she
may
have
sung
that
song
to
a
lover
who
was
afterward
killed
in
the
late
war
this
unfortunate
land
is
full
of
aching
hearts
and
crushed
hopes
thousands
of
mothers
sisters
and
sweethearts
are
weeping
and
wailing
for
dear
ones
who
silently
sleep
in
bloody
that
is
all
very
true
but
that
lady
is
distressed
about
something
that
has
happened
on
this
boat
because
she
was
weeping
before
the
queen
sang
the
sweet
song
she
did
not
go
to
the
table
at
lunch
and
she
has
been
continually
passing
among
all
the
passengers
and
apparently
searching
for
well
i
hope
she
will
succeed
in
finding
the
individual
she
is
looking
for
if
as
you
think
she
is
really
shadowing
some
my
lord
said
the
queen
as
she
approached
the
duke
if
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
collect
our
friends
on
the
hurricane
deck
we
will
order
the
barbarian
chief
to
commence
the
relation
of
his
little
the
duke
courtesied
to
the
queen
and
immediately
began
to
execute
her
commands
and
it
was
but
a
few
minutes
until
the
entire
party
were
seated
on
the
upper
deck
the
party
having
arranged
themselves
in
a
circle
in
the
center
of
which
sat
the
queen
in
a
large
mary
bowed
to
ingomar
and
requested
him
to
commence
his
story
ingomar
took
his
seat
facing
the
queen
in
a
comfortable
low
chair
which
had
been
provided
for
his
especial
use
and
began
to
relate
the
following
story
ingomar
s
story
i
was
born
in
nashville
tennessee
and
was
six
years
old
when
my
mother
died
i
was
her
only
child
and
as
a
matter
of
course
was
much
petted
and
greatly
beloved
by
her
the
memory
of
my
dear
mother
is
as
indelibly
fixed
on
my
mind
as
the
inscription
on
a
marble
monument
though
i
trust
that
my
poor
heart
does
not
in
any
manner
resemble
the
cold
unfeeling
marble
my
father
was
at
the
time
of
my
mother
s
death
a
prosperous
merchant
but
from
that
date
he
began
to
neglect
his
business
and
i
regret
to
say
commenced
to
spend
his
time
at
hotels
and
liquor
saloons
i
was
left
at
home
alone
with
the
and
another
servant
except
what
time
i
spent
at
school
i
was
too
young
to
understand
or
realize
how
rapidly
my
father
was
traveling
the
downward
road
but
i
soon
began
to
notice
that
he
was
unsteady
in
his
walk
and
that
he
was
becoming
cross
and
hard
to
please
i
did
not
know
then
that
he
was
growing
fond
of
brandy
nor
did
i
imagine
that
one
whom
i
loved
so
dearly
could
do
anything
wrong
but
alas
how
soon
was
this
blissful
ignorance
displaced
by
a
knowledge
of
the
awful
truth
my
father
had
been
born
and
bred
a
gentleman
and
when
not
under
the
influence
of
brandy
was
as
kind
and
tender
with
me
as
heart
could
wish
the
exact
amount
of
his
fortune
at
the
date
of
my
mother
s
death
i
never
knew
though
i
have
since
learned
that
it
was
no
insignificant
sum
but
as
a
natural
result
of
his
neglect
of
business
the
firm
became
involved
more
and
more
every
year
until
it
finally
collapsed
at
the
end
of
the
second
year
after
my
mother
s
death
when
i
was
eight
years
old
the
servants
began
to
talk
of
leaving
on
account
of
the
bad
treatment
which
my
father
gave
them
complaining
of
a
neglect
on
his
part
to
pay
them
their
wages
i
also
frequently
heard
them
hint
of
a
second
marriage
which
my
father
was
contemplating
which
as
may
be
imagined
gave
me
great
uneasiness
for
i
had
imbibed
the
usual
prejudice
felt
by
children
against
but
if
i
had
known
then
what
i
do
now
i
should
have
entertained
very
different
views
if
there
ever
was
an
angel
on
earth
my
was
one
i
shall
never
forget
my
feelings
when
the
informed
me
that
my
new
mother
would
be
brought
home
that
evening
my
heart
felt
as
if
it
would
break
and
my
eyes
were
filled
with
tears
as
i
let
my
young
mind
wander
back
to
the
happy
days
when
i
had
been
fondly
held
to
my
own
dear
mother
s
bosom
while
i
was
dreaming
of
the
happy
days
that
were
forever
gone
and
occasionally
shuddering
at
the
prospect
before
me
my
accompanied
by
her
two
children
entered
the
room
where
i
was
and
without
ceremony
caught
me
in
her
arms
and
kissed
me
i
have
never
ceased
to
love
her
from
that
moment
she
was
a
frail
delicate
darling
little
woman
with
dark
brown
hair
and
expressive
blue
eyes
and
a
voice
as
sweet
as
the
music
of
the
cooing
dove
and
her
two
children
were
very
much
like
her
as
to
beauty
and
gentleness
of
disposition
harry
wallingford
her
son
was
one
year
younger
than
i
and
his
sister
charlotte
was
one
year
younger
than
her
brother
she
was
the
very
image
of
her
mother
having
the
same
kind
of
deep
blue
eyes
only
somewhat
larger
and
her
hair
of
a
bright
golden
hue
floated
in
pretty
curls
about
her
neck
and
shoulders
her
skin
i
thought
was
too
white
as
it
had
rather
a
bloodless
appearance
amounting
to
transparency
the
were
long
the
brows
likewise
which
gave
to
the
countenance
something
of
a
dreamy
thoughtful
appearance
i
may
have
been
rather
extravagant
in
making
my
judgment
as
to
her
personal
appearance
but
i
thought
then
and
i
think
now
that
she
was
the
most
charming
little
creature
that
i
had
ever
beheld
harry
was
a
and
as
i
thought
rather
effeminate
boy
but
a
more
manly
fellow
than
he
proved
to
be
i
never
knew
he
and
i
became
bosom
friends
from
the
start
and
we
were
both
in
love
with
lottie
he
loved
her
as
a
brother
and
i
worshipped
her
because
i
could
not
help
it
and
to
be
candid
i
never
tried
to
help
it
how
was
it
possible
for
any
one
to
associate
daily
with
such
a
darling
child
and
not
love
her
with
all
his
heart
lottie
seemed
to
permit
me
to
love
her
as
if
such
devotion
was
no
more
than
her
just
dues
and
without
making
any
demonstrations
of
affection
for
me
i
am
at
a
loss
to
know
how
to
begin
to
describe
harry
wallingford
for
i
must
say
that
i
never
had
met
any
one
before
or
since
who
possessed
such
a
combination
of
peculiar
traits
of
character
as
he
did
sometimes
you
would
think
he
was
the
most
passionless
boy
that
ever
was
created
and
then
when
anything
happened
to
rouse
him
he
would
show
such
signs
of
passion
as
to
almost
frighten
me
or
when
any
cause
of
real
sorrow
would
come
upon
him
his
heart
would
begin
to
melt
at
once
and
he
would
weep
like
a
woman
there
was
no
such
feeling
as
jealousy
between
harry
and
me
on
account
of
my
love
for
his
sister
being
then
mere
children
and
all
intensely
in
love
with
each
other
we
were
all
sent
to
the
same
school
situated
about
a
mile
from
our
home
we
were
kept
at
the
same
school
for
four
years
and
oh
what
happy
years
were
they
to
me
not
a
ripple
of
sorrow
ever
crossed
the
smooth
surface
of
our
sea
of
pleasure
save
when
my
father
would
come
home
intoxicated
and
then
for
a
time
we
would
collect
in
the
garden
and
speak
in
whispers
lest
he
should
find
us
he
was
very
kind
to
us
when
sober
but
when
his
reason
was
clouded
with
brandy
he
seemed
to
be
jealous
of
the
love
which
our
mother
manifested
toward
us
and
often
gave
way
to
his
passion
and
abused
her
in
a
most
shocking
manner
poverty
began
at
length
to
make
its
unwelcome
presence
at
our
home
but
we
were
too
young
to
realize
or
feel
its
influences
as
our
poor
mother
did
the
servants
had
all
left
us
because
my
father
had
no
money
to
pay
their
wages
and
our
mother
was
compelled
to
do
her
own
work
but
lottie
was
as
industrious
as
a
honey
bee
and
assisted
her
mother
all
she
could
while
harry
and
i
did
all
we
could
to
make
her
work
light
we
cultivated
the
garden
made
the
fires
and
assisted
lottie
to
milk
the
cow
in
fact
we
made
ourselves
useful
in
every
way
we
could
and
in
spite
of
our
poverty
we
were
very
happy
i
don
t
think
my
would
have
married
my
father
if
she
had
known
of
his
bad
habits
but
after
the
fatal
step
had
been
taken
she
seemed
to
have
made
up
her
mind
to
make
the
best
of
her
bad
bargain
no
matter
how
thick
and
heavy
were
the
troubles
that
crowded
on
her
she
always
met
us
on
our
return
from
school
with
a
pleasant
smile
and
the
same
love
and
tenderness
which
she
bestowed
on
her
own
children
were
at
all
times
extended
to
me
when
our
wardrobe
began
to
grow
scant
and
our
garments
to
become
seedy
and
sometimes
full
of
rents
our
dear
mother
would
work
till
midnight
with
lottie
by
her
side
mending
them
i
would
often
drop
my
book
and
gaze
at
lottie
as
she
sat
by
the
dim
lamp
the
golden
curls
falling
about
her
shoulders
while
her
little
fingers
made
the
needle
bob
up
and
down
with
lightning
speed
as
she
mended
a
rent
in
my
old
coat
and
wonder
if
the
angels
in
heaven
were
like
her
my
father
spent
but
little
of
his
time
at
home
which
circumstance
enabled
us
to
snatch
happiness
from
the
very
bottom
pit
of
poverty
i
was
deeply
grieved
to
notice
that
my
mother
s
health
was
gradually
declining
but
i
did
not
know
then
that
it
was
the
result
of
overwork
and
scanty
food
coupled
with
the
cruel
treatment
from
my
father
neither
harry
nor
i
had
a
suspicion
of
the
true
state
of
affairs
else
we
would
have
quit
school
and
gone
to
work
in
order
to
help
support
the
family
when
our
little
basket
would
be
filled
with
provisions
every
morning
by
our
mother
before
we
started
for
school
we
did
not
know
that
she
was
left
frequently
to
work
hard
all
day
without
a
morsel
for
dinner
i
would
have
worked
night
and
day
as
a
slave
to
have
made
her
comfortable
and
so
would
harry
but
the
secret
of
her
real
condition
was
concealed
from
us
until
we
had
been
at
school
four
years
when
we
began
to
realize
the
situation
we
at
once
left
the
school
and
began
to
seek
employment
but
in
this
attempt
we
were
often
doomed
to
disappointment
because
we
were
too
young
to
expect
to
get
situations
as
clerks
and
not
strong
enough
to
do
much
at
manual
labor
harry
was
one
of
those
persevering
tenacious
kind
of
boys
that
never
abandon
anything
they
undertake
and
although
he
was
younger
than
i
he
was
the
leader
in
all
our
enterprises
he
was
energetic
and
hopeful
i
was
the
reverse
of
that
and
i
could
not
accomplish
anything
except
when
i
was
encouraged
and
led
by
him
i
therefore
submitted
to
his
leadership
and
followed
him
from
place
to
place
seeking
employment
sometimes
we
would
manage
to
secure
several
little
profitable
jobs
during
the
day
and
every
cent
we
got
was
handed
over
to
our
mother
then
some
days
we
would
traverse
the
streets
from
early
morning
until
night
without
finding
any
work
to
do
and
when
this
would
happen
our
scanty
supply
of
provisions
would
grow
more
scant
until
we
found
the
wolf
at
our
very
door
i
do
not
know
how
my
father
managed
to
obtain
his
meals
for
he
scarcely
ever
came
home
and
when
he
did
come
he
was
so
much
overcome
with
brandy
that
he
would
fall
down
on
a
bed
and
sleep
for
many
hours
then
rise
and
go
straight
to
the
nearest
whisky
shop
it
was
about
six
months
after
we
were
compelled
to
quit
school
that
a
man
with
red
nose
and
bloated
face
and
very
shabbily
dressed
staggered
into
our
house
and
informed
my
mother
that
her
husband
had
fallen
from
a
window
and
broken
his
neck
i
learned
that
my
father
had
been
carousing
with
a
gang
of
disreputable
men
in
the
second
story
of
a
drinking
and
gambling
house
and
had
staggered
through
the
window
falling
on
the
stone
pavement
below
his
neck
was
dislocated
his
head
and
face
mangled
and
he
was
quite
dead
when
his
drunken
companions
went
to
him
this
dreadful
ending
of
my
poor
father
s
life
gave
my
mother
such
a
shock
that
she
was
compelled
to
take
to
her
bed
from
which
she
never
rose
again
it
was
not
quite
a
month
after
my
father
s
remains
were
deposited
in
the
grave
when
my
darling
s
gentle
spirit
went
to
its
eternal
home
the
last
days
of
her
life
were
not
days
of
suffering
as
is
usual
in
such
cases
for
she
informed
her
weeping
children
that
she
was
perfectly
free
from
pain
come
here
my
son
and
sit
near
me
she
said
to
harry
one
day
a
short
time
before
her
death
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
about
what
you
shall
do
when
i
am
poor
boy
he
was
weeping
as
if
his
heart
would
break
no
one
ever
loved
a
darling
mother
more
than
harry
loved
his
and
no
mother
ever
had
a
more
noble
dutiful
son
than
harry
you
must
not
grieve
about
me
after
i
am
taken
from
you
my
darling
boy
but
you
will
live
such
a
life
as
will
enable
you
to
come
to
meet
me
when
it
is
ended
i
need
not
advise
you
to
be
good
noble
honorable
all
through
life
because
i
feel
assured
that
you
will
be
all
that
but
few
mothers
have
been
blessed
with
such
children
as
i
have
and
therefore
i
can
depart
from
them
with
a
loving
faith
and
hope
of
meeting
them
again
one
promise
i
shall
ask
you
to
make
though
and
that
is
that
you
will
devote
your
life
to
the
protection
of
your
sister
lottie
the
pitfalls
and
dangers
which
lie
in
the
path
of
human
life
are
much
more
numerous
and
much
greater
in
the
road
of
a
young
girl
than
are
to
be
found
in
the
one
of
a
young
dear
mother
said
i
as
i
knelt
by
the
bedside
and
seized
her
little
pale
hand
i
now
solemnly
promise
to
join
harry
in
this
sacred
duty
i
will
follow
him
through
life
to
aid
in
protecting
my
darling
sister
for
i
love
her
with
all
my
heart
and
do
here
now
swear
to
devote
my
life
to
her
service
god
bless
you
edward
she
said
as
she
placed
her
hand
on
my
head
this
is
very
good
in
you
and
will
be
remembered
to
your
credit
where
good
and
bad
deeds
are
harry
was
unable
to
make
a
promise
of
any
kind
being
so
overcome
with
grief
that
he
could
not
utter
a
word
but
had
fallen
on
the
bed
by
his
mother
s
side
clinging
to
her
neck
and
pressing
his
lips
to
her
pale
brow
he
appeared
to
lose
control
of
his
feelings
an
unusual
thing
for
him
to
do
for
he
was
generally
more
than
other
boys
his
mother
whispered
to
me
directing
me
to
take
him
away
i
lifted
him
in
my
arms
and
carried
him
to
another
room
and
laid
him
on
the
bed
and
remained
with
him
until
he
became
somewhat
calm
oh
edward
said
he
while
his
eyes
were
full
of
tears
how
can
we
live
without
her
shall
that
darling
sweet
face
be
forever
hidden
from
us
what
will
become
of
poor
lottie
when
our
mother
is
gone
can
we
not
work
for
her
can
we
not
take
care
of
her
i
will
help
you
harry
i
will
never
forsake
you
and
lottie
i
will
go
with
you
to
the
end
of
the
world
to
help
work
for
lottie
you
are
my
brother
she
is
my
sister
and
nothing
shall
ever
part
us
but
thank
you
eddie
you
are
very
good
and
we
shall
stay
lottie
was
soundly
sleeping
unconscious
of
the
fact
that
she
was
soon
to
be
motherless
we
had
so
far
kept
her
in
ignorance
of
the
situation
but
i
afterward
was
convinced
of
the
great
error
we
committed
in
doing
so
for
when
the
time
came
in
which
concealment
was
no
longer
possible
she
was
wholly
unprepared
for
the
blow
she
had
not
suspected
that
her
mother
was
on
her
but
had
been
continually
chatting
cheerfully
about
the
new
blooming
flowers
telling
her
mother
how
pretty
they
would
be
by
the
time
she
should
be
able
to
walk
in
the
garden
every
morning
she
placed
a
fresh
bouquet
of
fragrant
flowers
on
a
little
table
by
her
mother
s
bedside
and
would
sit
for
hours
talking
to
her
while
she
was
busy
mending
garments
for
harry
and
me
it
was
a
beautiful
day
in
early
spring
when
the
gentle
spirit
of
our
darling
mother
took
its
leave
of
this
world
the
sweet
songs
of
many
little
birds
loaded
the
air
with
their
delightful
music
the
fresh
cool
breeze
came
stealing
through
the
open
windows
sweetened
with
the
fragrance
of
spring
flowers
and
all
nature
seemed
to
exert
her
energies
to
make
our
mother
s
last
moments
happy
when
i
am
gone
she
said
to
harry
you
will
take
lottie
to
my
brother
who
resides
in
memphis
he
will
give
her
a
home
and
you
and
edward
can
find
employment
there
i
leave
you
in
the
hands
of
him
who
promised
to
be
a
father
to
the
orphan
blessed
are
they
that
mourn
for
they
shall
be
blessed
are
the
pure
in
heart
for
they
shall
see
these
were
her
last
words
and
without
a
struggle
or
symptom
of
suffering
she
fell
asleep
in
the
arms
of
death
like
one
dropping
off
in
usual
slumber
her
arms
which
had
been
twined
about
harry
s
neck
were
gently
removed
and
he
was
carried
away
in
a
swoon
while
poor
lottie
sank
down
on
the
lifeless
body
totally
prostrated
with
her
great
chapter
iv
the
description
of
the
scene
was
given
by
ingomar
in
a
low
tremulous
voice
which
showed
that
he
was
struggling
hard
to
smother
his
grief
while
queen
mary
was
seen
to
brush
a
tear
from
her
cheek
quickly
as
if
she
were
trying
to
appear
unmoved
a
long
silence
ensued
and
the
maskers
sat
motionless
and
anxious
to
hear
more
of
the
story
why
the
queen
should
be
so
deeply
moved
by
the
story
was
a
mystery
to
many
of
the
listeners
who
is
she
anyway
was
the
question
that
many
of
the
maskers
mentally
asked
themselves
please
to
proceed
with
your
story
said
the
queen
bowing
to
ingomar
bending
low
in
acknowledgment
of
her
courtesy
ingomar
proceeded
as
follows
the
county
undertaker
was
sent
for
by
some
of
our
neighbors
and
was
about
to
take
charge
of
our
dead
mother
s
remains
in
order
to
give
it
a
pauper
s
interment
and
we
never
perhaps
would
have
understood
the
deep
degradation
but
when
the
plain
coffin
was
brought
to
the
house
i
saw
harry
gaze
at
it
for
a
moment
and
such
a
strange
look
too
it
was
a
deathly
paleness
overspread
his
face
as
he
directed
the
man
to
carry
the
rough
box
away
and
although
he
spoke
low
and
gently
there
was
a
firmness
in
his
tone
that
convinced
the
man
that
he
had
better
obey
come
with
me
eddie
he
said
as
he
gently
plucked
at
my
sleeve
she
sha
n
t
be
buried
in
such
a
box
as
i
of
course
followed
him
to
the
nearest
undertaker
s
shop
no
words
passed
between
us
as
we
walked
side
by
side
but
i
noticed
that
he
had
ceased
to
weep
and
that
there
was
an
expression
on
his
features
evincing
indescribable
suffering
his
face
still
retained
its
extreme
paleness
while
his
thin
lips
were
firmly
compressed
my
mother
is
dead
sir
said
he
to
a
gentleman
of
benevolent
appearance
who
met
us
at
the
door
of
the
shop
i
want
her
remains
put
away
in
a
nice
rosewood
case
i
want
her
buried
in
a
nice
grassy
lot
in
the
corner
of
the
cemetery
i
have
no
money
to
give
you
sir
but
we
have
some
household
furniture
some
of
which
is
very
valuable
there
are
some
beds
and
bedclothing
a
cow
and
calf
give
my
dear
mother
s
remains
a
decent
burial
take
all
we
have
and
let
me
know
what
is
lacking
to
compensate
you
and
i
give
you
my
word
of
honor
that
you
shall
never
be
the
loser
the
gentleman
fixed
his
gaze
on
harry
s
pale
face
and
continued
to
stare
at
him
for
several
seconds
as
if
he
were
trying
to
pierce
him
through
with
the
fierceness
of
the
look
then
abruptly
turning
on
his
heel
he
went
behind
the
counter
placed
both
elbows
on
it
resting
his
cheeks
on
his
hands
then
commenced
a
renewal
of
the
strange
gaze
harry
never
for
a
moment
turned
his
eyes
from
the
man
s
face
at
last
the
man
rose
up
and
struck
the
counter
a
heavy
blow
with
his
fist
as
if
he
were
endeavoring
to
murder
some
enemy
you
ll
do
i
ll
take
your
word
of
honor
there
s
no
falsehood
hidden
behind
that
face
your
mother
shall
have
the
most
cozy
spot
in
the
cemetery
and
the
finest
rosewood
coffin
in
the
house
there
now
go
home
and
i
ll
attend
to
right
well
indeed
did
the
generous
man
keep
his
word
for
i
don
t
think
i
ever
saw
a
prettier
burial
case
and
the
grave
was
dug
in
a
green
shady
spot
where
the
turf
was
very
thick
and
fresh
what
shall
we
do
now
harry
said
i
do
as
we
promised
our
dying
mother
of
course
you
know
she
made
us
promise
to
take
lottie
to
our
uncle
at
memphis
we
must
prepare
to
go
at
once
you
stay
here
with
lottie
while
i
go
to
see
fogg
the
undertaker
and
arrange
with
him
about
the
he
soon
returned
and
informed
me
that
the
business
had
been
settled
and
that
fogg
would
take
possession
of
the
effects
on
the
next
day
we
at
once
began
to
make
arrangements
for
commencing
our
journey
to
memphis
as
soon
as
fogg
should
take
possession
of
the
furniture
that
gentleman
kindly
offered
to
let
us
keep
the
furniture
and
allow
us
to
pay
him
the
funeral
expenses
when
fortune
should
be
disposed
to
deal
more
kindly
with
us
but
when
harry
informed
him
that
in
pursuance
of
his
mother
s
wishes
we
were
going
to
memphis
he
agreed
to
take
the
furniture
saying
that
it
would
amply
suffice
to
pay
the
debt
which
we
owed
him
accordingly
early
the
next
morning
the
keys
were
delivered
to
fogg
and
we
set
out
on
the
road
toward
memphis
we
had
not
the
most
remote
idea
as
to
the
nature
of
the
journey
that
lay
before
us
we
were
as
ignorant
regarding
the
distance
as
we
were
about
the
means
necessary
to
take
us
there
we
had
often
heard
and
read
about
memphis
as
a
young
and
thriving
city
on
the
banks
of
the
great
river
and
when
i
now
look
back
to
that
time
i
can
scarcely
realize
the
extreme
simplicity
of
our
minds
and
the
extravagant
ideas
we
had
as
to
our
ability
to
accomplish
the
journey
we
were
too
deeply
plunged
in
sorrow
to
ever
think
of
making
inquiries
as
to
the
distance
or
the
best
route
to
travel
we
might
have
saved
money
enough
by
the
sale
of
our
effects
to
pay
the
funeral
expenses
and
then
had
enough
left
to
pay
our
fare
on
a
boat
to
memphis
but
we
considered
nothing
thought
of
nothing
but
misery
kind
people
there
were
plenty
who
would
have
gladly
aided
or
advised
us
but
we
sought
no
aid
nor
did
we
speak
of
our
intentions
to
any
one
the
greatest
trouble
that
presented
itself
to
our
young
and
thoughtless
minds
was
the
sad
of
the
poor
but
dear
home
where
so
many
happy
days
had
been
spent
there
was
the
little
garden
with
its
neat
beds
of
new
flowers
that
had
flourished
under
the
constant
care
bestowed
on
them
by
lottie
there
were
the
jolly
little
birds
singing
so
sweetly
in
the
blooming
near
the
window
a
thousand
things
of
a
trifling
sort
but
dear
to
the
memory
were
now
to
be
looked
at
for
the
last
time
how
could
it
be
expected
that
under
the
circumstances
we
should
make
the
necessary
preparations
for
such
a
journey
how
could
we
think
of
bread
and
meat
clothes
or
cash
when
our
poor
hearts
were
melting
with
the
very
bitterness
of
sorrow
the
wonder
is
that
we
should
have
started
with
anything
at
all
we
hastily
packed
a
few
extra
garments
into
a
couple
of
sacks
snatched
up
a
few
articles
of
food
and
with
eyes
swimming
in
tears
bade
adieu
to
our
home
forever
harry
moved
on
in
front
lottie
and
i
following
not
a
word
was
spoken
no
one
bade
us
no
one
consoled
us
in
our
desolation
and
we
neither
asked
nor
sought
it
as
we
passed
through
the
streets
a
strange
look
would
occasionally
be
cast
on
us
by
the
pedestrians
as
we
passed
them
we
saw
but
little
and
were
moving
on
in
silence
when
i
perceived
that
harry
had
turned
his
course
and
was
going
toward
the
cemetery
i
knew
his
object
and
was
pleased
to
know
that
we
should
once
more
be
near
our
dear
mother
we
entered
the
city
of
the
dead
approached
the
sacred
spot
in
silence
and
fell
upon
the
little
mound
of
fresh
earth
that
rose
above
our
mother
and
moistened
it
with
our
tears
harry
had
brought
a
little
basket
of
fresh
flowers
which
i
had
not
noticed
until
i
saw
him
placing
it
on
the
grave
fogg
had
promised
to
have
a
plain
marble
slab
erected
with
the
proper
inscription
to
mark
the
spot
where
our
mother
rested
he
complied
with
his
promise
but
a
beautiful
monument
now
rises
high
over
the
grave
which
we
afterward
had
erected
we
remained
nearly
an
hour
bathing
the
cold
earth
with
our
tears
no
words
were
spoken
no
passionate
outbursts
of
grief
were
heard
but
in
solemn
silence
we
knelt
side
by
side
and
paid
the
last
tribute
of
love
to
the
memory
of
the
dead
one
who
slept
below
at
length
harry
turned
away
i
took
lottie
by
the
hand
and
followed
him
and
soon
we
were
moving
along
the
road
outside
of
the
city
limits
we
traveled
about
ten
miles
the
first
day
and
i
was
surprised
to
see
that
lottie
had
not
appeared
to
be
fatigued
at
all
she
had
walked
by
my
side
all
the
time
her
beautiful
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
and
i
noticed
ever
and
anon
a
fresh
shower
of
tears
would
fall
from
her
eyes
she
was
a
heroine
in
the
strongest
sense
of
the
term
never
complaining
unselfish
confiding
hopeful
and
when
not
thinking
of
her
great
loss
she
always
smiled
sweetly
when
speaking
to
harry
and
me
are
you
tired
lottie
inquired
harry
after
we
had
marched
about
five
miles
from
the
city
if
you
are
we
will
stop
and
rest
with
her
usual
smile
lighting
up
her
sweet
face
she
answered
in
the
negative
shaking
her
head
till
the
golden
curls
danced
about
her
shoulders
go
on
brother
pray
don
t
mind
me
i
am
not
the
least
as
the
sun
began
to
disappear
behind
the
steep
hill
that
rose
on
the
west
side
of
the
road
and
the
shadows
of
the
tall
trees
on
the
were
growing
very
long
we
began
to
think
of
the
manner
in
which
we
should
pass
the
night
shall
we
stop
at
a
inn
said
harry
or
shall
we
camp
in
the
woods
we
had
better
camp
out
i
replied
because
we
will
soon
be
out
of
money
if
we
undertake
to
secure
lodging
at
a
this
was
the
first
time
that
the
money
question
had
been
mentioned
or
thought
of
by
either
of
us
harry
and
i
both
instinctively
commenced
to
examine
our
pockets
to
see
how
much
money
we
could
command
and
found
that
the
sum
total
when
put
together
amounted
to
two
dollars
and
cents
i
have
got
cents
exclaimed
lottie
as
she
produced
the
shining
coin
from
her
pocket
and
handed
it
to
harry
looking
as
if
she
thought
it
sufficient
for
all
expenses
harry
was
unanimously
chosen
cashier
and
the
funds
all
handed
over
to
him
the
grand
total
amounting
to
three
dollars
and
this
little
sum
was
all
we
had
to
depend
on
for
our
subsistence
harry
sighed
as
he
held
the
money
in
his
hand
evidently
beginning
to
reflect
seriously
now
when
it
was
too
late
as
to
the
folly
of
undertaking
such
a
journey
with
so
small
a
sum
of
money
this
was
perhaps
the
first
time
that
either
of
us
had
given
a
thought
to
the
question
of
finance
and
those
who
are
inclined
to
sneer
at
our
ignorance
must
not
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
we
had
a
double
excuse
for
it
in
the
first
place
we
were
mere
children
i
being
then
in
my
thirteenth
year
harry
in
his
twelfth
and
lottie
not
quite
eleven
besides
this
we
had
been
so
suddenly
deprived
of
both
our
parents
that
our
great
sorrow
absorbed
all
our
thoughts
but
now
when
the
situation
began
to
be
disclosed
it
was
too
late
to
mend
the
matter
we
will
not
stop
in
a
house
observed
harry
sadly
we
can
t
afford
to
incur
the
expense
we
must
economize
in
every
way
we
so
it
was
agreed
that
we
would
depend
on
grass
and
leaves
for
a
bed
and
the
blue
sky
for
our
shelter
as
the
sun
finally
disappeared
we
came
to
a
halt
near
a
bubbling
spring
that
gushed
from
a
little
bluff
near
the
edge
of
a
thick
patch
of
timber
depositing
our
little
effects
at
the
root
of
a
beech
tree
whose
branches
were
thickly
covered
with
leaves
which
would
protect
us
from
the
falling
dew
and
soon
a
blazing
fire
shot
its
cheerful
flames
forth
as
the
blue
smoke
curled
gracefully
up
among
the
branches
of
the
tree
our
household
and
kitchen
furniture
if
i
may
be
permitted
to
use
a
facetious
remark
including
and
all
consisted
of
three
little
tin
cups
three
pure
silver
and
one
little
tin
while
our
stock
of
provisions
consisted
of
one
pound
of
pulverized
coffee
four
pounds
of
salt
pork
three
pounds
of
raw
ham
and
six
pounds
of
baker
s
bread
one
box
of
matches
and
one
pound
of
brown
sugar
with
her
sleeves
rolled
up
above
her
elbows
her
round
white
arms
looking
very
pretty
a
clean
white
apron
tied
with
a
pink
ribbon
about
her
waist
lottie
was
busy
broiling
some
slices
of
ham
on
the
coals
while
harry
was
trying
to
make
the
water
in
the
boil
as
i
sat
on
the
turf
leaning
against
the
tree
watching
the
operation
with
intense
interest
my
eyes
followed
lottie
in
all
her
movements
and
i
am
not
now
ashamed
to
confess
it
i
mentally
asked
myself
whose
wife
will
she
be
when
she
becomes
a
grown
lady
mine
mine
the
last
words
seemed
to
force
themselves
from
my
lips
in
much
louder
tones
than
was
intended
for
harry
asked
me
whom
i
was
speaking
to
is
the
water
boiling
yet
i
asked
by
way
of
hiding
my
confusion
i
think
it
is
was
the
reply
it
is
a
true
maxim
that
necessity
is
the
mother
of
invention
which
was
practically
demonstrated
on
that
occasion
by
lottie
s
ingenuity
in
arranging
our
supper
table
she
went
to
the
edge
of
a
little
brook
near
by
selected
a
smooth
flat
rock
some
fifteen
inches
square
washed
it
very
clean
and
placed
it
on
the
turf
then
she
went
back
selected
three
other
rocks
of
the
same
kind
only
not
so
large
and
after
she
had
scrubbed
them
till
they
were
very
clean
she
placed
them
on
the
ground
near
the
large
rock
then
with
a
little
forked
stick
she
lifted
the
slices
of
ham
and
placed
them
on
what
she
was
pleased
to
call
a
table
when
the
broiled
ham
had
been
placed
on
the
table
she
sliced
the
bread
and
placed
it
by
the
ham
then
arranging
the
three
little
tin
cups
in
a
row
on
the
table
she
poured
out
the
strong
black
coffee
supper
is
ready
now
she
said
with
as
much
dignity
as
if
she
had
been
inviting
us
to
a
costly
banquet
we
accordingly
gathered
round
the
table
seating
ourselves
on
the
grass
and
lottie
held
a
spoonful
of
sugar
toward
me
have
sugar
in
your
coffee
eddie
she
said
softly
as
i
held
my
cup
toward
her
to
receive
it
you
are
a
capital
cook
lottie
and
a
real
genius
in
the
way
of
inventive
faculties
said
i
i
am
truly
glad
you
are
pleased
with
my
cooking
but
you
know
i
have
had
but
little
chance
to
show
you
what
i
can
do
i
shall
improve
very
much
too
when
i
have
a
i
dare
say
you
will
and
i
mean
to
see
that
you
shall
have
a
fair
chance
one
of
these
i
can
truly
say
that
i
enjoyed
that
meal
as
much
as
any
one
i
ever
ate
notwithstanding
its
lack
of
variety
it
was
enough
for
me
to
know
that
it
was
prepared
by
the
one
i
loved
so
dearly
supper
being
over
i
began
to
erect
an
edifice
to
be
used
as
a
sleeping
apartment
by
lottie
and
having
watched
the
display
of
inventive
genius
which
she
had
exhibited
in
procuring
table
furniture
i
felt
it
to
be
my
duty
to
exert
all
my
mechanical
skill
in
the
erection
of
a
sleeping
chamber
for
her
i
stuck
four
little
forked
sticks
in
the
ground
then
laid
several
small
straight
sticks
across
the
top
and
covered
the
building
with
branches
cut
from
the
green
trees
i
put
them
on
so
thick
that
it
would
have
kept
out
the
rain
then
i
took
a
great
number
of
the
same
kind
of
branches
and
set
them
round
the
sides
leaving
a
little
opening
at
the
end
next
to
the
fire
then
i
gathered
up
a
large
quantity
of
dry
leaves
and
spread
them
on
the
turf
in
this
quaint
little
house
took
my
coat
spread
it
on
the
leaves
placed
my
little
sack
of
clothes
at
the
back
end
for
her
pillow
and
crossing
my
hands
behind
my
back
inspected
the
entire
building
and
was
satisfied
there
it
is
lottie
said
i
when
you
wish
to
retire
your
is
you
are
very
kind
eddie
and
i
thank
you
very
much
but
where
will
you
and
harry
sleep
o
never
mind
about
that
we
ll
make
us
a
nice
bed
of
leaves
on
the
other
side
of
the
you
had
better
lie
down
lottie
said
harry
i
dare
say
you
are
very
tired
and
then
you
know
we
must
go
a
long
way
lottie
took
a
little
testament
from
her
satchel
and
read
a
chapter
as
she
stooped
near
the
fire
so
as
to
get
the
benefit
of
the
light
replaced
the
book
in
the
satchel
then
went
into
her
cozy
little
bedroom
harry
and
i
sat
gazing
silently
at
the
fire
watching
the
columns
of
smoke
as
they
went
winding
up
through
the
green
leaves
above
our
heads
a
every
now
and
then
would
make
the
night
air
ring
with
a
song
as
he
sat
on
the
top
of
the
tree
the
gentle
murmur
of
the
little
brook
as
its
sparkling
waters
went
dancing
among
the
rocks
had
a
soothing
effect
on
my
mind
no
words
were
spoken
by
either
of
us
we
were
not
asleep
but
both
were
dreaming
my
body
was
still
but
my
mind
was
at
work
the
architectural
skill
of
my
mind
was
being
taxed
to
its
utmost
capacity
the
castle
which
i
was
preparing
to
build
was
one
of
indescribable
beauty
and
symmetry
the
foundation
had
been
laid
materials
for
the
edifice
collected
and
the
magnificent
structure
began
to
assume
a
finished
appearance
but
alas
just
as
i
was
rounding
off
the
beautiful
dome
and
giving
it
a
finishing
touch
the
whole
building
came
tumbling
down
i
ll
die
first
those
words
came
gushing
forth
and
i
was
as
much
startled
by
them
as
harry
was
what
are
you
talking
about
said
he
nothing
was
the
reply
for
i
was
ashamed
to
have
been
caught
muttering
to
myself
i
had
fallen
into
a
habit
of
muttering
to
myself
especially
when
my
mind
was
very
busy
with
some
sort
of
castle
building
which
was
by
no
means
seldom
the
materials
out
of
which
my
castle
had
been
built
were
very
good
and
the
workmanship
not
at
all
inferior
but
the
main
part
of
the
foundation
had
been
laid
on
sand
which
proved
to
be
too
weak
or
soft
to
support
such
a
weight
hence
the
destruction
of
one
of
the
most
beautiful
castles
ever
built
the
materials
used
in
the
building
were
composed
of
pure
love
the
dome
was
made
of
sweet
prospects
of
a
cottage
in
a
shady
grove
near
memphis
with
lottie
as
my
wife
the
magnificent
fluted
columns
that
were
to
adorn
the
portico
of
my
castle
were
made
of
long
years
of
true
service
which
i
had
vowed
to
devote
to
lottie
s
happiness
the
polished
cornice
that
was
to
make
such
a
charming
finish
to
the
four
fronts
was
made
of
an
imagination
or
golden
dreams
of
a
long
and
happy
life
to
be
spent
with
dear
lottie
as
my
wife
but
suppose
she
should
fall
in
love
with
and
marry
some
other
fellow
this
supposition
was
the
sand
that
brought
my
castle
down
as
the
castle
came
crumbling
down
it
was
the
fall
that
startled
me
and
i
exclaimed
in
my
bitter
anguish
i
ll
die
if
i
had
uttered
the
entire
sentence
aloud
it
would
have
read
thus
no
other
man
shall
ever
be
lottie
s
husband
no
never
i
ll
die
first
let
it
not
be
inferred
that
i
was
at
all
disposed
to
abandon
my
occupation
of
castle
building
for
i
set
about
the
work
again
with
a
more
determined
resolution
to
finish
the
grand
enterprise
but
before
i
got
it
finished
my
eyelids
began
to
feel
very
heavy
and
i
soon
was
compelled
to
lay
aside
my
tools
for
that
time
and
was
directly
sleeping
soundly
on
my
bed
of
leaves
by
the
side
of
my
dear
brother
i
imagine
that
i
must
have
slept
very
soundly
during
the
night
for
if
i
was
at
all
disturbed
by
dreams
they
could
not
have
been
of
an
unpleasant
kind
else
i
should
have
remembered
them
when
i
awoke
only
one
dream
came
to
interfere
with
my
repose
and
that
occurred
after
sunrise
next
morning
i
dreamed
that
lottie
and
i
were
on
the
banks
of
a
beautiful
little
river
whose
deep
blue
water
glided
smoothly
along
filled
with
innumerable
tiny
fishes
and
that
i
was
holding
my
hook
in
the
water
to
catch
them
just
as
a
beautiful
little
trout
began
to
nibble
at
my
hook
and
when
i
was
expecting
to
fasten
him
a
huge
mosquito
with
long
sharp
bill
alighted
on
my
nose
and
began
to
partake
of
his
breakfast
i
struck
at
the
impudent
intruder
and
hit
lottie
s
hand
who
was
tickling
my
nose
with
a
blade
of
grass
get
up
brother
sluggard
breakfast
is
ready
said
she
as
she
pointed
toward
the
smoking
ham
which
she
proceeded
to
place
on
the
table
how
did
you
rest
last
night
lottie
o
very
well
indeed
thanks
for
the
nice
comfortable
bed
you
made
for
did
you
not
get
cold
during
the
night
no
i
don
t
think
i
did
for
i
slept
very
soundly
and
probably
should
have
been
sleeping
yet
but
brother
harry
called
me
at
daylight
to
help
him
get
breakfast
i
feel
so
much
refreshed
that
i
shall
be
able
to
walk
a
long
way
we
arranged
ourselves
round
the
table
and
soon
dispatched
our
breakfast
and
began
to
prepare
for
a
renewal
of
our
journey
harry
and
i
carried
all
the
household
and
kitchen
furniture
in
the
two
little
sacks
which
swung
on
our
shoulders
while
lottie
was
not
permitted
to
carry
anything
but
her
little
satchel
the
road
we
traveled
on
the
second
day
of
our
journey
traversed
a
part
of
the
country
that
was
thickly
inhabited
by
thrifty
farmers
rich
green
clover
fields
spread
out
on
our
left
while
large
numbers
of
fat
cattle
were
grazing
on
the
rich
pasturage
many
beautiful
residences
with
gardens
in
front
of
them
appeared
on
each
side
of
the
road
happy
children
frolicked
on
the
green
turf
honey
bees
sucked
the
sweet
clover
blossoms
busily
collecting
their
winter
store
of
food
hundreds
of
little
birds
made
charming
music
among
the
green
trees
that
lined
the
roadside
the
scenery
was
altogether
delightful
but
we
stopped
not
to
enjoy
it
but
moved
steadily
on
with
minds
bent
on
the
accomplishment
of
the
task
before
us
i
marched
as
usual
by
lottie
harry
moving
steadily
in
the
lead
i
would
occasionally
drop
behind
for
no
other
purpose
than
to
watch
lottie
s
pretty
little
feet
as
they
rose
and
fell
with
tread
making
such
nice
little
tracks
in
the
dust
notwithstanding
the
many
eventful
years
that
have
passed
since
then
i
remember
well
how
i
almost
worshipped
the
dust
that
kissed
her
feet
toward
noon
i
noticed
from
her
movements
that
she
was
becoming
very
tired
but
in
answer
to
my
questions
on
that
subject
she
tried
to
make
me
believe
differently
i
whispered
to
harry
calling
his
attention
to
the
fact
and
suggested
that
we
had
better
stop
to
let
her
rest
we
halted
near
a
running
stream
and
selecting
a
cool
shady
spot
we
threw
ourselves
on
the
grass
we
had
traveled
about
eight
miles
and
i
began
to
feel
somewhat
fatigued
myself
and
when
i
was
comfortably
stretched
on
the
ground
i
soon
fell
asleep
we
rested
about
three
hours
eating
a
cold
snack
of
bread
and
ham
and
then
resumed
our
journey
moving
steadily
on
until
the
sun
went
down
when
we
halted
having
marched
about
fifteen
miles
in
all
that
day
and
i
was
deeply
pained
to
see
that
lottie
began
to
limp
with
her
left
foot
which
i
learned
was
caused
by
a
painful
blister
which
appeared
on
her
instep
i
took
my
knife
and
cut
a
little
hole
in
the
shoe
so
that
the
blister
would
not
be
rubbed
by
the
leather
and
the
grateful
look
that
she
cast
on
me
would
have
been
compensation
for
any
amount
of
trouble
a
description
of
our
second
encampment
is
unnecessary
as
it
was
nearly
similar
to
the
first
the
only
difference
being
the
lack
of
cold
spring
water
which
we
of
course
regretted
but
we
managed
to
make
out
with
the
water
from
a
clear
running
brook
near
by
having
finished
our
frugal
repast
i
set
about
preparing
lottie
s
sleeping
apartment
which
i
soon
completed
pretty
much
on
the
same
plan
as
the
one
i
had
made
for
her
the
night
before
though
i
think
i
made
a
much
better
job
of
it
this
time
we
had
finished
our
preparations
for
the
night
and
were
seated
near
the
fire
when
a
strange
dog
came
up
deliberately
seating
himself
by
lottie
and
began
to
whine
and
lick
her
hand
he
would
in
all
probability
have
wagged
his
tail
but
he
had
none
and
it
seemed
that
his
misfortunes
had
not
stopped
with
the
loss
of
his
tail
for
he
had
only
one
eye
and
one
and
a
half
ears
the
half
of
his
left
ear
being
painfully
missing
lottie
was
a
little
startled
and
perhaps
frightened
at
first
but
when
she
saw
how
anxious
the
poor
dog
was
to
make
friends
with
her
she
held
out
her
hand
and
patted
his
back
the
mournful
expression
of
his
countenance
and
the
dilapidated
condition
of
his
body
at
once
enlisted
her
sympathies
and
she
gathered
up
all
the
scraps
of
bread
and
meat
and
gave
them
to
him
which
he
devoured
quickly
and
like
oliver
twist
wanted
when
lottie
went
to
bed
the
poor
tailless
old
dog
laid
himself
down
at
her
feet
with
dignity
and
composure
doubtless
thinking
that
he
had
found
a
friend
at
last
i
watched
the
dignified
movements
of
the
strange
animal
with
some
degree
of
interest
he
paid
no
attention
to
harry
and
me
but
appeared
to
consider
it
his
duty
to
guard
lottie
it
was
a
clear
case
to
my
mind
of
love
at
first
sight
how
could
the
poor
dog
help
loving
her
birds
dogs
and
men
all
loved
her
the
fact
is
it
seemed
that
she
was
made
to
be
worshipped
by
men
animals
and
birds
i
suppose
that
with
his
one
eye
the
old
dog
could
see
her
kind
beautiful
face
and
that
he
knew
she
was
good
judging
from
appearances
one
might
safely
conclude
that
the
dog
had
been
an
inhabitant
of
the
earth
for
a
great
number
of
years
and
that
he
could
form
a
correct
opinion
as
to
the
character
of
those
whom
he
chose
to
serve
when
we
started
on
our
journey
next
morning
old
bob
as
we
had
named
the
dog
the
name
being
suggested
to
our
minds
by
his
lack
of
a
tail
began
to
walk
with
strange
dignity
by
the
side
of
lottie
he
was
the
first
dog
i
ever
saw
that
couldn
t
trot
but
his
principal
gait
was
a
walk
though
he
could
strike
a
gallop
when
occasion
required
and
was
often
seen
pacing
trouble
began
to
crowd
on
us
the
third
day
of
our
journey
our
little
stock
of
provisions
was
exhausted
lottie
though
she
would
not
complain
was
beginning
to
fail
her
feet
were
covered
with
blisters
and
it
was
distressing
to
see
her
struggling
to
conceal
her
sufferings
she
took
off
her
shoes
and
attempted
to
walk
barefooted
but
the
road
was
covered
with
innumerable
flinty
rocks
the
sharp
points
lacerating
her
tender
feet
in
a
shocking
manner
it
made
my
heart
ache
to
see
the
stones
stained
with
the
blood
from
the
wounds
on
her
feet
and
i
told
harry
that
we
would
be
forced
to
stop
as
it
was
cruel
to
keep
her
on
the
road
in
the
condition
that
she
was
i
saw
the
tears
trembling
in
his
eyes
when
he
examined
his
sister
s
feet
we
came
to
a
little
creek
and
i
took
lottie
down
to
the
water
s
edge
and
bathed
her
feet
in
the
cold
water
and
wiped
them
with
my
handkerchief
i
then
procured
some
bark
and
made
a
kind
of
soft
plaster
of
it
and
covered
her
feet
with
it
then
bound
cloth
over
the
salve
and
was
gratified
to
hear
her
say
that
the
pain
was
greatly
relieved
it
was
but
a
few
moments
after
i
had
completed
my
doctoring
operations
when
a
farmer
came
along
the
road
driving
a
team
of
four
horses
he
invited
us
to
get
in
his
wagon
as
he
was
going
on
our
road
as
much
as
ten
miles
this
invitation
was
of
course
gladly
accepted
and
we
were
soon
seated
in
the
wagon
moving
on
leisurely
but
much
faster
than
we
had
been
in
the
habit
of
traveling
i
enjoyed
the
ride
more
on
lottie
s
account
than
on
any
other
knowing
as
i
did
that
it
was
giving
her
a
chance
to
there
s
the
gong
sounding
for
supper
cried
scottie
let
lottie
ride
in
the
wagon
till
we
the
party
rose
and
went
down
to
the
table
chapter
queen
mary
took
ingomar
s
arm
and
ivanhoe
offered
his
to
scottie
and
as
they
went
toward
the
saloon
scottie
said
to
ingomar
do
pray
tell
us
what
became
of
lottie
i
am
dying
with
curiosity
to
know
whether
you
married
her
or
you
had
better
allow
me
to
tell
the
story
in
my
own
way
he
replied
dryly
i
think
so
too
observed
the
queen
it
would
spoil
the
story
to
skip
from
one
part
to
another
let
us
after
supper
and
hear
more
of
i
think
the
queen
has
had
something
to
do
with
the
story
whispered
scottie
to
ivanhoe
she
has
been
constantly
wiping
the
tears
from
her
eyes
and
she
always
turned
her
face
another
way
endeavoring
to
conceal
her
emotion
and
i
could
see
her
hand
tremble
very
true
i
noticed
it
and
i
dare
say
that
she
knows
more
of
the
story
than
she
is
willing
to
tell
by
the
by
have
you
noticed
those
two
men
who
have
been
watching
us
all
the
time
no
pray
tell
me
about
i
have
a
suspicion
that
they
are
detectives
looking
for
some
one
who
has
committed
some
great
crime
i
accidentally
overheard
a
part
of
their
conversation
this
morning
one
of
them
pointed
at
one
of
our
party
and
said
he
is
the
which
one
of
our
party
did
he
point
at
what
further
did
you
hear
the
other
man
replied
that
there
was
no
doubt
about
are
you
sure
they
were
speaking
about
ingomar
they
pointed
at
him
and
i
therefore
concluded
that
the
conversation
referred
to
him
i
fear
that
our
amusements
will
be
broken
up
ere
i
hope
they
will
not
interfere
with
ingomar
until
he
finishes
his
yes
it
would
be
vexatious
to
have
it
cut
short
by
his
arrest
it
may
be
a
false
alarm
but
something
strange
is
going
on
the
movements
of
the
queen
have
excited
my
curiosity
more
than
anything
else
look
here
those
are
the
men
i
was
telling
you
about
see
how
they
are
eying
ingomar
don
t
let
them
see
you
looking
at
them
i
mean
to
try
to
unravel
the
i
can
t
think
that
ingomar
is
a
criminal
he
speaks
so
kindly
to
every
one
and
then
he
is
so
eloquent
when
telling
his
after
supper
the
party
on
deck
and
after
a
few
moments
spent
in
conversation
the
queen
ascended
her
throne
the
large
being
used
for
that
purpose
and
commanded
ingomar
to
proceed
with
his
story
in
obedience
to
the
queen
s
command
he
proceeded
as
follows
it
was
near
night
when
we
reached
the
point
where
the
farmer
informed
us
that
we
must
get
out
of
the
wagon
as
he
was
not
going
any
farther
on
our
road
there
was
an
old
dilapidated
vacant
house
near
the
point
where
we
parted
with
the
farmer
which
would
protect
us
from
a
that
was
then
threatening
to
burst
on
us
lottie
s
feet
were
so
much
swollen
and
so
badly
lacerated
that
she
was
unable
to
walk
at
all
and
i
lifted
her
from
the
wagon
and
carried
her
into
the
old
house
i
was
grieved
beyond
measure
to
witness
her
sufferings
for
in
addition
to
the
pain
she
was
suffering
on
account
of
her
wounded
feet
i
noticed
that
she
had
some
fever
our
condition
was
by
no
means
pleasant
in
fact
it
was
becoming
serious
our
provisions
were
exhausted
lottie
about
to
fall
ill
the
weather
prospects
gloomy
only
forty
miles
of
our
journey
completed
and
only
three
dollars
in
our
purse
the
prospects
were
of
a
nature
to
make
my
heart
sink
within
me
while
i
was
making
a
fire
harry
went
to
a
farmhouse
hard
by
to
purchase
provisions
he
bought
a
chicken
and
a
few
pounds
of
bread
from
a
widow
lady
for
cents
he
also
bought
a
little
tea
for
lottie
it
devolved
on
harry
to
prepare
supper
which
he
commenced
as
soon
as
he
had
returned
with
the
provisions
i
was
busily
engaged
in
making
a
bed
for
lottie
working
very
fast
so
as
to
get
it
finished
before
the
rain
should
begin
to
fall
the
lady
who
resided
at
the
permitted
me
to
take
some
dry
straw
from
a
pen
near
by
which
i
spread
out
on
the
floor
near
the
fire
placing
my
coat
on
the
straw
and
requested
lottie
to
lie
down
and
rest
until
we
could
make
her
some
tea
i
took
the
bandages
from
her
feet
bathed
them
in
cold
water
then
replaced
the
bandages
and
was
greatly
pleased
to
hear
her
say
that
she
was
much
better
and
felt
as
if
she
could
sleep
very
comfortably
you
must
not
go
to
sleep
said
harry
before
your
tea
is
ready
we
shall
soon
have
some
nice
broiled
chicken
and
good
tea
ready
for
i
shall
try
to
keep
awake
but
my
eyelids
begin
to
feel
very
heavy
i
assure
it
did
not
take
harry
many
minutes
to
cook
supper
and
it
made
me
very
happy
to
notice
that
lottie
partook
of
it
with
a
good
relish
well
said
she
brother
harry
you
must
permit
me
to
thank
you
for
making
such
good
tea
i
am
going
to
sleep
now
and
i
bid
you
and
eddie
and
it
was
but
a
short
time
till
she
was
sound
asleep
dark
clouds
began
to
collect
overhead
the
ominous
sounds
of
distant
thunder
gave
warning
of
the
approaching
storm
heavy
drops
of
rain
began
to
rattle
on
the
dry
boards
on
the
increasing
rapidly
until
it
fell
in
torrents
the
wind
dashed
with
great
force
against
the
tottering
walls
and
whistled
mournfully
among
the
trees
while
harry
and
i
sat
gazing
vacantly
into
the
fire
our
minds
busy
as
usual
castle
building
old
bob
had
managed
to
make
a
pretty
fair
supper
off
the
bones
of
the
chicken
and
such
other
scraps
as
he
could
find
and
was
licking
his
nose
with
apparent
satisfaction
as
he
coiled
himself
down
by
lottie
s
feet
it
was
after
midnight
the
rain
continued
to
fall
steadily
the
wind
blew
more
violently
the
fire
had
ceased
to
blaze
and
darkness
pervaded
the
room
harry
had
been
asleep
several
hours
and
i
was
dozing
near
the
hearth
when
i
was
startled
by
a
loud
shrill
scream
uttered
by
lottie
in
an
instant
harry
and
i
were
by
her
side
scream
followed
scream
while
old
bob
was
leaping
and
jumping
about
the
room
in
every
direction
such
confusion
as
appeared
was
beyond
my
comprehension
a
most
singular
noise
rang
through
the
darkness
slap
slap
crack
crack
and
old
bob
seemed
to
be
in
a
deadly
struggle
with
something
what
it
was
we
knew
not
lottie
kept
on
screaming
and
i
knew
that
something
awful
had
happened
because
she
was
no
coward
on
the
contrary
she
was
a
real
heroine
for
heaven
s
sake
make
a
light
said
i
to
harry
as
i
took
lottie
in
my
arms
he
obeyed
me
at
once
and
it
was
but
a
few
minutes
till
the
fire
began
to
blaze
so
as
to
light
up
the
room
though
it
seemed
to
me
it
was
a
very
long
time
what
in
heaven
s
name
has
happened
cried
harry
while
he
was
throwing
fuel
on
the
fire
and
trying
to
make
it
blaze
i
made
no
answer
of
course
for
i
was
busy
with
lottie
and
knew
as
little
of
the
cause
of
the
confusion
as
he
did
i
was
endeavoring
to
compose
lottie
who
was
trembling
like
one
with
an
ague
fit
every
now
and
then
i
felt
some
strange
substance
slap
against
my
legs
while
bob
threw
himself
first
one
way
then
another
struggling
as
if
he
was
fighting
for
life
what
is
it
darling
said
i
tell
me
what
has
happened
no
answer
but
i
felt
her
head
drop
heavily
on
my
shoulder
as
the
weight
of
her
body
came
against
my
breast
and
i
knew
she
had
either
fainted
or
was
dead
be
quick
harry
she
is
dead
do
pray
make
a
light
it
is
a
fact
that
when
one
gets
in
a
very
great
hurry
to
accomplish
anything
the
anxiety
to
do
it
quickly
very
often
prevents
him
from
doing
it
at
all
or
operates
greatly
to
delay
its
accomplishment
i
was
conjecturing
a
thousand
kinds
of
awful
things
that
had
happened
and
as
usual
in
such
cases
never
hit
near
the
real
one
the
first
thing
that
suggested
itself
to
my
mind
was
that
some
savage
wild
animal
had
come
into
the
room
and
had
frightened
lottie
there
were
at
that
time
many
bears
and
some
few
panthers
and
large
numbers
of
wolves
existing
in
that
part
of
the
state
and
i
thought
one
of
those
animals
had
ventured
in
the
house
i
heard
the
continuous
snapping
of
teeth
and
the
strangest
sounds
not
like
anything
i
had
ever
heard
before
i
spoke
sharply
to
harry
and
accused
him
of
a
want
of
feeling
for
his
sister
for
which
i
was
very
sorry
as
soon
as
the
words
had
passed
my
lips
he
was
so
frightened
that
he
hardly
knew
what
he
was
doing
at
last
the
fire
blazed
up
casting
a
bright
light
over
the
floor
when
i
was
almost
paralyzed
with
horror
at
the
spectacle
before
me
one
large
rattlesnake
lay
dead
at
my
feet
while
old
bob
was
shaking
the
life
out
of
another
of
equal
size
it
was
the
noise
made
by
the
rattles
on
the
tails
of
the
snakes
that
had
sounded
so
strangely
i
had
never
seen
a
rattlesnake
until
that
moment
and
therefore
did
not
know
what
was
making
such
a
singular
noise
lottie
lay
in
my
arms
as
pale
as
death
and
i
saw
that
she
had
been
bitten
on
the
wrist
by
one
of
the
snakes
there
were
two
small
holes
made
through
the
skin
and
two
little
drops
of
blood
had
come
out
through
the
wounds
the
flesh
had
already
begun
to
turn
a
yellowish
color
the
poisonous
fangs
had
been
driven
deep
into
the
flesh
and
the
deadly
venom
was
beginning
to
take
effect
i
suppose
the
snakes
had
come
up
through
the
crack
in
the
floor
and
had
perhaps
coiled
themselves
in
the
straw
near
lottie
and
that
in
her
restless
slumbers
she
had
struck
the
serpent
with
her
arm
and
thus
provoked
it
to
strike
because
the
rattlesnake
never
bites
unless
provoked
in
some
way
i
have
heard
it
said
too
that
they
always
go
in
pairs
and
i
had
also
heard
experienced
persons
say
that
the
safest
remedy
for
snake
bites
was
to
cut
out
the
flesh
in
which
the
fangs
had
struck
and
then
for
some
one
to
suck
the
wound
with
the
lips
so
as
to
extract
the
poison
as
soon
as
possible
fortunately
i
happened
to
have
in
my
pocket
a
knife
with
a
very
sharp
blade
without
a
moment
s
reflection
or
hesitation
i
seized
the
flesh
of
the
wrist
between
my
finger
and
thumb
and
cut
out
a
piece
large
enough
to
include
the
entire
wounds
made
by
the
poisonous
fangs
of
the
serpent
then
placed
my
lips
over
the
wound
and
began
to
suck
with
all
my
strength
the
wound
bled
freely
and
i
continued
to
suck
it
for
over
an
hour
lottie
had
immediately
regained
consciousness
after
the
cutting
of
her
wrist
and
held
her
wound
to
my
mouth
while
the
grateful
glance
which
she
cast
on
me
was
ample
compensation
for
the
risk
i
was
taking
we
could
not
then
tell
whether
she
was
suffering
much
or
not
for
one
of
her
peculiar
traits
was
never
to
complain
of
anything
but
she
declared
in
most
positive
terms
that
the
only
pain
she
experienced
was
the
slight
suffering
caused
by
the
wound
i
had
made
with
my
knife
on
her
wrist
after
sucking
the
wound
for
an
hour
i
began
to
feel
deathly
sick
a
strange
dizziness
seized
upon
me
the
house
appeared
to
be
turning
round
with
great
rapidity
and
a
blindness
fixed
itself
on
my
eyes
i
gasped
for
breath
and
felt
as
if
i
was
being
smothered
my
blood
seemed
to
be
boiling
hot
in
my
veins
i
sank
insensible
on
the
floor
and
when
i
regained
consciousness
i
was
on
a
clean
nice
bed
in
a
cozy
little
room
with
lottie
s
golden
curls
dangling
about
my
face
for
she
was
kissing
me
when
i
came
to
my
senses
and
my
face
was
moist
with
the
tears
that
had
fallen
from
her
dear
eyes
where
am
i
what
has
happened
were
the
questions
i
put
to
her
hush
eddie
dear
you
must
not
talk
you
have
been
dangerously
ill
and
oh
how
i
hate
myself
for
being
the
cause
of
your
illness
why
did
you
not
let
me
suffer
from
the
poison
instead
of
trying
to
kill
yourself
then
a
dim
recollection
of
what
had
happened
began
to
come
to
me
how
long
have
i
been
ill
five
days
and
oh
such
long
miserable
days
were
they
too
we
thought
you
were
going
to
die
and
that
made
us
so
very
unhappy
but
when
the
doctor
left
here
this
morning
he
said
that
all
danger
was
over
and
then
i
knew
that
god
had
answered
my
prayers
because
i
have
prayed
constantly
and
fervently
to
him
asking
him
not
to
let
you
die
if
you
had
died
i
should
have
looked
upon
myself
as
your
murderer
i
never
should
have
seen
another
happy
day
there
now
don
t
and
she
placed
her
hand
on
my
mouth
just
as
i
was
going
to
ask
more
questions
i
noticed
that
she
had
her
hand
in
a
sling
and
was
about
to
question
her
about
it
when
she
covered
my
mouth
with
her
hand
i
afterward
ascertained
that
she
had
not
been
entirely
relieved
from
pain
that
her
wrist
and
arm
had
been
very
much
swollen
and
had
caused
intense
suffering
but
that
she
had
watched
by
my
bedside
day
and
night
never
sleeping
any
except
such
short
naps
as
she
could
take
by
leaning
her
head
on
the
edge
of
my
bed
if
i
had
loved
her
before
this
and
i
assert
that
i
did
what
do
you
imagine
my
feelings
toward
her
were
then
it
would
require
a
more
expressive
term
to
describe
them
than
i
am
able
to
command
tell
me
lottie
all
that
has
happened
it
appears
like
a
i
will
if
you
promise
to
lie
still
and
keep
i
made
the
promise
reluctantly
when
you
fell
insensible
on
the
floor
from
the
effects
of
the
poison
which
you
had
sucked
from
my
wrist
i
began
to
scream
so
loud
that
holly
heard
it
and
she
and
her
son
came
to
see
what
the
matter
was
i
thought
that
you
were
dead
and
i
of
course
couldn
t
help
screaming
we
had
you
brought
to
this
house
and
harry
went
after
dodson
who
lives
five
miles
away
when
he
came
he
made
you
drunk
with
strong
brandy
then
gave
you
an
emetic
then
made
you
drunk
again
then
gave
you
another
emetic
he
kept
on
repeating
this
treatment
until
he
thought
all
the
poison
had
been
thrown
off
then
he
bled
you
until
you
fainted
then
he
gave
you
more
brandy
mixed
with
opiates
and
you
slept
a
long
time
but
you
kept
talking
all
the
time
in
your
sleep
about
me
and
the
snakes
the
good
doctor
remained
with
you
all
that
day
and
all
the
next
night
then
he
went
away
telling
us
that
all
danger
was
past
and
that
you
would
be
sure
to
get
well
which
of
course
made
us
very
happy
because
we
had
all
been
so
frightened
when
we
thought
you
were
going
to
die
doctor
dodson
said
that
there
was
a
slight
cut
or
wound
on
your
lip
and
that
when
sucking
my
wrist
the
poison
managed
to
make
its
way
through
that
little
wound
and
got
into
your
blood
thereby
causing
all
the
trouble
there
would
have
been
no
danger
he
said
but
for
the
wound
on
your
lip
he
said
you
were
the
greatest
little
hero
he
had
ever
heard
of
those
were
his
very
words
because
he
said
that
i
would
have
died
in
ten
minutes
from
the
poison
if
you
had
not
sucked
it
out
of
my
veins
harry
poor
fellow
has
been
working
all
the
time
in
the
field
to
pay
holly
for
our
board
and
when
we
get
done
paying
her
and
you
get
well
we
are
going
to
go
over
to
doctor
dodson
s
and
work
for
him
to
pay
him
for
saving
your
dear
life
and
when
we
have
finished
paying
the
doctor
we
will
then
start
on
our
journey
to
memphis
there
now
i
have
told
you
everything
take
this
beautiful
bouquet
in
your
hand
and
lie
perfectly
quiet
while
i
go
and
make
your
my
eyes
followed
the
lovely
form
till
she
disappeared
through
the
door
then
i
began
to
count
the
minutes
by
the
stroke
of
the
old
clock
on
the
mantel
and
the
wheels
of
time
seemed
to
stop
while
she
was
away
from
me
she
returned
at
last
here
is
a
nice
bowl
of
soup
and
you
must
drink
it
for
you
have
eaten
scarcely
anything
since
you
have
been
i
had
no
appetite
at
all
but
i
drank
the
soup
to
please
her
and
i
dare
say
it
did
me
much
good
for
i
was
very
weak
on
the
morning
of
the
eighth
day
of
my
illness
i
was
able
to
leave
my
bed
and
with
lottie
s
assistance
could
walk
across
the
room
then
the
next
morning
she
took
me
into
the
flower
garden
while
i
leaned
on
her
shoulder
for
support
i
was
very
much
gratified
to
see
that
all
the
wounds
on
lottie
s
feet
had
disappeared
and
that
she
could
wear
her
shoes
again
without
pain
and
i
determined
to
invent
some
plan
to
protect
her
feet
when
we
should
again
begin
our
journey
i
procured
some
strong
cloth
and
made
a
pair
of
shoes
sewing
leather
soles
on
the
bottom
so
as
to
prevent
the
stones
from
cutting
her
feet
the
cloth
uppers
would
keep
her
feet
from
blistering
while
the
thick
leather
soles
would
protect
them
from
the
gravel
she
watched
me
intently
while
the
work
progressed
and
when
it
was
finished
she
expressed
great
wonder
at
my
skill
the
truth
is
it
was
a
very
clumsy
job
and
the
shoes
were
ugly
but
they
answered
the
purpose
for
which
they
were
intended
for
she
never
was
troubled
any
more
with
blisters
or
sore
feet
we
had
been
at
holly
s
two
weeks
when
i
entirely
recovered
then
we
went
to
work
for
doctor
dodson
to
pay
his
bill
he
was
very
kind
to
us
his
bill
was
moderate
in
fact
he
was
willing
to
let
us
go
without
paying
anything
but
harry
would
not
hear
to
it
he
vowed
he
never
would
leave
until
the
last
cent
was
paid
i
always
thought
he
had
very
strange
views
on
such
subjects
he
was
too
sensitive
i
imagined
because
he
abhorred
the
idea
of
accepting
anything
like
charity
i
do
believe
he
would
have
starved
rather
than
to
eat
bread
for
which
he
was
unable
to
pay
we
remained
with
the
doctor
ten
days
during
which
time
harry
and
i
plowed
a
large
field
of
corn
and
cleaned
out
all
the
grass
lottie
insisted
on
being
permitted
to
help
us
but
harry
would
not
allow
it
therefore
she
went
to
work
in
the
garden
and
i
mean
what
i
say
when
i
assert
that
it
is
my
candid
opinion
that
garden
never
before
had
been
in
such
a
splendid
fix
she
destroyed
every
weed
and
blade
of
grass
cultivated
the
vegetables
trimmed
the
shrubbery
transplanted
the
flowers
in
fact
she
made
an
eden
out
of
a
wilderness
when
the
work
was
finished
the
old
doctor
was
profuse
in
his
praise
i
declare
said
he
as
he
gently
stroked
lottie
s
hair
i
have
been
amply
rewarded
for
my
attendance
on
your
brother
by
your
services
to
say
nothing
of
the
valuable
work
done
on
my
farm
by
harry
and
edward
i
wish
all
my
patients
would
pay
me
as
well
as
i
have
been
paid
in
this
instance
if
they
did
i
should
soon
grow
very
rich
i
will
not
allow
you
to
work
another
lick
and
when
you
wish
to
start
on
your
journey
you
shall
have
as
much
provisions
as
your
two
brothers
can
the
morning
after
this
conversation
we
parted
from
our
kind
host
and
set
out
on
our
journey
toward
memphis
loaded
down
with
nicely
cooked
provisions
chapter
vi
it
was
on
a
friday
morning
that
we
parted
from
doctor
dodson
the
weather
was
getting
to
be
uncomfortably
warm
and
we
were
compelled
to
travel
very
slowly
lest
lottie
should
be
prostrated
by
the
heat
ten
miles
a
day
was
the
average
distance
which
we
marched
we
usually
started
at
sunrise
walked
five
miles
then
rested
in
the
shade
until
four
o
clock
and
marched
the
other
five
miles
by
dark
as
we
had
determined
not
to
travel
on
the
sabbath
we
began
early
in
the
day
on
saturday
to
look
for
a
cool
shady
spot
where
we
might
rest
comfortably
until
monday
morning
shade
and
pure
water
were
two
articles
that
must
be
found
adjacent
to
each
other
before
we
could
expect
to
pass
the
time
pleasantly
we
however
had
the
good
luck
to
come
to
a
spring
where
many
large
trees
stood
all
overgrown
with
making
a
covering
not
only
sufficient
to
keep
off
the
hot
rays
of
the
sun
but
a
shelter
that
would
have
protected
us
from
a
heavy
shower
of
rain
it
proved
to
be
an
unfortunate
spot
for
us
as
an
occurrence
happened
there
that
gave
us
a
great
deal
of
trouble
the
place
where
we
halted
was
only
one
mile
from
the
and
it
was
from
this
village
that
the
source
of
our
troubles
came
it
was
sunday
evening
we
had
finished
our
humble
supper
and
were
all
engaged
in
singing
an
old
favorite
song
i
suppose
that
it
was
our
singing
that
attracted
the
attention
of
some
rude
boys
from
the
village
there
were
three
boys
in
the
gang
that
came
up
to
where
we
were
seated
the
leader
a
lad
whom
i
supposed
to
be
about
fifteen
years
of
age
whose
features
exhibited
unmistakable
signs
of
dissipation
and
brutality
the
other
two
were
much
younger
and
appeared
more
genteel
the
leader
whose
name
i
afterward
learned
was
benjamin
bowles
in
a
domineering
tone
said
is
this
a
or
a
gipsy
camp
neither
sir
harry
replied
is
it
a
or
a
then
no
sir
it
is
neither
a
nor
a
then
what
in
the
deuce
is
it
it
is
no
business
of
yours
sir
and
we
would
be
much
obliged
if
you
would
let
us
oh
would
you
now
see
here
little
sweetheart
i
ll
give
you
a
dollar
for
one
of
those
pretty
and
he
reached
out
his
hand
to
take
hold
of
lottie
s
hair
she
blushed
and
moved
to
harry
s
side
i
felt
the
blood
in
my
veins
begin
to
boil
and
the
demon
to
rise
within
my
heart
you
had
better
go
away
and
leave
us
alone
said
harry
as
he
made
a
movement
toward
the
boy
now
do
you
really
think
so
said
he
sneeringly
what
a
polite
nice
boy
you
are
i
thought
harry
was
going
to
strike
him
but
lottie
laid
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
don
t
have
any
difficulty
with
him
brother
he
will
go
away
directly
she
said
softly
now
that
s
a
daisy
my
little
queen
he
said
let
us
be
the
other
two
boys
seemed
to
be
disgusted
with
the
rude
conduct
of
their
comrade
and
began
to
persuade
him
to
go
with
them
back
to
the
village
and
when
he
peremptorily
refused
they
went
away
and
left
him
let
us
drink
and
be
friends
said
he
as
he
drew
a
flask
of
brandy
from
his
pocket
and
presented
it
to
harry
who
of
course
refused
then
offering
it
to
me
you
ll
drink
with
me
i
know
won
t
you
old
boy
well
indeed
i
must
say
that
i
never
met
such
uncivil
fellows
in
my
life
if
you
won
t
drink
suppose
we
have
a
then
he
began
to
caper
about
like
a
madman
if
you
won
t
drink
nor
dance
suppose
we
have
a
boxing
then
he
threw
himself
in
an
attitude
supposed
to
be
that
of
an
experienced
pugilist
give
me
a
drink
of
water
then
he
said
and
i
will
leave
i
went
immediately
to
the
spring
to
fetch
him
some
water
in
order
to
get
rid
of
him
the
spring
was
over
a
hundred
yards
from
our
camp
i
had
arrived
at
the
spring
and
had
stooped
to
dip
up
the
water
when
i
heard
lottie
calling
me
come
quick
eddie
she
screamed
he
is
killing
harry
i
got
there
as
soon
as
i
could
the
boy
was
gone
and
the
blood
was
streaming
over
harry
s
face
from
a
wound
on
his
head
the
boy
had
evidently
sent
me
off
after
water
on
purpose
to
have
a
chance
to
abuse
harry
because
as
soon
as
i
was
gone
he
seized
lottie
by
the
wrist
and
attempted
to
kiss
her
when
harry
struck
him
on
the
head
with
a
small
stick
then
he
threw
harry
down
being
much
larger
and
stronger
than
he
was
and
began
to
beat
him
when
old
bob
seized
bowles
by
the
leg
tearing
the
flesh
to
the
bone
then
the
boy
quickly
released
harry
and
scampered
off
vowing
that
he
would
have
revenge
harry
was
not
seriously
hurt
and
very
soon
we
were
all
asleep
we
had
scarcely
finished
breakfast
next
morning
when
the
town
marshal
came
out
and
arrested
all
of
us
saying
that
bowles
had
caused
a
warrant
to
be
issued
against
harry
for
an
assault
and
battery
committed
on
him
we
were
required
to
go
with
the
marshal
to
the
mayor
s
office
where
we
were
ordered
to
wait
until
that
individual
should
finish
his
morning
nap
we
had
been
there
about
two
hours
when
his
honor
came
bustling
in
falstaff
would
have
appeared
lean
by
the
side
of
this
moving
mountain
of
fat
he
was
the
largest
man
i
ever
saw
the
greasy
rolls
of
flesh
under
his
chin
lay
in
waves
on
his
breast
his
jaws
bulged
out
like
the
jaws
of
a
fat
hog
and
a
couple
of
teeth
in
the
corners
of
his
mouth
stuck
out
over
his
lips
like
the
tusks
of
a
wild
boar
two
little
bunches
of
hair
on
the
sides
of
his
head
were
all
he
had
the
red
skin
on
top
of
his
head
was
sleek
and
glistened
like
polished
metal
what
have
you
got
for
me
this
morning
mr
marshal
he
inquired
as
he
seated
himself
by
a
table
and
began
to
adjust
his
spectacles
on
his
large
nose
we
have
two
cases
for
trial
this
morning
sir
said
a
foppish
young
man
one
criminal
case
and
one
civil
ah
good
we
ll
try
the
civil
suit
the
plaintiff
in
the
civil
suit
was
a
woman
with
a
forlorn
forsaken
appearance
who
sat
on
a
bench
with
a
infant
in
her
arms
when
she
stood
up
to
be
sworn
as
a
witness
she
was
compelled
to
lean
on
the
table
to
keep
from
falling
what
is
your
complaint
madame
against
judge
bosh
demanded
the
mayor
gruffly
as
he
stared
savagely
at
the
poor
woman
in
a
low
tremulous
tone
she
stated
her
case
i
contracted
with
judge
bosh
to
work
for
him
three
months
for
six
dollars
per
month
i
worked
for
him
for
two
months
and
then
fell
ill
so
that
i
was
unable
to
work
any
more
he
refused
to
pay
me
because
i
was
unable
to
work
the
other
quarter
of
a
month
as
soon
as
i
got
able
to
walk
i
went
back
and
offered
to
work
out
my
contract
but
he
said
that
it
was
too
late
that
he
had
made
other
arrangements
we
are
out
of
provisions
at
home
sir
and
i
hope
you
will
make
the
judge
pay
me
for
the
work
i
have
done
for
no
doubt
you
do
no
doubt
you
do
growled
the
fountain
of
justice
as
he
told
the
plaintiff
to
stand
aside
what
has
the
defendant
got
to
say
and
he
smiled
blandly
on
judge
bosh
as
that
distinguished
individual
stepped
forward
and
laid
his
hand
on
the
bible
it
is
unnecessary
to
swear
you
please
make
your
that
woman
contracted
to
serve
me
three
months
she
failed
to
comply
with
her
contract
as
to
her
reasons
i
know
nothing
about
them
neither
do
i
wish
to
know
a
contract
is
a
contract
and
it
binds
both
parties
she
violated
it
and
i
demand
certainly
certainly
judge
most
assuredly
you
are
clearly
entitled
to
it
judgment
against
plaintiff
for
cost
he
muttered
as
he
wrote
down
the
entry
on
his
docket
the
poor
woman
staggered
out
of
the
room
and
fell
fainting
on
the
pavement
what
s
next
mr
marshal
a
charge
of
assault
and
battery
against
harry
is
that
the
little
scamp
who
tried
to
murder
our
esteemed
young
friend
bowles
he
looks
like
a
rascal
i
ll
teach
him
a
lesson
that
he
ll
not
forget
soon
o
lord
how
wicked
this
world
is
getting
to
be
and
he
attempted
to
sigh
but
it
was
a
savage
growl
bowles
was
sworn
as
a
witness
he
took
the
stand
and
commenced
uttering
falsehoods
from
the
start
i
was
almost
struck
dumb
with
astonishment
at
his
total
disregard
of
the
solemn
oath
he
had
made
to
tell
the
truth
the
whole
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
he
wore
a
bandage
on
his
head
and
pretended
to
be
suffering
intense
pain
from
the
wound
on
it
while
he
had
his
leg
in
a
sling
he
stated
that
he
had
been
attracted
to
the
camp
by
the
singing
and
that
as
soon
as
he
arrived
there
he
was
insulted
and
abused
in
a
most
rude
and
vulgar
manner
by
the
two
boys
the
girl
joining
in
with
them
he
said
that
while
his
back
was
turned
toward
the
defendant
he
was
knocked
down
with
a
club
and
the
savage
dog
set
on
him
lacerating
the
flesh
of
his
leg
that
as
soon
as
he
was
able
to
regain
his
feet
he
had
made
his
way
home
completely
prostrated
from
loss
of
shocking
shocking
growled
the
mayor
savagely
as
he
began
to
open
and
shut
his
mouth
rapidly
i
wish
i
had
the
power
to
send
all
of
them
to
the
penitentiary
they
are
traveling
thieves
no
we
are
no
thieves
sir
exclaimed
harry
springing
to
his
feet
the
insinuation
is
false
silence
sir
how
dare
you
insult
this
honorable
court
i
guess
i
ll
put
you
where
you
won
t
have
a
chance
to
murder
anybody
soon
any
other
witnesses
bowles
no
sir
said
bowles
meekly
that
s
have
you
any
witnesses
sir
he
said
to
harry
my
sister
was
present
sir
and
knows
all
about
of
course
of
course
she
was
present
and
i
suppose
you
expect
me
to
believe
what
she
has
to
say
ha
she
will
tell
you
the
truth
sir
and
nothing
but
the
truth
and
i
hope
no
insinuation
will
be
made
to
the
ah
no
doubt
come
here
gal
and
be
sworn
and
be
sure
you
confine
yourself
to
the
facts
what
are
you
shaking
that
way
for
nobody
wants
to
eat
you
put
your
hand
on
this
lottie
was
very
much
frightened
and
was
trembling
like
an
aspen
leaf
tears
were
streaming
down
her
cheeks
and
i
stepped
to
her
side
to
her
take
your
seat
sir
and
let
her
tell
her
own
story
said
the
mayor
as
he
thrust
his
huge
finger
at
my
nose
i
obeyed
reluctantly
and
lottie
began
to
tell
her
version
of
the
matter
a
large
crowd
of
spectators
had
come
in
to
witness
the
proceedings
and
i
perceived
that
the
eloquent
manner
in
which
she
was
delivering
her
evidence
was
winning
the
sympathies
of
the
crowd
i
saw
several
of
the
spectators
wiping
tears
from
their
eyes
while
she
was
describing
the
death
of
her
mother
and
telling
how
she
and
her
brothers
were
trying
to
get
to
their
uncle
at
memphis
her
extreme
beauty
and
modesty
the
sweet
melody
of
her
voice
and
the
simplicity
of
her
pleading
to
some
extent
softened
the
marble
heart
of
the
mayor
she
began
to
regain
her
as
the
story
of
her
sufferings
came
from
her
lips
the
brutal
old
official
leaned
back
in
his
chair
with
his
mouth
wide
open
gazing
with
wonder
at
the
angelic
creature
before
him
lottie
seemed
to
have
lost
sight
of
the
case
before
the
court
but
she
began
to
plead
for
her
brother
with
such
persuasive
eloquence
that
every
man
in
the
house
was
moved
to
tears
she
gave
a
graphic
description
of
her
adventure
with
the
rattlesnakes
showed
her
wounded
wrist
to
the
court
which
had
been
nearly
healed
up
when
it
was
badly
hurt
again
by
the
violence
of
benjamin
bowles
who
had
insulted
her
and
hurt
her
wounded
arm
at
the
same
time
cowardly
villain
was
he
to
insult
my
darling
little
flower
queen
exclaimed
doctor
dodson
as
he
hurriedly
caught
lottie
in
his
arms
and
pressed
a
kiss
on
her
brow
where
is
the
cowardly
wretch
who
has
dared
to
insult
this
poor
orphan
child
let
me
see
his
face
i
ll
venture
the
assertion
that
it
is
more
like
a
beast
s
than
a
man
s
bowles
limped
out
of
the
room
being
careful
to
keep
behind
the
crowd
as
he
passed
out
looking
as
if
he
had
important
business
that
required
his
immediate
attention
at
some
other
place
bowles
limped
out
of
the

being
careful
to
keep

crowd
as

passed
out
looking
as
if
he
had
important
business
that
required
his

at

place
why
my
dear
doctor
how
do
you
come
on
i
declare
i
m
delighted
to
see
you
exclaimed
the
mayor
seizing
the
doctor
s
hand
and
making
an
obsequious
bow
i
am
glad
to
see
that
you
know
this
little
lady
i
dare
say
you
will
be
able
to
throw
some
light
on
the
matter
now
before
the
i
should
say
i
did
know
that
darling
little
orphan
child
i
know
she
is
the
sweetest
little
lady
in
the
land
and
who
dares
to
say
otherwise
yes
and
i
know
those
two
boys
there
pointing
to
harry
and
me
any
one
who
has
aught
to
say
against
them
let
him
say
it
now
in
my
presence
the
good
old
doctor
was
very
much
excited
as
he
continued
to
defend
our
side
of
the
case
having
exhausted
himself
he
dropped
into
a
chair
and
began
to
wipe
the
large
drops
of
perspiration
from
his
brow
and
as
he
blew
his
nose
he
gave
a
snort
that
startled
every
man
in
the
room
the
mayor
seemed
to
be
at
a
loss
how
to
proceed
for
he
was
afraid
to
offend
doctor
dodson
who
had
been
his
family
physician
for
many
years
besides
this
he
was
largely
indebted
to
the
doctor
and
it
was
not
exactly
convenient
for
him
to
pay
the
debt
just
then
on
the
other
hand
benjamin
bowles
was
the
son
of
a
merchant
to
whom
he
was
owing
a
very
considerable
sum
and
he
was
anxious
to
decide
the
case
so
as
not
to
offend
him
the
idea
of
deciding
the
case
according
to
the
rules
of
law
and
justice
from
the
evidence
never
for
a
moment
came
into
his
mind
my
dear
doctor
said
the
mayor
as
he
scrambled
up
from
his
seat
let
me
consult
with
you
a
moment
the
doctor
followed
him
into
a
private
room
when
the
mayor
said
doctor
what
do
you
know
about
those
three
children
i
know
enough
to
convince
me
that
the
boys
are
heroes
and
that
the
girl
is
a
lovely
little
heroine
i
know
that
they
are
friendless
orphans
which
should
entitle
them
to
the
sympathies
of
all
good
men
i
know
that
any
one
who
would
oppress
or
wrong
them
ought
to
go
to
the
yes
yes
i
know
doctor
i
ll
discharge
them
at
you
should
never
have
molested
them
at
first
what
business
had
that
bowles
boy
at
their
camp
i
should
like
to
know
you
knew
that
he
was
the
meanest
most
unprincipled
boy
in
this
county
and
i
am
surprised
that
you
should
so
far
have
forgotten
yourself
as
to
have
those
poor
helpless
children
dragged
into
court
as
if
they
were
thieves
now
that
s
what
i
think
of
the
whole
business
you
go
in
there
and
discharge
those
children
immediately
else
we
are
enemies
for
oh
my
dear
doctor
i
beseech
you
don
t
for
a
moment
imagine
that
i
would
oppress
the
orphans
or
deal
harshly
with
the
helpless
i
was
going
to
discharge
them
anyway
i
was
merely
investigating
the
case
for
form
s
sake
you
know
one
has
to
appear
stern
and
unbending
sometimes
while
his
heart
is
melting
with
yes
i
know
how
it
is
i
have
long
been
acquainted
with
the
secret
goodness
of
your
heart
i
wonder
how
you
could
keep
it
smothered
so
ah
doc
one
in
my
position
has
much
to
contend
with
it
s
a
difficult
thing
to
hold
the
scales
of
justice
so
as
to
be
impartial
i
am
not
fit
to
be
in
office
my
heart
is
too
tender
i
can
t
keep
from
sympathizing
with
the
weak
and
helpless
even
when
they
have
violated
the
law
i
think
i
shall
i
would
if
i
were
you
your
heart
is
too
tender
for
the
place
but
let
us
go
in
and
have
the
children
the
mayor
resumed
his
seat
adjusted
his
spectacles
and
deliberately
surveyed
the
crowd
my
young
friend
wallingford
we
have
had
some
difficulty
in
arriving
at
a
correct
conclusion
respecting
our
duty
in
this
case
we
have
patiently
listened
to
the
evidence
pro
and
con
and
find
in
many
respects
a
great
conflict
that
is
to
say
somewhat
of
a
contradiction
between
the
statements
made
by
bowles
and
the
evidence
given
by
miss
wallingford
but
i
am
pleased
to
be
able
to
say
that
it
is
the
opinion
of
the
court
that
no
willful
perjury
has
been
committed
in
this
case
but
the
apparent
conflict
grew
out
of
the
confusion
caused
by
the
interference
of
that
savage
old
dog
in
the
little
unpleasantness
the
court
very
much
regrets
that
it
has
no
power
to
imprison
dogs
or
to
impose
fines
upon
them
this
is
more
especially
to
be
regretted
in
this
case
as
it
is
the
opinion
of
the
court
that
the
dog
is
the
only
man
to
blame
in
the
matter
that
being
true
and
as
there
is
no
lawful
authority
given
me
to
punish
the
dog
as
he
deserves
i
am
consequently
compelled
to
dismiss
master
wallingford
from
custody
and
tax
the
corporation
with
the
cost
i
would
admonish
my
young
friend
to
endeavor
to
teach
his
dog
better
manners
in
future
lest
he
might
involve
his
master
in
some
serious
trouble
adjourn
court
mr
marshal
and
don
t
fail
to
collect
the
cost
in
the
case
of
bonds
against
judge
now
let
the
curtain
fall
for
the
farce
is
finished
it
was
a
lucky
thing
for
us
that
doctor
dodson
came
to
town
that
day
for
harry
would
have
been
sent
to
prison
but
for
his
timely
arrival
lottie
threw
her
arms
round
the
old
gentleman
s
neck
and
kissed
him
fervently
and
i
saw
the
tears
trembling
in
his
eyes
as
he
pressed
her
to
his
heart
heaven
bless
you
my
child
said
he
i
had
a
daughter
about
your
age
but
she
is
dead
poor
thing
she
was
very
much
like
you
and
should
you
ever
need
a
home
come
to
me
and
you
ll
find
i
thank
you
so
very
much
much
more
than
words
can
express
and
i
hope
god
will
reward
you
there
there
child
hush
or
you
ll
make
a
fool
of
me
and
he
left
the
room
with
the
brim
of
his
hat
pulled
down
over
his
eyes
to
hide
his
tears
once
more
we
were
permitted
to
renew
our
march
on
the
road
to
memphis
and
during
the
next
three
days
nothing
occurred
worthy
of
mention
we
were
happy
because
lottie
kept
up
so
well
she
was
so
cheerful
and
never
complained
the
cloth
shoes
i
had
made
for
her
proved
a
great
success
no
more
blisters
appeared
on
her
feet
the
weather
though
quite
warm
during
the
day
was
pleasant
mornings
and
evenings
while
the
nights
were
delightful
we
continued
our
gipsy
plan
of
camping
out
nights
and
traveled
leisurely
during
the
day
so
as
not
to
fatigue
lottie
but
as
i
hear
the
music
in
the
saloon
which
is
the
signal
for
the
dance
to
commence
i
shall
break
off
the
thread
here
and
promise
to
take
it
up
again
when
her
majesty
shall
be
pleased
to
command
i
had
rather
listen
to
the
story
than
to
dance
said
scottie
so
would
i
said
the
queen
but
just
then
the
band
struck
up
a
lively
air
and
the
temptation
of
the
dance
proved
irresistible
for
the
majority
of
the
maskers
hastened
to
the
cabin
and
the
others
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
follow
chapter
vii
it
required
no
summons
to
be
issued
by
the
queen
next
morning
in
order
to
assemble
her
followers
they
were
on
deck
immediately
after
breakfast
long
before
the
queen
made
her
appearance
anxiously
waiting
to
hear
more
of
the
tale
therefore
when
her
majesty
made
her
appearance
ingomar
was
at
once
requested
to
proceed
which
he
did
without
preliminaries
incidents
apparently
trifling
oftentimes
shape
our
destiny
but
in
making
this
statement
i
do
not
mean
to
convey
the
impression
that
i
am
about
to
describe
a
trifling
incident
but
the
insignificant
circumstances
which
caused
the
incident
are
what
i
refer
to
had
it
not
been
for
an
old
stray
dog
that
happened
to
take
a
fancy
to
lottie
and
concluded
to
cast
his
destiny
with
her
there
would
have
been
no
use
telling
this
story
old
bob
was
fond
of
chasing
rabbits
one
day
he
started
one
the
rabbit
ran
for
life
bob
ran
for
the
rabbit
the
rabbit
ran
in
a
certain
direction
bob
ran
in
the
same
direction
he
followed
the
rabbit
and
we
followed
him
while
doing
so
we
came
to
a
gravel
pit
which
gravel
pit
i
am
sure
we
never
would
have
seen
had
bob
not
started
the
rabbit
but
as
he
did
start
it
thereby
causing
us
to
go
to
the
gravel
pit
i
shall
proceed
to
tell
what
followed
a
large
number
of
men
were
shoveling
the
gravel
onto
flat
cars
to
be
hauled
on
the
line
of
the
railroad
for
ballasting
the
track
the
rabbit
took
refuge
in
a
hollow
tree
near
where
the
men
were
at
work
they
came
and
cut
the
tree
down
and
caught
the
rabbit
we
sat
down
near
the
gravel
pit
to
rest
the
foreman
invited
us
to
ride
on
the
gravel
train
to
the
next
station
which
was
directly
on
our
road
we
were
delighted
at
the
prospect
of
a
ride
on
the
cars
and
what
made
it
most
desirable
was
the
fact
that
it
would
put
us
ten
miles
nearer
memphis
in
a
few
minutes
whereas
it
would
be
a
good
day
s
walk
if
we
had
to
foot
it
we
thanked
the
foreman
heartily
and
accepted
his
kind
offer
hurry
up
my
men
said
the
foreman
as
he
looked
at
his
watch
throw
in
lively
we
have
no
time
to
spare
for
we
must
get
to
the
station
before
the
passenger
the
men
threw
the
gravel
on
the
cars
with
great
rapidity
and
very
soon
the
flats
were
loaded
and
the
train
began
to
move
lottie
and
i
took
seats
on
the
car
next
to
the
engine
while
harry
went
forward
to
ride
on
the
pilot
my
little
man
said
the
engineer
to
harry
it
is
very
dangerous
to
ride
on
the
pilot
you
had
better
not
attempt
it
as
we
are
compelled
to
run
very
rapidly
so
as
to
reach
the
station
before
the
passenger
i
was
astonished
to
see
that
harry
paid
no
attention
to
the
warning
it
was
so
different
from
his
usual
way
of
doing
things
it
was
i
who
had
been
considered
reckless
while
harry
was
looked
upon
as
the
embodiment
of
prudence
and
wisdom
lottie
called
to
her
brother
begging
him
to
come
back
and
ride
with
her
but
he
sat
immovable
and
silent
without
turning
his
head
to
notice
her
harry
afterward
informed
me
that
a
strange
unaccountable
desire
to
ride
on
the
pilot
of
the
engine
seized
upon
him
and
he
could
not
resist
it
it
may
be
imagination
merely
said
he
but
i
thought
something
whispered
to
my
mind
positively
directing
me
to
ride
there
i
had
the
inclination
to
heed
the
warning
of
the
engineer
but
a
most
mysterious
influence
seemed
to
rivet
me
down
to
the
spot
so
i
could
not
move
i
have
heard
that
notice
of
approaching
events
was
often
conveyed
to
the
human
mind
through
the
medium
of
dreams
but
in
my
case
the
notice
came
while
i
was
wide
awake
and
in
a
manner
to
me
incomprehensible
and
most
mysterious
call
it
superstition
if
you
will
call
it
nonsense
if
you
choose
i
care
not
i
state
facts
and
you
may
draw
your
own
i
did
not
argue
the
question
with
him
for
i
perceived
that
he
was
deeply
in
earnest
and
his
manner
was
so
serious
that
i
thought
best
to
say
nothing
against
his
strange
theory
let
her
run
dan
said
the
conductor
to
the
engineer
as
he
held
his
watch
in
his
hand
only
ten
minutes
till
number
four
is
due
at
the
station
and
eight
miles
to
the
engineer
who
had
a
frank
open
countenance
and
keen
intelligent
eyes
and
hair
seized
the
lever
and
gave
a
backward
pull
and
the
engine
dashed
forward
like
a
ball
discharged
from
a
siege
gun
fences
trees
and
houses
all
seemed
to
be
flying
the
wind
whistled
about
harry
s
face
and
played
with
his
hair
as
it
floated
straight
out
behind
his
head
he
held
his
hat
in
his
hand
while
his
face
was
all
aglow
with
excitement
you
had
better
order
that
boy
away
from
the
pilot
said
the
engineer
to
the
conductor
as
he
opened
the
throttle
to
let
on
more
steam
he
might
get
hurt
where
he
is
we
are
taking
great
risk
anyway
the
track
you
know
is
very
crooked
from
here
to
the
station
if
a
cow
or
hog
or
anything
should
be
on
the
track
he
would
be
you
had
better
not
ride
there
my
little
man
said
the
conductor
it
is
very
harry
sat
immovable
as
if
he
had
been
fastened
there
with
bolts
of
steel
while
the
train
flew
onward
at
the
extraordinary
speed
of
a
mile
per
minute
it
is
very
probable
that
harry
did
not
hear
the
warning
given
by
the
conductor
as
the
noise
made
by
the
engine
as
it
thundered
on
may
have
prevented
it
at
all
events
he
did
not
move
he
was
rapidly
approaching
his
destiny
whether
that
destiny
was
for
weal
or
woe
will
be
a
matter
for
after
consideration
harry
always
contended
that
it
was
a
supernatural
influence
that
compelled
him
to
take
his
seat
on
the
pilot
of
that
particular
engine
at
that
particular
time
he
said
that
the
influence
or
whatever
it
was
came
upon
him
with
such
unmistakable
distinctness
that
he
would
have
resisted
any
attempt
to
force
him
away
the
more
i
ridiculed
the
idea
the
more
firmly
did
he
stick
to
it
it
was
providence
said
he
that
is
i
wonder
if
providence
made
old
bob
start
the
rabbit
merely
to
guide
us
to
the
gravel
pit
said
i
no
doubt
of
it
was
his
reply
i
didn
t
know
before
now
that
you
were
so
full
of
if
it
is
superstition
to
believe
that
providence
prompted
me
to
ride
on
the
engine
that
day
then
i
am
overflowed
with
the
brave
old
engineer
stood
with
his
hand
on
the
lever
his
sleeves
rolled
above
his
elbows
his
face
blackened
with
smut
and
smoke
his
gray
locks
pushed
back
and
streaming
in
the
wind
undaunted
courage
was
stamped
on
every
feature
his
lips
were
firmly
closed
and
the
picture
he
presented
reminded
me
of
the
description
of
vulcan
which
i
had
read
in
homer
will
she
make
it
dan
inquired
the
conductor
yes
i
think
so
replied
the
engineer
but
it
will
be
a
close
race
two
miles
to
run
two
minutes
and
a
quarter
to
make
it
we
re
safe
then
said
the
conductor
they
can
hear
us
coming
and
will
wait
for
within
one
mile
of
the
station
there
was
a
sharp
curve
in
the
track
where
it
swung
round
the
base
of
a
tall
ridge
then
lay
out
on
the
top
of
a
very
high
embankment
thence
across
a
bridge
with
a
straight
run
from
there
to
the
station
the
train
was
coming
round
the
curve
with
unusual
speed
as
it
was
running
down
grade
harry
sat
on
the
pilot
with
his
eyes
fixed
in
front
and
just
as
the
train
came
round
the
last
spur
of
the
ridge
he
saw
a
little
girl
sitting
on
the
gravel
in
the
center
of
the
track
with
her
apron
filled
with
wild
flowers
which
she
was
busily
weaving
into
festoons
the
train
was
within
one
hundred
yards
of
her
before
she
was
discovered
she
was
on
the
part
of
the
track
that
lay
on
the
top
of
the
high
embankment
the
sides
of
which
were
very
steep
and
it
was
full
thirty
feet
to
the
ground
from
where
the
little
girl
sat
the
engineer
immediately
blew
the
signal
for
down
brakes
then
reversed
his
engine
a
very
dangerous
operation
to
perform
while
running
rapidly
down
grade
all
the
brakes
were
put
on
and
the
brakeman
seemed
to
strain
every
nerve
to
hold
them
as
much
down
as
possible
the
engineer
kept
his
whistle
shrieking
and
screaming
in
order
to
warn
the
child
of
her
danger
she
rose
and
started
to
run
toward
the
bridge
then
hesitated
a
moment
and
made
a
move
as
if
she
were
going
to
jump
over
the
embankment
an
irish
woman
who
was
the
child
s
nurse
had
imprudently
left
her
on
the
track
while
she
was
gathering
the
flowers
some
distance
from
it
when
the
nurse
discovered
the
danger
to
which
the
little
girl
was
exposed
she
hallooed
to
the
child
telling
her
to
leap
down
the
side
of
the
embankment
she
made
a
movement
as
if
she
were
going
to
do
it
then
evidently
became
frightened
at
the
great
distance
to
the
ground
meantime
the
train
was
rapidly
approaching
the
spot
where
the
child
was
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
all
the
brakes
were
down
and
the
engine
reversed
the
momentum
was
so
great
and
the
grade
being
downward
the
train
continued
to
move
forward
the
noise
made
by
the
whistle
added
to
the
thundering
sounds
made
by
the
approaching
train
only
served
to
increase
the
child
s
confusion
the
second
time
she
started
to
run
across
the
bridge
and
again
she
ran
back
a
few
paces
then
became
so
paralyzed
with
fright
that
she
stopped
unable
to
move
the
train
was
within
a
few
feet
of
the
little
girl
and
it
now
became
certain
that
the
engine
could
not
be
stopped
before
it
reached
the
bridge
although
it
was
running
quite
slowly
not
faster
than
a
man
could
run
but
what
did
that
signify
wouldn
t
the
child
be
crushed
to
death
unless
the
engine
could
be
stopped
before
she
was
reached
it
was
plain
to
be
seen
that
the
little
girl
had
lost
her
and
she
stood
gazing
at
the
approaching
train
in
despair
she
had
very
long
hair
which
floated
loose
down
her
back
while
the
flowers
lay
scattered
on
the
ground
where
she
stood
the
picture
she
presented
then
was
pretty
tis
true
but
the
situation
was
awful
my
heart
grew
sick
at
the
sight
i
noticed
harry
getting
down
on
the
very
front
of
the
iron
frame
commonly
called
the
but
what
good
could
he
do
by
that
the
engine
was
within
ten
feet
of
the
little
girl
when
i
saw
the
old
engineer
turn
his
face
away
and
throw
both
hands
to
his
eyes
as
if
he
were
trying
to
shut
out
the
shocking
scene
that
was
about
to
be
witnessed
oh
great
god
have
mercy
on
us
he
exclaimed
as
he
turned
away
harry
placed
his
foot
on
the
outer
end
of
the
longest
bar
of
iron
then
made
a
desperate
leap
forward
seized
the
child
by
the
arm
and
both
went
rolling
down
the
steep
side
of
the
embankment
he
made
the
leap
when
the
engine
was
only
about
six
feet
from
the
child
and
he
must
have
made
his
calculations
very
accurately
for
he
only
let
one
foot
strike
the
ground
between
the
rails
while
the
other
struck
the
ground
outside
of
the
rails
the
slightest
miscalculation
or
the
least
mistake
would
have
been
fatal
to
him
as
well
as
her
for
whom
he
made
the
gallant
leap
at
the
base
of
the
embankment
there
was
a
pond
of
muddy
water
bordered
with
briars
and
broken
rocks
harry
and
the
little
girl
landed
in
the
middle
of
the
pond
bruised
and
bleeding
from
many
wounds
the
engine
came
to
a
halt
as
soon
as
it
struck
the
bridge
and
the
engineer
leaped
down
to
where
harry
lay
in
the
water
and
lifted
him
up
in
his
arms
it
was
an
affecting
sight
to
see
the
man
of
iron
nerve
weeping
like
a
child
my
brave
little
hero
he
exclaimed
as
he
pressed
harry
s
brow
to
his
lips
are
you
hurt
not
much
sir
i
believe
though
my
leg
is
broken
said
harry
poor
fellow
he
fainted
in
the
arms
of
the
strong
man
who
carried
him
up
the
embankment
and
placed
him
on
the
train
the
little
girl
had
a
severe
contusion
on
her
temple
caused
by
falling
against
a
rock
at
the
base
of
the
embankment
she
was
also
placed
on
the
train
and
then
it
was
put
in
motion
and
soon
was
at
the
station
and
a
surgeon
sent
for
while
the
wounded
children
were
removed
to
a
hotel
near
the
depot
the
mother
of
the
little
girl
a
delicate
little
woman
of
great
beauty
swooned
and
fell
to
the
ground
when
she
saw
the
bleeding
child
in
my
arms
the
father
of
the
child
took
her
from
me
in
heaven
s
name
pray
tell
me
what
has
happened
said
he
as
he
took
his
daughter
from
me
she
is
not
seriously
hurt
sir
said
i
and
then
i
told
him
what
had
occurred
harry
had
regained
consciousness
before
we
reached
the
station
and
when
he
saw
how
lottie
was
weeping
as
she
held
his
head
in
her
lap
he
smiled
pleasantly
don
t
be
alarmed
lottie
dear
i
am
not
seriously
hurt
just
one
leg
broken
that
s
all
wasn
t
it
lucky
that
i
happened
to
be
on
the
front
of
that
engine
is
the
little
girl
much
hurt
no
i
think
not
said
the
conductor
she
got
a
slight
cut
on
the
wasn
t
she
a
pretty
little
darling
continued
harry
i
fell
in
love
with
her
as
we
rolled
down
the
embankment
together
and
when
i
get
to
be
a
man
if
she
is
willing
we
ll
go
down
the
path
of
life
his
mind
is
wandering
whispered
the
conductor
harry
overheard
him
perhaps
it
is
said
he
but
let
it
wander
as
much
as
it
likes
so
long
as
it
happens
to
stray
in
that
direction
hush
crying
lottie
dear
i
tell
you
i
am
not
much
hurt
i
shall
be
well
again
in
three
the
old
surgeon
arrived
threw
off
his
coat
rolled
up
his
sleeves
and
went
to
work
like
a
man
who
knew
what
he
was
about
and
i
was
struck
with
admiration
for
the
man
when
i
saw
the
skill
with
which
he
reset
the
broken
bones
and
placed
the
splints
there
now
we
re
all
right
my
brave
little
hero
he
said
smiling
as
he
finished
pinning
the
bandage
keep
it
moist
with
cold
water
to
prevent
inflammation
and
in
three
weeks
this
leg
will
be
as
good
as
the
other
one
by
the
by
what

they

been
stopping
at
this
hotel
some
three
or
four
weeks
and
being
called
in
to
see
bramlett
professionally
i
have
had
a
chance
to
become
well
acquainted
with
the
family
therefore
you
see
i
speak
advisedly
when
i
say
that
little
viola

i
hope
said
harry
that
she
is
not
badly
oh
no
she
is
not
hurt
much
at
all
a
slight
contusion
on
the
temple
and
a
few
scratches
from
the
briars
that
s
all
her
father
will
be
in
to
see
you
directly
he
is
overwhelmed
with
gratitude
to

and
little
viola
heaven

her
won
t
talk
about
anything
except
the
pretty
little
brave
boy
who
kept
her
from
being
killed
she
insisted
on
coming
to
see
you
now
but
i
persuaded
her
to
wait
till
your
wounds
were
dressed
so
you
see
that
you
may
expect
soon
to
be
overflowed
with
thanks
and
kisses
from
the
sweetest
little
darling
that
the
world
ever
saw
ah
you
re
a
lucky
lad
anyway
good
morning
i
ll
see
you
again
this
evening
don
t
move
the
wounded
leg
keep
it
perfectly
still
and
talk
as
much
as
you
please
to
the
little
angel
when
she
comes
to
see
then
the
old
surgeon
bustled
out
of
the
room
and
went
to
visit
his
other
patients
it
was
but
a
little
while
after
harry
s
wounds
had
been
dressed
when
viola
came
bounding
into
the
room
threw
her
arms
round
his
neck
kissing
his
lips
at
least
a
dozen
times
in
rapid
succession
then
she
said
with
a
voice
which
i
thought
very
sweet
and
musical
oh
you
don
t
know
how
much
i
thank
you
for
saving
my
life
papa
says
that
i
should
have
been
crushed
to
death
but
for
your
bravery
he
says
you
are
a
real
hero
and
he
is
going
to
divide
all
his
money
with
you
my
papa
has
great
heaps
of
money
and
he
is
going
to
give
you
half
of
it
and
i
am
to
have
the
other
half
now
won
t
that
be
nice
i
watched
her
movements
with
intense
interest
and
concluded
that
the
old
surgeon
s
description
of
her
charms
had
not
been
exaggerated
harry
gazed
at
her
with
such
a
look
of
admiration
that
i
was
convinced
that
he
concurred
in
the
opinion
expressed
by
the
surgeon
in
regard
to
her
exceeding
great
beauty
bramlett
then
made
his
appearance
and
was
very
enthusiastic
and
profuse
in
his
thanks
to
harry
for
saving
his
little
darling
as
he
called
viola
she
is
all
we
have
sir
and
if
she
had
been
taken
from
us
it
would
have
been
a
fatal
blow
to
our
happiness
words
can
not
express
the
gratitude
we
feel
toward
you
and
as
soon
as
you
get
well
we
shall
talk
more
about
it
i
am
a
man
of
business
and
not
a
man
of
many
words
therefore
you
shall
hear
from
me
again
when
you
get
well
then
bending
down
he
gathered
viola
to
his
heart
and
as
he
kissed
her
fervently
said
go
now
my
darling
and
get
some
choice
flowers
for
the
little
brave
hero
who
risked
his
life
to
save
you
you
must
be
his
nurse
you
know
and
must
keep
him
well
supplied
with
flowers
and
iced
lemonade
etc
and
before
the
sentence
was
finished
viola
had
skipped
off
to
collect
the
flowers
very
soon
she
came
in
with
her
apron
full
of
roses
pinks
and
geraniums
and
deposited
them
in
great
heaps
on
harry
s
bed
filling
the
chamber
with
their
sweet
odor
now
harry
she
said
there
s
your
nice
flowers
and
while
you
are
enjoying
their
fragrance
i
must
go
and
fetch
you
some
lemonade
and
ice
papa
is
making
the
lemonade
for
you
and
he
told
me
to
give
you
the
flowers
and
then
to
come
for
the
she
was
gone
but
a
moment
when
she
returned
with
a
little
tray
on
which
sat
three
goblets
full
of
lemonade
and
ice
giving
the
first
goblet
to
harry
she
then
gave
the
other
two
to
lottie
and
me
when
she
went
out
harry
said
eddie
isn
t
she
the
sweetest
little
thing
you
ever
saw
yes
with
one
exception
undoubtedly
i
replied
casting
a
side
glance
at
lottie
she
understood
my
meaning
and
blushed
crimson
as
she
turned
her
face
away
of
course
you
think
lottie
is
the
prettiest
and
i
sha
n
t
quarrel
with
you
about
i
was
delighted
to
see
harry
so
cheerful
under
his
sufferings
because
it
was
plain
that
his
wound
was
paining
him
his
leg
was
broken
about
three
inches
above
the
ankle
joint
but
thanks
to
the
skillful
old
surgeon
no
lameness
or
deformity
resulted
from
it
and
in
less
than
four
weeks
he
was
able
to
walk
without
crutches
the
railroad
men
from
far
and
near
came
to
see
harry
and
they
almost
worshiped
him
the
old
engineer
came
every
day
to
inquire
how
he
was
getting
on
calling
harry
his
brave
little
hero
bramlett
was
unremitting
in
her
attention
to
harry
overwhelming
him
with
grateful
thanks
she
said
that
her
husband
had
concluded
to
go
with
us
to
memphis
and
never
to
part
from
us
until
he
saw
us
safely
landed
with
harry
s
uncle
the
days
of
harry
s
convalescence
were
days
of
unalloyed
happiness
to
me
for
i
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
saunter
among
the
flowers
with
lottie
while
harry
was
with
viola
all
the
the
queen
requested
ingomar
to
suspend
a
while
then
the
party
began
to
promenade
the
deck
chapter
viii
scottie
was
leaning
on
the
arm
of
ivanhoe
as
they
promenaded
the
deck
conversing
in
subdued
tones
have
you
noticed
that
lady
with
black
silk
domino
and
yellow
mask
no
what
about
her
that
s
she
leaning
on
the
arm
of
the
old
gentleman
with
long
white
whiskers
i
suppose
he
is
her
father
her
movements
have
a
mystery
about
them
that
excited
my
curiosity
she
has
been
listening
to
ingomar
attentively
all
the
time
yet
she
never
speaks
a
word
to
any
one
except
the
old
gentleman
nor
does
she
mingle
with
our
party
yet
she
follows
ingomar
wherever
he
goes
as
though
she
was
a
spy
on
his
indeed
that
is
strange
and
to
add
to
the
mystery
i
see
that
those
two
seedy
men
have
kept
close
to
ingomar
all
the
time
and
appear
to
be
in
earnest
conversation
which
is
always
carried
on
in
whispers
i
think
something
unusual
will
develop
itself
so
do
i
but
i
hope
it
will
be
nothing
against
ingomar
i
believe
he
is
a
perfect
i
hope
you
may
be
right
there
but
it
won
t
do
to
judge
by
look
look
see
that
woman
in
the
black
domino
she
is
pointing
at
ingomar
now
and
whispering
to
the
old
gentleman
i
heard
her
say
in
a
whisper
to
the
same
person
last
night
that
the
suspense
was
killing
her
now
what
could
that
mean
you
are
too
much
for
me
there
but
we
must
wait
patiently
for
further
developments
meantime
let
us
get
our
party
together
and
hear
more
of
ingomar
s
yes
yes
i
am
anxious
to
hear
more
go
see
the
queen
and
ask
her
to
order
the
tale
about
five
weeks
after
harry
had
been
hurt
bramlett
came
into
his
room
and
after
talking
for
a
few
minutes
on
general
topics
he
handed
him
a
roll
of
bank
bills
containing
one
thousand
dollars
take
this
my
brave
little
hero
said
he
as
a
present
from
viola
and
if
ever
the
time
comes
when
you
should
need
a
friend
just
write
to
me
and
i
promise
you
that
i
will
you
are
very
very
kind
sir
said
harry
as
he
bit
his
lips
and
it
was
plain
to
be
seen
that
he
was
deeply
offended
on
handing
the
money
back
i
hope
you
won
t
think
me
rude
sir
but
i
can
t
take
your
i
was
greatly
vexed
at
harry
s
conduct
here
was
money
enough
to
answer
all
our
demands
it
seemed
to
me
that
no
one
but
a
crazy
person
would
refuse
such
a
sum
why
my
little
friend
said
bramlett
you
must
allow
me
to
show
my
gratitude
in
some
way
and
how
could
i
do
it
any
better
than
by
helping
you
with
ready
money
you
must
think
of
your
little
sister
she
must
be
taken
care
of
and
how
can
you
do
it
unless
you
have
money
to
pay
her
board
and
buy
her
clothes
i
can
work
for
her
sir
and
so
can
eddie
we
shall
both
work
for
her
i
should
feel
like
a
beggar
sir
if
i
were
to
take
your
all
a
mistake
i
assure
you
i
have
an
ample
fortune
you
saved
the
life
of
my
darling
viola
and
you
must
allow
me
to
do
something
to
show
my
i
was
not
thinking
of
money
sir
when
i
saved
your
daughter
i
was
thinking
of
no
doubt
no
doubt
you
were
but
you
have
suffered
much
on
account
of
the
gallant
deed
and
i
shall
be
deeply
mortified
if
you
refuse
to
allow
me
a
chance
to
show
how
much
i
feel
the
i
am
very
sorry
sir
to
hear
you
say
that
but
really
i
can
not
take
any
suppose
then
we
make
a
trade
let
me
loan
you
three
thousand
dollars
at
five
per
cent
interest
taking
your
note
with
edward
as
security
on
condition
that
you
use
the
money
in
completing
the
education
of
yourself
your
sister
and
edward
then
you
study
law
and
when
you
begin
to
make
money
at
your
profession
you
shall
pay
my
money
back
with
interest
what
say
you
to
that
that
would
be
worse
it
would
be
receiving
the
money
under
false
pretenses
i
can
readily
understand
the
kindness
that
prompts
you
to
make
the
offer
but
as
i
never
should
be
able
to
pay
your
money
back
it
would
not
be
right
for
me
to
take
mr
bramlett
left
the
room
rather
abruptly
he
was
vexed
at
harry
s
obstinacy
and
when
he
went
into
his
wife
s
room
he
said
that
foolish
boy
refuses
to
accept
any
aid
from
me
i
declare
it
is
too
bad
it
is
a
shame
to
see
them
start
out
afoot
again
he
is
the
most
chap
i
ever
saw
i
ll
resort
to
strategy
i
ll
employ
some
agent
to
look
after
those
allow
me
to
make
a
suggestion
said
bramlett
to
her
husband
as
we
are
going
to
memphis
anyway
you
might
procure
a
situation
for
the
boys
with
some
of
your
business
friends
in
memphis
and
then
you
could
place
money
with
your
agent
and
have
it
paid
to
them
in
such
sums
as
they
need
making
them
believe
all
the
while
that
they
are
earning
it
that
would
keep
them
from
feeling
that
they
are
objects
of
charity
for
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
rather
admire
their
notions
as
you
call
them
of
course
they
are
too
young
to
be
of
much
service
to
anybody
but
it
would
encourage
them
if
they
could
be
made
to
think
that
they
were
earning
their
thank
you
dear
for
the
suggestion
it
is
the
very
thing
we
will
go
to
memphis
and
the
matter
shall
be
of
course
we
were
ignorant
of
this
arrangement
and
did
not
find
it
out
for
many
years
afterward
i
was
at
that
time
unable
to
support
harry
s
independent
views
and
tried
to
argue
the
question
with
him
but
it
was
a
failure
on
my
part
i
should
despise
myself
said
he
if
i
were
to
take
the
kind
gentleman
s
money
knowing
that
i
never
should
be
able
to
pay
it
back
then
perhaps
it
would
displease
our
uncle
if
he
knew
we
had
accepted
money
in
the
way
of
he
went
so
far
as
to
refuse
to
take
the
train
with
bramlett
until
that
gentleman
promised
to
furnish
him
employment
as
soon
as
we
should
reach
memphis
by
which
we
could
him
for
the
money
advanced
to
pay
our
fare
and
i
don
t
believe
he
would
have
done
that
but
for
the
influence
brought
to
bear
on
him
by
viola
who
threw
her
arms
about
his
neck
and
declared
that
she
would
cry
her
eyes
out
unless
he
went
with
her
to
memphis
when
we
arrived
at
memphis
bramlett
took
us
to
the
worsham
house
promising
to
inquire
for
our
uncle
on
the
next
day
and
when
he
came
back
after
having
gone
out
for
that
purpose
and
informed
us
that
our
uncle
had
gone
to
california
with
a
view
of
making
it
his
permanent
home
we
began
to
realize
the
fact
that
we
were
now
left
all
alone
and
must
think
and
act
for
ourselves
what
are
we
to
do
now
harry
i
inquired
we
must
seek
employment
at
once
said
he
and
we
must
lose
no
time
about
it
either
you
stay
with
lottie
and
i
ll
go
out
and
see
what
we
can
get
to
harry
returned
after
three
hours
absence
and
the
look
of
disappointment
that
appeared
on
his
face
convinced
me
of
his
failure
before
he
told
it
no
one
seems
to
want
us
he
said
gloomily
as
he
dropped
exhausted
on
a
chair
i
have
met
nothing
but
disappointment
at
every
point
but
i
will
try
again
when
i
get
lottie
wiped
the
perspiration
from
his
brow
with
her
handkerchief
and
ran
her
fingers
through
his
hair
you
must
get
some
work
for
me
to
do
too
harry
you
know
how
nicely
i
can
sew
and
how
neatly
i
can
cut
and
fit
a
lady
s
dress
i
shall
make
a
great
deal
of
money
if
you
ll
only
get
the
work
for
me
to
i
know
you
would
lottie
but
no
one
will
give
us
work
i
fear
because
we
are
strangers
here
and
people
don
t
like
to
trust
strangers
you
papa
has
gone
out
to
hunt
work
for
you
to
do
harry
said
viola
as
she
pushed
lottie
gently
away
from
her
brother
you
go
and
stay
with
eddie
there
miss
lottie
and
leave
me
to
look
after
harry
i
shall
be
jealous
you
know
if
you
pay
so
much
attention
to
my
hero
speaking
of
work
i
heard
papa
say
to
mamma
that
he
would
find
a
good
place
for
you
to
live
at
before
he
left
the
city
then
we
are
going
to
new
orleans
and
then
we
are
going
to
havana
and
then
we
are
going
to
come
back
here
to
see
you
and
then
won
t
we
have
lots
of
fun
and
stooping
down
with
her
mouth
to
harry
s
ear
she
said
i
ve
got
something
nice
for
you
but
you
must
come
with
me
to
my
room
before
i
show
it
to
you
because
eddie
and
lottie
are
not
to
see
it
at
all
so
come
along
of
course
harry
went
and
he
was
not
prepared
for
the
surprise
which
she
gave
him
for
she
held
up
a
large
golden
locket
swinging
to
a
heavy
gold
chain
there
it
is
isn
t
it
pretty
papa
gave
dollars
for
it
and
you
must
accept
it
as
a
present
from
me
you
see
it
has
got
my
picture
in
it
i
thought
maybe
you
would
like
my
picture
to
look
at
when
i
am
gone
for
i
m
sure
i
should
like
very
much
to
have
yours
to
look
at
when
i
am
so
far
away
from
i
shall
wear
this
pretty
picture
next
to
my
heart
as
long
as
i
live
and
i
shall
always
love
the
darling
who
gave
it
to
you
must
get
your
picture
made
and
give
it
to
me
before
i
go
away
won
t
you
harry
did
not
know
what
answer
to
make
for
he
knew
that
it
required
money
to
have
a
picture
made
and
money
was
not
his
maybe
so
he
said
sadly
o
don
t
say
that
you
must
not
by
any
means
refuse
me
your
you
shall
have
it
as
soon
as
i
can
earn
the
money
to
pay
for
never
mind
the
money
i
ll
get
that
from
papa
he
always
gives
me
money
when
i
ask
i
should
rather
pay
for
it
with
my
own
money
then
it
would
be
a
present
from
i
persuaded
harry
to
remain
at
the
hotel
until
i
should
make
a
tour
through
the
city
to
try
my
luck
in
seeking
employment
i
went
from
house
to
house
from
one
end
of
main
street
to
the
other
asking
at
all
places
for
work
and
then
i
went
on
front
row
and
tried
every
business
house
for
employment
willing
to
do
anything
to
make
an
honest
living
i
offered
to
drive
a
dray
or
to
roll
barrels
or
any
sort
of
work
that
anybody
might
want
done
but
no
one
seemed
to
care
to
employ
me
i
suppose
it
was
my
green
and
seedy
appearance
that
went
against
me
and
i
was
returning
to
the
hotel
completely
overcome
with
fatigue
and
disappointment
when
i
heard
a
familiar
voice
call
my
name
ah
ha
here
we
are
again
eddie
old
fellow
you
are
the
very
chap
i
was
looking
for
ah
ha
eddie
what
good
luck
i
was
seized
by
both
hands
and
looking
up
saw
the
kind
eyes
of
old
doctor
dodson
bent
on
me
no
one
will
ever
know
how
my
sad
heart
leaped
for
joy
when
i
heard
his
kind
words
yes
yes
ah
ha
you
were
the
very
lad
i
wished
to
see
i
have
just
come
to
memphis
with
a
view
of
making
it
my
home
i
have
bought
a
and
mean
to
practice
my
profession
here
and
sell
drugs
also
and
i
mean
to
put
you
in
the
store
as
my
clerk
etc
ah
ha
eddie
yes
yes
you
see
it
all
now
don
t
you
i
was
so
overjoyed
with
the
news
that
i
was
unable
to
answer
then
but
as
soon
as
i
could
collect
my
ideas
i
thanked
him
and
promised
to
accept
his
kind
offer
it
was
agreed
that
i
should
commence
business
with
the
doctor
on
the
next
morning
ah
ha
eddie
all
settled
you
see
that
s
business
i
mean
to
make
a
great
doctor
out
of
you
one
of
these
days
you
ve
got
a
splendid
head
for
a
doctor
ah
ha
that
you
have
my
boy
there
now
you
may
go
until
and
then
to
business
you
i
hastened
to
the
hotel
to
impart
the
good
news
to
harry
and
lottie
and
i
must
say
that
i
had
risen
at
least
one
hundred
per
cent
in
my
own
estimation
wouldn
t
i
now
be
able
to
support
lottie
and
harry
too
i
imagined
that
i
should
be
able
to
support
them
with
all
ease
but
that
of
course
was
one
of
the
childish
dreams
which
often
found
lodgment
in
my
simple
brain
when
i
returned
to
the
hotel
and
imparted
the
good
news
to
harry
and
lottie
it
made
me
very
happy
to
see
how
much
pleasure
it
gave
them
meantime
bramlett
had
been
arranging
his
plans
or
rather
executing
the
plans
he
had
determined
on
previously
he
was
seated
in
the
office
of
rockland
an
eminent
lawyer
who
had
for
many
years
been
his
agent
and
adviser
mr
rockland
said
bramlett
this
is
a
delicate
matter
and
i
trust
you
with
its
management
and
i
may
as
well
tell
you
now
that
it
will
require
some
strategy
and
much
skill
to
make
the
plan
work
smoothly
i
have
never
met
with
three
such
children
they
are
as
proud
as
lucifer
and
as
independent
as
if
they
had
the
wealth
of
the
rothchilds
and
if
they
ever
should
suspect
that
the
money
comes
from
me
the
whole
business
goes
overboard
i
see
said
the
lawyer
i
think
i
shall
be
able
to
manage
the
business
so
as
to
accomplish
what
you
wish
if
i
understand
you
correctly
bramlett
you
want
those
children
properly
educated
and
then
you
want
the
boys
to
be
put
to
the
law
as
soon
as
their
education
shall
have
been
just
so
rockland
you
understand
me
correctly
i
feel
under
great
obligations
to
young
wallingford
and
have
offered
to
show
it
by
aiding
him
but
he
rejects
my
offer
merely
through
pride
therefore
i
mean
to
help
him
in
this
secret
manner
i
beg
you
not
to
stand
back
on
account
of
money
draw
on
me
for
all
that
may
be
necessary
and
the
cash
will
the
description
you
have
given
of
those
children
convinces
me
that
my
task
will
be
rather
an
agreeable
one
because
pride
and
independence
are
by
no
means
evil
qualities
unless
possessed
by
ignorant
people
and
they
are
far
from
being
ignorant
judging
from
what
you
have
told
me
rockland
will
be
glad
to
receive
them
as
we
have
no
children
of
our
own
consequently
she
leads
rather
a
lonely
existence
so
you
may
consider
the
matter
here
is
a
card
for
harry
wallingford
said
a
as
he
dipped
his
head
in
the
door
harry
read
as
follows
harry
wallingford
sir
please
call
at
my
office
immediately
i
wish
to
see
you
on
important
business
respectfully
harry
went
to
the
office
without
delay
while
his
mind
was
crowded
with
conjectures
as
to
what
kind
of
business
was
to
be
discussed
he
found
rockland
seated
near
a
table
covered
with
a
huge
mass
of
papers
busily
engaged
looking
over
them
and
when
harry
entered
the
office
the
old
lawyer
fixed
his
eyes
on
him
for
a
moment
as
if
measuring
his
worth
take
a
seat
little
man
i
suppose
you
are
harry
wallingford
yes
mr
bramlett
was
speaking
to
me
about
you
and
by
the
by
he
has
given
you
a
very
favorable
recommendation
and
i
have
concluded
to
offer
you
employment
if
we
can
agree
on
terms
i
want
a
boy
to
help
me
in
my
office
and
you
shall
have
the
place
if
you
think
it
will
suit
i
shall
be
glad
sir
to
get
the
place
and
shall
try
to
please
very
good
i
shall
not
be
able
to
offer
you
very
large
i
could
not
expect
it
then
to
come
to
the
point
i
propose
to
board
and
clothe
you
and
your
sister
for
the
work
you
and
she
can
do
she
can
be
a
sort
of
companion
to
rockland
you
see
we
have
no
children
therefore
your
sister
will
no
doubt
be
able
to
help
rockland
in
many
ways
meantime
she
can
go
to
school
so
can
you
but
then
you
will
have
to
work
very
hard
because
i
shall
require
you
to
work
mornings
and
evenings
and
sometimes
late
at
night
this
you
know
must
be
understood
before
we
close
the
contract
if
i
board
clothe
and
educate
you
and
your
sister
you
see
it
will
require
all
the
money
that
you
and
she
could
i
am
afraid
sir
we
shall
not
be
able
to
earn
enough
to
pay
for
all
i
ll
risk
that
but
you
ll
find
i
shall
keep
you
very
busy
and
then
i
must
find
a
situation
for
your
he
has
found
a
situation
with
doctor
dodson
oh
has
he
that
s
lucky
then
we
are
all
right
is
it
a
bargain
between
us
yes
sir
and
i
am
very
thankful
when
do
you
wish
me
to
commence
stay
with
bramlett
until
he
starts
to
new
orleans
then
bring
your
sister
to
my
house
and
we
shall
go
to
when
harry
came
back
his
handsome
face
was
beaming
with
pleasure
and
while
relating
what
had
occurred
he
did
not
fail
to
congratulate
lottie
on
the
chances
which
she
would
have
of
securing
an
accomplished
education
fortune
seemed
to
have
made
up
her
mind
on
this
occasion
to
shower
her
brightest
smiles
on
us
all
at
once
had
she
not
provided
us
with
good
homes
kind
friends
and
all
we
could
expect
or
wish
for
and
right
here
i
feel
it
to
be
my
duty
to
express
my
thanks
to
old
robert
for
it
was
all
brought
about
by
him
what
a
slice
of
good
luck
it
was
that
caused
him
to
take
a
fancy
to
lottie
on
that
eventful
night
when
he
came
to
our
camp
and
began
to
lick
her
hand
i
suppose
madame
fortune
had
prompted
him
to
do
it
we
never
knew
who
was
old
bob
s
master
before
he
concluded
to
cast
his
lot
with
us
but
from
his
lean
and
hungry
look
we
inferred
that
he
had
been
serving
a
cruel
master
and
that
he
was
out
on
a
foraging
expedition
when
he
happened
to
come
upon
our
camp
the
night
was
dark
and
i
suppose
he
came
near
enough
to
see
lottie
s
sweet
face
as
she
sat
gazing
into
the
fire
and
here
is
the
substance
of
what
i
imagine
passed
through
old
bob
s
mind
as
he
peered
into
lottie
s
face
with
his
one
eye
i
am
very
hungry
the
fact
is
i
am
about
to
perish
for
food
my
master
is
unkind
and
cruel
instead
of
giving
me
food
he
gives
me
nothing
but
blows
and
curses
and
i
believe
i
shall
run
away
from
him
and
seek
me
another
master
that
little
girl
has
a
beautiful
countenance
and
i
expect
she
has
a
kind
heart
and
i
think
she
would
have
compassion
on
a
poor
old
hungry
dog
like
me
i
believe
i
ll
venture
up
to
her
and
lick
her
hand
and
maybe
she
will
give
me
a
bone
to
gnaw
on
oh
how
i
wish
i
had
a
beautiful
tail
to
wag
in
order
to
make
her
pity
me
i
am
afraid
my
ugliness
will
frighten
her
and
if
it
does
i
shall
be
driven
off
and
then
shall
get
no
bone
but
my
poor
stomach
is
so
empty
and
my
mouth
waters
so
that
i
shall
venture
up
at
all
hazards
if
she
drives
me
away
it
can
t
make
matters
worse
and
if
she
is
kind
and
gives
me
a
bone
i
ll
follow
her
for
her
sweet
face
leads
me
to
think
she
ll
do
to
tie
immediately
after
having
the
unuttered
conversation
with
himself
old
bob
ventured
up
and
licked
lottie
s
hand
the
result
was
he
got
a
medium
supper
and
found
that
the
favorable
opinion
he
had
formed
as
to
the
kindness
of
her
heart
was
by
no
means
too
extravagant
we
know
what
followed
at
least
we
know
that
bob
followed
lottie
and
we
further
know
that
his
fondness
for
rabbits
led
us
to
the
gravel
pit
which
led
us
to
the
gravel
train
which
carried
harry
to
the
embankment
where
he
saved
the
life
of
viola
whose
father
caused
rockland
to
give
us
good
homes
and
this
proves
that
it
is
better
to
give
a
poor
dog
kindness
than
kicks
now
who
knows
what
might
have
happened
to
us
if
old
bob
had
not
trusted
to
lottie
s
kind
face
that
night
or
if
she
had
taken
a
stick
and
beaten
him
i
dare
say
we
should
have
been
wandering
about
the
streets
of
memphis
friendless
houseless
and
penniless
working
for
our
daily
bread
and
sleeping
in
some
filthy
sickly
den
while
dear
lottie
would
have
been
dressed
in
rags
but
now
through
her
kindness
to
poor
old
tailless
bob
she
has
got
a
splendid
home
good
friends
fine
clothes
and
bright
prospects
unfolding
themselves
for
the
future
who
will
venture
to
deny
that
old
bob
was
possessed
of
good
judgment
who
will
say
that
he
did
not
make
a
good
selection
when
he
concluded
to
take
lottie
for
his
mistress
and
protector
well
here
we
are
ah
ha
eddie
said
doctor
dodson
next
morning
when
he
met
me
at
the
door
of
his
new
i
suppose
you
are
ready
for
business
ah
ha
yes
good
my
boy
good
then
he
began
to
instruct
me
as
to
the
duties
i
was
to
perform
and
teaching
me
the
names
of
the
various
kinds
of
drugs
i
went
to
work
with
the
determination
to
succeed
and
to
please
my
employer
it
was
but
a
few
months
before
i
knew
the
names
of
all
the
drugs
and
could
make
up
the
prescriptions
with
skill
and
safety
i
was
very
proud
to
find
that
the
doctor
was
pleased
with
me
the
doctor
s
wife
was
as
kind
to
me
as
if
she
had
been
my
own
mother
and
all
things
considered
i
had
a
happy
home
and
was
contented
harry
and
lottie
were
delighted
with
their
new
situations
but
i
did
not
see
them
as
often
as
i
wished
though
i
went
with
lottie
to
church
occasionally
and
sat
in
the
same
pew
with
her
and
read
my
prayers
in
her
book
and
then
mixed
drugs
and
built
air
castles
the
remainder
of
the
week
but
i
am
getting
tired
of
talking
about
children
and
i
expect
my
hearers
are
tired
of
it
too
and
i
shall
therefore
say
but
little
more
about
it
if
i
have
bored
you
with
too
much
talk
of
dogs
and
children
i
beg
pardon
and
promise
to
make
a
long
leap
over
the
space
of
seven
years
they
were
years
of
happiness
to
me
so
were
they
to
lottie
and
harry
lottie
is
eighteen
and
more
beautiful
than
ever
the
large
dreamy
eyes
are
the
same
but
the
tall
queenly
form
has
filled
out
presenting
a
model
that
an
artist
would
delight
to
paint
from
the
stamp
of
intellect
was
sparkling
on
her
white
brow
and
she
was
as
i
thought
then
and
think
now
the
most
charming
girl
that
my
eyes
had
ever
looked
upon
harry
had
made
rapid
progress
in
his
legal
studies
and
would
be
ready
to
enter
on
his
professional
career
by
the
time
he
was
while
i
was
an
overgrown
awkward
young
man
rather
shy
and
sneaky
when
in
the
presence
of
strangers
though
i
had
studied
closely
and
doctor
dodson
said
i
would
some
day
be
a
great
physician
it
was
arranged
that
i
should
attend
the
lectures
in
philadelphia
and
i
thought
it
best
to
have
an
understanding
with
lottie
before
i
left
i
had
never
asked
her
to
be
my
wife
i
became
jealous
and
unhappy
because
lottie
was
surrounded
by
devoted
admirers
many
of
whom
were
men
of
wealth
and
high
social
standing
and
i
was
alarmed
lest
i
should
after
all
lose
the
great
prize
but
let
us
rest
a
while
and
i
ll
tell
more
about
it
in
the
next
chapter
ix
lottie
had
been
at
the
bards
town
school
in
kentucky
for
four
years
but
she
usually
spent
the
summer
vacation
at
home
she
graduated
with
the
highest
honors
having
won
the
first
prize
in
greek
latin
and
french
and
triumphantly
carried
off
the
costly
gold
cup
offered
for
the
best
original
poem
there
were
two
things
combined
which
contributed
to
her
success
in
the
first
place
she
possessed
the
active
brain
and
the
ambition
and
in
the
second
place
she
had
been
trained
and
taught
much
of
the
time
by
rockland
before
she
went
to
the
kentucky
school
the
iron
lawyer
would
often
take
her
into
his
library
and
make
her
recite
lesson
after
lesson
when
he
would
lecture
her
on
the
different
branches
of
her
studies
then
he
would
stray
away
into
ancient
and
modern
history
poetry
and
politics
spending
hours
in
expounding
them
to
the
mind
that
was
so
able
and
willing
to
grasp
the
meaning
he
would
often
make
lottie
draw
up
bills
in
chancery
write
pleas
and
declarations
under
his
direction
then
he
would
explain
all
the
legal
points
in
some
important
case
and
request
her
to
look
up
the
law
and
arrange
his
brief
it
was
a
remarkable
fact
that
rockland
would
neglect
his
best
paying
clients
in
order
to
cram
his
solid
ideas
into
lottie
s
grasping
mind
ed
she
will
be
home
said
harry
wallingford
as
he
ran
his
hand
under
my
arm
and
walked
down
the
street
by
my
side
i
have
just
received
a
telegram
from
her
she
left
bards
town
this
morning
and
is
now
in
louisville
rockland
is
going
to
give
a
grand
ball
in
honor
of
her
great
triumph
as
the
champion
at
bards
town
i
suppose
you
have
heard
about
her
wonderful
victory
see
here
old
fellow
is
that
all
you
have
to
say
in
praise
of
this
wonderful
sister
of
mine
what
is
the
matter
with
you
anyway
you
look
as
if
you
wanted
to
murder
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
me
at
all
and
i
am
glad
to
hear
of
lottie
s
grand
achievements
i
replied
rather
dryly
because
i
had
begun
to
discuss
with
my
mind
on
the
probabilities
of
losing
lottie
i
knew
full
well
that
many
a
gallant
knight
would
be
ready
to
leap
into
the
arena
as
a
contestant
for
the
charming
prize
ready
to
battle
to
the
death
to
win
the
hand
and
heart
of
the
most
lovely
the
most
beautiful
and
the
most
talented
girl
in
tennessee
when
i
weighed
my
chances
well
i
was
forced
to
the
conclusion
that
they
were
too
light
to
go
into
the
balances
against
many
other
young
men
who
i
knew
were
going
to
enter
the
lists
lottie
had
always
manifested
a
partiality
for
me
but
i
was
afraid
that
it
was
more
a
feeling
of
sisterly
love
than
anything
else
during
our
childhood
days
we
had
often
talked
of
the
feelings
of
true
love
which
we
had
for
each
other
but
lottie
was
now
a
woman
and
i
did
not
want
her
to
love
me
as
a
brother
i
had
no
money
and
but
little
education
was
green
and
awkward
timid
and
ugly
and
had
no
confidence
in
myself
but
i
was
determined
to
break
many
a
lance
before
a
rival
should
carry
off
the
great
prize
mr
rockland
was
so
deeply
in
love
with
lottie
that
it
amounted
to
idolatry
and
it
was
generally
believed
and
publicly
expressed
that
he
would
settle
his
large
fortune
on
her
he
was
extravagant
in
the
expenditure
of
money
for
her
comfort
in
fact
he
poured
it
out
like
water
to
gratify
her
slightest
wish
though
she
was
rather
inclined
to
be
economical
and
prudent
she
seemed
to
think
more
of
her
books
and
music
than
she
did
of
dress
and
display
ed
old
boy
exclaimed
wallingford
after
a
long
pause
did
you
know
that
i
was
very
proud
of
my
sister
ah
yes
i
tell
you
what
it
is
she
is
ahead
of
any
girl
in
memphis
so
far
as
intelligence
and
goodness
are
concerned
rockland
says
that
she
is
going
to
set
lottie
out
when
the
ball
comes
how
set
her
out
pshaw
don
t
you
know
what
they
mean
by
setting
a
girl
out
of
course
you
do
when
a
girl
is
ready
to
receive
matrimonial
propositions
they
set
her
out
that
is
they
hang
out
the
sign
as
the
gamblers
say
they
spread
their
don
t
you
see
well
rockland
is
going
to
rig
lottie
up
and
throw
her
at
the
heads
of
the
male
community
as
it
were
now
ed
let
me
tell
you
one
thing
i
mean
to
have
something
to
say
in
that
little
skirmish
and
the
man
who
marries
my
sister
must
be
the
reliable
sort
if
any
bumpkin
begins
to
caper
around
lottie
i
ll
just
give
him
unlimited
leave
of
absence
and
if

but

heart

right
sort
and
he
must

established
reputation

honor
and
integrity

sister
and

her

inclined

do
such
a
man
some
great
bodily
harm
thank
you
ed
i
believe
you
would
and
well
you
might
because
you
know
lottie
always
loved
you
as
a
i
felt
my
heart
make
a
sudden
leap
and
drive
the
blood
to
my
cheeks
when
he
spoke
of
brotherly
love
i
wanted
none
of
that
sort
i
felt
miserable
and
was
unable
to
conceal
my
feelings
old
boy
said
wallingford
as
he
turned
into
the
street
that
led
to
his
office
you
must
call
and
see
us
when
lottie
gets
i
bowed
stiffly
said
nothing
and
hurried
on
to
my
home
by
no
means
satisfied
with
the
prospects
they
are
going
to
set
her
out
are
they
i
said
mentally
good
i
ll
be
there
when
the
show
begins
and
though
my
chance
is
slim
yet
i
ll
die
hard
if
die
i
i
made
a
draw
on
doctor
dodson
for
cash
to
pay
for
a
ball
dress
and
felt
profoundly
thankful
to
my
tailor
for
the
skill
he
displayed
in
the
i
did
not
call
to
see
lottie
when
she
arrived
because
i
wanted
to
appear
at
the
ball
in
my
splendid
new
costume
so
as
to
take
a
fair
start
in
the
matrimonial
tilt
i
knew
the
other
young
men
would
make
grand
indeed
were
the
preparations
that
were
being
made
for
the
great
ball
and
the
young
people
who
had
been
so
fortunate
as
to
receive
an
invitation
were
looking
forward
impatiently
to
the
eventful
day
and
no
one
thought
about
it
more
anxiously
than
i
did
i
was
very
full
of
apprehension
and
doubt
in
regard
to
lottie
s
feelings
toward
me
and
i
propounded
a
thousand
questions
to
my
own
mind
about
it
will
she
look
down
from
the
high
circle
where
fortune
has
placed
her
to
the
humble
sphere
in
which
i
am
doomed
to
dwell
or
will
she
forget
the
poor
awkward
boy
who
in
the
happy
days
of
old
was
glad
to
kiss
the
dust
that
had
felt
the
touch
of
her
little
feet
why
should
she
stoop
so
low
as
to
even
think
of
me
what
right
have
i
a
poor
clerk
to
expect
such
a
brilliant
beautiful
heiress
to
lavish
her
favors
on
me
when
men
of
wealth
and
high
position
are
ready
to
lay
their
honors
and
wealth
at
her
feet
what
right
have
i
to
aspire
so
high
none
none
none
was
thundered
in
my
ear
by
common
sense
as
the
answer
to
my
mental
questions
miss
charlotte
wallingford
is
not
for
your
sort
said
reason
she
is
fit
for
the
wife
of
a
king
yes
but
i
saved
her
life
said
my
mind
and
she
is
under
obligations
to
true
enough
reason
replies
but
it
does
not
follow
that
she
must
marry
you
women
s
lives
are
often
saved
by
their
servants
yet
they
do
not
marry
but
it
will
kill
me
if
miss
wallingford
marries
any
other
no
matter
if
it
does
why
should
she
care
the
world
will
never
feel
the
loss
the
sun
will
shine
as
bright
the
flowers
grow
as
sweet
and
the
seasons
will
come
and
go
after
you
are
dead
just
as
they
did
when
you
were
with
such
unpleasant
reflections
as
these
i
had
managed
to
work
my
mind
up
to
an
unusual
degree
of
excitement
i
became
gloomy
and
unhappy
to
such
an
extent
as
to
attract
the
attention
of
my
good
mother
as
i
called
dodson
and
she
begged
me
to
tell
her
the
cause
of
my
misery
i
evaded
her
questions
and
sought
solitude
where
i
could
give
vent
to
my
sorrow
unmolested
she
cast
many
an
imploring
look
at
me
when
i
would
leave
my
food
untasted
my
cheeks
grew
pale
and
my
appetite
failed
and
i
hugged
my
misery
to
my
breast
and
told
my
secret
to
none
i
was
proud
and
felt
offended
but
had
no
reasons
to
give
for
it
no
one
had
been
unkind
to
or
in
any
manner
maltreated
me
yet
i
was
querulous
melancholy
and
despairing
ah
ha
here
we
come
my
boy
said
doctor
dodson
one
morning
as
he
came
into
the
store
what

the
matter

the
matter

my
boy
speak

out
let
it
come
what
makes
you
look
like
a
ghost
my
boy
pshaw

t
tell

such
a
tale
as
that
my
boy
ah

t

you
ever

a
russian
bear

boy

try
to
fool

in
your
mind
ah

don
t
you
see
yes

that

matter
something

gone
wrong
i
d
say
it
was
a
love
scrape
if
it
was
any
other
boy
but
my
old
booby
has
too
much
sense
for
anything
of
that
sort
ah
ha
don
t
you
see
how
it
is
my
boy
i
soon
became
convinced
that
the
good
old
doctor
would
pry
the
secret
out
of
me
unless
i
resorted
to
falsehood
which
i
resolved
not
to
do
therefore
i
begged
him
to
let
me
alone
promising
to
tell
him
everything
at
the
end
of
ten
days
ah
ha
very
good
my
boy
i
won
t
press
you
further
just
now
but
i
mean
to
hold
you
down
to
your
promise
don
t
you
see
i
won
t
let
you
go
to
philadelphia
while
you
are
looking
like
a
defunct
specimen
of
humanity
ah
ha
don
t
you
see
you
look
more
like
a
fit
subject
for
a
than
a
medical
school
ah
ha
yes
that
you
do
my
boy
there
now
go
to
work
and
quit
this
moping
about
as
if
you
wanted
to
sneak
into
a
i
was
glad
when
the
doctor
was
called
to
see
one
of
his
patients
at
last
the
time
for
the
grand
ball
arrived
and
i
had
arranged
my
toilet
with
unusual
care
my
good
mother
had
been
persuading
me
to
send
my
card
to
miss
ella
willchester
a
charming
young
lady
residing
just
across
the
street
from
our
house
but
it
would
have
required
the
strength
of
a
forty
engine
to
make
me
escort
any
other
girl
to
lottie
s
ball
i
thought
it
would
be
treason
to
her
if
i
offered
any
favors
to
any
other
girl
the
fact
is
i
could
not
think
of
anybody
else
but
lottie
her
image
was
floating
before
my
eyes
by
day
and
swimming
in
my
mind
when
i
was
asleep
i
did
not
make
my
appearance
at
the
ball
until
after
ten
o
clock
for
i
wanted
to
slip
in
quietly
unobserved
in
order
that
i
might
see
whether
lottie
had
even
so
much
as
thought
about
me
i
must
acknowledge
that
i
felt
rather
sheepish
when
i
was
going
round
so
as
to
come
in
at
the
side
entrance
hoping
to
get
in
unnoticed
the
band
commenced
playing
a
lively
waltz
as
i
stepped
on
the
veranda
at
the
end
of
the
and
a
dozen
couples
went
whirling
round
and
floating
gracefully
through
the
hall
i
took
a
seat
on
a
chair
near
a
window
where
i
could
peep
between
the
folds
of
the
rich
lace
curtains
and
watch
the
movements
of
the
guests
within
i
noticed
a
half
dozen
young
men
crowd
round
a
young
lady
whose
back
was
toward
me
they
were
struggling
with
and
jostling
each
other
all
apparently
eager
to
get
a
word
with
the
young
lady
who
was
the
fair
one
that
attracted
such
attention
was
the
question
that
came
up
in
my
mind
i
could
see
the
tall
form
but
could
not
get
a
view
of
her
face
the
square
shoulders
and
straight
body
the
beautiful
arms
and
bright
golden
hair
were
visible
but
my
mind
was
full
of
curiosity
to
know
who
she
was
i
thought
it
might
be
lottie
but
then
she
was
too
tall
or
at
least
i
concluded
that
after
a
moment
s
reflection
it
was
lottie
nevertheless
and
i
had
lost
sight
of
the
fact
that
it
had
been
nearly
a
year
since
i
had
seen
her
she
abruptly
left
the
crowd
of
admirers
excuse
me
a
moment
please
i
heard
her
say
as
she
went
to
her
brother
who
occupied
a
seat
just
inside
the
room
and
within
six
feet
of
where
i
was
brother
has
eddie
come
yet
i
heard
the
question
distinctly
no
i
don
t
think
he
has
was
the
reply
i
am
afraid
he
is
ill
else
he
would
have
been
here
long
pshaw
sister
never
mind
ed
he
isn
t
the
sort
that
gets
oh
i
am
so
sorry
he
is
not
here
i
could
bear
it
no
longer
my
heart
was
again
in
my
throat
and
i
thrust
my
hand
in
between
the
curtains
and
said
i
did
not
expect
you
would
have
time
to
spare
a
thought
about
me
on
such
an
occasion
as
she
uttered
a
smothered
scream
sprang
through
the
door
and
seized
both
of
my
hands
and
began
to
jerk
them
up
and
down
never
had
my
eyes
beheld
such
a
lovely
object
as
the
one
then
before
me
such
radiant
beauty
such
lofty
dazzling
charms
such
large
liquid
blue
eyes
and
bright
golden
hair
such
round
pretty
arms
such
a
tall
stately
form
nothing
could
match
this
angelic
creature
i
was
stunned
surprised
and
almost
paralyzed
as
i
stood
staring
with
open
mouth
at
the
wonderful
beauty
before
me
is
this
lottie
can
this
be
the
same
little
thing
who
tramped
so
many
miles
by
my
side
long
long
ago
that
was
the
question
that
naturally
forced
itself
on
my
mind
i
could
not
realize
the
fact
that
this
radiant
model
of
perfection
and
the
little
tramp
were
one
and
the
same
person
i
am
going
to
give
you
a
real
good
scolding
eddie
she
said
as
she
still
held
both
of
my
hands
tightly
clasped
in
hers
why
have
you
not
come
to
see
me
before
now
and
what
made
you
come
so
late
and
what
made
you
slip
in
here
and
hide
as
if
you
had
been
doing
a
mean
thing
all
i
could
do
was
to
stand
like
an
idiot
staring
at
the
indescribable
beauty
before
me
unable
to
utter
a
word
i
then
and
there
concluded
that
she
never
would
be
mine
no
such
woman
could
ever
come
down
low
enough
to
be
the
wife
of
a
what
is
the
matter
eddie
she
exclaimed
in
an
anxious
tone
as
she
cast
a
look
of
surprise
at
me
you
are
ill
your
hands
are
very
cold
and
your
face
is
as
pale
as
no
i
am
very
well
i
thank
you
i
managed
with
a
struggle
to
say
you
are
trying
to
deceive
me
but
you
can
not
do
it
you
have
been
ill
partners
for
a
quadrille
exclaimed
the
leader
of
the
band
and
three
young
men
made
a
dash
toward
lottie
each
one
claiming
her
as
a
partner
she
took
the
arm
of
heartsell
after
some
little
controversy
as
to
whose
turn
it
was
to
dance
with
her
and
soon
was
floating
through
the
waltz
with
him
by
jupiter
she
is
a
stunner
ain
t
she
sam
exclaimed
a
dandyfied
youth
as
heartsell
led
her
away
your
head
s
level
and
don
t
you
forget
it
replied
the
one
addressed
who
was
a
little
law
student
with
but
a
small
amount
of
brains
and
lots
of
brass
wherever
i
went
i
could
hear
groups
of
young
men
lavishing
their
extravagant
praises
on
the
wonderful
young
beauty
who
had
so
suddenly
blazed
down
among
them
like
a
newly
discovered
planet
as
soon
as
lottie
was
released
from
heartsell
she
came
back
to
me
eddie
said
she
i
want
you
to
enjoy
yourself
here
and
you
must
let
me
introduce
you
to
some
of
these
charming
young
ladies
i
heard
one
expressing
an
anxiety
to
be
introduced
to
that
tall
handsome
young
gentleman
with
the
shaggy
whiskers
i
think
she
is
smitten
with
both
you
and
your
whiskers
come
let
me
introduce
you
no
you
must
excuse
me
lottie
i
will
not
dance
unless
it
is
with
indeed
you
do
me
great
honor
and
i
ll
put
you
down
for
the
third
set
as
i
am
engaged
for
the
next
two
and
would
have
been
for
every
other
one
but
i
declined
the
honor
you
must
excuse
me
now
i
am
acting
hostess
as
mother
is
not
very
i
waited
for
my
turn
with
no
small
degree
of
impatience
as
i
sat
like
a
picture
against
the
wall
watching
lottie
as
she
glided
like
a
fairy
through
the
mazes
of
the
dance
she
was
dressed
in
white
satin
trimmed
with
lace
of
the
most
exquisite
and
costly
pattern
with
close
and
body
which
set
off
her
round
straight
form
to
great
advantage
a
cluster
of
sparkling
diamonds
fastened
both
ends
of
a
pearl
necklace
which
met
on
her
bosom
while
a
large
white
rose
was
pinned
at
her
throat
with
a
little
golden
arrow
and
a
broad
band
of
gold
encircled
each
wrist
while
a
large
amethyst
set
glittered
from
each
one
of
the
bracelets
her
long
golden
hair
was
coiled
up
in
two
plaited
rolls
and
pinned
on
the
back
of
her
head
with
a
pair
of
set
in
diamonds
i
never
had
seen
lottie
so
exquisitely
dressed
before
although
she
was
always
very
particular
and
neat
in
her
toilet
rockland
had
ordered
her
set
of
diamonds
from
new
york
especially
for
that
occasion
at
last
the
time
arrived
when
i
was
to
waltz
with
her
and
i
would
have
been
glad
to
offer
an
excuse
because
i
was
trembling
like
one
in
an
ague
fit
and
felt
as
if
i
were
going
to
make
a
botch
of
it
i
knew
i
was
clumsy
awkward
and
a
novice
at
the
business
and
just
as
i
was
about
to
stammer
out
an
excuse
the
band
struck
up
a
lively
waltz
and
lottie
seized
me
without
ceremony
and
almost
dragged
me
to
the
middle
of
the
floor
i
imagined
that
the
eyes
of
every
one
in
the
room
were
gazing
at
me
and
i
was
about
half
right
for
my
tall
gawky
form
loomed
up
above
all
the
other
men
which
attracted
the
attention
of
the
spectators
when
we
began
to
whirl
round
the
room
lottie
let
her
cheek
rest
on
my
shoulder
and
i
felt
her
cool
sweet
breath
fanning
my
face
while
her
beautiful
eyes
gazed
up
into
mine
with
an
expression
of
unmixed
delight
i
had
not
failed
to
notice
how
differently
she
acted
when
waltzing
with
me
from
what
she
did
with
other
men
her
fair
cheek
had
never
touched
another
man
s
shoulder
on
that
night
and
no
one
had
been
able
to
keep
her
on
the
floor
as
long
as
i
did
i
soon
became
warmed
up
and
my
blood
boiled
with
the
intoxicating
influence
of
the
music
and
the
love
for
the
girl
whose
cheek
rested
on
my
shoulder
i
forgot
everything
but
the
dear
idol
who
was
so
near
my
heart
and
would
have
kept
whirling
round
until
my
limbs
gave
way
under
me
but
the
music
ceased
and
i
led
lottie
to
a
seat
but
i
did
not
get
a
chance
to
enjoy
her
company
many
moments
before
she
was
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
young
men
who
insisted
on
leading
her
to
the
piano
the
musicians
had
laid
down
their
instruments
and
were
enjoying
a
smoke
on
the
veranda
and
lottie
was
urged
to
sing
i
drew
as
near
as
i
could
and
took
my
stand
on
her
left
she
ran
her
fingers
rapidly
over
the
keys
and
then
asked
me
what
she
should
sing
give
us
something
to
remind
us
of
olden
times
very
well
here
is
one
of
my
own
invention
in
the
happy
days
of
yore
a
hero
loved
me
then
let
my
tears
of
sorrow
pour
my
happy
days
are
o
er
for
he
loves
me
now
no
more
he
loved
me
truly
then
oh
what
bliss
it
is
to
know
a
hero
loved
me
then
his
young
heart
was
all
aglow
and
as
pure
as
driven
snow
i
must
let
my
hero
go
he
loved
me
truly
then
all
the
happy
days
are
past
a
hero
loved
me
then
this
poor
heart
is
o
ercast
with
sorrow
s
consuming
blast
my
hero
broke
it
at
last
he
loved
me
truly
then
i
remember
every
vow
a
hero
loved
me
then
it
crowds
my
memory
now
for
he
kissed
me
on
the
brow
then
he
sweetly
told
me
how
he
loved
me
truly
every
time
she
lingered
on
the
words
a
hero
loved
me
then
her
eyes
were
raised
to
mine
for
a
moment
and
i
thought
i
saw
an
appealing
look
in
them
and
a
glance
of
inquiry
when
she
came
to
the
last
three
lines
her
voice
trembled
slightly
and
when
she
fixed
her
beautiful
eyes
on
me
i
saw
that
they
were
moist
though
no
tears
fell
from
them
she
repeated
the
last
three
lines
in
a
low
plaintive
tone
for
a
few
seconds
after
the
last
sweet
sound
had
ceased
not
a
word
was
spoken
lottie
declined
to
sing
any
more
notwithstanding
she
was
urged
to
do
so
by
the
entire
audience
but
she
rose
from
the
piano
and
made
her
way
to
me
and
running
her
arm
under
mine
said
come
eddie
take
me
out
where
we
can
get
a
little
fresh
air
i
am
smothering
in
the
proposition
suited
me
admirably
for
i
was
anxious
to
be
alone
with
her
and
went
out
on
the
portico
and
began
to
walk
up
and
down
the
floor
while
lottie
leaned
on
my
arm
with
her
face
turned
up
toward
mine
i
was
too
happy
to
talk
my
heart
thrilled
with
delight
and
i
remained
silent
after
making
a
few
rounds
on
the
portico
without
speaking
we
took
seats
on
a
low
wooden
bench
where
a
thick
cluster
of
honeysuckle
vines
formed
a
canopy
that
would
conceal
us
from
the
prying
eyes
of
heartsell
and
two
other
young
men
who
were
apparently
watching
us
now
edward
said
lottie
i
want
you
to
tell
me
what
is
the
matter
with
you
come
now
don
t
try
to
deceive
me
for
you
know
you
can
not
do
it
i
have
not
seen
you
smile
you
don
t
look
or
act
as
you
did
in
the
happy
days
of
old
you
were
always
cheerful
and
pleasant
then
but
you
look
pale
and
serious
lottie
i
know
i
could
not
deceive
you
if
i
were
to
try
but
i
have
no
wish
to
do
anything
of
the
sort
i
am
unhappy
but
i
do
not
know
that
i
could
give
any
good
reason
for
it
one
thing
however
i
will
say
and
that
is
i
think
we
shall
never
see
any
more
such
happy
days
as
we
have
spent
together
i
see
a
great
gulf
beginning
to
flow
in
between
you
and
me
which
sooner
or
later
will
drive
us
apart
forever
pshaw
edward
you
ought
not
to
talk
that
way
it
pains
me
deeply
to
hear
it
no
gulf
could
be
made
wide
enough
to
separate
me
from
such
a
dear
good
noble
as
you
have
been
to
me
but
what
do
you
mean
when
you
speak
of
a
gulf
coming
between
us
you
have
an
accomplished
education
a
superior
mind
as
well
as
very
great
beauty
and
are
to
be
a
great
heiress
rockland
is
proud
and
wealthy
and
is
very
fond
of
you
he
will
expect
you
to
marry
some
distinguished
man
of
his
own
choosing
i
may
be
mistaken
but
i
don
t
think
he
would
be
pleased
to
have
me
as
a
frequent
visitor
at
his
house
he
did
not
speak
to
me
but
cast
on
me
a
cold
contemptuous
look
and
bowed
now
see
here
edward
in
the
first
place
i
think
you
are
very
much
mistaken
in
supposing
rockland
dislikes
you
he
is
naturally
a
very
stern
sad
man
but
he
has
a
warm
tender
heart
and
i
believe
he
loves
me
dearly
but
i
tell
you
now
plainly
that
the
man
who
hates
my
dear
noble
brother
must
hate
me
too
and
when
it
comes
to
the
question
of
matrimony
i
guess
i
will
have
something
to
say
about
that
in
the
first
place
i
do
not
want
to
marry
at
all
and
in
the
next
place
i
shall
be
very
certain
never
to
marry
any
man
unless
i
love
him
with
all
my
heart
while
she
was
uttering
the
words
just
mentioned
she
made
the
heels
of
her
little
boots
clatter
against
the
floor
rapidly
and
i
could
see
by
the
sparkle
of
her
eyes
that
she
meant
what
she
said
i
was
partially
pleased
and
partially
vexed
pleased
to
hear
her
say
that
she
never
would
marry
any
man
unless
she
loved
him
vexed
to
hear
her
speak
of
her
love
toward
me
as
a
dear
i
wanted
a
different
sort
of
love
she
now
took
the
beautiful
white
rose
from
her
throat
and
put
it
in
the
of
my
coat
and
while
she
was
doing
so
her
lovely
face
was
within
three
inches
of
mine
and
i
felt
her
cool
breath
gently
touching
my
cheek
when
she
finished
the
job
over
which
i
thought
she
lingered
a
long
time
she
gave
me
a
gentle
slap
on
the
cheek
and
said
there
now
that
is
very
nice
and
i
want
you
to
drive
away
that
ugly
frown
from
your
brow
and
go
in
and
help
me
to
entertain
my
guests
will
you
do
it
yes
lottie
you
know
i
will
do
anything
to
please
you
but
stop
a
moment
i
want
to
know
what
you
meant
by
composing
such
a
song
as
the
one
you
sang
a
moment
ago
who
is
it
that
loved
you
truly
then
and
loves
you
now
no
more
ask
me
no
questions
and
i
will
tell
you
no
falsehoods
but
i
guess
you
could
answer
that
question
better
than
i
could
but
come
along
now
we
must
go
in
for
i
heard
some
one
inquiring
for
me
give
me
your
arm
and
don
t
forget
the
ugly
trust
me
now
lottie
and
i
ll
be
as
polite
to
your
guests
as
a
french
dancing
good
enough
edward
so
come
we
returned
to
the
when
heartsell
came
up
to
engage
lottie
as
his
partner
for
the
next
set
i
beg
you
to
excuse
me
heartsell
i
am
going
to
dance
with
demar
in
this
now
here
was
unmistakable
evidence
of
partiality
on
lottie
s
part
toward
me
for
i
had
not
asked
her
to
dance
with
me
in
fact
i
had
not
intended
to
dance
any
more
that
night
my
went
up
to
a
premium
my
heart
swelled
with
indescribable
delight
and
i
began
to
think
that
after
all
i
was
not
to
be
laid
entirely
on
the
shelf
i
knew
that
heartsell
was
going
to
be
a
suitor
for
lottie
s
hand
and
i
considered
him
my
most
dangerous
rival
as
i
was
aware
of
the
fact
that
he
was
rockland
s
favorite
he
bit
his
lip
with
vexation
as
i
led
lottie
off
to
begin
the
waltz
while
a
feeling
of
triumph
swelled
up
in
my
bosom
when
the
waltz
was
ended
lottie
parted
from
me
as
she
whispered
now
eddie
remember
my
guests
and
try
to
help
to
entertain
as
she
left
me
heartsell
drew
up
in
front
of
me
and
stared
at
me
for
a
moment
while
i
thought
that
i
perceived
something
like
a
sneer
of
contempt
play
for
a
second
on
his
face
hullo
demar
he
exclaimed
where
did
you
get
that
beautiful
white
rose
that
sir
was
fastened
here
by
the
prettiest
girl
in
this
room
i
replied
haughtily
as
i
drew
myself
up
and
walked
away
i
saw
his
cheeks
grow
purple
with
anger
as
he
went
toward
lottie
who
was
talking
with
a
lady
near
by
miss
wallingford
he
said
as
he
bowed
low
before
her
will
you
honor
me
with
a
short
interview
without
uttering
a
word
lottie
took
his
arm
and
was
led
out
through
a
side
door
which
opened
on
the
corridor
they
came
round
on
the
outside
of
the
room
and
stopped
within
six
feet
of
the
seat
where
i
was
and
immediately
opposite
a
window
the
sash
of
which
was
up
but
the
curtains
were
down
i
knew
from
the
tone
of
heartsell
s
voice
that
he
was
angry
with
lottie
about
something
you
seem
to
be
enjoying
yourself
better
than
usual
why
should
i
not
enjoy
myself
when
i
am
among
so
many
good
kind
friends
i
am
truly
glad
to
see
you
enjoying
the
society
of
your
very
good
why
do
you
choose
to
use
the
singular
number
because
if
you
have
any
more
than
one
friend
and
i
am
happy
to
believe
you
have
you
have
been
very
careful
to
avoid
letting
them
know
that
you
recognized
why
heartsell
how
can
you
be
so
unjust
as
to
say
that
how
many
times
have
you
danced
with
me
how
many
times
with
campston
i
have
not
danced
with
him
at
did
he
ask
you
how
many
sets
have
you
danced
with
demar
now
in
the
name
of
all
the
gods
at
once
upon
what
meat
doth
this
our
cæsar
feed
that
he
is
grown
so
great
why
he
doth
bestride
the
narrow
world
like
a
colossus
and
we
petty
men
walk
under
his
huge
legs
and
peep
about
to
find
ourselves
dishonorable
if
your
sarcasm
is
intended
for
demar
i
beg
permission
to
say
that
you
might
find
a
dishonorable
grave
without
peeping
about
his
legs
to
find
oh
i
crave
your
pardon
miss
wallingford
i
assure
you
i
meant
no
offense
but
candidly
i
should
be
glad
to
know
what
demar
has
done
to
entitle
him
to
such
distinguished
privileges
how
is
it
that
this
great
cæsar
can
monopolize
the
beauteous
belle
of
the
ball
while
we
petty
men
must
peep
about
among
common
people
to
find
ourselves
partners
mr
heartsell
it
is
not
agreeable
for
me
to
listen
to
wit
of
this
nature
because
demar
has
been
to
me
a
devoted
friend
a
true
noble
unselfish
brother
look
at
that
scar
on
my
wrist
if
you
well
i
see
it
what
about
that
that
scar
was
made
by
the
poisonous
fangs
of
a
rattlesnake
and
i
would
have
died
in
ten
minutes
but
that
this
generous
heroic
brother
drew
the
poison
from
my
veins
with
his
lips
and
came
very
near
losing
his
own
life
by
the
brave
deed
well
may
you
compare
him
with
cæsar
because
while
you
do
it
in
jest
i
will
do
it
in
earnest
for
his
courage
entitles
him
to
all
the
honors
that
an
inexperienced
girl
like
me
can
bestow
if
it
should
be
my
pleasure
to
grant
him
more
favors
than
i
do
to
other
gentlemen
i
trust
i
can
do
so
without
giving
offense
to
ah
miss
wallingford
you
are
an
eloquent
orator
and
if
cæsar
did
have
his
friend
marcus
antonius
to
defend
him
demar
has
a
more
eloquent
defender
in
you
i
envy
him
and
would
make
any
sacrifice
to
win
such
favors
as
fall
to
his
share
i
dare
say
you
are
quite
lucky
to
have
two
such
brave
good
brothers
as
demar
and
indeed
i
think
so
and
am
happy
in
the
thought
by
the
by
miss
wallingford
you
have
lost
that
beautiful
white
rose
that
i
saw
on
your
throat
a
while
you
are
mistaken
sir
i
did
not
lose
ah
indeed
i
asked
you
to
give
it
to
me
and
you
refused
you
certainly
did
not
present
it
to
another
gentleman
and
why
should
i
not
give
it
to
whom
i
pleased
was
it
not
mine
hem
yes
i
can
not
deny
that
but
such
partiality
as
that
would
clip
an
insult
very
close
and
i
am
loth
to
believe
such
a
charming
lady
as
miss
wallingford
would
offer
an
indignity
to
one
who
loves
and
who
esteems
her
so
highly
as
i
now
heartsell
i
should
be
very
unhappy
if
i
thought
i
had
given
you
any
just
cause
for
offense
but
in
this
instance
i
must
say
it
appears
to
me
that
you
are
manufacturing
a
mountain
out
of
a
if
you
desire
it
i
will
present
you
with
a
basketful
of
roses
this
no
no
you
shall
do
nothing
of
the
sort
it
was
not
the
rose
itself
that
i
cared
for
but
it
was
the
emblem
which
would
have
come
with
it
may
i
know
who
was
the
lucky
donee
certainly
you
may
for
i
assure
you
there
is
no
secret
connected
with
it
i
had
the
she
put
the
accent
heavy
on
the
honor
to
present
the
rose
to
my
noble
heroic
brother
edward
now
we
should
never
use
extravagant
language
and
we
should
worship
no
living
being
except
god
but
on
that
particular
occasion
i
confess
i
committed
such
a
sin
though
if
the
recording
angel
sets
it
down
against
me
i
believe
he
will
credit
me
with
a
partial
justification
at
least
how
could
i
sit
there
and
hear
the
most
charming
woman
in
america
boasting
of
the
she
had
done
herself
by
presenting
a
rose
to
me
and
not
feel
an
inclination
to
fall
down
and
worship
her
how
could
i
hear
her
dear
voice
sounding
eloquently
in
praise
of
me
without
thinking
extravagant
thoughts
the
fact
is
i
was
so
much
excited
that
they
might
have
heard
the
loud
throbbings
of
my
heart
if
they
had
listened
i
determined
however
to
put
an
end
to
heartsell
s
little
because
i
knew
it
would
please
her
i
went
round
on
the
north
side
and
passed
across
coming
up
to
where
they
stood
and
coughed
as
i
approached
in
order
to
notify
lottie
of
my
arrival
your
friends
will
be
curious
to
know
what
has
become
of
their
fair
hostess
miss
wallingford
i
observed
as
i
halted
by
her
side
ah
thank
you
for
reminding
me
of
my
duty
she
replied
as
she
took
my
arm
and
bowed
stiffly
to
heartsell
we
will
finish
our
little
quarrel
at
another
time
no
no
the
victory
is
yours
and
i
make
an
unconditional
surrender
render
unto
cæsar
that
which
is
his
but
don
t
crowd
things
on
him
that
don
t
belong
to
that
fellow
heartsell
is
an
impertinent
scamp
and
i
mean
to
tell
him
if
you
do
you
will
displease
me
beyond
measure
for
i
think
he
is
a
perfect
gentleman
i
am
ashamed
to
say
that
i
have
treated
him
rather
unkindly
and
i
mean
to
apologize
as
soon
as
i
have
an
oh
very
well
if
you
love
him
you
should
let
him
know
it
by
all
means
see
here
edward
i
must
request
you
not
to
mention
heartsell
s
name
in
my
presence
any
more
and
i
will
also
ask
you
to
excuse
me
now
as
i
must
really
mingle
among
my
guests
and
give
them
some
then
she
left
me
and
soon
was
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
young
men
i
did
not
have
a
chance
to
talk
with
her
any
more
that
night
and
when
i
went
home
my
mind
was
full
of
strange
conjectures
and
conflicting
emotions
one
question
appeared
to
be
pretty
well
settled
and
that
was
a
perfect
knowledge
on
my
part
that
all
my
hopes
of
happiness
would
be
destroyed
if
lottie
should
refuse
to
marry
me
love
is
a
strange
passion
and
no
one
knows
how
it
can
upset
a
man
s
equanimity
unless
he
has
learned
it
by
actual
experience
it
is
a
passion
that
produces
indescribable
happiness
to
those
who
are
loved
in
return
but
of
all
the
distressing
pains
and
horrible
torture
that
mortal
man
ever
felt
that
which
he
suffers
when
his
mind
is
racked
with
doubt
on
that
subject
is
the
greatest
i
had
resolved
a
hundred
times
to
have
that
question
settled
but
when
in
lottie
s
presence
my
tongue
was
paralyzed
and
my
brain
refused
to
lay
out
a
sensible
idea
i
had
ordered
a
jeweler
to
make
an
exquisite
gold
ring
with
a
beautiful
diamond
set
and
had
lottie
s
and
my
name
engraved
on
the
inside
this
i
had
carried
in
my
pocket
for
two
weeks
intending
to
ask
her
to
accept
it
as
an
engagement
ring
but
for
reasons
already
stated
i
failed
to
do
it
i
had
written
out
and
memorized
what
i
supposed
to
be
an
eloquent
speech
which
i
intended
to
deliver
with
the
ring
but
my
courage
oozed
out
the
very
moment
those
large
beautiful
blue
eyes
set
their
sight
on
me
lottie
had
a
strange
habit
of
looking
me
square
in
the
face
which
never
failed
to
set
my
limbs
to
trembling
and
my
heart
to
thumping
i
was
considered
a
privileged
guest
at
rockland
s
house
not
by
him
but
by
lottie
and
i
visited
there
often
and
was
frequently
so
unlucky
as
to
meet
heartsell
there
and
sometimes
other
young
men
who
had
entered
the
lists
i
watched
lottie
very
closely
but
i
could
not
tell
whether
she
loved
any
one
of
her
suitors
or
not
so
far
as
i
was
able
to
judge
she
treated
all
alike
i
spent
at
least
three
days
of
each
week
strolling
about
by
lottie
s
side
half
crazy
with
love
for
her
sometimes
buoyed
up
with
hope
at
others
struggling
with
suspense
and
despair
summer
was
about
to
step
out
and
autumn
was
ready
to
walk
in
the
weather
was
hot
and
dry
while
dust
and
heat
hung
about
over
all
things
vegetation
was
parched
and
withered
by
the
long
drought
while
gloom
and
dust
combined
to
make
me
very
miserable
except
when
i
was
lingering
with
lottie
in
her
beautiful
flower
garden
which
owing
to
her
industry
was
always
delightful
and
cool
for
she
had
everything
thoroughly
watered
every
evening
the
east
side
of
her
garden
was
thickly
shaded
with
young
magnolias
whose
broad
green
leaves
protected
the
thick
velvety
turf
that
covered
the
ground
beneath
the
west
side
was
set
apart
for
flowers
alone
and
notwithstanding
the
protracted
drought
that
had
prevailed
they
looked
as
fresh
and
vigorous
as
they
did
in
may
and
june
old
uncle
zack
as
lottie
called
the
old
negro
gardener
was
always
anxious
to
please
his
pretty
nightingale
a
pet
name
he
had
given
lottie
during
her
attendance
at
the
kentucky
school
uncle
zack
had
been
the
manager
of
her
garden
and
her
birds
and
on
her
return
she
found
that
the
duty
had
been
faithfully
performed
a
charming
stood
near
the
east
boundary
of
the
garden
all
covered
over
with
clustering
vines
and
blooming
roses
it
was
at
this
delightful
spot
that
i
had
spent
so
many
happy
hours
with
lottie
a
large
wooden
table
sat
in
the
center
of
the
summer
house
and
low
willow
chairs
were
ranged
around
the
sides
and
when
the
weather
was
fine
the
table
was
covered
with
books
maps
sheet
music
drawing
materials
magazines
and
a
guitar
lottie
called
this
her
study
for
that
was
the
delightful
spot
where
she
practiced
music
and
drawing
and
reviewed
her
studies
generally
the
time
when
i
was
to
start
to
philadelphia
for
the
purpose
of
attending
the
medical
lectures
was
near
at
hand
and
still
i
had
not
been
able
to
muster
up
the
courage
to
make
my
love
known
to
her
doctor
dodson
was
anxious
for
me
to
start
immediately
because
he
was
uneasy
about
my
health
which
was
on
the
decline
but
he
had
no
suspicions
as
to
the
cause
he
thought
that
a
trip
to
the
would
be
beneficial
then
he
had
some
business
at
new
york
and
boston
which
he
wanted
me
to
transact
for
him
i
could
have
told
him
that
no
journey
would
restore
my
health
there
was
one
thing
and
only
one
that
could
ever
bring
health
and
happiness
back
to
me
i
knew
that
could
i
be
assured
of
lottie
s
love
all
would
be
well
with
me
but
if
that
was
denied
i
never
would
know
health
or
happiness
any
more
one
sultry
evening
near
the
end
of
august
when
the
sun
was
about
to
disappear
in
the
west
after
having
scorched
and
burned
the
earth
for
twelve
consecutive
hours
i
found
myself
lingering
in
the
by
lottie
where
i
had
been
for
a
long
time
trying
to
collect
the
necessary
courage
to
tell
her
of
my
love
sing
one
more
song
for
me
lottie
before
i
go
please
said
i
as
i
drew
my
chair
closer
to
hers
what
shall
it
be
she
inquired
as
she
picked
up
her
guitar
and
began
to
run
her
fingers
over
the
strings
i
would
like
to
hear
the
one
you
sang
the
night
of
the
ball
i
do
not
know
its
name
it
says
something
about
a
hero
who
loved
you
in
the
happy
days
of
old
who
loves
you
now
no
oh
yes
i
never
will
forget
that
song
for
it
is
one
of
my
favorites
and
my
own
composition
do
you
like
it
edward
i
like
to
hear
you
sing
it
but
i
do
not
think
i
like
the
sentiment
for
i
am
sure
no
one
ever
loved
you
in
the
days
of
old
who
does
not
love
you
i
saw
a
crimson
tinge
steal
over
her
cheeks
as
her
beautiful
eyes
were
for
a
moment
fixed
on
me
a
hero
did
love
me
long
ago
anyway
though
i
don
t
know
so
well
about
it
now
but
let
that
pass
we
poor
foolish
women
should
never
complain
about
she
then
began
to
tune
the
instrument
which
was
suspended
by
a
broad
blue
ribbon
that
passed
over
her
left
shoulder
and
was
tied
to
a
little
brass
hook
in
each
end
of
the
guitar
lottie
s
voice
seemed
to
be
in
excellent
tune
and
in
all
respects
under
her
control
though
it
was
low
and
tremulous
and
when
she
came
to
the
line
that
said
he
loves
me
now
no
more
she
looked
me
full
in
the
face
and
repeated
the
line
in
a
pathetic
tone
that
brought
the
tears
to
my
eyes
every
vein
in
my
body
was
full
of
hot
blood
when
lottie
came
to
the
last
three
lines
her
voice
sank
to
a
mere
whisper
and
i
could
see
that
some
unusual
emotion
was
at
work
in
her
bosom
she
paused
a
moment
as
the
sweet
echo
of
her
voice
gradually
died
away
and
then
she
turned
round
and
fixing
her
eyes
upon
me
repeated
the
last
verse
i
remember
every
vow
a
hero
loved
me
then
it
crowds
my
memory
now
for
he
kissed
me
on
the
brow
then
he
sweetly
told
me
how
he
loved
me
truly
she
laid
the
guitar
down
and
turned
her
face
another
way
and
as
i
leaned
forward
slightly
i
saw
something
like
a
drop
of
dew
trembling
on
her
cheek
that
little
trembling
tear
settled
my
fate
an
unaccountable
boldness
came
upon
me
and
all
my
timidity
disappeared
and
i
was
rash
impetuous
and
i
might
say
rude
because
i
seized
her
hand
and
pressed
it
to
my
lips
a
dozen
times
in
rapid
succession
my
impetuosity
seemed
to
astonish
and
frighten
her
and
she
began
to
move
away
it
is
time
i
was
in
the
house
edward
said
she
as
she
moved
away
mother
will
be
calling
me
if
i
don
t
no
no
lottie
i
exclaimed
as
i
moved
toward
her
don
t
go
now
remember
i
am
going
away
next
week
to
stay
a
long
long
time
and
we
never
may
meet
again
the
fact
of
the
business
is
i
think
i
never
shall
come
back
to
memphis
any
her
beautiful
face
grew
a
shade
paler
but
she
soon
regained
composure
come
along
then
and
let
me
show
you
my
pretty
birds
she
said
as
she
moved
toward
a
little
latticed
house
that
stood
about
fifty
feet
from
the
i
imagined
she
was
endeavoring
to
get
my
mind
fixed
on
other
subjects
than
the
one
on
which
my
thoughts
were
bent
i
followed
her
and
when
we
entered
the
cozy
little
house
the
old
parrot
began
to
laugh
and
chatter
away
lottie
lottie
lottie
he
screamed
as
he
leaped
down
on
her
shoulder
ah
ha
here
we
come
lottie
lottie
lottie
ah
ha
here
we
come
how
did
he
learn
to
imitate
doctor
dodson
so
perfectly
i
asked
the
doctor
frequently
comes
to
see
me
and
old
roderick
has
heard
him
so
often
that
he
has
caught
his
a
was
singing
in
a
cage
that
sat
on
the
joist
and
a
dozen
canaries
were
making
sweet
music
in
their
little
houses
while
an
old
jackdaw
was
muttering
to
himself
in
a
wire
cage
each
bird
seemed
to
be
making
music
for
his
own
amusement
and
on
his
own
hook
it
was
a
combination
of
discordant
sounds
which
might
have
been
good
music
if
they
could
have
been
induced
to
sing
one
at
a
time
it
was
a
shrewd
maneuver
of
lottie
to
decoy
me
to
that
place
for
no
man
could
talk
loud
enough
to
be
heard
amid
such
an
clatter
as
was
made
by
these
birds
i
concluded
that
she
had
resorted
to
this
strategic
maneuver
in
order
to
avoid
the
disagreeable
revelation
which
she
had
guessed
i
was
about
to
make
then
i
became
angry
and
that
increased
my
courage
and
made
me
quite
reckless
and
i
was
determined
to
know
my
fate
before
i
left
i
believed
she
could
read
my
inmost
thoughts
for
i
had
never
seen
her
more
embarrassed
than
she
was
then
the
sun
had
entirely
disappeared
and
a
dark
purple
bank
began
to
loom
up
in
the
east
indicating
the
approach
of
twilight
while
the
face
of
the
moon
every
now
and
then
peeped
down
through
a
column
of
white
clouds
that
flew
across
the
horizon
as
the
dew
began
to
dampen
the
flowers
around
us
a
delicious
fragrance
arose
and
filled
all
the
air
with
its
ravishing
sweetness
i
took
lottie
s
hand
and
placing
it
under
my
arm
led
her
back
to
the
and
took
a
seat
by
her
side
old
bob
came
up
and
laid
his
head
on
my
knee
and
began
to
whine
and
tried
to
wag
his
tail
but
it
was
too
short
notwithstanding
the
poor
old
dog
was
stone
blind
it
was
plain
that
he
recognized
me
lottie
said
i
this
faithful
old
friend
remembers
me
and
i
am
glad
to
know
that
there
is
one
living
thing
in
this
cold
world
that
cares
for
me
i
want
you
to
take
good
care
of
him
for
my
sake
when
i
am
gone
for
i
guess
i
will
not
see
him
any
more
i
never
shall
forget
those
happy
days
when
we
were
poor
homeless
tramps
penniless
friendless
and
simple
but
hopeful
and
her
face
was
turned
away
her
eyes
were
bent
on
the
ground
and
she
was
busy
plucking
the
tender
leaves
from
a
bunch
of
roses
and
scattering
them
at
her
feet
i
knew
from
the
rise
and
fall
of
her
bosom
that
some
strong
emotion
was
at
work
in
her
breast
but
i
thought
it
was
caused
by
an
unwillingness
to
listen
to
my
melancholy
expressions
taking
her
left
hand
i
enclosed
it
in
both
of
mine
and
after
holding
it
a
moment
i
ventured
to
raise
it
to
my
lips
and
stamp
it
with
many
fervent
kisses
then
i
pressed
it
over
my
loud
throbbing
heart
while
her
face
was
still
turned
away
from
me
i
wonder
if
any
other
man
ever
will
press
this
little
hand
against
his
heart
and
call
it
his
she
instantly
withdrew
it
with
a
sudden
jerk
as
if
an
insect
had
stung
her
and
then
fixing
her
expressive
eyes
on
me
with
a
reproachful
look
said
i
declare
we
must
go
to
the
house
now
mother
does
not
like
to
keep
tea
waiting
for
any
she
will
excuse
you
when
you
inform
her
that
i
was
making
my
farewell
visit
who
knows
that
we
ever
shall
meet
again
in
this
world
once
more
she
turned
her
face
away
and
gazed
on
the
ground
lottie
here
is
a
beautiful
diamond
ring
i
want
you
to
wear
it
will
prevent
you
from
entirely
forgetting
the
one
who
has
always
loved
as
i
uttered
those
words
in
a
trembling
tone
i
took
her
hand
and
slipped
the
ring
on
her
finger
which
she
did
not
resist
nor
did
she
give
any
signs
of
assent
in
fact
she
did
not
seem
to
notice
what
i
was
saying
or
doing
but
i
could
see
that
she
was
deeply
moved
with
excitement
as
her
body
was
trembling
violently
lottie
will
you
write
me
a
letter
occasionally
when
i
am
far
away
from
the
one
i
love
so
dearly
yes
edward
i
will
answer
all
your
after
i
had
placed
the
ring
on
her
finger
i
again
pressed
her
trembling
hand
against
my
heart
lottie
it
will
be
a
long
time
ere
we
meet
again
and
i
suppose
you
will
be
married
to
some
distinguished
man
before
my
return
a
gentle
shake
of
the
head
and
a
slight
jerk
of
the
hand
was
her
only
answer
will
you
ever
think
of
the
boyish
tramp
who
long
ago
claimed
you
as
his
little
wife
after
i
am
gone
yes
edward
i
never
shall
forget
the
halcyon
days
of
old
for
although
we
were
poor
homeless
wanderers
we
were
not
lottie
i
loved
that
pretty
little
tramp
devotedly
then
and
time
has
increased
that
holy
passion
until
it
has
filled
my
heart
my
mind
my
soul
my
brain
my
body
my
thoughts
my
dreams
and
my
blood
fortune
has
not
lavished
her
favors
on
me
but
that
is
not
my
fault
i
know
i
am
ignorant
green
poor
and
uneducated
doomed
to
occupy
an
humble
sphere
in
life
while
the
blind
goddess
has
been
more
liberal
in
the
bestowal
of
her
favors
on
you
your
beauty
and
your
talent
alone
would
have
placed
you
on
a
plane
far
above
my
lowly
valley
but
when
it
is
known
that
you
are
to
be
a
great
heiress
i
feel
as
if
it
would
be
too
presumptuous
on
my
part
to
ask
you
to
be
mine
i
know
that
i
have
a
rough
ugly
and
awkward
appearance
that
i
am
not
such
a
person
as
fine
ladies
love
to
look
on
but
i
possess
a
large
fond
heart
that
holds
an
ocean
of
pure
love
for
you
lottie
why
do
you
not
say
something
why
do
you
turn
your
face
away
from
me
have
i
offended
you
by
my
presumption
if
i
have
dared
to
talk
of
love
to
you
it
does
not
necessarily
follow
that
you
are
bound
to
give
a
favorable
answer
in
fact
i
have
no
right
to
expect
you
to
make
such
a
one
if
you
can
not
love
me
say
so
and
i
promise
never
to
annoy
you
any
more
with
my
suit
but
will
endeavor
to
promote
your
happiness
in
every
way
i
can
i
profess
to
be
a
man
of
honor
and
believe
i
possess
a
remarkable
amount
of
pride
too
much
to
annoy
any
lady
about
my
love
who
can
not
return
my
honorable
her
body
now
began
to
tremble
more
violently
than
ever
shaking
like
a
leaf
stirred
by
the
storm
but
she
still
remained
silent
and
kept
her
face
averted
why
do
you
not
speak
to
me
lottie
am
i
to
understand
that
the
refusal
is
caused
by
the
scorn
you
feel
for
my
presumption
or
is
it
because
you
hate
to
pronounce
the
doom
which
you
know
will
consign
me
to
a
life
of
misery
in
the
name
of
those
happy
days
of
old
in
the
name
of
our
dear
dead
mother
in
the
name
of
the
great
ocean
of
love
which
this
poor
heart
holds
for
you
i
implore
you
to
speak
to
me
now
a
tear
then
fell
from
my
eyes
and
dropped
on
her
hand
which
i
still
held
against
my
heart
that
caused
her
to
start
up
suddenly
and
snatch
her
hand
away
then
she
gazed
down
at
the
tear
which
still
glistened
on
her
hand
and
i
saw
another
tear
start
from
her
left
eye
and
roll
slowly
down
her
cheek
it
trembled
on
her
chin
a
second
and
then
fell
right
on
the
one
that
still
sparkled
on
her
hand
the
two
tears
mingled
into
one
and
as
they
did
so
her
head
suddenly
fell
against
my
heart
and
then
i
knew
that
the
great
prize
was
mine
looking
up
into
my
face
with
a
gaze
of
unutterable
sweetness
while
tears
were
streaming
from
her
beautiful
eyes
she
whispered
eddie
i
have
always
loved
you
more
than
language
can
express
or
mind
can
imagine
and
i
was
sure
you
knew
it
all
the
time
i
have
never
thought
of
loving
any
one
else
and
i
do
not
mean
to
allow
you
to
slander
yourself
any
more
in
my
presence
as
you
have
done
here
this
evening
for
i
think
you
generous
intelligent
and
brave
and
i
know
you
are
very
handsome
i
was
too
full
of
joy
to
speak
and
the
man
who
never
kissed
the
lips
of
a
pure
woman
with
a
knowledge
that
her
virtuous
heart
was
all
his
own
can
not
understand
the
indescribable
bliss
that
was
mine
edward
she
whispered
while
her
large
liquid
blue
eyes
were
rooted
on
me
have
you
ever
read
romeo
and
juliet
yes
darling
very
often
but
why
do
you
ask
the
question
my
love
for
you
is
like
that
which
juliet
felt
for
romeo
i
gave
you
my
heart
long
long
ago
and
if
i
had
it
back
again
then
i
would
borrow
her
sweet
words
which
she
employs
in
speaking
to
romeo
but
to
be
frank
and
give
it
thee
again
and
yet
i
wish
but
for
the
thing
i
have
my
bounty
is
as
boundless
as
the
sea
my
love
as
deep
the
more
i
give
to
thee
the
more
i
have
for
both
are
the
sentiment
is
very
sweet
and
the
language
appropriate
and
expressive
but
i
trust
that
our
love
will
not
end
so
sadly
as
did
that
of
romeo
and
in
the
midst
of
my
great
joy
i
did
not
forget
to
return
my
sincere
thanks
to
the
great
creator
for
bestowing
on
me
such
a
precious
gem
lottie
dear
i
believe
if
you
would
try
you
could
compose
a
sweet
song
suited
to
this
occasion
and
i
hope
you
will
do
so
and
sing
it
here
every
evening
while
i
am
far
away
make
the
effort
and
i
dare
say
you
will
compose
one
with
sentiments
as
sweet
as
ever
poet
wrote
then
fix
an
hour
at
which
you
will
come
to
this
very
spot
and
sing
it
and
i
will
at
the
same
hour
steal
away
and
commune
with
you
in
spirit
while
i
gaze
on
yonder
bright
star
and
listen
with
my
imagination
to
the
sweet
music
my
darling
is
making
here
for
edward
i
promise
to
make
the
attempt
and
if
i
succeed
i
will
sing
it
here
at
this
lovely
spot
every
evening
at
precisely
nine
o
clock
when
the
sky
is
cloudless
and
i
will
think
of
you
while
singing
and
will
my
darling
promise
to
be
mine
when
i
return
thereby
making
me
the
happiest
man
that
ever
walked
on
the
earth
if
papa
gives
his
consent
and
if
brother
harry
is
willing
and
if
you
do
not
fall
in
love
with
and
marry
some
beauteous
philadelphia
belle
and
if
i
do
not
die
of
loneliness
while
you
are
so
far
away
from
me
and
if
you
do
not
withdraw
the
proposition
and
if
upon
reflection
you
are
willing
to
take
me
with
all
my
imperfections
why
then
i
reckon
now
there
are
a
great
many
if
s
contained
in
that
answer
but
let
it
rain
if
s
until
i
return
and
i
will
surmount
them
all
if
my
path
was
sown
thick
with
dragons
teeth
and
at
every
step
producing
armed
men
to
oppose
me
i
would
march
on
to
secure
my
great
prize
edward
can
you
not
postpone
the
time
set
for
you
to
start
to
philadelphia
for
a
few
weeks
yes
and
will
gladly
do
so
for
i
must
settle
the
question
of
the
if
s
before
i
go
i
must
know
rockland
s
mind
as
well
as
harry
s
in
regard
to
our
betrothal
before
i
leave
chapter
x
well
said
ivanhoe
to
scottie
what
was
it
you
wished
to
say
to
me
oh
i
was
dying
of
curiosity
you
see
and
i
thought
maybe
you
could
save
my
life
by
telling
me
something
i
declare
something
strange
is
going
to
happen
and
you
must
tell
me
what
it
it
would
be
an
easy
task
to
tell
you
all
about
it
if
i
knew
anything
about
it
myself
but
as
i
happen
to
know
nothing
how
can
i
tell
you
anything
pshaw
you
are
no
true
knight
sir
ivanhoe
else
you
would
not
let
a
lady
die
of
sheer
curiosity
without
an
effort
to
save
her
you
are
not
like
the
brave
knight
of
ivanhoe
of
sir
walter
scott
s
show
me
an
enemy
who
fights
with
steel
face
to
face
and
then
you
ll
have
cause
to
change
your
mind
by
the
by
what
discoveries
have
you
made
about
the
black
domino
very
little
i
assure
you
just
enough
to
keep
me
on
the
rack
but
have
you
really
unearthed
no
secret
respecting
the
two
seedy
men
just
enough
to
keep
me
on
the
rack
well
aren
t
you
going
to
tell
me
what
it
is
i
have
been
setting
greek
against
greek
and
you
know
what
byron
says
will
happen
when
greek
meets
oh
bother
byron
and
his
greeks
tell
me
what
you
know
i
bribed
the
and
set
her
on
the
track
of
the
seedy
and
pray
what
s
the
result
they
are
detectives
that
much
i
have
discovered
through
my
good
what
else
they
are
shadowing
some
one
on
this
they
are
doing
what
to
some
one
on
this
boat
shadowing
oh
is
that
all
you
mean
that
they
are
keeping
some
one
out
of
the
no
no
i
mean
to
tell
you
that
they
have
spotted
their
spotted
their
man
poor
fellow
what
color
were
the
spots
they
put
on
him
ah
scottie
i
perceive
that
you
are
not
posted
in
regard
to
the
peculiar
language
usually
employed
by
the
police
department
when
a
detective
officer
sees
a
man
who
he
thinks
is
the
one
he
wishes
to
catch
he
begins
to
follow
and
watch
him
and
this
is
called
shadowing
ah
indeed
then
what
is
meant
by
spotting
their
man
the
same
yes
yes
i
see
now
but
who
have
they
been
spotting
or
shadowing
goodness
gracious
is
it
possible
it
is
not
only
possible
but
it
is
absolutely
i
declare
that
is
too
bad
if
i
were
a
man
i
d
pitch
em
both
overboard
so
i
would
they
look
like
a
brace
of
sneak
thieves
anyhow
what
can
they
want
with
ingomar
that
i
don
t
know
but
you
may
be
sure
i
ll
find
out
ere
long
for
i
have
got
a
clever
detective
on
their
track
in
other
words
i
have
got
them
if
a
hundred
witnesses
were
to
swear
that
ingomar
was
a
criminal
i
wouldn
t
believe
don
t
believe
anything
unless
you
want
to
but
what
would
you
think
if
it
should
turn
out
after
all
that
ingomar
has
murdered
his
rival
in
love
oh
horrible
don
t
speak
so
i
beseech
you
such
things
have
happened
and
why
not
happen
again
yes
but
ingomar
is
not
a
man
of
that
sort
i
d
risk
my
life
on
well
now
i
have
told
you
all
i
know
let
s
hear
about
the
black
i
have
found
out
scarcely
anything
except
the
fact
that
she
is
very
sad
and
is
often
found
weeping
in
her
i
have
been
watching
her
closely
though
she
seems
to
avoid
me
as
much
as
she
can
i
think
the
old
gentleman
with
the
white
beard
is
her
uncle
and
i
heard
her
say
to
him
this
morning
that
she
could
not
endure
it
much
endure
what
much
longer
that
was
all
i
heard
but
she
was
weeping
as
if
her
heart
would
break
and
the
old
gentleman
tried
to
comfort
her
and
i
heard
him
say
that
the
matter
should
be
settled
in
some
way
what
matter
did
he
say
should
be
settled
how
should
i
know
i
have
told
you
all
i
i
ll
put
my
detectives
on
her
track
too
and
i
ll
unravel
this
business
if
it
takes
all
the
money
i
possess
see
here
scottie
did
you
know
that
i
am
dying
with
curiosity
to
know
your
real
name
indeed
i
did
well
it
s
so
and
why
not
relieve
me
because
the
queen
would
be
offended
if
i
were
to
do
tell
me
your
real
name
and
the
queen
shall
never
know
of
you
shall
know
me
when
i
know
you
and
not
very
well
that
is
fair
at
all
events
and
i
am
content
but
i
see
the
queen
beckoning
us
to
come
to
our
seats
to
listen
to
ingomar
s
as
soon
as
the
maskers
were
seated
the
queen
ordered
ingomar
to
resume
the
next
morning
after
lottie
had
promised
to
be
my
wife
i
mentioned
the
subject
to
doctor
dodson
as
i
considered
it
my
duty
to
do
so
i
am
going
to
be
married
sir
said
i
as
soon
as
i
get
my
ah
ha
indeed
and
pray
who
s
to
be
the
unlucky
woman
that
you
have
resolved
to
render
miserable
for
life
i
don
t
intend
to
make
any
woman
miserable
neither
do
i
expect
to
marry
any
i
said
this
rather
sharply
as
i
felt
a
little
ruffled
ah
ha
and
you
don
t
mean
to
marry
a
woman
yet
you
say
you
are
going
to
be
married
i
suppose
you
expect
to
marry
a
or
a
fairy
i
guess
you
do
not
aspire
to
an
that
s
exactly
the
state
of
my
case
it
s
an
angel
sure
when
did
she
light
on
this
part
of
the
globe
seven
years
ah
ha
here

come
you
sly
old
rascal

see
how
it
is
now
i
have
suspected
you
of
villainous
designs
against
lottie
for
some
time
and
i
see
i
was
not
mistaken
but
look
here
my
boy
that
dear
girl
is
too
good
for
you
she
s
worth
a
thousand
such
bundles
of
humanity
as
you
and
right
here
let
me
say
a
few
words
with
the
bark
on
them
if
ever
you
speak
a
cross
word
to
that
dear
girl
or
give
her
an
unkind
look
the
fact
is
if
you
ever
give
her
cause
to
regret
her
choice
i
ll
i
ll
yes
i
ll
ah
ha
i
ll
give
you
a
dose
of
strychnine
which
is
considered
by
the
profession
the
most
polite
way
of
getting
rid
of
mean
dogs
ah
ha
don
t
you
see
my
boy
he
gave
me
a
punch
under
the
arm

his
thumb

ll
poison
you

i
would
a
rat
or
a
dog
if

dare
to
cause
my
little
queen
a
moment

i
promise

the
strychnine

left
doctor
dodson
had
the
utmost
contempt
for
idle
young
men
and
usually
expressed
his
opinion
in
language
by
no
means
complimentary
to
that
class
i
was
highly
pleased
to
know
that
i
was
to
be
admitted
into
the
firm
as
an
equal
partner
it
would
enable
me
to
support
my
lottie
as
a
lady
in
that
station
of
life
to
which
her
accomplishments
and
beauty
entitled
her
it
was
my
duty
to
make
known
my
engagement
to
rockland
and
to
ask
his
consent
to
our
marriage
and
this
was
a
task
which
i
dreaded
exceedingly
because
i
was
not
so
sure
that
he
would
sanction
the
union
rockland
was
a
lawyer
who
had
accumulated
a
splendid
fortune
by
his
profession
and
he
was
one
of
those
austere
kind
of
men
whose
ambition
had
usurped
many
of
his
good
qualities
yet
he
loved
lottie
with
all
his
heart
and
so
did
his
wife
but
i
had
a
strong
suspicion
that
they
were
inclined
to
encourage
heartsell
in
his
suit
for
lottie
s
hand
the
more
i
thought
the
matter
over
the
more
i
dreaded
to
mention
it
to
rockland
i
had
a
high
regard
for
him
because
he
loved
lottie
he
had
given
her
a
home
a
real
happy
home
where
she
had
been
surrounded
with
all
the
comforts
and
luxuries
that
money
could
procure
he
had
given
her
a
education
nay
more
than
that
he
had
educated
harry
who
was
now
preparing
to
enter
the
legal
profession
with
brilliant
prospects
rockland
was
always
busy
in
fact
he
was
injuring
his
health
by
incessant
labor
and
i
knew
he
would
be
annoyed
if
i
should
attempt
to
seek
an
interview
with
him
during
business
hours
i
therefore
watched
for
an
opportunity
to
speak
to
him
when
he
should
be
passing
from
his
office
to
his
residence
one
evening
about
three
days
after
lottie
had
promised
to
marry
me
i
saw
rockland
walking
toward
his
residence
with
a
large
bundle
of
papers
under
his
arm
he
was
looking
very
pale
and
sad
and
i
felt
my
knees
trembling
as
i
approached
him
for
the
purpose
of
speaking
to
him
about
lottie
are
you
in
a
great
hurry
rockland
i
inquired
timidly
yes
edward
was
the
solemn
answer
i
am
always
in
a
hurry
but
why
do
you
ask
the
question
i
was
wanting
to
speak
to
you
about
a
matter
of
great
moment
but
if
you
are
busy
i
can
will
it
occupy
much
time
edward
no
then
walk
with
me
to
my
residence
and
i
ll
hear
what
you
have
to
i
walked
in
silence
by
his
side
as
he
led
the
way
to
his
home
lottie
met
us
at
the
gate
and
greeted
rockland
with
a
kiss
then
took
my
arm
what
is
the
matter
with
you
eddie
you
look
as
if
you
had
been
you
must
be
mistaken
lottie
for
i
never
was
in
better
health
in
my
come
then
with
me
into
the
garden
i
wish
to
show
you
my
new
pet
it
is
the
prettiest
one
of
i
beg
you
will
excuse
me
just
now
i
have
come
to
see
rockland
on
a
matter
of
importance
and
he
has
kindly
granted
me
an
interview
when
that
is
attended
to
i
shall
be
more
than
pleased
to
see
your
she
looked
inquiringly
up
into
my
face
oh
very
well
i
will
excuse
you
on
that
plea
you
know
you
men
are
always
thinking
of
i
don
t
think
she
had
any
idea
of
the
nature
of
the
business
i
had
come
to
attend
to
she
walked
by
my
side
till
we
arrived
at
the
house
then
placing
her
mouth
to
my
ear
she
whispered
don
t
be
long
about
the
business
i
am
dying
to
be
with
what
s
that
you
are
whispering
to
edward
about
lottie
said
rockland
with
his
low
solemn
voice
oh
never
mind
papa
you
go
in
and
attend
to
your
business
and
don
t
be
inquisitive
you
are
so
much
accustomed
to
witnesses
in
court
that
you
wish
to
practice
on
me
to
keep
from
getting
rusted
you
can
t
pump
me
as
you
do
other
witnesses
so
there
now
go
along
about
your
and
as
she
finished
the
sentence
she
threw
her
arms
about
his
neck
and
gave
him
two
or
three
kisses
now
go
you
dear
old
darling
you
then
she
went
capering
off
toward
the
garden
while
rockland
s
eyes
followed
her
with
an
eager
look
of
intense
love
ah
demar
said
he
as
he
stood
and
gazed
at
lottie
she
is
the
sweetest
darling
in
the
world
do
you
know
that
i
love
her
just
as
much
as
i
could
if
she
were
my
own
child
she
is
the
most
extraordinary
girl
i
ever
saw
sir
the
most
charming
disposition
sings
like
a
nightingale
i
have
employed
an
eminent
music
teacher
and
mean
to
bring
out
her
great
genius
she
has
been
taught
music
but
it
was
by
ordinary
teachers
the
one
i
have
secured
lately
is
of
a
different
sort
the
fact
of
the
business
is
demar
that
girl
has
so
wound
herself
about
my
heart
that
it
would
kill
me
to
lose
her
my
wife
loves
her
dearly
but
sir
the
feeling
i
have
for
her
goes
beyond
mere
love
it
is
something
like
idolatry
soul
worship
something
which
one
may
feel
but
which
he
can
t
describe
i
mean
to
will
all
my
property
to
lottie
and
i
may
be
permitted
to
say
to
you
demar
confidentially
that
it
will
be
no
inconsiderable
sum
she
will
be
ahead
of
any
girl
in
memphis
so
far
as
wealth
is
concerned
and
far
beyond
them
in
the
way
of
accomplishments
be
seated
demar
said
rockland
at
the
same
time
taking
his
seat
at
the
table
opposite
to
me
i
ll
hear
you
i
gasped
for
breath
and
felt
like
one
choking
i
struggled
desperately
to
regain
and
succeeded
sooner
than
i
thought
i
should
the
fact
is
i
became
very
angry
at
seeing
the
cold
unfeeling
expression
that
settled
on
rockland
s
face
and
i
began
to
reason
with
myself
why
should
i
tremble
in
this
man
s
presence
why
should
i
be
afraid
of
him
what
right
had
he
acquired
that
he
should
be
able
to
hold
my
fate
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
what
if
he
did
love
lottie
didn
t
i
love
her
more
than
he
did
why
should
i
be
compelled
to
come
as
an
humble
suppliant
to
him
begging
him
to
give
lottie
to
me
what
right
had
he
to
give
her
to
anybody
how
came
she
to
be
his
property
who
should
dare
dispute
my
superior
claim
to
her
mr
rockland
said
i
lottie
has
promised
to
be
my
wife
and
i
thought
perhaps
it
was
proper
to
tell
you
of
i
did
not
ask
his
consent
which
it
was
really
my
duty
to
do
but
as
i
have
said
i
was
angry
at
the
austerity
and
coldness
of
his
manner
and
tried
to
assume
an
independence
which
i
now
think
was
wrong
rockland
made
a
grab
at
a
chancery
bill
that
lay
near
him
and
commenced
turning
over
the
pages
as
if
he
were
looking
in
it
for
an
answer
to
my
words
i
thought
i
saw
a
slight
tremulousness
in
his
hand
as
he
held
the
paper
while
his
face
turned
a
shade
paler
it
was
very
imprudent
in
lottie
to
say
the
least
of
it
and
i
must
say
demar
that
common
courtesy
should
have
induced
you
to
mention
the
matter
to
me
before
saying
anything
to
lottie
she
is
young
and
inexperienced
much
too
young
to
think
of
i
will
wait
sir
until
she
is
old
enough
said
i
mr
rockland
patted
the
floor
with
his
and
tapped
the
table
with
the
chancery
bill
and
i
thought
he
was
viewing
me
with
contempt
the
blood
burned
in
my
cheeks
and
doubtless
made
them
very
red
he
remained
silent
for
some
time
as
if
undecided
as
to
what
he
should
say
next
at
length
he
struck
the
table
a
sharp
blow
with
the
bill
and
said
lottie
is
not
my
daughter
demar
but
she
has
been
placed
under
my
protection
and
i
consider
it
to
be
my
duty
to
act
in
this
matter
as
if
she
were
my
own
child
doubtless
she
imagines
that
she
is
in
love
with
you
young
girls
of
her
age
always
act
foolishly
no
doubt
but
i
suppose
it
to
be
a
mere
childish
fancy
and
not
as
you
imagine
a
real
love
affair
therefore
you
will
pardon
me
for
suggesting
the
propriety
of
canceling
what
you
are
pleased
to
call
an
engagement
leaving
her
free
to
act
as
her
best
judgment
may
dictate
when
she
arrives
at
an
age
that
will
enable
her
to
view
things
from
a
more
matured
if
lottie
wishes
to
cancel
the
engagement
rockland
it
may
be
done
but
sir
i
think
you
are
mistaken
when
you
conclude
that
her
love
for
me
is
a
mere
girlish
fancy
we
have
loved
each
other
for
many
years
and
i
assure
you
it
is
no
common
love
no
doubt
you
think
so
demar
and
your
confidence
in
that
respect
may
help
us
to
arrive
at
a
proper
understanding
if
as
you
think
she
really
loves
you
with
such
a
true
devotion
you
certainly
will
not
object
to
allowing
the
engagement
to
be
canceled
with
the
understanding
that
it
may
be
remade
when
lottie
shall
arrive
at
the
age
of
provided
she
then
may
wish
i
can
only
repeat
what
i
have
said
before
rockland
if
lottie
wishes
to
be
released
by
all
means
let
it
be
done
otherwise
i
must
beg
you
to
let
the
engagement
remain
undisturbed
but
sir
i
am
willing
that
the
marriage
may
be
postponed
until
i
shall
have
obtained
my
diploma
and
settled
down
to
work
in
my
profession
meantime
understand
me
sir
if
at
any
time
lottie
shall
intimate
a
wish
to
be
released
from
her
engagement
i
promise
to
raise
no
very
well
sir
if
such
is
your
decision
i
must
acquiesce
of
course
therefore
you
must
promise
not
to
mention
the
matter
to
lottie
any
more
until
i
shall
have
interviewed
her
on
the
certainly
i
give
you
the
promise
most
you
must
promise
further
than
that
demar
you
must
pledge
your
honor
not
to
speak
to
lottie
at
all
until
i
have
had
a
talk
with
her
she
is
in
the
garden
now
you
will
return
to
your
place
of
business
and
allow
me
to
make
your
excuse
for
leaving
without
seeing
i
hesitated
because
my
suspicions
were
roused
i
did
not
like
the
cold
iron
look
that
appeared
on
his
face
nor
the
evasive
expression
of
his
piercing
dark
eyes
i
was
afraid
he
intended
to
make
lottie
believe
it
was
my
wish
that
the
marriage
engagement
should
be
broken
off
else
why
was
he
so
anxious
for
me
to
go
away
without
seeing
her
noticing
my
hesitation
he
evidently
divined
the
cause
for
he
said
oh
you
need
not
fear
to
make
the
promise
demar
i
will
do
everything
openly
and
above
board
i
shall
of
course
endeavor
to
convince
lottie
of
the
great
error
she
has
committed
no
dishonorable
means
shall
be
resorted
to
i
shall
say
nothing
to
her
behind
your
back
that
i
would
not
say
to
your
face
but
i
only
wish
to
have
a
talk
with
her
alone
when
she
is
not
influenced
by
your
presence
that
s
all
i
assure
you
you
will
not
try
to
make
her
believe
that
i
wish
the
engagement
broken
certainly
not
how
could
i
do
that
when
i
know
you
don
t
wish
anything
of
the
sort
his
frank
candid
manner
me
and
i
made
the
promise
and
immediately
took
my
leave
as
i
passed
out
through
the
gate
lottie
saw
me
and
called
me
to
come
to
her
i
shook
my
head
and
passed
on
notwithstanding
the
distance
that
lay
between
us
i
could
plainly
see
the
look
of
astonishment
that
overspread
her
beautiful
face
she
had
started
to
meet
me
almost
in
a
run
but
when
she
perceived
that
i
was
avoiding
her
she
came
to
a
sudden
halt
and
the
little
basket
she
held
in
her
hand
instantly
fell
to
the
ground
scattering
the
flowers
round
her
feet
while
she
appeared
to
be
struck
dumb
with
wonder
what
could
i
do
had
i
not
given
my
most
solemn
promise
not
to
speak
to
her
until
rockland
could
have
an
interview
with
her
when
i
saw
the
painful
expression
of
her
dear
face
i
wheeled
round
and
started
toward
her
then
recollecting
the
promise
i
had
made
i
hastened
away
i
began
to
snuff
danger
in
the
breeze
mr
rockland
was
an
honorable
man
so
were
cæsar
s
assassins
all
honorable
men
rockland
thought
it
was
his
duty
to
prevent
the
marriage
between
lottie
and
me
the
lean
and
hungry
cassius
thought
it
was
his
duty
to
kill
cæsar
rockland
did
not
think
of
this
poor
heart
of
mine
or
care
how
it
would
wither
and
die
if
he
took
lottie
from
me
brutus
did
not
think
or
care
for
the
heart
of
his
friend
as
he
plucked
away
the
bloody
blade
from
cæsar
s
heart
if
rockland
thought
it
was
his
duty
to
have
the
engagement
broken
off
i
felt
certain
that
he
would
leave
no
means
unused
which
would
tend
to
accomplish
it
i
thought
then
and
think
yet
he
was
really
an
honest
conscientious
man
but
what
will
a
man
not
do
in
order
to
gain
his
object
when
he
feels
that
in
doing
it
he
is
performing
his
duty
more
cruelties
have
been
committed
by
men
while
doing
what
they
believed
to
be
their
duty
than
ever
were
committed
wantonly
i
suppose
that
jeffries
the
bloody
tool
of
a
tyrant
thought
he
was
performing
his
duty
as
an
impartial
judge
when
he
was
making
all
the
air
of
england
shriek
with
the
cries
of
dying
victims
i
left
rockland
in
his
library
he
rang
a
little
bell
which
was
answered
by
a
servant
tell
lottie
i
wish
to
see
her
in
my
library
in
a
few
moments
she
came
in
with
an
inquiring
look
on
her
face
what
is
it
papa
tell
me
quick
i
am
in
a
great
she
had
come
up
behind
his
chair
and
was
running
her
fingers
through
his
gray
hair
every
now
and
then
pressing
a
kiss
on
his
brow
oh
you
dear
old
darling
why
don
t
you
commence
can
t
you
see
i
am
all
attention
what
made
you
let
eddie
run
off
like
a
thief
don
t
you
think
when
i
called
him
back
he
shook
his
shaggy
head
and
refused
to
come
now
papa
dear
what
have
you
been
doing
to
my
eddie
how
came
he
to
be
your
eddie
because
he
loves
me
and
i
love
him
now
the
cat
s
out
of
the
nonsense
child
i
implore
you
not
to
talk
so
no
nonsense
about
it
at
all
pray
where
does
the
foolish
part
come
in
is
it
wrong
papa
to
love
such
a
dear
fellow
as
my
eddie
it
was
wrong
for
a
girl
of
your
age
to
enter
into
an
engagement
without
consulting
any
one
and
that
was
what
i
wished
to
speak
to
you
oh
indeed
was
it
now
you
dear
old
darling
you
aren
t
going
to
scold
me
about
it
are
you
no
of
course
you
won
t
if
you
do
i
ll
make
your
tea
as
weak
as
water
and
i
ll
put
pepper
in
your
toast
till
it
shall
burn
you
up
indeed
i
will
i
couldn
t
have
the
heart
to
scold
my
darling
as
rockland
said
this
he
threw
his
arms
round
her
waist
and
drew
her
to
his
heart
covering
her
brow
with
a
kiss
rockland
was
vanquished
her
charms
were
irresistible
and
the
great
lawyer
with
nerves
of
steel
and
an
iron
will
who
could
witnesses
intimidate
judges
and
facts
found
himself
confounded
vanquished
and
helpless
all
done
by
a
pretty
face
and
two
large
dreamy
blue
eyes
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
rockland
loved
lottie
so
devotedly
that
he
was
unable
to
withstand
her
displeasure
take
a
seat
lottie
he
said
and
let
us
come
to
an
understanding
in
this
business
at
once
sit
down
and
we
will
talk
the
matter
over
dispassionately
like
sensible
lottie
took
a
chair
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
and
fixing
her
beautiful
eyes
on
him
said
i
ll
hear
what
you
have
to
say
the
man
of
iron
returned
the
gaze
with
a
cold
calm
look
after
a
long
silence
he
said
lottie
my
dear
child
you
know
i
love
you
as
i
love
life
the
only
aim
i
have
is
to
promote
your
happiness
and
i
demand
of
you
permission
to
cancel
this
foolish
engagement
which
you
have
so
imprudently
entered
into
with
edward
demar

i
your
permission
to
cancel
it
only
on
condition
that
eddie
wishes
it
to
be
mr
demar
did
not
say
he
wished
the
engagement
canceled
but
he
agreed
that
it
should
be
done
if
you
were
willing
and
authorized
me
to
say
as
much
to
the
blood
left
her
cheeks
for
a
moment
then
came
back
with
a
tremendous
rush
yet
she
managed
to
keep
calm
send
for
eddie
now
papa
and
let
me
hear
him
say
he
is
willing
to
annul
our
that
is
unnecessary
lottie
you
have
my
word
that

is
his
wish
and
you
know
me
too
well
to
suspect
me
of
prevarication
again
i
command
you
to
break
off
this
most
absurd
and
imprudent
engagement
will
you
or
will
you
not
do
it
i
demand
an
answer
yes
or
no
lottie
s
bosom
rose
and
fell
with
unusual
emotion
while
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
rockland
yes
or
no
lottie
again
demanded
the
man
of
iron
dear
dear
papa
for
heaven
s
sake
don
t
ask
me
to
be
false
to
the
man

him
until

returns
from
philadelphia
by
that
time
i
will
be
better
able
to
make
you
a
sensible
answer
but
i
beseech
you
not
to
press
me
so
now
you

how
i
love
you

how
much
i
appreciate
your
kindness
to
me

my
entreaty

time

moment

to
make
an
answer
to
such
a
sensible
request
any
girl
whose
judgment
was
not
choked
with
a
foolish
infatuation
would
be
able
to
answer
such
a
reasonable
demand
without
a
moment
s
reflection
do
you
wish
to
tie
yourself
to
a
man
who
is
anxious
to
get
rid
of
you
no
no
a
thousand
times
no
papa
and
no
one
knows
this
better
than

lottie

the
last
time
i
demand
authority
from
you
to
cancel
this
foolish
engagement
will
you
or
will
you
not
give
it
not
unless
eddie
wishes
it
was
the
calm
reply
at
last
the
man
of
iron
lost
his
temper
then
miss
wallingford
you
will
oblige
me
by
seeking
a
home
oh
papa
dear
darling
papa
please
unsay
those
cruel
words
i
am
not
afraid
of
hardships

am
i
afraid
of
poverty
but
it
is
your
displeasure
that
i
dread
more
than
all
i
love

truly
earnestly
devotedly
as
much
as
any
child
ever
loved
a
parent
oh
papa
revoke
those
cruel
words
leave
me
leave
me
thundered
the
lawyer
as
he
pushed
lottie
away
from
him
rather
roughly
she
retreated
to
the
farther
end
of
the
room
and
stared
at
rockland
with
astonishment
while
a
mysterious
change
came
over
her
she
approached
the
table
took
a
seat
and
hastily
penned
a
note
to
edward
demar
dear
eddie
come
to
me
as
quickly
as
you
can
i
wish
to
consult
you
on
important
business
yours
then
she
touched
a
little
silver
bell
that
lay
on
the
table
and
a
bowed
himself
in
at
the
door
did
you
ring
miss
inquired
the
servant

this
note
to
edward
demar
without
delay

tell

to

the
man

scarcely

the
veranda
when
burley
a
mulatto
woman
appeared
at
the
door
did
you
send
for
me

clothes

the
large
trunk

and
we

shall
have
your
own
way
in
lottie
of
course
went
into
rockland
s
arms
and
covered
his
brow
with
kisses
that
was
what
i
call
a
triumph
of
woman
s
rights
here
was
a
lawyer
who
commanded
money
influenced
courts
directed
banks
intimidated
witnesses
cleared
guilty
clients
compelled
judges
to
bow
to
his
great
talent
and
then
in
comes
a
weak
little
girl
and
rules
him
the
same
as
a
raw
recruit
is
ruled
by
the
commanding
general
she
bids
him
go
and
he
goes
she
commands
him
to
come
and
he
comes
talk
about
woman
s
rights
what
on
earth
do
women
want
with
any
more
rights
than
they
have
they
have
complete
control
of
the
world
because
they
control
man
and
through
him
the
there
is
the
gong
for
lunch
observed
the
queen
and
you
may
suspend
until
it
is
over
it
is
our
wish
though
that
our
friends
here
immediately
after
luncheon
to
hear
more
of
the
chapter
xi
suppose
you
and
i
don
t
go
down
to
luncheon
said
scottie
to
ivanhoe
i
am
not
a
bit
hungry
and
would
very
much
prefer
remaining
up
here
how
is
it
with
you
that
s
my
fix
exactly
i
m
glad
you
mentioned
it
take
my
arm
and
let
us
have
a
walk
and
a
talk
agreed
now
what
did
your
spy
report
a
moment
ago
about
the
two
detectives
i
shall
find
out
everything
that
is
going
on
it
is
such
rare
sport
too
to
be
tracking
detectives
who
imagine
themselves
to
be
so
clever
oh
bother
the
clever
detectives
tell
me
what
you
now
scottie
don
t
you
begin
to
lose
your
temper
you
know
i
have
made
a
confidante
of
i
think
you
and
i
ought
to
be
very
good
so
do
i
think
we
ought
to
know
more
about
each
so
do
when
do
you
intend
to
tell
me
who
you
are
scottie
as
soon
as
the
queen
gives
her
what
has
the
queen
got
to
do
with
it
i
should
like
to
know
no
doubt
you
would
but
i
have
given
my
solemn
promise
not
to
reveal
her
name
nor
my
own
to
any
person
without
her
permission
and
she
has
promised
that
as
soon
as
ingomar
s
story
is
finished
all
secrecy
may
be
discarded
but
now
i
want
to
hear
what
you
have
discovered
about
the
two
seedy
they
are
going
to
arrest
ingomar
and
take
him
off
at
vicksburg
he
is
charged
with
a
bloody
murder
so
the
seedy
men
say
they
state
that
he
committed
the
crime
somewhere
in
mississippi
and
while
in
jail
awaiting
trial
managed
to
make
his
escape
the
friends
of
the
murdered
man
offered
a
large
reward
for
the
capture
of
the
perpetrator
and
then
the
state
added
another
large
sum
to
that
offered
by
the
friends
of
the
deceased
and
those
two
seedy
men
are
officers
from
mississippi
who
have
got
ingomar
does
ingomar
know
they
are
watching
him
no
i
think
then
why
not
warn
him
of
the
danger
that
would
be
wrong
because
if
he
is
guilty
he
ought
to
suffer
if
he
is
innocent
he
is
in
no
do
you
believe
he
is
guilty
i
can
t
say
that
i
do
for
i
know
nothing
about
it
i
shall
therefore
accept
the
legal
theory
which
regards
every
man
innocent
until
the
contrary
is
established
by
competent
it
would
require
a
pile
of
evidence
as
high
as
pike
s
peak
to
make
me
believe
that
ingomar
is
a
so
it
would
to
convince
what
have
you
discovered
about
the
mysterious
lady
in
the
black
domino
ah
my
spy
has
met
her
match
there
with
all
her
cleverness
the
black
domino
is
too
much
for
her
one
circumstance
however
has
been
brought
to
the
surface
the
black
domino
is
shadowing
ingomar
too
and
the
strangest
thing
about
it
is
that
she
is
not
in
any
manner
working
with
the
seedy
men
it
s
a
separate
goodness
gracious
what
on
earth
can
it
all
mean
i
m
sure
i
don
t
know
i
wish
i
perhaps
she
is
the
wife
of
the
murdered
man
or
she
may
be
his
sister
or
his
sweetheart
who
is
watching
can
t
say
as
to
that
but
it
is
certain
that
she
is
shadowing
him
one
circumstance
connected
with
her
however
tends
to
prove
your
theory
about
it
the
lady
in
the
black
domino
seems
to
be
unusually
melancholy
all
the
time
has
often
been
seen
weeping
and
never
speaks
to
any
one
that
goes
to
prove
that
she
has
lost
a
dear
friend
or
relative
and
it
may
be
as
you
say
that
she
was
related
to
the
man
who
was
the
truth
is
i
can
t
stand
this
suspense
much
longer
i
shall
die
of
mere
curiosity
if
things
don
t
change
i
beg
you
not
to
make
a
die
of
it
scottie
before
i
get
a
look
at
your
and
pray
why
should
you
wish
to
see
my
face
i
am
sure
i
should
like
suppose
you
did
like
it
what
would
that
signify
it
might
bring
about
a
coincidence
you
look
look
there
comes
the
black
domino
see
how
she
follows
ingomar
i
saw
her
pointing
at
him
just
now
and
whispering
something
in
her
uncle
s
ear
the
whirlwind
is
going
to
burst
on
us
ere
long
don
t
you
think
so
indeed
i
do
there
is
a
strange
game
being
played
on
this
boat
it
may
end
in
a
pray
don
t
talk
that
way
you
frighten
me
i
think
i
had
better
mention
the
matter
to
the
queen
and
have
this
nonsense
ended
at
no
no
don
t
do
that
by
any
means
i
beseech
you
our
best
plan
is
to
remain
silent
and
wait
for
the
be
it
so
then
sir
knight
you
shall
be
my
champion
when
the
war
i
shall
be
proud
of
the
honor
i
ll
emblazon
my
banner
with
the
name
of
scottie
in
letters
of
gold
and
fight
the
world
in
arms
in
defense
of
my
then
i
ll
imitate
the
brave
spanish
king
when
he
met
sir
roderick
dhu
on
clanalpine
s
lofty
height
you
know
he
threw
himself
against
a
rock
which
i
ll
do
when
the
fight
but
there
are
no
rocks
here
you
oh
never
mind
that
i
ll
make
the
answer
for
the
rock
i
ll
just
throw
myself
against
it
while
you
can
hide
inside
and
then
hear
me
cry
come
one
come
all
this
rock
shall
fly
from
its
firm
base
as
soon
as
brave
bravo
my
gallant
knight
i
ll
swap
my
domino
for
a
laurel
crown
to
deck
the
brow
of
my
brave
there
there
scottie
i
cry
enough
come
let
us
join
our
friends
they
are
waiting
for
us
yonder
don
t
you
see
the
queen
is
beckoning
to
you
when
i
received
lottie
s
note
requesting
me
to
come
to
her
immediately
you
may
guess
how
my
heart
fluttered
for
i
thought
something
serious
had
surely
occurred
and
but
very
few
moments
elapsed
before
i
was
at
the
gate
in
front
of
rockland
s
residence
it
was
a
considerable
walk
from
the
to
his
residence
and
i
was
compelled
to
halt
in
order
to
rest
a
moment
before
entering
as
i
wished
to
appear
composed
while
i
was
leaning
against
a
tree
wiping
the
perspiration
from
my
face
and
panting
with
fatigue
i
saw
lottie
coming
rapidly
toward
me
she
had
been
watching
for
me
oh
eddie
it
s
all
settled
she
exclaimed
as
she
caught
both
my
hands
in
hers
i
made
a
move
as
if
i
were
going
to
take
her
in
my
arms
she
gently
pushed
me
back
don
t
be
quite
so
familiar
eddie
can
t
you
see
papa
looking
at
us
oh
such
a
storm
as
we
have
had
here
papa
ordered
me
to
go
away
from
his
home
because
i
wouldn
t
let
him
tell
you
that
i
wanted
our
engagement
broken
well
why
didn
t
you
take
him
at
his
word
you
knew
where
you
could
find
another
i
did
but
the
good
dear
old
darling
relented
before
i
could
pack
my
things
and
fell
to
hugging
and
kissing
me
and
wouldn
t
let
me
lottie
rockland
is
really
a
good
man
and
i
respect
him
very
much
mainly
because
he
loves
indeed
he
is
and
my
heart
was
most
broken
when
he
ordered
me
to
go
away
but
did
you
wish
to
have
our
engagement
broken
off
no
you
know
i
did
not
what
could
have
put
such
an
idea
as
that
into
your
mind
rockland
did
not
tell
you
i
wished
it
ended
did
he
he
didn
t
say
that
you
said
so
but
he
said
you
were
willing
to
cancel
it
if
i
would
consent
to
ah
i
see
now
how
it
is
rockland
put
the
case
very
strong
in
favor
of
his
side
that
was
a
good
stroke
of
policy
you
see
lottie
you
didn
t
believe
for
a
moment
that
i
wanted
to
have
the
engagement
canceled
no
i
did
i
declare
lottie
i
never
saw
you
look
so
pretty
i
am
truly
glad
that
you
think
so
it
makes
me
very
happy
to
please
ah
how
could
i
be
otherwise
than
well
pleased
when
i
know
lottie
loves
me
i
feel
like
a
new
man
since
i
found
it
out
will
my
lottie
always
love
me
yes
of
course
i
will
i
am
so
very
very
happy
when
you
are
with
me
and
so
miserable
when
you
are
away
from
me
what
shall
become
of
poor
me
when
my
eddie
goes
away
to
philadelphia
let
us
look
forward
to
the
happy
day
that
brings
me
back
to
my
love
let
us
keep
our
minds
on
the
bright
future
when
we
shall
be
always
i
wish
i
could
do
that
but
i
can
not
i
shall
all
the
time
be
thinking
you
are
ill
or
that
something
has
gone
wrong
with
you
i
should
die
if
you
were
to
fall
ill
among
strangers
i
ll
take
good
care
of
myself
for
your
sake
i
ll
be
prudent
in
all
things
and
let
you
know
if
anything
goes
wrong
but
you
must
do
the
let
us
go
in
i
see
rockland
waiting
for
you
he
is
going
to
talk
to
you
about
our
engagement
and
you
must
be
careful
not
to
offend
fear
nothing
on
that
score
i
think
we
will
now
come
to
an
understanding
entirely
satisfactory
to
all
parties
mr
rockland
met
me
on
the
portico
with
his
cold
placid
smile
and
directed
me
to
follow
him
into
the
library
he
also
asked
lottie
to
go
with
us
pointing
to
a
seat
he
requested
me
to
take
it
lottie
stood
calmly
by
my
chair
while
rockland
took
his
usual
seat
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
mr
demar
he
began
with
his
austere
tone
of
voice
i
have
had
an
interview
with
lottie
on
the
subject
about
which
we
were
speaking
a
short
while
so
lottie
told
me
her
views
and
mine
differed
somewhat
but
we
have
managed
to
reconcile
them
to
some
extent
and
we
may
therefore
reasonably
hope
to
have
all
things
amicably
i
am
truly
glad
to
hear
it
thank
you
edward
are
you
willing
to
promise
me
that
the
marriage
shall
be
deferred
until
the
end
of
two
years
from
this
date
indeed
rockland
i
should
like
very
much
to
be
able
to
comply
with
your
request
but
why
not
let
the
marriage
be
solemnized
when
i
return
from
philadelphia
in
the
spring
lottie
would
be
too
young
to
marry
grant
papa
s
request
eddie
said
lottie
i
am
very
willing
to
put
it
off
indefinitely
if
you
can
be
with
me
that
settled
the
question
so
it
was
agreed
that
lottie
should
be
my
wife
at
the
end
of
two
years
come
said
lottie
as
she
took
my
arm
and
looking
up
at
me
her
sweet
little
mouth
puckered
up
in
a
comical
shape
we
ll
go
to
the
study
now
as
everything
has
been
settled
between
you
and
papa
i
want
to
show
you
some
new
flowers
that
i
have
secured
oh
they
are
such
nice
ones
they
flourish
better
in
the
fall
season
than
they
do
in
the
she
led
me
through
her
flower
garden
stopping
occasionally
to
point
out
the
different
plants
giving
a
graphic
description
of
their
nature
and
the
manner
of
their
culture
and
when
we
came
near
the
the
old
parrot
began
to
chatter
ah
ha
lottie
here
we
come
here
we
come
can
t
he
say
anything
but
that
lottie
i
inquired
oh
yes
he
can
talk
a
great
deal
when
he
takes
a
notion
did
you
know
i
had
a
letter
from
viola
eddie
no
have
you
yes
let
me
read
it
to
you
she
writes
such
a
nice
smooth
hand
and
her
letter
is
so
friendly
but
here
it
is
new
york
dear
lottie
i
must
first
offer
an
apology
to
you
for
neglecting
to
answer
your
last
letter
you
must
not
for
a
moment
think
that
the
delay
was
caused
by
a
lack
of
love
for
you
on
my
part
when
your
letter
came
i
had
not
returned
from
my
boarding
school
but
as
soon
as
i
came
home
and
found
your
darling
letter
i
lost
no
time
in
answering
it
oh
lottie
i
am
so
happy
just
now
that
i
can
not
find
words
to
tell
you
as
i
should
like
to
do
papa
has
consented
to
let
me
spend
the
winter
in
memphis
and
you
may
look
for
me
by
the
last
of
september
oh
isn
t
that
delightful
won
t
we
have
lots
of
fun
i
often
think
of
you
and
your
heroic
little
brother
but
i
ought
not
to
speak
of
him
as
your
little
brother
now
i
suppose
because
he
must
be
a
man
by
this
time
i
have
his
picture
you
know
lottie
and
oh
how
much
i
do
think
of
it
i
keep
it
next
to
my
heart
all
the
time
all
the
gold
in
california
could
not
buy
it
from
me
i
expect
harry
has
changed
very
much
since
we
parted
you
know
i
was
only
a
little
child
then
but
now
i
am
a
great
overgrown
mushroom
and
as
green
as
a
gourd
dear
papa
says
i
am
pretty
but
you
know
evidence
of
that
kind
is
unreliable
still
i
confess
i
should
like
to
know
it
was
true
you
may
tell
harry
i
suppose
i
ought
to
say
wallingford
that
i
have
not
forgotten
him
and
i
don
t
think
i
ever
shall
i
was
so
glad
to
hear
that
he
was
going
to
make
a
great
lawyer
of
himself
rockland
says
in
his
letters
to
papa
that
wallingford
possesses
great
talent
and
will
be
sure
to
distinguish
himself
some
day
would
you
believe
it
i
shed
lots
of
joyful
tears
when
papa
read
the
letter
to
me
i
envy
you
how
happy
you
must
be
how
proud
of
such
a
brave
heroic
talented
brother
you
see
i
am
well
posted
in
everything
that
concerns
you
and
your
noble
brother
i
often
wonder
if
he
ever
thinks
of
the
little
foolish
girl
he
kept
from
being
crushed
to
death
by
the
engine
i
wonder
if
he
has
forgotten
how
he
and
i
went
rolling
and
tumbling
down
the
embankment
together
i
was
so
much
delighted
at
your
description
of
your
flower
garden
i
know
i
shall
enjoy
it
very
much
you
people
of
the
dear
sunny
south
have
great
advantages
over
us
in
that
respect
i
think
i
should
like
to
live
in
the
south
all
the
time
i
suppose
you
knew
i
had
a
darling
little
brother
yes
i
know
you
did
because
i
remember
now
that
i
told
you
of
it
in
my
other
letters
poor
little
fellow
he
is
not
a
healthy
child
at
all
he
is
now
nearly
five
years
old
and
looks
like
a
mere
baby
though
papa
says
he
will
come
out
all
right
after
a
while
did
i
ever
tell
you
what
his
name
was
i
don
t
think
i
did
well
you
see
mamma
and
papa
couldn
t
agree
on
a
name
for
him
and
to
keep
peace
in
the
family
it
was
agreed
that
i
should
have
the
honor
of
selecting
his
name
what
do
you
think
i
did
i
named
him
after
your
heroic
brother
we
call
him
wallie
that
you
know
is
an
abbreviation
of
wallingford
he
was
baptized
as
harry
wallingford
bramlett
and
papa
and
mamma
were
both
delighted
with
the
good
selection
i
made
but
i
must
close
now
because
i
fear
i
have
made
this
letter
too
long
anyway
present
my
highest
regards
to
your
brother
and
accept
my
best
truest
love
for
yourself
and
write
soon
to
your
true
friend
that
s
a
splendid
letter
lottie
for
a
girl
of
sixteen
to
write
said
i
when
it
was
read
through
she
is
not
quite
sixteen
yet
either
said
lottie
that
document
conveys
the
best
news
my
darling
that
i
have
heard
since
you
told
me
you
would
be
to
what
part
of
it
do
you
refer
that
wherein
she
says
she
is
going
to
spend
the
winter
with
you
it
will
be
a
great
consolation
for
me
to
know
when
i
am
so
far
from
you
that
you
will
have
such
a
sweet
friend
for
a
companion
i
was
thinking
of
the
long
dreary
winter
days
and
nights
that
you
would
be
compelled
to
pass
through
all
alone
but
now
how
could
you
be
lonely
with
such
a
lively
little
cricket
as
viola
i
dare
say
she
will
prove
a
great
comfort
to
me
yet
she
can
not
fill
the
aching
void
that
will
be
caused
by
your
as
she
said
this
her
large
dreamy
eyes
were
glancing
up
at
me
while
a
tear
trembled
in
each
and
i
drew
her
head
against
my
breast
too
happy
to
speak
i
led
her
to
a
seat
letting
her
fair
cheek
remain
resting
on
my
heart
while
my
mind
went
straying
into
the
future
a
thousand
thoughts
of
various
kinds
intruded
on
me
some
pleasant
others
very
different
what
if
rockland
should
resort
to
strategy
during
my
absence
to
entrap
my
lottie
into
a
marriage
with
heartsell
what
if
he
should
throw
his
great
intellect
with
his
vast
wealth
and
influence
into
the
balance
against
me
would
my
lottie
be
able
to
withstand
it
would
she
be
able
to
do
battle
successfully
against
such
odds
these
unwelcome
questions
forced
themselves
upon
me
causing
a
shudder
to
dart
through
my
body
lottie
felt
the
shock
and
exclaimed
what
s
the
matter
why
do
you
tremble
so
i
declare
your
heart
made
a
violent
jump
just
now
then
began
to
flutter
and
knock
against
your
breast
what
does
it
mean
i
was
thinking
how
i
should
feel
if
you
were
to
cease
loving
me
when
i
went
away
and
should
marry
heartsell
she
started
up
looking
at
me
reproachfully
how
can
you
talk
so
didn
t
you
know
i
had
rejected
heartsell
s
offer
indeed
i
did
not
i
was
not
aware
of
the
fact
that
he
had
made
it
though
i
knew
he
intended
to
do
well
he
has
done
it
and
you
may
be
easy
tell
me
what
he
said
and
what
you
mr
heartsell
i
think
is
a
very
nice
good
man
and
worthy
of
a
true
woman
s
love
but
i
had
no
heart
for
him
because
you
like
a
good
old
thief
went
and
stole
it
i
felt
highly
honored
by
heartsell
s
partiality
and
told
him
so
but
i
thought
it
my
duty
to
tell
him
the
truth
at
once
which
i
did
i
told
him
my
hand
and
heart
belonged
to
another
poor
fellow
he
wept
when
i
told
him
i
loved
another
and
could
not
love
him
he
said
he
would
not
give
me
up
but
would
wait
until
i
should
think
better
of
him
and
he
seemed
to
think
that
i
would
change
my
mind
and
love
him
after
all
but
don
t
you
know
that
i
can
never
change
i
can
t
express
my
admiration
lottie
for
your
extraordinary
prudence
not
one
girl
in
a
hundred
would
have
taken
the
proper
view
in
such
an
emergency
of
course
you
did
right
to
tell
heartsell
the
whole
truth
most
girls
under
similar
circumstances
would
have
evaded
the
truth
and
left
the
man
a
reasonable
by
the
by
have
you
ever
mentioned
our
engagement
to
brother
harry
oh
yes
i
named
it
to
him
before
i
did
to
any
one
and
what
did
he
think
of
it
he
was
glad
of
it
said
it
was
just
what
he
expected
and
desired
congratulated
me
heartily
said
i
was
a
lucky
fellow
to
be
the
winner
of
such
a
heart
said
he
knew
you
loved
me
all
the
time
told
me
that
if
ever
i
caused
you
trouble
he
would
kill
me
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
lottie
i
believe
he
would
kill
any
one
who
would
bring
trouble
on
oh
he
is
such
a
noble
generous
heroic
brother
viola
loves
him
and
i
hope
they
will
make
a
match
of
ah
lottie
that
will
never
may
i
know
the
reason
why
you
think
so
viola
is
a
great
heiress
and
you
know
how
proud
harry
is
no
matter
how
much
he
might
love
her
he
would
never
tell
her
of
it
do
you
know
that
i
think
the
only
fault
harry
has
is
his
unprecedented
pride
i
have
been
acquainted
with
many
proud
men
but
there
is
something
in
harry
s
pride
that
places
it
beyond
anything
i
ever
have
witnessed
in
other
people
no
lottie
let
me
advise
you
not
to
build
your
pyramid
of
hopes
on
a
foundation
of
that
is
bramlett
very
wealthy
mr
rockland
tells
me
that
he
is
a
millionaire
and
you
know
he
has
only
two
then
i
must
confess
that
i
don
t
think
harry
would
be
doing
exactly
right
were
he
to
seek
viola
s
hand
in
marriage
if
that
s
what
you
refer
to
when
you
speak
of
his
pride
i
am
fully
prepared
to
indorse
the
dreadful
day
for
my
departure
had
come
at
last
the
awful
moment
in
which
i
was
to
part
from
lottie
had
come
and
gone
the
parting
words
had
been
uttered
the
bitter
tears
had
been
shed
the
farewell
kiss
given
the
long
loving
embrace
was
over
i
had
handed
dear
lottie
fainting
into
rockland
s
arms
and
was
on
my
way
to
chapter
xii
i
arrived
in
new
york
city
in
due
time
and
set
about
the
work
which
doctor
dodson
had
charged
me
with
when
i
reached
philadelphia
i
found
a
long
letter
from
lottie
here
it
is
dear
eddie
your
letter
was
received
yesterday
and
if
you
knew
how
happy
it
made
me
you
would
write
me
one
every
day
i
have
read
it
through
at
least
a
dozen
times
and
every
dear
expression
is
engraved
on
my
heart
i
beseech
you
to
take
good
care
of
yourself
and
you
must
be
sure
to
tell
me
if
you
ever
feel
the
least
ill
but
lest
i
should
bore
you
with
so
much
talk
about
love
matters
i
will
tell
you
something
about
viola
she
has
been
with
me
nearly
three
weeks
and
is
the
sweetest
prettiest
little
cricket
that
any
one
ever
looked
upon
not
so
little
however
as
you
might
think
for
she
is
as
tall
as
i
am
she
has
a
most
charming
disposition
as
gentle
as
a
dove
and
can
sing
oh
so
sweetly
it
would
make
you
weep
to
hear
her
play
on
the
guitar
while
singing
one
of
her
plaintive
songs
she
is
complete
mistress
of
the
piano
and
guitar
i
had
been
flattering
myself
that
i
was
a
pretty
good
musician
but
when
i
heard
viola
play
my
conceit
oozed
out
she
is
in
love
with
harry
but
just
as
i
expected
he
is
too
proud
to
let
her
know
how
he
loves
her
he
maintains
a
dignified
stiffness
of
manner
when
with
her
that
chills
me
to
the
heart
and
frightens
her
i
wonder
if
this
hateful
money
of
bramlett
s
is
going
to
break
these
two
young
loving
hearts
viola
has
harry
s
picture
wears
it
in
her
bosom
all
the
time
i
saw
her
kissing
it
the
other
day
and
crying
over
it
when
she
thought
no
one
was
near
what
a
darling
little
wife
she
would
make
for
harry
if
he
would
only
ask
her
i
wish
i
had
a
gold
mine
so
i
could
give
it
to
him
and
make
his
fortune
equal
to
hers
i
believe
he
loves
her
fervently
and
would
tell
her
so
but
for
the
hateful
gulf
that
bramlett
s
gold
has
placed
between
them
i
fear
that
much
sorrow
is
in
store
for
both
of
them
but
let
us
hope
for
the
best
viola
and
i
are
rooming
together
poor
old
bob
dozes
on
the
hearth
in
my
room
all
the
time
since
the
weather
got
too
cold
for
him
to
stay
in
his
house
he
has
quit
quarreling
with
old
roderick
and
they
have
become
very
good
friends
now
the
parrot
comes
up
to
my
room
every
night
and
takes
his
snooze
in
the
closet
he
has
learned
to
speak
several
new
words
since
you
went
away
it
would
amuse
you
to
hear
him
try
to
say
philadelphia
but
he
can
t
do
it
the
word
is
too
big
for
him
i
was
trying
to
teach
him
to
tell
where
you
were
living
and
when
he
failed
to
say
philadelphia
we
compromised
on
new
york
because
he
can
say
that
as
plainly
as
i
can
mr
heartsell
has
called
on
me
several
times
since
you
left
poor
fellow
he
looks
so
sad
he
treats
me
with
such
tender
consideration
never
mentions
the
subject
i
suppose
he
has
given
up
all
hope
in
that
direction
i
can
t
help
having
the
very
highest
respect
for
him
but
do
not
become
jealous
for
i
don
t
love
him
the
least
bit
how
could
i
love
any
one
else
when
my
eddie
has
taken
my
heart
away
with
him
i
think
poor
old
bob
will
die
before
you
come
home
he
is
very
old
you
know
i
never
let
him
want
for
anything
how
could
i
as
i
think
of
the
time
when
we
were
poor
homeless
tramps
do
you
ever
let
your
mind
wander
back
to
those
old
days
when
we
were
all
tramps
have
you
forgotten
the
cloth
shoes
you
made
for
me
while
you
were
convalescing
at
holly
s
farmhouse
i
have
got
those
old
shoes
yet
i
am
preserving
them
as
relics
of
the
happy
days
of
old
papa
says
that
he
will
have
to
mortgage
his
estate
to
buy
postage
stamps
if
i
don
t
quit
writing
so
many
long
letters
to
you
i
don
t
care
if
he
does
i
mean
to
write
a
long
letter
every
day
the
autumn
weather
has
been
delightful
and
you
may
guess
viola
and
i
have
made
good
use
of
it
she
is
the
liveliest
girl
i
ever
saw
always
mirthful
and
happy
except
when
harry
gets
on
his
high
horse
of
pride
then
a
shade
of
melancholy
chases
away
the
jolly
look
alas
what
misery
will
ensue
if
harry
does
not
conquer
this
strange
mysterious
passion
called
pride
poor
girl
she
does
not
know
that
it
is
the
hateful
money
that
keeps
harry
and
her
so
far
apart
harry
is
not
happy
as
he
was
before
viola
came
and
i
begin
to
see
a
cloud
of
sorrow
rising
in
the
distance
which
is
sure
to
burst
over
their
heads
unless
something
intervenes
to
prevent
it
oh
love
love
love
what
a
wonderful
thing
thou
art
how
much
happiness
canst
thou
give
when
circumstances
are
favorable
and
what
misery
when
unfavorable
when
i
think
of
what
exquisite
delight
your
love
has
given
me
i
can
t
realize
the
fact
that
the
same
kind
of
passion
has
caused
so
much
misery
to
others
i
am
so
selfish
in
my
love
yet
so
happy
but
then
when
i
think
of
the
many
long
dreary
days
that
must
elapse
before
i
shall
see
you
i
am
in
despair
i
sometimes
imagine
that
i
should
like
to
fall
into
a
trance
and
not
wake
up
till
you
return
the
old
clock
on
the
mantel
goes
on
ticking
away
deliberately
while
an
age
seems
to
intervene
between
the
strokes
oh
how
can
i
wait
so
long
before
i
shall
look
again
in
those
dear
eyes
your
eyes
always
looked
so
tenderly
down
into
mine
i
could
read
your
thoughts
when
gazing
in
your
eyes
you
were
always
so
tender
and
gentle
with
me
in
the
good
old
days
when
my
feet
were
bleeding
from
their
many
wounds
i
remember
you
lifted
me
in
your
arms
when
i
was
unable
to
walk
and
carried
me
to
the
banks
of
the
little
brook
and
bathed
my
feet
so
tenderly
do
you
never
let
your
mind
recall
those
happy
days
i
call
them
happy
days
though
they
were
not
unmixed
with
sadness
but
those
were
the
days
in
which
you
won
my
heart
do
you
remember
the
evening
when
old
bob
came
to
our
camp
looking
so
poor
and
miserable
what
a
lucky
thing
it
was
he
happened
to
take
it
into
his
head
to
follow
me
but
you
will
be
laughing
at
me
when
you
read
this
nonsense
well
do
you
know
darling
i
don
t
care
how
much
you
laugh
at
me
i
rather
like
it
when
i
know
you
love
me
so
well
viola
is
looking
over
my
shoulder
just
now
telling
me
to
give
you
her
highest
regards
and
i
imagine
it
makes
her
sad
to
know
that
my
love
is
returned
while
she
thinks
hers
for
harry
is
not
harry
says
he
wishes
to
be
kindly
remembered
by
you
he
thinks
you
are
the
best
fellow
in
the
world
shows
his
good
sense
don
t
it
darling
well
i
suppose
when
you
read
this
long
letter
you
will
be
tired
but
i
could
write
all
day
to
you
and
never
tire
i
could
write
a
volume
about
love
and
then
not
have
space
sufficient
to
describe
all
i
feel
for
my
darling
but
i
reckon
i
had
better
halt
here
and
don
t
forget
the
kisses
i
have
sent
in
this
letter
your
faithful
loving
i
often
think
that
men
who
never
loved
are
not
capable
of
understanding
the
wonderful
mystery
because
they
are
often
heard
to
speak
of
it
as
simple
nonsense
a
foolish
weakness
only
known
to
weak
minds
i
have
been
told
that
many
a
man
has
lived
a
long
life
and
died
without
ever
having
felt
the
charming
influence
of
true
love
if
they
did
they
died
in
ignorance
of
what
real
happiness
was
to
say
that
i
read
lottie
s
sweet
letter
a
thousand
times
would
perhaps
be
an
exaggeration
to
say
i
only
read
it
once
would
be
short
of
the
mark
i
read
it
a
great
many
times
but
i
must
hasten
on
and
not
consume
your
time
with
too
much
talk
about
my
dear
lottie
as
i
shall
have
many
thrilling
events
to
describe
events
that
occurred
after
i
had
finished
my
attendance
at
the
lectures
i
will
however
ask
permission
to
read
one
of
my
letters
to
lottie
after
which
i
promise
to
hasten
on
to
the
stirring
events
which
really
constitute
the
gist
of
this
story
dear
lottie
your
highly
appreciated
letter
was
here
when
i
arrived
and
were
i
to
exhaust
webster
s
unabridged
i
am
sure
i
could
find
no
words
adequate
to
describe
the
pleasure
i
felt
while
perusing
it
you
inquired
if
i
ever
let
my
mind
wander
back
to
the
old
days
when
we
were
homeless
tramps
ah
yes
lottie
my
mind
has
traveled
a
thousand
times
over
every
path
where
your
dear
feet
have
trod
i
can
call
to
mind
every
little
trifling
circumstance
that
was
in
any
manner
connected
with
you
i
have
seen
nothing
in
the
shape
of
a
woman
that
can
begin
to
compare
with
my
lottie
i
am
stopping
at
the
girard
house
on
chestnut
street
have
comfortable
quarters
on
the
second
floor
fronting
the
street
that
is
one
of
the
most
beautiful
streets
in
the
city
every
evening
it
is
crowded
with
splendid
equipages
and
handsome
ladies
but
none
so
beautiful
as
my
lottie
independence
hall
is
situated
on
this
street
i
spent
one
whole
day
looking
at
the
quaint
old
relics
that
are
to
be
seen
there
the
old
bell
whose
brazen
tongue
proclaimed
the
birth
of
a
new
nation
nearly
a
hundred
years
ago
is
there
still
the
heavy
old
carved
chairs
that
were
used
by
the
members
of
the
continental
congress
may
be
seen
in
the
very
places
where
they
stood
when
occupied
by
those
heroic
old
patriots
a
portrait
of
george
iii
hangs
on
the
wall
his
youthful
features
have
no
expression
that
would
indicate
the
tyrant
the
old
pistols
used
by
lafayette
during
the
war
of
independence
are
great
curiosities
in
themselves
washington
s
may
be
seen
with
the
cooking
utensils
used
while
commanding
the
american
army
all
put
together
would
scarcely
weigh
fifty
pounds
a
common
lieutenant
of
the
present
day
would
tender
his
resignation
if
he
were
required
to
reduce
the
bulk
of
his
camp
equipage
to
that
used
by
the
in
this
is
a
fast
age
you
know
and
ideas
have
changed
since
the
honest
days
of
old
strange
reflections
crowded
on
my
mind
as
i
gazed
on
those
dear
old
relics
where
are
all
those
brave
old
soldiers
now
where
are
all
the
heroic
men
and
beautiful
women
who
inhabited
this
continent
then
all
dead
all
gone
perhaps
not
a
living
soul
can
now
be
found
on
the
earth
who
heard
the
old
bell
proclaim
the
notes
of
liberty
to
the
people
in
philadelphia
is
a
beautiful
city
so
clean
so
quiet
so
charming
everything
so
systematic
i
think
i
should
like
to
live
here
but
for
the
severely
cold
winters
i
visited
girard
college
the
other
day
and
would
you
believe
it
lottie
a
man
at
the
gate
asked
me
if
i
was
a
preacher
now
don
t
i
look
like
a
preacher
have
you
ever
imagined
that
i
in
any
manner
resembled
one
of
course
not
yet
he
did
ask
me
the
strange
question
i
of
course
answered
promptly
no
and
then
he
allowed
me
to
go
in
my
curiosity
was
roused
and
i
didn
t
stop
till
i
learned
the
reasons
why
the
question
was
put
to
me
girard
inserted
a
clause
in
his
will
that
no
minister
of
the
gospel
should
ever
be
permitted
to
enter
the
inclosure
there
are
many
things
to
amuse
and
instruct
one
in
this
sober
old
city
and
i
mean
to
give
you
a
more
elaborate
history
of
them
in
my
next
letter
i
don
t
think
i
ever
shall
make
a
very
great
surgeon
because
the
dissecting
room
is
a
very
unpleasant
place
to
me
when
engaged
in
it
i
can
t
for
the
life
of
me
keep
my
mind
on
the
business
before
me
but
in
spite
of
me
it
will
go
straying
off
into
the
realms
of
philosophy
the
first
time
i
entered
the
dissecting
room
i
felt
unusually
sad
the
subject
was
a
young
man
of
powerful
frame
limbs
brawny
chest
and
handsome
face
whom
i
supposed
to
be
about
my
own
age
a
feeling
of
horror
thrilled
through
my
whole
frame
as
i
saw
the
sharp
glittering
steel
inserted
in
his
white
flesh
i
then
and
there
became
convinced
that
i
never
should
master
the
science
of
surgery
if
that
was
the
only
way
it
could
be
done
when
the
dead
man
s
brain
and
heart
were
taken
out
i
took
the
heart
in
my
left
hand
and
the
brain
in
the
other
seated
myself
as
far
away
as
i
could
without
leaving
the
room
and
began
to
philosophize
in
a
most
singular
manner
what
is
this
little
dark
red
lump
of
flesh
that
i
hold
in
my
left
hand
answer
the
human
heart
the
supposed
seat
of
life
the
little
governor
that
regulates
the
quantity
of
blood
that
each
tiny
vein
is
entitled
to
as
its
share
this
little
lump
of
flesh
puts
all
the
small
pumps
in
motion
that
move
the
red
life
through
the
human
body
this
little
insignificant
thing
is
the
great
throne
where
love
holds
his
court
where
all
the
passions
assemble
round
to
pay
homage
to
the
king
of
love
in
what
corner
of
this
little
ball
does
love
hold
his
court
where
is
the
identical
spot
how
is
it
we
can
feel
it
and
not
see
it
how
can
so
much
delicious
joy
find
room
in
this
little
bulk
how
can
it
produce
such
heavenly
joys
such
ecstatic
bliss
as
i
feel
in
my
love
for
my
lottie
then
again
how
can
so
small
a
bulk
suffer
such
untold
indescribable
torture
as
we
endure
when
we
love
some
beautiful
object
who
returns
scorn
for
true
love
as
i
held
the
heart
in
my
hand
i
thought
of
shakespeare
s
wonderful
creations
of
beauty
and
asked
myself
the
question
was
his
great
heart
like
this
how
could
a
man
possessing
a
little
heart
like
this
compose
such
poetry
then
i
thought
perhaps
it
was
the
brain
where
all
those
beautiful
things
originated
and
i
turned
my
attention
to
it
what
was
it
nothing
but
a
few
ounces
of
soft
fatty
substance
is
this
the
great
spring
from
whence
such
brilliant
ideas
flow
was
the
great
bard
of
avon
s
brain
like
this
how
could
such
an
insignificant
mess
of
fat
give
life
to
such
sentiment
such
inspiration
was
this
little
gob
of
fat
all
that
napoleon
had
to
depend
on
to
enable
him
to
overturn
kingdoms
and
to
make
kings
out
of
peasants
did
alexander
and
cæsar
have
brains
like
this
did
byron
s
base
of
thought
depend
on
such
a
slender
foundation
as
this
the
more
questions
i
propounded
to
myself
on
the
subject
the
more
i
became
bewildered
scientists
assert
that
the
brain
is
the
dome
of
thought
but
if
it
is
so
i
must
say
that
the
dome
of
thought
is
a
very
insignificant
dome
no
it
is
the
soul
that
dwells
in
the
head
sitting
back
on
its
throne
that
directs
and
moves
everything
it
is
not
dependent
on
this
little
lump
of
fat
for
its
existence
nor
is
it
in
any
manner
indebted
to
it
for
the
thoughts
that
man
produces
the
soul
sits
on
a
throne
in
a
man
s
hand
and
issues
orders
like
a
king
from
his
earthly
throne
all
parts
of
the
body
are
moved
by
orders
from
the
soul
just
as
great
armies
are
moved
by
orders
of
the
king
when
the
body
falls
into
decay
the
soul
steps
out
uninjured
and
reports
to
its
creator
for
duty
who
made
this
incomprehensible
thing
called
a
soul
god
who
made
stop
right
here
and
seek
to
know
no
more
trust
everything
to
that
mysterious
power
who
created
this
admirable
machine
called
man
what
are
you
doing
demar
inquired
the
professor
you
have
been
looking
at
those
little
organs
a
long
time
what
have
you
discovered
enough
to
convince
me
that
man
is
a
poor
helpless
ignorant
thing
unable
to
tell
anything
about
his
own
i
then
took
a
sharp
knife
and
began
to
dissect
the
heart
i
cut
it
into
a
hundred
little
slices
looking
with
all
the
eyes
i
had
to
see
where
love
resided
but
my
search
was
in
vain
was
my
lottie
s
heart
like
this
was
my
own
heart
like
it
if
so
why
could
i
find
nothing
that
would
indicate
the
part
where
love
dwelt
i
knew
from
the
feelings
of
my
own
heart
that
love
dwelt
there
but
with
all
my
surgery
i
could
not
find
it
i
was
so
nervous
i
did
not
sleep
a
wink
that
night
and
i
think
i
shall
not
attempt
to
pry
into
the
secrets
of
nature
any
more
when
i
know
that
my
lottie
loves
me
dearly
and
that
i
adore
her
beyond
everything
on
earth
that
is
enough
for
me
and
i
shall
not
again
attempt
to
investigate
secrets
which
god
never
intended
weak
mortals
to
know
i
am
happy
oh
so
very
happy
no
matter
how
or
wherefore
i
am
happy
and
that
s
sufficient
i
was
exceedingly
sorry
to
hear
that
harry
still
clings
to
his
absurd
notions
of
pride
it
will
kill
all
pleasure
destroy
all
hopes
of
happiness
unless
he
discards
it
why
should
he
reject
the
love
of
such
a
charming
woman
when
it
would
make
him
the
happiest
man
in
memphis
if
he
would
lay
aside
his
foolish
pride
i
fully
concur
with
you
in
the
idea
that
his
conduct
is
going
to
produce
unspeakable
sorrow
i
knew
that
viola
loved
him
when
she
was
a
mere
child
and
she
is
worthy
of
any
man
s
love
use
all
your
powers
of
persuasion
my
dear
lottie
on
him
see
if
you
can
not
convince
him
of
his
error
i
know
he
loves
you
dearly
and
has
a
high
opinion
of
your
judgment
and
i
trust
you
may
be
able
to
induce
him
to
change
his
mind
i
am
sorry
to
be
compelled
however
to
tell
you
that
the
reports
you
have
heard
regarding
bramlett
s
wealth
have
not
been
at
all
exaggerated
his
estate
is
estimated
at
ten
to
fifteen
hundred
thousand
dollars
i
was
invited
to
dine
with
him
during
my
stay
in
new
york
i
accepted
the
invitation
and
was
delighted
with
the
entertainment
the
dinner
party
consisted
of
a
dozen
invited
guests
besides
the
family
all
persons
of
distinction
except
myself
of
course
one
one
united
states
senator
one
and
two
railway
presidents
the
others
were
newspaper
men
and
bankers
and
two
literary
ladies
bramlett
knowing
how
green
i
was
in
such
matters
took
charge
of
me
at
the
start
and
piloted
me
through
so
skillfully
that
i
was
not
at
all
embarrassed
to
describe
the
grand
display
of
wealth
that
met
my
eyes
would
be
indeed
a
difficult
task
bramlett
made
a
great
many
inquiries
about
harry
so
did
bramlett
they
both
seem
to
think
a
great
deal
of
him
and
no
doubt
would
readily
consent
for
viola
to
marry
him
bramlett
is
by
no
means
a
gold
worshiper
he
has
made
his
fortune
by
energetic
work
and
close
attention
to
business
is
very
liberal
with
his
money
and
exceedingly
popular
with
the
business
men
of
new
york
bramlett
is
a
confirmed
invalid
though
she
is
one
of
the
best
little
women
i
ever
knew
but
dear
lottie
i
must
not
undertake
to
tell
everything
in
one
letter
but
will
reserve
something
to
be
said
in
my
next
having
kissed
this
paper
a
hundred
times
for
you
i
now
bid
my
darling
angel
good
night
yours
forever
and
ever
i
had
been
in
philadelphia
but
a
short
time
when
the
news
of
bramlett
s
death
reached
me
and
lottie
informed
me
by
letter
that
viola
was
overwhelmed
with
grief
at
the
loss
of
her
father
and
that
she
had
immediately
started
home
accompanied
by
harry
i
was
glad
to
learn
that
harry
had
gone
home
with
her
for
i
still
clung
to
the
idea
that
viola
would
yet
be
his
wife
i
was
satisfied
that
she
soon
would
be
left
all
alone
for
her
mother
s
health
was
wretched
and
it
was
certain
she
would
not
long
survive
her
husband
i
received
a
letter
from
harry
soon
after
his
arrival
in
new
york
and
as
it
has
an
intimate
connection
with
this
narrative
i
think
i
had
better
read
it
now
dear
edward
i
presume
you
have
heard
of
the
death
of
bramlett
as
sister
lottie
promised
to
give
you
the
information
his
death
has
cast
a
cloud
over
viola
s
young
life
she
loved
her
father
devotedly
and
is
plunged
in
despair
at
his
sudden
death
misfortunes
it
seems
never
visit
us
singly
but
most
always
come
crowding
on
us
in
platoons
bramlett
is
dying
now
we
don
t
think
she
will
last
more
than
hours
longer
poor
viola
i
pity
her
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
i
am
so
glad
i
consented
to
accompany
her
home
and
that
i
can
be
with
her
during
this
awful
affliction
she
is
the
most
amiable
charming
girl
i
ever
knew
the
sweetest
disposition
the
gentlest
manners
and
i
believe
i
might
say
the
most
beautiful
too
i
will
tell
you
a
great
secret
if
you
will
keep
it
to
yourself
i
am
desperately
in
love
with
viola
nay
to
tell
you
the
whole
truth
i
adore
her
and
my
love
is
returned
without
discount
i
might
say
with
a
good
interest
but
alas
i
can
never
marry
her
you
know
there
is
an
impassable
gulf
that
separates
us
i
should
despise
myself
if
i
thought
that
i
was
a
sneaking
i
would
look
upon
myself
as
a
disgraced
unworthy
mean
fellow
and
so
would
everybody
else
were
i
to
take
advantage
of
that
poor
girl
s
situation
mr
bramlett
made
a
will
placing
all
his
property
in
the
hands
of
trustees
to
be
divided
equally
between
viola
and
her
brother
harry
both
to
have
control
of
their
respective
shares
on
arriving
at
the
age
of
years
bramlett
was
amply
provided
for
under
the
will
but
she
will
not
live
to
enjoy
the
benefits
of
her
husband
s
generosity
stanley
ragland
a
of
bramlett
s
is
named
in
the
will
as
guardian
to
viola
and
her
brother
ragland
resides
in
memphis
a
lawyer
though
i
don
t
think
he
is
engaged
in
the
practice
of
his
profession
now
i
am
glad
to
know
that
viola
is
to
reside
permanently
in
memphis
it
will
be
a
consolation
to
see
her
now
and
then
even
if
she
is
to
be
some
other
man
s
wife
i
never
shall
see
another
happy
moment
after
the
day
that
viola
is
wedded
and
as
a
matter
of
course
she
will
not
remain
single
long
memphis
will
swarm
with
unscrupulous
as
soon
as
viola
arrives
and
it
becomes
known
that
she
is
an
heiress
to
a
great
fortune
i
shall
remain
here
until
after
bramlett
s
funeral
for
the
purpose
of
accompanying
viola
and
her
brother
to
memphis
as
i
have
already
said
the
poor
woman
can
not
possibly
survive
more
than
two
days
longer
viola
s
grief
is
crushing
her
young
heart
and
i
think
it
best
to
take
her
away
from
here
as
soon
as
possible
her
brother
is
a
handsome
boy
and
i
think
i
shall
like
him
very
much
he
is
a
bright
lively
little
fellow
and
has
become
very
much
attached
to
me
i
am
proud
to
have
such
a
boy
named
after
me
that
you
know
was
done
by
viola
which
you
perceive
is
another
evidence
of
her
affection
for
me
i
shall
be
glad
to
hear
from
you
as
soon
as
i
get
home
and
shall
expect
you
to
write
often
poor
lottie
she
hated
so
much
to
part
with
viola
they
had
become
true
friends
loved
each
other
fervently
she
will
be
quite
lonely
until
we
get
home
i
have
extended
this
communication
much
longer
than
i
intended
and
must
apologize
to
you
for
it
with
many
wishes
for
your
good
health
and
happiness
i
am
yours
most
truly
harry
chapter
xiii
three
days
after
harry
s
first
letter
reached
me
i
received
another
announcing
the
death
of
bramlett
and
informing
me
that
he
would
start
for
memphis
in
company
with
the
two
orphans
on
the
following
monday
with
a
view
of
placing
them
with
their
guardian
about
two
months
after
viola
had
arrived
at
her
new
home
with
ragland
s
family
i
received
another
long
letter
from
harry
the
perusal
of
which
caused
me
much
pain
and
as
i
think
it
would
assist
me
on
with
this
history
i
will
read
it
now
dear
eddie
it
is
with
a
heavy
heart
that
i
write
this
communication
because
things
are
not
going
on
well
here
by
any
means
and
i
would
not
distress
you
with
a
history
of
our
troubles
but
i
know
you
must
learn
of
them
sooner
or
later
viola
has
changed
very
much
since
she
arrived
here
two
months
ago
she
is
by
no
means
like
the
same
girl
she
was
when
she
came
here
last
fall
there
is
a
breach
between
her
and
me
that
grows
wider
every
day
since
she
became
aware
of
my
determination
not
to
place
myself
in
a
situation
where
the
world
would
be
justified
in
applying
the
dishonorable
name
of
to
me
i
was
alone
with
viola
one
day
in
lottie
s
flower
garden
happy
to
be
near
one
i
loved
so
devotedly
i
think
i
must
have
lost
control
of
myself
i
was
so
completely
overcome
with
my
passion
that
i
scarcely
knew
what
i
was
doing
i
think
she
concluded
that
i
was
about
to
make
a
declaration
of
my
love
for
her
and
to
make
her
an
offer
of
marriage
i
am
sure
i
do
not
know
exactly
what
i
did
say
but
i
will
try
to
tell
you
the
substance
of
what
occurred
she
was
pinning
a
rose
on
my
breast
while
her
sweet
lips
were
near
mine
and
i
seized
her
hand
and
kissed
it
miss
bramlett
said
i
how
beautiful
you
look
do
you
know
that
i
think
you
are
the
most
charming
girl
in
the
world
how
should
i
know
your
thoughts
wallingford
about
anything
when
you
are
so
cold
and
formal
with
me
you
always
talk
to
me
as
if
i
were
a
mere
stranger
whom
you
had
never
met
don
t
call
me
wallingford
i
beseech
you
speaking
of
coldness
that
makes
me
it
is
a
poor
rule
that
won
t
work
both
ways
you
made
it
and
should
not
now
complain
of
my
adopting
the
retort
is
just
and
i
have
no
right
to
complain
but
we
are
both
getting
to
be
quite
formal
of
late
nevertheless
i
may
be
permitted
to
think
and
speak
of
your
great
beauty
i
hope
without
offending
oh
no
offense
i
assure
you
wallingford
i
am
used
to
flattery
and
it
does
not
make
me
vain
at
no
doubt
you
are
often
annoyed
with
compliments
but
i
was
only
speaking
the
honest
truth
when
i
said
i
thought
you
were
the
most
beautiful
creature
i
ever
indeed
i
am
much
gratified
to
know
that
you
don
t
think
me
ugly
i
never
saw
but
one
gentleman
whom
i
thought
was
extra
handsome
but
alas
he
has
a
heart
as
cold
as
an
iceberg
and
is
too
proud
to
be
i
knew
in
an
instant
to
whom
she
alluded
and
i
felt
my
heart
begin
to
melt
at
once
may
i
know
the
name
of
this
wonderful
paragon
i
inquired
as
i
gazed
eagerly
into
her
expressive
eyes
oh
never
mind
his
name
he
is
a
particular
friend
of
mine
is
he
nothing
more
than
a
friend
miss
bramlett
if
he
is
he
is
too
proud
to
say
so
like
achilles
he
wraps
himself
up
with
his
cloak
of
selfishness
and
smiles
at
other
people
s
i
still
held
her
little
hand
in
mine
every
now
and
then
pressing
it
to
my
lips
viola
how
can
you
be
so
cruel
when
you
know
how
miserable
i
am
i
had
no
idea
that
you
were
miserable
pray
what
has
caused
it
i
love
one
whose
high
position
places
her
so
far
above
my
humble
sphere
that
i
know
she
never
can
be
we
are
all
equals
in
the
eyes
of
god
and
the
accidents
of
birth
or
fortune
should
make
no
difference
with
us
the
worth
of
the
man
should
be
measured
according
to
his
no
doubt
your
theory
is
altogether
correct
but
you
know
that
the
world
takes
a
different
view
of
it
a
man
who
strives
to
please
the
world
in
all
things
may
expect
to
please
himself
in
none
for
my
part
i
think
the
world
s
a
humbug
and
society
a
tyrant
and
the
man
who
worships
either
will
make
himself
miserable
i
believe
it
was
pope
in
his
essay
on
man
who
said
honor
and
shame
from
no
condition
rise
act
well
your
part
there
all
the
honor
lies
worth
makes
the
man
and
want
of
it
the
fellow
the
rest
is
all
but
leather
and
viola
don
t
you
know
that
i
have
been
loving
you
devotedly
ever
since
we
first
met
her
head
sank
down
and
she
turned
her
face
from
me
to
hide
the
tears
that
were
streaming
from
her
eyes
i
was
crazy
with
passion
my
brain
was
on
fire
i
forgot
my
pride
i
lost
my
i
was
for
the
time
being
raving
mad
with
love
i
took
her
in
my
arms
and
held
her
against
my
heart
her
head
resting
on
my
shoulder
i
would
be
willing
to
suffer
a
long
life
of
pain
for
an
hour
of
such
joy
but
alas
it
could
never
be
suddenly
i
recollected
what
i
had
done
i
saw
the
folly
of
it
nay
i
began
to
see
the
meanness
of
it
and
my
cheeks
burned
with
shame
i
felt
like
a
cowardly
sneak
i
sprang
away
from
viola
pardon
my
presumption
miss
bramlett
upon
my
honor
i
was
joking
i
beg
you
to
forgive
and
forget
me
i
did
not
think
of
the
impropriety
of
my
conduct
let
us
be
good
friends
that
is
all
i
ask
nothing
more
i
shall
go
to
california
i
i
could
have
loved
you
miss
bramlett
under
different
circumstances
but
as
it
is
i
must
try
to
forget
you
let
us
part
as
i
took
her
hand
in
mine
it
was
as
cold
as
ice
and
her
face
was
deadly
pale
i
started
to
leave
her
i
had
gone
about
twenty
paces
from
her
when
i
heard
a
groan
such
a
groan
of
despair
as
never
before
broke
on
my
ear
it
was
not
loud
but
sounded
like
the
knell
of
death
to
me
i
hastened
back
and
found
viola
lying
on
the
ground
apparently
dead
her
temple
stained
with
blood
that
came
from
a
severe
wound
which
she
had
received
from
falling
against
a
corner
of
the
bench
for
a
moment
i
was
paralyzed
with
horror
the
first
thought
that
occurred
to
my
mind
being
that
she
had
committed
suicide
but
lottie
had
heard
the
groan
and
came
running
to
ascertain
the
cause
she
sat
down
and
placed
viola
s
head
on
her
lap
and
began
to
wipe
the
blood
from
her
temple
bring
water
quick
harry
said
lottie
i
hastened
to
the
house
seized
a
bucket
of
water
and
was
back
in
a
moment
lottie
sprinkled
viola
s
face
and
bathed
her
temples
and
in
a
short
time
signs
of
returning
life
were
appearing
i
was
gratified
to
find
that
the
wound
was
not
serious
and
that
all
danger
was
over
i
lifted
viola
in
my
arms
and
carried
her
to
the
house
having
my
bosom
stained
with
her
precious
blood
she
did
not
open
her
eyes
at
all
while
i
was
carrying
her
to
the
house
but
i
saw
tears
falling
rapidly
from
them
i
whispered
a
few
words
to
lottie
by
way
of
directing
her
what
course
to
pursue
as
i
placed
viola
on
a
sofa
and
fled
like
a
coward
from
the
premises
i
know
you
will
condemn
my
conduct
and
i
know
i
deserve
it
but
as
god
in
heaven
is
my
judge
i
meant
to
do
nothing
wrong
my
reason
was
overthrown
by
my
intense
passion
you
have
been
in
love
yourself
and
can
readily
understand
how
love
can
steal
away
one
s
reason
who
can
love
as
i
love
viola
and
then
be
discreet
who
can
retain
his
senses
when
his
blood
is
boiling
in
his
veins
and
his
brain
on
fire
i
confess
my
conduct
was
shameful
disgraceful
and
cowardly
i
should
never
have
placed
myself
under
the
influence
of
her
charms
i
should
have
kept
my
love
for
her
a
secret
but
in
her
presence
i
could
not
do
it
i
have
sworn
a
solemn
oath
that
i
would
never
ask
her
to
marry
me
while
i
am
penniless
and
she
so
rich
i
thought
i
was
right
then
and
i
have
never
changed
my
mind
having
made
that
resolve
it
was
criminal
in
me
to
act
as
i
did
i
think
i
shall
go
to
california
soon
because
i
can
not
endure
the
torture
that
will
be
mine
if
i
remain
near
her
i
am
foolish
enough
call
it
vanity
if
you
please
to
think
that
if
i
were
in
california
i
might
make
a
fortune
in
a
few
years
then
i
could
claim
viola
s
hand
without
feeling
degraded
in
my
own
estimation
i
never
until
lately
cared
to
be
rich
but
now
i
would
make
any
sacrifice
endure
any
hardship
to
accumulate
wealth
viola
left
our
house
the
next
morning
after
the
affair
in
the
garden
and
has
never
been
back
any
more
the
occurrence
mentioned
happened
two
weeks
ago
and
i
must
say
i
have
never
seen
such
a
change
in
any
one
as
has
come
over
viola
the
beautiful
rosy
tint
has
left
her
fair
cheeks
and
her
disposition
seems
to
have
undergone
an
unaccountable
change
her
conduct
is
causing
her
friends
great
pain
and
uneasiness
she
treats
lottie
with
a
strange
coldness
and
passes
me
with
a
dignified
bow
she
has
become
perfectly
reckless
with
her
money
seems
to
be
determined
to
get
rid
of
it
she
does
not
use
it
in
showy
dress
or
costly
jewelry
but
is
giving
it
away
to
the
poor
as
fast
as
she
can
her
guardian
endeavors
to
restrain
her
but
she
heeds
not
his
counsel
or
his
commands
she
appears
only
to
study
the
best
and
fastest
way
to
get
rid
of
her
money
she
says
she
hates
the
very
name
of
money
and
that
she
means
to
give
it
all
to
the
poor
as
soon
as
it
comes
into
her
hands
ragland
says
her
income
is
very
great
but
that
within
two
weeks
just
passed
she
has
given
away
one
whole
year
s
income
and
is
borrowing
more
of
course
she
can
borrow
as
much
as
she
pleases
and
seems
to
be
determined
to
use
her
credit
what
is
to
be
the
result
of
this
strange
freak
god
only
knows
i
wish
you
were
here
for
she
might
be
influenced
by
you
she
always
appeared
to
like
you
her
guardian
is
greatly
distressed
at
her
conduct
he
says
it
is
inexplicable
to
him
i
fear
that
something
awful
is
going
to
happen
you
would
not
think
it
possible
for
any
one
to
undergo
such
a
radical
change
as
she
has
come
home
as
quickly
as
you
can
you
may
be
able
to
do
something
with
her
lottie
is
overwhelmed
with
grief
we
are
all
in
despair
her
guardian
has
given
up
all
hope
start
immediately
i
shall
leave
for
california
as
soon
as
you
arrive
my
uncle
has
made
a
great
fortune
there
he
offers
to
aid
me
if
i
will
come
and
i
shall
accept
his
offer
at
once
i
must
get
away
from
here
at
all
hazards
as
soon
as
possible
probably
viola
would
recover
her
former
gay
and
lively
feelings
if
i
were
away
if
her
entire
fortune
were
now
under
her
control
she
would
give
it
away
in
a
month
she
is
annoyed
with
many
suitors
but
she
gives
none
of
them
any
encouragement
in
fact
they
complain
that
she
does
not
even
treat
them
respectfully
lottie
joins
me
in
love
to
you
and
also
in
the
hope
that
you
will
come
home
soon
after
this
letter
reaches
you
dear
lottie
is
quite
low
spirited
since
viola
has
quit
visiting
us
and
nothing
but
your
presence
here
can
revive
her
it
is
useless
to
tell
you
how
much
lottie
loves
you
because
you
have
known
that
all
the
time
she
is
a
dear
darling
sister
god
bless
her
she
will
make
you
a
good
wife
hoping
to
see
you
at
home
very
soon
i
am
yours
truly
harry
within
hours
after
the
receipt
of
that
letter
i
was
on
my
way
home
and
although
i
was
being
hurried
on
at
the
rate
of
forty
miles
an
hour
i
felt
as
if
i
were
going
at
a
snail
s
pace
when
i
arrived
at
home
i
of
course
went
to
see
lottie
before
talking
with
any
one
else
i
found
my
darling
all
that
heart
could
wish
she
was
more
beautiful
more
charming
in
my
eyes
than
ever
the
large
dreamy
blue
eyes
were
swimming
in
tears
of
joy
as
i
held
her
to
my
glad
heart
and
i
saw
a
look
of
love
that
satisfied
me
that
i
was
the
possessor
of
a
treasure
of
great
value
i
lingered
by
my
darling
s
side
until
late
at
night
every
little
trifling
incident
was
described
the
days
of
old
were
alluded
to
and
discussed
while
the
present
and
future
came
in
for
a
full
share
harry
s
case
was
adverted
to
and
plans
suggested
by
which
we
hoped
to
be
able
to
bring
about
a
reconciliation
between
viola
and
him
old
bob
was
dead
and
had
been
honored
with
a
grave
in
lottie
s
flower
garden
old
roderick
was
alive
and
in
splendid
humor
for
talking
when
lottie
and
i
called
to
see
him
at
his
headquarters
ah

screamed
the
old
parrot
as
he
jumped
down
on
lottie
s
shoulders
ah
ha
here

my
boy
exclaimed
dodson
as
he
met
me
at
the
door
and
gathered
me
by
both
shoulders
holding
me
square
before
him
and
gazing
into
my
face
with
his
kind
keen
eyes
first
drawing
me
close
to
him
then
pushing
me
back
as
if
inspecting
some
article
he
intended
to
purchase
ah
ha

boy

booby

my
boy
i
did
not
have
time
to
answer
his
questions
he
pitched
them
in
so
thickly
and
rapidly
that
i
could
not
have
put
a
word
in
glad
to
see
you
home

boy

of
work

her
first

life

was
a
fool

myself

i
was
young

fools
when
in
love
i
was
in
love
with
dolly
when
she
was
young

then
he
shoved
me
in
the
house
calling
at
the
top
of
his
voice
here
dolly
our
old
boy
has
come
at
last
hug
him

then
scold
him
roundly
for
going
to
see
lottie
before
coming
to
see
us
ah
ha
yes
he
did
a
rascal
lottie
is
making
a
fool
of
him
fact
is
she
is
making
a
fool
of
herself
also
well
well
old
woman
we
were
young
once
ourselves
you
know
how
it
is
yourself
the
next
morning
i
sought
an
interview
with
harry
and
was
deeply
pained
to
see
the
change
that
had
taken
place
in
his
appearance
his
face
was
very
pale
his
cheeks
appeared
to
be
sunken
and
his
general
appearance
indicated
great
mental
anguish
the
lively
smile
that
used
to
light
up
his
handsome
face
in
the
days
of
old
was
absent
now
he
greeted
me
kindly
but
the
tone
of
his
voice
made
me
shiver
it
was
so
melancholy
that
it
startled
me
how
is
she
now
i
inquired
alluding
of
course
to
viola
worse
all
the
time
growing
more
reckless
said
he
with
a
mournful
shake
of
the
head
for
heaven
s
sake
go
see
her
at
why
not
go
yourself
i
asked
you
could
have
more
influence
with
her
than
all
the
men
in
the
no
no
i
dare
not
go
near
her
my
senses
always
forsake
me
when
i
am
in
her
presence
i
must
go
away
from
memphis
nonsense
why
must
you
go
away
why
not
discard
this
foolish
pride
and
marry
her
and
be
happy
if
that
is
the
only
advice
you
have
to
offer
we
will
let
the
subject
drop
my
mind
is
settled
on
that
question
and
it
must
not
be
mentioned
any
the
money
is
mine
viola
would
reply
to
ragland
s
remonstrances
regarding
the
reckless
manner
in
which
she
was
squandering
it
and
why
should
i
not
do
with
it
as
i
please
who
has
any
right
to
say
when
and
how
i
shall
use
it
who
has
any
right
to
dictate
to
me
on
that
subject
this
hateful
fortune
has
been
my
bane
and
i
mean
to
rid
myself
of
it
as
soon
as
possible
are
there
not
thousands
of
poor
people
in
this
city
who
need
money
are
there
not
thousands
who
toil
the
day
and
then
go
to
bed
at
night
hungry
yes
yes
you
know
it
well
i
mean
to
give
all
my
money
to
them
and
hire
myself
out
to
work
as
a
governess
if
i
can
and
if
i
can
t
do
that
i
ll
wash
or
sew
nay
i
ll
serve
as
at
a
hotel
before
i
ll
keep
this
hateful
money
has
it
not
already
ruined
my
hopes
of
happiness
forever
has
it
not
surrounded
me
with
false
friends
has
it
not
overflowed
me
with
a
brigade
of
brainless
whose
silly
twaddle
about
love
makes
me
sick
this
accursed
gold
drives
true
friends
from
me
and
attracts
about
me
a
host
of
senseless
flatterers
whose
very
presence
is
hateful
to
there
was
no
boisterous
bluster
about
her
manner
no
outburst
of
passion
but
a
quiet
determined
expression
was
indelibly
impressed
on
her
features
it
did
not
require
a
solomon
to
tell
me
that
harry
was
responsible
for
all
this
it
was
as
plain
as
the
sun
at
noontide
what
should
i
do
next
was
the
question
that
naturally
presented
itself
to
me
should
i
sit
down
fold
my
hands
and
quietly
wait
for
the
grand
which
would
be
sure
to
come
unless
something
was
done
to
prevent
it
or
should
i
put
forth
all
my
energies
to
save
two
young
hearts
from
utter
ruin
i
was
deeply
impressed
with
the
magnitude
of
the
situation
yet
at
a
loss
to
know
what
course
to
pursue
in
order
to
change
it
having
pondered
over
the
matter
until
i
was
half
sick
and
badly
puzzled
in
a
spirit
of
desperation
i
broached
the
subject
to
viola
harry
is
going
to
california
i
said
to
her
we
are
all
greatly
distressed
about
it
and
you
might
prevent
it
if
you
would
and
pray
demar
tell
me
what
i
have
to
do
with
the
movements
of
wallingford
i
thought
you
might
not
wish
him
to
go
i
said
timidly
indeed
demar
let
me
assure
you
that
wallingford
s
plans
are
in
no
respect
of
interest
to
me
he
may
go
to
jerusalem
if
he
thinks
it
will
promote
his
happiness
or
to
california
or
to
hindostan
or
to
the
north
pole
or
anywhere
else
what
is
it
to
me
i
am
just
now
engaged
in
attending
to
my
own
business
and
i
imagine
that
wallingford
is
pursuing
the
same
line
of
policy
i
am
sure
i
wish
him
success
in
all
his
don
t
you
know
that
pride
is
drawing
both
of
you
apart
stop
i
beseech
you
before
it
is
too
late
send
a
message
to
harry
by
me
let
me
tell
him
you
wish
to
see
i
have
no
message
to
send
him
why
should
i
wish
to
see
him
achilles
must
occupy
his
lofty
tent
and
let
greece
bleed
at
every
vein
when
patroclus
is
dead
then
he
may
condescend
to
take
the
field
as
she
uttered
those
words
she
was
pacing
the
floor
rapidly
back
and
forth
while
a
strange
fire
flashed
from
her
pretty
eyes
she
moved
like
a
queen
and
i
saw
the
signs
of
intense
passion
disturbing
her
bosom
the
truth
is
she
was
hard
pressed
for
courage
to
keep
from
exposing
her
love
for
harry
give
me
that
rose
you
have
on
your
throat
i
said
and
let
me
tell
harry
you
sent
it
to
no
no
i
might
offend
this
proud
greek
let
him
enjoy
his
pride
why
should
he
be
disturbed
by
others
woes
do
you
remember
the
first
lines
of
the
iliad
achilles
wrath
to
greece
the
direful
spring
of
woes
unnumbered
heavenly
goddess
i
am
no
goddess
but
i
mean
to
write
a
song
and
sing
the
proud
man
s
praise
until
his
great
deeds
done
in
the
business
shall
resound
throughout
the
land
you
had
better
marry
lottie
demar
without
delay
she
is
his
sister
you
know
and
might
catch
the
inspiration
and
learn
to
despise
common
miss
bramlett
for
heaven
s
sake
don
t
talk
that
way
you
know
how
lottie
loves
you
she
would
go
any
length
to
serve
you
harry
worships
you
and
all
will
go
well
if
you
will
only
give
him
a
little
kind
i
can
only
repeat
what
i
have
already
said
i
have
no
message
for
i
left
her
with
heavy
feelings
weighing
on
my
mind
time
rolled
on
we
all
rolled
on
too
or
rather
drifted
on
toward
our
fate
at
the
end
of
six
months
matters
were
not
improved
but
had
continued
to
grow
worse
lottie
was
as
true
to
me
as
the
needle
to
the
pole
not
a
wave
of
misunderstanding
ever
crossed
the
calm
sea
of
our
happiness
all
my
spare
moments
were
spent
by
her
side
we
were
too
happy
to
look
into
the
dim
future
but
we
drank
in
the
sweet
pleasure
of
the
present
little
dreaming
of
the
great
cloud
of
woe
that
was
gathering
over
our
heads
soon
to
burst
on
us
with
all
its
fury
shortly
after
the
misunderstanding
between
harry
and
viola
he
had
fallen
ill
and
for
six
weeks
his
life
seemed
to
be
ebbing
away
slowly
but
thanks
to
doctor
dodson
s
skill
and
lottie
s
nursing
the
vital
spark
was
kept
in
the
body
until
nature
came
to
the
rescue
his
illness
caused
him
to
postpone
his
trip
to
california
at
least
until
fall
and
we
were
encouraged
to
hope
that
we
should
be
able
to
get
him
to
abandon
the
trip
entirely
i
still
clung
to
the
idea
that
he
and
viola
would
not
drift
apart
forever
viola
never
visited
lottie
after
the
trouble
with
harry
i
saw
her
about
four
weeks
after
harry
was
taken
ill
i
was
not
prepared
to
look
for
or
expect
such
a
change
as
was
visible
in
her
appearance
she
presented
a
perfect
picture
of
despair
her
beautiful
eyes
had
a
languid
listless
look
in
them
that
told
plainly
how
she
was
suffering
was
this
the
beautiful
gay
little
girl
that
i
had
heard
lottie
call
the
lively
little
cricket
was
it
possible
that
one
could
change
in
that
way
in
so
short
a
time
i
could
scarcely
believe
the
evidence
of
my
own
eyes
when
i
informed
her
that
harry
was
very
ill
and
that
we
all
thought
he
was
going
to
die
she
started
gazed
wildly
at
me
for
a
moment
then
burst
into
tears
i
was
in
hopes
i
would
go
first
she
said
but
i
can
follow
him
soon
there
will
be
no
money
up
there
to
keep
us
when
i
repeated
her
very
words
to
him
he
was
deeply
affected
which
increased
my
hopes
of
a
reconciliation
he
was
greatly
changed
in
many
respects
and
i
thought
the
prospects
of
an
understanding
were
brightening
the
time
was
near
at
hand
when
i
was
to
go
to
philadelphia
again
to
take
my
last
course
before
receiving
my
diploma
rockland
had
at
last
consented
that
lottie
and
i
should
be
married
when
i
returned
during
the
summer
viola
contracted
a
large
number
of
debts
after
having
exhausted
her
cash
income
her
guardian
was
very
greatly
annoyed
and
embarrassed
by
the
demands
of
the
creditors
and
was
threatening
to
resign
his
office
as
guardian
the
trustees
in
new
york
were
complaining
of
the
continuous
calls
made
on
them
for
money
and
had
promptly
refused
to
encourage
such
extravagance
i
must
however
do
viola
the
justice
to
say
that
she
did
not
squander
the
money
where
it
would
do
no
good
but
was
distributing
it
among
the
worthy
poor
people
of
the
city
i
was
invited
one
day
to
go
with
her
on
a
visit
among
the
suffering
people
who
were
the
recipients
of
her
bounty
and
before
i
had
finished
the
visit
i
had
occasion
to
change
the
unfavorable
opinion
i
had
formed
in
regard
to
her
conduct
she
went
about
the
matter
in
a
manner
interrogated
a
family
ascertained
what
was
needed
to
make
them
comfortable
gave
an
order
on
a
merchant
for
the
articles
and
passed
on
to
the
next
family
repeating
the
same
good
work
there
i
saw
large
numbers
of
ragged
children
clinging
to
her
skirts
and
pressing
kisses
on
her
hands
while
sickly
mothers
were
praying
for
heaven
s
richest
blessings
to
fall
on
the
dear
angel
who
had
kept
their
children
from
starving
as
i
witnessed
those
affecting
scenes
i
was
more
inclined
to
indorse
viola
s
course
than
i
was
to
condemn
it
the
first
of
october
found
me
again
in
philadelphia
hard
at
work
and
full
of
bright
hopes
as
to
the
future
reading
lottie
s
sweet
letters
of
love
and
thinking
of
the
happy
day
that
was
soon
to
make
her
my
wife
chapter
xiv
one
morning
some
three
months
after
my
arrival
in
philadelphia
i
was
seated
at
the
breakfast
table
of
the
girard
hotel
when
a
servant
laid
a
letter
on
my
plate
i
saw
from
the
postmark
that
it
was
from
memphis
and
i
recognized
the
handwriting
as
harry
s
i
lost
no
time
of
course
in
opening
it
before
i
had
read
it
half
through
i
was
perfectly
paralyzed
with
horror
and
made
an
effort
to
rise
from
my
seat
with
a
view
of
going
immediately
to
my
room
i
staggered
like
a
man
intoxicated
and
would
have
fallen
to
the
floor
but
that
the
steward
caught
me
and
kindly
led
me
from
the
room
your
letter
brings
you
bad
news
i
fear
demar
you
seem
to
be
quite
overcome
shall
i
get
you
a
glass
of
wine
sir
no
thank
you
i
groaned
rather
than
spoke
help
me
to
my
room
i
wish
to
be
several
of
my
friends
seeing
that
something
serious
had
happened
surrounded
me
insisting
that
i
should
tell
them
what
the
matter
was
but
i
begged
them
to
leave
me
as
i
wished
to
be
alone
it
is
nothing
my
friends
said
i
in
which
you
can
be
of
any
assistance
to
me
i
have
received
awful
news
from
home
and
shall
take
the
first
train
to
go
there
i
implore
you
leave
me
alone
i
must
think
i
must
act
and
that
my
request
was
complied
with
and
the
steward
kindly
assisted
me
to
my
room
and
left
me
alone
my
hands
trembled
so
i
scarcely
could
hold
the
letter
still
long
enough
to
finish
reading
it
and
when
i
read
it
to
you
which
i
mean
to
do
you
will
not
be
surprised
at
the
manner
in
which
its
contents
shook
my
nerves
it
is
true
that
i
had
been
anticipating
evil
but
never
had
dreamed
of
such
an
awful
thing
as
was
described
in
harry
s
letter
my
mind
was
not
prepared
for
such
dreadful
news
i
turned
the
paper
on
which
the
fatal
news
was
written
over
and
over
read
and
the
lines
endeavoring
to
find
something
that
would
raise
a
doubt
as
to
the
handwriting
but
no
it
was
harry
s
hand
beyond
all
question
the
awful
tidings
were
too
true
i
fell
on
a
sofa
buried
my
face
in
my
hands
and
endeavored
to
collect
my
scattered
thoughts
in
order
that
i
might
take
such
action
as
the
nature
of
the
case
demanded
how
long
i
remained
in
that
position
i
am
unable
to
say
but
it
was
a
great
while
before
i
could
regain
composure
sufficient
to
write
as
soon
as
i
could
command
my
nerves
i
hastily
penned
the
following
note
dr
vannesse
dear
sir
i
would
esteem
it
a
very
great
favor
if
you
would
visit
me
at
my
room
at
the
girard
hotel
without
delay
as
i
wish
to
consult
you
about
a
matter
of
the
gravest
importance
news
of
a
most
distressing
character
has
just
reached
me
from
my
home
in
memphis
tennessee
which
makes
it
necessary
for
me
to
go
there
immediately
i
would
have
gone
to
your
quarters
but
the
shock
caused
by
the
awful
news
has
almost
prostrated
me
hence
i
must
implore
you
to
come
to
me
respectfully
edward
i
rang
the
bell
it
was
answered
by
a
little
boy
take
this
note
to
doctor
vannesse
at
his
rooms
over
at
the
continental
hotel
as
quickly
as
you
can
tell
the
porter
to
come
up
after
my
baggage
at
one
o
clock
and
have
it
checked
to
memphis
and
tell
the
clerk
to
prepare
my
bill
i
wish
to
settle
it
were
the
orders
i
gave
to
the
bell
boy
then
i
began
to
pack
my
trunks
and
arrange
everything
for
my
journey
southward
while
the
only
consoling
thought
that
came
to
my
relief
was
that
i
should
soon
see
lottie
at
all
events
the
bell
boy
had
been
gone
with
my
note
but
a
very
few
moments
when
doctor
vannesse
came
dashing
into
my
room
his
handsome
features
blazing
with
excitement
demar
what
on
earth
has
happened
you
look
like
a
corpse
tell
me
quick
i
beseech
you
it
must
be
something
dreadful
to
make
you
look
so
pale
indeed
it
is
dreadful
nay
it
is
horrible
i
never
have
heard
of
such
a
thing
before
in
all
the
days
of
my
no
doubt
no
doubt
whatever
but
why
do
you
not
tell
me
what
it
is
be
seated
doctor
said
i
and
you
shall
know
but
first
let
me
ask
you
to
furnish
me
the
name
of
the
best
and
most
experienced
detective
officer
in
philadelphia
i
want
one
to
go
with
me
to
memphis
we
have
splendid
officers
there
but
i
am
requested
to
bring
one
from
here
so
that
we
can
have
the
services
of
both
departments
there
is
a
strange
case
to
be
worked
up
great
skill
and
experience
will
be
required
as
i
think
and
i
sent
for
you
to
get
your
advice
about
the
employment
of
some
one
here
whose
reputation
is
his
dabbs
zip
dabbs
is
the
man
you
want
if
he
can
t
work
up
your
case
it
is
not
workable
he
can
pump
all
the
secrets
out
of
a
man
while
he
makes
the
fellow
think
he
is
receiving
instead
of
giving
information
i
guess
you
have
heard
of
zip
dabbs
everybody
knows
him
by
reputation
he
is
the
very
man
you
want
i
ll
go
with
you
to
see
him
it
is
doubtful
whether
you
can
induce
him
to
go
with
you
so
far
from
his
usual
field
of
action
then
it
might
cost
you
more
than
you
are
willing
to
pay
he
charges
very
high
for
his
i
care
not
for
his
charges
was
my
reply
he
shall
be
weighted
down
with
money
if
he
wants
it
money
is
no
object
with
us
in
this
then
i
advise
you
to
go
and
see
zip
at
once
for
he
worships
money
and
will
go
with
you
to
the
end
of
the
world
if
you
will
pay
him
well
you
have
of
course
heard
the
old
maxim
set
a
thief
to
catch
a
thief
well
that
applies
to
zip
dabbs
with
double
compound
force
he
is
well
acquainted
with
the
inside
walls
of
many
prisons
and
has
spent
a
great
part
of
his
life
therein
but
he
has
discovered
a
great
secret
and
that
is
that
he
can
make
more
money
by
putting
other
men
in
the
penitentiary
than
he
can
by
going
there
himself
he
can
change
from
a
politician
to
a
dray
driver
in
five
minutes
and
the
change
is
so
radical
that
no
one
can
detect
him
i
have
seen
him
spading
a
garden
in
an
old
red
flannel
shirt
the
hottest
day
of
the
summer
season
and
at
night
dressed
with
exquisite
taste
making
the
most
melodious
music
on
a
piano
he
is
a
splendid
musician
sings
and
plays
as
well
as
anybody
he
is
as
industrious
as
a
honey
bee
a
splendid
piano
tuner
and
by
this
means
often
gains
admission
to
high
circles
where
he
wishes
to
obtain
secrets
that
are
locked
safely
from
ordinary
people
he
is
the
most
extraordinary
man
i
ever
saw
plays
political
demagogue
to
perfection
makes
a
splendid
speech
when
he
sets
his
head
to
the
business
can
change
from
a
green
bashful
hoosier
to
a
polished
man
of
the
world
in
ten
minutes
he
has
reduced
the
art
of
disguising
to
a
perfect
science
and
can
make
his
way
through
locks
without
keys
i
hope
you
will
be
able
to
engage
him
he
is
the
very
man
you
want
but
by
the
by
old
fellow
you
have
not
informed
me
what
has
happened
that
causes
you
to
want
a
please
let
us
go
and
see
this
man
first
i
wish
to
leave
on
the
train
this
afternoon
he
may
want
time
to
get
ready
we
had
better
see
him
first
i
can
talk
with
you
more
at
leisure
after
we
have
conferred
with
dabbs
if
you
will
accompany
me
i
shall
be
under
many
obligations
and
then
i
will
detail
to
you
the
unfortunate
intelligence
which
has
made
it
necessary
for
me
to
employ
a
sharp
ah
yes
yes
you
are
right
demar
i
see
you
understand
how
to
economize
time
that
s
quite
a
gift
time
you
know
rolls
on
whether
we
roll
or
not
it
is
a
great
thing
to
know
how
to
roll
on
so
as
never
to
be
behind
time
we
can
go
and
find
dabbs
first
and
confer
with
him
then
while
we
talk
matters
over
he
can
make
his
arrangements
so
as
to
be
ready
to
go
with
come
along
then
demar
we
ll
go
to
dabbs
quarters
now
he
holds
forth
on
chestnut
street
just
below
independence
hall
you
may
have
noticed
his
sign
sticking
on
a
shabby
panel
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
on
the
right
as
you
go
down
the
street
beyond
the
hall
queer
man
is
dabbs
you
had
better
let
me
do
the
talking
as
i
know
better
how
to
manage
him
perhaps
than
a
mere
stranger
would
i
hope
we
shall
find
him
disengaged
though
it
would
be
the
merest
accident
if
we
did
for
he
is
nearly
always
busy
he
does
more
work
than
all
the
other
detectives
in
the
city
by
the
by
here
s
his
headquarters
now
shabby
quarters
aren
t
they
seems
to
me
if
i
could
coin
money
as
he
does
i
d
rent
more
comfortable
rooms
just
look
at
the
dirt
on
that
floor
don
t
think
it
has
been
swept
since
the
declaration
of
independence
i
declare
i
can
t
see
how
people
can
stand
so
much
dirt
phew
what
an
infernal
stench
comes
up
through
that
hole
i
must
call
the
attention
of
the
sanitary
board
to
it
i
declare
it
is
abominable
detestable
but
come
along
and
let
us
get
away
from
this
place
as
soon
as
we
where
is
dabbs
inquired
doctor
vannesse
of
a
little
man
with
a
very
sharp
nose
the
end
of
which
seemed
to
be
making
a
desperate
effort
to
get
into
his
mouth
gone
out
sir
was
the
answer
made
in
a
voice
that
sounded
like
the
grunt
of
a
hog
i
guessed
he
was
out
sir
as
it
is
very
plain
that
he
is
not
in
said
the
doctor
angrily
i
confess
that
the
man
s
very
looks
was
an
insult
and
his
voice
was
worse
than
assault
and
battery
he
was
smoking
a
cheap
cigar
his
all
stained
with
tobacco
juice
his
little
round
head
was
covered
with
a
profusion
of
coarse
black
hair
standing
out
like
porcupine
quills
and
i
thought
he
was
drunk
as
soon
as
i
saw
him
when
will
dabbs
be
in
asked
the
doctor
dunno
was
the
grunt
where
can
he
be
found
what
do
you
know
about
dabbs
nuthin
come
along
demar
that
fellow
s
drunk
maybe
we
can
find
some
one
on
the
next
floor
who
can
give
us
some
we
had
not
reached
the
door
when
i
heard
some
one
behind
me
call
doctor
vannesse
in
a
most
pleasant
voice
and
turning
round
we
discovered
the
man
laughing
as
if
he
would
shake
himself
to
pieces
ha
ha
ha
didn
t
know
me
did
you
doc
thought
i
was
drunk
too
ha
ha
ha
come
back
and
take
seats
what
can
i
do
for
you
i
was
filled
with
astonishment
he
was
the
very
man
we
were
looking
for
so
completely
disguised
that
doctor
vannesse
who
had
seen
him
a
thousand
times
did
not
recognize
him
i
never
heard
a
more
pleasant
tone
of
voice
and
his
manners
were
those
of
a
gentleman
by
jove
dabbs
exclaimed
the
doctor
i
came
very
near
knocking
you
down
with
a
chair
who
would
have
thought
it
was
you
what
s
up
dabbs
that
makes
you
look
like
old
nick
s
engineer
some
of
old
nick
s
agents
have
been
out
on
an
excursion
but
i
ve
got
em
jugged
had
just
finished
up
the
job
five
minutes
before
you
came
in
it
s
a
case
of
poisoning
always
very
difficult
to
work
up
you
know
but
i
peeled
the
peach
at
last
they
had
the
wrong
man
arrested
as
is
usual
in
such
cases
but
i
unearthed
the
guilty
one
and
he
s
sure
to
get
a
through
well
dabbs
demar
here
who
is
a
friend
of
mine
has
a
job
on
hand
which
he
wishes
you
to
work
up
he
wants
you
to
go
with
him
to
memphis
money
is
no
object
in
this
case
the
pay
will
be
liberal
can
you
go
i
guess
so
unless
the
boss
has
something
on
hand
just
wait
here
a
moment
i
ll
go
and
see
him
nothing
would
suit
me
better
than
a
trip
down
in
thus
saying
he
disappeared
through
a
back
door
leaving
the
doctor
and
me
alone
deuced
sharp
fellow
i
assure
you
demar
works
like
a
beaver
and
hangs
on
like
a
badger
never
fails
to
bring
the
truth
to
the
surface
i
hope
you
will
secure
i
shall
consider
myself
lucky
indeed
if
i
can
take
him
with
me
to
memphis
the
case
he
has
been
telling
us
about
is
somewhat
similar
to
the
one
i
have
on
ah
indeed
then
he
will
be
the
better
prepared
to
work
it
up
by
the
way
here
he
comes
now
how
is
it
dabbs
can
you
go
yes
it
is
all
right
when
do
you
wish
me
to
start
demar
on
the
train
this
afternoon
pittsburg
line
can
you
be
ready
by
that
time
oh
yes
i
m
always
ready
let
me
know
the
nature
of
the
case
you
wish
me
to
investigate
it
may
be
necessary
to
send
a
telegram
immediately
nothing
like
getting
an
early
start
in
affairs
of
this
kind
a
warm
track
is
much
easier
to
follow
than
a
cold
one
i
happen
to
have
an
old
partner
in
memphis
which
i
consider
quite
a
lucky
thing
in
this
instance
i
ll
send
a
dispatch
directing
him
what
to
do
until
i
arrive
tadpoddle
will
be
of
invaluable
service
to
me
for
he
has
worked
in
memphis
in
my
line
for
many
years
give
me
your
case
at
once
demar
and
then
i
ll
telegraph
tadpoddle
what
to
this
will
lead
you
into
the
light
of
the
matter
dabbs
i
said
handing
him
the
letter
i
had
received
from
harry
when
he
had
read
the
letter
he
handed
it
back
to
me
saying
bad
job
demar
these
kind
of
cases
are
very
difficult
to
manage
but
tadpoddle
and
i
can
do
it
if
it
can
be
done
i
have
just
finished
up
a
case
similar
to
this
one
and
i
must
say
that
crimes
of
that
kind
are
increasing
fearfully
and
the
worst
of
it
is
the
suspicion
in
a
majority
of
such
cases
falls
on
the
wrong
man
i
trust
it
will
prove
so
in
this
one
if
it
should
however
turn
out
that
they
have
arrested
the
right
one
i
must
say
it
is
a
most
horrible
affair
i
am
glad
that
your
friend
wallingford
acted
so
promptly
in
having
the
premises
placed
in
charge
of
an
officer
it
will
facilitate
our
work
very
much
then
it
prevents
any
smuggling
or
putting
out
of
tracks
by
accomplices
which
is
often
done
by
partners
in
crime
you
may
go
now
demar
i
ll
meet
you
at
the
depot
in
time
for
the
train
i
have
nothing
to
do
but
pack
up
my
traps
which
won
t
take
many
well
demar
said
doctor
vannesse
let
us
go
to
your
room
now
and
then
i
will
hear
a
history
of
this
case
of
i
went
by
the
telegraph
office
and
sent
a
dispatch
to
harry
informing
him
that
i
would
start
immediately
accompanied
by
the
best
detective
officer
in
the
city
guard
the
premises
closely
life
and
death
may
depend
on
that
were
the
closing
words
of
my
dispatch
arriving
at
my
room
i
handed
harry
s
letter
to
doctor
vannesse
and
while
he
was
reading
i
sat
and
watched
the
changes
in
his
countenance
wrought
by
the
dreadful
news
it
contained
by
jove
demar
this
is
most
horrible
it
beats
anything
i
ever
heard
of
do
you
think
she
is
guilty
if
she
committed
the
murder
she
was
insane
she
never
did
it
while
in
her
proper
mind
she
was
more
like
an
angel
than
a
murderess
the
idea
that
she
committed
murder
for
money
is
absurd
she
hated
money
and
was
scattering
her
fortune
promiscuously
among
the
poor
and
needy
there
has
been
a
strangeness
in
her
conduct
for
the
last
eight
months
which
has
greatly
puzzled
her
friends
and
it
may
be
possible
that
her
mind
was
not
right
she
had
had
a
misunderstanding
with
a
young
gentleman
to
whom
she
was
very
much
ah
yes
i
see
how
it
is
she
has
been
laboring
under
temporary
insanity
said
the
doctor
but
i
fear
that
will
not
avail
her
in
this
case
the
pleas
of
insanity
are
becoming
so
frequent
that
all
courts
view
them
with
suspicion
i
most
earnestly
hope
you
will
be
able
to
establish
her
innocence
write
to
me
demar
often
and
keep
me
posted
as
to
the
progress
of
this
case
i
shall
not
be
able
to
discard
it
from
my
mind
until
i
know
the
final
result
old
fellow
i
must
leave
you
now
success
to
you
my
respects
to
that
charming
girl
you
are
always
talking
about
i
d
give
a
quarter
s
salary
to
see
her
if
she
is
half
so
pretty
as
you
say
she
is
it
would
delight
me
to
look
at
her
lottie
yes
lottie
that
s
the
name
i
believe
by
the
by
a
very
pretty
name
for
a
pretty
girl
when
the
doctor
closed
the
door
behind
him
as
he
passed
out
i
began
to
arrange
my
baggage
while
lottie
s
dear
image
floated
before
my
mind
and
my
heart
fluttered
with
excitement
when
i
thought
of
the
great
pleasure
it
would
afford
me
to
be
with
her
once
more
i
was
at
the
depot
twenty
minutes
ahead
of
time
and
impatient
and
nervous
so
much
excited
that
i
could
not
sit
five
minutes
in
one
place
i
think
my
pulse
must
have
counted
at
least
ninety
to
the
minute
i
snatched
up
a
newspaper
and
tried
to
read
but
couldn
t
do
it
looked
at
my
watch
a
dozen
times
compared
it
with
the
railway
clock
as
often
then
began
to
notice
the
crowd
of
travelers
as
they
came
hurrying
in
hoping
to
see
dabbs
among
them
but
he
did
not
arrive
until
the
conductor
cried
all
aboard
when
i
saw
him
elbowing
his
way
through
the
crowd
i
was
afraid
you
would
be
left
dabbs
i
said
as
he
came
up
never
was
left
in
my
life
sir
don
t
think
of
me
at
all
i
m
one
of
those
kind
of
fellows
that
ain
t
left
i
know
the
value
of
time
sir
have
been
dispatching
instructions
to
tadpoddle
he
s
got
em
before
now
good
we
re
i
found
it
a
great
relief
to
my
restless
mind
to
be
with
dabbs
for
he
was
an
incessant
talker
well
posted
on
general
subjects
and
appeared
to
be
willing
to
impart
what
he
knew
without
any
questions
from
me
he
gave
me
an
interesting
history
of
many
notorious
criminals
whose
dark
deeds
had
been
brought
to
light
by
him
as
a
detective
officer
i
would
interest
you
with
a
repetition
of
them
here
but
my
business
is
to
describe
occurrences
more
directly
connected
with
my
story
i
will
therefore
read
you
harry
s
letter
as
i
think
it
will
throw
more
light
on
the
matter
now
in
hand
than
anything
i
could
say
here
it
is
dear
ed
come
home
as
quickly
as
you
can
we
are
all
in
the
deepest
distress
a
great
misfortune
has
fallen
on
us
and
we
need
you
here
to
help
us
poor
lottie
is
in
great
sorrow
and
your
presence
may
help
to
console
her
i
beseech
you
not
to
lose
a
moment
in
coming
viola
is
in
jail
charged
with
the
murder
of
her
little
brother
oh
it
is
horrible
to
think
that
poor
girl
should
be
thrust
into
a
dungeon
like
a
common
murderer
when
she
is
as
innocent
as
a
lamb
the
very
thought
makes
the
blood
run
cold
in
my
veins
my
conscience
tells
me
that
i
am
responsible
to
some
extent
for
this
terrible
calamity
though
not
intentionally
the
bare
idea
that
viola
would
commit
such
a
foul
cruel
murder
is
preposterous
if
every
man
woman
and
child
in
the
city
of
memphis
were
to
swear
she
is
guilty
i
would
believe
they
were
mistaken
some
awful
mystery
some
scheme
of
villainy
has
mixed
itself
up
with
the
whole
affair
and
i
mean
to
devote
my
life
to
the
task
of
unearthing
it
i
have
registered
a
solemn
vow
in
heaven
never
to
seek
rest
until
the
perpetrator
of
this
horrible
crime
is
brought
to
justice
that
the
poor
child
has
been
cruelly
murdered
by
some
treacherous
cowardly
villain
is
a
fact
beyond
all
dispute
but
the
perpetrator
has
covered
up
his
tracks
so
effectually
that
i
fear
we
shall
have
no
little
difficulty
in
catching
him
i
love
viola
and
since
this
trouble
has
come
upon
her
i
love
her
more
than
ever
i
hate
to
use
extravagant
language
but
the
circumstances
will
justify
it
i
pray
god
to
give
me
courage
strength
and
prudence
until
i
shall
have
unraveled
this
strange
mystery
i
must
confess
that
the
evidence
points
directly
to
viola
as
the
perpetrator
of
this
unnatural
murder
and
there
is
where
the
mystery
comes
in
i
happen
to
know
that
she
loved
her
little
brother
devotedly
and
instead
of
killing
him
i
believe
she
would
have
given
up
her
own
life
to
save
his
she
is
an
angel
in
gentleness
as
pure
as
diana
and
i
would
stake
my
life
and
all
my
hopes
of
salvation
on
her
innocence
yet
many
people
believe
her
guilty
the
poor
child
was
murdered
by
poison
administered
in
his
medicine
the
examination
developed
this
fact
so
as
to
place
it
beyond
question
large
quantities
of
strychnine
being
found
in
the
stomach
i
was
led
to
hope
that
the
evidence
would
establish
the
fact
that
the
poison
had
been
administered
by
mistake
but
that
hope
was
extinguished
when
doctor
dodson
made
his
statement
the
child
had
been
suffering
with
chills
and
fever
for
several
days
and
doctor
dodson
was
called
in
to
take
charge
of
the
case
he
left
five
small
doses
of
quinine
with
viola
directing
her
to
administer
one
dose
every
two
hours
commencing
at
four
o
clock
the
quinine
was
wrapped
in
small
slips
of
blue
paper
and
the
bottle
out
of
which
the
doctor
took
it
was
found
setting
on
the
mantel
where
he
had
placed
it
when
he
measured
out
the
quantity
to
be
given
the
patient
and
after
the
child
was
dead
two
of
the
doses
of
quinine
which
the
doctor
had
made
up
were
found
on
the
table
by
the
bedside
which
upon
examination
were
found
to
be
unmixed
with
any
poison
that
of
course
destroyed
the
theory
that
strychnine
had
been
administered
by
mistake
viola
says
that
she
gave
the
child
three
doses
of
the
medicine
commencing
promptly
at
four
o
clock
as
instructed
by
the
doctor
and
that
soon
after
she
gave
him
the
third
dose
he
began
to
complain
of
a
burning
in
his
stomach
which
continued
to
grow
worse
until
she
became
alarmed
and
called
a
servant
to
go
after
doctor
dodson
the
servant
was
gone
a
long
time
and
when
he
returned
said
that
he
had
been
unable
to
find
the
doctor
that
he
had
been
called
to
see
a
patient
and
no
one
could
tell
when
he
would
be
back
by
this
time
the
child
was
in
convulsions
ragland
and
his
wife
were
at
the
theatre
and
no
other
persons
were
on
the
premises
except
the
servants
one
of
whom
was
dispatched
with
instructions
to
bring
the
first
physician
he
could
find
while
another
was
sent
to
the
theatre
after
ragland
the
servant
who
had
been
sent
for
a
doctor
returned
in
about
an
hour
accompanied
by
doctor
plaxico
it
was
ten
minutes
after
ten
when
the
doctor
arrived
and
he
found
the
child
in
a
dying
condition
ragland
and
his
wife
reached
home
a
few
minutes
before
the
doctor
the
child
expired
at
he
had
been
dead
twenty
minutes
when
doctor
dodson
came
in
completely
overwhelmed
with
astonishment
at
finding
his
patient
dead
doctor
plaxico
requested
doctor
dodson
to
grant
him
a
private
interview
and
they
went
into
another
room
when
doctor
plaxico
closed
the
door
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
and
made
a
cautious
survey
of
the
room
to
assure
himself
that
they
were
alone
then
approaching
doctor
dodson
he
spoke
in
a
low
cautious
tone
as
if
measuring
every
word
he
uttered
the
poor
child
has
been
murdered
as
sure
as
god
is
on
his
merciful
heavens
doctor
plaxico
don
t
tell
me
that
exclaimed
doctor
dodson
as
he
staggered
to
a
sofa
i
tell
you
the
truth
and
nothing
but
what
i
know
to
be
truth
would
to
heaven
it
were
not
so
but
the
evidence
is
overwhelming
that
boy
died
from
the
effects
of
poison
administered
to
him
by
some
one
in
this
very
house
this
very
night
i
know
what
i
say
and
mean
what
i
stop
plaxico
stop
i
implore
you
you
don
t
know
what
you
are
saying
you
have
been
taking
no
you
are
wrong
there
not
a
drop
have
i
tasted
within
the
last
hours
my
brain
was
never
more
clear
than
it
is
this
moment
and
again
i
tell
you
the
child
has
been
murdered
don
t
say
it
takes
malice
to
constitute
murder
who
could
bear
malice
against
an
innocent
little
boy
like
him
does
the
highwayman
bear
malice
against
the
poor
traveler
when
he
kills
him
for
his
money
but
who
gets
any
money
by
the
death
of
this
poor
child
the
very
one
who
administered
the
tis
untrue
and
who
utters
it
is
an
idiot
keep
calm
doctor
dodson
i
beseech
you
i
can
forgive
your
strong
language
knowing
as
i
do
that
you
will
soon
be
sorry
for
having
used
it
but
you
will
be
of
my
opinion
as
to
this
case
before
long
we
must
make
an
autopsy
and
then
you
will
doubtless
be
convinced
that
the
child
has
been
dosed
to
death
with
doctor
dodson
leaned
back
on
the
sofa
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
and
groaned
after
remaining
silent
for
a
long
time
endeavoring
to
collect
his
thoughts
he
said
what
evidence
have
you
that
causes
you
to
conclude
the
child
has
been
poisoned
having
seen
several
persons
die
from
its
effects
and
seeing
the
boy
die
from
it
this
very
night
i
knew
it
was
poison
as
soon
as
i
arrived
and
might
have
saved
him
if
i
had
been
here
an
hour
sooner
but
it
was
too
late
when
i
is
that
all
your
evidence
no
no
not
by
any
means
i
have
found
something
which
i
guess
will
startle
you
when
you
see
it
look
at
that
and
tell
me
if
you
know
what
it
is
of
course
that
is
a
small
phial
of
strychnine
but
what
does
that
signify
will
you
please
tell
me
i
found
this
in
a
little
drawer
of
a
bureau
in
miss
bramlett
s
room
her
brother
died
from
the
effects
of
poison
and
she
was
ordered
by
you
to
administer
quinine
to
her
brother
but
she
administered
something
else
do
i
speak
sufficiently
plain
do
you
understand
me
shall
i
say
anything
more
by
way
of
explaining
what
i
mean
hush
hush
for
heaven
s
sake
stop
give
me
time
to
think
how
many
papers
of
the
quinine
had
been
given
to
the
child
when
you
arrived
miss
bramlett
said
that
she
administered
three
doses
and
that
the
last
one
made
her
brother
sick
did
you
find
the
doses
that
had
not
been
given
to
the
patient
i
found
two
papers
on
the
table
near
the
bed
containing
quinine
and
have
them
here
have
you
examined
them
to
see
whether
they
contain
quinine
or
something
else
yes
their
contents
is
pure
unadulterated
you
don
t
mean
to
say
that
you
think
miss
bramlett
has
intentionally
killed
her
brother
but
i
do
mean
to
say
that
very
thing
who
else
could
have
done
it
how
could
it
have
been
a
mistake
didn
t
she
administer
the
medicine
hasn
t
the
boy
died
from
poison
doesn
t
she
make
a
large
fortune
by
his
death
wasn
t
she
alone
with
him
all
the
time
what
was
she
doing
with
this
bottle
of
strychnine
in
her
bureau
all
the
lawyers
in
tennessee
can
t
save
her
neck
plaxico
you
are
crazy
as
a
march
hare
you
don
t
know
what
you
are
talking
about
i
knew
that
girl
when
she
was
a
mere
child
have
known
her
ever
since
and
i
tell
you
she
is
one
of
the
most
amiable
sweet
gentle
pure
girls
in
the
world
she
doted
on
her
little
brother
and
it
is
absurd
to
say
that
she
has
murdered
him
as
for
money
she
despises
it
and
has
been
squandering
it
by
thousands
among
the
worthy
poor
of
the
city
i
think
the
best
policy
for
you
to
pursue
is
to
keep
your
absurd
opinions
to
yourself
the
poor
girl
has
plenty
of
sorrow
to
endure
without
your
help
to
increase
doctor
plaxico
began
to
pace
the
floor
rapidly
after
a
few
minutes
spent
in
that
way
he
squared
himself
in
front
of
doctor
dodson
and
looking
him
earnestly
in
the
face
for
several
seconds
in
silence
he
said
dodson
i
have
many
faults
i
know
faults
of
which
i
am
heartily
ashamed
i
have
a
weakness
when
it
comes
to
wine
and
other
stimulants
but
i
profess
to
be
an
honest
christian
gentleman
a
man
if
you
please
and
i
can
not
get
the
consent
of
my
conscience
to
let
this
matter
drop
here
as
i
am
a
living
man
i
believe
that
child
has
been
murdered
most
cruelly
deprived
of
his
young
life
by
his
unnatural
heartless
sister
oh
sir
my
heart
grows
faint
when
i
think
of
it
she
whose
duty
it
was
to
love
and
guard
that
young
life
has
slipped
in
instead
like
a
thief
and
stolen
it
of
all
the
crimes
that
ever
were
committed
this
one
appears
to
me
to
be
the
blackest
the
most
cowardly
and
damnable
is
it
not
possible
that
you
may
be
mistaken
after
all
as
to
the
cause
of
the
child
s
death
not
at
all
the
symptoms
were
unmistakable
and
what
course
do
you
mean
to
pursue
in
regard
to
the
case
notify
the
coroner
of
course
have
an
inquest
make
an
autopsy
lay
the
evidence
before
the
civil
authorities
and
then
let
the
law
take
its
be
it
so
then
and
i
pray
god
to
give
that
poor
girl
strength
to
endure
this
great
calamity
for
of
her
purity
and
innocence
i
have
no
doubt
whatever
and
you
will
some
day
regret
the
share
you
had
in
bringing
this
suspicion
down
on
i
never
shall
regret
doing
what
is
my
plain
duty
though
i
shall
be
more
than
delighted
if
it
can
appear
that
she
is
innocent
but
i
beg
to
say
that
i
think
you
do
me
injustice
when
you
speak
of
my
bringing
the
suspicion
down
on
her
it
rather
seems
to
me
that
the
circumstances
are
responsible
for
doing
that
and
not
one
question
i
forgot
to
ask
have
you
said
anything
to
miss
bramlett
about
the
phial
of
strychnine
which
you
say
you
found
in
her
bureau
drawer
no
i
did
not
nor
have
i
mentioned
it
to
any
one
but
you
and
ragland
know
nothing
whatever
about
my
wouldn
t
it
be
advisable
not
to
mention
your
suspicions
until
after
the
autopsy
probably
it
would
if
you
advise
that
course
i
shall
gladly
be
it
so
then
let
the
coroner
be
notified
at
i
was
soundly
sleeping
in
my
bed
when
a
messenger
from
doctor
dodson
came
thundering
at
my
door
demanding
admittance
before
i
was
fully
awake
he
informed
me
that
the
doctor
wanted
to
see
me
as
soon
as
i
could
come
to
his
office
the
messenger
said
that
something
serious
must
have
happened
for
he
never
had
seen
the
doctor
looking
so
nervous
and
unhappy
as
soon
as
i
could
dress
myself
i
hastened
to
the
office
the
night
was
very
dark
the
streets
swimming
in
mud
the
dim
lamps
at
the
corners
cast
a
pale
sickly
light
over
the
pavement
my
made
a
loud
lonely
sound
as
they
struck
the
hard
stones
while
the
messenger
walked
quietly
behind
me
my
mind
was
in
a
fit
condition
to
anticipate
coming
evil
and
strange
as
you
may
think
it
i
felt
sure
that
something
awful
had
happened
and
that
viola
was
in
some
way
mixed
up
with
it
the
messenger
had
by
no
means
exaggerated
in
his
description
of
doctor
dodson
s
excitement
i
never
had
seen
him
in
such
a
state
of
agitation
as
i
found
him
when
i
reached
his
office
he
hurriedly
gave
me
the
details
of
what
had
occurred
in
substance
as
i
have
given
them
to
you
and
i
was
astonished
at
the
coolness
with
which
i
listened
to
the
horrible
narrative
but
i
believe
i
have
become
callous
and
perhaps
it
is
best
for
me
to
be
so
as
it
will
enable
me
to
do
the
work
before
me
with
the
deliberation
that
is
so
necessary
doctor
dodson
heaven
bless
him
agrees
with
me
in
the
opinion
that
viola
is
innocent
and
will
aid
me
in
establishing
it
before
the
world
the
first
thing
i
did
was
to
inform
lottie
of
what
had
happened
and
send
her
to
stay
with
viola
in
order
to
sustain
her
as
much
as
possible
under
this
great
affliction
lottie
is
in
great
distress
but
is
a
perfect
little
heroine
and
has
been
with
viola
ever
since
the
troubles
commenced
indefatigable
in
her
efforts
to
comfort
and
encourage
her
the
next
step
was
to
see
the
newspaper
managers
and
induce
them
not
to
mention
the
matter
in
the
papers
i
had
a
double
object
in
view
in
that
respect
in
the
first
place
i
wanted
to
keep
viola
s
name
out
of
public
print
my
next
motive
was
to
keep
everything
as
private
as
possible
in
order
to
let
the
detectives
have
a
better
chance
to
work
up
the
case
doctor
dodson
went
to
see
the
coroner
who
is
a
good
friend
of
his
and
that
officer
agreed
that
the
inquest
might
be
held
privately
doctors
dodson
and
plaxico
made
a
examination
when
the
evidences
of
poison
were
unmistakable
the
inquest
was
held
in
ragland
s
house
and
only
a
few
witnesses
were
examined
the
verdict
of
the
jury
would
have
been
different
no
doubt
but
for
the
phial
of
strychnine
found
in
viola
s
bureau
drawer
and
what
is
most
singular
and
unaccountable
to
me
is
that
viola
acknowledges
she
purchased
the
strychnine
but
refuses
to
tell
for
what
purpose
that
circumstance
alone
caused
the
jury
to
render
a
verdict
implicating
her
here
is
the
exact
wording
of
the
verdict
after
going
on
with
the
ordinary
formalities
and
recitations
as
to
dates
venue
etc
we
the
jury
do
find
that
harry
bramlett
whose
body
now
lies
before
us
died
from
the
effects
of
poison
administered
to
him
by
miss
viola
i
was
present
when
the
verdict
was
rendered
and
i
did
not
faint
in
fact
you
would
have
been
surprised
to
see
how
calmly
i
received
the
awful
news
that
i
knew
would
consign
viola
to
the
walls
of
a
dungeon
i
could
not
account
for
my
calmness
unless
it
was
produced
by
hopeless
despair
yet
i
am
by
no
means
hopeless
for
i
tell
you
eddie
as
certain
as
there
is
a
god
viola
is
innocent
and
i
mean
to
prove
it
she
knows
something
more
than
she
is
willing
to
tell
but
i
will
yet
influence
her
to
tell
all
she
has
sustained
herself
remarkably
well
through
the
trying
ordeal
but
there
appears
to
be
a
callousness
in
her
manner
that
frightens
me
she
seems
to
be
indifferent
as
to
her
fate
says
she
don
t
wish
to
live
but
i
hope
she
will
be
better
as
soon
as
the
excitement
passes
off
bring
with
you
one
of
the
most
experienced
detectives
you
can
find
in
philadelphia
don
t
mind
the
cost
i
have
but
little
money
myself
but
my
friends
will
aid
me
come
without
a
moment
s
delay
i
have
taken
the
precaution
to
have
the
premises
closely
guarded
in
order
to
let
the
detectives
have
a
fair
chance
to
investigate
the
case
everything
in
the
two
rooms
occupied
by
viola
and
her
brother
remains
just
as
it
was
when
the
child
died
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
a
skillful
detective
will
be
able
to
unearth
something
that
will
explain
the
whole
matter
i
think
i
could
put
my
finger
on
the
guilty
party
in
ten
minutes
but
what
good
would
that
do
unless
i
could
prove
it
if
my
suspicions
prove
to
be
well
founded
i
shall
raise
a
whirlwind
here
that
will
startle
some
people
who
feel
very
secure
now
i
will
not
breathe
my
suspicions
to
any
one
until
i
am
able
to
confirm
them
i
believe
i
am
becoming
superstitious
for
there
seems
to
be
an
invisible
influence
at
work
upon
me
it
is
the
same
feeling
that
told
me
to
ride
on
the
pilot
of
the
engine
when
i
saved
viola
s
life
that
same
something
tells
me
that
i
will
again
save
her
and
that
she
will
be
my
wife
but
this
letter
is
too
long
anyway
and
i
will
sign
the
name
of
yours
truly
chapter
xv
when
i
arrived
at
memphis
i
of
course
meant
to
see
lottie
before
any
one
else
but
in
going
to
rockland
s
residence
i
had
to
pass
harry
s
office
i
hurried
in
to
see
him
a
moment
and
to
inquire
about
the
dear
one
i
was
so
anxious
to
see
how
is
lottie
were
the
first
words
i
uttered
she
is
well
said
harry
but
of
course
anxious
to
see
where
will
i
find
her
she
is
at
the
jail
with
viola
where
she
spends
most
of
the
time
the
truth
of
it
is
lottie
has
got
more
sense
than
all
of
us
put
together
she
has
exhibited
more
true
courage
and
prudence
in
this
late
trouble
than
any
one
of
us
who
is
this
gentleman
with
you
oh
yes
i
beg
pardon
harry
i
forgot
to
introduce
dabbs
wallingford
dabbs
he
belongs
to
the
detective
service
and
has
come
to
assist
us
in
this
unfortunate
i
am
glad
to
see
you
here
dabbs
said
harry
offering
him
a
seat
this
is
a
most
distressing
affair
and
i
hope
you
will
go
to
work
at
once
as
to
money
i
beg
you
to
understand
that
it
is
no
object
in
this
case
you
shall
have
what
you
want
i
hope
you
will
be
able
to
unravel
this
most
singular
i
shall
endeavor
to
do
so
sir
and
i
must
request
you
not
to
let
any
one
know
that
you
have
engaged
my
services
we
must
act
with
great
caution
these
kind
of
cases
are
often
found
rather
complicated
and
difficult
to
manage
i
have
an
old
friend
here
who
has
been
for
many
years
engaged
in
the
detective
service
perhaps
you
may
know
him
tadpoddle
no
i
am
not
acquainted
with
well
he
s
a
sharp
fellow
i
ll
go
look
him
up
and
we
ll
commence
business
at
once
it
will
be
necessary
wallingford
for
us
to
meet
occasionally
where
shall
i
find
you
when
i
want
to
communicate
with
you
here
at
my
office
you
can
come
in
the
back
way
and
enter
the
inner
room
where
no
one
will
disturb
all
right
then
you
shall
hear
from
me
soon
good
morning
sir
and
dabbs
went
out
what
a
man
he
is
eddie
yes
but
they
say
he
is
the
most
skillful
detective
that
ever
operated
in
well
if
that
is
so
i
must
say
he
belies
his
come
harry
i
must
see
lottie
i
can
not
stop
to
talk
wait
a
moment
till
i
close
the
office
and
i
will
go
with
don
t
walk
so
fast
ed
said
harry
when
we
started
toward
the
jail
i
can
t
keep
up
with
you
i
know
you
want
to
see
lottie
but
you
need
not
go
like
a
i
was
compelled
to
slacken
my
pace
much
against
my
will
for
i
wanted
to
fly
to
her
who
was
more
dear
to
me
than
all
the
world
contained
have
you
made
any
new
discoveries
about
the
poisoning
since
you
wrote
me
nothing
definite
but
we
think
we
will
be
able
to
strike
a
track
soon
there
have
been
strange
doings
at
ragland
s
how
does
viola
bear
her
trouble
ah
ed
there
is
the
thing
that
puzzles
me
she
acts
so
strangely
in
the
matter
i
can
t
understand
her
she
knows
something
about
this
business
that
she
will
not
tell
though
she
has
promised
to
explain
all
when
her
mind
gets
more
is
your
confidence
in
her
innocence
still
unshaken
i
was
truly
sorry
i
had
asked
the
question
when
harry
s
eyes
met
mine
how
can
you
ask
me
such
a
question
when
you
are
so
well
aware
of
the
confidence
i
have
in
that
dear
girl
don
t
you
know
how
i
love
her
don
t
you
know
i
would
as
soon
suspect
an
angel
from
heaven
as
viola
i
was
not
surprised
at
the
extravagant
language
used
because
i
was
in
love
myself
and
knew
how
harry
felt
i
had
not
walked
more
than
three
steps
on
the
jail
floor
when
i
heard
lottie
s
voice
exclaim
that
s
eddie
i
know
his
walk
and
in
a
moment
her
darling
head
was
on
my
shoulder
while
her
tears
of
joy
fell
on
my
breast
eddie
i
am
so
glad
you
have
come
back
to
help
us
out
of
our
great
troubles
we
have
been
looking
for
you
anxiously
and
the
moment
i
heard
your
step
i
knew
whose
it
my
heart
was
so
full
of
joy
that
i
could
not
speak
for
some
moments
come
ed
said
harry
you
are
making
a
simpleton
of
yourself
about
lottie
leave
her
and
come
with
me
we
must
go
to
viola
how
is
she
sister
improving
some
little
i
think
though
she
can
t
shed
tears
if
she
could
only
have
a
good
hearty
cry
and
shed
some
tears
i
believe
it
would
do
her
a
great
deal
of
good
there
is
a
settled
look
of
hopeless
despair
on
her
face
that
frightens
does
she
talk
much
no
she
scarcely
ever
says
a
word
except
to
answer
questions
i
have
tried
every
way
i
could
think
of
to
lead
her
into
conversation
but
without
success
she
eats
scarcely
enough
to
sustain
life
though
she
ate
more
at
breakfast
this
morning
than
at
any
one
time
since
she
has
been
go
in
lottie
and
ask
her
if
she
will
receive
a
visit
from
edward
and
lottie
returned
in
a
few
moments
and
informed
us
that
viola
would
receive
us
when
i
told
her
that
you
and
eddie
wanted
to
come
in
to
see
her
i
was
delighted
to
see
her
face
brighten
up
and
she
spoke
so
quickly
and
said
she
would
be
delighted
to
see
you
i
think
it
is
a
favorable
sign
it
is
the
first
time
she
has
manifested
the
least
interest
about
anything
since
she
has
been
i
was
prepared
to
see
a
great
change
in
viola
s
appearance
but
not
for
such
a
one
as
it
was
her
face
was
as
white
as
marble
and
i
never
had
seen
such
a
look
of
anguish
as
was
fixed
on
her
countenance
she
rose
as
we
entered
and
offered
me
her
hand
it
was
as
cold
as
a
lump
of
ice
how
is
your
health
miss
bramlett
i
inquired
very
good
i
thank
you
was
the
faint
reply
i
never
was
so
embarrassed
in
my
life
and
harry
poor
fellow
stood
like
a
statue
unable
to
aid
me
he
was
more
confused
than
i
was
lottie
however
came
to
my
assistance
promptly
sit
down
eddie
sit
down
brother
and
let
us
talk
over
old
times
while
viola
and
i
are
at
work
here
viola
hold
the
hank
while
i
wind
the
thread
on
this
viola
moved
her
seat
so
as
to
face
lottie
and
held
out
her
little
white
hands
to
receive
the
hank
there
now
eddie
you
sit
on
this
side
so
i
can
look
at
you
while
i
work
you
have
been
away
so
long
i
have
almost
forgotten
how
you
look
i
declare
you
look
much
better
than
you
did
when
you
went
away
don
t
you
think
he
does
viola
yes
she
replied
sadly
i
was
delighted
at
lottie
s
skill
in
maneuvering
to
divert
viola
and
lead
her
into
conversation
it
was
a
clever
piece
of
strategy
and
to
some
extent
succeeded
the
jailer
was
an
old
of
harry
s
and
this
proved
to
be
a
fortunate
circumstance
as
it
enabled
us
to
secure
for
viola
a
large
room
well
lighted
and
ventilated
harry
had
caused
the
floor
to
be
covered
with
a
costly
carpet
of
the
most
exquisite
texture
and
heavy
damask
curtains
hung
over
the
windows
then
over
the
damask
were
hung
others
of
lace
a
bureau
wardrobe
and
bedstead
of
polished
rosewood
gave
the
room
a
cozy
appearance
while
a
sofa
with
red
silk
cushions
seemed
to
invite
the
weary
body
to
lie
down
and
rest
on
the
bureau
sat
two
large
china
vases
both
filled
with
choice
flowers
one
with
soft
velvet
cushions
and
two
common
cane
bottom
chairs
constituted
the
furniture
that
harry
had
caused
to
be
put
in
the
room
he
had
even
had
a
costly
curtain
hung
over
the
heavy
iron
door
in
order
to
hide
from
viola
s
sight
everything
calculated
to
remind
her
that
she
was
a
prisoner
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
on
the
inside
of
the
room
that
looked
like
the
walls
of
a
prison
but
it
was
more
like
a
sleeping
apartment
lottie
had
been
no
less
thoughtful
than
her
brother
of
viola
s
comfort
for
she
had
brought
old
roderick
to
the
jail
and
that
chatty
bird
usually
made
things
lively
wherever
he
went
a
pair
of
canaries
occasionally
enlivened
the
room
with
a
song
from
the
little
cage
that
sat
on
the
top
of
the
wardrobe
all
these
pets
had
been
brought
there
by
lottie
harry
said
lottie
you
come
and
finish
winding
this
thread
while
i
go
and
see
about
dinner
we
are
going
to
have
a
real
dinner
mind
you
don
t
tangle
my
thread
viola
as
soon
as
you
get
through
with
that
hank
you
ll
find
three
more
in
my
basket
i
want
you
to
hold
them
while
harry
winds
them
off
will
you
dear
yes
lottie
was
the
soft
reply
lottie
loves
ed
lottie
loves
ed
here
we
come
lottie
screamed
old
roderick
who
was
peeping
down
from
the
top
of
the
wardrobe
hush
up
you
old
tattler
you
needn
t
tell
all
my
secrets
before
company
said
lottie
and
taking
me
by
the
arm
come
you
must
go
and
help
me
get
dinner
we
don
t
uphold
any
idleness
i
divined
her
object
and
followed
her
from
the
room
as
it
was
evident
she
wanted
to
leave
harry
and
viola
alone
you
are
the
sweetest
darling
in
the
whole
world
lottie
said
i
you
can
think
of
so
many
ways
to
make
people
comfortable
and
i
am
truly
glad
you
think
so
i
am
always
happy
when
you
are
pleased
with
you
will
always
be
happy
then
for
i
am
always
pleased
with
do
you
think
harry
and
viola
will
ever
make
matters
up
and
be
as
they
were
in
the
good
old
days
yes
certainly
i
do
harry
s
pride
has
undergone
considerable
shrinkage
since
viola
s
troubles
commenced
and
i
think
he
will
be
glad
to
come
down
from
his
lofty
you
must
put
your
wits
to
work
eddie
so
as
to
help
me
bring
them
to
an
understanding
i
am
going
to
have
dinner
served
in
viola
s
room
and
you
must
assist
in
keeping
up
the
conversation
and
not
sit
there
looking
as
if
you
had
a
over
your
mouth
as
you
did
a
while
ago
but
try
to
invent
something
to
talk
about
now
come
along
and
i
ll
put
you
to
work
and
she
led
me
to
the
steward
s
headquarters
mr
toddleburg
said
lottie
i
want
you
to
help
me
get
a
good
dinner
to
be
served
in
miss
bramlett
s
room

it
how
could
anybody
refuse
to
do
anything
when
requested
by
miss
wallingford
thank
you
thank
you
toddleburg
you
are
very
as
lottie
passed
on
and
entered
the
the
little
man
said
to
me
that

the
prettiest
young
lady
i
ever
saw
sir
and
she
is
as
good
as
she
is
pretty
i
ll
do

to
please

t
you

i
mean
to
put
you
to
work
you

not
be
idle
here
take
those
eggs
and
break
them
in
that
bowl
and

them
well
while
i
get
some
flour
and
sugar
i
am
going
to
teach
you
how
to
make
a
real
nice
i
broke
the
eggs
as
she
directed
and
began
to
beat
them
very
awkwardly
while
i
watched
her
beautiful
form
moving
about
like
a
fairy
her
sleeves
rolled
up
exposing
to
view
the
prettiest
pair
of
round
plump
white
arms
that
any
man
ever
saw
by
the
time
i
had
finished
beating
the
eggs
she
was
measuring
the
flour
into
a
tray
there
now
said
i
my
job

i
think
i
have
earned
a
kiss
and
i
demand

to
you
i
reckon
i
suppose
i
must
be
kind
to
my
old
thief
as
he
has
been
away
so
then
she
approached
me
with
her
hands
covered
with
flour
and
held
up
her
pretty
lips
to
receive
my
kiss
there
now

and
grind
some
spice

a
hurry

shall
need
it
i
obeyed
orders
and
ground
the
spice
now
go
and
tell
the
steward
to
have
a
small
table
carried
to
viola
s
room
and
a
nice
white
cloth
spread
on
it
get
four
plates
four
napkins
four
goblets
and
everything
necessary
for
four
distinguished
i
went
to
the
steward
and
he
assisted
in
arranging
the
dinner
table
as
lottie
had
directed
this
was
the
first
time
i
had
helped
her
to
prepare
a
dinner
since
the
old
days
of
our
tramphood
and
it
naturally
caused
my
mind
to
stray
back
to
those
happy
hours
making
me
forget
the
great
troubles
by
which
we
then
were
surrounded
as
soon
as
i
had
finished
executing
lottie
s
orders
i
in
the
where
i
found
her
very
busy
with
the
preparation
of
the
dinner
how
are
they
getting
on
eddie
how
is
who
getting
on
why
harry
and
viola
of
oh
they
are
getting
on
splendidly
i
judge
from
the
appearance
of
things
the
hanks
were
terribly
tousled
the
balls
all
scattered
about
on
the
floor
and
viola
s
cheeks
showed
a
little
crimson
tinge
in
fact
she
blushed
perceptibly
as
i
entered
the
room
would
you
not
say
that
was
a
favorable
omen
the
very
best
in
the
that
was
a
skillful
maneuver
lottie
to
put
them
to
winding
yarn
nothing
could
have
been
i
thought
so
because
if
we
can
get
them
to
talking
freely
all
will
come
they
were
conversing
when
i
went
in
and
viola
dropped
the
yarn
on
the
ah
if
we
can
just
control
harry
we
shall
all
be
happy
once
more
if
viola
would
only
tell
what
she
knows
about
the
death
of
her
brother
harry
would
be
able
to
establish
her
innocence
and
take
her
out
of
prison
she
of
course
can
never
be
happy
while
this
dreadful
suspicion
hangs
over
what
is
it
that
you
think
she
knows
and
refuses
to
tell
oh
don
t
ask
me
to
tell
you
what
i
know
i
am
somewhat
of
a
detective
myself
and
i
ll
have
you
know
that
i
can
see
into
a
as
deeply
as
anybody
you
shall
hear
from
me
at
the
proper
time
the
murderer
of
that
poor
little
boy
is
not
in
this
jail
by
a
long
what
on
earth
do
you
mean
do
you
know
who
is
the
guilty
party
i
would
stake
my
life
on
if
you
know
who
committed
that
cruel
murder
why
do
you
allow
this
poor
girl
to
remain
in
jail
ah
there
s
the
rub
we
must
be
able
to
make
the
proof
before
we
flush
the
have
you
mentioned
to
harry
anything
on
this
subject
not
a
word
he
was
so
much
excited
i
was
afraid
he
would
commit
some
foolish
blunder
and
spoil
lottie
do
you
know
i
think
you
are
the
most
sensible
prudent
girl
that
ever
lived
i
wish
harry
had
half
the
prudence
you
have
he
has
plenty
of
good
sense
but
he
is
so
impetuous
so
proud
and
unyielding
he
never
was
that
way
until
viola
came
from
new
york
to
spend
the
winter
with
me
he
loved
her
devotedly
and
thought
it
would
be
dishonorable
to
marry
her
while
she
was
so
rich
and
he
so
poor
if
we
can
get
them
reconciled
and
induce
him
to
propose
to
her
then
we
shall
soon
be
able
to
extricate
her
from
this
unpleasant
situation
did
you
know
i
have
been
afraid
that
viola
contemplated
suicide
no
i
had
no
idea
of
such
a
well
i
have
been
afraid
of
it
ever
since
harry
was
so
ill
and
if
he
had
died
it
is
my
opinion
that
she
would
not
have
survived
him
an
what
circumstance
led
you
to
believe
that
oh
don
t
be
so
inquisitive
i
am
not
going
to
tell
you
all
my
secrets
go
on
about
your
business
now
i
am
done
with
you
until
dinner
is
i
reluctantly
obeyed
and
returned
to
viola
s
room
where
i
was
overjoyed
to
find
harry
and
her
engaged
in
earnest
conversation
in
an
undertone
i
was
a
little
sorry
however
when
i
saw
that
i
had
unfortunately
interrupted
a
conversation
in
which
they
both
seemed
to
be
deeply
interested
and
i
gathered
up
a
few
stray
flowers
that
were
scattered
about
the
bureau
top
and
immediately
left
the
room
making
it
appear
that
i
had
merely
come
in
after
the
flowers
they
are
all
right
said
i
to
lottie
as
i
entered
the
i
surprised
them
in
the
midst
of
an
earnest
conversation
and
they
were
both
very
much
flurried
but
i
hastened
to
pick
up
these
flowers
and
leave
the
did
you
learn
what
they
were
talking
about
i
heard
harry
tell
one
truth
if
he
never
tells
what
was
it
he
said
viola
i
know
i
have
acted
the
fool
and
i
pray
you
to
forgive
me
and
what
did
she
say
in
reply
i
entered
the
room
just
then
but
i
saw
from
her
looks
that
she
was
going
to
forgive
how
unfortunate
it
was
that
you
happened
in
at
such
a
well
didn
t
you
order
me
to
go
and
don
t
you
know
i
obeyed
with
reluctance
oh
bother
your
obedience
you
are
mighty
good
to
obey
orders
when
you
want
to
but
i
suppose
i
must
forgive
you
and
let
you
stay
here
though
you
shall
not
be
idle
set
that
pan
on
the
stove
there
and
fill
it
with
water
then
take
the
other
one
off
and
wipe
it
dry
with
a
napkin
and
put
it
back
don
t
spill
water
on
the
other
things
i
think
i
shall
make
an
excellent
cook
of
you
one
of
these
you
can
make
anything
of
me
because
you
are
such
a
darling
i
couldn
t
make
a
flatterer
of
you
nature
has
taken
the
job
off
my
i
wish
nature
had
furnished
me
with
some
strong
language
so
i
could
tell
my
lottie
how
dearly
i
love
look
at
you
now
you
are
dropping
the
water
in
that
bowl
oh
i
ask
pardon
i
didn
t
see
we
delayed
dinner
until
late
in
the
afternoon
in
order
to
afford
harry
and
viola
an
opportunity
to
come
to
an
understanding
and
we
had
reason
to
believe
that
what
we
so
much
desired
had
taken
place
lottie
and
i
brought
the
dinner
in
and
when
it
was
ready
she
managed
to
seat
viola
and
harry
on
the
same
side
of
the
table
and
she
and
i
sat
at
the
other
now
viola
said
lottie
i
have
made
you
some
of
your
favorite
soup
i
know
you
will
like
it
and
i
am
sure
it
will
do
you
good
and
shall
be
glad
if
you
will
try
viola
smiled
faintly
it
was
the
first
thing
like
a
smile
that
had
lighted
up
her
pale
face
since
her
brother
s
death
you
are
very
kind
lottie
she
said
and
i
know
i
shall
like
the
soup
i
have
no
appetite
however
but
will
try
some
of
it
to
please
here
are
three
bottles
of
wine
real
grape
juice
take
some
viola
you
ll
find
it
excellent
it
is
the
best
appetizer
in
the
world
the
very
thing
you
need
she
continued
viola
took
a
small
glass
of
the
wine
and
drank
it
what
do
you
think
of
it
it
is
very
good
and
i
think
it
will
help
me
to
regain
my
we
spent
a
couple
of
hours
pleasantly
at
dinner
i
assisted
lottie
in
clearing
the
table
and
then
harry
and
i
took
leave
of
the
young
ladies
promising
to
visit
them
early
next
morning
well
harry
said
i
as
soon
as
we
were
out
of
the
jail
how
stand
matters
between
you
and
viola
oh
we
are
all
right
now
i
tell
me
all
about
ah
eddie
i
have
been
very
foolish
and
i
mean
to
make
all
the
reparation
in
my
power
poor
viola
i
have
caused
her
much
grief
but
i
thought
i
was
acting
right
in
what
i
did
she
has
promised
to
marry
me
when
the
proof
of
her
innocence
can
be
did
she
tell
you
for
what
purpose
she
had
purchased
the
phial
of
strychnine
no
she
positively
refuses
to
do
so
and
i
consider
that
very
unfortunate
because
that
is
the
strongest
point
against
her
i
have
by
no
means
abandoned
the
hope
of
yet
persuading
her
to
reveal
everything
she
knows
about
the
matter
her
mind
is
now
in
a
very
unsettled
condition
and
whose
mind
would
be
otherwise
with
so
much
to
endure
the
only
wonder
is
that
she
has
been
able
to
bear
it
at
when
is
her
case
to
be
tried
it
is
my
opinion
that
she
never
will
be
tried
we
waived
the
preliminary
examination
which
according
to
our
laws
would
have
brought
her
into
a
magistrate
s
court
and
consented
to
let
her
be
remanded
to
jail
until
the
grand
jury
investigates
the
case
i
took
this
course
to
prevent
publicity
and
to
save
viola
the
pain
of
being
compelled
to
appear
at
the
bar
as
a
common
criminal
of
course
she
will
have
to
be
tried
in
open
court
unless
we
can
untangle
the
mystery
in
time
to
convince
the
grand
jury
of
her
innocence
which
i
mean
to
make
a
desperate
effort
to
do
viola
is
in
possession
of
secrets
connected
with
this
matter
which
she
refuses
to
reveal
but
i
am
inclined
to
hope
that
as
soon
as
her
mind
becomes
more
composed
she
will
consent
to
tell
me
did
you
know
that
lottie
is
also
in
possession
of
some
strange
secret
bearing
on
this
case
indeed
i
did
not
pray
what
is
it
she
refuses
to
tell
me
but
says
she
will
do
so
at
the
proper
i
declare
there
is
no
accounting
for
a
woman
s
freaks
if
this
is
not
a
proper
time
to
tell
what
they
know
i
should
like
to
be
informed
when
it
would
i
think
you
are
wrong
there
lottie
you
know
is
a
sensible
girl
possessed
of
great
prudence
and
you
may
rest
assured
she
will
aid
us
at
the
right
moment
she
says
she
knows
who
it
is
that
committed
the
murder
and
that
it
is
a
person
who
never
has
been
why
does
she
refuse
to
tell
us
who
it
is
then
because
the
proof
is
wanting
to
establish
the
fact
by
the
by
harry
have
you
no
suspicions
on
your
mind
as
to
who
perpetrated
the
murder
i
have
but
am
unable
to
offer
any
good
reason
for
it
therefore
i
could
not
think
of
naming
the
person
on
whom
my
suspicions
then
it
appears
to
me
that
there
is
but
very
little
difference
between
the
position
you
occupy
and
the
one
held
by
i
must
say
that
i
can
not
see
it
in
that
light
for
i
understand
you
to
say
lottie
informed
you
that
she
knew
who
committed
the
murder
while
i
say
i
only
have
a
mere
suspicion
as
to
the
well
it
amounts
to
the
same
thing
after
all
because
lottie
i
guess
does
not
really
know
positively
who
is
the
guilty
party
but
we
must
all
get
together
some
day
soon
and
have
a
plain
talk
and
a
better
understanding
we
must
tell
each
other
exactly
what
we
know
and
what
we
think
then
put
our
shoulders
to
the
wheel
and
see
if
we
can
t
make
things
move
in
the
right
i
agree
with
you
there
eddie
because
if
we
fail
in
this
business
i
am
a
ruined
we
are
not
going
to
fail
have
no
fears
on
that
score
but
tell
me
how
it
was
that
you
and
viola
happened
to
make
things
well
i
don
t
mind
telling
you
everything
because
you
are
in
love
yourself
you
i
should
think
i
did
know
very
good
then
i
ll
tell
you
all
about
it
i
wouldn
t
tell
it
to
you
if
you
were
not
head
and
ears
in
love
because
people
who
don
t
love
don
t
understand
such
things
they
sneer
at
the
idea
of
a
true
and
holy
affection
call
it
nonsense
and
all
that
but
you
know
how
it
is
yourself
don
t
you
oh
go
on
i
think
i
well
in
the
first
place
you
know
my
views
in
regard
to
unprincipled
and
that
i
had
registered
a
solemn
vow
that
i
never
would
place
myself
in
a
position
where
such
an
imputation
could
be
laid
upon
me
as
to
that
my
mind
is
unchanged
but
circumstances
have
materially
changed
my
uncle
who
went
to
california
about
the
time
we
came
to
memphis
has
made
a
large
fortune
and
i
have
received
several
letters
from
him
and
i
reckon
i
had
better
show
you
the
last
one
which
came
only
ten
days
ago
here
it
is
dear
harry
i
received
a
long
letter
the
other
day
from
rockland
who
speaks
in
the
highest
praise
of
you
he
said
you
would
soon
be
prepared
to
enter
the
profession
of
law
with
brilliant
prospects
spoke
of
your
moral
character
as
being
and
seems
to
be
very
proud
of
you
the
history
he
gave
of
lottie
was
such
as
to
increase
my
curiosity
to
see
her
he
thinks
she
is
far
superior
to
other
young
ladles
and
his
praise
of
her
beauty
and
gentle
manners
was
most
extravagant
you
can
not
imagine
the
pleasure
it
gave
me
to
hear
such
a
favorable
report
from
my
dear
deceased
sister
s
children
i
presume
you
know
i
am
a
bachelor
such
is
the
case
whether
you
know
it
or
not
and
am
living
a
sad
and
lonely
life
here
i
have
been
very
fortunate
in
the
mining
business
have
accumulated
a
large
fortune
have
no
children
to
inherit
it
no
brothers
or
sisters
in
fact
no
one
to
give
it
to
except
you
and
your
charming
sister
this
being
the
case
you
may
easily
understand
why
rockland
s
favorable
report
gave
me
such
satisfaction
when
one
works
hard
to
make
a
fortune
he
don
t
like
to
leave
it
to
be
squandered
by
unworthy
relatives
it
is
a
source
of
much
gratification
therefore
to
know
that
i
shall
leave
mine
in
the
hands
of
two
such
worthy
children
as
you
and
lottie
i
am
getting
old
now
and
would
like
very
much
to
have
you
and
lottie
with
me
and
should
have
sent
for
you
some
time
ago
but
it
is
my
intention
to
wind
up
my
affairs
here
and
return
to
memphis
if
i
succeed
in
this
i
shall
of
course
expect
you
and
your
charming
sister
to
live
with
me
rockland
says
that
lottie
is
engaged
to
be
married
to
a
very
worthy
young
i
am
much
obliged
to
rockland
for
his
good
hold
on
until
i
finish
the
i
can
not
the
letter
continued
express
the
gratitude
i
feel
toward
rockland
for
his
kindness
to
my
nephew
and
niece
i
own
a
large
interest
in
a
very
rich
mine
here
and
if
i
can
sell
it
for
what
i
think
it
is
worth
i
shall
soon
be
ready
to
make
my
home
permanently
in
memphis
you
will
present
to
rockland
my
warmest
thanks
and
tell
my
charming
niece
that
i
am
looking
forward
with
anxiety
to
the
time
when
i
shall
hold
her
in
my
old
arms
yours
most
truly
oliver
ah
harry
what
a
lucky
fellow
you
are
does
not
the
good
luck
strike
you
too
doesn
t
lottie
get
half
and
don
t
you
get
lottie
and
her
money
too
oh
bother
the
money
my
lottie
is
worth
a
hundred
thousand
such
gold
mines
yes
but
in
my
case
you
see
it
is
different
i
don
t
care
so
much
for
the
money
you
know
but
it
makes
honors
easy
between
viola
and
very
good
now
go
on
and
tell
me
how
you
succeeded
with
i
shall
do
so
cheerfully
because
i
like
to
talk
with
you
about
such
things
for
you
are
in
a
condition
to
appreciate
my
narrative
well
you
see
when
lottie
put
viola
and
me
to
winding
thread
it
afforded
a
topic
of
conversation
that
was
very
thoughtful
in
lottie
wasn
t
it
i
think
it
was
but
go
on
with
your
you
see
when
the
thread
would
get
tangled
we
had
to
help
each
other
fix
run
the
ball
through
here
wallingford
said
viola
no
not
that
way
but
the
other
just
here
between
my
hands
there
that
s
right
no
i
beg
pardon
it
was
all
my
fault
for
you
were
doing
it
right
before
i
spoke
you
ll
have
to
run
the
ball
back
the
same
way
between
my
now
ed
you
must
understand
that
while
all
this
was
going
on
i
was
not
looking
at
the
hank
of
thread
but
was
gazing
intently
at
the
beautiful
darling
before
me
as
a
natural
result
instead
of
untangling
the
thread
we
kept
making
it
worse
i
shall
hereafter
recommend
all
bashful
young
people
to
wind
yarn
when
they
wish
to
make
love
there
s
nothing
equal
to
it
as
an
to
conversation
stop
viola
said
i
as
i
took
hold
of
her
little
hand
you
have
got
this
thread
in
a
desperate
fix
let
me
hold
this
end
on
your
wrist
while
you
untangle
the
this
gave
me
an
excuse
to
hold
her
hand
which
i
assure
you
i
did
how
pale
your
hand
looks
viola
i
said
as
i
let
the
hank
fall
and
took
her
hand
with
both
of
mine
yes
my
hand
is
pale
i
you
have
a
very
small
hand
yes
i
believe
it
is
quite
small
but
we
had
better
finish
the
work
that
lottie
gave
us
to
no
let
us
talk
a
while
we
ll
have
plenty
of
time
to
do
the
work
i
think
this
is
quite
a
pretty
little
do
you
yes
indeed
i
do
and
i
think
the
owner
of
this
hand
is
very
pretty
i
declare
we
must
finish
this
thread
she
then
made
a
grab
at
the
ball
and
missed
it
and
it
went
rolling
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
she
went
after
it
two
of
the
hanks
had
fallen
to
the
floor
and
in
crossing
the
room
her
feet
became
entangled
in
the
thread
so
that
when
she
picked
up
the
ball
and
started
back
she
tripped
and
fell
plump
into
my
arms
of
course
i
could
do
no
less
than
catch
her
else
she
would
have
fallen
to
the
floor
dear
viola
i
exclaimed
i
love
you
with
all
my
heart
dare
i
hope
that
you
ever
will
be
mine
speak
darling
i
implore
you
no
man
ever
loved
as
i
love
you
give
me
one
little
word
of
encouragement
i
beseech
you
do
you
believe
me
innocent
of
the
awful
crime
of
which
i
am
charged
she
asked
believe
you
innocent
my
loved
one
i
would
as
soon
suspect
an
angel
from
heaven
as
you
nay
i
would
risk
my
soul
s
salvation
on
your
innocence
if
i
had
a
hundred
thousand
lives
i
d
risk
them
all
on
your
honor
if
a
legion
of
witnesses
were
to
swear
you
are
guilty
i
would
not
believe
it
viola
can
you
forgive
the
past
will
you
allow
me
to
hope
that
you
ever
will
love
me
i
can
not
endure
this
miserable
harry
would
you
be
willing
to
accept
my
hand
while
this
dark
cloud
of
disgrace
is
hovering
over
me
yes
yes
darling
ten
thousand
times
yes
she
nestled
her
face
into
my
bosom
and
burst
into
tears
then
ed
i
knew
she
was
mine
and
my
joy
was
unutterable
i
suppose
however
you
know
all
about
such
feelings
when
she
became
composed
she
promised
to
marry
me
when
her
innocence
should
be
made
manifest
to
the
world
now
you
know
all
and
can
readily
appreciate
my
chapter
xvi
it
was
on
the
morning
of
the
fourth
day
after
my
return
from
philadelphia
that
i
went
to
harry
s
office
for
the
purpose
of
holding
a
consultation
with
him
in
regard
to
miss
bramlett
s
case
i
was
anxious
to
know
what
progress
had
been
made
by
the
detectives
in
their
investigations
i
had
been
devoting
all
my
time
to
the
business
and
was
more
mystified
at
the
end
of
four
days
than
i
was
at
the
beginning
i
had
spent
some
time
in
making
a
survey
of
the
buildings
and
premises
where
the
murder
had
been
committed
this
i
had
been
advised
to
do
by
rockland
who
had
manifested
considerable
interest
in
the
case
i
had
great
confidence
in
the
cool
judgment
of
rockland
as
well
as
unlimited
faith
in
him
as
a
skillful
criminal
lawyer
and
he
told
me
that
a
thorough
investigation
of
the
house
and
its
contents
was
a
matter
that
ought
by
no
means
to
be
neglected
therefore
i
had
undertaken
that
job
as
my
part
of
the
work
i
had
taken
great
pains
to
make
a
correct
diagram
of
the
house
and
grounds
including
the
kitchen
servants
rooms
stables
garden
with
all
the
entrances
by
which
persons
could
get
into
the
inclosure
i
was
very
much
gratified
when
i
presented
my
diagram
to
rockland
for
he
examined
it
carefully
and
then
observed
that
the
work
was
satisfactory
and
had
been
very
skillfully
if
i
am
not
very
much
mistaken
demar
he
said
you
will
find
that
this
map
will
be
of
invaluable
service
to
you
before
this
affair
is
finally
disposed
of
if
it
should
turn
out
as
you
seem
to
think
that
the
crime
has
been
the
work
of
some
other
person
you
may
expect
to
find
secret
entrances
to
the
grounds
but
i
regret
to
say
that
i
fear
you
will
find
no
little
difficulty
in
establishing
miss
bramlett
s
innocence
i
have
no
hesitation
understand
me
in
asserting
that
i
have
always
regarded
miss
bramlett
as
a
pure
honest
young
lady
but
judging
from
the
reports
that
have
reached
me
in
regard
to
her
strange
conduct
i
am
led
to
believe
that
her
mind
has
not
been
altogether
right
if
it
comes
to
the
worst
i
shall
advise
the
plea
of
insanity
to
be
filed
i
am
well
aware
of
the
fact
that
pleas
of
that
sort
are
becoming
quite
common
of
late
and
that
the
courts
are
inclined
to
view
them
with
suspicion
yet
in
this
case
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
evidence
will
be
so
full
as
to
overcome
all
doubt
you
may
depend
on
me
demar
so
far
as
my
humble
ability
may
be
concerned
because
i
deeply
sympathize
with
this
unfortunate
young
lady
and
then
her
father
was
my
true
friend
and
i
should
be
an
ungrateful
wretch
if
i
did
not
put
forth
all
my
energy
and
influence
in
behalf
of
his
it
was
indeed
with
a
sorrowful
heart
beating
in
my
bosom
that
i
separated
from
rockland
at
the
close
of
the
interview
just
related
i
had
watched
miss
bramlett
closely
during
the
frequent
visits
i
had
made
to
the
jail
and
my
observations
convinced
me
that
notwithstanding
her
mind
was
sad
and
unsettled
she
had
complete
control
of
her
reason
then
in
the
second
place
i
knew
that
if
we
succeeded
in
proving
her
insane
it
would
be
a
fatal
blow
to
harry
s
happiness
the
room
in
which
young
harry
bramlett
died
was
a
small
square
bedroom
on
the
second
floor
in
the
corner
of
ragland
s
house
and
adjacent
to
the
one
that
had
been
occupied
by
miss
bramlett
there
was
a
partition
door
in
the
wall
that
separated
the
two
rooms
miss
bramlett
s
room
was
a
larger
one
than
that
occupied
by
her
young
brother
and
had
two
windows
and
one
door
besides
the
door
that
was
in
the
partition
wall
one
of
the
windows
was
in
the
front
overlooking
the
street
the
other
in
the
side
overlooking
a
small
flower
garden
that
lay
on
the
south
side
of
the
building
the
furniture
of
miss
bramlett
s
room
which
remained
just
as
it
was
when
her
brother
died
consisted
of
a
bureau
a
small
mahogany
bedstead
with
canopy
hung
with
pink
silk
a
large
rosewood
wardrobe
a
a
low
sofa
with
green
cushions
an
with
red
plush
cushions
a
cane
bottom
three
large
trunks
and
four
common
cane
bottom
chairs
a
portrait
of
bramlett
swung
by
a
red
twisted
cord
against
the
south
wall
of
the
room
while
bramlett
s
picture
in
a
large
gold
frame
hung
just
above
the
bed
a
photograph
of
miss
bramlett
and
her
little
brother
both
in
the
same
frame
hung
near
the
partition
door
as
i
gazed
on
miss
bramlett
s
picture
with
one
hand
clasped
in
that
of
her
little
brother
i
was
then
and
there
convinced
that
she
never
had
murdered
him
such
an
expression
of
purity
beamed
forth
from
the
beautiful
face
as
to
prove
to
my
mind
that
no
secret
thoughts
of
murder
ever
had
lurked
in
her
breast
i
was
informed
that
not
an
article
in
the
rooms
had
been
moved
since
the
night
when
the
little
boy
died
no
one
had
been
permitted
to
enter
either
one
of
the
rooms
after
the
corpse
had
been
removed
until
dabbs
had
arrived
a
guard
had
been
placed
at
the
entrance
with
positive
orders
not
to
allow
any
one
to
enter
the
rooms
this
had
been
done
at
harry
s
request
when
i
arrived
at
harry
s
office
i
found
him
alone
but
while
he
and
i
were
engaged
in
examining
my
diagram
dabbs
and
tadpoddle
came
into
the
inner
room
from
the
back
entrance
and
informed
us
that
they
had
important
facts
to
communicate
this
was
the
first
time
that
i
ever
had
laid
my
eyes
on
tadpoddle
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
seriousness
of
the
business
in
which
we
were
engaged
i
should
have
laughed
outright
as
soon
as
i
saw
him
the
comical
expression
of
his
features
the
peculiar
shape
of
his
nose
the
fantastic
style
of
his
dress
and
the
singular
disproportion
which
the
length
of
his
legs
bore
to
the
size
of
his
body
all
combined
to
produce
a
ridiculous
object
to
undertake
to
describe
him
would
be
a
failure
he
was
neither
man
beast
fowl
nor
fish
but
in
some
respects
resembled
all
his
right
ear
was
near
the
back
of
his
beard
the
place
where
his
nose
should
have
been
looked
like
a
on
a
sapling
his
left
eye
was
large
and
very
white
the
other
small
and
the
little
one
seemed
to
be
afraid
of
the
big
one
they
were
continually
playing
hide
and
seek
with
each
other
and
at
no
time
were
both
on
duty
at
the
same
moment
when
the
big
one
was
awake
the
little
one
was
asleep
i
noticed
that
when
the
big
one
would
retire
from
duty
the
little
one
would
come
to
the
front
cautiously
and
gaze
over
to
see
if
the
other
had
certainly
gone
and
if
any
movement
was
made
by
the
big
one
the
little
one
would
dart
back
into
his
hole
it
was
clear
to
my
mind
that
nature
did
not
intend
to
make
a
man
when
tadpoddle
was
commenced
but
the
whole
concern
seemed
to
convey
the
idea
that
nature
intended
him
for
a
huge
joke
if
you
will
close
that
door
wallingford
said
dabbs
so
that
we
will
be
free
from
interruption
i
have
an
important
report
to
harry
closed
the
door
and
requested
him
to
proceed
have
you
found
out
who
committed
the
murder
harry
inquired
as
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
dabbs
face
with
a
look
of
intense
anxiety
mr
wallingford
you
have
learned
the
lawyer
s
habit
early
i
perceive
you
have
commenced
a
sort
of
before
the
examination
in
chief
has
been
gone
through
with
you
lawyers
have
a
way
of
setting
your
pumps
to
work
on
a
fellow
so
as
to
draw
out
information
which
in
some
instances
ought
not
to
be
exposed
so
soon
but
in
this
particular
case
i
trust
you
will
not
consider
me
rude
or
discourteous
if
i
decline
to
be
it
is
our
business
to
examine
people
and
not
to
suffer
ourselves
to
be
examined
by
them
you
need
not
trouble
yourself
to
put
questions
to
me
i
ll
furnish
you
with
such
information
as
i
think
you
ought
to
have
and
withhold
such
as
ought
to
be
harry
bit
his
lips
with
vexation
i
suppose
dabbs
i
ought
to
submit
to
such
conditions
as
you
may
choose
to
propose
and
i
shall
do
it
very
cheerfully
if
it
will
aid
in
unearthing
this
so
far
as
mystery
is
concerned
wallingford
i
must
at
once
undeceive
you
i
have
as
yet
encountered
no
mystery
at
all
on
the
contrary
i
think
the
case
unusually
plain
don
t
you
tadpoddle
unquestionably
unquestionably
dabbs
i
never
saw
a
plainer
case
in
my
life
evidence
ample
to
convict
never
saw
a
better
chain
of
circumstantial
evidence
overwhelming
overwhelming
sir
no
use
to
hesitate
no
mistake
here
my
sister
s
statement
settles
the
question
beyond
doubt
i
presume
wallingford
you
know
my
sister
miss
jemima
tadpoddle
no
said
harry
his
face
reddening
with
impatience
i
am
sorry
to
say
i
have
not
had
the
honor
to
know
miss
indeed
sir
that
s
unfortunate
i
must
avail
myself
of
the
pleasure
to
introduce
you
to
my
sister
a
most
remarkable
woman
sir
rather
masculine
in
her
views
but
sensible
and
prudent
we
are
indebted
to
her
for
our
success
in
this
case
the
fact
is
wallingford
i
am
indebted
to
my
remarkable
sister
for
my
success
in
life
generally
she
would
be
delighted
to
know
you
and
i
dare
say
you
would
be
much
pleased
with
her
she
would
be
able
to
advise
you
in
this
business
no
doubt
as
her
judgment
may
be
relied
on
but
let
that
pass
for
the
present
what
was
it
you
were
about
to
observe
wallingford
i
was
about
to
ask
a
question
but
then
i
remembered
that
you
and
dabbs
had
intimated
a
wish
not
to
be
oh
not
at
all
sir
you
misunderstand
us
entirely
we
don
t
prohibit
questions
we
only
decline
to
be
examined
like
an
ordinary
witness
in
court
ask
as
many
questions
as
you
please
we
ll
only
answer
such
as
we
then
tadpoddle
threw
himself
back
in
his
chair
put
the
small
eye
on
duty
and
waited
for
the
question
if
you
have
any
communication
to
make
in
regard
to
the
discoveries
you
have
made
i
should
like
to
hear
them
now
just
so
wallingford
no
doubt
you
would
and
that
is
what
brought
us
here
i
am
well
aware
of
the
interest
you
feel
in
miss
bramlett
s
case
and
so
told
my
remarkable
sister
and
she
also
appreciated
the
situation
very
much
by
the
by
dabbs
don
t
you
think
we
had
better
tell
wallingford
what
my
remarkable
sister
knows
about
the
case
i
think
we
had
tadpoddle
but
let
them
be
told
after
the
other
facts
have
been
related
nothing
like
beginning
at
the
right
end
you
know
there
are
two
ways
to
tell
anything
one
right
way
and
one
wrong
way
always
commence
a
story
at
the
right
end
you
see
what
your
sister
knows
comes
last
in
order
to
make
the
chain
of
evidence
ah
yes
dabbs
i
perceive
now
that
you
are
right
well
you
tell
wallingford
about
the
other
things
and
when
it
comes
to
my
sister
s
part
then
let
me
i
was
losing
my
and
felt
as
if
i
must
do
something
rash
very
soon
i
think
i
should
have
hurled
a
lump
of
coal
at
tadpoddle
s
little
gourd
head
but
my
attention
was
diverted
to
dabbs
who
began
to
take
something
from
his
this
little
parcel
wallingford
is
a
dose
of
strychnine
similar
to
the
one
that
killed
miss
bramlett
s
little
brother
well
what
of
that
is
the
question
that
naturally
would
come
up
in
your
mind
you
ll
observe
wallingford
that
i
am
only
drawing
an
inference
as
to
ideas
which
would
be
likely
to
present
themselves
well
what
if
that
is
strychnine
you
say
very
good
i
reply
the
deceased
was
murdered
with
strychnine
some
one
administered
the
poison
who
ah
that
s
the
question
i
answer
without
hesitation
miss
tis
false
exclaimed
harry
as
he
made
at
the
detective
with
eyes
flashing
with
rage
i
ll
choke
the
breath
from
the
villain
s
lungs
who
dares
to
accuse
miss
i
quickly
placed
myself
before
harry
and
prevented
him
from
choking
dabbs
and
endeavored
to
keep
him
quiet
though
i
thought
a
little
pressure
on
dabbs
would
have
been
justifiable
i
succeeded
in
getting
harry
to
resume
his
seat
then
requested
dabbs
to
proceed
if
wallingford
is
unwilling
to
hear
facts
said
dabbs
we
had
better
let
the
interview
terminate
here
it
is
our
duty
as
officers
of
the
law
to
close
our
eyes
to
consequences
and
bring
facts
to
light
we
can
t
consider
the
feelings
and
wishes
of
individuals
in
our
searches
after
truth
if
we
did
we
should
accomplish
nothing
we
do
not
make
evidence
we
only
bring
to
light
that
which
is
made
by
circumstances
and
concealed
by
fraud
if
the
evidence
that
we
have
discovered
does
not
please
wallingford
we
will
not
thrust
it
on
his
hearing
but
will
deliver
it
to
the
officers
of
the
law
whose
duty
it
is
to
use
it
in
punishing
the
guilty
and
protecting
the
you
are
right
dabbs
and
i
was
wrong
said
harry
as
he
leaned
his
head
down
on
the
and
sighed
sadly
tell
us
the
worst
at
well
this
dose
of
strychnine
was
found
in
miss
bramlett
s
room
concealed
in
the
pocket
of
a
blue
silk
dress
which
belonged
to
mr
dabbs
paused
and
looked
at
tadpoddle
tadpoddle
put
the
big
eye
on
duty
while
the
little
one
made
a
precipitate
retreat
harry
groaned
like
one
whose
heart
was
crushed
i
wanted
to
commit
some
kind
of
mischief
but
did
not
exactly
know
what
it
was
at
length
dabbs
spoke
again
after
he
had
sufficiently
enjoyed
the
misery
inflicted
on
us
by
the
first
revelation
the
mere
naked
fact
that
miss
bramlett
had
a
dose
of
strychnine
in
one
of
her
dress
pockets
does
not
signify
much
but
when
viewed
in
connection
with
other
circumstances
the
case
is
different
to
sum
up
the
ideas
we
must
be
very
cautious
to
sift
things
so
as
to
separate
the
wheat
from
the
chaff
however
we
don
t
always
find
it
prudent
even
to
throw
away
the
chaff
because
it
will
sometimes
show
us
which
way
the
wind
blows
now
in
this
case
i
think
we
can
see
which
way
the
wind
is
blowing
without
the
use
of
the
chaff
the
fact
is
the
breeze
seems
to
be
all
the
time
blowing
in
the
same
direction
we
found
three
small
scraps
of
blue
paper
two
upon
chemical
examination
were
found
to
contain
small
quantities
of
quinine
while
the
other
one
contained
unmistakable
evidence
of
having
been
filled
with
strychnine
we
found
a
little
package
of
quinine
in
the
now
it
is
very
plain
that
this
was
emptied
out
of
one
of
the
papers
left
by
doctor
dodson
and
that
the
strychnine
was
put
in
the
same
paper
instead
of
the
quinine
that
goes
to
show
beyond
doubt
that
the
poison
was
administered
intentionally
but
by
whom
you
would
of
course
be
inclined
to
ask
very
good
let
us
proceed
to
make
the
inquiry
now
said
tadpoddle
i
think
is
the
time
to
tell
wallingford
what
valuable
evidence
has
been
discovered
by
my
remarkable
mr
tadpoddle
s
little
eye
then
went
back
to
its
hole
and
the
big
one
came
to
the
front
no
not
yet
tadpoddle
said
dabbs
as
he
bit
the
corner
off
of
a
plug
of
tobacco
and
began
to
chew
it
with
great
energy
there
are
other
matters
to
be
mentioned
before
we
disclose
your
sister
s
evidence
there
is
the
secret
gate
you
must
remember
that
will
furnish
a
very
strong
link
in
our
chain
a
link
which
i
consider
of
great
importance
so
far
so
good
now
tadpoddle
allow
me
to
call
your
attention
to
a
certain
letter
or
note
some
people
i
believe
would
call
it
a
no
matter
what
they
call
it
nothing
in
a
name
you
know
at
least
shakespeare
so
testified
in
favor
of
that
idea
be
so
kind
as
to
hand
me
that
tadpoddle
i
believe
i
gave
it
to
you
tadpoddle
s
big
eye
retired
slowly
and
the
little
one
came
out
and
then
darted
back
then
came
out
again
a
game
of
hide
and
seek
being
commenced
between
them
the
big
eye
seemed
to
be
hesitating
as
if
undecided
about
the
propriety
of
giving
the
field
to
the
little
one
but
the
little
one
appeared
to
have
scraped
up
courage
and
made
a
bold
charge
to
the
front
when
the
large
eye
gave
up
the
contest
at
last
and
hid
in
its
den
tadpoddle
seemed
to
be
waiting
to
know
which
eye
he
would
have
to
depend
on
while
looking
for
the
note
but
as
soon
as
the
matter
was
settled
he
drew
from
his
breast
pocket
an
old
and
began
to
take
out
a
great
number
of
old
dirty
papers
carefully
scrutinizing
each
one
as
he
took
it
out
ah
here
it
is
dabbs
by
jove
it
s
a
clincher
ain
t
it
dabbs
did
not
reply
to
tadpoddle
s
question
but
turning
his
attention
to
harry
said
mr
wallingford
you
will
pardon
me
sir
but
duty
is
duty
you
know
and
at
the
risk
of
incurring
your
displeasure
i
must
perform
my
duty
you
will
doubtless
be
surprised
to
learn
that
miss
bramlett
has
been
holding
clandestine
meetings
with
a
gambler
for
many
harry
would
have
knocked
him
down
but
i
anticipated
the
movement
and
held
him
in
his
seat
edward
said
he
must
i
sit
here
and
listen
to
this
am
i
a
contemptible
coward
shall
i
let
them
kill
that
poor
girl
and
then
blacken
her
fair
name
is
this
harry
wallingford
who
sits
here
quietly
listening
to
such
a
foul
slander
on
the
name
of
his
affianced
bride
would
you
have
me
to
whine
and
smile
and
fawn
on
the
base
wretch
who
utters
such
language
if
ever
there
was
a
time
when
it
was
necessary
for
you
to
control
your
temper
that
time
is
now
the
awful
situation
in
which
miss
bramlett
is
placed
should
convince
you
that
nothing
can
be
done
for
her
unless
cool
judgment
and
common
sense
shall
take
the
place
of
passion
and
rashness
dabbs
may
be
mistaken
in
his
conclusions
and
i
think
he
is
yet
he
believes
he
is
performing
his
duty
therefore
i
beseech
you
to
hear
all
he
has
to
say
then
after
we
have
heard
it
all
we
will
advise
with
rockland
on
the
subject
i
have
great
confidence
in
his
sound
judgment
and
i
know
his
sympathies
are
with
us
give
us
a
promise
now
harry
that
you
will
endeavor
to
control
yourself
you
have
committed
some
great
errors
and
it
behooves
you
to
repair
them
you
can
command
your
passion
if
you
will
determine
to
do
edward
said
he
you
are
right
i
have
been
very
indiscreet
and
to
some
extent
inexcusable
i
promise
to
do
as
you
wish
let
dabbs
proceed
i
ll
hear
all
he
has
to
i
then
requested
dabbs
to
proceed
i
am
exceedingly
sorry
said
he
that
wallingford
should
be
disposed
to
censure
me
for
stating
facts
when
he
must
know
that
the
discovery
of
these
facts
did
not
afford
any
pleasure
to
me
i
may
say
i
was
pained
to
find
that
circumstances
were
continually
pointing
to
miss
bramlett
as
the
guilty
one
i
had
hoped
to
find
evidence
of
her
innocence
and
such
a
result
would
have
given
me
more
pleasure
than
anything
we
could
find
against
her
it
is
clear
to
my
mind
that
the
poor
young
lady
has
been
the
victim
of
some
heartless
villain
or
that
she
has
been
laboring
under
temporary
insanity
whether
or
not
i
am
correct
in
that
opinion
it
is
not
my
business
just
now
to
inquire
that
is
a
question
for
the
courts
and
lawyers
to
settle
when
she
is
put
on
trial
my
business
is
to
show
what
has
been
done
and
nothing
shall
cause
me
to
shrink
from
the
performance
of
that
duty
there
is
a
young
man
keeping
a
gambling
hell
in
this
city
a
young
man
of
handsome
face
and
fascinating
manners
though
a
shrewd
sly
scoundrel
who
had
something
to
do
with
this
business
and
i
flatter
myself
that
i
shall
be
able
to
expose
him
before
i
get
through
with
this
affair
i
have
been
shadowing
him
he
often
gets
drunk
and
i
never
failed
to
manage
his
sort
he
talks
freely
when
drinking
and
i
will
pump
the
secret
out
of
him
before
i
quit
i
played
poker
with
him
the
other
night
he
beat
me
out
of
forty
dollars
the
rascal
but
i
shall
let
him
win
and
give
him
rope
to
hang
himself
with
i
ll
catch
up
with
the
villain
yet
his
apartments
are
furnished
like
the
palace
of
a
king
where
did
the
money
come
from
to
pay
for
it
i
dare
say
he
wheedled
miss
bramlett
out
of
it
that
unfortunate
young
girl
has
been
so
imprudent
as
to
make
frequent
visits
to
these
apartments
during
the
dark
hours
of
oh
heavens
eddie
exclaimed
harry
as
he
seized
me
by
the
arm
have
i
got
to
hear
such
as
this
and
say
nothing
it
s
more
than
humanity
can
bear
it
will
kill
me
for
heaven
s
sake
let
this
interview
terminate
else
i
shall
lose
my
reason
be
quiet
i
pray
you
harry
i
said
though
i
felt
the
demon
rising
in
my
own
breast
and
needed
all
the
prudence
i
could
command
in
order
to
keep
me
from
knocking
the
man
down
myself
my
attempt
to
soothe
and
quiet
harry
however
served
to
aid
me
in
keeping
cool
and
after
the
lapse
of
a
few
moments
i
directed
dabbs
to
proceed
i
was
about
to
observe
a
moment
ago
that
miss
bramlett
has
been
exceedingly
imprudent
if
not
criminal
in
her
intrigue
with
ben
with
whom
did
you
say
groaned
harry
why
with
ben
bowles
that
unprincipled
he
must
be
the
same
fellow
you
knocked
on
the
head
at
our
camp
i
said
to
harry
i
should
not
be
surprised
he
replied
then
turning
to
dabbs
i
requested
him
to
give
me
a
description
of
bowles
he
is
very
handsome
has
hair
very
black
eyes
is
about
five
and
twenty
years
old
very
tall
i
should
say
not
less
than
six
feet
dresses
magnificently
drinks
to
excess
has
a
deep
bass
voice
and
a
slight
scar
on
his
left
temple
close
to
the
that
is
the
very
man
said
i
as
i
again
requested
dabbs
to
go
on
with
his
history
well
he
began
as
i
was
saying
just
now
i
can
not
account
for
the
strange
conduct
of
miss
bramlett
except
upon
the
theory
that
she
has
become
fascinated
with
that
scoundrel
and
was
contemplating
a
secret
marriage
with
him
at
all
events
she
has
been
frequently
seen
to
enter
his
apartments
through
a
private
door
that
opens
on
an
alley
in
the
rear
of
the
i
shall
go
mad
said
harry
as
his
head
fell
on
my
shoulder
i
could
hear
his
heart
throb
and
jump
against
his
breast
as
if
in
great
commotion
can
this
horrible
story
be
true
can
the
devil
take
the
shape
of
an
angel
in
order
to
drag
the
soul
down
to
hell
hush
hush
harry
there
is
some
strange
mistake
connected
with
the
affair
and
i
ll
risk
my
life
on
viola
s
thank
you
a
thousand
times
from
the
very
bottom
of
my
heart
but
where
is
the
cowardly
villain
who
originated
this
damnable
falsehood
oh
if
i
could
only
get
my
hand
on
his
accursed
throat
let
us
first
find
out
who
is
working
these
secret
wires
said
i
and
then
we
may
be
able
to
contend
with
the
enemy
with
hopes
of
success
if
miss
bramlett
ever
has
visited
that
place
she
has
been
inveigled
into
it
by
foul
and
fraudulent
means
she
was
continually
searching
for
worthy
objects
of
charity
and
some
false
sneaking
scoundrel
may
have
entrapped
her
into
that
house
how
easily
might
she
have
been
induced
to
believe
that
some
unfortunate
creature
was
dying
in
that
house
for
want
of
food
i
know
that
she
would
have
gone
there
or
anywhere
else
to
render
assistance
where
suffering
humanity
needed
help
no
if
this
is
the
worst
that
can
be
said
of
viola
you
have
reason
to
rejoice
for
you
may
rest
assured
she
will
be
able
to
explain
it
i
believe
you
and
shall
hear
all
that
can
be
no
indeed
wallingford
said
dabbs
far
be
it
from
me
to
report
anything
in
this
case
except
the
naked
truth
i
have
no
bias
for
or
against
any
one
i
assure
you
it
is
the
duty
of
one
in
my
position
to
be
careful
to
keep
his
mind
clear
of
prejudice
and
to
look
only
to
the
detection
of
crime
and
if
miss
bramlett
shall
be
able
to
offer
a
satisfactory
explanation
of
her
conduct
in
this
instance
it
will
be
a
source
of
gratification
to
me
my
mind
tells
me
that
this
man
bowles
had
something
to
do
with
the
death
of
young
bramlett
and
if
he
had
i
shall
not
stop
until
i
can
prove
it
the
fact
that
miss
bramlett
has
frequently
met
bowles
under
suspicious
circumstances
has
been
ascertained
to
a
certainty
but
after
all
it
may
as
you
have
suggested
be
easily
explained
by
her
a
lady
of
miss
bramlett
s
tender
age
having
but
little
experience
in
the
wicked
ways
of
the
world
would
be
a
lamb
in
the
power
of
such
a
wolf
as
bowles
he
is
frequently
out
of
money
and
when
such
unprincipled
scamps
want
funds
they
would
commit
murder
or
any
other
crime
to
get
it
he
is
extravagant
beyond
measure
loves
wine
and
women
keeps
four
fast
trotters
at
burton
s
bets
high
at
the
gaming
table
and
occasionally
dines
his
friends
extravagantly
now
all
this
costs
money
and
it
is
my
opinion
that
miss
bramlett
s
money
has
largely
contributed
to
that
establishment
you
know
that
she
has
within
the
last
twelve
months
squandered
over
ten
thousand
dollars
in
cash
besides
incurring
debts
equal
to
the
cash
spent
by
her
father
s
will
she
had
the
right
to
spend
the
income
of
her
inheritance
but
could
not
touch
the
principal
she
went
through
with
the
income
and
from
all
accounts
would
have
speedily
wasted
the
principal
but
the
trustees
positively
refused
to
allow
it
her
little
brother
did
not
draw
any
of
his
income
at
all
and
when
he
died
his
sister
of
course
became
the
owner
of
his
share
not
only
of
the
income
but
of
the
entire
estate
people
do
not
commit
murder
without
a
motive
did
miss
bramlett
have
a
motive
to
murder
her
brother
of
course
we
answer
unhesitatingly
yes
what
motive
what
did
she
gain
by
the
death
of
her
brother
answer
ten
thousand
dollars
ready
cash
in
hand
and
two
hundred
thousand
dollars
added
to
her
inheritance
if
that
did
not
constitute
a
motive
i
would
like
some
one
to
inform
me
what
would
bowles
was
in
great
stress
for
want
of
money
at
that
time
as
i
happen
to
know
the
wolf
may
have
used
the
lamb
as
his
agent
to
get
the
funds
he
wanted
he
wrote
a
note
to
miss
bramlett
in
which
he
implored
her
to
let
him
have
five
hundred
dollars
that
note
was
found
in
her
dress
pocket
it
is
the
document
we
mentioned
a
moment
ago
and
here
it
is
dear
don
t
fail
me
come
at
eight
o
clock
i
will
be
alone
i
am
dying
to
see
you
for
heaven
s
sake
let
me
have
the
five
hundred
dollars
as
i
am
in
a
tight
place
just
now
i
found
your
note
under
the
seat
in
the
summer
house
i
knew
where
to
look
for
it
of
course
i
pressed
it
to
my
lips
before
i
read
it
when
i
see
you
we
will
discuss
our
plans
more
fully
if
you
can
accomplish
the
business
with
a
brave
heart
we
shall
yet
be
happy
i
know
that
you
have
the
courage
to
do
it
if
you
set
your
mind
on
it
detection
would
be
impossible
if
you
adopt
my
plan
though
we
will
talk
the
matter
over
when
i
have
you
in
my
arms
yours
and
yours
only
b
catch
wallingford
there
he
has
fainted
exclaimed
dabbs
as
he
sprang
forward
and
attempted
to
prevent
harry
from
falling
but
he
was
too
late
for
harry
was
lying
on
the
floor
before
dabbs
got
to
him
i
was
unable
to
render
any
assistance
being
completely
overcome
with
horror
at
hearing
the
contents
of
the
letter
most
of
my
hopes
of
viola
s
innocence
vanished
when
the
note
was
read
dabbs
lifted
harry
up
and
laid
him
on
a
sofa
while
tadpoddle
sprinkled
his
face
with
water
and
took
off
his
cravat
unbuttoning
his
collar
then
harry
began
to
breathe
faintly
but
such
a
look
of
despair
as
settled
on
his
face
i
never
beheld
there
before
i
was
unable
to
offer
consolation
for
i
was
in
need
of
it
myself
the
blood
seemed
to
be
freezing
in
my
veins
it
was
plain
that
bowles
letter
referred
to
the
plan
which
had
for
its
object
the
murder
of
viola
s
brother
the
bare
thought
that
such
was
the
fact
made
my
heart
stand
still
have
we
all
been
deceived
by
this
beautiful
girl
is
she
after
all
a
cruel
calculating
murderess
and
the
mistress
of
a
villain
could
it
be
possible
that
one
so
beautiful
possessed
the
heart
of
a
murderess
could
it
be
that
she
who
looked
like
the
very
embodiment
of
purity
was
the
horrible
thing
that
i
blush
to
think
of
questions
of
that
nature
came
pouring
in
on
my
mind
and
if
i
had
been
compelled
to
answer
i
should
have
been
forced
to
admit
that
the
evidence
was
overwhelming
against
viola
it
was
plain
to
my
mind
that
it
would
not
do
to
depend
on
harry
any
longer
he
was
more
like
a
raving
maniac
than
anything
else
i
began
to
fear
that
he
would
seek
a
quarrel
with
bowles
a
thing
which
above
all
others
i
thought
should
be
avoided
as
it
would
prevent
the
detectives
from
getting
at
the
bottom
of
the
case
if
harry
should
attack
bowles
i
knew
that
one
or
the
other
would
be
killed
and
how
to
prevent
it
was
the
question
uppermost
in
my
mind
just
then
i
knew
all
about
harry
s
ungovernable
temper
and
his
lack
of
fear
and
imagined
from
his
looks
that
he
had
resolved
on
something
rash
his
face
was
pale
as
death
i
at
once
divined
the
thoughts
that
were
passing
through
his
mind
and
was
endeavoring
to
invent
some
plan
to
prevent
a
meeting
between
him
and
bowles
when
he
addressed
me
in
a
tone
so
low
that
it
was
not
much
above
a
whisper
eddie
it
is
all
over
with
me
i
am
a
ruined
man
there
is
but
one
course
left
for
me
to
pursue
bowles
must
answer
for
the
ruin
he
has
wrought
poor
girl
i
pity
her
and
before
heaven
i
swear
to
be
her
avenger
she
is
a
helpless
orphan
and
it
is
my
duty
to
defend
her
notwithstanding
she
has
forfeited
all
right
to
my
i
grew
impatient
i
was
becoming
tired
of
harry
s
imprudence
and
could
not
forget
the
fact
that
his
selfish
pride
has
caused
all
this
trouble
i
think
said
i
endeavoring
to
keep
down
my
rising
temper
that
i
heard
you
say
if
every
man
woman
and
child
in
memphis
were
to
swear
viola
was
guilty
you
would
believe
they
were
mistaken
and
now
at
the
first
intimation
of
her
guilt
without
any
proof
whatever
you
are
the
very
one
to
condemn
her
is
this
the
confidence
you
have
in
your
affianced
bride
indeed
i
congratulate
miss
bramlett
in
the
possession
of
such
a
true
lover
stop
edward
he
said
as
he
rose
from
his
seat
and
began
to
walk
the
floor
i
know
i
have
said
many
foolish
things
and
committed
numerous
blunders
in
this
business
but
it
can
t
mend
matters
for
you
to
be
throwing
it
up
to
me
i
admit
that
in
some
instances
my
conduct
was
inexcusable
but
i
was
trying
to
repair
the
damage
caused
by
it
it
is
too
late
now
nothing
that
any
one
could
say
would
have
any
effect
on
me
after
what
i
have
heard
my
heart
has
turned
to
stone
and
i
don
t
think
it
could
feel
anything
at
all
perhaps
it
is
best
that
it
should
be
so
i
have
a
duty
to
perform
now
that
will
require
coolness
and
i
feel
that
i
could
see
blood
run
from
the
heart
of
viola
s
betrayer
without
compunction
i
have
a
double
account
to
settle
with
him
and
it
shall
be
settled
in
a
manner
that
will
be
if
you
would
listen
to
the
advice
of
your
friends
you
never
would
let
bowles
know
that
you
have
obtained
a
clew
to
his
villainy
until
you
have
secured
enough
proof
to
convict
him
in
open
court
it
is
very
clear
that
if
he
is
the
author
of
that
letter
he
has
been
the
prime
mover
in
the
murder
of
miss
bramlett
s
brother
and
it
is
also
very
plain
that
other
letters
have
been
written
for
he
mentions
the
place
where
letters
were
deposited
and
received
now
if
you
make
a
row
you
put
him
on
his
guard
and
thereby
give
him
a
chance
to
escape
but
if
you
keep
quiet
and
let
dabbs
work
on
him
i
think
it
would
enable
us
to
trap
him
above
all
things
let
us
give
dabbs
an
opportunity
to
work
up
the
case
so
far
as
bowles
is
concerned
a
man
must
learn
to
control
himself
before
he
can
expect
to
control
other
people
and
when
you
make
up
your
mind
to
act
with
your
friends
and
not
against
them
i
am
prepared
to
proceed
further
in
this
business
if
on
the
other
hand
you
mean
to
seek
a
quarrel
with
bowles
and
destroy
all
hopes
of
securing
proof
of
his
guilt
i
beg
to
say
that
i
wash
my
hands
of
the
whole
i
will
promise
to
wait
until
dabbs
shall
have
a
chance
to
do
what
he
can
but
remember
i
only
promise
to
postpone
his
very
well
i
accept
the
promise
and
we
can
discuss
his
punishment
at
another
time
we
must
see
lottie
at
once
and
prevail
on
her
to
tell
what
she
knows
i
am
sure
she
could
furnish
us
some
important
information
if
she
would
while
i
am
ready
to
admit
that
my
confidence
in
viola
s
honor
has
been
somewhat
shaken
i
must
be
permitted
to
say
that
i
have
not
lost
all
hopes
hence
my
anxiety
to
know
the
truth
has
been
increased
very
much
by
what
i
have
just
have
you
anything
further
to
communicate
said
i
addressing
dabbs
if
you
have
we
beg
you
to
ah
hem
yes
demar
replied
the
detective
as
he
took
the
last
corner
from
his
plug
of
tobacco
i
have
something
more
to
say
and
in
the
first
place
allow
me
to
mention
the
fact
that
i
heartily
indorse
your
idea
as
to
bowles
we
must
by
all
means
keep
him
in
the
dark
as
to
what
we
have
resurrected
against
him
he
is
a
sly
shrewd
rascal
but
i
ll
capture
him
if
you
don
t
thwart
me
in
ragland
s
flower
garden
there
is
a
large
made
of
and
all
covered
over
with
vines
it
is
constructed
in
an
octagonal
shape
with
wooden
benches
arranged
round
inside
this
house
has
been
the
meeting
place
of
miss
bramlett
and
bowles
miss
jemima
tadpoddle
saw
them
there
one
night
at
a
very
late
hour
she
had
called
to
see
ragland
one
evening
and
was
informed
by
the
that
her
mistress
had
gone
out
to
attend
a
meeting
of
some
benevolent
society
of
which
she
was
an
active
member
but
the
maid
told
miss
tadpoddle
that
ragland
would
be
in
soon
and
while
waiting
in
the
for
ragland
s
return
she
saw
miss
bramlett
go
into
the
soon
after
miss
bramlett
went
into
the
place
bowles
came
in
through
a
secret
entrance
at
the
back
of
the
garden
and
went
into
the
where
miss
bramlett
was
watching
for
him
after
waiting
a
long
time
to
see
ragland
miss
tadpoddle
left
without
seeing
her
and
when
she
went
away
bowles
and
miss
bramlett
were
still
in
the
how
long
they
remained
there
she
of
course
did
not
know
when
miss
tadpoddle
gave
us
this
information
we
made
a
thorough
examination
of
the
premises
in
order
to
find
the
place
where
bowles
got
into
the
garden
we
searched
for
some
time
without
any
result
but
at
last
we
found
his
entering
place
and
i
must
give
him
credit
for
great
skill
for
the
manner
in
which
he
had
managed
it
the
garden
was
inclosed
with
a
common
paling
fence
of
pine
timber
painted
white
the
palings
being
about
four
feet
high
sharpened
to
a
point
at
the
top
and
nailed
to
a
horizontal
railing
three
of
those
palings
had
been
so
arranged
that
they
could
be
taken
off
and
replaced
so
as
to
leave
no
signs
of
having
been
removed
the
nails
that
had
originally
been
driven
in
to
hold
the
palings
in
their
places
had
been
drawn
out
small
wooden
pins
put
in
their
stead
so
that
when
anyone
wished
to
enter
the
garden
he
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
draw
out
the
wooden
pins
take
off
the
palings
and
walk
in
then
replace
them
and
no
one
could
see
that
the
palings
had
ever
been
interfered
with
i
don
t
think
we
should
have
made
the
discovery
had
it
not
been
for
the
signs
left
on
the
grass
by
the
feet
of
the
party
who
had
evidently
entered
very
often
we
found
that
the
ground
near
the
place
had
been
hardened
by
continuous
tramping
on
it
and
this
led
us
to
examine
the
palings
very
closely
the
result
was
we
found
what
i
have
just
mentioned
we
made
a
very
extensive
search
among
the
blades
of
tall
grass
that
grew
in
the
vicinity
of
the
entrance
and
we
found
an
article
which
we
believe
to
be
a
set
that
has
fallen
from
a
finger
ring
i
should
say
that
it
was
of
considerable
value
as
it
looks
like
a
genuine
diamond
this
little
article
may
enable
us
to
get
our
grabbers
on
bowles
because
if
it
is
his
he
of
course
has
the
ring
from
which
it
has
been
detached
one
thing
is
certain
bowles
has
not
only
received
miss
bramlett
at
his
apartments
very
often
but
he
has
been
meeting
her
in
the
many
a
time
i
believe
this
ends
what
i
had
to
report
permit
me
to
take
my
leave
now
and
you
shall
hear
from
us
again
queen
mary
now
expressed
a
wish
that
the
further
hearing
of
the
story
should
be
postponed
in
order
that
the
maskers
might
have
a
recess
chapter
xvii
ivanhoe
and
scottie
were
seated
in
the
rear
of
the
pilot
house
discussing
and
dissecting
ingomar
s
story
what
do
you
think
of
the
story
now
sir
knight
inquired
scottie
do
you
like
it
or
not
so
so
some
parts
i
like
and
some
i
don
t
there
s
too
much
talk
of
murder
in
do
you
think
from
what
you
have
heard
of
the
story
that
miss
bramlett
committed
the
murder
there
is
no
room
to
doubt
it
if
we
are
to
judge
from
the
evidence
that
has
come
up
against
her
if
ingomar
can
get
her
out
of
the
scrape
without
flatly
contradicting
himself
he
will
be
entitled
to
the
premium
as
the
champion
i
agree
with
you
there
because
if
i
were
on
a
jury
and
such
evidence
was
brought
before
me
i
should
say
guilty
beyond
the
possibility
of
a
well
scottie
give
me
your
opinion
of
ah
sir
knight
that
s
an
overdrawn
picture
angels
have
long
since
quit
visiting
the
earth
i
don
t
think
i
have
heard
of
any
being
down
in
this
world
since
jacob
had
such
a
scuffle
with
you
are
wrong
there
they
have
been
here
frequently
since
that
affair
with
jacob
but
let
that
pass
and
tell
me
what
you
think
of
she
makes
a
splendid
heroine
for
a
that
may
be
true
yet
it
is
so
pleasant
to
hear
ingomar
talk
about
her
did
you
know
that
somehow
or
other
an
idea
has
got
into
this
head
of
mine
no
indeed
is
that
so
pshaw
you
didn
t
let
me
finish
the
sentence
i
was
about
to
remark
that
somehow
an
idea
had
got
into
my
head
that
you
are
just
like
oh
you
are
badly
lost
now
for
i
am
a
plain
simple
girl
just
like
other
girls
only
not
so
pretty
and
then
i
have
an
awful
temper
oh
you
ought
to
hear
me
when
i
am
i
am
truly
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
for
i
like
a
woman
they
make
things
generally
stand
round
so
lively
have
the
servants
walk
to
a
line
keep
the
floor
so
clean
set
such
nice
dinners
and
then
it
is
so
delightful
to
have
a
good
jolly
quarrel
get
up
a
great
row
shed
a
few
tears
and
then
make
friends
then
kiss
oh
that
s
the
girl
for
me
you
draw
one
side
of
the
picture
very
you
can
t
frighten
me
with
such
an
insinuation
but
you
only
increase
my
anxiety
to
know
more
about
you
by
the
by
were
you
ever
in
love
oh
yes
i
was
dead
in
love
with
a
fellow
once
he
was
such
a
darling
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
love
him
yet
he
had
such
a
black
beard
such
black
hair
and
was
so
handsome
my
hair
is
black
and
so
is
my
i
dare
say
it
is
what
if
it
should
turn
out
that
it
was
you
after
all
were
you
ever
in
love
indeed
yes
i
loved
a
pretty
girl
with
hair
and
large
gray
eyes
and
would
have
married
her
but
for
a
very
trivial
little
circumstance
she
wouldn
t
have
i
suppose
she
didn
t
like
black
hair
and
a
black
well
we
didn
t
marry
suppose
sir
knight
you
entertain
me
with
a
history
of
your
love
scrape
i
will
on
condition
that
you
will
follow
suit
with
your
little
episode
when
i
am
through
with
all
right
i
ll
do
mine
is
a
short
story
but
very
affecting
and
if
you
have
tears
prepare
to
shed
them
well
hold
on
then
till
i
get
out
my
handkerchief
here
it
is
now
go
i
was
in
the
city
of
jackson
mississippi
once
attending
the
legislature
of
which
i
was
a
wait
a
moment
till
i
catch
this
tear
i
think
i
feel
one
in
my
left
what
have
i
said
that
could
have
started
a
tear
that
you
were
a
member
of
the
mississippi
legislature
that
was
the
reason
your
girl
refused
to
marry
well
perhaps
it
was
though
i
have
repented
of
that
and
have
promised
to
go
and
sin
no
more
in
that
way
but
i
am
digressing
while
i
was
in
jackson
i
was
invited
by
some
friends
to
join
them
in
a
picnic
dinner
on
the
beautiful
banks
of
pearl
river
many
lovely
women
were
with
the
party
one
in
particular
it
was
a
clear
case
of
love
at
first
sight
on
my
side
and
spontaneous
indifference
on
hers
the
dinner
was
magnificent
my
girl
unloaded
a
basket
it
made
my
mouth
water
to
watch
her
pretty
little
white
hands
lifting
out
the
nice
cake
the
luscious
jam
the
roast
turkey
the
broiled
chicken
the
bread
the
great
yellow
rolls
of
butter
i
fell
in
love
with
her
and
the
contents
of
her
basket
and
felt
like
devouring
the
whole
concern
then
and
there
it
would
have
done
you
good
to
see
the
sweet
smile
she
cast
on
me
as
she
invited
me
to
take
a
seat
by
her
side
and
eat
with
her
i
made
up
my
mind
to
make
her
an
offer
of
marriage
at
the
first
opportunity
and
i
was
very
much
mortified
to
learn
that
three
other
fellows
had
determined
to
do
likewise
all
three
of
them
had
great
advantages
over
me
they
were
not
members
of
the
mississippi
legislature
and
i
was
i
had
to
carry
too
much
dead
weight
after
dinner
was
over
the
band
began
to
play
a
lively
tune
and
some
one
proposed
a
dance
i
made
a
dash
toward
my
girl
with
the
view
of
asking
her
to
be
my
partner
in
the
dance
she
smiled
sweetly
on
me
but
danced
with
another
fellow
i
then
took
the
pouts
and
refused
to
dance
at
all
while
the
angry
fit
was
on
me
i
wandered
off
down
the
banks
of
the
river
alone
vowing
to
cripple
somebody
before
night
when
i
had
fully
made
up
my
mind
to
do
it
the
next
question
was
how
could
i
accomplish
it
without
getting
crippled
myself
i
could
not
for
the
life
of
me
think
of
any
plan
that
would
enable
me
to
get
rid
of
my
rivals
without
endangering
myself
therefore
i
was
forced
to
abandon
the
enterprise
altogether
but
while
i
was
rambling
along
the
bank
of
the
river
meditating
dire
destruction
a
young
gray
squirrel
ran
across
my
path
and
i
caught
him
and
carried
him
in
triumph
to
the
picnic
headquarters
my
girl
cast
on
me
another
one
of
her
sweet
smiles
as
she
begged
me
to
give
her
the
pretty
darling
little
squirrel
i
of
course
forgot
my
angry
fit
and
gave
it
to
her
it
was
but
a
moment
after
i
had
given
it
into
her
hand
when
she
uttered
a
loud
scream
and
let
the
little
squirrel
drop
on
the
ground
the
entire
party
took
after
the
squirrel
except
me
and
my
girl
i
saw
the
blood
streaming
from
her
hand
where
the
little
animal
had
bitten
her
i
took
off
her
glove
and
washed
the
blood
from
her
hand
then
tied
it
up
with
my
handkerchief
i
hid
her
glove
in
my
bosom
where
i
have
worn
it
ever
since
here
it
is
now
with
the
stain
of
her
dear
blood
on
it
why
scottie
i
declare
you
are
weeping
sure
enough
what
on
earth
is
the
matter
pray
what
is
she
was
weeping
the
tears
running
down
her
cheeks
in
a
stream
have
i
said
anything
to
offend
you
i
did
not
intend
it
if
i
it
was
some
time
before
scottie
became
composed
and
ivanhoe
was
very
much
astonished
at
her
weeping
so
i
believe
i
have
about
finished
my
narrative
i
really
did
love
that
girl
dearly
but
her
father
did
not
like
me
now
scottie
tell
me
your
love
you
have
knocked
the
foundation
from
under
my
story
for
you
have
told
it
yourself
and
i
must
ask
you
to
give
me
back
my
glove
it
is
mine
and
here
is
the
scar
made
by
the
bite
of
the
good
heavens
have
i
the
honor
to
again
meet
miss
kate
darlington
if
you
will
leave
out
the
honor
part
i
will
answer
yes
and
i
have
the
pleasure
to
meet
captain
ralleigh
burk
i
you
have
guessed
my
name
at
any
rate
but
was
it
true
scottie
pardon
me
please
but
i
mean
to
call
you
scottie
all
the
time
for
i
like
it
that
you
did
love
me
oh
you
must
not
ask
impertinent
questions
you
know
we
were
joking
when
we
commenced
no
i
don
t
for
i
never
was
more
in
earnest
in
all
my
life
i
have
kissed
this
little
glove
a
thousand
times
and
the
dear
image
of
the
pearl
river
girl
has
been
indelibly
stamped
on
my
heart
it
has
been
two
years
since
i
last
saw
you
and
it
has
seemed
an
age
to
me
i
was
sure
that
you
were
going
to
marry
that
other
fellow
with
the
red
oh
no
i
detest
red
hair
and
then
i
never
could
marry
a
man
unless
i
loved
him
the
fact
is
it
wouldn
t
do
for
me
to
marry
at
all
for
i
have
such
a
oh
bother
the
temper
i
am
willing
to
risk
it
laying
all
jokes
aside
i
love
you
devotedly
and
won
t
you
promise
to
be
my
wife
if
i
lose
my
temper
and
break
your
head
with
the
broom
handle
you
won
t
beat
me
if
i
break
up
the
furniture
while
in
a
passion
you
ll
go
and
buy
more
very
well
i
ll
take
your
case
under
advisement
and
give
you
an
answer
when
we
get
back
home
provided
you
don
t
conclude
to
withdraw
the
proposition
before
it
is
too
see
here
scottie
this
is
a
matter
of
too
much
importance
to
me
to
be
made
the
subject
of
a
joke
i
don
t
believe
you
mean
to
wound
my
feelings
yet
i
had
rather
you
would
not
use
so
much
levity
about
it
i
loved
you
at
first
sight
and
meant
to
ask
you
then
to
marry
me
but
your
father
seemed
to
dislike
me
so
that
i
was
in
the
first
place
burk
pshaw
scottie
don
t
call
me
burk
but
call
me
if
it
pleases
you
then
be
it
so
well
ralleigh
burk
in
the
first
place
i
am
not
joking
and
in
the
second
place
you
were
very
much
mistaken
when
you
concluded
that
my
father
disliked
you
he
had
a
supreme
contempt
for
what
he
called
oh
yes
i
see
and
he
set
me
down
in
his
mind
as
a
i
don
t
say
that
mind
you
but
he
looked
upon
you
as
the
villagers
did
on
the
old
dog
tray
who
was
found
in
bad
company
you
see
how
it
is
don
t
you
i
think
i
well
now
i
think
my
father
would
forgive
you
if
you
could
satisfy
him
that
you
had
quit
politics
and
gone
into
some
legitimate
do
you
indeed
how
kind
that
would
be
of
him
but
suppose
i
had
not
quit
politics
and
that
i
had
not
gone
into
any
legitimate
business
in
fact
suppose
it
should
appear
that
i
have
not
gone
into
anything
except
debt
i
think
it
would
prevent
your
going
into
our
then
i
suppose
he
would
not
object
to
my
going
head
foremost
into
the
mississippi
river
oh
by
no
means
i
think
he
would
rather
see
you
do
that
than
to
see
you
in
the
mississippi
and
may
i
ask
which
catastrophe
would
be
most
to
your
liking
the
cold
water
treatment
by
long
thank
you
i
must
say
that
i
admire
your
candor
but
not
your
spoken
like
a
man
i
glory
in
your
grit
you
re
on
my
platform
for
i
have
sworn
never
to
marry
a
man
unless
i
loved
scottie
you
are
a
little
darling
and
that
s
a
fact
and
i
want
you
to
try
to
love
me
if
you
can
and
if
you
can
t
just
tell
me
so
and
i
ll
either
go
to
the
bottom
of
the
river
or
to
the
mississippi
legislature
and
never
bother
you
any
hold
your
head
down
so
i
can
whisper
something
in
your
ear
i
don
t
think
you
will
have
to
drown
yourself
or
go
to
the
no
oh
won
t
that
be
jolly
you
have
removed
a
mountain
from
my
mind
let
us
go
dance
a
while
else
i
ll
do
something
you
talk
as
if
you
hadn
t
been
doing
that
all
the
evening
but
you
will
excuse
me
for
i
don
t
wish
to
dance
i
like
to
gaze
out
on
the
bright
water
and
see
the
moonbeams
dancing
on
it
i
like
to
feel
the
soft
balmy
air
as
it
kisses
my
cheeks
i
like
to
feel
the
gentle
motion
of
the
boat
and
watch
the
white
waves
of
steam
as
they
go
rolling
up
from
the
pipes
it
is
so
sweet
to
sit
here
and
listen
to
the
soft
notes
of
the
music
as
it
comes
stealing
up
from
the
saloon
and
mingling
with
the
dull
sound
of
the
puffing
pipes
i
love
to
listen
to
the
regular
clatter
of
the
wheels
they
make
such
pleasant
music
as
they
strike
the
water
the
fact
is
i
am
very
happy
and
could
sit
here
and
dream
all
night
without
going
to
sleep
oh
these
day
dreams
how
delightful
they
are
i
am
in
one
of
those
dreamy
moods
now
and
wouldn
t
exchange
that
feeling
for
anything
on
earth
all
right
scottie
i
think
i
ll
join
you
in
a
dream
or
two
but
i
am
so
happy
i
can
not
be
but
you
must
be
still
if
you
remain
here
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
have
a
dream
and
don
t
mean
to
be
disturbed
there
now
take
a
seat
and
let
us
watch
the
moon
till
she
passes
that
cloud
scottie
let
the
moon
alone
it
is
a
fickle
planet
anyway
and
i
am
afraid
you
will
learn
its
bad
habits
if
you
will
do
me
the
honor
to
take
my
arm
we
will
have
a
stroll
we
can
quarrel
as
well
while
walking
as
we
can
while
sitting
i
suppose
i
will
have
to
do
it
as
there
is
no
getting
rid
of
you
but
i
want
you
to
tell
me
if
you
have
made
any
new
discoveries
in
regard
to
the
black
domino
nothing
of
any
consequence
only
it
is
certain
that
she
is
watching
ingomar
in
such
a
way
as
to
convince
me
that
she
is
shadowing
him
for
some
purpose
my
spy
has
been
very
vigilant
but
has
encountered
many
difficulties
the
black
domino
seems
to
be
suspicious
of
every
one
who
approaches
her
and
positively
refuses
to
be
interviewed
when
she
retires
to
her
she
always
locks
the
door
and
don
t
even
let
the
enter
while
she
is
there
this
fact
alone
is
enough
to
convince
me
that
she
has
a
secret
the
tells
me
that
she
heard
the
black
domino
whispering
to
the
old
gentleman
with
the
long
beard
this
morning
she
was
not
close
enough
to
hear
all
that
was
said
but
she
heard
the
woman
say
that
she
was
determined
to
end
this
intolerable
suspense
very
soon
there
appeared
to
be
a
difference
of
opinion
between
the
old
man
and
the
black
domino
and
the
said
she
thought
that
they
were
quarreling
however
as
to
that
she
was
not
very
positive
what
do
you
think
it
all
means
scottie
why
do
you
ask
me
such
a
question
when
you
know
i
am
dying
of
that
terrible
disease
so
prevalent
among
our
sex
known
as
curiosity
what
wouldn
t
i
give
to
know
who
and
what
she
is
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
were
to
try
she
might
find
out
it
does
look
so
but
nevertheless
she
has
not
done
it
that
is
to
say
she
has
done
comparatively
nothing
but
we
have
not
abandoned
the
field
yet
by
a
great
anything
further
from
the
mississippi
detectives
yet
no
only
a
confirmation
of
what
we
have
heard
heretofore
it
is
certain
that
ingomar
is
to
be
arrested
as
soon
as
the
boat
arrives
at
vicksburg
i
regret
to
tell
you
that
we
shall
have
to
part
with
him
i
hope
he
will
have
time
to
finish
his
story
before
he
is
arrested
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
i
think
it
is
our
duty
to
tell
him
all
we
have
heard
no
no
that
would
not
only
be
aiding
a
criminal
to
escape
but
it
would
be
to
some
extent
criminal
on
our
part
no
let
us
have
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
it
but
scottie
haven
t
you
told
the
queen
already
what
you
know
about
ingomar
no
not
a
word
i
ll
have
you
to
know
i
am
no
talebearer
didn
t
i
promise
you
i
would
keep
the
secret
of
course
i
did
and
then
how
dare
you
ask
me
such
a
question
i
beg
pardon
i
ought
to
be
pitched
overboard
don
t
you
think
i
ought
certainly
i
do
and
should
go
about
having
it
done
but
it
would
make
all
the
fish
quite
perhaps
it
would
but
i
have
no
idea
of
being
pitched
into
the
river
i
know
i
shall
have
pleasant
dreams
while
the
dear
image
of
some
one
will
float
before
my
ivanhoe
then
bade
scottie
and
retired
to
his
while
his
heart
swelled
with
joy
he
had
at
last
found
a
haven
of
rest
for
his
heart
which
for
two
years
had
been
worrying
itself
about
the
beautiful
girl
from
pearl
river
chapter
xviii
immediately
after
breakfast
next
morning
queen
mary
and
her
party
at
the
usual
place
where
ingomar
was
ordered
to
resume
his
narrative
all
of
the
maskers
were
in
their
places
eager
to
hear
the
balance
of
the
story
and
ingomar
without
loss
of
time
began
as
follows
as
soon
as
dabbs
and
tadpoddle
left
the
office
harry
began
to
pace
the
floor
rapidly
with
his
head
hanging
on
his
breast
while
i
could
see
from
the
working
of
the
muscles
of
his
face
that
he
was
making
a
desperate
effort
to
get
his
feelings
under
control
after
walking
the
floor
for
some
time
in
silence
he
abruptly
confronted
me
and
fixed
his
eyes
on
me
as
if
to
read
my
thoughts
then
said
she
is
guilty
and
my
career
is
nearly
ended
i
can
not
survive
it
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
do
not
wish
to
for
i
never
shall
have
confidence
in
any
woman
again
i
shall
even
lose
confidence
in
stop
harry
i
pray
you
don
t
talk
so
you
will
be
sorry
for
this
one
of
these
days
let
us
not
abandon
all
hopes
yet
it
is
possible
that
this
is
a
mistake
after
no
no
i
understand
your
motive
and
appreciate
it
but
it
is
useless
to
dodge
the
question
viola
is
lost
lost
forever
oh
god
have
mercy
on
this
poor
girl
but
for
the
sin
of
the
thing
i
would
kill
myself
now
and
be
rid
of
this
intolerable
suffering
there
is
a
burning
fire
in
my
bosom
and
i
can
feel
its
consuming
flames
devouring
my
vitals
oh
how
i
did
love
that
girl
how
i
worshiped
her
so
beautiful
so
enchanting
how
could
one
so
lovely
be
so
wicked
my
doom
is
sealed
the
blow
to
me
is
fatal
i
feel
it
here
let
it
come
the
sooner
the
better
bowles
must
die
though
it
is
a
mystery
to
me
why
such
men
should
be
tolerated
in
a
city
like
this
where
they
can
rob
and
murder
men
and
ruin
innocent
girls
with
impunity
if
a
poor
wretch
whose
wife
and
children
are
starving
steals
a
side
of
bacon
to
keep
the
dear
ones
alive
he
is
hurried
off
to
the
penitentiary
in
time
but
the
thief
who
steals
his
thousands
corrupts
youth
ruins
young
girls
and
dines
his
friends
is
permitted
to
walk
the
streets
as
the
lion
of
the
day
it
is
not
only
so
in
memphis
but
i
am
told
it
is
so
in
many
other
cities
how
such
unscrupulous
wretches
should
be
permitted
to
ply
their
avocations
of
robbery
among
people
who
make
pretensions
to
civilization
is
a
puzzle
to
me
but
i
mean
to
have
a
settlement
with
bowles
he
is
the
same
fellow
who
many
years
ago
insulted
lottie
at
our
camp
then
committed
perjury
when
i
was
on
trial
i
have
that
little
affair
scored
against
him
but
that
is
nothing
compared
with
the
late
harry
i
would
advise
you
not
to
let
viola
know
that
you
think
she
is
guilty
because
if
you
do
she
certainly
will
discard
you
forever
i
am
sure
she
never
would
forgive
you
the
second
time
you
have
not
forgotten
what
trouble
you
had
to
get
her
to
pardon
your
first
error
and
you
had
better
be
very
cautious
how
you
act
now
she
is
as
proud
and
sensitive
as
you
are
and
if
you
offend
her
again
she
never
will
forgive
i
will
under
no
circumstances
attempt
to
conceal
my
opinions
if
she
asks
me
for
the
truth
you
may
be
assured
she
will
hear
it
i
adhere
to
the
doctrine
that
honesty
is
the
best
policy
i
never
have
told
a
deliberate
falsehood
and
never
would
it
not
be
best
then
for
you
not
to
see
her
until
we
know
more
about
the
case
for
she
will
be
certain
to
find
out
what
you
think
and
then
my
word
for
it
she
will
discard
do
you
think
i
would
care
if
she
did
you
don
t
imagine
that
i
expect
to
marry
her
do
you
but
suppose
you
go
and
tell
her
you
think
she
is
guilty
and
then
afterward
when
it
is
too
late
you
find
out
that
she
is
innocent
don
t
you
see
what
an
awkward
predicament
you
then
would
be
in
eddie
please
don
t
try
to
deceive
me
you
know
she
is
guilty
is
not
the
proof
overwhelming
didn
t
i
cling
to
the
idea
of
her
innocence
until
the
last
prop
was
knocked
away
but
i
am
determined
to
see
her
and
demand
an
explanation
it
is
but
fair
to
give
her
a
chance
she
shall
know
what
we
have
heard
and
she
then
must
tell
what
she
knows
about
harry
you
will
live
to
regret
this
step
and
i
want
you
to
understand
that
you
take
it
contrary
to
my
advice
and
wishes
if
you
would
let
the
whole
matter
rest
in
the
hands
of
the
detectives
until
the
evidence
shall
be
brought
out
i
think
it
would
be
let
the
responsibility
rest
on
me
i
must
and
will
see
viola
once
more
and
then
leave
her
in
the
hands
of
him
who
knows
the
secrets
of
all
hearts
i
will
go
and
see
her
now
meantime
you
go
and
talk
to
rockland
and
don
t
think
about
me
at
all
i
must
now
steer
my
own
canoe
my
mind
is
made
up
and
no
power
on
earth
can
change
he
then
abruptly
left
the
office
and
went
toward
the
jail
i
trembled
to
see
the
strange
wild
look
in
his
eyes
as
he
passed
out
mischief
was
brewing
and
i
could
see
it
as
plain
as
daylight
but
how
to
prevent
it
i
knew
not
i
remained
in
my
seat
for
some
time
undecided
as
to
the
best
course
to
be
pursued
i
knew
that
i
must
act
promptly
but
what
or
how
to
do
i
could
not
decide
after
harry
had
been
gone
about
thirty
minutes
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
ought
to
go
and
talk
to
lottie
and
let
her
know
the
bad
news
we
had
heard
and
persuade
her
to
keep
harry
and
viola
apart
until
something
more
definite
could
be
ascertained
i
knew
that
if
harry
should
see
viola
while
his
mind
was
in
its
present
condition
something
serious
would
be
sure
to
transpire
i
hastened
to
the
jail
but
was
too
late
to
prevent
the
meeting
lottie
met
me
at
the
entrance
and
i
saw
from
her
looks
that
she
had
suspected
something
oh
eddie
she
said
as
she
held
out
both
hands
for
me
to
shake
what
on
earth
is
the
matter
with
harry
he
came
here
just
now
looking
for
all
the
world
just
like
a
ghost
he
was
as
pale
as
death
and
i
thought
he
was
going
to
fall
down
and
die
at
my
feet
he
staggered
from
one
side
of
the
hall
to
the
other
like
a
drunken
man
told
me
he
wished
to
be
alone
with
viola
and
requested
me
to
stay
out
of
the
room
until
he
called
me
his
eyes
showed
a
wild
unsettled
expression
such
as
i
have
seen
mad
men
have
what
does
it
mean
lottie
something
awful
has
happened
but
i
can
t
stop
to
tell
you
now
we
must
look
after
harry
get
him
away
from
here
as
soon
as
possible
go
in
you
must
persuade
him
to
go
home
with
good
heavens
did
you
hear
that
groan
that
was
viola
come
quick
i
followed
her
into
the
room
and
at
a
glance
perceived
that
we
had
come
too
late
the
mischief
had
been
done
that
harry
was
absolutely
crazy
for
the
time
being
was
as
plain
as
could
be
viola
was
leaning
against
the
pale
and
trembling
while
harry
was
passing
across
the
room
like
an
angry
tiger
in
its
cage
lottie
was
by
viola
s
side
in
an
instant
what
is
it
she
inquired
as
she
took
hold
of
her
arm
tell
me
what
has
happened
i
beseech
you
your
gallant
brother
there
i
think
could
tell
you
better
than
i
could
replied
viola
as
she
drew
herself
up
to
her
full
height
she
looked
like
a
queen
who
had
received
an
insult
from
one
of
her
subjects
such
a
look
of
scorn
as
she
cast
upon
harry
as
she
spoke
i
never
had
seen
flash
from
a
woman
s
eyes
before
her
cheeks
were
red
with
anger
and
her
frame
seemed
to
grow
taller
yes
lottie
your
gallant
brother
can
enlighten
you
as
to
what
has
then
addressing
herself
to
harry
she
said
why
wallingford
didn
t
you
tell
your
sister
how
you
sat
quietly
in
your
chair
and
heard
those
two
penitentiary
birds
say
that
i
was
the
mistress
of
a
blackleg
gambler
and
didn
t
kill
them
you
saved
my
life
when
i
was
a
child
and
i
thought
you
were
a
brave
hero
every
story
i
read
where
a
hero
was
described
i
coupled
your
name
with
and
my
childish
mind
pictured
you
as
greater
and
braver
than
all
of
them
i
loved
you
for
your
courage
i
thought
of
you
by
day
i
dreamed
about
you
at
night
my
love
grew
as
i
grew
until
my
poor
heart
was
full
to
overflowing
the
followers
in
mohammed
never
had
stronger
faith
in
him
than
i
had
in
you
your
image
floated
before
my
young
mind
as
my
beau
ideal
of
all
that
was
brave
noble
generous
and
kind
i
studied
by
day
and
by
night
in
order
to
make
myself
worthy
of
such
a
hero
my
love
grew
into
worship
and
if
every
man
woman
and
child
on
earth
had
told
me
you
were
not
a
brave
generous
hero
i
would
not
have
believed
it
i
wore
your
image
next
to
my
heart
and
no
heathen
ever
worshiped
his
idol
with
half
the
devotion
that
i
worshiped
you
my
love
was
my
life
it
was
my
happiness
it
was
my
religion
it
was
my
all
you
told
me
you
loved
me
you
took
me
to
your
heart
and
whispered
sweet
words
of
love
into
my
ear
you
almost
killed
me
with
joy
then
you
cast
me
off
and
declared
that
you
were
joking
and
that
you
never
could
think
of
marrying
me
i
was
crazed
with
grief
and
as
soon
as
i
got
so
i
could
bear
the
awful
affliction
you
came
and
renewed
the
protestations
of
love
you
offered
excuses
for
your
former
conduct
i
believed
you
you
swore
in
the
most
solemn
language
that
you
always
had
loved
me
i
credited
it
and
you
asked
me
to
be
your
wife
i
yielded
because
i
loved
nay
the
word
love
is
too
weak
a
term
to
be
used
i
worshiped
you
i
adored
you
i
thought
my
love
was
returned
i
thought
you
were
perfection
itself
in
view
of
all
these
things
how
could
you
sit
and
hear
my
name
blackened
by
a
pair
of
penitentiary
convicts
and
not
kill
them
you
heard
them
say
i
was
the
mistress
of
a
common
blackleg
gambler
and
did
not
resent
it
is
this
the
brave
hero
whose
picture
i
have
worn
on
my
heart
for
ten
long
years
how
could
i
have
been
so
blinded
as
to
worship
such
an
object
and
then
to
cap
the
climax
you
come
here
and
ask
me
to
explain
why
i
was
in
the
habit
of
visiting
the
apartments
of
bowles
continually
leave
me
and
my
affairs
in
the
hands
of
god
to
him
i
will
render
an
account
of
my
conduct
in
this
business
but
to
you
never
i
have
no
fears
as
to
my
fate
death
to
me
now
would
be
welcome
why
should
i
wish
to
live
where
no
one
will
befriend
me
let
them
hang
me
high
as
haman
let
my
name
be
bandied
about
the
streets
as
the
vilest
of
the
vile
why
should
i
care
since
the
only
one
i
loved
or
cared
for
thinks
me
guilty
let
them
hang
me
first
and
then
throw
my
body
in
a
felon
s
grave
god
who
knows
the
secrets
of
all
hearts
will
take
care
of
my
soul
you
may
go
now
wallingford
i
have
no
more
to
say
only
to
demand
that
you
desist
from
any
further
interference
in
my
affairs
make
out
an
account
of
all
expenses
you
have
incurred
and
present
them
to
my
guardian
and
i
will
see
that
they
are
paid
you
may
go
now
as
i
wish
to
be
left
if
harry
heard
what
she
had
been
saying
he
paid
but
little
attention
to
it
but
when
she
ceased
instead
of
leaving
the
room
as
she
had
ordered
him
to
do
he
stood
like
a
statue
gazing
vacantly
before
him
mr
wallingford
again
i
tell
you
i
wish
to
be
left
as
she
spoke
she
pointed
toward
the
door
and
her
manner
was
such
as
to
convince
me
that
it
would
be
better
for
harry
to
leave
acting
upon
that
conclusion
i
led
him
from
the
room
and
went
with
him
to
his
office
he
spoke
not
nor
did
he
make
any
objections
to
being
taken
away
in
fact
i
didn
t
think
he
exactly
comprehended
what
had
been
said
though
he
afterward
spoke
of
it
as
if
it
were
a
painful
dream
i
had
often
seen
him
under
the
influence
of
excitement
but
i
had
never
beheld
him
in
such
a
state
as
he
was
then
and
i
was
afraid
to
leave
him
alone
for
i
imagined
that
he
would
seek
bowles
immediately
rockland
came
into
the
office
soon
after
we
arrived
and
i
sought
a
private
interview
with
him
and
in
as
few
words
as
possible
informed
him
what
had
happened
and
requested
him
to
try
to
get
harry
home
as
soon
as
he
could
rockland
was
deeply
moved
when
he
began
to
realize
the
situation
he
loved
harry
devotedly
and
was
as
much
alarmed
at
his
condition
as
i
was
he
at
once
requested
him
to
accompany
him
home
harry
followed
rockland
without
objection
and
i
went
back
to
the
jail
at
once
to
see
lottie
i
wanted
to
have
a
talk
with
her
about
the
new
turn
matters
were
taking
for
i
had
more
confidence
in
her
cool
judgment
than
all
the
rest
she
was
the
only
one
of
us
who
could
look
at
both
sides
of
a
case
with
an
impartial
eye
the
fact
is
she
had
more
sound
practical
judgment
than
harry
and
i
put
together
nothing
could
throw
her
temper
off
its
guard
and
i
knew
that
i
must
look
to
her
for
help
because
harry
was
no
longer
to
be
depended
on
as
soon
as
i
entered
the
gate
in
front
of
the
jail
lottie
came
out
of
viola
s
room
and
beckoned
me
to
her
side
don
t
go
in
there
i
wish
to
have
a
private
chat
with
you
viola
is
asleep
now
i
had
to
send
for
doctor
dodson
soon
after
you
and
harry
left
the
doctor
was
obliged
to
give
her
an
opiate
before
he
could
get
her
to
sleep
he
fears
there
is
danger
of
brain
fever
but
thinks
it
may
be
avoided
by
proper
treatment
why
did
you
let
harry
come
here
when
you
knew
what
a
condition
his
mind
was
in
i
did
my
very
best
to
keep
him
away
but
he
wouldn
t
listen
to
me
i
think
he
is
mad
i
told
him
above
all
things
not
to
tell
viola
what
he
had
but
what
is
it
you
have
heard
you
must
remember
that
i
am
totally
ignorant
as
to
the
cause
of
all
this
i
then
gave
her
a
full
statement
of
the
facts
as
detailed
to
us
by
dabbs
and
tadpoddle
i
saw
a
strange
light
flash
from
her
beautiful
eyes
and
her
cheeks
flushed
instantly
with
a
rush
of
red
blood
to
them
her
pretty
little
mouth
was
at
once
drawn
down
at
both
corners
and
you
and
brother
harry
swallowed
this
magnificent
story
as
a
child
of
five
years
would
the
hobgoblin
story
told
by
its
nurse
that
is
you
believed
it
of
lottie
how
could
we
help
believing
it
when
the
proof
was
so
plain
what
was
viola
doing
with
bowles
letter
in
her
dress
pocket
what
was
she
visiting
his
apartments
at
the
dark
hours
of
night
for
were
they
not
planning
schemes
of
murder
does
not
the
letter
prove
this
beyond
all
question
what
is
the
use
of
clinging
to
an
idea
that
has
no
foundation
to
rest
on
if
i
owned
all
the
money
in
the
world
i
would
give
it
to
know
viola
was
not
eddie
i
love
you
too
much
i
wish
i
didn
t
for
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
give
you
a
real
good
scolding
but
how
can
i
have
the
heart
to
abuse
my
old
booby
when
i
love
him
so
but
let
me
tell
you
one
thing
now
and
be
very
sure
you
don
t
forget
it
if
ever
you
hint
or
insinuate
in
my
presence
again
that
you
think
viola
bramlett
is
anything
but
a
pure
honest
virtuous
persecuted
orphan
girl
i
ll
make
such
a
rattling
storm
in
your
ears
as
you
never
have
heard
in
all
the
days
of
your
if
i
were
to
see
her
murder
a
brigade
i
d
never
say
so
before
very
good
you
had
better
try
to
remember
that
for
i
tell
you
booby
i
know
her
to
be
innocent
and
that
is
not
all
by
a
long
jump
i
know
exactly
who
is
guilty
you
and
harry
imagine
yourselves
to
be
exceedingly
clever
you
bring
penitentiary
birds
from
philadelphia
and
pay
them
large
rewards
to
blacken
the
name
of
a
pure
honest
girl
i
declare
you
ought
to
congratulate
yourselves
on
the
success
of
your
enterprise
lottie
for
heaven
s
sake
if
you
know
who
committed
that
cruel
murder
why
do
you
let
viola
remain
in
jail
why
don
t
you
expose
the
guilty
one
and
let
the
innocent
one
go
free
i
shall
do
that
at
the
proper
time
i
have
got
a
net
set
and
the
guilty
one
is
partially
entangled
in
it
now
but
the
time
has
not
yet
come
to
make
the
final
drag
you
and
harry
have
been
on
the
wrong
trail
all
the
time
and
so
have
your
clever
why
don
t
you
tell
harry
and
me
all
about
the
case
so
we
can
help
you
i
mean
to
make
you
help
me
without
telling
you
anything
because
i
think
it
is
best
to
keep
my
secrets
from
you
and
as
to
brother
harry
he
never
had
the
starch
taken
out
of
him
until
his
ungovernable
pride
has
caused
all
this
trouble
but
i
think
he
will
not
ride
such
a
tall
horse
any
more
he
is
a
dear
brother
but
he
never
has
put
the
curb
on
his
temper
in
fact
he
never
has
tried
to
control
his
passions
and
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
no
one
can
be
happy
who
can
t
manage
his
lottie
where
did
you
manage
to
pick
up
such
a
store
of
good
sense
it
sounds
like
inspiration
i
know
it
can
t
be
my
love
for
you
that
makes
me
think
like
that
it
is
simply
because
it
is
not
at
all
i
am
nothing
but
a
simple
girl
but
i
have
always
tried
to
command
my
mind
and
through
it
control
my
bad
passions
and
to
some
extent
have
succeeded
that
s
all
there
is
of
will
you
tell
me
whether
bowles
committed
the
murder
or
not
he
did
not
though
he
is
as
guilty
as
the
one
who
did
and
i
will
have
the
proof
on
him
when
the
trial
comes
off
i
want
the
grand
jury
to
find
a
bill
against
viola
because
her
name
has
been
stained
with
the
charge
and
these
slanderous
reports
have
been
whispered
about
the
streets
against
her
and
she
shall
be
vindicated
in
open
court
and
i
assure
you
her
fair
name
will
shine
so
brightly
that
no
spot
will
be
left
on
it
the
more
i
know
of
her
the
better
i
love
her
and
i
know
her
to
be
as
pure
as
the
falling
snow
she
concurs
in
my
views
as
regards
a
public
trial
and
will
not
shrink
when
the
time
comes
she
is
a
greater
heroine
than
any
one
would
suppose
who
is
not
acquainted
with
her
private
who
is
assisting
you
to
look
up
the
evidence
in
the
case
that
s
one
of
my
secrets
which
i
don
t
mean
to
tell
you
just
now
but
it
is
one
who
can
beat
your
philadelphia
detective
very
why
not
tell
harry
that
you
know
viola
to
be
innocent
don
t
you
know
the
idea
that
she
is
guilty
is
killing
him
i
am
afraid
that
he
will
seek
a
quarrel
with
bowles
and
either
kill
him
or
get
killed
i
did
tell
him
that
i
knew
she
was
not
guilty
and
i
told
you
the
same
thing
yet
both
of
you
were
ready
to
credit
the
first
thing
you
heard
against
her
i
would
have
revealed
everything
to
him
but
i
could
not
depend
on
his
judgment
when
he
is
so
flustered
i
was
afraid
he
would
act
too
hastily
and
thereby
overthrow
the
plans
we
had
set
on
foot
to
entrap
the
guilty
parties
i
yet
fear
that
he
will
commit
some
rash
act
which
will
frighten
the
real
murderers
and
prevent
us
from
securing
the
proof
necessary
to
convict
our
uncle
has
written
him
to
come
to
california
and
i
think
we
had
better
get
him
to
go
at
once
uncle
stanley
s
health
has
failed
and
he
wants
harry
to
go
there
to
help
him
wind
up
his
business
so
he
can
come
here
to
live
he
urges
harry
to
come
without
delay
and
the
best
thing
we
can
do
is
to
persuade
him
to
go
at
once
he
could
get
back
in
six
months
and
by
that
time
viola
s
innocence
will
be
established
and
then
we
will
all
be
happy
once
more
you
had
better
see
rockland
on
the
subject
and
ask
him
to
aid
you
in
persuading
harry
to
go
at
once
in
the
first
place
it
is
his
duty
to
go
and
help
our
uncle
while
he
is
unable
to
look
after
his
own
business
and
in
the
next
place
it
will
furnish
brother
something
to
employ
his
mind
and
keep
it
from
the
subject
that
is
destroying
his
happiness
if
he
stays
here
he
will
be
sure
to
do
something
rash
therefore
you
must
not
lose
a
moment
until
you
get
him
do
you
think
viola
ever
will
forgive
harry
what
a
dear
old
booby
you
are
did
you
ever
hear
of
a
woman
s
forsaking
a
man
when
she
once
loved
him
truly
it
shows
how
little
you
know
about
a
woman
s
heart
i
suppose
men
judge
women
by
their
own
hearts
but
let
me
tell
you
that
the
heart
of
a
woman
is
no
more
like
that
of
a
man
than
day
is
like
night
man
s
heart
is
as
fickle
and
unreliable
as
the
moon
and
will
change
as
often
but
once
let
a
woman
give
her
heart
away
to
a
man
and
he
has
it
always
he
may
drag
her
down
to
the
lowest
precincts
of
misery
and
degradation
and
she
will
cling
to
and
love
him
still
he
may
beat
her
he
may
starve
her
he
may
disgrace
her
but
she
will
never
cease
to
love
him
she
will
go
with
him
to
a
loathsome
dungeon
she
will
follow
him
to
the
gallows
and
when
his
neck
is
broken
by
the
law
for
crimes
committed
she
will
weep
over
his
dead
body
and
bury
her
broken
heart
in
a
felon
s
grave
with
the
unworthy
man
she
loves
how
is
it
with
a
man
let
the
slightest
breath
of
suspicion
blow
upon
the
woman
he
loves
and
he
forsakes
her
at
lottie
do
you
think
that
anything
ever
could
happen
that
would
make
me
forsake
you
yes
a
hundred
things
could
happen
that
would
make
you
hate
me
though
i
think
you
are
the
best
sample
of
the
lot
and
if
you
should
beat
and
starve
me
i
should
be
fool
enough
to
go
on
loving
you
just
the
lottie
darling
if
ever
i
do
anything
intentionally
to
cause
you
pain
i
shall
expect
satan
to
get
my
unworthy
soul
and
roast
it
in
his
hottest
blazes
but
candidly
tell
me
lottie
dear
do
you
really
think
viola
ever
will
become
reconciled
with
harry
you
know
she
is
as
proud
as
he
is
and
i
never
saw
her
in
such
a
rage
as
she
was
that
s
all
you
know
about
it
why
sir
in
five
minutes
after
harry
left
her
she
broke
completely
down
fell
on
the
bed
and
wept
like
a
child
if
he
had
come
back
then
he
might
have
taken
her
in
his
arms
with
impunity
she
would
have
nestled
her
head
on
his
bosom
and
begged
him
to
forgive
her
instead
of
expecting
him
to
beg
her
pardon
the
truth
of
it
is
she
is
crazy
about
him
and
would
die
if
he
were
to
abandon
her
she
is
too
good
for
this
wicked
world
i
must
say
that
they
are
both
very
different
from
other
people
they
puzzle
and
perplex
me
sometimes
they
are
as
gentle
and
submissive
as
young
lambs
then
again
they
remind
me
of
a
tornado
sweeping
everything
to
destruction
as
it
goes
sometimes
they
resemble
the
smooth
calm
bosom
of
a
lake
then
they
appear
again
like
the
boisterous
billows
of
the
ocean
when
lashed
into
fury
by
the
true
enough
eddie
but
it
is
because
they
love
each
other
so
much
if
they
did
not
love
so
strongly
they
would
be
less
why
is
it
that
you
and
i
are
getting
along
so
smoothly
and
nicely
that
is
owing
to
the
fact
that
no
trouble
has
come
across
our
path
but
suppose
i
were
in
jail
charged
with
murder
and
you
were
to
tell
me
to
my
face
that
you
thought
me
guilty
don
t
you
think
you
would
start
a
pretty
extensive
whirlwind
if
i
were
to
do
such
a
cowardly
thing
it
ought
to
be
a
tornado
one
that
would
blow
my
worthless
carcass
out
of
the
don
t
make
so
many
rash
remarks
you
know
it
is
generally
understood
that
the
course
of
true
love
never
runs
smooth
we
may
have
stormy
weather
yet
before
the
voyage
is
ended
happiness
like
ours
is
too
great
to
last
i
m
afraid
but
enough
of
this
now
you
must
go
to
harry
and
remain
with
him
until
you
get
him
off
to
california
then
come
back
to
me
i
wish
to
send
you
on
a
short
journey
on
business
of
vast
tell
me
where
it
is
you
wish
me
to
go
and
what
you
want
me
to
go
for
so
that
i
can
have
something
to
think
about
it
is
so
pleasant
to
be
thinking
of
some
way
to
serve
as
soon
as
we
can
get
harry
started
i
shall
send
you
to
vicksburg
mississippi
on
business
connected
with
viola
s
case
you
see
as
i
have
already
informed
you
i
am
playing
lawyer
and
detective
both
there
is
certain
evidence
at
vicksburg
that
is
essential
in
this
affair
and
you
must
go
there
to
secure
it
i
think
i
may
safely
trust
you
thus
you
may
trust
me
implicitly
in
everything
lottie
darling
and
i
ll
prove
worthy
of
the
trust
but
have
you
any
objections
to
telling
me
now
the
nature
of
the
evidence
you
expect
me
to
secure
there
is
a
certain
woman
in
this
city
who
formerly
resided
at
or
near
vicksburg
whose
antecedents
i
wish
to
know
something
then
you
think
it
was
a
woman
who
poisoned
young
bramlett
what
are
you
talking
about
i
said
nothing
of
the
sort
you
must
obey
orders
and
not
be
so
inquisitive
a
good
soldier
you
know
always
obeys
orders
without
inquiring
the
reason
of
their
very
good
you
issue
orders
and
leave
the
rest
to
me
and
i
ll
bring
up
my
part
of
the
job
all
right
but
what
is
the
name
of
the
person
whose
history
you
want
she
has
so
many
names
that
you
will
find
the
greatest
difficulty
arises
from
that
fact
though
you
must
find
out
her
real
name
at
all
hazards
in
order
to
do
this
you
must
discover
who
are
her
parents
and
it
may
be
necessary
to
go
to
other
places
besides
vicksburg
before
you
accomplish
that
she
came
from
vicksburg
to
memphis
how
long
she
had
been
residing
there
i
do
not
know
but
suppose
you
are
detective
enough
to
find
out
who
she
is
and
where
she
was
born
and
raised
but
you
must
mind
and
not
let
any
one
know
your
business
because
everything
must
be
worked
secretly
this
woman
claims
to
be
a
native
of
mississippi
and
was
known
by
the
name
of
helen
herndon
when
she
came
to
this
city
that
is
she
was
traveling
under
that
name
while
coming
here
but
she
dropped
it
and
took
another
when
she
arrived
here
now
you
will
probably
find
that
helen
herndon
is
not
her
real
name
but
it
is
very
likely
that
she
has
resided
in
vicksburg
under
that
name
this
will
aid
you
to
determine
who
she
really
is
the
main
point
to
be
gained
is
to
find
her
parents
and
get
the
full
history
of
her
childhood
i
suppose
her
age
now
is
not
over
thirty
and
she
has
been
here
five
years
she
must
have
covered
up
her
tracks
well
else
you
will
be
able
to
trace
her
back
to
her
parents
you
must
not
let
any
one
know
where
you
are
going
nor
what
your
business
is
you
must
find
out
where
she
was
educated
and
by
the
by
she
has
been
well
educated
and
learn
everything
you
can
about
her
history
i
must
have
some
of
her
manuscript
and
this
of
course
you
can
get
if
you
can
find
her
parents
you
must
put
on
your
and
try
to
be
i
ll
try
of
course
but
do
you
think
i
can
succeed
ha
ha
dearest
you
have
the
right
to
make
sport
of
me
as
much
as
you
please
and
i
rather
think
i
like
i
built
several
magnificent
castles
as
i
passed
along
the
street
from
the
jail
to
rockland
s
house
i
can
t
say
that
i
absolutely
completed
any
one
of
those
splendid
buildings
because
my
mind
would
become
confused
when
i
was
about
to
put
on
the
cornice
or
the
dome
or
hoist
the
columns
and
i
would
find
that
something
was
lacking
to
make
the
exact
finish
a
crack
in
the
wall
would
appear
or
a
defect
in
the
foundation
a
column
would
tipple
down
the
dome
would
lean
over
to
one
side
turrets
were
too
flat
the
windows
too
short
something
was
sure
to
happen
to
prevent
me
from
making
an
absolute
finish
of
my
great
work
when
i
went
to
rockland
i
found
him
in
his
library
busy
as
usual
with
great
heaps
of
papers
before
him
which
he
was
examining
one
by
one
i
made
known
to
him
the
object
of
my
visit
told
him
lottie
s
views
and
requested
his
advice
and
assistance
to
get
harry
off
to
california
as
soon
as
possible
that
is
another
proof
of
lottie
s
good
sense
demar
the
fact
is
sir
that
girl
is
a
mystery
anyway
i
can
t
understand
where
she
managed
to
gather
up
so
much
good
sound
practical
common
sense
it
is
true
she
reads
a
great
deal
and
has
always
been
very
industrious
but
sir
i
believe
she
is
the
most
talented
woman
i
ever
knew
why
sir
would
you
believe
it
she
has
made
out
many
a
brief
for
me
hunted
up
the
law
applicable
to
the
case
and
arranged
everything
as
well
as
i
could
do
it
myself
for
instance
look
at
that
brief
there
will
you
she
did
that
and
she
did
it
as
quickly
as
any
lawyer
could
have
done
it
she
copies
all
my
papers
keeps
my
books
and
clerks
for
me
generally
demar
i
don
t
like
to
let
you
have
her
at
all
and
if
i
thought
you
would
take
her
away
from
me
i
should
be
tempted
to
break
off
the
it
pleases
me
beyond
measure
to
hear
you
praise
lottie
so
for
she
deserves
it
but
i
shall
never
part
her
from
you
if
you
prefer
that
we
should
stay
here
i
know
that
she
could
not
be
happy
if
she
thought
you
were
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
demar
for
making
that
promise
because
i
don
t
see
how
we
could
bear
to
part
with
our
darling
i
know
i
shall
miss
her
valuable
services
as
my
it
is
not
my
intention
rockland
to
deprive
you
of
her
services
so
long
as
it
may
be
agreeable
to
her
to
aid
you
my
aim
will
be
to
make
her
happy
and
i
dare
say
she
would
prefer
to
continue
to
help
you
i
think
that
this
is
the
place
where
she
managed
to
gather
so
much
useful
knowledge
of
the
law
as
well
as
a
great
store
of
general
information
she
has
been
with
you
so
much
and
heard
you
expound
the
law
to
others
so
often
that
she
has
got
her
mind
well
stored
with
its
probably
that
is
true
to
some
extent
but
she
possesses
an
extraordinary
mind
demar
you
have
been
quite
lucky
to
win
the
heart
of
such
a
woman
indeed
you
have
sir
you
have
achieved
a
great
victory
she
is
a
valuable
prize
i
assure
i
am
sensible
of
the
fact
sir
and
shall
endeavor
to
make
her
life
a
happy
one
i
feel
thankful
to
providence
for
bestowing
such
a
blessing
on
me
humble
and
unworthy
as
i
am
but
if
a
life
of
devotion
to
her
can
make
her
happy
she
shall
certainly
be
enough
of
this
demar
i
could
talk
about
lottie
all
day
but
we
must
not
neglect
other
business
you
were
about
to
mention
some
newly
discovered
evidence
that
had
been
brought
to
light
in
miss
bramlett
s
case
i
shall
be
glad
to
hear
anything
in
her
i
am
very
sorry
to
be
compelled
to
say
that
this
newly
found
evidence
is
anything
but
favorable
to
her
to
the
contrary
if
it
is
true
it
establishes
her
guilt
beyond
poor
girl
i
am
distressed
to
hear
it
but
let
me
know
all
at
i
then
proceeded
to
tell
him
everything
that
had
been
related
to
harry
and
me
by
dabbs
and
tadpoddle
that
proof
will
convict
her
beyond
question
unless
it
can
be
overthrown
by
other
proof
and
it
would
have
to
be
unquestionable
evidence
to
do
that
we
shall
be
driven
to
the
plea
of
insanity
this
is
the
and
is
rather
a
shaky
foundation
to
build
hopes
upon
it
is
most
unfortunate
that
harry
should
have
fallen
in
love
with
miss
bramlett
poor
fellow
it
is
a
heavy
blow
to
him
and
i
agree
with
you
as
to
the
propriety
of
getting
him
off
to
california
as
soon
as
possible
it
is
truly
his
duty
to
go
to
his
uncle
without
delay
and
i
shall
mention
the
subject
to
him
as
soon
as
his
mind
gets
composed
he
is
in
an
unsettled
condition
just
do
you
think
he
will
go
rockland
oh
yes
he
will
do
anything
i
request
him
to
he
has
been
a
kind
obedient
son
to
me
and
my
wishes
have
always
been
law
with
him
ah
me
i
love
the
dear
boy
and
it
is
causing
me
great
pain
to
see
him
suffering
so
he
seems
to
be
perfectly
reckless
since
miss
bramlett
s
troubles
began
neglects
his
duties
stares
wildly
at
space
for
hours
at
a
time
in
silence
eats
scarcely
anything
and
is
as
pale
as
a
ghost
his
mother
is
in
despair
about
it
and
a
general
gloom
pervades
the
premises
something
must
be
done
and
that
without
delay
he
shall
start
to
california
next
monday
that
will
rouse
him
and
take
his
mind
off
of
this
painful
having
finished
my
business
with
rockland
i
went
back
to
the
jail
to
report
progress

the
jail

interest
in
miss
bramlett

they
have
killed

poor
girl

their
infernal
tongues
ah
ha
eddie
my
boy

t
you

how
it
is
i
wish
their
tongues

and
nailed

the
jail

as
a
warning
to
meddlesome
gossips

what

a
little
breathing
spell
while
she

hateful
hag
has
sent
for
me
to
visit
her
professionally
ah
ha
my
boy
i
mean
to
send
you
in
my
place
she
is
the
very
sort
for
a
young
quack
to
practice
on
no
harm
done
if
he
kills
her
don
t
you
see
get
yourself
ready
to
go

boy

you
can

ll
find
a
charming
patient
my
boy
clattermouth
is
sure
to
be
there
they
are
always
together
birds
of
a
feather
you
know
how
it
is
yourself
ah
ha
eddie

boy

off
now
stuff
her
full
of
medicine
pour
in
the
calomel
till
you
salivate
her
that
s
as
nigh
salvation
as
she
will
ever
get
go
my
boy
cram
her
with
emetics
then
shovel
in
your
purgatives
don
t
kill
her
but
prostrate
her
stop
her
devilish
tongue
ah
ha
my
boy
don
t
you
see
go
go
of
course
i
went
and
when
i
entered
tadpoddle
s
house
i
was
immediately
ushered
into
miss
jemima
s
room
i
stood
in
the
door
a
moment
while
my
eyes
were
busy
taking
a
survey
of
the
room
and
its
contents
miss
jemima
tadpoddle
was
propped
up
in
bed
with
a
dozen
pillows
while
miss
jerusha
clattermouth
was
bathing
her
temples
with
and
the
sick
woman
s
mother
was
holding
a
smelling
bottle
to
her
nose
it
is
my
deliberate
opinion
that
if
shakespeare
had
seen
those
three
women
before
he
wrote
macbeth
he
would
have
made
a
better
job
of
it
especially
in
the
witch
department
a
feeling
of
disgust
crept
through
me
as
i
approached
the
bed
where
she
was
and
it
cost
me
an
effort
to
conceal
my
feelings
her
neck
was
not
quite
so
long
as
that
of
a
sandhill
crane
but
i
can
honestly
say
it
was
the
longest
neck
i
ever
saw
under
a
woman
s
head
and
it
appeared
to
be
entirely
constructed
of
little
round
cords
her
skin
was
as
white
as
snow
and
if
she
had
any
veins
in
her
body
they
were
not
visible
to
the
naked
eye
miss
clattermouth
was
by
no
means
like
miss
tadpoddle
in
fact
i
never
saw
two
people
less
alike
than
they
were
miss
clattermouth
was
a
little
woman
with
a
pug
nose
a
very
small
mouth
no
teeth
either
natural
or
artificial
and
the
thin
lips
appeared
to
be
at
a
loss
to
know
what
to
do
with
themselves
the
mouth
was
entirely
too
small
for
the
lips
hence
they
were
forced
to
double
themselves
up
or
rather
to
roll
into
little
folds
so
as
to
have
more
room
as
soon
as
i
was
able
to
get
in
a
word
i
inquired
of
miss
tadpoddle
the
nature
of
her
complaint
oh
doctor
i
am
so
glad
you
came
to
see
me
i
declare
i
thought
i
should
die
before
you
got
here
you
don
t
know
how
delighted
i
am
to
see
you
i
never
exaggerate
i
despise
exaggeration
it
is
my
character
to
despise
it
i
never
flatter
it
is
my
character
to
hate
flattery
you
may
rely
on
anything
i
say
doctor
for
i
never
use
extravagant
language
it
is
my
character
not
to
use
it
i
feel
so
much
better
since
you
came
your
cheerful
smile
has
almost
cured
me
i
m
sure
i
soon
shall
get
well
the
pleasure
it
gives
me
to
look
at
your
happy
face
is
much
better
than
medicine
sit
down
near
me
where
i
can
see
you
plainly
feel
my
pulse
it
is
much
more
regular
than
when
you
came
i
have
heard
so
much
about
you
doctor
demar
they
told
me
you
were
handsome
though
they
didn
t
do
you
justice
but
i
never
flatter
it
is
my
character
not
to
flatter
yet
i
never
saw
such
expressive
eyes
as
yours
my
brother
told
me
about
them
but
never
mind
me
you
know
a
woman
must
talk
oh
you
look
so
strong
and
healthy
how
i
envy
you
you
are
so
tall
and
handsome
pardon
my
enthusiasm
i
beg
you
but
i
mean
what
i
say
you
wish
to
know
what
is
the
matter
with
me
yes
of
course
you
do
well
i
mean
to
tell
you
oh
i
have
suffered
ten
thousand
deaths
since
yesterday
such
torture
no
poor
mortal
ever
suffered
before
how
i
survived
it
is
a
mystery
but
i
must
try
to
describe
my
sufferings
i
never
expected
to
see
another
day
i
had
a
horrible
pain
in
the
back
of
my
head
both
temples
ached
and
throbbed
all
day
and
all
night
my
back
felt
as
if
it
was
broken
in
the
middle
my
teeth
were
all
aching
at
once
a
kind
of
smothering
about
my
heart
with
darting
pains
continually
going
like
a
knife
through
my
breast
my
stomach
seemed
to
be
on
fire
while
my
extremities
were
freezing
my
throat
was
perfectly
raw
and
the
skin
has
all
peeled
off
my
tongue
every
bone
in
my
body
seemed
mashed
into
powder
my
eyeballs
felt
as
if
they
were
going
to
jump
out
of
my
head
i
had
the
in
both
ears
a
most
horrid
retching
about
the
stomach
i
had
neuralgia
in
my
left
jaw
and
a
burning
sensation
in
my
nostrils
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
was
quite
unlike
myself
do
pray
give
me
something
to
relieve
me
i
ll
die
i
know
i
will
if
you
don
t
that
interesting
female
then
fell
back
on
the
mountain
of
pillows
closed
her
eyes
and
heaved
a
deep
sigh
like
one
who
was
about
to
bid
the
world
a
final
farewell
i
want
it
to
be
distinctly
understood
that
i
did
not
intend
to
commit
murder
but
i
had
the
necessary
malice
in
me
miss
tadpoddle
had
maligned
miss
bramlett
and
she
had
slandered
everybody
else
in
memphis
she
had
offended
lottie
by
her
malicious
reports
concerning
viola
i
was
angry
because
lottie
was
displeased
and
here
is
the
soliloquy
that
i
had
with
myself
on
that
occasion
as
nigh
as
i
can
remember
it
very
well
my
charming
miss
tadpoddle
i
have
got
you
in
my
power
now
and
i
guess
i
ll
get
even
with
you
before
i
quit
you
you
want
medicine
do
you
very
good
you
shall
have
it
with
a
vengeance
i
ll
keep
your
tongue
silent
for
a
week
or
two
if
there
is
any
virtue
in
blisters
i
ll
physic
you
until
you
are
satisfied
this
was
the
first
patient
i
ever
had
and
i
meant
to
test
the
qualities
of
my
drugs
i
had
brought
my
case
of
medicines
with
me
and
was
prepared
not
only
to
prescribe
but
to
administer
the
drugs
i
covered
her
up
with
blisters
i
gave
her
an
emetic
i
put
bricks
to
her
feet
i
cupped
her
temples
the
fact
is
i
made
a
prescription
for
each
separate
pain
of
which
she
complained
and
with
the
aid
of
miss
clattermouth
i
managed
to
have
it
all
administered
then
i
sat
down
and
waited
for
the
result
old
lady
i
observed
to
myself
mentally
i
guess
you
ll
remain
quiet
for
a
few
days
now
you
won
t
trouble
miss
bramlett
soon
at
all
events
your
tongue
won
t
wag
quite
so
glibly
as
it
has
been
in
the
habit
of
doing
you
ll
wake
up
directly
if
i
am
not
well
sure
enough
she
did
wake
up
and
it
was
no
halfway
business
either
it
was
what
you
call
a
sensation
the
mustard
began
to
heat
her
up
the
emetic
commenced
business
the
hot
bricks
got
up
steam
in
fact
the
skirmish
commenced
all
along
the
line
but
when
the
pill
brigade
made
the
charge
the
engagement
became
general
the
contest
was
hot
and
loud
and
the
drugs
won
the
victory
and
miss
tadpoddle
was
saved
so
completely
cured
that
she
never
has
been
very
ill
since
my
reputation
as
a
physician
was
then
permanently
established
because
miss
tadpoddle
s
tongue
was
a
better
advertising
medium
than
the
new
york
herald
she
was
president
of
the
tramp
reform
association
then
she
was
a
working
member
of
many
other
benevolent
associations
she
made
it
her
daily
business
to
speak
of
my
vigorous
style
of
practice
i
was
certainly
well
prepared
to
treat
any
disease
because
the
experiments
i
had
made
on
miss
tadpoddle
had
enabled
me
to
test
the
qualities
of
all
the
drugs
known
to
the
profession
it
was
somewhere
about
ten
days
after
my
treatment
of
miss
tadpoddle
s
case
when
she
again
sent
for
me
i
found
her
in
bed
and
when
i
say
in
bed
i
mean
it
she
was
not
propped
up
with
pillows
as
she
was
when
i
first
visited
her
but
she
was
flat
on
the
bed
the
truth
is
i
had
so
completely
taken
the
starch
out
of
her
that
she
couldn
t
sit
up
how
do
you
feel
this
morning
miss
tadpoddle
i
inquired
pretending
to
be
interested
about
her
case
oh
i
am
so
weak
doctor
but
for
that
i
would
be
very
well
i
did
not
send
for
you
with
a
view
of
taking
more
medicine
no
no
indeed
i
don
t
think
i
ever
shall
need
any
more
as
long
as
i
live
i
merely
wished
to
speak
with
you
about
miss
bramlett
s
case
i
presume
that
my
brother
has
told
you
of
the
valuable
assistance
i
have
rendered
him
very
well
i
have
something
more
to
say
to
you
on
that
subject
i
fear
you
will
find
that
miss
bramlett
is
a
very
bad
woman
i
confess
i
never
had
much
faith
in
her
at
first
she
was
too
proud
too
made
too
much
display
with
her
money
she
was
parading
the
streets
continually
pretending
to
be
assisting
the
poor
but
evidently
trying
to
create
a
sensation
one
day
i
met
her
at
the
widow
spratt
s
house
and
would
you
believe
it
sir
she
was
dressed
within
an
inch
of
her
life
she
had
on
a
blue
silk
dress
with
real
lace
trimmings
and
by
the
by
that
was
the
identical
dress
she
wore
that
night
when
i
saw
her
go
into
ben
bowles
apartments
through
the
private
entrance
that
opens
from
the
alley
but
i
am
going
too
i
was
telling
you
about
meeting
miss
bramlett
at
widow
spratt
s
well
sir
she
was
sitting
on
a
low
feeding
the
baby
with
condensed
milk
it
was
the
dirtiest
thing
i
ever
laid
eyes
on
and
the
other
five
children
were
cramming
themselves
with
cold
bread
and
turkey
that
miss
bramlett
had
given
them
and
they
were
covered
with
dirty
rags
just
like
the
baby
spratt
is
the
poorest
manager
i
ever
saw
her
children
are
half
naked
and
starved
i
was
really
vexed
at
miss
bramlett
for
throwing
away
her
money
on
such
worthless
people
old
spratt
was
always
drunk
and
wouldn
t
work
he
fell
overboard
from
a
and
was
drowned
it
was
a
great
pity
he
didn
t
die
ten
years
ago
his
children
are
lazy
brats
and
ought
to
starve
miss
bramlett
has
been
supporting
the
whole
family
since
old
spratt
died
spratt
she
lies
in
bed
the
day
pretending
to
be
sick
but
it
is
pure
laziness
and
if
miss
bramlett
would
let
her
alone
she
would
have
to
get
up
and
work
or
starve
well
there
are
many
other
families
in
this
city
depending
on
miss
bramlett
s
money
for
support
it
s
a
scandal
and
a
shame
that
such
laziness
should
be
encouraged
let
em
work
or
starve
is
my
motto
i
asked
spratt
to
subscribe
something
to
our
tramp
reform
association
and
she
wouldn
t
give
a
cent
i
begged
miss
bramlett
to
help
us
and
she
turned
up
her
nose
and
absolutely
sneered
in
my
face
a
hateful
hussy
but
i
ought
not
to
talk
so
because
i
never
bear
malice
against
my
neighbors
it
is
my
character
not
to
nurse
forgive
those
who
trespass
against
us
is
my
motto
this
is
what
our
saviour
taught
us
there
is
lottie
wallingford
who
thinks
the
world
and
all
of
miss
bramlett
i
wonder
how
she
will
feel
when
she
sees
her
friend
hung
for
murder
her
brother
was
engaged
to
be
married
to
miss
bramlett
when
the
murder
was
committed
but
they
say
he
has
run
away
to
california
and
left
his
affianced
bride
here
to
be
hung
while
he
goes
to
get
his
uncle
s
great
fortune
of
course
that
will
make
honors
easy
he
loses
his
sweetheart
but
wins
a
fortune
that
ought
to
console
him
at
any
rate
they
say
you
are
taking
on
about
lottie
wallingford
doctor
she
would
no
doubt
make
you
a
good
wife
if
she
wasn
t
so
much
like
old
rockland
always
talking
about
books
and
she
knows
too
much
i
don
t
like
so
much
genius
i
like
business
it
is
my
character
to
despise
poetry
i
hate
these
dreamy
sentimental
women
who
can
memorize
a
whole
book
and
then
repeat
it
in
public
i
hate
these
silly
women
who
sing
nothing
but
sentimental
songs
they
are
always
talking
about
sweet
flowers
sweet
poetry
sweet
birds
sweet
scenery
sweet
music
everything
is
sweet
with
them
i
hate
sweet
things
it
is
my
character
to
hate
sweet
things
she
and
miss
bramlett
have
converted
the
jail
into
a
picture
gallery
concert
hall
and
book
library
for
my
part
i
don
t
see
how
the
jailer
puts
up
with
such
doings
the
idea
that
a
murderess
in
jail
awaiting
her
trial
should
be
painting
pictures
reading
poetry
and
playing
the
guitar
surpasses
my
comprehension
she
had
better
be
reading
her
bible
or
and
making
preparations
to
meet
her
god
for
she
is
certain
to
be
hung
i
know
enough
myself
to
hang
her
and
i
mean
to
tell
it
i
saw
her
with
my
own
eyes
when
she
went
into
the
apartments
of
that
gambler
at
the
dark
hour
of
night
you
see
i
had
my
suspicions
about
her
anyway
and
when
i
saw
her
meet
bowles
in
the
garden
that
night
i
concluded
that
some
deviltry
was
going
on
and
determined
to
watch
her
i
have
the
advantage
you
see
doctor
over
other
women
it
is
no
trouble
for
me
to
disguise
myself
i
am
very
tall
you
perceive
and
my
brother
s
clothes
fit
me
to
a
i
made
it
my
business
to
waylay
ragland
s
premises
every
night
until
i
succeeded
in
accomplishing
my
object
one
night
about
eight
o
clock
i
saw
miss
bramlett
go
out
of
the
house
by
the
back
way
and
walk
cautiously
toward
the
rear
side
of
the
garden
i
was
concealed
among
the
shrubbery
and
saw
her
coming
directly
toward
the
spot
where
i
was
she
however
turned
to
the
left
passing
within
ten
paces
of
me
she
appeared
to
be
looking
for
some
one
for
she
stopped
near
me
and
waited
for
several
minutes
then
she
turned
square
off
to
the
right
and
entered
the
by
the
back
door
i
think
she
stayed
in
the
about
ten
minutes
at
any
rate
she
remained
in
it
until
i
began
to
grow
restless
and
was
thinking
of
trying
to
slip
around
to
the
front
door
so
as
to
enable
me
to
see
whether
or
not
she
was
alone
i
noticed
that
she
had
her
face
covered
with
a
veil
but
i
knew
her
by
the
dress
and
shawl
she
wore
the
same
she
had
on
the
time
i
met
her
at
the
widow
spratt
s
when
she
came
out
of
the
she
went
in
the
direction
of
the
which
you
know
is
east
of
the
former
and
about
forty
yards
from
it
she
passed
on
without
halting
until
she
reached
the
extreme
back
part
of
the
garden
she
paused
and
looked
around
in
every
direction
as
if
trying
to
ascertain
whether
or
not
any
one
was
watching
her
but
she
did
not
see
me
i
was
too
sharp
to
be
caught
that
way
i
am
not
one
of
those
that
you
have
heard
so
much
about
in
fact
i
hate
women
it
is
my
character
to
hate
em
and
as
to
men
they
ought
not
to
be
permitted
to
live
but
here
i
am
again
straggling
off
from
the
subject
i
beg
you
to
excuse
me
doctor
you
know
i
am
quite
weak
yet
indeed
i
am
it
is
astonishing
to
me
that
i
am
able
to
utter
a
word
your
medicine
cured
my
complaints
it
is
true
but
left
me
completely
prostrated
i
don
t
think
i
ever
shall
need
any
more
drugs
but
i
declare
i
must
quit
wandering
off
that
way
i
wouldn
t
do
it
i
know
but
i
am
afraid
the
strong
medicine
has
to
some
extent
weakened
my
mind
everything
seems
like
a
dream
do
you
ever
dream
doctor
no
ah
then
you
don
t
appreciate
them
where
one
s
dreams
are
pleasant
one
enjoys
the
sensation
very
much
but
when
the
stomach
s
out
of
order
one
is
sure
to
have
unpleasant
dreams
oh
i
had
such
a
nice
dream
last
night
i
thought
that
i
was
but
what
do
you
care
about
my
dreams
i
suppose
you
want
me
to
finish
my
narrative
about
miss
bramlett
s
miss
tadpoddle
said
i
you
must
by
all
means
take
another
dose
of
medicine
the
color
of
your
skin
is
not
as
good
as
it
should
be
and
i
don
t
like
the
looks
of
your
if
i
could
have
induced
her
to
take
another
dose
of
my
drugs
then
she
would
have
remembered
it
to
her
dying
day
no
no
doctor
please
hush
talking
about
your
hateful
drugs
and
let
me
go
on
with
my
story
it
makes
one
feel
so
nervous
to
have
to
wait
and
wait
for
anything
which
ought
to
be
told
without
stopping
there
is
miss
clattermouth
oh
it
would
do
you
good
to
hear
her
relate
a
story
she
can
talk
all
day
and
never
make
a
hobble
you
ought
to
hear
her
deliver
one
of
her
lectures
on
the
rights
of
women
she
is
our
champion
on
that
question
and
you
must
not
fail
to
hear
her
lecture
next
time
she
is
the
business
manager
of
our
tramp
reform
association
and
is
one
of
our
best
financial
agents
you
ought
to
join
our
tramp
reform
association
doctor
we
have
achieved
wonders
in
that
society
we
have
reformed
as
many
as
a
dozen
tramps
during
the
last
in
what
way
did
you
reform
them
miss
tadpoddle
i
inquired
oh
we
furnish
them
board
and
lodgings
for
a
month
by
way
of
trial
and
give
them
a
good
suit
of
clothes
miss
clattermouth
lectures
them
twice
a
week
and
i
give
them
bible
lessons
three
times
a
week
if
at
the
end
of
a
month
one
shows
evidences
of
repentance
and
reformation
we
then
furnish
him
with
another
suit
of
clothes
a
testament
five
dollars
in
cash
and
a
certificate
of
good
behavior
and
discharge
him
with
our
if
he
doesn
t
furnish
the
necessary
evidence
at
the
end
of
the
first
month
what
course
do
you
pursue
then
we
keep
him
another
month
and
if
he
proves
incorrigible
we
dismiss
him
without
our
certificate
or
the
punishment
i
must
say
miss
tadpoddle
is
indeed
very
severe
what
is
to
be
the
fate
of
the
poor
tramp
who
is
thus
turned
loose
on
the
cold
charities
of
the
world
with
no
certificate
and
without
your
blessing
may
i
inquire
what
percentage
prove
incorrigible
and
are
driven
out
without
the
certificate
and
blessing
i
should
say
about
ninety
per
cent
it
is
a
source
of
regret
to
know
that
so
many
prove
unworthy
yet
it
is
a
consolation
to
us
to
save
as
much
as
ten
per
cent
of
the
unfortunate
if
i
understand
you
correctly
any
one
can
secure
two
months
board
and
lodging
by
representing
himself
as
a
oh
no
by
no
means
we
always
appoint
a
committee
to
investigate
each
applicant
and
ascertain
whether
or
not
he
is
really
a
tramp
we
have
to
be
very
strict
in
that
respect
because
we
have
detected
several
of
our
own
citizens
in
the
attempt
to
palm
themselves
off
on
us
as
tramps
you
see
the
rules
of
our
association
don
t
allow
us
to
receive
any
citizen
of
the
state
but
we
only
take
in
those
unfortunate
men
who
are
known
as
tramps
but
enough
about
that
subject
i
must
finish
telling
you
about
miss
bramlett
i
fear
i
shall
fatigue
myself
too
much
anyway
being
so
very
feeble
as
you
are
aware
by
the
by
doctor
do
you
remember
where
i
was
when
we
got
off
of
the
subject
i
believe
you
were
telling
me
about
seeing
miss
bramlett
go
to
the
extreme
back
part
of
the
garden
one
starlight
night
and
that
she
had
on
a
heavy
yes
yes
i
remember
now
i
saw
miss
bramlett
her
movements
were
so
mysterious
that
i
became
very
much
excited
and
curious
to
know
what
she
was
up
to
when
she
got
to
the
back
part
of
the
garden
i
of
course
expected
to
see
her
turn
and
go
back
to
the
house
but
not
so
as
you
shall
hear
as
we
proceed
it
never
had
occurred
to
me
that
she
was
going
to
pay
a
clandestine
visit
at
such
an
hour
as
that
but
you
may
imagine
how
great
was
my
astonishment
when
i
saw
her
removing
the
palings
from
the
fence
my
brother
is
a
most
remarkable
man
he
is
like
me
in
one
respect
he
never
exaggerates
that
is
his
character
he
is
just
like
me
i
hate
exaggeration
well
as
i
was
about
to
observe
what
was
it
i
was
going
to
say
oh
yes
i
remember
now
i
was
on
the
eve
of
telling
you
how
miss
bramlett
s
mysterious
conduct
excited
my
curiosity
curiosity
is
characteristic
of
our
sex
you
know
and
i
confess
to
a
weakness
on
that
score
you
see
i
will
tell
the
truth
though
the
heavens
fall
i
hate
falsehood
it
is
my
character
to
despise
it
honesty
is
the
best
policy
you
remember
the
saying
by
the
by
it
is
an
excellent
motto
but
i
must
be
brief
for
i
begin
to
feel
quite
fatigued
now
one
in
my
feeble
condition
ought
not
to
talk
much
though
when
i
am
strong
and
well
i
don
t
mind
talking
it
does
not
tire
me
at
all
but
it
is
different
with
me
now
just
listen
to
me
now
here
i
am
again
talking
nonsense
instead
of
letting
you
know
what
i
saw
with
my
own
eyes
miss
bramlett
disappeared
through
the
palings
exactly
as
a
ghost
would
have
done
don
t
understand
me
to
say
or
hint
that
i
am
a
believer
in
ghosts
no
i
never
thought
of
such
a
thing
anyway
she
went
through
and
for
a
moment
i
lost
sight
of
her
but
i
was
not
to
be
outdone
in
that
way
i
hastened
to
the
spot
where
i
had
seen
her
last
but
could
see
nothing
of
her
i
lost
no
time
in
leaping
over
the
palings
i
suppose
you
are
astonished
to
hear
me
say
so
but
it
is
no
exaggeration
i
assure
you
very
well
then
i
did
leap
over
the
palings
then
i
was
in
the
street
all
right
you
see
i
am
very
tall
not
much
short
of
six
feet
and
if
i
do
say
it
myself
i
am
very
active
for
a
young
girl
but
let
that
pass
for
i
know
it
does
not
interest
you
miss
bramlett
was
walking
rapidly
down
the
street
when
i
got
over
the
palings
some
fifty
or
sixty
yards
from
me
i
soon
shortened
the
distance
between
us
being
careful
to
avoid
the
faint
light
from
the
lamp
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
the
were
very
far
apart
and
the
streets
were
deserted
the
lamps
appeared
quite
feeble
and
the
light
did
not
interfere
with
my
movements
when
miss
bramlett
reached
the
next
block
she
disappeared
round
the
corner
and
i
was
afraid
she
had
escaped
me
entirely
but
i
hastened
to
the
corner
and
was
delighted
to
see
her
within
twenty
paces
of
me
the
first
alley
she
reached
she
turned
into
and
again
disappeared
but
i
soon
caught
sight
of
her
again
and
kept
close
behind
her
until
she
came
to
the
private
entrance
of
ben
bowles
gambling
hell
she
stood
before
it
a
moment
then
went
in
and
the
door
closed
behind
her
now
doctor
demar
what
do
you
think
of
such
doings
as
that
can
t
you
see
that
she
is
a
very
wicked
woman
it
is
no
use
to
say
that
she
is
innocent
for
i
tell
you
she
is
guilty
and
ought
to
be
hung
all
the
lawyers
in
the
world
can
t
save
her
neck
oh
it
makes
the
cold
chills
run
up
my
back
to
think
of
that
girl
s
wickedness
miss
clattermouth
made
me
promise
not
to
talk
much
and
i
must
keep
my
promise
it
is
my
character
to
keep
my
word
i
despise
people
who
disregard
the
advice
of
friends
miss
clattermouth
has
been
a
true
friend
to
me
indeed
she
has
i
admire
such
friends
did
you
ever
see
the
darling
poodle
she
gave
me
oh
he
is
such
a
sweet
little
fellow
i
must
show
him
to
you
by
all
means
i
think
he
is
asleep
under
the
sofa
there
i
hate
to
disturb
him
though
because
he
always
frets
so
when
his
naps
are
broken
but
i
guess
he
has
got
his
nap
nearly
out
by
this
time
here
tottie
here
tottie
come
along
and
let
the
doctor
see
the
individual
alluded
to
came
crawling
out
from
under
the
sofa
i
suppose
he
would
have
weighed
at
least
eight
ounces
avoirdupois
he
was
covered
with
wool
as
white
as
snow
come
along
darling
don
t
be
bashful
let
the
doctor
see
he
started
toward
the
bed
where
his
mistress
was
but
came
to
a
broom
handle
that
unfortunately
had
been
left
on
the
floor
he
couldn
t
jump
over
it
and
didn
t
have
sense
enough
to
go
round
it
but
he
began
to
scream
with
great
vigor
and
i
had
to
help
him
over
it
i
sat
him
on
the
bed
by
his
mistress
and
i
am
not
ashamed
to
say
that
i
gave
him
such
a
squeeze
that
he
was
unable
to
yell
any
more
for
some
time
oh
doctor
ain
t
he
a
sweet
little
darling
how
could
i
help
loving
miss
clattermouth
when
she
gave
me
such
a
nice
present
but
i
suppose
you
don
t
love
dogs
and
would
prefer
to
hear
what
further
i
have
to
say
about
miss
bramlett
very
well
you
shall
hear
it
i
got
quite
impatient
while
i
was
waiting
to
see
her
come
out
of
bowles
den
but
i
made
up
my
mind
to
see
the
end
of
it
and
when
i
make
up
my
mind
to
do
anything
it
is
as
good
as
done
i
never
give
up
an
undertaking
once
i
resolve
to
go
into
it
it
is
my
character
never
to
back
down
i
hate
people
who
undertake
anything
and
don
t
do
it
i
am
one
of
those
sort
that
don
t
do
things
by
halves
i
cling
on
like
a
badger
i
believe
that
is
the
name
of
the
little
animal
that
has
such
a
reputation
for
hanging
on
with
so
much
tenacity
anyway
i
am
that
kind
of
a
woman
the
weather
was
quite
cold
that
night
and
i
suffered
very
much
from
it
but
i
didn
t
mind
that
at
all
i
think
i
should
have
stood
my
ground
if
it
had
rained
lumps
of
ice
as
big
as
my
head
well
as
i
was
about
to
observe
i
suffered
from
the
cold
weather
but
i
was
rewarded
at
last
for
i
saw
miss
bramlett
come
out
of
the
house
by
the
same
door
through
which
she
had
entered
though
she
was
not
alone
this
time
bowles
was
with
her
i
can
not
state
exactly
how
long
she
had
remained
inside
of
the
house
but
if
i
was
on
my
oath
in
a
i
should
say
it
was
not
a
minute
less
than
three
hours
when
she
came
out
of
the
house
she
was
leaning
on
bowles
arm
and
they
were
conversing
in
an
i
could
not
hear
all
that
was
said
because
i
was
compelled
to
remain
some
distance
from
them
so
as
to
keep
them
from
seeing
me
but
i
heard
enough
heaven
knows
to
hang
miss
bramlett
as
high
as
haman
i
don
t
exactly
remember
how
high
it
was
that
haman
was
hung
though
it
was
about
fifty
cubits
now
that
must
have
been
a
pretty
lofty
gallows
a
cubit
is
either
eighteen
inches
or
eighteen
feet
i
don
t
remember
which
i
like
that
way
of
executing
criminals
hang
em
high
so
everybody
can
see
em
i
hope
viola
bramlett
will
be
hung
where
we
can
all
see
the
fun
but
i
was
about
to
tell
you
what
she
said
to
bowles
she
was
leaning
on
his
arm
with
her
mouth
close
to
his
ear
you
know
bowles
of
course
yes
i
am
glad
you
do
he
is
such
a
nice
gentleman
so
handsome
dresses
so
exquisite
then
he
is
so
liberal
with
his
money
he
aids
us
in
all
our
benevolent
enterprises
oh
he
is
such
a
darling
clever
gentleman
what
a
pity
it
is
that
such
a
handsome
gentleman
should
be
led
astray
by
that
scheming
hypocrite
viola
bramlett
it
is
very
clear
that
she
had
him
completely
under
her
thumb
and
i
am
afraid
he
has
been
duped
by
her
beauty
and
her
hypocritical
smiles
i
heard
her
calling
him
my
dear
darling
ben
at
least
half
a
dozen
times
just
think
of
that
will
you
i
declare
it
makes
me
sick
to
think
of
it
she
was
evidently
talking
to
him
about
the
murder
of
her
brother
for
i
heard
her
ask
bowles
if
he
thought
there
was
any
danger
of
detection
i
also
heard
her
ask
him
if
a
doctor
could
tell
when
any
one
had
died
from
poison
and
how
much
strychnine
it
would
take
to
produce
death
oh
doctor
it
made
the
blood
freeze
in
my
veins
to
hear
her
discussing
the
murder
of
her
brother
but
mind
you
i
had
no
idea
then
that
she
intended
to
murder
her
own
brother
i
followed
her
and
bowles
back
to
ragland
s
residence
they
halted
at
the
end
of
the
garden
and
talked
for
a
long
time
in
an
at
last
bowles
took
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
then
she
went
into
the
house
while
he
retraced
his
steps
to
his
i
immediately
returned
home
and
jotted
down
in
my
diary
the
things
i
had
seen
just
as
i
have
related
them
to
you
now
how
can
the
lawyers
keep
that
wicked
woman
from
hanging
i
should
like
you
to
tell
me
if
you
you
may
imagine
what
my
feelings
were
when
miss
tadpoddle
had
finished
her
remarkable
story
but
i
shall
not
try
to
describe
them
that
viola
bramlett
was
lost
beyond
all
question
seemed
to
be
a
fixed
fact
and
that
it
would
nearly
kill
lottie
i
knew
full
well
i
tried
to
argue
miss
bramlett
s
case
to
myself
so
as
to
bring
her
out
unstained
but
the
proof
rose
like
huge
olympus
before
me
everything
seemed
to
point
unmistakably
to
her
as
the
guilty
party
and
if
she
was
guilty
at
all
it
was
clear
that
she
had
sunk
so
far
down
in
the
pit
of
infamy
as
to
render
it
necessary
for
me
to
separate
her
and
lottie
chapter
xx
time
was
gliding
on
unusually
slow
it
always
does
when
we
want
it
to
go
fast
and
never
fails
to
gallop
when
we
want
it
to
walk
a
fortnight
had
stolen
by
since
my
last
interview
with
the
interesting
miss
tadpoddle
dabbs
and
tadpoddle
were
still
working
like
beavers
but
accomplishing
nothing
that
anybody
wanted
them
to
do
everything
they
did
seemed
to
add
new
links
to
the
strong
chain
of
evidence
against
miss
bramlett
public
sentiment
which
at
first
had
been
strong
in
favor
of
her
innocence
had
undergone
a
radical
change
and
was
now
as
strong
against
her
as
it
had
been
in
her
favor
i
hate
public
sentiment
i
detest
it
for
it
is
a
heartless
tyrant
anyway
as
often
wrong
as
right
and
always
on
extremes
miss
tadpoddle
and
miss
clattermouth
were
to
a
great
extent
responsible
for
the
sudden
change
in
public
sentiment
their
busy
tongues
had
never
been
idle
for
a
moment
i
declare
said
miss
clattermouth
the
meanest
thing
miss
bramlett
did
was
to
attempt
to
involve
bowles
in
her
scheme
of
murder
he
is
a
thoughtless
jolly
young
man
unsuspicious
by
nature
and
the
very
kind
of
a
man
to
be
deceived
by
such
a
hussy
as
viola
indeed
observed
miss
tadpoddle
i
agree
with
you
there
he
is
one
of
those
confiding
unsuspicious
sort
of
men
easily
played
on
by
such
an
adventuress
my
brother
was
inclined
to
censure
him
but
you
know
the
simplicity
of
the
good
soul
he
does
not
draw
the
proper
distinctions
in
such
cases
he
is
one
of
the
best
officers
in
the
secret
service
but
he
owes
most
of
his
success
to
my
judgment
i
often
make
the
rounds
with
him
and
as
to
miss
bramlett
s
case
i
think
i
may
say
without
exaggeration
for
i
never
exaggerate
that
but
for
my
valuable
aid
he
never
would
have
secured
the
proof
necessary
to
convict
her
and
then
he
was
inclined
to
think
that
bowles
was
as
much
to
blame
as
miss
bramlett
but
i
defended
bowles
i
thought
it
was
my
duty
to
do
it
i
convinced
him
that
it
was
his
duty
to
let
bowles
alone
the
truth
is
he
was
about
to
have
him
arrested
but
i
made
him
consent
to
use
bowles
as
a
witness
against
miss
bramlett
as
i
thought
his
evidence
would
be
indispensable
on
the
oh
i
am
so
delighted
to
hear
it
replied
miss
clattermouth
do
you
know
jemima
that
i
think
you
are
the
dearest
creature
on
earth
how
could
we
manage
our
affairs
without
you
bowles
is
a
dear
good
fellow
a
little
wild
i
admit
but
all
young
men
you
know
must
sow
their
crop
of
wild
oats
i
mean
to
tell
him
how
you
have
been
serving
him
he
comes
to
see
me
quite
often
and
he
should
know
what
a
good
friend
he
has
in
you
i
am
sure
he
will
make
a
liberal
donation
to
our
tramp
reform
association
as
soon
as
he
is
advised
of
your
friendly
intercession
in
his
behalf
he
handles
lots
of
money
and
we
must
get
him
to
take
an
interest
in
our
yes
i
dare
say
he
will
make
us
a
liberal
donation
if
you
will
explain
the
case
to
him
if
viola
bramlett
was
fool
enough
to
give
her
money
to
him
that
s
no
reason
why
we
should
not
have
a
share
of
it
we
will
get
the
inns
on
bowles
and
if
we
are
wise
we
will
make
good
use
of
our
advantage
but
i
shall
depend
on
your
cleverness
to
manage
the
money
matter
by
the
way
what
do
you
think
of
charlotte
wallingford
she
is
very
pretty
and
possesses
good
talent
but
is
ruining
her
character
by
her
friendship
for
viola
bramlett
she
has
no
right
to
thrust
herself
among
respectable
people
after
staying
in
jail
with
that
unnatural
and
cruel
murderess
she
pretends
to
think
that
miss
bramlett
is
innocent
and
for
my
part
she
is
welcome
to
her
opinion
if
it
will
do
her
any
good
though
she
will
get
a
lofty
fall
when
the
trial
comes
off
i
am
told
that
they
have
made
a
concert
room
of
the
jail
and
are
continually
thumping
away
on
an
old
guitar
and
singing
sentimental
songs
i
hate
such
romantic
pretty
anyway
and
i
know
it
would
make
me
sick
to
witness
their
but
speaking
of
lottie
wallingford
i
don
t
think
she
ever
will
marry
ed
demar
he
thinks
she
loves
him
but
it
is
my
opinion
that
she
is
merely
playing
with
him
i
can
t
believe
she
loves
anybody
but
herself
she
likes
to
be
different
from
other
women
that
is
the
reason
she
sticks
to
viola
bramlett
it
is
because
everybody
else
has
forsaken
her
she
imagines
it
will
create
quite
a
sensation
she
likes
to
make
herself
conspicuous
talks
with
lawyers
and
politicians
makes
a
display
of
learning
holds
herself
above
our
tramp
reform
association
quotes
poetry
plays
the
guitar
and
sings
lovesick
songs
oh
i
despise
such
women
it
is
my
character
to
hate
em
no
no
she
ain
t
going
to
marry
ed
demar
he
is
too
sober
and
practical
to
fill
her
bill
she
will
set
her
cap
for
a
poet
or
a
politician
or
some
such
worthless
trash
demar
knows
viola
bramlett
is
guilty
and
would
leave
her
to
her
fate
but
for
charlotte
wallingford
he
has
been
tied
to
her
apron
string
as
for
her
i
expect
if
the
whole
truth
were
known
she
is
no
better
than
viola
for
me
to
tell
all
the
tales
of
slimy
slander
that
were
put
in
circulation
by
miss
tadpoddle
and
her
friends
would
occupy
too
much
time
and
would
bore
my
audience
suffice
it
to
say
that
lottie
s
spotless
name
came
out
unscathed
it
was
impossible
to
keep
her
in
ignorance
of
the
reports
that
were
being
circulated
by
those
malicious
old
hags
though
i
had
done
my
best
to
do
it
they
always
managed
somehow
to
let
the
parties
slandered
know
of
the
fact
at
any
rate
such
was
the
case
in
this
instance
but
to
my
utter
astonishment
lottie
seemed
to
be
unmoved
by
it
no
evidence
of
anger
or
annoyance
was
exhibited
by
her
and
she
smiled
derisively
remarking
that
if
it
afforded
miss
tadpoddle
pleasure
to
wag
her
tongue
she
had
no
objections
to
urge
against
it
one
bright
sunny
evening
when
the
atmosphere
was
soft
and
invigorating
i
think
it
was
about
three
weeks
after
harry
had
started
for
california
i
was
strolling
alone
in
doctor
dodson
s
flower
garden
busily
occupied
in
castle
building
i
did
not
like
the
state
of
affairs
and
i
wanted
to
steal
away
and
be
alone
so
as
to
sum
up
things
and
see
if
i
could
make
a
sure
guess
as
to
the
future
the
painful
situation
in
which
lottie
was
placed
was
a
source
of
great
uneasiness
to
me
and
i
began
to
think
it
was
my
duty
to
extricate
her
if
possible
i
had
mentioned
the
subject
to
rockland
and
he
promised
to
endeavor
to
persuade
lottie
to
cease
her
sojourn
at
the
jail
for
he
agreed
with
me
that
the
proof
fixed
viola
s
guilt
beyond
question
but
when
he
mentioned
the
subject
to
lottie
she
peremptorily
refused
to
abandon
miss
bramlett
vowing
that
she
was
innocent
and
that
she
never
would
forsake
her
i
had
another
interview
with
dabbs
and
tadpoddle
who
had
discovered
a
new
batch
of
evidence
that
appeared
to
settle
the
question
as
to
viola
s
guilt
so
completely
that
it
was
useless
to
make
any
further
fight
in
her
behalf
the
truth
is
i
had
lost
all
hopes
at
last
and
the
main
question
to
be
considered
now
was
how
to
get
lottie
away
from
the
jail
i
was
well
aware
of
the
fact
that
i
was
treading
on
dangerous
ground
when
i
ventured
to
talk
to
her
about
viola
s
guilt
i
took
a
seat
on
a
low
wooden
bench
in
the
arbor
and
gave
the
rein
to
my
thoughts
they
strayed
back
to
my
boyhood
days
when
i
was
tramping
along
the
road
with
lottie
by
my
side
then
they
dashed
off
to
california
and
endeavored
to
interview
harry
my
fancy
next
snatched
up
lottie
s
lovely
image
and
placed
it
before
me
then
my
heart
grew
light
i
tried
to
fasten
my
thoughts
on
that
dear
image
but
couldn
t
do
it
for
in
spite
of
me
they
would
wander
off
to
unpleasant
subjects
a
dozen
little
birds
gave
me
a
serenade
with
their
delightful
melody
as
they
perched
among
the
vines
over
the
top
of
the
arbor
and
i
tried
to
induce
my
mind
to
interview
the
sweet
little
songsters
but
it
refused
the
fact
was
my
thoughts
seemed
bent
on
mischief
that
is
to
say
they
appeared
to
be
determined
to
make
me
miserable
because
instead
of
dwelling
on
lottie
and
the
birds
they
went
off
after
miss
tadpoddle
and
miss
clattermouth
and
came
lugging
them
back
to
my
arbor
i
began
to
watch
the
sun
as
it
was
going
down
among
the
trees
on
the
arkansas
side
of
the
river
looking
like
a
huge
ball
of
fire
and
my
thoughts
must
have
gone
down
with
the
sun
for
i
stretched
myself
out
on
the
bench
and
soon
was
sound
asleep
i
dreamed
that
i
was
in
heaven
and
that
a
beautiful
angel
who
had
been
there
long
before
my
arrival
met
me
at
the
outer
gate
and
announced
herself
as
the
guide
who
had
been
sent
out
to
escort
me
in
and
to
show
me
the
charming
beauties
of
the
place
she
conducted
me
along
the
main
street
for
some
distance
where
solid
blocks
of
gold
constituted
the
pavement
then
she
led
me
through
a
beautiful
landscape
thickly
studded
with
green
trees
whose
foliage
gave
forth
the
most
delicious
perfume
after
wandering
through
those
delightful
groves
for
some
time
she
brought
me
to
the
banks
of
a
beautiful
river
whose
bosom
was
covered
with
little
boats
gliding
over
the
smooth
surface
of
the
water
each
boat
contained
a
band
of
angels
who
were
singing
hymns
of
praise
to
the
great
king
of
heaven
my
guide
conducted
me
to
a
lovely
spot
near
the
banks
of
the
beautiful
river
and
instructed
me
to
take
a
seat
on
a
bench
of
gold
that
was
furnished
with
cushions
of
exquisite
pattern
the
spot
was
covered
with
flowers
whose
perfume
filled
all
the
air
with
a
sweet
scent
my
guide
then
informed
me
that
there
was
an
angel
in
heaven
who
had
been
watching
and
waiting
for
me
a
long
while
that
she
had
been
besieging
the
great
throne
with
her
prayers
in
my
behalf
and
she
told
me
to
keep
my
seat
and
wait
a
short
time
and
she
would
inform
the
angel
of
my
arrival
she
then
spread
out
her
golden
wings
and
flew
to
the
northern
part
of
heaven
then
as
soon
as
she
disappeared
i
was
seized
with
a
drowsy
feeling
and
i
lay
down
on
the
soft
cushions
and
soon
was
asleep
after
a
while
i
thought
that
the
flowers
overhead
began
to
fall
gently
down
on
me
i
felt
them
softly
touching
my
cheek
my
guide
returned
accompanied
by
another
angel
oh
she
was
the
most
charming
creature
that
i
had
ever
seen
her
beautiful
form
was
robed
in
spotless
white
with
long
waves
of
golden
hair
flowing
unconfined
about
her
shoulders
her
large
blue
eyes
gazed
down
on
me
while
tears
of
joy
trembled
in
them
i
thought
she
touched
my
cheek
with
the
beautiful
feathers
at
the
tip
of
her
wing
i
shouted
for
joy
and
woke
myself
and
lottie
was
standing
over
me
tickling
my
nose
with
her
handkerchief
there
stood
the
angel
exactly
as
i
had
seen
her
in
heaven
only
she
was
dressed
in
blue
silk
instead
of
white
and
minus
the
wings
get
up
old
sluggard
she
said
you
have
slept
long
enough
i
have
been
waiting
over
an
hour
for
you
to
wake
but
i
think
you
would
have
slept
here
all
night
if
i
had
not
tickled
your
nose
with
my
oh
lottie
i
have
had
such
a
delicious
dream
i
have
been
in
heaven
i
can
not
realize
the
fact
that
i
am
on
earth
you
were
there
too
you
were
an
angel
with
wings
so
white
and
beautiful
i
hope
your
dream
will
come
true
when
old
time
shall
settle
accounts
with
so
do
i
and
i
think
my
dream
is
a
good
omen
sit
down
and
let
me
take
a
good
look
at
you
you
appear
so
fresh
and
beautiful
this
i
notice
that
you
have
not
forsaken
your
old
inclinations
to
flatter
no
it
is
no
flattery
i
assure
you
pardon
me
but
i
must
be
permitted
to
give
expression
to
my
happiness
in
some
way
else
i
could
not
endure
she
took
a
seat
by
my
side
while
her
beautiful
eyes
looked
up
into
my
face
a
joyful
tear
trembled
on
the
long
lashes
how
is
it
darling
i
at
last
inquired
as
i
pressed
her
hand
to
my
lips
that
you
are
looking
so
fresh
and
bright
when
you
have
been
constantly
in
attendance
at
the
jail
i
was
afraid
it
would
make
you
the
performance
of
a
duty
always
gives
me
health
and
happiness
no
matter
how
much
the
labor
how
is
miss
bramlett
she
is
quite
well
physically
but
in
great
mental
i
suppose
that
is
caused
by
the
discovery
of
the
new
batch
of
evidence
that
was
lately
made
against
what
are
you
talking
about
don
t
you
know
that
she
is
grieving
herself
to
death
about
harry
indeed
no
and
i
can
not
understand
why
she
should
think
of
him
after
having
driven
him
from
her
that
only
goes
to
show
how
little
you
know
about
a
woman
s
heart
viola
bramlett
is
not
thinking
of
her
own
situation
but
her
mind
is
all
the
time
on
don
t
you
think
it
is
high
time
she
was
worried
a
little
about
her
own
condition
the
date
is
near
at
hand
when
the
grand
jury
will
assemble
and
it
is
certain
that
they
will
find
a
bill
then
she
will
be
compelled
to
stand
her
indeed
i
am
glad
to
know
that
the
day
is
near
at
hand
when
we
shall
get
rid
of
this
do
you
think
miss
bramlett
will
be
ready
for
the
trial
when
the
time
arrives
oh
yes
i
see
no
reason
why
she
should
not
everything
has
been
arranged
except
what
i
was
telling
you
about
helen
herndon
and
that
i
shall
intrust
to
do
you
think
it
worth
while
to
send
me
to
vicksburg
on
a
wild
goose
chase
don
t
talk
that
way
you
must
go
at
once
i
have
got
some
information
about
her
but
not
quite
all
i
want
you
will
find
helen
herndon
s
mother
lives
near
the
city
of
vicksburg
and
you
must
go
there
for
the
information
which
i
i
ll
go
anywhere
or
do
anything
to
please
you
but
don
t
give
me
anything
to
do
that
will
keep
me
away
very
oh
no
i
could
not
do
that
but
you
can
soon
get
back
and
then
we
are
ready
for
the
are
you
as
hopeful
now
lottie
as
to
the
result
of
the
trial
as
you
were
at
first
to
be
candid
with
you
i
must
confess
that
i
am
not
that
philadelphia
detective
has
managed
to
excite
public
sentiment
against
viola
it
was
very
unfortunate
that
harry
should
have
employed
him
he
may
be
a
good
officer
but
he
had
his
mind
satisfied
that
viola
was
guilty
and
he
could
not
divest
himself
of
it
he
was
so
blinded
by
his
prejudice
that
he
could
not
see
any
evidence
except
such
as
would
operate
against
her
some
people
in
this
city
will
be
greatly
surprised
when
the
trial
comes
off
things
will
come
to
light
that
will
startle
some
who
are
now
dreaming
in
fancied
does
miss
bramlett
know
about
this
late
discovery
of
evidence
that
was
made
by
dabbs
she
knows
nothing
about
anything
of
a
disagreeable
nature
that
my
prudence
could
keep
from
her
i
did
my
best
to
stop
all
those
floating
rumors
from
reaching
her
ears
but
in
spite
of
all
my
efforts
miss
tadpoddle
and
miss
clattermouth
will
occasionally
come
to
the
jail
and
spout
venom
worse
than
that
snake
which
bit
me
on
the
wrist
but
it
was
very
gratifying
to
me
to
see
that
viola
treated
it
with
scorn
she
would
be
happy
if
she
were
reconciled
with
lottie
when
i
was
in
heaven
a
while
ago
i
did
not
see
any
angels
that
in
any
respect
resembled
miss
tadpoddle
though
my
guide
did
not
take
me
to
the
gossiping
stop
eddie
don
t
use
levity
now
please
the
occasion
demands
serious
thought
let
miss
tadpoddle
and
her
friend
miss
clattermouth
enjoy
their
tattling
proclivities
they
are
more
to
be
pitied
than
condemned
the
truth
is
i
am
really
sorry
for
them
because
they
never
knew
the
pleasures
of
true
love
no
one
ever
gazed
down
on
either
of
those
poor
old
maids
with
such
a
look
of
love
as
is
now
bent
on
me
we
should
let
the
mantle
of
charity
conceal
their
faults
and
look
more
closely
after
our
own
for
my
part
i
am
sincerely
sorry
for
people
who
have
none
to
love
them
what
a
lonely
unhappy
existence
must
theirs
be
lottie
i
do
honestly
believe
you
have
the
best
heart
that
ever
throbbed
in
woman
s
you
never
were
more
mistaken
in
all
your
life
because
i
have
no
heart
at
all
a
naughty
old
thief
slipped
in
and
stole
it
was
only
a
swap
and
you
got
the
worst
of
the
bargain
but
such
as
it
is
it
belongs
to
you
no
one
can
dispute
your
title
but
really
i
would
give
anything
for
your
charitable
disposition
i
don
t
think
i
ever
heard
you
speak
ill
of
any
as
to
that
i
have
endeavored
to
do
to
others
as
i
would
have
them
do
to
me
i
think
it
is
a
good
rule
not
to
speak
at
all
about
our
neighbors
unless
we
can
say
something
in
their
favor
we
all
have
faults
and
we
are
not
so
apt
to
discover
our
own
as
we
are
to
detect
those
of
others
miss
clattermouth
and
her
friend
miss
tadpoddle
really
believe
that
viola
is
a
murderess
they
think
that
they
are
discharging
nothing
more
than
a
plain
duty
when
they
try
to
convince
other
people
that
it
is
true
but
let
us
change
the
subject
we
must
discuss
our
plans
for
the
future
when
can
you
start
for
vicksburg
morning
if
you
wish
it
you
are
my
now
and
you
will
find
me
always
thank
you
make
it
let
me
understand
exactly
what
i
am
going
a
few
miles
from
the
city
of
vicksburg
you
will
find
a
widow
lady
residing
on
a
farm
her
name
is
fanny
totten
this
lady
had
a
daughter
named
victoria
who
eloped
with
a
man
of
disreputable
character
many
years
ago
now
you
must
find
out
the
name
of
the
man
with
whom
she
eloped
and
get
some
one
who
was
acquainted
with
victoria
totten
to
come
to
memphis
to
testify
to
her
identity
you
must
take
plenty
of
funds
with
you
to
defray
all
expenses
i
want
you
if
possible
to
secure
one
of
her
pictures
and
bring
it
to
me
also
procure
some
of
her
manuscript
anything
which
will
enable
an
expert
to
identify
her
handwriting
you
will
have
to
be
very
cautious
or
you
will
arouse
the
suspicion
of
miss
totten
s
friends
this
woman
has
been
traveling
under
various
names
and
you
must
commence
at
her
mother
s
house
and
trace
her
to
every
place
where
she
has
been
since
she
left
her
mother
s
roof
i
don
t
think
you
will
find
any
difficulty
in
that
respect
for
she
has
not
covered
up
her
tracks
quite
as
well
as
she
might
have
is
she
the
one
you
think
committed
the
murder
ask
me
no
questions
and
i
ll
tell
you
no
falsehoods
do
what
i
bid
you
and
wait
for
the
lottie
you
are
a
real
lawyer
and
i
hope
you
will
clear
your
client
but
the
evidence
against
viola
rises
higher
and
higher
every
day
and
it
will
be
an
i
dare
say
you
are
right
in
regard
to
the
part
but
as
to
my
being
a
lawyer
i
make
no
pretensions
in
that
line
i
merely
wish
to
serve
my
friend
but
let
that
pass
and
tell
me
what
is
this
new
evidence
which
you
say
has
been
have
you
not
heard
it
not
from
a
source
entitled
to
much
credit
i
want
to
hear
it
from
another
witness
a
respectable
gentleman
will
swear
that
he
met
miss
bramlett
at
ben
bowles
private
apartment
late
at
night
about
ten
days
before
her
brother
was
the
man
who
swears
that
will
commit
perjury
and
shall
be
punished
for
i
must
be
permitted
to
remind
you
that
miss
tadpoddle
will
also
swear
that
viola
was
i
never
shall
believe
she
will
swear
it
until
i
hear
her
do
it
with
my
own
she
told
me
she
would
and
you
may
depend
on
her
doing
it
and
the
worst
of
it
is
she
will
swear
that
she
heard
miss
bramlett
ask
bowles
how
much
strychnine
it
would
take
to
produce
death
oh
lottie
what
will
be
your
fate
if
viola
should
be
found
guilty
it
makes
me
tremble
to
think
of
the
awful
consequences
of
such
an
unfortunate
event
it
would
ruin
all
of
eddie
don
t
be
alarmed
remember
the
old
adage
sufficient
unto
the
day
is
the
evil
it
will
be
time
enough
to
lament
the
catastrophe
when
it
true
enough
but
i
should
like
to
see
the
man
who
never
dreaded
approaching
you
must
learn
a
little
more
philosophy
master
a
little
more
patience
and
don
t
give
credit
to
all
you
hear
but
come
you
must
take
me
back
to
the
jail
i
promised
viola
i
would
return
before
nine
and
she
would
be
disappointed
if
i
i
escorted
her
to
the
jail
and
took
my
leave
to
return
home
and
spend
the
night
in
sweet
dreams
about
lottie
what
she
could
want
with
the
private
history
of
miss
totten
was
a
question
that
puzzled
me
who
was
miss
totten
who
was
assisting
lottie
in
secret
was
another
problem
i
could
not
solve
it
was
evident
to
my
mind
that
she
was
working
in
conjunction
with
some
one
behind
the
scenes
i
was
inclined
to
be
angry
because
i
had
not
been
told
everything
why
should
they
not
confide
in
me
wasn
t
i
as
anxious
to
see
miss
bramlett
s
innocence
established
as
any
one
could
be
before
i
reached
home
i
had
worked
myself
into
a
towering
passion
and
had
resolved
to
demand
an
explanation
as
soon
as
i
should
return
from
vicksburg
doctor
dodson
met
me
at
the
front
hall
door
and
i
knew
as
soon
as
my
eyes
met
his
that
he
had
something
to
say
to
me
of
importance
ah
ha
here
we
come
my
boy
glad
to
see
you
walk
in
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
my
boy
trouble
brewing
ah
ha
real
trouble
ahead
something
must
be
done
no
time
to
swap
horses
now
my
boy
lottie
s
reputation
is
in
danger
she
must
be
saved
no
work
now
that
dear
girl
is
infatuated
with
miss
bramlett
she
must
leave
the
jail
at
once
else
she
is
a
ruined
woman
see
to
it
my
boy
you
are
the
man
to
do
it
don
t
you
see
ah
ha
you
are
the
one
to
take
her
away
from
the
jail
all
sorts
of
scandalous
tales
afloat
about
miss
bramlett
investigation
says
they
are
too
true
society
will
condemn
lottie
her
name
has
already
been
mentioned
unfavorably
ah
ha
my
boy
somebody
will
be
killed
before
this
business
is
show
me
the
villain
who
has
dared
breathe
a
word
of
suspicion
on
the
fair
name
of
my
lottie
hush
hush
my
boy
that
s
not
the
way
to
talk
let
us
take
the
proper
steps
to
save
her
she
must
not
be
permitted
to
associate
with
miss
bramlett
another
day
i
can
t
see
what
rockland
means
by
allowing
her
to
stay
in
jail
with
that
unfortunate
mr
rockland
has
done
his
best
to
induce
lottie
to
return
home
but
she
positively
refused
to
do
it
i
have
been
pleading
with
her
also
but
it
does
no
good
she
vows
never
to
forsake
viola
until
she
gets
out
of
the
pshaw
ed
it
is
nonsense
to
talk
about
getting
miss
bramlett
out
of
the
scrape
she
has
fallen
into
a
pit
of
infamy
so
deep
that
no
power
on
earth
can
lift
her
out
of
it
ah
ha
don
t
you
see
it
my
boy
she
has
not
only
committed
a
most
cruel
murder
but
she
has
been
guilty
of
other
detestable
crimes
which
i
would
blush
to
name
while
i
pity
the
poor
girl
i
am
unwilling
to
see
lottie
ruined
by
a
foolish
friendship
for
her
society
will
not
draw
the
proper
distinctions
in
such
cases
at
first
i
did
not
believe
miss
bramlett
guilty
but
after
full
investigation
i
was
forced
to
change
my
opinion
all
the
lawyers
in
memphis
can
not
clear
her
ragland
is
very
much
to
blame
for
this
state
of
affairs
he
has
not
done
his
duty
as
guardian
to
his
brother
s
daughter
ah
ha
my
boy
don
t
you
see
the
fact
of
the
business
is
ragland
is
no
account
drinks
and
gambles
all
the
time
instead
of
looking
after
his
business
i
can
t
understand
what
induced
bramlett
to
name
ragland
as
the
guardian
of
his
children
anyway
i
suppose
he
was
ignorant
of
his
bad
habits
ragland
is
worse
than
her
husband
thinks
of
nothing
but
self
dresses
like
an
empress
and
spends
her
time
at
theatres
balls
and
on
the
streets
instead
of
looking
after
her
household
affairs
how
could
anything
be
expected
of
miss
bramlett
when
left
as
she
was
a
young
giddy
girl
in
the
hands
of
such
people
as
ragland
and
his
wife
that
s
the
reason
i
pity
the
poor
girl
more
than
i
condemn
her
i
mean
to
petition
the
governor
to
pardon
her
he
will
do
it
without
hesitation
he
was
here
the
other
day
and
was
introduced
to
lottie
i
heard
him
say
she
was
the
most
charming
woman
he
ever
had
met
he
was
delighted
with
her
music
and
says
she
possesses
the
brightest
mind
of
any
woman
he
ever
saw
the
governor
is
a
great
friend
of
rockland
and
we
shall
have
no
difficulty
in
procuring
a
pardon
for
miss
bramlett
ah
ha
eddie
my
boy
don
t
you
see
poor
thing
she
must
be
pardoned
no
use
to
try
to
clear
her
by
a
jury
proof
too
strong
you
might
as
well
try
to
storm
gibraltar
with
as
to
get
an
acquittal
in
court
but
above
all
other
considerations
we
must
separate
lottie
from
miss
i
don
t
believe
it
can
be
done
was
my
reply
i
think
lottie
never
will
leave
viola
while
she
is
in
prison
but
if
you
will
accompany
me
to
the
jail
early
in
the
morning
we
will
try
what
can
be
done
i
am
going
to
start
for
vicksburg
on
the
train
and
if
we
see
lottie
it
must
be
all
right
my
boy
we
will
see
her
in
the
morning
she
must
come
away
from
that
jail
but
see
if
you
can
t
stir
up
a
sensible
dream
that
will
show
you
how
to
manage
lottie
in
the
we
were
at
the
jail
by
seven
o
clock
on
the
following
morning
for
the
purpose
of
trying
to
induce
lottie
to
go
back
to
her
home
doctor
dodson
stated
the
object
of
our
visit
at
the
same
time
telling
lottie
how
her
reputation
was
being
injured
by
her
association
with
miss
bramlett
i
saw
her
fair
cheeks
turn
as
red
as
blood
and
knew
she
was
angry
though
no
one
would
have
thought
so
from
her
language
she
cast
an
appealing
glance
at
me
i
could
read
her
thoughts
as
plain
as
print
doctor
dodson
said
lottie
as
she
laid
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
looked
up
into
his
face
would
it
be
charitable
would
it
be
christian
duty
to
forsake
a
friend
merely
because
that
friend
had
been
forsaken
by
the
world
it
seems
to
me
that
that
would
be
the
very
time
when
a
true
friend
would
stick
closer
now
my
dear
doctor
you
know
how
much
i
respect
you
you
are
well
aware
of
the
fact
that
no
one
has
a
higher
regard
for
your
opinions
than
i
have
nay
you
know
how
much
eddie
and
i
love
you
it
would
make
me
miserable
indeed
if
i
were
to
incur
your
displeasure
i
believe
that
when
you
have
looked
at
both
sides
of
the
case
with
an
impartial
eye
you
ll
not
be
angry
with
me
for
refusing
to
forsake
my
unfortunate
friend
in
this
dark
hour
of
her
troubles
you
say
that
my
reputation
has
already
suffered
injury
by
my
association
with
viola
bramlett
i
regret
very
much
to
hear
it
i
am
sorry
indeed
that
my
reputation
is
so
feeble
as
to
be
crippled
by
such
puny
assaults
i
have
been
flattering
myself
with
the
idea
that
an
honest
woman
s
reputation
could
withstand
all
such
assaults
and
come
out
unscathed
but
if
it
is
true
that
my
character
has
been
damaged
by
my
friendship
for
miss
bramlett
it
would
not
repair
the
damage
for
me
to
forsake
her
now
i
must
be
permitted
to
have
my
own
way
in
this
matter
and
at
no

i
started
to
vicksburg
at
and
was
absent
from
home
a
little
over
three
weeks
i
however
succeeded
in
securing
all
the
information
that
lottie
wanted
though
i
had
to
make
a
trip
to
new
orleans
before
i
found
it
chapter
xxi
there
is
nothing
i
detest
more
than
i
do
a
mystery
of
any
sort
notwithstanding
my
abhorrence
of
it
i
now
found
myself
by
some
unaccountable
cause
entangled
in
a
most
singular
and
inexplicable
web
of
mystery
the
more
i
struggled
to
extricate
myself
from
it
the
lower
down
did
i
plunge
until
despite
my
efforts
i
found
myself
inundated
and
helpless
one
evening
after
i
had
performed
a
very
hard
day
s
work
at
the
i
hurried
home
to
seek
that
rest
which
the
excessive
labor
of
the
day
caused
me
to
need
it
was
some
time
after
dark
when
i
lifted
the
latch
of
the
gate
which
stood
in
front
of
doctor
dodson
s
handsome
residence
and
began
to
walk
leisurely
along
the
gravel
road
leading
toward
the
house
the
night
was
unusually
dark
the
sky
being
totally
obscured
by
innumerable
black
angry
clouds
while
ever
and
anon
the
sound
of
distant
thunder
announced
the
approaching
storm
and
an
occasional
flash
of
lightning
would
every
now
and
then
cast
a
bright
light
around
me
i
halted
a
few
paces
from
the
gate
leaned
against
one
of
the
tall
poplar
trees
that
stood
near
the
edge
of
the
road
and
took
off
my
hat
to
let
the
cool
fresh
breeze
fan
my
fevered
brow
my
head
was
aching
severely
my
cheeks
were
hot
and
the
blood
in
my
veins
seemed
to
be
boiling
i
concluded
that
a
few
moments
spent
in
the
open
air
would
relieve
me
soon
after
i
had
halted
i
thought
i
heard
the
sound
of
footsteps
approaching
the
spot
where
i
stood
i
knew
it
was
not
doctor
dodson
for
he
had
left
town
early
in
the
morning
to
visit
a
patient
in
the
country
informing
me
that
he
would
not
be
home
until
next
day
i
became
convinced
that
the
grounds
had
been
invaded
by
some
one
perhaps
a
thief
who
was
waiting
for
an
opportunity
to
rob
the
house
i
tried
to
peer
through
the
darkness
hoping
to
see
the
intruder
but
i
was
straining
my
eyes
in
vain
for
i
could
not
distinguish
any
object
at
a
distance
of
ten
feet
except
when
the
space
was
momentarily
lighted
up
by
the
flashes
of
electricity
that
often
blazed
among
the
clouds
sometimes
i
would
imagine
that
i
had
been
deceived
but
my
doubts
were
finally
set
at
rest
when
i
distinctly
saw
the
form
of
a
man
as
he
dodged
behind
a
tree
just
as
a
bright
streak
of
lightning
blazed
for
a
second
about
me
who
are
you
and
what
do
you
want
here
at
this
late
hour
i
demanded
in
a
loud
tone
fly
for
your
life
ed
your
is
discovered
you
have
no
time
to
spare
the
officers
are
after
you
large
rewards
have
been
offered
for
your
capture
dead
or
alive
get
away
as
soon
as
you
can
those
words
were
uttered
in
a
suppressed
tone
while
the
speaker
still
remained
concealed
behind
the
tree
only
exposing
his
head
to
my
view
which
i
could
plainly
see
every
time
the
lightning
would
flash
who
are
you
hush
ed
for
heaven
s
sake
don
t
talk
so
loud
else
we
will
be
discovered
for
i
saw
the
detective
tracking
you
last
night
they
will
hang
you
if
they
catch
you
fly
immediately
or
it
will
be
too
late
think
of
your
pretty
darling
and
for
her
sake
escape
while
you
leave
these
premises
this
instant
you
drunken
vagabond
i
angrily
exclaimed
else
i
will
call
a
policeman
and
have
you
sent
to
the
hush
i
tell
you
ed
this
is
no
time
to
crack
jokes
it
is
a
question
of
life
or
death
and
if
you
are
determined
to
throw
away
your
life
you
can
not
say
that
i
failed
to
do
my
duty
i
have
given
you
fair
warning
you
need
not
be
afraid
to
trust
me
for
i
would
die
for
you
if
necessary
you
may
depend
on
me
to
fetch
your
darling
to
you
in
any
part
of
the
i
at
last
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
i
was
in
the
presence
of
an
escaped
lunatic
and
that
it
would
be
good
policy
to
keep
at
a
respectful
distance
from
him
an
unusually
bright
flash
of
lightning
now
played
for
several
seconds
among
a
heavy
bank
of
dark
clouds
that
were
hanging
very
low
overhead
spreading
a
brilliant
light
over
the
space
around
me
which
enabled
me
to
get
a
plain
view
of
the
features
of
this
mysterious
intruder
the
face
was
that
of
a
young
man
rather
pale
but
very
handsome
and
i
could
see
that
he
was
well
dressed
in
a
suit
of
black
cloth
and
in
the
bright
light
i
noticed
a
heavy
watch
chain
glittering
on
his
vest
again
i
inquired
of
the
man
his
name
and
as
it
was
the
third
time
i
had
made
the
same
demand
i
accompanied
the
inquiry
with
a
threat
that
i
would
instantly
call
a
policeman
if
he
refused
to
give
me
a
definite
answer
ed
are
you
crazy
exclaimed
the
strange
intruder
you
know
well
enough
who
i
am
i
have
encountered
serious
risk
in
making
my
way
here
in
order
to
warn
you
of
the
approaching
danger
fly
else
you
are
lost
beyond
why
should
i
fly
who
seeks
my
life
i
have
injured
nobody
if
you
know
of
any
reason
why
i
should
leave
my
home
say
so
in
plain
ed
exclaimed
the
stranger
as
he
moved
toward
the
gate
my
conscience
is
clear
for
i
have
faithfully
discharged
my
duty
though
i
may
lose
my
life
by
the
act
they
told
me
you
were
half
mad
but
i
am
now
satisfied
you
are
completely
so
remember
my
warning
ere
it
is
too
by
the
time
he
had
uttered
the
last
word
he
passed
through
the
gate
and
i
could
distinctly
hear
the
heels
of
his
boots
striking
on
the
brick
pavement
as
he
hurried
down
the
street
i
called
to
him
to
stop
and
give
an
explanation
whether
he
heard
me
or
not
i
do
not
know
for
he
did
not
answer
or
halt
i
sank
down
on
the
turf
buried
my
face
in
my
hands
and
endeavored
to
call
to
mind
all
the
events
that
had
transpired
around
me
during
that
past
week
what
have
i
done
to
offend
any
one
was
the
first
question
i
propounded
to
myself
is
it
possible
that
i
have
unwittingly
injured
any
person
have
i
at
any
time
been
deprived
of
my
reason
have
i
been
insane
and
while
in
that
condition
committed
some
enormous
crime
i
remained
seated
on
the
turf
at
least
an
hour
and
perhaps
would
have
stayed
longer
but
i
was
aroused
from
my
reverie
by
the
heavy
drops
of
rain
that
began
to
fall
on
my
head
i
then
rose
and
went
to
the
house
when
i
was
met
at
the
front
door
by
my
adopted
mother
who
had
been
watching
for
me
a
long
time
come
into
my
room
edward
she
said
as
she
took
hold
of
my
arm
and
pressed
her
lips
on
my
cheek
we
will
take
tea
there
it
is
ready
and
we
have
been
waiting
for
you
over
an
i
knew
by
the
tone
of
her
voice
that
something
serious
was
weighing
on
her
mind
and
i
could
tell
by
the
inquiring
glance
which
she
frequently
cast
on
me
that
she
wanted
to
have
a
talk
with
me
she
rang
the
bell
and
when
the
servant
came
to
answer
it
she
ordered
tea
to
be
served
in
her
room
which
she
always
did
when
she
had
any
important
communications
to
make
to
me
i
noticed
that
she
kept
her
large
expressive
gray
eyes
intently
fixed
on
me
with
a
strange
look
of
inquiry
notwithstanding
the
facility
with
which
i
had
been
able
to
divine
her
thoughts
at
all
times
i
was
greatly
puzzled
as
well
as
embarrassed
on
that
occasion
by
the
strangeness
of
her
look
i
took
a
stand
in
front
of
a
large
mirror
that
hung
on
the
wall
in
order
to
see
if
there
was
anything
unusual
in
my
personal
appearance
that
caused
my
mother
to
stare
at
me
so
strangely
while
i
was
looking
in
the
mirror
i
noticed
that
my
mother
still
had
her
eyes
riveted
on
me
and
that
she
had
her
hands
firmly
clasped
above
her
head
which
she
always
did
when
in
trouble
as
soon
as
i
turned
round
she
suddenly
dropped
her
hands
took
a
seat
at
the
little
table
and
commenced
pouring
out
my
tea
and
i
could
see
that
her
hand
trembled
so
that
she
could
not
hold
the
cup
she
filled
the
cup
as
it
sat
on
the
table
and
when
she
attempted
to
pass
it
to
me
she
let
it
fall
on
the
floor
breaking
it
into
fragments
edward
she
whispered
in
a
tone
tremulous
from
emotion
you
will
have
to
pour
out
the
tea
yourself
for
my
nerves
are
somewhat
unstrung
this
i
proceeded
to
help
myself
in
silence
being
so
much
embarrassed
by
my
mother
s
strange
conduct
that
i
was
afraid
to
venture
to
make
a
remark
supper
over
the
servants
cleared
the
table
and
my
mother
took
her
seat
in
a
large
cushioned
and
in
order
to
conceal
my
excitement
i
sat
down
on
a
low
seat
and
rested
my
head
in
her
lap
i
never
before
had
been
so
long
in
her
presence
without
speaking
and
the
silence
was
becoming
oppressive
and
painful
when
my
head
fell
on
her
lap
she
began
to
smooth
back
my
hair
with
her
hand
and
i
felt
a
tear
drop
on
my
cheek
that
had
fallen
from
her
eye
what
is
it
mother
what
has
occurred
to
distress
you
so
edward
have
you
ever
committed
any
crime
that
would
subject
you
to
the
penalties
of
the
law
if
a
powder
magazine
had
exploded
beneath
my
feet
and
tossed
me
onto
the
top
of
a
house
across
the
street
it
could
not
have
given
me
a
greater
shock
than
that
question
did
oh
edward
my
dear
son
tell
me
what
has
happened
what
have
you
done
to
cause
a
reward
to
be
offered
for
your
arrest
i
beseech
you
to
tell
me
everything
and
then
i
will
know
how
to
advise
you
mother
am
i
in
my
proper
senses
or
am
i
mad
give
me
a
direct
answer
to
those
don
t
trifle
with
your
mother
that
way
my
son
i
implore
you
to
remember
that
this
is
no
occasion
for
i
never
was
in
deeper
earnest
than
i
am
now
mother
therefore
i
repeat
my
question
have
i
gone
crazy
or
not
have
you
noticed
anything
in
my
conduct
or
in
my
appearance
that
would
indicate
the
loss
of
reason
have
i
ever
been
a
somnambulist
did
you
ever
know
of
my
leaving
the
premises
after
going
to
bed
have
i
ever
been
subject
to
fits
of
insanity
or
fits
of
any
sort
now
mother
dear
i
earnestly
request
you
to
answer
each
and
all
of
those
questions
because
my
mind
is
greatly
troubled
about
edward
i
am
afraid
that
you
are
not
very
well
for
i
am
sure
you
never
talked
so
strangely
before
it
is
hard
for
me
to
believe
that
you
could
seriously
propound
such
absurd
questions
to
me
but
to
gratify
you
i
will
give
you
a
candid
reply
to
every
one
of
those
foolish
questions
i
unhesitatingly
answer
no
and
i
will
go
further
and
say
that
i
do
not
believe
the
state
of
tennessee
contains
a
man
who
possesses
a
mind
more
evenly
balanced
than
very
well
my
dear
mother
tell
me
why
you
asked
me
such
a
strange
question
just
before
dark
i
was
walking
through
the
flower
garden
inspecting
some
work
that
i
had
ordered
the
gardener
to
do
and
when
i
reached
the
extreme
back
part
near
the
fence
i
saw
a
strange
woman
on
the
outside
who
was
beckoning
to
me
she
was
elegantly
dressed
and
heavily
veiled
so
i
did
not
get
a
chance
to
see
her
face
i
was
considerably
frightened
at
first
because
the
singularity
of
her
conduct
led
me
to
believe
that
she
was
crazy
and
i
started
toward
the
house
when
she
called
my
name
in
a
voice
i
thought
i
had
heard
before
i
then
stopped
and
hesitated
for
a
moment
when
she
said
she
had
an
important
communication
to
make
which
involved
the
life
of
some
one
who
was
very
dear
to
me
i
drew
near
the
spot
where
she
stood
when
she
made
the
following
statement
tell
edward
that
his
place
of
concealment
has
been
discovered
a
large
reward
having
been
offered
for
his
capture
and
that
the
law
officers
are
after
him
when
you
deliver
this
message
to
edward
he
will
understand
it
and
you
may
tell
him
that
his
darling
shall
be
cared
for
and
conveyed
to
him
as
soon
as
he
reaches
a
place
of
she
then
abruptly
left
me
before
i
had
time
to
ask
her
name
in
fact
i
was
so
completely
shocked
by
the
statement
she
had
made
that
i
did
not
utter
a
word
now
edward
my
dear
son
tell
me
what
it
all
my
darling
mother
as
god
is
my
judge
i
declare
that
it
is
as
much
of
a
mystery
to
me
as
it
is
to
you
but
of
one
thing
you
may
rest
assured
i
never
have
knowingly
committed
a
crime
of
any
sort
that
would
cause
me
to
conceal
myself
anywhere
i
believe
that
a
combination
has
been
formed
against
me
by
some
secret
enemies
the
object
of
which
is
to
estrange
lottie
from
me
and
to
secure
her
for
heartsell
i
do
not
think
they
ever
will
be
able
to
shake
lottie
s
confidence
in
me
but
there
is
danger
of
their
winning
rockland
to
their
side
no
mother
dear
you
never
shall
have
cause
to
blush
on
account
of
any
conduct
of
mine
god
bless
my
noble
boy
she
exclaimed
as
she
again
pressed
me
to
her
bosom
i
believe
you
and
if
you
will
trust
him
who
guides
the
storm
he
will
carry
you
through
this
trouble
i
did
not
tell
my
mother
about
the
strange
interview
i
had
with
the
mysterious
man
on
the
lawn
as
i
did
not
want
to
increase
her
troubles
i
remained
with
her
until
eleven
o
clock
then
went
to
my
sleeping
room
where
i
was
surprised
to
find
a
letter
lying
on
my
dressing
table
i
seized
the
envelope
and
with
a
trembling
hand
tore
it
open
and
read
as
follows
dear
ed
fly
for
your
life
you
are
discovered
a
large
reward
is
offered
for
your
capture
delay
is
fatal
yours
truly
i
had
scarcely
finished
reading
the
letter
when
a
little
negro
boy
a
servant
belonging
to
the
household
came
in
and
handed
me
a
note
here
boss
he
exclaimed
as
he
shoved
the
paper
in
my
face

as
the
little
negro
left

room
i
proceeded
to
open
the
letter
and
lo
and
behold
here
was
another
document
exactly
like
the
one
that
i
had
found
on
my
table
except
the
handwriting
the
last
one
being
a
very
neat
fine
hand
while
the
first
one
was
written
in
a
bold
uneven
hand
fly
for
your
life
you
are
discovered
a
large
reward
is
offered
for
your
capture
delay
is
this
letter
had
no
name
signed
to
it
and
no
date
it
was
written
on
and
richly
perfumed
my
hands
trembled
so
violently
that
i
could
scarcely
hold
the
letter
still
enough
to
read
it
and
when
i
did
manage
to
peruse
it
my
vexation
surpassed
all
previous
bounds
and
i
fell
back
on
the
sofa
and
groaned
in
despair
i
remained
thus
buried
deep
in
my
melancholy
reflections
until
after
midnight
then
went
to
bed
but
not
to
sleep
the
old
clock
on
the
mantel
was
ticking
regularly
and
at
every
stroke
of
the
pendulum
it
seemed
to
say
fly
for
your
life
fly
for
your
life
it
must
have
been
near
daylight
when
i
fell
into
a
troubled
slumber
from
which
i
was
awakened
by
the
breakfast
bell
at
eight
o
clock
my
temples
were
throbbing
my
eyes
felt
like
balls
of
fire
while
my
blood
was
feverish
i
plunged
into
a
large
tank
of
cold
water
in
the
which
served
to
cool
the
fever
in
my
blood
hastily
arranging
my
toilet
i
met
my
mother
at
the
breakfast
table
with
a
cheerful
smile
which
cost
me
a
considerable
effort
to
keep
up
she
made
many
anxious
inquiries
about
my
health
and
the
manner
in
which
i
had
rested
during
the
night
all
of
which
i
answered
truthfully
as
far
as
i
could
without
increasing
her
anxiety
i
took
a
cup
of
strong
coffee
kissed
my
mother
and
hurried
to
the
when
a
little
boy
came
briskly
in
and
handed
me
another
letter
and
darted
out
at
the
door
before
i
had
time
to
interrogate
him
as
to
who
had
sent
it
i
of
course
supposed
it
was
another
one
of
those
detestable
notes
advising
me
to
fly
for
life
and
being
disgusted
with
documents
of
that
sort
i
moved
toward
the
fire
intending
to
consign
the
letter
to
the
flames
unopened
but
glancing
at
the
superscription
i
was
delighted
to
discover
that
it
was
from
lottie
the
contents
of
the
note
caused
a
thrill
of
delicious
joy
to
dart
through
my
heart
it
was
like
a
cold
bubbling
spring
gushing
up
in
the
middle
of
an
african
desert
before
a
perishing
traveler
dear
edward
this
is
to
inform
you
that
i
am
going
to
spend
the
day
in
my
flower
garden
for
the
purpose
of
superintending
the
transplanting
of
some
of
my
flowers
and
if
it
will
not
interfere
with
your
professional
duties
i
should
be
delighted
to
have
the
benefit
of
your
advice
and
assistance
mother
and
dodson
have
very
kindly
consented
to
spend
the
day
with
viola
which
enables
me
to
look
after
my
flowers
they
you
know
have
been
sadly
neglected
of
late
when
i
arrived
i
found
lottie
busily
engaged
in
arranging
a
fresh
bed
where
she
was
preparing
to
plant
some
i
am
so
glad
you
have
come
edward
she
exclaimed
as
she
came
to
meet
me
you
may
make
up
your
mind
to
do
a
good
day
s
work
here
just
see
how
the
weeds
are
choking
my
pretty
jasmines
yonder
and
there
are
my
geraniums
all
dying
for
lack
of
attention
i
declare
it
is
too
bad
and
i
must
give
uncle
zack
a
good
scolding
for
neglecting
my
notwithstanding
her
declarations
about
the
lack
of
attention
which
her
garden
had
been
subjected
to
i
was
filled
with
delicious
pleasure
at
the
beautiful
prospect
before
me
the
air
was
loaded
with
ravishing
odors
arising
from
different
kinds
of
fragrant
flowers
a
new
fountain
with
a
bronze
statue
of
diana
standing
in
the
center
had
been
lately
put
up
near
the
the
goddess
held
her
bow
and
arrow
in
her
hand
while
a
jet
of
sparkling
water
came
gushing
out
from
the
end
of
the
arrow
and
fell
into
a
large
marble
basin
at
her
feet
a
marble
cupid
stood
on
the
south
side
of
the
basin
holding
a
gilded
dart
pointed
toward
a
statue
of
venus
as
she
appears
rising
up
out
of
the
water
innumerable
green
turfy
walks
meandered
about
among
the
charming
flowers
while
hundreds
of
beautiful
vases
in
china
and
gold
red
blue
and
green
lined
each
side
filled
with
all
kinds
of
plants
i
was
so
completely
intoxicated
by
the
charming
sweetness
with
which
the
murmuring
breeze
was
impregnated
by
fragrant
flowers
that
i
could
scarcely
keep
from
giving
expression
to
my
delightful
feelings
in
shouts
of
joy
as
i
stood
gazing
intently
at
lottie
as
she
moved
about
among
the
flowers
like
a
beautiful
fairy
i
lifted
up
my
soul
in
humble
thanks
to
god
for
giving
me
the
heart
of
such
a
noble
woman
why
do
you
stand
there
all
the
day
idle
eddie
when
there
is
so
much
work
to
do
why
do
you
not
come
and
help
me
transplant
these
flowers
those
questions
had
the
effect
of
rousing
me
from
my
delightful
reverie
and
i
went
to
work
in
good
earnest
and
did
not
stop
until
the
perspiration
began
to
stream
from
my
brow
there
now
edward
the
job
is
complete
and
we
will
rest
under
the
shade
of
the
magnolias
i
am
going
to
give
you
a
nice
picnic
dinner
to
compensate
you
for
assisting
then
addressing
uncle
zack
she
said
tell
burley
to
prepare
a
good
dinner
for
two
and
that
we
will
dine
in
the
magnolia
grove
send
us
a
small
table
here
and
tell
her
to
be
in
a
hurry
for
industrious
people
are
always
hungry
now
edward
here
is
a
nice
seat
for
you
and
here
is
one
for
me
now
we
will
rest
from
our
labors
and
have
a
cozy
chat
about
old
times
unless
you
have
got
something
new
to
talk
then
for
the
first
time
since
my
arrival
at
the
garden
the
memory
of
the
mysterious
warnings
i
had
received
rose
up
like
banquo
s
ghost
before
me
what
is
the
matter
with
you
edward
are
you
not
well
i
declare
your
face
is
very
pale
i
must
have
exerted
myself
a
little
too
much
while
working
among
the
flowers
i
guess
a
little
rest
in
this
delightful
shade
will
soon
effect
a
see
here
edward
she
exclaimed
as
she
fixed
her
beautiful
eyes
on
me
you
are
attempting
to
do
that
which
you
ought
to
know
you
can
not
how
is
that
you
are
endeavoring
to
deceive
me
which
it
is
high
time
you
were
learning
you
can
not
do
if
you
do
not
immediately
proceed
to
inform
me
what
has
happened
to
distress
you
i
shall
at
once
conclude
that
your
professions
of
love
for
me
are
nothing
more
than
sounding
brass
and
tinkling
cymbals
i
knew
as
soon
as
i
laid
my
eyes
on
you
this
morning
that
your
mind
was
disturbed
about
something
and
then
i
must
remind
you
of
the
fact
that
i
am
a
and
if
you
refuse
to
disgorge
i
shall
at
once
make
a
revelation
that
will
startle
i
began
to
dodge
the
question
by
an
attempt
to
change
the
subject
but
she
gently
placed
her
hand
over
my
mouth
not
another
word
shall
you
utter
until
you
make
up
your
mind
to
tell
me
the
whole
truth
i
have
a
presentiment
that
our
bright
sky
is
about
to
be
obscured
by
lowering
clouds
an
invisible
influence
has
been
working
on
my
mind
whispering
ominous
tales
of
approaching
misfortunes
our
smooth
sea
is
soon
to
be
ruffled
and
it
is
high
time
for
us
to
set
about
trimming
our
sails
so
as
to
be
ready
for
the
storm
which
i
fear
is
soon
to
burst
upon
i
proceeded
to
give
her
a
minute
history
of
the
mysterious
communications
which
had
so
disturbed
and
annoyed
me
i
noticed
that
the
charming
color
of
the
rose
that
beautified
her
cheeks
gradually
disappeared
as
i
imparted
the
mysterious
news
to
her
and
her
hand
slightly
trembled
as
she
attempted
to
arrange
a
bouquet
from
a
quantity
of
flowers
which
she
had
gathered
now
lottie
what
do
you
think
it
all
means
i
will
answer
you
in
real
yankee
fashion
do
you
know
of
any
person
who
bears
malice
or
toward
you
have
you
had
any
misunderstanding
or
quarrel
with
any
man
lately
have
you
had
any
legal
entanglements
which
could
cause
any
one
to
dislike
you
then
it
is
a
joke
that
some
mischievous
person
is
endeavoring
to
practice
on
you
in
order
to
have
a
laugh
among
his
friends
at
your
expense
let
us
put
our
trust
in
god
and
pray
to
him
for
help
and
all
will
be
well
let
us
remember
the
instructions
given
by
our
great
redeemer
in
regard
to
prayer
he
said
when
thou
prayest
enter
into
thy
closet
and
when
thou
hast
shut
thy
door
pray
to
thy
father
which
is
in
secret
and
thy
father
which
seeth
in
secret
shall
reward
thee
now
edward
i
have
faith
in
that
precious
promise
and
if
we
will
pray
earnestly
in
secret
we
will
come
out
unscathed
in
the
end
will
you
do
it
yes
i
promise
you
i
will
heaven
being
my
very
good
then
let
our
unknown
adversaries
do
their
worst
we
will
triumph
at
lottie
you
are
a
real
philosopher
and
i
would
give
any
consideration
to
be
like
perhaps
i
am
but
i
see
our
dinner
coming
now
and
if
you
have
no
objections
we
will
pay
our
respects
to
it
for
i
am
very
hungry
take
your
seat
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
and
help
me
to
a
plate
of
lottie
i
have
a
serious
question
to
ask
you
and
i
want
you
to
reflect
well
and
then
give
me
a
candid
answer
for
something
tells
me
that
some
great
misfortune
is
going
to
overtake
let
me
help
your
plate
to
a
slice
of
this
venison
it
looks
very
tempting
there
now
be
so
good
as
to
pass
the
salad
over
this
way
what
were
you
about
to
say
just
now
i
could
plainly
see
that
she
was
making
an
effort
to
conceal
her
dreadful
apprehensions
by
keeping
up
a
conversation
about
one
thing
while
her
thoughts
were
on
another
i
was
about
to
propound
a
very
serious
question
to
you
but
i
guess
i
had
better
wait
until
you
finish
your
dinner
as
it
is
very
plain
that
i
shall
not
have
your
attention
please
hand
me
the
oysters
and
then
go
ahead
with
your
question
and
mind
you
do
not
turn
it
into
a
philosophical
lottie
have
you
unlimited
confidence
in
my
honor
are
you
fond
of
stewed
squirrel
try
some
of
it
i
think
it
is
very
nice
as
to
confidence
i
would
swear
by
you
if
it
were
not
sinful
you
know
the
good
book
forbids
us
to
swear
by
anything
hold
your
goblet
over
here
and
let
me
give
you
some
milk
i
think
your
honor
is
won
t
you
have
a
piece
of
chicken
as
to
your
integrity
it
is
good
middling
any
other
questions
you
wish
to
ask
see
here
lottie
this
may
be
the
last
dinner
that
you
and
i
ever
will
eat
together
in
fact
i
am
afraid
that
it
will
and
we
must
have
a
serious
talk
before
we
the
goblet
which
she
attempted
to
hand
to
me
fell
on
the
table
and
broke
into
fragments
there
now
edward
see
what
i
have
done
and
you
are
responsible
for
it
because
you
have
frightened
me
with
your
evil
i
am
truly
sorry
that
i
have
been
so
unfortunate
as
to
disturb
your
equanimity
but
we
had
better
discuss
this
matter
now
i
am
impressed
with
the
belief
that
a
scheme
is
on
foot
originated
and
worked
by
some
unknown
enemy
of
mine
the
object
of
which
is
to
create
a
breach
between
you
and
me
if
therefore
you
hear
any
evil
reports
about
me
i
want
you
to
make
a
solemn
promise
that
you
will
grant
me
an
opportunity
to
put
in
my
defense
before
you
venture
to
condemn
edward
i
have
a
notion
to
give
you
a
downright
good
scolding
do
you
think
any
earthly
power
could
shake
my
confidence
in
you
i
would
sooner
distrust
thank
you
lottie
and
if
ever
i
give
you
just
cause
to
withdraw
your
confidence
from
me
may
providence
forsake
me
heaven
disown
me
and
the
world
despise
me
i
have
no
apprehensions
on
that
score
i
think
i
am
acquainted
with
the
nobility
of
your
soul
at
all
events
i
am
not
afraid
to
risk
my
destiny
on
the
accuracy
of
my
lottie
if
it
is
sinful
to
worship
any
mortal
being
then
i
plead
guilty
but
while
i
worship
you
it
has
a
tendency
to
increase
my
thankfulness
to
edward
love
me
as
much
as
you
please
but
do
not
forget
your
obligations
to
the
great
creator
honor
and
love
him
above
all
things
there
is
no
real
happiness
on
earth
save
that
which
is
sanctioned
and
purified
through
god
s
holy
will
but
come
we
have
rested
long
enough
let
us
go
to
work
else
we
will
not
have
time
to
finish
before
lottie
kept
me
very
busy
until
the
sun
went
down
and
then
taking
me
by
the
arm
she
led
me
to
a
rustic
bench
in
the
magnolia
grove
now
sir
you
may
sit
down
and
rest
while
i
arrange
this
bouquet
for
you
i
think
you
have
done
a
very
good
day
s
yes
and
i
demand
my
wages
in
the
first
place
here
is
a
beautiful
lock
of
golden
hair
that
has
strayed
off
from
its
companions
and
as
it
looks
so
lonesome
wandering
about
by
itself
i
shall
take
the
liberty
to
cut
it
off
and
put
it
my
take
it
if
you
wish
and
as
many
more
as
you
want
but
how
are
you
going
to
cut
it
i
clipped
off
the
pretty
straggler
with
my
and
hid
it
in
my
bosom
then
held
her
to
my
heart
for
a
moment
and
hurried
home
with
a
soul
surcharged
with
indescribable
just
as
ingomar
finished
the
sentence
one
of
the
seedy
men
walked
forward
confronting
the
queen
bowed
very
low
and
taking
from
his
breast
pocket
a
large
paper
with
a
huge
red
seal
and
a
blue
ribbon
attached
to
it
gave
a
grunt
and
a
slight
cough
and
addressed
her
as
follows
i
humbly
crave
your
majesty
s
pardon
as
i
fear
that
i
shall
be
so
unfortunate
as
to
interfere
with
your
amusements
the
fact
is
madame
i
am
under
the
necessity
of
performing
an
unpleasant
duty
but
it
must
be
discharged
we
officers
of
the
law
are
very
frequently
called
upon
to
perform
services
in
the
name
of
the
state
of
an
unpleasant
nature
we
have
postponed
this
matter
as
long
as
the
character
of
the
case
will
justify
myself
and
peniwinkle
are
peace
officers
regularly
commissioned
we
have
the
honor
to
hold
in
our
possession
a
proclamation
or
more
properly
speaking
a
requisition
from
the
governor
of
mississippi
on
the
governor
of
tennessee
demanding
the
delivery
to
us
of
the
body
of
one
escaped
murderer
our
papers
as
you
may
see
are
all
properly
authenticated
as
the
law
directs
his
excellency
the
governor
of
tennessee
has
issued
his
warrant
and
we
here
offer
to
show
then
turning
to
ingomar
who
appeared
perfectly
composed
he
said
mr
ingomar
or
demar
or
whoever
you
are
we
arrest
you
in
the
name
of
the
state
of
mississippi
under
a
warrant
we
have
here
now
you
will
consider
yourself
as
our
then
taking
a
pair
of
handcuffs
from
his
pocket
he
made
a
move
as
if
to
fasten
them
on
ingomar
s
wrists
look
to
the
queen
cried
scottie
she
is
falling
ingomar
caught
her
in
time
to
prevent
the
fall
and
carried
her
down
to
her
he
then
returned
to
the
deck
where
the
officers
were
and
addressed
them
now
sir
i
am
ready
to
settle
this
little
matter
with
you
in
the
first
place
you
will
oblige
me
by
tossing
those
handcuffs
into
the
river
and
you
had
better
be
quick
about
it
else
i
shall
put
you
in
along
with
the
officer
was
a
very
small
man
ingomar
looked
like
a
huge
colossus
as
his
tall
handsome
person
towered
above
the
little
officer
who
began
to
tremble
with
fear
as
he
cast
an
imploring
look
up
into
his
face
my
dear
sir
began
the
officer
in
a
tremulous
voice
you
don
t
mean
to
defy
the
law
i
hope
we
are
nothing
but
humble
representatives
of
the
law
modestly
attempting
to
discharge
a
simple
will
you
throw
those
handcuffs
into
the
river
or
would
you
prefer
to
go
in
yourself
i
give
you
two
seconds
to
the
little
man
threw
the
irons
into
the
river
instantly
now
sir
said
ingomar
you
may
consider
me
your
prisoner
if
you
wish
it
and
i
will
accompany
you
anywhere
you
may
want
me
to
go
but
if
you
have
any
more
irons
about
you
i
advise
you
to
send
them
after
the
others
without
peniwinkle
then
took
another
pair
of
handcuffs
from
his
pocket
and
tossed
them
overboard
now
gentlemen
you
may
take
seats
here
if
you
like
and
listen
to
the
remainder
of
a
little
story
which
i
have
been
relating
for
the
amusement
of
my
friends
i
can
finish
it
by
the
time
we
reach
vicksburg
then
i
will
be
pleased
to
go
with
you
to
jackson
mississippi
to
answer
any
demands
which
the
law
may
require
of
then
turning
to
ivanhoe
he
said
be
so
kind
as
to
go
down
and
escort
the
queen
up
and
inform
her
that
her
friends
are
anxiously
awaiting
her
presence
so
that
our
amusements
may
be
ivanhoe
returned
in
a
few
moments
with
the
queen
leaning
on
his
arm
she
was
weeping
bitterly
and
it
was
plain
to
see
that
the
shock
had
considerably
shaken
her
nerves
ivanhoe
handed
her
to
a
seat
when
ingomar
said
i
am
exceedingly
sorry
that
your
majesty
should
have
been
disturbed
by
what
has
just
occurred
but
i
beg
to
assure
you
that
there
is
no
cause
for
alarm
on
the
part
of
my
good
friends
whatever
this
affair
for
which
i
am
now
under
arrest
is
by
no
means
new
to
me
and
i
don
t
feel
in
the
least
annoyed
by
it
the
only
cause
of
regret
is
that
your
majesty
should
have
been
troubled
by
it
but
it
need
not
interrupt
the
thread
of
my
little
story
which
i
am
now
ready
to
take
up
as
soon
as
you
may
signify
your
the
queen
was
so
much
distressed
by
the
occurrence
just
related
that
she
was
unable
to
utter
a
word
tears
were
still
falling
rapidly
from
her
eyes
while
her
hand
trembled
as
she
made
a
sign
to
ingomar
to
proceed
chapter
xxii
the
arrest
of
ingomar
had
the
effect
to
cast
a
gloom
over
the
entire
party
who
were
beginning
to
feel
deeply
interested
in
his
history
all
were
seated
in
a
circle
round
the
queen
waiting
in
silence
to
hear
what
was
to
be
said
next
the
queen
was
making
a
desperate
effort
to
conceal
her
emotions
but
without
effect
the
two
officers
sat
staring
at
each
other
evidently
very
much
embarrassed
while
ingomar
was
the
only
one
who
appeared
calm
and
unconcerned
the
mysterious
lady
in
the
black
domino
was
leaning
on
the
arm
of
the
old
gentleman
with
the
long
white
beard
she
seemed
to
be
anxiously
watching
the
two
officers
and
ingomar
while
she
stood
near
the
corner
of
the
pilot
house
about
thirty
feet
from
where
the
queen
and
her
party
were
seated
the
strange
conduct
of
the
lady
in
the
black
domino
had
excited
the
curiosity
of
every
passenger
on
the
boat
and
when
ingomar
was
arrested
under
a
charge
of
willful
murder
it
was
hard
to
tell
which
feeling
had
the
upper
hand
curiosity
or
indignation
if
ingomar
had
intimated
a
wish
to
have
the
two
officers
put
ashore
in
a
canebrake
it
would
have
been
done
in
fact
ivanhoe
made
a
proposition
to
that
effect
but
ingomar
wouldn
t
hear
to
it
no
my
friends
it
is
my
wish
that
these
two
officers
should
be
treated
with
the
utmost
courtesy
they
are
only
executing
the
process
which
the
law
has
placed
in
their
hands
but
i
would
beg
to
admonish
them
that
handcuffs
are
not
made
for
gentlemen
the
law
considers
all
men
innocent
until
their
guilt
is
established
and
as
i
have
already
stated
this
case
is
by
no
means
unfamiliar
to
me
it
is
really
a
part
of
the
little
story
which
i
have
been
telling
and
i
promise
to
tell
you
all
about
it
before
i
am
done
i
guess
i
can
easily
conclude
the
narrative
by
the
time
we
shall
reach
vicksburg
but
i
must
relate
circumstances
and
incidents
in
the
order
in
which
they
introduced
themselves
into
my
story
about
three
weeks
after
i
had
departed
from
vicksburg
where
i
had
gone
as
i
have
heretofore
stated
to
hunt
up
certain
facts
which
lottie
thought
were
necessary
the
grand
jury
returned
into
the
criminal
court
a
true
bill
against
viola
bramlett
charging
her
with
willful
murder
and
the
day
for
the
trial
was
agreed
on
rockland
had
made
the
necessary
arrangements
with
the
who
was
quite
a
young
man
but
possessed
a
high
order
of
intellect
he
was
a
good
lawyer
but
differed
from
other
prosecuting
attorneys
in
one
respect
nearly
all
state
attorneys
imagine
that
it
is
their
duty
to
prosecute
with
a
vengeance
every
unfortunate
creature
against
whom
a
bill
may
be
found
but
quillet
was
ever
ready
to
enter
a
when
the
proof
justified
it
i
was
overwhelmed
with
astonishment
one
morning
to
see
harry
wallingford
come
walking
into
my
office
looking
like
a
corpse
his
beard
was
long
and
uneven
the
hair
on
his
head
tangled
and
unsightly
his
clothes
were
soiled
and
hung
loosely
about
his
body
and
his
face
had
no
signs
of
blood
in
it
his
eyes
were
sunk
deep
in
their
sockets
and
had
a
wild
restless
stare
about
them
he
held
out
his
thin
bony
hand
as
he
dropped
into
a
chair
like
one
who
was
very
tired
what
on
earth
caused
you
to
return
so
soon
harry
i
inquired
my
uncle
was
dead
when
i
reached
california
and
had
willed
all
his
property
to
his
business
partner
the
will
had
been
presented
proved
and
probated
before
i
arrived
consequently
i
had
nothing
to
detain
me
so
i
set
out
for
home
and
here
i
am
as
poor
as
lazarus
broken
down
in
mind
and
body
and
desperate
enough
to
commit
suicide
if
it
was
not
cowardly
to
do
it
tell
me
the
news
ed
though
mind
you
i
am
not
prepared
for
good
news
i
could
not
bear
it
but
if
you
have
anything
very
unpleasant
please
let
me
hear
i
beg
you
will
not
talk
that
way
you
horrify
me
i
have
no
bad
news
at
least
nothing
worse
than
you
have
already
heard
the
day
for
the
trial
is
fixed
and
lottie
is
still
hopeful
but
you
know
she
is
by
nature
sanguine
so
far
as
my
own
views
are
concerned
i
am
frank
to
say
that
i
am
not
at
all
hopeful
when
i
talk
to
lottie
she
inspires
me
with
hope
but
when
i
talk
with
dabbs
and
tadpoddle
they
extinguish
all
they
have
both
been
required
to
enter
into
recognizance
for
their
appearance
as
witnesses
against
viola
rockland
and
doctor
dodson
have
determined
to
enter
a
plea
of
insanity
and
then
if
she
is
not
acquitted
they
are
confident
that
they
can
induce
the
governor
to
grant
a
pardon
the
governor
was
here
a
few
weeks
ago
and
spent
the
night
with
rockland
when
lottie
was
introduced
to
him
he
was
perfectly
fascinated
with
her
and
she
very
adroitly
managed
to
induce
the
governor
to
go
with
her
to
the
jail
next
morning
she
succeeded
in
persuading
him
to
be
introduced
to
miss
bramlett
and
he
expressed
great
solicitude
for
her
praised
lottie
very
much
and
when
he
left
he
intimated
a
wish
to
see
miss
bramlett
come
out
of
her
troubles
unscathed
i
have
no
doubt
that
he
will
pardon
viola
if
she
is
found
guilty
but
by
the
by
harry
how
came
your
uncle
to
will
all
his
money
to
his
partner
after
having
promised
to
give
it
to
you
indeed
i
don
t
know
the
fact
is
i
have
quit
trying
to
investigate
the
causes
of
things
of
late
i
was
not
at
all
surprised
when
i
was
told
that
such
a
will
had
been
made
the
will
was
made
several
years
ago
and
it
is
possible
that
my
uncle
may
have
contemplated
the
making
of
another
one
in
my
favor
but
his
death
was
very
sudden
and
wholly
unexpected
he
had
been
in
declining
health
but
his
condition
was
considered
by
no
means
critical
he
was
seized
with
paralysis
and
was
totally
unconscious
until
death
ensued
his
fortune
was
a
very
large
one
supposed
to
be
several
hundred
thousands
consisting
of
cash
mining
and
bank
stocks
the
will
was
witnessed
by
three
reputable
men
and
there
was
no
ground
to
doubt
its
proper
execution
i
took
the
advice
of
able
lawyers
had
them
to
investigate
the
case
and
they
told
me
that
it
would
be
folly
to
attempt
to
overthrow
the
what
a
pity
it
was
you
did
not
start
there
when
your
uncle
first
wrote
requesting
you
to
come
what
a
pity
it
was
that
such
a
wretch
as
i
was
ever
born
harry
don
t
talk
so
let
us
hope
for
brighter
hope
and
i
have
long
since
parted
company
and
misfortune
rules
the
roost
with
me
now
the
goddess
of
fortune
is
supposed
to
be
blind
but
that
is
a
grand
mistake
else
how
could
she
throw
her
darts
with
such
unerring
aim
at
my
poor
carcass
harry
you
have
met
with
many
disappointments
i
admit
but
you
know
the
sun
always
shines
brighter
after
a
storm
and
i
believe
if
you
will
put
your
trust
in
god
do
your
duty
with
a
brave
heart
and
command
your
passions
you
will
secure
happiness
don
t
lecture
me
ed
i
can
t
bear
it
i
have
committed
many
errors
i
confess
but
it
is
too
late
to
mend
the
matter
now
the
truth
is
i
am
nothing
but
a
walking
bulk
of
errors
anyway
and
the
sooner
i
die
the
better
it
will
be
for
the
dear
harry
you
distress
me
beyond
measure
by
talking
so
it
shows
a
lack
of
courage
a
disposition
to
shrink
from
trouble
when
it
no
doubt
you
think
so
it
is
very
easy
to
philosophize
about
other
people
s
troubles
but
let
the
whirlwind
sweep
away
all
your
hopes
of
happiness
and
dash
you
down
to
the
very
lowest
pit
of
despair
then
you
would
talk
differently
you
love
lottie
i
ah
harry
i
adore
her
i
worship
her
she
is
the
light
of
my
existence
the
delight
of
my
soul
my
very
heart
s
idol
my
angel
my
heaven
my
all
very
well
suppose
she
were
to
betray
you
and
sink
into
a
slough
of
infamy
as
deep
as
that
in
which
viola
has
sunk
could
you
then
lecture
so
eloquently
on
patience
and
hope
i
beseech
you
not
to
talk
that
way
it
sounds
like
a
sacrilege
to
me
you
don
t
state
a
supposable
case
my
lottie
is
as
pure
as
an
angel
in
so
i
was
foolish
enough
to
think
about
viola
i
had
as
much
faith
in
her
as
you
have
in
lottie
i
loved
her
as
well
as
it
is
possible
for
you
to
love
my
sister
i
believe
god
has
sent
this
awful
curse
upon
me
for
worshiping
one
of
his
creatures
instead
of
him
don
t
talk
to
me
about
the
honesty
of
women
how
could
you
expect
me
to
have
faith
in
them
since
viola
s
fall
ed
i
am
not
a
murderer
at
heart
but
that
damnable
villain
bowles
must
be
punished
if
he
will
fight
me
he
shall
have
a
fair
chance
if
not
he
must
take
the
consequences
you
know
he
first
insulted
lottie
and
i
knocked
him
down
with
a
stick
for
it
he
then
swore
he
would
have
revenge
if
he
took
a
to
get
it
and
when
he
found
out
that
i
loved
viola
he
began
to
invent
schemes
to
ruin
her
and
you
know
the
result
alas
too
well
he
is
a
shrewd
calculating
villain
and
i
dare
say
no
girl
left
like
viola
unprotected
could
withstand
his
devilish
plans
i
will
do
viola
the
justice
to
say
that
i
still
think
she
was
virtuous
but
what
can
a
poor
orphan
girl
do
when
such
a
cruel
villain
as
bowles
arrays
his
plans
for
her
destruction
druggists
will
compound
medicines
for
money
that
will
steal
away
the
thinking
faculties
of
the
brain
and
when
that
is
done
the
victory
is
easily
won
how
is
it
that
our
laws
will
allow
such
a
villain
to
march
in
triumph
over
the
ruined
hopes
of
honest
men
but
enough
of
this
ed
i
ll
settle
with
harry
you
certainly
don
t
mean
to
challenge
him
do
you
that
is
exactly
what
i
mean
to
do
and
if
he
refuses
to
fight
then
i
shall
punish
him
as
he
are
you
willing
to
violate
the
laws
of
the
land
are
you
not
aware
of
the
fact
that
it
is
made
murder
by
our
laws
to
kill
a
man
in
a
duel
a
curse
on
the
law
that
protects
the
villain
who
destroys
the
confiding
innocent
orphan
girl
as
bowles
has
destroyed
poor
viola
a
double
curse
on
the
law
that
protects
such
a
sneaking
cowardly
villain
no
ed
it
is
no
use
to
discuss
this
matter
because
my
mind
is
made
don
t
you
know
that
the
code
of
honor
as
some
men
call
it
is
no
longer
considered
the
code
of
honor
i
know
that
henry
clay
fought
his
duel
with
john
randolph
of
roanoke
i
know
that
commodore
barron
killed
commodore
decatur
in
a
duel
general
jackson
killed
dixon
in
a
duel
prentiss
wounded
foote
in
a
duel
general
sam
houston
shot
general
white
in
a
duel
i
know
that
general
albert
sidney
johnson
shot
his
man
in
a
duel
aaron
burr
killed
alexander
hamilton
in
a
duel
i
know
that
chambers
killed
lake
in
a
duel
the
world
did
not
condemn
these
men
for
fighting
duels
and
why
should
it
single
me
out
as
an
especial
object
for
condemnation
well
harry
you
can
t
deny
making
me
a
solemn
promise
that
you
would
not
seek
a
quarrel
with
bowles
until
after
viola
s
i
believe
i
did
make
such
a
promise
but
i
trust
you
will
release
me
from
it
as
things
have
changed
so
greatly
since
it
was
no
you
must
wait
until
after
the
trial
and
then
i
will
withdraw
all
objections
to
your
management
of
on
one
condition
i
will
renew
the
what
s
that
you
are
to
agree
not
to
interfere
with
me
and
my
plans
for
a
settlement
with
bowles
after
viola
s
trial
is
i
make
the
promise
on
those
terms
now
you
had
better
go
home
change
your
dress
and
seek
rest
for
you
appear
greatly
he
left
my
office
then
with
an
unsteady
step
and
i
did
not
see
him
any
more
that
day
another
source
of
trouble
now
began
to
lower
in
my
pathway
coming
from
an
unexpected
direction
so
far
as
it
affected
me
individually
it
was
greater
than
any
i
had
ever
before
experienced
trouble
divested
of
mystery
may
be
endured
but
when
it
takes
us
by
surprise
and
we
feel
the
blow
but
know
not
who
dealt
it
it
is
somewhat
hard
to
bear
such
was
the
blow
that
fell
on
me
i
could
feel
it
but
couldn
t
see
it
an
impenetrable
cloud
of
mystery
began
to
gather
around
me
mixing
itself
up
with
all
matters
in
which
i
was
interested
something
near
two
hundred
yards
east
of
rockland
s
residence
and
on
the
same
side
of
the
street
was
a
small
brick
situated
in
the
middle
of
a
small
inclosure
containing
i
suppose
about
a
quarter
of
an
acre
of
ground
the
plot
of
land
was
inclosed
with
pine
plank
not
over
three
and
a
half
feet
high
that
part
of
the
lot
which
lay
in
front
of
the
house
constituting
the
front
yard
was
thickly
set
with
short
untrimmed
shrubbery
while
the
other
had
been
used
as
a
vegetable
garden
there
were
only
four
rooms
in
the
house
two
in
the
lower
and
two
in
the
upper
story
and
a
narrow
hall
separated
the
two
lower
rooms
a
pair
of
steep
stairs
commenced
on
the
lower
floor
near
the
door
and
ended
on
the
back
side
of
the
house
on
the
upper
floor
the
building
itself
stood
in
a
low
flat
place
surrounded
with
rising
ground
on
all
sides
and
particularly
in
the
rear
where
a
tall
bluff
rose
up
fully
as
high
as
the
top
of
the
house
the
low
marshy
ground
where
the
building
was
located
and
the
unsightly
surroundings
rendered
it
very
undesirable
as
a
residence
i
suppose
it
was
owing
to
this
fact
that
it
was
most
of
the
time
unoccupied
there
were
no
locks
to
the
doors
and
the
house
had
for
a
long
time
been
uninhabited
save
by
some
lonely
tramp
who
now
and
then
sought
a
night
s
lodging
in
it
i
have
thought
it
expedient
to
give
a
minute
description
of
this
dismal
old
house
because
it
has
somewhat
to
do
with
my
history
about
the
time
harry
returned
from
california
a
rumor
began
to
circulate
among
the
negroes
who
are
by
nature
very
superstitious
to
the
effect
that
the
house
was
haunted
by
ghostly
visitors
every
night
of
course
this
story
was
not
believed
by
any
except
very
ignorant
persons
but
the
matter
began
to
attract
some
attention
nevertheless
because
those
who
did
not
believe
in
ghosts
were
of
the
opinion
that
perhaps
the
house
was
being
used
by
thieves
and
counterfeiters
at
any
rate
it
was
very
certain
that
one
of
the
upper
rooms
was
occupied
every
night
by
some
one
for
a
dim
light
was
often
seen
gliding
about
the
apartment
this
mysterious
circumstance
was
the
usual
topic
of
conversation
among
rockland
s
servants
the
coachman
was
an
old
negro
named
zack
he
was
as
full
of
superstitions
as
he
could
be
crammed
and
he
vowed
that
he
had
seen
a
ghost
all
robed
in
white
with
long
black
hair
streaming
down
her
back
and
a
face
as
white
as
snow
one
evening
i
met
harry
in
the
street
not
very
far
from
the
mysterious
house
he
cast
on
me
an
inquiring
look
and
spoke
as
if
irritated
about
something
what
woman
is
that
who
is
staying
in
that
old
brick
house
how
should
i
know
i
don
t
ask
you
how
you
know
but
i
demand
a
sensible
i
was
thunderstruck
by
his
manner
for
it
was
evident
that
he
was
very
much
enraged
about
something
why
do
you
not
make
me
an
answer
he
again
demanded
his
voice
still
rising
with
anger
really
harry
upon
my
word
of
honor
i
don
t
know
i
replied
mildly
i
don
t
believe
you
sir
he
exclaimed
as
he
stamped
his
foot
on
the
ground
be
cautious
how
you
attempt
to
deceive
me
i
am
not
in
the
humor
to
be
fooled
with
by
anybody
harry
i
implore
you
tell
me
what
you
mean
don
t
you
be
uneasy
about
what
i
mean
you
shall
know
to
your
sorrow
ere
long
or
my
name
is
not
harry
wallingford
i
am
not
such
a
simpleton
as
you
have
imagined
as
you
ll
find
out
one
of
these
days
i
am
not
a
coward
nor
am
i
a
bully
but
under
certain
circumstances
i
would
kill
a
man
i
am
heartily
sick
of
these
sentimental
hypocrites
who
pretend
to
be
a
man
s
friend
when
before
his
face
but
sneak
round
and
stab
him
in
the
dark
harry
are
you
mad
no
but
i
would
to
heaven
i
were
then
i
could
not
see
and
know
of
the
corruption
and
villainy
that
boils
and
bubbles
up
on
every
hand
we
are
in
the
very
middle
of
a
deep
sea
of
treachery
and
corruption
i
thought
i
had
one
honest
friend
but
alas
it
was
all
a
mistake
no
one
will
do
to
trust
they
are
all
hypocrites
harry
you
do
me
grievous
wrong
to
say
that
for
i
swear
by
everything
i
hold
sacred
that
never
have
i
either
by
word
thought
or
deed
intentionally
injured
you
i
call
upon
you
in
the
name
of
our
old
friendship
i
ask
you
as
a
man
of
honor
i
pray
you
in
the
name
of
dear
lottie
whom
we
both
love
i
ask
in
the
name
of
our
dead
mother
nay
i
ask
in
the
name
of
god
for
an
explanation
of
this
unmerited
insult
which
you
have
thrust
upon
me
i
warn
you
now
sir
that
i
will
not
permit
you
to
speak
of
my
dear
sister
lottie
she
is
not
for
such
as
you
and
the
sooner
you
realize
the
fact
the
better
it
will
be
for
you
it
shall
be
my
business
to
protect
her
and
you
may
be
sure
i
am
able
and
willing
to
do
it
if
ever
i
see
you
in
my
sister
s
company
again
you
will
hear
it
thunder
louder
than
you
ever
heard
it
before
i
give
you
fair
notice
now
and
if
you
value
your
life
let
me
advise
you
not
to
forget
what
i
am
saying
i
know
you
are
ready
with
an
explanation
but
your
oily
tongue
won
t
save
you
in
this
harry
do
you
mean
what
you
say
don
t
you
know
that
it
would
kill
me
to
give
lottie
up
you
would
not
have
our
engagement
broken
off
would
you
it
seems
that
you
are
rather
dull
of
comprehension
i
thought
my
language
was
exceedingly
plain
didn
t
i
tell
you
that
my
sister
was
not
for
your
sort
how
could
i
use
language
less
ambiguous
my
ire
was
now
roused
to
the
highest
pitch
and
i
made
a
desperate
struggle
to
smooth
it
down
to
some
extent
i
succeeded
but
not
entirely
i
never
will
surrender
my
claims
to
lottie
never
never
if
all
the
black
imps
from
the
infernal
regions
with
satan
at
their
head
were
here
to
oppose
me
i
would
not
yield
my
just
claim
to
her
hand
i
am
truly
glad
to
hear
you
talk
with
so
much
spirit
and
determination
because
i
was
afraid
that
you
were
cowardly
i
know
how
to
manage
a
brave
man
but
a
coward
puzzles
me
therefore
we
ll
see
whether
you
marry
my
sister
or
not
there
are
honest
gentlemen
in
this
city
worthy
in
all
respects
who
love
her
and
when
i
want
her
to
marry
she
can
find
a
husband
who
won
t
betray
in
heaven
s
name
what
have
i
done
i
have
no
more
business
with
you
just
now
sir
you
will
oblige
me
by
going
about
yours
if
you
have
any
if
however
you
have
no
business
you
had
better
go
anyway
as
i
am
done
with
you
for
the
harry
waved
his
hand
haughtily
for
me
to
leave
and
i
thought
i
had
to
oblige
him
i
never
had
seen
him
in
such
a
terrible
passion
before
of
all
the
troubles
that
i
had
ever
encountered
this
was
by
long
odds
the
greatest
to
think
that
harry
wallingford
the
only
brother
of
my
betrothed
bride
was
becoming
my
deadly
enemy
caused
my
heart
almost
to
die
within
my
breast
hadn
t
we
been
bosom
friends
from
early
boyhood
hadn
t
we
endured
our
sorrows
together
and
enjoyed
our
triumphs
jointly
wouldn
t
i
risk
my
life
and
everything
else
to
serve
him
what
had
i
done
to
justify
the
application
of
such
insults
to
me
as
i
walked
toward
my
office
i
felt
more
depressed
than
i
ever
had
felt
before
something
whispered
in
my
mind
a
horrible
tale
of
woes
to
come
i
knew
that
some
sneaking
villain
had
been
at
work
but
as
to
who
he
was
or
what
he
had
done
i
was
totally
ignorant
i
thought
it
best
to
go
and
see
lottie
at
once
i
then
turned
my
steps
in
the
direction
of
rockland
s
residence
hoping
to
have
an
interview
with
lottie
before
she
saw
her
brother
but
i
was
too
late
harry
had
been
with
her
for
over
an
hour
before
i
arrived
and
i
did
not
know
what
communications
he
had
made
to
her
until
a
long
time
afterward
if
i
had
been
advised
in
that
respect
an
ocean
of
trouble
might
have
been
avoided
lottie
met
me
at
the
front
gate
and
led
me
into
her
flower
garden
the
moment
my
eyes
looked
upon
her
i
discovered
that
something
serious
had
occurred
it
was
plain
to
be
seen
she
had
been
weeping
for
heaven
s
sake
eddie
she
whispered
as
she
took
my
arm
don
t
go
into
the
house
harry
is
there
and
in
such
a
passion
as
i
never
witnessed
before
and
i
pray
heaven
i
never
shall
again
what
on
earth
have
you
done
to
offend
him
nothing
whatever
that
i
am
aware
of
i
met
him
in
the
street
a
short
while
ago
and
he
abused
me
terribly
swore
that
i
never
should
marry
his
sister
and
threatened
to
kill
me
if
ever
he
saw
me
in
your
company
oh
eddie
go
quickly
yonder
he
comes
now
he
is
crazy
with
poison
keep
out
of
his
way
until
he
is
in
a
condition
to
listen
to
reason
i
would
have
obeyed
lottie
by
leaving
at
once
but
it
was
too
late
for
harry
was
within
twenty
paces
of
us
before
she
saw
him
he
was
walking
rapidly
toward
me
while
his
eyes
glared
with
anger
i
suspected
you
would
disregard
the
warning
i
gave
you
though
i
had
no
idea
you
would
have
the
boldness
to
do
it
so
soon
but
this
is
as
good
a
chance
to
settle
the
matter
as
one
could
wish
take
that
for
your
impudence
you
hypocritical
sneak
and
before
the
words
were
uttered
he
slapped
me
on
the
mouth
with
his
open
hand
i
raised
my
arm
to
strike
him
but
lottie
caught
me
don
t
strike
him
eddie
he
don
t
know
what
he
is
doing
my
arm
fell
harmless
by
my
side
and
if
he
had
given
me
a
dozen
blows
then
i
could
not
have
resented
it
how
could
i
have
the
heart
to
strike
my
darling
s
brother
when
her
eloquent
tongue
was
pleading
his
case
if
it
had
been
any
other
man
i
should
have
pounded
him
half
to
death
but
he
was
lottie
s
only
brother
and
she
loved
him
and
that
was
enough
i
resolved
then
and
there
that
i
never
would
hurt
him
no
matter
what
he
might
do
i
could
have
tied
him
without
an
effort
because
he
was
a
mere
skeleton
anyway
oh
brother
has
it
come
to
this
exclaimed
lottie
as
she
stood
trembling
and
weeping
between
us
how
could
you
have
the
heart
to
strike
our
eddie
how
could
you
be
so
cruel
as
to
strike
those
lips
that
have
uttered
so
many
kind
words
to
you
have
you
forgotten
the
fact
that
i
owe
my
life
to
those
lips
which
are
now
smarting
from
your
cruel
blow
lottie
screamed
harry
as
he
seized
her
by
the
arm
and
dashed
her
back
roughly
against
the
wall
of
the
don
t
you
know
that
ed
demar
is
a
deceitful
coward
who
has
betrayed
you
no
no
ten
thousand
times
no
replied
the
dear
girl
as
the
tears
streamed
down
her
cheeks
if
god
ever
created
an
honest
man
it
is
my
eddie
don
t
i
know
him
haven
t
i
been
with
him
through
sorrow
and
through
joy
and
don
t
i
know
his
honest
heart
no
brother
harry
no
one
can
shake
my
confidence
in
him
nothing
ever
shall
make
me
doubt
him
i
tell
you
sister
you
must
and
shall
cease
to
receive
visits
from
that
deceitful
wretch
when
i
tell
you
he
is
a
traitor
to
you
i
only
say
that
which
i
know
of
my
own
knowledge
i
only
inform
you
of
what
i
beheld
with
my
own
eyes
this
is
no
hearsay
evidence
this
is
no
report
of
a
detective
but
it
is
a
fact
i
beheld
dear
brother
i
beg
you
to
hush
you
are
laboring
under
some
unaccountable
delusion
your
trouble
has
been
so
great
that
it
has
clouded
your
judgment
you
know
that
no
sister
ever
loved
a
dear
brother
as
i
love
you
i
am
sure
that
you
would
not
tell
a
willful
falsehood
under
any
circumstances
but
i
implore
you
to
let
this
matter
drop
for
the
present
wait
until
you
have
time
for
reflection
it
is
so
easy
to
commit
irreparable
errors
so
easy
to
do
things
that
can
not
be
undone
listen
to
your
devoted
sister
won
t
you
if
you
will
drive
that
cowardly
sneak
from
my
sight
i
promise
you
to
let
the
matter
drop
for
the
present
but
if
he
remains
here
another
moment
i
can
not
answer
for
the
please
leave
us
now
eddie
said
lottie
as
she
laid
her
hand
on
my
arm
and
cast
on
me
an
imploring
look
leave
him
with
me
until
i
can
pacify
him
and
then
i
will
send
for
you
when
he
will
hear
an
explanation
you
have
not
betrayed
me
have
you
eddie
before
high
heaven
i
answer
no
i
believe
you
and
will
always
trust
what
are
you
whispering
to
that
hypocrite
for
why
don
t
you
order
him
to
leave
here
as
i
have
directed
you
had
better
not
tax
my
patience
too
far
i
thought
it
best
to
leave
him
with
lottie
hoping
that
she
would
be
able
to
keep
him
quiet
until
his
better
judgment
should
come
to
his
assistance
as
i
made
my
way
toward
my
office
i
began
to
ponder
over
what
had
occurred
and
you
may
be
sure
that
my
thoughts
were
anything
but
pleasant
my
cheeks
burned
with
indignation
when
i
thought
of
the
blow
i
had
received
and
i
felt
my
leaving
me
i
began
to
feel
that
i
had
acted
cowardly
in
submitting
to
such
treatment
who
but
an
arrant
coward
would
have
quietly
taken
such
an
insult
from
mortal
man
then
on
the
other
hand
i
argued
the
case
thus
how
could
i
strike
the
brother
of
lottie
when
i
know
how
dearly
she
loves
him
did
she
not
beg
me
not
to
return
the
blow
how
could
i
do
anything
against
her
wish
then
i
thought
of
his
feeble
health
and
the
great
troubles
he
had
endured
and
finally
satisfied
myself
that
i
had
acted
right
in
not
punishing
him
but
the
mystery
in
which
the
whole
affair
was
clothed
puzzled
and
perplexed
me
and
the
more
i
discussed
the
matter
in
my
mind
the
greater
grew
my
curiosity
could
it
be
possible
that
harry
was
laboring
under
a
mental
hallucination
or
was
some
enemy
of
mine
at
work
to
undermine
me
could
it
be
that
heartsell
was
at
work
in
secret
to
turn
lottie
against
me
in
order
to
secure
the
prize
himself
those
questions
and
a
thousand
others
of
a
similar
character
came
trooping
across
my
mind
until
my
brain
seemed
to
be
on
fire
the
course
that
lottie
had
pursued
had
the
effect
to
counterbalance
the
influence
that
the
other
circumstances
were
producing
she
refused
to
distrust
me
and
i
believed
that
they
never
would
be
able
to
shake
her
confidence
in
me
i
felt
that
i
could
endure
any
amount
of
misery
so
long
as
she
was
my
friend
and
remained
true
to
me
i
must
now
tell
you
of
an
event
that
had
transpired
on
the
night
before
the
rupture
between
harry
and
myself
a
thing
about
which
i
was
not
informed
until
a
long
time
after
it
happened
it
was
not
until
after
the
great
mischief
had
been
done
that
i
was
advised
of
its
cause
if
i
had
been
informed
at
the
proper
time
irreparable
misfortunes
could
have
been
prevented
but
perhaps
i
had
better
proceed
to
tell
what
it
was
that
had
enraged
harry
against
me
early
on
the
morning
of
the
day
previous
to
that
on
which
he
had
insulted
and
struck
me
heartsell
called
to
see
him
stating
that
he
had
some
private
communications
to
make
to
him
they
went
into
the
and
took
seats
on
the
wooden
bench
the
very
spot
where
lottie
first
promised
to
be
my
wife
mr
wallingford
began
heartsell
as
soon
as
they
were
seated
the
communication
which
i
propose
to
make
will
not
be
pleasant
for
you
to
hear
yet
i
honestly
believe
it
is
my
duty
to
tell
you
of
course
you
are
aware
of
the
relations
heretofore
existing
between
myself
and
your
charming
sister
i
loved
her
very
devotedly
and
as
you
know
asked
her
to
marry
me
but
she
declined
very
candidly
informing
me
that
she
loved
doctor
demar
the
frank
manner
in
which
she
answered
my
offer
of
marriage
and
the
courteous
manner
in
which
she
treated
me
rather
increased
my
affection
for
her
to
be
more
plain
i
still
love
your
sister
and
would
make
any
sacrifice
to
secure
her
happiness
i
had
reconciled
myself
to
my
fate
and
was
willing
to
bear
my
disappointment
with
becoming
fortitude
so
long
as
i
had
reason
to
hope
that
your
sister
would
be
happy
but
when
i
became
convinced
that
she
was
about
to
marry
a
man
who
was
unworthy
of
her
a
man
who
to
say
the
least
is
a
hypocritical
scoundrel
i
determined
to
make
known
to
you
what
i
had
discovered
edward
demar
is
either
married
to
another
woman
or
he
is
living
with
her
mr
heartsell
i
would
not
believe
such
a
story
if
you
were
to
bring
a
dozen
men
to
swear
it
i
have
known
ed
demar
from
boyhood
to
this
day
and
if
he
is
not
an
honest
man
i
must
confess
that
there
are
i
did
not
expect
you
to
believe
it
for
to
be
candid
with
you
i
would
not
have
believed
it
myself
had
i
not
seen
it
with
my
own
eyes
i
can
readily
understand
the
fact
that
such
confidence
as
you
have
placed
in
demar
is
very
hard
to
shake
but
you
can
see
for
yourself
if
you
think
enough
of
your
sister
s
happiness
to
induce
you
to
do
how
do
you
mean
that
i
may
see
for
myself
ed
demar
brought
a
beautiful
woman
with
him
from
philadelphia
and
as
i
have
already
told
you
she
is
either
his
wife
or
his
mistress
i
don
t
know
which
he
has
her
hidden
in
that
old
brick
house
just
over
yonder
in
that
flat
she
has
lately
been
moved
in
that
house
he
had
her
concealed
in
another
part
of
the
city
but
he
has
lately
moved
her
to
that
old
building
i
think
they
are
making
arrangements
to
elope
as
i
have
overheard
some
of
their
conversations
he
is
to
visit
her
at
ten
o
clock
and
if
you
wish
to
satisfy
yourself
as
to
the
truth
of
my
statements
i
will
go
with
you
to
a
spot
where
you
can
see
with
your
own
heartsell
said
harry
as
he
rose
from
his
seat
his
eyes
flashing
with
anger
if
you
have
slandered
demar
i
will
take
your
life
and
if
he
has
betrayed
my
sister
i
ll
kill
him
very
good
you
may
take
my
life
and
welcome
if
you
find
my
statement
false
will
you
go
with
me
so
as
to
make
the
test
as
to
who
is
to
be
killed
yes
i
will
but
i
despise
to
play
the
spy
or
so
do
i
so
does
any
gentleman
but
how
can
you
catch
a
traitor
without
doing
it
true
true
but
where
shall
we
meet
here
at
this
very
spot
meet
me
here
at
and
you
shall
be
convinced
by
the
by
let
us
compare
our
time
so
as
to
make
no
after
the
two
watches
were
compared
and
set
with
each
other
heartsell
took
his
leave
while
harry
sat
immovable
and
silent
with
a
mind
full
of
gloomy
thoughts
could
it
be
true
that
edward
demar
was
the
treacherous
hypocrite
heartsell
represented
him
to
be
his
heart
fluttered
with
emotions
of
anger
when
he
thought
of
the
effect
such
a
blow
would
have
on
lottie
harry
loved
lottie
with
all
his
heart
and
woe
to
the
man
who
dared
to
betray
her
harry
was
at
the
rendezvous
promptly
and
had
only
been
there
a
few
moments
when
he
saw
heartsell
approaching
how
long
have
you
been
here
wallingford
inquired
heartsell
as
he
approached
only
a
moment
was
the
whispered
reply
speak
low
heartsell
my
sister
is
in
the
garden
and
i
don
t
want
her
to
know
anything
about
this
alas
wallingford
she
will
hear
it
soon
enough
heaven
knows
yes
and
it
will
be
a
fearful
blow
to
her
indeed
for
she
loves
demar
devotedly
but
i
can
not
believe
he
is
the
treacherous
scoundrel
you
think
he
i
did
not
believe
it
either
until
i
was
forced
to
but
come
it
is
time
we
were
i
feel
ashamed
of
myself
why
because
this
is
the
first
time
i
ever
did
anything
on
the
sly
i
think
we
are
engaged
in
a
very
small
if
you
love
your
sister
how
can
you
consider
it
a
small
business
to
take
steps
to
rescue
her
from
the
clutches
of
an
unworthy
villain
of
course
not
but
these
steps
ought
to
be
taken
openly
and
not
in
the
true
enough
but
don
t
they
always
employ
detectives
to
catch
the
thief
yes
the
best
detectives
are
the
shrewdest
while
this
conversation
was
progressing
harry
and
his
companion
were
walking
quietly
toward
the
gloomy
old
house
their
arms
locked
in
each
other
the
moon
was
struggling
through
the
clouds
that
were
moving
briskly
from
the
south
toward
the
north
every
now
and
then
coming
out
between
them
and
spreading
a
temporary
light
over
the
earth
this
is
a
most
favorable
night
for
our
business
wallingford
observed
heartsell
as
the
moon
darted
out
between
the
two
dark
clouds
lighting
up
the
road
nearly
as
bright
as
day
why
so
because
we
will
be
able
to
see
all
we
what
do
you
mean
you
talk
is
if
it
would
afford
you
pleasure
to
witness
the
downfall
of
pshaw
wallingford
you
don
t
know
me
i
merely
meant
to
say
that
it
was
a
favorable
night
to
detect
this
rascal
in
his
treachery
i
assure
you
i
should
be
gratified
to
find
it
all
a
it
seems
to
me
impossible
for
it
to
be
anything
else
but
a
mistake
and
i
feel
my
cheeks
burning
with
shame
i
feel
degraded
at
the
underhanded
sneaking
course
we
are
i
don
t
doubt
it
i
can
readily
understand
the
reason
you
thought
your
friend
demar
was
honest
and
that
his
pretended
love
for
your
sister
was
all
reality
but
wait
a
while
and
see
if
you
don
t
change
your
opinion
of
him
by
the
way
here
we
are
that
is
the
house
we
had
better
turn
off
to
the
right
and
take
up
our
position
back
of
the
building
by
standing
on
the
bluff
there
we
can
observe
what
transpires
within
for
there
are
several
glasses
broken
out
of
the
rear
windows
and
this
will
enable
us
to
get
a
full
view
of
the
interior
come
this
way
wallingford
we
ll
hide
ourselves
behind
this
tree
where
we
will
be
on
a
level
with
the
second
story
and
in
hearing
distance
of
the
room
by
the
way
there
she
is
now
watching
for
him
speak
very
low
else
she
will
hear
us
she
is
remarkably
pretty
don
t
you
think
so
yes
but
she
looks
as
pale
as
death
and
appears
to
be
very
ah
yes
poor
lady
i
dare
say
she
has
cause
to
be
sad
no
doubt
she
has
been
betrayed
by
that
scoundrel
and
is
now
beginning
to
realize
her
situation
see
she
is
preparing
supper
for
some
hush
heartsell
i
hear
footsteps
coming
this
way
listen
don
t
you
hear
them
yes
and
by
the
way
that
is
he
now
stand
close
behind
this
tree
or
he
will
see
us
for
he
is
coming
directly
toward
us
a
plague
on
the
moon
i
wish
it
would
get
behind
that
cloud
i
fear
he
will
see
us
look
she
is
coming
down
to
meet
him
he
is
getting
over
the
fence
at
the
corner
yonder
and
will
pass
within
ten
feet
of
us
now
take
a
good
look
at
his
face
as
he
comes
along
this
way
and
tell
me
who
he
that
is
ed
demar
beyond
all
of
course
it
is
but
see
he
has
stopped
and
seems
to
be
watching
for
some
one
now
he
is
moving
this
way
again
hark
what
noise
was
that
he
made
it
with
his
cane
by
tapping
on
the
plank
fence
i
dare
say
it
was
a
signal
to
notify
the
woman
of
his
arrival
for
she
is
going
out
to
meet
look
wallingford
he
has
taken
her
in
his
arms
how
does
that
suit
you
for
a
husband
for
your
sister
i
ll
kill
him
if
they
hang
me
as
high
as
haman
for
it
dear
eddie
exclaimed
the
woman
as
she
threw
herself
into
the
man
s
arms
what
made
you
stay
away
so
long
i
have
been
lonesome
and
miserable
i
can
not
endure
this
suspense
much
longer
it
is
killing
me
when
will
you
take
me
away
from
this
horrible
place
darling
within
two
or
three
days
at
farthest
my
dear
was
the
reply
as
he
pressed
her
again
to
his
heart
what
would
your
sister
think
of
this
hypocritical
scoundrel
if
she
knew
what
he
was
don
t
mention
my
sister
s
name
in
connection
with
the
traitor
she
shall
not
be
annoyed
with
him
any
more
you
may
depend
on
that
but
hark
he
is
speaking
to
her
let
us
has
any
one
been
here
mollie
said
the
man
as
he
led
her
into
the
house
no
one
has
been
in
the
house
but
i
saw
a
man
standing
on
the
bluff
there
yesterday
and
thought
from
his
conduct
he
was
watching
the
i
dare
say
he
was
because
i
begin
to
suspect
that
we
are
watched
and
this
makes
me
the
more
anxious
to
get
away
from
come
in
dear
i
know
you
are
hungry
and
i
have
prepared
you
a
nice
supper
with
my
own
hands
i
have
made
you
a
cup
of
strong
tea
and
broiled
you
a
you
are
very
thoughtful
mollie
and
i
consider
myself
eminently
blessed
by
your
love
i
feel
that
i
am
unworthy
of
such
good
fortune
i
don
t
think
i
could
endure
my
troubles
but
for
the
sustaining
influence
of
your
love
and
oh
eddie
if
we
could
escape
to
some
distant
land
where
no
one
would
know
us
where
we
could
feel
safe
how
happy
we
should
be
yes
darling
and
that
is
precisely
what
i
mean
to
do
soon
i
would
do
it
now
but
there
is
an
unfortunate
little
affair
that
detains
me
here
though
i
will
get
it
off
my
hands
as
soon
as
the
man
had
dispatched
his
supper
the
woman
removed
the
dishes
and
returned
to
where
her
lover
sat
and
began
to
play
with
his
long
shaggy
hair
it
was
evident
from
her
conduct
that
she
loved
him
devotedly
for
she
ever
and
anon
bent
over
and
stamped
a
kiss
on
his
lips
while
her
long
black
hair
fell
unconfined
about
his
face
let
us
leave
this
place
heartsell
whispered
harry
i
shall
die
with
disgust
i
can
not
command
my
feelings
much
longer
oh
what
a
shame
it
is
to
see
what
i
have
beheld
i
have
often
seen
my
sister
kiss
that
rascal
s
lips
and
shower
a
thousand
endearing
expressions
on
him
he
made
her
believe
he
loved
her
and
i
have
heard
him
swear
by
everything
sacred
that
he
never
cared
for
any
other
woman
i
don
t
believe
it
would
be
wrong
to
shoot
him
down
like
a
dog
though
i
mean
to
give
him
a
chance
for
his
life
he
or
i
must
leave
the
world
and
that
very
soon
heartsell
lottie
must
know
of
this
yes
i
think
it
best
to
tell
her
everything
poor
girl
it
will
nearly
kill
her
i
deeply
sympathize
with
her
and
would
freely
lay
down
my
life
to
secure
her
you
shall
marry
her
if
you
want
her
because
you
have
saved
her
i
think
she
will
be
guided
by
my
wishes
when
she
finds
how
she
has
been
deceived
in
that
wallingford
if
she
would
love
me
as
she
has
loved
that
unworthy
scoundrel
i
would
be
the
happiest
man
on
she
can
t
fail
to
love
you
when
she
learns
how
you
have
worked
to
save
her
but
come
we
must
go
now
we
can
discuss
that
matter
at
another
wait
a
moment
they
are
drawing
the
curtains
down
there
they
have
put
out
the
heartsell
and
harry
remained
by
the
tree
until
after
midnight
darkness
and
silence
pervaded
the
premises
and
it
was
certain
that
the
parties
had
retired
when
they
turned
and
walked
back
to
rockland
s
wallingford
said
heartsell
i
ll
see
you
again
early
in
the
good
night
heartsell
don
t
fail
to
come
harry
went
to
his
room
but
found
it
useless
to
try
to
sleep
therefore
he
spent
the
night
in
arranging
his
plans
for
the
morrow
chapter
xxiii
i
was
in
my
office
early
the
next
morning
after
i
had
the
difficulty
with
harry
i
had
passed
a
sleepless
night
a
miserable
wretched
night
and
was
nervous
and
irritable
when
i
arrived
there
i
had
not
been
at
the
office
five
minutes
when
a
little
negro
boy
came
hurriedly
in
and
handed
me
a
letter
i
saw
in
an
instant
it
was
from
lottie
i
broke
the
envelope
and
read
it
eagerly
dear
eddie
for
heaven
s
sake
keep
out
of
harry
s
way
he
is
crazy
with
passion
refuses
to
listen
to
reason
i
have
never
known
him
to
exhibit
such
ungovernable
rage
before
he
makes
the
most
horrible
charges
against
you
and
swears
he
will
kill
you
what
on
earth
does
it
all
mean
poor
boy
he
did
not
sleep
a
wink
last
night
but
walked
the
floor
all
the
time
muttering
curses
against
you
there
is
some
awful
secret
at
the
bottom
of
it
all
some
strange
mystery
i
fear
some
scheming
enemy
of
yours
has
been
planning
your
destruction
by
all
means
avoid
a
meeting
with
harry
until
the
matter
can
be
investigated
i
was
on
my
knees
the
night
praying
for
you
and
my
poor
brother
my
reliance
is
on
god
and
let
me
beg
you
to
trust
in
him
too
he
will
clear
the
dark
clouds
from
our
sky
if
we
put
our
faith
in
him
harry
is
so
different
from
what
he
used
to
be
so
completely
metamorphosed
he
used
to
be
so
gentle
so
kind
always
grieving
for
others
troubles
never
thinking
of
himself
so
devoted
to
you
so
loving
to
me
but
alas
what
is
he
now
all
passion
terrible
passion
gloomy
irritable
suspicious
jealous
and
querulous
and
poor
boy
i
am
afraid
he
is
losing
his
reason
i
thought
i
was
brave
i
imagined
no
misfortune
could
overcome
me
but
this
blow
has
been
too
heavy
for
me
this
awful
suspense
is
more
than
i
can
bear
if
you
see
stains
on
this
sheet
of
paper
you
know
what
made
them
my
eyes
have
not
been
dry
since
the
sad
occurrences
of
yesterday
they
have
been
trying
to
make
me
believe
my
darling
is
untrue
to
me
but
they
never
can
do
that
i
am
not
a
bit
jealous
i
think
i
know
all
the
goodness
of
his
noble
heart
and
i
never
shall
believe
that
he
would
deceive
me
but
i
must
close
now
for
my
time
is
limited
again
i
beseech
you
not
to
meet
harry
your
true
faithful
i
had
scarcely
finished
reading
lottie
s
letter
when
heartsell
walked
into
the
office
and
without
speaking
handed
me
a
note
from
harry
if
a
bolt
of
thunder
had
knocked
the
roof
off
of
the
house
over
my
head
it
would
have
startled
me
less
than
the
contents
of
the
note
but
i
have
it
here
now
and
will
read
it
to
you
doctor
edward
demar
sir
circumstances
not
necessary
for
me
to
mention
have
rendered
it
expedient
for
me
to
inform
you
that
you
and
i
can
no
longer
live
in
the
same
city
i
will
go
further
and
inform
you
that
the
time
has
come
when
you
must
answer
for
your
dishonorable
conduct
if
you
have
any
sense
of
honor
left
you
will
readily
accord
to
me
the
only
satisfaction
that
i
require
to
be
plain
i
demand
that
you
name
a
time
and
place
without
the
limits
of
the
state
when
and
where
we
can
settle
the
matters
of
difference
between
us
my
friend
heartsell
is
authorized
to
arrange
preliminaries
with
you
or
any
friend
you
may
choose
to
represent
you
respectfully
h
mr
heartsell
said
i
endeavoring
to
keep
control
of
my
feelings
am
i
to
understand
this
as
a
challenge
to
fight
a
duel
the
language
used
is
very
plain
sir
and
such
was
the
intention
of
my
friend
when
he
wrote
but
i
am
opposed
to
the
barbarous
practice
of
dueling
the
laws
of
the
land
prohibit
it
public
sentiment
condemns
it
and
if
i
were
not
opposed
to
dueling
i
could
not
fight
harry
wallingford
i
would
not
hurt
him
for
everything
in
the
world
and
why
should
he
wish
to
take
my
life
i
never
injured
him
i
love
his
sister
she
is
my
betrothed
bride
and
i
would
as
soon
think
of
killing
myself
as
that
sir
is
a
matter
with
which
i
have
nothing
to
do
but
you
are
mistaken
when
you
say
that
public
sentiment
condemns
the
code
of
honor
i
think
the
very
reverse
of
that
is
true
because
it
is
considered
disgraceful
to
back
down
when
challenged
the
man
who
refuses
to
fight
when
challenged
is
branded
as
a
coward
and
honorable
men
shun
him
as
such
did
public
sentiment
condemn
henry
clay
prentiss
albert
johnson
general
jackson
and
a
thousand
others
i
might
name
yes
but
public
sentiment
has
undergone
a
great
change
since
then
and
our
laws
did
not
prohibit
dueling
then
doctor
demar
can
you
name
any
one
who
has
ever
been
punished
for
fighting
a
duel
i
am
sorry
to
be
compelled
to
answer
in
the
i
dare
say
you
will
admit
that
the
reason
is
owing
to
public
sentiment
but
to
the
point
what
answer
do
you
wish
me
to
convey
to
my
friend
wallingford
give
me
one
hour
to
consider
on
the
matter
and
to
take
the
advice
of
my
certainly
but
it
will
be
considered
dishonorable
to
mention
the
matter
to
more
than
one
friend
and
were
you
to
do
so
it
might
cause
the
civil
authorities
to
get
hold
of
the
affair
which
you
know
would
serve
to
widen
the
breach
between
you
and
my
friend
mr
heartsell
do
you
know
what
has
caused
harry
wallingford
to
become
offended
with
me
oh
yes
doctor
demar
your
little
secret
is
out
and
you
must
face
the
what
do
you
mean
by
my
little
secret
being
out
pshaw
demar
don
t
undertake
to
brass
it
out
that
way
but
never
mind
i
ll
call
again
at
the
end
of
an
hour
and
get
your
answer
by
the
way
demar
you
had
better
accept
the
challenge
as
that
might
be
the
shortest
road
to
an
adjustment
of
this
business
because
if
you
refuse
to
meet
wallingford
on
the
field
he
will
force
you
to
fight
him
on
the
streets
if
you
consent
to
meet
him
a
few
rounds
may
satisfy
him
when
the
matter
could
be
settled
but
if
you
decline
i
dread
to
think
of
the
consequences
you
know
his
fiery
temper
as
well
as
i
do
he
is
very
rash
and
inconsiderate
and
is
very
much
enraged
against
you
think
of
these
things
when
you
are
considering
the
proper
answer
to
be
sent
for
the
present
i
ll
call
again
for
your
for
full
ten
minutes
i
sat
silently
gazing
at
space
and
pondering
over
the
situation
perfectly
at
a
loss
as
to
what
course
would
be
best
for
me
to
pursue
one
thing
i
had
made
up
my
mind
that
i
never
would
under
any
consideration
draw
one
drop
of
harry
wallingford
s
blood
i
never
would
point
a
loaded
pistol
at
his
body
i
would
as
soon
think
of
shooting
out
my
own
brains
as
his
but
i
knew
that
something
must
be
done
and
that
without
delay
who
should
i
go
to
for
advice
was
the
next
question
to
be
considered
i
first
thought
of
doctor
dodson
but
he
was
getting
old
and
was
by
nature
very
excitable
i
decided
that
it
was
best
not
to
mention
the
matter
to
him
at
last
i
concluded
to
submit
the
matter
to
general
calloway
a
personal
friend
who
had
done
many
acts
of
kindness
for
me
during
my
boyhood
i
knew
he
was
brave
and
and
had
often
succeeded
in
settling
affairs
of
honor
without
letting
the
parties
resort
to
arms
general
calloway
was
a
man
whose
opinions
were
respected
by
the
community
and
he
was
personally
popular
with
every
one
who
knew
him
i
was
sure
that
if
any
one
could
bring
about
a
reconciliation
between
harry
and
me
he
was
the
man
to
do
it
so
i
went
directly
to
his
quarters
and
stated
the
case
to
him
and
requested
him
to
assist
me
let
it
be
understood
at
the
start
general
said
i
that
i
will
under
no
circumstances
shoot
at
harry
wallingford
but
if
you
think
it
best
for
me
to
stand
up
and
let
him
shoot
me
i
will
do
it
no
man
knows
whether
he
is
a
coward
or
not
until
he
is
tried
but
i
am
vain
enough
to
believe
that
i
can
stand
up
and
let
him
shoot
at
me
if
the
matter
can
not
be
adjusted
without
what
is
the
cause
of
the
trouble
between
you
and
wallingford
the
general
inquired
i
have
not
the
most
remote
idea
and
the
strangest
part
of
the
matter
is
they
refuse
to
tell
me
if
i
have
given
cause
for
offense
i
am
ignorant
of
it
but
wallingford
is
so
overmastered
with
passion
that
he
will
not
listen
to
one
who
demands
any
very
well
demar
said
the
general
leave
the
matter
in
my
hands
and
i
ll
settle
it
without
resort
to
arms
meantime
you
go
across
the
state
line
into
mississippi
and
take
lodgings
near
horn
lake
on
the
line
of
the
mississippi
and
tennessee
railroad
you
had
better
go
down
there
this
evening
and
i
will
answer
wallingford
s
note
in
which
i
shall
promise
him
a
meeting
morning
at
ten
o
clock
i
have
always
found
it
much
easier
to
bring
about
an
amicable
settlement
of
such
cases
on
the
field
than
in
the
city
and
i
never
yet
have
failed
to
secure
an
adjustment
where
either
one
of
the
parties
desired
it
but
when
both
parties
mount
their
high
horses
then
we
encounter
trouble
we
will
make
wallingford
listen
to
reason
we
will
first
demand
of
him
a
full
statement
of
the
grievances
of
which
he
complains
and
then
we
will
know
how
to
start
about
making
a
settlement
sit
down
a
moment
i
ll
write
the
answer
to
be
i
took
a
seat
until
general
galloway
wrote
the
following
harry
wallingford
dear
sir
your
note
of
this
date
demanding
of
me
the
designation
of
a
time
and
place
without
the
limits
of
this
state
for
the
purpose
of
discussing
certain
matters
of
difference
between
us
was
handed
to
me
by
heartsell
i
have
the
honor
in
reply
to
name
horn
lake
mississippi
as
the
place
and
ten
o
clock
morning
as
the
time
which
i
hope
will
suit
your
convenience
any
other
preliminaries
which
you
may
desire
to
have
arranged
may
be
done
on
the
part
of
my
friend
general
calloway
very
respectfully
edward
now
demar
you
go
to
the
livery
stable
get
a
horse
and
buggy
and
go
to
horn
lake
don
t
lodge
in
the
town
nor
don
t
let
any
one
know
your
business
in
fact
you
had
better
conceal
yourself
in
the
country
near
the
village
i
will
come
down
early
in
the
morning
when
i
feel
confident
we
shall
have
no
difficulty
in
securing
a
reconciliation
between
you
and
as
soon
as
i
reached
my
office
i
wrote
a
long
letter
to
lottie
and
when
it
was
finished
i
sealed
and
directed
it
to
her
then
gave
it
to
our
clerk
and
ordered
him
to
give
it
to
lottie
at
eight
o
clock
on
the
next
evening
provided
i
did
not
return
by
that
time
mr
todd
said
i
as
i
handed
the
letter
to
him
i
am
going
on
a
short
journey
and
hope
to
be
back
evening
if
however
i
do
not
return
by
eight
o
clock
you
will
deliver
this
letter
to
miss
wallingford
with
your
own
hands
you
will
under
no
circumstances
trust
it
out
of
your
possession
but
carry
it
to
her
he
stared
at
me
in
a
suspicious
manner
for
several
seconds
and
then
said
doctor
if
any
one
inquires
for
you
what
answer
shall
i
make
oh
anything
you
choose
as
to
that
i
suppose
no
one
will
care
to
know
where
i
have
gone
so
they
are
told
when
i
will
i
then
went
toward
the
livery
stable
intending
to
hire
a
conveyance
to
take
me
to
horn
lake
but
met
one
of
the
railroad
employes
who
told
me
that
a
freight
train
was
going
out
soon
and
i
hastened
to
the
depot
in
time
to
jump
on
it
as
it
was
moving
out
when
the
train
stopped
at
horn
lake
i
stepped
off
and
immediately
started
to
walk
rapidly
southward
i
obtained
lodgings
for
the
night
at
a
about
a
mile
from
the
village
intending
to
meet
general
calloway
early
next
morning
according
to
previous
agreement
but
providence
had
in
store
for
me
a
different
fate
as
you
shall
shortly
know
it
was
nearly
night
when
i
arrived
at
the
and
after
resting
a
few
moments
i
took
a
stroll
through
a
patch
of
timbered
land
that
lay
near
the
house
i
felt
that
i
wanted
to
be
alone
in
order
to
have
a
reckoning
with
myself
and
to
sum
up
probabilities
in
regard
to
the
future
i
wandered
along
through
the
woods
not
thinking
where
i
was
going
or
anything
about
the
objects
by
which
i
was
surrounded
until
i
found
myself
on
the
shore
of
a
beautiful
lake
seating
myself
at
the
root
of
a
tree
i
took
lottie
s
picture
from
my
bosom
covered
it
with
kisses
and
bedewed
it
with
my
bitter
tears
as
i
held
the
darling
picture
before
my
tearful
eyes
the
question
whether
or
not
i
should
ever
see
her
again
presented
itself
to
my
mind
would
i
be
forced
to
fight
the
duel
with
harry
on
the
morrow
would
i
be
killed
and
carried
back
a
corpse
these
unwelcome
queries
intruded
themselves
unbidden
on
my
mind
i
will
not
admit
that
i
was
a
coward
yet
i
did
not
want
to
die
then
i
had
too
much
to
live
for
the
scenery
by
which
i
was
surrounded
was
surpassingly
charming
the
smooth
quiet
bosom
of
the
lake
spread
its
shining
surface
before
me
and
as
the
slanting
rays
of
the
departing
sun
danced
on
the
still
waters
a
thousand
streaks
of
variegated
lights
were
reflected
against
the
wall
of
trees
that
lined
the
shore
my
eyes
were
dazzled
by
the
bright
beauty
of
the
scene
large
flocks
of
wild
ducks
lazily
swam
about
on
the
calm
surface
of
the
water
frequently
coming
within
a
rod
of
where
i
sat
while
thousands
of
beautiful
fishes
came
in
droves
and
began
to
poke
their
heads
up
to
the
top
of
the
water
near
me
great
numbers
of
birds
collected
on
the
trees
above
me
and
filled
all
the
air
around
with
a
delicious
melody
all
nature
seemed
to
be
making
an
effort
to
show
me
the
beauties
of
the
world
that
i
was
about
to
leave
forever
she
appeared
to
be
arrayed
in
her
richest
costume
and
soliciting
me
not
to
leave
her
why
will
man
be
so
cruel
to
his
fellow
man
as
to
try
to
push
him
out
of
such
a
beautiful
world
why
can
we
not
live
as
brothers
and
enjoy
the
charms
of
nature
instead
of
striving
to
destroy
each
other
what
a
happy
world
would
this
be
if
every
man
would
live
by
the
golden
rule
do
unto
others
as
you
would
have
others
do
unto
you
penitentiaries
and
jails
would
be
unknown
locks
and
keys
would
be
unnecessary
implements
of
war
would
not
be
manufactured
forts
and
arsenals
would
not
be
built
poorhouses
and
poverty
would
be
unknown
police
officers
would
be
unnecessary
and
would
be
converted
into
happiness
would
take
the
place
of
misery
plenty
would
change
places
with
want
and
all
the
world
rejoice
in
the
unending
millennium
with
my
mind
full
of
such
reflections
i
felt
humbled
in
my
own
estimation
and
dropped
on
my
knees
and
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
prayed
aloud
to
god
for
help
in
this
hour
of
great
trouble
i
prayed
long
and
fervently
and
whether
god
answered
that
prayer
or
not
i
shall
not
undertake
to
say
just
now
but
leave
my
kind
friends
to
determine
that
for
themselves
after
my
little
story
is
ended
it
was
some
time
after
dark
when
i
returned
to
the
house
and
found
supper
waiting
for
me
but
i
declined
to
eat
any
i
excused
myself
and
requested
to
be
shown
to
a
private
room
a
bed
stood
in
one
corner
a
bureau
and
two
chairs
constituted
the
furniture
there
were
two
windows
one
in
the
east
side
the
other
in
the
south
both
covered
with
clean
curtains
nicely
looped
up
from
the
middle
a
sat
on
a
tree
near
the
south
window
and
seemed
to
be
exerting
himself
to
amuse
me
i
like
but
this
one
was
hoarse
and
singing
out
of
tune
a
half
dozen
cats
were
holding
a
meeting
on
top
of
the
i
might
have
enjoyed
the
concert
under
more
favorable
circumstances
but
the
state
of
my
nervous
system
was
such
as
to
deprive
me
of
the
pleasure
i
needed
sleep
and
knew
that
it
was
my
duty
to
endeavor
to
get
it
so
as
to
enable
me
to
master
the
situation
in
which
i
was
placed
the
events
that
were
to
transpire
on
the
next
day
were
fraught
with
no
little
significance
so
far
as
they
might
result
to
myself
i
threw
off
my
clothes
and
stretched
myself
on
the
bed
first
extinguishing
the
light
and
tried
to
keep
my
thoughts
away
from
the
cat
show
but
that
was
a
failure
i
stood
it
as
long
as
any
man
could
have
done
and
would
have
submitted
to
the
torture
perhaps
longer
but
for
my
nervousness
i
threw
a
glass
tumbler
with
unerring
precision
one
cat
went
to
his
long
home
and
the
concert
closed
but
alas
i
soon
made
the
discovery
that
i
had
jumped
out
of
the
into
the
fire
the
caterwauling
melody
was
sweet
music
compared
with
the
noise
made
by
the
frogs
in
a
pond
hard
by
i
am
willing
to
admit
that
i
had
always
been
of
the
opinion
that
a
congregation
of
cats
could
make
the
most
noise
that
ever
was
heard
but
that
night
i
had
cause
to
change
my
opinion
i
award
the
premium
to
the
frog
he
can
beat
a
cat
to
death
and
give
him
an
hour
s
start
a
cat
has
to
stop
occasionally
to
fill
his
lungs
but
not
so
with
the
frog
he
seems
to
be
all
the
time
full
of
wind
at
all
events
no
man
ever
heard
a
frog
stop
for
breath
when
once
he
made
up
his
mind
not
to
do
it
the
frog
pond
was
not
more
than
fifty
yards
from
my
window
i
don
t
know
exactly
how
many
there
were
in
that
pond
though
it
must
have
been
very
densely
populated
judging
from
the
great
noise
they
made
if
frogs
were
worth
a
dollar
a
head
i
am
confident
that
there
were
enough
in
that
pond
to
pay
the
national
debt
not
counting
the
old
ones
that
had
retired
from
business
i
lay
and
listened
to
the
frogs
until
my
eyes
began
to
feel
heavy
and
just
as
i
was
about
to
fall
asleep
in
spite
of
the
frog
convention
a
mosquito
concluded
to
make
his
supper
off
of
my
nose
sometimes
i
would
actually
get
into
a
comfortable
doze
when
he
would
light
and
begin
to
put
his
pumps
to
work
and
wake
me
i
would
drive
him
away
but
he
would
not
take
the
hint
in
order
to
get
rid
of
him
i
offered
a
fair
compromise
i
was
willing
that
he
might
pump
as
much
blood
out
of
my
feet
as
he
could
chamber
and
taking
them
from
under
the
cover
i
held
them
out
to
him
but
he
rejected
my
liberal
offer
with
scorn
and
seemed
to
have
made
up
his
mind
to
fight
it
out
on
the
nose
line
the
result
was
after
a
half
hour
s
contest
i
killed
him
and
then
i
soon
fell
asleep
it
was
but
natural
to
suppose
that
my
slumbers
would
be
disturbed
by
unpleasant
dreams
how
could
anything
else
be
expected
harassed
as
my
mind
was
with
such
unpleasant
reflections
i
dreamed
of
war
blood
duels
and
a
thousand
other
things
too
tedious
to
mention
but
i
must
tell
you
of
two
of
my
dreams
i
first
fancied
that
i
was
a
young
tadpole
swimming
about
in
the
pond
among
the
frogs
i
was
very
proud
of
my
beautiful
tail
and
imagined
that
all
the
frogs
were
dying
with
envy
because
they
had
lost
theirs
it
never
had
occurred
to
me
that
at
no
distant
day
i
should
lose
my
tail
and
be
reduced
to
an
equality
with
the
frogs
i
was
dashing
about
among
the
frogs
and
switching
my
tail
in
their
faces
in
a
very
rude
manner
the
fact
is
i
was
tantalizing
them
for
being
out
of
fashion
i
had
the
misfortune
to
incur
the
displeasure
of
a
celebrated
frog
who
was
famous
for
his
courage
and
who
possessed
an
ungovernable
temper
i
trust
that
my
friends
will
not
be
disposed
to
censure
me
for
describing
such
a
ridiculous
dream
but
i
am
telling
exactly
what
did
occur
and
not
what
ought
to
have
occurred
in
the
first
place
it
will
be
well
to
remember
the
circumstances
by
which
i
was
surrounded
i
was
about
to
be
forced
into
a
duel
with
a
man
against
whom
i
bore
no
and
whom
i
was
determined
not
to
hurt
then
i
was
full
of
perplexity
because
i
did
not
know
the
cause
which
had
induced
him
to
challenge
me
while
my
mind
was
completely
unsettled
by
these
unpleasant
reflections
i
was
trying
to
steal
a
little
sleep
in
order
that
i
might
be
in
a
condition
to
wrestle
with
the
situation
on
the
next
day
then
it
was
a
natural
consequence
that
i
should
dream
of
duels
and
frogs
especially
when
it
is
remembered
that
the
cats
and
frogs
had
conspired
to
keep
me
awake
and
when
in
spite
of
them
i
did
fall
asleep
but
let
me
go
on
with
my
strange
dream
when
i
had
been
so
inconsiderate
as
to
flirt
my
tail
against
the
nose
of
the
frog
i
discovered
when
it
was
too
late
that
i
had
involved
myself
in
a
serious
difficulty
and
hoping
to
escape
the
consequences
i
sought
refuge
behind
an
old
rotten
log
that
lay
in
the
edge
of
the
pond
i
was
very
much
alarmed
when
i
saw
a
large
number
of
frogs
collecting
round
the
one
whose
nose
i
had
so
imprudently
slapped
with
my
tail
a
little
timid
tadpole
swam
up
close
to
me
and
very
meekly
informed
me
that
i
was
in
great
danger
as
i
had
insulted
the
most
important
frog
in
the
pond
i
was
very
much
disturbed
by
this
information
and
was
preparing
an
apology
to
be
sent
when
i
received
a
message
from
the
insulted
frog
to
the
best
of
my
recollection
it
was
in
substance
as
follows
general
frog
presents
his
compliments
to
colonel
tadpole
and
begs
to
say
that
while
bathing
in
his
own
precinct
a
gross
insult
was
offered
him
by
colonel
tadpole
who
wantonly
flirted
his
tail
in
general
frog
s
face
general
frog
therefore
has
the
honor
to
request
colonel
tadpole
to
designate
a
time
and
place
when
and
where
such
satisfaction
can
be
had
as
is
recognized
by
the
code
general
frog
designates
the
bearer
of
this
message
as
his
friend
who
is
authorized
to
arrange
i
am
free
to
confess
that
i
was
completely
paralyzed
with
fear
when
i
received
this
message
and
would
have
made
an
honorable
apology
but
the
bearer
refused
to
listen
to
reason
he
demanded
blood
and
swore
that
if
i
refused
to
fight
i
was
a
dead
tadpole
certain
i
was
about
to
faint
from
sheer
cowardice
when
a
bold
young
tadpole
whispered
in
my
ear
put
on
a
bold
front
said
he
general
frog
is
a
humbug
and
a
bully
accept
his
challenge
make
him
fight
with
sticks
six
inches
long
and
a
half
inch
in
diameter
let
the
sticks
be
sharpened
at
one
end
a
frog
always
has
his
mouth
open
and
you
can
run
your
stick
down
his
throat
and
kill
him
while
he
is
trying
to
get
a
fair
lick
at
your
i
acted
on
this
advice
and
being
the
challenged
party
had
the
right
to
choose
the
weapon
quite
a
commotion
was
caused
when
it
became
known
that
a
duel
was
to
be
fought
between
general
frog
and
colonel
tadpole
the
weapons
were
prepared
the
space
in
the
water
was
measured
and
ominous
silence
pervaded
the
pond
a
thing
that
had
never
happened
before
we
were
placed
eighteen
inches
apart
and
when
we
were
ordered
to
take
our
places
i
could
see
plainly
that
public
sentiment
was
against
me
among
the
frogs
but
every
tadpole
in
the
pond
was
on
my
side
when
the
word
was
given
i
made
a
dash
forward
and
plunged
my
stick
down
general
frog
s
throat
taking
him
completely
by
surprise
the
general
s
friends
carried
him
off
the
field
but
he
was
a
dead
frog
and
when
it
was
announced
that
the
great
general
frog
was
dead
such
a
wail
as
rent
the
air
then
never
had
been
heard
in
the
frog
kingdom
before
the
unusual
noise
awoke
me
and
i
was
glad
to
find
it
was
all
a
dream
and
that
i
was
not
really
a
tadpole
i
got
up
lighted
the
candle
kissed
lottie
s
picture
a
dozen
times
looked
at
my
watch
and
found
that
i
had
only
slept
an
hour
after
pacing
the
floor
for
half
an
hour
i
again
threw
myself
on
the
bed
and
soon
was
dreaming
again
while
the
second
dream
was
not
so
full
of
nonsense
as
the
first
one
it
was
pregnant
with
unpleasantness
it
was
what
i
call
a
dream
short
and
to
the
point
i
thought
wallingford
and
i
had
failed
to
reach
a
reconciliation
and
that
general
calloway
announced
to
me
that
i
must
fight
we
fought
with
pistols
at
ten
paces
and
i
was
killed
at
the
first
fire
i
suffered
all
the
agonies
of
death
and
as
soon
as
my
soul
left
the
body
his
satanic
majesty
stood
ready
to
take
me
into
custody
i
remember
exactly
how
he
looked
he
had
his
with
him
they
had
handcuffs
and
chains
to
fasten
my
limbs
they
took
me
down
through
a
long
space
of
exceeding
darkness
when
all
at
once
my
eyes
were
blinded
by
the
bright
flames
that
broke
on
my
view
i
started
up
and
awoke
and
saw
two
men
standing
over
me
while
one
held
a
candle
the
other
had
a
pair
of
handcuffs
in
his
hand
get
up
sir
and
put
on
your
clothes
as
soon
as
you
can
we
want
you
to
go
with
i
did
as
i
was
ordered
asking
no
questions
the
first
thing
that
occurred
to
me
was
that
the
civil
authority
had
ordered
my
arrest
so
as
to
prevent
the
duel
and
to
be
candid
i
was
very
glad
of
it
anything
to
prevent
the
duel
suited
me
for
i
hated
the
idea
of
being
shot
at
merely
to
gratify
a
foolish
whim
of
harry
wallingford
when
i
finished
my
toilet
one
of
the
men
locked
the
handcuffs
on
my
wrists
and
then
commanded
me
to
follow
them
under
any
other
circumstances
i
dare
say
i
should
have
knocked
a
man
down
who
attempted
to
manacle
me
but
i
was
willing
to
submit
to
any
indignity
and
endure
any
inconvenience
that
would
prevent
the
duel
i
followed
the
officers
submissively
and
silently
being
satisfied
that
my
imprisonment
would
be
only
temporary
i
would
be
set
at
liberty
as
soon
as
my
friends
could
arrange
to
make
a
bond
the
officers
put
me
in
a
buggy
and
began
to
drive
rapidly
toward
hernando
we
arrived
there
a
short
time
before
daybreak
when
i
was
placed
on
a
train
and
was
soon
moving
rapidly
toward
grenada
i
was
unable
to
account
for
this
why
should
i
be
carried
out
of
the
country
where
i
had
violated
the
law
a
suspicion
now
began
to
rise
in
my
mind
that
it
was
not
the
duel
which
had
caused
my
arrest
and
i
ventured
to
ask
one
of
the
officers
the
cause
of
it
instead
of
giving
me
a
civil
answer
he
broke
into
a
hoarse
laugh
ha
ha
ha
tom
just
listen
to
this
rascal
will
you
he
wants
to
know
the
cause
of
his
arrest
now
ain
t
that
brassy
see
here
old
fellow
said
the
other
officer
addressing
himself
to
me
that
s
too
thin
now
you
just
sit
down
there
and
keep
mighty
quiet
none
of
your
palaver
with
me
i
ve
had
much
to
do
with
your
sort
lately
they
always
play
am
i
arrested
for
attempting
to
fight
a
duel
i
ventured
to
inquire
for
what
did
you
say
demanded
the
officer
apparently
very
much
surprised
i
thought
i
was
arrested
for
attempting
to
fight
a
duel
i
replied
ha
ha
ha
tom
that
fellow
is
going
to
try
the
insane
dodge
but
look
here
old
fellow
that
game
s
played
out
your
cake
is
all
dough
you
are
gone
up
the
spout
this
time
certain
it
s
a
pity
though
to
hang
such
a
chap
as
you
but
i
reckon
it
ll
have
to
be
done
i
guess
you
won
t
get
another
chance
to
escape
they
ll
iron
you
down
good
this
my
ire
was
roused
as
well
as
my
curiosity
and
i
indignantly
demanded
to
know
the
cause
of
my
arrest
and
where
i
was
being
carried
come
sir
said
one
of
the
men
none
of
your
airs
here
now
if
you
know
what
s
good
for
you
i
guess
you
ll
keep
your
mouth
shut
unless
you
can
talk
with
a
little
more
i
leaned
back
in
my
seat
and
tried
to
collect
my
scattered
thoughts
but
i
was
so
confused
that
i
scarcely
could
tell
whether
i
was
dreaming
or
not
it
was
very
plain
however
that
the
duel
had
nothing
to
do
with
my
arrest
but
what
was
the
cause
was
the
question
now
to
be
settled
they
spoke
of
hanging
what
on
earth
could
it
mean
they
talked
about
escapes
and
irons
etc
what
had
i
to
do
with
all
this
the
train
rattled
on
the
lamp
cast
a
faint
light
through
the
coach
as
the
gray
streaks
of
dawn
began
to
steal
through
the
windows
one
officer
coiled
himself
up
on
a
seat
just
in
front
of
me
and
began
to
snore
so
loud
that
it
could
be
heard
above
the
rattle
of
the
train
the
other
one
sat
by
my
side
with
a
navy
six
in
his
belt
keeping
guard
while
his
companion
slept
every
now
and
then
he
took
a
drink
of
whisky
from
a
flask
which
he
carried
in
his
pocket
the
train
did
not
stop
until
we
reached
grenada
i
was
then
directed
to
follow
the
officers
to
the
hotel
for
breakfast
i
drank
a
cup
of
coffee
but
could
not
eat
my
head
was
aching
as
if
it
would
burst
and
i
had
a
burning
fever
we
waited
at
grenada
two
hours
when
the
train
on
the
mississippi
central
railroad
arrived
i
was
conducted
aboard
and
again
found
myself
flying
on
at
the
rate
of
fifty
miles
an
hour
it
was
late
in
the
evening
when
i
was
taken
off
the
train
at
a
small
wayside
station
and
conducted
to
a
that
was
ready
to
start
toward
the
east
myself
and
the
two
officers
were
the
only
passengers
the
driver
popped
his
whip
and
we
began
to
move
on
where
am
i
going
and
what
is
to
be
my
fate
was
my
mental
question
what
will
general
galloway
think
of
me
when
i
fail
to
make
my
appearance
at
horn
lake
he
will
think
i
have
fled
from
mere
cowardice
what
will
lottie
think
when
they
tell
her
that
i
have
sneaked
off
and
hidden
myself
to
avoid
a
fight
my
letter
will
be
handed
to
her
at
eight
o
clock
this
evening
and
they
will
tell
her
that
i
have
run
away
my
mental
sufferings
were
very
great
while
my
physical
torture
continued
to
increase
the
fever
was
burning
me
with
excessive
violence
and
i
knew
that
i
was
going
to
be
seriously
my
companions
were
both
in
a
beastly
state
of
intoxication
one
of
them
stretched
on
the
floor
of
the
coach
while
the
other
nodded
and
snored
by
my
side
the
driver
was
so
drunk
that
he
could
scarcely
keep
his
seat
and
when
i
begged
him
to
stop
and
get
me
a
drink
of
water
he
replied
with
an
oath
that
he
had
no
time
to
fool
the
road
was
rough
and
hilly
and
the
horses
would
go
up
the
rise
at
a
snail
gallop
and
then
go
down
at
full
speed
jolting
and
tossing
me
about
like
a
my
sufferings
were
indescribable
it
was
after
midnight
when
the
coach
halted
in
front
of
a
large
brick
building
in
the
village
of
p
and
i
was
ordered
to
get
out
i
made
an
effort
to
obey
but
was
so
ill
that
i
could
not
rise
from
my
seat
you
will
have
to
assist
me
gentlemen
said
i
for
i
am
very
none
of
your
shamming
now
growled
one
of
the
drunken
brutes
that
s
too
thin
it
s
too
soon
to
begin
that
game
out
with
you
and
be
quick
about
it
too
i
am
really
very
ill
sir
and
without
help
i
am
not
able
to
stand
come
along
with
you
then
i
believe
you
are
trying
to
play
the
same
old
dodge
but
we
ll
fix
you
this
time
so
you
won
t
get
as
he
muttered
these
words
he
dragged
me
from
the
coach
and
led
me
into
the
house
which
proved
to
be
the
county
jail
they
carried
me
up
a
pair
of
stairs
and
placed
me
in
a
dungeon
closed
the
door
and
left
me
in
total
darkness
i
sank
down
on
the
floor
completely
exhausted
and
almost
crazed
with
misery
the
blood
in
my
veins
seemed
to
be
boiling
hot
while
the
fever
continued
to
increase
my
stomach
felt
as
if
it
were
on
fire
and
i
was
nearly
famished
for
water
i
began
to
crawl
about
the
floor
hoping
to
find
water
for
i
had
called
as
loud
as
i
could
several
times
begging
for
some
to
be
brought
but
no
one
had
answered
my
cries
after
searching
about
in
the
dark
for
some
time
i
found
a
stone
jug
of
water
that
was
very
warm
but
it
was
better
than
none
during
the
search
for
the
water
i
found
a
little
bundle
of
straw
in
one
corner
of
the
room
with
a
blanket
spread
over
it
throwing
myself
down
on
it
i
groaned
in
despair
no
mental
torture
could
be
greater
than
i
suffered
then
the
mysterious
manner
of
my
arrest
the
knowledge
that
i
was
on
the
eve
of
a
dangerous
spell
of
fever
the
disgrace
that
would
attach
to
my
name
the
opinion
that
general
calloway
would
have
of
me
the
sorrow
that
would
fall
on
my
darling
lottie
all
combined
to
drive
me
down
to
the
lowest
depths
of
despair
while
all
this
mental
anguish
was
conspiring
to
drive
me
mad
the
burning
fever
was
scorching
and
parching
my
blood
i
well
knew
from
the
symptoms
that
i
was
seriously
threatened
with
brain
fever
i
rolled
and
tossed
myself
about
on
the
straw
until
i
felt
my
brain
grow
dizzy
my
mind
commenced
to
wander
i
cried
aloud
for
help
but
none
came
with
lottie
s
sweet
name
on
my
lips
her
picture
in
my
hand
i
fell
into
a
state
of
unconsciousness
when
i
regained
consciousness
i
was
a
mere
skeleton
unable
to
lift
my
head
from
my
pillow
and
it
was
a
long
time
after
my
reason
returned
before
i
could
remember
where
i
was
or
what
had
happened
a
little
negro
boy
came
to
the
door
and
shoved
a
dish
of
provisions
through
the
bars
of
iron
then
placed
a
pitcher
of
water
where
i
could
reach
it
and
was
turning
away
when
i
called
to
him
in
a
voice
so
feeble
that
i
was
astonished
at
the
sound
of
it
he
heard
me
however
and
returned
to
the
door
and
inquired
what
i
wanted
how
long
have
i
been
here
i
whispered
you

i
spect
when
ye
gits
better
you
ll
member
all
bout
then
he
went
away
whistling
dixie
doubtless
believing
me
still
out
of
my
senses
and
to
tell
the
truth
i
was
inclined
to
that
opinion
myself
it
seemed
to
me
to
be
absolutely
certain
that
i
had
either
gone
raving
mad
myself
or
that
i
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
a
gang
of
maniacs
but
the
most
plausible
argument
was
in
favor
of
the
idea
that
my
mind
was
wandering
my
disease
had
run
its
course
and
i
was
free
from
physical
sufferings
except
excessive
weakness
and
a
general
prostration
all
the
hair
had
been
shaved
from
my
head
and
my
temples
had
been
scarified
all
over
the
room
or
dungeon
in
which
i
was
confined
was
quite
small
not
over
ten
feet
square
all
the
light
and
air
came
through
a
small
square
grated
window
about
twelve
inches
wide
however
during
the
the
wooden
shutter
of
the
door
was
left
open
which
served
to
aid
in
ventilating
the
room
but
at
night
it
was
closed
heavy
iron
bars
crossed
each
other
thickly
in
the
door
and
a
small
space
was
open
near
the
floor
through
which
the
little
negro
usually
passed
the
dishes
that
contained
my
food
a
short
while
after
the
negro
boy
had
left
me
a
man
came
and
unlocked
the
door
and
entered
the
dungeon
carefully
closing
it
when
he
had
got
inside
well
old
fellow
said
the
visitor
as
he
took
a
seat
near
me
and
felt
my
pulse
how
do
you
come
on
this
morning
better
i
think
was
my
reply
though
i
hardly
know
the
nature
of
my
disease
one
thing
is
plain
i
am
quite
feeble
my
strength
is
all
ah
yes
no
doubt
you
feel
very
weak
quite
natural
you
should
after
such
an
attack
of
brain
fever
i
thought
you
were
going
to
make
a
die
of
it
in
spite
of
my
humble
efforts
to
save
you
but
thanks
to
a
vigorous
constitution
which
you
very
fortunately
possessed
i
have
been
able
to
pull
you
through
you
will
be
all
right
again
in
a
few
days
i
have
ordered
you
some
beef
tea
which
you
must
use
freely
and
by
i
dare
say
you
will
be
able
to
take
more
solid
food
let
me
look
at
your
tongue
ah
that
s
all
right
you
won
t
leave
us
yet
a
doctor
said
i
will
you
be
so
kind
as
to
inform
me
if
you
know
why
i
am
imprisoned
in
this
horrible
dungeon
come
come
my
dear
fellow
you
had
better
not
talk
about
that
unpleasant
affair
until
you
get
more
strength
by
no
means
let
your
mind
run
on
that
subject
by
the
by
debar
what
lady
is
this
you
have
been
raving
about
all
the
time
lottie
lottie
yes
i
think
that
was
the
name
if
you
called
her
name
once
you
called
it
fifty
thousand
times
within
the
last
three
weeks
the
fact
is
you
talked
as
if
she
were
present
with
you
all
the
she
is
a
charming
girl
who
resides
in
memphis
tennessee
and
my
betrothed
ha
ha
i
say
your
betrothed
bride
but
come
come
debar
you
had
better
keep
quiet
i
reckon
for
i
see
your
mind
is
not
exactly
right
why
do
you
call
me
debar
that
is
not
my
name
i
am
a
physician
by
profession
my
name
is
edward
demar
and
i
never
saw
this
jail
until
the
night
i
came
here
three
weeks
pshaw
debar
i
had
been
hoping
that
your
mind
was
entirely
restored
but
i
am
sorry
to
find
myself
disappointed
in
that
hope
is
this
the
picture
of
the
young
lady
you
call
lottie
she
must
be
exceedingly
beautiful
indeed
that
is
the
sweetest
face
i
ever
saw
you
have
been
holding
that
picture
in
your
hand
and
kissing
it
frequently
while
your
reason
was
partially
if
not
totally
oh
sir
if
you
knew
how
i
worship
that
dear
girl
you
would
not
be
surprised
at
my
devotion
to
her
picture
i
don
t
think
your
wife
would
like
to
hear
you
talk
that
what
in
heaven
s
name
do
you
mean
i
have
no
wife
nor
ever
look
here
debar
you
are
either
out
of
your
senses
or
shamming
for
i
know
a
lady
who
loves
you
devotedly
and
she
is
your
wife
too
and
a
very
true
worthy
one
at
that
a
thousand
times
too
good
for
such
a
scapegrace
as
i
tell
you
my
name
is
not
debar
and
i
swear
i
have
not
been
married
i
never
loved
but
one
woman
in
my
life
and
that
is
lottie
wallingford
of
ha
ha
ha
now
this
is
really
interesting
indeed
it
is
you
don
t
know
your
own
name
can
t
remember
your
pretty
wife
never
was
here
before
ha
ha
ha
well
well
well
i
have
often
known
criminals
to
try
the
insane
dodge
but
i
never
knew
one
to
deny
his
own
name
and
repudiate
his
own
wife
before
but
old
fellow
i
am
to
blame
for
letting
you
talk
so
much
anyway
you
just
keep
very
quiet
and
drink
as
much
of
the
beef
tea
as
you
can
i
will
call
again
in
the
morning
by
that
time
i
guess
you
will
remember
your
name
and
i
ll
send
a
messenger
after
your
wife
as
i
have
been
told
she
has
got
back
home
she
has
been
absent
a
long
time
that
is
the
reason
she
has
not
called
to
see
you
i
suppose
doctor
lamberton
was
quite
a
young
man
and
from
our
short
acquaintance
i
had
formed
rather
a
favorable
opinion
of
him
he
was
very
kind
to
me
and
i
learned
that
he
had
been
unremitting
in
his
attentions
to
me
during
my
long
and
serious
illness
doubtless
i
would
have
died
but
for
his
kindness
when
i
was
left
alone
my
thoughts
went
to
work
more
vigorously
than
they
ever
had
done
before
chapter
xxiv
after
doctor
lamberton
departed
i
closed
my
eyes
and
tried
to
sum
up
in
my
mind
all
that
had
occurred
since
i
left
memphis
in
order
to
see
if
i
could
make
anything
tangible
out
of
it
the
hours
dragged
slowly
along
a
faint
light
struggled
through
the
small
aperture
misnamed
window
a
little
mouse
stole
in
and
began
to
nibble
at
the
crumbs
of
bread
on
the
floor
while
i
watched
him
intently
it
was
a
relief
to
me
to
see
any
living
thing
no
matter
what
it
was
it
had
the
effect
of
keeping
my
mind
from
painful
subjects
when
the
little
mouse
would
finish
his
repast
and
leave
me
alone
i
would
lie
on
my
filthy
straw
bed
and
watch
his
hole
for
hours
at
a
time
hoping
he
would
come
again
to
keep
me
company
a
large
spider
had
set
his
net
in
one
corner
of
the
window
in
order
to
capture
unsuspecting
flies
that
were
constantly
coming
in
and
out
through
the
opening
his
net
was
an
ingenious
piece
of
workmanship
and
it
took
him
several
days
to
finish
it
he
could
throw
his
thread
with
as
much
accuracy
as
a
mexican
greaser
could
throw
his
lariat
after
he
had
completed
his
net
he
built
a
little
neat
residence
for
himself
near
it
so
he
could
sit
and
look
through
his
window
and
watch
his
trap
i
noticed
that
in
selecting
the
location
for
his
residence
he
was
very
particular
to
place
it
so
that
it
would
not
be
seen
by
any
insect
coming
in
through
the
window
he
erected
his
apartments
inside
and
a
little
in
the
rear
of
the
corner
of
the
while
his
net
was
stretched
across
it
the
web
was
woven
so
very
fine
that
it
was
scarcely
visible
to
the
naked
eye
and
many
a
bold
fly
lost
his
life
by
being
caught
in
its
meshes
sometimes
a
vigorous
contest
would
take
place
when
a
fly
would
make
a
desperate
struggle
to
free
himself
but
i
noticed
that
the
victim
seldom
came
off
victorious
one
memorable
battle
between
the
spider
and
a
large
bumblebee
i
think
worthy
to
be
described
as
soon
as
the
bumblebee
got
one
of
his
legs
entangled
in
the
net
he
commenced
to
work
vigorously
to
loosen
it
the
spider
came
out
and
took
up
his
position
within
two
inches
of
the
captive
and
began
to
throw
his
lariat
at
his
leg
the
heroic
efforts
of
the
bumblebee
excited
my
sympathy
and
i
would
have
gone
to
his
rescue
if
i
had
been
able
but
i
was
helpless
i
could
only
lie
still
and
give
him
my
good
wishes
after
a
while
the
spider
managed
to
get
one
leg
of
his
intended
victim
securely
fastened
and
i
was
sorry
to
think
that
the
poor
bumblebee
s
fate
was
to
be
death
but
not
so
i
was
struck
with
admiration
when
i
saw
the
brave
fellow
amputating
his
own
leg
by
using
his
teeth
the
spider
however
seemed
to
realize
the
situation
for
while
the
bumblebee
was
engaged
in
amputating
the
leg
he
began
to
hurl
his
lariat
at
another
and
by
the
time
the
amputation
was
done
one
more
limb
was
tied
fast
but
the
bumblebee
seemed
determined
to
regain
his
liberty
at
any
cost
so
he
fell
to
and
took
off
the
other
leg
and
did
it
so
quickly
that
the
spider
did
not
have
time
to
fasten
another
and
the
gallant
hero
was
free
minus
two
of
his
legs
as
soon
as
the
bumblebee
regained
his
liberty
instead
of
retreating
as
i
expected
he
would
do
he
quietly
seated
himself
on
the
and
watched
the
spider
s
hall
as
if
he
were
not
satisfied
with
the
result
of
the
fight
after
a
while
however
he
disappeared
and
i
let
my
sympathies
go
with
him
the
spider
s
net
was
completely
destroyed
and
i
was
glad
of
it
but
he
set
about
rebuilding
it
which
cost
him
three
days
incessant
labor
the
little
mouse
the
spider
and
dear
lottie
s
picture
were
my
only
companions
during
the
long
lonesome
days
of
my
captivity
i
would
lie
on
my
back
for
many
hours
at
a
time
with
my
eyes
riveted
on
lottie
s
picture
and
ask
myself
a
thousand
questions
what
is
lottie
doing
at
this
moment
i
wonder
if
she
is
thinking
of
me
have
they
made
her
believe
that
i
ran
away
of
my
own
accord
perhaps
they
have
persuaded
her
to
give
me
up
as
one
unworthy
of
her
love
maybe
they
have
induced
her
to
marry
heartsell
heaven
have
mercy
on
me
i
groaned
in
despair
if
i
had
known
then
what
was
going
on
at
home
i
dare
say
my
anguish
would
have
been
greater
still
but
i
presume
it
was
better
as
it
was
for
i
might
have
died
if
any
additional
troubles
had
been
thrust
upon
me
i
think
that
the
heroic
struggle
i
had
witnessed
on
the
part
of
the
gallant
bumblebee
to
win
his
freedom
had
a
good
effect
on
me
i
became
convinced
that
a
man
of
courage
and
strength
could
accomplish
anything
that
was
necessary
and
i
then
and
there
resolved
that
i
would
imitate
the
brave
example
set
by
the
heroic
insect
as
soon
as
i
recuperated
my
strength
i
would
make
an
effort
to
regain
my
liberty
an
effort
that
should
break
down
and
trample
over
all
opposition
i
would
not
yield
like
a
base
coward
but
would
be
free
or
lose
my
life
in
the
attempt
to
accomplish
that
end
it
was
four
days
after
i
had
regained
consciousness
before
i
was
able
to
sit
up
in
my
bed
doctor
lamberton
visited
me
once
a
day
usually
coming
early
in
the
morning
and
chatted
with
me
a
few
moments
gave
his
instructions
and
retired
then
i
would
be
left
alone
for
the
remainder
of
the
day
except
when
some
one
would
come
to
bring
me
food
and
drink
then
i
would
divide
my
time
between
the
mouse
the
spider
and
lottie
s
picture
giving
most
of
my
attention
though
to
the
image
of
my
darling
it
was
so
dark
in
my
cell
that
i
could
not
read
even
if
i
had
had
anything
in
the
shape
of
a
book
and
then
since
the
fever
had
left
my
brain
it
seemed
to
be
lingering
in
my
eyes
and
made
them
sore
and
quite
sensitive
the
doctor
brought
me
a
pair
of
green
glasses
to
protect
my
eyes
and
told
me
to
wear
them
all
the
time
as
my
eyes
were
in
very
great
danger
my
recovery
was
exceedingly
slow
as
soon
as
i
thought
my
strength
would
justify
it
i
wrote
a
long
letter
to
lottie
giving
in
detail
all
the
circumstance
that
had
combined
to
prevent
my
return
to
memphis
i
requested
her
to
see
doctor
dodson
inform
him
of
my
situation
and
ask
him
to
come
to
my
assistance
without
a
moment
s
delay
i
also
requested
her
to
go
and
see
general
calloway
and
explain
to
him
the
cause
of
my
absence
from
horn
lake
on
the
day
appointed
i
informed
her
of
my
illness
but
did
not
tell
her
how
serious
it
had
been
i
told
her
the
simple
truth
when
i
said
that
her
dear
picture
had
been
my
chief
source
of
happiness
during
the
long
weary
days
of
my
solitary
confinement
my
letter
closed
thus
always
trust
me
dear
lottie
no
matter
what
you
hear
about
me
i
am
now
have
ever
been
and
always
will
be
as
true
to
you
as
the
needle
is
to
the
i
sealed
and
delivered
that
letter
to
the
negro
boy
who
promised
to
mail
it
but
i
don
t
think
he
did
it
for
no
such
letter
ever
was
received
by
lottie
i
waited
and
hoped
for
doctor
dodson
to
come
to
my
assistance
but
alas
i
waited
and
hoped
in
vain
as
soon
as
i
was
able
to
take
a
little
exercise
by
walking
about
the
room
that
small
comfort
was
denied
me
for
a
rough
blacksmith
came
in
one
day
and
riveted
a
heavy
chain
on
my
ankle
then
fastened
the
other
end
to
a
beam
in
the
floor
there
now
he
exclaimed
when
he
had
finished
the
job
i
guess
that
ll
keep
you
this
time
by
the
way
debar
how
did
you
manage
to
get
those
tools
what
tools
are
you
talking
about
why
of
course
the
tools
you
used
in
cutting
out
when
you
were
in
here
i
never
was
here
before
and
my
name
is
not
debar
oh
ah
i
see
how
it
is
the
insane
dodge
this
time
but
look
here
old
fel
that
s
too
thin
i
should
advise
you
to
invent
something
i
was
glad
when
the
uncouth
blacksmith
took
his
leave
but
sorry
to
know
that
he
would
make
another
witness
to
identify
me
as
the
real
debar
one
morning
while
i
was
endeavoring
to
amuse
myself
by
watching
the
strange
maneuvers
of
the
spider
as
he
was
weaving
a
new
wing
to
his
net
the
jailer
made
his
appearance
at
the
door
and
began
to
unlock
the
inner
shutter
he
was
a
rough
drunken
brute
who
scarcely
ever
came
about
me
and
when
he
did
he
refused
to
answer
any
of
my
questions
i
learned
afterward
that
the
rough
treatment
i
had
been
subjected
to
was
owing
to
the
fact
that
he
thought
me
the
man
who
had
made
the
escape
some
time
previous
when
he
had
finished
unlocking
the
door
a
lady
came
rushing
into
the
room
and
threw
her
arms
round
my
neck
exclaiming
as
she
burst
into
tears
oh
eddie
why
did
you
let
them
catch
you
again
i
thought
you
were
safe
in
mexico
by
this
time
the
jailer
had
immediately
slammed
the
door
to
and
locked
it
leaving
us
alone
i
was
paralyzed
with
astonishment
and
unable
to
utter
a
word
for
several
seconds
as
soon
however
as
i
recovered
my
i
pushed
her
away
rather
roughly
madame
i
exclaimed
indignantly
you
are
laboring
under
a
grave
mistake
i
am
not
your
husband
have
not
been
married
and
i
never
saw
you
in
my
life
until
this
moment
she
drew
back
gazed
at
me
for
a
moment
in
a
bewildered
way
then
uttering
a
most
pitiful
wail
fell
fainting
on
the
floor
i
threw
some
water
in
her
face
and
did
all
i
could
to
revive
her
and
was
gratified
to
see
signs
of
recovery
she
was
a
very
beautiful
woman
though
her
face
was
quite
pale
her
long
black
hair
came
loose
and
fell
in
great
masses
on
the
floor
directly
she
was
able
to
rise
and
i
saw
that
she
was
very
much
embarrassed
she
again
fixed
her
eye
intently
on
me
and
appeared
to
be
undecided
as
to
what
should
be
said
i
hope
you
will
pardon
me
sir
but
you
are
very
like
my
husband
and
then
they
told
me
that
he
was
and
in
this
room
i
should
have
known
you
were
not
my
husband
if
i
had
met
you
in
the
light
but
when
i
entered
this
dark
cell
i
could
scarcely
see
my
hand
before
me
i
declare
i
never
have
seen
two
persons
so
much
alike
though
you
are
a
little
taller
than
he
i
think
and
there
is
a
difference
in
the
voice
and
perhaps
a
slight
difference
in
the
color
of
the
hair
yours
being
a
shade
darker
than
my
husband
s
i
am
truly
sorry
sir
to
know
that
you
have
been
compelled
to
suffer
so
for
a
crime
you
did
not
commit
but
i
rejoice
to
find
that
my
dear
husband
has
not
been
retaken
he
is
innocent
but
was
unable
to
prove
his
innocence
public
sentiment
ran
high
against
him
and
he
was
forced
to
save
his
life
by
my
dear
madame
said
i
you
will
not
hesitate
a
moment
i
hope
in
informing
the
sheriff
that
he
is
holding
the
wrong
man
in
custody
i
have
suffered
indescribable
torture
since
my
detention
here
and
i
fear
that
serious
consequences
have
resulted
from
my
indeed
sir
you
shall
not
remain
here
another
day
if
anything
i
can
say
or
do
will
secure
your
release
i
will
go
immediately
to
the
proper
officers
and
tell
them
of
the
great
mistake
they
have
she
then
called
the
jailer
and
requested
to
be
allowed
to
come
stop
a
moment
demar
said
peniwinkle
rising
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
and
bowing
low
before
him
and
queen
mary
i
can
not
wait
any
longer
i
most
humbly
beg
your
pardon
for
the
indignity
that
we
have
unwittingly
offered
you
we
have
been
following
you
for
the
last
ten
days
believing
you
to
be
edward
debar
but
i
now
see
what
an
unfortunate
mistake
we
have
made
while
we
have
been
watching
you
we
have
let
the
real
criminal
get
away
we
had
traced
debar
to
memphis
and
found
where
he
had
his
wife
concealed
and
have
been
thrown
off
his
track
by
the
great
resemblance
you
bear
to
him
indeed
the
resemblance
must
be
very
striking
to
have
misled
us
so
we
have
committed
a
most
unlucky
blunder
and
have
lost
our
reward
the
real
criminal
has
escaped
and
we
have
been
so
unfortunate
as
to
offer
you
an
unpardonable
not
at
all
peniwinkle
ingomar
replied
you
only
did
what
you
considered
right
you
thought
you
were
performing
your
duty
as
an
officer
and
i
rather
feel
inclined
to
applaud
instead
of
censuring
you
it
seems
that
other
officers
have
fallen
into
the
same
error
be
seated
peniwinkle
and
let
the
matter
drop
i
would
most
willingly
grant
pardon
but
where
no
wrong
has
been
committed
of
course
there
is
nothing
to
peniwinkle
resumed
his
seat
and
ingomar
went
on
with
his
story
i
must
now
tell
you
what
was
transpiring
at
memphis
while
i
was
in
jail
all
of
which
was
afterward
related
to
me
by
general
calloway
was
at
horn
lake
very
early
on
the
morning
that
i
had
promised
to
meet
him
there
so
were
harry
and
his
friend
heartsell
ten
o
clock
the
hour
when
we
had
all
agreed
to
meet
arrived
and
every
one
was
at
his
post
but
me
after
waiting
for
me
until
eleven
o
clock
harry
became
impatient
and
intimated
to
heartsell
that
it
was
his
opinion
that
i
had
fled
yes
replied
heartsell
and
i
ll
bet
my
last
cent
he
has
carried
that
woman
off
with
let
him
go
and
welcome
said
harry
but
i
should
have
been
glad
to
have
had
one
shot
at
the
villain
s
carcass
before
he
general
calloway
made
inquiries
of
all
the
citizens
of
the
little
village
hoping
to
hear
from
me
but
no
one
had
seen
me
i
of
course
had
managed
to
get
out
of
the
village
quietly
without
being
noticed
by
any
of
the
residents
as
that
was
in
accordance
with
general
calloway
s
instructions
and
i
suppose
that
the
two
officers
who
had
arrested
me
had
not
told
any
one
their
business
hence
i
had
been
carried
off
without
any
one
knowing
anything
about
it
when
twelve
o
clock
came
and
still
no
tidings
of
my
whereabouts
had
been
obtained
general
calloway
became
restless
and
suspicious
heartsell
approached
the
general
and
said
i
suppose
it
is
unnecessary
for
us
to
wait
here
any
longer
the
time
agreed
on
has
passed
by
two
hours
ago
i
think
your
friend
demar
has
concluded
that
discretion
is
the
better
part
of
valor
in
plain
terms
i
think
he
has
run
i
can
not
believe
he
has
done
such
a
cowardly
act
as
that
replied
general
calloway
some
serious
accident
i
fear
has
happened
to
him
he
took
the
freight
train
at
memphis
and
he
may
have
got
hurt
on
the
railroad
it
is
my
duty
to
have
this
matter
thoroughly
investigated
and
i
mean
to
do
it
i
have
always
believed
demar
to
be
a
brave
honorable
young
man
and
i
shall
not
condemn
him
without
positive
proof
of
course
you
and
your
friend
wallingford
had
better
return
to
memphis
while
i
shall
take
the
necessary
steps
to
ascertain
the
cause
of
demar
s
mysterious
harry
and
heartsell
returned
to
their
homes
as
they
were
leisurely
riding
back
in
their
carriage
it
was
agreed
that
heartsell
should
renew
his
suit
for
lottie
s
hand
and
that
harry
was
to
throw
the
weight
of
his
influence
with
his
sister
to
induce
her
to
accept
him
those
two
rash
young
men
were
just
like
thousands
of
others
who
are
ignorant
as
to
the
material
composing
a
true
woman
s
heart
they
imagined
that
lottie
wallingford
would
transfer
her
heart
with
all
its
pure
love
to
heartsell
and
gladly
consent
to
become
his
wife
but
they
were
building
a
magnificent
castle
on
a
sandy
foundation
they
had
a
sad
lesson
to
learn
which
it
would
be
well
for
all
men
to
know
a
woman
s
heart
can
not
be
traded
off
and
bartered
round
like
a
bolt
of
calico
or
a
bale
of
cotton
but
when
it
is
given
to
a
man
it
is
his
he
may
bruise
it
he
may
break
it
but
he
can
not
transfer
it
at
will
a
man
s
heart
is
a
negotiable
instrument
transferable
at
will
but
not
so
with
a
woman
s
i
perhaps
should
not
say
that
all
men
s
hearts
are
negotiable
for
i
know
there
are
exceptions
to
that
rule
but
it
will
apply
in
a
majority
of
instances
it
was
night
when
heartsell
and
wallingford
arrived
at
memphis
and
the
first
thing
they
did
was
to
go
immediately
to
the
old
brick
house
to
ascertain
whether
the
woman
was
gone
or
not
they
found
the
building
empty
they
entered
and
examined
the
rooms
and
after
satisfying
themselves
that
the
woman
was
gone
they
departed
well
wallingford
observed
heartsell
as
they
walked
toward
rockland
s
house
you
see
i
was
right
after
all
she
was
undoubtedly
demar
s
wife
and
they
have
fled
yes
that
is
true
and
i
am
glad
we
are
rid
of
them
demar
was
a
greater
rascal
than
i
ever
thought
he
my
dear
fellow
replied
heartsell
i
never
had
any
faith
in
him
from
the
start
i
always
thought
he
was
a
consummate
hypocrite
he
assumed
a
pious
dignity
that
i
know
was
all
a
sham
wasn
t
it
fortunate
for
your
sister
that
i
happened
to
watch
his
movements
indeed
it
was
heartsell
she
owes
you
a
big
debt
and
i
dare
say
if
love
can
pay
it
she
will
be
glad
to
liquidate
the
ah
you
have
cause
to
be
proud
of
your
charming
sister
do
you
know
that
i
think
she
is
the
most
talented
woman
i
ever
knew
my
sister
is
a
very
sensible
indeed
she
is
wallingford
and
she
has
an
angel
s
disposition
she
is
too
good
for
me
but
if
pure
love
and
devotion
can
make
her
happy
be
assured
she
should
never
know
you
have
heard
of
men
counting
the
chickens
before
they
were
hatched
haven
t
you
heartsell
of
course
i
have
but
what
has
that
to
do
with
this
matter
suppose
lottie
don
t
choose
to
see
things
from
our
standpoint
suppose
she
should
still
put
her
faith
in
demar
oh
that
s
not
a
supposable
case
how
could
she
cling
to
him
when
she
learns
his
true
character
well
you
have
my
good
wishes
in
this
new
enterprise
and
if
i
can
assist
you
command
me
but
here
we
are
at
the
gate
will
you
walk
in
and
take
tea
with
me
no
not
wallingford
i
ll
go
home
now
but
where
can
i
see
you
early
in
the
morning
at
my
very
well
i
ll
call
early
and
pleasant
dreams
to
when
heartsell
parted
with
wallingford
he
sauntered
toward
his
home
whistling
mollie
darling
while
visions
of
triumph
floated
gaily
before
his
imagination
since
the
dreaded
enemy
had
ingloriously
fled
he
thought
as
the
victor
he
was
entitled
to
the
spoils
in
other
words
he
imagined
that
since
demar
s
flight
lottie
would
be
glad
to
throw
herself
into
his
arms
he
was
vain
enough
to
believe
that
she
would
be
ready
to
thank
him
for
the
great
service
he
had
rendered
and
ask
his
pardon
for
having
once
rejected
his
suit
when
wallingford
arrived
at
home
he
went
immediately
to
his
sleeping
room
to
change
his
toilet
before
the
supper
bell
rang
lighting
the
gas
and
looking
at
his
watch
he
found
it
only
lacked
five
minutes
to
eight
he
hurriedly
began
to
arrange
his
dress
ten
minutes
had
elapsed
after
he
entered
the
room
when
he
was
startled
by
a
loud
scream
that
went
ringing
through
the
house
he
ran
rapidly
to
lottie
s
boudoir
what
is
the
matter
mother
exclaimed
wallingford
as
he
appeared
at
the
door
where
he
saw
lottie
lying
insensible
on
a
sofa
and
rockland
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
wringing
her
hands
apparently
wild
with
terror
speak
mother
what
in
heaven
s
name
has
happened
some
terrible
news
must
have
been
brought
in
that
letter
for
she
still
holds
it
crumpled
up
in
her
hand
doctor
demar
s
clerk
delivered
it
to
her
a
few
moments
ago
and
when
she
began
to
read
it
she
turned
deadly
pale
then
screamed
and
demar
has
eloped
with
another
woman
and
she
has
just
now
found
it
out
merciful
providence
my
son
is
that
true
it
is
certainly
so
and
i
trust
she
will
at
once
discard
the
hateful
villain
s
memory
from
her
while
this
conversation
was
going
on
rockland
was
kneeling
by
the
sofa
bathing
lottie
s
pale
face
with
and
in
a
few
moments
evidence
of
returning
consciousness
appeared
i
had
explained
everything
in
the
letter
telling
lottie
that
if
i
did
not
return
by
eight
o
clock
she
might
know
that
i
was
killed
because
i
would
communicate
further
news
if
wounded
it
might
appear
to
be
an
unpardonable
imprudence
on
my
part
to
write
such
a
letter
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
i
did
not
intend
her
to
receive
it
unless
i
was
killed
i
had
written
my
will
bequeathing
my
little
estate
to
her
which
was
also
inclosed
in
the
letter
lottie
was
not
one
of
the
sort
of
hysterical
women
who
faint
every
time
they
see
a
worm
or
a
spider
but
she
was
brave
sensible
and
strong
both
mentally
and
physically
but
notwithstanding
all
her
courage
and
she
was
instantly
overpowered
by
the
contents
of
the
letter
as
soon
as
she
was
able
to
sit
up
harry
attempted
to
take
hold
of
her
hand
when
she
drew
back
with
a
convulsive
shudder
at
the
same
time
uttering
a
suppressed
scream
then
she
cast
on
her
brother
such
a
gaze
as
to
chill
the
blood
in
his
veins
it
was
a
mixture
of
horror
scorn
contempt
and
pity
touch
me
not
i
beg
you
that
hand
is
red
with
a
hero
s
blood
and
cain
s
mark
is
on
your
brow
you
have
murdered
the
noblest
the
kindest
the
best
man
that
ever
called
you
friend
oh
my
unhappy
rash
inconsiderate
brother
pray
on
your
knees
until
the
crack
of
doom
and
maybe
god
will
pardon
you
how
could
you
be
so
cruel
as
to
shed
the
blood
of
a
noble
big
heart
whose
every
throb
was
in
friendship
for
you
had
you
lost
sight
of
the
fact
that
i
owed
my
life
to
the
poor
victim
whose
blood
you
wantonly
shed
how
could
you
face
our
mother
in
heaven
with
eddie
s
blood
dripping
from
your
murderous
hand
if
you
were
to
touch
me
with
that
bloody
hand
of
yours
it
would
kill
me
in
five
minutes
did
you
hate
edward
because
he
was
noble
generous
and
good
did
you
envy
his
gentle
disposition
his
even
temper
and
greatness
of
soul
oh
blessed
redeemer
have
mercy
on
my
unfortunate
rash
brother
forgive
this
awful
crime
and
humble
his
haughty
lottie
i
swear
by
the
heavens
and
all
the
saints
that
never
have
i
shed
one
drop
of
ed
demar
s
blood
he
is
a
hypocritical
villain
who
has
betrayed
and
deceived
you
he
has
eloped
with
another
harry
don
t
slander
the
dead
i
beseech
you
that
would
aggravate
the
awful
crime
you
have
committed
shame
shame
on
you
why
not
kill
me
quickly
as
you
did
edward
instead
of
torturing
me
to
death
why
not
shed
my
blood
while
your
hand
is
in
i
have
no
desire
to
live
any
longer
in
this
wicked
cruel
world
why
should
such
as
i
be
permitted
to
live
in
the
world
when
you
have
hurled
my
eddie
into
a
bloody
grave
why
not
kill
me
too
sister
lottie
i
most
solemnly
declare
by
everything
sacred
that
i
have
not
seen
edward
demar
since
he
left
the
city
yesterday
it
is
true
i
challenged
him
and
he
agreed
to
meet
me
at
horn
lake
at
ten
o
clock
but
instead
of
keeping
his
appointment
he
has
run
away
with
a
woman
that
he
brought
from
edward
told
me
in
his
letter
that
you
had
forced
him
into
a
duel
and
that
he
would
be
here
by
eight
o
clock
if
he
was
not
killed
and
in
that
letter
was
his
will
leaving
his
estate
to
me
how
then
can
you
tell
me
he
has
run
away
you
and
heartsell
have
killed
him
and
in
order
to
conceal
your
crime
you
have
invented
this
falsehood
you
may
go
dig
my
grave
for
there
is
a
sweet
spirit
calling
me
to
heaven
and
i
shall
soon
go
to
meet
the
noblest
soul
that
was
ever
dismissed
from
the
body
by
the
red
hand
of
i
will
bring
heartsell
here
sister
who
will
tell
you
what
i
say
is
do
not
mention
that
man
s
name
in
my
presence
for
he
is
more
guilty
than
you
because
he
has
made
a
dupe
of
you
to
destroy
edward
i
have
tried
edward
demar
in
adversity
as
well
as
prosperity
and
if
a
legion
of
such
men
as
heartsell
were
to
tell
me
he
had
proved
false
i
would
not
believe
it
lottie
then
broke
completely
down
and
would
have
fallen
to
the
floor
but
rockland
caught
her
in
time
to
prevent
it
you
may
put
me
to
bed
mother
i
can
not
fight
it
off
any
longer
i
thought
i
was
very
strong
and
brave
but
this
blow
is
too
much
for
me
all
will
soon
be
over
with
me
my
dear
good
mother
i
feel
it
very
plainly
and
when
i
am
dead
i
want
you
to
have
me
buried
by
the
side
of
eddie
if
his
body
is
ever
found
they
killed
him
for
loving
me
and
the
blow
has
killed
me
too
poor
viola
tell
her
i
shall
expect
to
meet
her
in
heaven
where
wicked
people
can
not
molest
or
make
us
mrs
rockland
then
attempted
to
lead
lottie
to
her
bedroom
but
was
unable
to
do
it
for
she
fell
completely
helpless
on
her
mother
s
bosom
harry
then
stepped
forward
and
attempted
to
take
his
sister
in
his
arms
when
she
began
to
tremble
violently
uttering
a
loud
scream
oh
mother
please
do
not
let
him
touch
me
with
those
bloody
hands
make
him
go
away
then
she
hid
her
face
on
her
mother
s
bosom
while
horrible
convulsions
shook
her
body
look
there
mother
she
exclaimed
as
she
glared
with
dilated
eyes
at
her
brother
do
you
see
that
bloody
stain
on
his
brow
that
is
blood
from
poor
edward
s
heart
drive
the
cruel
murderer
away
leave
us
for
the
present
my
son
whispered
rockland
she
is
going
mad
i
do
believe
harry
rushed
from
the
room
frantic
with
grief
and
tortured
by
an
accusing
conscience
and
began
to
pace
hurriedly
through
the
garden
while
a
horrible
fear
that
he
had
really
driven
his
sister
mad
seized
upon
him
rockland
called
in
the
servants
who
assisted
her
to
carry
lottie
to
her
bedroom
then
a
messenger
was
sent
after
doctor
dodson
who
arrived
at
nine
o
clock
when
he
entered
the
room
he
found
the
patient
in
a
state
of
total
unconsciousness
and
a
burning
fever
had
set
in
while
the
eyes
had
a
wild
lusterless
appearance
every
now
and
then
her
body
would
tremble
violently
for
a
moment
and
be
seized
with
severe
convulsions
lasting
from
ten
to
fifteen
seconds
then
the
nerves
would
relax
and
she
would
remain
quiet
until
another
trembling
fit
would
come
on
the
convulsions
continued
until
after
midnight
and
when
they
ceased
the
doctor
was
compelled
to
resort
to
strong
stimulants
in
order
to
revive
his
patient
the
old
physician
was
too
well
posted
in
regard
to
the
science
of
his
profession
and
the
mysterious
influence
which
the
mind
exercises
over
the
nerves
not
to
know
that
lottie
s
illness
was
the
result
of
mental
distress
ah
ha
here
we
come
madame
he
exclaimed
as
soon
as
he
became
convinced
that
his
patient
was
not
going
to
be
tortured
by
any
more
convulsions
what
has
happened
to
lottie
ah
ha
yes
what
has
happened
mrs
rockland
with
tremulous
voice
proceeded
to
give
a
detailed
history
of
everything
that
had
occurred
while
tears
streamed
from
her
eyes
ah
ha
i
see
how
it
is
oh
that
rash
boy
i
wonder
if
he
has
been
so
cruel
as
to
hurt
edward
he
called
on
heaven
to
witness
the
truth
of
his
assertion
that
he
had
never
drawn
one
drop
of
edward
s
blood
declared
that
he
had
not
seen
him
since
day
before
yesterday
i
believe
he
told
the
truth
for
with
all
his
faults
he
would
not
tell
a
lie
never
has
that
rash
boy
uttered
a
falsehood
in
my
presence
nor
has
he
ever
in
any
manner
attempted
to
deceive
me
he
affirms
that
edward
has
eloped
with
a
woman
that
he
brought
from
ah
ha
that
is
a
pretty
story
indeed
i
say
eloped
with
another
woman
ah
ha
when
he
was
heels
over
head
in
love
with
lottie
now
if
harry
wallingford
can
snatch
the
sun
from
its
fiery
chariot
as
it
spans
the
sky
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
and
convert
light
into
darkness
then
may
he
expect
to
make
me
believe
that
my
boy
is
a
villain
ah
ha
don
t
you
see
my
noble
boy
was
the
very
soul
of
honor
the
paragon
of
men
the
embodiment
of
truth
and
a
stranger
to
deception
ah
ha
you
see
how
it
is
yourself
my
dear
madame
some
intriguing
villain
is
at
the
bottom
of
this
business
and
a
horrible
suspicion
tells
me
that
harry
has
been
led
into
a
trap
ah
ha
yes
he
has
suffered
himself
to
be
used
as
a
tool
by
some
scheming
rascal
who
wanted
to
get
rid
of
my
boy
it
is
heartsell
or
bowles
perhaps
both
ah
ha
don
t
you
see
i
will
ransack
the
globe
and
plow
every
sea
and
skim
every
ocean
but
i
will
find
my
brave
noble
boy
if
they
have
killed
him
they
had
better
get
on
the
other
side
of
the
world
without
delay
else
i
will
increase
the
population
of
hell
with
their
souls
ah
ha
don
t
you
see
how
is
my
sister
now
doctor
said
harry
as
he
met
the
old
physician
on
the
veranda
at
two
o
clock
bad
enough
ah
ha
bad
enough
my
boy
brain
fever
serious
attack
dangerous
disease
life
in
great
peril
bad
business
this
another
bright
angel
added
to
the
heavenly
band
ah
ha
don
t
you
see
how
it
is
my
boy
the
world
loses
heaven
wins
bright
young
life
foolishly
extinguished
had
rather
die
myself
will
save
her
if
possible
but
don
t
believe
it
possible
you
hear
people
talk
about
broken
hearts
ah
ha
that
is
a
mistake
hearts
never
break
the
brain
may
be
broken
then
the
soul
becomes
alarmed
and
deserts
the
body
lottie
s
brain
is
injured
that
affects
the
nerves
ah
ha
don
t
you
see
then
convulsions
ensue
which
worries
the
circulation
and
a
general
collapse
of
the
whole
system
follows
final
result
death
or
insanity
ah
ha
yes
death
winds
up
the
show
in
a
majority
of
such
cases
poor
girl
she
loved
edward
very
dearly
and
he
was
devoted
to
in
that
respect
replied
harry
i
am
sorry
to
inform
you
that
you
are
very
much
mistaken
edward
demar
did
not
love
my
sister
the
fact
that
he
was
a
hypocrite
and
faithless
traitor
has
been
proved
beyond
the
possibility
of
a
doubt
i
was
foolish
enough
to
believe
he
was
an
honorable
man
who
loved
my
sister
truly
but
he
has
betrayed
her
and
eloped
with
another
ah
ha
look
up
there
my
boy
exclaimed
the
doctor
as
he
pointed
heavenward
do
you
see
that
bright
star
yonder
just
to
the
left
of
the
moon
yes
certainly
i
do
but
what
of
that
do
you
notice
how
near
it
appears
to
the
branches
of
that
elm
tree
it
seems
to
be
within
three
feet
of
that
large
limb
ah
ha
do
you
see
it
my
boy
yes
very
true
it
looks
as
if
it
were
fastened
among
the
branches
of
that
ah
ha
yes
very
good
my
boy
will
you
be
so
kind
as
to
step
up
on
top
of
that
tree
pluck
that
beautiful
bright
star
from
its
place
in
the
sky
and
bring
it
to
me
harry
began
to
stare
at
the
doctor
with
feelings
of
anger
and
astonishment
this
is
no
time
to
crack
jokes
doctor
dodson
and
i
am
grieved
to
be
compelled
to
remind
you
of
joking
ah
ha
who
is
joking
i
never
was
in
deeper
earnest
in
my
life
why
do
you
refuse
to
do
such
a
trifling
favor
for
me
i
want
a
pretty
planet
snatched
from
the
heavens
and
you
will
not
do
it
for
doctor
i
confess
your
language
astonishes
me
i
have
ever
had
a
high
regard
for
your
opinion
and
would
make
any
sacrifice
to
serve
you
but
when
you
ask
me
to
do
absurd
impossibilities
you
can
hardly
expect
a
serious
ah
ha
you
tell
me
that
you
can
not
snatch
that
star
from
the
sky
yet
you
try
to
make
me
believe
that
edward
demar
has
eloped
with
another
woman
whenever
i
see
you
take
that
planet
in
your
hand
and
lay
it
down
at
my
feet
then
you
may
try
to
convince
me
that
my
boy
was
dishonest
ah
ha
yes
you
see
how
it
is
yourself
don
t
you
did
you
ever
hear
of
a
certain
monkey
who
raked
the
chestnuts
out
of
the
fire
with
the
paw
of
an
unsuspecting
cat
ah
ha
yes
of
course
you
have
very
good
then
you
are
the
unsuspecting
cat
and
heartsell
is
the
monkey
and
he
has
been
using
your
paw
to
rake
out
his
chestnuts
ah
ha
to
be
plain
that
man
wanted
to
marry
your
sister
she
loved
my
boy
and
therefore
heartsell
wants
him
out
of
the
way
he
uses
you
as
his
tool
to
remove
his
rival
ah
ha
don
t
you
see
heartsell
has
practiced
a
fraud
of
some
sort
on
you
deceived
you
cheated
you
and
in
all
probability
ruined
you
and
killed
your
sister
ah
ha
don
t
you
see
doctor
dodson
replied
wallingford
i
know
my
faults
are
numerous
i
confess
that
my
unfortunate
temper
often
gets
the
advantage
of
my
judgment
i
may
have
acted
too
rashly
in
this
affair
but
it
was
my
duty
to
guard
my
dear
sisters
honor
and
when
i
tell
you
that
she
has
been
deceived
by
ed
demar
i
only
tell
you
that
which
i
know
positively
with
my
own
eyes
i
saw
him
in
the
arms
of
another
woman
that
woman
has
disappeared
so
has
demar
and
that
he
has
fled
with
her
is
a
fact
beyond
at
that
moment
rockland
came
to
the
door
and
requested
the
doctor
to
go
in
to
his
patient
informing
him
that
she
was
again
in
convulsions
harry
hurried
out
of
the
house
and
bared
his
burning
brow
to
the
falling
dew
while
he
beat
his
breast
with
his
clinched
fist
hoping
to
still
the
gnawing
conscience
that
was
torturing
his
restless
soul
all
through
the
night
he
continued
to
wander
in
the
garden
half
mad
with
grief
muttering
to
himself
while
the
hot
blood
in
his
veins
seemed
to
be
collecting
in
his
fevered
cheeks
and
heated
brow
at
early
dawn
he
went
in
search
of
heartsell
and
found
him
sound
asleep
in
his
bedroom
get
up
heartsell
he
said
as
he
hurried
in
i
must
speak
with
what
s
up
now
old
fellow
something
serious
i
guess
else
you
would
not
be
out
so
ah
heartsell
i
never
have
passed
such
a
night
i
did
not
go
to
bed
at
all
my
poor
sister
is
dangerously
ill
she
thinks
that
we
have
murdered
demar
and
the
doctor
is
afraid
she
will
indeed
wallingford
that
is
awful
news
why
should
she
think
that
we
have
killed
demar
he
wrote
her
a
letter
telling
her
all
about
the
contemplated
duel
left
it
with
his
clerk
to
be
delivered
in
the
event
of
his
not
getting
back
by
eight
o
clock
in
that
letter
he
told
her
that
if
he
was
not
killed
he
would
be
at
home
at
eight
and
because
he
did
not
come
she
concludes
that
we
have
killed
him
now
why
should
he
write
such
a
letter
if
he
intended
to
run
away
i
must
confess
that
it
is
very
has
it
ever
occurred
to
you
that
some
accident
might
have
happened
to
him
and
that
he
did
not
absent
himself
willingly
no
i
never
had
dreamed
of
such
a
i
am
afraid
we
have
been
too
hasty
in
this
business
i
love
my
darling
sister
as
i
do
my
life
and
i
begin
to
repent
of
my
rashness
in
this
matter
she
refused
to
let
me
touch
her
shrank
from
me
as
if
i
were
a
savage
wild
beast
ready
to
tear
her
to
pieces
cast
upon
me
such
a
strange
wild
look
as
caused
the
blood
to
freeze
in
my
veins
and
spoke
of
my
hands
being
stained
with
ed
demar
s
blood
then
all
at
once
she
broke
down
and
when
the
doctor
came
he
said
that
she
was
threatened
with
brain
fever
and
before
midnight
she
was
that
is
very
unfortunate
wallingford
and
as
soon
as
she
regains
consciousness
i
ll
go
to
see
her
and
tell
her
that
you
did
not
hurt
demar
she
certainly
will
believe
if
you
take
my
advice
you
will
not
let
my
sister
see
you
until
you
can
prove
demar
to
be
alive
and
unhurt
the
manner
in
which
she
spoke
of
you
was
anything
but
complimentary
i
can
tell
you
she
regards
you
as
the
cause
of
all
the
trouble
accuses
you
of
influencing
me
and
the
truth
is
heartsell
you
did
persuade
me
into
it
we
have
been
rash
and
hasty
in
this
matter
and
i
begin
to
repent
of
the
part
i
have
played
in
it
i
wish
i
could
be
like
other
men
but
my
unfortunate
temper
won
t
let
me
most
people
think
before
they
act
but
i
act
first
and
then
do
the
thinking
when
it
is
too
late
a
most
horrible
suspicion
is
crawling
over
me
i
begin
to
think
after
all
that
demar
has
not
run
away
he
owns
a
in
a
here
with
ten
thousand
dollars
he
made
no
disposition
of
it
except
to
will
his
interest
to
my
sister
in
the
event
of
his
death
he
left
a
sealed
paper
with
his
clerk
to
be
delivered
to
lottie
and
it
turns
out
to
be
a
will
now
if
he
had
been
married
to
the
other
woman
why
should
he
will
his
property
to
my
sister
indeed
that
does
look
a
little
strange
but
what
can
we
do
to
clear
up
the
mystery
put
detectives
to
work
to
find
out
what
has
become
of
demar
has
it
ever
occurred
to
you
that
the
woman
might
have
been
some
relative
of
demar
no
i
have
never
dreamed
of
such
a
thing
but
why
should
he
elope
with
her
if
she
was
a
relation
i
don
t
believe
he
went
away
with
her
because
he
took
a
freight
train
and
started
to
horn
lake
i
believe
he
intended
to
keep
his
appointment
with
us
but
met
with
an
accident
perhaps
has
been
wallingford
your
language
puzzles
me
give
me
time
to
yes
it
is
very
proper
we
should
both
do
a
little
serious
thinking
it
is
a
pity
we
didn
t
do
that
before
instead
of
acting
so
rashly
we
should
have
demanded
an
explanation
of
demar
and
afforded
him
an
opportunity
to
make
it
i
can
see
now
the
great
error
we
committed
he
might
have
been
able
to
explain
it
all
to
our
satisfaction
but
we
did
not
give
him
a
when
harry
left
heartsell
his
affection
for
that
gentleman
was
considerably
decreased
time
continued
to
drag
along
very
slowly
or
at
any
rate
it
seemed
so
to
harry
wallingford
lottie
s
life
appeared
to
be
gradually
but
surely
drawing
to
a
close
her
beautiful
golden
hair
had
commenced
to
come
out
while
the
flesh
appeared
to
shrink
away
the
color
had
fled
from
her
cheeks
and
her
eyes
gazed
listlessly
at
the
ceiling
she
would
lie
immovable
from
day
to
day
never
complaining
never
uttering
a
word
except
occasionally
to
whisper
the
name
of
eddie
when
her
reason
resumed
its
throne
she
continued
to
ask
for
eddie
and
on
being
told
that
he
never
had
been
heard
from
the
tears
would
flow
slowly
down
her
cheeks
they
have
killed
eddie
he
is
in
heaven
though
and
i
am
going
to
see
him
soon
give
me
my
darling
s
picture
when
it
was
given
to
her
she
pressed
it
to
her
pale
lips
you
loved
my
poor
unfortunate
brother
and
never
would
do
him
wrong
yet
they
killed
such
language
was
usually
uttered
in
a
low
tone
and
she
would
continue
for
hours
at
a
time
conversing
to
the
picture
when
harry
would
enter
the
room
she
would
turn
her
face
to
the
wall
and
shiver
as
if
she
were
very
cold
when
he
spoke
to
her
she
would
hold
the
corner
of
a
quilt
over
her
ear
as
if
his
voice
gave
her
pain
the
doctor
finally
advised
him
not
to
visit
his
sister
until
the
state
of
her
mind
should
change
she
thinks
you
have
killed
eddie
said
doctor
dodson
to
harry
and
so
long
as
she
clings
to
that
idea
i
think
it
best
for
you
not
to
let
her
see
you
poor
girl
she
can
t
last
much
longer
there
is
only
one
remedy
that
could
save
her
life
and
i
fear
we
shall
not
be
able
to
get
that
in
what
is
that
doctor
exclaimed
harry
as
a
new
hope
began
to
rise
in
his
breast
if
eddie
could
be
found
she
would
be
all
right
in
a
week
but
if
not
she
will
be
in
heaven
before
that
oh
merciful
providence
what
shall
we
do
doctor
dodson
you
are
not
going
to
let
my
darling
die
are
you
ah
ha
my
dear
boy
we
must
bow
submissively
to
the
will
of
god
a
physician
may
patch
up
the
machinery
but
he
can
t
make
a
human
heart
that
poor
girl
s
heart
is
desperately
wounded
and
nothing
on
earth
can
cure
it
except
a
look
at
eddie
demar
present
him
before
your
sister
alive
and
in
good
health
and
i
warrant
a
cure
fail
to
do
it
and
you
may
go
dig
her
grave
oh
doctor
this
is
horrible
it
will
kill
me
too
if
she
dies
believing
i
have
murdered
eddie
can
t
you
quiet
her
mind
with
opiates
until
her
physical
strength
returns
ah
ha
my
boy
that
s
all
you
know
about
it
i
have
given
her
as
much
of
that
sort
of
medicine
as
her
system
will
bear
and
i
tell
you
again
you
had
better
find
my
boy
and
that
without
delay
unless
you
expect
to
see
your
sister
die
ah
ha
when
that
poor
girl
dies
this
world
will
lose
one
of
its
brightest
jewels
and
heaven
will
receive
one
of
the
brightest
angels
that
ever
went
there
poor
viola
will
lose
her
best
friend
and
we
will
be
left
to
mourn
over
crushed
hopes
i
should
like
to
know
what
sad
fate
has
overtaken
my
poor
boy
he
was
the
light
of
my
life
and
the
joy
of
my
house
ah
ha
indeed
he
was
some
foul
play
somewhere
ah
ha
my
boy
mind
you
though
i
don
t
mean
to
scold
you
harry
ah
ha
you
see
i
couldn
t
have
the
heart
to
do
it
heaven
knows
you
have
enough
to
bear
yes
replied
harry
it
is
all
my
fault
but
i
thought
i
was
acting
for
the
no
doubt
you
did
ah
ha
my
boy
but
it
has
turned
out
to
be
a
bad
job
we
are
all
ruined
unless
eddie
can
be
i
ll
find
him
if
he
is
on
the
globe
doctor
exclaimed
wallingford
as
he
hastened

ivanhoe
and
miss
darlington
nicknamed
scottie
were
as
usual
engaged
in
an
earnest
conversation
the
topic
being
a
mixture
of
sentiment
and
gossip
now
sir
knight
observed
miss
darlington
as
she
led
him
to
a
seat
if
you
feel
inclined
to
engage
in
a
game
of
gossip
on
the
old
threadbare
topic
we
will
stop
here
where
we
will
be
free
from
spies
or
intruders
the
fact
of
the
business
is
i
believe
that
another
day
of
such
intolerable
suspense
will
unsettle
my
perhaps
i
can
furnish
you
a
little
scrap
of
information
that
will
afford
temporary
tell
it
then
without
have
you
noticed
a
little
lad
gliding
about
like
a
ghost
indeed
i
have
and
there
is
a
peculiar
expression
on
his
countenance
that
attracted
my
attention
but
what
about
him
he
is
the
black
domino
s
courier
spy
agent
pilot
general
superintendent
or
something
of
that
by
the
by
i
see
that
same
little
ghostly
lad
yonder
leaning
over
the
banisters
just
beyond
the
pilot
yes
that
is
he
i
happen
to
know
that
he
is
serving
the
lady
in
the
black
domino
in
some
of
her
mysterious
schemes
knowing
as
i
did
how
much
it
would
relieve
you
to
obtain
any
clew
that
would
unravel
the
unpleasant
mystery
by
which
we
are
surrounded
i
took
the
liberty
to
play
the
spy
myself
if
i
have
been
guilty
of
a
mean
thing
and
to
be
candid
i
think
i
have
you
will
have
to
answer
for
the
sin
of
it
for
i
was
prompted
to
it
by
my
anxiety
to
gratify
the
curiosity
of
some
one
who
was
very
dear
to
indeed
i
am
very
grateful
but
pray
tell
me
what
you
have
discovered
i
heard
a
conversation
between
the
little
boy
and
the
lady
in
the
black
well
what
did
it
amount
to
the
lad
pointed
toward
napoleon
and
said
there
is
your
how
do
you
know
that
is
he
inquired
the
black
domino
impatiently
i
have
seen
him
from
where
i
was
hidden
under
the
bed
in
his
replied
the
lad
promptly
and
continued
the
little
fellow
i
can
assure
you
madame
beyond
all
question
he
is
the
very
man
you
are
what
is
the
number
of
his
inquired
the
black
domino
then
the
boy
made
an
answer
which
i
did
not
distinctly
hear
as
they
both
began
to
converse
in
a
low
hurried
tone
there
is
a
stack
of
mattresses
on
the
larboard
side
and
i
was
leaning
against
it
and
they
were
on
the
other
side
after
a
long
whispered
conversation
they
began
to
talk
a
little
louder
and
then
i
heard
the
boy
say
i
have
found
out
all
you
wish
to
know
about
napoleon
and
you
had
better
act
no
not
yet
replied
the
black
domino
my
plans
are
not
ripe
yet
but
you
must
keep
your
eye
on
him
until
i
am
you
may
depend
on
me
to
do
that
replied
the
lad
he
never
shall
leave
this
boat
without
your
you
are
a
splendid
detective
and
shall
be
abundantly
rewarded
for
your
faithful
i
have
already
been
rewarded
said
the
boy
ten
times
more
than
i
deserve
i
would
do
anything
to
please
you
i
thank
my
little
friend
and
mean
to
show
my
gratitude
in
a
tangible
shape
one
of
these
days
i
am
going
to
purchase
a
nice
cottage
for
your
mother
if
i
ever
get
enough
you
are
too
kind
miss
you
have
done
more
for
me
than
i
deserve
but
i
will
serve
you
as
long
as
i
live
i
hope
you
will
succeed
in
bringing
that
bad
man
to
punishment
for
his
wicked
they
then
went
away
and
i
heard
nothing
it
seems
she
is
shadowing
yes
that
is
what
does
it
all
mean
ah
that
is
the
question
i
should
like
to
have
have
you
ever
mentioned
the
subject
to
the
little
boy
call
him
here
and
let
us
endeavor
to
pump
the
secret
out
of
come
here
a
moment
little
man
if
you
the
lad
promptly
approached
and
fixed
his
large
restless
eyes
on
ivanhoe
with
a
look
of
inquiry
what
is
your
name
my
little
friend
spratt
where
do
you
reside
i
have
no
home
at
present
did
you
get
on
board
this
boat
at
memphis
no
where
did
you
get
on
at
friar
s
point
where
are
you
going
to
get
off
i
do
not
know
what
point
i
shall
stop
at
that
depends
on
what
circumstances
if
you
will
excuse
me
sir
i
had
rather
not
tell
oh
certainly
my
little
friend
you
need
not
tell
anything
unless
it
suits
you
do
you
know
the
lady
in
the
black
domino
yes
would
you
object
to
tell
me
who
she
is
i
could
not
do
it
without
her
consent
i
think
she
does
not
want
her
name
known
just
i
will
give
you
this
bill
if
you
will
tell
me
her
i
beg
you
will
excuse
me
i
will
give
you
a
hundred
dollars
if
you
will
tell
me
who
she
i
could
not
do
it
sir
if
you
were
to
offer
me
a
thousand
dollars
does
she
reside
in
memphis
no
where
does
she
reside
then
i
had
rather
not
tell
you
that
do
you
know
the
man
who
personates
napoleon
yes
will
you
tell
me
who
he
is
that
is
also
a
secret
which
i
am
not
at
liberty
to
can
you
tell
me
whether
or
not
he
got
on
this
boat
at
memphis
i
could
tell
you
sir
but
i
must
not
talk
about
him
you
will
soon
know
all
about
what
right
had
you
to
go
into
that
gentleman
s
and
conceal
yourself
under
his
bed
how
did
you
know
i
did
that
sir
i
heard
you
tell
the
lady
in
the
black
domino
about
i
hope
sir
you
did
not
play
the
eavesdropper
no
but
you
and
the
lady
talked
about
the
matter
where
i
could
not
help
hearing
i
hope
sir
that
you
will
not
say
anything
about
what
you
heard
because
if
you
do
you
will
be
sorry
for
it
when
you
know
what
caused
me
to
go
into
his
you
have
been
watching
napoleon
by
the
lady
s
directions
is
that
not
the
way
of
it
since
you
have
made
the
discovery
it
is
useless
for
me
to
deny
it
but
sir
i
beg
you
to
say
nothing
about
how
long
do
you
want
me
to
keep
the
secret
but
a
very
short
time
sir
that
man
who
represents
the
emperor
is
a
very
grand
villain
and
if
you
were
to
reveal
what
you
know
it
might
upset
all
the
plans
we
have
been
arranging
to
capture
why
not
capture
him
now
the
lady
in
the
black
domino
is
waiting
for
something
to
happen
which
i
am
not
permitted
to
very
well
my
little
friend
i
promise
you
i
will
not
reveal
your
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
sir
and
you
shall
know
all
about
the
matter
very
soon
i
will
go
now
sir
if
you
have
nothing
more
to
say
to
as
the
little
fellow
bowed
politely
and
moved
away
scottie
heaved
a
sigh
and
said
heigh
ho
was
anybody
ever
so
inundated
with
mystery
as
we
are
if
they
were
i
should
pity
i
must
say
that
is
a
very
polite
manly
little
fellow
and
that
head
of
his
is
full
of
yes
and
he
has
been
playing
a
very
deep
game
if
i
am
not
very
much
what
in
heaven
s
name
does
it
all
mean
i
would
give
my
bottom
dollar
to
be
able
to
answer
the
let
us
try
and
pump
the
secret
out
of
brazzleman
i
dare
say
he
knows
all
about
i
have
been
trying
to
get
him
to
tell
me
who
the
lady
is
but
he
positively
refuses
to
do
it
in
fact
i
do
not
believe
he
or
the
captain
either
knows
who
she
look
yonder
will
you
that
mysterious
woman
has
been
watching
us
all
the
time
she
is
going
to
that
boy
to
find
out
what
we
have
been
saying
to
him
i
declare
this
is
really
provoking
and
i
am
not
willing
to
submit
to
it
any
longer
can
you
suggest
any
plan
to
get
rid
of
the
nonsense
suppose
we
complain
to
captain
quitman
i
should
not
like
to
do
that
after
making
a
promise
to
the
lad
to
keep
his
how
would
it
do
to
napoleon
on
the
subject
that
would
be
the
most
imprudent
step
we
could
take
for
it
appears
that
the
black
domino
has
got
him
spotted
i
think
we
should
not
say
anything
to
any
one
about
what
we
know
until
something
more
is
see
yonder
she
is
leading
that
boy
to
her
mischief
is
brewing
and
a
culmination
will
be
reached
well
let
matters
jog
along
come
down
and
dance
a
set
i
hear
the
i
have
no
objection
in
fact
i
am
glad
you
proposed
it
as
i
think
the
dance
will
take
my
mind
from
this
unpleasant
subject
i
have
often
heard
of
people
suffering
with
curiosity
but
never
till
now
did
i
know
how
one
could
be
so
much
ivanhoe
then
led
scottie
down
to
the
saloon
and
soon
was
gliding
round
in
a
lively
waltz
with
her
fair
cheek
resting
on
his
shoulder
george
was
looking
supremely
happy
as
he
waltzed
with
the
queen
of
sheba
a
dozen
other
couples
were
enjoying
themselves
while
keeping
time
to
the
splendid
music
come
said
ivanhoe
as
soon
as
the
waltz
was
ended
let
us
go
back
on
deck
as
i
have
thought
of
something
else
to
tell
i
hope
you
are
not
going
to
harp
on
the
same
string
that
is
exactly
what
i
am
going
to
do
but
i
have
something
new
to
tell
you
just
a
moment
before
we
began
to
waltz
george
told
me
that
the
whole
secret
was
what
secret
the
mystery
about
the
black
well
what
does
it
amount
to
she
is
a
confidence
woman
a
female
pickpocket
an
expert
thief
and
that
lad
is
her
now
i
do
not
believe
a
word
of
that
story
for
she
has
been
weeping
frequently
confidence
women
do
not
shed
tears
pickpockets
do
not
act
like
that
i
shall
venture
no
opinion
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
george
says
that
she
has
stolen
a
large
sum
of
money
from
napoleon
and
that
the
boy
helped
her
do
if
that
is
true
why
do
they
not
arrest
her
at
once
they
have
not
got
sufficient
proof
to
justify
that
course
yet
though
they
think
they
will
be
able
to
do
it
very
if
i
live
a
hundred
years
i
never
will
wear
another
mask
or
associate
with
others
who
do
i
am
very
sure
that
we
would
have
enjoyed
our
excursion
much
better
if
we
had
not
appeared
in
i
agree
with
you
there
these
masquerades
are
only
suited
to
furnish
opportunities
for
thieves
to
ply
their
as
soon
as
ingomar
finishes
his
story
and
i
hope
he
will
not
stop
a
moment
until
he
is
through
with
it
we
will
put
an
end
to
this
i
will
go
and
request
the
queen
to
her
party
at
once
so
that
we
may
hear
the
remainder
of
the
tale
without
further
i
wish
you
ivanhoe
then
went
to
look
for
the
queen
who
issued
her
orders
for
the
party
to
meet
immediately
a
majority
of
the
passengers
came
up
with
ingomar
and
the
queen
as
they
were
becoming
deeply
interested
in
the
story
the
maskers
all
being
seated
the
queen
directed
ingomar
to
resume
i
was
very
much
disappointed
when
debar
returned
to
my
cell
and
informed
me
that
the
civil
authorities
refused
to
believe
her
when
she
informed
them
that
i
was
not
her
husband
they
thought
it
was
a
ruse
invented
by
her
to
get
her
husband
out
of
prison
but
she
was
kind
enough
to
bring
a
lawyer
to
see
me
on
the
subject
deediddle
was
a
man
with
a
very
red
nose
and
a
ponderous
stomach
evidently
a
devout
worshiper
of
bacchus
i
don
t
think
i
ever
before
saw
such
a
red
nose
on
a
man
s
face
he
was
a
perfect
talking
machine
and
i
was
rather
distrustful
of
him
but
he
assured
me
that
there
would
be
no
difficulty
in
securing
my
release
fact
is
demar
i
m
an
old
hand
at
the
pump
no
cure
no
pay
is
my
motto
said
deediddle
as
he
wiped
the
perspiration
from
his
brow
with
a
red
handkerchief
of
enormous
size
fact
demar
i
have
walked
in
the
legal
harness
for
twenty
years

i
don
t
know
about

printed

horrible
place

hope
fact

always
yields
to
me
he
is
very
fond
of
whist
and
i
always
let
him
win
then
he
returns
the
favor
when
making
decisions
fact
sir
he
never
decides
against
me
he
always
stops
with
me
during
court

loves
good
wine

best

my
motto
yes

did
but
a
retainer

always
customary
a
small
retainer
say
fifty
dollars
fact
is
demar
business
is
business
you
i
gave
him
fifty
dollars
as
quickly
as
i
could
and
would
have
given
him
double
that
sum
if
he
had
demanded
it
for
heaven

sake
deediddle
said
i
get

out
of
this
miserable
place
and
you

be
well
fact

before

judge
flaxback
is
to
be
in
town
this
very
day
and
i
ll
have
a
served
on
the
sheriff
i
was
glad
when
he
went
away
it
was
but
a
short
while
before
he
returned
accompanied
by
the
circuit
court
clerk
who
came
to
administer
the
oath
that
i
had
to
make
in
order
to
procure
the
writ
i
made
the
oath
and
again
was
left
alone
when
bright
rays
of
hope
began
to
steal
in
on
me
i
laid
myself
down
on
my
hard
bed
and
began
to
gaze
at
lottie
s
picture
my
mind
was
so
intensely
fixed
on
the
dear
image
that
i
did
not
hear
the
jailer
when
he
opened
the
door
thanks
be
to
heaven
eddie
i
have
found
you
at
last
exclaimed
harry
wallingford
as
he
sank
down
by
my
side
and
burst
into
tears
i
am
the
vilest
wretch
that
ever
disgraced
the
face
of
this
green
earth
i
have
spread
misery
and
ruin
around
all
who
loved
me
i
have
broken
lottie
s
heart
and
she
is
dying
doctor
dodson
says
she
can
not
live
three
days
longer
why
was
i
ever
created
i
dare
not
ask
you
to
forgive
me
if
remorse
could
kill
i
would
have
been
dead
long
ago
there
is
a
flaming
fire
consuming
my
vitals
yet
it
will
not
kill
me
lottie
will
die
with
a
curse
on
her
lips
against
me
for
she
believes
i
have
murdered
you
and
it
will
be
too
late
to
undeceive
her
for
she
is
failing
fast
i
have
killed
the
sweetest
sister
that
mortal
man
ever
had
eddie
i
would
give
the
world
if
it
was
all
mine
to
recall
the
past
if
i
could
only
atone
for
the
crimes
that
i
have
committed
poor
viola
has
been
tried
and
convicted
while
lottie
was
too
ill
to
know
anything
about
it
they
have
kept
the
awful
news
from
her
but
she
soon
will
leave
this
wicked
he
then
sank
helplessly
on
the
floor
and
groaned
aloud
i
could
only
stare
at
the
unhappy
boy
whose
rashness
had
caused
all
this
misery
i
felt
no
enmity
toward
him
i
pitied
him
from
the
very
bottom
of
my
heart
i
remembered
how
he
had
loved
viola
and
how
he
must
have
suffered
on
her
account
then
i
thought
of
his
love
for
lottie
and
knew
that
the
errors
he
had
committed
were
caused
by
his
love
for
his
sister
as
soon
as
i
could
sufficiently
command
my
feelings
to
enable
me
to
talk
i
began
to
do
what
i
could
to
console
him
there
is
no
reason
why
you
should
feel
remorse
at
all
grief
comes
natural
under
such
circumstances
remorse
is
the
pain
produced
by
a
consciousness
of
guilt
guilt
can
not
exist
where
there
has
been
no
willful
intent
the
mistakes
you
have
committed
were
errors
of
judgment
not
of
the
heart
it
is
the
intent
that
constitutes
the
crime
you
were
prompted
to
act
by
love
for
your
sister
and
i
feel
more
inclined
to
approve
than
to
condemn
you
i
have
always
loved
you
i
love
you
yet
and
if
lottie
could
live
we
would
all
be
happy
again
rise
up
i
pray
you
let
us
forget
the
past
and
work
together
to
repair
the
errors
committed
i
promise
you
that
so
far
as
my
feelings
are
concerned
no
ever
shall
find
lodgment
in
my
poor
heart
against
eddie
you
are
different
from
all
other
men
your
heart
is
more
noble
more
generous
and
more
forgiving
than
others
it
is
a
knowledge
of
that
fact
that
makes
my
conscience
condemn
me
you
should
have
cut
my
unworthy
head
off
when
i
gave
you
that
insulting
blow
if
you
knew
how
my
conscience
gnaws
and
burns
me
for
that
mean
despicable
act
you
would
indeed
pity
me
you
should
not
feel
so
about
that
because
you
thought
i
had
betrayed
your
sister
and
it
is
a
brother
s
duty
to
protect
the
honor
of
his
sister
the
truth
is
i
think
under
the
same
circumstances
i
should
have
acted
as
you
did
from
what
i
heard
debar
resembles
me
so
much
that
it
requires
close
inspection
to
tell
one
from
the
other
now
you
saw
debar
with
his
wife
in
memphis
and
mistook
him
for
me
you
naturally
concluded
that
i
had
deceived
and
betrayed
your
sister
believing
that
to
be
so
you
determined
to
punish
her
betrayer
harry
i
admire
you
for
it
don
t
ask
me
to
forgive
you
for
there
is
nothing
to
be
yes
but
for
my
rashness
coupled
with
my
unpleasant
temper
all
the
trouble
might
have
been
avoided
you
could
have
explained
everything
but
i
did
not
give
you
a
chance
there
is
where
i
committed
the
unpardonable
error
that
has
ruined
all
of
i
hope
that
things
are
not
so
bad
as
you
seem
to
think
we
must
act
now
and
that
promptly
a
dispatch
must
be
sent
to
doctor
dodson
without
delay
and
if
you
will
go
and
procure
a
messenger
to
take
it
to
the
nearest
telegraph
office
i
will
write
the
dispatch
while
you
are
getting
the
messenger
ready
see
that
he
is
well
mounted
on
a
good
horse
for
he
must
make
at
least
eight
miles
per
hour
it
is
miles
from
here
to
the
nearest
telegraph
office
tell
the
messenger
that
he
shall
have
as
much
money
as
he
wants
if
he
will
make
speed
go
quickly
make
the
necessary
arrangements
while
i
write
the
he
hurried
from
the
jail
instantly
while
i
penned
the
following
message
doctor
dodson
tell
dear
lottie
i
am
well
and
safe
will
be
home
day
after
harry
is
with
me
and
everything
is
explained
a
man
resembling
me
very
much
killed
clanton
he
was
imprisoned
to
await
his
trial
he
escaped
i
was
arrested
and
detained
under
a
mistaken
belief
that
i
was
the
criminal
it
is
a
mere
mistake
of
personal
identity
the
real
criminal
was
in
memphis
harry
saw
him
there
with
his
wife
and
thought
it
was
i
hence
his
enmity
toward
me
it
was
all
a
mistake
everything
is
now
understood
i
will
be
released
on
habeas
corpus
save
dear
lottie
s
life
tell
her
to
live
for
my
sake
send
me
a
dispatch
every
ten
minutes
till
i
by
the
time
the
dispatch
was
ready
harry
returned
accompanied
by
an
intelligent
looking
lad
about
eighteen
years
old
who
promised
to
be
at
the
telegraph
office
with
the
dispatch
inside
of
three
hours
i
handed
him
fifty
dollars
and
directed
him
to
wait
at
the
office
for
an
answer
leave
your
horse
at
the
station
and
procure
a
fresh
one
and
when
the
answer
comes
bring
it
to
me
immediately
i
shall
want
you
to
carry
another
dispatch
as
soon
as
you
bring
the
answer
to
this
one
i
will
pay
all
the
expenses
and
remunerate
you
to
your
entire
satisfaction
then
i
will
give
you
as
a
present
this
fine
gold
the
lad
s
bright
black
eyes
fairly
blazed
with
delight
as
i
held
up
the
pretty
prize
before
him
you
may
trust
me
sir
i
ll
deliver
this
dispatch
in
two
hours
and
a
half
from
this
before
the
last
word
was
out
of
his
mouth
he
was
half
way
and
two
seconds
afterward
i
heard
the
clatter
of
his
horse
s
hoofs
as
he
dashed
down
the
road
i
stood
and
listened
until
the
sound
grew
faint
then
died
away
eddie
said
harry
if
god
only
would
let
dear
lottie
live
i
would
spend
the
remainder
of
my
life
on
my
knees
pouring
out
earnest
thanks
to
him
i
would
discard
pride
and
and
endeavor
to
control
this
unfortunate
temper
of
mine
and
devote
my
days
to
his
i
am
so
glad
to
hear
you
talk
that
way
maybe
god
will
think
of
your
good
resolve
and
reward
it
by
saving
her
life
somehow
i
have
a
hope
that
we
shall
hear
favorable
news
when
our
messenger
returns
i
can
not
think
that
i
am
never
again
to
behold
those
beautiful
blue
eyes
i
can
t
realize
it
the
ways
of
providence
are
full
of
mystery
but
we
know
they
are
ever
just
and
knowing
this
to
be
so
induces
me
to
cling
to
the
hope
that
our
lottie
will
be
spared
it
is
my
candid
opinion
that
if
she
had
been
well
viola
would
have
been
cleared
because
she
was
in
possession
of
strange
facts
in
connection
with
the
case
which
would
have
produced
a
different
ah
my
poor
sister
may
have
believed
in
viola
s
innocence
in
fact
i
know
she
did
but
that
belief
was
founded
on
friendship
instead
of
facts
no
the
proof
was
full
and
complete
and
rockland
told
me
that
during
his
thirty
years
practice
he
had
never
known
the
guilt
of
a
prisoner
so
fully
established
you
no
doubt
imagine
that
you
have
suffered
much
but
your
cause
of
sorrow
is
very
slight
when
compared
with
mine
if
poor
lottie
dies
the
loss
will
be
as
much
mine
as
yours
for
you
can
not
love
her
more
than
i
do
and
when
she
leaves
us
she
will
go
direct
to
heaven
where
you
can
go
to
meet
her
but
how
different
is
it
with
viola
i
loved
her
as
well
as
you
loved
lottie
no
man
ever
loved
a
woman
more
devotedly
than
i
loved
her
i
might
have
borne
to
see
her
die
if
she
was
as
well
prepared
to
meet
god
as
lottie
is
but
when
i
know
that
she
is
forever
lost
to
me
and
perhaps
her
soul
is
lost
too
i
feel
and
know
that
i
can
not
bear
it
the
pardoning
power
of
god
is
unlimited
christ
did
not
die
for
righteous
people
alone
but
to
redeem
sinners
and
if
you
will
have
faith
in
him
and
serve
him
with
all
your
heart
you
may
be
permitted
to
meet
viola
in
heaven
after
all
but
here
comes
deediddle
to
talk
about
the
let
us
hear
what
he
has
to
mr
deediddle
came
blustering
in
and
it
was
with
some
difficulty
that
he
squeezed
his
ponderous
body
through
the
small
door
of
my
cell
ah
confound
such
small
doors
he
muttered
as
he
began
to
brush
the
dust
off
his
coat
with
his
red
bandana
i
can
t
see
why
people
make
such
small
doors
anyway
well
demar
i
dropped
in
merely
to
let
you
know
that
we
are
all
right
judge
flaxback
has
made
the
habeas
corpus
returnable
at
nine
o
clock
morning
he
is
to
spend
the
night
with
me
fact
sir
here
s
his
note
accepting
my
invitation
i
ll
wine
him
dine
him
and
card
him
i
ll
play
whist
with
him
all
night
and
let
him
win
that
will
settle
our
case
all
right
fact
sir
trust
me
to
manage
his
but
deediddle
i
would
prefer
that
no
underhand
means
should
be
used
in
my
case
i
can
prove
my
identity
beyond
all
oh
no
doubt
you
can
demar
but
what
good
will
proof
do
when
the
mind
of
the
court
is
against
you
fact
sir
you
had
better
let
me
manage
the
case
in
my
own
way
fact
is
i
am
an
old
hand
at
the
pump
been
in
harness
over
a
quarter
of
a
century
i
am
the
man
to
pry
you
out
wine
and
whist
are
the
great
levers
to
pry
with
before
flaxback
fact
is
he
can
t
get
round
mr
deediddle
rattled
away
for
nearly
an
hour
and
i
was
glad
when
he
took
his
departure
he
had
been
gone
but
a
few
minutes
when
debar
came
in
harry
gazed
at
her
in
great
astonishment
for
several
seconds
then
said
eddie
this
is
the
lady
i
saw
in
memphis
in
that
old
brick
house
and
i
thought
i
saw
you
there
with
it
was
my
husband
sir
and
not
demar
we
were
stopping
in
an
old
dilapidated
brick
house
my
husband
was
waiting
for
some
money
to
be
sent
to
him
he
made
his
escape
from
this
jail
and
went
to
memphis
i
followed
him
and
one
night
we
fled
as
we
learned
that
detectives
were
following
us
i
have
just
received
a
letter
from
my
husband
he
is
in
matamoras
mexico
and
i
am
going
to
meet
him
as
soon
as
demar
is
i
see
through
it
all
now
you
and
your
husband
left
memphis
on
the
very
night
when
demar
was
arrested
at
horn
lake
this
unlucky
coincidence
led
me
to
believe
that
he
had
eloped
with
you
and
had
been
false
to
my
sister
acting
on
this
belief
i
have
committed
an
unpardonable
blunder
and
caused
my
sister
s
death
and
ruined
all
my
as
debar
wiped
the
fast
falling
tears
from
her
eyes
she
said
i
am
truly
sorry
to
hear
of
your
misfortunes
but
hope
things
are
not
so
serious
as
you
seem
to
think
i
too
have
had
my
share
of
trouble
my
poor
husband
has
been
compelled
to
exile
himself
from
his
country
when
he
was
innocent
i
love
him
and
i
mean
to
go
where
he
goes
i
will
share
his
sorrows
and
do
my
best
to
make
him
happy
it
is
true
that
my
husband
killed
clanton
but
he
did
it
in
and
would
have
been
able
to
prove
it
but
unfortunately
the
only
witness
who
saw
the
whole
transaction
died
soon
after
the
mrs
debar
now
went
away
leaving
me
alone
with
harry
she
promised
to
be
present
on
the
next
morning
at
the
trial
to
give
her
evidence
which
would
of
course
be
greatly
in
my
favor
it
was
after
night
and
just
six
hours
from
the
time
my
messenger
had
started
with
my
dispatch
when
he
came
dashing
into
my
cell
with
an
answer
he
had
made
the
round
trip
a
distance
of
miles
in
six
hours
he
informed
me
that
he
had
to
wait
at
the
office
just
one
hour
for
the
answer
so
he
had
done
the
traveling
in
five
hours
my
hand
trembled
when
i
took
the
dispatch
from
the
messenger
and
well
it
might
for
i
knew
that
little
paper
would
tell
a
tale
that
would
seal
my
fate
it
would
tell
me
whether
or
not
those
charming
blue
eyes
were
ever
again
to
gaze
on
me
it
would
decide
whether
or
not
i
was
ever
to
clasp
dear
lottie
to
my
heart
again
i
hesitated
and
looked
at
harry
but
saw
no
encouragement
there
he
was
as
pale
as
death
and
trembling
from
head
to
foot
and
seemed
to
have
ceased
to
breathe
eddie
he
gasped
you
may
be
prepared
to
hear
the
very
worst
for
her
case
was
hopeless
when
i
left
home
that
telegram
will
either
tell
you
she
is
dead
or
that
she
is
heaven
have
mercy
i
exclaimed
as
i
glanced
over
the
contents
of
the
dispatch
my
worst
fears
were
realized
my
darling
was
dying
it
is
useless
for
me
to
try
to
describe
how
i
felt
when
i
read
the
fatal
news
no
one
can
understand
or
appreciate
it
even
if
i
could
select
words
to
tell
how
great
was
my
misery
it
was
over
half
an
hour
before
either
of
us
spoke
and
there
is
no
telling
when
the
silence
would
have
been
broken
had
it
not
been
for
the
messenger
will
you
wish
to
send
another
dispatch
inquired
the
lad
who
had
been
silently
witnessing
this
painful
scene
if
you
do
sir
i
can
be
ready
to
go
again
as
soon
as
i
can
eat
a
bite
and
procure
a
fresh
i
shall
want
to
send
another
dispatch
at
daylight
in
the
my
audience
will
readily
understand
what
cause
for
grief
i
had
when
the
dispatch
is
read
here
it
is
dear
eddie
the
welcome
news
of
your
safety
received
would
to
heaven
it
had
come
a
week
sooner
it
would
have
saved
our
dear
lottie
s
life
but
alas
it
came
too
late
put
your
trust
in
god
my
unfortunate
boy
and
bear
your
great
sorrow
as
becomes
a
brave
man
lottie
can
not
possibly
live
more
than
hours
longer
she
is
sinking
very
fast
her
mind
is
perfectly
clear
and
when
your
dispatch
was
read
to
her
she
smiled
sweetly
as
her
eyes
brightened
up
then
closing
them
the
tears
began
to
stream
from
them
she
pressed
your
picture
to
her
lips
and
said
poor
eddie
how
glad
i
would
be
to
see
him
before
i
die
then
i
wish
to
see
brother
harry
so
he
can
forgive
the
wrong
i
have
done
him
i
thought
he
had
killed
eddie
and
refused
to
believe
him
when
he
denied
she
talks
of
you
and
harry
all
the
time
i
wish
it
were
so
that
you
could
get
here
before
she
dies
you
might
do
it
if
you
get
released
in
time
for
the
evening
i
will
send
another
dispatch
early
in
the
morning
i
had
sent
up
so
many
silent
but
earnest
prayers
to
god
in
which
i
had
implored
and
begged
him
to
let
my
dear
lottie
live
that
i
was
loth
to
believe
he
would
take
her
from
me
i
could
not
realize
the
fact
that
her
beautiful
young
person
was
to
be
consigned
to
the
grave
when
i
had
seen
her
last
she
was
the
very
picture
of
health
and
life
her
fair
cheeks
all
aglow
with
vivacity
her
large
expressive
eyes
filled
with
evidences
of
hope
and
her
elastic
step
indicating
strength
and
vigor
now
how
was
i
to
realize
the
fact
that
all
this
strength
health
and
vigor
were
gone
while
that
fair
form
was
struggling
in
the
very
arms
of
death
the
fact
is
i
was
so
bewildered
with
grief
that
i
was
unable
to
think
correctly
on
the
subject
harry
spent
the
night
in
my
cell
and
i
can
assert
truthfully
that
he
was
more
completely
subdued
by
his
deep
grief
than
he
ever
had
been
before
i
think
that
a
great
change
was
wrought
in
him
on
that
occasion
which
has
since
proved
of
no
little
benefit
to
him
his
indomitable
pride
was
partially
cured
and
his
haughty
spirit
completely
humbled
he
threw
himself
prostrate
on
the
floor
calling
aloud
to
god
for
help
he
did
not
rise
from
the
floor
during
the
night
though
he
never
closed
his
eyes
in
sleep
sometimes
he
would
remain
silent
for
several
minutes
perhaps
he
was
praying
then
again
he
would
seem
to
be
convulsed
with
his
great
sorrow
i
paced
the
floor
in
silence
for
i
was
sunk
so
deep
in
despair
that
i
was
scarcely
able
to
command
my
voice
my
heart
yearned
for
freedom
my
mind
flew
to
memphis
and
looked
at
my
darling
as
she
was
wrestling
with
death
the
first
gray
streaks
of
approaching
dawn
that
came
stealing
through
my
small
window
were
indeed
a
welcome
sight
to
me
as
soon
as
it
was
light
enough
to
enable
me
to
see
to
write
i
penned
a
message
to
be
immediately
sent
to
doctor
dodson
the
messenger
was
promptly
on
hand
at
six
o
clock
ready
with
a
fresh
horse
to
start
with
my
dispatch
and
long
before
the
sun
began
to
peep
over
the
eastern
hills
he
was
dashing
with
great
speed
toward
the
telegraph
office
he
would
be
back
with
fresh
news
by
eleven
o
clock
by
which
time
i
had
reason
to
believe
i
would
be
restored
to
liberty
and
then
i
would
fly
to
my
darling
after
the
messenger
was
gone
i
instructed
harry
to
go
out
to
the
village
and
secure
two
of
the
best
horses
that
could
be
found
and
to
have
them
ready
saddled
and
hitched
in
the
yard
in
order
that
we
might
be
off
instantly
after
the
trial
should
be
over
i
knew
that
the
trial
would
not
consume
much
time
as
the
proof
would
be
ample
and
unquestionable
and
i
thought
maybe
we
might
be
able
to
start
by
ten
o
clock
the
rough
blacksmith
who
had
riveted
the
irons
on
my
leg
was
employed
the
evening
before
the
trial
to
cut
them
off
and
i
was
enabled
to
secure
a
little
exercise
in
his
rough
uncouth
manner
the
blacksmith
apologized
for
the
unkindness
he
had
shown
toward
me
when
fastening
the
manacles
on
my
limbs
as
i
was
not
in
a
mood
to
cherish
i
accepted
the
blunt
apology
and
extended
my
hand
to
the
honest
mechanic
who
seized
and
gave
it
a
hearty
shake
never
saw
two
peas
more
alike
than
you
and
debar
no
wonder
the
officer
took
you
for
debar
i
was
ready
to
swear
that
you
were
the
identical
man
it
s
lucky
they
found
out
the
blunder
ain
t
it
they
might
have
hung
you
by
mistake
that
would
have
been
rather
awkward
wouldn
t
it
i
made
no
answer
to
this
strange
inquiry
for
i
was
thinking
about
other
things
harry
returned
soon
and
informed
me
that
he
had
been
so
fortunate
as
to
secure
two
splendid
young
horses
whose
owner
had
informed
him
that
they
could
take
us
to
the
station
in
two
hours
and
a
half
without
any
danger
of
hurting
them
my
dungeon
door
was
now
thrown
open
and
all
restraint
on
my
movements
withdrawn
i
thought
you
were
the
same
scamp
who
broke
jail
and
left
me
with
the
bag
to
hold
said
the
jailer
everybody
was
down
on
me
for
letting
debar
get
away
when
i
couldn
t
help
it
some
rascal
furnished
him
with
tools
and
i
knew
nothing
about
it
until
he
was
gone
therefore
when
they
brought
you
here
i
thought
you
were
the
same
man
and
i
didn
t
care
to
be
kind
to
the
man
who
had
acted
so
badly
as
debar
you
are
the
very
image
of
debar
and
then
your
name
sounds
so
much
like
his
i
can
detect
a
slight
difference
in
the
color
of
your
hair
and
that
of
debar
then
he
had
a
small
scar
on
his
forehead
just
above
the
left
eye
it
was
very
slight
and
quite
small
not
over
half
an
inch
long
i
have
his
photograph
here
and
if
you
will
look
close
you
can
see
the
scar
very
i
looked
at
the
picture
and
sure
enough
the
scar
could
be
plainly
seen
this
circumstance
of
itself
would
justify
judge
flaxback
in
ordering
my
release
in
fact
the
trial
would
be
a
mere
form
to
be
complied
with
as
everybody
now
admitted
that
a
mistake
had
been
committed
the
villagers
discussed
it
on
the
street
corners
and
laughed
over
it
cracking
their
jokes
little
dreaming
of
the
awful
consequences
that
had
resulted
to
me
by
the
mistake
i
dare
say
that
a
vastly
different
feeling
would
have
permeated
the
breasts
of
those
people
if
they
could
have
witnessed
the
dying
agonies
of
poor
lottie
wallingford
if
they
had
known
how
my
heart
was
broken
by
the
sad
mistake
they
would
not
have
been
laughing
and
joking
about
the
matter
as
if
it
were
a
very
funny
coincidence
i
could
not
eat
my
breakfast
my
appetite
was
gone
but
i
drank
a
cup
of
warm
tea
which
the
jailer
s
wife
was
kind
enough
to
bring
to
me
she
seemed
to
sympathize
with
me
when
she
found
out
how
deeply
i
had
been
wronged
i
looked
at
my
watch
every
five
minutes
i
was
full
of
impatience
it
seemed
that
nine
o
clock
would
never
come
but
nevertheless
it
did
come
at
last
the
town
clock
began
to
strike
when
the
jailer
said
it
was
time
to
chapter
xxvi
during
the
short
recess
the
queen
had
agreed
to
allow
which
was
granted
at
the
request
of
the
barbarian
chief
the
excursionists
assembled
in
various
little
groups
on
different
parts
of
the
boat
while
most
of
them
were
discussing
the
merits
of
ingomar
s
story
george
and
the
duke
of
wellington
were
seated
apart
from
the
other
passengers
deeply
interested
in
an
animated
discussion
the
subject
being
the
eccentric
movements
of
the
black
domino
and
the
unusual
sadness
of
the
queen
my
lord
observed
the
king
did
you
notice
that
the
queen
fainted
when
those
two
men
arrested
demar
of
course
i
did
and
that
is
not
all
the
lady
in
the
black
domino
fainted
too
when
the
barbarian
chief
was
now
i
would
like
very
much
to
know
who
this
barbarian
chief
is
and
why
both
of
those
women
should
manage
to
faint
about
him
i
have
never
been
so
fortunate
as
to
have
as
much
as
one
woman
care
enough
about
me
to
faint
for
as
to
that
i
am
decidedly
of
the
opinion
that
you
have
lost
nothing
on
that
score
but
between
you
and
me
there
is
something
mysterious
connected
with
that
woman
in
the
black
domino
so
far
as
the
queen
is
concerned
i
imagine
that
she
is
one
of
those
sympathetic
women
the
kind
who
have
more
tears
than
talent
a
sort
of
look
at
that
man
yonder
leaning
against
the
corner
of
the
texas
and
see
if
you
can
discover
anything
singular
about
why
that
is
henry
of
navarre
of
course
there
is
nothing
strange
about
him
why
do
you
ask
the
question
he
is
not
the
man
who
wore
that
uniform
when
we
started
from
why
do
you
conclude
that
he
is
not
the
one
who
personated
navarre
at
the
ball
he
is
not
quite
so
tall
but
has
a
more
dignified
carriage
and
then
he
does
not
mingle
with
us
or
participate
in
any
of
our
amusements
as
the
real
navarre
did
the
original
napoleon
has
also
slipped
out
of
his
costume
and
a
counterfeit
has
slipped
in
and
the
strangest
part
of
the
mystery
is
that
no
one
knows
what
has
become
of
the
parties
who
originally
personated
navarre
and
napoleon
now
if
this
is
done
in
order
to
enable
those
men
to
play
a
little
joke
on
the
ladies
there
is
no
harm
in
it
but
i
suspect
that
some
sort
of
mischief
is
afloat
i
guess
it
will
appear
in
the
that
these
two
men
and
the
black
domino
are
in
some
way
interested
in
each
other
and
you
may
be
sure
if
they
are
that
it
will
produce
the
truth
is
we
are
all
engaged
in
playing
a
farce
and
i
am
heartily
ashamed
of
my
part
of
it
it
reminds
me
of
shakespeare
s
much
ado
about
i
can
not
by
any
means
indorse
that
idea
for
i
have
been
very
much
interested
in
ingomar
s
it
is
too
tedious
give
me
something
lively
something
to
make
me
laugh
such
as
bill
arp
or
artemus
ward
don
quixote
or
mark
i
prefer
love
stories
i
like
to
read
about
women
who
prefer
death
to
a
loveless
marriage
and
men
who
are
always
getting
into
scrapes
in
attempting
to
protect
i
guess
then
you
like
the
bride
of
lammermoor
and
the
talisman
yes
and
all
the
other
thrilling
novels
written
by
sir
walter
don
quixote
now
came
up
and
joined
the
king
and
duke
in
the
conversation
which
soon
drifted
back
to
the
lady
in
the
black
domino
by
the
by
exclaimed
don
quixote
i
think
that
mysterious
woman
is
about
to
stir
up
a
row
between
napoleon
and
navarre
the
cauldron
is
boiling
and
bubbling
furiously
and
blood
is
on
the
face
of
the
how
do
you
know
that
blood
is
on
the
moon
when
that
planet
is
on
the
other
side
of
the
globe
of
course
you
understand
i
was
speaking
metaphorically
as
to
that
but
really
i
should
not
be
at
all
surprised
to
hear
of
a
requisition
being
made
for
pistols
and
coffins
for
two
to
be
more
explicit
i
think
a
duel
is
on
the
now
sir
knight
said
the
duke
if
you
are
in
possession
of
any
news
that
will
in
any
manner
relieve
our
minds
about
that
strange
woman
i
earnestly
beg
you
to
let
us
hear
it
at
once
for
you
know
what
a
deluge
of
curiosity
she
has
manufactured
on
this
i
am
very
sorry
to
be
unable
to
furnish
any
information
on
that
point
of
a
reliable
nature
all
is
conjecture
as
far
as
the
black
domino
is
concerned
she
has
had
a
long
interview
with
the
captain
i
happened
to
hear
enough
of
the
conversation
to
convince
me
that
navarre
and
napoleon
were
the
parties
discussed
then
the
captain
appeared
to
be
angry
and
i
distinctly
heard
him
mutter
an
oath
or
two
after
he
parted
with
the
black
domino
colonel
confed
informed
me
that
a
duel
was
likely
to
be
fought
and
that
the
lady
in
the
black
domino
was
at
the
bottom
of
it
but
he
refused
to
mention
the
names
of
the
parties
to
the
quarrel
though
i
am
convinced
from
what
i
have
heard
that
navarre
and
napoleon
are
to
be
the
i
guess
it
will
turn
out
to
be
a
tempest
in
a
teapot
or
a
mouse
born
of
a
mountain
replied
the
duke
as
he
handed
the
king
and
don
quixote
a
fresh
cigar
i
wish
continued
the
duke
that
colonel
confed
and
general
camphollower
would
cease
their
continual
clamor
about
politics
they
have
bored
every
man
on
this
boat
half
to
death
and
each
one
seems
to
imagine
that
the
fate
of
the
nation
depends
on
his
they
have
succeeded
in
bridging
the
bloody
chasm
but
they
have
split
on
the
state
rights
question
they
have
generously
consented
that
the
war
shall
be
considered
at
an
now
that
indeed
was
very
kind
of
them
for
i
dislike
to
hear
people
continually
harping
on
the
war
but
let
that
pass
and
we
will
go
back
to
the
subject
did
you
tell
the
captain
that
napoleon
and
navarre
were
interlopers
intruders
counterfeits
wolves
in
sheep
s
clothing
how
could
i
impart
information
that
i
did
not
possess
myself
what
do
you
mean
by
intruders
interlopers
etc
then
the
duke
imparted
to
don
quixote
the
grounds
of
his
suspicion
they
are
not
the
same
men
who
personated
navarre
and
napoleon
at
the
ball
i
would
risk
anything
on
the
truth
of
my
assertion
and
they
are
both
spotting
the
black
if
that
is
true
replied
don
quixote
it
is
our
duty
to
mention
it
to
the
captain
without
delay
and
gentlemen
i
further
suggest
that
we
combine
our
wits
and
if
possible
prevent
any
hostile
meeting
if
such
is
contemplated
by
any
of
our
excursionists
in
the
first
place
i
am
opposed
to
the
barbarous
practice
of
dueling
upon
principle
then
it
is
prohibited
by
the
laws
of
the
land
and
positively
contrary
to
god
s
holy
ordinances
in
addition
to
all
these
objections
we
must
remember
that
a
duel
might
put
an
end
to
all
of
our
innocent
amusements
therefore
i
wish
to
know
whether
you
will
with
me
in
the
effort
to
prevent
it
we
certainly
think
your
views
very
correct
and
will
gladly
join
you
in
your
peaceful
mission
but
i
am
of
the
opinion
that
it
is
a
false
it
required
some
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
to
collect
the
entire
party
for
they
were
scattered
about
the
boat
deeply
interested
in
conversation
nearly
every
one
of
the
maskers
had
been
discussing
the
mysterious
woman
in
the
black
domino
at
length
the
queen
ascended
her
throne
and
after
a
moment
s
pause
ordered
ingomar
to
proceed
when
i
was
conducted
into
the
by
the
deputy
sheriff
his
honor
judge
flaxback
occupied
the
judicial
bench
fixing
his
little
round
eyes
on
me
he
surveyed
me
like
a
snake
endeavoring
to
charm
a
bird
a
large
crowd
of
village
idlers
had
assembled
in
the
house
attracted
there
no
doubt
by
the
peculiarity
of
the
case
flaxback
reminded
me
of
an
egyptian
mummy
that
i
had
seen
in
a
museum
he
was
a
little
specimen
of
decaying
humanity
exhibiting
in
his
person
and
dress
unmistakable
evidence
of
dissipation
and
dilapidation
his
nose
had
evidently
been
broken
with
a
heavy
blow
of
some
sort
for
an
ugly
scar
was
apparent
running
horizontally
across
his
face
while
his
nostrils
flared
outward
presenting
rather
an
ugly
appearance
he
rested
his
chin
on
a
plank
in
front
of
his
seat
and
continued
to
gaze
at
me
with
a
lazy
sort
of
a
stare
that
caused
my
cheeks
to
burn
with
indignation
every
man
in
the
room
had
his
eyes
riveted
on
me
staring
with
open
mouth
as
children
do
at
an
elephant
while
flaxback
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
the
inspection
to
be
completed
before
proceeding
with
the
case
when
a
drop
of
blood
starts
from
such
a
man
s
heart
with
a
view
of
making
a
journey
to
his
extremities
to
furnish
a
little
life
to
them
it
bids
a
long
adieu
to
its
home
knowing
that
the
chances
are
ten
to
one
in
favor
of
its
freezing
to
death
on
the
way
i
sat
and
impatiently
watched
the
strange
looking
judge
wondering
why
he
did
not
proceed
to
dispose
of
my
case
he
continued
to
eye
me
for
full
thirty
seconds
and
then
in
a
voice
sounding
like
that
made
with
a
file
when
being
need
to
sharpen
a
handsaw
he
ordered
the
clerk
to
read
the
sheriff
s
return
on
the
writ
of
no
return
made
sir
said
the
clerk
as
he
began
to
grab
promiscuously
about
snatching
up
every
paper
in
sight
and
looking
as
if
he
were
hunting
for
a
small
hole
to
crawl
into
where
s
the
sheriff
demanded
the
judge
in
a
voice
which
was
evidently
meant
to
be
loud
and
threatening
but
which
really
did
not
amount
to
a
respectable
whine
fact
is
may
it
please
your
honor
said
deediddle
the
sheriff
has
just
stepped
over
to
dick
sninkle
s
saloon
to
get
a
glass
of
a
smile
might
have
been
seen
on
the
faces
of
a
majority
of
the
spectators
they
all
knew
that
water
did
not
agree
with
the
sheriff
the
officer
soon
made
his
appearance
and
the
judge
asked
him
why
he
had
neglected
to
return
the
writ
the
writ
commanded
me
to
bring
the
body
of
edward
demar
before
the
court
and
here
he
is
what
else
could
i
do
mr
clerk
said
flaxback
enter
a
fine
of
ten
dollars
against
postholder
for
failing
to
return
the
writ
and
unless
the
return
is
instantly
made
the
fine
will
be
the
sheriff
was
so
badly
confused
that
he
did
not
know
what
he
was
about
he
cast
an
imploring
look
at
the
clerk
made
a
dash
at
a
pile
of
papers
on
the
clerk
s
desk
then
looked
up
at
the
ceiling
like
an
old
duck
listening
for
thunder
when
her
puddle
had
gone
dry
while
all
this
nonsense
was
being
exhibited
i
was
sitting
there
suffering
indescribable
torture
every
moment
of
time
seemed
to
be
worth
a
mint
of
money
to
me
yet
it
was
being
wasted
by
those
people
as
if
it
were
valueless
there
is
no
telling
when
the
farce
would
have
ended
but
for
harry
s
thoughtfulness
he
took
the
writ
and
in
three
minutes
wrote
out
the
return
and
requested
the
sheriff
to
sign
it
which
he
was
very
glad
to
do
he
would
have
signed
his
own
death
warrant
then
without
objection
deediddle
now
made
a
raid
to
the
front
and
began
to
address
the
court
fact
is
your
honor
it
is
unnecessary
to
enter
into
an
investigation
of
the
circumstances
connected
with
the
murder
of
clanton
as
this
is
purely
a
question
of
personal
identity
if
the
prisoner
at
the
bar
is
not
edward
debar
why
of
course
he
will
be
discharged
fact
sir
the
district
attorney
consented
that
the
investigation
might
be
confined
to
the
question
of
personal
identity
swear
your
witness
clerk
growled
the
judge
the
clerk
began
to
hunt
for
the
bible
why
don
t
you
swear
your
witnesses
mr
clerk
screamed
the
judge
impatiently
the
clerk
became
more
confused
he
grabbed
up
a
book
which
he
thought
was
the
bible
but
when
he
found
out
that
it
was
mark
twain
s
innocents
abroad
he
let
it
fall
on
the
floor
and
began
to
grab
at
everything
in
the
shape
of
a
book
if
you
don
t
swear
these
witnesses
mr
clerk
i
ll
send
you
to
jail
screamed
flaxback
by
this
time
the
clerk
could
have
been
passed
off
as
a
maniac
his
actions
were
frightful
he
threw
out
both
hands
in
every
direction
and
at
last
snatched
up
george
s
digest
and
swore
the
witnesses
on
it
before
he
discovered
his
mistake
mrs
debar
was
put
on
the
stand
first
she
testified
to
the
fact
that
while
i
was
very
much
like
her
husband
i
was
not
the
man
the
district
attorney
put
her
through
a
rigid
not
because
he
thought
she
was
swearing
falsely
but
he
had
a
suspicion
that
she
had
aided
her
husband
in
making
his
escape
mrs
debar
said
the
district
attorney
didn
t
you
smuggle
the
tools
into
the
jail
to
enable
your
husband
to
effect
his
escape
harry
sprang
to
his
feet
in
a
moment
his
eyes
flashing
with
anger
i
trembled
because
i
was
afraid
he
was
going
to
commit
some
imprudent
act
that
might
detain
us
when
i
was
so
anxious
to
be
flying
toward
lottie
but
i
had
cause
to
change
my
mind
very
soon
for
he
made
a
modest
but
eloquent
appeal
to
the
court
in
behalf
of
the
unfortunate
wife
who
was
in
tears
i
appeal
to
this
honorable
court
said
he
to
protect
this
unfortunate
lady
her
condition
is
such
as
to
entitle
her
to
the
sympathies
of
all
good
men
the
law
does
not
require
her
to
answer
questions
that
would
tend
to
criminate
her
and
even
if
the
law
did
not
protect
her
the
dictates
of
common
humanity
should
be
a
sufficient
motive
to
induce
the
honorable
attorney
for
the
state
to
withdraw
such
a
question
we
must
remember
that
we
have
been
taught
to
admire
the
devotion
which
a
wife
feels
for
her
husband
a
true
wife
will
not
forsake
her
husband
when
misfortunes
overtake
him
but
the
greater
his
troubles
are
the
closer
she
will
cling
to
him
and
it
should
prompt
every
true
gentleman
to
respect
the
noble
sentiment
of
love
that
induces
her
to
do
when
harry
took
his
seat
a
murmur
of
approval
was
heard
among
the
spectators
and
the
district
attorney
said
i
fully
indorse
the
sentiments
so
eloquently
expressed
by
my
young
friend
and
will
therefore
not
press
the
question
further
i
will
also
say
to
the
court
that
i
am
fully
satisfied
that
demar
has
been
unjustly
imprisoned
i
was
well
acquainted
with
edward
debar
and
i
hesitate
not
to
say
that
i
never
saw
two
men
so
much
alike
as
he
and
demar
though
if
they
were
both
present
i
think
a
considerable
difference
might
be
detected
debar
had
a
slight
scar
over
his
left
eye
which
alone
would
be
sufficient
to
distinguish
him
from
the
prisoner
now
at
the
bar
i
therefore
give
my
consent
if
the
court
please
that
demar
may
be
let
the
prisoner
be
discharged
sheriff
growled
the
judge
as
he
ordered
the
officer
to
adjourn
court
and
the
great
farce
was
ended
no
doubt
the
judge
and
all
of
his
officers
imagined
that
they
had
done
for
me
a
very
great
favor
in
releasing
me
for
which
it
was
my
duty
to
feel
grateful
now
i
am
in
favor
of
a
faithful
enforcement
of
the
laws
but
the
law
is
often
used
by
unworthy
men
as
a
means
of
oppression
judicial
murder
has
been
committed
in
the
state
where
i
was
so
unjustly
punished
by
imprisonment
the
case
of
young
boynton
mentioned
by
wharton
in
his
treatise
on
criminal
law
might
be
cited
in
proof
of
this
that
poor
boy
was
hung
by
the
neck
until
he
was
dead
for
a
crime
he
did
not
commit
he
was
a
mere
lad
only
eighteen
he
was
charged
with
the
murder
of
ellis
and
when
he
was
led
out
by
the
sheriff
to
be
executed
he
began
to
scream
and
beg
the
spectators
to
save
him
declaring
before
god
that
he
was
innocent
he
leaped
from
the
scaffold
into
the
arms
of
the
assembled
multitude
imploring
them
to
protect
him
poor
boy
he
was
put
to
death
and
before
his
body
had
mingled
with
the
dust
the
real
murderer
died
and
on
his
confessed
that
he
had
murdered
ellis
and
that
young
boynton
was
innocent
this
scene
was
enacted
in
a
county
adjoining
the
one
where
i
had
been
so
unjustly
held
as
a
prisoner
who
shall
be
able
to
repair
the
injury
so
wrongfully
inflicted
on
me
who
will
ever
know
the
extent
of
the
wrong
three
minutes
had
scarcely
elapsed
after
my
release
when
harry
and
i
were
mounted
on
our
steeds
and
dashing
down
the
road
at
a
rapid
speed
i
knew
that
if
we
got
to
the
station
in
time
to
meet
the
train
we
would
have
to
press
our
horses
to
their
utmost
powers
our
steeds
were
young
vigorous
and
full
of
good
mettle
and
needed
no
whip
or
spur
to
urge
them
on
let
them
go
as
fast
as
you
like
said
the
owner
of
the
noble
animals
as
he
handed
me
the
reins
they
have
excellent
bottom
and
will
carry
you
as
swift
as
the
we
had
much
uneven
ground
to
pass
over
many
tall
hills
to
climb
and
innumerable
gullies
to
leap
but
we
never
halted
on
on
we
dashed
we
had
placed
ten
miles
of
ground
between
us
and
the
village
of
p
when
i
saw
the
courier
coming
at
a
gallop
to
meet
me
his
horse
was
foaming
with
perspiration
convincing
me
that
he
had
been
hard
pressed
the
lad
dashed
up
and
handed
me
a
dispatch
i
had
to
wait
two
hours
at
the
office
before
the
answer
came
said
the
boy
as
he
placed
the
envelope
in
my
hand
this
time
i
was
prepared
for
the
awful
news
hence
i
did
not
feel
such
a
shock
as
i
had
felt
when
the
other
dispatch
was
handed
to
me
though
the
news
was
worse
than
that
contained
in
the
first
telegram
but
you
would
probably
understand
matters
better
by
hearing
the
telegram
read
it
is
from
doctor
dodson
who
remained
with
lottie
all
the
time
dear
eddie
your
second
message
was
received
i
deeply
regret
that
i
have
nothing
but
the
worst
news
to
communicate
our
darling
lottie
is
slowly
but
surely
passing
away
she
may
possibly
live
hours
longer
though
i
think
she
will
die
i
would
be
so
glad
if
you
and
harry
could
get
here
before
she
dies
because
she
expresses
such
great
anxiety
to
see
you
she
says
she
does
not
feel
a
particle
of
pain
god
seems
to
be
merciful
in
that
respect
her
mind
remains
perfectly
clear
and
she
converses
rationally
but
most
of
her
conversation
is
about
you
and
harry
i
believe
if
she
could
see
you
it
would
greatly
relieve
her
mind
and
that
then
she
would
pass
away
without
a
struggle
if
you
could
reach
home
you
might
see
her
before
she
dies
may
god
in
his
great
mercy
give
you
courage
and
strength
to
bear
this
great
loss
with
becoming
fortitude
as
soon
as
i
finished
reading
this
telegram
i
handed
it
to
harry
then
told
the
messenger
to
go
to
the
village
and
remain
till
morning
so
as
to
give
his
horse
the
necessary
rest
and
the
next
day
to
go
back
to
the
station
and
get
our
horses
and
deliver
them
to
the
owner
i
presented
him
my
fine
gold
watch
as
a
reward
for
his
faithful
services
then
dashed
away
as
fast
as
my
gallant
steed
could
carry
me
when
we
were
within
five
miles
of
the
station
harry
looked
at
his
watch
and
observed
if
we
get
to
the
station
in
time
for
the
we
will
have
a
close
race
indeed
we
have
only
twenty
minutes
to
make
the
five
i
did
not
believe
that
i
was
doing
wrong
on
that
occasion
when
i
urged
my
noble
horse
forward
to
the
very
top
of
his
speed
i
knew
it
would
distress
and
press
him
both
for
us
to
make
it
in
time
yet
i
believed
he
could
do
it
without
endangering
his
life
my
conclusions
were
correct
for
we
did
dismount
at
the
station
as
the
train
dashed
into
the
streets
of
the
little
town
we
gave
our
horses
in
charge
of
the
livery
stable
keeper
and
stepped
on
the
platform
just
as
the
train
began
to
move
i
wish
i
could
convey
to
my
audience
a
correct
idea
of
my
feelings
when
i
began
to
hope
i
would
reach
home
in
time
to
see
lottie
before
death
claimed
her
i
hastily
wrote
a
dispatch
with
my
pencil
intending
to
have
it
sent
forward
from
the
next
office
notifying
doctor
dodson
that
we
were
on
the
train
and
would
reach
home
that
night
here
is
the
identical
telegram
i
have
been
careful
to
preserve
them
dear
doctor
we
are
aboard
the
train
and
will
be
home
for
heaven
s
sake
don
t
let
my
darling
die
before
we
come
send
an
answer
so
it
will
meet
us
at
grenada
we
are
due
there
at
eight
o
clock
tell
lottie
that
we
are
begging
god
to
spare
her
dear
life
cheer
her
up
with
hope
i
can
t
bear
the
thought
of
losing
my
darling
this
dispatch
was
handed
to
the
operator
at
the
first
office
we
reached
who
promised
to
forward
it
without
delay
then
i
dropped
down
on
my
seat
and
spent
every
moment
in
earnest
prayer
it
was
fifteen
minutes
past
eight
when
the
train
arrived
at
grenada
and
i
believe
that
city
is
just
one
hundred
miles
from
memphis
that
is
the
place
where
the
mississippi
and
tennessee
railroad
connects
with
the
new
orleans
louis
and
chicago
railroad
and
we
would
have
to
take
the
mississippi
and
tennessee
road
to
go
to
memphis
as
soon
as
the
train
halted
i
hastened
to
the
telegraph
office
to
inquire
for
news
as
i
was
expecting
an
answer
to
my
last
message
i
was
well
acquainted
with
the
young
man
who
had
charge
of
the
office
at
grenada
he
had
formerly
resided
in
memphis
he
was
about
my
own
age
and
we
had
been
bosom
friends
for
many
years
i
rushed
into
his
presence
and
hurriedly
inquired
if
there
was
a
dispatch
in
the
office
for
me
take
a
seat
demar
said
the
operator
you
look
very
ill
can
i
do
anything
for
you
any
telegram
here
for
me
i
exclaimed
disregarding
his
kind
offer
yes
he
hesitatingly
answered
but
you
had
better
take
a
seat
and
compose
yourself
before
you
read
it
the
news
it
brings
is
very
bad
though
i
infer
that
you
have
been
expecting
the
objects
in
the
room
seemed
to
be
running
round
a
blindness
began
to
close
over
my
eyes
and
i
felt
a
smothering
sensation
in
my
throat
and
lungs
the
operator
very
fortunately
happened
to
think
of
a
bottle
of
spirits
of
camphor
that
he
had
bought
from
the
that
day
he
seized
it
and
sprinkled
my
face
and
moistened
my
beard
with
the
liquid
which
i
believe
prevented
me
from
fainting
after
a
few
minutes
had
elapsed
i
requested
him
to
give
me
the
dispatch
you
may
give
it
to
me
now
i
said
because
i
am
prepared
for
the
very
he
handed
the
envelope
to
me
and
i
read
the
following
words
my
dear
boy
trust
in
god
he
alone
can
comfort
you
now
our
darling
is
dying
death
began
to
lay
his
cold
hands
on
her
dear
body
at
four
o
clock
she
may
linger
four
or
five
hours
longer
but
i
think
all
will
be
over
before
that
time
she
expressed
so
much
anxiety
to
see
viola
that
the
sheriff
very
kindly
consented
to
bring
her
here
and
when
they
met
it
was
the
most
affecting
scene
i
ever
witnessed
i
fear
we
committed
an
error
in
allowing
viola
to
come
because
as
soon
as
the
sheriff
started
away
with
his
prisoner
lottie
became
worse
and
is
still
rapidly
failing
but
how
could
i
have
the
heart
to
refuse
to
let
her
see
viola
when
she
insisted
so
earnestly
to
have
her
sent
for
lottie
leaves
many
messages
of
love
with
us
to
be
delivered
to
you
when
you
come
provided
you
do
not
arrive
in
time
to
receive
them
from
her
own
lips
i
beseech
you
my
dear
boy
to
bow
submissively
to
the
will
of
god
and
remember
you
can
meet
lottie
in
heaven
if
you
try
you
will
also
understand
that
you
are
not
the
only
one
who
grieves
for
this
great
affliction
when
does
the
train
start
for
memphis
seven
o
clock
in
the
morning
replied
the
agent
alas
that
would
be
too
late
all
will
be
over
before
then
was
my
reply
i
believe
said
the
agent
that
under
the
circumstances
the
superintendent
would
let
you
have
an
extra
train
for
a
reasonable
compensation
i
will
ask
him
by
telegraph
if
you
wish
you
are
very
kind
sir
and
i
thank
you
please
make
the
request
without
delay
tell
the
superintendent
that
money
is
no
object
the
value
of
the
engine
and
coach
is
offered
and
will
be
promptly
paid
if
required
i
beg
you
sir
not
to
lose
a
moment
if
you
only
knew
how
precious
time
is
to
me
now
you
would
be
in
a
hurry
while
i
was
urging
the
agent
to
send
the
message
the
clicking
of
the
instrument
under
his
thumb
and
finger
indicated
the
fact
that
the
electric
fluid
was
dashing
the
request
into
the
office
at
memphis
the
dispatch
was
gone
in
three
minutes
a
short
conversation
was
then
commenced
between
the
superintendent
at
memphis
and
the
agent
at
grenada
as
the
clicking
of
the
instrument
carried
the
words
to
the
ear
of
the
operator
he
conveyed
them
to
my
ear
by
word
of
mouth
is
number
seven
there
inquired
the
superintendent

the

to
a
little
negro
who

dozing
near
the
door
the
little
fellow
rose
up
shook
himself
rubbed
his
eyes
with
his
sleeve
gaped
and
staggered
up
against
the
wall
and
said
sir
the
order
was
quickly
repeated
and
the
boy
walked
leisurely
away
it
was
but
a
few
minutes
until
a
little
man
with
long
black
whiskers
and
large
expressive
eyes
entered
the
office
his
garments
were
covered
with
grease
and
smut
and
his
hands
were
thrust
deep
down
in
his
pockets
and
a
don
sort
of
expression
was
visible
on
his
face
is
number
seven

good
running

steelbrim
inquired
the
operator
hunkadory

replied
by
the

floor

left

inches

as

the
operator
repeated
this
order
to
me
hope
which
i
thought
had
died
within
me
began
to
revive
a
glimmering
hope
it
was
indeed
yet
it
was
a
live
hope
that
i
should
once
more
gaze
on
those
pretty
blue
eyes
before
death
set
his
cold
seal
on
them
forever
i
hurriedly

silence
a
dim

gloomy
appearance
over

chapter
xxvii
miss
kate
darlington
was
the
only
daughter
of
thaddeus
darlington
a
real
yankee
who
had
imbibed
all
those
unreasonable
prejudices
prevailing
in
the
new
england
states
against
all
citizens
of
the
south
he
had
been
sent
south
by
the
government
to
look
after
some
defaulting
revenue
collectors
and
after
discharging
that
duty
he
concluded
to
locate
in
jackson
mississippi
his
daughter
kate
had
received
a
polished
education
but
she
had
been
petted
and
flattered
until
she
was
pretty
well
spoiled
her
disposition
was
gentle
and
kind
when
things
went
smoothly
but
she
had
a
temper
which
often
got
the
upper
hand
and
then
she
usually
made
matters
rather
unpleasant
after
the
maskers
had
dispersed
miss
darlington
stole
away
from
the
crowd
and
took
a
seat
behind
the
ladies
cabin
in
order
to
have
what
she
called
a
day
dream
a
sentiment
of
a
mysterious
nature
had
of
late
been
disturbing
her
mind
a
strange
feeling
not
altogether
painful
and
not
entirely
pleasant
a
kind
of
joyful
pain
a
happy
sorrow
a
pleasant
fear
what
is
the
matter
with
me
was
the
question
she
asked
herself
what
sort
of
a
pain
is
this
that
is
mixed
with
delicious
pleasure
how
strange
that
such
joy
can
be
concealed
under
such
misery
while
she
was
thus
soliloquizing
the
image
of
a
man
would
every
now
and
then
pass
across
the
path
of
her
imagination
she
could
see
the
image
plainer
when
her
eyes
were
shut
than
with
them
open
and
despite
her
efforts
to
drive
it
away
it
would
keep
thrusting
itself
before
her
sometimes
in
one
shape
then
in
another
but
always
with
the
same
look
the
same
form
that
shape
was
the
exact
counterpart
of
the
gallant
sir
knight
of
ivanhoe
yes
it
is
so
i
am
captured
at
last
it
is
love
heigh
ho
there
is
no
use
to
struggle
any
longer
what
will
dear
papa
say
when
he
finds
that
i
have
fallen
in
love
with
a
real
double
and
twisted
rebel
a
man
who
fought
through
four
years
of
bloody
war
against
the
union
a
downright
traitor
who
brags
of
the
part
he
played
in
the
rebel
army
ah
me
how
strange
it
is
that
i
should
fall
in
love
with
such
a
man
but
didn
t
juliet
fall
in
love
with
a
son
of
her
father
s
bitterest
enemy
yes
but
alas
what
a
tragic
ending
did
that
love
produce
something
tells
me
that
this
love
will
end
in
sorrow
but
stop
a
moment
why
should
papa
be
ralleigh
s
enemy
why
should
i
not
love
captain
burk
he
fought
for
his
country
he
fought
in
he
battled
for
his
life
his
liberty
his
home
his
mother
and
his
sisters
he
would
have
been
less
than
a
man
if
he
had
refused
to
fight
it
would
have
been
cowardly
no
he
was
right
and
i
honor
him
for
it
i
love
captain
burk
papa
will
love
him
when
he
knows
him
better
i
ought
to
be
proud
that
such
a
man
as
captain
burk
has
honored
me
with
his
love
i
am
proud
of
it
i
will
reciprocate
his
love
and
if
papa
is
willing
i
will
be
the
wife
of
what
my
people
have
misnamed
a
traitor
ah
me
there
is
the
rub
papa
will
raise
a
great
row
when
he
knows
how
i
love
a
scottie
then
took
out
her
handkerchief
and
wiped
away
the
tears
that
were
stealing
down
her
cheeks
a
gentleman
is
looking
for
you
miss
said
a
who
came
through
the
back
door
and
approached
her
who
is
it
i
believe
they
call
him
divinghoe
or
hivanhoe
or
some
such
outlandish
where
is
he
he
is
in
the
front
part
of
the
saloon
he
sent
me
to
hunt
very
well
you
may
tell
him
where
i
am
if
you
but
a
moment
elapsed
before
ivanhoe
was
by
scottie
s
side
i
have
been
looking
all
over
the
boat
for
you
scottie
what
induced
you
to
hide
from
me
i
did
not
hide
from
you
particularly
but
i
felt
sad
and
wanted
to
be
i
hope
you
will
not
be
so
cruel
as
to
drive
me
away
when
you
know
how
it
pleases
me
to
be
by
your
side
oh
no
i
have
had
my
little
day
dream
and
am
glad
you
thank
you
can
we
have
a
little
chat
here
without
being
interrupted
yes
i
guess
so
take
a
i
have
made
another
wonderful
what
is
it
we
have
got
a
counterfeit
emperor
aboard
of
this
what
do
you
mean
the
real
napoleon
has
slipped
out
of
his
costume
and
a
counterfeit
has
slipped
in
to
be
plain
a
stranger
got
aboard
somewhere
and
is
dressed
in
napoleon
s
costume
and
the
real
napoleon
has
vamoosed
the
ranch
run
away
disappeared
melted
into
thin
air
fell
overboard
become
extinct
or
something
of
the
sort
anyway
the
original
emperor
is
not
comeatible
now
scottie
i
should
like
to
know
what
you
think
of
such
doings
i
will
tell
you
in
short
what
i
think
we
are
all
struggling
in
a
sea
of
nonsense
and
i
am
heartily
ashamed
of
my
part
of
it
i
wish
i
were
at
my
father
s
house
that
i
do
and
if
things
don
t
change
pretty
soon
i
shall
set
my
sails
in
that
direction
napoleon
is
not
the
only
one
who
has
been
playing
tricks
on
this
boat
captain
quitman
ought
not
to
permit
such
how
did
you
get
possession
of
the
information
i
had
had
many
conversations
with
the
original
navarre
one
subject
in
particular
had
been
frequently
discussed
between
us
a
while
ago
i
walked
up
and
took
navarre
s
arm
and
began
to
talk
about
the
special
subject
he
was
startled
when
i
took
his
arm
and
i
could
feel
his
body
trembling
after
i
had
gone
on
talking
for
about
five
minutes
he
gave
a
grunt
like
a
wild
hog
and
abruptly
walked
away
leaving
me
thunderstruck
with
astonishment
i
then
discovered
that
he
was
not
the
real
now
scottie
if
i
had
been
present
when
that
scamp
had
the
impudence
to
grunt
at
you
i
think
i
should
have
broken
his
head
with
my
i
am
very
glad
then
you
were
not
present
because
i
am
on
grant
s
platform
let
us
have
peace
is
a
very
good
thing
in
its
proper
place
but
i
feel
very
much
inclined
to
get
up
a
row
here
i
think
i
shall
commit
some
sort
of
mischief
if
these
things
don
t
change
very
soon
the
fact
is
we
may
look
out
for
squalls
some
sort
of
deviltry
is
brewing
aboard
of
this
boat
i
am
of
that
opinion
myself
but
i
think
we
had
better
have
nothing
to
do
with
that
woman
in
the
black
domino
keeps
me
on
the
rack
all
the
time
and
i
would
not
be
at
all
surprised
if
it
should
turn
out
that
she
is
at
the
bottom
of
all
this
mysterious
suppose
we
change
the
subject
and
let
the
black
domino
and
her
work
out
their
own
very
good
what
shall
we
talk
about
oh
anything
for
a
what
book
is
that
you
hold
in
your
hand
paradise
i
would
rather
see
paradise
found
but
how
do
you
like
milton
too
much
imagination
and
not
enough
sentiment
such
extravagant
ideas
just
think
of
his
description
of
the
war
in
heaven
he
says
they
plucked
up
great
mountains
by
the
roots
and
threw
them
at
each
other
s
heads
now
i
think
that
is
a
little
too
if
you
like
sentiment
you
admire
tom
ah
you
are
right
as
to
that
give
me
moore
and
burns
above
all
others
i
often
steal
away
when
at
home
and
weep
over
the
sweet
sentimental
songs
of
those
favorite
shakespeare
is
my
poet
speaking
of
sentiment
it
gushes
up
on
every
page
and
streams
from
every
line
rosalind
imogene
juliet
romeo
orlando
and
hamlet
all
are
made
to
utter
the
most
sentiment
but
enough
about
poetry
take
my
arm
and
let
us
go
on
deck
and
enjoy
the
as
soon
as
they
reached
the
upper
deck
george
iii
came
up
with
a
look
of
mystery
on
his
countenance
good
morning
i
was
wanting
to
speak
a
few
words
with
you
perhaps
you
have
heard
of
my
great
mishap
no
what
is
it
my
watch
was
stolen
from
my
pocket
within
the
last
thirty
ah
ha
exclaimed
scottie
i
told
you
so
the
whirlwind
has
started
and
a
tornado
will
wind
up
the
have
you
any
idea
who
was
the
thief
yes
but
my
suspicions
may
not
be
well
may
i
know
whom
you
suspect
inquired
ivanhoe
yes
provided
you
will
promise
not
to
mention
it
to
any
good
i
promise
of
so
do
i
said
scottie
my
suspicions
point
to
that
man
who
appears
in
napoleon
s
dress
and
mask
though
he
is
a
why
not
make
the
charge
boldly
and
demand
the
right
to
make
a
search
for
the
watch
said
ivanhoe
let
us
wait
and
watch
him
for
he
is
bent
on
mischief
and
we
will
catch
him
in
the
act
of
picking
some
man
s
i
beg
pardon
gentlemen
said
an
old
man
with
long
white
whiskers
as
he
bowed
very
low
to
ivanhoe
and
george
iii
he
was
the
same
gentleman
who
had
been
so
often
seen
with
the
lady
in
the
black
domino
leaning
on
his
arm
i
have
a
communication
to
make
which
i
consider
of
some
importance
the
fact
is
matters
are
becoming
somewhat
complicated
on
this
boat
and
if
i
might
be
so
bold
as
to
offer
advice
i
should
say
that
it
is
high
time
for
all
these
young
people
to
lay
aside
their
masks
wolves
have
managed
to
get
into
the
flock
and
mischief
will
be
done
if
matters
go
on
in
this
way
much
longer
a
lady
aboard
of
this
boat
whose
name
i
am
not
at
liberty
to
mention
has
made
a
startling
disclosure
to
me
which
portends
some
dire
mischief
the
fact
is
i
am
constrained
to
believe
from
what
she
told
that
murder
is
may
we
know
the
particulars
of
course
yes
that
is
the
very
matter
i
wish
to
communicate
if
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
request
ingomar
to
join
us
i
would
be
much
obliged
as
i
think
he
ought
to
hear
what
i
have
to
ivanhoe
went
after
ingomar
and
soon
returned
accompanied
by
him
the
young
lady
to
whose
sagacity
i
am
indebted
for
the
important
information
which
i
am
about
to
communicate
has
a
history
yes
a
very
strange
history
full
of
queer
incidents
such
as
you
see
in
novels
the
young
lady
to
whom
i
refer
is
the
one
in
the
black
domino
you
have
often
seen
her
leaning
on
my
arm
gentlemen
she
is
a
most
elegant
young
lady
of
remarkable
beauty
and
superior
intellect
whose
protector
i
have
the
honor
to
be
at
this
time
a
combination
of
sad
circumstances
unfortunate
events
i
might
say
have
clouded
her
young
life
you
may
perhaps
have
noticed
that
she
has
not
participated
in
any
of
the
amusements
in
which
the
young
people
have
been
indulging
on
this
boat
if
i
were
at
liberty
to
reveal
the
secrets
of
her
unhappy
life
i
could
unfold
a
most
distressing
story
but
that
is
a
sealed
book
so
far
as
we
are
concerned
you
have
probably
noticed
a
disposition
on
the
part
of
this
young
lady
to
wander
about
alone
seeking
solitude
where
she
could
give
free
vent
to
her
grief
and
let
her
tears
flow
unnoticed
by
the
unsympathizing
crowd
well
i
did
not
approve
of
this
course
but
was
unable
to
prevent
it
and
perhaps
after
all
it
was
fortunate
that
i
did
not
stop
it
for
it
was
during
one
of
these
solitary
rambles
that
the
information
which
i
am
going
to
communicate
was
obtained
she
had
concealed
herself
on
the
larboard
side
of
the
boat
just
in
front
of
the
and
behind
a
stack
of
furniture
where
she
could
meditate
alone
when
two
men
came
out
and
stood
on
the
other
side
and
held
a
consultation
in
very
low
tones
she
could
not
hear
every
word
that
was
said
but
what
she
did
hear
was
of
a
most
startling
character
as
soon
as
the
two
men
stepped
into
the
saloon
the
young
lady
came
and
immediately
imparted
to
me
what
she
had
heard
to
say
i
was
surprised
would
not
convey
the
full
meaning
of
what
i
felt
the
fact
is
i
was
shocked
startled
paralyzed
with
astonishment
yes
gentlemen
it
is
most
wonderful
i
might
say
diabolical
i
can
repeat
word
for
word
all
that
the
young
lady
heard
which
i
mean
to
do
it
was
unfortunate
however
that
she
did
not
see
the
two
men
that
is
she
did
not
get
a
full
view
of
them
but
she
saw
the
head
and
shoulders
of
one
of
the
men
as
he
passed
through
the
door
and
she
thinks
she
knows
who
he
is
but
for
fear
that
she
might
be
mistaken
as
to
that
she
requested
me
not
to
mention
the
name
of
the
man
she
suspects
which
request
i
of
course
must
respect
now
here
is
the
conversation
verbatim
as
it
was
related
to
me
by
this
unfortunate
young
lady
he
is
the
man
beyond
question
said
the
first
speaker
yes
that
s
certain
replied
number
two
he
has
lots
of
greenbacks
says
number
one
we
must
have
his
money
and
his
life
too
we
must
first
get
his
money
and
then
settle
the
other
do
you
know
how
much
money
he
has
no
but
it
is
way
up
in
the
thousands
and
i
think
i
may
say
tens
of
good
that
s
lucky
but
have
you
matured
any
plan
to
crib
the
game
then
they
began
to
talk
in
a
whisper
and
the
young
lady
could
not
hear
all
that
was
said
but
ever
and
anon
she
could
catch
a
word
such
as
throttle
him
chuck
him
overboard
dead
men
keep
secrets
revenge
old
grudge
he
ruined
me
money
good
revenge
better
could
steal
his
money
but
rather
have
his
then
they
whispered
for
a
long
time
in
tones
so
low
that
the
young
lady
could
not
hear
what
was
said
now
gentlemen
i
guess
you
will
indorse
me
when
i
say
it
is
diabolical
who
is
to
be
the
victim
who
is
to
be
chucked
overboard
that
is
the
question
gentlemen
it
may
be
you
or
you
or
you
or
it
may
be
me
what
s
to
be
done
that
s
the
question
i
put
shall
we
sit
still
and
wait
for
the
catastrophe
or
shall
we
go
to
work
and
prevent
it
i
can
answer
for
one
said
scottie
in
a
tone
of
firmness
as
she
rose
from
her
seat
i
shall
leave
this
boat
as
soon
as
we
reach
vicksburg
and
make
my
way
to
my
father
s
house
at
jackson
mississippi
i
wash
my
hands
of
this
if
scottie
leaves
the
boat
at
vicksburg
observed
ivanhoe
i
am
inclined
to
the
opinion
that
another
passenger
will
feel
it
his
duty
to
fall
back
i
ll
fight
it
out
on
this
line
if
it
takes
all
summer
said
george
iii
as
he
walked
round
describing
a
circle
of
fifteen
feet
the
man
who
chucks
me
overboard
shall
go
along
with
me
and
who
robs
me
of
my
purse
only
cheats
himself
and
does
not
make
me
poor
indeed
because
that
has
already
been
done
long
long
a
man
would
be
an
expert
pickpocket
indeed
who
could
steal
a
purse
from
me
said
ivanhoe
i
have
had
no
use
for
an
article
of
that
sort
for
many
years
scottie
can
testify
i
don
t
suppose
you
have
had
any
use
for
a
purse
since
confederate
money
went
down
replied
scottie
i
think
we
had
better
consult
captain
quitman
about
this
matter
suggested
ingomar
certainly
sir
i
agree
with
you
there
observed
the
old
gentleman
with
the
white
whiskers
and
if
you
will
wait
a
moment
i
will
bring
him
captain
quitman
soon
appeared
accompanied
by
the
old
gentleman
well
said
the
captain
what
s
the
question
to
be
discussed
the
old
man
related
in
a
rambling
manner
what
the
young
lady
in
the
black
domino
had
heard
when
he
had
finished
the
narrative
he
began
to
stroke
his
long
white
whiskers
with
his
left
hand
what
do
you
think
of
that
sir
yes
yes
that
s
the
question
captain
quitman
what
do
you
think
of
that
sir
gammon
sir
all
gammon
muttered
the
captain
as
he
lighted
a
fresh
cigar
and
began
to
puff
the
smoke
in
clouds
above
the
old
gentleman
s
head
gammon
gammon
zounds
sir
do
you
apply
that
epithet
to
the
young
lady
who
has
the
honor
to
be
under
my
protection
i
mean
the
young
lady
whom
i
have
the
honor
to
protect
the
old
gentleman
locked
his
hands
under
the
tail
of
his
coat
and
began
to
prance
around
at
a
rapid
rate
gammon
i
think
you
said
gammon
sir
what
in
the
deuce
do
you
mean
by
gammon
sir
do
you
know
the
meaning
of
the
word
sir
i
ask
you
that
sir
do
you
know
sir
that
gammon
and
humbug
mean
the
same
thing
why
didn
t
you
say
the
young
lady
was
a
humbug
sir
in
plain
terms
answer
me
that
sir
i
ll
have
you
understand
sir
that
this
young
lady
is
no
humbug
she
is
not
gammon
either
sir
if
you
call
this
unhappy
young
lady
a
humbug
sir
you
shall
answer
for
it
yes
answer
for
it
is
that
plain
enough
for
you
sir
i
beg
pardon
sir
said
captain
quitman
politely
you
have
entirely
misunderstood
me
my
good
friend
i
had
no
allusion
to
the
young
lady
when
i
made
the
remark
i
assure
you
i
am
convinced
that
the
young
lady
heard
just
what
she
stated
but
i
was
inclined
to
think
that
the
conversation
she
heard
was
gammon
or
humbug
if
you
please
i
infer
that
the
conversation
alluded
to
something
that
had
occurred
not
to
a
plan
for
future
you
did
not
mean
to
apply
the
word
gammon
to
the
young
lady
then
certainly
not
certainly
not
i
had
no
thought
of
such
a
then
sir
there
s
my
hand
i
forgive
you
sir
with
all
my
heart
i
am
a
peaceable
man
fact
is
sir
i
never
get
excited
i
am
slow
to
anger
i
love
peace
but
despise
the
word
gammon
i
don
t
think
such
an
odious
word
should
ever
be
used
i
had
an
uncle
once
who
committed
suicide
under
circumstances
of
the
most
distressing
character
my
uncle
was
a
very
handsome
young
man
everybody
said
he
resembled
me
he
was
a
very
sensitive
melancholy
man
had
a
fashion
of
looking
on
the
dark
side
of
everything
the
fact
is
my
uncle
was
an
unhappy
young
man
he
fell
in
love
with
a
beautiful
young
widow
and
for
a
long
time
he
tried
to
muster
up
courage
to
ask
her
to
marry
him
but
it
was
postponed
from
month
to
month
until
another
man
entered
the
lists
to
contend
for
the
fair
prize
at
first
the
beautiful
widow
was
rather
favorably
inclined
toward
my
uncle
time
went
on
my
uncle
went
on
too
so
did
the
beautiful
widow
after
so
long
a
time
my
uncle
at
last
in
a
fit
of
desperation
asked
the
beautiful
widow
to
marry
him
what
do
you
think
was
her
reply
sir
why
sir
she
looked
him
full
in
the
face
and
sneeringly
said
gammon
the
next
morning
my
uncle
s
remains
were
found
in
a
briar
patch
with
a
bullet
hole
through
his
head
and
on
a
sheet
of
paper
which
he
held
clinched
in
his
fist
appeared
the
odious
word
gammon
in
large
letters
made
in
red
ink
now
sir
you
will
readily
understand
why
i
was
displeased
when
you
used
that
word
just
ah
sir
i
again
most
humbly
ask
your
pardon
i
certainly
did
not
mean
to
use
the
word
as
in
any
way
applicable
to
you
or
the
young
again
sir
i
offer
you
my
hand
but
i
fear
you
do
not
attach
as
much
importance
to
what
the
young
lady
heard
as
you
should
in
fact
sir
i
think
you
are
mistaken
when
you
conclude
that
the
conversation
referred
to
something
which
had
transpired
at
some
previous
i
am
inclined
to
agree
with
this
gentleman
s
views
observed
george
because
part
of
the
conversation
evidently
referred
to
some
one
on
this
boat
who
was
to
be
the
victim
by
the
by
had
you
heard
that
my
watch
was
snatched
from
my
pocket
but
an
hour
ago
ha
is
that
so
exclaimed
captain
quitman
who
for
the
first
time
began
to
look
serious
this
indeed
is
news
to
me
it
must
be
looked
into
whom
do
you
suspect
the
man
wearing
the
mask
and
uniform
of
napoleon
there
are
three
men
on
this
boat
wearing
costumes
that
were
worn
by
other
men
when
we
left
i
must
confess
that
this
information
surprises
me
this
conduct
looks
suspicious
something
must
be
i
think
all
masks
should
at
once
be
discarded
observed
the
old
gentleman
and
i
had
advised
that
course
before
you
came
no
no
said
captain
quitman
that
would
prevent
us
from
catching
the
thieves
i
think
i
can
suggest
a
better
plan
in
fact
i
believe
we
can
manage
to
capture
the
rascals
if
my
plan
is
adopted
we
will
employ
some
one
to
watch
the
three
suspicious
men
meantime
don
t
mention
this
matter
to
any
one
just
let
me
manage
the
case
i
ll
place
guards
on
all
parts
of
the
boat
both
day
and
night
with
instructions
to
keep
an
eye
on
those
three
men
let
the
amusements
proceed
as
if
nothing
had
happened
mention
the
matter
to
no
one
and
i
ll
vouch
for
the
result
i
have
a
man
on
board
who
was
in
the
detective
service
many
years
i
ll
put
him
on
their
tracks
your
watch
shall
be
found
if
the
matter
is
left
to
me
if
not
you
shall
be
paid
for
your
plan
sir
is
evidently
the
best
under
the
circumstances
said
ingomar
because
if
we
unmask
now
that
would
enable
the
thieves
to
evade
detection
let
the
young
lady
in
the
black
domino
understand
that
she
is
not
to
tell
any
one
about
what
she
do
you
remember
the
number
of
your
watch
inquired
captain
quitman
addressing
george
iii
what
is
its
value
i
don

where
did
you
purchase
it
i
i
that
is
i
ah
hem
i
didn
t
buy

from
deceased
relations
then
how
in
the
deuce
did
you
come
by
it
i
borrowed
it
from
a
ha
ha
ha
laughed
the
jolly
old
captain
that
makes
the
loss
a
more
serious
one
but
never
mind
you
shall
have
your
watch
again
soon
or
cash
enough
to
satisfy
your
but
suppose
those
suspicious
individuals
should
try
to
leave
the
boat
said
the
old
gentleman
with
the
white
whiskers
i
shall
instruct
the
guards
to
arrest
them
and
compel
them
to
unmask
and
submit
to
a
search
whenever
they
attempt
to
leave

you
had
better
not
seek
to
know
my
thoughts
just
now
for
they
are
not
of
a
very
pleasant
nature
however
one
idea
has
found
its
way
into
my
scanty
brain
which
i
have
no
objection
to
your
let
me
have
it

any
little
idea
of
yours

acceptable

an
old
fool
there
now
you

got
at
least
one
idea

very
bright
little

chapter
xxviii
a
great
change
was
perceptible
among
the
merry
maskers
when
they
had
in
obedience
to
the
orders
of
the
queen
the
different
members
of
the
party
dropped
in
one
at
a
time
taking
their
seats
in
silence
one
circumstance
happened
which
created
some
little
excitement
and
no
little
curiosity
henry
of
navarre
who
had
kept
away
from
the
party
up
to
this
time
came
forward
and
bowing
very
low
to
the
queen
asked
permission
to
join
the
party
to
hear
the
story
as
navarre
made
his
request
she
gave
a
sudden
start
as
if
the
sound
of
the
voice
had
frightened
her
and
a
perceptible
tremor
was
discernible
in
her
tone
as
she
requested
him
to
be
seated
napoleon
instead
of
taking
his
seat
near
the
queen
took
up
his
position
by
the
corner
of
the
pilot
house
some
distance
from
the
spot
occupied
by
the
other
maskers
one
of
the
party
called
to
him
and
requested
him
to
take
his
place
he
shook
his
head
but
made
no
reply
and
the
queen
commanded
ingomar
to
proceed
my
good
friends
i
am
now
about
to
reach
that
part
of
my
story
which
gives
me
more
pain
than
pleasure
to
relate
in
fact
i
may
venture
to
say
that
it
will
be
all
pain
and
no
pleasure
i
would
gladly
skip
over
a
portion
of
the
story
but
that
would
leave
a
gap
which
would
show
an
unfinished
job
there
is
one
circumstance
in
this
connection
which
i
consider
it
to
be
my
duty
to
mention
during
all
my
sufferings
there
was
a
sustaining
influence
that
held
me
up
an
invisible
indescribable
presence
all
the
time
with
me
that
kept
me
from
dying
with
despair
that
most
potent
influence
was
secured
by
humble
devout
sincere
secret
prayer
coupled
with
an
unswerving
determination
to
discharge
my
whole
duty
under
all
circumstances
this
strange
influence
seemed
to
surround
me
on
all
occasions
and
it
enabled
me
to
keep
my
head
above
the
huge
waves
of
trouble
that
were
dashing
against
me
with
great
fury
to
be
plain
i
put
my
trust
in
god
and
he
did
not
forsake
me
some
people
would
be
disposed
to
sneer
at
sentiments
of
this
character
in
fact
i
have
often
heard
such
sentiments
ridiculed
and
i
have
as
often
known
men
to
change
from
the
one
extreme
to
the
other
i
knew
a
young
man
in
memphis
a
few
years
ago
who
had
occasion
to
change
his
views
the
change
was
brought
about
in
a
most
singular
manner
the
young
man
was
assisting
some
workmen
to
cover
a
very
tall
house
situated
on
shelby
street
a
conversation
had
been
going
on
for
some
time
among
the
laborers
on
the
questions
connected
with
the
future
state
the
young
man
seemed
to
be
the
leader
in
the
conversation
i
don
t
believe
that
god
answers
prayers
said
he
i
don
t
believe
he
pays
any
attention
to
the
concerns
of
men
i
never
prayed
in
my
life
and
i
am
healthy
and
happy
i
think
it
is
simple
in
a
man
to
ask
god
for
anything
he
knows
what
we
want
and
if
he
wishes
us
to
have
it
he
will
give
it
to
us
without
our
as
he
uttered
the
last
word
his
feet
slipped
from
under
him
and
he
fell
at
full
length
on
his
back
the
north
side
of
the
roof
was
covered
with
a
white
frost
which
caused
the
young
man
s
feet
to
slip
the
building
was
three
stories
high
and
from
the
ground
to
the
eaves
was
nearly
forty
feet
the
young
man
was
standing
near
the
top
of
the
roof
and
as
he
uttered
the
sentence
he
stepped
over
on
the
north
side
to
get
a
hammer
that
he
had
left
there
when
he
fell
flat
on
his
back
his
body
darted
toward
the
edge
of
the
roof
like
a
lump
of
ice
gliding
down
the
mountain
side
at
the
very
brink
of
the
roof
a
nail
caught
in
his
clothes
and
stopped
him
his
legs
were
hanging
over
the
edge
while
his
body
lay
back
on
the
shingles
the
ground
near
the
foundation
of
the
house
was
covered
with
innumerable
large
stones
with
hundreds
of
sharp
corners
and
edges
which
every
one
knew
would
cause
the
young
man
s
death
if
he
fell
on
them
there
the
man
s
body
swung
forty
feet
above
the
ground
only
held
by
a
little
number
four
nail
the
slightest
movement
might
send
his
soul
across
the
dark
river
i
have
heard
many
people
pray
but
such
a
prayer
as
that
young
man
uttered
then
and
there
i
have
never
heard
before
or
since
the
most
solemn
promises
of
reformation
were
made
the
most
earnest
appeals
to
god
for
help
a
ladder
was
quickly
brought
from
an
adjoining
hook
and
ladder
company
s
quarters
and
the
young
man
was
saved
if
any
of
my
friends
have
a
desire
to
know
the
name
of
this
young
man
go
to
all
the
churches
in
memphis
and
hear
all
the
christians
pray
then
select
the
one
that
prays
longest
and
loudest
that
s
he
but
i
crave
your
pardon
my
friends
for
this
digression
and
will
return
to
my
story
we
left
grenada
at
sharp
the
night
was
unusually
dark
heavy
clouds
overspread
the
horizon
and
a
steady
patter
of
could
be
heard
falling
against
the
windows
of
the
coach
harry
and
myself
were
the
only
occupants
and
the
train
consisted
of
the
engine
tender
and
a
single
car
in
which
we
rode
occasionally
i
would
hoist
the
sash
of
the
window
in
order
to
let
the
cold
damp
atmosphere
cool
my
burning
cheeks
for
i
felt
as
if
my
blood
were
boiling
hot
as
the
of
the
engine
cast
its
bright
rays
on
the
trees
along
the
road
i
could
see
that
we
were
dashing
on
with
lightning
speed
i
occupied
a
seat
on
the
left
side
of
the
coach
while
harry
sat
on
the
right
and
immediately
opposite
the
one
where
i
was
when
the
windows
were
all
down
there
was
an
overpowering
feeling
of
suffocation
that
was
unbearable
and
when
they
were
up
the
wind
came
dashing
in
accompanied
by
streams
of
rain
i
would
close
the
window
and
endure
the
oppressive
closeness
as
long
as
i
could
then
hoist
the
sash
again
letting
the
wind
and
rain
pour
in
until
my
face
would
be
cooled
i
had
borrowed
harry
s
watch
and
sat
with
it
open
in
my
hand
counting
every
second
of
time
which
seemed
to
linger
unusually
long
a
mental
question
kept
presenting
itself
to
my
mind
will
i
ever
see
lottie
again
will
she
be
dead
before
i
get
there
what
is
to
be
my
fate
in
the
future
can
i
consent
to
drag
out
a
long
miserable
existence
after
my
darling
has
gone
to
heaven
i
made
a
solemn
vow
to
god
that
i
would
not
rebel
against
his
will
but
that
i
would
humbly
submit
to
and
bear
without
complaint
such
punishment
as
he
in
his
great
wisdom
might
send
upon
me
i
earnestly
begged
for
lottie
s
life
no
one
ever
prayed
more
humbly
and
sincerely
than
i
did
on
that
occasion
and
i
believe
harry
did
the
same
though
he
sat
silently
in
his
seat
apparently
buried
in
his
own
sad
thoughts
sometimes
he
would
turn
his
face
toward
me
and
point
to
the
watch
which
i
held
in
my
hand
this
i
understood
to
be
an
inquiry
as
to
the
time
the
only
answer
i
made
was
to
hold
the
watch
close
to
his
eyes
he
would
glare
at
it
then
lean
back
in
his
seat
without
uttering
a
word
every
now
and
then
the
wind
would
dash
in
through
the
window
scattering
the
falling
rain
over
my
face
causing
the
lamp
to
flare
up
and
spatter
then
for
an
instant
the
feeble
light
would
flicker
and
struggle
as
if
in
the
last
agonies
of
dissolution
after
an
unusual
gust
had
dashed
in
bringing
with
it
a
copious
shower
of
rain
i
was
compelled
to
close
the
window
to
prevent
the
lamp
from
being
totally
extinguished
as
soon
as
i
had
excluded
the
air
the
same
feeling
of
suffocation
that
had
annoyed
me
so
often
came
upon
me
with
redoubled
severity
i
could
not
get
enough
air
into
my
lungs
notwithstanding
i
was
struggling
to
do
so
i
felt
as
i
suppose
one
feels
when
dying
in
fact
i
do
not
believe
that
the
actual
pains
of
dissolution
could
have
increased
my
sufferings
harry
made
a
sign
signifying
a
wish
to
know
the
time
i
managed
to
hold
the
face
of
the
watch
so
he
could
see
it
he
whispered
as
he
leaned
back
in
his
seat
and
closed
his
eyes
the
lamp
now
began
to
sing
and
sputter
spitting
the
oil
up
through
the
chimney
making
a
dozen
different
sounds
it
would
dart
a
bright
blaze
nearly
to
the
top
of
the
chimney
then
sink
down
so
low
that
no
light
could
be
seen
it
would
whine
like
a
young
child
then
sing
at
times
it
would
sputter
then
pop
pop
pop
like
the
cracking
of
a
small
whip
anon
it
would
whistle
and
blaze
up
casting
a
dazzling
light
all
over
the
seats
then
drop
back
to
its
usual
dim
dimensions
after
it
had
performed
a
dozen
such
strange
freaks
it
gave
one
long
shriek
and
suddenly
expired
we
were
left
in
total
darkness
a
darkness
as
black
as
blindness
itself
a
ton
s
weight
seemed
to
be
pressing
on
my
breast
i
felt
that
my
last
moment
had
come
i
sank
down
on
the
seat
without
the
strength
to
hold
up
my
head
i
was
in
a
swoon
the
first
sensation
i
experienced
after
my
reason
returned
was
that
of
the
most
delicious
pleasure
the
strangest
but
most
exquisite
feeling
of
happiness
seemed
to
steal
over
me
the
most
mysterious
influence
appeared
to
surround
me
the
smothering
sensation
was
gone
and
a
delightful
absence
of
pain
was
in
its
stead
and
at
once
the
coach
seemed
to
be
filled
with
the
most
delicious
perfume
such
as
i
had
so
often
enjoyed
while
with
lottie
in
her
flower
garden
what
does
it
mean
i
asked
myself
how
could
the
coach
be
filled
with
such
delightful
odor
when
all
the
windows
were
closed
harry
what
in
heaven
s
good
name
does
this
mean
i
at
last
managed
to
ask
hush
ed
he
whispered
some
one
is
in
this
coach
it
is
a
lady
i
felt
her
skirts
brush
past
my
knees
lottie
i
exclaimed
as
i
sprang
to
my
feet
what
do
you
mean
whispered
harry
as
he
caught
me
by
the
arm
while
he
was
trembling
like
one
in
an
ague
fit
lottie
darling
is
it
you
i
gasped
while
harry
still
held
me
by
the
arm
are
you
mad
he
exclaimed
as
he
closed
his
fingers
about
my
arm
why
do
you
call
lottie
don
t
you
know
she
is
dying
in
memphis
she
was
here
this
very
moment
i
felt
her
skirt
brush
my
knee
and
i
believe
she
called
my
name
i
replied
nonsense
i
think
there
s
a
lady
in
this
coach
she
passed
me
a
moment
ago
i
distinctly
felt
her
skirts
brush
against
my
knees
as
she
went
down
the
upon
my
honor
i
thought
i
heard
lottie
call
my
pshaw
edward
of
course
that
is
all
imagination
and
i
beg
you
not
to
talk
so
i
suspect
that
some
one
is
trying
to
steal
a
ride
i
am
sure
there
is
some
one
in
this
coach
besides
you
and
me
try
to
calm
yourself
what
makes
you
tremble
that
way
it
is
yourself
who
is
trembling
let
go
my
arm
you
are
hurting
it
i
declare
you
are
shaking
as
if
you
had
an
ague
fit
yes
and
your
hand
is
as
cold
as
hark
what
was
that
did
you
hear
anything
no
but
as
i
live
i
felt
some
one
brush
past
so
did
i
and
it
was
a
female
beyond
all
doubt
for
i
felt
her
skirts
touch
me
as
she
passed
just
as
i
did
a
moment
yes
and
i
distinctly
felt
something
tickle
my
left
cheek
it
was
the
same
feeling
i
had
so
often
experienced
when
lottie
was
near
me
and
a
stray
lock
of
hair
would
touch
my
i
declare
this
is
the
strangest
mystery
that
i
ever
heard
of
give
me
a
match
and
let
me
relight
the
lamp
so
we
can
see
who
it
i
have
not
got
a
match
you
will
have
to
go
and
request
the
fireman
to
come
and
light
it
pray
do
so
at
once
for
this
darkness
is
as
soon
as
harry
went
out
to
bring
the
fireman
i
again
felt
something
softly
passing
across
my
cheek
i
threw
out
my
arms
expecting
to
catch
the
living
body
of
some
person
but
not
so
i
caught
nothing
as
i
turned
round
i
felt
the
same
touch
on
my
right
cheek
it
might
have
been
imagination
but
i
thought
i
again
heard
lottie
calling
my
name
the
truth
is
i
was
so
much
overcome
with
excitement
that
i
scarcely
knew
what
was
going
on
around
me
harry
was
out
but
a
few
moments
returning
accompanied
by
the
fireman
who
immediately
lighted
the
lamp
we
procured
a
lantern
and
began
to
search
for
the
mysterious
passenger
we
carefully
examined
every
seat
looking
under
each
bench
but
could
find
nobody
we
went
out
and
examined
the
rear
platform
thinking
that
probably
some
one
might
be
stealing
a
ride
but
nothing
of
the
sort
was
to
be
seen
i
became
perfectly
convinced
that
no
one
was
concealed
either
in
or
outside
of
the
coach
i
was
overwhelmed
with
astonishment
at
the
singular
mystery
when
i
told
harry
what
had
occurred
during
the
time
he
was
gone
after
the
fireman
informing
him
that
i
thought
i
heard
lottie
s
voice
distinctly
call
my
name
he
fixed
his
eyes
upon
my
face
and
gazed
steadily
for
a
moment
as
if
to
satisfy
himself
that
i
had
not
gone
mad
ed
said
he
your
mind
has
been
taxed
too
heavily
of
late
i
think
it
is
quite
unsettled
i
do
not
believe
you
ever
were
inclined
to
be
no
said
i
superstition
has
never
been
classed
among
my
many
faults
but
on
this
occasion
i
must
confess
that
i
am
unable
to
tell
exactly
what
i
do
think
it
may
be
as
you
say
that
sorrow
has
to
some
extent
unsettled
my
mind
but
nevertheless
i
am
sure
i
heard
some
one
call
my
name
with
a
voice
i
could
recognize
among
ten
thousand
my
telegram
will
be
answered
the
answer
will
meet
us
at
sardis
it
will
bring
news
of
lottie
s
death
it
will
tell
us
that
she
died
at
you
will
remember
that
was
the
exact
time
when
the
coach
was
filled
with
the
delicious
fragrance
that
was
the
very
moment
when
the
lamp
died
and
then
it
was
that
we
felt
the
skirts
of
a
lady
s
dress
brush
past
us
harry
our
darling
is
dead
and
as
sure
as
we
live
her
sweet
spirit
was
with
us
here
in
this
oh
edward
don
t
talk
that
way
i
beseech
you
i
declare
you
frighten
me
you
are
as
pale
as
a
ghost
sit
down
and
try
to
be
calm
you
will
regret
this
language
when
you
get
over
the
i
leaned
back
on
the
seat
closed
my
eyes
and
endeavored
to
analyze
the
mysterious
occurrences
that
had
just
happened
but
the
more
i
thought
of
the
matter
the
more
unsettled
became
my
mind
and
i
began
to
try
to
fix
my
thoughts
on
other
objects
but
all
seemed
confusion
and
mystery
harry
settled
himself
down
on
the
cushion
and
leaned
his
head
on
the
back
of
the
seat
closed
his
eyes
and
silently
communed
with
his
own
thoughts
not
another
word
was
uttered
by
either
of
us
until
the
train
drew
up
in
front
of
the
hotel
at
sardis
a
considerable
crowd
of
people
began
to
collect
about
the
spot
having
been
somewhat
surprised
no
doubt
at
the
arrival
of
a
train
at
that
unusual
time
every
now
and
then
a
man
s
head
would
be
thrust
in
at
the
door
then
suddenly
withdrawn
it
was
but
a
few
seconds
after
the
train
had
halted
when
steelbrim
poked
his
head
in
at
the
door
and
holding
an
envelope
in
his
hand
said
a
telegram
for
edward
my
hands
trembled
so
that
i
could
scarcely
open
the
envelope
but
at
length
i
did
and
read
as
follows
memphis
my
dear
boy
trust
in
god
he
will
sustain
you
all
is
over
lottie
died
at
her
last
words
were
love
messages
to
you
she
expired
with
your
picture
in
her
hand
while
it
was
moist
with
her
kisses
don
t
let
this
awful
blow
crush
you
remember
that
you
can
go
to
her
if
she
can
not
come
to
you
rely
on
him
who
alone
can
give
you
comfort
now
her
last
moments
were
free
from
pain
and
she
was
not
alarmed
at
the
approach
of
death
her
mind
was
clear
to
the
last
we
know
her
pure
soul
is
now
in
heaven
god
grant
my
dear
boy
that
we
may
meet
our
darling
there
the
funeral
will
take
place
at
on
evening
a
carriage
will
meet
you
at
the
depot
it
is
just
as
i
told
you
harry
i
said
as
i
handed
him
the
dispatch
and
fell
back
on
my
seat
i
did
not
faint
i
did
not
even
groan
because
i
was
prepared
for
the
awful
blow
i
felt
as
if
some
strong
man
held
my
throat
in
an
iron
grip
and
that
the
breath
was
being
choked
out
of
me
i
pushed
the
sash
up
and
let
the
wind
and
rain
pour
in
on
my
hot
brow
while
i
was
struggling
to
fill
my
lungs
as
soon
as
harry
finished
reading
the
dispatch
he
let
it
fall
to
the
floor
and
his
body
went
down
with
it
i
saw
him
fall
but
i
was
unable
to
go
to
his
assistance
in
fact
i
never
thought
of
offering
aid
i
was
thinking
of
my
own
grief
chapter
xxix
being
so
completely
prostrated
by
the
great
mountain
of
grief
that
pressed
heavily
on
my
sad
heart
i
failed
to
notice
the
condition
of
harry
wallingford
whose
upturned
face
had
put
on
a
expression
it
was
after
several
minutes
had
elapsed
that
i
happened
to
look
at
him
i
was
considerably
frightened
when
i
beheld
the
features
i
ascertained
upon
examination
that
he
had
fainted
and
also
discovered
a
stream
of
blood
flowing
from
his
left
temple
that
came
from
an
ugly
wound
caused
by
striking
his
head
against
the
sharp
corner
of
the
seat
as
he
fell
i
dashed
some
cold
water
in
his
face
then
lifted
him
from
the
floor
and
laid
him
on
the
seat
watching
eagerly
for
signs
of
returning
life
which
i
was
gratified
to
see
very
soon
fixing
his
eyes
on
me
with
a
wild
restless
expression
he
said
is
is
true
that
lottie
is
dead
how
can
you
gaze
on
me
with
such
a
look
of
affection
ed
when
you
know
that
by
your
kindness
you
are
heaping
coals
of
living
fire
on
my
unworthy
head
if
you
would
abuse
me
curse
me
spit
on
me
spurn
me
or
do
anything
to
show
that
you
despise
me
i
could
bear
it
but
to
receive
disinterested
kindness
from
one
that
i
have
so
deeply
wronged
is
a
greater
punishment
than
humanity
can
endure
you
must
remember
that
i
have
murdered
lottie
yes
i
have
closed
those
pretty
blue
eyes
forever
i
have
pushed
her
fair
body
into
the
grave
i
have
invited
the
worms
to
banquet
on
her
queenly
form
i
slapped
you
in
the
face
i
drove
viola
to
desperation
and
caused
her
to
murder
her
little
brother
and
yet
i
am
unhung
and
you
can
look
kindly
on
me
what
kind
of
man
are
you
what
sort
of
a
heart
is
yours
why
do
you
not
plunge
a
dagger
into
my
breast
well
i
suppose
you
think
that
you
can
kill
me
with
kindness
as
well
as
any
other
way
and
in
that
you
are
very
correct
when
i
am
dead
i
want
you
to
continue
your
kindness
until
you
see
my
remains
deposited
by
the
side
of
my
murdered
sister
i
know
i
don
t
deserve
such
honor
but
i
may
rely
on
your
goodness
to
have
my
last
request
complied
the
strangeness
of
his
conduct
the
mystery
of
his
language
had
a
tendency
to
add
to
the
great
waves
of
misery
that
were
rolling
over
me
for
i
inferred
that
he
was
contemplating
suicide
for
full
thirty
minutes
he
continued
to
rave
about
innumerable
blunders
that
he
accused
himself
of
having
committed
and
i
positively
assert
that
no
prosecuting
attorney
could
have
given
such
an
offensive
coloring
to
willful
and
malicious
murder
as
he
gave
to
the
cause
of
lottie
s
death
all
of
which
he
declared
had
been
produced
by
himself
i
ventured
to
discuss
the
matter
with
him
as
soon
as
i
regained
sufficient
to
enable
me
to
do
it
hoping
to
lead
his
mind
away
from
the
subject
of
lottie
s
death
but
it
was
like
the
blind
trying
to
lead
the
blind
while
i
was
endeavoring
to
console
harry
wallingford
i
stood
as
much
in
need
of
it
as
he
did
nevertheless
i
put
forth
my
utmost
efforts
to
soothe
him
i
was
somewhat
surprised
when
the
train
came
to
a
sudden
halt
in
front
of
the
hernando
station
steelbrim
thrust
his
smutty
head
into
the
front
door
and
said
by
jing
we
made
the
best
time
on
record
the
old
gal
is
in
a
splendid
humor
made
a
mile
a
minit
from
sardis
here
and
i
bet
she
could
distance
a
streak
of
greased
lightning
from
here
to
memphis
if
i
had
a
track
from
here
to
the
moon
i
could
make
the
old
gal
climb
the
grade
in
time
to
make
the
connection
we
are
now
three
minits
ahead
of
time
and
according
to
orders
we
must
not
move
a
peg
till
time
is
then
he
turned
round
and
addressed
the
fireman
feed
the
old
gal
a
little
smutty
and
ile
her
j
ints
good
for
i
m
gwine
to
let
her
rip
from
here
to
memphis
she
ll
make
it
in
minits
like
a
top
the
old
gal
knows
me
and
she
allers
makes
up
her
mind
for
business
when
this
chap
holds
the
throttle
tom
scratchler
undertook
to
manage
her
t
other
day
but
she
took
the
dumps
and
wouldn
t
run
worth
a
cent
but
it
takes
me
to
hold
her
down
to
wait
a
moment
steelbrim
said
the
telegraph
operator
a
dispatch
is
coming
for
edward
all
hunkadory
replied
the
eccentric
little
engineer
plenty
of
time
and
if
necessary
i
can
persuade
the
old
gal
to
put
in
a
few
extra
the
rain
had
ceased
and
the
dark
clouds
began
to
move
rapidly
northward
the
moon
that
had
been
obscured
emerged
from
behind
them
casting
a
bright
cheerful
light
over
the
earth
here
we
are
demar
exclaimed
steelbrim
as
he
came
in
and
handed
me
the
telegram
i
tossed
it
down
on
the
seat
not
caring
to
read
any
news
since
lottie
was
dead
in
fact
i
felt
a
peculiar
hatred
against
all
telegraph
lines
and
more
especially
against
the
one
that
had
brought
me
the
fatal
news
steelbrim
started
his
engine
forward
with
such
a
sudden
plunge
that
it
threw
me
to
the
third
seat
behind
where
i
was
standing
pitching
me
head
foremost
against
the
slightly
bruising
my
head
i
think
the
effect
of
the
shock
was
beneficial
for
it
seemed
to
relieve
the
smothering
sensation
which
had
afflicted
me
for
some
time
seating
myself
where
i
could
watch
wallingford
for
i
was
afraid
he
meditated
i
began
to
conjecture
in
regard
to
the
contents
of
the
envelope
that
lay
on
the
seat
just
in
front
of
me
and
as
is
usual
in
such
cases
never
guessed
anywhere
near
the
truth
i
might
have
gone
on
conjecturing
for
a
hundred
years
and
i
dare
say
i
never
would
have
made
the
right
guess
as
to
the
purport
of
the
message
after
taxing
my
mind
in
that
way
for
five
minutes
i
have
hit
the
mark
at
last
i
muttered
to
myself
the
sheriff
will
let
miss
bramlett
attend
lottie
s
having
satisfied
myself
that
i
had
at
last
made
the
proper
guess
i
took
the
envelope
tore
it
open
and
held
it
carelessly
for
some
time
before
i
commenced
reading
it
i
have
that
particular
telegram
here
in
my
bosom
and
i
have
no
doubt
my
friends
would
like
to
hear
it
read
i
had
often
heard
men
say
that
the
danger
of
death
being
caused
by
good
news
was
equal
to
that
produced
by
bad
but
i
never
did
credit
any
such
notions
until
after
i
received
that
dispatch
i
am
now
a
full
believer
in
the
idea
that
death
could
be
and
doubtless
has
often
been
produced
by
the
sudden
shock
occasioned
by
the
reception
of
unexpected
good
news
but
let
me
read
you
the
telegram
memphis
bless
god
my
dear
boy
a
wonderful
miracle
has
been
wrought
medical
science
is
all
a
humbug
a
bauble
a
farce
nonsense
moonshine
the
profession
all
bosh
i
would
not
give
a
nickel
for
any
man
s
opinion
i
never
will
give
another
opinion
don
t
ever
ask
me
for
an
opinion
i
won
t
give
it
i
telegraphed
you
minutes
ago
that
lottie
was
dead
i
thought
she
was
dead
we
all
thought
so
medical
science
pronounced
her
dead
if
i
had
not
the
evidence
of
my
own
eyes
to
the
contrary
i
should
continue
to
say
she
was
dead
but
when
i
see
those
pretty
eyes
watching
me
i
am
forced
to
halt
lottie
is
alive
and
says
she
is
not
going
to
die
plaxico
says
she
will
not
die
and
if
i
had
not
vowed
never
to
give
another
opinion
i
should
say
so
too
plaxico
says
she
was
in
a
trance
sometimes
called
an
ecstasy
a
sort
of
suspended
animation
i
say
she
was
dead
he
says
he
has
seen
many
such
cases
i
say
gammon
though
bear
in
mind
i
venture
no
opinion
if
the
mississippi
river
were
to
commence
running
north
it
would
not
surprise
me
fact
is
nothing
could
surprise
me
after
what
i
have
seen
lottie
talks
very
strangely
says
she
was
with
you
on
the
train
what
does
it
all
mean
plaxico
contends
that
the
soul
was
temporarily
released
from
the
body
i
say
bosh
lottie
is
much
better
mind
clear
pulse
regular
respiration
good
symptoms
all
favorable
no
pain
bless
god
my
boy
but
don
t
construe
this
as
an
opinion
from
me
be
cautious
when
you
arrive
lottie
must
be
prepared
to
receive
you
the
slightest
shock
might
prove
fatal
will
meet
you
at
front
gate
and
advise
you
how
to
act
get
control
of
your
feelings
before
you
see
lottie
perhaps
a
man
possessed
of
a
vivid
imagination
might
work
his
mind
up
to
a
point
where
he
could
make
a
pretty
fair
guess
as
to
the
joy
that
came
to
my
crushed
heart
when
i
read
that
dispatch
but
i
know
that
no
eloquent
writer
could
set
down
anything
approaching
a
correct
description
of
it
it
would
not
be
an
exaggeration
to
say
that
i
was
for
a
moment
paralyzed
with
the
excess
of
joy
i
did
not
shout
scream
or
move
but
stood
like
one
who
had
been
stunned
by
a
heavy
blow
while
i
held
my
hand
over
my
heart
pressing
it
very
hard
in
order
to
still
its
violent
throbbing
as
soon
as
i
recovered
sufficiently
to
enable
me
to
speak
calmly
i
called
to
wallingford
who
was
sitting
there
with
his
eyes
closed
looking
more
like
a
block
of
white
marble
than
a
man
are
you
asleep
harry
i
inquired
as
i
laid
my
hand
on
his
shoulder
he
gave
a
sudden
start
then
gazed
a
moment
at
me
how
can
i
sleep
when
the
hot
flames
of
torment
are
blazing
in
my
bosom
never
shall
i
sleep
any
more
i
have
murdered
sleep
and
my
sweet
sister
too
my
career
will
soon
be
closed
and
the
world
will
be
rid
of
the
vilest
wretch
that
ever
dwelt
in
it
harry
do
you
believe
that
any
man
could
be
killed
with
good
news
no
of
course
not
but
why
do
you
ask
me
such
a
question
because
it
is
in
my
power
to
impart
to
you
some
of
the
best
news
that
ever
was
poured
into
the
ears
of
mortal
man
edward
he
groaned
you
must
not
try
to
console
me
with
false
hopes
you
had
better
leave
me
to
endure
my
just
punishment
it
is
the
will
of
god
that
i
should
suffer
and
i
do
not
complain
you
could
not
tell
me
anything
in
the
shape
of
news
that
would
relieve
me
except
it
was
to
let
me
know
that
my
darling
sister
lived
and
the
guilt
of
murder
was
not
on
my
wicked
that
is
the
very
thing
i
am
prepared
to
what
in
heaven
s
name
do
you
mean
be
perfectly
quiet
and
i
will
explain
could
you
calmly
listen
to
the
news
of
lottie
being
alive
certainly
i
could
because
it
would
not
be
true
and
i
must
request
you
not
to
torture
me
in
this
did
you
ever
hear
of
a
person
being
in
a
trance
when
the
friends
thought
it
was
death
yes
very
often
doctor
plaxico
told
me
that
such
things
frequently
occurred
he
mentioned
two
cases
that
had
come
under
his
then
why
might
we
not
hope
that
such
was
lottie
s
condition
when
doctor
dodson
telegraphed
us
that
she
was
dead
edward
pray
tell
me
what
you
mean
exactly
what
i
say
now
stop
harry
don
t
lose
control
of
edward
you
must
not
trifle
with
my
i
do
not
mean
to
trifle
with
your
feelings
but
i
must
request
you
to
control
them
do
you
think
you
can
do
it
yes
yes
pray
go
well
in
the
first
place
lottie
is
not
dead
and
in
the
second
place
she
is
much
better
and
in
the
third
place
she
is
going
to
recover
now
come
you
promised
to
be
calm
remember
i
hold
you
to
your
promise
i
will
read
you
the
telegram
if
you
will
sit
down
and
be
perfectly
quiet
if
you
do
not
i
shall
not
let
you
see
or
hear
what
are
you
talking
about
am
i
not
calm
you
don
t
expect
me
not
to
tremble
do
you
there
now
just
sit
perfectly
still
and
hear
the
good
he
at
last
fell
back
on
the
seat
and
listened
to
the
reading
of
the
telegram
while
his
eyes
were
closed
and
his
hands
tightly
clasped
across
his
breast
when
i
had
finished
reading
i
knelt
down
by
his
seat
and
whispered
kneel
down
harry
now
is
the
very
time
to
offer
he
fell
on
his
knees
in
an
instant
and
remained
there
a
long
time
and
when
he
got
up
there
was
a
look
of
inexpressible
joy
on
his
countenance
i
was
satisfied
that
he
was
safe
and
then
i
was
happy
too
eddie
he
said
after
remaining
silent
for
a
few
minutes
apparently
soliloquizing
if
god
spares
lottie
s
life
i
will
love
and
worship
him
as
long
as
i
indeed
we
should
feel
very
grateful
to
him
for
such
a
great
blessing
i
replied
what
is
the
time
he
inquired
as
he
saw
me
looking
at
the
watch
was
the
reply
we
will
soon
see
our
darling
but
we
must
remember
doctor
dodson
s
instructions
do
you
think
you
will
be
able
to
command
your
feelings
i
believe
i
will
but
it
will
cost
a
desperate
we
must
remember
what
is
at
stake
and
not
forget
ourselves
when
the
critical
moment
i
think
you
may
depend
on
me
now
you
know
how
much
misery
has
resulted
from
my
rashness
and
i
have
had
a
severe
but
i
hope
a
useful
harry
i
have
always
believed
that
experiential
lessons
were
the
only
ones
of
much
i
dare
say
you
are
correct
in
that
belief
i
have
reasons
to
hope
that
the
sad
lessons
taught
me
by
experience
will
make
a
better
man
of
the
shriek
of
the
locomotive
announced
our
arrival
as
the
train
dashed
into
the
station
at
memphis
we
found
the
carriage
waiting
for
us
when
we
stepped
on
the
platform
how
is
she
i
inquired
eagerly
as
i
grasped
the
hand
of
the
old
negro
coachman
better
much
better
sir
thank
god
we
hope
she
will
recover
go
as
fast
as
you
can
i
said
as
we
entered
the
carriage
the
faithful
old
negro
seemed
to
appreciate
the
situation
for
he
took
us
over
the
road
at
the
rate
of
twenty
miles
an
hour
the
few
pedestrians
who
were
on
the
streets
at
that
late
hour
stopped
and
stared
at
the
carriage
as
it
whirled
past
them
as
if
they
thought
the
horses
were
running
away
some
one
will
be
killed
certain
said
a
man
who
stood
gazing
with
wonder
as
we
dashed
by
him
many
heads
were
thrust
out
of
the
windows
the
owners
of
said
heads
seemed
to
have
been
startled
from
pleasant
dreams
by
the
rattling
of
the
wheels
on
the
pavement
within
two
minutes
from
the
time
we
started
from
the
depot
i
was
in
the
arms
of
dodson
my
good
mother
she
had
been
watching
at
the
front
gate
for
our
arrival
she
kissed
my
lips
my
cheeks
my
brow
my
temples
and
did
not
slight
my
nose
ah
ha
here
we
come
my
boy
exclaimed
doctor
dodson
as
he
snatched
me
from
his
wife
s
arms
get
out
of
my
way

t

boy

t

think
i
want
to
hug
the
boy
too
ah
ha
here
we
then
he
made
a
grab
at
my
body
and
jerked
me
against
his
breast
and
squeezed
me
as
hard
as
a
polar
bear
could
have
done
ah
ha
my
boy
all
s
well
that
ends
well
you
know
yes
we
will
all
be
happy
yet
but
don
t
construe
this
as
an
expression
of
my
opinion
by
any
means
i
don
t
express
my
opinion
on
any
subject
while
doctor
and
dodson
were
paying
their
respects
to
me
rockland
was
weeping
on
harry
s
breast
and
rockland
who
rarely
ever
suffered
anything
to
disturb
his
equanimity
was
jumping
around
trying
to
get
hold
of
harry
how
is
my
darling
i
inquired
as
soon
as
i
could
release
myself
from
doctor
dodson
s
embrace
better
much
better
my
boy
thank
heaven
let
me
see
her
instantly
i
can
not
wait
a
moment
longer
i
am
dying
to
hold
her
in
my
arms
we
were
at
the
front
gate
some
distance
from
the
house
ah

my
boy

with
him
if
he
thinks
there
is
no
risk
you
shall
see
her
ah
ha
that
you
shall
my
boy
let
her
sleep
though
she
must
not
be
disturbed
until
she
awakes
take
your
boots
off
when
you
get
to
the
house
my
boy
dolly
will
get
you
a
pair
of
slippers
caution
my
boy
caution
you
see
the
necessity
of
it
don
t
you
my
boy
yes
of
course
you
do
ah
ha
here
we
come
in
pursuance
of
instructions
i
took
off
my
boots
and
thrust
my
feet
into
a
pair
of
cloth
slippers
which
dodson
handed
to
me
as
we
entered
the
front
portico
rockland
furnished
harry
with
a
pair
of
the
same
sort
and
the
movements
of
all
showed
how
they
loved
the
angelic
creature
whose
life
was
trembling
in
the
balance
doctor
dodson
whispered
a
few
words
to
me
then
went
into
lottie
s
room
and
soon
returned
accompanied
by
doctor
plaxico
how
is
she
now
doctor
i
inquired
oh
she
is
all
right
now
sir
i
think
she
will
come
round
handsomely
she
is
sleeping
quite
soundly
pulse
greatly
improved
respiration
can
we
see
her
now
i
eagerly
demanded
yes
certainly
provided
you
obey
instructions
to
the
very
letter
only
one
of
you
can
go
in
at
a
time
and
you
must
not
speak
to
or
touch
her
but
if
you
have
the
slightest
doubt
as
to
your
ability
to
control
your
feelings
you
had
better
not
go
you
go
in
first
said
i
to
harry
no
edward
i
yield
to
you
it
is
your
privilege
to
see
her
first
go
in
and
give
me
time
to
get
my
feelings
under
it
was
his
generous
heart
that
prompted
him
to
give
me
the
preference
come
with
me
said
plaxico
as
he
took
hold
of
my
arm
i
can
not
trust
you
alone
when
so
much
depends
on
your
as
soon
as
i
passed
through
the
half
open
door
i
encountered
the
same
sweet
scent
of
flowers
that
had
so
strangely
come
into
the
coach
between
sardis
and
grenada
i
recognized
it
instantly
there
was
no
mistaking
the
delicious
fragrance
the
carpet
was
covered
with
fresh
flowers
the
mantel
was
loaded
with
them
two
large
bouquets
lay
on
the
cover
of
the
bed
there
lay
my
darling
pale
but
beautiful
still
her
eyes
and
lips
were
closed
and
the
long
pretty
lashes
fell
over
her
eyes
concealing
them
from
my
view
i
approached
the
bedside
silently
and
fell
on
my
knees
near
the
beautiful
patient
i
could
hear
the
gentle
breathing
and
see
the
regular
rise
and
fall
of
her
bosom
as
her
sweet
breath
fanned
my
cheeks
and
it
taxed
my
strength
to
its
utmost
capacity
to
keep
from
touching
her
doctor
plaxico
doubtless
fearing
that
i
might
be
unable
to
control
myself
stood
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
bed
so
as
to
be
in
front
of
me
with
his
finger
raised
by
way
of
cautioning
me
to
be
quiet
the
bed
on
which
the
pretty
sleeper
reposed
was
near
the
center
of
the
room
a
low
french
bedstead
and
her
arms
were
resting
above
the
white
counterpane
that
covered
it
occasionally
a
sweet
smile
would
light
up
her
pale
beautiful
face
and
i
could
hear
her
whispering
my
name
she
is
dreaming
about
you
now
demar
whispered
plaxico
as
he
put
his
mouth
close
to
my
ear
she
appears
to
be
thinking
of
you
all
the
time
both
when
asleep
and
awake
she
holds
your
picture
in
her
hand
constantly
and
i
do
not
believe
any
one
could
steal
it
from
her
without
awaking
placing
my
ear
close
to
her
lips
in
order
to
hear
what
she
was
saying
my
long
whiskers
happened
to
touch
her
chin
when
her
body
instantly
began
to
tremble
violently
edward
is
coming
home
mother
she
whispered
was
it
a
sin
to
worship
that
charming
girl
who
dreamed
of
me
while
asleep
and
loved
and
prayed
for
me
when
awake
if
it
was
then
you
may
set
me
down
as
a
very
great
sinner
for
i
did
worship
her
with
a
devotion
as
fervent
and
sincere
as
that
with
which
any
heathen
ever
worshiped
his
god
you
must
retire
now
demar
whispered
the
doctor
as
i
think
there
is
danger
of
her
being
disturbed
for
you
do
not
seem
to
have
control
of
your
feelings
refreshing
sleep
is
what
she
needs
most
just
now
it
is
the
best
restorative
in
cases
of
this
sort
and
it
would
be
very
unfortunate
if
you
should
happen
to
disturb
i
reluctantly
obeyed
his
command
and
withdrew
to
the
parlor
accompanied
by
him
how
is
my
dear
sister
now
doctor
eagerly
exclaimed
harry
as
he
met
us
at
the
door
every
symptom
appears
to
be
favorable
the
physician
replied
she
is
sleeping
quite
soundly
and
her
fever
is
entirely
gone
pulse
greatly
improved
but
we
must
be
extremely
cautious
not
to
give
her
a
sudden
shock
when
she
when
can
i
see
her
i
will
let
you
go
in
any
moment
when
you
are
sure
that
you
can
govern
yourself
completely
for
you
shall
promise
me
not
to
touch
or
speak
to
your
i
make
the
promise
now
and
beg
you
to
let
me
see
plaxico
took
his
arm
and
led
him
into
lottie
s
room
and
at
the
end
of
five
minutes
he
returned
and
sinking
down
on
the
sofa
buried
his
face
in
his
mother
s
bosom
and
burst
into
tears
weep
my
dear
son
said
rockland
as
she
pressed
him
to
her
heart
it
will
do
you
good
i
often
find
relief
in
tears
when
sorrow
weighs
heavily
upon
my
dear
good
mother
he
exclaimed
as
he
threw
his
arms
around
her
neck
can
you
ever
love
me
again
after
i
have
caused
you
so
many
hours
of
sorrow
love
you
my
son
nothing
could
deprive
you
of
my
love
you
have
erred
but
you
were
deceived
by
a
combination
of
circumstances
that
would
have
misled
any
mother
can
you
forgive
me
there
is
nothing
to
pardon
my
son
you
thought
your
sister
was
betrayed
and
that
it
was
your
duty
to
defend
her
you
acted
upon
what
appeared
to
be
proof
and
not
from
an
evil
doctor
plaxico
took
a
seat
near
me
and
requested
rockland
to
go
into
lottie
s
room
and
keep
watch
until
the
patient
should
wake
i
then
gave
the
doctor
a
detailed
history
of
the
strange
events
that
happened
on
the
train
and
requested
him
to
give
me
the
benefit
of
his
opinion
on
the
subject
ah
demar
said
he
if
you
follow
the
profession
as
long
as
i
have
you
will
encounter
many
curious
things
this
is
the
third
case
of
the
same
sort
that
i
have
treated
i
was
not
here
when
dodson
telegraphed
you
that
she
was
dead
of
course
i
should
have
prevented
it
dodson
s
heart
is
too
large
it
gets
away
with
his
judgment
miss
wallingford
was
merely
in
a
short
trance
a
fortunate
thing
too
by
the
by
that
was
one
of
nature
s
scientific
plans
adopted
to
cure
the
patient
and
i
think
it
has
succeeded
the
authorities
differ
as
to
the
causes
of
such
a
condition
and
many
different
theories
have
been
advanced
on
the
subject
but
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
nothing
satisfactory
has
been
developed
i
am
decidedly
inclined
to
the
views
of
the
minority
who
think
that
the
soul
for
the
time
being
is
absolutely
out
of
the
body
you
say
that
miss
wallingford
was
with
you
on
the
train
at
exactly
i
believe
it
too
for
that
was
the
very
moment
when
she
fell
into
the
trance
now
if
the
soul
was
temporarily
released
from
the
body
where
would
it
be
most
likely
to
go
of
course
to
where
her
affections
led
to
the
man
of
whom
she
had
been
thinking
all
the
time
if
my
theory
is
not
correct
your
imagination
was
at
fault
and
you
were
mistaken
in
your
belief
the
fact
is
demar
the
more
we
study
and
theorize
on
this
subject
the
more
complicated
it
seems
i
often
rack
my
brain
about
the
matter
until
it
all
ends
in
confusion
god
was
the
artist
who
made
the
wonderful
machine
called
man
and
he
crammed
him
full
of
mystery
eccentricities
and
unaccountable
things
well
demar
the
best
way
to
secure
true
happiness
is
to
fear
god
and
keep
his
commandments
and
let
him
run
the
machine
in
his
own
way
what
is
is
and
that
s
all
we
know
about
it
we
don
t
know
the
cause
of
things
and
the
less
we
puzzle
our
brains
about
it
the
better
for
us
but
let
me
tell
you
demar
you
ought
to
worship
god
day
and
night
as
long
as
you
live
what
have
you
ever
done
for
him
by
way
of
compensation
for
what
he
has
done
for
you
he
made
miss
wallingford
she
is
the
paragon
of
beauty
and
loveliness
an
angel
in
disposition
and
then
he
made
her
fall
in
love
with
you
that
is
more
than
you
deserve
more
than
any
sinner
i
know
it
doctor
and
i
acknowledge
my
obligation
and
have
resolved
never
to
forget
excuse
me
demar
i
must
now
go
and
see
my
patient
i
will
return
after
lottie
had
slept
three
hours
doctor
plaxico
consented
for
me
to
go
into
her
room
again
i
think
she
will
wake
very
soon
said
he
and
you
had
better
be
present
then
you
must
be
very
cautious
and
not
exhibit
any
unusual
emotion
remember
she
is
in
a
critical
condition
and
the
slightest
shock
might
prove
fatal
and
govern
yourself
accordingly
at
first
i
thought
that
probably
it
would
be
better
to
let
some
one
break
the
news
of
your
arrival
to
her
before
letting
her
see
you
but
upon
second
thought
i
have
concluded
to
allow
you
to
be
present
when
she
awakes
place
yourself
near
the
bed
take
hold
of
her
hand
press
it
gently
and
remain
very
quiet
be
sure
you
do
not
make
any
demonstrations
when
you
see
her
eyes
this
was
a
hard
command
but
i
made
up
my
mind
to
obey
it
believing
as
i
did
that
it
was
wisely
given
kneeling
down
near
the
bed
i
took
her
left
hand
in
mine
pressing
it
gently
to
my
lips
when
she
instantly
commenced
to
roll
her
head
from
one
side
to
the
other
let
go
her
hand
quick
the
doctor
whispered
i
obeyed
instantly
but
was
puzzled
to
know
his
reasons
for
giving
such
an
order
plaxico
stood
with
his
finger
on
his
mouth
which
i
understood
to
be
a
command
for
me
to
maintain
silence
any
one
might
have
heard
the
throbbing
of
my
heart
across
the
room
while
every
nerve
in
my
body
was
quivering
violently
now
take
hold
of
her
hand
again
and
be
careful
to
remain
the
very
instant
my
hand
touched
hers
she
again
began
to
tremble
raising
her
other
hand
she
commenced
to
pass
it
round
as
if
searching
for
something
while
her
lips
were
continually
moving
and
every
now
and
then
i
distinctly
heard
my
name
pronounced
i
was
informed
by
the
doctor
that
she
was
under
the
influence
of
a
very
strong
opiate
which
i
suppose
accounted
for
the
apparent
uneasiness
of
her
slumber
five
minutes
perhaps
had
elapsed
after
i
took
hold
of
her
hand
the
second
time
when
she
touched
my
cheek
then
running
her
fingers
among
my
whiskers
she
began
to
pat
me
on
the
face
at
length
her
eyes
flew
open
and
after
gazing
at
me
for
a
moment
in
a
bewildered
way
she
laid
her
right
arm
around
my
neck
drew
my
head
down
on
the
pillow
close
to
her
cheek
and
whispered
in
my
ear
many
sweet
expressions
of
affection
there
were
no
evidences
of
violent
emotion
or
extravagant
outbursts
of
excitement
but
her
voice
sounded
like
the
cooing
of
a
dove
my
face
was
moistened
with
the
tears
that
streamed
from
her
eyes
but
they
were
tears
of
unmixed
joy
i
thought
they
had
killed
my
hero
she
whispered
as
she
drew
her
arm
closer
about
my
neck
i
have
been
very
unjust
to
my
poor
brother
but
i
thought
he
and
heartsell
had
murdered
you
and
you
must
bring
him
here
so
i
can
ask
him
to
pardon
me
i
was
with
you
and
my
brother
on
the
train
last
night
and
tried
to
speak
to
you
but
could
not
make
you
hear
me
our
mother
was
with
me
and
she
says
that
she
is
our
guardian
angel
commissioned
to
watch
over
us
she
was
such
a
beautiful
angel
too
i
never
beheld
anything
so
miss
wallingford
said
doctor
plaxico
i
think
it
would
be
very
imprudent
for
you
to
talk
any
more
just
i
would
not
venture
to
disobey
a
peremptory
order
of
yours
doctor
but
i
believe
that
a
conversation
with
harry
and
edward
would
do
me
more
good
now
than
any
medicine
you
could
give
me
let
me
see
my
dear
brother
immediately
and
then
you
may
demand
i
had
better
grant
your
request
than
to
raise
a
row
by
refusing
observed
the
doctor
as
he
went
to
bring
wallingford
in
when
harry
entered
the
room
i
could
see
that
he
was
making
a
vigorous
effort
to
restrain
his
great
emotions
sinking
down
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
bed
he
allowed
his
sister
to
embrace
him
brother
dear
whispered
lottie
can
you
forgive
the
great
wrong
i
have
done
by
my
unjust
suspicions
against
you
ah
my
darling
sister
it
is
i
who
ought
to
sue
for
pardon
because
if
i
had
heeded
your
advice
all
this
sorrow
might
have
been
prevented
if
you
only
will
get
well
and
love
me
in
the
future
as
you
have
in
the
past
i
shall
yet
be
happy
let
us
endeavor
to
eradicate
from
our
memory
the
sad
occurrences
of
the
past
and
i
solemnly
promise
never
again
to
set
up
my
judgment
against
oh
my
good
brother
how
happy
you
have
made
me
i
soon
shall
be
well
again
i
thought
at
one
time
that
i
could
leave
this
world
without
regret
but
it
is
different
with
me
now
i
do
not
want
to
die
because
i
have
something
worth
living
now
miss
wallingford
said
plaxico
i
must
positively
drive
these
two
gentlemen
out
of
the
room
unless
you
will
agree
to
be
perfectly
i
will
make
any
promise
in
the
bounds
of
reason
if
you
will
let
them
remain
with
very
well
they
may
stay
if
you
will
harry
held
her
right
hand
and
i
her
left
while
i
drank
deep
draughts
of
love
from
the
dear
eyes
that
were
gazing
up
into
my
own
who
can
describe
the
inexpressible
joy
that
one
feels
when
he
knows
himself
to
be
the
exclusive
owner
of
such
a
heart
as
the
one
that
throbbed
in
the
breast
of
lottie
wallingford
it
would
be
extreme
folly
on
my
part
to
attempt
to
convey
to
my
audience
a
description
of
the
great
happiness
i
enjoyed
then
my
heart
was
almost
drowned
with
the
excess
of
delight
chapter
xxx
for
three
days
after
harry
and
i
had
arrived
at
home
scarcely
any
change
was
perceptible
in
lottie
s
condition
except
an
inclination
to
sleep
all
the
time
which
plaxico
contended
was
most
favorable
this
conjecture
proved
correct
for
at
the
end
of
ten
days
her
condition
was
so
much
improved
that
he
pronounced
her
entirely
out
of
danger
good
nursing
is
all
she
needs
now
said
he
i
never
left
the
premises
until
i
was
satisfied
that
all
danger
was
over
and
i
did
not
go
then
of
my
own
accord
lottie
ordered
me
to
go
and
see
viola
and
to
carry
a
hamper
basket
full
of
fresh
flowers
that
she
had
caused
to
be
gathered
for
her
tell
viola
that
as
soon
as
i
am
able
to
ride
in
the
carriage
i
will
come
to
see
her
ask
her
if
she
wants
anything
and
tell
her
that
she
must
be
of
good
cheer
and
we
will
defeat
the
enemy
yet
now
do
your
best
to
encourage
the
poor
thing
and
assure
her
that
i
will
soon
be
with
her
to
stay
all
the
lottie
you
don
t
think
of
going
back
to
stay
in
jail
again
do
you
certainly
i
do
why
not
people
will
talk
you
let
them
talk
as
much
as
they
please
god
has
spared
my
life
in
order
that
i
might
save
my
dear
friend
and
i
mean
to
do
it
eddie
do
you
still
doubt
me
can
you
trust
me
i
did
not
make
any
answer
because
i
was
bewildered
and
did
not
know
what
to
say
hence
i
abruptly
left
the
room
to
carry
the
flowers
and
message
as
directed
when
i
entered
viola
s
cell
i
was
shocked
at
her
appearance
there
was
a
look
of
hopeless
despair
settled
on
her
face
and
her
cheeks
were
bloodless
and
deadly
pale
she
was
dressed
in
plain
black
silk
without
ornaments
her
pale
face
brightened
up
when
i
entered
and
she
rose
to
meet
me
holding
out
her
hand
for
me
to
take
when
i
delivered
the
flowers
and
lottie
s
kind
message
telling
her
that
lottie
was
out
of
all
danger
she
burst
into
tears
and
sank
down
on
the
sofa
after
a
while
she
brushed
the
tears
away
and
said
pardon
me
demar
this
flow
of
tears
has
relieved
my
aching
heart
god
has
answered
my
prayers
when
i
had
lost
all
hope
oh
sir
if
you
knew
how
i
have
prayed
for
dear
lottie
s
life
you
would
better
understand
my
love
for
her
take
a
seat
demar
and
tell
me
about
your
late
i
complied
with
her
request
by
giving
her
a
detailed
history
of
the
unfortunate
occurrences
that
had
kept
me
away
from
home
you
now
know
from
experience
demar
how
hard
it
is
to
be
punished
for
a
crime
you
did
not
commit
you
have
not
told
me
anything
about
your
friends
i
knew
that
she
wanted
to
hear
from
harry
but
i
doubted
the
propriety
of
mentioning
his
name
because
i
did
not
know
what
he
intended
to
do
i
therefore
confined
my
remarks
to
doctor
and
dodson
and
rockland
and
his
wife
studiously
avoiding
harry
s
name
i
saw
that
she
was
disappointed
and
more
anxious
than
ever
to
hear
about
him
i
rose
to
depart
when
she
begged
me
to
stay
a
while
longer
you
have
not
told
me
about
all
of
your
friends
yet
she
said
as
she
blushed
and
looked
down
at
the
carpet
i
noticed
that
she
was
trembling
from
head
to
foot
and
her
bosom
rose
and
fell
rapidly
i
had
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
it
was
best
for
me
not
to
mention
harry
s
name
i
thought
that
the
best
plan
to
bring
about
a
reconciliation
would
be
to
say
nothing
on
the
subject
hoping
that
she
would
send
an
invitation
to
him
to
pay
her
a
visit
is
there
any
one
in
particular
whom
you
wish
to
inquire
about
miss
bramlett
yes
no
that
is
no
one
in
particular
but
i
was
thinking
that
lottie
would
be
so
happy
to
have
her
brother
with
and
as
she
said
this
the
crimson
tinge
on
her
cheeks
became
as
red
as
blood
could
make
it
yes
she
is
very
happy
now
since
her
brother
has
has
he
ah
never
mind
demar
i
will
not
detain
you
any
longer
give
my
love
to
lottie
and
bring
her
to
see
me
as
soon
as
she
is
able
to
i
took
her
extended
hand
and
felt
it
quiver
her
eyes
met
mine
for
a
second
and
there
was
a
meaning
look
in
them
which
i
understood
i
could
not
leave
her
thus
my
resolution
vanished
at
once
what
shall
i
tell
him
for
you
miss
bramlett
tell
whom
have
you
no
message
for
me
to
deliver
to
any
one
except
lottie
yes
no
i
i
i
passed
out
of
the
room
and
spoke
a
few
words
to
the
jailer
and
when
i
went
to
leave
i
glanced
a
look
into
viola
s
room
she
was
lying
on
the
bed
convulsed
with
grief
and
weeping
bitterly
i
sought
and
obtained
an
interview
with
rockland
in
order
to
have
a
consultation
about
miss
bramlett
s
case
the
iron
man
shook
his
head
ominously
when
i
asked
him
to
advise
me
what
i
should
do
about
the
case
the
supreme
court
will
reverse
it
said
he
beyond
question
but
that
will
do
no
good
it
will
only
serve
to
prolong
our
troubles
the
lower
court
committed
a
very
grave
error
in
allowing
the
jury
to
disperse
before
the
evidence
closed
hence
i
say
it
is
certain
that
a
new
trial
will
be
granted
but
again
i
ask
where
is
the
benefit
to
miss
bramlett
every
one
knows
she
is
guilty
the
proof
established
it
beyond
the
possibility
of
a
reasonable
doubt
poor
girl
i
pity
her
for
she
was
not
responsible
for
the
crime
she
was
crazy
beyond
question
when
she
committed
it
she
shall
not
be
punished
because
i
will
secure
executive
clemency
when
the
court
shall
have
finally
disposed
of
her
case
demar
i
have
just
been
informed
that
it
is
lottie
s
intention
to
return
to
the
jail
with
a
view
of
remaining
with
miss
bramlett
as
soon
as
she
is
able
to
yes
rockland
i
have
heard
lottie
say
that
such
was
her
this
must
be
prevented
by
all
means
and
no
one
can
do
it
but
you
i
shall
expect
you
to
exert
your
influence
in
that
direction
her
reputation
has
already
suffered
to
some
extent
by
her
conduct
and
it
must
be
prevented
in
do
you
know
rockland
that
lottie
affirms
that
she
knows
miss
bramlett
is
innocent
ah
demar
that
is
one
of
her
strange
infatuations
she
is
a
sensible
girl
in
whose
judgment
i
have
unbounded
confidence
but
her
friendship
for
miss
bramlett
has
caused
her
heart
to
get
the
upper
hand
of
her
brain
she
thinks
she
knows
that
her
friend
is
innocent
but
what
does
she
know
about
the
rules
of
evidence
she
thinks
everything
that
she
hears
can
be
offered
as
i
imagine
sir
that
you
will
find
lottie
better
posted
as
to
the
rules
of
evidence
than
you
think
she
has
been
reading
greenleaf
s
treatise
on
evidence
also
starkie
s
and
many
others
she
seems
to
comprehend
and
grasp
the
meaning
as
well
as
an
experienced
lawyer
would
she
says
she
will
furnish
evidence
to
clear
miss
bramlett
and
to
convict
the
real
ah
demar
that
is
the
strangest
mystery
that
has
ever
come
under
my
observation
if
she
knew
that
miss
bramlett
was
innocent
why
should
she
let
her
remain
in
jail
when
she
could
have
got
her
out
with
a
no
demar
if
you
build
your
hopes
on
that
foundation
you
will
meet
with
nothing
but
defeat
and
the
reasons
which
lottie
gives
for
withholding
the
proof
appear
to
me
to
be
good
she
says
that
she
is
waiting
to
collect
evidence
sufficient
to
convict
the
guilty
one
and
that
this
is
done
at
the
request
of
miss
very
well
demar
i
see
that
you
are
determined
to
pin
your
faith
to
lottie
s
skirts
the
truth
of
it
is
love
has
got
the
upper
hand
of
your
judgment
while
lottie
is
carried
away
by
her
affection
for
miss
bramlett
i
admire
those
who
stick
to
their
friends
but
we
ought
to
be
very
cautious
in
selecting
them
next
week
the
supreme
court
will
take
up
the
case
and
then
a
new
trial
will
be
granted
certain
and
you
and
lottie
shall
have
a
fair
chance
to
establish
the
defendant
s
innocence
if
you
when
i
left
the
iron
lawyer
i
was
chilled
to
the
very
marrow
of
my
bones
by
the
coldness
of
his
manner
about
eight
days
after
my
arrival
at
home
i
was
called
from
lottie
s
side
where
most
of
my
time
was
being
spent
to
assist
doctor
dodson
in
performing
a
difficult
surgical
operation
on
one
of
his
patients
in
fact
i
performed
the
operation
myself
under
doctor
dodson
s
advice
and
assistance
ah
ha
my
boy
said
the
old
doctor
when
the
delicate
job
was
finished
you
are
an
excellent
surgeon
so
you
are
i
am
proud
of
you
so
i
am
you
will
do
to
tie
to
ah
ha
that
you
will
lottie
need
not
be
afraid
to
hitch
on
to
you
my
boy
no
indeed
you
will
make
a
living
for
her
yes
yes
ah
ha
she
won
t
starve
by
marrying
you
you
must
remain
with
this
patient
day
and
night
until
all
danger
is
over
ah
ha
my
boy
stick
to
it
like
a
leech
i
ll
relieve
you
day
after
by
this
means
i
was
kept
away
from
lottie
two
days
and
nights
much
against
my
wish
but
i
stood
to
my
post
until
i
was
relieved
on
the
third
morning
by
doctor
dodson
i
hurried
to
rockland
s
residence
and
met
his
wife
at
the
door
how
is
lottie
i
hurriedly
inquired
as
i
entered
the
house
improving
rapidly
though
i
don
t
think
she
is
quite
as
prudent
as
she
ought
to
can
i
see
her
now
no
edward
she
is
asleep
i
believe
but
come
in
to
breakfast
and
then
you
can
see
i
obeyed
reluctantly
because
i
did
not
feel
like
eating
as
soon
as
breakfast
was
over
rockland
went
into
lottie
s
room
to
inform
her
that
i
was
waiting
to
see
her
she
will
receive
you
edward
said
the
kind
lady
as
she
came
into
the
parlor
where
i
was
waiting
she
bid
me
tell
you
to
come
the
door
of
lottie
s
room
was
half
open
when
i
entered
and
the
bed
where
i
expected
to
see
her
was
made
up
and
covered
with
a
counterpane
every
article
of
furniture
was
freshly
dusted
and
properly
arranged
two
large
vases
of
fresh
flowers
stood
on
the
mantel
and
the
room
contained
no
evidences
of
an
occupant
ah
she
has
moved
to
her
old
room
i
exclaimed
as
i
turned
to
go
out
when
i
felt
some
one
pluck
my
hair
behind
imagine
my
amazement
if
you
can
when
i
hurriedly
turned
round
and
saw
nothing
but
an
empty
room
where
i
had
expected
to
see
lottie
i
had
not
remained
there
however
but
a
second
or
two
when
i
heard
a
suppressed
laugh
and
looking
behind
the
door
i
discovered
my
darling
in
full
dress
beautiful
radiant
charming
and
lovely
with
a
mischievous
smile
playing
on
her
face
never
had
i
seen
her
looking
so
beautiful
before
the
color
of
the
rose
and
lily
were
mingled
on
her
fair
cheeks
while
evidences
of
restored
health
appeared
her
toilet
had
been
arranged
with
great
care
and
exquisite
taste
evidently
done
to
please
me
for
i
had
sent
word
that
i
was
coming
to
see
her
that
morning
she
wore
a
most
magnificent
brocade
silk
dress
with
full
train
the
body
and
skirts
were
covered
with
point
de
venice
lace
while
the
bodice
fitted
the
slender
waist
so
neatly
that
her
square
shoulders
and
tall
queenly
form
exhibited
their
beauty
to
great
advantage
my
picture
incased
in
a
heavy
gold
locket
was
suspended
by
a
costly
chain
around
her
neck
and
my
diamond
ring
sparkled
on
her
finger
the
great
rolls
of
pretty
golden
curls
had
been
half
confined
behind
her
head
with
a
blue
ribbon
while
a
fresh
white
rose
bordered
on
all
sides
with
pink
geraniums
adorned
her
throat
as
soon
as
my
eyes
encountered
the
lovely
creature
before
me
i
threw
up
my
bands
with
an
exclamation
of
surprise
when
i
left
her
two
days
previous
she
was
in
bed
where
i
had
expected
to
find
her
still
but
when
i
beheld
her
beautiful
form
standing
before
me
with
all
the
loveliness
and
beauty
of
an
angel
i
was
dazzled
and
overwhelmed
with
amazement
i
was
not
able
to
understand
how
such
a
speedy
recovery
had
been
effected
the
pretty
blue
eyes
had
regained
all
their
charming
brilliancy
and
the
stately
form
its
beauteous
symmetry
in
fact
my
darling
had
never
before
appeared
so
lovely
in
my
eyes
as
she
did
then
why
eddie
she
exclaimed
as
i
took
her
in
my
arms
where
have
you
been
hiding
all
this
time
i
declare
if

play
me

such
a
dodge

set
the
police
on

track

like
a
russian
she
dodged
under
my
arm
and
went
into
the
i
went
out
and
ordered
the
coachman
to
get
the
carriage
ready
then
came
back
to
the
parlor
and
waited
for
lottie

eddie
she
said
as
she
entered
the
parlor
and
took
a
seat
on
the
sofa
by
my
side
i
have
devoured
everything
on
the
table
and
like
oliver
twist
i
wanted
more
but
mother
closed
down
on
me
and
even
refused
to
let
me
eat
the
cold
scraps
that
were
left
in
the

imprudent
lottie
said
i
but
i
am
truly
glad
to
know
that
you
have
an
thank
you
eddie
but
now
i
must
ask
you
to
talk
business
with
me
a
while
we
must
lay
aside
all
selfish
thoughts
and
go
to
work
on
viola
s
case
you
must
not
talk
to
me
about
love
or
marriage
i
request
you
to
promise
me
here
and
now
that
you
will
devote
your
whole
attention
to
this
business
and
that
you
will
not
mention
love
to
me
until
viola
s
innocence
shall
be
established
will
you
or
will
you
not
do
it
i
promise
to
obey
you
in
all
things
under
all
circumstances
but
what
is
to
be
my
fate
if
we
fail
to
clear
viola
would
you
then
refuse
to
marry
me
yes
i
would
though
it
would
break
my
heart
to
do
it
but
i
love
you
too
well
to
make
you
the
husband
of
a
miserable
unhappy
woman
such
as
i
would
be
if
viola
is
not
cleared
but
i
tell
you
candidly
that
we
shall
all
be
happy
yet
if
you
will
trust
me
implicitly
i
must
have
your
entire
confidence
there
must
be
no
doubting
or
hesitating
in
this
business
again
i
ask
you
will
you
trust
me
in
all
things
connected
with
this
business
so
help
me
heaven
i
swear
i
will
enough
i
ask
no
more
read
that
letter
carefully
while
i
my
hair
and
then
i
will
tell
you
what
you
are
to
lottie
tell
me
where
you
got
this
ask
me
no
questions
but
trust
me
implicitly
i
will
not
submit
to
a
mind
very
good
issue
your
orders
and
i
will
obey
nothing
can
astonish
me
after
looking
at
this
that
is
a
mere
by
a
mountain
when
compared
with
other
things
that
i
lottie
this
letter
means
death
it
smells
of
blood
it
is
as
black
as
the
deepest
hell
hush
don
t
become
excited
coolness
and
courage
will
accomplish
more
than
anger
or
excitement
the
time
has
come
to
shake
up
the
dry
bones
in
the
valley
god
has
spared
me
in
order
to
make
me
his
instrument
in
saving
the
innocent
and
punishing
the
lottie
i
do
believe
you
are
aided
in
this
business
by
inspiration
directly
sent
to
you
from
perhaps
so
and
perhaps
not
but
viola
s
day
of
deliverance
is
near
at
hand
and
the
day
of
retribution
for
the
real
murderer
is
drawing
near
society
has
condemned
me
for
associating
with
viola
the
purest
best
most
patient
suffering
angel
that
ever
lived
i
will
make
society
blush
with
shame
for
its
cruelty
in
this
lottie
pardon
me
for
using
strong
language
but
i
think
the
circumstances
justify
it
therefore
i
say
that
the
writer
of
that
letter
ought
to
be
roasted
in
the
hottest
flames
of
stop
stop
don
t
use
such
language
as
that
it
does
no
good
we
must
move
cautiously
as
we
have
a
wily
foe
to
deal
with
we
must
have
a
witness
in
court
to
prove
that
handwriting
and
that
is
why
i
have
shown
you
that
letter
there
is
a
woman
in
this
city
by
whom
we
can
make
the
proof
provided
we
can
force
her
to
swear
the
truth
she
is
a
friend
to
the
writer
and
would
suffer
martyrdom
before
she
would
tell
anything
that
would
injure
him
if
she
knew
it
but
if
you
will
execute
a
little
plan
which
i
have
invented
i
will
answer
for
the
explain
the
plan
and
issue
orders
i
trust
you
now
with
more
faith
than
an
arab
would
the
author
of
the
koran
consider
me
a
machine
made
to
do
your
i
like
that
kind
of
talk
now
because
everything
depends
on
you
and
more
especially
on
you
lottie
you
are
the
pilot
and
i
am
only
the
we
will
not
dispute
about
that
but
you
must
have
an
interview
with
a
certain
woman
with
a
view
of
proving
the
handwriting
of
that
letter
you
are
acquainted
with
miss
clattermouth
i
believe
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
and
belief
i
should
say
i
was
but
i
would
not
like
to
confess
it
in
i
don
t
blame
you
for
that
because
there
is
not
much
honor
in
it
but
it
is
a
fortunate
thing
that
you
do
know
her
for
it
will
aid
you
in
this
business
i
want
you
to
go
and
see
her
take
this
letter
with
you
and
i
charge
you
under
no
circumstances
to
let
her
see
the
contents
but
you
will
manage
to
show
her
the
superscription
and
by
that
means
ascertain
whether
or
not
she
knows
who
wrote
it
remember
she
is
a
devoted
friend
of
the
writer
and
if
she
suspects
your
object
your
labor
is
lost
you
must
invent
some
plan
to
direct
her
attention
to
the
letter
and
she
will
probably
ask
you
where
you
got
it
then
you
can
ask
her
if
she
knows
the
handwriting
do
you
think
you
can
manage
the
business
so
as
to
accomplish
the
purpose
without
rousing
her
suspicions
lottie
you
have
asked
me
to
trust
you
and
i
am
going
to
do
it
now
i
ask
you
to
trust
me
will
you
do
it
that
i
will
with
all
the
faith
that
is
in
me
and
without
intending
to
flatter
you
i
would
risk
my
soul
s
future
happiness
on
your
judgment
and
thank
you
thank
you
darling
enough
on
that
branch
of
the
subject
let
us
now
discuss
another
shall
we
let
harry
into
our
secrets
and
ask
his
assistance
no
indeed
we
must
not
because
his
love
for
viola
would
cause
his
heart
to
control
his
brain
and
endanger
our
plans
he
has
quieted
down
since
his
late
troubles
and
it
is
better
to
let
him
alone
the
breach
between
him
and
viola
will
heal
itself
when
she
is
be
it
so
then
you
are
the
you
must
not
lose
sight
of
our
vicksburg
witness
it
would
be
advisable
to
write
to
him
immediately
that
evidence
i
consider
the
most
important
of
i
must
confess
i
can
not
see
its
application
to
viola
s
case
but
you
may
depend
on
me
for
having
the
witness
here
when
the
trial
comes
you
shall
be
posted
as
to
its
application
in
due
time
there
are
two
individuals
in
this
city
who
are
mounted
on
very
high
horses
riding
to
their
fate
they
are
enjoying
the
ride
just
now
unconscious
of
the
precipice
toward
which
they
are
hastening
they
are
reveling
in
their
fancied
security
little
dreaming
of
the
mine
soon
to
be
sprung
under
their
one
of
them
is
the
writer
of
this
letter
the
other
the
one
to
whom
it
was
directed
am
i
not
correct
in
that
guess
lottie
you
are
well
if
anybody
but
my
darling
had
told
me
this
i
would
not
have
believed
a
word
of
it
this
business
is
going
to
cause
some
people
s
fine
castles
to
come
toppling
down
and
great
will
be
the
fall
it
won
t
be
the
first
instance
where
a
man
was
hung
on
the
gallows
he
had
built
for
another
you
may
have
heard
of
a
man
who
erected
a
gallows
fifty
cubits
high
on
which
he
intended
to
hang
his
neighbor
but
the
spectators
were
no
doubt
surprised
one
morning
when
they
saw
the
body
of
the
builder
dangling
from
his
own
yes
that
was
a
case
in
which
god
seems
to
have
directly
just
so
and
he
has
directly
interfered
in
viola
s
case
lottie
i
am
dying
with
curiosity
to
know
how
you
got
possession
of
that
you
shall
know
everything
that
i
know
but
not
at
present
i
have
a
reason
for
withholding
the
information
just
now
which
i
can
not
explain
remember
you
have
promised
to
trust
me
fully
in
this
yes
and
i
mean
to
do
it
but
the
very
sight
of
this
letter
freezes
the
warm
blood
in
my
veins
i
feel
cold
rigors
stealing
over
me
now
it
is
horrible
to
contemplate
it
surpasses
my
comprehension
it
would
make
satan
blush
to
read
this
most
diabolical
composition
he
would
be
inclined
to
abdicate
in
favor
of
the
author
of
that
letter
as
the
one
best
qualified
to
run
the
infernal
hush
that
is
wicked
language
go
see
if
the
carriage
is
ready
while
i
get
my
hat
and
cloak

will
first
go
with
me
to
the
jail

me
with
viola

and
see
miss
clattermouth
about
the
proof
as
to
the
handwriting
then
return
to
the
jail

with
us
to
dinner
and
bring
me
home
at
night
there
now
you
have
the
programme
for
the
day

you
must
sharpen
your
wits
before
you
tackle
miss
clattermouth
she
is
a
clever
little
detective
herself
and
will
get
the
best
of
you
if
you
don
t
be
if

the
upper
hand
of
me

this
business

of
my
come

t
take
my
arm

chapter
xxxi
i
escorted
lottie
to
the
jail
and
when
she
and
miss
bramlett
rushed
into
each
other
s
arms
i
was
so
deeply
moved
by
the
affectionate
meeting
of
those
two
devoted
friends
that
i
felt
the
tears
begin
to
trickle
down
my
cheeks
for
full
five
minutes
they
remained
silently
clasped
in
each
other
s
strong
embrace
heaven
bless
you
my
precious
true
unselfish
friend
exclaimed
miss
bramlett
still
holding
lottie
to
her
heart

answered
my
prayers
for

my
knees
i
have
spent
four
hours
every
day
in
sending
up
my
supplications
in
behalf
of
my
darling
lottie
i
am
one
of
those
who
have
unlimited
confidence
in
the
goodness
and
mercy
of
god
and
believe
he
answers
the
prayers
of
those
who
ask
in
the
spirit
of
true
faith
every
time
i
knelt
down
to
pray
for
the
recovery
of
my
darling
friend
i
thought
of
that
precious
promise
which
our
dear
saviour
made
with
his
own
lips
when
he
said
ask
and
it
shall
be
given
you
seek
and
ye
shall
find
knock
and
it
shall
be
opened
unto
you
for
every
one
that
asketh
receiveth
and
he
that
seeketh
findeth
and
to
him
that
knocketh
it
shall
be
now
lottie
when
i
prayed
i
did
honestly
believe
that
our
dear
jesus
would
remember
his
precious
promise
and
sure
enough
he
has
oh
dear
god
receive
my
humble
but
sincere
thanks
for
this
great
blessing
lottie
then
came
to
me
smiling
through
her
tears
and
looking
supremely
happy
you
may
go
to
see
miss
clattermouth
now
edward
and
you
must
not
fail
to
return
here
punctually
at
four
o
clock
for
i
am
going
to
order
another
one
of
those
cozy
dinners
to
be
served
in
viola
s
room
therefore
you
must
not
keep
us
waiting
remember
the
instructions
and
let
no
consideration
or
circumstance
prevent
the
success
of
our
enterprise
which
you
know
to
be
of
such
great
pressing
her
hand
to
my
lips
and
promising
to
put
in
my
appearance
punctually
at
four
o
clock
i
jumped
into
the
carriage
and
ordered
the
coachman
to
drive
to
the
residence
of
miss
clattermouth
as
the
vehicle
went
rumbling
over
the
rough
road
i
began
to
reflect
on
the
business
before
me
with
a
view
of
arranging
my
plans
so
as
to
be
ready
to
act
promptly
at
the
proper
time
the
carriage
halted
in
front
of
the
house
before
any
definite
scheme
was
arranged
in
my
mind
walking
up
to
the
door
i
gave
the
bell
a
vigorous
pull
and
a
moment
after
i
heard
the
slamming
of
innumerable
doors
and
then
the
front
one
flew
open
and
there
appeared
a
living
creature
it
would
be
a
misnomer
to
say
it
was
a
woman
yet
it
was
not
a
man
or
monkey
and
not
being
a
believer
in
witches
i
am
at
a
loss
to
describe
the
horrible
looking
object
that
stood
with
glaring
eyes
riveted
on
me
miss
cushman
s
representation
of
the
gypsy
in
guy
mannering
would
be
a
fairy
when
compared
with
the
hideous
object
who
darkened
that
door
i
ran
back
eight
or
ten
paces
while
an
involuntary
shudder
darted
through
my
body
i
did
not
smell
brimstone
see
fire
or
hear
thunder
but
the
same
feelings
of
horror
seized
upon
me
that
i
had
experienced
once
upon
a
time
when
i
went
to
see
the
infernal
regions
in
a
museum
this
a
name
i
think
most
proper
to
give
her
held
out
her
long
bony
arm
toward
me
and
began
to
work
her
fingers
as
if
she
wanted
to
grab
me
what
do
ye
stand
there
for
staring
at
a
body
like
an
idiot
she
growled
are
ye
dumb
can
t
ye
tell
what
ye
want
i
wish
to
see
miss
clattermouth
i
stammered
with
no
little
difficulty
get
along
with
ye
to
tadpoddle
s
then
and
the
door
was
closed
with
a
slam
and
i
felt
very
much
relieved
i
was
pleased
to
learn
that
i
should
find
miss
clattermouth
and
miss
tadpoddle
together
as
i
imagined
that
this
circumstance
would
facilitate
the
important
business
which
i
was
so
anxious
to
transact
i
lost
no
time
you
may
be
sure
in
leaping
into
the
carriage
and
as
i
did
so
i
gave
the
coachman
instructions
to
hasten
to
the
tadpoddle
mansion
i
found
the
front
hall
door
open
when
i
arrived
and
being
well
acquainted
with
the
premises
i
immediately
and
without
ceremony
passed
through
the
hall
and
made
my
appearance
at
the
door
of
miss
tadpoddle
s
boudoir
which
i
also
found
standing
wide
open
as
i
entered
the
house
my
ears
were
pierced
with
a
succession
of
the
most
doleful
and
cries
that
i
had
ever
heard
miss
tadpoddle
was
lying
on
the
sofa
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
her
mother
was
bathing
her
temples
with
some
sort
of
liquid
while
miss
clattermouth
was
holding
a
smelling
bottle
to
her
nose
oh
mother
how
can
i
live
when
my
sweet
precious
little
darling
is
dead
oh
ho
ho
ho
it
will
kill
me
i
know
it
will
every
time
i
shut
my
eyes
i
can
see
the
pretty
little
darling
in
his
tiny
coffin
wrapped
in
his
little
ruffled
shroud
with
his
sweet
little
eyes
closed
just
as
if
he
was
asleep
oh
ho
ho
ho
shall
i
never
see
him
again
in
this
world
oh
mother
let
me
die
i
do
not
want
to
live
now
since
my
little
angel
is
gone
from
me
forever
he
loved
me
so
much
and
was
such
a
comfort
to
me
he
was
always
crying
after
me
when
i
was
away
from
my
heart
was
deeply
moved
to
hear
the
poor
lady
s
sorrowful
lamentations
and
it
was
with
some
difficulty
that
i
restrained
my
tears
i
began
to
look
round
for
a
little
coffin
but
it
was
not
there
i
then
cast
a
glance
up
and
down
the
hall
expecting
to
see
an
empty
baby
carriage
or
tenantless
crib
but
i
saw
them
not
no
little
baby
shoes
or
baby
frocks
were
in
sight
no
baby
hats
no
broken
toys
or
any
article
such
as
pleases
little
boys
were
to
be
seen
that
a
boy
baby
was
dead
i
concluded
was
certain
for
i
heard
her
speak
of
his
little
coffin
and
his
little
shroud
now
what
does
it
all
mean
was
a
question
which
naturally
presented
itself
to
my
mind
who
is
the
little
angel
that
has
been
taken
back
to
heaven
ah
i
have
it
now
she
has
adopted
some
sweet
little
orphan
child
and
just
as
she
began
to
love
it
dearly
the
little
darling
has
laid
down
and
died
i
beg
pardon
ladies
said
i
as
i
bowed
to
miss
clattermouth
i
did
not
know
that
death
had
entered
this
house
else
i
should
not
have
oh
doctor
exclaimed
miss
tadpoddle
wringing
her
hands
and
tossing
her
head
from
side
to
side
as
if
suffering
untold
anguish
i
am
so
glad
you
have
come
do
pray
put
me
to
sleep
as
soon
as
you
can
for
my
poor
heart
is
forever
crushed
i
never
shall
survive
this
awful
calamity
ah
doctor
my
poor
little
darling
is
taken
from
me
and
no
one
will
ever
love
me
as
he
did
he
was
always
crying
to
get
in
my
lap
for
heaven
s
sake
give
me
a
sleeping
drug
i
don
t
care
what
it
is
anything
to
make
me
forget
this
melancholy
dispensation
of
providence
oh
me
it
is
more
than
i
can
bear
to
think
that
i
never
shall
see
poor
little
tottie
any
more
it
will
be
the
death
of
me
i
know
it
will
now
i
was
perfectly
amazed
when
i
heard
tottie
s
name
mentioned
for
the
whole
mystery
was
then
cleared
up
all
this
nonsense
was
produced
by
the
death
of
an
poodle
dog
and
i
hastened
to
a
pitcher
of
water
poured
out
a
glass
and
pretended
to
get
strangled
so
i
might
have
a
chance
to
conceal
the
mirth
that
was
about
to
precipitate
me
into
a
fit
of
laughter
i
was
compelled
to
walk
out
into
the
hall
in
order
to
gain
time
to
get
control
of
myself
as
i
did
not
wish
to
appear
rude
miss
tadpoddle
seemed
to
be
growing
worse
all
the
time
and
continued
to
implore
me
for
a
sleeping
drug
and
i
concluded
that
it
was
best
to
make
a
show
of
compassion
which
i
did
but
not
without
a
considerable
effort
i
requested
miss
clattermouth
to
procure
me
a
spoonful
of
flour
and
while
she
went
after
it
i
took
out
my
medicines
and
scattered
them
about
on
the
top
of
a
bureau
that
stood
in
one
corner
of
the
room
and
as
i
was
thinking
more
about
the
proof
which
i
wanted
to
make
by
miss
clattermouth
than
anything
else
i
took
out
the
letter
and
laid
it
down
among
the
medicines
where
i
knew
she
could
see
it
when
she
brought
the
flour
my
mind
was
wrought
up
to
a
high
pitch
of
anxiety
because
i
had
been
led
by
lottie
to
believe
that
the
fate
of
miss
bramlett
depended
entirely
on
the
success
or
failure
of
my
enterprise
consequently
an
unusual
degree
of
excitement
seized
upon
me
when
i
saw
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
letter
as
she
handed
me
the
flour
i
felt
my
heart
thumping
violently
in
my
breast
while
i
held
my
breath
and
tried
to
assume
a
careless
air
as
i
began
to
finger
my
drugs
there
was
a
large
mirror
swinging
on
the
top
of
the
bureau
which
enabled
me
to
watch
miss
clattermouth
without
letting
her
know
what
i
was
up
to
and
i
could
see
that
her
little
round
eyes
were
intently
fixed
on
the
letter
while
an
expression
of
curiosity
mantled
her
face
i
felt
my
knees
knocking
against
each
other
and
my
whole
frame
began
to
shake
from
the
intense
anxiety
that
possessed
me
when
banquo
s
ghost
shook
its
gory
locks
at
macbeth
at
the
banquet
he
did
not
tremble
more
than
i
did
on
that
important
occasion
oh
doctor
exclaimed
miss
tadpoddle
are
you
going
to
let
me
die
why
don
t
you
put
me
to
sleep
are
you
going
to
save
my
life
or
not
my
dear
madame
i
beg
you
to
command
a
little
patience
you
shall
soon
be
relieved
it
is
our
duty
to
submit
humbly
to
the
decrees
of
yes
yes
i
know
it
is
doctor
but
those
who
never
felt
the
heavy
hand
of
affliction
laid
upon
them
as
it
is
now
laid
on
poor
me
can
not
understand
or
appreciate
the
awful
i
hastily
prepared
three
wheat
dough
pills
and
persuaded
her
to
swallow
them
assuring
her
that
they
would
put
her
to
sleep
in
a
very
short
while
and
in
less
than
five
minutes
she
declared
that
she
felt
a
great
deal
better
ah
doctor
you
are
such
a
good
physician
you
seem
to
comprehend
the
nature
of
one
s
complaint
at
a
glance
now
you
know
i
never
exaggerate
there
is
nothing
i
despise
more
than
i
do
exaggeration
still
i
do
believe
my
nervous
system
is
completely
destroyed
but
if
anybody
can
restore
my
shattered
system
you
are
the
man
to
do
it
i
declare
i
begin
to
feel
drowsy
now
oh
what
a
relief
just
run
your
hand
through
my
hair
and
over
my
throbbing
temples
oh
that
is
delicious
indeed
it
is
you
do
not
know
how
much
good
it
is
doing
me
at
the
end
of
twenty
minutes
from
the
time
i
administered
my
pills
miss
tadpoddle
was
happy
in
the
arms
of
morpheus
probably
dreaming
sweetly
about
poodle
dogs
now
my
friends
i
wish
to
say
that
as
a
practicing
physician
i
am
able
to
recommend
wheat
dough
pills
as
an
infallible
remedy
for
hysterics
especially
when
that
dangerous
disease
is
caused
by
the
death
of
poodle
dogs
as
soon
as
i
had
succeeded
in
silencing
miss
tadpoddle
i
turned
my
attention
to
miss
clattermouth
and
the
important
letter
on
which
i
noticed
she
every
now
and
then
cast
an
inquiring
look
i
was
waiting
for
her
to
propound
the
question
which
i
inferred
from
her
restlessness
she
was
on
the
eve
of
doing
after
eying
the
letter
for
some
time
she
picked
it
up
and
after
scrutinizing
it
carefully
when
she
imagined
i
was
not
observing
her
movements
for
i
was
watching
her
through
the
mirror
by
a
side
glance
she
turned
her
back
toward
me
and
began
to
slip
the
letter
out
of
the
envelope
i
knew
that
it
would
not
do
to
allow
her
to
see
the
contents
of
the
letter
therefore
as
soon
as
i
divined
her
object
i
went
to
the
bureau
pretending
to
be
collecting
my
scattered
medicines
where
she
could
see
that
i
was
in
a
position
to
observe
her
actions
did
you
drop
this
letter
here
doctor
she
carelessly
observed
as
i
came
round
so
as
to
confront
her
yes
i
believe
i
did
i
must
have
dropped
it
when
i
took
out
my
pocket
case
a
while
i
should
like
to
know
what
you
are
doing
with
that
letter
doctor
demar
i
see
that
it
was
not
addressed
to
i
was
considerably
puzzled
by
this
question
because
i
did
not
know
what
sort
of
an
answer
i
ought
to
make
but
it
occurred
to
my
mind
that
it
would
be
advisable
to
rouse
her
curiosity
still
higher
if
i
could
having
made
up
my
mind
to
act
on
that
idea
i
carelessly
observed
that
there
was
a
great
secret
connected
with
that
letter
which
i
did
not
consider
myself
at
liberty
to
reveal
now
i
should
like
very
much
to
know
what
great
secret
ben
bowles
could
have
to
communicate
to
that
woman
why
do
you
mention
bowles
name
in
connection
with
that
letter
miss
clattermouth
oh
that
is
a
great
secret
which
i
do
not
consider
myself
at
liberty
to
reveal
she
said
in
a
tantalizing
tone
which
convinced
me
that
she
was
piqued
because
i
had
mentioned
a
secret
it
is
a
mystery
to
me
she
continued
why
bowles
should
constitute
you
as
his
messenger
to
carry
his
letters
to
that
woman
what
has
ben
bowles
got
to
do
with
it
i
hope
doctor
demar
that
you
do
not
consider
me
an
idiot
indeed
madame
i
do
not
but
on
the
contrary
i
have
set
you
down
in
my
mind
as
one
of
the
cleverest
ladies
in
memphis
but
what
has
that
to
do
with
the
question
i
propounded
to
you
do
you
imagine
that
i
do
not
know
who
wrote
that
letter
why
should
i
take
the
trouble
to
imagine
anything
about
it
you
are
a
real
yankee
you
answer
my
questions
by
propounding
others
we
will
let
the
subject
drop
unless
you
can
make
a
candid
answer
to
a
simple
i
crave
your
pardon
madame
and
promise
to
furnish
a
direct
answer
to
all
your
questions
provided
you
will
agree
to
do
the
same
with
my
very
good
i
consent
to
the
agreement
where
did
you
get
that
letter
now
i
was
completely
nonplussed
by
that
question
and
entirely
thrown
off
my
guard
and
did
not
know
what
answer
to
make
i
began
to
stammer
and
halt
and
despite
all
my
efforts
to
invent
a
suitable
answer
i
made
an
absolute
failure
my
confusion
proved
to
be
the
very
lever
that
enabled
me
to
pry
the
secret
out
of
its
when
miss
clattermouth
saw
my
great
confusion
her
curiosity
went
up
to
the
highest
pitch
and
she
exclaimed
ah
ha
doctor
demar
you
are
caught
in
your
own
trap
you
have
been
a
carrier
of
a
clandestine
correspondence
between
ben
bowles
and
his
dulcinia
del
toboso
and
i
must
say
that
i
am
surprised
and
mortified
to
make
the
startling
you
may
imagine
that
you
know
that
handwriting
miss
clattermouth
but
i
beg
permission
to
inform
you
that
you
are
very
much
i
say
mistaken
indeed
i
know
that
handwriting
as
well
as
i
do
my
own
and
if
i
were
to
find
a
line
of
ben
bowles
writing
in
the
great
sahara
desert
i
would
know
it
yes
i
would
swear
on
a
stack
of
bibles
as
high
as
this
house
that
that
was
written
by
ben
thanks
be
to
heaven
i
mentally
exclaimed
and
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
keep
from
shouting
with
joy
i
seized
the
letter
and
pretended
that
i
had
suddenly
thought
of
an
appointment
down
town
looking
at
my
watch
i
hurried
from
the
house
leaving
miss
clattermouth
angry
and
astonished
at
my
conduct
miss
tadpoddle
recovered
thanks
to
my
dough
pills
and
a
vigorous
constitution
but
she
became
misanthropic
and
sullen
resigning
her
office
as
of
the
tramp
reform
association
which
left
that
noble
institution
without
her
patronage
causing
it
to
go
into
bankruptcy
the
untimely
death
of
an
poodle
dog
caused
many
a
forlorn
tramp
to
seek
a
night
s
lodging
in
the
who
but
for
the
sad
event
would
have
found
comfortable
entertainment
at
the
headquarters
of
the
tramp
reform
association
as
soon
as
i
left
miss
clattermouth
i
hastened
to
the
jail
being
anxious
to
acquaint
lottie
with
the
success
that
had
crowned
my
efforts
as
to
the
proof
desired
eureka
eureka
i
exclaimed
as
i
went
hurriedly
into
the
room
where
lottie
and
viola
were
our
luck
has
changed
at
last
miss
clattermouth
says
she
will
swear
it
is
bowles
handwriting
and
she
will
kiss
a
stack
of
bibles
on
it
as
high
as
tadpoddle
s
house
which
you
know
is
three
stories
high
not
counting
the
cellar
she
says
she
would
recognize
the
writing
if
she
were
to
find
it
in
a
desert
the
name
of
which
i
do
not
just
now
remember
though
it
is
situated
somewhere
on
the
other
side
of
the
sit
down
edward
and
give
me
the
letter
i
declare
you
are
indeed
i
am
excited
have
i
not
good
cause
to
be
did
you
not
tell
me
that
miss
bramlett
s
fate
depended
on
the
proof
that
i
have
procured
yes
but
sit
down
and
tell
us
how
you
managed
to
succeed
so
i
then
gave
a
graphic
description
of
all
that
had
occurred
dwelling
eloquently
on
my
splendid
maneuvering
and
the
sweet
smiles
that
were
showered
on
me
and
the
numerous
thanks
tendered
by
those
grateful
girls
amply
compensated
me
for
all
my
trouble
the
steward
had
an
excellent
dinner
prepared
which
was
served
in
miss
bramlett
s
room
at
four
o
clock
it
was
very
late
in
the
evening
when
lottie
and
i
took
our
departure
from
the
jail
about
a
week
after
those
events
occurred
i
received
a
note
from
rockland
requesting
an
interview
with
me
at
his
office
when
i
read
the
note
it
caused
a
pang
of
uneasiness
to
dart
through
my
breast
because
i
always
expected
bad
news
when
the
iron
lawyer
had
anything
to
communicate
i
found
the
iron
lawyer
as
usual
busily
at
work
with
innumerable
old
papers
piled
high
before
him
take
a
seat
demar
he
said
without
looking
at
me
i
will
be
at
leisure
in
a
he
then
began
to
dash
the
papers
about
as
if
he
were
angry
with
the
inoffensive
documents
while
my
mind
was
ill
at
ease
and
full
of
curiosity
after
the
lapse
of
five
minutes
he
wheeled
his
chair
around
so
as
to
confront
me
demar
i
have
just
received
a
telegram
informing
me
that
miss
bramlett
s
case
has
been
reversed
and
another
trial
granted
this
is
no
news
to
me
for
you
remember
i
told
you
that
the
supreme
court
was
bound
to
reverse
the
case
i
must
confess
however
that
i
can
not
see
wherein
this
is
going
to
benefit
that
unfortunate
girl
because
as
you
have
often
heard
me
say
there
is
no
possible
chance
to
secure
an
acquittal
under
the
mountain
of
testimony
that
will
be
adduced
against
her
i
want
you
to
understand
however
demar
that
i
mean
to
do
all
i
can
for
miss
bramlett
but
i
do
not
hesitate
to
say
that
during
thirty
years
practice
at
the
bar
i
have
never
seen
such
a
complete
unbroken
chain
of
circumstantial
evidence
arrayed
against
a
prisoner
as
was
mustered
on
the
trial
against
miss
bramlett
if
you
will
meet
me
at
the
criminal
in
the
morning
at
ten
o
clock
we
will
arrange
with
quillet
to
have
a
day
set
for
the
trial
demar
you
must
watch
lottie
and
not
let
her
become
entangled
in
this
unfortunate
affair
she
may
listen
to
you
but
she
outtalks
me
the
fact
of
the
business
is
i
can
not
have
the
heart
to
scold
that
dear
girl
but
she
must
be
separated
from
miss
bramlett
and
i
depend
on
you
to
do
mr
rockland
i
think
we
had
better
let
lottie
have
her
own
way
in
this
affair
for
if
i
am
not
very
sadly
mistaken
she
will
snap
the
strong
chain
of
circumstantial
evidence
into
a
thousand
pieces
you
have
always
told
me
that
you
thought
she
possessed
a
high
order
of
intellect
but
sir
when
this
case
is
tried
you
will
have
good
cause
to
think
she
has
a
mind
of
a
most
extraordinary
demar
i
think
you
and
lottie
both
are
on
the
direct
road
to
the
lunatic
asylum
and
i
hope
you
will
take
miss
bramlett
with
you
and
not
leave
her
here
on
my
hands
it
is
the
height
of
folly
to
say
miss
bramlett
did
not
murder
her
little
brother
besides
this
she
has
been
guilty
of
other
crimes
so
black
that
all
the
water
in
the
atlantic
ocean
could
not
wash
the
stain
from
her
character
though
i
believe
she
is
insane
and
intend
to
convince
the
governor
of
it
and
he
will
grant
a
pardon
beyond
i
felt
a
sensation
of
relief
as
soon
as
i
stepped
out
of
rockland
s
office
i
hastened
to
convey
the
good
news
of
a
new
trial
to
lottie
and
the
first
thing
she
did
was
to
offer
up
thanks
to
providence
for
this
evidence
of
his
favors
have
you
heard
from
our
vicksburg
witness
lately
edward
yes
i
replied
and
he
will
come
at
any
time
when
he
is
notified
that
we
want
very
good
then
as
soon
as
you
ascertain
the
day
the
trial
is
to
come
off
you
must
send
him
a
telegram
immediately
we
are
ready
for
the
grand
battle
and
victory
will
be
ours
lottie
don
t
be
too
sanguine
of
success
a
good
general
always
prepares
for
a
retreat
before
he
engages
in
battle
so
that
when
the
battle
is
lost
he
can
save
his
edward
you
must
not
talk
of
defeat
in
connection
with
this
case
i
have
a
magic
wand
with
which
i
can
perform
more
wonders
than
could
aladdin
with
his
magic
lamp
there
is
a
good
genius
serving
me
in
this
business
whose
powers
will
surprise
and
startle
lottie
i
do
not
think
you
are
justifiable
in
keeping
secrets
from
me
in
connection
with
this
i
want
to
test
your
faith
in
me
to
see
whether
you
can
trust
me
as
i
have
trusted
you
my
brother
told
me
you
were
untrue
to
me
and
had
eloped
with
another
woman
i
had
faith
in
you
and
refused
to
believe
his
enough
keep
your
own
secrets
i
will
serve
you
and
believe
in
you
as
faithfully
as
orlando
believed
in
his
thank
you
edward
and
i
promise
you
i
will
perform
more
wonders
for
you
than
rosalind
did
for
her
orlando
she
changed
a
shepherd
boy
to
a
beautiful
maiden
but
i
will
show
an
angel
of
purity
where
everybody
sees
a
mr
rockland
and
i
met
quillet
promptly
at
ten
o
clock
next
morning
at
the
and
the
kindly
consented
that
rockland
should
fix
any
day
for
the
trial
that
he
chose
consequently
it
was
set
for
thursday
that
being
tuesday
i
repaired
immediately
to
the
telegraph
office
and
sent
a
dispatch
to
the
vicksburg
witness
requesting
his
attendance
and
asking
him
to
answer
whether
he
could
come
or
not
the
reply
came
he
promised
to
come
without
fail
now
said
lottie
when
i
showed
her
the
telegram
i
have
ordered
the
carriage
and
want
you
to
escort
me
to
the
do
not
look
at
me
as
if
you
were
angry
i
must
go
to
the
lottie
you
know
i
could
not
be
angry
with
you
but
will
you
be
so
good
as
to
inform
me
why
you
wish
to
go
to
the
to
be
stared
at
by
a
motley
crowd
of
very
rough
people
i
certainly
have
no
wish
to
conceal
my
motive
from
you
in
the
first
place
i
am
going
to
examine
all
the
papers
connected
with
viola
s
case
especially
the
evidence
that
was
given
in
on
the
first
i
can
get
those
papers
and
bring
them
to
you
and
you
can
have
ample
time
to
examine
of
course
you
could
do
that
but
i
have
another
reason
for
wishing
to
visit
the
i
want
you
to
introduce
me
to
the
judge
and
all
the
lawyers
i
want
to
catch
a
few
ideas
in
regard
to
the
manner
of
proceeding
in
court
so
that
when
viola
is
put
on
trial
i
will
not
be
very
much
embarrassed
i
shall
ask
the
judge
to
let
me
some
of
the
state
s
witnesses
and
you
know
i
ought
to
see
how
it
is
done
and
that
is
exactly
what
i
am
going
to
find
out
you
are
going
to
leap
into
the
contest
as
an
attorney
and
plead
your
client
s
case
no
i
am
not
going
to
make
any
leap
at
all
but
i
have
a
trap
set
to
catch
certain
birds
and
i
am
going
to
arrange
the
bait
myself
and
at
the
proper
time
i
shall
spring
the
trigger
and
pen
the
game
it
is
my
intention
to
spend
the
remainder
of
this
day
in
the
in
fact
i
think
i
shall
make
that
place
my
headquarters
until
the
trial
is
do
you
think
you
can
stand
the
jokes
and
jeers
and
vulgar
gaze
of
such
a
crowd
as
you
must
necessarily
meet
in
a
criminal
i
can
bear
anything
endure
anything
submit
to
anything
in
order
to
save
my
dear
unfortunate
friend
lottie
i
do
not
believe
this
world
ever
contained
another
such
a
noble
girl
as
you
so
unselfish
so
thoughtful
of
others
so
generous
and
sympathetic
edward
reserve
your
compliments
until
viola
is
clear
and
then
you
may
pile
the
flattery
on
as
much
as
you
i
suppose
you
will
make
an
eloquent
speech
to
the
jury
in
defense
of
your
client
i
can
in
my
imagination
hear
the
sweet
words
echoing
through
the
halls
of
cease
your
levity
if
you
please
the
occasion
demands
seriousness
you
know
very
well
i
do
not
intend
to
make
a
speech
but
i
am
in
real
downright
earnest
when
i
say
that
i
am
going
to
ask
the
judge
to
allow
me
to
some
of
the
witnesses
you
see
i
have
been
studying
a
great
many
commentaries
on
criminal
evidence
and
have
learned
that
when
a
witness
swears
falsely
to
one
material
point
he
is
not
to
be
believed
in
anything
else
now
i
am
going
to
propound
certain
questions
to
some
of
the
witnesses
and
if
they
swear
what
they
did
on
the
former
trial
why
then
they
will
be
in
my
lottie
don
t
you
think
it
advisable
to
acquaint
rockland
with
all
the
new
facts
in
your
possession
so
he
could
be
prepared
to
handle
them
when
the
trial
comes
off
no
i
do
not
and
besides
this
i
can
not
reveal
to
any
one
the
secrets
confided
to
me
by
another
without
her
ah
it
is
a
her
then
who
works
the
wires
behind
the
curtains
there
are
no
wires
to
work
nor
any
curtains
to
work
behind
but
enough
of
this
come
we
will
now
go
to
the
as
i
entered
the
with
lottie
leaning
on
my
arm
the
eyes
of
the
lawyers
and
spectators
were
at
once
fixed
on
her
with
a
curious
gaze
as
she
moved
across
the
room
like
an
empress
and
advancing
to
the
clerk
s
desk
asked
for
the
papers
in
the
bramlett
case
the
little
clerk
whose
nose
was
very
large
stood
with
his
mouth
wide
open
his
pen
in
his
hand
gazing
at
the
angelic
beauty
before
him
as
much
astonished
as
if
a
ghost
had
suddenly
risen
out
of
the
ground
lottie
again
called
for
the
papers
when
the
little
clerk
began
to
stammer
you
had
better
that
is
we
could
not
i
must
ask
you
to
see
quillet
madame
it
is
against
the
rules
to
let
papers
go
out
of
the
office
except
to
the
i
do
not
wish
to
take
the
papers
out
of
the
office
sir
replied
lottie
modestly
as
she
smiled
sweetly
i
can
examine
them
the
little
clerk
was
very
much
embarrassed
but
refused
to
let
her
have
the
papers
until
he
was
ordered
to
do
so
by
quillet
lottie
took
the
great
bundle
of
documents
and
scattering
them
about
on
the
table
seated
herself
and
began
to
read
them
while
the
judge
and
quillet
eyed
her
closely
a
group
of
lawyers
assembled
inside
of
the
bar
and
began
to
whisper
to
each
other
occasionally
pointing
at
lottie
who
was
too
deeply
engaged
with
the
papers
to
notice
them
she
is
the
most
beautiful
woman
i
ever
saw
i
heard
quillet
whisper
to
a
lawyer
who
sat
near
him
who
is
she
inquired
the
man
to
whom
quillet
had
addressed
the
remark
miss
charlotte
wallingford
i
believe
an
adopted
daughter
of
well
quillet
i
indorse
your
judgment
i
don
t
think
i
ever
saw
such
a
perfect
model
of
beauty
before
what
is
she
up
to
there
she
seems
to
work
as
if
she
meant
she
is
examining
the
evidence
in
the
bramlett
case
she
is
a
stanch
friend
to
the
defendant
you
were
not
here
when
the
case
was
tried
i
believe
well
it
is
an
interesting
case
full
of
strange
romantic
mystery
it
is
to
be
tried
again
next
thursday
so
you
will
hear
the
quillet
if
i
could
marry
such
a
woman
as
that
i
think
i
should
be
willing
to
surrender
my
bachelor
freedom
and
put
my
neck
under
old
hymen
s
yes
no
doubt
of
it
and
i
dare
say
i
could
find
a
brigade
of
men
in
this
city
who
would
do
likewise
but
you
need
not
lay
siege
to
that
castle
that
article
is
already
how
is
that
she
is
going
to
marry
that
tall
awkward
booby
yonder
leaning
against
that
column
the
one
with
the
long
shaggy
well
well
there
is
no
accounting
for
a
woman
s
taste
it
is
surpassingly
strange
that
so
glorious
a
beauty
should
take
a
fancy
to
such
a
bulk
of
humanity
as
that
hush
hush
he
is
listening
to
then
they
continued
the
conversation
in
lower
tones
so
i
could
not
hear
any
more
the
court
took
a
thirty
minutes
recess
which
afforded
me
an
opportunity
to
introduce
lottie
this
i
lost
no
time
in
doing
miss
wallingford
observed
the
judge
as
he
courtesied
to
her
and
dropped
into
a
seat
by
her
side
you
seem
to
be
deeply
interested
in
those
papers
may
i
inquire
what
they
refer
to
those
papers
refer
to
the
evidence
that
was
in
the
bramlett
case
on
the
first
trial
said
lottie
as
her
pretty
eyes
rested
on
the
handsome
countenance
of
the
judge
oh
yes
that
is
the
case
that
was
set
for
thursday
a
very
strange
case
it
is
indeed
you
are
the
young
lady
who
has
been
staying
in
the
jail
with
miss
bramlett
yes
sir
and
i
am
a
true
friend
to
that
young
well
miss
bramlett
ought
to
be
proud
of
the
friendship
of
such
a
lady
and
i
promise
you
that
your
friend
shall
have
a
fair
and
impartial
trial
i
suppose
you
will
be
present
to
witness
the
proceedings
oh
yes
i
certainly
shall
attend
the
trial
i
should
have
been
present
at
the
first
trial
but
i
was
very
ill
at
the
time
i
have
a
little
favor
to
ask
of
your
honor
which
i
hope
you
will
grant
provided
it
is
not
against
the
rules
of
i
beg
you
to
name
it
miss
wallingford
and
i
promise
in
advance
to
grant
it
if
it
is
within
my
power
even
if
it
requires
a
change
of
our
i
thank
you
sincerely
sir
i
should
like
very
much
to
have
the
privilege
of
some
of
the
state
s
oh
is
that
all
you
shall
all
of
the
state
s
witnesses
if
you
like
and
you
may
make
a
speech
in
defense
of
your
friend
if
you
i
have
no
inclination
to
make
a
speech
i
am
not
a
lawyer
but
i
have
been
studying
miss
bramlett
s
case
there
are
some
very
peculiar
points
in
it
with
which
rockland
is
totally
unacquainted
and
i
have
other
peculiar
reasons
for
wishing
to
some
of
the
mr
quillet
said
the
judge
addressing
that
gentleman
with
a
bland
smile
you
had
better
look
to
your
laurels
next
thursday
for
i
think
you
are
going
to
encounter
heavier
mettle
than
a
defeat
caused
by
miss
wallingford
would
be
as
good
as
a
victory
over
an
ordinary
you
are
quite
complimentary
quillet
you
seem
to
understand
the
weakness
of
our
sex
we
all
love
candidly
speaking
miss
wallingford
i
do
most
sincerely
wish
you
may
be
able
to
furnish
evidence
enough
to
justify
a
jury
in
acquitting
your
indeed
i
thank
you
for
your
kind
wish
and
flatter
myself
that
i
shall
be
able
to
put
a
different
feature
on
the
case
the
next
time
from
what
it
was
on
the
first
trial
on
next
thursday
i
am
going
to
unravel
one
of
the
strangest
mysteries
that
ever
was
revealed
in
open
court
i
will
make
you
think
i
am
a
real
magician
lucio
made
a
duke
out
of
a
friar
and
i
will
make
a
saint
out
of
a
murderess
that
is
i
will
show
a
saint
where
everybody
sees
a
may
god
speed
you
miss
wallingford
the
judge
replied
you
deserve
success
whether
you
achieve
it
or
chapter
xxxii
the
judge
was
so
completely
charmed
by
lottie
s
brilliant
conversation
and
sparkling
wit
that
he
forgot
all
about
the
business
of
his
court
and
consequently
the
thirty
minute
recess
was
prolonged
to
an
hour
and
probably
would
have
gone
on
indefinitely
but
quillet
reminded
him
of
the
mccay
case
which
had
been
set
for
trial
that
day
ah
yes
quillet
said
the
judge
as
he
looked
at
his
watch
and
rose
from
his
seat
i
crave
your
pardon
i
was
so
much
fascinated
with
miss
wallingford
s
conversation
that
i
had
entirely
lost
sight
of
business
she
is
the
most
intellectual
woman
i
ever
met
then
her
beauty
is
equal
to
her
talent
the
truth
is
she
is
an
animated
how
could
she
be
otherwise
after
being
tutored
by
old
rockland
i
hope
she
is
not
as
as
that
old
no
woman
with
such
a
face
as
hers
ever
possessed
a
cold
heart
for
i
think
she
is
the
most
beautiful
woman
i
ever
this
conversation
was
carried
on
in
an
undertone
close
to
where
i
sat
and
notwithstanding
i
had
often
heard
extravagant
encomiums
passed
on
lottie
s
beauty
and
intellect
i
felt
a
sensation
of
pleasure
at
hearing
her
praised
by
a
man
possessing
such
a
solid
mind
as
judge
flipout
i
could
scarcely
realize
the
favors
that
fortune
had
showered
on
me
by
enabling
me
to
win
the
heart
of
a
woman
whose
brilliant
mind
and
dazzling
beauty
had
won
the
admiration
of
all
who
beheld
her
the
state
mccay
said
the
judge
as
he
resumed
his
seat
and
began
to
turn
the
leaves
of
the
trial
docket
ready
for
the
state
replied
quillet
bring
in
the
prisoner
sheriff
observed
the
judge
that
officer
went
into
an
antechamber
and
soon
returned
followed
by
a
little
man
whose
emaciated
appearance
indicated
the
presence
of
severe
illness
he
was
leaning
on
the
arm
of
his
wife
whose
haggard
features
and
sunken
eyes
exhibited
unmistakable
evidence
of
intense
suffering
she
held
a
sickly
looking
infant
against
her
breast
with
one
arm
while
she
supported
her
husband
with
the
other
she
was
followed
by
two
little
girls
about
three
years
old
who
clung
to
the
tattered
skirts
of
the
faded
calico
dress
worn
by
their
mother
they
were
pretty
little
timid
twins
whose
pinched
features
told
a
tale
of
want
misery
and
starvation
as
plain
as
print
who
is
your
attorney
mccay
inquired
the
judge
as
he
began
to
rub
the
left
side
of
his
nose
with
the
forefinger
of
his
left
hand
which
he
always
did
when
vexed
about
anything
i
have
no
attorney
sir
replied
the
defendant
meekly
i
did
not
have
any
money
to
pay
a
lawyer
to
defend
lottie
instantly
rose
and
whispered
to
colonel
buff
a
lawyer
of
considerable
reputation
defend
that
unfortunate
man
colonel
buff
and
i
will
compensate
you
the
attorney
then
stepped
forward
and
announced
himself
as
attorney
for
the
defense
after
the
indictment
was
read
the
prosecuting
witness
was
ordered
to
take
the
stand
he
was
a
large
man
with
a
hangdog
look
on
his
countenance
while
an
offensive
scent
of
mean
whisky
and
tobacco
pervaded
the
atmosphere
for
ten
feet
in
every
direction
from
his
filthy
body
his
evidence
was
in
substance
as
follows
i
was
passing
along
the
street
near
defendant
s
residence
with
a
wagon
loaded
with
bacon
and
when
near
his
house
one
of
the
wheels
of
the
wagon
broke
down
causing
one
of
the
casks
to
roll
out
falling
against
the
it
burst
and
scattered
the
meat
on
the
ground
the
defendant
came
and
proposed
to
purchase
a
side
of
the
bacon
stating
that
his
wife
and
children
were
on
the
verge
of
starvation
caused
by
the
sickness
of
himself
and
wife
i
was
at
first
disposed
to
make
the
trade
with
him
and
perhaps
would
have
done
so
but
i
soon
discovered
that
he
did
not
have
any
money
to
pay
for
the
meat
he
begged
me
to
sell
it
to
him
on
a
short
credit
making
at
the
same
time
a
most
solemn
promise
that
he
would
pay
me
as
soon
as
he
got
able
to
work
i
of
course
declined
to
accept
his
proposition
he
then
offered
to
pawn
his
coat
hat
and
with
me
as
a
security
that
i
should
have
the
money
i
rejected
this
nonsensical
offer
and
went
away
to
get
my
wagon
wheel
mended
at
a
shop
hard
by
when
i
returned
i
noticed
that
one
of
the
sides
of
bacon
had
been
cut
and
a
large
piece
of
it
was
missing
i
went
immediately
to
the
defendant
s
residence
where
i
found
the
stolen
bacon
in
a
pot
which
was
boiling
on
the
fire
i
took
it
and
replacing
it
in
the
spot
where
it
had
been
cut
away
found
it
exactly
fitted
consequently
i
knew
it
was
my
we
rest
our
case
here
if
the
court
please
said
quillet
as
the
villainous
looking
witness
retired
from
the
stand
have
you
any
witnesses
for
the
defense
colonel
buff
inquired
the
judge
we
will
introduce
mccay
for
the
defense
replied
buff
the
poor
woman
staggered
into
the
witness
box
while
the
babe
was
vainly
endeavoring
to
draw
a
little
nourishment
from
her
breast
mrs
mccay
said
colonel
buff
please
tell
the
court
and
jury
all
you
know
about
this
she
wiped
the
fast
falling
tears
from
her
pale
cheeks
with
the
sleeve
of
her
tattered
dress
and
in
a
tremulous
voice
mingled
with
broken
sobs
said
my
husband
is
a
railway
engineer
and
when
he
was
able
to
work
we
did
not
want
for
anything
but
his
health
failed
and
he
was
compelled
to
give
up
his
situation
we
did
not
suffer
for
food
then
until
i
fell
ill
when
we
both
lost
our
health
we
were
driven
to
the
necessity
of
selling
everything
we
had
in
order
to
buy
provisions
and
medicines
our
condition
continued
to
grow
worse
until
we
were
driven
to
the
very
brink
of
starvation
when
a
beautiful
angel
visited
our
humble
home
and
furnished
us
everything
necessary
to
make
us
comfortable
she
continued
to
visit
our
house
every
day
supplying
all
our
wants
and
she
engaged
the
services
of
a
good
kind
doctor
who
came
to
see
us
often
and
gave
us
his
medicine
and
his
kind
attention
so
long
as
that
beautiful
angel
visited
our
home
my
husband
s
health
continued
to
improve
because
she
not
only
furnished
all
the
provisions
and
medicine
that
we
needed
but
she
was
such
a
kind
gentle
nurse
that
we
all
improved
while
she
was
with
us
but
they
put
the
beautiful
angel
in
jail
and
she
never
came
to
visit
us
any
edward
that
was
viola
said
lottie
as
she
seized
my
arm
and
smiled
through
her
tears
heaven
bless
that
dear
girl
do
you
think
now
she
ever
committed
murder
before
the
great
creator
i
declare
she
is
not
guilty
mrs
mccay
paused
a
moment
to
wipe
the
tears
away
while
flipout
put
the
friction
heavy
on
his
nose
my
father
died
continued
the
witness
leaving
an
estate
of
ten
thousand
dollars
and
i
being
his
only
child
was
entitled
to
all
the
money
which
had
i
received
it
would
have
placed
us
beyond
the
reach
of
want
but
the
money
was
paid
into
the
hands
of
anterson
the
public
administrator
who
kept
it
and
refused
to
pay
it
to
if
the
court
please
said
quillet
while
i
deeply
sympathize
with
this
unfortunate
woman
i
must
insist
that
her
statement
can
not
be
admitted
as
evidence
in
this
i
concur
with
my
learned
friend
said
colonel
buff
and
shall
not
insist
on
her
statement
as
testimony
unless
she
can
tell
us
something
directly
bearing
on
the
then
addressing
the
witness
colonel
buff
propounded
the
following
question
mrs
mccay
do
you
know
anything
about
the
slice
of
bacon
that
is
alleged
to
have
been
stolen
my
husband
brought
home
a
small
piece
of
bacon
telling
me
stop
said
quillet
don
t
tell
anything
about
what
your
husband
then
i
have
nothing
more
to
tell
if
you
refuse
to
hear
what
my
husband
said
though
i
know
he
did
not
steal
the
how
do
you
know
he
did
not
steal
it
because
he
told
me
we
ask
your
honor
to
exclude
what
defendant
said
exclaimed
quillet
certainly
replied
the
judge
the
statements
of
defendant
will
not
go
to
the
any
more
witnesses
colonel
buff
inquired
the
court
after
a
hurried
consultation
with
his
client
the
colonel
rose
and
addressed
the
court
if
your
honor
please
i
have
advised
the
defendant
to
withdraw
his
plea
of
not
guilty
and
throw
himself
on
the
mercy
of
the
court
which
he
has
consented
to
do
i
have
been
induced
to
take
this
course
because
the
jury
could
not
consistently
with
their
oaths
acquit
the
prisoner
in
the
face
of
the
evidence
this
is
a
case
which
appeals
in
the
strongest
terms
to
the
mercy
of
the
court
and
i
am
sorry
that
your
honor
does
not
possess
the
power
to
discharge
the
prisoner
because
i
do
conscientiously
believe
the
circumstances
would
justify
your
honor
in
a
course
of
that
kind
and
that
you
would
not
hesitate
to
do
it
if
you
had
the
legal
mr
mccay
said
the
judge
have
you
any
reason
to
urge
against
the
sentence
of
the
court
the
prisoner
rose
to
his
feet
with
trembling
limbs
leaning
against
a
table
to
steady
himself
and
said
the
prosecuting
witness
has
sworn
falsely
i
did
not
steal
his
bacon
he
promised
that
if
i
would
watch
his
property
until
he
could
go
to
the
shop
and
get
his
wagon
wheel
mended
he
would
give
me
enough
of
the
meat
for
our
dinner
i
agreed
to
remain
and
watch
the
wagon
until
his
return
and
with
this
understanding
he
went
away
leaving
me
with
the
property
some
time
after
he
went
away
i
cut
off
a
few
pounds
of
the
bacon
and
carried
it
home
as
i
knew
my
little
children
were
very
hungry
intending
to
go
immediately
back
to
my
post
but
before
i
had
time
to
return
the
witness
came
to
my
house
in
a
great
passion
and
charged
me
with
stealing
the
as
the
unfortunate
man
resumed
his
seat
flipout
began
to
rub
both
sides
of
his
nose
furiously
and
said
the
duty
which
the
law
imposes
upon
me
in
cases
of
this
nature
is
a
very
painful
one
to
perform
i
can
not
escape
it
though
much
i
wish
i
could
the
court
will
take
the
liberty
to
say
that
the
prosecuting
witness
in
this
case
has
shown
himself
to
be
a
cruel
unfeeling
wretch
and
it
is
very
sorry
that
it
has
not
power
to
inflict
upon
him
such
punishment
as
his
meanness
so
richly
merits
the
punishment
in
this
case
is
about
to
fall
on
the
wrong
man
consequently
the
court
will
make
it
as
light
as
possible
the
sentence
of
the
court
is
that
the
defendant
be
imprisoned
in
the
penitentiary
for
two
lottie
now
drew
her
chair
near
a
table
seized
a
pen
and
began
to
write
very
rapidly
and
continued
until
she
had
covered
two
sheets
of
paper
then
she
directed
me
to
hand
it
to
the
judge
he
adjusted
his
spectacles
and
read
the
document
mr
quillet
said
flipout
miss
wallingford
has
prepared
a
truthful
history
of
this
case
with
a
petition
asking
the
governor
to
grant
a
pardon
and
i
shall
sign
it
with
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
and
hope
you
will
do
indeed
sir
you
could
not
ask
me
to
do
anything
that
would
afford
me
more
the
judge
and
quillet
placed
their
signatures
to
the
paper
then
every
lawyer
in
the
room
promptly
stepped
forward
and
signed
it
now
edward
said
lottie
take
this
document
to
the
telegraph
office
have
it
sent
by
wire
immediately
at
my
expense
and
tell
them
to
send
the
answer
to
me
without
i
gladly
obeyed
her
instructions
and
more
than
that
i
hurried
to
rockland
s
office
and
prevailed
on
him
to
send
a
private
dispatch
to
the
governor
requesting
a
favorable
consideration
of
the
petition
knowing
that
the
governor
would
do
anything
reasonable
to
accommodate
his
friend
rockland
as
soon
as
i
had
sent
off
the
dispatches
i
again
made
my
appearance
in
the
supposing
lottie
would
be
ready
to
return
home
but
in
that
respect
i
was
very
much
disappointed
the
next
case
on
the
docket
quillet
is
the
state
against
anterson
said
the
judge
we
are
ready
for
the
state
replied
quillet
is
the
defendant
in
court
sheriff
yes
replied
a
fat
short
man
whose
skin
appeared
to
be
stretched
to
its
utmost
capacity
in
the
effort
to
cover
his
ponderous
body
mr
anterson
then
moved
to
the
front
with
as
much
dignity
as
ever
general
washington
possessed
and
announced
himself
ready
for
trial
he
was
exquisitely
dressed
in
glossy
black
cloth
cut
in
the
most
approved
style
while
a
large
ring
set
with
diamonds
sparkled
on
one
of
his
fingers
and
a
costly
diamond
pin
glistened
on
his
bosom
his
boots
were
polished
until
they
looked
like
the
face
of
a
mirror
and
his
hair
was
sleek
oily
and
neatly
combed
his
little
soft
hands
were
as
white
as
those
of
a
delicate
lady
and
he
was
the
most
innocent
harmless
looking
little
man
i
ever
beheld
the
indictment
charged
this
innocent
little
man
with
embezzling
the
trifling
sum
of
ninety
thousand
dollars
of
money
belonging
to
sundry
widows
and
orphans
of
the
good
city
of
memphis
county
of
shelby
state
of
tennessee
nineteen
other
bills
of
a
similar
character
had
been
presented
against
that
distinguished
little
gentleman
charging
him
with
embezzlement
the
fact
is
he
had
made
a
clean
sweep
of
something
near
three
hundred
thousand
dollars
of
trust
funds
that
had
come
into
his
hands
as
public
administrator
who
are
your
attorneys
in
this
case
anterson
inquired
his
honor
with
a
dignified
wave
of
his
hand
he
pointed
toward
a
dozen
lawyers
who
had
assembled
near
their
distinguished
client
you
seem
to
be
well
supplied
with
attorneys
sir
observed
the
judge
as
he
renewed
the
friction
on
his
nose
my
attorneys
are
not
all
present
yet
sir
said
the
handsome
little
man
but
we
can
send
for
rockland
and
bullger
so
as
to
have
them
here
in
a
few
are
you
ready
to
proceed
with
the
case
now
gentlemen
inquired
flipout
addressing
the
brigade
of
lawyers
i
believe
we
are
ready
replied
fullbrain
a
lawyer
with
large
roman
nose
broad
mouth
and
massive
jaws
this
distinguished
lawyer
was
commonly
called
hogjaw
which
nickname
had
been
suggested
by
the
striking
resemblance
between
his
jaw
and
that
of
a
fat
berkshire
hog
we
make
a
motion
to
quash
the
indictment
in
this
case
if
your
honor
please
said
hogjaw
as
he
held
the
bill
up
before
the
court
state
the
grounds
of
your
motion
if
you
please
fullbrain
exclaimed
the
judge
impatiently
as
he
began
to
warm
up
his
nose
with
his
finger
while
his
keen
black
eyes
sparkled
with
anger
mr
quillet
began
to
pace
up
and
down
the
floor
with
his
hands
thrust
deep
in
his
pockets
while
a
defiant
expression
mantled
his
face
the
clerks
dropped
their
pens
and
moved
to
the
front
so
as
to
witness
the
great
soon
to
be
waged
while
a
motley
crowd
of
idlers
moved
like
an
ocean
wave
toward
the
combatants
eager
to
view
the
interesting
contest
hogjaw
surveyed
the
crowd
for
a
moment
slowly
running
his
eyes
over
the
eager
throng
as
if
inviting
them
to
prepare
for
the
intellectual
banquet
which
he
was
about
to
dish
out
to
them
then
turning
toward
the
court
he
swelled
out
his
brawny
chest
as
if
taking
in
a
supply
of
wind
which
was
to
be
converted
into
a
terrific
tornado
with
which
he
expected
to
blow
the
and
his
little
bill
of
indictment
out
of
the
if
your
honor
please
began
hogjaw
we
think
there
is
a
fatal
defect
in
this
bill
of
indictment
a
patent
incurable
defect
which
must
appear
as
clear
as
the
sun
at
noontide
to
the
mind
of
an
intelligent
court
it
is
a
source
of
indescribable
regret
to
me
sir
to
find
such
a
glaring
defect
in
this
bill
as
we
would
have
greatly
preferred
to
try
this
case
on
its
merits
because
we
are
happy
to
be
able
to
inform
your
honor
that
we
are
prepared
to
vindicate
the
innocence
of
our
client
his
distinguished
reputation
for
honor
and
unblemished
integrity
his
lacerated
feelings
his
wounded
pride
all
cry
aloud
for
redress
we
feel
an
abiding
confidence
in
our
ability
to
clear
our
distinguished
client
with
the
brilliant
array
of
witnesses
who
are
ready
to
testify
to
his
innocence
but
we
find
the
bill
of
indictment
so
fatally
defective
that
we
are
driven
to
the
necessity
of
making
the
motion
to
quash
we
would
gladly
have
avoided
this
course
but
for
the
duty
which
we
owe
to
the
legal
profession
which
tells
us
that
such
mistakes
should
not
be
encouraged
or
countenanced
by
lawyers
who
profess
to
have
such
a
feeling
as
who
is
the
man
intended
to
be
indicted
under
this
bill
yes
who
is
the
man
that
is
the
question
i
dare
to
ask
of
this
honorable
court
this
innocent
much
injured
man
has
been
seized
and
ruthlessly
dragged
away
from
the
bosom
of
his
family
and
treated
as
a
common
malefactor
all
of
which
unpardonable
wrongs
have
been
inflicted
upon
him
by
the
officers
of
the
law
acting
under
a
mistaken
belief
that
the
grand
jury
had
presented
a
bill
of
indictment
into
open
court
against
him
now
sir
i
boldly
assert
in
the
presence
of
this
honorable
court
and
high
heaven
that
no
such
thing
has
ever
been
done
a
thing
a
scrap
of
worthless
paper
is
filed
here
which
ignorant
people
might
be
deceived
into
believing
was
a
bill
of
indictment
but
you
can
not
cram
such
nonsense
into
the
brains
of
sensible
men
my
client
s
name
is
anterson
which
name
i
unhesitatingly
assert
can
not
be
spelled
without
a
and
if
any
man
under
the
blue
vault
of
heaven
will
show
me
a
in
connection
with
the
name
on
this
indictment
why
then
i
promise
to
surrender
the
case
doubtless
the
writer
of
this
bill
was
endeavoring
to
make
a
when
that
little
deformed
animal
was
made
but
i
have
the
temerity
to
assert
that
no
gentleman
with
as
much
as
a
thimble
full
of
brains
in
his
head
or
an
ounce
of
in
his
heart
would
undertake
to
call
that
animal
a
in
open
court
so
far
as
civilization
extends
the
english
language
is
written
and
spoken
and
that
elegant
language
is
composed
of
certain
letters
whose
office
it
is
to
represent
certain
sounds
the
twentieth
letter
in
our
alphabet
is
called
which
letter
is
made
with
a
perpendicular
stroke
of
the
pen
then
a
horizontal
stroke
making
a
cross
near
the
top
end
of
the
upright
line
now
we
all
know
that
the
letter
can
not
be
made
without
the
cross
your
honor
is
doubtless
familiar
with
the
wise
and
charming
compositions
of
the
celebrated
poet
ramsquadlar
whose
reputation
is
with
the
world
that
distinguished
bard
said
when
you
can
extract
the
salt
from
the
sea
then
without
a
cross
can
you
make
a
as
sure
as
fog
doth
rise
the
rain
will
fall
without
a
cross
is
no
at
now
sir
if
that
eminent
poet
was
correct
in
his
beautiful
composition
which
i
presume
no
one
will
be
so
bold
as
to
doubt
i
think
it
settles
the
hash
if
i
may
be
allowed
the
expression
with
the
motion
now
under
consideration
if
a
without
a
cross
is
no
at
all
then
it
follows
as
a
matter
of
course
that
no
legal
indictment
has
been
filed
against
my
client
if
your
honor
concedes
that
the
is
not
crossed
and
that
is
too
plain
to
admit
of
doubt
why
then
of
course
the
motion
to
quash
must
after
haranguing
the
court
for
an
hour
hogjaw
dropped
overcome
with
exhaustion
into
his
seat
while
the
brother
members
crowded
round
him
to
offer
their
congratulations
one
fanned
his
red
face
another
brought
him
a
glass
of
whisky
and
water
a
third
brought
a
napkin
while
all
the
rest
appeared
to
be
anxious
to
render
some
friendly
aid
mr
quillet
delivered
an
eloquent
and
learned
argument
against
the
motion
insisting
that
the
defect
was
such
as
could
be
cured
by
amendment
but
he
was
forced
to
confess
that
the
had
not
been
crossed
it
was
very
plain
to
be
seen
that
the
was
considerably
embarrassed
and
a
lack
of
confidence
appeared
on
his
face
while
his
actions
showed
that
he
had
an
business
as
soon
as
quillet
resumed
his
seat
rockland
who
had
been
silently
watching
the
progress
of
the
argument
stepped
forward
and
began
to
address
the
court
favoring
the
motion
to
quash
he
commenced
by
a
learned
dissertation
on
the
laws
of
creation
which
prevailed
anterior
to
the
existence
of
adam
then
gave
a
graphic
sketch
of
the
rules
which
god
laid
down
for
the
government
of
eden
showing
the
awful
consequences
which
had
resulted
from
a
disobedience
of
those
holy
laws
he
then
came
down
to
the
time
of
moses
giving
a
brilliant
history
of
the
strict
discipline
which
that
great
leader
enforced
in
his
magnificent
army
of
exodusters
while
marching
out
of
the
filthy
land
of
egypt
then
taking
up
the
laws
of
the
medes
and
persians
he
explained
them
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
court
showing
clearly
wherein
they
applied
particularly
to
the
case
under
consideration
the
renowned
advocate
then
paid
his
respects
to
the
koran
citing
many
passages
which
he
insisted
had
a
direct
bearing
on
the
question
now
before
the
court
passing
on
thence
to
the
birth
of
christ
he
descanted
at
large
on
the
meekness
and
suffering
of
the
great
saviour
of
mankind
and
when
he
began
to
advert
to
the
vulgar
mob
of
jews
who
clamored
for
the
innocent
blood
of
christ
he
compared
them
to
the
motley
crowd
of
wretches
who
were
clamoring
for
the
innocent
blood
of
anterson
when
he
plunged
into
the
english
law
he
threw
book
after
book
behind
him
while
he
hurled
precedents
and
quotations
at
the
head
of
the
court
so
thick
and
rapidly
that
the
judge
became
completely
bewildered
after
rockland
had
exhausted
the
laws
of
england
he
made
a
raid
off
the
american
decisions
pouring
a
mighty
deluge
of
learning
into
the
ears
of
the
court
then
wound
up
with
such
a
burst
of
eloquence
as
to
bring
tears
from
the
audience
and
confusion
to
the
mind
of
the
court
he
then
sank
back
in
his
seat
and
wiped
the
perspiration
from
his
brow
and
awaited
the
decision
of
the
court
flipout
dropped
his
head
on
his
hands
and
remained
silent
for
several
moments
evidently
bewildered
and
confused
by
the
vast
waves
of
learning
that
had
rolled
over
him
at
length
he
rose
up
rubbed
both
sides
of
his
nose
with
his
fingers
his
spectacles
coughed
two
or
three
times
looked
up
at
the
ceiling
as
if
he
thought
it
were
going
to
fall
down
on
his
head
then
delivered
the
following
learned
opinion
the
court
has
listened
with
exquisite
pleasure
to
the
lucid
and
learned
argument
made
by
the
attorneys
and
it
feels
profoundly
thankful
to
those
wise
gentlemen
for
the
valuable
assistance
which
they
have
rendered
in
that
respect
this
case
presents
many
strange
and
difficult
features
such
as
we
very
seldom
meet
with
in
this
country
the
court
is
seriously
impressed
with
the
importance
of
this
very
peculiar
case
because
it
involves
the
fortunes
of
many
poor
destitute
widows
and
starving
orphans
the
defendant
is
charged
with
the
embezzlement
of
large
sums
of
money
belonging
to
a
class
of
unfortunate
people
whose
helpless
condition
cries
aloud
to
the
court
for
protection
the
law
is
made
to
restrain
the
strong
and
to
protect
the
helpless
and
it
is
the
duty
of
the
court
to
enforce
the
law
in
such
a
manner
as
to
attain
the
end
which
the
makers
had
in
view
when
the
statutes
were
passed
unscrupulous
men
who
wantonly
trample
on
the
law
should
have
the
severest
penalties
pronounced
against
them
but
we
must
not
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
no
man
can
be
compelled
to
answer
for
a
felony
except
upon
an
indictment
presented
in
open
court
by
a
grand
jury
the
law
presumes
every
man
to
be
innocent
until
such
presumption
is
overthrown
by
competent
proof
and
we
all
remember
the
scriptural
maxim
that
declares
it
is
better
that
guilty
persons
should
escape
than
that
one
innocent
man
should
suffer
this
being
the
case
it
behooves
us
to
exercise
great
caution
in
the
administration
of
the
laws
it
is
contended
by
the
able
counsel
for
the
defense
that
this
indictment
is
fatally
defective
because
the
letter
t
has
no
cross
and
many
learned
decisions
have
been
cited
to
sustain
that
view
the
court
had
occasion
at
a
former
term
to
examine
the
authorities
touching
this
identical
question
and
it
considers
that
a
very
fortunate
circumstance
as
it
will
greatly
aid
the
court
in
arriving
at
a
correct
conclusion
in
regard
to
the
case
now
under
consideration
in
the
celebrated
case
of
hikokolochuckle
lokoklohichuckle
it
was
held
that
all
the
letters
necessary
to
spell
the
defendant
s
name
must
appear
plainly
written
so
that
a
man
of
ordinary
understanding
could
easily
determine
what
name
was
intended
wangdoodle
in
delivering
the
opinion
in
that
case
said
that
it
was
a
deplorable
fact
that
men
of
learning
very
frequently
fell
into
the
despicable
habit
of
neglecting
to
cross
their
and
dot
their
in
the
case
of
changtookoo
which
was
tried
in
the
celestial
empire
before
the
eminent
shooflytoto
it
was
held
that
the
twelfth
letter
in
the
alphabet
was
entitled
to
ten
tails
and
seven
horns
and
that
it
could
not
be
considered
complete
if
either
of
those
tails
or
horns
was
left
off
the
points
decided
in
that
case
appear
to
have
a
direct
bearing
on
the
one
now
before
this
court
the
letter
referred
to
in
that
famous
case
is
not
made
with
a
pen
as
it
is
in
this
country
but
by
drowning
a
large
battle
spider
in
black
ink
and
then
carefully
setting
him
down
on
white
paper
the
legs
of
the
spider
correspond
exactly
with
the
number
of
tails
and
horns
necessary
to
constitute
the
letter
in
the
case
referred
to
it
appeared
that
the
spider
which
was
used
in
making
the
letter
had
unfortunately
lost
a
leg
in
a
combat
with
a
bumblebee
which
was
not
discovered
by
the
writer
consequently
the
letter
had
only
six
tails
when
it
should
have
had
seven
owing
to
that
fatal
defect
the
plaintiff
lost
his
case
which
involved
an
immense
fortune
now
if
the
failure
to
make
all
the
tails
and
horns
rendered
that
letter
defective
it
would
seem
that
a
failure
to
cross
the
letter
in
this
case
would
be
fatal
spotted
tail
the
renowned
indian
chief
in
his
remarkable
communications
to
the
president
of
the
united
states
was
very
careful
to
cross
his
and
dot
his
therefore
it
is
the
opinion
of
this
court
that
if
an
ignorant
savage
can
afford
to
dot
his
and
cross
his
the
attorney
for
the
state
should
be
required
to
do
likewise
entertaining
this
view
of
the
case
the
court
feels
conscientiously
bound
to
sustain
the
motion
let
the
indictment
be
i
suppose
said
hogjaw
that
all
the
other
bills
may
be
considered
as
disposed
of
by
this
judgment
as
they
are
all
in
the
same
category
yes
let
all
the
bills
be
considered
a
grand
rush
was
made
toward
anterson
by
the
lawyers
and
spectators
who
showered
congratulations
thick
and
rapid
every
one
seemed
to
be
eager
to
shake
his
hand
and
to
offer
obsequious
congratulations
the
little
embezzler
was
placed
in
a
carriage
and
driven
to
a
saloon
where
champagne
sparkled
corks
flew
in
all
directions
toasts
were
drunk
and
shouts
of
joy
and
hilarious
laughter
were
wafted
on
the
breeze
the
poor
widow
and
helpless
orphans
went
on
starving
all
the
same
the
world
wags
on
the
sun
continues
to
shine
the
moon
blushes
not
the
rich
robber
revels
in
stolen
wealth
while
justice
spreads
her
white
wings
and
bids
the
world
farewell
the
starving
wretch
who
steals
a
slice
of
meat
to
feed
his
starving
children
must
expiate
the
crime
in
the
penitentiary
while
he
who
steals
a
million
is
champagned
and
worshiped
lionized
and
petted
lottie
gave
me
the
benefit
of
her
opinion
about
courts
lawyers
and
judges
with
a
vengeance
and
that
opinion
was
anything
but
a
compliment
to
that
class
when
court
adjourned
she
beckoned
me
to
follow
her
and
i
knew
from
the
bright
sparkle
of
her
pretty
eyes
and
the
manner
in
which
the
corners
of
her
mouth
hung
down
that
she
had
something
of
importance
to
communicate
i
followed
her
into
a
small
antechamber
adjoining
the
where
i
saw
mccay
weeping
over
her
husband
while
the
two
pretty
little
twins
were
sound
asleep
on
the
floor
oh
charley
said
the
unfortunate
woman
as
she
threw
her
arms
around
her
husband
s
neck
if
they
take
you
to
prison
now
it
will
kill
you
you
have
been
so
ill
and
you
are
now
so
weak
that
you
can
not
live
if
they
start
with
you
to
the
penitentiary
in
your
present
let
me
die
then
why
should
i
care
to
live
in
a
world
that
is
overflowed
with
injustice
i
am
unable
to
work
any
more
therefore
it
would
be
better
for
me
to
be
out
of
the
way
dear
charley
please
do
not
talk
that
way
for
my
poor
heart
is
breaking
if
they
take
you
to
the
penitentiary
they
may
take
me
to
my
grave
for
it
will
kill
me
to
lose
you
they
are
not
going
to
take
him
to
the
penitentiary
yet
a
while
said
lottie
as
she
lifted
mccay
s
little
babe
in
her
arms
i
have
come
to
take
you
and
your
good
husband
home
so
come
along
for
the
carriage
is
waiting
at
the
mrs
mccay
wiped
the
tears
from
her
eyes
and
began
to
stare
at
lottie
in
a
bewildered
manner
we
can
not
go
home
now
because
the
sheriff
was
here
a
moment
ago
and
said
he
would
be
back
soon
to
take
my
husband
to
jail
he
told
me
he
was
going
to
take
charley
to
the
penitentiary
in
the
but
i
tell
you
mccay
that
they
shall
not
take
your
husband
to
prison
he
is
a
free
man
here
is
a
dispatch
from
the
governor
granting
a
full
pardon
and
your
husband
can
go
where
he
pleases
so
come
along
and
get
in
the
carriage
mr
mccay
fell
on
his
knees
at
lottie
s
feet
seized
her
hand
and
pressed
it
to
his
lips
while
his
wife
knelt
on
the
other
side
and
took
the
other
hand
you
are
a
dear
angel
exclaimed
the
weeping
woman
as
she
pressed
lottie
s
hand
to
her
lips
heaven
bless
you
we
will
be
your
slaves
as
long
as
we
live
no
you
will
not
be
my
slaves
either
but
you
shall
be
my
good
the
whole
family
was
crowded
into
the
carriage
which
forced
me
to
take
a
seat
by
the
driver
lottie
directed
the
coachman
to
stop
at
the
nearest
provision
store
where
she
handed
the
salesman
a
bill
of
provisions
with
orders
to
have
them
immediately
sent
to
mccay
s
residence
soon
after
we
deposited
the
family
at
the
front
gate
a
dray
stopped
and
the
driver
began
to
place
the
provisions
on
the
pavement
in
front
of
the
house
a
barrel
of
flour
a
barrel
of
sugar
a
sack
of
coffee
and
a
cask
of
hams
with
numerous
other
packages
were
soon
scattered
about
on
the
pavement
edward
said
lottie
as
she
cast
one
of
her
peculiarly
sweet
smiles
on
me
did
you
ever
read
dickens
on
the
circumlocution
office
yes
i
replied
very
well
then
you
will
understand
my
meaning
when
i
tell
you
i
have
started
a
circumlocution
office
of
my
how
is
that
mr
anterson
steals
ten
thousand
dollars
from
mccay
and
gives
rockland
part
of
the
money
to
keep
him
anterson
out
of
the
penitentiary
rockland
gives
me
the
money
i
purchase
provisions
with
it
and
deliver
them
to
that
is
circumlocution
double
and
twisted
we
then
took
leave
of
the
family
who
had
been
made
happy
by
lottie
s
bounty
and
drove
home
i
attempted
to
embrace
lottie
as
i
assisted
her
from
the
carriage
stop
sir
she
said
remember
the
terms
of
our
compact
no
love
demonstrations
until
viola
is
clear
chapter
xxxiii
at
length
the
long
expected
day
arrived
the
time
to
which
i
had
been
looking
forward
with
a
mind
crowded
with
hope
and
anxiety
the
day
which
was
to
settle
the
fate
of
miss
bramlett
as
well
as
my
own
for
lottie
had
suffered
herself
to
become
so
completely
entangled
with
viola
s
affairs
that
no
power
could
separate
them
i
ate
a
light
breakfast
and
hurried
to
rockland
s
residence
in
order
to
meet
lottie
according
to
previous
arrangement
for
the
purpose
of
escorting
her
to
the
jail
as
she
met
me
at
the
front
portico
with
both
hands
held
out
for
me
to
shake
a
smile
of
unusual
brightness
played
on
her
beauteous
face
while
a
hopeful
confidence
beamed
from
her
pretty
blue
eyes
i
noticed
that
her
toilet
was
exquisitely
arranged
displaying
evidence
of
unusual
care
skill
and
taste
she
was
clad
in
a
robe
of
silk
the
body
cut
so
as
to
exhibit
the
symmetry
of
the
waist
without
encumbering
the
movements
of
the
arms
terminating
close
up
round
the
throat
and
crowned
at
the
top
with
lace
a
large
golden
chain
encircled
her
neck
at
the
end
of
which
was
suspended
a
beautiful
locket
of
the
same
kind
of
metal
containing
a
picture
of
my
unworthy
self
which
was
held
against
her
bosom
by
a
golden
arrow
running
through
a
little
ring
and
fastened
to
her
dress
the
abundant
wealth
of
golden
hair
was
handsomely
braided
and
resting
in
beautiful
coils
at
the
back
of
her
head
being
pinned
up
with
a
cupid
dart
while
an
exquisite
hat
with
two
drooping
plumes
covered
her
head
edward
what
is
the
matter
with
you
this
morning
i
declare
you
look
as
blue
and
solemn
as
if
you
were
in
a
funeral
procession
following
a
dear
friend
to
the
grave
lottie
have
you
no
fears
as
to
the
result
of
the
trial
now
that
is
a
real
yankee
style
of
answering
questions
nevertheless
i
will
give
you
a
direct
answer
i
have
no
fears
but
to
the
contrary
i
am
full
of
confidence
and
hope
this
is
to
be
a
day
of
great
triumph
for
us
but
now
i
wish
to
know
what
makes
you
look
so
melancholy
while
i
am
hopeful
i
am
full
of
doubts
as
to
the
result
and
those
doubts
cling
to
me
despite
my
efforts
to
shake
them
well
all
i
can
say
is
wait
and
see
but
it
is
high
time
we
were
going
for
i
must
have
a
private
interview
with
viola
at
the
jail
before
she
goes
to
the
is
the
carriage
ready
yes
i
saw
it
pass
the
window
just
a
moment
ago
when
we
arrived
at
the
jail
miss
bramlett
embraced
lottie
enthusiastically
uttering
many
endearing
words
of
affection
and
gratitude
her
toilet
was
in
every
respect
exactly
similar
to
lottie
s
and
save
the
color
of
the
hair
they
were
very
much
alike
lottie
requested
me
to
leave
her
alone
with
miss
bramlett
until
the
time
arrived
for
her
to
go
to
the
and
i
went
out
into
the
hall
and
began
to
pace
up
and
down
the
floor
counting
the
moments
as
they
appeared
to
crawl
at
a
snail
s
pace
when
the
two
girls
had
been
together
about
an
hour
a
gentle
rap
sounded
on
the
door
of
miss
bramlett
s
room
and
when
it
was
opened
the
sheriff
said
i
am
ordered
miss
bramlett
to
accompany
you
to
the
you
need
not
be
in
a
hurry
i
can
wait
until
you
are
ready
take
as
much
time
as
you
i
am
ready
sir
as
soon
as
i
can
put
on
my
hat
and
doctor
demar
said
the
sheriff
as
he
came
out
i
will
place
my
fair
prisoner
in
your
custody
and
request
you
to
escort
her
to
the
in
the
carriage
and
i
will
why
not
ride
in
the
carriage
with
us
i
have
too
much
respect
for
miss
bramlett
s
feelings
to
do
anything
that
would
look
like
guarding
a
i
seized
the
hand
of
the
officer
and
thanked
him
for
his
kindness
promising
to
take
the
ladies
as
he
requested
and
he
hurried
away
when
the
carriage
halted
in
front
of
the
an
immense
crowd
of
curious
idlers
began
to
collect
near
the
door
eager
to
get
a
look
at
the
beautiful
murderess
as
they
were
pleased
to
designate
miss
bramlett
and
it
required
the
services
of
a
couple
of
policemen
to
clear
a
road
through
the
dense
mass
of
humanity
for
the
ladies
to
enter
the
door
judge
flipout
who
sat
on
the
judicial
bench
reading
the
morning
paper
laid
it
down
and
gazed
intently
at
the
fair
prisoner
for
a
moment
then
descended
and
taking
miss
bramlett
s
hand
inquired
about
her
health
after
a
few
minutes
conversation
with
her
he
turned
round
and
addressed
lottie
miss
wallingford
have
you
concluded
to
deliver
a
speech
in
defense
of
your
pretty
client
no
i
have
not
but
if
i
were
to
make
a
speech
you
would
hear
new
ideas
expressed
such
as
would
not
be
complimentary
to
courts
lawyers
and
judges
i
used
to
be
simple
enough
to
think
that
courts
were
the
very
fountains
of
justice
where
the
weak
and
helpless
could
procure
redress
for
wrongs
inflicted
on
them
by
the
strong
and
powerful
but
the
scales
of
ignorance
have
lately
been
removed
from
my
indeed
i
am
very
sorry
to
learn
that
you
have
such
an
unfavorable
opinion
of
us
but
i
trust
you
will
alter
it
when
you
know
more
about
i
am
sure
i
should
be
delighted
to
see
something
that
might
be
considered
an
improvement
on
the
farce
i
witnessed
here
the
other
you
must
not
set
those
two
cases
down
as
a
sample
of
what
we
do
all
the
time
because
the
court
was
forced
by
the
law
in
those
cases
to
render
decisions
the
effect
of
which
was
to
enable
guilty
parties
to
then
judge
flipout
again
addressed
miss
bramlett
remaining
by
her
side
a
moment
open
court
sheriff
he
said
as
he
looked
at
his
watch
i
wish
you
a
speedy
delivery
miss
bramlett
as
much
for
miss
wallingford
s
sake
as
for
your
own
you
have
been
quite
fortunate
in
securing
the
friendly
services
of
such
an
astute
then
his
honor
resumed
his
seat
and
listened
to
the
reading
of
the
minutes
while
the
lawyers
began
to
whisper
to
each
other
and
occasionally
point
toward
lottie
and
viola
i
was
close
enough
to
hear
a
whispered
conversation
carried
on
by
hogjaw
and
quillet
in
regard
to
the
two
charming
girls
which
one
is
the
prisoner
inquired
hogjaw
as
he
started
toward
the
ladies
the
one
sitting
nearest
this
way
replied
quillet
there
are
no
evidences
of
guilt
in
that
face
certain
by
jupiter
she
is
pretty
yes
but
i
do
not
think
her
as
beautiful
as
miss
wallingford
i
have
never
laid
my
eyes
on
such
a
model
of
perfection
there
is
an
indescribable
charm
about
the
expression
of
her
features
that
eclipses
anything
i
ever
beheld
just
look
at
that
pretty
golden
hair
did
you
ever
see
anything
like
it
look
at
those
large
blue
eyes
and
that
saucy
dimpled
chin
the
straight
symmetrical
form
the
exquisite
neck
the
rosy
cheeks
stop
quillet
i
cry
enough
you
are
done
for
that
is
plain
that
girl
has
captured
you
beyond
i
would
give
a
california
gold
mine
if
i
could
capture
such
a
woman
for
a
wife
do
you
think
miss
bramlett
is
guilty
i
am
truly
sorry
to
be
compelled
to
say
that
i
do
though
i
do
not
believe
she
was
in
her
senses
when
she
committed
the
why
do
they
not
plead
insanity
then
ah
there
is
where
the
unaccountable
mystery
comes
in
but
i
have
lately
been
informed
that
miss
wallingford
is
in
possession
of
some
very
strange
facts
which
she
believes
will
secure
the
acquittal
of
her
is
it
true
that
miss
wallingford
has
lived
in
the
jail
with
the
prisoner
all
the
time
she
has
been
with
her
most
of
the
time
despite
the
continued
remonstrances
of
old
rockland
and
all
of
her
friends
i
tell
you
what
it
is
that
girl
understands
law
as
well
as
a
majority
of
young
members
of
the
bar
and
we
are
going
to
have
some
rare
fun
here
how
is
that
miss
wallingford
has
secured
permission
of
the
court
to
some
of
the
witnesses
for
the
state
and
i
think
we
shall
see
a
regular
duel
between
her
and
one
of
the
female
well
quillet
you
must
let
miss
wallingford
have
a
fair
indeed
i
will
she
shall
have
her
own
time
and
shall
be
allowed
the
privileges
of
a
regular
member
of
the
i
guess
miss
wallingford
picked
up
her
legal
knowledge
from
old
rockland
s
abundant
store
he
is
a
old
cuss
but
i
regard
him
as
the
best
lawyer
in
yes
and
i
believe
he
hates
everybody
in
the
world
except
his
wife
and
miss
wallingford
and
they
say
he
worships
the
very
ground
on
which
that
girl
walks
he
has
crammed
her
head
full
of
solid
information
and
i
do
honestly
believe
she
is
the
most
intellectual
woman
i
ever
there
comes
old
rockland
now
looking
as
pale
as
a
the
iron
lawyer
moved
slowly
across
the
room
and
dropped
into
a
chair
resting
his
elbows
on
a
table
and
placing
his
face
between
his
hands
he
stared
vacantly
at
space
without
apparently
noticing
anybody
in
the
house
mr
quillet
said
the
judge
are
you
ready
to
proceed
with
the
bramlett
case
we
are
ready
on
the
part
of
the
state
if
your
honor
what
says
the
defense
mr
rockland
straightened
himself
up
gazed
at
the
judge
a
moment
and
ran
his
eyes
slowly
over
the
vast
crowd
of
spectators
then
fixed
his
gaze
on
lottie
as
if
he
were
waiting
for
her
to
answer
the
judge
s
question
yes
papa
she
whispered
tell
the
judge
we
are
i
believe
we
are
ready
for
the
defense
growled
the
old
lawyer
as
he
resumed
his
seat
and
again
rested
his
face
in
his
hands
call
the
sheriff
said
flipout
as
a
frown
began
to
darken
his
brow
occasioned
no
doubt
by
the
confusion
produced
by
the
restless
crowd
who
had
come
in
to
witness
the
proceedings
the
first
juror
who
presented
himself
was
gabriel
mccracken

very
little
man
with
large
red
nose
of
the
roman
type

aside
the
man
called
was
the
first
one
who
had
not
formed
an
opinion
about
the
case
or
anything
else
because
he
did
not
have
sense
enough
to
shape
an
idea
on
any
subject
he
was
a
tall
slim
man
with
weak
watery
eyes
a
starvation
look
resting
on
his
face
and
a
head
covered
with
a
profusion
of
long
tangled
brown
hair
and
an
idiotic
expression
of
countenance

rockland
the
iron
lawyer
waved
his
hand
slowly
toward
the
jury
box
without
looking
up
or
uttering
a
word
and
crookwood
took
his
seat
the
next
juror
who
answered
was
a
negro
with
large
flat
nose
flared
nostrils

man
i
think
this
is
a
competent
juror
if
the
court
what
say
you
for
the
defense
another
careless
wave
of
rockland
s
hand
and
the
juror
was
ordered
by
the
court
to
take
his
seat
in
the
box
it
was
very
clear
to
my
mind
that
rockland
was
perfectly
indifferent
as
to
the
material
being
collected
on
the
jury
and
it
was
also
evident
that
he
regarded
the
entire
proceeding
as
a
mere
matter
of
form
to
be
passed
over
in
order
to
reach
the
inevitable
verdict
of
guilty
against
the
defendant
out
of
a
of
three
hundred
men
they
succeeded
in
securing
a
jury
of
brainless
idiots
and
if
any
man
had
been
bound
by
contract
to
furnish
a
dozen
fit
subjects
for
a
lunatic
asylum
he
could
have
used
that
jury
as
a
legal
tender
for
the
debt
while
quillet
was
reading
the
bill
of
indictment
viola
fixed
her
beautiful
eyes
on
him
and
listened
attentively
and
i
could
see
the
regular
rise
and
fall
of
her
bosom
while
her
breathing
was
as
calm
and
gentle
as
that
of
a
slumbering
infant
not
a
muscle
of
her
face
moved
nor
did
any
evidence
of
fear
or
excitement
manifest
itself
on
her
features
lottie
s
hands
trembled
slightly
as
she
pulled
the
leaves
from
a
rose
and
let
them
fall
at
her
feet
no
other
signs
of
emotion
appeared
the
spectators
and
lawyers
were
listening
in
breathless
silence
anxious
to
hear
what
sort
of
a
plea
the
defendant
was
going
to
put
in
absolute
quiet
reigned
throughout
the
spacious
room
only
broken
by
the
solemn
tones
of
quillet
s
deep
bass
voice
as
he
read
the
awful
charge
of
willful
and
malicious
murder
against
the
beautiful
prisoner
when
he
came
to
the
last
word
in
the
bill
he
turned
from
the
jury
and
fixing
his
keen
black
eyes
on
viola
s
face
paused
for
a
moment
as
the
prisoner
rose
to
her
feet
and
looked
firmly
into
the
face
of
the
it
was
not
a
bold
defiant
stare
but
it
was
such
a
calm
dignified
charming
look
as
i
suppose
the
angels
in
heaven
are
wont
to
cast
on
each
other
miss
viola
bramlett
said
quillet
as
he
bent
forward
are
you
guilty
or
not
guilty
not
guilty
was
answered
in
a
firm
but
sweet
tone
then
commenced
a
tremendous
scramble
among
the
spectators
seeking
to
secure
eligible
seats
so
as
to
hear
the
evidence
flipout
began
to
put
the
pressure
on
his
nose
while
the
dark
frown
on
his
brow
mr
sheriff
exclaimed
the
court
if
you
do
not
instantly
put
an
end
to
this
confusion
the
court
will
impose
a
heavy
fine
on
you
order
those
people
to
sit
down
and
station
a
deputy
at
each
end
of
the
aisle
with
instructions
to
keep
it
clear
and
report
the
names
of
persons
who
disturb
the
business
of
the
court
have
your
witnesses
called
quillet
and
proceed
with
the
as
the
vast
crowd
of
witnesses
began
to
move
to
the
front
i
was
reminded
of
byron
s
vision
of
judgment
wherein
he
gives
such
a
sublime
history
of
the
trial
of
george
iii
when
saint
peter
called
on
satan
for
his
witnesses
the
king
of
darkness
waved
his
hand
down
toward
hell
when
up
rose
a
black
cloud
of
lost
souls
almost
as
numerous
as
the
legions
of
locusts
that
infested
the
shores
of
egypt
now
i
do
not
by
any
means
intend
to
assert
that
the
crowd
of
witnesses
who
came
forward
to
testify
against
viola
bramlett
were
as
numerous
as
the
countless
throng
that
come
up
to
offer
evidence
against
england
s
dead
king
but
i
merely
give
it
as
my
candid
opinion
that
his
satanic
majesty
would
have
scorned
the
idea
of
introducing
into
a
decent
court
such
a
motley
crowd
of
witnesses
as
those
who
appeared
to
swear
against
miss
bramlett
i
do
not
apply
these
remarks
to
all
of
them
however
for
doctors
dodson
and
plaxico
were
of
the
number
i
was
horrified
to
see
ragland
step
forward
and
array
herself
on
the
side
of
the
state
could
it
be
possible
that
viola
s
own
aunt
was
to
be
a
witness
for
the
state
i
looked
at
lottie
to
see
if
any
evidences
of
alarm
appeared
in
her
face
but
nothing
of
the
sort
was
perceptible
all
seemed
calm
as
an
unruffled
lake
while
the
corners
of
her
mouth
were
closely
drawn
down
zip
dabbs
appeared
at
the
head
of
the
long
column
of
witnesses
and
if
he
had
held
the
sun
in
one
pocket
the
moon
in
the
other
the
world
on
his
shoulder
with
the
final
destiny
of
the
entire
human
race
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
he
could
not
have
put
on
a
more
air
than
he
did
on
that
occasion
tadpoddle
appeared
with
his
little
eye
on
duty
while
he
was
making
an
ineffectual
effort
to
imitate
his
illustrious
leader
miss
jemima
tadpoddle
with
her
tall
gaunt
form
looming
high
above
ordinary
women
moved
deliberately
toward
the
clerk
s
desk
and
kissed
the
bible
with
a
smack
as
the
oath
was
administered
by
the
clerk
miss
clattermouth
stood
by
the
side
of
her
tall
friend
looking
like
a
lilliputian
by
the
side
of
gulliver
with
her
little
mouth
handsomely
puckered
as
if
she
were
afraid
that
the
important
facts
known
to
her
would
escape
before
she
got
a
chance
to
tell
them
to
the
jury
as
soon
as
the
clerk
completed
the
task
of
swearing
the
vast
number
of
state
witnesses
the
court
ordered
the
defense
to
call
and
swear
theirs
if
your
honor
please
growled
rockland
as
he
deliberately
rose
up
from
his
seat
i
believe
we
have
no
witnesses
on
the
part
of
the
yes
we
have
papa
said
lottie
in
a
whisper
as
she
plucked
at
rockland
s
sleeve
we
have
some
witnesses
but
we
do
not
wish
to
have
them
sworn
just
then
the
iron
lawyer
stated
to
the
court
that
he
had
just
learned
the
fact
that
the
defense
would
probably
have
one
or
two
witnesses
and
asked
permission
to
have
them
sworn
at
a
later
period
which
was
readily
granted
we
shall
ask
your
honor
continued
rockland
to
order
the
witnesses
under
the
the
court
then
instructed
the
sheriff
to
have
all
the
witnesses
conducted
to
a
comfortable
room
adjacent
to
the
and
to
station
a
reliable
deputy
with
them
with
orders
to
keep
them
together
will
you
insist
on
the
rule
being
enforced
as
to
doctors
dodson
and
plaxico
inquired
quillet
no
said
rockland
we
consent
that
they
may
remain
doctor
plaxico
was
the
first
witness
who
took
the
stand
on
the
part
of
the
prosecution
doctor
plaxico
you
will
please
face
the
jury
and
then
proceed
to
relate
all
the
facts
and
circumstances
connected
with
the
death
of
harry
the
doctor
coughed
two
or
three
times
wiped
his
brow
with
his
handkerchief
ran
his
fingers
between
his
cravat
and
throat
as
if
the
supply
of
air
in
his
lungs
was
about
to
be
exhausted
then
in
a
voice
tremulous
with
emotion
he
began
as
follows
harry
bramlett
died
on
the
night
of
the
of
february
his
death
was
caused
by
poison
administered
to
him
by
some
person
to
me
unknown
death
was
produced
by
strychnine
large
quantities
of
it
being
found
in
the
stomach
of
the
deceased
i
am
a
practicing
physician
and
have
been
actively
engaged
in
that
profession
for
ten
years
past
could
have
saved
the
boy
s
life
if
i
had
been
called
an
hour
sooner
assisted
at
the
autopsy
found
considerable
quantity
of
strychnine
more
than
sufficient
to
produce
if
you
found
any
strychnine
concealed
about
the
premises
please
tell
the
jury
all
about
immediately
after
the
child
expired
i
began
to
examine
the
premises
with
a
view
of
securing
any
evidence
which
would
tend
to
unravel
the
strange
mystery
that
appeared
to
surround
the
affair
the
circumstances
having
directed
my
suspicions
to
stop
doctor
plaxico
said
rockland
don
t
say
anything
about
your
suspicions
if
you
please
just
state
the
facts
that
are
known
to
very
well
i
found
a
small
phial
of
strychnine
in
a
bureau
drawer
that
stood
in
miss
bramlett
s
sleeping
room
which
apartment
adjoined
the
one
in
which
young
bramlett
died
the
phial
was
concealed
in
a
little
secret
niche
on
the
inside
of
a
large
drawer
among
a
great
quantity
of
fine
jewelry
and
upon
very
careful
inspection
i
noticed
that
some
of
the
strychnine
had
been
dipped
out
of
the
phial
with
the
blade
of
a
knife
or
some
other
smooth
substance
which
had
left
its
imprint
plainly
to
be
seen
on
the
surface
of
that
remaining
in
the
phial
when
doctor
dodson
arrived
i
gave
him
a
detailed
account
of
what
had
occurred
and
requested
him
to
grant
me
a
private
interview
which
he
immediately
did
as
soon
as
doctor
dodson
and
i
were
alone
i
proceeded
to
describe
all
the
symptoms
that
had
presented
themselves
in
young
bramlett
s
case
at
the
same
time
informing
him
that
the
child
had
been
doctor
plaxico
said
quillet
be
so
good
as
to
describe
the
conduct
of
miss
bramlett
in
every
particular
from
the
moment
of
your
arrival
until
the
time
you
left
the
when
i
first
arrived
at
the
house
miss
bramlett
appeared
to
be
in
the
deepest
distress
wringing
her
hands
and
weeping
bitterly
but
when
the
boy
expired
she
ceased
to
weep
and
began
to
stare
wildly
about
the
room
as
if
searching
for
something
while
a
strange
inquiring
expression
was
perceptible
on
her
features
i
noticed
that
she
frequently
picked
up
the
little
blue
papers
that
lay
on
the
table
and
examined
each
one
attentively
then
replacing
them
she
turned
round
and
gazed
at
me
with
a
mysterious
look
as
if
she
were
waiting
for
me
to
say
something
she
would
frequently
glance
at
the
door
as
if
she
were
expecting
some
one
to
enter
and
any
noise
seemed
to
frighten
we
now
turn
the
witness
over
to
the
defense
for
said
quillet
you
may
stand
aside
doctor
said
the
iron
lawyer
we
will
not
trouble
you
with
any
we
will
examine
doctor
dodson
now
sheriff
if
you
will
call
him
in
said
quillet
he
is
here
sir
replied
the
officer
as
doctor
dodson
came
forward
and
went
on
the
stand
tell
the
jury
all
you
know
about
the
death
of
harry
bramlett
doctor
dodson
the
cause
of
his
death
and
all
the
circumstances
appertaining
to
the
old
physician
was
greatly
agitated
though
making
a
vigorous
effort
to
conceal
his
emotions
but
with
only
partial
success
a
tear
glistened
in
his
eye
while
his
hands
trembled
and
his
breathing
was
short
and
labored
i
am
a
practicing
physician
was
called
to
see
young
bramlett
a
few
days
before
his
death
ah
ha
and
found
him
suffering
with
ordinary
chills
and
fever
don
t
you
see
ah
ha
well
you
see
it
was
on
the
afternoon
of
february
that
i
prescribed
quinine
making
up
five
doses
i
put
them
in
blue
papers
and
directed
miss
bramlett
to
administer
one
dose
every
two
hours
commencing
at
four
o
clock
ah
ha
don
t
you
see
i
was
again
called
to
visit
the
patient
late
at
night
and
when
i
arrived
was
horrified
to
find
the
child
dead
ah
ha
plaxico
then
requested
me
to
grant
him
a
private
interview
and
when
we
were
alone
he
informed
me
that
the
deceased
had
been
poisoned
with
strychnine
then
i
was
greatly
frightened
thinking
it
possible
that
i
might
have
made
a
terrible
mistake
don
t
you
see
i
instantly
went
and
examined
the
phial
from
which
i
had
taken
the
medicine
which
was
left
on
the
mantel
and
found
it
was
pure
unadulterated
quinine
don
t
you
see
i
then
carefully
inspected
the
contents
of
the
blue
papers
on
the
table
and
found
two
of
them
containing
quinine
just
as
i
had
prepared
them
while
the
other
three
were
empty
i
felt
greatly
relieved
because
i
was
convinced
that
i
had
made
no
mistake
don
t
you
see
how
it
is
yourself
ah
ha
miss
bramlett
said
she
had
administered
the
medicine
exactly
according
to
my
directions
commencing
promptly
at
four
and
when
she
gave
the
third
dose
at
eight
her
brother
soon
thereafter
became
seriously
ill
i
assisted
at
the
examination
and
found
a
large
quantity
of
strychnine
in
the
stomach
enough
to
produce
death
am
satisfied
that
deceased
died
from
what
was
the
nature
of
miss
bramlett
s
conduct
while
you
remained
in
the
room
the
poor
child
appeared
to
be
paralyzed
stunned
as
you
may
say
with
grief
the
fact
is
she
seemed
to
be
perfectly
crazed
by
the
sudden
death
ah
ha
yes
don
t
you
see
she
had
a
frightful
wild
appearance
difficult
to
describe
did
you
question
miss
bramlett
about
the
phial
of
strychnine
that
doctor
plaxico
found
in
her
bureau
drawer
yes
i
asked
her
for
what
purpose
she
had
purchased
the
phial
of
strychnine
she
hesitated
a
moment
and
appeared
to
be
greatly
confused
by
the
question
then
she
said
that
she
would
rather
not
tell
and
i
did
not
urge
her
any
further
i
asked
her
if
any
other
person
had
been
in
the
room
after
i
had
left
the
quinine
and
before
her
brother
suddenly
grew
worse
she
said
that
no
one
had
entered
the
room
so
far
as
she
did
you
examine
the
phial
of
strychnine
if
so
how
much
had
been
taken
out
of
it
a
small
quantity
had
been
dipped
out
with
the
blade
of
a
knife
or
some
other
smooth
instrument
which
had
left
its
imprint
on
that
which
remained
the
phial
had
the
usual
label
on
it
with
the
word
poison
in
large
printed
letters
and
a
picture
of
a
skull
and
crossbones
just

was
permitted

declining

the
famous
philadelphia
detective
was
then
placed
on
the
stand
mr
dabbs
said
quillet
will
you
please
face
the
jury
and
tell
all
you
know
about
the
facts
and
circumstances
connected
with
the
death
of
harry
the
renowned
detective
then
unbuttoned
his
vest
leaned
back
in
his
seat
and
thrusting
his
thumbs
through
the
surveying
the
crowd
for
a
moment
began
as
follows
i
have
for
the
last
ten
years
practiced
my
profession
in
the
city
of
philadelphia
and
was
employed
by
doctor
demar
to
work
up
the
bramlett
case
i
had
been
led
to
believe
that
the
case
was
going
to
be
a
difficult
one
to
manage
and
that
impenetrable
mysteries
and
dangerous
plots
would
have
to
be
encountered
and
mastered
before
a
correct
conclusion
could
be
reached
but
i
do
not
hesitate
to
say
that
during
all
my
successful
career
as
a
detective
officer
i
never
have
met
with
a
case
of
murder
by
poison
in
which
it
was
so
easy
to
spot
the
perpetrator
as
it
has
proved
in
this
we
do
not
want
to
hear
your
opinion
as
to
the
sufficiency
of
your
evidence
dabbs
growled
rockland
tell
what
you
know
about
the
case
and
let
the
jury
weigh
the
that
is
exactly
what
i
was
coming
to
when
you
interrupted
me
while
searching
the
premises
we
succeeded
in
making
many
wonderful
discoveries
all
tending
to
fix
the
guilt
on
miss
stop
sir
exclaimed
rockland
as
anger
flashed
from
his
eyes
if
your
honor
please
we
do
most
earnestly
protest
against
this
manner
of
proceeding
tell
what
you
know
about
the
case
sir
and
let
us
have
none
of
your
opinions
as
to
where
it
fixes
the
very
well
your
honor
said
dabbs
i
was
just
going
to
do
proceed
with
your
evidence
said
quillet
well
as
i
was
telling
you
a
moment
ago
we
made
some
startling
discoveries
while
going
through
the
premises
where
the
murder
was
committed
in
a
large
wardrobe
that
stood
in
miss
bramlett
s
bedroom
we
found
a
blue
silk
dress
which
proved
to
be
the
property
of
that
person
and
in
the
pocket
we
discovered
a
dose
of
strychnine
wrapped
in
a
blue
paper
exactly
similar
in
all
respects
to
those
containing
the
quinine
that
had
been
prepared
and
left
by
doctor
dodson
during
our
very
satisfactory
search
we
discovered
a
small
quantity
say
one
dose
of
quinine
under
the
grate
and
upon
chemical
test
we
found
that
one
of
the
blue
papers
that
had
been
left
by
the
doctor
contained
traces
of
quinine
and
strychnine
both
the
quinine
was
next
to
the
surface
of
the
paper
and
the
strychnine
on
top
of
the
quinine
showing
clearly
that
the
quinine
had
been
emptied
out
of
the
paper
and
the
poison
put
in
its
stead
in
the
pocket
of
miss
bramlett
s
blue
silk
dress
we
found
a
letter
of
a
most
mysterious
character
addressed
to
her
by
a
man
whom
we
have
been
shadowing
all
this
time
an
accomplice
as
we
have
good
reason
to
think
though
the
evidence
against
him
is
not
sufficient
to
warrant
us
in
demanding
his
arrest
as
soon
as
i
got
possession
of
the
letter
and
the
strychnine
i
began
to
make
my
arrangements
to
take
miss
bramlett
by
surprise
hoping
thereby
to
precipitate
her
into
a
confession
i
entered
her
room
in
the
jail
disguised
as
a
bill
collector
being
aided
of
course
by
the
jailer
who
had
orders
to
assist
me
i
began
to
approach
the
subject
which
had
caused
my
visit
after
beating
round
for
some
time
i
threw
off
my
disguise
and
confronted
her
as
the
officer
of
the
law
intending
by
my
sudden
change
to
surprise
her
so
she
would
not
have
time
to
invent
a
lie
miss
bramlett
said
i
as
i
threw
off
my
disguise
you
are
caught
at
last
and
the
best
thing
for
you
to
do
is
to
confess
and
plead
for
i
showed
her
the
letter
and
the
strychnine
that
i
had
found
in
her
dress
pocket
at
the
same
time
demanding
an
explanation
then
sir
commenced
some
of
the
most
splendid
acting
that
i
ever
witnessed
in
all
my
life
i
have
seen
charlotte
cushman
in
guy
mannering
i
have
seen
julia
deen
charlotte
thompson
eliza
logan
and
all
of
our
favorite
actresses
on
the
stage
but
never
has
it
been
my
good
fortune
to
witness
such
splendid
acting
as
that
performed
by
miss
bramlett
on
that
occasion
i
am
willing
to
state
on
my
oath
that
she
seemed
to
grow
at
least
ten
inches
taller
when
i
showed
her
that
letter
and
although
i
could
not
swear
that
real
fire
flashed
from
her
pretty
eyes
yet
something
of
a
strange
light
blazed
from
them
that
i
considered
a
imitation
of
living
fire
the
manner
in
which
she
pointed
to
the
door
and
the
peculiar
tone
of
voice
she
employed
as
she
bid
me
go
through
it
were
indescribably
grand
such
as
if
acted
on
the
stage
would
create
quite
a
sensation
the
language
used
was
of
an
emphatic
nature
and
the
pose
so
sublime
that
it
caused
me
to
forget
my
position
as
an
officer
and
implanted
in
my
mind
a
desire
to
be
somewhere
else
if
however
i
did
for
a
moment
forget
my
position
as
an
officer
i
did
not
lose
my
as
a
gentleman
consequently
i
at
once
made
my
way
through
the
door
at
which
she
was
pointing
extremely
disgusted
with
my
interview
the
very
impressive
manner
in
which
that
young
woman
invited
me
out
of
her
room
had
the
effect
i
confess
to
produce
a
temporary
confusion
causing
me
to
withdraw
rather
hurriedly
and
i
did
not
discover
the
fact
that
i
had
left
the
letter
in
her
possession
until
i
was
out
of
her
presence
as
soon
as
i
could
i
returned
to
her
room
and
requested
her
to
deliver
the
important
document
to
me
but
sir
you
may
imagine
my
astonishment
if
you
can
when
she
pointed
down
at
her
left
heel
which
was
on
the
letter
grinding
it
against
the
floor
yes
sir
she
was
i
will
not
say
dancing
a
jig
on
the
letter
but
she
was
making
a
imitation
of
that
sort
of
sport
if
you
will
take
the
trouble
quillet
to
examine
this
letter
sir
you
will
see
the
print
of
her
on
it
the
words
dear
you
will
observe
have
been
almost
obliterated
by
the
print
of
her
heel
but
i
can
prove
by
doctor
demar
that
dear
was
plainly
written
at
the
top
of
that
mr
quillet
now
took
the
letter
from
dabbs
and
read
it
to
the
jury
she
is
guilty
beyond
all
doubt
whispered
hogjaw
to
quillet
oh
it
is
horrible
to
think
that
such
a
beautiful
creature
could
be
so
cruel
it
will
make
me
suspect
everybody
mr
dabbs
do
you
know
the
handwriting
of
that
letter
being
on
my
oath
and
therefore
bound
to
tell
the
truth
i
regret
to
say
that
i
do
not
but
i
have
a
very
strong
we
care
nothing
about
your
suspicions
said
rockland
be
so
good
as
to
confine
your
statements
to
what
you
very
well
that
is
exactly
what
i
meant
to
do
consequently
i
say
i
do
not
know
who
wrote
that
letter
the
handwriting
has
evidently
been
disguised
and
the
man
i
suspect
is
a
shrewd
rascal
who
understands
the
art
of
deception
and
concealment
of
evidence
we
found
rather
a
singular
contrivance
at
the
back
part
of
ragland
s
vegetable
garden
it
would
perhaps
be
a
misnomer
to
call
it
a
gate
but
nevertheless
it
had
evidently
served
the
purpose
of
one
we
could
see
where
persons
had
often
passed
through
the
soft
earth
on
the
inside
bore
plainly
the
imprint
of
shoe
tracks
one
a
number
eight
the
other
a
number
three
lady
s
what
size
shoe
does
miss
bramlett
wear
she
wears
a
number
three
i
procured
one
of
her
shoes
and
compared
it
with
the
track
and
found
that
the
fit
was
perfect
and
i
do
not
hesitate
to
swear
that
the
track
was
made
by
the
i
cast
a
glance
at
lottie
being
curious
to
know
what
effect
this
startling
evidence
would
have
on
her
but
no
signs
of
emotion
were
visible
on
her
features
she
sat
with
her
pretty
eyes
fixed
on
dabbs
as
if
endeavoring
to
read
his
thoughts
while
the
corners
of
her
mouth
were
both
drawn
down
and
her
lips
firmly
pressed
together
mr
dabbs
was
kept
on
the
stand
for
more
than
an
hour
and
when
he
was
ordered
to
stand
aside
every
vestige
of
hope
had
fled
from
my
bosom
the
proof
of
miss
bramlett
s
guilt
appeared
to
me
to
be
insurmountable
and
overwhelming
mr
tadpoddle
was
then
put
on
the
stand
and
i
noticed
that
he
had
the
little
eye
on
duty
while
the
large
one
calmly
reposed
in
its
hole
a
roar
of
laughter
greeted
the
arrival
of
that
singular
specimen
of
deformed
humanity
tadpoddle
s
evidence
was
nothing
more
nor
less
than
a
confirmation
of
that
given
by
dabbs
but
it
was
all
that
the
court
and
rockland
could
do
to
prevent
him
from
telling
what
his
remarkable
sister
knew
about
the
case
call
in
your
next
witness
exclaimed
flipout
impatiently
as
tadpoddle
left
the
stand
bring
miss
tadpoddle
now
sheriff
said
quillet
as
he
turned
round
and
addressed
the
officer
the
eyes
of
two
hundred
men
were
riveted
on
the
tall
straight
form
of
the
witness
as
she
moved
proudly
down
the
aisle
a
scornful
curl
on
her
thin
bloodless
lips
and
a
haughty
bend
of
her
long
stringy
neck
as
she
flashed
a
glance
of
defiance
at
the
spectators
told
plainly
what
contempt
she
felt
for
all
of
the
human
race
and
that
part
of
it
in
particular
her
costume
was
of
the
flashy
style
the
dress
being
crimson
silk
with
as
much
of
the
material
in
her
train
as
had
been
used
in
the
remainder
of
the
garment
and
as
to
cheap
lace
and
pinchbeck
jewelry
she
looked
as
if
she
had
just
been
in
a
storm
where
such
articles
had
rained
down
on
her
from
the
clouds
she
had
as
much
paint
on
her
face
as
a
comanche
chief
would
have
used
in
three
months
while
on
the
her
hat
contained
all
the
colors
of
the
rainbow
with
the
banner
thrown
in
while
three
tall
plumes
of
different
colors
waved
high
above
her
head
like
those
that
i
had
seen
on
the
hat
of
an
militia
captain
at
a
regiment
muster
take
a
seat
miss
tadpoddle
said
quillet
as
he
pointed
toward
the
chair
and
tell
us
all
you
know
about
the
case
now
on
la
bless
your
soul
sir
if
i
were
to
tell
everything
i
know
about
this
case
it
would
take
me
a
week
now
i
never
exaggerate
or
get
excited
i
am
different
from
other
young
girls
i
despise
exaggeration
you
know
there
are
a
great
many
people
who
would
not
tell
a
lie
under
any
circumstances
yet
they
have
a
despicable
habit
of
exaggerating
everything
very
well
i
am
not
that
sort
of
a
girl
i
always
confine
myself
closely
to
the
truth
without
exaggeration
there
is
my
particular
friend
miss
clattermouth
heaven
bless
her
dear
little
soul
she
is
the
sweetest
creature
in
the
world
though
she
has
fallen
into
the
detestable
habit
of
exaggerating
you
know
her
i
presume
quillet
yes
i
have
heard
her
speak
about
you
very
often
the
fact
is
she
is
a
stanch
friend
of
yours
and
so
am
i
but
let
that
please
tell
us
what
you
know
about
the
bramlett
murder
ah
yes
i
beg
your
pardon
quillet
that
was
the
very
thing
i
was
doing
when
you
interrupted
me
well
you
see
my
sweet
little
friend
clattermouth
came
to
see
me
one
day
and
by
the
by
she
visits
me
very
often
and
we
were
correcting
the
of
her
forthcoming
lecture
which
she
was
going
to
deliver
at
the
next
meeting
of
our
tramp
reform
association
the
subject
of
the
bramlett
murder
came
up
and
miss
clattermouth
was
thinking
that
it
might
be
a
good
idea
to
mention
the
case
in
her
lecture
when
i
said
says
i
jerusha
stop
a
moment
miss
tadpoddle
said
the
judge
as
he
began
to
rub
both
sides
of
his
nose
with
great
vigor
mr
quillet
he
continued
you
will
have
to
propound
direct
questions
to
this
witness
we
can
not
have
the
time
wasted
in
listening
to
this
rigmarole
direct
the
mind
of
the
witness
to
the
facts
you
expect
to
prove
by
her
and
put
a
stop
to
this
miss
tadpoddle
said
quillet
as
he
moved
closer
to
her
if
you
ever
heard
a
conversation
carried
on
between
miss
bramlett
and
benjamin
bowles
in
which
strychnine
was
mentioned
please
tell
all
you
la
bless
your
soul
that
is
the
very
thing
i
was
telling
when
the
judge
interrupted
me
yes
indeed
i
did
hear
them
talking
about
murder
poison
and
many
other
awful
things
that
is
i
heard
miss
bramlett
talking
about
them
but
bowles
was
a
mere
listener
i
inferred
from
what
i
saw
and
heard
that
bowles
was
greatly
annoyed
by
her
strange
questions
about
the
effect
of
strychnine
as
a
poison
the
fact
is
i
think
he
is
a
perfect
gentleman
a
little
wild
i
admit
but
withal
a
man
of
honor
he
has
made
many
liberal
donations
to
our
tramp
reform
association
and
my
friend
miss
clattermouth
says
that
he
promised
to
miss
tadpoddle
exclaimed
the
judge
can
you
not
tell
what
you
know
about
this
case
without
giving
a
history
of
all
creation
la
bless
your
soul
yes
well
go
on
and
do
it
then
that
is
exactly
what
i
was
doing
when
you
interrupted
me
i
was
telling
what
my
friend
miss
clattermouth
said
about
tell
us
what
you
know
about
miss
bramlett
s
connection
with
her
brother
s
death
and
let
bowles
and
miss
clattermouth
miss
tadpoddle
said
quillet
if
you
will
just
answer
my
questions
i
dare
say
we
shall
get
along
much
better
what
did
miss
bramlett
say
to
bowles
about
strychnine
she
asked
him
how
much
strychnine
it
would
require
to
produce
death
and
if
a
doctor
could
tell
when
it
had
been
caused
by
that
sort
of
poison
i
heard
her
say
it
with
my
own
ears
and
i
would
swear
it
on
a
stack
of
bibles
as
high
as
this
and
i
never
exaggerate
either
i
despise
people
who
do
exaggerate
i
told
my
friend
miss
clattermouth
about
it
i
said
says
i
jerusha
says
i
stop
miss
tadpoddle
don
t
tell
what
you
said
but
let
us
hear
what
miss
bramlett
that
is
the
very
thing
i
have
just
told
you
but
if
it
will
do
you
any
good
i
can
tell
it
when
was
it
you
heard
the
conversation
which
you
have
just
mentioned
about
one
week
before
she
poisoned
her
poor
little
where
did
it
occur
in
the
alley
just
in
the
rear
of
bowles
how
did
you
happen
to
see
miss
bramlett
and
bowles
on
that
occasion
well
if
you
must
know
i
was
playing
the
rôle
of
detective
i
had
my
suspicions
aroused
by
a
little
circumstance
that
transpired
previous
to
that
time
and
i
resolved
to
unravel
the
little
mystery
in
other
words
i
made
up
my
mind
to
get
even
with
miss
bramlett
for
she
insulted
me
when
i
asked
her
to
join
our
tramp
reform
association
and
i
determined
to
have
my
revenge
i
told
my
friend
miss
clattermouth
all
about
it
as
soon
as
we
met
and
we
then
began
to
arrange
our
plans
to
expose
that
hussy
i
told
my
dear
friend
says
i
jerusha
says
i
never
mind
what
you
told
your
friend
confine
your
statements
to
what
you
heard
miss
bramlett
that
is
the
very
thing
i
was
doing
when
you
interrupted
if
you
ever
saw
miss
bramlett
go
from
ragland
s
residence
to
the
apartments
of
bowles
tell
all
about
la
bless
your
soul
i
was
telling
that
very
thing
when
you
interrupted
me
yes
i
should
say
i
did
see
her
go
to
the
apartments
of
bowles
the
night
was
quite
dark
and
the
were
very
dim
but
i
was
close
enough
to
see
her
go
through
the
at
the
back
of
the
garden
i
was
determined
to
stick
to
her
until
i
could
find
out
what
she
was
up
to
i
never
give
up
when
i
undertake
anything
i
despise
people
who
always
give
up
when
they
encounter
difficulties
i
followed
her
to
bowles
quarters
and
it
was
after
she
came
out
of
his
apartments
that
i
heard
her
asking
about
the
if
your
honor
please
said
rockland
i
can
not
imagine
what
object
my
friend
has
in
view
by
the
introduction
of
this
rigmarole
it
would
seem
that
the
attorney
for
the
state
had
lost
sight
of
the
charges
contained
in
his
bill
of
indictment
and
was
seeking
merely
to
destroy
the
young
lady
s
let
them
go
ahead
papa
said
lottie
don
t
stop
them
that
is
the
very
thing
we
want
them
to
pshaw
child
you
don
t
know
what
you
are
talking
about
growled
the
iron
lawyer
yes
i
do
papa
let
them
walk
into
the
trap
i
ll
spring
the
trigger
if
the
court
please
said
quillet
we
think
the
evidence
is
competent
in
all
respects
we
have
proved
by
this
witness
that
the
defendant
was
planning
the
murder
a
week
before
it
was
we
withdraw
the
objections
said
rockland
you
may
go
on
with
the
we
are
through
with
the
witness
observed
quillet
and
she
may
retire
unless
you
wish
to
stand
aside
growled
rockland
as
he
waved
his
hand
slowly
no
no
papa
said
lottie
don
t
let
her
go
yet
i
have
some
questions
to
ask
hold
on
a
moment
if
you
please
miss
tadpoddle
exclaimed
rockland
if
your
honor
will
permit
miss
wallingford
to
ask
the
witness
a
few
questions
we
will
esteem
it
a
favor
she
has
been
with
the
defendant
most
of
the
time
and
is
very
familiar
with
the
points
of
the
certainly
certainly
said
the
judge
let
miss
wallingford
ask
as
many
questions
as
she
a
great
sensation
was
caused
among
the
spectators
at
this
new
turn
of
things
and
a
scramble
for
front
seat
ensued
the
crowd
swayed
back
and
forth
while
all
the
lawyers
moved
close
to
lottie
and
gazed
at
her
with
open
mouths
now
the
fun
begins
whispered
quillet
to
hogjaw
miss
tadpoddle
said
lottie
in
a
calm
firm
tone
i
believe
you
said
the
night
you
saw
miss
bramlett
with
bowles
was
very
dark
yes
of
course
i
did
and
i
ll
say
it
again
if
it
will
do
you
any
never
mind
once
will
do
how
did
you
know
it
was
miss
bramlett
if
the
night
was
so
dark
how
did
i
know
it
was
she
yes
how
could
you
know
it
was
miss
bramlett
when
it
was
so
dark
that
you
could
not
see
her
face
i
never
said
i
saw
her
face
the
fact
is
i
did
not
see
her
face
because
she
had
it
concealed
behind
a
heavy
then
how
did
you
know
it
was
miss
bramlett
i
knew
her
by
the
dress
she
had
on
it
was
her
blue
silk
and
i
knew
it
as
well
as
i
know
my
own
silk
because
i
helped
her
alter
it
one
day
it
was
too
short
in
the
skirt
and
i
let
it
out
so
as
to
make
it
the
proper
how
could
you
tell
it
was
a
blue
silk
dress
when
it
was
so
dark
i
followed
her
down
the
street
and
when
she
would
pass
near
a
i
could
see
the
color
of
the
dress
then
the
only
reason
you
have
for
saying
it
was
miss
bramlett
was
because
you
knew
the
blue
silk
dress
no
that
is
not
the
only
reason
by
a
long
jump
i
ll
let
you
what
other
reasons
have
you
besides
the
dress
didn
t
i
see
her
come
out
of
ragland
s
house
and
go
to
bowles
quarters
didn
t
i
see
her
meet
him
in
the
garden
at
another
time
when
i
was
waiting
to
meet
ragland
well
tell
us
about
the
first
time
you
saw
bowles
and
the
woman
together
in
the
haven
t
i
told
it
what
do
you
want
me
to
tell
it
a
dozen
times
for
the
witness
will
answer
the
questions
promptly
said
the
judge
oh
very
well
i
can
tell
it
over
a
thousand
times
if
you
want
it
i
saw
miss
bramlett
meet
bowles
in
the
garden
one
night
about
a
week
before
i
saw
her
go
to
his
did
she
have
on
the
same
blue
silk
dress
the
first
time
you
saw
her
meet
bowles
i
don
t
know
i
was
not
close
enough
to
how
did
you
know
it
was
miss
bramlett
then
the
servant
told
me
that
ragland
had
gone
visiting
and
while
i
was
waiting
for
her
return
i
saw
a
woman
meet
bowles
in
the
garden
and
knowing
that
ragland
was
not
at
home
i
knew
it
must
be
miss
bramlett
now
you
have
then
the
only
thing
that
caused
you
to
think
it
was
miss
bramlett
was
the
fact
that
you
saw
a
woman
in
the
garden
and
having
been
informed
that
ragland
was
not
at
home
yes
i
suppose
that
is
the
way
of
did
you
go
up
to
miss
bramlett
s
room
to
ascertain
whether
she
was
there
or
not
why
should
i
go
up
to
her
room
to
look
for
her
when
i
saw
her
in
the
garden
you
did
not
know
it
was
miss
bramlett
you
saw
in
the
garden
it
might
have
been
some
one
it
might
have
been
somebody
else
but
it
wasn
how
can
you
swear
that
it
was
not
somebody
else
how
many
times
do
you
want
me
to
tell
it
only
haven
t
i
told
you
more
than
once
answer
the
question
madame
said
flipout
while
he
rubbed
his
nose
unusually
hard
what
was
the
question
inquired
miss
tadpoddle
as
she
looked
daggers
at
lottie
i
asked
you
how
you
could
swear
it
was
not
somebody
else
you
saw
in
the
i
never
said
i
could
swear
it
was
not
somebody
very
well
then
can
you
swear
that
it
was
miss
bramlett
you
can
t
make
me
swear
a
lie
if
you
work
on
me
till
gabriel
comes
with
his
trumpet
i
do
not
want
you
to
swear
falsely
i
would
much
rather
hear
you
swear
the
that
is
precisely
what
i
mean
to
do
i
never
exaggerate
i
hate
exaggeration
it
is
my
nature
to
despise
it
miss
tadpoddle
do
you
or
do
you
not
know
who
the
woman
was
that
you
saw
in
the
garden
i
will
not
swear
positively
that
i
did
know
who
she
was
but
i
thought
it
was
miss
when
you
were
playing
detective
that
other
night
what
kind
of
a
gown
did
you
have
on
now
i
should
like
to
know
what
on
earth
you
ask
such
a
question
as
that
for
answer
the
question
thundered
flipout
very
well
if
you
must
know
i
did
not
have
on
any
gown
at
how
did
you
happen
to
be
parading
the
streets
at
night
without
a
gown
did
you
never
see
any
one
clad
without
a
gown
how
were
you
dressed
on
that
occasion
i
had
on
a
suit
of
my
brother
s
clothes
now
then
what
else
do
you
want
to
know
about
it
how
far
were
you
from
bowles
when
you
heard
the
woman
ask
him
about
the
strychnine
i
suppose
i
was
twenty
yards
from
did
you
recognize
miss
bramlett
s
voice
i
wouldn
t
swear
that
i
did
because
i
wasn
t
close
enough
to
do
that
though
i
knew
it
was
she
by
the
what
reply
did
bowles
make
when
she
asked
him
how
much
strychnine
it
would
take
to
kill
i
did
not
hear
his
reply
did
bowles
accompany
the
woman
to
ragland
s
house
he
parted
with
her
in
the
garden
after
kissing
her
a
dozen
times
i
declare
it
made
me
sick
to
see
such
how
did
you
get
into
the
garden
why
i
just
put
one
foot
on
the
railing
and
then
set
my
other
foot
on
the
railing
on
the
other
side
then
i
jumped
over
the
same
as
a
man
does
when
he
gets
off
a
did
you
see
ragland
on
the
first
night
you
discovered
bowles
and
the
woman
in
the
garden
no
i
waited
for
her
until
i
got
tired
then
i
went
you
may
stand
aside
now
said
lottie
then
miss
tadpoddle
gathered
up
her
skirts
and
giving
lottie
a
scornful
look
moved
away
with
long
and
rapid
strides
quillet
whispered
hogjaw
you
have
caught
a
tartar
i
how
is
that
that
miss
wallingford
has
got
a
trap
set
for
some
of
your
witnesses
i
infer
from
the
shape
of
her
questions
i
tell
you
she
is
a
trump
as
sure
as
you
are
born
and
she
will
spring
a
mine
under
your
case
yet
that
will
blow
it
skyward
i
know
by
her
looks
and
the
manner
of
her
questions
that
she
means
mischief
somebody
is
going
to
get
scratched
yet
before
this
case
is
she
lacks
a
great
deal
of
being
a
fool
at
any
rate
and
i
should
be
very
glad
if
she
can
develop
any
facts
that
would
benefit
her
unfortunate
why
did
you
not
have
bowles
arrested
as
an
accomplice
the
proof
against
him
is
not
sufficient
to
convict
though
it
looks
very
suspicious
and
then
i
wanted
to
use
him
as
a
which
witness
will
you
examine
next
said
the
judge
bring
in
benjamin
bowles
sheriff
said
quillet
without
giving
a
direct
answer
to
the
judge
s
question
mr
bowles
walked
forward
with
a
dignified
step
and
serene
countenance
and
took
his
place
in
the
witness
box
as
he
cast
a
scornful
glance
on
the
jury
his
dress
was
fashionable
faultless
and
eminently
exquisite
cut
in
the
most
approved
style
of
dandyism
a
large
diamond
pin
flashed
its
bright
rays
from
his
bosom
and
mingled
with
the
sparkle
of
the
gaudy
rings
on
his
fingers
his
hair
was
very
glossy
richly
perfumed
and
nicely
parted
in
the
middle
while
his
white
cravat
was
tied
in
a
most
beautiful
fashion
there
was
a
look
of
bold
impudence
about
the
countenance
that
amounted
to
an
insult
while
you
could
see
an
indescribable
something
that
convinced
you
that
satan
had
sealed
him
as
his
own
property
mr
bowles
said
quillet
are
you
acquainted
with
miss
viola
bramlett
how
long
have
you
known
her
five
or
six
if
she
ever
asked
you
any
questions
about
strychnine
please
state
what
she
on
several
different
occasions
miss
bramlett
propounded
questions
to
me
of
a
very
startling
character
but
i
do
not
recall
the
exact
words
she
used
i
remember
one
night
about
a
week
before
her
brother
s
death
she
asked
me
if
a
doctor
could
tell
when
any
one
had
been
killed
with
strychnine
she
also
wanted
to
know
how
much
strychnine
it
would
take
to
produce
what
reply
did
you
make
to
such
questions
i
evaded
the
questions
by
changing
the
conversation
to
other
topics
but
she
would
whip
round
and
get
back
to
the
same
subject
she
persisted
in
pumping
me
on
the
subject
until
my
suspicions
were
roused
and
i
avoided
her
after
where
were
you
when
you
had
the
last
conversation
with
her
about
strychnine
she
commenced
the
conversation
at
my
apartments
but
continued
to
talk
on
the
same
subject
after
we
got
into
the
she
had
been
visiting
you
at
your
rooms
then
did
you
ever
meet
miss
bramlett
in
ragland
s
garden
yes
very
if
the
court
please
said
rockland
i
do
most
earnestly
protest
against
this
sort
of
hush
papa
whispered
lottie
as
she
kept
plucking
at
rockland
s
sleeve
let
him
go
on
he
is
already
in
my
trap
and
is
one
of
the
main
birds
i
have
set
the
net
to
catch
we
withdraw
all
objections
to
the
evidence
said
rockland
as
he
resumed
his
seat
and
gazed
inquiringly
at
lottie
what
in
the
name
of
common
sense
do
you
mean
daughter
by
a
trap
set
for
the
witnesses
bowles
has
sworn
to
an
absolute
falsehood
and
i
will
trap
him
before
take
the
witness
rockland
said
quillet
as
he
leaned
back
in
his
seat
thrust
his
hands
in
his
pockets
while
a
smile
of
triumph
played
on
his
handsome
features
i
will
him
whispered
lottie
as
she
began
to
turn
the
leaves
of
a
memorandum
book
which
she
held
in
her
hand
mr
bowles
what
is
your
occupation
i
am
a
please
explain
what
you
mean
by
the
word
sportsman
i
mean
that
i
am
a
turfman
and
follow
the
business
as
an
are
you
not
the
owner
and
proprietor
of
a
gambling
hell
in
this
city
i
don
t
know
that
there
is
any
hell
about
you
need
not
answer
any
question
bowles
that
would
tend
to
criminate
you
said
quillet
oh
i
am
perfectly
willing
to
answer
all
very
good
then
i
will
repeat
the
question
are
you
not
the
keeper
of
a
gambling
house
in
this
city
no
i
am
not
but
i
keep
a
suite
of
rooms
where
my
friends
frequently
assemble
to
engage
in
a
harmless
game
of
cards
merely
for
do
you
run
a
faro
bank
and
a
roulette
table
at
those
rooms
i
am
not
a
faro
dealer
myself
though
such
a
machine
is
sometimes
operated
now
bowles
do
you
swear
that
miss
viola
bramlett
ever
was
inside
of
your
apartments
yes
certainly
i
did
anybody
else
ever
see
her
in
your
quarters
besides
you
i
don
t
think
they
ever
were
you
ever
acquainted
with
a
woman
by
the
name
of
victoria
totten
if
an
adder
had
stung
bowles
in
a
vital
part
he
could
not
have
changed
color
as
quickly
as
he
did
when
the
name
of
victoria
totten
was
mentioned
his
face
which
was
actually
florid
turned
as
pale
as
death
and
his
white
hands
trembled
as
he
put
a
glass
of
water
to
his
lips
his
agitation
however
was
only
temporary
for
he
was
a
bold
villain
who
could
command
himself
under
adverse
circumstances
what
name
was
it
you
asked
me
about
madame
i
asked
you
if
you
ever
knew
a
woman
named
victoria
totten
i
declare
i
don
t
remember
the
names
however
seem
familiar
to
me
but
i
can
t
exactly
call
to
mind
any
acquaintance
of
that
perhaps
i
can
assist
your
memory
a
little
did
you
know
the
widow
totten
who
resided
three
or
four
miles
from
vicksburg
mississippi
who
had
a
daughter
named
victoria
i
don
t
think
i
that
answer
was
made
by
bowles
in
a
tremulous
tone
while
he
showed
signs
of
great
uneasiness
have
you
ever
been
married
bowles
did
you
ever
live
in
new
orleans
with
a
woman
whom
you
represented
to
be
your
wife
if
the
court
please
said
quillet
as
he
sprang
quickly
to
his
feet
i
must
confess
i
can
not
see
wherein
this
kind
of
evidence
can
have
any
connection
whatever
with
this
i
heard
lottie
whisper
to
rockland
as
i
was
sitting
near
her
tell
the
court
papa
said
she
that
we
will
connect
it
with
the
case
very
the
iron
lawyer
then
said
to
the
court
we
think
we
will
be
able
to
connect
this
testimony
with
this
case
and
if
we
fail
then
your
honor
can
rule
it
the
court
can
not
see
the
applicability
of
the
evidence
to
the
case
now
on
trial
but
the
defendant
has
a
right
to
introduce
evidence
in
the
order
chosen
by
her
attorney
i
will
not
give
any
opinion
just
now
but
will
decide
upon
it
when
all
the
testimony
has
been
put
before
the
court
proceed
with
the
what
was
the
name
of
the
woman
whom
you
represented
to
be
your
wife
i
had
rather
not
answer
that
question
as
it
might
compromise
a
lady
s
we
object
to
the
question
said
quillet
we
insist
on
an
answer
said
rockland
while
bowles
changed
from
a
deep
red
color
to
a
deathly
pallor
the
court
will
not
permit
such
questions
to
be
propounded
unless
the
attorney
for
the
defense
can
state
some
reasons
for
inquiring
into
the
private
history
of
a
woman
residing
in
new
the
woman
alluded
to
said
rockland
does
not
reside
in
new
orleans
at
this
time
but
she
is
here
in
the
city
of
memphis
and
miss
wallingford
informs
me
that
we
will
connect
all
this
proof
directly
with
the
case
now
on
in
view
of
that
statement
the
court
will
permit
the
question
to
be
bowles
moved
uneasily
backward
and
forward
in
his
seat
wiped
the
big
drops
of
perspiration
from
his
brow
and
coughed
several
times
as
he
played
with
his
watch
chain
i
could
see
that
his
hands
were
trembling
and
his
face
became
deathly
in
its
pallor
lottie
repeated
the
question
her
name
was
rose
where
is
she
now
i
don
t
mr
bowles
don
t
you
know
that
you
were
living
with
miss
victoria
totten
a
young
girl
whom
you
had
induced
to
elope
with
you
no
i
do
we
have
got
him
safe
in
the
trap
at
last
said
lottie
in
a
whisper
as
she
put
her
mouth
close
to
my
ear
i
remembered
the
time
when
that
identical
scamp
insulted
her
when
she
was
a
helpless
orphan
child
and
how
he
swore
a
lie
against
harry
then
i
thought
of
the
old
adages
chickens
will
come
home
to
roost
every
dog
will
have
his
day
etc
lottie
was
having
her
revenge
now
though
she
was
not
actuated
by
any
feeling
of
that
sort
but
she
was
working
to
save
her
friend
she
took
a
letter
from
her
satchel
and
after
carefully
removing
it
from
the
envelope
handed
the
latter
to
bowles
is
that
your
handwriting
bowles
he
first
held
the
paper
close
to
his
eyes
then
at
arm
s
length
he
next
twisted
himself
round
as
if
he
wanted
some
light
and
wiped
his
brow
hurriedly
i
can
t
say
that
is
i
think
er
er
i
was
not
certain
ahem
i
was
under
the
well
the
writing
looks
a
little
like
mine
though
i
can
t
say

wrote

you
swear
that
you
did
not
write
it
i
i
i
that
is

t
know

t
think

note

mr
quillet
handed
it
to
her
mr
bowles
did
you

note

i
did
mr
bowles
don
t
you
know
that
that
letter
was
intended
for
the
woman
whom
you
represented
to
be
your
wife
and
not
for
miss
viola
bramlett
i
know
nothing
whatever
about
that
don
t
you
know
that
the
woman
with
whom
you
lived
in
new
orleans

same
one

represented
to
be
your
wife

now
living
in
the
city
of
memphis
no
i
do
the
witness
may
stand
aside
said
lottie
as
she
turned
round
and
whispered
to
me
eddie
we
have
got
the
birds
in
the
trap
at
last
i
will
spring
the
trigger
when
the
next
witness
takes
the
chapter
xxxv
the
next
witness
introduced
was
ragland
a
very
beautiful
woman
a
brunette
of
the
guluare
type
she
was
elegantly
attired
in
a
gown
of
drab
silk
with
an
abundant
train
containing
innumerable
flounces
trimmed
with
valenciennes
lace
diamonds
flashed
from
her
bosom
neck
and
arms
and
a
massive
gold
chain
encircled
her
neck
two
or
three
times
at
the
lower
end
of
which
was
fastened
an
exquisite
lady
s
watch
half
concealed
in
a
shallow
pocket
at
her
waist
her
large
dark
eyes
rolled
about
wildly
beneath
very
long
heavy
lashes
there
was
a
mysterious
restlessness
in
the
expression
of
her
great
black
eyes
which
convinced
me
that
she
possessed
a
soul
that
was
a
stranger
to
happiness
mrs
ragland
said
quillet
if
you
ever
saw
miss
bramlett
meet
bowles
please
tell
the
jury
when
and
where
it
i
have
very
often
seen
them
meet
in
our
garden
can
t
say
exactly
how
often
though
i
can
positively
assert
that
they
met
as
many
as
three
times
the
last
time
i
saw
them
meet
was
but
a
very
few
days
before
miss
bramlett
s
little
brother
died
don
t
know
the
exact
date
but
am
sure
it
was
less
than
a
week
before
her
brother
s
if
you
ever
heard
any
conversation
between
miss
bramlett
and
bowles
please
tell
what
was
said
by
each
of
them
i
distinctly
remember
one
occasion
when
i
heard
a
conversation
between
them
but
i
think
that
most
of
the
talking
was
done
by
miss
bramlett
to
the
best
of
my
recollection
it
was
about
the
of
february
at
night
the
weather
was
uncommonly
warm
and
oppressive
i
was
suffering
with
a
severe
headache
and
i
concluded
that
probably
a
stroll
in
the
garden
would
have
the
effect
to
ease
my
sufferings
after
walking
about
in
the
garden
for
some
time
i
went
into
the
and
took
a
seat
on
one
of
the
low
wooden
benches
that
stood
near
the
wall
which
was
covered
with
honeysuckle
vines
under
which
i
was
partially
concealed
i
had
been
there
but
a
few
minutes
when
i
heard
footsteps
sounding
on
the
ground
and
was
very
much
frightened
when
i
discovered
a
man
coming
toward
me
from
the
extreme
rear
of
the
garden
he
approached
to
a
spot
within
five
paces
of
the
and
halting
instantly
gave
a
low
whistle
which
i
suppose
was
a
signal
to
notify
miss
bramlett
of
his
arrival
as
soon
as
he
halted
i
discovered
that
it
was
bowles
i
suppose
he
had
been
there
somewhere
about
five
minutes
when
i
saw
miss
bramlett
coming
from
the
house
she
approached
the
spot
where
bowles
was
and
entered
into
a
whispered
conversation
with
him
all
of
which
i
could
distinctly
hear
she
commenced
the
interview
by
urging
him
to
fulfill
a
promise
of
marriage
which
she
alleged
he
had
made
and
which
he
did
not
deny
he
made
many
protestations
of
love
to
her
which
she
returned
in
very
earnest
language
and
after
the
conversation
had
run
on
the
subject
of
love
and
marriage
for
some
time
she
asked
him
how
strychnine
was
used
to
kill
rats
then
she
brought
the
conversation
round
to
the
effect
such
a
poison
would
have
on
the
human
system
after
a
while
she
put
the
question
to
him
directly
by
asking
him
how
much
of
the
poison
it
would
require
to
kill
a
man
and
then
she
asked
how
much
it
would
take
to
kill
a
child
under
ten
she
also
asked
him
if
a
doctor
could
tell
when
a
person
had
died
from
the
effects
of
strychnine
bowles
endeavored
to
change
the
subject
by
asking
questions
about
other
things
but
she
invariably
whipped
round
and
came
back
to
the
subject
and
persisted
in
talking
about
it
until
bowles
in
an
angry
tone
threatened
to
depart
and
leave
her
unless
she
would
hush
talking
about
poison
viola
said
bowles
i
do
not
like
to
have
you
talk
that
way
it
makes
me
shiver
to
listen
to
it
after
they
had
conversed
there
about
thirty
minutes
he
invited
her
to
accompany
him
to
his
apartments
which
she
consented
to
do
and
passed
out
through
the
garden
and
disappeared
down
the
you
may
take
the
witness
if
you
wish
to
her
said
quillet
have
you
been
friendly
with
miss
bramlett
all
the
time
since
she
came
to
reside
in
your
husband
s
house
i
can
not
say
that
we
were
all
the
time
friendly
for
we
did
frequently
have
little
disputes
about
matters
of
a
trifling
nature
but
i
never
for
a
moment
harbored
any
or
malice
toward
miss
bramlett
i
of
course
did
not
approve
of
her
conduct
and
many
times
have
remonstrated
with
her
about
the
impropriety
of
it
but
instead
of
thanking
me
for
my
good
advice
she
would
fly
into
a
passion
with
that
exception
our
relations
were
mrs
ragland
have
you
not
often
borrowed
large
sums
of
money
from
miss
bramlett
well
i
do
not
know
what
you
would
consider
a
large
sum
of
money
people
have
different
ideas
on
that
subject
you
very
well
then
just
tell
us
how
much
money
you
did
borrow
from
her
i
remember
borrowing
five
hundred
dollars
from
her
on
one
what
did
you
do
with
that
five
hundred
dollars
that
is
none
of
your
business
miss
wallingford
you
have
no
right
to
be
prying
into
my
private
you
must
answer
the
question
madame
said
the
judge
i
could
not
tell
now
to
save
my
life
exactly
what
i
did
do
with
did
you
not
borrow
the
money
expressly
for
benjamin
bowles
no
i
did
not
why
should
i
be
borrowing
money
for
him
that
is
the
very
thing
we
are
endeavoring
to
find
out
did
you
not
borrow
as
much
as
five
hundred
dollars
from
miss
bramlett
on
two
different
perhaps
i
don
t
you
know
you
did
well
yes
i
believe
i
have
you
ever
paid
any
of
that
money
back
no
i
have
about
one
week
before
the
death
of
miss
bramlett
s
little
brother
did
you
not
borrow
from
her
one
thousand
dollars
i
think
i
don
t
you
know
you
did
what
did
you
want
with
it
i
do
not
now
remember
exactly
what
i
did
want
it
did
you
not
borrow
it
for
benjamin
bowles
no
i
did
not
but
i
dare
say
i
got
it
to
pay
for
a
set
of
diamonds
or
something
of
the
were
you
acquainted
with
bowles
before
you
were
married
to
ragland
what
was
your
maiden
name
helen
are
your
parents
living
now
no
they
are
both
where
and
when
did
they
die
in
the
state
of
louisiana
ten
years
were
you
ever
acquainted
with
a
woman
named
victoria
totten
at
the
mention
of
that
name
ragland
s
face
turned
ghastly
pale
and
she
gave
a
sudden
start
as
a
person
would
when
stung
by
a
wasp
but
she
promptly
answered
did
you
ever
reside
in
the
city
of
new
orleans
have
you
ever
been
in
that
city
now
ragland
will
you
state
on
your
oath
that
you
never
did
reside
in
new
orleans
as
the
reputed
wife
of
benjamin
bowles
yes
i
will
and
i
do
not
thank
you
for
asking
me
any
such
a
question
i
do
not
wish
or
expect
any
thanks
from
you
madame
but
i
merely
want
to
get
at
the
truth
ragland
did
you
ever
see
a
copy
of
bolivar
bramlett
s
will
perhaps
i
don
t
you
know
you
have
suppose
i
have
what
does
that
signify
just
answer
the
question
if
you
very
well
then
i
have
seen
a
copy
of
the
did
you
not
send
to
new
york
for
a
copy
of
the
will
and
pay
ten
dollars
for
it
oh
yes
i
declare
i
had
forgotten
all
about
it
yes
i
dare
say
you
had
forgotten
all
about
such
a
trivial
little
circumstance
but
i
want
you
to
tell
the
jury
what
object
you
had
in
view
when
you
paid
ten
dollars
for
a
copy
of
bramlett
s
i
can
not
remember
precisely
what
i
did
want
with
the
copy
but
i
suppose
i
was
prompted
by
sheer
is
this
the
copy
of
the
will
that
you
received
from
new
york
lottie
handed
her
a
large
bundle
of
papers
containing
at
least
a
dozen
sheets
of
paper
covered
with
writing
the
last
one
being
sealed
with
red
wax
to
which
was
attached
a
blue
ribbon
just
below
the
notary
s
signature
this
looks
very
much
like
the
copy
i
received
though
i
could
not
swear
positively
that
it
was
the
identical
document
if
it
is
the
same
paper
some
thief
has
stolen
it
from
my
bureau
drawer
and
i
should
like
very
much
to
know
how
you
got
possession
of
i
dare
say
you
would
and
i
promise
that
you
shall
know
all
about
it
very
soon
who
under
bolivar
bramlett
would
inherit
his
immense
wealth
if
miss
bramlett
and
her
brother
had
both
died
childless
i
believe
it
would
have
come
to
my
don
t
you
know
it
would
yes
i
suppose
i
then
your
husband
would
have
been
the
possessor
of
a
very
large
fortune
if
those
two
children
had
died
childless
yes
i
suppose
that
is
the
way
of
but
you
did
not
want
those
two
children
to
die
and
leave
your
husband
to
be
bothered
with
the
management
of
such
a
large
fortune
i
do
not
know
that
i
ever
gave
a
thought
to
that
well
were
you
not
frequently
in
need
of
money
i
don
t
know
that
i
was
frequently
in
need
of
money
though
i
did
sometimes
borrow
a
little
from
my
why
did
you
not
get
money
from
your
husband
when
you
stood
in
need
of
it
instead
of
borrowing
it
from
miss
bramlett
my
husband
was
not
in
a
condition
to
let
me
have
then
how
did
you
expect
to
pay
the
money
back
that
you
borrowed
of
miss
bramlett
i
do
not
know
that
i
ever
gave
a
thought
to
that
were
you
ever
in
a
gambling
house
on
canal
street
new
orleans
no
i
was
not
and
i
should
like
to
know
why
you
ask
such
absurd
questions
of
me
be
patient
madame
and
it
will
all
be
very
plain
to
you
in
a
short
time
what
number
shoe
do
you
wear
number
lottie
then
opened
a
little
portmanteau
which
the
coachman
had
brought
in
that
morning
and
placing
it
on
the
floor
near
her
took
out
a
pretty
little
number
three
lady
s
boot
and
handed
it
to
ragland
please
examine
that
boot
and
tell
me
whether
or
not
you
ever
saw
it
before
la
yes
indeed
i
have
seen
it
before
it
is
mine
it
was
stolen
from
my
boudoir
and
i
should
like
very
much
to
know
the
you
shall
see
the
thief
before
you
leave
the
stand
but
tell
us
what
is
the
number
of
that
boot
it
is
a
number
three
i
believe
i
know
it
is
too
small
for
me
i
could
not
wear
it
for
that
very
have
you
not
very
often
worn
this
boot
along
with
its
mate
no
i
don
t
think
i
have
because
they
hurt
my
feet
so
that
i
could
not
wear
then
will
you
be
so
good
as
to
explain
how
this
heel
came
to
be
so
much
whetted
off
i
can
not
tell
unless
it
was
done
by
miss
bramlett
as
she
very
frequently
wore
them
because
her
foot
is
smaller
than
mine
and
a
number
three
exactly
fits
are
you
not
wearing
a
number
three
shoe
now
perhaps
i
am
in
fact
i
know
i
am
because
i
was
pressed
for
time
this
morning
and
during
the
confusion
my
maid
put
on
a
pair
of
number
threes
which
i
did
not
notice
until
i
got
out
of
the
carriage
to
come
into
the
and
then
i
found
it
out
because
my
feet
were
being
how
does
it
happen
that
you
have
so
many
number
three
shoes
about
your
house
when
you
say
that
you
only
wear
number
fours
you
know
how
foolish
we
ladies
are
about
the
looks
of
our
feet
and
you
also
know
that
we
very
often
thrust
them
into
shoes
that
are
too
you
admit
then
that
you
are
now
wearing
number
three
shoes
i
see
that
you
have
lost
the
set
out
of
that
beautiful
ring
on
the
third
finger
of
your
left
hand
will
you
be
so
good
as
to
let
me
examine
it
now
i
should
like
to
know
what
you
want
with
one
of
my
rings
you
must
let
miss
wallingford
examine
the
ring
madame
said
the
judge
as
he
leaned
over
his
desk
and
watched
lottie
with
eager
looks
mrs
ragland
took
the
ring
from
her
finger
and
handed
it
to
lottie
at
the
same
time
casting
on
her
a
gaze
of
intense
hate
where
and
when
did
you
lose
the
set
out
of
this
ring
ragland
i
lost
it
somewhere
about
the
of
last
february
but
i
do
not
know
where
i
lost
would
you
recognize
the
set
if
you
were
to
see
it
again
i
would
if
i
were
to
find
it
in
an
african
desert
for
it
is
a
genuine
diamond
for
which
i
paid
three
hundred
did
you
ever
pass
through
a
secret
opening
at
the
back
part
of
your
garden
and
enter
the
street
that
leads
near
it
why
should
i
pass
through
that
way
to
get
into
the
street
when
we
have
two
gates
that
open
into
the
front
street
i
did
not
ask
you
you
did
it
but
i
asked
you
if
you
ever
did
do
it
very
well
miss
then
i
answer
no
did
you
not
frequently
visit
bowles
at
his
apartments
no
i
did
not
and
i
do
not
thank
you
for
propounding
such
questions
to
me
i
am
not
seeking
for
thanks
but
merely
wish
to
get
at
the
facts
did
you
ever
have
an
interview
with
bowles
in
the
in
your
garden
no
i
did
not
what
business
could
i
have
with
bowles
that
is
the
very
thing
we
are
trying
to
find
out
is
this
the
set
that
belongs
to
your
ring
lottie
handed
ragland
a
large
diamond
set
the
same
that
had
been
found
by
the
detectives
la
yes
that
is
the
very
identical
set
that
i
lost
but
i
dare
say
that
the
same
thief
who
stole
my
shoes
took
the
set
out
of
my
ring
look
at
this
picture
madame
and
tell
me
if
you
recognize
it
oh
yes
that
is
a
picture
of
will
you
be
so
good
as
to
tell
the
jury
how
it
happened
to
be
hidden
away
in
your
bedroom
bureau
i
do
not
know
why
you
should
choose
to
employ
the
word
unless
you
take
pleasure
in
making
insulting
insinuations
i
dare
say
the
thief
who
stole
that
picture
might
have
taken
many
others
from
the
same
place
if
she
had
tried
for
i
am
sure
there
were
many
others
there
did
not
bowles
give
you
this
picture
in
exchange
for
yours
which
was
found
in
his
possession
in
the
first
place
i
did
not
know
he
had
my
picture
in
his
possession
for
i
am
sure
i
never
gave
it
to
now
ragland
don
t
you
remember
that
you
had
your
picture
put
in
a
costly
gold
locket
for
the
express
purpose
of
presenting
it
to
bowles
i
do
not
remember
anything
of
the
sort
bowles
may
have
purchased
a
gold
locket
and
he
may
have
bought
one
of
my
pictures
but
i
know
he
never
received
one
from
please
examine
this
locket
ragland
and
then
tell
me
whether
or
not
you
gave
it
to
benjamin
i
never
saw
it
until
this
you
see
that
the
words
from
victoria
to
benjamin
are
engraved
on
the
back
of
this
locket
now
can
you
explain
why
the
name
of
victoria
should
appear
on
this
locket
when
you
swear
that
your
name
is
helen
why
should
you
expect
me
to
be
able
to
explain
it
any
more
than
you
could
when
you
have
just
heard
me
say
that
i
never
saw
that
locket
until
this
moment
bowles
could
very
easily
put
my
picture
in
any
sort
of
a
case
he
pleased
and
if
he
chooses
to
put
it
into
a
locket
containing
another
person
s
name
it
does
not
in
any
manner
disturb
mrs
ragland
do
you
not
know
that
you
had
that
locket
made
to
order
about
two
years
ago
at
the
house
of
clark
if
i
ever
ordered
such
a
job
i
do
not
now
remember
mrs
ragland
don
t
you
know
that
your
maiden
name
was
victoria
totten
and
that
you
lived
in
new
orleans
as
the
reputed
wife
of
benjamin
bowles
no
i
do
not
know
any
such
thing
it
is
my
opinion
that
no
lady
would
ask
a
witness
any
such
insulting
question
but
i
suppose
you
are
anxious
to
play
a
sweet
smile
played
for
a
moment
over
lottie
s
beautiful
face
and
then
resuming
her
usual
calm
composed
demeanor
she
proceeded
with
the
examination
without
evincing
any
signs
of
annoyance
at
the
remarks
mrs
ragland
were
you
ever
acquainted
with
a
widow
lady
residing
a
few
miles
east
of
the
city
of
vicksburg
mississippi
please
examine
this
letter
and
tell
the
jury
whether
you
ever
saw
it
before
or
the
letter
which
lottie
handed
to
the
witness
was
the
one
that
dabbs
said
he
had
found
in
the
pocket
of
miss
bramlett
s
silk
dress
in
which
the
loan
of
five
hundred
dollars
was
mentioned
and
the
same
that
was
signed
with
the
letter
and
directed
to
dear
as
ragland
gazed
at
the
mysterious
letter
her
hands
trembled
violently
while
a
deathly
pallor
spread
over
her
face
this
is
the
first
time
i
ever
laid
my
eyes
on
this
letter
i
suppose
it
was
intended
for
miss
bramlett
as
i
see
that
it
was
directed
to
her
and
i
understand
that
it
was
found
in
her
dress
do
you
recognize
the
handwriting
don
t
you
know
that
it
is
the
handwriting
of
bowles
i
don
t
think
it
is
though
it
somewhat
resembles
his
here
is
another
letter
which
i
want
you
to
examine
and
then
tell
me
if
you
ever
saw
it
mrs
ragland
s
agitation
now
increased
until
her
body
was
shaking
like
one
in
an
ague
fit
while
her
face
lost
all
signs
of
blood
and
the
letter
fairly
rattled
in
her
hand
as
she
attempted
to
read
it
i
never
saw
that
paper
until
this
very
now
ragland
if
you
never
saw
that
letter
before
will
you
be
so
good
as
to
explain
how
it
came
to
be
concealed
in
the
pocket
of
one
of
your
silk
dresses
how
should
i
be
expected
to
explain
how
it
came
there
when
i
did
not
know
it
was
there
and
when
i
did
not
have
anything
to
do
with
it
i
dare
say
miss
bramlett
could
give
you
the
information
you
seek
for
if
it
was
found
in
the
pocket
of
my
dress
you
may
be
sure
she
placed
it
there
in
order
to
avert
suspicion
from
herself
and
to
fix
it
on
me
you
see
that
the
letter
was
directed
to
her
and
as
she
was
in
the
habit
of
wearing
my
dresses
very
frequently
it
may
be
possible
that
she
left
it
there
by
lottie
then
in
a
low
whisper
requested
rockland
to
read
the
letter
to
the
jury
if
the
court
please
said
the
iron
lawyer
as
he
rose
from
his
seat
we
now
offer
the
letter
as
evidence
in
this
case
and
ask
permission
to
read
it
to
the
let
me
examine
it
first
if
you
please
said
quillet
as
he
began
to
exhibit
signs
of
agitation
the
letter
was
handed
to
him
and
after
reading
it
carefully
he
said
we
object
to
the
reading
of
this
letter
as
evidence
unless
it
can
be
clearly
shown
who
wrote
it
and
wherein
it
can
in
any
manner
be
made
to
apply
to
the
case
now
on
we
promise
the
court
replied
rockland
that
we
will
at
the
proper
time
show
who
wrote
it
and
also
make
it
clear
that
it
applies
most
forcibly
to
this
you
may
read
the
letter
said
the
judge
and
if
you
can
make
the
proof
which
you
mentioned
it
may
be
considered
as
competent
evidence
if
you
fail
then
the
court
will
direct
it
to
be
mr
rockland
then
read
the
letter
in
his
deep
solemn
tone
of
voice
which
caused
a
shudder
to
shake
my
body
from
head
to
foot
here
is
the
mysterious
letter
dear
strychnine
as
i
have
often
told
you
is
the
best
medicine
to
rid
you
of
rats
you
may
depend
on
me
to
settle
the
hash
with
the
old
rat
and
i
shall
expect
you
to
do
the
job
for
the
two
young
ones
exercise
caution
and
success
is
certain
be
sure
to
remember
that
the
stakes
for
which
we
play
are
of
immense
value
love
and
fortune
will
be
ours
when
the
task
is
finished
you
will
be
the
richest
lady
in
the
land
and
shall
reign
as
the
queen
of
fashion
as
well
as
queen
of
hearts
a
gilded
palace
in
the
sunny
land
of
italy
shall
be
the
dwelling
place
of
my
beauteous
wife
burn
this
letter
as
soon
as
you
read
it
be
brave
act
promptly
and
we
will
reap
a
rich
reward
i
am
dying
with
impatience
to
clasp
your
dear
form
to
my
heart
yours
and
yours
only
if
ragland
had
been
chained
in
a
lake
of
liquid
fire
the
evidence
of
torture
could
not
have
been
greater
than
that
which
she
exhibited
while
rockland
was
reading
that
letter
her
eyeballs
seemed
to
have
grown
much
larger
while
a
wild
frightened
expression
shot
forth
from
them
and
every
little
jostle
made
by
the
spectators
caused
her
to
start
suddenly
as
if
she
were
badly
frightened
she
insisted
that
the
letter
had
been
placed
in
her
dress
pocket
by
miss
bramlett
in
order
to
divert
suspicion
from
herself
if
said
she
miss
bramlett
could
have
the
heart
to
murder
her
poor
little
brother
it
is
not
at
all
strange
that
she
should
try
to
fix
the
crime
on
some
one
else
in
order
to
save
her
own
mrs
ragland
said
lottie
in
a
tone
full
of
gentleness
did
you
ever
know
a
young
man
named
charles
everson
why
then
did
you
give
such
a
sudden
start
when
i
mentioned
his
name
i
don
t
know
that
i
did
any
such
thing
but
what
if
i
did
is
it
strange
that
i
should
be
nervous
and
restless
under
the
circumstances
by
which
i
am
surrounded
mrs
ragland
did
you
at
any
time
wear
a
blue
silk
dress
that
belonged
to
miss
bramlett
no
i
did
not
why
should
i
borrow
any
of
her
silk
dresses
when
i
had
plenty
of
my
own
that
madame
is
the
very
strange
mystery
which
we
are
endeavoring
to
solve
are
you
willing
to
state
on
your
oath
that
you
never
at
any
time
wore
a
blue
silk
gown
of
miss
bramlett
s
have
i
not
just
now
stated
it
under
oath
how
many
times
do
you
wish
me
to
say
it
mrs
ragland
where
did
you
first
make
the
acquaintance
of
bowles
in
memphis
did
you
ever
live
in
mississippi
no
did
you
ever
meet
bowles
at
vicksburg
mississippi
no
did
you
ever
meet
him
in
new
orleans
no
have
you
ever
met
bowles
outside
of
memphis
no
were
you
ever
engaged
to
be
married
to
any
other
man
than
your
present
husband
no
were
you
ever
in
love
with
any
other
man
than
ragland
no
lottie
then
whispered
to
me
and
requested
me
to
hurry
to
the
library
room
and
call
everson
who
had
been
waiting
there
until
he
should
be
wanted
i
met
with
no
little
difficulty
in
forcing
my
way
back
to
where
lottie
was
but
by
dint
of
vigorous
pushing
and
squeezing
among
the
densely
packed
masses
of
humanity
i
at
length
shoved
my
man
suddenly
in
front
of
ragland
as
soon
as
she
saw
everson
she
sprang
up
from
her
seat
stared
wildly
at
him
for
a
moment
then
throwing
both
hands
up
above
her
head
uttered
a
loud
piercing
scream
fell
back
on
her
seat
and
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
after
holding
her
hands
over
her
face
a
moment
she
let
them
drop
on
her
lap
and
i
noticed
that
her
lower
jaw
had
dropped
down
as
do
those
of
dead
persons
catch
that
lady
there
quick
exclaimed
the
judge
she
is
going
to
faint
mr
quillet
hastened
forward
but
he
was
too
late
for
the
helpless
body
of
ragland
fell
on
the
floor
before
he
got
to
her
the
excitement
among
the
members
of
the
bar
as
well
as
the
spectators
continued
to
increase
until
the
limp
body
of
ragland
was
removed
to
an
adjoining
room
i
never
had
seen
rockland
lose
his
until
that
moment
but
he
managed
to
let
his
heart
have
its
way
then
he
seized
lottie
and
pressed
her
to
his
breast
god
bless
you
my
daughter
no
lawyer
ever
displayed
such
skill
and
shrewdness
as
you
have
and
no
lawyer
ever
received
such
a
fee
as
you
shall
have
in
this
case
my
entire
fortune
shall
be
your
fee
then
he
seized
miss
bramlett
and
pressed
a
kiss
on
her
brow
poor
child
how
deeply
you
have
been
wronged
how
you
have
suffered
for
the
sins
of
another
person
sit
down
papa
said
lottie
as
she
caught
him
by
the
arm
don
t
you
see
how
all
the
lawyers
are
laughing
at
you
let
them
laugh
lottie
i
hope
it
will
do
them
good
i
wish
it
could
make
them
as
happy
as
you
have
made
i
thought
while
the
excitement
was
up
to
fever
heat
that
i
would
slip
through
the
crowd
and
drop
a
kiss
on
my
darling
s
brow
in
order
to
show
the
high
appreciation
i
had
for
her
great
talent
but
she
evidently
divined
my
object
for
she
pushed
me
back
abruptly
and
exclaimed
do
pray
edward
take
a
seat
don
t
you
see
papa
has
gone
crazy
and
i
do
believe
you
are
trying
to
follow
his
example
i
felt
quite
sheepish
because
i
considered
the
rebuke
well
deserved
but
i
took
my
seat
and
with
great
difficulty
managed
to
regain
my
equanimity
colonel
buff
who
was
near
enough
to
hear
what
lottie
said
to
me
gave
me
a
punch
under
the
arm
with
his
thumb
at
the
same
time
making
a
noise
as
a
frog
does
when
he
jumps
into
his
pond
eh
demar
your
boat
struck
a
snag
i
see
well
never
mind
old
fellow
i
saw
from
her
looks
that
she
was
not
do
you
wish
to
introduce
any
more
witnesses
rockland
inquired
the
judge
my
daughter
informs
me
that
she
wishes
to
introduce
her
brother
harry
wallingford
as
a
witness
who
is
now
waiting
in
the
clerk
s
go
after
brother
harry
edward
lottie
whispered
as
she
caught
hold
of
my
arm
and
be
sure
to
caution
him
about
the
control
of
his
temper
much
depends
upon
the
manner
in
which
he
shall
conduct
himself
on
the
when
i
entered
the
clerk
s
office
i
found
wallingford
seated
near
a
table
with
his
face
buried
in
his
hands
and
when
i
spoke
to
him
he
started
up
suddenly
and
endeavored
to
conceal
the
tears
that
he
had
been
shedding
she
is
saved
ed
he
said
in
tone
husky
with
emotion
but
she
is
lost
to
me
forever
i
have
played
such
a
contemptible
part
in
this
affair
as
to
justify
her
in
despising
me
and
to
make
me
hate
myself
i
have
deeply
wronged
her
and
i
must
make
up
my
mind
to
lose
nonsense
harry
said
i
she
loves
you
as
well
as
ever
and
will
be
yours
if
you
will
only
ask
her
but
come
lottie
sent
me
to
bring
you
in
and
she
told
me
to
caution
you
in
regard
to
that
unfortunate
temper
of
i
shall
get
along
all
right
unless
quillet
offers
me
an
insult
that
you
know
i
will
not
submit
to
either
in
or
out
of
you
and
your
case
are
both
gone
up
the
spout
quillet
whispered
hogjaw
as
i
entered
the
room
accompanied
by
wallingford
you
are
defeated
vanquished
quashed
conquered
overthrown
trampled
under
ground
up
and
chopped
into
hash
all
by
a
if
that
girl
would
agree
to
marry
me
replied
quillet
i
think
i
could
forgive
her
and
bear
my
defeat
with
becoming
fortitude
but
i
tell
you
what
it
is
i
mean
to
fight
till
the
death
and
die
bravely
in
the
last
ditch
if
die
i
must
and
though
i
hope
not
hence
unscathed
to
go
who
conquers
me
shall
find
a
stubborn
proceed
with
the
case
rockland
said
the
judge
who
began
to
show
signs
of
impatience
let
wallingford
be
sworn
and
placed
under
the
rule
until
we
examine
everson
said
rockland
that
young
man
then
took
the
stand
he
was
a
young
man
whose
features
contained
unmistakable
evidence
of
untold
sufferings
endured
mr
everson
said
lottie
were
you
ever
acquainted
with
a
young
lady
by
the
name
of
victoria
totten
where
did
you
know
her
at
vicksburg
were
you
acquainted
with
benjamin
bowles
at
vicksburg
when
did
you
last
see
victoria
totten
i
saw
her
a
few
minutes
ago
she
is
the
woman
who
fainted
when
i
came
was
she
ever
married
to
bowles
if
miss
victoria
totten
left
vicksburg
in
company
with
any
one
please
tell
who
it
was
and
under
what
circumstances
she
she
eloped
with
benjamin
bowles
and
they
went
to
new
orleans
where
they
lived
as
husband
and
wife
though
they
never
were
were
you
acquainted
with
victoria
totten
s
mother
where
did
she
reside
near
vicksburg
and
she
is
now
living
can
it
be
possible
that
you
are
mistaken
when
you
say
that
the
woman
who
fainted
on
the
stand
is
the
same
person
you
knew
as
victoria
totten
no
for
i
have
been
well
acquainted
with
her
for
twenty
mr
quillet
suffered
everson
to
stand
aside
without
harry
wallingford
was
then
ordered
to
take
the
stand
which
he
did
with
a
dignified
and
rather
haughty
mien
while
his
eyes
glanced
over
the
crowd
with
a
careless
look
of
indifference
i
noticed
that
he
was
careful
to
avoid
the
gaze
of
miss
bramlett
who
had
her
eyes
eagerly
fixed
on
him
after
gazing
intently
at
him
for
a
moment
her
head
sank
down
on
the
table
that
stood
in
front
of
her
and
i
saw
tears
begin
to
drop
from
her
chin
brother
harry
said
lottie
if
you
are
in
possession
of
facts
that
would
tend
to
throw
any
light
on
the
case
now
on
trial
please
tell
them
in
your
own
i
employed
what
i
thought
was
an
experienced
detective
and
set
him
to
work
on
this
case
he
either
would
not
or
could
not
see
or
believe
anything
that
pointed
to
any
one
else
as
the
guilty
party
but
miss
bramlett
it
is
with
feelings
of
the
deepest
shame
and
mortification
that
i
am
compelled
to
confess
that
he
at
one
time
managed
to
shake
my
confidence
in
the
innocence
of
miss
bramlett
after
becoming
convinced
that
it
was
folly
to
depend
any
longer
on
dabbs
i
concluded
to
take
the
matter
into
my
own
hands
in
order
to
enable
me
to
accomplish
my
purpose
i
secured
the
services
of
a
locksmith
who
undertook
to
manufacture
for
me
such
keys
as
i
might
require
about
ten
days
ago
i
managed
to
enter
the
premises
of
benjamin
bowles
disguised
as
a
farmer
and
after
letting
him
win
a
small
sum
of
money
from
me
i
feigned
intoxication
and
was
permitted
by
him
to
take
a
nap
on
a
sofa
in
an
adjoining
room
but
while
he
thought
i
was
sound
asleep
i
was
busy
taking
wax
impressions
of
all
the
locks
and
keys
of
the
apartments
as
well
as
all
trunks
bureaus
wardrobes
etc
having
accomplished
the
object
of
my
visit
i
hurried
to
my
locksmith
and
ordered
him
to
make
the
keys
necessary
to
enable
me
to
open
the
locks
which
he
proceeded
to
do
immediately
the
next
day
i
paid
a
visit
to
the
residence
of
ragland
disguised
as
a
gardener
and
was
so
fortunate
as
to
secure
a
job
of
work
in
her
flower
garden
which
i
managed
to
accomplish
to
her
satisfaction
she
went
down
town
shopping
taking
her
maid
with
her
leaving
no
one
on
the
premises
except
the
cook
and
myself
i
managed
to
enter
the
house
through
a
back
door
which
was
left
unlocked
i
proceeded
to
take
wax
impressions
of
every
lock
and
key
i
could
find
on
the
premises
and
gave
them
to
my
locksmith
and
soon
i
was
prepared
with
keys
to
fit
them
being
armed
with
my
false
keys
i
managed
to
enter
the
apartments
of
bowles
at
a
time
when
i
knew
he
was
away
from
home
i
succeeded
in
making
a
thorough
search
of
all
his
rooms
trunks
bureaus
dressing
cases
wardrobes
and
carefully
examined
all
of
his
papers
i
spent
three
consecutive
days
and
nights
in
bowles
establishment
in
a
bureau
drawer
that
stood
in
his
sleeping
room
i
found
a
large
gold
locket
containing
the
picture
of
ragland
on
the
back
of
the
locket
the
words
from
victoria
to
benjamin
were
plainly
engraved
after
i
had
finished
my
inspection
of
the
apartments
of
bowles
i
turned
my
attention
to
the
residence
of
ragland
where
i
found
many
curious
things
among
which
were
several
letters
from
benjamin
bowles
one
of
these
letters
mentioned
strychnine
as
a
good
poison
for
is
this
the
letter
to
which
you
refer
said
lottie
as
she
handed
a
paper
to
her
brother
yes
i
found
that
letter
in
the
pocket
of
a
silk
dress
which
belonged
to
if
you
ever
saw
this
boot
before
said
lottie
as
she
handed
it
to
him
please
tell
when
and
where
you
saw
it
about
five
days
ago
i
brought
that
boot
from
ragland
s
sleeping
room
while
searching
a
trunk
in
ragland
s
bedroom
i
found
several
pictures
of
benjamin
bowles
one
of
which
was
incased
in
a
golden
shell
handsomely
inlaid
with
pearls
i
brought
the
picture
away
and
have
it
here
now
this
picture
was
wrapped
up
in
a
letter
which
i
have
read
it
said
rockland
dear
i
herewith
send
you
my
picture
according
to
promise
which
i
had
taken
when
you
were
so
good
as
to
give
me
the
pretty
image
of
your
dear
self
i
tried
to
make
the
present
more
acceptable
by
putting
it
in
a
costly
case
and
if
you
knew
how
highly
i
prize
the
dear
image
of
your
sweet
self
which
you
condescended
to
give
me
you
would
no
doubt
value
my
ugly
picture
more
than
you
do
i
am
sorry
indeed
to
be
compelled
to
tell
you
that
i
am
just
now
in
a
terrible
strait
for
the
want
of
funds
luck
has
been
giving
me
the
cold
shoulder
for
the
last
fortnight
and
you
must
by
all
means
try
to
wheedle
miss
bramlett
out
of
another
thousand
for
me
and
i
shall
soon
be
able
to
make
a
rise
with
it
the
little
scheme
that
i
have
so
often
mentioned
to
you
is
a
feasible
one
which
will
insure
us
a
great
fortune
and
richly
reward
us
for
any
risk
though
there
can
be
no
risk
if
we
exercise
caution
when
rats
annoy
us
why
not
destroy
them
have
you
any
other
facts
to
communicate
said
lottie
if
you
have
please
one
night
while
i
was
concealed
in
a
bathroom
in
the
apartments
of
bowles
he
was
visited
by
a
woman
whose
face
i
did
not
see
but
whose
voice
i
readily
recognized
as
that
of
ragland
she
arrived
there
about
nine
o
clock
and
remained
until
after
the
clock
struck
twelve
when
she
went
away
accompanied
by
bowles
while
they
remained
in
the
room
adjacent
to
the
one
in
which
i
was
concealed
i
could
distinctly
hear
everything
they
said
when
ragland
first
entered
the
house
she
threw
herself
into
the
arms
of
bowles
exclaiming
oh
ben
let
us
fly
before
it
is
too
late
for
suspicion
has
already
begun
to
point
her
finger
at
me
what
a
fortunate
thing
it
was
that
i
happened
to
wear
miss
bramlett
s
blue
silk
dress
that
night
when
miss
tadpoddle
was
watching
me
she
thinks
it
was
miss
bramlett
and
will
swear
in
open
court
that
it
was
yes
replied
bowles
and
that
makes
it
necessary
for
us
to
swear
the
same
for
heaven
s
sake
ben
replied
ragland
do
not
i
beseech
you
ask
me
to
add
the
awful
sin
of
perjury
to
the
long
list
of
crimes
that
i
have
committed
pshaw
vick
we
have
crossed
the
dead
line
long
ago
and
it
is
too
late
to
talk
about
retreating
now
never
will
i
move
an
inch
toward
the
rear
i
will
win
by
boldness
and
audacity
if
we
were
to
attempt
to
fly
now
it
would
insure
our
destruction
for
we
could
not
escape
do
as
i
tell
you
dear
vick
and
i
will
vouch
for
a
favorable
ah
ben
you
know
too
well
how
i
love
you
and
you
also
know
how
much
i
would
suffer
and
endure
to
serve
and
please
you
but
there
is
a
mysterious
influence
which
i
can
not
describe
that
constantly
whispers
strange
words
into
my
mind
telling
me
that
my
days
are
numbered
and
that
i
shall
soon
be
called
to
render
an
account
of
my
sinful
come
vick
don
t
be
so
silly
i
declare
you
are
continually
talking
about
retribution
and
repentance
if
all
the
wealth
of
the
world
belonged
to
me
i
would
willingly
give
it
for
a
clear
conscience
oh
ben
let
us
quit
our
wicked
ways
ere
it
is
forever
too
late
for
i
believe
that
i
shall
not
live
much
longer
a
sort
of
presentiment
whispers
of
death
to
me
continually
stop
stop
vick
i
swear
i
will
not
listen
another
moment
to
this
sentimental
nonsense
come
let
us
go
in
and
take
some
champagne
and
then
you
will
feel
they
then
went
into
another
room
and
remained
until
midnight
when
ragland
went
home
accompanied
by
wallingford
was
then
turned
over
to
quillet
for
the
usual
smooth
temper
of
the
had
been
considerably
ruffled
by
the
taunts
and
jeers
that
had
been
thrown
at
him
by
the
other
members
of
the
bar
and
notwithstanding
he
had
lost
all
hopes
of
sustaining
the
prosecution
he
had
resolved
to
have
his
revenge
which
he
thought
he
could
best
secure
by
handling
harry
wallingford
with
gloveless
hands
as
soon
as
he
commenced
the
i
could
tell
from
his
manner
and
the
tone
of
his
voice
that
he
meant
to
cut
deep
and
i
also
knew
that
he
was
treading
on
very
dangerous
ground
when
he
undertook
the
job
mr
wallingford
he
said
in
an
imperative
tone
i
should
like
you
to
tell
us
by
what
authority
you
ventured
to
enter
the
apartments
of
ragland
and
without
her
knowledge
or
consent
carry
off
private
property
belonging
to
her
i
did
it
sir
by
the
authority
which
god
gives
to
all
men
in
order
to
enable
them
to
protect
innocence
and
expose
are
we
to
understand
sir
that
you
had
a
commission
direct
from
god
empowering
you
to
enter
a
lady
s
private
chamber
by
false
keys
and
without
her
consent
carry
off
her
private
property
the
shape
of
your
question
sir
carries
with
it
an
insult
and
i
think
it
would
be
advisable
for
you
to
modify
i
ask
your
pardon
said
quillet
smiling
sarcastically
i
assure
you
sir
i
did
not
think
of
insulting
you
but
really
i
had
a
curiosity
to
know
what
prompted
you
to
take
the
law
into
your
own
hands
in
such
a
presumptuous
manner
as
the
shape
of
the
question
seems
to
displease
you
and
as
i
should
dislike
very
much
to
incur
your
displeasure
i
will
take
your
advice
and
change
the
shape
of
the
question
what
induced
you
to
interest
yourself
in
miss
bramlett
s
affairs
and
why
did
you
choose
to
spend
so
much
money
for
her
because
i
loved
her
sir
and
because
i
believed
she
was
innocent
as
wallingford
uttered
those
words
his
voice
trembled
slightly
while
his
proud
soul
seemed
to
be
standing
in
his
eyes
was
not
miss
bramlett
at
one
time
betrothed
to
you
yes
is
she
now
betrothed
to
you
no
did
you
cancel
the
engagement
no
did
she
do
it
yes
why
did
she
do
it
because
she
found
me
to
be
unworthy
of
her
love
and
miss
bramlett
started
as
if
she
were
going
to
rise
from
her
seat
then
dropped
her
head
back
on
the
table
did
you
concur
with
her
views
in
that
respect
yes
why
did
you
continue
to
work
in
her
interest
after
she
had
discarded
you
to
gratify
my
sister
and
win
the
approval
of
my
is
your
conscience
easy
now
no
why
not
because
i
wronged
an
innocent
lady
by
my
unjust
the
excitement
by
this
time
had
been
wrought
up
to
fever
heat
and
i
could
plainly
see
that
an
explosion
was
imminent
unless
something
was
done
to
prevent
it
stand
aside
wallingford
exclaimed
flipout
in
a
tone
that
convinced
quillet
that
no
further
trifling
would
be
allowed

xxxvi
harry
passed
out
of
the
witness
box
and
left
the
without
looking
toward
viola
which
it
was
plain
to
see
was
a
great
disappointment
to
her
for
she
followed
him
with
her
eyes
until
he
disappeared
and
then
gave
vent
to
her
feelings
in
tears
who
is
your
next
witness
we
have
sent
for
ragland
s
maid
as
we
have
just
been
informed
by
wallingford

she
is
in
possession
of
some
important
facts
connected

about

eight
o
clock
miss
bramlett
came
into
the
kitchen
to
get
some
tea
for
her
little
brother
and
requested
me
to
go
after
a
cup
and
saucer
that
were
in
young
master
bramlett
s
room
when
i
got
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
i
saw
ragland
in
the
room
she
had
one
of
the
blue
papers
of
medicine
in
her
hand
she
laid
it
down
among
the
other
papers
and
went
out
through
miss
bramlett
s
did
she
see
you
on
that
occasion
i
don
t
think
she
did
you
ever
see
ragland
dressed
in
one
of
miss
bramlett
s
gowns
yes
very
often
i
assisted
her
to
put
on
a
blue
silk
dress
which
belonged
to
miss
where
did
your
mistress
go
when
she
had
on
miss
bramlett
s
blue
silk
dress
she
went
to
meet
bowles
at
the
and
then
accompanied
him
to
his
what
was
ragland
s
maiden
name
victoria
the
loud
report
of
half
a
dozen
pistol
shots
in
rapid
succession
now
came
ringing
through
the
causing
a
stampede
among
the
spectators
who
made
a
rush
for
the
door
go
quick
eddie
said
lottie
as
she
seized
my
arm
while
her
whole
body
trembled
run
quick
it
is
bowles
and
harry
policemen
came
running
in
from
all
directions
shouting

thief

the
murderer

the
villain
where
is
he
what
has
happened
quillet
demanded
flipout
who
had
rubbed
his
nose
until
it
was
as
red
as
fire
ben
bowles
made
an
attempt
to
assassinate
harry
wallingford
but
i
am
happy
to
inform
your
honor
that
no
serious
harm
has
been
done
though
the
scoundrel
bowles
has
succeeded
in
effecting
his
escape
he
met
wallingford
at
the
door
as
he
went
out
and
slapped
him
on
the
mouth
then
both
parties
began
to
shoot
at
each
other
and
wallingford
received
a
slight
flesh
wound
in
the
left
arm
and
bowles
fled
he
knocked
a
man
down
in
the
streets
and
took
the
horse
that
the
man
was
holding
mounted
and
went
north
at
full
if
your
honor
please
said
the
prosecuting
officer
i
think
it
is
my
duty
to
perform
which
will
afford
me
great
pleasure
to
enter
a
in
this
case
being
convinced
that
this
young
lady
is
innocent
she
has
suffered
too
much
already
and
i
am
unwilling
to
allow
her
to
spend
another
night
in
i
am
much
obliged
replied
rockland
to
my
honorable
friend
for
his
kind
offer
but
we
would
prefer
to
have
a
verdict
from
the
very
well
then
replied
quillet
let
miss
bramlett
accompany
her
friends
home
and
she
can
return
in
the
morning
to
hear
the
verdict
i
consent
to
any
plan
that
will
be
agreeable
to
her
and
her
as
soon
as
ragland
recovered
from
the
swoon
into
which
she
had
fallen
the
judge
ordered
the
sheriff
to
remove
her
to
her
home
at
the
same
time
instructing
that
officer
to
have
the
premises
securely
guarded
until
her
condition
should
be
such
as
to
justify
her
imprisonment
edward
said
lottie
as
she
smiled
through
her
tears
i
want
you
to
assist
viola
into
the
carriage
and
you
had
better
escort
her
home
and
when
you
have
done
so
you
will
return
here
as
speedily
as
possible
in
order
to
help
me
get
harry
home
let
mother
understand
that
harry
is
not
severely
hurt
and
that
there
is
no
cause
whatever
for
alarm
go
now
and
attend
to
these
things
as
quickly
as
you
after
escorting
miss
bramlett
home
i
hurried
back
to
help
bring
harry
we
had
to
carry
him
to
the
carriage
as
he
was
not
able
to
walk
without
assistance
his
face
was
as
white
as
it
could
have
been
if
he
had
been
dead
are
you
suffering
very
much
brother
harry
lottie
inquired
as
she
drew
his
head
down
so
as
to
let
it
rest
on
her
bosom
oh
no
not
at
i
want
you
to
tell
me
why
you
did
not
look
at
or
speak
to
viola
this
evening
when
you
came
in
the
did
you
not
notice
how
your
conduct
distressed
her
my
dear
sister
don
t
you
know
that
i
could
not
look
in
that
dear
girl
s
face
if
death
was
to
be
the
penalty
of
the
refusal
you
certainly
must
know
how
deep
is
the
feeling
of
contempt
that
she
has
for
i
am
convinced
that
you
have
entirely
misjudged
miss
bramlett
s
feelings
toward
you
for
i
happen
to
know
that
she
is
anxious
for
a
reconciliation
and
she
would
not
hesitate
to
make
the
first
advances
if
she
were
not
afraid
of
being
sister
you
seem
to
have
lost
sight
of
the
fact
that
i
am
a
pauper
though
i
trust
you
do
not
expect
me
to
be
a
beggar
miss
bramlett
s
great
fortune
has
rendered
any
thought
of
a
marriage
between
us
impossible
beside
this
i
do
not
believe
i
could
ever
be
to
her
such
a
husband
as
she
deserves
i
have
lately
received
a
letter
from
my
attorney
at
san
francisco
informing
me
that
he
has
discovered
evidence
which
leads
him
to
think
that
my
uncle
stanley
made
a
later
will
and
that
after
all
there
is
a
probability
that
the
property
was
left
to
me
he
advises
me
to
come
there
immediately
and
it
is
my
intention
to
do
so
as
soon
as
i
am
able
to
endure
the
fatigues
of
the
journey
if
it
should
be
my
fortune
to
inherit
my
uncle
s
estate
i
will
then
be
in
a
condition
to
sue
for
miss
bramlett
s
the
carriage
now
drew
up
to
the
front
gate
and
rockland
who
had
been
watching
for
us
seized
harry
in
her
arms
and
burst
into
tears
harry
had
been
supported
from
the
front
gate
to
the
house
by
lottie
and
me
as
we
thought
he
was
too
weak
to
walk
alone
but
as
soon
as
he
came
to
the
steps
at
the
front
portico
he
suddenly
disengaged
himself
from
us
and
briskly
ran
up
into
the
hall
the
exertion
proved
too
heavy
a
tax
on
his
strength
for
i
noticed
that
he
began
to
reel
miss
bramlett
who
was
watching
him
from
the
parlor
door
sprang
quickly
forward
and
caught
him
in
time
to
check
the
force
of
the
fall
but
her
strength
was
not
sufficient
to
entirely
prevent
it
when
i
got
to
him
i
discovered
that
he
had
fainted
but
miss
bramlett
was
sitting
on
the
carpet
holding
his
head
on
her
bosom
by
this
time
lottie
came
running
in
and
snatching
a
bottle
of
hartshorn
from
the
mantel
she
directed
miss
bramlett
to
hold
it
to
his
nostrils
then
she
moistened
her
brother
s
pale
face
with
eau
de
cologne
and
in
a
few
moments
i
saw
signs
of
returning
life
appear
i
was
about
to
lift
wallingford
in
my
arms
with
a
view
of
placing
him
on
a
bed
when
lottie
suddenly
seized
me
by
the
arm
and
pulled
me
into
the
nearest
room
come
away
edward
she
whispered
as
she
hurried
me
along
let
them
alone
don
t
you
see
how
tenderly
she
is
nursing
him
we
took
up
a
position
in
the
adjacent
room
where
we
could
observe
them
through
an
open
window
wallingford
opened
his
eyes
and
as
they
met
those
of
miss
bramlett
a
convulsive
shudder
shook
his
body
for
a
moment
then
he
closed
them
and
remained
silent
a
long
time
when
he
again
opened
his
eyes
i
noticed
that
they
were
filled
with
tears
he
is
weeping
whispered
lottie
as
she
gave
my
arm
a
vigorous
pinch
thank
heaven
she
continued
all
is
chapter
xxxvii
soon
after
the
court
opened
next
morning
i
was
considerably
surprised
to
see
zuleka
zenobia
come
hurriedly
into
the
room
and
deliver
a
large
yellow
envelope
to
rockland
my
mistress
requested
me
to
deliver
this
paper
to
you
immediately
after
the
court
met
this
morning
said
zuleka
as
she
put
the
envelope
in
rockland
s
hand
the
iron
lawyer
deliberately
commenced
reading
the
contents
of
the
letter
i
imagined
that
his
hands
began
to
tremble
slightly
and
i
thought
i
could
see
a
perceptible
deepening
of
the
color
on
his
face
if
the
court
please
said
he
i
hold
in
my
hand
a
most
extraordinary
paper
which
has
just
been
handed
to
me
by
ragland
s
maid
this
document
makes
a
most
startling
disclosure
i
do
not
think
the
contents
of
this
letter
ought
to
be
made
public
until
an
officer
shall
have
been
sent
to
inquire
about
perhaps
her
maid
can
enlighten
you
as
to
the
condition
of
her
mistress
s
health
observed
flipout
mr
rockland
then
asked
the
maid
if
she
had
seen
her
mistress
that
morning
no
said
the
maid
i
have
not
seen
her
since
eleven
o
clock
last
night
she
rang
for
me
at
eleven
and
gave
me
the
envelope
and
told
me
to
deliver
it
to
rockland
at
ten
o
clock
this
mr
sheriff
said
flipout
send
a
deputy
to
ragland
s
residence
immediately
and
instruct
him
to
report
her
condition
to
the
court
without
at
last
a
short
dumpy
little
deputy
with
a
ponderous
nose
and
bushy
hair
came
dashing
into
the
room
with
a
face
very
pale
and
excited
manner
if
your
honor
please
ragland
is
dead
sir
she
has
killed
herself
the
door
was
locked
on
the
inside
and
we
had
to
break
it
open
before
we
could
get
in
we
found
her
lying
on
the
bed
cold
and
stiff
with
your
honor
s
permission
said
rockland
i
will
now
read
this
letter
which
will
explain
read
it
said
the
judge
mr
rockland
dear
sir
when
you
read
these
lines
the
hand
that
wrote
them
will
be
cold
in
death
and
my
soul
will
have
appeared
before
its
creator
perhaps
god
will
have
mercy
on
my
sinful
soul
for
he
alone
knows
how
i
was
tempted
and
betrayed
and
he
i
hope
will
have
pity
on
a
poor
unfortunate
wretch
like
me
there
was
a
time
when
i
was
an
innocent
artless
confiding
girl
the
petted
child
of
doting
parents
i
was
the
only
daughter
of
alexander
totten
who
died
when
i
was
thirteen
leaving
a
small
fortune
though
ample
for
the
support
of
myself
and
my
mother
it
is
useless
to
warn
other
giddy
girls
to
avoid
a
fate
like
mine
because
until
men
change
their
natures
unsuspecting
girls
will
continue
to
listen
to
the
honeyed
words
of
the
libertine
and
the
villain
my
great
fault
the
one
that
led
me
to
destruction
was
a
love
of
display
and
a
fondness
for
theatres
balls
and
all
kinds
of
frivolous
amusements
bowles
drove
fast
horses
and
spent
money
freely
dressed
in
style
and
took
me
with
him
to
all
the
balls
and
other
places
of
amusement
within
reach
it
would
be
folly
to
undertake
to
describe
the
manner
in
which
i
went
step
by
step
from
the
temple
of
honor
to
the
gulf
of
infamy
it
would
merely
be
a
reiteration
of
the
old
story
i
did
not
leap
from
the
high
temple
of
honor
to
the
bottom
of
the
infamous
pit
at
a
single
bound
but
i
went
down
by
slow
degrees
until
i
was
at
the
very
bottom
i
have
committed
a
most
cruel
murder
oh
that
i
had
died
when
i
was
an
innocent
babe
oh
god
have
mercy
on
my
sinful
soul
my
only
hope
is
based
on
the
boundless
mercy
of
him
who
knows
how
i
was
tempted
miss
viola
bramlett
is
as
pure
as
an
angel
and
has
suffered
innocently
for
a
crime
committed
by
me
when
she
and
her
little
brother
came
to
live
at
our
house
bowles
began
to
speak
of
the
large
fortune
that
had
been
left
them
by
their
father
he
told
me
that
if
the
two
children
should
happen
to
die
i
would
be
the
richest
lady
in
the
land
at
first
he
spoke
of
the
matter
cautiously
but
in
such
a
manner
as
to
create
a
hope
in
my
mind
that
such
a
thing
might
happen
he
informed
me
that
my
husband
s
habits
of
dissipation
would
soon
put
him
out
of
the
way
and
that
if
the
children
were
to
die
all
the
property
would
be
mine
this
matter
formed
the
topic
of
his
conversation
every
time
we
met
and
it
was
a
long
time
before
he
developed
his
murderous
designs
while
we
lived
in
new
orleans
bowles
kept
a
gambling
hell
and
often
he
induced
me
to
entice
men
into
it
to
be
drugged
and
robbed
step
by
step
he
led
me
down
down
down
until
all
conscience
all
virtue
all
honor
was
gone
i
was
frightened
when
he
first
began
to
persuade
me
to
ensnare
his
unsuspecting
victims
but
i
soon
became
familiar
with
crime
and
embraced
vice
with
pleasure
how
truly
did
pope
describe
things
when
he
said
vice
is
a
monster
of
so
frightful
mien
as
to
be
hated
needs
but
to
be
seen
yet
seen
too
oft
familiar
with
her
face
we
first
endure
then
pity
then
oh
how
accurately
those
four
lines
describe
the
circumstances
in
my
case
i
never
loved
ragland
and
would
not
have
married
him
but
i
thought
bowles
was
dead
at
the
time
i
became
his
wife
my
love
for
bowles
had
by
no
means
diminished
since
my
marriage
with
ragland
and
we
met
very
often
sometimes
in
the
and
frequently
i
went
to
his
quarters
miss
tadpoddle
was
mistaken
when
she
said
she
saw
miss
bramlett
go
to
bowles
apartments
it
was
i
dressed
in
viola
s
blue
silk
which
i
had
ordered
my
maid
to
steal
for
me
the
paper
of
strychnine
found
in
the
pocket
of
the
blue
silk
dress
was
placed
there
by
me
the
understanding
between
bowles
and
me
was
that
i
was
to
put
the
children
out
of
the
way
so
that
my
husband
would
inherit
the
great
fortune
then
he
bowles
was
to
dispatch
ragland
and
we
were
to
be
married
and
reside
in
italy
i
stole
into
the
room
when
i
knew
miss
bramlett
was
in
the
kitchen
preparing
some
tea
for
her
little
brother
and
finding
the
child
sound
asleep
i
hurriedly
emptied
the
quinine
out
of
one
of
the
blue
papers
and
put
the
strychnine
in
it
and
replaced
it
on
the
table
that
was
the
fatal
dose
that
killed
the
boy
i
do
not
ask
or
expect
forgiveness
from
the
citizens
of
memphis
because
it
will
require
a
higher
power
to
absolve
me
i
think
i
can
muster
courage
to
die
unloved
and
unmourned
by
any
but
i
have
not
enough
to
enable
me
to
live
in
the
face
of
the
tornado
of
indignation
which
i
know
would
confront
me
in
this
community
but
for
the
awful
load
of
guilt
that
presses
like
a
great
mountain
on
my
soul
i
would
quit
this
cruel
world
without
regret
i
suppose
that
one
who
has
committed
so
many
cruel
crimes
as
i
have
would
not
be
considered
a
proper
person
to
give
advice
to
others
but
the
rich
man
who
lifted
his
voice
up
in
hell
was
anxious
that
his
brothers
should
not
come
where
he
was
and
i
who
am
about
to
appear
before
my
god
with
the
stain
of
murder
on
my
soul
would
gladly
persuade
others
to
shun
a
fate
like
mine
when
you
hear
that
i
have
inflicted
on
myself
the
same
kind
of
murder
that
i
did
on
harry
bramlett
using
the
same
deadly
drug
you
will
doubtless
conclude
that
i
have
gone
mad
but
no
the
hand
that
directs
this
pen
is
as
steady
as
it
ever
was
and
the
mind
that
manufactures
these
thoughts
is
as
clear
i
would
prefer
to
live
and
repent
of
the
awful
crimes
i
have
committed
but
i
know
that
the
law
would
cry
aloud
for
my
blood
the
letter
that
was
found
in
miss
bramlett
s
dress
pocket
was
placed
there
by
me
or
rather
it
was
left
there
by
mistake
when
i
returned
the
dress
it
was
written
by
bowles
and
addressed
to
me
instead
of
miss
bramlett
as
was
believed
by
the
detectives
i
shall
instruct
my
maid
to
deliver
this
communication
into
your
hands
when
court
opens
in
the
morning
and
i
most
humbly
ask
you
to
read
it
to
the
court
and
jury
in
order
that
all
suspicion
of
miss
bramlett
s
guilt
may
be
removed
i
am
sorry
that
this
is
all
the
reparation
i
can
make
for
the
great
wrongs
i
have
done
to
that
innocent
girl
with
a
full
knowledge
of
the
fact
that
i
shall
soon
stand
before
my
great
creator
i
declare
the
foregoing
statement
to
be
true
victoria
take
the
jury
to
a
room
sheriff
and
let
them
make
up
their
verdict
and
return
it
into
court
as
soon
as
at
last
the
jury
came
in
with

you
agreed
on
a
verdict

water
from
his

with
the

of
his
coat
read
the
verdict
i
don

think
i

the
clerk

the

was
kind
enough
to
transcribe
for

after

changed

form

lottie

rockland

bright
morning

me
what

to
do
with
that
money

am
going
to
give

inferred

much
but
you
had
better
not
let
her
have
it
all
at
once
give
it
to
her
in
small
sums
as
she
needs
it
but
what
about

may
trust

matter
entirely
to
very
good
i
shall
expect

many
more

you
the
iron
lawyer
drew
her
fondly
to
his
heart
stamped
a
kiss
on
her
lips
and
went
to
his
office
now
eddie
said
lottie
as
she
took
my
arm
take
this
money
and
spend
it
for
mccay
in
such
a
manner
and
in
such
sums
as
in
your
judgment

best
promote
her
welfare

consider

invited
to
what
hour

are
a
privileged
guest
and
may
come
when
you
please
go
along
now
and
attend
to
mccay
and
i
will
arrange
my
plans
for
the
i
made
my
appearance
at
rockland
s
residence
by
five
and
met
lottie
at
the
front
portico
what
induced
you
to
come
so
early
edward
i
wanted
to
be
with
you
that
is
all
but
how
does
it
happen
that
you
are
dressed
so
exquisitely
this
evening
i
declare
you
have
made
a
complete
success
of
it
you
look
like
an
empress
prepared
to
receive
a
dozen
kings
as
her
guests
i
never
saw
you
looking
so
pretty
as
you
do
now
what
does
it
mean
read
that
note
and
it
will
tell
dear
lottie
prepare
dinner
for
a
dozen
distinguished
guests
two
senators
and
their
wives
are
with
the
governor
and
will
dine
with
us
the
honorable
cyrus
bramlett
a
cousin
to
viola
has
just
arrived
and
will
sojourn
with
us
two
weeks
your
who
is
cyrus
bramlett
i
never
heard
of
him
he
is
a
member
of
congress
from
new
york
and
said
to
be
an
orator
of
wonderful
powers
he
will
object
to
a
marriage
between
harry
and
his
why
so
because
he
will
want
her
i
hope
he
will
leap
into
the
arena
at
once
and
contend
for
the
the
guests
had
all
arrived
by
six
and
a
feeling
of
delight
thrilled
me
when
i
saw
lottie
receiving
her
distinguished
guests
with
so
much
dignity
and
when
dinner
was
announced
the
governor
offered
his
arm
to
lottie
rockland
took
charge
of
one
of
the
senators
wives
while
flipout
escorted
the
other
and
bramlett
gave
his
arm
to
his
fair
cousin
and
as
the
guests
marched
into
the
i
could
see
wallingford
eying
bramlett
in
a
manner
which
plainly
showed
that
he
was
greatly
annoyed
at
the
attentions
bestowed
on
miss
bramlett
by
her
distinguished
cousin
i
imagined
that
i
could
perceive
signs
indicative
of
an
approaching
storm
and
the
thought
gave
rise
to
serious
apprehensions
in
my
mind
the
young
member
of
congress
from
new
york
had
scarcely
taken
his
seat
at
the
table
when
he
commenced
an
animated
conversation
with
lottie
bramlett
said
the
governor
as
he
promenaded
the
veranda
with
that
gentleman
a
few
moments
after
dinner
that
miss
wallingford
is
a
most
extraordinary
girl
she
surpasses
any
one
i
have
ever
met
both
as
respects
beauty
of
person
and
mind
they
say
she
outwitted
all
the
lawyers
on
the
trial
of
your
cousin
s
case
and
set
a
trap
which
caught
two
of
the
state
s
yes
it
is
true
and
my
pretty
cousin
is
much
indebted
to
miss
wallingford
for
her
deliverance
in
that
unfortunate
affair
i
intended
to
be
present
at
the
trial
myself
but
was
prevented
by
severe
illness
i
have
come
to
take
my
fair
cousin
home
with
yes
and
to
make
her
your
wife
i
my
aspirations
have
not
dared
to
soar
quite
so
high
as
that
though
to
win
such
a
rich
gem
would
be
a
triumph
worth
contending
for
but
i
vaguely
suspect
that
the
heart
of
my
fair
cousin
has
already
been
captured
did
you
notice
how
she
appeared
to
drink
inspiration
from
wallingford
s
eyes
across
the
table
no
i
did
not
but
what
of
that
you
must
remember
the
old
threadbare
motto
faint
heart
never
won
fair
go
in
and
since
the
struggle
must
enlarge
thy
motto
be
charge
chester
charge
your
excellency
offers
good
advice
but
i
believe
i
will
lay
siege
to
the
other
ah
bramlett
you
will
lose
your
labor
there
for
demar
has
been
commander
of
that
fair
castle
so
long
that
the
memory
of
man
runneth
not
to
the
yes
but
harry
wallingford
shall
not
marry
my
fair
cousin
unless
he
gives
his
beauteous
sister
to
as
the
dinner
progressed
the
flow
of
wit
increased
until
every
guest
began
to
participate
in
it
politics
and
religion
finance
and
agriculture
science
and
art
music
and
history
were
all
largely
discussed
come
said
harry
as
he
laid
his
hand
on
my
arm
let
us
go
out
on
the
corridor
and
smoke
a
i
took
his
arm
and
we
began
to
pace
up
and
down
the
floor
the
weather
was
quite
warm
and
not
a
breath
of
air
could
be
felt
come
let
us
go
into
the
garden
i
could
not
control
myself
if
i
remained
here
let
us
sit
under
these
vines
on
this
little
bench
i
feel
the
oppressive
heat
more
than
we
had
not
been
there
more
than
twenty
minutes
when
quillet
and
bullger
came
walking
slowly
toward
us
the
night
was
not
a
very
dark
one
though
there
was
no
moon
but
the
stars
appeared
to
shine
unusually
bright
we
were
completely
hidden
by
the
overhanging
vines
and
as
we
preferred
to
be
alone
we
remained
silent
hoping
that
the
two
lawyers
would
pass
on
but
they
went
into
the
which
was
not
more
than
twenty
feet
from
where
we
sat
they
were
conversing
in
very
low
tones
but
we
could
hear
every
word
they
said
i
started
to
rise
from
my
seat
as
i
was
unwilling
to
play
the
part
of
an
eavesdropper
but
harry
caught
my
sleeve
and
pulled
me
back
to
the
seat
and
in
a
whisper
requested
me
to
be
still
and
listen
what
do
you
think
of
miss
bramlett
now
bullger
inquired
quillet
the
more
i
see
of
her
the
better
i
like
her
but
it
is
no
use
for
a
fellow
to
fall
in
love
with
her
for
they
say
she
is
going
to
marry
harry
yes
and
i
must
confess
that
i
am
astonished
to
hear
why
because
he
was
engaged
to
her
before
she
got
into
her
late
trouble
but
as
soon
as
she
was
put
in
jail
he
told
her
to
her
face
that
he
thought
she
was
guilty
she
ordered
him
to
leave
her
presence
and
commanded
him
never
to
speak
to
her
again
he
deserted
her
while
she
was
under
the
cloud
and
left
her
to
paddle
her
own
canoe
but
as
soon
as
it
appeared
that
she
was
innocent
what
does
he
do
but
beg
pardon
and
make
matters
smooth
i
suppose
he
loves
her
money
better
than
he
does
the
girl
i
always
did
despise
a
yes
and
so
does
every
honest
man
but
i
can
not
understand
how
such
a
sensible
girl
could
be
so
ready
to
give
her
hand
to
such
a
pshaw
don
t
you
know
that
where
a
woman
once
loves
a
man
she
never
forsakes
him
no
matter
what
he
does
well
i
suppose
there
is
something
in
that
but
harry
wallingford
is
a
very
brilliant
young
man
and
i
used
to
think
he
was
the
very
soul
of
honor
i
did
not
think
he
would
ever
justly
win
the
name
of
neither
did
i
but
human
nature
is
very
weak
you
know
and
the
prize
in
this
case
is
a
very
tempting
one
because
miss
bramlett
is
very
beautiful
and
possessed
of
an
amiable
disposition
as
well
as
a
great
by
jove
the
bait
is
enough
to
trap
anybody
ah
you
are
right
there
but
lottie
wallingford
is
the
apple
of
my
eye
i
had
rather
have
her
for
my
wife
than
to
be
king
of
yes
no
doubt
you
would
but
there
is
no
likelihood
of
your
ever
being
king
of
england
or
the
husband
of
lottie
wallingford
either
because
she
belongs
to
ed
well
he
is
a
lucky
dog
come
let
us
walk
back
to
the
house
it
is
no
use
to
covet
our
neighbors
property
those
two
girls
are
not
for
while
that
conversation
was
going
on
harry
had
his
hand
on
my
arm
and
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
keep
from
crying
out
for
his
finger
nails
sank
down
into
my
flesh
so
as
to
bring
blood
let
go
my
arm
harry
you
are
hurting
i
ask
pardon
i
did
not
think
what
i
was
doing
does
it
not
surprise
you
to
see
me
sitting
quietly
by
your
side
no
why
should
i
be
surprised
do
you
think
i
would
let
any
man
talk
that
way
about
me
unless
he
was
telling
the
truth
have
i
not
been
guilty
of
every
charge
they
made
against
me
of
course
i
have
but
thank
heaven
it
is
not
too
late
to
make
the
proper
atonement
edward
it
is
all
over
with
viola
and
me
i
do
now
solemnly
swear
by
everything
that
i
hold
sacred
that
i
never
will
marry
her
until
my
fortune
is
equal
to
hers
so
help
me
heaven
harry
i
do
believe
you
are
a
real
yes
that
is
certain
but
there
is
no
use
to
scold
me
about
it
if
viola
will
agree
to
wait
till
my
fortune
is
made
all
right
if
she
refuses
let
her
marry
her
cousin
and
be
done
with
as
to
that
you
need
have
no
fears
whatever
for
she
worships
you
and
if
you
forsake
her
it
will
kill
her
yes
i
mean
exactly
what
i
say
it
will
certainly
kill
in
the
first
place
i
do
not
intend
to
forsake
her
for
i
love
her
as
no
man
ever
loved
a
woman
before
and
if
she
will
wait
for
me
i
will
make
a
fortune
as
sure
as
my
name
is
harry
by
the
by
harry
i
have
a
little
secret
to
tell
what
is
it
pray
you
know
that
viola
bought
a
little
bottle
of
strychnine
and
refused
to
tell
why
she
purchased
it
i
certainly
do
and
her
refusal
to
tell
why
she
bought
it
was
the
strongest
evidence
against
true
enough
well
i
can
tell
you
all
about
it
she
got
it
when
you
were
very
ill
and
everybody
thought
you
were
going
to
die
she
was
preparing
to
commit
suicide
and
if
you
had
died
she
would
not
have
survived
you
an
great
heavens
is
that
so
it
is
for
lottie
pumped
the
secret
out
of
her
now
you
must
be
very
cautious
when
you
inform
her
of
your
intention
to
go
to
if
she
will
only
trust
me
and
agree
to
wait
for
me
i
will
never
forsake
her
but
let
us
walk
back
to
the
house
else
we
will
be
time
glided
on
and
harry
lingered
by
viola
s
side
strolling
about
the
flower
garden
with
her
arm
locked
in
his
and
dreading
to
make
his
intentions
known
to
her
love
was
urging
him
to
marry
the
girl
of
his
choice
and
be
happy
while
pride
was
making
a
desperate
effort
to
separate
him
from
his
love
miss
bramlett
and
lottie
were
seated
on
a
low
wooden
bench
in
the
engaged
in
an
earnest
conversation
harry
wallingford
made
his
appearance
at
the
door
come
in
brother
said
lottie
i
am
glad
you
happened
here
because
i
want
you
to
join
me
in
persuading
viola
to
abandon
the
idea
of
going
with
her
cousin
to
new
if
miss
bramlett
will
not
yield
to
your
solicitations
i
am
sure
she
would
not
to
mine
it
would
be
unjust
to
her
distinguished
relative
to
deprive
him
of
the
company
of
his
fair
cousin
the
fact
is
we
ought
not
to
expect
miss
bramlett
to
remain
among
such
dull
people
as
ours
when
such
brilliant
members
of
congress
claim
her
miss
bramlett
bent
her
eyes
toward
the
ground
while
her
cheeks
were
red
with
anger
but
she
bit
her
lips
to
smother
her
feelings
lottie
turned
pale
and
gazed
at
her
brother
with
a
look
of
astonishment
while
a
painful
sensation
darted
through
her
heart
she
was
convinced
that
her
brother
had
become
jealous
of
cyrus
bramlett
and
she
well
knew
that
it
was
without
cause
take
a
seat
here
brother
said
lottie
and
arrange
that
bouquet
for
me
while
i
go
and
gather
more
this
was
a
ruse
on
lottie
s
part
to
leave
harry
and
viola
alone
as
she
thought
it
the
best
plan
to
insure
a
reconciliation
between
them
miss
bramlett
i
suppose
if
you
go
with
your
distinguished
cousin
you
will
spend
the
winter
in
washington
no
i
shall
remain
in
new
we
shall
be
very
far
apart
when
you
go
to
new
york
and
i
to
san
what
do
you
mean
wallingford
viola
i
am
going
to
start
for
california
in
the
morning
and
it
may
be
a
long
time
before
we
meet
again
i
wish
to
ask
you
a
serious
question
and
i
want
you
to
give
me
a
serious
all
color
now
instantly
fled
from
her
cheeks
and
her
body
trembled
violently
i
am
going
to
seek
my
fortune
in
the
far
west
and
i
wish
to
know
if
you
will
promise
to
be
mine
when
i
return
if
you
go
to
california
it
is
my
opinion
that
we
never
shall
meet
why
do
you
think
that
there
are
many
reasons
i
might
mention
that
cause
me
to
think
it
but
if
you
will
excuse
me
i
had
rather
not
talk
about
such
a
painful
miss
bramlett
have
i
been
mistaken
in
believing
that
you
loved
me
if
we
ever
meet
again
ask
the
question
and
you
shall
have
a
candid
would
you
have
me
go
so
far
away
without
knowing
my
fate
i
would
not
have
you
go
at
all
but
it
appears
that
your
resolve
is
made
and
i
suppose
you
know
best
what
you
ought
to
i
know
that
i
am
an
idiot
and
that
i
have
succeeded
in
convincing
you
of
that
interesting
fact
and
that
you
will
rejoice
to
be
rid
of
this
is
not
the
first
time
you
have
unjustly
suspected
me
but
i
hope
it
will
be
the
why
then
did
you
so
suddenly
conclude
to
leave
us
and
that
too
before
you
knew
of
my
intention
to
go
to
california
because
i
have
no
home
here
in
fact
i
have
no
home
anywhere
but
i
have
friends
and
relatives
in
new
york
who
will
give
me
a
yes
indeed
you
have
one
distinguished
kinsman
who
i
dare
say
will
offer
you
a
home
and
a
heart
to
boot
and
i
could
not
blame
you
for
accepting
such
a
brilliant
mr
wallingford
your
language
does
not
afford
me
any
pleasure
and
unless
you
have
something
else
to
talk
about
i
guess
we
had
better
i
crave
your
pardon
i
assure
you
i
did
not
mean
to
annoy
then
in
a
fit
of
anger
he
abruptly
walked
away
harry
started
to
california
next
morning
without
having
any
other
interview
with
miss
bramlett
thus
letting
his
pride
again
master
his
heart
ragland
s
body
was
found
floating
in
the
river
at
the
head
of
president
s
island
without
any
marks
of
violence
on
it
showing
clearly
that
he
had
committed
suicide
poor
man
perhaps
he
deserved
a
better
fate
though
he
had
not
led
the
sort
of
a
life
that
produces
happiness
an
appetite
for
strong
drink
and
a
love
for
the
gambling
table
had
ruined
him
before
the
discovery
of
his
wife
s
infidelity
was
made
mr
rockland
received
a
letter
from
one
of
the
trustees
at
new
york
stating
that
the
death
of
ragland
created
a
necessity
for
miss
bramlett
to
come
there
immediately
within
ten
days
after
harry
had
started
for
california
viola
was
on
her
way
to
new
york
accompanied
by
her
cousin
cyrus
over
a
month
had
elapsed
after
viola
s
departure
when
rockland
received
a
letter
from
a
lawyer
in
new
york
of
a
most
startling
nature
the
perusal
of
which
plunged
us
all
into
the
deepest
gulf
of
distress
here
is
the
letter
let
it
speak
for
itself
nathaniel
rockland
esq
dear
sir
i
know
you
will
be
surprised
and
deeply
pained
to
learn
that
the
trustees
appointed
by
bolivar
bramlett
s
will
have
converted
the
entire
estate
into
cash
and
fled
to
parts
unknown
every
possible
effort
has
been
made
to
capture
them
but
without
success
and
it
is
pretty
well
ascertained
that
they
have
crossed
the
ocean
and
are
safe
in
some
foreign
land
but
my
dear
sir
i
have
not
told
you
the
serious
part
of
the
story
yet
and
you
will
think
so
when
i
do
miss
viola
bramlett
has
mysteriously
disappeared
from
her
boarding
house
and
despite
the
efforts
of
the
police
to
discover
her
whereabouts
the
mystery
remains
unsolved
a
week
ago
she
left
her
boarding
house
on
fifth
avenue
telling
her
friends
that
she
was
going
to
stewart
s
store
on
broadway
nothing
was
thought
about
it
until
night
when
her
friends
began
to
make
inquiries
about
her
she
had
been
to
the
stewart
store
and
made
some
trifling
purchases
but
instead
of
ordering
the
articles
to
be
sent
to
her
boarding
house
as
was
her
usual
custom
she
took
them
with
her
three
experienced
detectives
were
employed
immediately
and
up
to
this
writing
they
have
failed
to
make
any
discoveries
except
that
she
was
seen
standing
on
the
wharf
near
the
water
s
edge
just
before
dark
on
the
day
she
left
her
boarding
house
if
she
was
alive
it
seems
to
me
that
the
detectives
could
not
fail
to
find
her
therefore
i
fear
we
may
expect
the
very
worst
ever
since
her
arrival
in
this
city
she
has
appeared
to
be
very
unhappy
and
was
often
found
weeping
she
avoided
company
rarely
speaking
to
any
one
and
the
only
conclusion
we
can
arrive
at
is
that
the
poor
girl
has
committed
suicide
every
possible
effort
will
be
made
to
find
her
and
if
we
succeed
i
will
immediately
inform
you
by
wire
very
respectfully
albert
i
shall
not
trouble
you
with
a
history
of
our
misery
produced
by
this
awful
news
but
drive
on
to
the
end
of
this
unpleasant
part
of
my
story
in
obedience
to
lottie
s
request
i
set
out
immediately
to
new
york
to
do
all
in
my
power
to
unravel
the
strange
mystery
promising
if
viola
was
found
to
bring
her
home
with
me
i
wrote
a
short
letter
to
harry
inclosing
dalmaxim
s
letter
and
urged
him
to
come
home
without
delay
when
i
arrived
at
new
york
i
learned
that
no
clew
to
the
missing
girl
had
been
discovered
and
that
the
police
and
detectives
had
given
up
the
contest
i
went
to
work
in
earnest
determined
to
exhaust
every
plan
i
could
think
of
to
find
viola
but
at
the
end
of
ten
days
hope
died
in
my
breast
and
i
was
compelled
to
conclude
that
viola
had
drowned
herself
i
remained
in
new
york
a
month
and
it
was
with
a
sad
heart
i
started
home
when
i
thought
of
the
distressing
news
that
i
would
be
compelled
to
communicate
to
lottie
i
had
not
been
back
home
but
a
short
time
when
harry
returned
from
california
looking
more
like
a
ghost
than
a
man
is
she
found
he
gasped
as
he
staggered
into
my
office
and
dropped
into
a
chair
no
but
we
still
have
hopes
you
are
ill
harry
let
me
go
home
with
you
lottie
is
looking
for
no
i
will
not
go
home
i
can
not
bear
to
look
into
dear
lottie
s
face
now
i
am
going
immediately
on
to
new
york
to
spend
the
remnant
of
my
life
in
searching
for
poor
viola
though
i
have
but
little
hope
of
ever
seeing
her

about
your
uncle

will

t
let
us
talk
about
that
now
money
has
been
my
ruin
i
am
a
rich
man
now
but
it
comes
too
late
fortune
still
continues
to
hurl
her
deadly
missiles
with
unerring
aim
at
me
everything
goes
wrong
with
me
my
uncle
did
make
another
will
and
placed
it
in
the
hands
of
a
trusted
friend
who
happened
to
be
traveling
in
europe
when
my
uncle
died
if
that
friend
had
been
at
home
all
would
have
been
well
but
my
luck
would
not
have
it
so
the
man
with
whom
the
will
had
been
left
fell
ill
and
died
in
scotland
and
when
his
administrator
took
charge
of
his
effects
in
san
francisco
my
uncle
s
will
came
to
the
surface
giving
his
property
to
lottie
and
myself
curse
the
will
curse
the
money
curses
on
my
luck
a
double
curse
on
my
foolish
pride
why
did
i
not
take
viola
with
me
as
my
wife
because
i
never
was
known
to
do
anything
that
ought
to
be
done
viola
told
me
that
if
i
went
to
california
we
never
would
meet
again
i
did
not
understand
her
meaning
then
but
it
is
plain
to
me
now
she
was
contemplating
suicide
then
and
she
has
since
carried
out
her
intention
here
eddie
take
this
envelope
and
when
you
know
i
am
dead
you
may
open
it
don
t
stare
at
me
that
way
please
it
is
nothing
but
my
will
giving
all
my
property
to
lottie
she
has
the
good
sense
to
make
the
proper
use
of
it
give
my
love
to
my
darling
sister
and
tell
her
when
i
find
viola
she
shall

my
darling
sister

let
her
grieve
about
her
unfortunate
brother

will
make
you
happy
as
you

would
give

happy
disposition

be
so
old
fellow

may
meet
again
but
never
until
i
find
before
i
could
muster
courage
to
answer
he
was
gone
chapter
xxxix
nearly
a
year
has
elapsed
since
i
last
parted
with
harry
wallingford
under
very
peculiar
circumstances
it
was
at
the
cemetery
in
the
city
of
new
york
where
i
took
my
painful
leave
of
him
and
i
never
have
seen
him
since
though
we
have
received
several
letters
from
him
i
believe
it
was
on
the
next
monday
after
wallingford
set
out
on
his
journey
to
new
york
that
rockland
received
a
letter
from
dalmaxim
which
furnished
a
solution
of
the
mystery
connected
with
miss
bramlett
s
sad
fate
in
order
to
enlighten
my
audience
as
much
as
possible
in
connection
with
that
distressing
affair
i
will
read
you
the
letter
nathaniel
rockland
dear
sir
it
is
with
feelings
of
the
deepest
sorrow
that
i
perform
the
sad
duty
of
conveying
to
you
the
news
of
miss
bramlett
s
death
the
body
of
that
unfortunate
young
lady
was
discovered
on
yesterday
floating
in
east
river
where
it
had
evidently
remained
a
considerable
length
of
time
for
it
was
in
an
advanced
stage
of
decomposition
the
features
were
very
much
disfigured
probably
occasioned
by
being
eaten
by
the
fish
but
her
friends
here
readily
recognized
the
drab
silk
dress
as
the
one
worn
by
miss
bramlett
on
the
day
of
her
disappearance
a
large
gold
ring
with
a
diamond
set
was
found
on
one
of
her
fingers
which
was
also
identified
by
her
friends
as
the
property
of
miss
bramlett
on
the
inside
of
the
ring
the
letters
from
harry
to
viola
appeared
plainly
engraved
which
settles
the
question
of
identity
beyond
the
possibility
of
a
doubt
the
body
was
found
under
the
wharf
where
it
had
been
held
by
a
large
iron
spike
that
projected
from
one
of
the
piles
which
had
caught
in
the
skirt
of
the
silk
dress
thus
preventing
the
corpse
from
floating
out
a
white
handkerchief
of
very
costly
fabric
bordered
with
lace
was
found
in
the
pocket
of
her
dress
which
was
found
to
be
marked
in
one
corner
with
the
letters
v
plainly
wrought
with
green
silk
thread
the
handkerchief
was
also
identified
as
the
property
of
miss
bramlett
that
the
poor
girl
committed
suicide
there
seems
to
be
no
room
for
doubt
as
upon
critical
examination
made
by
experienced
surgeons
no
marks
of
violence
could
be
discovered
a
large
number
of
witnesses
were
examined
before
the
jury
of
inquest
including
many
friends
and
relatives
of
miss
bramlett
all
of
them
recognized
the
dress
ring
and
handkerchief
as
her
property
notwithstanding
the
vigorous
efforts
made
by
miss
bramlett
s
friends
to
ascertain
the
cause
that
induced
her
to
destroy
herself
nothing
definite
has
been
developed
though
i
hear
it
suggested
that
it
was
a
disappointment
in
a
love
affair
with
wallingford
i
am
thoroughly
convinced
that
it
was
not
the
loss
of
her
fortune
that
caused
it
for
all
concur
in
the
idea
that
she
despised
money
and
was
often
heard
to
say
that
she
regretted
being
a
rich
heiress
with
many
wishes
for
your
health
and
success
i
am
sir
yours
very
respectfully
albert
dalmaxim
before
harry
wallingford
arrived
at
new
york
the
remains
of
the
drowned
girl
had
been
deposited
in
the
grave
i
was
induced
by
lottie
to
make
a
second
trip
to
new
york
to
bring
harry
home
upon
my
arrival
at
the
city
i
was
not
a
little
surprised
to
learn
that
wallingford
had
caused
a
costly
monument
to
be
erected
at
the
head
of
the
grave
with
a
suitable
inscription
made
in
plain
italian
letters
when
i
inquired
for
harry
at
his
hotel
i
was
told
by
the
clerk
that
i
would
probably
find
him
at
the
cemetery
as
he
had
been
in
the
habit
of
making
diurnal
visits
there
i
encountered
many
difficulties
in
threading
my
way
through
the
city
of
the
dead
but
after
making
several
mistakes
and
traveling
many
hundreds
of
yards
unnecessarily
i
at
length
succeeded
in
finding
the
spot
i
sought
harry
was
busily
engaged
with
a
florist
in
arranging
some
pinks
and
geraniums
at
the
foot
of
the
grave
and
consequently
did
not
observe
me
until
i
had
stood
leaning
against
the
palings
gazing
at
him
for
several
minutes
when
he
looked
up
and
saw
me
he
dropped
the
trowel
with
which
he
had
been
transplanting
the
flowers
and
walked
briskly
toward
me
saying
as
he
held
out
his
hand
ah
edward
i
have
killed
her
at
last
here
lies
my
poor
victim
driven
into
the
grave
by
an
unworthy
wretch
who
is
himself
unfit
to
live
and
not
prepared
to
die
you
told
me
i
would
kill
her
and
alas
how
true
it
has
come
to
i
am
sent
by
lottie
to
bring
you
home
i
at
length
managed
to
say
your
sister
is
almost
driven
to
despair
by
this
distressing
occurrence
and
it
is
your
duty
to
go
to
her
as
speedily
as
no
edward
it
would
only
serve
to
increase
my
darling
sister
s
sorrow
for
me
to
be
with
her
tell
my
beloved
sister
that
it
is
my
wish
to
remain
in
new
york
where
i
can
water
the
grave
of
my
victim
with
my
tears
and
commune
with
her
gentle
now
my
good
friends
here
i
am
at
the
end
of
my
awkward
story
and
if
i
have
bored
you
with
the
telling
of
it
i
am
truly
sorry
for
it
but
if
i
knew
i
had
been
so
fortunate
as
to
interest
you
i
should
be
very
much
gratified
to
all
of
my
good
friends
who
have
been
so
kind
as
to
honor
me
with
their
attention
i
beg
permission
to
express
my
grateful
thanks
and
by
way
of
winding
up
the
entertainment
i
suggest
the
idea
that
we
now
adjourn
to
the
saloon
and
engage
in
a
wait
a
moment
sir
if
you
please
said
ivanhoe
as
he
threw
himself
in
front
of
ingomar
as
if
he
was
determined
to
force
him
to
halt
you
have
not
yet
finished
your
story
and
we
do
not
intend
to
permit
you
to
retire
until
you
have
told
us
what
has
become
of
lottie
yes
yes
yes
exclaimed
a
dozen
voices
at
once
let
us
know
what
has
become
of
lottie
my
friends
replied
ingomar
i
pledge
you
my
word
that
there
is
no
such
person
as
lottie
wallingford
now
living
so
far
as
i
know
or
believe
but
if
her
majesty
will
remove
her
mask
i
will
be
very
glad
to
introduce
to
you
lottie
demar
my
beloved
wife
of
whom
i
am
exceedingly
by
the
time
ingomar
concluded
the
sentence
the
mask
was
removed
and
lottie
stood
radiant
beautiful
and
blushing
before
the
admiring
multitude
for
a
moment
the
spectators
gazed
in
breathless
wonder
at
the
angelic
loveliness
of
the
beautiful
creature
who
stood
before
them
then
the
audience
began
to
press
around
the
charming
object
eager
to
offer
their
congratulations
captain
quitman
in
whose
eyes
tears
of
joy
trembled
leaped
on
a
box
and
brandishing
his
cane
in
the
air
called
out
three
cheers
for
the
barbarian
chief
and
his
beautiful
parthenia
then
rose
such
a
joyous
shout
as
to
drown
the
great
noise
caused
by
the
machinery
of
the
boat
a
proposition
was
made
by
ingomar
and
indorsed
unanimously
by
the
crowd
that
all
disguises
should
instantly
be
laid
aside
when
don
quixote
removed
his
mask
lottie
sprang
forward
and
seizing
both
of
his
hands
exclaimed
oh
bless
us
it
is
doctor
plaxico
and
i
am
so
much
delighted
to
meet
my
valued
friend
and
here
is
captain
burk
too
i
am
really
ashamed
to
acknowledge
that
i
did
not
recognize
either
of
when
scottie
removed
her
mask
captain
burk
threw
up
his
hands
with
surprise
as
he
moved
rapidly
to
her
side
while
his
handsome
features
lighted
up
with
a
delightful
smile
miss
darlington
he
ejaculated
two
years
ago
i
considered
you
very
pretty
but
now
i
am
ready
to
swear
on
the
bible
and
the
koran
that
you
are
the
most
beautiful
girl
on
the
globe
captain
burk
replied
miss
darlington
as
she
smiled
sweetly
on
him
i
beg
to
remind
you
that
notwithstanding
all
women
are
fond
of
flattery
they
do
not
like
to
be
praised
in
all
of
the
maskers
promptly
complied
with
the
agreement
by
immediately
dispensing
with
their
disguises
except
napoleon
navarre
and
the
lady
in
the
black
domino
all
three
of
whom
abruptly
retired
from
the
deck
as
soon
as
the
proposition
was
made
ingomar
conducted
lottie
down
to
the
saloon
where
they
were
immediately
followed
by
all
the
passengers
ladies
and
gentlemen
said
the
captain
i
have
a
communication
to
make
to
you
which
i
am
happy
to
believe
will
be
heartily
indorsed
by
my
young
friends
we
are
now
approaching
a
landing
where
we
expect
to
take
on
a
large
lot
of
cotton
bales
which
will
detain
us
at
least
six
hours
and
i
have
ordered
the
steward
to
prepare
a
picnic
dinner
to
be
served
on
shore
where
you
will
find
charming
scenery
cool
shade
and
green
turf
i
have
also
ordered
the
band
to
be
ready
to
make
music
for
those
who
may
wish
to
enjoy
a
rustic
the
spot
selected
for
the
picnic
was
about
two
hundred
yards
from
the
where
the
soft
velvet
turf
was
shaded
by
the
thick
green
leaves
of
innumerable
tall
whose
branches
were
covered
with
verdant
vines
the
band
struck
up
a
lively
waltz
and
then
a
dozen
couples
went
skipping
over
the
greensward
after
the
amusements
had
been
progressing
about
an
hour
a
colored
woman
appeared
on
the
grounds
with
a
large
hamper
basket
of
flowers
which
she
offered
for
sale
among
the
flowers
there
was
a
magnificent
bouquet
containing
every
variety
known
to
the
south
which
demar
immediately
purchased
and
presented
to
lottie
the
young
people
began
to
crowd
around
lottie
eager
to
behold
the
beautiful
present
and
each
one
of
course
was
permitted
to
examine
it
napoleon
although
still
wearing
his
mask
and
refusing
to
participate
in
any
of
the
amusements
condescended
to
handle
and
admire
the
beautiful
bouquet
it
was
noticed
that
he
retained
it
for
a
long
time
apparently
interested
in
the
delicate
workmanship
and
ingenuity
of
its
construction
occasionally
pulling
the
flowers
apart
as
if
he
wanted
to
see
how
it
was
held
together
after
he
had
inspected
it
for
five
minutes
he
handed
it
back
to
lottie
who
immediately
held
it
close
to
her
face
and
began
to
inhale
the
rich
perfume
afforded
by
the
rare
flowers
oh
edward
she
exclaimed
as
she
let
the
bouquet
fall
to
the
ground
the
scent
of
those
flowers
has
made
me
sick
and
i
must
request
you
to
take
me
aboard
the
boat
as
soon
as
you
darling
are
you
very
ill
your
cheeks
have
suddenly
turned
deadly
pale
what
is
the
matter
i
do
not
know
edward
i
never
experienced
such
a
strange
feeling
before
my
throat
and
lungs
feel
as
if
they
were
full
of
burning
fire
and
my
head
is
as
light
as
air
you
will
have
to
carry
me
to
my
room
immediately
for
i
do
not
believe
i
could
walk
a
step
mrs
demar
said
doctor
plaxico
as
he
held
his
fingers
on
her
pulse
have
you
ever
been
subject
to
any
sudden
attacks
of
illness
before
i
have
never
been
ill
at
all
but
one
time
during
the
last
ten
if
you
feel
able
to
talk
i
would
be
glad
if
you
would
give
me
a
minute
description
of
the
first
symptoms
of
the
i
was
in
perfect
health
when
we
went
on
shore
never
felt
better
in
my
life
edward
purchased
a
large
handsome
bouquet
and
gave
it
to
me
and
i
buried
my
face
among
the
fragrant
flowers
inhaling
the
sweet
odor
until
i
was
seized
with
a
sudden
faintness
and
would
have
fallen
to
the
ground
but
edward
caught
me
in
time
to
prevent
it
then
my
throat
and
lungs
began
to
burn
with
an
intolerable
heat
and
have
been
growing
worse
every
moment
oh
edward
can
you
not
give
me
something
to
quench
this
blazing
fire
in
my
lungs
you
know
i
am
not
childish
or
in
the
habit
of
complaining
at
trifles
but
i
can
not
endure
this
intolerable
suffering
plaxico
for
heaven
s
sake
give
her
something
to
stop
her
sufferings
exclaimed
demar
as
he
knelt
down
by
the
bedside
wringing
his
hands
in
despair
plaxico
made
no
reply
to
demar
s
request
in
fact
he
seemed
to
be
perplexed
and
full
of
hesitation
which
was
an
unusual
thing
with
him
for
he
generally
acted
promptly
and
with
energy
doctor
plaxico
said
demar
do
you
know
what
is
the
matter
with
my
wife
have
you
no
means
by
which
you
can
ascertain
the
nature
of
her
disease
have
you
no
suspicions
as
to
the
cause
of
her
sudden
illness
tell
me
then
what
you
i
shall
not
do
it
without
further
oh
edward
exclaimed
lottie
as
she
tore
the
lace
collar
from
her
neck
do
pray
give
me
something
to
cool
my
throat
i
can
not
endure
this
horrible
torture
much
longer
she
tore
away
the
fastenings
that
confined
the
dress
about
her
throat
and
began
to
tear
the
skin
with
her
finger
nails
until
the
blood
commenced
to
gush
out
plaxico
exclaimed
demar
indignantly
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
your
conduct
on
this
awful
occasion
is
to
me
inexplicable
and
i
might
say
inexcusable
are
you
going
to
sit
here
with
folded
hands
and
see
my
darling
die
without
making
an
effort
to
save
her
by
heaven
i
would
gladly
give
my
life
to
save
her
why
not
give
her
an
opiate
because
i
am
what
do
you
mean
exactly
what
i
doctor
plaxico
for
heaven
s
sake
have
pity
on
me
and
quit
speaking
in
riddles
i
am
not
dealing
in
riddles
i
do
not
know
what
is
the
matter
with
your
can
you
not
suggest
some
harmless
drug
that
would
afford
temporary
relief
demar
why
do
you
stare
at
me
that
way
i
am
full
of
astonishment
to
witness
such
a
lack
of
in
one
possessing
such
unlimited
knowledge
of
medical
science
as
i
know
you
it
did
not
require
the
eye
of
science
to
see
that
death
would
soon
step
in
to
relieve
the
sufferer
unless
she
could
be
speedily
relieved
by
other
means
this
fact
was
now
patent
to
edward
demar
who
was
so
completely
crazed
with
grief
that
he
sank
down
by
lottie
and
gave
way
to
despair
oh
edward
cried
lottie
as
she
threw
out
both
arms
as
if
she
were
feeling
for
him
where
are
you
i
do
believe
i
am
going
blind
for
i
can
not
see
lottie
was
then
seized
with
a
frightful
spasm
that
lasted
five
or
six
minutes
which
when
it
passed
off
left
her
in
a
state
of
exhaustion
her
hands
and
feet
became
icy
cold
while
her
throat
and
lungs
were
burning
up
with
unnatural
heat
captain
quitman
who
had
just
heard
of
lottie
s
dangerous
illness
came
hurriedly
into
the
room
to
make
inquiries
how
is
she
bad
enough
she
will
die
inside
of
two
hours
unless
a
radical
change
sets
in
very
great
providence
forbid
exclaimed
the
man
what
is
the
matter
with
her
don
t
have
you
never
seen
any
one
afflicted
as
she
is
why
not
try
the
same
remedies
now
that
you
did
then
because
that
other
patient
what
was
the
matter
with
the
patient
whose
symptoms
resembled
these
the
old
captain
leaped
over
two
chairs
dashing
them
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
and
seizing
plaxico
by
both
shoulders
fairly
lifted
him
off
of
the
floor
letting
him
down
with
a
slam
then
in
a
thundering
tone
exclaimed
plaxico
by
the
great
jupiter
tell
me
what
you
mean
i
mean
what
i
see
here
doctor
do
you
intend
to
insinuate
that
one
of
my
passengers
has
been
poisoned
no
i
insinuate
nothing
for
i
know
the
old
captain
then
rushed
out
of
the
room
and
hurried
toward
the
cook
house
to
have
an
interview
with
the
steward
knocking
over
a
dozen
chairs
as
he
went
and
jostling
a
group
of
ladies
who
attempted
to
intercept
him
with
a
view
of
inquiring
about
lottie
dying
i
believe
he
muttered
as
he
elbowed
his
way
among
the
anxious
crowd
lottie
s
mind
began
to
wander
and
she
would
converse
about
occurrences
that
had
transpired
in
the
days
of
her
childhood
she
suddenly
regained
her
reason
and
began
to
call
for
her
husband
here
i
am
darling
what
can
i
do
to
relieve
you
nothing
edward
oh
i
do
not
want
to
die
now
because
i
have
so
much
to
live
for
i
am
not
afraid
to
die
but
i
was
so
happy
with
my
darling
that
i
wanted
to
remain
with
him
but
if
it
is
god
s
will
that
i
shall
be
taken
away
from
him
i
must
not
the
lady
in
the
black
domino
now
came
dashing
into
the
room
and
fell
on
her
knees
by
the
bedside
and
burst
into
a
violent
fit
of
weeping
her
conduct
was
so
violent
and
mysterious
that
it
filled
the
minds
of
all
with
wonder
and
caused
doctor
plaxico
to
whisper
a
request
to
demar
to
have
her
removed
captain
burk
now
made
his
appearance
at
the
door
and
requested
an
interview
with
plaxico
the
doctor
passed
through
the
door
and
taking
the
captain
s
arm
went
with
him
out
on
the
guards
doctor
plaxico
said
burk
do
you
know
what
is
the
matter
with
demar
have
you
no
suspicions
have
you
any
objections
to
telling
me
what
you
suspect
why
because
it
would
do
no
good
and
might
do
much
would
you
be
surprised
if
i
were
to
guess
exactly
what
you
suspect
indeed
i
i
have
a
suspicion
myself
and
i
propose
that
we
both
write
down
what
we
suspect
and
then
compare
notes
with
the
distinct
understanding
that
this
transaction
is
to
remain
a
profound
secret
between
the
two
men
turned
their
backs
together
and
with
pencils
hurriedly
wrote
something
on
their
memorandum
books
then
facing
each
other
captain
burk
handed
his
book
to
plaxico
poison
exclaimed
plaxico
poison
cried
burk
then
both
men
stared
wildly
at
each
other
what
caused
you
to
suspect
that
she
was
poisoned
inquired
captain
burk
the
peculiar
symptoms
was
the
prompt
reply
what
aroused
your
suspicions
my
poor
newfoundland
dog
has
just
died
from
the
effects
of
poison
or
at
least
such
is
my
what
led
you
to
such
a
conclusion
when
demar
was
so
suddenly
taken
ill
we
were
dancing
on
the
green
turf
but
we
all
immediately
ceased
dancing
and
returned
to
the
boat
before
i
had
reached
the
shore
some
one
of
the
ladies
called
my
attention
to
the
beautiful
bouquet
which
demar
had
dropped
and
requested
me
to
bring
it
aboard
i
was
then
about
thirty
yards
from
the
spot
where
the
bouquet
had
been
dropped
and
pointing
at
it
i
commanded
don
to
fetch
it
to
me
he
started
instantly
running
swiftly
to
the
spot
seized
the
bouquet
in
his
mouth
and
soon
deposited
it
at
my
feet
it
was
but
a
moment
after
he
had
deposited
the
flowers
at
my
feet
when
he
began
to
whine
and
reel
and
in
three
minutes
he
was
merciful
god
captain
burk
some
treacherous
villain
has
intentionally
murdered
that
poor
lady
where
is
the
bouquet
in
my
go
bring
it
here
quick
burk
returned
instantly
with
the
flowers
now
get
me
a
dog
cat
or
any
live
animal
that
you
can
find
so
we
may
make
a
a
deck
hand
was
found
who
had
a
worthless
dog
that
he
had
been
trying
to
hire
some
one
to
kill
the
dog
s
nose
was
forced
deep
into
the
body
of
the
bouquet
and
held
there
three
minutes
and
three
minutes
afterward
he
was
dead
then
such
a
panic
spread
among
the
passengers
as
to
beggar
all
powers
of
description
several
ladies
were
precipitated
into
hysterical
fits
while
brave
men
who
had
often
faced
death
on
the
battle
field
unmoved
by
fear
now
trembled
like
cowards
what
motive
could
any
one
have
for
murdering
the
most
beautiful
the
most
charming
woman
aboard
the
boat
suspicion
soon
began
to
point
her
finger
at
the
lady
in
the
black
domino
while
the
matter
was
discussed
in
low
whispers
by
the
passengers
meantime
lottie
s
condition
was
growing
worse
rapidly
and
the
doctor
declared
that
there
were
no
grounds
for
hope
despair
and
horror
were
visible
on
every
face
while
tears
began
to
stream
from
the
eyes
of
many
strong
men
who
did
not
often
weep
who
is
the
abandoned
wretch
inquired
george
as
he
elbowed
his
way
through
the
crowd
near
the
door
i
handled
that
bouquet
i
buried
my
face
among
the
flowers
and
for
at
least
twenty
seconds
enjoyed
the
fragrance
yet
it
did
not
poison
me
which
proves
beyond
doubt
that
the
fatal
drug
was
placed
in
it
after
i
handled
who
was
the
last
one
to
handle
it
before
it
was
returned
to
lottie
exclaimed
captain
burk
the
lady
in
the
black
domino
replied
scottie
you
are
mistaken
there
i
think
miss
darlington
said
george
for
it
is
my
recollection
that
napoleon
was
the
one
who
returned
the
bouquet
to
lottie
i
remember
distinctly
that
he
held
it
in
his
hand
a
long
while
and
that
he
kept
pulling
the
flowers
apart
as
if
desirous
to
see
how
it
was
held
it
is
a
settled
fact
said
captain
quitman
that
the
one
who
returned
that
bouquet
to
demar
is
the
one
that
deposited
the
poison
on
it
and
if
that
person
can
be
pointed
out
we
may
be
able
to
detect
the
when
the
fact
that
demar
was
poisoned
was
first
announced
by
doctor
plaxico
the
lady
in
the
black
domino
who
had
been
expelled
from
lottie
s
room
a
short
time
before
uttered
a
loud
piercing
scream
and
ran
rapidly
toward
her
own
what
on
earth
does
that
mean
exclaimed
captain
burk
as
the
woman
came
dashing
past
him
i
would
risk
my
life
on
her
being
the
poisoner
said
scottie
she
has
just
now
heard
doctor
plaxico
say
that
lottie
would
be
dead
in
less
than
two
hours
i
was
present
when
the
announcement
was
made
and
as
soon
as
that
woman
heard
it
she
uttered
the
scream
and
dashed
away
it
was
not
a
scream
of
distress
but
it
was
a
shout
of
joy
she
is
the
very
wretch
who
deposited
the
poison
in
that
bouquet
and
it
is
my
opinion
that
she
is
in
love
with
demar
and
that
she
has
murdered
lottie
to
get
her
out
of
the
that
is
the
most
plausible
theory
i
have
heard
mentioned
in
connection
with
this
horrible
affair
said
captain
burk
for
i
can
not
believe
that
such
a
charming
woman
as
demar
could
have
an
enemy
except
such
as
are
made
by
the
doctor
plaxico
now
came
out
of
lottie
s
room
looking
unusually
serious
and
when
a
dozen
anxious
friends
inquired
all
at
once
about
the
condition
of
the
patient
he
shook
his
head
and
in
a
voice
choked
with
deep
emotion
said
dying
and
passed
on
as
the
doctor
passed
out
the
lady
in
the
black
domino
was
seen
running
as
fast
as
she
could
from
her
own
to
lottie
s
room
holding
a
large
phial
of
liquid
in
each
hand
stop
madame
exclaimed
doctor
plaxico
as
he
placed
his
back
against
the
door
of
lottie
s
room
you
must
not
go
in
by
what
authority
do
you
forbid
it
i
am
the
attending
physician
which
confers
the
authority
on
me
to
protect
my
patient
from
i
heard
you
say
just
now
that
you
had
abandoned
all
hopes
of
saving
your
patient
s
i
do
not
deny
then
i
will
save
you
madame
did
you
know
that
suspicion
was
pointing
at
you
as
the
murderess
no
nor
do
i
care
where
suspicion
may
choose
to
point
this
is
no
time
to
discuss
suspicions
when
the
purest
the
best
and
noblest
lady
on
earth
is
in
great
peril
stand
aside
sir
and
let
me
go
in
what
stuff
is
contained
in
those
two
bottles
more
poison
i
dare
that
which
i
hold
in
my
left
hand
sir
is
an
antidote
for
vegetable
poison
and
this
is
a
certain
cure
for
the
most
deadly
mineral
poison
now
let
me
go
in
and
since
you
have
given
your
patient
up
you
can
not
deny
me
a
chance
to
save
demar
this
woman
is
crazy
beyond
all
question
and
if
you
let
her
administer
any
drug
to
your
wife
i
want
you
to
distinctly
understand
that
you
do
it
against
my
advice
or
demar
whose
mind
was
overflowed
with
sorrow
gazed
wildly
at
the
mysterious
woman
before
him
madame
he
groaned
why
do
you
wish
to
murder
such
a
sweet
angel
as
lottie
you
are
all
murderers
who
stand
here
caviling
about
nonsense
while
your
victim
is
dying
i
can
and
will
save
lottie
s
life
if
you
will
only
let
me
do
did
you
place
the
poison
in
the
bouquet
no
but
i
know
who
did
and
if
you
will
let
me
i
will
save
lottie
s
life
and
then
show
you
the
how
am
i
to
know
that
the
drug
you
propose
to
give
my
wife
is
not
poison
give
me
a
spoon
and
see
me
drink
the
same
quantity
that
i
shall
offer
to
your
your
request
is
reasonable
and
i
will
take
the
a
spoon
was
brought
when
the
strange
woman
took
the
phial
and
with
a
steady
hand
measured
out
exactly
ten
drops
of
the
liquid
and
instantly
swallowed
it
then
pouring
out
ten
more
drops
she
said
shall
i
administer
it
to
your
wife
or
will
you
do
it
demar
hesitated
a
moment
while
he
stared
with
a
look
of
perplexity
toward
plaxico
who
was
watching
the
proceedings
with
silent
contempt
demar
said
he
i
want
you
to
remember
that
all
this
nonsense
is
being
enacted
contrary
to
my
advice
and
in
the
face
of
the
fair
warning
i
have
given
and
i
warn
you
said
the
lady
in
the
black
domino
firmly
that
if
you
stand
here
halting
and
caviling
about
trifles
much
longer
demar
will
die
and
you
will
be
to
blame
for
who
are
you
madame
inquired
demar
in
a
hesitating
tone
it
matters
not
who
i
am
let
me
be
judged
by
what
i
shall
do
and
if
i
do
not
save
the
life
of
that
poor
lady
you
may
plunge
me
into
the
river
or
roast
me
in
the
why
did
you
shout
with
joy
a
moment
ago
when
you
heard
doctor
plaxico
say
that
lottie
was
poisoned
and
that
she
would
surely
die
because
when
he
said
she
was
poisoned
i
knew
i
could
save
her
life
this
antidote
was
given
to
me
by
a
learned
german
surgeon
who
had
served
in
the
british
army
for
many
years
in
india
it
was
my
good
fortune
to
nurse
him
in
cincinnati
through
a
long
lingering
spell
of
typhus
fever
and
as
a
reward
for
my
services
he
gave
me
these
two
phials
with
their
enough
exclaimed
demar
eagerly
i
believe
and
will
trust
you
and
may
god
grant
you
success
approach
and
administer
the
medicine
lottie
s
eyes
were
rolling
wildly
while
her
breathing
was
difficult
and
all
evidences
of
reason
had
disappeared
all
who
saw
her
were
convinced
that
she
had
commenced
the
struggle
with
the
dreadful
destroyer
the
lady
in
the
black
domino
lifted
lottie
s
head
from
the
pillow
and
emptied
the
medicine
into
her
mouth
holding
her
still
until
she
saw
the
patient
swallow
it
then
laid
her
down
gently
and
waited
for
the
result
plaxico
stood
by
with
one
hand
on
the
patient
s
pulse
and
his
watch
in
the
other
and
although
he
had
disapproved
of
the
experiment
he
earnestly
prayed
in
silence
that
it
might
be
attended
with
success
fifteen
minutes
after
the
antidote
was
administered
lottie
closed
her
eyes
and
appeared
to
be
asleep
while
the
breathing
grew
less
labored
the
pale
face
of
doctor
plaxico
began
to
brighten
how
is
she
now
demar
whispered
as
he
seized
plaxico
s
arm
better
she
is
saved
thank
heaven
exclaimed
the
lady
in
the
black
domino
as
she
fell
on
her
knees
by
the
bed
and
burst
into
tears
be
still
demar
said
plaxico
and
let
go
my
arm
you
are
hurting
me
a
purse
of
fifteen
hundred
dollars
in
money
was
made
up
among
the
passengers
and
a
committee
appointed
with
instructions
to
present
it
to
the
lady
who
had
saved
lottie
s
life
but
the
astonishment
was
boundless
when
the
committee
reported
the
fact
that
the
lady
in
the
black
domino
had
politely
but
firmly
refused
to
accept
the
money
the
next
morning
lottie
was
able
to
rise
from
her
bed
and
when
she
appeared
in
the
saloon
leaning
on
her
husband
s
arm
the
enthusiasm
was
indescribable
congratulations
were
showered
on
the
lovely
favorite
and
everybody
appeared
to
be
happy
chapter
xl
as
soon
as
breakfast
was
over
the
next
morning
after
lottie
had
been
so
miraculously
cured
captain
quitman
arose
from
the
head
of
the
table
and
began
to
address
his
passengers
as
follows
my
young
friends
when
i
purchased
the
white
rose
of
memphis
and
placed
her
on
this
line
the
height
of
my
ambition
was
to
make
her
the
headquarters
of
it
was
my
aim
to
make
it
to
the
interest
of
travelers
to
patronize
my
boat
and
to
furnish
excursion
parties
with
facilities
for
enjoyment
i
had
always
adhered
to
the
idea
that
it
was
the
duty
of
a
commander
to
protect
his
passengers
against
ruffians
and
thieves
and
i
mean
to
do
so
to
the
utmost
of
my
capacity
it
is
with
emotions
of
the
deepest
regret
that
i
am
compelled
to
inform
my
friends
that
by
some
means
unknown
to
me
shrewd
pickpockets
and
robbers
have
managed
to
get
aboard
of
my
boat
one
of
my
passengers
has
been
robbed
of
a
large
sum
of
money
amounting
i
believe
to
something
near
ten
thousand
dollars
another
has
lost
a
splendid
gold
watch
and
others
have
been
deprived
of
jewels
and
other
valuable
articles
i
therefore
request
every
passenger
to
consent
to
be
searched
and
to
permit
the
to
be
thoroughly
examined
and
in
order
to
prevent
any
attempt
to
conceal
the
stolen
property
i
ask
all
the
passengers
to
fall
into
line
now
let
the
ladies
form
on
my
left
and
the
gentlemen
on
my
the
captain
had
scarcely
concluded
his
request
before
the
two
lines
were
formed
the
ladies
promptly
arranging
themselves
to
the
left
and
the
gentlemen
on
his
right
a
few
of
the
passengers
had
retired
to
their
but
as
soon
as
the
wishes
of
the
captain
were
transmitted
to
them
they
immediately
appeared
and
took
their
places
in
the
line
napoleon
and
navarre
arranged
themselves
side
by
side
at
the
head
of
the
gentlemen
s
line
that
woman
is
the
thief
whispered
one
of
the
passengers
addressing
the
man
on
his
left
that
is
exactly
the
conclusion
that
has
possessed
my
mind
was
the
reply
let
no
one
leave
the
line
without
permission
until
the
search
is
ended
and
i
request
demar
and
miss
darlington
to
take
their
places
in
number
seven
and
let
the
ladies
go
there
one
at
a
time
and
submit
to
a
thorough
the
lady
in
the
black
domino
left
her
place
in
the
line
and
with
a
slow
measured
tread
moved
round
and
paused
in
front
of
captain
quitman
this
movement
being
a
plain
violation
of
the
explicit
instructions
of
the
captain
produced
no
small
amount
of
curiosity
and
led
to
innumerable
exclamations
of
surprise
i
would
most
respectfully
ask
you
sir
to
wait
a
moment
said
she
in
a
voice
which
slightly
trembled
but
had
a
sweet
melancholy
sound
i
have
something
to
communicate
which
i
doubt
not
will
have
a
tendency
to
change
the
programme
which
you
have
been
pleased
to
mention
i
must
ask
you
to
let
me
see
the
gentleman
who
had
the
misfortune
to
lose
his
george
woodburry
a
young
man
who
had
been
personating
george
iii
then
promptly
stepped
out
from
the
line
and
confronted
the
black
domino
are
you
the
gentleman
whose
watch
was
stolen
woodburry
merely
answered
by
a
slight
inclination
of
the
head
without
opening
his
lips
she
then
drew
from
her
pocket
a
large
gold
watch
to
which
was
attached
a
massive
chain
holding
it
out
toward
him
she
said
is
this
your
property
sir
then
addressing
the
captain
again
she
requested
him
to
produce
the
gentleman
whose
money
had
been
stolen
henry
of
navarre
stepped
from
his
place
in
the
line
and
confronted
the
black
domino
i
am
the
one
who
has
been
so
unlucky
as
to
lose
a
large
sum
of
take
a
seat
sir
replied
the
woman
near
that
table
there
and
do
me
the
favor
to
count
the
contents
of
this
carefully
and
when
you
have
finished
inform
me
whose
it
is
and
the
amount
of
money
in
navarre
taking
the
drew
a
chair
to
the
table
and
began
to
count
the
money
poor
woman
observed
captain
burk
she
has
stolen
the
money
and
now
when
she
sees
all
chances
of
escape
destroyed
she
is
going
to
confess
and
beg
for
for
my
part
replied
woodburry
i
am
inclined
to
think
she
is
crazy
i
have
noticed
her
singular
conduct
ever
since
we
left
memphis
and
i
am
unable
to
account
for
her
actions
upon
any
other
nearly
all
the
passengers
felt
a
sentiment
of
compassion
for
the
unfortunate
woman
and
several
suggested
the
propriety
of
requesting
captain
quitman
to
let
her
off
without
exposure
inasmuch
as
she
had
restored
the
stolen
property
i
make
a
motion
said
demar
that
we
jointly
petition
the
captain
not
to
expose
the
poor
unfortunate
the
motion
was
unanimously
adopted
and
demar
selected
as
commissioner
to
lay
the
petition
before
captain
quitman
meantime
navarre
finished
counting
the
money
this
is
my
madame
said
he
as
he
rose
from
the
table
and
i
find
all
my
money
in
it
just
as
it
was
when
it
was
then
handing
captain
quitman
a
little
paper
box
she
said
in
this
box
sir
you
will
find
all
the
other
stolen
articles
which
you
will
oblige
me
by
returning
to
the
the
captain
received
the
articles
and
instantly
delivered
them
to
the
parties
from
whom
they
had
been
filched
then
addressing
the
mysterious
woman
he
said
madame
the
circumstances
just
developed
force
me
to
the
performance
of
a
very
painful
duty
which
i
would
gladly
shun
but
i
must
place
you
under
captain
quitman
said
demar
as
he
advanced
to
the
spot
where
he
stood
i
am
requested
by
a
large
number
of
your
passengers
to
inform
you
that
it
is
their
wish
that
this
unfortunate
woman
should
be
forgiven
and
dismissed
without
exposure
we
must
remember
that
the
most
prominent
trait
in
our
great
saviour
s
character
was
his
boundless
mercy
toward
malefactors
when
he
was
bleeding
on
the
cross
suffering
the
agonies
of
death
for
the
sins
of
fallen
man
he
spoke
the
words
of
pardon
to
the
poor
thief
who
was
dying
by
his
side
now
in
humble
imitation
of
the
merciful
example
set
us
by
our
great
redeemer
let
us
pardon
this
poor
unfortunate
woman
and
bid
her
go
and
sin
no
doctor
demar
said
captain
quitman
nothing
would
gratify
me
more
than
to
comply
with
the
wishes
of
you
and
your
friends
but
the
duty
which
i
was
performing
is
one
not
to
be
avoided
by
me
unless
the
request
shall
be
endorsed
by
the
parties
whose
property
was
we
indorse
the
request
most
willingly
said
navarre
i
most
heartily
join
in
that
request
said
george
woodburry
madame
said
the
captain
you
have
heard
the
noble
expressions
of
compassion
which
have
just
been
made
in
your
behalf
and
i
am
happy
to
be
permitted
to
speak
the
words
of
pardon
to
you
you
will
be
permitted
to
remain
in
mask
and
no
further
effort
will
be
made
to
expose
you
but
you
must
leave
this
boat
when
we
arrive
at
captain
quitman
began
the
strange
woman
for
the
manifestations
of
mercy
and
forgiveness
so
generously
expressed
by
these
kind
ladies
and
gentlemen
i
am
profoundly
grateful
but
i
must
be
pardoned
for
saying
that
while
i
appreciate
the
generosity
that
prompts
the
offer
i
do
not
ask
or
wish
any
mercy
from
these
good
ladies
and
noble
men
when
i
want
mercy
i
will
dispatch
my
supplication
to
a
higher
tribunal
where
the
secrets
of
all
hearts
are
known
and
where
good
and
bad
deeds
are
correctly
recorded
i
am
by
no
means
ignorant
of
the
old
legal
maxim
that
holds
the
possessor
of
stolen
goods
responsible
for
the
theft
until
such
possession
is
explained
by
competent
evidence
i
do
not
deny
the
fact
that
a
case
has
been
made
out
in
this
instance
against
me
nevertheless
i
am
not
the
thief
you
were
correct
indeed
when
you
concluded
that
you
had
a
shrewd
thief
aboard
of
this
boat
i
can
assert
of
my
own
knowledge
that
a
demon
is
among
you
whose
black
soul
is
steeped
in
crime
an
inhuman
monster
who
neither
fears
god
man
nor
satan
earth
gapes
hell
burns
fiends
roar
saints
pray
to
have
him
suddenly
carried
away
cancel
his
bond
of
life
dear
god
i
pray
that
i
may
live
to
say
the
dog
is
i
trust
that
my
good
friends
will
pardon
me
for
using
such
strong
language
i
have
borrowed
it
from
shakespeare
s
richard
it
was
suggested
to
my
mind
by
the
striking
resemblance
between
the
bloody
king
and
this
diabolical
monster
this
lapper
up
of
innocent
blood
this
destroyer
of
confiding
virtue
this
cruel
fiend
whose
hands
are
red
with
blood
whose
soul
is
stained
with
perjury
this
false
bloody
villain
is
named
benjamin
bowles
and
here
he
as
quick
as
thought
she
sprang
forward
before
the
sentence
had
been
half
uttered
and
tearing
away
napoleon
s
mask
there
stood
ben
bowles
pale
but
defiant
as
ever
while
anger
and
hate
blazed
from
his
eyes
half
a
dozen
ladies
fainted
others
fled
to
their
while
the
men
stood
still
perfectly
stupefied
with
astonishment
henry
of
navarre
then
slowly
moved
round
and
confronting
bowles
while
his
arms
were
folded
across
his
breast
mr
bowles
you
and
i
have
met
before
a
duty
which
i
owe
to
society
and
the
laws
of
my
country
compels
me
to
take
a
step
which
will
somewhat
interfere
with
your
pleasure
excursion
the
grand
jury
at
memphis
have
decided
that
you
committed
a
cruel
murder
upon
a
little
boy
named
bramlett
now
you
will
have
to
abandon
your
little
pleasure
trip
and
go
with
me
back
to
memphis
if
they
do
not
hang
you
for
the
murder
of
young
bramlett
you
can
then
stand
your
trial
for
your
cowardly
attempt
to
assassinate
demar
you
know
we
can
take
the
train
at
vicksburg
and
return
to
i
know
you
very
well
harry
wallingford
and
am
always
glad
to
meet
you
you
would
be
glad
to
create
the
impression
that
you
are
a
man
of
courage
but
i
happen
to
know
that
that
you
are
a
coward
i
despise
and
defy
you
and
am
sorry
i
can
not
employ
words
sufficiently
insulting
to
induce
you
to
i
have
too
much
bowles
to
resent
an
insult
offered
by
men
of
your
sort
the
fact
is
i
pity
you
for
the
awful
situation
in
which
you
are
placed
and
so
far
as
i
am
individually
concerned
i
mean
to
place
you
in
the
hands
of
the
law
and
leave
you
to
deal
with
god
and
your
own
indeed
sir
that
is
exceedingly
kind
in
you
but
i
must
be
permitted
to
make
some
disposition
of
you
since
you
have
been
so
mindful
of
my
comfort
you
say
you
are
going
to
place
me
in
the
hands
of
god
the
law
my
conscience
and
the
grand
jury
and
how
many
other
distinguished
individuals
have
you
chosen
to
act
as
my
guardian
i
flatter
myself
that
i
shall
be
able
to
make
a
better
disposition
of
you
than
you
have
promised
to
make
of
me
because
i
have
concluded
to
make
hell
a
present
of
your
cowardly
soul
so
you
will
not
be
annoyed
with
so
many
masters
i
think
i
shall
be
able
to
make
a
better
job
this
time
than
i
did
when
i
clipped
your
left
wing
at
as
bowles
uttered
the
last
sentence
he
snatched
a
large
navy
revolver
from
under
his
coat
and
cocking
it
as
he
brought
it
round
leveled
it
at
wallingford
s
breast
but
the
lady
in
the
black
domino
who
was
standing
near
seized
his
arm
and
instantly
jerked
it
round
a
short
scuffle
ensued
the
loud
report
of
the
pistol
rang
out
through
the
saloon
a
cloud
of
blue
smoke
gushed
up
a
column
of
red
flame
blazed
out
a
loud
scream
escaped
the
mysterious
woman
s
lips
and
she
fell
bleeding
into
navarre
s
arms
as
the
body
of
the
lady
dropped
forward
against
navarre
s
breast
he
saw
a
crimson
stream
gush
out
from
her
left
side
and
trickle
over
his
vest
as
her
head
fell
back
across
his
arm
her
mask
fell
off
and
her
dark
brown
hair
dropped
unconfined
about
his
shoulders
merciful
god
exclaimed
wallingford
it
is
viola
and
the
cruel
villain
has
killed
her
as
soon
as
bowles
fired
the
pistol
he
darted
quickly
through
a
side
door
and
ran
rapidly
toward
the
front
end
of
the
boat
evidently
intending
to
leap
into
the
river
and
effect
his
escape
by
swimming
to
the
shore
when
wallingford
made
the
startling
discovery
that
it
was
miss
bramlett
s
blood
that
spurted
against
his
breast
thoughts
of
revenge
instantly
filled
his
mind
gently
laying
the
bleeding
girl
on
a
sofa
he
dashed
through
the
saloon
reaching
the
head
of
the
stairs
that
led
from
the
middle
to
the
lower
deck
just
as
bowles
arrived
on
the
lower
floor
making
a
tremendous
spring
he
leaped
down
in
season
to
catch
the
fugitive
before
he
had
time
to
leap
overboard
as
soon
as
wallingford
leaped
on
the
lower
deck
he
seized
hold
of
the
sleeve
of
bowles
coat
and
called
the
deck
hands
to
assist
in
arresting
the
murderer
a
stalwart
irishman
hurried
forward
intending
to
render
the
aid
but
bowles
who
still
held
the
pistol
in
his
hand
leveled
it
at
the
man
s
head
and
fired
the
bullet
grazed
the
man
s
temple
knocking
him
down
which
induced
the
other
deck
hands
to
believe
that
their
comrade
was
killed
consequently
they
all
beat
a
precipitate
retreat
leaving
wallingford
to
fight
it
out
alone
bowles
knew
that
his
only
chance
to
effect
his
escape
was
to
disable
his
adversary
and
leap
into
the
river
before
assistance
could
come
from
the
saloon
hence
he
attempted
to
shoot
wallingford
which
he
would
have
succeeded
in
doing
but
his
hand
was
knocked
up
just
as
his
finger
touched
the
trigger
which
caused
the
ball
to
fly
harmless
overhead
the
instant
bowles
succeeded
in
disengaging
himself
from
wallingford
s
grasp
and
just
as
demar
reached
the
floor
the
fugitive
leaped
into
the
river
and
began
to
swim
toward
the
shore
leaving
the
pistol
on
the
floor
wallingford
seized
the
pistol
and
commenced
firing
at
bowles
who
kept
diving
under
the
water
in
order
to
dodge
the
bullets
which
were
whistling
in
close
proximity
to
his
head
the
white
rose
at
that
time
was
running
close
to
the
shore
bowles
was
an
expert
swimmer
and
it
was
very
plain
that
unless
prevented
he
would
easily
effect
his
escape
he
had
reached
a
point
at
least
thirty
yards
from
the
boat
before
wallingford
became
convinced
that
all
of
his
shot
had
missed
his
man
throwing
off
his
coat
and
boots
still
holding
the
pistol
in
his
hand
wallingford
plunged
into
the
water
and
set
out
in
pursuit
of
the
escaping
outlaw
turn
her
head
in
toward
the
shore
haliman
as
quick
as
you
can
cried
captain
quitman
who
stood
on
the
hurricane
deck
don
t
lose
a
moment
that
foolish
boy
will
be
drowned
if
he
attacks
that
huge
villain
in
the
it
is
somewhat
dangerous
captain
to
attempt
to
land
her
there
replied
haliman
we
might
get
her
let
her
get
aground
haliman
i
had
rather
sink
her
than
to
see
that
boy
drowned
by
such
a
monster
as
bowles
go
ahead
on
the
starboard
and
hold
steady
on
the
larboard
point
her
head
toward
that
tall
tree
yonder
and
stick
her
nozzle
in
that
quick
quick
haliman
after
demar
had
done
all
he
could
to
dissuade
the
rash
young
man
from
venturing
to
tackle
such
a
giant
while
in
the
water
and
being
unable
to
recall
him
he
threw
off
his
coat
and
plunged
into
the
river
determined
to
save
the
life
of
his
kinsman
or
perish
with
him
the
passengers
crowded
the
hurricane
deck
and
watched
the
approaching
struggle
with
breathless
anxiety
wallingford
continued
to
gain
on
his
hated
foe
while
thoughts
of
revenge
crowded
all
prudence
or
fear
from
his
breast
he
was
thinking
of
the
blood
that
had
spouted
against
his
breast
from
viola
s
side
haliman
owing
to
the
treachery
of
the
current
was
encountering
some
difficulty
in
bringing
his
boat
round
to
the
shore
and
despite
his
vigorous
efforts
to
drive
her
nozzle
on
the
she
swung
round
and
began
to
drift
further
down
demar
soon
became
convinced
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
overtake
harry
in
time
to
render
any
assistance
consequently
he
began
to
call
to
wallingford
begging
him
to
wait
until
he
could
get
to
him
but
the
imprudent
boy
dashed
forward
without
heeding
the
call
he
might
as
readily
have
checked
a
tornado
with
a
lady
s
fan
as
harry
wallingford
by
reminding
him
of
the
danger
into
which
he
was
rushing
when
bowles
became
convinced
that
he
would
be
overtaken
before
he
could
reach
the
shore
he
slackened
his
efforts
and
merely
exerted
sufficient
motion
to
keep
himself
on
the
surface
being
no
doubt
conscious
of
the
great
advantage
which
his
superior
strength
would
give
him
over
his
adversary
in
a
duel
fought
in
the
water
when
wallingford
had
arrived
within
twenty
feet
of
his
enemy
he
began
to
move
obliquely
to
the
left
so
as
to
come
up
where
he
would
have
the
advantage
of
the
current
bowles
turned
round
and
leisurely
floated
on
the
surface
of
the
water
eying
his
pursuer
as
if
he
were
anxious
to
get
hold
of
him
but
wallingford
began
to
swim
round
the
desperado
when
he
came
up
within
six
feet
of
him
he
made
a
sudden
dash
forward
and
attempted
to
strike
him
on
the
head
with
the
pistol
which
he
still
held
in
his
hand
but
at
that
instant
the
bright
blade
of
a
long
dagger
gleamed
in
the
rays
of
the
setting
sun
as
the
arm
of
the
outlaw
descended
toward
wallingford
s
body
a
suppressed
scream
escaped
the
lips
of
a
dozen
ladies
who
witnessed
the
strange
duel
from
the
hurricane
deck
of
the
white
rose
as
they
saw
the
glittering
steel
being
driven
into
wallingford
s
body
then
commenced
a
struggle
one
using
the
pistol
as
a
club
the
other
striking
rapidly
with
the
dagger
every
now
and
then
both
parties
would
for
a
moment
disappear
under
the
water
then
rise
to
the
surface
grappling
each
other
in
a
deadly
embrace
stains
of
blood
began
to
appear
on
wallingford
s
shirt
and
blood
was
streaming
over
his
face
demar
finding
that
his
efforts
to
render
aid
by
swimming
were
fruitless
turned
his
course
and
went
toward
the
yawl
leaping
into
it
he
urged
the
four
men
to
pull
for
dear
life
promising
a
handsome
reward
to
the
oarsmen
if
they
could
get
to
the
combatants
in
time
to
save
wallingford
s
life
after
the
combat
had
been
continued
for
two
or
three
minutes
the
parties
separated
for
a
moment
as
if
by
mutual
consent
in
order
to
get
a
little
breath
and
to
maneuver
for
advantage
only
a
few
seconds
elapsed
however
before
bowles
began
to
advance
toward
his
antagonist
being
anxious
no
doubt
to
end
the
combat
before
the
yawl
could
come
to
wallingford
s
assistance
which
was
now
not
very
far
away
the
two
men
now
began
to
swim
round
each
other
each
seeking
to
get
the
benefit
of
the
current
a
scuffle
then
ensued
but
here
wallingford
s
activity
stood
him
in
good
stead
for
he
managed
to
give
a
sudden
twist
disappearing
under
the
water
while
bowles
swam
round
watching
the
spot
where
harry
had
gone
under
but
no
little
amount
of
astonishment
was
that
which
bowles
felt
when
he
saw
his
wily
foe
rise
up
at
least
twenty
feet
away
wallingford
was
up
the
stream
which
circumstance
would
enable
him
to
make
a
successful
plunge
as
he
would
be
coming
with
instead
of
against
the
strong
current
the
pilot
had
by
this
time
succeeded
in
driving
the
nozzle
of
his
boat
against
the
bank
but
in
consequence
of
the
treachery
of
the
current
he
had
been
compelled
to
strike
the
shore
nearly
a
hundred
yards
below
the
point
first
designated
by
the
commander
the
spectators
were
horrified
to
see
that
wallingford
s
face
was
covered
with
blood
and
when
he
raised
his
body
above
the
water
they
could
see
the
blood
spouting
from
a
dozen
wounds
on
his
neck
face
and
shoulders
for
several
seconds
he
paused
as
if
endeavoring
to
take
a
little
breath
then
giving
his
head
a
sudden
shake
as
if
to
dash
the
bloody
hair
back
from
his
face
he
raised
his
body
high
up
out
of
the
water
and
quick
as
lightning
darted
on
his
adversary
dealing
him
a
tremendous
blow
on
the
back
of
the
head
with
the
butt
end
of
the
pistol
the
sharp
point
of
the
hammer
went
crashing
like
a
bullet
through
the
villain
s
skull
and
the
body
of
ben
bowles
sank
never
to
rise
again
until
it
and
his
soul
were
separated
the
lifeless
body
of
the
desperate
outlaw
was
found
ten
days
afterward
floating
in
the
water
thirty
miles
from
the
spot
where
it
and
the
soul
parted
wallingford
being
completely
overcome
with
fatigue
and
the
loss
of
blood
was
incapable
of
making
any
further
exertion
he
fell
off
of
the
piece
of
timber
and
disappeared
under
the
water
but
as
he
came
up
a
few
seconds
afterward
demar
seized
him
by
the
wrist
as
he
was
sinking
the
second
time
and
lifted
him
into
the
yawl
when
he
fell
insensible
on
the
floor
the
lifeless
body
of
the
rash
young
man
was
hurriedly
conveyed
to
a
on
the
white
rose
where
doctor
plaxico
was
instantly
summoned
to
take
charge
of
the
case
there
is
where
the
danger
lies
said
plaxico
the
dagger
that
inflicted
that
wound
penetrated
the
cavity
of
the
lungs
and
internal
hemorrhage
has
lottie
who
had
at
all
times
been
famous
for
her
courage
and
under
adverse
circumstances
was
now
completely
mastered
by
her
grief
as
soon
as
she
recovered
her
she
implored
the
doctor
to
tell
her
the
very
worst
you
need
not
be
afraid
to
tell
me
the
truth
doctor
tell
me
candidly
is
my
brother
mortally
wounded
or
not
mrs
demar
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
give
anything
like
a
reliable
opinion
just
now
but
to
be
frank
with
you
i
fear
we
may
expect
a
fatal
then
addressing
demar
he
said
go
to
miss
bramlett
without
delay
and
examine
her
wound
and
see
if
anything
can
be
done
for
what
a
pity
it
is
that
such
a
pretty
girl
should
be
murdered
by
such
a
fiend
as
ben
bowles
observed
george
woodburry
in
a
whisper
to
captain
burk
yes
replied
the
captain
she
has
lost
her
life
in
the
attempt
to
save
were
they
not
engaged
to
be
married
yes
though
it
was
thought
by
miss
bramlett
s
friends
that
she
had
committed
suicide
in
new
york
nearly
a
year
ago
there
appears
to
be
some
strange
mystery
connected
with
this
i
wonder
if
she
knew
that
navarre
was
harry
wallingford
in
disguise
i
am
inclined
to
think
she
did
but
i
am
of
the
opinion
that
he
did
not
know
that
the
lady
of
the
black
domino
was
miss
what
a
strange
and
fatal
coincidence
it
is
that
they
should
have
met
here
to
die
at
the
same
time
and
place
both
murdered
by
the
same
desperate
villain
indeed
it
is
is
miss
bramlett
dead
inquired
captain
quitman
who
was
watching
attentively
near
the
door
no
replied
demar
and
i
am
exceedingly
glad
to
be
able
to
inform
you
that
she
is
not
going
to
die
from
any
cause
now
existing
her
wound
is
not
at
all
of
a
serious
character
though
she
has
received
a
very
severe
shock
she
has
entirely
recovered
from
its
effect
and
is
now
soundly
sleeping
under
the
influence
of
an
opiate
and
i
think
it
is
safe
to
predict
that
she
will
be
as
well
as
ever
in
less
than
a
week
the
ball
struck
a
rib
glancing
round
and
making
its
exit
just
to
the
left
of
the
spine
inflicting
merely
a
slight
flesh
heaven
bless
you
demar
for
this
good
news
exclaimed
captain
quitman
as
he
seized
the
surgeon
s
hand
go
in
and
see
wallingford
immediately
and
i
pray
to
god
to
enable
you
to
bring
us
such
good
news
from
him
as
soon
as
demar
went
into
the
room
he
inquired
of
plaxico
the
condition
of
the
patient
bad
enough
heaven
knows
was
the
answer
he
is
totally
unconscious
fever
rising
respiration
difficult
left
lung
gorged
with
blood
and
every
symptom
most
unfavorable
that
stab
under
the
is
the
dangerous
one
demar
you
must
get
some
reliable
nurse
to
remain
with
miss
bramlett
all
the
time
and
let
it
be
distinctly
understood
that
she
is
to
be
closely
watched
if
your
wife
would
undertake
the
task
i
should
be
very
what
do
you
mean
plaxico
have
i
not
just
told
you
that
miss
bramlett
is
scarcely
hurt
at
all
she
will
be
able
to
get
up
by
morning
where
is
the
necessity
of
such
vigilant
that
poor
girl
will
commit
suicide
if
wallingford
dies
i
think
the
chances
are
about
a
thousand
in
favor
of
a
fatal
result
to
one
of
recovery
you
must
not
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
miss
bramlett
did
on
a
former
occasion
contemplate
suicide
when
she
thought
wallingford
was
hopelessly
ill
and
you
may
be
assured
she
will
again
make
the
attempt
if
he
dies
which
i
honestly
believe
he
will
do
inside
of
forty
hours
it
would
be
advisable
to
keep
her
in
ignorance
of
his
condition
until
we
know
exactly
what
is
to
be
the
result
and
i
shall
depend
on
you
and
your
wife
to
do
i
think
you
will
find
that
rather
a
difficult
task
for
the
very
first
word
she
uttered
after
she
recovered
from
the
swoon
was
an
inquiry
about
wallingford
and
she
will
be
sure
to
ask
about
him
as
soon
as
she
we
must
resort
to
strategy
and
a
little
deception
under
the
circumstances
would
be
perfectly
justifiable
you
may
tell
her
that
i
say
wallingford
is
not
dangerously
hurt
and
if
the
recording
angel
has
no
worse
crimes
set
down
against
me
in
the
great
day
of
judgment
i
shall
not
fear
the
demar
and
lottie
watched
by
miss
bramlett
s
bedside
during
the
night
while
plaxico
at
his
own
earnest
request
was
left
alone
with
harry
where
he
sat
during
the
whole
night
watching
with
an
anxious
eye
every
movement
of
his
patient
chapter
xli
soon
after
breakfast
miss
bramlett
announced
her
determination
to
see
wallingford
and
no
amount
of
remonstrance
which
doctor
plaxico
and
demar
could
bring
to
bear
against
the
step
could
prevent
it
lottie
help
me
down
on
my
knees
and
i
will
pray
for
strength
and
courage
to
sustain
me
under
this
trying
lottie
gladly
rendered
the
assistance
requested
and
both
girls
knelt
and
prayed
in
silence
for
a
long
time
and
when
they
rose
up
an
expression
of
calmness
was
visible
on
the
pale
beautiful
face
of
miss
bramlett
lottie
dear
you
can
trust
me
now
and
i
fear
you
will
think
me
superstitious
when
i
tell
you
that
our
prayers
have
been
answered
he
will
not
die
and
we
shall
all
be
happy
again
you
may
let
me
see
him
now
without
any
fears
as
to
my
actions
if
you
will
let
me
lean
on
your
shoulder
i
can
walk
very
the
door
of
wallingford
s
room
was
thrown
open
and
a
chair
placed
near
his
bed
as
miss
bramlett
was
led
to
it
the
pallor
of
her
cheeks
increased
but
no
other
signs
of
emotion
were
to
be
seen
the
wounded
man
was
muttering
continually
in
a
rambling
way
and
every
now
and
then
thrusting
his
arms
out
as
if
striking
at
an
imaginary
enemy
and
it
was
plain
to
be
seen
that
his
mind
was
still
on
the
combat
he
had
had
with
bowles
he
is
exhausting
his
strength
very
rapidly
said
plaxico
and
i
have
been
as
yet
unable
to
quiet
him
i
believe
if
i
could
keep
him
still
that
the
internal
hemorrhage
would
just
at
that
moment
harry
made
a
sudden
spring
and
would
have
leaped
out
of
the
bed
but
miss
bramlett
caught
and
gently
laid
him
down
and
began
to
rub
his
brow
with
her
hand
when
he
instantly
became
quiet
and
in
three
minutes
was
sound
asleep
did
you
see
that
demar
said
plaxico
in
a
low
whisper
see
what
how
quick
he
became
quiet
when
she
put
her
hand
on
his
brow
yes
i
suppose
it
is
mesmerism
magnetism
or
something
of
the
if
we
were
to
live
a
thousand
years
we
might
learn
something
new
every
day
this
is
a
most
wonderful
occurrence
see
he
is
sleeping
soundly
the
respiration
is
less
labored
and
his
pulse
much
better
now
i
imagine
this
strange
phenomenon
would
furnish
material
for
an
article
in
the
and
i
think
i
shall
undertake
to
write
the
very
instant
miss
bramlett
removed
her
hand
from
the
wounded
man
s
brow
he
awoke
and
began
to
move
restlessly
from
side
to
side
but
she
immediately
replaced
it
and
he
was
again
quiet
well
observed
demar
i
must
say
that
this
is
the
strangest
occurrence
that
i
ever
saw
i
believe
their
souls
are
communing
intelligently
with
each
other
and
that
notwithstanding
wallingford
s
reason
is
dethroned
he
is
in
some
way
made
to
know
that
miss
bramlett
is
near
i
have
often
read
about
two
souls
melting
into
one
replied
plaxico
but
this
is
the
first
occular
demonstration
of
the
process
that
has
ever
been
witnessed
by
me
there
is
more
mystery
in
the
anatomy
of
the
human
body
than
is
generally
believed
to
exist
yes
rejoined
demar
especially
does
that
remark
apply
to
the
human
heart
i
speak
from
experience
to
some
extent
and
i
dare
say
that
the
hearts
of
miss
bramlett
and
wallingford
are
at
this
very
moment
conversing
intelligently
with
each
other
a
sort
of
telegraph
which
love
has
erected
is
now
conducting
sweet
messages
from
one
heart
to
the
wallingford
continued
to
slumber
undisturbed
for
four
hours
except
when
miss
bramlett
would
remove
her
hand
from
his
brow
and
then
he
would
begin
to
show
signs
of
restlessness
which
never
failed
to
disappear
as
soon
as
she
would
replace
it
the
burning
fever
that
had
been
raging
began
to
subside
and
the
hemorrhage
ceased
curiously
while
all
the
symptoms
took
a
favorable
turn
demar
whispered
plaxico
after
he
had
held
his
finger
on
the
patient
s
pulse
for
a
long
while
i
think
miss
bramlett
s
treatment
has
saved
our
friend
s
life
the
fact
is
she
has
performed
a
most
wonderful
it
was
late
in
the
evening
when
wallingford
opened
his
eyes
and
began
to
stare
in
a
bewildered
way
at
the
beautiful
face
that
hovered
near
him
while
evidences
of
restored
reason
unmistakably
appeared
in
his
movements
for
two
or
three
minutes
he
gazed
earnestly
at
miss
bramlett
then
placing
his
hand
on
her
head
he
gently
stroked
her
hair
and
then
ran
his
hand
over
her
face
and
then
took
hold
of
her
arm
yes
he
whispered
it
is
her
and
it
was
all
a
dream
and
such
a
horrible
one
too
i
thought
she
was
dead
and
i
dreamed
that
bowles
had
killed
her
and
then
drowned
me
in
the
river
why
do
you
not
speak
to
me
viola
am
i
mistaken
in
thinking
i
see
you
as
he
uttered
the
last
words
he
placed
his
arm
round
her
neck
and
drew
her
head
down
until
her
cheek
touched
against
his
come
away
demar
said
plaxico
as
he
plucked
him
by
the
sleeve
i
shall
shout
with
joy
if
i
remain
here
another
moment
that
scene
is
enough
to
make
the
angels
weep
with
it
was
on
the
morning
of
the
fourth
day
after
wallingford
received
his
wounds
that
he
made
his
appearance
in
the
saloon
supported
by
miss
bramlett
and
lottie
each
one
with
a
shoulder
under
his
arm
fairly
lifting
him
along
by
main
strength
harry
wallingford
was
lazily
reclining
in
a
large
cushioned
armchair
on
the
listening
to
lottie
who
was
reading
mazeppa
to
him
while
miss
bramlett
sat
near
him
gazing
vacantly
at
the
rolling
waves
that
dashed
up
behind
the
boat
a
long
pause
ensued
when
lottie
laid
the
book
down
and
began
to
fondle
her
brother
s
hair
viola
said
harry
i
want
you
to
tell
me
what
induced
you
to
give
your
friends
in
new
york
the
dodge
leaving
them
to
conclude
that
you
had
committed
suicide
in
fact
i
want
you
to
tell
me
all
about
everything
connected
with
your
history
from
the
time
we
parted
until
the
present
there
is
but
very
little
to
tell
i
assure
you
and
as
i
have
nothing
better
to
do
and
being
anxious
to
amuse
you
i
suppose
i
must
undertake
the
task
but
before
i
begin
you
must
allow
me
to
express
my
thanks
for
the
beautiful
monument
you
caused
to
be
erected
over
my
grave
in
new
york
your
generosity
in
that
instance
indeed
deserves
my
profound
gratitude
and
it
has
convinced
me
that
you
did
really
care
something
for
me
but
let
me
leave
that
subject
for
future
discussion
while
i
proceed
with
my
little
history
when
i
was
by
the
dishonesty
of
the
trustees
who
had
control
of
my
money
reduced
to
a
pauper
i
felt
that
it
was
my
duty
to
seek
some
means
of
earning
an
honest
living
that
there
were
many
friends
and
relatives
of
mine
ready
and
anxious
to
offer
me
a
home
i
very
well
knew
but
i
could
not
for
a
moment
bear
the
idea
of
being
dependent
on
relatives
for
support
above
all
things
i
abhor
anything
like
gilded
bondage
or
idle
dependence
consequently
i
resolved
to
seek
employment
i
knew
very
well
that
this
step
would
be
bitterly
opposed
by
my
aristocratic
relations
especially
if
i
should
dare
to
seek
employment
in
new
york
therefore
i
concluded
to
give
them
the
slip
and
hunt
a
distant
home
disguising
myself
completely
i
went
to
cincinnati
and
had
the
good
fortune
to
secure
a
position
as
governess
in
the
family
of
gaterine
the
old
gentleman
who
is
accompanying
me
on
this
trip
one
evening
i
was
passing
along
one
of
the
principal
streets
of
cincinnati
when
i
was
overwhelmed
with
astonishment
to
meet
benjamin
bowles
he
was
disguised
but
notwithstanding
that
i
recognized
him
and
i
knew
in
an
instant
from
his
manner
that
he
was
aware
of
the
fact
that
i
had
penetrated
his
deception
i
hurried
to
the
chief
of
police
and
imparted
the
information
hoping
to
have
him
arrested
but
he
must
have
immediately
fled
as
the
officers
could
not
find
him
i
hired
a
detective
to
look
for
him
but
after
working
a
month
nothing
was
accomplished
but
when
i
tell
you
to
whom
i
am
indebted
for
the
discovery
of
bowles
i
know
you
will
be
greatly
astonished
do
you
see
that
little
boy
yonder
leaning
over
the
bannisters
very
well
it
is
to
that
little
hero
that
i
owe
the
great
obligation
his
name
is
robert
spratt
son
of
a
widow
woman
residing
in
memphis
you
doubtless
remember
him
though
he
has
changed
very
much
in
his
personal
appearance
since
he
left
memphis
they
used
to
call
him
bob
for
his
spine
was
diseased
causing
an
ugly
hump
to
appear
between
his
shoulders
and
seriously
affecting
his
general
health
and
as
i
think
greatly
retarded
his
growth
you
will
notice
that
he
is
quite
a
child
in
stature
but
i
can
tell
you
he
has
the
heart
brain
and
soul
of
a
man
he
is
a
real
gallant
hero
and
you
could
not
find
another
such
a
good
detective
anywhere
he
is
much
older
though
than
his
little
body
would
indicate
i
prevailed
on
him
to
let
me
send
him
to
an
infirmary
at
cincinnati
where
he
was
effectually
cured
for
which
i
paid
one
thousand
dollars
and
as
good
luck
would
have
it
i
met
my
little
protege
on
the
streets
not
more
than
ten
minutes
after
i
had
met
bowles
i
was
delighted
to
see
that
the
ugly
hump
had
disappeared
and
that
my
little
friend
was
effectually
cured
i
hurriedly
gave
him
a
description
of
bowles
and
told
him
in
which
direction
the
murderer
had
gone
requesting
him
to
follow
and
try
to
find
him
i
did
not
see
robert
any
more
or
hear
a
word
from
him
for
two
months
and
i
concluded
that
he
had
returned
to
his
home
in
memphis
but
not
so
the
noble
little
hero
was
tracking
the
great
outlaw
i
can
not
command
language
to
describe
the
surprise
as
well
as
joy
i
felt
when
i
received
a
telegram
from
my
little
hero
informing
me
that
bowles
was
on
his
way
to
mexico
and
would
probably
stop
a
few
days
at
new
orleans
and
advising
me
to
come
down
there
as
soon
as
i
could
he
also
requested
me
to
inquire
for
a
dispatch
that
he
would
send
to
memphis
which
would
meet
me
there
on
my
way
to
new
orleans
he
was
at
friar
s
point
mississippi
where
bowles
had
stopped
to
wait
for
one
of
his
pals
who
had
agreed
to
meet
him
there
mr
gaterine
kindly
consented
to
go
with
me
to
new
orleans
and
when
i
arrived
at
memphis
i
found
the
promised
telegram
which
informed
me
that
bowles
was
still
at
friar
s
point
the
white
rose
being
the
first
boat
that
would
start
for
new
orleans
we
concluded
to
take
passage
on
her
but
learning
that
lottie
and
edward
had
been
married
on
the
day
before
i
reached
memphis
and
that
they
were
going
on
a
bridal
tour
to
the
crescent
city
i
at
once
procured
a
black
domino
and
mask
to
wear
in
order
to
keep
them
from
knowing
me
i
am
sure
that
i
could
not
have
sufficiently
disguised
my
voice
to
have
enabled
me
to
deceive
lottie
had
it
not
been
for
a
severe
cold
which
although
quite
painful
i
was
glad
to
endure
as
long
as
it
would
aid
me
in
the
accomplishment
of
my
purpose
it
was
my
intention
to
leave
the
boat
at
friar
s
point
but
soon
after
the
white
rose
landed
i
was
delighted
to
see
my
little
detective
come
aboard
he
informed
me
that
bowles
had
just
come
aboard
and
was
going
to
new
orleans
on
the
white
i
was
overjoyed
at
this
information
you
doubtless
remember
that
we
landed
at
friar
s
point
in
the
night
if
i
remember
correctly
it
was
about
three
o
clock
in
the
morning
and
you
must
know
how
bitter
was
my
disappointment
next
morning
when
after
a
diligent
search
we
failed
to
find
bowles
i
soon
ascertained
from
inquiries
made
that
the
white
rose
had
not
landed
since
we
left
friar
s
point
which
led
me
to
believe
that
our
man
was
concealed
somewhere
on
the
boat
my
little
detective
was
of
the
same
opinion
and
i
knew
that
if
it
was
as
we
suspected
that
he
would
soon
discover
where
the
murderer
was
hidden
i
do
not
know
what
it
was
that
caused
robert
to
suspect
napoleon
but
nevertheless
i
soon
learned
from
him
that
he
did
suspect
him
of
being
the
man
we
were
after
it
was
some
time
before
he
succeeded
in
convincing
himself
that
his
suspicions
were
well
founded
by
some
means
which
i
did
not
care
to
know
he
succeeded
in
effecting
an
entrance
to
the
occupied
by
napoleon
when
sure
enough
he
discovered
that
it
was
bowles
all
the
stolen
money
and
other
property
was
found
hidden
in
an
old
boot
under
the
bed
and
when
i
found
out
that
it
was
stolen
property
i
instructed
my
little
friend
to
bring
it
to
me
which
he
yes
exclaimed
wallingford
and
i
promise
you
now
viola
that
your
brave
little
friend
shall
never
know
what
it
is
to
want
for
anything
as
long
as
he
thank
you
harry
a
thousand
times
i
thank
you
replied
miss
bramlett
as
fresh
tears
began
to
trickle
down
her
cheeks
but
you
must
let
me
finish
my
story
well
my
little
friend
ascertained
that
bowles
had
paid
fifty
dollars
to
the
gentleman
who
originally
personated
the
emperor
napoleon
for
his
uniform
and
mask
and
you
must
not
blame
that
gentleman
for
selling
his
costume
to
bowles
because
he
did
not
know
he
was
aiding
a
cruel
murderer
to
escape
but
he
was
tired
of
the
nonsense
as
he
was
pleased
to
call
it
and
finding
a
chance
to
get
his
money
back
he
at
once
closed
the
trade
believing
that
the
purchaser
merely
wished
to
enjoy
a
little
innocent
sport
by
deceiving
the
ladies
as
soon
as
i
ascertained
the
fact
that
the
money
and
other
valuable
things
had
been
stolen
i
resolved
to
restore
them
to
their
owners
but
before
i
could
carry
out
my
intentions
in
that
respect
captain
quitman
inaugurated
his
plans
to
make
a
search
the
result
of
which
you
already
yes
said
harry
that
is
all
very
well
explained
but
how
did
the
dead
woman
happen
to
have
my
ring
i
think
i
can
explain
that
also
replied
miss
bramlett
soon
after
i
arrived
in
new
york
i
engaged
a
young
irish
woman
to
serve
me
as
waiting
maid
and
soon
after
she
entered
my
service
i
began
to
miss
little
articles
which
i
at
first
supposed
were
accidentally
lost
or
mislaid
but
it
was
not
long
before
i
became
convinced
that
they
were
stolen
one
of
my
dresses
a
drab
silk
mysteriously
disappeared
then
my
ring
and
various
other
valuable
articles
were
missing
and
when
i
became
convinced
that
my
maid
was
a
thief
i
discharged
her
it
is
clear
to
my
mind
that
the
unfortunate
woman
was
wearing
my
dress
and
ring
when
she
was
viola
said
wallingford
in
a
voice
choking
with
deep
emotion
did
you
recognize
me
in
my
navarre
costume
yes
indeed
i
how
could
you
remain
near
me
so
long
without
speaking
to
me
do
you
not
know
that
i
would
have
swum
through
lakes
of
fire
to
have
found
you
viola
s
voice
now
for
the
first
time
refused
to
obey
her
will
and
she
was
unable
to
make
any
reply
her
eyes
were
bent
on
the
ground
while
the
violent
throbbings
of
her
heart
could
be
distinctly
heard
by
lottie
who
sat
near
her
viola
continued
wallingford
will
you
not
try
to
love
me
a
little
no
she
replied
in
a
trembling
tone
which
seemed
to
be
uttered
with
an
effort
why
because
i
do
not
think
it
would
be
good
for
me
to
love
any
one
more
than
i
have
loved
you
for
the
last
ten
now
stop
that
harry
exclaimed
demar
as
he
approached
the
group
you
may
embrace
miss
bramlett
if
you
wish
but
to
have
two
women
in
your
arms
at
once
is
a
little
too
much
i
think
you
are
very
selfish
you
may
embrace
miss
bramlett
as
often
as
she
will
allow
it
but
you
must
not
be
quite
so
familiar
with
my
leave
me
alone
with
viola
immediately
i
beseech
you
ed
wallingford
whispered
as
he
placed
his
mouth
close
to
his
ear
pray
go
quick
and
take
lottie
with
you
i
think
viola
is
now
in
the
notion
to
pardon
the
past
errors
and
i
hope
and
believe
she
will
promise
to
marry
come
lottie
said
demar
endeavoring
to
assume
an
indifferent
tone
let
us
take
a
little
stroll
together
as
i
have
a
little
secret
to
tell
you
i
suppose
miss
bramlett
can
take
care
of
your
brother
while
we
are
as
soon
as
demar
and
his
wife
were
gone
an
embarrassing
pause
ensued
while
harry
and
miss
bramlett
silently
inspected
the
floor
each
one
could
distinctly
hear
the
violent
throbbings
of
the
other
s
heart
viola
harry
said
after
a
full
five
minutes
had
been
spent
in
silence
dare
i
ask
you
to
forgive
the
great
wrong
that
i
have
done
to
you
no
answer
i
know
that
i
do
not
deserve
nor
have
i
the
right
to
expect
your
pardon
yet
i
am
very
unhappy
in
thinking
that
you
must
entertain
a
very
unfavorable
opinion
of
the
contemptible
part
i
played
in
that
unfortunate
affair
at
harry
how
could
you
ask
me
to
forgive
you
when
you
must
know
that
my
heart
is
overflowing
with
gratitude
to
you
for
the
valuable
assistance
you
rendered
in
that
affair
you
must
indeed
have
a
poor
opinion
of
me
if
you
could
for
a
moment
suppose
that
i
could
ever
forget
your
noble
generous
exertions
in
my
behalf
if
i
were
to
live
a
hundred
years
i
would
remember
you
and
your
sweet
sister
with
sentiments
of
the
deepest
gratitude
it
is
i
who
should
seek
forgiveness
and
i
do
here
now
most
sincerely
declare
that
no
act
that
i
have
ever
committed
has
caused
me
half
the
pain
shame
and
mortification
that
my
hateful
temper
caused
me
to
feel
by
inducing
me
to
insult
you
that
day
in
jail
if
you
can
forget
and
forgive
me
for
that
despicable
conduct
you
are
indeed
the
most
generous
man
viola
you
and
i
have
had
many
trials
and
much
trouble
and
suffered
much
sorrow
since
we
first
met
and
we
have
no
doubt
learned
some
valuable
lessons
which
i
have
reason
to
believe
will
prove
a
blessing
in
the
end
the
hand
of
a
kind
providence
seems
to
have
guided
our
destinies
he
first
used
me
as
his
instrument
in
saving
your
life
many
years
ago
and
then
enabled
you
to
save
mine
the
other
day
therefore
let
us
agree
to
let
be
forgotten
while
we
endeavor
to
profit
by
the
sad
lessons
taught
us
by
i
say
amen
to
that

all
my
now
darling

as
you
do
the
numerous
faults
and
imperfections

unfortunately
belong

my
nature

trust
your
happiness

me

you
confirm
my
hopes
of
happiness

you
willing
to
marry
a
pauper

t
mention
the
money
question
i
implore
yes
but
i
must
mention
it
because
i
owe
at
least
ten
thousand
dollars
and
have
no
money

wish
it
was
five
times
ten
thousand
then
i
would
have
the
more
pleasure
in
paying

willing
to
take
such

all
her
faults
and
debts

is
my
hand
and
you
have
been
the
sole

life

promise

chapter

three
years
after
the
white
rose
of
memphis
had
accomplished
her
memorable
pleasure
trip
two
elegantly
dressed
ladies
were
leisurely
strolling
along
the
graveled
walks
in
court
square
memphis
tennessee
engaged
in
an
earnest
conversation
while
two
mulatto
girls
were
pushing
a
couple
of
baby
carriages
along
just
behind
the
two
ladies
each
one
of
the
handsome
vehicles
contained
a
very
small
specimen
of
sleeping
humanity
richly
attired
in
expensive
and
stylish
clothes
one
of
the
children
a
bright
boy
about
two
years
old
with
bright
brown
curly
hair
woke
up
and
when
he
saw
a
large
number
of
pretty
pet
squirrels
hopping
about
near
his
carriage
he
became
greatly
excited
hurriedly
clambering
out
he
hastened
to
where
the
little
girl
lay
soundly
sleeping
and
tried
to
wake
her
dit
up
ottie
said
he
as
he
began
to
tug
at
her
gown
see
petty
the
little
girl
did
not
respond
for
she
was
sleeping
very
soundly
but
he
was
determined
to
make
her
get
up
when
he
found
that
he
could
not
accomplish
his
object
by
gentle
means
he
resorted
to
those
of
a
more
vigorous
nature
seizing
her
left
ear
between
his
finger
and
thumb
he
gave
it
a
violent
twist
that
caused
the
little
sleeper
to
start
up
with
a
loud
scream
you
harry
exclaimed
one
of
the
ladies
as
she
hurried
toward
the
carriage

my
dear
good

that

the
very
image
of
his
mother

tells
me
that
viola

harry
were
the
happiest
couple
he
had
ever
seen
except
you
and
eddie
well
i
am
delighted
to
hear
it
if
ever
people
deserved
to
be
happy
you
and
viola
do
because
you
have
suffered
more
than
your
share
i
think
your
husband
is
one
of
the
noblest
specimens
of
humanity
i
ever
saw
this
is
saying
a
great
deal
but
i
mean
it
and
ralleigh
agrees
with
me
i
must
tell
you
what
a
pretty
joke
was
put
upon
me
by
the
rev
marshall
a
celebrated
minister
of
vicksburg
he
had
been
holding
a
series
of
meetings
here
and
was
a
frequent
visitor
at
our
house
he
is
an
eloquent
orator
and
much
admired
and
beloved
by
all
who
know
him
my
darling
old
papa
is
a
member
of
his
church
and
would
swim
a
river
any
time
to
hear
him
preach
when
marshall
was
about
to
start
to
his
home
in
vicksburg
he
invited
me
to
accompany
him
if
you
will
go
with
me
he
said
i
will
insure
you
to
hear
one
of
the
most
eloquent
sermons
that
you
ever
listened
to
from
a
mere
boy
who
has
lately
been
licensed
to
of
course
i
went
as
my
curiosity
was
aroused
and
marshall
took
me
to
church
the
same
night
we
arrived
at
vicksburg
now
i
had
neglected
to
ask
the
name
of
the
boy
preacher
so
intent
was
i
engaged
in
drawing
his
picture
in
my
mind
the
church
was
a
very
large
one
and
when
marshall
led
me
in
the
house
was
crowded
but
he
succeeded
in
securing
me
a
seat
in
one
corner
some
distance
from
the
pulpit
the
music
was
splendid
the
choir
sang
with
deep
feeling
then
a
pause
and
i
riveted
my
eyes
on
the
pulpit
intently
watching
for
the
appearance
of
this
wonderful
boy
after
gazing
until
i
was
tired
and
impatient
i
picked
up
a
hymn
book
and
began
to
turn
the
leaves
over
when
the
sweet
solemn
tones
of
a
familiar
voice
fell
on
my
ears
looking
up
at
the
pulpit
there
i
saw
harry
wallingford
reading
his
text
if
a
whizzing
had
come
crashing
through
the
house
i
would
have
been
less
startled
i
had
never
heard
an
intimation
that
wallingford
was
a
preacher
i
remembered
him
as
a
proud
passionate
man
of
ungovernable
temper
and
rather
wickedly
inclined
i
was
shedding
tears
like
rain
and
it
cost
me
a
great
struggle
to
keep
from
shouting
aloud
now
i
mean
exactly
what
i
say
when
i
assert
that
it
was
the
most
charming
eloquent
sermon
that
i
ever
heard
his
voice
fell
on
my
ears
like
sweet
music
a
feeling
of
delicious
joy
stole
over
me
and
i
was
overcome
with
happy
emotions
he
closed
his
sermon
with
an
invitation
to
sinners
to
come
forward
and
seek
salvation
and
i
was
one
among
many
who
accepted
the
invitation
and
oh
my
darling
friend
i
do
believe
that
god
in
his
great
mercy
has
pardoned
my
sins
wallingford
delivered
five
sermons
here
and
the
result
was
one
hundred
new
members
to
the
church
mr
marshall
thinks
the
world
and
all
of
wallingford
he
says
that
viola
is
entitled
to
the
credit
of
making
a
preacher
of
her
husband
for
she
made
him
promise
to
serve
god
before
she
married
him
well
how
could
anybody
fail
to
go
to
heaven
with
such
an
angel
to
guide
as
viola
do
you
know
that
i
think
she
is
the
best
woman
on
the
earth
except
one
and
you
know
who
that
is
of
course
if
you
do
not
just
look
into
a
mirror
and
you
will
see
the
one
i
allude
to
i
have
given
my
hand
and
heart
to
a
rebel
and
i
mean
to
show
him
that
a
yankee
heart
can
and
will
love
him
and
i
wish
all
the
people
of
the
north
and
south
loved
each
other
as
well
as
i
love
ralleigh
what
a
great
and
glorious
nation
would
ours
be
now
lottie
dear
until
we
meet
which
will
be
immediately
after
my
marriage
to
visit
you
will
be
bridal
tour
enough
for
me
yours
lovingly
kate
doctor
dodson
died
in
he
was
one
of
the
heroic
victims
who
sacrificed
his
life
while
battling
in
the
ranks
of
the
noble
howards
during
the
yellow
fever
epidemic
dodson
expired
thirty
minutes
before
death
won
the
victory
over
her
husband
she
died
in
a
room
adjoining
the
one
in
which
the
doctor
lay
and
they
endeavored
to
conceal
her
death
from
him
his
mind
was
as
clear
as
a
cloudless
sky
and
when
death
began
to
lay
his
cold
icy
finger
on
his
body
he
took
hold
of
lottie
s
hand
with
his
right
and
viola
s
with
his
left
ah
ha
my
darlings
god
says
i
must
leave
you
for
a
while
yes
i
go
on
before
you
and
i
shall
meet
you
all
again
ah
ha
don
t
you
see
eddie
my
boy
you
are
sure
to
come
to
heaven
lottie
would
fetch
you
anyway
viola
she
has
put
harry
on
the
right
road
you
are
all
safe
ah
ha
yes
you
are
all
safe
then
he
became
quiet
for
a
few
moments
and
they
thought
he
was
dead
but
he
began
to
mutter
strange
words
ah
ha
here
we
come
dolly
wait
for
me
a
moment
we
will
go
to
heaven
together
don
t
you
see
ah
ha
dollary
i
am
coming
there
she
is
lottie
don
t
you
see
her
she
is
beckoning
for
me
to
come
yes
dollary
i
am
coming
ah
ha
dolly
here
we
come
here
we
come
then
the
noble
soul
stepped
out
and
went
with
dolly
to
heaven
the
day
that
dodson
and
his
wife
died
was
to
have
been
their
golden
wedding
but
god
had
prepared
for
them
a
wedding
feast
of
a
different
sort
they
were
buried
in
one
grave
over
which
fragrant
flowers
bloom
every
spring
where
friendly
tears
bedew
the
soil
if
any
one
should
be
disposed
to
think
that
this
world
is
full
of
selfish
people
let
him
go
and
investigate
the
inward
history
of
the
great
epidemics
of
and
and
he
will
soon
see
his
great
error
look
at
the
long
list
of
those
heroic
physicians
who
fell
in
the
of
the
battle
fighting
to
protect
suffering
humanity
remember
the
large
number
of
protestant
clergymen
and
catholic
priests
who
walked
day
after
day
in
the
very
jaws
of
death
comforting
the
sick
wrestling
with
the
dreadful
foe
and
yielding
up
their
lives
that
others
might
live
historians
have
written
and
poets
sung
about
leonidas
and
his
heroic
band
but
if
i
were
a
poet
i
would
find
a
band
of
heroes
at
memphis
whose
brave
deeds
should
be
the
theme
of
my
song
it
is
a
slander
to
say
that
the
world
is
full
of
selfish
men
and
any
one
who
will
investigate
the
history
of
those
awful
times
will
admit
it
harry
wallingford
purchased
a
handsome
residence
situated
in
the
midst
of
a
beautiful
grove
of
native
poplars
just
east
of
rockland
s
and
not
more
than
two
hundred
yards
from
it
viola
had
her
flower
garden
laid
off
so
as
to
adjoin
lottie
s
and
they
were
only
separated
by
a
clean
gravel
walk
those
two
devoted
friends
would
often
seat
themselves
on
a
rustic
bench
in
the
garden
spending
long
hours
watching
the
two
little
children
as
they
frolicked
like
young
lambs
on
the
green
turf
of
the
lawn
viola
said
lottie
i
think
your
boy
has
a
disposition
very
much
like
brother
harry
s
used
to
well
you
ought
to
pity
his
mother
replied
viola
for
that
boy
is
never
satisfied
unless
he
is
doing
something
where
there
is
danger
of
being
by
the
by
viola
yonder

our
obligations

goodness

never
do
that
as
long
as

doctor

lifted
his
pretty
little
daughter
from
the
ground
as
she
came
running
to
meet
him
and
seated
her
on
his
shoulder
and
began
to
dance
round
with
her
while
harry
began
to
romp
with
his
boy
who
was
galloping
about
astraddle
of
a
stick
which
he
was
lashing
with
a
whip
edward
said
lottie
as
she
ran
her
hand
under
his
arm
how
did
you
manage
to
get
here
so
soon
we
did
not
expect
you
for
two
hours
because
we
were
both
in
love
with
our
pretty
wives
and
wanted
to
be
with
them
and
because
we
knew
that
our
wives
