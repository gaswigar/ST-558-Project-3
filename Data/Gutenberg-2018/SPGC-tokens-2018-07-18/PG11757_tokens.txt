christmas
morning
the
skin
horse
tells
his
story
spring
time
summer
days
anxious
times
the
fairy
flower
at
last
at
last
here
was
once
a
velveteen
rabbit
and
in
the
beginning
he
was
really
splendid
he
was
fat
and
bunchy
as
a
rabbit
should
be
his
coat
was
spotted
brown
and
white
he
had
real
thread
whiskers
and
his
ears
were
lined
with
pink
sateen
on
christmas
morning
when
he
sat
wedged
in
the
top
of
the
boy
stocking
with
a
sprig
of
holly
between
his
paws
the
effect
was
charming
there
were
other
things
in
the
stocking
nuts
and
oranges
and
a
toy
engine
and
chocolate
almonds
and
a
clockwork
mouse
but
the
rabbit
was
quite
the
best
of
all
for
at
least
two
hours
the
boy
loved
him
and
then
aunts
and
uncles
came
to
dinner
and
there
was
a
great
rustling
of
tissue
paper
and
unwrapping
of
parcels
and
in
the
excitement
of
looking
at
all
the
new
presents
the
velveteen
rabbit
was
forgotten
christmas
morning
for
a
long
time
he
lived
in
the
toy
cupboard
or
on
the
nursery
floor
and
no
one
thought
very
much
about
him
he
was
naturally
shy
and
being
only
made
of
velveteen
some
of
the
more
expensive
toys
quite
snubbed
him
the
mechanical
toys
were
very
superior
and
looked
down
upon
every
one
else
they
were
full
of
modern
ideas
and
pretended
they
were
real
the
model
boat
who
had
lived
through
two
seasons
and
lost
most
of
his
paint
caught
the
tone
from
them
and
never
missed
an
opportunity
of
referring
to
his
rigging
in
technical
terms
the
rabbit
could
not
claim
to
be
a
model
of
anything
for
he
did
know
that
real
rabbits
existed
he
thought
they
were
all
stuffed
with
sawdust
like
himself
and
he
understood
that
sawdust
was
quite
and
should
never
be
mentioned
in
modern
circles
even
timothy
the
jointed
wooden
lion
who
was
made
by
the
disabled
soldiers
and
should
have
had
broader
views
put
on
airs
and
pretended
he
was
connected
with
government
between
them
all
the
poor
little
rabbit
was
made
to
feel
himself
very
insignificant
and
commonplace
and
the
only
person
who
was
kind
to
him
at
all
was
the
skin
horse
the
skin
horse
had
lived
longer
in
the
nursery
than
any
of
the
others
he
was
so
old
that
his
brown
coat
was
bald
in
patches
and
showed
the
seams
underneath
and
most
of
the
hairs
in
his
tail
had
been
pulled
out
to
string
bead
necklaces
he
was
wise
for
he
had
seen
a
long
succession
of
mechanical
toys
arrive
to
boast
and
swagger
and
break
their
mainsprings
and
pass
away
and
he
knew
that
they
were
only
toys
and
would
never
turn
into
anything
else
for
nursery
magic
is
very
strange
and
wonderful
and
only
those
playthings
that
are
old
and
wise
and
experienced
like
the
skin
horse
understand
all
about
it
what
is
real
asked
the
rabbit
one
day
when
they
were
lying
side
by
side
near
the
nursery
fender
before
nana
came
to
tidy
the
room
does
it
mean
having
things
that
buzz
inside
you
and
a
handle
real
is
how
you
are
made
said
the
skin
horse
it
a
thing
that
happens
to
you
when
a
child
loves
you
for
a
long
long
time
not
just
to
play
with
but
really
loves
you
then
you
become
real
does
it
hurt
asked
the
rabbit
sometimes
said
the
skin
horse
for
he
was
always
truthful
when
you
are
real
you
do
mind
being
hurt
does
it
happen
all
at
once
like
being
wound
up
he
asked
or
bit
by
bit
it
does
happen
all
at
once
said
the
skin
horse
you
become
it
takes
a
long
time
that
why
it
does
happen
often
to
people
who
break
easily
or
have
sharp
edges
or
who
have
to
be
carefully
kept
generally
by
the
time
you
are
real
most
of
your
hair
has
been
loved
off
and
your
eyes
drop
out
and
you
get
loose
in
the
joints
and
very
shabby
but
these
things
do
matter
at
all
because
once
you
are
real
you
ca
be
ugly
except
to
people
who
do
understand
i
suppose
you
are
real
said
the
rabbit
and
then
he
wished
he
had
not
said
it
for
he
thought
the
skin
horse
might
be
sensitive
but
the
skin
horse
only
smiled
the
skin
horse
tells
his
story
the
boy
uncle
made
me
real
he
said
that
was
a
great
many
years
ago
but
once
you
are
real
you
ca
become
unreal
again
it
lasts
for
always
the
rabbit
sighed
he
thought
it
would
be
a
long
time
before
this
magic
called
real
happened
to
him
he
longed
to
become
real
to
know
what
it
felt
like
and
yet
the
idea
of
growing
shabby
and
losing
his
eyes
and
whiskers
was
rather
sad
he
wished
that
he
could
become
it
without
these
uncomfortable
things
happening
to
him
there
was
a
person
called
nana
who
ruled
the
nursery
sometimes
she
took
no
notice
of
the
playthings
lying
about
and
sometimes
for
no
reason
whatever
she
went
swooping
about
like
a
great
wind
and
hustled
them
away
in
cupboards
she
called
this
tidying
up
and
the
playthings
all
hated
it
especially
the
tin
ones
the
rabbit
mind
it
so
much
for
wherever
he
was
thrown
he
came
down
soft
one
evening
when
the
boy
was
going
to
bed
he
could
find
the
china
dog
that
always
slept
with
him
nana
was
in
a
hurry
and
it
was
too
much
trouble
to
hunt
for
china
dogs
at
bedtime
so
she
simply
looked
about
her
and
seeing
that
the
toy
cupboard
door
stood
open
she
made
a
swoop
here
she
said
take
your
old
bunny
he
do
to
sleep
with
you
and
she
dragged
the
rabbit
out
by
one
ear
and
put
him
into
the
arms
that
night
and
for
many
nights
after
the
velveteen
rabbit
slept
in
the
boy
bed
at
first
he
found
it
rather
uncomfortable
for
the
boy
hugged
him
very
tight
and
sometimes
he
rolled
over
on
him
and
sometimes
he
pushed
him
so
far
under
the
pillow
that
the
rabbit
could
scarcely
breathe
and
he
missed
too
those
long
moonlight
hours
in
the
nursery
when
all
the
house
was
silent
and
his
talks
with
the
skin
horse
but
very
soon
he
grew
to
like
it
for
the
boy
used
to
talk
to
him
and
made
nice
tunnels
for
him
under
the
bedclothes
that
he
said
were
like
the
burrows
the
real
rabbits
lived
in
and
they
had
splendid
games
together
in
whispers
when
nana
had
gone
away
to
her
supper
and
left
the
burning
on
the
mantelpiece
and
when
the
boy
dropped
off
to
sleep
the
rabbit
would
snuggle
down
close
under
his
little
warm
chin
and
dream
with
the
boy
hands
clasped
close
round
him
all
night
long
and
so
time
went
on
and
the
little
rabbit
was
very
happy
that
he
never
noticed
how
his
beautiful
velveteen
fur
was
getting
shabbier
and
shabbier
and
his
tail
becoming
unsewn
and
all
the
pink
rubbed
off
his
nose
where
the
boy
had
kissed
him
spring
came
and
they
had
long
days
in
the
garden
for
wherever
the
boy
went
the
rabbit
went
too
he
had
rides
in
the
wheelbarrow
and
picnics
on
the
grass
and
lovely
fairy
huts
built
for
him
under
the
raspberry
canes
behind
the
flower
border
and
once
when
the
boy
was
called
away
suddenly
to
go
out
to
tea
the
rabbit
was
left
out
on
the
lawn
until
long
after
dusk
and
nana
had
to
come
and
look
for
him
with
the
candle
because
the
boy
could
go
to
sleep
unless
he
was
there
he
was
wet
through
with
the
dew
and
quite
earthy
from
diving
into
the
burrows
the
boy
had
made
for
him
in
the
flower
bed
and
nana
grumbled
as
she
rubbed
him
off
with
a
corner
of
her
apron
spring
time
you
must
have
your
old
bunny
she
said
fancy
all
that
fuss
for
a
toy
the
boy
sat
up
in
bed
and
stretched
out
his
hands
give
me
my
bunny
he
said
you
must
say
that
he
is
a
toy
he
real
when
the
little
rabbit
heard
that
he
was
happy
for
he
knew
that
what
the
skin
horse
had
said
was
true
at
last
the
nursery
magic
had
happened
to
him
and
he
was
a
toy
no
longer
he
was
real
the
boy
himself
had
said
it
that
night
he
was
almost
too
happy
to
sleep
and
so
much
love
stirred
in
his
little
sawdust
heart
that
it
almost
burst
and
into
his
eyes
that
had
long
ago
lost
their
polish
there
came
a
look
of
wisdom
and
beauty
so
that
even
nana
noticed
it
next
morning
when
she
picked
him
up
and
said
i
declare
if
that
old
bunny
got
quite
a
knowing
expression
that
was
a
wonderful
summer
near
the
house
where
they
lived
there
was
a
wood
and
in
the
long
june
evenings
the
boy
liked
to
go
there
after
tea
to
play
he
took
the
velveteen
rabbit
with
him
and
before
he
wandered
off
to
pick
flowers
or
play
at
brigands
among
the
trees
he
always
made
the
rabbit
a
little
nest
somewhere
among
the
bracken
where
he
would
be
quite
cosy
for
he
was
a
little
boy
and
he
liked
bunny
to
be
comfortable
one
evening
while
the
rabbit
was
lying
there
alone
watching
the
ants
that
ran
to
and
fro
between
his
velvet
paws
in
the
grass
he
saw
two
strange
beings
creep
out
of
the
tall
bracken
near
him
they
were
rabbits
like
himself
but
quite
furry
and
they
must
have
been
very
well
made
for
their
seams
did
show
at
all
and
they
changed
shape
in
a
queer
way
when
they
moved
one
minute
they
were
long
and
thin
and
the
next
minute
fat
and
bunchy
instead
of
always
staying
the
same
like
he
did
their
feet
padded
softly
on
the
ground
and
they
crept
quite
close
to
him
twitching
their
noses
while
the
rabbit
stared
hard
to
see
which
side
the
clockwork
stuck
out
for
he
knew
that
people
who
jump
generally
have
something
to
wind
them
up
but
he
could
see
it
they
were
evidently
a
new
kind
of
rabbit
altogether
summer
days
they
stared
at
him
and
the
little
rabbit
stared
back
and
all
the
time
their
noses
twitched
why
do
you
get
up
and
play
with
us
one
of
them
asked
i
do
feel
like
it
said
the
rabbit
for
he
did
want
to
explain
that
he
had
no
clockwork
ho
said
the
furry
rabbit
it
as
easy
as
anything
and
he
gave
a
big
hop
sideways
and
stood
on
his
hind
legs
i
do
believe
you
can
he
said
i
can
said
the
little
rabbit
i
can
jump
higher
than
anything
he
meant
when
the
boy
threw
him
but
of
course
he
did
want
to
say
so
can
you
hop
on
your
hind
legs
asked
the
furry
rabbit
that
was
a
dreadful
question
for
the
velveteen
rabbit
had
no
hind
legs
at
all
the
back
of
him
was
made
all
in
one
piece
like
a
pincushion
he
sat
still
in
the
bracken
and
hoped
that
the
other
rabbits
would
notice
i
do
want
to
he
said
again
but
the
wild
rabbits
have
very
sharp
eyes
and
this
one
stretched
out
his
neck
and
looked
he
has
got
any
hind
legs
he
called
out
fancy
a
rabbit
without
any
hind
legs
and
he
began
to
laugh
i
have
cried
the
little
rabbit
i
have
got
hind
legs
i
am
sitting
on
them
then
stretch
them
out
and
show
me
like
this
said
the
wild
rabbit
and
he
began
to
whirl
round
and
dance
till
the
little
rabbit
got
quite
dizzy
i
do
like
dancing
he
said
i
rather
sit
still
but
all
the
while
he
was
longing
to
dance
for
a
funny
new
tickly
feeling
ran
through
him
and
he
felt
he
would
give
anything
in
the
world
to
be
able
to
jump
about
like
these
rabbits
did
the
strange
rabbit
stopped
dancing
and
came
quite
close
he
came
so
close
this
time
that
his
long
whiskers
brushed
the
velveteen
ear
and
then
he
wrinkled
his
nose
suddenly
and
flattened
his
ears
and
jumped
backwards
he
does
smell
right
he
exclaimed
he
is
a
rabbit
at
all
he
is
real
i
am
real
said
the
little
rabbit
i
am
real
the
boy
said
so
and
he
nearly
began
to
cry
just
then
there
was
a
sound
of
footsteps
and
the
boy
ran
past
near
them
and
with
a
stamp
of
feet
and
a
flash
of
white
tails
the
two
strange
rabbits
disappeared
come
back
and
play
with
me
called
the
little
rabbit
oh
do
come
back
i
know
i
am
real
but
there
was
no
answer
only
the
little
ants
ran
to
and
fro
and
the
bracken
swayed
gently
where
the
two
strangers
had
passed
the
velveteen
rabbit
was
all
alone
oh
dear
he
thought
why
did
they
run
away
like
that
why
they
stop
and
talk
to
me
for
a
long
time
he
lay
very
still
watching
the
bracken
and
hoping
that
they
would
come
back
but
they
never
returned
and
presently
the
sun
sank
lower
and
the
little
white
moths
fluttered
out
and
the
boy
came
and
carried
him
home
weeks
passed
and
the
little
rabbit
grew
very
old
and
shabby
but
the
boy
loved
him
just
as
much
he
loved
him
so
hard
that
he
loved
all
his
whiskers
off
and
the
pink
lining
to
his
ears
turned
grey
and
his
brown
spots
faded
he
even
began
to
lose
his
shape
and
he
scarcely
looked
like
a
rabbit
any
more
except
to
the
boy
to
him
he
was
always
beautiful
and
that
was
all
that
the
little
rabbit
cared
about
he
did
mind
how
he
looked
to
other
people
because
the
nursery
magic
had
made
him
real
and
when
you
are
real
shabbiness
does
matter
and
then
one
day
the
boy
was
his
face
grew
very
flushed
and
he
talked
in
his
sleep
and
his
little
body
was
so
hot
that
it
burned
the
rabbit
when
he
held
him
close
strange
people
came
and
went
in
the
nursery
and
a
light
burned
all
night
and
through
it
all
the
little
velveteen
rabbit
lay
there
hidden
from
sight
under
the
bedclothes
and
he
never
stirred
for
he
was
afraid
that
if
they
found
him
some
one
might
take
him
away
and
he
knew
that
the
boy
needed
him
it
was
a
long
weary
time
for
the
boy
was
too
ill
to
play
and
the
little
rabbit
found
it
rather
dull
with
nothing
to
do
all
day
long
but
he
snuggled
down
patiently
and
looked
forward
to
the
time
when
the
boy
should
be
well
again
and
they
would
go
out
in
the
garden
amongst
the
flowers
and
the
butterflies
and
play
splendid
games
in
the
raspberry
thicket
like
they
used
to
all
sorts
of
delightful
things
he
planned
and
while
the
boy
lay
half
asleep
he
crept
up
close
to
the
pillow
and
whispered
them
in
his
ear
and
presently
the
fever
turned
and
the
boy
got
better
he
was
able
to
sit
up
in
bed
and
look
at
while
the
little
rabbit
cuddled
close
at
his
side
and
one
day
they
let
him
get
up
and
dress
it
was
a
bright
sunny
morning
and
the
windows
stood
wide
open
they
had
carried
the
boy
out
on
to
the
balcony
wrapped
in
a
shawl
and
the
little
rabbit
lay
tangled
up
among
the
bedclothes
thinking
the
boy
was
going
to
the
seaside
everything
was
arranged
and
now
it
only
remained
to
carry
out
the
doctor
orders
they
talked
about
it
all
while
the
little
rabbit
lay
under
the
bedclothes
with
just
his
head
peeping
out
and
listened
the
room
was
to
be
disinfected
and
all
the
books
and
toys
that
the
boy
had
played
with
in
bed
must
be
burnt
hurrah
thought
the
little
rabbit
we
shall
go
to
the
seaside
for
the
boy
had
often
talked
of
the
seaside
and
he
wanted
very
much
to
see
the
big
waves
coming
in
and
the
tiny
crabs
and
the
sand
castles
just
then
nana
caught
sight
of
him
how
about
his
old
bunny
she
asked
that
said
the
doctor
why
it
a
mass
of
scarlet
fever
germs
it
at
once
what
nonsense
get
him
a
new
one
he
have
that
any
more
anxious
times
and
so
the
little
rabbit
was
put
into
a
sack
with
the
old
and
a
lot
of
rubbish
and
carried
out
to
the
end
of
the
garden
behind
the
that
was
a
fine
place
to
make
a
bonfire
only
the
gardener
was
too
busy
just
then
to
attend
to
it
he
had
the
potatoes
to
dig
and
the
green
peas
to
gather
but
next
morning
he
promised
to
come
quite
early
and
burn
the
whole
lot
that
night
the
boy
slept
in
a
different
bedroom
and
he
had
a
new
bunny
to
sleep
with
him
it
was
a
splendid
bunny
all
white
plush
with
real
glass
eyes
but
the
boy
was
too
excited
to
care
very
much
about
it
for
he
was
going
to
the
seaside
and
that
in
itself
was
such
a
wonderful
thing
that
he
could
think
of
nothing
else
and
while
the
boy
was
asleep
dreaming
of
the
seaside
the
little
rabbit
lay
among
the
old
in
the
corner
behind
the
and
he
felt
very
lonely
the
sack
had
been
left
untied
and
so
by
wriggling
a
bit
he
was
able
to
get
his
head
through
the
opening
and
look
out
he
was
shivering
a
little
for
he
had
always
been
used
to
sleeping
in
a
proper
bed
and
by
this
time
his
coat
had
worn
so
thin
and
threadbare
from
hugging
that
it
was
no
longer
any
protection
to
him
near
by
he
could
see
the
thicket
of
raspberry
canes
growing
tall
and
close
like
a
tropical
jungle
in
whose
shadow
he
had
played
with
the
boy
on
bygone
mornings
he
thought
of
those
long
sunlit
hours
in
the
happy
they
a
great
sadness
came
over
him
he
seemed
to
see
them
all
pass
before
him
each
more
beautiful
than
the
other
the
fairy
huts
in
the
the
quiet
evenings
in
the
wood
when
he
lay
in
the
bracken
and
the
little
ants
ran
over
his
paws
the
wonderful
day
when
he
first
knew
that
he
was
real
he
thought
of
the
skin
horse
so
wise
and
gentle
and
all
that
he
had
told
him
of
what
use
was
it
to
be
loved
and
lose
beauty
and
become
real
if
it
all
ended
like
this
and
a
tear
a
real
tear
trickled
down
his
little
shabby
velvet
nose
and
fell
to
the
ground
and
then
a
strange
thing
happened
for
where
the
tear
had
fallen
a
flower
grew
out
of
the
ground
a
mysterious
flower
not
at
all
like
any
that
grew
in
the
garden
it
had
slender
green
leaves
the
colour
of
emeralds
and
in
the
centre
of
the
leaves
a
blossom
like
a
golden
cup
it
was
so
beautiful
that
the
little
rabbit
forgot
to
cry
and
just
lay
there
watching
it
and
presently
the
blossom
opened
and
out
of
it
there
stepped
a
fairy
she
was
quite
the
loveliest
fairy
in
the
whole
world
her
dress
was
of
pearl
and
and
there
were
flowers
round
her
neck
and
in
her
hair
and
her
face
was
like
the
most
perfect
flower
of
all
and
she
came
close
to
the
little
rabbit
and
gathered
him
up
in
her
arms
and
kissed
him
on
his
velveteen
nose
that
was
all
damp
from
crying
little
rabbit
she
said
do
you
know
who
i
am
the
rabbit
looked
up
at
her
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
seen
her
face
before
but
he
could
think
where
i
am
the
nursery
magic
fairy
she
said
i
take
care
of
all
the
playthings
that
the
children
have
loved
when
they
are
old
and
worn
out
and
the
children
do
need
them
any
more
then
i
come
and
take
them
away
with
me
and
turn
them
into
real
was
i
real
before
asked
the
little
rabbit
you
were
real
to
the
boy
the
fairy
said
because
he
loved
you
now
you
shall
be
real
to
every
one
the
fairy
flower
and
she
held
the
little
rabbit
close
in
her
arms
and
flew
with
him
into
the
wood
it
was
light
now
for
the
moon
had
risen
all
the
forest
was
beautiful
and
the
fronds
of
the
bracken
shone
like
frosted
silver
in
the
open
glade
between
the
the
wild
rabbits
danced
with
their
shadows
on
the
velvet
grass
but
when
they
saw
the
fairy
they
all
stopped
dancing
and
stood
round
in
a
ring
to
stare
at
her
i
brought
you
a
new
playfellow
the
fairy
said
you
must
be
very
kind
to
him
and
teach
him
all
he
needs
to
know
in
for
he
is
going
to
live
with
you
for
ever
and
ever
and
she
kissed
the
little
rabbit
again
and
put
him
down
on
the
grass
run
and
play
little
rabbit
she
said
but
the
little
rabbit
sat
quite
still
for
a
moment
and
never
moved
for
when
he
saw
all
the
wild
rabbits
dancing
around
him
he
suddenly
remembered
about
his
hind
legs
and
he
did
want
them
to
see
that
he
was
made
all
in
one
piece
he
did
not
know
that
when
the
fairy
kissed
him
that
last
time
she
had
changed
him
altogether
and
he
might
have
sat
there
a
long
time
too
shy
to
move
if
just
then
something
tickled
his
nose
and
before
he
thought
what
he
was
doing
he
lifted
his
hind
toe
to
scratch
it
and
he
found
that
he
actually
had
hind
legs
instead
of
dingy
velveteen
he
had
brown
fur
soft
and
shiny
his
ears
twitched
by
themselves
and
his
whiskers
were
so
long
that
they
brushed
the
grass
he
gave
one
leap
and
the
joy
of
using
those
hind
legs
was
so
great
that
he
went
springing
about
the
turf
on
them
jumping
sideways
and
whirling
round
as
the
others
did
and
he
grew
so
excited
that
when
at
last
he
did
stop
to
look
for
the
fairy
she
had
gone
he
was
a
real
rabbit
at
last
at
home
with
the
other
rabbits
at
last
at
last
autumn
passed
and
winter
and
in
the
spring
when
the
days
grew
warm
and
sunny
the
boy
went
out
to
play
in
the
wood
behind
the
house
and
while
he
was
playing
two
rabbits
crept
out
from
the
bracken
and
peeped
at
him
one
of
them
was
brown
all
over
but
the
other
had
strange
markings
under
his
fur
as
though
long
ago
he
had
been
spotted
and
the
spots
still
showed
through
and
about
his
little
soft
nose
and
his
round
black
eyes
there
was
something
familiar
so
that
the
boy
thought
to
himself
why
he
looks
just
like
my
old
bunny
that
was
lost
when
i
had
scarlet
fever
but
he
never
knew
that
it
really
was
his
own
bunny
come
back
to
look
at
the
child
who
had
first
helped
him
to
be
real
