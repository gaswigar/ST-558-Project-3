preface
to
the
third
edition
before
the
third
edition
of
this
work
had
been
published
the
author
passed
away
from
sudden
failure
of
the
heart
at
the
early
age
of
two
or
three
biographical
notices
written
by
those
who
highly
appreciated
him
and
who
deeply
mourn
his
loss
have
already
appeared
in
the
newspapers
and
i
therefore
wish
to
add
only
a
few
words
about
one
whose
kind
smile
of
welcome
will
greet
us
no
more
in
this
life
joseph
arthur
gibbs
was
one
of
those
rare
natures
who
combine
a
love
of
outdoor
life
cricket
and
sport
of
every
kind
with
a
refined
and
scholarly
taste
for
literature
he
had
like
his
father
a
keen
observation
for
every
detail
in
nature
and
from
a
habit
of
patient
watchfulness
he
acquired
great
knowledge
of
natural
history
from
his
grandfather
the
late
sir
arthur
hallam
elton
he
inherited
his
taste
for
literary
work
and
the
deep
poetical
feeling
which
are
revealed
so
clearly
in
his
book
on
leaving
eton
he
wrote
a
of
which
his
tutor
luxmoore
expressed
his
high
appreciation
and
later
on
when
after
leaving
oxford
he
was
living
a
quiet
country
life
he
devoted
himself
to
literary
pursuits
he
was
not
however
so
engrossed
in
his
work
as
to
ignore
other
duties
and
he
was
especially
interested
in
the
villagers
round
his
home
and
ever
ready
to
give
what
is
of
greater
value
than
money
personal
trouble
and
time
in
finding
out
their
wants
and
in
relieving
them
his
unvarying
kindness
and
sympathy
will
never
be
forgotten
at
ablington
for
as
one
of
the
villagers
wrote
in
a
letter
of
condolence
on
hearing
of
his
death
he
went
in
and
out
as
a
friend
among
them
with
all
his
tenderness
of
heart
he
had
a
strict
sense
of
justice
and
a
clear
judgment
and
weighed
carefully
both
sides
of
any
question
before
he
gave
his
verdict
arthur
gibbs
went
abroad
at
the
end
of
march
for
a
month
trip
to
italy
and
in
his
journal
he
wrote
many
good
descriptions
of
scenery
and
of
the
old
towns
and
the
way
in
which
he
describes
his
last
glimpse
of
florence
during
a
glorious
sunset
shows
how
greatly
he
appreciated
its
beauty
in
his
journal
in
april
he
dwells
on
the
shortness
of
life
and
in
the
following
solemn
words
he
sounds
a
warning
note
do
not
neglect
the
creeping
hours
of
time
night
cometh
when
no
man
can
work
all
time
is
wasted
unless
spent
in
work
for
god
the
best
secular
way
of
spending
the
precious
thing
that
men
call
time
is
by
making
always
for
some
grand
end
a
great
book
to
show
forth
the
wonders
of
creation
and
the
infinite
goodness
of
the
creator
you
must
influence
for
if
you
write
and
write
nothing
that
you
will
regret
some
day
or
think
trivial
these
words
written
a
month
before
the
end
came
tell
their
own
tale
the
writer
of
them
had
a
deep
love
for
all
things
that
are
lovely
pure
and
of
good
report
and
in
his
book
one
sees
clearly
the
adoration
he
felt
for
that
god
whom
he
so
faithfully
served
there
are
many
different
kinds
of
work
in
this
world
and
diversities
of
gifts
to
him
was
given
the
spirit
to
discern
the
work
of
god
in
nature
glory
and
the
power
to
win
others
to
see
it
also
he
had
a
remarkable
influence
for
good
at
oxford
and
the
letters
from
his
numerous
friends
and
from
his
former
tutor
at
christ
church
show
that
this
influence
has
never
been
forgotten
but
has
left
its
mark
not
only
on
his
college
but
on
the
university
like
his
namesake
and
relative
arthur
hallam
of
immortal
memory
arthur
gibbs
had
attained
to
a
purity
of
soul
and
a
wisdom
which
were
not
of
this
world
at
an
earlier
age
than
is
given
to
many
men
and
so
in
love
and
faith
and
hope
i
would
the
great
world
grew
like
thee
who
grewest
not
alone
in
power
and
knowledge
but
by
year
and
hour
in
reverence
and
charity

preface
to
the
first
edition
to
those
of
my
readers
who
have
ever
lived
beside
a
stream
or
in
an
ancient
house
or
college
there
will
always
be
a
peculiar
charm
in
silvery
waters
sparkling
beneath
the
summer
sun
to
you
the
gothic
building
with
its
carved
pinnacles
its
warped
gables
its
mullioned
casements
and
dormer
windows
the
old
oak
within
the
very
inglenook
by
the
great
fireplace
where
the
old
folks
used
to
sit
at
home
the
ivy
trailing
round
the
grey
walls
the
jessamine
roses
and
clematis
that
in
their
proper
seasons
clustered
round
the
porch
to
you
all
these
things
will
have
their
charm
as
long
as
you
live
therefore
if
these
pages
appeal
not
to
some
such
it
will
not
be
the
subject
that
is
wanting
but
the
ability
of
the
writer
it
is
not
claimed
for
my
cotswold
village
that
it
is
one
whit
prettier
or
pleasanter
or
better
in
any
way
than
hundreds
of
other
villages
in
england
i
seek
only
to
record
the
simple
annals
of
a
quiet
gloucestershire
hamlet
and
the
country
within
walking
distance
of
it
nor
do
i
doubt
that
there
are
manor
houses
far
more
beautiful
and
far
richer
in
history
even
within
a
radius
of
my
own
home
for
instance
the
ancient
house
of
chavenage
by
tetbury
or
in
the
opposite
direction
where
the
northern
escarpments
of
the
cotswolds
rise
out
of
the
beautiful
evesham
vale
those
historic
mediaeval
houses
of
southam
and
postlip
it
is
often
said
that
in
books
like
these
we
paint
arcadias
that
never
did
and
never
could
exist
on
earth
to
this
i
would
answer
that
there
are
many
such
abodes
in
country
places
if
only
our
minds
are
such
as
to
realise
them
and
above
all
let
us
be
optimists
in
literature
even
though
we
may
be
pessimists
in
life
let
us
have
all
that
is
joyous
and
bright
in
our
books
and
leave
the
trials
and
failures
for
the
realities
of
life
let
us
in
our
literature
avoid
as
much
as
possible
the
painful
side
of
human
nature
and
the
pains
and
penalties
of
human
weakness
let
us
endeavour
to
depict
a
state
of
existence
as
far
as
possible
approaching
the
utopian
ideal
though
not
necessarily
the
nirvana
of
the
buddhists
nor
the
paradise
of
fools
let
us
look
not
downwards
into
the
depths
of
black
despair
but
upwards
into
the
starry
heavens
let
us
gaze
at
the
golden
evening
brightening
in
the
west
richard
jefferies
has
taught
us
that
such
a
literature
is
possible
and
if
we
read
his
best
books
we
may
some
day
be
granted
that
fuller
soul
he
prayed
for
and
at
length
obtained
would
that
we
could
all
hear
as
he
heard
the
still
small
voice
that
whispers
in
the
woods
and
among
the
wild
flowers
and
the
spreading
foliage
by
the
brook
to
any
one
who
might
be
thinking
of
becoming
for
the
time
being
a
tourist
and
in
that
capacity
visiting
the
cotswolds
my
advice
is
do
there
is
really
nothing
to
see
there
is
nothing
that
is
to
say
which
may
not
be
seen
much
nearer
london
and
i
freely
confess
that
most
of
the
subjects
included
in
this
book
are
usually
deemed
unworthy
of
consideration
even
in
the
district
itself
still
there
are
a
few
who
realise
that
every
county
in
england
is
more
or
less
a
mine
of
interest
and
for
such
i
have
written
realising
my
limitations
i
have
not
gone
deeply
into
any
single
subject
my
endeavour
has
been
to
touch
on
every
branch
of
country
life
with
as
light
a
hand
as
possible
to
amuse
rather
than
to
instruct
for
as
washington
irving
delightfully
sums
up
the
matter
it
is
so
much
pleasanter
to
please
than
to
instruct
to
play
the
companion
rather
than
the
preceptor
what
after
all
is
the
mite
of
wisdom
that
i
could
throw
into
the
mass
of
knowledge
or
how
am
i
sure
that
my
sagest
deductions
may
be
safe
guides
for
the
opinions
of
others
but
in
writing
to
amuse
if
i
fail
the
only
evil
is
in
my
own
disappointment
if
however
i
can
by
any
lucky
chance
rub
out
one
wrinkle
from
the
brow
of
care
or
beguile
the
heavy
heart
of
one
moment
of
sorrow
if
i
can
now
and
then
penetrate
through
the
gathering
film
of
misanthropy
prompt
a
benevolent
view
of
human
nature
and
make
my
reader
more
in
good
humour
with
his
fellow
beings
and
himself
surely
surely
i
shall
not
then
have

flying
westwards
london
is
becoming
miserably
hot
and
dusty
everybody
who
can
get
away
is
rushing
off
north
south
east
and
west
some
to
the
seaside
others
to
pleasant
country
houses
who
will
fly
with
me
westwards
to
the
land
of
golden
sunshine
and
silvery
trout
streams
the
land
of
breezy
uplands
and
valleys
nestling
under
limestone
hills
where
the
scream
of
the
railway
whistle
is
seldom
heard
and
the
smoke
of
the
factory
darkens
not
the
long
summer
days
away
in
the
smooth
flying
dutchman
past
windsor
glorious
towers
and
eton
past
the
little
village
and
churchyard
where
a
century
and
a
half
ago
the
famous
elegy
was
written
and
where
hard
by
those
rugged
elms
that
shade
yet
rests
the
body
of
the
mighty
poet
gray
how
those
lines
run
in
one
head
this
bright
summer
evening
as
from
our
railway
carriage
we
note
the
great
white
dome
of
stoke
house
peeping
out
amid
the
elms
whilst
every
field
reminds
us
of
him
who
wrote
those
lilting
stanzas
long
long
ago
ah
happy
hills
ah
pleasing
shade
ah
fields
beloved
in
vain
where
once
my
careless
childhood
strayed
a
stranger
yet
to
pain
i
feel
the
gales
that
from
ye
blow
a
momentary
bliss
bestow
as
waving
fresh
their
gladsome
wing
my
weary
soul
they
seem
to
soothe
and
redolent
of
joy
and
youth
to
breathe
a
second
spring
but
soon
we
are
flashing
past
reading
where
sutton
nursery
gardens
are
bright
with
scarlet
and
gold
and
blue
and
white
every
flower
that
can
be
made
to
grow
in
our
climate
grows
there
we
may
be
sure
but
there
is
no
need
of
garden
flowers
now
when
the
fields
and
hedges
even
the
railway
banks
are
painted
with
the
lovely
blue
of
wild
geraniums
and
harebells
the
gold
of
birdsfoot
trefoil
and
saint
john
wort
and
the
white
and
pink
of
convolvulus
or
bindweed
we
are
passing
through
some
of
the
richest
scenery
in
the
thames
valley
there
on
the
right
is
mapledurham
a
grand
mediaeval
building
surrounded
by
such
a
wealth
of
stately
trees
as
you
will
see
nowhere
else
the
thames
runs
practically
through
the
grounds
what
a
glorious
carpet
of
gold
is
spread
over
these
meadows
when
the
buttercups
are
in
full
bloom
now
comes
pangbourne
with
its
lovely
weir
where
the
big
thames
trout
love
to
lie
pangbourne
used
to
be
one
of
the
prettiest
villages
on
the
river
but
its
popularity
has
spoilt
it
as
we
pass
onwards
many
other
country
houses
purley
basildon
and
hardwick
with
their
parks
and
clustering
cottages
add
their
charm
to
the
view
there
are
the
beautiful
woods
of
streatley
hanging
copses
clothe
the
sides
of
the
hills
and
pretty
villages
nestle
amid
the
trees
but
soon
the
scene
changes
the
glorious
valley
father
thames
has
scooped
out
for
himself
is
left
behind
we
are
crossing
the
chalk
uplands
on
all
sides
are
vast
stretches
of
unfenced
arable
land
though
here
and
there
a
tiny
village
with
its
norman
church
peeps
out
from
an
oasis
of
green
fields
and
stately
elm
trees
on
the
right
the
chiltern
hills
are
seen
in
the
background
and
wittenham
clump
stands
forth
a
conspicuous
object
for
miles
the
country
round
didcot
reminds
one
very
much
of
the
north
of
france
between
calais
and
paris
one
notices
the
same
chalk
soil
the
same
flat
arable
fields
and
the
same
farmhouses
and
gabled
cottages
but
now
we
have
entered
the
grand
old
berkshire
vale
fields
and
hedges
hedges
and
fields
peace
and
plenty
plenty
and
peace
i
should
like
to
take
a
foreigner
down
the
vale
of
berkshire
in
the
end
of
may
and
ask
him
what
he
thought
of
old
england
thus
wrote
charles
kingsley
forty
years
ago
when
times
were
better
for
berkshire
farmers
but
the
same
old
fields
and
the
same
old
hedges
still
remain
only
we
do
not
appreciate
them
as
much
as
did
the
author
of
westward
ho
steventon
that
lovely
village
with
its
gables
and
thatched
roofs
its
white
cottage
walls
set
with
beams
of
blackest
oak
its
norman
church
in
the
midst
of
spreading
chestnuts
and
leafy
elms
appears
from
the
railway
to
be
one
of
the
most
spots
on
earth
this
vale
is
full
of
fine
old
trees
but
in
many
places
the
farmers
have
spoilt
their
beauty
by
lopping
off
the
lower
branches
because
the
grass
will
not
grow
under
their
foliage
it
is
only
in
the
parks
and
woodlands
that
the
real
glory
of
the
timber
remains
and
now
we
may
notice
what
a
splendid
hunting
country
is
this
berkshire
vale
the
fields
are
large
and
entirely
grass
the
fences
though
strong
are
all
flying
ones
posts
and
rails
too
are
frequent
in
the
hedges
many
a
fine
scamper
have
the
old
berkshire
hounds
enjoyed
over
these
grassy
pastures
where
the
rosy
brook
winds
its
sluggish
course
and
we
trust
they
will
continue
to
do
so
for
many
years
to
come
long
may
that
day
be
in
coming
when
the
sound
of
the
horn
is
no
longer
heard
in
this
delightful
country
high
up
on
the
hill
the
old
white
horse
soon
appears
in
view
cut
in
the
velvety
turf
of
the
rolling
chalk
downs
but
in
the
words
of
the
old
ballad
the
ould
white
horse
wants
zettin
to
rights
he
wants
scouring
badly
a
stranger
if
shown
this
old
relic
the
centre
of
a
hundred
legends
famous
the
whole
world
over
would
find
it
difficult
to
recognise
any
likeness
to
a
fiery
steed
in
those
uncertain
lines
of
chalk
nevertheless
this
is
the
monument
king
alfred
made
to
commemorate
his
victory
over
the
danes
at
ashdown
so
the
tradition
of
the
has
had
it
for
a
thousand
years
and
shall
a
thousand
more
the
horse
is
drawn
as
galloping
frank
buckland
took
the
following
measurements
of
him
the
total
length
is
one
hundred
and
seventy
yards
his
eye
is
four
feet
across
his
ear
fifteen
yards
in
length
his
hindleg
is
yards
long
doubtless
the
full
proportions
of
the
white
horse
are
not
kept
scoured
nowadays
for
a
few
weeks
ago
i
was
up
on
the
hill
and
took
some
of
the
measurements
myself
i
could
not
make
mine
agree
with
frank
buckland
for
instance
the
ear
appeared
to
be
seven
yards
only
in
length
and
not
fifteen
so
that
it
would
seem
that
the
figure
is
gradually
growing
smaller
it
is
the
head
and
forelegs
that
want
scouring
worst
of
all
there
is
little
sign
of
the
trench
two
feet
deep
which
in
buckland
time
formed
the
outline
of
the
horse
the
depth
of
the
cutting
is
now
only
a
matter
of
a
very
few
inches
the
view
from
this
hill
is
a
very
extensive
one
embracing
the
vale
from
bath
almost
to
reading
the
whole
length
of
the
cotswold
hills
as
well
as
the
chilterns
stretching
away
eastwards
towards
aylesbury
and
far
into
buckinghamshire
beneath
your
feet
lie
many
hundred
thousand
acres
of
green
pastures
varied
in
colour
during
summer
and
autumn
by
golden
wheatfields
bright
with
yellow
charlock
and
crimson
poppies
it
has
been
said
that
eleven
counties
are
visible
on
clear
days
the
white
horse
at
westbury
further
down
the
line
represents
a
horse
in
a
standing
position
he
reflects
the
utmost
credit
on
his
grooms
for
not
only
are
his
shapely
limbs
beautifully
and
wonderfully
made
but
the
greatest
care
is
taken
of
him
the
westbury
horse
is
not
in
reality
nearly
so
large
as
this
one
at
uffington
but
he
is
a
very
beautiful
feature
of
the
country
i
paid
him
a
visit
the
other
day
and
was
surprised
to
find
he
was
very
much
smaller
than
he
appears
from
the
railway
glancing
over
a
recent
edition
of
tom
hughes
book
the
scouring
of
the
white
horse
i
found
the
following
lines
in
all
likelihood
the
of
will
be
the
last
of
his
race
for
is
not
the
famous
saxon
or
british
horse
now
scheduled
to
an
act
of
parliament
as
an
ancient
monument
which
will
be
maintained
in
time
to
come
as
a
piece
of
prosaic
business
at
the
cost
of
other
than
berkshire
men
reared
within
sight
of
the
hill
alas
it
is
too
true
there
has
been
no
since
it
would
have
been
a
splendid
way
of
commemorating
the
diamond
jubilee
if
a
scouring
had
been
organised
in
forty
years
have
passed
since
the
last
pastime
with
its
backsword
play
and
climmin
a
greasy
pole
for
a
leg
of
mutton
its
race
for
a
pig
and
a
cheese
and
oddly
enough
the
previous
scouring
had
taken
place
in
the
year
of
the
accession
years
ago
it
would
be
enough
to
make
poor
tom
hughes
turn
in
his
grave
if
he
knew
that
the
old
white
horse
had
been
turned
out
to
grass
and
left
to
look
after
himself
for
the
rest
of
his
days
those
were
grand
old
times
when
the
berkshire
gloucestershire
and
somersetshire
men
amused
themselves
by
cracking
each
other
heads
and
for
a
hat
and
a
pair
of
buckskin
breeches
when
a
flitch
of
bacon
was
run
for
by
donkeys
and
when
last
but
not
least
john
morse
of
uffington
grinned
agin
another
chap
droo
hos
horse
collars
a
fine
bit
of
spwoart
to
be
sure
and
made
the
folks
laaf
i
here
quote
from
tom
hughes
book
the
scouring
of
the
white
horse
to
which
i
must
refer
my
readers
for
further
interesting
particulars
there
are
some
days
during
summer
when
the
sunlight
is
so
beautiful
that
every
object
is
invested
with
a
glamour
and
a
charm
not
usually
associated
with
it
such
a
day
was
that
of
which
we
write
as
we
were
gliding
out
of
swindon
the
sun
was
beginning
to
descend
from
a
great
western
express
running
at
the
rate
of
sixty
miles
an
hour
through
picturesque
country
you
may
watch
the
sun
setting
amidst
every
variety
of
scenery
now
some
hoary
grey
tower
stands
out
against
the
intense
brightness
of
the
western
sky
now
a
tracery
of
fine
trees
shades
for
a
time
the
dazzling
light
then
suddenly
the
fiery
furnace
is
revealed
again
reflected
perhaps
in
the
waters
of
some
stream
or
amid
the
reeds
and
sedges
of
a
mere
where
a
punt
is
moored
containing
anglers
in
broad
wideawake
hats
gradually
a
dark
purple
shade
steals
over
the
long
range
of
chalk
hills
white
roads
stand
out
clearly
defined
miles
away
on
the
horizon
the
smoke
that
rises
straight
up
from
some
homestead
half
a
mile
away
is
bluer
than
the
evening
sky
a
deep
azure
blue
the
horizon
is
clear
in
the
south
but
in
the
dark
but
not
forbidding
clouds
are
rising
fantastic
cloudlets
float
high
up
in
the
firmament
rooks
coming
home
to
roost
are
plainly
visible
several
miles
away
against
the
brilliant
western
sky
this
great
western
railway
runs
through
some
of
the
finest
bits
of
old
england
not
long
ago
in
travelling
from
chepstow
to
gloucester
we
were
fairly
amazed
at
the
surpassing
beauty
of
the
views
it
was
and
the
weather
was
in
keeping
with
the
occasion
the
sight
of
the
old
town
of
chepstow
and
the
silvery
wye
as
we
left
them
behind
us
was
fine
enough
but
who
can
describe
the
magnificent
panorama
presented
by
the
wide
severn
at
low
tide
yellow
sands
glittering
like
gold
in
the
dazzling
sunshine
stretched
away
for
miles
beyond
these
a
vista
of
green
meadows
with
the
distant
cotswold
hills
rising
out
of
dreamy
haze
waters
of
chrysolite
with
fields
of
malachite
beyond
the
azure
sky
overhead
flecked
with
clouds
of
pearl
and
opal
and
all
around
the
pear
orchards
in
full
bloom
while
on
the
subject
of
scenery
may
i
enter
a
protest
against
the
change
the
great
western
railway
has
lately
made
in
the
photographs
which
adorn
their
carriages
they
used
to
be
as
beautiful
as
one
could
wish
lately
however
the
colouring
has
been
lavished
on
them
with
no
sparing
hand
these
are
unnatural
and
impossible
whereas
the
old
permanent
photographs
were
very
beautiful
at
kemble
with
its
old
manor
house
and
cottages
we
say
to
the
vale
of
white
horse
for
we
have
entered
the
cotswolds
stretching
from
broadway
to
bath
and
from
birdlip
to
burford
and
containing
about
three
hundred
square
miles
is
a
vast
tract
of
hill
country
intersected
by
numerous
narrow
valleys
probably
at
one
period
this
district
was
a
rough
uncultivated
moor
it
is
now
cultivated
for
the
most
part
and
grows
excellent
barley
the
highest
point
of
this
extensive
range
is
eleven
hundred
and
feet
but
the
average
altitude
would
not
exceed
half
that
height
almost
every
valley
has
its
little
brook
the
district
is
essentially
a
stone
country
for
all
the
houses
and
most
of
their
roofs
are
built
of
the
local
limestone
which
lies
everywhere
on
these
hills
within
a
few
inches
of
the
surface
there
is
no
difficulty
in
obtaining
plenty
of
stone
hereabouts
the
chief
characteristics
of
the
buildings
are
their
antiquity
and
gothic
quaintness
the
air
is
sharp
and
bracing
and
the
climate
as
is
inevitable
on
the
shallow
porous
soil
of
the
oolite
hills
wonderfully
dry
and
invigorating
lands
of
gold
have
been
found
and
lands
of
spices
and
precious
merchandise
but
this
is
the
land
of
thus
wrote
richard
jefferies
of
the
downs
and
thus
say
we
of
the
cotswolds
and
now
our
great
western
express
is
gliding
into
cirencester
the
ancient
capital
of
the
cotswold
country
how
fair
the
old
place
seems
after
the
dirt
and
smoke
of
london
here
town
and
country
are
blended
into
one
and
everything
is
clean
and
fresh
and
picturesque
the
garish
church
as
you
view
it
from
the
top
of
the
has
a
charm
unsurpassed
by
any
other
sacred
building
in
the
land
in
what
that
charm
lies
i
have
often
wondered
is
it
the
marvellous
symmetry
of
the
whole
graceful
pile
as
the
eye
glancing
down
the
massive
square
tower
and
along
the
pierced
battlements
and
elaborate
pinnacles
finally
rests
on
the
empty
niches
and
traceried
oriel
windows
of
the
magnificent
south
porch
i
can
not
say
in
what
the
charm
exactly
consists
but
this
stately
gothic
fane
has
a
grandeur
as
impressive
as
it
is
unexpected
recalling
those
wondrous
words
of
ruskin
i
used
to
feel
as
much
awe
in
gazing
at
the
buildings
as
on
the
hills
and
could
believe
that
god
had
done
a
greater
work
in
breathing
into
the
narrowness
of
dust
the
mighty
spirits
by
whom
its
haughty
walls
had
been
raised
and
its
burning
legends
written
than
in
lifting
the
rock
of
granite
higher
than
the
clouds
of
heaven
and
veiling
them

their

and

a
cotswold
village
the
village
is
not
a
hundred
miles
from
london
yet
far
from
the
madding
crowd
ignoble
strife
a
green
valley
in
the
midst
of
those
cotswold
hills
it
is
like
an
oasis
in
the
desert
up
above
on
the
wolds
all
is
bleak
dull
and
uninteresting
the
air
up
there
is
ever
chill
walls
of
loose
stone
divide
field
from
field
and
few
houses
are
to
be
seen
but
down
in
the
valley
all
is
fertile
and
full
of
life
it
is
here
that
the
villagers
dwell
how
well
i
remember
the
first
time
i
came
upon
it
one
fine
september
evening
having
left
all
traces
of
railways
and
the
ancient
roman
town
of
cirencester
some
seven
long
miles
behind
me
with
wearied
limbs
i
sought
this
quiet
sequestered
spot
suddenly
as
i
was
wondering
how
amid
these
never
ending
hills
there
could
be
such
a
place
as
i
had
been
told
existed
i
beheld
it
at
my
feet
surpassing
beautiful
below
me
was
a
small
village
nestling
amid
a
wealth
of
stately
trees
the
hand
of
man
seemed
in
some
bygone
time
to
have
done
all
that
was
necessary
to
render
the
place
habitable
but
no
more
there
were
cottages
bridges
and
farm
buildings
but
all
were
ivy
clad
and
time
worn
the
very
trees
themselves
appeared
to
be
laden
with
a
mantle
of
ivy
that
was
more
than
they
could
bear
many
a
tall
fir
from
base
to
topmost
twig
was
completely
robed
with
the
smooth
leaves
of
this
rapacious
evergreen
through
the
thick
foliage
of
elm
and
ash
and
beech
i
could
just
see
an
old
manor
house
and
round
about
it
as
if
for
protection
were
clustered
some
thirty
cottages
a
murmuring
of
waters
filled
my
ears
and
on
descending
the
hill
i
came
upon
a
silvery
trout
stream
which
winds
its
way
down
the
valley
broad
and
shallow
now
gently
gliding
over
smooth
gravel
now
dashing
over
stones
and
rock
the
cottages
like
the
manor
house
and
farm
buildings
are
all
built
of
the
native
stone
and
all
are
gabled
and
picturesque
indeed
save
a
few
new
cottages
most
of
the
dwellings
appeared
to
be
two
or
three
hundred
years
old
one
farmhouse
i
noted
carefully
and
i
longed
to
tear
away
the
ivy
from
the
old
and
crumbling
porch
to
see
if
i
could
not
discern
some
inscription
telling
me
the
date
of
this
relic
of
the
days
of
merrie
england
this
quaint
old
place
appeared
older
than
the
rest
of
the
buildings
on
enquiry
i
learnt
that
long
long
ago
before
the
present
manor
house
existed
this
was
the
abode
of
the
old
squires
of
the
place
but
for
the
last
hundred
years
it
had
been
the
home
of
the
principal
tenant
and
his
ancestors
yeomen
farmers
of
the
school
with
some
six
hundred
acres
of
land
the
present
occupants
appeared
to
be
an
old
man
of
some
seventy
years
of
age
and
his
three
sons
keen
sportsmen
these
who
dearly
love
to
walk
for
hours
in
pursuit
of
game
in
the
autumn
on
the
chance
of
bagging
an
occasional
brace
of
partridges
or
a
wild
pheasant
for
everything
here
is
wild
or
in
winter
when
lake
and
fen
are
frostbound
by
the
river
and
its
withybeds
after
snipe
and
wildfowl
for
the
cotswold
stream
has
never
been
known
to
freeze
in
this
small
hamlet
i
noticed
that
there
were
no
less
than
three
huge
barns
at
first
i
thought
they
were
churches
so
magnificent
were
their
proportions
and
so
delicate
and
interesting
their
architecture
one
of
these
barns
is
four
hundred
years
old
fifty
years
ago
what
with
the
wool
from
his
sheep
and
the
grain
that
was
stored
in
these
barns
year
by
year
the
cotswold
farmer
was
a
rich
man
alas
mutantur
nos
et
mutamur
in
illis
one
can
picture
the
harvest
home
annually
held
in
the
barn
in
old
days
so
cheery
but
now
often
nothing
more
than
a
form
here
however
in
this
village
i
learnt
that
in
spite
of
bad
times
some
of
the
old
customs
have
not
been
allowed
to
pass
away
and
right
merry
is
the
harvest
home
and
christmastide
is
kept
in
real
old
english
fashion
nor
do
the
mummers
forget
to
go
their
nightly
rounds
with
their
strange
tale
of
george
and
the
dragon
as
i
walk
down
the
road
i
come
suddenly
upon
the
manor
house
the
big
house
of
the
village
long
and
somewhat
low
it
stands
close
to
the
road
and
is
of
some
size
over
the
doorway
of
the
porch
is
the
following
inscription
engraven
on
stone
in
a
recess
plead
thou
my
cavse
oh
lord
by
jhon
coxwel
ano
domeny
underneath
this
inscription
and
immediately
over
the
entrance
are
five
heads
elaborately
carved
in
stone
in
the
centre
is
queen
elizabeth
to
the
right
are
portrayed
what
i
take
to
be
the
features
of
henry
viii
whilst
on
the
left
is
mary
the
other
two
are
uncertain
but
they
are
probably
philip
of
spain
and
james
i
was
enchanted
with
the
place
the
quaint
old
elizabethan
gables
and
sombre
the
entrance
gates
the
luxuriant
growth
of
ivy
combined
together
to
give
that
air
of
peace
that
charm
which
belongs
so
exclusively
to
the
buildings
of
the
middle
ages
knowing
that
the
house
was
for
the
time
being
unoccupied
i
walked
boldly
into
the
outer
porch
meaning
to
go
no
further
but
another
inscription
over
the
solid
oak
door
encouraged
me
to
enter
porta
patens
esto
nulli
claudaris
honesto
i
therefore
opened
the
inner
door
with
some
difficulty
for
it
was
heavy
and
cumbersome
and
found
myself
in
the
hall
although
nothing
remarkable
met
my
eye
i
was
delighted
to
find
everything
in
keeping
with
the
place
the
furniture
the
old
oak
the
grim
portraits
and
quaint
heraldry
all
were
there
i
was
much
interested
in
some
carved
beams
of
black
oak
which
i
afterwards
learnt
originally
formed
part
of
the
magnificent
roof
of
the
village
church
when
the
roof
was
under
repair
a
few
years
back
these
beams
were
thrown
aside
as
rotten
and
useless
and
thus
found
their
way
into
the
manor
house
every
atom
of
genuine
old
work
of
this
kind
is
deeply
interesting
representing
as
it
does
the
rude
chiselling
which
hands
that
have
long
been
dust
in
the
village
churchyard
wrought
with
infinite
pains
that
oak
roof
carved
in
rich
tracery
resting
for
ages
on
arcades
of
norman
and
graceful
early
english
work
had
echoed
back
the
songs
of
praise
and
prayer
that
rose
sunday
after
sunday
from
the
lips
of
successive
generations
of
simple
country
folk
at
matins
and
at
evensong
before
the
strains
of
the
angelus
had
been
hushed
for
ever
by
the
reformation
and
who
can
tell
how
long
before
the
conquest
and
by
what
manner
of
men
were
planted
the
trees
destined
to
provide
these
massive
beams
of
oak
in
the
centre
of
the
hall
was
a
round
table
with
very
chairs
scattered
about
of
all
shapes
and
sizes
portraits
of
various
degrees
of
indifferent
oil
painting
adorned
the
walls
of
the
hall
and
staircase
somebody
appeared
to
have
been
shooting
with
a
catapult
at
some
of
the
pictures
one
old
gentleman
had
a
shot
through
his
nose
and
an
old
fellow
with
a
hat
on
over
the
window
had
received
a
pellet
in
the
right
eye
footnote
the
writer
in
a
fit
of
infantile
insanity
being
then
aged
about
nine
was
discovered
in
the
very
act
of
committing
this
assault
on
his
ancestors
some
twenty
years
ago
in
hertfordshire
a
copy
of
the
magna
charta
a
suit
of
mediaeval
armour
several
rusty
helmets
cromwellian
and
otherwise
antlers
of
several
kinds
of
deer
and
a
variety
of
old
swords
pistols
and
guns
were
the
objects
that
chiefly
attracted
my
attention
the
walls
were
likewise
adorned
with
a
large
number
of
heraldic
shields
i
like
to
see
and
escutcheons
hanging
up
in
churches
and
in
the
halls
of
old
country
houses
for
the
following
simple
reasons
there
is
meaning
in
them
deep
mystic
meaning
such
as
no
ordinary
picture
can
boast
every
quartering
on
that
ancient
shield
emblazoned
in
red
black
and
gold
has
a
legend
attached
to
it
hundreds
of
years
ago
in
those
splendid
mediaeval
times
nay
farther
back
than
that
in
the
dim
mysterious
dark
ages
each
of
those
quarterings
was
a
device
worn
by
some
brave
knight
or
squire
on
his
heavy
shield
it
was
his
cognizance
in
the
field
of
battle
and
at
the
tournament
it
was
borne
at
agincourt
perhaps
at
creçy
or
poitiers
or
in
the
lists
for
some
faire
ladye
and
it
is
a
token
of
ancient
chivalry
an
emblem
of
the
days
that
have
been
and
never
more
will
be
it
was
doubtless
the
sight
of
those
eighteen
great
hatchments
which
still
hang
in
the
little
church
at
stoke
poges
that
inspired
gray
to
attune
his
harp
to
such
lofty
strains
the
boast
of
heraldry
the
pomp
of
power
and
all
that
beauty
all
that
wealth
gave
await
alike
the
inevitable
hour
the
paths
of
glory
lead
but
to
the
grave
among
other
old
masters
was
a
portrait
of
the
john
coxwel
who
built
the
house
by
cornelius
jansen
dated
the
house
did
not
appear
remarkable
either
for
size
or
grandeur
yet
there
is
always
something
particularly
pleasing
to
me
to
alight
unexpectedly
on
buildings
of
this
kind
and
to
find
that
although
they
are
obscure
and
unknown
they
are
on
a
small
scale
as
interesting
to
the
antiquarian
as
knole
hatfield
and
other
more
famous
mediaeval
houses
some
lattice
windows
evidently
at
some
time
out
of
doors
but
now
on
the
inner
walls
showed
that
in
more
recent
times
the
house
had
been
enlarged
and
the
old
courtyard
walled
in
and
made
part
of
the
hall
over
one
of
these
windows
is
the
inscription
tenebras
the
part
i
liked
best
however
was
the
passage
with
its
lattice
windows
and
musty
dungeon
savour
leading
to
the
ancient
kitchen
and
to
a
little
but
knocking
my
head
severely
against
the
oak
beam
in
the
doorway
i
nearly
brought
the
whole
ceiling
down
a
catastrophe
which
they
tell
me
has
happened
before
now
in
this
rather
rickety
old
manor
house
opening
a
door
on
the
other
side
of
the
house
i
passed
out
into
the
garden
how
characteristic
of
the
place
a
broad
terrace
running
along
the
whole
length
of
the
house
and
beyond
that
a
few
flower
beds
with
the
old
sundial
in
their
midst
beyond
these
a
lawn
and
then
grass
sweeping
down
to
the
edge
of
the
river
some
hundred
yards
away
beyond
the
river
again
more
grass
but
of
a
wilder
description
where
the
rabbits
are
scudding
about
or
listening
with
pricked
ears
and
in
the
background
a
magnificent
hanging
wood
crowning
the
side
of
the
valley
with
a
large
rookery
in
it
i
was
much
struck
with
the
different
tints
of
the
foliage
for
although
autumn
had
not
yet
begun
to
turn
the
leaves
the
different
shades
of
green
were
most
striking
a
gigantic
ash
tree
on
the
far
side
of
the
river
stood
out
in
bold
relief
its
lighter
leaves
being
in
striking
contrast
to
the
dark
firs
in
the
background
then
walnut
and
hazel
beech
and
chestnut
all
offered
infinite
variety
of
shape
and
foliage
the
river
here
had
been
broadened
to
a
width
of
some
ninety
feet
and
an
island
had
been
made
the
place
seemed
to
be
a
veritable
sportsman
paradise
dearly
would
isaac
walton
have
loved
to
dwell
here
from
the
windows
of
the
old
house
he
would
have
loved
to
listen
to
the
splash
of
the
trout
the
cawing
of
the
rooks
and
the
quack
of
the
waterfowl
while
all
the
air
is
filled
with
the
cooing
of
doves
and
the
songs
of
birds
at
night
he
could
have
heard
the
murmuring
waterfall
amid
a
stillness
only
broken
at
intervals
by
the
scream
of
the
owl
the
clatter
of
the
goatsucker
or
the
weird
barking
of
the
foxes
for
not
two
hundred
yards
from
the
house
and
practically
in
the
garden
is
a
fox
earth
that
has
never
been
without
a
litter
of
cubs
for
forty
years
in
an
house
in
the
i
saw
a
very
large
number
of
foxes
noses
nailed
to
boards
of
wood
as
sir
roger
de
coverley
used
to
nail
them
they
appeared
to
have
been
slain
by
one
dick
turpin
huntsman
to
the
vale
of
white
horse
hounds
some
thirty
or
forty
years
ago
when
a
quondam
master
of
those
hounds
lived
in
this
old
place
what
a
charm
there
is
in
an
english
garden
the
great
tall
hollyhocks
and
phlox
the
bright
orange
marigolds
and
large
purple
poppies
the
beds
and
borders
crammed
with
cloves
and
asters
the
sweet
blue
of
the
cornflower
and
the
little
lobelias
zinneas
too
of
all
colours
dahlias
tall
stalks
of
anenome
japonica
and
such
tangled
masses
of
stocks
as
i
walked
down
by
the
old
garden
wall
whereon
lots
of
roses
hung
their
dainty
heads
i
thought
i
had
never
seen
grass
so
green
and
fresh
looking
except
in
certain
parts
of
ireland
but
the
wild
flowers
by
the
silent
river
pleased
me
best
of
all
such
a
medley
of
graceful
fragrant
and
tall
with
their
lovely
pink
flowers
light
blue
and
were
there
too
not
only
among
the
and
the
tall
by
the
bank
but
little
islands
of
them
dotted
about
a
over
the
brook
with
spikes
and
downy
stalks
was
almost
lost
amongst
the
taller
wild
flowers
and
the
segs
that
fringed
the
there
are
no
flowers
like
the
wild
ones
they
last
right
through
the
summer
and
autumn
yet
we
can
never
have
enough
of
them
never
cease
wondering
at
their
marvellous
delicacy
and
beauty
darting
straight
up
stream
on
the
wings
of
the
soft
south
wind
comes
a
kingfisher
clothed
in
priceless
jewelry
sparkling
in
the
sun
sapphire
and
amethyst
on
his
bright
blue
back
rubies
on
his
ruddy
breast
and
diamonds
round
his
princely
neck
monarch
he
is
of
silvery
stream
and
petty
tyrant
of
the
silvery
fish
i
was
told
by
a
labourer
that
the
trout
ran
from
a
quarter
of
a
pound
to
three
pounds
and
that
they
average
one
pound
in
weight
that
in
the
season
a
score
of
fish
are
often
taken
in
the
day
by
one
rod
and
that
the
method
of
taking
them
is
by
the
artificial
fly
well
dried
and
deftly
floated
over
feeding
fish
these
cotswold
streams
are
fed
at
intervals
of
about
half
a
mile
by
the
most
beautiful
springs
and
from
the
rock
comes
pouring
forth
an
everlasting
supply
of
the
purest
and
clearest
of
water
i
was
shown
such
a
spring
in
a
withybed
hard
by
the
old
manor
house
i
saw
nothing
at
first
but
a
still
transparent
pool
nine
feet
deep
they
told
me
it
looked
but
three
but
as
i
gaze
at
the
beautiful
fernlike
weeds
at
the
bottom
they
are
seen
to
be
gently
fanned
by
the
water
that
rises
never
failing
even
in
the
hottest
and
driest
of
summers
from
the
invisible
rock
below
the
whole
scene
the
silent
pool
at
my
feet
the
rich
valley
with
its
marked
contrast
to
the
cold
hills
that
overlook
it
reminded
me
forcibly
of
lines
at
the
conclusion
of
the
most
impressive
poem
he
ever
wrote
the
fairies
spring
and
sweet
to
the
thirsting
lips
of
men
is
the
spring
of
tears
in
the
fairies
glen
out
of
this
fairy
spring
was
taken
quite
recently
but
not
with
the
dry
fly
for
no
fish
could
be
deceived
in
water
of
such
stainless
transparency
a
trout
that
weighed
three
pounds
and
a
half
he
was
far
and
away
the
most
beautiful
trout
we
ever
saw
as
silvery
as
a
salmon
that
has
just
left
the
sea
he
was
a
worthy
denizen
of
the
secluded
depths
of
that
crystal
spring
still
welling
up
from
the
pure
limestone
rock
in
the
heart
of
the
cotswold
hills
as
it
has
for
a
thousand
years
i
was
told
that
the
place
was
still
owned
by
the
descendants
of
the
pious
john
coxwell
who
built
the
manor
house
and
commemorated
it
by
the
quaint
inscription
over
the
porch
in
doubtless
the
architecture
of
all
our
elizabethan
manor
houses
in
the
shape
of
a
letter
e
owes
its
origin
to
the
first
letter
in
the
name
of
that
great
queen
that
year
was
a
fitting
time
for
the
building
of
those
haunts
of
ancient
peace
that
have
ever
since
beautified
the
villages
of
rural
england
not
two
years
before
men
minds
had
been
stirred
to
a
pitch
of
deep
religious
enthusiasm
by
what
was
then
regarded
throughout
all
england
as
a
divine
miracle
the
destruction
of
the
spanish
armada
scarce
three
years
had
passed
since
the
war
with
scotland
had
terminated
in
the
execution
of
the
mary
queen
of
scots
it
is
difficult
for
us
at
the
close
of
this
nineteenth
century
to
realise
the
feelings
of
our
ancestors
in
those
times
of
daily
terror
and
anxiety
and
when
men
were
daily
executed
and
human
life
was
held
as
cheap
as
we
now
value
a
sheep
or
an
ox
no
wonder
john
coxwell
was
pious
and
no
wonder
he
engraved
that
pious
inscription
over
those
crumbling
walls
in
the
year
there
was
a
lull
in
those
tempestuous
times
and
men
were
able
to
turn
for
a
while
from
the
strife
of
battle
and
the
daily
fear
of
death
and
cultivate
the
arts
of
peace
thus
this
stately
little
manor
house
was
reared
and
many
like
it
throughout
the
kingdom
and
there
it
still
stands
and
will
stand
long
after
the
modern
building
has
fallen
to
the
ground
for
not
without
much
hard
toil
and
sweat
of
brow
did
our
forefathers
erect
these
monuments
of
a
day
that
is
dead
and
they
remain
to
testify
to
the
solid
masonry
and
laborious
workmanship
of
ancient
times
the
descendants
of
this
john
coxwell
live
on
another
property
of
theirs
some
twelve
miles
away
it
is
nearly
seventy
years
since
they
have
inhabited
this
old
house
i
was
pleased
to
find
however
that
the
present
occupiers
look
after
the
labouring
classes
that
what
rabbits
are
killed
on
the
manor
are
not
sold
but
distributed
in
the
village
there
is
an
old
building
in
the
grounds
only
a
few
paces
from
the
manor
house
this
is
the
village
club
here
squire
farmer
and
labourer
are
accustomed
to
meet
on
equal
terms
i
was
somewhat
surprised
to
see
on
the
club
table
the
the
mall
and
other
papers
these
wonderful
specimens
of
literature
contrast
strangely
with
a
place
that
in
many
respects
has
remained
unchanged
for
centuries
there
are
few
labourers
in
england
even
in
these
days
who
have
the
opportunity
if
they
will
take
it
of
reading
the
report
of
every
speech
made
in
parliament
perhaps
some
day
will
come
forth
from
this
hamlet
some
village
hampden
that
with
dauntless
breast
the
little
tyrant
of
his
fields
withstood
one
who
from
earliest
youth
has
kept
himself
in
touch
with
the
politics
of
the
day
and
has
fitted
himself
to
sit
in
the
house
of
commons
as
the
representative
of
his
class
there
are
still
a
few
little
tyrants
in
the
fields
in
all
parts
of
england
but
they
are
very
much
scarcer
than
was
the
case
fifty
years
ago
i
was
much
pleased
with
a
conversation
i
had
with
an
labouring
man
who
though
not
past
middle
age
appeared
to
be
incapacitated
from
work
owing
to
a
game
leg
and
whom
i
found
sitting
under
a
walnut
tree
in
the
manor
grounds
hard
by
the
brook
he
informed
me
that
there
was
bagatelle
at
the
club
for
those
who
liked
it
and
all
sorts
of
games
and
smoking
concerts
that
it
was
a
question
who
was
the
best
bagatelle
player
in
the
club
but
that
it
probably
lay
between
the
squire
and
his
head
gardener
though
tom
the
carter
was
likely
to
run
them
close
i
was
glad
to
find
so
much
good
feeling
existing
among
all
classes
of
this
little
community
and
was
not
surprised
to
learn
that
this
was
a
contented
and
happy
village
in
this
description
of
a
cotswold
village
we
have
been
looking
on
the
bright
side
of
things
and
there
is
thank
heaven
many
a
place
that
would
answer
to
it
alas
that
there
should
be
another
side
to
the
picture
which
we
would
fain
leave
untouched
gloucestershire
nay
england
is
full
of
old
manor
houses
and
fair
smiling
villages
but
in
many
parts
of
the
country
we
see
buildings
falling
out
of
repair
and
deserted
mansions
would
that
we
knew
the
remedy
for
agricultural
depression
but
let
us
not
despair
the
future
hides
in
it
gladness
and
sorrow
we
press
still
thorow
nought
that
abides
in
it
daunting
us
onward
it
is
a
sad
thing
when
the
big
house
of
the
village
is
empty
the
labourers
who
never
see
their
squire
begin
to
look
upon
him
as
a
sort
of
ogre
who
exists
merely
to
screw
rents
out
of
the
land
they
till
those
who
are
dependent
on
land
alone
are
often
the
men
who
do
their
duty
best
on
their
estates
and
poor
though
they
may
be
they
are
much
beloved
but
it
is
to
be
feared
that
in
some
parts
of
england
men
who
are
not
suffering
from
the
depression
rich
tenants
of
country
houses
and
the
like
are
apt
to
take
a
somewhat
limited
view
of
their
duty
towards
their
poorer
neighbours
to
be
sure
the
good
ladies
at
the
great
house
are
invariably
ministering
angels
to
the
poor
in
time
of
sickness
but
even
in
these
democratic
days
there
is
too
great
a
gulf
fixed
between
all
classes
let
all
those
who
are
fortunate
enough
to
live
in
such
a
place
as
we
have
attempted
to
describe
remember
that
a
kind
word
a
shake
of
the
hand
the
occasional
distribution
of
game
throughout
the
village
and
a
hundred
other
small
kindnesses
do
more
to
win
the
heart
of
the
labouring
man
than
much
talk
at
election
times
of
small
holdings
parish
councils
or
free
education
a
tea
given
two
or
three
times
a
year
by
the
squire
to
the
whole
village
when
the
grounds
are
thrown
open
to
them
does
much
to
lighten
the
dulness
of
their
existence
and
to
cheer
the
monotonous
round
of
daily
toil
it
is
often
thoughtlessness
rather
than
poverty
that
prevents
those
who
live
in
the
large
house
of
the
village
from
being
really
loved
by
those
around
them
there
are
many
instances
of
unpopular
squires
whose
faces
the
cottagers
never
behold
and
yet
these
men
may
be
spending
hundreds
of
pounds
each
year
for
the
benefit
of
those
whose
affection
they
fail
to
gain
alas
that
there
should
exist
in
so
many
country
places
that
class
feeling
that
is
called
radicalism
it
is
perhaps
fortunate
that
under
the
guise
of
politics
what
is
really
nothing
else
but
bitterness
and
discontent
is
hidden
and
prevented
from
being
recognised
by
its
true
name
there
are
many
country
houses
that
are
shut
up
for
the
greater
part
of
the
year
for
other
reasons
than
agricultural
depression
often
because
the
owner
while
preferring
to
reside
elsewhere
is
too
proud
to
let
the
place
to
a
stranger
this
should
not
be
let
these
rich
men
who
own
large
houses
and
great
estates
live
those
houses
and
those
estates
or
endeavour
to
find
a
tenant
we
repeat
that
the
landowners
who
really
feel
the
stress
of
bad
times
for
the
most
part
do
their
duty
nobly
they
have
learnt
it
in
the
severe
school
of
adversity
it
is
the
richer
class
that
we
should
like
to
see
taking
a
greater
interest
in
their
humble
neighbours
and
their
power
is
great
the
possessor
of
wealth
is
too
often
the
tacit
upholder
of
the
doctrine
of
the
times
we
live
in
will
no
longer
allow
it
let
us
be
up
and
doing
in
many
small
ways
we
may
do
much
to
promote
good
fellowship
and
bitterness
and
discontent
shall
be
no
longer
known
in
the
rural
villages
of
england
ii
in
the
dead
of
winter
these
old
grey
houses
of
the
cotswolds
are
a
little
melancholy
save
when
the
sun
shines
but
to
every
variety
of
scenery
winter
is
the
least
becoming
season
of
the
year
though
the
hoar
frost
or
a
touch
of
snow
will
transform
a
whole
village
into
fairyland
at
a
moment
notice
then
the
trout
stream
which
at
other
seasons
of
the
year
is
a
never
failing
attraction
running
as
it
does
for
the
most
part
through
the
woods
in
mid
winter
seldom
reflects
the
light
of
the
sun
and
looks
cold
and
uninviting
one
may
learn
much
it
is
true
of
the
wonders
of
nature
in
the
dead
time
of
the
year
by
watching
the
great
trout
on
the
spawn
beds
as
they
pile
up
the
gravel
day
by
day
and
store
up
beautiful
transparent
ova
of
which
but
a
part
will
live
to
replenish
the
stock
for
future
years
but
the
delight
of
a
clear
stream
is
found
in
the
spring
and
summer
then
those
cool
shaded
deeps
and
sparkling
eddies
please
us
by
their
contrast
to
the
hot
burning
sun
and
we
love
even
if
we
are
not
fishermen
to
linger
by
the
bank
the
shade
of
ash
and
beech
and
alder
and
watch
the
wonderful
life
around
us
in
the
water
and
in
the
air
as
you
sit
sometimes
on
a
bench
hard
by
the
coln
watching
the
crystal
water
as
it
pours
down
the
artificial
fall
from
the
miniature
lake
in
the
wild
garden
above
you
may
make
a
minute
calculation
of
the
day
and
hour
that
that
very
water
which
is
flowing
past
you
now
will
reach
london
bridge
two
hundred
miles
below
allowing
one
mile
an
hour
as
the
average
pace
of
the
current
ten
days
is
roughly
speaking
the
time
it
will
take
on
its
journey
and
when
one
reflects
that
every
drop
that
passes
has
its
work
to
do
in
carrying
down
to
the
sea
lime
and
i
know
not
how
many
other
ingredients
and
in
depositing
that
lime
and
all
that
it
picked
up
on
its
way
at
the
bottom
of
the
ocean
to
help
perhaps
in
forming
the
great
rolling
downs
of
a
new
continent
after
this
island
of
ours
has
ceased
to
be
one
can
not
but
realise
that
in
all
seasons
of
the
year
a
trout
stream
is
a
wonderfully
interesting
and
instructive
thing
to
the
coln
flow
on
clear
fresh
trout
stream
emblem
of
purity
and
perfect
truth
thou
hast
accomplished
a
mighty
work
thou
hast
a
mighty
work
to
do
who
can
count
the
millions
of
tons
of
lime
that
thou
hast
borne
down
to
the
sea
in
kent
thou
hast
indeed
strength
to
remove
mountains
for
day
by
day
the
soil
that
thou
hast
taken
from
these
limestone
hills
is
being
piled
up
at
the
mouth
of
the
great
historic
river
and
some
day
perchance
it
shall
become
rolling
downs
again
fed
by
clear
springs
thou
shalt
gradually
steal
thy
way
along
the
cotswold
valleys
draining
foul
marshes
irrigating
the
sweet
meadows
thou
shalt
turn
the
wheels
and
grind
many
a
hundred
sacks
of
corn
ere
sun
is
set
and
then
thou
shalt
change
thy
name
no
longer
silvery
coln
but
mighty
thames
shalt
thou
be
called
and
many
a
fair
scene
shall
gladden
thy
sight
as
thou
slowly
passest
along
towards
thy
goal
smiling
meadows
and
gloucestershire
vales
will
soon
give
place
to
fair
berkshire
villages
and
further
on
to
those
glorious
spires
and
courts
of
oxford
and
here
shalt
thou
make
many
friends
friends
who
will
evermore
think
kindly
of
thee
ever
associate
thy
placid
waters
with
all
that
they
loved
best
and
held
dearest
during
their
brief
sojourning
in
those
old
walls
which
tower
above
thy
banks
a
few
short
miles
and
thou
shalt
pass
a
quiet
and
sacred
spot
sacred
to
me
and
dear
above
all
other
spots
for
close
to
that
little
village
church
of
clifton
hampden
and
close
to
thee
we
laid
some
years
ago
the
mortal
body
of
a
noble
man
and
when
thou
stealest
gently
by
and
night
mists
rise
from
off
thy
glassy
face
be
sure
and
drop
a
tear
in
silvery
dew
upon
the
stone
i
know
so
well
and
then
pass
on
to
eton
fairest
spot
on
earth
mark
well
the
the
glorious
trees
and
windsor
towering
high
here
shalt
thou
be
loved
by
many
a
generous
heart
and
youth
and
hope
and
smiling
faces
greet
thee
as
they
long
since
greeted
me
ah
well
those
friendships
never
could
have
been
made
so
firm
and
lasting
mid
any
other
scenes
save
under
thy
elms
beloved
eton
but
onwards
onwards
thou
must
glide
from
scenes
of
tranquil
beauty
such
as
these
the
flag
which
sails
windsor
stately
towers
must
soon
be
lost
to
sight
thy
course
once
more
through
silent
fields
is
laid
but
not
for
long
for
hampton
court
fair
palace
passed
already
canst
thou
hear
the
wondrous
roar
of
unceasing
footsteps
in
the
busy
haunts
of
men
courage
thy
goal
is
nearly
reached
already
thou
art
great
and
greater
still
shalt
thou
become
thy
once
transparent
waters
shall
be
merged
with
salt
thus
shalt
thou
be
given
strength
to
bear
great
ships
upon
thy
bosom
and
thine
eyes
shall
behold
the
greatest
city
of
the
whole
wide
world
nay
more
thou
shalt
become
the
most
indispensable
part
of
that
city
its
very
of
a
value
not
to
be
measured
by
gold
thou
makest
england
what
it
is
flow
on
historic
waters
symbolic
of
all
that
is
good
all
that
is
great
flow
on
and
do
thy
glorious
work
until
this
world
shall
cease
bearing
thy
mighty
burden
down
towards
the
sea
showing
mankind
what
can
be
wrought
from
small
beginnings
by
slow
and
patient
labour
day
by
day
even
in
winter
i
do
not
know
any
scene
more
pleasing
to
the
eye
than
the
sight
of
a
cotswold
hamlet
nestling
amid
the
stately
trees
in
the
valley
if
you
happen
to
see
it
on
a
fine
day
and
if
there
has
been
a
period
of
rainy
sunless
weather
for
a
month
past
you
are
probably
all
the
more
ready
to
appreciate
the
changed
appearance
which
everything
wears
if
that
peaceful
bright
aspect
had
been
habitual
you
would
never
have
noticed
anything
remarkable
it
is
this
very
changeful
nature
of
our
english
climate
which
gives
it
more
than
half
its
charm
but
the
great
attraction
of
this
country
lies
in
its
being
one
of
the
few
spots
now
remaining
on
earth
which
have
not
only
been
made
beautiful
by
god
but
in
which
the
hand
of
man
has
erected
scarcely
a
building
which
is
not
in
strict
conformity
and
good
taste
one
can
not
walk
through
these
cotswold
hamlets
without
noticing
that
the
architecture
of
the
country
in
past
ages
as
well
as
in
the
present
day
to
a
certain
degree
shows
obedience
to
some
of
those
divine
laws
which
ruskin
has
told
us
ought
to
govern
all
the
works
of
man
hand
the
spirit
of
sacrifice
the
lamp
of
truth
are
manifest
in
the
ancient
churches
and
manor
houses
as
well
as
in
the
humble
farmhouses
cottages
and
even
the
tithe
barns
of
this
district
two
thirds
of
the
buildings
are
old
and
as
ruskin
has
beautifully
expressed
it
the
greatest
glory
of
a
building
is
not
in
its
stones
nor
in
its
gold
its
glory
is
in
its
age
and
in
that
deep
sense
of
voicefulness
of
stern
watching
of
mysterious
sympathy
nay
even
of
approval
or
condemnation
which
we
feel
in
walls
that
have
long
been
washed
by
the
passing
waves
of
humanity
it
is
in
their
lasting
witness
against
men
in
their
quiet
contrast
with
the
transitional
character
of
all
things
in
the
strength
which
through
the
lapse
of
seasons
and
times
and
the
decline
and
birth
of
dynasties
and
the
changing
of
the
face
of
the
earth
and
of
the
limits
of
the
sea
maintains
its
sculptured
shapeliness
for
a
time
insuperable
connects
forgotten
and
following
ages
with
each
other
and
half
constitutes
the
identity
as
it
concentrates
the
sympathy
of
nations
it
is
in
that
golden
stain
of
time
that
we
are
to
look
for
the
real
light
and
colour
and
preciousness
of
architecture
and
it
is
not
until
a
building
has
assumed
this
character
till
it
has
been
entrusted
with
the
fame
and
hallowed
by
the
deeds
of
men
till
its
walls
have
been
witnesses
of
suffering
and
its
pillars
rise
out
of
the
shadow
of
death
that
its
existence
more
lasting
as
it
is
than
that
of
the
natural
objects
of
the
world
around
it
can
be
gifted
with
even
so
much
as
these
possess
of
language
and
of
life
if
we
would
seek
a
lesson
in
sacrifice
from
the
men
who
lived
and
laboured
here
in
the
remote
past
we
can
learn
many
a
one
from
those
deep
walls
of
native
stone
and
that
laborious
workmanship
which
was
the
chief
characteristic
of
the
toil
of
our
simple
ancestors
all
old
work
nearly
has
been
hard
work
it
may
be
the
hard
work
of
children
of
barbarians
of
rustics
but
it
is
always
their
utmost
they
may
have
been
ignorant
of
the
sanitary
laws
which
govern
health
and
ill
advised
in
some
of
the
sites
they
chose
but
they
grudged
neither
hand
labour
nor
sweat
of
brow
they
spent
the
best
years
of
their
lives
in
the
erection
of
the
temples
where
we
still
worship
and
the
manor
houses
we
still
inhabit
it
is
not
claimed
that
there
is
much
architecture
to
be
found
in
these
cotswold
buildings
it
is
something
in
these
days
if
we
can
boast
that
there
is
nothing
to
offend
the
eye
in
a
district
which
is
less
than
a
hundred
miles
from
london
there
is
no
other
district
of
equal
extent
within
the
same
radius
of
which
as
much
could
be
said
jam
pauca
aratro
jugera
regiae
moles
relinquent
but
here
all
the
houses
are
picturesque
great
and
small
alike
and
there
are
here
and
there
pieces
of
work
which
testify
to
the
piety
and
faith
of
very
early
days
fragments
of
inscriptions
chiselled
out
more
than
fifteen
hundred
years
ago
such
as
the
four
stones
at
chedworth
discovered
some
thirty
years
ago
together
with
many
other
interesting
relics
of
the
roman
occupation
by
a
gamekeeper
in
search
of
a
ferret
on
these
stones
were
found
the
greek
letters
greek
ch
and
greek
r
forming
the
sacred
monogram
fifteen
hundred
years
had
not
obliterated
this
simple
evidence
of
ancient
faith
nor
had
the
devastation
of
the
ages
impaired
the
beauty
of
design
nor
marred
the
harmony
of
colouring
of
those
delicate
pavements
and
tesserae
with
which
these
wonderful
people
loved
to
adorn
their
habitations
since
this
strange
discovery
the
diligent
research
of
one
man
has
rescued
from
oblivion
and
the
liberality
of
another
now
protects
from
further
injury
one
of
the
best
specimens
of
a
roman
country
house
to
be
found
in
england
far
away
from
the
haunts
of
men
in
the
depths
of
the
chedworth
woods
where
no
sound
save
the
ripple
of
the
coln
and
the
song
of
birds
is
heard
rude
buildings
and
a
museum
have
been
erected
here
these
ancient
relics
are
sheltered
from
wind
and
storm
for
the
sake
of
those
who
lived
and
laboured
in
the
remote
past
and
for
the
benefit
and
instruction
of
him
be
he
casual
or
pilgrim
from
afar
who
cares
to
inspect
them
the
ancient
roman
town
of
cirencester
too
affords
many
historical
remains
of
the
same
era
but
it
is
to
the
part
which
english
hands
and
hearts
have
played
towards
beautifying
the
cotswold
district
that
i
would
fain
direct
attention
to
the
stately
abbey
church
of
cirencester
and
its
glorious
south
porch
with
its
rich
groining
within
and
its
pierced
battlements
and
pinnacles
without
to
the
arched
gateway
of
twelfth
century
work
the
sole
remnant
of
that
once
famous
monastery
the
mitred
abbey
of
mary
founded
by
the
piety
of
the
first
henry
and
overthrown
by
the
barbarity
of
the
last
king
of
that
name
who
ordained
that
all
the
edifices
within
the
site
and
precincts
of
the
monastery
should
be
pulled
down
and
carried
away
it
is
to
the
glorious
windows
of
fairford
church
the
most
beautiful
specimens
remaining
to
us
of
glass
of
the
early
part
of
the
sixteenth
century
and
to
many
an
ancient
church
and
mediaeval
manor
house
still
standing
throughout
this
wide
district
to
point
a
moral
of
adorn
a
tale
that
we
must
look
for
traces
of
the
exquisite
workmanship
of
english
hands
in
bygone
days
the
only
witnesses
perhaps
that
remain
to
us
of
the
faith
and
fear
of
nations
all
else
for
which
the
builders
sacrificed
has
passed
away
all
their
living
interests
and
aims
and
achievements
we
know
not
for
what
they
laboured
and
we
see
no
evidence
of
their
reward
victory
wealth
authority
happiness
all
have
departed
though
bought
by
many
a
bitter
sacrifice
but
of
them
and
their
life
and
their
toil
upon
earth
one
reward
one
evidence
is
left
to
us
in
those
grey
heaps
of
stone
they
have
taken
with
them
to
the
grave
their
powers
their
honours
and
their
errors
but
they
have
left
us
their
adoration

so
it
is
with
all
the

the

may

many
villages
throughout
the
cotswolds
are
to
be

ancient

of
exquisite
workmanship
and

these
were
for
the
most
part
erected
in

of

wayside
cross
of
beautiful
gothic
workmanship
erected
men
say
by
the

of

there
are
ancient
crosses
or
remnants
of
them
at
cirencester
eastleach
harnhill

and
many
other
places
in
the
district
but
few
of
these
old
village
crosses
still
stand
intact
in
their
pristine
beauty
may
they
never
suffer
the
terrible
fate
of
a
very
beautiful
one
which
was
erected
in
the
fourteenth
century
at
bristol
pope
writing
a
century
and
a
half
ago
describes
it
as
a
very
fine
old
cross
of
gothic
curious
work
but
spoiled
with
the
folly
of
gilding
that
takes
away
all
the
venerable
antiquity
happily
there
is
no
likelihood
of
the
ancient
crosses
in
the
cotswolds
being
decorated
by
a
coating
of
gold
the
precious
metal
is
all
too
scarce
there
even
if
the
good
taste
of
the
country
folk
did
not
prohibit
it
i
have
spoken
before
of
the
ancient
barns
every
hamlet
has
one
or
more
of
these
grand
old
edifices
and
there
are
often
as
many
as
three
or
four
in
a
small
village
in
some
of
these
large
barns
the
tithe
was
gathered
together
in
kind
until
rather
more
than
sixty
years
ago
it
was
converted
into
a
rent
charge
was
made
on
all
kinds
of
farm
produce
the
vicar
man
went
into
the
cornfields
and
placed
a
bough
in
every
tenth
stook
then
the
titheman
came
with
the
parson
horses
and
took
the
stuff
away
to
the
barn
the
tithe
for
every
cock
in
the
farmyard
was
three
eggs
for
every
hen
two
eggs
besides
poultry
geese
pigs
and
sheep
the
parson
had
a
right
to
his
share
of
the
milk
and
even
of
the
cheeses
that
were
made
in
his
parish
in
an
ancient
manuscript
which
the
vicar
of
bibury
lately
acquired
and
which
contains
the
history
of
his
parish
since
the
conquest
are
set
down
some
interesting
and
amusing
details
concerning
tithe
and
the
cash
compensations
that
had
been
paid
time
out
of
mind
the
entries
form
part
of
a
diary
kept
by
a
former
incumbent
and
were
made
nearly
two
hundred
years
ago
for
every
new
milch
cow
three
pence
for
every
thorough
milch
cow
one
penny
nothing
is
paid
for
a
dry
cow
and
therefore
tithe
in
kind
must
be
paid
for
all
fatting
cattle
for
every
calf
weaned
a
half
penny
for
every
calf
sold
four
pence
or
left
for
every
calf
killed
in
the
family
four
pence
or
left
i
have
heard
that
one
or
two
left
shoulders
of
veal
were
paid
to
the
widow
hignall
at
arlington
when
she
rented
the
tithes
of
vannam
but
have
received
then
follows
an
annual
account
of
the
value
of
the
tithes
of
the
parish
about
five
thousand
acres
from
to
by
which
it
appears
that
the
year
was
the
best
during
these
four
decades
here
is
the
entry
the
crops
of
this
year
were
very
deficient
but
corn
of
all
sort
sold
at
an
extraordinary
high
price
i
made
of
my
tithes
and
living
this
year
clear
from
the
dearness
of
labourers
the
outgoing
expenses
amounted
to
in
addition
the
worst
year
seems
to
have
been
when
the
parson
only
got
clear
of
all
expenses
but
even
this
was
not
bad
for
those
days
the
architecture
of
the
cotswold
barns
is
often
very
beautiful
the
pointed
windows
massive
buttresses
and
elaborate
pinnacles
are
sufficient
indications
of
their
great
age
and
the
care
bestowed
on
the
building
some
of
the
interiors
of
these
gothic
structures
have
fine
old
oak
roofs
the
cottages
too
though
in
a
few
instances
sadly
deficient
in
sanitary
improvements
and
internal
comfort
are
not
only
picturesque
but
strong
and
lasting
many
of
them
bear
dates
varying
from
to
it
is
evident
that
in
everything
they
did
our
ancestors
who
lived
in
the
elizabethan
age
fully
realised
that
they
were
working
under
the
eye
of
a
great
taskmaster
this
spirit
was
the
making
of
the
great
men
of
that
day
and
in
great
part
laid
the
foundation
of
our
national
greatness
the
glorious
churches
of
cirencester
northleach
burford
and
bibury
and
the
ancient
manor
houses
scattered
throughout
the
cotswolds
are
fitting
monuments
to
the
men
who
laboured
to
erect
them
would
that
space
allowed
a
detailed
account
of
all
these
old
manor
houses
enough
has
been
said
at
all
events
to
show
that
there
are
places
little
known
and
little
cared
for
in
england
where
you
may
still
dwell
without
every
time
you
go
out
of
doors
being
forcibly
reminded
of
the
utilitarian
spirit
of
the

but
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
our
little
hamlet
has
a
more
varied
assortment
of
oddities
than
is
usually
to
be
met
with
in
so
small
a
place
first
of
all
there
is
the
man
whom
nobody
ever
sees
although
he
has
lived
in
robust
health
for
the
past
twenty
years
in
the
very
centre
of
the
hamlet
his
face
is
unknown
to
half
the
inhabitants
twice
only
has
the
writer
set
eyes
on
him
when
a
political
contest
is
proceeding
he
becomes
comparatively
bold
at
such
times
he
has
even
been
met
with
in
the
bar
of
the
village
public
where
he
has
been
known
to
sit
discussing
the
chances
of
the
candidates
like
any
ordinary
being
but
an
election
is
absolutely
necessary
if
this
strange
individual
is
to
be
drawn
out
of
his
the
only
other
occasion
on
which
we
have
set
eyes
on
him
was
on
a
lovely
summer
evening
just
after
sunset
we
observed
him
peeping
at
us
over
a
hedge
for
all
the
world
like
the
spectator
when
he
was
staying
with
sir
roger
de
coverley
he
is
supposed
to
come
out
at
sunset
like
the
foxes
and
the
bats
and
has
been
seen
in
the
distance
on
bright
moonlight
nights
striding
over
the
cotswold
uplands
if
any
one
approach
him
he
hurries
away
in
the
opposite
direction
yet
he
is
not
queer
in
the
head
but
strong
and
in
the
prime
of
life
then
there
is
that
very
common
character
the
village
impostor
after
having
been
turned
away
by
half
a
dozen
different
farmers
because
he
never
did
a
stroke
of
work
he
manages
to
get
on
the
at
the
great
house
long
after
his
ailment
has
been
cured
he
will
be
seen
daily
going
up
to
the
manor
house
for
his
allowance
of
meat
somehow
or
other
he
ca
get
a
job
nohow
the
fact
is
he
has
got
the
name
of
being
an
idle
scoundrel
and
no
farmer
will
take
him
on
it
is
some
time
before
you
are
able
to
find
him
out
for
as
he
goes
decidedly
lame
as
he
passes
you
in
the
village
street
he
generally
manages
to
persuade
you
that
he
is
very
like
a
fool
you
take
compassion
on
him
and
give
him
an
ounce
of
baccy
and
half
a
crown
for
some
months
he
hangs
about
where
he
thinks
you
will
be
passing
craving
a
pipe
of
tobacco
until
one
day
when
you
are
having
a
talk
with
some
other
honest
toiler
he
will
give
you
a
hint
that
you
are
being
imposed
on
when
a
loafer
of
this
sort
finds
that
he
can
get
nothing
more
out
of
you
he
moves
his
family
and
goods
to
some
other
part
of
the
country
he
then
begins
the
old
game
with
somebody
else
borrowing
a
sovereign
off
you
for
the
expense
of
moving
as
for
gratitude
he
never
thinks
of
it
the
other
day
a
man
with
a
game
leg
who
was
in
spite
of
his
lameness
a
good
example
of
the
village
impostor
in
taking
his
departure
from
our
hamlet
gave
out
that
there
was
no
thanks
due
to
the
big
for
the
benefits
he
had
received
for
it
was
writ
in
the
as
how
he
was
to
have
meat
three
times
a
week
and
blankets
at
christmas
as
long
as
he
was
out
of
work
it
is
so
difficult
to
discriminate
between
the
good
and
the
bad
amongst
the
poor
and
it
is
impossible
not
to
feel
pity
for
a
man
who
has
nothing
but
the
workhouse
to
look
forward
to
even
if
he
has
come
down
in
the
world
through
his
own
folly
to
those
who
are
living
in
luxury
the
conditions
under
which
the
poorer
classes
earn
their
daily
bread
and
the
wretched
prospect
which
old
age
or
ill
health
presents
to
them
must
ever
offer
scope
for
deep
reflection
and
compassion
at
the
same
time
it
must
be
remembered
that
in
spite
of
hard
times
and
low
prices
as
affecting
the
farmers
the
agricultural
labourer
is
better
off
than
he
has
ever
been
in
past
times
food
is
very
much
cheaper
and
wages
are
higher
the
farmers
seem
to
be
more
liberal
in
bad
times
than
in
good
it
is
the
same
in
all
kinds
of
business
except
injustice
there
is
no
more
hardening
influence
in
the
affairs
of
life
than
success
it
seems
often
to
dry
up
the
milk
of
human
kindness
in
the
breast
and
make
us
selfish
and
grasping
in
the
good
times
of
farming
there
was
doubtless
much
cause
for
discontent
amongst
the
cotswold
labourers
the
profits
derived
from
farming
were
then
quite
large
the
tendency
of
the
age
however
was
to
treat
the
labouring
man
as
a
mere
machine
instead
of
his
being
allowed
to
share
in
the
general
prosperity
hinc
illae
lacrymae
now
things
are
changed
farmers
are
in
many
cases
paying
wages
out
of
their
fast
diminishing
capital
many
of
them
would
rather
lose
money
than
cut
down
the
wages
then
again
agricultural
labourers
who
are
unable
to
find
work
go
off
to
the
coal
mines
and
big
towns
some
go
into
the
army
others
emigrate
so
that
the
distress
is
not
so
apparent
in
this
district
as
the
badness
of
the
times
would
lead
one
to
expect
the
cotswold
women
obtain
employment
in
the
fields
at
certain
seasons
of
the
year
though
poorly
paid
they
are
usually
more
conscientious
and
than
the
men
most
of
the
cottages
are
kept
scrupulously
clean
they
have
an
air
of
homely
comfort
which
calls
forth
the
admiration
of
all
strangers
the
children
too
when
they
go
to
church
on
sundays
are
dressed
with
a
neatness
and
good
taste
that
are
simply
astonishing
when
one
recalls
the
income
of
a
labourer
on
the
cotswolds
seldom
alas
averaging
more
than
fourteen
shillings
a
week
a
boy
of
twelve
years
of
age
is
able
to
keep
himself
earning
about
five
shillings
per
week
cheerful
and
manly
little
chaps
they
are
to
watch
a
boy
of
fourteen
years
managing
a
couple
of
great
strong
either
at
the
plough
or
with
the
waggons
is
a
sight
to
gladden
the
heart
of
man
it
is
unfortunate
that
there
are
not
more
orchards
attached
to
the
gardens
on
the
cotswolds
the
reader
will
doubtless
remember
johnson
advice
to
his
friends
always
to
have
a
good
orchard
attached
to
their
houses
for
said
he
i
once
knew
a
clergyman
of
small
income
who
brought
up
a
family
very
reputably
which
he
chiefly
fed
on
talking
of
clergymen
i
am
reminded
of
some
stories
a
neighbour
of
ours
an
excellent
fellow
lately
told
me
about
his
parishioners
on
the
cotswolds
one
old
man
being
asked
why
he
liked
the
vicar
made
answer
as
follows
why
he
be
so
after
the
same
man
lately
said
to
the
parson
sir
you
be
an
hinstrument
and
being
asked
what
he
meant
he
added
an
hinstrument
of
good
in
this
place
this
cotswold
man
was
very
fond
of
reciting
long
passages
out
of
the
psalms
indeed
he
knew
half
the
by
heart
and
one
day
the
hearer
being
rather
wearied
exclaimed
i
must
go
now
for
it
my
to
whom
replied
the
old
man
oh
be
off
with
thee
then
thee
thinks
more
of
thee
belly
than
thee
god
an
old
bedridden
woman
was
visited
by
the
parson
and
the
following
dialogue
took
place
well
annie
how
are
you
o
sir
i
be
so
bad
my
inside
be
that
comical
i
do
know
what
to
do
with
he
he
be
all
on
the
ebb
and
flow
the
same
clergyman
knew
an
old
cotswold
labourer
who
wished
to
get
rid
of
the
evil
influence
of
the
devil
so
hodge
wrote
a
polite
though
firm
epistle
telling
his
satanic
majesty
he
would
have
no
more
to
do
with
him
on
being
asked
where
he
posted
his
letter
he
replied
a
dug
a
hole
i
the
ground
and
popped
un
in
there
he
got
it
right
enough
for
he
left
me
alone
from
that
day
to
this
the
cotswold
people
are
like
their
country
healthy
bright
clean
and
and
the
more
educated
and
refined
a
man
may
happen
to
be
the
more
in
touch
he
will
be
with
them
not
because
the
peasants
are
educated
and
refined
so
much
as
because
they
are
not
and
but
simple
honest
folk
who
mind
their
own
business
and
have
not
sought
out
many
inventions
i
am
referring
now
to
the
labourers
because
the
farmers
are
a
totally
different
class
of
men
the
latter
are
on
the
whole
an
excellent
type
of
what
john
bull
ought
to
be
the
labouring
class
however
still
maintain
the
old
characteristics
a
primitive
people
as
often
as
not
they
are
gentlemen
in
the
simple
matter
of
dress
there
is
a
striking
resemblance
between
the
garb
of
these
country
people
and
that
of
the
highly
educated
and
refined
it
is
an
acknowledged
principle
or
rather
i
should
say
an
unwritten
law
in
these
days
at
all
events
as
far
as
men
are
concerned
that
to
be
well
dressed
all
that
is
required
of
us
is
to
be
badly
simplicity
is
a
quâ
and
we
are
further
required
to
abstain
from
showing
bad
taste
in
the
choice
of
shades
and
colours
and
to
wear
nothing
that
does
not
serve
a
purpose
to
simple
country
folk
all
these
things
come
by
nature
they
never
trouble
their
heads
about
what
clothes
they
shall
wear
the
result
is
the
eye
is
seldom
offended
in
country
places
by
the
latest
inventions
of
tailors
and
hatters
and
the
ridiculous
changes
of
fashion
in
which
the
greater
part
of
the
civilised
world
is
wont
to
delight
here
are
to
be
seen
no
hideous
checks
but
plain
honest
clothes
of
corduroy
or
rough
cloth
in
natural
colours
no
absurd
little
curly
billycocks
but
good
strong
hats
of
black
beaver
in
winter
to
keep
off
the
rain
and
of
white
straw
in
summer
to
keep
off
the
heat
no
white
satin
ties
which
always
look
dirty
such
as
one
sees
in
london
and
other
great
towns
but
broad
scarves
of
many
colours
or
of
blue
birdseye
mellowed
by
age
the
fact
is
that
simplicity
the
very
essence
of
good
taste
is
apparent
only
in
the
garments
of
the
and
the
people
in
england
this
is
one
more
proof
of
the
truth
of
the
old
saying
simplicity
is
nature
first
step
and
the
last
of
art
the
greatest
character
we
ever
possessed
in
the
village
was
undoubtedly
tom
peregrine
the
keeper
a
man
take
him
for
all
in
all
i
shall
not
look
upon
his
like
again
the
eldest
son
of
the
principal
tenant
on
the
manor
and
belonging
to
a
family
of
yeoman
farmers
who
had
been
settled
in
the
place
for
a
hundred
years
he
suddenly
found
that
he
could
not
farming
and
took
up
his
residence
as
an
independent
gentleman
in
a
comfortable
cottage
at
the
gate
of
the
manor
house
then
he
started
a
sack
business
a
trade
which
is
often
adopted
in
these
parts
by
those
who
are
in
want
of
a
better
the
business
consists
in
buying
up
odds
and
ends
of
sacks
and
letting
them
out
on
hire
at
a
handsome
profit
he
was
always
intensely
fond
of
shooting
and
fishing
indeed
the
following
description
which
sir
roger
de
coverley
gave
the
spectator
of
a
plain
country
fellow
who
rid
before
them
when
they
were
on
their
way
to
the
assizes
suits
him
exactly
he
is
a
yeoman
of
about
an
hundred
pounds
a
year
and
knocks
down
a
dinner
with
his
gun
twice
or
thrice
a
week
he
would
be
a
good
neighbour
if
he
did
not
destroy
so
many
partridges
in
short
he
is
a
very
sensible
man
shoots
flying
and
has
been
several
times
foreman
of
the
petty
jury
perhaps
with
regard
to
the
shoots
flying
the
reservation
should
be
added
that
should
he
have
seen
a
covey
of
partridges
bathering
in
a
ploughed
field
within
convenient
distance
of
a
stone
wall
or
thick
fence
he
might
not
have
been
averse
to
knocking
over
a
brace
for
supper
on
the
ground
and
we
had
almost
forgotten
to
explain
that
it
was
for
the
table
that
he
used
to
knock
down
a
dinner
with
his
gun
twice
or
thrice
a
week
and
not
his
own
for
some
years
ago
he
persuaded
the
squire
to
take
him
into
his
service
as
gamekeeper
when
we
came
to
take
up
our
abode
at
the
manor
we
found
that
he
was
a
sort
of
standing
dish
on
the
place
such
a
keen
sportsman
it
was
explained
was
better
in
our
service
than
kicking
his
heels
about
the
village
and
on
his
father
farm
as
an
independent
gentleman
and
so
this
is
how
tom
peregrine
came
into
our
service
for
my
part
i
liked
the
man
he
was
so
delightfully
mysterious
and
the
place
would
never
have
been
the
same
without
him
for
he
became
part
and
parcel
with
the
trees
and
the
fields
and
every
living
thing
nor
would
the
woods
and
the
path
by
the
brook
and
the
breezy
wolds
ever
have
been
quite
the
same
if
his
quaint
figure
had
no
longer
appeared
suddenly
there
many
a
time
was
i
startled
by
the
sudden
apparition
of
tom
peregrine
when
out
shooting
on
the
hill
he
seemed
to
spring
up
from
the
ground
like
herne
the
hunter
shaggy
and
lean
and
shrewd
with
pointed
ears
and
tail
cropped
short
half
lurcher
and
half
cur
his
dog
attends
him
the
above
lines
of
cowper
exactly
describe
the
keeper
irish
terrier
the
dog
was
almost
as
deep
and
mysterious
as
the
man
himself
when
in
the
woods
tom
attitude
and
gait
would
at
times
resemble
the
movements
of
a
cock
pheasant
now
stealing
along
for
a
few
yards
listening
for
the
slightest
sound
of
any
animal
stirring
in
the
underwood
now
standing
on
tiptoe
for
a
time
with
bated
breath
did
a
blackbird
that
dusky
sentinel
of
the
woods
utter
her
characteristic
note
of
warning
he
would
whisper
hark
then
after
due
deliberation
he
would
add
is
a
fox
or
there
a
fox
in
the
grove
and
then
he
would
steal
gently
up
to
try
to
get
a
glimpse
of
reynard
he
never
looked
more
natural
than
when
carrying
seven
or
eight
brace
of
partridges
four
or
five
hares
and
a
lease
of
pheasants
it
was
a
labour
of
love
to
him
to
carry
such
a
load
back
to
the
village
after
a
day
shooting
in
his
pockets
alone
he
could
stow
away
more
game
than
most
men
can
conveniently
carry
on
their
backs
he
was
the
best
hand
at
catching
trout
the
country
could
produce
with
a
rod
and
line
he
could
pull
them
out
on
days
when
nobody
else
could
get
a
rise
he
could
not
understand
fishing
always
using
the
sunk
fly
muddling
work
he
used
to
call
the
floating
method
of
fly
fishing
but
tom
peregrine
was
cleverer
with
the
than
with
the
rod
any
trout
he
could
reach
with
the
net
was
promptly
pulled
out
if
we
particularly
wanted
a
fish
then
he
would
talk
all
day
about
any
subject
under
the
sun
politics
art
roman
antiquities
literature
and
every
form
of
sport
were
discussed
with
equal
facility
one
day
when
i
was
engaged
in
a
slight
controversy
with
his
own
father
the
keeper
said
to
me
i
should
take
any
notice
whatever
of
him
then
he
added
with
a
sigh
these
gloucestershire
folk
are
comical
people
ah
is
a
wise
son
that
knows
his
own
father
in
gloucestershire
it
peregrine
said
i
putting
the
shakespearian
cart
before
the
horse
yes
it
be
to
be
sure
to
be
sure
was
the
reply
i
ca
make
out
nohow
they
funny
folk
in
gloucestershire
he
gave
me
the
following
account
of
the
chopping
of
one
of
our
foxes
i
knew
there
was
a
fox
in
the
grove
and
there
sure
enough
he
was
but
when
he
went
toward
the
the
hounds
come
along
and
him
the
and
then
they
bowled
him
over
it
were
a
very
comical
job
i
never
see
such
a
job
in
all
my
life
i
knew
it
would
be
a
case
he
added
with
a
chuckle
the
fact
is
with
that
deadly
aversion
to
all
the
vulpine
race
common
to
all
keepers
he
dearly
loved
to
see
a
fox
killed
no
matter
how
or
where
but
to
see
one
chopped
without
any
of
that
muddling
round
and
messing
about
as
he
delighted
to
call
a
hunting
run
seemed
to
him
the
very
acme
of
satisfaction
and
despatch
and
here
it
may
be
said
that
tom
peregrine
name
did
not
bely
him
not
only
were
the
keen
brown
eye
and
the
handsome
aquiline
beak
marked
characteristics
of
his
classic
features
but
in
temperament
and
habit
he
bore
a
singular
resemblance
to
the
king
of
all
the
falcons
who
more
delighted
in
striking
down
the
partridge
or
the
wild
duck
what
more
assiduous
destroyer
of
ground
game
and
vermin
ever
existed
than
tom
peregrine
there
never
was
a
man
so
happily
named
and
so
eminently
fitted
to
fulfil
the
destinies
of
a
gamekeeper
who
loves
to
trap
the
wily
stoat
who
loves
the
plover
piping
note
who
loves
to
wring
the
weasel
throat
tom
peregrine
what
time
the
wintry
woods
we
walk
no
need
have
we
of
lure
or
hawk
have
we
not
tom
to
and
talk
tom
peregrine
when
to
the
withybed
we
spy
a
hungry
hern
or
mallard
fly
bedad
we
bag
un
by
and
by
tom
peregrine
creep
sir
without
a
sound
and
bide
thy
time
neath
yonder
then
knock
un
over
on
the
ground
tom
peregrine
and
so
one
might
go
on
a
more
amusing
companion
or
keener
fisherman
never
stepped
he
had
all
sorts
of
quaint
gloucestershire
expressions
which
rolled
out
one
after
the
other
during
a
day
fishing
or
shooting
then
he
was
very
fond
of
reading
amusing
pieces
at
village
entertainments
often
copying
the
broad
gloucestershire
dialect
apparently
he
was
not
aware
that
his
own
brogue
smacked
somewhat
of
gloucestershire
too
at
home
in
his
own
house
he
was
most
friendly
and
hospitable
if
he
could
get
you
to
step
in
he
would
offer
you
gooseberry
ginger
cowslip
and
currant
wine
sloe
gin
as
well
as
the
juice
of
the
elder
the
blackberry
the
grape
and
countless
other
vintages
which
the
good
dames
of
gloucestershire
pride
themselves
on
preparing
with
such
skill
very
excellent
some
of
these
drinks
are
the
british
farmer
is
remarkably
fond
of
a
lord
if
you
wanted
to
put
him
into
a
good
temper
for
a
month
the
best
plan
would
be
to
ask
a
lord
to
shoot
over
his
land
and
tell
him
privately
to
make
a
great
point
of
shaking
the
honest
yeoman
by
the
hand
and
all
that
kind
of
thing
by
the
bye
i
was
once
told
by
a
coachman
that
he
was
sure
the
bicester
hounds
were
a
pack
for
he
had
seen
in
the
papers
that
no
less
than
four
lords
hunted
with
them
there
is
little
harm
in
this
extraordinarily
widespread
admiration
for
titles
it
is
common
to
all
nations
we
can
all
love
a
lord
provided
that
he
be
a
gentleman
the
gentlemen
of
england
whether
titled
or
untitled
are
in
thought
and
feeling
a
very
high
type
of
the
human
race
but
the
man
i
like
best
to
meet
is
he
who
either
by
natural
insight
or
by
the
trained
habit
of
his
mind
is
able
to
look
upon
all
mortals
with
eyes
unprejudiced
by
outward
show
and
circumstance
judging
them
by
character
alone
such
a
man
may
not
be
understood
or
be
awarded
the
credit
due
to
him
as
lord
of
the
lion
heart
and
despiser
of
sycophants
and
cringers
the
habit
of
mind
nevertheless
is
worth
cultivating
it
will
be
so
very
useful
some
day
when
mortal
garments
have
been
put
off
and
the
vast
inequalities
of
destiny
adjusted
and
we
all
stand
unclothed
before
the
judge
tom
peregrine
was
not
a
great
frequenter
of
the
church
indeed
both
father
and
son
often
remarked
to
me
that
was
a
pity
there
was
not
a
chapel
of
ease
put
up
in
the
hamlet
the
village
church
being
a
full
mile
away
however
when
tom
was
ailing
from
any
cause
or
other
he
immediately
sent
for
the
parson
and
told
him
that
he
intended
in
future
to
go
to
church
regularly
every
sunday
shakespeare
would
have
enquired
if
he
was
troubled
about
some
act
that
had
no
relish
of
salvation
i
thomas
he
a
terrible
coward
i
here
quote
mrs
peregrine
he
ca
to
have
anything
with
him
yet
he
do
mind
killing
any
animal
he
made
a
tremendous
fuss
about
a
sore
finger
he
had
at
one
time
and
when
the
doctor
exclaimed
like
romeo
courage
man
the
hurt
can
not
be
much
tom
peregrine
replied
with
much
the
same
humour
as
poor
mercutio
no
is
not
so
deep
as
a
well
nor
so
wide
as
a
church
door
but
is
enough
i
do
not
mean
to
infer
that
he
quoted
shakespeare
but
he
used
words
to
the
same
effect
if
asked
whether
he
had
read
shakespeare
he
might
possibly
have
given
the
same
reply
as
the
young
woman
in
life
below
kitty
shikspur
shikspur
who

shikspur
lady
you
have
an
immense
pleasure
to
let
it
be
said
however
that
in
many
respects
tom
was
an
exceedingly
and
clever
man
the
family
of
peregrines
were
noted
like
sir
roger
de
coverley
for
their
great
friendliness
to
foxes
and
to
their
credit
let
it
be
said
that
they
have
preserved
them
religiously
for
very
many
years
i
scarcely
ever
heard
a
word
of
complaint
from
them
all
honour
to
those
who
neither
hunt
nor
care
for
hunting
yet
who
put
up
with
a
large
amount
of
damage
to
crops
and
fences
as
well
as
loss
of
poultry
and
ground
game
and
yet
preserve
the
foxes
for
a
sport
in
which
they
do
not
themselves
take
part
when
conversing
with
me
on
the
subject
of
preserving
foxes
old
mr
peregrine
would
wax
quite
enthusiastic
you
should
put
a
barley
rick
in
the
conygers
and
thatch
it
and
there
would
always
be
a
fox
he
would
remark
all
this
i
hold
to
be
distinctly
creditable
for
what
is
there
to
prevent
a
farmer
from
pursuing
a
selfish
policy
and
warning
the
whole
hunt
off
his
land
the
village
parson
is
quite
a
character
you
do
not
often
see
the
like
nowadays
an
excellent
man
in
every
way
and
having
his
duty
at
heart
he
is
one
of
the
few
tories
of
the
old
school
that
are
left
to
us
ruling
his
parish
with
a
rod
of
iron
he
is
loved
and
respected
by
most
of
his
flock
in
the
parish
council
at
the
board
of
guardians
his
word
is
law
he
seldom
goes
away
from
the
village
save
for
his
annual
holiday
yet
he
knows
all
that
is
going
on
in
the
great
metropolis
and
will
tell
you
the
latest
bit
of
gossip
from
belgravia
he
has
a
good
property
of
his
own
in
somersetshire
but
to
his
credit
let
it
be
said
that
his
affections
are
entirely
centred
in
the
little
cotswold
village
which
he
has
ruled
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
full
loth
were
him
to
curse
for
his
tithes
but
rather
would
be
given
out
of
doubt
unto
his
poore
parishens
about
of
his
and
eke
of
his
substance
he
could
in
little
thing
have
suffisance
wide
was
his
parish
and
houses
far
asunder
but
he
ne
left
not
for
no
rain
nor
thunder
in
sickness
and
in
mischief
to
visit
the
farthest
in
his
parish
much
and
lit
upon
his
feet
and
in
his
hand
a
staff
this
noble
ensample
to
his
sheep
he
gaf
that
first
he
wrought
and
afterwards
he
taught
chaucer
sermons
are
not
so
lengthy
in
our
church
as
they
were
three
hundred
years
ago
rudder
mentions
that
a
parson
of
the
name
of
winnington
used
to
preach
here
for
two
hours
at
a
time
regularly
turning
the
for
in
those
days
were
placed
near
the
pulpit
and
the
clergy
used
to
vie
with
each
other
as
to
who
could
preach
the
longest
i
do
not
know
if
barrow
was
ever
surpassed
in
this
respect
history
relates
that
he
succeeded
in
emptying
his
church
of
the
whole
congregation
including
the
lord
mayor
and
aldermen
of
london
one
man
only
an
apprentice
remaining
to
the
bitter
end
misguided
laymen
used
to
amuse
themselves
in
the
same
way
fozbrooke
mentions
that
one
will
hulcote
a
zealous
lay
preacher
after
the
reformation
used
to
mount
the
pulpit
in
a
velvet
bonnet
a
damask
gown
and
a
gold
chain
what
an
ass
he
must
have
looked
this
reminds
me
that
at
the
age
of
i
accepted
the
office
of
churchwarden
of
a
certain
country
parish
i
do
not
recommend
any
of
my
readers
to
become
churchwardens
you
become
a
sort
of
acting
to
the
parson
liable
to
be
called
out
on
duty
at
a
moment
notice
no
a
young
man
might
with
some
advantage
to
others
and
credit
to
himself
take
upon
himself
the
office
of
parish
councillor
poor
law
guardian
inspector
of
lunatic
asylums
high
sheriff
or
even
public
hangman
but
save
oh
save
us
from
being
churchwardens
to
be
obliged
to
attend
those
terrible
institutions
called
vestry
meetings
and
to
receive
each
year
an
examination
paper
from
the
archdeacon
of
the
diocese
propounding
such
questions
as
do
you
attend
church
regularly
if
not
why
not
is
the
natural
destiny
of
the
churchwarden
and
is
more
than
human
nature
can
stand
in
short
my
advice
to
those
thinking
of
becoming
churchwardens
is
do
with
a
very
big
according
to
the
diary
of
master
william
silence
in
the
olden
times
a
pedlar
would
occasionally
arrive
at
the
church
door
during
the
sermon
and
proceed
to
advertise
his
wares
at
the
top
of
his
voice
whereupon
the
parson
speedily
deserted
by
the
female
portion
of
his
congregation
and
by
not
a
few
of
the
other
sex
was
obliged
to
bring
his
discourse
to
a
somewhat
inglorious
conclusion
we
learn
from
the
same
work
that
the
churchwardens
were
in
the
habit
of
disbursing
large
sums
for
the
destruction
of
foxes
when
a
fox
was
marked
to
ground
the
church
bell
was
rung
as
a
signal
summoning
every
man
who
owned
a
pickaxe
a
gun
or
a
terrier
dog
to
lend
a
hand
in
destroying
him
we
are
talking
of
two
or
three
hundred
years
ago
when
the
stag
was
the
animal
usually
hunted
by
hounds
on
the
cotswolds
and
in
other
parts
of
england
our
village
is
a
favourite
meet
of
the
foxhounds
an
amusing
story
is
told
of
a
former
tenant
of
the
court
house
a
london
gentleman
who
rented
the
place
for
a
time
he
is
reported
to
have
made
a
special
request
to
the
master
of
the
hounds
that
when
the
meet
was
held
at
the
court
his
lordship
would
make
the
fox
pass
in
front
of
the
windows
for
said
he
i
have
several
friends
coming
from
london
to
see
the
hunt
in
a
hunting
district
such
as
this
the
owners
and
occupiers
of
the
various
country
houses
are
usually
enthusiastic
devotees
of
the
chase
the
present
holder
of
the
liberty
adjoining
us
is
a
of
the
old
school
an
excellent
sportsman
and
a
wonderful
judge
of
a
horse
he
dines
in
pink
the
best
part
of
the
year
drives
his
with
some
skill
and
wears
the
beaver
hat
we
have
many
other
interesting
characters
in
our
village
human
nature
varies
so
delightfully
that
just
as
with
faces
so
each
individual
character
has
something
to
distinguish
it
from
the
rest
of
the
world
the
autocratic
farmer
of
the
old
school
is
there
of
course
and
a
rare
good
specimen
he
is
of
a
race
that
has
almost
disappeared
then
we
have
the
village
lunatic
whose
mania
is
religious
enthusiasm
if
you
go
to
call
on
him
he
will
ask
you
if
you
are
saved
and
explain
to
you
how
his
own
salvation
was
brought
about
unfortunately
one
of
his
hobbies
is
to
keep
fowls
and
pigs
in
his
house
so
that
fleas
are
more
or
less
numerous
there
and
your
visits
are
consequently
few
and
far
between
the
village
quack
who
professes
to
cure
every
complaint
under
the
sun
either
in
mankind
horses
dogs
or
anything
else
by
means
of
herbs
buttonholes
you
sometimes
in
the
village
street
if
once
he
starts
talking
you
know
that
you
are
booked
for
the
day
he
is
rather
a
bore
and
is
uncommonly
fond
of
quoting
the
scriptures
in
support
of
his
theories
but
there
is
something
about
the
man
one
can
not
help
liking
his
wonderful
infallibility
in
curing
disease
is
set
down
by
himself
to
divine
inspiration
many
a
vision
has
he
seen
unfortunately
his
doctrines
though
excellent
in
theory
are
seldom
successful
in
practice
an
excellent
prescription
which
i
am
informed
completely
cured
a
man
of
indigestion
is
one
of
his
mixtures
last
thing
at
night
and
the
first
chapter
of
john
carefully
perused
and
digested
on
top
i
called
on
the
old
gentleman
the
other
day
and
persuaded
him
to
give
me
a
short
lecture
the
following
is
the
gist
of
what
he
said
first
of
all
you
must
know
that
the
elder
is
good
for
anything
in
the
world
but
especially
for
swellings
if
you
put
some
of
the
leaves
on
your
face
they
will
cure
toothache
in
five
minutes
then
for
the
nerves
nothing
like
the
berries
of
ivy
yarrow
makes
a
splendid
ointment
and
be
sure
and
remember
solomon
seal
for
bruises
and
comfrey
for
and
broken
bones
camomile
cures
indigestion
and
buds
make
a
stout
man
thin
soak
some
ash
leaves
in
hot
water
and
you
will
have
a
drink
that
is
better
than
any
tea
and
destroys
the
bark
is
a
splendid
emetic
and
mountain
flax
which
grows
everywhere
on
the
cotswolds
is
uncommon
good
for
the
nettles
is
good
for
stings
damp
them
and
rub
them
on
to
a
sting
and
they
will
take
away
the
pain
directly
on
my
suggesting
that
stinging
nettles
were
rather
a
desperate
remedy
he
assured
me
that
they
acted
as
a
blister
and
counteracted
the
now
i
tell
you
an
uncommon
good
thing
to
preserve
the
teeth
he
went
on
and
that
is
to
them
once
or
twice
a
week
you
buys
a
brush
at
the
chymists
you
know
they
makes
them
specially
for
it
oh
is
a
capital
good
thing
to
cleanse
the
teeth
occasionally
he
wound
up
by
telling
me
a
story
of
a
celebrated
doctor
who
left
a
sealed
book
not
to
be
opened
till
after
his
death
when
it
was
to
be
sold
at
auction
it
fetched
six
hundred
pounds
the
man
who
paid
this
sum
was
horrified
on
opening
it
to
find
it
only
contained
the
following
excellent
piece
of
advice
always
remember
to
keep
the
feet
warm
and
the
head
cool
as
i
said
and
thanked
him
for
his
lecture
he
said
those
doctors
chemicals
destroy
the
and
be
sure
and
put
down
rue
for
the
heart
and
burdock
is
splendid
for
the
liver
nor
must
mention
be
omitted
of
old
isaac
sly
a
labouring
fellow
with
a
squint
in
one
eye
and
blind
of
the
other
who
at
first
sight
might
appear
a
bad
man
to
meet
on
a
dark
night
but
is
harmless
enough
when
you
know
him
he
haunts
the
lanes
at
certain
seasons
of
the
year
carrying
an
enormous
flag
and
invariably
greets
you
with
the
intelligence
that
he
will
bring
the
flag
up
next
christmas
the
same
as
usual
according
to
custom
he
is
the
last
vestige
of
the
old
wandering
minstrels
of
bygone
days
playing
his
inharmonious
concertina
in
the
hall
of
the
manor
house
regularly
at
christmas
and
at
other
festivals
nor
must
we
forget
dear
honest
white
the
kindest
and
most
pompous
of
men
who
after
fulfilling
his
destiny
as
head
butler
in
a
great
establishment
and
earning
golden
opinions
from
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
men
finally
settled
down
to
a
quiet
country
life
in
a
pretty
cottage
in
our
village
where
he
is
the
life
and
soul
of
every
convivial
gathering
and
beanfeast
carving
a
york
ham
or
a
sirloin
with
great
nicety
and
judgment
he
has
seen
much
of
men
and
manners
in
his
day
and
has
a
fund
of
information
on
all
kinds
of
subjects
having
plenty
of
leisure
he
is
a
capital
hand
at
finding
the
whereabouts
of
outlying
foxes
and
once
earned
the
eternal
gratitude
of
the
whole
neighbourhood
by
starting
a
fine
greyhound
fox
known
as
the
old
customer
out
of
a
decayed
and
hollow
tree
that
lay
in
an
unfrequented
spot
by
the
river
he
poked
him
out
with
a
long
pole
and
gave
the
view
holloa
just
as
the
hounds
had
drawn
all
the
coverts
blank
and
the
people
faces
were
as
blank
as
the
coverts
whereupon
such
a
run
was
enjoyed
as
had
not
been
indulged
in
for
many
a
long
day
but
what
of
our
miller
our
good
honest
gentleman
farmer
and
miller
now
alas
retired
from
active
business
what
can
i
say
of
him
i
show
you
a
man
worthy
to
sit
amongst
kings
a
little
garrulous
and
inquisitive
at
times
yet
a
conqueror
for
all
that
in
the
battle
and
one
of
whom
it
may
in
truth
be
said
and
thus
he
bore
without
abuse
the
grand
old
name
of
gentleman
as
to
the
morals
of
the
gloucestershire
peasants
in
general
and
of
our
village
in
particular
it
may
be
said
that
they
are
on
the
whole
excellent
in
one
respect
only
they
are
rather
casual
not
to
say
prehistoric
the
following
story
gives
one
a
very
good
idea
of
the
casual
nature
of
hamlet
morals
a
parson
i
do
not
know
of
which
village
but
it
was
somewhere
in
this
neighbourhood
paid
a
visit
to
a
newly
married
man
to
speak
seriously
about
the
exceptionally
premature
arrival
of
an
heir
this
is
a
terrible
affair
said
the
parson
on
entering
the
cottage
yaas
a
bad
job
to
be
sure
replied
the
man
and
what
will
yer
take
to
drink
let
it
in
justice
be
said
that
such
episodes
are
the
exception
and
not
the
rule
among
the
characters
to
be
met
with
in
our
cotswold
hamlet
is
the
village
politician
many
a
pleasant
chat
have
we
enjoyed
in
his
snug
cottage
whilst
the
honest
proprietor
was
having
his
cup
of
tea
and
bread
and
butter
after
his
work
common
sense
he
has
to
a
remarkable
degree
and
a
good
deal
more
knowledge
than
most
people
give
him
credit
for
he
is
a
radical
of
course
nine
out
of
ten
labourers
are
and
a
very
good
case
he
makes
out
for
his
way
of
thinking
if
one
can
only
put
oneself
in
his
place
for
a
time
we
have
endeavoured
to
convert
him
to
our
way
of
thinking
but
the
strong
reflective
mind
illi
robur
et
aes
triplex
circa
pectus
erat
is
not
to
be
persuaded
he
will
be
true
to
the
colour
this
is
his
final
answer
even
if
your
arguments
overcome
for
the
time
being
and
you
can
not
help
liking
the
man
for
his
straightforward
nature
he
is
acting
up
to
the
standard
he
has
set
himself
all
through
life
this
above
all
to
thine
own
self
be
true
and
it
must
follow
as
the
night
the
day
thou
canst
not
then
be
false
to
any
man
and
how
many
there
are
in
the
byways
of
england
acting
up
to
this
motto
and
leading
the
lives
of
heroes
though
their
reward
is
not
to
be
found
here
there
is
no
nobler
sight
on
this
earth
than
to
behold
men
of
all
ages
doing
their
duty
to
the
best
of
their
ability
in
spite
of
manifold
hardships
and
many
a
bitter
disappointment
cheerfully
and
manfully
confronting
difficulties
of
all
kinds
and
training
up
children
in
the
fear
and
knowledge
of
god
if
this
is
not
nobleness
there
is
no
such
thing
on
earth
and
it
is
owing
to
the
vast
amount
of
real
genuine
christianity
that
exists
among
these
honest
folk
that
life
is
rendered
on
the
whole
so
cheerful
in
these
cotswold
villages
many
small
faults
the
peasants
doubtless
possess
such
are
inseparable
from
human
nature
the
petty
jealousies
always
to
be
found
where
men
do
congregate
exist
here
and
as
long
as
the
earth
revolves
they
will
continue
to
exist
but
underneath
the
rough
unpolished
exterior
there
is
a
reef
of
gold
far
richer
than
the
mines
of
south
africa
will
ever
produce
and
as
immortal
as
the
souls
in
which
it
lies
so
deeply
rooted
and
embedded
for
the
best
type
of
humanity
we
need
not
search
in
vain
among
the
humble
cottages
of
the
hamlets
of
england
there
shall
we
find
the
courageous
brave
souls
who
scorn
delights
and
live
laborious
days
men
who
estimate
their
fellows
at
their
worth
and
not
according
to
their
social
position
blunt
and
difficult
to
lead
not
out
of
hardness
of
heart
or
obstinate
pigheadedness
but
as
burns
has
put
it
for
the
glorious
priviledge
of
being
independant
a
few
such
are
to
be
found
in
all
our
rural
villages
if
one
looks
for
them
and
if
they
are
the
exceptions
to
the
general
rule
it
must
also
be
remembered
that
men
with
character
are
equally
rare
amongst
the
upper
and
middle
classes
talking
of
village
politics
i
shall
never
forget
a
meeting
held
at
northleach
a
few
years
ago
it
was
at
a
time
when
the
balance
of
parties
was
so
even
that
our
unionist
member
was
returned
by
the
bare
majority
of
three
votes
only
to
be
unseated
a
few
weeks
afterwards
on
a
recount
northleach
is
a
very
radical
town
about
six
miles
from
my
home
and
when
i
agreed
to
take
the
chair
i
little
knew
what
an
unpleasant
job
i
had
taken
in
hand
our
member
for
some
reason
or
other
was
unable
to
attend
i
therefore
found
myself
at
one
evening
facing
two
hundred
radicals
with
only
one
other
speaker
besides
myself
to
keep
the
ball
my
companion
was
one
of
those
professional
politicians
of
the
baser
sort
who
call
themselves
unionists
because
it
pays
better
for
the
politician
in
just
the
same
way
as
ambitious
young
men
among
the
upper
classes
sometimes
become
radicals
on
the
strength
of
there
being
more
opening
for
them
on
the
liberal
side
well
this
fellow
bellowed
away
in
the
usual
ranting
style
for
about
of
an
hour
his
eloquence
was
great
but
truth
was
more
honoured
in
the
breach
than
in
the
observance
so
that
when
he
sat
down
and
my
turn
came
the
audience
instead
of
being
convinced
was
fairly
rabid
i
was
very
young
at
that
time
and
fearfully
nervous
added
to
which
i
was
never
much
of
a
speaker
and
if
interrupted
at
all
usually
lost
the
thread
of
my
argument
after
a
bit
they
began
shouting
speak
up
the
more
they
shouted
the
more
mixed
i
got
when
once
the
spirit
of
insubordination
is
roused
in
these
fellows
it
spreads
like
the
din
became
so
great
i
could
not
hear
myself
speak
in
about
five
minutes
there
would
have
been
a
row
suddenly
a
bright
idea
occurred
to
me
listen
to
me
i
shouted
as
you
wo
hear
me
speak
perhaps
you
will
allow
me
to
sing
you
a
song
i
had
a
fairly
strong
voice
and
could
go
up
a
good
height
so
i
gave
them
tom
bowling
directly
i
started
you
could
have
heard
a
pin
drop
they
gave
me
a
fair
hearing
all
through
and
when
as
a
final
climax
i
finished
up
with
a
prolonged
b
flat
a
very
loud
and
long
note
which
sounded
to
me
something
between
a
view
holloa
and
the
whistle
of
a
penny
steamboat
but
which
came
in
nicely
as
a
sort
of
de
fairly
astonishing
hodge
their
enthusiasm
knew
no
bounds
they
cheered
and
cheered
again
hand
shaking
went
on
all
round
whilst
the
biggest
radical
of
the
lot
stood
up
and
shouted
you
be
a
little
liberal
i
know
and
the
other
blokes
hired
you
whether
we
won
any
votes
that
evening
i
am
doubtful
but
certain
i
am
that
this
meeting
which
started
so
inauspiciously
was
more
successful
than
many
others
in
which
i
have
taken
part
in
a
radical
place
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
we
left
it
amid
a
shower
of
stones
from
the
boys
outside
i
do
not
think
there
is
anything
i
dislike
more
than
standing
up
to
address
a
village
audience
on
the
politics
of
the
day
unless
you
happen
to
be
a
very
taking
speaker
which
his
greatest
friends
could
not
accuse
the
present
writer
of
being
agricultural
labourers
are
a
most
unsympathetic
audience
they
will
sit
solemnly
through
a
long
speech
without
even
winking
an
eye
and
your
best
hits
are
passed
by
in
solemn
silence
to
the
nervous
speaker
a
little
applause
occasionally
is
doubtless
encouraging
but
if
you
want
to
get
it
you
must
put
somebody
down
among
the
audience
and
pay
them
half
a
crown
to
make
a
noise
i
suppose
no
better
fellow
or
more
suitable
candidate
for
a
cotswold
constituency
ever
walked
than
colonel
chester
master
of
the
abbey
yet
his
efforts
to
win
the
seat
under
the
new
ballot
act
were
always
unavailing
saving
the
occasion
on
which
he
got
in
by
three
votes
and
then
was
turned
out
again
within
a
month
an
unknown
candidate
from
london
i
will
not
say
a
was
able
to
beat
the
local
squire
entirely
owing
to
the
very
fact
that
he
was
a
stranger
there
is
a
good
deal
of
chopping
and
changing
about
among
the
agricultural
voters
in
spite
of
a
general
determination
to
be
true
to
the
yaller
colour
or
the
blue
as
the
case
may
be
as
i
passed
down
the
village
street
on
the
day
on
which
our
last
election
took
place
i
enthusiastically
exclaimed
to
a
in
whom
i
thought
i
recognised
one
of
our
erstwhile
firmest
supporters
we
shall
have
our
man
in
for
a
certainty
this
time
what
in
the
brook
replied
the
turncoat
with
a
glance
at
the
stream
and
not
without
humour
his
face
purple
with
emotion
this
was
somewhat
damping
but
the
hold
of
the
paid
social
agitator
is
very
great
in
these
country
places
and
it
is
scarcely
credible
what
extraordinary
stories
are
circulated
on
the
eve
of
an
election
to
influence
the
voters
at
such
times
even
loyalty
is
at
a
discount
at
a
tory
meeting
a
lecturer
was
showing
a
picture
of
gibraltar
and
expatiating
on
the
english
victory
in
when
sir
george
rooke
won
this
important
stronghold
from
the
spaniards
how
would
you
like
any
one
to
come
and
take
your
land
away
exclaimed
a
radical
with
a
great
show
of
righteous
indignation
and
his
sentiments
received
the
applause
of
all
his
friends
in
these
matters
and
in
the
spirit
of
independence
generally
country
folk
have
much
altered
no
longer
can
it
be
said
as
addison
quaintly
puts
it
in
the
that
they
are
so
used
to
be
dazzled
with
riches
that
they
pay
as
much
deference
to
the
understanding
of
a
man
of
estate
as
of
a
man
of
learning
and
are
very
hardly
brought
to
regard
any
truth
how
important
soever
it
may
be
that
is
preached
to
them
when
they
know
there
are
several
men
of
five
hundred
a
year
who
do
not
believe
it
in
matters
the
labourers
now
show
a
vast
deal
of
common
sense
and
the
only
wonder
is
that
whilst
paying
but
little
deference
either
to
men
of
estate
or
men
of
learning
they
yet
allow
themselves
to
be
bamboozled
by
the
promises
and
claptrap
of
the
paid
agitator
narrow
and
ignorant
as
is
the
toryism
commonly
displayed
in
country
districts
it
is
yet
preferable
from
the
point
of
view
of
those
whose
motto
is
to
the
impossible
utopia
which
the
advanced
radicals
invariably
promise
us
and
never
effect
a
word
now
about
the
farmers
of
gloucestershire
it
is
often
asked
how
do
the
cotswold
farmers
live
in
these
bad
times
i
suppose
the
only
reply
one
can
give
is
the
old
saw
turned
upside
down
they
live
as
the
fishes
do
in
the
sea
the
great
ones
eat
up
the
little
ones
the
tendency
doubtless
in
all
kinds
of
trade
is
for
the
small
capitalists
to
go
to
the
wall
some
of
the
farmers
in
this
district
are
yeoman
princes
not
only
possessing
their
own
freeholds
but
farming
a
thousand
or
fifteen
hundred
acres
in
addition
garne
of
aldsworth
is
a
fine
specimen
of
this
class
he
makes
a
speciality
of
the
original
cotswold
sheep
and
his
rams
being
famous
he
is
able
to
do
very
well
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
there
is
little
demand
for
the
old
breed
of
sheep
the
mutton
being
of
poor
quality
and
the
wool
coarse
and
rough
garne
carries
off
all
the
prizes
at
the
royal
and
other
shows
with
his
magnificent
sheep
a
cross
between
the
hampshire
downs
and
the
cotswold
sheep
has
been
found
to
give
excellent
mutton
as
well
as
fine
and
silky
wool
the
cross
breed
is
gradually
superseding
the
native
sheep
hobbs
of
maiseyhampton
is
famous
for
his
oxford
downs
these
sheep
are
likewise
superior
to
the
cotswold
breed
barley
does
uncommonly
well
on
the
light
limestone
soil
of
these
hills
the
brewers
are
glad
to
get
cotswold
barley
for
malting
purposes
fine
sainfoin
crops
are
grown
and
black
oats
likewise
do
well
the
shallow
porous
soil
requires
rain
at
least
once
a
week
throughout
the
spring
and
summer
the
better
class
of
farmer
on
these
hills
does
not
have
at
all
a
bad
time
even
in
these
days
very
often
they
lead
the
lives
of
squires
more
especially
in
those
hamlets
where
there
is
no
landowner
resident
hunting
shooting
coursing
and
sometimes
fishing
are
enjoyed
by
most
of
these
squireens
and
they
are
a
fine
independent
class
of
englishman
who
get
more
fun
out
of
life
than
many
richer
men
they
will
tell
you
with
regard
to
the
labourers
that
the
following
adage
is
still
to
be
depended
upon

same
with
common
natures

kindly

and

chapter
iv
the
language
of
the
cotswolds
with
some
ancient
songs
and
legends
a
very
marked
characteristic
of
the
village
peasant
is
his
extraordinary
honesty
not
one
in
ten
would
knock
a
pheasant
on
the
head
with
his
stick
if
he
found
one
on
his
allotment
among
the
cabbages
rabbit
poachers
there
are
but
even
these
are
rare
and
as
for
housebreaking
and
robbery
it
simply
does
not
exist
the
manor
house
has
a
tremendous
oak
door
which
is
barred
at
night
by
ponderous
clamps
of
iron
and
many
other
contrivances
but
the
windows
could
be
opened
by
any
moderately
skilful
burglar
in
half
a
minute
there
is
absolutely
nothing
to
prevent
access
to
the
house
at
night
whilst
in
the
daytime
the
doors
are
open
from
morn
till
dewy
eve
most
of
the
windows
are
innocent
of
shutters
when
in
ireland
recently
i
noticed
that
the
gates
in
every
field
were
immensely
strong
generally
of
iron
with
massive
pillars
of
stone
on
either
side
but
in
spite
of
these
precautions
there
was
usually
a
gap
in
the
hedge
close
by
through
which
one
might
safely
have
driven
a
waggon
this
reminded
one
of
the
cotswold
manor
house
and
its
strongly
barricaded
oak
door
surrounded
by
windows
which
any
burglar
could
open
as
easy
as
a
glove
as
tom
peregrine
would
say
a
traveller
with
slouching
gait
and
mouldy
wideawake
hat
passes
through
the
hamlet
occasionally
leading
a
donkey
in
a
cart
this
is
one
of
the
hawkers
these
men
are
usually
poachers
or
receivers
of
poached
goods
they
are
not
averse
to
paying
a
small
sum
for
a
basket
of
trout
or
a
few
partridges
pheasants
hares
or
rabbits
in
the
game
season
whilst
in
spring
they
deal
in
a
small
way
in
the
eggs
of
game
birds
as
often
as
not
this
class
of
man
is
accompanied
by
a
couple
of
dogs
marvellously
trained
in
the
art
of
hunting
the
coverts
and
retrieving
a
pheasant
or
a
rabbit
which
may
be
crouching
in
the
underwood
hares
too
are
taken
by
dogs
in
the
open
fields
one
never
finds
out
much
about
these
gentry
from
the
natives

the
keeper
is
reticent
on
the
subject

kinds
of

town
seven
miles
off
is
occasionally
not
averse
to
a
little
poaching
in
the
roadside
fields
among
the
hares
the
carriers
are
a
great
feature
of
these
rural
villages
they
are
generally
good
fellows
though
some
of
them
are
a
bit
too
fond
of
the
bottle
on
saturday
nights
the
dogs
employed
by
poachers
are
taught
to
keep
out
of
sight
and
avoid
keepers
and
folk
they
know
as
well
as
the
poacher
himself
the
nature
of
their
trade
and
that
the
utmost
secrecy
must
be
observed
to
see
them
trotting
demurely
down
the
road
you
would
never
think
them
capable
of
doing
anything
wrong
a
wave
of
the
hand
and
they
are
into
the
covert
in
a
second
ready
to
pounce
like
a
cat
on
a
sitting
pheasant
one
short
whistle
and
they
are
at
their
master
heels
again
if
in
carrying
game
in
their
mouths
they
spied
or
winded
a
keeper
they
would
in
all
probability
contrive
to
hide
themselves
or
make
tracks
for
the
high
road
as
quickly
as
possible
leaving
their
spoil
in
the
thick
underwood
to
be
left

seen
by

more
than
once
in

month
of
sundays
needless
to
say
there
is
not
much
opportunity
of
studying
the

of
the
country
as
long
as
the
feast
is
progressing
silence
is
golden

the
motto
here
whilst
the

are
being
discussed
but
afterwards
when
the
homeric
desire
of
eating
and
drinking
has
been
expelled
an
adjournment
to
the
club
may
lead
to
a
smoking
concert
and
once
started
there
are
very
few
cotswold
men
who
can
not
sing
a
song
of
at
least
eighteen
verses
for
three
hours
an
uninterrupted
stream
of
music
flows
forth
not
only
solos
but
occasionally
duets
harmoniously
chanted
in
parts
and
rendered
with
the
utmost
pathos
it
can
not
be
said
that
gloucestershire
folk
are
endowed
with
a
large
amount
of
musical
talent
neither
their
ears
nor
their
vocal
chords
are
ever
anything
great
but
what
they
lack
in
quality
they
make
up
in
quantity
and
i
have
listened
to
as
many
as
forty
songs
during
one
evening
some
of
them
most
entertaining
others
extremely
dull
the
songs
the
labourer
most
delights
in
are
those
which
are
typical
of
the
employment
in
which
he
happens
to
be
engaged
some
of
the
old
ballads
handed
down
from
father
to
son
by
oral
tradition
are
very
excellent
the
following
is
a
very
good
instance
of
this
kind
of
song
when
sung
by
the
carter
to
a
good
rollicking
tune
it
goes
with
a
rare
ring
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
it
lasts
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
there
would
be
about
a
dozen
verses
and
the
chorus
is
always
sung
twice
at
the
end
of
each
verse
first
by
the
carter
and
then
by
the
whole
company
now
then
gentlemen

many
years
ere

to
rise
at
daybreak
and
go
his
rounds
each
morn
he
often
took
me
with
him
especially
in
the
spring
i
loved
to
sit
upon

cart
and
hear
my

never

me
as
i
go
driving
past
my
horse
is
such
a
beauty
and
he
jogs
along
so
fast
we
travelled
many
a
weary
mile
and
happy
days
have
had
for
none
can
lead
a
jollier
life
than
jim
the
carter
lad
crack
crack
etc
so
now
i
wish
you
all
good
night
it
time
i
was
away
for
i
know
my
horse
will
weary
if
i
much
longer
stay
to
see
your
smiling
faces
it
makes
my
heart
quite
glad
i
hope
you
drink
your
kind
applause
to
jim
the
carter
lad
crack
crack
etc
the
village
choirs
do
very
well
as
long
as
their
organist
or
vicar
is
not
too
ambitious
in
his
choice
of
music
there
is
a
fatal
tendency
in
many
places
to
do
away
with
the
old
hymns
which
every
one
has
known
from
a
boy
and
substitute
the
very
inferior
modern
ones
now
to
be
found
in
our
books
this
is
the
greatest
mistake
if
i
may
say
so
a
man
is
far
more
likely
to
sing
and
feel
deeply
when
he
is
singing
those
simple
words
and
notes
he
learnt
long
ago
in
the
nursery
at
home
and
there
is
nothing
finer
in
the
world
than
some
of
our
old
english
hymns
i
appeal
to
any
readers
who
have
known
what
it
is
to
feel
deeply
and
few
there
are
to
whom
this
does
not
apply
if
some
of
those
moments
of
their
lives
when
the
thoughts
have
soared
into
the
higher
regions
of
emotion
have
not
been
those
which
followed
the
opening
strain
of
the
organ
as
it
quietly
ushered
in
the
old
evening
hymn
abide
with
me
fast
falls
the
eventide
or
any
other
hymn
of
the
same
kind
it
is
the
same
in
the
vast
cathedral
as
in
the
little
norman
village
church
there
are
fifty
hymns
in
our
book
which
would
be
sufficient
to
provide
the
best
possible
music
for
our
country
churches
the
best
organists
realise
this
joseph
barnby
always
chose
the
old
hymns
and
you
will
hear
them
at
westminster
and
paul
the
country
organist
however
imagines
that
it
is
his
duty
to
be
always
teaching
his
choir
some
new
and
difficult
tune
the
result
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
being
murder
and
a
rapid
falling
off
in
the
congregation
the
cotswold
folk
on
the
whole
are
fond
of
music
though
they
have
not
a
large
amount
of
talent
for
it
the
chedworth
band
still
goes
the
round
of
the
villages
once
or
twice
a
year
these
men
are
the
descendants
of
the
old
village
musicians
who
to
quote
from
the
musical
for
september
led
the
psalmody
in
the
village
church
sixty
years
ago
with
stringed
and
wind
instruments
charles
smith
of
chedworth
remembers
playing
the
clarionet
in
handel
the
performed
there
in
in
honour
of
the
queen
accession
he
talks
of
a
band
of
twelve
made
up
of
strings
and
i
am
bound
to
say
that
the
music
produced
by
the
chedworth
band
at
the
present
day
though
decidedly
creditable
in
such
an
village
is
rather
like
the
roman
remains
for
which
the
district
is
so
famous
it
savours
somewhat
of
the
prehistoric
but
when
the
band
comes
round
and
plays
in
the
hall
of
our
old
house
on
christmas
eve
i
have
many
a
pleasant
chat
with
the
chedworth
musicians
they
are
so
delightfully
enthusiastic
and
so
grateful
for
being
allowed
to
play
when
i
gave
them
a
cup
of
tea
they
kept
repeating
a
thousand
thanks
for
all
your
kindness
sir
it
is
inevitable
that
men
engaged
day
by
day
and
year
by
year
in
such
monotonous
employ
as
agricultural
labour
should
be
somewhat
lacking
in
acuteness
and
sensibility
in
no
class
is
the
hereditary
influence
so
marked
were
it
otherwise
matters
would
be
in
a
sorry
pass
in
country
places
for
discontent
would
reign
supreme
and
once
let
ambition
mock
their
useful
toil
once
their
sober
wishes
learn
to
stray
how
would
the
necessary
drudgery
of
agricultural
work
be
accomplished
at
all
in
spite
however
of
this
marked
characteristic
of
inertness
hereditary
in
the
first
place
and
fostered
by
the
humdrum
round
of
daily
toil
on
the
farm
there
is
sometimes
to
be
found
a
sense
of
humour
and
a
love
of
merriment
that
is
quite
astonishing
a
good
deal
of
what
is
called
knowledge
of
the
world
which
one
would
have
thought
was
only
to
be
acquired
in
towns
nowadays
penetrates
into
remote
districts
so
that
country
folk
often
have
a
good
idea
of
what
what
i
once
overheard
the
following
conversation
who
your
new
master
dick
he
a
ai
he
oh
no
was
the
reply
he
only
a
jubilee
sense
of
humour
of
a
kind
the
cotswold
labourer
certainly
has
even
though
he
is
quite
unable
to
see
a
large
number
of
apparently
simple
jokes
the
diverting
history
of
john
gilpin
for
instance
read
at
a
smoking
concert
was
received
with
scarce
a
smile
old
mr
peregrine
lately
told
me
an
instance
of
the
extraordinary
secretiveness
of
the
labourer
two
of
his
men
worked
together
in
his
barn
day
after
day
for
several
weeks
during
that
time
they
never
spoke
to
each
other
save
that
one
of
them
would
always
say
the
last
thing
at
night
be
sure
to
shut
the
door
oddly
enough
they
thoroughly
appreciate
the
humour
of
the
wonderful
things
that
went
on
fifty
and
a
hundred
years
ago
the
old
farmer
i
have
just
mentioned
told
me
that
he
remembers
when
he
used
to
go
to
church
fifty
years
ago
how
after
they
had
all
been
waiting
half
an
hour
the
clerk
would
pin
a
notice
in
the
porch
no
church
parson
c
got
the
gout
as
with
history
so
also
with
geography
the
cotswold
labourer
sometimes
gets
a
bit
mixed
be
they
on
in
durbysher
lately
enquired
a
man
at
to
him
replied
a
righteously
indignant
native
of
the
same
village
as
the
english
army
killed
ten
thousand
durvishers
dervishes
bedad
answered
his
friend
there
wo
be
many
left
in
durbysher
if
they
goes
on
un
much
longer
another
story
lately
told
me
in
the
same
village
was
as
follows
an
old
lady
went
to
the
stores
to
buy
candles
and
was
astonished
to
find
that
owing
to
the
war
candles
was
riz
get
along
she
indignantly
exclaimed
tell
me
they
fights
by
one
of
the
cheeriest
fellows
that
ever
worked
for
us
was
a
carter
called
trinder
he
was
the
father
of
by
the
same
wife
he
never
seemed
to
be
worried
in
the
slightest
degree
by
domestic
affairs
and
was
always
happy
and
healthy
and
gay
this
man
wages
would
be
about
twelve
shillings
a
week
not
a
very
large
sum
for
a
man
with
a
score
of
children
then
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
boys
would
go
off
to
work
in
the
fields
at
a
very
early
age
and
by
the
time
they
were
ten
years
old
they
would
be
keeping
themselves
a
large
family
like
this
would
not
have
the
crushing
effect
on
the
labouring
man
that
it
has
on
the
poor
curate
or
city
clerk
nevertheless
one
can
not
help
looking
upon
the
man
as
a
kind
of
hero
when
one
considers
the
enormous
number
of
grandchildren
and
descendants
he
will
have
on
being
asked
the
other
day
how
he
had
contrived
to
maintain
such
a
quiverful
he
answered
i
always
managed
to
get
along
all
right
so
far
i
never
wanted
for
vittals
sir
anyhow
this
was
all
the
information
he
would
give
talking
of
vittals
the
only
meat
the
labouring
man
usually
indulges
in
is
bacon
his
breakfast
consists
of
bread
and
butter
and
either
tea
or
cocoa
for
his
dinner
he
relies
on
bread
and
bacon
occasionally
only
bread
and
cheese
in
the
winter
he
is
home
by
five
and
once
more
has
tea
or
cocoa
or
beer
coffee
is
very
seldom
seen
in
the
cottages
during
the
short
days
there
is
nothing
to
do
but
go
to
bed
in
the
evening
unless
a
walk
of
over
a
mile
to
the
village
inn
is
considered
worth
the
trouble
but
being
tired
and
leg
weary
a
long
walk
does
not
usually
appeal
to
the
men
after
their
evening
meal
so
to
bed
is
the
order
of
the
day
and
thank
heaven
the
sleep
of
a
labouring
man
is
sweet
in
the
longer
days
of
spring
and
summer
there
is
plenty
to
do
in
the
allotments
and
on
the
whole
the
allotments
acts
have
been
a
great
blessing
to
the
labourers
it
is
during
the
three
winter
months
that
penny
readings
and
smoking
concerts
are
so
much
appreciated
in
the
country
too
much
can
not
be
done
in
this
way
to
brighten
the
life
of
the
village
during
the
cold
dark
days
of
december
and
january
for
the
labouring
man
hates
reading
above
all
things
perhaps
the
fact
that
these
simple
folk
do
not
read
the
newspapers
or
only
read
those
parts
in
which
they
have
a
direct
interest
such
as
paragraphs
indulging
in
socialistic
castles
in
the
air
has
its
advantages
inasmuch
as
it
allows
their
common
sense
full
play
in
all
other
matters
unhampered
as
it
is
except
in
this
one
weak
point
of
socialism
by
the
prejudices
of
the
day
so
that
if
one
wanted
to
get
an
unprejudiced
opinion
on
some
great
question
of
right
or
wrong
in
the
consideration
of
which
common
sense
alone
was
required
such
a
question
for
instance
as
is
occasionally
cropping
up
in
these
times
in
our
foreign
policy
one
would
have
to
go
to
the
very
best
men
in
the
country
namely
those
amongst
the
educated
classes
who
think
for
themselves
or
to
men
of
the
lowest
strata
of
society
such
as
these
honest
cotswold
labourers
because
there
is
scarcely
one
man
in
ten
among
the
reading
public
who
is
not
biassed
and
confused
by
the
manifold
contradictions
and
political
claptrap
of
the
daily
papers
and
led
away
by
side
issues
from
a
clear
understanding
of
the
rights
of
every
case
our
free
press
is
doubtless
a
grand
institution
as
with
individuals
however
so
ought
it
to
be
with
nations
let
us
in
our
criticisms
of
the
policy
of
those
who
watch
over
the
destinies
of
other
countries
whilst
firmly
upholding
our
rights
strictly
adhere
to
the
principle
of
the
press
is
every
day
becoming
more
and
more
powerful
for
good
or
evil
its
influence
on
men
minds
has
become
so
marked
that
it
may
with
truth
be
said
that
the
press
rules
public
opinion
rather
than
that
public
opinion
rules
the
press
but
the
writers
of
the
day
will
only
fulfil
their
destiny
aright
by
approaching
every
question
in
a
broad
and
tolerant
spirit
and
by
a
firm
reliance
in
spite
of
the
prejudices
of
the
moment
on
the
ancient
faith
of
however
the
unanimity
recently
shown
by
the
press
in
upholding
our
rights
at
fashoda
was
absolutely
splendid
the
origin
of
the
names
of
the
fields
in
this
district
is
difficult
to
trace
many
a
farm
has
its
barrow
ground
called
after
some
old
burial
mound
situated
there
and
many
names
like
ladbarrow
cocklebarrow
have
the
same
derivation
buryclose
too
is
a
name
often
to
be
found
in
the
villages
and
skeletons
are
sometimes
dug
up
in
meadows
so
called
a
copse
called
deadman
acre
is
supposed
to
have
received
its
name
from
the
fact
that
a
man
died
there
having
sworn
that
he
would
reap
an
acre
of
corn
with
a
sickle
in
a
day
or
perish
in
the
attempt
it
is
more
likely
however
to
be
connected
with
the
barrows
which
are
plentiful
thereabouts
oliver
cromwell
memory
is
still
very
much
respected
among
the
labouring
folk
every
possible
work
is
attributed
to
his
hand
and
even
the
names
of
places
are
set
down
to
his
inventive
genius
thus
they
tell
you
that
when
he
passed
through
aldsworth
he
did
not
think
very
much
of
the
village
it
is
certainly
a
very
dull
little
place
so
he
snapped
his
fingers
and
exclaimed
that
all
worth
on
arriving
at
ready
token
where
was
an
ancient
inn
he
found
it
full
of
guests
he
therefore
exclaimed
it
already
taken
was
ever
such
nonsense
heard
yet
these
good
folk
believe
every
tradition
of
this
kind
and
delight
in
telling
you
such
stories
ready
token
is
a
bleak
spot
standing
very
high
and
having
a
clump
of
trees
on
it
it
is
therefore
conspicuous
for
miles
so
that
when
this
country
was
an
open
moor
ready
token
was
very
useful
as
a
landmark
to
travellers
sawyer
thinks
the
name
is
a
corruption
from
the
celtic
word
rhydd
and
the
saxon
tacen
meaning
the
way
to
the
ford
the
place
being
on
the
road
to
fairford
where
the
coln
is
crossed
one
of
the
chief
traditions
of
this
locality
and
one
that
doubtless
has
more
truth
in
it
than
most
of
the
stories
the
natives
tell
you
relates
that
two
hundred
years
ago
people
were
frequently
murdered
at
ready
token
inn
when
returning
with
their
pockets
full
of
money
from
the
big
fairs
at
gloucester
or
oxford
a
labouring
friend
of
mine
was
telling
me
the
other
day
of
the
wonderful
disappearance
of
a
packman
and
a
jewelrer
as
he
called
him
for
very
many
years
nothing
was
heard
of
them
but
about
twenty
years
ago
some
skellingtons
were
dug
up
on
the
exact
spot
where
the
inn
stood
so
their
disappearance
was
accounted
for
this
same
man
told
me
the
following
story
about
the
origin
of
stone
near
northleach
a
man
stole
a
sheep
and
carried
it
tied
to
his
neck
and
shoulders
by
a
rope
feeling
rather
tired
he
put
the
down
on
top
of
the
stone
to
rest
a
bit
but
suddenly
it
rolled
off
the
other
side
and
hung
him
broke
his
neck
hangman
stone
may
be
seen
to
this
day
the
real
origin
of
the
name
may
be
found
in
fozbrooke
history
of
gloucestershire
it
was
the
place
of
execution
in
roman
times
as
illuminations
in
cases
of
joy
dismissal
from
the
house
in
quarrels
wishing
joy
on
new
year
day
king
and
queen
on
twelfth
day
from
the
saturnalia
holding
up
the
hand
in
sign
of
assent
shaking
hands
are
roman
customs
so
were
executions
just
out
of
the
town
where
also
the
executioner
resided
in
times
this
officer
was
a
man
of
high
dignity
a
very
common
name
in
gloucestershire
for
a
field
or
wood
is
conyger
or
conygre
it
means
the
abode
of
conies
or
rabbits
some
farms
have
their
camp
ground
and
there
sure
enough
if
one
examines
it
carefully
will
be
found
traces
of
some
ancient
british
camp
with
its
old
rampart
running
round
it
but
what
can
be
the
derivation
of
such
names
as
horsecollar
bush
furlong
smoke
acre
furlong
west
chester
hull
cracklands
crane
furlong
sunday
hill
latheram
stoopstone
furlong
pig
bush
furlong
and
barelegged
bush
names
like
pitchwells
where
there
is
a
spring
breakfast
bush
ground
where
no
doubt
hodge
has
had
his
breakfast
for
centuries
under
shelter
of
a
certain
bush
rickbushes
and
longlands
are
all
more
or
less
easy
to
trace
furzey
leaze
furzey
ground
moor
hill
ridged
lands
and
the
pikes
are
all
names
connected
with
the
nature
of
the
fields
or
their
locality
leaze
is
the
provincial
name
for
a
pasture
and
furzey
leaze
would
be
a
rough
ground
where
gorse
was
sprinkled
about
the
pikes
would
be
a
field
abutting
on
an
old
turnpike
gate
the
word
turnpike
is
never
used
in
gloucestershire
it
is
always
the
pike
a
field
is
a
ground
and
a
fence
or
stone
wall
is
a
mound
the
cotswold
folk
do
not
talk
about
houses
they
stick
to
the
old
saxon
termination
and
call
their
dwellings
housen
they
also
use
the
hire
for
hear
the
word
bowssen
too
is
very
frequently
heard
in
these
parts
it
is
a
provincialism
for
a
stall
or
shed
where
oxen
are
kept
boose
is
the
word
from
which
it
originally
sprang
a
very
expressive
phrase
in
common
use
is

that
are
in

use
amongst
all
classes
are
as
sure
as
god
in

and
is

in

cotswold
barley
the
former
has
reference
to

houses

to

man

the
time
of
day
with
him
anything
queer

is

a

tuer
in
gloucestershire
vernacular
another
local
word
i
have
not
heard
elsewhere
is
eckle
meaning
a
green
woodpecker
or
yaffel
the
original
spelling
of
the
word
was
in
these
days
of
education
the
real
dialect
is
seldom
heard
among
the
older
peasants
a
few
are
to
be
found
who
speak
it
but
in
twenty
years
time
it
will
be
a
thing
of
the
past
the
incessant
use
of
do
and
did
and
the
changing
of
into
are
two
great
characteristics
of
the
gloucestershire
talk
being
anxious
to
be
initiated
into
the
mysteries
of
the
dialect
i
buttonholed
a
labouring
friend
of
mine
the
other
day
and
asked
him
to
try
to
teach
it
to
me
he
is
a
great
exponent
of
the
language
of
the
country
and
like
a
good
many
others
of
his
type
he
is
as
well
satisfied
with
his
pronunciation
as
he
is
with
his
other
accomplishments
the
fact
is
that
his
favourite
sin
is
pride
that
apes
humility
it
is
grammar
not
his
which
is
at
fault
in
the
following
verses
will
be
found
the
gist
of
what
he
told
me
if
thee
true
would
know
i
tell
thee
how
us
always
zays
un
put
for
and
for
on
every
possible
occasion
when
in
doubt
squeeze
in
a
not
and
do
forget
zur
that
must
stand
for
and
for
and
put
for
for
put
and
we
change
to
so
dry
an
kip
this
in
thine
yead
an
thou
talk
as
plain
as
we
the
student
in
the
language
of
the
cotswolds
should
study
a
very
ancient
song
entitled
george
ridler
oven
strange
to
say
there
is
little
or
nothing
in
it
about
the
oven
but
a
good
deal
of
the
old
gloucestershire
talk
may
be
gleaned
from
it
it
begins
like
this
george
ridler
oven
a
right
famous
old
gloucestershire
ballad
the
stwuns
the
stwuns
the
stwuns
the
stwuns
the
stwuns
the
stwuns
the
stwuns
this
is
sung
like
the
prelude
to
a
grand
orchestral
performance
beginning
somewhat
softly
hodge
fires
away
with
a
gravity
and
emotion
which
do
him
infinite
credit
each
succeeding
repetition
of
the
word
stwuns
being
rendered
with
pathos
and
emphasis
until
like
the
final
burst
of
an
orchestral
prelude
with
drums
trumpets
fiddles
etc
all
going
at
the
same
time
are
at
length
ushered
in
the
opening
lines
of
the
ballad

such
the
song
itself
is
as
old
as
the
hills
but
i
have
taken
the
liberty
of
appending
a
glossary
in
order
that
my
readers
may
be
spared
the
trouble
of
making
out
the
meaning
of
some
of
the
words
it
was
a
long
time
before
it
dawned
upon
me
that
vouled
earms
meant
folded
arms
auverdrow
likewise
was
very
perplexing
like
many
of
the
old
ballads
it
sounds
like
a
rigmarole
from
beginning
to
end
but
there
is
really
a
great
deal
more
in
it
than
meets
the
eye
george
ridler
is
no
less
a
personage
than
king
charles
and
the
oven
represents
the
cavalier
party
see
appendix
such
songs
as
these
are
deeply
interesting
from
the
fact
that
they
are
handed
down
by
oral
tradition
from
father
to
son
and
written
copies
are
never
seen
in
the
villages
the
same
applies
to
the
play
the
mummers
act
at
all
has
to
be
learnt
from
the
preceding
generation
of
country
folk
but
the
great
feature
of
our
smoking
concerts
and
village
entertainments
has
always
been
the
reading
of
tom
peregrine
this
noted
sportsman
who
writes
one
of
the
best
hands
i
ever
saw
has
kindly
copied
out
a
recitation
he
lately
gave
us
it
relates
to
the
adventures
of
one
roger
plowman
a
cotswold
man
who
went
to
london
and
is
taken
from
a
book
compiled
some
years
ago
by
some
ciceter
men
entitled
roger
plowman
excursion
to
london
it
was
read
at
a
harvest
home
given
by
old
mr
peregrine
in
his
huge
barn
an
entertainment
which
lasted
from
six
till
twelve
i
trust
none
of
my
readers
will
be
any
the
worse
for
reading
it
tom
peregrine
declares
that
when
he
first
gave
it
at
a
penny
reading
some
years
ago
one
or
two
of
the
audience
had
to
be
carried
out
in
hysterics
they
laughed
so
much
and
another
man
fell
backwards
off
his
chair
owing
to
the
extreme
comicality
of
it
the
truth
is
our
versatile
keeper
is
a
wonderful
reader
and
speaking
as
he
does
the
true
gloucestershire
accent
in
the
same
way
as
some
of
the
squires
spoke
it
a
century
or
more
ago
it
is
extremely
amusing
to
hear
him
copying
the
still
broader
dialect
of
the
labouring
class
he
has
a
tremendous
sense
of
humour
and
his
epithet
for
anything
amusing
is
foolish
is
a
splendid
tale
is
so
desperate
foolish
he
would
often
say

another
story
tom
peregrine
is
fond
of
reading
to
us
relates
how
a
labouring
man
was
recommended
to
get
some
oxtail
soup
to
strengthen
him
he
goes
into
the
town
and
sees
oxikali
soap
written
up
on
a
shop
window
he
buys
a
cake
of
it
makes
his
wife
boil
it
up
in
the
pot
and
then
proceeds
to
drink
it
for
his
health
when
he
has
taken
a
spoonful
or
two
and
found
it
very
unpleasant
his
wife
makes
him
finish
it
up
saying
it
is
sure
to
do
him
good
and
she
consoles
him
with
the
assurance
that
all
medicine
is
nasty
at
the
harvest
home
in
the
big
barn
after
the
applause
which
followed
tom
peregrine
recitation
had
died
away
a
sturdy
carter
stood
up
and
sang
a
very

on

time
passes
quickly
for
the
sportsman
who
has
the
good
fortune
to
dwell
in
the
merry
cotswolds
spring
gives
place
to
summer
and
autumn
to
winter
with
a
rapidity
which
astonishes
us
as
the
years
roll
on
so
diversified
are
the
amusements
that
each
season
brings
round
that
no
time
of
year
lacks
its
own
characteristic
sport
in
the
spring
ere
red
coats
and
leathers
are
laid
aside
by
the
squire
there
is
the
best
of
to
be
enjoyed
in
the
coln
and
windrush
streams
dear
to
the
heart
of
the
accomplished
expert
with
the
dry
fly
in
spring
too
are
the
local
hunt
races
at
oaksey
and
sherston
at
and
andoversford
pleasant
little
country
gatherings
are
these
race
meetings
albeit
the
hunter
has
little
chance
of
distinguishing
himself
between
the
flags
in
any
part
of
england
nowadays
the
lechlade
horse
show
too
is
a
great
institution
in
the
country
at
the
close
of
the
hunting
season
annually
at
whitsuntide
for
very
many
centuries
sports
have
been
held
in
all
parts
of
the
country
it
is
said
that
they
are
the
of
the
romans
included
in
these
sports
are
many
of
those
amusements
of
the
middle
ages
of
which
ben
jonson
sang
the
cotswold
with
the
olympic
vies
in
manly
games
and
goodly
exercise
is
a
great
feature
in
the
programme
of
these
whitsuntide
festivities
the
carnival
among
the
trout
together
with
lots
of
cricket
matches
make
the
time
pass
all
too
quickly
for
those
who
spend
the
glorious
summer
months
in
the
cotswolds
by
the
time
the
cirencester
horse
show
is
over
the
cubs
are
getting
strong
and
mischievous
directly
the
corn
is
cut
the
hounds
are
out
again
in
the
lovely
september
mornings
by
this
time
partridges
are
plentiful
and
must
be
shot
ere
they
get
too
wild
so
year
by
year
the
ball
is
kept
rolling
in
the
quiet
cotswold
hills
the
days
go
by
yet
content
reigns
amongst
all
classes
far
from
the
madding
crowd
ignoble
strife
their
sober
wishes
never
learned
to
stray
along
the
cool
sequestered
vale
of
life
they
kept
the
noiseless
tenor
of
their
way
then
there
is
so
much
to
do
indirectly
connected
with
sport
of
all
kinds
if
you
live
in
a
cotswold
village
woods
and
fox
coverts
must
be
kept
in
good
order
so
that
there
may
always
be
cover
to
shelter
game
and
foxes
cricket
grounds
afford
unlimited
scope
for
labour
and
experiment
if
you
either
own
or
rent
a
trout
stream
there
is
no
end
to
the
improvements
that
can
be
made
with
a
little
time
and
labour
deep
holes
or
even
lakes
may
be
dug
great
stones
and
fir
poles
may
be
utilised
to
form
eddies
and
waterfalls
and
homes
for
the
trout
by
means
of
a
little
stocking
with
fresh
blood
a
stream
may
often
be
turned
from
a
worthless
piece
of
water
into
a
splendid
fishery
there
is
no
limit
to
the
articles
of
food
which
can
be
imported
gammari
or
shrimps
caddis
and
larvae
and
various
species
of
weeds
which
nourish
insects
and
snails
notably
the
from
loch
leven
may
all
be
procured
and
transplanted
to
your
water
the
beautiful
springs
which
feed
the
coln
at
various
intervals
where
the
watercress
grows
freely
would
be
of
great
service
in
forming
lakes
there
is
so
much
poor
marshy
land
even
in
the
fertile
valleys
that
might
be
utilised
with
advantage
and
profit
for
the
purpose
of
trout
preserving
talking
of
watercress
this
is
a
branch
of
farming
which
appears
to
be
somewhat
neglected
on
the
banks
of
the
coln
the
villagers
tell
you
that
watercress
like
the
oyster
is
good
in
every
month
with
an
r
in
it
so
that
all
through
the
year
save
in
may
june
july
and
august
watercress
may
be
picked
and
sent
to
market
but
the
proprietor
of
watercress
beds
attaches
little
importance
to
the
fact
that
he
possesses
large
beds
of
this
wholesome
and
reproductive
plant
and
you
will
not
see
it
on
his
table
once
in
a
month
of
sundays
in
london
one
eats
watercress
all
the
year
round
more
especially
in
the
months
without
an
r
but
it
does
not
come
from
the
cotswolds
there
is
not
much
covert
shooting
on
these
hills
the
country
is
so
open
and
the
coverts
so
small
and
deficient
in
underwood
that
pheasant
preserving
on
a
large
scale
is
not
practicable
for
this
reason
the
preservation
of
foxes
is
the
first
consideration
at
stowell
sherborne
rendcombe
barnsley
and
cirencester
as
well
as
on
a
few
other
large
estates
a
large
head
of
game
is
reared
while
foxes
are
plentiful
too
but
the
owners
and
occupiers
of
most
of
the
manors
are
content
to
rely
on
nature
to
supply
them
with
game
in
due
season
however
for
those
gunners
who
like
the
writer
are
both
unskilful
and
unambitious
the
shooting
obtained
on
the
cotswold
hills
is
very
enjoyable
in
september
from
ten
to
twenty
brace
of
partridges
are
to
be
picked
up
together
with
what
hares
a
man
cares
to
shoot
and
a
few
rabbits
then
landrails
or
corncrakes
and
last
but
not
least
an
occasional
quail
are
usually
included
in
the
bag
quails
are
rather
partial
to
this
district
during
the
first
fortnight
of
september
a
few
are
generally
shot
on
the
manor
we
frequent
on
august
this
year
we
found
a
nest
containing
five
young
quails
about
but
the
real
pleasure
connected
with
this
kind
of
sport
lies
in
the
sense
of
wildness
the
air
is
almost
as
good
a
tonic
as
that
of
the
scotch
moors
whilst
there
is
the
additional
satisfaction
of
being
at
home
in
september
instead
of
flying
away
to
the
north
and
having
to
put
up
with
all
the
discomfort
of
a
long
railway
journey
each
way
there
is
no
time
of
year
one
would
sooner
spend
at
home
on
cotswold
than
the
month
of
september
nature
is
then
at
her
best
the
cold
bleak
hills
are
clothed
with
the
warmth
of
golden
stubble
the
autumnal
haze
now
softens
the
landscape
with
those
lights
and
shades
which
add
so
much
of
loveliness
and
sense
of
mystery
to
a
hill
country
the
rich
aftermath
is
full
of
animal
life
birds
of
all
descriptions
are
less
wild
and
more
easily
observed
than
is
the
case
later
on
when
the
pastures
and
downs
have
been
thinned
by
frost
and
there
is
no
shelter
left
now
you
may
see
the
kestrels
hovering
in
mid
air
and
the
great
sluggish
heron
wending
his
ethereal
way
to
the
upper
waters
of
the
trout
stream
you
watch
him
till
he
drops
suddenly
from
the
heavens
to
alight
in
the
little
valley
which
lies
a
short
mile
away
invisible
amid
the
tablelands
occasionally
too
a
may
be
met
with
but
this
is
a
even
in
these
outlandish
parts
peregrine
falcons
are
uncommon
too
though
one
may
yet
see
a
pair
of
them
now
and
then
if
one
keeps
a
sharp
at
all
times
and
seasons
there
are
wimbrels
and
curlews
that
have
been
shot
here
during
recent
years
stuffed
and
hung
up
in
glass
cases
in
old
mr
peregrine
house
of
other
birds
which
are
becoming
scarcer
year
by
year
in
england
the
kingfishers
are
not
uncommon
in
these
parts
you
will
often
see
the
brilliant
little
fellow
dart
past
you
as
you
walk
by
the
stream
in
summer
or
dippers
are
scarce
we
have
seen
but
one
specimen
in
the
last
three
years
in
september
as
you
walk
over
the
fields
the
cotswolds
are
seen
at
their
best
somehow
or
other
a
country
never
looks
so
well
from
the
roads
as
it
appears
when
you
are
in
the
fields
the
man
who
prefers
the
high
road
had
better
not
live
in
the
cotswolds
for
these
roads
mended
as
they
are
with
limestone
in
the
more
remote
parts
of
the
district
become
terribly
sticky
in
winter
while
the
grass
fields
and
stubbles
are
generally
as
dry
as
a
bone
there
is
but
a
small
percentage
of
clay
in
the
soil
but
a
good
deal
of
lime
and
five
inches
down
is
the
hard
rock
therefore
this
light
stony
soil
never
holds
the
rain
but
allows
it
to
percolate
rapidly
through
even
as
a
sieve
when
the
sun
is
hot
after
a
frost
the
ploughs
carry
certainly
but
this
is
because
they
dry
so
quickly
they
seldom
remain
thoroughly
wet
for
any
length
of
time
consequently
in
hunting
the
feet
of
hounds
horses
and
even
of
foxes
pick
up
the
sticky
arable
soil
instead
of
splashing
through
it
and
scent
is
spoiled
thereby
doubtless
the
lime
in
the
soil
adds
to
its
stickiness
it
is
amusing
to
watch
a
fox
break
covert
and
make
his
way
over
a
plough
which
carries
he
travels
very
badly
we
have
seen
him
fail
to
jump
a
sheep
hurdle
at
the
first
attempt
fortunately
for
the
fox
the
hounds
are
also
handicapped
by
these
conditions
and
scent
is
wretched
this
might
appear
at
first
sight
to
show
that
the
scent
of
foxes
is
chiefly
given
off
from
their
feet
we
can
recall
few
occasions
on
which
a
plough
that
carried
held
a
burning
scent
but
little
though
we
know
of
the
mysteries
of
scent
it
is
generally
agreed
that
the
steaming
trail
emanates
chiefly
from
the
body
and
breath
of
a
fox
even
though
on
certain
days
there
is
no
evidence
of
any
scent
save
on
the
ground
it
is
probable
however
that
on
light
ploughlands
evaporation
is
so
great
when
the
sun
is
shining
unless
the
wind
is
sufficiently
cold
to
counteract
the
heat
of
the
sun
and
prevent
rapid
evaporation
that
all
scent
from
the
body
and
breath
of
the
fox
save
that
which
happens
to
cling
to
the
ground
is
borne
upwards
and
lost
in
the
upper
air
hounds
therefore
have
to
fall
back
on
whatever
scent
may
remain
clinging
to
the
those
occasions
of
course
excepted
when
the
great
density
or
gravity
of
the
air
prevents
scent
from
rising
and
dispersing
and
causes
it
to
hang
after
some
years
of
careful
experiment
with
the
hygrometer
and
barometer
and
after
an
intricate
investigation
of
scent
that
mysterious
matter
which
is
given
off
from
the
skin
and
breath
of
foxes
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
if
we
could
get
an
isaac
newton
to
whip
in
to
a
tom
firr
for
about
a
twelvemonth
we
might
very
likely
come
to
know
all
about
it
in
standing
on
ground
whereon
angels
fear
to
tread
i
am
fully
aware
that
i
speak
as
a
fool
but
let
me
state
that
it
is
on
the
barometer
that
i
now
place
my
somewhat
limited
reliance
on
a
hunting
morning
and
not
on
the
hygrometer
on
the
weight
of
the
column
of
air
on
a
given
point
of
the
surface
of
the
earth
rather
than
on
the
state
of
the
evaporations
the
relative
humidity
and
the
dew
point
and
i
have
noticed
that
the
best
scenting
days
have
been
those
when
the
thermometer
has
given
readings
from
up
to
fahrenheit
in
the
shade
a
high
and
steady
glass
an
almost
imperceptible
east
or
wind
with
the
ground
soaked
with
moisture
and
no
frost
during
the
previous
night
is
the
only
combination
of
conditions
under
which
scent
on
the
grass
is
a
moral
certainty
on
the
other
hand
a
low
and
unsteady
glass
a
warm
gusty
south
or
west
wind
with
a
hot
sun
following
a
frost
or
a
day
with
cold
showers
with
bright
sunny
intervals
or
during
the
afternoon
but
not
always
the
morning
before
a
storm
of
wind
or
rain
such
are
the
conditions
which
make
so
many
of
our
attempts
to
hunt
the
fox
by
scent
a
miserable
farce
yet
even
on
these
days
hounds
may
run
during
some
part
of
the
day
when
the
barometer
is
thoroughly
unsettled
there
may
be
light
local
currents
perfectly
imperceptible
to
man
yet
felt
by
cows
and
sheep
currents
created
like
winds
by
a
variation
of
temperature
in
different
parts
of
any
given
field
and
which
will
scatter
the
scent
and
spoil
the
sport
these
currents
rapid
evaporation
combined
with
a
lack
of
steady
atmospheric
pressure
and
that
sticky
state
of
soil
which
on
ploughed
land
invariably
follows
a
frost
and
in
a
lesser
degree
affects
grass
causing
a
fox
to
take
his
pad
scent
on
with
him
all
the
particles
that
do
not
cling
to
the
ground
having
been
diffused
and
lost
in
the
air
these
are
the
curses
of
modern
hunting
fields
and
the
chief
causes
of
bad
scenting
days
after
september
is
past
the
shooting
man
will
not
get
very
much
sport
on
the
cotswolds
as
far
as
the
partridges
are
concerned
for
they
are
not
numerous
enough
to
be
worth
driving
they
soon
become
as
wild
as
they
can
possibly
be
on
hatherop
and
some
other
estates
good
partridge
driving
is
enjoyed
the
farmers
are
very
fond
of
shooting
them
under
a
kite
this
as
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
explain
is
an
artificial
representation
of
the
hawk
it
is
flown
high
up
in
the
air
at
some
distance
ahead
of
the
guns
the
birds
seeing
what
they
take
to
be
a
very
large
and
hawk
hovering
above
them
ready
to
pounce
down
at
a
moment
notice
become
frightened
and
lie
crouching
in
the
hedges
and
turnips
until
they
almost
have
to
be
kicked
up
by
the
sportsmen
but
when
once
they
do
get
up
they
fly
straight
away
nor
do
they
come
back
for
a
long
time
this
mode
of
shooting
is
all
very
well
once
in
a
way
but
if
indulged
in
habitually
it
scares
the
birds
driving
them
on
to
other
manors
not
having
seen
it
successfully
carried
out
we
are
not
fond
of
the
method
but
there
are
good
sportsmen
in
these
parts
who
advocate
it
some
maintain
that
this
can
not
be
called
a
really
sportsmanlike
way
of
shooting
partridges
though
there
is
doubtless
room
for
two
opinions
on
the
question
later
on
in
the
autumn
when
november
frosts
begin
to
attract
snipes
to
the
withybeds
and
water
meadows
by
the
coln
the
unambitious
gunner
may
often
enjoy
the
charm
of
a
small
and
select
mixed
bag
two
of
us
went
out
for
an
hour
last
winter
before
breakfast
having
been
informed
that
a
woodcock
was
lying
in
an
ash
copse
by
the
river
we
got
the
woodcock
a
somewhat
in
small
isolated
coverts
on
the
hills
in
addition
the
bag
contained
one
snipe
one
wild
duck
two
pheasants
six
rabbits
a
pigeon
a
heron
and
some
moorhens
now
this
was
very
good
sport
because
it
was
totally
unexpected
the
majority
of
shooting
people
might
not
think
much
of
so
small
a
bag
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
charm
of
this
kind
of
shooting
is
its
wildness
it
seems
rather
hard
to
kill
herons
but
anybody
who
has
tried
to
preserve
trout
will
agree
that
herons
are
the
greatest
enemies
with
which
the
has
to
contend
one
heron
will
clear
a
shallow
stream
in
a
very
short
time
when
the
floods
are
out
trout
fall
a
ready
prey
to
these
rapacious
birds
the
kingfishers
likewise
have
a
very
good
time
the
fish
will
gorge
themselves
with
worms
picked
up
on
the
inundated
meadows
until
they
are
so
full
that
the
worms
actually
begin
falling
out
of
their
mouths
i
picked
several
up
last
autumn
which
had
been
stabbed
i
suppose
by
a
heron
they
were
unharmed
save
for
a
small
round
hole
as
if
made
by
a
bullet
there
was
no
other
mark
on
them
but
when
taken
up
the
worms
came
out
of
their
mouths
by
the
score
kingfishers
are
carefully
preserved
in
spite
of
their
destructiveness
but
one
must
draw
the
line
at
herons
waiting
for
wild
duck
coming
into
the
spring
on
a
frosty
night
is
cold
work
but
very
good
fun
they
breed
here
in
fair
numbers
and
fly
away
in
august
but
when
the
ground
becomes
scrumpety
as
the
natives
say
with
the
first
severe
frost
back
they
come
from
the
frozen
meres
to
their
old
home
and
if
one
can
keep
out
of
sight
and
this
is
no
easy
matter
in
december
many
a
shot
can
be
obtained
in
the
withybeds
by
the
river
teal
and
widgeon
may
be
shot
occasionally
in
the
same
manner
sometimes
when
you
are
upon
the
hills
with
tom
peregrine
the
keeper
trying
to
pick
up
a
brace
or
two
of
partridges
for
the
house
he
will
suddenly
say
down
then
throwing
himself
on
to
his
hands
and
knees
in
breathless
anxiety
he
will
begin
whistling
for
all
he
knows
you
imitate
him
to
the
best
of
your
ability
and
soon
if
you
are
lucky
an
enormous
flock
of
golden
plover
flash
over
you
four
barrels
are
fired
almost
instantaneously
and
the
deadly
of
your
companion
is
seldom
fired
in
vain
green
plover
or
lapwings
are
numerous
enough
on
the
cotswolds
they
are
wonderfully
difficult
to
circumvent
nevertheless
you
crouch
down
under
a
wall
while
your
men
go
ever
so
far
round
to
drive
them
to
you
but
it
is
the
rarest
thing
in
the
world
to
bag
one
their
eggs
are
very
difficult
to
find
in
the
breeding
season
it
is
the
male
bird
that
like
a
terrified
and
anxious
mother
flies
round
and
round
you
with
piteous
cries
the
female
bird
when
disturbed
flies
straight
away
with
decoys
is
a
very
favourite
amusement
among
the
cotswold
farmers
they
manage
to
bag
an
enormous
quantity
in
a
hard
winter
sometimes
getting
over
a
hundred
in
a
day
come
in
thousands
to
the
stubble
fields
when
the
beech
nuts
have
come
to
an
end
large
flocks
of
them
annually
migrate
to
england
from
northern
europe
crouching
in
a
hedge
or
under
a
wall
you
may
enjoy
as
pretty
a
sport
as
ever
fell
to
the
lot
of
mortal
man
a
few
dead
birds
are
placed
on
the
stubble
to
attract
the
flocks
and
a
grand
variety
of
flying
shots
may
be
obtained
as
the
fly
over
the
year
was
remarkable
for
this
shooting
between
november
and
two
of
our
farmers
killed
close
on
a
thousand
of
these
birds
some
of
them
doubtless
were
potted
on
the
ground
tom
peregrine
remarked
that
he
never
saw
such
a
sight
of
dead
pigeons
the
up
at
the
farm
was
full
of
them
the
vast
flocks
that
blacken
the
skies
for
a
few
short
weeks
in
november
disappear
as
suddenly
as
they
come
after
november
they
are
no
more
seen
there
would
be
many
more
partridges
were
it
not
for
the
rooks
and
magpies
hedges
wherein
the
birds
can
hide
their
nests
are
few
and
far
between
in
the
wall
country
so
the
rook
spies
out
many
a
nest
in
the
spring
of
the
year
for
this
reason
and
because
they
eat
the
corn
the
farmers
hate
them
we
can
not
share
their
feelings
we
should
be
sorry
to
see
the
old
rookery
in
the
garden
diminished
in
the
slightest
degree
jays
and
magpies
are
terribly
numerous
they
are
rare
we
have
seen
as
many
as
twelve
of
the
latter
lately
flying
all
together
magpies
are
difficult
to
get
at
they
will
sit
perched
upon
the
topmost
twigs
of
the
trees
but
will
invariably
fly
away
before
you
get
within
shot
it
is
interesting
to
rear
a
few
pheasants
annually
there
is
no
bird
which
gives
more
delight
even
if
fairly
tame
their
beautiful
colouring
and
cheerful
crowing
are
always
pleasant
in
the
garden
and
woods
around
your
house
if
you
feed
them
every
day
they
will
come
regularly
up
to
the
very
door
and
with
them
come
the
swans
waddling
up
from
the
water
looking
very
much
out
of
their
element
sometimes
too
a
moorhen
will
join
the
party
whilst
two
little
wild
ducks
the
sole
survivors
of
a
brood
of
sixteen
which
were
attacked
and
killed
by
a
stoat
will
take
food
right
out
of
the
mouths
of
the
old
swans
peacocks
i
would
not
care
to
have
round
the
house
but
there
is
nothing
more
in
touch
with
english
country
life
than
the
glorious
red
green
and
brown
colouring
of
a
fine
cock
pheasant
strutting
proudly
across
the
lawn
on
his
way
to
his
in
the
firs
contrasting
as
he
does
with
the
majestic
form
and
snowy
plumage
of
the
stately
swans
which
glide
about
the
silent
coln
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
the
incarnation
of
grace
and
symmetry
truly
some
of
the
most
common
of
animals
are
also
the
most
beautiful
besides
the
rooks
there
is
another
bird
which
the
farmers
love
to
wage
incessant
war
upon
the
other
day
i
received
the
following
message
printed
on
the
back
of
a
postcard
a
meeting
will
be
held
at
the
swan
hotel
bibury
on
friday
november
at
to
arrange
about
starting
a
for
the
district
is
a
sparrow
club
i
anxiously
enquired
the
other
day
of
a
labouring
man
a
particular
friend
of
mine
whom
i
happened
to
fall
in
with
on
his
way
to
chapel
he
answered
that
it
was
a
club
for
killing
sparrows
when
they
get
too
numerous
paying
boys
a
farthing
a
head
for
every
bird
they
catch
and
giving
prizes
for
the
greatest
number
killed
boys
may
often
be
seen
out
at
night
with
long
poles
and
nets
attached
to
them
catching
sparrows
in
the
trees
but
my
friend
tells
me
that
the
way
he
likes
to
catch
them
is
to
go
into
a
barn
at
night
with
a
lantern
you
must
hold
the
lantern
under
your
coat
so
as
to
half
screen
the
light
and
the
birds
will
fly
at
the
light
and
settle
on
your
shoulders
he
tells
me
you
can
pick
them
off
your
clothes
by
the
dozen
i
have
never
tried
it
certainly
as
personally
i
have
no
quarrel
with
the
sparrows
i
was
disappointed
that
the
sparrow
club
for
which
a
great
public
meeting
had
to
be
convened
was
not
of
a
more
exciting
nature
one
was
led
to
believe
by
the
importance
of
the
printed
postcard
that
some
good
old
english
custom
was
about
to
be
revived
a
farmer
has
just
brought
me
in
a
peregrine
falcon
that
he
shot
this
morning
he
is
of
course
very
proud
of
the
achievement
it
is
useless
to
argue
with
him
on
the
question
of
preserving
birds
that
are
becoming
scarce
in
england
he
considers
that
a
such
as
this
which
is
here
and
gone
is
a
prize
which
does
not
often
fall
to
the
lot
of
the
gunner
it
must
be
bagged
at
all
hazards
nor
is
it
easy
to
answer
the
argument
which
he
seldom
fails
to
put
forth
that
if
he
does
shoot
it
somebody
else
will
talking
of
rare
birds
i
shall
never
forget
seeing
a
wild
swan
come
sailing
up
the
coln
during
a
very
hard
frost
two
years
ago
two
of
us
were
out
after
wild
duck
and
it
was
a
grand
sight
to
watch
this
magnificent
bird
winging
his
way
rapidly
up
stream
at
a
height
of
about
fifty
yards
it
is
rare
indeed
to
see
them
in
these
parts
though
the
vicar
of
bibury
tells
me
that
seven
wild
swans
were
once
seen
on
the
coln
near
that
village
but
this
was
some
years
ago
on
the
same
authority
i
learn
that
a
solan
goose
or
gannet
has
been
known
to
visit
this
stream
tom
peregrine
shot
one
a
few
years
back
also
a
puffin
a
bird
with
a
beak
and
of
the
auk
tribe
wild
geese
frequently
pass
over
us
following
the
course
of
the
stream
on
a
bright
warm
day
in
october
such
a
day
as
we
usually
have
a
score
or
more
of
in
the
course
of
our
english
autumn
it
is
pleasant
to
take
one
gun
and
leaving
behind
the
quiet
peaceful
valley
and
the
houses
of
the
cotswold
hamlet
to
ascend
the
hill
and
seek
the
great
rolling
downs
a
couple
of
miles
away
from
any
sign
of
human
habitation
you
may
get
a
shot
at
a
partridge
or
a
as
you
go
hares
you
might
shoot
if
you
cared
to
in
every
field
but
on
the
other
hand
you
will
be
equally
well
pleased
if
your
gun
is
not
fired
off
for
it
is
peace
and
quiet
that
you
are
really
in
search
of
the
noise
of
a
shot
and
the
jar
of
a
gun
do
not
suit
your
present
mood
after
walking
for
half
an
hour
you
come
to
a
bit
of
high
ground
where
you
have
often
stood
before
and
resting
your
gun
against
a
wall
you
gaze
at
the
view
beyond
quocunque
adspicias
nihil
est
nisi
gramen
et
aer
nothing
particularly
striking
perhaps
is
visible
to
the
eye
yet
to
my
mind
there
is
a
charm
about
it
which
the
pen
is
quite
unable
to
describe
below
is
a
wide
expanse
of
undulating
downland
divided
into
fields
by
means
of
loose
uncemented
walls
of
grey
stone
the
grass
is
green
for
the
time
of
year
and
scattered
about
are
horses
cattle
and
sheep
contentedly
nibbling
the
short
fine
turf
in
the
midst
of
mile
upon
mile
of
rolling
downs
stands
forth
prominently
one
field
of
plough
of
the
richest
brown
hue
whilst
six
miles
away
a
long
belt
of
tall
trees
half
hidden
by
haze
marks
the
outline
of
stowell
park
save
for
one
homestead
miles
away
on
the
right
nothing
else
is
in
sight
it
is
past
five
and
the
sun
which
has
been
shining
brightly
all
day
with
that
genial
warmth
which
one
only
fully
appreciates
as
the
winter
approaches
is
beginning
to
descend
it
is
the
lights
and
shades
which
play
over
this
wide
stretch
of
open
country
which
makes
the
landscape
look
so
beautiful
and
when
the
wreaths
of
white
woolly
clouds
begin
to
glow
round
their
furthermost
edges
like
coals
of
fire
on
a
frosty
night
with
all
the
promise
of
a
brilliant
sunset
this
stretch
of
hill
and
plain
wears
an
aspect
which
once
seen
you
will
never
forget
it
takes
your
thoughts
away
into
the
great
unknown
the
infinite
that
mysterious
world
which
is
ever
around
us
and
which
seems
nearer
when
we
are
looking
at
a
beautiful
sunset
or
a
beautiful
view
than
at
any
other
time
in
this
life
save
for
ought
we
know
during
the
last
few
moments
of
our
earthly
existence
and
although
no
human
habitation
is
anywhere
to
be
seen
the
air
is
full
of
the
spirits
of
bygone
generations
and
of
bygone
of
men
there
are
traces
of
humanity
in
all
directions
wherever
your
eye
may
gaze
but
they
are
the
traces
of
a
forgotten
people
yonder
semicircular
ridge
was
once
the
rampart
of
an
ancient
british
town
though
save
in
the
tangled
copse
hard
by
where
the
plough
has
never
been
at
work
it
is
fast
disappearing
many
a
stone
lying
about
the
camp
bears
unmistakable
marks
of
fire
a
glance
of
the
eye
westwards
and
your
thoughts
are
carried
back
to
the
roman
invasion
for
scarce
five
miles
off
lies
the
ancient
roman
villa
of
chedworth
then
again
tradition
has
it
that
a
mile
away
from
this
spot
and
close
to
the
old
manor
house
skirmishes
were
fought
in
later
days
at
the
time
the
civil
wars
were
raging
when
many
a
chivalrous
cavalier
and
many
a
stern
unbending
puritan
lay
dead
on
yonder
field
or
maybe
was
carried
into
the
old
house
to
linger
and
to
die
in
the
very
room
in
which
you
slept
last
night
everywhere
in
england
are
battlefields
but
they
are
in
the
words
of
de
quincey
battlefields
that
nature
has
long
ago
reconciled
to
herself
with
the
sweet
oblivion
of
flowers
this
very
mound
on
which
you
are
standing
is
it
not
the
of
a
race
which
dwelt
on
the
cotswolds
full
three
thousand
years
ago
and
were
not
human
remains
found
here
a
few
years
back
when
this
in
common
with
many
other
barrows
hard
by
was
opened
and
an
underground
chamber
discovered
therein
the
earthly
of
the
bones
of
the
unknown
dead
the
silence
of
deep
eternities
of
worlds
from
beyond
the
morning
stars
does
it
not
speak
to
thee
the
unborn
ages
the
old
graves
with
their
dust
the
very
tears
that
wetted
it
now
all
dry
do
not
these
speak
to
thee
what
ear
hath
not
heard
solemn
before
us
veiled
the
dark
portal
goal
of
all

stars
silent
rest

graves
under

silent
well
has
carlyle
translated
the
great
german
poet
and
the
old
barrows
that
lie
scattered
over
these
downs
are
not
dumb
they
are
continually
speaking
to
us
of
those
things
which
ear
hath
not
heard
and
at
no
time
have
they
more
to
tell
than
at
the
close
of
a
mild
peaceful
day
in
october
when
all
else
save
for
the
faint
tinkling
of
the
distant
is
silent
as
death
and
the
sun
ere
once
more
disappearing
is
shedding
a
solemn
glow
over
the
deserted
mysterious
uplands
of
the
cotswold
hills
but
the
partridges
are
calling
all
around
and
a
covey
actually
passes
over
your
head
your
sporting
instincts
begin
to
revive
and
you
take
up
your
gun
and
proceed
to
stalk
that
covey
stealing
round
under
a
wall
then
you
suddenly
remember
that
the
hounds
meet
in
your
village
and
you
begin
wondering
whether
they
will
once
again
find
the
great
dog
fox
that
several
times
last
season
led
you
over
the
wide
open
country
that
now
lies
mapped
out
before
you
fox
too
one
of
a
litter
you
came
upon
two
springs
ago
in
a
little
spinney
not
half
a
mile
from
where
you
are
standing
now
and
of
the
greyhound
stamp
fleet
of
foot
and
lithe
of
limb
each
time
the
hounds
had
come
to
draw
he
was
at
home
in
the
covert
on
the
brow
of
the
hill
which
shelters
the
old
manor
house
you
inhabit
from
the
cold
blast
of
winter
here
he
loved
to
dwell
and
hunt
moorhens
and
dabchicks
and
all
night
long
by
the
banks
of
silvery
coln
but
on
three
occasions
within
six
weeks
no
sooner
did
the
hounds
enter
the
wood
than
a
shrill
scream
proclaimed
him
away
on
the
far
side
you
were
mounted
on
a
good
horse
and
were
away
as
soon
as
the
pack
and
then
for
thirty
minutes
the
old
customer
cantered
away
over
those
broad
pastures
hounds
and
horses
tearing
after
him
on
a
scent
but
never
gaining
an
inch
of
ground
two
leagues
were
quickly
traversed
ere
yonder
distant
belt
of
trees
was
reached
where
the
dry
leaves
lay
rotting
on
the
ground
and
there
was
not
an
atom
of
scent
so
he
saved
his
life
and
the
tired
sportsmen
vow
that
there
never
was
such
a
run
seen
before
so
thrilling
is
the
ecstasy
of
pace
and
so
enchanting
the
stride
of
a
horse
is
a
wild
deserted
tract
of
country
that
stretches
from
cirencester
right
away
to
the
north
of
warwickshire
for
fifty
miles
you
might
gallop
on
across
those
undulating
fields
and
meet
no
human
being
on
your
way
we
have
ridden
forty
miles
on
end
along
the
fosseway
and
save
in
the
curious
old
towns
of
and
we
scarcely
met
a
soul
on
the
journey
what
a
marvellous
work
was
that
old
roman
fosseway
raised
high
above
the
level
of
the
adjoining
fields
it
runs
literally
as
straight
as
an
arrow
through
the
heart
of
the
grassy
midlands
and
what
a
rare
hunting
country
it
passes
through
we
saw
but
one
short
piece
of
barbed
wire
in
our
journey
of
over
forty
miles
now
that
farming
is
no
longer
remunerative
the
whole
country
seems
to
be
given
up
to
hunting
depend
upon
it
it
is
this
sport
alone
that
circulates
money
through
this
deserted
land
time
was
when
the
uplands
of
gloucestershire
were
almost
entirely
under
the
plough
when
good
scenting
days
seldom
gladdened
the
heart
of
the
hunting
man
and
when
in
a
ride
over
the
cotswold
tableland
the
excitement
of
a
fast
gallop
on
grass
was
an
impossibility
those
were
the
days
when
land
at
thirty
shillings
an
acre
was
eagerly
sought
after
and
the
wheat
crop
amply
repaid
those
who
cultivated
it
now
alas
farms
are
to
be
had
for
the
asking
rent
free
but
nobody
will
take
them
and
the
country
is
rapidly
going
back
to
its
original
uncultivated
state
the
farmer
nevertheless
does
not
lose
heart
to
lay
down
such
light
land
into
permanent
pasture
does
not
pay
it
is
therefore
left
to
its
own
devices
with
the
result
that
in
a
short
time
weeds
and
moss
and
rough
grasses
spring
up
less
unprofitable
than
ploughed
fields
and
almost
as
favourable
for
hunting
the
fox
as
the
fair
pastures
of
the
vale
of
aylesbury
however
nihil
est
ab
omni
parte
beatum
there
are
other
things
to
be
done
in
this
life
besides
riding
across
country
in
the
wake
of
the
flying
pack
glorious
and
exhilarating
though
the
pastime
be
and
the
sooner
these
great
wastes
of
unprolific
land
are
once
more
transformed
into
plough
the
better
will
it
be
for
all
of
us
so
you
stroll
dreamily
homewards
musing
on
these
things
and
wondering
whether
you
will
have
another
glorious
gallop
you
will
just
go
round
by
that
spinney
to
see
if
the
earth
you
gave
orders
to
be
stopped
up
is
properly
closed
but
stop
what
is
that
lying
curled
up
under
the
wall
not
ten
yards
off
see
he
stirs
he
rises
lazily
and
looks
round
is
the
very
fox
long
and
lean
and
wiry
is
he
fine
drawn
and
sleek
as
a
trained
racehorse
with
a
brush
nearly
two
feet
long
brown
as
the
ploughed
field
you
were
looking
at
just
now
save
for
the
tip
of
his
brush
which
is
white
as
snow
he
trots
off
along
the
wall
offering
the
easiest
of
broadside
shots
if
you
were
villain
enough
to
take
advantage
of
it
he
does
not
hurry
he
stops
and
looks
round
after
a
bit
as
much
as
to
say
i
trust
you
but
when
you
steal
cautiously
towards
him
he
once
more
lollops
along
you
follow
to
see
where
he
goes
to
when
he
has
jumped
over
the
high
wall
into
the
next
field
but
he
does
not
jump
over
but
the
wall
and
there
he
sits
looking
at
you
until
you
are
once
more
nearly
up
to
him
then
he
disappears
the
other
side
and
you
run
up
and
peep
over
he
is
nowhere
to
be
seen
you
look
along
the
wall
for
a
hole
into
which
he
could
have
popped
but
in
vain
you
stoop
down
and
try
to
track
him
by
scent
and
the
mark
of
his
pad
but
all
to
no
purpose
and
from
that
day
to
this
you
have
never
discovered
what
became
of
him

sir
walter
scott
the
next
morning
you
are
up
betimes
for
the
hounds
meet
at
the
house
at
nine
you
are
not
sorry
on
looking
out
of
your
window
to
see
that
a
thick
mist
at
present
envelopes
the
country
with
the
ground
in
the
dry
state
it
is
in
this
mist
accompanied
as
it
is
by
a
heavy
dew
is
your
only
chance
of
a
scent
how
else
could
they
hunt
the
jackal
in
india
if
it
was
not
for
this
dew
thus
reflecting
you
recall
pleasant
recollections
of
gallops
over
hard
ground
with
the
bombay
hounds
and
comfort
yourself
with
the
thought
that
the
ground
here
can
not
be
as
hard
as
that
indian
soil
you
are
soon
into
your
breeches
and
boots
and
down
to
breakfast
in
the
a
large
party
is
already
assembled
for
there
are
five
men
and
two
ladies
turning
out
from
the
house
whilst
one
or
two
keen
sportsmen
have
already
put
in
an
appearance
from
afar
the
hounds
turn
up
punctual
to
the
appointed
time
how
beautiful
and
majestic
they
look
as
they
suddenly
come
into
sight
amid
beech
and
ash
and
walnut
whilst
the
bright
pageant
advances
leisurely
and
in
order
over
the
ancient
bridge
which
spans
the
silent
river
where
the
morning
mist
still
hangs
and
the
grass
shines
white
with
silvery
dew
in
good
condition
they
look
too
a
credit
to
their
huntsman
who
evidently
has
not
neglected
giving
them
plenty
of
exercise
on
the
roads
during
the
summer
you
greet
the
genial
master
then
in
answer
to
his
enquiry
as
to
where
you
would
like
him
to
draw
you
point
to
the
hanging
wood
on
the
brow
of
the
hill
and
tell
him
that
as
you
heard
them
barking
there
this
very
morning
it
is
a
certain
find
no
sooner
are
the
words
out
of
your
mouth
than
a
holloa
breaks
the
silence
of
the
early
morn
the
gardener
has
viewed
a
cub
within
a
hundred
yards
of
the
house
desperately
bold
are
the
cubs
at
this
time
of
year
before
they
have
been
hunted
their
first
experience
of
being
stopped
out
for
the
night
does
not
seem
to
have
frightened
them
at
all
they
have
been
kicking
up
a
rare
shindy
most
of
the
night
in
the
covert
close
to
the
house
alas
i
regardless
of
their
doom
the
little
victims
play
by
they
will
have
become
sadder
and
wiser
beings
several
people
will
be
glad
of
this
the
keeper
included
for
the
fowls
have
suffered
lately
there
have
also
been
one
or
two
and
carefully
thought
out
sallies
on
the
young
pheasants
without
much
damage
however
not
long
ago
a
bold
young
cub
spent
some
time
in
breaking
open
the
lid
of
one
of
the
coops
in
which
were
some
late
pheasants
he
actually
forced
the
wire
netting
from
the
roof
of
the
coop
although
it
was
firmly
nailed
to
the
woodwork
but
he
could
not
quite
get
his
head
in
for
when
the
keeper
arrived
on
the
scene
at
five
there
he
was
clawing
and
scratching
at
the
birds
his
efforts
met
with
no
success
however
for
not
a
single
bird
was
badly
injured
though
some
damage
might
have
been
done
if
master
reynard
had
not
been
interrupted
at
this
critical
moment
young
cubs
are
like
puppies
very
mischievous
there
are
plenty
of
rabbits
about
and
they
are
the
food
foxes
like
best
poultry
and
pheasants
are
pursued
and
killed
out
of
pure
love
of
mischief
we
must
return
to
the
hounds
our
huntsman
wisely
determines
not
to
go
to
the
holloa
for
he
prefers
to
let
the
young
entry
draw
for
their
game
besides
which
if
this
cub
has
gone
away
he
is
one
of
the
right
sort
and
does
not
require
schooling
for
as
we
all
know
one
of
the
objects
of
is
to
teach
the
young
foxes
that
if
they
leave
the
covert
when
the
hounds
are
thrown
in
they
will
get
a
rare
dusting
so
the
hounds
having
been
taken
to
the
end
of
the
wood
the
huntsman
begins
drawing
steadily
down
wind
let
them
have
every
chance
now
it
will
be
quite
early
enough
to
begin
drawing
up
wind
when
the
leaf
is
off
and
reynard
has
got
a
bit
shy
blood
is
an
excellent
thing
for
young
hounds
nay
for
all
hounds
early
in
the
season
but
we
do
want
to
chop
any
cubs
before
they
know
where
they
are
or
what
it
all
means
and
soon
the
whole
valley
with
hound
music
as
the
pack
come
crashing
towards
us
through
the
thick
underwood
we
get
a
splendid
view
of
the
proceedings
for
the
covert
is
a
long
narrow
strip
of
about
ten
acres
running
in
the
shape
of
a
bow
round
the
hill
immediately
above
the
place
where
we
are
stationed
there
is
another
small
wood
of
about
the
same
size
on
the
other
side
of
the
little
valley
for
this
our
fox
makes
the
hounds
dashing
close
after
him
through
the
brook
round
and
round
they
go
and
it
is
evident
that
this
cub
unlike
several
of
his
brethren
who
have
taken
their
departure
viewed
by
the
whole
field
but
holloaed
at
does
not
intend
to
face
the
open
country
scent
is
good
in
covert
perhaps
because
there
are
at
present
few
of
those
dry
leaves
on
the
ground
that
spoil
scent
after
the
fall
of
the
leaf
the
result
is
we
kill
a
cub
this
will
be
a
lesson
to
the
rest
of
the
family
when
they
return
and
discover
the
fearful
end
that
befalls
foxes
that
hang
in
covert
another
cub
having
gone
to
ground
in
a
the
keeper
is
given
injunctions
to
have
this
hole
together
with
any
other
large
ones
he
can
find
stopped
up
after
allowing
a
day
or
two
to
pass
especially
making
sure
by
the
use
of
terriers
and
also
by
the
tracks
that
he
does
not
stop
any
cubs
in
we
now
leave
the
home
coverts
and
start
away
for
a
withybed
about
a
mile
up
the
river
where
we
are
told
there
is
a
litter
here
however
we
do
not
find
though
it
is
the
likeliest
place
in
the
world
for
a
fox
as
the
hounds
dash
into
the
withybed
a
whole
string
of
wild
ducks
get
up
circle
round
us
and
then
fly
straight
away
up
stream
in
the
shape
of
the
letter
v
a
sight
unsurpassed
if
you
happen
to
be
a
lover
of
nature
our
next
draw
is
an
isolated
artificial
gorse
of
about
six
acres
if
we
find
here
we
must
have
a
gallop
for
there
is
no
covert
of
any
size
within
a
radius
a
fine
open
country
lies
all
around
walls
to
jump
and
large
fields
of
fifty
acres
apiece
to
gallop
over
there
is
some
light
plough
but
each
year
the
plough
gets
scarcer
for
the
cotswolds
are
rapidly
being
allowed
to
tumble
back
into
grass
or
rather
into
a
great
proportion
of
the
country
hereabouts
consists
of
downs
divided
into
large
enclosures
when
the
walls
are
low
there
is
no
reason
why
the
pace
should
not
be
almost
as
good
as
it
is
in
an
unenclosed
country
happily
we
seem
to
be
in
for
a
quick
thing
for
before
the
whip
has
had
time
to
get
to
the
end
of
the
covert
hounds
are
away
without
a
sound
and
we
start
off
fully
two
hundred
yards
behind
them
the
old
fox
for
a
fiver
but
there
is
no
stopping
them
so
knowing
the
country
and
the
earth
he
is
making
for
you
make
tracks
as
hard
as
your
horse
can
pelt
in
the
direction
in
which
the
hounds
are
going
and
very
soon
they
turn
to
you
and
you
find
yourself
almost
alongside
of
them
they
are
running
mute
with
their
noses
several
inches
off
the
ground
it
almost
looks
as
if
they
had
got
a
view
of
him
but
this
is
not
the
case
scent
is
breast
high
two
old
hounds
that
you
know
well
crusty
and
governor
are
leading
though
you
are
glad
that
one
or
two
you
do
not
know
evidently
some
of
this
year
entry
are
not
far
behind
the
country
which
has
so
far
been
rather
hilly
now
opens
out
into
a
flat
tableland
you
fly
on
thankful
that
you
are
on
a
thoroughbred
and
that
he
is
in
good
condition
it
pays
well
to
keep
a
horse
up
all
the
summer
in
this
country
for
some
of
the
quickest
things
of
the
season
take
place
in
october
scent
is
often
good
at
this
time
of
the
year
because
the
fields
are
full
of
keep
there
is
plenty
of
rough
grass
about
later
on
they
will
be
pared
down
by
sheep
and
the
frost
will
make
them
as
bare
as
a
turnpike
road
then
again
that
abomination
a
carrying
plough
is
not
so
likely
to
be
met
with
in
october
the
white
frosts
are
not
severe
enough
later
on
they
are
a
constant
source
of
annoyance
to
a
huntsman
and
invariably
cause
a
check
but
your
horse
well
bred
and
fit
though
he
be
is
doing
all
he
can
to
live
with
the
hounds
fortunately
you
know
that
he
is
too
good
to
chance
a
wall
even
when
blown
at
the
pace
hounds
are
going
you
have
not
much
time
to
trot
slowly
at
the
walls
in
the
orthodox
fashion
you
must
take
them
as
they
come
high
and
low
alike
at
a
fair
pace
taking
a
pull
a
few
strides
before
your
mount
takes
off
oh
how
exhilarating
is
a
gallop
in
this
fine
cotswold
air
in
the
cool
autumnal
morning
and
what
a
splendid
view
you
get
of
hounds
here
are
no
tall
fences
to
hide
them
from
your
sight
and
to
tempt
a
fox
to
run
the
hedgerows
no
boggy
woodlands
where
your
horse
flounders
up
to
his
girths
in
yellow
clay
no
ridge
and
furrow
and
no
deep
ploughed
fields
what
is
the
charm
which
belongs
so
exclusively
to
a
fast
and
run
over
this
wild
uncultivated
region
it
does
not
lie
in
the
successful
negotiation
of
leicestershire
oxers
aylesbury
doubles
or
warwickshire
fences
for
there
need
be
no
obstacle
greater
than
an
occasional
stone
wall
perhaps
it
lies
partly
in
the
fact
that
in
a
run
over
a
level
country
where
the
enclosures
are
large
and
the
turf
sound
given
a
good
fox
and
a
burning
scent
hounds
and
horses
travel
at
as
great
a
pace
as
they
attain
in
any
country
in
england
here
moreover
if
anywhere
is
to
be
found
the
greatest
happiness
for
the
greatest
number
the
maximum
of
sport
with
the
minimum
of
danger
the
fine
free
air
of
the
cotswold
plains
the
good
fellowship
engendered
when
all
can
ride
abreast
the
very
muteness
of
the
flying
pack
the
onslaught
of
a
light
brigade
or
of
a
flying
squadron
under
the
admiral
of
the
red
sailing
away
over
a
sea
of
grass
towards
a
region
almost
untrodden
by
man
the
long
sweeping
stride
of
a
horse
the
unceasing
twang
of
the
horn
to
encourage
flagging
hounds
beaten
off
by
the
pace
and
those
which
got
left
behind
at
the
start
lastly
the
can
it
last
where
will
it
all
end
shall
we
run
bang
into
him
in
the
open
or
will
he
beat
us
in
yonder
cold
scenting
woodland
standing
boldly
forth
on
the
skyline
miles
ahead
all
these
things
add
a
peculiar
fascination
to
a
fast
run
over
this
wild
country
sooner
or
later
there
is
a
sudden
check
a
couple
of
sharp
turns
and
the
spell
is
gone
hounds
may
run
back
ever
so
well
to
the
very
covert
whence
an
hour
ago
they
forced
him
the
pleasure
of
watching
them
work
out
a
scent
growing
rapidly
colder
may
indeed
be
left
to
us
but
the
glorious
possibilities
which
lasted
as
long
as
a
gallant
though
invisible
quarry
was
leading
us
from
home
into
unfamiliar
regions
have
passed
away
the
record
run
which
we
thought
had
really
commenced
at
last
far
far
into
the
unknown
land
into
the
country
leading
to
nowhere
is
not
yet
attained
probably
it
never
will
be
for
it
existed
in
the
human
imagination
alone
during
that
thrilling
burst
and
was
beyond
the
compass
of
foxes
horses
and
hounds
as
a
set
off
to
this
it
must
be
admitted
that
fast
runs
do
not
take
place
every
day
on
these
hills
perhaps
there
will
not
be
more
than
half
a
dozen
clinkers
in
a
season
with
a
pack
for
this
reason
as
regards
sport
the
wall
country
can
not
compare
with
a
vale
a
stranger
might
hunt
there
for
three
weeks
in
march
and
at
the
end
of
that
time
take
himself
off
in
disappointment
and
disgust
declaring
these
runs
he
had
heard
so
much
about
to
be
an
invention
and
a
myth
and
the
wall
country
only
fit
for
fools
and
funkers
for
good
scenting
days
in
this
hill
country
are
few
and
far
between
and
a
bad
day
in
the
wall
district
is
the
poorest
fun
imaginable
for
this
the
field
have
generally
themselves
to
thank
since
they
will
not
give
the
hounds
a
chance
but
there
is
a
burning
scent
this
morning
as
there
generally
is
when
the
dew
is
just
going
off
for
minutes
hounds
do
not
check
once
the
earth
our
fox
has
been
making
for
is
fortunately
closed
this
causes
a
moment
uncertainty
among
the
hounds
but
not
a
check
for
they
drive
straight
onwards
and
it
is
evident
that
he
is
making
for
some
earths
five
miles
away
in
a
neighbouring
hunt
territory
which
instinct
tells
him
will
be
open
there
they
go
old
and
and
several
ladies
past
masters
in
the
craft
of
crossing
a
country
with
the
maximum
of
elegance
and
skill
and
the
minimum
of
risk
to
their
horses
themselves
or
their
friends
though
the
hounds
are
travelling
at
their
greatest
possible
pace
they
ride
alongside
them
looking
as
cool
as
cucumbers
too
cool
i
think
for
their
own
enjoyment
for
the
more
excitable
though
less
experienced
rider
probably
enjoys
himself
more
note
how
each
wall
varying
in
height
from
three
to
four
and
a
half
feet
is
taken
at
a
steady
pace
by
those
horses
even
a
wall
coped
with
sharp
jagged
stones
pointing
straight
upwards
does
not
turn
them
one
breadth
from
the
line
and
please
note
also
that
each
has
two
hands
on
the
reins
and
no
whip
hand
flung
high
in
the
air
or
elbows
thrust
outwards
you
gentlemen
who
are
fond
of
painting
pictures
of
hunting
scenes
for
the
press
a
good
rider
sitting
at
his
ease
on
horseback
as
if
an
angel
dropped
down
from
the
clouds
to
turn
and
wind
a
fiery
pegasus
and
witch
the
world
with
noble
horsemanship
resembles
a
skilful
musician
seated
at
a
piano
or
an
organ
there
is
the
same
kind
of
communication
between
the
man
and
the
instrument
whereby
the
stricken
chords
respond
to
the
lightest
touch
of
the
master
who
guides
as
with
a
silken
thread
the
keys
that
set
the
trembling
strings
in
motion
for
the
rider
keys
are
curb
and
snaffle
and
his
hands
by
means
of
the
bridle
control
the
sensitive
bars
of
his
mouth
the
most
harmonious
delicate
organ
yet
discovered
on
earth
but
too
often
alas
thumped
and
banged
on
to
such
an
awful
extent
by
unsympathetic
heavy
hands
as
to
become
considerably
out
of
tune
whereby
discord
occasionally
reigns
supreme
instead
of
sweet
melodious
harmony
goodness
gracious
what
up
our
horse
which
has
never
refused
before
has
stopped
dead
at
a
wall
we
stand
up
in
the
stirrups
and
peep
over
and
there
below
us
is
a
narrow
but
deep
quarry
a
veritable
death
trap
for
the
unwary
sportsman
this
is
indeed
a
merciful
escape
and
how
can
we
be
too
thankful
that
a
horse
wise
sagacious
animal
that
he
is
has
been
endowed
with
an
extraordinary
instinct
whereby
he
can
danger
even
though
he
can
not
see
it
writing
of
this
one
of
the
numerous
escapes
a
merciful
dispensation
of
providence
has
granted
us
in
the
hunting
field
we
are
reminded
that
no
less
than
five
good
men
and
true
have
been
killed
suddenly
with
the
hounds
during
the
last
eighteen
years
the
list
commences
with
george
whyte
melville
prince
of
hunting
men
who
broke
his
neck
in
a
ploughed
field
in
and
it
is
a
very
remarkable
fact
that
noel
smith
was
killed
in
on
precisely
the
same
day
the
first
thursday
of
december
as
that
on
which
whyte
melville
lost
his
life
eighteen
years
before
but
soon
after
crossing
a
road
hounds
suddenly
check
after
casting
themselves
beautifully
forward
until
they
have
completed
a
half
circle
they
throw
up
their
heads
and
look
round
for
the
huntsman
by
a
sort
of
instinct
the
result
of
previous
observation
the
foremost
riders
anticipated
that
check
and
did
not
follow
hounds
over
the
road
though
one
or
two
later
arrivals
press
forward
rather
too
eagerly
the
huntsman
who
is
not
far
off
seeing
at
a
glance
that
there
is
no
other
cause
for
checking
as
the
hounds
are
in
the
middle
of
a
large
grass
field
immediately
decides
that
the
fox
has
turned
sharp
down
wind
he
has
been
running
up
wind
all
the
way
and
casts
his
hounds
and
back
towards
the
lane
without
much
delay
and
now
to
quote
from
madden
diary
of
master
william
silence
may
be
seen
the
advantage
of
a
good
character
honestly
won
crusty
is
busy
feathering
down
the
road
and
as
he
is
an
absolutely
reliable
hound
the
rest
of
the
pack
are
not
long
in
coming
back
to
him
and
soon
cheered
by
their
huntsman
they
are
in
full
cry
again
our
fox
has
run
the
road
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile
this
manoeuvre
has
probably
saved
his
life
for
it
has
given
him
time
to
get
his
breath
back
in
addition
to
this
the
instant
reynard
turned
down
wind
the
scent
changed
from
a
very
good
one
to
a
most
indifferent
one
how
often
this
happens
in
a
run
and
it
is
one
of
the
chief
consolations
that
there
is
scarcely
a
day
throughout
the
season
on
which
a
run
is
impossible
if
only
a
fox
will
set
his
head
resolutely
just
as
in
a
ringing
run
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
consolation
in
the
thought
that
a
fox
travel
up
wind
part
of
the
it
is
evident
that
being
beaten
reynard
has
given
up
all
idea
of
going
for
the
earths
three
miles
away
he
is
beginning
like
all
tired
foxes
to
twist
and
turn
there
is
no
scent
on
the
road
the
hounds
are
therefore
laid
on
in
a
grass
field
and
feather
across
it
in
an
uncertain
sort
of
way
this
gives
an
opportunity
to
a
sportsman
who
has
just
arrived
by
the
road
to
proclaim
that
as
usual
they
are
hunting
hares
however
there
is
some
pretty
hunting
done
by
the
pack
up
a
hedgerow
and
across
a
ploughed
field
but
with
scent
growing
less
and
less
as
is
always
the
case
with
a
tired
twisting
fox
we
do
not
get
along
very
fast
hares
are
jumping
up
in
all
directions
and
a
terrible
nuisance
they
are
on
this
sort
of
occasion
that
hounds
will
stick
to
their
fox
twist
and
turn
though
he
may
in
spite
of
hares
is
a
fact
that
is
often
proved
in
this
country
when
a
lucky
view
has
once
more
put
them
on
good
terms
with
the
hunted
fox
at
a
time
when
half
the
field
have
been
crying
hare
but
when
a
fox
scent
has
gradually
diminished
until
it
tends
to
vanishing
point
it
is
useless
to
attempt
to
hunt
him
this
appears
to
be
the
case
this
morning
for
the
sun
has
scattered
the
mists
and
has
been
shining
the
last
ten
minutes
with
tremendous
vigour
we
are
glad
when
the
master
decides
to
give
it
up
for
we
hope
to
have
some
more
runs
with
this
old
fox
later
on
in
the
season
hounds
and
horses
have
had
enough
for
the
time
of
year
so
we
turn
our
horses
heads
to
the
cool
breeze
that
is
ever
present
on
the
cotswolds
making
the
climate
there
one
of
the
most
delightful
in
the
world
in
summer
and
autumn
and
as
we
ride
slowly
homeward
over
the
hill
past
golden
stubble
fields
there
is
much
that
is
picturesque
to
be
seen
on
all
sides
for
some
late
barley
is
not
yet
gathered
in
horses
drawing
great
yellow
waggons
and
cotswold
labourers
are
busy
amongst
the
sheaves
and
there
is
an
air
of
activity
and
animation
in
the
fields
that
is
absent
a
month
or
two
later
bleak
and
desolate
does
this
country
sometimes
look
in
winter
though
when
the
sun
shines
it
is
fair
enough
and
suddenly
as
we
ride
along
a
lovely
valley
is
seen
below
farmhouses
and
gabled
cottages
come
into
view
nestling
amid
stately
elms
and
beech
trees
already
touched
by
autumn
hand
as
we
gradually
descend
the
hill
everything
looks
more
beautiful
than
ever
this
morning
for
we
have
had
a
gallop
for
at
least
we
shall
be
in
a
thoroughly
good
temper
whatever
the
morrow
may
bring
forth
everything
will
appear
in
the
best
possible
light
such
an
excellent
tonic
is
a
fast
gallop
over
the
walls

banishing

a
cotswold
trout
stream
we
may
say
of
angling
as
boteler
said
of
strawberries
doubtless
god
could
have
made
a
better
berry
but
doubtless
god
never
did
and
so
if
i
might
be
judge
god
never
did
make
a
more
calm
quiet
innocent
recreation
than
angling
compleat
very
few
trout
we
have
caught
this
season
are
when
cooked
last
year
there
were
a
good
number
the
reason
probably
is
that
they
have
not
been
feeding
on
the
shrimps
or
crustaceans
owing
to
the
abundance
of
olive
duns
and
other
flies
that
have
been
on
the
water
last
winter
being
so
mild
was
very
favourable
for
the
hatching
out
of
fly
in
the
spring
a
hard
winter
doubtless
commits
sad
havoc
among
the
caddis
and
larvae
at
the
bottom
of
the
river
the
trout
not
being
able
to
get
much
fly
are
then
compelled
to
fall
back
on
the
crustaceans
the
food
in
these
limestone
rivers
is
so
plentiful
that
the
fish
are
able
to
pick
and
choose
from
a
very
varied
bill
of
fare
this
is
the
reason
they
are
so
difficult
to
catch
one
is
not
able
to
increase
the
stock
of
trout
to
any
great
extent
thereby
making
them
easier
to
catch
because
the
fish
one
introduces
into
the
water
are
apt
to
crowd
together
in
one
or
two
places
with
the
result
that
they
are
far
too
plentiful
in
the
shallows
where
there
is
little
food
and
too
scarce
in
the
deeper
water
of
the
loch
leven
trout
turned
in
two
years
ago
as
yearlings
more
than
inhabit
the
gravelly
reaches
in
consequence
they
have
grown
very
little
the
few
that
have
stayed
in
the
deeper
water
have
done
splendidly
they
are
now
about
of
a
pound
in
weight
no
fish
not
even
sea
trout
fight
so
well
as
these
bright
silvery
loch
levens
they
have
cost
us
no
end
of
casts
and
flies
already
this
season
not
yet
a
month
old
experience
proves
however
that
ordinary
or
common
brook
trout
are
the
best
for
turning
down
for
the
loch
leven
trout
require
deep
water
to
grow
to
any
size
when
a
boy
i
made
a
strange
recovery
of
an
eel
that
i
had
hooked
and
lost
three
weeks
before
i
was
fishing
with
worms
in
a
large
deep
hole
in
surrey
my
hook
was
a
salmon

with
the
feathers
clipped
off
i
hooked
what
i
believed
to
be
an
eel

he
broke

through
getting
it
entangled
in
a
stick
on
the
bottom
three
weeks
afterwards
when
fishing
in
the
same
fashion
and
in
the
same
place
the
line
got
fixed
up
on
the
bottom
i
pulled
hard
and
a
stick
came
away
on
that
stick
strange
to
say
was
entangled
my
old
gut
and
at
the
end
of
the
line
was
an
eel
of
two
pounds
weight
on
cutting
him
open
there
sure
enough
was
the
identical
clipped
salmon
fly
it
had
been
inside
that
eel
for
three
weeks
without
hurting
him
this
sounds
like
a
regular
angler
yarn
and
nobody
need
believe
it
unless
he
likes
nevertheless
it
is
perfectly
true
i
had
got
fixed
up
in
the
same
stick
that
had
broken
my
line
on
the
previous
occasion
that
fish
have
very
little
sense
of
feeling
is
proved
time
after
time
there
is
nothing
unusual
in
catching
a
jack
with
several
old
hooks
in
his
mouth
with
trout
however
the
occurrence
is
more
rare
last
season
my
brother
lost
a
fly
and
two
yards
of
gut
through
a
big
trout
breaking
his
tackle
but
two
minutes
afterwards
he
caught
the
fish
and
recovered
his
fly
and
his
tackle
we
constantly
catch
fish
during
the
time
with
broken
tackle
in
their
mouths
who
does
not
recollect
the
rapturous
excitement
caused
by
the
first
fish
caught
in
early
youth
my
first
capture
will
ever
remain
firmly
impressed
on
the
tablet
of
the
brain
for
it
was
a
red
herring
a
common
or
garden
prime
thoroughly
salted
red
herring
it
came
about
in
this
way
at
the
age
of
nine
i
was
taken
by
my
father
on
a
yachting
expedition
round
the
lovely
islands
of
the
west
coast
of
scotland
we
were
at
anchor
the
first
evening
of
the
voyage
in
one
of
the
beautiful
harbours
of
the
hebrides
and
noticing
the
sailors
fishing
over
the
side
of
the
boat
i
begged
to
be
allowed
to
hold
the
line
somehow
or
other
they
managed
to
get
a
red
herring
on
to
the
hook
when
my
attention
was
diverted
so
that
when
i
hauled
up
a
fish
that
in
the
darkness
looked
fairly
silvery
my
excitement
knew
no
bounds
after
the
sailors
had
taken
it
off
the
hook
and
given
it
a
knock
on
the
head
i
rushed
down
with
it
into
the
cabin
where
my
father
and
three
others
were
dining
throwing
my
fish
down
on
to
the
table
i
delightedly
exclaimed
look
what
i
have
caught
father
is
it
a
lovely
fish
i
could
not
understand
the
roars
of
laughter
which
followed
as
one
of
the
party
with
a
horrified
glance
at
my
capture
shouted
take
it
away
take
it
away
redolet
sed
oddly
enough
although
after
this
i
caught
any
amount
of
real
live
fish
i
never
realised
until
months
afterwards
how
miserably
i
had
been
taken
in
by
the
boat
crew
on
that
eventful
night
not
long
afterwards
whilst
fishing
with
a
worm
just
below
the
falls
at
macomber
in
the
highlands
i
made
what
was
for
a
small
boy
a
remarkable
catch
of
sea
trout
i
forget
the
exact
number
but
i
know
i
had
to
take
them
back
in
sacks
they
were
running
at
the
time
and
it
was
very
pretty
to
see
them
continually
jumping
up
the
ladder
out
of
the
spean
into
the
lochy
underneath
this
ladder
where
the
water
boiled
and
seethed
in
a
thousand
eddies
hundreds
of
trout
lay
ready
to
jump
up
the
fall
into
this
foaming
torrent
i
threw
my
heavily
leaded
bait
no
sooner
was
the
worm
in
the
water
than
it
was
seized
by
a
fine
sea
trout
some
of
them
were
nearly
two
pounds
and
although
i
had
a
strong
they
were
often
most
difficult
to
land
for
a
series
of
small
cataracts
dashed
down
amongst
huge
rocks
and
slippery
boulders
until
a
hundred
feet
below
the
calm
deep
macomber
pool
was
reached
as
the
fish
when
hooked
would
often
dash
down
this
foaming
torrent
into
the
pool
below
they
gave
a
tremendous
amount
of
play
before
they
were
landed
there
was
an
element
of
danger
about
it
too
as
a
false
step
might
have
led
to
ugly
complications
amongst
the
rocks
over
which
the
water
came
pouring
down
at
the
rate
of
ten
miles
an
hour
a
boy
of
twelve
years
old
as
i
was
then
would
not
have
stood
a
chance
in
that
roaring
torrent
a
terrible
accident
happened
here
a
few
years
afterwards
a
party
went
from
the
house
where
i
always
stayed
to
fish
at
macomber
falls
there
were
four
ladies
and
two
men
whilst
they
were
sitting
eating
their
luncheon
at
this
romantic
spot
an
argument
arose
as
to
whether
a
man
falling
into
the
seething
pool
below
the
fall
would
be
drowned
or
not
the
water
was
only
about
two
feet
deep
but
the
place
was
a
miniature
whirlpool
and
once
started
down
the
torrent
a
man
would
be
dashed
along
the
rocky
bed
and
carried
far
out
into
the
deep
macomber
pool
beyond
a
gentleman
from
lincolnshire
argued
that
in
would
be
impossible
for
any
one
to
be
drowned
in
such
shallow
water
this
was
at
lunch
little
did
he
imagine
that
within
half
an
hour
his
theory
would
be
put
to
the
test
but
so
it
was
for
whilst
he
was
standing
on
the
rocks
fishing
with
a
large
overcoat
on
he
slipped
and
fell
in
his
became
entangled
round
his
legs
and
he
was
borne
away
at
the
mercy
of
the
current
unfortunately
only
ladies
were
present
his
friend
having
gone
down
stream
twice
he
clutched
hold
of
the
rocky
bank
opposite
them
but
it
was
too
slippery
and
his
hold
gave
way
a
man
jumping
across
the
chasm
might
possibly
have
saved
him
by
risking
his
own
life
for
it
was
only
fourteen
feet
wide
but
it
would
have
been
madness
for
any
of
the
ladies
to
have
attempted
it
so
the
poor
fellow
was
drowned
in
two
feet
of
water
before
their
eyes
and
in
spite
of
their
brave
endeavours
to
save
him
he
must
have
been
stunned
by
repeated
blows
from
the
rocks
or
else
i
think
he
would
have
baffled
successfully
with
the
torrent
the
overcoat
must
have
hampered
him
most
dreadfully
it
was
a
terrible
affair
reminding
one
of
the
death
of
young
romilly
in
the
wharfe
of
which
wordsworth
tells
in
that
beautiful
poem
the
force
of
prayer
bolton
abbey
as
everybody
knows
was
built
hard
by
on
the
river
bank
by
the
sorrowful
mother
in
honour
of
her
boy
that
stately
priory
was
reared
and
wharf
as
he
moved
along
to
matins
join
a
mournful
voice
nor
failed
at
evensong
how
many
a
beautiful
spot
in
the
british
isles
has
been
endowed
with
a
romance
that
will
never
entirely
die
away
owing
to
some
catastrophe
of
this
kind
macomber
falls
are
very
beautiful
indeed
but
one
can
not
pass
the
place
now
without
a
shudder
and
a
sigh
it
has
been
said
that
the
test
of
a
river
is
its
power
to
drown
a
man
there
is
doubtless
a
peculiar
grandeur
about
the
roaring
torrent
but
to
me
there
is
a
still
greater
charm
in
the
gentle
flow
of
a
south
country
trout
stream
such
as
abound
in
hampshire
wiltshire
and
in
the
cotswolds
i
do
not
think
the
coln
is
capable
of
drowning
a
man
though
one
of
the
peregrine
family
told
me
the
other
day
that
the
only
two
men
who
ever
bathed
in
our
stream
died
soon
afterwards
from
the
shock
of
the
intensely
cold
water
but
then
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
old
prejudice
against
cold
water
still
lingers
amongst
the
country
folk
of
gloucestershire
so
that
this
story
must
always
be
taken
grano
there
are
few
trout
streams
to
our
mind
more
delightful
from
the
angler
point
of
view
than
the
gloucestershire
coln
rising
a
few
miles
from
cheltenham
it
runs
into
the
thames
near
lechlade
and
affords
some
fifteen
miles
or
more
of
excellent
fishing
the
scenery
is
of
that
quiet
and
homely
type
that
belongs
so
exclusively
to
the
chalk
and
limestone
streams
of
the
south
of
england
from
its
source
to
the
point
at
which
it
joins
the
isis
the
coln
flows
continuously
through
a
series
of
parks
and
small
demesnes
varied
with
picturesque
cotswold
villages
and
rich
water
meadows
it
swells
out
into
fishable
proportions
just
above
lord
eldon
stowell
property
steals
gently
past
his
beautiful
woods
at
chedworth
and
the
roman
villa
discovered
a
few
years
ago
then
onward
through
the
quaint
villages
of
fossbridge
to
winson
and
though
not
a
hundred
miles
from
london
this
part
of
gloucestershire
is
one
of
the
most
primitive
and
districts
in
england
until
the
new
railway
between
andover
and
cheltenham
was
opened
four
years
ago
with
a
small
station
at
fosscross
there
were
many
inhabitants
of
these
villages
who
had
never
seen
a
train
or
a
railway
only
the
other
day
on
asking
a
good
lady
the
wife
of
a
farmer
whether
she
had
ever
been
in
london
i
received
the
reply
no
but
i
been
to
cheltenham
this
in
a
tone
of
voice
that
meant
me
to
understand
that
going
to
cheltenham
a
distance
of
about
sixteen
miles
was
quite
as
important
an
episode
in
her
life
as
a
visit
to
london
would
have
been
on
leaving
winson
the
coln
widens
out
considerably
and
for
the
next
two
miles
becomes
the
boundary
between
property
of
barnsley
and
the
manor
of
ablington
it
flows
through
the
picturesque
hamlet
of
ablington
within
a
hundred
yards
of
the
old
elizabethan
manor
house
over
an
artificial
fall
in
the
garden
and
passes
onward
on
its
secluded
way
through
lovely
woodland
scenery
until
it
reaches
the
village
of
bibury
here
it
runs
for
nearly
half
a
mile
parallel
with
the
main
street
of
the
village
and
then
enters
the
grounds
of
bibury
court
i
know
no
prettier
village
in
england
than
bibury
and
no
snugger
hostelry
than
the
swan
the
landlady
of
this
inn
has
a
nice
little
stretch
of
water
for
the
use
of
those
who
find
their
way
to
bibury
and
a
pleasanter
place
wherein
to
spend
a
few
quiet
days
could
not
be
found
the
garden
and
old
court
house
of
bibury
are
sweetly
pretty
the
house
like
ablington
being
three
hundred
years
old
the
stream
passes
within
a
few
yards
of
it
over
another
waterfall
of
about
ten
feet
and
soon
reaches
williamstrip
here
again
the
scenery
is
typical
of
rural
england
in
its
most
pleasing
form
and
the
village
of
is
scarcely
less
fascinating
than
bibury
after
leaving
the
stately
pile
of
hatherop
castle
and
williamstrip
park
on
the
left
the
coln
flows
silently
onwards
through
the
delightful
demesne
of
fairford
park
here
the
stream
has
been
broadened
out
into
a
lake
of
some
depth
and
size
and
holds
some
very
large
fish
another
mile
and
fairford
town
is
reached
another
good
specimen
of
the
cotswold
village
for
it
is
a
large
village
rather
than
a
town
with
its
lovely
church
famous
for
its
windows
its
gabled
cottages
and
comfortable
bull
inn
there
are
several
miles
of
fishing
at
the
bull
as
many
an
oxonian
has
discovered
in
times
gone
by
and
we
trust
will
again
from
what
we
have
said
it
will
easily
be
gathered
that
this
stream
is
unsurpassed
for
scenery
of
that
quiet
homely
type
that
kingsley
eulogises
so
enthusiastically
in
his
chalk
stream
studies
and
i
am
inclined
to
agree
with
him
in
his
preference
for
it
over
the
grander
surroundings
of
mountain
streams
let
the
londoner
have
his
six
weeks
every
year
among
crag
and
heather
and
return
with
lungs
expanded
and
muscles
braced
to
his
nine
prison
the
countryman
who
needs
no
such
change
of
air
and
scene
will
prefer
more
homelike
though
more
homely
pleasures
dearer
to
him
than
wild
cataracts
or
alpine
glens
are
the
still
hidden
streams
which
bewick
has
immortalised
in
his
vignettes
and
creswick
in
his
pictures
the
long
grassy
shallow
paved
with
yellow
gravel
where
he
wades
up
between
low
walls
of
rock
beneath
nut
and
oak
and
alder
to
the
low
bar
over
which
the
stream
comes
swirling
and
dimpling
as
the
flits
piping
before
him
and
the
murmur
of
the
ringdove
comes
soft
and
sleepy
through
the
wood
there
as
he
wades
he
sees
a
hundred
sights
and
hears
a
hundred
tones
which
are
hidden
from
the
traveller
on
the
dusty
highway
above
but
à
son
let
us
now
see
what
sort
of
sport
may
be
had
in
the
coln
to
begin
with
it
must
be
described
as
a
stream
this
means
of
course
that
there
is
a
tremendous
rise
of
fly
early
in
june
with
the
inevitable
slack
time
before
and
after
the
time
but
there
is
much
pleasant
angling
to
be
had
at
other
times
the
season
begins
at
the
end
of
march
when
a
few
small
fish
are
rising
and
may
be
caught
with
the
march
brown
or
the
blue
and
olive
duns
few
big
fish
are
in
condition
until
may
but
much
fun
can
be
had
with
the
smaller
ones
all
through
april
the
fight
splendidly
and
give
one
the
idea
on
being
hooked
of
pulling
three
times
their
real
weight
the
april
fishing
at
all
events
after
the
middle
of
the
month
is
very
delightful
in
this
river
one
does
not
actually
kill
many
fish
for
a
large
number
are
caught
and
returned
in
may
when
the
larger
fish
begin
to
take
up
their
places
for
the
summer
one
may
expect
good
sport
this
season
however
has
been
very
disappointing
and
judging
by
the
way
the
fish
were
feeding
on
the
bottom
for
the
first
fortnight
of
the
month
one
is
led
to
expect
an
early
rise
of
the
until
the
fly
is
up
the
april
flies
especially
the
olive
dun
are
all
that
are
necessary
for
a
couple
of
weeks
before
the
carnival
sport
is
always
uncertain
if
the
wind
is
in
a
good
quarter
sport
may
be
had
but
should
it
be
east
the
trout
will
not
leave
the
caddis
with
which
the
bed
of
the
river
is
simply
alive
at
this
time
of
late
years
good
sport
has
been
obtained
at
the
latter
end
of
may
with
small
flies
the
generally
comes
up
on
the
higher
reaches
about
the
last
week
in
may
or
about
june
though
at
fairford
lower
down
it
is
a
week
earlier
a
good
season
means
a
steady
rise
of
fly
lasting
for
nearly
three
weeks
but
with
no
great
amount
of
fly
on
any
one
day
a
bad
season
means
as
a
rule
a
regular
glut
of
fly
for
three
or
four
days
so
that
the
fish
are
stuffed
full
almost
to
bursting
point
and
will
not
look
at
the
natural
fly
afterwards
much
less
at
your
neatly
cocked
artificial
one
large
bags
can
of
course
be
made
on
certain
days
in
the
season
but
i
do
not
know
of
any
better
than
one
hundred
and
six
fish
in
three
days
averaging
one
pound
apiece
sport
however
is
not
estimated
by
the
number
of
fish
taken
and
there
is
no
better
day
fun
for
the
real
fisherman
than
killing
four
or
five
brace
of
good
fish
when
the
trout
are
beginning
to
get
tired
of
the
fly
but
are
still
to
be
caught
by
working
hard
for
them
the
alder
will
often
do
great
execution
at
this
time
and
a
small
blue
dun
is
sometimes
very
killing
in
the
morning
or
evening
after
the
has
lived
his
short
life
and
disappeared
there
is
a
lull
in
the
fishing
and
the
sportsman
may
with
advantage
take
himself
off
to
london
to
see
the
oxford
and
cambridge
cricket
match
all
through
july
and
august
when
the
water
gets
low
and
clear
the
best
and
largest
fish
may
be
taken
from
an
hour
before
sunset
up
to
eleven
at
night
by
the
red
palmer
although
it
savours
somewhat
of
poaching
i
confess
to
a
weakness
for
evening
and
night
fishing
the
cool
water
meadows
the
setting
sun
with
its
golden
glow
on
the
water
add
a
peculiar
charm
to
fishing
at
this
time
of
day
in
the
hot
summer
months
and
then
the
splash
of
your
fish
as
you
hook
him
how
magnified
is
the
sound
in
the
dim
twilight
when
you
can
not
see
but
can
only
hear
and
feel
your
quarry
and
what
satisfaction
to
know
that
that
great
that
was
devouring
goodness
knows
how
many
yearlings
and
fry
daily
is
safe
out
of
the
water
and
in
your
basket
on
rainy
days
in
these
months
good
sport
may
be
had
with
the
wet
fly
and
in
september
a
yellow
dun
or
a
fly
that
imitates
the
wasp
will
kill
if
only
you
can
keep
out
of
sight
and
place
a
fly
right
on
the
fish
nose
the
dry
fly
and
up
stream
is
of
course
the
orthodox
method
of
fishing
in
this
as
in
other
chalk
or
limestone
streams
no
flogging
the
water
indiscriminately
all
the
way
up
but
marking
your
fish
down
and
stalking
him
is
the
real
game
for
those
who
fish
wet
sport
is
not
so
good
as
it
used
to
be
owing
to
the
schoolmaster
being
abroad
amongst
trout
as
well
as
amongst
men
but
on
certain
windy
days
this
method
is
the
only
one
possible
there
is
a
good
deal
of
prejudice
against
the
style
among
the
advocates
of
the
method
of
fishing
that
a
man
who
fishes
with
a
floating
fly
should
be
set
down
as
a
better
sportsman
than
one
who
allows
his
fly
to
sink
is
to
my
thinking
a
argument
and
one
moreover
that
is
not
borne
out
by
facts
true
in
some
clear
chalk
streams
the
fish
can
only
be
killed
with
the
dry
fly
and
in
such
cases
it
is
unsportsmanlike
to
thrash
the
water
in
the
first
place
because
there
is
no
chance
of
catching
fish
and
in
the
second
in
the
interest
of
other
anglers
because
it
is
likely
to
make
the
fish
shy
and
therefore
it
is
a
somewhat
selfish
method
of
fishing
but
let
those
accomplished
exponents
of
the
art
of
fishing
who
are
too
fond
of
applying
the
epithet
poacher
to
all
those
who
do
not
fish
in
their
own
particular
style
remember
that
there
are
but
few
streams
in
england
sluggish
enough
for
fishing
consequently
many
fishermen
have
never
acquired
the
art
the
angler
has
no
more
right
to
consider
himself
superior
as
a
sportsman
to
the
advocate
of
the
method
than
the
county
cricketer
has
to
consider
himself
superior
to
the
village
player
in
both
cases
time
and
practice
have
done
their
work
but
the
best
fishermen
and
the
most
practised
exponents
of
the
game
of
cricket
are
very
often
inferior
to
their
less
distinguished
brethren
as
at
the
same
time
were
i
asked
which
of
all
our
english
sports
requires
the
greatest
amount
of
perseverance
the
supremest
delicacy
of
hand
the
most
assiduous
practice
and
the
most
perfect
control
of
temper
in
order
that
excellence
may
be
attained
i
would
unhesitatingly
answer
fishing
on
a
real
chalk
stream
and
i
would
sooner
have
one
successful
day
under
such
conditions
than
catch
fifty
trout
by
flogging
a
scotch
burn
in
the
coln
the
fish
run
largest
at
fairford
where
the
water
has
been
deepened
and
broadened
and
there
are
not
uncommon
then
at
hatherop
and
williamstrip
there
are
some
big
fish
higher
up
the
trout
run
up
to
two
and
a
half
pounds
and
the
average
size
of
fish
killed
after
may
is
roughly
speaking
one
pound
the
higher
reaches
are
very
much
easier
to
fish
for
the
following
reason
at
bibury
and
at
intervals
of
about
half
a
mile
all
the
way
down
the
river
is
fed
by
copious
springs
of
transparent
water
the
lower
down
you
go
and
the
more
springs
that
fall
into
the
river
the
more
glassy
does
it
become
the
upper
reaches
of
this
river
may
be
described
as
easy
fishing
the
water
when
in
good
trim
is
of
a
whey
colour
though
after
june
it
becomes
low
and
very
clear
the
flies
i
have
mentioned
are
the
only
ones
really
necessary
and
if
the
fish
will
not
take
them
they
will
probably
take
nothing
they
are
to
sum
up
march
brown
olive
dun
blue
dun
alder
palmer
wykeham
fancy
and
the
grey
quill
gnat
are
the
only
other
flies
that
need
be
mentioned
the
former
has
a
great
reputation
on
the
river
but
we
ourselves
have
used
it
but
little
the
food
on
the
coln
is
most
abundant
and
to
this
must
be
attributed
the
extraordinary
size
of
the
fish
as
compared
with
the
depth
and
bulk
of
water
that
one
hundred
and
fifty
brace
of
trout
averaging
a
pound
in
weight
are
taken
with
rod
and
line
each
year
on
a
stretch
of
water
two
miles
in
length
and
varying
in
depth
from
two
to
three
feet
with
a
few
deep
holes
the
width
of
the
water
being
not
more
than
thirty
feet
for
the
most
part
is
sufficient
proof
that
there
is
abundance
of
food
in
the
river
where
the
water
is
shallow
we
have
found
great
advantage
accrue
by
putting
in
large
stones
and
fir
poles
to
form
ripples
and
also
homes
for
the
fish
by
this
means
shallow
reaches
can
be
made
to
hold
good
fish
and
the
eddies
and
ripples
make
them
easy
to
catch
the
stones
add
to
the
picturesqueness
of
the
stream
for
they
soon
become
coated
with
moss
and
give
the
idea
in
some
places
of
a
rocky
scotch
burn
a
pleasant
variety
of
fishing
is
thus
obtained
for
at
one
time
you
are
throwing
a
dry
fly
on
to
the
still
and
unruffled
surface
of
the
broader
reaches
and
a
hundred
yards
lower
down
you
may
have
to
use
a
wet
fly
in
the
narrower
and
quicker
parts
where
the
stones
cause
the
water
to
boil
up
in
all
directions
and
the
eddies
give
a
chance
to
those
who
are
uninitiated
into
the
mysteries
of
angling
the
large
fish
prefer
sluggish
water
but
in
these
artificial
ripples
fish
may
be
caught
on
days
on
which
the
stream
would
be
unfishable
under
ordinary
circumstances
it
would
be
invidious
to
make
comparisons
between
the
coln
and
the
hampshire
rivers
the
itchen
and
the
test
these
are
larger
rivers
with
larger
fish
and
they
require
a
better
fisherman
than
those
stretches
of
the
coin
that
we
are
dealing
with
although
the
lower
reaches
of
the
latter
stream
are
difficult
enough
for
most
people
otters
used
to
be
considered
scarce
on
the
river
coln
but
two
have
lately
been
trapped
in
the
parish
of
bibury
with
pike
and
coarse
fish
we
are
not
troubled
on
the
upper
reaches
though
lower
down
they
exist
in
certain
quantities
of
poachers
i
trust
i
may
say
the
same
rumour
has
sometimes
whispered
of
nets
kept
in
bibury
and
elsewhere
and
of
midnight
raids
on
the
neighbouring
preserves
but
though
i
have
walked
down
the
bank
on
many
a
summer
night
i
have
never
once
come
upon
anything
suspicious
not
even
a
the
gloucestershire
native
is
an
honest
man
he
may
think
perhaps
that
he
has
nothing
to
learn
and
can
not
go
wrong
but
burglaries
are
practically
unknown
and
poaching
is
not
commonly
practised
to
sum
up
the
river
coln
affords
excellent
sport
amid
surroundings
seldom
to
be
found
in
these
days
the
whole
country
reminds
one
of
the
days
of
merrie
england
so
quaint
and
rural
are
the
scenes
the
houses
and
cottages
are
all
built
of
the
native
stone
which
can
be
obtained
for
the
trouble
of
digging
so
there
is
no
danger
of
modern
villas
or
the
inroads
of
civilisation
spoiling
the
face
of
the
country
and
moreover
these
country
people
being
simple
in
their
tastes
have
never
endeavoured
to
improve
on
the
old
style
of
building
the
newer
cottages
with
their
pointed
gables
closely
resemble
the
old
elizabethan
houses
the
new
stone
soon
tones
down
and
every
house
has
a
pretty
garden
attached
to
it
i
have
just
returned
from
a
stroll
by
the
river
with
my
rod
in
hand
on
the
for
a
rise
not
a
fish
was
stirring
it
is
the
middle
of
may
and
this
glorious
valley
is
growing
more
and
more
glorious
every
day
an
evening
walk
by
the
stream
is
delightful
now
even
though
you
may
begin
to
wonder
if
all
the
fish
have
disappeared
the
air
is
full
of
joyful
sounds
the
cuckoo
the
corncrake
and
the
cock
pheasant
seem
to
be
vieing
with
each
other
but
alas
nightingales
there
are
none
as
i
come
round
a
bend
up
get
a
mallard
and
a
duck
and
beautiful
they
look
as
they
swing
round
me
in
the
dazzling
sunlight
a
little
further
on
i
come
upon
a
whole
brood
of
nineteen
little
wild
ducks
the
old
mothers
are
a
good
deal
tamer
now
than
they
were
in
the
shooting
season
many
a
time
have
they
got
up
just
out
of
shot
when
i
was
trying
to
wile
away
the
time
during
the
great
frost
with
a
little
stalking
a
kingfisher
shoots
past
but
i
have
given
up
trying
to
find
her
nest
there
is
a
brood
of
dabchicks
and
a
little
further
on
another
family
of
wild
duck
the
spring
flowers
are
just
now
in
their
flush
of
pride
and
glory
clothing
the
banks
and
reflected
everywhere
in
the
blue
waters
of
the
stream
are
great
clusters
of
marsh
marigolds
painting
the
meadows
with
their
flaming
gold
out
of
the
decayed
stoles
of
trees
that
fell
by
the
water
edge
years
and
years
ago
springs
the
glowing
violet
here
and
there
as
one
throws
a
fly
towards
the
opposite
bank
a
purple
glow
on
the
surface
of
the
stream
draws
the
attention
to
a
glorious
mass
of
violets
on
the
mossy
bank
above
myriads
of
dainty
cuckoo
flowers
with
cowslips
wan
that
hang
the
pensive
head
and
every
flower
that
sad
embroidery
wears
are
likewise
to
be
seen
farther
away
from
the
stream
bank
on
the
upland
lawn
and
along
the
hedge
towards
the
downs
the
deep
purple
of
the
hyacinth
and
orchis
and
the
perfect
blue
of
the
little
eyebright
or
germander
speedwell
are
visible
even
at
a
distance
in
a
week
the
lilac
and
sweet
honeysuckle
will
fill
the
air
with
grateful
redolence
ah
a
but
i
know
this
is
only
a
false
alarm
there
are
always
a
few
stray
ones
about
at
this
time
the
fly
will
not
be
up
for
ten
days
at
least
when
it
does
come
the
stream
so
smooth
and
glassy
now
will
be
like
a
pot
as
the
villagers
say
you
would
not
think
it
possible
that
a
small
brook
could
contain
so
many
big
fish
as
will
show
themselves
when
the
fly
is
up
in
conclusion
we
will
quote
once
more
from
dear
old
charles
kingsley
for
what
was
true
fifty
years
ago
is
true
now
at
all
events
in
this
part
of
gloucestershire
and
may
it
ever
remain
so
come
then
you
who
want
pleasant
fishing
days
without
the
waste
of
time
and
trouble
and
expense
involved
in
two
hundred
miles
of
railway
journey
and
perhaps
fifty
more
of
highland
road
come
to
pleasant
country
inns
where
you
can
always
get
a
good
dinner
or
better
still
to
pleasant
country
houses
where
you
can
always
get
good
society
to
rivers
which
always
fish
brimful
instead
of
being
as
these
mountain
ones
are
very
like
a
turnpike
road
for
three
weeks
and
then
like
bottled
porter
for
three
days
to
streams
on
which
you
have
strong
breezes
for
a
week
together
on
a
clear
fishing
water
instead
of
having
as
on
these
mountain
ones
foul
rain
spate
as
long
as
the
wind
is
and
clearing
water
when
the
wind
chops
up
to
the
north
streams
in
a
word
where
you
may
kill
fish
four
days
out
of
five
from
april
to
october
instead
of
having
as
you
will
most
probably
in
the
mountain
just
one
day

the
whole
of
your

that
we

love
so
well
in
the
quiet

where
the
trout
streams
wend
their
silent
ways
it
comes
of
a
sunday
answers
the
keeper
who
would
fain
see
the
prejudice
against
fishing
on
the
sabbath
scattered
to
the
four
winds
of
heaven
he
thinks
it
very
contrary
of
the
fly
that
it
should
invariably
come
up
strong
on
the
one
day
in
the
week
on
which
the
trout
are
usually
allowed
a
rest
is
a
most
comical
job
but
it
always
comes
up
thickest
of
a
sunday
he
frequently
exclaims
then
if
you
press
him
for
further
particulars
he
grows
eloquent
on
the
subject
and
tells
you
as
follows
we
always
reckons
to
kill
the
most
fish
on
day
is
a
most
singular
thing
but
the
day
is
always
the
best
now
considering
that
derby
day
is
a
movable
feast
saving
that
it
always
comes
on
a
wednesday
there
would
appear
to
be
no
more
logic
in
this
statement
than
there
is
in
the
one
about
the
fly
coming
up
strong
on
a
sunday
however
so
deep
rooted
is
the
theory
that
the
derby
and
the
cream
of
the
fishing
are
inseparably
associated
that
we
have
come
to
talk
of
the
biggest
rise
of
the
season
as
the
derby
day
whatever
day
of
the
week
it
may
happen
to
be
thus
tom
peregrine
the
keeper
when
he
sees
the
fly
gradually
coming
up
will
say
i
can
see
how
it
will
be
next
friday
will
be
durby
day
you
must
the
fly
that
day
sure
and
give
it
the
meeting
sir
we
shall
want
six
rods
on
the
water
on
friday
he
is
so
desperately
keen
to
kill
fish
that
he
would
sooner
have
six
rods
and
moderate
sport
for
each
fisherman
than
three
rods
and
good
sport
all
round
wonderfully
sanguine
is
this
fellow
temperament
a
man
he
seems
of
cheerful
yesterdays
and
confident
it
is
always
just
about
a
good
day
for
fishing
before
you
start
and
if
you
have
a
bad
day
he
consoles
you
with
an
account
of
an
extraordinary
day
last
week
or
one
you
are
to
have
next
week
sometimes
it
was
last
season
that
was
so
good
or
it
will
be
a
splendid
season
next
year
for
some
reason
or
other
only
known
to
himself
three
good
anglers
are
quite
sufficient
for
two
miles
of
fishing
on
the
best
of
days
experience
has
taught
us
that
too
many
cooks
spoil
the
broth
even
in
the
season
i
shall
never
forget
a
most
lamentable
though
somewhat
laughable
occurrence
which
took
place
five
years
ago
foolishly
responding
to
the
entreaties
of
our
enthusiastic
friend
the
keeper
we
actually
did
ask
five
people
to
fish
one
durby
day
as
luck
would
have
it
they
all
came
but
unfortunately
a
neighbouring
squire
who
owns
part
of
the
water
but
who
seldom
turns
up
to
fish
also
chose
that
day
and
with
him
came
his
son
seven
was
bad
enough
in
all
conscience
but
imagine
my
feelings
when
a
waggonette
drove
up
full
of
from
my
brother
who
was
one
of
the
undergraduates
had
brought
them
down
on
the
chance
and
without
any
warning
of
course
they
all
wanted
to
fish
though
for
the
most
part
they
were
quite
innocent
of
the
art
of
throwing
a
fly
result
ten
or
a
dozen
fisherman
all
in
each
way
every
rising
fish
in
the
brook
frightened
out
of
its
wits
and
very
little
sport
the
total
catch
for
the
day
was
only
thirty
trout
or
exactly
what
three
rods
ought
to
have
caught
these
were
the
sort
of
remarks
one
had
to
put
up
with
i
say
old
chap
there
a
d
d
fellow
in
a
mackintosh
suit
up
stream
bagged
my
water
or
who
is
that
idiot
who
has
been
flogging
away
all
the
afternoon
in
one
place
does
he
think
he
beating
carpets
or
is
he
an
escaped
lunatic
from
hanwell
the
whole
thing
was
too
absurd
it
was
like
a
fishing
competition
on
the
thames
at
twickenham
since
this
day
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
to
have
too
few
anglers
is
better
than
too
many
also
alas
that
it
is
quite
useless
to
ask
your
friends
to
come
unless
they
are
accomplished
fishermen
it
takes
years
of
practice
to
learn
the
art
of
catching
trout
in
these
days
when
every
fish
knows
as
well
as
we
do
the
difference
between
the
real
fly
and
the
artificial
one
might
as
well
ask
a
lot
of
schoolboys
to
a
big
shoot
as
issue
indiscriminate
invitations
to
fish
it
is
a
prochronism
to
talk
of
the
for
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
first
ten
days
of
usually
constitute
the
season
of
late
years
the
rise
has
been
earlier
and
more
scanty
than
of
yore
there
are
always
several
days
however
during
the
rise
when
all
the
biggest
fish
in
the
brook
come
out
from
their
homes
beneath
the
willows
take
up
a
favourable
place
in
mid
stream
and
quietly
suck
down
fly
after
fly
until
they
are
absolutely
stuffed
to
have
fished
on
one
of
these
days
in
any
brook
is
something
to
look
back
upon
for
many
a
long
day
in
a
reach
of
water
not
exceeding
one
hundred
yards
in
length
there
will
be
fish
enough
to
occupy
you
throughout
the
day
you
may
catch
seven
or
eight
brace
of
trout
none
of
which
are
under
a
pound
in
weight
where
you
did
not
believe
any
large
ones
existed
the
fact
is
the
larger
fish
of
a
trout
stream
are
more
like
rats
in
their
habits
than
anything
else
they
stow
themselves
away
in
holes
in
the
bank
and
all
sorts
of
inconceivable
places
and
are
as
invisible
by
day
as
the
otter
itself
that
man
derives
the
greatest
enjoyment
from
this
annual
carnival
among
the
trout
who
has
been
tied
to
london
all
through
may
sweltering
in
a
stuffy
office
and
longing
for
the
country
though
his
sympathies
are
bound
up
heart
and
soul
in
country
pursuits
he
has
elected
to
live
laborious
days
in
the
busy
haunts
of
men
he
does
it
though
he
hates
it
for
he
has
sufficient
insight
to
know
that
in
some
form
or
other
is
the
inevitable
destiny
of
mortal
man
sooner
or
later
it
has
to
be
undergone
by
all
whether
we
like
it
or
not
quanto
quisque
sibi
plura
negaverit
ab
dis
plura
feret
horace
never
wrote
anything
truer
than
that
though
we
are
not
to
suppose
that
the
second
line
will
necessarily
come
true
in
this
life
we
will
imagine
that
our
friend
is
a
briefless
barrister
but
a
fine
sportsman
a
crack
batsman
perhaps
at
eton
and
oxford
or
one
of
whom
it
might
be
said
give
me
the
man
to
whom
nought
comes
amiss
one
horse
or
another
that
country
or
this
who
through
falls
and
bad
starts
undauntedly
still
rides
up
to
the
motto
with
them
i
will
there
may
be
good
sportsmen
enough
enjoying
life
throughout
the
country
villages
of
merrie
england
but
in
my
humble
opinion
the
sportsmen
must
be
sought
in
stifling
offices
in
london
or
serving
their
country
and
their
queen
under
the
burning
sun
of
a
far
country
or
maybe
in
the
reeking
atmosphere
of
the
east
end
or
as
missionaries
in
that
howling
wilderness
the
inhospitable
land
of
the
heathen
chinee
sitting
in
his
dusty
chambers
poring
over
grimy
books
and
legal
manuscripts
our
briefless
friend
receives
a
telegram
which
he
has
been
expecting
rather
anxiously
the
last
few
days
as
brief
as
he
is
briefless
it
brings
a
flush
to
his
cheek
which
has
not
been
seen
there
since
that
great
run
with
the
hounds
last
christmas
holidays
the
fly
is
up
come
at
once
these
are
the
magic
words
and
no
time
is
lost
in
responding
to
the
invitation
for
as
prearranged
he
is
to
start
for
gloucestershire
directly
the
wire
arrives
there
is
no
need
to
rush
off
to
farlow
and
buy
up
his
stock
of
for
though
he
does
not
tie
his
own
flies
our
angling
friend
has
a
goodly
stock
of
them
neatly
arranged
in
rows
of
cork
inside
a
black
tin
box
and
depend
upon
it
they
are
the
ones
many
a
fisherman
goes
through
a
lifetime
without
getting
the
right
flies
for
the
water
on
which
he
angles
it
is
ten
to
one
that
those
in
the
shops
are
too
light
both
in
the
body
and
the
wing
the
usually
sold
are
likewise
much
too
big
about
half
is
quite
big
enough
for
the
artificial
fly
and
as
a
general
rule
they
can
not
be
too
some
years
ago
we
caught
a
live
fly
and
took
it
up
to
london
for
the
shopman
to
copy
at
last
we
said
to
ourselves
we
have
got
the
right
thing
but
not
a
bit
of
it
the
first
cast
on
to
the
water
showed
us
that
the
fly
was
utterly
wrong
it
was
far
too
light
the
fact
is
the
insect
itself
appears
very
much
darker
on
the
water
than
it
does
in
the
air
but
the
artificial
fly
shows
ten
times
lighter
as
it
floats
on
the
stream
than
it
does
in
the
shop
window
dark
mottled
grey
for
your
wings
and
a
brown
hackle
with
a
dark
rather
than
a
body
is
the
kind
of
fly
we
find
most
killing
on
the
upper
coln
of
course
it
may
be
different
on
other
streams
but
i
suspect
there
is
a
tendency
to
use
too
light
a
fly
everywhere
save
among
those
who
have
learnt
by
experience
how
to
catch
trout
as
sir
herbert
maxwell
has
proved
by
experiment
trout
have
no
perception
of
colour
except
so
far
as
the
fly
is
light
or
dark
he
found
dark
blue
and
red
flies
just
as
killing
as
the
ordinary
for
the
fisherman
equipment
is
half
the
battle
show
me
the
man
who
catches
fish
ten
to
one
his
rod
is
well
balanced
and
strong
his
line
heavy
though
tapered
and
his
gut
well
selected
and
stained
the
stamps
the
fisherman
even
more
truly
than
the
topboot
stamps
the
nor
does
the
accomplished
expert
with
the
dry
fly
disdain
with
fat
of
deer
to
grease
his
line
nor
with
paraffin
to
dress
his
fly
and
make
it
float
but
he
keeps
the
paraffin
in
a
leather
case
by
itself
so
that
his
coat
may
not
remain
redolent
for
months
from
top
to
toe
he
is
a
fisherman
his
boots
are
thick
even
though
he
does
not
require
waders
on
his
knees
are
leather
pads
to
ward
off
rheumatism
whilst
on
his
head
is
a
cap
not
a
white
straw
hat
flashing
in
the
sunlight
and
scaring
the
timid
trout
to
death
thus
appears
our
sportsman
of
the
inner
temple
not
twelve
hours
after
we
saw
him
stewing
in
his
london
chambers
what
a
metamorphosis
is
this
just
as
the
after
two
years
of
confinement
as
a
wretched
grub
in
the
muddy
bed
of
the
stream
throws
off
its
shackles
gives
its
wings
a
shake
and
soars
into
the
glorious
june
atmosphere
happy
to
be
free
so
does
the
poor
caged
bird
rejoice
after
grubbing
for
an
indefinite
period
in
a
cramped
cell
to
leave
darkness
and
dirt
and
gloom
though
not
like
the
for
ever
and
flee
away
on
wings
the
mighty
steam
provides
until
he
finds
himself
once
again
in
the
fresh
green
fields
he
loves
so
well
and
truly
he
gets
his
reward
he
has
come
into
a
new
world
rather
i
should
say
a
paradise
for
he
comes
when
meadows
are
green
and
trees
are
at
their
prime
though
the
glory
of
the
lilac
has
passed
away
the
buttercup
still
gilds
the
landscape
barley
fields
are
bright
with
yellow
charlock
and
the
soft
subdued
glow
of
sainfoin
gives
colour
to
the
breezy
uplands
as
of
acres
of
pink
carnations
on
one
side
a
vast
sheet
of
saffron
on
the
other
a
lake
of
rubies
ripples
in
the
passing
breeze
or
breaks
into
rolling
waves
of
light
and
shade
as
the
fleecy
clouds
sweep
across
azure
skies
he
comes
when
roses
pink
and
white
and
red
are
just
beginning
to
hang
their
dainty
heads
in
modest
beauty
on
every
cottage
wall
or
cluster
round
the
ancient
porch
when
from
every
lattice
window
in
the
hamlet
i
wish
i
could
say
every
window
rows
of
red
geraniums
peep
from
their
brown
pots
of
brightening
the
street
without
and
filling
the
cosy
rooms
with
grateful
unaccustomed
fragrance
when
the
scent
of
the
sweet
honeysuckle
pervades
the
atmosphere
and
the
faces
of
the
handsome
peasants
are
bronzed
as
those
of
dusky
dwellers
under
italian
skies
no
daintie
flowre
or
herbe
that
grows
on
ground
no
arborett
with
painted
blossoms
drest
and
smelling
sweete
but
there
it
might
be
found
to
bud
out
faire
and
throwe
her
sweete
smels
al
around
spenser
what
a
pleasant
country
is
this
in
which
to
spend
a
holiday
how
white
are
the
limestone
roads
how
fresh
and
invigorating
is
the
upland
air
the
old
manor
house
is
deserted
its
occupants
having
gone
to
london
but
a
couple
of
bachelors
can
be
happy
in
an
empty
house
without
servants
and
modern
luxuries
as
long
as
the
lasts
it
is
pleasant
to
feel
that
you
can
dine
at
any
hour
you
please
and
wear
what
you
please
the
good
lady
who
cooks
for
you
is
merely
the
wife
of
one
of
the
shepherds
but
her
cooking
is
fit
for
a
king
what
dinner
could
be
better
than
a
trout
fresh
from
the
brook
a
leg
of
lamb
from
the
farm
and
a
gooseberry
tart
from
the
kitchen
garden
for
vegetables
you
may
have
asparagus
of
such
excellence
that
you
scarcely
know
which
end
to
begin
eating
and
new
potatoes
for
my
part
i
would
sooner
a
thousand
times
live
on
homely
fare
in
the
country
than
be
condemned
to
wade
through
long
courses
at
london
dinner
parties
or
worse
still
pay
fabulous
prices
at
willis
rooms
the
berkeley
or
at
white
club
what
a
comfort
too
to
be
without
housemaids
to
tidy
up
your
papers
in
the
and
shut
your
windows
in
the
evening
how
healthful
to
sleep
in
a
room
in
which
the
windows
have
been
wide
open
night
and
day
for
months
past
sport
is
usually
to
be
depended
upon
in
the
time
as
long
as
you
are
not
late
for
the
rise
of
late
years
the
fly
has
come
up
so
early
and
in
such
limited
quantities
that
but
few
fishermen
were
on
the
water
in
time
we
are
apt
to
grumble
declaring
that
the
whole
river
has
gone
to
the
bad
that
the
fish
are
smaller
and
fewer
in
numbers
than
of
yore
but
is
this
borne
out
by
facts
the
year
was
no
doubt
rather
a
failure
as
regards
the
but
as
i
glance
over
the
pages
of
the
in
which
i
record
as
far
as
possible
every
fish
that
is
killed
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
sport
has
been
very
wonderful
take
it
all
round
during
six
out
of
seven
seasons
it
is
a
lovely
day
during
the
last
week
in
may
there
has
been
no
rain
for
more
than
a
fortnight
the
wind
is
and
the
sun
shines
brightly
yet
we
walk
down
to
the
river
coln
anticinating
a
good
sport
among
the
trout
for
during
the
season
no
matter
how
unpropitious
the
weather
may
appear
sport
is
more
of
a
certainty
on
this
stream
than
at
any
other
time
of
year
early
in
the
season
drought
does
not
appear
to
have
any
effect
on
the
springs
we
might
get
no
rain
from
the
middle
of
april
until
through
june
and
yet
the
water
will
keep
up
and
remain
a
good
colour
all
the
time
but
after
june
is
out
down
goes
the
water
lower
and
lower
every
week
no
amount
of
rain
will
then
make
any
perceptible
increase
to
the
volume
of
the
stream
and
not
until
the
nights
begin
to
lengthen
out
and
the
autumnal
gales
have
done
their
work
will
the
water
rise
again
to
its
normal
height
if
you
ask
tom
peregrine
why
these
things
are
so
he
will
only
tell
you
that
after
a
few
gales
the
springs
be
the
word
frum
the
derivation
of
which
is
fram
or
from
strong
flourishing
is
the
local
expression
for
the
bursting
of
the
springs
our
friend
tom
peregrine
is
full
of
these
quaint
expressions
when
he
sees
a
covey
of
partridges
dusting
themselves
in
the
roads
he
will
tell
you
they
are
bathering
a
dog
hunting
through
a
wood
is
always
said
to
be
breveting
i
do
like
that
dog
of
he
do
so
is
a
favourite
saying
the
ground
on
a
frosty
morning
scrumps
or
feels
scrumpety
as
you
walk
across
the
fields
and
the
partridges
when
wild
are
teert
all
these
phrases
are
very
happy
the
sound
of
the
words
illustrating
exactly
the
idea
they
are
intended
to
convey
besides
ordinary
gloucestershire
expressions
the
keeper
has
a
large
variety
that
he
has
invented
for
himself
when
the
river
comes
down
clear
it
is
invariably
described
as
like
looking
into
a
gin
bottle
or
as
clear
as
gin
a
trout
rising
boldly
at
a
fly
is
said
to
up
or
boil
up
or
even
come
at
it
like
a
dog
the
word
mess
is
used
to
imply
disgust
of
any
sort
i
see
one
boil
up
just
above
that
mess
of
weed
or
if
you
get
a
bit
of
weed
on
the
hook
he
will
exclaim
bother
that
mess
of
weed
has
put
him
down
sometimes
he
remarks
tis
these
dreadful
frostis
that
spiles
everything
is
enough
to
sterve
anybody
when
he
sees
a
bad
fisherman
at
work
he
nods
his
head
woefully
and
exclaims
he
might
as
well
throw
his
in
then
again
if
he
is
anxious
that
you
should
catch
a
particular
trout
which
can
not
be
persuaded
to
rise
he
always
says
terrify
him
sir
keep
on
terrifying
of
him
this
does
not
mean
that
you
are
to
frighten
the
fish
on
the
contrary
he
is
urging
you
to
stick
to
him
till
he
gets
tired
of
being
harassed
and
succumbs
to
temptation
all
these
quaint
expressions
make
this
sort
of
folk
very
amusing
companions
for
a
day
fishing
it
is
eleven
let
us
walk
down
stream
until
we
come
to
a
bend
in
the
river
where
the
wind
is
less
unfavourable
than
it
is
in
most
parts
there
is
a
short
stretch
of
two
hundred
yards
where
as
we
fish
up
stream
the
breeze
will
be
almost
at
our
backs
and
there
are
fish
enough
to
occupy
us
for
an
hour
or
so
afterwards
we
shall
have
to
cut
the
wind
as
best
we
can
as
we
pass
down
stream
the
pale
olive
duns
are
hatching
out
in
fair
numbers
and
a
few
fish
are
already
on
the
move
what
lovely
delicate
things
are
these
duns
and
how
beautifully
and
wonderfully
are
they
made
if
you
catch
one
you
will
see
that
it
is
as
delicate
and
transparent
as
it
can
possibly
be
not
even
the
can
compare
with
the
dun
and
what
rare
food
for
trout
they
supply
for
more
than
six
weeks
from
april
they
hatch
out
by
thousands
every
sunny
day
the
may
be
a
total
failure
but
week
after
week
in
the
early
spring
you
may
go
down
to
the
riverside
with
but
one
sort
of
fly
and
if
there
are
fish
to
be
caught
at
all
the
olive
dun
will
catch
them
and
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
there
are
a
few
on
the
water
it
is
with
the
little
duns
that
we
intend
to
start
our
fishing
the
trout
have
not
yet
got
thoroughly
accustomed
to
the
and
the
durby
day
will
not
be
here
for
a
week
it
is
far
better
to
leave
them
to
get
reconciled
to
the
new
fly
as
the
keeper
would
put
it
they
will
quap
up
all
the
better
in
a
few
days
if
allowed
in
angling
phraseology
to
get
well
on
to
the
fly
on
arriving
at
the
spot
at
which
we
intend
commencing
operations
it
is
evident
that
the
rise
has
begun
happily
everything
was
in
readiness
our
tapered
gut
cast
has
been
wetted
and
a
fly
is
at
the
end
the
gut
nearest
the
hook
is
as
fine
as
gut
can
possibly
be
anything
thicker
would
be
detected
for
a
spring
joins
the
river
at
this
point
and
makes
the
water
rather
clear
higher
up
we
need
not
be
so
particular
there
is
a
fish
rising
fifteen
yards
above
us
so
crouching
low
and
keeping
back
from
the
bank
we
begin
casting
a
leather
kneecap
borrowed
from
the
is
strapped
on
to
the
knee
and
is
a
good
precaution
against
rheumatism
the
first
cast
is
two
feet
short
of
the
rise
but
with
the
next
we
hook
a
trout
he
makes
a
tremendous
rush
and
runs
the
reel
merrily
we
manage
to
keep
him
out
of
the
weeds
and
land
him
a
silvery
loch
leven
about
of
a
pound
and
in
excellent
condition
only
two
years
ago
he
was
put
into
the
stream
with
five
hundred
others
as
a
yearling
the
next
two
rising
fish
are
too
much
for
us
and
we
bungle
them
one
sees
the
line
owing
to
our
throwing
too
far
above
him
and
the
other
is
frightened
out
of
his
life
by
a
bit
of
weed
or
grass
which
gets
hitched
on
to
the
barb
of
the
hook
and
lands
bang
on
to
his
nose
these
accidents
will
happen
so
we
do
not
swear
but
pass
on
up
stream
and
soon
a
great
brown
tail
appears
for
a
second
just
above
some
rushes
on
the
other
side
kneeling
down
again
we
manage
after
a
few
casts
luckily
short
of
our
fish
to
drop
the
fly
a
foot
above
him
down
it
sails
not
cocking
as
nicely
as
could
be
wished
but
in
an
exact
line
for
his
nose
there
is
a
slight
dimple
and
we
have
got
him
for
two
or
three
minutes
we
are
at
the
mercy
of
our
fish
for
we
dare
not
check
him
the
gut
is
too
fine
but
lacking
condition
he
soon
tires
and
is
landed
he
is
over
a
pound
and
a
half
and
rather
lanky
but
kill
him
we
must
for
by
the
size
of
his
head
we
can
see
that
he
is
an
old
fish
and
as
bad
as
a
pike
for
eating
fry
two
are
now
landed
in
rapid
succession
and
returned
to
the
water
then
we
hook
a
veritable
monster
but
alas
he
makes
a
terrific
rush
down
stream
and
the
gut
breaks
in
the
weeds
of
course
he
is
put
down
as
the
biggest
fish
ever
hooked
in
the
water
as
a
matter
of
fact
two
pounds
would
probably
see
him
putting
on
another
olive
dun
we
are
soon
playing
a
handsome
bright
fish
of
a
pound
with
thick
shoulders
and
a
small
head
and
a
lovely
sight
he
is
when
we
get
him
out
of
the
water
and
knock
him
on
the
head
we
now
come
to
a
place
where
some
big
stones
have
been
placed
to
make
ripples
and
eddies
and
the
stream
is
more
rapid
glad
of
the
chance
of
a
rest
from
the
effort
of
fishing
dry
which
is
tiring
to
the
wrist
and
back
we
get
closer
to
the
bank
and
flog
away
for
five
minutes
without
success
suddenly
we
hear
a
voice
behind
and
looking
round
see
our
mysterious
keeper
who
is
always
turning
up
unexpectedly
without
one
being
able
to
tell
where
he
has
sprung
from
the
fish
be
all
alive
above
the
washpool
i
never
see
such
a
sight
in
all
my
life
he
breathlessly
exclaims
all
right
we
reply
we
be
up
there
directly
but
let
first
of
all
try
for
the
big
one
that
lies
just
above
that
stone
there
one
up
there
another
up
the
river
boiling
says
our
loquacious
companion
that
the
big
fish
we
reply
vigorously
flogging
the
air
to
dry
the
fly
for
when
there
is
a
big
fish
about
one
always
gives
him
as
neatly
a
cocked
fly
as
is
possible
have
him
bang
over
him
exclaims
tom
peregrine
excitedly
but
there
is
no
response
from
the
fish
keep
of
him
keep
of
him
whispers
tom
he
bound
to
make
a
mistake
sooner
or
later
so
we
try
again
and
at
the
same
moment
that
the
fly
floats
down
over
the
monster
nose
he
moves
a
foot
to
the
right
and
takes
a
live
with
a
big
roll
and
a
flop
well
i
never
try
him
with
a
sir
says
peregrine
thinking
this
advice
sound
we
hastily
put
on
the
first
of
the
season
and
no
sooner
have
we
made
our
cast
than
as
rudyard
kipling
once
said
to
the
writer
there
is
a
boil
in
the
water
like
the
launch
of
a
young
yacht
a
tremendous
swirl
and
we
are
fast
into
a
famous
trout
directly
he
feels
the
insulting
sting
of
the
hook
he
rushes
down
stream
at
a
terrific
rate
so
that
the
line
instead
of
being
taut
dangles
loosely
on
the
water
we
gather
the
line
through
the
rings
in
breathless
haste
there
is
no
time
to
reel
up
and
once
more
get
a
tight
strain
on
him
fortunately
there
are
no
weeds
here
the
current
is
too
rapid
for
them
twice
he
jumps
clean
out
of
the
water
his
broad
silvery
sides
flashing
in
the
sunlight
at
length
after
a
five
fight
during
which
our
companion
never
stops
talking
we
land
the
best
fish
we
have
caught
for
four
years
nearly
three
pounds
he
is
as
fat
as
butter
as
bright
as
a
new
shilling
with
the
pinkest
of
pink
spots
along
his
sides
and
his
broad
back
is
mottled
green
the
head
is
small
indicating
that
he
is
not
a
cannibal
but
a
real
trout
and
it
is
rare
in
may
to
catch
a
big
fish
that
has
grown
into
condition
we
have
now
four
trout
in
the
basket
a
pretty
dish
of
fish
as
peregrine
ejaculates
several
times
as
we
walk
up
stream
towards
the
washpool
for
thirty
years
he
has
been
about
this
water
and
has
seen
thousands
of
fish
caught
yet
he
is
as
keen
as
a
boy
with
his
first
trout
as
we
pass
through
a
wood
we
question
him
as
to
a
small
stone
hut
which
appeared
to
have
fallen
out
of
repair
oh
he
replied
that
was
built
in
the
time
of
the
romans
and
then
he
went
on
to
tell
us
how
a
battle
was
fought
in
the
wood
and
how
about
twenty
years
ago
they
had
found
a
skeleton
of
a
man
nearly
seven
feet
long
a
sure
proof
he
added
that
the
romans
had
fought
here
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
are
several
roman
villas
in
the
neighbourhood
and
there
was
also
fighting
hereabouts
in
the
civil
wars
but
half
the
country
folk
look
upon
everything
that
happened
more
than
a
hundred
years
ago
as
having
taken
place
in
the
time
of
the
romans
and
oliver
cromwell
is
to
them
as
mythical
a
personage
and
belonging
to
an
equally
remote
antiquity
as
julius
caesar
the
welsh
people
are
just
the
same
the
other
day
we
were
shown
a
huge
pair
of
rusty
scissors
whilst
staying
in
breconshire
the
man
who
found
them
took
them
to
the
big
house
for
the
squire
to
keep
as
a
curiosity
for
no
doubt
he
said
they
once
belonged
to
great
to
our
disgust
on
reaching
the
upper
water
we
found
it
as
thick
as
had
been
going
on
a
mile
or
so
above
us
never
having
had
any
sport
under
these
conditions
in
past
times
we
had
quite
decided
to
give
up
fishing
for
the
day
but
tom
peregrine
who
is
ever
sanguine
swore
he
saw
a
fish
rise
to
our
astonishment
on
putting
the
fly
over
the
spot
we
hooked
and
landed
a
large
trout
proceeding
up
stream
two
more
were
quickly
basketed
when
the
water
comes
down
as
thick
as
the
thames
at
london
bridge
after
sheep
washing
the
big
trout
are
often
attracted
out
of
their
holes
by
the
insects
washed
out
of
the
wool
but
they
will
seldom
rise
freely
to
the
artificial
fly
on
such
occasions
oddly
enough
they
take
any
fly
they
can
see
in
the
thick
water
and
with
a
substituted
for
the
as
being
more
easily
seen
in
the
discoloured
water
any
number
of
fish
were
to
be
caught
but
there
is
little
merit
and
consequently
little
satisfaction
in
pulling
out
big
trout
under
these
conditions
so
that
having
got
seven
fish
weighing
nine
pounds
in
the
basket
we
are
satisfied
as
a
rule
it
is
only
in
the
season
that
the
biggest
fish
rise
freely
an
average
weight
of
one
pound
per
fish
is
usually
considered
in
the
coln
on
this
day
however
although
the
was
not
yet
properly
up
the
big
fish
which
generally
feed
at
night
had
been
brought
on
the
rise
by
the
all
the
way
home
we
are
regaled
with
impossible
stories
of
big
fish
taken
in
these
waters
one
of
which
the
keeper
says
weighed
five
pounds
all
but
a
penny
piece
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
fish
was
taken
out
of
a
large
spring
close
to
the
river
and
it
is
very
rarely
that
a
is
caught
in
the
coln
above
bibury
whilst
anything
over
that
weight
is
not
caught
once
in
a
month
of
sundays
last
january
however
a
dead
trout
weighing
three
pounds
eight
ounces
was
found
at
bibury
mill
and
a
few
others
about
the
same
size
have
been
taken
during
recent
years
at
fairford
where
the
stream
is
bigger
a
was
taken
during
the
last
we
are
pleased
to
find
that
our
friend
from
london
who
has
been
fishing
the
same
water
has
done
splendidly
he
has
killed
six
brace
of
good
trout
besides
returning
a
large
number
to
the
water
with
a
glow
of
satisfaction
he
tells
from
what
pool
the
noblest
had
been
dragg
and
where
the
very
monarch
of
the
brook
after
long
struggle
had
escaped
at
last
wordsworth
we
laid
our
combined
bag
on
the
cool
stone
floor
in
the
game
larder
and
verily
the
silent
creatures
made
a
splendid
sight
together
thus
exposed
dead
but
not
sullied
or
deformed
by
death
that
seem
to
pity
what
he
could
not
spare
wordsworth
but
the
killing
of
trout
is
only
a
small
part
of
the
pleasure
of
being
here
when
the
is
up
how
pleasant
to
live
almost
entirely
in
the
open
air
after
the
day
fishing
is
over
to
rest
awhile
in
the
cool
manor
house
hard
by
the
stream
watching
from
the
window
of
the
little
room
the
wonders
of
creation
in
the
garden
through
which
the
river
flows
now
from
the
recesses
of
the
overhanging
boughs
on
the
tiny
island
opposite
a
moorhen
swims
forth
cackling
and
pecking
at
the
water
as
she
goes
she
is
followed
by
five
little
balls
of
black
fur
her
progeny
they
are
fairly
revelling
in
the
evening
sunlight
diving
playing
with
each
other
and
thoroughly
enjoying
life
up
on
the
bough
of
the
old
fir
bearing
its
heavy
mantle
of
ivy
from
base
to
topmost
twig
and
not
twenty
yards
from
the
window
a
thrush
sits
and
sings
you
must
watch
him
carefully
ere
you
assure
yourself
that
those
sweet
trilling
notes
of
peerless
music
come
from
that
tiny
throat
a
rare
lesson
in
voice
production
he
will
teach
you
deep
breathing
headnotes
clear
as
a
bell
and
effortless
as
only
three
or
four
singers
in
europe
can
produce
them
without
the
slightest
sense
of
strain
or
throatiness
such
are
the
songs
of
our
most
gifted
denizens
of
the
woods
what
a
wondrous
amount
of
life
is
visible
on
an
evening
such
as
this
among
the
nettles
beyond
the
brook
scores
of
rabbits
are
running
to
and
fro
some
sitting
up
on
their
haunches
with
ears
pricked
some
gamboling
round
the
lichened
trunk
of
the
weeping
ash
tree
out
of
the
water
are
rising
and
soaring
upwards
to
circle
round
the
topmost
branches
of
the
firs
looking
upwards
you
may
see
hundreds
of
them
dancing
in
unalloyed
delight
enjoying
their
brief
existence
in
this
beautiful
world
birds
of
many
kinds
swallows
and
swifts
sparrows
blackbirds
robins
and
wrens
all
and
sundry
are
busy
chasing
the
poor
as
soon
as
the
flies
emerge
from
their
husks
and
hover
above
the
surface
of
the
stream
many
of
them
are
snapped
up
but
the
trout
have
gone
down
they
are
fairly
gorged
for
the
day
they
will
not
trouble
the
fly
any
more
and
then
those
glorious
bicycle
rides
in
the
long
summer
evenings
when
scarcely
had
the
sun
gone
down
beyond
the
ridge
of
rolling
uplands
than
the
moon
almost
at
the
full
and
gorgeously
serene
cast
her
soft
mysterious
light
upon
a
silent
world
one
such
night
two
anglers
gliding
softly
through
the
ancient
village
of
bibury
dismounted
from
their
machines
and
stood
on
the
bridge
which
spans
the
river
coln
below
them
the
peaceful
waters
flowed
silently
onwards
with
all
the
smoothness
of
oil
save
that
ever
and
anon
rays
of
silvery
moonlight
fell
in
streaks
of
radiant
whiteness
upon
its
glassy
surface
from
beneath
the
bridge
comes
the
sound
of
busy
waters
a
sound
as
is
often
the
case
with
running
water
that
you
do
not
hear
unless
you
listen
for
it
carefully
close
by
too
at
the
famous
spring
crystal
waters
are
welling
forth
from
the
rock
pure
and
stainless
as
they
were
a
thousand
years
ago
all
else
is
silent
in
the
village
the
sky
is
flecked
by
myriads
of
tiny
cloudlets
all
separate
from
each
other
and
mostly
of
one
shape
and
size
but
just
below
the
brilliant
orb
which
floats
serene
and
proud
above
the
line
of
mackerel
sky
fantastic
peaks
of
clouds
like
heights
of
rugged
alps
are
pointing
upwards
suddenly
there
comes
a
change
a
fairy
circle
of
prismatic
colour
is
gathering
round
the
moon
beautifying
the
scene
a
thousandfold
an
inner
girdle
of
hazy
emerald
hue
immediately
surrounds
the
lurid
orb
which
is
now
seen
as
in
a
glass
darkly
whilst
encircling
all
is
a
narrow
rim
of
red
light
like
the
rosy
hues
of
the
setting
sun
that
have
scarcely
died
away
in
the
west
the
beauty
of
this
lunar
rainbow
is
enhanced
by
the
framework
of
shapely
ash
trees
through
whose
branches
it
is
seen
along
the
river
bank
nestling
under
the
hanging
wood
are
rows
of
old
stone
cottages
with
gables
warped
a
little
on
one
side
one
light
shines
forth
from
the
lattice
window
of
the
ancient
mill
but
in
the
cool
houses
the
honest
peasants
are
slumbering
in
deep
peaceful
sleep
saw
i
never
felt
a
calm
so
deep
the
river
glideth
at
his
own
sweet
will
dear
god
the
very
houses
seem
asleep
wordsworth
we
are
in
the
very
heart
of
england
what
a
contrast
to
london
at
night
where
many
a
poor
fellow
must
be
tossing
restlessly
in
the
stifling
atmosphere
as
we
return
towards
the
old
manor
house
the
nightjar
or
goatsucker
is
droning
loudly
and
a
nightingale
actually
a
nightingale
is
singing
in
the
copse
these
birds
seldom
visit
us
in
the
cotswolds
in
the
deserted
garden
the
scent
of
hay
is
filling
the
air
and
the
moping
owl
doth
to
the
moon
complain
of
such
as
wander
near
her
secret
bower
as
we
go
we
pluck
some
sprigs
of
fragrant
honeysuckle
and
carry
them
indoors
and
so
to
bed
passing
on
the
broad
oak
staircase
the
weird
picture
of
the
man
who
built
this
rambling
old
house
more
than
three
hundred
years
ago
there
is
a
plain
everyday
phenomenon
connected
with
pictures
and
more
especially
photographs
which
must
have
been
noticed
time
after
time
by
thousands
of
people
yet
i
never
heard
it
mentioned
in
conversation
or
saw
it
in
print
i
allude
to
the
extraordinary
sympathy
the
features
of
a
portrait
are
capable
of
assuming
towards
the
expression
of
countenance
of
the
man
who
is
looking
at
it
there
is
something
at
times
almost
uncanny
in
it
stand
opposite
a
photograph
of
a
friend
when
you
are
feeling
sad
and
the
picture
is
sad
laugh
and
the
mouth
of
your
friend
seems
to
curl
into
a
smile
and
his
eyes
twinkle
merrily
relapse
into
gloom
and
despondency
and
the
smile
dies
away
from
the
picture
often
in
youth
when
about
to
carry
out
some
design
or
other
i
used
to
glance
at
my
late
father
portrait
and
never
failed
to
notice
a
look
of
approval
or
condemnation
on
the
face
which
left
its
mark
on
the
memory
for
a
considerable
time
the
countenance
of
the
grim
old
gentleman
in
the
portrait
on
the
stairs
aetatis
suae
wore
a
distinct
air
of
satisfaction
as
i
passed
by
on
my
way
to
bed
he
always
looks
pleased
after
there
has
been
a
good
day
with
the
hounds
and
likewise
in
the
summer
when

ix
burford
a
cotswold
town
burford
and
cirencester
are
two
typical
cotswold
towns
and
perhaps
the
is
the
most
characteristic
as
it
is
also
the
most
remote
and
of
all
places
in
this
part
of
england
it
was
on
a
lovely
day
in
june
that
we
resolved
to
go
and
explore
the
ancient
priory
and
glorious
church
of
old
burford
a
very
slow
train
sets
you
down
at
bampton
commonly
called
though
the
forest
which
gave
rise
to
the
name
has
long
since
given
place
to
open
fields
there
are
many
other
curious
names
of
this
type
in
gloucestershire
and
the
adjoining
counties
villages
of
the
same
name
are
often
distinguished
from
each
other
by
these
quaint
descriptions
of
their
various
situations
thus
distinguishes
from
distinguishes
from
distinguishes
from
then
we
find
and
and
and
it
may
be
noted
in
passing
that
the
derivation
of
the
word
has
ever
been
the
subject
of
much
controversy
but
the
fact
that
the
place
is
on
the
ancient
trackway
from
cirencester
to
the
north
and
also
that
four
counties
meet
here
is
sufficient
reason
for
assigning
the
place
on
the
moor
by
the
old
boundary
as
the
probable
meaning
of
the
name
we
were
fortunate
enough
to
secure
an
outside
seat
on
the
rickety
old
bus
which
plies
between
bampton
and
burford
and
were
soon
slowly
traversing
the
white
limestone
road
stopping
every
now
and
then
to
set
down
a
passenger
or
deposit
a
parcel
at
some
cottage
in
the
straggling
old
villages
it
was
indeed
a
glorious
morning
for
an
expedition
into
the
cotswolds
the
six
weeks
drought
had
just
given
place
to
cool
showery
weather
a
light
wind
from
the
west
breathed
the
fragrance
of
countless
wild
flowers
and
sweet
may
blossom
from
the
leafy
hedges
and
the
scent
of
roses
and
honeysuckle
was
wafted
from
every
cottage
garden
after
a
month
spent
amid
the
languid
air
and
depressing
surroundings
of
london
one
felt
glad
at
heart
to
experience
once
again
the
grand
pure
air
and
rural
scenery
of
the
cotswold
hills
what
strikes
one
so
forcibly
about
this
part
of
england
after
a
sojourn
in
some
smoky
town
is
its
extraordinary
cleanliness
there
is
no
such
thing
as
in
a
limestone
country
the
very
mud
off
the
roads
in
rainy
weather
is
not
dirt
at
all
sticky
though
it
undoubtedly
is
it
consists
almost
entirely
of
lime
which
though
it
burns
all
the
varnish
off
your
carriage
if
allowed
to
remain
on
it
for
a
few
days
has
nothing
repulsive
about
its
nature
like
ordinary
mud
how
pleasant
too
is
the
contrast
between
the
quiet
peaceful
country
life
and
the
restless
din
and
commotion
of
the
busy
haunts
of
men
as
we
pass
along
through
villages
gay
with
flowers
we
converse
freely
with
the
driver
of
the
chiefly
about
fishing
the
great
question
which
every
one
asks
in
this
part
of
the
world
in
the
first
week
in
june
is
whether
the
is
up
the
lovely
generally
appears
on
the
windrush
about
this
time
and
then
for
ten
days
nobody
thinks
or
talks
about
anything
else
who
that
has
ever
witnessed
a
real
rise
on
a
chalk
or
limestone
stream
will
deny
that
it
is
one
of
the
most
beautiful
and
interesting
sights
in
all
creation
myriads
of
transparent
insects
almost
as
large
as
butterflies
rising
out
of
the
water
and
floating
on
wings
as
light
as
gossamer
only
to
live
but
one
short
day
great
trout
flopping
and
rolling
in
all
directions
forgetful
of
all
the
wiles
of
which
they
are
generally
capable
and
then
when
the
evening
sun
is
declining
the
female
fly
may
be
seen
hovering
over
the
water
and
dropping
her
eggs
time
after
time
until
having
accomplished
the
only
purpose
for
which
she
has
existed
in
the
winged
state
she
falls
lifeless
into
the
stream
but
though
these
lovely
insects
live
but
hours
and
during
that
short
period
undergo
a
transformation
from
the
to
the
state
they
exist
as
larvae
in
the
bed
of
the
river
for
quite
two
years
from
the
time
the
eggs
are
dropped
the
season
of
was
one
of
the
worst
ever
known
on
some
rivers
probably
the
great
frost
two
winters
back
was
the
cause
of
failure
the
intense
cold
is
supposed
to
have
killed
the
larvae
the
windrush
trout
are
very
large
indeed
a
fish
is
not
at
all
uncommon
the
driver
of
the
talked
of
monsters
of
eight
pounds
having
been
taken
near
burford
but
we
took
this
grano
after
a
drive
we
suddenly
see
the
picturesque
old
town
below
us
like
most
of
the
villages
of
the
country
it
lies
in
one
of
the
narrow
valleys
which
intersect
the
hills
so
that
you
do
not
get
a
view
of
the
houses
until
you
arrive
at
the
edge
of
the
depression
in
which
they
are
built
having
paid
the
modest
shilling
which
represents
the
fare
for
the
five
miles
we
start
off
for
the
priory
there
was
no
difficulty
in
finding
our
way
to
it
in
all
the
cotswold
villages
and
small
towns
the
big
house
stands
out
conspicuously
among
the
old
cottages
and
barns
and
farmhouses
half
hidden
as
it
is
by
the
dense
foliage
of
giant
elms
and
beeches
and
chestnuts
and
ash
nor
is
burford
priory
an
exception
to
the
rule
though
its
grounds
are
guarded
by
a
wall
of
immense
height
on
one
side
and
then
once
more
we
get
the
view
we
have
seen
so
often
on
cotswold
yet
it
never
palls
upon
the
senses
but
thrills
us
with
its
own
mysterious
charm
who
can
ever
get
tired
of
the
picture
presented
by
a
gabled
mediaeval
house
set
in
a
framework
of
stately
trees
amid
whose
leafy
branches
the
rooks
are
cawing
and
chattering
round
their
ancestral
nests
whilst
down
below
the
fertilising
stream
silently
fulfils
its
task
flowing
onwards
everlastingly
caring
nothing
for
the
vicissitudes
of
our
transitory
life
and
the
hopes
and
fears
that
sway
the
hearts
of
successive
generations
of
men
there
the
old
house
stands
silent
in
the
shade
there
are
the
nursery
windows
but
the
children
voices
no
longer
break
the
silence
of
the
still
summer
day
everywhere
in
the
hall
in
the
where
the
empty
still
hang
and
in
my
lady
bower
sorrow
and
silence
and
sadness
are
hanging
over
all
until
we
arrived
within
a
few
yards
of
the
front
door
we
had
almost
forgotten
that
the
place
was
a
ruin
for
though
the
house
is
but
an
empty
shell
almost
as
hollow
as
a
skull
the
outer
walls
are
absolutely
complete
and
undamaged
at
one
end
is
the
beautiful
old
chapel
built
by
speaker
lenthall
in
the
time
of
the
commonwealth
there
is
an
air
of
sanctity
about
this
lovely
white
freestone
temple
which
no
amount
of
neglect
can
eradicate
the
roof
of
fine
stucco
work
has
fallen
in
the
elder
shrubs
grow
freely
through
the
crevices
in
the
broken
pavement
under
foot
and
yet
you
feel
bound
to
remove
your
hat
as
you
enter
for
you
are
standing
on
holy
ground
exue
calceos
nam
terra
est
sancta
over
the
entrance
stands
boldly
forth
this
solemn
inscription
whilst
angels
wonderfully
carved
in
white
stone
watch
and
guard
the
sacred
precincts
at
the
north
end
of
the
chapel
stands
intact
the
altar
and
strangely
enough
the
most
perfectly
preserved
remnants
of
the
whole
building
are
two
white
stone
tablets
plainly
setting
forth
the
ten
commandments
the
sun
as
we
stood
there
was
pouring
its
rays
through
the
graceful
mullioned
windows
lighting
up
the
delicate
carving
work
that
is
rendered
more
beautiful
than
ever
by
the
tender
grace
of
a
day
that
is
dead
whilst
outside
in
the
deserted
garden
the
birds
were
singing
sweetly
the
scene
was
sadly
impressive
one
felt
as
one
does
when
standing
by
the
grave
of
some
old
friend
as
we
passed
out
of
the
chapel
we
could
not
help
reflecting
on
the
of
men
fifty
years
ago
who
could
allow
this
consecrated
place
beautiful
and
fair
as
it
still
is
to
fall
gradually
to
the
ground
nor
attempt
to
put
forth
a
helping
hand
to
save
it
ere
it
crumbles
into
dust
how
ungrateful
it
seems
to
those
whose
labour
and
hard
toil
erected
it
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
ago
those
men
of
whom
ruskin
wrote
all
else
for
which
the
builders
sacrificed
has
passed
away
all
their
living
interests
and
aims
and
achievements
we
know
not
for
what
they
laboured
and
we
see
no
evidence
of
their
reward
victory
wealth
authority
happiness
all
have
departed
though
bought
by
many
a
bitter
sacrifice
it
should
be
mentioned
however
that
hurst
is
at
the
present
time
engaged
in
a
laudable
endeavour
to
restore
this
chapel
to
its
original
state
inside
the
house
the
most
noteworthy
feature
of
interest
is
a
remarkably
fine
ornamental
ceiling
good
judges
inform
us
that
the
ballroom
ceiling
at
burford
priory
is
one
of
the
finest
examples
of
old
work
of
the
kind
anywhere
to
be
seen
the
room
itself
is
a
very
large
and
one
the
oak
panels
which
completely
cover
the
walls
still
bear
the
marks
of
the
famous
portraits
that
once
adorned
them
charles
and
henry
prince
of
wales
by
cornelius
jansen
queen
henrietta
maria
by
vandyke
sir
thomas
more
and
his
family
by
holbein
speaker
lenthall
the
former
owner
of
the
house
and
many
other
fine
pictures
hung
here
in
former
times
the
staircase
is
a
fine
broad
one
of
oak
but
now
let
us
leave
the
inside
of
the
house
which
to
be
so
beautiful
and
bright
and
so
desolate
and
bare
for
it
is
of
no
great
age
and
let
us
call
to
mind
the
picture
which
waller
painted
engravings
of
which
used
to
adorn
so
many
oxford
rooms
the
empty
saddle
for
standing
in
the
neglected
garden
we
may
see
the
very
terrace
and
the
angle
of
the
house
which
were
drawn
so
beautifully
by
him
then
as
we
stroll
through
the
deserted
grounds
towards
the
peaceful
windrush
where
the
great
trout
are
still
sucking
down
the
poor
let
us
try
to
recollect
what
manner
of
men
used
to
walk
in
these
peaceful
gardens
in
the
old
stirring
times
little
or
nothing
is
known
of
the
monastery
which
doubtless
existed
somewhere
hereabouts
prior
to
the
dissolution
in
henry
viii
reign
up
to
the
conquest
the
manor
of
burford
was
held
by
saxon
noblemen
it
is
mentioned
in
doomsday
book
as
belonging
to
earl
aubrey
but
the
first
notable
man
who
held
it
was
hugh
le
despencer
this
man
was
one
of
edward
ii
favourites
and
was
ultimately
hung
by
the
command
at
the
same
time
that
edward
was
committed
to
kenilworth
castle
burford
remained
with
his
descendants
till
the
reign
of
henry
when
it
passed
by
marriage
to
a
still
more
notable
man
in
the
person
of
richard
neville
earl
of
warwick
the
kingmaker
space
does
not
allow
us
to
romance
on
the
part
that
this
great
warrior
played
in
the
history
of
those
times
lord
lytton
has
done
that
for
us
in
his
splendid
book
the
last
of
the
barons
suffice
it
to
say
that
he
left
an
undying
fame
to
future
generations
and
fell
in
the
wars
of
the
roses
when
fighting
at
the
battle
of
barnet
against
the
very
man
he
had
set
on
the
throne
the
almshouses
he
built
for
burford
are
still
to
be
seen
hard
by
the
grand
old
church
for
who
lived
king
but
i
could
dig
his
grave
and
who
durst
smile
when
warwick
bent
his
brow
lo
now
my
glory
smear
in
dust
and
blood
my
parks
my
walks
my
manors
that
i
had
even
now
forsake
me
and
of
all
my
lands
is
nothing
left
me
but
my
body
length
henry
ii
in
the
reign
of
henry
viii
this
manor
having
lapsed
to
the
crown
was
granted
to
edmund
harman
the
royal
surgeon
then
in
later
days
sir
john
fortescue
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
to
queen
elizabeth
got
hold
of
it
and
eventually
sold
it
to
sir
lawrence
tanfield
a
great
judge
in
those
times
the
latter
was
buried
at
twelve
in
the
night
in
the
church
of
burford
and
there
is
a
very
handsome
aisle
there
and
an
immense
monument
to
his
memory
the
tanfield
monument
though
somewhat
ugly
and
grotesque
is
a
wonderful
example
of
alabaster
work
the
cost
of
erecting
it
and
the
labour
bestowed
must
have
been
immense
it
was
this
knight
who
built
the
great
house
of
which
the
present
ruins
form
part
and
the
date
would
probably
be
about
but
in
nearly
half
the
original
building
is
supposed
to
have
been
pulled
down
and
what
was
allowed
to
remain
with
the
exception
of
the
chapel
has
been
very
much
altered
it
was
in
the
time
of
lucius
carey
second
lord
falkland
ownership
of
this
manor
that
the
place
was
in
the
zenith
of
its
fame
this
accomplished
man
whose
father
had
married
chief
justice
only
daughter
succeeded
his
grandfather
in
the
year
he
gathered
together
either
here
or
at
great
tew
a
few
miles
away
half
the
literary
celebrities
of
the
day
ben
jonson
cowley
and
chillingworth
all
visited
falkland
from
time
to
time
lucius
carey
afterwards
became
the
king
charles
secretary
of
state
an
office
which
he
conscientiously
filled
until
his
untimely
death
falkland
left
little
literary
work
behind
him
of
any
mark
yet
of
no
other
man
of
those
times
may
it
be
said
that
so
great
a
reputation
for
ability
and
character
has
been
handed
down
to
us
novelists
and
authors
delight
in
dwelling
on
his
good
qualities
even
in
this
jubilee
year
of
the
author
of
sir
kenelm
digby
has
written
a
book
about
the
falklands
whyte
melville
too
made
him
the
hero
of
one
of
his
novels
describing
him
as
a
man
in
whose
outward
appearance
there
were
no
indications
of
the
intellectual
superiority
he
enjoyed
over
his
fellow
men
indeed
as
with
arthur
hallam
in
our
own
times
so
it
was
with
falkland
in
the
mediaeval
age
neither
left
behind
them
any
work
of
their
own
by
which
future
generations
could
realise
their
abilities
and
almost
godlike
charm
yet
each
has
earned
a
kind
of
immortality
through
being
honoured
and
sung
by
the
pens
of
the
greatest
writers
of
his
respective
age
that
great
though
somewhat
bombastic
historian
lord
clarendon
tells
us
that
falkland
was
a
person
of
such
prodigious
parts
of
learning
and
knowledge
of
that
inimitable
sweetness
and
delight
in
conversation
of
so
flowing
and
obliging
a
humanity
and
goodness
to
mankind
and
of
that
primitive
simplicity
and
integrity
of
life
that
if
there
were
no
other
brand
upon
this
odious
and
accursed
civil
war
than
that
single
loss
it
must
be
most
infamous
and
execrable
to
all
posterity
from
the
same
authority
we
learn
that
although
he
was
ever
anxious

he
was
the
bravest
of
the
brave
at
the
battle
of
newbury
he
put
himself
in
the
first
rank
of
lord
byron
regiment
when
he
met
his
end
through
a
musket
shot
thus
says
clarendon
fell
that
incomparable
young
man
in
the
year
of
his
age
having
so
much
despatched
the
true
business
of
life
that
the
eldest
rarely
attain
to
that
immense
knowledge
and
the
youngest
enter
not
into
the
world
with
more
innocency
when
it
is
remembered
that
falkland
was
not
a
soldier
at
all
but
a
learned
scholar
whose
natural
proclivities
were
literature
and
the
arts
of
peace
his
and
bravery
can
not
fail
to
call
forth
admiration
for
the
man
and
we
can
not
but
regret
his
untimely
end
king
charles
was
several
times
at
burford
for
it
was
the
scene
of
much
fighting
in
the
civil
wars
it
was
in
the
year
that
speaker
lenthall
purchased
burford
priory
he
was
a
man
of
note
in
those
troublous
times
and
even
cromwell
seems
to
have
respected
him
for
although
the
latter
came
down
to
the
house
one
day
with
a
troop
of
musketeers
with
the
express
intention
of
turning
the
gallant
speaker
out
of
his
chair
and
effected
his
object
amid
the
proverbial
cries
of
make
way
for
honester
men
yet
we
find
that
within
twelve
months
the
crafty
old
gentleman
had
once
more
got
back
again
into
the
chair
and
remained
speaker
during
the
protectorate
of
richard
cromwell
he
declared
on
his
deathbed
that
although
like
saul
he
held
the
clothes
of
the
murderers
yet
that
he
never
consented
to
the
death
of
the
king
but
was
deceived
by
cromwell
and
his
agents
the
priory
remained
in
the
lenthall
family
up
to
the
year
at
the
present
time
it
belongs
to
the

family
we
have
now
briefly
traced
the
history
of
the

from
the
time
of
the
conquest
and
doubtless
all
the
men
whose
names
occur
have
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
on
this
beautiful

that

that
in

it
was
in

that
the

meeting
was
transferred
to

then
sitting

macaulay
tells
us
that
two
of
the
famous
saddles
were
presented
to
this
monarch
and
remarks
that
one
of
the
burford
saddlers
was
the
best
in

how
gay
burford
was
a
hundred
years
ago
those
were
bibury
very
best
days
in
addition
to
the
presence
of

then
prince
of

who
was
received
by

for

at
his

in

and
who
every
day
appeared
on

as
a
private

there
was
a
galaxy
of
gentlemen

who
alone
rode
at

their

whereas
up

fifty
years
ago
burford
was
a
rich
country
town
famous
for
the
manufacture
of
paper
malt
and
sailcloth
enriched
too
by
the
constant
passage
of
numerous
coaches
stopping
on
their
way
from
oxford
to
gloucester
it
is
now
little
more
than
a
village
the
quietest
the
cleanest
and
the
quaintest
place
in
oxfordshire
perhaps
its
citizens
are
to
be
envied
rather
than
pitied

us
go
up
to
the

now
we
may
exclaim
with

of

for
yonder

the

fought
a

battle
in

quite
recently
a

was
found
there
containing
a
stone
coffin
weighing
nearly
a

the
bones
of
the
warrior
who
fought
and
died
there
were
marvellously
complete
when
disturbed
in

the
skeleton
was
a
perfect

whose
fame
is
in
that
dark
green
tomb
four
stones
with

stand
there
they
mark

footnote
ossian
tradition
has
it
that
this
was
the
body
of
a
great
saxon
chief
aethelhum
the
mighty
of
the
mercian
king
ethelbald
it
was
in
honour
of
this
great
warrior
that
the
people
of
burford
carried
a
standard
emblazoned
with
a
golden
dragon
through
the
old
streets
on
midsummer
eve
annually
for
nigh
on
a
thousand
years
we
are
told
that
it
was
only
during
last
century
that
the
custom
died
out
how
beautiful
are
some
of
the
old
houses
in
the
broad
and
stately
high
street
the
ancient
building
in
the
centre
of
the
town
is
called
the
tolsey
it
must
be
more
than
four
hundred
years
old
the
name
originated
in
the
custom
of
paying
tolls
due
to
the
lord
of
the
manor
in
the
building
there
are
some
grand
old
iron
chests
here
one
of
these
old
boxes
contains
many
interesting
charters
and
deeds
some
of
them
bearing
the
signatures
of
chancellors
morton
stephen

there
are
letters
from
elizabeth

from
the

with
arlington
signature
attached
the
stocks
used
to
stand
on
the
north
side
of
this
building
but
have
lately
been
removed
then
the
houses
opposite
the
tolsey
are
as
beautiful
as
they
possibly
can
be
they
are
fifteenth
century
and
have
oak
round
their
gables
carved
in
very
delicate
tracery
another
house
has
a
wonderful
cellar
filled
with
grandly
carved
stonework
like
the
aisle
of
a
church
this
crypt
is
probably
more
than
five
hundred
years
old
perhaps
this
vaulted
gothic
chamber
is
a
remnant
of
the
old
monastery
the
site
of
which
is
not
known
close
by
is
an
ancient
building
now
turned
into
an
inn
and
this
also
may
have
been
part
of
the
of
the
monks
of
burford
from
the
vaulted
cellar
beneath
the
house
now
occupied
by
chandler
ran
an
underground
passage
evidently
connected
with
some
other
building
how
sweetly
pretty
is
the
house
at
the
foot
of
the

seen
from

to
the

that
they
were
founded
by
richard
earl
of
warwick
the
kingmaker
in
the

they
were
practically
rebuilt
about
seventy
years
ago
but
remnants
of
beautiful
gothic
architecture
still
remain
in
the
old
stone
belfry
and
here
and
there
a
piece
of
tracery
has
been
preserved
in
all
parts
of
the

oriel
windows
are
also

behind
the
almshouses
is
a
cottage
with
massive
buttresses
and
everywhere
broken
pieces
of
quaint
gargoyles
pinnacles
and
other
remnants
of
gothic
workmanship
are
to
be
seen
lying
about
on
the
walls
and
in
odd
corners
a
careful
search
would
doubtless
reveal
many
a
fine
piece
of
tracery
in
the
cottages
and
buildings
at
some
period
however
vandalism
has
evidently
been
rampant
happening
to
find
our
way
into
the
back
premises
of
an
ancient
inn
we
noticed
that
the
coals
were
heaped
up
against
a
wall
of
old
oak
panelling
and
now
we
come
to
the
most
beautiful
piece
of
architecture
in
the
place
the
magnificent
old
church
it
is
grandly
situated
close
to
the
banks
of
the
windrush
and
is
more
like
a
cathedral
than
a
village
church
the
front
of
the
porch
is
worked
with
figures
representing
our
lord
mary
magdalene
and
john
the
evangelist
but
the
heads
were
unfortunately
destroyed
in
the
civil
wars
inside
the
porch
the
rich
which
rises
from
the
pilasters
on
each
side
is
carved
with
consummate
skill
space
does
not
allow
us
to
dwell
on
the
grandeur
of
the
massive
norman
tower
the
great
doorway
at
the
western
entrance
with
its
splendid
moulding
the
quaint
low
arch
leading
from
nave
to
chancel
and
the
other
specimens
of
norman
work
to
be
seen
in
all
parts
of
this
magnificent
edifice
nor
can
we
do
justice
to
the
glorious
nave
with
its
roof
of
oak
nor
the
aisles
and
the
chancel
nor
the
beautiful
leggare
chapel
with
its
oak
screen
carved
in
its
upper
part
in
tracery
its
faded
frescoes
and
ancient
altar
tomb
the
glass
of
the
upper
portion
of
the
great
west
window
and
the
window
of
st
thomas
chapel
are
indeed
labyrinths
of
twisted
tracery
and
starry
light
such
as
would
delight
the
fastidious
taste
of
ruskin
several
pages
might
easily
be
written
in
describing
the
wonderful
and
grotesque
example
of
alabaster
work
known
as
the
tanfield
tomb
the
only
regret
one
feels
on
gazing
at
this
grand
old
specimen
of
the
toil
of
our
simple
ancestors
is
that
it
is
seldom
visited
save
by
the
natives
of
rural
burford
many
of
whom
alas
must
realise
but
little
the
exceptional
beauty
and
stateliness
of
the
lovely
old
church
with
which
they
have
been
so
familiar
all
their
lives
a
few
years
ago

through

in

these
high
wild
hills
and
rough
uneven
ways
draw
out
our
miles
and
make
them
wearisome
richard
it
can
not
be
said
that
there
are
many
pleasant
walks
and
drives
in
the
cotswold
country
because
as
a
rule
the
roads
run
over
the
bleak
tableland
for
miles
and
miles
and
the
landscape
generally
consists
of
ploughed
fields
divided
by
grey
stone
walls
the
downs
i
have
referred
to
at
different
times
are
only
to
be
met
with
in
certain
districts
once
upon
a
time
the
whole
of
cotswold
was
one
vast
sheep
walk
from
beginning
to
end
it
was
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
ago
that
the
idea
of
enclosing
the
land
was
started
by
the
first
lord
bathurst
early
in
the
eighteenth
century
he
converted
a
large
tract
of
downland
round
cirencester
into
arable
fields
his
example
was
soon
followed
by
others
so
that
by
the
middle
of
last
century
the
transformation
of
three
hundred
square
miles
of
downs
into
ploughed
fields
had
been
accomplished
it
is
chiefly
owing
to
the
depression
in
agricultural
produce
that
there
are
any
downs
now
for
they
merely
exist
because
the
tenants
have
found
during
the
last
twenty
years
that
it
does
not
pay
to
cultivate
their
farms
hence
they
let
a
large
proportion
go
back
to
grass
but
there
is
one
very
pleasant
walk
in
that
part
of
the
cotswolds
we
know
best
and
this
takes
you
up
the
valley
of
the
coln
to
the
roman
villa
at
chedworth
the
distance
by
road
from
fairford
to
the
chedworth
woods
is
about
twelve
miles
and
at
any
time
of
the
year
but
more
especially
in
the
spring
and
autumn
it
is
a
truly
delightful
pilgrimage
and
here
it
is
worth
our
while
to
consider
for
a
moment
how
tremendously
the
abolition
of
the
stage
coach
has
affected
places
like
fairford
burford
and
other
cotswold
towns
and
villages
it
was
through
these
places
past
these
very
walls
and
gables
that
the
mail
coaches
rattled
day
after
day
when
they
went
down
with
victory
conveying
the
news
of
waterloo
and
trafalgar
into
the
heart
of
merry
england
in
his
immortal
essay
on
the
english
mail
coach
de
quincey
has
told
us
how
between
the
years
and
it
was
worth
paying
down
five
years
of
life
for
an
outside
place
on
a
coach
going
down
with
victory
on
any
night
the
spectacle
was
beautiful
the
absolute
perfection
of
all
the
appointments
about
the
carriages
and
the
harness
their
strength
their
brilliant
cleanliness
their
beautiful
simplicity
but
more
than
all
the
royal
magnificence
of
the
horses
were
what
might
first
have
fixed
the
attention
but
the
night
before
us
is
a
night
of
victory
and
behold
to
the
ordinary
display
what
a
addition
horses
men
carriages
all
are
dressed
in
laurels
and
flowers
oak
leaves
and
ribbons
the
brilliancy
of
the
royal
liveries
the
thundering
of
the
wheels
the
tramp
of
those
generous
horses
the
sounding
of
the
coach
horn
in
the
calm
evening
air
and
last
but
not
least
the
intense
enthusiasm
of
travellers
and
spectators
alike
as
amid
such
cries
as
salamanca
for
ever
hurrah
for
waterloo
they
cheered
and
cheered
again
letting
slip
the
dogs
of
victory
throughout
those
old
english
villages
all
these
things
must
have
united
the
hearts
of
the
classes
and
masses
in
one
common
bond
rendering
such
occasions
memorable
for
ever
in
the
hearts
of
the
simple
country
folk
in
small
towns
like
burford
and
northleach
situated
five
or
six
miles
from
any
railway
station
the
prosperity
and
happiness
of
the
natives
has
suffered
enormously
by
the
decay
of
the
stage
coach
and
even
in
smaller
villages
the
cheering
sound
of
the
horn
must
have
been
very
welcome
forming
as
it
did
a
connecting
link
between
these
remote
hamlets
of
gloucestershire
and
the
great
metropolis
a
hundred
miles
away
fairford
church
is
known
far
and
wide
as
containing
the
most
beautiful
painted
glass
of
the
early
part
of
the
sixteenth
century
to
be
found
anywhere
in
england
the
windows
in
number
are
usually
attributed
to
albert
dürer
but
joyce
who
published
a
treatise
on
them
some
twenty
years
ago
together
with
certain
other
high
authorities
considered
them
to
be
of
english
design
and
workmanship
they
would
doubtless
have
been
destroyed
in
the
time
of
the
civil
wars
by
the
puritans
had
they
not
been
taken
down
and
hidden
away
by
a
member
of
the
oldysworth
family
whose
tomb
is
in
the
middle
chancel
john
tame
having
purchased
the
manor
of
fairford
in
immediately
set
about
building
the
church
he
died
two
years
later
and
his
son
completed
the
building
and
also
erected
two
other
very
fine
churches
in
the
neighbourhood
those
at
rendcombe
and
barnsley
he
was
a
great
benefactor
to
the
cotswold
country
leland
tells
us
that
the
town
of
fairford
never
flourished
before
the
cumming
of
the
tames
into
it
you
may
see
john
tame
effigy
on
his
tomb
together
with
that
of
his
wife
and
underneath
these
pathetic
lines
for
thus
love
pray
for

i
may
not
pray
more
pray

a

noster
and
an
ave

my

i
remember
rightly
his
helmet
and
other
parts
of
his
armour
still
hang
on
the
church
wall
leland
describes
fairford
as
a
praty
uplandish
towne
meaning
i
suppose
that
it
is
situated
on
high
ground
it
is
certainly
a
delightful
place
a
very
good
type
of
what
the
cotswold
towns
are
like
and
burford
are
however
the
two
most
typical
cotswold
towns
i
know
in
the
year
a
remarkable
discovery
was
made
in
a
field
close
to
fairford
no
less
than
a
hundred
and
fifty
skeletons
were
unearthed
and
with
them
a
large
number
of
very
interesting
relics
some
of
them
in
good
preservation
in
many
of
the
graves
an
iron
knife
was
found
lying
by
the
skeleton
in
others
the
bodies
were
decorated
with
bronze
fibulae
richly
gilt
and
ornamented
in
front
wylie
in
his
interesting
account
of
these
graves
tells
us
that
some
of
the
bodies
were
as
large
as
six
feet
six
inches
whilst
one
or
two
warriors
of
seven
feet
were
unearthed
all
the
skeletons
were
very
perfect
even
though
no
signs
of
any
coffins
were
to
be
seen
bronze
bowls
and
various
kinds
of
pottery
spearheads
of
several
shapes
a
large
number
of
coloured
beads
bosses
of
shields
knives
shears
and
two
remarkably
fine
swords
were
some
of
the
relics
found
with
the
bodies
a
glass
vessel
coloured
yellow
by
means
of
a
chemical
process
in
which
iron
was
utilised
is
considered
by
wylie
to
be
of
saxon
manufacture
and
not
venetian
or
roman
as
other
authorities
hold
whether
this
is
merely
an
or
whether
the
bodies
are
those
of
the
warriors
who
fell
in
a
great
battle
such
as
that
fought
in
when
the
saxons
overthrew
the
britons
and
took
from
them
the
cities
of
gloucester
cirencester
and
bath
it
is
impossible
to
determine
the
natives
are
firmly
convinced
that
the
skeletons
represent
the
slain
in
a
great
battle
fought
near
this
spot
but
this
is
only
tradition
at
all
events
the
words
of
prophecy
attributed
to
the
old
scotch
bard
ossian
have
a
very
literal
application
with
reference
to
this
interesting
relic
of
bygone
times
the
stranger
shall
come
and
build
there
and
remove
the
earth
an
sword
shall
rise
before
him
bending
above
it
he
will
say
are
the
arms
of
the
chiefs
of
old
but
their
names
are
not
in
song
the
earth
has
long
ago
disappeared
for
there
are
no
barrows
now
to
be
seen
cottages
stand
where
the
old
burial
mounds
doubtless
once
existed
and
all
monumental
evidences
of
those
mighty
men
the
last
perhaps
of
an
ancient
race
have
long
since
been
destroyed
by
the
ruthless
hand
of
time
the
manor
of
fairford
now
belongs
to
the
barker
family
to
whom
it
came
through
the
female
line
about
a
century
ago
we
must
now
leave
fairford
and
start
on
our
pilgrimage
to
the
roman
villa
of
chedworth
at
present
we
have
not
got
very
far
having
lingered
at
our
longer
than
we
had
intended
the
first
two
miles
are
the
least
interesting
of
the
whole
journey
the
coln
broadened
out
for
some
distance
to
the
size
of
a
lake
is
hidden
from
our
view
by
the
tall
trees
of
fairford
park
it
was
along
this
road
that
john
keble
the
poet
used
to
walk
day
by
day
to
his
cure

his
home

at

two
eminent

made
their
home
in

recent
years

on
reaching
quenington
we
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
river
whilst
high
up
on
the
hill
to
our
right
stands
the
great
pile
of
hatherop

this
place
the
present
owner
of
which
is
sir
thomas

formerly
belonged
to
the
nunnery
of

after
the
suppression

monasteries
it
passed
through
various
heiresses

rebuilt
by
william

lord

ashley
ponsonby
sold
it
to
prince
duleep
singh
from
whom
it
passed
to
the
present
owner
sir
thomas
bazley
has
done
much
for
the
village
which
is
fortunate
enough
to
claim
him
as
a
resident
his
estate
is
a
model
of
what
country
estates
ought
to
be
unprofitable
though
it
must
have
proved
as
an
investment
as
we
pass
on
through
the
fair
villages
of
quenington
and
we
can
not
help
noticing
the
delightful
character
of
the
houses
from
a
picturesque
point
of
view
in
both
these
hamlets
there
are
the
same
stone
cottages
and
roofs
here
and
there
the
newer
cottages
are
roofed
with
ordinary
slate
and
this
seems
a
pity
nevertheless
there
still
remains
much
that
is
picturesque
to
be
seen
on
all
sides
roses
grow
in
every
garden
clematis
relieves
with
its
rich
purple
shade
the
walls
of
many
a
cosy
little
and
the
old
white
mills
with
their
latticed
windows
and
pointed
gables
are
a
feature
of
every
tiny
hamlet
through
which
the
river
flows
how
gay
the
habitations
that
adorn
this
fertile
valley
not
a
house
but
seems
to
give
assurance
of
content
within
embosom
happiness
and
placid
love

close
to

the
remnants

the

templar
of

were
famous
in
times

by
there
is
a
fine
entrance
gate

on

which
no
doubt
led
to
the
abbey
there
is
little
else
left
to
remind
us
of

there

an

a
little
piece

an

these
are
all
the
remnants
to
be
found
of
the
days
of
chivalry
and
the
monks
of
old
we
have
now
two
rather
uneventful
miles
to
traverse
between
and
bibury
for
we
must
once
more
leave
the
valley
and
set
out
across
the
bleak
uplands
on
the
high
ground
we
have
the
advantage
of
splendid
bracing
air
at
all
events
the
hills
have
a
charm
of
their
own
on
a
fine
day
more
especially
when
the
fields
are
full
of
golden
corn
and
the
cotswold
men
are
busy
among
the
sheaves
and
very
soon
we
get
a
view
which
we
would
gladly
have
walked
twenty
miles
to
see
down
below
us
and
not
more
than
half
a
mile
away
is
the
fine
old
elizabethan
house
of
bibury
standing
out
from
a
background
of
magnificent
trees
close
to
the
house
is
the
grey
norman
tower
of
the
village
church
which
has
stood
there
for
mote
than
six
centuries
nestling
round
about
are
the
old
cottages
like
those
we
have
seen
in
the
other
villages
we
have
passed
through
a
broad
reach
of
the
coln
and
a
grand
waterfall
enhance
the
quiet
and
peaceful
beauty
of
the
scene
but
this
description
falls
very
short
of
conveying
any
adequate
idea
of
the
truly
delightful
effect
which
the
old
grey
buildings
set
in
a
framework
of
wood
and
water
present
on
a
fine
autumnal
afternoon
never
shall
i
forget
seeing
this
old
place
from
the
hill
above
during
one
september
sunset
there
was
a
marvellous
glow
suffused
over
the
western
sky
infinitely
beautiful
while
it
lasted
and
immediately
below
a
silvery
mist
had
risen
from
the
surface
of
the
broad
trout
stream
and
was
hanging
over
the
old
norman
tower
of
the
church
amid
the
rush
of
the
waterfall
could
be
heard
the
distant
voices
of
children
in
the
village
street
then
on
a
sudden
the
church
clock
struck
the
hour
of
six
in
deep
solemn
tones
against
the
woods
in
the
background
the
old
court
house
stood
out
grey
and
silent
under
the
shadow
of
the
church
tower
preaching
as
good
a
sermon
as
any
i
ever
heard
an
english
home
grey
twilight
poured
on
dewy
pastures
dewy
trees
softer
than
sleep
all
things
in
order
stored
a
haunt
of
ancient
peace
bibury
court
is
a
most
beautiful
old
house
some
of
it
dates
back
to
henry
viii
time
the
most
remarkable
characteristic
of
its
interior
is
a
very
fine
carved
oak
staircase
the
greater
part
of
this
house
was
built
in
the
year
by
sir
thomas
sackville
it
was
long
the
seat
of
the
creswell
family
before
passing
by
purchase
to
the
family
of
the
present
owner
lord
sherborne
the
fine
old
church
has
some
saxon
work
in
it
whilst
the
doorways
and
many
other
portions
are
norman
its
delightful
simplicity
and
brightness
is
what
pleases
one
most
on
coming
down
into
the
village
one
notices
a
little
square
on
the
left
not
at
all
like
those
one
sees
in
london
but
very
picturesque
and
clean
looking
in
the
olden
times
were
to
be
seen
in
many
villages
little
courts
of
this
kind
in
the
centre
of
them
was
usually
a
great
tree
round
which
the
old
people
would
sit
on
summer
evenings
while
the
children
danced
and
played
around
gilbert
white
speaks
of
one
at
selborne
which
he
calls
the
plestor
the
original
name
was
pleystow
which
means
a
play
place
we
have
noticed
them
in
many
parts
of
the
cotswold
country
here
too
children
are
playing
about
under
the
shade
of
some
delightful
trees
in
the
centre
of
the
miniature
square
whilst
the
variegated
foliage
sets
off
the
gabled
cottages
which
form
three
sides
of
it
i
have
often
wondered
as
i
stood
by
these
chestnut
trees
whether
there
is
any
architecture
more
perfect
in
its
simplicity
and
grace
than
that
which
lies
around
me
here
not
a
cottage
is
in
sight
that
is
not
worthy
of
the
painter
brush
not
a
gable
or
a
chimney
that
would
not
be
worthy
of
a
place
in
the
royal
academy
the
little
square
is
bordered
for
six
months
of
the
year
with
the
prettiest
of
flowers
even
as
late
as
december
you
may
see
roses
in
bloom
on
the
walls
and
chrysanthemums
of
varied
shade
in
every
garden
then
as
we
passed
onwards
on
the
stream
bank
and
everywhere
appeared
fair
dwellings
single
or
in
social
knots
some
scattered
the
level
others
on
the
a
cheerful
quiet
scene
wordsworth
there
is
a
gothic
quaintness
about
all
the
buildings
in
the
cotswolds
great
and
small
alike
which
is
very
charming
bibury
is
indeed
a
pretty
village
as
you
walk
along
the
main
street
which
runs
parallel
with
the
river
an
angler
is
busy
swishing
his
rod
violently
in
the
air
to
dry
the
fly
ere
he
essays
to
drop
it
over
the
nose
of
one
of
the
speckled
fario
which
abound
so
be
careful
to
step
down
off
the
path
which
runs
alongside
the
stream
in
case
you
should
put
the
fish
down
and
spoil
the
sport
and
now
on
our
left
beyond
the
green
may
be
seen
a
line
of
gabled
cottages
called
arlington
row
a
picture
of
which
by
leslie
was
hung
at
the
royal
academy
this
year
a
few
hundred
yards
on
you
stop
to
inspect
the
spring
which
rises
in
the
garden
of
the
swan
hotel
it
has
been
said
that
two
million
gallons
a
day
is
the
minimum
amount
of
water
poured
out
by
this
spring
it
consists
of
the
rain
which
falling
on
a
large
area
of
the
hill
country
gradually
finds
its
way
through
the
limestone
rocks
and
eventually
comes
out
here
it
would
be
interesting
to
trace
the
course
of
some
of
these
underground
rivers
for
a
torrent
of
water
such
as
this
can
not
flow
down
through
the
soft
rock
without
in
the
course
of
thousands
of
years
producing
caves
and
grottoes
and
underground
galleries
and
all
the
wonders
of
the
mammoth
cave
in
kentucky
with
its
stalactite
pillars
and
fairy
avenues
and
domes
though
the
cotswold
caves
are
naturally
on
a
much
smaller
scale
at
torquay
and
on
the
mendip
hills
as
everybody
knows
there
are
caves
of
wondrous
beauty
carved
by
the
water
within
the
living
rock
probably
within
a
hundred
yards
of
bibury
spring
there
are
beautiful
hidden
caves
such
as
those
funny
little
palaeolithic
men
lived
in
a
few
thousand
years
ago
but
why
there
have
not
been
more
discoveries
of
this
nature
in
this
part
of
the
cotswolds
it
is
difficult
to
say
there
is
a
cave
hereabouts
men
say
but
the
entrance
to
it
can
not
now
be
found
there
is
likewise
a
roman
villa
on
the
hill
here
which
has
not
yet
been
dug
out
of
its
earthy
bed
a
hundred
years
ago
a
large
number
of
roman
antiquities
were
discovered
near
this
village
we
now
leave
bibury
behind
us
and
a
mile
on
we
pass
through
the
hamlet
of
ablington
which
is
very
like
bibury
on
a
smaller
scale
with
its
ancient
cottages
tithe
barns
and
manor
house
its
springs
of
transparent
water
its
brook
and
wealth
of
fine
old
trees
we
have
no
time
to
linger
in
this
hamlet
though
we
would
fain
pause
to
admire
the
old
house
the
pillar
porch
elaborately
embossed
the
low
wide
windows
with
their
mullions
old
the
cornice
richly
fretted
of
grey
stone
and
that
smooth
slope
from
which
the
dwelling
rose
by
beds
and
banks
arcadian
of
gay
flowers
and
flowering
shrubs
protected
and
adorned
wordsworth
after
leaving
ablington
we
once
more
ascend
the
hill
and
make
our
way
along
an
old
disused
road
probably
an
ancient
british
track
in
preference
to
keeping
to
the
highway
in
the
first
place
because
it
is
by
far
the
shortest
and
secondly
because
we
intend
to
go
somewhat
out
of
our
way
to
inspect
two
ancient
barrows
the
of
the
chiefs
of
old
of
whom
ossian
or
was
it
macpherson
sang
if
fall
i
must
in
the
field
raise
high
my
grave
grey
stones
and
earth
shall
mark
me
to
future
times
when
the
hunter
shall
sit
by
the
mound
and
produce
his
food
at
noon
warrior
rests
here
he
will
say
and
my
fame
shall
live
in
his
praise
footnote
in
spite
of
johnson
and
other
eminent
critics
one
can
not
help
believing
in
the
genuineness
of
some
of
the
poems
attributed
to
ossian
the
proof
of
the
pudding
is
in
the
eating
and
those
wonderful
old
songs
are
too
wild
and
lifelike
to
have
had
their
origin
in
the
eighteenth
century
macpherson
doubtless
enlarged
upon
the
originals
but
he
must
have
had
a
good
foundation
to
work
upon
a
very
large
barrow
lies
about
a
mile
out
of
our
track
to
the
right
hand
as
it
is
somewhat
different
from
the
other
barrows
in
the
neighbourhood
we
will
briefly
describe
it
it
is
a
long
barrow
with
the
two
horns
at
one
end
that
are
usually
associated
with
long
barrows
in
the
middle
of
the
curve
between
these
ends
stands
a
great
stone
about
five
feet
square
not
very
unlike
our
own
gravestones
though
worn
by
the
rains
of
thousands
of
years
the
mound
is
surrounded
by
a
double
wall
of
masonry
at
the
north
end
when
it
was
opened
forty
years
ago
a
chamber
was
found
containing
human
bones
it
is
supposed
that
this
mound
was
the
of
a
race
which
dwelt
on
cotswold
at
least
three
thousand
years
ago
from
the
nature
of
the
stone
implements
found
it
is
conjectured
that
the
people
who
raised
it
were
unacquainted
with
the
use
of
metal
now
we
will
have
a
look
at
another
barrow
a
few
fields
away
this
is
a
mound
of
a
somewhat
later
age
for
it
was
raised
over
the
ashes
of
a
body
or
bodies
that
had
been
cremated
it
was
probably
the
celts
who
raised
this
barrow
the
other
day
it
was
opened
for
a
distinguished
society
of
antiquaries
to
inspect
they
found
that
in
the
centre
were
stones
carefully
laid
encircling
a
small
chamber
whilst
the
outer
portions
were
of
ordinary
rubble
nothing
but
and
dirt
was
found
in
the
chamber
but
in
the
course
of
thousands
of
years
most
of
these
barrows
have
probably
been
opened
a
good
many
times
by
cotswold
natives
in
search
of
golden
coffins
and
other
treasures
there
is
a
small
round
underground
chamber
within
a
short
distance
of
these
barrows
which
the
natives
consider
to
be
a
shepherd
hut
put
up
about
two
centuries
back
and
before
the
country
was
enclosed
as
a
retreat
to
shelter
the
men
who
looked
after
the
flocks
it
has
been
declared
however
by
those
who
have
studied
the
question
of
burial
mounds
that
it
was
built
in
very
early
times
and
contained
bodies
that
had
not
been
cremated
the
antiquaries
who
came
a
short
time
back
to
view
these
remains
describe
it
as
an
underground
chamber
circular
in
shape
and
an
excellent
sample
of
dry
walling
the
roof
is
and
gradually
projects
inwards
i
narrowly
escaped
taking
this
society
for
a
band
of
poachers
for
when
out
shooting
the
other
day
somebody
remarked
look
at
all
those
fellows
climbing
over
the
wall
of
the
now
the
is
a
very
sacred
institution
in
these
parts
for
it
is
a
place
of
only
four
acres
standing
isolated
in
the
midst
of
a
fine
open
country
so
that
no
human
being
is
allowed
to
enter
therein
save
to
stop
the
earth
the
night
before
hunting
we
rushed
up
in
great
haste
fully
prepared
for
mortal
combat
with
this
gang
of
ruffians
until
when
within
a
hundred
yards
the
thought
crossed
us
that
we
had
given
leave
to
the
cotswold
naturalist
society
to
make
a
tour
of
inspection
and
that
one
of
the
barrows
was
in
our
labouring
friends
of
mine
often
bring
me
relics
of
the
stone
age
which
they
have
picked
up
whilst
at
work
in
the
fields
quite
recently
a
shepherd
brought
me
a
knife
blade
and
two
flint
he
also
tells
me
they
have
lately
found
a
himmige
up
in
old
mr
tom
peregrine
possesses
a
bag
of
old
coins
of
all
dates
and
sizes
which
he
tells
you
with
great
pride
have
been
an
heirloom
in
his
family
for
generations
when
we
once
more
resume
our
pilgrimage
along
the
track
which
leads
to
chedworth
we
find
ourselves
in
a
country
which
is
never
explored
by
the
tourist
far
removed
from
railways
and
the
busy
haunts
of
men
it
is
not
even
mentioned
in
the
our
way
lies
along
the
edge
of
the
hill
for
the
next
few
miles
and
we
look
down
upon
the
picturesque
valley
of
the
coln
four
villages
all
very
like
those
we
have
described
are
passed
in
rapid
succession
winson
coln
rogers
and
fossbridge
all
lie
below
us
as
we
wend
our
way
westwards
but
although
the
architecture
is
of
the
same
massive
yet
graceful
style
and
the
old
norman
churches
still
tower
their
grand
old
heads
and
cast
their
shadows
over
the
cottages
and
farm
buildings
there
are
no
manor
houses
of
note
in
any
of
these
four
villages
and
no
demesnes
so
that
they
are
not
so
interesting
as
some
of
those
we
have
passed
through
in
all
however
there
dwell
the
good
old
honest
labouring
folk
toiling
hard
day
by
day
at
the
trivial
round
the
common
task
just
earning
enough
to
scrape
up
a
livelihood
but
enjoying
few
of
the
amenities
of
life
the
village
parsons
good
pious
men
share
in
the
quiet
uneventful
life
of
their
flock
and
who
shall
contemn
their
lot
as
horace
tells
us
vivitur
parvo
bene
cui
paternum
splendet
in
mensa
tenui
salinum
nec
leves
somnos
timor
aut
cupido
sordidus
aufert
these
four
villages
were
all
built
two
centuries
or
more
ago
when
the
cotswolds
were
the
centre
of
much
life
and
activity
and
the
days
of
agricultural
depression
were
not
known
when
we
look
down
on
their
old
grey
houses
nestling
among
the
great
trees
which
thrive
by
the
banks
of
the
fertilising
stream
we
can
not
but
speculate
on
their
future
fate
gradually
the
population
diminishes
as
work
gets
scarcer
and
scarcer
unless
there
is
an
unexpected
revival
in
prices
through
some
measure
of
protection
being
granted
by
law
or
the
medium
of
a
great
european
war
or
some
such
dispensation
of
providence
terrible
to
think
of
for
those
who
live
to
see
it
but
with
all
its
possibilities
of
good
arising
out
of
evil
for
future
generations
these
old
villages
will
contain
scarcely
a
single
inhabitant
in
a
hundred
year
time
this
part
of
the
cotswold
country
will
once
more
become
a
huge
open
plain
retaining
only
long
rows
of
stone
walls
as
evidences
of
its
former
enclosed
state
no
longer
on
sundays
will
the
notes
of
the
beautiful
bells
call
the
toilers
to
prayer
and
thanksgiving
and
all
will
be
desolation
if
only
the
capitalist
or
wealthy
man
of
business
would
take
up
his
abode
in
these
places
all
might
be
well
but
alas
the
peace
and
quiet
of
such
spots
with
all
their
fascinating
contrast
to
the
smoke
and
din
of
a
manufacturing
town
have
little
attraction
for
those
who
are
unused
to
them
and
yet
there
is
much
happiness
and
content
in
these
rural
villages
the
lot
of
those
who
are
able
to
get
work
is
a
thousand
times
more
supportable
than
that
of
the
toiling
millions
in
our
great
cities
there
is
less
drinking
and
less
vice
among
these
villagers
than
there
is
in
any
part
of
this
world
that
we
are
acquainted
with
consequently
you
find
them
cheerful
and
if
they
only
knew
it
happy
grumble
they
must
or
they
would
not
be
mortal
ah
if
they
could
but
realise
the
blessings
of
the
elixir
of
life
pure
air
and
fresh
clear
spring
water
and
sunshine
three
inestimable
privileges
that
they
enjoy
all
the
year
round
and
which
are
denied
to
so
many
of
the
inhabitants
of
this
globe
there
would
be
little
grumbling
in
the
cotswolds
from
toil
he
wins
his
spirits
light
from
busy
day
the
peaceful
night
rich
from
the
very
want
of
wealth
in
heaven
best
treasures
peace
and
health
gray
but
these
villages
are
so
and
life
is
so
monotonous
there
is
the
constant
complaint
but
what
part
of
this
earth
is
there
may
i
ask
that
is
not
dull
to
those
who
live
there
unless
we
drive
out
dull
care
and
by
that
glorious
antidote
to
gloom
and
despondency
a
fully
occupied
mind
there
are
two
chapters
in
carlyle
past
and
present
that
ought
to
be
printed
in
letters
of
gold
set
in
an
ivory
frame
and
hung
up
in
the
sleeping
apartment
of
every
man
woman
and
child
on
the
face
of
this
earth
they
are
called
labour
and
reward
in
those
few
short
pages
is
embodied
the
whole
secret
of
content
and
happiness
for
the
dwellers
in
quiet
country
villages
and
smoky
towns
alike
they
contain
the
philosopher
stone
which
makes
men
cheerful
under
all
circumstances
but
especially
those
who
are
poor
and
the
secret
is
a
very
simple
one
but
if
the
educated
classes
are
continually
losing
sight
of
it
how
much
easier
is
it
for
those
who
have
only
the
bare
necessaries
of
life
and
few
of
the
comforts
to
become
deadened
to
its
influence
it
lies
first
of
all
in
the
realisation
of
the
fact
that
the
object
of
life
is
not
to
get
still
less
to
enjoy
riches
and
pleasure
it
teaches
for
the
thousandth
time
that
the
humblest
and
the
highest
of
us
alike
are
immortal
souls
imprisoned
for
threescore
years
and
ten
in
a
tenement
of
clay
preparing
for
a
better
and
higher
existence
it
reverses
the
position
of
things
on
earth
placing
the
crown
of
kings
on
the
head
of
the
toiling
labourer
and
making
the
last
first
and
the
first
last
its
very
essence
lies
in
the
dictum
of
the
old
monks
est
work
is
worship
it
was
one
of
the
chief
characteristics
of
the
roman
people
in
the
time
of
their
greatness
that
their
most
successful
generals
were
content
to
return
to
the
plough
after
their
wars
were
over
thus
pliny
in
his
natural
history
remarks
as
follows
then
were
the
fields
cultivated
by
the
hands
of
the
generals
themselves
and
the
earth
rejoiced
tilled
as
it
was
by
a
ploughshare
crowned
with
laurels
he
who
guided
the
wheel
being
himself
fresh
from
glorious
victories
and
no
sooner
did
honest
hand
labour
become
despised
than
effeminacy
crept
in
and
this
once
haughty
nation
was
practically
blotted
out
from
the
face
of
the
earth
let
the
cotswold
labourer
realise
that
to
work
on
the
land
ploughing
and
reaping
summer
and
winter
seedtime
and
harvest
come
weal
come
woe
is
no
mean
destiny
for
an
honest
man
there
is
scope
for
the
display
of
a
noble
and
generous
spirit
in
the
beautiful
green
fields
as
well
as
in
the
smoky
atmosphere
of
the
east
end
of
london
in
a
birmingham
factory
or
a
warrington
forge
what
is
the
meaning
of
nobleness
asks
carlyle
in
a
valiant
suffering
for
others
did
nobleness
ever
lie
every
noble
crown
is
and
on
earth
will
for
ever
be
a
crown
of
thorns
all
true
work
is
sacred
in
all
true
work
were
it
but
true
hand
labour
there
is
something
of
divineness
sweat
of
the
brow
and
up
from
that
to
sweat
of
the
brain
sweat
of
the
heart
up
to
that
of
bloody
sweat
which
all
men
have
called
divine
oh
brother
if
this
is
not
worship
then
i
say
the
more
pity
for
worship
for
this
is
the
noblest
thing
yet
discovered
under
god
sky
who
art
thou
that
complainest
of
thy
life
of
toil
complain
not
look
up
my
wearied
brother
see
thy
fellow
workmen
there
in
god
eternity
surviving
those
they
alone
surviving
peopling
they
alone
the
unmeasured
solitudes
of
time
to
thee
heaven
though
severe
is
not
unkind
heaven
is
kind
as
a
noble
mother
as
that
spartan
mother
saying
while
she
gave
her
son
his
shield
it
my
son
or
upon
it
thou
too
shalt
return
home
in
honour
to
thy
far
distant

doubt
it
not
if
in
the
battle
thou
keep
thy
shield
thou
in
the
eternities
and
deepest
death
kingdoms
art
not
an
alien
thou
everywhere
art
a
denizen
complain
not
the
very
spartans
did
not
complain
would
that
the
toiling
labourer
in
the
cotswolds
and
in
our
great
smoky
cities
might
keep
these
words
continually
before
him
so
that
he
might
grasp
not
merely
the
secret
of
content
and
happiness
in
this
life
but
the
golden
key
to
the
immeasurable
blessings
of
the
sure
and
certain
hope
of
that
life
which
is
to
come
then
shall
he
hear
the
words

thou
bearest
the
prize

he
be
in

he
follow
in
the
footsteps
of

of

of

doomed
to
go
in

turns
his
necessity
to
glorious
gain
finally
the
countryman
who
feels
discontented
with
his
lot
and
there
are
few
indeed
who
do
not
occasionally
pine
for
a
change
of
employment
should
go
on
a
railway
journey
through
the
black
country
at
night
and
mark
the
fierce
light
that
reddens
the
murky
skies
as
the
factory
fires
send
forth
their
livid
flames
and
clouds
of
sooty
smoke
he
should
watch
the
swarms
of
human
beings
going
to
and
fro
and
in
and
out
like
busy
bees
around
their
hive
toiling
ever
toiling
round
about
the
blazing
fires
he
should
spend
an
hour
in
the
streets
of
birmingham
where
as
i
passed
through
one
fine
september
morning
recently
on
my
way
to
ireland
the
atmosphere
was
darkened
and
the
human
lungs
stifled
by
a
thick
yellow
fog
or
he
should
go
down
to
the
of
a
mighty
liner
when
it
is
doing
its
twenty
knots
across
the
seas
and
then
think
of
his
own
life
in
the
happy
hamlets
and
the
fresh
green
fields
of
our
english
country
coming
once
more
down
the
hill
into
the
valley
of
the
coln
we
must
cross
the
old
roman
road
known
as
the
fossway
follow
the
course
of
the
stream
and
about
a
mile
beyond
the
snug
little
village
of
fossbridge
we
reach
the
great
woods
of
chedworth
these
coverts
form
part
of
the
property
of
lord
eldon
his
house
of
stowell
stands
well
up
on
the
hill
it
is
a
grey
square
building
of
some
size
placed
so
as
to
catch
all
the
sun
and
the
breezes
too
very
much
more
healthy
and
bright
than
most
of
the
old
houses
we
have
passed
which
were
built
much
too
low
down
in
the
valley
where
the
winter
sunbeams
seldom
penetrate
and
the
river
mists
rise
damp
and
cold
at
night
as
we
walk
along
the
drive
which
leads
through
the
woods
to
the
roman
villa
any
amount
of
rabbits
and
pheasants
are
to
be
seen
and
here
take
place
annually
some
of
those
big
shoots
which
ignorant
people
are
so
fond
of
condemning
as
unsportsmanlike
simply
because
they
have
not
the
remotest
idea
what
they
are
talking
about
why
it
should
be
cruel
to
kill
a
thousand
head
in
a
day
instead
of
two
hundred
on
five
separate
days
one
fails
to
understand
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
bigger
the
shoot
the
less
cruelty
takes
place
because
bad
shots
are
not
likely
to
be
present
on
these
occasions
whilst
in
small
shoots
they
are
the
rule
rather
than
the
exception
instead
of
birds
and
ground
game
being
wounded
time
after
time
at
big
they
are
killed
stone
dead
by
some
and
acknowledged
good
shot
to
see
a
real
workman
knocking
down
rocketer
after
rocketer
at
a
height
which
would
be
considered
impossible
by
half
the
men
who
go
but
shooting
is
to
witness
an
exhibition
of
skill
and
correct
timing
which
can
only
be
attained
by
the
most
assiduous
practice
and
the
quickest
of
eyes
no
it
is
the
pottering
hedgerow
shooter
generally
on
his
neighbour
boundary
who
is
often
unsportsmanlike
we
know
one
or
two
who
would
have
no
hesitation
in
shooting
at
a
covey
of
partridges
on
the
ground
when
they
were
within
shot
of
the
boundary
hedge
and
if
they
wounded
three
or
four
and
picked
them
up
they
would
carry
them
home
fluttering
and
gasping
because
they
are
too
heartless
to
think
of
putting
the
wretched
creatures
out
of
their
sufferings
the
extensive
roman
remains
discovered
some
years
ago
in
the
heart
of
this
forest
doubtless
formed
the
country
house
of
some
roman
squire
they
are
well
away
from
the
river
bank
and
about
three
parts
of
the
way
up
the
sloping
hillside
the
house
faced
as
nearly
as
possible
in
this
point
as
in
many
others
the
romans
showed
their
superiority
of
intellect
over
our
ancestors
of
elizabethan
and
other
days
nowadays
we
begin
to
realise
that
houses
should
be
built
on
high
ground
and
that
the
aspect
that
gives
most
sun
in
winter
is
the
old
romans
realised
this
fifteen
hundred
years
ago
in
other
words
our
ancestors
in
the
dark
ages
were
infinitely
behind
the
romans
in
intellect
and
we
are
just
reaching
their
standard
of
common
sense
the
characteristics
of
the
interior
of
these
old
dwellings
are
simplicity
combined
with
refinement
and
good
taste
and
it
is
worthy
of
remark
that
the
men
who
are
ahead
of
the
thought
and
feeling
of
the
present
day
are
crying
out
for
more
simplicity
in
our
homes
and
furniture
as
well
as
for
more
refinement
and
real
architectural
merit
no
useless
luxuries
and
but
plenty
of
public
baths
and
mosaic
pavements
laboriously
put
together
by
hard
hand
labour
these
are
the
points
that
ruskin
and
the
romans
liked
in
common
with
this
grandly
timbered
valley
spread
beneath
them
no
more
suitable
spot
on
which
to
build
a
house
could
anywhere
be
found
and
though
the
romans
who
inhabited
this
villa
could
not
from
its
windows
see
the
sun
go
down
in
the
purple
west
emblematic
of
that
which
was
shortly
to
set
over
rome
they
could
see
the
glorious
dawn
of
a
new
day
boding
forth
the
dawn
that
was
already
brightening
over
england
even
as
the
old
order
changeth
yielding
place
to
new
and
they
could
see
the
splendours
of
the
moon
rising
in
the
eastern
sky
the
principal
apartment
in
this
roman
country
house
measures
about
thirty
feet
by
twenty
it
was
probably
divided
into
two
parts
forming
the
and
as
well
the
tessellated
pavements
are
wonderfully
preserved
though
not
quite
so
perfect
as
a
few
others
that
have
been
found
in
england
with
all
their
beautiful
colouring
they
are
merely
formed
of
different
shades
of
local
stone
together
with
a
little
perhaps
these
pavements
with
their
rich
mellow
tints
of
red
sandstone
and
their
shades
of
white
yellow
brown
and
grey
afforded
by
different
varieties
of
limestone
are
examples
of
the
most
perfect
kind
of
work
which
the
labours
of
mankind
combined
with
the
softening
influences
of
time
are
able
to
produce
in
one
corner
the
design
is
that
of
a
man
with
a
rabbit
in
his
hand
and
no
doubt
there
were
lots
of
rabbits
in
these
woods
in
those
days
as
well
as
deer
and
other
wild
animals

since
extinct

these

must
have
been
made

are

on
which
are
inscribed

and
greek
rho
it
was
lysons
who
first
noticed
this
evidence
of
ancient
faith
and
he
is
naturally
of
the
opinion
that
the
sacred
inscription
proves
that
the
builder
was
a
christian
another
stone
in
this
collection
has
the
word
prasiata
roughly
chiselled
on
it
there
was
a
british
king
by
name
prasutagus
said
to
have
been
a
christian
and
possibly
it
was
this
man
who
built
the
old
house
in
the
midst
of
the
chedworth
woods
a
mile
beyond
this
interesting
relic
of
roman
times
is
the
manor
house
of
cassey
compton
built
by
sir
richard
howe
about
the
middle
of
the
seventeenth
century
it
stands
on
the
banks

in
olden
times
was
approached
by
a
drawbridge
and
surrounded
by
a
moat
the
farmer
by
whom
it
is
inhabited
tells
me
that
judging
by
the
situated
close
by
he
imagines
it
was
once
a
monastery
this
was
undoubtedly
the
case
for
we
find
in
fozbrooke
that
the
archbishop
of
york
had
license
to
embattle
his
house
here
in
the
reign
of
edward
i
a
mosaic
pavement
discovered
here
about
was
placed
in

it
is
very
sad
to
come
upon
these
remote
manor
houses
in
all
parts
of
the
cotswold
district
and
to
find
that
their
ancient
glory
is
departed
even
though
their
walls
are
as
good
as
they
were
two
hundred
years
ago
when
the
old
squires
lived
their
jovial
lives
and
those

echoed

pastimes
it
is
not
surprising
that
in
those
countries
which
abound
in
sunshine
and
fresh
air
the
inhabitants
will
invariably
be
found
to
be
not
only
keen
sportsmen
but
also
accomplished
experts
in
all
the
games
and
pastimes
for
which
england
has
long
been
famous
given
good
health
and
plenty
of
work
mankind
can
not
help
being
cheerful
and
sociably
inclined
for
this
reason
we
have
christened
the
district
of
which
we
write
the
merrie
cotswolds
from
time
immemorial
the
country
people
have
delighted
in
sports
and
manly
exercises
on
the
north
wall
of
the
nave
in
cirencester
church
is
a
representation
of
the
ancient
custom
of
whitsun
ale
the
whitsuntide
sports
were
always
a
great
speciality
on
cotswold
and
continue
to
the
present
day
though
in
a
somewhat
modified
form
the
custom
portrayed
in
the
church
of
cirencester
was
as
follows
the
villagers
would
assemble
together
in
one
of
the
beautiful
old
barns
which
are
so
plentiful
in
every
hamlet
two
of
them
a
boy
and
a
girl
were
then
chosen
out
and
appointed
lord
and
lady
of
the
yule
these
are
depicted
on
the
church
wall
and
round
about
them
dressed
in
their
proper
garb
are
pages
and
jesters
and
a
numerous
company
of
dancers
the
reason
that
a
representation
of
this
very
secular
custom
is
seen
in
the
church
probably
arises
from
the
fact
that
the
church
ales
were
feasts
instituted
for
the
purpose
of
raising
money
for
the
repair
of
the
church
the
churchwardens
would
receive
presents
of
malt
from
the
farmers
and
squires
around
they
sold
the
beer
they
brewed
from
it
to
the
villagers
who
were
obliged
to
attend
or
else
pay
a
fine
the
church
house
a
building
still
to
be
seen
in
many
villages
was
usually
the
scene
of
the
festivities
the
diary
of
master
william
silence
tells
us
that
the
quiet
little
hamlets
presented
an
unusually
gay
appearance
on
these
memorable
occasions
the
village
green
was
covered
with
booths
there
were
attractions
of
various
kinds
the
churchwardens
had
taken
advantage
of
the
unusual
concourse
of
strangers
as
the
occasion
of
a
church
ale
great
barrels
of
ale
the
product
of
malt
contributed
by
the
parishioners
according
to
their
several
abilities
were
set
abroach
in
the
north
aisle
of
the
church
and
their
contents
sold
to
the
public
this
was
an
ordinary
way
of
providing
for
church
expenses
against
which
earnest
reformers
inveighed
but
as
yet
in
vain
so
far
as
shallow
was
concerned
the
church
stood
conveniently
near
the
village
green
and
the
brisk
trade
which
was
carried
on
all
day
was
not
interrupted
by
the
progress
of
divine
service
the
parson
discourse
however
appears
to
have
suffered
some
interruption
by
reason
of
the
numbers
who
crowded
into
the
aisles
to
patronise

the
ancient

still
practised

thirty
years

the
only

hereabouts
that
we

in

coursing
is
as
popular
as
ever
among
the
cotswold
farmers
these
hills
have
always
been
noted
for
the
sport
drayton
tells
us
that
the
prize
at
the
coursing
meetings
held
on
the
cotswolds
in
his
day
was
a
collar
shakespeare
in
his
wives
of
alludes
to
the
coursing
on
cotsall
there
is
an
excellent
club
at
cirencester
the
hares
in
this
district
are
remarkably
big
and
the
whole
district
lends
itself
particularly
to
this
sport
owing
to
the
large
fields
and
fine
stretches
of
open
downs
cricket
in
an
agricultural
district
such
as
the
cotswolds
it
is
inevitable
that
the
game
of
cricket
should
be
somewhat
neglected
men
who
work
day
after
day
in
the
open
air
and
to
whom
a
is
a
very
rare
experience
naturally
seek
their
recreations
in
less
energetic
fashion
than
the
noble
game
of
cricket
demands
of
its
votaries
the
class
who
derive
most
benefit
from
this
game
spring
as
a
rule
from
towns
and
manufacturing
centres
and
those
whose
work
and
interests
confine
them
indoors
the
greater
part
of
their
time
among
the
cotswold
farmers
however
a
great
deal
of
interest
is
shown
the
scores
of
county
matches
are
eagerly
pursued
in
the
daily
papers
and
if
there
is
a
big
match
on
at
cheltenham
or
any
other
neighbouring
town
a
large
number
invariably
go
to
see
it
there
is
some
difficulty
in
finding
suitable
sites
for
your
ground
in
these
parts
for
the
hill
turf
is
very
stony
and
shallow
it
is
not
always
easy
to
find
a
flat
piece
of
ground
handy
to
the
villages
a
cricket
ground
is
useless
to
the
villagers
if
it
is
perched
up
on
the
hill
half
a
mile
away
it
must
be
at
their
doors
and
even
then
though
they
may
occasionally
play
they
will
never
by
any
chance
trouble
to
roll
it
we
made
a
ground
in
the
valley
of
the
coln
some
years
ago
and
went
to
some
expense
in
the
way
of
levelling
filling
up
gravel
pits
and
removing
obstructions
like
cowsheds
but
unless
we
had
looked
after
it
ourselves
and
made
preparations
for
a
match
it
would
have
soon
gone
back
to
its
original
rough
state
again
and
yet
two
of
the
young
peregrines
in
the
village
are
wonderfully
good
cricketers
and
as
keen
as
mustard
about
it
though
when
it
comes
to
rolling
and
mowing
the
ground
they
are
not
quite
as
keen
they
will
throw
you
over
for
a
match
in
the
most
unceremonious
way
if
when
the
day
comes
they
do
feel
inclined
to
play
we
have
often
tried
to
persuade
these
two
young
fellows
to
become
professional
cricketers
there
being
such
a
poor
prospect
in
the
farming
line
but
they
have
not
the
slightest
ambition
to
play
for
the
county
though
they
are
quite
good
enough
so
they
waste
their
sweetness
on
the
desert
air
old
mr
peregrine
a
man
of
nearly
eighty
years
of
age
is
splendid
fun
when
he
is
watching
his
boys
play
cricket
he
goes
mad
with
excitement
and
if
you
take
them
off
bowling
however
much
the
batsmen
appear
to
relish
their
attack
he
wo
forgive
you
for
the
rest
of
the
day
his
eldest
son
tom
our
old
friend
the
keeper
generally
stands
umpire
he
is
not
so
useful
to
his
side
as
village
umpires
usually
are
because
he
has
got
the
moral
courage
to
give
his
side
in
when
he
knows
perfectly
well
they
are
out
the
other
day
however
he
made
a
slight
error
for
on
being
appealed
to
for
the
most
palpable
piece
of
stumping
ever
seen
in
the
cricket
field
the
ball
bouncing
back
on
to
the
wicket
from
the
pads
while
the
batsman
was
two
yards
out
of
his
ground
he
said
not
out
it
hit
the
pads
he
imagined
he
was
being
asked
whether
the
batsman
had
been
bowled
and
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
you
could
be
stumped
out
in
this
way
altogether
cotswold
cricket
is
great
fun
the
district
is
full
of
memories
of
the
prehistoric
age
and
in
certain
parts
of
the
country
cricket
is
still
indulged
in
never
shall
i
forget
going
over
to
edgeworth
with
the
winson
cricket
xi
to
play
a
match
at
that
seat
of
roman
antiquities
the
carrier
drove
us
over
in
his
brake
a
rickety
old
machine
with
a
pony
of
fourteen
hands
and
a
lanky
old
mare
over
sixteen
hands
high
in
the
shafts
together
a
most
useful
man
in
the
field
was
the
honest
carrier
whether
at
point
or
at
any
other
place
where
the
ball
comes
sharp
and
quick
for
to
quote
shakespeare
he
was
a
man
of
an
unbounded
stomach
the
rest
of
our
team
included
the
jovial
miller
two
of
the
village
carpenter
sons
excellent
folk
the
village
curate
who
captained
the
side
and
stood
six
feet
five
inches
without
his
cricket
shoes
one
or
two
farmers
a
footman
and
a
somewhat
fat
and
apoplectic
butler
the
colours
mostly
worn
by
the
winson
cricketers
are
black
red
and
gold
a
zingaric
band
inverted
black
on
top
their
motto
i
believe
to
be
tired
though
united
as
the
ground
stands
about
eight
hundred
feet
above
sea
level
all
of
us
but
especially
the
fat
butler
found
considerable
difficulty
in
getting
to
the
top
of
the
hill
after
the
brake
had
set
us
down
at
the
village
public
but
once
arrived
a
magnificent
view
was
to
be
had
extending
thirty
miles
and
more
across
the
wolds
to
the
white
horse
hill
in
berkshire
however
we
had
not
come
to
admire
the
view
so
much
as
to
play
the
game
of
cricket
we
therefore
proceeded
to
look
for
the
pitch
it
was
known
to
be
in
the
field
in
which
we
stood
because
a
large
red
flag
floated
at
one
end
and
proclaimed
that
somewhere
hereabouts
was
the
scene
of
combat
it
was
the
fat
butler
i
think
who
after
sailing
about
in
a
sea
of
waving
buttercups
like
a
veritable
christopher
columbus
first
discovered
the
stumps
among
the
mowing
grass
evident
preparations
had
been
made
either
that
morning
or
the
previous
night
for
a
grand
match
a
large
number
of
sods
of
turf
had
been
taken
up
and
hastily
replaced
on
that
portion
of
the
wicket
where
the
ball
is
supposed
to
pitch
when
it
leaves
the
bowler
hand
there
had
been
no
rain
for
a
month
but
just
where
the
stumps
were
stuck
a
bucket
or
two
of
water
had
been
dashed
hastily
on
to
the
arid
soil
while
to
crown
all
a
chain
or
rib
roller
a
ghastly
instrument
used
by
agriculturists
for
scrunching
up
the
lumps
and
bumps
on
the
ploughed
fields
and
pulverising
the
soil
had
been
used
with
such
effect
that
the
surface
of
the
pitch
to
the
depth
of
about
an
inch
had
been
reduced
to
dust
in
spite
of
this
we
all
enjoyed
ourselves
immensely
delightful
people
both
farmers
and
labourers
were
playing
against
us
quaint
i
use
the
word
in
its
true
sense
and
simple
folk
who
looked
as
if
they
had
been
dug
up
with
the
other
saxon
and
roman
antiquities
for
which
edgeworth
is
so
famous
i
was
quite
certain
that
the
man
who
bowled
me
out
was
a
direct
descendant
of
julius
caesar
he
delivered
the
ball
underhand
at
a
rapid
rate
it
came
twisting
along
now
to
the
right
now
to
the
left
seemed
to
disappear
beneath
the
surface
of
the
soil
then
suddenly
came
in
sight
again
shooting
past
the
block
eventually
they
told
me
it
removed
the
left
bail
and
struck
the
a
fearful
blow
on
the
chest
it
was
generally
agreed
that
such
a
ball
had
never
been
bowled
before
was
a
ball
as
tom
peregrine
pronounced
it
standing
umpire
in
an
enormous
wideawake
hat
and
a
white
coat
reaching
down
to
his
knees
and
smoking
a
bad
cigar
a
very
pretty
ball
said
my
fellow
batsman
at
the
other
wicket
a
d
d
pretty
ball
i
reiterated
as
i
beat
a
retreat
towards
the
flag
in
the
corner
of
the
field
which
served
as
a
pavilion
when
i
went
on
to
bowl
tom
peregrine
my
own
servant
if
you
please
was
very
nearly
me
for
said
he
i
that
business
it
looks
so
awkid
muddling
work
i
calls
it
but
i
am
anticipating
as
i
prepared
myself
for
the
fray
and
carefully
donned
a
pair
of
pads
and
an
enormously
thick
woollen
jersey
for
protection
not
so
much
against
the
cold
as
against
the
flying
ball
it
flashed
across
me
that
i
was
about
to
personify
the
immortal
dumkins
of
pickwick
fame
whilst
in
my
companion
the
stout
butler
it
was
impossible
not
to
detect
the
complacent
features
and
rounded
form
of
podder
up
to
a
certain
point
the
analogy
was
complete
let
the
winson
invincibles
equal
the
all
muggleton
while
the
edgeworth
daisy
cutters
shall
be
represented
by
dingley
dell
then
sing
us
thou
divine
author
of
pickwick
the
glories
of
that
day
all
muggleton
had
the
first
innings
and
the
interest
became
intense
when
dumkins
and
podder
two
of
the
most
renowned
members
of
that
distinguished
club
walked
bat
in
hand
to
their
respective
wickets
luffy
the
highest
ornament
of
dingley
dell
was
pitched
to
bowl
against
the
redoubtable
dumkins
and
mr
struggles
was
selected
to
do
the
same
kind
office
for
the
hitherto
unconquered
podder
the
umpires
were
stationed
behind
the
wickets
tom
peregrine
had
been
suborned
for
winson
and
proved
the
most
useful
man
on
the
side
the
scorers
were
prepared
to
notch
the
runs
a
breathless
silence
ensued
luffy
retired
a
few
paces
behind
the
wicket
of
the
passive
podder
and
applied
the
ball
to
his
right
eye
for
several
seconds
dumkins
the
author
confidently
awaited
its
coming
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
motions
of
luffy
suddenly
cried
the
bowler
the
ball
flew
from
his
hand
straight
and
swift
towards
the
centre
stump
of
the
wicket
the
wary
dumkins
was
on
the
alert
it
fell
upon
the
tip
of
his
bat
here
with
deep
sorrow
let
it
be
stated
that
the
writer
failed
to
evince
the
admirable
skill
displayed
by
his
worthy
prototype
the
dumkins
of
grim
reality
was
unable
to
compete
with
the
dumkins
of
fiction
instead
of
sending
the
ball
far
away
over
the
heads
of
the
scouts
who
just
stooped
low
enough
to
let
it
fly
over
them
i
caught
it
just
as
it
pitched
on
a
and
sent
it
straight
up
into
the
air
like
a
soaring
rocket
right
right
i
have
it
yelled
bowler
and
simultaneously
run
two
podder
they
never
catch
it
shouted
dumkins
with
all
his
might
catch
it
in
your
bill
screamed
the
edgeworth
eleven
never
was
such
confusion
i
was
already
starting
for
the
second
run
whilst
my
stout
fellow
batsman
was
halfway
through
the
first
when
the
ball
came
down
like
a
meteor
and
narrowly
shaving
the
luckless
podder
head
hit
the
ground
with
a
loud
thud
about
five
yards
distant
from
the
outstretched
hands
of
the
anxious
bowler
who
collided
with
his
ally
the
in
the
middle
of
the
pitch
half
stunned
by
the
shock
and
disappointed
at
his
want
of
success
in
his
attempt
to
judge
the
catch
the
bowler
had
yet
presence
of
mind
enough
to
seize
the
ball
and
hurl
it
madly
at
the
stumps
but
the
being
still
de
it
flew
away
towards
the
spectators
and
buried
itself
among
the
mowing
grass
come
six
podder
i
shouted
amid
cries
of
keep
on
running
run
it
out
from
spectators
and
scouts
alike
and
run
we
did
for
the
umpire
forgot
to
call
lost
ball
and
we
should
have
been
running
still
but
for
the
ingenuity
of
one
of
our
opponents
for
whilst
all
were
busily
engaged
in
searching
among
the
grass
a
yokel
stole
up
unawares
with
an
innocent
expression
on
his
face
raced
poor
podder
down
the
pitch
produced
the
ball
from
his
trouser
pocket
and
knocked
off
the
bails
in
the
nick
of
time
out
says
peregrine
amid
a
roar
of
laughter
from
the
whole
field
and
podder
had
to
go
now
came
the
question
how
many
runs
should
be
scored
for
i
had
passed
my
fellow
batsman
in
the
race
having
completed
seven
runs
to
his
five
eventually
it
was
decided
to
split
the
difference
and
call
it
a
sixer
the
suggestion
of
a
member
of
our
side
that
seven
should
be
scored
to
me
and
five
to
podder
making
twelve
in
all
being
rejected
after
careful
consideration
thus
from
the
first
ball
bowled
in
this
historic
match
there
arose
the
whole
of
the
remarkable
events
recorded
above
therein
is
shown
the
complete
performances
with
the
bat
of
two
renowned
cricketers
for
alas
i
in
once
more
trying
to
play
up
to
the
form
of
dumkins
i
was
bowled
slick
the
very
next
ball
as
hath
been
said
or
sung
there
was
much
chaff
flying
about
during
the
match
but
no
fighting
and
squabbling
save
when
a
boundary
hit
was
made
when
the
batsman
always
shouted
three
runs
and
the
bowler
no
only
one
the
scores
were
not
high
but
i
remember
that
we
won
by
three
runs
that
the
carpenter
son
got
a
black
eye
that
we
had
tea
in
an
old
manor
house
turned
into
an
inn
and
drove
home
in
the
glow
of
a
glorious
sunset
not
entirely
displeased
with
our
first
experience
of
prehistoric
cricket
some
of
the
pleasantest
matches
we
have
ever
taken
part
in
have
been
those
at
owing
to
the
very
soft
wicket
which
he
found
on
arriving
this
place
was
once
christened
by
a
cricketer
indeed
it
is
often
a
case
of
but
in
spite
of
a
soft
pitch
there
is
great
keenness
and
plenty
of
rivalry
about
these
matches
bourton
is
a
truly
delightful
village
the
windrush
like
the
coln
at
bibury
runs
for
some
distance
alongside
of
the
village
street
the
or
premier
club
as
the
sporting
press
delight
to
call
the
famous
institution
at
lord
generally
get
thoroughly
well
beaten
by
the
local
club
for
so
small
a
place
they
certainly
put
a
wonderfully
strong
team
into
the
field
on
their
own
native
bog
they
are
fairly
invincible
though
we
fancy
on
the
clay
at
lord
their
bowlers
would
lose
a
little
of
their
cunning
in
the
luncheon
tent
at
bourton
there
are
usually
more
wasps
than
are
ever
seen
gathered
together
in
one
place
they
come
in
thousands
from
their
nests
in
the
banks
of
the
windrush
if
you
are
playing
a
match
there
it
is
advisable
to
tuck
your
trousers
into
your
socks
when
you
sit
down
to
luncheon
this
together
with
the
fact
that
the
tent
has
been
known
to
blow
down
in
the
middle
of
luncheon
makes
these
matches
very
lively
and
amusing
what
more
lively
scene
could
be
imagined
than
a
large
tent
with
cricketers
and
a
few
hundred
wasps
hard
at
work
eating
and
drinking
then
on
the
tent
suddenly
collapsing
the
said
cricketers
and
the
said
wasps
mixed
up
with
chairs
tables
ham
beef
and
apple
tart
and
the
various
ingredients
of
a
cricket
lunch
all
struggling
on
the
floor
and
striving
in
vain
to
find
their
way
out
as
best
they
can
fortunately
on
the
only
occasion
that
the
tent
blew
down
when
we
were
present
it
was
not
a
good
wasp
year
besides
the
matches
at
bourton
there
is
plenty
of
cricket
at
cirencester
northleach
and
other
centres
in
the
cotswolds
the
hunt
matches
are
great
institutions
even
though
hunting
people
as
a
rule
do
not
care
for
cricket
and
invariably
drop
a
catch
a
good
sportsman
and
excellent
fellow
has
lately
presented
a
cup
to
be
competed
for
by
the
village
clubs
of
this
district
this
no
doubt
will
give
a
great
impetus
to
the
game
amongst
all
classes
our
village
club
has
already
been
revived
in
order
to
compete
our
only
fear
with
regard
to
the
cup
competition
is
that
when
you
get
two
elevens
on
to
a
ground
and
two
umpires
none
of
whom
know
the
rules
for
cricket
laws
are
the
most
misunderstandable
things
in
creation
the
final
tie
will
degenerate
into
a
free
fight
be
this
as
it
may
anything
that
can
make
the
greatest
pastime
of
this
country
popular
in
the
merrie
cotswolds
is
a
step
in
the
right
direction
it
is
pleasing
to
watch
boys
and
men
hard
at
work
practising
on
summer
evenings
the
rougher
the
ground
the
more
they
like
it
scorning
pads
and
gloves
they
go
in
to
bat
and
make
herculean
efforts
to
hit
the
ball
and
this
with
fast
bowling
and
the
bumpy
nature
of
the
pitch
is
a
very
difficult
thing
to
do
they
play
on
long
after
sunset
the
darker
it
gets
and
the
more
dangerous
to
life
and
limb
the
game
becomes
the
happier
they
are
we
are
bound
to
admit
that
when
we
play
with
them
a
good
pitch
is
generally
prepared
it
would
be
bad
policy
to
endeavour
to
compete
in
the
game
they
play
as
we
should
merely
expose
ourselves
to
ridicule
and
one
reputation
as
the
man
who
has
been
known
to
play
in
the
papers
as
they
are
accustomed
to
call
big
county
matches
would
very
soon
be
entirely
lost
i
was
much
amused
a
few
years
ago
on
arriving
home
after
playing
for
somersetshire
in
some
cricket
matches
when
tom
peregrine
made
up
to
me
with
a
face
like
a
benediction
and
asked
if
i
was
the
gentleman
who
had
been
playing
in
the
papers
while
on
the
subject
of
cricket
for
some
time
past
we
have
made
experiments
of
all
sorts
of
cricket
grounds
and
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
following
is
the
best
recipe
to
prepare
a
pitch
on
a
dry
and
bumpy
ground
a
week
before
your
match
get
a
wheelbarrow
full
of
clay
and
put
it
into
a
or
any
receptacle
for
holding
water
having
mixed
your
clay
with
water
keep
pouring
the
mixture
on
to
your
pitch
taking
care
that
the
stones
and
gravel
which
sink
to
the
bottom
do
not
fall
out
when
you
have
emptied
your
get
some
more
clay
and
water
and
continue
pouring
it
on
to
the
ground
until
you
have
covered
a
patch
about
yards
long
and
three
yards
wide
always
remembering
not
to
empty
out
the
sediment
at
the
bottom
of
the
for
this
will
spoil
all
then
setting
to
work
with
your
roller
roll
the
clay
and
water
into
the
ground
never
mind
if
it
picks
up
on
to
the
roller
a
little
more
water
will
soon
put
that
to
rights
after
an
hour
rolling
you
will
have
a
level
and
true
cricket
pitch
requiring
but
two
or
three
days
sun
to
make
it
hard
and
true
as
asphalt
you
may
think
you
have
killed
the
grass
but
if
you
water
your
pitch
in
the
absence
of
rain
the
day
after
you
have
played
on
it
the
grass
will
not
die
it
is
chiefly
in
australia
that
cricket
grounds
are
treated
in
this
way
they
are
dressed
with
mud
off
the
harbours
and
rolled
simultaneously
such
grounds
are
wonderfully
true
and
durable
if
the
pitch
is
naturally
a
clay
one
it
might
be
sufficient
to
use
water
only
and
roll
at
the
same
time
but
for
renovating
a
worn
clay
pitch
a
little
strong
loamy
soil
washed
in
with
water
and
rolled
down
will
fill
up
all
the
chinks
and
holes
it
will
make
an
old
pitch
as
good
as
new
the
reason
that
nine
out
of
ten
village
grounds
are
bad
and
bumpy
is
that
they
are
not
rolled
soon
enough
after
rain
or
after
being
watered
roll
and
water
them
simultaneously
and
they
will
be
much
improved
another
excellent
plan
is
to
soak
the
ground
with
clay
and
water
and
leave
it
alone
for
a
week
or
ten
days
before
rolling
permanent
benefit
will
be
done
to
the
soil
by
this
method
for
golf
greens
and
courts
situated
on
light
soil
loam
is
an
indispensable
dressing
any
loamy
substance
will
vastly
improve
the
texture
of
a
light
soil
and
the
quality
of
the
herbage
yet
it
is
most
difficult
to
convince
people
of
this
fact
we
have
known
cases
in
which
hundreds
of
pounds
have
been
expended
on
cricket
grounds
and
golf
greens
when
an
application
of
clay
would
have
put
the
whole
thing
to
rights
at
the
cost
of
a
few
shillings
one
committee
had
artificial
wells
made
on
every
putting
green
of
their
golf
course
in
order
to
have
water
handy
for
keeping
the
turf
cool
and
green
what
better
receptacle
for
water
could
they
have
found
than
a
of
half
an
inch
of
loam
or
clay
retaining
as
it
does
every
drop
of
moisture
that
falls
in
the
shape
of
dew
or
rain
instead
of
allowing
it
to
percolate
through
like
a
sieve
as
is
the
case
with
an
ordinary
sandy
soil
yet
this
clay
dressing
while
retaining
water
becomes
hard
firm
and
as
level
as
a
billiard
table
on
the
timely
application
of
the
roller
those
who
look
after
cricket
grounds
and
the
like
have
seldom
any
acquaintance
with
the
constitution
of
soils
they
are
apt
to
treat
all
whether
sand
light
loam
strong
loam
heavy
clay
or
even
peat
in
exactly
the
same
way
instead
of
recollecting
that
as
in
agriculture
a
judicious
combination
will
alone
give
us
that
which
produces
the
best
turf
and
the
best
soil
for
every
purpose
i
am
quite
convinced
that
our
farmers
do
not
realise
how
much
worthless
light
land
may
be
improved
by
a
dressing
of
clay
or
loam
such
dressings
are
expensive
without
a
doubt
but
the
amelioration
of
the
soil
is
so
marked
that
in
favourable
localities
the
process
ought
to
pay
in
the
long
run
turning
to
cricket
in
general
perhaps
the
modern
game
as
played
on
a
good
wicket
is
in
every
respect
save
one
perfection
if
only
something
could
be
done
to
curtail
the
length
of
matches
and
rid
us
of
that
awful
nuisance
the
poking
batsman
there
would
be
little
improvement
possible
all
the
world
a
stage
and
even
at
cricket
the
analogy
holds
good
thus
shakespeare
as
in
a
theatre
the
eyes
of
men
after
a
actor
leaves
the
stage
are
idly
bent
on
him
that
enters
next
thinking
his
prattle
to
be
tedious
so
also
one
may
say
of
some
dull
and
lifeless
cricketer
who
after
the
famous
gloucestershire
hitter
has
made
things
merry
for
spectators
and
scouts
alike
enters
next
as
in
a
cricket
field
the
eyes
of
men
after
a
player
leaves
the
are
idly
bent
on
him
that
enters
next
thinking
his
to
be
tedious
on
the
other
hand
if
we
sow
the
wild
oats
of
cricket
in
other
words
if
we
risk
everything
for
the
fleeting
satisfaction
of
a
blind
slog
we
shall
be
bowled
stumped
or
caught
out
for
a
moral
certainty
it
is
only
a
matter
of
time
perhaps
the
addition
of
another
stump
might
help
towards
the
very
desirable
end
of
shortening
the
length
of
matches
and
thus
enable
more
amateurs
to
take
part
in
them
i
can
not
agree
with
those
who
lament
the
improved
state
of
our
best
english
cricket
grounds
if
only
the
batsmen
play
a
free
game
and
do
not
waste
time
the
game
is
far
more
entertaining
for
players
and
spectators
alike
when
a
true
wicket
is
provided
the
heroes
of
old
when
bird
and
beldham
budd
and
such
as
they
lord
frederick
too
once
england
chief
and
flower
astonished
all
who
came
to
see
them
play
those
scorners
of
the
ground
and
of
pads
and
gloves
doubtless
displayed
more
on
their
rough
bumpy
grounds
than
is
now
called
forth
in
facing
the
attack
of
kortright
mold
or
richardson
but
on
the
other
hand
on
rough
grounds
much
is
left
to
chance
and
cricket
as
played
on
a
wicket
certainly
favours
the
batsman
but
it
admits
of
a
brilliancy
and
finish
in
the
matter
of
style
that
are
impossible
on
the
wicket
whilst
the
modern
bowler
has
learnt
extraordinary
accuracy
of
pitch
the
batsman
has
perfected
the
art
of
timing
the
ball
and
what
a
subtle
delicate
art
is
correct
timing
the
skilful
embodiment
of
thought
in
action
depending
for
success
on
that
absolute
sympathy
of
hand
and
eye
which
only
assiduous
practice
confidence
and
a
good
digestion
can
give
and
on
uncertain
treacherous
ground
confident
play
is
never
seen
a
ball
can
not
be
cut
or
driven
with
any
real
brilliancy
of
style
when
there
is
a
likelihood
of
its
abruptly
shooting
or
bumping
no
if
we
would
leave
as
little
as
possible
to
chance
our
grounds
can
not
be
too
good
even
from
a
purely
selfish
point
of
view
apart
from
the
welfare
of
our
side
the
pleasure
derived
from
a
good
innings
on
a
cricket
ground
is
as
great
as
that
bestowed
by
any
other
physical
amusement
perhaps
one
ought
not
to
think
of
comparing
the
sport
of
with
its
extraordinary
variety
of
incident
and
surroundings
the
study
of
a
lifetime
to
the
game
of
cricket
at
the
same
time
for
actual
enjoyment
and
for
economy
the
game
holds
its
own
against
all
amusements
has
said
that
given
a
country
and
a
fox
a
burning
scent
the
man
on
a
horse
with
a
good
for
twenty
or
thirty
minutes
absorbs
as
much
happiness
into
his
mental
and
physical
organisation
as
human
nature
is
capable
of
containing
at
one
time
this
is
very
true
but
how
seldom
the
five
necessary
conditions
are
forthcoming
simultaneously
the
keen
hunting
man
has
learnt
from
bitter
experience
you
will
be
lucky
if
the
real
good
thing
comes
off
once
for
every
ten
days
you
hunt
in
cricket
a
man
is
dependent
on
his
own
quickness
of

and
eye
in
hunting

is
that
vital
contingency

no

pursuit
are
energy
and
perseverance
so
absolutely
sure
of
bearing
fruit
if
we
only
stick
to
it
long
enough
the
fact
is
that
cricket
like
many
other
things
is
but
the
image
and
prototype
of
life
in
general
and
the
same
qualities
that
earnestly
cultivated
in
spite
of
repeated
failure
and
disappointment
make
good
cricketers
lead
ultimately
to
success
in
all
the
walks
of
life
in
spite
of
the
improvement
in
grounds
cricket
is
still
an
excellent
school
for
teaching
physical
courage
many
grounds
are
somewhat
rough
and
bumpy
to
field
on
beautifully
smooth
though
they
look
from
the
pavilion
we
have
only
to
stand
or
point
on
a
cold
day
at
the
beginning
of
may
whilst
a
batsman
well
set
on
a
true
wicket
is
driving
or
cutting
ball
after
ball
against
our
hands
and
shins
to
realise
what
a
capital
school
for
courage
the
game
is
how
exacting
is
the
critic
in
this
matter
of
fielding
and
how
delightfully
simple
the
bowling
looks
from
that
admirably
safe
the
pavilion
just
as
to
a
man
comfortably
stationed
in
the
at
aintree
nothing
looks
easier
than
the
way
in
which
the
best
horses
in
the
world
flit
over
the
fences
leaving
them
behind
with
scarcely
an
effort
their
riders
sitting
quietly
in
the
saddle
all
the
while
so
does
the
pavilion
critic
pride
himself
on
the
way
he
would
have
cut
that
short
one
instead
of
merely
stopping
it
or
blocked
that
simple
ball
that
went
straight
on
and
bowled
the
wicket
everything
that
is
well
and
gracefully
performed
appears
easy
to
the
but
that
ease
and
grace
whether
in
the
racehorse
or
in
the
man
has
only
been
acquired
by
months
and
years
of
training
and
practice
it
is
seldom
that
the
spectator
is
able
to
form
a
true
and
unbiassed
opinion
as
to
the
varied
contingencies
which
lead
to
victory
or
defeat
in
cricket
the
actual
players
and
the
umpires
are
perhaps
alone
qualified
to
judge
to
what
extent
the
fluctuations
of
the
game
are
affected
by
the
vagaries
of
weather
and
ground
for
this
reason
it
is
well
to
take
newspaper
criticism
grano
what
is
the
cause
of
the
extraordinary
fluctuations
of
form
which
all
cricketers
from
the
greatest
to
the
least
are
more
or
less
subject
to
it
can
not
be
set
down
altogether
to
luck
for
a
run
of
bad
luck
such
as
all
men
have
at
times
experienced
is
often
compatible
with
being
in
the
very
best
form
a
man
who
is
playing
very
well
at
the
net
often
gets
out
directly
he
goes
in
to
bat
in
a
match
whilst
many
a
good
player
who
tells
you
he
has
not
had
a
bat
in
his
hand
this
season
in
his
very
first
innings
for
the
year
makes
a
big
score
in
subsequent
innings
oddly
enough
he
feels
the
want
of
net
practice
would
seem
to
be
the
quâ
for
the
successful
batsman
nothing
succeeds
like
success
and
once
fairly
started
on
a
sequence
of
big
scores
the
cricketer
goes
on
day
by
day
piling
up
runs
and
acquirit
perhaps
being
in
form
does
not
depend
so
much
on
the
state
of
the
digestion
as
on
the
state
of
the
anxiety
or
excitement
fostered
by
usually
results
in
a
blank
some
men
like
horses
are
totally
unable
to
do
themselves
credit
on
great
occasions
they
go
off
their
feed
and
are
utterly
out
of
sorts
in
consequence
on
the
other
hand
sheer
force
of
will
has
often
enabled
men
to
make
a
big
score
many
a
good
batsman
can
recall
occasions
on
which
he
made
a
mental
resolve
on
the
morning
of
a
match
to
make
a
century
and
did
it
how
curious
it
is
that
really
good
players
from
staleness
or
some
unknown
cause
occasionally
become
absolutely
useless
for
a
time
every
fresh
failure
seems
to
bring
more
and
more
nervousness
until
from
sheer
lack
of
confidence
their
case
becomes
hopeless
and
a
child
could
bowl
them
out
ah
well
we
must
not
grumble
at
the
ups
and
downs
of
the
finest
game
in
creation
every
dog
will
have
his
day
sooner
or
later
of
that
we
may
be
sure
and
not
the
least
of
the
advantages
of
cricket
is
the
large
number
of
friends
made
on
the
tented
field
for
this
reason
the
jolliest
cricket
is
undoubtedly
that
which
is
played
by
the
various
wandering
clubs
whether
you
are
fighting
under
the
banner
of
the
brotherhood
whose
motto
is
united
though
untied
or
under
the
flag
of
the
red
black
and
gold
or
with
any
other
of
the
many
excellent
clubs
that
abound
nowadays
you
will
have
an
enjoyable
game
whether
you
make
fifty
runs
or
a

the
cotswolds
three
hundred
years
ago
nowadays
thanks
in
a
great
measure
to
madden
book
the
diary
of
master
william
silence
it
is
beginning
to
dawn
on
us
that
the
cotswolds
are
more
or
less
connected
with
the
great
poet
of
blunt
in
his
cotswold
dialect
gives
no
less
than
passages
from
the
works
of
shakespeare
in
which
words
and
phrases
peculiar
to
the
district
are
made
use
of
up
to
the
reign
of
queen
anne
this
vast
open
tract
of
downland
formed
a
happy
hunting
ground
for
the
inhabitants
of
all
the
surrounding
counties
warwickshire
oxfordshire
and
wiltshire
as
well
as
gloucestershire
folk
repaired
to
the
wolds
for
hunting
coursing
hawking
and
other
amusements
and
in
olden
times
even
more
than
cotswold
was
as
burton
described
it
a
type
of
what
is
most
commodious
for
hawking
hunting
wood
waters
and
all
manner
of
pleasures
there
never
was
a
district
so
well
adapted
for
nowadays
the
cotswold
district
falls
short
in
one
desideratum
and
that
a
most
essential
one
of
being
a
hunting
country
the
large
extent
of
ploughed
land
and
the
extreme
dryness
and
poverty
of
the
soil
cause
it
on
four
days
out
of
five
to
carry
a
most
indifferent
scent
but
we
pursue
the
fox
in
shakespeare
time
the
stag
was
the
quarry
and
as
hunting
men
are
well
aware
the
scent
given
off
by
a
stag
is
not
only
ravishing
to
hounds
but
it
actually
increases
as
the
quarry
tires
whilst
that
from
a
fox
grows
small
by
degrees
and
beautifully
less
as
with
hunting
so
also
with
coursing
and
hawking
the
cotswolds
were
the
grand
centre
of
elizabethan
sport
here
it
was
that
shakespeare
marked
the
falcon
waiting
on
and
towering
in
her
pride
of
place
here
he
saw
the
fallow
greyhounds
competing
for
the
collar
what
an
interest
and
a
dignity
does
a
district
such
as
this
draw
from
even
the
slenderest
association
with
the
splendid
name
of
william
shakespeare
for
my
part
i
freely
confess
that
scenery
however
grand
and
sublime
appeals
but
little
to
the
imagination
unless
it
be
hallowed
by
association
or
blended
in
the
thoughts
with
the
recollection
of
those
we
have
either
loved
or
admired
thus
in
india
in
natal
and
cape
colony
in
glorious
ceylon
i
could
admire
those
wonderful
purple
mountains
and
that
tropical
luxuriance
of
fertility
and
verdure
but
i
could
not
them
the
boundless
wolds
of
africa
reminding
one
so
much
of
gloucestershire
yet
far
grander
and
far
finer
than
anything
of
the
kind
in
england
were
to
me
a
dreary
wilderness
passing
through
the
fine
broken
hill
country
of
natal
was
like
visiting
chaos
a
waste
inhospitable
land
where
no
one
comes
or
hath
come
since
the
making
of
the
world
how
well
i
remember
the
first
sight
of
the
wolds
of
south
africa
it
was
the
hour
of
uncertain
light
that
comes
before
the
dawn
and
as
our
railway
train
wound
its
tortuous
course
like
a
snake
up
the
awful
heights
that
would
ultimately
end
in
majuba
hill
to
which
spot
i
was
bound
the
billowy
waves
of
rolling
down
seemed
gradually
to
change
to
an
immensely
rough
ocean
running
mountains
high
and
the
mimosa
trees
dotting
the
plain
for
hundreds
of
miles
appeared
like
armies
of
the
souls
of
all
the
black
men
that
ever
lived
on
earth
since
the
world
began
there
were
passes
and
chasms
like
the
portals
of
inaccessible
paradise
with
dreadful
faces
thronged
and
fiery
arms
and
then
the
scene
changed
the
hills
rose
like
graves
of
white
men
and
barrows
to
the
dead
great
oblong
barrows
round
celtic
barrows
and
stately
sarcophagi
monumental
effigies
in
alabaster
granite
and
porphyry
grim
gothic
castles
dating
back
to
the
foundation
of
the
world
and
grim
gothic
cathedrals
with
aisles
where
the
great
organ
of
eternity
kept
thundering
ceaselessly
for
the
lightning
and
the
thunder
are
powers
to
be
reckoned
with
in
those
awful
realms
of
chaos
and
then
the
scene
changed
again
there
suddenly
uprose
weird
shapes
of
giants
and
leviathans
huge
mammoths
and
whole
regiments
of
fantastic
monsters
that
looked
like
clouds
and
yet
were
mountains
and
there
were
fortresses
and
towers
of
silence
with
vultures
hovering
over
them
and
cliffs
and
crags
and
jutting
promontories
that
looked
like
mountains
but
were
really
clouds
for
the
black
clouds
and
the
frowning
hills
were
so
much
alike
that
save
when
the
lightning
shone
you
could
not
say
where
the
sky
ended
and
the
land
began
but
there
was
one
gleam
of
hope
in
this
weird
and
dismal
scene
for
on
the
farthest
verge
of
the
horizon
there
appeared
as
it
were
a
lake
such
a
lake
as
saw
the
passing
of
arthur
vanishing
in
mystery
and
silently
floating
away
upon
a
barge
towards
the
east
it
was
a
lake
of
beryl
whose
golden
shores
were
set
with
rubies
and
sardonyx
and
beyond
these
again
were
the
more
distant
waters
of
the
silver
sea
and
as
when
sir
bedivere
saw
straining
his
eyes
beneath
an
arch
of
hand
or
thought
he
saw
the
speck
that
bare
the
king
down
that
long
water
opening
on
the
deep
somewhere
far
off
pass
on
and
on
and
go
from
less
to
less
and
vanish
into
light
and
the
new
sun
rose
bringing
the
new
year
so
over
the
plains
of
africa
rose
the
mighty
alchemist
and
great
revealer
of
truth
the
scatterer
of
dreary
darkness
and
secret
night
turning
those
shadowy
hills
to
purple
and
those
mystic
waters
in
the
eastern
sky
to
gold
how
different
are
our
feelings
when
we
traverse
either
in
reality
or
in
fancy
such
parts
of
the
earth
as
are
deeply
blended
in
our
hearts
and
minds
with
old
familiar
associations
whilst
wandering
through
the
lake
district
of
england
how
are
we
reminded
of
wordsworth
and
the
excursion
how
can
we
visit
devonshire
and
the
west
country
without
summoning
up
pleasant
thoughts
of
charles
kingsley
and
amyas
leigh
of
the
men
of
bideford
sir
richard
grenville
and
the
little
revenge
how
vividly
do
the
trossachs
recall
the
lady
of
the
lake
and
walter
scott
how
with
edinburgh
do
we
connect
the
sad
story
of
mary
the
queen
at
killarney
or
standing
amid
the
gothic
tracery
of
tintern
how
do
we
think
on
alfred
tennyson
and
the
days
that
are
no
more
these
are
only
a
few
of
the
places
in
the
british
isles
that
by
universal
consent
are
hallowed
by
tender
associations
of
those
spots
in
england
which
are
dear
to
our
hearts
for
personal
reasons
there
are
of
course
hundreds
every
man
has
his
own
peculiar
prejudices
in
this
respect
to
some
london
is
the
most
sacred
spot
on
earth
and
who
shall
deny
that
with
all
her
faults
london
is
not
a
vastly
interesting
place
is
not
every
street
hallowed
by
its
associations
with
some
great
name
or
some
great
event
in
english
history
which
of
us
can
stand
amid
the
gothic
tracery
and
the
crumbling
cloisters
of
westminster
or
under
the
shadow
of
the
old
grey
towers
of
whitehall
without
recalling
scenes
and
paths
of
glory
that
lead
but
to
the
grave
who
can
stand
unmoved
on
any
of
the
famous
bridges
that
span

silent
river

the

the
most
interesting
place
on
the
face
of
the
earth
and
perhaps
he
was
right
let
us
hear
what
he
has
to
say
about
this
halo
of
old
association
to
abstract
the
mind
from
all
local
emotion
would
be
impossible
if
it
were
endeavoured
and
would
be
foolish
if
it
were
possible
whatever
withdraws
us
from
the
power
of
our
senses
whatever
makes
the
past
the
distant
or
the
future
predominate
over
the
present
advances
us
in
the
dignity
of
thinking
beings
far
from
me
and
from
my
friends
be
such
frigid
philosophy
as
may
conduct
us
indifferent
and
unmoved
over
any
ground
which
has
been
dignified
by
wisdom
bravery
or
virtue
this
then
is
the
difference
between
the
plains
of
africa
and
the
hills
and
valleys
of
england
the
one
is
at
present
a
vast
inhospitable
chaos
the
other
a
land
in
which
there
is
scarcely
an
acre
that
has
not
been
dignified
by
wisdom
bravery
or
virtue
such
are
the
signs
by
which
we
are
to
distinguish
cosmos
from
chaos
how
far
into
the
cotswold
hills
the
halo
of
glory
may
be
said
to
extend
it
is
not
easy
to
determine
let
us
allow
at
all
events
that
the
from
the
arc
reaches
across
the
whole
extent
of
the
wolds
as
far
as
dursley
for
here
on
the
western
edge
of
the
cotswolds
it
is
probable
that
shakespeare
spent
that
portion
of
his
life
which
has
always
been
involved
in
obscurity
the
interval
between
his
removal
from
warwickshire
and
his
arrival
in
london
on
a
fine
autumnal
evening
in
the
year
a
horseman
mounted
on
a
little
ambling
nag
neared
the
cotswold
village
of
bibury
both
man
and
steed
showed
unmistakable
signs
of
weariness
the
horse
especially
though
of
that
wiry
kind
known
as
the
irish
hobby
hard
as
iron
and
accustomed
to
long
journeys
evinced
by
that
sober
and
even
dejected
expression
of
countenance
so
well
known
to
hunting
men
that
he
had
been
ridden
both
far
and
fast
the
saddle
too
as
well
as
the
legs
chest
and
flanks
of
the
nag
appeared
wet
and
as
if
some
brook
had
been
swum
or
some
deep
and
muddy
river
forded
whilst
the
left
shoulder
and
knee
of
the
rider
bore
marks
which
told
tales
of
a
fall
the
personal
appearance
of
the
man
was
not
such
as
to
excite
the
interest
of
the
casual
for
his
dress
though
extremly
neat
was
that
worn
by
clerks
and
other
townsfolk
of
the
day
yet
a
keen
observer
might
have
noticed
that
the
features
were
those
of
a
man
of
uncommon
character
in
whom
as
carlyle
would
have
said
a
germ
of
irrepressible
force
had
been
implanted
it
had
indeed
been
a
glorious
day
the
hounds
after
meeting
close
to
in
warwickshire
had
found
a
great
hart
in
the
forest
near
seizincote
and
had
hunted
him
at
force
over
the
deep
undrained
vale
up
on
to
the
cotswold
hills
away
past
and
towards
the
great
woods
of
chedworth
but
the
stag
after
crossing
the
windrush
close
to
dutton
house
at
sherborne
had
failed
to
make
his
point
and
had
taken
soil
in
a
deep
pool
of
the
river
coln
near
the
little
village
of
where
eventually
the
mort
had
sounded
such
a
run
had
not
been
seen
for
many
a
long
day
for
it
measured
no
less
than
fourteen
miles
as
the
crow
flies
and
about
as
the
hounds
ran
the
time
occupied
had
been
close
on
seven
hours
there
had
of
course
been
several
checks
but
so
strong
had
been
the
scent
of
this
hart
that
in
spite
of
two
lets
of
some
twenty
minutes
duration
the
pack
had
been
able
to
hunt
their
quarry
to
the
bitter
end
only
two
men
had
seen
the
end
the
pride
and
chivalry
of
warwickshire
mounted
on
their
flanders
mares
their
galway
nags
and
their
splendid
barbaries
had
been
hopelessly
thrown
out
of
the
chase
and
besides
the
huntsman
on
his
little
english
horse
the
only
remnant
of
the
field
was
our
friend
with
his
tough
and
wiry
irish
hobby
it
is
five
and
the
sun
as
it
disappears
beyond
a
high
ridge
of
the
wolds
is
tinging
the
grey
walls
of
an
ancient
gothic
fane
with
a
rosy
glow
this
our
sportsman
does
not
fail
to
notice
but
in
spite
of
his
keen
appreciation
of
the
beauties
of
nature
the
question
uppermost
in
his
mind
as
he
jogs
along
the
rough
uneven
road
or
track
which
leads
to
bibury
is
where
to
spend
the
night
the
thought
of
returning
home
at
that
late
hour
does
not
enter
his
head
for
the
stag
having
gone
away
in
exactly
the
opposite
direction
to
that
from
which
the
warwickshire
man
had
set
out
early
in
the
morning
there
are
no
less
than
long
and
weary
miles
between
the
hunter
and
his
home
in
the
days
of
good
queen
bess
however
hospitality
was
proverbially
free
and
any
decently
set
up
englishman
was
tolerably
sure
of
a
welcome
at
any
of
the
country
houses
which
were
then
as
now
scattered
at
long
intervals
over
this
wild
uncultivated
district
and
as
he
rides
round
a
bend
in
the
valley
a
fair
manor
house
comes
into
view
pleasantly
placed
in
a
sheltered
spot
hard
by
the
river
coln
it
was
built
in
the
style
which
had
just
come
into
vogue
the
elizabethan
form
of
architecture
and
in
honour
of
the
reigning
monarch
its
front
presented
the
appearance
of
the
letter
the
windows
instead
of
being
made
of
horn
were
of
glass
and
tall
stone
chimneys
a
modern
luxury
but
lately
invented
carried
away
the
smoke
from
the
chambers
within
it
so
happened
that
at
the
moment
the
stranger
was
passing
the
owner
of
the
house
a
squire
of
some
sixty
years
of
age
but
hale
and
hearty
was
standing
in
front
of
his
porch
taking
the
evening
air
this
fact
the
horseman
did
not
fail
to
notice
and
with
a
ready
eye
to
the
main
chance
which
showed
its
possessor
to
be
a
man
of
no
ordinary
apprehension
he
glanced
approvingly
at
the
groined
porch
the
richly
carved
pinnacles
above
it
and
at
the
quaint
belfry
beyond
exclaiming
with
great
enthusiasm

ushered
the

long
low

hung
with
pikes
and
guns
and
bows
and
relics
of
the
chase
as

the

was
strewed
with
clean
rushes
and
lying
about
on
tables
were
trashes
collars
and
whips
for
hounds

the

downfall
was
at

call
it
dobbin
being
a
bit
short

wind
and

sadly
stuck
fast
in

tumbled
on

then
they
fell
to
talking
of
other
things

the
honest

to
brag
about

but
the
old
man
was
far
too
interested
in
his
own
doings
to
ask
if
his
guest
had
ever
been
in
london
it
is
the
prerogative
of
age
to
take
for
granted
that
all
younger
men
are
of
no
account
and
even
as
children
to
be
seen
and
not
heard

the
squire
at

with

been
considerably
reduced
by
the
united
efforts
of
the
squire
the
famished
hunter
and
those
below
the
salt
during
the
meal
such
scraps
of
conversation
as
this
might
have
been
heard
will
you
please
to
take
a
bit
of
bacon
master
shakespeare
not
any
i
thank
you
replied
the
poet
what
no
bacon
put
in
the
serving
man
from
behind
in
a
voice
of
surprise
bordering
on
disappointment
no

me
i
thank
you
never

repeated
shakespeare
with
some
emphasis
then
the
master
of
the
house
would
occasionally
address
a
remark
to
his
serving
man
about
the
farm
such
as
how
a
good
yoke

how
a

how
much
are
they
worth

the

asking

then

these
were
the
squire
last
words
that
night
he
soon
slept
peacefully
as
was
his
wont
after
his
evening
meal
whereupon
the
poet
with
his
accustomed
gallantry
commenced
making
love
in
right
good
earnest
to
the
fair
daughter
of
the
house
the
cotswold
girls
like
the
irish
have
always
been
famous
for
their
beauty
even
amongst
the
peasants
you
may
nowadays
see
the
most
beautiful
and
graceful
women
in
the
world
though
their
attire
is
usually
of
a
plain
and
unbecoming
character
and
but
ill
adapted
to
set
off
the
features
and
form
of
the
wearer
the
squire
daughter
whom
we
will
call
jessica
was
no
exception
to
the
rule
she
was
a
handsome
brunette
indeed
the
squire
called
her
a
black
ousel
shakespeare
fell
in
love
with
her
at
once
and
forgetting
all
about
the
family
at
stratford
he
plunged
into
the
most
desperate
flirtation
the
girl
with
that
natural
perception
of
the
divine
in
man
common
to
her
sex
could
not
help
feeling
a
strange
admiration
for
this
unexpected
though
not
unwelcome
guest
there
was
something
about
his
countenance
which
exercised
a
peculiar
charm
and
fascination
the
thoughtful
brow
the
keen
hazel
eye
and
the
gentle
bearing
of
the
man
were
what
at
first
attracted
attention
but
it
was
his
manner
and
speech
half
serious
and
half
mirthful
which
made
such
an
impression
on
her
mind
and
perhaps
she
felt
that
to
the
face
whose
beauty
is
the
harmony
between
that
which
speaks
from
within
and
the
form
through
which
it
speaks
power
is
added
by
all
that
causes
the
outer
man
to
bear
more
deeply
the
impress
of
the
inner
the
surroundings
too
were
as
romantic
as
they
possibly
could
be
a
pair
of
rush
candles
were
shedding
their
dim
light
through
the
long
low
apartment
they
were
the
only
lights
that
were
burning
and
even
these
flickered
ominously
at
times
as
if
threatening
to
go
out
and
leave
the
place
in
total
darkness

full

was
casting
her
silvery
beams
through
the
great
lattice
casement
and
in
one
of
the
upper
panes
of
this
window
were
richly
emblazoned
the
arms
of
which
the
squire
was
so
proud
it
was
a
glorious
evening
opening
the
window
william
shakespeare
looked
out
upon
the
peaceful

shedding
a
pale
light
upon
the

and
the
stream
decking
with
liquid
pearl

bladed

a

away
the
silent

was
gliding
slowly
onwards
towards
the

owls
were
breathing
heavily
in
the
hanging
wood
and
a
pair
of
otters
were
hunting
in
the
pool
as
the
two
sat
by
the
open
window
the
poet
own
life
and
its
prospects
formed
the
principal
topic
of
conversation
after
years
of
toil
in
london
his
fortunes
were
beginning
at
length
to
improve
he
was
manager
of
a
theatre
and
was
at
length
earning
a
moderate
competency
he
had
already
saved
a
little
money
and
hoped
soon
to
buy
a
house
at
stratford
he
looked
forward
some
day
to
returning
to
his
native
place
and
living
a
country
life
at
present
he
was
enjoying
a
short
holiday
the
first
for
over
a
year
as
they
sat
and
talked
over
these
matters
a
minstrel
began
to
play
in
one
of
the
cottages
of
the
village
the
sound
of
the
harp
added
another
charm
to
the
peaceful
surroundings
and
filled
the
poet
mind
with
a
strange
delight
i
am
never
merry
when
i
hear
sweet
music
said
jessica
whereupon
her
companion
replied

but
in
his
motion
like
an
angel
sings
still
quiring
to

cherubins

harmony
is
in

doth
grossly
close

the

on

yearnings
of
the
soul

man
towards
the
hidden
destinies
of
the
boundless

it
was
not
long
however
before
shakespeare
bade
the
fair
jessica

retired
to
his
sleeping
apartment
for
a
run
of
such
uncommon
excellence
as
he
had
enjoyed
that
day
was
calculated
to
produce
the
tired

not
unpleasant
sensation
which
even
now
sends
the
hunting
man
sleepy
though
happy
to
bed
so
lulled
by
the
strains
of
the
minstrel
harp
did
william

seek
his
couch
and
sleep
the
sleep
of
the
just
but
even
while
the
body
was
wrapped
in
slumber
the
highly
wrought
powerful
mind

unconscious
of
its
awful
destiny
was
hard
at

at

the
yeoman
opened
the
door
of
a

called

shortly
appeared

william

started
an

the

the

began
soliloquising
again
somewhat
after

strange

shakespeare
writes
down
from

the
yeoman
makes
up
to
the

says

raising

added
he
as
mild

man
as
ever
scuttled

shakespeare
hurriedly
draws
out
notebook
and
smilingly
writes
down
the
parson
words
then
in
perfect
good
humour
he
says
you
must
excuse
me
gentlemen
but
i
have
somewhat

a
passion
for

down

keep
squire
let
go
the
hawk
tom
there
a
great
lanky
heron
risin
at
the
withybed
yonder
and
here
it
is
necessary
to
say
something
about
the
methods
and
language
of
falconry
as
practised
by
our
forefathers
shakespeare
tells
us
to
choose
a
falcon
or
tercel
for
flying
at
the
brook
and
a
hawk
for
the
bush
in
other
words
we
are
to
select
the
nobler
species
the
peregrine
falcon
the
male
of
which
was
called
a
for
flying
at
the
heron
or
the
mallard
and
a
hawk
such
as
the
goshawk
or
for
blackbirds
and
other
hedgerow
birds
for
as
madden
explains
not
only
does
the
true
falcon
be
she
peregrine
gerfalcon
merlin
or
hobby
differ
in
size
and
structure
of
wing
and
beak
from
the
hawks
but
she
also
differs
in
her
method
of
hunting
and
seizing
her
prey
the
falcons
are
hawks
of
the
tower
and
lure
they
tower
aloft
and
swoop
down
on
partridge
rabbit
or
heron
finally
returning
to
the
lure
and
be
it
noted
that
the
lure
is
a
sham
bird
with
a
train
of
food
to
entice
the
falcons
back
to
their
master
the
hawks
on
the
other
hand
are
birds
of
the
fist
or
the
bush
instead
of
towering
and
stooping
they
lurch
after
their
prey
in
wandering
flight
finally
returning
to
their
master
fist
in
we
find
allusion
to
the
falcon
towering
in
her
pride
of
place
and
indeed
there
is
no
prettier
sport
on
a
still
day
than
a
flight
at
the
partridge
or
the
heron
with
the
noble
peregrine
falcon
or
her
mate
the
at
the
honest
squire
word
of
command
a
male
peregrine
is
forthwith
despatched
and
soaring
upwards
into
the
air
he
is
almost
lost
to
sight
in
the
clouds
though
the
faint
tinkling
of
the
bells
attached
to
his
feet
may
yet
be
heard
then
stooping
from
the
skies
the
descends
from
the
heavens
and
strikes
his
adversary
down
down
they
come
fighting
and
struggling
in
the
air
until
exhausted
by
the
unequal
combat
the
heron
gradually
falls
to
the
ground
and
receives
from
the
falconer
his
final
de
sometimes
a
pair
of
hawks
are
thrown
off
against
a
heron
now
comes
a
flight
at
the
partridge
first
of
all
the
spaniel
is
despatched
to
search
the
fields
for
a
covey
of
birds
the
desired
quarry
being
found
he
points
to
them
and
this
time
the
female
peregrine
or
true
falcon
is
sent
on
her
way
away
she
soars
upwards
waiting
on
and
towering
in
her
pride
of
place
then
the
birds
lying
like
stones
beneath
her
savage
ken
are
flushed
by
the
dog
and
the
cruel
peregrine
after
selecting
her
bird
with
her
characteristic
swoop
brings
it
to
the
ground
if
she
is
unsuccessful
in
her
first
attempt
she
will
tower
again
and
renew
the
attack
the
riders
have
to
gallop
as
fast
as
their
nags
can
go
if
they
would
keep
in
with
the
sport
for
as
often
as
not
a
mile
or
more
of
ground
has
to
be
covered
in
a
long
flight
ere
the
falcon
souses
her
prey
after
the
flight
a
falcon
will
invariably
return
to
the
lure

but
it
was
not
the
death
of
the
poor
partridge
that
appealed
to
the
poet
mind
so
much
as
the
pride
and
cunning
of
the
mighty
peregrine
and
the
beauty
and
stillness
of
the
autumnal
morning
he
loved
to
hear
the
faint
tinkling
of
the
falcon
bells
the
homely
cry
of
the
plover
and
the
sweet
carol
of
the
lark
but
more
than
all
he
felt
the
mystery
of
the
downs
wondering
by
what
power
and
when
those
old
seas
were
converted
into
a
sea
of
grass
but
whilst
the
hawking
party
was
moving
slowly
across
the
wolds
to
try
fresh
ground
an
event
occurred
which
had
the
effect
of
bringing
the
morning
sport
as
far
as
hawks
were
concerned
to
an
abrupt
conclusion
this
was
nothing
more
nor
less
than
the
sight
of
a
great
cotswold
fox
of
the
greyhound
breed
making
his
way
towards
a
copse
on
the
squire
demesne
the
quick
eye
of
the
peregrine
family
was
the
first
to
view
him
and
forthwith
both
bill
and
his
brother
screamed
in
unison
what
that
sneaking
across
smoke
acre
yonder
is
a
fox
a
great
lanky
thieving
villainous
fox
darned
if

where
said
parson
and

excitedly
there
said

it
be
said
the
parson
now
look
thee
here
joe
peregrine
go
thee
to
the
sexton
and
tell
to
ring
the
church
bells
for
the
folks
to
come
for
a
fox
and
be
sure
and
tell
the
churchwardens
ah
said
the
poet
almost
as
excited
as
the
rest
of
the
party
do
not
stand
on
quillets
how
to
slay
him
be
it

of

has
been
a
place
of
importance
on
the
cotswolds
from
time
immemorial
the
abbreviations
cisetre
and
cysseter
were
in
use
as
long
ago
as
the
fifteenth
century
though
some
of
the
natives
are
now
in
the
habit
of
calling
it
ciren
the
correct
modern
abbreviation
is
ciceter
the
place
is
so
rich
in
roman
antiquities
that
we
must
perforce
devote
a
few
lines
to
their
consideration
a
whole
book
would
not
be
sufficient
to
do
full
justice
to
them

than
four
important
roman
roads
meet
within

the
magnificent
old
church
there
is
perhaps
no
sacred
building
except
mary
redcliffe
at
bristol
and
beverley
minster
that
we
know
of
in
england
which
for
perfect
proportion
and
symmetry
can
vie
with
the
imposing
grandeur
of
this
pile
as
seen
from
the
end
of
cirencester
the
south
porch
is
a
very
beautiful
and
ornamental
piece
of
architecture
the
work
is
of
design
the
interior
of
the
porch
consisting
of
delicately
wrought
groining
the
carving
outside
is
most
picturesque
there
being
many
handsome
niches
and
six
fine
oriel
windows
the
whole
of
the
is
crowned
with
very
large
pierced
battlements
and
crocketed
pinnacles
over
this
porch
is
one
of
those
grand
old
halls
such
as
were
built
in
former
times
in
front
of
the
churches
it
is
called
the
parvise
a
word
derived
from
the
same
source
as
paradise
which
in
the
language
of
architecture
means
a
cloistered
court
adjoining
a
church
many
of
these
beautiful
old
apartments
existed
at
one
time
in
england
but
were
pulled
down
by
religious
enthusiasts
because
they
were
considered
to
be
out
of
place
when
attached
to
the
church
and
used
for
secular
purposes
this
is
now
known
as
the
town
hall
and
contrasts
very
favourably
with
the
hideous
erections
built
in
modern
times
in
some
of
our
english
towns
for
this
purpose
the
church
of
cirencester
contains
a
large
amount
of
beautiful
perpendicular
work
in
the
grand
old
tower
are
twelve
bells
of
excellent
tone
the
early
english
stonework
in
the
chancel
and
chapels
is
very
curious
a
fine
arch
opening
from
the
nave
to
the
tower
there
is
in
fact
a
great
deal
to
be
seen
on
all
sides
which
would
delight
the
lover
of
architecture
some
ancient
brasses
of
great
interest
and
beautiful
design
in
various
parts
of
this
church
claim
attention
the
earliest
of
them
is
as
old
as
a
pulpit
cloth
of
blue
velvet
made
from
the
cape
of
one
ralph
parsons
in
and
presented
by
him
is
still
preserved
cirencester
house
stands
but
a
stone
throw
from
the
railway
station
but
is
hidden
from
sight
by
a
high
wall
and
a
gigantic
yew
hedge
behind
it
and
on
all
sides
save
one
the
park
one
of
the
largest
in
england
stretches
away
for
miles
so
beautiful
and
rural
are
the
surroundings
that
the
visitor
to
the
house
can
hardly
realise
that
the
place
is
not
far
removed
from
the
busy
haunts
of
men
the
cirencester
estate
was
purchased
by
sir
benjamin
bathurst
rather
more
than
two
hundred
years
ago
this
family
has
done
good
service
to
their
king
and
country
for
many
centuries
we
read
the
other
day
that
no
less
than
of
sir
benjamin
brothers
died
fighting
for
the
king
in
the
civil
wars
nor
have
they
been
less
conspicuous
in
serving
their
country
in
times
of
peace
the
park
which
was
designed
to
a
great
extent
by
the
first
earl
with
the
assistance
of
pope
has
been
entirely
thrown
open
to
the
people
of
cirencester
and
the
future
and
as
yet
visionary
beauties
of
the
noble
scenes
openings
and
avenues
which
that
great
poet
used
to
delight
in
dwelling
upon
have
become
accomplished
facts
the
ten
rides
lengthy
avenues
of
fine
trees
radiating
in
all
directions
from
a
central
point
in
the
middle
of
the
park
are
a
picturesque
feature
of
the
landscape
the
lover
of
horses
and
riding
finds
here
a
paradise
of
grassy
glades
where
he
can
gallop
for
miles
on
end
and
tire
the
most
obstinate
of
pullers
picnic
parties
horse
shows
cricket
matches
and
the
chase
of
the
fox
all
find
a
place
in
this
romantic
demesne
in
their
proper
seasons
the
enthusiast
for
woodland
hunting
or
the
man
who
hates
the
sight
of
a
fence
of
any
description
may
hunt
the
fox
here
day
after
day
and
never
leave
the
recesses
of
the
park
the
antiquary
will
find
much
to
delight
him
here
is
the
ancient
high
cross
erected
in
the
fourteenth
century
which
once
stood
in
front
of
the
old
ram
inn
the
pedestal
is
hewn
from
a
single
block
of
stone
and
beautifully
wrought
with
gothic
arcades
and
panelled
quatrefoils
this
and
the
shaft
are
the
sole
relics
of
the
old
cross
we
may
go
into
raptures
over
the
ruin
known
as
alfred
hall
fitted
up
as
it
is
with
black
oak
and
rusty
armour
and
all
the
pompous
simplicity
of
the
old
baronial
halls
of
england
antiquaries
of
a
certain
order
are
easily
deceived
and
this
delightful
old
ruin
though
but
two
hundred
years
old
has
been
so
skilfully
put
together
as
to
represent
an
ancient
british
castle
that
celebrated
though
indelicate
divine
dean
swift
was
like
alexander
pope
deeply
interested
in
the
designing
of
this
park
as
long
ago
as
alfred
hall
was
a
snare
and
delusion
to
antiquaries
in
that
year
swift
received
a
letter
stating
that
my
lord
bathurst
has
greatly
improved
the
which
you
may
remember
was
a
cottage
not
a
bit
better
than
an
irish
cabin
it
is
now
a
venerable
castle
and
has
been
taken
by
an
antiquary
for
one
of
king
arthur
the
kennels
of
the
hounds
are
in
the
park
here
the
lover
of
hounds
can
spend
hours
discussing
the
merits
of
songster
and
rosebud
or
the
latest
and
most
promising
additions
to
the
families
of
brocklesby
acrobat
or
cotteswold
flier
in
this
house
are
some
very
interesting
portraits
pictures
of
the
members
of
the
cabal
ministry
adorn
the
all
fine
examples
of
lely
brush
then
there
is
a
very
large
representation
of
the
duke
of
wellington
at
waterloo
mounted
on
his
favourite
charger
copenhagen
by
lawrence
two
romneys
one
sir
joshua
and
several
knellers
turning
to
the
abbey
the
seat
for
the
last
three
hundred
and
thirty
years
of
the
master
family
we
find
another
instance
of
a
large
country
house
standing
practically
in
a
town
the
house
is
situated
immediately
behind
the
church
and
within
a
stone
throw
of
the
but
on
the
side
away
from
the
town
the
view
from
this
house
extends
over
a
large
extent
of
rural
scenery
the
site
of
the
mitred
abbey
of
saint
mary
is
somewhere
hereabouts
but
in
the
time
of
the
suppression
of
the
monasteries
every
stone
of
the
old
abbey
was
pulled
down
and
carried
away
so
that
the
gateway
and
some
remnants
of
pillars
are
the
sole
traces
that
remain
this
gateway
which
is
a
very
fine
one
is
still
used
as
a
lodge
entrance
queen
elizabeth
granted
this
estate
to
richard
master
in
when
king
charles
was
at
cirencester
in
the
time
of
the
rebellion
he
twice
stayed
at
this
house
in
the
townspeople
of
cirencester
rose
in
a
body
and
tried
to
prevent
the
lord
lieutenant
of
the
county
lord
chandos
from
carrying
out
the
commission
of
array
for
a
time
they
gained
their
ends
but
in
the
following
year
there
was
a
sharp
encounter
between
prince
rupert
force
and
the
people
of
cirencester
resulting
in
the
total
defeat
of
the
latter
three
hundred
of
them
were
killed
and
over
a
thousand
taken
prisoners
they
were
confined
in
the
church
and
eventually
taken
to
oxford
where
upon
their
submitting
humbly
to
the
king
he
pardoned
them
and
they
were
released
this
is
one
account
it
is
only
fair
to
state
that
another
account
is
less
complimentary
to
charles
when
charles
ii
escaped
from
worcester
he
put
up
at
an
old
hostelry
in
cirencester
called
the
sun
king
james
and
still
later
queen
anne
paid
visits
to
this
town
altogether
the
town
of
cirencester
is
a
very
fascinating
old
place
the
lot
of
its
inhabitants
is
indeed
cast
in
pleasant
places
the
grand
bracing
air
of
the
cotswold
hills
is
a
tonic
which
drives
dull
care
away
from
these
gloucestershire
people
and
when
it
is
remembered
that
they
enjoy
the
freedom
of
lord
bathurst
beautiful
park
that
the
neighbourhood
is
in
spite
of
agricultural
depression
well
off
in
this
world
goods
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
pallid
cheeks
and
drooping
figures
to
be
met
with
in
most
of
our
towns
are
conspicuous
by
their
absence
here
the
cotswold
farmers
may
be
making
no
profit
in
these
days
of
low
prices
and
competition
but
against
this
must
be
set
the
fact
that
their
fathers
and
grandfathers
made
considerable
fortunes
in
farming
three
decades
ago
and
for
this
we
must
be
thankful
the
merry
capital
of
the
cotswolds
abounds
in
good
cheer
and
good
fellowship
all
the
year
round
and
one
has
only
to
pay
a
visit
to
the
on
a
monday
to
meet
the
best
of
fellows
and
the
most
genial
sportsmen
anywhere
to
be
found
amongst
the
farming
community
of
england
one
of
the
old
institutions
which
still
remain
in
the
cotswolds
is
the
annual
mop
or
hiring
fair
at
cirencester
these
take
place
twice
in
october
every
labouring
man
in
the
district
hurries
into
the
town
where
all
sorts
of
entertainments
are
held
in
the
including
discordant
music
and
the
usual
shows
which
go
to
make
up
a
country
fair
hiring
used
to
be
the
great
feature
of
these
fairs
in
the
days
before
local
newspapers
were
invented
every
sort
of
servant
from
a
farm
bailiff
to
a
was
hired
for
the
year
at
the
annual
mop
the
word
mop
is
derived
from
an
old
custom
which
ordained
that
the
who
came
to
find
situations
should
bring
their
badge
of
office
with
them
to
the
fair
they
came
with
their
brooms
and
mops
just
as
a
carter
would
tie
a
piece
of
whipcord
to
his
coat
and
a
hat
would
be
decorated
with
a
tuft
of
wool
time
was
when
the
labouring
man
was
never
happy
unless
he
changed
his
abode
from
year
to
year
he
would
get
tired
of
one
master
and
one
village
and
be
off
to
cirencester
mop
where
he
was
pretty
sure
to
get
a
fresh
job
but
nowadays
the
cotswold
men
are
beginning
to
realise
that
two
removes
are
as
bad
as
a
fire
the
best
of
them
stay
for
years
in
the
same
village
this
is
very
much
more
satisfactory
for
all
concerned
deeply
rooted
though
the
love
of
change
appears
to
be
in
the
hearts
of
of
the
human
race
the
restless
spirit
seldom
enjoys
real
peace
and
quiet
and
the
discontent
and
poverty
of
the
labouring
class
in
times
gone
by
may
safely
be
attributed
to
their
changes
and
removal
of
their
belongings
to
other
parts
of
the
country
now
that
these
old
fairs
no
longer
answer
the
purpose
for
which
they
existed
for
hundreds
of
years
they
will
doubtless
gradually
die
out
and
they
have
their
drawbacks
an
occasion
of
this
kind
is
always
associated
with
a
good
deal
of
drunkenness
the
old
of
cirencester
for
a
few
days
in
each
autumn
becomes
a
regular
pandemonium
it
is
marvellous
how
quickly
all
traces
of
the
great
show
are
swept
away
and
the
place
once
more
settles
down
to
the
normal
condition
of
an
though
country
town
there
are
many
old
houses
in
cirencester
of
more
than
average
interest
but
there
is
nothing
as
far
as
we
know
that
needs
special
description
the
fleece
hotel
is
one
of
the
largest
and
most
beautiful
of
the
mediaeval
buildings
it
should
be
noted
that
some
of
the
new
buildings
in
this
town
such
as
that
which
contains
the
post
office
have
been
erected
in
the
best
possible
taste
with
the
exception
of
some
of
the
work
which
bodley
has
done
at
oxford
in
recent
years
notably
the
new
buildings
at
magdalen
college
we
have
never
seen
modern
architecture
of
greater
excellence
than
these
cirencester
houses
they
are
as
picturesque
as
houses
containing
shops
possibly
can
be
hunting
from
ciceter
but
it
is
as
a
hunting
centre
that
ciceter
is
best
known
to
the
world
at
large
and
in
this
respect
it
is
almost
unique
the
melton
of
the
west
it
contains
a
large
number
of
hunting
residents
who
are
not
mere
birds
of
passage
but
men
who
live
the
best
part
of
the
year
in
or
near
the
town
the
country
round
about
from
a
hunting
point
of
view
is
good
enough
for
most
people
five
days
a
week
can
be
enjoyed
over
a
variety
of
hill
and
vale
all
of
which
is
rideable
nor
can
there
be
any
question
but
that
the
sport
obtainable
compares
favourably
with
that
enjoyed
in
the
more
grassy
midlands
not
that
there
is
much
plough
round
about
cirencester
nowadays
agricultural
depression
has
diminished
the
amount
of
arable
in
recent
years
the
best
grass
country
round
about
however
with
the
exception
of
the
crudwell
and
oaksey
district
rides
decidedly
deep
the
enclosures
are
small
and
the
fences
rough
and
straggling
a
clever
bold
horse
with
plenty
of
jumping
power
in
his
quarters
and
hocks
is
essential
it
may
safely
be
said
that
a
man
who
can
command
hounds
in
the
braydon
and
swindon
district
will
find
the
shires
comparatively
plain
sailing
the
wall
country
of
the
cotswold
tableland
is
exactly
the
reverse
of
the
vale
the
pace
there
is
often
tremendous
but
the
obstacles
are
not
formidable
enough
to
those
accustomed
to
walls
to
keep
the
eager
field
from
pressing
the
pack
save
on
those
rare
occasions
when
on
a
burning
scent
the
hounds
manage
to
get
a
start
of
horses
and
then
they
will
never
be
caught
horses
are
almost
invariably
ridden
in
this
wall
country
if
in
hard
condition
and
there
are
no
steep
hills
to
be
crossed
they
can
go
as
fast
and
stay
almost
as
long
as
hounds
for
the
going
is
good
and
they
are
always
galloping
on
the
top
of
the
ground
at
the
time
of
writing
there
are
over
two
hundred
hunters
stabled
in
the
little
town
of
cirencester
to
say
nothing
of
those
kept
at
the
numerous
hunting
boxes
around
more
than
this
need
not
be
said
to
show
the
undoubted
popularity
of
the
place
as
a
hunting
centre
and
a
very
sporting
lot
the
people
are
brought
up
to
the
sport
from
the
cradle
the
gloucestershire
natives
squires
farmers
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
men
ride
as
straight
as
a
die
from
what
has
been
said
it
will
be
readily
gathered
that
the
attraction
of
the
place
as
a
hunting
centre
lies
in
the
variety
of
country
it
commands
not
only
is
a
different
stamp
of
country
to
be
met
with
each
day
of
the
week
but
on
one
and
the
same
day
you
may
be
riding
over
banks
small
flying
fences
and
sound
grass
or
deep
ploughs
and
pasture
divided
by
hairy
bullfinches
or
again
over
light
plough
and
stone
walls
and
to
this
fact
may
be
attributed
the
exceptional
number
of
good
performers
over
a
country
that
this
district
turns
out
both
men
and
horses
have
always
appeared
to
us
to
reach
a
very
high
standard
of
cleverness
to
leicestershire
northants
warwick
and
the
vale
of
aylesbury
belongs
by
undisputed
right
the
credit
of
the
finest
grass
country
in
hunting
england
but
for
ireland
and
the
rougher
shires
i
claim
the
honour
of
showing
not
only
the
straightest
foxes
but
also
the
best
sportsmen
and
the
boldest
riders
the
reason
seems
to
me
to
be
this
in
leicestershire
you
find
the
field
composed
largely
of
smart
london
men
and
after
a
certain
age
a
man
goes
to
hounds
in
inverse
ratio
to
the
pace
at
which
he
travels
as
a
man
about
town
the
latter
with
a
few
brilliant
exceptions
to
prove
the
rule
is
not
so
quick
and
determined
when
he
sees
a
nasty
piece
of
timber
or
an
awkward
hairy
fence
as
his
reputation
at
the
clubs
would
lead
you
to
expect
whilst
the
rougher
countryman
be
he
yeoman
or
squire
farmer
or
peer
endowed
with
nerves
of
iron
is
able
to
cross
a
country
with
a
confidence
and
a
dash
that
are
denied
to
the
average
dandy
with
his
big
stud
immaculate
leathers
and
expensive
cigars
in
gloucestershire
many
an
honest
yeoman
goes
out
twice
a
week
and
endeavours
to
drown
for
a
while
all
thoughts
of
hard
times
and
low
prices
content
for
the
day
if
the
fates
have
left
him
a
sound
horse
and
the
consolation
of
a
gallop
over
the
grass
let
it
here
be
said
that
there
are
no
grooms
in
the
world
who
better
understand
conditioning
hunters
than
those
of
leicestershire
nowhere
can
you
see
horses
better
bred
or
fitter
to
go
and
he
who
rides
on
horses
must
himself
be
the

retirement

divided
into
two
packs
butt
miller
hunts
three
days
a
week
on
the
eastern
side
with
cricklade
as
his
centre
whilst
lord
bathurst
has
sufficient
ground
for
two
days
on
the
west
where
the
country
flanks
with
the
duke
of
beaufort
domain
on
the
south
and
the
cotswold
hounds
on
the
north
miller
retains
the
original
pack
and
a
very
fine
one
it
is
lord
bathurst
likewise
by
dint
of
sparing
no
pains
and
by
bringing
in
the
best
blood
obtainable
from
belvoir
brocklesby
and
other
kennels
has
gradually
brought
his
pack
to
a
high
state
of
excellence
turning
to
the
week
programme
for
a
man
hunting
five
or
six
days
a
week
from
cirencester
monday
is
the
day
for
the
duke
hounds
here
you
may
be
riding
over
some
of
the
best
of
the
grass
where
light
flying
fences
grow
on
the
top
of
low
banks
or
else
it
will
be
a
country
of
mixed
grass
and
light
plough
in
either
case
the
country
is
very
rideable
and
sport
usually
excellent
the
badminton
hounds
and
lord
worcester
skill
as
a
huntsman
are
too
well
known
to
require
any
description
here
on
tuesday
lord
bathurst
hounds
are
always
within
seven
miles
of
the
town
and
the
country
is
a
very
open
one
but
one
that
requires
plenty
of
wet
to
carry
scent
though
on
certain
days
there
is
but
little
scent
in
favourable
seasons
during
recent
years
wonderful
sport
has
been
shown
in
this
country
in
the
season
of
especially
a
fine
gallop
came
off
regularly
every
tuesday
from
october
to
the
end
of
february
in
on
the
other
hand
little
was
done
there
is
far
more
grass
than
there
used
to
be
owing
to
so
much
of
the
land
having
gone
out
of
cultivation
the
plough
rides
lighter
than
grass
does
in
nine
counties
out
of
ten
the
coverts
are
small
and
the
pace
often
tremendous
every
country
has
its
drawback
and
in
this
case
it
lies
partly
in
bad
scent
and
partly
in
the
fences
being
too
easy
men
who
know
the
walls
with
which
the
cotswold
tableland
is
almost
entirely
enclosed
ride
far
too
close
to
hounds
thus
the
pack
and
the
huntsman
not
being
allowed
a
chance
sport
is
often
spoiled
occasionally
when
a
real
scent
is
forthcoming
the
hounds
can
run
right
away
from
the
field
but
as
a
rule
they
are
shamefully
the
fact
is
that
in
the
hunting
field
as
elsewhere
john
wolcot
epigram
written
a
hundred
years
ago
exactly
hits
the
nail
on
the
head
what
rage
for
fame
attends
both
great
and
small
better
be
d
d
than
mentioned
not
at
all
we
all
want
to
ride
in
the
front
rank
and
are
or
ought
to
be
d
d
accordingly
by
the
on
wednesdays
the
cotswold
hounds
are
always
within
easy
reach
of
cirencester
there
are
few
better
packs
than
the
cotswold
started
forty
years
ago
with
part
of
the
pack
which
lord
gifford
was
giving
up
the
cotswold
hounds
have
received
strains
of
the
best
blood
of
the
brocklesby
badminton
belvoir
and
berkeley
kennels
they
have
therefore
both
speed
and
stamina
as
well
as
good
noses
their
huntsman
charles
travess
has
no
superior
as
far
as
we
know
the
result
is
that
for
dash
and
drive
these
hounds
are
unequalled
notwithstanding
the
severe
pace
at
which
they
are
able
to
run
owing
to
the
absence
of
high
hedges
and
other
impediments
for
most
of
the
country
is
enclosed
with
stone
walls
they
hunt
marvellously
well
together
and
do
not
tail
they
are
wonderfully
musical
too
more
so
than
any
other
pack
here
it
is
worth
our
while
to
analyse
briefly
the
qualities
which
combine
to
make
this
huntsman
so
deservedly
popular
with
all
who
follow
the
cotswold
hounds
we
venture
to
say
that
he
pleases
all
and
sundry
thrusters
and
alike
because
he
invariably
has
a
double
object
in
view
he
hunts
his
fox
and
he
humours
his
field
and
firstly
he
hunts
his
fox
in
the
best
possible
method
having
regard
to
the
scenting
capabilities
of
the
cotswold
hills
he
is
quick
as
lightning
yet
he
is
never
in
a
hurry
that
is
to
say
in
a
hurry
when
the
hounds
throw
up
or
check
like
all
other
good
huntsmen
he
gives
them
plenty
of
time
he
stands
still
and
he
his
field
stand
then
may
be
seen
that
magnificent
proof
of
canine
the
forward
movement
of
a
pack
of
foxhounds
making
good
by
two
distinct
casts
the
ground
that
lies
in
front
of
them
and
on
each
side
should
they
fail
to
hit
off
the
line
the
advantage
of
a
brilliant
huntsman
immediately
asserts
itself
partly
by
certain
set
rules
and
partly
by
a
knowledge
of
the
country
and
the
run
of
foxes
but
more
than
all
by
that
genius
which
was
the
making
of
shakespeare
and
the
great
men
of
all
time
he
takes
his
hounds
admirably
in
hand
aided
by
two
quiet
unassuming
and
in
four
cases
out
of
five
brings
them
either
at
the
first
or
second
cast
to
the
very
hedgerow
where
five
minutes
before
reynard
took
his
sneaking
solitary
way
it
may
be
forward
or
it
may
be
down
wind
right
or
but
it
is
at
all
events
the
way
thus
owing
to
this
happy
knack
of
making
the
proper
cast
at
a
large
percentage
of
checks
this
man
establishes
his
reputation
as
a
huntsman
should
the
day
be
propitious
a
run
is
now
assured
unless
some
unforeseen
occurrence
such
as
the
fox
going
to
ground
necessitates
a
draw
for
a
fresh
one
but
in
any
case
owing
to
this
marvellous
knack
of
hitting
off
the
line
at
the
first
check
our
huntsman
generally
contrives
to
show
a
run
some
time
during
the
day
so
much
for
the
methods
by
which
this
william
shakespeare
of
the
hunting
field
is
wont
to
pursue
his
fox
but
we
have
not
done
with
him
yet
what
does
he
do
on
those
bad
scenting
days
which
on
the
dry
and
stony
cotswold
hills
are
the
rule
rather
than
the
exception
on
such
days
as
well
as
hunting
his
fox
he
humours
his
field
in
the
first
place
unless
he
has
distinct
proof
to
the
contrary
he
invariably
gives
his
fox
credit
for
being
a
one
he
keeps
moving
on
at
a
steady
pace
in
the
direction
in
which
his
instinct
and
knowledge
lead
him
even
though
there
may
be
no
scent
either
on
the
ground
or
in
the
air
to
guide
the
hounds
every
piece
of
good
scenting
ground
and
he
knows
the
capabilities
of
every
field
in
this
respect
is
made
the
most
of
carrying
or
dusty
ploughs
are
scrupulously
avoided
if
he
lifts
it
is
done
so
quietly
and
cunningly
that
the
majority
of
the
riders
are
unaware
of
the
fact
and
the
hounds
never
become
wild
and
untractable
it
is
this
free
and
generous
method
of
hunting
the
fox
that
pleases
his
followers
travess
casts
are
not
made
in
cramped
and
stingy
fashion
but
a
wide
extent
of
country
is
covered
even
on
a
bad
day
there
is
no
after
a
time
all
save
a
dozen
sportsmen
are
left
several
fields
behind
they
wo
run
is
the
general
cry
there
is
no
hurry
but
meantime
some
large
grass
fields
are
met
with
or
the
huntsman
brings
the
pack
on
to
better
terms
with
the
fox
or
maybe
a
fresh
one
jumps
up
and
away
go
the
hounds
for
seven
or
eight
minutes
as
hard
as
they
can
pelt
only
a
dozen
men
know
exactly
what
has
happened
most
of
the
thrusters
and
all
the
have
to
gallop
in
earnest
for
half
an
hour
to
come
up
with
the
hunt
indeed
on
many
days
they
never
see
either
huntsman
or
hounds
again
and
go
tearing
about
the
country
cursing
their
luck
in
missing
so
fine
a
run
it
is
the
old
story
of
the
hare
and
the
tortoise
but
herein
lies
the
humour
of
it
the
hare
is
pleased
and
the
tortoise
is
pleased
the
former
as
represented
by
the
field
has
enjoyed
a
fine
scamper
and
lots
of
air
bother
the
currant
jelly
and
exercise
the
tortoise
on
the
other
hand
has
had
a
fine
hunting
run
and
possibly
by
creeping
slowly
on
for
some
hours
it
has
killed
its
fox
whilst
several
good
sportsmen
have
enjoyed
an
hunt
in
a
wild
country
with
a
kill
in
the
open
sap
if
you
want
to
humour
your
field
you
must
leave
them
behind
it
must
not
be
done
intentionally
however
the
riders
must
be
allowed
so
to
speak
to
work
out
their
own
salvation
in
this
respect
major
de
freville
country
as
a
whole
is
more
suited
to
the
houndman
than
for
him
who
hunts
to
ride
the
hills
save
in
one
district
are
so
severe
that
hounds
often
beat
horses
the
result
is
many
are
tempted
to
station
themselves
on
the
top
of
a
hill
whence
a
wide
view
is
obtainable
and
trust
to
the
hounds
coming
back
after
running
a
ring
given
the
right
sort
of
horse
however
thoroughbred
if
possible
and
with
good
enough
manners
to
descend
a
steep
place
without
boring
and
tearing
his
rider
arms
almost
out
of
their
sockets
many
a
fine
run
may
be
seen
in
this
wild
district
much
of
the
arable
land
has
gone
back
to
grass
so
that
it
is
quite
a
fair
scenting
country
and
the
foxes
are
stronger
and
more
than
in
more
civilised
parts
one
of
the
best
days
the
writer
ever
had
in
his
life
was
with
these
hounds
meeting
at
puesdown
they
ran
for
an
hour
in
the
morning
at
a
great
pace
with
an
point
whilst
in
the
afternoon
came
a
run
of
hours
with
a
point
of
somewhere
about
ten
miles
with
the
exception
of
a
small
vale
between
cheltenham
and
tewkesbury
which
is
very
good
indeed
the
puesdown
country
is
about
the
best
the
undulations
being
less
severe
than
in
other
parts
on
thursdays
cirencester
commands
miller
braydon
country
this
country
is
a
very
great
contrast
to
that
which
is
ridden
over
on
tuesdays
and
wednesdays
and
requires
a
very
stout
horse
it
rides
tremendously
deep
at
times
and
the
fences
which
come
very
frequently
in
a
run
owing
to
the
small
size
of
the
enclosures
are
both
big
and
blind
it
is
practically
all
grass
but
there
are
several
large
woodlands
with
deep
clay
rides
in
which
one
is
not
unlikely
to
spend
a
part
of
thursday
and
these
woods
owing
in
part
to
the
shooting
being
let
to
londoners
are
none
too
plentifully
provided
with
foxes
wire
too
has
sprung
up
in
some
parts
of
miller
braydon
country
few
people
have
large
enough
studs
to
stand
the
wear
and
tear
of
this
fine
wild
country
consequently
the
fields
are
generally
small
sport
though
not
so
good
as
it
used
to
be
is
still
very
fair
and
to
run
down
to
great
wood
in
the
duke
country
is
sufficient
to
tax
the
powers
of
the
finest
hunter
whilst
only
the
man
with
a
quick
eye
to
a
country
can
live
with
hounds
it
is
often
stated
that
blood
horses
are
the
best
for
galloping
through
deep
ground
this
is
true
in
one
way
though
not
on
the
whole
thoroughbred
horses
are
practically
useless
in
this
sort
of
country
their
feet
are
often
so
small
that
they
stick
in
the
deep
clay
a
horse
with
small
feet
is
no
good
at
all
in
braydon
a
irish
hunter
about
three
parts
bred
with
tremendous
strength
in
hocks
and
quarters
and
biggish
feet
is
the
sort
the
writer
would
choose
if
up
to
quite
two
stone
more
than
his
rider
weight
and
a
safe
and
temperate
fencer
he
will
carry
you
well
up
with
hounds
over
any
country
a
fast
horse
is
not
required
for
a
racer
that
can
do
the
mile
on
the
flat
at
newmarket
in
something
under
two
minutes
is
reduced
in
really
deep
ground
to
an
canter
and
your
horse
from
the
emerald
isle
will
leave
him
standing
still
in
the
braydon
vale
some
countries
never
ride
really
deep
the
shires
for
instance
though
often
said
to
be
deep
will
seldom
let
a
horse
in
to
any
great
extent
the
ridge
and
furrow
drains
the
field
so
well
and
in
that
sort
of
deep
ground
which
is
met
with
in
leicestershire
a
thoroughbred
one
will
gallop
and
stay
all
day
but
a
ride
in
braydon
or
in
the
bicester
claydons
will
convince
us
that
a
stouter
stamp
of
horse
is
necessary
to
combat
a
deep
undrained
clay
country
we
must
now
leave
the
sporting

dear
to
the

man
are
green
fields

where
the

are
fair
and
clean
and
the

broad
and
deep
where
there
is
room
to

to

cross
this
country
there
are
always
wigs
on

and
in

of

we
may
still

at

allow
us
to
despise

round
oaksey
too
is
a
rare

should
you
be
lucky
enough
to
get
a
start
from
flistridge
and
come
down
to
the
brook
at
a
jumpable
place
in
less

ten

you
will
be

not
paradise
at
all
events
as
near
as
you
are
ever
likely
to
be
on

this
is
literally
true
for
half
way
between
flistridge
and
kemble

and
in
the
midst
of
elysian
grass
fields
is
a
narrow
strip
of
covert
happily
christened
paradise
would
that
there
was
a
larger
extent
of
this
sort
of
country
for
it
is
not
every
friday
that
hounds
cross
it
the
duke
hounds
have
a
happy
knack
of
crossing
it
occasionally
on
a
monday
however
and
on
thursdays
miller
hounds
may
drive
a
fox
that
way
this
district
is
not
so
easy
for
a
stranger
to
ride
his
own
line
over
as
the
midlands
it
is
not
half
so
stiff
but
it
is
often
cramped
and
trappy
but
then
you
must
look
before
you
leap
in
most
countries
nowadays
in
this
friday
country
wire
is
comparatively
scarce
the
fields
run
very
large
on
this
day
quite
two
hundred
horsemen
are
to
be
seen
at
favourite
fixtures
about
half
this
number
would
belong
to
the
country
and
the
other
half
come
from
the
duke
country
and
elsewhere
these
friday
fields
are
as
well
mounted
and
well
appointed
as
any
in
england
and
to
see
a
run
one
must
have
a
good
horse
not
necessarily
an
expensive
one
for
good
and
expensive
are
by
no
means
synonymous
terms
with
regard
to
horseflesh
it
is
with
regret
that
we
must
add
that
foxes
were
decidedly
scarce
here
last
season
on
saturdays
the
cirencester
brigade
will
hunt
with
miller
fairford
lechlade
kempsford
and
are
some
of
the
meets
here
we
have
a
totally
different
country
from
any
yet
considered
it
is
a
wonderfully
sporting
one
and
last
season
these
hounds
never
had
a
bad
saturday
and
often
a
resulted
here
again
one
can
never
anticipate
what
sort
of
ground
will
be
traversed
but
the
best
of
it
consists
of
a
fine
open
country
of
grass
and
plough
intermingled
the
fields
being
intersected
by
small
flying
fences
and
exceptionally
wide
and
deep
ditches
snowstorm
a
small
gorse
half
way
between
fairford
and
lechlade
stations
on
the
great
western
railway
is
a
favourite
draw
if
a
fox
goes
away
you
see
men
sitting
down
in
their
saddles
and
cramming
at
the
fences
as
hard
as
their
horses
can
gallop
there
appears
to
be
nothing
to
jump
until
you
are
close
up
to
the
fence
but
nevertheless
pace
is
required
to
clear
them
for
there
is
hardly
a
ditch
anywhere
round
snowstorm
that
is
not
ten
feet
wide
and
eight
feet
or
more
deep
and
if
you
are
unlucky
your
horse
may
have
to
clear
fourteen
feet
on
the
other
hand
there
is
absolutely
nothing
that
a
horse
going
fast
can
not
clear
almost
without
an
effort
if
he
jumps
at
all
so
you
may
ride
in
confidence
at
every
fence
and
take
it
where
you
please
the
depth
of
the
ditch
is
what
frightens
a
timid
horse
and
i
may
add
a
timid
rider
and
if
your
horse
stops
dead
and
then
tries
to
jump
it
standing
you
are
very
apt
to
tumble
in
a
rare
sporting
country
is
this
district
and
as
the
horses
and
their
riders
know
it
there
are
comparatively
few
falls
round
kempsford
and
lechlade
the
thames
and
the
canal
are
apt
to
get
in
the
way
but
once
clear
of
these
impediments
a
very
open
country
is
entered
either
of
grass
and
flying
fences
or
light
plough
and
stone
walls
another
style
of
country
is
that
round
hannington
and
crouch
in
old
days
before
wire
was
known
this
used
to
be
the
best
grass
country
in
the
but
nowadays
you
must
look
before
you
leap
with
a
good
fox
however
hounds
may
take
you
into
the
best
of
the
old
berkshire
vale
and
perhaps
right
up
to
the
swindon
hills
round
is
a
fine
grass
country
good
enough
for
anybody
but
the
increase
of
wire
is
becoming
more
and
more
difficult
to
combat
in
this
as
in
other
grazing
districts
of
england
the
very
varied
bill
of
fare
we
have
briefly
sketched
for
a
man
hunting
from
cirencester
may
include
an
occasional
wednesday
with
the
heythrop
at
bradwell
grove
it
is
not
possible
to
reach
the
choicest
part
of
this
pleasant
country
by
road
from
cirencester
but
some
of
the
best
of
the
country
of
the
cotswold
tableland
is
included
in
the
heythrop
domain
everybody
who
has
been
brought
up
to
hunting
has
heard
of
jem
hills
and
bradwell
grove
rare
gallops
this
celebrated
huntsman
used
to
show
over
the
wolds
in
days
gone
by
and
on
a
good
scenting
day
it
requires
a
quick
horse
to
live
with
these
hounds
a
fast
and
pack
established
more
than
sixty
years
ago
they
have
been
admirably
presided
over
by
albert
brassey
for
close
on
a
quarter
of
a
century
several
pleasant
vales
intersect
this
country
notably
the
bourton
and
the
gawcombe
vale
and
there
is
excellent
grass
round
as
however
the
grass
country
of
the
heythrop
is
too
far
from
cirencester
to
be
reached
by
road
it
hardly
comes
within
our
scope
if
hunting
is
doomed
to
extinction
in
the
midlands
owing
to
the
growth
of
barbed
wire
it
is
exceedingly
unlikely
ever
to
die
out
in
the
neighbourhood
of
cirencester
for
there
is
so
much
poor
unprofitable
land
on
the
cotswold
tableland
and
in
the
braydon
district
that
barbed
wire
and
other
evils
of
civilisation
are
not
likely
to
interfere
to
deprive
us
of
our
national
sport
hunting
men
have
but
to
be
true
to
themselves
and
avoid
doing
unnecessary
damage
to
see
the
sport
carried
on
in
the
twentieth
century
as
it
has
been
in
the
past
if
we
conform
to
the
unwritten
laws
of
the
chase
and
pay
for
the
damage
we
do
there
will
be
no
fear
of
dying
out
england
will
be
merrie
england
still
even
in
the
twentieth
century
the
glorious
pastime
sole
relic
of
the
days
of
chivalry
will
continue
among
us
cheering
the
life
in
our
quiet
country
villages
through
the
gloomy
winter
months
if
only
we
be
true
to
ourselves
and
do
our
uttermost
to
further
the
interests
of
the
grandest
sport
on
earth
as
i
have
given
an
account
of
a
run
over
the
walls
and
as
the
ciceter
people
set
most
store
on
a
gallop
over
the
stiff
fences
and
grass
enclosures
of
their
vale
here
follows
a
brief
description
in
verse
of
the
glories
of
fifty
minutes
on
the
grass
i
have
called
it
the
thruster
song
because
on
the
whole
i
thoroughly
agree
with
shakespeare
that
valour
is
the
chietest
virtue
and
most
dignifies
the
haver
hard
riding
and
all
sports
which
involve
an
element
of
danger
are
the
best
antidotes
to
that
luxury
and
effeminacy
which
long
periods
of
peace
are
apt
to
foster
what
would
become
of
the
young
men
of
the
present
day
those
i
mean
who
are
in
the
habit
of
following
the
hounds
if
hard
riding
were
to
become
unfashionable
i
can
not
conceive
anything
more
ridiculous
than
the
sight
of
a
couple
of
hundred
men
riding
day
after
day
in
a
slow
procession
through
gates
craning
at
the
smallest
obstacles
or
dismounting
and
leading
over
no
hard
riding
is
the
best
antidote
in
the
world
for
the
luxurious
tendency
of
these
days
a
hundred
years
ago
when
the
sport
of
was
in
its
infancy
and
modern
conditions
of
pace
were
unknown
there
was
less
need
for
this
kind
of
recreation
the
image
of
war
without
its
guilt
and
only
per
cent
of
its
danger
for
there
was
real
fighting
enough
to
be
done
in
olden
times
and
amongst
hunting
folk
though
there
was
much
drinking
there
was
little
luxury
therefore
our
ancestors
were
content
to
enjoy
slow
hunting
runs
and
small
blame
to
them
but
those
who
are
fond
of
lamenting
the
modern
spirit
of
the
age
which
prefers
the
forty
minutes
burst
over
a
severe
country
to
a
three
hours
hunting
run
are
apt
to
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
in
these
piping
times
of
peace
without
the
risks
of
sport
mankind
is
liable
to
degenerate
towards
effeminacy
for
this
reason
in
the
following
poem
i
have
purposely
taken
up
the
cudgels
for
that
somewhat
unpopular
class
of
sportsmen
the
thrusters
of
the
hunting
field
they
are
unpopular
with
masters
of
hounds
because
they
ride
too
close
to
the
pack
but
as
a
general
rule
they
are
the
only
people
who
ever
see
a
really
fast
run
in
shakespeare
time
hounds
that
went
too
fast
for
the
rest
of
the
pack
were
trashed
for
that
is
to
say
they
were
handicapped
by
a
strap
attached
to
their
necks
in
the
same
way
in
every
hunt
nowadays
there
are
half
a
dozen
individuals
who
have
reduced
riding
to
hounds
to
such
an
art
that
no
pack
can
get
away
from
them
in
a
moderately
easy
country
these
bruisers
of
the
hunting
field
ought
to
be
made
to
carry
three
stone
dead
weight
they
should
be
trashed
for
overtopping
however
as
brooksby
has
tersely
put
it
some
men
hunt
to
ride
and
some
ride
to
hunt
others
thank
heaven
double
their
fun
by
doing
both
there
are
many
many
fine
riders
in
england
who
will
not
be
denied
in
crossing
a
stiff
country
and
who
at
the
same
time
are
interested
in
the
hounds
and
in
the
poetry
of
sport
men
to
whom
the
mysteries
of
scent
and
of
woodcraft
as
well
as
the
breeding
and
management
of
hounds
are
something
more
than
a
mere
name
men
who
in
after
days
recall
with
pleasure
how
in
glancing
over
the
pack
they
have
been
gratified
by
the
shining
coat
the
sparkling
eye
sure
symptoms
of
fitness
for
the
fight
how
when
thrown
in
to
covert
every
hound
has
been
hidden
how
every
sprig
of
gorse
has
bristled
with
motion
how
when
viewed
away
by
the
the
fox
stole
under
the
hedge
how
the
huntsman
clapped
round
and
with
a
few
toots
of
his
horn
brought
them
out
in
a
body
how
without
tying
on
the
line
they
to
head
how
when
they
got
hold
of
it
they
drove
it
and
with
their
heads
up
felt
the
scent
on
both
sides
of
the
fence
how
with
hardly
a
whimper
they
turned
with
him
till
at
the
end
of
fifty
minutes
they
threw
up
how
the
patient
huntsman
stood
still
how
they
made
their
own
cast
and
how
when
they
came
back
on
his
line
their
tongues
doubled
and
they
marked
him
for
their
own

such
good
men

they

not

therefore
if

spring
in
the
cotswolds
whilst
walking
by
the
river
one
day
in
may
i
noticed
a
brood
of
wild
ducks
about
a
week
old
the
old
ones
are
wonderfully
tame
at
this
time
of
year
the
mother
evidently
disliked
my
intrusion
for
she
started
off
up
stream
followed
by
her
offspring
making
towards
a
withybed
a
hundred
yards
or
so
higher
up
where
a
secluded
spring
gives
capital
shelter
for
duck
and
other
shy
birds
what
was
my
surprise
a
couple
of
hours
later
to
see
the
same
lot
emerge
from
some
rushes
of
a
mile
up
stream
they
had
circumvented
a
small
waterfall
and
the
current
is
very
strong
in
places
part
of
the
journey
must
have
been
done
on
dry
land
at
the
same
moment
that
i
startled
this
brood
out
of
the
rushes
a
moorhen
swam
slowly
out
accompanied
by
her
mate
it
was
evident
from
her
cries
and
her
anxious
behaviour
that
she
too
had
some
young
ones
in
the
rushes
and
soon
two
tiny
little
black
balls
of
fur
crawled
out
from
the
bank
and
made
for
the
opposite
shore
either
from
blindness
or
fright
they
did
not
join
their
parents
in
mid
stream
but
hurried
across
to
the
opposite
bank
and
scrambled
on
to
the
mud
followed
by
the
old
couple
remonstrating
with
them
on
their
foolishness
the
mother
then
succeeded
in
persuading
one
of
them
to
follow
her
to
a
place
of
safety
underneath
some
overhanging
boughs
but
the
other
was
left
clinging
to
the
bank
crying
piteously
i
went
round
by
a
bridge
in
the
hope
of
being
able
to
place
the
helpless
little
thing
on
the
water
but
alas
by
the
time
i
got
to
the
spot
it
was
dead
the
exertion
of
crossing
the
stream
had
been
too
much
for
it
for
it
was
probably
not
twelve
hours
old
when
there
are
young
ones
about
moorhens
will
not
dive
to
get
out
of
your
sight
unless
their
children
dive
too
it
is
pretty
to
see
them
swimming
on
the
side
of
their
progeny
buoying
them
up
in
case
the
current
should
prove
too
strong
and
carry
them
down
if
there
are
eggs
still
unhatched
the
father
when
disturbed
takes
the
little
ones
away
to
a
safer
spot
whilst
the
mother
sticks
to
the
nest
but
they
are
rather
stupid
for
even
the
day
after
the
eggs
are
hatched
on
being
disturbed
by
a
casual
the
old
cock
swims
out
into
mid
stream
he
then
calls
to
his
tiny
progeny
to
follow
him
though
they
are
utterly
incapable
of
doing
so
and
generally
come
to
hopeless
grief
in
the
attempt
then
the
old
ones
are
not
very
clever
at
finding
children
that
have
been
frightened
away
from
the
nest
i
marked
one
down
on
the
opposite
bank
and
could
see
it
crawling
beneath
some
sticks
but
the
old
bird
kept
swimming
past
the
spot
and
appeared
to
neither
hear
nor
see
the
little
ball
of
fur
perhaps
he
was
playing
cunning
he
may
have
imagined
that
the
bird
was
invisible
to
me
and
was
trying
to
divert
my
attention
from
the
spot
moorhens
are
always
interesting
to
watch
with
a
pair
of
an
amusing
and
instructive
half
hour
may
often
be
spent
by
the
stream
in
the
breeding
season
i
was
much
amused
while
feeding
some
swans
and
a
couple
of
wild
ducks
the
other
day
to
notice
that
the
mallard
would
attack
the
swans
if
they
took
any
food
that
he
fancied
one
would
have
thought
that
such
powerful
birds
as
swans
one
stroke
of
whose
wings
is
supposed
to
be
capable
of
breaking
a
man
leg
would
not
have
stood
any
nonsense
from
an
unusually
diminutive
mallard
but
not
a
bit
of
it
the
mallard
ruled
the
roost
all
the
other
birds
even
the
great
swans
ran
away
from
him
when
he
attacked
them
from
behind
with
his
beak
this
state
of
things
continued
for
some
days
but
after
a
time
the
male
swan
got
tired
of
the
game
his
patience
was
exhausted
watching
his
opportunity
he
seized
the
pugnacious
little
mallard
by
the
neck
and
gave
him
a
thundering
good
shaking
it
was
most
laughable
to
watch
them
it
is
characteristic
of
swans
that
they
are
unable
to
look
you
in
the
face
and
beautiful
beyond
all
description
as
they
appear
to
be
in
their
proper
element
meet
them
on
dry
land
and
they
become
hideous
and
uninteresting
scowling
at
you
with
an
evil
eye
sometimes
as
you
are
walking
under
the
trees
on
the
banks
of
the
coln
you
come
across
a
little
heap
of
chipped
wood
lying
on
the
ground
then
you
hear
tap
tap
in
the
branches
above
it
is
the
little
nuthatch
hard
at
work
scooping
out
his
home
in
the
bark
he
sways
his
body
with
every
stroke
of
his
beak
and
is
so
busy
he
takes
no
notice
of
you
the
nuthatch
is
very
fond
of
filberts
as
his
name
implies
you
may
see
him
in
the
autumn
with
a
nut
firmly
fixed
in
a
crevice
in
the
bark
of
a
hazel
branch
and
he
taps
away
until
he
pierces
the
shell
and
gets
at
the
kernel
nuthatches
which
are
very
plentiful
hereabouts
are
sometimes
to
be
found
in
the
forsaken
homes
of
woodpeckers
which
they
plaster
round
with
mud
the
entrance
to
the
hole
in
the
tree
is
thus
made
small
enough
to
suit
them
sometimes
when
i
have
disturbed
a
nuthatch
at
work
at
a
hole
in
a
tree
the
little
fellow
would
pop
into
the
hole
and
peep
out
at
me
never
moving
until
i
had
departed
woodpeckers
are
somewhat
uncommon
here
i
have
not
heard
one
in
our
garden
by
the
river
for
a
very
long
time
though
a
foolish
farmer
told
me
the
other
day
that
he
had
recently
shot
one
a
mile
or
so
away
at
barnsley
park
where
the
oaks
thrive
on
a
vein
of
clay
soil
green
woodpeckers
may
often
be
seen
and
heard
what
more
beautiful
bird
is
there
even
in
the
tropics
than
the
merry
yaffel
with
his
emerald
back
and
the
red
tuft
on
his
head
the
other
two
varieties
of
woodpeckers
the
greater
and
lesser
spotted
are
occasionally
met
with
on
the
cotswolds
i
do
not
know
why
we
have
so
few
green
woodpeckers
by
the
river
as
there
are
plenty
of
old
trees
there
but
these
birds
which
feed
chiefly
on
the
ground
among
the
anthills
have
a
marked
preference
for
such
woods
in
the
neighbourhood
as
contain
an
abundance
of
oak
trees
the
local
name
for
these
birds
is
which
tom
peregrine
pronounces
heckle
there
is
no
more
pleasing
sound
than
the
long
chattering
note
of
the
green
woodpecker
it
breaks
so
suddenly
on
the
general
silence
of
the
woods
contrasting
as
it
does
in
its
loud
tones
with
the
soft
cooing
of
the
doves
and
the
songs
of
the
other
birds
in
various
places
along
its
course
the
river
has
long
poles
set
across
it
on
these
poles
tom
peregrine
has
placed
traps
for
stoats
weasels
and
other
vermin
recently
when
we
were
fishing
he
pointed
out
a
great
stoat
caught
in
one
of
these
traps
with
a
in
its
mouth
a
very
strange
occurrence
for
the
trap
was
only
a
small
one
of
the
usual
rabbit
size
and
the
rat
was
almost
as
big
as
the
stoat
there
is
so
little
room
for
the
bodies
of
a
stoat
and
a
rat
in
one
of
these
small
iron
traps
that
the
betting
must
be
at
least
a
thousand
to
one
against
such
an
event
happening
unless
we
had
seen
it
with
our
eyes
we
could
not
have
believed
it
possible
the
stoat
in
chasing
the
rat
along
the
pole
must
have
seized
his
prey
at
the
very
instant
that
the
jaws
of
the
trap
snapped
upon
them
both
they
were
quite
dead
when
we
found
them
every
one
acquainted
with
gamekeepers
duties
is
well
aware
that
the
iron
traps
armed
with
teeth
which
are
in
general
use
throughout
the
country
are
a
disgrace
to
civilisation
it
is
a
terrible
experience
to
take
a
rabbit
or
any
other
animal
out
of
one
of
these
relics
of
barbarism
sir
herbert
maxwell
recently
called
the
attention
of
game
preservers
and
keepers
to
a
patent
trap
which
colonel
coulson
of
newburgh
has
just
invented
instead
of
teeth
the
jaws
of
the
new
trap
have
pads
of
corrugated
rubber
which
grip
as
tightly
and
effectively
as
the
old
contrivance
without
breaking
the
bones
or
piercing
the
skin
i
trust
these
traps
will
shortly
supersede
the
old
ones
so
that
a
portion
of
the
inevitable
suffering
of
the
furred
denizens
of
our
woods
may
be
dispensed
with
in
a
hunting
country
where
foxes
occasionally
find
their
way
into
vermin
traps
colonel
coulson
invention
should
be
invaluable
instead
of
having
to
be
destroyed
or
being
killed
by
the
hounds
in
covert
owing
to
a
broken
leg
it
is
ten
to
one
that
master
reynard
would
be
released
very
little
the
worse
for
his
temporary
confinement
moreover
as
sir
herbert
maxwell
points
out
dog
owners
will
be
grateful
to
the
inventor
when
their
favourites
accidentally
find
their
way
into
one
of
these
traps
and
are
released
without
smashed
bones
and
bleeding
feet
any
kind
of
trap
is
but
a
diabolical
contrivance
at
best
but
these
humane
patents
are
a
vast
improvement
and
do
the
work
better
than
the
old
as
i
can
testify
having
used
them
from
the
time
sir
herbert
maxwell
first
called
attention
to
them
and
being
quite
satisfied
with
them
badgers
are
almost
as
mysterious
in
their
ways
and
habits
as
the
otter
nobody
believes
there
are
badgers
about
except
those
who
look
for
their
characteristic
tracks
about
the
every
now
and
then
however
a
badger
is
dug
out
or
discovered
in
some
way
in
places
where
they
were
unheard
of
before
we
have
one
here
now
a
few
years
ago
i
saw
a
pack
of
foxhounds
find
a
badger
in
chearsley
spinneys
in
oxfordshire
they
hunted
him
round
and
round
for
about
ten
minutes
i
saw
him
just
in
front
of
the
hounds
a
great
fine
specimen
he
was
too
as
far
as
i
remember
the
hounds
killed
him
in
covert
and
then
went
away
on
the
line
of
a
fox
a
year
or
two
ago
three
fine
young
badgers
were
captured
near
on
the
cotswolds
when
i
was
shown
them
i
was
told
they
would
not
feed
in
confinement
finding
a
large
lobworm
i
picked
it
up
and
gave
it
to
one
of
them
he
ate
it
with
the
utmost
relish
his
brown
and
grey
little
body
shook
with
emotion
when
i
spoke
to
him
kindly
just
as
a
dog
trembles
when
you
pet
him
i
am
not
certain
however
whether
the
badger
trembled
out
of
gratitude
for
the
lobworm
or
out
of
rage
and
disgust
at
being
confined
in
a
cage
badgers
would
make
delightful
pets
if
they
had
a
little
less
nature
as
everybody
knows
has
endowed
them
with
this
quality
to
a
remarkable
degree
they
have
the
power
of
emitting
or
retaining
it
at
their
own
discretion
with
terriers
is
not
an
amusement
which
commends
itself
to
humane
sportsmen
it
is
hard
luck
on
the
terriers
even
more
than
on
the
badger
the
dogs
have
a
very
bad
time
if
they
go
anywhere
near
him
talking
of
terriers
how
endless
are
the
instances
of
superhuman
sagacity
in
dogs
of
all
kinds
i
once
drove
miles
from
a
place
near
guildford
in
surrey
to
windsor
in
the
cart
i
took
with
me
a
little
spaniel
when
i
had
completed
about
half
the
journey
i
put
the
spaniel
down
for
a
run
of
a
few
miles
this
was
all
she
saw
of
the
country
in
windsor
through
some
cause
or
other
i
lost
her
but
when
i
arrived
home
a
day
or
two
afterwards
she
had
arrived
there
before
me
it
should
be
mentioned
that
the
journey
was
not
along
a
but
by
lanes
how
on
earth
she
got
home
first
unless
she
came
back
on
my
scent
then
finding
herself
near
home
took
a
short
cut
across
country
so
as
to
be
there
before
me
it
is
impossible
to
imagine
how
curious
it
is
that
all
animals
seem
to
know
when
sunday
comes
round
fish
and
fowl
are
certainly
much
tamer
on
the
seventh
day
of
the
week
than
on
any
other
we
had
a
terrier
that
would
never
attempt
to
follow
you
when
you
were
going
to
church
so
long
as
you
had
your
sunday
clothes
on
whilst
even
when
he
was
following
you
on
a
week
day
if
you
turned
round
and
said
church
in
a
decisive
tone
he
would
trot
straight
back
to
the
house
as
far
as
we
know
he
had
no
special
training
in
this
respect
this
terrier
who
was
a
rare
one
to
tackle
a
fox
has
on
several
occasions
spent
the
best
part
of
a
week
down
a
rabbit
burrow
when
dug
out
he
seemed
very
little
the
worse
for
his
escapade
though
decidedly
emaciated
in
appearance
poor
little
fellow
he
died
a
painless
death
not
long
ago
from
sheer
old
age
i
was
with
him
at
the
time
and
did
not
even
know
he
was
ill
until
five
minutes
before
he
expired
the
most
obedient
and
faithful
as
well
as
the
bravest
little
dog
in
the
world
he
could
do
anything
but
speak
how
much
we
can
learn
from
these
little
emblems
of
simplicity
gladness
and
love
implicit
obedience
and
boundless
faith
in
those
set
over
us
to
forgive
and
forget
unto
seventy
times
seven
to
give
gold
for
silver
nay
to
sacrifice
all
and
receive
back
nothing
in
return
these
are
some
of
the
lessons
we
may
learn
from
creatures
we
call
dumb
perhaps
they
will
have
their
reward
there
is
room
in
eternity
for
the
souls
of
animals
as
well
as
of
men
there
is
room
for
the
london
after
his
life
of
hardship
and
cruel
sacrifice
there
is
room
for
the
innocent
lamb
that
goes
to
the
slaughter
there
is
room
in
those
realms
of
infinity
for
every
bird
of
the
air
and
every
beast
of
the
field
that
either
the
necessity
that
tyrant
plea
or
the
ignorance
of
man
has
condemned
to
torture
injustice
or
neglect
the
most
delightful
of
all
dogs
are
those
scotch
deerhounds
the
author
of
waverley
loved
so
well
how
timid
and
subdued
are
these
trusty
hounds
on
ordinary
occasions
yet
how
fierce
and
relentless
to
pursue
and
slay
their
natural
quarry
the
antlered
monarch
of
the
glen
once
in
savernake
forest
where
the
yaffels
laugh
all
day
amid
the
great
oak
trees
and
the
beech
avenues
with
their
gothic
foliations
and
lichened
trunks
are
the
finest
in
the
world
a
young
untried
deerhound
of
ours
slipped
away
unobserved
and
killed
a
hind
off
his
own
bat
though
he
had
probably
never
seen
a
deer
before
hereditary
instinct
was
too
strong
and
he
succumbed
to
temptation
yet
he
would
not
harm
a
fox
for
on
another
occasion
when
i
was
out
walking
accompanied
by
this
hound
and
a
the
latter
bolted
a
large
dog
fox
out
of
a
drain
when
the
fox
appeared
the
deerhound
made
after
him
and
in
his
attempt
to
dodge
reynard
was
bowled
over
on
to
his
back
but
directly
he
was
called
the
deerhound
came
back
to
our
heels
apparently
not
considering
the
vulpine
race
fair
game
i
will
not
vouch
for
the
accuracy
of
the
story
but
our
coachman
asserts
that
he
saw
this
deerhound
at
play
with
a
fox
in
our
kitchen
garden
not
a
tame
fox
but
a
wild
one
i
believe
myself
that
this
actually
did
happen
as
the
man
who
witnessed
the
occurrence
is
thoroughly
reliable
there
is
no
dog
more
knowing
and
sagacious
in
his
own
particular
way
than
a
retriever
what
an
immense
addition
to
the
pleasure
of
a
day
in
september
is
the
working
of
one
of
these
delightful
dogs
only
the
other
day
when
i
was
sitting
on
the
lawn
a
retriever
puppy
came
running
up
with
something
in
his
mouth
with
which
he
seemed
very
pleased
he
laid
it
at
my
feet
with
great
care
and
tenderness
and
i
saw
that
it
was
a
young
pheasant
about
a
fortnight
old
it
ran
into
the
house
and
was
rescued
unharmed
a
few
hours
afterwards
by
the
keeper
who
restored
it
to
the
hencoop
from
whence
it
came
one
could
not
be
angry
with
a
dog
that
was
unable
to
resist
the
temptation
to
retrieve
but
yet
would
not
harm
the
bird
in
the
smallest
degree
one
does
not
often
see
teams
of
oxen
ploughing
in
the
fields
nowadays
within
a
radius
of
a
hundred
miles
of
london
town
this
is
becoming
a
rare
spectacle
they
are
still
used
sometimes
in
the
cotswolds
however
though
the
practice
of
using
them
must
soon
die
out
great
slow
lumbering
animals
they
are
but
very
handsome
and
delightful
beasts
to
look
upon
a
team
of
brown
oxen
adds
a
pleasing
feature
to
the
landscape
as
we
come
down
the
steep
ascent
which
leads
to
our
little
hamlet
we
often
wonder
why
some
of
the
cottage
front
doors
are
painted
bright
red
and
some
a
lovely
deep
blue
these
different
colours
add
a
great
deal
of
picturesqueness
to
the
cottages
but
is
it
possible
that
the
owners
have
painted
their
doors
red
and
blue
for
the
sake
of
the
charming
distant
effect
it
gives
these
people
have
wonderfully
good
taste
as
a
rule
the
other
day
we
noticed
that
some
of
the
dreadful
iron
sheeting
which
is
creeping
into
use
in
country
places
had
been
painted
by
a
farmer
a
beautiful
rich
brown
it
gave
quite
a
pretty
effect
to
the
barn
it
adjoined
every
bit
of
colour
is
an
improvement
in
the
rather
upland
scenery
of
the
cotswolds
is
a
very
popular
amusement
among
the
villagers
these
lobsters
abound
in
the
gravelly
reaches
of
the
coln
they
are
caught
at
night
in
small
round
nets
which
are
baited
and
let
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
pools
the
crayfish
crawl
into
the
nets
to
feed
and
are
hauled
up
by
the
dozen
two
men
can
take
a
couple
of
bucketfuls
of
them
on
any
evening
in
september
though
much
esteemed
in
paris
where
they
fetch
a
high
price
as
we
must
confess
they
are
rather
disappointing
when
served
up
the
village
people
however
are
very
fond
of
them
and
tom
peregrine
the
keeper
in
his
quaint
way
describes
them
as
very
good
pickings
for
dessert
as
they
eat
a
large
number
of
very
small
trout
as
well
as
ova
on
the
gravel
crayfish
should
not
be
allowed
to
become
too
numerous
in
a
trout
stream
it
is
difficult
to
understand
in
what
the
great
attraction
of
consists
up
to
yesterday
i
had
never
shot
a
rook
in
my
life
the
accuracy
with
which
some
people
can
kill
rooks
with
a
rifle
is
very
remarkable
i
have
seen
my
brother
knock
down
five
or
six
dozen
without
missing
more
than
one
or
two
birds
the
whole
time
one
would
be
thankful
to
die
such
an
instantaneous
death
as
these
young
rooks
they
seem
to
drop
to
the
shot
without
a
flutter
down
they
come
as
straight
as
a
big
stone
dropped
from
a
high
wall
like
a
lump
of
lead
they
fall
into
the
nettles
they
hardly
ever
move
again
it
is
difficult
work
finding
them
in
the
thick
undergrowth
about
eleven
the
evening
after
shooting
the
young
rooks
i
was
returning
home
from
a
neighbouring
farmhouse
when
i
heard
the
most
lamentable
sounds
coming
from
the
rookery
there
seemed
to
be
a
funeral
service
going
on
in
the
big
ash
trees
muffled
cawings
and
piteous
cries
told
me
that
the
poor
old
rooks
were
mourning
for
their
children
i
can
not
remember
ever
hearing
rooks
cawing
at
that
time
of
night
before
saving
the
lark
that
scorner
of
the
ground
which
rises
and
sings
in
the
skies
an
hour
before
sunrise
the
rooks
are
the
first
birds
to
strike
up
at
early
dawn
one
often
notices
this
fact
on
sleepless
nights
about
on
a
may
morning
a
rook
begins
the
grand
concert
with
a
solo
in
g
flat
then
a
cock
pheasant
crows
or
an
owl
hoots
moorhens
begin
to
stir
and
gradually
the
woodland
orchestra
works
up
to
a
tremendous
burst
of
song
such
as
is
never
heard
at
any
hour
but
that
of
sunrise
now
the
rich
stream
of
music
winds
along
deep
majestic
smooth
and
strong
through
verdant
vales
how
often
one
has
heard
this
grand
thanksgiving
chorus
of
the
birds
at
early
dawn
i
wonder
if
the
poor
rooks
caw
all
night
long
after
the
slaughter
of
the
innocents
they
were
still
at
it
when
i
went
to
bed
at
and
this
was
within
two
hours
of
their
time
of
getting
up
some
say
that
against
that
season
cornea
in
which
our
saviour
birth
is
celebrated
the
bird
of
dawning
singeth
all
night
long
thus
wrote
shakespeare
of
bold
chanticleer
and
perhaps
the
rooks
when
they
are
grieving
for
their
lost
ones
hold
solemn
requiem
until
the
morning
light
and
the
cheering
rays
of
the
sun
make
them
forget
their
woes
it
is
difficult
to
understand
what
pleasure
the
farmers
find
in
shooting
young
rooks
with
guns
ours
are
always
allowed
a
grand
in
the
garden
every
year
they
ask
their
friends
out
from
cirencester
to
assist
for
an
hour
or
so
the
shots
have
been
rattling
all
round
the
house
and
on
the
sheds
in
the
the
horses
are
frightened
out
of
their
wits
men
ought
to
know
better
than
to
keep
firing
continually
towards
a
house
not
two
hundred
yards
away
a
stray
pellet
might
easily
blind
a
man
or
a
horse
farmers
are
sometimes
very
careless
with
their
guns
out
one
is
in
mortal
terror
of
the
man
on
one
right
who
invariably
carries
his
gun
at
such
a
level
that
if
it
went
off
it
would
rake
the
whole
line
if
you
tell
one
of
these
gentry
that
he
is
holding
his
gun
in
a
dangerous
way
he
will
only
laugh
remarking
possibly
that
you
are
getting
very
nervous
the
best
plan
is
not
to
ask
these
but
highly
dangerous
fellows
to
shoot
with
you
unfortunately
it
is
probably
the
eldest
son
of
the
principal
tenant
on
the
manor
who
is
the
culprit
the
best
plan
in
such
cases
is
to
speak
to
the
old
man
firmly
but
courteously
asking
him
to
try
to
dissuade
his
son
from
his
dangerous
practices
it
is
amusing
to
watch
the
jackdaws
when
they
come
from
the
fir
trees
to
steal
the
food
we
throw
every
morning
on
to
the
lawn
in
front
of
the
house
for
the
pheasants
the
pigeons
and
other
birds
they
are
the
funniest
rascals
and
the
biggest
thieves
in
christendom
alighting
suddenly
behind
a
cock
pheasant
they
snatch
the
food
from
him
just
as
he
imagines
he
has
got
it
safely
and
terribly
astonished
he
always
looks
then
these
greedy
daws
will
chase
the
smaller
birds
as
they
fly
away
with
any
dainty
morsel
and
compel
them
to
give
it
up
a
curiously
mixed
group
assembles
on
the
lawn
each
morning
at
eight
in
the
winter
first
of
all
there
are
the
pheasants
crowing
loudly
for
their
breakfast
then
come
the
stately
swans
several
pinioned
wild
ducks
tame
pigeons
and
wild
and
timid
stock
doves
four
or
five
moorhens
any
number
of
daws
as
well
as
thrushes
blackbirds
starlings
and
finches
one
day
having
forgotten
to
feed
them
i
was
astonished
at
hearing
loud
quacks
proceeding
from
the
and
was
horrified
to
find
that
the
ducks
had
come
into
the
house
to
look
for
me
and
demand
their
grub
foxes
give
one
a
good
deal
of
anxiety
in
may
and
june
when
the
cubs
are
about
half
grown
on
arriving
home
the
first
news
i
hear
is
that
two
dead
cubs
have
been
picked
up
one
looks
as
if
his
head
had
been
battered
in
and
the
other
appears
to
have
been
worried
by
a
dog
this
is
the
only
information
i
can
get
from
the
keeper
it
is
really
a
serious
blow
for
if
two
have
been
found
dead
how
many
others
may
not
have
died
in
their
earth
or
in
the
woods
two
seasons
ago
six
dead
cubs
were
picked
up
here
they
had
died
from
eating
rooks
which
had
been
poisoned
by
some
farmers
it
took
us
a
long
time
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
affair
for
no
information
is
to
be
got
out
of
gloucestershire
folk
you
must
ferret
such
matters
out
yourself
there
are
still
live
cubs
in
the
for
i
heard
them
there
this
afternoon
so
there
is
yet
hope
but
twenty
acres
of
covert
will
not
stand
this
sort
of
thing
considering
that
the
hounds
are
through
them
once
in
three
weeks
on
an
average
throughout
the
winter
only
one
vixen
survived
at
the
end
of
last
season
though
another
one
has
turned
up
since
we
have
two
litters
fortunately
where
you
have
coverts
handy
to
a
stream
of
any
kind
there
will
foxes
congregate
they
love
and
moorhens
more
than
any
other
food
a
strange
prejudice
exists
among
hunting
men
against
cleaning
out
artificial
earths
there
was
never
a
greater
fallacy
want
looking
to
from
time
to
time
say
every
ten
years
for
rabbits
will
render
them
practically
useless
by
burrowing
out
in
different
places
a
block
is
often
formed
in
the
drain
by
this
burrowing
and
the
earth
will
have
to
be
opened
and
the
channel
freed
the
best
possible
preventive
measure
against
mange
is
to
clear
out
your
artificial
earths
every
ten
years
as
for
driving
the
foxes
away
by
this
practice
we
can
not
believe
it
you
can
not
keep
foxes
from
using
a
good
artificial
drain
so
long
as
it
lies
dry
and
secluded
and
the
entrance
is
not
too
large
they
prefer
a
small
entrance
as
they
imagine
dogs
can
not
follow
them
into
a
small
hole
a
farmer
made
an
earth
in
a
hedgerow
last
year
right
away
from
any
coverts
and
one
would
have
thought
out
of
the
beaten
track
of
reynard
nightly
prowls
yet
the
foxes
took
to
this
earth
at
the
beginning
of
the
hunting
season
and
they
were
soon
quite
established
there
there
is
no
mystery
about
building
a
reynard
will
take
to
any
dry
underground
place
that
lies
in
a
secluded
spot
if
it
faces
south
that
is
to
say
if
your
earth
runs
in
a
half
circle
with
both
entrances
facing
towards
the
south
or
so
much
the
better
the
entrance
should
not
be
more
than
about
six
inches
square
such
a
hole
looks
uncommonly
small
no
doubt
but
a
fox
prefers
it
to
a
larger
one
about
half
way
through
the
passage
a
little
chamber
should
be
made
to
tempt
a
vixen
to
lay
up
her
cubs
there
when
there
are
lots
of
foxes
and
not
too
many
earths
they
will
very
soon
begin
to
work
a
new
drain
so
long
as
it
lies
in
a
secluded
spot
and
within
easy
distance
of
master
reynard
skirmishing
grounds
we
have
lately
made
such
an
earth
in
a
small
covert
because
the
original
earth
is
the
wrong
side
of
the
river
coln
all
the
good
country
is
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
to
that
on
which
the
old
earth
is
situated
foxes
will
seldom
cross
the
stream
when
they
are
first
found
it
is
hoped
therefore
that
when
they
take
to
the
new
earth
they
will
lie
in
the
wood
on
the
right
side
of
the
stream
we
shall
then
close
the
old
earth
and
thus
endeavour
to
get
the
foxes
to
run
the
good
country
much
may
be
done
to
show
sport
by
using
a
little
strategy
of
this
kind
many
a
good
stretch
of
grass
country
is
lost
to
the
hunt
because
the
earths
are
badly
distributed
it
must
be
remembered
that
a
fox
when
first
found
will
usually
go
straight
to
his
earth
finding
that
closed
he
will
make
for
the
next
earths
he
is
in
the
habit
of
using
the
other
day
while
ferreting
in
the
coverts
previous
to
the
keeper
bolted
a
huge
fox
out
of
one
burrow
and
a
cat
out
of
the
other
he
also
tells
me
that
he
once
found
a
hare
and
a
fox
lying
in
their
forms
within
three
yards
of
one
another
in
a
small
disused
quarry
there
is
no
doubt
that
like
jack
among
fish
the
fox
is
friendly
enough
on
some
days
when
his
belly
is
full
he
then
makes
up
to
rabbits
and
other
animals
with
the
intent
of
turning
on
them
when
they
least
expect
it
without
this
treacherous
sort
of
cunning
reynard
would
often
have
to
go
supperless
to
bed
in
those
drains
and
earths
where
foxes
are
known
to
lie
you
will
often
see
traces
of
rabbits
these
little
conies
are
wonderfully
confiding
in
the
way
they
use
a
it
is
difficult
to
believe
that
they
live
in
the
drain
with
the
foxes
but
they
are
exceedingly
fond
of
making
burrows
with
an
entrance
to
an
earth
they
are
a
great
nuisance
in
spoiling
earths
by
this
practice
rabbits
invariably
establish
themselves
in
which
have
been
temporarily
deserted
foxes
become
very
cute
towards
the
end
of
the
hunting
season
they
can
hear
hounds
running
at
a
distance
of
four
or
five
miles
on
windy
days
knowing
that
the
earths
are
stopped
they
leave
the
bigger
woods
and
hide
themselves
in
fields
and
hedgerows
last
season
a
fox
was
seen
to
leave
our
coverts
trot
along
the
and
ensconce
himself
among
some
laurels
near
the
manor
house
he
was
so
easily
seen
where
he
lay
in
the
shrubbery
that
a
crowd
of
villagers
stood
watching
him
from
the
road
he
knew
the
hounds
would
not
draw
this
place
as
it
is
quite
small
and
bare
so
here
he
stayed
until
dusk
then
having
assured
himself
that
the
hounds
had
gone
home
he
jumped
up
and
trotted
back
to
the
woods
again
a
flock
of
sheep
are
not
always
frightened
at
a
fox
the
other
day
an
old
dog
fox
the
hero
of
many
a
good
run
in
recent
years
from
these
coverts
an
old
customer
in
fact
was
observed
by
the
keeper
and
two
other
men
trying
to
cross
the
river
by
means
of
a
footbridge
a
flock
of
sheep
doubtless
taking
him
for
a
dog
were
frustrating
his
endeavours
to
get
across
directly
he
set
foot
on
dry
land
they
would
bowl
him
over
on
to
his
back
in
the
most
unceremonious
way
this
game
of
romps
went
on
for
about
ten
minutes
finally
the
fox
getting
tired
of
trying
to
pass
the
sheep
trotted
back
over
the
footbridge
fifty
yards
up
stream
a
narrow
fir
pole
is
set
across
the
water
the
cunning
old
rascal
made
for
this
and
attempted
to
get
to
the
other
side
but
the
fates
were
against
him
there
was
a
strong
wind
blowing
at
the
time
so
that
when
he
was
half
way
across
the
pool
he
was
actually
blown
off
sideways
into
the
water
and
a
rare
ducking
he
got
he
gave
the
job
up
after
this
and
trotted
back
into
the
wood
this
is
a
very
curious
occurrence
because
the
fox
was
perfectly
healthy
and
strong
he
is
well
known
throughout
the
country
not
only
for
his
tremendous
cheek
but
also
for
the
wonderful
runs
he
has
given
from
time
to
time
he
will
climb
over
a
wire
fence
to
gain
entrance
to
a
belonging
to
an
excellent
sportsman
who
though
not
a
hunting
man
would
never
allow
a
fox
to
be
killed
he
is
reported
to
have
had
fifty
fowls
out
of
this
place
during
the
last
few
months
when
caught
in
the
act
in
broad
daylight
the
fox
had
to
be
hunted
round
and
round
the
enclosure
before
he
would
leave
finally
climbing
up
the
wire
fencing
like
a
cat
instead
of
departing
by
the
open
door
it
is
very
rare
that
a
mischievous
fox
given
to
the
destruction
of
poultry
is
also
a
one
too
often
these
gentry
know
no
extent
of
country
they
take
refuge
in
the
nearest
farmyard
when
pressed
by
the
hounds
at
the
end
of
a
run
we
have
seen
them
on
the
roof
of
houses
and
outbuildings
time
after
time
on
one
occasion
last
season
a
hunted
fox
was
discovered
among
the
rafters
in
the
roof
of
a
very
high
barn
the
was
sent
up
by
means
of
a
long
ladder
eventually
pulling
him
out
of
his
by
his
brush
poor
brute
perhaps
he
might
have
been
spared
after
showing
such
marvellous
strategy
it
speaks
wonders
for
the
and
unselfishness
of
the
farmer
who
owns
the
above
alluded
to
that
he
never
would
send
in
the
vestige
of
a
claim
to
the
hunt
secretary
for
the
poultry
he
has
lost
from
time
to
time
but
he
is
one
of
the
yeomen
of
gloucestershire
a
gentleman
if
ever
there
was
one
a
type
of
the
best
sort
of
englishman
alas
that
hard
times
have
thinned
the
ranks
of
the
old
yeoman
farmers
of
the
cotswolds
they
are
the
very
backbone
of
the
country
we
can
ill
afford
to
lose
them
with
their
cheery
bluff
manners
and
natures
some
of
the
people
round
about
are
not
so
scrupulous
in
the
way
of
poultry
claims
we
have
had
to
investigate
a
large
number
in
recent
years
it
is
a
difficult
matter
to
distinguish
from
bogus
claims
they
vary
in
amount
from
one
to
twenty
pounds
once
only
have
we
been
foolish
enough
to
rear
a
litter
of
cubs
by
hand
having
obtained
them
from
the
big
woods
at
cirencester
before
the
hunting
season
had
commenced
we
had
received
claims
of
nineteen
and
fourteen
pounds
from
neighbouring
farmers
for
poultry
and
turkeys
destroyed
one
bailiff
declared
that
the
foxes
were
so
bold
they
had
fetched
a
young
heifer
that
had
died
from
the
bowssen
into
the
whether
the
bailiff
put
it
there
or
the
foxes
fetched
it
i
know
not
but
the
white
bleached
skull
may
be
seen
hard
by
the
earth
to
this
day
one
of
the
claimants
above
named
farms
three
hundred
acres
on
strictly
economical
principles
he
has
allowed
the
land
to
go
back
to
grass
and
the
only
labour
he
employs
on
it
is
a
boy
whom
he
pays
in
kind
this
boy
arrived
the
other
day
with
another
poultry
claim
when
the
following
dialogue
occurred
i
see
you
have
got
down
sixteen
young
ducklings
on
the
list
yaas
the
jackdars
fetched
they
how
do
you
know
the
jackdaws
took
them
maister
said
so
do
you
shut
up
your
fowls
at
night
yaas
we
shuts
the
daar
but
the
farxes
gets
in
it
be
all
weared
out
there
be
great
holes
in
the
bowssen
where
they
gets
through
and
fetches
them
how
can
one
pay
poultry
claims
of
this
kind
it
being
absolutely
impossible
to
verify
these
accounts
properly
the
only
way
is
to
take
the
general
character
of
the
claimant
paying
according
as
you
think
him
straightforward
or
the
reverse
it
is
an
insult
to
an
honest
man
to
offer
him
anything
less
than
the
amount
he
asks
for
therefore
claims
which
have
every
appearance
of
being
should
be
settled
in
full
but
the
hunt
ca
afford
it
one
is
told
in
that
case
people
ought
to
subscribe
more
if
men
paid
ten
pounds
for
every
hunter
they
owned
the
income
of
most
establishments
would
be
more
than
doubled
the
farmers
are
wonderfully
on
the
whole
but
they
can
not
be
expected
to
welcome
a
whole
multitude
of
strangers
nor
can
they
allow
large
fields
to
ride
over
their
land
in
these
bad
times
without
compensation
of
some
sort
slowly
but
surely
a
change
is
coming
over
our
ideas
of
hunting
rights
and
hunting
courtesy
and
the
sooner
we
realise
that
we
ought
to
pay
for
our
hunting
on
the
same
scale
as
we
do
for
shooting
and
fishing
the
better
will
it
be
for
all
concerned
talking
of
hunting
and
foxes
reminds
me
that
a
short
time
ago
i
went
to
investigate
an
earth
to
see
if
a
vixen
was
laid
down
there
finding
no
signs
of
any
cubs
i
was
just
going
away
when
i
saw
a
feather
sticking
out
of
the
ground
a
few
yards
from
the
i
pulled
four
young
thrushes
a
tiny
rabbit
and
two
young
out
of
this
hole
and
them
the
cubs
it
afterwards
appeared
were
laid
up
in
a
rabbit
burrow
some
distance
away
but
the
old
vixen
kept
her
larder
near
her
old
quarters
instead
of
burying
her
supplies
for
a
rainy
day
close
to
the
hole
where
she
had
her
cubs
perhaps
she
was
meditating
moving
the
litter
to
this
earth
on
some
future
occasion
i
shall
never
forget
discovering
this
litter
when
looking
down
a
i
heard
a
scuffle
a
young
cub
came
up
to
the
mouth
of
the
hole
saw
me
and
dashed
back
again
into
the
earth
this
was
the
smallest
place
i
ever
saw
cubs
laid
up
in
the
vixen
happened
to
be
a
very
little
one
it
is
amusing
to
watch
the
cubs
playing
in
the
corn
on
a
evening
if
you
go
up
wind
you
can
approach
within
ten
yards
of
them
round
and
round
they
gambol
tumbling
each
other
over
for
all
the
world
like
young
puppies
they
take
little
notice
of
you
at
first
but
after
a
time
they
suddenly
stop
playing
stare
hard
at
you
for
half
a
minute
then
bolt
off
into
the
forest
of
waving
green
wheat
one
word
more
about
the
scent
of
foxes
not
long
ago
a
man
wrote
to
the
saying
that
he
had
proved
by
experiment
that
on
the
saturation
or
relative
humidity
of
the
air
the
hunter
hopes
depend
in
fact
he
announced
that
he
had
solved
the
riddle
of
scent
it
so
happened
that
for
some
years
the
present
writer
had
also
been
amusing
himself
with
experiments
of
the
same
nature
and
at
one
time
entertained
the
hope
that
by
means
of
the
hygrometer
he
would
arrive
at
a
solution
of
the
mystery
but
alas
it
was
not
to
be
on
several
occasions
when
the
air
was
saturated
scent
proved
abominable
that
the
relative
humidity
of
the
air
is
not
the
factor
was
often
proved
by
the
bad
scent
experienced
just
before
rain
and
storms
when
the
hygrometer
showed
a
saturation
of
considerably
over
ninety
per
cent
but
there
are
undoubtedly
other
complications
besides
the
evaporations
from
the
soil
and
the
relative
humidity
of
the
air
to
be
considered
in
making
an
enquiry
into
the
causes
of
good
and
bad
scent
the
amount
of
moisture
in
the
ground
the
state
of
the
soil
in
reference
to
the
question
of
whether
it
carries
or
not
the
temperature
of
the
air
and
last
but
not
by
any
means
least
the
condition
of
the
quarry
be
it
fox
stag
or
hare
are
all
questions
of
vital
importance
complicating
matters
and
preventing
a
solution
of
the
mysteries
of
scent
as
the
atmosphere
is
variable
so
also
must
scent
be
variable
the
two
things
are
inseparably
bound
up
with
one
another
for
this
reason
if
after
a
period
of
rainy
weather
we
have
an
in
the
winter
without
severe
frost
and
an
absence
of
bright
sunny
days
we
can
usually
depend
on
a
scent
instead
of
the
air
rising
there
is
during
an
as
we
all
know
a
tendency
towards
a
gentle
of
air
or
at
all
events
a
steady
pressure
and
this
causes
smoke
whether
from
a
railway
engine
or
a
tobacco
pipe
to
hang
in
the
air
and
scent
to
lie
breast
high
unfortunately
the
normal
state
of
the
atmospheric
fluid
is
a
rushing
in
of
cold
air
and
a
rushing
out
or
upwards
of
warmer
air
causing
unsettled
variable
equilibrium
and
unsettled
variable
scent
the
barometer
would
be
an
absolutely
reliable
guide
for
the
hunting
man
were
it
not
for
the
complications
already
named
above
complications
which
prevent
either
barometer
or
hygrometer
from
offering
infallible
indications
of
good
or
bad
scenting
days
however
scent
often
improves
at
night
when
the
dew
begins
to
form
and
it
may
also
suddenly
improve
at
any
time
of
day
should
the
dew
point
be
reached
owing
to
the
temperature
cooling
to
the
point
of
saturation
this
is
always
liable
to
occur
at
some
time
on
days
on
which
the
hygrometer
shows
us
that
there
is
over
ninety
per
cent
of
moisture
in
the
air
but
here
again
radiation
comes
in
to
complicate
matters
for
clouds
may
check
the
formation
of
dew
it
may
safely
be
said
however
that
other
conditions
being
favourable
a
fast
run
is
likely
to
occur
at
any
time
of
day
should
the
dew
point
be
reached
thus
the
hygrometer
is
worthy
to
be
studied
on
a
hunting
morning
in
may
there
is
a
good
deal
of
to
be
done
on
a
trout
stream
our
plan
is
to
have
a
couple
of
big
field
days
about
may
the
weeds
on
over
two
miles
of
water
are
all
cut
during
that
time
as
they
are
not
allowed
to
be
sent
down
the
stream
we
get
them
out
in
several
different
places
they
are
then
piled
in
heaps
and
left
to
rot
the
operation
is
repeated
at
the
end
of
the
fishing
season
about
a
dozen
scythes
tied
together
are
used
two
men
hold
the
ends
and
walk
up
the
stream
one
on
each
side
of
the
river
mowing
as
they
go
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
management
required
in
if
much
weed
is
left
uncut
the
millers
grumble
if
you
cut
them
bare
there
are
no
homes
left
for
the
fish
the
last
is
the
worse
evil
of
the
two
the
millers
are
usually
men
whilst
poachers
can
commit
fearful
depredations
in
a
small
stream
that
has
been
cut
too
bare
the
way
these
limestone
streams
are
netted
is
as
follows
about
two
in
the
morning
when
there
is
enough
light
to
commence
operations
a
net
is
laid
across
the
stream
and
pegged
down
at
each
end
the
water
is
then
beaten
with
long
sticks
both
above
and
below
the
net
nor
is
it
difficult
to
drive
the
trout
into
the
trap
they
rush
down
and
failing
to
see
any
net
they
soon
become
hopelessly
entangled
in
its
meshes
the
bobbing
corks
intimate
to
the
poachers
that
there
are
some
good
trout
in
the
net
one
end
is
then
unpegged
and
the
haul
is
made
about
ten
trout
would
be
a
good
catch
the
operation
is
repeated
four
or
five
times
until
some
fifty
fish
have
been
bagged
the
poachers
then
depart
taking
care
to
remove
all
signs
of
their
night
work
such
as
scales
of
fish
stray
weeds
and
bits
of
stick
in
by
hand
instead
of
with
the
long
knives
it
is
wonderful
how
many
trout
get
cut
by
the
scythes
there
used
to
be
several
good
fish
killed
this
way
at
each
annual
cutting
when
the
men
used
to
walk
up
the
stream
mowing
as
they
went
one
would
have
thought
trout
would
have
been
able
to
avoid
the
scythes
being
such
quick
slippery
animals
until
the
present
season
otters
have
seldom
visited
our
parts
of
the
coln
unfortunately
however
they
have
turned
up
and
are
committing
sad
havoc
among
the
fish
it
is
such
a
terribly
easy
stream
for
them
to
work
the
water
is
very
shallow
and
the
current
is
a
slow
one
we
are
not
well
up
in
in
these
parts
there
being
no
hounds
within
fifty
miles
i
have
never
seen
an
otter
on
the
coln
but
one
day
at
a
spot
near
which
we
have
noticed
the
billet
of
an
otter
and
some
fishes
heads
i
heard
a
noise
in
the
water
and
a
huge
wave
seemed
to
indicate
that
something
bigger
than
a
coln
trout
was
proceeding
up
stream
close
to
the
bank
all
the
way
on
running
up
of
course
i
saw
nothing
but
half
an
hour
afterwards
i
saw
another
big
wave
of
the
same
kind
it
was
so
close
to
me
that
if
it
had
been
a
fish
or
a
rat
i
must
have
seen
him
i
had
a
terrier
with
me
but
of
course
he
was
unable
to
find
an
otter
a
dog
unbroken
to
the
scent
is
worse
than
useless
on
another
occasion
i
saw
a
running
away
from
some
larger
animal
under
the
opposite
bank
of
the
river
some
bushes
prevented
my
seeing
very
well
but
i
am
almost
certain
it
was
an
otter
a
son
of
the
marshes
mentions
in
one
of
his
charming
books
that
otters
do
kill
i
was
not
aware
of
this
fact
until
i
read
it
in
the
book
called
from
spring
to
fall
the
broad
shallow
reach
of
the
coln
in
front
of
the
manor
house
seems
to
be
a
favourite
of
the
otter
during
his
nocturnal
rambles
for
sometimes
one
is
awakened
at
night
by
a
tremendous
tumult
among
the
wild
duck
and
moorhens
that
haunt
the
pool
they
rush
up
and
down
screaming
and
flapping
their
wings
as
if
they
were
daft
a
few
weeks
after
writing
the
above
we
caught
a
beautiful
female
otter
in
a
trap
weighing
some
seventeen
pounds
i
have
regretted
its
capture
ever
since
great
as
the
number
of
trout
they
eat
undoubtedly
is
i
do
not
intend
to
allow
another
otter
to
be
trapped
unless
they
become
too
numerous
such
lovely
mysterious
creatures
are
becoming
far
too
scarce
nowadays
and
ought
to
be
rigidly
preserved
last
october
we
were
shooting
a
withybed
of
two
acres
on
the
river
bank
when
the
beaters
suddenly
began
shouting
an
otter
an
otter
and
sure
enough
a
large
dog
otter
ran
straight
down
the
line
this
small
withybed
also
contained
three
fine
foxes
and
a
good
sprinkling
of
pheasants
the
number
of
in
the
banks
of
this
stream
seems
to
increase
year
by
year
the
damage
they
do
is
not
great
but
the
millers
and
the
farmers
do
not
like
them
because
with
their
numerous
holes
they
undermine
the
banks
of
the
millpound
and
the
water
finds
its
way
through
them
on
to
the
meadows
country
folk
are
very
fond
of
an
occasional
rat
hunt
they
do
lay
themselves
out
to
be
hunted
so
tremendously
a
rat
will
bolt
out
of
his
hole
dive
half
way
across
the
stream
then
taking
advantage
of
the
tiniest
bit
of
weed
he
will
come
up
to
the
surface
poke
his
nose
out
of
the
water
and
watch
you
intently
an
inexperienced
eye
would
never
detect
him
but
if
a
stone
is
thrown
at
him
finding
his
subterfuge
detected
he
is
apt
to
lose
his
head
either
coming
back
towards
you
and
being
obliged
to
come
up
for
air
before
he
reaches
his
hole
or
else
swimming
boldly
across
to
the
opposite
bank
in
the
latter
case
he
is
safe
tom
peregrine
is
a
great
hand
at
catching
in
a
he
holds
the
net
over
the
hole
which
leads
to
the
water
and
pokes
his
stick
into
the
bank
above
the
rat
bolts
out
into
the
net
and
is
immediately
landed
great
black
brutes
live
in
the
banks
of
the
stream
as
well
as
they
are
very
much
larger
and
less
fascinating
than
the
voles
to
see
one
of
the
latter
species
crossing
the
stream
with
a
long
piece
of
grass
in
his
mouth
is
a
very
pretty
sight
they
are
rodents
and
somewhat
resemble
squirrels

beautifies
the
village
street
for
eight
months
in
the
year
in
may
the
rich
brown
and
gold
of
the
gillyflower
is
seen
on
every
side
and
their
fragrance
is
wafted
far
and
wide
by
every
breeze
that
blows
then
there
is
a
very
pretty
plant
that
covers
some
of
the
cottage
walls
at
this
time
of
year
it
is
the
wistaria
in
the
distance
you
might
take
it
for
lilac
for
the
colours
are
almost
identical
then
come
the
roses
the
beautiful
june
roses
the
breves
of
horace
but
the
roses
of
the
cotswolds
are
not
so
short
lived
for
all
that
horace
has
sung
you
may
see
them
in
the
cottage
gardens
from
the
end
of
may
until
christmas
how
cool
an
old
house
is
in
summer
the
thick
walls
and
the
stone
floors
give
them
an
almost
icy
feeling
in
the
early
morning
even
as
i
write
my
thermometer
stands
at
within
whilst
the
one
out
of
doors
registers
in
the
shade
this
is
the
ideal
temperature
neither
too
hot
nor
too
cold
but
it
is
not
summer
yet
only
the
fickle
month
of
may
tom
peregrine
is
getting
very
anxious
he
meets
me
every
evening
with
the
same
story
of
trout
rising
all
the
way
up
the
stream
and
nobody
trying
to
catch
them
i
can
see
by
his
manner
that
he
disapproves
of
my
muddling
over
books
and
papers
instead
of
trying
to
catch
trout
he
can
not
understand
it
all
meanwhile
one
sometimes
asks
oneself
the
question
which
peregrine
would
also
like
to
propound
only
he
dare
not
why
and
wherefore
do
we
tread
the
perilous
paths
of
literature
instead
of
those
pleasant
paths
by
the
river
and
through
the
wood
the
only
answer
is
this
the
prompts
us
to
do
these
things
even
as
it
prompted
the
men
of
old
time
there
is
a
divinity
that
shapes
our
ends
rough
hew
them
how
we
will
if
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
call
to
any
profession
there
is
a
call
to
that
of
letters
so
with
an
enthusiasm
born
of
inexperience
and
delusive
hope
we
embark
as
in
a
leaky
and
untrustworthy
sailing
ship
built
for
ought
we
know
in
the
eclipse
and
rigged
with
curses
dark
and
at
the
mercy
of
every
chance
breeze
are
wafted
by
the
winds
of
heaven
through
chaos
and
darkness
into
the
boundless
ocean
of
words
and
of
books
when
the
waves
run
high
they
resemble
nothing
so
much
as
lions
with
arched
crests
and
flowing
manes
going
to
and
fro
seeking
whom
they
may
devour
or
savage
dogs
rushing
hither
and
thither
foaming
at
the
mouth
and
when
old
father
neptune
lets
loose
his
hungry
of
criticism
then
look
out
for
squalls
but
again
the
that
still
small
voice
echoing
from
the
shores
of
the
ocean
of
time
whispers
in
our
ear
in
the
morning
sow
thy
seed
and
in
the
evening
withhold
not
thine
hand
for
thou
knowest
not
whether
shall
prosper
either
this
or
that
or
whether
they
both
shall
be
alike
good
so
we
sow
in
weakness
and
in
fear
and
trembling
line
upon
line
line
upon
line
here
a
little
and
there
a
little
sometimes
in
mirth
and
laughter
sometimes
in
tears
let
us
not
ask
to
be
raised
in
power
let
us
resign
all
glory
and
honour
and
power
to
the
ancient
of
days
prime
source
of
the
strength
of
wavering
weak
mankind
rather
let
us
be
thankful
that
by
turning
aside
from
the
clamour
of
the
passing
day
to
tread
the
narrow
paths
of
literature
however
humble
however
obscure
our
lot
may
have
been
we
gained
an
insight
into
the
nobler
destinies
of
the
human
soul
and
learnt
a
lesson
which
might
otherwise
have
been
postponed
until
we
were
hovering
on
the
threshold
of
eternity
in
spite
of
complaints
of
east
winds
and
night
frosts
may
is
the
nicest
month
in
the
year
take
it
all
in
all
in
london
this
is
the
case
even
more
than
in
the
country
the
trees
in
the
parks
have
then
the
real
vivid
green
foliage
of
the
country
there
is
a
freshness
about
everything
in
london
which
only
lasts
through
may
by
june
the
smoke
and
dirt
are
beginning
to
spoil
the
tender
fresh
greenery
of
the
young
leaves
in
the
early
morning
of
may
more
than
an
inch
of
snow
fell
in
the
cotswolds
but
it
was
all
gone
by
eight
in
spite
of
the
weather
may
is
the
brightest
merriest
month
of
all
the
glad
new
year
everything
is
at
its
best
man
can
not
be
morose
and
in
may
the
happy
hills
and
pleasing
shade
must
needs
a
momentary
bliss
bestow
on
the
saddest
of
us
all
look
at
yonder
thoroughbred
colt
grazing
peacefully
in
the
paddock
if
you
had
turned
him
out
a
month
ago
he
would
have
galloped
and
fretted
himself
to
death
but
now
that
the
grass
is
sweet
and
he
is
content
to
nibble
the
young
shoots
all
day
long
what
a
lovely
coat
he
has
now
that
his
winter
garments
are
put
off
there
is
a
picture
of
health
and
symmetry
he
has
just
reached
the
interesting
age
of
four
years
is
dark
chestnut
in
colour
and
sixteen
hands
two
and
a
half
inches
in
height
grazing
out
there
he
does
not
look
anything
like
that
size
horses
always
look
so
much
smaller
than
they
really
are
especially
if
they
are
of
good
shape
and
well
proportioned
alas
how
few
of
them
even
thoroughbreds
have
the
real
make
and
shape
necessary
to
carry
weight
across
country
or
to
win
races
you
do
not
see
many
horses
in
a
lifetime
in
whose
shape
the
critical
eye
can
not
detect
a
fault
we
know
the
good
points
as
well
as
the
bad
of
this
colt
for
we
have
had
him
two
years
deep
sloping
shoulders
are
his
speciality
and
they
cover
a
multitude
of
sins
legs
of
iron
with
large
broad
knees
plenty
of
flat
bone
below
the
knee
and
pasterns
neither
too
long
nor
too
upright
well
ribbed
up
he
is
at
the
same
time
rather
indicative
of
strength
and
power
how
broad
are
his
gaskins
how
well
let
down
he
is
what
great
hocks
he
has
but
alas
i
as
you
view
him
from
behind
you
can
not
help
noticing
that
his
hindlegs
incline
a
little
outwards
even
as
a
cow
do
they
are
not
absolutely
straight
as
they
should
be
then
as
to
his
golden
tail
he
carries
it
well
a
fact
which
adds
twenty
pounds
to
his
value
but
strange
to
say
it
is
not
well
set
on
as
a
thoroughbred
ought
to
be
he
does
not
show
the
quality
he
ought
in
his
hindquarters
still
his
head
neck
and
crest
are
good
though
his
eye
is
not
a
large
one
how
much
is
he
worth
twenty
fifty
a
hundred
or
two
hundred
pounds
who
can
tell
will
he
be
a
charger
a
hunter
or
a
london
carriage
horse
all
depends
how
he
takes
to
jumping
his
height
is
against
him
sixteen
hands
two
and
a
half
inches
is
at
least
two
inches
too
big
for
a
hunter
nevertheless
there
are
always
the
brilliant
exceptions
let
us
hope
he
will
be
the
trump
card
in
the
pack
talking
of
horses
how
admirable
was
that
answer
of
johnson
when
a
lady
asked
him
how
on
earth
he
allowed
himself
to
describe
the
word
in
his
dictionary
as
the
of
a
horse
ignorance
madam
pure
ignorance
was
his
laconic
reply
so
great
a
man
could
well
afford
to
confess
utter
ignorance
of
matters
outside
his
own
sphere
but
how
few
of
mankind
are
ever
willing
to
own
themselves
mistaken
about
any
subject
under
the
sun
unless
it
be
bimetallism
or
some
equally
unfashionable
and
abstruse
though
not
unimportant
problem
of
the
day
what
beautiful
shades
of
colour
are
noticeable
in
the
trees
in
the
early
part
of
may
the
ash
being
so
much
later
than
the
other
trees
remains
a
pale
light
green
and
shows
up
against
the
dark
green
chestnuts
and
the
still
darker
firs
but
what
shall
i
say
of
the
great
spreading
walnut
whose
branches
hang
right
across
the
stream
in
our
garden
in
the
cotswold
valley
about
the
middle
of
may
the
walnut
leaves
resemble
nothing
so
much
as
a
mass
of
virginia
creeper
when
it
is
at
its
best
in
september
beautiful
transparent
leaves
of
gold
intermingled
with
red
glisten
in
the
warm
may
sunshine
the
russet
beauties
of
autumn
combined
with
the
fresh
bright
loveliness
of
early
spring
not
till
the
very
end
of
may
will
this
walnut
tree
be
in
full
leaf
he
is
the
latest
of
all
the
trees
the
young
tender
leaves
scent
almost
as
sweetly
as
the
verbena
in
the
greenhouse
it
is
curious
that
ash
trees
when
they
are
close
to
a
river
hang
their
branches
down
towards
the
water
like
the
weeping
willows
is
this
connected
i
wonder
with
the
strange
attraction
water
has
for
certain
kinds
of
wood
by
which
the
armed
with
a
hazel
wand
is
able
to
divine
the
presence
of
hundreds
of
feet
below
the
surface
of
the
earth
what
this
strange
art
of
rhabdomancy
is
i
know
not
but
the
weeping
ash
in
our
garden
by
the
coln
is
one
of
the
most
beautiful
and
shapely
trees
i
ever
saw
it
will
be
an
evil
day
when
some
cruel
hurricane
hurls
it
to
the
ground
we
have
lost
many
a
fine
tree
in
recent
years
some
through
gales
but
others
alas
i
by
the
hand
of
man
a
few
years
ago
i
discovered
a
spot
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
my
home
which
reminded
me
of
the
beautiful
eton
where
once
my
careless
childhood
stray
a
stranger
yet
to
pain
it
consisted
of
a
few
grass
fields
shut
off
by
high
hedges
and
completely
encircled
by
a
number
of
fine
elm
trees
of
great
age
and
lovely
foliage
at
one
end
a
broad
and
shallow
reach
of
the
coln
completed
the
scene
having
obtained
a
long
lease
of
the
place
i
grubbed
up
the
hedges
turned
three
small
fields
into
one
and
made
a
cricket
ground
in
the
midst
my
object
was
to
imitate
as
far
as
possible
the
upper
club
of
the
eton
i
had
barely
accomplished
the
work
the
cricket
ground
had
just
been
levelled
when
the
landlord
agent
or
more
probably
his
mortgagee
arrived
on
the
scene
accompanied
by
a
blustering
timber
merchant
from
cheltenham
to
my
horror
and
dismay
i
was
informed
that
money
being
very
scarce
they
contemplated
making
a
clean
sweep
of
these
grand
old
elms
on
my
expostulating
they
merely
suggested
that
cutting
down
the
trees
would
be
a
great
improvement
as
the
place
would
be
opened
up
thereby
and
made
healthier
in
the
hope
of
warding
off
the
evil
day
we
offered
to
pay
the
price
of
some
of
the
finest
trees
although
they
could
only
legally
be
bought
for
the
present
proprietor
lifetime
the
contractor
however
rather
than
leave
his
work
of
destruction
incomplete
put
a
ridiculous
price
on
them
he
refused
to
accept
a
larger
sum
than
he
could
ever
have
cleared
by
cutting
them
down
this
is
what
cowper
would
have
stigmatised
as
disclaiming
all
regard
for
mercy
and
the
common
rights
of
man
and
conducting
trade
at
the
sword
point
we
then
resolved
to
buy
the
farm
but
the
stars
in
their
courses
fought
against
us
we
were
unsuccessful
in
our
attempt
to
purchase
the
freehold
and
so
the
contractor
men
came
with
axes
and
saws
and
horses
and
carts
for
days
and
weeks
i
was
haunted
by
that
hideous
nightmare
the
crash
of
groaning
trees
as
they
fell
all
around
soon
to
be
stripped
of
all
their
glorious
beauty
the
cruel
blasphemous
shouts
of
the
men
as
they
made
their
horses
drag
the
huge
dismembered
trunks
across
the
beautifully
levelled
greensward
of
the
cricket
ground
were
positively
ninety
great
elms
did
they
strike
down
a
few
were
left
but
of
these
the
two
finest
came
down
in
the
great
gale
of
march
sic
transit
gloria
mundi
trees
are
like
old
familiar
friends
we
can
not
bear
to
lose
them
every
one
that
falls
reminds
us
of
the
days
that
are
no
more
struck
down
in
all
the
pride
and
beauty
of
their
days
they
remind
us
that
those
who
once
gave
promise
of
fruit
for
manhood
prime
have
passed
from
us
for
ever
gone
home
before
their
time
they
remind
me
that
four
of
my
greatest
friends
at
school
ten
short
years
ago
are
long
since
dead
like
the
trees
felled
by
the
axe
they
were
struck
down
by
the
sickle
of
the
silent
reaper
even
as
the
golden
sheaves
that
are
gathered
into
the
beautiful
barns
other
trees
will
spring
up
and
shade
the
naked
earth
in
the
woods
with
their
mantle
of
green
so
also
others
will
fill
our
places
dressed
in
the
old
light
blue
and
just
as
in
the
woods
fresh
young
saplings
are
daily
springing
up
so
also
the
merry
voices
of
happy
generous
boys
are
ringing
as
i
write
in
the
old
old
courts
and
cloisters
by
the
silvery
thames
their
merry
laughter
is
echoed
by
the
bare
grey
walls
whereon
the
names
of
those
who
have
long
been
dust
are
chiselled
in
rude
handwriting
on
the
mouldering
stone
hundreds
we
knew
have
gone
down
the
fatal
bullet
the
ravaging
fever
the
roaring
torrent
and
the
sad
sea
waves
the
slow
sure
grip
of
consumption
the
fall
at
polo
and
the
iron
hoofs
of
the
favourite
hunter
all
claimed
their
victims
perhaps
this
is
why
we
love
to
linger
in
the
woods
watching
the
rays
of
golden
light
reflected
upon
the
warm
red
earth
listening
to
the
heavenly
voices
of
the
birds
and
the
hopeful
babbling
of
the
brook
those
purple
hills
and
distant
bars
of
gold
in
the
western
sky
at
the
soft
twilight
hour
are
rendered
ever
so
much
more
beautiful
when
we
dimly
view
them
through
a
mist
of
tears
and
now
your
thoughts
are
taken
back
five
short
years
you
are
once
more
staying
with
your
old
eton
friend
and
oxford
comrade
in
his
beautiful
home
in
wales
all
is
joy
and
happiness
in
that
lovely
romantic
home
for
in
six
weeks
time
the
young
squire
the
best
and
most
popular
fellow
in
the
world
is
to
be
married
to
the
fair
daughter
of
a
neighbouring
house
is
it
possible
that
aught
can
happen
in
that
short
time
to
mar
the
heavenly
happiness
of
those
two
twin
souls
alas
for
the
gallant
chivalrous
nature
i
well
might
he
have
cried
with
his
knightly
ancestor
of
the
round
table
me
forethinketh
this
shall
betide
but
god
may
well
foredoe
destiny
he
had
gone
down
to
the
lake
in
the
most
beautiful
and
romantic
part
of
his
lovely
home
taking
with
him
as
was
his
wont
his
and
his
gun
one
shot
was
heard
and
one
only
on
that
afternoon
and
then
all
save
for
the
songs
of
the
birds
and
the
rippling
of
the
deep
waters
of
the
lake
was
wrapped
in
silence
then
followed
the
report
whispered
through
the
party
assembled
to
do
honour
to
the
future
bride
and
bridegroom
that
bill
was
missing
then
came
the
agonising
suspense
and
the
eight
hours
search
throughout
the
long
summer
evening
late
that
night
the
father
found
the
fair
young
form
of
his
boy
in
a
thick
and
tangled
copse
there
it
lay
under
the
silent
stars
the
face
upturned
in
its
last
appeal
to
heaven
and
close
by
lay
the
deadly
which
had
been
the
cause
of
all
the
misery
and
grief
that
followed
solemn
before
us
veiled
the
dark
portal
goal
of
all
mortal
stars
silent
rest
us
graves
under
us
silent
he
had
evidently
pursued
game
or
vermin
of
some
sort
into
the
dense
undergrowth
of
the
wood
and
in
his
haste
had
slipped
and
fallen
over
his
gun
for
the
shot
had
just
grazed
his
heart
who
that
knew
him
will
ever
forget
bill
llewelyn
prince
of

are

through

lesson
which
experience
alone
can
teach
exclaiming
with
the

the

i
returned
and
saw
under

that
the

in

it
may
be

i
hold
it
truth
that
of
the
friends
i
loved
on
earth
the
ones
who
died
in
early
youth
were
those
of
best
and
truest
worth
the
swift
alas
the
race
must
lose
the
battle
goes
against
the
strong
god
wills
it
is
for
us
to
choose
whilst
life
is
given
right
and
wrong
is
not
for
us
to
count
the
cost
of
losing
those
we
most
do
love
he

not

battle
lost
who
wins
a
golden
crown
above
and
oft
beneath
the
shades
of
night
when
tempests
howl
around
these
walls
a
vision
steals
upon
my
sight
a
footstep
on
the
threshold
falls
i
see
once
more
that
graceful
form
once
more
that
honest
hand
grasps
mine
once
more
i
hear
above
the
storm
the
voice
i
know
so
well
is
thine
i
see
again
an
eton
boy
a
gentle
boy
divinely
taught
and
call
to
mind
bow
full
of
joy
in
friendly
rivalry
we
sought
the
then
as
i
yield
to
fancy
dreams
i
see
once
more
the
hero
of
the
cricket
field
the
trusty
friend
of
yore
what
tender
yearnings
fond
regret
these
thoughts
of
early
friendship
bring
none
but
the
heartless
can
forget
summer
days
the
friends
of
spring
now
thoughts
of
oxford
fill
my
mind
my
eton
friend
is
with
me
still
but
changed
from
boy
to
man
yet
kind
and
large
of
heart
and
strong
of
will
and
blythe
and
gay
i
recognise
the
athletic
form
the
comely
face
the
mild
expression
of
the
eyes
the
courtesy
and
grace
once
more
with
patient
skill
we
lure
the
mighty
salmon
from
the
deep
once
more
we
tread
the
boundless
moor
and
wander
up
the
mountain
steep
with
gun
in
hand
we
scour
the
plain
together
climb
the
rocky
ways
regardless
he
of
wind
and
rain
who
loved
to
live
laborious
days
i
see
again
fair
penllergare
those
woods
and
lakes
you
loved
so
well
it
seems
but
yesterday
that
there
i
parted
from
you
who
can
tell
the
reason
thou
art
gone
before
it
is
not
given
to
us
to
know
but
doubtless
thou
wert
needed
more
than
we
who
mourn
thee
here
below
life
noblest
lesson
day
by
day
thy
fair
example
nobly
taught
to
point
the
way
by
which
the
hearts
of
men
are
brought
nearer
to
god
this
was
thy
task
humbly
unknowingly
fulfilled
and
it
were
vain
for
us
to
ask
why
now
thy
voice
is
hushed
and
stilled
o
gallant
spirit
generous
heart
if
thou
lived
in
days
gone
by
thou
have
loved
to
bear
thy
part
in
glorious
deeds
of
chivalry
i
make
no
apology
for
this
digression
nor
for
unearthing
from
the
bottom
of
my
drawer
lines
that
written
years
ago
were
never
penned
with
any
idea
of
publication
for
was
not
the
subject
of
those
verses
himself
half
a
cotswold
man
but
now
to
return
once
more
to
the
trees
the
loss
of
which
caused
me
to
digress
some
pages
back
there
are
compensations
in
all
things
not
every
one
who
becomes
a
sojourner
among
the
cotswold
hills
is
fated
to
undergo
such
a
trial
as
the
loss
of
these
ninety
elms
and
notwithstanding
this
severe
lesson
i
am
still
glad
that
i
alighted
on
the
spot
from
which
i
am
now
writing
i
have
learnt
to
find
pleasure
in
other
directions
now
that
my
eton
have
passed
away
for
ever
i
have
become
infected
by
the
spirit
of
the
downs
i
love
the
pure
bracing
air
and
the
boundless
sense
of
space
in
the
open
hills
as
much
as
i
ever
loved
the
more
concentrated
charms
of
the
valley
and
even
in
the
valley
i
have
possessions
of
which
no
living
man
is
able
to
deprive
me
from
my
window
i
can
see
the
silvery
trout
stream
which
after
thousands
of
years
of
restless
activity
is
still
slowly
gliding
down
towards
the
sea
i
can
listen
on
summer
nights
to
the
murmuring
waterfall
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
the
hooting
of
the
owls
and
the
other
sounds
which
break
the
awful
silence
of
the
night
nor
can
the
hand
of
man
disturb
the
glorious
timber
round
the
house
for
it
is
ornamental
and
therefore
safe
from
the
hands
of
the
despoiler
storms
are
gradually
levelling
the
ancient
beech
and
ash
trees
in
the
woods
but
it
will
be
many
a
long
day
before
the
hand
of
nature
has
marred
the
beauty
of
what
has
always
seemed
to
me
to
be
one
of
the
fairest

summer
days
on
the
cotswolds
what
more
felicitie
can
fall
to
creature
than
to
enjoy
delight
with
libertie
and
to
be
lord
of
all
the
workes
of
nature
spenser
the
finest
days
when
the
trees
are
greenest
the
sky
bluest
and
the
clouds
most
snowy
white
are
the
days
that
come
in
the
midst
of
bad
weather
and
just
as
there
is
no
rest
without
toil
no
peace
without
war
no
true
joy
in
life
without
grief
no
enjoyment
for
the
so
there
can
be
no
lovely
summer
days
without
previous
storms
and
rain
no
sunshine
till
the
tearful
mists
have
passed
away
there
had
been
a
week
incessant
rain
every
wild
flower
and
every
blade
of
green
grass
was
soaked
with
moisture
until
it
could
no
longer
bear
its
load
and
drooped
to
earth
in
sheer
dismay
but
last
night
there
came
a
change
the
sun
went
down
beyond
the
purple
hills
like
a
ball
of
fire
eastwards
the
woods
were
painted
with
a
reddish
glow
and
life
and
colour
returned
to
everything
that
grows
on
the
face
of
this
beautiful
earth
it
seems
a
day
i
speak
of
one
from
many
singled
out
one
of
those
heavenly
days
which
can
not
die
wordsworth
so
it
is
pleasant
to
wander
over
the
fields
across
the
crisp
stubbles
where
the
thistledown
is
crowding
in
the
stooks
of
black
oats
past
stretches
of
uncut
corn
looking
red
and
ripe
under
a
burning
sun
white
oxeye
daisies
in
masses
and
groups
thistles
and
bright
scarlet
poppies
grow
in
profusion
among
the
tall
wheat
stalks
a
covey
of
partridges
about
three
parts
grown
rise
almost
at
our
feet
for
it
is
early
august
and
the
deadly
has
not
yet
wrought
havoc
among
the
birds
on
the
right
is
a
field
of
green
turnips
well
grown
after
the
recent
rains
and
promising
plenty
of
cover
for
sportsmen
in
september
in
the
hedgerow
the
lovely
harebells
have
recovered
from
the
soaking
they
endured
and
their
flowers
of
perfect
blue
peep
out
everywhere
the
sweetest
flower
that
grows
up
the
hedgeside
is
the
blue
geranium
or
meadow
the
humble
yarrow
purple
knapweed
field
scabious
thistles
with
bright
purple
heads
and
john
wort
with
its
stars
of
burnished
gold
and
its
pellucid
veins
form
a
natural
border
along
the
hedge
where
wild
clematis
or
traveller
joy
entwines
its
rough
leaf
stalks
round
the
young
hazel
branches
and
among
the
pink
roses
of
the
bramble
by
the
roadside
where
the
dust
blew
before
the
rain
and
covered
every
green
leaf
with
a
coating
of
rich
lime
there
grow
small
shrubs
of
mallow
with
large
flowers
of
pale
purple
or
mauve
here
too
yellow
bedstraw
and
lotus
add
their
tinge
of
gold
to
the
lush
green
grass
and
the
smaller
bindweed
the
lovely
convolvulus
springs
up
on
the
barrenest
spots
even
creeping
over
the
stone
heaps
that
were
left
over
from
last
winter
road
mending
many
another
species
of
wild
flower
which
born
to
blush
unseen
and
waste
its
sweetness
on
the
desert
air
grows
in
the
quiet
cotswold
lanes
might
here
be
named
but
even
though
at
times
one
may
feel
with
wordsworth
to
me
the
meanest
flower
that
blows
can
give
thoughts
that
do
often
lie
too
deep
for
tears
i
will
leave
the
humble
wayside
plants
and
descend
into
the
vale
for
it
is
along
the
back
brook
that
the
tallest
and
stateliest
wild
flowers
may
best
be
seen
the
scythes
mowed
them
all
down
in
may
and
again
in
july
in
the
broad
millpound
so
that
they
do
not
grow
so
tall
by
the
main
stream
but
the
back
brook
the
natural
course
of
the
river
before
the
mills
were
made
was
left
unmolested
by
the
mowers
and
is
a
mass
of
life
and
colour
here
grows
the
graceful
fair
and
tall
and
white
and
fragrant
here
the
glorious
with
pink
blossoms
rears
its
head
high
above
your
shoulders
among
the
and
the
green
rushes
and
segs
the
whole
bank
is
a
medley
of
white
pink
and
lilac
heads
of
mint
all
jumbled
up
together
never
was
such
a
delightful
confusion
of
colour
great
dock
leaves
two
feet
wide
clothe
the
path
by
the
with
all
the
splendour
of
malachite
the
breeze
blows
up
stream
and
the
trout
are
rising
incessantly
taking
something
small
they
will
not
look
at
any
artificial
fly
even
in
the
rippling
breeze
there
is
nothing
small
enough
in
any
to
catch
them
this
afternoon
but
when
the
sun
gets
low
and
the
great
brown
moths
come
out
and
flutter
over
the
water
the
red
palmer
will
catch
a
dish
of
fish
willow
trees
withies
they
call
them
hereabouts
grow
along
the
so
white
are
the
backs
of
their
oval
leaves
that
when
the
breeze
turns
them
back
the
woods
by
the
river
look
bright
and
silvery
when
the
breeze
has
almost
died
away
only
the
tops
of
the
willows
will
be
silvered
the
next
day
if
all
be
calm
and
still
all
will
be
green
as
emerald
such
infinite
variety
is
there
in
the
woods
not
only
do
the
tints
change
month
by
month
but
day
by
day
the
colour
varies
so
that
there
is
always
something
new
some
fresh
effect
of
light
and
shade
to
delight
the
eye
of
man
in
the
quiet
english
country
dotted
about
in
the
midst
of
the
stream
are
little
islands
of
the
lovely
light
blue
is
reflected
everywhere
in
the
water
very
beautiful
are
the
both
on
the
banks
among
the
rushes
and
scattered
about
in
mid
stream
the
meadows
are
full
of
life
there
are
sounds
sweet
to
the
ear
and
sights
pleasing
to
the
eye
in
the
grasshoppers
such
hosts
of
them
that
they
could
never
be
numbered
for
multitude
are
chirping
and
dancing
merrily
they
make
the
field
ring
with
their
importunate
chink
whilst
the
great
cattle
chew
the
cud
and
are
silent
how
like
the
great
and
little
of
mankind
as
edmund
burke
said
years
ago
by
catching
one
of
these
meagre
hopping
insects
of
the
hour
you
will
see
that
their
backs
are
green
as
emerald
and
their
bellies
gold
some
have
a
touch
of
purple
over
the
eyes
their
thighs
which
are
enormously
developed
for
jumping
purposes
have
likewise
a
delicate
tinge
of
purple
contrary
to
the
saying
of
izaak
walton
the
trout
do
not
seem
to
care
much
for
grasshoppers
nowadays
although
perhaps
they
may
relish
them
in
streams
where
food
is
less
plentiful
our
trout
even
prefer
the
tiny
yellow
frogs
that
are
to
be
found
in
scores
by
the
in
early
august
we
have
often
offered
them
both
in
the
deep
pill
below
the
garden
and
though
they
would
come
with
a
dart
and
take
the
little
frog
they
merely
looked
at
the
grasshopper
in
astonishment
and
seldom
took
one
as
we
stand
on
the
rustic
bridge
above
the
pill
gazing
down
into
the
smooth
flowing
water
dark
trout
glide
out
of
sight
into
their
homes
in
the
stonework
under
the
hatch
these
are
the
fish
that
rise
not
to
the
fly
but
prey
on
their
grandchildren
growing
darker
and
lankier
and
every
year
wherever
you
find
a
deep
hole
and
an
ancient
hatchway
there
you
will
also
find
these
great
black
trout
always
lying
in
a
spot
more
or
less
inaccessible
to
the
angler
and
living
for
years
until
they
die
a
natural
death
was
ever
a
place
so
full
of
fish
as
this
pill
looking
down
into
the
deeper
water
where
the
great
iron
hooks
are
set
to
catch
the
nets
i
could
see
dozens
of
trout
of
all
sizes
but
mostly
small
at
the
tail
of
the
pool
are
lots
of
small
ones
rising
with
a
gentle
dimple
as
the
days
became
hotter
and
the
stream
ran
down
lower
and
lower
the
trout
left
the
long
shallow
reaches
and
assembled
here
where
there
is
plenty
of
water
and
plenty
of
food
standing
on
the
bridge
by
the
ancient
spiked
gate
bristling
with
sharp
barbs
of
iron
like
rusty
spear
and
our
ancestors
loved
to
protect
their
privacy
with
these
terrible
barriers
i
listened
to
the
waterfall
three
hundred
yards
higher
up
with
its
ceaseless
music
the
afternoon
sun
was
sparkling
on
the
dimpling
water
which
runs
swiftly
here
over
a
shallow
reach
of
gravel
the
favourite
of
the
trout
there
is
no
peep
of
river
scenery
i
like
so
much
as
this
thirty
yards
up
stream
a
shapely
ash
tree
hangs
its
branches
clothed
with
narrow
sprays
right
across
the
brook
the
fantastic
foliage
almost
touching
the
water
a
little
higher
up
some
willows
and
an
elm
overhang
from
the
other
side
there
is
something
unspeakably
striking
about
a
country
lane
or
a
shallow
rippling
brook
overarched
with
a
tracery
of
fretted
foliage
like
the
roof
of
an
old
gothic
building
who
that
has
ever
visited
the
village
of
stoke
poges
in
buckinghamshire
will
forget
the
lane
by
which
he
approached
the
home
and
last
of
the
poet
gray
perhaps
you
came
from
eton
and
after
passing
along
a
lane
that
is
completely
overhung
with
an
avenue
of
splendid
trees
where
the
thrushes
sing
among
the
branches
as
they
sing
nowhere
else
in
that
neighbourhood
you
turned
in
at
a
little
rustic
gate
straight
in
front
of
your
eyes
were
very
legibly
written
on
grey
stone
three
of
the
finest
verses
of
the
elegy
the
monument
itself
is
plain
not
to
say
hideous
but
the
simple
words
inscribed
thereon
are
unspeakably
grand
when
read
amongst
the
surroundings
of
wood
and
rugged
elm
and
shade
unchanged
as
they
are
after
the
lapse
of
a
century
and
a
half
the
place
and
more
especially
the
lane
is
a
fitting
abode
for
the
spirit
of
the
poet
one
could
almost
hear
the
song
of
him
who
being
dead
yet
speaketh
and
the
birds
in
the
sunshine
above
mingled
their
notes
therewith
like
voices
of
spirits
departed
longfellow
gray
is
a
poet
for
whom
in
common
with
most
englishmen
the
present
writer
has
a
sincere
respect
it
has
been
said
however
of
the
elegy
by
one
critic
that
the
subject
of
the
poem
gives
it
an
unmerited
popularity
and
by
another
and
that
quite
recently
that
it
is
the
mark
of
mediocrity
although
gray
own
modest
dictum
was
the
foundation
of
the
first
of
these
harsh
criticisms
we
are
unable
to
allow
the
truth
of
the
one
and
must
strongly
protest
against
the
other
it
has
been
reported
that
wolfe
the
celebrated
general
after
reciting
the
elegy
on
the
eve
of
the
assault
on
quebec
declared
that
he
would
sooner
have
written
such
a
poem
than
win
a
victory
over
the
french
this
was
nearly
a
century
and
a
half
ago
yet
after
so
long
a
lapse
of
time
the
verses
still
retain
their
hold
on
the
minds
of
all
classes
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
matthew
arnold
and
other
admirers
have
declared
that
the
elegy
was
not
gray
masterpiece
yet
it
was
this
poem
that
brought
a
man
who
accomplished
but
a
small
amount
of
work
into
such
lasting
fame
from
beginning
to
end
as
professor
raleigh
says
of
milton
work
the
elegy
is
crowded
with
examples
of
felicitous
and
exquisite
meaning
given
to
the
infallible
word
was
ever
a
poem
more
frequently
quoted
or
so
universally
plagiarised
in
writing
or
speaking
about
the
country
and
its
inhabitants
if
we
would
express
ourselves
as
concisely
as
we
possibly
can
we
are
bound
to
quote
the
elegy
it
is
invariably
the
shortest
road
to
a
terse
expression
of
our
meaning
who
can
improve
on
far
from
the
madding
crowd
ignoble
strife
or
the
short
and
simple
annals
of
the
poor
if
gray
elegy
is
but
a
mosaic
of
the
felicities
of
those
who
went
before
let
it
be
remembered
that
had
he
not
laboriously
pieced
together
that
mosaic
these
felicities
would
have
been
a
sealed
book
to
the
majority
of
englishmen
not
one
man
in
a
hundred
now
reads
some
of
the
authors
from
which
they
were
culled
and
as
landor
said
of
shakespeare
he
is
more
original
than
his
originals
even
that
strange
individual
samuel
johnson
who
was
accustomed
whenever
gray
poetry
was
mentioned
either
to
crab
it
directly
or
damn
it
with
faint
praise
towards
the
end
of
his
career
admitted
in
his
lives
of
the
poets
that
the
churchyard
abounds
with
images
which
find
a
mirror
in
every
mind
and
with
sentiments
to
which
every
bosom
returns
an
echo
but
the
chief
value
of
the
work
seems
really
to
lie
in
this
it
has
dignified
the
rural
scenes
and
the
honest
rustics
of
england
it
has
invested
every
swain
every
busy
housewife
and
every
little
churchyard
in
the
country
with
a
special
dignity
and
a
lasting
charm
the
traveller
can
not
look
upon
these
scenes
and
faces
without
unconsciously
connecting
them
with
the
lines
he
knows
so
well
gray
elegy
will
never
be
forgotten
for
it
has
struck
its
roots
deep
in
the
national
language
and
far
down
into
the
national
heart
very
similar
to
the
quiet
and
leafy
lane
at
stoke
poges
is
the
brook
below
the
waterfall
at
a
in
the
cotswolds
on
your
left
as
you
look
up
stream
from
the
bridge
of
the
pill
a
gravel
path
runs
alongside
the
water
under
a
hanging
wood
of
leafy
elms
and
beech
trees
where
the
ringdoves
coo
all
day
a
tangled
hedge
filled
with
tall
timber
trees
runs
up
the
bank
here
the
great
convolvulus
queen
of
wild
flowers
twists
her
bines
among
the
hedge
the
flowers
are
conspicuous
everywhere
large
and
as
the
arum
so
luxuriant
is
the
growth
of
wild
flowers
by
the
a
silver
stream
is
the
coln
hereabouts
the
abode
of
fairies
and
fawns
and
nymphs
and
dryads
but
when
the
afternoon
sun
shines
upon
it
it
becomes
a
stream
of
diamonds
set
in
banks
of
emeralds
with
an
arched
and
groined
roof
of
jasper
carved
with
foliations
of
graceful
ash
and
willow
and
over
all
a
sky
of
sapphire
sprinkled
with
clouds
of
pearl
and
opal
later
on
towards
evening
there
will
be
floods
of
golden
light
on
the
grass
and
on
the
beech
trees
up
the
eastern
slope
of
the
valley
and
on
the
bare
red
earth
under
the
trees
red
with
fifty
years
beech
nuts
and
later
still
when
the
distant
hills
are
dyed
as
if
with
archil
the
sapphire
sky
will
be
striped
with
bars
of
gold
and
dotted
with
coals
of
fire
rubies
and
garnets
sardonyx
and
chrysolite
will
all
be
there
and
the
bluish
green
of
beryl
the
western
sky
as
varied
as
felspar
and
changing
colour
as
quickly
as
the
chameleon
and
as
the
day
declines
the
last
beams
of
the
setting
sun
will
find
their
way
through
the
tracery
of
foliage
that
overhangs
the
brook
and
the
waters
will
be
tinged
with
a
rosy
glow
even
as
in
some
ancestral
hall
or
gothic
cathedral
the
sun
at
eventide
pours
through
the
blazoned
windows
and
floods
the
interior
with
rays
of
soft
mysterious
coloured
light
i
have
been
trying
to
describe
one
of
the
loveliest
bits
of
miniature
scenery
on
earth
yet
how
commonplace
it
all
reads
not
a
thousandth
part
of
the
beauty
of
this
spot
at
sunset
is
here
set
down
yet
little
more
can
be
said
how
bitter
to
think
that
the
true
beauty
of
the
trees
the
path
by
the
brook
and
the
sunlight
on
the
water
can
not
be
passed
on
for
others
to
enjoy
can
not
be
stamped
on
paper
but
must
be
seen
to
be
realised
truly
as
richard
jefferies
says
somewhere
there
is
a
layer
of
thought
in
the
human
brain
for
which
there
are
no
words
in
any
language
we
can
not
express
a
thousandth
part
of
the
beauty
of
the
woods
and
the
stream
we
can
but
dimly
feel
it
when
we
see
it
with
our
eyes
below
the
pill
for
we
have
been
gazing
up
stream
some
sheep
are
lying
under
a
gnarled
willow
on
the
left
bank
some
are
nibbling
at
the
lichen
and
moss
on
the
trunk
others
are
standing
about
in
pretty
groups
of
three
and
four
one
of
them
has
just
had
a
ducking
trying
to
get
a
drink
of
water
he
overbalanced
himself
and
fell
in
he
walks
about
shaking
himself
and
doubtless
feels
very
uncomfortable
sheep
do
not
care
much
for
bathing
in
cold
water
you
have
only
to
see
the
in
the
spring
to
realise
how
they
dislike
it
there
is
a
place
higher
up
the
stream
called
the
washpool
where
every
day
in
may
you
can
watch
the
men
bundling
the
poor
old
sheep
into
the
water
one
after
the
other
and
dipping
them
well
to
free
the
wool
from
insects
of
all
kinds
and
how
the
trout
enjoy
the
ticks
that
come
from
their
thickly
matted
coats
one
poor
sheep
is
hopping
about
on
the
cricket
field
dead
lame
perhaps
that
leg
he
drags
behind
is
broken
why
does
not
the
farmer
kill
the
poor
brute
there
is
much
misery
of
this
kind
caused
in
country
places
by
the
thoughtlessness
of
farmers
how
much
has
yet
to
be
learnt
by
the
very
men
who
love
to
describe
the
labourers
as
them
ignorant
lower
classes
alas
that
these
things
can
happen
among
the
green
fields
and
spreading
elms
and
the
heavenly
sunshine
of
summer
days
we
should
have
more
moral
courage
and
do
as
carlyle
bids
us
in
his
old
solemn
way
but
above
all
where
thou
findest
ignorance
stupidity
attack
it
i
say
smite
it
wisely
unwearily
and
rest
not
while
thou
livest
and
it
lives
but
smite
smite
in
the
name
of
god
the
highest
god
as
i
understand
it
does
audibly
so
command
thee
still
audibly
if
thou
hast
ears
to
hear
on
the
cricket
pitch
a
bare
hundred
yards
away
from
the
river
bank
is
a
plentiful
crop
of
dandelions
clover
and
worst
of
all
enormous
plantains
a
gravel
soil
is
very
favourable
to
plantains
for
stones
work
up
and
the
grass
dies
the
dreadful
plantain
seems
to
thrive
anywhere
and
everywhere
and
on
bare
spots
where
grass
can
not
live
he
immediately
appears
rabbits
have
been
making
holes
all
over
the
pitch
and
red
spikes
of
sorrel
wonderfully
rich
and
varied
in
colour
rise
everywhere
at
the
lower
end
of
the
field
towards
the
river
the
cricket
ground
has
been
somewhat
neglected
of
late
there
is
a
great
elm
tree
down
close
to
the
ground
the
only
tree
that
the
winter
gales
had
left
to
shade
us
on
hot
summer
days
it
came
down
suddenly
without
the
slightest
warning
and
underneath
it
that
most
careless
of
all
keepers
tom
peregrine
had
left
the
large
and
the
roller
so
careless
are
some
of
these
gloucestershire
folk
that
sooner
than
do
as
i
had
ordered
and
put
the
in
the
barn
hard
by
they
must
leave
it
in
the
open
air
and
under
this
tree
down
came
my
last
beloved
elm
smashing
the
and
putting
an
end
to
all
thoughts
of
cricket
here
this
summer
it
will
be
ages
before
the
village
carpenter
will
come
with
his
timber
cart
and
draw
the
tree
away
a
gloucestershire
man
can
not
do
a
job
like
this
in
under
two
years
they
are
always
so
busy
you
see
in
gloucestershire
never
a
moment
to
spare
to
get
anything
done
there
was
a
time
when
the
chief
delight
of
summer
lay
in
playing
cricket
what
ecstasy
it
was
to
be
well
set
and
scoring
fast
on
the
ground
the
harder
the
better
cutting
to
the
boundary
when
the
ball
pitched
short
on
the
off
and
driving
her
hard
along
the
ground
when
they
pitched
one
up
what
could
surpass
the
joy
of
scoring
a
century
in
those
long
summer
days
now
we
would
as
soon
spend
the
holidays
in
the
woods
and
by
the
busy
trout
stream
reading
and
taking
note
of
the
trees
and
the
birds
and
the
rippling
of
the
waters
as
they
flow
onwards
ever
onwards
towards
the
sea
there
comes
a
time
to
all
men
sooner
or
later
when
we
say
to
ourselves
bono
in
a
few
short
years
i
shall
no
longer
be
able
to
hit
the
ball
so
hard
and
in
the
field
i
am
already
becoming
a
trifle
slow
then
do
we
take
to
ourselves
pursuits
that
we
can
follow
until
the
limbs
are
stiffened
with
age
and
the
hair
is
white
as
snow
having
spent
the
best
years
of
life
in
the
pursuit
of
pleasures
that
however
engrossing
nevertheless
bore
no
real
and
lasting
fruit
we
finally
fall
back
on
interests
that
will
last
a
lifetime
perhaps
an
eternity
for
who
knows
how
much
of
knowledge
we
shall
take
with
us
to
another
world
aristotle
was
not
far
wrong
when
he
described
earthly
happiness
as
a
life
of
contemplation
with
a
moderate
equipment
of
external
good
fortune
and
prosperity
there
is
no
book
so
well
worthy
to
be
studied
as
the
book
of
nature
no
melodies
like
those
of
the
field
and
fallow
wood
and
wold
and
the
still
small
voice
of
the
busy
streams
labouring
patiently
onwards
day
by
day
in
the
fields
beyond
the
river
haymakers
are
busy
with
the
second
crop
down
to
the
ford
comes
a
great
yellow
drawn
by
two
strong
horses
tandem
fashion
one
small
boy
alone
is
leading
the
big
horses
arriving
at
the
ford
he
jumps
on
to
the
leader
back
and
rides
him
through
the
horses
strain
and
scaut
and
the
cart
bumps
over
the
deep
ruts
nearly
upsetting
luckily
there
is
no
accident
so
much
is
entrusted
to
these
little
farm
lads
of
scarce
fifteen
years
of
age
it
is
a
wonder
they
do
the
work
so
well
from
the
tops
of
the
firs
comes
the
sound
of
pigeons
winging
their
way
from
the
grove
to
the
conygers
the
latter
word
means
the
place
of
rabbits
there
are
lots
of
woods
so
called
in
gloucestershire
it
is
a
curious
piping
sound
that
make
and
not
seeing
the
birds
you
might
think
it
came
from
the
throat
instead
of
the
wings
one
day
two
of
us
were
looking
at
a
flying
over
when
we
observed
something
drop
from
the
skies
and
fall
into
the
stream
on
going
up
we
saw
that
it
was
an
egg
she
had
dropped
there
it
lay
at
the
bottom
of
the
brook
apparently
unbroken
by
the
fall
floating
on
the
soft
south
wind
a
heron
flies
over
so
quietly
that
unless
he
had
given
one
of
his
characteristic
croaks
it
was
a
hundred
to
one
you
did
not
see
him
pass
many
a
heron
and
wild
duck
must
pass
over
us
unobserved
on
windy
days
it
is
so
difficult
to
observe
when
you
are
thinking
a
man
absorbed
in
reverie
can
not
see
half
the
things
that
many
country
folk
with
less
active
brains
never
fail
to
observe
when
we
find
people
who
live
in
the
country
unversed
in
the
ways
of
birds
the
knowledge
of
flowers
and
trees
and
the
habits
of
the
simple
country
folk
we
need
not
necessarily
conclude
that
they
are
dull
and
the
reverse
is
often
the
case
a
man
absorbed
in
business
or
serious
affairs
may
love
the
country
and
yet
know
little
of
its
real
life
a
good
deal
of
time
must
be
spent
in
acquiring
this
kind
of
knowledge
and
it
is
not
everybody
who
has
the
time
or
the
opportunity
to
do
it
if
we
come
across
a
man
with
plenty
of
leisure
yet
knowing
nothing
of
what
is
going
on
around
him
we
may
then
perhaps
have
cause
to
complain
of
his
dulness
aubrey
de
vere
relates
an
amusing
story
about
sir
william
rowan
hamilton
which
exactly
illustrates
my
meaning
when
he
had
soared
into
a
high
region
of
speculative
thought
he
took
no
note
of
objects
close
by
a
few
days
after
our
first
meeting
we
walked
together
on
a
road
a
part
of
which
was
overflowed
by
a
river
at
its
side
our
theme
was
the
transcendental
philosophy
of
which
he
was
a
great
admirer
i
felt
sure
that
he
would
not
observe
the
flood
and
made
no
remark
on
it
we
walked
straight
on
till
the
water
was
half
way
up
to
our
knees
at
last
he
exclaimed
this
we
seem
to
be
walking
through
a
river
had
we
not
better
return
to
the
dry
land
there
is
a
spot
in
the
woods
by
the
river
coln
that
is
almost
untrodden
by
man
it
is
the
favourite
resort
of
foxes
nobody
but
myself
and
the
has
been
there
for
years
and
years
save
that
when
the
hounds
come
the
huntsman
rides
through
and
cheers
the
pack
it
is
in
the
conyger
wood
no
path
leads
through
its
quiet
recesses
where
ash
and
elm
and
larch
and
spruce
mostly
are
mingled
together
with
a
thick
growth
of
elder
spread
beneath
them
it
was
here
in
an
ancient
disused
quarry
that
the
keeper
pointed
out
not
long
since
the
secret
of
the
kingfishers
a
small
crevice
in
the
limestone
rock
from
which
a
disagreeable
smell
of
dried
fish
bones
issued
forth
formed
the
outer
entrance
to
the
nest
one
could
not
see
the
delicate
structure
itself
for
it
appeared
to
be
several
feet
within
the
rock
a
mass
of
powdered
fish
bones
and
the
pungent
odour
from
within
were
all
the
outward
signs
of
the
inner
nest
by
standing
on
a
jutting
ledge
of
the
soft
cretaceous
rock
and
holding
on
by
another
ledge
which
appeared
not
unlikely
to
come
down
and
crush
you
one
could
peep
into
the
hole
and
comfort
oneself
with
the
thought
that
one
was
nearer
a
kingfisher
nest
than
is
usually
vouchsafed
to
mortal
man
it
would
be
easy
to
get
ladder
and
pickaxe
and
break
open
the
rock
until
the
nest
was
reached
but
why
disturb
these
lovely
birds
they
have
built
here
year
by
year
for
centuries
even
now
some
of
this
year
brood
may
be
seen
among
the
willows
by
the
back
brook
from
this
quarry
was
dug
in
the
year
the
stone
to
build
the
old
manor
house
yonder
a
few
miles
away
toward
burford
is
the
quarry
from
which
men
say
christopher
wren
brought
some
of
the
stone
to
raise
paul
cathedral
yet
the
local
people
do
not
care
a
bit
for
this
beautiful
freestone
of
the
cotswold
hills
they
want
to
bring
granite
from
afar
for
their
village
crosses
and
ugly
blue
slates
for
the
roofs
of
the
houses
at
a
parish
council
meeting
the
other
day
it
was
seriously
proposed
to
erect
a
jubilee
hall
of
brick
in
our
village
anything
for
a
change
you
see
these
people
would
not
be
mortal
if
they
did
not
love
a
change
the
pure
grey
limestone
is
commonplace
hereabouts
i
have
actually
heard
it
said
that
it
will
not
last
yet
in
every
village
stand
the
old
norman
churches
built
entirely
of
local
stone
walls
and
roof
and
many
an
old
manor
house
as
well
lies
in
our
midst
as
good
as
it
was
three
hundred
years
ago
to
me
this
limestone
of
the
hills
is
one
of
the
most
beautiful
features
of
the
cotswold
country
i
love
to
stand
in
a
limestone
quarry
and
mark
the
layers
and
ponderous
blocks
of
clean
white
virgin
rock
a
tiny
cleft
in
the
great
stone
floor
which
stretches
over
the
face
of
the
earth
and
under
the
limitless
expanse
of
the
sea
that
solid
cretaceous
mass
is
but
the
remnants
of
the
countless
inhabitants
of
the
old
seas
life
changed
into
solid
hard
rock
and
even
now
as
the
green
grass
and
the
sweet
sainfoin
spring
up
on
the
surface
feeding
the
flocks
and
herds
that
will
soon
in
their
turn
feed
mankind
earth
is
turning
back
again
into
life
thus
onwards
in
an
endless
cycle
even
as
the
earth
goes
round
and
the
waters
return
to
the
place
from
whence
they
came
does
nature
work
go
on
and
when
we
consider
these
things
eternity
and
infinity
lose
part
of
their
strangeness
does
it
seem
strange
when
we
look
upon
this
glorious
country
in
may
a
sea
of
golden
buttercups
in
summer
a
sea
of
waving
grass
and
in
the
autumn
a
sea
of
golden
corn
once
it
was
a
sea
of
salt
water
and
these
great
rounded
banks
these
hills
and
valleys
these
billowy
wolds
could
they
but
speak
to
us
might
tell
strange
things
of
the
passing
of
the
waters
and
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
old
ocean
ages
and
ages
ago
the
mystery
of
the
sea
would
be
sung
in
every
vale
and
echoed
back
by
every
rolling
down
a
very
wonderful
matter
it
certainly
is
that
the
stone
in
which
the
whole
history
of
the
is
writ
not
only
in
rolling
downs
and
limestone
streams
but
even
in
church
farm
and
cottage
as
well
as
in
the
walls
and
the
roads
and
the
very
dust
that
blows
upon
them
should
be
nothing
more
nor
less
than
a
mass
of
dead
animals
that
lived
generation
after
generation
thousands
of
years
ago
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
there
is
silence
in
the
woods
the
drowsy
silence
of
summer
most
of
the
birds
have
gone
to
the
cornfields
an
ash
copse
is
never
so
full
of
birds
as
the
denser
woodlands
where
the
oaks
grow
stronger
on
a
stiff
clay
soil
here
are
no
laughing
yaffels
no
cruel
murderous
shrikes
and
very
few
still
there
are
always
the
pigeons
and
the
cushats
the
wicked
magpies
and
the
screaming
jaypies
as
the
local
people
call
the
jays
then
too
there
are
the
birds
down
among
the
watercress
and
the
brooklime
in
the
clear
pool
below
the
spring
moorhens
occasionally
awakening
the
echoes
by
running
down
a
weird
chromatic
scale
or
calling
with
their
loud
and
mellow
note
to
their
friends
and
relations
over
at
the
brook
here
too
the
softer
croak
of
the
mallard
and
the
wild
duck
is
also
heard
a
hawk
chasing
some
smaller
bird
is
darting
and
hovering
over
the
tops
of
the
firs
but
catching
a
glimpse
of
me
disappears
from
sight
presently
a
little
bird
with
an
eye
keener
even
than
the
cruel
hawk
comes
out
from
the
hazels
and
perches
on
a
post
some
ten
yards
away
it
is
a
as
he
sits
he
turns
his
eyes
in
every
direction
on
the
for
dainty
insects
he
seems
to
have
eyes
at
the
back
of
his
head
for
instantly
he
sees
a
fly
in
the
air
right
behind
him
makes
a
dash
catches
it
and
flies
on
to
the
next
post
he
repeats
the
performance
there
then
once
more
changes
his
ground
when
he
has
made
another
successful
raid
he
returns
to
his
first
post
always
hunting
in
a
chosen
circuit
and
always
catching
flies
he
was
here
yesterday
and
will
be
here
again
when
you
try
to
approach
him
however
he
flies
away
and
hides
himself
in
the
firs
if
there
are
not
many
birds
in
the
woods
just
now
still
there
is
always
the
beauty
of
the
trees
how
marvellous
is
the
symmetry
of
form
and
colouring
in
the
trunk
and
branches
of
a
big
ash
tree
if
you
put
mercury
into
a
solution
of
nitrate
of
silver
and
leave
them
for
a
few
days
to
combine
the
result
will
be
a
precipitation
of
silver
in
a
lovely
arborescent
form
the
beautiful
beyond
description
such
are
my
favourite
ash
trees
when
the
summer
sunshine
sparkles
on
them
it
is
their
bare
silvered
trunks
that
give
the
special
charm
to
these
hanging
woods
they
stand
out
from
dark
recesses
filled
with
alder
and
beech
and
firs
rising
in
bold
but
graceful
outline
columns
of
silver
touched
here
and
there
with
the
sad
gold
and
green
shades
of
lichen
and
moss
the
moss
that
mingles
with
golden
lichens
is
of
a
soft
velvety
hue
like
a
mantle
of
half
drapery
on
a
beautiful
white
statue
and
oddly
enough
though
ferns
do
not
grow
on
the
limestone
soil
of
the
cotswolds
yet
on
the
first
story
so
to
speak
of
every
big
ash
tree
by
the
river
as
well
as
on
the
pollard
willows
there
is
a
beautiful
little
fernery
springing
up
out
of
the
moss
and
lichen
which
seems
to
thrive
most
when
the
lichen
thrives
in
the
winter
rather
than
in
the
summer
then
too
the
foliage
of
all
kinds
of
trees
and
shrubs
is
not
only
different
in
form
but
the
minutest
serrations
vary
so
that
the
leaves
of
two
kinds
of
trees
are
no
more
alike
than
any
two
human
faces
are
alike
the
elm
leaves
are
rough
to
the
touch
like
sandpaper
and
their
edges
are
clearly
serrated
those
of
the
beeches
are
smooth
as
parchment
and
though
the
edges
appear
at
first
sight
to
be
almost
clean
cut
they
have
very
slight
serrations
as
if
nature
had
rounded
them
with
a
blunt
knife
the
lobed
ivy
leaves
are
likewise
highly
polished
and
they
have
sharp
pointed
tips
the
leaves
of
the
common
the
labourers
call
them
have
deep
indents
all
round
them
a
great
dock
leaf
in
which
the
chives
have
a
strange
resemblance
to
the
arteries
in
the
human
frame
has
small
shallow
indents
all
round
it
hazels
are
rough
and
almost
round
in
form
save
for
a
pointed
tip
at
the
end
they
have
ragged
edges
and
serrations
everybody
knows
the
sycamore
from
its
five
lobed
leaves
and
the
chestnuts
and
oaks
are
again
as
different
as
possible
these
are
only
a
few
instances
one
might
go
on
for
a
long
time
showing
the
endless
variations
of
form
in
foliage
then
there
is
the
remarkable
difference
in
colour
and
shade
not
only
are
there
a
dozen
different
greens
in
one
wood
but
in
one
and
the
same
beech
you
may
see
a
marked
contrast
in
the
tone
of
its
leaves
for
about
midsummer
some
trees
put
forth
a
second
growth
of
foliage
so
that
there
is
the
vivid
yellow
tint
of
the
fresh
shoots
and
the
dark
olive
of
the
older
leaves
on
one
and
the
same
branch
of
the
rich
autumnal
shades
i
am
not
speaking
they
would
require
a
chapter
to
themselves
there
are
other
things
to
be
noted
in
the
woods
besides
the
trees
and
the
birds
lots
of
rabbits
and
squirrels
not
to
mention
an
occasional
hedgehog
squirrels
are
the
most
delightful
of
all
the
furred
denizens
of
the
woods
running
up
the
trees
with
their
long
brushes
straight
out
behind
they
are
not
unlike
miniature
foxes
the
slenderness
of
the
twigs
on
which
they
manage
to
find
support
is
one
of
the
greatest
wonders
of
the
woods
the
harmless
hedgehog
as
everybody
is
aware
rolls
himself
up
into
a
lifeless
ball
of
bristles
on
being
disturbed
by
staying
quietly
by
him
and
addressing
him
in
an
encouraging
tone
i
lately
induced
a
very
large
hedgehog
to
unroll
himself
and
creep
slowly
along
close
to
my
feet
it
is
very
extraordinary
how
all
wild
animals
especially
when
young
can
be
won
by
kindness
i
once
came
across
a
young
hedgehog
about
grown
he
was
running
about
on
the
grass
in
front
of
the
house
in
broad
daylight
and
kept
poking
his
little
nose
into
the
earth
searching
for
emmets
and
grubs
i
made
friends
with
him
dug
him
up
some
worms
and
in
less
than
half
an
hour
he
became
as
tame
as
possible
tom
peregrine
the
keeper
stood
by
and
roared
with
laughter
at
his
antics
saying
he
had
never
seen
such
a
comical
job
in
all
his
life
and
it
really
was
a
curious
sight
the
hedgehog
with
the
merriest
twinkle
in
his
eyes
would
take
the
worms
out
of
my
hand
and
when
i
dangled
them
five
or
six
inches
off
the
ground
he
would
rear
up
on
his
hindlegs
and
snatch
and
grab
until
he
secured
them
then
he
would
sit
up
and
scratch
himself
like
a
dog
he
would
allow
me
to
take
him
up
in
my
hands
and
stroke
him
and
yet
not
retire
into
his
bristly
shell
he
ate
a
dozen
worms
and
a
straight
off
the
reel
and
then
with
all
the
gluttony
of
the
pig
tribe
he
went
searching
about
for
more
food
i
noticed
that
he
ate
the
grass
in
the
same
way
as
dogs
do
for
medicinal
purposes
we
put
him
into
a
large
box
with
some
hay
in
it
and
as
he
still
seemed
hungry
that
evening
we
gave
him
a
couple
of
cockchafers
from
the
kitchen
which
he
appeared
to
relish
mightily
the
little
fellow
was
as
happy
as
a
king
crying
and
squeaking
whenever
we
went
to
look
at
him
and
hunting
round
the
box
for
food
but
alas
we
had
overfed
him
to
our
intense
regret
he
died
the
next
day
from
acute
indigestion
there
are
but
few
snakes
or
vipers
in
the
district
of
which
i
am
writing
but
quite
recently
a
man
found
a
large
trout
about
eighteen
inches
in
length
lying
dead
in
the
coln
and
protruding
from
the
mouth
of
the
fish
was
a
large
snake
also
dead
the
snake
must
have
been
swimming
in
the
water
as
they
are
known
to
do
occasionally
and
the
trout
being
in
a
backwater
where
food
was
scarce
must
have
seized
the
snake
and
choked
himself
in
his
efforts
to
bolt
it
this
was
a
remarkable
occurrence
because
a
coln
trout
is
most
particular
as
to
his
bill
of
fare
and
snakes
are
certainly
not
usually
included
in
the
list
there
is
such
a
plentiful
supply
of
larvae
caddis
shrimps
crayfish
and
other
crustaceans
to
say
nothing
of
flies
minnows
and
small
fry
that
a
trout
would
very
seldom
attack
a
snake
a
large
lobworm
however
as
every
one
knows
is
a
very
attractive
bait
for
any
kind
of
fish
except
pike
stoats
with
backs
and
yellow
bellies
may
often
be
seen
hunting
the
rabbits
and
the
little
weasels
may
sometimes
be
drawn
out
of
their
holes
in
the
walls
if
one
makes
a
squeaking
noise
with
the
lips
stoats
usually
hunt
singly
weasels
in
packs
and
pairs
but
we
must
leave
the
woods
for
the
evening
shadows
are
lengthening
and
the
golden
evening
brightens
in
the
west
it
is
time
to
go
up
to
the
cornfields
on
the
hill
and
see
the
sun
set
i
have
said
that
there
is
no
path
through
this
wood
it
is
sacred
to
foxes
they
are
not
here
now
however
they
will
not
be
back
till
all
the
corn
is
cut
the
wheatfields
are
their
summer

is
no
easy
matter

get
out

we
must
hold
our
hands
high
above
our
heads

plough
our
way
through

we
finally
emerge
we
are
covered
from
head
to

with
large
prickly
burrs
from
the
seeding
burdocks

as
with
the
small
round
burrs
of

we

turn

amidst

over

nothing
is
left
in

but
a
tiny

of

chapter
xvii
autumn
i
it
is
in
the
autumn
that
life
in
an
old
manor
house
on
the
cotswolds
has
its
greatest
charm
for
one
of
the
chief
characteristics
of
a
house
in
the
depths
of
the
country
surrounded
by
a
broad
manor
is
the
game
the
whole
atmosphere
of
such
a
place
savours
of
rabbits
and
hares
and
partridges
there
may
be
no
and
comparatively
little
game
of
any
kind
yet
the
place
is
nevertheless
associated
with
sport
with
the
gun
ten
to
one
there
are
guns
old
and
new
hanging
up
in
the
hall
or
the
and
perhaps
too
there
is
a
bond
between
the
house
and
the
fields
around
and
the
connecting
link
is
the
game
time
was
when
the
squire
in
these
english
villages
lived
on
the
produce
of
the
estate
game
fish
and
fowl
and
the
stock
at

supplied
his
simple

throughout

huge
game
larders
are
yet
to
be
seen
in
the
lower
regions
of
the

you
must
pass
through
them

more

house
and
the
land
you
must
walk
on
the
roads
but
away
in
the
country
it
is
over
the
broad
fields
that
you
roam
even
on
a
small
manor
of
two
thousand
acres
you
may
walk
a
dozen
miles
in
an
afternoon
and
not
pass
the
boundary
fence
it
is
very
surprising
that
there
is
not
more
demand
for
country
houses
in
england
when
one
considers
that
an
extensive
demesne
may
be
rented
at
a
price
which
is
paid
for
a
small
flat
in
unfashionable
kensington
the
local
term
in
gloucestershire
for
renting
a
manor
is
holding
the
liberty
the
old
saxon
word
the
term
is
singularly
expressive
of
the
freedom
possessed
by
the
man
who
exchanges
the
life
of
the
town
or
the
villa
for
a
manor
in
one
of
the
remote
counties
he
who
enjoys
the
sporting
rights
with
license
as
the
leases
run
to
hunt
fish
course
hawk
or
sport
without
the
labour
and
loss
of
farming
the
land
possesses
all
the
pleasures
of
the
squire
existence
with
few
of
its
drawbacks
and
responsibilities
yet
many
a
fine
old
house
in
the
country
remains
unlet
because
the
life
is
considered
a
dull
one
by
those
who
have
not
been
brought
up
to
it
with
nature
book
spread
so
amply
before
our
eyes
the
country
is
never
dull
at
no
time
of
life
is
it
too
late
to
commence
the
study
of
this
book
of
nature
the
faculty
of
observation
is
one
that
is
easily
acquired
it
is
not
a
case
of
non
with
tolerably
good
eyesight
and
a
determination
to
learn
a
man
soon
finds
tongues
in
trees
books
in
the
running
brooks
sermons
in
stones
and
good
in
everything
and
the
habit
of
observing
once
acquired
we
can
never
lose
it
till
we
die
of
course
those
who
rent
a
place
in
preference
to
purchasing
it
miss
one
of
the
greatest
and
most
useful
privileges
the
country
can
confer
that
of
following
in
the
footsteps
of
him
who
strove
for
sixty
widow
years
to
help
his
homelier
brother
man
served
the
poor
and
built
the
cottage
rais
the
school
and
drained
the
fen
these
are
the
true
delights
of
a
country
existence
and
it
is
i
think
incumbent
on
the
really
rich
men
of
england
if
they
have
the
welfare
of
the
nation
at
heart
to
hold
a
stake
however
small
in
the
land
even
at
a
sacrifice
of
income
i
refer
to
men
with
incomes
ranging
from
ten
to
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
per
annum
who
would
not
feel
the
loss
of
interest
that
would
possibly
accrue
on
an
exchange
of
investment
from
the
elegant
simplicity
of
the
three
per
cents
to
an
agricultural
estate
in
the
country
they
may
be
giving
gold
for
silver
in
the
transaction
but
will
be
amply
repaid
in
a
thousand
different
ways
how
infinitely
preferable
the
existence
of
the
poor
countryman
even
though
times
be
hard
to
that
of
the
misguided
being
of
whom
it
may
be
said
through
life
dark
road
his
sordid
way
he
wends
an
incarnation
of
fat
dividends
sprague
it
is
probable
that
the
bicycle
will
cause
a
larger
demand
for
remote
country
houses
to
the
writer
who
previous
to
this
summer
had
never
experienced
the
poetry
of
motion
which
a
bicycle
coasting
downhill
with
a
smooth
road
and
a
favourable
wind
undoubtedly
constitutes
the
invention
seems
of
the
greatest
utility
it
brings
places
sixty
miles
apart
within
our
immediate
neighbourhood
let
the
south
wind
blow
and
we
can
be
at
quaint
old
tewkesbury
thirty
miles
away
in
less
than
three
hours
a
northerly
gale
will
land
us
at
the
and
the
old
white
house
of
berkshire
with
less
labour
than
it
takes
to
walk
a
mile
yet
in
the
old
days
these
twenty
miles
were
a
great
gulf
fixed
between
the
gloucestershire
natives
and
the
over
the
boundary
their
very
language
is
as
different
as
possible
to
this
day
the
villagers
who
went
to
the
last
scouring
of
the
horse
and
saw
the
backsword
play
talk
of
the
expedition
with
as
much
pride
as
if
they
had
made
a
pilgrimage
to
the
antipodes
as
september
draws
nigh
and
the
days
rapidly
shorten
the
merry
hum
of
the
thrashing
machine
is
heard
all
day
long
the
sound
comes
from
the
homestead
across
the
road
and
buzzes
in
my
ears
as
i
sit
and
write
by
the
open
window
how
wonderful
the
evolution
of
the
thrashing
machine
how
the
primitive
methods
of
our
forefathers
first
of
all
there
was
the
eastern
method
of
spreading
the
sheaves
on
a
floor
of
clay
and
allowing
horses
and
oxen
to
trample
on
the
wheat
and
tread
out
the
corn
not
less
ancient
was
the
use
of
the
flail
an
instrument
only
discarded
within
the
memory
of
living
man
yet
what
a
wonderful
difference
there
is
between
the
work
accomplished
in
a
day
with
the
flails
and
the
daily
output
of
the
modern
thrashing
machine
in
the
porch
of
the
manor
house
amid
an
accumulation
of
old
traps
and
other
curious
odds
and
ends
there
hangs
an
ancient
and
flail
two
stout
sticks
the
handstaff
and
the
swingle
attached
to
each
other
by
a
strong
band
of
gut
constitute
its
simple
mechanism
the
wheat
having
been
strewn
on
the
barn
floor
the
labourer
held
the
handstaff
in
both
hands
swung
it
over
his
head
and
brought
the
swingle
down
horizontally
on
to
the
heads
of
ripe
corn
contrast
this
fearfully
laborious
process
with
the
bustling
hurrying
machine
of
and
yet
with
all
this
improvement
the
corn
can
scarcely
be
thrashed
out
at
a
profit
so
out
of
joint
are
the
times
and
seasons
that
the
foreigner
is
allowed
to
cut
out
the
home
producer
half
the
life
of
the
has
gone
and
no
man
dare
whisper
protection
even
in
these
bad
times
the
man
with
a
head
on
his
shoulders
above
the
average
of
his
neighbours
comes
forth
to
show
what
can
be
done
with
energy
and
pluck
twenty
years
ago
a
labouring
man
who
by
crook
or
by
hook
had
saved
a
hundred
pounds
bought
a
thrashing
machine
probably
he
took
it
round
to
the
various
farms
and
did
the
thrashing
at
so
much
per
day
by
and
by
he
had
saved
enough
money
to
take
a
farm
a
few
years
later
he
had
two
thrashing
machines
travelling
the
country
and
in
this
poor
district
is
now
esteemed
a
wealthy
man
i
always
found
him
an
excellent
and
a
most
straightforward
fellow
another
farming
neighbour
of
mine
however
was
always
talking
about
his
ignorance
and
lack
of
caste
all
classes
from
the
peer
to
the
peasant
seem
to
resent
a
man
pushing
his
way
from
what
they
are
pleased
to
consider
a
lower
station
into
their
own
in
the
autumn
gipsies
are
to
be
seen
travelling
the
roads
or
sitting
round
the
camp
fire
on
their
way
to
the
various
feasts
or
harvest
festivals
have
you
got
the
old
gipsy
blood
in
your
veins
i
asked
the
other
day
of
a
gang
i
met
on
their
way
to
quenington
feast
always
gipsies
ever
since
we
can
remember
was
the
reply
fathers
grandfathers
were
just
the
same
always
living
in
the
open
air
winter
and
summer
and
always
moving
about
with
the
vans
in
the
winter
hawking
is
their
occupation
oh
no
they
never
felt
the
cold
in
winter
they
could
light
the
fire
in
the
van
if
they
wanted
it
although
many
of
the
farmers
here
have
given
up
treating
their
men
to
a
spread
after
the
harvest
is
gathered
in
there
is
still
a
certain
amount
of
rejoicing
the
villagers
have
a
little
money
over
from
extra
pay
during
the
harvest
so
that
the
gipsies
do
not
do
badly
by
going
the
round
of
the
villages
at
this
time
the
village
churches
are
decorated
in
a
very
delightful
manner
for
these
feasts
such
huge
apples
carrots
and
turnips
in
the
windows
and
strewn
about
in
odd
places
lots
of
golden
barley
all
round
the
pulpit
and
the
font
and
perhaps
there
will
be
bunches
of
grapes
such
as
grow
wild
on
the
cottage
walls
hung
round
the
pulpit
then
what
could
look
prettier
against
the
white
carved
stone
than
the
russet
and
gold
leaves
of
the
virginia
creeper
and
these
they
freely
use
in
the
decorations
if
one
wants
to
see
good
taste
displayed
in
these
days
one
must
go
to
simple
country
places
to
find
it
at
christmas
the
old
gothic
fane
is
hung
with
festoons
of
ivy
and
of
yew
in
the
old
fashion
of
our
forefathers
i
paid
a
visit
to
my
old
friend
john
brown
the
other
day
as
i
thought
he
would
be
able
to
tell
me
something
about
the
harvest
feasts
of
bygone
days
he
is
a
dear
old
man
of
some
summers
though
somewhat
of
the
temporis
school
but
what
and
sense
of
humour
there
is
in
the
good
honest
face
fifty
year
ago
all
mirth
and
jollity
he
replied
to
our
enquiry
as
to
the
old
times
there
was
four
feasts
in
the
year
for
us
folk
first
of
all
there
was
the
sower
feast
that
would
be
about
the
end
of
april
then
came
the
feast
there
be
about
fifteen
of
us
as
would
sit
down
after
and
we
be
singing
best
part
of
the
night
and
plenty
to
eat
and
drink
next
came
the
feast
for
the
reapers
when
the
corn
was
cut
about
august
and
last
of
all
the
harvest
home
in
september
ah
those
were
good
times
fifty
years
ago
my
father
and
i
have
rented
this
cottage
years
come
michaelmas
and
my
father
grandfather
lived
in
that
housen
up
that
there
nigh
on
a
hundred
years
afore
that
i
planted
them
ash
trees
in
the
grove
and
i
mind
when
those
firs
was
put
in
near
seventy
years
ago
ah
there
some
foxes
about
in
those
days
trout
too
in
the
it
were
full
of
them
you
have
very
few
for
hunting
this
season
be
a
mild
time
again
last
night
were
hollandtide
eve
and
where
the
wind
is
at
hollandtide
there
it
will
stick
best
part
of
the
winter
i
minded
it
every
year
and
never
was
wrong
yet
the
wind
is
and
you
have
no
for
hunting
this
time
lets
appear
to
be
hindrances
to
hunting
in
the
shape
of
frosts
it
is
an
word
seldom
used
nowadays
though
it
is
found
in
the
dictionary
and
our
english
prayer
book
has
the
words
we
are
sore
let
and
hindered
in
running
the
race
etc
shakespeare
too
employs
it
to
signify
a
check
with
the
hounds
as
i
left
and
thanked
john
brown
for
his
information
he
handed
me
a
little
bit
of
paper
whereon
was
written
to
john
brown
day
minding
the
edge
at
the
picked
cloos
three
days
doto
etc
i
found
that
this
was
his
little
account
for
mending
the
hedge
at
the
picket
close
a
fine
stamp
of
humanity
is
the
cotswold
labourer
and
may
his
shadow
never
grow
less
princes
and
lords
may
flourish
or
may
fade
a
breath
can
make
them
as
a
breath
has
made
but
a
bold
peasantry
their
country
pride
when
once
destroyed
can
never
be
supplied
fresh
and
is
the
breeze
on
the
wolds
in
autumn
like
the
driest
and
oldest
iced
champagne
in
the
rough
grass
fields
tough
wiry
bents
thistles
with
purple
flowers
and
the
remnants
of
oxeye
daisies
on
brittle
stalks
rise
almost
to
the
height
of
your
knees
lovely
blue
grow
in
patches
golden
ragwort
two
sorts
of
field
scabious
yellow
and
occasionally
some
white
campion
remain
almost
into
winter
where
the
grass
is
shorter
masses
of
shrivelled
wild
thyme
may
be
seen
the
charlock
brightens
the
landscape
with
its
mass
of
colour
among
the
turnips
until
the
end
of
november
if
the
season
be
fairly
mild
but
the
hedges
and
trees
are
the
glory
of
the
happy
autumn
fields
the
traveller
joy
gleams
in
the
september
sunlight
as
the
feathery
awns
lengthen
on
its
seed
vessels
what
could
be
more
beautiful
later
on
it
becomes
the
old
man
beard
and
the
hedges
will
be
white
with
the
snowy
down
right
up
to
christmas
until
the
winter
frosts
have
once
more
scattered
the
seeds
along
the
hedgerow
of
a
rich
russet
tint
are
the
maple
leaves
in
every
copse
and
fence
on
the
blackthorn
hang
the
purple
sloeberries
like
small
damsons
luscious
and
covered
with
bloom
tart
are
they
to
the
taste
like
the
which
abound
in
the
hedges
these
fruits
are
picked
by
the
poor
people
and
made
into
wine
may
be
seen
on
the
trees
as
late
as
january
blackberries
are
found
in
extraordinary
numbers
on
this
limestone
soil
and
the
hedges
are
full
of
as
well
as
the
little
black
fruit
of
the
privet
add
to
these
the
red
berries
of
the
hawthorn
or
the
may
the
hips
and
haws
the
brown
nuts
and
the
succulent
berries
of
the
yew
and
we
have
an
extraordinary
variety
of
fruits
and
bird
food
woodbine
or
wild
honeysuckle
may
often
be
picked
during
october
as
well
as
in
the
spring
by
the
river
the
trout
grow
darker
and
more
lanky
day
by
day
as
the
nights
lengthen
the
water
is
very
very
clear
you
might
as
well
throw
your
in
as
try
to
catch
them
says
tom
peregrine
the
willows
are
gold
as
well
as
silver
now
for
some
of
the
leaves
have
turned
while
others
still
show
white
downy
backs
when
the
breeze
ruffles
them
in
the
garden
by
the
the
tall
are
seeding
the
pods
are
bursting
and
the
grey
down
the
silver
mist
of
tennyson
is
conspicuous
all
along
the
brook
the
and
remain
far
into
november
and
the
former
scents
more
sweetly
as
the
season
wanes
but
heavily
hangs
the
broad
sunflower
over
its
grave
in
the
earth
so
chilly
heavily
hangs
the
hollyhock
heavily
hangs
the
tiger
lily
an
old
wild
duck
that
left
the
garden
last
spring
to
rear
her
progeny
in
a
more
secluded
spot
half
a
mile
up
stream
has
returned
to
us
every
morning
her
ten
young
ones
pitch
down
into
the
water
in
front
of
the
house
and
remain
until
they
are
disturbed
then
with
loud
quacks
and
tumultuous
flappings
they
rise
in
a
long
string
and
fly
right
away
for
several
miles
often
returning
at
nightfall
such
wild
birds
are
far
more
interesting
as
occasional
visitors
to
your
garden
than
the
fancy
fowl
of
strange
shape
and
colouring
often
to
be
seen
on
ornamental
water
a
teal
came
during
the
autumn
of
to
the
sanctuary
in
front
of
the
house
attracted
by
the
decoys
she
stayed
six
weeks
with
us
taking
daily
exercise
in
the
skies
at
an
immense
height
and
circling
round
and
round
unfortunately
when
the
weeds
were
cut
she
left
us
never
to
return
by
the
end
of
october
almost
all
our
summer
birds
have
left
us
first
of
all
in
august
went
the
cuckoo
seeking
a
winter
resort
in
the
north
of
africa
the
swifts
were
the
next
to
go
after
a
brief
stay
of
scarce
three
months
they
disappeared
as
suddenly
in
august
as
they
came
in
may
the
swallows
and
the
martins
were
with
us
for
six
months
but
about
the
middle
of
october
they
were
no
more
seen
all
have
gone
southwards
towards
the
afric
shore
seeking
warmth
and
days
of
endless
sunshine
gone
too
the
blackcap
the
redstart
and
the
little
vanishing
in
the
dark
night
they
gathered
in
legions
and
sped
across
the
seas
one
night
towards
the
end
of
september
whilst
walking
in
the
road
i
heard
such
a
loud
rushing
sound
in
front
beyond
a
turning
of
the
lane
that
i
imagined
a
thrashing
machine
was
coming
round
the
corner
among
the
big
elm
trees
but
on
approaching
the
spot
i
found
the
noise
was
nothing
more
nor
less
than
the
chattering
and
clattering
of
an
immense
concourse
of
starlings
the
roar
of
their
wings
when
they
were
disturbed
in
the
trees
could
be
heard
half
a
mile
away
although
a
few
starlings
remain
round
the
eaves
of
the
houses
throughout
the
winter
vast
flocks
of
them
assemble
at
this
time
in
the
fields
and
some
doubtless
travel
southwards
and
westwards
in
search
of
warmer
quarters
the
other
evening
a
large
flock
of
lapwings
or
common
plover
gave
a
very
fine
display
a
sort
of
serpentine
dance
to
the
tune
of
the
setting
sun
all
for
my
edification
they
could
not
quite
make
up
their
minds
to
settle
on
a
brown
ploughed
field
no
sooner
had
they
touched
the
ground
than
they
would
rise
again
with
shrill
cries
flash
here
and
flash
there
faster
and
faster
but
all
in
perfect
time
and
all
in
perfect
order
now
flying
in
long
drawn
out
lines
now
in
battalions
bowing
here
bowing
there
now
they
would
right
about
turn
and
curtsey
to
the
sun
a
thousand
trained
ballet
dancer
could
not
have
been
in
better
time
it
was
as
if
all
joined
hands
dressed
in
green
and
white
for
at
every
turn
a
thousand
white
breasts
gleamed
in
the
purple
sunset
the
restless
call
of
the
birds
added
a
peculiar
charm
to
the
scene
in
the
darkening
twilight
of
our
winter
visitants
that
come
to
take
the
place
of
the
summer
migrants
the
fieldfare
is
the
commonest
and
most
familiar
ere
the
leaf
is
off
the
ash
and
the
beeches
are
tinged
with
russet
and
gold
flocks
of
these
handsome
birds
leave
their
homes
in
the
north
and
fly
southwards
to
england
and
the
sunny
shores
of
france
such
a
as
the
grey
phalarope
a
wading
bird
like
the
sandpiper
occasionally
finds
its
way
to
the
cotswolds
wild
geese
curlews
and
wimbrels
with
sharp
beaks
are
shot
occasionally
by
the
farmers
a
few
woodcocks
snipe
and
wildfowl
also
visit
us
in
the
winter
the
owls
come
they
are
rarer
than
their
relatives
who
stay
with
us
all
the
year
the
common
barn
owl
of
a
white
creamy
colour
is
the
screech
owl
that
we
hear
on
summer
nights
brown
owls
are
the
ones
that
hoot
they
do
not
screech
curiously
enough
i
missed
the
corncrake
call
in
the
meadows
by
the
river
in
the
springtime
of
and
not
one
was
bagged
in
september
by
the
this
is
the
first
year
they
have
been
absent
i
always
looked
for
their
pleasing
croak
in
may
by
the
trout
stream
and
invariably
shot
several
while
in
former
years
the
earthquake
of
was
very
severely
felt
in
the
cotswolds
next
to
an
earthquake
a
bad
thunderstorm
is
the
most
awe
inspiring
of
all
things
to
mortals
during
last
autumn
the
cotswold
district
was
visited
by
a
thunderstorm
of
short
duration
but
great
severity
a
gale
was
blowing
from
the
south
thunder
and
lightning
came
up
from
the
same
direction
and
travelling
at
an
immense
speed
passed
rapidly
over
our
house
about
ten
the
shocks
became
louder
and
louder
and
whilst
five
or
six
of
us
were
watching
the
lightning
from
a
large
window
in
the
hall
there
was
a
deafening
report
as
of
a
dozen
canons
exploding
simultaneously
at
close
quarters
at
the
same
time
a
flame
of
blue
fire
of
intense
brilliancy
seemed
to
fall
like
a
meteor
a
few
yards
in
front
of
our
eyes
at
first
we
were
sure
the
house
had
been
struck
so
that
the
first
impulse
was
to
rush
out
of
doors
but
the
succeeding
report
being
much
less
severe
confidence
was
restored
the
general
conclusion
was
that
a
thunderbolt
had
fallen
and
missing
the
house
by
a
few
yards
had
disappeared
in
the
earth
a
search
next
morning
on
the
lawn
did
not
throw
any
light
on
the
matter
probably
if
there
was
a
thunderbolt
it
fell
into
the
river
for
it
is
well
known
that
water
is
a
great
conductor
of
the
electric
fluid
and
thunderstorms
often
seem
to
follow
the
course
of
a
stream
the
summer
lightning
which
kept
the
sky
in
a
blaze
of
light
for
two
hours
after
the
storm
had
passed
away
was
the
finest
i
remember
it
is
a
pity
mankind
is
so
little
addicted
to
being
out
of
doors
after
sunset
some
of
the
most
beautiful
drives
and
walks
i
have
ever
enjoyed
have
been
those
taken
at
night
driving
out
one
evening
from
cirencester
the
road
on
either
side
was
illuminated
with
the
fairy
lights
of
countless
it
is
the
female
insect
that
is
usually
responsible
for
this
wonderful
green
signal
taper
the
males
seldom
use
it
whereas
the
former
is
merely
an
apterous
creeping
grub
the
latter
is
an
insect
provided
with
wings
flying
about
at
night
he
is
guided
to
his
mate
by
the
light
she
puts
forth
and
it
is
a
peculiar
characteristic
of
the
male
that
his
eyes
are
so
placed
that
he
is
unable
to
view
any
object
that
is
not
immediately
beneath
him
it
is
early
in
summer
that
these
wonderful
lights
are
to
be
seen
june
is
the
best
month
for
observing
them
during
july
and
august
seem
to
migrate
to
warmer
quarters
in
sheltered
banks
and
holes
nor
is
their
light
visible
to
the
eye
after
june
is
out
save
on
very
warm
evenings
and
then
only
in
a
lesser
degree
the
on
this
particular
night
were
so
numerous
as
to
remind
one
of
the
fireflies
in
the
tropics
at
no
place
are
these
lovely
insects
more
numerous
and
resplendent
than
at
kandy
in
ceylon
myriads
of
them
flit
about
in
the
cool
evening
atmosphere
giving
the
appearance
of
countless
meteors
darting
in
different
directions
across
the
sky
in
the
clear
cotswold
atmosphere
very
brilliant
meteors
are
observable
at
certain
seasons
of
the
year
never
shall
i
forget
the
strange
variety
of
phenomena
witnessed
whilst
driving
homewards
one
evening
in
autumn
from
the
railway
station
seven
miles
away
there
had
been
a
time
of
stormy
unsettled
weather
for
some
weeks
previously
and
the
meteorological
conditions
were
in
a
very
disturbed
state
but
as
i
started
homewards
the
stars
were
shining
brightly
whilst
far
away
in
the
western
sky
beyond
the
rolling
downs
and
bleak
plains
of
the
cotswold
hills
shone
forth
the
strange
mysterious
zodiacal
light
towering
upwards
into
a
point
among
the
stars
and
shaped
in
the
form
of
a
cone
it
was
the
first
occasion
this
curious
unexplained
phenomenon
had
ever
come
under
my
notice
and
it
was
awe
inspiring
enough
in
itself
but
before
i
had
gone
more
than
two
miles
of
my
solitary
journey
great
black
clouds
came
up
behind
me
from
the
south
and
i
knew
i
was
racing
with
the
storm
then
as
the
great
organ
of
eternity
began
to
play
and
the
ominous
murmurs
of
distant
thunder
broke
the
silence
of
the
night
a
stiff
breeze
from
the
south
seemed
to
come
from
behind
and
pass
me
as
if
travelling
quicker
than
my
nag
like
a
whisper
from
the
grave
it
rustled
in
the
brown
lifeless
leaves
that
still
lingered
on
the
trees
making
me
wish
i
was
nearer
the
old
house
that
i
knew
was
ready
to
welcome
me
five
miles
on
in
the
little
valley
nestling
under
the
sheltering
hill
and
soon
more
clouds
seemed
to
spring
up
suddenly
north
south
east
and
west
where
ten
minutes
before
the
sky
had
been
clear
and
starry
and
the
sheet
lightning
began
to
play
over
them
with
a
continuous
flow
of
silvery
radiance
north
answering
south
and
east
giving
back
to
west
the
reflected
glory
of
the
mighty
electric
fluid
but
the
centre
of
the
heavens
was
still
clear
and
free
from
cloud
so
that
there
yet
remained
a
large
open
space
in
front
of
me
wherein
the
stars
shone
brighter
than
ever
and
as
i
gazed
forward
and
upward
and
urged
the
willing
horse
into
a
trot
the
open
space
in
the
heavens
revealed
the
glories
of
the
finest
display
of
fireworks
i
have
ever
seen
first
of
all
two
or
three
smaller
stars
shot
across
the
hemisphere
and
disappeared
into
eternal
space
but
suddenly
a
brilliant
light
like
an
enormous
rocket
appeared
in
the
western
sky
far
above
the
clouds
first
it
moved
in
a
steady
flight
hovering
like
a
kestrel
above
us
then
with
a
flash
which
startled
me
out
of
my
wits
and
brought
my
horse
to
a
standstill
it
rushed
apparently
towards
us
and
finally
disappeared
behind
the
clouds
it
was
some
time
before
either
horse
or
driver
regained
the
nerve
which
had
for
a
time
forsaken
them
and
even
then
i
was
inclined
to
attribute
this
wonderful
meteoric
shower
to
a
display
of
fireworks
in
a
neighbouring
village
so
close
to
us
had
this
last
shooting
star
appeared
to
be
a
meteor
which
is
sufficiently
brilliant
to
frighten
a
horse
and
make
him
stop
dead
is
of
rare
occurrence
i
was
thankful
when
i
reached
home
in
safety
that
i
had
not
only
won
my
race
against
the
storm
but
that
i
had
seen
no
more
atmospheric
phenomena
of
so
startling
a
nature
in
addition
to
the
wonders
of
the
heaven
there
are
many
other
interesting
features
connected
with
a
drive
or
walk
by
the
light
of
the
stars
or
the
moon
a
cotswold
village
seen
by
moonlight
is
even
more
picturesque
than
it
is
by
day
the
old
gabled
manor
houses
are
a
delightful
picture
on
a
cold
frosty
night
in
winter
if
most
of
the
rooms
are
lit
up
they
give
one
the
idea
of
endless
hospitality
and
cheerfulness
when
viewed
from
without
to
walk
by
a
stream
such
as
the
coln
on
such
a
night
is
for
the
time
like
being
in
fairyland
every
eddy
and
ripple
is
transformed
into
a
crystal
stream
sparkling
with
a
thousand
diamonds
the
sound
of
the
waters
as
they
gurgle
and
bubble
over
the
stones
on
the
shallows
seems
for
all
the
world
like
voices
plaintively
repeating
over
and
over
again
the
old
strain
i
chatter
chatter
as
i
flow
to
join
the
brimming
river
for
men
may
come
and
men
may
go
but
i
go
on
for
ever
now
is
the
time
to
discover
the
haunts
of
wild
duck
and
other
shy
birds
like
the
teal
and
the
heron
in
frosty
weather
many
of
these
visitors
come
and
go
without
our
being
any
the
wiser
unless
we
are
out
at
night
before
sunrise
they
will
be
far
far
away
and
will
probably
never
return
any
more
time
after
time
we
have
been
startled
by
a
flight
of
duck
rising
abruptly
from
the
stream
in
places
where
by
day
one
would
never
dream
of
looking
for
them
foxes
too
may
be
seen
within
a
stone
throw
of
the
house
on
a
moonlight
evening
they
love
to
prowl
around
on
the
chance
of
a
dainty
morsel
such
as
a
fat
duck
or
a
moorhen
nor
will
they
take
any
notice
of
you
at
such
a
time
i
made
a
midnight
expedition
once
last
hunting
season
to
see
that
the
earths
were
properly
stopped
in
some
small
coverts
situated
on
a
bleak
and
lonely
spot
on
the
cotswold
hills
on
the
way
i
had
to
pass
close
to
a
large
barrow
weird
indeed
looked
the
old
stone
that
has
stood
for
thousands
of
years
at
the
end
of
this
old
burial
mound
a
small
wood
close
by
rejoices
in
the
name
of
deadman
acre
the
moon
was
casting
a
ghastly
light
over
the
great
stone
and
the
deserted
wolds
the
words
of
ossian
rose
to
my
lips
as
i
wondered
what
manner
of
men
lay
buried
here
we
shall
pass
away
like
a
dream
our
tombs
will
be
lost
on
the
heath
the
hunter
shall
not
know
the
place
of
our
rest
give
us
the
song
of
other
years
let
the
night
pass
away
on
the
sound
and
morning
return
with
joy
then
as
the
rustling
wind
spoke
in
the
lifeless
leaves
of
the
beeches
the
plain
seemed
to
be
peopled
with
strange
phantasies
the
ghosts
of
the
heroes
of
old
and
a
voice
came
back
to
me
on
the
whispering
breeze
thou
too
must
share
our
fate
for
human
life
is
short
soon
will
thy
tomb
be
hid
and
the
grass
grow
rank
on
thy
grave
macpherson
and
sometimes
when
i
have
been
up
on
the
hills
by
night
and
looking
away
over
the
broad
vale
stretched
out
below
have
seen
in
the
distance
the
gliding
lights
of
some
great
western
express
a
trusty
bearing
through
the
darkness
its
precious
burden
of
humanity
i
thought
of
the
time
when
the
old
seas
ran
here
and
then
there
seemed
to
come
from
the
direction
of
the
old
white
horse
and
wayland
smith
cave
the
faint
murmuring
sound
of
the
king
alfred
that
summoner
of
men
to
arms
a
thousand
years
ago
like
the
beacons
of
later
days
that
shone
on
beachy
head
and
i
felt
like
a
man
standing
at
the
prow
of
a
mighty
liner
homeward
bound
on
some
fine
though
dark
and
starless
evening
when
no
sound
breaks
upon
his
ear
but
the
monotonous
beating
of
the
screw
and
the
ceaseless
flow
of
unfathomed
waters
save
that
ever
and
anon
in
the
far
distance
the
moaning
foghorn
sounds
its
note
of
warning
whilst
as
he
stands
forward
and
inhales
the
pure
salt
distilled
from
balmy
vapours
that
rise
everlastingly
from
the
surface
of
the
deep
nothing
is
visible
to
the
eye
straining
westward
for
a
glimpse
of
white
chalk
cliffs
or
eastward
perhaps
for
the
first
peep
of
dawn
save
the
intermittent
flash
from
the
lighthouse
tower
and
the
signals
glowing
weird
and
fiery
that
reveal
in
the
misty
darkness
those
softly
gliding
phantasies
the
ships
that
pass
in
the
night
ii
in
nine
years
out
of
ten
autumn
lingers
on
until
the
death
of
the
old
year
then
with
the
advent
of
the
new
our
english
winter
begins
in
earnest
it
is
christmas
day
and
so
lovely
is
the
weather
that
i
am
sitting
on
the
terrace
watching
the
warm
grateful
sun
gradually
disappearing
through
the
grey
ash
trunks
in
the
hanging
wood
beyond
the
river
the
birds
are
singing
with
all
the
promise
of
an
early
spring
there
is
scarcely
a
breath
of
wind
stirring
and
one
might
almost
imagine
it
to
be
april
tom
peregrine
clad
in
his
best
sunday
homespun
passes
along
his
track
through
the
rough
grass
beyond
the
water
intent
on
visiting
his
vermin
traps
or
bent
on
some
form
of
destruction
for
he
is
never
happy
unless
he
is
killing
my
old
friend
the
cock
pheasant
who
for
the
third
year
in
succession
has
contrived
to
escape
our
annual
battue
comes
up
to
my
feet
to
take
the
bread
i
offer
when
he
was
flushed
by
the
beaten
there
was
no
need
to
call
spare
him
for
with
all
the
cunning
of
a
veteran
he
towered
straight
into
the
skies
and
passed
over
the
guns
out
of
shot
two
fantail
pigeons
of
purest
white
sitting
in
a
dark
yew
tree
that
overhangs
the
stream
a
hundred
yards
away
make
the
prettiest
picture
in
the
world
against
the
dusky
foliage
splash
a
great
brown
trout
rolls
in
the
shallow
water
like
a
porpoise
in
the
sea
a
in
this
little
stream
makes
as
much
fuss
as
a
salmon
in
the
mighty
tweed
hark
was
that
a
lamb
bleating
down
in
old
mr
peregrine
meadow
it
was
the
first
lamb
herald
of
the
spring
that
is
to
be
may
its
little
life
be
as
peaceful
as
this
its
first
birthday
less
stormy
than
the
life
of
that
lamb
whose
birth
all
people
celebrate
the
rooks
are
cawing
and
a
faint
cry
of
plover
comes
from
the
hill
soft
and
grey
is
the
winter
sky
but
behold
round
the
sun
in
the
west
there
arises
a
perfect
solar
halo
very
similar
to
an
ordinary
rainbow
but
smaller
in
its
arc
and
fainter
in
its
hues
of
yellow
and
rose
a
very
beautiful
phenomenon
and
one
seldom
to
be
seen
in
england
halos
of
this
nature
are
supposed
to
arise
from
the
double
refraction
of
the
rays
from
the
sun
as
the
light
passes
through
thin
clouds
or
from
the
transmission
of
light
through
particles
of
ice
it
lingers

dies
away
does
this

rough

surely
the
cruel
boreas
and
the
frost
will
not
come
suddenly
on
us
after
this
lovely
mild
christmas
listen
to
the
christmas
bells
ringing
two
miles
away
at
barnsley
village
i
we
can
never
tire
of
the
sound
here
for
it
is
only
on
very
still
days
that
it
reaches
us
across
the
wolds
hark
in
the
air
around
above
the
angelic
music
soars
and
swells
and
in
the
garden
that
i
love
i
hear
the
sound
of
christmas
bells
from
hamlet
hollow
village
height
the
silvery
message
seems
to
start
and
far
away
its
notes
are
surging
through
the
city

assurance
clear
to
those
who
fret
vanished
faith
and
feelings
fled

not

from

the

the

it
scales
the

and
rippling
on
up
rings
of

sounds
faint
and
fainter

alfred
austin
i
have
culled
these
lines
from
the
poet
laureate
charming
christmas
carol
as
they
are
both
singularly
beautiful
and
singularly
appropriate
to
our
cotswold
village
i
take
the
liberty
of
saying
that
in
our
little
hamlet
there
peace
and
goodwill
rich
and
poor
at
now
is
the
ancient
feud
forgot
the
growing
grudge
is
laid
aside
our
humble
rejoicings
during
this
last
christmas
were
very
similar
to
those
of
a
hundred
years
ago
they
included
a
grand
smoking
concert
at
the
club
during
which
the
mummers
gave
an
admirable
performance
of
their
old
play
of
which
more
anon
then
a
big
feed
for
every
man
woman
and
child
of
the
hamlet
about
a
hundred
souls
was
held
in
the
manor
house
added
to
which
we
received
visits
from
carol
singers
and
musicians
of
all
kinds
to
the
number
of
reckoning
up
the
total
aggregate
of
the
different
bands
all
of
whom
were
welcomed
for
christmas
comes
but
once
a
year
after
all
and
the
more
the
merrier
should
be
our
motto
at
this
time
so
from
villages
three
and
four
miles
away
came
bands
of
children
to
sing
the
old
old
songs
the
brass
band
including
old
men
who
fifty
years
ago
with
strings
and
led
the
psalmody
at
chedworth
church
come
too
and
play
inside
the
hall
we
do
not
brew
at
home
nowadays
even
such
conservatives
as
old
mr
peregrine
senior
have
at
length
given
up
the
custom
so
we
can
not
like
sir
roger
allow
a
greater
quantity
of
malt
to
our
small
beer
at
christmas
but
we
take
good
care
to
order
in
some
four
or
five
casks
at
this
time
let
it
be
added
that
we
never
saw
any
man
the
worse
for
drink
in
consequence
of
this
apparent
indiscretion
but
then
we
have
a
butler
of
the
old
school
when
we
held
our
yuletide
revels
in
the
manor
house
and
the
old
walls
rang
with
the
laughter
and
merriment
of
the
whole
hamlet
for
farmers
as
well
as
labourers
honoured
us
it
occurred
to
me
that
the
bigotphones
which
had
been
lying
by
in
a
cupboard
for
about
a
twelvemonth
might
amuse
the
company
bigotphones
i
must
explain
to
those
readers
who
are
uninitiated
are
delightfully
simple
contrivances
fitted
with
reed
mouthpieces
exact
representations
in
mockery
of
the
various
instruments
that
make
up
a
brass
band
but
composed
of
strong
cardboard
and
dependent
solely
on
the
judicious
application
of
the
human
lips
and
the
skilful
modulation
of
the
human
voice
for
their
effect
these
being
produced
an
impromptu
band
was
formed
young
peregrine
seized
the
bassoon
the
carter
took
the
clarionet
the
shepherd
the
french
horn
the
cowman
the
trombone
and
seated
at
the
piano
i
myself
conducted
the
orchestra
never
before
have
i
been
so
astonished
as
i
was
by
the
unexpected
musical
ability
displayed
no
matter
what
tune
i
struck
up
that
heterogeneous
orchestra
played
it
as
if
they
had
been
doing
nothing
else
all
their
lives
the
british
grenadiers
the
eton
boating
song
two
lovely
black
eyes
solo
young
peregrine
on
the
bassoon
a
fine
hunting
day
all
and
sundry
were
performed
in
perfect
time
and
without
a
false
note
singularly
enough
it
is
very
difficult
for
the
voice
to
go
flat
on
the
bigotphone
then
not
content
with
these
popular
songs
we
inaugurated
a
dance
now
could
be
seen
the
beautiful
and
accomplished
miss
peregrine
doing
the
light
fantastic
round
the
stone
floor
of
the
hall
to
the
tune
of
see
me
dance
the
polka
then
too
the
stately
mrs
peregrine
insisted
on
our
playing
sir
roger
de
coverley
and
it
was
danced
with
that
pomp
and
ceremony
which
such
occasions
alone
are
wont
to
show
none
of
your
kitchen
lancers
for
us
hamlet
folk
we
leave
that
kind
of
thing
to
the
swells
and
nobs
tom
peregrine
alone
was
baffled
whilst
his
family
in
general
were
bowing
there
curtseying
here
clapping
hands
and
passing
under
to
the
right
in
the
usual
sir
roger
style
he
stood
in
grey
homespun
of
the
best
material
i
never
yet
saw
a
cotswold
man
in
a
vulgar
chessboard
suit
and
as
he
stood
he
marvelled
greatly
exclaiming
now
and
then
well
i
never
this
is
something
new
to
be
sure
i
never
saw
such
things
in
all
my
life
never
he
would
not
dance
but
seizing
one
of
the
bigotphones
he
blew
into
it
until
i
was
in
some
anxiety
lest
he
should
have
an
apoplectic
fit
i
need
scarcely
say
he
failed
to
produce
a
single
note
thus
our
yuletide
festivities
passed
away
all
enjoying
themselves
immensely
and
thus
was
sealed
the
bond
of
fellowship
and
of
goodwill
class
and
class
for
the
coming
year
whilst
the
younger
folks
danced
the
fathers
of
the
hamlet
walked
on
tiptoe
with
fearful
tread
around
the
house
looking
at
the
faded
family
portraits
i
was
pleased
to
find
that
what
they
liked
best
was
the
ancient
armour
for
said
they
doubtless
squire
wore
that
in
the
old
battles
hereabouts
when
oliver
cromwell
was
round
these
parts
on
my
pointing
out
the
picture
of
the
man
who
built
the
house
three
hundred
years
ago
they
surrounded
it
and
gazed
at
the
features
for
a
great
length
of
time
indeed
i
feared
that
they
would
never
come
away
so
fascinated
were
they
by
this
relic
of
antiquity
illustrating
the
ancient
though
simple
annals
of
their
village
i
persuaded
the
head
of
our
mummer
troop
to
write
out
their
play
as
it
was
handed
down
to
him
by
his
predecessors
this
he
did
in
a
fine
bold
hand
on
four
sides
of
foolscap
unfortunately
the
literary
quality
of
the
lines
is
so
poor
that
they
are
hardly
worth
reproducing
except
as
a
specimen
of
the
poetry
of
very
early
times
handed
down
by
oral
tradition
suffice
it
to
say
that
the
are
five
in
number
father
christmas
saint
george
a
turkish
knight
the
doctor
and
an
old
woman
all
are
dressed
in
paper
flimsies
of
various
shapes
and
colours
first
of
all
enters
father
christmas
in
comes
i
old
father
christmas
welcome
in
or
welcome
not
sometimes
cold
and
sometimes
hot
i
hope
father
christmas
will
never
be
forgot
etc
then
saint
george
comes
in
and
after
a
great
deal
of
bragging
he
fights
the
most
dreadful
battle
that
ever
was
known
his
adversary
being
the
knight
just
come
from
with
the
inevitable
result
that
the
turkish
knight
falls
this
brings
in
the
doctor
who
suggests
the
following
remedies
give
him
a
bucket
of
dry
hot
ashes
to
eat
groom
him
down
with
a
bezom
stick
and
give
him
a
yard
and
a
half
of
pump
water
to
drink
for
these
offices
he
mentions
that
his
fee
is
fifty
guineas
but
he
will
take
ten
pounds
adding
i
can
cure
the
itchy
pitchy
palsy
and
the
gout
pains
within
or
pains
without
a
broken
leg
or
a
broken
arm
or
a
broken
limb
of
any
sort
i
cured
old
mother
roundabout
etc
he
declares
that
he
is
not
one
of
those
quack
doctors
who
go
about
from
house
to
house
telling
you
more
lies
in
one
than
what
you
can
find
true
in
seven
years
so
the
knight
just
come
from
is
resuscitated
and
sent
back
to
his
own
country
last
of
all
the
old
woman
speaks
in
comes
i
old
betsy
bub
on
my
shoulder
i
carry
my
tub
and
in
my
hand
a
do
you
think
i
a
jolly
old
man
now
last
christmas
my
father
killed
a
fat
hog
and
my
mother
made
enough
to
choke
a
dog
and
they
hung
them
up
with
a
pudden
string
till
the
fat
dropped
out
and
the
maggots
crawled
in
etc
the
mummers
play
of
which
the
above
is
a
very
brief
lasts
about
half
an
hour
and
includes
many
songs
of
a
topical
nature
yes
christmas
is
christmas
still
in
the
heart
of
old
england
we
are
apt
to
talk
of
the
good
old
days
that
are
no
more
lamenting
the
customs
and
country
sports
that
have
passed
away
but
let
us
not
forget
that
two
hundred
years
hence
when
we
who
are
living
now
will
have
long
passed
that
bourne
from
which
no
traveller
returns
our
descendants
as
they
sit
round
their
hearths
at
yuletide
may
in
the
same
way
regret
the
grand
old
times
when
good
victoria
the
greatest
monarch
of
all
ages
was
queen
of
england
those
times
when
during
the
london
season
fair
ladies
and
gallant
men
might
be
seen
on
days
driving
down
st
james
street
in
grand
carriages
drawn
by
magnificent
horses
with
servants
in
cocked
hats
and
wigs
and
gold
lace
when
the
rural
villages
of
merrie
england
were
cheered
throughout
the
dreary
winter
months
by
the
sound
of
horse
and
hound
and
by
the
sight
of
beautiful
ladies
and
sportsmen
mounted
on
blood
horses
careering
over
the
country
clearing
hedges
and
ditches
of
fabulous
height
and
width
when
every
man
woman
and
child
in
the
village
turned
out
to
see
the
meet
and
the
peer
and
the
peasant
were
for
the
day
on
an
equal
footing
bound
together
by
an
extraordinary
devotion
to
the
chase
of
that
little
red
rover
which
men
called
the
fox
now
alas
extinct
as
the
mammoth
or
the
bear
owing
to
barbed
wire
and
the
abolition
of
the
horse
when
to
such
an
extent
were
games
and
sports
a
part
of
our
national
life
that
half
london
flocked
to
see
two
elevens
of
cricketers
including
a
champion
nine
feet
high
called
grace
fighting
their
mimic
battle
arrayed
in
white
flannels
and
curiously
coloured
caps
at
a
place
called
lords
the
exact
site
of
which
is
now
alas
i
lost
in
the
sea
of
houses
when
as
an
absolute
fact
the
first
news
men
turned
to
on
opening
their
daily
papers
in
the
morning
was
the
column
devoted
to
cricket
football
or
when
in
the
good
old
days
before
electricity
and
the
caused
the
finest
specimen
of
the
brute
creation
to
become
virtually
extinct
although
a
few
may
still
be
seen
at
the
zoological
gardens
for
a
cup
and
a
small
fortune
in
gold
was
only
second
to
cricket
and
football
in
the
estimation
of
all
merrie
englanders
the
only
races
now
indulged
in
being
those
of
flying
machines
to
mars
and
back
twice
a
day
two
hundred
years
hence
i
say
the
victorian
era
time
of
blessed
peace
and
unexampled
prosperity
will
be
pronounced
by
all
unprejudiced
judges
as
the
true
days
of
merrie
england
let
us
then
though
not
unmindful
of
the
past
pin
our
faith
firmly
on
the
present
and
the
future
should
be
our
motto
in
these
fleeting
times
and
above
all
progress
not
retrogression

us

for

very
seldom

i
there
at
this
period
of

but
before
going
away
for
several
months
i
bethought
me
that
i
would
go
and
inspect
the
improvements
at
the
stopping
on
my
way
at
the
jubilee
gorse
covert
we
lately
planted
to
see
if
there
is
a
litter
of
cubs
there
this
year
across
the
fields
we
go
ankle
deep
in
buttercups
and
clover
at
one
moment
then
up
the
hedge
to
avoid
treading
the
barley
we
are
so
accustomed
to
take
a
across
these
shooting
grounds
of
ours
that
we
quite
forget
that
the
farmer
would
not
thank
us
for
trampling
down
his
crops
at
the
end
of
may
but
soon
we
are
on
the
downs
well
out
of
harm
way
and
far
removed
from
highroads
and
footpaths
what
a
glorious
panorama
lies
all
around
why
do
we
not
come
here
oftener
in
summer
the
country
is
ten
times
more
lovely
then
than
it
is
in
the
shooting
season
a
field
of
sainfoin
in
june
with
its
glorious
blossoms
of
pink
is
one
of
the
prettiest
sights
in

in

distance
amid
a
setting
of
green
wheatfields
and
verdant
pastures
it
ripples
in
the
garish
light
of
the
summer
sun
like
a
lake

and

themselves
up
to
jollity
and
with
the
heart

doth
every
beast
keep
holiday
ah
there
will
be
lots
of
foxes
when
the
hounds
come
to
the
next
october
the
unpleasant
smell
at
the
mouth
of
the
earth
tells
us
that
there
are
cubs
there
and
as
we
stand
over
it
we
can
hear
them
playing
down
below
in
the
bowels
of
mother
earth
very
distinct
too
are
the
tracks
the
keeper
calls
them
leading
by

paths
to
the
dell
below
a
nice
sunny
dell
facing
where
in

the
violets
and
primroses
grow
among

cubs
were
not
born

brought
them
from

hollow

across

up

on

the

so
no

these
are
the

there
are
lots
of
rabbits
for
them
the

popping
about

wild

want
to

shrill
treble

remind
one
of
a

pigeons

a

they

has
been
no

man
tom

suddenly
appears
out
of
a
hedge
where
he
has
been
watching
the
antics
of
the
cubs
at
the
mouth
of
the
he
has
grown
very
serious
of
late
and
tells
you
repeatedly
that
there
is
going
to
be
another
big
european
war
shortly
let
us
hope
his
gloomy
forebodings
are
doomed
to
disappointment
surely
surely
at
the
end
of
this
marvellous
nineteenth
century
when
there
are
so
many
men
in
the
world
who
have
learnt
the
difficult
lessons
of
life
in
a
way
that
they
have
never
been
learnt
before
nations
are
no
longer
obliged
to
behave
like
children
or
worse
still
with
their
petty
jealousies
and
bickerings
and
growlings
like
dogs
that
delight
to
bark
and
bite
tom
peregrine
having
done
but
little
work
for
many
months
is
now
making
himself
really
useful
for
a
change
by
copying
out
parts
of
this
great
work
and
to
do
him
justice
he
writes
a
capital
clear
hand
he
is
very
anxious
to
become
secretary
to
some
great
gentleman
he
says
if
any
of
my
readers
require
a
sporting
secretary
i
can
confidently
recommend
him
as
a
man
of
plain
sense
rather
than
of
much
learning
of
a
sociable
temper
and
one
that
understands
a
little
of
backgammon
there
is
no
fear
of
his
insulting
you
with
latin
and
greek
at
your
own
table
he
would
have
suited
sir
roger
capitally
for
a
chaplain
i
often
tell
him
and
though
he
has
a
notion
who
sir
roger
may
be
he
thoroughly
enjoys
the
joke
the
presents
a
strange
appearance
it
is
full
of
young
spruce
trees
and
the
lower
branches
have
been
lopped
down
but
not
cut
through
or
killed
under
each
tree
there
is
now
a
grand
for
foxes
and
rabbits
a
sort
of
big
umbrella
turned
the
rabbits
appreciate
the
pains
we
have
been
at
but
i
fear
the
foxes
for
whom
it
was
intended
at
present
look
on
the
shelter
with
suspicion
they
dislike
the
gum
which
oozes
continually
from
the
gashes
in
the
bark
it
sticks
to
their
coats
and
gives
an
unpleasant
sensation
when
they
roll
they
can
not
keep
their
beautiful
coats
sleek
and
glossy
as
is
their
invariable
rule
as
long
as
their
is
any
gum
sticking
to
them
how
clearly
we
can
see
the
swindon
hills
in
the
bright
evening
atmosphere
they
must
be
more
than
twenty
miles
away
the
grand
old
white
horse
making
the
spot
where
long
long
ago
the
danes
were
vanquished
in
fight
is
not
visible
but
he
is
scarcely
to
be
seen
at
all
now
as
the
lazy
berkshire
people
have
neglected
their
duty
he
really
must
be
scoured
again
this
summer
he
is
a
national
institution
londoners
take
a
much
greater
interest
in
him
than
do
the
honest
folk
who
live
bang
under
his
nose
we
must
continue
our
excavations
at
ladbarrow
copse
yonder
men
say
it
is
the
largest
barrow
in
the
county
full
of
golden
coffins
and
all
sorts
of
priceless
antiquities
at
present
all
we
have
discovered
are
some
bones
with
which
we
stuffed
our
pockets
when
we
arrived
home
however
they
were
found
to
have
belonged
to
a
poor
old
that
was
buried
there
but
see
the
setting
sun
is
tinging
the
tops
of
the
slender
shapely
ash
trees
in
yonder
emerald
copse
the
whole
plain
is
changing
from
a
vast
arena
of
golden
splendour
to
a
mysterious
shadowy
land
of
dreams
a
fierce
light
still
reveals
every
object
on
the
hill
towards
the
east
but
westwards
beneath
yon
purple
ridge
all
is
wrapped
in
dim
ambiguous
shade
it
is
sad
to
think
that
i
alone
of
mortal
men
should
be
here
to
see
this
glorious
panorama
it
seems
such
a
waste
of
nature
bounteous
store
that
night
after
night
this
wondrous
spectacle
should
be
solemnly
displayed
with
no
better
gallery
than
a
stray
shepherd
who
as
he
homeward
plods
his
weary
way
cares
little
for
the
grand
drama
that
is
being
performed
entirely
for
his
benefit
nature
is
indeed
prodigal
of
her
charms
in
country
places
sometimes
whilst
walking
over
these
remote
fields
on
summer
evenings
i
have
stopped
to
ask
myself
this
question
is
it
possible
that
these
exquisite
wild
flowers
these
groves
and
dells
of
verdant
tracery
these
birds
with
their
priceless
music
and
these
wondrous
ineffable
effects
of
light
and
shade
which
form
part
of
the
everyday
pageant
of
english
rural
scenery
are
doomed
to
waste
their
sweetness
on
the
desert
air
is
it
possible
to
go
further
afield
that
those
lovely
scenes
in
wales
the
fairy
glens
near
or
the
luxuriant
valleys
of
carmarthen
further
south
where
silvery
towey
flows
below
the
stately
ruins
of
dynevor
castle
those
romantic
reaches
on
the
wye
from
chepstow
to
the
frowning
hills
of
brecon
those
solitary
but
unspeakably
grand
mountains
and
passes
of
the
highlands
such
as
glencoe
ben
nevis
or
those
of
the
scarcely
explored
hebrides
those
smiling
waters
of
the
lovely
trossachs
those
countless
spots
in
the
emerald
isle
that
the
tourist
has
never
seen
whether
in
fertile
wicklow
or
among
the
whispering
woods
and
weird
waters
of
the
west
those
gorgeous
forests
of
ceylon
those
interminable
jungles
of
the
beautiful
east
with
their
unknown
depths
of
tropical
splendour
is
it
possible
that
these
scenes
of
wondrous
beauty
are
inhabited
and
enjoyed
by
nothing
more
than
is
visible
to
our
limited
mortal
gaze
i
believed
as
a
boy
and
with
a
romance
still
unsubdued
by
time
i
would
yet
fain
believe
that
when
the
soul
of
man
escapes
from
the
poor
tenement
of
clay
in
which
it
has
been
pent
up
for
some
threescore
years
and
ten
it
has
not
far
to
go
i
would
fain
believe
that
heaven
is
not
only
above
us
but
in
some
form
or
other
entirely
beyond
our
mortal
ken
all
around
us
in
every
beautiful
thing
we
see
that
these
hills
and
vales
these
woods
of
delicately
wrought
groining
these
mazes
of
golden
light
when
the
sun
goes
down
are
peopled
not
alone
by
human
flesh
and
blood
there
are
also
terrestrial
bodies
and
bodies
celestial
but
the
glory
of
the
celestial
is
one
and
the
glory
of
the
terrestrial
is
another
who
can
imagine
the
shape
or
form
of
the
immortal
soul
as
i
walked
over
those
golden
fields
it
seemed
as
if
there
were
spirits
all
around
me
glorious
bright
spirits
of
the
dead
invisible
intangible
like
rays
of
pure
light
in
the
clear
atmosphere
of
those
elysian
fields
i
can
not
but
believe
that
there
arise
from
the
secret
parts
of
this
beautiful
earth
at
dawn
of
day
and
at
eventide
other
voices
besides
the
ineffable
songs
of
birds
the
rustling
murmurs
that
whisper
in
the
woods
and
the
plaintive
babbling
of
the
brooks
hymns
of
unknown
depths
of
harmony
impossible
to
describe
because
impossible
to
imagine
crying
night
and
day
blessing
and
honour
and
glory
and
power
be
unto
him
that
sitteth
upon
the
throne
and
unto
the
lamb
for
ever
and
ever
yes
dear
reader
though
inland
far
we
be
our
souls
have
sight
of
that
immortal
sea
which
brought
us
hither
when
the
sun
goes
down
if
you
will
turn
for
a
little
while
from
the
noise
and
clamour
of
the
busy
world
you
shall
list
to
those
voices
ringing
ringing
in
your
ears
words
of
comfort
shall
you
hear
at
eventide
and
sorrow
and
sadness
shall
be
no
more
even
though
as
the
years
roll
on
perforce
you
cry
with
wordsworth
what
though
the
radiance
which
was
once
so
bright
be
now
for
ever
taken
from
my
sight
though
nothing
can
bring
back
the
hour
of
splendour
in
the
grass
of
glory
in
the
flower
we
will
grieve
not
rather
find
strength
in
what
remains
behind
in
the
primal
sympathy
which
having
been
must
ever
be
in
the
soothing
thoughts
that
spring
out
of
human
suffering
in
the
faith
that
looks
through
death
in
years
that
bring
the
philosophic
mind

appendix
george
ridler
oven
from
the
papers
of
the
gloucestershire
it
is
now
generally
understood
that
the
words
of
this
song
have
a
hidden
meaning
which
was
only
known
to
the
members
of
the
gloucestershire
society
whose
foundation
dates
from
the
year
this
was
three
years
before
the
restoration
of
charles
ii
and
when
the
people
were
growing
weary
of
the
rule
of
oliver
cromwell
the
society
consisted
of
loyalists
whose
object
in
combining
was
to
be
prepared
to
aid
in
the
restoration
of
the
ancient
constitution
of
the
kingdom
whenever
a
favourable
opportunity
should
present
itself
the
cavalier
or
royalist
party
were
supported
by
the
roman
catholics
of
the
old
and
influential
families
of
the
kingdom
and
some
of
the
dissenters
who
were
disgusted
with
the
treatment
they
received
from
cromwell
occasionally
lent
them
a
kind
of
passive
aid
taking
these
considerations
as
the
keynote
to
the
song
attempts
have
been
made
to
discover
the
meaning
which
was
originally
attached
to
its
leading
words
it
is
difficult
at
the
present
time
to
give
a
clear
explanation
of
all
its
points
the
following
however
is
consistent
throughout
and
is
we
believe
correct
the
stwuns

oven
was
the
cavalier
party
the
stwuns
which
built
the
oven
and
which
came
out
of
the
blakeney
quaar
were
the
immediate
followers
of
the
marquis
of
worcester
who
held
out
to
the
last
steadfastly
for
the
royal
cause
at
raglan
castle
which
was
not
surrendered
till
and
was
in
fact
the
last
stronghold
retained
for
the
king
his
head
did
grow
above
his
hair
was
an
allusion
to
the
crown
the
head
of
the
state
and
which
the
king
wore
above
his

this
meant
that
the
king
before
he
died
boasted
that
notwithstanding
his
present
adversity
the
ancient
constitution
of
the
kingdom
was
so
good
and
its
vitality
so
great
that
it
would
surpass
and
outlive
any
other
form
of

republican
despotic
or

king

the
injunction
to
let
every
man
sing
in
his
own
place
was
intended
as
a
warning
to
each
of
the
three
estates
of
the
realm
to
preserve
its
proper
position
and
not
to
attempt
to
encroach
on

prerogative

well
i
lov
her
well
good
reauzon
why
because
zshe
lov
my
dog
and
i
mine
hostess
moid
was
an
allusion
to
the
queen
who
was
a
roman
catholic
and
her
maid
the
church
the
singer
we
must
suppose
was
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
party
and
his
dog
a
companion
or
faithful
official
of
the
society
and
the
song
was
sung
on
occasions
when
the
members
met
together
socially
and
thus
as
the
roman
catholics
were
royalists
the
allusion
to
the
mutual
attachment
between
the
maid
and
my
dog
and
i
is
plain
and
consistent
my
dog
has
gotten
zitch
a
trick
to

when
thauy

and
i
the
dog
that
is
the
official
or
devoted
member
of
the
society
had
a
trick
of
visiting
maids
when
they
were
sick
the
meaning
here
was
that
when
any
of
the
members
were
in
distress
or
desponding
or
likely
to
give
up
the
royal
cause
in
despair
the
officials
or
active
members
visited
consoled
and
assisted
them
my

good

i

and
i
the
dog
the
official
or
agent
of
the
society
was
good
to
catch
a
hen
a
duck
or
a
goose
that
is
any
who
were
well
affected
to
the
royal
cause
of
whatever
party
wherever
good
company
i
spy
oh
thither
go
my

and
i
to

my
mwother

i
when
i

i
did

the
strong

pwoot
that
drenk
would
pruv
my
auverdrow
and
meauk
me
wear
a
thzreadbare
cwoat
the
good
was
an
allusion
under
cover
of
a
similarity
in
the
sound
of
the
words
ale
and
aisle
to
the
church
of
which
it
was
dangerous
at
that
time
to
be
an
avowed
follower
and
so
the
members
were
cautioned
that
indiscretion
would
lead
to
their
discovery
and
overthrow
when
i
hev
dree
zixpences
under
my
thumb
oh
then
i
be
welcome
wherever
i
qeum
but
when
i
have
none
oh
then
i
pass
by
is
poverty
pearts
good
company
the
allusion
here
is
to
those
unfaithful
supporters
of
the
royal
cause
who
welcomed
the
members
of
the
society
when
it
appeared
to
be
prospering
but
parted
from
them
in
adversity
probably
referring
ironically
to
those
lukewarm
and
changeable
dissenters
who
veered
about
for
and
against
as
cromwell
favoured
or
contemned
them
such
could
always
be
had
wherever
there
were
three
the
thumb
but
poverty
easily
parted
such
good
company
when
i
gwoes
dead
as
it
may
hap
my
greauve
shall
be
under
the
good
yeal
tap
in

earmes
there
wool
us
lie
cheek
by
jowl
my
dog
and
i
if
i
should
die
an
expression
of
the
singer
wish
that
if
he
should
die
he
may
be
buried
with
his
faithful
companion
as
representing
the
principles
of
the
society
under
the
good
aisles
of
the
church
thus
evincing
his
loyalty
and
attachment
to
the
good
