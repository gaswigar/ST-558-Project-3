the

brumaire
of
louis

by
karl
marx
translator
preface
the
eighteenth
brumaire
of
louis
bonaparte
is
one
of
karl
marx
most
profound
and
most
brilliant
monographs
it
may
be
considered
the
best
work
extant
on
the
philosophy
of
history
with
an
eye
especially
upon
the
history
of
the
movement
of
the
proletariat
together
with
the
bourgeois
and
other
manifestations
that
accompany
the
same
and
the
tactics
that
such
conditions
dictate
the
recent
populist
uprising
the
more
recent
debs
movement
the
thousand
and
one
utopian
and
chimerical
notions
that
are
flaring
up
the
capitalist
maneuvers
the
hopeless
helpless
grasping
after
straws
that
characterize
the
conduct
of
the
bulk
of
the
working
class
all
of
these
together
with
the
ominous
figures
that
are
springing
into
notoriety
for
a
time
and
have
their
day
mark
the
present
period
of
the
labor
movement
in
the
nation
a
critical
one
the
best
information
acquirable
the
best
mental
training
obtainable
are
requisite
to
steer
through
the
existing
chaos
that
the
social
system
of
today
creates
all
around
us
to
aid
in
this
needed
information
and
mental
training
this
instructive
work
is
now
made
accessible
to
english
readers
and
is
commended
to
the
serious
study
of
the
serious
the
teachings
contained
in
this
work
are
hung
on
an
episode
in
recent
french
history
with
some
this
fact
may
detract
of
its
value
a
pedantic
supercilious
notion
is
extensively
abroad
among
us
that
we
are
an
anglo
saxon
nation
and
an
equally
pedantic
supercilious
habit
causes
many
to
look
to
england
for
inspiration
as
from
a
racial
birthplace
nevertheless
for
weal
or
for
woe
there
is
no
such
thing
extant
as
of
all
nations
said
to
be
in
the
united
states
least
what
we
still
have
from
england
much
as
appearances
may
seem
to
point
the
other
way
is
not
of
our
so
to
speak
but
rather
partakes
of
the
nature
of
importations
we
are
no
more
english
on
account
of
them
than
we
are
chinese
because
we
all
drink
tea
of
all
european
nations
france
is
the
on
to
which
we
come
nearest
besides
its
republican
form
of
government
the
directness
of
its
history
the
unity
of
its
actions
the
sharpness
that
marks
its
internal
development
are
all
characteristics
that
find
their
parallel
her
best
and
vice
versa
in
all
essentials
the
study
of
modern
french
history
particularly
when
sketched
by
such
a
master
hand
as
marx
is
the
most
valuable
one
for
the
acquisition
of
that
historic
social
and
biologic
insight
that
our
country
stands
particularly
in
need
of
and
that
will
be
inestimable
during
the
approaching
critical
days
for
the
assistance
of
those
who
unfamiliar
with
the
history
of
france
may
be
confused
by
some
of
the
terms
used
by
marx
the
following
explanations
may
prove
aidful
on
the
brumaire
the
development
of
affairs
in
france
enabled
the
first
napoleon
to
take
a
step
that
led
with
inevitable
certainty
to
the
imperial
throne
the
circumstance
that
fifty
and
odd
years
later
similar
events
aided
his
nephew
louis
bonaparte
to
take
a
similar
step
with
a
similar
result
gives
the
name
to
this
work
the
eighteenth
brumaire
of
louis
bonaparte
as
to
the
other
terms
and
allusions
that
occur
the
following
sketch
will
suffice
upon
the
overthrow
of
the
first
napoleon
came
the
restoration
of
the
bourbon
throne
louis

succeeded
by
charles

in
july
an
uprising
of
the
upper
tier
of
the
bourgeoisie
or
capitalist
class
the
aristocracy
of
finance
overthrew
the
bourbon
throne
or
landed
aristocracy
and
set
up
the
throne
of
orleans
a
younger
branch
of
the
house
of
bourbon
with
louis

as
king
from
the
month
in
which
this
revolution
occurred

is
called
the

a
revolt
of
a
lower
tier
of
the
capitalist
class
the
industrial
bourgeoisie
against
the
aristocracy
of

in
turn
dethroned
louis
philippe
the
affair
also
named
from
the
month
in
which
it
took
place
is
the
february
revolution
the
eighteenth
brumaire
starts
with
that
event
despite
the
inapplicableness
to
our
affairs
of
the
political
names
and
political
leadership
herein
described
both
these
names
and
leaderships
are
to
such
an
extent
the
products
of
an
development
that
has
here
too
taken
place
with
even
greater
sharpens
and
they
have
their
present
or
threatened
counterparts
here
so
completely
that
by
the
light
of
this
work
of
marx
we
are
best
enabled
to
understand
our
own
history
to
know
whence
we
came
and
whither
we
are
going
and
how
to
conduct
ourselves

he
does
not
make

out
of

by
himself
but
out
of

as
he
finds
close
at

the
tradition
of
all
past
generations
weighs
like
an
alp
upon
the
brain
of
the
living
at
the
very
time
when
men
appear
engaged
in
revolutionizing
things
and
themselves
in
bringing
about
what
never
was
before
at
such
very
epochs
of
revolutionary
crisis
do
they
anxiously
conjure
up
into
their
service
the
spirits
of
the
past
assume
their
names
their
battle
cries
their
costumes
to
enact
a
new
historic
scene
in
such
disguise
and
with
such
borrowed
language
thus
did
luther
masquerade
as
the
apostle
paul
thus
did
the
revolution
of
drape
itself
alternately
as
roman
republic
and
as
roman
empire
nor
did
the
revolution
of
know
what
better
to
do
than
to
parody
at
one
time

at
another
the
revolutionary
traditions
of
thus
does
the
beginner
who
has
acquired
a
new
language
keep
on
translating
it
back
into
his
own
mother
tongue
only
then
has
he
grasped
the
spirit
of
the
new
language
and
is
able
freely
to
express
himself
therewith
when
he
moves
in
it
without
recollections
of
the
old
and
has
forgotten
in
its
use
his
own
hereditary
tongue
when
these
historic
configurations
of
the
dead
past
are
closely
observed
a
striking
difference

in

this
society
could
no
longer
understand
that
the
ghosts
of
the
days
of
rome
had
watched
over
its
cradle
and
yet
lacking
in
heroism
as
bourgeois

is
it
nevertheless
had
stood
in
need
of
heroism
of
of
terror
of

and
of
bloody
battle

to
bring
it
into
the
world
its
gladiators
found
in
the
stern
classic
traditions
of
the
roman
republic
the
ideals
and
the
form
the
that
they
needed
in
order
to
conceal
from
themselves
the
narrow
bourgeois
substance
of
their
own
struggles
and
to
keep
their
passion
up
to
the
height
of
a
great
historic
tragedy
thus
at
another
stage
of
development
a
century
before
did
cromwell
and
the
english
people
draw
from
the
old
testament
the

passions
and
illusions
for
their
own
bourgeois
revolution
when
the
real
goal
was
reached
when
the
remodeling
of
english
society
was
accomplished

accordingly
the
reviving
of
the
dead
in
those
revolutions
served
the
purpose
of
glorifying
the
new
struggles
not
of
parodying
the
old
it
served
the
purpose
of
exaggerating
to
the
imagination
the
given
task
not
to
recoil
before
its
practical
solution
it
served
the
purpose
of
rekindling
the
revolutionary
spirit
not
to
trot
out

back
to

and
lest
there
be
any
mistake
possible
on
this
head
the
old
dates
turn
up
again
the
old
calendars
the
old
names
the
old
edicts
which
long
since
had
sunk
to
the
level
of
the
antiquarian

even
the
old

who
had
long
seemed
mouldering

englishman

imagines
he

living
in

days

on

head
behind
him
the
slave
overseer
with
a
long
whip
and
at
the
mouths
of

a
mob
of
barbarous
camp
servants
who
understand
neither
the
convicts
in
the
mines
nor
one

because
they
do
not
speak

all
this

in

make

for

in
order

pay

debts
of
the

family
sobs
the
french
nation
the
englishman
so
long
as
he
was
in
his
senses
could
not
rid
himself
of
the
rooted
thought
making
gold
the
frenchmen
so
long
as
they
were
busy
with
a
revolution
could
not
rid
then
selves
of
the
napoleonic
memory
as
the
election
of
december
proved
they
longed
to
escape
from
the
dangers
of
revolution
back
to
the
flesh
pots
of
egypt
the
of
december
was
the
answer
they
have
not
merely
the
character
of
the
old
napoleon
but
the
old
napoleon
as
he
needs
must
appear
in
the
middle
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
social
revolution
of
the
nineteenth
century
can
not
draw
its
poetry
from
the
past
it
can
draw
that
only
from
the
future
it
can
not
start
upon
its
work
before
it
has
stricken
off
all
superstition
concerning
the
past
former
revolutions
require
historic
reminiscences
in
order
to
intoxicate
themselves
with
their
own
issues
the
revolution
of
the
nineteenth
century
must
let
the
dead
bury
their
dead
in
order
to
reach
its
issue
with
the
former
the
phrase
surpasses
the
substance
with
this
one
the
substance
surpasses
the
phrase
the
february
revolution
was
a
surprisal
old
society
was
taken
unawares
and
the
people
proclaimed
this
political
stroke
a
great
historic
act
whereby
the
new
era
was
opened
on
the
of
december
the
february
revolution
is
jockeyed
by
the
trick
of
a
false
player
and
what
is
seer
to
be
overthrown
is
no
longer
the
monarchy
but
the
liberal
concessions
which
had
been
wrung
from
it
by
centuries
of
struggles
instead
of
society
itself
having
conquered
a
new
point
only
the
state
appears
to
have
returned
to
its
oldest
form
to
the
simply
brazen
rule
of
the
sword
and
the
club
thus
upon
the
coup
de
main
of
february
comes
the
response
of
the
coup
de
tete
december
so
won
so
lost
meanwhile
the
interval
did
not
go
by
unutilized
during
the
years
french
society
retrieved
in
abbreviated
because
revolutionary
method
the
lessons
and
teachings
which
if
it
was
to
be
more
than
a
disturbance
of
the
have
preceded
the
february
revolution
had
it
developed
in
regular
order
by
rule
so
to
say
now
french
society
seems
to
have
receded
behind
its
point
of
departure
in
fact
however
it
was
compelled
to
first
produce
its
own
revolutionary
point
of
departure
the
situation
circumstances
conditions
under
which
alone
the
modern
revolution
is
in
earnest
bourgeois
revolutions
like
those
of
the
eighteenth
century
rush
onward
rapidly
from
success
to
success
their
stage
effects
outbid
one
another
men
and
things
seem
to
be
set
in
flaming
brilliants
ecstasy
is
the
prevailing
spirit
but
they
are
they
reach
their
climax
speedily
then
society
relapses
into
a
long
fit
of
nervous
reaction
before
it
learns
how
to
appropriate
the
fruits
of
its
period
of
feverish
excitement
proletarian
revolutions
on
the
contrary
such
as
those
of
the
nineteenth
century
criticize
themselves
constantly
constantly
interrupt
themselves
in
their
own
course
come
back
to
what
seems
to
have
been
accomplished
in
order
to
start
over
anew
scorn
with
cruel
thoroughness
the
half
measures
weaknesses
and
meannesses
of
their
first
attempts
seem
to
throw
down
their
adversary
only
in
order
to
enable
him
to
draw
fresh
strength
from
the
earth
and
again
to
rise
up
against
them
in
more
gigantic
stature
constantly
recoil
in
fear
before
the
undefined
monster
magnitude
of
their
own
objects
until
finally
that
situation
is
created
which
renders
all
retreat
impossible
and
the
conditions
themselves
cry
out
hic

here

an
allusion
to
aesop
fables
every
observer
of
average
intelligence
even
if
he
failed
to
follow
step
by
step
the
course
of
french
development
must
have
anticipated
that
an
unheard
of
fiasco
was
in
store
for
the
revolution
it
was
enough
to
hear
the
yelpings
of
victory
wherewith
the
messieurs
democrats
mutually
congratulated
one
another
upon
the
pardons
of
may
indeed
may
had
become
a
fixed
idea
in
their
heads
it
had
become
a
dogma
with
them
something
like
the
day
on
which
christ
was
to
reappear
and
the
millennium
to
begin
had
formed
in
the
heads
of
the
chiliasts
weakness
had
as
it
ever
does
taken
refuge
in
the
wonderful
it
believed
the
enemy
was
overcome
if
in
its
imagination
it
him
away
and
it
lost
all
sense
of
the
present
in
the
imaginary
apotheosis
of
the
future
that
was
at
hand
and
of
the
deeds
that
it
had
in
petto
but
which
it
did
not
yet
want
to
bring
to
the
scratch
the
heroes
who
ever
seek
to
refute
their
established
incompetence
by
mutually
bestowing
their
sympathy
upon
one
another
and
by
pulling
together
had
packed
their
satchels
taken
their
laurels
in
advance
payments
and
were
just
engaged
in
the
work
of
getting
discounted
in
partibus
on
the
stock
exchange
the
republics
for
which
in
the
silence
of
their
unassuming
dispositions
they
had
carefully
organized
the
government
personnel
the
of
december
struck
them
like
a
bolt
from
a
clear
sky
and
the
who
in
periods
of
timid
despondency
gladly
allow
their
hidden
fears
to
be
drowned
by
the
loudest
screamers
will
perhaps
have
become
convinced
that
the
days
are
gone
by
when
the
cackling
of
geese
could
save
the
capitol
the
constitution
the
national
assembly
the
dynastic
parties
the
blue
and
the
red
republicans
the
heroes
from
africa
the
thunder
from
the
tribune
the
from
the
daily
press
the
whole
literature
the
political
names
and
the
intellectual
celebrities
the
civil
and
the
criminal
law
the
liberte
egalite
fraternite
together
with
the
of
may
all
vanished
like
a
phantasmagoria
before
the
ban
of
one
man
whom
his
enemies
themselves
do
not
pronounce
an
adept
at
witchcraft
universal
suffrage
seems
to
have
survived
only
for
a
moment
to
the
end
that
before
the
eyes
of
the
whole
world
it
should
make
its
own
testament
with
its
own
hands
and
in
the
name
of
the
people
declare
all
that
exists
deserves
to
perish
it
is
not
enough
to
say
as
the
frenchmen
do
that
their
nation
was
taken
by
surprise
a
nation
no
more
than
a
woman
is
excused
for
the
unguarded
hour
when
the
first
adventurer
who
comes
along
can
do
violence
to
her
the
riddle
is
not
solved
by
such
shifts
it
is
only
formulated
in
other
words
there
remains
to
be
explained
how
a
nation
of
millions
can
be
surprised
by
three
swindlers
and
taken
to
prison
without
resistance
let
us
recapitulate
in
general
outlines
the
phases
which
the
french
revolution
of
february
to
december
ran
through
three
main
periods
are
unmistakable
first
the
february
period
second
the
period
of
constituting
the
republic
or
of
the
constitutive
national
assembly
may
to
may
third
the
period
of
the
constitutional
republic
or
of
the
legislative
national
assembly
may
to
december
the
first
period
from
february
or
the
downfall
of
louis
philippe
to
may
the
date
of
the
assembling
of
the
constitutive
assembly
the
february
period
proper
may
be
designated
as
the
prologue
of
the
revolution
it
officially
expressed
its
own
character
in
this
that
the
government
which
it
improvised
declared
itself
provisional
and
like
the
government
everything
that
was
broached
attempted
or
uttered
pronounced
itself
provisional
nobody
and
nothing
dared
to
assume
the
right
of
permanent
existence
and
of
an
actual
fact
all
the
elements
that
had
prepared
or
determined
the
revolution
dynastic
opposition
republican
bourgeoisie
small
class
labor
found
provisionally
their
place
in
the
february
government
it
could
not
be
otherwise
the
february
days
contemplated
originally
a
reform
of
the
suffrage
laws
whereby
the
area
of
the
politically
privileged
among
the
class
was
to
be
extended
while
the
exclusive
rule
of
the
aristocracy
of
finance
was
to
be
overthrown
when
however
it
came
to
a
real
conflict
when
the
people
mounted
the
barricades
when
the
national
guard
stood
passive
when
the
army
offered
no
serious
resistance
and
the
kingdom
ran
away
then
the
republic
seemed
each
party
interpreted
it
in
its
own
sense
won
arms
in
hand
by
the
proletariat
they
put
upon
it
the
stamp
of
their
own
class
and
proclaimed
the
social
republic
thus
the
general
purpose
of
modern
revolutions
was
indicated
a
purpose
however
that
stood
in
most
singular
contradiction
to
every
thing
that
with
the
material
at
hand
with
the
stage
of
enlightenment
that
the
masses
had
reached
and
under
existing
circumstances
and
conditions
could
be
immediately
used
on
the
other
hand
the
claims
of
all
the
other
elements
that
had
cooperated
in
the
revolution
of
february
were
recognized
by
the
share
that
they
received
in
the
government
hence
in
no
period
do
we
find
a
more
motley
mixture
of
phrases
together
with
actual
doubt
and
helplessness
of
more
enthusiastic
reform
aspirations
together
with
a
more
slavish
adherence
to
the
old
routine
more
seeming
harmony
permeating
the
whole
of
society
together
with
a
deeper
alienation
of
its
several
elements
while
the
parisian
proletariat
was
still
gloating
over
the
sight
of
the
great
perspective
that
had
disclosed
itself
to
their
view
and
was
indulging
in
seriously
meant
discussions
over
the
social
problems
the
old
powers
of
society
had
groomed
themselves
had
gathered
together
had
deliberated
and
found
an
unexpected
support
in
the
mass
of
the
nation
the
peasants
and
small
traders
all
of
whom
threw
themselves
on
a
sudden
upon
the
political
stage
after
the
barriers
of
the
july
monarchy
had
fallen
down
the
second
period
from
may
to
the
end
of
may
is
the
period
of
the
constitution
of
the
founding
of
the
bourgeois
republic
immediately
after
the
february
days
not
only
was
the
dynastic
opposition
surprised
by
the
republicans
and
the
republicans
by
the
socialists
but
all
france
was
surprised
by
paris
the
national
assembly
that
met
on
may
to
frame
a
constitution
was
the
outcome
of
the
national
elections
it
represented
the
nation
it
was
a
living
protest
against
the
assumption
of
the
february
days
and
it
was
intended
to
bring
the
results
of
the
revolution
back
to
the
bourgeois
measure
in
vain
did
the
proletariat
of
paris
which
forthwith
understood
the
character
of
this
national
assembly
endeavor
a
few
days
after
its
meeting
on
may
to
deny
its
existence
by
force
to
dissolve
it
to
disperse
the
organic
apparition
in
which
the
reacting
spirit
of
the
nation
was
threatening
them
and
thus
reduce
it
back
to
its
separate
component
parts
as
is
known
the
of
may
had
no
other
result
than
that
of
removing
blanqui
and
his
associates
the
real
leaders
of
the
proletarian
party
from
the
public
scene
for
the
whole
period
of
the
cycle
which
we
are
here
considering
upon
the
bourgeois
monarchy
of
louis
philippe
only
the
bourgeois
republic
could
follow
that
is
to
say
a
limited
portion
of
the
bourgeoisie
having
ruled
under
the
name
of
the
king
now
the
whole
bourgeoisie
was
to
rule
under
the
name
of
the
people
the
demands
of
the
parisian
proletariat
are
utopian
that
have
to
be
done
away
with
to
this
declaration
of
the
constitutional
national
assembly
the
paris
proletariat
answers
with
the
june
insurrection
the
most
colossal
event
in
the
history
of
european
civil
wars
the
bourgeois
republic
won
on
its
side
stood
the
aristocracy
of
finance
the
industrial
bourgeoisie
the
middle
class
the
small
traders
class
the
army
the
slums
organized
as
guarde
mobile
the
intellectual
celebrities
the
parsons
class
and
the
rural
population
on
the
side
of
the
parisian
proletariat
stood
none
but
itself
over
insurgents
were
massacred
after
the
victory
were
transported
without
trial
with
this
defeat
the
proletariat
steps
to
the
background
on
the
revolutionary
stage
it
always
seeks
to
crowd
forward
so
soon
as
the
movement
seems
to
acquire
new
impetus
but
with
ever
weaker
effort
and
ever
smaller
results
so
soon
as
any
of
the
above
lying
layers
of
society
gets
into
revolutionary
fermentation
it
enters
into
alliance
therewith
and
thus
shares
all
the
defeats
which
the
several
parties
successively
suffer
but
these
succeeding
blows
become
ever
weaker
the
more
generally
they
are
distributed
over
the
whole
surface
of
society
the
more
important
leaders
of
the
proletariat
in
its
councils
and
the
press
fall
one
after
another
victims
of
the
courts
and
ever
more
questionable
figures
step
to
the
front
it
partly
throws
itself
it
upon
doctrinaire
experiments
banking
and
labor
exchange
schemes
in
other
words
movements
in
which
it
goes
into
movements
in
which
it
gives
up
the
task
of
revolutionizing
the
old
world
with
its
own
large
collective
weapons
and
on
the
contrary
seeks
to
bring
about
its
emancipation
behind
the
back
of
society
in
private
ways
within
the
narrow
bounds
of
its
own
class
conditions
and
consequently
inevitably
fails
the
proletariat
seems
to
be
able
neither
to
find
again
the
revolutionary
magnitude
within
itself
nor
to
draw
new
energy
from
the
newly
formed
alliances
until
all
the
classes
with
whom
it
contended
in
june
shall
lie
prostrate
along
with
itself
but
in
all
these
defeats
the
proletariat
succumbs
at
least
with
the
honor
that
attaches
to
great
historic
struggles
not
france
alone
all
europe
trembles
before
the
june
earthquake
while
the
successive
defeats
inflicted
upon
the
higher
classes
are
bought
so
easily
that
they
need
the
brazen
exaggeration
of
the
victorious
party
itself
to
be
at
all
able
to
pass
muster
as
an
event
and
these
defeats
become
more
disgraceful
the
further
removed
the
defeated
party
stands
from
the
proletariat
true
enough
the
defeat
of
the
june
insurgents
prepared
leveled
the
ground
upon
which
the
bourgeois
republic
could
be
founded
and
erected
but
it
at
the
same
time
showed
that
there
are
in
europe
other
issues
besides
that
of
republic
or
monarchy
it
revealed
the
fact
that
here
the
bourgeois
republic
meant
the
unbridled
despotism
of
one
class
over
another
it
proved
that
with
nations
enjoying
an
older
civilization
having
developed
class
distinctions
modern
conditions
of
production
an
intellectual
consciousness
wherein
all
traditions
of
old
have
been
dissolved
through
the
work
of
centuries
that
with
such
countries
the
republic
means
only
the
political
revolutionary
form
of
bourgeois
society
not
its
conservative
form
of
existence
as
is
the
case
in
the
united
states
of
america
where
true
enough
the
classes
already
exist
but
have
not
yet
acquired
permanent
character
are
in
constant
flux
and
reflux
constantly
changing
their
elements
and
yielding
them
up
to
one
another
where
the
modern
means
of
production
instead
of
coinciding
with
a
stagnant
population
rather
compensate
for
the
relative
scarcity
of
heads
and
hands
and
finally
where
the
feverishly
youthful
life
of
material
production
which
has
to
appropriate
a
new
world
to
itself
has
so
far
left
neither
time
nor
opportunity
to
abolish
the
illusions
of
old
this
was
written
at
the
beginning
of
all
classes
and
parties
joined
hands
in
the
june
days
in
a
party
of
order
against
the
class
of
the
proletariat
which
was
designated
as
the
party
of
anarchy
of
socialism
of
communism
they
claimed
to
have
saved
society
against
the
enemies
of
society
they
gave
out
the
slogans
of
the
old
social
order
property
family
religion
order
as
the
passwords
for
their
army
and
cried
out
to
the
crusaders
in
this
sign
thou
wilt
conquer
from
that
moment
on
so
soon
as
any
of
the
numerous
parties
which
had
marshaled
themselves
under
this
sign
against
the
june
insurgents
tries
in
turn
to
take
the
revolutionary
field
in
the
interest
of
its
own
class
it
goes
down
in
its
turn
before
the
cry
property
family
religion
order
thus
it
happens
that
society
is
saved
as
often
as
the
circle
of
its
ruling
class
is
narrowed
as
often
as
a
more
exclusive
interest
asserts
itself
over
the
general
every
demand
for
the
most
simple
bourgeois
financial
reform
for
the
most
ordinary
liberalism
for
the
most
commonplace
republicanism
for
the
flattest
democracy
is
forthwith
punished
as
an
assault
upon
society
and
is
branded
as
socialism
finally
the
high
priests
of
religion
and
order
themselves
are
kicked
off
their
tripods
are
fetched
out
of
their
beds
in
the
dark
hurried
into
patrol
wagons
thrust
into
jail
or
sent
into
exile
their
temple
is
razed
to
the
ground
their
mouths
are
sealed
their
pen
is
broken
their
law
torn
to
pieces
in
the
name
of
religion
of
family
of
property
and
of
order
bourgeois
fanatic
on
the
point
of
order
are
shot
down
on
their
own
balconies
by
drunken
soldiers
forfeit
their
family
property
and
their
houses
are
bombarded
for
pastime
all
in
the
name
of
property
of
family
of
religion
and
of
order
finally
the
refuse
of
bourgeois
society
constitutes
the
holy
phalanx
of
order
and
the
hero
crapulinsky
makes
his
entry
into
the
tuileries
as
the
savior
of
society
ii
let
us
resume
the
thread
of
events
the
history
of
the
constitutional
national
assembly
from
the
june
days
on
is
the
history
of
the
supremacy
and
dissolution
of
the
republican
bourgeois
party
the
party
which
is
known
under
several
names
of
tricolor
republican
true
republican
political
republican
formal
republican
etc
under
the
bourgeois
monarchy
of
louis
philippe
this
party
had
constituted
the
official
republican
opposition
and
consequently
had
been
a
recognized
element
in
the
then
political
world
it
had
its
representatives
in
the
chambers
and
commanded
considerable
influence
in
the
press
its
parisian
organ
the
national
passed
in
its
way
for
as
respectable
a
paper
as
the
journal
des
debats
this
position
in
the
constitutional
monarchy
corresponded
to
its
character
the
party
was
not
a
fraction
of
the
bourgeoisie
held
together
by
great
and
common
interests
and
marked
by
special
business
requirements
it
was
a
coterie
of
bourgeois
with
republican
lawyers
officers
and
civil
employees
whose
influence
rested
upon
the
personal
antipathies
of
the
country
for
louis
philippe
upon
reminiscences
of
the
old
republic
upon
the
republican
faith
of
a
number
of
enthusiasts
and
above
all
upon
the
spirit
of
french
patriotism
whose
hatred
of
the
treaties
of
vienna
and
of
the
alliance
with
england
kept
them
perpetually
on
the
alert
the
national
owed
a
large
portion
of
its
following
under
louis
philippe
to
this
covert
imperialism
that
later
under
the
republic
could
stand
up
against
it
as
a
deadly
competitor
in
the
person
of
louis
bonaparte
the
fought
the
aristocracy
of
finance
just
the
same
as
did
the
rest
of
the
bourgeois
opposition
the
polemic
against
the
budget
which
in
france
was
closely
connected
with
the
opposition
to
the
aristocracy
of
finance
furnished
too
cheap
a
popularity
and
too
rich
a
material
for
puritanical
leading
articles
not
to
be
exploited
the
industrial
bourgeoisie
was
thankful
to
it
for
its
servile
defense
of
the
french
tariff
system
which
however
the
paper
had
taken
up
more
out
of
patriotic
than
economic
reasons
the
whole
bourgeois
class
was
thankful
to
it
for
its
vicious
denunciations
of
communism
and
socialism
for
the
rest
the
party
of
the
national
was
purely
republican
it
demanded
a
republican
instead
of
a
monarchic
form
of
bourgeois
government
above
all
it
demanded
for
the
bourgeoisie
the
lion
share
of
the
government
as
to
how
this
transformation
was
to
be
accomplished
the
party
was
far
from
being
clear
what
however
was
clear
as
day
to
it
and
was
openly
declared
at
the
reform
banquets
during
the
last
days
of
louis
philippe
reign
was
its
unpopularity
with
the
democratic
middle
class
especially
with
the
revolutionary
proletariat
these
pure
republicans
as
pure
republicans
go
were
at
first
on
the
very
point
of
contenting
themselves
with
the
regency
of
the
duchess
of
orleans
when
the
february
revolution
broke
out
and
when
it
gave
their
best
known
representatives
a
place
in
the
provisional
government
of
course
they
enjoyed
from
the
start
the
confidence
of
the
bourgeoisie
and
of
the
majority
of
the
constitutional
national
assembly
the
socialist
elements
of
the
provisional
government
were
promptly
excluded
from
the
executive
committee
which
the
assembly
had
elected
upon
its
convening
and
the
party
of
the
national
subsequently
utilized
the
outbreak
of
the
june
insurrection
to
dismiss
this
executive
committee
also
and
thus
rid
itself
of
its
nearest
rivals
the
small
traders
class
or
democratic
republicans
cavaignac
the
general
of
the
bourgeois
republican
party
who
command
at
the
battle
of
june
stepped
into
the
place
of
the
executive
committee
with
a
sort
of
dictatorial
power
marrast
former
of
the
national
became
permanent
president
of
the
constitutional
national
assembly
and
the
secretaryship
of
state
together
with
all
the
other
important
posts
devolved
upon
the
pure
republicans
the
republican
bourgeois
party
which
since
long
had
looked
upon
itself
as
the
legitimate
heir
of
the
july
monarchy
thus
found
itself
surpassed
in
its
own
ideal
but
it
cam
to
power
not
as
it
had
dreamed
under
louis
philippe
through
a
liberal
revolt
of
the
bourgeoisie
against
the
throne
but
through
a
mutiny
of
the
proletariat
against
capital
that
which
it
imagined
to
be
the
most
revolutionary
came
about
as
the
most
event
the
fruit
fell
into
its
lap
but
it
fell
from
the
tree
of
knowledge
not
from
the
tree
of
life
the
exclusive
power
of
the
bourgeois
republic
lasted
only
from
june
to
the
of
december
it
is
summed
up
in
the
framing
of
a
republican
constitution
and
in
the
state
of
siege
of
paris
the
new
constitution
was
in
substance
only
a
republicanized
edition
of
the
constitutional
charter
of
the
limited
suffrage
of
the
july
monarchy
which
excluded
even
a
large
portion
of
the
bourgeoisie
from
political
power
was
irreconcilable
with
the
existence
of
the
bourgeois
republic
the
february
revolution
had
forthwith
proclaimed
direct
and
universal
suffrage
in
place
of
the
old
law
the
bourgeois
republic
could
not
annul
this
act
they
had
to
content
themselves
with
tacking
to
it
the
limitation
a
six
months
residence
the
old
organization
of
the
administrative
law
of
municipal
government
of
court
procedures
of
the
army
remained
untouched
or
where
the
constitution
did
change
them
the
change
affected
their
index
not
their
subject
their
name
not
their
substance
the
inevitable
general
staff
of
the
freedoms
of
personal
freedom
freedom
of
the
press
of
speech
of
association
and
of
assemblage
freedom
of
instruction
of
religion
received
a
constitutional
uniform
that

each
of
these
freedoms
is
proclaimed
the
absolute
right
of
the
french
citizen

always
with
the
gloss
that
it
is
unlimited
in
so

only
as
it
be
not

by

equal
rights
of

by

by

are

this

for

citizens
have
the
right
of
association
of
peaceful
and
unarmed
assemblage
of
petitioning
and
of
expressing
their
opinions
through
the
press
or

the

has

than

the

constantly
alludes
to
future
organic

that
are
to
carry
out
the
glosses
and
are
intended
to
regulate
the

of

to
the

that
they
collide
neither

later

are
called
into
existence
by
the
friends

and
all
the
above
named
freedoms
are
so
regulated
that
in
their
enjoyment
the
bourgeoisie
encounter
no
opposition
from
the
like
rights
of
the
other
classes
wherever
the
bourgeoisie
wholly
interdicted
these

to

allowed
them
their

were

so
many

snares
it
was
always
done
only
in
the
interest
of
the
public
safety
of
the
bourgeoisie
as
required
by
the
constitution
hence
it
comes
that
both
friends
of
order
who
abolished
all
those
freedoms
as
well
as
the
democrats
who
had
demanded
them
all
appeal
with
full
right
to
the
constitution
each
paragraph
of
the
constitution
contains
its
own
antithesis
its
own
upper
and
lower
as
a
generalization
the
abolition
of
freedom
as
a
specification
accordingly
so
long
as
the
name
of
freedom
was
respected
and
only
its
real
enforcement
was
prevented
in
a
legal
way
of
course
the
constitutional
existence
of
freedom
remained
uninjured
untouched
however
completely
its
common
existence
might
be
extinguished
this
constitution
so
ingeniously
made
invulnerable
was
however
like
achilles
vulnerable
at
one
point
not
in
its
heel
but
in
its
head
or
rather
in
the
two
heads
into
which
it
ran
legislative
assembly
on
the
one
hand
and
the
president
on
the
other
run
through
the
constitution
and
it
will
be
found
that
only
those
paragraphs
wherein
the
relation
of
the
president
to
the
legislative
assembly
is
defined
are
absolute
positive
uncontradictory
undistortable
here
the
bourgeois
republicans
were
concerned
in
securing
their
own
position
articles
of
the
constitution
are
so
framed
that
the
national
assembly
can
constitutionally
remove
the
president
but
the
president
can
set
aside
the
national
assembly
only
unconstitutionally
he
can
set
it
aside
only
by
setting
aside
the
constitution
itself
accordingly
by
these
provisions
the
national
assembly
challenges
its
own
violent
destruction
it
not
only
consecrates
like
the
character
of
the
division
of
powers
but
it
extends
this
feature
to
an
unbearably
contradictory
extreme
the
play
of
constitutional
powers
as
guizot
styled
the
between
the
legislative
and
the
executive
powers
plays
permanent
vabanque
in
the
constitution
of
on
the
one
side
representatives
of
the
people
elected
and
qualified
for
by
universal
suffrage
who
constitute
an
uncontrollable
indissoluble
indivisible
national
assembly
a
national
assembly
that
enjoys
legislative
omnipotence
that
decides
in
the
last
instance
over
war
peace
and
commercial
treaties
that
alone
has
the
power
to
grant
amnesties
and
that
through
its
perpetuity
continually
maintains
the
foreground
on
the
stage
on
the
other
a
president
clad
with
all
the
attributes
of
royalty
with
the
right
to
appoint
and
remove
his
ministers
independently
from
the
national
assembly
holding
in
his
hands
all
the
means
of
executive
power
the
dispenser
of
all
posts
and
thereby
the
arbiter
of
at
least
one
and
a
half
million
existences
in
france
so
many
being
dependent
upon
the
civil
employees
and
upon
the
officers
of
all
grades
he
has
the
whole
armed
power
behind
him
he
enjoys
the
privilege
of
granting
pardons
to
individual
criminals
suspending
the
national
guards
of
removing
with
the
consent
of
the
council
of
state
the
general
cantonal
and
municipal
councilmen
elected
by
the
citizens
themselves
the
initiative
and
direction
of
all
negotiations
with
foreign
countries
are
reserved
to
him
while
the
assembly
itself
is
constantly
acting
upon
the
stage
and
is
exposed
to
the
critically
vulgar
light
of
day
he
leads
a
hidden
life
in
the
elysian
fields
only
with
article
of
the
constitution
before
his
eyes
and
in
his
heart
daily
calling
out
to
him
frere
il
faut
mourir
brother
you
must
die
your
power
expires
on
the
second
sunday
of
the
beautiful
month
of
may
in
the
fourth
year
after
your
election
the
glory
is
then
at
an
end
the
play
is
not
performed
twice
and
if
you
have
any
debts
see
to
it
betimes
that
you
pay
them
off
with
the
francs
that
the
constitution
has
set
aside
for
you
unless
perchance
you
should
prefer
traveling
to
clichy
the
debtors
prison
on
the
second
monday
of
the
beautiful
month
of
may
while
the
constitution
thus
clothes
the
president
with
actual
power
it
seeks
to
secure
the
moral
power
to
the
national
assembly
apart
from
the
circumstance
that
it
is
impossible
to
create
a
moral
power
through
legislative
paragraphs
the
constitution
again
neutralizes
itself
in
that
it
causes
the
president
to
be
chosen
by
all
the
frenchmen
through
direct
suffrage
while
the
votes
of
france
are
splintered
to
pieces
upon
the
members
of
the
national
assembly
they
are
here
on
the
contrary
concentrated
upon
one
individual
while
each
separate
representative
represents
only
this
or
that
party
this
or
that
city
this
or
that
dunghill
or
possibly
only
the
necessity
of
electing
some
one
or
other
with
whom
neither
the
issue
nor
the
man
is
closely
considered
that
one
the
president
on
the
contrary
is
the
elect
of
the
nation
and
the
act
of
his
election
is
the
trump
card
that
the
sovereign
people
plays
out
once
every
four
years
the
elected
national
assembly
stands
in
a
metaphysical
but
the
elected
president
in
a
personal
relation
to
the
nation
true
enough
the
national
assembly
presents
in
its
several
representatives
the
various
sides
of
the
national
spirit
but
in
the
president
this
spirit
is
incarnated
as
against
the
national
assembly
the
president
possesses
a
sort
of
divine
right
he
is
by
the
grace
of
the
people
thetis
the
had
prophesied
to
achilles
that
he
would
die
in
the
bloom
of
youth
the
constitution
which
had
its
weak
spot
like
achilles
had
also
like
achilles
the
presentiment
that
it
would
depart
by
premature
death
it
was
enough
for
the
pure
republicans
engaged
at
the
work
of
framing
a
constitution
to
cast
a
glance
from
the
misty
heights
of
their
ideal
republic
down
upon
the
profane
world
in
order
to
realize
how
the
arrogance
of
the
royalists
of
the
bonapartists
of
the
democrats
of
the
communists
rose
daily
together
with
their
own
discredit
and
in
the
same
measure
as
they
approached
the
completion
of
their
legislative
work
of
art
without
thetis
having
for
this
purpose
to
leave
the
sea
and
impart
the
secret
to
them
they
ought
to
outwit
fate
by
means
of
constitutional
artifice
through
section
of
the
constitution
according
to
which
every
motion
to
revise
the
constitution
had
to
be
discussed
three
successive
times
between
each
of
which
a
full
month
was
to
elapse
and
required
at
least
a
majority
with
the
additional
proviso
that
not
less
than
members
of
the
national
assembly
voted
they
thereby
only
made
the
impotent
attempt
still
to
exercise
as
a
parliamentary
minority
to
which
in
their
mind
eye
they
prophetically
saw
themselves
reduced
a
power
that
at
this
very
time
when
they
still
disposed
over
the
parliamentary
majority
and
over
all
the
machinery
of
government
was
daily
slipping
from
their
weak
hands
finally
the
constitution
entrusts
itself
for
safe
keeping
in
a
melodramatic
paragraph
to
the
watchfulness
and
patriotism
of
the
whole
french
people
and
of
each
individual
frenchman
after
having
just
before
in
another
paragraph
entrusted
the
watchful
and
the
patriotic
themselves
to
the
tender
inquisitorial
attention
of
the
high
court
instituted
by
itself
that
was
the
constitution
of
which
on
the
of
december
was
not
overthrown
by
one
head
but
tumbled
down
at
the
touch
of
a
mere
hat
though
true
enough
that
hat
was
a
napoleon
hat
while
the
bourgeois
republicans
were
engaged
in
the
assembly
with
the
work
of
splicing
this
constitution
of
discussing
and
voting
cavaignac
on
the
outside
maintained
the
state
of
siege
of
paris
the
state
of
siege
of
paris
was
the
midwife
of
the
constitutional
assembly
during
its
republican
pains
of
travail
when
the
constitution
is
later
on
swept
off
the
earth
by
the
bayonet
it
should
not
be
forgotten
that
it
was
by
the
bayonet
likewise
and
the
bayonet
turned
against
the
people
at
that
that
it
had
to
be
protected
in
its
mother
womb
and
that
by
the
bayonet
it
had
to
be
planted
on
earth
the
ancestors
of
these
honest
republicans
had
caused
their
symbol
the
tricolor
to
make
the
tour
of
europe
these
in
their
turn
also
made
a
discovery
which
all
of
itself
found
its
way
over
the
whole
continent
but
with
ever
renewed
love
came
back
to
france
until
by
this
time
if
had
acquired
the
right
of
citizenship
in
of
her
departments
the
state
of
siege
a
wondrous
discovery
this
was
periodically
applied
at
each
succeeding
crisis
in
the
course
of
the
french
revolution
but
the
barrack
and
the
bivouac
thus
periodically
laid
on
the
head
of
french
society
to
compress
her
brain
and
reduce
her
to
quiet
the
sabre
and
the
musket
periodically
made
to
perform
the
functions
of
judges
and
of
administrators
of
guardians
and
of
censors
of
police
officers
and
of
watchmen
the
military
moustache
and
the
soldier
jacket
periodically
heralded
as
the
highest
wisdom
and
guiding
stars
of
society
were
not
all
of
these
the
barrack
and
the
bivouac
the
sabre
and
the
musket
the
moustache
and
the
soldier
jacket
bound
in
the
end
to
hit
upon
the
idea
that
they
might
as
well
save
society
once
for
all
by
proclaiming
their
own
regime
as
supreme
and
relieve
bourgeois
society
wholly
of
the
care
of
ruling
itself
the
barrack
and
the
bivouac
the
sabre
and
the
musket
the
moustache
and
the
soldier
jacket
were
all
the
more
bound
to
hit
upon
this
idea
seeing
that
they
could
then
also
expect
better
cash
payment
for
their
increased
deserts
while
at
the
merely
periodic
states
of
siege
and
the
transitory
savings
of
society
at
the
behest
of
this
or
that
bourgeois
faction
very
little
solid
matter
fell
to
them
except
some
dead
and
wounded
besides
some
friendly
bourgeois
grimaces
should
not
the
military
finally
in
and
for
its
own
interest
play
the
game
of
state
of
siege
and
simultaneously
besiege
the
bourgeois
exchanges
moreover
it
must
not
be
forgotten
and
be
it
observed
in
passing
that
bernard
the
same
president
of
the
military
committee
who
under
cavaignac
helped
to
deport
insurgents
without
trial
moves
at
this
period
again
at
the
head
of
the
military
committees
now
active
in
paris
although
the
honest
the
pure
republicans
built
with
the
state
of
siege
the
nursery
in
which
the
praetorian
guards
of
december
were
to
be
reared
they
on
the
other
hand
deserve
praise
in
that
instead
of
exaggerating
the
feeling
of
patriotism
as
under
louis
philippe
now
they
themselves
are
in
command
of
the
national
power
they
crawl
before
foreign
powers
instead
of
making
italy
free
they
allow
her
to
be
reconquered
by
austrians
and
neapolitans
the
election
of
louis
bonaparte
for
president
on
december
put
an
end
to
the
dictatorship
of
cavaignac
and
to
the
constitutional
assembly
in
article
of
the
constitution
it
is
said
the
president
of
the
french
republic
must
never
have
lost
his
status
as
a
french
citizen
the
first
president
of
the
french
republic
bonaparte
had
not
only
lost
his
status
as
a
french
citizen
had
not
only
been
an
english
special
constable
but
was
even
a
naturalized
swiss
citizen
in
the
previous
chapter
i
have
explained
the
meaning
of
the
election
of
december
i
shall
not
here
return
to
it
suffice
it
here
to
say
that
it
was
a
reaction
of
the
farmers
class
who
had
been
expected
to
pay
the
costs
of
the
february
revolution
against
the
other
classes
of
the
nation
it
was
a
reaction
of
the
country
against
the
city
it
met
with
great
favor
among
the
soldiers
to
whom
the
republicans
of
the
national
had
brought
neither
fame
nor
funds
among
the
great
bourgeoisie
who
hailed
bonaparte
as
a
bridge
to
the
monarchy
and
among
the
proletarians
and
small
traders
who
hailed
him
as
a
scourge
to
cavaignac
i
shall
later
have
occasion
to
enter
closer
into
the
relation
of
the
farmers
to
the
french
revolution
the
epoch
between
december
and
the
dissolution
of
the
constitutional
assembly
in
may
embraces
the
history
of
the
downfall
of
the
bourgeois
republicans
after
they
had
founded
a
republic
for
the
bourgeoisie
had
driven
the
revolutionary
proletariat
from
the
field
and
had
meanwhile
silenced
the
democratic
middle
class
they
are
themselves
shoved
aside
by
the
mass
of
the
bourgeoisie
who
justly
appropriate
this
republic
as
their
property
this
bourgeois
mass
was
royalist
however
a
part
thereof
the
large
landed
proprietors
had
ruled
under
the
restoration
hence
was
legitimist
the
other
part
the
aristocrats
of
finance
and
the
large
industrial
capitalists
had
ruled
under
the
july
monarchy
hence
was
orleanist
the
high
functionaries
of
the
army
of
the
university
of
the
church
in
the
civil
service
of
the
academy
and
of
the
press
divided
themselves
on
both
sides
although
in
unequal
parts
here
in
the
bourgeois
republic
that
bore
neither
the
name
of
bourbon
nor
of
orleans
but
the
name
of
capital
they
had
found
the
form
of
government
under
which
they
could
all
rule
in
common
already
the
june
insurrection
had
united
them
all
into
a
party
of
order
the
next
thing
to
do
was
to
remove
the
bourgeois
republicans
who
still
held
the
seats
in
the
national
assembly
as
brutally
as
these
pure
republicans
had
abused
their
own
physical
power
against
the
people
so
cowardly
disheartened
broken
powerless
did
they
yield
now
when
the
issue
was
the
maintenance
of
their
own
republicanism
and
their
own
legislative
rights
against
the
executive
power
and
the
royalists
i
need
not
here
narrate
the
shameful
history
of
their
dissolution
it
was
not
a
downfall
it
was
extinction
their
history
is
at
an
end
for
all
time
in
the
period
that
follows
they
figure
whether
within
or
without
the
assembly
only
as
memories
memories
that
seem
again
to
come
to
life
so
soon
as
the
question
is
again
only
the
word
republic
and
as
often
as
the
revolutionary
conflict
threatens
to
sink
down
to
the
lowest
level
in
passing
i
might
observe
that
the
journal
which
gave
to
this
party
its
name
the
national
goes
over
to
socialism
during
the
following
period
before
we
close
this
period
we
must
look
back
upon
the
two
powers
one
of
destroys
the
other
on
december
while
from
december
down
to
the
departure
of
the
constitutional
assembly
they
live
marital
relations
we
mean
louis
bonaparte
on
hand
on
the
other
the
party
of
the
allied
royalists
of
order
and
of
the
large
bourgeoisie
at
the
inauguration
of
his
presidency
bonaparte
forthwith
framed
a
ministry
out
of
the
party
of
order
at
whose
head
he
placed
odillon
barrot
be
it
noted
the
old
leader
of
the
liberal
wing
of
the
parliamentary
bourgeoisie
barrot
had
finally
hunted
down
a
seat
in
the
ministry
the
spook
of
which
had
been
pursuing
him
since
and
what
is
more
he
had
the
chairmanship
in
this
ministry
although
not
as
he
had
imagined
under
louis
philippe
the
promoted
leader
of
the
parliamentary
opposition
but
with
the
commission
to
kill
a
parliament
and
moreover
as
an
ally
of
all
his
arch
enemies
the
jesuits
and
the
legitimists
finally
he
leads
the
bride
home
but
only
after
she
has
been
prostituted
as
to
bonaparte
he
seemed
to
eclipse
himself
completely
the
party
of
order
acted
for
him
immediately
at
the
first
session
of
the
ministry
the
expedition
to
rome
was
decided
upon
which
it
was
there
agreed
was
to
be
carried
out
behind
i
the
back
of
the
national
assembly
and
the
funds
for
which
it
was
equally
agreed
were
to
be
wrung
from
the
assembly
under
false
pretences
thus
the
start
was
made
with
a
swindle
on
the
national
assembly
together
with
a
secret
conspiracy
with
the
absolute
foreign
powers
against
the
revolutionary
roman
republic
in
the
same
way
and
with
a
similar
maneuver
did
bonaparte
prepare
his
stroke
of
december
against
the
royalist
legislature
and
its
constitutional
republic
let
it
not
be
forgotten
that
the
same
party
which
on
december
constituted
bonaparte
ministry
constituted
also
on
december
the
majority
of
the
legislative
national
assembly
in
august
the
constitutive
assembly
decided
not
to
dissolve
until
it
had
prepared
and
promulgated
a
whole
series
of
organic
laws
intended
to
supplement
the
constitution
the
party
of
order
proposed
to
the
assembly
through
representative
rateau
on
january
to
let
the
organic
laws
go
and
rather
to
order
its
own
dissolution
not
the
ministry
alone
with
odillon
barrot
at
its
head
but
all
the
royalist
members
of
the
national
assembly
were
also
at
this
time
hectoring
to
it
that
its
dissolution
was
necessary
for
the
restoration
of
the
public
credit
for
the
consolidation
of
order
to
put
an
end
to
the
existing
uncertain
and
provisional
and
establish
a
definite
state
of
things
they
claimed
that
its
continued
existence
hindered
the
effectiveness
of
the
new
government
that
it
sought
to
prolong
its
life
out
of
pure
malice
and
that
the
country
was
tired
of
it
bonaparte
took
notice
of
all
these
invectives
hurled
at
the
legislative
power
he
learned
them
by
heart
and
on
december
he
showed
the
parliamentary
royalists
that
he
had
learned
from
them
he
repeated
their
own
slogans
against
themselves
the
barrot
ministry
and
the
party
of
order
went
further
they
called
all
over
france
for
petitions
to
the
national
assembly
in
which
that
body
was
politely
requested
to
disappear
thus
they
led
the
unorganic
masses
to
the
fray
against
the
national
assembly
the
constitutionally
organized
expression
of
people
itself
they
taught
bonaparte
to
appeal
from
the
parliamentary
body
to
the
people
finally
on
january
the
day
arrived
when
the
constitutional
assembly
was
to
decide
about
its
own
dissolution
on
that
day
the
body
found
its
building
occupied
by
the
military
changarnier
the
general
of
the
party
of
order
in
whose
hands
was
joined
the
supreme
command
of
both
the
national
guards
and
the
regulars
held
that
day
a
great
military
review
as
though
a
battle
were
imminent
and
the
coalized
royalists
declared
threateningly
to
the
constitutional
assembly
that
force
would
be
applied
if
it
did
not
act
willingly
it
was
willing
and
chaffered
only
for
a
very
short
respite
what
else
was
the
of
january
than
the
coup
of
december
only
executed
by
the
royalists
with
napoleon
aid
against
the
republican
national
assembly
these
gentlemen
did
not
notice
or
did
not
want
to
notice
that
napoleon
utilized
the
of
january
to
cause
a
part
of
the
troops
to
file
before
him
in
front
of
the
tuileries
and
that
he
seized
with
avidity
this
very
first
open
exercise
of
the
military
against
the
parliamentary
power
in
order
to
hint
at
caligula
the
allied
royalists
saw
only
their
own
changarnier
another
reason
that
particularly
moved
the
party
of
order
forcibly
to
shorten
the
term
of
the
constitutional
assembly
were
the
organic
laws
the
laws
that
were
to
supplement
the
constitution
as
for
instance
the
laws
on
education
on
religion
etc
the
allied
royalists
had
every
interest
in
framing
these
laws
themselves
and
not
allowing
them
to
be
framed
by
the
already
suspicious
republicans
among
these
organic
laws
there
was
however
one
on
the
responsibility
of
the
president
of
the
republic
in
the
legislature
was
just
engaged
in
framing
such
a
law
when
bonaparte
forestalled
that
political
stroke
by
his
own
of
december
what
all
would
not
the
coalized
royalists
have
given
in
their
winter
parliamentary
campaign
of
had
they
but
found
this
responsibility
law
ready
made
and
framed
at
that
by
the
suspicious
the
vicious
republican
assembly
after
on
january
the
constitutive
assembly
had
itself
broken
its
last
weapon
the
barrot
ministry
and
the
friends
of
order
harassed
it
to
death
left
nothing
undone
to
humiliate
it
and
wrung
from
its
weakness
despairing
of
itself
laws
that
cost
it
the
last
vestige
of
respect
with
the
public
bonaparte
occupied
with
his
own
fixed
napoleonic
idea
was
audacious
enough
openly
to
exploit
this
degradation
of
the
parliamentary
power
when
the
national
assembly
on
may
passed
a
vote
of
censure
upon
the
ministry
on
account
of
the
occupation
of
by
oudinot
and
ordered
that
the
roman
expedition
be
brought
back
to
its
alleged
purpose
bonaparte
published
that
same
evening
in
the
moniteur
a
letter
to
oudinot
in
which
he
congratulated
him
on
his
heroic
feats
and
already
in
contrast
with
the
parliamentarians
posed
as
the
generous
protector
of
the
army
the
royalists
smiled
at
this
they
took
him
simply
for
their
dupe
finally
as
marrast
the
president
of
the
constitutional
assembly
believed
on
a
certain
occasion
the
safety
of
the
body
to
be
in
danger
and
resting
on
the
constitution
made
a
requisition
upon
a
colonel
together
with
his
regiment
the
colonel
refused
obedience
took
refuge
behind
the
discipline
and
referred
marrast
to
changarnier
who
scornfully
sent
him
off
with
the
remark
that
he
did
not
like
bayonettes
intelligentes
intelligent
bayonets
in
november
as
the
coalized
royalists
wanted
to
begin
the
decisive
struggle
with
bonaparte
they
sought
by
means
of
their
notorious
questors
bill
to
enforce
the
principle
of
the
right
of
the
president
of
the
national
assembly
to
issue
direct
requisitions
for
troops
one
of
their
generals
leflo
supported
the
motion
in
vain
did
changarnier
vote
for
it
or
did
thiers
render
homage
to
the
cautious
wisdom
of
the
late
constitutional
assembly
the
minister
of
war
arnaud
answered
him
as
changarnier
had
answered
marrast
and
he
did
so
amidst
the
plaudits
of
the
mountain
thus
did
the
party
of
order
itself
when
as
yet
it
was
not
the
national
assembly
when
as
yet
it
was
only
a
ministry
brand
the
parliamentary
regime
and
yet
this
party
objects
vociferously
when
the
of
december
banishes
that
regime
from
france
we
wish
it
a
happy
journey
iii
on
may
the
legislative
national
assembly
convened
on
december
it
was
broken
up
this
period
embraces
the
term
of
the
constitutional
or
parliamentary
public
in
the
first
french
revolution
upon
the
reign
of
the
constitutionalists
succeeds
that
of
the
girondins
and
upon
the
reign
of
the
girondins
follows
that
of
the
jacobins
each
of
these
parties
in
succession
rests
upon
its
more
advanced
element
so
soon
as
it
has
carried
the
revolution
far
enough
not
to
be
able
to
keep
pace
with
much
less
march
ahead
of
it
it
is
shoved
aside
by
its
more
daring
allies
who
stand
behind
it
and
it
is
sent
to
the
guillotine
thus
the
revolution
moves
along
an
upward
line
just
the
reverse
in
the
proletarian
party
appears
as
an
appendage
to
the
small
traders
or
democratic
party
it
is
betrayed
by
the
latter
and
allowed
to
fall
on
april
may
and
in
the
june
days
in
its
turn
the
democratic
party
leans
upon
the
shoulders
of
the
bourgeois
republicans
barely
do
the
bourgeois
republicans
believe
themselves
firmly
in
power
than
they
shake
off
these
troublesome
associates
for
the
purpose
of
themselves
leaning
upon
the
shoulders
of
the
party
of
order
the
party
of
order
draws
in
its
shoulders
lets
the
bourgeois
republicans
tumble
down
heels
over
head
and
throws
itself
upon
the
shoulders
of
the
armed
power
finally
still
of
the
mind
that
it
is
sustained
by
the
shoulders
of
the
armed
power
the
party
of
order
notices
one
fine
morning
that
these
shoulders
have
turned
into
bayonets
each
party
kicks
backward
at
those
that
are
pushing
forward
and
leans
forward
upon
those
that
are
crowding
backward
no
wonder
that
in
this
ludicrous
posture
each
loses
its
balance
and
after
having
cut
the
unavoidable
grimaces
breaks
down
amid
singular
somersaults
accordingly
the
revolution
moves
along
a
downward
line
it
finds
itself
in
this
retreating
motion
before
the
last
is
cleared
away
and
the
first
governmental
authority
of
the
revolution
has
been
constituted
the
period
we
now
have
before
us
embraces
the
motliest
jumble
of
crying
contradictions
constitutionalists
who
openly
conspire
against
the
constitution
revolutionists
who
admittedly
are
constitutional
a
national
assembly
that
wishes
to
be
omnipotent
yet
remains
parliamentary
a
mountain
that
finds
its
occupation
in
submission
that
parries
its
present
defeats
with
prophecies
of
future
victories
royalists
who
constitute
the
patres
conscripti
of
the
republic
and
are
compelled
by
the
situation
to
uphold
abroad
the
hostile
monarchic
houses
whose
adherents
they
are
while
in
france
they
support
the
republic
that
they
hate
an
executive
power
that
finds
its
strength
in
its
very
weakness
and
its
dignity
in
the
contempt
that
it
inspires
a
republic
that
is
nothing
else
than
the
combined
infamy
of
two
monarchies
the
restoration
and
the
july
monarchy
with
an
imperial
label
unions
whose
first
clause
is
disunion

that
seem
to
intensify
themselves
periodically
only
in

without

pretentious
efforts
made
for

and
bourgeois
frights
at
the
danger
of
the
destruction
of
the
world
simultaneous
with
the
carrying
on
of
the
pettiest
intrigues
and
the
performance
of
court
comedies
by
the

saviours
who
in
their

recall
the

not
so

as
the

the

by
the
artful
stupidity
of
a

individual
the

often
as
it
speaks
through
the
general
suffrage
seeking
its
true
expression
in
the
prescriptive
enemies
of
the
public
interests
until
it
finally
finds
it
in
the
arbitrary

of
a
filibuster

with

violence
when
the

constantly
conjured
up
and
exorcised
by
the
finally
does
appear
it
does
not
appear
with
the
anarchist
phrygian
cap
on
its
head
but
in
the
uniform
of
order
in
the
red
breeches
of
the
french
soldier
we
saw
that
the
ministry
which
bonaparte
installed
on
december
the
day
of
his
ascension
was
a
ministry
of
the
party
of
order
of
the
legitimist
and
orleanist
coalition
the
ministry
had
weathered
the
republican
constitutive
convention
whose
term
of
life
it
had
shortened
with
more
or
less
violence
and
found
itself
still
at
the
helm
changamier
the
general
of
the
allied
royalists
continued
to
unite
in
his
person
the
of
the
first
military
division
and
of
the
parisian
national
guard
finally
the
general
elections
had
secured
the
large
majority
in
the
national
assembly
to
the
party
of
order
here
the
deputies
and
peers
of
louis
phillipe
met
a
saintly
crowd
of
legitimists
for
whose
benefit
numerous
ballots
of
the
nation
had
been
converted
into
admission
tickets
to
the
political
stage
the
bonapartist
representatives
were
too
thinly
sowed
to
be
able
to
build
an
independent
parliamentary
party
they
appeared
only
as
mauvaise
queue
practical
joke
played
upon
the
party
of
order
thus
the
party
of
order
was
in
possession
of
the
government
of
the
army
and
of
the
legislative
body
in
short
of
the
total
power
of
the
state
morally
strengthened
by
the
general
elections
that
caused
their
sovereignty
to
appear
as
the
will
of
the
people
and
by
the
simultaneous
victory
of
the
on
the
whole
continent
of
europe
never
did
party
open
its
campaign
with
larger
means
at
its
disposal
and
under
more
favorable
auspices
the
shipwrecked
pure
republicans
found
themselves
in
the
legislative
national
assembly
melted
down
to
a
clique
of
fifty
men
with
the
african
generals
cavaignac
lamorciere
and
bedeau
at
its
head
the
great
opposition
party
was
however
formed
by
the
mountain
this
parliamentary
baptismal
name
was
given
to
itself
by
the
social
democratic
party
it
disposed
of
more
than
two
hundred
votes
out
of
the
seven
hundred
and
fifty
in
the
national
assembly
and
hence
was
at
least
just
as
powerful
as
any
one
of
the
three
factions
of
the
party
of
order
its
relative
minority
to
the
total
royalist
coalition
seemed
counterbalanced
by
special
circumstances
not
only
did
the
departmental
election
returns
show
that
it
had
gained
a
considerable
following
among
the
rural
population
but
furthermore
it
numbered
almost
all
the
paris
deputies
in
its
camp
the
army
had
by
the
election
of
three
made
a
confession
of
democratic
faith
and
the
leader
of
the
mountain
had
in
contrast
to
all
the
representatives
of
the
party
of
order
been
raised
to
the
rank
of
the
parliamentary
nobility
by
five
departments
who
combined
their
suffrages
upon
him
accordingly
in
view
of
the
inevitable
collisions
of
the
royalists
among
themselves
on
the
one
hand
and
of
the
whole
party
of
order
with
bonaparte
on
the
other
the
mountain
seemed
on
may
to
have
before
it
all
the
elements
of
success
a
fortnight
later
it
had
lost
everything
its
honor
included
before
we
follow
this
parliamentary
history
any
further
a
few
observations
are
necessary
in
order
to
avoid
certain
common
deceptions
concerning
the
whole
character
of
the
epoch
that
lies
before
us
according
to
the
view
of
the
democrats
the
issue
during
the
period
of
the
legislative
national
assembly
was
the
same
as
during
the
period
of
the
constitutive
assembly
simply
the
struggle
between
republicans
and
royalists
the
movement
itself
was
summed
up
by
them
in
the
reaction
night
in
which
all
cats
are
grey
and
allows
them
to
drawl
out
their
drowsy
commonplaces
indeed
at
first
sight
the
party
of
order
presents
the
appearance
of
a
tangle
of
royalist
factions
that
not
only
intrigue
against
each
other
each
aiming
to
raise
its
own
pretender
to
the
throne
and
exclude
the
pretender
of
the
opposite
party
but
also
are
all
united
in
a
common
hatred
for
and
common
attacks
against
the
republic
on
its
side
the
mountain
appears
in
to
the
royalist
conspiracy
as
the
representative
of
the
republic
the
party
of
order
seems
constantly
engaged
in
a
reaction
which
neither
more
nor
less
than
in
prussia
is
directed
against
the
press
the
right
of
association
and
the
like
and
is
enforced
by
brutal
police
interventions
on
the
part
of
the
bureaucracy
the
police
and
the
public
prosecutor
just
as
in
prussia
the
mountain
on
the
contrary
is
engaged
with
equal
assiduity
in
parrying
these
attacks
and
thus
in
defending
the
eternal
rights
of
man
as
every
people
party
has
more
or
less
done
for
the
last
hundred
and
fifty
years
at
a
closer
inspection
however
of
the
situation
and
of
the
parties
this
superficial
appearance
which
veils
the
class
struggle
together
with
the
peculiar
physiognomy
of
this
period
vanishes
wholly
legitimists
and
orleanists
constituted
as
said
before
the
two
large
factions
of
the
party
of
order
what
held
these
two
factions
to
their
respective
pretenders
and
inversely
kept
them
apart
from
each
other
what
else
was
it
but
the
lily
and
the
tricolor
the
house
of

different
shades
of
royalty
under
the
bourbons
large
landed
property
ruled
together
with
its
parsons
and
lackeys
under
the
orleanist
it
was
the
high

large

large
commerce
capital
with
its
retinue
of
lawyers
professors
and
orators
the
legitimate

was
but
the
political
expression
for
the
hereditary
rule
of
the
landlords
as
the
july
monarchy
was
bur
the
political
expression
for
the
usurped
rule
of
the
bourgeois
upstarts
what
accordingly
kept
these
two
factions
apart
was
no
set
of
principles
it
was
their
material
conditions
for
life
two
different
sorts
of
property
it
was
the
old
antagonism
of
the
city
and
the
country
the
rivalry
between
capital
and
landed
property
that
simultaneously
old
recollections
personal
animosities
fears
and
hopes
prejudices
and
illusions
sympathies
and
antipathies
convictions
faith
and
principles
bound
these
factions
to
one
house
or
the
other
who
denies
it
upon
the
several
forms
of
property
upon
the
social
conditions
of
existence
a
whole
superstructure
is
reared
of
various
and
peculiarly
shaped
feelings
illusions
habits
of
thought
and
conceptions
of
life
the
whole
class
produces
and
shapes
these
out
of
its
material
foundation
and
out
of
the
corresponding
social
conditions
the
individual
unit
to
whom
they
flow
through
tradition
and
education
may
fancy
that
they
constitute
the
true
reasons
for
and
premises
of
his
conduct
although
orleanists
and
legitimists
each
of
these
factions
sought
to
make
itself
and
the
other
believe
that
what
kept
the
two
apart
was
the
attachment
of
each
to
its
respective
royal
house
nevertheless
facts
proved
later
that
it
rather
was
their
divided
interest
that
forbade
the
union
of
the
two
royal
houses
as
in
private
life
the
distinction
is
made
between
what
a
man
thinks
of
himself
and
says
and
that
which
he
really
is
and
does
so
all
the
more
must
the
phrases
and
notions
of
parties
in
historic
struggles
be
distinguished
from
the
real
organism
and
their
real
interests
their
notions
and
their
reality
orleanists
and
legitimists
found
themselves
in
the
republic
beside
each
other
with
equal
claims
each
side
wishing
in
opposition
to
the
other
to
carry
out
the
restoration
of
its
own
royal
house
meant
nothing
else
than
that
each
of
the
two
great
interests
into
which
the
bourgeoisie
is
divided
land
and
capital
sought
to
restore
its
own
supremacy
and
the
subordinacy
of
the
other
we
speak
of
two
bourgeois
interests
because
large
landed
property
despite
its
feudal
coquetry
and
pride
of
race
has
become
completely
bourgeois
through
the
development
of
modern
society
thus
did
the
tories
of
england
long
fancy
that
they
were
enthusiastic
for
the
kingdom
the
church
and
the
beauties
of
the
old
english
constitution
until
the
day
of
danger
wrung
from
them
the
admission
that
their
enthusiasm
was
only
for
ground
rent
the
coalized
royalists
carried
on
their
intrigues
against
each
other
in
the
press
in
ems
in
clarmont
outside
of
the
parliament
behind
the
scenes
they
don
again
their
old
orleanist
and
legitimist
liveries
and
conduct
their
old
tourneys
on
the
public
stage
however
in
their
public
acts
as
a
great
parliamentary
party
they
dispose
of
their
respective
royal
houses
with
mere
courtesies
adjourn
in
infinitum
the
restoration
of
the
monarchy
their
real
business
is
transacted
as
party
of
order
under
a
social
not
a
political
title
as
representatives
of
the
bourgeois
social
system
not
as
knights
of
traveling
princesses
but
as
the
bourgeois
class
against
the
other
classes
not
as
royalists
against
republicans
indeed
as
party
of
order
they
exercised
a
more
unlimited
and
harder
dominion
over
the
other
classes
of
society
than
ever
before
either
under
the
restoration
or
the
july
thing
possible
only
under
the
form
of
a
parliamentary
republic
because
under
this
form
alone
could
the
two
large
divisions
of
the
french
bourgeoisie
be
united
in
other
words
only
under
this
form
could
they
place
on
the
order
of
business
the
sovereignty
of
their
class
in
lieu
of
the
regime
of
a
privileged
faction
of
the
same
if
this
notwithstanding
they
are
seen
as
the
party
of
order
to
insult
the
republic
and
express
their
antipathy
for
it
it
happened
not
out
of
royalist
traditions
only
instinct
taught
them
that
while
indeed
the
republic
completes
their
authority
it
at
the
same
time
undermined
their
social
foundation
in
that
without
intermediary
without
the
mask
of
the
crown
without
being
able
to
turn
aside
the
national
interest
by
means
of
its
subordinate
struggles
among
its
own
conflicting
elements
and
with
the
crown
the
republic
is
compelled
to
stand
up
sharp
against
the
subjugated
classes
and
wrestle
with
them
it
was
a
sense
of
weakness
that
caused
them
to
recoil
before
the
unqualified
demands
of
their
own
class
rule
and
to
retreat
to
the
less
complete
less
developed
and
for
that
very
reason
less
dangerous
forms
of
the
same
as
often
on
the
contrary
as
the
allied
royalists
come
into
conflict
with
the
pretender
who
stands
before
them
with
bonaparte
as
often
as
they
believe
their
parliamentary
omnipotence
to
be
endangered
by
the
executive
in
other
words
as
often
as
they
must
trot
out
the
political
title
of
their
authority
they
step
up
as
republicans
not
as
royalists
and
this
is
done
from
the
orleanist
thiers
who
warns
the
national
assembly
that
the
republic
divides
them
least
down
to
legitimist
berryer
who
on
december
the
scarf
of
the
tricolor
around
him
harangues
the
people
assembled
before
the
mayor
building
of
the
tenth
arrondissement
as
a
tribune
in
the
name
of
the
republic
the
echo
however
derisively
answering
back
to
him
henry
henry
v
the
candidate
of
the
bourbons
or
legitimists
for
the
throne
however
against
the
allied
bourgeois
a
coalition
was
made
between
the
small
traders
and
the
workingmen
the
social
democratic
party
the
small
traders
found
themselves
ill
rewarded
after
the
june
days
of
they
saw
their
material
interests
endangered
and
the
democratic
guarantees
that
were
to
uphold
their
interests
made
doubtful
hence
they
drew
closer
to
the
workingmen
on
the
other
hand
their
parliamentary
representatives
the
mountain
after
being
shoved
aside
during
the
dictatorship
of
the
bourgeois
republicans
had
during
the
last
half
of
the
term
of
the
constitutive
convention
regained
their
lost
popularity
through
the
struggle
with
bonaparte
and
the
royalist
ministers
they
had
made
an
alliance
with
the
socialist
leaders
during
february
reconciliation
banquets
were
held
a
common
program
was
drafted
joint
election
committees
were
empanelled
and
fusion
candidates
were
set
up
the
revolutionary
point
was
thereby
broken
off
from
the
social
demands
of
the
proletariat
and
a
democratic
turn
given
to
them
while
from
the
democratic
claims
of
the
small
traders
class
the
mere
political
form
was
rubbed
off
and
the
socialist
point
was
pushed
forward
thus
came
the
social
democracy
about
the
new
mountain
the
result
of
this
combination
contained
with
the
exception
of
some
figures
from
the
working
class
and
some
socialist
sectarians
the
identical
elements
of
the
old
mountain
only
numerically
stronger
in
the
course
of
events
it
had
however
changed
together
with
the
class
that
it
represented
the
peculiar
character
of
the
social
democracy
is
summed
up
in
this
that
institutions
are
demanded
as
the
means
not
to
remove
the
two
extremes
capital
and
but
in
order
to
weaken
their
antagonism
and
transform
them
into
a
harmonious
whole
however
different
the
methods
may
be
that
are
proposed
for
the
accomplishment
of
this
object
however
much
the
object
itself
may
be
festooned
with
more
or
less
revolutionary
fancies
the
substance
remains
the
same
this
substance
is
the
transformation
of
society
upon
democratic
lines
but
a
transformation
within
the
boundaries
of
the
small
traders
class
no
one
must
run
away
with
the
narrow
notion
that
the
small
traders
class
means
on
principle
to
enforce
a
selfish
class
interest
it
believes
rather
that
the
special
conditions
for
its
own
emancipation
are
the
general
conditions
under
which
alone
modern
society
can
be
saved
and
the
class
struggle
avoided
likewise
must
we
avoid
running
away
with
the
notion
that
the
democratic
representatives
are
all
shopkeepers
or
enthuse
for
these
they
may
by
education
and
individual
standing
be
as
distant
from
them
as
heaven
is
from
earth
that
which
makes
them
representatives
of
the
small
traders
class
is
that
they
do
not
intellectually
leap
the
bounds
which
that
class
itself
does
not
leap
in
practical
life
that
consequently
they
are
theoretically
driven
to
the
same
problems
and
solutions
to
which
material
interests
and
social
standing
practically
drive
the
latter
such
in
fact
is
at
all
times
the
relation
of
the
political
and
the
literary
representatives
of
a
class
to
the
class
they
represent
after
the
foregoing
explanations
it
goes
saying
that
while
the
mountain
is
constantly
wrestling
for
the
republic
and
the
rights
of
man
neither
the
republic
nor
the
rights
of
man
is
its
real
goal
as
little
as
an
army
whose
weapons
it
is
sought
to
deprive
it
of
and
that
defends
itself
steps
on
the
field
of
battle
simply
in
order
to
remain
in
possession
of
implements
of
warfare
the
party
of
order
provoked
the
mountain
immediately
upon
the
convening
of
the
assembly
the
bourgeoisie
now
felt
the
necessity
of
disposing
of
the
democratic
small
traders
class
just
as
a
year
before
it
had
understood
the
necessity
of
putting
an
end
to
the
revolutionary
proletariat
but
the
position
of
the
foe
had
changed
the
strength
of
the
proletarian
party
was
on
the
streets
that
of
the
small
traders
class
was
in
the
national
assembly
itself
the
point
was
accordingly
to
wheedle
them
out
of
the
national
assembly
into
the
street
and
to
have
them
break
their
parliamentary
power
themselves
before
time
and
opportunity
could
consolidate
them
the
mountain
jumped
with
loose
reins
into
the
trap
the
bombardment
of
rome
by
the
french
troops
was
the
bait
thrown
at
the
mountain
it
violated
article
of
the
constitution
which
forbade
the
french
republic
to
use
its
forces
against
the
liberties
of
other
nations
besides
article
iv
forbade
all
declaration
of
war
by
the
executive
without
the
consent
of
the
national
assembly
furthermore
the
constitutive
assembly
had
censured
the
roman
expedition
by
its
resolution
of
may
upon
these
grounds
submitted
on
june
a
motion
impeaching
bonaparte
and
his
ministers
instigated
by
the
of
thiers
he
even
allowed
himself
to
be
carried
away
to
the
point
of
threatening
to
defend
the
constitution
by
all
means
even
arms
in
hand
the
mountain
rose
as
one
man
and
repeated
the
challenge
on
june
the
national
assembly
rejected
the
notion
to
impeach
and
the
mountain
left
the
parliament
the
events
of
june
are
known
the
proclamation
by
a
part
of
the
mountain
pronouncing
napoleon
and
his
ministers
outside
the
pale
of
the
constitution
the
street
parades
of
the
democratic
national
guards
who
unarmed
as
they
were
flew
apart
at
contact
with
the
troops
of
changarnier
etc
part
of
the
mountain
fled
abroad
another
part
was
assigned
to
the
high
court
of
bourges
and
a
parliamentary
regulation
placed
the
rest
under
the
supervision
of
the
president
of
the
national
assembly
paris
was
again
put
under
a
state
of
siege
and
the
democratic
portion
of
the
national
guards
was
disbanded
thus
the
influence
of
the
mountain
in
parliament
was
broken
together
with
the
power
of
the
small
traders
class
in
paris
lyons
where
the
of
june
had
given
the
signal
to
a
bloody
labor
uprising
was
together
with
the
five
surrounding
departments
likewise
pronounced
in
state
of
siege
a
condition
that
continues
down
to
this
moment
january
the
bulk
of
the
mountain
had
left
its
vanguard
in
the
lurch
by
refusing
their
signatures
to
the
proclamation
the
press
had
deserted
only
two
papers
dared
to
publish
the
pronunciamento
the
small
traders
had
betrayed
their
representatives
the
national
guards
stayed
away
or
where
they
did
turn
up
hindered
the
raising
of
barricades
the
representatives
had
duped
the
small
traders
nowhere
were
the
alleged
affiliated
members
from
the
army
to
be
seen
finally
instead
of
gathering
strength
from
them
the
democratic
party
had
infected
the
proletariat
with
its
own
weakness
and
as
usual
with
democratic
feats
the
leaders
had
the
satisfaction
of
charging
their
people
with
desertion
and
the
people
had
the
satisfaction
of
charging
their
leaders
with
fraud
seldom
was
an
act
announced
with
greater
noise
than
the
campaign
contemplated
by
the
mountain
seldom
was
an
event
trumpeted
ahead
with
more
certainty
and
longer
beforehand
than
the
inevitable
victory
of
the
democracy
this
is
evident
the
democrats
believe
in
the
trombones
before
whose
blasts
the
walls
of
jericho
fall
together
as
often
as
they
stand
before
the
walls
of
despotism
they
seek
to
imitate
the
miracle
if
the
mountain
wished
to
win
in
parliament
it
should
not
appeal
to
arms
if
it
called
to
arms
in
parliament
it
should
not
conduct
itself
parliamentarily
on
the
street
if
the
friendly
demonstration
was
meant
seriously
it
was
silly
not
to
foresee
that
it
would
meet
with
a
warlike
reception
if
it
was
intended
for
actual
war
it
was
rather
original
to
lay
aside
the
weapons
with
which
war
had
to
be
conducted
but
the
revolutionary
threats
of
the
middle
class
and
of
their
democratic
representatives
are
mere
attempts
to
frighten
an
adversary
when
they
have
run
themselves
into
a
blind
alley
when
they
have
sufficiently
compromised
themselves
and
are
compelled
to
execute
their
threats
the
thing
is
done
in
a
hesitating
manner
that
avoids
nothing
so
much
as
the
means
to
the
end
and
catches
at
pretexts
to
succumb
the
bray
of
the
overture
that
announces
the
fray
is
lost
in
a
timid
growl
so
soon
as
this
is
to
start
the
actors
cease
to
take
themselves
seriously
and
the
performance
falls
flat
like
an
inflated
balloon
that
is
pricked
with
a
needle
no
party
exaggerates
to
itself
the
means
at
its
disposal
more
than
the
democratic
none
deceives
itself
with
greater
heedlessness
on
the
situation
a
part
of
the
army
voted
for
it
thereupon
the
mountain
is
of
the
opinion
that
the
army
would
revolt
in
its
favor
and
by
what
occasion
by
an
occasion
that
from
the
standpoint
of
the
troops
meant
nothing
else
than
that
the
revolutionary
soldiers
should
take
the
part
of
the
soldiers
of
rome
against
french
soldiers
on
the
other
hand
the
memory
of
june
was
still
too
fresh
not
to
keep
alive
a
deep
aversion
on
the
part
of
the
proletariat
towards
the
national
guard
and
a
strong
feeling
of
mistrust
on
the
part
of
the
leaders
of
the
secret
societies
for
the
democratic
leaders
in
order
to
balance
these
differences
great
common
interests
at
stake
were
needed
the
violation
of
an
abstract
constitutional
paragraph
could
not
supply
such
interests
had
not
the
constitution
been
repeatedly
violated
according
to
the
assurances
of
the
democrats
themselves
had
not
the
most
popular
papers
branded
them
as
a
artifice
but
the
democrat
by
reason
of
his
representing
the
middle
class
that
is
to
say
a
transition
class
in
which
the
interests
of
two
other
classes
are
mutually
dulled
imagines
himself
above
all
class
contrast
the
democrats
grant
that
opposed
to
them
stands
a
privileged
class
but
they
together
with
the
whole
remaining
mass
of
the
nation
constitute
the
people
what
they
represent
is
the
people
rights
their
interests
are
the
people
interests
hence
they
do
not
consider
that
at
an
impending
struggle
they
need
to
examine
the
interests
and
attitude
of
the
different
classes
they
need
not
too
seriously
weigh
their
own
means
all
they
have
to
do
is
to
give
the
signal
in
order
to
have
the
people
fall
upon
the
oppressors
with
all
its
inexhaustible
resources
if
thereupon
in
the
execution
their
interests
turn
out
to
be
uninteresting
and
their
power
to
be
impotence
it
is
ascribed
either
to
depraved
sophists
who
split
up
the
undivisible
people
into
several
hostile
camps
or
to
the
army
being
too
far
brutalized
and
blinded
to
appreciate
the
pure
aims
of
the
democracy
as
its
own
best
or
to
some
detail
in
the
execution
that
wrecks
the
whole
plan
or
finally
to
an
unforeseen
accident
that
spoiled
the
game
this
time
at
all
events
the
democrat
comes
out
of
the
disgraceful
defeat
as
immaculate
as
he
went
innocently
into
it
and
with
the
refreshed
conviction
that
he
must
win
not
that
he
himself
and
his
party
must
give
up
their
old
standpoint
but
that
on
the
contrary
conditions
must
come
to
his
aid
for
all
this
one
must
not
picture
to
himself
the
decimated
broken
and
by
the
new
parliamentary
regulation
humbled
mountain
altogether
too
unhappy
if
june
removed
its
leaders
it
on
the
other
hand
made
room
for
new
ones
of
inferior
capacity
who
are
flattered
by
their
new
position
if
their
impotence
in
parliament
could
no
longer
be
doubted
they
were
now
justified
to
limit
their
activity
to
outbursts
of
moral
indignation
if
the
party
of
order
pretended
to
see
in
them
as
the
last
official
representatives
of
the
revolution
all
the
horrors
of
anarchy
incarnated
they
were
free
to
appear
all
the
more
flat
and
modest
in
reality
over
june
they
consoled
themselves
with
the
profound
expression
if
they
but
dare
to
assail
universal
suffrage
then
then
we
will
show
who
we
are
nous
verrons
we
shall
see
as
to
the
mountaineers
who
had
fled
abroad
it
suffices
here
to
say
that
he
having
accomplished
the
feat
of
hopelessly
ruining
in
barely
a
fortnight
the
powerful
party
at
whose
head
he
stood
found
himself
called
upon
to
build
up
a
french
government
in
partibus
that
his
figure
at
a
distance
removed
from
the
field
of
action
seemed
to
gain
in
size
in
the
measure
that
the
level
of
the
revolution
sank
and
the
official
prominences
of
official
france
became
more
and
more
dwarfish
that
he
could
figure
as
republican
pretender
for
and
periodically
issued
to
the
wallachians
and
other
peoples
circulars
in
which
despot
of
the
continent
is
threatened
with
the
feats
that
he
and
his
allies
had
in
contemplation
was
proudhon
wholly
wrong
when
he
cried
out
to
these
gentlemen
vous
que
des
blaqueurs
you
are
nothing
but
fakirs
the
party
of
order
had
on
june
not
only
broken
up
the
mountain
it
had
also
established
the
subordination
of
the
constitution
to
the
majority
decisions
of
the
national
assembly
so
indeed
did
the
republic
understand
it
to
wit
that
the
bourgeois
ruled
here
in
parliamentary
form
without
as
in
the
monarchy
finding
a
check
in
the
veto
of
the
executive
power
or
the
liability
of
parliament
to
dissolution
it
was
a
parliamentary
republic
as
thiers
styled
it
but
if
on
june
the
bourgeoisie
secured
its
omnipotence
within
the
parliament
building
did
it
not
also
strike
the
parliament
itself
as
against
the
executive
and
the
people
with
incurable
weakness
by
excluding
its
most
popular
part
by
giving
up
numerous
deputies
without
further
ceremony
to
the
mercies
of
the
public
prosecutor
it
abolished
its
own
parliamentary
inviolability
the
humiliating
regulation
that
it
subjected
the
mountain
to
raised
the
president
of
the
republic
in
the
same
measure
that
it
lowered
the
individual
representatives
of
the
people
by
branding
an
insurrection
in
defense
of
the
constitution
as
anarchy
and
as
a
deed
looking
to
the
overthrow
of
society
it
interdicted
to
itself
all
appeal
to
insurrection
whenever
the
executive
should
violate
the
constitution
against
it
and
indeed
the
irony
of
history
wills
it
that
the
very
general
who
by
order
of
bonaparte
bombarded
rome
and
thus
gave
the
immediate
occasion
to
the
constitutional
riot
of
june
that
oudinot
on
december
is
the
one
imploringly
and
vainly
to
be
offered
to
the
people
by
the
party
of
order
as
the
general
of
the
constitution
another
hero
of
june
vieyra
who
earned
praise
from
the
tribune
of
the
national
assembly
for
the
brutalities
that
he
had
committed
in
the
democratic
newspaper
offices
at
the
head
of
a
gang
of
national
guards
in
the
hire
of
the
high
finance
this
identical
vieyra
was
initiated
in
the
conspiracy
of
bonaparte
and
contributed
materially
in
cutting
off
all
protection
that
could
come
to
the
national
assembly
in
the
hour
of
its
agony
from
the
side
of
the
national
guard
june
had
still
another
meaning
the
mountain
had
wanted
to
place
bonaparte
under
charges
their
defeat
was
accordingly
a
direct
victory
of
bonaparte
it
was
his
personal
triumph
over
his
democratic
enemies
the
party
of
order
fought
for
the
victory
bonaparte
needed
only
to
pocket
it
he
did
so
on
june
a
proclamation
was
to
be
read
on
the
walls
of
paris
wherein
the
president
as
it
were
without
his
connivance
against
his
will
driven
by
the
mere
force
of
circumstances
steps
forward
from
his
cloisterly
seclusion
like
misjudged
virtue
complains
of
the
calumnies
of
his
antagonists
and
while
seeming
to
identify
his
own
person
with
the
cause
of
order
rather
identifies
the
cause
of
order
with
his
own
person
besides
this
the
national
assembly
had
subsequently
approved
the
expedition
against
rome
bonaparte
however
had
taken
the
initiative
in
the
affair
after
he
had
led
the
high
priest
samuel
back
into
the
vatican
he
could
hope
as
king
david
to
occupy
the
tuileries
he
had
won
the
over
to
himself
the
riot
of
june
limited
itself
as
we
have
seen
to
a
peaceful
street
procession
there
were
consequently
no
laurels
to
be
won
from
it
nevertheless
in
these
days
poor
in
heroes
and
events
the
party
of
order
converted
this
bloodless
battle
into
a
second
austerlitz
tribune
and
press
lauded
the
army
as
the
power
of
order
against
the
popular
multitude
and
the
impotence
of
anarchy
and
changarnier
as
the
bulwark
of
society
a
mystification
that
he
finally
believed
in
himself
underhand
however
the
corps
that
seemed
doubtful
were
removed
from
paris
the
regiments
whose
suffrage
had
turned
out
most
democratic
were
banished
from
france
to
algiers
the
restless
heads
among
the
troops
were
consigned
to
penal
quarters
finally
the
shutting
out
of
the
press
from
the
barracks
and
of
the
barracks
from
contact
with
the
citizens
was
systematically
carried
out
we
stand
here
at
the
critical
turning
point
in
the
history
of
the
french
national
guard
in
it
had
decided
the
downfall
of
the
restoration
under
louis
philippe
every
riot
failed
at
which
the
national
guard
stood
on
the
side
of
the
troops
when
in
the
february
days
of
it
showed
itself
passive
against
the
uprising
and
doubtful
toward
louis
philippe
himself
he
gave
himself
up
for
lost
thus
the
conviction
cast
root
that
a
revolution
could
not
win
without
nor
the
army
against
the
national
guard
this
was
the
superstitious
faith
of
the
army
in
bourgeois
omnipotence
the
june
days
of
when
the
whole
national
guard
jointly
with
the
regular
troops
threw
down
the
insurrection
had
confirmed
the
superstition
after
the
inauguration
of
administration
the
position
of
the
national
guard
sank
somewhat
through
the
unconstitutional
joining
of
their
command
with
the
command
of
the
first
military
division
in
the
person
of
changarnier
as
the
command
of
the
national
guard
appeared
here
merely
an
attribute
of
the
military
so
did
the
guard
itself
appear
only
as
an
appendage
of
the
regular
troops
finally
on
june
the
national
guard
was
broken
up
not
through
its
partial
dissolution
only
that
from
that
date
forward
was
periodically
repeated
at
all
points
of
france
leaving
only
wrecks
of
its
former
self
behind
the
demonstration
of
june
was
above
all
a
demonstration
of
the
national
guards
true
they
had
not
carried
their
arms
but
they
had
carried
their
uniforms
against
the
army
and
the
talisman
lay
just
in
these
uniforms
the
army
then
learned
that
this
uniform
was
but
a
woolen
rag
like
any
other
the
spell
was
broken
in
the
june
days
of
bourgeoisie
and
small
traders
were
united
as
national
guard
with
the
army
against
the
proletariat
on
june
the
bourgeoisie
had
the
small
national
guard
broken
up
on
december
the
national
guard
of
the
bourgeoisie
itself
vanished
and
bonaparte
attested
the
fact
when
he
subsequently
signed
the
decree
for
its
disbandment
thus
the
bourgeoisie
had
itself
broken
its
last
weapon
against
the
army
from
the
moment
when
the
small
traders
class
no
longer
stood
as
a
vassal
behind
but
as
a
rebel
before
it
indeed
it
was
bound
to
do
so
as
it
was
bound
to
destroy
with
its
own
hand
all
its
means
of
defence
against
absolutism
so
soon
as
itself
was
absolute
in
the
meantime
the
party
of
order
celebrated
the
recovery
of
a
power
that
seemed
lost
in
only
in
order
that
freed
from
its
trammels
in
it
be
found
again
through
invectives
against
the
republic
and
the
constitution
through
the
malediction
of
all
future
present
and
past
revolutions
that
one
included
which
its
own
leaders
had
made
and
finally
in
laws
by
which
the
press
was
gagged
the
right
of
association
destroyed
and
the
stage
of
siege
regulated
as
an
organic
institution
the
national
assembly
then
adjourned
from
the
middle
of
august
to
the
middle
of
october
after
it
had
appointed
a
permanent
committee
for
the
period
of
its
absence
during
these
vacations
the
legitimists
intrigued
with
ems
the
orleanists
with
claremont
bonaparte
through
princely
excursions
the
departmental
councilmen
in
conferences
over
the
revision
of
the
constitution
occurrences
all
of
which
recurred
regularly
at
the
periodical
vacations
of
the
national
assembly
and
upon
which
i
shall
not
enter
until
they
have
matured
into
events
be
it
here
only
observed
that
the
national
assembly
was
impolitic
in
vanishing
from
the
stage
for
long
intervals
and
leaving
in
view
at
the
head
of
the
republic
only
one
however
sorry
figure
louis
bonaparte
while
to
the
public
scandal
the
party
of
order
broke
up
into
its
own
royalist
component
parts
that
pursued
their
conflicting
aspirations
after
the
restoration
as
often
as
during
these
vacations
the
confusing
noise
of
the
parliament
was
hushed
and
its
body
was
dissolved
in
the
nation
it
was
unmistakably
shown
that
only
one
thing
was
still
wanting
to
complete
the
true
figure
of
the
republic
to
make
the
vacation
of
the
national
assembly
permanent
and
substitute
its
inscription
liberty
equality
fraternity
by
the
unequivocal
words
infantry
cavalry
artillery
iv
the
national
assembly
reconvened
in
the
middle
of
october
on
november
bonaparte
surprised
it
with
a
message
in
which
he
announced
the
dismissal
of
the
ministry
and
the
framing
of
a
new
never
have
lackeys
been
chased
from
service
with
less
ceremony
than
bonaparte
did
his
ministers
the
kicks
that
were
eventually
destined
for
the
national
assembly
barrot
company
received
in
the
meantime
the
barrot
ministry
was
as
we
have
seen
composed
of
legitimists
and
orleanists
it
was
a
ministry
of
the
party
of
order
bonaparte
needed
that
ministry
in
order
to
dissolve
the
republican
constituent
assembly
to
effect
the
expedition
against
rome
and
to
break
up
the
democratic
party
he
had
seemingly
eclipsed
himself
behind
this
ministry
yielded
the
reins
to
the
hands
of
the
party
of
order
and
assumed
the
modest
mask
which
under
louis
philippe
had
been
worn
by
the
responsible
overseer
of
the
newspapers
the
mask
of
homme
de
paille
man
of
straw
now
he
threw
off
the
mask
it
being
no
longer
the
light
curtain
behind
which
he
could
conceal
but
the
iron
mask
which
prevented
him
from
revealing
his
own
physiognomy
he
had
instituted
the
barrot
ministry
in
order
to
break
up
the
republican
national
assembly
in
the
name
of
the
party
of
order
he
now
dismissed
it
in
order
to
declare
his
own
name
independent
of
the
parliament
of
the
party
of
order
there
was
no
want
of
plausible
pretexts
for
this
dismissal
the
barrot
ministry
had
neglected
even
the
forms
of
decency
that
would
have
allowed
the
president
of
the
republic
to
appear
as
a
power
along
with
the
national
assembly
for
instance
during
the
vacation
of
the
national
assembly
bonaparte
published
a
letter
to
edgar
ney
in
which
he
seemed
to
disapprove
the
liberal
attitude
of
the
pope
just
as
in
opposition
to
the
constitutive
assembly
he
had
published
a
letter
in
which
he
praised
oudinot
for
his
attack
upon
the
roman
republic
when
the
national
assembly
came
to
vote
on
the
budget
for
the
roman
expedition
victor
hugo
out
of
pretended
liberalism
brought
up
that
letter
for
discussion
the
party
of
order
drowned
this
notion
of
bonaparte
under
exclamations
of
contempt
and
incredulity
as
though
notions
of
bonaparte
could
not
possibly
have
any
political
weight
and
none
of
the
ministers
took
up
the
gauntlet
for
him
on
another
occasion
barrot
with
his
hollow
pathos
dropped
from
the
speakers
tribune
in
the
assembly
words
of
indignation
upon
the
abominable
machinations
which
according
to
him
went
on
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
president
finally
while
the
ministry
obtained
from
the
national
assembly
a
widow
pension
for
the
duchess
of
orleans
it
denied
every
motion
to
raise
the
presidential
civil
list
and
in
bonaparte
be
it
always
remembered
the
imperial
pretender
was
so
closely
blended
with
the
impecunious
adventurer
that
the
great
idea
of
his
being
destined
to
restore
the
empire
was
ever
supplemented
by
that
other
that
the
french
people
was
destined
to
pay
his
debts
the
ministry
was
the
first
and
last
parliamentary
ministry
that
bonaparte
called
into
life
its
dismissal
marks
accordingly
a
decisive
period
with
the
ministry
the
party
of
order
lost
never
to
regain
an
indispensable
post
to
the
maintenance
of
the
parliamentary
regime
the
handle
to
the
executive
power
it
is
readily
understood
that
in
a
country
like
france
where
the
executive
disposes
over
an
army
of
more
than
half
a
million
and
consequently
keeps
permanently
a
large
mass
of
interests
and
existences
in
the
completest
dependence
upon
itself
where
the
government
surrounds
controls
regulates
supervises
and
guards
society
from
its
mightiest
acts
of
national
life
down
to
its
most
insignificant
motions
from
its
common
life
down
to
the
private
life
of
each
individual
where
due
to
such
extraordinary
centralization
this
body
of
parasites
acquires
a
ubiquity
and
omniscience
a
quickened
capacity
for
motion
and
rapidity
that
finds
an
analogue
only
in
the
helpless
lack
of
in
the
unstrung
weakness
of
the
body
social
itself
that
in
such
a
country
the
national
assembly
lost
with
the
control
of
the
ministerial
posts
all
real
influence
unless
it
simultaneously
simplified
the
administration
if
possible
reduced
the
army
of
and
finally
allowed
society
and
public
opinion
to
establish
its
own
organs
independent
of
government
censorship
but
the
material
interest
of
the
french
bourgeoisie
is
most
intimately
bound
up
in
maintenance
of
just
such
a
large
and
extensively
ramified
governmental
machine
there
the
bourgeoisie
provides
for
its
own
superfluous
membership
and
supplies
in
the
shape
of
government
salaries
what
it
can
not
pocket
in
the
form
of
profit
interest
rent
and
fees
on
the
other
hand
its
political
interests
daily
compel
it
to
increase
the
power
of
repression
the
means
and
the
personnel
of
the
government
it
is
at
the
same
time
forced
to
conduct
an
uninterrupted
warfare
against
public
opinion
and
full
of
suspicion
to
hamstring
and
lame
the
independent
organs
of
society
whenever
it
does
not
succeed
in
amputating
them
wholly
thus
the
bourgeoisie
of
france
was
forced
by
its
own
class
attitude
on
the
one
hand
to
destroy
the
conditions
for
all
parliamentary
power
its
own
included
and
on
the
other
to
render
irresistible
the
executive
power
that
stood
hostile
to
it
the
new
ministry
was
called
the
ministry
not
that
general
had
gained
the
rank
of
ministerial
president
along
with
barrot
bonaparte
abolished
this
dignity
which
it
must
be
granted
condemned
the
president
of
the
republic
to
the
legal
nothingness
of
a
constitutional
kind
of
a
constitutional
king
at
that
without
throne
and
crown
without
sceptre
and
without
sword
without
irresponsibility
without
the
imperishable
possession
of
the
highest
dignity
in
the
state
and
what
was
most
untoward
of
all
without
a
civil
list
the
ministry
numbered
only
one
man
of
parliamentary
reputation
the
jew
fould
one
of
the
most
notorious
members
of
the
high
finance
to
him
fell
the
portfolio
of
finance
turn
to
the
paris
stock
quotations
and
it
will
be
found
that
from
november
french
stocks
fall
and
rise
with
the
falling
and
rising
of
the
bonapartist
shares
while
bonaparte
had
thus
found
his
ally
in
the
bourse
he
at
the
same
time
took
possession
of
the
police
through
the
appointment
of
carlier
as
prefect
of
police
but
the
consequences
of
the
change
of
ministry
could
reveal
themselves
only
in
the
course
of
events
so
far
bonaparte
had
taken
only
one
step
forward
to
be
all
the
more
glaringly
driven
back
upon
his
harsh
message
followed
the
most
servile
declarations
of
submissiveness
to
the
national
assembly
as
often
as
the
ministers
made
timid
attempts
to
introduce
his
own
personal
hobbies
as
bills
they
themselves
seemed
unwilling
and
compelled
only
by
their
position
to
run
the
comic
errands
of
whose
futility
they
were
convinced
in
advance
as
often
as
bonaparte
blabbed
out
his
plans
behind
the
backs
of
his
ministers
and
sported
his
idees
napoleoniennes
napoleonic
ideas
his
own
ministers
disavowed
him
from
the
speakers
tribune
in
the
national
assembly
his
aspirations
after
usurpation
seemed
to
become
audible
only
to
the
end
that
the
ironical
laughter
of
his
adversaries
should
not
die
out
he
deported
himself
like
an
unappreciated
genius
whom
the
world
takes
for
a
simpleton
never
did
lie
enjoy
in
fuller
measure
the
contempt
of
all
classes
than
at
this
period
never
did
the
bourgeoisie
rule
more
absolutely
never
did
it
more
boastfully
display
the
insignia
of
sovereignty
it
is
not
here
my
purpose
to
write
the
history
of
its
legislative
activity
which
is
summed
up
in
two
laws
passed
during
this
period
the
law
reestablishing
the
duty
on
wine
and
the
laws
on
education
to
suppress
infidelity
while
the
drinking
of
wine
was
made
difficult
to
the
frenchmen
all
the
more
bounteously
was
the
water
of
pure
life
poured
out
to
them
although
in
the
law
on
the
duty
on
wine
the
bourgeoisie
declares
the
old
hated
french
tariff
system
to
be
inviolable
it
sought
by
means
of
the
laws
on
education
to
secure
the
old
good
will
of
the
masses
that
made
the
former
bearable
one
wonders
to
see
the
orleanists
the
liberal
bourgeois
these
old
apostles
of
voltarianism
and
of
eclectic
philosophy
entrusting
the
supervision
of
the
french
intellect
to
their
hereditary
enemies
the
jesuits
but
while
orleanists
and
legitimists
could
part
company
on
the
question
of
the
pretender
to
the
crown
they
understood
full
well
that
their
joint
reign
dictated
the
joining
of
the
means
of
oppression
of
two
distinct
epochs
that
the
means
of
subjugation
of
the
july
monarchy
had
to
be
supplemented
with
and
strengthened
by
the
means
of
subjugation
of
the
restoration
the
farmers
deceived
in
all
their
expectations
more
than
ever
ground
down
by
the
law
scale
of
the
price
of
corn
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
by
the
growing
load
of
taxation
and
mortgages
began
to
stir
in
the
departments
they
were
answered
by
the
systematic
baiting
of
the
school
masters
whom
the
government
subjected
to
the
clergy
by
the
systematic
baiting
of
the
mayors
whom
it
subjected
to
the
prefects
and
by
a
system
of
espionage
to
which
all
were
subjected
in
paris
and
the
large
towns
the
reaction
itself
carries
the
physiognomy
of
its
own
epoch
it
irritates
more
than
it
cows
in
the
country
it
becomes
low
moan
petty
tiresome
vexatious
in
a
word
it
becomes
gensdarme
it
is
easily
understood
how
three
years
of
the
gensdarme
regime
sanctified
by
the
regime
of
the
clergyman
was
bound
to
demoralize
unripe
masses
whatever
the
mass
of
passion
and
declamation
that
the
party
of
order
expended
from
the
speakers
tribune
in
the
national
assembly
against
the
minority
its
speech
remained
monosyllabic
like
that
of
the
christian
whose
speech
was
to
be
aye
aye
nay
nay
it
was
monosyllabic
whether
from
the
tribune
or
the
press
dull
as
a
conundrum
whose
solution
is
known
beforehand
whether
the
question
was
the
right
of
petition
or
the
duty
on
wine
the
liberty
of
the
press
or
free
trade
clubs
or
municipal
laws
protection
of
individual
freedom
or
the
regulation
of
national
economy
the
slogan
returns
ever
again
the
theme
is
monotonously
the
same
the
verdict
is
ever
ready
and
unchanged
socialism
even
bourgeois
liberalism
is
pronounced
socialistic
socialistic
alike
is
pronounced
popular
education
and
likewise
socialistic
national
financial
reform
it
was
socialistic
to
build
a
railroad
where
already
a
canal
was
and
it
was
socialistic
to
defend
oneself
with
a
stick
when
attacked
with
a
sword
this
was
not
a
mere
form
of
speech
a
fashion
nor
yet
party
tactics
the
bourgeoisie
perceives
correctly
that
all
the
weapons
which
it
forged
against
feudalism
turn
their
edges
against
itself
that
all
the
means
of
education
which
it
brought
forth
rebel
against
its
own
civilization
that
all
the
gods
which
it
made
have
fallen
away
from
it
it
understands
that
all
its
citizens
rights
and
progressive
organs
assail
and
menace
its
class
rule
both
in
its
social
foundation
and
its
political
superstructure
consequently
have
become
socialistic
it
justly
scents
in
this
menace
and
assault
the
secret
of
socialism
whose
meaning
and
tendency
it
estimates
more
correctly
than
the
spurious
socialism
is
capable
of
estimating
itself
and
which
consequently
is
unable
to
understand
how
it
is
that
the
bourgeoisie
obdurately
shuts
up
its
ears
to
it
alike
whether
it
sentimentally
whines
about
the
sufferings
of
humanity
or
announces
in
christian
style
the
millennium
and
universal
brotherhood
or
twaddles
humanistically
about
the
soul
culture
and
freedom
or
doctrinally
matches
out
a
system
of
harmony
and
wellbeing
for
all
classes
what
however
the
bourgeoisie
does
not
understand
is
the
consequence
that
its
own
parliamentary
regime
its
own
political
reign
is
also
of
necessity
bound
to
fall
under
the
general
ban
of
socialistic
so
long
as
the
rule
of
the
bourgeoisie
is
not
fully
organized
has
not
acquired
its
purely
political
character
the
contrast
with
the
other
classes
can
not
come
into
view
in
all
its
sharpness
and
where
it
does
come
into
view
it
can
not
take
that
dangerous
turn
that
converts
every
conflict
with
the
government
into
a
conflict
with
capital
when
however
the
french
bourgeoisie
began
to
realize
in
every
pulsation
of
society
a
menace
to
peace
how
could
it
at
the
head
of
society
pretend
to
uphold
the
regime
of
unrest
its
own
regime
the
parliamentary
regime
which
according
to
the
expression
of
one
of
its
own
orators
lives
in
struggle
and
through
struggle
the
parliamentary
regime
lives
on
discussion
how
can
it
forbid
discussion
every
single
interest
every
single
social
institution
is
there
converted
into
general
thoughts
is
treated
as
a
thought
how
could
any
interest
or
institution
claim
to
be
above
thought
and
impose
itself
as
an
article
of
faith
the
conflict
in
the
tribune
calls
forth
the
conflict
of
the
rowdies
in
the
press
the
debating
club
in
parliament
is
necessarily
supplemented
by
debating
clubs
in
the
salons
and
the
barrooms
the
representatives
who
are
constantly
appealing
to
popular
opinion
justify
popular
opinion
in
expressing
its
real
opinion
in
petitions
the
parliamentary
regime
leaves
everything
to
the
decision
of
majorities
how
can
the
large
majorities
beyond
parliament
be
expected
not
to
wish
to
decide
if
from
above
they
hear
the
fiddle
screeching
what
else
is
to
be
expected
than
that
those
below
should
dance
accordingly
by
now
persecuting
as
socialist
what
formerly
it
had
celebrated
as
liberal
the
bourgeoisie
admits
that
its
own
interest
orders
it
to
raise
itself
above
the
danger
of
self
government
that
in
order
to
restore
rest
to
the
land
its
own
bourgeois
parliament
must
before
all
be
brought
to
rest
that
in
order
to
preserve
its
social
power
unhurt
its
political
power
must
be
broken
that
the
private
bourgeois
can
continue
to
exploit
the
other
classes
and
rejoice
in
property
family
religion
and
order
only
under
the
condition
that
his
own
class
be
condemned
to
the
same
political
nullity
of
the
other
classes
that
in
order
to
save
their
purse
the
crown
must
be
knocked
off
their
heads
and
the
sword
that
was
to
shield
them
must
at
the
same
time
be
hung
over
their
heads
as
a
sword
of
damocles
in
the
domain
of
general
bourgeois
interests
the
national
assembly
proved
itself
so
barren
that
for
instance
the
discussion
over
the
railroad
opened
in
the
winter
of
was
not
yet
ripe
for
a
vote
on
december
wherever
it
did
not
oppress
or
was
reactionary
the
bourgeoisie
was
smitten
with
incurable
barrenness
while
bonaparte
ministry
either
sought
to
take
the
initiative
of
laws
in
the
spirit
of
the
party
of
order
or
even
exaggerated
their
severity
in
their
enforcement
and
administration
he
on
his
part
sought
to
win
popularity
by
means
of
childishly
silly
propositions
to
exhibit
the
contrast
between
himself
and
the
national
assembly
and
to
hint
at
a
secret
plan
held
in
reserve
and
only
through
circumstances
temporarily
prevented
from
disclosing
its
hidden
treasures
to
the
french
people
of
this
nature
was
the
proposition
to
decree
a
daily
extra
pay
of
four
sous
to
the
so
likewise
the
proposition
for
a
word
of
honor
loan
bank
for
to
have
money
given
and
money
borrowed
that
was
the
perspective
that
he
hoped
to
cajole
the
masses
with
presents
and
loans
to
that
was
limited
the
financial
wisdom
of
the
slums
the
high
as
well
as
the
low
to
that
were
limited
the
springs
which
bonaparte
knew
how
to
set
in
motion
never
did
pretender
speculate
more
dully
upon
the
dullness
of
the
masses
again
and
again
did
the
national
assembly
fly
into
a
passion
at
these
unmistakable
attempts
to
win
popularity
at
its
expense
and
at
the
growing
danger
that
this
adventurer
lashed
on
by
debts
and
unrestrained
by
reputation
might
venture
upon
some
desperate
act
the
strained
relations
between
the
party
of
order
and
the
president
had
taken
on
a
threatening
aspect
when
an
unforeseen
event
threw
him
back
rueful
into
its
arms
we
mean
the
supplementary
elections
of
march
these
elections
took
place
to
fill
the
vacancies
created
in
the
national
assembly
after
june
by
imprisonment
and
exile
paris
elected
only
candidates
it
even
united
the
largest
vote
upon
one
of
the
insurgents
of
june
deflotte
in
this
way
the
small
traders
world
of
paris
now
allied
with
the
proletariat
revenged
itself
for
the
defeat
of
june
it
seemed
to
have
disappeared
from
the
field
of
battle
at
the
hour
of
danger
only
to
step
on
it
again
at
a
more
favorable
opportunity
with
increased
forces
for
the
fray
and
with
a
bolder
war
cry
a
circumstance
seemed
to
heighten
the
danger
of
this
electoral
victory
the
army
voted
in
paris
for
a
june
insurgent
against
lahitte
a
minister
of
bonaparte
and
in
the
departments
mostly
for
the
candidates
of
the
mountain
who
there
also
although
not
as
decisively
as
in
paris
maintained
the
upper
hand
over
their
adversaries
bonaparte
suddenly
saw
himself
again
face
to
face
with
the
revolution
as
on
january
as
on
june
on
may
he
vanished
again
behind
the
party
of
order
he
bent
low
he
timidly
apologized
he
offered
to
appoint
any
ministry
whatever
at
the
behest
of
the
parliamentary
majority
he
even
implored
the
orleanist
and
legitimist
party
leaders
the
thiers
berryers
broglies
moles
in
short
the
burgraves
to
take
hold
of
the
helm
of
state
in
person
the
party
of
order
did
not
know
how
to
utilize
this
opportunity
that
was
never
to
return
instead
of
boldly
taking
possession
of
the
proffered
power
it
did
not
even
force
bonaparte
to
restore
the
ministry
dismissed
on
november
it
contented
itself
with
humiliating
him
with
its
pardon
and
with
affiliating
baroche
to
the
ministry
this
baroche
had
as
public
prosecutor
stormed
before
the
high
court
at
bourges
once
against
the
revolutionists
of
may
another
time
against
the
democrats
of
june
both
times
on
the
charge
of
attentats
against
the
national
assembly
none
of
bonaparte
ministers
contributed
later
more
towards
the
degradation
of
the
national
assembly
and
after
december
we
meet
him
again
as
the
comfortably
stalled
and
dearly
paid
of
the
senate
he
had
spat
into
the
soup
of
the
revolutionists
for
bonaparte
to
eat
it
on
its
part
the
social
democratic
party
seemed
only
to
look
for
pretexts
in
order
to
make
its
own
victory
doubtful
and
to
dull
its
edge
vidal
one
of
the
newly
elected
paris
representatives
was
returned
for
strassburg
also
he
was
induced
to
decline
the
seat
for
paris
and
accept
the
one
for
strassburg
thus
instead
of
giving
a
definite
character
to
their
victory
at
the
hustings
and
thereby
compelling
the
party
of
order
forthwith
to
contest
it
in
parliament
instead
of
thus
driving
the
foe
to
battle
at
the
season
of
popular
enthusiasm
and
of
a
favorable
temper
in
the
army
the
democratic
party
tired
out
paris
with
a
new
campaign
during
the
months
of
march
and
april
it
allowed
the
excited
popular
passions
to
wear
themselves
out
in
this
second
provisional
electoral
play
it
allowed
the
revolutionary
vigor
to
satiate
itself
with
constitutional
successes
and
lose
its
breath
in
petty
intrigues
hollow
declamation
and
sham
moves
it
gave
the
bourgeoisie
time
to
collect
itself
and
make
its
preparations
finally
it
allowed
the
significance
of
the
march
elections
to
find
a
sentimentally
weakening
commentary
at
the
subsequent
april
election
in
the
victory
of
eugene
sue
in
one
word
it
turned
the
of
march
into
an
april
fool
the
parliamentary
majority
perceived
the
weakness
of
its
adversary
its
seventeen
burgraves
bonaparte
had
left
to
it
the
direction
of
and
responsibility
for
the
attack
framed
a
new
election
law
the
moving
of
which
was
entrusted
to
faucher
who
had
applied
for
the
honor
on
may
he
introduced
the
new
law
whereby
universal
suffrage
was
abolished
a
three
years
residence
in
the
election
district
imposed
as
a
condition
for
voting
and
finally
the
proof
of
this
residence
made
dependent
for
the
upon
the
testimony
of
his
employer
as
revolutionarily
as
the
democrats
had
agitated
and
stormed
during
the
constitutional
struggles
so
constitutionally
did
they
now
when
it
was
imperative
to
attest
arms
in
hand
the
earnestness
of
their
late
electoral
victories
preach
order
majestic
calmness
lawful
conduct
blind
submission
to
the
will
of
the
which
revealed
itself
as
law
during
the
debate
the
mountain
put
the
party
of
order
to
shame
by
maintaining
the
passionless
attitude
of
the
burger
who
upholds
the
principle
of
law
against
revolutionary
passions
and
by
twitting
the
party
of
order
with
the
fearful
reproach
of
proceeding
in
a
revolutionary
manner
even
the
newly
elected
deputies
took
pains
to
prove
by
their
decent
and
thoughtful
deportment
what
an
act
of
misjudgment
it
was
to
decry
them
as
anarchists
or
explain
their
election
as
a
victory
of
the
revolution
the
new
election
law
was
passed
on
may
the
mountain
contented
itself
with
smuggling
a
protest
into
the
pockets
of
the
president
of
the
assembly
to
the
election
law
followed
a
new
press
law
whereby
the
revolutionary
press
was
completely
done
away
with
it
had
deserved
its
fate
the
national
and
the
presse
two
bourgeois
organs
remained
after
this
deluge
the
extreme
outposts
of
the
revolution
we
have
seen
how
during
march
and
april
the
democratic
leaders
did
everything
to
involve
the
people
of
paris
in
a
sham
battle
and
how
after
may
they
did
everything
to
keep
it
away
from
a
real
battle
we
may
not
here
forget
that
the
year
was
one
of
the
most
brilliant
years
of
industrial
and
commercial
prosperity
consequently
that
the
parisian
proletariat
was
completely
employed
but
the
election
law
of
may
excluded
them
from
all
participation
in
political
power
it
cut
the
field
of
battle
itself
from
under
them
it
threw
the
workingmen
back
into
the
state
of
pariahs
which
they
had
occupied
before
the
february
revolution
in
allowing
themselves
in
sight
of
such
an
occurrence
to
be
led
by
the
democrats
and
in
forgetting
the
revolutionary
interests
of
their
class
through
temporary
comfort
the
workingmen
abdicated
the
honor
of
being
a
conquering
power
they
submitted
to
their
fate
they
proved
that
the
defeat
of
june
had
incapacitated
them
from
resistance
for
many
a
year
to
come
finally
that
the
historic
process
must
again
for
the
time
being
proceed
over
their
heads
as
to
the
small
traders
democracy
which
on
june
had
cried
out
if
they
but
dare
to
assail
universal
suffrage
then
then
we
will
show
who
we
are
they
now
consoled
themselves
with
the
thought
that
the
blow
which
had
struck
them
was
no
blow
at
all
and
that
the
law
of
may
was
no
law
on
may
according
to
them
every
frenchman
would
appear
at
the
hustings
in
one
hand
the
ballot
in
the
other
the
sword
with
this
prophecy
they
set
their
hearts
at
ease
finally
the
army
was
punished
by
its
superiors
for
the
elections
of
may
and
april
as
it
was
punished
for
the
election
of
may
this
time
however
it
said
to
itself
determinately
the
revolution
shall
not
cheat
us
a
third
time
the
law
of
may
was
the
coup
of
the
bourgeoisie
all
its
previous
conquests
over
the
revolution
had
only
a
temporary
character
they
became
uncertain
the
moment
the
national
assembly
stepped
off
the
stage
they
depended
upon
the
accident
of
general
elections
and
the
history
of
the
elections
since
proved
irrefutably
that
in
the
same
measure
as
the
actual
reign
of
the
bourgeoisie
gathered
strength
its
moral
reign
over
the
masses
wore
off
universal
suffrage
pronounced
itself
on
may
pointedly
against
the
reign
of
the
bourgeoisie
the
bourgeoisie
answered
with
the
banishment
of
universal
suffrage
the
law
of
may
was
accordingly
one
of
the
necessities
of
the
class
struggle
on
the
other
hand
the
constitution
required
a
minimum
of
two
million
votes
for
the
valid
ejection
of
the
president
of
the
republic
if
none
of
the
presidential
candidates
polled
this
minimum
then
the
national
assembly
was
to
elect
the
president
out
of
the
three
candidates
polling
the
highest
votes
at
the
time
that
the
constitutive
body
made
this
law
ten
million
voters
were
registered
on
the
election
rolls
in
its
opinion
accordingly
of
the
qualified
voters
sufficed
to
make
a
choice
for
president
valid
the
law
of
may
struck
at
least
three
million
voters
off
the
rolls
reduced
the
number
of
qualified
voters
to
seven
millions
and
yet
not
withstanding
it
kept
the
lawful
minimum
at
two
millions
for
the
election
of
a
president
accordingly
it
raised
the
lawful
minimum
from
a
fifth
to
almost
a
third
of
the
qualified
voters
it
did
all
it
could
to
smuggle
the
presidential
election
out
of
the
hands
of
the
people
into
those
of
the
national
assembly
thus
by
the
election
law
of
may
the
party
of
order
seemed
to
have
doubly
secured
its
empire
in
that
it
placed
the
election
of
both
the
national
assembly
and
the
president
of
the
republic
in
the
keeping
of
the
stable
portion
of
society
v
the
strife
immediately
broke
out
again
between
the
national
assembly
and
bonaparte
so
soon
as
the
revolutionary
crisis
was
weathered
and
universal
suffrage
was
abolished
the
constitution
had
fixed
the
salary
of
bonaparte
at
francs
barely
half
a
year
after
his
installation
he
succeeded
in
raising
this
sum
to
its
double
odillon
barrot
had
wrung
from
the
constitutive
assembly
a
yearly
allowance
of
francs
for
representation
expenses
after
june
bonaparte
hinted
at
similar
solicitations
to
which
however
barrot
then
turned
a
deaf
ear
now
after
may
he
forthwith
utilized
the
favorable
moment
and
caused
his
ministers
to
move
a
civil
list
of
three
millions
in
the
national
assembly
a
long
adventurous
vagabond
career
had
gifted
him
with
the
best
developed
antennae
for
feeling
out
the
weak
moments
when
he
could
venture
upon
squeezing
money
from
his
bourgeois
he
carried
on
regular
blackmail
the
national
assembly
had
maimed
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
with
his
aid
and
his
knowledge
he
now
threatened
to
denounce
its
crime
to
the
tribunal
of
the
people
if
it
did
not
pull
out
its
purse
and
buy
his
silence
with
three
millions
annually
it
had
robbed
three
million
frenchmen
of
the
suffrage
for
every
frenchman
thrown
out
of
circulation
he
demanded
a
franc
in
circulation
he
the
elect
of
six
million
demanded
indemnity
for
the
votes
he
had
been
subsequently
cheated
of
the
committee
of
the
national
assembly
turned
the
importunate
fellow
away
the
bonapartist
press
threatened
could
the
national
assembly
break
with
the
president
of
the
republic
at
a
time
when
it
had
broken
definitely
and
on
principle
with
the
mass
of
the
nation
it
rejected
the
annual
civil
list
but
granted
for
this
once
an
allowance
of
francs
thus
it
made
itself
guilty
of
the
double
weakness
of
granting
the
money
and
at
the
same
time
showing
by
its
anger
that
it
did
so
only
unwillingly
we
shall
presently
see
to
what
use
bonaparte
put
the
money
after
this
aggravating
that
followed
upon
the
heels
of
the
abolition
of
universal
suffrage
and
in
which
bonaparte
exchanged
his
humble
attitude
of
the
days
of
the
crisis
of
march
and
april
for
one
of
defiant
impudence
towards
the
usurping
parliament
the
national
assembly
adjourned
for
three
months
from
august
to
november
it
left
behind
in
its
place
a
permanent
committee
of
members
that
contained
no
bonapartist
but
did
contain
a
few
moderate
republicans
the
permanent
committee
of
the
year
had
numbered
only
men
of
order
and
bonapartists
at
that
time
however
the
party
of
order
declared
itself
in
permanence
against
the
revolution
now
the
parliamentary
republic
declared
itself
in
permanence
against
the
president
after
the
law
of
may
only
this
rival
still
confronted
the
party
of
order
when
the
national
assembly
reconvened
in
november
instead
of
its
former
petty
skirmishes
with
the
president
a
great
headlong
struggle
a
struggle
for
life
between
the
two
powers
seemed
to
have
become
inevitable
as
in
the
year
the
party
of
order
had
during
this
year
vacation
dissolved
into
its
two
separate
factions
each
occupied
with
its
own
restoration
intrigues
which
had
received
new
impetus
from
the
death
of
louis
philippe
the
legitimist
king
henry
v
had
even
appointed
a
regular
ministry
that
resided
in
paris
and
in
which
sat
members
of
the
permanent
committee
hence
bonaparte
was
on
his
part
justified
in
making
tours
through
the
french
departments
and
according
to
the
disposition
of
the
towns
that
he
happened
to
be
gladdening
with
his
presence
some
times
covertly
other
times
more
openly
blabbing
out
his
own
restoration
plans
and
gaining
votes
for
himself
on
these
excursions
which
the
large
official
moniteur
and
the
small
private
moniteurs
of
bonaparte
were
of
course
bound
to
celebrate
as
triumphal
marches
he
was
constantly
accompanied
by
affiliated
members
of
the
society
of
december
this
society
dated
from
the
year
under
the
pretext
of
founding
a
benevolent
association
the
of
paris
was
organized
into
secret
sections
each
section
led
by
bonapartist
agents
with
a
bonapartist
general
at
the
head
of
all
along
with
ruined
roues
of
questionable
means
of
support
and
questionable
antecedents
along
with
the
foul
and
dregs
of
the
bourgeoisie
there
were
vagabonds
dismissed
soldiers
discharged
convicts
runaway
galley
slaves
sharpers
jugglers
lazzaroni
pickpockets
performers
gamblers
procurers
keepers
of
disorderly
houses
porters
literati
organ
grinders
rag
pickers
scissors
grinders
tinkers
beggars
in
short
that
whole
undefined
dissolute
mass
that
the
frenchmen
style
la
boheme
with
this
kindred
element
bonaparte
formed
the
stock
of
the
society
of
december
a
benevolent
association
in
so
far
as
like
bonaparte
himself
all
its
members
felt
the
need
of
being
benevolent
to
themselves
at
the
expense
of
the
toiling
nation
the
bonaparte
who
here
constitutes
himself
chief
of
the
who
only
here
finds
again
in
plenteous
form
the
interests
which
he
personally
pursues
who
in
this
refuse
offal
and
wreck
of
all
classes
recognizes
the
only
class
upon
which
he
can
depend
unconditionally
this
is
the
real
bonaparte
the
bonaparte
without
qualification
an
old
and
crafty
roue
he
looks
upon
the
historic
life
of
nations
upon
their
great
and
public
acts
as
comedies
in
the
ordinary
sense
as
a
carnival
where
the
great
costumes
words
and
postures
serve
only
as
masks
for
the
pettiest
chicaneries
so
on
the
occasion
of
his
expedition
against
strassburg
when
a
trained
swiss
vulture
impersonated
the
napoleonic
eagle
so
again
on
the
occasion
of
his
raid
upon
boulogne
when
he
struck
a
few
london
lackeys
into
french
uniform
they
impersonated
the
army
under
the
reign
of
louis
philippe
bonaparte
made
two
attempts
to
restore
the
throne
of
napoleon
one
in
october
in
an
expedition
from
switzerland
upon
strassburg
and
one
in
august
in
an
expedition
from
england
upon
boulogne
and
so
now
in
his
society
of
december
he
collects
loafers
who
are
to
impersonate
the
people
as
snug
the
joiner
does
the
lion
at
a
period
when
the
bourgeoisie
itself
is
playing
the
sheerest
comedy
but
in
the
most
solemn
manner
in
the
world
without
doing
violence
to
any
of
the
pedantic
requirements
of
french
dramatic
etiquette
and
is
itself
partly
deceived
by
partly
convinced
of
the
solemnity
of
its
own
public
acts
the
adventurer
who
took
the
comedy
for
simple
comedy
was
bound
to
win
only
after
he
has
removed
his
solemn
opponent
when
he
himself
takes
seriously
his
own
role
of
emperor
and
with
the
napoleonic
mask
on
imagines
he
impersonates
the
real
napoleon
only
then
does
he
become
the
victim
of
his
own
peculiar
conception
of
history
the
serious
clown
who
no
longer
takes
history
for
a
comedy
but
a
comedy
for
history
what
the
national
were
to
the
socialist
workingmen
what
the
gardes
mobiles
were
to
the
bourgeois
republicans
that
was
to
bonaparte
the
society
of
december
a
force
for
partisan
warfare
peculiar
to
himself
on
his
journeys
the
divisions
of
the
society
packed
away
on
the
railroads
improvised
an
audience
for
him
performed
public
enthusiasm
shouted
vive
insulted
and
clubbed
the
republicans
all
of
course
under
the
protection
of
the
police
on
his
return
stages
to
paris
this
rabble
constituted
his
vanguard
it
forestalled
or
dispersed
the
society
of
december
belonged
to
him
it
was
his
own
handiwork
his
own
thought
whatever
else
he
appropriates
the
power
of
circumstances
places
in
his
hands
whatever
else
he
does
either
circumstances
do
for
him
or
he
is
content
to
copy
from
the
deeds
of
others
but
he
posing
before
the
citizens
with
the
official
phrases
about
order
religion
family
property
and
behind
him
the
secret
society
of
skipjacks
and
picaroons
the
society
of
disorder
of
prostitution
and
of
theft
that
is
bonaparte
himself
as
the
original
author
and
the
history
of
the
society
of
december
is
his
own
history
now
then
it
happened
that
representatives
belonging
to
the
party
of
order
occasionally
got
under
the
clubs
of
the
decembrists
nay
more
police
commissioner
yon
who
had
been
assigned
to
the
national
assembly
and
was
charged
with
the
guardianship
of
its
safety
reported
to
the
permanent
committee
upon
the
testimony
of
one
alais
that
a
section
of
the
decembrists
had
decided
on
the
murder
of
general
changarnier
and
of
dupin
the
president
of
the
national
assembly
and
had
already
settled
upon
the
men
to
execute
the
decree
one
can
imagine
the
fright
of
dupin
a
parliamentary
inquest
over
the
society
of
december
the
profanation
of
the
bonapartist
secret
world
now
seemed
inevitable
just
before
the
reconvening
of
the
national
assembly
bonaparte
circumspectly
dissolved
his
society
of
course
on
paper
only
as
late
as
the
end
of
police
prefect
carlier
vainly
sought
in
an
exhaustive
memorial
to
move
him
to
the
real
dissolution
of
the
decembrists
the
society
of
december
was
to
remain
the
private
army
of
bonaparte
until
he
should
have
succeeded
in
converting
the
public
army
into
a
society
of
december
bonaparte
made
the
first
attempt
in
this
direction
shortly
after
the
adjournment
of
the
national
assembly
and
he
did
so
with
the
money
which
he
had
just
wrung
from
it
as
a
fatalist
he
lives
devoted
to
the
conviction
that
there
are
certain
higher
powers
whom
man
particularly
the
soldier
can
not
resist
first
among
these
powers
he
numbers
cigars
and
champagne
cold
poultry
and
accordingly
in
the
apartments
of
the
elysee
he
treated
first
the
officers
and
to
cigars
and
champagne
to
cold
poultry
and
on
october
he
repeats
this
manoeuvre
with
the
rank
and
file
of
the
troops
by
the
review
of
maur
and
on
october
the
same
manoeuvre
again
upon
a
larger
scale
at
the
army
parade
of
satory
the
uncle
bore
in
remembrance
the
campaigns
of
alexander
in
asia
the
nephew
bore
in
remembrance
the
triumphal
marches
of
bacchus
in
the
same
country
alexander
was
indeed
a
demigod
but
bacchus
was
a
god
and
the
patron
deity
at
that
of
the
society
of
december
after
the
review
of
october
the
permanent
committee
summoned
the
minister
of
war
before
it
he
promised
that
such
breaches
of
discipline
should
not
recur
we
have
seen
how
on
october
bonaparte
kept
word
at
both
reviews
changarnier
had
commanded
as
of
the
army
of
paris
he
at
once
member
of
the
permanent
committee
chief
of
the
national
guard
the
savior
of
january
and
june
the
bulwark
of
society
candidate
of
the
party
of
order
for
the
office
of
president
the
suspected
monk
of
two
monarchies
he
had
never
acknowledged
his
subordination
to
the
minister
of
war
had
ever
openly
scoffed
at
the
republican
constitution
and
had
pursued
bonaparte
with
a
protection
that
was
ambiguously
distinguished
now
he
became
zealous
for
the
discipline
in
opposition
to
bonaparte
while
on
october
a
part
of
the
cavalry
cried
vive
napoleon
vivent
les
saucissons
long
live
napoleon
long
live
the
sausages
changarnier
saw
to
it
that
at
least
the
infantry
which
filed
by
under
the
command
of
his
friend
neumeyer
should
observe
an
icy
silence
in
punishment
the
minister
of
war
at
the
instigation
of
bonaparte
deposed
general
neumeyer
from
his
post
in
paris
under
the
pretext
of
providing
for
him
as
of
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
military
divisions
neumeyer
declined
the
exchange
and
had
in
consequence
to
give
his
resignation
on
his
part
changarnier
published
on
november
an
order
wherein
he
forbade
the
troops
to
indulge
while
under
arms
in
any
sort
of
political
cries
or
demonstrations
the
papers
devoted
to
the
elysee
interests
attacked
changarnier
the
papers
of
the
party
of
order
attacked
bonaparte
the
permanent
committee
held
frequent
secret
sessions
at
which
it
was
repeatedly
proposed
to
declare
the
fatherland
in
danger
the
army
seemed
divided
into
two
hostile
camps
with
two
hostile
staffs
one
at
the
elysee
where
bonaparte
the
other
at
the
tuileries
where
changarnier
resided
all
that
seemed
wanting
for
the
signal
of
battle
to
sound
was
the
convening
of
the
national
assembly
the
french
public
looked
upon
the
friction
between
bonaparte
and
changarnier
in
the
light
of
the
english
journalist
who
characterized
it
in
these
words
the
political
servant
girls
of
france
are
mopping
away
the
glowing
lava
of
the
revolution
with
old
mops
and
they
scold
each
other
while
doing
their
work
meanwhile
bonaparte
hastened
to
depose
the
minister
of
war
to
expedite
him
heels
over
head
to
algiers
and
to
appoint
in
his
place
general
schramm
as
minister
of
war
on
november
he
sent
to
the
national
assembly
a
message
of
american
excursiveness
overloaded
with
details
redolent
of
order
athirst
for
conciliation
resignful
to
the
constitution
dealing
with
all
and
everything
only
not
with
the
burning
questions
of
the
moment
as
if
in
passing
he
dropped
the
words
that
according
to
the
express
provisions
of
the
constitution
the
president
alone
disposes
over
the
army
the
message
closed
with
the
following
protestations
france
demands
above
all
things
peace
alone
bound
by
an
oath
i
shall
keep
myself
within
the
narrow
bounds
marked
out
by
it
to
me
as
to
me
elected
by
the
people
and
owing
my
power
to
it
alone
i
shall
always
submit
to
its
lawfully
expressed
will
should
you
at
this
session
decide
upon
the
revision
of
the
constitution
a
constitutional
convention
will
regulate
the
position
of
the
executive
power
if
you
do
not
then
the
people
will
in
solemnly
announce
its
decision
but
whatever
the
solution
may
be
that
the
future
has
in
store
let
us
arrive
at
an
understanding
to
the
end
that
never
may
passion
surprise
or
violence
decide
over
the
fate
of
a
great
nation
that
which
above
all
bespeaks
my
attention
is
not
who
will
in
rule
over
france
but
to
so
devote
the
time
at
my
disposal
that
the
interval
may
pass
by
agitation
and
disturbance
i
have
straightforwardly
opened
my
heart
to
you
you
will
answer
my
frankness
with
your
confidence
my
good
efforts
with
your
god
will
do
the
rest
the
honnete
hypocritically
temperate
language
of
the
bourgeoisie
reveals
its
deep
meaning
in
the
mouth
of
the
ruler
of
the
society
of
december
and
of
the
of
maur
and
satory
the
burgraves
of
the
party
of
order
did
not
for
a
moment
deceive
themselves
on
the
confidence
that
this
unbosoming
deserved
they
were
long
blase
on
oaths
they
numbered
among
themselves
veterans
and
virtuosi
of
perjury
the
passage
about
the
army
did
not
however
escape
them
they
observed
with
annoyance
that
the
message
despite
its
prolix
enumeration
of
the
lately
enacted
laws
passed
with
affected
silence
over
the
most
important
of
all
the
election
law
and
moreover
in
case
no
revision
of
the
constitution
was
held
left
the
choice
of
the
president
in
with
the
people
the
election
law
was
the
to
the
feet
of
the
party
of
order
that
hindered
them
from
walking
and
now
assuredly
from
storming
furthermore
by
the
official
disbandment
of
the
society
of
december
and
the
dismissal
of
the
minister
of
war
bonaparte
had
with
his
own
hands
sacrificed
the
scapegoats
on
the
altar
of
the
fatherland
he
had
turned
off
the
expected
collision
finally
the
party
of
order
itself
anxiously
sought
to
avoid
every
decisive
conflict
with
the
executive
to
weaken
and
to
blur
it
over
fearing
to
lose
its
conquests
over
the
revolution
it
let
its
rival
gather
the
fruits
thereof
france
demands
above
all
things
peace
with
this
language
had
the
party
of
order
been
apostrophizing
the
revolution
since
february
with
this
language
did
bonaparte
message
now
apostrophize
the
party
of
order
france
demands
above
all
things
peace
bonaparte
committed
acts
that
aimed
at
usurpation
but
the
party
of
order
committed
a
disturbance
of
the
peace
if
it
raised
the
hue
and
cry
and
explained
them
hypochrondriacally
the
sausages
of
satory
were
when
nobody
talked
about
them
france
demands
above
all
things
peace
accordingly
bonaparte
demanded
that
he
be
let
alone
and
the
parliamentary
party
was
lamed
with
a
double
fear
the
fear
of
up
the
revolutionary
disturbance
of
the
peace
and
the
fear
of
itself
appearing
as
the
disturber
of
the
peace
in
the
eyes
of
its
own
class
of
the
bourgeosie
seeing
that
above
all
things
france
demanded
peace
the
party
of
order
did
not
dare
after
bonaparte
had
said
peace
in
his
message
to
answer
war
the
public
who
had
promised
to
itself
the
pleasure
of
seeing
great
scenes
of
scandal
at
the
opening
of
the
national
assembly
was
cheated
out
of
its
expectations
the
opposition
deputies
who
demanded
the
submission
of
the
minutes
of
the
permanent
committee
over
the
october
occurrences
were
outvoted
all
debate
that
might
excite
was
fled
from
on
principle
the
labors
of
the
national
assembly
during
november
and
december
were
without
interest
finally
toward
the
end
of
december
began
a
guerilla
warfare
about
certain
prerogatives
of
the
parliament
the
movement
sank
into
the
mire
of
petty
chicaneries
on
the
prerogative
of
the
two
powers
since
with
the
abolition
of
universal
suffrage
the
bourgeoisie
had
done
away
with
the
class
struggle
a
judgment
for
debt
had
been
secured
against
mauguin
one
of
the
representatives
upon
inquiry
by
the
president
of
the
court
the
minister
of
justice
rouher
declared
that
an
order
of
arrest
should
be
made
out
without
delay
manguin
was
accordingly
cast
into
the
debtors
prison
the
national
assembly
bristled
up
when
it
heard
of
the
attentat
it
not
only
ordered
his
immediate
release
but
had
him
forcibly
taken
out
of
clichy
the
same
evening
by
its
own
greffier
in
order
nevertheless
to
shield
its
belief
in
the
sacredness
of
private
property
and
also
with
the
ulterior
thought
of
opening
in
case
of
need
an
asylum
for
troublesome
mountainers
it
declared
the
imprisonment
of
a
representative
for
debt
to
be
permissible
upon
its
previous
consent
it
forgot
to
decree
that
the
president
also
could
be
locked
up
for
debt
by
its
act
it
wiped
out
the
last
semblance
of
inviolability
that
surrounded
the
members
of
its
own
body
it
will
be
remembered
that
upon
the
testimony
of
one
allais
police
commissioner
yon
had
charged
a
section
of
decembrists
with
a
plan
to
murder
dupin
and
changarnier
with
an
eye
upon
that
the
questors
proposed
at
the
very
first
session
that
the
parliament
organize
a
police
force
of
its
own
paid
for
out
of
the
private
budget
of
the
national
assembly
itself
and
wholly
independent
of
the
police
prefects
the
minister
of
the
interior
baroche
protested
against
this
trespass
on
his
preserves
a
miserable
compromise
followed
according
to
which
the
police
commissioner
of
the
assembly
was
to
be
paid
out
of
its
own
private
budget
and
was
to
be
subject
to
the
appointment
and
dismissal
of
its
own
questors
but
only
upon
previous
agreement
with
the
minister
of
the
interior
in
the
meantime
allais
had
been
prosecuted
by
the
government
it
was
an
easy
thing
in
court
to
present
his
testimony
in
the
light
of
a
mystification
and
through
the
mouth
of
the
public
prosecutor
to
throw
dupin
changarnier
yon
together
with
the
whole
national
assembly
into
a
ridiculous
light
thereupon
on
december
minister
baroche
writes
a
letter
to
dupin
in
which
he
demands
the
dismissal
of
yon
the
committee
of
the
national
assembly
decides
to
keep
yon
in
office
nevertheless
the
national
assembly
frightened
by
its
own
violence
in
the
affair
of
mauguin
and
accustomed
every
time
it
has
shied
a
blow
at
the
executive
to
receive
back
from
it
two
in
exchange
does
not
sanction
this
decision
it
dismisses
yon
in
reward
for
his
zeal
in
office
and
robs
itself
of
a
parliamentary
prerogative
indispensable
against
a
person
who
does
not
decide
by
night
to
execute
by
day
but
decides
by
day
and
executes
by
night
we
have
seen
how
during
the
months
of
november
and
december
under
great
and
severe
provocations
the
national
assembly
evaded
and
refused
the
combat
with
the
executive
power
now
we
see
it
compelled
to
accept
it
on
the
smallest
occasions
in
the
affair
of
mauguin
it
confirms
in
principle
the
liability
of
a
representative
to
imprisonment
for
debt
but
to
itself
reserves
the
power
of
allowing
the
principle
to
be
applied
only
to
the
representatives
whom
it
dislikes
for
this
infamous
privilege
we
see
it
wrangling
with
the
minister
of
justice
instead
of
utilizing
the
alleged
murder
plan
to
the
end
of
fastening
an
inquest
upon
the
society
of
december
and
of
exposing
bonaparte
beyond
redemption
before
france
and
his
true
figure
as
the
head
of
the
of
paris
it
allows
the
collision
to
sink
to
a
point
where
the
only
issue
between
itself
and
the
minister
of
the
interior
is
who
has
jurisdiction
over
the
appointment
and
dismissal
of
a
police
commissioner
thus
we
see
the
party
of
order
during
this
whole
period
compelled
by
its
ambiguous
position
to
wear
out
and
fritter
away
its
conflict
with
the
executive
power
in
small
quarrels
about
jurisdiction
in
chicaneries
in
pettifogging
in
boundary
disputes
and
to
turn
the
stalest
questions
of
form
into
the
very
substance
of
its
activity
it
dares
not
accept
the
collision
at
the
moment
when
it
involves
a
principle
when
the
executive
power
has
really
given
itself
a
blank
and
when
the
cause
of
the
national
assembly
would
be
the
cause
of
the
nation
it
would
thereby
have
issued
to
the
nation
an
order
of
march
and
it
feared
nothing
so
much
as
that
the
nation
should
move
hence
on
these
occasions
it
rejects
the
motions
of
the
mountain
and
proceeds
to
the
order
of
the
day
after
the
issue
has
in
this
way
lost
all
magnitude
the
executive
power
quietly
awaits
the
moment
when
it
can
take
it
up
again
upon
small
and
insignificant
occasions
when
so
to
say
the
issue
offers
only
a
parliamentary
local
interest
then
does
the
repressed
valor
of
the
party
of
order
break
forth
then
it
tears
away
the
curtain
from
the
scene
then
it
denounces
the
president
then
it
declares
the
republic
to
be
in
danger
but
then
all
its
pathos
appears
stale
and
the
occasion
for
the
quarrel
a
hypocritical
pretext
or
not
at
all
worth
the
effort
the
parliamentary
tempest
becomes
a
tempest
in
a
the
struggle
an
intrigue
the
collision
a
scandal
while
the
revolutionary
classes
gloat
with
sardonic
laughter
over
the
humiliation
of
the
national
assembly
they
of
course
being
as
enthusiastic
for
the
prerogatives
of
the
parliament
as
that
body
is
for
public
freedom
the
bourgeoisie
outside
of
the
parliament
does
not
understand
how
the
bourgeoisie
inside
of
the
parliament
can
squander
its
time
with
such
petty
bickerings
and
can
endanger
peace
by
such
wretched
rivalries
with
the
president
it
is
puzzled
at
a
strategy
that
makes
peace
the
very
moment
when
everybody
expects
battles
and
that
attacks
the
very
moment
everybody
believes
peace
has
been
concluded
on
december
pascal
duprat
interpellated
the
minister
of
the
interior
on
the
goldbar
lottery
this
lottery
was
a
daughter
from
elysium
bonaparte
together
with
his
faithful
had
given
her
birth
and
police
prefect
carlier
had
placed
her
under
his
official
protection
although
the
french
law
forbade
all
lotteries
with
the
exception
of
games
for
benevolent
purposes
seven
million
tickets
a
franc
a
piece
and
the
profit
ostensibly
destined
to
the
shipping
of
parisian
vagabonds
to
california
golden
dreams
were
to
displace
the
socialist
dreams
of
the
parisian
proletariat
the
tempting
prospect
of
a
prize
was
to
displace
the
doctrinal
right
to
labor
of
course
the
workingmen
of
paris
did
not
recognize
in
the
lustre
of
the
california
gold
bars
the
francs
that
had
been
wheedled
out
of
their
pockets
in
the
main
however
the
scheme
was
an
unmitigated
swindle
the
vagabonds
who
meant
to
open
california
gold
mines
without
taking
the
pains
to
leave
paris
were
bonaparte
himself
and
his
round
table
of
desperate
insolvents
the
three
millions
granted
by
the
national
assembly
were
rioted
away
the
treasury
had
to
be
refilled
somehow
or
another
in
vain
did
bonaparte
open
a
national
subscription
at
the
head
of
which
he
himself
figured
with
a
large
sum
for
the
establishment
of
cites
ouvrieres
work
cities
the
bourgeois
waited
distrustful
for
the
payment
of
his
own
shares
and
as
this
of
course
never
took
place
the
speculation
in
socialist
castles
in
the
air
fell
flat
the
gold
bars
drew
better
bonaparte
and
his
associates
did
not
content
themselves
with
putting
into
their
own
pockets
part
of
the
surplus
of
the
seven
millions
over
and
above
the
bars
that
were
to
be
drawn
they
manufactured
false
tickets
they
sold
of
number
alone
fifteen
to
twenty
lots
a
financial
operation
fully
in
the
spirit
of
the
society
of
december
the
national
assembly
did
not
here
have
before
it
the
fictitious
president
of
the
republic
but
bonaparte
himself
in
flesh
and
blood
here
it
could
catch
him
in
the
act
not
in
conflict
with
the
constitution
but
with
the
penal
code
when
upon
interpellation
the
national
assembly
went
over
to
the
order
of
the
day
this
did
not
happen
simply
because
girardin
motion
to
declare
itself
satisfied
reminded
the
party
of
order
of
its
own
systematic
corruption
the
bourgeois
above
all
the
bourgeois
who
has
been
inflated
into
a
statesman
supplements
his
practical
meanness
with
theoretical
pompousness
as
statesman
he
becomes
like
the
government
facing
him
a
superior
being
who
can
be
fought
only
in
a
higher
more
exalted
manner
for
the
very
reason
of
his
being
a
bohemian
a
princely
had
over
the
scampish
bourgeois
the
advantage
that
he
could
carry
on
the
fight
after
the
assembly
itself
had
carried
him
with
its
own
hands
over
the
slippery
ground
of
the
military
banquets
of
the
reviews
of
the
society
of
december
and
finally
of
the
penal
saw
that
the
moment
had
arrived
when
he
could
move
from
the
seemingly
defensive
to
the
offensive
he
was
but
little
troubled
by
the
intermediate
and
trifling
defeats
of
the
minister
of
justice
of
the
minister
of
war
of
the
minister
of
the
navy
of
the
minister
of
finance
whereby
the
national
assembly
indicated
its
growling
displeasure
not
only
did
he
prevent
the
ministers
from
resigning
and
thus
recognizing
the
subordination
of
the
executive
power
to
the
parliament
he
could
now
accomplish
what
during
the
vacation
of
the
national
assembly
he
had
commenced
the
separation
of
the
military
power
from
the
assembly
the
deposition
of
changarnier
an
elysee
paper
published
an
order
issued
during
the
month
of
may
ostensibly
to
the
first
military
division
and
hence
proceeding
from
changarnier
wherein
the
officers
were
recommended
in
case
of
an
uprising
to
give
no
quarter
to
the
traitors
in
their
own
ranks
to
shoot
them
down
on
the
spot
and
to
refuse
troops
to
the
national
assembly
should
it
make
a
requisition
for
such
on
january
the
cabinet
was
interpellated
on
this
order
the
cabinet
demands
for
the
examination
of
the
affair
at
first
three
months
then
one
week
finally
only
hours
time
the
assembly
orders
an
immediate
explanation
changarnier
rises
and
declares
that
this
order
never
existed
he
adds
that
he
would
ever
hasten
to
respond
to
the
calls
of
the
national
assembly
and
that
in
case
of
a
collision
they
could
count
upon
him
the
assembly
receives
his
utterances
with
inexpressible
applause
and
decrees
a
vote
of
confidence
to
him
it
thereby
resign
its
own
powers
it
decrees
its
own
impotence
and
the
omnipotence
of
the
army
by
committing
itself
to
the
private
protection
of
a
general
but
the
general
in
turn
deceives
himself
when
he
places
at
the
disposal
and
against
bonaparte
a
power
that
he
holds
only
as
a
fief
from
that
same
bonaparte
and
when
on
his
part
he
expects
protection
from
this
parliament
from
his
protege
itself
needful
of
protection
but
changarnier
has
faith
in
the
mysterious
power
with
which
since
january
he
had
been
clad
by
the
bourgeoisie
he
takes
himself
for
the
third
power
standing
beside
the
other
powers
of
government
he
shares
the
faith
of
all
the
other
heroes
or
rather
saints
of
this
epoch
whose
greatness
consists
but
in
the
interested
good
opinion
that
their
own
party
holds
of
them
and
who
shrink
into
figures
so
soon
as
circumstances
invite
them
to
perform
miracles
infidelity
is
indeed
the
deadly
enemy
of
these
supposed
heroes
and
real
saints
hence
their
virtuously
proud
indignation
at
the
unenthusiastic
wits
and
scoffers
that
same
evening
the
ministers
were
summoned
to
the
elysee
bonaparte
presses
the
removal
of
changarnier
five
ministers
refuse
to
sign
the
order
the
moniteur
announces
a
ministerial
crisis
and
the
party
of
order
threatens
the
formation
of
a
parliamentary
army
under
the
command
of
changarnier
the
party
of
order
had
the
constitutional
power
hereto
it
needed
only
to
elect
changarnier
president
of
the
national
assembly
in
order
to
make
a
requisition
for
whatever
military
forces
it
needed
for
its
own
safety
it
could
do
this
all
the
more
safely
seeing
that
changarnier
still
stood
at
the
head
of
the
army
and
of
the
parisian
national
guard
and
only
lay
in
wait
to
be
summoned
together
with
the
army
the
bonapartist
press
did
not
even
dare
to
question
the
right
of
the
national
assembly
to
issue
a
direct
requisition
for
troops
a
legal
scruple
that
under
the
given
circumstances
did
not
promise
success
that
the
army
would
have
obeyed
the
orders
of
the
national
assembly
is
probable
when
it
is
considered
that
bonaparte
had
to
look
eight
days
all
over
paris
to
find
two
generals
baraguay
and
jean
who
declared
themselves
ready
to
countersign
the
order
cashiering
changamier
that
however
the
party
of
order
would
have
found
in
its
own
ranks
and
in
the
parliament
the
requisite
vote
for
such
a
decision
is
more
than
doubtful
when
it
is
considered
that
eight
days
later
votes
pulled
away
from
it
and
that
as
late
as
december
at
the
last
decisive
hour
the
mountain
rejected
a
similar
proposition
nevertheless
the
burgraves
might
still
have
succeeded
in
driving
the
mass
of
their
party
to
an
act
of
heroism
consisting
in
feeling
safe
behind
a
forest
of
bayonets
and
in
accepting
the
services
of
the
army
which
found
itself
deserted
in
its
camp
instead
of
this
the
messieurs
burgraves
betook
themselves
to
the
elysee
on
the
evening
of
january
with
the
view
of
inducing
bonaparte
by
means
of
politic
words
and
considerations
to
drop
the
removal
of
changarnier
him
whom
we
must
convince
we
recognize
as
the
master
of
the
situation
bonaparte
made
to
feel
secure
by
this
step
appoints
on
january
a
new
ministry
in
which
the
leaders
of
the
old
fould
and
baroche
are
retained
st
jean
becomes
minister
of
war
the
moniteur
announces
the
decree
cashiering
changarnier
his
command
is
divided
up
between
baraguay
who
receives
the
first
division
and
perrot
who
is
placed
over
the
national
guard
the
bulwark
of
society
is
turned
down
and
although
no
dog
barks
over
the
event
in
the
bourses
the
stock
quotations
rise
by
repelling
the
army
that
in
changarnier
person
put
itself
at
its
disposal
and
thus
irrevocably
stood
up
against
the
president
the
party
of
order
declares
that
the
bourgeoisie
has
lost
its
vocation
to
reign
already
there
was
no
parliamentary
ministry
by
losing
furthermore
the
handle
to
the
army
and
to
the
national
guard
what
instrument
of
force
was
there
left
to
the
national
assembly
in
order
to
maintain
both
the
usurped
power
of
the
parliament
over
the
people
and
its
constitutional
power
over
the
president
none
all
that
was
left
to
it
was
the
appeal
to
peaceful
principles
that
itself
had
always
explained
as
general
rules
merely
to
be
prescribed
to
third
parties
and
only
in
order
to
enable
itself
to
move
all
the
more
freely
with
the
removal
of
changarnier
with
the
transfer
of
the
military
power
to
bonaparte
closes
the
first
part
of
the
period
that
we
are
considering
the
period
of
the
struggle
between
the
party
of
order
and
the
executive
power
the
war
between
the
two
powers
is
now
openly
declared
it
is
conducted
openly
but
only
after
the
party
of
order
has
lost
both
arms
and
soldier
a
ministry
without
any
army
without
a
people
without
the
support
of
public
opinion
since
its
election
law
of
may
no
longer
the
representative
of
the
sovereign
nation
sans
eyes
sans
ears
sans
teeth
sans
everything
the
national
assembly
had
gradually
converted
itself
into
a
french
parliament
of
olden
days
that
must
leave
all
action
to
the
government
and
content
itself
with
growling
remonstrances
post
festum
after
the
act
is
done
after
the
fact
the
party
of
order
receives
the
new
ministry
with
a
storm
of
indignation
general
bedeau
calls
to
mind
the
mildness
of
the
permanent
committee
during
the
vacation
and
the
excessive
prudence
with
which
it
had
renounced
the
privilege
of
disclosing
its
minutes
now
the
minister
of
the
interior
himself
insists
upon
the
disclosure
of
these
minutes
that
have
now
of
course
become
dull
as
stagnant
waters
reveal
no
new
facts
and
fall
without
making
the
slightest
effect
upon
the
blase
public
upon
remusat
proposition
the
national
assembly
retreats
into
its
committees
and
appoints
a
committee
on
extraordinary
measures
paris
steps
all
the
less
out
of
the
ruts
of
its
daily
routine
seeing
that
business
is
prosperous
at
the
time
the
manufactories
busy
the
prices
of
cereals
low
provisions
abundant
the
savings
banks
receiving
daily
new
deposits
the
extraordinary
measures
that
the
parliament
so
noisily
announced
fizzle
out
on
january
in
a
vote
of
lack
of
confidence
against
the
ministry
without
general
changarnier
name
being
even
mentioned
the
party
of
order
was
forced
to
frame
its
motion
in
that
way
so
as
to
secure
the
votes
of
the
republicans
because
of
all
the
acts
of
the
ministry
changarnier
dismissal
only
was
the
very
one
they
approved
while
the
party
of
order
can
not
in
fact
condemn
the
other
ministerial
acts
which
it
had
itself
dictated
the
january
vote
of
lack
of
confidence
was
decided
by
ayes
against
nays
it
was
accordingly
put
through
by
a
coalition
of
the
uncompromising
legitimists
and
orleanists
with
the
pure
republicans
and
the
mountain
thus
it
revealed
the
fact
that
in
its
conflicts
with
bonaparte
not
only
the
ministry
not
only
the
army
but
also
its
independent
parliamentary
majority
that
a
troop
of
representatives
had
deserted
its
camp
out
of
a
fanatic
zeal
for
harmony
out
of
fear
of
fight
out
of
lassitude
out
of
family
considerations
for
the
salaries
of
relatives
in
office
out
of
speculations
on
vacancies
in
the
ministry
odillon
barrot
or
out
of
that
unmitigated
selfishness
that
causes
the
average
bourgeois
to
be
ever
inclined
to
sacrifice
the
interests
of
his
class
to
this
or
that
private
motive
the
bonapartist
representatives
belonged
from
the
start
to
the
party
of
order
only
in
the
struggle
against
the
revolution
the
leader
of
the
catholic
party
montalembert
already
then
threw
his
influence
in
the
scale
of
bonaparte
since
he
despaired
of
the
vitality
of
the
parliamentary
party
finally
the
leaders
of
this
party
itself
thiers
and
berryer
the
orleanist
and
the
legitimist
were
compelled
to
proclaim
themselves
openly
as
republicans
to
admit
that
their
heart
favored
royalty
but
their
head
the
republic
that
their
parliamentary
republic
was
the
only
possible
form
for
the
rule
of
the
bourgeoisie
thus
were
they
compelled
to
brand
before
the
eyes
of
the
bourgeois
class
itself
as
an
intrigue
as
dangerous
as
it
was
senseless
the
restoration
plans
which
they
continued
to
pursue
indefatigably
behind
the
back
of
the
parliament
the
january
vote
of
lack
of
confidence
struck
the
ministers
not
the
president
but
it
was
not
the
ministry
it
was
the
president
who
had
deposed
changarnier
should
the
party
of
order
place
bonaparte
himself
under
charges
on
account
of
his
restoration
hankerings
these
only
supplemented
their
own
on
account
of
his
conspiracy
at
the
military
reviews
and
of
the
society
of
december
they
had
long
since
buried
these
subjects
under
simple
orders
of
business
on
account
of
the
discharge
of
the
hero
of
january
and
june
of
the
man
who
in
may
threatened
in
case
of
riot
to
set
paris
on
fire
at
all
its
four
corners
their
allies
of
the
mountain
and
cavaignac
did
not
even
allow
them
to
console
the
fallen
bulwark
of
society
with
an
official
testimony
of
their
sympathy
they
themselves
could
not
deny
the
constitutional
right
of
the
president
to
remove
a
general
they
stormed
only
because
he
made
an
unparliamentary
use
of
his
constitutional
right
had
they
not
themselves
constantly
made
an
unconstitutional
use
of
their
parliamentary
prerogative
notably
by
the
abolition
of
universal
suffrage
consequently
they
were
reminded
to
move
exclusively
within
parliamentary
bounds
indeed
it
required
that
peculiar
disease
a
disease
that
since
has
raged
over
the
whole
continent
parliamentary
idiocy
that
fetters
those
whom
it
infects
to
an
imaginary
world
and
robs
them
of
all
sense
all
remembrance
all
understanding
of
the
rude
outside
world
it
required
this
parliamentary
idiocy
in
order
that
the
party
of
order
which
had
with
its
own
hands
destroyed
all
the
conditions
for
parliamentary
power
and
in
its
struggle
with
the
other
classes
was
obliged
to
destroy
them
still
should
consider
its
parliamentary
victories
as
victories
and
imagine
it
hit
the
president
by
striking
his
ministers
they
only
afforded
him
an
opportunity
to
humble
the
national
assembly
anew
in
the
eyes
of
the
nation
on
january
the
moniteur
announced
that
the
whole
the
dismissal
of
the
whole
ministry
was
accepted
under
the
pretext
that
none
of
the
parliamentary
parties
had
any
longer
the
majority
as
proved
by
the
january
vote
that
fruit
of
the
coalition
between
mountain
and
royalists
and
in
order
to
await
the
of
a
majority
bonaparte
appointed
a
transition
ministry
of
whom
no
member
belonged
to
the
wholly
unknown
and
insignificant
individuals
a
ministry
of
mere
clerks
and
secretaries
the
party
of
order
could
now
wear
itself
out
in
the
game
with
these
puppets
the
executive
power
no
longer
considered
it
worth
the
while
to
be
seriously
represented
in
the
national
assembly
by
this
act
bonaparte
concentrated
the
whole
executive
power
all
the
more
securely
in
his
own
person
he
had
all
the
freer
to
exploit
the
same
to
his
own
ends
the
more
his
ministers
became
mere
supernumeraries
the
party
of
order
now
allied
with
the
mountain
revenged
itself
by
rejecting
the
presidential
endowment
project
of
francs
which
the
chief
of
the
society
of
december
had
compelled
his
ministerial
clerks
to
present
to
the
assembly
this
time
a
majority
of
only
votes
carried
the
day
accordingly
since
january
more
votes
had
fallen
off
the
dissolution
of
the
party
of
order
was
making
progress
lest
any
one
might
for
a
moment
be
deceived
touching
the
meaning
of
its
coalition
with
the
mountain
the
party
of
order
simultaneously
scorned
even
to
consider
a
motion
signed
by
members
of
the
mountain
for
a
general
amnesty
to
political
criminals
it
was
enough
that
the
minister
of
the
interior
one
baisse
declared
that
the
national
tranquility
was
only
in
appearance
in
secret
there
reigned
deep
agitation
in
secret
ubiquitous
societies
were
organized
the
democratic
papers
were
preparing
to
reappear
the
reports
from
the
departments
were
unfavorable
the
fugitives
of
geneva
conducted
a
conspiracy
via
lyons
through
the
whole
of
southern
france
france
stood
on
the
verge
of
an
industrial
and
commercial
crisis
the
manufacturers
of
roubaix
were
working
shorter
hours
the
prisoners
of
belle
isle
had
mutinied
it
was
enough
that
even
a
mere
baisse
should
conjure
up
the
red
spectre
for
the
party
of
order
to
reject
without
discussion
a
motion
that
would
have
gained
for
the
national
assembly
a
tremendous
popularity
and
thrown
bonaparte
back
into
its
arms
instead
of
allowing
itself
to
be
intimidated
by
the
executive
power
with
the
perspective
of
fresh
disturbances
the
party
of
order
should
rather
have
allowed
a
little
to
the
class
struggle
in
order
to
secure
the
dependence
of
the
executive
upon
itself
but
it
did
not
feel
itself
equal
to
the
task
of
playing
with
fire
meanwhile
the
transition
ministry
vegetated
along
until
the
middle
of
april
bonaparte
tired
out
and
fooled
the
national
assembly
with
constantly
new
ministerial
combinations
now
he
seemed
to
intend
constructing
a
republican
ministry
with
lamartine
and
billault
then
a
parliamentary
one
with
the
inevitable
odillon
barrot
whose
name
must
never
be
absent
when
a
dupe
is
needed
then
again
a
legitimist
with
batismenil
and
lenoist
and
yet
again
an
orleansist
with
malleville
while
thus
throwing
the
several
factions
of
the
party
of
order
into
strained
relations
with
one
another
and
alarming
them
all
with
the
prospect
of
a
republican
ministry
together
with
the
inevitable
restoration
of
universal
suffrage
bonaparte
simultaneously
raises
in
the
bourgeoisie
the
conviction
that
his
sincere
efforts
for
a
parliamentary
ministry
are
wrecked
upon
the
irreconcilable
antagonism
of
the
royalist
factions
all
the
while
the
bourgeoisie
was
clamoring
louder
and
louder
for
a
strong
government
and
was
finding
it
less
and
less
pardonable
to
leave
france
without
an
administration
in
proportion
as
a
general
commercial
crisis
seemed
to
be
under
way
and
making
recruits
for
socialism
in
the
cities
as
did
the
ruinously
low
price
of
grain
in
the
rural
districts
trade
became
daily
duller
the
unemployed
hands
increased
perceptibly
in
paris
at
least
workingmen
were
without
bread
in
rouen
muehlhausen
lyons
roubaix
tourcoign
etienue
elbeuf
numerous
factories
stood
idle
under
these
circumstances
bonaparte
could
venture
to
restore
on
april
the
ministry
of
january
messieurs
rouher
fould
baroche
reinforced
by
leon
faucher
whom
the
constitutive
assembly
had
during
its
last
days
unanimously
with
the
exception
of
five
ministerial
votes
branded
with
a
vote
of
censure
for
circulating
false
telegraphic
dispatches
accordingly
the
national
assembly
had
won
a
victory
on
january
over
the
ministry
it
had
for
the
period
of
three
months
been
battling
with
bonaparte
and
all
this
merely
to
the
end
that
on
april
fould
and
baroche
should
be
able
to
take
up
the
puritan
faucher
as
third
in
their
ministerial
league
in
november
bonaparte
had
satisfied
himself
with
an
unparliamentary
in
january
with
an
on
april
he
felt
strong
enough
to
form
an
ministry
that
harmoniously
combined
within
itself
the
votes
of
lack
of
confidence
of
both
constitutive
and
the
legislative
the
republican
and
the
royalist
this
ministerial
progression
was
a
thermometer
by
which
the
parliament
could
measure
the
ebbing
temperature
of
its
own
life
this
had
sunk
so
low
by
the
end
of
april
that
at
a
personal
interview
persigny
could
invite
changarnier
to
go
over
to
the
camp
of
the
president
bonaparte
he
assured
changarnier
considered
the
influence
of
the
national
assembly
to
be
wholly
annihilated
and
already
the
proclamation
was
ready
that
was
to
be
published
after
the
steadily
contemplated
but
again
accidentally
postponed
coup
changarnier
communicated
this
announcement
of
its
death
to
the
leaders
of
the
party
of
order
but
who
was
there
to
believe
a
bite
could
kill
the
parliament
however
beaten
however
dissolved
however
it
was
could
not
persuade
itself
to
see
in
the
duel
with
the
grotesque
chief
of
the
society
of
december
anything
but
a
duel
with
a
but
bonaparte
answered
the
party
of
order
as
agesilaus
did
king
agis
i
seem
to
you
an
ant
but
shall
one
day
be
a
lion
vi
the
coalition
with
the
mountain
and
the
pure
republicans
to
which
the
party
of
order
found
itself
condemned
in
its
fruitless
efforts
to
keep
possession
of
the
military
and
to
reconquer
supreme
control
over
the
executive
power
proved
conclusively
that
it
had
forfeited
its
independent
parliamentary
majority
the
calendar
and
clock
merely
gave
on
may
the
signal
for
its
complete
dissolution
with
may
commenced
the
last
year
of
the
life
of
the
national
assembly
it
now
had
to
decide
for
the
unchanged
continuance
or
the
revision
of
the
constitution
but
a
revision
of
the
constitution
meant
not
only
the
definitive
supremacy
of
either
the
bourgeoisie
of
the
small
democracy
of
either
democracy
or
proletarian
anarchy
of
either
a
parliamentary
republic
or
bonaparte
it
meant
also
either
orleans
or
bourbon
thus
fell
into
the
very
midst
of
the
parliament
the
apple
of
discord
around
which
the
conflict
of
interests
that
cut
up
the
party
of
order
into
hostile
factions
was
to
kindle
into
an
open
conflagration
the
party
of
order
was
a
combination
of
heterogeneous
social
substances
the
question
of
revision
raised
a
political
temperature
in
which
the
product
was
reduced
to
its
original
components
the
interest
of
the
bonapartists
in
the
revision
was
simple
they
were
above
all
concerned
in
the
abolition
of
article
which
forbade
bonaparte
reelection
and
the
prolongation
of
his
term
not
less
simple
seemed
to
be
the
position
of
the
republicans
they
rejected
all
revision
seeing
in
that
only
a
general
conspiracy
against
the
republic
as
they
disposed
over
more
than
of
the
votes
in
the
national
assembly
and
according
to
the
constitution
a
majority
was
requisite
to
revise
and
to
call
a
revisory
convention
they
needed
only
to
count
their
own
votes
to
be
certain
of
victory
indeed
they
were
certain
of
it
over
and
against
these
positions
the
party
of
order
found
itself
tangled
in
inextricable
contradictions
if
it
voted
against
the
revision
it
endangered
the
status
quo
by
leaving
to
bonaparte
only
one
expedient
that
of
violence
and
handing
france
over
on
may
at
the
very
time
of
election
a
prey
to
revolutionary
anarchy
with
a
president
whose
authority
was
at
an
end
with
a
parliament
that
the
party
had
long
ceased
to
own
and
with
a
people
that
it
meant
to
if
it
voted
constitutionally
for
a
revision
it
knew
that
it
voted
in
vain
and
would
constitutionally
have
to
go
under
before
the
veto
of
the
republicans
if
unconstitutionally
it
pronounced
a
simple
majority
binding
it
could
hope
to
control
the
revolution
only
in
case
it
surrendered
unconditionally
to
the
domination
of
the
executive
power
it
then
made
bonaparte
master
of
the
constitution
of
the
revision
and
of
itself
a
merely
partial
revision
prolonging
the
term
of
the
president
opened
the
way
to
imperial
usurpation
a
general
revision
shortening
the
existence
of
the
republic
threw
the
dynastic
claims
into
an
inevitable
conflict
the
conditions
for
a
bourbon
and
those
for
an
orleanist
restoration
were
not
only
different
they
mutually
excluded
each
other
the
parliamentary
republic
was
more
than
a
neutral
ground
on
which
the
two
factions
of
the
french
bourgeoisie
legitimists
and
orleanists
large
landed
property
and
manufacture
could
lodge
together
with
equal
rights
it
was
the
indispensable
condition
for
their
common
reign
the
only
form
of
government
in
which
their
common
class
interest
could
dominate
both
the
claims
of
their
separate
factions
and
all
the
other
classes
of
society
as
royalists
they
relapsed
into
their
old
antagonism
into
the
struggle
for
the
overlordship
of
either
landed
property
or
of
money
and
the
highest
expression
of
this
antagonism
its
personification
were
the
two
kings
themselves
their
dynasties
hence
the
resistance
of
the
party
of
order
to
the
recall
of
the
bourbons
the
orleanist
representative
creton
moved
periodically
in
and
the
repeal
of
the
decree
of
banishment
against
the
royal
families
as
periodically
did
the
parliament
present
the
spectacle
of
an
assembly
of
royalists
who
stubbornly
shut
to
their
banished
kings
the
door
through
which
they
could
return
home
richard
iii
murdered
henry
vi
with
the
remark
that
he
was
too
good
for
this
world
and
belonged
in
heaven
they
declared
france
too
bad
to
have
her
kings
back
again
forced
by
the
power
of
circumstances
they
had
become
republicans
and
repeatedly
sanctioned
the
popular
mandate
that
exiled
their
kings
from
france
the
revision
of
the
constitution
and
circumstances
compelled
its
consideration
at
once
made
uncertain
not
only
the
republic
itself
but
also
the
joint
reign
of
the
two
bourgeois
factions
and
it
revived
with
the
possibility
of
the
monarchy
both
the
rivalry
of
interests
which
these
two
factions
had
alternately
allowed
to
preponderate
and
the
struggle
for
the
supremacy
of
the
one
over
the
other
the
diplomats
of
the
party
of
order
believed
they
could
allay
the
struggle
by
a
combination
of
the
two
dynasties
through
a
fusion
of
the
royalist
parties
and
their
respective
royal
houses
the
true
fusion
of
the
restoration
and
the
july
monarchy
was
however
the
parliamentary
republic
in
which
the
orleanist
and
legitimist
colors
were
dissolved
and
the
bourgeois
species
vanished
in
the
plain
bourgeois
in
the
bourgeois
genus
now
however
the
plan
was
to
turn
the
orleanist
legitimist
and
the
legitimist
orleanist
the
kingship
in
which
their
antagonism
was
personified
was
to
incarnate
their
unity
the
expression
of
their
exclusive
faction
interests
was
to
become
the
expression
of
their
common
class
interest
the
monarchy
was
to
accomplish
what
only
the
abolition
of
two
monarchies
the
republic
could
and
did
accomplish
this
was
the
philosopher
stone
for
the
finding
of
which
the
doctors
of
the
party
of
order
were
breaking
their
heads
as
though
the
legitimate
monarchy
ever
could
be
the
monarchy
of
the
industrial
bourgeoisie
or
the
bourgeois
monarchy
the
monarchy
of
the
hereditary
landed
aristocracy
as
though
landed
property
and
industry
could
fraternize
under
one
crown
where
the
crown
could
fall
only
upon
one
head
the
head
of
the
older
or
the
younger
brother
as
though
industry
could
at
all
deal
upon
a
footing
of
equality
with
landed
property
so
long
as
landed
property
did
not
decide
itself
to
become
industrial
if
henry
v
were
to
die
tomorrow
the
count
of
paris
would
not
therefore
become
the
king
of
the
legitimists
unless
he
ceased
to
be
the
king
of
the
orleanists
nevertheless
the
fusion
philosophers
who
became
louder
in
the
measure
that
the
question
of
revision
stepped
to
the
fore
who
had
provided
themselves
with
a
daily
organ
in
the
assemblee
nationale
who
even
at
this
very
moment
february
are
again
at
work
explained
the
whole
difficulty
by
the
opposition
and
rivalries
of
the
two
dynasties
the
attempts
to
reconcile
the
family
of
orleans
with
henry
begun
since
the
death
of
louis
philippe
but
as
all
these
dynastic
intrigues
carried
on
only
during
the
vacation
of
the
national
assembly
between
acts
behind
the
scenes
more
as
a
sentimental
coquetry
with
the
old
superstition
than
as
a
serious
affair
were
now
raised
by
the
party
of
order
to
the
dignity
of
a
great
state
question
and
were
conducted
upon
the
public
stage
instead
of
as
heretofore
in
the
amateurs
theater
couriers
flew
from
paris
to
venice
from
venice
to
claremont
from
claremont
to
paris
the
duke
of
chambord
issues
a
manifesto
in
which
he
announces
not
his
own
but
the
national
restoration
with
the
aid
of
all
the
members
of
his
family
the
oleanist
salvandy
throws
himself
at
the
feet
of
henry
the
legitimist
leaders
berryer
benoit
st
priest
travel
to
claremont
to
persuade
the
orleans
but
in
vain
the
fusionists
learn
too
late
that
the
interests
of
the
two
bourgeois
factions
neither
lose
in
exclusiveness
nor
gain
in
pliancy
where
they
sharpen
to
a
point
in
the
form
of
family
interests
of
the
interests
of
the
two
royal
houses
when
henry
recognized
the
count
of
paris
as
his
successor
the
only
success
that
the
fusion
could
at
best
score
the
house
of
orleans
acquired
no
claim
that
the
childlessness
of
henry
had
not
already
secured
to
it
but
on
the
other
hand
it
lost
all
the
claims
that
it
had
conquered
by
the
july
revolution
it
renounced
its
original
claims
all
the
title
that
during
a
struggle
nearly
one
hundred
years
long
it
had
wrested
from
the
older
branch
of
the
bourbons
it
bartered
away
its
historic
prerogative
the
prerogative
of
its
fusion
accordingly
amounted
to
nothing
else
than
the
resignation
of
the
house
of
orleans
its
legitimist
resignation
a
repentful
return
from
the
protestant
state
church
into
the
catholic
a
return
at
that
that
did
not
even
place
it
on
the
throne
that
it
had
lost
but
on
the
steps
of
the
throne
on
which
it
was
born
the
old
orleanist
ministers
guizot
duchatel
who
likewise
hastened
to
claremont
to
advocate
the
fusion
represented
in
fact
only
the
nervous
reaction
of
the
july
monarchy
despair
both
in
the
citizen
kingdom
and
the
kingdom
of
citizens
the
superstitious
belief
in
legitimacy
as
the
last
amulet
against
anarchy
mediators
in
their
imagination
between
orleans
and
bourbon
they
were
in
reality
but
apostate
orleanists
and
as
such
were
they
received
by
the
prince
of
joinville
the
virile
bellicose
part
of
the
orleanists
on
the
contrary
thiers
baze
persuaded
the
family
of
louis
philippe
all
the
easier
that
seeing
every
plan
for
the
immediate
restoration
of
the
monarchy
presupposed
the
fusion
of
the
two
dynasties
and
every
plan
for
fusion
the
resignation
of
the
house
of
orleans
it
corresponded
on
the
contrary
wholly
with
the
tradition
of
its
ancestors
to
recognize
the
republic
for
the
time
being
and
to
wait
until
circumstances
permitted
i
the
conversion
of
the
presidential
chair
into
a
throne
joinville
candidacy
was
set
afloat
as
a
rumor
public
curiosity
was
held
in
suspense
and
a
few
months
later
after
the
revision
was
rejected
openly
proclaimed
in
september
accordingly
the
essay
of
a
royalist
fusion
between
orleanists
and
legitimists
did
not
miscarry
only
it
broke
up
their
parliamentary
fusion
the
republican
form
that
they
had
adopted
in
common
and
it
decomposed
the
party
of
order
into
its
original
components
but
the
wider
the
breach
became
between
venice
and
claremont
the
further
they
drifted
away
from
each
i
other
and
the
greater
the
progress
made
by
the
joinville
agitation
all
the
more
active
and
earnest
became
the
negotiations
between
faucher
the
minister
of
bonaparte
and
the
legitimists
the
dissolution
of
the
party
of
order
went
beyond
its
original
elements
each
of
the
two
large
factions
fell
in
turn
into
new
fragments
it
was
as
if
all
the
old
political
shades
that
formerly
fought
and
crowded
one
another
within
each
of
the
two
circles
be
it
that
of
the
legitimists
or
that
of
the
orleanists
had
been
thawed
out
like
dried
infusoria
by
contact
with
water
as
if
they
had
recovered
enough
vitality
to
build
their
own
groups
and
assert
their
own
antagonisms
the
legitimists
dreamed
they
were
back
amidst
the
quarrels
between
the
tuileries
and
the
pavilion
marsan
between
villele
and
polignac
the
orleanists
lived
anew
through
the
golden
period
of
the
tourneys
between
guizot
mole
broglie
thiers
and
odillon
barrot
that
portion
of
the
party
of
order
eager
for
a
revision
of
the
constitution
but
disagreed
upon
the
extent
of
revision
made
up
of
the
legitimists
under
berryer
and
falloux
and
of
those
under
laroche
jacquelein
together
with
the
orleanists
under
mole
broglie
montalembert
and
odillon
barrot
united
with
the
bonapartist
representatives
in
the
following
indefinite
and
loosely
drawn
motion
the
undersigned
representatives
with
the
end
in
view
of
restoring
to
the
nation
the
full
exercise
of
her
sovereignty
move
that
the
constitution
be
revised
at
the
same
time
however
they
unanimously
declared
through
their
spokesman
tocqueville
that
the
national
assembly
had
not
the
right
to
move
the
abolition
of
the
republic
that
right
being
vested
only
in
a
constitutional
convention
for
the
rest
the
constitution
could
be
revised
only
in
a
legal
way
that
is
to
say
only
in
case
a
majority
decided
in
favor
of
revision
as
prescribed
by
the
constitution
after
a
six
days
stormy
debate
the
revision
was
rejected
on
july
as
was
to
be
foreseen
in
its
favor
votes
were
cast
against
it
the
resolute
oleanists
thiers
changarnier
voted
with
the
republicans
and
the
mountain
thus
the
majority
of
the
parliament
pronounced
itself
against
the
constitution
while
the
constitution
itself
pronounced
itself
for
the
minority
and
its
decision
binding
but
had
not
the
party
of
order
on
may
had
it
not
on
june
subordinated
the
constitution
to
the
parliamentary
majority
did
not
the
whole
republic
they
had
been
hitherto
having
rest
upon
the
subordination
of
the
constitutional
clauses
to
the
majority
decisions
of
the
parliament
had
they
not
left
to
the
democrats
the
old
testament
superstitious
belief
in
the
letter
of
the
law
and
had
they
not
chastised
the
democrats
therefor
at
this
moment
however
revision
meant
nothing
else
than
the
continuance
of
the
presidential
power
as
the
continuance
of
the
constitution
meant
nothing
else
than
the
deposition
of
bonaparte
the
parliament
had
pronounced
itself
for
him
but
the
constitution
pronounced
itself
against
the
parliament
accordingly
he
acted
both
in
the
sense
of
the
parliament
when
he
tore
up
the
constitution
and
in
the
sense
of
the
constitution
when
he
chased
away
the
parliament
the
parliament
pronounced
the
constitution
and
thereby
also
its
own
reign
outside
of
the
pale
of
the
majority
by
its
decision
it
repealed
the
constitution
and
continued
the
presidential
power
and
it
at
once
declared
that
neither
could
the
one
live
nor
the
other
die
so
long
as
itself
existed
the
feet
of
those
who
were
to
bury
it
stood
at
the
door
while
it
was
debating
the
subject
of
revision
bonaparte
removed
general
baraguay
who
showed
himself
irresolute
from
the
command
of
the
first
military
division
and
appointed
in
his
place
general
magnan
the
conqueror
of
lyon
the
hero
of
the
december
days
one
of
his
own
creatures
who
already
under
louis
philippe
on
the
occasion
of
the
boulogne
expedition
had
somewhat
compromised
himself
in
his
favor
by
its
decision
on
the
revision
the
party
of
order
proved
that
it
knew
neither
how
to
rule
nor
how
to
obey
neither
how
to
live
nor
how
to
die
neither
how
to
bear
with
the
republic
nor
how
to
overthrow
it
neither
how
to
maintain
the
constitution
nor
how
to
throw
it
overboard
neither
how
to
with
the
president
nor
how
to
break
with
him
from
what
quarter
did
it
then
look
to
for
the
solution
of
all
the
existing
perplexities
from
the
calendar
from
the
course
of
events
it
ceased
to
assume
the
control
of
events
it
accordingly
invited
events
to
don
its
authority
and
also
the
power
to
which
in
its
struggle
with
the
people
it
had
yielded
one
attribute
after
another
until
it
finally
stood
powerless
before
the
same
to
the
end
that
the
executive
be
able
all
the
more
freely
to
formulate
his
plan
of
campaign
against
it
strengthen
his
means
of
attack
choose
his
tools
fortify
his
positions
the
party
of
order
decided
in
the
very
midst
of
this
critical
moment
to
step
off
the
stage
and
adjourn
for
three
months
from
august
to
november
not
only
was
the
parliamentary
party
dissolved
into
its
two
great
factions
not
only
was
each
of
these
dissolved
within
itself
but
the
party
of
order
inside
of
the
parliament
was
at
odds
with
the
party
of
order
outside
of
the
parliament
the
learned
speakers
and
writers
of
the
bourgeoisie
their
tribunes
and
their
press
in
short
the
ideologists
of
the
bourgeoisie
and
the
bourgeoisie
itself
the
representatives
and
the
represented
stood
estranged
from
and
no
longer
understood
one
another
the
legitimists
in
the
provinces
with
their
cramped
horizon
and
their
boundless
enthusiasm
charged
their
parliamentary
leaders
berryer
and
falloux
with
desertion
to
the
bonapartist
camp
and
with
apostacy
from
henry
their
lilymind
an
allusion
to
the
lilies
of
the
bourbon
believed
in
the
fall
of
man
but
not
in
diplomacy
more
fatal
and
completer
though
different
was
the
breach
between
the
commercial
bourgeoisie
and
its
politicians
it
twitted
them
not
as
the
legitimists
did
theirs
with
having
apostatized
from
their
principle
but
on
the
contrary
with
adhering
to
principles
that
had
become
useless
i
have
already
indicated
that
since
the
entry
of
fould
in
the
ministry
that
portion
of
the
commercial
bourgeoisie
that
had
enjoyed
the
share
in
louis
philippe
reign
the
aristocracy
of
finance
had
become
bonapartist
fould
not
only
represented
bonaparte
interests
at
the
bourse
he
represented
also
the
interests
of
the
bourse
with
bonaparte
a
passage
from
the
london
economist
the
european
organ
of
the
aristocracy
of
finance
described
most
strikingly
the
attitude
of
this
class
in
its
issue
of
february
its
paris
correspondent
writes
now
we
have
it
stated
from
numerous
quarters
that
france
wishes
above
all
things
for
repose
the
president
declares
it
in
his
message
to
the
legislative
assembly
it
is
echoed
from
the
tribune
it
is
asserted
in
the
journals
it
is
announced
from
the
pulpit
it
is
demonstrated
by
the
sensitiveness
of
the
public
funds
at
the
least
prospect
of
disturbance
and
their
firmness
the
instant
it
is
made
manifest
that
the
executive
is
far
superior
in
wisdom
and
power
to
the
factious
of
all
former
governments
in
its
issue
of
november
the
economist
declares
editorially
the
president
is
now
recognized
as
the
guardian
of
order
on
every
stock
exchange
of
europe
accordingly
the
aristocracy
of
finance
condemned
the
parliamentary
strife
of
the
party
of
order
with
the
executive
as
a
disturbance
of
order
and
hailed
every
victory
of
the
president
over
its
reputed
representatives
as
a
victory
of
order
under
aristocracy
of
finance
must
not
however
be
understood
merely
the
large
bond
negotiators
and
speculators
in
government
securities
of
whom
it
may
be
readily
understood
that
their
interests
and
the
interests
of
the
government
coincide
the
whole
modern
money
trade
the
whole
banking
industry
is
most
intimately
interwoven
with
the
public
credit
part
of
their
business
capital
requires
to
be
invested
in
government
securities
that
are
promptly
convertible
into
money
their
deposits
the
capital
placed
at
their
disposal
and
by
them
distributed
among
merchants
and
industrial
establishments
flow
partly
out
of
the
dividends
on
government
securities
the
whole
money
market
together
with
the
priests
of
this
market
is
part
and
parcel
of
this
aristocracy
of
finance
at
every
epoch
when
the
stability
of
the
government
is
to
them
synonymous
with
moses
and
his
prophets
this
is
so
even
before
things
have
reached
the
present
stage
when
every
deluge
threatens
to
carry
away
the
old
governments
themselves
but
the
industrial
bourgeoisie
also
in
its
fanaticism

after
their
vote
of
january
on
the
occasion
of
the
discharge
of
changarnier
public
reprimands
from
their
constituencies
located
in
the
industrial
districts
branding
their
coalition
with
the
mountain
as
an
act
of
high
treason
to
the
cause
of
order
although
true
enough
the
boastful
vexatious
and
petty
intrigues
through
which
the
struggle
of
the
party
of
order
with
the
president
manifested
itself
deserved
no
better
reception
yet
notwithstanding
this
bourgeois
party
that
expects
of
its
representatives
to
allow
the
military
power
to
pass
without
resistance
out
of
the
hands
of
their
own
parliament
into
those
of
an
adventurous
pretender
is
not
worth
even
the
intrigues
that
were
wasted
in
its
behalf
it
showed
that
the
struggle
for
the
maintenance
of
their
public
interests
of
their
class
interests
of
their
political
power
only
incommoded
and
displeased
them
as
a
disturbance
of
their
private
business
the
bourgeois
dignitaries
of
the
provincial
towns
the
magistrates
commercial
judges
with
hardly
any
exception
received
bonaparte
everywhere
on
his
excursions
in
the
most
servile
manner
even
when
as
in
dijon
he
attacked
the
national
assembly
and
especially
the
party
of
order
without
reserve
business
being
brisk
as
still
at
the
beginning
of
the
commercial
bourgeoisie
stormed
against
every
parliamentary
strife
lest
business
be
put
out
of
temper
business
being
dull
as
from
the
end
of
february
on
the
bourgeoisie
accused
the
parliamentary
strifes
as
the
cause
of
the
and
clamored
for
quiet
in
order
that
business
may
revive
the
debates
on
revision
fell
just
in
the
bad
times
seeing
the
question
now
was
the
to
be
or
not
to
be
of
the
existing
form
of
government
the
bourgeoisie
felt
itself
all
the
more
justified
in
demanding
of
its
representatives
that
they
put
an
end
to
this
tormenting
provisional
status
and
preserve
the
status
quo
this
was
no
contradiction
by
putting
an
end
to
the
provisional
status
it
understood
its
continuance
the
indefinite
putting
off
of
the
moment
when
a
final
decision
had
to
be
arrived
at
the
status
quo
could
be
preserved
in
only
one
of
two
ways
either
by
the
prolongation
of
bonaparte
term
of
office
or
by
his
constitutional
withdrawal
and
the
election
of
cavaignac
a
part
of
the
bourgeoisie
preferred
the
latter
solution
and
knew
no
better
advice
to
give
their
representatives
than
to
be
silent
to
avoid
the
burning
point
if
their
representatives
did
not
speak
so
argued
they
bonaparte
would
not
act
they
desired
an
ostrich
parliament
that
would
hide
its
head
in
order
not
to
be
seen
another
part
of
the
bourgeoisie
preferred
that
bonaparte
being
once
in
the
presidential
chair
be
left
in
the
presidential
chair
in
order
that
everything
might
continue
to
run
in
the
old
ruts
they
felt
indignant
that
their
parliament
did
not
openly
break
the
constitution
and
resign
without
further
ado
the
general
councils
of
the
departments
these
provisional
representative
bodies
of
the
large
bourgeoisie
who
had
adjourned
during
the
vacation
of
the
national
assembly
since
august
pronounced
almost
unanimously
for
revision
that
is
to
say
against
the
parliament
and
for
bonaparte
still
more
unequivocally
than
in
its
falling
out
with
its
parliamentary
representatives
did
the
bourgeoisie
exhibit
its
wrath
at
its
literary
representatives
its
own
press
the
verdicts
of
the
bourgeois
juries
inflicting
excessive
fines
and
shameless
sentences
of
imprisonment
for
every
attack
of
the
bourgeois
press
upon
the
usurping
aspirations
of
bonaparte
for
every
attempt
of
the
press
to
defend
the
political
rights
of
the
bourgeoisie
against
the
executive
power
threw
not
france
alone
but
all
europe
into
amazement
while
on
the
one
hand
as
i
have
indicated
the
parliamentary
party
of
order
ordered
itself
to
keep
the
peace
by
screaming
for
peace
and
while
it
pronounced
the
political
rule
of
the
bourgeoisie
irreconcilable
with
the
safety
and
the
existence
of
the
bourgeoisie
by
destroying
with
its
own
hands
in
its
struggle
with
the
other
classes
of
society
all
the
conditions
for
its
own
the
parliamentary
regime
on
the
other
hand
the
mass
of
the
bourgeoisie
outside
of
the
parliament
urged
bonaparte
by
its
servility
towards
the
president
by
its
insults
to
the
parliament
by
the
brutal
treatment
of
its
own
press
to
suppress
and
annihilate
its
speaking
and
writing
organs
its
politicians
and
its
literati
its
orators
tribune
and
its
press
to
the
end
that
under
the
protection
of
a
strong
and
unhampered
government
it
might
ply
its
own
private
pursuits
in
safety
it
declared
unmistakably
that
it
longed
to
be
rid
of
its
own
political
rule
in
order
to
escape
the
troubles
and
dangers
of
ruling
and
this
bourgeoisie
that
had
rebelled
against
even
the
parliamentary
and
literary
contest
for
the
supremacy
of
its
own
class
that
had
betrayed
its
leaders
in
this
contest
it
now
has
the
effrontery
to
blame
the
proletariat
for
not
having
risen
in
its
defence
in
a
bloody
struggle
in
a
struggle
for
life
those
bourgeois
who
at
every
turn
sacrificed
their
common
class
interests
to
narrow
and
dirty
private
interests
and
who
demanded
a
similar
sacrifice
from
their
own
representatives
now
whine
that
the
proletariat
has
sacrificed
their
to
its
own
material
interests
this
bourgeois
class
now
strikes
the
attitude
of
a
pure
soul
misunderstood
and
abandoned
at
a
critical
moment
by
the
proletariat
that
has
been
misled
by
the
socialists
and
its
cry
finds
a
general
echo
in
the
bourgeois
world
of
course
i
do
not
refer
to
german
crossroad
politicians
and
kindred
blockheads
i
refer
for
instance
to
the
economist
which
as
late
as
november
that
is
to
say
four
days
before
the
coup
pronounced
bonaparte
the
guardian
of
order
and
thiers
and
berryer
anarchists
and
as
early
as
december
after
bonaparte
had
silenced
those
very
anarchists
cries
out
about
the
treason
committed
by
the
ignorant
untrained
and
stupid
proletaires
against
the
skill
knowledge
discipline
mental
influence
intellectual
resources
an
moral
weight
of
the
middle
and
upper
ranks
the
stupid
ignorant
and
contemptible
mass
was
none
other
than
the
bourgeoisie
itself
france
had
indeed
experienced
a
sort
of
commercial
crisis
in
at
the
end
of
february
there
was
a
falling
off
of
exports
as
compared
with
in
march
business
languished
and
factories
shut
down
in
april
the
condition
of
the
industrial
departments
seemed
as
desperate
as
after
the
february
days
in
may
business
did
not
yet
pick
up
as
late
as
june
the
reports
of
the
bank
of
france
revealed
through
a
tremendous
increase
of
deposits
and
an
equal
decrease
of
loans
on
exchange
notes
the
standstill
of
production
not
until
the
middle
of
october
did
a
steady
improvement
of
business
set
in
the
french
bourgeoisie
accounted
for
this
stagnation
of
business
with
purely
political
reasons
it
imputed
the
dull
times
to
the
strife
between
the
parliament
and
the
executive
power
to
the
uncertainty
of
a
provisional
form
of
government
to
the
alarming
prospects
of
may
i
shall
not
deny
that
all
these
causes
did
depress
some
branches
of
industry
in
paris
and
in
the
departments
at
any
rate
this
effect
of
political
circumstances
was
only
local
and
trifling
is
there
any
other
proof
needed
than
that
the
improvement
in
business
set
in
at
the
very
time
when
the
political
situation
was
growing
worse
when
the
political
horizon
was
growing
darker
and
when
at
every
moment
a
stroke
of
lightning
was
expected
out
of
the
elysee
in
the
middle
of
october
the
french
bourgeois
whose
skill
knowledge
mental
influence
and
intellectual
resources
reach
no
further
than
his
nose
could
moreover
during
the
whole
period
of
the
industrial
exposition
in
london
have
struck
with
his
nose
the
cause
of
his
own
business
misery
at
the
same
time
that
in
france
the
factories
were
being
closed
commercial
failures
broke
out
in
england
while
the
industrial
panic
reached
its
height
during
april
and
may
in
france
in
england
the
commercial
panic
reached
its
height
in
april
and
may
the
same
as
the
french
the
english
woolen
industries
suffered
and
as
the
french
so
did
the
english
silk
manufacture
though
the
english
cotton
factories
went
on
working
it
nevertheless
was
not
with
the
same
old
profit
of
and
the
only
difference
was
this
that
in
france
the
crisis
was
an
industrial
in
england
it
was
a
commercial
one
that
while
in
france
the
factories
stood
still
they
spread
themselves
in
england
but
under
less
favorable
circumstances
than
they
had
done
the
years
just
previous
that
in
france
the
export
in
england
the
import
trade
suffered
the
heaviest
blows
the
common
cause
which
as
a
matter
of
fact
is
not
to
be
looked
for
the
bounds
of
the
french
political
horizon
was
obvious
the
years
and
were
years
of
the
greatest
material
prosperity
and
of
an
overproduction
that
did
not
manifest
itself
until
this
was
especially
promoted
at
the
beginning
of
by
the
prospect
of
the
industrial
exposition
and
as
special
causes
there
were
added
first
the
failure
of
the
cotton
crop
of
and
second
the
certainty
of
a
larger
cotton
crop
than
was
expected
first
the
rise
then
the
sudden
drop
in
short
the
oscillations
of
the
cotton
market
the
crop
of
raw
silk
in
france
had
been
below
the
average
finally
the
manufacture
of
woolen
goods
had
received
such
an
increment
since
that
the
production
of
wool
could
not
keep
step
with
it
and
the
price
of
the
raw
material
rose
greatly
out
of
proportion
to
the
price
of
the
manufactured
goods
accordingly
we
have
here
in
the
raw
material
of
three
staple
articles
a
threefold
material
for
a
commercial
crisis
apart
from
these
special
circumstances
the
seeming
crisis
of
the
year
was
after
all
nothing
but
the
halt
that
overproduction
and
overspeculation
make
regularly
in
the
course
of
the
industrial
cycle
before
pulling
all
their
forces
together
in
order
to
rush
feverishly
over
the
last
stretch
and
arrive
again
at
their
point
of
departure
the
general
commercial
crisis
at
such
intervals
in
the
history
of
trade
commercial
failures
break
out
in
england
while
in
france
industry
itself
is
stopped
partly
because
it
is
compelled
to
retreat
through
the
competition
of
the
english
that
at
such
times
becomes
resistless
in
all
markets
and
partly
because
as
an
industry
of
luxuries
it
is
affected
with
preference
by
every
stoppage
of
trade
thus
besides
the
general
crisis
france
experiences
her
own
national
crises
which
are
determined
by
and
conditioned
upon
the
general
state
of
the
market
much
more
than
by
local
french
influences
it
will
not
be
devoid
of
interest
to
contrast
the
prejudgment
of
the
french
bourgeois
with
the
judgment
of
the
english
bourgeois
one
of
the
largest
liverpool
firms
writes
in
its
yearly
report
of
trade
for
few
years
have
more
completely
disappointed
the
expectations
entertained
at
their
beginning
than
the
year
that
has
just
passed
instead
of
the
great
prosperity
that
was
unanimously
looked
forward
to
it
proved
itself
one
of
the
most
discouraging
years
during
the
last
quarter
of
a
century
this
applies
of
course
only
to
the
mercantile
not
to
the
industrial
classes
and
yet
surely
there
were
grounds
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
from
which
to
draw
a
contrary
conclusion
the
stock
of
products
was
scanty
capital
was
abundant
provisions
cheap
a
rich
autumn
was
assured
there
was
uninterrupted
peace
on
the
continent
and
no
political
and
financial
disturbances
at
home
indeed
never
were
the
wings
of
trade
more
unshackled
what
is
this
unfavorable
result
to
be
ascribed
to
we
believe
to
excessive
trade
in
imports
as
well
as
exports
if
our
merchants
do
not
themselves
rein
in
their
activity
nothing
can
keep
us
going
except
a
panic
every
three
years
imagine
now
the
french
bourgeois
in
the
midst
of
this
business
panic
having
his
brain
tortured
buzzed
at
and
deafened
with
rumors
of
a
coup
and
the
restoration
of
universal
suffrage
with
the
struggle
between
the
legislature
and
the
executive
with
the
fronde
warfare
between
orleanists
and
legitimists
with
communistic
conspiracies
in
southern
france
with
alleged
jacqueries
peasant
revolts
in
the
departments
of
nievre
and
cher
with
the
advertisements
of
the
several
candidates
for
president
with
social
solutions
huckstered
about
by
the
journals
with
the
threats
of
the
republicans
to
uphold
arms
in
hand
the
constitution
and
universal
suffrage
with
the
gospels
according
to
the
emigrant
heroes
in
partibus
who
announced
the
destruction
of
the
world
for
may
imagine
that
and
one
can
understand
how
the
bourgeois
in
this
unspeakable
and
noisy
confusion
of
fusion
revision
prorogation
constitution
conspiracy
coalition
emigration
usurpation
and
revolution
blurts
out
at
his
parliamentary
republic
rather
an
end
with
fright
than
a
fright
without
end
bonaparte
understood
this
cry
his
perspicacity
was
sharpened
by
the
growing
anxiety
of
the
creditors
class
who
with
every
sunset
that
brought
nearer
the
day
of
payment
the
of
may
saw
in
the
motion
of
the
stars
a
protest
against
their
earthly
drafts
they
had
become
regular
astrologers
the
national
assembly
had
cut
off
hope
of
a
constitutional
prolongation
of
his
term
the
candidature
of
the
prince
of
joinville
tolerated
no
further
vacillation
if
ever
an
event
cast
its
shadow
before
it
long
before
its
occurrence
it
was
bonaparte
coup
already
on
january
barely
a
month
after
his
election
he
had
made
to
changarnier
a
proposition
to
that
effect
his
own
prime
minister
odillon
barrot
had
covertly
in
and
thiers
openly
in
the
winter
of
revealed
the
scheme
of
the
coup
in
may
persigny
had
again
sought
to
win
changarnier
over
to
the
coup
and
the
miessager
de
newspaper
had
published
this
conversation
at
every
parliamentary
storm
the
bonapartist
papers
threatened
a
coup
and
the
nearer
the
crisis
approached
all
the
louder
grew
their
tone
at
the
orgies
that
bonaparte
celebrated
every
night
with
a
swell
mob
of
males
and
females
every
time
the
hour
of
midnight
drew
nigh
and
plenteous
libations
had
loosened
the
tongues
and
heated
the
minds
of
the
revelers
the
coup
was
resolved
upon
for
the
next
morning
swords
were
then
drawn
glasses
clinked
the
representatives
were
thrown
out
at
the
windows
the
imperial
mantle
fell
upon
the
shoulders
of
bonaparte
until
the
next
morning
again
drove
away
the
spook
and
astonished
paris
learned
from
not
very
reserved
vestals
and
indiscreet
paladins
the
danger
it
had
once
more
escaped
during
the
months
of
september
and
october
the
rumors
of
a
coup
tumbled
close
upon
one
another
heels
at
the
same
time
the
shadow
gathered
color
like
a
confused
daguerreotype
follow
the
issues
of
the
european
daily
press
for
the
months
of
september
and
october
and
items
like
this
will
be
found
literally
rumors
of
a
fill
paris
the
capital
it
is
said
is
to
be
filled
with
troops
by
night
and
the
next
morning
decrees
are
to
be
issued
dissolving
the
national
assembly
placing
the
department
of
the
seine
in
state
of
siege
restoring
universal
suffrage
and
appealing
to
the
people
bonaparte
is
rumored
to
be
looking
for
ministers
to
execute
these
illegal
decrees
the
newspaper
correspondence
that
brought
this
news
always
close
ominously
with
postponed
the
coup
was
ever
the
fixed
idea
of
bonaparte
with
this
idea
he
had
stepped
again
upon
french
soil
it
had
such
full
possession
of
him
that
he
was
constantly
betraying
and
blabbing
it
out
he
was
so
weak
that
he
was
as
constantly
giving
it
up
again
the
shadow
of
the
coup
had
become
so
familiar
a
spectre
to
the
parisians
that
they
refused
to
believe
it
when
it
finally
did
appear
in
flesh
and
blood
consequently
it
was
neither
the
reticent
backwardness
of
the
chief
of
the
society
of
december
nor
an
unthought
of
surprise
of
the
national
assembly
that
caused
the
success
of
the
coup
when
it
succeeded
it
did
so
despite
his
indiscretion
and
with
its
anticipation
a
necessary
unavoidable
result
of
the
development
that
had
preceded
on
october
bonaparte
announced
to
his
ministers
his
decision
to
restore
universal
suffrage
on
the
day
they
handed
in
their
resignations
on
the
paris
learned
of
the
formation
of
the
thorigny
ministry
the
prefect
of
police
carlier
was
simultaneously
replaced
by
maupas
and
the
chief
of
the
first
military
division
magnan
concentrated
the
most
reliable
regiments
in
the
capital
on
november
the
national
assembly
its
sessions
there
was
nothing
left
for
it
to
do
but
to
repeat
in
short
recapitulation
the
course
it
had
traversed
and
to
prove
that
it
had
been
buried
only
after
it
had
expired
the
first
post
that
it
had
forfeited
in
the
struggle
with
the
executive
was
the
ministry
it
had
solemnly
to
admit
this
loss
by
accepting
as
genuine
the
thorigny
ministry
which
was
but
a
pretence
the
permanent
committee
had
received
giraud
with
laughter
when
he
introduced
himself
in
the
name
of
the
new
ministers
so
weak
a
ministry
for
so
strong
a
measure
as
the
restoration
of
universal
suffrage
the
question
however
then
was
to
do
nothing
in
everything
against
the
parliament
on
the
very
day
of
its
the
national
assembly
received
the
message
from
bonaparte
demanding
the
restoration
of
universal
suffrage
and
the
repeal
of
the
law
of
may
on
the
same
day
his
ministers
introduced
a
decree
to
that
effect
the
assembly
promptly
rejected
the
motion
of
urgency
made
by
the
ministers
but
repealed
the
law
itself
on
november
by
a
vote
of
against
thus
it
once
more
tore
to
pieces
its
own
mandate
once
more
certified
to
the
fact
that
it
had
transformed
itself
from
a
freely
chosen
representative
body
of
the
nation
into
the
usurpatory
parliament
of
a
class
it
once
more
admitted
that
it
had
itself
severed
the
muscles
that
connected
the
parliamentary
head
with
the
body
of
the
nation
while
the
executive
power
appealed
from
the
national
assembly
to
the
people
by
its
motion
for
the
restoration
of
universal
suffrage
the
legislative
power
appealed
from
the
people
to
the
army
by
its
bill
this
bill
was
to
establish
its
right
to
immediate
requisitions
for
troops
to
build
up
a
parliamentary
army
by
thus
appointing
the
army
umpire
between
itself
and
the
people
between
itself
and
bonaparte
by
thus
recognizing
the
army
as
the
decisive
power
in
the
state
the
national
assembly
was
constrained
to
admit
that
it
had
long
given
up
all
claim
to
supremacy
by
debating
the
right
to
make
requisitions
for
troops
instead
of
forthwith
collecting
them
it
betrayed
its
own
doubts
touching
its
own
power
by
thus
subsequently
rejecting
the
bill
it
publicly
confessed
it
impotence
the
bill
fell
through
with
a
minority
of
votes
the
mountain
had
accordingly
thrown
the
casting
vote
it
now
found
itself
in
the
predicament
of
buridan
donkey
not
indeed
between
two
sacks
of
hay
forced
to
decide
which
of
the
two
was
the
more
attractive
but
between
two
showers
of
blows
forced
to
decide
which
of
the
two
was
the
harder
fear
of
changarnier
on
one
side
fear
of
bonaparte
on
the
other
it
must
be
admitted
the
position
was
not
a
heroic
one
on
november
an
amendment
was
moved
to
the
act
passed
by
the
party
of
order
on
municipal
elections
to
the
effect
that
instead
of
three
years
a
domicile
of
one
year
should
suffice
the
amendment
was
lost
by
a
single
vote
but
this
vote
it
soon
transpired
was
a
mistake
owing
to
the
divisions
within
its
own
hostile
factions
the
party
of
order
had
long
since
forfeited
its
independent
parliamentary
majority
it
was
now
plain
that
there
was
no
longer
any
majority
in
the
parliament
the
national
assembly
had
become
impotent
even
to
decide
its
atomic
parts
were
no
longer
held
together
by
any
cohesive
power
it
had
expended
its
last
breath
it
was
dead
finally
the
mass
of
the
bourgeoisie
outside
of
the
parliament
was
once
more
solemnly
to
confirm
its
rupture
with
the
bourgeoisie
inside
of
the
parliament
a
few
days
before
the
catastrophe
thiers
as
a
parliamentary
hero
conspicuously
smitten
by
that
incurable
disease
parliamentary
idiocy
had
hatched
out
jointly
with
the
council
of
state
after
the
death
of
the
parliament
a
new
parliamentary
intrigue
in
the
shape
of
a
responsibility
law
that
was
intended
to
lock
up
the
president
within
the
walls
of
the
constitution
the
same
as
on
september
bonaparte
bewitched
the
fishwives
like
a
second
massaniello
on
the
occasion
of
laying
the
for
the
market
of
paris
though
it
must
be
admitted
one
fishwife
was
equal
to
seventeen
burgraves
in
real
power
the
same
as
after
the
introduction
of
the
questors
bill
he
enthused
the
lieutenants
who
were
being
treated
at
the
elysee
so
likewise
did
he
now
on
november
carry
away
with
him
the
industrial
bourgeoisie
assembled
at
the
circus
to
receive
from
his
hands
the
that
had
been
awarded
at
the
london
industrial
exposition
i
here
reproduce
the
typical
part
of
his
speech
from
the
journal
des
debats
with
such
unhoped
for
successes
i
am
justified
to
repeat
how
great
the
french
republic
would
be
if
she
were
only
allowed
to
pursue
her
real
interests
and
reform
her
institutions
instead
of
being
constantly
disturbed
in
this
by
demagogues
on
one
side
and
on
the
other
by
monarchic
hallucinations
loud
stormy
and
continued
applause
from
all
parts
of
the
amphitheater
the
monarchic
hallucinations
hamper
all
progress
and
all
serious
departments
of
industry
instead
of
progress
we
have
struggle
only
men
formerly
the
most
zealous
supporters
of
royal
authority
and
prerogative
become
the
partisans
of
a
convention
that
has
no
purpose
other
than
to
weaken
an
authority
that
is
born
of
universal
suffrage
loud
and
prolonged
applause
we
see
men
who
have
suffered
most
from
the
revolution
and
complained
bitterest
of
it
provoking
a
new
one
for
the
sole
purpose
of
putting
fetters
on
the
will
of
the
nation
i
promise
you
peace
for
the
future
bravo
bravo
stormy
bravos
thus
the
industrial
bourgeoisie
shouts
its
servile
bravo
to
the
coup
of
december
to
the
destruction
of
the
parliament
to
the
downfall
of
their
own
reign
to
the
dictatorship
of
bonaparte
the
rear
of
the
applause
of
november
was
responded
to
by
the
roar
of
cannon
on
december
and
the
house
of
sallandrouze
who
had
been
loudest
in
applauding
was
the
one
demolished
by
most
of
the
bombs
cromwell
when
he
dissolved
the
long
parliament
walked
alone
into
its
midst
pulled
out
his
watch
in
order
that
the
body
should
not
continue
to
exist
one
minute
beyond
the
term
fixed
for
it
by
him
and
drove
out
each
individual
member
with
gay
and
humorous
invectives
napoleon
smaller
than
his
prototype
at
least
went
on
the
brumaire
into
the
legislative
body
and
though
in
a
tremulous
voice
read
to
it
its
sentence
of
death
the
second
bonaparte
who
moreover
found
himself
in
possession
of
an
executive
power
very
different
from
that
of
either
cromwell
or
napoleon
did
not
look
for
his
model
in
the
annals
of
universal
history
but
in
the
annals
of
the
society
of
december
in
the
annals
of
criminal
jurisprudence
he
robs

he
shortly
after
sneaked
into

a
false

according
to
which
influential

grouped
themselves
round
him
in

it
goes

behind

then
appropriates
the
whole
stage
it
lives
its

the

buries
it
under

the

fear

no

distorted
with

charms
the
work

of

into
a
monstrosity
that
republic
lost
nothing
but
the
appearance
of
decency
the
france
of
was
within
the
womb
of
the
parliamentary
republic
all
that
was
wanted
was
a
bayonet
thrust
in
order
that
the
bubble
burst
and
the
monster
leap
forth
to
sight
why
did
not
the
parisian
proletariat
rise
after
the
of
december
the
downfall
of
the
bourgeoisie
was
as
yet
merely
decreed
the
decree
was
not
yet
executed
any
earnest
uprising
of
the
proletariat
would
have
forthwith
revived
this
bourgeoisie
would
have
brought
on
its
reconciliation
with
the
army
and
would
have
insured
a
second
june
rout
to
the
workingmen
on
december
the
proletariat
was
incited
to
fight
by
bourgeois
on
the
evening
of
that
day
several
legions
of
the
national
guard
promised
to
appear
armed
and
uniformed
on
the
place
of
battle
this
arose
from
the
circumstance
that
bourgeois
had
got
wind
that
in
one
of
his
decrees
of
december
bonaparte
abolished
the
secret
ballot
and
ordered
them
to
enter
the
words
yes
and
no
after
their
names
in
the
official
register
bonaparte
took
alarm
at
the
stand
taken
on
december
during
the
night
he
caused
placards
to
be
posted
on
all
the
street
corners
of
paris
announcing
the
restoration
of
the
secret
ballot
bourgeois
believed
they
had
gained
their
point
the
absentees
the
next
morning
were
messieurs
bourgeois
during
the
night
of
december
and
the
parisian
proletariat
was
robbed
of
its
leaders
and
chiefs
of
barricades
by
a
raid
of
bonaparte
an
army
without
officers
disinclined
by
the
recollections
of
june
and
and
may
to
fight
under
the
banner
of
the
montagnards
it
left
to
its
vanguard
the
secret
societies
the
work
of
saving
the
insurrectionary
honor
of
paris
which
the
bourgeoisie
had
yielded
to
the
soldiery
so
submissively
that
bonaparte
was
later
justified
in
disarming
the
national
guard
upon
the
scornful
ground
that
he
feared
their
arms
would
be
used
against
themselves
by
the
anarchists
ic
triomphe
complet
et
definitif
du
socialism
thus
did
guizot
characterize
the
of
december
but
although
the
downfall
of
the
parliamentary
republic
carries
with
it
the
germ
of
the
triumph
of
the
proletarian
revolution
its
immediate
and
tangible
result
was
the
triumph
of
bonaparte
over
parliament
of
the
executive
over
the
legislative
power
of
force
without
phrases
over
the
force
of
phrases
in
the
parliament
the
nation
raised
its
collective
will
to
the
dignity
of
law
it
raised
the
law
of
the
ruling
class
to
the
dignity
of
its
collective
will
before
the
executive
power
the
nation
abdicates
all
will
of
its
own
and
submits
to
the
orders
of
an
outsider
of
authority
in
contrast
with
the
legislative
the
executive
power
expresses
the
heteronomy
of
the
nation
in
contrast
with
its
autonomy
accordingly
france
seems
to
have
escaped
the
despotism
of
a
class
only
in
order
to
fall
under
the
despotism
of
an
individual
under
the
authority
at
that
of
an
individual
without
authority
the
struggle
seems
to
settle
down
to
the
point
where
all
classes
drop
down
on
their
knees
equally
impotent
and
equally
dumb
all
the
same
the
revolution
is
thoroughgoing
it
still
is
on
its

methodically
down

it

it

the
other
half
it

ripens
the

maturity
in

to
be

that

that

to

it

well
hast
thou
grubbed
old
mole
the
executive
power
with
its
tremendous
bureaucratic
and
military
organization
with
its
and
artificial
machinery
of
government
an
army
of
half
a
million
strong
together
with
a
military
force
of
another
million
men
this
fearful
body
of
parasites
that
coils
itself
like
a
snake
around
french
society
stopping
all
its
pores
originated
at
the
time
of
the
absolute
monarchy
along
with
the
decline
of
feudalism
which
it
helped
to
hasten
the
princely
privileges
of
the
landed
proprietors
and
cities
were
transformed
into
so
many
of
the
executive

the
feudal

into
paid
and
the
confusing
design
of
conflicting
medieval
seigniories
into
the
well
regulated
plan
of
a
government
work
is
subdivided
and
centralized
as
in
the
factory
the
first
french
revolution
having
as
a
mission
to
sweep
away
all
local
territorial
urban
and
provincial
special
privileges
with
the
object
of
establishing
the
civic
unity
of
the
nation
was
hound
to
develop
what
the
absolute
monarchy
had
begun
the
work
of
centralization
together
with
the
range
the
attributes
and
the
menials
of
government
napoleon
completed
this
governmental
machinery
the
legitimist
and
the
july
monarchy
contribute
nothing
thereto
except
a
greater
subdivision
of
labor
that
grew
in
the
same
measure
as
the
division
and
subdivision
of
labor
within
bourgeois
society
raised
new
groups
and
interests
new
material
for
the
administration
of
government
each
common
interest
was
in
turn
forthwith
removed
from
society
set
up
against
it
as
a
higher
collective
interest
wrested
from
the
individual
activity
of
the
members
of
society
and
turned
into
a
subject
for
governmental
administration
from
the
bridges
the
school
house
and
the
communal
property
of
a
village
community
up
to
the
railroads
the
national
wealth
and
the
national
university
of
france
finally
the
parliamentary
republic
found
itself
in
its
struggle
against
the
revolution
compelled
with
its
repressive
measures
to
strengthen
the
means
and
the
centralization
of
the
government
each
overturn
instead
of
breaking
up
carried
this
machine
to
higher
perfection
the
parties
that
alternately
wrestled
for
supremacy
looked
upon
the
possession
of
this
tremendous
governmental
structure
as
the
principal
spoils
of
their
victory
nevertheless
under
the
absolute
monarchy
was
only
the
means
whereby
the
first
revolution
and
under
napoleon
to
prepare
the
class
rule
of
the
bourgeoisie
under
the
restoration
under
louis
philippe
and
under
the
parliamentary
republic
it
was
the
instrument
of
the
ruling
class
however
eagerly
this
class
strained
after
autocracy
not
before
the
advent
of
the
second
bonaparte
does
the
government
seem
to
have
made
itself
fully
independent
the
machinery
of
government
has
by
this
time
so
thoroughly
fortified
itself
against
society
that
the
chief
of
the
society
of
december
is
thought
good
enough
to
be
at
its
head
a
run
in
from
abroad
is
raised
on
its
shield
by
a
drunken
soldiery
bought
by
himself
with
liquor
and
sausages
and
whom
he
is
forced
ever
again
to
throw
sops
to
hence
the
timid
despair
the
sense
of
crushing
humiliation
and
degradation
that
oppresses
the
breast
of
france
and
makes
her
to
choke
she
feels
dishonored
and
yet
the
french
government
does
not
float
in
the
air
bonaparte
represents
an
economic
class
and
that
the
most
numerous
in
the
commonweal
of
france
the
allotment
farmer
the
first
french
revolution
distributed
the
bulk
of
the
territory
of
france
held
at
the
time
by
the
feudal
lords
in
small
patches
among
the
cultivators
of
the
soil
this
allotment
of
lands
created
the
french
farmer
class
as
the
bourbons
are
the
dynasty
of
large
landed
property
as
the
orleans
are
the
dynasty
of
money
so
are
the
bonapartes
the
dynasty
of
the
farmer
of
the
french
masses
not
the
bonaparte
who
threw
himself
at
the
feet
of
the
bourgeois
parliament
but
the
bonaparte
who
swept
away
the
bourgeois
parliament
is
the
elect
of
this
farmer
class
for
three
years
the
cities
had
succeeded
in
falsifying
the
meaning
of
the
election
of
december
and
in
cheating
the
farmer
out
of
the
restoration
of
the
empire
the
election
of
december
is
not
carried
out
until
the
coup
of
december
the
allotment
farmers
are
an
immense
mass
whose
individual
members
live
in
identical
conditions
without
however
entering
into
manifold
relations
with
one
another
their
method
of
production
isolates
them
from
one
another
instead
of
drawing
them
into
mutual
intercourse
this
isolation
is
promoted
by
the
poor
means
of
communication
in
france
together
with
the
poverty
of
the
farmers
themselves
their
field
of
production
the
small
allotment
of
land
that
each
cultivates
allows
no
room
for
a
division
of
labor
and
no
opportunity
for
the
application
of
science
in
other
words
it
shuts
out
manifoldness
of
development
diversity
of
talent
and
the
luxury
of
social
relations
every
single
farmer
family
is
almost
itself
produces
directly
the
greater
part
of
what
it
consumes
and
it
earns
its
livelihood
more
by
means
of
an
interchange
with
nature
than
by
intercourse
with
society
we
have
the
allotted
patch
of
land
the
farmer
and
his
family
alongside
of
that
another
allotted
patch
of
land
another
farmer
and
another
family
a
bunch
of
these
makes
up
a
village
a
bunch
of
villages
makes
up
a
department
thus
the
large
mass
of
the
french
nation
is
constituted
by
the
simple
addition
of
equal
magnitudes
much
as
a
bag
with
potatoes
constitutes
a
in
so
far
as
millions
of
families
live
under
economic
conditions
that
separate
their
mode
of
life
their
interests
and
their
culture
from
those
of
the
other
classes
and
that
place
them
in
an
attitude
hostile
toward
the
latter
they
constitute
a
class
in
so
far
as
there
exists
only
a
local
connection
among
these
farmers
a
connection
which
the
individuality
and
exclusiveness
of
their
interests
prevent
from
generating
among
them
any
unity
of
interest
national
connections
and
political
organization
they
do
not
constitute
a
class
consequently
they
are
unable
to
assert
their
class
interests
in
their
own
name
be
it
by
a
parliament
or
by
convention
they
can
not
represent
one
another
they
must
themselves
be
represented
their
representative
must
at
the
same
time
appear
as
their
master
as
an
authority
over
them
as
an
unlimited
governmental
power
that
protects
them
from
above
bestows
rain
and
sunshine
upon
them
accordingly
the
political
influence
of
the
allotment
farmer
finds
its
ultimate
expression
in
an
executive
power
that
subjugates
the
commonweal
to
its
own
autocratic
will
historic
tradition
has
given
birth
to
the
superstition
among
the
french
farmers
that
a
man
named
napoleon
would
restore
to
them
all
manner
of
glory
now
then
an
individual
turns
i
up
who
gives
himself
out
as
that
man
because
obedient
to
the
code
napoleon
which
provides
that
la
recherche
de
la
paternite
est
interdite
the
inquiry
into
paternity
is
forbidden
he
carries
the
name
of
napoleon
bonaparte
is
said
to
have
been
an
illegitimate
son
after
a
vagabondage
of
twenty
years
and
a
series
of
grotesque
adventures
the
myth
is
verified
and
that
man
becomes
the
emperor
of
the
french
the
rooted
thought
of
the
nephew
becomes
a
reality
because
it
coincided
with
the
rooted
thought
of
the
most
numerous
class
among
the
french
but
i
shall
be
objected
to
what
about
the
farmers
uprisings
over
half
france
the
raids
of
the
army
upon
the
farmers
the
wholesale
imprisonment
and
transportation
of
farmers
indeed
since
louis
france
has
not
experienced
such
persecutions
of
the
farmer
on
the
ground
of
his
demagogic
machinations
but
this
should
be
well
understood
the
bonaparte
dynasty
does
not
represent
the
revolutionary
it
represents
the
conservative
farmer
it
does
not
represent
the
farmer
who
presses
beyond
his
own
economic
conditions
his
little
allotment
of
land
it
represents
him
rather
who
would
confirm
these
conditions
it
does
not
represent
the
rural
population
that
thanks
to
its
own
inherent
energy
wishes
jointly
with
the
cities
to
overthrow
the
old
order
it
represents
on
the
contrary
the
rural
population
that
in
the
old
order
seeks
to
see
itself
together
with
its
allotments
saved
and
favored
by
the
ghost
of
the
empire
it
represents
not
the
intelligence
but
the
superstition
of
the
farmer
not
his
judgment
but
his
bias
not
his
future
but
his
past
not
his
modern
cevennes
the
cevennes
were
the
theater
of
the
most
numerous
revolutionary
uprisings
of
the
farmer
class
but
his
modern
vendee
la
vendee
was
the
theater
of
protracted
reactionary
uprisings
of
the
farmer
class
under
the
first
revolution
the
three
years
severe
rule
of
the
parliamentary
republic
had
freed
a
part
of
the
french
farmers
from
the
napoleonic
illusion
and
though
even
only
superficially
had
revolutionized
them
the
bourgeoisie
threw
them
however
violently
back
every
time
that
they
set
themselves
in
motion
under
the
parliamentary
republic
the
modern
wrestled
with
the
traditional
consciousness
of
the
french
farmer
the
process
went
on
in
the
form
of
a
continuous
struggle
between
the
school
teachers
and
the
parsons
the
bourgeoisie
knocked
the
school
teachers
down
for
the
first
time
the
farmer
made
an
effort
to
take
an
independent
stand
in
the
government
of
the
country
this
manifested
itself
in
the
prolonged
conflicts
of
the
mayors
with
the
prefects
the
bourgeoisie
deposed
the
mayors
finally
during
period
of
the
parliamentary
republic
the
farmers
of
several
localities
rose
against
their
own
product
the
army
the
bourgeoisie
punished
them
with
states
of
siege
and
executions
and
this
is
the
identical
bourgeoisie
that
now
howls
over
the
stupidity
of
the
masses
over
the
vile
multitude
which
it
claims
betrayed
it
to
bonaparte
itself
has
violently
fortified
the
imperialism
of
the
farmer
class
it
firmly
maintained
the
conditions
that
constitute
the
of
this
indeed
the
bourgeoisie
has
every
reason
to
fear
the
stupidity
of
the
masses
so
long
as
they
remain
conservative
and
their
intelligence
so
soon
as
they
become
revolutionary
in
the
revolts
that
took
place
after
the
coup
a
part
of
the
french
farmers
protested
arms
in
hand
against
their
own
vote
of
december
the
school
house
had
since
sharpened
their
wits
but
they
had
bound
themselves
over
to
the
nether
world
of
history
and
history
kept
them
to
their
word
moreover
the
majority
of
this
population
was
still
so
full
of
prejudices
that
just
in
the
reddest
departments
it
voted
openly
for
bonaparte
the
national
assembly
prevented
as
it
thought
this
population
from
walking
the
farmers
now
snapped
the
fetters
which
the
cities
had
struck
upon
the
will
of
the
country
districts
in
some
places
they
even
indulged
the
grotesque
hallucination
of
a
convention
together
with
a
napoleon
after
the
first
revolution
had
converted
the
serf
farmers
into
freeholders
napoleon
fixed
and
regulated
the
conditions
under
which
unmolested
they
could
exploit
the
soil
of
france
that
had
just
fallen
into
their
hands
and
expiate
the
youthful
passion
for
property
but
that
which
now
bears
the
french
farmer
down
is
that
very
allotment
of
land
it
is
the
partition
of
the
soil
the
form
of
ownership
which
napoleon
had
consolidated
these
are
the
material
condition
that
turned
french
feudal
peasant
into
a
small
or
allotment
farmer
and
napoleon
into
an
emperor
two
generations
have
sufficed
to
produce
the
inevitable
result
the
progressive
deterioration
of
agriculture
and
the
progressive
encumbering
of
the
agriculturist
the
napoleonic
form
of
ownership
which
at
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
was
the
condition
for
the
emancipation
and
enrichment
of
the
french
rural
population
has
in
the
course
of
the
century
developed
into
the
law
of
their
enslavement
and
pauperism
now
then
this
very
law
is
the
first
of
the
idees
napoleoniennes
which
the
second
bonaparte
must
uphold
if
he
still
shares
with
the
farmers
the
illusion
of
seeking
not
in
the
system
of
the
small
allotment
itself
but
outside
of
that
system
in
the
influence
of
secondary
conditions
the
cause
of
their
ruin
his
experiments
are
bound
to
burst
like
against
the
modern
system
of
production
the
economic
development
of
the
allotment
system
has
turned
bottom
upward
the
relation
of
the
farmer
to
the
other
classes
of
society
under
napoleon
the
parceling
out
of
the
agricultural
lands
into
small
allotments
supplemented
in
the
country
the
free
competition
and
the
incipient
large
production
of
the
cities
the
farmer
class
was
the
ubiquitous
protest
against
the
aristocracy
of
land
just
then
overthrown
the
roots
that
the
system
of
small
allotments
cast
into
the
soil
of
france
deprived
feudalism
of
all
nutriment
its
constituted
the
natural
buttress
of
the
bourgeoisie
against
every
stroke
of
the
old
overlords
but
in
the
course
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
city
usurer
stepped
into
the
shoes
of
the
feudal
lord
the
mortgage
substituted
the
feudal
duties
formerly
yielded
by
the
soil
bourgeois
capital
took
the
place
of
the
aristocracy
of
landed
property
the
former
allotments
are
now
only
a
pretext
that
allows
the
capitalist
class
to
draw
profit
interest
and
rent
from
agricultural
lands
and
to
leave
to
the
farmer
himself
the
task
of
seeing
to
it
that
he
knock
out
his
wages
the
mortgage
indebtedness
that
burdens
the
soil
of
france
imposes
upon
the
french
farmer
class
they
payment
of
an
interest
as
great
as
the
annual
interest
on
the
whole
british
national
debt
in
this
slavery
of
capital
whither
its
development
drives
it
irresistibly
the
allotment
system
has
transformed
the
mass
of
the
french
nation
into
troglodytes
sixteen
million
farmers
women
and
children
included
house
in
hovels
most
of
which
have
only
one
opening
some
two
and
the
few
most
favored
ones
three
windows
are
to
a
house
what
the
five
senses
are
to
the
head
the
bourgeois
social
order
which
at
the
beginning
of
the
century
placed
the
state
as
a
sentinel
before
the
newly
instituted
allotment
and
that
manured
this
with
laurels
has
become
a
vampire
that
sucks
out
its
and
its
very
brain
and
throws
it
into
the
pot
of
capital
the
code
napoleon
is
now
but
the
codex
of
execution
of
sheriff
sales
and
of
intensified
taxation
to
the
four
million
children
included
official
paupers
vagabonds
criminals
and
prostitutes
that
france
numbers
must
be
added
five
million
souls
who
hover
over
the
precipice
of
life
and
either
sojourn
in
the
country
itself
or
float
with
their
rags
and
their
children
from
the
country
to
the
cities
and
from
the
cities
back
to
the
country
accordingly
the
interests
of
the
farmers
are
no
longer
as
under
napoleon
in
harmony
but
in
conflict
with
the
interests
of
the
bourgeoisie
with
capital
they
find
their
natural
allies
and
leaders
among
the
urban
proletariat
whose
mission
is
the
overthrow
of
the
bourgeois
social
order
but
the
strong
and
unlimited
government
and
this
is
the
second
of
the
idees
napoleoniennes
which
the
second
napoleon
has
to
carried
out
has
for
its
mission
the
forcible
defence
of
this
very
material
social
order
a
material
order
that
furnishes
the
slogan
in
bonaparte
proclamations
against
the
farmers
in
revolt
along
with
the
mortgage
imposed
by
capital
upon
the
farmer
allotment
this
is
burdened
by
taxation
taxation
is
the
fountain
of
life
to
the
bureaucracy
the
army
the
parsons
and
the
court
in
short
to
the
whole
apparatus
of
the
executive
power
a
strong
government
and
heavy
taxes
are
identical
the
system
of
ownership
involved
in
the
system
of
allotments
lends
itself
by
nature
for
the
groundwork
of
a
powerful
and
numerous
bureaucracy
it
produces
an
even
level
of
conditions
and
of
persons
over
the
whole
surface
of
the
country
it
therefore
allows
the
exercise
of
an
even
influence
upon
all
parts
of
this
even
mass
from
a
high
central
point
downwards
it
annihilates
the
aristocratic
gradations
between
the
popular
masses
and
the
government
it
consequently
calls
from
all
sides
for
the
direct
intervention
of
the
government
and
for
the
intervention
of
the
latter
immediate
organs
and
finally
it
produces
an
unemployed
excess
of
population
that
finds
no
room
either
in
the
country
or
in
the
cities
that
consequently
snatches
after
public
office
as
a
sort
of
dignified
alms
and
provokes
the
creation
of
further
offices
with
the
new
markets
which
he
opened
at
the
point
of
the
bayonet
and
with
the
plunder
of
the
continent
napoleon
returned
to
the
farmer
class
with
interest
the
taxes
wrung
from
them
these
taxes
were
then
a
goad
to
the
industry
of
the
farmer
while
now
on
the
contrary
they
rob
his
industry
of
its
last
source
of
support
and
completely
sap
his
power
to
resist
poverty
indeed
an
enormous
bureaucracy
richly
gallooned
and
well
fed
is
that
idee
napoleonienne
that
above
all
others
suits
the
requirements
of
the
second
bonaparte
how
else
should
it
be
seeing
he
is
forced
to
raise
alongside
of
the
actual
classes
of
society
an
artificial
class
to
which
the
maintenance
of
his
own
regime
must
be
a
question
one
of
his
first
financial
operations
was
accordingly
the
raising
of
the
salaries
of
the
government
employees
to
their
former
standard
and
the
creation
of
new
sinecures
another
idee
napoleonienne
is
the
rule
of
the
parsons
as
an
instrument
of
government
but
while
the
allotment
in
harmony
with
society
in
its
dependence
upon
the
powers
of
nature
and
in
its
subordination
to
the
authority
that
protected
it
from
above
was
naturally
religious
the
allotment
on
the
contrary
at
odds
with
society
and
authority
and
driven
beyond
its
own
narrow
bounds
becomes
as
naturally
irreligious
heaven
was
quite
a
pretty
gift
thrown
in
with
the
narrow
strip
of
land
that
had
just
been
won
all
the
more
as
it
makes
the
weather
it
however
becomes
an
insult
from
the
moment
it
is
forced
upon
the
farmer
as
a
substitute
for
his
allotment
then
the
parson
appears
merely
as
the
anointed
of
the
earthly
police
yet
another
idee
napoleonienne
the
expedition
against
rome
will
next
time
take
place
in
france
but
in
a
reverse
sense
from
that
of
de
montalembert
finally
the
culminating
point
of
the
idees
napoleoniennes
is
the
preponderance
of
the
army
the
army
was
the
point
of
honor
with
the
allotment
farmers
it
was
themselves
turned
into
masters
defending
abroad
their
newly
established
property
glorifying
their
recently
conquered
nationality
plundering
and
revolutionizing
the
world
the
uniform
was
their
state
costume
war
was
their
poetry
the
allotment
expanded
and
rounded
up
in
their
phantasy
was
the
fatherland
and
patriotism
became
the
ideal
form
of
property
but
the
foe
against
whom
the
french
farmer
must
now
defend
his
property
are
not
the
cossacks
they
are
the
sheriffs
and
the
tax
collectors
the
allotment
no
longer
lies
in
the
fatherland
but
in
the
register
of
mortgages
the
army
itself
no
longer
is
the
flower
of
the
youth
of
the
farmers
it
is
the
of
the
of
the
farmer
class
it
consists
of
remplacants
substitutes
just
as
the
second
bonaparte
himself
is
but
a
remplacant
a
substitute
for
napoleon
its
feats
of
heroism
are
now
performed
in
raids
instituted
against
farmers
and
in
the
service
of
the
police
and
when
the
internal
contradictions
of
his
own
system
shall
drive
the
chief
of
the
society
of
december
across
the
french
frontier
that
army
will
after
a
few
gather
no
laurels
but
only
hard
knocks
it
is
evident
that
all
the
idees
napoleoniennes
are
the
ideas
of
the
undeveloped
and
youthfully
fresh
allotment
they
are
an
absurdity
for
the
allotment
that
now
survives
they
are
only
the
hallucinations
of
its
death
struggle
words
turned
to
hollow
phrases
spirits
turned
to
spooks
but
this
parody
of
the
empire
was
requisite
in
order
to
free
the
mass
of
the
french
nation
from
the
weight
of
tradition
and
to
elaborate
sharply
the
contrast
between
government
and
society
along
with
the
progressive
decay
of
the
allotment
the
governmental
structure
reared
upon
it
breaks
down
the
centralization
of
government
required
by
modern
society
rises
only
upon
the
ruins
of
the
military
and
bureaucratic
governmental
machinery
that
was
forged
in
contrast
to
feudalism
the
conditions
of
the
french
farmers
class
solve
to
us
the
riddle
of
the
general
elections
of
december
and
that
led
the
second
bonaparte
to
the
top
of
sinai
not
to
receive
but
to
decree
laws
the
bourgeoisie
had
now
manifestly
no
choice
but
to
elect
bonaparte
when
at
the
council
of
constance
the
puritans
complained
of
the
sinful
life
of
the
popes
and
moaned
about
the
need
of
a
reform
in
morals
cardinal
thundered
into
their
faces
only
the
devil
in
his
own
person
can
now
save
the
catholic
church
and
you
demand
angels
so
likewise
did
the
french
bourgeoisie
cry
out
after
the
coup
only
the
chief
of
the
of
december
can
now
save
bourgeois
society
only
theft
can
save
property
only
perjury
religion
only
bastardy
the
family
only
disorder
order
bonaparte
as
autocratic
executive
power
fulfills
his
mission
to
secure
bourgeois
order
but
the
strength
of
this
bourgeois
order
lies
in
the
middle
class
he
feels
himself
the
representative
of
the
middle
class
and
issues
his
decrees
in
that
sense
nevertheless
he
is
something
only
because
he
has
broken
the
political
power
of
this
class
and
daily
breaks
it
anew
hence
he
feels
himself
the
adversary
of
the
political
and
the
literary
power
of
the
middle
class
but
by
protecting
their
material
he
nourishes
anew
their
political
power
consequently
the
cause
must
be
kept
alive
but
the
result
wherever
it
manifests
itself
swept
out
of
existence
but
this
procedure
is
impossible
without
slight
mistakings
of
causes
and
effects
seeing
that
both
in
their
mutual
action
and
reaction
lose
their
distinctive
marks
thereupon
new
decrees
that
blur
the
line
of
distinction
bonaparte
furthermore
feels
himself
as
against
the
bourgeoisie
the
representative
of
the
farmer
and
the
people
in
general
who
within
bourgeois
society
is
to
render
the
lower
classes
of
society
happy
to
this
end
new
decrees
intended
to
exploit
the
true
socialists
together
with
their
governmental
wisdom
but
above
all
bonaparte
feels
himself
the
chief
of
the
society
of
december
the
representative
of
the
to
which
he
himself
his
immediate
surroundings
his
government
and
his
army
alike
belong
the
main
object
with
all
of
whom
is
to
be
good
to
themselves
and
draw
californian
tickets
out
of
the
national
treasury
an
he
affirms
his
chieftainship
of
the
society
of
december
with
decrees
without
decrees
and
despite
decrees
this
contradictory
mission
of
the
man
explains
the
contradictions
of
his
own
government
and
that
confused
groping
about
that
now
seeks
to
win
then
to
humiliate
now
this
class
and
then
that
and
finishes
by
arraying
against
itself
all
the
classes
whose
actual
insecurity
constitutes
a
highly
comical
contrast
with
the
imperious
categoric
style
of
the
government
acts
copied
closely
from
the
uncle
industry
and
commerce
the
business
of
the
middle
class
are
to
be
made
to
blossom
in
style
under
the
strong
government
loans
for
a
number
of
railroad
grants
but
the
bonapartist
is
to
enrich
itself
peculation
is
carried
on
with
railroad
concessions
on
the
bourse
by
the
initiated
but
no
capital
is
forthcoming
for
the
railroads
the
bank
then
pledges
itself
to
make
advances
upon
railroad
stock
but
the
bank
is
itself
to
be
exploited
hence
it
must
be
cajoled
it
is
released
of
the
obligation
to
publish
its
reports
weekly
then
follows
a
leonine
treaty
between
the
bank
and
the
government
the
people
are
to
be
occupied
public
works
are
ordered
but
the
public
works
raise
the
tax
rates
upon
the
people
thereupon
the
taxes
are
reduced
by
an
attack
upon
the
national
through
the
conversion
of
the
five
per
cent
rentes
the
name
of
the
french
national
bonds
into
yet
the
middle
class
must
again
be
tipped
to
this
end
the
tax
on
wine
is
doubled
for
the
people
who
buy
it
at
retail
and
is
reduced
to
for
the
middle
class
that
drink
it
at
wholesale
genuine
labor
organizations
are
dissolved
but
promises
are
made
of
future
wonders
to
accrue
from
organization
the
farmers
are
to
be
helped
are
set
up
that
must
promote
the
indebtedness
of
the
farmer
and
the
concentration
of
property
but
again
these
banks
are
to
be
utilized
especially
to
the
end
of
squeezing
money
out
of
the
confiscated
estates
of
the
house
of
orleans
no
capitalist
will
listen
to
this
scheme
which
moreover
is
not
mentioned
in
the
decree
the
mortgage
bank
remains
a
mere
decree
etc
bonaparte
would
like
to
appear
as
the
patriarchal
benefactor
of
all
classes
but
he
can
give
to
none
without
taking
from
the
others
as
was
said
of
the
duke
of
guise
at
the
time
of
the
fronde
that
he
was
the
most
obliging
man
in
france
because
he
had
converted
all
his
estates
into
bonds
upon
himself
for
his
parisians
so
would
napoleon
like
to
be
the
most
obliging
man
in
france
and
convert
all
property
and
all
labor
of
france
into
a
personal
bond
upon
himself
he
would
like
to
steal
the
whole
of
france
to
make
a
present
thereof
to
france
or
rather
to
be
able
to
purchase
france
back
again
with
french
money
as
chief
of
the
society
of
december
he
must
purchase
that
which
is
to
be
his
all
the
state
institutions
the
senate
the
council
of
state
the
legislature
the
legion
of
honor
the
soldiers
decorations
the
public
baths
the
public
buildings
the
railroads
the
general
staff
of
the
national
guard
exclusive
of
the
rank
and
file
the
confiscated
estates
of
the
house
of
orleans
all
are
converted
into
institutions
for
purchase
and
sale
every
place
in
the
army
and
the
machinery
of
government
becomes
a
purchasing
power
the
most
important
thing
however
in
this
process
whereby
france
is
taken
to
be
given
back
to
herself
are
the
percentages
that
in
the
transfer
drop
into
the
hands
of
the
chief
and
the
members
of
the
society
of
december
the
witticisms
with
which
the
countess
of
the
mistress
of
de
morny
characterized
the
confiscations
of
the
orleanist
estates
le
premier
vol
de
it
is
the
first
flight
of
the
eagle
the
french
word
vol
means
theft
as
well
as
flight
fits
every
fight
of
the
eagle
that
is
rather
a
crow
he
himself
and
his
followers
daily
call
out
to
themselves
like
the
italian
carthusian
monk
in
the
legend
does
to
the
miser
who
displayfully
counted
the
goods
on
which
he
could
live
for
many
years
to
come
tu
fai
conto
sopra
i
beni
bisogna
prima
far
il
conto
sopra
gli
anni
you
count
your
property
you
should
rather
count
the
years
left
to
you
in
order
not
to
make
a
mistake
in
the
years
they
count
by
minutes
a
crowd
of
fellows
of
the
best
among
whom
all
that
can
be
said
is
that
one
knows
not
whence
he
comes
a
noisy
restless
boheme
greedy
after
plunder
that
crawls
about
in
gallooned
frocks
with
the
same
grotesque
dignity
as
soulonque
soulonque
was
the
negro
emperor
of
the
negro
empire
of
hayti
imperial
dignitaries
thronged
the
court
crowded
the
ministries
and
pressed
upon
the
head
of
the
government
and
of
the
army
one
can
picture
to
himself
this
upper
crust
of
the
society
of
december
by
considering
that
veron
crevel
crevel
is
a
character
of
balzac
drawn
after
veron
the
proprietor
of
the
constitutional
newspaper
as
a
type
of
the
dissolute
parisian
philistine
is
their
preacher
of
morality
and
granier
de
cassagnac
their
thinker
when
guizot
at
the
time
he
was
minister
employed
this
granier
on
an
obscure
sheet
against
the
dynastic
opposition
he
used
to
praise
him
with
the
term
le
roi
des
droles
he
is
the
king
of
the
clowns
it
were
a
mistake
to
recall
the
days
of
the
regency
or
of
louis
xv
by
the
court
and
the
kit
of
louis
bonaparte
often
did
france
have
a
but
never
yet
an
administration
of
kept
men
madame
de
girardin
harassed
by
the
contradictory
demands
of
his
situation
and
compelled
like
a
performer
to
keep
by
means
of
constant
surprises
the
eyes
of
the
public
riveted
upon
himself
as
the
substitute
of
napoleon
compelled
consequently
everyday
to
accomplish
a
sort
of
coup
on
a
small
scale
bonaparte
throws
the
whole
bourgeois
social
system
into
disorder
he
broaches
everything
that
seemed
unbroachable
by
the
revolution
of
he
makes
one
set
people
patient
under
the
revolution
and
another
anxious
for
it
he
produces
anarchy
itself
in
the
name
of
order
by
rubbing
off
from
the
whole
machinery
of
government
the
veneer
of
sanctity
by
profaning
it
by
rendering
it
at
once
nauseating
and
laughable
he
rehearses
in
paris
the
cult
of
the
sacred
coat
of
trier
with
the
cult
of
the
napoleonic
imperial
mantle
but
when
the
imperial
mantle
shall
have
finally
fallen
upon
the
shoulders
of
louis
bonaparte
then
will
also
the
iron
statue
of
napoleon
drop
down
from
the
top
of
the
vendome
column
a
prophecy
that
a
few
years
later
after
bonaparte
coronation
as
emperor
was
literally
fulfilled
by
order
of
emperor
louis
napoleon
the
military
statue
of
the
napoleon
that
originally
surmounted
the
vendome
was
taken
down
and
replaced
by
one
of
first
napoleon
in
imperial
robes
