introducing
the
old
soak
illustration
our
friend
the
old
soak
came
in
from
his
home
in
flatbush
to
see
us
not
long
ago
in
anything
but
a
jovial
mood
i
see
that
some
persons
think
there
is
still
hope
for
a
liberal
interpretation
of
the
law
so
that
beer
and
light
wines
may
be
sold
said
we
hope
said
he
moodily
is
a
fine
thing
but
it
do
gurgle
none
when
you
pour
it
out
of
a
bottle
hope
is
all
right
and
so
is
faith
but
what
i
would
like
to
see
is
a
little
charity
as
far
as
hope
is
concerned
i
rather
have
despair
combined
with
a
case
of
bourbon
liquor
than
all
the
hope
in
the
world
by
itself
hope
is
what
these
here
fellows
has
got
that
is
tryin
to
make
their
own
with
a
and
a
piece
of
hose
that
awful
stuff
that
is
there
a
friend
of
mine
made
some
of
that
stuff
and
he
was
scared
of
it
and
he
thinks
before
he
drinks
any
he
will
try
some
of
it
onto
a
dumb
beast
but
there
ai
no
dumb
beast
anywheres
handy
so
he
feeds
some
of
it
to
his
wife
parrot
that
there
parrot
was
the
only
parrot
i
ever
knowed
of
that
was
named
polly
it
was
named
peter
and
was
supposed
to
be
a
gentleman
parrot
for
the
last
eight
or
ten
years
but
whether
it
was
or
not
after
it
drank
some
of
that
there
hootch
peter
went
and
laid
an
egg
that
there
stuff
ai
anything
to
trifle
with
it
like
amateur
theatricals
amateur
theatricals
is
all
right
for
an
occupation
for
them
that
has
got
anything
to
do
nor
nowhere
to
go
but
they
cause
useless
agony
to
an
audience
booze
may
be
all
right
to
take
the
grease
spots
out
of
the
rugs
with
but
it
ai
for
the
human
stomach
to
drink
booze
is
either
a
farce
with
no
serious
kick
to
it
or
else
a
tragedy
with
an
unhappy
ending
no
sir
as
soon
as
what
is
left
has
been
drank
i
will
kiss
to
the
shores
of
this
land
of
holiness
and
suffering
and
go
to
some
country
where
the
vegetation
just
naturally
works
itself
up
into
liquor
in
a
professional
manner
and
end
my
days
in
contentment
and
iniquity
unless
he
continued
with
a
faint
gleam
of
hope
the
smuggling
business
develops
into
what
it
ought
to
and
it
may
there
some
friends
of
mine
already
picked
out
a
likely
spot
on
the
shores
of
long
island
and
dug
a
hole
in
the
sand
that
kegs
might
wash
into
if
they
was
throwed
from
passing
vessels
they
hoisted
friendly
signals
but
so
far
nothing
has
been
throwed
he
had
a
little
of
the
right
sort
on
his
hip
and
after
refreshing
himself
he
announced
i
writing
a
diary
a
diary
of
the
past
a
kind
of
autobiography
of
what
me
and
old
king
booze
done
before
he
went
into
the
grave
and
took
one
of
my
feet
with
him
in
just
a
little
while
now
there
wo
be
any
one
in
this
here
broad
land
of
ours
speaking
of
it
geographically
that
knows
what
an
barroom
was
like
they
meet
up
with
the
word
future
generations
of
posterity
will
and
wonder
and
wonder
and
wonder
just
what
a
saloon
could
have
resembled
and
they
will
cudgel
their
brains
in
vain
as
the
poet
says
often
in
my
own
perusal
of
reading
matter
i
run
onto
institutions
that
i
would
like
to
know
more
of
but
no
one
ever
set
down
and
described
because
everyone
knowed
all
about
them
in
the
time
when
the
writing
was
done
often
i
thought
i
would
liked
to
knowed
all
about
them
hanging
gardens
of
babylon
for
instance
and
who
was
hanged
in
and
what
for
but
nobody
ever
described
as
fur
as
i
have
you
got
any
of
it
written
we
asked
him
here
the
start
of
it
said
he
we
present
it
just
as
the
old
soak
penned
it
chapter
two
beginning
the
old
soak
history
of
the
rum
demon
i
will
hereinunder
set
down
nothing
but
what
is
the
truth
the
whole
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
so
help
me
god
well
in
the
old
days
before
everybody
got
so
good
barrooms
was
so
frequent
that
nobody
thought
of
setting
down
their
scenery
and
habits
usually
you
went
into
it
by
a
pair
of
swinging
doors
that
met
in
the
middle
and
did
go
full
length
up
so
you
could
see
over
the
top
of
the
door
and
if
any
one
was
to
come
into
one
door
you
did
want
to
have
talk
with
or
anything
you
could
see
him
and
have
a
chance
to
gravitate
out
the
door
at
the
other
end
of
the
barroom
while
he
was
getting
in
but
you
could
see
into
the
windows
of
them
as
a
habitual
custom
because
who
could
tell
whether
a
customer
family
was
going
to
pass
by
and
glance
in
well
in
your
heart
you
knew
you
was
doing
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
but
all
families
even
in
the
good
old
days
contained
some
prohibition
relations
the
good
book
says
that
flies
in
the
ointment
send
forth
a
smell
to
heaven
well
you
felt
more
private
like
with
the
windows
fixed
thataway
they
was
painted
soaped
and
some
stained
glassed
it
had
its
good
sides
and
it
had
its
bad
sides
but
i
will
say
i
have
been
completely
out
of
touch
just
as
much
as
if
i
was
a
native
of
some
hot
country
with
all
kinds
of
morality
and
religions
of
all
sorts
ever
since
the
barrooms
was
shut
up
from
childhood
earliest
hours
religion
has
been
one
of
my
favourite
studies
and
i
never
let
a
week
pass
without
i
get
down
on
my
knees
some
time
or
another
and
pray
about
something
any
more
than
i
would
let
a
week
pass
without
i
washed
all
over
it
was
early
recollections
of
a
good
woman
that
kept
me
religious
and
i
hope
i
do
not
have
to
say
anything
further
to
this
gang
well
in
spite
of
my
religion
i
never
went
to
church
none
because
it
reasonable
to
suppose
that
a
man
could
keep
awake
he
thinks
what
if
i
should
nod
and
he
does
so
that
always
throwed
me
back
onto
the
barrooms
for
my
religion
well
then
the
first
thing
you
know
when
you
are
up
by
the
free
lunch
counter
eating
some
of
that
delicatessen
in
comes
a
girl
and
says
to
contribute
to
the
cause
well
what
cause
are
you
you
ask
her
well
she
says
salvation
army
or
the
volunteers
or
what
not
and
so
forth
as
the
case
may
be
or
maybe
she
was
boosting
for
some
of
these
new
religions
that
gets
out
a
paper
and
these
girls
go
around
and
sell
it
for
ten
cents
which
they
always
set
a
date
for
the
world
coming
to
an
end
well
then
you
got
a
line
on
her
religion
and
you
was
ashamed
not
to
give
her
a
quarter
for
you
had
spent
a
dollar
for
drinks
already
that
morning
and
then
all
through
the
day
there
was
other
religions
come
in
one
after
another
or
maybe
the
same
religion
over
and
over
again
well
then
you
kept
in
touch
with
religions
and
it
made
a
better
man
out
of
you
and
along
about
evening
time
when
you
figured
on
going
home
you
felt
like
it
would
be
right
to
tell
any
pervarications
to
your
wife
about
how
you
come
to
be
so
late
so
you
just
said
over
the
phone
i
am
starting
right
away
i
stopped
into
ed
place
to
play
a
game
of
pool
after
work
and
met
a
fellow
i
used
to
know
i
could
get
away
from
him
and
i
was
too
thoughtful
of
you
to
insist
for
him
to
come
home
to
dinner
so
he
insisted
i
ought
to
have
a
drink
with
him
for
old
time
and
if
it
had
been
for
being
in
contact
with
different
religions
all
day
you
would
of
lied
outright
to
your
wife
and
felt
mean
as
a
dog
about
it
when
she
found
you
out
well
then
it
needs
no
further
proof
that
the
abolishment
of
the
saloon
has
taken
away
the
common
people
religions
from
them
but
it
is
my
message
to
tell
just
what
the
barrooms
was
like
and
not
to
criticize
the
laws
of
the
land
even
when
they
are
as
so
many
of
them
are
so
i
will
confine
myself
to
describing
the
barroom
and
the
rum
demon
well
i
never
saw
much
rum
drunk
in
the
places
where
i
hung
out
sometimes
some
baccardy
into
a
cocktail
but
for
my
part
cocktails
always
struck
me
as
wicked
the
good
book
says
that
the
lord
started
the
people
right
but
that
men
had
made
many
adventures
well
then
i
took
mine
straight
for
the
most
part
except
when
i
needed
some
special
kind
of
a
in
the
morning
and
the
good
book
says
not
to
tarry
long
over
the
wine
cup
and
i
never
done
that
neither
except
a
little
rhine
wine
in
the
summer
time
but
mostly
took
mine
straight
well
then
to
come
down
to
describing
these
phantom
places
over
which
the
raven
says
nevermore
but
the
posterity
of
the
future
may
wish
to
have
its
own
say
so
about
well
there
was
a
long
counter
always
kept
wiped
off
not
like
these
here
sticky
counters
which
the
boys
and
girls
back
of
them
always
look
sticky
too
and
their
sleeves
look
sticky
and
the
glasses
is
sticky
but
in
a
decent
barroom
the
counter
was
kept
swiped
off
clean
and
selfrespectable
and
there
was
a
brass
rail
with
cuspidors
near
to
it
if
you
wanted
to
cuspidate
it
was
handy
right
there
and
there
no
place
to
hawk
and
cuspidate
in
these
here
dives
not
that
i
ever
been
in
them
much
all
that
stuff
rots
the
lining
of
your
stomach
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
being
the
posterity
of
a
lot
of
scotch
ancestors
i
never
liked
soft
stuff
in
my
insides
i
never
drunk
nothing
but
whiskey
for
comfort
and
pleasure
and
i
never
took
no
medicine
in
my
life
except
calomel
and
i
always
held
to
the
presbyterian
religion
as
my
favourite
religion
because
those
three
things
has
got
some
kick
when
took
inside
of
you
well
then
to
get
down
to
telling
just
what
these
places
was
like
it
would
surprise
this
generation
of
posterity
how
genteel
some
of
them
was
which
i
will
come
down
to
in
my
next
chapter
well
i
will
close
this
chapter
chapter
three
liquor
and
hennery
simms
illustration
i
never
could
see
liquor
drinking
as
a
bad
habit
said
the
old
soak
though
i
admit
fair
and
free
it
will
lead
to
bad
habits
if
it
watched
in
these
here
remarks
of
mine
i
aim
to
tell
the
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
so
help
me
jehorsophat
as
the
good
book
says
one
feller
i
knowed
whose
liquor
drinking
led
to
bad
habits
was
my
old
friend
hennery
simms
every
time
hennery
got
anyways
jingled
he
used
to
fall
downstairs
and
he
fell
down
so
often
that
it
got
to
be
a
habit
and
you
could
call
it
nothing
else
he
thought
he
had
to
one
time
late
at
night
i
was
going
over
to
brooklyn
on
the
subway
and
i
seen
one
of
these
here
escalators
with
hennery
onto
it
moving
upwards
only
hennery
was
riding
on
his
feet
he
was
riding
on
the
spine
of
his
back
and
when
he
got
to
the
top
of
the
thing
and
it
skated
him
out
onto
the
level
what
does
hennery
do
but
pitch
himself
onto
it
again
head
first
and
again
he
was
carried
up
after
i
seen
him
do
that
three
or
four
times
i
rode
up
to
where
hennery
was
floundering
at
and
i
ast
him
what
was
he
doing
falling
downstairs
says
hennery
you
doing
that
fur
i
says
drunk
ai
i
says
hennery
old
fool
you
knows
i
always
falls
downstairs
when
i
drunk
many
times
you
goin
to
fall
down
these
here
stairs
i
ast
him
ai
fell
down
these
here
stairs
once
yet
says
hennery
i
must
of
tried
to
a
dozen
times
i
been
tryin
to
fall
down
these
here
stairs
ever
since
dusk
set
in
but
they
something
wrong
about
i
did
know
i
was
drunk
i
would
swear
these
here
stairs
was
movin
they
be
movin
i
tells
him
go
about
your
business
he
says
do
mock
a
man
doing
the
best
he
can
in
course
they
ai
movin
only
looks
like
they
was
movin
to
me
because
i
drunk
you
ca
fool
me
and
i
left
him
still
tryin
to
fall
down
them
stairs
and
still
carried
up
again
which
as
i
remarked
at
first
only
goes
to
show
that
drink
will
lead
to
habits
if
it
ai
watched
even
when
it
ai
a
habit
do
you
have
any
more
of
your
history
of
the
rum
demon
written
we
asked
him
said
he
and
left
us
the
second
installment
chapter
four
the
old
soak
history
the
barroom
as
an
educative
influence
well
as
i
said
in
my
first
installment
some
them
barrooms
was
such
genteel
places
they
would
surprise
you
if
you
had
got
the
idea
that
they
was
all
gems
of
iniquity
and
wickedness
with
the
bartenders
mostly
in
clean
collars
and
their
hair
slicked
not
like
so
many
of
these
places
where
the
hair
is
stringy
well
this
is
for
future
generations
of
posterity
that
will
have
never
saw
a
saloon
and
the
whole
truth
is
to
be
set
down
so
help
me
god
and
i
will
say
that
it
took
a
good
deal
of
sweeping
sometimes
to
keep
the
floor
clean
and
often
the
free
lunch
was
approached
with
one
fork
for
several
people
especially
the
beans
well
it
has
been
three
or
four
years
even
before
that
eighteenth
commandment
passed
since
free
lunch
was
what
it
once
was
and
some
barrooms
was
under
par
but
i
am
speaking
of
the
average
good
class
barroom
where
you
would
take
your
own
children
or
grandchildren
as
the
case
may
be
they
was
some
very
places
among
them
where
if
a
man
had
spent
all
his
money
already
for
his
own
good
they
would
refuse
to
let
him
have
anything
more
to
drink
until
maybe
someone
set
them
up
for
him
but
to
get
down
to
brass
tacks
and
describe
what
they
looked
like
more
thoroughly
i
will
say
they
was
always
attractive
to
me
with
those
long
expensive
mirrors
and
brass
fixtures
like
a
scene
of
elegance
and
grandeur
out
of
the
old
testament
where
it
tells
of
solomon
in
all
his
glory
and
if
a
gent
would
forget
to
be
genteel
after
he
took
too
much
and
his
money
was
all
spent
and
imbue
himself
with
loud
talk
or
rough
language
and
maybe
want
to
hit
somebody
and
there
was
none
of
his
friends
there
to
take
charge
of
him
often
i
have
seen
such
throwed
out
on
their
ear
for
the
better
class
places
always
aimed
to
be
decent
and
orderly
and
never
to
have
an
indecent
reputation
for
loudness
and
roughhouseness
well
i
will
say
i
have
not
kept
up
with
politics
like
i
used
to
since
the
barrooms
was
vanished
my
eyes
ai
what
they
used
to
be
and
the
newspapers
are
different
from
each
other
so
who
can
tell
what
to
believe
but
in
the
old
days
you
could
keep
in
touch
with
politics
in
the
barrooms
it
made
a
better
citizen
out
of
you
for
every
man
ought
to
vote
for
what
his
consciousness
tells
him
is
right
and
to
abide
in
politics
by
his
consciousness
well
closing
the
barroom
has
shut
off
my
chance
to
be
imbued
with
political
dope
and
who
to
bet
on
in
the
next
election
and
i
am
not
so
good
a
citizen
as
before
the
saloons
was
closed
i
would
not
know
who
to
bet
on
in
any
election
but
i
used
to
get
straight
tips
and
in
that
way
took
an
interest
in
politics
which
a
man
is
scarcely
to
be
called
an
american
citizen
unless
he
does
well
i
see
everywhere
where
all
the
doctors
and
science
sharks
says
to
keep
in
touch
with
outdoor
sports
if
you
want
to
keep
young
i
used
to
know
all
about
all
those
outdoor
sports
and
who
the
giants
had
bought
and
what
they
paid
for
him
and
who
was
the
best
pitcher
and
what
the
dope
was
on
tomorrow
entries
at
havana
but
all
that
is
taken
away
from
me
now
the
saloons
is
closed
and
i
got
no
chance
to
get
into
touch
with
outdoor
sports
and
i
feel
it
in
my
health
some
of
these
days
the
prohibition
aliments
will
wake
up
and
see
they
have
ruined
the
country
but
then
it
will
be
too
late
taking
the
sports
away
from
a
nation
is
not
going
to
do
it
any
good
when
the
next
war
comes
along
if
one
does
well
i
promised
i
would
describe
more
what
they
looked
like
i
will
tackle
that
in
the
next
chapter
so
i
will
bring
this
installment
to
a
close
chapter
five
look
out
for
crime
waves
illustration
they
going
to
take
our
tobacco
next
are
they
said
the
old
soak
well
me
i
wo
struggle
none
i
ai
fit
to
struggle
i
licked
my
heart
broke
they
can
come
and
take
my
blood
if
they
want
it
and
all
i
do
is
ask
whether
they
have
it
a
drop
at
a
time
or
the
whole
concerns
in
a
bucket
all
i
say
is
out
for
crime
waves
i
do
threaten
nobody
i
just
predict
if
you
ever
waked
up
about
in
the
morning
two
or
three
miles
from
a
store
and
that
store
likely
closed
and
no
neighbour
near
by
and
the
snow
drifting
the
roads
shut
and
wanted
a
smoke
and
there
was
a
single
crumb
of
tobacco
nowheres
in
the
house
you
know
what
i
mean
you
go
and
look
for
old
cigar
and
cigarette
butts
to
crumble
into
your
pipe
and
there
ai
none
you
go
through
all
your
clothes
for
little
mites
of
tobacco
that
have
maybe
jolted
into
your
pockets
and
there
ai
none
your
summer
clothes
is
packed
away
into
the
bottom
of
a
trunk
somewheres
and
you
wake
your
wife
to
find
the
key
to
the
trunk
and
you
get
the
clothes
and
there
ai
no
tobacco
in
them
pockets
either
and
then
you
and
your
wife
has
words
and
you
sit
and
suffer
and
cuss
and
chew
the
stem
of
your
empty
pipe
by
in
the
morning
there
no
customary
crime
known
you
would
commit
by
you
begin
to
think
of
new
crimes
and
how
you
like
to
commit
them
and
then
make
up
comic
songs
about
and
go
and
sing
them
songs
at
the
funerals
of
them
you
slew
hark
to
me
if
tobacco
goes
next
there
be
a
crime
wave
take
away
a
man
booze
and
he
dies
or
embraces
dope
or
religion
or
goes
abroad
or
makes
it
at
home
or
drinks
varnish
or
gets
philosophical
or
something
but
tobacco
no
sir
there
ai
any
substitute
why
the
only
way
they
getting
away
with
this
booze
thing
now
is
because
millions
and
millions
of
shattered
nerves
is
solacing
and
soothing
theirselves
with
tobacco
i
mild
myself
i
wo
explode
i
getting
my
booze
i
know
where
there
plenty
of
it
my
heart
broke
to
see
the
saloons
closed
and
i
licked
by
the
overwhelming
righteous
but
i
wo
suffer
any
personal
for
a
long
time
yet
but
there
them
that
will
and
on
top
of
everything
else
tobacco
is
to
go
all
right
take
it
but
i
say
solemn
and
warningly
out
for
crime
waves
the
godly
and
the
righteous
can
push
us
wicked
persons
just
so
far
but
worms
will
turn
look
at
the
garden
of
eden
the
mammal
of
iniquity
ai
never
yet
been
completely
abolished
look
at
the
history
of
the
world
every
once
in
a
while
it
has
always
looked
as
if
the
pious
and
the
uplifter
was
going
to
bring
in
the
millennium
with
bells
on
it
but
something
has
always
happened
just
in
time
and
the
mammal
of
unrighteousness
has
come
into
his
own
again
i
ai
threatening
i
just
predict
out
for
crime
waves
as
for
me
i
may
never
see
satan
come
back
home
i
old
i
ai
long
for
this
weary
land
of
purity
and
this
vale
of
tears
and
virtue
soon
be
in
a
place
where
the
godly
cease
from
troubling
and
the
wicked
are
at
rest
but
i
got
children
and
grandchildren
that
fight
against
the
millennium
to
the
last
gasp
if
i
know
the
breed
and
i
going
to
pass
on
full
of
hope
and
trust
and
calm
belief
here
concluded
the
old
soak
unscrewing
the
top
of
his
pocket
flask
here
is
to
the
mammal
of
unrighteousness
he
deposited
on
our
desk
the
next
installment
of
his
history
chapter
six
continuing
the
old
soak
history
the
barroom
and
the
arts
well
i
promised
to
describe
what
the
saloon
that
has
been
banished
was
like
so
that
future
generations
of
posterity
will
know
what
it
was
like
they
never
having
seen
one
and
maybe
being
curious
which
i
would
give
a
good
deal
to
know
how
they
got
all
their
animals
into
the
ark
only
nobody
that
was
on
the
spot
thought
to
write
it
down
and
figure
the
room
for
the
stalls
and
cages
and
when
it
comes
to
that
how
did
they
train
animals
to
talk
in
those
days
like
balaam
and
his
ass
and
moses
knocking
the
water
out
of
the
rocks
always
interested
me
which
i
will
tell
the
truth
so
help
me
it
used
to
be
this
way
some
had
tables
and
some
did
not
but
i
never
was
much
of
a
one
for
tables
for
if
you
set
down
your
legs
do
tell
you
anything
about
how
you
are
standing
it
till
you
get
up
and
find
you
have
went
further
than
you
intended
but
if
you
stand
up
your
legs
gives
you
a
warning
from
time
to
time
you
better
not
have
but
one
more
well
i
will
tell
the
truth
and
one
thing
is
the
treating
habit
was
a
great
evil
they
would
come
too
fast
and
you
would
take
a
light
drink
like
rhine
wine
whilst
they
was
coming
too
fast
and
that
way
use
up
considerable
room
that
you
could
of
had
more
advantage
from
if
you
had
saved
it
for
something
important
well
the
good
book
says
to
beware
of
wine
and
evil
communications
corrupts
a
good
many
well
what
i
always
wanted
was
that
warm
feeling
that
started
about
the
equator
and
spread
gentle
all
over
you
till
you
loved
your
neighbour
as
the
good
book
says
and
wine
never
had
the
efficiency
for
me
well
i
will
say
even
if
the
treating
habit
was
a
great
evil
it
is
an
ill
wind
that
blows
nobody
any
good
well
i
promised
to
come
down
to
brass
tacks
and
describe
what
the
barroom
looked
like
some
of
the
old
timers
had
sawdust
on
the
floor
which
i
never
cared
much
for
that
as
it
never
looked
genteel
to
me
and
almost
anything
might
be
mixed
into
it
i
will
tell
the
whole
truth
so
help
me
and
another
kick
i
got
is
about
business
advantages
which
you
used
to
be
lined
up
by
the
bar
five
or
six
of
you
and
suppose
you
was
in
the
real
estate
business
or
something
a
fellow
would
say
he
had
an
idea
that
such
and
such
a
section
would
be
going
to
have
a
boom
and
that
started
you
figuring
on
it
well
i
missed
a
lot
of
business
opportunities
like
that
since
the
barroom
has
been
vanished
what
can
a
country
expect
if
it
destroys
all
chances
a
man
has
got
to
get
ahead
in
business
the
next
time
they
ask
us
for
business
as
usual
to
win
a
war
with
this
country
will
find
out
something
about
closing
up
all
chances
a
man
has
to
get
tips
on
their
business
chances
well
the
good
book
says
to
laugh
and
grow
fat
and
since
the
barroom
has
been
taken
away
what
chance
you
got
to
hear
any
new
stories
i
would
like
to
know
well
so
help
me
i
said
i
would
tell
the
truth
and
the
truth
is
some
of
them
stories
was
not
fit
to
offer
up
along
with
your
prayers
but
at
the
same
time
you
got
acquainted
with
some
right
fellows
well
what
i
want
to
know
is
how
could
you
blame
a
country
for
turning
into
bolshevisitors
if
all
chance
for
sociability
is
shut
off
by
the
government
from
the
plain
people
well
the
better
class
of
them
had
pictures
on
the
walls
and
since
they
been
taken
away
what
chance
has
a
busy
man
like
me
got
to
go
to
a
museum
and
see
all
them
works
of
art
hand
painted
by
artists
and
looking
as
slick
and
shiny
as
one
of
these
here
circus
lithographs
well
a
country
wants
to
look
out
what
it
is
doing
when
it
shuts
off
from
the
plain
people
all
the
chance
to
educate
itself
in
the
high
arts
and
hand
painting
some
of
the
frames
by
themselves
must
of
been
worth
a
good
deal
of
money
the
good
book
says
you
shalt
not
live
by
bread
alone
and
if
you
got
a
chance
to
educate
your
self
in
the
high
arts
or
nothing
after
a
while
this
country
will
get
to
the
place
where
all
the
foreign
countries
will
laugh
at
us
for
we
wo
know
good
hand
painting
when
we
see
it
well
they
was
a
story
to
all
them
hand
paintings
and
often
when
business
was
slack
i
used
to
talk
with
ed
the
bartender
about
them
paintings
and
what
did
he
suppose
they
was
about
what
chance
have
i
got
to
go
and
buy
a
box
to
set
in
every
night
at
the
metropolitan
opera
house
i
would
like
to
know
and
hear
singing
well
the
good
book
says
not
to
have
anything
to
do
with
a
man
that
ai
got
any
music
in
his
soul
and
the
right
kind
of
a
crowd
in
the
right
kind
of
a
barroom
could
all
get
to
singing
together
and
furnish
me
with
music
a
government
that
takes
away
all
its
music
like
that
from
the
plain
people
had
better
watch
out
some
of
these
days
there
will
be
another
big
war
and
what
will
they
do
without
music
i
always
been
fond
of
music
and
there
ai
anywhere
i
can
go
that
it
sounds
the
same
sort
of
warmed
up
and
friendly
and
careless
let
alone
taking
away
my
chance
to
meet
up
with
different
religions
taking
away
my
music
has
been
a
big
blow
to
me
well
i
will
tell
the
truth
so
help
me
it
was
a
nice
place
to
drop
into
on
a
rainy
day
you
do
want
to
be
setting
down
at
home
on
a
rainy
day
reading
your
bible
all
the
time
but
since
they
been
closed
i
had
to
do
a
lot
of
reading
to
get
through
the
day
somehow
and
the
wife
is
too
busy
to
talk
to
me
and
the
rest
of
the
family
is
at
work
or
somewheres
well
another
evil
is
i
been
doing
too
much
reading
and
that
will
rot
out
your
brains
unless
of
course
it
is
the
good
book
and
you
get
kind
of
mixed
up
with
all
them
revelations
and
things
and
you
get
tired
figuring
out
almanacs
and
the
book
with
drummer
jokes
in
it
do
sound
so
good
in
print
as
when
a
fellow
tells
them
to
you
and
i
never
was
much
of
a
one
for
novels
what
i
like
is
books
about
something
you
could
maybe
know
about
yourself
and
maybe
some
of
them
wonders
of
the
world
with
explanations
of
how
they
was
made
but
nobody
that
was
on
the
spot
took
the
trouble
to
explain
a
lot
of
them
things
which
is
why
i
am
setting
down
what
the
barroom
was
like
so
help
me
well
in
the
next
chapter
i
will
describe
it
some
more
or
future
generations
will
have
no
notion
of
them
without
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
changes
its
mind
and
comes
to
its
census
again
chapter
seven
an
argument
with
the
old
woman
illustration
the
old
woman
and
me
had
quite
an
argument
last
sunday
said
the
old
soak
it
ended
up
with
her
turning
a
saucepan
full
of
hot
peas
onto
my
bald
spot
which
ai
no
way
to
treat
garden
truck
with
the
cost
of
things
what
they
be
but
i
won
one
of
these
here
moral
victories
even
if
she
did
get
the
best
of
me
and
chase
me
out
of
the
house
it
all
come
about
over
some
pie
we
had
for
dinner
on
sunday
it
looked
like
mince
pie
to
me
when
she
set
it
on
the
table
and
i
says
to
her
why
do
she
make
some
rhubarb
pie
or
apple
pie
or
something
for
this
is
a
hell
of
a
time
of
year
to
be
having
mince
pie
and
mince
pie
ai
no
good
anyhow
unless
you
put
a
shot
of
brandy
or
hard
cider
into
it
she
knows
i
orter
be
careful
what
i
put
into
my
stomach
which
is
all
to
the
bad
since
i
ca
get
the
right
kind
of
drink
any
more
and
i
told
her
so
then
says
she
ai
mince
pie
this
is
raisin
pie
pie
i
says
and
i
was
shocked
and
scandalized
pie
good
lord
woman
are
you
crazy
you
do
mean
to
say
you
went
and
took
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
good
raisins
and
went
and
wasted
them
thataway
by
puttin
in
a
it
the
most
extravagant
thing
i
ever
hearn
tell
on
ai
you
got
sense
enough
to
know
that
in
these
days
raisins
ai
something
you
eat
well
what
are
they
then
she
says
raisins
i
told
her
something
you
make
hootch
out
of
and
you
know
i
reduced
to
makin
my
own
stuff
these
days
and
yet
here
you
be
puttin
at
least
a
quart
of
good
raisins
into
a
pie
well
one
word
led
to
another
and
as
i
said
she
hit
me
with
the
peas
but
i
got
away
with
that
pie
i
won
the
moral
victory
i
got
that
pie
fermentin
now
in
the
bottom
of
a
cask
full
of
grape
and
berry
juice
and
other
truck
i
picked
up
here
and
there
no
sir
there
goin
to
be
no
raisins
wasted
around
my
house
by
eatin
of
in
this
here
time
of
need
the
old
soak
was
silent
a
moment
and
then
he
said
this
here
installment
of
my
diary
of
booze
takes
up
that
very
point
of
with
the
old
chapter
eight
the
old
soak
history
more
evils
of
prohibition
well
another
kick
i
got
on
the
abvolition
of
the
barroom
is
the
fact
that
you
got
to
stay
around
home
so
much
and
that
naturally
leads
to
having
a
row
with
your
wife
when
there
was
barrooms
my
wife
used
to
jaw
me
every
time
i
come
home
anyways
lit
up
and
i
just
let
her
jaw
me
and
there
was
any
row
for
i
figured
better
let
her
get
away
with
it
who
knows
maybe
she
thinks
she
is
right
about
it
but
now
i
stick
around
home
a
good
deal
of
the
time
and
it
leads
to
words
well
she
says
to
me
why
do
you
go
and
get
a
job
of
work
of

thinking
up
this
big
business

what
kind
of
a
business
deal

you
thinking
up

is
an
invention
i
says
to
her
and

because
i
have
stood
for
you
intrupting
me
for
forty
years

am
going
to
stand
for
it
forty
years
more

time
she
says
and
good
riddance
the
children
will
keep
me
and
there
will
be
one
less
to
cook
for
besides
being
ashamed
of
you
before
all
my
own
friends
and
the
nice
people
the
children
know
well
i
said
here
i
set
turning
over
the
leaves
of
the
bible
and
you
attack
me
that
way
and
me
trying
to
think
up
a
business
deal
to
buy
you
an
automobile
and
the
pappitation
in
my
heart
that
bad
it
shakes
the
chair
i
am
setting
in
and
if
a
man
with
one
foot
in
the
grave
ca
get
any
peace
and
quiet
to
read
his
bible
in
his
own
home
against
the
time
he
is
going
to
cash
in
then
i
will
say
that
prohibition
has
brought
this
country
to
a
pretty
pass
well
she
says
what
is
that
pappitation
from
but
all
the
liquor
you
drunk
it
is
from
my
constitution
i
says
as
the
doctor
will
tell
you
if
it
had
been
for
a
little
mite
of
stimulant
now
and
then
i
would
of
cashed
in
long
ago
and
you
would
now
have
the
life
insurance
money
well
she
says
what
kind
of
an
invention
is
this
you
claim
you
are
thinking
up
all
the
time
yes
i
says
i
would
see
myself
telling
you
would
i
and
you
blabbing
it
the
next
time
a
lot
of
them
church
women
meets
at
our
house
and
some
old
church
deacon
getting
hold
of
it
and
getting
rich
off
of
it
and
me
wandering
the
streets
in
destitution
with
the
rain
running
down
often
my
beard
and
the
end
of
my
nose
because
you
and
the
children
cast
me
into
the
street
well
she
says
where
is
that
thousand
dollars
that
my
uncle
lemuel
willed
to
me
and
i
give
it
to
you
for
one
of
them
inventions
nearly
thirty
years
ago
and
never
seen
hide
nor
hair
on
it
since
then
well
i
says
that
thousand
dollars
is
gone
and
it
went
the
same
way
as
that
money
i
loaned
to
your
cousin
dan
when
he
failed
in
business
and
would
of
starved
to
death
him
and
his
family
if
i
had
come
across
with
the
cash
that
is
where
that
thousand
dollars
is
well
that
the
way
it
goes
until
i
get
tired
of
trying
to
make
her
see
any
sense
and
sneak
out
to
where
my
stuff
is
hid
and
fill
me
a
pint
bottle
for
my
hip
pocket
and
go
and
find
a
friend
somewheres
and
in
just
that
way
prohibition
is
breaking
up
millions
and
millions
of
homes
every
day
chapter
nine
preparing
for
christmas
illustration
christmas
said
the
old
soak
will
soon
be
here
but
me
i
going
to
look
at
it
i
ai
got
the
heart
to
face
it
i
going
to
crawl
off
and
make
arrangements
to
go
to
sleep
on
the
of
december
and
not
wake
up
until
the
second
of
january
them
that
is
in
favour
of
a
denaturized
christmas
wo
be
interfered
with
by
me
i
got
no
grudge
against
them
but
i
wo
intrude
any
on
them
either
they
can
pass
through
the
holidays
in
an
orgy
of
sobriety
and
i
be
all
alone
in
my
own
little
room
with
my
memories
and
a
case
of
bourbon
to
bear
me
up
i
never
could
look
on
christmas
with
the
naked
eye
it
makes
me
so
darned
sad
christmas
does
there
the
kids
i
used
to
give
presents
and
my
tendency
was
to
weep
as
i
give
them
little
rascals
i
said
to
myself
think
life
is
going
to
be
just
one
christmas
tree
after
another
but
it
ai
and
then
i
think
of
all
the
christmases
past
i
had
spent
with
good
friends
and
how
they
was
all
gone
or
on
their
way
and
i
think
of
all
the
poor
folks
on
christmas
and
how
the
efforts
made
for
them
at
that
season
was
only
a
drop
in
the
bucket
to
what
they
need
the
year
around
and
along
about
december
i
always
got
so
downhearted
and
sentimental
and
discouraged
about
the
whole
darned
universe
i
nearly
died
with
melancholy
in
years
past
the
remedy
was
at
hand
a
few
drinks
and
i
could
look
even
christmas
in
the
face
a
few
more
and
i
stand
under
the
mistletoe
and
sing
rest
ye
merry
gentlemen
and
by
the
night
of
christmas
day
i
had
kidded
myself
into
thinking
i
liked
it
and
wanted
to
keep
it
up
for
a
week
but
this
christmas
there
ai
going
to
be
any
general
iniquity
used
to
season
the
grand
religious
festival
with
except
among
a
few
of
us
old
soaks
that
has
it
laid
away
i
ai
got
the
heart
to
look
on
all
the
melancholy
critters
that
will
be
remembering
the
drinks
they
had
last
year
and
i
ai
going
to
trot
my
own
feelings
out
and
make
public
neither
no
sir
me
i
going
to
hibernate
like
a
bear
that
goes
to
sleep
with
his
thumb
in
his
mouth
only
it
wo
be
a
thumb
i
have
in
my
mouth
my
house
will
be
full
of
children
and
grandchildren
and
there
will
be
a
passel
of
my
wife
relations
that
has
always
boosted
for
prohibition
but
any
of
ai
going
to
see
the
old
man
i
mingle
in
any
of
them
debilitated
festivities
i
ai
any
old
scrooge
but
i
respect
the
memory
of
the
christmas
and
i
going
to
have
mine
all
by
myself
the
melancholy
part
of
it
that
comes
first
and
the
cure
for
the
melancholy
this
country
ai
worthy
to
share
in
my
kind
of
a
christmas
and
i
ai
so
much
as
going
to
stick
my
head
out
of
the
window
and
let
it
smell
my
breath
till
after
the
holidays
is
over
i
got
presents
for
all
of
but
none
of
is
to
be
allowed
to
open
the
old
man
door
and
poke
any
presents
into
his
room
for
him
they
ai
worthy
to
give
me
presents
the
people
in
general
in
this
country
ai
and
i
wo
take
none
from
them
they
might
got
together
and
stopped
this
prohibition
thing
before
it
got
such
a
start
but
they
did
have
the
gumption
i
seceded
i
have
and
if
any
of
my
wife
prohibition
relations
comes
sniffin
and
smellin
around
my
door
where
i
locked
myself
in
i
put
a
bullet
through
the
door
you
hear
me
and
i
know
who
sniffin
too
for
i
can
tell
a
prohibitionist
sniff
as
fur
as
i
can
hear
it
i
got
a
bar
of
my
own
all
fixed
up
in
my
bedroom
and
there
going
to
be
a
hot
water
kettle
near
by
it
and
a
bowl
of
this
here
tom
and
jerry
setting
onto
it
as
big
as
life
and
every
time
i
wake
up
i
crawl
out
of
bed
and
say
to
myself

one
more
now
myself
will
say
to
me

really
had
orter
have
that
one
i
had
so
many
but
just
one

and
then
we
mix
it
right
solemn
and
pour
in
the
hot
water
standing
there
in
front
of
the
bar
with
our
foot
onto
the
railing
me
and
myself
together
and
myself
will
say
to
me

right
like

appurtenances
of

sing
through
your
digestive
ornaments
like
a
christmas
carol

one
ed
and
then
i
skip
around
behind
the
bar
and
play
i
was
ed
the
bartender
and
say
they
too
sweet
for
you
sir
and
then
i
play
i
was
myself
again
and
say
they
ai
ed
they
just
right
ask
that
feller
down
by
the
end
of
the
bar
ed
to
join
us
i
know
him
but
i
forget
his
name
and
then
i
play
i
was
the
feller
and
say
i
had
orter
have
another
but
i
will
for
it
always
fair
weather
when
good
fellows
gets
together
and
then
me
and
myself
and
that
other
feller

each
one
of
us
wants
to
buy
one
and
then
ed
the
bartender
will
say
to
have

on

house
and
then
i
go
to
sleep
again
and
hibernate
some
more
and
do
you
call
me
out
of
that
there
room
till
along
about
noon
on
the
second
day
of
january
i
be
alone
in
there
with
my
joy
and
my
grief
and
all
them
chapter
ten
continuing
the
history
the
old
soak
fears
for
the
growing
children
another
thing
wrong
with
prohibition
that
will
one
day
make
them
sorry
they
passed
that
commandment
onto
the
constitution
is
the
way
it
will
bring
liquor
in
front
of
the
growing
children
and
if
the
children
learns
to
drink
it
too
young
what
will
become
of
this
country
i
would
like
to
know
when
the
next
war
comes
along
i
guess
they
did
think
of
that
all
these
here
wise
johnnies
when
they
passed
that
law
when
you
used
to
get
all
you
wanted
in
a
barroom
you
went
there
for
it
and
the
children
did
see
you
and
they
could
go
into
them
places
and
it
was
sticking
around
under
the
children
noses
at
home
all
the
time
making
them
ask
pa
what
do
you
need
with
so
much
of
that
medicine
and
can
i
have
some
pa
but
now
you
have
it
at
home
and
it
is
sticking
under
their
noses
all
the
time
and
the
chances
are
millions
and
millions
of
children
will
learn
to
drink
too
soon
just
because
it
is
sticking
under
their
noses
all
the
time
and
that
is
what
prohibition
is
doing
for
this
country
for
everyone
knows
if
they
drink
it
too
soon
it
will
stunt
their
growths
it
is
a
great
responsibility
to
bring
up
children
right
and
godfearing
and
be
sure
they
say
their
lay
me
down
to
sleep
every
night
like
the
good
book
says
they
should
and
what
i
want
to
know
is
why
this
government
do
help
the
parents
and
fathers
with
all
them
responsibilities
instead
of
being
a
stumbling
block
in
their
way
and
putting
liquor
in
the
home
where
the
growing
children
will
smell
it
all
the
time
and
if
they
smell
it
they
will
want
some
of
it
of
course
a
young
feller
has
got
to
learn
to
drink
some
time
but
there
is
such
a
thing
as
learning
too
young
and
it
stunts
their
growth
and
the
good
book
says
keep
it
out
of
the
mouths
of
babes
and
sucklings
maybe
a
little
beer
is
all
right
if
a
baby
is
puny
to
fatten
him
up
but
i
never
give
my
children
any
hard
liquor
till
they
had
their
growth
and
i
got
no
use
for
a
government
that
turns
in
and
puts
liquor
in
the
home
to
make
drunkards
out
of
the
little
innocent
children
maybe
if
a
child
has
got
a
cold
a
little
whiskey
is
good
for
him
and
what
is
left
in
the
bottom
of
the
glass
when
their
dad
is
done
with
it
if
they
put
some
sugar
and
water
in
it
and
play
they
are
like
pa
hurt
none
of
them
any
and
will
help
make
them
so
they
can
hold
their
share
when
they
get
growed
up
but
that
is
different
from
forcing
it
down
their
poor
little
innocent
throats
all
the
time
and
every
day
which
is
what
that
prohibition
commandment
amounts
to
i
knowed
a
child
once
in
a
fambly
where
they
thought
it
was
smart
to
let
him
have
some
hard
liquor
and
he
growed
up
with
goggle
eyes
and
all
rickety
from
it
and
took
to
smoking
these
here
cheap
cigarettes
and
it
was
a
shame
as
any
person
with
any
heart
a
tall
would
have
said
and
does
this
government
want
the
whole
future
generation
of
posterity
to
grow
up
goggle
eyed
and
rickety
like
that
by
forcing
liquor
into
the
home
and
where
will
they
get
their
strong
soldiers
from
in
the
next
war
i
will
say
they
got
no
conscience
to
do
a
thing
like
that
to
the
whole
passel
of
children
waiting
to
grow
up
and
go
to
be
soldiers
it
is
enough
to
make
any
honest
man
stop
and
think
and
his
heart
bleed
when
he
thinks
of
all
them
millions
and
millions
of
innocent
children
and
the
way
they
are
being
ruined
with
liquor
in
the
home
and
maybe
helping
their
daddies
make
it
with
yeast
and
raisins
and
things
and
cornmeal
in
the
cellar
i
teached
my
boys
to
drink
in
the
barroom
just
as
fast
as
they
growed
up
and
teached
them
to
tell
good
liquor
from
bad
liquor
and
not
to
mix
their
drinks
and
not
to
go
in
for
fancy
drinks
and
to
drink
along
with
me
for
a
comfort
for
my
old
age
and
a
father
had
ought
to
make
chums
of
his
boys
like
that
and
give
them
the
right
example
and
they
stay
close
to
him
and
he
knows
what
they
are
thinking
about
and
can
give
them
good
advice
and
my
boys
has
been
a
comfort
to
me
my
boys
is
all
growed
up
but
what
worries
me
is
the
millions
and
millions
of
little
children
that
is
going
to
learn
to
drink
too
young
well
in
my
next
chapter
i
promise
to
get
down
to
brass
tacks
and
tell
just
exactly
what
those
barrooms
was
like
that
has
been
vanished

old
soak

ai

so
darned
much
left

so
much
as
i
use
to
for
some
reason
in
course
no
gentleman
of
the
old
school
figgers
on
less
than
a
quart
a
day
but
there
has
been
times
when
i
exceeded
that
there
limit
looking
back
on
them
times
i
do
know
whether
to
be
glad
or
sorry
it
a
satisfaction
to
remember
that
i
had
the
liquor
but
it
a
grief
to
know
i
wo
never
have
that
same
liquor
again
but
at
a
quart
a
day
if
i
careful
and
do
give
any
parties
to
new
acquaintances
that
is
took
sudden
with
a
love
and
admiration
for
me
i
toddle
along
fer
ten
or
twelve
months
yet
and
by
that
time
something
or
other
will
happen
in
my
favour
you
see
if
it
do
either
the
country
will
backslide
into
iniquity
again
in
spots
or
else
somebody
will
die
and
leave
me
an
island
down
near
cuba
or
else
old
jabe
potter
my
friend
out
on
long
island
i
told
you
of
will
get
his
smuggling
works
started
into
operation
fact
is
old
jabe
is
already
set
and
his
smuggling
works
is
ready
to
operate
right
now
only
there
do
seem
to
be
nothin
to
smuggle
jabe
says
he
got
one
of
these
here
gasolene
boats
and
he
goes
out
and
makes
signals
to
the
ocean
liners
to
and
from
europe
but
they
ai
onto
jabe
signals
or
something
i
tell
him
he
got
to
make
arrangements
in
advance
with
some
of
them
transatlantic
bartenders
for
they
do
know
what
he
driving
at
jabe
says
think
they
could
tell
by
my
looks
i
thirsty
would
you
jabe
romantic
and
optimistic
but
them
notions
of
his
is
all
right
if
they
was
only
he
paused
a
while
refreshed
himself
from
his
pocket
flask
and
then
took
up
another
line
of
enquiry
what
i
would
like
to
know
he
said
is
what
mean
folks
is
going
to
blame
their
meanness
onto
now
that
booze
is
gone
it
used
to
be
a
good
excuse
for
a
lot
of
people
that
was
worth
nothin
and
knowed
it
and
acted
ornery
booze
was
the
answer
everybody
said
if
they
did
anything
they
had
orter
people
said
they
was
all
right
except
when
they
had
a
drink
or
two
but
a
drink
or
two
changed
their
entire
disposition
and
the
drink
orter
be
blamed
and
not
them
my
own
observation
and
belief
leads
me
to
remark
that
them
kind
of
folks
was
less
ornery
and
mean
when
they
had
booze
than
when
they
did
have
it
well
i
notice
in
myself
a
kind
of
a
habit
growing
up
to
blame
everything
onto
prohibition
just
as
prohibitionists
used
to
blame
everything
onto
booze
i
want
to
be
fair
to
the
drys
and
i
will
say
that
neither
prohibition
nor
booze
has
much
to
do
with
making
a
mean
man
mean
i
want
to
be
fair
to
the
drys
so
as
to
show
them
up
they
fair
to
me
and
when
i
fair
to
them
it
shows
how
superior
i
chapter
twelve
more
of
the
history
as
it
used
to
be
of
a
morning
well
i
promised
i
would
tell
just
what
those
vanished
barrooms
was
like
and
i
will
tell
the
truth
so
help
me
one
thing
that
i
ca
get
used
to
going
without
is
that
long
brass
railing
where
you
would
rest
your
feet
and
i
have
got
one
of
them
fixed
up
in
my
own
bedroom
now
so
when
i
get
tired
setting
down
i
can
go
and
stand
up
and
rest
my
feet
one
at
a
time
well
you
would
come
in
in
the
morning
and
you
would
say
ed
i
feeling
so
good
this
morning
i
wonder
what
could
the
matter
be
ed
says
though
he
has
got
a
pretty
good
idea
of
what
it
could
be
all
the
time
but
he
too
kind
hearted
to
let
on
i
do
know
you
says
to
ed
i
guess
i
am
smoking
too
much
lately
when
you
left
here
last
night
ed
says
you
seemed
to
be
feeling
all
right
maybe
what
you
got
is
a
little
touch
of
this
here
influenza
it
ai
influenza
ed
you
says
to
him
it
is
them
heavy
cigars
we
was
all
smoking
in
here
last
night
i
swallered
too
much
of
that
smoke
ed
and
i
got
a
headache
this
morning
and
my
stomach
feels
kind
o
like
it
was
a
democratic
stomach
all
surrounded
by
republican
voters
and
a
lot
of
that
tobacco
must
of
got
into
my
eyes
and
i
feel
so
rotten
this
morning
that
when
my
wife
said
are
you
going
downtown
without
your
breakfast
i
just
said
to
her
hell
and
walked
out
to
dodge
a
row
because
i
could
see
she
was
bad
tempered
this
morning
what
would
you
say
to
a
little
absinthe
says
ed
sympathetic
and
helpful
a
cocktail
or
frappy
no
says
you
if
you
was
to
say
what
i
used
to
say
i
leave
that
there
stuff
to
these
here
young
cigarettesmoking
squirts
which
it
always
tasted
like
paregoric
to
me
yes
sir
ed
says
it
is
one
of
them
foreign
things
and
how
about
a
milk
punch
it
is
sometimes
soothing
when
a
person
has
smoked
too
much
no
ed
you
says
a
milk
punch
is
too
much
like
vittles
and
i
stand
the
idea
of
vittles
yes
sir
ed
used
to
say
you
are
right
sir
how
about
a
gin
fizz
a
gin
fizz
will
bring
back
your
stomach
to
life
right
gradual
sir
and
not
with
a
shock
like
being
raised
from
the
dead
ed
you
says
to
him
or
leastways
i
always
used
to
say
a
silver
fizz
is
too
gentle
and
one
of
them
golden
fizzes
with
the
yellow
of
an
egg
in
it
has
got
the
same
objections
as
a
milk
punch
it
is
too
much
like
vittles
yes
sir
ed
says
i
think
you
are
right
about
vittles
i
can
understand
how
you
feel
about
not
wanting
vittles
in
the
early
part
of
the
day
and
that
makes
you
love
ed
for
you
meet
a
lot
of
people
who
understand
that
there
ai
no
sympathy
and
understanding
left
in
the
world
since
bartenders
was
abolished
how
about
an
whiskey
cocktail
says
ed
you
feel
he
is
getting
nearer
to
it
and
you
tell
him
so
but
it
seem
just
like
the
right
thing
yet
and
then
ed
sees
you
ai
never
going
to
be
satisfied
with
nothing
till
after
it
is
into
you
and
he
takes
the
matter
into
his
own
hands
i
know
what
is
the
matter
with
you
he
says
and
what
you
want
and
he
mixes
you
up
a
whiskey
sour
and
you
get
a
little
cross
and
say
it
helped
some
but
there
was
too
much
sugar
in
it
and
not
to
put
so
much
sugar
in
the
next
one
and
by
the
time
you
drink
the
third
one
somewhere
away
down
deep
inside
of
you
there
is
a
warm
spot
wakes
up
and
kind
of
smiles
and
that
is
your
soul
has
waked
up
and
you
sort
of
wish
you
had
been
so
mean
with
your
wife
when
you
left
home
and
you
look
around
and
see
a
friend
and
have
one
with
him
and
your
soul
says
to
you
away
down
deep
inside
of
you
for
all
you
know
about
them
old
bible
stories
they
may
be
true
after
all
and
maybe
there
is
a
god
and
kind
of
feel
glad
there
may
be
one
and
if
your
friend
says
let
go
and
have
some
breakfast
you
are
surprised
to
find
out
you
could
eat
an
egg
if
it
ai
too
soft
or
ai
too
done
well
i
promised
so
help
me
i
would
tell
the
truth
about
them
barrooms
that
has
perished
away
and
the
truth
i
will
tell
and
the
truth
with
me
used
to
be
that
more
than
likely
it
was
really
cigars
that
used
to
get
me
feeling
that
way
in
the
mornings
and
i
will
take
up
a
different
part
of
the
subject
in
my
next
chapter
chapter
thirteen
peace
and
contentment
illustration
prohibition
said
the
old
soak
is
doing
more
harm
than
you
can
see
with
the
naked
eye
formerly
when
a
man
called
up
and
told
his
wife
that
he
was
detained
at
his
office
by
an
unexpected
caller
on
business
just
as
he
was
starting
home
his
wife
knew
he
had
stopped
to
take
three
or
four
balls
with
the
boys
on
the
corner
and
thought
very
little
about
it
now
she
wonders
if
that
unexpected
caller
could
have
been
a
lady
when
a
man
came
home
late
with
the
smell
of
liquor
on
his
breath
he
knew
he
was
in
bad
but
he
knew
just
how
bad
in
he
was
now
everything
is
uncertainty
and
guesswork
everywhere
and
intellects
is
cracking
under
strains
on
all
sides
it
must
been
the
same
way
back
in
the
historic
days
of
iniquity
and
antiquity
when
the
roman
empire
switched
all
of
a
sudden
from
being
heathen
to
being
christian
everybody
had
to
be
good
all
of
a
sudden
and
only
a
few
had
learnt
how
and
everybody
that
had
quite
succeeded
in
turning
christian
went
around
for
a
while
wondering
if
everybody
else
was
as
christian
as
they
let
on
to
be
i
know
a
lot
of
people
now
that
says
they
on
the
wagon
but
i
hate
to
go
so
sound
asleep
in
a
street
car
that
i
would
wake
up
if
they
tried
to
pull
my
flask
out
of
my
pocket
i
do
struggle
none
trying
to
be
good
myself
i
a
dipsomaniac
and
i
know
it
and
i
contented
to
be
that
way
years
ago
i
used
to
struggle
and
think
maybe
i
would
quit
drinking
some
time
and
it
kept
me
unhappy
but
as
soon
as
i
come
right
out
and
acknowledged
booze
as
my
boss
and
master
and
set
him
up
and
crowned
him
king
a
great
peace
fell
onto
me
and
i
ceased
to
struggle
and
i
been
happy
and
contented
and
full
of
love
for
my
fellow
men
ever
since
there
ai
nothing
like
finding
out
which
gang
you
belong
to
and
sticking
to
your
own
crowd
consistent
if
i
had
only
been
brought
up
to
be
a
drunkard
when
i
was
young
i
would
settled
into
it
natural
and
been
saved
a
lot
of
worry
and
struggle
and
uncertainty
but
there
was
years
when
i
fit
against
it
from
time
to
time
and
it
kept
me
unsettled
and
discontented
and
i
wasted
a
lot
of
good
time
trying
to
keep
sober
when
i
might
been
drunk
and
cheerful
radiating
joy
and
happiness
into
the
world
and
being
of
some
use
to
my
fellow
men
but
i
everybody
thinks
if
they
had
their
life
to
live
over
again
they
do
different
and
the
main
thing
is
to
reach
peace
and
contentment
toward
the
end
as
i
have
reached
chapter
fourteen
continuing
the
history
of
the
rum
demon
unfermented
grape
juice
well
as
i
said
in
my
last
chapter
it
is
time
for
me
to
get
down
to
brass
tacks
and
describe
just
what
those
barrooms
that
has
been
vanished
was
like
so
that
future
generations
of
posterity
will
know
what
they
missed
and
to
tell
the
truth
in
all
particulars
so
help
me
some
of
them
was
that
arted
up
with
hand
paintings
that
if
you
had
all
them
paintings
in
your
home
you
would
feel
proud
of
yourself
like
solomon
in
all
his
glory
and
would
feel
like
you
was
living
in
the
midst
of
a
high
art
museum
and
the
shining
brass
cuspidores
to
spit
in
and
the
brass
rail
and
all
them
shiny
glasses
and
bottles
and
mirrors
made
up
a
scene
of
grandeur
and
glory
like
the
good
book
mentions
and
you
would
think
you
was
king
faro
of
egypt
if
you
lived
in
the
midst
of
all
that
or
job
in
all
his
riches
before
the
itch
broke
out
on
him
well
speaking
of
the
good
book
my
wife
has
always
been
more
or
less
of
a
prohibitionist
in
order
to
show
me
that
she
is
independent
of
me
and
one
day
one
of
these
here
church
friends
of
hers
tries
to
tell
me
all
the
liquor
that
was
drinked
in
the
bible
was
nothing
but
unfermented
grape
juice
yes
it
was
i
said
do
you
believe
it
was
like
hell
it
was
you
go
and
get
your
testament
and
see
where
king
solomon
talks
about
the
stuff
that
makes
the
heart
merry
and
then
go
and
swill
yourself
with
grape
juice
and
see
if
you
could
get
the
way
he
was
when
he
wrote
eat
drink
and
be
merry
for
tomorrow
ye
die
and
how
about
the
time
them
two
women
came
to
him
with
that
one
child
and
both
claimed
that
it
was
hern
and
he
says
to
the
officer
on
duty
let
me
see
that
there
sword
of
yourn
for
a
minute
i
darned
soon
see
who
this
kid
belongs
to
and
verily
the
officer
drawed
his
sword
and
the
king
he
heaved
it
up
and
was
about
to
cut
the
kid
in
two
when
one
of
the
women
says
to
stop
unhand
him
king
and
not
do
the
rash
act
it
is
the
other
woman
yew
lamb
and
let
her
have
it
it
being
her
own
all
the
time
and
her
one
yew
lamb
and
her
preferring
to
see
the
other
woman
grab
it
off
than
have
half
of
it
well
says
the
king
half
a
loaf
is
better
than
no
bread
but
with
infants
it
is
different
take
the
child
it
is
yours
woman
and
go
and
sin
no
more
well
now
i
ask
you
was
king
solomon
drinking
the
unfermented
juice
of
the
grape
when
he
got
that
there
hunch
or
was
he
not
i
will
say
he
was
not
them
radical
and
righteous
ideas
never
come
to
a
man
when
he
is
cold
sober
he
has
got
to
have
a
shot
of
something
moving
around
under
his
belt
before
he
gets
thataway
and
how
about
them
bible
hangovers
i
said
to
this
here
church
person
man
and
boy
i
been
a
student
of
the
bible
from
cover
to
cover
for
a
good
many
years
now
and
i
never
seen
a
book
with
more
evidences
of
hangovers
and
katzenjammers
into
it
how
about
that
there
book
that
says
vanity
vanity
all
is
vanity
well
i
ask
you
did
you
ever
get
that
way
in
the
morning
after
you
had
spent
the
night
before
drinking
the
unfermented
juice
of
the
grape
that
there
book
of
exclusiastics
is
just
one
long
howl
from
the
next
morning
head
things
seem
right
says
old
exclusiastic
and
they
look
right
but
if
you
bite
into
them
they
do
taste
right
or
words
to
that
effect
and
you
stick
around
awhile
says
old
man
exclusiastic
and
you
darned
soon
see
they
ai
nothing
right
nowhere
and
never
will
be
again
moreover
says
he
i
was
wrong
when
i
used
to
think
things
was
right
there
ai
never
anything
anywhere
been
all
right
and
i
was
all
wrong
when
i
was
a
young
feller
and
used
to
think
things
was
right
and
the
wrongest
thing
about
the
whole
business
is
the
darned
fools
like
i
used
to
be
who
go
around
saying
things
is
all
right
and
the
sum
and
substance
of
everything
is
vanity
says
he
vanity
vanity
all
is
vanity
you
could
tell
some
folks
that
that
there
old
exclusiastic
was
writing
as
the
result
of
unfermented
grape
juice
but
a
man
with
any
experience
of
his
own
knows
a
good
deal
better
and
what
kind
of
a
taste
was
in
his
mouth
you
ca
tell
an
old
bible
reader
like
me
anything
about
this
unfermented
stuff
the
trouble
with
these
here
church
people
is
that
too
many
of
them
ai
never
read
the
bible
or
if
they
did
read
it
they
read
it
with
the
idea
that
it
was
saying
something
else
like
they
wanted
it
to
say
i
always
stuck
to
the
bible
in

nothin
but
a
dry
liquor

a
republican

idee

i
would
of
voted
agin
any
conscience
fer
the
sake
o
my
religion
but
i
ai
goin
to
be
compelled
fer
to
make
that
sacrifice

ruther
vote
fer
an
prohibitionist
than

of
these
here
fellers
that
gits
the
word
passed
private

they
be
a
stick
in

question
fer
the

come
to
live
with
us
an
i
tryin
to
marry
that
there

and
i
do

of
these
here
raids
i
read
chapter
sixteen
the
history
continued
prohibition
and
winter
weather
well
when
i
seen
all
them
men
shovelling
snow
and
ice
in
the
streets
and
no
place
to
go
for
a
drink
and
maybe
one
of
them
spring
thaws
coming
along
soon
now
which
they
are
always
full
of
these
here
la
grip
germs
i
says
to
myself
them
prohibitionists
think
they
have
done
something
pretty
smart
but
they
got
another
think
coming
to
them
i
never
been
much
of
a
hand
to
kick
against
the
weather
as
a
fact
i
use
to
like
all
kinds
of
weather
as
it
come
along
you
went
into
a
place
and
you
said
to
ed
it
looks
like
one
of
them
cold
rains
is
going
to
start
up
pretty
soon
ed
yes
sir
ed
says
it
is
pretty
raw
the
wind
is
rawring
what
will
you
have
well
i
use
to
say
i
was
wondering
about
a
little
scotch
with
boiling
water
into
it
and
a
lump
of
butter
and
a
lump
of
sugar
into
it
i
knowed
a
fellow
used
to
treat
himself
thataway
one
time
no
sir
says
ed
i
would
advise
anything
like
that
sir
it
will
get
you
sweating
inside
of
you
all
around
your
stomach
and
lungs
and
then
you
will
go
out
and
swallow
some
cold
damp
air
and
take
one
of
them
inside
colds
sir
and
it
may
run
into
or
this
here
pellicanitis
well
ed
i
do
want
to
ketch
none
of
them
germs
you
would
say
to
him
and
how
about
some
rock
and
rye
you
better
stick
to
straight
rye
and
leave
out
the
rock
when
you
was
in
here
a
little
bit
ago
you
was
drinking
straight
rye
and
you
do
want
to
be
mixing
them
too
much
says
ed
and
no
sooner
said
than
done
or
maybe
it
was
summer
time
and
a
hot
day
and
you
would
say
to
ed
i
wonder
how
many
people
is
getting
sun
struck
ed
a
good
many
says
ed
they
drink
too
much
cold
water
and
it
gets
to
them
i
am
glad
i
do
have
to
go
out
into
the
awful
heat
you
would
say
the
main
thing
is
to
keep
your
pores
open
says
ed
for
if
you
stop
the
presspiration
that
means
a
sun
stroke
the
main
thing
is
to
encourage
the
presspiration
to
sweat
itself
out
of
you
i
think
you
are
right
ed
you
says
and
i
was
wondering
about
some
beer
no
sir
not
for
you
says
ed
i
would
advise
no
beer
you
put
these
here
temperance
drinks
like
beer
and
sassperiller
into
your
stomach
sir
and
it
takes
up
a
lot
of
room
you
will
wish
you
had
later
in
the
day
for
some
people
i
would
say
beer
would
do
no
harm
sir
but
i
should
say
sir
that
it
was
the
wrong
thing
for
you
one
of
them
long
silver
fizzes
with
ice
shook
up
into
it
would
sound
nice
to
my
ears
as
it
went
down
my
oozlygoozlum
you
would
say
to
ed
ed
he
is
kind
of
lazy
with
the
heat
and
he
do
want
to
shake
it
up
so
he
says
to
you
on
a
hot
day
like
this
you
are
taking
chances
with
your
life
every
time
you
put
ice
drinks
into
you
and
he
says
what
the
matter
with
that
rye
you
been
drinking
all
the
early
part
of
the
day
that
is
the
best
thing
to
keep
the
presspiration
coming
out
of
your
sweat
pores
well
no
sooner
said
than
done
the
number
of
times
them
bartenders
has
saved
my
life
summer
and
winter
with
good
advice
is
as
too
numerous
to
mention
as
is
the
stars
in
the
sky
and
their
name
is
legend
as
the
good
book
says
in
them
days
when
there
was
a
barroom
on
every
corner
and
sometimes
four
barrooms
on
every
four
corners
i
never
cared
about
the
weather
at
all
for
i
knowed
no
matter
what
the
weather
was
i
could
keep
my
health
safe
if
you
was
to
look
out
the
barroom
window
and
see
a
sudden
change
in
the
weather
you
could
make
a
sudden
change
and
switch
to
some
other
kind
of
drink
and
keep
yourself
protected
from
them
sudden
changes
but
in
these
days
when
a
sudden
change
in
the
weather
comes
what
protection
have
you
got
i
would
like
to
know
you
are
running
the
risks
of
them
sudden
changes
all
the
time
day
and
night
and
no
chance
to
change
your
drink
to
meet
them
with
for
you
are
lucky
if
you
have
one
kind
of
liquor
let
alone
all
the
different
kinds
of
ingredients
you
used
to
ornament
your
digestion
with
nowadays
when
the
weather
ai
just
right
i
have
to
stay
home
in
my
own
room
up
to
the
top
of
the
house
where
i
got
that
little
bar
rigged
up
where
i
wait
on
myself
and
staying
to
home
all
the
time
ai
any
too
good
for
me
it
do
give
me
a
chance
to
get
any
outdoor
exercise
staying
at
home
do
and
a
man
needs
outdoor
exercise
if
he
is
going
to
keep
his
health
that
is
another
thing
prohibition
has
done
to
me
it
has
took
away
all
my
chance
for
outdoor
exercise
i
reckon
them
prohibitionists
will
be
satisfied
when
they
got
everybody
health
broke
down
on
account
of
them
sudden
changes
in
the
weather
and
nobody
getting
any
outdoor
exercise
any
more

chapter
eighteen
the
history
continued
the
barroom
good
influence
illustration
another
thing
i
miss
in
regard
to
all
them
vanished
barrooms
being
closed
up
is
kind
feeling
about
respect
to
the
old
especially
to
parents
and
them
that
has
departed
where
is
the
younger
generations
of
posterity
going
to
learn
how
to
be
kind
hearted
about
home
and
mother
now
that
the
barrooms
is
all
closed
up
i
would
like
to
know
it
used
to
be
that
a
lot
of
fellows
would
get
all
tanked
up
of
an
afternoon
or
evening
and
in
the
right
sort
of
a
place
they
would
get
to
singing
songs
all
them
songs
about
home
and
mother
and
to
treat
her
right
now
that
her
hair
had
turned
gray
i
never
was
much
of
a
one
to
sing
myself
especially
unless
i
had
a
few
drinks
into
me
but
whether
i
helped
sing
them
or
not
all
them
songs
would
make
a
better
man
of
me
you
stand
up
to
a
bar
or
sit
down
at
a
table
and
listen
to
them
songs
for
two
or
three
hours
and
if
you
are
any
kind
of
a
man
at
all
you
will
wish
you
had
always
done
the
right
thing
and
now
that
all
them
songs
about
home
and
mother
has
been
took
away
from
me
i
ai
the
man
i
used
to
be
at
all
i
feel
myself
going
down
hill
because
my
softer
emotions
and
feelings
ai
never
stirred
up
by
nothing
any
more
well
this
eighteenth
commandment
is
going
to
make
a
country
out
of
this
here
country
nobody
is
never
going
to
think
as
much
of
home
and
mother
as
they
used
to
and
i
guess
them
prohibitionists
wo
feel
so
smart
when
they
see
all
them
old
ladies
with
gray
hair
flung
out
onto
the
streets
in
the
rainy
weather
just
because
nobody
would
pay
the
mortgage
off
lots
of
times
when
i
was
a
young
feller
after
hearing
them
songs
for
awhile
i
would
say
to
myself
i
will
set
right
down
and
write
a
letter
to
my
mother
i
ai
wrote
her
for
five
or
six
months
and
when
i
got
older
after
she
passed
on
i
used
to
say
to
myself
some
of
these
days
i
will
have
to
make
a
visit
to
the
old
home
place
and
take
a
look
around
there
but
all
them
softer
feelings
has
been
took
away
from
me
now
and
what
i
would
like
to
know
is
how
is
the
younger
generation
going
to
grow
up
hard
hearted
that
is
how
some
of
these
here
fine
days
i
may
be
cast
out
into
the
street
myself
with
the
rain
drops
dripping
down
offen
my
hat
brim
into
my
eyebrows
just
because
nobody
wo
pay
a
mortgage
and
it
has
got
to
be
a
country
i
hope
none
of
them
there
smart
alick
prohis
will
be
flung
out
onto
the
street
thataway
because
they
got
no
friends
would
pay
off
their
mortgages
and
they
would
just
naturally
be
destituted
to
death
i
hard
hearted
like
they
be
and
i
hope
that
do
happen
to
none
of
them
but
if
it
ever
did
they
would
find
out
a
few
things
in
my
next
chapter
i
will
get
down
to
brass
tacks
and
give
a
true
description
of
them
barrooms
that
has
perished
off
the
face
of
the
earth
chapter
nineteen
a
house
divided
the
old
soak
has
been
looking
rather
well
for
some
time
he
seems
prosperous
and
happy
for
the
most
part
and
contented
with
the
quantity
and
quality
of
the
hootch
he
has
been
gettin
but
yesterday
he
dropped
in
to
see
us
with
just
the
slightest
shade
of
gloom
on
his
features
we
asked
him
about
it
it
that
there
son
of
mine
he
says
he
too
young
to
know
enough
to
let
well
enough
alone
like
the
good
book
says
to
do
they
a
lot
of
these
young
fellers
you
ca
learn
nothing
to
this
yere
of
mine
i
been
tellin
you
about
that
is
a
revenooer
got
my
son
made
into
a
revenooer
too
and
it
long
before
my
son
gits
jest
as
good
an
automobile
as
the
one
my
been
drivin
and
joy
out
to
our
house
has
been
unconcerned
with
everyone
exceptin
the
ol
woman
and
she
been
prayin
agin
the
rest
of
the
fambly
but
this
yere
son
o
mine
he
gets
too
much
hootch
under
his
belt
one
day
and
he
gets
into
this
yere
automobile
of
and
he
starts
onto
one
of
these
yere
raids
which
would
of
been
all
right
bein
as
it
what
a
revenooer
is
for
if
he
had
only
used
a
leetle
bit
o
jedgment
but
the
young
has
got
a
lot
to
learn
and
babes
and
striplings
the
good
book
says
jest
naturally
has
their
dam
fool
streaks
this
yere
raid
my
son
goes
onto
turns
out
all
wrong
for
whilst
he
is
pinchin
who
does
he
pinch
in
the
gang
of
wicked
sinners
but
that
there
of
mine
the
revenooer
as
got
him
his
job
said
bein
off
duty
and
pickled
hisself
at
the
time
so
this
here
of
mine
he
mighty
nigh
loses
of
his
job
as
a
revenooer
bein
took
up
in
one
of
the
raids
he
was
legally
supposed
to
be
startin
himself
and
they
was
quite
a
fuss
about
it
so
i
understand
and
the
thing
was
finally
settled
with
a
compromise
it
was
my
lost
his
job
but
they
compromised
it
and
fired
my
son
his
job
but
now
my
son
he
has
went
and
got
sore
at
my
and
he
says
unless
he
gits
his
job
back
as
a
revernooer
he
will
tell
all
he
knows
so
my
house
is
a
house
that
is
sided
against
itself
like
the
good
book
says
and
every
member
of

best
chapter

continuing
the
history
of
the
rum
demon
the
barroom
and
manners
illustration
another
thing
about
those
barrooms
that
has
been
vanished
forever
is
the
fact
that
most
of
them
was
right
polite
sort
of
places
if
a
fellow
edged
up
to
the
bar
and
knocked
over
your
glass
of
whiskey
or
something
like
that
he
would
say
o
excuse
me
stranger
and
you
would
say
sure
but
look
where
in
hell
you
are
going
to
after
this
sure
he
would
say
no
offence
meant
no
offence
taken
you
would
say
to
him
have
one
with
me
he
would
say
no
sooner
said
than
done
but
nowadays
all
you
see
and
hear
is
bad
manners
and
impoliteness
with
people
hustling
and
bumping
into
each
other
on
the
subways
and
stepping
on
each
other
and
women
and
children
amongst
them
and
nobody
ever
begging
anybody
pardon
and
hard
feelings
everywhere
the
trouble
is
everybody
is
sore
and
wanting
a
drink
all
the
time
and
there
is
no
place
where
the
younger
generation
is
going
to
learn
good
manners
now
that
the
barrooms
is
gone
what
is
the
young
fellows
just
growing
up
to
manhood
going
to
do
for
their
manners
now
that
the
barrooms
is
closed
is
what
i
want
to
know
it
used
to
be
you
would
get
onto
a
subway
train
and
there
would
be
two
or
three
women
standing
up
and
you
would
be
setting
down
and
there
would
be
three
or
four
drinks
under
your
belt
and
you
would
be
feeling
good
and
you
would
say
to
yourself
am
i
a
gentleman
or
ai
i
a
gentleman
you
damned
right
i
am
a
gentleman
you
would
say
to
yourself
here
lady
you
set
down
and
do
let
any
of
these
here
bums
roust
you
out
of
that
seat
if
any
of
these
here
bums
tries
to
roust
you
out
of
that
seat
i
will
put
a
tin
ear
onto
them
that
the
kind
of
a
gentleman
i
am
lady
they
would
have
a
hell
of
a
time
lady
getting
your
seat
away
from
you
with
me
here
and
she
seen
you
was
a
gentleman
and
she
smiled
at
you
and
you
hung
onto
a
strap
and
felt
good
but
nowadays
there
ai
no
manners
with
no
place
to
get
a
drink
or
anything
you
are
setting
in
the
subway
and
a
lady
comes
in
and
has
nowheres
to
set
and
you
say
to
yourself
let
some
of
these
other
guys
get
up
and
give
her
a
seat
and
you
think
a
while
and
you
say
to
yourself
i
bet
she
is
a
prohibitionist
anyhow
let
her
stand
up
she
has
got
to
learn
you
have
any
manners
with
the
barrooms
all
closed
and
everything
well
that
another
thing
closing
the
barroom
has
done
it
has
took
away
all
the
manners
this
town
ever
had
in
my
next
chapter
i
will
get
down
to
brass
tacks
and
tell
just
what
those
barrooms
was
like
for
the
benefit
of
future
posterity
that
has
never
seen
one
chapter
sympathy
wanted
yes
said
the

and
i
got

i

where
i
going
to
get
some
more
when
that
and
he
sighed
why
so
gloomy
then
we
asked
you
should
be
radiating
a
falstaffian
joviality
you
should
be
as
merry
as
the
merry
merry
villagers
in
an
opera
on
the
duke
birthday
but
on
the
contrary
you
shake
from
out
your
condor
wings
unutterable
wo
as
poe

it
wherefore
i
miss
he
said
the
next
mornin
sympathy
the
next
ministration
any
one
can
get
drunk
under
the
auspices
of
prohibition
but
it
takes
the
right
kind
of
barkeep
fur
to
get
you
sober
agin
and
make
you
like
it
where
is
the
next
morning
barkeep
he
ai
he
was
wise
as
a
serpent
and
gentle
as
a
dove
like
the
good
book
says
he
knowed
right
off
what
ailed
you
at
on
a
cloudy
morning
and
what
was
good
for
it
a
little
of
this
out
of
the
long
green
bottle
and
a
little
of
that
and
some
ice
tinklin
in
it
and
the
white
of
an
egg
mebby
and
oh
you
know
one
of
them
and
there
was
salve
onto
the
sore
spot
of
your
soul
two
of
them
and
you
began
to
forgive
yourself
three
of
them
and
you
could
hear
about
breakfast
you
could
look
an
egg
into
the
eye
and
he
never
asked
no
question
about
your
past
that
barkeep
did
he
did
need
to
he
knowed
he
seen
last
night

now

when

just
then
went
on
the
old
soak
a
strange
party

his
head
in
at
the
door
and
says

gloom
repentance

the
buttinski
i
calls
on

gloom
he
looks
at
the
hard
liquor
left
in
the
bottom
of
the
bottle
and
at
the
sky
and
at
the
door
of
the
barroom
across
the
street
and
he
says

done
without
some
uplift
i
need
soothing
words
and
an
educated

i
ai
never

quit
without
the
right
kind
of
a
drink
to
quit
on
and
i
not
going
to
start
any
innovations
on
a
rotten
day
like
this
well
went
on
the
old
soak
you
sits
on
the
edge
of
your
bed
and
you
listen
to
these
yere
guys
talking
and
you
think
how
right
all
of
them
is
and
you
wonder
whether
it
any
use
getting
up
and
you
think
of
all
the
barkeeps
you
used
to
know
and
after
a
while
you
suck
an
orange
and
think
of
one
of
them
long
silver
fizzes
with
frost
on
the
glass
and
charity
and
in
its
heart
like
ed
used
to
shake
up
you
think
of
it
so
hard
you
taste
it
and
then
the
meerage
fades
away
and
you
ai
nothin
but
a
camel
in
the
desert
again
with
a
humpbacked
taste
in
your
mouth
yes
sir
said
the
old
soak
i
can
get
all
the
booze
i
want
but
i
ca
get
sympathy
what
a
man
needs
in
the
morning
is
a
kind
heart
for
to
comfort
him
and
a
strong
arm
to
lean
on
anybody
can
give
me
good
advice
but
it
do
soothe
me
any
what
i
want
is
a
quick
friend
in
a
white
apron
wise
as
a
bishop
and
gentle
as
a
nurse
what
i
want
is
the
al
and
ed
i
used
to
know
but
they
went
forever
i
wo
meet
in
hell
because
they
too
kind
hearted
to
go
there
and
i
wo
meet
in
heaven
because
i
wo
go
there
myself
i
reckon
concluded
the
old
soak
i
have
to
go
to
chapter
the
history
of
the
rum
demon
concluded
prohibition
is
making
a
free
thinker
of
the
old
soak
another
thing
that
going
without
barrooms
is
doing
for
this
country
is
it
is
destroying
home
life
it
is
pretty
hard
to
get
along
with
your
wife
after
you
have
been
married
to
her
for
twenty
or
thirty
years
and
kind
of
settle
down
and
realize
you
are
going
to
be
married
to
her
as
long
as
she
lives
for
better
or
for
worse
unless
something
happens
which
it
seldom
does
not
that
you
do
kind
of
like
her
and
you
know
she
kind
of
likes
you
but
the
thing
is
that
her
and
you
is
apt
to
treat
each
other
mean
now
and
then
because
you
get
to
thinking
what
a
good
time
you
could
have
if
you
did
have
to
turn
in
so
much
of
your
money
to
making
a
home
run
smooth
and
you
know
even
if
you
do
row
with
each
other
you
will
make
up
again
and
you
get
to
kind
of
looking
forward
to
the
rows
because
anyhow
that
is
a
change
but
sometimes
you
carry
them
rows
too
far
and
then
you
do
know
how
to
get
your
home
life
running
right
again
because
she
is
always
too
stubborn
to
give
in
and
you
wo
be
the
first
one
to
give
in
because
you
know
she
is
wrong
but
when
there
was
liquor
to
be
had
in
plenty
it
was
easier
to
make
up
after
one
of
them
rows
and
home
life
went
along
smoother
you
would
get
up
in
the
morning
and
she
would
say
to
you
would
you
have
a
boiled
egg
for
breakfast
or
a
fried
and
you
would
say
hades
what
an
idea
ca
you
never
think
of
anything
but
eggs
for
breakfast
and
she
would
say
yesterday
i
did
have
eggs
and
you
was
sore
because
you
wanted
eggs
you
would
say
just
because
i
wanted
eggs
yesterday
is
that
any
sign
i
want
them
every
day
of
my
life
till
death
do
us
part
i
was
only
asking
what
you
wanted
she
would
say
i
will
go
where
i
can
get
what
i
want
you
would
say
i
will
eat
my
breakfast
at
a
restaurant
this
morning
and
maybe
i
can
keep
them
from
shoving
eggs
in
front
of
me
when
i
do
ask
for
eggs
the
trouble
with
your
stomach
is
not
what
you
put
into
it
in
the
morning
she
would
say
but
what
you
put
into
it
the
night
before
the
trouble
with
my
stomach
you
would
say
is
that
i
am
worried
to
death
and
worked
to
death
all
the
time
trying
to
keep
this
house
running
and
it
gives
me
the
it
is
the
liquor
gives
you
dispepsy
she
would
say
if
it
was
for
a
little
stimulant
in
my
stomach
like
the
good
book
says
you
tell
her
my
dispepsy
would
let
me
digest
anything
at
all
and
i
would
starve
to
death
and
the
mortgage
on
the
house
would
be
foreclosed
and
you
would
go
to
the
old
woman
home
whose
money
pays
the
interest
on
that
mortgage
she
would
say
whose
you
would
say
mine
she
would
say
you
would
have
any
money
you
tell
her
if
you
paid
me
back
what
your
relations
has
borrowed
of
me
well
one
word
leads
to
another
and
you
go
off
without
any
breakfast
for
you
see
her
taking
the
bible
down
to
set
and
read
it
and
when
she
sets
and
reads
the
bible
you
know
she
is
reading
it
against
you
and
it
gets
you
madder
and
madder
and
in
the
old
days
when
there
was
barrooms
you
would
go
into
one
still
feeling
mad
and
say
ed
mix
me
one
of
the
whiskey
cocktails
and
do
put
too
much
orange
and
that
kind
of
damned
garbage
into
it
i
want
the
kick
no
sooner
said
than
done
and
after
a
couple
of
them
you
would
say
well
after
all
the
old
woman
means
well
i
wonder
if
i
did
treat
her
a
little
mean
this
morning
i
orter
call
her
up
on
the
telephone
and
give
her
a
jolly
and
then
you
would
think
of
her
relations
that
you
hate
and
get
mad
at
her
again
on
account
of
always
sticking
up
for
them
and
say
ed
that
do
set
so
well
let
try
a
whiskey
sour
and
you
would
meet
a
friend
and
have
another
with
him
and
pretty
soon
eat
some
breakfast
and
think
how
after
all
it
was
eggs
you
was
eating
for
breakfast
and
they
was
cooked
no
ways
as
good
as
the
old
woman
would
of
poached
them
for
you
on
toast
if
you
had
been
so
darned
mean
to
her
and
your
friend
would
say
his
old
woman
blowed
him
up
for
coming
home
pickled
and
you
would
have
another
drink
and
say
that
was
one
thing
your
old
woman
never
done
to
you
my
old
woman
has
got
some
sense
you
would
say
to
him
she
knows
how
a
man
feels
about
taking
a
drink
and
she
never
blows
me
up
and
you
would
set
and
brag
about
your
old
woman
and
you
had
never
had
a
cross
word
between
you
in
thirty
years
and
then
he
would
begin
to
brag
about
his
old
woman
too
and
pretty
soon
you
would
say
to
yourself
you
better
go
to
the
phone
and
call
her
up
she
has
her
mean
streaks
all
right
but
who
knows
she
may
have
been
right
this
morning
after
all
and
you
take
another
drink
and
get
her
on
the
telephone
and
give
her
a
chance
to
say
how
sorry
she
was
about
the
way
she
treated
you
that
morning
and
maybe
you
go
and
pay
an
installment
on
a
new
carpet
sweeper
for
her
well
it
was
that
way
in
the
old
days
liquor
kept
your
home
life
running
along
you
would
get
mad
with
your
wife
and
then
you
would
get
sorry
for
her
and
give
her
an
excuse
to
make
up
with
you
again
but
now
with
no
chance
to
get
a
drink
when
i
am
away
from
home
if
i
treat
the
old
woman
mean
in
the
morning
i
do
give
her
a
chance
to
get
on
my
good
side
again
and
i
can
see
sometimes
that
it
is
breaking
her
heart
that
what
prohibition
is
doing
to
this
country
it
is
breaking
the
women
hearts
and
it
is
breaking
up
the
home
life
on
every
hand
what
is
going
to
become
of
a
country
where
all
the
home
life
is
broke
up
and
what
is
going
to
become
of
the
children
if
there
ai
any
home
life
running
along
smooth
any
more
these
prohibitionists
that
is
so
darned
smart
never
thought
of
that
i
guess
when
they
put
that
eighteenth
commandment
across
onto
us
whenever
i
think
of

she
wipes

is
fluttered

she
frightened
by
his
outburst
of
emotion
in

somewhat
formal
corner
of
a
rather
proper
ocean

i
can
understand
for
i
got

interpretative
theses
on
the
psychochemic
state
induced
in

be
reared
upon

a
very
earnest
study
of
the
looks
upon
their
faces
and
their
brave
renunciation
when
they
sobbed
and
said
i
claim
that
the
transmission
of
their
fortitude
and
pain
to
succeeding
generations
will
improve
the
moral
strain
of
the
species
here
considered

were
sitting
they
were
drinking

their

were
gritty
one

an

hardly
any

cars
through

running
filled
with
happy
people
going

such
a

totty
she
could
scarcely
tottle
saying
kiss
me

kiss
your

the
old
man
beaned
her
with
a
whiskey
bottle
outside
the

began
for
to
flutter
far
at

the

was
worn

weary
tears
washed
his
face
which
otherwise
was
pasty
she
loved
her
parents
who
commuted
on
the

afraid
you
struck
a
trifle
hasty

came
to

you

my

begging
ever

ended
now
in

i
never
had
the
courage
when
she
caught
me
sober
all
around
the

little
tots
are
begging
grandpas
and
daddies
for
to
quit
their
lushing
reformers
eggs
on
i
am
tired
of
egging
tired
of
being
cowed
cowering
and
blushing
i
struck
for
freedom
i
a
man
of
mettle
though
i
never
would
done
it
had
i
not
been
drinking
from
athabasca
south

we
must
strike
for
freedom
quit
our
shrinking
said
the
second
old
man
i
beg
your
pardon
brother
please
forgive
me
my
words
were
hasty
i
get
your
viewpoint
our
hearts

the

go

they
wave

at

slip

they
swoop

fly

then
from

whines

my

rose
up

pawed

hope

that
neither
east
nor
west
and
neither
north
nor

shall
rise
a
cloud

shed
its

blow

and
fro
shall
any
friendly
odours
find
the
nose
they
used
to
know
ill
no
stein
shall
greet
my
straining
eyes
no
matter
how
they
blink
mine
ears
shall
never
hear
again
the
highball
glasses
clink
there
is
not
anywhere
a
jug
to
cuddle
with
my
wrist
but
my
habituated
foot
remains
an
optimist
it
lifts
itself
it
curls
itself
it
feels
the
empty
air
it
seeks
a
long
brass
railing
and
the
railing
is
there
i
do
not
seek
for
sympathy
for
stomach
nor
for
throat
i
never
liked
my
liver
much
is
such
a
sulky
goat
i
do
not
seek
your
pity
for
my
writhen
tongue
and
wried
i
do
not
ask
your
tears
because
my
lips
are
shrunk
and
dried
but
oh
my
foot
my
cheated
foot
my
foot
that
lives
in
hope
it
is
a
piteous
sight
to
see
it
lift
itself
and
grope
i
look
at
it
i
talk
to
it
i
lesson
it
and
plead
but
with
a
humble
cheerfulness
that
makes
my
heart
to
bleed
it
lifts
itself
it
curls
itself
it
searches
through
the
air
it
seeks
a
long
brass
railing
and
the
railing
is
there
i
carried
it
to
church
one
day
o
foot
so
fond
and
frail
i
had
to
drag
it
forth
in
haste
it
grabbed
the
chancel
rail
my
heart
is
all
resigned
and
calm
so
likewise
is
my
soul
but
my
habituated
foot
is
quite
beyond
control
an
escalator
on
the
ell
began
its
upward
trip
my
foot
reached
up
and
clutched
the
rail
and
crushed
it
in
its
grip
it
grabs
the
headboard
of
my
bed
with
such
determined
clasp
that
i
compelled
to
scald
the
thing
to
make
it
loose
its
grasp
sometimes
it
leaps
to
clutch
the
curb
when
i
walk
down
the
street
oh
how
i
suffer
for
the
hope
that
lives
within
my
feet
myself
i
can
endure
the
drouth
with
stoic
calm
and
prayer
but
my
feet
still
seek
a
railing
when
a
railing
is
there
xiv
once
youth
was
mine
to
frank
stanton
once
the
wild
raptures
and
the
beating
wings
of
song
were
mine
the
sun
the
climbing
flight
the
wind
great
fellowship
upon
the
height
once
youth
was
mine
and
the
young
heart
that
sings
but
now
the
little
things
the
trivial
things
beat
down
my
spirit
with
their
leagued
might
could
i
within
some
friendly
dive
meet
the
old
gang
make
me
young
by
jings
as
the
mad
lark
rises
drunk
with
joy
and
sun
when
morning
bends
above
the
dewy
meadow
and
his
clear
call
proclaims
the
day
is
won
over
a
hurried
rout
of
driven
shadow
so
should
i
rise
and
sing

i
a
bun

would
that
we
were

in

to
bob
lillard
out
of
my
forehead
now
the
long
thoughts
reach
in
level
rays
that
melt
the
pleiades
which
melting
somehow
smell
like
toasted
cheese
i
know
life
secret
now
but
have
no
speech
to
utter
it
indeed
small
wish
to
teach
my
truths
to
trivial
planets
such
as
these
whereon
the
populations
drone
like
bees
that
have
no
each
stinging
each
and
yet
i
will
speak
too
the
slow
words
come
with
pain
out
of
my
deeps
of
ecstasy
burst
from
my
soul
as
from
a
beaten
drum
in
a
hoarse
pulse
of
sound
but
hark
to
me
life
secret
is
that
all
things
cool
somewhat
like
golden
bucks
but
somehow
that
seems
rot

xvii
the
battle
of
the
keyholes
to
jimmy
farnsworth
the
keyholes
to
the
right
of
me
were
dancing
of
a
jig
the
keyholes
to
the
left
of
me
were
merry
as
a
grig
the
keyholes
right
before
my
face
were
drunk
and
winked
at
me
and
i
stood
there
alone
alone
with
one
small
key
they
frightened
me
they
daunted
me
i
turned
back
to
the
stair
and
faced
nine
keyholes
pale
and
stern
that
lay
in
ambush
there
six
keyholes
on
the
ceiling
sat
eight
keyholes
on
the
door
and
seven
saddened
keyholes
lay
hiccoughing
on
the
floor
i
crawled
through
one
i
crawled
through
two
i
crawled
through
keyholes
three
and
then
i
saw
a
vistaed
mile
of
keyholes
waiting
me
i
will
not
crawl
another
yard
through
keyholes
though
i
die
oh
when
my
fighting
blood
is
up
a
turk
am
they
leapt
at
me
they
flew
at
me
they
whistled
as
they
came
they
gritted
of
their
gleaming
teeth
they
stung
and
spurted
flame
i
put
my
back
against
the
floor
and
fought
gallantly
but
what
could
anybody
do
with
one
small
key
keyholes
at
the
front
of
me
and
keyholes
on
the
flank
and
as
they
rushed
at
me
i
smelled
the
liquor
that
they
drank
keyholes
on
my
spinal
cord
and
keyholes
in
my
hair
and
with
a
heave
together
boys
they
rolled
me
down
the
stair
it
bumped
me
some
it
bent
me
some
it
broke
a
nose
or
two
and
when
the
milkman
came
he
said
what
kaiser
belgiumed
you
i
says
to
him
it
might
have
been
the
same
with
you
as
me
if
you
like

had
had
to
fight
a
gang
of
keyholes

in

to
sam

a

pursued

fled
the

thunder
of
his

snorting
he
came
his
breath
a
withering
heat
blown
soot
of
cindered
comets
freakt
his

my
hide
caught
fire
and
crackled
with
the
pace
my
burning
heart
with
jets
of
anguish
beat
flaming
i
leapt
in
flame
leapt
on
the
fleet
and
savage
star
we
slashed
our
fiery
trace
ten
constellations
broad
in
screaming
red
across
the
startled
purple
of
the
night
a
word
tremendous
clove
mine
ears

a
great
arm
fell

stripped
my
wings

flight

i
seek

never
find

beneath
the
golden
triple
star

from
the

shines
afar
i
miss
a
type
of
jest
that
was
designed
for
roaring
barrooms
warmed
with
booze
and
kind
good
gawd
how
coarse
and
low
my

miss
an

which
like
some
red

glowed
through
the

when

saw
a

upon

i
crawl
out
of
the
dripping
sea
and
greet
it
with
a
smile

around
