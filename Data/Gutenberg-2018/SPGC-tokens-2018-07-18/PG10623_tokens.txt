as

yesterday
sheriff
it
just
the
same
when
it
dropped
below

last
night
i
thought
i
better
send
frank
out
this
morning
to
make
a
fire
for
us
no
use
getting
pneumonia
with
a
big
case

yesterday
sheriff
oh
yesterday
when
i
had
to
send
frank
to
morris
center
for
that
man
who
went
crazy
i
want
you
to
know
i
had
my
hands
full
yesterday
i
knew
you
could
get
back
from
omaha
by
today
and
as
long
as
i
went
over
everything
here
myself
county
attorney
well
mr
hale
tell
just
what
happened
when
you
came
here
yesterday
morning
hale
harry
and
i
had
started
to
town
with
a
load
of
potatoes
we
came
along
the
road
from
my
place
and
as
i
got
here
i
said
i
going
to
see
if
i
ca
get
john
wright
to
go
in
with
me
on
a
party
telephone
i
spoke
to
wright
about
it
once
before
and
he
put
me
off
saying
folks
talked
too
much
anyway
and
all
he
asked
was
peace
and
quiet
i
guess
you
know
about
how
much
he
talked
himself
but
i
thought
maybe
if
i
went
to
the
house
and
talked
about
it
before
his
wife
though
i
said
to
harry
that
i
did
know
as
what
his
wife
wanted
made
much
difference
to
john
county
attorney
let
talk
about
that
later
mr
hale
i
do
want
to
talk
about
that
but
tell
now
just
what
happened
when
you
got
to
the
house
hale
i
did
hear
or
see
anything
i
knocked
at
the
door
and
still
it
was
all
quiet
inside
i
knew
they
must
be
up
it
was
past
eight
so
i
knocked
again
and
i
thought
i
heard
somebody
say
in
i
was
sure
i
not
sure
yet
but
i
opened
the
door
this
door
the
door
by
which
the
two
women
are
still
and
there
in
that
rocker
to
sat
mrs
wright
all
look
at
the
county
attorney
what
was
she
doing
hale
she
was
rockin
back
and
forth
she
had
her
apron
in
her
hand
and
was
kind
of
pleating
it
county
attorney
and
how
did
she
look
hale
well
she
looked
queer
county
attorney
how
do
you
mean
queer
hale
well
as
if
she
did
know
what
she
was
going
to
do
next
and
kind
of
done
up
county
attorney
how
did
she
seem
to
feel
about
your
coming
hale
why
i
do
think
she
minded
one
way
or
other
she
did
pay
much
attention
i
said
do
mrs
wright
it
cold
ai
it
and
she
said
it
and
went
on
kind
of
pleating
at
her
apron
well
i
was
surprised
she
did
ask
me
to
come
up
to
the
stove
or
to
set
down
but
just
sat
there
not
even
looking
at
me
so
i
said
want
to
see
john
and
then
she
laughed
i
guess
you
would
call
it
a
laugh
i
thought
of
harry
and
the
team
outside
so
i
said
a
little
sharp
i
see
john
she
says
kind
o
dull
like
he
home
says
i
says
she
home
why
ca
i
see
him
i
asked
her
out
of
patience
he
dead
says
she
says
i
she
just
nodded
her
head
not
getting
a
bit
excited
but
rockin
back
and
forth
where
is
he
says
i
not
knowing
what
to
say
she
just
pointed
upstairs
like
that
pointing
to
the
room
i
got
up
with
the
idea
of
going
up
there
i
walked
from
there
to
here
then
i
says
what
did
he
die
of
died
of
a
rope
round
his
neck
says
she
and
just
went
on
pleatin
at
her
apron
well
i
went
out
and
called
harry
i
thought
i
might
need
help
we
went
upstairs
and
there
he
was
lyin
county
attorney
i
think
i
rather
have
you
go
into
that
upstairs
where
you
can
point
it
all
out
just
go
on
now
with
the
rest
of
the
story
hale
well
my
first
thought
was
to
get
that
rope
off
it
looked
his
face
but
harry
he
went
up
to
him
and
he
said
he
dead
all
right
and
we
better
not
touch
anything
so
we
went
back
down
stairs
she
was
still
sitting
that
same
way
anybody
been
notified
i
asked
says
she
unconcerned
did
this
mrs
wright
said
harry
he
said
it
and
she
stopped
pleatin
of
her
apron
do
know
she
says
do
says
harry
says
she
you
sleepin
in
the
bed
with
him
says
harry
says
she
i
was
on
the
inside
slipped
a
rope
round
his
neck
and
strangled
him
and
you
did
wake
up
says
harry
did
wake
up
she
said
after
him
we
must
looked
as
if
we
did
see
how
that
could
be
for
after
a
minute
she
said
sleep
sound
harry
was
going
to
ask
her
more
questions
but
i
said
maybe
we
ought
to
let
her
tell
her
story
first
to
the
coroner
or
the
sheriff
so
harry
went
fast
as
he
could
to
rivers
place
where
there
a
telephone
county
attorney
and
what
did
mrs
wright
do
when
she
knew
that
you
had
gone
for
the
coroner
hale
she
moved
from
that
chair
to
this
one
over
here
to
a
small
chair
in
the
and
just
sat
there
with
her
hands
held
together
and
looking
down
i
got
a
feeling
that
i
ought
to
make
some
conversation
so
i
said
i
had
come
in
to
see
if
john
wanted
to
put
in
a
telephone
and
at
that
she
started
to
laugh
and
then
she
stopped
and
looked
at
me
scared
county
attorney
has
had
his
notebook
out
makes
a
i
dunno
maybe
it
was
scared
i
would
like
to
say
it
was
soon
harry
got
back
and
then
dr
lloyd
came
and
you
mr
peters
and
so
i
guess
that
all
i
know
that
you
do
county
attorney
i
guess
we
go
upstairs
first
and
then
out
to
the
barn
and
around
there
sheriff
convinced
that
there
was
nothing
important
here
nothing
that
would
point
to
any
motive
sheriff
nothing
here
but
kitchen
things
county
attorney
again
looking
around
the
kitchen
opens
the
door
of
a
cupboard
closet
he
gets
up
on
a
chair
and
looks
on
a
shelf
pulls
his
hand
away
county
attorney
here
a
nice
mess
women
draw
mrs
peters
the
other
oh
her
fruit
it
did
freeze
lawyer
she
worried
about
that
when
it
turned
so
cold
she
said
the
fire
go
out
and
her
jars
would
break
sheriff
well
can
you
beat
the
women
held
for
murder
and
about
her
preserves
county
attorney
i
guess
before
we
through
she
may
have
something
more
serious
than
preserves
to
worry
about
hale
well
women
are
used
to
worrying
over
trifles
two
women
move
a
little
closer
county
attorney
the
gallantry
of
a
young
and
yet
for
all
their
worries
what
would
we
do
without
the
ladies
women
do
not
unbend
he
goes
to
the
sink
takes
a
dipperful
of
water
from
the
pail
and
pouring
it
into
a
basin
washes
his
hands
starts
to
wipe
them
on
the
turns
it
for
a
cleaner
dirty
towels
his
foot
against
the
pans
under
the
not
much
of
a
housekeeper
would
you
say
ladies
mrs
hale
there
a
great
deal
of
work
to
be
done
on
a
farm
county
attorney
to
be
sure
and
yet
a
little
bow
to
i
know
there
are
some
dickson
county
farmhouses
which
do
not
have
such
roller
towels
gives
it
a
pull
to
expose
its
length
mrs
hale
those
towels
get
dirty
awful
quick
men
hands
are
always
as
clean
as
they
might
be
county
attorney
ah
loyal
to
your
sex
i
see
but
you
and
mrs
wright
were
neighbors
i
suppose
you
were
friends
too
mrs
hale
her
i
not
seen
much
of
her
of
late
years
i
not
been
in
this
house
it
more
than
a
year
county
attorney
and
why
was
that
you
did
like
her
mrs
hale
i
liked
her
all
well
enough
farmers
wives
have
their
hands
full
mr
henderson
and
then
county
attorney
yes
mrs
hale
it
never
seemed
a
very
cheerful
place
county
attorney
no
it
not
cheerful
i
should
say
she
had
the
homemaking
instinct
mrs
hale
well
i
do
know
as
wright
had
either
county
attorney
you
mean
that
they
did
get
on
very
well
mrs
hale
no
i
do
mean
anything
but
i
do
think
a
place
be
any
cheerfuller
for
john
wright
being
in
it
county
attorney
i
like
to
talk
more
of
that
a
little
later
i
want
to
get
the
lay
of
things
upstairs
now
goes
to
the
left
where
three
steps
lead
to
a
stair
sheriff
i
suppose
anything
mrs
peters
does
be
all
right
she
was
to
take
in
some
clothes
for
her
you
know
and
a
few
little
things
we
left
in
such
a
hurry
yesterday
county
attorney
yes
but
i
would
like
to
see
what
you
take
mrs
peters
and
keep
an
eye
out
for
anything
that
might
be
of
use
to
us
mrs
peters
yes
mr
henderson
women
listen
to
the
men
steps
on
the
stairs
then
look
about
the
mrs
hale
i
hate
to
have
men
coming
into
my
kitchen
snooping
around
and
criticising
arranges
the
pans
under
sink
which
lawyer
shoved
out
of
mrs
peters
of
course
it
no
more
than
their
duty
mrs
hale
duty
all
right
but
i
guess
that
deputy
sheriff
that
came
out
to
make
the
fire
might
have
got
a
little
of
this
on
the
roller
towel
a
wish
i
thought
of
that
sooner
seems
mean
to
talk
about
her
for
not
having
things
slicked
up
when
she
had
to
come
away
in
such
a
hurry
mrs
peters
has
gone
to
a
small
table
in
the
left
rear
corner
of
the
room
and
lifted
one
end
of
a
towel
that
covers
a
she
had
bread
set
mrs
hale
fixed
on
a
loaf
of
bread
beside
the
which
is
on
a
low
shelf
at
the
other
side
of
the
room
moves
slowly
toward
she
was
going
to
put
this
in
there
up
loaf
then
abruptly
drops
it
in
a
manner
of
returning
to
familiar
it
a
shame
about
her
fruit
i
wonder
if
it
all
gone
up
on
the
chair
and
i
think
there
some
here
that
all
right
mrs
peters
yes
here
it
toward
the
this
is
cherries
too
i
declare
i
believe
that
the
only
one
down
bottle
in
her
hand
goes
to
the
sink
and
wipes
it
off
on
the
she
feel
awful
bad
after
all
her
hard
work
in
the
hot
weather
i
remember
the
afternoon
i
put
up
my
cherries
last
summer
puts
the
bottle
on
the
big
kitchen
table
center
of
the
room
with
a
sigh
is
about
to
sit
down
in
the
before
she
is
seated
realizes
what
chair
it
is
with
a
slow
look
at
it
steps
back
the
chair
which
she
has
touched
rocks
back
and
mrs
peters
well
i
must
get
those
things
from
the
front
room
closet
goes
to
the
door
at
the
right
but
after
looking
into
the
other
room
steps
you
coming
with
me
mrs
hale
you
could
help
me
carry
them
go
in
the
other
room
reappear
mrs
peters
a
dress
and
skirt
mrs
hale
with
a
pair
of
mrs
peters
my
it
cold
in
there
puts
the
clothes
on
the
big
table
and
hurries
to
the
mrs
hale
the
wright
was
close
i
think
maybe
why
she
kept
so
much
to
herself
she
did
even
belong
to
the
ladies
aid
i
suppose
she
felt
she
could
do
her
part
and
then
you
enjoy
things
when
you
feel
shabby
she
used
to
wear
pretty
clothes
and
be
lively
when
she
was
minnie
foster
one
of
the
town
girls
singing
in
the
choir
but
that
oh
that
was
thirty
years
ago
this
all
you
was
to
take
in
mrs
peters
she
said
she
wanted
an
apron
funny
thing
to
want
for
there
is
much
to
get
you
dirty
in
jail
goodness
knows
but
i
suppose
just
to
make
her
feel
more
natural
she
said
they
was
in
the
top
drawer
in
this
cupboard
yes
here
and
then
her
little
shawl
that
always
hung
behind
the
door
stair
door
and
yes
here
it
is
shuts
door
leading
mrs
hale
moving
toward
mrs
peters
mrs
peters
yes
mrs
hale
mrs
hale
do
you
think
she
did
it
mrs
peters
a
frightened
oh
i
do
know
mrs
hale
well
i
do
think
she
did
asking
for
an
apron
and
her
little
shawl
worrying
about
her
fruit
mrs
peters
to
speak
glances
up
where
footsteps
are
heard
in
the
room
above
in
a
low
mr
peters
says
it
looks
bad
for
her
mr
henderson
is
awful
sarcastic
in
a
speech
and
he
make
fun
of
her
sayin
she
did
wake
up
mrs
hale
well
i
guess
john
wright
did
wake
when
they
was
slipping
that
rope
under
his
neck
mrs
peters
no
it
strange
it
must
have
been
done
awful
crafty
and
still
they
say
it
was
such
a
funny
way
to
kill
a
man
rigging
it
all
up
like
that
mrs
hale
that
just
what
mr
hale
said
there
was
a
gun
in
the
house
he
says
that
what
he
ca
understand
mrs
peters
mr
henderson
said
coming
out
that
what
was
needed
for
the
case
was
a
motive
something
to
show
anger
or
sudden
feeling
mrs
hale
is
standing
by
the
well
i
do
see
any
signs
of
anger
around
here
puts
her
hand
on
the
dish
towel
which
lies
on
the
table
stands
looking
down
at
table
one
half
of
which
is
clean
the
other
half
it
wiped
to
here
a
move
as
if
to
finish
work
then
turns
and
looks
at
loaf
of
bread
outside
the
breadbox
drops
towel
in
that
voice
of
coming
back
to
familiar
wonder
how
they
are
finding
things
upstairs
i
hope
she
had
it
a
little
more
up
there
you
know
it
seems
kind
of
sneaking
locking
her
up
in
town
and
then
coming
out
here
and
trying
to
get
her
own
house
to
turn
against
her
mrs
peters
but
mrs
hale
the
law
is
the
law
mrs
hale
i
is
her
better
loosen
up
your
things
mrs
peters
you
wo
feel
them
when
you
go
out
mrs
peters
off
her
fur
tippet
goes
to
hang
it
on
hook
at
back
of
room
stands
looking
at
the
under
part
of
the
small
corner
mrs
peters
she
was
piecing
a
quilt
brings
the
large
sewing
basket
and
they
look
at
the
bright
mrs
hale
it

over
the

out
to
the
barn
and
get
that
cleared
up
men

mrs

takin
up

evidence
sits
down
at
the
big
table
smoothing
out
a
block
with
i
do
see
as
it
anything
to
laugh
about
mrs
peters
of
course
they
got
awful
important
things
on
their
minds
up
a
chair
and
joins
mrs
hale
at
the
mrs
hale
another
mrs
peters
look
at
this
one
here
this
is
the
one
she
was
working
on
and
look
at
the
sewing
all
the
rest
of
it
has
been
so
nice
and
even
and
look
at
this
it
all
over
the
place
why
it
looks
as
if
she
did
know
what
she
was
about
she
has
said
this
they
look
at
each
other
then
start
to
glance
back
at
the
door
after
an
mrs
hale
pulled
at
a
knot
and
ripped
the
mrs
peters
oh
what
are
you
doing
mrs
hale
mrs
hale
just
pulling
out
a
stitch
or
two
that
not
sewed
very
good
a
bad
sewing
always
made
me
fidgety
mrs
peters
nervously
i
do
think
we
ought
to
touch
things
mrs
hale
i
just
finish
up
this
end
stopping
and
leaning
mrs
peters
mrs
peters
yes
mrs
hale
mrs
hale
what
do
you
suppose
she
was
so
nervous
about
mrs
peters
oh
i
do
know
i
do
know
as
she
was
nervous
i
sometimes
sew
awful
queer
when
i
just
tired
mrs
hale
to
say
something
looks
mrs
peters
goes
on
well
i
must
get
these
things
wrapped
up
they
may
be
through
sooner
than
we
think
apron
and
other
things
i
wonder
where
i
can
find
a
piece
of
paper
and
string
mrs
hale
in
that
cupboard
maybe
mrs
peters
in
why
here
a
it
did
she
have
a
bird
mrs
hale
mrs
hale
why
i
do
know
whether
she
did
or
not
i
not
been
here
for
so
long
there
was
a
man
around
last
year
selling
canaries
cheap
but
i
do
know
as
she
took
one
maybe
she
did
she
used
to
sing
real
pretty
herself
mrs
peters
seems
funny
to
think
of
a
bird
here
but
she
must
have
had
one
or
why
would
she
have
a
cage
i
wonder
what
happened
to
it
mrs
hale
i
maybe
the
cat
got
it
mrs
peters
no
she
did
have
a
cat
she
got
that
feeling
some
people
have
about
cats
being
afraid
of
them
my
cat
got
in
her
room
and
she
was
real
upset
and
asked
me
to
take
it
out
mrs
hale
my
sister
bessie
was
like
that
queer
ai
it
mrs
peters
the
why
look
at
this
door
it
broke
one
hinge
is
pulled
apart
mrs
hale
looks
as
if
someone
must
have
been
rough
with
it
mrs
peters
why
yes
brings
the
cage
forward
and
puts
it
on
the
mrs
hale
i
wish
if
they
going
to
find
any
evidence
they
be
about
it
i
do
like
this
place
mrs
peters
but
i
awful
glad
you
came
with
me
mrs
hale
it
would
be
lonesome
for
me
sitting
here
alone
mrs
hale
it
would
would
it
her
but
i
tell
you
what
i
do
wish
mrs
peters
i
wish
i
had
come
over
sometimes
when
was
here
i
around
the
wish
i
had
mrs
peters
but
of
course
you
were
awful
busy
mrs
hale
your
house
and
your
children
mrs
hale
i
could
come
i
stayed
away
because
it
cheerful
and
that
why
i
ought
to
have
come
i
i
never
liked
this
place
maybe
because
it
down
in
a
hollow
and
you
do
see
the
road
i
dunno
what
it
is
but
it
a
lonesome
place
and
always
was
i
wish
i
had
come
over
to
see
minnie
foster
sometimes
i
can
see
now
her
mrs
peters
well
you
must
reproach
yourself
mrs
hale
somehow
we
just
do
see
how
it
is
with
other
folks
until
something
comes
up
mrs
hale
not
having
children
makes
less
work
but
it
makes
a
quiet
house
and
wright
out
to
work
all
day
and
no
company
when
he
did
come
in
did
you
know
john
wright
mrs
peters
mrs
peters
not
to
know
him
i
seen
him
in
town
they
say
he
was
a
good
man
mrs
hale
yes
good
he
did
drink
and
kept
his
word
as
well
as
most
i
guess
and
paid
his
debts
but
he
was
a
hard
man
mrs
peters
just
to
pass
the
time
of
day
with
him
like
a
raw
wind
that
gets
to
the
bone
her
eye
falling
on
the
i
should
think
she
would
wanted
a
bird
but
what
do
you
suppose
went
with
it
mrs
peters
i
do
know
unless
it
got
sick
and
died
reaches
over
and
swings
the
broken
door
swings
it
again
both
women
watch
mrs
hale
you
were
raised
round
here
were
you
peters
shakes
her
you
did
know
her
mrs
peters
not
till
they
brought
her
yesterday
mrs
hale
she
come
to
think
of
it
she
was
kind
of
like
a
bird
herself
real
sweet
and
pretty
but
kind
of
timid
and
fluttery
how
she
did
change
then
as
if
struck
by
a
happy
thought
and
relieved
to
get
back
to
everyday
tell
you
what
mrs
peters
why
do
you
take
the
quilt
in
with
you
it
might
take
up
her
mind
mrs
peters
why
i
think
that
a
real
nice
idea
mrs
hale
there
could
possibly
be
any
objection
to
it
could
there
now
just
what
would
i
take
i
wonder
if
her
patches
are
in
here
and
her
things
look
in
the
sewing
mrs
hale
here
some
red
i
expect
this
has
got
sewing
things
in
it
out
a
fancy
what
a
pretty
box
looks
like
something
somebody
would
give
you
maybe
her
scissors
are
in
here
box
suddenly
puts
her
hand
to
her
why
mrs
peters
nearer
then
turns
her
face
there
something
wrapped
up
in
this
piece
of
silk
mrs
peters
why
this
is
her
scissors
mrs
hale
the
oh
mrs
peters
it
mrs
peters
mrs
peters
it
the
bird
mrs
hale
but
mrs
peters
look
at
it
it
neck
look
at
its
neck
it
all
other
side
mrs
peters
somebody
wrung
its
neck
eyes
meet
a
look
of
growing
comprehension
of
horror
steps
are
heard
mrs
hale
box
under
quilt
pieces
and
sinks
into
her
chair
sheriff
county
attorney
mrs
peters
county
attorney
one
turning
from
serious
things
to
little
well
ladies
have
you
decided
whether
she
was
going
to
quilt
it
or
knot
it
mrs
peters
we
think
she
was
going
to
knot
it
county
attorney
well
that
interesting
i
sure
the
has
the
bird
flown
mrs
hale
more
quilt
pieces
over
the
we
think
the
cat
got
it
county
attorney
is
there
a
cat
mrs
hale
in
a
quick
covert
way
mrs
peters
mrs
peters
well
not
now
they
superstitious
you
know
they
leave
county
attorney
sheriff
peters
an
interrupted
no
sign
at
all
of
anyone
having
come
from
the
outside
their
own
rope
now
let
go
up
again
and
go
over
it
piece
by
piece
start
it
would
have
to
have
been
someone
who
knew
just
the
mrs
peters
down
the
two
women
sit
there
not
looking
at
one
another
but
as
if
peering
into
something
and
at
the
same
time
holding
back
when
they
talk
now
it
is
in
the
manner
of
feeling
their
way
over
strange
ground
as
if
afraid
of
what
they
are
saying
but
as
if
they
can
not
help
saying
mrs
hale
she
liked
the
bird
she
was
going
to
bury
it
in
that
pretty
box
mrs
peters
a
when
i
was
a
girl
my
kitten
there
was
a
boy
took
a
hatchet
and
before
my
eyes
and
before
i
could
get
there
her
face
an
if
they
had
held
me
back
i
would
have
herself
looks
upstairs
where
steps
are
heard
falters
hurt
him
mrs
hale
a
slow
look
around
i
wonder
how
it
would
seem
never
to
have
had
any
children
around
no
wright
like
the
bird
a
thing
that
sang
she
used
to
sing
he
killed
that
too
mrs
peters
we
do
know
who
killed
the
bird
mrs
hale
i
knew
john
wright
mrs
peters
it
was
an
awful
thing
was
done
in
this
house
that
night
mrs
hale
killing
a
man
while
he
slept
slipping
a
rope
around
his
neck
that
choked
the
life
out
of
him
mrs
hale
his
neck
choked
the
life
out
of
him
hand
goes
out
and
rests
on
the
mrs
peters
rising
we
do
know
who
killed
him
we
mrs
hale
own
feeling
not
if
there
been
years
and
years
of
nothing
then
a
bird
to
sing
to
you
it
would
be
awful
still
after
the
bird
was
still
mrs
peters
within
her
i
know
what
stillness
is
when
we
homesteaded
in
dakota
and
my
first
baby
died
after
he
was
two
years
old
and
me
with
no
other
then
mrs
hale
how
soon
do
you
suppose
they
be
through
looking
for
the
evidence
mrs
peters
i
know
what
stillness
is
herself
the
law
has
got
to
punish
crime
mrs
hale
mrs
hale
as
if
answering
i
wish
you
seen
minnie
foster
when
she
wore
a
white
dress
with
blue
ribbons
and
stood
up
there
in
the
choir
and
sang
look
around
the
oh
i
i
come
over
here
once
in
a
while
that
was
a
crime
that
was
a
crime
who
going
to
punish
that
mrs
peters
we
must
take
on
mrs
hale
i
might
have
known
she
needed
help
i
know
how
things
can
be
for
women
i
tell
you
it
queer
mrs
peters
we
live
close
together
and
we
live
far
apart
we
all
go
through
the
same
things
all
just
a
different
kind
of
the
same
thing
her
eyes
noticing
the
bottle
of
fruit
reaches
out
for
if
i
was
you
i
would
tell
her
her
fruit
was
gone
tell
her
it
tell
her
all
right
take
this
in
to
prove
it
to
her
she
she
may
never

false
my
it
a
good
thing
the
men
could
hear

would
they
just
laugh
getting
all
stirred
up
over
a
little
thing
like
a
dead
canary
as
if
that
could
have
anything
to
do
with
with
would
they

are
heard
coming
down

maybe
they
would
maybe
they
would
county
attorney
no
peters
it
all
perfectly
clear
except
a
reason
for
doing
it
but
you
know
juries
when
it
comes
to
women
if
there
was
some
definite
thing
something
to
show
something
to
make
a
story
about
a
thing
that
would
connect
up
with
this
strange
way
of
doing

sheepish
little
force
of
habit

how

it
the
sand

put
his
place
on
the
blink
all
right
and
then
when
it
gets
too
for
a
station
a
lady
takes
it
for
a
summer
residence
and
then
spends
the
winter
she
a
cheerful
one
tony
a
woman
she
makes
things
pretty
this
not
like
a
place
where
a
woman
live
on
the
floor
there
is
nothing
on
the
wall
there
is
nothing
things
to
express
it
with
his
do
not
hang
on
other
things
bradford
no
things
do
not
hang
on
other
things
in
my
opinion
the
woman
crazy
sittin
over
there
on
the
sand
gesture
towards
the
what
she
at
there
ai
nothin
to
and
i
know
the
woman
that
works
for
crazy
allie
mayo
she
a
provincetown
girl
she
was
all
right
once
but
mrs
patrick
in
from
the
hall
at
the
right
she
is
a
woman
a
sophisticated
person
who
has
been
caught
into
something
as
unlike
the
old
life
as
the
dunes
are
unlike
a
meadow
at
the
moment
she
is
excited
and
mrs
patrick
you
have
no
right
here
this
is
the
station
any
more
just
because
it
used
to
be
i
do
see
why
you
should
think
this
is
my
house
and
i
want
my
house
to
myself
captain
his
head
through
the
door
one
arm
of
the
man
he
is
working
with
is
raised
and
the
hand
reaches
through
the
well
i
must
say
lady
i
would
think
that
any
house
could
be
a
station
when
the
sea
had
sent
a
man
to
it
mrs
patrick
has
turned
away
so
she
can
not
see
the
i
want
him
here
i
yet
i
must
have
my
house
to
myself
captain
you
get
your
house
to
yourself
when
i
made
up
my
mind
there
no
more
life
in
this
man
a
good
many
lives
have
been
saved
in
this
house
mrs
patrick
i
believe
that
your
name
and
if
there
any
chance
of
bringing
one
more
back
from
the
dead
the
fact
that
you
own
the
house
ai
goin
to
make
a
damn
bit
of
difference
to
me
mrs
patrick
a
thin
wild
i
must
have
my
house
to
myself
captain
hell
with
such
a
woman
the
man
he
is
working
with
and
slams
the
door
shut
as
captain
if
there
any
chance
of
bringing
one
more
back
from
the
allie
mayo
appeared
outside
the
wide
door
which
gives
on
to
the
dunes
a
bleak
woman
who
at
first
seems
little
more
than
a
part
of
the
sand
before
which
she
stands
but
as
she
listens
to
this
conflict
one
suspects
in
her
that
peculiar
intensity
of
twisted
things
which
grow
in
unfavoring
mrs
patrick
i
i
do
want
them
here
i
must
suddenly
she
retreats
and
is
bradford
well
i
could
say
allie
mayo
that
you
work
for
any
too
a
lady
what
the
matter
with
the
woman
does
she
want
folks
to
die
appears
to
break
her
all
up
to
see
somebody
trying
to
save
a
life
what
work
for
such
a
fish
for
a
crazy
fish
that
what
i
call
the
woman
i
seen
her
day
after
day
settin
over
there
where
the
dunes
meet
the
woods
just
sittin
there
lookin
thinking
of
i
believe
she
to
see
the
sand
slippin
down
on
the
woods
pleases
her
to
see
somethin
gettin
buried
i
guess
allie
mayo
has
stepped
inside
the
door
and
moved
half
across
the
room
toward
the
corridor
at
the
right
is
arrested
by
this
last
stands
a
moment
as
if
seeing
through
something
then
slowly
on
and
bradford
some
coffee
taste
good
but
coffee
in
this
house
oh
no
it
might
make
somebody
feel
better
the
door
that
was
slammed
want
me
now
captain
no
bradford
oh
that
boy
dead
captain
dannie
sears
was
dead
too
shut
that
door
i
do
want
to
hear
that
woman
voice
again
ever
the
door
and
sitting
on
a
bench
built
into
that
corner
between
the
big
sliding
door
and
the
room
where
captain
bradford
they
a
cheerful
pair
of
women
livin
in
this
cheerful
place
a
place
that
life
savers
had
to
turn
over
to
the
sand
huh
this
patrick
woman
used
to
be
all
right
she
and
her
husband
was
summer
folks
over
in
town
they
used
to
picnic
over
here
on
the
outside
it
was
joe
dyer
he
always
talkin
to
summer
folks
told
the
government
was
goin
to
build
the
new
station
and
sell
this
one
by
sealed
bids
i
heard
them
talkin
about
it
they
was
sittin
right
down
there
on
the
beach
eatin
their
supper
they
was
goin
to
put
in
a
and
they
was
goin
to
paint
it
bright
colors
and
have
parties
over
here
summer
folk
notions
their
bid
won
it
who
want
it
a
buried
house
you
move
tony
i
see
no
bright
colors
bradford
do
you
how
astonishin
you
must
be
color
blind
and
i
guess
the
first
party
i
was
in
bill
joseph
grocery
store
one
day
last
november
when
in
she
comes
mrs
patrick
from
new
york
come
to
take
the
old
station
says
she
going
to
sleep
over
there
tonight
huh
bill
is
used
to
queer
ways
he
deals
with
summer
folks
but
that
got
november
an
empty
house
a
buried
house
you
might
say
off
here
on
the
outside
shore
way
across
the
sand
from
man
or
beast
he
got
it
out
of
her
not
by
what
she
said
but
by
the
way
she
looked
at
what
he
said
that
her
husband
had
died
and
she
was
runnin
off
to
hide
herself
i
guess
a
person
feel
sorry
for
her
if
she
were
so
and
so
doggon
but
mean
folks
have
got
minds
of
their
own
she
slept
here
that
night
bill
had
men
hauling
things
till
after
dark
bed
stove
coal
and
then
she
wanted
somebody
to
work
for
her
says
she
does
say
an
unnecessary
word
well
then
bill
come
to
the
back
of
the
store
i
said
to
me
as
if
allie
mayo
was
the
party
she
lookin
for
allie
mayo
has
got
a
prejudice
against
words
or
maybe
she
likes

well
she
savin
of
she
not
spoke
an
unnecessary
word
for
twenty
years
she
got
her
reasons
women

he
looks
tired

and
i
can
tell

little
back

under
her
breath
she
pushes
the
sand
by

half
buried
grass
though

wood
to
guard
a
town

an
arm
that

on
the

of

they
turn
when

you
ever
see
the
sails
come
round
here
when
the
sky
is
dark
a
line
of
them
swift
to
the
harbor
where
their
children

go
back
back
to
your
edge
of
the
woods
that
the
of
the
mrs

the
edge
of
life
where

trails
off
to
dwarfed
things
not
worth
a
name
sits
down
in
the
allie

not
worth
a
name
and
meeting

outside
with
the
sense

wonder
of
mrs

and
letting
it
drift
through
her
they
what
the
sand
will
let
them
be

take
strange
shapes
like
shapes
of
blown
sand
allie

meeting
the
outside
nearer
speaking
more
i
know
why
you
came
here
to
this
house
that
had
been
given
up
on
this
shore
where
only
savers
of
life
try
to
live
i
know
what
holds
you
on
these
dunes
and
draws
you
over
there
but
other
things

true
beside
the
things

do
you
know
they
are
where
have
you
been
for
twenty
years

i
curtain
lifts
on
a
place
that
is
dark
save
for
a
shaft
of
light
from
below
which
comes
up
through
an
open
in
the
floor
this
slants
up
and
strikes
the
long
leaves
and
the
huge
brilliant
blossom
of
a
strange
plant
whose
twisted
stem
projects
from
right
front
nothing
is
seen
except
this
plant
and
its
shadow
a
violent
wind
is
heard
a
moment
later
a
buzzer
it
buzzes
once
long
and
three
short
silence
again
the
buzzer
then
from
below
his
shadow
blocking
the
light
anthony
rugged
man
past
middle
life
he
emerges
from
the
stairway
into
the
darkness
of
the
room
is
dimly
seen
taking
up
a
anthony
yes
miss
claire
i
see
brings
a
thermometer
to
the
stairway
for
light
looks
sharply
then
returns
to
the
it
down
to
the
plants
are
in
danger
great
relief
and
oh
that
fine
up
the
fine
goes
back
down
the
stairway
closing
the
upon
himself
and
the
curtain
is
drawn
upon
darkness
and
wind
it
opens
a
moment
later
on
the
greenhouse
in
the
sunshine
of
a
snowy
morning
the
snow
piled
outside
is
at
times
blown
through
the
air
the
frost
has
made
patterns
on
the
glass
as
if
as
plato
would
have
it
the
patterns
inherent
in
abstract
nature
and
behind
all
life
had
to
come
out
not
only
in
the
creative
heat
within
but
in
the
creative
cold
on
the
other
side
of
the
glass
and
the
wind
makes
patterns
of
sound
around
the
glass
house
the
back
wall
is
low
the
glass
roof
slopes
sharply
up
there
is
an
outside
door
a
little
toward
the
right
from
outside
two
steps
lead
down
to
it
at
left
a
glass
partition
and
a
door
into
the
inner
room
one
sees
a
little
way
into
this
room
at
right
there
is
no
dividing
wall
save
large
plants
and
vines
a
narrow
aisle
between
shelves
of
plants
leads
off
this
is
not
a
greenhouse
where
plants
are
being
displayed
nor
the
usual
workshop
for
the
growing
of
them
but
a
place
for
experiment
with
plants
a
laboratory
at
the
back
grows
a
strange
vine
it
is
arresting
rather
than
beautiful
it
creeps
along
the
low
wall
and
one
branch
gets
a
little
way
up
the
glass
you
might
see
the
form
of
a
cross
in
it
if
you
happened
to
think
it
that
way
the
leaves
of
this
vine
are
not
the
form
that
leaves
have
been
they
are
at
once
repellent
and
anthony
at
work
preparing
soil
mixing
sifting
as
the
wind
tries
the
door
he
goes
anxiously
to
the
thermometer
nods
as
if
reassured
and
returns
to
his
work
the
buzzer
sounds
he
starts
to
answer
the
telephone
remembers
something
halts
and
listens
sharply
it
does
not
buzz
once
long
and
three
short
then
he
returns
to
his
work
the
buzzer
goes
on
and
on
in
impatient
jerks
which
mount
in
anger
several
anthony
almost
compelled
by
this
insistence
but
the
thing
that
holds
him
back
is
stronger
at
last
after
a
particularly
mad
splutter
to
anthony
to
make
retort
the
buzzer
gives
it
anthony
on
preparing
soil
a
moment
later
the
glass
door
swings
violently
in
snow
blowing
in
and
mr
harry
archer
in
a
anthony
oh
please
close
the
door
sir
harry
do
you
think
i
not
trying
to
holds
it
open
to
say
anthony
but
please
this
stormy
air
is
not
good
for
the
plants
harry
i
suppose
it
just
the
thing
for
me
now
what
do
you
mean
anthony
by
not
answering
the
phone
when
i
buzz
for
you
anthony
miss
claire
mrs
archer
told
me
not
to
harry
told
you
not
to
answer
me
anthony
not
you
especially
nobody
but
her
harry
well
i
like
her
nerve
and
yours
anthony
you
see
she
thought
it
took
my
mind
from
my
work
to
be
interrupted
when
i
out
here
and
so
it
does
so
she
buzzes
once
long
and
well
she
buzzes
her
way
and
all
other
buzzing
harry
may
buzz
anthony
she
thought
it
would
be
better
for
the
flowers
harry
i
am
not
a
flower
true
but
i
too
need
a
little
attention
and
a
little
heat
will
you
please
tell
me
why
the
house
is
frigid
anthony
miss
claire
ordered
all
the
heat
turned
out
here
explaining
it
miss
claire

see
the
roses
need
a
great
deal
of
heat
harry
the
the
roses
have
i
have
anthony
yes
the
roses
need
harry
anthony
this
is
an
outrage
anthony
i
think
it
is
myself
when
you
consider
what
we
paid
for
the
heating
plant
but
as
long
as
it
is
defective
why
miss
claire
would
never
have
done
what
she
has
if
she
had
looked
out
for
her
plants
in
just
such
ways
as
this
have
you
forgotten
that
breath
of
life
is
about
to
flower
harry
and
where
my
breakfast
about
to
flower
that
what
i
want
to
know
anthony
why
miss
claire
got
up
at
five
to
order
the
heat
turned
off
from
the
house
harry
i
see
you
admire
her
vigilance
anthony
oh
i
do
i
do
harm
was
near
and
that
woke
her
up
harry
and
what
about
the
harm
to
his
do
roses
get
pneumonia
anthony
oh
yes
yes
indeed
they
do
why
mr
archer
look
at
miss
claire
herself
has
she
given
her
heat
to
the
roses
harry
the
rug
around
him
preparing
for
the
she
has
the
fire
within
anthony
now
is
that
true
how
well
you
said
it
a
glare
for
this
harry
the
door
it
blows
away
from
please
do
close
the
door
harry
you
think
it
is
the
aim
of
my
life
to
hold
it
open
anthony
hold
of
growing
things
need
an
even
temperature
saying
this
he
gets
the
man
out
into
the
anthony
the
thermometer
not
as
pleased
this
time
as
he
was
before
he
then
looks
minutely
at
two
of
the
plants
one
is
a
rose
the
other
a
flower
without
a
name
because
it
has
not
long
enough
been
a
flower
peers
into
the
hearts
of
them
then
from
a
drawer
under
a
shelf
takes
two
paper
bags
puts
one
over
each
of
these
flowers

this
time
miss
claire
when
breath
of
life
opens
and
we
see
its
heart
claire
toward
the
inner
room
because
of
intervening
plants
they
do
not
see
what
is
seen
from
the
front
a
plant
like
caught
motion
and
of
a
greater
transparency
than
plants
have
had
its
leaves
like
waves
that
curl
close
around
a
heart
that
is
not
seen
this
plant
stands
by
itself
in
what
because
of
the
arrangement
of
things
about
it
is
a
hidden
place
but
nothing
is
between
it
and
the
claire
yes
if
the
heart
has
little
held
its
own
then
breath
of
life
is
alive
in
its
otherness
but

is
running
back
to
what
it
broke

calculated
to
put
one
at
one
ease
claire
no
i
care
nothing
about
your
ease
or
about
dick
ease
dick
and
no
doubt
that
what
makes
you
so
fascinating
a
hostess
claire
was
i
a
fascinating
hostess
last
night
dick
night
of
love
the
barcorole
of
of
harry
we
got
to
have
salt
starts
for
the
claire
in
ahead
of
him
locks
it
takes
the
key
he
marches
off
claire
after
that
end
always
locked
dick
claire
darling
i
wish
you
would
say
those
startling
things
you
do
get
away
with
it
but
i
confess
it
gives
me
a
shock
and
really
it
unwise
claire
have
you
learned
that
the
best
place
to
hide
is
in
the
truth
harry
why
wo
you
believe
me
harry
when
i
tell
you
the
truth
about
doors
being
locked
harry
claire
it
selfish
of
you
to
keep
us
from
eating
salt
just
because
you
do
eat
salt
claire
one
of
her
swift
oh
harry
try
your
egg
without
salt
please
please
try
it
without
salt
intensity
which
seems
all
out
of
proportion
to
the
harry
an
egg
demands
salt
claire
egg
demands
salt
do
you
know
harry
why
you
are
such
an
unseasoned
person
egg
demands
salt
harry
well
it
does
always
get
it
claire
but
your
spirit
gets
no
lift
from
the
salt
withheld
harry
not
an
inch
of
lift
back
to
his
claire
and
pleased
so
pleased
with
itself
for
getting
no
lift
sure
it
is
just
the
right
kind
of
spirit
because
it
gets
no
lift
but
dick
you
must
have
tried
your
egg
without
salt
dick
i
try
it
now
goes
to
the
breakfast
claire
you
must
have
tried
and
tried
things
is
that
the
way
one
leaves
the
normal
and
gets
into
the
byways
of
perversion
harry
claire
dick
back
his
if
so
i
prefer
to
wait
for
the
salt
harry
claire
there
is
a
claire
precisely
what
i
had
in
mind
to
perversion
too
there
is
a
limit
so
the
fortifications
are
unassailable
if
one
ever
does
get
out
i
suppose
it
is
quite
unexpectedly
and
perhaps
a
bit
terribly
harry
get
out
where
claire
a
bright
where
you
darling
will
never
go
harry
and
from
which
you
darling
had
better
beat
it
claire
i
wish
i
could
no
no
i
do
either
this
troubled
thing
turns
her
to
the
plant
she
puts
by
themselves
the
two
anthony
with
paper
bags
is
about
to
remove
these
harry
a
claire
you
ca
smoke
here
the
plants
are
not
used
to
it
harry
then
i
should
think
smoking
would
be
just
the
thing
for
them
claire
there
is
design
harry
dick
am
i
supposed
to
be
answered
i
never
can
be
quite
sure
at
what
moment
i
am
answered
both
claire
has
uncovered
the
plants
and
is
looking
intently
into
the
flowers
from
a
drawer
she
takes
some
tools
very
carefully
gives
the
rose
pollen
to
an
unfamiliar
flower
rather
wistfully
unfamiliar
which
stands
above
on
a
small
shelf
near
the
door
of
the
inner
dick
what
is
this
you
doing
claire
claire
pollenizing
crossing
for
fragrance
dick
it
all
rather
mysterious
is
it
harry
and
claire
does
make
it
any
less
so
claire
can
i
make
life
any
less
mysterious
harry
if
you
know
what
you
are
doing
why
ca
you
tell
dick
dick
never
mind
after
all
why
should
i
be
told
turns
that
she
wants
to
tell
him
helpless
as
one
who
can
not
get
across
a
stream
starts
claire
i
want
to
give
fragrance
to
breath
of
life
the
room
beyond
the
wall
of
the
flower
i
have
created
that
is
outside
what
flowers
have
been
what
has
gone
out
should
bring
fragrance
from
what
it
has
left
but
no
definite
fragrance
no
limiting
enclosing
thing
i
call
the
fragrance
i
am
trying
to
create
reminiscence
hand
on
the
pot
of
the
wistful
little
flower
she
has
just
given
reminiscent
of
the
rose
the
violet
arbutus
but
a
new
thing
itself
breath
of
life
may
be
lonely
out
in
what
has
been
perhaps
some
day
i
can
give
it
reminiscence
dick
i
see
claire
claire
i
wonder
if
you
do
harry
now
claire
you
going
to
be
gay
are
you
these
are
tom
last
couple
of
days
with
us
claire
that
does
make
me
especially
gay
harry
well
you
want
him
to
remember
you
as
yourself
do
you
claire
i
would
like
him
to
oh
i
would
like
him
to
harry
then
be
amusing
that
really
you
is
it
dick
dick
not
quite
all
of
her
i
should
say
claire
careful
dick
are
you
indiscreet
harry
will
be
suspecting
that
i
am
your
latest
strumpet
harry
claire
what
language
you
use
a
person
knowing
you
only
by
certain
moments
could
never
be
made
to
believe
you
are
a
refined
woman
claire
true
is
it
dick
harry
it
would
be
a
good
deal
of
a
lark
to
let
them
listen
in
at
times
then
tell
them
that
here
is
the
flower
of
new
england
claire
well
if
this
is
the
flower
of
new
england
then
the
half
has
never
been
told
dick
about
new
england
claire
i
thought
i
meant
that
perhaps
i
meant
about
me
harry
on
with
his
own
explain
that
this
is
what
came
of
the
men
who
made
the
laws
that
made
new
england
that
here
is
the
flower
of
those
gentlemen
of
culture
who
dick
moulded
the
american
mind
claire
oh
is
harry
now
what
the
matter
claire
i
want
to
get
away
from
them
harry
rest
easy
little
one
you
do
claire
i
not
so
sure
that
i
do
but
it
can
be
done
we
need
not
be
held
in
forms
moulded
for
us
there
is
outness
and
otherness
harry
now
claire
i
did
mean
to
start
anything
serious
claire
no
you
never
mean
to
do
that
i
want
to
break
it
up
i
tell
you
i
want
to
break
it
up
if
it
were
all
in
pieces
we
be
little
shocked
to
aliveness
dick
would
we
there
would
be
strange
new
comings
together
mad
new
comings
together
and
we
would
know
what
it
is
to
be
born
and
then
we
might
know
that
we
are
smash
it
hand
is
near
an
as
you
smash
an
egg
pushes
the
egg
over
the
edge
of
the
table
and
leans
over
and
looks
as
over
a
harry
a
well
all
you
smashed
is
the
egg
and
all
that
amounts
to
is
that
now
tom
gets
no
egg
so
that
that
claire
difficulty
drawing
herself
back
from
the
fascination
of
the
you
think
i
ca
smash
anything
you
think
life
break
up
and
go
outside
what
it
was
because
you
gone
dead
in
the
form
in
which
you
found
yourself
you
think
that
all
there
is
to
the
whole
adventure
and
that
is
called
sanity
and
made
a
virtue
to
lock
one
in
you
never
worked
with
things
that
grow
things
that
take
a
sporting
chance
go
mad
that
sanity
may
lock
them
in
from
life
untouched
from
life
that
waits
turns
toward
the
inner
breath
of
life
goes
in
harry
oh
i
wish
claire
would
be
strange
like
that
what
is
it
what
the
matter
dick
it
merely
the
excess
of
a
particularly
rich
temperament
harry
but
it
growing
on
her
i
sometimes
wonder
if
all
this
the
place
around
is
a
good
thing
it
would
be
all
right
if
she
just
do
what
she
did
in
the
beginning
make
the
flowers
as
good
as
possible
of
their
kind
that
an
awfully
nice
thing
for
a
woman
to
do
raise
flowers
but
there
something
about
this
changing
things
into
other
things
putting
things
together
and
making
queer
new
things
this
dick
creating
harry
give
it
any
name
you
want
it
to
have
it
unsettling
for
a
woman
they
say
claire
a
shark
at
it
but
what
the
good
of
it
if
it
gets
her
what
is
the
good
of
it
anyway
suppose
we
can
produce
new
things
lord
look
at
the
one
ones
we
got
outside
turns
heavens
what
a
noise
the
wind
does
make
around
this
place
now
it
is
not
all
the
wind
tom
edgeworthy
is
trying
to
let
himself
in
at
the
locked
door
their
backs
are
to
i
want
my
you
ca
eat
an
egg
without
salt
i
must
say
i
do
get
claire
lately
i
like
to
have
charlie
emmons
see
her
he
fixed
up
a
lot
of
people
shot
to
pieces
in
the
war
claire
needs
something
to
tone
her
nerves
you
think
it
would
irritate
her
dick
she
probably
get
no
little
entertainment
out
of
it
harry
yes
her
she
would
tom
takes
more
heroic
measures
to
make
himself
heard
at
the
funny
how
the
wind
can
fool
you
now
by
not
looking
around
i
could
imagine
why
i
could
imagine
anything
funny
is
it
about
imagination
and
claire
says
i
have
got
any
dick
it
would
make
an
amusing
drawing
what
the
wind
makes
you
think
is
there
makes
forms
with
his
hands
then
levelling
the
soil
prepared
anthony
lines
with
his
yes
really
quite
jolly
tom
a
moment
of
peering
in
at
them
smiles
goes
harry
you
another
one
of
the
queer
ducks
are
you
come
now
give
me
the
dirt
have
you
queer
ones
really
got
anything
or
do
you
just
put
it
over
on
us
that
you
have
dick
draws
not
saying
anything
eh
well
i
guess
wise
there
if
you
keep
mum
how
are
we
going
to
prove
there
nothing
there
dick
i
do
keep
mum
i
draw
harry
lines
that
do
make
anything
how
can
they
tell
you
anything
well
all
i
ask
is
do
make
claire
queer
claire
a
first
water
good
sport
really
so
do
encourage
her
to
be
queer
dick
trouble
is
if
you
queer
enough
to
be
amusing
it
might
open
the
door
to
queerness
harry
now
do
say
things
like
that
to
claire
dick
i
do
have
to
harry
then
think
she
queer
do
you
queer
as
you
are
you
think
she
queer
i
would
like
to
have
dr
emmons
come
out
a
moment
of
silently
dick
is
having
a
good
time
with
his
you
know
frankly
i
doubt
if
you
a
good
influence
for
claire
dick
his
head
ever
so
oh
i
do
worry
a
bit
about
things
a
husband
might
worry
about
i
suppose
an
intellectual
woman
and
for
all
claire
hate
of
her
ancestors
she
got
the
bug
herself
why
she
has
times
of
boring
into
things
until
she
does
know
you
there
what
do
you
think
i
caught
her
doing
the
other
day
reading
latin
well
a
woman
that
reads
latin
need
worry
a
husband
much
dick
they
said
a
good
deal
in
latin
harry
but
i
was
saying
i
suppose
a
woman
who
lives
a
good
deal
in
her
mind
never
does
have
much
well
what
you
might
call
passion
the
word
as
if
it
should
be
used
brows
knitted
is
looking
ahead
does
not
face
turning
to
him
with
a
i
suppose
you
know
pretty
much
all
there
is
to
know
about
women
dick
perhaps
one
or
two
details
have
escaped
me
harry
well
for
that
matter
you
might
know
all
there
is
to
know
about
women
and
not
know
much
about
claire
but
now
about
not
want
to
say
passion
oh
feeling
claire
has
a
certain
well
a
certain
dick
irony
harry
which
is
really
more
more
dick
more
fetching
perhaps
harry
yes
than
the
thing
itself
but
of
course
you
would
have
much
of
a
thing
that
you
have
irony
about
dick
oh
would
you
i
mean
a
man
might
harry
i
like
to
talk
to
edgeworth
about
claire
but
it
not
easy
to
talk
to
tom
about
claire
or
to
claire
about
tom
dick
they
very
old
friends
are
they
harry
why
yes
they
are
though
they
not
been
together
much
of
late
years
edgeworthy
always
going
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
to
meditate
about
something
i
must
say
i
do
get
it
if
you
have
a
place
the
place
for
you
to
be
and
he
did
have
a
place
best
kind
of
family
connections
and
it
was
a
very
good
business
his
father
left
him
publishing
business
in
good
shape
too
when
old
edgeworthy
died
i
would
call
tom
a
great
success
in
life
but
claire
does
listen
to
what
he
says
dick
yes
i
noticed
that
harry
so
i
like
to
get
him
to
tell
her
to
quit
this
queer
business
of
making
things
grow
that
never
grew
before
dick
but
are
you
sure
that
what
he
would
tell
her
is
he
in
the
same
business
himself
harry
why
he
does
raise
anything
tom
again
at
the
dick
anyway
i
think
he
might
have
some
idea
that
we
ca
very
well
reach
each
other
harry
damn
nonsense
what
have
we
got
intelligence
for
dick
to
let
each
other
alone
i
suppose
only
we
have
enough
to
do
it
tom
now
knocking
on
the
door
with
a
harry
turns
decides
to
be
too
intelligent
to
harry
do
tell
me
i
getting
nerves
but
the
way
some
of
you
people
talk
is
enough
to
make
even
an
aviator
jumpy
ca
reach
each
other
then
we
fools
if
i
here
and
you
there
why
ca
we
reach
each
other
dick
because
i
am
i
and
you
are
you
harry
no
wonder
your
drawing
queer
a
man
who
ca
reach
another
man
tom
reaches
them
by
pointing
the
revolver
in
the
air
and
firing
dick
his
hand
into
the
harry
to
one
side
fearfully
looks
tom
a
pleased
smile
to
see
he
at
last
has
their
attention
moves
the
handle
to
indicate
he
would
be
glad
to
come
harry
why
it
tom
what
the
to
the
he
locked
out
and
claire
got
the
key
to
the
inner
door
tries
and
locked
in
to
see
her
in
claire
claire
to
the
outer
claire
got
the
key
and
i
ca
get
to
claire
a
futile
attempt
at
getting
the
door
open
without
a
key
goes
back
to
inner
door
peers
claire
are
you
there
did
you
hear
the
revolver
has
she
gone
down
the
cellar
the
bolted
well
i
love
the
way
she
keeps
people
locked
out
dick
and
in
harry
angry
shouting
at
the
did
you
hear
the
revolver
tom
awfully
sorry
old
man
but
astonishment
dick
he
ca
hear
me
tom
with
the
revolver
to
get
their
attention
makes
a
gesture
of
inquiry
with
no
no
no
is
he
asking
if
he
shall
shoot
himself
his
head
oh
no
no
um
dick
hardly
seems
a
man
would
shoot
himself
because
he
ca
get
to
his
breakfast
harry
i
coming
to
believe
people
would
do
anything
tom
making
another
inquiry
with
the
no
not
here
do
shoot
yourself
hard
to
get
the
word
yourself
i
mean
do
dick
it
ridiculous
that
you
ca
make
a
man
understand
you
when
he
looks
right
at
you
like
that
back
tom
read
my
lips
lips
i
saying
oh
damn
where
is
claire
all
right
i
explain
it
with
motions
we
wanted
the
salt
over
it
to
and
claire
would
let
us
go
out
for
it
on
account
of
the
temperature
salt
temperature
his
to
the
door
violent
motion
of
shaking
in
but
no
his
no
salt
then
takes
the
thermometer
a
flower
pot
holds
them
up
tom
on
account
of
the
temperature
tom
not
getting
oh
well
what
can
you
do
when
a
man
do
a
thing
tom
to
be
preparing
the
revolver
for
harry
on
the
inner
claire
do
you
want
tom
to
shoot
himself
he
looks
in
there
the
lifts
and
claire
comes
claire
why
what
is
tom
doing
out
there
with
a
revolver
harry
he
is
about
to
shoot
himself
because
you
locked
him
out
from
his
breakfast
claire
he
must
know
more
interesting
ways
of
destroying
himself
tom
good
morning
his
side
of
the
tom
and
smiles
is
it
strange
our
being
in
here
and
he
being
out
there
harry
claire
have
you
no
ideas
of
hospitality
let
him
in
claire
in
perhaps
that
is
hospitality
harry
well
whatever
hospitality
is
what
is
out
there
is
snow
and
wind
and
our
guest
who
was
asked
to
come
here
for
his
breakfast
to
think
a
man
has
to
things
claire
i
going
to
let
him
in
though
i
like
his
looks
out
there
takes
the
key
from
her
harry
thank
heaven
the
door
coming
open
somebody
can
go
for
salt
and
we
can
have
our
eggs
claire
and
open
the
door
again
to
let
the
salt
in
no
if
you
insist
on
salt
tell
tom
now
to
go
back
and
get
it
it
a
stormy
morning
and
there
be
just
one
opening
of
the
door
harry
how
can
we
tell
him
what
we
ca
make
him
hear
and
why
does
he
think
we
holding
this
conversation
instead
of
letting
him
in
claire
it
would
be
interesting
to
know
i
wonder
if
he
tell
us
harry
claire
is
this
any
time
to
wonder
anything
claire
give
up
the
idea
of
salt
for
your
egg
and
i
let
him
in
up
the
key
to
to
indicate
that
for
her
part
she
is
quite
ready
to
let
him
harry
i
want
my
egg
claire
then
ask
him
to
bring
the
salt
it
quite
simple
harry
through
another
pantomime
with
the
and
the
missing
claire
standing
down
cellar
harry
all
the
while
less
amiable
explains
with
thermometer
and
that
there
can
only
be
one
opening
of
the
tom
interested
but
unenlightened
but
suddenly
he
smiles
nods
harry
well
thank
heaven
that
over
claire
on
the
top
it
was
all
so
queer
he
locked
out
on
his
side
of
the
door
you
locked
in
on
yours
looking
right
at
each
other
and
harry
and
me
trying
to
tell
him
to
kindly
fetch
the
salt
claire
yes
harry
dick
well
i
did
do
so
bad
a
job
did
i
quite
an
idea
explaining
our
situation
with
the
thermometer
and
the
that
was
really
an
apology
for
keeping
him
out
there
heaven
knows
some
explanation
was
in
order
is
watching
and
tom
now
there
he
is
claire
and
probably
pretty
well
fed
up
with
the
weather
claire
to
the
door
stops
before
it
she
tom
at
each
other
through
the
glass
then
she
lets
him
tom
and
now
i
am
in
for
a
time
it
seemed
i
was
not
to
be
in
but
after
i
got
the
idea
that
you
were
keeping
me
out
there
to
see
if
i
could
get
the
idea
it
would
be
too
humiliating
for
a
wall
of
glass
to
keep
one
from
understanding
it
from
his
so
there
the
other
thermometer
where
do
you
want
it
claire
claire
and
where
the
pepper
tom
it
on
the
and
here
the
pepper
harry
pepper
tom
when
claire
sneezed
i
knew
claire
yes
i
knew
if
i
sneezed
you
would
bring
the
pepper
tom
funny
how
one
always
remembers
the
salt
but
the
pepper
gets
overlooked
in
preparations
and
what
is
an
egg
without
pepper
harry
there
your
egg
edgeworth
to
it
on
the
claire
decided
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
smash
everything
so
she
began
with
your
egg
tom
at
his
the
idea
of
smashing
everything
is
really
more
intriguing
than
an
egg
harry
nice
that
you
feel
that
way
about
it
claire
tom
you
want
to
hear
something
amusing
i
married
harry
because
i
thought
he
would
smash
something
harry
well
that
was
an
error
in
judgment
claire
i
such
a
naive
trusting
person
harry
claire
him
a
surprised
look
continues
such
a
guileless
soul
that
i
thought
flying
would
do
something
to
a
man
but
it
did
take
us
out
we
just
took
it
in
tom
it
only
our
own
spirit
can
take
us
out
harry
whatever
you
mean
by
out
claire
looking
intently
tom
considering
but
our
own
spirit
is
not
something
on
the
loose
mine
is
it
has
something
to
do
with
what
i
do
to
fly
to
be
free
in
air
to
look
from
above
on
the
world
of
all
my
days
be
where
man
has
never
been
yes
would
you
think
the
spirit
could
get
the
idea
the
earth
grows
smaller
i
am
leaving
what
are
they
running
around
down
there
why
do
they
run
around
down
there
houses
houses
are
funny
lines
and
slants
houses
are
vanishing
slants
i
am
alone
can
i
breathe
this
rarer
air
shall
i
go
higher
shall
i
go
too
high
i
am
loose
i
am
out
but
no
man
flew
and
returned
to
earth
the
man
who
left
it
harry
and
jolly
well
likely
not
to
have
returned
at
all
if
he
had
those
flighty
notions
while
operating
a
machine
claire
oh
harry
lightly
ca
you
see
it
would
be
better
not
to
have
returned
than
to
return
the
man
who
left
it
harry
i
have
some
regard
for
human
life
claire
why
no
i
am
the
one
who
has
the
regard
for
human
life
that
was
why
i
swiftly
divorced
my
artist
and
married
the
man
of
flight
but
i
merely
passed
from
a
artist
to
a
dick
aviator
harry
speaking
of
your
artist
as
you
romantically
call
your
first
blunder
is
his
daughter
and
yours
due
here
claire
i
knew
something
was
disturbing
me
elizabeth
a
daughter
is
being
delivered
unto
me
this
morning
i
have
a
feeling
it
will
be
more
painful
than
the
original
delivery
she
has
been
as
they
quaintly
say
educated
prepared
for
her
place
in
life
harry
and
fortunately
claire
has
a
sister
who
is
willing
to
give
her
young
niece
that
place
claire
the
idea
of
giving
anyone
a
place
in
life
harry
yes
the
very
idea
claire
yes
often
the
mocking
thing
gives
true
expression
to
what
lies
sombrely
in
the
war
there
was
another
gorgeous
chance
harry
chance
for
what
i
call
you
claire
i
ask
you
to
say
what
you
mean
claire
i
do
know
precisely
if
i
did
there
be
no
use
saying
it
harry
exclamation
she
turns
tom
tom
the
only
thing
left
worth
saying
is
the
thing
we
say
harry
help
claire
yes
but
the
war
did
help
oh
it
was
a
stunning
chance
but
fast
as
we
could
scuttled
right
back
to
the
trim
little
thing
we
been
shocked
out
of
harry
you
bet
we
did
showing
our
good
sense
claire
showing
our
incapacity
for
madness
harry
oh
come
now
claire
snap
out
of
it
you
not
really
trying
to
say
that
capacity
for
madness
is
a
good
thing
to
have
claire
simple
why
yes
of
course
dick
but
i
should
say
the
war
did
leave
enough
madness
to
give
you
a
gleam
of
hope
claire
not
the
madness
that
breaks
through
and
it
was
a
stunning
chance
mankind
massed
to
kill
we
have
failed
we
are
through
we
will
destroy
break
this
up
it
ca
go
farther
in
the
air
above
in
the
sea
below
it
is
to
kill
all
we
had
thought
we
were
we
are
we
were
shut
in
with
what
was
so
is
there
one
ounce
of
energy
has
not
gone
to
this
killing
is
there
one
love
not
torn
in
two
throw
it
in
now
ready
break
up
push
harder
break
up
and
then
and
then
but
we
did
say
then
the
spirit
did
take
the
tip
harry
claire
come
now
to
the
others
for
let
talk
of
something
else
claire
plants
do
it
the
big
leap
it
called
explode
their
species
because
something
in
them
knows
they
gone
as
far
as
they
can
go
something
in
them
knows
they
shut
in
to
just
that
so
go
mad
that
life
may
not
be
prisoned
break
themselves
up
into
crazy
things
into
lesser
things
and
from
the
pieces
may
come
one
sliver
of
life
with
vitality
to
find
the
future
how
beautiful
how
brave
tom
if
he
would
call
her
from
too
far
or
would
let
her
know
he
has
gone
with
claire
claire
eyes
turning
to
why
should
we
mind
lying
under
the
earth
we
who
have
no
such
initiative
no
proud
madness
why
think
it
death
to
lie
under
life
so
flexible
so
ruthless
and
anthony
the
door
of
the
inner
miss
claire
claire
an
yes
goes
with
him
as
they
disappear
his
voice
me
now
want
those
violets
bedded
harry
oh
this
has
got
to
i
got
to
put
a
stop
to
it
some
way
why
claire
used
to
be
the
best
sport
a
man
ever
played
around
with
i
ca
stand
it
to
see
her
getting
hysterical
tom
that
was
not
hysterical
harry
what
was
it
then
i
want
to
know
tom
it
was
a
look
harry
oh
i
might
have
known
i
get
no
help
from
either
of
you
even
you
edgeworthy
much
as
she
thinks
of
you
and
fine
sort
as
i
no
doubt
you
are
you
doing
claire
no
good
encouraging
her
in
these
queer
ways
tom
i
could
change
claire
if
i
would
harry
and
would
if
you
could
tom
no
but
you
do
have
to
worry
about
me
i
going
away
in
a
day
or
two
and
i
shall
not
be
back
harry
trouble
with
you
is
it
makes
little
difference
whether
here
or
away
just
the
fact
of
your
existence
does
encourage
claire
in
this
this
way
she
going
tom
a
but
you
would
ask
me
to
go
so
far
as
to
stop
my
existence
though
i
would
do
that
for
claire
if
it
were
the
way
to
help
her
harry
by
jove
you
say
that
as
if
you
meant
it
tom
do
you
think
i
would
say
anything
about
claire
i
did
mean
harry
you
think
a
lot
of
her
do
you
tom
you
do
mean
laugh
letting
him
say
that
you
in
love
with
claire
tom
in
love
oh
that
much
too
easy
certainly
i
do
love
claire
harry
well
you
a
cool
one
tom
let
her
be
herself
ca
you
see
she
troubled
harry
well
what
is
there
to
trouble
claire
now
i
ask
you
it
seems
to
me
she
has
everything
tom
she
left
so
open
too
exposed
harry
please
do
be
annoyed
with
me
i
doing
my
best
at
saying
it
you
see
claire
is
hardened
into
one
of
those
forms
she
talks
about
too
aware
always
pulled
toward
what
could
be
tormented
by
the
lost
adventure
harry
well
there
danger
in
all
that
of
course
there
danger
tom
but
you
ca
help
that
harry
claire
was
the
best
fun
a
woman
could
be
is
yet
at
times
tom
let
her
be
at
times
as
much
as
she
can
and
will
she
does
need
that
do
keep
her
from
it
by
making
her
feel
you
holding
her
in
it
above
all
do
try
to
stop
what
she
doing
here
if
she
can
do
it
with
plants
perhaps
she
wo
have
to
do
it
with
herself
harry
do
what
tom
after
a
break
up
what
exists
open
the
door
to
destruction
in
the
hope
of
a
door
on
the
far
side
of
destruction
harry
well
you
give
me
the
willies
around
in
irritation
troubled
anthony
is
passing
through
with
a
anthony
have
any
arrangements
been
made
about
miss
claire
daughter
anthony
i
have
heard
of
any
arrangements
harry
well
she
have
to
have
some
heat
in
her
room
we
ca
all
live
out
here
anthony
indeed
you
can
not
it
is
not
good
for
the
plants
harry
i
going
where
i
can
dick
but
fascinated
by
the
you
think
there
is
a
door
on
the
hinter
side
of
destruction
tom
how
can
one
tell
where
a
door
may
be
one
thing
i
want
to
say
to
you
for
it
is
about
you
dick
not
with
his
usual
impersonal
i
do
think
claire
should
have
any
door
closed
to
her
you
know
i
think
what
i
mean
and
perhaps
you
can
guess
how
it
hurts
to
say
it
whether
it
mere
escape
within
rather
shameful
escape
within
or
the
wild
hope
of
that
door
through
it
all
be
good
to
her
a
difficult
moment
going
away
for
ever
is
like
dying
so
one
can
say
things
dick
why
do
you
do
it
go
away
for
ever
tom
i
have
succeeded
here
dick
but
you
tried
the
going
away
before
tom
never
knowing
i
would
not
come
back
so
that
was
going
away
my
hope
is
that
this
will
be
like
looking
at
life
from
outside
life
dick
but
then
you
not
be
in
it
tom
i
have
been
able
to
look
at
it
while
in
it
dick
is
it
more
important
to
be
in
it
than
to
look
at
it
tom
not
what
i
mean
by
look
dick
it
hard
for
me
to
conceive
of
loving
claire
and
going
away
from
her
for
ever
tom
perhaps
it
harder
to
do
than
to
conceive
of
dick
then
why
do
it
tom
it
my
only
way
of
keeping
her
dick
i
afraid
i
like
harry
now
i
do
get
you
tom
i
suppose
not
your
way
is
different
calm
with
sadness
not
with
but
i
shall
have
her
longer
and
from
deeper
dick
i
know
that
tom
though
i
miss
much
much
tom
around
to
see
if
anyone
is
coming
to
answer
it
then
goes
to
the
yes
see
if
i
can
get
her
dick
claire
daughter
has
arrived
in
the
inner
room
returns
to
i
do
see
her
a
glimpse
of
anthony
off
oh
anthony
where
miss
claire
her
daughter
has
arrived
anthony
she
working
at
something
very
important
in
her
experiments
dick
but
is
her
daughter
one
of
her
experiments
anthony
a
baffled
her
daughter
is
finished
tom
the
sorry
but
i
ca
get
to
claire
she
appears
to
have
gone
below
anthony
the
i
did
speak
to
anthony
but
he
says
that
claire
is
working
at
one
of
her
experiments
and
that
her
daughter
is
finished
i
do
know
how
to
make
her
hear
i
took
the
revolver
back
to
the
house
anyway
you
will
remember
claire
does
answer
the
revolver
i
hate
to
reach
claire
when
she
want
to
be
reached
why
of
course
a
daughter
is
very
important
but
oh
that
too
bad
down
the
he
says
the
feelings
are
hurt
is
that
annoying
pounds
on
the
then
with
the
other
hand
anthony
a
gentle
smile
for
the
gentle
tapping
nods
approval
as
tom
to
the
she
does
come
up
indeed
i
did
with
both
fists
sorry
anthony
please
you
wo
try
again
to
disturb
miss
claire
will
you
dick
her
daughter
is
here
anthony
she
has
seen
her
daughter
for
a
year
anthony
well
if
she
got
along
without
a
mother
for
a
year
back
to
his
dick
anthony
plants
are
queer
perhaps
it
to
do
it
with
pencil
tom
or
with
pure
thought
things
that
grow
in
the
earth
tom
i
suppose
because
we
grew
in
the
earth
dick
i
always
shocked
to
find
myself
in
agreement
with
harry
but
i
too
am
worried
about
claire
and
this
at
the
tom
it
her
best
chance
dick
do
you
hate
to
go
away
to
india
for
ever
leaving
future
uncertain
tom
you
cruel
now
and
you
knew
that
you
were
being
cruel
dick
yes
i
like
the
lines
of
your
face
when
you
suffer
tom
the
lines
of
yours
when
you
causing
suffering
i
do
like
them
dick
perhaps
that
your
limitation
tom
i
grant
you
it
may
be
are
i
had
an
odd
feeling
that
you
and
i
sat
here
once
before
long
ago
and
that
we
were
plants
and
you
were
a
beautiful
plant
and
i
i
was
a
very
ugly
plant
i
confess
it
surprised
me
finding
myself
so
ugly
a
plant
young
girl
is
seen
harry
the
door
open
for
her
and
elizabeth
harry
there
heat
here
and
two
of
your
mother
friends
mr
demming
richard
demming
the
artist
and
i
think
you
and
mr
edgeworthy
are
old
friends
elizabeth
forward
she
is
the
creditable
young
american
well
built
poised
so
sound
an
expression
of
the
usual
as
to
be
able
to
meet
the
world
with
assurance
assurance
which
training
has
made
rather
graceful
she
is
about
seventeen
and
mature
you
feel
solid
things
behind
tom
i
knew
you
when
you
were
a
baby
you
used
to
kick
a
great
deal
then
elizabeth
with
and
scream
i
have
a
doubt
but
i
stopped
that
one
does
does
one
and
it
was
you
who
gave
me
the
idol
tom
proselytizing
i
afraid
elizabeth
i
beg
oh
laughing
i
she
i
dressed
the
idol
up

difference

your

better
than
your
mother
elizabeth
but
you
see
i
do
do
anything
interesting
so
i
have
to
have
good
manners

leaving
the
impression

is
a
certain
superiority
in
not
doing
anything
interesting
turning
cordially

my
father

an
artist
dick

back
down
the
harry
claire
she
sits
on

top
step

a
long
pause
in
which
he

last
few
months

know
miss
lane
took
us
to
europe
tom
and
how
did
you
like
europe

i
thought
it
was
awfully
amusing
all
the
girls
were
quite
mad
about
europe
of
course
i
glad
i
an
american
claire
why
elizabeth
why
mother
of
course

is
glad
one

an
american
all
the
girls
claire
o
h
moan
under
the
elizabeth
why
mother
are
you
well
harry
your
mother
has
been
working
pretty
hard
at
all
this
elizabeth
oh
i
do
so
want
to
know
all
about
it
perhaps
i
can
help
you
i
think
it
just
awfully
amusing
that
you
doing
something
one
does
nowadays
does
one
if
you
know
what
i
mean
it
was
the
war
was
it
made
it
the
thing
to
do
something
dick
and
you
thought
claire
that
the
war
was
lost
elizabeth
the
lost
capable
fancy
our
losing
a
war
miss
lane
says
we
should
give
she
says
we
should
each
do
some
expressive
thing
you
know
what
i
mean
and
that
this
is
the
of
the
age
of
course
one
own
kind
of
thing
like
mother
growing
flowers
claire
you
think
that
is
one
own
kind
of
thing
elizabeth
why
of
course
i
do
mother
and
so
does
miss
lane
all
the
girls
claire
her
head
as
if
to
get
something
elizabeth
what
is
it
mother
claire
a
fly
shut
up
in
my
ear
the
girls
elizabeth
mother
was
always
so
amusing
so
if
you
know
what
i
mean
vacations
i
lived
mostly
with
aunt
adelaide
you
know
claire
my
sister
who
is
fitted
to
rear
children
harry
well
somebody
has
to
do
it
elizabeth
and
i
do
love
aunt
adelaide
but
i
think
its
going
to
be
awfully
amusing
to
be
around
with
mother
now
and
help
her
with
her
work
help
do
some
useful
beautiful
thing
claire
i
am
not
doing
any
useful
beautiful
thing
elizabeth
oh
but
you
are
mother
of
course
you
are
miss
lane
says
so
she
says
it
is
your
splendid
heritage
gives
you
this
impulse
to
do
a
beautiful
thing
for
the
race
she
says
you
are
doing
in
your
way
what
the
great
teachers
and
preachers
behind
you
did
in
theirs
claire
is
good
for
little
well
all
i
can
say
is
miss
lane
is
stung
elizabeth
mother
what
a
thing
to
say
of
miss
lane
this
slipping
into
more
of
a
little
girl
oh
she
gave
me
a
spiel
one
day
about
living
up
to
the
men
i
come
from
claire
and
regards
her
claire
you
do
it
elizabeth
elizabeth
well
i
do
know
quite
a
job
i
say
of
course
have
to
do
it
in
my
way
i
not
going
to
teach
or
preach
or
be
a
stuffy
person
but
now
that
here
becomes
the
product
of
a
superior
values
have
shifted
and
such
sensitive
new
things
have
been
liberated
in
the
world
claire
do
use
those
words
elizabeth
why
why
not
claire
because
you
do
know
what
they
mean
elizabeth
why
of
course
i
know
what
they
mean
claire
you
stepping
on
the
plants
harry
your
mother
has
been
working
awfully
hard
at
all
this
elizabeth
well
now
that
i
here
you
let
me
help
you
wo
you
mother
claire
for
you
need
bother
elizabeth
but
i
to
help
add
to
the
wealth
of
the
world
claire
will
you
please
get
it
out
of
your
head
that
i
am
adding
to
the
wealth
of
the
world
elizabeth
but
mother
of
course
you
are
to
produce
a
new
and
better
kind
of
plant
claire
they
may
be
new
i
do
give
a
damn
whether
they
better
elizabeth
but
but
what
are
they
then
claire
if
choked
out
of
they
different
elizabeth
a
minute
then
laughs
but
what
the
use
of
making
them
different
if
they
are
better
harry
a
good
square
question
claire
why
do
you
answer
it
claire
i
do
have
to
answer
it
harry
why
not
give
the
girl
a
fair
show
you
never
have
you
know
since
she
interested
why
not
tell
her
what
it
is
you
doing
claire
she
is
not
interested
elizabeth
but
i
am
mother
indeed
i
am
i
do
want
awfully
to
understand
what
you
are
doing
and
help
you
claire
you
ca
help
me
elizabeth
harry
why
not
let
her
try
claire
why
do
you
ask
me
to
do
that
this
is
my
own
thing
why
do
you
make
me
feel
i
should
elizabeth
i
will
be
good
to
you
elizabeth
we
go
around
together
i
have
done
it
but
you
see
we
do
gay
things
i
have
a
lot
of
beaus
around
for
you
anything
else
not
this
is
not
this
elizabeth
as
you
like
mother
of
course
i
just
would
have
been
so
glad
to
to
share
the
thing
that
interests
you
borne
with
good
breeding
and
a
harry
claire
says
can
you
claire
is
looking
elizabeth
yes
i
will
try
tom
i
do
think
so
as
claire
says
anything
else
elizabeth
why
of
course
i
do
at
all
want
to
intrude
harry
it
do
claire
good
to
take
someone
in
to
get
down
to
brass
tacks
and
actually
say
what
she
driving
at
claire
oh
but
yes
i
will
try
try
but
no
words
come
when
you
come
to
say
it
it
not
one
would
rather
not
nail
it
to
a
cross
of
words
with
brass
tacks
harry
but
i
want
to
see
you
put
things
into
words
claire
and
realize
just
where
you
are
claire
you
think
that
a
good
idea
elizabeth
her
manner
of
holding
the
world
capably
in
her
now
let
talk
of
something
else
i
had
the
least
idea
of
making
mother
feel
badly
claire
no
we
go
on
though
i
do
know
where
we
end
i
ca
answer
for
that
these
plants
perhaps
they
are
less
beautiful
less
sound
than
the
plants
from
which
they
diverged
but
they
have
found
otherness
a
little
if
you
know
what
i
mean
tom
claire
stop
this
harry
this
is
wrong
claire
no
i
going
on
they
have
been
shocked
out
of
what
they
were
into
something
they
were
not
they
broken
from
the
forms
in
which
they
found
themselves
they
are
alien
outside
it
outside
if
you
know
what
i
mean
elizabeth
shocked
from
what
she
but
of
course
the
object
of
it
all
is
to
make
them
better
plants
otherwise
what
would
be
the
sense
of
doing
it
claire
reached
elizabeth
out
there
it
with
her
lies
all
that
not
been
touched
lies
life
that
waits
back
here
the
old
pattern
done
again
again
and
again
so
long
done
it
does
even
know
itself
for
a
pattern
in
immensity
but
this
has
invaded
crept
a
little
way
into
what
was
strange
lines
in
life
unused
and
when
you
make
a
pattern
new
you
know
a
pattern
made
with
life
and
then
you
know
that
anything
may
be
if
only
you
know
how
to
reach
it
has
taken
form
not
easily
but
with
great
struggle
between
feeling
and
harry
now
i
begin
to
get
you
claire
i
never
knew
before
why
you
called
it
the
edge
vine
claire
i
should
destroy
the
edge
vine
it
is
over
the
edge
running
back
to
the
girls
it
a
little
afraid
of
miss
lane
sombrely
at
you
are
out
but
you
are
not
alive
elizabeth
why
it
looks
all
right
mother
claire
did
carry
life
with
it
from
the
life
it
left
dick
you
know
what
i
mean
at
least
you
ought
to
ruthless
way
of
not
letting
anyone
feelings
stand
in
the
way
of
then
destroy
it
for
me
it
hard
to
do
it
with
the
hands
that
made
it
dick
but
what
the
point
in
destroying
it
claire
claire
i
told
you
it
can
not
create
dick
but
you
say
you
can
go
on
producing
it
and
it
interesting
in
form
claire
and
you
think
i
stop
with
that
be
shut
in
with
different
life
that
ca
creep
on
trying
to
put
destroying
hands
upon
it
hard
to
get
past
what
we
done
our
own
dead
things
block
the
way
tom
but
you
doing
it
this
next
time
claire
to
the
inner
in
there
claire
to
that
i
not
sure
tom
but
you
told
me
breath
of
life
has
already
produced
itself
that
show
it
has
brought
life
from
the
life
it
left
claire
but
timidly
rather
wistfully
a
little
homesick
if
it
is
less
sure
this
time
then
it
is
going
back
to
miss
lane
but
if
the
pattern
clearer
now
then
it
has
made
friends
of
life
that
waits
know
elizabeth
you
know
something
tells
me
this
is
claire
the
ancestors
are
tuning
up
elizabeth
i
do
know
what
you
mean
by
that
mother
but
claire
but
we
will
now
sing
my
god
to
thee
nearer
to
elizabeth
breaking
well
i
do
care
of
course
you
can
make
fun
at
me
but
something
does
tell
me
this
is
wrong
to
do
what
what
dick
what
god
did
elizabeth
well
yes
unless
you
do
it
to
make
them
better
to
it
just
to
do
it
that
does
seem
right
to
me
claire
to
you
and
that
all
you
know
of
adventure
and
of
anguish
do
you
know
it
is
you
world
of
which
so
true
a
flower
makes
me
have
to
leave
you
there
to
hold
the
door
shut
because
you
young
and
of
a
gayer
world
you
think
i
ca
them
those
old
men
do
you
know
why
you
so
sure
of
yourself
because
you
ca
ca
feel
the
limitless
out
there
a
sea
just
over
the
hill
i
will
not
stay
with
you
her
hands
in
the
earth
around
the
edge
vine
but
suddenly
steps
back
from
it
as
she
had
elizabeth
and
i
will
not
stay
with
grasps
it
as
we
grasp
what
we
would
kill
is
trying
to
pull
it
up
they
all
step
forward
in
horror
anthony
is
drawn
in
by
this
harm
to
the
anthony
miss
claire
miss
claire
the
work
of
years
claire
may
only
make
a
prison
harry
is
trying
to
stop
you
think
i
too
will
die
on
the
edge
has
thrown
him
away
is
now
struggling
with
the
why
did
i
make
you
to
get
past
you
she
twists
oh
yes
i
know
you
have
thorns
the
edge
vine
should
have
thorns
a
long
tremendous
pull
for
deep
roots
she
has
it
up
as
she
holds
the
torn
oh
i
have
loved
you
so
you
took
me
where
i
had
been
elizabeth
has
been
looking
on
with
a
certain
practical
well
i
say
it
would
be
better
not
to
go
there
claire
now
i
know
what
you
are
for
her
arm
back
to
elizabeth
the
edge
harry
it
from
claire
are
you
mad
claire
no
i
not
mad
i
too
sane
elizabeth
the
words
come
from
mighty
to
think
that
object
ever
moved
my
belly
and
sucked
my
breast
elizabeth
her
face
as
if
harry
elizabeth
claire
this
is
atrocious
you
cruel
elizabeth
the
door
and
out
after
an
irresolute
moment
in
which
he
looks
claire
tom
dick
anthony
bear
to
go
he
stoops
to
take
the
edge
vine
from
the
stops
him
he
goes
into
the
inner
claire
the
edge
vine
out
of
her
way
drawing
deep
breaths
how
good
i
feel
light
movement
as
if
she
could
read
me
something
tom
dear
or
say
something
pleasant
about
god
but
be
very
careful
what
you
say
about
him
i
have
a
feeling
he
not
far
off
curtain
act
ii
afternoon
of
the
following
claire
alone
in
the
tower
a
tower
which
is
thought
to
be
round
but
does
not
complete
the
circle
the
back
is
curved
then
jagged
lines
break
from
that
and
the
front
is
a
queer
bulging
window
in
a
curve
that
leans
the
whole
structure
is
as
if
given
a
twist
by
some
terrific
force
like
something
wrong
it
is
lighted
by
an
watchman
lantern
hanging
from
the
ceiling
the
innumerable
pricks
and
slits
in
the
metal
throw
a
marvellous
pattern
on
the
curved
wall
like
some
masonry
that
has
been
there
are
no
windows
at
back
and
there
is
no
door
save
an
opening
in
the
floor
the
delicately
distorted
rail
of
a
spiral
staircase
winds
up
from
claire
seen
through
the
huge
ominous
window
as
if
shut
into
the
tower
she
is
lying
on
a
seat
at
the
back
looking
at
a
book
of
drawings
to
do
this
she
has
left
the
door
of
her
lantern
a
little
open
and
her
own
face
is
clearly
seen
a
door
is
heard
opening
below
laughing
voices
claire
not
adelaide
coming
dear
dear
why
do
they
make
such
twisting
steps
harry
take
your
time
most
up
now
head
appears
he
looks
making
it
all
right
adelaide
i
ca
tell
yet
no
i
do
think
so
harry
back
a
hand
for
the
last
lap
is
the
bad
lap
adelaide
up
and
occupied
with
getting
her
harry
since
you
would
come
down
claire
we
thought
we
come
up
adelaide
claire
not
greet
i
sorry
to
intrude
but
i
have
to
see
you
claire
there
are
things
to
be
arranged
claire
nothing
about
arrangements
adelaide
the
tower
an
unsympathetic
eye
goes
from
the
curves
to
the
lines
which
diverge
then
she
looks
from
the
well
at
least
you
have
a
view
harry
this
is
the
first
time
you
been
up
here
adelaide
yes
in
the
five
years
you
had
the
house
i
was
never
asked
up
here
before
claire
you
were
asked
up
here
now
adelaide
harry
asked
me
claire
it
is
harry
tower
but
never
mind
since
you
do
like
it
it
all
right
adelaide
eyes
again
rebuking
the
irregularities
of
the
no
i
confess
i
do
not
care
for
it
a
round
tower
should
go
on
being
round
harry
claire
calls
this
the
thwarted
tower
she
bought
the
house
because
of
it
over
and
sitting
by
her
his
hand
on
her
did
you
old
girl
she
says
she
like
to
have
known
the
architect
adelaide
probably
a
tiresome
person
too
incompetent
to
make
a
perfect
tower
claire
well
now
he
disposed
of
what
next
adelaide
down
in
a
manner
of
capably
opening
a
next
elizabeth
and
you
claire
just
what
is
the
matter
with
elizabeth
claire
voice
is
cool
even
as
if
herself
is
not
really
engaged
by
nothing
is
the
matter
with
her
she
is
a
tower
that
is
a
tower
adelaide
well
is
that
anything
against
her
claire
she
just
like
one
of
her
father
portraits
they
never
interested
me
nor
does
she
at
the
drawings
which
do
interest
adelaide
a
mother
can
not
cast
off
her
own
child
simply
because
she
does
not
interest
her
claire
instant
raising
cool
eyes
adelaide
why
ca
she
adelaide
because
it
would
be
monstrous
claire
and
why
ca
she
be
monstrous
if
she
has
to
be
adelaide
you
do
have
to
be
that
where
i
out
of
patience
with
you
claire
you
are
really
a
particularly
intelligent
competent
person
and
it
time
for
you
to
call
a
halt
to
this
nonsense
and
be
the
woman
you
were
meant
to
be
claire
the
book
up
to
see
another
what
inside
dope
have
you
on
what
i
was
meant
to
be
adelaide
i
know
what
you
came
from
claire
well
is
it
about
time
somebody
got
loose
from
that
what
i
came
from
made
you
so
adelaide
i
see
claire
so
you
being
such
a
tower
of
strength
why
need
i
too
be
imprisoned
in
what
i
came
from
adelaide
it
is
being
imprisoned
right
there
is
where
you
make
your
mistake
claire
who
in
a
tower
in
an
unsuccessful
tower
not
i
go
about
in
the
world
free
busy
happy
among
people
i
have
no
time
to
think
of
myself
claire
no
adelaide
no
my
family
the
things
that
interest
them
from
morning
till
night
it
claire
yes
i
know
you
have
a
large
family
adelaide
five
and
elizabeth
makes
six
adelaide
we
speak
of
elizabeth
later
but
if
you
would
just
get
out
of
yourself
and
enter
into
other
people
lives
claire
then
i
would
become
just
like
you
and
we
should
all
be
just
alike
in
order
to
assure
one
another
that
we
all
just
right
but
since
you
and
harry
and
elizabeth
and
ten
million
other
people
bolster
each
other
up
why
do
you
especially
need
me
adelaide
we
do
need
you
as
much
as
you
need
us
claire
wry
i
never
liked
what
i
needed
harry
i
am
convinced
i
am
the
worst
thing
in
the
world
for
you
claire
claire
a
smile
for
his
tactics
but
shaking
her
afraid
you
not
i
do
know
perhaps
you
are
adelaide
well
what
is
it
you
want
claire
claire
you
would
know
if
i
told
you
adelaide
that
rather
arrogant
harry
yes
take
a
chance
claire
i
have
been
known
to
get
an
idea
and
adelaide
quite
frequently
gets
one
claire
first
resentment
she
has
you
two
feel
very
superior
do
you
adelaide
i
do
think
we
are
the
ones
who
are
feeling
superior
claire
oh
yes
you
are
very
superior
to
what
you
think
is
my
feeling
of
superiority
comparing
my
isolation
with
your
of
humanity
soon
we
will
speak
of
the
beauty
of
common
experiences
of
the
oh
i
could
say
it
all
before
we
come
to
it
harry
adelaide
came
up
here
to
help
you
claire
claire
adelaide
came
up
here
to
lock
me
in
well
she
ca
do
it
adelaide
but
ca
you
see
that
one
may
do
that
to
self
claire
of
this
looks
suddenly
tired
then
well
at
least
i
changed
the
keys
harry
in
bunkum
get
that
our
of
your
head
claire
locked
in
nobody
that
i
know
of
we
all
free
americans
free
as
air
adelaide
i
wish
you
come
and
hear
one
of
mr
morley
sermons
claire
you
very
if
you
think
sermons
are
what
they
used
to
be
claire
and
do
they
still
sing
my
god
to
thee
adelaide
they
do
and
a
noble
old
hymn
it
is
it
would
do
you
no
harm
at
all
to
sing
it
claire
sing
it
to
me
adelaide
i
like
to
hear
you
sing
it
adelaide
it
would
be
sacrilege
to
sing
it
to
you
in
this
mood
claire
oh
i
do
know
i
not
so
sure
god
would
agree
with
you
that
would
be
one
on
you
would
it
adelaide
it
easy
to
feel
one
self
set
apart
claire
no
it
is
adelaide
it
a
new
age
claire
spiritual
values
claire
spiritual
values
her
brooding
so
you
have
pulled
that
up
do
think
i
do
know
what
it
is
you
do
adelaide
well
what
do
i
do
i
sure
i
have
no
idea
what
talking
about
harry
claire
looking
with
intentness
at
what
he
does
not
what
does
she
do
claire
claire
it
rather
clever
what
she
does
snatching
the
phrase
movement
as
if
pulling
something
standing
it
up
between
her
and
the
life
that
there
and
by
saying
it
enough
have
life
we
have
life
we
have
life
very
good
at
one
who
would
really
be
so
are
that
right
this
way
please
i
suppose
is
what
we
mean
by
needing
each
other
all
join
in
the
chorus
is
it
this
is
it
this
is
it
and
anyone
who
wo
join
is
to
be
visited
by
relatives
adelaide
do
you
really
think
that
anything
is
going
on
in
you
adelaide
i
am
not
one
to
hold
myself
up
as
a
perfect
example
of
what
the
human
race
may
be
claire
well
that
good
harry
claire
claire
humility
a
thing
not
just
a
fine
name
for
laziness
harry
well
lord
you
ca
call
adelaide
lazy
claire
she
stays
in
one
place
because
she
has
the
energy
to
go
anywhere
else
adelaide
if
the
last
word
in
absurdity
has
been
said
energy
claire
you
have
any
energy
at
all
adelaide
that
why
you
keep
so
busy
adelaide
claire
nerves
are
in
a
worse
state
than
i
had
realized
claire
so
perhaps
we
better
look
at
blake
drawings
up
the
adelaide
it
would
be
all
right
for
me
to
look
at
blake
drawings
you
better
look
at
the
sistine
madonna
after
she
has
face
a
what
is
it
claire
why
do
you
shut
yourself
out
from
us
claire
i
told
you
because
i
do
not
want
to
be
shut
in
with
you
adelaide
all
of
this
is
not
very
pleasant
for
harry
harry
i
want
claire
to
be
gay
claire
funny
you
should
want
that
unwillingly
a
curious
wistful
did
you
ever
say
a
preposterous
thing
then
go
trailing
after
the
thing
you
said
and
find
it
was
so
preposterous
here
is
the
circle
we
are
a
big
being
gay
it
shoots
little
darts
through
the
circle
and
a
minute
later
gaiety
all
gone
and
you
looking
through
that
little
hole
the
gaiety
left
adelaide
to
her
as
she
is
still
looking
through
that
little
claire
dear
i
wish
i
could
make
you
feel
how
much
i
care
for
you
with
real
you
can
call
me
all
the
names
you
like
dull
commonplace
lazy
that
is
a
new
idea
i
confess
but
the
rest
of
our
family
gone
now
and
the
love
that
used
to
be
there
between
us
all
the
only
place
for
it
now
is
between
you
and
me
you
were
so
much
loved
claire
you
ought
to
try
and
get
away
from
a
world
in
which
you
are
so
much
loved
harry
mother
father
all
of
us
always
loved
claire
best
we
always
loved
claire
queer
gaiety
now
you
got
to
hand
it
to
us
for
that
as
the
children
say
claire
but
eyes
shining
with
a
queer
bright
but
never
one
of
you
once
looked
with
me
through
the
little
pricks
the
gaiety
made
never
one
of
you
once
looked
with
me
at
the
queer
light
that
came
in
through
the
pricks
adelaide
and
ca
you
see
dear
that
it
better
for
us
we
did
and
that
it
would
be
better
for
you
now
if
you
would
just
resolutely
look
somewhere
else
you
must
see
yourself
that
you
have
the
poise
of
people
who
are
held
well
within
the
circle
if
you
choose
to
put
it
that
way
there
something
about
being
in
that
main
body
having
roots
in
the
big
common
experiences
gives
a
calm
which
you
have
missed
that
i
want
you
to
take
elizabeth
forget
yourself
and
claire
i
do
want
calm
but
mine
would
have
to
be
a
calm
i
worked
my
way
to
a
calm
all
prepared
for
me
would
stink
adelaide
i
know
you
have
to
be
yourself
claire
but
i
do
admit
you
have
a
right
to
hurt
other
people
harry
i
think
claire
and
i
had
better
take
a
nice
long
trip
adelaide
now
why
do
you
claire
i
am
taking
a
trip
adelaide
well
harry
is
and
he
like
to
go
and
wants
you
to
go
with
him
go
to
paris
and
get
yourself
some
awfully
clothes
and
have
one
grand
fling
at
the
gay
world
you
really
love
that
claire
and
you
been
awfully
dull
lately
i
think
that
the
whole
trouble
harry
i
think
so
too
adelaide
this
sober
business
of
growing
plants
claire
not
sober
it
mad
adelaide
all
the
more
reason
for
quitting
it
claire
but
madness
that
is
the
only
chance
for
sanity
adelaide
come
come
now
let
not
juggle
words
claire
how
dare
you
say
that
to
me
adelaide
you
who
are
such
a
liar
and
thief
and
whore
with
words
adelaide
her
how
you
harry
of
course
not
claire
you
have
the
most
preposterous
way
of
using
words
claire
i
respect
words
adelaide
well
you
please
respect
me
enough
not
to
dare
use
certain
words
to
me
claire
yes
i
do
dare
i
tired
of
what
you
do
you
and
all
of
you
life
experience
values
calm
sensitive
words
which
raise
their
heads
as
indications
and
you
them
to
decorate
your
stagnant
little
minds
and
think
that
makes
you
and
because
you
have
pulled
that
word
from
the
life
that
grew
it
you
wo
let
one
who
honest
and
aware
and
troubled
try
to
reach
through
to
to
what
she
does
know
is
there
is
moved
excited
as
if
a
cruel
thing
has
been
why
did
you
come
here
adelaide
to
try
and
help
you
but
i
begin
to
fear
i
ca
do
it
pretty
egotistical
to
claim
that
what
so
many
people
are
is
wrong
after
looking
intently
at
adelaide
slowly
smiling
a
little
describes
a
circle
with
deftly
used
hands
makes
a
quick
vicious
break
in
the
circle
which
is
there
in
the
harry
to
her
taking
her
it
getting
close
to
you
were
thinking
of
something
else
claire
when
i
told
you
charlie
emmons
was
coming
to
dinner
her
sure
he
is
a
neurologist
and
i
want
him
to
see
you
i
perfectly
honest
with
you
cards
all
on
the
table
you
know
that
i
hoping
if
you
like
him
and
he
the
best
scout
in
the
world
that
he
can
help
you
hurriedly
against
the
stillness
which
follows
her
look
from
him
to
adelaide
where
she
sees
between
them
an
about
sure
you
need
help
claire
your
nerves
are
a
little
on
the
blink
from
all
you
been
doing
no
use
making
a
mystery
of
it
or
a
tragedy
emmons
is
a
and
naturally
i
want
you
to
get
a
move
on
yourself
and
be
happy
again
claire
has
gone
over
to
the
and
this
neurologist
can
make
me
happy
harry
can
make
you
well
and
then
you
be
happy
adelaide
the
voice
of
now
fixing
it
all
and
i
had
just
an
idea
about
elizabeth
instead
of
working
with
mere
plants
why
not
think
of
elizabeth
as
a
plant
and
claire
has
been
looking
out
of
the
window
now
throws
open
one
of
the
panes
that
swings
out
or
seems
to
and
calls
down
in
great
claire
tom
quick
up
here
i
in
trouble
harry
to
the
that
a
rotten
thing
to
do
claire
you
frightened
him
claire
yes
how
fast
he
can
run
he
was
deep
in
thought
and
i
stabbed
right
through
harry
well
he
be
none
too
pleased
when
he
gets
up
here
and
finds
there
was
no
reason
for
the
stabbing
wait
for
his
footsteps
harry
adelaide
but
stealing
worried
looks
claire
is
looking
fixedly
at
the
place
in
the
floor
tom
running
tom
voice
getting
there
before
he
yes
claire
yes
yes
his
head
what
is
it
claire
once
presenting
him
and
answering
his
my
sister
tom
oh
why
is
that
all
i
mean
how
do
you
do
pardon
i
came
up
rather
hurriedly
harry
if
you
want
to
slap
claire
tom
i
for
one
have
no
objection
claire
adelaide
has
the
most
interesting
idea
tom
she
proposes
that
i
take
elizabeth
and
roll
her
in
the
gutter
just
let
her
lie
there
until
she
breaks
up
into
adelaide
i
do
see
how
even
in
fun
pretty
vulgar
fun
you
can
speak
in
those
terms
of
a
pure
young
girl
i
beginning
to
think
i
had
better
take
elizabeth
claire
oh
i
thought
that
all
along
adelaide
and
i
also
beginning
to
suspect
that
oddity
may
be
just
a
way
of
shifting
responsibility
claire
interested
in
this
now
you
know
that
might
be
adelaide
a
mother
who
does
not
love
her
own
child
you
are
an
unnatural
woman
claire
claire
well
at
least
it
saves
me
from
being
a
natural
one
adelaide
oh
i
know
you
think
you
have
a
great
deal
but
let
me
tell
you
you
missed
a
great
deal
you
never
known
the
faintest
stirring
of
a
mother
love
claire
that
not
true
harry
no
claire
loved
our
boy
claire
i
glad
he
did
live
harry
claire
claire
i
loved
him
why
should
i
want
him
to
live
harry
come
dear
i
sorry
i
spoke
of
him
when
you
not
feeling
well
claire
i
feeling
all
right
because
i
seeing
something
it
does
mean
i
sick
harry
well
let
go
down
now
about
i
should
wonder
if
emmons
were
here
adelaide
is
starting
down
coming
claire
claire
no
harry
but
it
time
to
go
down
for
dinner
claire
i
not
hungry
harry
but
we
have
a
guest
two
guests
adelaide
staying
too
claire
then
you
not
alone
harry
but
i
invited
dr
emmons
to
meet
you
claire
smile
tell
him
i
am
violent
harry
dearest
how
can
you
joke
about
such
things
claire
so
you
do
think
they
serious
harry
no
i
do
not
but
i
want
you
to
come
down
for
dinner
adelaide
come
come
claire
you
know
quite
well
this
is
not
the
sort
of
thing
one
does
claire
why
go
on
saying
one
does
when
you
are
seeing
one
does
tom
will
you
stay
with
me
a
while
i
want
to
purify
the
tower
adelaide
to
harry
fine
time
to
choose
for
a
as
he
is
think
more
of
you
edgeworthy
if
you
refused
to
humour
claire
in
her
adelaide
severe
voice
coming
from
it
is
not
what
she
was
taught
claire
no
it
not
what
i
was
taught
rather
and
perhaps
you
rather
have
your
dinner
tom
no
claire
we
get
something
later
i
want
to
talk
to
you
she
does
not
absurd
that
i
should
feel
bashful
with
you
why
am
i
so
awkward
with
words
when
i
go
to
talk
to
you
tom
the
words
know
they
not
needed
claire
no
they
not
needed
there
something
underneath
an
open
way
down
below
the
way
that
words
can
go
it
is
there
is
it
tom
oh
yes
it
is
there
claire
then
why
do
we
never
go
it
tom
if
we
went
it
it
would
not
be
there
claire
is
that
true
how
terrible
if
that
is
true
tom
not
terrible
wonderful
that
it
should
of
itself
be
there
claire
the
simplicity
that
can
say
i
want
to
go
it
tom
i
lonely
up
on
top
here
is
it
that
i
have
more
faith
than
you
or
is
it
only
that
i
greedier
you
see
you
do
know
reckless
what
you
missing
you
do
know
how
i
could
love
you
tom
do
claire
that
is
how
it
is
between
you
and
me
claire
but
why
ca
it
be
every
way
between
you
and
me
tom
because
we
lose
the
open
way
quality
of
his
denial
shows
how
strong
is
his
feeling
for
with
anyone
else
not
with
you
claire
but
you
are
the
only
one
i
want
the
only
one
all
of
me
wants
tom
i
know
but
that
the
way
it
is
claire
you
cruel
tom
oh
claire
i
trying
so
hard
to
save
it
for
us
is
it
our
beauty
and
our
safeguard
that
underneath
our
separate
lives
no
matter
where
we
may
be
with
what
other
there
is
this
open
way
between
us
that
so
much
more
than
anything
we
could
bring
to
being
claire
perhaps
but
it
different
with
me
i
not
all
spirit
tom
hand
on
dear
claire
no
do
touch
me
since
you
going
away
for
always
head
just
moves
india
is
just
another
country
but
there
are
undiscovered
countries
tom
yes
but
we
are
so
feeble
we
have
to
reach
our
country
through
the
actual
country
lying
nearest
do
you
do
that
yourself
claire
reach
your
country
through
the
plants
country
claire
my
country
you
mean
outside
tom
no
i
do
think
it
that
way
claire
oh
yes
you
do
tom
your
country
is
the
inside
claire
the
innermost
you
are
disturbed
because
you
lie
too
close
upon
the
heart
of
life
claire
i
do
know
you
can
think
it
one
way
or
another
no
way
says
it
and
that
good
at
least
it
not
shut
up
in
saying
is
looking
at
her
enclosing
hand
as
if
something
is
shut
up
tom
but
also
you
know
things
may
be
freed
by
expression
come
from
the
unrealized
into
the
fabric
of
life
claire
yes
but
why
does
the
fabric
of
life
have
to
freeze
into
its
pattern
it
should
it
with
her
flow
turning
like
an
unsatisfied
child
to
but
i
wanted
to
talk
to
you
tom
you
are
talking
to
me
tell
me
about
your
flower
that
never
was
before
your
breath
of
life
claire
i
know
you
not
go
until
i
know
tom
i
try
to
stay
claire
it
seems
to
me
if
it
has
then
i
have
integrity
in
it
is
as
if
the
smile
lets
her
say
otherness
i
do
want
to
die
on
the
edge
tom
not
you
claire
many
do
it
what
makes
them
too
smug
in
allness
those
dead
things
on
the
edge
died
distorted
trying
to
get
through
oh
think
i
do
see
the
edge
vine
pause
then
do
you
know
what
i
mean
or
do
you
think
i
just
a
fool
or
crazy
tom
i
think
i
know
what
you
mean
and
you
know
i
do
think
you
are
a
fool
or
crazy
claire
stabbed
to
awareness
no
matter
where
it
takes
you
is
that
more
than
a
safe
place
to
stay
him
very
simply
despite
the
pattern
of
pain
in
her
anguish
may
be
a
thread
making
patterns
that
have
been
a
thread
blue
and
burning
tom
take
her
from
what
even
he
fears
for
but
you
were
telling
me
about
the
flower
you
breathed
to
life
what
is
your
breath
of
life
claire
instant
it
a
secret
a
secret
it
a
trick
distilled
from
the
most
fragile
flowers
there
are
it
only
air
pausing
playing
except
far
in
one
stab
of
red
its
quivering
heart
that
asks
a
question
but
here
the
trick
i
bred
the
to
strength
the
strength
shut
up
behind
us
i
sent
far
out
i
know
tomorrow
and
i
have
another
gift
for
breath
of
life
some
day
though
days
of
work
lie
in
between
some
day
i
give
it
reminiscence
fragrance
that
is
no
one
thing
in
here
but
reminiscent
she
raises
wet
we
need
the
haunting
beauty
from
the
life
we
left
i
need
that
takes
her
hands
and
breathes
her
let
me
reach
my
country
with
you
i
not
a
plant
after
all
they
do
accept
me
who
does
accept
me
will
you
tom
my
dear
dear
dear
claire
you
move
me
so
you
stand
alone
in
a
clearness
that
breaks
my
heart
hands
move
up
his
arms
he
takes
them
to
hold
them
from
where
they
would
go
though
he
can
hardly
do
but
you
asked
what
you
yourself
could
answer
best
we
only
stop
in
the
country
where
everyone
stops
claire
we
might
come
through
to
radiance
tom
radiance
is
an
enclosing
place
claire
perhaps
radiance
lighting
forms
undreamed
reckless
i
be
willing
to
take
a
chance
i
rather
lose
than
never
know
tom
no
claire
knowing
you
from
underneath
i
know
you
could
bear
to
lose
claire
would
men
say
you
were
a
fool
tom
they
would
claire
and
perhaps
you
are
smiles
a
i
feel
so
desperate
because
if
only
i
could
show
you
what
i
am
you
might
see
i
could
have
without
losing
but
i
a
stammering
thing
with
you
tom
you
do
show
me
what
you
are
claire
i
known
a
few
moments
that
were
life
why
do
they
help
me
now
one
was
in
the
air
i
was
up
with
harry
flying
high
it
was
about
four
months
before
david
was
born
the
doctor
was
furious
pregnant
women
are
supposed
to
keep
to
earth
we
were
going
fast
i
flying
i
had
left
the
earth
and
then
within
me
movement
for
the
first
time
stirred
to
life
far
in
air
movement
within
the
man
unborn
he
too
would
fly
and
so
i
always
loved
him
he
was
movement
and
wonder
in
his
short
life
were
many
flights
i
never
told
anyone
about
the
last
one
his
little
bed
was
by
the
window
he
was
four
years
old
it
was
night
but
him
not
asleep
he
saw
the
morning
star
you
know
the
morning
star
brighter
stranger
reminiscent
and
a
promise
he
pointed
he
asked
me
is
there
beyond
the
stars
a
baby
a
sick
baby
the
morning
star
next
night
the
finger
that
pointed
was
bites
her
own
but
yes
i
am
glad
he
would
always
have
tried
to
move
and
too
much
would
hold
him
wonder
would
die
and
he
laugh
at
soaring
down
though
i
liked
his
voice
so
i
wish
you
stay
near
me
for
i
like
your
voice
too
tom
claire
that
almost
too
much
claire
of
her
swift
glances
canny
almost
well
glad
if
it
is
how
can
i
make
it
more
what
she
sees
brings
its
own
i
know
what
it
is
you
afraid
of
it
because
i
have
so
much
yes
why
should
i
say
it
passion
you
feel
that
in
me
you
you
think
it
would
swamp
everything
but
that
is
all
there
is
to
me
tom
oh
i
know
it
my
dearest
why
it
because
i
know
it
you
think
i
a
fool
claire
it
a
thing
that
sometimes
more
than
i
am
and
yet
i
i
am
more
than
it
is
tom
i
know
i
know
about
you
claire
i
do
know
that
you
do
perhaps
if
you
really
knew
about
me
you
would
go
away
tom
you
making
me
suffer
claire
claire
i
know
i
am
i
want
to
why
should
you
suffer
seeing
it
more
clearly
than
she
has
ever
seen
you
know
what
i
think
about
you
you
afraid
of
suffering
and
so
you
stop
this
side
in
what
you
persuade
yourself
is
suffering
then
sends
it
you
know
how
it
is
with
me
and
dick
she
sees
him
oh
no
i
do
want
to
hurt
you
let
it
be
you
i
teach
you
you
need
scorn
it
it
rather
wonderful
tom
stop
that
claire
that
is
you
claire
why
are
you
so
afraid
of
letting
me
be
low
if
that
is
low
you
see
i
believe
in
beauty
i
have
the
faith
that
can
be
bad
as
well
as
good
and
you
know
why
i
have
the
faith
because
sometimes
from
my
lowest
moments
beauty
has
opened
as
the
sea
from
a
cave
i
saw
immensity
my
love
you
going
away
let
me
tell
you
how
it
is
with
me
i
want
to
touch
you
somehow

you
once
before
i
die
let
me
tell
you
how
it
is
with
me
i
do
not
want
to
work
i
want
to
be

not
want
to
make
a
rose
or
make
a
poem
want
to
lie
upon
the
earth
and
know
her
stop
doing
that
words
going
into
patterns
they
do
it
sometimes
when
i
let
come
what
there
thoughts
take
pattern
then
the
pattern
is
the
thing
but
let
me
tell
you
how
it
is
with
me
flows
all
that
i
do
or
say
it
is
to
what
it
comes
from
a
drop
lifted
from
the
sea
i
want
to
lie
upon
the
earth
and
know
but
scratch
a
little
dirt
and
make
a
flower
scratch
a
bit
of
brain
something
like
a
poem
her
stop
that
help
me
stop
doing
that
tom
from
the
place
where
she
had
carried
do
talk
at
all
lie
still
and
know
and
know
that
i
am
knowing
claire
yes
but
we
are
so
weak
we
have
to
talk
to
talk
to
touch
why
ca
i
rest
in
knowing
i
would
give
my
life
to
reach
you
that
has
all
there
is
but
i
must
put
my
timid
hands
upon
you
do
something
about
infinity
oh
let
what
will
flow
into
us
and
fill
us
full
and
leave
us
still
wring
me
dry
and
let
me
fill
again
with
life
more
pure
to
know
to
feel
and
do
nothing
with
what
i
feel
and
know
that
being
good
that
nearer
god
in
the
feeling
that
has
flowed
through
her
but
surprised
why
i
said
your
thing
did
i
opened
my
life
to
bring
you
to
me
and
what
came
is
what
sends
you
away
tom
no
what
came
is
what
holds
us
together
what
came
is
what
saves
us
from
ever
going
apart
my
beautiful
one
you
you
brave
flower
of
all
our
knowing
claire
i
am
not
a
flower
i
am
too
torn
if
you
have
anything
help
me
breathe
breathe
the
healing
oneness
and
let
me
know
in
calm
a
sob
his
head
rests
upon
claire
hands
on
his
head
but
looking
beauty
you
pure
one
thing
breathe
let
me
know
in
calm
then
trouble
me
trouble
me
for
other
moments
in
farther
calm
motionless
barely
tom
she
does
not
move
he
lifts
his
head
and
even
as
he
looks
at
her
she
does
not
move
nor
look
at
claire
hand
out
to
her
a
little
you
went
away
from
me
then
you
are
away
from
me
now
claire
yes
and
i
could
go
on
but
i
will
come
back
is
hard
to
do
she
brings
much
with
that
too
i
will
give
you
my
that
the
uttermost
i
can
give
i
never
thought
to
try
to
give
it
but
let
us
do
it
the
great
sacrilege
yes
she
rises
she
has
his
hands
and
bring
him
up
beside
let
us
take
the
mad
chance
perhaps
it
the
only
way
to
save
what
there
how
do
we
know
how
can
we
know
risk
risk
everything
from
all
that
flows
into
us
let
it
rise
all
that
we
never
thought
to
use
to
make
a
moment
let
it
flow
into
what
could
be
bring
all
into
life
between
us
or
send
all
down
to
death
oh
do
you
know
what
i
am
doing
risk
risk
everything
why
are
you
so
afraid
to
lose
what
holds
you
from
me
test
all
let
it
live
or
let
it
die
it
is
our
chance
our
chance
to
bear
what
there
my
dear
one
i
will
love
you
so
with
all
of
me
i
am
not
afraid
now
of
all
of
me
be
generous
be
unafraid
life
is
for
though
it
cuts
us
from
the
farthest
life
how
can
i
make
you
know
that
true
all
that
we
open
to
but
yes
i
will
i
will
risk
the
life
that
waits
perhaps
only
he
who
gives
his
loneliness
shall
find
you
never
keep
by
holding
of
to
the
uttermost
and
it
is
gone
or
it
is
there
you
do
not
know
and
that
makes
the
moment
has
begun
a
phonograph
downstairs
they
do
not
heed
just
as
i
would
cut
my
wrists
them
yes
perhaps
this
lesser
thing
will
tell
it
would
cut
my
wrists
and
let
the
blood
flow
out
till
all
is
gone
if
my
last
drop
would
make
would
make
at
them
i
want
to
see
it
doing
that
let
me
give
my
last
chance
for
life
to
snatches
her
they
are
on
the
brink
of
their
moment
now
that
there
are
no
words
the
phonograph
from
downstairs
is
louder
it
is
playing
languorously
the
barcarole
they
become
conscious
of
this
they
do
not
want
to
be
touched
by
the
love
claire
do
listen
that
nothing
this
is
that
i
tell
you
it
is
that
yes
i
know
that
amorous
enclosing
i
know
a
little
place
this
is
that
arms
going
around
him
all
the
lure
of
while
she
pleads
against
it
as
it
comes
up
to
we
will
come
out
to
radiance
in
far
places
oh
then
let
it
be
that
go
with
it
give
up
the
otherness
i
will
and
in
the
giving
up
perhaps
a
door
we
never
find
by
searching
and
if
no
more
than
all
have
known
i
only
say
it
worth
the
allness
arms
wrapped
round
my
love
my
love
let
go
your
pride
in
loneliness
and
let
me
give
you
joy
tom
in
her
passion
but
it
you
rare
thing
untouched
not
not
into
this
not
back
into
this
by
me
lover
of
your
apartness
steps
back
she
sees
he
can
not
she
stands
there
before
what
she
wanted
more
than
life
and
almost
had
and
lost
a
long
moment
then
she
runs
down
the
claire
voice
coming

they
will
harry

to
dick
dick
a
moment
or
two
adelaide
adelaide
her
head
well
these
stairs
should
keep
down
weight
you
missed
an
awfully
good
dinner
claire
and
kept
mr
edgeworth
from
a
good
dinner
claire
yes
we
missed
our
dinner
eyes
do
not
leave
the
place
dr
emmons
come
harry
he
emmons
claire
this
is
claire
yes
i
know
who
he
is
i
want
to
ask
you
adelaide
let
the
poor
man
get
his
breath
before
you
ask
him
anything
nods
smiles
looks
claire
interest
careful
not
to
look
too
long
at
her
surveys
the
emmons
curious
place
adelaide
yes
it
lacks
form
does
it
claire
what
do
you
mean
how
you
is
impossible
to
ignore
her
agitation
she
is
backed
against
the
curved
wall
as
far
as
possible
from
harry
at
her
in
alarm
then
in
resentment
tom
takes
a
step
claire
harry
to
be
do
take
it
so
hard
claire
claire
emmons
it
must
be
very
interesting
helping
people
go
insane
adelaide
claire
how
preposterous
emmons
i
hope
that
not
precisely
what
we
do
adelaide
the
smile
of
one
who
is
going
to
trust
claire
to
put
it
in
the
unique
and
amusing
way
claire
amusing
you
are
amused
but
it
does
matter
the
i
think
it
is
very
kind
of
you
helping
people
go
insane
i
suppose
they
have
all
sorts
of
reasons
for
having
to
do
it
reasons
why
they
ca
stay
sane
any
longer
but
tell
me
how
do
they
do
it
not
so
easy
to
get
out
how
do
so
many
manage
it
emmons
i
like
immensely
to
have
a
talk
with
you
about
all
this
some
day
adelaide
certainly
this
is
not
the
time
claire
claire
the
time
when
you
ca
go
any
farther
is
that
that
adelaide
taking
the
whole
thing
into
what
i
think
is
claire
has
worked
too
long
with
plants
something
not
quite
sound
about
making
one
thing
into
another
thing
what
we
need
is
unity
claire
like
a
yes
dear
we
do
need
it
the
i
ca
say
that
i
believe
in
making
life
over
like
this
i
do
think
the
new
species
are
worth
it
at
least
i
do
believe
in
it
for
claire
if
one
is
an
intense
sensitive
person
claire
is
there
any
way
to
her
always
always
smothering
it
with
the
word
for
it
emmons
but
she
ca
smother
it
anything
that
really
there
she
ca
hurt
with
words
claire
at
him
with
eyes
too
then
you
do
see
it
either
yes
she
can
hurt
it
piling
it
up
always
piling
it
up
between
us
and
what
there
clogging
the
way
always
emmons
i
want
to
cease
to
know
that
all
i
ask
darken
it
darken
it
if
you
came
to
help
me
strike
me
blind
emmons
you
really
all
tired
out
are
you
oh
we
got
to
get
you
rested
claire
they
deny
it
saying
they
have
it
and
he
looks
quickly
looks
others
deny
it
afraid
of
losing
it
in
the
way
ca
you
see
the
dead
stuff
piled
in
the
path
dick
coming
me
too
claire
at
the
path
hearing
his
voice
a
moment
after

too
he
has
come
what
is
there

more
than

the
intensity

a
question

at
all
displeasing
to
me

can
answer
it
to
him
in

claire
all

curious
weary
smiling

a
very
important
day
for
me

mr
archer
hattie
well
suppose

does
something
to
mr
demming
anthony
mr
demming
will
have
to
look
out
for
himself
i
am
at
work
hattie
do
you
think
i
ought
to
tell
mrs
archer
that
anthony
you
let
her
alone
this
is
no
day
for
her
to
be
bothered
by
you
at
eleven
at
she
comes
out
here
to
breath
of
life
hattie
greed
for
did
you
see
any
of
them
when
they
came
downstairs
last
night
anthony
i
was
attending
to
my
own
affairs
hattie
they
was
all
excited
mr
edgeworth
he
went
away
he
was
gone
all
night
i
guess
i
saw
him
coming
back
just
as
the
milkman
woke
me
up
now
he
packing
his
things
wanted
to
get
to
mrs
archer
too
just
a
little
while
ago
but
she
wo
open
her
door
for
none
of
them
i
ca
even
get
in
to
do
her
room
anthony
then
do
some
other
room
and
leave
me
alone
in
this
room
hattie
little
afraid
of
what
she
is
is
she
sick
anthony
or
what
herself
as
he
gives
her
a
the
doctor
he
stayed
here
late
but
she
locked
herself
in
i
heard
mr
archer
anthony
you
heard
too
much
starts
for
the
door
to
make
her
leave
dick
in
looks
around
wildly
goes
to
the
finds
it
anthony
what
are
you
doing
here
dick
trying
not
to
be
shot
if
you
must
know
this
is
the
only
place
i
can
think
of
till
he
comes
to
his
senses
and
i
can
get
away
open
that
will
you
rather
ignominious
but
better
be
absurd
than
be
dead
hattie
has
he
got
the
revolver
dick
gone
for
it
thought
i
would
sit
there
till
he
got
back
anthony
look
here
do
you
get
the
idea
get
me
some
place
where
he
ca
come
anthony
it
is
not
what
this
place
is
for
dick
any
place
is
for
saving
a
man
life
hattie
sure
anthony
mrs
archer
would
want
mr
demming
shot
dick
that
right
anthony
miss
claire
will
be
angry
at
you
if
you
get
me
shot
makes
for
the
door
of
the
inner
anthony

ca
go
in
there

locked
harry
in
from

now
mr
archer
if
you
just
stop
and
think
you
know
miss
claire
would
want
mr
demming

me
you
think
you
can
stop
me
the
a
dog
that
anthony
squarely
harry
dick
well
you
shoot
him
in
here
it
is
not
good
for
the
plants
harry
arrested
by
this
and
especially
not
today
why
mr
archer
breath
of
life
may
flower
today

working
for
this
day
harry

will
be
a
wonderful
day
and
how
she
has
worked
for
it
she
has
an
eye
that
sees
what
is
right
in
what
looks
right
many
the
time
i
thought
here
the
form
is
set
and
then
she
say
try
this
one
and
it
had
what
i
had
known
was
there
she
like
that
harry
i
always
been
pleased
anthony
at
the
way
you
worked
with
miss
claire
this
is
hardly
the
time
to
stand
there
eulogizing
her
and
she
hardly
say
things
you
do
know
she
is
anthony
oh
i
know
that
you
think
i
could
work
with
her
and
not
know
she
more
than
i
know
she
is
harry
well
if
you
love
her
you
got
to
let
me
shoot
the
dirty
dog
that
drags
her
down
anthony
not
in
here
not
today
more
than
like
you
break
the
glass
and
breath
of
life
in
there
harry
anthony
this
is
pretty
clever
of
you
but
anthony
i
not
clever
but
i
know
how
easy
it
is
to
turn
life
back
no
i
not
clever
at
all
claire
appeared
and
is
looking
in
from
but
i
do
know
there
are
things
you
must
hurt
sees
yes
here
miss
claire
comes
in
she
is
looking
claire
from
the
gutter
i
rise
again
refreshed
one
does
you
know
nothing
is
fixed
not
even
the
gutter
harry
refusing
to
notice
revolver
or
how
did
you
like
the
way
i
entertained
the
nerve
specialist
harry
claire
you
can
about
it
claire
the
revolver
from
the
hand
she
has
shocked
to
whom
are
you
trying
to
make
hear
harry
i
trying
to
make
the
world
hear
that
there
stands
a
dirty
dog
who
claire
listen
harry
hattie
is
over
by
the
tall
plants
at
right
not
wanting
to
be
shot
but
not
wanting
to
miss
the
you
can
do
my
room
now
hattie
if
thinking
of
shooting
dick
you
ca
shoot
him
while
he
backed
up
against
that
door
anthony
just
what
i
told
them
miss
claire
just
what
i
told
them
claire
and
for
that
matter
it
quite
dull
of
you
to
have
any
idea
of
shooting
him
harry
i
may
be
dull
i
know
you
think
i
am
but
i
show
you
that
enough
of
the
man
in
me
to
claire
to
make
yourself
ridiculous
if
i
ran
out
and
hid
my
head
in
the
mud
would
you
think
you
had
to
shoot
the
mud
dick
out
of
that
pretty
cruel
claire
well
would
you
rather
be
shot
harry
so
you
just
said
it
to
protect
him
claire
i
change
it
to
grass
dick
grass
if
i
hid
my
face
in
the
grass
would
you
have
to
burn
the
grass
harry
oh
claire
how
you
when
you
know
how
i
love
you
and
how
i
suffering
claire
are
you
suffering
harry
have
you
claire
i
should
think
it
would
do
something
to
you
harry
god
have
you
no
heart
door
tom
claire
saying
yes
i
have
a
heart
tom
a
i
came
to
say
claire
god
have
you
no
heart
ca
you
at
least
wait
till
dick
is
shot
tom
claire
sees
the
revolver
in
her
hand
that
is
turned
from
him
going
to
claire
claire
and
even
you
think
this
is
so
important
raises
the
revolver
and
with
her
left
hand
out
flat
tom
to
touch
harry
thinks
it
important
he
shoot
dick
and
dick
thinks
it
important
not
to
be
shot
and
you
think
i
must
shoot
anybody
even
myself
and
ca
any
of
you
see
that
none
of
that
is
as
important
as
where
revolvers
ca
reach
revolver
where
there
is
no
edge
i
shall
never
shoot
myself
i
too
interested
in
destruction
to
cut
it
short
by
shooting
looking
from
one
to
the
other
laughs
one
two
three
but
why
do
you
bring
it
out
here
anthony
has
resumed
it
is
not
what
this
place
is
for
claire
no
this
place
is
for
the
destruction
that
can
get
through
anthony
miss
claire
it
is
eleven
at
eleven
we
are
to
go
in
and
see
claire
whether

against
the
door
anthony
he
have
to
move
claire
and

claire
yes
but
afraid

the
same
feeling
myself
about
making
a
record
in
flying
claire
you
have
harry
harry
enough
to
be
back
in
a
more
usual
sure
i

afraid
to
know
and
almost
as
afraid
of
having
done
it
as
of
not
having
done
it
claire
steps
nearer
then
again
pulls
claire
i
ca
go
in
there

in
out
from
its
own
place
and
where
they
are
she
nods
reluctantly
he
goes
to
the
i
will
not
look
into
the
heart
no
one
must
know
before
you
know
the
inner
room
his
head
a
little
turned
away
he
is
seen
very
carefully
to
lift
the
plant
which
glows
from
within
as
he
brings
it
in
no
one
looks
at
harry
a
box
of
seedlings
from
a
stand
and
puts
them
on
the
floor
that
the
newcomer
may
have
a
anthony
breath
of
life
is
here
miss
claire
claire
turns
then
claire
look
and
see
what
you
see
anthony
no
one
should
see
what
you
not
seen
claire
i
ca
see
until
i
know
anthony
into
the
anthony
miss
claire
claire
it
has
come
through
anthony
it
has
gone
on
claire
stronger
anthony
stronger
surer
claire
and
more
fragile
anthony
and
more
fragile
claire
look
deep
no
turning
back
anthony
a
searching
the
form
is
set
steps
back
from
claire
then
it
is
out
where
she
stands
she
turns
slowly
to
the
you
were
you
are
anthony
but
come
and
see
miss
claire
claire
it
so
much
more
than
i
see
harry
well
i
going
to
see
into
i
never
saw
anything
like
that
before
there
seems
something
alive
inside
this
outer
shell
dick
too
looking
in
and
he
has
an
artist
manner
of
a
hand
up
to
make
the
light
it
quite
new
in
form
it
says
something
about
form
harry
claire
stands
so

really
put
it
over
well
well
congratulations

a
good
deal
of
novelty

no
doubt

a
considerable
success
with
it
people
always
like
something
new

mighty
glad
after
all
your
work
and
i
hope
it
will
set
you
up
claire
and
like
a
will
you
all
go
away
anthony
into
the
other
harry
why
why
yes
but
oh
claire
ca
you
take
some
pleasure
in
your
work
she
stands
there
very
emmons

a
good
long
rest
and
i
think
he
right
tom
ca
this
help
you
claire
let
this
be
release
this
breath
of
the
uncaptured
claire
though
speaking
she
remains
just
as
breath
of
the
uncaptured
you
are
a
novelty
out
you
have
been
brought
in
a
thousand
years
from
now
when
you
are
but
a
form
too
long
repeated
perhaps
the
madness
that
gave
you
birth
will
burst
again
and
from
the
prison
that
is
you
will
leap
pent
queernesses
to
make
a
form
that
has
been
to
make
a
person
new
and
this
we
call
creation

is
claire
slight
shrinking
away
but
not
really
um
um
claire
nearer
her
creation
she
looks
into
what
has
been
with
her
breath
and
by
a
gentle
moving
of
her
hands
she
fans
it
to
fuller
openness
as
she
does
tom

from
outside

looking
in
at

opens
the
door
and
comes
in

is
there
in
the
way

looks
at

into
the
womb

if

little
about

your
life
says
it
by
standing

off
you
pass
for
it
smother
it
with
a
life
that
passes
for
it
but
beauty
it
from
the
beauty
is
the
humility
breathed
from
the
shame
of
succeeding
tom
but
it
may
all
be
within
one
self
dear
claire
by
this

smith
just
come
in
and
hat
in
hand
is
standing
by
the
table
this
was
lived
in
the
year
afternoon
of
fourth
of
smith
but
the
celebration
was
over
two
hours
ago
grandmother
oh
celebration
that
just
the
beginning
of
it
might
as
well
set
down
when
them
boys
that
fought
together
all
get
in
one
square
they
have
to
swap
stories
all
over
again
that
the
worst
of
a
war
you
have
to
go
on
hearing
about
it
so
long
here
it
is
and
we
have
taken
gettysburg
yet
well
it
was
the
same
way
with
the
war
of
smith
is
now
seated
at
the
the
war
of
grandmother
news
to
you
that
we
had
a
war
with
the
indians
smith
that
right
the
blackhawk
war
i
heard
of
it
grandmother
heard
of
it
smith
were
your
men
in
that
war
grandmother
i
was
in
that
war
i
threw
an
indian
in
the
cellar
and
stood
on
the
door
i
was
heavier
then
smith
those
were
stirring
times
grandmother
more
stirring
than
you
ever
see
this
war
war
it
all
a
cut
and
dried
business
now
we
used
to
fight
with
anything
we
could
lay
hands
on
dish
water
whatever
was
handy
smith
i
guess
you
believe
the
saying
that
the
only
good
indian
is
a
dead
indian
grandmother
i
dunno
we
roiled
them
up
considerable
they
was
mostly
friendly
when
let
be
did
want
to
give
up
their
land
but
noticed
something
of
the
same
nature
in
white
folks
smith
your
son
has
something
of
that
nature
has
he
grandmother
he
not
keen
to
sell
why
should
he
it
never
be
worth
less
smith
but
since
he
has
more
land
than
any
man
can
use
and
if
he
gets
his
price
grandmother
that
what
you
come
to
talk
to
him
about
smith
i
yes
grandmother
well
you
not
the
first
many
a
man
older
than
you
has
come
to
argue
it
smith
they
thought
they
try
a
young
one
grandmother
some
one
that
knew
him
thought
that
up
silas
help
a
young
one
if
he
could
what
is
it
you
set
on
buying
smith
oh
i
do
know
that
we
set
on
buying
anything
if
we
could
have
the
hill
off
to
the
at
a
fair
price
grandmother
the
hill
above
the
town
silas
rather
sell
me
and
the
cat
smith
but
what
he
going
to
do
with
it
grandmother
maybe
he
going
to
climb
it
once
a
week
smith
but
if
the
development
of
the
town
demands
its
use
grandmother
you
the
development
of
the
town
smith
i
represent
it
this
town
has
been
growing
so
fast
grandmother
this
town
began
to
grow
the
day
i
got
here
smith
you
you
began
it
grandmother
my
husband
and
i
began
it
and
our
baby
silas
smith
when

that
grandmother
that
was
smith
and
you
mean
you
were
here
all
alone
grandmother
no
we
were
alone
we
had
the
owens
ten
miles
down
the
river
smith
but
how
did
you
get
here
grandmother
got
here
in
a
wagon
how
do
you
think
we
flew
smith
but
was
it
unsafe
grandmother
them
set
on
safety
stayed
back
in
ohio
smith
but
one
family
i
should
think
the
indians
would
have
wiped
you
out
grandmother
the
way
they
wiped
us
out
was
to
bring
fish
and
corn
have
starved
to
death
that
first
winter
had
been
for
the
indians
smith
but
they
were
such
good
neighbours
why
did
you
throw
dish
water
at
them
grandmother
that
was
after
other
white
folks
had
roiled
them
up
white
folks
that
did
know
how
to
treat
this
very
land
land
you
want
to
buy
was
the
land
they
loved
blackhawk
and
his
indians
they
came
here
for
their
games
this
was
where
their
fathers
as
they
called
were
buried
i
seen
my
husband
and
blackhawk
climb
that
hill
together
backward
point
he
used
to
love
that
hill
blackhawk
he
talked
how
the
red
man
and
the
white
man
could
live
together
but
poor
old
blackhawk
what
he
did
know
was
how
many
white
man
there
was
after
the
war
when
he
was
beaten
but
not
conquered
in
his
heart
they
took
him
east
washington
philadelphia
new
york
and
when
he
saw
the
white
man
cities
it
was
a
different
indian
came
back
he
just
let
his
heart
break
without
ever
turning
a
hand
smith
but
we
paid
them
for
their
lands
looks
at
paid
them
something
grandmother
something
for
fifteen
million
acres
of
this
mississippi
valley
land
best
on
this
globe
we
paid
two
thousand
two
hundred
and
dollars
and
fifty
cents
and
promised
to
deliver
annually
goods
to
the
value
of
one
thousand
dollars
not
a
fancy
price
even
for
them
days
voices
are
heard
outside
she
leans
forward
and
looks
through
the
door
ira
let
that
cat
be
smith
from
the
these
i
suppose
are
your
grandchildren
grandmother
the
boy
my
grandson
the
little
girl
is
madeline
fejevary
mr
fejevary
youngest
child
smith
the
fejevary
place
adjoins
on
this
side
right
grandmother
yes
we
been
neighbours
ever
since
the
fejevarys
came
here
from
hungary
after
he
was
a
count
at
home
and
he
a
man
of
learning
but
he
was
a
refugee
because
he
fought
for
freedom
in
his
country
nothing
silas
could
do
for
him
was
too
good
silas
sets
great
store
by
learning
and
freedom
smith
of
his
own
project
looking
off
toward
the
hill
the
hill
is
not
seen
from
the
i
suppose
then
mr
fejevary
has
great
influence
with
your
son
grandmother
more
anybody
silas
thinks
was
a
great
thing
for
our
family
to
have
a
family
like
theirs
next
place
to
well
so
was
for
we
had
no
time
for
the
things
their
family
was
brought
up
on
old
mrs
fejevary
her
shrewd
she
were
stuck
up
but
she
did
have
an
awful
ladylike
way
of
feeding
the
chickens
silas
thinks
oh
my
son
has
all
kinds
of
notions
though
a
harder
worker
never
found
his
bed
at
night
smith
and
mr
fejevary
is
he
a
veteran
too
grandmother
you
do
seem
to
know
these
parts
well
for
one
that
all
stirred
up
about
the
development
of
the
town
yes
felix
fejevary
and
silas
morton
went
off
together
down
that
road
with
her
hand
when
them
of
their
age
was
wanted
fejevary
came
back
with
one
arm
less
than
he
went
with
silas
brought
home
everything
he
took
and
something
he
did
rheumatiz
so
now
they
set
more
store
by
each
other
ever
seems
nothing
draws
men
together
like
killing
other
men
boy
voice
teasingly
imitating
a
madeline
make
ira
let
that
cat
be
whoop
from
the
girl
a
boy
there
they
go
off
for
the
creek
if
they
set
in
it
about
to
call
after
them
gives
this
well
they
not
the
first
dreams
over
smith
you
must
feel
as
if
you
pretty
near
owned
this
country
grandmother
we
worked
a
country
do
make
itself
when
the
sun
was
up
we
were
up
and
when
the
sun
went
down
we
did
if
this
renews
the
self
of
those
here
let
me
set
out
something
for
you
to
eat
up
with
smith
oh
no
please
never
mind
i
had
something
in
town
before
i
came
out
grandmother
dunno
as
that
any
reason
you
should
have
something
here
goes
off
right
he
stands
at
the
door
looking
toward
the
hill
until
she
returns
with
a
glass
of
milk
a
plate
of
smith
well
this
looks
good
grandmother
i
fed
a
lot
of
folks
take
it
by
and
large
i
care
how
many
i
had
to
feed
in
the
daytime
what
ten
or
fifteen
more
when
you
up
and
around
but
to
get
up
after
sixteen
hours
on
your
feet
was
willin
but
my
bones
complained
some
smith
but
did
you
keep
a
tavern
grandmother
keep
a
tavern
i
guess
we
did
every
house
is
a
tavern
when
houses
are
sparse
you
think
the
way
to
settle
a
country
is
to
go
on
ahead
and
build
hotels
that
all
you
folks
know
why
i
never
went
to
bed
without
leaving
something
on
the
stove
for
the
new
ones
that
might
be
coming
and
we
never
went
away
from
home
without
seein
there
was
for
them
that
might
stop
smith
they
come
right
in
and
take
your
food
grandmother
what
else
could
they
do
there
was
a
woman
i
always
wanted
to
know
she
made
a
kind
of
bread
i
never
had
before
and
left
for
our
supper
when
we
got
back
with
the
ducks
and
berries
and
she
left
the
kitchen
handier
than
it
had
ever
been
i
often
wondered
about
her
where
she
came
from
and
where
she
went
she
dreams
over
this
there
is
laughing
and
talking
at
the

muskets
they
used
in
the

lean
distinguished
face
his
dark
eyes
are
penetrating
and
rather
wistful
the
left
sleeve
of
his
old
uniform
is
silas
morton
a
strong
man
who
has
borne
the
burden
of

bad
time
for

to
present
a
little
matter
to
you
silas
that
depends
of
course
on
what

little
matter
to
your
horse
like
to
uncheck

you
old

smith
your

is
fond
of
animals
grandmother
lots
of

good
to

i
dunno
it
as
if

that
animal
fejevary
he
has
imagination
grandmother
think
so
silas
and
sitting
down
at
the
table
by
the
young
now
what
in
your
mind
my
boy
smith
this
town
is
growing
very
fast
mr
morton
silas
yes
with
i
know
that
smith
i
presume
you
as
one
of
the
early
settlers
as
in
fact
a
son
of
the
earliest
settler
feel
a
certain
responsibility
about
the
welfare
of
silas
i
have
got
in
mind
to
do
the
town
a
bit
of
harm
so
your
point
smith
more
people
more
homes
and
homes
must
be
in
the
healthiest
places
the
the
most
beautiful
places
is
it
true
mr
fejevary
that
it
means
a
great
deal
to
people
to
have
a
beautiful
outlook
from
their
homes
a
well
an
expanse
silas
what
is
it
they
want
to
buy
these
fellows
that
are
figuring
on
making
something
out
of
expanse
gesture
for
expanse
then
a
reassuring
it
all
right
but
just
what
is
it
smith
i
am
prepared
to
make
you
an
offer
a
offer
for
that
toward
hill
above
the
town
silas
his
head
with
the
smile
of
the
strong
man
who
is
a
the
hill
is
not
for
sale
smith
but
would
you
consider
a
particularly
good
offer
mr
morton
silas
has
turned
so
he
can
look
out
at
the
hill
slowly
shakes
his
smith
do
you
feel
you
have
the
right
the
moral
right
to
hold
it
silas
it
not
for
myself
i
holding
it
smith
oh
for
the
children
silas
yes
the
children
smith
but
if
you
excuse
me
there
are
other
investments
might
do
the
children
even
more
good
silas
this
seems
to
me
the
best
investment
smith
but
after
all
there
are
other
people
children
to
consider
silas
yes
i
know
that
it
smith
i
wonder
if
i
understand
you
mr
morton
silas
i
do
believe
you
do
i
do
see
how
you
could
and
i
ca
explain
myself
just
now
so
the
hill
is
not
for
sale
i
not
making
anybody
homeless
there
land
enough
for
all
all
sides
round
but
the
hill
smith
is
yours
silas
you
see
smith
i
am
prepared
to
offer
you
silas
you
not
prepared
to
offer
me
anything
i
consider
alongside
what
i
am
considering
so
i
wish
you
good
luck
in
your
business
undertakings
smith
sorry
you
wo
let
us
try
to
help
the
town
silas

up
nights
worrying
about
my
chokin
the
town

could
make
you
a
rich
man

much
richer

hill
while
they
anxious
fejevary
he
seems
to
have
another
plan
for
it
grandmother
yes

something
silas
has
worked
all
the
days
of
his
life
fejevary
i
know
grandmother

think
about
it

grandmother
get
myself
pity
if

how
hard

for
i
wish

strength
is
a
flame
frailness

put
out
it
a
great
thing
for
us
to
have
her
this
touch
with
the
life
behind
us
silas
yes
and
it
a
great
thing
for
us
to
have
you
who
can
see
those
things
and
say
them
what
a
lot
i
missed
if
i
had
had
what
you
seen
fejevary
oh
you
only
think
that
because
you
got
to
be
generous
silas
i
not
generous
seeing
something
now
something
about
you
i
been
thinking
of
it
a
good
deal
lately
it
got
something
to
do
with
with
the
hill
i
been
thinkin
what
it
meant
all
these
years
to
have
a
family
like
yours
next
place
to
they
did
something
pretty
nice
for
the
corn
belt
when
they
drove
you
out
of
hungary
funny
how
things
do
end
the
way
they
begin
i
mean
what
begins
do
end
it
another
thing
ends
set
out
to
do
something
for
your
own
country
and
maybe
you
do
quite
do
the
thing
you
set
out
to
do
fejevary
no
silas
but
do
something
for
a
country
a
long
way
off
fejevary
i
afraid
i
not
done
much
for
any
country
silas
where
your
left
arm
may
i
be
so
bold
as
to
inquire
though
your
left
arm
nothing
alongside
what
ca
be
measured
fejevary
when
i
think
of
what
i
dreamed
as
a
young
man
it
seems
to
me
my
life
has
failed
silas
his
well
if
your
life
failed
i
like
failure
grandmother
morton
with
her
grandmother
there
two
kinds
mr
fejevary
these
have
seeds
in
fejevary
thank
you
i
try
a
seed
cookie
first
silas
mother
you
have
a
glass
of
wine
grandmother
i
do
need
wine
silas
well
i
do
know
as
we
need
it
grandmother
no
i
do
know
as
you
do
but
i
did
go
to
war
fejevary
then
have
a
little
wine
to
celebrate
that
grandmother
well
just
a
mite
to
warm
me
up
not
that
it
cold
fejevary
it
to
her
and
the
the
indians
used
to
like
cookies
i
was
talking
to
that
young
whippersnapper
about
the
indians
one
time
i
saw
an
indian
watching
me
from
a
bush
right
out
there
i
was
never
afraid
of
indians
when
you
could
see
the
whole
of
but
when
you
could
see
nothin
but
their
bright
eyes
through
leaves
i
declare
they
made
me
nervous
after
he
been
there
an
hour
i
could
seem
to
put
my
mind
on
my
work
so
i
thought
red
or
white
a
man
a
man
i
take
him
some
cookies
fejevary
it
succeeded
grandmother
so
well
that
those
leaves
had
eyes
next
day
but
he
brought
me
a
fish
to
trade
he
was
a
nice
boy
silas
probably
we
killed
him
grandmother
i
dunno
maybe
he
killed
us
will
owens
family
was
massacred
just
after
this
like
as
not
my
cookie
indian
helped
out
there
something
kind
of
uncertain
about
the
indians
silas
i
guess
they
found
something
kind
of
uncertain
about
us
grandmother
six
o
one
and
half
a
dozen
of
another
usually
is
silas
fejevary
i
wonder
if
i
wrong
you
see
i
never
went
to
school
grandmother
i
do
know
why
you
say
that
silas
there
was
two
winters
you
went
to
school
silas
yes
mother
and
i
glad
i
did
for
i
learned
to
read
there
and
liked
the
geography
globe
it
made
the
earth
so
nice
to
think
about
and
one
day
the
teacher
told
us
all
about
the
stars
and
i
had
that
to
think
of
when
i
was
driving
at
night
the
other
boys
did
believe
it
was
so
but
i
knew
it
was
so
but
i
mean
school
the
way
mr
fejevary
went
to
school
he
went
to
universities
in
his
own
countries
in
other
countries
all
the
things
men
have
found
out
the
wisest
and
finest
things
men
have
thought
since
first
they
began
to
think
all
that
was
put
before
them
fejevary
a
gentle
i
fear
i
left
a
good
deal
of
it
untouched
silas
you
took
a
plenty
tell
in
your
eyes
you
thought
lots
about
what
been
thought
and
that
what
i
was
setting
out
to
say
it
makes
something
of
men
learning
a
house
that
full
of
books
makes
a
different
kind
of
people
oh
of
course
if
the
books
are
there
just
to
show
off
grandmother
like
in
mary
baldwin
new
house
silas
hard
to
see
it
not
the
learning
itself
it
the
life
that
grows
up
from
learning
learning
like
soil
like
like
fertilizer
get
richer
see
more
feel
more
you
believe
that
fejevary
culture
should
do
it
silas
does
in
your
house
you
somehow
know
how
it
is
for
the
other
fellow
we
do
grandmother
well
silas
morton
when
you
your
wood
to
chop
an
your
water
to
carry
when
you
kill
your
own
cattle
and
hogs
tend
your
own
horses
and
hens
make
your
butter
soap
and
cook
for
whoever
the
lord
sends
there
none
too
many
hours
of
the
day
left
to
be
polite
in
silas
you
right
mother
it
had
to
be
that
way
but
now
that
we
buy
our
soap
we
do
want
to
say
what
made
us
grandmother
we
honest
silas
yes
in
a
way
but
there
another
kind
o
honesty
seems
to
me
goes
with
that
more
seein
kind
of
kindness
our
honesty
with
the
indians
was
little
to
brag
on
grandmother
you
fret
more
about
the
indians
than
anybody
else
does
silas
to
look
out
at
that
hill
sometimes
makes
me
ashamed
grandmother
land
sakes
you
did
do
it
it
was
the
government
and
what
a
government
does
is
nothing
for
a
person
to
be
ashamed
of
silas
i
do
know
about
that
why
is
here
why
is
felix
fejevary
not
rich
and
grand
in
hungary
he
was
ashamed
of
what
his
government
was
grandmother
well
that
was
a
foreign
government
silas
a
seeing
how
is
for
the
other
person
that
other
person
kind
of
honesty
joke
of
it
do
something
for
done
something
for
us
to
have
indians
a
little
more
my
father
used
to
talk
about
blackhawk
they
was
friends
i
saw
blackhawk
once
when
i
was
a
boy
fejevary
guess
i
told
you
you
know
what
he
looked
like
he
looked
like
the
great
of
the
earth
noble
noble
like
the
forests
and
the
mississippi
and
the
stars
his
face
was
long
and
thin
and
you
could
see
the
bones
and
the
bones
were
beautiful
looked
like
something
that
never
been
caught
he
was
something
many
nights
in
his
canoe
had
made
him
sometimes
i
feel
that
the
land
itself
has
got
a
mind
that
the
land
would
rather
have
had
the
indians
grandmother
well
do
let
folks
hear
you
say
it
they
think
you
was
plum
crazy
silas
i
they
would
fejevary
but
after
walked
a
long
time
over
the
earth
and
you
all
alone
did
you
ever
feel
something
coming
up
from
it
that
like
thought
fejevary
i
afraid
i
never
did
but
i
wish
i
had
silas
i
love
land
this
land
i
suppose
that
why
i
never
have
the
feeling
that
i
own
it
grandmother
if
you
do
own
it
i
want
to
know
what
do
you
think
we
come
here
for
your
father
and
me
what
do
you
think
we
left
our
folks

set
out
in
a
covered
wagon

did
know
what
we
lost
a
horse
lost
our
way
weeks
longer
than
we
thought
be
you
were
born
in
that
covered
wagon
you
know
that
but
what
you
do
know
is
what
like
without
your
own
roof
or
fire
without

about
it
the
best
scientists
accept
it
teachers
are
losing
their
positions
for
believing
it
of
course
ministers
ca
believe
it
grandmother
i
should
think
not
anyway
what
the
use
believing
a
thing
that
so
discouraging
fejevary
but
is
it
that
it
almost
seems
to
me
we
have
to
accept
it
because
it
is
so
encouraging
out
his
why
have
we
hands
grandmother
cause
god
gave
them
to
us
i
fejevary
but
that
rather
general
and
there
is
much
in
it
to
give
us
but
when
you
think
we
have
hands
because
ages
back
before
life
had
taken
form
as
man
there
was
an
impulse
to
do
what
had
never
been
done
when
you
think
that
we
have
hands
today
because
from
the
first
of
life
there
have
been
adventurers
those
of
best
brain
and
courage
who
wanted
to
be
more
than
life
had
been
and
that
from
aspiration
has
come
doing
and
doing
has
shaped
the
thing
with
which
to
do
it
gives
our
hand
a
history
which
should
make
us
want
to
use
it
well
silas
from
well
by
god
and
you
known
this
all
this
while
you
why
did
you
tell
me
fejevary
i
been
thinking
about
it
i
have
known
what
to
believe
this
hurts
beliefs
of
earlier
years
felix
the
things
it
hurts
will
have
to
go
fejevary
i
do
know
about
that
felix
perhaps
in
time
we
find
truth
in
them
felix
oh
if
you
feel
that
way
father
fejevary
do
be
kind
to
me
my
boy
i
not
that
old
silas
but
think
what
it
is
you
said
if
it
true
that
we
made
ourselves
made
ourselves
out
of
the
wanting
to
be
more
created
ourselves
you
might
say
by
our
own
courage
our
what
is
it
aspiration
why
i
ca
take
it
in
i
have
got
the
mind
to
take
it
in
and
what
mind
i
have
got
says
no
it
too
fejevary
it
fights
with
what
there
silas
but
it
like
i
got
this
other
way
around
from
underneath
as
if
i
known
it
all
along
but
have
just
found
out
i
know
it
yes
the
earth
told
me
the
beasts
told
me
grandmother
fine
place
to
learn
things
from
silas
anyhow
have
i
seen
it
fejevary
in
your
face
have
i
seen
thinking
make
a
finer
face
how
long
has
this
taken
felix
to
well
you
might
say
bring
us
where
we
are
now
felix
oh
we
do
know
how
many
millions
of
years
since
earth
first
stirred
silas
then
we
are
what
we
are
because
through
all
that
time
been
them
that
wanted
to
be
more
than
life
had
been
felix
that
it
uncle
silas
silas
but
why
then
we
are
yet
fejevary
no
we
take
it
on
from
here
silas
then
if
we
do
be
the
most
we
can
be
if
we
be
more
than
life
has
been
we
go
back
on
all
that
life
behind
us
go
back
on
the
to
formulate
it
he
looks
fejevary
fejevary
go
back
on
the
dreaming
and
the
daring
of
a
million
years
a
moment
silas
up
opens
the
closet
grandmother
silas
what
you
doing
silas
has
taken
out
a
i
lookin
for
the
deed
to
the
hill
grandmother
what
you
going
to
do
with
it
silas
i
going
to
get
it
out
of
my
hands
grandmother
get
it
out
of
your
hands
has
it
deed
your
father
got
from
the
government
the
very
year
the
government
got
it
from
the
indians
give
me
that
turns
fejevary
tell
him
he
crazy
we
got
the
best
land
we
was
first
here
we
got
a
right
to
keep
it
fejevary
soothingly
to
it
true
silas
it
is
a
serious
thing
to
give
away
one
land
silas
you
ought
to
know
you
did
it
are
you
sorry
you
did
it
fejevary
no
but
was
that
different
silas
how
was
it
different
yours
was
a
fight
to
make
life
more
it
well
let
this
be
our
way
grandmother
what
all
that
got
to
do
with
giving
up
the
land
that
should
provide
for
our
own
children
silas
is
it
providing
for
them
to
give
them
a
better
world
to
live
in
felix
you
young
i
ask
you
ai
it
providing
for
them
to
give
them
a
chance
to
be
more
than
we
are
felix
i
think
you
entirely
right
uncle
silas
but
it
the
practical
question
that
silas
if
you
right
the
practical
question
is
just
a
thing
to
fix
up
fejevary
i
fear
you
do
realize
the
immense
amount
of
money
required
to
finance
a
college
the
land
would
be
a
start
you
would
have
to
interest
rich
men
you
have
to
have
a
community
in
sympathy
with
the
thing
you
wanted
to
do
grandmother
ca
you
see
silas
that
we
all
against
you
silas
all
against
me
fejevary
but
how
can
you
be
look
at
the
land
we
walked
in
and
took
was
there
ever
such
a
chance
to
make
life
more
why
the
buffalo
here
before
us
was
more
than
we
if
we
do
nothing
but
prosper
god
damn
us
if
we
sit
here
rich
and
fat
and
forget
man
in
the
makin
against
there
will
one
day
be
a
college
in
these
cornfields
by
the
mississippi
because
long
ago
a
great
dream
was
fought
for
in
hungary
and
i
say
to
that
old
dream
wake
up
old
dream
wake
up
and
fight
you
say
rich
men
it
out
but
it
is
not
i
give
you
this
deed
to
take
to
rich
men
to
show
them
one
man
believes
enough
in
this
to
give
the
best
land
he
got
that
ought
to
make
rich
men
stop
and
think
grandmother
stop
and
think
he
a
fool
silas
fejevary
it
you
can
make
them
know
he
not
a
fool
when
you
tell
this
way
you
can
tell
it
they
feel
in
you
what
more
than
them
they
listen
grandmother
i
tell
you
silas
folks
are
too
busy
silas
too
busy
too
busy
bein
nothin
if
it
true
that
we
created
ourselves
out
of
the
thoughts
that
came
then
thought
is
not
something
the
business
of
life
thought
his
gift
for
why
thought
our
chance
i
know
now
why
i
ca
forget
the
indians
we
killed
their
joy
before
we
killed
them
we
made
them
less
fejevary
as
if
sure
he
is
now
making
it
i
got
to
give
it
back
their
hill
i
give
it
back
to
joy
a
better
joy
joy
fejevary
but
but
my
friend
there
are
men
who
have
no
aspiration
that
why
to
me
this
is
as
a
light
shining
from
too
far
grandmother
things
waked
in
light
shining
from
far
we
used
to
do
that
we
never
pulled
the
curtain
i
used
to
want
to
you
like
to
be
to
yourself
when
night
conies
but
we
always
left
a
lighted
window
for
the
traveller
who
lost
his
way
felix
i
should
think
that
would
have
exposed
you
to
the
indians
grandmother
yes
well
you
ca
put
out
a
light
just
because
it
may
light
the
wrong
person
fejevary
no
this
is
as
a
light
to
him
he
turns
to
the
no
silas
gentleness
and
that
it
look
again
maybe
your
eyes
are
stronger
now
do
you
see
it
i
see
that
college
rising
as
from
the
soil
itself
as
if
it
was
what
come
at
the
last
of
that
thinking
that
breathes
from
the
earth
i
see
it
but
i
want
to
know
real
before
i
stop
knowing
then
maybe
i
can
lie
under
the
same
sod
with
the
red
boys
and
not
be
ashamed
we
not
old
let
fight
wake
in
other
men
what
you
woke
in
me
fejevary
and
so
could
i
pay
my
debt
to
america
hand
goes
silas
him
the
and
to
the
dreams
of
a
million
years
near
the
open
door
their
hands
are
gripped
in

upon
the
occasion
of
the
fortieth
anniversary
of
its
founding

is
an
open
place
in
the
stacks
of
books
which
are
seen
at
both
sides
there
is
a
before
the
big
rear
window
this
window
opens
out
but
does
not
extend
to
the
floor
only
a
part
of
its
height
is
seen
indicating
a
very
high
window
outside
is
seen
the
top
of
a
tree
this
outer
wall
of
the
building
is
on
a
slant
so
that
the
entrance
right
is

is
a
section
of
a
huge
square
column
on
the
rear
of
this
facing
the
window
is
hung
a
picture
of
silas
morton
two
men
are
standing
before
this
senator
lewis
the
midwestern
state
senator
he
is
not
of
the
city
from
which
morton
college
rises
but
of
a
more
country
community
farther
felix
fejevary
nearing
the
age
of
his
father
in
the
first
act
is
an
american
of
the
more
sophisticated
type
prosperous
having
the
poise
of
success
in
affairs
and
place
in
senator
and
this
was
the
boy
who
founded
the
place
eh
it
was
his
idea
fejevary
yes
and
his
hill
i
was
there
the
afternoon
he
told
my
father
there
must
be
a
college
here
i
was
any
older
then
than
my
boy
is
now
if
himself
surprised
by
senator
well
he
enlisted
a
good
man
when
he
let
you
in
on
it
been
told
the
college
would
be
what
it
is
today
but
for
you
mr
fejevary
fejevary
i
have
a
sentiment
about
it
and
where
our
sentiment
is
there
our
work
goes
also
senator
yes
well
it
was
those
mainsprings
of
sentiment
that
won
the
war
is
pleased
with
fejevary
morton
college
did
her
part
in
winning
the
war
senator
i
know
a
fine
showing
fejevary
and
we
holding
up
our
end
right
along
you
see
the
boys
drill
this
afternoon
it
a
great
place
for
them
here
on
the
hill
shows
up
from
so
far
around
they
a
fine
lot
of
fellows
you
know
i
presume
that
they
went
in
as
during
the
trouble
down
here
at
the
steel
works
the
plant
would
have
had
to
close
but
for
morton
college
that
one
reason
i
venture
to
propose
this
thing
of
a
state
appropriation
for
enlargement
why
do
we
sit
down
a
moment
there
no
conflict
with
the
state
university
they
have
their
territory
we
have
ours
ours
is
an
important
one
industrially
speaking
the
state
will
lose
nothing
in
having
a
good
strong
college
here
a
college
senator
i
admit
i
am
very
favourably
impressed
fejevary
i
hope
you
tell
your
committee
so
and
let
me
have
a
chance
to
talk
to
them
senator
let
see
have
you
a
pretty
radical
man
here
fejevary
i
wonder
if
you
mean
holden
senator
holden
the
man
i
read
things
that
make
me
question
his
americanism
fejevary
oh
of
i
do
think
he
is
so
much
a
radical
as
a
particularly
human
senator
but
we
do
want
radical
human
beings
fejevary
he
has
a
genuine
sympathy
with
youth
that
invaluable
in
a
teacher
you
know
and
then
he
a
scholar
betrays
here
his
feeling
of
superiority
to
his
companion
but
too
subtly
for
his
companion
to
get
senator
oh
scholar
we
can
get
scholars
enough
what
we
want
is
americans
fejevary
americans
who
are
scholars
senator
you
can
pick
off
every
bush
pay
them
a
little
more
than
they
paid
in
some
other
cheap
john
college
excuse
me
i
do
mean
this
is
a
cheap
john
college
fejevary
of
course
not
one
could
think
that
of
morton
college
but
that
pay
them
a
little
more
interests
me
that
another
reason
i
want
to
talk
to
your
committee
on
appropriations
we
claim
to
value
education
and
then
we
let
highly
trained
gifted
men
fall
behind
the
plumber
senator
well
that
the
plumber
fault
let
the
teachers
talk
to
the
plumber
fejevary
a
no
better
not
let
them
talk
to
the
plumber
he
might
tell
them
what
to
do
about
it
in
fact
is
telling
them
senator
that
ridiculous
they
ca
serve
both
god
and
mammon
fejevary
then
let
god
give
them
mammon
i
mean
let
the
state
appropriate
senator
of
course
this
state
mr
fejevary
appropriates
no
money
for
radicals
excuse
me
but
why
do
you
keep
this
man
holden
fejevary
in
the
scholar
world
we
known
because
of
him
and
really
holden
not
a
radical
in
the
worst
sense
what
he
does
see
is
expediency
not
enough
the
man
of
affairs
to
realize
that
we
always
have
literally
what
we
have
theoretically
he
an
idealist
something
of
the
man
of
vision
senator
if
he
had
the
right
vision
he
see
that
we
do
every
minute
have
literally
what
we
have
theoretically
because
we
fighting
to
keep
the
thing
we
have
oh
i
sometimes
think
the
man
of
affairs
has
the
only
vision
take
you
mr
fejevary
a
banker
these
teachers
books
books
all
books
why
if
they
had
to
take
for
one
day
the
responsibility
that
falls
on
your
shoulders
big
decisions
to
make
man
among
men
and
all
the
time
worries
irritations
particularly
now
with
labour
riding
the
high
horse
like
a
fool
i
know
something
about
these
things
i
went
to
the
state
house
because
my
community
persuaded
me
it
was
my
duty
but
i
the
man
of
affairs
myself
fejevary
oh
yes
i
know
your
company
did
much
to
develop
that
whole
northern
part
of
the
state
senator
i
think
i
may
say
we
did
well
that
why
after
three
sessions
i
chairman
of
the
appropriations
committee
i
know
how
to
use
money
to
promote
the
state
so
teacher
that
would
be
a
perpetual
vacation
to
me
now
if
you
want
my
advice
mr
fejevary
i
think
your
case
before
the
state
would
be
stronger
if
you
let
this
fellow
holden
go
fejevary
i
going
to
have
a
talk
with
professor
holden
senator
tell
him
it
for
his
own
good
the
idea
of
a
college
professor
standing
up
for
conscientious
objectors
fejevary
that
does
quite
state
the
case
fred
jordan
was
one
of
holden
students
a
student
he
valued
he
felt
jordan
was
perfectly
sincere
in
his
objection
senator
sincere
in
his
objections
the
nerve
of
him
thinking
it
was
his
business
to
be
sincere
fejevary
he
was
expelled
from
college
you
may
remember
that
was
how
we
felt
about
it
senator
i
should
hope
so
fejevary
holden
fought
that
but
within
the
college
what
brought
him
into
the
papers
was
his
protest
against
the
way
the
boy
has
been
treated
in
prison
senator
what
the
difference
how
he
treated
you
know
how
i
treat
him
movement
as
though
pulling
a
if
i
did
know
you
for
the
american
you
are
i
would
understand
your
speaking
so
calmly
fejevary
i
simply
trying
to
see
it
all
sides
around
senator
makes
me
see
red
fejevary
a
but
we
must
meet
red
with
red
senator
what
holden
fussing
about
that
they
do
give
him
caviare
on
toast
fejevary
that
they
did
give
him
books
holden
felt
it
was
his
business
to
fuss
about
that
senator
well
when
your
own
boy
of
whining
around
about
his
conscience
stood
up
and
offered
his
life
fejevary
yes
and
my
nephew
gave
his
life
senator
that
so
fejevary
silas
morton
grandson
died
in
france
my
sister
madeline
married
ira
morton
son
of
silas
morton
senator
i
knew
there
was
a
family
connection
between
you
and
the
mortons
fejevary
with
they
played
together
as
children
and
married
as
soon
as
they
were
grown
up
senator
so
this
was
your
sister
boy
fejevary
one
of
the
mothers
to
give
her
son
fejevary
of
her
with
my
sister
died
long
ago
to
an
old
feeling
with
an
effort
releasing
but
ira
is
still
out
at
the
old
place
place
the
mortons
took
up
when
they
reached
the
end
of
their
trail
as
uncle
silas
used
to
put
it
why
a
hundred
years
ago
that
grandmother
morton
began
making
cookies
here
she
was
the
first
white
woman
in
this
country
senator
proud
woman
to
have
begun
the
life
of
this
state
oh
our
pioneers
if
they
could
only
see
us
now
and
know
what
they
did
fejevary
silent
he
does
not
look
quite
i
suppose
silas
morton
son
is
active
in
the
college
management
fejevary
no
ira
is
not
a
social
being
fred
death
about
finished
him
he
had
been
strange
for
years
ever
since
my
sister
died
when
the
children
were
little
it
was
pulled
back
to
that
old
under
pretty
terrible
circumstances
senator
i
can
see
that
you
thought
a
great
deal
of
your
sister
mr
fejevary
fejevary
oh
she
was
beautiful
and
it
should
have
gone
like
that
senator
seems
to
me
i
heard
something
about
silas
son
though
perhaps
it
was
this
one
fejevary
ira
is
the
only
one
living
here
now
the
others
have
gone
farther
west
senator
is
there
something
about
corn
fejevary
yes
his
corn
has
several
years
taken
the
prize
best
in
the
state
he
experimented
with
it
created
a
new
kind
they
given
it
his
name
morton
corn
it
seems
corn
is
rather
fascinating
to
work
with
very
mutable
stuff
it
a
good
thing
ira
has
it
for
it
about
the
only
thing
he
does
care
for
now
oh
madeline

course

has
a
daughter

like
to
have

great
girl
though
peculiar
senator

makes
a
girl
interesting
if
she
is
peculiar

wrong
way
sounds
as
if
her
home
life
might
make
her
a
little
peculiar
fejevary
madeline

two
young
hindus
here

preach
the
gospel
of
free
india
india
senator
oh
that
wo
do
horace
they
nothing
but
reds
i
say

one
of

three
of

one
of
them

wanted
back

senator
i
remember
now
he
to
be
deported
horace
and
when
they
get
him
as
of
pulling
a
they
hang
there
fejevary
the
other
two
protest
against
our
not
fighting
the
deportation
of
their
comrade
they
insist
it
means
death
to
him
off
a
thing
that
is
inclined
to
worry
but
we
ca
handle
affairs
senator
i
should
think
not
horace
why
england
our
ally
that
what
i
told
them
but
you
argue
with
people
like
that
just
wait
till
i
find
the
speeches
of
abraham
lincoln
through
to
senator
fine
boy
you
have
mr
fejevary
fejevary
he
a
live
one
you
should
see
him
in
a
football
game
would
hurt
my
feelings
in
the
least
to
have
him
a
little
more
of
a
student
but
senator
oh
well
you
want
him
to
be
a
regular
fellow
do
you
and
grow
into
a
man
among
men
fejevary
he
do
that
i
think
it
was
he
who
organized
our
boys
for
the
steel
strike
went
right
in
himself
and
took
a
striker
job
he
came
home
with
a
black
eye
one
night
presented
to
him
by
a
picket
who
started
something
by
calling
him
a
scab
but
horace
was
thinking
about
his
eye
according
to
him
it
was
not
in
the
class
with
the
striker
upper
lip
he
said
gave
him
more
red
than
he
could
swallow
the
blood
just
well
i
spare
you
but
muscle
is
one
hundred
per
cent
american
to
the
let
me
show
you
something
you
can
see
the
old
morton
place
off
on
that
first
little
hill
the
first
rise
beyond
the
valley
senator
the
long
low
house
fejevary
that
it
you
see
the
town
for
the
most
part
swung
around
the
other
side
of
the
hill
so
the
morton
place
is
still
a
farm
senator
but
you
growing
all
the
while
the
town
take
the
cornfield
yet
fejevary
yes
our
steel
works
is
making
us
a
city
senator
and
this
old
boy
to
the
portrait
silas
morton
can
look
out
on
his
old
home
and
watch
the
valley
grow
fejevary
yes
that
was
my
idea
his
picture
really
should
be
in
memorial
hall
but
i
thought
uncle
silas
would
like
to
be
up
here
among
the
books
and
facing
the
old
place
a
i
confess
to
being
a
little
sentimental
senator
we
americans
have
lots
of
sentiment
mr
fejevary
it
what
makes
us
what
we
are
fejevary
not
speak
there
are
times
when
the
senator
seems
to
trouble
well
this
is
a
great
site
for
a
college
you
can
see
it
from
the
whole
country
round
fejevary
yes
that
was
uncle
silas
idea
he
had
a
reverence
for
education
it
grew
in
part
out
of
his
feeling
for
my
father
he
was
a
poet
really
uncle
silas
at
the
he
gave
this
hill
for
a
college
that
we
might
become
a
deeper
more
sensitive
people
girls
convulsed
with
the
giggles
come
tumbling
doris
oh
oh
excuse
us
fussie
we
did
know
anybody
was
here
mr
fejevary
at
them
sternly
the
girls
senator
oh
well
girls
will
be
girls
i
got
three
of
my
own
horace
back
carrying
an
open
horace
say
this
must
be
a
misprint
fejevary
at
the
back
of
the
oh
i
think
not
horace
from
his
first
inaugural
address
to
congress
march
country
with
its
institutions
belong
to
the
people
who
inhabit
it
well
that
all
right
they
shall
grow
weary
of
the
existing
government
they
can
exercise
their
constitutional
right
of
amending
it
a
brief
i
suppose
that
that
all
right
but
listen
their
revolutionary
right
to
dismember
or
overthrow
it
fejevary
he
was
speaking
in
another
age
an
age
of
different
values
senator
terms
change
their
significance
from
generation
to
generation
horace
i
suppose
they
do
but
that
puts
me
in
bad
with
these
lice
they
quoted
this
and
i
said
they
were
liars
senator
and
what
the
idea
they
weary
of
our
existing
government
and
are
about
to
dismember
or
overthrow
it
horace
i
guess
that
the
dope
fejevary
look
here
horace
speak
accurately
was
it
in
relation
to
america
they
quoted
this
horace
well
maybe
they
were
talking
about
india
then
but
they
were
standing
up
for
being
revolutionists
we
were
giving
them
an
earful
about
it
and
then
they
spring
lincoln
on
us
got
their
nerve
say
quoting
lincoln
to
us
senator
the
fact
that
they
are
quoting
it
shows
it
being
misapplied
horace
i
tell
them
that
but
gee
lincoln
oughta
been
more
careful
what
he
said
ignorant
people
do
know
how
to
take
such
things
back
with
fejevary
want
to
take
a
look
through
the
rest
of
the

a
bit
bored
with
him
senator
bored
with

proud
to

hindus
i
told
them
to
keep
their
mouths
shut
about
abraham
lincoln
i
told
them
the
fact
they
were
quoting
him
fejevary
never
mind
what
you
told
them
what
happened
horace
we
started
to
rustle
them
along
a
bit
why
they
had
one
up
as
if
presenting
incriminating
evidence
senator
it
from
telling
america
what
to
do
about
deportation
not
on
this
campus
i
say
so
we
were
we
were
putting
a
stop
to
it
they
resisted
particularly
the
fat
one
the
cop
at
the
corner
saw
the
row
came
up
he
took
hold
of
bakhshish
and
when
the
dirty
anarchist
did
move
along
fast
enough
he
took
hold
of
him
well
a
bit
rough
you
might
say
when
up
rushes
madeline
and
calls
to
the
cop
that
boy
alone
gee
i
do
know
just
what
did
happen
awful
next
thing
i
knew
madeline
hauled
off
and
pasted
the
policeman
a
fierce
one
with
her
tennis
racket
senator
she
the
officer
horace
i
should
say
she
did
twice
the
second
time
aunt
isabel
at
her
i
i
ca
believe
it
horace
i
could
have
squared
it
even
then
but
for
madeline
herself
i
told
the
policeman
that
she
did
understand
that
i
was
her
cousin
and
apologized
for
her
and
she
called
over
at
me
apologize
for
yourself
as
if
there
was
any
sense
to
that
that
she
she
looked
like
a
honest
everybody
was
afraid
of
her
i
kept
right
on
trying
to
square
it
told
the
cop
she
was
the
granddaughter
of
the
man
that
founded
the
college
that
you
were
her
uncle
he
would
have
gone
off
with
just
the
hindu

this
up
later
but
madeline
balled
it
up
again
did
care
who
was
her
uncle
gee

such
a
girl
senator
if

at
the
table

before
him
he
is
a
man
in
the
fifties
at
the
moment
his
face
is
lighted
by
that
lift
of
the
spirit
which
sometimes
rewards
the
scholar
who
has
imaginative
harry
student
clerk

back
a
moment
mr
fejevary
he
has
his
hat
gloves
stick
seems
tired
and
holden
was
i
mistaken
i
thought
our
appointment
was
for
five
fejevary
quite
right
but
things
have
changed
so
i
wondered
if
i
might
have
a
little
talk
with
you
now
holden
to
be
sure
shall
we
go
downstairs
fejevary
i
do

and
quiet
up
here

and
there
no
one

i
been
all
through
fejevary
there
a
committee
downstairs

is
a
terrible
day

things
on
the
we
better
stay
up
here
harry
when
my
niece
when
miss
morton

i
want
you
to
come

let
me

her
not
to
leave
the
building
without
seeing
me
harry
yes
sir

well
it
been
a
day
not
the
day
i
was
looking
for
holden
no
fejevary
you
very
serene
up
here
holden
yes
i
wanted
to
be
serene
for
a
little
while
fejevary
at
the
emerson
whitman
a
have
they
anything
new
to
say
on
economics
holden
perhaps
not
but
i
wanted
to
forget
economics
for
a
time
i
came
up
here
by
myself
to
try
and
celebrate
the
fortieth
anniversary
of
the
founding
of
morton
college
the
other
man
yes
i
confess
i
been
disappointed
in
the
anniversary
as
i
left
memorial
hall
after
the
exercises
this
morning
emerson
words
came
into
my
mind
me
truth
for
i
am
tired
of
surfaces
and
die
of
inanition
well
then
i
went
home
fejevary
how
is
mrs
holden
holden
better
thank
you
but
not
strong
fejevary
she
needs
the
very
best
of
care
for
a
time
does
she
holden
yes
a
then
this
is
something
more
than
the
fortieth
anniversary
you
know
it
the
first
of
the
month
fejevary
and
illness
has
reduced
the
bills
holden
his
i
did
want
this
day
to
go
like
that
so
i
came
up
here
to
try
and
touch
what
used
to
be
here
fejevary
but
you
speak
despondently
of
us
and
there
been
such
a
fine
note
of
optimism
in
the
exercises
with
the
heartiness
of
one
who
would
keep
himself
holden
i
did
seem
to
want
a
fine
note
of
optimism
i
wanted
a
gleam
from
reality
fejevary
to
me
this
is
reality
the
robust
spirit
created
by
all
these
young
people
holden
do
you
think
it
is
robust
affectionately
on
the
book
before
i
been
reading
whitman
fejevary
this
day
has
to
be
itself
certain
things
go
others
come
life
is
change
holden
perhaps
it
myself
i
discouraged
with
do
you
remember
the
tenth
anniversary
of
the
founding
of
morton
college
fejevary
the
tenth
oh
yes
that
was
when
this
library
was
opened
holden
i
shall
never
forget
your
father
mr
fejevary
as
he
stood
out
there
and
said
the
few
words
which
gave
these
books
to
the
students
not
many
books
but
he
seemed
to
baptize
them
in
the
very
spirit
from
which
books
are
born
fejevary
he
died
the
following
year
holden
one
felt
death
near
but
that
did
seem
the
important
thing
a
student
who
had
fought
for
liberty
for
mind
of
course
his
face
would
be
sensitive
you
must
be
very
proud
of
your
heritage
fejevary
yes
little
well
i
have
certainly
worked
for
the
college
i
doing
my
best
now
to
keep
it
a
part
of
these
times
holden
if
this
has
not
reached
it
was
later
that
same
afternoon
i
talked
with
silas
morton
we
stood
at
this
window
and
looked
out
over
the
valley
to
the
lower
hill
that
was
his
home
he
told
me
how
from
that
hill
he
had
for
years
looked
up
to
this
one
and
why
there
had
to
be
a
college
here
i
never
felt
america
as
that
old
farmer
made
me
feel
it
fejevary
by
this
then
shifting
in
irritation
because
he
is
i
sorry
to
break
in
with
practical
things
but
alas
i
am
a
practical
man
forced
to
be
i
too
have
made
a
fight
though
the
fight
to
finance
never
appears
an
idealistic
one
but
i
deep
in
that
now
and
i
must
have
a
little
help
at
least
i
must
not
have
holden
am
i
a
fejevary
candidly
a
you
are
a
little
hard
to
finance
here
the
situation
the
time
for
being
a
little
college
has
passed
we
must
take
our
place
as
one
of
the
important
colleges
i
make
bold
to
say
one
of
the
important
universities
of
the
middle
west
but
we
have
to
enlarge
before
we
can
grow
holden
yes
it
is
ironic
but
that
the
way
of
it
it
was
a
nice
thing
to
open
the
anniversary
with
fifty
thousand
from
the
steel
works
but
fifty
thousand
dollars
nowadays
to
an
institution
the
fifty
thousand
they
do
more
later
i
think
when
they
see
us
coming
into
our
own
meanwhile
as
you
know
there
this
chance
for
an
appropriation
from
the
state
i
find
that
the
legislature
the
members
who
count
are
very
friendly
to
morton
college
they
like
the
spirit
we
have
here
well
now
i
come
to
you
and
you
are
one
of
the
big
reasons
for
my
wanting
to
put
this
over
your
salary
makes
me
blush
it
all
wrong
that
a
man
like
you
should
have
these
petty
worries
particularly
with
mrs
holden
so
in
need
of
the
things
a
little
money
can
do
now
this
man
lewis
is
a
reactionary
so
naturally
he
does
approve
of
you
holden
so
naturally
i
am
to
go
fejevary
go
not
at
all
what
have
i
just
been
saying
holden
be
silent
then
fejevary
not
that
either
not
not
really
but
be
a
little
more
discreet
him
this
is
what
i
want
to
put
up
to
you
why
not
give
things
a
chance
to
mature
in
your
own
mind
candidly
i
do
feel
you
know
just
what
you
do
think
is
it
so
awfully
important
to
express
confusion
holden
the
only
man
who
knows
just
what
he
thinks
at
the
present
moment
is
the
man
who
has
done
any
new
thinking
in
the
past
ten
years
fejevary
a
soothing
you
and
i
need
quarrel
about
it
i
understand
you
but
i
find
it
a
little
hard
to
interpret
you
to
a
man
like
lewis
holden
then
why
not
let
a
man
like
lewis
go
to
thunder
fejevary
and
let
the
college
go
to
thunder
i
not
willing
to
do
that
i
made
a
good
many
sacrifices
for
this
college
given
more
money
than
i
could
afford
to
give
given
time
and
thought
that
i
could
have
used
for
personal
gain
holden
that
true
i
know
fejevary
i
do
know
just
why
i
done
it
sentiment
i
suppose
i
had
a
very
strong
feeling
about
my
father
professor
holden
and
this
friend
silas
morton
this
college
is
the
child
of
that
friendship
those
are
noble
words
in
our
manifesto
college
was
born
because
there
came
to
this
valley
a
man
who
held
his
vision
for
mankind
above
his
own
advantage
and
because
that
man
found
in
this
valley
a
man
who
wanted
beauty
for
his
as
he
wanted
no
other
thing
holden
it
of
the
fight
for
freedom
and
the
aspiration
to
richer
living
we
believe
that
morton
college
rising
as
from
the
soil
itself
may
strengthen
all
those
here
and
everywhere
who
fight
for
the
life
there
is
in
freedom
and
may
to
the
measure
it
can
loosen
for
america
the
beauty
that
breathes
from
knowledge
by
the
words
he
has
do
you
know
i
would
rather
do
that
really
do
that
than
grow
big
fejevary
yes
but
you
see
or
rather
what
you
do
see
is
you
have
to
look
at
the
world
in
which
you
find
yourself
the
only
way
to
stay
alive
is
to
grow
big
it
been
hard
but
i
have
tried
to
carry
on
holden
and
so
have
i
tried
to
carry
on
but
it
is
very
hard
carrying
on
a
dream
fejevary
well
i
trying
to
make
it
easier
holden
make
it
easier
by
destroying
the
dream
fejevary
not
at
all
what
i
want
is
scope
for
dreams
holden
are
you
sure
we
have
the
dreams
after
we
paid
this
price
for
the
scope
fejevary
now
let
not
get
rhetorical
with
one
another
holden
mr
fejevary
you
have
got
to
let
me
be
as
honest
with
you
as
you
say
you
are
being
with
me
you
have
got
to
let
me
say
what
i
feel
fejevary
certainly
that
why
i
wanted
this
talk
with
you
holden
you
say
you
have
made
sacrifices
for
morton
college
so
have
fejevary
how
well
i
know
that
holden
you
do
know
all
of
it
i
not
sure
you
understand
any
of
it
fejevary
oh
i
think
you
hard
on
me
holden
i
spoke
of
the
tenth
anniversary
i
was
a
young
man
then
just
home
from
athens
back
into
an
old
i
do
know
why
i
felt
i
had
to
go
to
greece
i
knew
then
that
i
was
going
to
teach
something
within
sociology
and
i
did
want
anything
i
felt
about
beauty
to
be
left
out
of
what
i
formulated
about
society
the
greeks
fejevary
holden
paused
before
what
he
i
remember
you
told
me
the
greeks
were
the
passion
of
your
student
days
holden
not
so
much
because
they
created
beauty
but
because
they
were
able
to
let
beauty
flow
into
their
lives
to
create
themselves
in
beauty
so
as
a
romantic
young
man
it
seemed
if
i
could
go
where
they
had
been
what
i
had
felt
might
take
form
anyway
i
had
a
wonderful
time
there
oh
what
would
i
give
to
have
again
that
feeling
of
life
infinite
possibilities
fejevary
a
youthful
feeling
holden
i
like
youth
well
i
was
just
back
visiting
my
sister
here
at
the
time
of
the
tenth
anniversary
i
had
a
chance
then
to
go
to
harvard
as
instructor
a
good
chance
for
i
would
have
been
under
a
man
who
liked
me
but
that
afternoon
i
heard
your
father
speak
about
books
i
talked
with
silas
morton
i
found
myself
telling
him
about
greece
no
one
had
ever
felt
it
as
he
felt
it
it
seemed
to
become
of
the
very
bone
of
him
fejevary
i
know
how
he
used
to
do
holden
he
put
his
hands
on
my
shoulders
he
said
man
do
go
away
we
need
you
here
give
us
this
great
thing
you
got
and
so
i
stayed
for
i
felt
that
here
was
soil
in
which
i
could
grow
and
that
one
whole
life
was
not
too
much
to
give
to
a
place
with
roots
like
that
little
forgive
me
if
this
seems
rhetoric
fejevary
gesture
of
protest
silent
a
you
make
it
hard
for
me
do
you
think
i
like
to
indulge
myself
in
an
exalted
mood
and
why
do
i
i
ca
afford
it
not
now
you
have
a
little
patience
and
faith
faith
that
the
thing
we
want
will
be
there
for
us
after
we
worked
our
way
through
the
woods
we
are
in
the
woods
now
it
going
to
take
our
combined
brains
to
get
us
out
i
do
mean
just
morton
college
holden
no
america
as
to
getting
out
i
think
you
are
all
wrong
fejevary
that
one
of
your
sweeping
statements
holden
nobody
all
wrong
even
you
are
holden
and
in
what
ways
am
i
wrong
from
the
standpoint
of
your
senator
lewis
fejevary
he
not
my
senator
lewis
he
the
state
and
we
have
to
take
him
as
he
is
why
he
objects
of
course
to
your
radical
activities
he
spoke
of
your
defence
of
conscientious
objectors
holden
i
think
a
man
who
is
willing
to
go
to
prison
for
what
he
believes
has
stuff
in
him
no
college
needs
turn
its
back
on
fejevary
well
he
does
agree
with
you
nor
do
holden
and
i
think
a
society
which
permits
things
to
go
on
which
i
can
prove
go
on
in
our
federal
prisons
had
better
stop
and
take
a
fresh
look
at
itself
to
stand
for
that
and
then
talk
of
democracy
and
idealism
oh
it
shows
no
mentality
for
one
thing
fejevary
i
presume
the
prisons
do
need
a
cleaning
up
as
to
fred
jordan
you
ca
expect
me
to
share
your
admiration
our
own
fred
my
nephew
fred
morton
went
to
france
and
gave
his
life
some
little
courage
holden
in
doing
that
holden
i
not
trying
to
belittle
it
but
he
had
the
whole
spirit
of
his
age
with
him
fortunate
boy
the
man
who
stands
outside
the
idealism
of
this
time
fejevary
takes
a
good
deal
upon
himself
i
should
say
holden
there
is
any
other
such
loneliness
you
know
in
your
heart
it
a
noble
courage
fejevary
it
lacks
humility
holden
and
i
think
you
lack
it
i
asking
you
to
with
me
for
the
good
of
morton
college
holden
why
not
do
it
the
other
way
you
say
enlarge
that
we
may
grow
that
false
it
is
of
the
nature
of
growth
why
not
do
it
the
way
of
silas
morton
and
walt
whitman
each
man
being
his
purest
and
intensest
self
i
was
full
of
this
fervour
when
you
came
in
i
more
and
more
disappointed
in
our
students
they
empty
flippant
no
sensitive
moment
opens
them
to
beauty
no
exaltation
makes
them
what
they
known
they
were
i
concluded
some
of
the
fault
must
be
mine
the
only
students
i
reach
are
the
hindus
perhaps
madeline
morton
i
do
quite
make
her
out
i
too
must
have
gone
into
a
dead
stratum
but
i
can
get
back
here
alone
this
afternoon
i
was
back
fejevary
i
think
we
have
to
let
the
hindus
go
holden
go
our
best
students
fejevary
this
college
is
for
americans
i
not
going
to
have
foreign
revolutionists
come
here
and
block
the
things
i
spent
my
life
working
for
holden
i
do
seem
to
know
what
you
mean
at
all
fejevary
why
that
disgraceful
performance
this
morning
i
can
settle
madeline
all
right
at
his
she
should
be
here
by
now
but
i
convinced
our
case
before
the
legislature
will
be
stronger
with
the
hindus
out
of
here
holden
well
i
seem
to
have
missed
something
disgraceful
performance
the
hindus
madeline
fejevary
you
mean
to
say
you
do
know
about
the
disturbance
out
here
holden
i
went
right
home
after
the
address
then
came
up
here
alone
fejevary
upon
my
word
you
do
lead
a
serene
life
while
you
been
sitting
here
in
contemplation
i
been
to
the
police
court
trying
to
get
my
niece
out
of
jail
that
what
comes
of
having
radicals
around
holden
what
happened
fejevary
one
of
our
beloved
hindus
made
himself
obnoxious
on
the
campus
giving
out
handbills
about
freedom
for
india
howling
over
deportation
our
american
boys
would
stand
for
it
a
policeman
saw
the
fuss
came
up
and
started
to
put
the
hindu
in
his
place
then
madeline
rushes
in
and
it
ended
in
her
pounding
the
policeman
with
her
tennis
racket
holden
madeline
morton
did
that
fejevary
you
seem
pleased
holden
i
am
interested
fejevary
well
i
not
interested
i
disgusted
my
niece
mixing
up
in
a
fight
and
getting
taken
to
the
police
station
it
the
first
disgrace
we
ever
had
in
our
family
holden
one
who
has
been
given
was
there
another
disgrace
fejevary
what
do
you
mean
holden
when
your
father
fought
his
government
and
was
banished
from
his
country
fejevary
that
was
not
a
disgrace
holden
if
in
was
it
fejevary
see
here
holden
you
ca
talk
to
me
like
that
holden
i
do
admit
you
can
talk
to
me
as
you
please
and
that
i
talk
to
you
i
a
professor
not
a
servant
fejevary
yes
and
you
a
damned
difficult
professor
i
certainly
have
tried
to
holden
handle
me
fejevary
i
ask
you
this
do
you
know
any
other
institution
where
you
could
sit
and
talk
with
the
executive
head
as
you
have
here
with
me
holden
i
do
know
perhaps
not
fejevary
then
be
reasonable
no
one
is
entirely
free
that
naïve
it
rather
egotistical
to
want
to
be
we
held
by
our
relations
to
others
by
our
obligations
to
the
the
ultimate
thing
come
now
you
admit
certain
dissatisfactions
with
yourself
so
why
not
go
with
intensity
into
just
the
things
you
teach
and
not
touch
quite
so
many
other
things
holden
i
could
teach
anything
if
i
did
feel
free
to
go
wherever
that
thing
took
me
thirty
years
ago
i
was
asked
to
come
to
this
college
precisely
because
my
science
was
not
in
isolation
because
of
my
vivid
feeling
of
us
as
a
moment
in
a
long
sweep
because
of
my
faith
in
the
greater
beauty
our
further
living
may
unfold
harry
harry
excuse
me
miss
morton
is
here
now
mr
fejevary
fejevary
ask
her
to
come
up
here
in
five
minutes
harry
i
think
we
thrown
a
scare
into
madeline
i
thought
as
long
as
she
been
taken
to
jail
it
would
be
no
worse
for
us
to
have
her
stay
there
awhile
she
been
held
since
one
that
ought
to
teach
her
reason
holden
is
there
a
case
against
her
fejevary
no
i
got
it
fixed
up
explained
that
it
was
just
college
girl
foolishness
would
happen
again
one
reason
i
wanted
this
talk
with
you
first
if
i
do
have
any
trouble
with
madeline
i
want
you
to
help
me
holden
oh
i
ca
do
that
fejevary
you
are
running
out
and
clubbing
the
police
tell
her
she
have
to
think
things
over
and
express
herself
with
a
little
more
dignity
holden
i
ask
to
be
excused
from
being
present
while
you
talk
with
her
fejevary
but
why
not
stay
in
the
library
in
case
i
should
need
you
just
take
your
books
over
to
the
east
alcove
and
go
on
with
what
you
were
doing
when
i
came
in
holden
a
faint
i
fear
i
can
hardly
do
that
as
to
madeline
fejevary
you
do
want
to
see
the
girl
destroy
herself
do
you
i
confess
i
always
worried
about
madeline
if
my
sister
had
lived
but
madeline
mother
died
you
know
when
she
was
a
baby
her
father
well
you
and
i
talked
that
over
just
the
other
day
there
no
getting
to
him
fred
never
worried
me
a
bit
just
the
fine
normal
boy
but
madeline
an
effort
throwing
it
oh
it
be
all
right
i
have
a
doubt
and
it
be
all
right
between
you
and
me
wo
it
caution
over
a
hard
strip
of
the
road
then
bigger
things
ahead
holden
knowing
what
it
may
i
shall
continue
to
do
all
i
can
toward
getting
fred
jordan
out
of
prison
it
a
disgrace
to
america
that
two
years
after
the
war
closes
he
should
be
kept
there
much
of
the
time
in
solitary
confinement
because
he
believe
in
war
it
small
vengeful
it
the
russia
of
the
czars
i
shall
do
what
is
in
my
power
to
fight
the
deportation
of
gurkul
singh
and
certainly
i
shall
leave
no
stone
unturned
if
you
persist
in
your
amazing
idea
of
dismissing
the
other
hindus
from
college
for
what
i
ask
you
dismissed
for
because
they
love
liberty
enough
to
give
their
lives
to
it
the
day
you
dismiss
them
burn
our
manifesto
mr
fejevary
and
admit
that
morton
college
now
sells
her
soul
to
the
committee
on
appropriations
fejevary
well
you
force
me
to
be
as
specific
as
you
are
if
you
do
these
things
i
can
no
longer
fight
for
you
holden
very
well
then
i
go
fejevary
go
where
holden
i
do
know
at
the
moment
fejevary
i
fear
you
find
it
harder
than
you
know
meanwhile
what
of
your
family
holden
we
will
have
to
manage
some
way
fejevary
it
is
not
easy
for
a
woman
whose
health
in
fact
whose
life
is
a
matter
of
the
best
of
care
to
some
way
real
what
is
an
intellectual
position
alongside
that
reality
like
of
course
to
be
just
what
you
want
to
be
but
is
there
something
selfish
in
that
satisfaction
i
talking
as
a
friend
now
you
must
know
that
you
and
i
have
a
good
many
ties
holden
i
do
believe
you
know
how
much
mrs
fejevary
thinks
of
mrs
holden
holden
she
has
been
very
very
good
to
her
fejevary
and
will
be
she
cares
for
her
and
our
children
have
been
growing
up
together
i
love
to
watch
it
is
that
the
reality
doing
for
them
as
best
we
can
making
sacrifices
of
of
kind
let
some
tenuous
remote
thing
destroy
this
flesh
and
blood
thing
holden
one
fighting
to
keep
his
head
above
honesty
is
not
a
tenuous
remote
thing
fejevary
there
a
kind
of
honesty
in
selfishness
we
ca
always
have
it
oh
i
used
to
go
through
things
but
i
struck
a
pace
one
does
and
goes
ahead
holden
forgive
me
but
i
do
think
you
had
certain
temptations
to
selfishness
fejevary
how
do
you
know
what
i
had
you
have
no
way
of
knowing
what
in
me
what
other
thing
i
might
have
been
you
know
my
heritage
you
think
that
left
nothing
but
i
find
myself
here
in
america
i
love
those
dependent
on
me
my
wife
who
used
to
a
certain
manner
of
living
my
children
who
are
to
become
part
of
the
america
of
their
time
i
never
said
this
to
another
human
being
i
never
looked
at
myself
but
it
pretty
arrogant
to
think
you
the
only
man
who
has
made
a
sacrifice
to
fit
himself
into
the
age
in
which
he
lives
i
hear
madeline
this
has
left
me
in
very
good
form
for
talking
with
her
please
do
go
away
just
madeline
in
right
she
has
her
tennis
racket
nods
to
the
two
holden
out
madeline
holden
something
going
on
then
turning
to
her
uncle
who
is
still
looking
holden
you
wanted
to
speak
to
me
uncle
felix
fejevary
of
course
i
want
to
speak
to
you
madeline
i
feel
just
awfully
sorry
about
banging
up
my
racket
like
this
the
second
time
it
came
down
on
this
club
why
do
they
carry
those
things
perfectly
fantastic
i
say
going
around
with
a
club
but
as
long
as
you
were
asking
me
what
i
wanted
for
my
birthday
fejevary
madeline
i
am
not
here
to
discuss
your
birthday
madeline
i
sorry
to
hear
that
fejevary
you
do
seem
much
chastened
madeline
chastened
was
that
the
idea
well
if
you
think
that
keeping
a
person
where
she
does
want
to
be
chastens
her
i
never
felt
less
than
when
i
walked
out
of
that
slimy
spot
and
looked
across
the
street
at
your
nice
bank
i
should
think
you
hate
to
friendly
why
uncle
felix
you
look
tired
out
fejevary
i
am
tired
out
madeline
i
had
a
day
madeline
is
that
too
bad
those
speeches
were
so
boresome
and
that
old
senator
person
was
he
a
stuff
but
ca
you
go
home
now
and
let
auntie
give
you
tea
and
fejevary
madeline
have
you
no
intelligence
has
it
occurred
to
you
that
your
performance
would
worry
me
a
little
madeline
i
suppose
it
was
a
nuisance
and
on
such
a
busy
day
but
if
you
going
to
worry
horace
is
the
one
you
should
worry
about
his
why
he
got
it
all
up
he
made
me
ashamed
fejevary
and
you
not
at
all
ashamed
of
what
you
have
done
madeline
ashamed
why
no
fejevary
then
you
better
be
a
girl
who
rushes
in
and
assaults
an
officer
madeline
explaining
but
uncle
felix
i
had
to
stop
him
no
one
else
did
fejevary
madeline
i
do
know
whether
you
trying
to
be
naïve
madeline
well
i
i
like
that
i
think
i
go
home
fejevary
i
think
you
will
not
it
stupid
of
you
not
to
know
this
is
serious
you
could
be
dismissed
from
school
for
what
you
did
madeline
well
i
good
and
ready
to
be
dismissed
from
any
school
that
would
dismiss
for
that
fejevary
a
new
manner
quietly
from
madeline
have
you
no
love
for
this
place
madeline
after
yes
i
have
sits
and
i
do
know
why
i
have
fejevary
certainly
it
not
strange
if
ever
a
girl
had
a
background
morton
college
is
madeline
fejevary
morton
background
too
now
seated
by
the
do
you
remember
your
grandfather
morton
madeline
not
very
well
quality
which
seems
i
bear
to
look
at
him
he
shook
so
fejevary
away
real
oh
how
cruel
madeline
cruel
me
cruel
fejevary
not
just
you
the
way
it
passes
so
it
passes
madeline
i
sorry
you
see
he
was
too
old
then
fejevary
hand
up
to
stop
i
wish
i
could
bring
him
back
for
a
moment
so
you
could
see
what
he
was
before
he
shook
so
he
was
a
powerful
man
who
was
as
real
as
the
earth
he
was
strangely
of
the
earth
as
if
something
went
from
it
to
him
at
her
queer
you
should
be
the
one
to
have
no
sentiment
about
him
for
you
and
he
sometimes
when
i
with
you
it
as
if
he
were
near
he
had
no
personal
ambition
madeline
he
was
ambitious
for
the
earth
and
its
people
i
wonder
if
you
can
realize
what
it
meant
to
my
father
in
a
strange
land
where
he
might
so
easily
have
been
misunderstood
pushed
down
to
find
a
friend
like
that
it
was
so
much
the
material
things
though
uncle
silas
was
always
making
them
right
and
as
if
oh
hardly
conscious
what
he
was
doing
so
little
it
mattered
it
was
the
way
he
father
and
by
that
very
valuing
kept
alive
what
was
there
to
value
why
he
literally
laid
this
country
at
my
father
feet
as
if
that
was
what
this
country
was
for
as
if
it
made
up
for
the
hard
early
things
for
the
wrong
things
madeline
he
must
really
have
been
a
pretty
nice
old
party
no
doubt
i
would
have
hit
it
off
with
him
all
right
i
do
seem
to
hit
it
off
with
the
speeches
about
him
somehow
i
want
to
say
give
us
a
rest
fejevary
and
that
i
presume
is
what
you
want
to
say
to
me
madeline
no
no
i
did
mean
you
uncle
though
i
was
wondering
how
you
could
think
you
were
talking
on
your
side
fejevary
what
do
you
mean
my
side
madeline
oh
i
do
exactly
that
nice
about
him
being
of
the
earth
sometimes
when
i
out
for
a
tramp
way
off
by
myself
yes
i
know
and
i
wonder
if
that
does
explain
his
feeling
about
the
indians
father
told
me
how
grandfather
took
it
to
heart
about
the
indians
fejevary
he
felt
it
as
you
feel
it
if
it
were
your
brother
so
he
must
give
his
choicest
land
to
the
thing
we
might
become
maybe
i
can
lie
under
the
same
sod
with
the
red
boys
and
not
be
ashamed
madeline
madeline
yes
that
really
all
right
fejevary
by
what
seems
charily
stated
right
well
i
am
not
willing
to
let
this
man
name
pass
from
our
time
and
it
seems
rather
bitter
that
silas
morton
granddaughter
should
be
the
one
to
stand
in
my
way
madeline
why
uncle
felix
i
not
standing
in
your
way
of
course
i
would
do
that
i
i
love
the
hill
i
was
thinking
about
it
in
jail
i
got
fuddled
on
direction
in
there
so
i
asked
the
woman
who
hung
around
which
way
was
college
hill
through
there
she
said
a
blank
wall
i
sat
and
looked
through
that
wall
long
time
looks
front
again
looking
through
that
blank
it
was
all
kind
of
funny
then
later
she
came
and
told
me
you
were
out
there
and
i
thought
it
was
corking
of
you
to
come
and
tell
them
they
could
put
that
over
on
college
hill
and
i
know
bakhshish
will
appreciate
it
too
i
wonder
where
he
went
fejevary
went
i
fancy
he
wo
go
much
of
anywhere
madeline
what
do
you
mean
fejevary
why
he
held
for
this
hearing
of
course
madeline
you
mean
you
came
and
got
just
me
and
left
him
there
fejevary
certainly
madeline
then
i
have
to
go
and
get
him
fejevary
madeline
do
be
so
absurd
you
do
get
people
out
of
jail
by
stopping
in
and
calling
for
them
madeline
but
you
got
me
fejevary
because
of
years
of
influence
at
that
it
was
simple
things
of
this
nature
are
pretty
serious
nowadays
it
was
only
your
ignorance
got
you
out
madeline
i
do
seem
ignorant
while
you
were
fixing
it
up
for
me
why
did
you
arrange
for
him
too
fejevary
because
i
am
not
in
the
business
of
getting
foreign
revolutionists
out
of
jail
madeline
but
he
did
do
as
much
as
i
did
fejevary
it
is
what
he
did
it
what
he
is
we
do
want
him
here
madeline
well
i
guess
i
not
for
that
fejevary
may
i
ask
why
you
have
appointed
yourself
guardian
of
these
strangers
madeline
perhaps
because
they
are
strangers
fejevary
well
they
the
wrong
kind
of
strangers
madeline
is
it
true
that
the
hindu
who
was
here
last
year
is
to
be
deported
is
america
going
to
turn
him
over
to
the
government
he
fought
fejevary
i
have
an
idea
they
will
all
be
deported
i
not
so
sorry
this
thing
happened
it
will
get
them
into
the
courts
and
i
do
think
they
have
money
to
fight
madeline
it
clean
and
gee
i
think
that
rotten
fejevary
quite
likely
your
inelegance
will
not
affect
it
one
way
or
the
other
madeline
has
taken
her
seat
again
is
thinking
it
next
tuesday
is
it
on
my
birthday
i
get
that
money
grandfather
morton
left
me
fejevary
what
are
you
driving
at
madeline
they
can
have
my
money
fejevary
are
you
crazy
what
these
people
to
you
madeline
they
people
from
the
other
side
of
the
world
who
came
here
believing
in
us
drawn
from
the
far
side
of
the
world
by
things
we
say
about
ourselves
well
i
going
to
pretend
just
for
fun
that
the
things
we
say
about
ourselves
are
true
so
if
you
arrange
so
i
can
get
it
uncle
felix
as
soon
as
it
mine
fejevary
and
this
is
what
you
say
to
me
at
the
close
of
my
years
of
trusteeship
if
you
could
know
how
i
nursed
that
little
legacy
along
until
now
it
is
off
in
i
shall
not
permit
you
to
destroy
yourself
madeline
i
do
see
how
you
can
keep
me
from
myself
fejevary
at
her
seeing
that
this
may
be
true
in
genuine
amazement
and
why
but
it
incredible
have
i
has
my
house
been
nothing
to
you
all
these
years
madeline
i
had
my
best
times
at
your
house
things
would
have
been
very
gay
for
me
without
you
all
though
horace
gets
my
goat
fejevary
and
does
your
aunt
isabel
your
goat
madeline
i
love
auntie
you
know
that
what
has
that
got
to
do
with
it
fejevary
so
you
are
going
to
use
silas
morton
money
to
knife
his
college
madeline
oh
uncle
felix
that
silly
fejevary
it
a
long
way
from
silly
you
know
a
little
about
what
trying
to
do
this
appropriation
that
would
assure
our
future
if
silas
morton
granddaughter
casts
in
her
lot
with
revolutionists
morton
college
will
get
no
help
from
the
state
do
you
know
enough
about
what
you
are
doing
to
assume
this
responsibility
madeline
i
am
not
casting
my
lot
with
revolutionists
if
true
as
you
say
that
you
have
to
have
money
in
order
to
get
justice
fejevary
i
did
say
it
madeline
why
you
did
uncle
felix
you
said
so
and
if
it
true
that
these
strangers
in
our
country
are
going
to
be
abused
because
poor
what
else
could
i
do
with
my
money
and
not
feel
like
a
skunk
fejevary
a
different
tack
oh
you
a
romantic
girl
madeline
skunk
and
all
rather
nice
at
that
but
the
thing
is
perfectly
fantastic
from
every
standpoint
you
speak
as
if
you
had
millions
and
if
you
did
it
would
matter
not
really
you
are
going
against
the
spirit
of
this
country
with
or
without
money
that
ca
be
done
take
a
man
like
professor
holden
he
radical
in
his
sympathies
but
does
he
run
out
and
club
the
police
madeline
a
smouldering
i
thought
america
was
a
democracy
fejevary
we
have
just
fought
a
great
war
for
democracy
madeline
well
is
that
any
reason
for
not
having
it
fejevary
i
should
think
you
would
have
a
little
emotion
about
the
war
about
america
when
you
consider
where
your
brother
is
madeline
fred
had
all
kinds
of
reasons
for
going
to
france
he
wanted
a
trip
his
why
he
so
heavens
fred
did
make
speeches
about
himself
wanted
to
see
paris
poor
kid
he
never
did
see
paris
wanted
to
be
with
a
lot
of
fellows
knock
the
kaiser
block
off
end
war
get
a
french
girl
it
was
all
mixed
up
the
way
things
are
but
fred
was
a
pretty
decent
sort
i
say
so
he
had
such
kind
honest
eyes
has
somehow
said
itself
her
own
eyes
close
and
what
her
shut
eyes
see
makes
feeling
one
thing
i
do
know
fred
never
went
over
the
top
and
out
to
back
up
the
argument
you
making
now
fejevary
very
well
i
will
discontinue
the
argument
making
now
i
been
trying
to
save
you
from
pretty
serious
things
the
regret
of
having
stood
in
the
way
of
morton
college
voice
the
horror
of
having
driven
your
father
insane
madeline
fejevary
one
more
thing
would
do
it
just
the
other
day
i
was
talking
with
professor
holden
about
your
father
his
idea
of
him
relates
back
to
the
pioneer
life
another
price
paid
for
this
country
the
lives
back
of
him
were
too
hard
your
morton
the
first
white
woman
in
this
region
she
dared
too
much
was
too
lonely
feared
and
bore
too
much
they
did
it
for
the
task
gave
them
a
courage
for
the
task
but
it
left
a
scar
madeline
and
father
is
that
hardly
say
scar
the
but
grandfather
morton
was
not
like
that
fejevary
no
he
had
the
vision
of
the
future
he
was
robust
with
feeling
for
others
but
holden
feels
your
father
is
the
dwarfed
pioneer
child
the
way
he
concentrates
on
corn
excludes
all
else
as
if
unable
to
free
himself
from
their
old
battle
with
the
earth
madeline
i
think
it
pretty
terrible
to
wish
all
that
on
poor
father
fejevary
well
my
dear
child
it
life
has
it
on
him
just
one
other
way
of
paying
the
price
for
his
country
we
need
get
it
for
nothing
i
feel
that
all
our
chivalry
should
go
to
your
father
in
his
heritage
of
loneliness
madeline
father
could
always
have
been
dwarfed
mother
have
cared
for
him
if
he
had
always
been
like
that
fejevary
no
if
he
could
have
had
love
to
live
in
but
no
endurance
for
losing
it
too
much
had
been
endured
just
before
life
got
to
him
madeline
do
you
know
uncle
felix
i
afraid
that
true
sometimes
when
i
with
father
i
feel
those
things
near
the
the
too
much
the
too
hard
feel
them
as
you
feel
the
cold
and
now
that
different
easier
he
ca
come
into
the
world
that
been
earned
oh
i
wish
i
could
help
him
they
sit
there
together
now
for
the
first
time
really
together
there
is
a
shrill
shout
of
derision
from
madeline
what
that
whistled
horace
that
horace
call

his
gang
are
they
going
to
start

prisons

old
dish
of

pieces

because
oh
i
do
know
i
had
to
do
something
to
celebrate
my
birthday
aunt
isabel
her
dearie
madeline
and
then
that
did
seem
to
make
a
birthday
so
i
happened
to
see
this
way
up
on
a
top
shelf
and
i
remembered
that
it
was
my
mother
it
was
nice
to
get
it
down
and
use
it
almost
as
if
mother
was
giving
me
a
birthday
present
aunt
isabel
and
how
she
would
love
to
give
you
a
birthday
present
madeline
it
was
her
mother
i
suppose
and
they
brought
it
from
hungary
aunt
isabel
yes
they
brought
only
a
very
few
things
with
them
and
left
oh
so
many
beautiful
ones
behind
madeline
rather
nice
of
them
was
it
aunt
waits
to
leave
their
own
beautiful
things
their
own
beautiful
life
behind
simply
because
they
believed
life
should
be
more
beautiful
for
more
people
aunt
isabel
yes
turning
well
now
as
to
the
birthday
what
do
you
suppose
sarah
is
doing
this
instant
putting
red
frosting
on
white
frosting
it
with
her
madeline
and
what
do
you
suppose
horace
is
doing
a
little
running
around
buying
red
candles
one
to
grow
on
big
birthday
cake
party
madeline
but
auntie
i
do
see
how
i
can
be
there
aunt
isabel
listen
dear
now
we
got
to
use
our
wits
and
all
pull
together
of
course
we
do
anything
in
the
world
rather
than
see
you
left
to
outsiders
i
never
seen
your
uncle
as
worried
and
truly
madeline
as
sad
oh
my
dear
it
these
human
things
that
count
what
would
life
be
without
the
love
we
have
for
each
other
madeline
the
love
we
have
for
each
other
aunt
isabel
why
yes
dearest
do
turn
away
from
me
madeline
do
do
be
strange
i
wonder
if
you
realize
how
your
uncle
has
worked
to
have
life
a
happy
thing
for
all
of
us
be
a
little
generous
to
him
he
had
this
great
burden
of
bringing
something
from
another
day
on
into
this
day
it
is
not
as
simple
as
it
may
seem
he
done
it
as
best
he
could
it
will
hurt
him
as
nothing
has
ever
hurt
him
if
you
now
undo
that
work
of
his
life
truly
dear
do
you
feel
you
know
enough
about
it
to
do
that
another
thing
people
are
a
little
absurd
out
of
their
own
places
we
need
to
be
held
in
our
relationships
against
our
background
or
we
are
i
do
know
grotesque
come
now
madeline
where
your
sense
of
humour
is
it
a
little
absurd
for
you
to
leave
home
over
india
form
of
government
madeline
it
not
india
it
america
a
sense
of
humour
is
nothing
to
hide
behind

a
success
at
world
affairs

to

most
beautiful
things

that
all
you
see
it
in

without
your

all
those
years
count

something
madeline

nothing
to

we
weeping
like

idiots
madeline
away
aunt
isabel
her
veil
regaining
her
usual
professor

hoping

that
do
you
good
anyway
a
talk
with
him
will
be
nice
i
know
he
admires
you
immensely
and
really
perhaps
i
should
let
you
know
this
sympathizes
with
your
feeling
so
i
think
his
maturer
way
of
looking
at
things
will
show
you
just
the
adjustment
you
need
to
become
a
really
big
and
useful
person
there
so
much
to
be
done
in
the
world
madeline
of
course
we
ought
to
make
it
a
better
world
a
manner
of
agreement
madeline
i
feel
very
strongly
about
all
that
perhaps
we
can
do
some
things
together
i
love
that
do
think
i
hopeless
way
down
deep
we
have
the
same
feeling

drinking
it
in
aunt
isabel
you
do
think
the
further
ride
will
be
too
much
holden
oh

that
car
aunt
isabel
then
we
go

perhaps
as
far
as

that
road
and
we
pick
you
up
warmly
she
goes

the
trouble

difficulty
getting
past
how
about
a
little
tramp
there
never
be
another
such
day
madeline
i
used
to
tramp
with
fred
jordan
this
is
where
he
is
now
inside
the
he
does
even
see
out
holden
it
all
wrong
that
he
should
be
where
he
is
but
for
you
to
stay
indoors
wo
help
him
madeline
madeline
it
wo
help
him
but
today
i
ca
go
out
holden
i
sorry
my
child
when
this
sense
of
wrongs
done
first
comes
down
upon
one
it
does
crush
madeline
and
later
you
get
used
to
it
and
do
care
holden
you
care
you
try
not
to
destroy
yourself
needlessly
turns
from
her
madeline
play
safe
holden
if
it
playing
safe
it
that
one
you
love
more
than
yourself
be
safe
it
would
be
a
luxury
to
destroy
one
self
madeline
that
sounds
like
uncle
felix
she
has
hurt
him
she
goes
over
and
sits
across
from
him
at
the
i
sorry
i
say
the
wrong
things
today
holden
i
do
know
that
you
do
madeline
but
is
uncle
funny
his
left
mind
does
know
what
his
right
mind
is
doing
he
has
to
think
of
himself
as
a
person
of
sentiment
idealism
and
quite
a
job
at
times
clever
how
he
gets
away
with
it
the
war
must
have
been
a
godsend
to
people
who
were
in
danger
of
getting
on
to
themselves
but
i
should
think
you
could
fool
all
of
yourself
all
the
time
holden
you
do
is
rubbing
his
hand
on
the
madeline
grandfather
morton
made
this
table
i
suppose
he
and
grandfather
fejevary
used
to
sit
here
and
talk
they
were
great
old
pals
holden
and
looks
out
at
the
yes
how
beautiful
the
hill
must
have
been
before
there
was
a
college
there
looks
away
from
the
did
you
know
grandfather
morton
holden
yes
i
knew
him
of
it
against
his
i
had
a
wonderful
talk
with
him
once
about
greece
and
the
cornfields
and
life
madeline
i
like
to
have
been
a
pioneer
some
ways
they
had
it
fierce
but
think
of
the
fun
they
had
a
whole
big
land
to
open
up
a
big
new
life
to
begin
hands
closing
in
from
wideness
to
a
smaller
why
did
so
much
get
shut
out
just
a
little
way
back
anything
might
have
been
what
happened
holden
with
it
got
set
too
soon
madeline
of
her
mind
open
trying
to
and
why
did
it
prosperous
i
suppose
that
seems
to
set
things
set
them
in
fear
silas
morton
was
afraid
of
felix
fejevary
the
hungarian
revolutionist
he
laid
this
country
at
that
refugee
feet
that
what
uncle
felix
says
himself
with
the
left
half
of
his
mind
now
the
hindu
revolutionists
i
took
a
walk
late
yesterday
afternoon
night
came
and
for
some
reason
i
thought
of
how
many
nights
have
come
nights
the
earth
has
known
long
before
we
knew
the
earth
the
moon
came
up
and
i
thought
of
how
moonlight
made
this
country
beautiful
before
any
man
knew
that
moonlight
was
beautiful
it
gave
me
a
feeling
of
coming
from
something
a
long
way
back
moving
toward
what
will
be
here
when
i
not
here
moving
we
seem
here
now
in
america
to
have
forgotten
we
moving
think
it
just
just
now
of
course
that
would
make
us
afraid
and
ridiculous
father

aunt
isabel

she
go
away
and
leave
you

professor
holden
father
ira
oh
then
you
you
tell
her
what
to
do
you
make
her
do
it
goes
into
the
room
at
madeline
after
a
father
like
something
touched
by
an
early
frost
holden
yes
his
opening
and
forcing
himself
to
take
but
do
you
know
madeline
there
are
other
ways
of
that
happening
by
an
early
frost
i
seen
it
happen
to
people
i
know
people
of
fine
and
daring
mind
they
do
a
thing
that
puts
them
apart
it
may
be
the
big
brave
thing
but
the
apartness
does
something
to
them
i
seen
it
many
times
so
many
times
so
many
times
i
fear
for
you
you
do
this
thing
and
you
find
yourself
with
people
who
in
many
ways
you
care
for
at
all
find
yourself
apart
from
people
who
in
most
ways
are
your
own
people
you
madeline
her
tennis
i
do
know
about
it
all
going
to
one
side
i
hate
to
see
you
so
young
close
a
door
on
so
much
life
i
being
just
as
honest
with
you
as
i
know
how
i
myself
am
making
compromises
to
stay
within
i
do
like
it
but
there
are
reasons
for
doing
it
i
ca
see
you
leave
that
main
body
without
telling
you
all
it
is
you
are
leaving
not
a
case
the
side
of
the
world
or
the
side
of
the
angels
i
hate
to
see
you
lose
the
fullness
of
life
madeline
slight
start
as
she
realizes
the
pause
as
one
recalled
from
i
sorry
i
was
listening
to
what
you
were
saying
but
all
the
time
something
else
was
happening
grandfather
morton
big
and
oh
terrible
he
was
here
and
we
went
to
that
hole
in
the
ground
and
pointing
down
at
the
chalked
where
they
keep
fred
jordan
on
bread
and
water
because
he
could
be
a
part
of
nations
of
men
killing
each
other
and
silas
morton
only
he
was
all
that
is
back
of
us
tore
open
that
cell
it
was
his
voice
tore
it
open
his
voice
as
he
cried
damn
you
this
is
america
down
as
if
rallying
from
a
tremendous
i
sorry
it
should
have
happened
while
you
were
speaking
wo
you
go
on
holden
that
a
pretty
hard
thing
to
go
on
against
a
i
ca
go
on
madeline
you
were
thinking
of
leaving
the
college
and
then
decided
to
stay
and
you
feel
there
more
fullness
of
life
for
you
inside
the
college
than
outside
holden
no
not
exactly
a
it
very
hard
for
me
to
talk
to
you
madeline
perhaps
we
need
do
it
holden
in
him
forcing
him
to
say
i
staying
for
financial
reasons
madeline
but
not
going
to
let
the
truth
get
you
think
that
having
to
stay
within
or
deciding
to
rather
makes
you
think
these
things
of
the
blight
of
being
without
holden
i
think
there
is
danger
to
you
in
so
young
becoming
alien
to
society
madeline
as
great
as
the
danger
of
staying
within
and
becoming
like
the
thing
i
within
holden
you
would
become
like
it
madeline
why
would
i
that
what
it
does
to
the
rest
of
you
i
do
see
it
this
fullness
of
life
business
i
do
see
that
uncle
felix
has
got
it
or
even
aunt
isabel
and
you
i
think
that
in
buying
it
you
losing
it
holden
i
do
think
you
know
what
a
cruel
thing
you
are
saying
madeline
there
must
be
something
pretty
rotten
about
morton
college
if
you
have
to
sell
your
soul
to
stay
in
it
holden
you
do
your
soul
you
persuade
yourself
to
wait
madeline
to
look
at
him
as
if
feeling
you
have
had
a
talk
with
uncle
felix
since
that
day
in
the
library
you
stepped
aside
for
me
to
pass
holden
yes
and
with
my
wife
physician
if
you
sell
your
soul
to
love
you
sell
it
madeline
that
strange
it
love
that
brings
life
along
and
then
it
love
holds
life
back
holden
all
the
time
with
this
effort
against
leaving
me
out
of
it
i
like
to
see
you
give
yourself
a
little
more
chance
for
detachment
you
need
a
better
intellectual
equipment
if
you
going
to
fight
the
world
you
find
yourself
in
i
think
you
will
count
for
more
if
you
wait
and
when
you
strike
strike
more
maturely
madeline
detachment
this
is
one
thing
they
do
at
this
place
moves
to
the
open
chain
them
up
to
the
bars
just
like
this
the
doorway
where
her
two
grandfathers
once
pledged
faith
with
the
dreams
of
a
million
years
she
raises
clasped
hands
as
high
as
they
will
eight
hours
a
day
day
after
day
just
hold
your
arms
up
like
this
one
hour
then
sit
down
and
think
about
if
tortured
by
all
who
have
been
so
tortured
her
body
begins
to
give
with
sobs
arms
drop
the
last
word
is
a
detachment
holden
standing
helplessly
by
when
her
father
comes
ira
do
cry
no
not
in
this
house
i
ca
your
aunt
and
uncle
will
fix
it
up
the
law
wo
take
you
this
time
and
you
wo

it
again

do
to
ira

about

little
and

her
in
the
doorway

hand
rests
an
instant
on
her
bent

too
much
to
break

me
about
her
except
that
she
was
beautiful

feeling
of

from
long
ago

fast
as

rough
field

to
her
knees

much
that
she
never
stopped
to
think
how
much
she
was
worth
ira

you
could
take
it
like
that
and
now
you
cry
about
the
world

my
father

there
at
the
table
and
talk
about
the
world
my
father
and
her
father
they
thought
was
all
for
something
