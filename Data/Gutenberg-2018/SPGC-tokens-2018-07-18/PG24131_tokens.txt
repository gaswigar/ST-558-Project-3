ballinger
is
one
of
the
ladies
who
pursue
culture
in
bands
as
though
it
were
dangerous
to
meet
alone
to
this
end
she
had
founded
the
lunch
club
an
association
composed
of
herself
and
several
other
indomitable
huntresses
of
erudition
the
lunch
club
after
three
or
four
winters
of
lunching
and
debate
had
acquired
such
local
distinction
that
the
entertainment
of
distinguished
strangers
became
one
of
its
accepted
functions
in
recognition
of
which
it
duly
extended
to
the
celebrated
osric
dane
on
the
day
of
her
arrival
in
hillbridge
an
invitation
to
be
present
at
the
next
meeting
the
club
was
to
meet
at
bellinger
s
the
other
members
behind
her
back
were
of
one
voice
in
deploring
her
unwillingness
to
cede
her
rights
in
favor
of
plinth
whose
house
made
a
more
impressive
setting
for
the
entertainment
of
celebrities
while
as
leveret
observed
there
was
always
the
to
fall
back
on
plinth
made
no
secret
of
sharing
this
view
she
had
always
regarded
it
as
one
of
her
obligations
to
entertain
the
lunch
club
s
distinguished
guests
plinth
was
almost
as
proud
of
her
obligations
as
she
was
of
her
she
was
in
fact
fond
of
implying
that
the
one
possession
implied
the
other
and
that
only
a
woman
of
her
wealth
could
afford
to
live
up
to
a
standard
as
high
as
that
which
she
had
set
herself
an
sense
of
duty
roughly
adaptable
to
various
ends
was
in
her
opinion
all
that
providence
exacted
of
the
more
humbly
stationed
but
the
power
which
had
predestined
plinth
to
keep
a
footman
clearly
intended
her
to
maintain
an
equally
specialized
staff
of
responsibilities
it
was
the
more
to
be
regretted
that
ballinger
whose
obligations
to
society
were
bounded
by
the
narrow
scope
of
two
should
have
been
so
tenacious
of
the
right
to
entertain
osric
dane
the
question
of
that
lady
s
reception
had
for
a
month
past
profoundly
moved
the
members
of
the
lunch
club
it
was
not
that
they
felt
themselves
unequal
to
the
task
but
that
their
sense
of
the
opportunity
plunged
them
into
the
agreeable
uncertainty
of
the
lady
who
weighs
the
alternatives
of
a
wardrobe
if
such
subsidiary
members
as
leveret
were
fluttered
by
the
thought
of
exchanging
ideas
with
the
author
of
the
wings
of
death
no
forebodings
disturbed
the
conscious
adequacy
of
plinth
ballinger
and
miss
van
vluyck
the
wings
of
death
had
in
fact
at
miss
van
vluyck
s
suggestion
been
chosen
as
the
subject
of
discussion
at
the
last
club
meeting
and
each
member
had
thus
been
enabled
to
express
her
own
opinion
or
to
appropriate
whatever
sounded
well
in
the
comments
of
the
others
roby
alone
had
abstained
from
profiting
by
the
opportunity
but
it
was
now
openly
recognised
that
as
a
member
of
the
lunch
club
roby
was
a
failure
it
all
comes
as
miss
van
vluyck
put
it
of
accepting
a
woman
on
a
man
s
roby
returning
to
hillbridge
from
a
prolonged
sojourn
in
exotic
lands
the
other
ladies
no
longer
took
the
trouble
to
remember
where
had
been
heralded
by
the
distinguished
biologist
professor
foreland
as
the
most
agreeable
woman
he
had
ever
met
and
the
members
of
the
lunch
club
impressed
by
an
encomium
that
carried
the
weight
of
a
diploma
and
rashly
assuming
that
the
professor
s
social
sympathies
would
follow
the
line
of
his
professional
bent
had
seized
the
chance
of
annexing
a
biological
member
their
disillusionment
was
complete
at
miss
van
vluyck
s
first
mention
of
the
pterodactyl
roby
had
confusedly
murmured
i
know
so
little
about
metres
and
after
that
painful
betrayal
of
incompetence
she
had
prudently
withdrawn
from
farther
participation
in
the
mental
gymnastics
of
the
club
i
suppose
she
flattered
him
miss
van
vluyck
summed
up
or
else
it
s
the
way
she
does
her
the
dimensions
of
miss
van
vluyck
s
having
restricted
the
membership
of
the
club
to
six
the
nonconductiveness
of
one
member
was
a
serious
obstacle
to
the
exchange
of
ideas
and
some
wonder
had
already
been
expressed
that
roby
should
care
to
live
as
it
were
on
the
intellectual
bounty
of
the
others
this
feeling
was
increased
by
the
discovery
that
she
had
not
yet
read
the
wings
of
she
owned
to
having
heard
the
name
of
osric
dane
but
that
incredible
as
it
appeared
was
the
extent
of
her
acquaintance
with
the
celebrated
novelist
the
ladies
could
not
conceal
their
surprise
but
ballinger
whose
pride
in
the
club
made
her
wish
to
put
even
roby
in
the
best
possible
light
gently
insinuated
that
though
she
had
not
had
time
to
acquaint
herself
with
the
wings
of
death
she
must
at
least
be
familiar
with
its
equally
remarkable
predecessor
the
supreme
roby
wrinkled
her
sunny
brows
in
a
conscientious
effort
of
memory
as
a
result
of
which
she
recalled
that
oh
yes
she
seen
the
book
at
her
brother
s
when
she
was
staying
with
him
in
brazil
and
had
even
carried
it
off
to
read
one
day
on
a
boating
party
but
they
had
all
got
to
shying
things
at
each
other
in
the
boat
and
the
book
had
gone
overboard
so
she
had
never
had
the
chance
the
picture
evoked
by
this
anecdote
did
not
increase
roby
s
credit
with
the
club
and
there
was
a
painful
pause
which
was
broken
by
plinth
s
remarking
i
can
understand
that
with
all
your
other
pursuits
you
should
not
find
much
time
for
reading
but
i
should
have
thought
you
might
at
least
have
the
wings
of
death
before
osric
dane
s
roby
took
this
rebuke
she
had
meant
she
owned
to
glance
through
the
book
but
she
had
been
so
absorbed
in
a
novel
of
trollope
s
that
no
one
reads
trollope
now
ballinger
interrupted
roby
looked
pained
i
m
only
just
beginning
she
confessed
and
does
he
interest
you
plinth
enquired
he
amuses
amusement
said
plinth
is
hardly
what
i
look
for
in
my
choice
of
oh
certainly
the
wings
of
death
is
not
amusing
ventured
leveret
whose
manner
of
putting
forth
an
opinion
was
like
that
of
an
obliging
salesman
with
a
variety
of
other
styles
to
submit
if
his
first
selection
does
not
suit
was
it
to
be
enquired
plinth
who
was
fond
of
asking
questions
that
she
permitted
no
one
but
herself
to
answer
assuredly
assuredly
not
that
is
what
i
was
going
to
say
assented
leveret
hastily
rolling
up
her
opinion
and
reaching
for
another
it
was
meant
to
to
miss
van
vluyck
adjusted
her
spectacles
as
though
they
were
the
black
cap
of
condemnation
i
hardly
see
she
interposed
how
a
book
steeped
in
the
bitterest
pessimism
can
be
said
to
elevate
however
much
it
may
i
meant
of
course
to
instruct
said
leveret
flurried
by
the
unexpected
distinction
between
two
terms
which
she
had
supposed
to
be
synonymous
leveret
s
enjoyment
of
the
lunch
club
was
frequently
marred
by
such
surprises
and
not
knowing
her
own
value
to
the
other
ladies
as
a
mirror
for
their
mental
complacency
she
was
sometimes
troubled
by
a
doubt
of
her
worthiness
to
join
in
their
debates
it
was
only
the
fact
of
having
a
dull
sister
who
thought
her
clever
that
saved
her
from
a
sense
of
hopeless
inferiority
do
they
get
married
in
the
end
roby
interposed
they
who
the
lunch
club
collectively
exclaimed
why
the
girl
and
man
it
s
a
novel
isn
t
it
i
always
think
that
s
the
one
thing
that
matters
if
they
re
parted
it
spoils
my
plinth
and
ballinger
exchanged
scandalised
glances
and
the
latter
said
i
should
hardly
advise
you
to
read
the
wings
of
death
in
that
spirit
for
my
part
when
there
are
so
many
books
one
to
read
i
wonder
how
any
one
can
find
time
for
those
that
are
merely
the
beautiful
part
of
it
laura
glyde
murmured
is
surely
just
this
that
no
one
can
tell
how
the
wings
of
death
ends
osric
dane
overcome
by
the
awful
significance
of
her
own
meaning
has
mercifully
veiled
it
perhaps
even
from
herself
as
apelles
in
representing
the
sacrifice
of
iphigenia
veiled
the
face
of
what
s
that
is
it
poetry
whispered
leveret
to
plinth
who
disdaining
a
definite
reply
said
coldly
you
should
look
it
up
i
always
make
it
a
point
to
look
things
her
tone
added
though
i
might
easily
have
it
done
for
me
by
the
i
was
about
to
say
miss
van
vluyck
resumed
that
it
must
always
be
a
question
whether
a
book
instruct
unless
it
oh
murmured
leveret
now
feeling
herself
hopelessly
astray
i
don
t
know
said
ballinger
scenting
in
miss
van
vluyck
s
tone
a
tendency
to
depreciate
the
coveted
distinction
of
entertaining
osric
dane
i
don
t
know
that
such
a
question
can
seriously
be
raised
as
to
a
book
which
has
attracted
more
attention
among
thoughtful
people
than
any
novel
since
robert
oh
but
don
t
you
see
exclaimed
laura
glyde
that
it
s
just
the
dark
hopelessness
of
it
all
the
wonderful
of
black
on
black
that
makes
it
such
an
artistic
achievement
it
reminded
me
when
i
read
it
of
prince
rupert
s
the
book
is
etched
not
painted
yet
one
feels
the
so
intensely
who
is
he
leveret
whispered
to
her
neighbour
some
one
she
s
met
abroad
the
wonderful
part
of
the
book
bellinger
conceded
is
that
it
may
be
looked
at
from
so
many
points
of
view
i
hear
that
as
a
study
of
determinism
professor
lupton
ranks
it
with
the
data
of
i
m
told
that
osric
dane
spent
ten
years
in
preparatory
studies
before
beginning
to
write
it
said
plinth
she
looks
up
everything
verifies
everything
it
has
always
been
my
principle
as
you
know
nothing
would
induce
me
now
to
put
aside
a
book
before
i
d
finished
it
just
because
i
can
buy
as
many
more
as
i
and
what
do
think
of
the
wings
of
death
roby
abruptly
asked
her
it
was
the
kind
of
question
that
might
be
termed
out
of
order
and
the
ladies
glanced
at
each
other
as
though
disclaiming
any
share
in
such
a
breach
of
discipline
they
all
knew
there
was
nothing
plinth
so
much
disliked
as
being
asked
her
opinion
of
a
book
books
were
written
to
read
if
one
read
them
what
more
could
be
expected
to
be
questioned
in
detail
regarding
the
contents
of
a
volume
seemed
to
her
as
great
an
outrage
as
being
searched
for
smuggled
laces
at
the
custom
house
the
club
had
always
respected
this
idiosyncrasy
of
plinth
s
such
opinions
as
she
had
were
imposing
and
substantial
her
mind
like
her
house
was
furnished
with
monumental
pieces
that
were
not
meant
to
be
disarranged
and
it
was
one
of
the
unwritten
rules
of
the
lunch
club
that
within
her
own
province
each
member
s
habits
of
thought
should
be
respected
the
meeting
therefore
closed
with
an
increased
sense
on
the
part
of
the
other
ladies
of
roby
s
hopeless
unfitness
to
be
one
of
them
ii
leveret
on
the
eventful
day
arrived
early
at
ballinger
s
her
volume
of
appropriate
allusions
in
her
pocket
it
always
flustered
leveret
to
be
late
at
the
lunch
club
she
liked
to
collect
her
thoughts
and
gather
a
hint
as
the
others
assembled
of
the
turn
the
conversation
was
likely
to
take
however
she
felt
herself
completely
at
a
loss
and
even
the
familiar
contact
of
appropriate
allusions
which
stuck
into
her
as
she
sat
down
failed
to
give
her
any
reassurance
it
was
an
admirable
little
volume
compiled
to
meet
all
the
social
emergencies
so
that
whether
on
the
occasion
of
anniversaries
joyful
or
melancholy
as
the
classification
ran
of
banquets
social
or
municipal
or
of
baptisms
church
of
england
or
sectarian
its
student
need
never
be
at
a
loss
for
a
pertinent
reference
leveret
though
she
had
for
years
devoutly
conned
its
pages
valued
it
however
rather
for
its
moral
support
than
for
its
practical
services
for
though
in
the
privacy
of
her
own
room
she
commanded
an
army
of
quotations
these
invariably
deserted
her
at
the
critical
moment
and
the
only
phrase
she
retained
thou
draw
out
leviathan
with
a
was
one
she
had
never
yet
found
occasion
to
apply
she
felt
that
even
the
complete
mastery
of
the
volume
would
hardly
have
insured
her
for
she
thought
it
probable
that
even
if
she
in
some
miraculous
way
remember
an
allusion
it
would
be
only
to
find
that
osric
dane
used
a
different
volume
leveret
was
convinced
that
literary
people
always
carried
them
and
would
consequently
not
recognise
her
quotations
leveret
s
sense
of
being
adrift
was
intensified
by
the
appearance
of
ballinger
s
to
a
careless
eye
its
aspect
was
unchanged
but
those
acquainted
with
ballinger
s
way
of
arranging
her
books
would
instantly
have
detected
the
marks
of
recent
perturbation
ballinger
s
province
as
a
member
of
the
lunch
club
was
the
book
of
the
day
on
that
whatever
it
was
from
a
novel
to
a
treatise
on
experimental
psychology
she
was
confidently
authoritatively
what
became
of
last
year
s
books
or
last
week
s
even
what
she
did
with
the
subjects
she
had
previously
professed
with
equal
authority
no
one
had
ever
yet
discovered
her
mind
was
an
hotel
where
facts
came
and
went
like
transient
lodgers
without
leaving
their
address
behind
and
frequently
without
paying
for
their
board
it
was
ballinger
s
boast
that
she
was
abreast
with
the
thought
of
the
day
and
her
pride
that
this
advanced
position
should
be
expressed
by
the
books
on
her
table
these
volumes
frequently
renewed
and
almost
always
damp
from
the
press
bore
names
generally
unfamiliar
to
leveret
and
giving
her
as
she
furtively
scanned
them
a
disheartening
glimpse
of
new
fields
of
knowledge
to
be
breathlessly
traversed
in
ballinger
s
wake
but
a
number
of
volumes
were
adroitly
mingled
with
the
of
the
press
karl
marx
jostled
professor
bergson
and
the
confessions
of
augustine
lay
beside
the
last
work
on
mendelism
so
that
even
to
leveret
s
fluttered
perceptions
it
was
clear
that
ballinger
didn
t
in
the
least
know
what
osric
dane
was
likely
to
talk
about
and
had
taken
measures
to
be
prepared
for
anything
leveret
felt
like
a
passenger
on
an
ocean
steamer
who
is
told
that
there
is
no
immediate
danger
but
that
she
had
better
put
on
her
it
was
a
relief
to
be
roused
from
these
forebodings
by
miss
van
vluyck
s
arrival
well
my
dear
the
briskly
asked
her
hostess
what
subjects
are
we
to
discuss
ballinger
was
furtively
replacing
a
volume
of
wordsworth
by
a
copy
of
verlaine
i
hardly
know
she
said
somewhat
nervously
perhaps
we
had
better
leave
that
to
circumstances
said
miss
van
vluyck
drily
that
means
i
suppose
that
laura
glyde
will
take
the
floor
as
usual
and
we
shall
be
deluged
with
philanthropy
and
statistics
were
miss
van
vluyck
s
province
and
she
resented
any
tendency
to
divert
their
guest
s
attention
from
these
topics
plinth
at
this
moment
appeared
literature
she
protested
in
a
tone
of
remonstrance
but
this
is
perfectly
unexpected
i
understood
we
were
to
talk
of
osric
dane
s
ballinger
winced
at
the
discrimination
but
let
it
pass
we
can
hardly
make
that
our
chief
subject
at
least
not
intentionally
she
suggested
of
course
we
can
let
our
talk
in
that
direction
but
we
ought
to
have
some
other
topic
as
an
introduction
and
that
is
what
i
wanted
to
consult
you
about
the
fact
is
we
know
so
little
of
osric
dane
s
tastes
and
interests
that
it
is
difficult
to
make
any
special
it
may
be
difficult
said
plinth
with
decision
but
it
is
necessary
i
know
what
that
principle
leads
to
as
i
told
one
of
my
nieces
the
other
day
there
are
certain
emergencies
for
which
a
lady
should
always
be
prepared
it
s
in
shocking
taste
to
wear
colours
when
one
pays
a
visit
of
condolence
or
a
last
year
s
dress
when
there
are
reports
that
one
s
husband
is
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
market
and
so
it
is
with
conversation
all
i
ask
is
that
i
should
know
beforehand
what
is
to
be
talked
about
then
i
feel
sure
of
being
able
to
say
the
proper
i
quite
agree
with
you
ballinger
assented
but
and
at
that
instant
heralded
by
the
fluttered
parlourmaid
osric
dane
appeared
upon
the
threshold
leveret
told
her
sister
afterward
that
she
had
known
at
a
glance
what
was
coming
she
saw
that
osric
dane
was
not
going
to
meet
them
half
way
that
distinguished
personage
had
indeed
entered
with
an
air
of
compulsion
not
calculated
to
promote
the
easy
exercise
of
hospitality
she
looked
as
though
she
were
about
to
be
photographed
for
a
new
edition
of
her
books
the
desire
to
propitiate
a
divinity
is
generally
in
inverse
ratio
to
its
responsiveness
and
the
sense
of
discouragement
produced
by
osric
dane
s
entrance
visibly
increased
the
lunch
club
s
eagerness
to
please
her
any
lingering
idea
that
she
might
consider
herself
under
an
obligation
to
her
entertainers
was
at
once
dispelled
by
her
manner
as
leveret
said
afterward
to
her
sister
she
had
a
way
of
looking
at
you
that
made
you
feel
as
if
there
was
something
wrong
with
your
hat
this
evidence
of
greatness
produced
such
an
immediate
impression
on
the
ladies
that
a
shudder
of
awe
ran
through
them
when
roby
as
their
hostess
led
the
great
personage
into
the
turned
back
to
whisper
to
the
others
what
a
brute
she
is
the
hour
about
the
table
did
not
tend
to
revise
this
verdict
it
was
passed
by
osric
dane
in
the
silent
deglutition
of
bollinger
s
menu
and
by
the
members
of
the
club
in
the
emission
of
tentative
platitudes
which
their
guest
seemed
to
swallow
as
perfunctorily
as
the
successive
courses
of
the
luncheon
ballinger
s
reluctance
to
fix
a
topic
had
thrown
the
club
into
a
mental
disarray
which
increased
with
the
return
to
the
where
the
actual
business
of
discussion
was
to
open
each
lady
waited
for
the
other
to
speak
and
there
was
a
general
shock
of
disappointment
when
their
hostess
opened
the
conversation
by
the
painfully
commonplace
enquiry
is
this
your
first
visit
to
hillbridge
even
leveret
was
conscious
that
this
was
a
bad
beginning
and
a
vague
impulse
of
deprecation
made
miss
glyde
interject
it
is
a
very
small
place
plinth
bristled
we
have
a
great
many
representative
people
she
said
in
the
tone
of
one
who
speaks
for
her
order
osric
dane
turned
to
her
what
do
they
represent
she
asked
plinth
s
constitutional
dislike
to
being
questioned
was
intensified
by
her
sense
of
unpreparedness
and
her
reproachful
glance
passed
the
question
on
to
ballinger
why
said
that
lady
glancing
in
turn
at
the
other
members
as
a
community
i
hope
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
we
stand
for
for
art
miss
glyde
interjected
for
art
and
literature
ballinger
emended
and
for
sociology
i
trust
snapped
miss
van
vluyck
we
have
a
standard
said
plinth
feeling
herself
suddenly
secure
on
the
vast
expanse
of
a
generalisation
and
leveret
thinking
there
must
be
room
for
more
than
one
on
so
broad
a
statement
took
courage
to
murmur
oh
certainly
we
have
a
the
object
of
our
little
club
ballinger
continued
is
to
concentrate
the
highest
tendencies
of
hillbridge
to
centralise
and
focus
its
intellectual
this
was
felt
to
be
so
happy
that
the
ladies
drew
an
almost
audible
breath
of
relief
we
aspire
the
president
went
on
to
be
in
touch
with
whatever
is
highest
in
art
literature
and
osric
dane
again
turned
to
her
what
ethics
she
asked
a
tremor
of
apprehension
encircled
the
room
none
of
the
ladies
required
any
preparation
to
pronounce
on
a
question
of
morals
but
when
they
were
called
ethics
it
was
different
the
club
when
fresh
from
the
encyclopaedia
britannica
the
reader
s
handbook
or
smith
s
classical
dictionary
could
deal
confidently
with
any
subject
but
when
taken
unawares
it
had
been
known
to
define
agnosticism
as
a
heresy
of
the
early
church
and
professor
froude
as
a
distinguished
histologist
and
such
minor
members
as
leveret
still
secretly
regarded
ethics
as
something
vaguely
pagan
even
to
ballinger
osric
dane
s
question
was
unsettling
and
there
was
a
general
sense
of
gratitude
when
laura
glyde
leaned
forward
to
say
with
her
most
sympathetic
accent
you
must
excuse
us
dane
for
not
being
able
just
at
present
to
talk
of
anything
but
the
wings
of
yes
said
miss
van
vluyck
with
a
sudden
resolve
to
carry
the
war
into
the
enemy
s
camp
we
are
so
anxious
to
know
the
exact
purpose
you
had
in
mind
in
writing
your
wonderful
you
will
find
plinth
interposed
that
we
are
not
superficial
we
are
eager
to
hear
from
you
miss
van
vluyck
continued
if
the
pessimistic
tendency
of
the
book
is
an
expression
of
your
own
convictions
or
or
merely
miss
glyde
thrust
in
a
sombre
background
brushed
in
to
throw
your
figures
into
more
vivid
relief
you
not
primarily
plastic
i
have
always
maintained
ballinger
interposed
that
you
represent
the
purely
objective
method
osric
dane
helped
herself
critically
to
coffee
how
do
you
define
objective
she
then
enquired
there
was
a
flurried
pause
before
laura
glyde
intensely
murmured
in
reading
we
don
t
define
we
otsric
dane
smiled
the
cerebellum
she
remarked
is
not
infrequently
the
seat
of
the
literary
and
she
took
a
second
lump
of
sugar
the
sting
that
this
remark
was
vaguely
felt
to
conceal
was
almost
neutralised
by
the
satisfaction
of
being
addressed
in
such
technical
language
ah
the
cerebellum
said
miss
van
vluyck
complacently
the
club
took
a
course
in
psychology
last
which
psychology
asked
osric
dane
there
was
an
agonising
pause
during
which
each
member
of
the
club
secretly
deplored
the
distressing
inefficiency
of
the
others
only
roby
went
on
placidly
sipping
her
chartreuse
at
last
ballinger
said
with
an
attempt
at
a
high
tone
well
really
you
know
it
was
last
year
that
we
took
psychology
and
this
winter
we
have
been
so
absorbed
in
she
broke
off
nervously
trying
to
recall
some
of
the
club
s
discussions
but
her
faculties
seemed
to
be
paralysed
by
the
petrifying
stare
of
osric
dane
what
the
club
been
absorbed
in
ballinger
with
a
vague
purpose
of
gaining
time
repeated
slowly
we
ve
been
so
intensely
absorbed
in
roby
put
down
her
liqueur
glass
and
drew
near
the
group
with
a
smile
in
xingu
she
gently
prompted
a
thrill
ran
through
the
other
members
they
exchanged
confused
glances
and
then
with
one
accord
turned
a
gaze
of
mingled
relief
and
interrogation
on
their
rescuer
the
expression
of
each
denoted
a
different
phase
of
the
same
emotion
plinth
was
the
first
to
compose
her
features
to
an
air
of
reassurance
after
a
moment
s
hasty
adjustment
her
look
almost
implied
that
it
was
she
who
had
given
the
word
to
ballinger
xingu
of
course
exclaimed
the
latter
with
her
accustomed
promptness
while
miss
van
vluyck
and
laura
glyde
seemed
to
be
plumbing
the
depths
of
memory
and
leveret
feeling
apprehensively
for
appropriate
allusions
was
somehow
reassured
by
the
uncomfortable
pressure
of
its
bulk
against
her
person
osric
dane
s
change
of
countenance
was
no
less
striking
than
that
of
her
entertainers
she
too
put
down
her
but
with
a
look
of
distinct
annoyance
she
too
wore
for
a
brief
moment
what
roby
afterward
described
as
the
look
of
feeling
for
something
in
the
back
of
her
head
and
before
she
could
dissemble
these
momentary
signs
of
weakness
roby
turning
to
her
with
a
deferential
smile
had
said
and
we
ve
been
so
hoping
that
you
would
tell
us
just
what
you
think
of
osric
dane
received
the
homage
of
the
smile
as
a
matter
of
course
but
the
accompanying
question
obviously
embarrassed
her
and
it
became
clear
to
her
observers
that
she
was
not
quick
at
shifting
her
facial
scenery
it
was
as
though
her
countenance
had
so
long
been
set
in
an
expression
of
unchallenged
superiority
that
the
muscles
had
stiffened
and
refused
to
obey
her
orders
xingu
she
said
as
if
seeking
in
her
turn
to
gain
time
roby
continued
to
press
her
knowing
how
engrossing
the
subject
is
you
will
understand
how
it
happens
that
the
club
has
let
everything
else
go
to
the
wall
for
the
moment
since
we
took
up
xingu
i
might
almost
say
were
it
not
for
your
books
that
nothing
else
seems
to
us
worth
osric
dane
s
stern
features
were
darkened
rather
than
lit
up
by
an
uneasy
smile
i
am
glad
to
hear
that
you
make
one
exception
she
gave
out
between
narrowed
lips
oh
of
course
roby
said
prettily
but
as
you
have
shown
us
that
so
very
naturally
you
don
t
care
to
talk
of
your
own
things
we
really
can
t
let
you
off
from
telling
us
exactly
what
you
think
about
xingu
especially
she
added
with
a
still
more
persuasive
smile
as
some
people
say
that
one
of
your
last
books
was
saturated
with
it
was
an
then
the
assurance
sped
like
fire
through
the
parched
minds
of
the
other
members
in
their
eagerness
to
gain
the
least
little
clue
to
xingu
they
almost
forgot
the
joy
of
assisting
at
the
discomfiture
of
dane
the
latter
reddened
nervously
under
her
antagonist
s
challenge
may
i
ask
she
faltered
out
to
which
of
my
books
you
refer
roby
did
not
falter
that
s
just
what
i
want
you
to
tell
us
because
though
i
was
present
i
didn
t
actually
take
present
at
what
dane
took
her
up
and
for
an
instant
the
trembling
members
of
the
lunch
club
thought
that
the
champion
providence
had
raised
up
for
them
had
lost
a
point
but
roby
explained
herself
gaily
at
the
discussion
of
course
and
so
we
re
dreadfully
anxious
to
know
just
how
it
was
that
you
went
into
the
there
was
a
portentous
pause
a
silence
so
big
with
incalculable
dangers
that
the
members
with
one
accord
checked
the
words
on
their
lips
like
soldiers
dropping
their
arms
to
watch
a
single
combat
between
their
leaders
then
dane
gave
expression
to
their
inmost
dread
by
saying
sharply
ah
you
say
xingu
do
you
roby
smiled
undauntedly
it
is
a
shade
pedantic
isn
t
it
personally
i
always
drop
the
article
but
i
don
t
know
how
the
other
members
feel
about
the
other
members
looked
as
though
they
would
willingly
have
dispensed
with
this
appeal
to
their
opinion
and
roby
after
a
bright
glance
about
the
group
went
on
they
probably
think
as
i
do
that
nothing
really
matters
except
the
thing
itself
except
no
immediate
reply
seemed
to
occur
to
dane
and
ballinger
gathered
courage
to
say
surely
every
one
must
feel
that
about
plinth
came
to
her
support
with
a
heavy
murmur
of
assent
and
laura
glyde
sighed
out
emotionally
i
have
known
cases
where
it
has
changed
a
whole
it
has
done
me
worlds
of
good
leveret
interjected
seeming
to
herself
to
remember
that
she
had
either
taken
it
or
read
it
the
winter
before
of
course
roby
admitted
the
difficulty
is
that
one
must
give
up
so
much
time
to
it
it
s
very
i
can
t
imagine
said
miss
van
vluyck
grudging
the
time
given
to
such
a
and
deep
in
places
roby
pursued
so
then
it
was
a
book
and
it
isn
t
easy
to
i
never
skip
said
plinth
dogmatically
ah
it
s
dangerous
to
in
xingu
even
at
the
start
there
are
places
where
one
can
t
one
must
just
wade
i
should
hardly
call
it
said
ballinger
sarcastically
roby
sent
her
a
look
of
interest
ah
you
always
found
it
went
swimmingly
ballinger
hesitated
of
course
there
are
difficult
passages
she
conceded
yes
some
are
not
at
all
clear
even
roby
added
if
one
is
familiar
with
the
as
i
suppose
you
are
osric
dane
interposed
suddenly
fixing
her
with
a
look
of
challenge
roby
met
it
by
a
deprecating
gesture
oh
it
s
really
not
difficult
up
to
a
certain
point
though
some
of
the
branches
are
very
little
known
and
it
s
almost
impossible
to
get
at
the
have
you
ever
tried
plinth
enquired
still
distrustful
of
roby
s
thoroughness
roby
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
she
replied
with
lowered
lids
no
but
a
friend
of
mine
did
a
very
brilliant
man
and
he
told
me
it
was
best
for
women
not
to
a
shudder
ran
around
the
room
leveret
coughed
so
that
the
who
was
handing
the
cigarettes
should
not
hear
miss
van
vluyck
s
face
took
on
a
nauseated
expression
and
plinth
looked
as
if
she
were
passing
some
one
she
did
not
care
to
bow
to
but
the
most
remarkable
result
of
roby
s
words
was
the
effect
they
produced
on
the
lunch
club
s
distinguished
guest
osric
dane
s
impassive
features
suddenly
softened
to
an
expression
of
the
warmest
human
sympathy
and
edging
her
chair
toward
roby
s
she
asked
did
he
really
and
did
you
find
he
was
right
ballinger
in
whom
annoyance
at
roby
s
unwonted
assumption
of
prominence
was
beginning
to
displace
gratitude
for
the
aid
she
had
rendered
could
not
consent
to
her
being
allowed
by
such
dubious
means
to
monopolise
the
attention
of
their
guest
if
osric
dane
had
not
enough
to
resent
roby
s
flippancy
at
least
the
lunch
club
would
do
so
in
the
person
of
its
president
ballinger
laid
her
hand
on
roby
s
arm
we
must
not
forget
she
said
with
a
frigid
amiability
that
absorbing
as
xingu
is
to
it
may
be
less
interesting
to
oh
no
on
the
contrary
i
assure
you
osric
dane
intervened
to
others
ballinger
finished
firmly
and
we
must
not
allow
our
little
meeting
to
end
without
persuading
dane
to
say
a
few
words
to
us
on
a
subject
which
is
much
more
present
in
all
our
thoughts
i
refer
of
course
to
the
wings
of
the
other
members
animated
by
various
degrees
of
the
same
sentiment
and
encouraged
by
the
humanised
mien
of
their
redoubtable
guest
repeated
after
ballinger
oh
yes
you
really
talk
to
us
a
little
about
your
osric
dane
s
expression
became
as
bored
though
not
as
haughty
as
when
her
work
had
been
previously
mentioned
but
before
she
could
respond
to
ballinger
s
request
roby
had
risen
from
her
seat
and
was
pulling
down
her
veil
over
her
frivolous
nose
i
m
so
sorry
she
said
advancing
toward
her
hostess
with
outstretched
hand
but
before
dane
begins
i
think
i
d
better
run
away
unluckily
as
you
know
i
haven
t
read
her
books
so
i
should
be
at
a
terrible
disadvantage
among
you
all
and
besides
i
ve
an
engagement
to
play
if
roby
had
simply
pleaded
her
ignorance
of
osric
dane
s
works
as
a
reason
for
withdrawing
the
lunch
club
in
view
of
her
recent
prowess
might
have
approved
such
evidence
of
discretion
but
to
couple
this
excuse
with
the
brazen
announcement
that
she
was
foregoing
the
privilege
for
the
purpose
of
joining
a
was
only
one
more
instance
of
her
deplorable
lack
of
discrimination
the
ladies
were
disposed
however
to
feel
that
her
departure
now
that
she
had
performed
the
sole
service
she
was
ever
likely
to
render
them
would
probably
make
for
greater
order
and
dignity
in
the
impending
discussion
besides
relieving
them
of
the
sense
of
which
her
presence
always
mysteriously
produced
ballinger
therefore
restricted
herself
to
a
formal
murmur
of
regret
and
the
other
members
were
just
grouping
themselves
comfortably
about
osric
dane
when
the
latter
to
their
dismay
started
up
from
the
sofa
on
which
she
had
been
seated
oh
wait
do
wait
and
i
ll
go
with
you
she
called
out
to
roby
and
seizing
the
hands
of
the
disconcerted
members
she
administered
a
series
of
farewell
pressures
with
the
mechanical
haste
of
a
punching
tickets
i
m
so
sorry
i
d
quite
forgotten
she
flung
back
at
them
from
the
threshold
and
as
she
joined
roby
who
had
turned
in
surprise
at
her
appeal
the
other
ladies
had
the
mortification
of
hearing
her
say
in
a
voice
which
she
did
not
take
the
pains
to
lower
if
you
ll
let
me
walk
a
little
way
with
you
i
should
so
like
to
ask
you
a
few
more
questions
about
xingu
iii
the
incident
had
been
so
rapid
that
the
door
closed
on
the
departing
pair
before
the
other
members
had
time
to
understand
what
was
happening
then
a
sense
of
the
indignity
put
upon
them
by
osric
dane
s
unceremonious
desertion
began
to
contend
with
the
confused
feeling
that
they
had
been
cheated
out
of
their
due
without
exactly
knowing
how
or
why
there
was
a
silence
during
which
ballinger
with
a
perfunctory
hand
rearranged
the
skilfully
grouped
literature
at
which
her
distinguished
guest
had
not
so
much
as
glanced
then
miss
van
vluyck
tartly
pronounced
well
i
can
t
say
that
i
consider
osric
dane
s
departure
a
great
this
confession
crystallised
the
resentment
of
the
other
members
and
leveret
exclaimed
i
do
believe
she
came
on
purpose
to
be
nasty
it
was
plinth
s
private
opinion
that
osric
dane
s
attitude
toward
the
lunch
club
might
have
been
very
different
had
it
welcomed
her
in
the
majestic
setting
of
the
plinth
but
not
liking
to
reflect
on
the
inadequacy
of
ballinger
s
establishment
she
sought
a
roundabout
satisfaction
in
depreciating
her
lack
of
foresight
i
said
from
the
first
that
we
ought
to
have
had
a
subject
ready
it
s
what
always
happens
when
you
re
unprepared
now
if
we
d
only
got
up
xingu
the
slowness
of
plinth
s
mental
processes
was
always
allowed
for
by
the
club
but
this
instance
of
it
was
too
much
for
ballinger
s
equanimity
xingu
she
scoffed
why
it
was
the
fact
of
our
knowing
so
much
more
about
it
than
she
did
unprepared
though
we
were
that
made
osric
dane
so
furious
i
should
have
thought
that
was
plain
enough
to
everybody
this
retort
impressed
even
plinth
and
laura
glyde
moved
by
an
impulse
of
generosity
said
yes
we
really
ought
to
be
grateful
to
roby
for
introducing
the
topic
it
may
have
made
osric
dane
furious
but
at
least
it
made
her
i
am
glad
we
were
able
to
show
her
added
miss
van
vluyck
that
a
broad
and
culture
is
not
confined
to
the
great
intellectual
this
increased
the
satisfaction
of
the
other
members
and
they
began
to
forget
their
wrath
against
osric
dane
in
the
pleasure
of
having
contributed
to
her
discomfiture
miss
van
vluyck
thoughtfully
rubbed
her
spectacles
what
surprised
me
most
she
continued
was
that
fanny
roby
should
be
so
up
on
this
remark
threw
a
slight
chill
on
the
company
but
ballinger
said
with
an
air
of
indulgent
irony
mrs
roby
always
has
the
knack
of
making
a
little
go
a
long
way
still
we
certainly
owe
her
a
debt
for
happening
to
remember
that
she
d
heard
of
and
this
was
felt
by
the
other
members
to
be
a
graceful
way
of
cancelling
once
for
all
the
club
s
obligation
to
roby
even
leveret
took
courage
to
speed
a
timid
shaft
of
irony
i
fancy
osric
dane
hardly
expected
to
take
a
lesson
in
xingu
at
hillbridge
ballinger
smiled
when
she
asked
me
what
we
represented
do
you
remember
i
wish
i
d
simply
said
we
represented
xingu
all
the
ladies
laughed
appreciatively
at
this
sally
except
plinth
who
said
after
a
moment
s
deliberation
i
m
not
sure
it
would
have
been
wise
to
do
ballinger
who
was
already
beginning
to
feel
as
if
she
had
launched
at
osric
dane
the
retort
which
had
just
occurred
to
her
turned
ironically
on
plinth
may
i
ask
why
she
enquired
plinth
looked
grave
surely
she
said
i
understood
from
roby
herself
that
the
subject
was
one
it
was
as
well
not
to
go
into
too
deeply
miss
van
vluyck
rejoined
with
precision
i
think
that
applied
only
to
an
investigation
of
the
origin
of
the
of
the
and
suddenly
she
found
that
her
usually
accurate
memory
had
failed
her
it
s
a
part
of
the
subject
i
never
studied
she
concluded
nor
i
said
ballinger
laura
glyde
bent
toward
them
with
widened
eyes
and
yet
it
seems
doesn
t
it
the
part
that
is
fullest
of
an
esoteric
fascination
i
don
t
know
on
what
you
base
that
said
miss
van
vluyck
argumentatively
well
didn
t
you
notice
how
intensely
interested
osric
dane
became
as
soon
as
she
heard
what
the
brilliant
foreigner
he
a
foreigner
wasn
t
he
had
told
roby
about
the
origin
the
origin
of
the
rite
or
whatever
you
call
it
plinth
looked
disapproving
and
ballinger
visibly
wavered
then
she
said
it
may
not
be
desirable
to
touch
on
the
on
that
part
of
the
subject
in
general
conversation
but
from
the
importance
it
evidently
has
to
a
woman
of
osric
dane
s
distinction
i
feel
as
if
we
ought
not
to
be
afraid
to
discuss
it
among
ourselves
without
gloves
though
with
closed
doors
if
i
m
quite
of
your
opinion
miss
van
vluyck
came
briskly
to
her
support
on
condition
that
is
that
all
grossness
of
language
is
oh
i
m
sure
we
shall
understand
without
that
leveret
tittered
and
laura
glyde
added
significantly
i
fancy
we
can
read
between
the
lines
while
ballinger
rose
to
assure
herself
that
the
doors
were
really
closed
plinth
had
not
yet
given
her
adhesion
i
hardly
see
she
began
what
benefit
is
to
be
derived
from
investigating
such
peculiar
customs
but
ballinger
s
patience
had
reached
the
extreme
limit
of
tension
this
at
least
she
returned
that
we
shall
not
be
placed
again
in
the
humiliating
position
of
finding
ourselves
less
up
on
our
own
subjects
than
fanny
roby
even
to
plinth
this
argument
was
conclusive
she
peered
furtively
about
the
room
and
lowered
her
commanding
tones
to
ask
have
you
got
a
copy
a
a
copy
stammered
ballinger
she
was
aware
that
the
other
members
were
looking
at
her
expectantly
and
that
this
answer
was
inadequate
so
she
supported
it
by
asking
another
question
a
copy
of
what
her
companions
bent
their
expectant
gaze
on
plinth
who
in
turn
appeared
less
sure
of
herself
than
usual
why
of
of
the
book
she
explained
what
book
snapped
miss
van
vluyck
almost
as
sharply
as
osric
dane
ballinger
looked
at
laura
glyde
whose
eyes
were
interrogatively
fixed
on
leveret
the
fact
of
being
deferred
to
was
so
new
to
the
latter
that
it
filled
her
with
an
insane
temerity
why
xingu
of
course
she
exclaimed
a
profound
silence
followed
this
challenge
to
the
resources
of
ballinger
s
library
and
the
latter
after
glancing
nervously
toward
the
books
of
the
day
returned
with
dignity
it
s
not
a
thing
one
cares
to
leave
i
should
think
not
exclaimed
plinth
it
a
book
then
said
miss
van
vluyck
this
again
threw
the
company
into
disarray
and
ballinger
with
an
impatient
sigh
rejoined
why
there
a
book
naturally
then
why
did
miss
glyde
call
it
a
religion
laura
glyde
started
up
a
religion
i
never
yes
you
did
miss
van
vluyck
insisted
you
spoke
of
rites
and
plinth
said
it
was
a
miss
glyde
was
evidently
making
a
desperate
effort
to
recall
her
statement
but
accuracy
of
detail
was
not
her
strongest
point
at
length
she
began
in
a
deep
murmur
surely
they
used
to
do
something
of
the
kind
at
the
eleusinian
mysteries
oh
said
miss
van
vluyck
on
the
verge
of
disapproval
and
plinth
protested
i
understood
there
was
to
be
no
indelicacy
ballinger
could
not
control
her
irritation
really
it
is
too
bad
that
we
should
not
be
able
to
talk
the
matter
over
quietly
among
ourselves
personally
i
think
that
if
one
goes
into
xingu
at
all
oh
so
do
i
cried
miss
glyde
and
i
don
t
see
how
one
can
avoid
doing
so
if
one
wishes
to
keep
up
with
the
thought
of
the
day
leveret
uttered
an
exclamation
of
relief
there
that
s
it
she
interposed
what
s
it
the
president
took
her
up
why
it
s
a
a
thought
i
mean
a
this
seemed
to
bring
a
certain
relief
to
ballinger
and
laura
glyde
but
miss
van
vluyck
said
excuse
me
if
i
tell
you
that
you
re
all
mistaken
xingu
happens
to
be
a
a
language
the
lunch
club
cried
certainly
don
t
you
remember
fanny
roby
s
saying
that
there
were
several
branches
and
that
some
were
hard
to
trace
what
could
that
apply
to
but
dialects
ballinger
could
no
longer
restrain
a
contemptuous
laugh
really
if
the
lunch
club
has
reached
such
a
pass
that
it
has
to
go
to
fanny
roby
for
instruction
on
a
subject
like
xingu
it
had
almost
better
cease
to
exist
it
s
really
her
fault
for
not
being
clearer
laura
glyde
put
in
oh
clearness
and
fanny
roby
ballinger
shrugged
i
daresay
we
shall
find
she
was
mistaken
on
almost
every
why
not
look
it
up
said
plinth
as
a
rule
this
recurrent
suggestion
of
plinth
s
was
ignored
in
the
heat
of
discussion
and
only
resorted
to
afterward
in
the
privacy
of
each
member
s
home
but
on
the
present
occasion
the
desire
to
ascribe
their
own
confusion
of
thought
to
the
vague
and
contradictory
nature
of
roby
s
statements
caused
the
members
of
the
lunch
club
to
utter
a
collective
demand
for
a
book
of
reference
at
this
point
the
production
of
her
treasured
volume
gave
leveret
for
a
moment
the
unusual
experience
of
occupying
the
centre
front
but
she
was
not
able
to
hold
it
long
for
appropriate
allusions
contained
no
mention
of
xingu
oh
that
s
not
the
kind
of
thing
we
want
exclaimed
miss
van
vluyck
she
cast
a
disparaging
glance
over
ballinger
s
assortment
of
literature
and
added
impatiently
haven
t
you
any
useful
books
of
course
i
have
replied
ballinger
indignantly
i
keep
them
in
my
husband
s
from
this
region
after
some
difficulty
and
delay
the
produced
the
volume
of
an
encyclopaedia
and
in
deference
to
the
fact
that
the
demand
for
it
had
come
from
miss
van
vluyck
laid
the
ponderous
tome
before
her
there
was
a
moment
of
painful
suspense
while
miss
van
vluyck
rubbed
her
spectacles
adjusted
them
and
turned
to
z
and
a
murmur
of
surprise
when
she
said
it
isn
t
i
suppose
said
plinth
it
s
not
fit
to
be
put
in
a
book
of
oh
nonsense
exclaimed
ballinger
try
miss
van
vluyck
turned
back
through
the
volume
peering
up
and
down
the
pages
till
she
came
to
a
stop
and
remained
motionless
like
a
dog
on
a
point
well
have
you
found
it
ballinger
enquired
after
a
considerable
delay
yes
i
ve
found
it
said
miss
van
vluyck
in
a
queer
voice
plinth
hastily
interposed
i
beg
you
won
t
read
it
aloud
if
there
s
anything
miss
van
vluyck
without
answering
continued
her
silent
scrutiny
well
what
it
exclaimed
laura
glyde
excitedly
tell
us
urged
leveret
feeling
that
she
would
have
something
awful
to
tell
her
sister
miss
van
vluyck
pushed
the
volume
aside
and
turned
slowly
toward
the
expectant
group
it
s
a
a
yes
in
brazil
isn
t
that
where
she
s
been
living
who
fanny
roby
oh
but
you
must
be
mistaken
you
ve
been
reading
the
wrong
thing
ballinger
exclaimed
leaning
over
her
to
seize
the
volume
it
s
the
only
xingu
in
the
encyclopaedia
and
she
been
living
in
brazil
miss
van
vluyck
persisted
yes
her
brother
has
a
consulship
there
leveret
interposed
but
it
s
too
ridiculous
i
we
why
we
remember
studying
xingu
last
year
or
the
year
before
last
ballinger
stammered
i
thought
i
did
when
said
so
laura
glyde
avowed
i
said
so
cried
ballinger
yes
you
said
it
had
crowded
everything
else
out
of
your
well
said
it
had
changed
your
whole
life
for
that
matter
miss
van
vluyck
said
she
had
never
grudged
the
time
she
d
given
plinth
interposed
i
made
it
clear
that
i
knew
nothing
whatever
of
the
ballinger
broke
off
the
dispute
with
a
groan
oh
what
does
it
all
matter
if
she
s
been
making
fools
of
us
i
believe
miss
van
vluyck
s
right
she
was
talking
of
the
river
all
the
while
how
could
she
it
s
too
preposterous
miss
glyde
exclaimed
miss
van
vluyck
had
repossessed
herself
of
the
encyclopaedia
and
restored
her
spectacles
to
a
nose
reddened
by
excitement
the
xingu
one
of
the
principal
rivers
of
brazil
rises
on
the
plateau
of
mato
grosso
and
flows
in
a
northerly
direction
for
a
length
of
no
less
than
one
thousand
one
hundred
and
eighteen
miles
entering
the
amazon
near
the
mouth
of
the
latter
river
the
upper
course
of
the
xingu
is
auriferous
and
fed
by
numerous
branches
its
source
was
first
discovered
in
by
the
german
explorer
von
den
steinen
after
a
difficult
and
dangerous
expedition
through
a
region
inhabited
by
tribes
still
in
the
stone
age
of
the
ladies
received
this
communication
in
a
state
of
stupefied
silence
from
which
leveret
was
the
first
to
rally
she
certainly
speak
of
its
having
the
word
seemed
to
snap
the
last
thread
of
their
incredulity
and
of
its
great
length
gasped
ballinger
she
said
it
was
awfully
deep
and
you
couldn
t
skip
you
just
had
to
wade
through
miss
glyde
added
the
idea
worked
its
way
more
slowly
through
plinth
s
compact
resistances
how
could
there
be
anything
improper
about
a
river
she
enquired
improper
why
what
she
said
about
the
source
that
it
was
corrupt
not
corrupt
but
hard
to
get
at
laura
glyde
corrected
some
one
who
d
been
there
had
told
her
so
i
daresay
it
was
the
explorer
himself
doesn
t
it
say
the
expedition
was
dangerous
difficult
and
dangerous
read
miss
van
vluyck
ballinger
pressed
her
hands
to
her
throbbing
temples
there
s
nothing
she
said
that
wouldn
t
apply
to
a
river
to
this
river
she
swung
about
excitedly
to
the
other
members
why
do
you
remember
her
telling
us
that
she
hadn
t
read
the
supreme
instant
because
she
d
taken
it
on
a
boating
party
while
she
was
staying
with
her
brother
and
some
one
had
shied
it
overboard
shied
of
course
was
her
own
the
ladies
breathlessly
signified
that
the
expression
had
not
escaped
them
well
and
then
didn
t
she
tell
osric
dane
that
one
of
her
books
was
simply
saturated
with
xingu
of
course
it
was
if
one
of
roby
s
rowdy
friends
had
thrown
it
into
the
river
this
surprising
reconstruction
of
the
scene
in
which
they
had
just
participated
left
the
members
of
the
lunch
club
inarticulate
at
length
plinth
after
visibly
labouring
with
the
problem
said
in
a
heavy
tone
osric
dane
was
taken
in
leveret
took
courage
at
this
perhaps
that
s
what
roby
did
it
for
she
said
osric
dane
was
a
brute
and
she
may
have
wanted
to
give
her
a
miss
van
vluyck
frowned
it
was
hardly
worth
while
to
do
it
at
our
at
least
said
miss
glyde
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
she
succeeded
in
interesting
her
which
was
more
than
we
what
chance
had
we
rejoined
ballinger
mrs
roby
monopolised
her
from
the
first
and
i
ve
no
doubt
was
her
purpose
to
give
osric
dane
a
false
impression
of
her
own
standing
in
the
club
she
would
hesitate
at
nothing
to
attract
attention
we
all
know
how
she
took
in
poor
professor
she
actually
makes
him
give
every
thursday
leveret
piped
up
laura
glyde
struck
her
hands
together
why
this
is
thursday
and
it
s
she
s
gone
of
course
and
taken
osric
with
her
and
they
re
shrieking
over
us
at
this
moment
said
ballinger
between
her
teeth
this
possibility
seemed
too
preposterous
to
be
admitted
she
would
hardly
dare
said
miss
van
vluyck
confess
the
imposture
to
osric
i
m
not
so
sure
i
thought
i
saw
her
make
a
sign
as
she
left
if
she
hadn
t
made
a
sign
why
should
osric
dane
have
rushed
out
after
her
well
you
know
we
d
all
been
telling
her
how
wonderful
xingu
was
and
she
said
she
wanted
to
find
out
more
about
it
leveret
said
with
a
tardy
impulse
of
justice
to
the
absent
this
reminder
far
from
mitigating
the
wrath
of
the
other
members
gave
it
a
stronger
impetus
yes
and
that
s
exactly
what
they
re
both
laughing
over
now
said
laura
glyde
ironically
plinth
stood
up
and
gathered
her
expensive
furs
about
her
monumental
form
i
have
no
wish
to
criticise
she
said
but
unless
the
lunch
club
can
protect
its
members
against
the
recurrence
of
such
such
unbecoming
scenes
i
for
one
oh
so
do
i
agreed
miss
glyde
rising
also
miss
van
vluyck
closed
the
encyclopaedia
and
proceeded
to
button
herself
into
her
jacket
my
time
is
really
too
valuable
she
began
i
fancy
we
are
all
of
one
mind
said
ballinger
looking
searchingly
at
leveret
who
looked
at
the
others
i
always
deprecate
anything
like
a
scandal
plinth
continued
she
has
been
the
cause
of
one
exclaimed
miss
glyde
leveret
moaned
i
don
t
see
how
she
and
miss
van
vluyck
said
picking
up
her
some
women
stop
at
but
if
plinth
took
up
her
argument
impressively
anything
of
the
kind
had
happened
in
house
it
never
would
have
her
tone
implied
i
should
have
felt
that
i
owed
it
to
myself
either
to
ask
for
roby
s
resignation
or
to
offer
oh
plinth
gasped
the
lunch
club
fortunately
for
me
plinth
continued
with
an
awful
magnanimity
the
matter
was
taken
out
of
my
hands
by
our
president
s
decision
that
the
right
to
entertain
distinguished
guests
was
a
privilege
vested
in
her
office
and
i
think
the
other
members
will
agree
that
as
she
was
alone
in
this
opinion
she
ought
to
be
alone
in
deciding
on
the
best
way
of
effacing
its
its
really
deplorable
a
deep
silence
followed
this
outbreak
of
plinth
s
resentment
i
don
t
see
why
i
should
be
expected
to
ask
her
to
resign
ballinger
at
length
began
but
laura
glyde
turned
back
to
remind
her
you
know
she
made
you
say
that
you
d
got
on
swimmingly
in
an
giggle
escaped
from
leveret
and
ballinger
energetically
continued
but
you
needn
t
think
for
a
moment
that
i
m
afraid
to
the
door
of
the
closed
on
the
retreating
backs
of
the
lunch
club
and
the
president
of
that
distinguished
association
seating
herself
at
her
and
pushing
away
a
copy
of
the
wings
of
death
to
make
room
for
her
elbow
drew
forth
a
sheet
of
the
club
s
on
which
she
began
to
write
my
dear
roby
