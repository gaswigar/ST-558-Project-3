nature
has
the
habit
of
now
and

producing
a
type
of
human
being
far
in
advance
of

times
an
ideal
for
us
to
emulate
a
being
devoid
of
sham
uncompromising
and
to
whom
the
truth
is
sacred
a
being
whose
selfishness
is
so
large
that
it
takes
in
the
whole
human
race
and
treats
self
only
as
one
of
the
great
mass
a
being
keen
to
sense
all
forms
of
wrong
and
powerful
in
denunciation
of
it
one
who
can
reach
into
the
future
and

such
a
being
was
de
what

added

splendid
tribute
by
jay
fox
to
the
memory
of
de
these
admirable
words

sentiments
of
all
the
friends
and
comrades
of
that
remarkable
woman

whole
life
was
dedicated
to
a
dominant
idea
like
many
other
women
in
public
life
de
was
a
voluminous
letter
writer
those
letters
addressed
to
her
comrades
friends
and
admirers
would
form
her
real
biography
in
them
we
trace
her
heroic
struggles
her
activity
her
beliefs
her
doubts
her
mental
changes
in
short
her
whole
life
mirrored
in
a
manner
no
biographer
will
ever
be
able
to
equal
to
collect
and
publish
this
correspondence
as
a
part
of
de
works
is
impossible
the
task
is
too
big
for
the
present
undertaking
but
let
us
hope
that
we
will
find
time
and
means
to
publish
at
least
a
part
of
this
correspondence
in
the
near
future
the
average
american
still
holds
to
the
belief
that
anarchism
is
a
foreign
poison
imported
into
the
states
from
decadent
europe
by
criminal
paranoiacs
hence
the
ridiculous
attempt
of
our
lawmakers
to
stamp
out
anarchy
by
passing
a
statute
which
forbids
anarchists
from
other
lands
to
enter
the
country
those
wise
solons
are
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
anarchist
theories
and
ideas
were
propounded
in
our
commonwealth
ere
proudhon
or
bakunin
entered
the
arena
of
intellectual
struggle
and
formulated
their
thesis
of
perfect
freedom
and
economic
independence
in
anarchy
neither
are
they
acquainted
with
the
writings
of
lysander
spooner
josiah
warren
stephen
pearl
andrews
william
greene
or
benjamin
tucker
nor
familiar
with
the
propagandistic
work
of
albert
parsons
dyer
lum
james
moses
harman
ross
winn
and
a
host
of
other
anarchists
who
sprang
from
the
native
stock
and
soil
to
call
their
attention
to
these
facts
is
quite
as
futile
as
to
point
out
that
the
tocsin
of
revolt
resounds
in
the
writings
of
emerson
thoreau
hawthorne
whitman
garrison
wendell
phillips
and
other
seers
of
america
just
as
futile
as
to
prove
to
them
that
the
pioneers
in
the
movement
for
woman
emancipation
in
america
were
permeated
with
anarchist
thoughts
and
feelings
hardened
by
a
fierce
struggle
and
strengthened
by
a
vicious
persecution
those
brave
champions
of
defied
the
respectable
mob
by
proclaiming
their
independence
from
prevailing
cant
and
hypocrisy
they
inaugurated
the
tremendous
sex
revolt
among
the
american
women
a
purely
native
movement
which
has
yet
to
find
its
historian
de
belongs
to
this
gallant
array
of
rebels
who
swore
allegiance
to
the
cause
of
universal
liberty
thus
forfeiting
the
respect
of
all
honorable
citizens
and
bringing
upon
their
heads
the
persecution
of
the
ruling
class
in
the
real
history
of
the
struggle
for
human
emancipation
her
name
will
be
found
among
the
foremost
of
her
time
born
shortly
after
the
close
of
the
civil
war
she
witnessed
during
her
life
the
most
momentous
transformation
of
the
nation
she
saw
the
change
from
an
agricultural
community
into
an
industrial
empire
the
tremendous
development
of
capital
in
this
country
with
the
accompanying
misery
and
degradation
of
labor
her
life
path
was
sketched
ere
she
reached
the
age
of
womanhood
she
had
to
become
a
rebel
to
stand
outside
of
the
struggle
would
have
meant
intellectual
death
she
chose
the
only
way
de
was
born
on
november
in
the
town
of
leslie
michigan
she
died
on
june
in
chicago
she
came
from
stock
on
her
mother
side
of
puritan
descent
her
father
auguste
de
cleyre
was
a
native
of
western
flanders
but
his
family
was
of
french
origin
he
emigrated
to
america
in
being
a
freethinker
and
a
great
admirer
of
voltaire
he
insisted
on
the
birthday
of
the
child
that
the
new
member
of
the
family
should
be
called
voltairine
though
born
in
leslie
the
earliest
recollections
of
voltairine
were
of
the
small
town
of
john
in
clinton
county
her
parents
having
removed
to
that
place
a
year
after
her
birth
voltairine
did
not
have
a
happy
childhood
her
earliest
life
was
embittered
by
want
of
the
common
necessities
which
her
parents
hard
as
they
tried
could
not
provide
a
vein
of
sadness
can
be
traced
in
her
earliest
poems
the
songs
of
a
child
of
talent
and
great
fantasy
a
deep
sorrow
fell
into
her
heart
at
the
age
of
four
when
the
teacher
of
the
primary
school
refused
to
admit
her
because
she
was
too
young
but
she
soon
succeeded
in
forcing
her
entrance
into
the
temple
of
knowledge
an
earnest
student
she
was
graduated
from
the
grammar
school
at
the
age
of
twelve
strength
of
mind
does
not
seem
to
have
been
a
characteristic
of
auguste
de
cleyre
for
he
recanted
his
libertarian
ideas
returned
to
the
fold
of
the
church
and
became
obsessed
with
the
idea
that
the
highest
vocation
for
a
woman
was
the
life
of
a
nun
he
determined
to
put
the
child
into
a
convent
thus
began
the
great
tragedy
of
her
beloved
mother
a
member
of
the
presbyterian
church
opposed
this
idea
with
all
her
strength
but
in
vain
the
will
of
the
lord
of
the
household
prevailed
and
the
child
was
sent
to
the
convent
of
our
lady
of
lake
huron
at
sarnia
in
the
province
of
ontario
canada
here
she
experienced
four
years
of
terrible
ordeal
only
after
much
repression
insubordination
and
atonement
she
forced
her
way
back
into
the
living
world
in
the
sketch
the
making
of
an
anarchist
she
tells
us
of
the
strain
she
underwent
in
that
living
tomb
how
i
pity
myself
now
when
i
remember
it
poor
lonesome
little
soul
battling
solitary
in
the
murk
of
religious
superstition
unable
to
believe
and
yet
in
hourly
fear
of
damnation
hot
savage
and
eternal
if
i
do
not
instantly
confess
and
profess
how
well
i
recall
the
bitter
energy
with
which
i
repelled
my
teacher
enjoinder
when
i
told
her
i
did
not
wish
to
apologize
for
an
adjudged
fault
as
i
could
not
see
that
i
had
been
wrong
and
would
not
feel
my
words
is
not
necessary
said
she
we
should
feel
what
we
say
but
it
is
always
necessary
that
we
obey
our
superiors
will
not
lie
i
answered
hotly
and
at
the
same
time
trembled
lest
my
disobedience
had
finally
consigned
me
to
torment
i
struggled
my
way
out
at
last
and
was
a
freethinker
when
i
left
the
institution
three
years
later
though
i
had
never
seen
a
book
or
heard
a
word
to
help
me
in
my
loneliness
it
had
been
like
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
and
there
are
white
scars
on
my
soul
yet
where
ignorance
and
superstition
burnt
me
with
their
in
those
stifling
days
am
i
blasphemous
it
is
their
word
not
mine
beside
that
battle
of
my
young
days
all
others
have
been
easy
for
whatever
was
without
within
my
own
will
was
supreme
it
has
owed
no
allegiance
and
never
shall
it
has
moved
steadily
in
one
direction
the
knowledge
and
assertion
of
its
own
liberty
with
all
the
responsibility
falling
thereon
during
her
stay
at
the
convent
there
was
little
communication
between
her
and
her
parents
in
a
letter
from
eliza
de
cleyre
the
mother
of
we
are
informed
that
she
decided
to
run
away
from
the
convent
after
she
had
been
there
a
few
weeks
she
escaped
before
breakfast
and
crossed
the
river
to
port
huron
but
as
she
had
no
money
she
started
to
walk
home
after
covering
seventeen
miles
she
realized
that
she
never
could
do
it
so
she
turned
around
and
walked
back
and
entering
the
house
of
an
acquaintance
in
port
huron
asked
for
something
to
eat
they
sent
for
her
father
who
afterwards
took
her
back
to
the
convent
what
penance
they
inflicted
she
never
told
but
at
sixteen
her
health
was
so
bad
that
the
convent
authorities
let
her
come
home
for
a
vacation
telling
her
however
that
she
would
find
her
every
movement
watched
and
that
everything
she
said
would
be
reported
to
them
the
result
was
that
she
started
at
every
sound
her
hands
shaking
and
her
face
as
pale
as
death
she
was
about
five
weeks
from
graduating
at
that
time
when
her
vacation
was
over
she
went
back
and
finished
her
studies
and
then
she
started
for
home
again
but
this
time
she
had
money
enough
for
her
fare
and
she
got
home
to
stay
never
to
go
back
to
the
place
that
had
been
a
prison
to
her
she
had
seen
enough
of
the
convent
to
decide
for
herself
that
she
could
not
be
a
nun
the
child
who
had
sung
there
a
love
supreme
in
the
great
hereafter
the
buds
of
earth
are
bloom
in
heaven
the
smiles
of
the
world
are
ripples
of
laughter
when
back
to
its
aidenn
the
soul
is
given
and
the
tears
of
the
world
though
long
in
flowing
water
the
fields
of
the
they
fall
as
dews
on
the
sweet
grass
growing
when
the
fountains
of
sorrow
and
grief
run
dry
though
clouds
hang
over
the
furrows
now
sowing
there
a
harvest
in
the
no
love
is
wasted
no
heart
beats
vainly
there
a
vast
perfection
beyond
the
grave
up
the
bays
of
heaven
the
stars
shine
plainly
the
stars
lying
dim
on
the
brow
of
the
wave
and
the
lights
of
our
loves
though
they
flicker
and
wane
they
shall
shine
all
undimmed
in
the
ether
nave
for
the
altars
of
god
are
lit
with
souls
fanned
to
flaming
with
love
where
the
rolls
returned
from
the
convent
a
freethinker
she
was
received
with
open
arms
by
her
mother
almost
as
one
returned
from
the
grave
with
the
exception
of
the
education
derived
from
books
she
knew
no
more
than
a
child
having
almost
no
knowledge
of
practical
things
already
in
the
convent
she
had
succeeded
in
impressing
her
strong
personality
upon
her
surroundings
her
teachers
could
not
break
her
they
were
therefore
forced
to
respect
her
in
a
polemic
with
the
editor
of
the
catholic
and
a
few
years
ago
wrote
if
you
think
that
i
as
your
opponent
deserve
the
benefit
of
truth
but
as
a
stranger
you
doubt
my
veracity
i
respectfully
request
you
to
submit
this
letter
to
sister
mary
medard
my
former
teacher
now
superioress
at
windsor
or
to
my
revered
friend
father
siegfried
overbrook
seminary
overbrook
who
will
tell
you
whether
in
their
opinion
my
disposition
to
tell
the
truth
may
be
trusted
reaction
from
the
repression
and
the
cruel
discipline
of
the
catholic
church
helped
to
develop
inherent
tendency
toward
the
murder
of
the
labor
leaders
in
chicago
in
shocked
her
mind
so
deeply
that
from
that
moment
dates
her
development
toward
anarchism
when
in
the
bomb
fell
on
the
haymarket
square
and
the
anarchists
were
arrested
de
who
at
that
time
was
a
lecturer
shouted
they
ought
to
be
hanged
they
were
hanged
and
now
her
body
rests
in
waldheim
cemetery
near
the
grave
of
those
martyrs
speaking
at
a
memorial
meeting
in
honor
of
those
comrades
in
she
said
for
that
ignorant
outrageous
bloodthirsty
sentence
i
shall
never
forgive
myself
though
i
know
the
dead
men
would
have
forgiven
me
though
i
know
those
who
loved
them
forgive
me
but
my
own
voice
as
it
sounded
that
night
will
sound
so
in
my
ears
till
i
die
a
bitter
reproach
and
a
shame
i
have
only
one
word
of
extenuation
for
myself
and
the
millions
of
others
who
did
as
i
did
that
night
ignorance
she
did
not
remain
long
in
ignorance
in
the
making
of
an
anarchist
she
describes
why
she
became
a
convert
to
the
idea
and
why
she
entered
the
movement
till
then
she
writes
i
believed
in
the
essential
justice
of
the
american
law
and
trial
by
jury
after
that
i
never
could
the
infamy
of
that
trial
has
passed
into
history
and
the
question
it
awakened
as
to
the
possibility
of
justice
under
law
has
passed
into
clamorous
crying
across
the
world
at
the
age
of
nineteen
had
consecrated
herself
to
the
service
of
humanity
in
her
poem
the
burial
of
my
past
self
she
thus
bids
farewell
to
her
youthful
life
and
now
humanity
i
turn
to
you
i
consecrate
my
service
to
the
world
perish
the
old
love
welcome
to
the
new
broad
as
the
where
the
stars
are
whirled
yet
the
pure
and
simple
agitation
in
its
narrow
circle
could
not
suffice
her
the
spirit
of
rebellion
the
spirit
of
anarchy
took
hold
of
her
soul
the
idea
of
universal
rebellion
saved
her
otherwise
she
might
have
stagnated
like
so
many
of
her
contemporaries
suffocated
in
the
narrow
surroundings
of
their
intellectual
life
a
lecture
of
clarence
darrow
which
she
heard
in
led
her
to
the
study
of
socialism
and
then
there
was
for
her
but
one
step
to
anarchism
dyer
lum
the
fellow
worker
of
the
chicago
martyrs
had
undoubtedly
the
greatest
influence
in
shaping
her
development
he
was
her
teacher
her
confidant
and
comrade
his
death
in
was
a
terrible
blow
to
spent
the
greater
part
of
her
life
in
philadelphia
here
among
congenial
friends
and
later
among
the
jewish
emigrants
she
did
her
best
work
in
she
went
on
a
lecture
tour
to
england
and
scotland
and
in
after
an
insane
youth
had
tried
to
take
her
life
she
went
for
a
short
trip
to
norway
to
recuperate
from
her
wounds
hers
was
a
life
of
bitter
economic
struggle
and
an
unceasing
fight
with
physical
weakness
partly
resulting
from
this
very
economic
struggle
one
wonders
how
under
such
circumstances
she
could
have
produced
such
an
amount
of
work
her
poems
sketches
propagandistic
articles
and

protest
but
as
she
used
to
quote
her
comrade
dyer
lum
events
proved
to
be
the
true
schoolmasters
the
last
years
of
her
life
were
filled
with
the
spirit
of
direct
action
and
especially
with
the
social
importance
of
the
mexican
revolution

splendid
propaganda
work
of
wm

in
behalf
of
this
tremendous
upheaval
inspired
her
to
great
effort
she
too
had
found
out
by
experience
that
only
action
counts
that
only
a
direct
participation
in
the
struggle

remarkable

was
a
born
iconoclast

spirit

too
free
her
taste
too
refined
to
accept
any
idea
that
has
the
slightest
degree
of
limitation
a
great
sadness
a
knowledge
that
there
is
a
universal
pain
filled
her
heart
through
her
own
suffering
and
through
the
suffering
of
others
she
reached
the
highest
exaltation
of
mind
she
was
conscious
of
all
the
vanities
of
life
in
the
service
of
the
poor
and
oppressed
she
found
her
life

exquisite
tribute

a
priestess
of
pity
and
of
vengeance
whose
voice
has
a
vibrant
quality
that
is
unique
in
literature
we
are
convinced
that
her
writings
will
live
as
long
as
humanity
exists
poems
the
burial
of
my
past
self
poor
heart
so
weary
with
thy
bitter
grief
so
thou
art
dead
at
last
silent
and
chill
the
came
to
thy
relief
and
there
thou
liest
heart
forever
still
dead
eyes
beneath
their
pall
dead
cheeks
with
so
many
tears
so
thou
art
passed
far
far
beyond
recall
and
all
thy
hopes
are
past
and
all
thy
fears
thy
lips
are
closed
at
length
in
the
long
peace
pale
lips
so
long
they
have
thy
woe
repressed
they
seem
even
now
when
life
has
run
its
lease
all
dumbly
pitiful
in
their
mournful
rest
and
now
i
lay
thee
in
thy
silent
tomb
printing
thy
brow
with
one
last
solemn
kiss
laying
upon
thee
one
fair
lily
bloom
a
symbol
of
thy
rest
oh
rest
is
bliss
no
heart
i
would
not
call
thee
back
again
no
no
too
much
of
suffering
hast
thou
known
but
yet
but
yet
it
was
not
all
in
vain
thy
unseen
tears
thy
solitary
moan
for
out
of
sorrow
joy
comes
uppermost
where
breaks
the
thunder
soon
the
sky
smiles
blue
a
better
love
replaces
what
is
lost
and
phantom
sunlight
pales
before
the
true
the
seed
must
burst
before
the
germ
unfolds
the
stars
must
fade
before
the
morning
wakes
down
in
her
depths
the
mine
the
diamond
holds
a
new
heart
pulses
when
the
old
heart
breaks
and
now
humanity
i
turn
to
you
i
consecrate
my
service
to
the
world
perish
the
old
love
welcome
to
the
new
broad
as
the
where
the
stars
are
whirled
night
on
the
graves
the
sweet
quiet
homes
in
the
silent
softly
the
dewdrops
the
fall
broadly
about
like
the
wide
arms
of
pity
the
darkness
lies
over
all
heroes
asleep
the
with
honor
with
rest
gently
above
you
each
bough
breathes
a
whisper
sleep
well
ye
are
blest
oh
never
as
long
as
the
heart
pulses
quicker
at
the
dear
name
of
country
may
yours
be
forgot
nor
may
we
till
the
last
puny
life
spark
shall
flicker
your
deeds
from
the
tablets
of
memory
blot
spirits
afloat
in
the
that
bound
us
souls
of
the
and
of
the
keep
the
fair
light
of
liberty
shining
around
us
till
our
souls
may
go
back
to
the
mighty
johns
decoration
day
the
christian
faith
the
two
following
poems
were
written
at
that
period
of
my
life
when
the
questions
of
the
existence
of
god
and
the
divinity
of
jesus
had
but
recently
been
settled
and
they
present
the
pros
and
cons
which
had
been
repeating
themselves
over
and
over
again
in
my
brain
for
some
years
we
contrast
light
and
darkness
light
of
god
and
darkness
from
the
stygian
shades
of
hell
fumes
of
the
pit
infernal
rising
up
have
clouded
the
brain
laid
reason
low
for
when
the
eye
looks
on
fair
nature
face
and
sees
not
god
then
is
she
blind
indeed
no
night
so
starless
even
in
its
gloom
as
his
who
wanders
on
without
a
hope
in
that
great
just
hereafter
all
must
meet
no
heart
so
dull
so
heavy
and
so
void
as
that
which
lives
for
this
chill
world
alone
no
soul
so
groveling
unaspiring
base
as
that
which
here
forgets
the
afterhere
and
still
through
all
the
darkness
and
the
gloom
its
voice
will
not
be
stilled
its
hopes
be
quenched
it
cries
it
screams
it
struggles
in
its
chains
and
bleeds
upon
the
altar
of
the
mind
unwilling
sacrifice
to
thought
misled
the
soul
that
knows
no
god
can
know
no
peace
thus
speaketh
light
the
herald
of
our
god
in
that
far
dawn
where
shone
each
rolling
world
first
lit
with
shadowed
splendor
of
the
stars
in
that
fair
morning
when
creation
sang
its
praise
of
god
yet
it
dreamed
of
sin
pure
and
untainted
as
the
source
of
life
man
dwelt
in
eden
there
no
shadows
came
no
question
of
the
goodness
of
our
lord
until
the
prince
of
darkness
tempted
man
and
yielding
to
the
newly
born
desire
he
fell
sank
in
the
mire
of
ignorance
and
man
who
put
himself
in
satan
power
since
then
has
wandered
far
in
devious
ways
seeing
but
now
and
then
a
glimpse
of
light
till
christ
is
come
the
living
son
of
god
far
in
his
heavenly
home
he
viewed
the
world
saw
all
her
sadness
and
her
sufferings
saw
all
her
woes
her
struggles
and
her
search
for
some
path
leading
up
from
out
the
night
within
his
breast
the
fount
of
tears
was
touched
his
great
heart
swelled
with
pity
and
he
said
father
i
go
to
save
the
world
from
sin
ah
what
power
but
a
soul
divinely
clad
in
purity
in
holiness
and
love
could
leave
a
home
of
happiness
and
light
for
this
lost
world
of
suffering
and
death
he
came
the
world
tossed
groaning
in
her
sleep
he
touched
her
brow
the
nightmare
passed
away
he
soothed
her
heart
red
with
the
stain
of
sin
and
she
forgot
her
guilt
in
penitence
she
washed
the
ruby
out
with
pearls
of
tears
he
came
he
suffered
and
he
died
for
us
he
felt
the
bitterest
woes
a
soul
can
feel
he
probed
the
darkest
depths
of
human
grief
he
sounded
all
the
deeps
and
shoals
of
pain
was
cursed
for
all
his
love
thanked
with
the
cross
whereon
he
hung
nailed
bleeding
glorified
as
the
last
smoke
of
holocaust
divine
ah
this
was
all
two
thousand
years
ago
two
thousand
years
ago
and
still
he
cries
with
voice
sweet
calling
through
the
distant
dark
o
souls
that
labor
struggling
in
your
pain
come
unto
me
and
i
will
give
you
rest
for
every
woe
of
yours
and
every
smart
i
too
have
felt
the
mockery
the
shame
the
sneer
the
scoffing
lip
the
hate
the
lust
the
greed
of
gain
the
jealousy
of
man
unstinted
have
been
measured
out
to
me
i
know
them
all
i
feel
them
all
with
you
and
i
have
known
the
pangs
of
poverty
the
cry
of
hunger
and
the
weary
heart
of
childhood
burdened
with
the
weight
of
age
o
sufferers
ye
all
are
mine
to
love
the
of
my
heart
go
out
with
you
and
every
drop
of
agony
that
drips
from
my
nailed
hands
adown
this
bitter
cross
cries
out
god
accept
the
sacrifice
and
ope
the
gates
of
heaven
to
the
world
ye
vermin
of
the
garret
who
do
creep
your
weary
lives
away
within
its
walls
ye
children
of
the
cellar
who
behold
the
sweet
pale
light
strained
through
the
lothsome
air
and
doled
to
you
in
as
a
thing
too
precious
for
your
use
ye
rats
in
mines
who
knaw
within
the
black
and
somber
pits
to
seek
poor
living
for
your
little
ones
ye
women
who
stitch
out
your
lonely
lives
unmindful
whether
sun
or
stars
keep
watch
ye
slaves
of
wheels
ye
worms
that
bite
the
dust
where
pride
and
scorn
have
ground
you
the
heel
ye
toilers
of
the
earth
ye
weary
ones
i
know
your
sufferings
i
feel
your
woes
my
peace
i
give
you
in
a
little
while
the
pain
will
all
be
over
and
the
grave
will
sweetly
close
above
your
folded
hands
and
then
ah
death
no
conqueror
art
thou
for
i
have
loosed
thy
chains
i
have
unbarred
the
gates
of
heaven
in
my
father
house
of
many
mansions
i
prepare
a
place
and
rest
is
there
for
every
heart
that
toils
oh
all
ye
sick
and
wounded
ones
who
grieve
for
the
lost
health
that
may
come
again
ye
who
do
toss
upon
a
couch
of
pain
upon
whose
brow
disease
has
laid
his
hand
within
whose
eyes
the
dull
and
heavy
sight
burns
like
a
taper
burning
very
low
upon
whose
lips
the
purple
rests
his
hot
breath
and
dries
the
sickened
palms
scorches
the
flesh
and
the
very
air
ye
who
do
grope
along
without
the
light
ye
who
do
stumble
halting
on
your
way
ye
whom
the
world
despises
as
unclean
know
that
the
soul
has
none
of
these
the
unbound
spirit
goes
unto
its
god
pure
whole
and
beauteous
as
newly
born
oh
all
ye
mourners
weeping
for
the
dead
your
tears
i
gather
as
the
grateful
rain
which
rises
from
the
sea
and
falls
again
to
nurse
the
withering
flowers
from
its
touch
no
drop
is
ever
lost
they
fall
again
to
nurse
the
blossoms
of
some
other
heart
i
would
not
dry
one
single
dew
of
grief
the
lashes
which
bespeak
the
broken
heart
and
soul
are
dear
to
me
i
mourn
with
them
and
mourning
so
i
find
the
soul
with
weeping
oft
grows
light
but
yet
ye
mourn
for
them
not
without
hope
beyond
the
woes
and
sorrows
of
the
earth
as
stars
still
shine
though
clouds
obscure
the
sight
the
friends
ye
mourn
as
lost
immortal
live
and
ye
shall
meet
and
know
their
souls
again
through
death
transfigured
through
love
glorified
oh
all
ye
patient
waiters
for
reward
scorned
and
despised
by
those
who
know
not
worth
i
know
your
merit
and
i
give
you
hope
for

my
father

is
justice
found
see
how
the
toiling
underground
waits
patiently
for
time
to
burst
its
shell
and
by
and
by
the
golden
sunlight
warms
the
dark
cold
earth
the
germ
begins
to
shoot
and
upward
trends
until
two
small
green
leaves
unfold
and

pure
fresh
air
the
blossoms

with
summer
breath

johns
april
the
freethinker
plea
grand
eye
of
liberty
light
up
my
page
like
promised
morning
after
night
of
age
thy
dawning
youth
breaks
in
the
distant
east
thy
cloudy
robes
like
silken
curtains
creased
and
swung
in
folds
are
floating
fair
and
free
the
shadows
of
the
cycles
turn
and
flee
the
budding
stars
bright
minds
that
gemmed
the
night
are
bursting
into
broad
light
sweet
liberty
how
pure
thy
very
breath
how
dear
in
life
how
doubly
dear
in
death
ah
slaves
that
suffer
in
your
chains
praying
your
christ
to
touch
and
heal
your
pains
tear
off
your
shackling
irons
unbind
your
eyes
seize
the
grand
hopes
that
burn
along
the
skies
worship
not
god
in
temples
built
of
gloom
far
sweeter
incense
is
the
than
all
the
fires
that
sacrifice
may
light
and
grander
is
the
gleaming
bright
with
glowing
worlds
than
all
your
altar
lamps
pale
flickering
in
your
clammy
vaulted
damps
and
richer
is
the
broad
full
fair
sun
sheen
dripping
its
orient
light
in
streams
between
the
fretted
shafting
of
the
forest
trees
throwing
its
golden
kisses
to
the
breeze
lifting
the
grasses
with
its
and
pressing
the
young
blossoms
with
warm
lips
its
glory
over
plain
and
hill
wreathing
the
storm
and
dancing
in
the
rill
far
richer
in
wild
freedom
falling
there
shaking
the
tresses
of
its
yellow
hair
than
all
subdued
within
the
dim
of
stained
glass
windows
drooping
into
night
oh
grander
far
the
massive
mountain
walls
which
bound
the
vista
of
the
forest
halls
than
all
the
sculptured
forms
which
guard
the
piles
that
arch
your
tall
dim
gray
cathedral
aisles
and
gladder
is
the
carol
of
a
bird
than
all
the
anthems
that
were
ever
heard
to
steal
in
somber
chanting
from
the
tone
of
master
voices
praising
the
unknown
in
the
great
wild
where
foot
of
man
trod
there
find
we
nature
church
and
nature
god
here
are
no
fetters
though
is
free
as
air
its
flight
may
spread
far
as
its
wings
may
dare
and
through
it
all
one
voice
cries
god
is
love
and
love
is
god
around
within
above
behold
the
working
of
the
perfect
law
the
law
immutable
in
which
no
flaw
exists
and
from
which
no
appeal
is
made
as
the
sunlight
chases
far
the
shade
and
shadows
chase
the
light
in
turn
again
so
every
life
is
fraught
with
joy
and
pain
the
stinging
thorn
lies
hid
beside
the
rose
the
bud
is
blighted
ere
its
leave
unclose
so
pleasure
born
of
hope
may
yield
a
stinging
smart
of
thorns
a
barren
field
but
let
it
be
the
buds
will
bloom
again
the
fields
will
freshen
in
the
summer
rain
and
never
storm
scowls
dark
but
still
somewhere
a
bow
is
bending
in
the
upper
air
then
learn
the
law
if
thou
wouldst
live
aright
and
know
no
unseen
power
no
hand
of
might
can
set
aside
the
law
which
wheels
the
stars
no
incompleteness
its
perfection
mars
the
buds
will
wake
in
season
and
the
rain
will
fall
when
clouds
hang
heavy
and
again
the
snows
will
tremble
when
the
winter
breath
congeals
the
as
the
touch
of
death
congeals
the
last
drop
on
the
sufferer
cheek
thus
do
all
nature
tongues
in
chorus
speak
think
not
o
man
that
thou
canst
escape
one
jot
of
justice
law
nor
turn
thy
fate
by
yielding
sacrifice
to
the
unseen
purged
by
thyself
alone
canst
thou
be
clean
one
guide
to
happiness
thou
mayst
learn
toward
the
world
begets
love
in
and
if
to
others
you
the
measure
mete
of
love
be
sure
your
harvest
will
be
sweet
but
if
ye
sow
broadcast
the
seed
of
hate
ye
reap
again
albeit
ye
reap
it
late
then
let
your
swell
the
great
of
love
towards
all
the
world
the
world
is
wide
the
sea
of
life
is
broad
its
waves
stretch
far
no
range
no
barrier
its
sweep
may
bar
the
world
is
filled
is
trodden
down
with
pain
the
sea
of
life
is
gathered
up
of
rain
a
throat
a
bed
a
sink
for
human
tears
a
burial
of
hopes
a
miasm
of
fears
but
see
the
sun
of
love
shines
softly
out
flinging
its
golden
fingers
all
about
pressing
its
lips
in
loving
soft
caress
upon
the
world
pale
cheek
the
pain
grows
less
the
tears
are
dried
upon
the
quivering
lashes
an
answering
sunbeam
the
white
lids
flashes
the
sea
of
life
is
dimpled
with
smiles
the
sun
of
love
the
cloud
of
woe
beguiles
and
turns
its
heavy
brow
to
forehead
fair
framed
in
the
glory
of
its
hair
be
thine
the
warming
touch
the
kiss
of
love
vainly
ye
seek
for
comfort
from
above
vainly
ye
pray
the
gods
to
ease
your
pain
the
heavy
words
fall
back
on
you
again
vainly
ye
cry
for
christ
to
smooth
your
way
the
thorns
sting
sharper
while
ye
kneeling
pray
vainly
ye
look
upon
the
world
of
woe
and
cry
o
god
avert
the
bitter
blow
ye
can
not
turn
the
lightning
from
its
track
nor
call
one
single
little
instant
back
the
law
swerves
not
and
with
unerring
aim
the
shaft
of
justice
falls
he
bears
the
blame
who
violates
the
rule
do
well
your
task
for
justice
overtakes
you
all
at
last
vainly
ye
patient
ones
await
reward
trusting
th
almighty
angel
to
record
each
bitter
tear
each
disappointed
sigh
reward
descends
not
gifted
from
on
high
but
is
the
outgrowth
of
the
eternal
law
as
from
the
earth
the
toiling
draw
the
food
which
gives
them
life
and
strength
to
bear
the
storms
and
suns
which
sweep
the
upper
air
so
ye
must
draw
from
out
the
pregnant
earth
the
metal
true
wherewith
to
build
your
worth
so
shall
ye
brave
the
howling
of
the
blast
and
smile
triumphant
the
storm
at
last
nor
dream
these
trials
are
without
their
use
between
your
joys
and
griefs
ye
can
not
choose
and
say
your
life
with
either
is
complete
ever
the
bitter
mingles
with
the
sweet
the
dews
must
press
the
petals
down
at
night
if
in
the
dawning
they
would
glisten
bright
if
sunbeams
needs
must
ripen
out
the
grain
not
less
the
early
blades
must
woo
the
rain
if
now
your
eyes
be
wet
with
weary
tears
ye
gather
them
as
gems
in
after
years
and
if
the
rains
now
sodden
down
your
path
ye
reap
rich
harvest
in
the
aftermath
ye
idle
mourners
crying
in
your
grief
the
souls
ye
weep
have
found
the
long
relief
why
grieve
for
those
who
fold
their
hands
in
peace
their
hearts
have
found
a
glad
release
their
spirits
sink
into
the
solemn
sea
mourn
ye
the
prisoner
from
his
chains
let
free
nay
ope
your
ears
unto
the
living
cry
that
pleads
for
living
comfort
hark
the
sigh
of
million
heartaches
rising
in
your
ears
kiss
back
the
living
woes
the
living
tears
go
down
into
the
felon
gloomy
cell
send
there
the
ray
of
love
as
swell
when
spring
warm
breath
bids
the
cold
winter
cease
so
will
his
heart
swell
with
the
hope
of
peace
be
filled
with
love
for
love
is
nature
god
the
god
which
trembles
in
the
tender
sod
the
god
which
tints
the
sunset
lights
the
dew
sprinkles
with
stars
the
firmament
broad
blue
and
draws
all
hearts
together
in
a
free
wide
sweep
of
love
broad
as
the
no
other
law
or
guidance
do
we
need
the
world
our
church
to
do
good
is
our
creed
johns
to
my
mother
some
souls
there
are
which
never
live
their
life
some
suns
there
are
which
never
pierce
their
cloud
some
hearts
there
are
which
cup
their
perfume
in
and
yield
no
incense
to
the
outer
air
heart
such
is
thine
own
so
dost
thou
live
with
all
thy
brightness
hid
so
dost
thou
dwell
with
all
thy
perfume
close
rich
in
thy
treasured
wealth
aye
rich
indeed
and
they
are
wrong
who
say
thou
dost
not
feel
but
i
i
need
blue
air
and
opened
bloom
to
keep
my
music
means
that
it
must
die
and
when
the
thrill
the
joy
the
love
of
life
is
gone
i
too
am
dead
a
corpse
though
not
entombed
let
me
live
then
but
a
while
the
gloom
soon
comes
the
flower
closes
and
the
petals
shut
through
them
the
perfume
slips
out
like
a
soul
the
long
still
sleep
of
death
and
then
the
grave
march
betrayed
so
you
the
chaplain
you
need
say
what
you
have
come
for
i
can
guess
you
come
to
talk
about
jesus
love
and
repentance
and
rest
and
forgiveness
you
come
to
say
that
my
sin
is
great
yet
greater
the
mercy
heaven
will
mete
if
i
like
magdalen
bend
my
head
and
pour
my
tears
at
your
saviour
feet
your
promise
is
fair
but
i
little
faith
i
relied
on
promises
once
before
they
brought
me
to
this
this
prison
cell
with
its
window
its
grated
door
yet
he
too
was
fair
who
promised
me
with
his
tender
mouth
and
his
eyes
and
his
voice
was
as
sweet
as
the
summer
wind
that
sighs
through
the
arbors
of
paradise
and
he
seemed
to
me
all
that
was
good
and
pure
and
noble
and
strong
and
true
and
brave
i
had
given
the
pulse
of
my
heart
for
him
and
deemed
it
a
precious
boon
to
crave
you
say
that
jesus
so
loved
the
world
he
died
to
redeem
it
from
its
sin
it
is
redeemed
or
no
one
could
be
so
fair
without
and
so
black
within
i
trusted
his
promise
i
gave
my
life
the
truth
of
my
love
is
known
on
high
if
there
is
a
god
who
knows
all
things
his
promise
was
false
his
was
a
lie
it
was
over
soon
oh
soon
the
dream
and
me
he
had
called
his
life
his
light
he
drove
me
away
with
a
sneering
word
and
you
christians
said
that
it
served
me
right
i
was
proud
chaplain
even
then
i
set
my
face
in
the
teeth
of
fate
and
resolved
to
live
honestly
come
what
might
and
sink
beneath
neither
scorn
nor
hate
yes
and
i
prayed
that
the
christ
above
would
help
to
bear
the
bitter
cross
and
put
something
here
where
my
heart
had
been
to
fill
up
the
aching
void
of
loss
it
easy
for
you
to
say
what
i
should
do
but
none
of
you
ever
dream
how
hard
is
the
way
that
you
christians
make
for
us
with
your
sin
no
more
trust
the
lord
when
for
days
and
days
you
are
turned
from
work
with
cold
politeness
or
open
sneer
you
get
so
you
do
trust
a
god
whose
creatures
are
cold
and
they
so
near
you
hold
your
virtuous
lives
aloof
and
refuse
us
your
human
help
and
hand
and
set
us
apart
as
accursèd
things
marked
with
a
burning
brand
but
i
did
bend
though
many
days
i
was
weary
and
hungry
and
worn
and
weak
and
for
many
a
starless
night
i
watched
through
tears
that
grooved
down
my
pallid
cheek
they
are
all
dry
now
they
say
i
hard
because
i
never
weep
or
moan
you
ca
draw
blood
when
the
heart
bled
out
you
ca
find
tears
or
sound
in
a
stone
and
i
do
know
why
should
be
mild
and
meek
no
one
has
been
very
mild
to
me
you
say
that
jesus
would
be
perhaps
but
heaven
a
long
way
off
you
see
that
will
do
i
know
what
you
going
to
say
i
can
have
it
right
here
in
this
narrow
cell
the
is
slow
to
accept
christ
when
his
followers
chain
the
body
in
hell
not
but
i
just
as
well
off
here
better
perhaps
than
i
was
outside
the
world
was
a
to
me
where
i
dwelt
defying
and
defied
i
do
know
but
i
think
more
of
what
you
say
if
given
us
both
a
common
lot
if
justice
to
me
had
been
justice
to
him
and
covered
our
names
with
an
equal
blot
but
they
took
him
into
the
social
court
and
pitied
and
said
been
led
astray
in
a
month
the
stain
on
name
had
passed
as
a
cloud
that
crosses
the
face
of
day
he
joined
the
church
and
he
preaching
now
just
as
you
are
the
love
of
god
and
the
duty
of
sinners
to
kneel
and
pray
and
humbly
to
kiss
the
chastening
rod
if
they
dealt
with
me
as
they
dealt
by
him
may
be
i
credit
your
christian
love
if
they
dealt
with
him
as
they
dealt
by
me
i
have
more
faith
in
a
just
above
i
do
know
but
sometimes
i
used
to
think
that
she
who
was
told
there
was
no
room
in
the
inn
at
bethlehem
might
look
down
with
softened
eyes
thro
the
starless
gloom
christ
was
a
woman
he
could
know
the
pain
and
endurance
of
it
but
the
mother
who
bore
him
she
might
know
and
mary
in
heaven
might
pity
me
still
that
was
useless
it
did
bring
a
single
mouthful
for
me
to
eat
nor
work
to
get
it
nor
sheltering
from
the
dreary
wind
and
the
howling
street
heavenly
pity
wo
pass
as
coin
and
earthly
shame
brings
a
higher
pay
sometimes
i
was
tempted
to
give
it
up
and
go
like
others
the
easier
way
but
i
did
no
sir
i
kept
my
oath
though
my
baby
lay
in
my
arms
and
cried
and
at
last
to
spare
it
i
poisoned
it
and
kissed
its
murdered
lips
when
it
died
i
never
seen
him
since
it
was
born
he
said
that
it
his
you
know
but
i
took
its
body
and
laid
it
down
at
the
steps
of
his
door
in
the
pallid
glow
of
the
winter
morning
and
when
he
came
with
a
hummed
on
those
lips
of
lies
it
lay
at
his
feet
with
its
pinched
white
face
staring
up
at
him
from
its
dead
blue
eyes
i
had
closed
them
they
were
like
his
and
so
was
the
mouth
and
the
curled
gold
hair
and
every
feature
so
like
his
own
for
i
am
dark
sir
and
he
is
fair
was
a
moment
of
triumph
that
showed
me
yet
there
was
a
passion
i
could
feel
when
i
saw
him
bend
its
meagre
form
and
starting
backwards
cry
out
and
reel
if
there
a
time
when
all
souls
shall
meet
the
reward
of
the
deeds
that
are
done
in
the
clay
when
accused
and
accuser
stand
face
to
face
he
will
cry
out
so
in
the
judgment
day
the
rest
oh
nothing
they
hunted
me
and
with
virtuous
lawyers
virtuous
tears
to
a
virtuous
jury
convicted
me
and
i
sentenced
to
stay
here
for
twenty
years
do
i
repent
yes
i
do
but
wait
till
i
tell
you
of
what
i
repent
and
why
i
repent
that
i
ever
believed
a
man
could
be
anything
but
a
living
lie
i
repent
because
every
noble
thought
or
hope
or
ambition
or
earthly
trust
is
as
dead
as
bones
in
me
as
dead
as
my
child
in
its
murdered
dust
do
i
repent
that
i
killed
the
babe
am
i
repentant
for
that
you
ask
i
answer
the
truth
as
i
feel
it
sir
i
leave
to
others
the
pious
mask
am
i
repentant
because
i
saved
its
starving
body
from
teeth
because
i
hastened
what
time
would
do
to
spare
it
pain
and
relieve
its
death
am
i
repentant
because
i
held
it
were
better
a
should
have
no
name
than
a
whose
only
care
must
come
from
a
mother
weighed
with
shame
am
i
repentant
because
i
thought
it
were
better
the
tiny
form
lay
hid
from
the
heartless
stings
of
a
brutal
world
unknown
unnamed
a
coffin
lid
am
i
repentant
for
the
act
the
last
on
earth
in
my
power
to
save
from
the
misery
of
life
in
the
early
death
and
the
painless
grave
i
that
i
did
it
start
if
you
will
i
repeat
it
over
i
say
i
no
i
neither
a
fiend
nor
a
maniac
do
look
as
if
i
were
going
mad
did
i
not
love
it
yes
i
loved
with
a
strength
that
you
sir
can
never
feel
it
only
a
strong
love
can
kill
to
save
tho
itself
be
torn
where
time
can
not
heal
you
see
my
hands
they
are
red
with
its
blood
yet
i
would
have
cut
them
bit
by
bit
and
fed
them
and
smiled
to
see
it
eat
if
that
would
have
saved
and
nourished
it
beg
i
beg
and
pray
i
pray
god
was
as
stony
and
hard
as
earth
and
christ
was
as
deaf
as
the
stars
that
watched
or
the
night
that
darkened
above
his
birth
and
i
i
feel
stony
now
too
like
them
deaf
to
sorrow
and
mute
to
grief
am
i
heartless
yes
torn
gone
all
gone
like
my
dead
belief
do
i
not
fear
for
the
judgment
hour
so
unrepentant
so
hard
and
cold
wait
it
is
little
i
trust
in
that
but
if
ever
the
scrolled
sky
shall
be
uprolled
and
the
lives
of
men
shall
be
read
and
known
and
their
acts
be
judged
by
their
very
worth
and
the
christ
you
speak
of
shall
come
again
and
the
thunders
of
justice
shake
the
earth
you
will
hear
the
cry
who
murdered
here
come
forth
to
the
judgment
false
heart
and
eyes
that
pulsed
with
accurséd
strength
of
lust
and
loaded
faith
with
envenomed
lies
come
forth
to
the
judgment
haughty
dames
who
scathed
the
mother
with
your
scorn
and
answer
here
to
the
poisoned
child
decreed
its
murder
ere
it
was
born
come
forth
to
the
judgment
ye
who
heaped
the
gold
of
earth
in
your
treasured
hoard
and
answer
to
those
who
stood
all
naked
and
starving
beneath
your
board
depart
accurséd
i
know
you
not
ye
heeded
not
the
command
of
heaven
the
least
of
these
ye
give
it
is
even
unto
the
master
given
judgment
ah
sir
to
see
that
day
i
willingly
pass
thro
a
hundred
hells
i
believe
then
the
justice
that
hears
each
voice
buried
alive
in
these
prison
cells
but
no
it
not
that
that
will
never
be
i
trusted
too
long
and
he
answered
not
there
no
avenging
god
on
high
we
live
we
struggle
and
does
justice
come
and
o
future
years
sorely
ye
reap
and
in
weary
pain
when
ye
garner
the
sheaves
that
are
sown
when
the
clouds
that
are
gathering
fall
in
rain
the
time
will
come
aye
the
time
come
when
the
child
ye
conceive
in
lust
and
shame
quickened
will
mow
you
like
swaths
of
grass
with
a
sickle
born
of
steel
and
flame
aye
tremble
shrink
in
your
drunken
den
coward
traitor
and
child
of
lie
the
unerring
avenger
stands
close
to
you
and
the
dread
hour
of
parturition
nigh
aye
wring
your
hands
for
the
air
is
black
thickly
the
whirl
and
swarm
see
yonder
on
the
horizon
verge
play
the
of
the
coming
storm
july
optimism
there
a
love
supreme
in
the
great
hereafter
the
buds
of
earth
are
blooms
in
heaven
the
smiles
of
the
world
are
ripples
of
laughter
when
back
to
its
aidenn
the
soul

thy

the

wearily
grows
o

all
the
aching
of
thy

february
bastard
born
why
do
you
clothe
me
with
scarlet
of
shame
why
do
you
point
with
your
finger
of
scorn
what
is
the
crime
that
you
hissingly
name
when
you
sneer
in
my
ears
thou
bastard
born
am
i
not
as
the
rest
of
you
with
a
hope
to
reach
and
a
dream
to
live
with
a
soul
to
suffer
a
heart
to
know
the
pangs
that
the
thrusts
of
the
heartless
give
i
am
no
monster
look
at
me
straight
in
my
eyes
that
they
do
not
shrink
is
there
aught
in
them
you
can
see
to
merit
this
hemlock
you
make
me
drink
this
poison
that
scorches
my
soul
like
fire
that
burns
and
burns
until
love
is
dry
and
i
shrivel
with
hate
as
hot
as
a
pyre
a
corpse
while
its
smoke
curls
up
to
the
sky
will
you
touch
my
hand
it
is
flesh
like
yours
perhaps
a
little
more
brown
and
grimed
for
it
could
not
be
white
while
the
drawers
and
hewers
my
brothers
were
calloused
and
darkened
and
slimed
yet
touch
it
it
is
no
criminal
hand
no
children
are
toiling
to
keep
it
fair
it
is
free
from
the
curse
of
the
stolen
land
it
is
clean
of
the
theft
of
the
sea
and
air
it
has
set
no
seals
to
a
murderous
law
to
sign
a
bitter
black
league
with
death
no
covenants
false
do
these
fingers
draw
in
the
name
of
the
state
to
barter
faith
it
bears
no
stain
of
the
yellow
gold
that
earth
wretches
give
as
the
cost
of
heaven
no
priestly
garment
of
silken
fold
i
wear
as
the
price
of
their
sins
forgiven
still
do
you
shrink
still
i
hear
the
hiss
between
your
teeth
and
i
feel
the
scorn
that
flames
in
your
gaze
well
what
is
this
this
crime
i
commit
being
bastard
born
what
you
whisper
my
eyes
are
gray
the
color
of
hers
up
there
on
the
hill
where
the
white
stone
gleams
and
the
willow
spray
falls
over
her
grave
in
the
starlight
still
my
hands
are
shaped
like
those
quiet
hands
folded
away
from
their
life
their
care
and
the
sheen
that
lies
on
my
short
fair
strands
gleams
darkly
down
on
her
buried
hair
my
voice
is
toned
like
that
silent
tone
that
might
if
it
could
break
up
through
the
sod
with
such
rebuke
as
would
shame
your
stone
stirring
the
in
their
clod
and
my
thrill
to
the
same
strong
chords
and
the
blood
that
was
hers
is
mine
and
the
thoughts
she
loved
i
love
and
the
words
that
meant
most
to
her
to
me
most
say
was
my
mother
i
her
child
could
ten
thousand
priests
have
made
us
more
do
you
curse
the
bloom
of
the
heather
wild
do
you
trample
the
flowers
and
cry
impure
do
you
shun
the
silver
shower
does
their
music
arouse
your
curling
scorn
that
none
but
god
blessed
them
the
whitest
flower
the
purest
song
were
but
bastard
born
is
my
i
was
born
of
her
is
my
that
i
reverence
deep
god
that
her
pale
corpse
may
not
stir
press
closer
down
on
her
lids
the
sleep
would
you
have
me
hate
her
me
who
knew
that
the
gentlest
soul
in
the
world
looked
there
out
of
the
gray
eyes
that
pitied
you
while
you
cursed
her
the
long
brown
hair
that
waved
from
her
forehead
has
brushed
my
cheek
when
her
soft
lips
have
drunk
up
my
salt
of
grief
and
the
voice
whose
echo
you
hate
would
speak
the
hush
of
pity
and
love
relief
and
those
still
hands
that
are
folded
now
have
touched
my
sorrows
for
years
away
would
you
have
me
question
her
whence
and
how
the
streamed
from
her
heart
deep
ray
do
you
question
the
sun
that
it
gives
its
gold
do
you
scowl
at
the
cloud
when
it
pours
its
rain
till
the
fields
that
were
withered
and
burnt
and
old
are
fresh
and
tender
and
young
again
do
you
search
the
source
of
the
breeze
that
sweeps
the
rush
of
the
fever
from
tortured
brain
do
you
ask
whence
the
perfume
that
round
you
creeps
when
your
soul
is
wrought
to
the
quick
with
pain
she
was
my
sun
my
dew
my
air
the
highest
the
purest
the
holiest
was
the
shade
of
her
beautiful
hair
was
all
that
i
knew
on
her
breast
would
you
have
me
forget
or
remembering
say
that
her
love
had
bloomed
from
hell
then
be
and
let
heaven
sing
deum
until
it
swell
and
ring
and
roll
to
the
utterest
earth
that
the
damned
are
free
since
out
of
sin
came
the
whiteness
that
shamed
all
ransomed
worth
till
god
opened
the
gates
saying
enter
in
what
in
the
face
of
the
witness
i
bear
to
her
measureless
love
and
her
purity
still
of
your
hate
would
you
make
me
to
share
despising
that
she
gave
life
to
me
you
would
have
me
stand
at
her
helpless
grave
to
dig
through
its
earth
with
a
venomed
dart
this
is
honor
and
right
and
brave
to
fling
a
stone
at
her
pulseless
heart
this
is
virtue
to
blast
the
lips
speechless
beneath
the
silence
dread
to
lash
with
slander
scorpion
whips
the
voiceless
defenseless
helpless
dead
god
i
turn
to
an
adder
now
back
upon
you
i
hurl
your
scorn
bind
the
scarlet
upon
your
brow
it
is
who

me
not
these
hands
of
mine

with

by
your
sickly
gaslight

behold
the

with
the
foulness

hymn
this
hymn
was
written
at
the
request
of
a
christian
science
friend
who
proposed
to
set
it
to
music
it
did
not
represent
my
beliefs
either
then
or
since
but
rather
what
i
wish
might
be
my
beliefs
had
i
not
an
inexorable
capacity
for
seeing
things
as
they
are
a
vast
scheme
of
mutual
murder
with
no
justice
anywhere
and
no
god
in
the
soul
or
out
of
it
i
am
at
peace
no
storm
can
ever
touch
me
on
my
clear
heights
the
sunshine
only
falls
far
far
below
glides
the
phantom
voice
of
sorrows
in
light
the
silence
only
calls
ah
soul
ascend
the
mountain
way
bears
to
the
heights
whereon
the
blest
have
trod
lay
down
the
burden
stanch
the

bleeding

at
for

that
ye
are

not
long
the
way
not
far
in
a
dim
heaven
in
the
locked
self

ye
the

clear

its
rays
illumining
the
shadow
there
where
god
is
there
too
o
souls
ye
are
ye
are
at
one
and
bound
in
him
forever
as
the
wave
is
bound
in

never
to
drift
beyond

him
never
whole

bloomless
heather
unheeding
the
will

of
lightnings
high
when

rush
the
bolts
of
hate
from

you

i
when

bolts

falling
the
hot
air
torn
with

wild
cries

darkness

us
and
drown

laughter
of

the
years
in
flowing
have
left
us
behind
with
all
things
that
die
with
the
rot
of
our
bones
shall
give
soil
for
growing
the
loves
of
the
future
made
sweet
for
blowing
by
the
dew
of
the
kiss
of
a
last
the
toast
of
despair
we
have
cried
and
the
gods
are
silent
we
have
trusted
and
been
betrayed
we
have
loved
and
the
fruit
was
ashes
we
have
given
the
gift
was
weighed
we
know
that
the
heavens
are
empty
that
friendship
and
love
are
names
that
truth
is
an
ashen
cinder
the
end
of
life
flames
vainly
and
long
have
we
waited
through
the
night
of
the
human
roar
for
a
single
song
on
the
harp
of
hope
or
a
ray
from
a
shore
songs
aye
come
floating
marvelous
sweet
and
flashes
gleam
but
the
sweets
are
lies
and
the
weary
feet
run
after
a
beam
in
the
hour
of
our
need
the
song
departs
and
the
of
sorrow
swell
the
siren
mocks
with
a
gurgling
laugh
that
is
drowned
in
the
deep
the
light
we
chased
with
our
stumbling
feet
as
the
goal
of
happier
years
swings
high
and
low
and
vanishes
the
were
of
our
tears
god
is
a
lie
and
faith
is
a
lie
and
a
tenfold
lie
is
love
life
is
a
problem
without
a
why
and
never
a
thing
to
prove
it
adds
and
subtracts
and
multiplies
and
divides
without
aim
or
end
its
answers
all
false
though
true
wife
husband
lover
friend
we
know
it
now
and
we
care
no
more
what
matters
life
or
death
we
tiny
insects
emerge
from
earth
suffer
and
yield
our
breath
like
ants
we
crawl
on
our
brief
dreaming
of
mighty
things
lo
they
crunch
like
shells
in
the
ocean
wrath
in
the
rush
of
time
awful
wings
the
sun
smiles
gold
and
the
planets
white
and
a
billion
stars
smile
still
yet
fierce
as
we
each
wheels
towards
death
and
can
not
stay
his
will
then
build
ye
fools
your
mighty
things
that
time
shall
set
at
naught
grow
warm
with
the
song
the
sweet
lie
sings
and
the
false
bow
your
tears
have
wrought
for
us
a
truce
to
gods
loves
and
hopes
and
a
pledge
to
fire
and
wave
a
swifter
whirl
to
the
dance
of
death
and
a
loud
huzza
for
the
grave
in
memoriam
to
dyer
lum
my
friend
and
teacher
who
died
april
great
silent
heart
these
barren
drops
of
grief
are
not
for
you
attained
unto
your
rest
this
sterile
salt
upon
the
withered
leaf
of
love
is
mine
mine
the
dark
burial
guest
far
far
within
that
deep
untroubled
sea
we
watched
together
walking
on
the
sands
your
soul
has
melted
painless
silent
free
mine
the
wrung
heart
mine
the
clasped
useless
hands
into
the
whirl
of
life
where
none
remember
i
bear
your
image
ever
unforgot
the
still
wailing
in
december
cries
the
same
cry
cries
cries
and
ceases
not
the
future
years
with
all
their
waves
of
faces
roll
shoreward
singing
the
great
undertone
yours
is
not
there
in
the
old
places
i
look
and
pass
and
watch
the
sea
alone
alone
along
the
gleaming
white
the
spraying
thick
around
my
head
through
all
the
beat
of
waves
and
winds
that
roar
i
go
remembering
that
you
are
dead
that
you
are
dead
and
nowhere
is
there
one
like
unto
you
and
nowhere
love
leaps
death
and
nowhere
may
the
broken
race
be
run
nowhere
unsealed
the
seal
that
none
gainsaith
yet
in
my
ear
that
deep
sweet
undertone
grows
deeper
sweeter
solemner
to
me
dreaming
your
dreams
watching
the
light
that
shone
so
whitely
to
you
yonder
on
the
sea
your
voice
is
there
there
in
the
great
your
eyes
are
there
out
there
within
the
light
your
heart
within
the
pulsing
drowned
beats
in
the
immortality
of
right
o
life
i
love
you
for
the
love
of
him
who
showed
me
all
your
glory
and
your
pain
unto
nirvana
so
the
deep
tones
sing
and
there
and
there
we
shall
be
one
again
april
out
of
the
darkness
who
am
i
only
one
of
the
commonest
common
people
only
a
body
a
shriveled
and
withered
soul
what
right
have
i
to
sing
then
none
and
i
do
not
i
can
not
why
ruin
the
rhythm
and
rhyme
of
the
great
world
songs
with
moaning
i
know
not
nor
why
whistles
must
shriek
wheels
ceaselessly
mutter
nor
why
all
i
touch
turns
to
clanging
and
clashing
and
discord
i
know
not
i
know
only
this
i
was
born
to
this
live
in
it
hourly
go
round
with
it
hum
with
it
curse
with
it
would
laugh
with
it
had
it
laughter
it
is
my
breath
and
that
breath
goes
outward
from
me
in
moaning
o
you
up
there
i
have
heard
you
i
am
god
image
defaced
in
heaven
reward
awaits
me
hereafter
i
shall
be
perfect
ages
you
sung
that
song
but
what
is
it
to
me
think
you
if
you
heard
down
here
in
the
smoke
and
the
smut
in
the
smear
and
the
offal
in
the
dust
in
the
mire
in
the
grime
and
in
the
slime
in
the
hideous
darkness
how
the
wheels
turn
your
song
into
sounds
of
horror
and
loathing
and
cursing
the
offer
of
lust
the
sneer
of
contempt
and
acceptance
whispers
the
laugh
of
the
gambler
the
suicide
gasp
the
yell
of
the
drunkard
if
you
heard
them
down
here
you
would
cry
the
reward
of
such
is
damnation
if
you
heard
them
i
say
your
song
of
rewarded
hereafter
would
fail
you
too
with
your
science
your
titles
your
books
and
your
long
explanations
that
tell
me
how
i
am
come
up
out
of
the
dust
of
the
cycles
out
of
the
sands
of
the
sea
out
of
the
unknown
primeval
forests
out
of
the
growth
of
the
world
have
become
the
bud
and
the
promise
out
of
the
race
of
the
beasts
have
arisen
proud
and
triumphant
you
if
you
knew
how
your
words
rumble
round
in
the
wheels
of
labor
if
you
knew
how
my
hammering
heart
beats
liar
liar
you
lie
out
of
all
buds
of
the
earth
we
are
most
blasted
and
blighted
what
beast
of
all
the
beasts
is
not
prouder
and
freer
than
we
you
too
who
sing
in
high
words
of
the
glory
of
man
universal
the
beauty
of
sacrifice
debt
of
the
future
the
present
immortal
the
glory
of
use
absorption
by
death
of
the
being
in
being
you
if
you
knew
what
jargon
it
makes
down
here
would
be
quiet
oh
is
there
no
one
to
find
or
to
speak
a
meaning
to
to
me
as
i
am
the
hard
the
ignorant
worker
to
me
upon
whom
god
and
science
alike
have
stamped
failure
to
me
who
know
nothing
but
labor
nothing
but
sweat
dirt
and
sorrow
to
me
whom
you
scorn
and
despise
you
up
there
who
sing
while
i
moan
to
me
as
i
am
for
me
as
i
am
not
dying
but
living
my
future
my

my

all
this

april

the
dust
of
a
hundred
years
is
on
thy
breast
and
thy
day
and
thy
night
of
tears
are
centurine
rest
thou
to
whom
joy
was
dumb
life
a
broken
rhyme

thy
smiling
time
is
come
and
our
weeping
time
thou
who
hadst
sponge
and
myrrh
and
a
bitter
cross
smile
for
the
day
is
here
that
we
know
our
loss
loss
of
thine
undone
deed
thy
unfinished
song
th
unspoken
word
for
our
need
th
unrighted
wrong
smile
for
we
weep
we
weep
for
the
unsoothed
pain
the
unbound
wound
burned
deep
that
we
might
gain
mother
of
sorrowful
eyes
in
the
dead
old
days
mother
of
many
sighs
of
ways
mother
of
resolute
feet
through
all
the
thorns
mother
lo
after
storms
have
broken
and
beat
thy
dust
for
a
hundred
years
thy
memory
is
made
just
and
the
just
man
hears
thy
children
kneel
and
repeat
though
dust
be
dust
though
sod
and
coffin
and
sheet
and
moth
and
rust
have
folded
and
molded
and
pressed
yet
they
can
not
kill
in
the
heart
of
the
world
at
rest
she
liveth
still
april
the
gods
and
the
people
what
have
you
done
o
skies
that
the
millions
should
kneel
to
you
why
should
they
lift
wet
eyes
grateful
with
human
dew
why
should
they
clasp
their
hands
and
bow
at
thy
shrines
o
heaven
thanking
thy
high
commands
for
the
mercies
that
thou
hast
given
what
have
those
mercies
been
o
thou
who
art
called
the
good
who
trod
through
a
world
of
sin
and
stood
where
the
felon
stood
what
is
that
wondrous
peace
vouchsafed
to
the
child
of
dust
for
whom
all
doubt
shall
cease
in
the
light
of
thy
perfect
trust
how
hast
thou
heard
their
prayers
smoking
up
from
the
bleeding
sod
who
crushed
by
their
weight
of
cares
cried
up
to
thee
most
high
god
where
the
swamps
of
humanity
sicken
read
the
answer
in
dumb
white
scars
you
skies
gave
the
sore
and
the
stricken
the
light
of
your
stars
the
children
who
plead
are
driven
shelterless
through
the
street
receiving
the
mercy
of
heaven
in
glittering
sleet
the
women
who
prayed
for
pity
who
called
on
the
saving
name
through
the
walks
of
your
merciless
city
are
crying
the
rent
of
shame
the
starving
who
gazed
on
the
plenty
in
which
they
might
not
share
have
died
in
their
hunger
rent
by
the
anguish
of
unheard
prayer
the
weary
who
plead
for
remission
for
a
moment
only
release
have
sunk
with
unheeded
petition
this
is
the
peace
these
are
the
mercies
of
heaven
these
are
the
answers
of
god
to
the
prayers
of
the
from
the
paths
where
the
millions
plod
the
silent
scorn
of
the
sightless
the
callous
ear
of
the
deaf
the
wrath
of
might
to
the
mightless
the
shroud
and
the
mourning
sheaf
light
to
behold
their
squalor
breath
to
draw
in
life
pain
voices
to
plead
and
call
for
heaven
help
hearts
to
bleed
in
vain
what
have
you
done
o
church
that
the
weary
should
bless
your
name
should
come
with
faith
holy
torch
to
light
up
your
altar
fane
why
should
they
kiss
the
folds
of
the
garment
of
your
high
priest
or
bow
to
the
chalice
that
holds
the
wine
of
your
sacred
feast
have
you
blown
out
the
breath
of
their
sighs
have
you
strengthened
the
weak
the
ill
have
you
wiped
the
dark
tears
from
their
eyes
and
bade
their
sobbings
be
still
have
you
touched
have
you
known
have
you
felt
have
you
bent
and
softly
smiled
in
the
face
of
the
woman
who
dwelt
in
lewdness
to
feed
her
child
have
you
heard
the
cry
in
the
night
going
up
from
the
outraged
heart
masked
from
the
social
sight
by
the
cloak
that
but
angered
the
smart
have
you
heard
the
children
moan
by
the
light
of
the
skies
denied
answer
o
walls
of
stone
in
the
name
of
your
crucified
out
of
the
clay
of
their
from
the
red
dew
of
its
sod
you
have
mortar
your
brick
for
christ
sake
and
reared
a
palace
to
god
your
painters
have
dipped
their
brushes
in
the
tears
and
the
blood
of
the
race
whom
living
your
dark
frown
crushes
and
limned
a
dead
savior
face
you
have
seized
in
the
name
of
god
the
child
crust
from
famine
dole
you
have
taken
the
price
of
its
body
and
sung
a
mass
for
its
soul
you
have
smiled
on
the
man
who
deceiving
paid
exemption
to
ease
your
wrath
you
have
cursed
the
poor
fool
who
believed
him
though
her
body
lay
prone
in
your
path
you
have
laid
the
seal
on
the
lip
you
have
bid
us
to
be
content
to
bow
our
master
whip
and
give
thanks
for
the
scourge
sent
these
o
church
are
your
thanks
these
are
the
fruits
without
flaw
that
flow
from
the
chosen
ranks
who
keep
in
your
perfect
law
doors
on
the
homeless
stained
glass
windows
for
bread
on
the
living
the
law
of
dumbness
and
the
law
of
need
for
the
better
the
dead
who
not
needing
go
down
to
the
vaults
of
the
earth
than
the
living
whose
hearts
lie
bleeding
crushed
by
you
at
their
very
birth
what
have
you
done
o
state
that
the
toilers
should
shout
your
ways
should
light
up
the
fires
of
their
hate
if
a
traitor
should
dare
dispraise
how
do
you
guard
the
trust
that
the
people
repose
in
you
do
you
keep
to
the
law
of
the
just
and
hold
to
the
changeless
true
what
do
you
mean
when
you
say
the
home
of

free
and
brave
how
free
are
your
people
pray
have
you
no
such
thing
as
a
slave
what
are
the
lauded
rights
by
your
sovereign
grace
what
are
the
sights
you
yield
to
your
subject
race
the
rights
ah
the
right
to
toil
that
another
idle
may
reap
the
right
to
make
fruitful
the
soil
and
a
meagre
pittance
to
keep
the
right
of
a
woman
to
own
her
body
spotlessly
pure
and
starve
in
the
street
alone
the
right
of
the
wronged
to
endure
the
right
of
the
slave
to
his
yoke
the
right
of
the
hungry
to
pray
the
right
of
the
toiler
to
vote
for
the
master
who
buys
his
day
you
have
sold
the
sun
and
the
air
you
have
dealt
in
the
price
of
blood
you
have
taken
the
lion
share
while
the
lion
is
fierce
for
food
you
have
laid
the
load
of
the
strong
on
the
helpless
the
young
the
weak
you
have
trod
out
the
purple
of
wrong
beware
where
its
wrath
shall
wreak
let
the
voice
of
the
people
be
heard
o
you
strangled
it
with
your
rope
denied
the
last
dying
word
while
your
trap
and
your
gallows
spoke
but
a
thousand
voices
rise
where
the
words
of
the
martyr
fell
the
seed
springs
fast
to
the
skies
watered
deep
from
that
bloody
well
hark
low
down
you
will
hear
the
storm
in
the
underground
listen
tyrants
and
fear
quake
at
that
muffled
sound
heavens
that
mocked
our
dust
smile
on
in
your
pitiless
blue
silent
as
you
are
to
us
so
silent
are
we
to
you
churches
that
scourged
our
brains
priests
that
locked
fast
our
hands
we
planted
the
torch
in
your
chains
now
gather
the
burning
brands
states
that
have
given
us
law
when
we
asked
for
the
right
to
earn
bread
the
sword
that
damocles
saw
by
a
hair
swings
over
your
head
what
ye
have
sown
ye
shall
reap
teardrops
and
blood
and
hate
gaunt
gather
before
your
seat
and
knock
at
your
palace
gate
there
are
murderers
on
your
thrones
there
are
thieves
in
your
white
leprosy
cancers
their
stones
and
gnaws
at
their
walls
and
the
hand
of
belshazzar
feast
writes
over
in
flaming
light
kingdom
no
more
to
the
priest
nor
the
law
of
right
unto
john
altgeld
after
an
incarceration
of
six
long
years
in
joliet
state
prison
for
an
act
of
which
they
were
entirely
innocent
namely
the
throwing
of
the
haymarket
bomb
in
chicago
may
oscar
neebe
michael
schwab
and
samuel
fielden
were
liberated
by
gov
altgeld
who
thus
sacrificed
his
political
career
to
an
act
of
justice
there
was
a
tableau
liberty
clear
light
shone
never
on
a
braver
scene
than
that
here
was
a
prison
there
a
man
who
sat
high
in
the
halls
of
state
beyond
the
might
of
ignorance
and
mobs
whose
hireling
press
yells
at
their
bidding
like
the
slaver
hounds
ready
with
coarse
caprice
to
curse
or
bless
to
make
or
unmake
rulers
lo
there
sounds
a
grating
of
the
doors
and
three
poor
men
helpless
and
hated
having
naught
to
give
come
from
their
tomb
look
up
and
live
and
thank
this
man
that
they
are
free
again
and
he
to
all
the
world
this
man
dares
say
curse
as
you
will
i
have
been
just
this
day
june
the
cry
of
the
unfit
the
gods
have
left
us
the
creeds
have
crumbled
there
are
none
to
pity
and
none
to
care
our
fellows
have
crushed
us
where
we
have
stumbled
they
have
made
of
our
bodies
a
bleeding
stair
loud
rang
the
bells
in
the
christmas
steeples
we
heard
them
ring
through
the
bitter
morn
the
promise
of
old
to
the
weary
peoples
came
floating
sweetly
christ
is
born
but
the
words
were
mocking
sorely
mocking
as
we
sought
the
sky
through
our
freezing
tears
we
children
who
hung
the
christmas
stocking
and
found
it
empty
two
thousand
years
no
there
is
naught
in
the
old
creed
for
us
love
and
peace
are
to
those
who
win
to
them
the
delight
of
the
golden
chorus
to
us
the
hunger
and
shame
and
sin
why
then
live
on
since
our
lives
are
fruitless
since
peace
is
certain
and
death
is
rest
since
our
masters
tell
us
the
strife
is
bootless
and
nature
scorns
her
unwelcome
guest
you
who
have
climbed
on
our
aching
bodies
you
who
have
thought
because
we
have
toiled
priests
of
the
creed
of
a
newer
goddess
searchers
in
depths
where
the
past
was
foiled
speak
in
the
name
of
the
faith
that
you
cherish
give
us
the
truth
we
have
bought
it
with
woe
must
we
forever
thus
worthlessly
perish
burned
in
the
desert
and
lost
in
the
snow
trampled
forsaken
foredoomed
and
forgotten
helplessly
tossed
like
the
leaf
in
the
storm
bred
for
the
shambles
with
curses
begotten
useless
to
all
save
the
rotting
give
us
some
anchor
to
stay
our
mad
drifting
give
for
your
own
sakes
for
lo
where
our
blood
a
red
tide
to
drown
you
is
steadily
lifting
help
or
you
die
in
the
terrible
flood
in
memoriam
to
trumbull
no
man
better
than
trumbull

my
martyred
comrades

thy
breast
o

thy
child
he
whom
thou
garmentedst
in
steel
of
truth
and
sent
forth
strong
in
the
glad
heart
of
youth
to
sing
the
wakening
song
in
ears
beguiled
by
tyrants
promises
and
flatterers
smiles
these
searched
his
eyes
and
knew
nor
threats
nor
wiles
might
shake
the
steady
stars
within
their
blue
nor
win
one
truckling
word
from
off
those
lips
no
not
for

nor

nor

to
dash
the
sun

the
above
poem
was
suggested
by
the
reading
of
an
article
describing
an
interview
with
the
wandering
jew
in
which
he
was
represented
as
an
incorrigible
grumbler
the
jew
has
been
and
will
continue
to
be
the
grumbler
of
earth
until
the
prophetic
ideal
of
justice
shall
be
realized
blessed
be
he
go
on
thou
shalt
go
on
till
i
come
pale
ghostly
vision
from
the
coffined
years
planting
the
cross
with
thy
feet
stern
watcher
through
the
centuries
storm
and
beat
in
those
sad
eyes
between
those
grooves
of
tears
those
eyes
like
caves
where
sunlight
never
dwells
and
stars
but
dimly
shine
stand
sentinels
that
watch
with
patient
hope
through
weary
days
that
somewhere
sometime
he
indeed
may
come
and
thou
at
last
find
thee
a
resting
place
leaf
of
man
within
the
tomb
aye
they
have
cursed
thee
with
the
bitter
curse
and
driven
thee
with
scourges
the
world
tyrants
have
crushed
thee
ignorance
has
hurled
its
black
anathema
but
death
pale
hearse
that
bore
them
graveward
passed
them
silently
and
vainly
didst
thou
stretch
thy
hands
and
cry
take
me
instead
not
yet
for
thee
the
time
not
yet
not
yet
thy
bruised
and
mangled
limbs
must
still
drag
on
still
feed
the
vulture
crime
with
bleeding
flesh
till
rust
its
steel
beak
dims
aye
till
he
come
freedom
justice
till
then
shalt
thou
cry
warning
through
the
earth
unheeding
pain
untouched
by
death
and
birth
proclaiming
woe
woe
woe
till
men
shall
cease
to
seek
for
christ
within
the
senseless
skies
and
joyous
find
him
in
each
other
eyes
then
shall
be
builded
such
a
tomb
for
thee
shall
beggar
kings
as
diamonds
outshine

the
universal
heart
of
man
shall
be
the
sacred
urn
of
the
accursed
jew
the
feast
of

the
three
anarchists
vaillant
henry

caserio
were
led
to
their
several
executions
a
voice
from
the
prison
cried
loudly
vive
through
watch
and
ward
the
cry
escaped
and
no
man
owned
the
voice
but
the
cry
is
still
resounding
through
the
world
a
moan
in
the
gloam
in

wild
fierce

defense

of

none
appears
so
utterly
stupid
as
the
law
which
punishes
an
attempted
suicide
to
the
question
what
have
you
to
say
in
your
defense
i
conceive
the
poor
wretch
might
reply
as
follows
to
say
in
my
defense
defense
of
what
defense
to
whom
and
why
defense
at
all
have
i
wronged
any
let
that
one
accuse
some
priest
there
mutters
i
have
outraged
god
let
god
then
try
me
and
let
none
dare
judge
himself
as
fit
to
put
heaven
ermine
on
again
i
say
let
the
wronged
one
accuse
aye
silence
there
is
none
to
answer
me
and
whom
could
i
a
homeless
friendless
tramp
to
whom
all
doors
are
shut
all
hearts
are
locked
all
hands
withheld
whom
could
i
wrong
indeed
by
taking
that
which
benefited
none
and
menaced
all
aye
since
ye
will
it
so
know
then
your
risk
but
mark
is
not
defense
is
accusation
that
i
hurl
at
you
see
that
ye
prepare
your
own
defense
my
life
i
say
is
an
eternal
threat
to
you
and
yours
and
therefore
it
were
well
to
have
foreborne
your
unasked
services
and
why
because
i
hate
you
every
drop
of
blood
that
circles
in
your
plethoric
veins
was
wrung
from
out
the
gaunt
and
sapless
trunks
of
men
like
me
who
in
your
cursed
mills
were
crushed
like
grapes
within
the
ground
to
us
ye
leave
the
empty
skin
of
life
the
heart
of
it
the
sweet
of
it
ye
pour
to
fete
your
dogs
and
mistresses
withal
your
mistresses
our
daughters
bought
for
bread
to
grace
the
flesh
that
once
was

yes
i
accuse
you
that
ye
murdered
me
ye
killed
the
man
and
this
that
speaks
to
you
is
but
the
beast
that
ye
have
made
of
me
what
is
it
life
to
creep
and
crawl
and
beg
and
slink
for
shelter
where
rats
congregate
and
for
one
ideal
dream
of
a
fat
meal
is
it
then
life
to
group
like
pigs
in
sties
and
bury
decency
in
common
filth
because
forsooth
your
income
must
be
made
though
human
flesh
rot
in
your
dens
is
it
then
life
to
wait
another
nod
for
leave
to
turn
yourself
to
gold
for
him
would
it
be
life
to
you
and
was
i
less
than
you
was
i
not
born
with
hopes
and
dreams
and
pains
and
passions
even
as
were
you
but
these
ye
have
denied
ye
seized

though
it
was
none
of
yours
and
said
hereon

ye
render
tribute
every

of

born
to

of
the

ye
also
seized
and
made
a
tenfold
curse

crush
the

he
made

and

all
all
are
yours

whose
tears
made
that
fruit
root
wet
yet
thou
drivest
me
forth
with
a
sword
and
thy
guards
by
the
gate
are
set
thou
wilt
give
me
up
to
the
fire
and
none
shall
deliver
me
for
i
followed
my
heart
desire
and
i
labored
not
for
thee
i
labored
for
him
thou
hast
set
on
thy
right
hand
high
and
fair
thou
lovest
him
lord
and
yet
was
my
love
won
him
there
but
this
is
the
thing
that
hath
been
hath
been
since
the
world
began
that
love
against
self
must
sin
and
a
woman
die
for
a
man
and
this
is
the
thing
that
shall
be
shall
be
till
the
whole
world
die
my
doom
is
on
me

the

builders
who
built
the
beautiful
roads
queried
a
friend
of
the
present
order
as
we
walked
one
day
along
the
macadamised
driveway
of
fairmount
park
i
saw
them
toiling
in
the
blistering
sun
their
dull
dark
faces
leaning
toward
the
stone
their
knotted
fingers
grasping
the
rude
tools
their
rounded
shoulders
narrowing
in
their
chest
the
sweat
drops
dripping
in
great
painful
beads
i
saw
one
fall
his
forehead
on
the
rock
the
helpless
hand
still
clutching
at
the
spade
the
slack
mouth
full
of
earth
and
he
was
dead
his
comrades
gently
turned
his
face
until
the
fierce
sun
glittered
hard
upon
his
eyes
wide
open
staring
at
the
cruel
sky
the
blood
yet
ran
upon
the
jagged
stone
but
it
was
ended
he
was
quite
quite
dead
driven
to
death
beneath
the
burning
sun
driven
to
death
upon
the
road
he
built
he
was
no
hero
he
a
poor
black
man
taking
the
will
of
god
and
asking
naught
think
of
him
thus
when
next
your
horse
feet
strike
out
the
flint
spark
from
the
gleaming
road
think
that
for
this
this
common
thing
the
road
a
human
creature
died
is
a
blood
gift
to
an
world
that
does
not
thank
ignorant
mean
and
soulless
was
he
well
still
human
and
you
drive
upon
his
corpse

we
are
the
souls
that
crept
and
cried
in
the
days
when
they
tortured
men
his
was
the
spirit
that
walked
erect
and
met
the
beast
in
its
den
ours
are
the
eyes
that
were
dim
with
tears
for
the
thing
they
shrunk
to
see
his
was
the
glance
that
was
crystal
keen
with
the
light
that
makes
men
free
ours
are
the
hands
that
were
wrung
in
pain
in
helpless
pain
and
shame
his
was
the
resolute
hand
that
struck
steady
and
keen
to
its
aim
ours
are
the
lips
that
quivered
with
rage
that
cursed
and
prayed
in
a
breath
his
was
the
mouth
that
opened
but
once
to
speak
from
the
throat
of
death
assassin
assassin
the

cries
out
with

of
its

the

are
the

the

the

at

springing
springing
at
every

the

invincible

the

the

calling
loud
down
the

ranks
of

for
these

the

where
the
loud

echoes
again
that

in

murdered

left
a

with

to
pray
for
alms
in
the

a

scarlet
shame
till
their

will
be

where
they

the

the

the

if
one
looks
searchingly
is
limned
the
shadow
line
of
an
idea
an
idea
dead
or
living
sometimes
stronger
when
dead
with
rigid
unswerving
lines
that
mark
the
living
embodiment
with
the
stern
immobile
cast
of
the
daily
we
move
among
these
unyielding
shadows
less
pierceable
more
enduring
than
granite
with
the
blackness
of
ages
in
them
dominating
living
changing
bodies
with
dead
unchanging
souls
and
we
meet
also
living
souls
dominating
dying
bodies
living
ideas
regnant
over
decay
and
death
do
not
imagine
that
i
speak
of
human
life
alone
the
stamp
of
persistent
or
of
shifting
will
is
visible
in
the
rooted
in
its
clod
of
earth
as
in
the
gossamer
web
of
being
that
floats
and
swims
far
over
our
heads
in
the
free
world
of
air
regnant
ideas
everywhere
did
you
ever
see
a
dead
vine
bloom
i
have
seen
it
last
summer
i
trained
some
vines
up
over
a
balcony
and
every
day
they
blew
and
curled
in
the
wind
their
white
faces
winking
at
the
sun
radiant
with
climbing
life
higher
every
day
the
green
heads
crept
carrying
their
train
of
spreading
fans
waving
before
the
blossoms
then
all
at
once
some
mischance
happened
some
or
some
mischievous
child
tore
one
vine
off
below
the
finest
and
most
ambitious
one
of
course
in
a
few
hours
the
leaves
hung
limp
the
sappy
stem
wilted
and
began
to
wither
in
a
day
it
was
dead
all
but
the
top
which
still
clung
longingly
to
its
support
with
bright
head
lifted
i
mourned
a
little
for
the
buds
that
could
never
open
now
and
pitied
that
proud
vine
whose
work
in
the
world
was
lost
but
the
next
night
there
was
a
storm
a
heavy
driving
storm
with
beating
rain
and
blinding
lightning
i
rose
to
watch
the
flashes
and
lo
the
wonder
of
the
world
in
the
blackness
of
the
in
the
fury
of
wind
and
rain
the
dead
vine
had
flowered
five
white
blossoms
blew
gaily
round
the
skeleton
vine
shining
back
triumphant
at
the
red
lightning
i
gazed
at
them
in
dumb
wonder
dear
dead
vine
whose
will
had
been
so
strong
to
bloom
that
in
the
hour
of
its
sudden
from
the
feeding
earth
it
sent
the
last
sap
to
its
blossoms
and
not
waiting
for
the
morning
brought
them
forth
in
storm
and
flash
as
white
which
should
have
been
the
children
of
the
sun
in
the
daylight
we
all
came
to
look
at
the
wonder
marveling
much
and
saying
surely
these
must
be
the
last
but
every
day
for
three
days
the
dead
vine
bloomed
and
even
a
week
after
when
every
leaf
was
dry
and
brown
and
so
thin
you
could
see
through
it
one
last
bud
dwarfed
weak
a
very
baby
of
a
blossom
but
still
white
and
delicate
with
five
purple
flecks
like
those
on
the
live
vine
beside
it
opened
and
waved
at
the
stars
and
waited
for
the
early
sun
over
death
and
decay
the
dominant
idea
smiled
the
vine
was
in
the
world
to
bloom
to
bear
white
trumpet
blossoms
dashed
with
purple
and
it
held
its
will
beyond
death
our
modern
teaching
is
that
ideas
are
but
attendant
phenomena
impotent
to
determine
the
actions
or
relations
of
life
as
the
image
in
the
glass
which
should
say
to
the
body
it
reflects
shall
shape
in
truth
we
know
that
directly
the
body
goes
from
before
the
mirror
the
transient
image
is
nothingness
but
the
real
body
has
its
being
to
live
and
will
live
it
heedless
of
vanished
phantoms
of
itself
in
response
to
the
pressure
of
things
without
it
it
is
thus
that
the
materialist
conception
of
history
the
modern
socialists
and
a
positive
majority
of
anarchists
would
have
us
look
upon
the
world
of
ideas
shifting
unreal
reflections
having
naught
to
do
in
the
determination
of
man
life
but
so
many
mirror
appearances
of
certain
material
relations
wholly
powerless
to
act
upon
the
course
of
material
things
mind
to
them
is
in
itself
a
blank
mirror
though
in
fact
never
wholly
blank
because
always
facing
the
reality
of
the
material
and
bound
to
reflect
some
shadow
i
am
somebody
somebody
else
if
the
scenes
have
shifted
my
ego
is
a
gibbering
phantom
pirouetting
in
the
glass
gesticulating
transforming
hourly
or
momentarily
gleaming
with
the
phosphor
light
of
a
deceptive
unreality
melting
like
the
mist
upon
the
hills
rocks
fields
woods
streams
houses
goods
flesh
blood
bone
sinew
these
are
realities
with
definite
parts
to
play
with
essential
characters
that
abide
under
all
changes
but
my
ego
does
not
abide
it
is
manufactured
afresh
with
every
change
of
these
i
think
this
unqualified
determinism
of
the
material
is
a
great
and
lamentable
error
in
our
modern
progressive
movement
and
while
i
believe
it
was
a
wholesome
antidote
to
the
blunder
of
middle
age
theology
viz
that
mind
was
an
utterly
irresponsible
entity
making
laws
of
its
own
after
the
manner
of
an
absolute
emperor
without
logic
sequence
or
relation
ruler
over
matter
and
its
own
supreme
determinant
not
excepting
god
who
was
himself
the
same
sort
of
a
mind
writ
large
while
i
do
believe
that
the
modern
reconception
of
materialism
has
done
a
wholesome
thing
in
pricking
the
bubble
of
such
conceit
and
restoring
man
and
his
soul
to
its
place
in
nature
i
nevertheless
believe
that
to
this
also
there
is
a
limit
and
that
the
absolute
sway
of
matter
is
quite
as
mischievous
an
error
as
the
unrelated
nature
of
mind
even
that
in
its
direct
action
upon
personal
conduct
it
has
the
more
ill
effect
of
the
two
for
if
the
doctrine
of
has
raised
up
fanatics
and
persecutors
who
assuming
that
men
may
be
good
under
all
conditions
if
they
merely
wish
to
be
so
have
sought
to
persuade
other
men
wills
with
threats
fines
imprisonments
torture
the
spike
the
wheel
the
axe
the
fagot
in
order
to
make
them
good
and
save
them
against
their
obdurate
wills
if
the
doctrine
of
spiritualism
the
soul
supreme
has
done
this
the
doctrine
of
materialistic
determinism
has
produced
shifting
worthless
parasitical
characters
who
are
now
and
at
some
other
time
and
anything
and
nothing
upon
principle
my
conditions
have
made
me
so
they
cry
and
there
is
no
more
to
be
said
poor
how
could
they
help
it
to
be
sure
the
influence
of
such
a
character
rarely
reaches
so
far
as
that
of
the
principled
persecutor
but
for
every
one
of
the
latter
there
are
a
hundred
of
these
easy
doughy
characters
who
will
fit
any
baking
tin
to
whom
determinist
appeals
so
the
balance
of
evil
between
the
two
doctrines
is
maintained
what
we
need
is
a
true
appraisement
of
the
power
and
rôle
of
the
idea
i
do
not
think
i
am
able
to
give
such
a
true
appraisement
i
do
not
think
that
any
one
even
greater
intellects
than
mine
will
be
able
to
do
it
for
a
long
time
to
come
but
i
am
at
least
able
to
suggest
it
to
show
its
necessity
to
give
a
rude
approximation
of
it
and
first
against
the
accepted
formula
of
modern
materialism
men
are
what
circumstances
make
them
i
set
the
opposing
declaration
circumstances
are
what
men
make
them
and
i
contend
that
both
these
things
are
true
up
to
the
point
where
the
combating
powers
are
equalized
or
one
is
overthrown
in
other
words
my
conception
of
mind
or
character
is
not
that
it
is
a
powerless
reflection
of
a
momentary
condition
of
stuff
and
form
but
an
active
modifying
agent
reacting
on
its
environment
and
transforming
circumstances
sometimes
greatly
sometimes
though
not
often
entirely
all
over
the
kingdom
of
life
i
have
said
one
may
see
dominant
ideas
working
if
one
but
trains
his
eyes
to
look
for
them
and
recognize
them
in
the
human
world
there
have
been
many
dominant
ideas
i
can
not
conceive
that
ever
at
any
time
the
struggle
of
the
body
before
dissolution
can
have
been
aught
but
agony
if
the
reasoning
that
insecurity
of
conditions
the
expectation
of
suffering
are
circumstances
which
make
the
soul
of
man
uneasy
shrinking
timid
what
answer
will
you
give
to
the
challenge
of
old
ragnar
lodbrog
to
that
triumphant
hurled
out
not
by
one
cast
to
his
death
in
the
heat
of
battle
but
under
slow
prison
torture
bitten
by
serpents
and
yet
singing
the
goddesses
of
death
invite
me
away
now
end
i
my
song
the
hours
of
my
life
are
run
out
i
shall
smile
when
i
die
nor
can
it
be
said
that
this
is
an
exceptional
instance
not
to
be
accounted
for
by
the
usual
operation
of
general
law
for
old
king
lodbrog
the
skalder
did
only
what
his
fathers
did
and
his
sons
and
his
friends
and
his
enemies
through
long
generations
they
set
the
force
of
a
dominant
idea
the
idea
of
the
superascendant
ego
against
the
force
of
torture
and
of
death
ending
life
as
they
wished
to
end
it
with
a
smile
on
their
lips
but
a
few
years
ago
did
we
not
read
how
the
helpless
kaffirs
victimized
by
the
english
for
the
contumacy
of
the
boers
having
been
forced
to
dig
the
trenches
wherein
for
pleasant
sport
they
were
to
be
shot
were
lined
up
on
the
edge
and
seeing
death
facing
them
began
to
chant
barbaric
strains
of
triumph
smiling
as
they
fell
let
us
admit
that
such
exultant
defiance
was
owing
to
ignorance
to
primitive
beliefs
in
gods
and
hereafters
but
let
us
admit
also
that
it
shows
the
power
of
an
idea
dominant
everywhere
in
the
shells
of
dead
societies
as
in
the
shells
of
the
we
shall
see
the
force
of
purposive
action
of
intent
holding
its
purpose
against
obstacles
i
think
there
is
no
one
in
the
world
who
can
look
upon
the
steadfast
face
of
an
egyptian
carving
or
read
a
description
of
egypt
monuments
or
gaze
upon
the
mummied
clay
of
its
old
dead
men
without
feeling
that
the
dominant
idea
of
that
people
in
that
age
was
to
be
enduring
and
to
work
enduring
things
with
the
immobility
of
their
great
still
sky
upon
them
and
the
stare
of
the
desert
in
them
one
must
feel
that
whatever
other
ideas
animated
them
and
expressed
themselves
in
their
lives
this
was
the
dominant
idea
which
must
remain
no
matter
at
what
cost
even
if
it
were
to
break
the
everlasting
hills
an
idea
which
made
the
live
humanity
beneath
it
born
and
nurtured
in
the
coffins
of
caste
groan
and
writhe
and
gnaw
its
bandages
till
in
the
fullness
of
time
it
passed
away
and
still
the
granite
mould
of
it
stares
with
empty
eyes
out
across
the
world
the
stern
old
memory
of
the
i
think
no
one
can
look
upon
the
marbles
wherein
greek
genius
wrought
the
figuring
of
its
soul
without
feeling
an
apprehension
that
the
things
are
going
to
leap
and
fly
that
in
a
moment
one
is
like
to
be
set
upon
by
heroes
with
spears
in
their
hands
by
serpents
that
will
coil
around
him
to
be
trodden
by
horses
that
may
trample
and
flee
to
be
smitten
by
these
gods
that
have
as
little
of
the
idea
of
stone
in
them
as
a
one
instant
poised
upon
a
petal
edge
i
think
no
one
can
look
upon
them
without
realizing
at
once
that
those
figures
came
out
of
the
boil
of
life
they
seem
like
rising
bubbles
about
to
float
into
the
air
but
beneath
them
other
bubbles
rising
and
others
and
others
there
will
be
no
end
of
it
when
one
eyes
are
upon
one
group
one
feels
that
behind
one
perhaps
a
figure
is
uptoeing
to
seize
the
darts
of
the
air
and
hurl
them
on
one
head
one
must
keep
whirling
to
face
the
miracle
that
appears
about
to
be
wrought
stone
leaping
and
this
though
nearly
every
one
is
minus
some
of
the
glory
the
old
greek
wrought
into
it
so
long
ago
even
the
broken
stumps
of
arms
and
legs
live
and
the
dominant
idea
is
activity
and
the
beauty
and
strength
of
it
change
swift
change
the
making
of
things
and
the
casting
of
them
away
as
children
cast
away
their
toys
not
interested
that
these
shall
endure
so
that
they
themselves
realize
incessant
activity
full
of
creative
power
what
matter
if
the
creature
perished
so
there
was
an
endless
procession
of
changing
shapes
in
their
schools
their
philosophies
their
dramas
their
poems
till
at
last
it
wore
itself
to
death
and
the
marvel
passed
away
from
the
world
but
still
their
marbles
live
to
show
what
manner
of
thoughts
dominated
them
and
if
we
wish
to
know
what
ruled
the
lives
of
men
when
the
mediæval
period
had
had
time
to
ripen
it
one
has
only
at
this
day
to
stray
into
some
quaint
english
village
where
a
strong
old
towered
church
yet
stands
in
the
midst
of
little
cottages
like
a
brooding
surrounded
by
her
chickens
everywhere
the
greatening
of
god
and
the
lessening
of
man
the
church
so
looming
the
home
so
little
the
search
for
the
spirit
for
the
thing
not
the
poor
endurance
of
granite
which
in
the
ages
crumbles
but
the
eternal
the
eternal
and
contempt
for
the
body
which
perishes
manifest
in
studied
uncleanliness
in
mortifications
of
the
flesh
as
if
the
spirit
should
have
spat
its
scorn
upon
it
such
was
the
dominant
idea
of
that
middle
age
which
has
been
too
much
cursed
by
modernists
for
the
men
who
built
the
castles
and
the
cathedrals
were
men
of
mighty
works
though
they
made
no
books
and
though
their
souls
spread
crippled
wings
because
of
their
very
endeavors
to
soar
too
high
the
spirit
of
voluntary
subordination
for
the
accomplishment
of
a
great
work
which
proclaimed
the
aspiration
of
the
common
soul
that
was
the
spirit
wrought
into
the
cathedral
stones
and
it
is
not
wholly
to
be
condemned
in
waking
dream
when
the
of
swim
before
the
vision
one
sees
the
soul
an
thing
with
dragon
wings
and
a
great
dark
tense
face
strained
sunward
with
blind
eyes
if
now
we
look
around
us
to
see
what
idea
dominates
our
own
civilization
i
do
not
know
that
it
is
even
as
attractive
as
this
piteous
monster
of
the
old
darkness
the
relativity
of
things
has
altered
man
has
risen
and
god
has
descended
the
modern
village
has
better
homes
and
less
pretentious
churches
also
the
conception
of
dirt
and
disease
as
afflictions
the
patient
suffering
of
which
is
a
meet
offering
to
win
god
pardon
has
given
place
to
the
emphatic
promulgation
of
cleanliness
we
have
public
school
nurses
notifying
parents
that
pediculosis
capitis
is
a
very
contagious
and
unpleasant
disease
we
have
cancer
associations
gathering
up
such
cancers
as
have
attached
themselves
to
impecunious
persons
and
carefully
experimenting
with
a
view
to
cleaning
them
out
of
the
human
race
we
have
tuberculosis
societies
attempting
the
herculean
labor
of
clearing
the
augean
stables
of
our
modern
factories
of
the
deadly
bacillus
and
they
have
got
as
far
as
spittoons
with
water
in
them
in
some
factories
and
others
and
others
and
others
which
while
not
yet
overwhelmingly
successful
in
their
avowed
purposes
are
evidence
sufficient
that
humanity
no
longer
seeks
dirt
as
a
means
of
grace
we
laugh
at
those
old
superstitions
and
talk
much
about
exact
experimental
knowledge
we
endeavor
to
galvanize
the
greek
corpse
and
pretend
that
we
enjoy
physical
culture
we
dabble
in
many
things
but
the
one
great
real
idea
of
our
age
not
copied
from
any
other
not
pretended
not
raised
to
life
by
any
conjuration
is
the
much
making
of
things
not
the
making
of
beautiful
things
not
the
joy
of
spending
living
energy
in
creative
work
rather
the
shameless
merciless
driving
and
wasting
and
draining
of
the
last
bit
of
energy
only
to
produce
heaps
and
heaps
of
things
things
ugly
things
harmful
things
useless
and
at
the
best
largely
unnecessary
to
what
end
are
they
produced
mostly
the
producer
does
not
know
still
less
does
he
care
but
he
is
possessed
with
the
idea
that
he
do
it
every
one
is
doing
it
and
every
year
the
making
of
things
goes
on
more
and
faster
there
are
mountain
ranges
of
things
made
and
making
and
still
men
go
about
desperately
seeking
to
increase
the
list
of
created
things
to
start
fresh
heaps
and
to
add
to
the
existing
heaps
and
with
what
agony
of
body
under
what
stress
and
strain
of
danger
and
fear
of
danger
with
what
mutilations
and
maimings
and
lamings
they
struggle
on
dashing
themselves
out
against
these
rocks
of
wealth
verily
if
the
vision
of
the
mediæval
soul
is
painful
in
its
blind
staring
and
pathetic
striving
grotesque
in
its
senseless
tortures
the
soul
of
the
modern
is
most
amazing
with
its
restless
nervous
eyes
ever
searching
the
corners
of
the
universe
its
restless
nervous
hands
ever
reaching
and
grasping
for
some
useless
toil
and
certainly
the
presence
of
things
in
abundance
things
empty
and
things
vulgar
and
things
absurd
as
well
as
things
convenient
and
useful
has
produced
the
desire
for
the
possession
of
things
the
exaltation
of
the
possession
of
things
go
through
the
business
street
of
any
city
where
the
tilted
edges
of
the
strata
of
things
are
exposed
to
gaze
and
look
at
the
faces
of
the
people
as
they
pass
not
at
the
hungry
and
smitten
ones
who
fringe
the
sidewalks
and
plaint
dolefully
for
alms
but
at
the
crowd
and
see
what
idea
is
written
on
their
faces
on
those
of
the
women
from
the
ladies
of
the
to
the
shop
girls
out
of
the
factory
there
is
a
sickening
vanity
a
consciousness
of
their
clothes
as
of
some
jackdaw
in
borrowed
feathers
look
for
the
pride
and
glory
of
the
free
strong
beautiful
body
and
powerful
you
will
not
see
it
you
will
see
mincing
steps
bodies
tilted
to
show
the
cut
of
a
skirt
simpering
smirking
faces
with
eyes
cast
about
seeking
admiration
for
the
gigantic
bow
of
ribbon
in
the
overdressed
hair
in
the
caustic
words
of
an
acquaintance
to
whom
i
once
said
as
we
walked
look
at
the
amount
of
vanity
on
all
these
women
faces
no
look
at
the
little
bit
of
womanhood
showing
out
of
all
that
vanity
and
on
the
faces
of
the
men
coarseness
coarse
desires
for
coarse
things
and
lots
of
them
the
stamp
is
set
so
unmistakably
that
the
wayfarer
though
a
fool
need
not
err
therein
even
the
frightful
anxiety
and
restlessness
begotten
of
the
creation
of
all
this
is
less
distasteful
than
the
abominable
expression
of
lust
for
the
things
created
such
is
the
dominant
idea
of
the
western
world
at
least
in
these
our
days
you
may
see
it
wherever
you
look
impressed
plainly
on
things
and
on
men
very
likely
if
you
look
in
the
glass
you
will
see
it
there
and
if
some
archæologist
of
a
long
future
shall
some
day
unbury
the
bones
of
our
civilization
where
ashes
or
flood
shall
have
entombed
it
he
will
see
this
frightful
idea
stamped
on
the
factory
walls
he
shall
uncover
with
their
rows
and
rows
of
square
lightholes
their
tons
upon
tons
of
toothed
steel
grinning
out
of
the
skull
of
this
our
life
its
acres
of
silk
and
velvet
its
square
miles
of
tinsel
and
shoddy
no
glorious
marbles
of
nymphs
and
fawns
whose
dead
images
are
yet
so
sweet
that
one
might
wish
to
kiss
them
still
no
majestic
figures
of
winged
horses
with
men
faces
and
lions
paws
casting
their
colossal
symbolism
in
a
mighty
spell
forward
upon
time
as
those
old
stone
chimeras
of
babylon
yet
do
but
meaningless
iron
giants
of
wheels
and
teeth
whose
secret
is
forgotten
but
whose
business
was
to
grind
men
up
and
spit
them
out
as
housefuls
of
woven
stuffs
bazaars
of
trash
wherethrough
other
men
might
wade
the
statues
he
shall
find
will
bear
no
trace
of
mythic
dream
or
mystic
symbol
they
will
be
statues
of
merchants
and
and
militiamen
in
tailored
coats
and
pantaloons
and
proper
hats
and
shoes
but
the
dominant
idea
of
the
age
and
land
does
not
necessarily
mean
the
dominant
idea
of
any
single
life
i
doubt
not
that
in
those
long
gone
days
far
away
by
the
banks
of
the
still
nile
in
the
abiding
shadow
of
the
pyramids
under
the
heavy
burden
of
other
men
stolidity
there
went
to
and
fro
restless
active
rebel
souls
who
hated
all
that
the
ancient
society
stood
for
and
with
burning
hearts
sought
to
overthrow
it
i
am
sure
that
in
the
midst
of
all
the
agile
greek
intellect
created
there
were
those
who
went
about
with
downbent
eyes
caring
nothing
for
it
all
seeking
some
higher
revelation
willing
to
abandon
the
joys
of
life
so
that
they
drew
near
to
some
distant
unknown
perfection
their
fellows
knew
not
of
i
am
certain
that
in
the
dark
ages
when
most
men
prayed
and
cowered
and
beat
and
bruised
themselves
and
sought
afflictions
like
that
teresa
who
said
let
me
suffer
or
die
there
were
some
many
who
looked
on
the
world
as
a
chance
jest
who
despised
or
pitied
their
ignorant
comrades
and
tried
to
compel
the
answers
of
the
universe
to
their
questionings
by
the
patient
quiet
searching
which
came
to
be
modern
science
i
am
sure
there
were
hundreds
thousands
of
them
of
whom
we
have
never
heard
and
now
though
the
society
about
us
is
dominated
by
and
will
stand
so
marked
for
all
time
that
is
no
reason
any
single
soul
should
be
because
the
one
thing
seemingly
worth
doing
to
my
neighbor
to
all
my
neighbors
is
to
pursue
dollars
that
is
no
reason
i
should
pursue
dollars
because
my
neighbors
conceive
they
need
an
inordinate
heap
of
carpets
furniture
clocks
china
glass
tapestries
mirrors
clothes
jewels
and
servants
to
care
for
them
and
detectives
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
servants
judges
to
try
the
thieves
and
politicians
to
appoint
the
judges
jails
to
punish
the
culprits
and
wardens
to
watch
in
the
jails
and
tax
collectors
to
gather
support
for
the
wardens
and
fees
for
the
tax
collectors
and
strong
houses
to
hold
the
fees
so
that
none
but
the
guardians
thereof
can
make
off
with
them
and
therefore
to
keep
this
host
of
parasites
need
other
men
to
work
for
them
and
make
the
fees
because
my
neighbors
want
all
this
is
that
any
reason
i
should
devote
myself
to
such
a
barren
folly
and
bow
my
neck
to
serve
to
keep
up
the
gaudy
show
must
we
because
the
middle
age
was
dark
and
blind
and
brutal
throw
away
the
one
good
thing
it
wrought
into
the
fibre
of
man
that
the
inside
of
a
human
being
was
worth
more
than
the
outside
that
to
conceive
a
higher
thing
than
oneself
and
live
toward
that
is
the
only
way
of
living
worthily
the
goal
strived
for
should
and
must
be
a
very
different
one
from
that
which
led
the
mediæval
fanatics
to
despise
the
body
and
belabor
it
with
hourly
crucifixions
but
one
can
recognize
the
claims
and
the
importance
of
the
body
without
therefore
sacrificing
truth
honor
simplicity
and
faith
to
the
vulgar
gauds
of
whose
very
decorations
debase
the
thing
they
might
be
supposed
to
exalt
i
have
said
before
that
the
doctrine
that
men
are
nothing
and
circumstances
all
has
been
and
is
the
bane
of
our
modern
social
reform
movements
our
youth
themselves
animated
by
the
spirit
of
the
old
teachers
who
believed
in
the
supremacy
of
ideas
even
in
the
very
hour
of
throwing
away
that
teaching
look
with
burning
eyes
to
the
social
east
and
believe
that
wonders
of
revolution
are
soon
to
be
accomplished
in
their
enthusiasm
they
foreread
the
gospel
of
circumstances
to
mean
that
very
soon
the
pressure
of
material
development
must
break
down
the
social
system
they
give
the
rotten
thing
but
a
few
years
to
last
and
then
they
themselves
shall
witness
the
transformation
partake
in
its
joys
the
few
years
pass
away
and
nothing
happens
enthusiasm
cools
behold
these
same
idealists
then
successful
business
men
professionals
property
owners
money
lenders
creeping
into
the
social
ranks
they
once
despised
pitifully
contemptibly
at
the
skirts
of
some
impecunious
personage
to
whom
they
have
lent
money
or
done
some
professional
service
gratis
behold
them
lying
cheating
tricking
flattering
buying
and
selling
themselves
for
any
frippery
any
cheap
little
pretense
the
dominant
social
idea
has
seized
them
their
lives
are
swallowed
up
in
it
and
when
you
ask
the
reason
why
they
tell
you
that
circumstances
compelled
them
so
to
do
if
you
quote
their
lies
to
them
they
smile
with
calm
complacency
assure
you
that
when
circumstances
demand
lies
lies
are
a
great
deal
better
than
truth
that
tricks
are
sometimes
more
effective
than
honest
dealing
that
flattering
and
duping
do
not
matter
if
the
end
to
be
attained
is
desirable
and
that
under
existing
circumstances
life
is
possible
without
all
this
that
it
is
going
to
be
possible
whenever
circumstances
have
made
easier
than
lying
but
till
then
a
man
must
look
out
for
himself
by
all
means
and
so
the
cancer
goes
on
rotting
away
the
moral
fibre
and
the
man
becomes
a
lump
a
squash
a
piece
of
slippery
slime
taking
all
shapes
and
losing
all
shapes
according
to
what
particular
hole
or
corner
he
wishes
to
glide
into
a
disgusting
embodiment
of
the
moral
bankruptcy
begotten
by
had
he
been
dominated
by
a
less
material
conception
of
life
had
his
will
not
been
rotted
by
the
intellectual
reasoning
of
it
out
of
its
existence
by
its
acceptance
of
its
own
nothingness
the
unselfish
aspirations
of
his
earlier
years
would
have
grown
and
strengthened
by
exercise
and
habit
and
his
protest
against
the
time
might
have
been
enduringly
written
and
to
some
purpose
will
it
be
said
that
the
pilgrim
fathers
did
not
hew
out
of
the
new
england
ice
and
granite
the
idea
which
gathered
them
together
out
of
their
scattered
and
obscure
english
villages
and
drove
them
in
their
frail
ships
over
the
atlantic
in
midwinter
to
cut
their
way
against
all
opposing
forces
were
they
not
common
men
subject
to
the
operation
of
common
law
will
it
be
said
that
circumstances
aided
them
when
death
disease
hunger
and
cold
had
done
their
worst
not
one
of
those
remaining
was
willing
by
an
to
return
to
material
comfort
and
the
possibility
of
long
days
had
our
modern
social
revolutionists
the
vigorous
and
undaunted
conception
of
their
own
powers
that
these
had
our
social
movements
would
not
be
such
pitiful
abortions
even
before
the
outward
flecks
appear
give
a
labor
leader
a
political
job
and
the
system
becomes
all
right
laugh
our
enemies
and
they
point
mockingly
to
terence
powderly
and
his
like
and
they
quote
john
burns
who
as
soon
as
went
into
parliament
declared
the
time
of
the
agitator
is
past
the
time
of
the
legislator
has
come
let
an
anarchist
marry
an
heiress
and
the
country
is
safe
they
sneer
and
they
have
the
right
to
sneer
but
would
they
have
that
right
could
they
have
it
if
our
lives
were
not
in
the
first
instance
dominated
by
more
insistent
desires
than
those
we
would
fain
have
others
think
we
hold
most
dear
it
is
the
old
story
aim
at
the
stars
and
you
may
hit
the
top
of
the
gatepost
but
aim
at
the
ground
and
you
will
hit
the
ground
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
any
one
will
attain
to
the
full
realization
of
what
he
purposes
even
when
those
purposes
do
not
involve
united
action
with
others
he
fall
short
he
will
in
some
measure
be
overcome
by
contending
or
inert
opposition
but
something
he
will
attain
if
he
continues
to
aim
high
what
then
would
i
have
you
ask
i
would
have
men
invest
themselves
with
the
dignity
of
an
aim
higher
than
the
chase
for
wealth
choose
a
thing
to
do
in
life
outside
of
the
making
of
things
and
keep
it
in
mind
not
for
a
day
nor
a
year
but
for
a
lifetime
and
then
keep
faith
with
themselves
not
be
a
professing
this
and
that
and
easily
reading
oneself
out
of
both
whenever
it
becomes
convenient
not
advocating
a
thing
and
kissing
its
enemies
sleeve
with
that
weak
coward
cry
in
the
mouth
circumstances
make
me
take
a
good
look
into
yourself
and
if
you
love
things
and
the
power
and
the
plenitude
of
things
better
than
you
love
your
own
dignity
human
dignity
oh
say
so
say
so
say
it
to
yourself
and
abide
by
it
but
do
not
blow
hot
and
cold
in
one
breath
do
not
try
to
be
a
social
reformer
and
a
respected
possessor
of
things
at
the
same
time
do
not
preach
the
straight
and
narrow
way
while
going
joyously
upon
the
wide
one
the
wide
or
do
not
preach
at
all
but
do
not
fool
yourself
by
saying
you
would
like
to
help
usher
in
a
free
society
but
you
can
not
sacrifice
an
armchair
for
it
say
honestly
i
love
armchairs
better
than
free
men
and
pursue
them
because
i
choose
not
because
circumstances
make
me
i
love
hats
large
large
hats
with
many
feathers
and
great
bows
and
i
would
rather
have
those
hats
than
trouble
myself
about
social
dreams
that
will
never
be
accomplished
in
my
day
the
world
worships
hats
and
i
wish
to
worship
with
them
but
if
you
choose
the
liberty
and
pride
and
strength
of
the
single
soul
and
the
free
fraternization
of
men
as
the
purpose
which
your
life
is
to
make
manifest
then
do
not
sell
it
for
tinsel
think
that
your
soul
is
strong
and
will
hold
its
way
and
slowly
through
bitter
struggle
perhaps
the
strength
will
grow
and
the
foregoing
of
possessions
for
which
others
barter
the
last
possibility
of
freedom
will
become
easy
at
the
end
of
life
you
may
close
your
eyes
saying
i
have
not
been
dominated
by
the
dominant
idea
of
my
age
i
have
chosen
mine
own
allegiance
and
served
it
i
have
proved
by
a
lifetime
that
there
is
that
in
man
which
saves
him
from
the
absolute
tyranny
of
circumstance
which
in
the
end
conquers
and
remoulds
circumstance
the
immortal
fire
of
individual
will
which
is
the
salvation
of
the
future
let
us
have
men
men
who
will
say
a
word
to
their
souls
and
keep
it
keep
it
not
when
it
is
easy
but
keep
it
when
it
is
hard
keep
it
when
the
storm
roars
and
there
is
a
sky
and
blue
thunder
before
and
one
eyes
are
blinded
and
one
ears
deafened
with
the
war
of
opposing
things
and
keep
it
under
the
long
leaden
sky
and
the
gray
dreariness
that
never
lifts
hold
unto
the
last
that
is
what
it
means
to
have
a
dominant
idea
where
the
same
idea
has
been
worked
out
by
a
whole
and
unmake
circumstance
anarchism
there
are
two
spirits
abroad
in
the
world
the
spirit
of
caution
the
spirit
of
dare
the
spirit
of
quiescence
the
spirit
of
unrest
the
spirit
of
immobility
the
spirit
of
change
the
spirit
of
the
spirit
of
the
spirit
of
the
slow
and
steady
builder
careful
of
its
labors
loath
to
part
with
any
of
its
achievements
wishful
to
keep
and
unable
to
discriminate
between
what
is
worth
keeping
and
what
is
better
cast
aside
and
the
spirit
of
the
inspirational
destroyer
fertile
in
creative
fancies
volatile
careless
in
its
luxuriance
of
effort
inclined
to
cast
away
the
good
together
with
the
bad
society
is
a
quivering
balance
eternally
struck
afresh
between
these
two
those
who
look
upon
man
as
most
anarchists
do
as
a
link
in
the
chain
of
evolution
see
in
these
two
social
tendencies
the
sum
of
the
tendencies
of
individual
men
which
in
common
with
the
tendencies
of
all
organic
life
are
the
result
of
the
action
and
counteraction
of
inheritance
and
adaptation
inheritance
continually
tending
to
repeat
what
has
been
long
long
after
it
is
outgrown
adaptation
continually
tending
to
break
down
forms
the
same
tendencies
under
other
names
are
observed
in
the
inorganic
world
as
well
and
anyone
who
is
possessed
by
the
modern
scientific
mania
for
monism
can
easily
follow
out
the
line
to
the
vanishing
point
of
human
knowledge
there
has
been
in
fact
a
strong
inclination
to
do
this
among
a
portion
of
the
more
educated
anarchists
who
having
been
working
men
first
and
anarchists
by
reason
of
their
instinctive
hatred
to
the
boss
later
became
students
and
swept
away
by
their
undigested
science
immediately
conceived
that
it
was
necessary
to
fit
their
anarchism
to
the
revelations
of
the
microscope
else
the
theory
might
as
well
be
given
up
i
remember
with
considerable
amusement
a
heated
discussion
some
five
or
six
years
since
wherein
doctors
and
embryo
doctors
sought
for
a
justification
of
anarchism
in
the
development
of
the
amoeba
while
a
fledgling
engineer
searched
for
it
in
mathematical
quantities
myself
at
one
time
asserted
very
stoutly
that
no
one
could
be
an
anarchist
and
believe
in
god
at
the
same
time
others
assert
as
stoutly
that
one
can
not
accept
the
spiritualist
philosophy
and
be
an
anarchist
at
present
i
hold
with
james
the
most
learned
of
american
anarchists
that
one
metaphysical
system
has
very
little
to
do
with
the
matter
the
chain
of
reasoning
which
once
appeared
so
conclusive
to
me
namely
that
anarchism
being
a
denial
of
authority
over
the
individual
could
not
with
a
belief
in
a
supreme
ruler
of
the
universe
is
contradicted
in
the
case
of
leo
tolstoy
who
comes
to
the
conclusion
that
none
has
a
right
to
rule
another
just
because
of
his
belief
in
god
just
because
he
believes
that
all
are
equal
children
of
one
father
and
therefore
none
has
a
right
to
rule
the
other
i
speak
of
him
because
he
is
a
familiar
and
notable
personage
but
there
have
frequently
been
instances
where
the
same
idea
has
been
worked
out
by
a
whole
sect
of
believers
especially
in
the
earlier
and
persecuted
stages
of
their
development
it
no
longer
seems
necessary
to
me
therefore
that
one
should
base
his
anarchism
upon
any
particular
world
conception
it
is
a
theory
of
the
relations
due
to
man
and
comes
as
an
offered
solution
to
the
societary
problems
arising
from
the
existence
of
these
two
tendencies
of
which
i
have
spoken
no
matter
where
those
tendencies
come
from
all
alike
recognize
them
as
existent
and
however
interesting
the
speculation
however
fascinating
to
lose
oneself
back
back
in
the
molecular
wherein
the
figure
of
man
is
seen
merely
as
a
denser
fiercer
group
a
livelier
storm
centre
moving
among
others
impinging
upon
others
but
nowhere
separate
nowhere
exempt
from
the
same
necessity
that
acts
upon
all
other
centers
of
force
it
is
by
no
means
necessary
in
order
to
reason
oneself
into
anarchism
sufficient
are
a
good
observant
eye
and
a
reasonably
reflecting
brain
for
anyone
lettered
or
unlettered
to
recognize
the
desirability
of
anarchistic
aims
this
is
not
to
say
that
increased
knowledge
will
not
confirm
and
expand
one
application
of
this
fundamental
concept
the
beauty
of
truth
is
that
at
every
new
discovery
of
fact
we
find
how
much
wider
and
deeper
it
is
than
we
at
first
thought
it
but
it
means
that
first
of
all
anarchism
is
concerned
with
present
conditions
and
with
the
very
plain
and
common
people
and
is
by
no
means
a
complex
or
difficult
proposition
anarchism
alone
apart
from
any
proposed
economic
reform
is
just
the
latest
reply
out
of
many
the
past
has
given
to
that
daring
breakaway
volatile
changeful
spirit
which
is
never
content
the
society
of
which
we
are
part
puts
certain
oppressions
upon
us
oppressions
which
have
arisen
out
of
the
very
changes
accomplished
by
this
same
spirit
combined
with
the
hard
and
fast
lines
of
old
habits
acquired
and
fixed
before
the
changes
were
thought
of
machinery
which
as
our
socialistic
comrades
continually
emphasize
has
wrought
a
revolution
in
industry
is
the
creation
of
the
dare
spirit
it
has
fought
its
way
against
ancient
customs
privilege
and
cowardice
at
every
step
as
the
history
of
any
invention
would
show
if
traced
backward
through
all
its
transformations
and
what
is
the
result
of
it
that
a
system
of
working
altogether
appropriate
to
hand
production
and
capable
of
generating
no
great
oppressions
while
industry
remained
in
that
state
has
been
stretched
strained
to
fit
production
in
mass
till
we
are
reaching
the
bursting
point
once
more
the
spirit
of
dare
must
assert
itself
claim
new
freedoms
since
the
old
ones
are
rendered
null
and
void
by
the
present
methods
of
production
to
speak
in
detail
in
the
old
days
of
master
and
man
not
so
old
but
what
many
of
the
older
workingmen
can
recall
the
conditions
the
workshop
was
a
fairly
place
where
employer
and
employed
worked
together
knew
no
class
feelings
chummed
it
out
of
hours
as
a
rule
were
not
obliged
to
rush
and
when
they
were
relied
upon
the
principle
of
common
interest
and
friendship
not
upon
a
power
for
overtime
assistance
the
proportional
profit
on
each
labor
may
even
have
been
in
general
higher
but
the
total
amount
possible
to
be
undertaken
by
one
employer
was
relatively
so
small
that
no
tremendous
aggregations
of
wealth
could
arise
to
be
an
employer
gave
no
man
power
over
another
incomings
and
outgoings
neither
upon
his
speech
while
at
work
nor
to
force
him
beyond
endurance
when
busy
nor
to
subject
him
to
fines
and
tributes
for
undesired
things
such
as
dirty
spittoons
cups
of
undrinkable
tea
and
the
like
nor
to
the
unmentionable
indecencies
of
the
large
factory
the
individuality
of
the
workman
was
a
plainly
recognized
quantity
his
life
was
his
own
he
could
not
be
locked
in
and
driven
to
death
like
a
horse
for
the
good
of
the
general
public
and
the
paramount
importance
of
society
with
the
application
of
and
the
development
of
machinery
came
these
large
groupings
of
workers
this
subdivision
of
work
which
has
made
of
the
employer
a
man
apart
having
interests
hostile
to
those
of
his
employes
living
in
another
circle
altogether
knowing
nothing
of
them
but
as
so
many
units
of
power
to
be
reckoned
with
as
he
does
his
machines
for
the
most
part
despising
them
at
his
very
best
regarding
them
as
dependents
whom
he
is
bound
in
some
respects
to
care
for
as
a
humane
man
cares
for
an
old
horse
he
can
not
use
such
is
his
relation
to
his
employes
while
to
the
general
public
he
becomes
simply
an
immense
with
tentacles
reaching
everywhere
each
tiny
mouth
producing
no
great
effect
but
in
aggregate
drawing
up
such
a
body
of
wealth
as
makes
any
declaration
of
equality
or
freedom
between
him
and
the
worker
a
thing
to
laugh
at
the
time
is
come
therefore
when
the
spirit
of
dare
calls
loud
through
every
factory
and
workshop
for
a
change
in
the
relations
of
master
and
man
there
must
be
some
arrangement
possible
which
will
preserve
the
benefits
of
the
new
production
and
at
the
same
time
restore
the
individual
dignity
of
the
worker
give
back
the
bold
independence
of
the
old
master
of
his
trade
together
with
such
added
freedoms
as
may
properly
accrue
to
him
as
his
special
advantage
from
society
material
developments
this
is
the
particular
message
of
anarchism
to
the
worker
it
is
not
an
economic
system
it
does
not
come
to
you
with
detailed
plans
of
how
you
the
workers
are
to
conduct
industry
nor
systemized
methods
of
exchange
nor
careful
paper
organizations
of
the
administration
of
things
it
simply
calls
upon
the
spirit
of
individuality
to
rise
up
from
its
abasement
and
hold
itself
paramount
in
no
matter
what
economic
reorganization
shall
come
about
be
men
first
of
all
not
held
in
slavery
by
the
things
you
make
let
your
gospel
be
things
for
men
not
men
for
things
socialism
economically
considered
is
a
positive
proposition
for
such
reorganization
it
is
an
attempt
in
the
main
to
grasp
at
those
great
new
material
gains
which
have
been
the
special
creation
of
the
last
forty
or
fifty
years
it
has
not
so
much
in
view
the
reclamation
and
further
assertion
of
the
personality
of
the
worker
as
it
has
a
just
distribution
of
products
now
it
is
perfectly
apparent
that
anarchy
having
to
do
almost
entirely
with
the
relations
of
men
in
their
thoughts
and
feelings
and
not
with
the
positive
organization
of
production
and
distribution
an
anarchist
needs
to
supplement
his
anarchism
by
some
economic
propositions
which
may
enable
him
to
put
in
practical
shape
to
himself
and
others
this
possibility
of
independent
manhood
that
will
be
his
test
in
choosing
any
such
proposition
the
measure
in
which
individuality
is
secured
it
is
not
enough
for
him
that
a
comfortable
ease
a
pleasant
and
routine
shall
be
secured
free
play
for
the
spirit
of
change
that
is
his
first
demand
every
anarchist
has
this
in
common
with
every
other
anarchist
that
the
economic
system
must
be
subservient
to
this
end
no
system
recommends
itself
to
him
by
the
mere
beauty
and
smoothness
of
its
working
jealous
of
the
encroachments
of
the
machine
he
looks
with
fierce
suspicion
upon
an
arithmetic
with
men
for
units
a
society
running
in
slots
and
grooves
with
the
precision
so
beautiful
to
one
in
whom
the
love
of
order
is
first
but
which
only
makes
him
sniff
pfaugh
it
smells
of
machine
oil
there
are
accordingly
several
economic
schools
among
anarchists
there
are
anarchist
individualists
anarchist
mutualists
anarchist
communists
and
anarchist
socialists
in
times
past
these
several
schools
have
bitterly
denounced
each
other
and
mutually
refused
to
recognize
each
other
as
anarchists
at
all
the
more
on
both
sides
still
do
so
true
they
do
not
consider
it
is
but
simply
a
firm
and
solid
grasp
of
the
truth
which
does
not
permit
of
tolerance
towards
error
this
has
been
the
attitude
of
the
bigot
in
all
ages
and
anarchism
no
more
than
any
other
new
doctrine
has
escaped
its
bigots
each
of
these
fanatical
adherents
of
either
collectivism
or
individualism
believes
that
no
anarchism
is
possible
without
that
particular
economic
system
as
its
guarantee
and
is
of
course
thoroughly
justified
from
his
own
standpoint
with
the
extension
of
what
comrade
brown
calls
the
new
spirit
however
this
old
narrowness
is
yielding
to
the
broader
kindlier
and
far
more
reasonable
idea
that
all
these
economic
conceptions
may
be
experimented
with
and
there
is
nothing
about
any
of
them
until
the
element
of
compulsion
enters
and
obliges
unwilling
persons
to
remain
in
a
community
whose
economic
arrangements
they
do
not
agree
to
when
i
say
do
not
agree
to
i
do
not
mean
that
they
have
a
mere
distaste
for
or
that
they
think
might
well
be
altered
for
some
other
preferable
arrangement
but
with
which
nevertheless
they
quite
easily
put
up
as
two
persons
each
living
in
the
same
house
and
having
different
tastes
in
decoration
will
submit
to
some
color
of
window
shade
or
bit
of
which
he
does
not
like
so
well
but
which
nevertheless
he
cheerfully
puts
up
with
for
the
satisfaction
of
being
with
his
friend
i
mean
serious
differences
which
in
their
opinion
threaten
their
essential
liberties
i
make
this
explanation
about
trifles
because
the
objections
which
are
raised
to
the
doctrine
that
men
may
live
in
society
freely
almost
always
degenerate
into
trivialities
such
as
what
would
you
do
if
two
ladies
wanted
the
same
hat
etc
we
do
not
advocate
the
abolition
of
common
sense
and
every
person
of
sense
is
willing
to
surrender
his
preferences
at
times
provided
he
is
not
to
at
all
costs
therefore
i
say
that
each
group
of
persons
acting
socially
in
freedom
may
choose
any
of
the
proposed
systems
and
be
just
as
anarchists
as
those
who
select
another
if
this
standpoint
be
accepted
we
are
rid
of
those
outrageous
excommunications
which
belong
properly
to
the
church
of
rome
and
which
serve
no
purpose
but
to
bring
us
into
deserved
contempt
with
outsiders
furthermore
having
accepted
it
from
a
purely
theoretical
process
of
reasoning
i
believe
one
is
then
in
an
attitude
of
mind
to
perceive
certain
material
factors
in
the
problem
which
account
for
these
differences
in
proposed
systems
and
which
even
demand
such
differences
so
long
as
production
is
in
its
present
state
i
shall
now
dwell
briefly
upon
these
various
propositions
and
explain
as
i
go
along
what
the
material
factors
are
to
which
i
have
just
alluded
taking
the
last
first
namely
anarchist
socialism
its
economic
program
is
the
same
as
that
of
political
socialism
in
its
entirety
i
mean
before
the
working
of
practical
politics
has
frittered
the
socialism
away
into
a
mere
list
of
governmental
ameliorations
such
anarchist
socialists
hold
that
the
state
the
centralized
government
has
been
and
ever
will
be
the
business
agent
of
the
class
that
it
is
an
expression
of
a
certain
material
condition
purely
and
with
the
passing
of
that
condition
the
state
must
also
pass
that
socialism
meaning
the
complete
taking
over
of
all
forms
of
property
from
the
hands
of
men
as
the
indivisible
possession
of
man
brings
with
it
as
a
logical
inevitable
result
the
dissolution
of
the
state
they
believe
that
every
individual
having
an
equal
claim
upon
the
social
production
the
incentive
to
grabbing
and
holding
being
gone
crimes
which
are
in
nearly
all
cases
the
instinctive
answer
to
some
antecedent
denial
of
that
claim
to
one
share
will
vanish
and
with
them
the
last
excuse
for
the
existence
of
the
state
they
do
not
as
a
rule
look
forward
to
any
such
transformations
in
the
material
aspect
of
society
as
some
of
the
rest
of
us
do
a
londoner
once
said
to
me
that
he
believed
london
would
keep
on
growing
the
flux
and
reflux
of
nations
keep
on
pouring
through
its
serpentine
streets
its
hundred
thousand
keep
on
jaunting
just
the
same
and
all
that
tremendous
traffic
which
fascinates
and
horrifies
continue
rolling
like
a
great
flood
up
and
down
up
and
down
like
the
after
the
realization
of
anarchism
as
it
does
now
that
londoner
name
was
john
turner
he
said
on
the
same
occasion
that
he
believed
thoroughly
in
the
economics
of
socialism
now
this
branch
of
the
anarchist
party
came
out
of
the
old
socialist
party
and
originally
represented
the
revolutionary
wing
of
that
party
as
opposed
to
those
who
took
up
the
notion
of
using
politics
and
i
believe
the
material
reason
which
accounts
for
their
acceptance
of
that
particular
economic
scheme
is
this
of
course
it
applies
to
all
european
socialists
that
the
social
development
of
europe
is
a
thing
of
history
that
almost
from
time
immemorial
there
has
been
a
recognized
class
struggle
that
no
workman
living
nor
yet
his
father
nor
his
grandfather
nor
his
has
seen
the
land
of
europe
pass
in
vast
blocks
from
an
unclaimed
public
inheritance
into
the
hands
of
an
ordinary
individual
like
himself
without
a
title
or
any
distinguishing
mark
above
himself
as
we
in
america
have
seen
the
land
and
the
have
been
to
him
always
unapproachable
quantities
a
recognized
source
of
oppression
class
and
again
the
industrial
development
in
town
and
city
coming
as
a
means
of
escape
from
feudal
oppression
but
again
bringing
with
it
its
own
oppressions
also
with
a
long
history
of
warfare
behind
it
has
served
to
bind
the
sense
of
class
fealty
upon
the
common
people
of
the
manufacturing
towns
so
that
blind
stupid
and
as
they
no
doubt
are
there
is
a
vague
dull
but
very
certainly
existing
feeling
that
they
must
look
for
help
in
association
together
and
regard
with
suspicion
or
indifference
any
proposition
which
proposes
to
help
them
by
helping
their
employers
moreover
socialism
has
been
an
ever
recurring
dream
through
the
long
story
of
revolt
in
europe
anarchists
like
others
are
born
into
it
it
is
not
until
they
pass
over
seas
and
come
in
contact
with
other
conditions
breathe
the
atmosphere
of
other
thoughts
that
they
are
able
to
see
other
possibilities
as
well
if
i
may
venture
at
this
point
a
criticism
of
this
position
of
the
anarchist
socialist
i
would
say
that
the
great
flaw
in
this
conception
of
the
state
is
in
supposing
it
to
be
of
origin
the
state
is
not
merely
the
tool
of
the
governing
classes
it
has
its
root
far
down
in
the
religious
development
of
human
nature
and
will
not
fall
apart
merely
through
the
abolition
of
classes
and
property
there
is
other
work
to
be
done
as
to
the
economic
program
i
shall
criticise
that
together
with
all
the
other
propositions
when
i
sum
up
anarchist
communism
is
a
modification
rather
an
evolution
of
anarchist
socialism
most
anarchist
communists
i
believe
do
look
forward
to
great
changes
in
the
distribution
of
people
upon
the
surface
through
the
realization
of
anarchism
most
of
them
agree
that
the
opening
up
of
the
land
together
with
the
free
use
of
tools
would
lead
to
a
breaking
up
of
these
vast
communities
called
cities
and
the
formation
of
smaller
groups
or
communes
which
shall
be
held
together
by
a
free
recognition
of
common
interests
only
while
socialism
looks
forward
to
a
further
extension
of
the
modern
triumph
of
commerce
which
is
that
it
has
brought
the
products
of
the
entire
earth
to
your
free
communism
looks
upon
such
a
fever
of
exportation
and
importation
as
an
unhealthy
development
and
expects
rather
a
more
development
of
home
resources
doing
away
with
the
mass
of
supervision
required
for
the
systematic
conduct
of
such
world
exchange
it
appeals
to
the
plain
sense
of
the
workers
by
proposing
that
they
who
now
consider
themselves
helpless
dependents
upon
the
boss
ability
to
give
them
a
job
shall
constitute
themselves
independent
producing
groups
take
the
materials
do
the
work
they
do
that
now
deposit
the
products
in
the
warehouses
taking
what
they
want
for
themselves
and
letting
others
take
the
balance
to
do
this
no
government
no
employer
no
money
system
is
necessary
there
is
only
necessary
a
decent
regard
for
one
own
and
one
it
is
not
likely
indeed
it
is
devoutly
to
be
hoped
that
no
such
large
aggregations
of
men
as
now
assemble
daily
in
mills
and
factories
will
ever
come
together
by
mutual
desire
a
factory
is
a
for
all
that
is
vicious
in
human
nature
and
largely
because
of
its
crowding
only
the
notion
that
men
can
not
work
together
unless
they
have
a
to
take
a
percentage
of
their
product
is
contrary
both
to
good
sense
and
observed
fact
as
a
rule
bosses
simply
make
confusion
worse
confounded
when
they
attempt
to
mix
in
a
workman
snarls
as
every
mechanic
has
had
practical
demonstration
of
and
as
to
social
effort
why
men
worked
in
common
while
they
were
monkeys
yet
if
you
do
believe
it
go
and
watch
the
monkeys
they
do
surrender
their
individual
freedom
either
in
short
the
real
workmen
will
make
their
own
regulations
decide
when
and
where
and
how
things
shall
be
done
it
is
not
necessary
that
the
projector
of
an
anarchist
communist
society
shall
say
in
what
manner
separate
industries
shall
be
conducted
nor
do
they
presume
to
he
simply
conjures
the
spirit
of
dare
and
do
in
the
plainest
workmen
says
to
them
it
is
you
who
know
how
to
mine
how
to
dig
how
to
cut
you
will
know
how
to
organize
your
work
without
a
dictator
we
can
not
tell
you
but
we
have
full
faith
that
you
will
find
the
way
yourselves
you
will
never
be
free
men
until
you
acquire
that
same
as
to
the
problem
of
the
exact
exchange
of
equivalents
which
so
frets
the
reformers
of
other
schools
to
him
it
does
not
exist
so
there
is
enough
who
cares
the
sources
of
wealth
remain
indivisible
forever
who
cares
if
one
has
a
little
more
or
less
so
all
have
enough
who
cares
if
something
goes
to
waste
let
it
waste
the
rotted
apple
fertilizes
the
ground
as
well
as
if
it
had
comforted
the
animal
economy
first
and
indeed
you
who
worry
so
much
about
system
and
order
and
adjustment
of
production
to
consumption
you
waste
more
human
energy
in
making
your
account
than
the
precious
calculation
is
worth
hence
money
with
all
its
retinue
of
complications
and
trickeries
is
abolished
small
independent
freely
cooperating
communes
this
is
the
economic
ideal
which
is
accepted
by
most
of
the
anarchists
of
the
old
world
as
to
the
material
factor
which
developed
this
ideal
among
europeans
it
is
the
recollection
and
even
some
still
remaining
vestiges
of
the
mediæval
village
commune
those
oases
in
the
great
sahara
of
human
degradation
presented
in
the
history
of
the
middle
ages
when
the
catholic
church
stood
triumphant
upon
man
in
the
dust
such
is
the
ideal
glamored
with
the
dead
gold
of
a
sun
which
has
set
which
gleams
through
the
pages
of
morris
and
kropotkin
we
in
america
never
knew
the
village
commune
white
civilization
struck
our
shores
in
a
broad
and
swept
over
the
country
inclusively
among
us
was
never
seen
the
little
commune
growing
up
from
a
state
of
barbarism
independently
out
of
primary
industries
and
maintaining
itself
within
itself
there
was
no
gradual
change
from
the
mode
of
life
of
the
native
people
to
our
own
there
was
a
wiping
out
and
a
complete
transplantation
of
the
latest
form
of
european
civilization
the
idea
of
the
little
commune
therefore
comes
instinctively
to
the
anarchists
of
europe
particularly
the
continental
ones
with
them
it
is
merely
the
conscious
development
of
a
submerged
instinct
with
americans
it
is
an
importation
i
believe
that
most
anarchist
communists
avoid
the
blunder
of
the
socialists
in
regarding
the
state
as
the
offspring
of
material
conditions
purely
though
they
lay
great
stress
upon
its
being
the
tool
of
property
and
contend
that
in
one
form
or
another
the
state
will
exist
so
long
as
there
is
property
at
all
i
pass
to
the
extreme
individualists
those
who
hold
to
the
tradition
of
political
economy
and
are
firm
in
the
idea
that
the
system
of
employer
and
employed
buying
and
selling
banking
and
all
the
other
essential
institutions
of
commercialism
centering
upon
private
property
are
in
themselves
good
and
are
rendered
vicious
merely
by
the
interference
of
the
state
their
chief
economic
propositions
are
land
to
be
held
by
individuals
or
companies
for
such
time
and
in
such
allotments
as
they
use
only
redistribution
to
take
place
as
often
as
the
members
of
the
community
shall
agree
what
constitutes
use
to
be
decided
by
each
community
presumably
in
town
meeting
assembled
disputed
cases
to
be
settled
by
a
free
jury
to
be
chosen
by
lot
out
of
the
entire
group
members
not
coinciding
in
the
decisions
of
the
group
to
betake
themselves
to
outlying
lands
not
occupied
without
let
or
hindrance
from
any
one
money
to
represent
all
staple
commodities
to
be
issued
by
whomsoever
pleases
naturally
it
would
come
to
individuals
depositing
their
securities
with
banks
and
accepting
bank
notes
in
return
such
bank
notes
representing
the
labor
expended
in
production
and
being
issued
in
sufficient
quantity
there
being
no
limit
upon
any
one
starting
in
the
business
whenever
interest
began
to
rise
more
banks
would
be
organized
and
thus
the
rate
per
cent
would
be
constantly
checked
by
competition
exchange
would
take
place
freely
commodities
would
circulate
business
of
all
kinds
would
be
stimulated
and
the
government
privilege
being
taken
away
from
inventions
industries
would
spring
up
at
every
turn
bosses
would
be
hunting
men
rather
than
men
bosses
wages
would
rise
to
the
full
measure
of
the
individual
production
and
forever
remain
there
property
real
property
would
at
last
exist
which
it
does
not
at
the
present
day
because
no
man
gets
what
he
makes
the
charm
in
this
program
is
that
it
proposes
no
sweeping
changes
in
our
daily
retinue
it
does
not
bewilder
us
as
more
revolutionary
propositions
do
its
remedies
are
ones
they
do
not
depend
upon
conscious
efforts
of
individuals
to
establish
justice
and
build
harmony
competition
in
freedom
is
the
great
automatic
valve
which
opens
or
closes
as
demands
increase
or
diminish
and
all
that
is
necessary
is
to
let
well
enough
alone
and
not
attempt
to
assist
it
it
is
sure
that
nine
americans
in
ten
who
have
never
heard
of
any
of
these
programs
before
will
listen
with
far
more
interest
and
approval
to
this
than
to
the
others
the
material
reason
which
explains
this
attitude
of
mind
is
very
evident
in
this
country
outside
of
the
negro
question
we
have
never
had
the
historic
division
of
classes
we
are
just
making
that
history
now
we
have
never
felt
the
need
of
the
associative
spirit
of
workman
with
workman
because
in
our
society
it
has
been
the
individual
that
did
things
the
workman
of
was
the
employer
vast
opportunities
lying
open
to
him
in
the
undeveloped
territory
he
shouldered
his
tools
and
struck
out
for
himself
even
now
fiercer
and
fiercer
though
the
struggle
is
growing
tighter
and
tighter
though
the
workman
is
getting
cornered
the
line
of
division
between
class
and
class
is
constantly
being
broken
and
the
first
motto
of
the
american
is
the
lord
helps
him
who
helps
himself
consequently
this
economic
program
whose
is
let
alone
appeals
strongly
to
the
traditional
sympathies
and
life
habits
of
a
people
who
have
themselves
seen
an
almost
unbounded
patrimony
swept
up
as
a
gambler
sweeps
his
stakes
by
men
who
played
with
them
at
school
or
worked
with
them
in
one
shop
a
year
or
ten
years
before
this
particular
branch
of
the
anarchist
party
does
not
accept
the
communist
position
that
government
arises
from
property
on
the
contrary
they
hold
government
responsible
for
the
denial
of
real
property
viz
to
the
producer
the
exclusive
possession
of
what
he
has
produced
they
lay
more
stress
upon
its
metaphysical
origin
in
the
fear
in
human
nature
their
attack
is
directed
centrally
upon
the
idea
of
authority
thus
the
material
wrongs
seem
to
flow
from
the
spiritual
error
if
i
may
venture
the
word
without
fear
of
misconstruction
which
is
precisely
the
reverse
of
the
socialistic
view
truth
lies
not
the
two
but
in
a
synthesis
of
the
two
opinions
anarchist
mutualism
is
a
modification
of
the
program
of
individualism
laying
more
emphasis
upon
organization
and
free
federation
of
the
workers
to
these
the
trade
union
is
the
nucleus
of
the
free
group
which
will
obviate
the
necessity
of
an
employer
issue
to
its
members
take
charge
of
the
finished
product
exchange
with
different
trade
groups
for
their
mutual
advantage
through
the
central
federation
enable
its
members
to
utilize
their
credit
and
likewise
insure
them
against
loss
the
mutualist
position
on
the
land
question
is
identical
with
that
of
the
individualists
as
well
as
their
understanding
of
the
state
the
material
factor
which
accounts
for
such
differences
as
there
are
between
individualists
and
mutualists
is
i
think
the
fact
that
the
first
originated
in
the
brains
of
those
who
whether
workmen
or
business
men
lived
by
independent
exertion
josiah
warren
though
a
poor
man
lived
in
an
individualist
way
and
made
his
social
experiment
in
small
country
settlements
far
removed
from
the
great
organized
industries
tucker
also
though
a
city
man
has
never
had
personal
association
with
such
industries
they
had
never
known
directly
the
oppressions
of
the
large
factory
nor
mingled
with
associations
the
mutualists
had
consequently
their
leaning
towards
a
greater
communism
dyer
lum
spent
the
greater
part
of
his
life
in
building
up
workmen
unions
himself
being
a
hand
worker
a
by
trade
i
have
now
presented
the
rough
skeleton
of
four
different
economic
schemes
entertained
by
anarchists
remember
that
the
point
of
agreement
in
all
is
those
who
favor
one
method
have
no
intention
of
forcing
it
upon
those
who
favor
another
so
long
as
equal
tolerance
is
exercised
toward
themselves
remember
also
that
none
of
these
schemes
is
proposed
for
its
own
sake
but
because
through
it
its
projectors
believe
liberty
may
be
best
secured
every
anarchist
as
an
anarchist
would
be
perfectly
willing
to
surrender
his
own
scheme
directly
if
he
saw
that
another
worked
better
for
myself
i
believe
that
all
these
and
many
more
could
be
advantageously
tried
in
different
localities
i
would
see
the
instincts
and
habits
of
the
people
express
themselves
in
a
free
choice
in
every
community
and
i
am
sure
that
distinct
environments
would
call
out
distinct
adaptations
personally
while
i
recognize
that
liberty
would
be
greatly
extended
under
any
of
these
economies
i
frankly
confess
that
none
of
them
satisfies
me
socialism
and
communism
both
demand
a
degree
of
joint
effort
and
administration
which
would
beget
more
regulation
than
is
wholly
consistent
with
ideal
anarchism
individualism
and
mutualism
resting
upon
property
involve
a
development
of
the
private
policeman
not
at
all
compatible
with
my
notions
of
freedom
my
ideal
would
be
a
condition
in
which
all
natural
resources
would
be
forever
free
to
all
and
the
worker
individually
able
to
produce
for
himself
sufficient
for
all
his
vital
needs
if
he
so
chose
so
that
he
need
not
govern
his
working
or
not
working
by
the
times
and
seasons
of
his
fellows
i
think
that
time
may
come
but
it
will
only
be
through
the
development
of
the
modes
of
production
and
the
taste
of
the
people
meanwhile
we
all
cry
with
one
voice
for
the
freedom
are
these
all
the
aims
of
anarchism
they
are
just
the
beginning
they
are
an
outline
of
what
is
demanded
for
the
material
producer
if
as
a
worker
you
think
no
further
than
how
to
free
yourself
from
the
horrible
bondage
of
capitalism
then
that
is
the
measure
of
anarchism
for
you
but
you
yourself
put
the
limit
there
if
there
it
is
put
immeasurably
deeper
immeasurably
higher
dips
and
soars
the
soul
which
has
come
out
of
its
casement
of
custom
and
cowardice
and
dared
to
claim
its
self
ah
once
to
stand
unflinchingly
on
the
brink
of
that
dark
gulf
of
passions
and
desires
once
at
last
to
send
a
bold
gaze
down
into
the
volcanic
me
once
and
in
that
once
and
in
that
once
to
throw
off
the
command
to
cover
and
flee
from
the
knowledge
of
that
abyss
nay
to
dare
it
to
hiss
and
seethe
if
it
will
and
make
us
writhe
and
shiver
with
its
force
once
and
forever
to
realize
that
one
is
not
a
bundle
of
little
reasons
bound
up
in
the
front
room
of
the
brain
to
be
sermonized
and
held
in
order
with
maxims
or
moved
and
stopped
by
a
syllogism
but
a
bottomless
bottomless
depth
of
all
strange
sensations
a
rocking
sea
of
feeling
wherever
sweep
strong
storms
of
unaccountable
hate
and
rage
invisible
contortions
of
disappointment
low
ebbs
of
meanness
quakings
and
shudderings
of
love
that
drives
to
madness
and
will
not
be
controlled
hungerings
and
moanings
and
sobbing
that
smite
upon
the
inner
ear
now
first
bent
to
listen
as
if
all
the
sadness
of
the
sea
and
the
wailing
of
the
great
pine
forests
of
the
north
had
met
to
weep
together
there
in
that
silence
audible
to
you
alone
to
look
down
into
that
to
know
the
blackness
the
midnight
the
dead
ages
in
oneself
to
feel
the
jungle
and
the
beast
within
and
the
swamp
and
the
slime
and
the
desolate
desert
of
the
heart
despair
to
see
to
know
to
feel
to
the
uttermost
and
then
to
look
at
one
fellow
sitting
across
from
one
in
the
so
decorous
so
well
got
up
so
nicely
combed
and
brushed
and
oiled
and
to
wonder
what
lies
beneath
that
commonplace
exterior
to
picture
the
cavern
in
him
which
somewhere
far
below
has
a
narrow
gallery
running
into
your
own
to
imagine
the
pain
that
racks
him
to
the
perhaps
while
he
wears
that
placid
countenance
to
conceive
how
he
too
shudders
at
himself
and
writhes
and
flees
from
the
lava
of
his
heart
and
aches
in
his
not
daring
to
see
himself
to
draw
back
respectfully
from
the
of
the
plainest
most
unpromising
creature
even
from
the
most
debased
criminal
because
one
knows
the
nonentity
and
the
criminal
in
oneself
to
spare
all
condemnation
how
much
more
trial
and
sentence
because
one
knows
the
stuff
of
which
man
is
made
and
recoils
at
nothing
since
all
is
in
himself
this
is
what
anarchism
may
mean
to
you
it
means
that
to
me
and
then
to
turn
cloudward
starward
skyward
and
let
the
dreams
rush
over
one
no
longer
awed
by
outside
powers
of
any
order
recognizing
nothing
superior
to
oneself
painting
painting
endless
pictures
creating
unheard
symphonies
that
sing
dream
sounds
to
you
alone
extending
sympathies
to
the
dumb
brutes
as
equal
brothers
kissing
the
flowers
as
one
did
when
a
child
letting
oneself
go
free
go
free
beyond
the
bounds
of
what
and
call
the
possible
this
too
anarchism
may
mean
to
you
if
you
dare
to
apply
it
so
and
if
you
do
some
day
if
sitting
at
your
you
see
a
vision
of
surpassing
glory
some
picture
of
that
golden
time
when
there
shall
be
no
prisons
on
the
earth
nor
hunger
nor
houselessness
nor
accusation
nor
judgment
and
hearts
open
as
printed
leaves
and
candid
as
fearlessness
if
then
you
look
across
at
your
neighbor
who
sweats
and
smells
and
curses
at
his
toil
remember
that
as
you
do
not
know
his
depth
neither
do
you
know
his
height
he
too
might
dream
if
the
yoke
of
custom
and
law
and
dogma
were
broken
from
him
even
now
you
know
not
what
blind
bound
motionless
chrysalis
is
working
there
to
prepare
its
winged
thing
anarchism
means
freedom
to
the
soul
as
to
the
body
in
every
aspiration
every
growth
a
few
words
as
to
the
methods
in
times
past
anarchists
have
excluded
each
other
on
these
grounds
also
revolutionists
contemptuously
said
quaker
of
peace
men
savage
communists
anathematized
the
quakers
in
return
this
too
is
passing
i
say
this
all
methods
are
to
the
individual
capacity
and
decision
there
is
tolstoy
christian
artist
his
method
is
to
paint
pictures
of
society
as
it
is
to
show
the
brutality
of
force
and
the
uselessness
of
it
to
preach
the
end
of
government
through
the
repudiation
of
all
military
force
good
i
accept
it
in
its
entirety
it
fits
his
character
it
fits
his
ability
let
us
be
glad
that
he
works
so
there
is
john
most
old
with
the
weight
of
prison
years
upon
him
yet
fiercer
fiercer
bitterer
in
his
denunciations
of
the
ruling
class
than
would
require
the
energy
of
a
dozen
younger
men
to
utter
going
down
the
last
hills
of
life
rousing
the
consciousness
of
wrong
among
his
fellows
as
he
goes
good
that
consciousness
must
be
awakened
long
may
that
fiery
tongue
yet
speak
there
is
benjamin
tucker
cool
critical
sending
his
fine
hard
shafts
among
foes
and
friends
with
icy
impartiality
hitting
swift
and
cutting
keen
and
ever
ready
to
nail
a
traitor
holding
to
passive
resistance
as
most
effective
ready
to
change
it
whenever
he
deems
it
wise
that
suits
him
in
his
field
he
is
alone
invaluable
and
there
is
peter
kropotkin
appealing
to
the
young
and
looking
with
sweet
warm
eager
eyes
into
every
colonizing
effort
and
hailing
with
a
child
enthusiasm
the
uprisings
of
the
workers
and
believing
in
revolution
with
his
whole
soul
him
too
we
thank
and
there
is
george
brown
preaching
peaceable
expropriation
through
the
federated
unions
of
the
workers
and
this
is
good
it
is
his
best
place
he
is
at
home
there
he
can
accomplish
most
in
his
own
chosen
field
and
over
there
in
his
coffin
cell
in
italy
lies
the
man
whose
method
was
to
kill
a
king
and
shock
the
nations
into
a
sudden
consciousness
of
the
hollowness
of
their
law
and
order
him
too
him
and
his
act
without
reserve
i
accept
and
bend
in
silent
acknowledgement
of
the
strength
of
the
man
for
there
are
some
whose
nature
it
is
to
think
and
plead
and
yield
and
yet
return
to
the
address
and
so
make
headway
in
the
minds
of
their
fellowmen
and
there
are
others
who
are
stern
and
still
resolute
implacable
as
judah
dream
of
god
and
those
men
strike
strike
once
and
have
ended
but
the
blow
resounds
across
the
world
and
as
on
a
night
when
the
sky
is
heavy
with
storm
some
sudden
great
white
flare
sheets
across
it
and
every
object
starts
sharply
out
so
in
the
flash
of
bresci
pistol
shot
the
whole
world
for
a
moment
saw
the
tragic
figure
of
the
italian
people
starved
stunted
crippled
huddled
degraded
murdered
and
at
the
same
moment
that
their
teeth
chattered
with
fear
they
came
and
asked
the
anarchists
to
explain
themselves
and
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
read
more
in
those
few
days
than
they
had
ever
read
of
the
idea
before
ask
a
method
do
you
ask
spring
her
method
which
is
more
necessary
the
sunshine
or
the
rain
they
are
contradictory
yes
they
destroy
each
other
yes
but
from
this
destruction
the
flowers
result
each
choose
that
method
which
expresses
your
best
and
condemn
no
other
man
because
he
expresses
his
self
otherwise
anarchism
and
american
traditions
american
traditions
begotten
of
religious
rebellion
small
communities
isolated
conditions
and
hard
pioneer
life
grew
during
the
colonization
period
of
one
hundred
and
seventy
years
from
the
settling
of
jamestown
to
the
outburst
of
the
revolution
this
was
in
fact
the
great
epoch
the
period
of
charters
guaranteeing
more
or
less
of
liberty
the
general
tendency
of
which
is
well
described
by
wm
penn
in
speaking
of
the
charter
for
pennsylvania
i
want
to
put
it
out
of
my
power
or
that
of
my
successors
to
do
mischief
the
revolution
is
the
sudden
and
unified
consciousness
of
these
traditions
their
loud
assertion
the
blow
dealt
by
their
indomitable
will
against
the
counter
force
of
tyranny
which
has
never
entirely
recovered
from
the
blow
but
which
from
then
till
now
has
gone
on
remolding
and
regrappling
the
instruments
of
governmental
power
that
the
revolution
sought
to
shape
and
hold
as
defenses
of
liberty
to
the
average
american
of
the
revolution
means
the
series
of
battles
fought
by
the
patriot
army
with
the
armies
of
england
the
millions
of
school
children
who
attend
our
public
schools
are
taught
to
draw
maps
of
the
siege
of
boston
and
the
siege
of
yorktown
to
know
the
general
plan
of
the
several
campaigns
to
quote
the
number
of
prisoners
of
war
surrendered
with
burgoyne
they
are
required
to
remember
the
date
when
washington
crossed
the
delaware
on
the
ice
they
are
told
to
remember
paoli
to
repeat
molly
stark
a
widow
to
call
general
wayne
mad
anthony
wayne
and
to
execrate
benedict
arnold
they
know
that
the
declaration
of
independence
was
signed
on
the
fourth
of
july
and
the
treaty
of
paris
in
and
then
they
think
they
have
learned
the
revolution
blessed
be
george
washington
they
have
no
idea
why
it
should
have
been
called
a
revolution
instead
of
the
english
war
or
any
similar
title
it
the
name
of
it
that
all
and
both
in
child
and
man
has
acquired
such
mastery
of
them
that
the
name
american
revolution
is
held
sacred
though
it
means
to
them
nothing
more
than
successful
force
while
the
name
revolution
applied
to
a
further
possibility
is
a
spectre
detested
and
abhorred
in
neither
case
have
they
any
idea
of
the
content
of
the
word
save
that
of
armed
force
that
has
already
happened
and
long
happened
which
jefferson
foresaw
when
he
wrote
the
spirit
of
the
times
may
alter
will
alter
our
rulers
will
become
corrupt
our
people
careless
a
single
zealot
may
become
persecutor
and
better
men
be
his
victims
it
can
never
be
too
often
repeated
that
the
time
for
fixing
every
essential
right
on
a
legal
basis
is
while
our
rulers
are
honest
ourselves
united
the
conclusion
of
this
war
we
shall
be
going
down
it
will
not
then
be
necessary
to
resort
every
moment
to
the
people
for
support
they
will
be
forgotten
therefore
and
their
rights
disregarded
they
will
forget
themselves
in
the
sole
faculty
of
making
money
and
will
never
think
of
uniting
to
effect
a
due
respect
for
their
rights
the
shackles
therefore
which
shall
not
be
knocked
off
at
the
conclusion
of
this
war
will
be
heavier
and
heavier
till
our
rights
shall
revive
or
expire
in
a
convulsion
to
the
men
of
that
time
who
voiced
the
spirit
of
that
time
the
battles
that
they
fought
were
the
least
of
the
revolution
they
were
the
incidents
of
the
hour
the
things
they
met
and
faced
as
part
of
the
game
they
were
playing
but
the
stake
they
had
in
view
before
during
and
after
the
war
the
real
revolution
was
a
change
in
political
institutions
which
should
make
of
government
not
a
thing
apart
a
superior
power
to
stand
over
the
people
with
a
whip
but
a
serviceable
agent
responsible
economical
and
trustworthy
but
never
so
much
trusted
as
not
to
be
continually
watched
for
the
transaction
of
such
business
as
was
the
common
concern
and
to
set
the
limits
of
the
common
concern
at
the
line
where
one
man
liberty
would
encroach
upon
another
they
thus
took
their
starting
point
for
deriving
a
minimum
of
government
upon
the
same
sociological
ground
that
the
modern
anarchist
derives
the
theory
that
equal
liberty
is
the
political
ideal
the
difference
lies
in
the
belief
on
the
one
hand
that
the
closest
approximation
to
equal
liberty
might
be
best
secured
by
the
rule
of
the
majority
in
those
matters
involving
united
action
of
any
kind
which
rule
of
the
majority
they
thought
it
possible
to
secure
by
a
few
simple
arrangements
for
election
and
on
the
other
hand
the
belief
that
majority
rule
is
both
impossible
and
undesirable
that
any
government
no
matter
what
its
forms
will
be
manipulated
by
a
very
small
minority
as
the
development
of
the
state
and
united
states
governments
has
strikingly
proved
that
candidates
will
loudly
profess
allegiance
to
platforms
before
elections
which
as
officials
in
power
they
will
openly
disregard
to
do
as
they
please
and
that
even
if
the
majority
will
could
be
imposed
it
would
also
be
subversive
of
equal
liberty
which
may
be
best
secured
by
leaving
to
the
voluntary
association
of
those
interested
in
the
management
of
matters
of
common
concern
without
coercion
of
the
uninterested
or
the
opposed
among
the
fundamental
likenesses
between
the
revolutionary
republicans
and
the
anarchists
is
the
recognition
that
the
little
must
precede
the
great
that
the
local
must
be
the
basis
of
the
general
that
there
can
be
a
free
federation
only
when
there
are
free
communities
to
federate
that
the
spirit
of
the
latter
is
carried
into
the
councils
of
the
former
and
a
local
tyranny
may
thus
become
an
instrument
for
general
enslavement
convinced
of
the
supreme
importance
of
ridding
the
municipalities
of
the
institutions
of
tyranny
the
most
strenuous
advocates
of
independence
instead
of
spending
their
efforts
mainly
in
the
general
congress
devoted
themselves
to
their
home
localities
endeavoring
to
work
out
of
the
minds
of
their
neighbors
and
the
institutions
of
entailed
property
of
a
of
a
people
even
the
institution
of
african
slavery
itself
though
largely
unsuccessful
it
is
to
the
measure
of
success
they
did
achieve
that
we
are
indebted
for
such
liberties
as
we
do
retain
and
not
to
the
general
government
they
tried
to
inculcate
local
initiative
and
independent
action
the
author
of
the
declaration
of
independence
who
in
the
fall
of
declined
a
to
congress
in
order
to
return
to
virginia
and
do
his
work
in
his
own
local
assembly
in
arranging
there
for
public
education
which
he
justly
considered
a
matter
of
common
concern
said
his
advocacy
of
public
schools
was
not
with
any
view
to
take
its
ordinary
branches
out
of
the
hands
of
private
enterprise
which
manages
much
the
concerns
to
which
it
is
equal
and
in
endeavoring
to
make
clear
the
restrictions
of
the
constitution
upon
the
functions
of
the
general
government
he
likewise
said
let
the
general
government
be
reduced
to
foreign
concerns
only
and
let
our
affairs
be
disentangled
from
those
of
all
other
nations
except
as
to
commerce
the
merchants
will
manage
the
better
the
more
they
are
left
free
to
manage
for
and
the
general
government
may
be
reduced
to
a
very
simple
organization
and
a
very
inexpensive
one
a
few
plain
duties
to
be
performed
by
a
few
servants
this
then
was
the
american
tradition
that
private
enterprise
manages
better
all
that
to
which
it
is
equal
anarchism
declares
that
private
enterprise
whether
individual
or
is
equal
to
all
the
undertakings
of
society
and
it
quotes
the
particular
two
instances
education
and
commerce
which
the
governments
of
the
states
and
of
the
united
states
have
undertaken
to
manage
and
regulate
as
the
very
two
which
in
operation
have
done
more
to
destroy
american
freedom
and
equality
to
warp
and
distort
american
tradition
to
make
of
government
a
mighty
engine
of
tyranny
than
any
other
cause
save
the
unforeseen
developments
of
manufacture
it
was
the
intention
of
the
revolutionists
to
establish
a
system
of
common
education
which
should
make
the
teaching
of
history
one
of
its
principal
branches
not
with
the
intent
of
burdening
the
memories
of
our
youth
with
the
dates
of
battles
or
the
speeches
of
generals
nor
to
make
of
the
boston
tea
party
indians
the
one
sacrosanct
mob
in
all
history
to
be
revered
but
never
on
any
account
to
be
imitated
but
with
the
intent
that
every
american
should
know
to
what
conditions
the
masses
of
people
had
been
brought
by
the
operation
of
certain
institutions
by
what
means
they
had
wrung
out
their
liberties
and
how
those
liberties
had
again
and
again
been
filched
from
them
by
the
use
of
governmental
force
fraud
and
privilege
not
to
breed
security
laudation
complacent
indolence
passive
acquiescence
in
the
acts
of
a
government
protected
by
the
label
but
to
beget
a
wakeful
jealousy
a
watchfulness
of
rulers
a
determination
to
squelch
every
attempt
of
those
entrusted
with
power
to
encroach
upon
the
sphere
of
individual
action
this
was
the
prime
motive
of
the
revolutionists
in
endeavoring
to
provide
for
common
education
confidence
said
the
revolutionists
who
adopted
the
kentucky
resolutions
is
everywhere
the
parent
of
despotism
free
government
is
founded
in
jealousy
not
in
confidence
it
is
jealousy
not
confidence
which
prescribes
limited
constitutions
to
bind
down
those
whom
we
are
obliged
to
trust
with
power
our
constitution
has
accordingly
fixed
the
limits
to
which
and
no
further
our
confidence
may
go
in
questions
of
power
let
no
more
be
heard
of
confidence
in
man
but
bind
him
down
from
mischief
by
the
chains
of
the
constitution
these
resolutions
were
especially
applied
to
the
passage
of
the
alien
laws
by
the
monarchist
party
during
john
adams
administration
and
were
an
indignant
call
from
the
state
of
kentucky
to
repudiate
the
right
of
the
general
government
to
assume
undelegated
powers
for
said
they
to
accept
these
laws
would
be
to
be
bound
by
laws
made
not
with
our
consent
but
by
others
against
our
consent
that
is
to
surrender
the
form
of
government
we
have
chosen
and
to
live
under
one
deriving
its
powers
from
its
own
will
and
not
from
our
authority
resolutions
identical
in
spirit
were
also
passed
by
virginia
the
following
month
in
those
days
the
states
still
considered
themselves
supreme
the
general
government
subordinate
to
inculcate
this
proud
spirit
of
the
supremacy
of
the
people
over
their
governors
was
to
be
the
purpose
of
public
education
pick
up
any
common
school
history
and
see
how
much
of
this
spirit
you
will
find
therein
on
the
contrary
from
cover
to
cover
you
will
find
nothing
but
the
cheapest
sort
of
patriotism
the
inculcation
of
the
most
unquestioning
acquiescence
in
the
deeds
of
government
a
lullaby
of
rest
security
confidence
the
doctrine
that
the
law
can
do
no
wrong
a
te
deum
in
praise
of
the
continuous
encroachments
of
the
powers
of
the
general
government
upon
the
reserved
rights
of
the
states
shameless
falsification
of
all
acts
of
rebellion
to
put
the
government
in
the
right
and
the
rebels
in
the
wrong
pyrotechnic
glorifications
of
union
power
and
force
and
a
complete
ignoring
of
the
essential
liberties
to
maintain
which
was
the
purpose
of
the
revolutionists
the
law
of
passage
a
much
worse
law
than
the
alien
and
sedition
acts
which
roused
the
wrath
of
kentucky
and
virginia
to
the
point
of
threatened
rebellion
is
exalted
as
a
wise
provision
of
our
father
in
washington
such
is
the
spirit
of
schools
ask
any
child
what
he
knows
about
shays
rebellion
and
he
will
answer
oh
some
of
the
farmers
could
pay
their
taxes
and
shays
led
a
rebellion
against
the
at
worcester
so
they
could
burn
up
the
deeds
and
when
washington
heard
of
it
he
sent
over
an
army
quick
and
taught
a
good
lesson
and
what
was
the
result
of
it
the
result
why
why
the
result
was
oh
yes
i
remember
the
result
was
they
saw
the
need
of
a
strong
federal
government
to
collect
the
taxes
and
pay
the
debts
ask
if
he
knows
what
was
said
on
the
other
side
of
the
story
ask
if
he
knows
that
the
men
who
had
given
their
goods
and
their
health
and
their
strength
for
the
freeing
of
the
country
now
found
themselves
cast
into
prison
for
debt
sick
disabled
and
poor
facing
a
new
tyranny
for
the
old
that
their
demand
was
that
the
land
should
become
the
free
communal
possession
of
those
who
wished
to
work
it
not
subject
to
tribute
and
the
child
will
answer
no
ask
him
if
he
ever
read
jefferson
letter
to
madison
about
it
in
which
he
says
societies
exist
under
three
forms
sufficiently
distinguishable
without
government
as
among
our
indians
under
government
wherein
the
will
of
every
one
has
a
just
influence
as
is
the
case
in
england
in
a
slight
degree
and
in
our
states
in
a
great
one
under
government
of
force
as
is
the
case
in
all
other
monarchies
and
in
most
of
the
other
republics
to
have
an
idea
of
the
curse
of
existence
in
these
last
they
must
be
seen
it
is
a
government
of
wolves
over
sheep
it
is
a
problem
not
clear
in
my
mind
that
the
first
condition
is
not
the
best
but
i
believe
it
to
be
inconsistent
with
any
great
degree
of
population
the
second
state
has
a
great
deal
of
good
in
it
it
has
its
evils
too
the
principal
of
which
is
the
turbulence
to
which
it
is
subject
but
even
this
evil
is
productive
of
good
it
prevents
the
degeneracy
of
government
and
nourishes
a
general
attention
to
public
affairs
i
hold
that
a
little
rebellion
now
and
then
is
a
good
thing
or
to
another
correspondent
god
forbid
that
we
should
ever
be
twenty
years
without
such
a
rebellion
what
country
can
preserve
its
liberties
if
its
rulers
are
not
warned
from
time
to
time
that
the
people
preserve
the
spirit
of
resistance
let
them
take
up
arms
the
tree
of
liberty
must
be
refreshed
from
time
to
time
with
the
blood
of
patriots
and
tyrants
it
is
its
natural
manure
ask
any
school
child
if
he
was
ever
taught
that
the
author
of
the
declaration
of
independence
one
of
the
great
founders
of
the
common
school
said
these
things
and
he
will
look
at
you
with
open
mouth
and
unbelieving
eyes
ask
him
if
he
ever
heard
that
the
man
who
sounded
the
bugle
note
in
the
darkest
hour
of
the
crisis
who
roused
the
courage
of
the
soldiers
when
washington
saw
only
mutiny
and
despair
ahead
ask
him
if
he
knows
that
this
man
also
wrote
government
at
best
is
a
necessary
evil
at
worst
an
intolerable
one
and
if
he
is
a
little
better
informed
than
the
average
he
will
answer
oh
well
was
an
infidel
catechize
him
about
the
merits
of
the
constitution
which
he
has
learned
to
repeat
like
a
and
you
will
find
his
chief
conception
is
not
of
the
powers
withheld
from
congress
but
of
the
powers
granted
such
are
the
fruits
of
government
schools
we
the
anarchists
point
to
them
and
say
if
the
believers
in
liberty
wish
the
principles
of
liberty
taught
let
them
never
intrust
that
instruction
to
any
government
for
the
nature
of
government
is
to
become
a
thing
apart
an
institution
existing
for
its
own
sake
preying
upon
the
people
and
teaching
whatever
will
tend
to
keep
it
secure
in
its
seat
as
the
fathers
said
of
the
governments
of
europe
so
say
we
of
this
government
also
after
a
century
and
a
quarter
of
independence
the
blood
of
the
people
has
become
its
inheritance
and
those
who
fatten
on
it
will
not
relinquish
it
easily
public
education
having
to
do
with
the
intellect
and
spirit
of
a
people
is
probably
the
most
subtle
and
engine
for
molding
the
course
of
a
nation
but
commerce
dealing
as
it
does
with
material
things
and
producing
immediate
effects
was
the
force
that
bore
down
soonest
upon
the
paper
barriers
of
constitutional
restriction
and
shaped
the
government
to
its
requirements
here
indeed
we
arrive
at
the
point
where
we
looking
over
the
hundred
and
years
of
independence
can
see
that
the
simple
government
conceived
by
the
revolutionary
republicans
was
a
foredoomed
failure
it
was
so
because
of
the
essence
of
government
itself
the
essence
of
human
nature
the
essence
of
commerce
and
manufacture
of
the
essence
of
government
i
have
already
said
it
is
a
thing
apart
developing
its
own
interests
at
the
expense
of
what
opposes
it
all
attempts
to
make
it
anything
else
fail
in
this
anarchists
agree
with
the
traditional
enemies
of
the
revolution
the
monarchists
federalists
strong
government
believers
the
roosevelts
of
the
jays
marshalls
and
hamiltons
of
then
that
hamilton
who
as
secretary
of
the
treasury
devised
a
financial
system
of
which
we
are
the
unlucky
heritors
and
whose
objects
were
twofold
to
puzzle
the
people
and
make
public
finance
obscure
to
those
that
paid
for
it
to
serve
as
a
machine
for
corrupting
the
legislatures
for
he
avowed
the
opinion
that
man
could
be
governed
by
two
motives
only
force
or
interest
force
being
then
out
of
the
question
he
laid
hold
of
interest
the
greed
of
the
legislators
to
set
going
an
association
of
persons
having
an
entirely
separate
welfare
from
the
welfare
of
their
electors
bound
together
by
mutual
corruption
and
mutual
desire
for
plunder
the
anarchist
agrees
that
hamilton
was
logical
and
understood
the
core
of
government
the
difference
is
that
while
strong
governmentalists
believe
this
is
necessary
and
desirable
we
choose
the
opposite
conclusion
no
government
whatever
as
to
the
essence
of
human
nature
what
our
national
experience
has
made
plain
is
this
that
to
remain
in
a
continually
exalted
moral
condition
is
not
human
nature
that
has
happened
which
was
prophesied
we
have
gone
down
hill
from
the
revolution
until
now
we
are
absorbed
in
mere
the
desire
for
material
ease
long
ago
vanquished
the
spirit
of
what
was
that
spirit
the
spirit
that
animated
the
people
of
virginia
of
the
carolinas
of
massachusetts
of
new
york
when
they
refused
to
import
goods
from
england
when
they
preferred
and
stood
by
it
to
wear
coarse
homespun
cloth
to
drink
the
brew
of
their
own
growths
to
fit
their
appetites
to
the
home
supply
rather
than
submit
to
the
taxation
of
the
imperial
ministry
even
within
the
lifetime
of
the
revolutionists
the
spirit
decayed
the
love
of
material
ease
has
been
in
the
mass
of
men
and
permanently
speaking
always
greater
than
the
love
of
liberty
nine
hundred
and
women
out
of
a
thousand
are
more
interested
in
the
cut
of
a
dress
than
in
the
independence
of
their
sex
nine
hundred
and
men
out
of
a
thousand
are
more
interested
in
drinking
a
glass
of
beer
than
in
questioning
the
tax
that
is
laid
on
it
how
many
children
are
not
willing
to
trade
the
liberty
to
play
for
the
promise
of
a
new
cap
or
a
new
dress
this
it
is
which
begets
the
complicated
mechanism
of
society
this
it
is
which
by
multiplying
the
concerns
of
government
multiplies
the
strength
of
government
and
the
corresponding
weakness
of
the
people
this
it
is
which
begets
indifference
to
public
concern
thus
making
the
corruption
of
government
easy
as
to
the
essence
of
commerce
and
manufacture
it
is
this
to
establish
bonds
between
every
corner
of
the
earth
surface
and
every
other
corner
to
multiply
the
needs
of
mankind
and
the
desire
for
material
possession
and
enjoyment
the
american
tradition
was
the
isolation
of
the
states
as
far
as
possible
said
they
we
have
won
our
liberties
by
hard
sacrifice
and
struggle
unto
death
we
wish
now
to
be
let
alone
and
to
let
others
alone
that
our
principles
may
have
time
for
trial
that
we
may
become
accustomed
to
the
exercise
of
our
rights
that
we
may
be
kept
free
from
the
contaminating
influence
of
european
gauds
pagents
distinctions
so
richly
did
they
esteem
the
absence
of
these
that
they
could
in
all
fervor
write
we
shall
see
multiplied
instances
of
europeans
coming
to
america
but
no
man
living
will
ever
see
an
instance
of
an
american
removing
to
settle
in
europe
and
continuing
there
alas
in
less
than
a
hundred
years
the
highest
aim
of
a
daughter
of
the
revolution
was
and
is
to
buy
a
castle
a
title
and
a
rotten
lord
with
the
money
wrung
from
american
servitude
and
the
commercial
interests
of
america
are
seeking
a
in
the
earlier
days
of
the
revolt
and
subsequent
independence
it
appeared
that
the
manifest
destiny
of
america
was
to
be
an
agricultural
people
exchanging
food
stuffs
and
raw
materials
for
manufactured
articles
and
in
those
days
it
was
written
we
shall
be
virtuous
as
long
as
agriculture
is
our
principal
object
which
will
be
the
case
as
long
as
there
remain
vacant
lands
in
any
part
of
america
when
we
get
piled
upon
one
another
in
large
cities
as
in
europe
we
shall
become
corrupt
as
in
europe
and
go
to
eating
one
another
as
they
do
there
which
we
are
doing
because
of
the
inevitable
development
of
commerce
and
manufacture
and
the
concomitant
development
of
strong
government
and
the
parallel
prophecy
is
likewise
fulfilled
if
ever
this
vast
country
is
brought
under
a
single
government
it
will
be
one
of
the
most
extensive
corruption
indifferent
and
incapable
of
a
wholesome
care
over
so
wide
a
spread
of
surface
there
is
not
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
a
government
so
utterly
and
shamelessly
corrupt
as
that
of
the
united
states
of
america
there
are
others
more
cruel
more
tyrannical
more
devastating
there
is
none
so
utterly
venal
and
yet
even
in
the
very
days
of
the
prophets
even
with
their
own
consent
the
first
concession
to
this
later
tyranny
was
made
it
was
made
when
the
constitution
was
made
and
the
constitution
was
made
chiefly
because
of
the
demands
of
commerce
thus
it
was
at
the
outset
a
merchant
machine
which
the
other
interests
of
the
country
the
land
and
labor
interests
even
then
foreboded
would
destroy
their
liberties
in
vain
their
jealousy
of
its
central
power
made
them
enact
the
first
twelve
amendments
in
vain
they
endeavored
to
set
bounds
over
which
the
federal
power
dare
not
trench
in
vain
they
enacted
into
general
law
the
freedom
of
speech
of
the
press
of
assemblage
and
petition
all
of
these
things
we
see
ridden
upon
every
day
and
have
so
seen
with
more
or
less
intermission
since
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
at
this
day
every
police
lieutenant
considers
himself
and
rightly
so
as
more
powerful
than
the
general
law
of
the
union
and
that
one
who
told
robert
hunter
that
he
held
in
his
fist
something
stronger
than
the
constitution
was
perfectly
correct
the
right
of
assemblage
is
an
american
tradition
which
has
gone
out
of
fashion
the
police
club
is
now
the
mode
and
it
is
so
in
virtue
of
the
people
indifference
to
liberty
and
the
steady
progress
of
constitutional
interpretation
towards
the
substance
of
imperial
government
it
is
an
american
tradition
that
a
standing
army
is
a
standing
menace
to
liberty
in
jefferson
presidency
the
army
was
reduced
to
men
it
is
american
tradition
that
we
keep
out
of
the
affairs
of
other
nations
it
is
american
practice
that
we
meddle
with
the
affairs
of
everybody
else
from
the
west
to
the
east
indies
from
russia
to
japan
and
to
do
it
we
have
a
standing
army
of
men
it
is
american
tradition
that
the
financial
affairs
of
a
nation
should
be
transacted
on
the
same
principles
of
simple
honesty
that
an
individual
conducts
his
own
business
that
debt
is
a
bad
thing
and
a
man
first
surplus
earnings
should
be
applied
to
his
debts
that
offices
and
should
be
few
it
is
american
practice
that
the
general
government
should
always
have
millions
of
debt
even
if
a
panic
or
a
war
has
to
be
forced
to
prevent
its
being
paid
off
and
as
to
the
application
of
its
income
come
first
and
within
the
last
administration
it
is
reported
that
offices
have
been
created
at
an
annual
expense
of
shades
of
jefferson
how
are
vacancies
to
be
obtained
those
by
deaths
are
few
by
resignation
none
roosevelt
cuts
the
knot
by
making
new
ones
and
few
will
die
and
none
resign
they
will
beget
sons
and
daughters
and
taft
will
have
to
create
more
verily
a
simple
and
a
serviceable
thing
is
our
general
government
it
is
american
tradition
that
the
judiciary
shall
act
as
a
check
upon
the
impetuosity
of
legislatures
should
these
attempt
to
pass
the
bounds
of
constitutional
limitation
it
is
american
practice
that
the
judiciary
justifies
every
law
which
trenches
on
the
liberties
of
the
people
and
nullifies
every
act
of
the
legislature
by
which
the
people
seek
to
regain
some
measure
of
their
freedom
again
in
the
words
of
jefferson
the
constitution
is
a
mere
thing
of
wax
in
the
hands
of
the
judiciary
which
they
may
twist
and
shape
in
any
form
they
please
truly
if
the
men
who
fought
the
good
fight
for
the
triumph
of
simple
honest
free
life
in
that
day
were
now
to
look
upon
the
scene
of
their
labors
they
would
cry
out
together
with
him
who
said
i
regret
that
i
am
now
to
die
in
the
belief
that
the
useless
sacrifice
of
themselves
by
the
generation
of
to
acquire
and
happiness
to
their
country
is
to
be
thrown
away
by
the
unwise
and
unworthy
passions
of
their
sons
and
that
my
only
consolation
is
to
be
that
i
shall
not
live
to
see
it
and
now
what
has
anarchism
to
say
to
all
this
this
bankruptcy
of
republicanism
this
modern
empire
that
has
grown
up
on
the
ruins
of
our
early
freedom
we
say
this
that
the
sin
our
fathers
sinned
was
that
they
did
not
trust
liberty
wholly
they
thought
it
possible
to
compromise
between
liberty
and
government
believing
the
latter
to
be
a
necessary
evil
and
the
moment
the
compromise
was
made
the
whole
misbegotten
monster
of
our
present
tyranny
began
to
grow
instruments
which
are
set
up
to
safeguard
rights
become
the
very
whip
with
which
the
free
are
struck
anarchism
says
make
no
laws
whatever
concerning
speech
and
speech
will
be
free
so
soon
as
you
make
a
declaration
on
paper
that
speech
shall
be
free
you
will
have
a
hundred
lawyers
proving
that
freedom
does
not
mean
abuse
nor
liberty
license
and
they
will
define
and
define
freedom
out
of
existence
let
the
guarantee
of
free
speech
be
in
every
man
determination
to
use
it
and
we
shall
have
no
need
of
paper
declarations
on
the
other
hand
so
long
as
the
people
do
not
care
to
exercise
their
freedom
those
who
wish
to
tyrannize
will
do
so
for
tyrants
are
active
and
ardent
and
will
devote
themselves
in
the
name
of
any
number
of
gods
religious
and
otherwise
to
put
shackles
upon
sleeping
men
the
problem
then
becomes
is
it
possible
to
stir
men
from
their
indifference
we
have
said
that
the
spirit
of
liberty
was
nurtured
by
colonial
life
that
the
elements
of
colonial
life
were
the
desire
for
sectarian
independence
and
the
jealous
watchfulness
incident
thereto
the
isolation
of
pioneer
communities
which
threw
each
individual
strongly
on
his
own
resources
and
thus
developed
men
yet
at
the
same
time
made
very
strong
such
social
bonds
as
did
exist
and
lastly
the
comparative
simplicity
of
small
communities
all
this
has
mostly
disappeared
as
to
sectarianism
it
is
only
by
dint
of
an
occasional
idiotic
persecution
that
a
sect
becomes
interesting
in
the
absence
of
this
outlandish
sects
play
the
fool
role
are
anything
but
heroic
and
have
little
to
do
with
either
the
name
or
the
substance
of
liberty
the
old
colonial
religious
parties
have
gradually
become
the
pillars
of
society
their
animosities
have
died
out
their
offensive
peculiarities
have
been
effaced
they
are
as
like
one
another
as
beans
in
a
pod
they
build
churches
and
sleep
in
them
as
to
our
communities
they
are
hopelessly
and
helplessly
interdependent
as
we
ourselves
are
save
that
continuously
diminishing
proportion
engaged
in
all
around
farming
and
even
these
are
slaves
to
mortgages
for
our
cities
probably
there
is
not
one
that
is
provisioned
to
last
a
week
and
certainly
there
is
none
which
would
not
be
bankrupt
with
despair
at
the
proposition
that
it
produce
its
own
food
in
response
to
this
condition
and
its
correlative
political
tyranny
anarchism
affirms
the
economy
of
the
disintegration
of
the
great
communities
the
use
of
the
earth
i
am
not
ready
to
say
that
i
see
clearly
that
this
take
place
but
i
see
clearly
that
this
take
place
if
ever
again
men
are
to
be
free
i
am
so
well
satisfied
that
the
mass
of
mankind
prefer
material
possessions
to
liberty
that
i
have
no
hope
that
they
will
ever
by
means
of
intellectual
or
moral
stirrings
merely
throw
off
the
yoke
of
oppression
fastened
on
them
by
the
present
economic
system
to
institute
free
societies
my
only
hope
is
in
the
blind
development
of
the
economic
system
and
political
oppression
itself
the
great
characteristic
looming
factor
in
this
gigantic
power
is
manufacture
the
tendency
of
each
nation
is
to
become
more
and
more
a
manufacturing
one
an
exporter
of
fabrics
not
an
importer
if
this
tendency
follows
its
own
logic
it
must
eventually
circle
round
to
each
community
producing
for
itself
what
then
will
become
of
the
surplus
product
when
the
manufacturer
shall
have
no
foreign
market
why
then
mankind
must
face
the
dilemma
of
sitting
down
and
dying
in
the
midst
of
it
or
confiscating
the
goods
indeed
we
are
partially
facing
this
problem
even
now
and
so
far
we
are
sitting
down
and
dying
i
opine
however
that
men
will
not
do
it
forever
and
when
once
by
an
act
of
general
expropriation
they
have
overcome
the
reverence
and
fear
of
property
and
their
awe
of
government
they
may
waken
to
the
consciousness
that
things
are
to
be
used
and
therefore
men
are
greater
than
things
this
may
rouse
the
spirit
of
liberty
if
on
the
other
hand
the
tendency
of
invention
to
simplify
enabling
the
advantages
of
machinery
to
be
combined
with
smaller
aggregations
of
workers
shall
also
follow
its
own
logic
the
great
manufacturing
plants
will
break
up
population
will
go
after
the
fragments
and
there
will
be
seen
not
indeed
the
hard
isolated
pioneer
communities
of
early
america
but
thousands
of
small
communities
stretching
along
the
lines
of
transportation
each
producing
very
largely
for
its
own
needs
able
to
rely
upon
itself
and
therefore
able
to
be
independent
for
the
same
rule
holds
good
for
societies
as
for
individuals
those
may
be
free
who
are
able
to
make
their
own
living
in
regard
to
the
breaking
up
of
that
vilest
creation
of
tyranny
the
standing
army
and
navy
it
is
clear
that
so
long
as
men
desire
to
fight
they
will
have
armed
force
in
one
form
or
another
our
fathers
thought
they
had
guarded
against
a
standing
army
by
providing
for
the
voluntary
militia
in
our
day
we
have
lived
to
see
this
militia
declared
part
of
the
regular
military
force
of
the
united
states
and
subject
to
the
same
demands
as
the
regulars
within
another
generation
we
shall
probably
see
its
members
in
the
regular
pay
of
the
general
government
since
any
embodiment
of
the
fighting
spirit
any
military
organization
inevitably
follows
the
same
line
of
centralization
the
logic
of
anarchism
is
that
the
least
objectionable
form
of
armed
force
is
that
which
springs
up
voluntarily
like
the
of
massachusetts
and
disbands
as
soon
as
the
occasion
which
called
it
into
existence
is
past
that
the
really
desirable
thing
is
that
all
men
not
americans
only
should
be
at
peace
and
that
to
reach
this
all
peaceful
persons
should
withdraw
their
support
from
the
army
and
require
that
all
who
make
war
shall
do
so
at
their
own
cost
and
risk
that
neither
pay
nor
pensions
are
to
be
provided
for
those
who
choose
to
make
a
trade
as
to
the
american
tradition
of
anarchism
asks
that
it
be
carried
down
to
the
individual
himself
it
demands
no
jealous
barrier
of
isolation
it
knows
that
such
isolation
is
undesirable
and
impossible
but
it
teaches
that
by
all
men
strictly
minding
their
own
business
a
fluid
society
freely
adapting
itself
to
mutual
needs
wherein
all
the
world
shall
belong
to
all
men
as
much
as
each
has
need
or
desire
will
result
and
when
modern
revolution
has
thus
been
carried
to
the
heart
of
the
whole

anarchism
in

in
the
long
sweep
of
seventeen
hundred
years
which
witnessed
the
engulfment
of
a
moribund
roman
civilization
together
with
its
borrowed
greek
ideals
under
the
red
tide
of
a
passionate
barbarism
that
leaped
to
embrace
the
idea
of
triumph
over
death
and
spat
upon
the
grecian
joys
of
life
with
the
superb
contempt
of
the

was

and

it
boots
not
here
to
inquire
how
close
or
how
remote
the
christian
ideal
as
it
developed
was
in
comparison
with
the
teachings
of
the
nazarene
distorted
blackened
almost
effaced
it
was
yet
some
faint
echo
from
the
hillsides
of

some
indistinct
vision
of
the
cross
some
dull
perception
of
the
white
glory
of
renunciation
that
shaped
the

of
the
evolving
barbarian
and
moulded
all
his
work
whether
of
stone
or
clay
upon
canvas
or

wherever
we
turn
we
find
a
general
fixup
or
caste
an

unquestioning

hardly

a

heavily
upon
the

is

any
it

it

deeper
or
it

it

is
not

to

with

his

is
for
anarchism
means
fulness
of
being
it
means
the
return
of
greek
radiance
of
life
greek
love
of
beauty
without
greek
indifference
to
the
common
man
it
means
christian
earnestness
and
christian
communism
without
christian
fanaticism
and
christian
gloom
and
tyranny
it
means
this
because
it
means
perfect
freedom
material
and
spiritual
freedom
the
light
of
greek
idealism
failed
because
with
all
its
love
of
life
and
the
infinite
diversity
of
beauty
and
all
the
glory
of
its
free
intellect
it
never
conceived
of
material
freedom
to
it
the
helot
was
as
eternal
as
the
gods
therefore
the
gods
passed
away
and
their
eternity
was
as
a
little
wave
of
time
the
christian
ideal
has
failed
because
with
all
its
sublime
communism
its
doctrine
of
universal
equality
it
was
bound
up
with
a
spiritual
tyranny
seeking
to
mould
into
one
pattern
the
thoughts
of
all
humanity
stamping
all
men
with
the
stamp
of
submission
throwing
upon
all
the
dark
umber
of
lived
for
the
purpose
of
and
fruitful
of
all
other
tyrannies
anarchism
will
succeed
because
its
message
of
freedom
comes
down
the
rising
wind
of
social
revolt
first
of
all
to
the
common
man
the
material
slave
and
bids
him
know
that
he
too
should
have
an
independent
will
and
the
free
exercise
thereof
that
no
philosophy
and
no
achievement
and
no
civilization
is
worth
considering
or
achieving
if
it
does
not
mean
that
he
shall
be
free
to
labor
at
what
he
likes
and
when
he
likes
and
freely
share
all
that
free
men
choose
to
produce
that
he
the
drudge
of
all
the
ages
is
the
cornerstone
of
the
building
without
whose
sure
and
safe
position
no
structure
can
nor
should
endure
and
likewise
it
comes
to
him
who
sits
in
fear
of
himself
and
says
fear
no
more
neither
what
is
without
or
within
search
fully
and
freely
your
self
hearken
to
all
the
voices
that
rise
from
that
abyss
from
which
you
have
been
commanded
to
shrink
learn
for
yourself
what
these
things
are
belike
what
they
have
told
you
is
good
is
bad
and
this
cast
mould
of
goodness
a
vile
learn
to
decide
your
own
measure
of
restraint
value
for
yourself
the
merits
of
selfishness
and
unselfishness
and
strike
you
the
balance
between
these
two
for
if
the
first
be
all
accredited
you
make
slaves
of
others
and
if
the
second
your
own
abasement
raises
tyrants
over
you
and
none
can
decide
the
matter
for
you
so
well
as
you
for
yourself
for
even
if
you
err
you
learn
by
it
while
if
he
errs
the
blame
is
his
and
if
he
advises
well
the
credit
is
his
and
you
are
nothing
and
by
learn
the
wisdom
of
the
ages
lies
in
the
reassertion
of
all
past
positivisms
and
the
denial
of
all
negations
that
is
all
that
has
been
claimed
by
the
individual
for
himself
is
good
but
every
denial
of
the
freedom
of
another
is
bad
whereby
it
will
be
seen
that
many
things
supposed
to
be
claimed
for
oneself
involve
the
freedom
of
others
and
must
be
surrendered
because
they
do
not
come
within
the
sovereign
limit
while
many
things
supposed
to
be
evil
since
they
in
nowise
infringe
upon
the
liberty
of
others
are
wholly
good
bringing
to
dwarfed
bodies
and
narrow
souls
the
vigor
and
full
growth
of
healthy
exercise
and
giving
a
rich
glow
to
life
that
had
else
paled
out
like
a
lamp
in
a
to
the
sybarite
it
says
learn
to
do
your
own
share
of
hard
work
you
will
gain
by
it
to
the
man
with
the
hoe
think
for
yourself
and
boldly
take
your
time
for
it
the
division
of
labor
which
makes
of
one
man
a
brain
and
of
another
a
hand
is
evil
away
with
it
this
is
the
ethical
gospel
of
anarchism
to
which
these
three
hundred
years
of
intellectual
ferment
have
been
leading
he
who
will
trace
the
course
of
literature
for
three
hundred
years
will
find
innumerable
bits
of
drift
here
and
there
indicative
of
the
moral
and
intellectual
revolt
protestantism
itself
in
asserting
the
supremacy
of
the
individual
conscience
fired
the
long
train
of
thought
which
inevitably
leads
to
the
explosion
of
all
forms
of
authority
the
great
political
writers
of
the
eighteenth
century
in
asserting
the
right
of
carried
the
line
of
advance
one
step
further
america
had
her
jefferson
declaring
societies
exist
under
three
forms
without
government
as
among
the
indians
under
governments
wherein
every
one
has
a
just
influence
under
governments
of
force
it
is
a
problem
not
clear
in
my
mind
that
the
first
condition
is
not
the
best
she
had
or
she
and
england
together
had
her
paine
more
mildly
asserting
governments
are
at
best
a
necessary
evil
and
england
had
also
godwin
who
though
still
milder
in
manner
and
consequently
less
effective
during
the
troublous
period
in
which
he
lived
was
nevertheless
more
deeply
radical
than
either
presaging
that
application
of
the
political
ideal
to
economic
concerns
so
distinctive
of
modern
anarchism
my
neighbor
says
he
has
just
as
much
right
to
put
an
end
to
my
existence
with
dagger
or
poison
as
to
deny
me
that
pecuniary
assistance
without
which
i
must
starve
nor
did
he
stop
here
he
carried
the
logic
of
individual
sovereignty
into
the
chiefest
of
social
institutions
and
declared
that
the
sex
relation
was
a
matter
concerning
the
individuals
sharing
it
only
thus
he
says
the
institution
of
marriage
is
a
system
of
fraud
marriage
is
law
and
the
worst
of
all
laws
marriage
is
an
affair
of
property
and
the
worst
of
all
properties
so
long
as
two
human
beings
are
forbidden
by
positive
institution
to
follow
the
dictates
of
their
own
mind
prejudice
is
alive
and
vigorous
the
abolition
of
marriage
will
be
attended
with
no
evils
we
are
apt
to
consider
it
to
ourselves
as
the
harbinger
of
brutal
lust
and
depravity
but
it
really
happens
in
this
as
in
other
cases
that
the
positive
laws
which
are
made
to
restrain
our
vices
irritate
and
multiply
them
the
grave
and
judicial
style
of
political
justice
prevented
its
attaining
the
great
popularity
of
the
rights
of
man
but
the
indirect
influence
of
its
author
bloomed
in
the
rich
profusion
of
shelleyan
fancy
and
in
all
that
coterie
of
young
litterateurs
who
gathered
about
godwin
as
their
revered
teacher
nor
was
the
principle
of
without
its
vindication
from
one
who
moved
actively
in
official
centers
and
whose
name
has
been
alternately
quoted
by
conservatives
and
radicals
now
with
veneration
now
with
execration
in
his
essay
on
government
edmund
burke
the
great
political
weathercock
aligned
himself
with
the
germinating
movement
towards
anarchism
when
he
exclaimed
they
talk
of
the
abuse
of
government
the
thing
the
thing
itself
is
the
abuse
this
aphoristic
utterance
will
go
down
in
history
on
its
own
merits
as
the
sayings
of
great
men
often
do
stripped
of
its
accompanying
explanations
men
have
already
forgotten
to
inquire
how
and
why
he
said
it
the
words
stand
and
will
continue
a
living
message
long
after
the
thousands
of
sheets
of
rhetoric
which
won
him
the
epithet
of
the
of
the
house
have
been
relegated
to
the
dust
of
museums
in
later
days
an
essayist
whose
brilliancy
of
style
and
capacity
for
getting
on
all
sides
of
a
question
connect
him
with
burke
in
some
manner
as
his
spiritual
offspring
has
furnished
the
anarchists
with
one
of
their
most
frequent
quotations
in
his
essay
on
john
milton
macaulay
declares
the
only
cure
for
the
evils
of
newly
acquired
liberty
is
more
liberty
that
he
nevertheless
possessed
a
strong
vein
of
conservatism
sat
in
parliament
and
took
part
in
legal
measures
simply
proves
that
he
had
his
tether
and
could
not
go
the
length
of
his
own
logic
that
is
no
reason
others
should
not
the
anarchists
accept
this
fundamental
declaration
and
proceed
to
its
consequence
but
the
was
making
way
not
only
in
england
where
indeed
constitutional
phlegmatism
though
stirred
beyond
its
wont
by
the
events
of
the
close
of
the
last
century
acted
frigidly
upon
it
but
throughout
europe
in
france
rabelais
drew
the
idyllic
picture
of
the
abbey
of
thelemes
a
community
of
persons
agreeing
to
practise
complete
individual
freedom
among
themselves
rousseau
however
erroneous
his
basis
for
the
social
contract
moved
all
he
touched
with
his
belief
that
humanity
was
innately
good
and
capable
of
so
manifesting
itself
in
the
absence
of
restrictions
furthermore
his
confessions
appears
the
most
famous
of
the
tendency
now
shaping
itself
in
literature
that
of
the
free
expression
of
a
whole
man
not
in
his
only
but
in
his
not
in
his
decent
scrubbed
and
polished
moral
clothes
alone
but
in
his
vileness
and
his
meanness
and
his
folly
too
these
being
indisputable
factors
in
his
moral
life
and
no
solution
but
a
false
one
to
be
obtained
by
hiding
them
and
playing
they
are
not
there
this
truth
acknowledged
in
america
in
our
own
times
by
two
powerful
writers
of
very
different
cast
is
being
approached
by
all
the
manifold
paths
of
the
soul
travel
i
have
in
me
the
capacity
for
every
crime
says
emerson
the
transcendentalist
and
whitman
the
stanch
proclaimer
of
blood
and
sinew
and
the
gospel
of
the
holiness
of
the
body
makes
himself
one
with
drunken
revelers
and
the
creatures
of
debauchery
as
well
as
with
the
anchorite
and
the
that
fulness
of
being
may
be
declared
in
the
genesis
of
these
declarations
we
shall
find
the
confessions
it
is
not
the
social
contract
alone
that
is
open
to
the
criticism
of
having
reasoned
from
false
premises
all
the
early
political
writers
we
have
named
were
equally
mistaken
all
suffering
from
a
like
insufficiency
of
facts
partly
this
was
the
result
of
the
habit
of
thought
fostered
by
the
church
for
seventeen
hundred
years
which
habit
was
to
accept
by
faith
a
sweeping
generalization
and
fit
all
future
discoveries
of
fact
into
it
but
partly
also
it
is
in
the
nature
of
all
idealism
to
offer
itself
however
vaguely
in
the
mist
of
and
allow
time
to
correct
and
sharpen
the
detail
probably
initial
steps
will
always
be
taken
with
blunders
while
those
who
are
not
imaginative
enough
to
perceive
the
figure
will
nevertheless
accept
it
later
and
set
it
upon
a
firm
foundation
this
has
been
the
task
of
the
modern
historian
who
no
less
than
the
political
writer
consciously
or
unconsciously
is
swayed
by
the
anarchistic
ideal
and
bends
his
services
towards
it
it
is
understood
that
when
we
speak
of
history
we
do
not
allude
to
the
unspeakable
trash
contained
in
public
school
which
in
general
resemble
a
cellar
of
chronologies
epaulettes
bad
drawings
and
silly
tales
and
are
a
striking
instance
of
the
corrupting
influence
of
state
management
of
education
by
which
the
mediocre
nay
the
absolutely
empty
is
made
to
survive
history
which
is
undertaken
with
the
purpose
of
discovering
the
real
course
of
the
development
of
human
society
among
such
efforts
the
broken
but
splendid
fragment
of
his
stupendous
project
is
buckle
history
of
civilization
a
work
in
which
the
author
breaks
away
utterly
from
the
old
method
of
history
writing
viz
that
of
recording
court
intrigues
the
doings
of
individuals
in
power
as
a
matter
of
personal
interest
the
processions
of
military
pageant
to
inquire
into
the
real
lives
and
conditions
of
the
people
to
trace
their
great
upheavals
and
in
what
consisted
their
progress
gervinus
in
germany
who
within
only
recent
years
drew
upon
himself
a
prosecution
for
treason
took
a
like
method
and
declared
that
progress
consists
in
a
steady
decline
of
centralized
power
and
the
development
of
local
autonomy
and
the
free
federation
supplementing
the
work
of
the
historian
proper
there
has
arisen
a
new
class
of
literature
itself
the
creation
of
the
spirit
of
free
inquiry
since
up
till
that
had
asserted
itself
such
writings
were
impossible
it
embraces
a
wide
range
of
studies
into
the
conditions
and
psychology
of
prehistoric
man
of
which
sir
john
lubbock
works
will
serve
as
the
type
from
these
dark
as
the
subject
yet
is
we
are
learning
the
true
sources
of
all
authority
and
the
agencies
which
are
rendering
it
obsolete
moreover
a
curious
cycle
of
development
reveals
itself
namely
that
starting
from
the
point
of
no
authority
unconsciously
accepted
man
in
the
several
manifestations
of
his
activity
evolves
through
stages
of
belief
in
many
authorities
to
one
authority
and
finally
to
again
but
this
time
conscious
and
reasoned
crowning
the
work
of
historian
and
prehistorian
comes
the
labor
of
the
sociologist
herbert
spencer
with
infinite
patience
for
detail
and
marvelous
power
of
classification
and
generalization
takes
up
the
facts
of
the
others
and
deduces
from
them
the
great
law
of
equal
freedom
a
man
should
have
the
freedom
to
do
whatsoever
he
wills
provided
that
in
the
doing
thereof
he
infringes
not
the
equal
freedom
of
every
other
man
the
early
edition
of
social
statics
is
a
logical
scientific
and
bold
statement
of
the
great
fundamental
freedoms
which
anarchists
demand
from
the
rather
taxing
study
of
authors
like
these
it
is
a
relief
to
turn
to
those
intermediate
writers
who
dwell
between
them
and
the
pure
fictionists
whose
writings
are
occupied
with
the
facts
of
life
as
related
to
the
affections
and
aspirations
of
humanity
among
whom
representative
men
we
immediately
select
emerson
thoreau
edward
carpenter
now
indeed
we
cease
to
reason
upon
the
past
evolution
of
liberty
and
begin
to
feel
it
begin
to
reach
out
after
what
it
mean
none
who
are
familiar
with
the
thought
of
emerson
can
fail
to
recognize
that
it
is
spiritual
anarchism
from
the
serene
heights
of
the
ego
looks
out
upon
its
possibilities
unawed
by
aught
without
and
he
who
has
dwelt
in
dream
by
walden
charmed
by
that
pure
life
he
has
not
himself
led
but
wished
that
like
thoreau
he
might
lead
has
felt
that
call
of
the
anarchistic
ideal
which
pleads
with
men
to
renounce
the
worthless
luxuries
which
enslave
them
and
those
who
work
for
them
that
the
buried
soul
which
is
doomed
to
mummy
cloths
by
the
rush
and
jangle
of
the
chase
for
wealth
may
answer
the
still
small
voice
of
the
resurrection
there
in
the
silence
the
solitude
the
simplicity
of
the
free
life
a
similar
note
is
sounded
in
carpenter
civilization
its
cause
and
cure
a
work
which
is
likely
to
make
the
civilizer
see
himself
in
a
very
different
light
than
that
in
which
he
usually
beholds
himself
and
again
the
same
vibration
shudders
through
the
city
of
dreadful
night
the
masterpiece
of
an
obscure
genius
who
was
at
once
essayist
and
poet
of
too
high
and
rare
a
quality
to
catch
the
ear
stunned
by
strident
commonplaces
but
loved
by
all
who
seek
the
violets
of
the
soul
one
thomson
known
to
literature
as
similarly
obscure
and
similarly
sympathetic
is
the
english
peasant
by
richard
heath
a
collection
of
essays
so
redolent
of
abounding
love
so
overflowing
with
understanding
for
characters
utterly
contradictory
painted
so
tenderly
and
yet
so
strongly
that
none
can
read
them
without
realizing
that
here
is
a
man
who
whatever
he
he
believes
in
reality
desires
freedom
of
expression
for
the
whole
human
spirit
which
implies
for
every
separate
unit
of
it
something
of
the
emersonian
striving
after
individual
attainment
plus
the
passionate
sympathy
of
heath
is
found
in
a
remarkable
book
which
is
too
good
to
have
obtained
a
popular
hearing
entitled
the
story
of
my
heart
no
more
daring
utterance
was
ever
given
voice
than
this
i
pray
to
find
the
highest
soul
greater
than
deity
better
than
god
in
the
concluding
pages
of
the
tenth
chapter
of
this
wonderful
little
book
occur
the
following
lines
that
any
human
being
should
dare
to
apply
to
another
the
epithet
of
is
to
me
the
greatest
the
vilest
the
most
unpardonable
crime
that
could
be
committed
each
human
being
by
mere
birth
has
a
birthright
in
this
earth
and
all
its
productions
and
if
they
do
not
receive
it
then
it
is
they
who
are
injured
and
it
is
not
the
oh
inexpressibly
wicked
world
it
is
the
who
are
the
criminals
it
matters
not
in
the
least
if
the
poor
be
improvident
drunken
or
evil
in
any
way
food
and
drink
roof
and
clothes
are
the
inalienable
right
of
every
child
born
into
the
light
if
the
world
does
not
provide
it
freely
not
as
a
grudging
gift
but
as
a
right
as
the
son
of
the
house
sits
down
to
breakfast
then
is
the
world
mad
but
the
world
is
not
mad
only
in
ignorance
in
catholic
sympathy
like
this
in
after
a
wider
righteousness
a
higher
idea
than
god
does
the
anarchistic
ideal
come
to
those
who
have
lived
through
old
phases
of
religious
and
social
beliefs
and
found
them
wanting
it
is
the
shelleyan
outburst
more
life
and
fuller
life
we
want
was
the
prometheus
of
the
movement
he
the
wild
bird
of
song
who
flew
down
into
the
heart
of
storm
and
night
singing
unutterably
sweet
the
song
of
the
free
man
and
woman
as
he
passed
poor
shelley
happy
shelley
he
died
not
knowing
the
triumph
of
his
genius
but
also
he
died
while
the
white
glow
within
was
yet
shining
higher
higher
in
the
light
of
it
he
smiled
above
the
world
had
he
lived
he
might
have
died
alive
as
swinburne
and
as
tennyson
whose
old
days
belie
their
early
strength
yet
men
will
remember
slowly
comes
a
hungry
people
as
a
lion
drawing
nigher
glares
at
one
who
nods
and
winks
beside
a
slowly
dying
fire
and
let
the
great
world
swing
forever
down
the
ringing
grooves
of
change
and
glory
to
man
in
the
highest
for
man
is
the
master
of
things
and
while

hold
together
the

are
less

until
the
end
of

and
of

though
their
authors
take
refuge
in
the
kingdom
and
quaver
palsied
hymns
to
royalty
with
their
cracked
voices
and
broken
lutes
for
this
is
the
glory
of
the
living
ideal
that
all
that
is
in
accord
with
it
lives
whether
the
mouthpiece
through
which
it
spoke
would
recall

accepting

rules
as
to
the
conventional
plot
but
having
to
do
with
serious
questions
of
the
lives
of
the
plain
people
holds
ever
before
us
the
supreme
duty
of
truth
to
inner
being
in
defiance
of
custom
and
law
it
is
so
in
nora
who
renounces
all
notions
of
family
duty
to
find
herself
it
is
so
in
stockman
who
maintains
the
rectitude
of
his
own
soul
against
the
authorities
and
against
the
mob
it
should
have
been
so
in
alving
who
learns
too
late
that
her
yielding
to
social
custom
has
brought
a
life
into
the
world
besides
wrecking
her
own
the
master
builder
john
gabriel
borkman
all
his
characters
are
created
to
vindicate
the
separate
soul
supreme
within
its
sphere
those
that
are
miserable
and
in
evil
condition
are
so
because
they
have
not
lived
true
to
themselves
but
in
obedience
to
some
social
hypocrisy
gerhart
hauptmann
likewise
feels
the
new
pulsation
he
has
no
hero
no
heroine
no
intrigue
his
picture
is
the
image
of
the
headless
and
tailless
body
of
struggle
the
struggle
of
the
common
man
it
begins
in
the
middle
it
ends
in
nothing
as
yet
to
end
in
defeat
would
be
to
premise
surrender
a
surrender
humanity
does
not
intend
to
triumph
would
be
to
anticipate
the
future
and
paint
life
other
than
it
is
hence
it
ends
where
it
began
in
murmurs
thus
his
weavers
octave
mirbeau
likewise
offers
his
criticism
on
a
world
of
sheep
in
the
bad
shepherds
and
sara
bernhardt
plays
it
in
england
and
america
we
have
another
phase
of
the
rebel
drama
the
drama
of
the
bad
woman
as
a
distinct
figure
in
social
creation
with
a
right
to
be
herself
have
we
not
the
second
tanqueray
who
comes
to
grief
through
an
endeavor
to
conform
to
a
moral
standard
that
does
not
fit
and
have
we
not
zaza
who
is
worth
a
thousand
of
her
respectable
lover
and
his
respectable
wife
and
does
not
all
the
audience
go
home
in
love
with
her
and
begin
to
quest
the
libraries
for
literary
justifications
of
their
preference
and
these
are
not
hard
to
find
for
it
is
in
the
novel
particularly
the
novel
which
is
the
special
creation
of
the
last
century
that
the
new
ideal
is
freest
in
a
recent
essay
in
reply
to
walter
besant
henry
james
pleads
most
anarchistically
for
his
freedom
in
the
novel
all
such
pleas
will
always
come
as
justifications
for
as
to
the
freedom
it
is
already
won
and
all
the
formalists
from
besant
to
the
end
of
days
will
never
tempt
the
litterateurs
into
chains
again
but
the
essay
is
well
worth
reading
as
a
specimen
of
right
reasoning
on
art
as
in
other
modes
of
literary
expression
this
tendency
in
the
novel
dates
back
and
it
is
strange
enough
that
out
of
the
mouth
of
a
toady
like
walter
scott
should
have
spoken
the
free
outlaw
spirit
read
notably
quentin
durward
which
is
perhaps
the
first
phase
of
that
has
the
initial
strength
to
declare
itself
against
the
tyranny
of
custom
this
is
why
it
happens
that
the
of
social
change
are
often
shocking
in
their
rudeness
and
contempt
of
manners
and
in
fact
more
or
less
uncomfortable
persons
to
have
to
do
with
but
they
have
their
irresistible
charm
all
the
same
and
scott
who
was
a
true
genius
despite
his
toadyism
felt
it
and
responded
to
it
by
always
making
us
love
his
outlaws
best
no
matter
how
gently
he
dealt
with
kings
another
phase
of
the
free
man
appears
in
george
rollicking
gypsies
who
do
not
take
the
trouble
to
despise
law
but
simply
ignore
it
live
unconscious
of
it
altogether
george
meredith
in
another
vein
develops
the
strong
soul
social
barriers
our
own
hawthorne
in
his
preface
to
the
scarlet
letter
and
still
more
in
the
marble
faun
depicts
the
vacuity
of
a
life
sucking
a
parasitic
existence
through
government
organization
and
asserts
over
and
over
that
the
only
strength
is
in
him
or
her
and
it
is
noteworthy
that
the
strongest
is
in
her
who
resolutely
chooses
and
treads
an
unbeaten
path
from
far
away
africa
there
speaks
again
the
note
of
soul
rebellion
in
the
exquisite
dreams
of
olive
schreiner
wherethrough
hunter
walks
grant
allen
too
in
numerous
works
especially
the
woman
who
did

demand
for

gives
us
his
idyllic
news
from
nowhere
zola
the
fertile
creator
of
dungheaps
crowned
with
lilies
whose
pages
reek
with
the
stench
of
bodies
laboring
debauching
rotting
until
the
words
of
christ
cry
loud
in
the
ears
of
him
who
would
put
the
vision
away
whited
sepulchres
full
of
dead
men
bones
and
all
uncleanliness
zola
was
more
than
an
unconscious
anarchist
he
is
a
conscious
one

so
proclaim
himself
and
close
beside
him
maxim

spokesman
of
the
tramp
visionary
of
the
despised
who
whatever
his
personal
political
views
may
be
and
notwithstanding
the
condemnations
he
has
visited
upon
the
anarchist
is
still
an
anarchistic
voice
in
literature
and
over
against
these
austere
simple
but
oh
so
loving
the
critic
who
shows
the
world
its
faults
but
does
not
condemn
the
man
who
first
took
the
way
of
renunciation
and
then
it
the
christian
whom
the
church
casts
out
the
anarchist
whom
the
worst
government
in
the
world
dares
not
slay
the
author
of
resurrection
and
the
slavery
of
our
times
they
come
together
from
the
side
of
passionate
hate
and
limitless
love
the
volcano
and
the
sea
they
come
together
in
one
demand
freedom
from
this
wicked
and
debasing
tyranny
called
government
which
makes
indescribable
brutes
of
all
who
feel
its
touch
but
worse
still
of
all
who
touch
it
as
for
contemporaneous
light
literature
there
are
magazine
articles
and
papers
innumerable
displaying
here
and
there
the
grasp
of
the
idea
have
we
not

proclaiming
in
anarchistic
spelling

am

anarkist

the
way

now
expect
a
visitation
of
the
criminal
anarchy

years
since
julian

writing
in

you
ever
notice

let
two
names
standing
for
strangely
opposing
appeals

standing
upon
common

close
this
sketch
two
strong
flashes
of
the
prismatic
fires
which
blent
together
in
the
white
ray
of
our
ideal
the
first
nietzsche
he
who
proclaims
the
overman
the
receiver
of
the
mantle
of
max
stirner
the
scintillant
rhetorician
the
pride
of
young
germany
who
would
have
the
individual
acknowledge
nothing
neither
science
nor
logic
nor
any
other
creation
of
his
thought
as
having
authority
over
him
its
creator
the
last
whitman
the
great
sympathetic
quaker
whose
love
knew
no
limits
who
said
to
society
most
utterly
despised
outcast
not
until
the
sun
excludes
you
will
i
exclude
you
and
who
whether
he
be
called
poet
philosopher
or
peasant
was
supremely
anarchist
and
in
a
moment
of
weariness
with
human
slavery
cried
i
think
i
could
turn
and
live
with
animals
they
seem
so
placid
and
i
stand
and
look
at
them
long
and
long
they
do
not
sweat
and
whine
about
their
conditions
they
do
not
lie
awake
in
the
dark
and
weep
for
their
sins
they
do
not
make
me
sick
discussing
their
duty
to
god
not
one
is
dissatisfied
not
one
is
demented
with
the
mania
of
owning
things
not
one
kneels
to
another
nor
to
his
kind
that
lived
thousands
of
years
ago
not
one
is
respectable
or
unhappy
over
the
whole
earth
the
making
of
an
anarchist
here
was
one
guard
and
here
was
the
other
at
this
end
i
was
here
opposite
the
gate
you
know
those
problems
in
geometry
of
the
hare
and
the
hounds
they
never
run
straight
but
always
in
a
curve
so
see
and
the
guard
was
no
smarter
than
the
dogs
if
he
had
run
straight
to
the
gate
he
would
have
caught
me
it
was
peter
kropotkin
telling
of
his
escape
from
the
fortress
three
crumbs
on
the
table
marked
the
relative
position
of
the
outwitted
guards
and
the
fugitive
prisoner
the
speaker
had
broken
them
from
the
bread
on
which
he
was
lunching
and
dropped
them
on
the
table
with
an
amused
smile
the
suggested
triangle
had
been
the
of
the
exile
of
the
greatest
man
save
tolstoy
alone
that
russia
has
produced
from
that
moment
began
the
many
foreign
wanderings
and
the
taking
of
the
simple
title
comrade
for
which
he
had
abandoned
the
prince
which
he
despises
we
were
three
together
in
the
plain
little
home
of
a
london
workingman
will
wess
a
shoemaker
kropotkin
and
i
we
had
our
tea
in
homely
english
fashion
with
thin
slices
of
buttered
bread
and
we
talked
of
things
nearest
our
hearts
which
whenever
two
or
three
anarchists
are
gathered
together
means
present
evidences
of
the
growth
of
liberty
and
what
our
comrades
are
doing
in
all
lands
and
as
what
they
do
and
say
often
leads
them
into
prisons
the
talk
had
naturally
fallen
upon
kropotkin
experience
and
his
daring
escape
for
which
the
russian
government
is
chagrined
unto
this
day
presently
the
old
man
glanced
at
the
time
and
jumped
briskly
to
his
feet
i
am
late
voltairine
will
is
this
the
way
to
the
kitchen
i
must
say
to
turner
and
lizzie
and
out
to
the
kitchen
he
went
unwilling
late
though
he
was
to
leave
without
a
to
those
who
had
so
much
as
washed
a
dish
for
him
such
is
kropotkin
a
man
whose
personality
is
felt
more
than
any
other
in
the
anarchist
movement
at
once
the
gentlest
the
most
kindly
and
the
most
invincible
of
men
communist
as
well
as
anarchist
his
very
are
rhythmic
with
the
great
common
pulse
of
work
and
life
communist
am
not
i
though
my
father
was
and
his
father
before
him
during
the
stirring
times
of
which
is
probably
the
remote
reason
for
my
opposition
to
things
as
they
are
at
bottom
convictions
are
mostly
temperamental
and
if
i
sought
to
explain
myself
on
other
grounds
i
should
be
a
bewildering
error
in
logic
for
by
early
influences
and
education
i
should
have
been
a
nun
and
spent
my
life
glorifying
authority
in
its
most
concentrated
form
as
some
of
my
schoolmates
are
doing
at
this
hour
within
the
mission
houses
of
the
order
of
the
holy
names
of
jesus
and
mary
but
the
old
ancestral
spirit
of
rebellion
asserted
itself
while
i
was
yet
fourteen
a
schoolgirl
at
the
convent
of
our
lady
of
lake
huron
at
sarnia
ontario
how
i
pity
myself
now
when
i
remember
it
poor
lonesome
little
soul
battling
solitary
in
the
murk
of
religious
superstition
unable
to
believe
and
yet
in
hourly
fear
of
damnation
hot
savage
and
eternal
if
i
do
not
instantly
confess
and
profess
how
well
i
recall
the
bitter
energy
with
which
i
repelled
my
teacher
enjoinder
when
i
told
her
that
i
did
not
wish
to
apologize
for
an
adjudged
fault
as
i
could
not
see
that
i
had
been
wrong
and
would
not
my
words
it
is
not
necessary
said
she
that
we
should
feel
what
we
say
but
it
is
always
necessary
that
we
obey
our
superiors
i
will
not
lie
i
answered
hotly
and
at
the
same
time
trembled
lest
my
disobedience
had
finally
consigned
me
to
torment
i
struggled
my
way
out
at
last
and
was
a
freethinker
when
i
left
the
institution
three
years
later
though
i
had
never
seen
a
book
or
heard
a
word
to
help
me
in
my
loneliness
it
had
been
like
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
and
there
are
white
scars
on
my
soul
yet
where
ignorance
and
superstition
burnt
me
with
their
in
those
stifling
days
am
i
blasphemous
it
is
their
word
not
mine
beside
that
battle
of
my
young
days
all
others
have
been
easy
for
whatever
was
without
within
my
own
will
was
supreme
it
has
owed
no
allegiance
and
never
shall
it
has
moved
steadily
in
one
direction
the
knowledge
and
the
assertion
of
its
own
liberty
with
all
the
responsibility
falling
thereon
this
i
am
sure
is
the
ultimate
reason
for
my
acceptance
of
anarchism
though
the
specific
occasion
which
ripened
tendencies
to
definition
was
the
affair
of
when
five
innocent
men
were
hanged
in
chicago
for
the
act
of
one
guilty
who
still
remains
unknown
till
then
i
believed
in
the
essential
justice
of
the
american
law
and
trial
by
jury
after
that
i
never
could
the
infamy
of
that
trial
has
passed
into
history
and
the
question
it
awakened
as
to
the
possibility
of
justice
under
law
has
passed
into
clamorous
crying
across
the
world
with
this
question
fighting
for
a
hearing
at
a
time
when
young
and
ardent
all
questions
were
pressing
with
a
force
which
later
life
would
in
vain
hear
again
i
chanced
to
attend
a
paine
memorial
convention
in
an
corner
of
the
earth
among
the
mountains
and
the
of
pennsylvania
i
was
a
freethought
lecturer
at
this
time
and
had
spoken
in
the
afternoon
on
the
lifework
of
paine
in
the
evening
i
sat
in
the
audience
to
hear
clarence
darrow
deliver
an
address
on
socialism
it
was
my
first
introduction
to
any
plan
for
bettering
the
condition
of
the
which
furnished
some
explanation
of
the
course
of
economic
development
and
i
ran
to
it
as
one
who
has
been
turning
about
in
darkness
runs
to
the
light
i
smile
now
at
how
quickly
i
adopted
the
label
socialist
and
how
quickly
i
cast
it
aside
let
no
one
follow
my
example
but
i
was
young
six
weeks
later
i
was
punished
for
my
rashness
when
i
attempted
to
argue
for
my
faith
with
a
little
russian
jew
named
mozersky
at
a
debating
club
in
pittsburgh
he
was
an
anarchist
and
a
bit
of
a
socrates
he
questioned
me
into
all
kinds
of
holes
from
which
i
extricated
myself
most
awkwardly
only
to
flounder
into
others
he
had
smilingly
dug
while
i
was
getting
out
of
the
first
ones
the
necessity
of
a
better
foundation
became
apparent
hence
began
a
course
of
study
in
the
principles
of
sociology
and
of
modern
socialism
and
anarchism
as
presented
in
their
regular
journals
it
was
benjamin
tucker
the
exponent
of
individualist
anarchism
which
finally
convinced
me
that
liberty
is
not
the
daughter
but
the
mother
of
order
and
though
i
no
longer
hold
the
particular
economic
gospel
advocated
by
tucker
the
doctrine
of
anarchism
itself
as
then
conceived
has
but
broadened
deepened
and
intensified
itself
with
years
to
those
unfamiliar
with
the
movement
the
various
terms
are
confusing
anarchism
is
in
truth
a
sort
of
protestantism
whose
adherents
are
a
unit
in
the
great
essential
belief
that
all
forms
of
external
authority
must
disappear
to
be
replaced
by
only
but
variously
divided
in
our
conception
of
the
form
of
future
society
individualism
supposes
private
property
to
be
the
cornerstone
of
personal
freedom
asserts
that
such
property
should
consist
in
the
absolute
possession
of
one
own
product
and
of
such
share
of
the
natural
heritage
of
all
as
one
may
actually
use
on
the
other
hand
declares
that
such
property
is
both
unrealizable
and
undesirable
that
the
common
possession
and
use
of
all
the
natural
sources
and
means
of
social
production
can
alone
guarantee
the
individual
against
a
recurrence
of
inequality
and
its
attendants
government
and
slavery
my
personal
conviction
is
that
both
forms
of
society
as
well
as
many
intermediations
would
in
the
absence
of
government
be
tried
in
various
localities
according
to
the
instincts
and
material
condition
of
the
people
but
that
well
founded
objections
may
be
offered
to
both
liberty
and
experiment
alone
can
determine
the
best
forms
of
society
therefore
i
no
longer
label
myself
otherwise
than
as
anarchist
simply
i
would
not
however
have
the
world
think
that
i
am
an
anarchist
by
trade
outsiders
have
some
very
curious
notions
about
us
one
of
them
being
that
anarchists
never
work
on
the
contrary
anarchists
are
nearly
always
poor
and
it
is
only
the
rich
who
live
without
work
not
only
this
but
it
is
our
belief
that
every
healthy
human
being
will
by
the
laws
of
his
own
activity
choose
to
work
though
certainly
not
as
now
for
at
present
there
is
little
opportunity
for
one
to
find
his
true
vocation
thus
i
who
in
freedom
would
have
selected
otherwise
am
a
teacher
of
language
some
twelve
years
since
being
in
philadelphia
and
without
employment
i
accepted
the
proposition
of
a
small
group
of
russian
jewish
factory
workers
to
form
an
evening
class
in
the
common
english
branches
i
know
well
enough
that
behind
the
desire
to
help
me
to
make
a
living
lay
the
wish
that
i
might
thus
take
part
in
the
propaganda
of
our
common
cause
but
the
incidental
became
once
more
the
principal
and
a
teacher
of
working
men
and
women
i
have
remained
from
that
day
in
those
twelve
years
that
i
have
lived
and
loved
and
worked
with
foreign
jews
i
have
taught
over
a
thousand
and
found
them
as
a
rule
the
brightest
the
most
persistent
and
sacrificing
students
and
in
youth
dreamers
of
social
ideals
while
the
intelligent
american
has
been
cursing
him
as
the
ignorant
foreigner
while
the
workingman
has
been
making
life
for
the
sheeny
as
intolerable
as
possible
silent
and
patient
the
despised
man
has
worked
his
way
against
it
all
i
have
myself
seen
such
genuine
heroism
in
the
cause
of
education
practiced
by
girls
and
boys
and
even
by
men
and
women
with
families
as
would
pass
the
limits
of
belief
to
the
ordinary
mind
cold
starvation
all
endured
for
years
in
order
to
obtain
the
means
for
study
and
worse
than
all
exhaustion
of
body
even
to
emaciation
this
is
common
yet
in
the
midst
of
all
this
so
fervent
is
the
social
imagination
of
the
young
that
most
of
them
find
time
besides
to
visit
the
various
clubs
and
societies
where
radical
thought
is
discussed
and
sooner
or
later
ally
themselves
either
with
the
socialist
sections
the
liberal
leagues
the
single
tax
clubs
or
the
anarchist
groups
the
greatest
socialist
daily
in
america
is
the
jewish
and
the
most
active
and
competent
practical
workers
are
jews
so
they
are
among
the
anarchists
i
am
no
propagandist
at
all
costs
or
i
would
leave
the
story
here
but
the
truth
compels
me
to
add
that
as
the
years
pass
and
the
gradual
filtration
and
absorption
of
american
commercial
life
goes
on
my
students
become
successful
professionals
the
golden
mist
of
enthusiasm
vanishes
and
the
old
teacher
must
turn
for
comradeship
to
the
new
youth
who
still
press
forward
with
burning
eyes
seeing
what
is
lost
forever
to
those
whom
common
success
has
satisfied
and
stupified
it
brings
tears
sometimes
but
as
kropotkin
says
let
them
go
we
have
had
the
best
of
them
after
all
who
are
the
really
old
those
who
wear
out
in
faith
and
energy
and
take
to
easy
chairs
and
soft
living
not
kropotkin
with
his
sixty
years
upon
him
who
has
bright
eyes
and
the
eager
interest
of
a
little
child
not
fiery
john
most
the
old
of
the
revolution
unbroken
after
his
ten
years
of
imprisonment
in
europe
and
america
not
louise
michel
with
the
aurora
of
the
morning
still
shining
in
her
keen
look
which
peers
from
behind
the
barred
memories
of
new
caledonia
not
dyer
lum
who
still
smiles
in
his
grave
i
think
nor
tucker
nor
turner
nor
theresa
clairmunt
nor
jean
grave
not
these
i
have
met
them
all
and
felt
the
springing
life
pulsating
through
heart
and
hand
joyous
ardent
leaping
into
action
not
such
are
the
old
but
your
young
heart
that
goes
bankrupt
in
social
hope
in
this
stale
and
purposeless
society
would
you
be
always
young
then
be
an
anarchist
and
live
with
the
faith
of
hope
though
you
be
old
i
doubt
if
any
other
hope
has
the
power
to
keep
the
fire
alight
as
i
saw
it
in
when
we
met
the
spanish
exiles
released
from
the
fortress
of
montjuich
comparatively
few
persons
in
america
ever
knew
the
story
of
that
torture
though
we
distributed
fifty
thousand
copies
of
the
letters
smuggled
from
the
prison
and
some
few
newspapers
did
reprint
them
they
were
the
letters
of
men
incarcerated
on
mere
suspicion
for
the
crime
of
an
unknown
person
and
subjected
to
tortures
the
bare
mention
of
which
makes
one
shudder
their
nails
were
torn
out
their
heads
compressed
in
metal
caps
the
most
sensitive
portions
of
the
body
twisted
between
guitar
strings
their
flesh
burned
with
red
hot
irons
they
had
been
fed
on
salt
codfish
after
days
of
starvation
and
refused
water
juan
ollé
a
boy
nineteen
years
old
had
gone
mad
another
had
confessed
to
something
he
had
never
done
and
knew
nothing
of
this
is
no
horrible
imagination
i
who
write
have
myself
shaken
some
of
those
scarred
hands
indiscriminately
four
hundred
people
of
all
sorts
of
beliefs
republicans
trade
unionists
socialists
free
masons
as
well
as
anarchists
had
been
cast
into
dungeons
and
tortured
in
the
infamous
zero
is
it
a
wonder
that
most
of
them
came
out
anarchists
there
were
in
the
first
lot
that
we
met
at
euston
station
that
august
afternoon
homeless
wanderers
in
the
whirlpool
of
london
released
without
trial
after
months
of
imprisonment
and
ordered
to
leave
spain
in
hours
they
had
left
it
singing
their
prison
songs
and
still
across
their
dark
and
sorrowful
eyes
one
could
see
the
eternal
maytime
bloom
they
drifted
away
to
south
america
chiefly
where
four
or
five
new
anarchist
papers
have
since
arisen
and
several
colonizing
experiments
along
anarchist
lines
are
being
tried
so
tyranny
defeats
itself
and
the
exile
becomes
the
of
the
revolution
and
not
only
to
the
heretofore
unaroused
does
he
bring
awakening
but
the
entire
character
of
the
world
movement
is
modified
by
this
circulation
of
the
comrades
of
all
nations
among
themselves
originally
the
american
movement
the
native
creation
which
arose
with
josiah
warren
in
was
purely
individualistic
the
student
of
economy
will
easily
understand
the
material
and
historical
causes
for
such
development
but
within
the
last
twenty
years
the
communist
idea
has
made
great
progress
owing
primarily
to
that
concentration
in
capitalist
production
which
has
driven
the
american
workingman
to
grasp
at
the
idea
of
solidarity
and
secondly
to
the
expulsion
of
active
communist
propagandists
from
europe
again
another
change
has
come
within
the
last
ten
years
till
then
the
application
of
the
idea
was
chiefly
narrowed
to
industrial
matters
and
the
economic
schools
mutually
denounced
each
other
a
large
and
genial
tolerance
is
growing
the
young
generation
recognizes
the
immense
sweep
of
the
idea
through
all
the
realms
of
art
science
literature
education
sex
relations
and
personal
morality
as
well
as
social
economy
and
welcomes
the
accession
to
the
ranks
of
those
who
struggle
to
realize
the
free
life
no
matter
in
what
field
for
this
is
what
anarchism
finally
means
the
whole
unchaining
of
life
after
two
thousand
years
of
christian
asceticism
and
hypocrisy
apart
from
the
question
of
ideals
there
is
the
question
of
method
how
do
you
propose
to
get
all
this
is
the
question
most
frequently
asked
us
the
same
modification
has
taken
place
here
formerly
there
were
quakers
and
revolutionists
so
there
are
still
but
while
they
neither
thought
well
of
the
other
now
both
have
learned
that
each
has
his
own
use
in
the
great
play
of
world
forces
no
man
is
in
himself
a
unit
and
in
every
soul
jove
still
makes
war
on
christ
nevertheless
the
spirit
of
peace
grows
and
while
it
would
be
idle
to
say
that
anarchists
in
general
believe
that
any
of
the
great
industrial
problems
will
be
solved
without
the
use
of
force
it
would
be
equally
idle
to
suppose
that
they
consider
force
itself
a
desirable
thing
or
that
it
furnishes
a
final
solution
to
any
problem
from
peaceful
experiment
alone
can
come
final
solution
and
that
the
advocates
of
force
know
and
believe
as
well
as
the
tolstoyans
only
they
think
that
the
present
tyrannies
provoke
resistance
the
spread
of
tolstoy
war
and
peace
and
the
slavery
of
our
times
and
the
growth
of
numerous
tolstoy
clubs
having
for
their
purpose
the
dissemination
of
the
literature
of
is
an
evidence
that
many
receive
the
idea
that
it
is
easier
to
conquer
war
with
peace
i
am
one
of
these
i
can
see
no
end
of
retaliations
unless
someone
ceases
to
retaliate
but
let
no
one
mistake
this
for
servile
submission
or
meek
abnegation
my
right
shall
be
asserted
no
matter
at
what
cost
to
me
and
none
shall
trench
upon
it
without
my
protest
satirists
often
remark
that
the
best
way
to
cure
an
anarchist
is
to
give
him
a
fortune
substituting
corrupt
for
cure
i
would
subscribe
to
this
and
believing
myself
to
be
no
better
than
the
rest
of
mortals
i
earnestly
hope
that
as
so
far
it
has
been
my
lot
to
work
and
work
hard
and
for
no
fortune
so
i
may
continue
to
the
end
for
let
me
keep
the
integrity
of
my
soul
with
all
the
limitations
of
my
material
conditions
rather
than
become
the
spineless
and
creation
of
material
needs
my
reward
is
that
i
live
with
the
young
i
keep
step
with
my
comrades
i
shall
die
in
the
harness
with
my
face
to
the
east
the
east
and
the
light
the
eleventh
of
november
memorial
oration
a
let
me
begin
my
address
with
a
confession
i
make
it
sorrowfully
and
with
but
in
the
presence
of
great
sacrifice
we
learn
humility
and
if
my
comrades
could
give
their
lives
for
their
belief
why
let
me
give
my
pride
yet
i
would
not
give
it
for
personal
utterance
is
of
trifling
importance
were
it
not
that
i
think
at
this
particular
season
it
will
encourage
those
of
our
sympathizers
whom
the
recent
outburst
of
savagery
may
have
disheartened
and
perhaps
lead
some
who
are
standing
where
i
once
stood
to
do
as
i
did
later
this
is
my
confession
fifteen
years
ago
last
may
when
the
echoes
of
the
haymarket
bomb
rolled
through
the
little
michigan
village
where
i
then
lived
i
like
the
rest
of
the
credulous
and
brutal
read
one
lying
newspaper
headline
anarchists
throw
a
bomb
in
a
crowd
in
the
haymarket
in
chicago
and
immediately
cried
out
they
ought
to
be
hung
this
though
i
had
never
believed
in
capital
punishment
for
ordinary
criminals
for
that
ignorant
outrageous
bloodthirsty
sentence
i
shall
never
forgive
myself
though
i
know
the
dead
men
would
have
forgiven
me
though
i
know
those
who
loved
them
forgive
me
but
my
own
voice
as
it
sounded
that
night
will
sound
so
in
my
ears
till
i
die
a
bitter
reproach
and
shame
what
had
i
done
credited
the
first
wild
rumor
of
an
event
of
which
i
knew
nothing
and
in
my
mind
sent
men
to
the
gallows
without
asking
one
word
of
defense
in
one
wild
unbalanced
moment
threw
away
the
sympathies
of
a
lifetime
and
became
an
executioner
at
heart
and
what
i
did
that
night
millions
did
and
what
i
said
millions
said
i
have
only
one
word
of
extenuation
for
myself
and
all
those
people
ignorance
i
did
not
know
what
anarchism
was
i
had
never
seen
it
used
save
in
histories
and
there
it
was
always
synonymous
with
social
confusion
and
murder
i
believed
the
newspapers
i
thought
these
men
had
thrown
that
bomb
unprovoked
into
a
mass
of
men
and
women
from
a
wicked
delight
in
killing
and
so
thought
all
those
millions
of
others
but
out
of
those
millions
there
were
some
few
thousand
i
am
glad
i
was
one
of
them
who
did
not
let
the
matter
rest
there
i
know
not
what
resurrection
of
human
decency
first
stirred
within
me
after
that
whether
it
was
an
intellectual
suspicion
that
may
be
i
did
not
know
all
the
truth
of
the
case
and
could
not
believe
the
newspapers
or
whether
it
was
the
old
strong
undercurrent
of
sympathy
which
often
prompts
the
heart
to
go
out
to
the
accused
without
a
reason
but
this
i
do
know
that
though
i
was
no
anarchist
at
the
time
of
the
execution
it
was
long
and
long
before
that
that
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
accusation
was
false
the
trial
a
farce
that
there
was
no
warrant
either
in
justice
or
in
law
for
their
conviction
and
that
the
hanging
if
hanging
there
should
be
would
be
the
act
of
a
society
composed
of
people
who
had
said
what
i
said
on
the
first
night
and
who
had
kept
their
eyes
and
ears
fast
shut
ever
since
determined
to
see
nothing
and
to
know
nothing
but
rage
and
vengeance
till
the
very
end
i
hoped
that
mercy
might
intervene
though
justice
did
not
and
from
the
hour
i
knew
neither
would
nor
ever
could
again
i
distrusted
law
and
lawyers
judges
and
governors
alike
and
my
whole
being
cried
out
to
know
what
it
was
these
men
had
stood
for
and
why
they
were
hanged
seeing
it
was
not
proven
they
knew
anything
about
the
throwing
of
the
bomb
little
by
little
here
and
there
i
came
to
know
that
what
they
had
stood
for
was
a
very
high
and
noble
ideal
of
human
life
and
what
they
were
hanged
for
was
preaching
it
to
the
common
people
the
common
people
who
were
as
ready
to
hang
them
in
their
ignorance
as
the
court
and
the
prosecutor
were
in
their
malice
little
by
little
i
came
to
know
that
these
were
men
who
had
a
clearer
vision
of
human
right
than
most
of
their
fellows
and
who
being
moved
by
deep
social
sympathies
wished
to
share
their
vision
with
their
fellows
and
so
proclaimed
it
in
the
little
by
little
i
realized
that
the
misery
the
pathetic
submission
the
awful
degradation
of
the
workers
which
from
the
time
i
was
old
enough
to
begin
to
think
had
borne
heavily
upon
my
heart
as
they
must
bear
upon
all
who
have
hearts
to
feel
at
all
had
smitten
theirs
more
deeply
still
so
deeply
that
they
knew
no
rest
save
in
seeking
a
way
out
and
that
was
more
than
i
had
ever
had
the
sense
to
conceive
for
me
there
had
never
been
a
hope
there
should
be
no
more
rich
and
poor
but
a
vague
idea
that
there
might
not
be
so
rich
and
so
poor
if
the
workingmen
by
combining
could
exact
a
little
better
wages
and
make
their
hours
a
little
shorter
it
was
the
message
of
these
men
and
their
death
swept
that
message
far
out
into
ears
that
would
never
have
heard
their
living
voices
that
all
such
little
dreams
are
folly
that
not
in
demanding
little
not
in
striking
for
an
hour
less
not
in
mountain
labor
to
bring
forth
mice
can
any
lasting
alleviation
come
but
in
demanding
much
all
in
a
bold
of
the
worker
to
toil
any
hours
he
finds
sufficient
not
that
another
finds
for
him
here
is
where
the
way
out
lies
that
message
and
the
message
of
others
whose
works
associated
with
theirs
their
death
drew
to
my
notice
took
me
up
as
it
were
upon
a
mighty
hill
wherefrom
i
saw
the
roofs
of
the
workshops
of
the
little
world
i
saw
the
machines
the
things
that
men
had
made
to
ease
their
burden
the
wonderful
things
the
iron
genii
i
saw
them
set
their
iron
teeth
in
the
living
flesh
of
the
men
who
made
them
i
saw
the
maimed
and
crippled
stumps
of
men
go
limping
away
into
the
night
that
engulfs
the
poor
perhaps
to
be
thrown
up
in
the
flotsam
and
jetsam
of
beggary
for
a
time
perhaps
to
suicide
in
some
dim
corner
where
the
black
surge
throws
its
slime
i
saw
the
rose
fire
of
the
furnace
shining
on
the
blanched
face
of
the
man
who
tended
it
and
knew
surely
as
i
knew
anything
in
life
that
never
would
a
free
man
feed
his
blood
to
the
fire
like
that
i
saw
swart
bodies
all
mangled
and
crushed
borne
from
the
mouths
of
the
mines
to
be
stowed
away
in
a
grave
hardly
less
narrow
and
dark
than
that
in
which
the
living
form
had
crouched
ten
twelve
fourteen
hours
a
day
and
i
knew
that
in
order
that
i
might
be
warm
i
and
you
and
those
others
who
never
do
any
dirty
work
those
men
had
slaved
away
in
those
black
graves
and
been
crushed
to
death
at
last
i
saw
beside
city
streets
great
heaps
of
horrible
colored
earth
and
down
at
the
bottom
of
the
trench
from
which
it
was
thrown
so
far
down
that
nothing
else
was
visible
bright
gleaming
eyes
like
a
wild
animal
hunted
into
its
hole
and
i
knew
that
free
men
never
chose
to
labor
there
with
pick
and
shovel
in
that
foul
earth
in
that
narrow
trench
in
that
deadly
sewer
gas
ten
eight
even
six
hours
a
day
only
slaves
would
do
it
i
saw
deep
down
in
the
hull
of
the
ocean
liner
the
men
who
shoveled
the
coal
burned
and
seared
like
paper
before
the
grate
and
i
knew
that
the
record
of
the
beautiful
monster
and
the
pleasure
of
the
ladies
who
laughed
on
the
deck
were
paid
for
with
these
withered
bodies
and
souls
i
saw
the
scavenger
carts
go
up
and
down
drawn
by
sad
brutes
driven
by
sadder
ones
for
never
a
man
a
man
in
full
possession
of
his
would
freely
choose
to
spend
all
his
days
in
the
nauseating
stench
that
forces
him
to
swill
alcohol
to
neutralize
it
and
i
saw
in
the
lead
works
how
men
were
poisoned
and
in
the
sugar
refineries
how
they
went
insane
and
in
the
factories
how
they
lost
their
decency
and
in
the
stores
how
they
learned
to
lie
and
i
knew
it
was
slavery
made
them
do
all
this
i
knew
the
anarchists
were
right
the
whole
thing
must
be
changed
the
whole
thing
was
wrong
the
whole
system
of
production
and
distribution
the
whole
ideal
of
life
and
i
questioned
the
government
then
they
had
taught
me
to
question
it
what
have
you
done
you
the
keepers
of
the
declaration
and
the
constitution
what
have
you
done
about
all
this
what
have
you
done
to
preserve
the
conditions
of
freedom
to
the
people
lied
deceived
fooled
tricked
bought
and
sold
and
got
gain
you
have
sold
away
the
land
that
you
had
no
right
to
sell
you
have
murdered
the
aboriginal
people
that
you
might
seize
the
land
in
the
name
of
the
white
race
and
then
steal
it
away
from
them
again
to
be
again
sold
by
a
second
and
a
third
robber
and
that
buying
and
selling
of
the
land
has
driven
the
people
off
the
healthy
earth
and
away
from
the
clean
air
into
these
of
humanity
called
cities
where
every
filthy
thing
is
done
and
filthy
labor
breeds
filthy
bodies
and
filthy
souls
our
boys
are
decayed
with
vice
before
they
come
to
manhood
our
girls
ah
well
might
john
harvey
write
another
begetteth
a
daughter
white
and
gold
she
looks
into
the
meadow
land
water
and
the
world
knows
her
no
more
they
have
sought
her
field
and
fold
but
the
city
the
city
hath
bought
her
it
hath
sold
her
piecemeal
to
students
rats
and
reek
of
the
graveyard
mould
you
have
done
this
thing
gentlemen
who
engineer
the
government
and
not
only
have
you
caused
this
ruin
to
come
upon
others
you
yourselves
are
rotten
with
this
debauchery
you
exist
for
the
purpose
of
granting
privileges
to
whoever
can
pay
most
for
you
and
so
limiting
the
freedom
of
men
to
employ
themselves
that
they
must
sell
themselves
into
this
frightful
slavery
or
become
tramps
beggars
thieves
prostitutes
and
murderers
and
when
you
have
done
all
this
what
then
do
you
do
to
them
these
creatures
of
your
own
making
you
who
have
set
them
the
example
in
every
villainy
do
you
then
relent
and
remembering
the
words
of
the
great
religious
teacher
to
whom
most
of
you
offer
lip
service
on
the
officially
religious
day
do
you
go
to
these
poor
broken
wretched
creatures
and
love
them
love
them
and
help
them
to
teach
them
to
be
better
no
you
build
prisons
high
and
strong
and
there
you
beat
and
starve
and
hang
finding
by
the
working
of
your
system
human
beings
so
unutterably
degraded
that
they
are
willing
to
kill
whomsoever
they
are
told
to
kill
at
so
much
monthly
salary
this
is
what
the
government
is
has
always
been
the
creator
and
defender
of
privilege
the
organization
of
oppression
and
revenge
to
hope
that
it
can
ever
become
anything
else
is
the
vainest
of
delusions
they
tell
you
that
anarchy
the
dream
of
social
order
without
government
is
a
wild
fancy
the
wildest
dream
that
ever
entered
the
heart
of
man
is
the
dream
that
mankind
can
ever
help
itself
through
an
appeal
to
law
or
to
come
to
any
order
that
will
not
result
in
slavery
wherein
there
is
any
excuse
for
government
it
was
for
telling
the
people
this
that
these
five
men
were
killed
for
telling
the
people
that
the
only
way
to
get
out
of
their
misery
was
first
to
learn
what
their
rights
upon
this
earth
were
freedom
to
use
the
land
and
all
within
it
and
all
the
tools
of
production
and
then
to
stand
all
together
and
take
them
themselves
and
not
to
appeal
to
the
jugglers
of
the
law
abolish
the
law
that
is
abolish
privilege
and
crime
will
abolish
itself
they
will
tell
you
these
men
were
hanged
for
advocating
force
what
these
creatures
who
drill
men
in
the
science
of
killing
who
put
guns
and
clubs
in
hands
they
train
to
shoot
and
strike
who
hail
with
delight
the
latest
inventions
in
explosives
who
exult
in
the
machine
that
can
kill
the
most
with
the
least
expenditure
of
energy
who
declare
a
war
of
extermination
upon
people
who
do
not
want
their
civilization
who
ravish
and
burn
and
garotte
and
guillotine
and
hang
and
electrocute
they
have
the
impertinence
to
talk
about
the
unrighteousness
of
force
true
these
men
did
advocate
the
right
to
resist
invasion
by
force
you
will
find
scarcely
one
in
a
thousand
who
does
not
believe
in
that
right
the
one
will
be
either
a
real
christian
or
a
anarchist
it
will
not
be
a
believer
in
the
state
no
no
it
was
not
for
advocating
forcible
resistance
on
principle
but
for
advocating
forcible
resistance
to
their
tyrannies
and
for
advocating
a
society
which
would
forever
make
an
end
of
riches
and
poverty
of
governors
and
governed
the
spirit
of
revenge
which
is
always
stupid
accomplished
its
brutal
act
had
it
lifted
its
eyes
from
its
work
it
might
have
seen
in
the
background
of
the
scaffold
that
bleak
november
morning
the
of
anarchy
whiten
across
the
world
so
it
came
first
a
gleam
of
hope
to
the
proletaire
a
summons
to
rise
and
shake
off
his
material
bondage
but
steadily
steadily
the
light
has
grown
as
year
by
year
the
scientist
the
literary
genius
the
artist
and
the
moral
teacher
have
brought
to
it
the
tribute
of
their
best
work
their
unpaid
work
the
work
they
did
for
love
it
means
not
only
material
emancipation
too
it
comes
as
the
summing
up
of
all
those
lines
of
thought
and
action
which
for
three
hundred
years
have
been
making
towards
freedom
it
means
fulness
of
being
the
free
life
and
i
say
it
boldly
notwithstanding
the
recent
outburst
of
condemnation
notwithstanding
the
cry
of
lynch
burn
shoot
imprison
deport
and
the
scarlet
letter
a
to
be
branded
low
down
upon
the
forehead
and
the
latest
excuse
for
that
fond
esthetic
decoration
the
button
that
for
two
thousand
years
no
idea
has
so
stirred
the
world
as
this
none
which
had
such
living
power
to
break
down
barriers
of
race
and
degree
to
attract
prince
and
proletaire
poet
and
mechanic
quaker
and
revolutionist
no
other
ideal
but
the
free
life
is
strong
enough
to
touch
the
man
whose
infinite
pity
and
understanding
goes
alike
to
the
hypocrite
priest
and
the
victim
of
siberian
whips
the
loving
rebel
who
stepped
from
his
title
and
his
wealth
to
labor
with
all
the
laboring
earth
the
sweet
strong
singer
who
sang
no
master
high
or
low
the
lover
who
does
not
measure
his
love
nor
reckon
on
return
the
one
who
will
not
rule
but
also
will
not
ruled
be
the
philosopher
who
chanted
the
the
devoted
woman
of
the
people
ay
and
these
too
these
rebellious
flashes
from
the
vast
ominous
obscurity
of
the
anonymous
these
souls
whom
governmental
and
capitalistic
brutality
has
whipped
and
goaded
and
stung
to
blind
rage
and
bitterness
these
mad
young
lions
of
revolt
these
winkelrieds
who
offer
their
hearts
to
the
spears
a
delivered
on
november
in
chicago
crime
and
punishment
men
are
of
three
sorts
the
turn
backs
the
and
the
indifferents
the
first
and
second
are
comparatively
few
in
number
the
really
conscientious
conservative
eternally
looking
backward
for
his
models
and
trying
hard
to
preserve
that
which
is
is
almost
as
scarce
an
article
as
the
genuine
radical
who
is
eternally
attacking
that
which
is
and
looking
forward
to
some
indistinct
but
glowing
vision
of
a
purified
social
life
between
them
lies
the
vast
nitrogenous
body
of
the
indifferents
who
go
through
life
with
no
large
thoughts
or
intense
feelings
of
any
kind
the
best
that
can
be
said
of
them
being
that
they
serve
to
dilute
the
too
fierce
activities
of
the
other
two
into
the
callous
ears
of
these
indifferents
nevertheless
the
opposing
voices
of
conservative
and
radical
are
continually
shouting
and
for
years
for
centuries
the
conservative
wins
the
day
not
because
he
really
touches
the
consciences
of
the
indifferent
so
much
though
in
a
measure
he
does
that
as
because
his
way
causes
his
hearer
the
least
mental
trouble
it
is
easier
to
this
lazy
inert
mentality
to
nod
its
head
and
approve
the
continuance
of
things
as
they
are
than
to
listen
to
proposals
for
change
to
consider
to
question
to
make
an
innovating
decision
these
require
activity
application
and
nothing
is
so
foreign
to
the
hibernating
social
conscience
of
your
ordinary
individual
i
say
social
conscience
because
i
by
no
means
wish
to
say
that
these
are
conscienceless
people
they
have
for
active
use
sufficient
conscience
to
go
through
their
daily
parts
in
life
and
they
think
that
is
all
that
is
required
of
the
lives
of
others
of
the
effects
of
their
attitude
in
cursing
the
existences
of
thousands
whom
they
do
not
know
they
have
no
conception
they
sleep
and
they
hear
the
voices
of
those
who
cry
aloud
about
these
things
dimly
as
in
dreams
and
they
do
not
wish
to
awaken
nevertheless
at
the
end
of
the
centuries
they
always
awaken
it
is
the
radical
who
always
wins
at
last
at
the
end
of
the
centuries
institutions
are
reviewed
by
this
aroused
social
conscience
are
revised
sometimes
are
utterly
rooted
out
thus
it
is
with
the
institutions
of
crime
and
punishment
the
conservative
holds
that
these
things
have
been
decided
from
all
time
that
crime
is
a
with
no
other
cause
than
the
viciousness
of
man
that
punishment
was
decreed
from
mt
sinai
or
whatever
holy
mountain
happens
to
be
believed
in
in
his
country
that
society
is
best
served
by
strictness
and
severity
of
judgment
and
punishment
and
he
wishes
only
to
make
his
indifferent
brothers
keepers
of
other
men
consciences
along
these
lines
he
would
have
all
men
be
hunters
of
men
that
crime
may
be
tracked
down
and
struck
down
the
radical
says
all
false
all
false
and
wrong
crime
has
not
been
decided
from
all
time
crime
like
everything
else
has
had
its
evolution
according
to
place
time
and
circumstance
the
demons
of
our
sires
become
the
saints
that
we
adore
and
the
saints
the
saints
and
the
heroes
of
our
fathers
are
criminals
according
to
our
codes
abraham
david
solomon
could
any
respectable
member
of
society
admit
that
he
had
done
the
things
they
did
crime
is
not
a
not
a
plant
without
roots
not
a
something
proceeding
from
nothing
and
the
only
true
way
to
deal
with
it
is
to
seek
its
causes
as
earnestly
as
painstakingly
as
the
astronomer
seeks
the
causes
of
the
perturbations
in
the
orbit
of
the
planet
he
is
observing
sure
that
there
must
be
one
or
many
somewhere
and
punishment
too
must
be
studied
the
holy
mountain
theory
is
a
failure
punishment
is
a
failure
and
it
is
a
failure
not
because
men
do
not
hunt
down
and
strike
enough
but
because
they
hunt
down
and
strike
at
all
because
in
the
chase
of
those
who
do
ill
they
do
ill
themselves
they
brutalize
their
own
characters
and
so
much
the
more
so
because
they
are
convinced
that
this
time
the
brutal
act
is
done
in
accord
with
conscience
the
murderous
deed
of
the
criminal
was
conscience
the
torture
or
the
murder
of
the
criminal
by
the
official
is
conscience
thus
the
conscience
is
diseased
and
perverted
and
a
new
class
of
imbruted
men
created
we
have
punished
and
punished
for
untold
thousands
of
years
and
we
have
not
gotten
rid
of
crime
we
have
not
diminished
it
let
us
consider
then
the
indifferentist
shrugs
his
shoulders
and
remarks
to
the
conservative
what
have
i
to
do
with
it
i
will
hunt
nobody
and
i
will
save
nobody
let
every
one
take
care
of
himself
i
pay
my
taxes
let
the
judges
and
the
lawyers
take
care
of
the
criminals
and
as
for
you
mr
radical
you
weary
me
your
talk
is
too
heroic
you
want
to
play
atlas
and
carry
the
heavens
on
your
shoulders
well
do
it
if
you
like
but
do
imagine
i
am
going
to
act
the
stupid
hercules
and
transfer
your
burden
to
my
shoulders
rave
away
until
you
are
tired
but
let
me
alone
i
will
not
let
you
alone
i
am
no
atlas
i
am
no
more
than
a
fly
but
i
will
annoy
you
i
will
buzz
in
your
ears
i
will
not
let
you
sleep
you
must
think
about
this
that
is
about
the
height
and
power
of
my
voice
or
of
any
individual
voice
in
the
present
state
of
the
question
i
do
not
deceive
myself
i
do
not
imagine
that
the
question
of
crime
and
punishment
will
be
settled
till
long
long
after
the
memory
of
me
shall
be
as
completely
swallowed
up
by
time
as
last
year
snow
is
swallowed
by
the
sea
two
thousand
years
ago
a
man
whose
soul
revolted
at
punishment
cried
out
judge
not
that
ye
be
not
judged
and
yet
men
and
women
who
have
taken
his
name
upon
their
lips
as
holy
have
for
all
those
two
thousand
years
gone
on
judging
as
if
their
belief
in
what
he
said
was
only
and
they
do
it
and
judges
sit
upon
benches
and
send
men
to
their
death
even
judges
who
do
not
themselves
believe
in
capital
punishment
and
prosecutors
exhaust
their
eloquence
and
their
tricks
to
get
men
convicted
and
women
and
men
bear
witness
against
sinners
and
then
they
all
meet
in
church
and
pray
forgive
us
our
trespasses
as
we
forgive
those
who
trespass
against
us
do
they
mean
anything
at
all
by
it
and
i
know
that
just
as
the
voice
of
jesus
was
not
heard
and
is
not
heard
save
here
and
there
just
as
the
voice
of
tolstoy
is
not
heard
save
here
and
there
and
others
great
and
small
are
lost
in
the
great
echoless
desert
of
indifferentism
having
produced
little
perceptible
effect
so
my
voice
also
will
be
lost
and
barely
a
slight
ripple
of
thought
be
propagated
over
that
dry
and
fruitless
expanse
even
that
the
next
wind
of
trial
will
straighten
and
leave
as
unimprinted
sand
nevertheless
by
the
continued
and
unintermitting
action
of
forces
infinitesimal
compared
with
the
human
voice
the
greatest
effects
are
at
length
accomplished
a
of
light
is
but
the
part
of
an
inch
yet
by
the
continuous
action
of
waves
like
these
have
been
produced
all
the
creations
of
light
the
entire
world
of
sight
out
of
masses
irresponsive
dark
colorless
and
doubt
not
that
in
time
this
cold
and
irresponsive
mass
of
indifference
will
feel
and
stir
and
realize
the
force
of
the
great
sympathies
which
will
change
the
attitude
of
the
human
mind
as
a
whole
towards
crime
and
punishment
and
erase
both
from
the
world
not
by
lawyers
and
not
by
judges
shall
the
final
cause
of
the
criminal
be
tried
but
lawyer
and
judge
and
criminal
together
shall
be
told
by
the
social
conscience
depart
in
peace
a
great
ethical
teacher
once
wrote
words
like
unto
these
i
have
within
me
the
capacity
for
every
crime
few
reading
them
believe
that
he
meant
what
he
said
most
take
it
as
the
sententious
utterance
of
one
who
in
an
abandonment
of
generosity
wished
to
say
something
large
and
leveling
but
i
think
he
meant
exactly
what
he
said
i
think
that
with
all
his
purity
emerson
had
within
him
the
turbid
stream
of
passion
and
desire
for
all
his
granite
features
he
knew
the
instincts
of
the
weakling
and
the
slave
and
for
all
the
sweetness
the
tenderness
and
the
nobility
of
his
nature
he
had
the
tiger
and
the
jackal
in
his
soul
i
think
that
within
every
bit
of
human
flesh
and
spirit
that
has
ever
crossed
the
enigma
bridge
of
life
from
the
prehistoric
racial
morning
until
now
all
crime
and
all
virtue
were
germinal
out
of
one
great
are
we
sprung
you
and
i
and
all
of
us
and
if
in
you
the
virtue
has
grown
and
not
the
vice
do
not
therefore
conclude
that
you
are
essentially
different
from
him
whom
you
have
helped
to
put
in
stripes
and
behind
bars
your
balance
may
be
more
even
you
may
be
mixed
in
smaller
proportions
altogether
or
the
outside
temptation
has
not
come
upon
you
i
am
no
disciple
of
that
school
whose
doctrine
is
summed
up
in
the
teaching
that
man
will
is
nothing
his
material
surroundings
all
i
do
not
accept
that
popular
socialism
which
would
make
saints
out
of
sinners
only
by
filling
their
stomachs
i
am
no
apologist
for
characterlessness
and
no
petitioner
for
universal
moral
weakness
i
believe
in
the
individual
i
believe
that
the
purpose
of
life
in
so
far
as
we
can
give
it
a
purpose
and
it
has
none
save
what
we
give
it
is
the
assertion
and
the
development
of
strong
personality
it
is
therefore
that
no
religion
which
offers
vicarious
atonement
for
the
misdoer
and
no
philosophy
which
rests
on
the
cornerstone
of
irresponsibility
makes
any
appeal
to
me
i
believe
that
immeasurable
mischief
has
been
wrought
by
the
ceaseless
repetition
for
the
last
two
thousand
years
of
the
formula
not
through
any
merit
of
mine
shall
i
enter
heaven
but
through
the
sacrifice
of
christ
not
through
the
sacrifice
of
christ
nor
any
other
sacrifice
shall
any
one
attain
strength
save
in
so
far
as
he
takes
the
spirit
and
the
purpose
of
the
sacrifice
into
his
own
life
and
lives
it
nor
do
i
see
anything
as
the
result
of
the
teaching
that
all
men
are
the
helpless
victims
of
external
circumstance
and
under
the
same
conditions
will
act
precisely
alike
than
a
lot
of
spineless
nerveless
bloodless
crawlers
in
the
tracks
of
stronger
men
too
desirous
of
ease
to
be
honest
too
weak
to
be
successful
rascals
let
this
be
put
as
strongly
as
it
can
now
that
nothing
i
shall
say
hereafter
may
be
interpreted
as
a
gospel
of
shifting
and
shirking
but
the
difference
between
us
the
anarchists
who
preach
and
none
else
and
moralists
who
in
times
past
and
present
have
asked
for
individual
responsibility
is
this
that
while
they
have
always
framed
creeds
and
codes
for
the
purpose
of
others
to
we
draw
the
line
upon
ourselves
set
the
standard
as
high
as
you
will
live
to
it
as
near
as
you
can
and
if
you
fail
try
yourself
judge
yourself
condemn
yourself
if
you
choose
teach
and
persuade
your
neighbor
if
you
can
consider
and
compare
his
conduct
if
you
please
speak
your
mind
if
you
desire
but
if
he
fails
to
reach
your
standard
or
his
own
try
him
not
judge
him
not
condemn
him
not
he
lies
beyond
your
sphere
you
can
not
know
the
temptation
nor
the
inward
battle
nor
the
weight
of
the
circumstances
upon
him
you
do
not
know
how
long
he
fought
before
he
failed
therefore
you
can
not
be
just
let
him
alone
this
is
the
ethical
concept
at
which
we
have
arrived
not
by
revelation
from
any
superior
power
not
through
the
reading
of
any
inspired
book
not
by
special
illumination
of
our
inner
consciousness
but
by
the
study
of
the
results
of
social
experiment
in
the
past
as
presented
in
the
works
of
historians
psychologists
criminologists
sociologists
and
legalists
very
likely
so
many
ists
sound
a
little
oppressive
and
there
may
be
those
to
whom
they
may
even
have
a
savor
of
pedantry
it
sounds
much
simpler
and
less
ostentatious
to
say
thus
saith
the
lord
or
the
good
book
says
but
in
the
meat
and
marrow
these
last
are
the
real
presumptions
these
claims
of
familiarity
with
the
will
and
intent
of
omnipotence
it
may
sound
more
pedantic
to
you
to
say
i
have
studied
the
accumulated
wisdom
of
man
and
drawn
certain
deductions
therefrom
than
to
say
i
had
a
talk
with
god
this
morning
and
he
said
thus
and
so
but
to
me
the
first
statement
is
infinitely
more
modest
moreover
there
is
some
chance
of
its
being
true
while
the
other
is
highly
imaginative
fiction
this
is
not
to
impugn
the
honesty
of
those
who
inherit
this
survival
of
an
earlier
mental
state
of
the
race
and
who
accept
it
as
they
accept
their
appetites
or
anything
else
they
find
themselves
born
with
nor
is
it
to
belittle
those
past
efforts
of
active
and
ardent
souls
who
claimed
direct
divine
inspiration
as
the
source
of
their
doctrines
all
religions
have
been
in
their
great
general
outlines
the
intuitive
graspings
of
the
race
at
truths
which
it
had
not
yet
sufficient
knowledge
to
demonstrate
rude
and
imperfect
statements
of
ideas
which
were
yet
but
germinal
but
which
even
then
mankind
had
urgent
need
to
conceive
and
upon
which
it
afterwards
spent
the
efforts
of
generations
of
lives
to
correct
and
perfect
thus
the
very
ethical
concept
of
which
i
have
been
speaking
as
peculiarly
anarchistic
was
preached
as
a
religious
doctrine
by
the
fifteenth
century
tolstoy
peter
chilciky
and
in
the
sixteenth
century
the
fanatical
sect
of
the
anabaptists
shook
germany
from
center
to
circumference
by
a
doctrine
which
included
the
declaration
that
pleadings
in
courts
of
law
oaths
capital
punishment
and
all
absolute
power
were
incompatible
with
the
christian
faith
it
was
an
imperfect
illumination
of
the
intellect
such
only
as
was
possible
in
those
less
enlightened
days
but
an
illumination
that
defined
certain
noble
conceptions
of
justice
they
appealed
to
all
they
had
the
bible
the
inner
light
the
best
that
they
knew
to
justify
their
faith
we
to
whom
a
wider
day
is
given
who
can
appeal
not
to
one
book
but
to
thousands
who
have
the
light
of
science
which
is
free
to
all
that
can
command
the
leisure
and
the
will
to
know
shining
white
and
open
on
these
great
questions
dim
and
obscure
in
the
days
of
peter
chilciky
we
should
be
the
last
to
cast
a
sneer
at
them
for
their
heroic
struggle
with
tyranny
and
cruelty
though
the
man
who
would
claim
their
claims
on
their
grounds
would
justly
be
rated
atavist
or
charlatan
nothing
or
next
to
nothing
did
the
anabaptists
know
of
history
for
genuine
history
history
which
records
the
growth
of
a
whole
people
which
traces
the
evolution
of
its
mind
as
seen
in
its
works
of
peace
its
literature
its
art
its
constructions
is
the
creation
of
our
own
age
only
within
the
last
years
has
the
purpose
of
history
come
to
have
so
much
depth
as
this
before
that
it
was
a
mere
register
of
dramatic
situations
with
no
particular
connection
a
chronicle
of
the
deeds
of
prominent
persons
a
list
of
intrigues
scandals
murders
big
and
little
and
the
great
people
the
actual
builders
and
preservers
of
the
race
the
immense
patient
silent
mass
who
painfully
filled
up
all
the
waste
places
these
destroyers
made
almost
ignored
and
no
man
sought
to
discover
the
relations
of
even
the
recorded
acts
to
any
general
causes
no
man
conceived
the
notion
of
discovering
what
is
political
and
moral
growth
or
political
and
moral
suicide
that
they
did
not
do
so
is
because
writers
of
history
who
are
themselves
incarnations
of
their
own
time
spirit
could
not
get
beyond
the
unscientific
attitude
of
mind
born
of
ignorance
and
fostered
by
the
christian
religion
that
man
is
something
entirely
different
from
the
rest
of
organized
life
that
he
is
a
free
moral
agent
good
if
he
pleases
and
bad
if
he
pleases
that
is
according
as
he
accepts
or
rejects
the
will
of
god
that
every
act
is
isolated
having
no
antecedent
morally
but
the
will
of
its
doer
nor
until
modern
science
had
fought
its
way
past
prisons
exilements
stakes
scaffolds
and
tortures
to
the
demonstration
that
man
is
no
freak
thrust
by
an
omnipotent
joker
upon
a
world
of
cause
and
sequence
to
play
havoc
therein
but
just
a
poor
differentiated
bit
of
protoplasm
as
much
subject
to
the
general
processes
of
matter
and
mind
as
his
ancient
progenitor
in
the
depths
of
the
silurian
sea
not
until
then
was
it
possible
for
any
real
conception
of
the
scope
of
history
to
begin
not
until
then
was
it
said
the
actions
of
men
are
the
effects
of
large
and
general
causes
humanity
as
a
whole
has
a
regularity
of
movement
as
fixed
as
the
movement
of
the
tides
and
given
certain
physical
and
social
environments
certain
developments
may
be
predicted
with
the
certainty
of
a
mathematical
calculation
thus
crime
which
for
so
many
ages
men
have
gone
on
punishing
more
or
less
so
far
from
having
its
final
cause
in
individual
depravity
bears
a
steady
and
invariable
relation
to
the
production
and
distribution
of
staple
food
supplies
a
thing
over
which
society
itself
at
times
can
have
no
control
as
on
the
occasion
of
great
natural
disturbances
and
in
general
does
not
yet
know
how
to
manage
wisely
how
much
less
then
the
individual
this
regularity
of
the
recurrence
of
crime
was
pointed
out
long
before
by
the
greatest
statisticians
of
europe
who
indeed
did
not
go
so
far
as
to
question
why
it
was
so
nor
to
compare
these
regularities
with
other
regularities
but
upon
whom
the
constant
repetition
of
certain
figures
in
the
statistics
of
murder
suicide
assault
made
a
profound
impression
it
was
left
to
the
new
historians
the
great
pioneer
among
whom
was
buckle
in
england
to
make
the
comparisons
in
the
statistics
and
show
that
individual
crimes
as
well
as
virtues
are
always
calculable
from
general
material
conditions
this
is
the
basis
from
which
we
argue
and
it
is
a
basis
established
by
the
comparative
history
of
civilizations
in
no
other
way
could
it
have
been
really
established
it
might
have
been
guessed
at
and
indeed
was
but
only
when
the
figures
are
before
us
figures
obtained
by
millions
of
observations
extending
over
different
grades
of
civilization
with
different
laws
different
opinions
different
habits
different
morals
i
am
quoting
buckle
only
then
are
we
able
to
say
surely
that
the
human
mind
proceeds
with
a
regularity
of
operation
overweighing
all
the
creeds
and
codes
ever
invented
and
that
if
we
would
begin
to
understand
the
problem
of
the
treatment
of
crime
we
must
go
to
something
far
larger
than
the
moral
reformation
of
the
criminal
no
prayers
no
legal
enactments
will
ever
rid
society
of
crime
if
they
would
there
have
been
prayers
enough
and
preachments
enough
and
laws
enough
and
prisons
enough
to
have
done
it
long
ago
but
pray
that
the
attraction
of
gravitation
shall
cease
will
it
cease
enact
that
water
shall
freeze
at
heat
will
it
freeze
and
no
more
will
men
be
sane
and
honest
and
just
when
they
are
compelled
to
live
in
an
insane
dishonest
and
unjust
society
when
the
natural
operation
of
the
very
elements
of
their
being
is
warred
upon
by
statutes
and
institutions
which
must
produce
outbursts
destructive
both
to
themselves
and
to
others
away
back
in
quetelet
the
french
statistician
wrote
experience
demonstrates
in
fact
by
every
possible
evidence
this
opinion
which
may
seem
paradoxical
at
first
that
it
is
society
which
prepares
the
crime
and
that
the
guilty
one
is
but
the
instrument
which
executes
it
every
crime
therefore
is
a
charge
against
society
which
can
only
be
rightly
replied
to
when
society
consents
to
look
into
its
own
errors
and
rectify
the
wrong
it
has
done
this
is
one
of
the
results
which
must
in
the
end
flow
from
the
labors
of
the
real
historians
one
of
the
reasons
why
history
was
worth
writing
at
all
now
the
next
point
in
the
problem
is
the
criminal
himself
admitting
what
can
not
be
impeached
that
there
is
cause
and
sequence
in
the
action
of
man
admitting
the
pressure
of
general
causes
upon
all
alike
what
is
the
reason
that
one
man
is
a
criminal
and
another
not
from
the
days
of
the
roman
jurisconsults
until
now
the
legalists
themselves
have
made
a
distinction
between
crimes
against
the
law
of
nature
and
crimes
merely
against
the
law
of
society
from
the
modern
scientific
standpoint
no
such
distinction
can
be
maintained
nature
knows
nothing
about
crime
and
nothing
ever
was
a
crime
until
the
social
conscience
made
it
so
neither
is
it
easy
when
one
reads
their
law
books
even
accepting
their
to
understand
why
certain
crimes
were
catalogued
as
against
the
law
of
nature
and
certain
others
as
of
the
more
artificial
character
but
i
presume
what
were
in
general
classed
as
crimes
against
nature
were
acts
of
violence
committed
against
persons
aside
from
these
we
have
a
vast
an
almost
interminable
number
of
offenses
big
and
little
which
are
in
the
main
attacks
upon
the
institution
of
property
concerning
which
some
very
different
things
have
to
be
said
than
concerning
the
first
as
to
these
first
there
is
no
doubt
that
these
are
real
crimes
by
which
i
mean
simply
acts
any
action
which
violates
the
life
or
liberty
of
any
individual
is
an
act
whether
done
by
one
person
by
two
or
by
a
whole
nation
and
the
greatest
crime
that
ever
was
perpetrated
a
crime
beside
which
all
individual
atrocities
diminish
to
nothing
is
war
and
the
greatest
the
least
excusable
of
murderers
are
those
who
order
it
and
those
who
execute
it
nevertheless
this
chiefest
of
murderers
the
government
its
own
hands
red
with
the
blood
of
hundreds
of
thousands
assumes
to
correct
the
individual
offender
enacting
miles
of
laws
to
define
the
varying
degrees
of
his
offense
and
punishment
and
putting
beautiful
building
stone
to
very
hideous
purposes
for
the
sake
of
caging
and
tormenting
him
therein
we
do
get
a
fig
from
a
thistle
sometimes
out
of
this
noisome
thing
the
prison
has
sprung
the
study
of
criminology
it
is
very
new
and
there
is
considerable
painstaking
nonsense
about
it
but
the
main
results
are
interesting
and
should
be
known
by
all
who
wish
to
form
an
intelligent
conception
of
what
a
criminal
is
and
how
he
should
be
treated
these
men
who
are
cool
and
quiet
and
who
move
among
criminals
and
study
them
as
darwin
did
his
plants
and
animals
tell
us
that
these
prisoners
are
reducible
to
three
types
the
born
criminal
the
criminaloid
and
the
accidental
criminal
i
am
inclined
to
doubt
a
great
deal
that
is
said
about
the
born
criminal
lombroso
gives
us
very
exhaustive
reports
of
the
measurements
of
their
skulls
and
their
ears
and
their
noses
and
their
thumbs
and
their
toes
etc
but
i
suspect
that
if
a
good
many
respectable
decent
people
were
to
go
up
for
measurement
malformed
ears
and
disproportionately
long
thumbs
would
be
equally
found
among
them
if
they
took
the
precaution
to
represent
themselves
as
criminals
first
still
however
few
in
number
and
they
are
really
very
few
there
are
some
born
criminals
people
who
through
some
malformation
or
deficiency
or
excess
of
certain
portions
of
the
brain
are
constantly
impelled
to
violent
deeds
well
there
are
some
born
idiots
and
some
born
cripples
do
you
punish
them
for
their
idiocy
or
for
their
unfortunate
physical
condition
on
the
contrary
you
pity
them
you
realize
that
life
is
a
long
infliction
to
them
and
your
best
and
tenderest
sympathies
go
out
to
them
why
not
to
the
other
equally
a
helpless
victim
of
an
evil
inheritance
granting
for
the
moment
that
you
have
the
right
to
punish
the
mentally
responsible
surely
you
will
not
claim
the
right
to
punish
the
mentally
irresponsible
even
the
law
does
not
hold
the
insane
man
guilty
and
the
born
criminal
is
irresponsible
he
is
a
sick
man
sick
with
the
most
pitiable
chronic
disease
his
treatment
is
for
the
medical
world
to
decide
and
the
best
of
them
not
for
the
prosecutor
the
judge
and
the
warden
it
is
true
that
many
criminologists
including
lombroso
himself
are
of
opinion
that
the
best
thing
to
do
with
the
born
criminal
is
to
kill
him
at
once
since
he
can
be
only
a
curse
to
himself
and
others
very
heroic
treatment
we
may
inquire
is
he
to
be
exterminated
at
birth
because
of
certain
physical
indications
of
his
criminality
such
would
scarcely
commend
itself
to
any
modern
society
moreover
the
diagnosis
might
be
wrong
even
though
we
had
a
perpetual
and
incorruptible
commission
of
the
learned
to
sit
in
inquiry
upon
every
little
suspect
three
days
old
what
then
is
he
to
be
let
go
as
he
is
now
until
he
does
some
violent
deed
and
then
be
judged
more
hardly
because
of
his
natural
defect
either
proposition
seems
not
only
heartless
and
wicked
but
what
the
respectable
world
is
often
more
afraid
of
being
than
either
ludicrous
if
one
is
really
a
born
criminal
he
will
manifest
criminal
tendencies
in
early
life
and
being
so
recognized
should
be
cared
for
according
to
the
most
humane
methods
of
treating
the
mentally
afflicted
the
second
or
criminaloid
class
is
the
most
numerous
of
the
three
these
are
criminals
first
because
being
endowed
with
strong
desires
and
unequal
reasoning
powers
they
can
not
maintain
the
uneven
battle
against
a
society
wherein
the
majority
of
individuals
must
all
the
time
deny
their
natural
appetites
if
they
are
to
remain
unstained
with
crime
they
are
in
short
the
ordinary
man
who
it
must
be
admitted
has
a
great
deal
of
paste
in
him
plus
an
excess
of
wants
of
one
sort
and
another
but
generally
physical
society
outside
of
prisons
is
full
of
these
criminaloids
who
sometimes
have
in
place
of
the
power
of
genuine
moral
resistance
a
sneaking
cunning
by
which
they
manage
to
steer
a
shady
course
between
the
crime
and
the
punishment
it
is
true
these
people
are
not
pleasant
subjects
to
contemplate
but
then
through
that
very
stage
of
development
the
whole
human
race
has
had
to
pass
in
its
progress
from
the
beast
to
the
man
the
stage
i
mean
of
overplus
of
appetite
opposed
by
weak
moral
resistance
and
if
now
some
it
is
not
certain
that
their
number
is
very
great
have
reversed
the
proportion
it
is
only
because
they
are
the
fortunate
inheritors
of
the
results
of
thousands
of
years
of
struggle
and
failure
struggle
and
failure
but
again
it
is
precisely
these
criminaloids
who
are
most
sinned
against
by
society
for
they
are
the
people
who
need
to
have
the
right
of
doing
things
made
easy
and
who
when
they
act
criminally
need
the
most
encouragement
to
help
the
feeble
and
humiliated
moral
sense
to
rise
again
to
try
again
the
third
class
the
accidental
or
occasional
criminals
are
perfectly
normal
well
balanced
people
who
through
tremendous
stress
of
outward
circumstance
and
possibly
some
untoward
mental
disturbance
arising
from
those
very
notions
of
the
conduct
of
life
which
form
part
of
their
moral
being
suddenly
commit
an
act
of
violence
which
is
at
utter
variance
with
their
whole
former
existence
such
as
for
instance
the
murder
of
a
seducer
by
the
father
of
the
injured
girl
or
of
a
wife
paramour
by
her
husband
if
i
believed
in
severity
at
all
i
should
say
that
these
were
the
criminals
upon
whom
society
should
look
with
most
severity
because
they
are
the
ones
who
have
most
mental
responsibility
but
that
also
is
nonsense
for
such
an
individual
has
within
him
a
severer
judge
a
more
pitiless
jailer
than
any
court
or
prison
his
conscience
and
his
memory
leave
him
to
these
or
no
in
mercy
take
him
away
from
these
whenever
you
can
he
will
suffer
enough
and
there
is
no
fear
of
his
action
being
repeated
now
all
these
people
are
with
us
and
it
is
desirable
that
something
be
done
to
help
the
case
what
does
society
do
or
rather
what
does
government
do
with
them
remember
we
are
speaking
now
only
of
crimes
of
violence
it
hangs
it
electrocutes
it
exiles
it
imprisons
why
for
punishment
and
why
punishment
not
says
blackstone
by
way
of
atonement
or
expiation
for
the
crime
committed
for
that
must
be
left
to
the
just
determination
of
the
supreme
being
but
as
a
precaution
against
future
offenses
of
the
same
kind
this
is
supposed
to
be
effected
in
three
ways
either
by
reforming
him
or
getting
rid
of
him
altogether
or
by
deterring
others
by
making
an
example
of
him
let
us
see
how
these
precautions
work
exile
which
is
still
practised
by
some
governments
and
imprisonment
are
according
to
the
theory
of
law
for
the
purpose
of
reforming
the
criminal
that
he
may
no
longer
be
a
menace
to
society
logic
would
say
that
anyone
who
wished
to
obliterate
cruelty
from
the
character
of
another
must
himself
show
no
cruelty
one
who
would
teach
regard
for
the
rights
of
others
must
himself
be
regardful
yet
the
story
of
exile
and
prison
is
the
story
of
the
lash
the
iron
the
chain
and
every
torture
that
the
fiendish
ingenuity
of
class
can
devise
by
way
of
teaching
criminals
to
be
to
teach
men
to
be
good
they
are
kept
in
airless
cells
made
to
sleep
on
narrow
planks
to
look
at
the
sky
through
iron
grates
to
eat
food
that
revolts
their
palates
and
destroys
their
stomachs
battered
and
broken
down
in
body
and
soul
and
this
is
what
they
call
reforming
men
not
very
many
years
ago
the
philadelphia
dailies
told
us
and
while
we
can
not
believe
all
of
what
they
say
and
are
bound
to
believe
that
such
cases
are
exceptional
yet
the
bare
facts
were
true
that
judge
gordon
ordered
an
investigation
into
the
workings
of
the
eastern
penitentiary
officials
and
it
was
found
that
an
insane
man
had
been
put
into
a
cell
with
two
sane
ones
and
when
he
cried
in
his
insane
way
and
the
two
asked
that
he
be
put
elsewhere
the
warden
gave
them
a
strap
to
whip
him
with
and
they
tied
him
in
some
way
to
the
heater
with
the
strap
so
that
his
legs
were
burned
when
he
moved
all
scarred
with
the
burns
he
was
brought
into
the
court
and
the
other
men
frankly
told
what
they
had
done
and
why
they
had
done
it
this
is
the
way
they
reform
men
do
you
think
people
come
out
of
a
place
like
that
better
with
more
respect
for
society
with
more
regard
for
the
rights
of
their
fellow
men
i
do
i
think
they
come
out
of
there
with
their
hearts
full
of
bitterness
much
harder
than
when
they
went
in
that
this
is
often
the
case
is
admitted
by
those
who
themselves
believe
in
punishment
and
practice
it
for
the
fact
is
that
out
of
the
criminaloid
class
there
develops
the
habitual
criminal
the
man
who
is
perpetually
getting
in
prison
no
sooner
is
he
out
than
he
does
something
else
and
gets
in
again
the
brand
that
at
first
scorched
him
has
succeeded
in
searing
he
no
longer
feels
the
ignominy
he
is
a
and
he
gets
to
have
a
cynical
pride
in
his
own
degradation
every
man
hand
is
against
him
and
his
hand
is
against
every
man
such
are
the
reforming
effects
of
punishment
yet
there
was
a
time
when
he
too
might
have
been
touched
had
the
right
word
been
spoken
it
is
for
society
to
find
and
speak
that
word
this
for
prison
and
exile
hanging
electrocution
these
of
course
are
not
for
the
purpose
of
reforming
the
criminal
these
are
to
deter
others
from
doing
as
he
did
and
the
supposition
is
that
the
severer
the
punishment
the
greater
the
deterrent
effect
in
commenting
upon
this
principle
blackstone
says
we
may
observe
that
punishments
of
unreasonable
severity
have
less
effect
in
preventing
crimes
and
amending
the
manners
of
a
people
than
such
as
are
more
merciful
in
general
he
further
quotes
montesquieu
for
the
excessive
severity
of
laws
hinders
their
execution
when
the
punishment
surpasses
all
measure
the
public
will
frequently
out
of
humanity
prefer
impunity
to
it
again
blackstone
it
is
a
melancholy
truth
that
among
the
variety
of
actions
which
men
are
daily
liable
to
commit
no
less
than
one
hundred
and
sixty
have
been
declared
by
act
of
parliament
to
be
felonies
worthy
of
instant
death
so
dreadful
a
list
instead
of
diminishing
the
number
of
offenders
robert
ingersoll
speaking
on
crimes
against
criminals
before
the
new
york
bar
association
a
lawyer
addressing
lawyers
treating
of
this
same
period
of
which
blackstone
writes
says
there
is
something
in
injustice
in
cruelty
which
tends
to
defeat
itself
there
never
were
so
many
traitors
in
england
as
when
the
traitor
was
drawn
and
quartered
when
he
was
tortured
in
every
possible
way
when
his
limbs
torn
and
bleeding
were
given
to
the
fury
of
mobs
or
exhibited
pierced
by
pikes
or
hung
in
chains
the
frightful
punishments
produced
intense
hatred
of
the
government
and
traitors
increased
until
they
became
powerful
enough
to
decide
what
treason
was
and
who
the
traitors
were
and
to
inflict
the
same
torments
on
others
the
fact
that
blackstone
was
right
and
ingersoll
was
right
in
saying
that
severity
of
punishment
increases
crime
is
silently
admitted
in
the
abrogation
of
those
severities
by
acts
of
parliament
and
acts
of
congress
it
is
also
shown
by
the
fact
that
there
are
no
more
murders
proportionately
in
states
where
the
death
penalty
does
not
exist
than
in
those
where
it
does
severity
is
therefore
admitted
by
the
state
itself
to
have
no
deterrent
influence
on
the
intending
criminal
and
to
take
the
matter
out
of
the
province
of
the
state
we
have
only
to
instance
the
horrible
atrocities
perpetrated
by
white
mobs
upon
negroes
charged
with
outrage
nothing
more
fiendishly
cruel
can
be
imagined
yet
these
outrages
multiply
it
would
seem
then
that
the
notion
of
making
a
horrible
example
of
the
misdoer
is
a
complete
failure
as
a
specific
example
of
this
ingersoll
in
this
same
lecture
instanced
that
a
few
years
before
a
man
was
hanged
in
alexandria
one
who
witnessed
the
execution
on
that
very
day
murdered
a
peddler
in
the
smithsonian
grounds
at
washington
he
was
tried
and
executed
and
one
who
witnessed
his
hanging
went
home
and
on
the
same
day
murdered
his
wife
evidently
the
brute
is
rather
aroused
than
terrified
by
scenes
of
execution
what
then
if
extreme
punishments
do
not
deter
and
if
what
are
considered
mild
punishments
do
not
reform
is
any
measure
of
punishment
conceivable
or
attainable
which
will
better
our
case
before
answering
this
question
let
us
consider
the
class
of
crimes
which
so
far
has
not
been
dwelt
upon
but
which
nevertheless
comprises
probably
of
all
offenses
committed
these
are
all
the
various
forms
of
stealing
robbery
burglary
theft
embezzlement
forgery
counterfeiting
and
the
thousand
and
one
ramifications
and
offshoots
of
the
act
of
taking
what
the
law
defines
as
another
it
is
impossible
to
consider
crimes
of
violence
apart
from
these
because
the
vast
percentage
of
murders
and
assaults
committed
by
the
criminaloid
class
are
simply
incidental
to
the
commission
of
the
lesser
crime
a
man
often
murders
in
order
to
escape
with
his
booty
though
murder
was
no
part
of
his
original
intention
why
now
have
we
such
a
continually
increasing
percentage
of
stealing
will
you
persistently
hide
your
heads
in
the
sand
and
say
it
is
because
men
grow
worse
as
they
grow
wiser
that
individual
wickedness
is
the
result
of
all
our
marvelous
labors
to
compass
sea
and
land
and
make
the
earth
yield
up
her
wealth
to
us
dare
you
say
that
it
is
not
so
reason
men
steal
is
because
their
rights
are
stolen
from
them
before
they
are
a
human
being
comes
into
the
world
he
wants
to
eat
he
wants
to
breathe
he
wants
to
sleep
he
wants
to
use
his
muscles
his
brain
he
wants
to
love
to
dream
to
create
these
wants
constitute
him
the
whole
man
he
can
no
more
help
expressing
these
activities
than
water
can
help
running
down
hill
if
the
freedom
to
do
any
of
these
things
is
denied
him
then
by
so
much
he
is
a
crippled
creature
and
his
energy
will
force
itself
into
some
abnormal
channel
or
be
killed
altogether
now
i
do
not
mean
that
he
has
a
natural
right
to
do
these
things
inscribed
on
any
lawbook
of
nature
nature
knows
nothing
of
rights
she
knows
power
only
and
a
louse
has
as
much
natural
right
as
a
man
to
the
extent
of
its
power
what
i
do
mean
to
say
is
that
man
in
common
with
many
other
animals
has
found
that
by
associative
life
he
conquers
the
rest
of
nature
and
that
this
society
is
slowly
being
perfected
and
that
this
perfectionment
consists
in
realizing
that
the
solidarity
and
safety
of
the
whole
arises
from
the
freedom
of
the
parts
that
such
freedom
constitutes
man
social
right
and
that
any
institution
which
interferes
with
this
right
will
be
destructive
of
the
association
will
breed
criminals
will
work
its
own
ruin
this
is
the
word
of
the
sociologist
of
the
greatest
of
them
herbert
spencer
now
do
we
see
that
all
men
eat
eat
well
you
know
we
do
not
some
have
so
much
that
they
are
sickened
with
the
extravagance
of
dishes
and
know
not
where
next
to
turn
for
a
new
palatal
sensation
they
can
not
even
waste
their
wealth
some
and
they
are
mostly
the
hardest
workers
eat
poorly
and
fast
for
their
work
allows
them
no
time
to
enjoy
even
what
they
have
some
i
have
seen
them
myself
in
the
streets
of
new
york
this
winter
and
the
look
of
their
wolfish
eyes
was
not
pleasant
to
see
stand
in
long
lines
waiting
for
midnight
and
the
plate
of
soup
dealt
out
by
some
great
newspaper
office
stretching
out
whole
blocks
of
them
as
other
men
wait
on
the
first
night
of
some
famous
star
at
the
theater
some
die
because
they
can
not
eat
at
all
pray
tell
me
what
these
last
have
to
lose
by
becoming
thieves
and
why
shall
they
not
become
thieves
and
is
the
action
of
the
man
who
takes
the
necessities
which
have
been
denied
to
him
really
criminal
is
he
morally
worse
than
the
man
who
crawls
in
a
cellar
and
dies
of
starvation
i
think
not
he
is
only
a
little
more
assertive
cardinal
manning
said
a
starving
man
has
a
natural
right
to
his
neighbor
bread
the
anarchist
says
a
hungry
man
has
a
social
right
to
bread
and
there
have
been
whole
societies
and
races
among
whom
that
right
was
never
questioned
and
whatever
were
the
mistakes
of
those
societies
whereby
they
perished
this
was
not
a
mistake
and
we
shall
do
well
to
take
so
much
wisdom
from
the
dead
and
gone
the
simple
ethics
of
the
stomach
which
with
all
our
achievement
we
can
not
despise
or
despising
shall
perish
as
our
reward
but
you
will
say
and
say
truly
to
begin
by
taking
loaves
means
to
end
by
taking
everything
and
murdering
too
very
often
and
in
that
you
draw
the
indictment
against
your
own
system
if
there
is
no
alternative
between
starving
and
stealing
and
for
thousands
there
is
none
then
there
is
no
alternative
between
society
murdering
its
members
or
the
members
disintegrating
society
let
society
consider
its
own
mistakes
then
let
it
answer
itself
for
all
these
people
it
has
robbed
and
killed
let
it
cease
its
own
crimes
first
to
return
to
the
faculties
of
man
all
would
breathe
and
some
do
breathe
they
breathe
the
air
of
the
mountains
of
the
seas
of
the
lakes
even
the
atmosphere
in
the
gambling
dens
of
monte
carlo
for
a
change
some
packed
thickly
together
in
closed
rooms
where
men
must
sweat
and
faint
to
save
tobacco
breathe
the
noisome
reek
that
rises
from
the
spittle
of
their
consumptive
neighbors
some
mostly
babies
lie
on
the
cellar
doors
along
bainbridge
street
on
summer
nights
and
bathe
their
lungs
in
that
putrid
air
where
a
thousand
lungs
have
breathed
before
and
grow
up
pale
and
decayed
looking
as
the
rotting
vegetables
whose
exhalations
they
draw
in
some
far
down
underground
meet
the
and
do
not
breathe
at
all
do
you
expect
healthy
morals
out
of
all
these
poisoned
bodies
some
sleep
they
have
so
much
time
that
they
take
all
manner
of
expensive
drugs
to
try
what
sleeping
it
off
a
different
way
is
like
some
sleep
upon
none
too
easy
beds
a
few
short
hours
too
few
not
to
waken
more
tired
than
ever
and
resume
the
endless
grind
of
waking
life
some
sleep
bent
over
the
books
they
are
too
tired
to
study
though
the
mind
clamors
for
food
after
the
long
day
physical
toil
some
sleep
with
hand
upon
the
throttle
of
the
engine
after
hours
of
duty
and
crash
they
have
sleep
enough
some
use
their
muscles
they
use
them
to
punch
bags
and
other
gentlemen
stomachs
when
their
heads
are
full
of
wine
some
use
them
to
club
other
men
and
women
at
a
day
some
exhaust
them
welding
them
into
iron
or
weaving
them
into
wool
for
ten
or
eleven
hours
a
day
and
some
become
atrophied
sitting
at
desks
till
they
are
mere
specters
of
men
and
women
some
love
and
there
is
no
end
to
the
sensualities
of
their
love
because
all
normal
expressions
have
lost
their
savor
through
excess
some
love
and
see
their
love
tried
and
worn
and
threadbare
a
skeleton
of
love
because
the
practicality
of
life
is
always
there
to
repress
the
purely
emotional
some
are
stricken
in
health
so
robbed
of
power
to
feel
that
they
never
love
at
all
and
some
dream
think
create
and
the
world
is
filled
with
the
glory
of
their
dreams
but
who
knows
the
glory
of
the
dream
that
never
was
born
lost
and
dead
and
buried
away
somewhere
there
under
the
roofs
where
the
exquisite
brain
was
ruined
by
the
heavy
labor
of
life
and
what
of
the
dream
that
turned
to
madness
and
destroyed
the
thing
it
loved
the
best
these
are
the
things
that
make
criminals
the
perverted
forces
of
man
turned
aside
by
the
institution
of
property
which
is
the
giant
social
mistake
it
is
your
law
which
keeps
men
from
using
the
sources
and
the
means
of
wealth
production
unless
they
pay
tribute
to
other
men
it
is
this
and
nothing
else
which
is
responsible
for
all
the
second
class
of
crimes
and
all
those
crimes
of
violence
incidentally
committed
while
carrying
out
a
robbery
let
me
quote
here
a
most
sensible
and
appropriate
editorial
which
recently
appeared
in
the
philadelphia
in
comment
upon
the
proposition
of
some
foolish
preacher
to
limit
the
right
of
reproduction
to
rich
families
the
earth
was
constructed
made
habitable
and
populated
without
the
advice
of
a
commission
of
superior
persons
and
until
they
appeared
and
began
meddling
with
affairs
making
laws
and
setting
themselves
up
as
rulers
poverty
and
its
evil
consequences
were
unknown
to
humanity
when
social
science
finds
a
way
to
remove
obstructions
to
the
operation
of
natural
law
and
to
the
equitable
distribution
of
the
products
of
labor
poverty
will
cease
to
be
the
condition
of
the
masses
of
people
and
misery
crime
and
problems
of
population
will
disappear
and
they
will
never
disappear
until
it
does
all
hunting
down
of
men
all
punishments
are
but
so
many
ineffective
efforts
to
sweep
back
the
tide
with
a
broom
the
tide
will
fling
you
broom
and
all
against
the
idle
walls
that
you
have
built
to
fence
it
in
tear
down
those
walls
or
the
sea
will
tear
them
down
for
you
have
you
ever
watched
it
coming
in
the
sea
when
the
wind
comes
roaring
out
of
the
mist
and
a
great
bellowing
thunders
up
from
the
water
have
you
watched
the
white
lions
chasing
each
other
towards
the
walls
and
leaping
up
with
foaming
anger
as
they
strike
and
turn
and
chase
each
other
along
the
black
bars
of
their
cage
in
rage
to
devour
each
other
and
tear
back
and
leap
in
again
have
you
ever
wondered
in
the
midst
of
it
all
particular
drops
of
would
strike
the
wall
if
one
could
know
all
the
factors
one
might
calculate
even
that
but
who
can
know
them
all
of
one
thing
only
we
are
sure
must
strike
they
are
the
criminals
those
drops
of
water
pitching
against
that
silly
wall
and
broken
just
why
it
was
these
particular
ones
we
can
not
know
but
some
had
to
go
do
not
curse
them
you
have
cursed
them
enough
let
the
people
free
there
is
a
class
of
crimes
of
violence
which
arises
from
another
set
of
causes
than
economic
slavery
acts
which
are
the
result
of
an
antiquated
moral
notion
of
the
true
relations
of
men
and
women
these
are
the
nemesis
of
the
institution
of
property
in
love
if
every
one
would
learn
that
the
limit
of
his
right
to
demand
a
certain
course
of
conduct
in
sex
relations
is
himself
that
the
relation
of
his
beloved
ones
to
others
is
not
a
matter
for
him
to
regulate
any
more
than
the
relations
of
those
whom
he
does
not
love
if
the
freedom
of
each
is
unquestioned
and
whatever
moral
rigors
are
exacted
are
exacted
of
oneself
only
if
this
principle
is
accepted
and
followed
crimes
of
jealousy
will
cease
but
religions
and
governments
uphold
this
institution
and
constantly
tend
to
create
the
spirit
of
ownership
with
all
its
horrible
consequences
ah
you
will
say
perhaps
it
is
true
perhaps
when
this
better
social
condition
is
evolved
and
this
freer
social
spirit
we
shall
be
rid
of
crime
at
least
of
it
but
meanwhile
must
we
not
punish
to
protect
ourselves
the
protection
does
not
protect
the
violent
man
does
not
communicate
his
intention
when
he
executes
it
or
attempts
its
execution
more
often
than
otherwise
it
is
some
unofficial
person
who
catches
or
stops
him
if
he
is
a
born
criminal
or
in
other
words
an
insane
man
he
should
i
reiterate
be
treated
as
a
sick
person
not
punished
not
made
to
suffer
if
he
is
one
of
the
accidental
criminals
his
act
will
not
be
repeated
his
punishment
will
always
be
with
him
if
he
is
of
the
middle
class
your
punishment
will
not
reform
him
it
will
only
harden
him
and
it
will
not
deter
others
as
for
thieves
the
great
thief
is
within
the
law
or
he
buys
it
and
as
for
the
small
one
see
what
you
do
to
protect
yourself
against
him
you
create
a
class
of
persons
who
are
sworn
to
the
service
of
the
club
and
the
revolver
a
set
of
spies
a
set
whose
business
it
is
to
deal
constantly
with
these
unhappy
beings
who
in
rare
instances
are
softened
thereby
but
in
the
majority
of
cases
become
hardened
to
their
work
as
butchers
to
the
use
of
the
knife
a
set
whose
business
it
is
to
serve
cell
and
lock
and
key
and
lastly
the
lowest
infamy
of
all
the
hangman
does
any
one
want
to
shake
his
hand
the
hand
that
kills
for
pay
now
against
all
these
persons
individually
there
is
nothing
to
be
said
they
may
probably
be
very
humane
persons
when
they
start
in
but
the
end
of
all
this
is
imbrutement
one
of
our
dailies
recently
observed
that
the
men
in
charge
of
prisons
have
but
too
often
been
men
who
ought
themselves
to
have
been
prisoners
the
anarchist
does
not
agree
with
that
he
would
have
no
prisons
at
all
but
i
am
quite
sure
that
if
that
editor
himself
were
put
in
the
place
he
too
would
turn
hard
and
the
opportunities
of
the
official
criminal
are
much
greater
than
those
of
the
unofficial
one
lawyer
and
governmentalist
as
he
was
ingersoll
said
it
is
safe
to
say
that
governments
have
committed
far
more
crimes
than
they
have
prevented
then
why
create
a
second
class
of
parasites
worse
than
the
first
why
not
put
up
with
the
original
one
moreover
you
have
another
thing
to
consider
than
the
simple
problem
of
a
wrong
inflicted
upon
a
guilty
man
how
many
times
has
it
happened
that
the
innocent
man
has
been
convicted
i
remember
an
instance
of
a
man
so
convicted
of
murder
in
michigan
he
had
served
years
in
jackson
penitentiary
for
michigan
is
not
a
when
the
real
murderer
dying
confessed
and
the
state
that
innocent
man
because
it
was
the
quickest
legal
way
to
let
him
out
i
hope
he
has
been
able
to
pardon
the
state
not
very
long
ago
a
man
was
hanged
here
in
this
city
he
had
killed
his
superintendent
some
doctors
said
he
was
insane
the
government
experts
said
he
was
not
they
said
he
was
faking
insanity
when
he
proclaimed
himself
jesus
christ
and
he
was
hanged
afterwards
the
doctors
found
two
cysts
in
his
brain
the
state
of
pennsylvania
had
killed
a
sick
man
and
as
long
as
punishments
exist
these
mistakes
will
occur
if
you
accept
the
principle
at
all
you
must
accept
with
it
the
of
innocent
men
not
only
this
but
you
must
accept
also
the
responsibility
for
all
the
misery
which
results
to
others
whose
lives
are
bound
up
with
that
of
the
convict
for
even
he
is
loved
by
some
one
much
loved
perhaps
it
is
a
foolish
thing
to
turn
adrift
a
house
full
of
children
to
become
criminals
in
turn
perhaps
in
order
to
frighten
some
indefinite
future
offender
by
making
an
example
of
their
father
or
mother
yet
how
many
times
has
it
not
happened
and
this
is
speaking
only
from
the
practical
selfish
side
of
the
matter
there
is
another
one
from
which
i
would
rather
appeal
to
you
and
from
which
i
think
you
would
after
all
prefer
to
be
appealed
to
ask
yourselves
each
of
you
whether
you
are
quite
sure
that
you
have
feeling
enough
understanding
enough
and
you
enough
to
be
able
to
weigh
and
measure
out
another
man
life
or
liberty
no
matter
what
he
has
done
and
if
you
have
not
yourself
are
you
able
to
delegate
to
any
judge
the
power
which
you
have
not
the
great
russian
novelist
dostoyevsky
in
his
psychological
study
of
this
same
subject
traces
the
sufferings
of
a
man
who
had
committed
a
shocking
murder
his
whole
body
and
brain
are
a
continual
prey
to
torture
he
gives
himself
up
seeking
relief
in
confession
he
goes
to
prison
for
in
barbarous
russia
they
have
not
the
barbarity
of
capital
punishment
for
murderers
unless
political
ones
but
he
finds
no
relief
he
remains
for
a
year
bitter
resentful
a
prey
to
all
miserable
feelings
but
at
last
he
is
touched
by
love
the
silent
unobtrusive
love
of
one
who
knew
it
all
and
forgave
it
all
and
the
regeneration
of
his
soul
began
the
criminal
slew
says
tolstoy
are
you
better
then
when
you
slay
he
took
another
liberty
and
is
it
the
right
way
therefore
for
you
to
take
his
violence
is
no
answer
to
violence
have
good
will
to
all
that
lives
letting
unkindness
die
and
greed
and
wrath
so
that
your
lives
be
made
as
soft
airs
passing
by
so
said
lord
buddha
the
light
of
asia
and
another
said
ye
have
heard
that
it
hath
been
said
eye
for
an
eye
and
a
tooth
for
a
tooth
but
i
say
unto
you
resist
not
him
that
is
evil
yet
the
vengeance
that
the
great
psychologist
saw
was
futile
the
violence
that
the
greatest
living
religious
teacher
and
the
greatest
dead
ones
advised
no
man
to
wreak
that
violence
is
done
daily
and
hourly
by
every
prosecutor
who
prosecutes
at
so
much
a
day
by
every
petty
judge
who
buys
his
way
into
office
with
common
politicians
tricks
and
deals
in
men
lives
and
liberties
as
a
trader
deals
in
pins
by
every
and
member
of
the
unco
guid
whose
respectable
maxims
of
morality
have
as
much
effect
to
stem
the
great
floods
and
storms
that
shake
the
human
will
as
the
waving
of
a
lady
kid
glove
against
the
tempest
those
who
have
not
suffered
can
not
understand
how
to
punish
those
who
have
understanding
not
i
said
at
the
beginning
and
i
say
again
i
believe
that
in
every
one
of
us
all
things
are
germinal
in
judge
and
prosecutor
and
too
and
even
in
those
small
moral
souls
who
cut
out
one
undeviating
pattern
for
all
men
to
fit
even
in
them
there
are
the
germs
of
passion
and
crime
and
sympathy
and
forgiveness
and
some
day
things
will
stir
in
them
and
accuse
them
and
awaken
them
and
that
awakening
will
come
when
suddenly
one
day
there
breaks
upon
them
with
realizing
force
the
sense
of
the
unison
of
life
the
irrevocable
relationship
of
the
saint
to
the
sinner
the
judge
to
the
criminal
that
all
personalities
are
intertwined
and
rushing
upon
doom
together
once
in
my
life
it
was
given
to
me
to
see
the
outward
manifestation
of
this
unison
it
was
in
we
stood
upon
the
base
of
the
nelson
monument
in
trafalgar
square
below
were
ten
thousand
people
packed
together
with
upturned
faces
they
had
gathered
to
hear
and
see
men
and
women
whose
hands
and
limbs
were
scarred
all
over
with
the
irons
of
the
tortures
in
the
fortress
of
montjuich
for
the
crime
of
an
unknown
person
these
men
and
women
together
with
four
hundred
others
had
been
cast
into
that
terrible
den
and
tortured
with
the
infamies
of
the
inquisition
to
make
them
reveal
that
of
which
they
knew
nothing
after
a
year
of
such
suffering
as
makes
the
decent
human
heart
sick
only
to
contemplate
with
nothing
proven
against
them
some
even
without
trial
they
were
suddenly
released
with
orders
to
leave
the
country
within
hours
they
were
then
in
trafalgar
square
and
to
the
credit
of
old
england
be
it
said
harlot
and
mother
of
harlots
though
she
is
for
there
was
not
another
country
among
the
great
nations
of
the
earth
to
which
those
innocent
people
could
go
for
they
were
paupers
impoverished
by
that
cruel
state
of
spain
in
the
terrible
battle
for
their
freedom
they
would
not
have
been
admitted
to
free
america
when
francesco
gana
speaking
in
a
language
which
most
of
them
did
not
understand
lifted
his
poor
scarred
hands
the
faces
of
those
ten
thousand
people
moved
together
like
the
leaves
of
a
forest
in
the
wind
they
waved
to
and
fro
they
rose
and
fell
the
visible
moved
in
the
breath
of
the
invisible
it
was
the
revelation
of
the
action
of
the
unconscious
the
fatalistic
unity
of
man
sometimes
even
now
as
i
look
upon
you
it
is
as
if
the
bodies
that
i
see
were
as
transparent
bubbles
wherethrough
the
red
blood
boils
and
flows
a
turbulent
stream
churning
and
tossing
and
leaping
and
behind
us
and
our
generation
far
far
back
endlessly
backwards
where
all
the
bubbles
are
broken
and
not
a
ripple
remains
the
silent
pouring
of
the
great
red
river
the
unfathomable
river
backwards
through
the
unbroken
forest
and
the
untilled
plain
backwards
through
the
forgotten
world
of
savagery
and
animal
life
back
somewhere
to
its
dark
sources
in
deep
sea
and
old
night
the
rushing
river
of
blood
no
fancy
real
tangible
blood
the
blood
that
hurries
in
your
veins
while
i
speak
bearing
with
it
the
curses
and
the
blessings
of
the
past
through
what
infinite
shadows
has
that
river
rolled
through
what
desolate
wastes
has
it
not
spread
its
ooze
through
what
desperate
passages
has
it
been
forced
what
strength
what
invincible
strength
is
in
that
hot
stream
you
are
just
the
bubble
on
its
crest
where
will
the
current
fling
you
ere
you
die
at
what
moment
will
the
fierce
impurities
borne
from
its
somber
and
tenebrous
past
be
hurled
up
in
you
shall
you
then
cry
out
for
punishment
if
they
are
hurled
up
in
another
if
flung
against
the
merciless
rocks
of
the
channel
while
you
swim
easily
in
the
midstream
they
fall
back
and
hurt
other
bubbles
can
you
not
feel
that
men
are
the
of
man
the
plumes
that
feather
his
wings
since
being
began
with
the
wind
and
the
thunder
of
things
things
are
cruel
and
blind
their
strength
detains
and
deforms
and
the
wearying
wings
of
the
mind
still
beat
up
the
stream
of
their
storms
still
as
one
swimming
they
strike
out
blind
in
the
blast
in
thunder
of
vision
and
dream
and
lightning
of
future
and
past
we
are
baffled
and
caught
in
the
current
and
bruised
upon
edges
of
shoals
as
weeds
or
as
reeds
in
the
torrent
of
things
are
the
souls
spirit
by
spirit
goes
under
a
bubble
of
breath
that
blows
and
opens
asunder
and
blurs
not
the
mirror
of
death
is
it
not
enough
that
things
are
cruel
and
blind
must
we
also
be
cruel
and
blind
when
the
whole
thing
amounts
to
so
little
at
the
most
shall
we
embitter
it
more
and
crush
and
stifle
what
must
so
soon
be
crushed
and
stifled
anyhow
can
we
not
knowing
what
remnants
of
things
dead
and
drowned
are
floating
through
us
haunting
our
brains
with
specters
of
old
deeds
and
scenes
of
violence
can
we
not
learn
to
pardon
our
brother
to
whom
the
specters
are
more
real
upon
whom
greater
stress
was
laid
can
we
not
recalling
all
the
evil
things
that
we
have
done
or
left
undone
only
because
some
scarcely
perceptible
weight
struck
down
the
balance
or
because
some
kindly
word
came
to
us
in
the
midst
of
our
bitterness
and
showed
that
not
all
was
hateful
in
the
world
can
we
not
understand
him
for
whom
the
balance
was
not
struck
down
the
kind
word
unspoken
believe
me
forgiveness
is
better
than
wrath
better
for
the
who
will
be
touched
and
regenerated
by
it
and
better
for
you
and
you
are
wrong
if
you
think
it
is
hard
it
is
easy
far
easier
than
to
hate
it
may
sound
like
a
paradox
but
the
greater
the
injury
the
easier
the
pardon
let
us
have
done
with
this
savage
idea
of
punishment
which
is
without
wisdom
let
us
work
for
the
freedom
of
man
from
the
oppressions
which
make
criminals
and
for
the
enlightened
treatment
of
all
the
sick
and
though
we
may
never
see
the
fruit
of
it
we
may
rest
assured
that
the
great
tide
of
thought
is
setting
our
way
and
that
while
the
tired
wave
vainly
breaking
seems
here
no
painful
inch
to
gain
far
back
through
creeks
and
inlets
making
comes
silent
flooding
in
the
main
in
defense
of
emma
goldman
and
the
right
of
expropriation
the
light
is
pleasant
is
it
not
my
friends
it
is
good
to
look
into
each
other
faces
to
see
the
hands
that
clasp
our
own
to
read
the
eyes
that
search
our
thoughts
to
know
what
manner
of
lips
give
utterance
to
our
pleasant
greetings
it
is
good
to
be
able
to
wink
defiance
at
the
night
the
cold
unseeing
night
how
weird
how
gruesome
how
chilly
it
would
be
if
i
stood
here
in
blackness
a
shadow
addressing
shadows
in
a
house
of
blindness
yet
each
would
know
that
he
was
not
alone
yet
might
we
stretch
hands
and
touch
each
other
and
feel
the
warmth
of
human
presence
near
yet
might
a
sympathetic
voice
ring
thro
the
darkness
quickening
the
dragging
the
lonely
prisoners
in
the
cells
of
blackwell
island
have
neither
light
nor
sound
the
short
day
hurries
across
the
sky
the
short
day
still
more
shortened
in
the
gloomy
walls
the
long
chill
night
creeps
up
so
early
weaving
its
sombre
curtain
before
the
imprisoned
eyes
and
thro
the
curtain
comes
no
sympathizing
voice
beyond
the
curtain
lies
the
prison
silence
beyond
that
the
cheerless
uncommunicating
land
and
still
beyond
the
icy
fretting
river
black
and
menacing
ready
to
drown
a
wall
of
night
a
wall
of
stone
a
wall
of
water
thus
has
the
great
state
of
new
york
answered
thus
have
the
classes
replied
to
the
masses
thus
do
the
rich
respond
to
the
poor
thus
does
the
institution
of
property
give
its
ultimatum
to
hunger
give
us
work
said
if
you
will
not
give
us
work
then
give
us
bread
if
you
do
not
give
us
either
work
or
bread
then
we
shall
take
bread
it
was
a
very
wise
remark
to
make
to
the
state
of
new
york
that
is
wealth
and
its
the
police
but
i
fear
me
much
that
the
apostles
of
liberty
the
of
revolt
have
never
been
very
wise
there
is
a
record
of
a
seditious
person
who
once
upon
a
time
went
about
with
a
few
despised
followers
in
palestine
taking
corn
out
of
other
people
on
the
sabbath
day
too
that
same
person
when
he
wished
to
ride
into
jerusalem
told
his
disciples
to
go
forward
to
where
they
would
find
a
young
colt
tied
to
unloose
it
and
bring
it
to
him
and
if
any
one
interfered
or
said
anything
to
them
were
to
say
my
master
hath
need
of
it
that
same
person
said
give
to
him
that
asketh
of
thee
and
from
him
that
taketh
away
thy
goods
ask
them
not
back
again
that
same
person
once
stood
before
the
hungry
multitudes
of
galilee
and
taught
them
saying
the
scribes
and
the
pharisees
sit
in
moses
seat
therefore
whatever
they
bid
you
observe
that
observe
and
do
but
do
not
ye
after
their
works
for
they
say
and
do
not
for
they
bind
heavy
burdens
and
grievous
to
be
borne
and
lay
them
on
men
shoulders
but
they
themselves
will
not
move
them
with
one
of
their
fingers
but
all
their
works
they
do
to
be
seen
of
men
they
make
broad
their
phylacteries
and
enlarge
the
borders
of
their
garments
and
love
the
uppermost
rooms
at
feasts
and
the
chief
seats
in
the
synagogues
and
greeting
in
the
markets
and
to
be
called
of
men
rabbi
and
turning
to
the
scribes
and
the
pharisees
he
continued
woe
unto
you
scribes
and
pharisees
hypocrites
for
ye
devour
widows
houses
and
for
a
pretense
make
long
prayers
therefore
shall
ye
receive
the
greater
damnation
woe
unto
you
scribes
and
pharisees
hypocrites
for
ye
pay
tithe
of
mint
and
anise
and
cummin
and
have
omitted
the
weightier
matters
of
the
law
judgement
and
mercy
and
faith
these
ought
ye
to
have
done
and
not
left
the
other
undone
ye
blind
guides
that
strain
at
a
gnat
and
swallow
a
camel
woe
unto
you
scribes
and
pharisees
hypocrites
for
ye
make
clean
the
outside
of
the
cup
and
platter
but
within
they
are
full
of
extortion
and
excess
woe
unto
you
scribes
and
pharisees
hypocrites
for
ye
are
like
unto
whited
sepulchres
which
indeed
appear
beautiful
outward
but
within
are
full
of
dead
men
bones
and
all
uncleanness
even
so
ye
outwardly
appear
righteous
unto
men
but
within
ye
are
full
of
hypocrisy
and
iniquity
woe
unto
you
scribes
and
pharisees
hypocrites
because
ye
build
the
tombs
of
the
prophets
and
garnish
the
sepulchres
of
the
righteous
and
say
we
had
been
in
the
days
of
our
fathers
we
would
not
have
been
partakers
with
them
in
the
blood
of
the
prophets
wherefore
ye
be
witnesses
unto
yourselves
that
ye
are
the
children
of
them
which
killed
the
prophets
fill
ye
up
then
the
measure
of
your
fathers
ye
serpents
ye
generation
of
vipers
how
can
ye
escape
the
damnation
of
hell
yes
these
are
the
words
of
the
outlaw
who
is
alleged
to
form
the
foundation
stone
of
modern
civilization
to
the
authorities
of
his
day
hypocrites
extortionists
doers
of
iniquity
robbers
of
the
poor
serpents
vipers
fit
for
hell
it
was
a
very
wise
speech
from
beginning
to
end
perhaps
he
knew
it
when
he
stood
before
pilate
to
receive
his
sentence
when
he
bore
his
heavy
crucifix
up
calvary
when
nailed
upon
it
stretched
in
agony
he
cried
my
god
my
god
why
hast
thou
forsaken
me
no
it
was
wise
but
it
was
very
grand
this
grand
foolish
person
this
this
thief
who
justified
the
action
of
hunger
this
man
who
set
the
right
of
property
beneath
his
foot
this
individual
who
defied
the
state
do
you
know
why
he
was
so
feared
and
hated
and
punished
because
as
it
is
said
in
the
record
the
common
people
heard
him
gladly
and
the
accusation
before
pontius
pilate
was
we
found
this
fellow
perverting
the
whole
nation
he
stirreth
up
the
people
teaching
throughout
all
jewry
ah
the
dreaded
common
people
when
cardinal
manning
wrote
necessity
knows
no
law
and
a
starving
man
has
a
natural
right
to
a
share
of
his
neighbor
bread
who
thought
of
arresting
cardinal
manning
his
was
a
carefully
written
article
in
the
who
read
it
not
the
people
who
needed
bread
without
food
in
their
stomachs
they
had
not
fifty
cents
to
spend
for
a
magazine
it
was
not
the
voice
of
the
people
themselves
asserting
their
rights
no
one
for
one
instant
imagined
that
cardinal
manning
would
put
himself
at
the
head
of
ten
thousand
hungry
men
to
loot
the
bakeries
of
london
it
was
a
piece
of
ethical
to
be
discussed
in
speeches
by
the
gentlemen
who
think
themselves
most
competent
to
consider
such
subjects
when
their
are
spoiled
by
the
vomit
of
gluttony
and
drunkenness
but
when
stood
in
union
square
and
said
if
they
do
not
give
you
work
or
bread
take
bread
the
common
people
heard
her
gladly
and
as
of
old
the
wandering
carpenter
of
nazareth
addressed
his
own
class
teaching
throughout
all
jewry
stirring
up
the
people
against
the
authorities
so
the
dressmaker
of
new
york
addressing
the
unemployed
of
new
york
was
the
menace
of
the
depths
of
society
crying
in
its
own
tongue
the
authorities
heard
and
were
afraid
therefore
the
triple
wall
it
is
the
old
old
story
when
thomas
paine
one
hundred
years
ago
published
the
first
part
of
the
rights
of
man
the
part
in
which
he
discusses
principles
only
the
edition
was
a
one
reaching
comparatively
few
readers
it
created
only
a
literary
furore
when
the
second
part
appeared
the
part
in
which
he
treats
of
the
application
of
principles
in
which
he
declares
that
men
should
not
petition
for
rights
but
take
them
it
came
out
in
a
cheap
form
so
that
one
hundred
thousand
copies
were
sold
in
a
few
weeks
that
brought
down
the
prosecution
of
the
government
it
had
reached
the
people
that
might
act
and
prosecution
followed
prosecution
till
botany
bay
was
full
of
the
best
men
of
england
thus
were
the
limitations
of
speech
and
press
declared
and
thus
will
they
ever
be
declared
so
long
as
there
are
antagonistic
interests
in
human
society
understand
me
clearly
i
believe
that
the
term
constitutional
right
of
free
speech
is
a
meaningless
phrase
for
this
reason
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
the
declaration
of
independence
and
particularly
the
latter
were
in
their
day
progressive
expressions
of
progressive
ideals
but
they
are
throughout
characterized
by
the
metaphysical
philosophy
which
dominated
the
thought
of
the
last
century
they
speak
of
inherent
rights
inalienable
rights
natural
rights
etc
they
declare
that
men
are
equal
because
of
a
supposed
metaphysical
called
equality
existing
in
some
mysterious
way
apart
from
material
conditions
just
as
the
philosophers
of
the
eighteenth
century
accounted
for
water
being
wet
by
alleging
a
metaphysical
wetness
existing
somehow
apart
from
matter
i
do
not
say
this
to
disparage
those
grand
men
who
dared
to
put
themselves
against
the
authorities
of
the
monarchy
and
to
conceive
a
better
ideal
of
society
one
which
they
certainly
thought
would
secure
equal
rights
to
men
because
i
realize
fully
that
no
one
can
live
very
far
in
advance
of
the
and
i
am
positive
in
my
own
mind
that
unless
some
cataclysm
destroys
the
human
race
before
the
end
of
the
twentieth
century
the
experience
of
the
next
hundred
years
will
explode
many
of
our
own
theories
but
the
experience
of
this
age
has
proven
that
metaphysical
quantities
do
not
exist
apart
from
materials
and
hence
humanity
can
not
be
made
equal
by
declarations
on
paper
unless
the
material
conditions
for
equality
exist
it
is
worse
than
mockery
to
pronounce
men
equal
and
unless
there
is
equality
and
by
equality
i
mean
equal
chances
for
every
one
to
make
the
most
of
himself
unless
i
say
these
equal
chances
exist
freedom
either
of
thought
speech
or
action
is
equally
a
mockery
i
once
read
that
one
million
angels
could
dance
at
the
same
time
on
the
point
of
a
needle
possibly
one
million
angels
might
be
able
to
get
a
decent
night
lodging
by
virtue
of
their
constitutional
rights
one
single
tramp
could
and
whenever
the
tongues
of
the
class
threaten
the
possessors
whenever
the
disinherited
menace
the
privileged
that
moment
you
will
find
that
the
constitution
is
made
for
you
therefore
i
think
anarchists
make
a
mistake
when
they
contend
for
their
constitutional
rights
as
a
prominent
lawyer
thomas
earle
white
of
philadelphia
himself
an
anarchist
said
to
me
not
long
since
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
go
into
the
courts
and
fight
for
your
legal
rights
anarchists
have
got
any
well
says
the
governmentalist
you
ca
consistently
claim
any
you
do
believe
in
constitutions
and
laws
exactly
so
and
if
any
one
will
right
my
constitutional
wrongs
i
will
willingly
make
him
a
present
of
my
constitutional
rights
at
the
same
time
i
am
perfectly
sure
no
one
will
ever
make
this
exchange
nor
will
any
help
ever
come
to
the
wronged
class
from
the
outside
salvation
on
the
vicarious
plan
is
worth
despising
redress
of
wrongs
will
not
come
by
petitioning
the
powers
that
be
he
has
rights
who
dare
maintain
them
the
lord
helps
them
who
help
themselves
and
when
one
is
able
to
help
himself
i
think
he
is
apt
to
trouble
the
lord
much
for
his
assistance
as
long
as
the
working
people
fold
hands
and
pray
the
gods
in
washington
to
give
them
work
so
long
they
will
not
get
it
so
long
as
they
tramp
the
streets
whose
stones
they
lay
whose
filth
they
clean
whose
sewers
they
dig
yet
upon
which
they
must
not
stand
too
long
lest
the
policeman
bid
them
move
on
so
long
as
they
go
from
factory
to
factory
begging
for
the
opportunity
to
be
a
slave
receiving
the
insults
of
bosses
and
foremen
getting
the
old
no
the
old
shake
of
the
head
in
these
factories
which
they
build
whose
machines
they
wrought
so
long
as
they
consent
to
herd
like
cattle
in
the
cities
driven
year
after
year
more
and
more
off
the
mortgaged
land
the
land
they
cleared
fertilized
cultivated
rendered
of
value
so
long
as
they
stand
shivering
gazing
through
plate
glass
windows
at
overcoats
which
they
made
but
can
not
buy
starving
in
the
midst
of
food
they
produced
but
can
not
have
so
long
as
they
continue
to
do
these
things
vaguely
relying
upon
some
power
outside
themselves
be
it
god
or
priest
or
politician
or
employer
or
charitable
society
to
remedy
matters
so
long
deliverance
will
be
delayed
when
they
conceive
the
possibility
of
a
complete
international
federation
of
labor
whose
constituent
groups
shall
take
possession
of
land
mines
factories
all
the
instruments
of
production
issue
their
own
certificates
of
exchange
and
in
short
conduct
their
own
industry
without
regulative
interference
from
or
employers
then
we
may
hope
for
the
only
help
which
counts
for
aught
the
only
condition
which
can
guarantee
free
speech
and
no
paper
guarantee
needed
but
meanwhile
while
we
are
waiting
for
there
is
yet
much
grist
of
the
middle
class
to
be
ground
between
the
upper
and
nether
millstones
of
economic
evolution
while
we
await
the
formation
of
the
international
labor
trust
while
we
watch
for
the
day
when
there
are
enough
of
people
with
nothing
in
their
stomachs
and
desperation
in
their
heads
to
go
about
the
work
of
expropriation
what
shall
those
do
who
are
starving
now
that
is
the
question
which
had
to
face
and
she
answered
it
by
saying
ask
and
if
you
do
not
receive
take
take
bread
i
do
not
give
you
that
advice
not
because
i
do
not
think
the
bread
belongs
to
you
not
because
i
do
not
think
you
would
be
morally
right
in
taking
it
not
that
i
am
not
more
shocked
and
horrified
and
embittered
by
the
report
of
one
human
being
starving
in
the
heart
of
plenty
than
by
all
the
pittsburgs
and
chicagos
and
homesteads
and
tennessees
and
coeur
and
buffalos
and
barcelonas
and
parises
not
that
i
do
not
think
one
little
bit
of
sensitive
human
flesh
is
worth
all
the
property
rights
in
new
york
city
not
that
i
do
not
think
the
world
will
ever
be
saved
by
the
sheep
virtue
of
going
patiently
to
the
shambles
not
that
i
do
not
believe
the
expropriation
of
the
possessing
classes
is
inevitable
and
that
that
expropriation
will
begin
by
just
such
acts
as
advised
viz
the
taking
possession
of
wealth
already
produced
not
that
i
think
you
owe
any
consideration
to
the
conspirators
of
wall
street
or
those
who
profit
by
their
operations
as
such
nor
ever
will
till
they
are
reduced
to
the
level
of
human
beings
having
equal
chances
with
you
to
earn
their
share
of
social
wealth
and
no
more
i
have
said
that
i
do
not
give
you
the
advice
given
by
not
that
i
would
have
you
forget
the
consideration
the
expropriators
have
shown
to
you
that
they
have
advised
lead
for
strikers
strychnine
for
tramps
bread
and
water
as
good
enough
for
working
people
not
that
i
can
not
hear
yet
in
my
ears
the
words
of
one
who
said
to
me
of
the
studebaker
wagon
works
strikers
if
i
had
my
way
i
mow
them
down
with
gatling
guns
not
that
i
would
have
you
forget
the
electric
wire
of
fort
frick
nor
the
pinkertons
nor
the
militia
nor
the
prosecutions
for
murder
and
treason
not
that
i
would
have
you
forget
the
of
may
when
your
constitutional
right
of
free
speech
was
vindicated
nor
the
of
november
when
it
was
assassinated
not
that
i
would
have
you
forget
the
single
dinner
at
delmonico
which
ward
mcallister
tells
us
cost
ten
thousand
dollars
would
i
have
you
forget
that
the
wine
in
the
glasses
was
your
children
blood
it
must
be
a
rare
drink
children
blood
i
have
read
of
the
wonderful
sparkle
on
costly
champagne
i
have
never
seen
it
if
i
did
i
think
it
would
look
to
me
like
mothers
tears
over
the
little
white
wasted
forms
of
dead
babies
dead
because
there
was
no
milk
in
their
breasts
yes
i
want
you
to
remember
that
these
rich
are
tearers
of
human
flesh
gnawers
of
human
bones
yes
if
i
had
the
power
i
would
burn
your
wrongs
upon
your
hearts
in
characters
that
should
glow
like
coals
in
the
night
i
have
not
a
tongue
of
fire
as
has
i
can
not
stir
the
people
i
must
speak
in
my
own
cold
calculated
way
perhaps
that
is
the
reason
i
am
allowed
to
speak
at
all
but
if
i
had
the
power
my
will
is
good
enough
you
know
how
shakespeare
marc
antony
addressed
the
populace
at
rome
i
am
no
orator
as
brutus
is
but
as
you
know
me
well
a
plain
blunt
man
that
love
my
friend
and
that
they
know
full
well
that
gave
me
public
leave
to
speak
of
him
for
i
have
neither
wit
nor
words
nor
worth
action
nor
utterance
nor
the
power
of
speech
to
stir
men
blood
i
only
speak
right
on
i
tell
you
that
which
you
yourselves
do
know
show
you
sweet
cæsar
wounds
poor
poor
dumb
mouths
and
bid
them
speak
for
me
but
were
i
brutus
and
brutus
antony
there
were
an
antony
would
ruffle
up
your
spirits
and
put
a
tongue
in
every
wound
of
cæsar
that
should
move
the
stones
of
rome
to
rise
and
mutiny
if
therefore
i
do
not
give
you
the
advice
which
gave
let
not
the
authorities
suppose
it
is
because
i
have
any
more
respect
for
their
constitution
and
their
law
than
she
has
or
that
i
regard
them
as
having
any
rights
in
the
matter
no
my
reasons
for
not
giving
that
advice
are
two
first
if
i
were
giving
advice
at
all
i
would
say
my
friends
that
bread
belongs
to
you
it
is
you
who
toiled
and
sweat
in
the
sun
to
sow
and
reap
the
wheat
it
is
you
who
stood
by
the
thresher
and
breathed
the
atmosphere
in
the
mills
while
it
was
ground
to
flour
it
is
you
who
went
into
the
eternal
night
of
the
mine
and
risked
drowning
fire
damp
explosion
and
to
get
the
fuel
for
the
fire
that
baked
it
it
is
you
who
stood
in
the
heat
and
struck
the
blows
that
forged
the
iron
for
the
ovens
wherein
it
is
baked
it
is
you
who
stand
all
night
in
the
terrible
cellar
shops
and
tend
the
machines
that
knead
the
flour
into
dough
it
is
you
you
you
farmer
miner
mechanic
who
make
the
bread
but
you
have
the
power
to
take
it
at
every
transformation
wrought
by
toil
some
one
who
did
toil
has
taken
part
from
you
and
now
he
has
it
all
and
you
have
the
power
to
take
it
back
you
are
told
you
have
the
power
because
you
have
the
numbers
never
make
so
silly
a
blunder
as
to
suppose
that
power
resides
in
numbers
one
good
policeman
with
a
club
is
worth
ten
excited
unarmed
men
one
detachment
of
militia
has
a
power
equal
to
that
of
the
greatest
mob
that
could
be
raised
in
new
york
city
do
you
know
i
admire
compact
concentrated
power
let
me
give
you
an
illustration
out
in
a
little
town
in
illinois
there
is
a
certain
capitalist
and
if
ever
a
human
creature
sweat
and
ground
the
grist
of
gold
from
the
muscle
of
man
it
is
he
well
once
upon
a
time
his
workmen
not
his
slaves
his
workmen
were
on
strike
and
fifteen
hundred
muscular
polacks
armed
with
stones
pokers
and
other
such
crude
weapons
as
a
mob
generally
collects
went
up
to
his
house
for
the
purpose
of
smashing
the
windows
and
so
forth
possibly
to
do
as
those
people
in
italy
did
the
other
day
with
the
sheriff
who
attempted
to
collect
the
milk
tax
he
alone
one
man
met
them
on
the
steps
of
his
porch
and
for
two
mortal
hours
by
threats
promises
cajoleries
held
those
fifteen
hundred
poles
at
bay
and
finally
they
went
away
without
smashing
a
pane
of
glass
or
harming
a
hair
of
his
head
now
that
was
power
and
you
ca
help
but
admire
it
no
matter
if
it
was
your
enemy
who
displayed
it
and
you
must
admit
that
so
long
as
numbers
can
be
overcome
by
such
relative
quantity
power
does
not
reside
in
numbers
therefore
if
i
were
giving
advice
i
would
not
say
take
bread
but
take
counsel
with
yourselves
how
to
get
the
power
to
take
bread
there
is
no
doubt
but
that
power
is
latently
in
you
there
is
no
doubt
it
can
be
developed
there
is
no
doubt
the
authorities
know
this
and
fear
it
and
are
ready
to
exert
as
much
force
as
is
necessary
to
repress
any
signs
of
its
development
and
this
is
the
explanation
of
imprisonment
the
authorities
do
not
fear
you
as
you
are
they
only
fear
what
you
may
become
the
dangerous
thing
was
the
voice
crying
in
the
wilderness
foretelling
the
power
which
was
to
come
after
it
you
should
have
seen
how
they
feared
it
in
philadelphia
they
got
out
a
whole
platoon
of
police
and
detectives
and
executed
a
military
manoeuvre
to
catch
the
woman
who
had
been
running
around
under
their
noses
for
three
days
and
when
she
walked
up
to
them
then
they
surrounded
and
captured
her
and
guarded
the
city
hall
where
they
kept
her
over
night
and
put
a
detective
in
the
next
cell
to
make
notes
why
so
much
fear
did
they
shrink
from
the
stab
of
the
dressmaker
needle
or
did
they
dread
some
stronger
weapon
ah
the
accusation
before
the
new
york
pontius
pilate
was
she
stirreth
up
the
people
and
pilate
sentenced
her
to
the
full
limit
of
the
law
because
he
said
you
are
more
than
ordinarily
intelligent
why
is
intelligence
dealt
thus
harshly
with
because
it
is
the
beginning
of
power
strive
then
for
power
my
second
reason
for
not
repeating
words
is
that
i
as
an
anarchist
have
no
right
to
advise
another
to
do
anything
involving
a
risk
to
himself
nor
would
i
give
a
fillip
for
an
action
done
by
the
advice
of
some
one
else
unless
it
is
accompanied
by
a
well
settled
conviction
on
the
part
of
the
person
acting
that
it
really
is
the
best
thing
to
do
anarchism
to
me
means
not
only
the
denial
of
authority
not
only
a
new
economy
but
a
revision
of
the
principles
of
morality
it
means
the
development
of
the
individual
as
well
as
the
assertion
of
the
individual
it
means
and
not
i
say
it
is
your
business
to
decide
whether
you
will
starve
and
freeze
in
sight
of
food
and
clothing
outside
of
jail
or
commit
some
overt
act
against
the
institution
of
property
and
take
your
place
beside
and
and
in
saying
this
i
mean
to
cast
no
reflection
whatever
upon
for
doing
otherwise
she
and
i
hold
many
different
views
on
both
economy
and
morals
and
that
she
is
honest
in
hers
she
has
proved
better
than
i
have
proved
mine
is
a
communist
i
am
an
individualist
she
wishes
to
destroy
the
right
of
property
i
wish
to
assert
it
i
make
my
war
upon
privilege
and
authority
whereby
the
right
of
property
the
true
right
in
that
which
is
proper
to
the
individual
is
annihilated
she
believes
that
would
entirely
supplant
competition
i
hold
that
competition
in
one
form
or
another
will
always
exist
and
that
it
is
highly
desirable
it
should
but
whether
she
or
i
be
right
or
both
of
us
be
wrong
of
one
thing
i
am
sure
spirit
which
animates
emma
goldman
is
the
only
one
which
will
emancipate
the
slave
from
his
slavery
the
tyrant
from
his
tyranny
the
spirit
which
is
willing
to
dare
and
that
which
dwells
in
the
frail
body
in
the
is
not
the
new
york
dressmaker
alone
transport
yourselves
there
in
thought
a
moment
look
steadily
into
those
fair
blue
eyes
upon
the
hair
the
face
the
restless
hands
the
woman
figure
look
steadily
till
in
place
of
the
person
the
individual
of
time
and
place
you
see
that
which
transcends
time
and
place
and
flits
from
house
to
house
of
life
mocking
at
death
swinburne
in
his
magnificent
before
a
crucifix
says
with
iron
for
thy
linen
bands
and
unclean
cloths
for
they
bind
the
people
hands
they
hide
the
people
feet
and
what
man
or
what
angel
known
shall
roll
back
the
sepulchral
stone
perhaps
in
the
presence
of
this
untrammeled
spirit
we
shall
feel
that
something
has
rolled
back
the
sepulchral
stone
and
up
from
the
cold
wind
of
the
grave
is
borne
the
breath
that
animated
and
all
those
known
and
unknown
who
have
died
by
tree
and
axe
and
fagot
or
dragged
out
forgotten
lives
in
dungeons
derided
hated
tortured
by
men
perhaps
we
shall
know
ourselves
face
to
face
with
that
which
leaps
from
the
throat
of
the
strangled
when
the
rope
chokes
which
smokes
up
from
the
blood
of
the
murdered
when
the
axe
falls
that
which
has
been
forever
hunted
fettered
imprisoned
exiled
executed
and
never
conquered
lo
from
its
many
incarnations
it
comes
forth
again
the
immortal
of
the
ages
the
gloomy
walls
are
glorified
thereby
the
prisoner
is
transfigured
and
we
say
reverently
we
say
o
sacred
head
o
desecrate
o
feet
and
hands
o
blood
poured
forth
in
pledge
to
fate
of
nameless
lives
in
divers
lands
o
slain
and
spent
and
sacrificed
people
the
speechless
christ
direct
action
from
the
standpoint
of
one
who
thinks
himself
capable
of
discerning
an
undeviating
route
for
human
progress
to
pursue
if
it
is
to
be
progress
at
all
who
having
such
a
route
on
his
mind
map
has
endeavored
to
point
it
out
to
others
to
make
them
see
it
as
he
sees
it
who
in
so
doing
has
chosen
what
appeared
to
him
clear
and
simple
expressions
to
convey
his
thoughts
to
others
to
such
a
one
it
appears
matter
for
regret
and
confusion
of
spirit
that
the
phrase
direct
action
has
suddenly
acquired
in
the
general
mind
a
circumscribed
meaning
not
at
all
implied
in
the
words
themselves
and
certainly
never
attached
to
it
by
himself
or
his
however
this
is
one
of
the
common
jests
which
progress
plays
on
those
who
think
themselves
able
to
set
metes
and
bounds
for
it
over
and
over
again
names
phrases
mottoes
watchwords
have
been
turned
inside
out
and
upside
down
and
hindside
before
and
sideways
by
occurrences
out
of
the
control
of
those
who
used
the
expressions
in
their
proper
sense
and
still
those
who
sturdily
held
their
ground
and
insisted
on
being
heard
have
in
the
end
found
that
the
period
of
misunderstanding
and
prejudice
has
been
but
the
prelude
to
wider
inquiry
and
understanding
i
rather
think
this
will
be
the
case
with
the
present
misconception
of
the
term
direct
action
which
through
the
misapprehension
or
else
the
deliberate
misrepresentation
of
certain
journalists
in
los
angeles
at
the
time
the
mcnamaras
pleaded
guilty
suddenly
acquired
in
the
popular
mind
the
interpretation
forcible
attacks
on
life
and
property
this
was
either
very
ignorant
or
very
dishonest
of
the
journalists
but
it
has
had
the
effect
of
making
a
good
many
people
curious
to
know
all
about
direct
action
as
a
matter
of
fact
those
who
are
so
lustily
and
so
inordinately
condemning
it
will
find
on
examination
that
they
themselves
have
on
many
occasions
practised
direct
action
and
will
do
so
again
every
person
who
ever
thought
he
had
a
right
to
assert
and
went
boldly
and
asserted
it
himself
or
jointly
with
others
that
shared
his
convictions
was
a
direct
actionist
some
thirty
years
ago
i
recall
that
the
salvation
army
was
vigorously
practising
direct
action
in
the
maintenance
of
the
freedom
of
its
members
to
speak
assemble
and
pray
over
and
over
they
were
arrested
fined
and
imprisoned
but
they
kept
right
on
singing
praying
and
marching
till
they
finally
compelled
their
persecutors
to
let
them
alone
the
industrial
workers
are
now
conducting
the
same
fight
and
have
in
a
number
of
cases
compelled
the
officials
to
let
them
alone
by
the
same
direct
tactics
every
person
who
ever
had
a
plan
to
do
anything
and
went
and
did
it
or
who
laid
his
plan
before
others
and
won
their
to
do
it
with
him
without
going
to
external
authorities
to
please
do
the
thing
for
them
was
a
direct
actionist
all
experiments
are
essentially
direct
action
every
person
who
ever
in
his
life
had
a
difference
with
any
one
to
settle
and
went
straight
to
the
other
persons
involved
to
settle
it
either
by
a
peaceable
plan
or
otherwise
was
a
direct
actionist
examples
of
such
action
are
strikes
and
boycotts
many
persons
will
recall
the
action
of
the
housewives
of
new
york
who
boycotted
the
butchers
and
lowered
the
price
of
meat
at
the
present
moment
a
butter
boycott
seems
looming
up
as
a
direct
reply
to
the
for
butter
these
actions
are
generally
not
due
to
any
one
reasoning
overmuch
on
the
respective
merits
of
directness
or
indirectness
but
are
the
spontaneous
retorts
of
those
who
feel
oppressed
by
a
situation
in
other
words
all
people
are
most
of
the
time
believers
in
the
principle
of
direct
action
and
practisers
of
it
however
most
people
are
also
indirect
or
political
actionists
and
they
are
both
these
things
at
the
same
time
without
making
much
of
an
analysis
of
either
there
are
only
a
limited
number
of
persons
who
eschew
political
action
under
any
and
all
circumstances
but
there
is
nobody
nobody
at
all
who
has
ever
been
so
impossible
as
to
eschew
direct
action
altogether
the
majority
of
thinking
people
are
really
opportunists
leaning
some
perhaps
more
to
directness
some
more
to
indirectness
as
a
general
thing
but
ready
to
use
either
means
when
opportunity
calls
for
it
that
is
to
say
there
are
those
who
hold
that
balloting
governors
into
power
is
essentially
a
wrong
and
foolish
thing
but
who
nevertheless
under
stress
of
special
circumstance
might
consider
it
the
wisest
thing
to
do
to
vote
some
individual
into
office
at
that
particular
time
or
there
are
those
who
believe
that
in
general
the
wisest
way
for
people
to
get
what
they
want
is
by
the
indirect
method
of
voting
into
power
some
one
who
will
make
what
they
want
legal
yet
who
all
the
same
will
occasionally
under
exceptional
conditions
advise
a
strike
and
a
strike
as
i
have
said
is
direct
action
or
they
may
do
as
the
socialist
party
agitators
who
are
mostly
declaiming
now
against
direct
action
did
last
summer
when
the
police
were
holding
up
their
meetings
they
went
in
force
to
the
prepared
to
speak
and
they
made
the
police
back
down
and
while
that
was
not
logical
on
their
part
thus
to
oppose
the
legal
executors
of
the
majority
will
it
was
a
fine
successful
piece
of
direct
action
those
who
by
the
essence
of
their
belief
are
committed
to
direct
action
only
are
just
who
why
the
precisely
those
who
do
not
believe
in
violence
at
all
now
do
not
make
the
mistake
of
inferring
that
i
say
direct
action
means
not
by
any
means
direct
action
may
be
the
extreme
of
violence
or
it
may
be
as
peaceful
as
the
waters
of
the
brook
of
siloa
that
go
softly
what
i
say
is
that
the
real
can
believe
in
direct
action
only
never
in
political
action
for
the
basis
of
all
political
action
is
coercion
even
when
the
state
does
good
things
it
finally
rests
on
a
club
a
gun
or
a
prison
for
its
power
to
carry
them
through
now
every
school
child
in
the
united
states
has
had
the
direct
action
of
certain
brought
to
his
notice
by
his
school
history
the
case
which
every
one
instantly
recalls
is
that
of
the
early
quakers
who
came
to
massachusetts
the
puritans
had
accused
the
quakers
of
troubling
the
world
by
preaching
peace
to
it
they
refused
to
pay
church
taxes
they
refused
to
bear
arms
they
refused
to
swear
allegiance
to
any
government
in
so
doing
they
were
direct
actionists
what
we
may
call
negative
direct
actionists
so
the
puritans
being
political
actionists
passed
laws
to
keep
them
out
to
deport
to
fine
to
imprison
to
mutilate
and
finally
to
hang
them
and
the
quakers
just
kept
on
coming
which
was
positive
direct
action
and
history
records
that
after
the
hanging
of
four
quakers
and
the
flogging
of
margaret
brewster
at
the
cart
tail
through
the
streets
of
boston
the
puritans
gave
up
trying
to
silence
the
new
missionaries
that
quaker
persistence
and
quaker
had
won
the
day
another
example
of
direct
action
in
early
colonial
history
but
this
time
by
no
means
of
the
peaceable
sort
was
the
affair
known
as
rebellion
all
our
historians
certainly
defend
the
action
of
the
rebels
in
that
matter
as
reason
is
for
they
were
right
and
yet
it
was
a
case
of
violent
direct
action
against
lawfully
constituted
authority
for
the
benefit
of
those
who
have
forgotten
the
details
let
me
briefly
remind
them
that
the
virginia
planters
were
in
fear
of
a
general
attack
by
the
indians
with
reason
being
political
actionists
they
asked
or
bacon
as
their
leader
asked
that
the
governor
grant
him
a
commission
to
raise
volunteers
in
their
own
defense
the
governor
feared
that
such
a
company
of
armed
men
would
be
a
threat
to
him
also
with
reason
he
refused
the
commission
whereupon
the
planters
resorted
to
direct
action
they
raised
the
volunteers
without
the
commission
and
successfully
fought
off
the
indians
bacon
was
pronounced
a
traitor
by
the
governor
but
the
people
being
with
him
the
governor
was
afraid
to
proceed
against
him
in
the
end
however
it
came
so
far
that
the
rebels
burned
jamestown
and
but
for
the
untimely
death
of
bacon
much
more
might
have
been
done
of
course
the
reaction
was
very
dreadful
as
it
usually
is
where
a
rebellion
collapses
or
is
crushed
yet
even
during
the
brief
period
of
success
it
had
corrected
a
good
many
abuses
i
am
quite
sure
that
the
advocates
of
those
times
after
the
reaction
came
back
into
power
must
have
said
see
to
what
evils
direct
action
brings
us
behold
the
progress
of
the
colony
has
been
set
back
years
forgetting
that
if
the
colonists
had
not
resorted
to
direct
action
their
scalps
would
have
been
taken
by
the
indians
a
year
sooner
instead
of
a
number
of
them
being
hanged
by
the
governor
a
year
later
in
the
period
of
agitation
and
excitement
preceding
the
revolution
there
were
all
sorts
and
kinds
of
direct
action
from
the
most
peaceable
to
the
most
violent
and
i
believe
that
almost
everybody
who
studies
united
states
history
finds
the
account
of
these
performances
the
most
interesting
part
of
the
story
the
part
which
dents
into
his
memory
most
easily
among
the
peaceable
moves
made
were
the
agreements
the
leagues
for
wearing
homespun
clothing
and
the
committees
of
correspondence
as
the
inevitable
growth
of
hostility
progressed
violent
direct
action
developed
in
the
matter
of
destroying
the
revenue
stamps
or
the
action
concerning
the
either
by
not
permitting
the
tea
to
be
landed
or
by
putting
it
in
damp
storage
or
by
throwing
it
into
the
harbor
as
in
boston
or
by
compelling
a
owner
to
set
fire
to
his
own
ship
as
at
annapolis
these
are
all
actions
which
our
commonest
record
certainly
not
in
a
condemnatory
way
not
even
in
an
apologetic
one
though
they
are
all
cases
of
direct
action
against
legally
constituted
authority
and
property
rights
if
i
draw
attention
to
them
and
others
of
like
nature
it
is
to
prove
to
unreflecting
repeaters
of
words
that
action
has
always
been
used
and
has
the
historical
sanction
of
the
very
people
now
reprobating
george
washington
is
said
to
have
been
the
leader
of
the
virginia
planters
league
he
would
now
be
enjoined
probably
by
a
court
from
forming
any
such
league
and
if
he
persisted
he
would
be
fined
for
contempt
when
the
great
quarrel
between
the
north
and
the
south
was
waxing
hot
and
hotter
it
was
again
direct
action
which
preceded
and
precipitated
political
action
and
i
may
remark
here
that
political
action
is
never
taken
nor
even
contemplated
until
slumbering
minds
have
first
been
aroused
by
direct
acts
of
protest
against
existing
conditions
the
history
of
the
movement
and
the
civil
war
is
one
of
the
greatest
of
paradoxes
although
history
is
a
chain
of
paradoxes
politically
speaking
it
was
the
states
that
stood
for
greater
political
freedom
for
the
autonomy
of
the
single
state
against
the
interference
of
the
united
states
politically
speaking
it
was
the
states
that
stood
for
a
strong
centralized
government
which
secessionists
said
and
said
truly
was
bound
progressively
to
develop
into
more
and
more
tyrannical
forms
which
happened
from
the
close
of
the
civil
war
on
there
has
been
continuous
encroachment
of
the
federal
power
upon
what
was
formerly
the
concern
of
the
states
individually
the
in
their
struggles
of
are
continually
thrown
into
conflict
with
that
centralized
power
against
which
the
protested
with
liberty
on
his
lips
but
tyranny
in
his
heart
ethically
speaking
it
was
the
states
that
in
a
general
way
stood
for
greater
human
liberty
while
the
secessionists
stood
for
in
a
general
way
only
that
is
the
majority
of
northerners
not
being
accustomed
to
the
actual
presence
of
negro
slavery
about
them
thought
it
was
probably
a
mistake
yet
they
were
in
no
great
ferment
of
anxiety
to
have
it
abolished
the
abolitionists
only
and
they
were
relatively
few
were
the
genuine
ethicals
to
whom
slavery
itself
not
secession
or
union
was
the
main
question
in
fact
so
paramount
was
it
with
them
that
a
considerable
number
of
them
were
themselves
for
the
dissolution
of
the
union
advocating
that
the
north
take
the
initiative
in
the
matter
of
dissolving
in
order
that
the
northern
people
might
shake
off
the
blame
of
holding
negroes
in
chains
of
course
there
were
all
sorts
of
people
with
all
sorts
of
temperaments
among
those
who
advocated
the
abolition
of
slavery
there
were
quakers
like
whittier
indeed
it
was
the
quakers
who
had
advocated
abolition
even
in
early
colonial
days
there
were
moderate
political
actionists
who
were
for
buying
off
the
slaves
as
the
cheapest
way
and
there
were
extremely
violent
people
who
believed
and
did
all
sorts
of
violent
things
as
to
what
the
politicians
did
it
is
one
long
record
of
a
record
of
thirty
years
of
compromising
and
dickering
and
trying
to
keep
what
was
as
it
was
and
to
hand
sops
to
both
sides
when
new
conditions
demanded
that
something
be
done
or
be
pretended
to
be
done
but
the
stars
in
their
courses
fought
against
sisera
the
system
was
breaking
down
from
within
and
the
direct
actionists
from
without
as
well
were
widening
the
cracks
remorselessly
among
the
various
expressions
of
direct
rebellion
was
the
organization
of
the
underground
railroad
most
of
the
people
who
belonged
to
it
believed
in
both
sorts
of
action
but
however
much
they
theoretically
subscribed
to
the
right
of
the
majority
to
enact
and
enforce
laws
they
did
believe
in
it
on
that
point
my
grandfather
was
a
member
of
the
underground
many
a
fugitive
slave
he
helped
on
his
way
to
canada
he
was
a
very
patient
man
in
most
respects
though
i
have
often
thought
he
probably
respected
it
because
he
did
have
much
to
do
with
it
always
leading
a
pioneer
life
law
was
generally
far
from
him
and
direct
action
imperative
be
that
as
it
may
and
as
he
was
he
had
no
respect
whatever
for
slave
laws
no
matter
if
made
by
ten
times
of
a
majority
and
he
conscientiously
broke
every
one
that
came
in
his
way
to
be
broken
there
were
times
when
in
the
operation
of
the
underground
violence
was
required
and
was
used
i
recollect
one
old
friend
relating
to
me
how
she
and
her
mother
kept
watch
all
night
at
the
door
while
a
slave
for
whom
a
posse
was
searching
hid
in
the
cellar
and
though
they
were
of
quaker
descent
and
sympathies
there
was
a
on
the
table
fortunately
it
did
not
have
to
be
used
that
night
when
the
fugitive
slave
law
was
passed
with
the
help
of
the
political
actionists
of
the
north
who
wanted
to
offer
a
new
sop
to
the
the
direct
actionists
took
to
rescuing
recaptured
fugitives
there
was
the
rescue
of
shadrach
and
the
rescue
of
jerry
the
latter
rescuers
being
led
by
the
famous
gerrit
smith
and
a
good
many
more
successful
and
unsuccessful
attempts
still
the
politicals
kept
on
pottering
and
trying
to
smooth
things
over
and
the
abolitionists
were
denounced
and
decried
by
the
pacificators
pretty
much
as
wm
haywood
and
frank
bohn
are
being
denounced
by
their
own
party
now
the
other
day
i
read
a
communication
in
the
chicago
from
the
secretary
of
the
louisville
local
socialist
party
to
the
national
secretary
requesting
that
some
safe
and
sane
speaker
be
substituted
for
bohn
who
had
been
announced
to
speak
there
in
explaining
why
dobbs
secretary
makes
this
quotation
from
lecture
had
the
mcnamaras
been
successful
in
defending
the
interests
of
the
working
class
they
would
have
been
right
just
as
john
brown
would
have
been
right
had
he
been
successful
in
freeing
the
slaves
ignorance
was
the
only
crime
of
john
brown
and
ignorance
was
the
only
crime
of
the
mcnamaras
upon
this
dobbs
comments
as
follows
we
dispute
emphatically
the
statements
here
made
the
attempt
to
draw
a
parallel
between
the
open
if
mistaken
revolt
of
john
brown
on
the
one
hand
and
the
secret
and
murderous
methods
of
the
mcnamaras
on
the
other
is
not
only
indicative
of
shallow
reasoning
but
highly
mischievous
in
the
logical
conclusions
which
may
be
drawn
from
such
statements
evidently
dobbs
is
very
ignorant
of
the
life
and
work
of
john
brown
john
brown
was
a
man
of
violence
he
would
have
scorned
attempt
to
make
him
out
anything
else
and
when
once
a
person
is
a
believer
in
violence
it
is
with
him
only
a
question
of
the
most
effective
way
of
applying
it
which
can
be
determined
only
by
a
knowledge
of
conditions
and
means
at
his
disposal
john
brown
did
not
shrink
at
all
from
conspiratical
methods
those
who
have
read
the
autobiography
of
frederick
douglas
and
the
reminiscences
of
lucy
colman
will
recall
that
one
of
the
plans
laid
by
john
brown
was
to
organize
a
chain
of
armed
camps
in
the
mountains
of
west
virginia
north
carolina
and
tennessee
send
secret
emissaries
among
the
slaves
inciting
them
to
flee
to
these
camps
and
there
concert
such
measures
as
times
and
conditions
made
possible
for
further
arousing
revolt
among
the
negroes
that
this
plan
failed
was
due
to
the
weakness
of
the
desire
for
liberty
among
the
slaves
themselves
more
than
anything
else
later
on
when
the
politicians
in
their
infinite
deviousness
contrived
a
fresh
proposition
of
known
as
the
act
which
left
the
question
of
slavery
to
be
determined
by
the
settlers
the
direct
actionists
on
both
sides
sent
bogus
settlers
into
the
territory
who
proceeded
to
fight
it
out
the
men
who
got
in
first
made
a
constitution
recognizing
slavery
and
a
law
punishing
with
death
any
one
who
aided
a
slave
to
escape
but
the
free
soilers
who
were
a
little
longer
in
arriving
since
they
came
from
more
distant
states
made
a
second
constitution
and
refused
to
recognize
the
other
laws
at
all
and
john
brown
was
there
mixing
in
all
the
violence
conspiratical
or
open
he
was
a
and
a
murderer
in
the
eyes
of
decent
peaceable
political
actionists
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
stole
horses
sending
no
notice
in
advance
of
his
intention
to
steal
them
and
that
he
killed
men
he
struck
and
got
away
a
good
many
times
before
his
final
attempt
on
harper
ferry
if
he
did
not
use
dynamite
it
was
because
dynamite
had
not
yet
appeared
as
a
practical
weapon
he
made
a
great
many
more
intentional
attacks
on
life
than
the
two
brothers
secretary
dobbs
condemns
for
their
murderous
methods
and
yet
history
has
not
failed
to
understand
john
brown
mankind
knows
that
though
he
was
a
violent
man
with
human
blood
upon
his
hands
who
was
guilty
of
high
treason
and
hanged
for
it
yet
his
soul
was
a
great
strong
unselfish
soul
unable
to
bear
the
frightful
crime
which
kept
people
like
dumb
beasts
and
thought
that
making
war
against
it
was
a
sacred
a
duty
for
john
brown
was
a
very
religious
man
a
presbyterian
it
is
by
and
because
of
the
direct
acts
of
the
of
social
change
whether
they
be
of
peaceful
or
warlike
nature
that
the
human
conscience
the
conscience
of
the
mass
becomes
aroused
to
the
need
for
change
it
would
be
very
stupid
to
say
that
no
good
results
are
ever
brought
about
by
political
action
sometimes
good
things
do
come
about
that
way
but
never
until
individual
rebellion
followed
by
mass
rebellion
has
forced
it
direct
action
is
always
the
clamorer
the
initiator
through
which
the
great
sum
of
indifferentists
become
aware
that
oppression
is
getting
intolerable
we
have
now
an
oppression
in
the
land
and
not
only
in
this
land
but
throughout
all
those
parts
of
the
world
which
enjoy
the
very
mixed
blessings
of
civilization
and
just
as
in
the
question
of
chattel
slavery
so
this
form
of
slavery
has
been
begetting
both
direct
action
and
political
action
a
certain
per
cent
of
our
population
probably
a
much
smaller
per
cent
than
politicians
are
in
the
habit
of
assigning
at
mass
meetings
is
producing
the
material
wealth
upon
which
all
the
rest
of
us
live
just
as
it
was
the
chattel
blacks
who
supported
all
the
crowd
of
parasites
above
them
these
are
the
and
the
through
the
unprophesied
and
unprophesiable
operation
of
institutions
which
no
individual
of
us
created
but
found
in
existence
when
he
came
here
these
workers
the
most
absolutely
necessary
part
of
the
whole
social
structure
without
whose
services
none
can
either
eat
or
clothe
or
shelter
himself
are
just
the
ones
who
get
the
least
to
eat
to
wear
and
to
be
housed
withal
to
say
nothing
of
their
share
of
the
other
social
benefits
which
the
rest
of
us
are
supposed
to
furnish
such
as
education
and
artistic
gratifications
these
workers
have
in
one
form
or
another
mutually
joined
their
forces
to
see
what
betterment
of
their
condition
they
could
get
primarily
by
direct
action
secondarily
through
political
action
we
have
had
the
grange
the
farmers
alliance
associations
colonization
experiments
knights
of
labor
trade
unions
and
industrial
workers
of
the
world
all
of
them
have
been
organized
for
the
purpose
of
wringing
from
the
masters
in
the
economic
field
a
little
better
price
a
little
better
conditions
a
little
shorter
hours
or
on
the
other
hand
to
resist
a
reduction
in
price
worse
conditions
or
longer
hours
none
of
them
has
attempted
a
final
solution
of
the
social
war
none
of
them
except
the
industrial
workers
has
recognized
that
there
is
a
social
war
inevitable
so
long
as
present
conditions
endure
they
accepted
property
institutions
as
they
found
them
they
were
made
up
of
average
men
with
average
desires
and
they
undertook
to
do
what
appeared
to
them
possible
and
very
reasonable
things
they
were
not
committed
to
any
particular
political
policy
when
they
were
organized
but
were
associated
for
direct
action
of
their
own
initiation
either
positive
or
defensive
undoubtedly
there
were
and
are
among
all
these
organizations
members
who
looked
beyond
immediate
demands
who
did
see
that
the
continuous
development
of
forces
now
in
operation
was
bound
to
bring
about
conditions
to
which
it
is
impossible
that
life
continue
to
submit
and
against
which
therefore
it
will
protest
and
violently
protest
that
it
will
have
no
choice
but
to
do
so
that
it
must
do
so
or
tamely
die
and
since
it
is
not
the
nature
of
life
to
surrender
without
struggle
it
will
not
tamely
die
years
ago
i
met
farmers
alliance
people
who
said
so
knights
of
labor
who
said
so
trade
unionists
who
said
so
they
wanted
larger
aims
than
those
to
which
their
organizations
were
looking
but
they
had
to
accept
their
fellow
members
as
they
were
and
try
to
stir
them
to
work
for
such
things
as
it
was
possible
to
make
them
see
and
what
they
could
see
was
better
prices
better
wages
less
dangerous
or
tyrannical
conditions
shorter
hours
at
the
stage
of
development
when
these
movements
were
initiated
the
land
workers
could
not
see
that
their
struggle
had
anything
to
do
with
the
struggle
of
those
engaged
in
the
manufacturing
or
transporting
service
nor
could
these
latter
see
that
theirs
had
anything
to
do
with
the
movement
of
the
farmers
for
that
matter
very
few
of
them
see
it
yet
they
have
yet
to
learn
that
there
is
one
common
struggle
against
those
who
have
appropriated
the
earth
the
money
and
the
machines
unfortunately
the
great
organization
of
the
farmers
frittered
itself
away
in
a
stupid
chase
after
political
power
it
was
quite
successful
in
getting
the
power
in
certain
states
but
the
courts
pronounced
its
laws
unconstitutional
and
there
was
the
burial
hole
of
all
its
political
conquests
its
original
program
was
to
build
its
own
elevators
and
store
the
products
therein
holding
these
from
the
market
till
they
could
escape
the
speculator
also
to
organize
labor
exchanges
issuing
credit
notes
upon
products
deposited
for
exchange
had
it
adhered
to
this
program
of
direct
mutual
aid
it
would
to
some
extent
for
a
time
at
least
have
afforded
an
illustration
of
how
mankind
may
free
itself
from
the
parasitism
of
the
bankers
and
the
middlemen
of
course
it
would
have
been
overthrown
in
the
end
unless
it
had
so
revolutionized
men
minds
by
the
example
as
to
force
the
overthrow
of
the
legal
monopoly
of
land
and
money
but
at
least
it
would
have
served
a
great
educational
purpose
as
it
was
it
went
after
the
red
herring
and
disintegrated
merely
from
its
futility
the
knights
of
labor
subsided
into
comparative
insignificance
not
because
of
failure
to
use
direct
action
nor
because
of
its
tampering
with
politics
which
was
small
but
chiefly
because
it
was
a
heterogeneous
mass
of
workers
who
could
not
associate
their
efforts
effectively
the
trade
unions
grew
strong
about
as
the
of
subsided
and
have
continued
slowly
but
persistently
to
increase
in
power
it
is
true
the
increase
has
fluctuated
that
there
have
been
that
great
single
organizations
have
been
formed
and
again
dispersed
but
on
the
whole
trade
unions
have
been
a
growing
power
they
have
been
so
because
poor
as
they
are
inefficient
as
they
are
they
have
been
a
means
whereby
a
certain
section
of
the
workers
have
been
able
to
bring
their
united
force
to
bear
directly
upon
their
masters
and
so
get
for
themselves
some
portion
of
what
they
wanted
of
what
their
conditions
dictated
to
them
they
must
try
to
get
the
strike
is
their
natural
weapon
that
which
they
themselves
forged
it
is
the
direct
blow
of
the
strike
which
nine
times
out
of
ten
the
boss
is
afraid
of
of
course
there
are
occasions
when
he
is
glad
of
one
but
that
unusual
and
the
reason
he
dreads
a
strike
is
not
so
much
because
he
thinks
he
can
not
win
out
against
it
but
simply
and
solely
because
he
does
not
want
an
interruption
of
his
business
the
ordinary
boss
is
in
much
dread
of
a
vote
there
are
plenty
of
shops
where
you
can
talk
socialism
or
any
other
political
program
all
day
long
but
if
you
begin
to
talk
unionism
you
may
forthwith
expect
to
be
discharged
or
at
best
warned
to
shut
up
why
not
because
the
boss
is
so
wise
as
to
know
that
political
action
is
a
swamp
in
which
the
workingman
gets
mired
or
because
he
understands
that
political
socialism
is
fast
becoming
a
movement
not
at
all
he
thinks
socialism
is
a
very
bad
thing
but
it
a
good
way
off
but
he
knows
that
if
his
shop
is
unionized
he
will
have
trouble
right
away
his
hands
will
be
rebellious
he
will
be
put
to
expense
to
improve
his
factory
conditions
he
will
have
to
keep
workingmen
that
he
does
like
and
in
case
of
strike
he
may
expect
injury
to
his
machinery
or
his
buildings
it
is
often
said
and
repeated
that
the
bosses
are
that
they
stick
together
for
their
class
interest
and
are
willing
to
undergo
any
sort
of
personal
loss
rather
than
be
false
to
those
interests
it
is
so
at
all
the
majority
of
business
people
are
just
like
the
majority
of
workingmen
they
care
a
whole
lot
more
about
their
individual
loss
or
gain
than
about
the
gain
or
loss
of
their
class
and
it
is
his
individual
loss
the
boss
sees
when
threatened
by
a
union
now
everybody
knows
that
a
strike
of
any
size
means
violence
no
matter
what
any
one
ethical
preference
for
peace
may
be
he
knows
it
will
not
be
peaceful
if
it
a
telegraph
strike
it
means
cutting
wires
and
poles
and
getting
fake
scabs
in
to
spoil
the
instruments
if
it
is
a
steel
rolling
mill
strike
it
means
beating
up
the
scabs
breaking
the
windows
setting
the
gauges
wrong
and
ruining
the
expensive
rollers
together
with
tons
and
tons
of
material
if
it
a
miners
strike
it
means
destroying
tracks
and
bridges
and
blowing
up
mills
if
it
is
a
garment
workers
strike
it
means
having
an
unaccountable
fire
getting
a
volley
of
stones
through
an
apparently
inaccessible
window
or
possibly
a
brickbat
on
the
manufacturer
own
head
if
it
a
strike
it
means
tracks
torn
up
or
barricaded
with
the
contents
of
and
with
overturned
wagons
or
stolen
fences
it
means
smashed
or
incinerated
cars
and
turned
switches
if
it
is
a
system
federation
strike
it
means
dead
engines
wild
engines
derailed
freights
and
stalled
trains
if
it
is
a
building
trades
strike
it
means
dynamited
structures
and
always
everywhere
all
the
time
fights
between
and
scabs
against
strikers
and
between
people
and
police
on
the
side
of
the
bosses
it
means
electric
wires
stockades
detectives
and
provocative
agents
violent
kidnapping
and
deportation
and
every
device
they
can
conceive
for
direct
protection
besides
the
ultimate
invocation
of
police
militia
state
constabulary
and
federal
troops
everybody
knows
this
everybody
smiles
when
union
officials
protest
their
organizations
to
be
peaceable
and
because
everybody
knows
they
are
lying
they
know
that
violence
is
used
both
secretly
and
openly
and
they
know
it
is
used
because
the
strikers
can
not
do
any
other
way
without
giving
up
the
fight
at
once
nor
do
they
mistake
those
who
thus
resort
to
violence
under
stress
for
destructive
miscreants
who
do
what
they
do
out
of
innate
cussedness
the
people
in
general
understand
that
they
do
these
things
through
the
harsh
logic
of
a
situation
which
they
did
not
create
but
which
forces
them
to
these
attacks
in
order
to
make
good
in
their
struggle
to
live
or
else
go
down
the
bottomless
descent
into
poverty
that
lets
death
find
them
in
the
poorhouse
hospital
the
city
street
or
the
this
is
the
awful
alternative
that
the
workers
are
facing
and
this
is
what
makes
the
most
kindly
disposed
human
beings
men
who
would
go
out
of
their
way
to
help
a
wounded
dog
or
bring
home
a
stray
kitten
and
nurse
it
or
step
aside
to
avoid
walking
on
a
worm
resort
to
violence
against
their
they
know
for
the
facts
have
taught
them
that
this
is
the
only
way
to
win
if
they
can
win
at
all
and
it
has
always
appeared
to
me
one
of
the
most
utterly
ludicrous
absolutely
irrelevant
things
that
a
person
can
do
or
say
when
approached
for
relief
or
assistance
by
a
striker
who
is
dealing
with
an
immediate
situation
to
respond
with
vote
yourself
into
power
when
the
next
election
is
six
months
a
year
or
two
years
away
unfortunately
the
people
who
know
best
how
violence
is
used
in
union
warfare
can
not
come
forward
and
say
on
such
a
day
at
such
a
place
such
and
such
a
specific
action
was
done
and
as
the
result
such
and
such
a
concession
was
made
or
such
and
such
a
boss
capitulated
to
do
so
would
imperil
their
liberty
and
their
power
to
go
on
fighting
therefore
those
that
know
best
must
keep
silent
and
sneer
in
their
sleeves
while
those
that
know
little
prate
events
not
tongues
must
make
their
position
clear
and
there
has
been
a
very
great
deal
of
prating
these
last
few
weeks
speakers
and
writers
honestly
convinced
i
believe
that
political
action
and
political
action
only
can
win
the
workers
battle
have
been
denouncing
what
they
are
pleased
to
call
direct
action
what
they
really
mean
is
conspiratical
violence
as
the
author
of
mischief
incalculable
one
oscar
ameringer
as
an
example
recently
said
at
a
meeting
in
chicago
that
the
haymarket
bomb
of
had
set
back
the
movement
years
arguing
that
the
movement
would
have
succeeded
then
but
for
the
bomb
it
a
great
mistake
no
one
can
exactly
measure
in
years
or
months
the
effect
of
a
forward
push
or
a
reaction
no
one
can
demonstrate
that
the
movement
could
have
been
won
years
ago
we
know
that
the
day
was
put
on
the
statute
books
of
illinois
in
by
political
action
and
has
remained
a
dead
letter
that
the
direct
action
of
the
workers
could
have
won
it
then
can
not
be
proved
but
it
can
be
shown
that
many
more
potent
factors
than
the
haymarket
bomb
worked
against
it
on
the
other
hand
if
the
reactive
influence
of
the
bomb
was
really
so
powerful
we
should
naturally
expect
labor
and
union
conditions
to
be
worse
in
chicago
than
in
the
cities
where
no
such
thing
happened
on
the
contrary
bad
as
they
are
the
general
conditions
of
labor
are
better
in
chicago
than
in
most
other
large
cities
and
the
power
of
the
unions
is
more
developed
there
than
in
any
other
american
city
except
san
francisco
so
if
we
are
to
conclude
anything
for
the
influence
of
the
haymarket
bomb
keep
these
facts
in
mind
personally
i
do
not
think
its
influence
on
the
labor
movement
as
such
was
so
very
great
it
will
be
the
same
with
the
present
furore
about
violence
nothing
fundamental
has
been
altered
two
men
have
been
imprisoned
for
what
they
did
years
ago
they
were
hanged
for
what
they
did
not
do
some
few
more
may
yet
be
imprisoned
but
the
forces
of
life
will
continue
to
revolt
against
their
economic
chains
there
will
be
no
cessation
in
that
revolt
no
matter
what
ticket
men
vote
or
fail
to
vote
until
the
chains
are
broken
how
will
the
chains
be
broken
political
actionists
tell
us
it
will
be
only
by
means
of
party
action
at
the
polls
by
voting
themselves
into
possession
of
the
sources
of
life
and
the
tools
by
voting
that
those
who
now
command
forests
mines
ranches
waterways
mills
and
factories
and
likewise
command
the
military
power
to
defend
them
shall
hand
over
their
dominion
to
the
people
and
meanwhile
meanwhile
be
peaceable
industrious
patient
and
frugal
as
madero
told
the
mexican
peons
to
be
after
he
had
sold
them
to
wall
street
even
if
some
of
you
are
disfranchised
do
rise
up
even
against
that
for
it
might
set
back
the
party
well
i
have
already
stated
that
some
good
is
occasionally
accomplished
by
political
action
not
necessarily
party
action
either
but
i
am
abundantly
convinced
that
the
occasional
good
accomplished
is
more
than
counterbalanced
by
the
evil
just
as
i
am
convinced
that
though
there
are
occasional
evils
resulting
from
direct
action
they
are
more
than
counterbalanced
by
the
good
nearly
all
the
laws
which
were
originally
framed
with
the
intention
of
benefiting
the
workers
have
either
turned
into
weapons
in
their
enemies
hands
or
become
dead
letters
unless
the
workers
through
their
organizations
have
directly
enforced
the
observance
so
that
in
the
end
it
is
direct
action
that
has
to
be
relied
on
anyway
as
an
example
of
getting
the
tarred
end
of
a
law
glance
at
the
law
which
was
supposed
to
benefit
the
people
in
general
and
the
working
class
in
particular
about
two
weeks
since
some
union
leaders
were
cited
to
answer
to
the
charge
of
being
trust
formers
as
the
answer
of
the
illinois
central
to
its
strikers
but
the
evil
of
pinning
faith
to
indirect
action
is
far
greater
than
any
such
minor
results
the
main
evil
is
that
it
destroys
initiative
quenches
the
individual
rebellious
spirit
teaches
people
to
rely
on
some
one
else
to
do
for
them
what
they
should
do
for
themselves
what
they
alone
can
do
for
themselves
finally
renders
organic
the
anomalous
idea
that
by
massing
supineness
together
until
a
majority
is
acquired
then
through
the
peculiar
magic
of
that
majority
this
supineness
is
to
be
transformed
into
energy
that
is
people
who
have
lost
the
habit
of
striking
for
themselves
as
individuals
who
have
submitted
to
every
injustice
while
waiting
for
the
majority
to
grow
are
going
to
become
metamorphosed
into
human
by
a
mere
process
of
packing
i
quite
agree
that
the
sources
of
life
and
all
the
natural
wealth
of
the
earth
and
the
tools
necessary
to
production
must
become
free
of
access
to
all
it
is
a
positive
certainty
to
me
that
unionism
must
widen
and
deepen
its
purposes
or
it
will
go
under
and
i
feel
sure
that
the
logic
of
the
situation
will
force
them
to
see
it
gradually
they
must
learn
that
the
workers
problem
can
never
be
solved
by
beating
up
scabs
so
long
as
their
own
policy
of
limiting
their
membership
by
high
initiation
fees
and
other
restrictions
helps
to
make
scabs
they
must
learn
that
the
course
of
growth
is
not
so
much
along
the
line
of
higher
wages
but
shorter
hours
which
will
enable
them
to
increase
membership
to
take
in
everybody
who
is
willing
to
come
into
the
union
they
must
learn
that
if
they
want
to
win
battles
all
allied
workers
must
act
together
act
quickly
serving
no
notice
on
bosses
and
retain
their
freedom
so
to
do
at
all
times
and
finally
they
must
learn
that
even
then
when
they
have
a
complete
organization
they
can
win
nothing
permanent
unless
they
strike
for
everything
not
for
a
wage
not
for
a
minor
improvement
but
for
the
whole
natural
wealth
of
the
earth
and
proceed
to
the
direct
expropriation
of
it
all
they
must
learn
that
their
power
does
not
lie
in
their
voting
strength
that
their
power
lies
in
their
ability
to
stop
production
it
is
a
great
mistake
to
suppose
that
the
constitute
a
majority
of
the
voters
are
here
and
there
and
that
hinders
a
large
number
from
voting
a
great
percentage
of
them
in
this
country
are
foreigners
without
a
voting
right
the
most
patent
proof
that
socialist
leaders
know
this
is
so
is
that
they
are
compromising
their
propaganda
at
every
point
to
win
the
support
of
the
business
class
the
small
investor
their
campaign
papers
proclaimed
that
their
interviewers
had
been
assured
by
wall
street
bond
purchasers
that
they
would
be
just
as
ready
to
buy
los
angeles
bonds
from
a
socialist
as
a
capitalist
administration
that
the
present
milwaukee
administration
has
been
a
boon
to
the
small
investor
their
reading
notices
assure
their
readers
in
this
city
that
we
need
not
go
to
the
great
department
stores
to
buy
buy
rather
of
on
milwaukee
avenue
who
will
satisfy
us
quite
as
well
as
a
big
business
institution
in
short
they
are
making
every
desperate
effort
to
win
the
support
and
to
prolong
the
life
of
that
which
socialistic
economy
says
must
be
ground
to
pieces
because
they
know
they
can
not
get
a
majority
without
them
the
most
that
a
party
could
do
even
if
its
politicians
remained
honest
would
be
to
form
a
strong
faction
in
the
legislatures
which
might
by
combining
its
vote
with
one
side
or
the
other
win
certain
political
or
economic
palliatives
but
what
the
can
do
when
once
they
grow
into
a
solidified
organization
is
to
show
the
possessing
classes
through
a
sudden
cessation
of
all
work
that
the
whole
social
structure
rests
on
them
that
the
possessions
of
the
others
are
absolutely
worthless
to
them
without
the
workers
activity
that
such
protests
such
strikes
are
inherent
in
the
system
of
property
and
will
continually
recur
until
the
whole
thing
is
abolished
and
having
shown
that
effectively
proceed
to
expropriate
but
the
military
power
says
the
political
actionist
we
must
get
political
power
or
the
military
will
be
used
against
us
against
a
real
general
strike
the
military
can
do
nothing
oh
true
if
you
have
a
socialist
briand
in
power
he
may
declare
the
workers
public
officials
and
try
to
make
them
serve
against
themselves
but
against
the
solid
wall
of
an
immobile
even
a
briand
would
be
broken
meanwhile
until
this
international
awakening
the
war
will
go
on
as
it
has
been
going
in
spite
of
all
the
hysteria
which
people
who
do
not
understand
life
and
its
necessities
may
manifest
in
spite
of
all
the
shivering
that
timid
leaders
have
done
in
spite
of
all
the
reactionary
revenges
that
may
be
taken
in
spite
of
all
the
capital
politicians
make
out
of
the
situation
it
will
go
on
because
life
cries
to
live
and
property
denies
its
freedom
to
live
and
life
will
not
submit
and
should
not
submit
it
will
go
on
until
that
day
when
a
humanity
is
able
to
chant
swinburne
hymn
of
man
glory
to
man
in
the
highest
for
man
is
the
master
of
things
the
paris
commune
the
paris
commune
like
other
spectacular
events
in
human
history
has
become
the
clinging
point
for
many
legends
alike
among
its
enemies
and
among
its
friends
indeed
one
must
often
question
which
was
the
real
commune
the
legend
or
the
fact
what
was
actually
lived
or
the
conception
of
it
which
has
shaped
itself
in
the
during
those
forty
odd
years
that
have
gone
since
the
of
march
it
is
thus
with
doctrines
it
is
thus
with
personalities
it
is
thus
with
events
which
is
the
real
christianity
the
simple
doctrine
attributed
to
christ
or
the
practical
preaching
and
realizing
of
organized
christianity
which
is
the
real
abraham
lincoln
the
clever
politician
who
emancipated
the
chattel
slaves
as
an
act
of
policy
or
the
legendary
apostle
of
human
liberty
who
rises
like
a
gigantic
figure
of
iconoclastic
right
smiting
old
wrongs
and
receiving
the
martyr
crown
therefor
which
is
the
real
commune
the
thing
that
was
or
the
thing
our
orators
have
painted
it
which
will
be
the
influencing
power
in
the
days
that
are
to
come
our
commune
commemorators
are
wont
to
say
and
surely
they
believe
that
the
declaration
of
the
commune
was
the
spontaneous
assertion
of
independence
by
the
parisian
masses
consciously
alive
to
the
fact
that
the
national
government
of
france
had
treated
them
most
outrageously
in
the
matter
of
defense
against
the
prussian
army
they
believe
that
the
farce
of
the
situation
in
which
the
city
found
itself
had
opened
the
eyes
of
the
general
populace
to
the
fact
that
the
national
government
so
far
from
serving
the
supposed
prime
purpose
of
government
as
a
means
of
defense
against
a
foreign
invader
was
in
reality
a
thing
so
apart
from
them
and
their
interests
that
it
preferred
to
leave
them
to
the
mercy
of
the
prussians
to
endangering
its
own
supremacy
by
assisting
in
their
defense
or
permitting
them
to
defend
themselves
it
is
a
pity
that
this
legendary
figure
of
awakened
paris
is
not
a
true
one
the
commune
in
fact
was
not
the
work
of
the
whole
people
of
paris
nor
of
a
majority
of
the
people
of
paris
the
commune
was
really
established
by
a
comparatively
small
number
of
able
nay
brilliant
and
supremely
devoted
men
and
women
from
walk
in
life
but
with
a
relatively
high
percentage
of
military
men
engineers
and
political
journalists
some
of
whom
had
time
and
again
been
in
prison
before
for
seditious
writing
or
acts
of
rebellion
they
flocked
in
from
their
exile
in
the
neighboring
countries
thinking
that
now
they
saw
the
opportunity
for
retrieving
former
errors
and
arousing
the
people
to
renew
and
to
extend
the
struggle
of
it
is
true
that
there
were
also
teachers
artists
designers
architects
and
builders
skilled
craftsmen
of
every
sort
and
perhaps
no
chapter
in
the
whole
story
is
more
inspiring
than
the
description
of
the
gatherings
of
the
workers
which
took
place
night
after
night
in
every
quarter
of
the
beleaguered
city
previous
to
the
of
march
and
thereafter
to
such
meetings
went
those
who
burned
with
fervor
of
faith
in
what
the
people
might
and
would
accomplish
and
with
the
radiant
vision
of
a
new
social
day
shining
in
their
eyes
endeavored
to
make
it
clear
to
those
who
listened
one
almost
catches
the
redolence
of
outbursting
faith
that
rising
of
the
sap
of
hope
and
courage
and
daring
like
an
incense
of
spring
almost
feels
himself
there
partaking
in
the
work
the
danger
the
glorious
mistaken
assurance
which
was
theirs
and
yet
the
truth
must
have
been
that
these
apostles
of
the
commune
were
blinded
by
their
own
enthusiasm
deafened
by
the
enthusiasm
they
evoked
in
others
to
the
fact
that
the
great
unvoiced
majority
who
did
not
attend
public
meetings
who
sat
within
their
houses
or
kept
silent
in
the
shops
were
not
converted
or
affected
by
their
teachings
we
are
told
by
those
who
should
know
the
survivors
among
the
communards
themselves
that
the
actual
number
of
persons
who
were
aggressive
moving
spirits
in
the
great
uprising
was
not
greatly
above
the
mass
of
the
people
were
as
they
would
probably
be
in
this
city
under
like
circumstances
indifferent
as
to
what
went
on
over
their
heads
so
that
the
peace
and
quiet
of
their
individual
lives
was
restored
so
that
the
siege
of
the
prussians
was
raised
and
themselves
permitted
to
go
about
their
business
if
the
commune
could
assure
that
good
luck
to
it
they
were
tired
of
the
siege
and
they
longed
for
their
old
familiar
miseries
to
which
they
were
in
some
respect
accustomed
they
hardly
dreamed
of
anything
better
but
as
is
usually
the
case
when
strategic
moments
arise
these
same
plain
stolid
indifferent
people
who
neither
know
nor
care
about
fine
theories
of
political
right
municipal
sovereignty
and
so
forth
see
more
directly
into
the
logic
of
a
situation
than
those
who
have
confused
their
minds
with
much
theorizing
likewise
the
people
of
paris
in
general
when
the
commune
had
become
an
established
fact
saw
that
the
only
consequent
proceeding
would
be
to
make
war
economically
as
well
as
politically
to
cut
off
any
source
of
supply
to
the
national
army
which
lay
within
the
city
instead
of
doing
that
the
government
of
the
commune
anxious
to
prove
itself
more
than
the
old
regime
stupidly
defended
the
property
right
of
its
enemies
and
continued
to
let
the
bank
of
france
furnish
supplies
to
those
who
were
financing
the
army
of
versailles
the
very
army
which
was
to
cut
their
throats
naturally
the
plain
people
grew
disgusted
with
so
senseless
a
program
and
in
the
main
took
no
part
in
the
final
struggle
with
the
versailles
troops
nor
even
opposed
the
idea
of
their
entrance
into
the
city
probably
a
goodly
number
even
drew
a
sigh
of
relief
at
the
prospect
of
a
return
to
the
smaller
evil
of
the
two
little
enough
did
they
dream
that
the
way
back
lay
through
their
own
blood
and
that
they
who
had
never
lifted
hand
or
voice
for
the
commune
would
become
its
martyrs
little
did
they
conceive
the
wild
revenge
of
law
and
order
upon
rebellion
the
saturnalia
of
restored
power
did
they
sleep
i
wonder
on
the
night
before
the
of
may
when
that
dark
thunder
of
vengeance
was
gathering
to
break
many
slept
well
the
next
night
and
still
sleep
for
then
began
a
murder
grim
and
great
a
murder
whose
painted
image
even
after
these
forty
years
have
risen
and
sunk
upon
it
sends
the
blood
shuddering
backward
and
sets
the
teeth
in
uttermost
horror
and
hate
macmahon
placarded
the
streets
with
peace
and
sent
his
troops
to
make
it
in
the
name
of
that
peace
gallifet
an
incarnation
of
hell
set
his
men
the
example
and
rode
up
and
down
the
streets
of
paris
dashing
out
children
brains
did
a
hand
appear
at
a
shutter
the
window
was
riddled
with
bullets
did
a
cry
of
protest
escape
from
any
throat
the
house
was
invaded
its
inhabitants
driven
out
lined
against
the
walls
and
shot
where
they
stood
the
doctors
and
the
nurses
at
the
bedsides
of
the
wounded
the
very
sick
in
the
hospitals
themselves
were
slaughtered
where
they
lay
such
was
macmahon
peace
after
the
street
massacres
the
organized
massacres
at
the
bastions
the
stakes
of
satory
the
huddled
masses
of
prisoners
the
grim
visitor
with
the
lantern
the
ghastly
call
to
rise
and
follow
the
trenches
dug
by
the
condemned
in
the
slippery
ground
for
their
own
corpses
to
fall
in
thirty
thousand
people
butchered
butchered
by
the
sateless
vengeance
of
authority
and
the
insane
of
the
professional
soldier
butchered
without
a
pretence
of
reason
a
shadow
of
inquiry
merely
as
the
gust
of
insensate
rage
blew
after
the
orgy
of
fury
the
orgy
of
the
inquisition
the
gathering
of
the
prisoners
in
cellar
holes
where
they
must
squat
or
lie
upon
damp
earth
and
see
the
light
daily
only
for
some
short
half
hour
when
an
unexpellable
sun
ray
shot
through
some
unstopped
crevice
the
shifting
of
them
day
and
night
across
the
country
sometimes
in
stock
yard
wagons
stifled
starved
and
jammed
together
as
even
our
butchering
civilization
is
ashamed
to
jam
pigs
for
the
slaughter
sometimes
by
dreadful
marches
mostly
by
night
often
with
the
rain
beating
on
them
the
butts
of
the
soldiers
muskets
striking
them
as
they
lagged
through
weakness
or
through
lameness
then
the
detention
prisons
with
their
agonies
of
hunger
cold
vermin
and
disease
and
the
darkness
of
waiting
death
follow
the
tortures
of
friends
and
relatives
of
communards
or
suspected
communards
to
make
them
betray
the
whereabouts
of
their
friends
could
they
who
had
seen
these
things
forgive
and
forget
they
who
had
seen
ten
year
old
children
lashed
to
make
them
tell
where
their
fathers
were
women
driven
mad
before
the
terrible
choice
of
giving
up
their
sons
who
had
fought
or
their
daughters
who
had
not
to
the
brutality
of
the
soldiery
after
the
tortures
of
the
hunt
the
tortures
of
the
trials
solemn
farces
cruelties
then
the
long
hopeless
line
of
exiles
marching
from
the
prison
to
the
port
crowded
on
the
transport
ships
watched
like
caged
animals
forbidden
to
speak
the
cannon
always
threatening
above
them
and
so
drifted
away
away
to
exile
lands
to
barren
islands
and
fever
shores
there
to
waste
away
in
loneliness
in
uselessness
in
futile
dreams
of
freedom
that
ended
in
chains
upon
the
ankles
or
death
on
the
coral
reefs
all
this
was
the
mercy
and
the
wisdom
shown
by
the
national
government
to
the
rebel
city
whose
works
are
the
glory
of
france
and
whose
beauty
is
the
beauty
of
the
world
whatever
other
lesson
we
have
to
learn
this
one
is
certain
the
glutless
revenge
of
restored
authority
if
ever
one
rebels
let
him
rebel
to
the
end
there
is
no
hope
so
futile
as
hope
in
either
the
justice
or
the
mercy
of
a
power
against
which
a
rebellion
has
been
raised
no
faith
so
simple
or
so
foolish
as
faith
in
the
discrimination
the
judgement
or
the
wisdom
of
a
reconquering
government
whether
at
that
time
the
essential
principle
of
the
independent
commune
could
have
been
realized
or
not
through
a
general
response
of
the
other
cities
of
france
by
like
action
in
case
paris
had
continued
to
maintain
the
struggle
some
months
longer
i
am
not
historian
enough
nor
historic
prophet
enough
to
say
i
incline
to
think
not
but
certainly
the
struggle
would
have
been
far
other
far
more
fruitful
in
its
results
both
then
and
later
even
if
finally
overthrown
had
it
really
been
a
movement
of
all
those
people
who
were
so
indiscriminately
murdered
for
it
so
vilely
tortured
so
mercilessly
exiled
for
had
it
really
been
the
deliberate
expression
of
a
million
people
will
to
be
free
they
would
have
seized
whatever
supplies
were
being
furnished
the
enemy
from
within
their
own
gates
they
would
have
repudiated
property
rights
created
by
the
very
power
they
were
seeking
to
overthrow
they
would
have
seen
what
was
necessary
and
done
it
had
the
real
communards
themselves
seen
the
logic
of
their
own
effort
and
understood
that
to
overset
the
political
system
of
dependence
which
enslaves
the
communes
they
must
overset
the
economic
institutions
which
beget
the
centralized
state
had
they
proclaimed
a
general
communalization
of
the
city
resources
they
might
have
won
the
people
to
full
faith
in
the
struggle
and
aroused
a
effort
to
win
out
if
that
again
had
been
followed
by
a
like
contagion
in
the
other
cities
of
france
which
was
a
possibility
the
flame
might
have
caught
throughout
latin
europe
and
those
countries
might
now
be
giving
a
practical
example
of
the
extension
of
a
modified
socialism
and
local
autonomy
this
is
what
is
likely
to
happen
at
the
next
similar
outbreak
if
politicians
are
so
impolitic
as
to
provoke
the
like
there
are
those
among
the
best
social
students
who
feel
sure
that
such
will
be
the
course
of
progress
i
frankly
say
that
i
can
not
see
the
path
of
future
progress
my
vision
is
not
large
enough
nor
my
viewpoint
high
enough
where
others
perhaps
behold
the
morning
sunlight
i
can
discern
only
mists
blowing
dust
and
moving
glooms
which
obscure
the
future
i
do
not
know
where
the
path
leads
nor
how
it
goes
only
when
looking
backward
i
can
catch
glimpses
of
that
long
terrible
toilsome
way
by
which
humanity
has
gone
forward
even
that
i
do
not
see
clearly
just
stretches
of
it
here
and
there
but
i
see
enough
of
it
to
know
that
never
has
it
been
a
straight
undeviating
line
always
the
path
winds
and
returns
and
even
in
the
moment
of
gaining
something
there
is
something
lost
against
the
onslaught
of
nature
man
collects
his
social
strength
and
loses
thereby
the
freedom
of
his
more
isolated
condition
against
the
inconveniences
of
primitive
society
he
hurls
his
inventive
genius
compasses
land
sea
and
air
and
by
the
very
act
of
conquering
his
limitations
binds
fresh
fetters
on
himself
creating
a
wealth
which
he
enslaves
himself
to
produce
and
this
is
the
path
of
progress
which
there
was
no
foreseeing
what
waits
them
and
what
hope
is
there
and
what
help
is
there
what
waits
the
unknown
waits
as
it
has
always
waited
dark
vague
immense
impenetrable
the
mystery
which
allures
the
young
and
strong
saying
come
and
cope
with
me
the
mystery
from
which
the
old
and
wise
shrink
back
saying
better
to
endure
the
evils
that
we
have
than
fly
to
others
that
we
know
not
of
the
old
and
wise
but
alas
the
the
mystery
of
the
still
unbound
strengths
of
earth
sun
and
depths
the
loosing
of
any
one
of
which
may
so
alter
the
face
of
all
that
has
been
done
that
what
now
we
think
a
guarantee
of
liberty
may
become
the
very
chain
of
slavery
as
has
been
the
case
before
with
freedoms
laboriously
won
by
act
and
then
set
down
in
words
for
unborn
men
to
abide
by
and
yet
it
waits
are
you
strong
and
courageous
the
unknown
invites
you
to
the
struggle
dares
you
to
its
conquering
nay
it
is
perhaps
your
future
beloved
waiting
to
reward
your
daring
passion
with
the
fervors
of
fresh
creation
are
you
feeble
and
timid
of
spirit
bow
your
head
to
the
ground
still
you
must
meet
the
future
still
you
must
go
in
the
track
of
the
others
you
may
hinder
them
you
may
make
them
lag
you
can
not
stop
them
nor
yourself
struggle
waits
abortive
struggle
crushed
struggle
mistaken
struggle
long
and
often
and
worse
than
all
this
the
long
of
inaction
when
no
one
does
anything
when
even
the
daring
can
only
move
in
circles
when
no
one
knows
what
to
do
except
to
endure
the
pressure
of
intolerable
conditions
how
to
better
which
he
knows
not
when
living
appears
a
monotonous
journey
through
a
featureless
wilderness
wherein
the
same
pitiless
word
useless
stares
at
one
from
every
aimless
path
one
seeks
to
follow
in
the
despairing
search
for
a
way
out
and
happier
is
he
who
perishes
in
the
mistaken
struggle
than
he
who
with
a
hot
and
chafing
soul
but
with
clear
discernment
sees
that
he
is
doomed
to
go
on
indefinitely
in
submission
to
the
wrongs
that
are
what
hope
is
there
that
the
increasing
pressure
of
conditions
may
quicken
intelligences
that
even
out
of
mistaken
struggle
frustrate
struggle
unforeseen
good
consequences
may
flow
just
as
out
of
undeniable
improvements
in
material
life
unforeseeable
ill
results
are
consequent
the
commune
hoped
to
free
paris
and
by
so
setting
an
example
free
many
other
cities
it
went
down
in
utter
defeat
and
no
city
was
freed
thereby
but
out
of
this
defeat
the
knowledge
and
skill
of
craftsmanship
of
its
people
went
abroad
over
other
lands
both
into
civilized
centers
and
to
wild
waste
places
and
wherever
its
art
went
its
idea
went
also
so
that
the
commune
the
idealized
commune
has
become
a
watchword
through
the
workshops
of
the
world
wherever
there
are
even
a
few
workers
seeking
to
awaken
their
fellows
there
are
those
who
have
definite
hopes
those
who
think
they
know
precisely
how
overwork
and
underwork
and
poverty
and
all
their
consequences
of
spiritual
enslavement
are
to
be
abolished
such
are
they
who
think
they
can
see
the
way
of
progress
broad
and
clear
through
the
slit
in
a
ballot
box
i
fear
their
works
will
have
some
uncalculated
consequences
also
if
ever
they
execute
them
i
fear
their
narrowly
enclosed
view
deceives
them
much
climbing
a
hill
is
a
different
affair
from
voting
oneself
at
the
top
no
matter
man
always
hopes
life
always
hopes
when
a
definite
object
can
not
be
outlined
the
indomitable
spirit
of
hope
still
impels
the
living
mass
to
move
toward
something
something
that
shall
somehow
be
better
what
help
is
there
no
help
from
outside
power
no
help
from
overhead
no
help
from
the
sky
pray
to
it
ever
so
much
no
help
from
the
strong
hand
of
wise
men
nor
of
good
men
however
wise
or
good
such
help
always
ends
in
despotism
nor
yet
is
there
help
in
the
abnegation
of
generous
fanatics
whose
efforts
end
in
deplorable
fiasco
as
did
the
commune
help
lies
only
in
the
general
will
of
those
who
do
the
work
to
say
how
when
and
where
they
shall
do
it
the
force
of
the
lesson
of
the
commune
is
that
people
can
not
be
made
free
who
have
not
conceived
freedom
yet
through
such
examples
they
may
learn
to
conceive
it
it
can
not
be
bestowed
as
a
gift
it
must
be
taken
by
those
who
want
it
let
us
hope
that
those
who
would
have
given
it
bought
that
much
by
their
sacrifice
that
they
touched
the
unseeing
eyes
of
the
somnambulist
proletariat
with
a
light
which
has
made
them
dream
at
least
of
waking
the
mexican
revolution
that
a
nation
of
people
considering
themselves
enlightened
informed
alert
to
the
interests
of
the
hour
should
be
so
generally
and
so
profoundly
ignorant
of
a
revolution
taking
place
in
their
backyard
so
to
speak
as
the
people
of
the
united
states
are
ignorant
of
the
present
revolution
in
mexico
can
be
due
only
to
profoundly
and
generally
acting
causes
that
people
of
revolutionary
principles
and
sympathies
should
be
so
is
inexcusable
it
is
as
one
of
such
principles
and
sympathies
that
i
address
you
as
one
interested
in
every
move
the
people
make
to
throw
off
their
chains
no
matter
where
no
matter
how
though
naturally
my
interest
is
greatest
where
the
move
is
such
as
appears
to
me
to
be
most
in
consonance
with
the
general
course
of
progress
where
the
tyranny
attacked
is
what
appears
to
me
the
most
fundamental
where
the
method
followed
is
to
my
thinking
most
direct
and
unmistakable
and
i
add
that
those
of
you
who
have
such
principles
and
sympathies
are
in
the
logic
of
your
own
being
bound
first
to
inform
yourselves
concerning
so
great
a
matter
as
the
revolt
of
millions
of
people
what
they
are
struggling
for
what
they
are
struggling
against
and
how
the
struggle
stands
from
day
to
day
if
possible
if
not
from
week
to
week
or
month
to
month
as
best
you
can
and
second
to
spread
this
knowledge
among
others
and
endeavor
to
do
what
little
you
can
to
awaken
the
consciousness
and
sympathy
of
others
one
of
the
great
reasons
why
the
mass
of
the
american
people
know
nothing
of
the
revolution
in
mexico
is
that
they
have
altogether
a
wrong
conception
of
what
revolution
means
thus
out
of
a
hundred
persons
to
whom
you
broach
the
subject
will
say
why
i
thought
that
ended
long
ago
that
ended
last
may
and
this
week
the
press
even
the
socialist
reports
a
revolution
in
mexico
it
a
new
revolution
at
all
it
is
the
same
revolution
which
did
not
begin
with
the
armed
rebellion
of
last
may
which
has
been
going
on
steadily
ever
since
then
and
before
then
and
is
bound
to
go
on
for
a
long
time
to
come
if
the
other
nations
keep
their
hands
off
and
the
mexican
people
are
allowed
to
work
out
their
own
destiny
what
is
revolution
and
what
is
revolution
a
revolution
means
some
great
and
subversive
change
in
the
social
institutions
of
a
people
whether
sexual
religious
political
or
economic
the
movement
of
the
reformation
was
a
great
religious
revolution
a
profound
alteration
in
human
thought
a
refashioning
of
the
human
mind
the
general
movement
towards
political
change
in
europe
and
america
about
the
close
of
the
eighteenth
century
was
a
revolution
the
american
and
the
french
revolutions
were
only
prominent
individual
incidents
in
it
culminations
of
the
teachings
of
the
rights
of
man
the
present
unrest
of
the
world
in
its
economic
relations
as
manifested
from
day
to
day
in
the
opposing
combinations
of
men
and
money
in
strikes
and
in
literature
and
movements
of
all
kinds
demanding
a
readjustment
of
the
whole
or
of
parts
of
our
and
system
this
unrest
is
the
revolution
of
our
time
the
economic
which
is
seeking
social
change
and
will
go
on
until
it
is
accomplished
we
are
in
it
at
any
moment
of
our
lives
it
may
invade
our
own
homes
with
its
stern
demand
for
and
suffering
its
more
violent
manifestations
are
in
liverpool
and
london
in
barcelona
and
vienna
in
new
york
and
chicago
the
day
after
humanity
is
a
seething
heaving
mass
of
unease
tumbling
like
surge
over
a
slipping
sliding
shifting
bottom
and
there
will
never
be
any
ease
until
a
rock
bottom
of
economic
justice
is
reached
the
mexican
revolution
is
one
of
the
prominent
manifestations
of
this
economic
revolt
it
possibly
holds
as
important
a
place
in
the
present
disruption
and
reconstruction
of
economic
institutions
as
the
great
revolution
of
france
held
in
the
eighteenth
century
movement
it
did
not
begin
with
the
odious
government
of
diaz
nor
end
with
his
downfall
any
more
than
the
revolution
in
france
began
with
the
coronation
of
louis
xvi
or
ended
with
his
beheading
it
began
in
the
bitter
and
outraged
hearts
of
the
peasants
who
for
generations
have
suffered
under
a
system
of
exploitation
imported
and
foisted
upon
them
by
which
they
have
been
dispossessed
of
their
homes
compelled
to
become
of
those
who
robbed
them
and
under
diaz
in
case
of
rebellion
to
be
deported
to
a
distant
province
a
killing
climate
and
hellish
labor
it
will
end
only
when
that
bitterness
is
assuaged
by
very
great
alteration
in
the
system
or
until
the
people
have
been
absolutely
crushed
into
subjection
by
a
strong
military
power
whether
that
power
be
a
native
or
a
foreign
one
now
the
political
overthrow
of
last
may
which
was
followed
by
the
substitution
of
one
political
manager
for
another
did
not
at
all
touch
the
economic
situation
it
promised
of
course
politicians
always
promise
it
promised
to
consider
measures
for
altering
conditions
in
the
meantime
proprietors
are
assured
that
the
new
government
intends
to
respect
the
rights
of
landlords
and
capitalists
and
exhorts
the
workers
to
be
patient
and
frugal
yes
that
was
the
exhortation
in
madero
paper
to
men
who
when
they
are
able
to
get
work
make
cents
a
day
a
man
owning
acres
of
land
exhorts
the
disinherited
workers
of
mexico
to
be
frugal
the
idea
that
such
a
condition
can
be
dealt
with
by
the
immemorial
remedy
offered
by
tyrants
to
slaves
is
like
the
idea
of
sweeping
out
the
sea
with
a
broom
and
unless
that
frugality
or
in
other
words
starvation
is
forced
upon
the
people
by
more
bayonets
and
more
strategy
than
appear
to
be
at
the
government
command
the
mexican
revolution
will
go
on
to
the
solution
of
mexico
land
question
with
a
rapidity
and
directness
of
purpose
not
witnessed
in
any
previous
upheaval
for
it
must
be
understood
that
the
main
revolt
is
a
revolt
against
the
system
of
land
tenure
the
industrial
revolution
of
the
cities
while
it
is
far
from
being
silent
is
not
to
compare
with
the
agrarian
revolt
let
us
understand
why
mexico
consists
of
states
two
territories
and
a
federal
district
about
the
capital
city
its
population
totals
about
of
these
are
of
unmixed
indian
descent
people
somewhat
similar
in
character
to
the
pueblos
of
our
own
southwestern
states
primitively
agricultural
for
an
immemorial
period
communistic
in
many
of
their
social
customs
and
like
all
indians
invincible
haters
of
authority
these
indians
are
scattered
throughout
the
rural
districts
of
mexico
one
particularly
and
much
talked
of
tribe
the
yaquis
having
had
its
fatherland
in
the
rich
northern
state
of
sonora
a
very
valuable
agricultural
country
the
indian
population
especially
the
yaquis
and
the
moquis
have
always
disputed
the
usurpations
of
the
invaders
government
from
the
days
of
the
early
conquest
until
now
and
will
undoubtedly
continue
to
dispute
them
as
long
as
there
is
an
indian
left
or
until
their
right
to
use
the
soil
out
of
which
they
sprang
paying
tribute
in
any
is
freely
recognized
the
communistic
customs
of
these
people
are
very
interesting
and
very
instructive
too
they
have
gone
on
practising
them
all
these
hundreds
of
years
in
spite
of
the
foreign
civilization
that
was
being
grafted
upon
mexico
grafted
in
all
senses
of
the
word
and
it
was
not
until
forty
years
ago
indeed
the
worst
of
it
not
till
years
ago
that
the
increasing
power
of
the
government
made
it
possible
to
destroy
this
ancient
life
of
the
people
by
them
the
woods
the
waters
and
the
lands
were
held
in
common
any
one
might
cut
wood
from
the
forest
to
build
his
cabin
make
use
of
the
rivers
to
irrigate
his
field
or
garden
patch
and
this
is
a
right
whose
acknowledgment
none
but
those
who
know
the
aridity
of
the
southwest
can
fully
appreciate
the
imperative
necessity
for
tillable
lands
were
allotted
by
mutual
agreement
before
sowing
and
reverted
to
the
tribe
after
harvesting
for
reallotment
pasturage
the
right
to
collect
fuel
were
for
all
the
habits
of
mutual
aid
which
always
arise
among
sparsely
settled
communities
were
instinctive
with
them
neighbor
assisted
neighbor
to
build
his
cabin
to
plough
his
ground
to
gather
and
store
this
crop
no
legal
machinery
existed
no
taxgatherer
no
justice
no
jailer
all
that
they
had
to
do
with
the
hated
foreign
civilization
was
to
pay
the
periodical
and
to
get
out
of
the
way
of
the
recruiting
officer
when
he
came
around
those
two
personages
they
regarded
with
spite
and
dread
but
as
the
major
portion
of
their
lives
was
not
in
immediate
contact
with
them
they
could
still
keep
on
in
their
old
way
of
life
in
the
main
with
the
development
of
the
diaz
regime
which
came
into
power
in
and
when
i
say
the
diaz
regime
i
do
not
especially
mean
the
man
diaz
for
i
think
he
has
been
both
overcursed
and
overpraised
but
the
whole
force
which
has
steadily
developed
centralized
power
from
then
on
and
the
whole
policy
of
civilizing
mexico
which
was
the
diaz
boast
with
its
development
i
say
this
indian
life
has
been
broken
up
violated
with
as
ruthless
a
hand
as
ever
tore
up
a
people
by
the
roots
and
cast
them
out
as
weeds
to
wither
in
the
sun
historians
relate
with
horror
the
iron
deeds
of
william
the
conqueror
who
in
the
eleventh
century
created
the
new
forest
by
laying
waste
the
farms
of
england
destroying
the
homes
of
the
people
to
make
room
for
the
deer
but
his
edicts
were
mercy
compared
with
the
action
of
the
mexican
government
toward
the
indians
in
order
to
introduce
progressive
civilization
the
diaz
regime
granted
away
immense
concessions
of
land
to
native
and
foreign
capitalists
chiefly
foreign
indeed
though
there
were
enough
of
native
sharks
as
well
mostly
these
concessions
were
granted
to
capitalistic
combinations
which
were
to
build
railroads
and
in
some
cases
did
so
in
a
most
uncalled
for
and
uneconomic
way
develop
mineral
resources
or
establish
modern
industries
the
government
took
no
note
of
the
ancient
tribal
rights
or
customs
and
those
who
received
the
concessions
proceeded
to
enforce
their
property
rights
they
introduced
the
unheard
of
crime
of
trespass
they
forbade
the
cutting
of
a
tree
the
breaking
of
a
branch
the
gathering
of
the
fallen
wood
in
the
forests
they
claimed
the
watercourses
forbidding
their
free
use
to
the
people
and
it
was
as
if
one
had
forbidden
to
us
the
rains
of
heaven
the
unoccupied
land
was
theirs
no
hand
might
drive
a
plow
into
the
soil
without
first
obtaining
permission
from
a
distant
master
a
permission
granted
on
the
condition
that
the
product
be
the
landlord
a
small
pitifully
small
wage
the
worker
nor
was
this
enough
in
was
passed
the
law
of
unappropriated
lands
by
that
law
not
only
were
the
great
stretches
of
in
the
old
time
land
appropriated
but
the
occupied
lands
themselves
to
the
occupants
could
not
show
a
legal
were
to
be
denounced
that
is
the
educated
and
the
powerful
who
were
able
to
keep
up
with
the
doings
of
the
government
went
to
the
courts
and
said
that
there
was
no
legal
title
to
such
and
such
land
and
put
in
a
claim
for
it
and
the
usual
of
legality
being
complied
with
the
actual
occupant
of
the
land
being
all
the
time
blissfully
unconscious
of
the
law
in
the
innocence
of
his
barbarism
supposing
that
the
working
of
the
ground
by
his
generations
of
forbears
was
title
one
fine
day
the
sheriff
comes
upon
this
hapless
dweller
on
the
heath
and
drives
him
from
his
ancient
habitat
to
wander
an
outcast
such
are
the
blessings
of
education
mankind
invents
a
written
sign
to
aid
its
intercommunication
and
forthwith
all
manner
of
miracles
are
wrought
with
the
sign
even
such
a
miracle
as
that
a
part
of
the
solid
earth
passes
under
the
mastery
of
an
impotent
sheet
of
paper
and
a
distant
bit
of
animated
flesh
which
never
even
saw
the
ground
acquires
the
power
to
expel
hundreds
thousands
of
like
bits
of
flesh
though
they
grew
upon
that
ground
as
the
trees
grow
labored
it
with
their
hands
and
fertilized
it
with
their
bones
for
a
thousand
years
this
law
of
unappropriated
lands
says
william
archer
has
covered
the
country
with
naboth
vineyards
i
think
it
would
require
a
biblical
prophet
to
describe
the
abomination
of
desolation
it
has
made
it
was
to
become
lords
of
this
desolation
that
the
men
who
play
the
game
landlords
who
are
at
the
same
time
governors
and
magistrates
enterprising
capitalists
seeking
investments
connived
at
the
iniquities
of
the
diaz
regime
i
will
go
further
and
say
devised
them
the
madero
family
alone
owns
some
square
miles
of
territory
more
than
the
entire
state
of
new
jersey
the
terrazas
family
in
the
state
of
chihuahua
owns
square
miles
rather
more
than
the
entire
state
of
west
virginia
nearly
the
size
of
illinois
what
was
the
plantation
owning
of
our
southern
states
in
chattel
slavery
days
compared
with
this
and
the
peon
share
for
his
toil
upon
these
great
estates
is
hardly
more
than
was
the
chattel
slave
wretched
housing
wretched
food
and
wretched
clothing
it
is
to
slaves
like
these
that
madero
appeals
to
be
frugal
it
is
of
men
who
have
thus
been
disinherited
that
our
complacent
of
origin
say
mexicans
what
do
you
know
about
mexicans
their
whole
idea
of
life
is
to
lean
up
against
a
fence
and
smoke
cigarettes
and
pray
what
idea
of
life
should
a
people
have
whose
means
of
life
in
their
own
way
have
been
taken
from
them
should
they
be
so
mighty
anxious
to
convert
their
strength
into
wealth
for
some
other
man
to
loll
in
it
reminds
me
very
much
of
the
answer
given
by
a
negro
employee
on
the
works
at
fortress
monroe
to
a
companion
of
mine
who
questioned
him
on
his
easy
idleness
when
the
foreman
back
was
turned
ah
ai
goin
to
do
no
white
man
work
fo
ah
don
get
no
white
man
pay
but
for
the
yaquis
there
was
worse
than
this
not
only
were
their
lands
seized
but
they
were
ordered
a
few
years
since
to
be
deported
to
yucatan
now
sonora
as
i
said
is
a
northern
state
and
yucatan
one
of
the
southernmost
yucatan
hemp
is
famous
and
so
is
yucatan
fever
and
yucatan
slavery
on
the
hemp
plantations
it
was
to
that
fever
and
that
slavery
that
the
yaquis
were
deported
in
droves
of
hundreds
at
a
time
men
women
and
children
droves
like
cattle
droves
driven
and
beaten
like
cattle
they
died
there
like
flies
as
it
was
meant
they
should
sonora
was
desolated
of
her
rebellious
people
and
the
land
became
pacific
in
the
hands
of
the
new
landowners
too
pacific
in
spots
they
had
not
left
people
enough
to
reap
the
harvests
then
the
government
suspended
the
deportation
act
but
with
the
provision
that
for
every
crime
committed
by
a
yaqui
five
hundred
of
his
people
be
deported
this
statement
is
made
in
madero
own
book
now
what
in
all
conscience
would
any
one
with
decent
human
feeling
expect
a
yaqui
to
do
fight
as
long
as
there
was
powder
and
bullet
to
be
begged
borrowed
or
stolen
as
long
as
there
is
a
garden
to
plunder
or
a
hole
in
the
hills
to
hide
in
when
the
revolution
burst
out
the
yaquis
and
other
indian
peoples
said
to
the
revolutionists
promise
us
our
lands
back
and
we
will
fight
with
you
and
they
are
keeping
their
word
magnificently
all
during
the
summer
they
have
kept
up
the
warfare
early
in
september
the
chihuahua
papers
reported
a
band
of
yaquis
in
sonora
about
to
attack
el
anil
a
week
later
yaquis
had
seized
the
former
quarters
of
the
federal
troops
at
pitahaya
this
week
it
is
reported
that
federal
troops
are
dispatched
to
ponoitlan
a
town
in
jalisco
to
quell
the
indians
who
have
risen
in
revolt
again
because
their
delusion
that
the
maderist
government
was
to
restore
their
land
has
been
dispelled
like
reports
from
sinaloa
in
the
terrible
state
of
yucatan
the
mayas
are
in
active
rebellion
the
reports
say
that
the
authorities
and
leading
citizens
of
various
towns
have
been
seized
by
the
malcontents
and
put
in
prison
what
is
more
interesting
is
that
the
peons
have
seized
not
only
the
leading
citizens
but
still
more
to
the
purpose
have
seized
the
plantations
parceled
them
and
are
already
gathering
the
crops
for
themselves
of
course
it
is
not
the
pure
indians
alone
who
form
the
peon
class
of
mexico
rather
more
than
double
the
number
of
indians
are
mixed
breeds
that
is
about
leaving
less
than
of
pure
white
stock
the
mestiza
or
mixed
breed
population
have
followed
the
communistic
instincts
and
customs
of
their
indian
forbears
while
from
the
latin
side
of
their
they
have
certain
tendencies
which
work
well
together
with
their
indian
hatred
of
authority
the
mestiza
as
well
as
the
indians
are
mostly
ignorant
in
only
about
sixteen
per
cent
of
the
whole
population
of
mexico
being
able
to
read
and
write
it
was
not
within
the
program
of
the
civilizing
regime
to
spend
money
in
putting
the
weapon
of
learning
in
the
people
hands
but
to
conclude
that
people
are
necessarily
unintelligent
because
they
are
illiterate
is
in
itself
a
rather
unintelligent
proceeding
moreover
a
people
habituated
to
the
communal
customs
of
an
ancient
agricultural
life
do
not
need
books
or
papers
to
tell
them
that
the
soil
is
the
source
of
wealth
and
they
must
get
back
to
the
land
even
if
their
intelligence
is
limited
accordingly
they
have
got
back
to
the
land
in
the
state
of
morelos
which
is
a
small
state
but
a
very
important
one
being
next
to
the
federal
district
and
by
consequence
to
the
city
of
mexico
there
has
been
a
remarkable
land
revolution
general
zapata
whose
name
has
figured
elusively
in
newspaper
reports
now
as
having
made
peace
with
madero
then
as
breaking
faith
next
wounded
and
killed
and
again
resurrected
and
in
hiding
then
anew
on
the
warpath
and
proclaimed
by
the
provisional
government
the
who
must
surrender
unconditionally
and
be
tried
by
who
has
seized
the
strategic
points
on
both
the
railroads
running
through
morelos
and
who
just
a
few
days
ago
broke
into
the
federal
district
sacked
a
town
fought
successfully
at
two
or
three
points
with
the
federals
blew
out
two
railroad
bridges
and
so
frightened
the
deputies
in
mexico
city
that
they
are
clamoring
for
all
kinds
of
action
this
zapata
the
fires
of
whose
military
camps
are
springing
up
now
in
guerrero
oaxaca
and
puebla
as
well
is
an
indian
with
a
long
score
to
pay
and
all
an
satisfaction
in
paying
it
he
appears
to
be
a
fighter
of
the
style
of
our
revolutionary
marion
and
sumter
the
country
in
which
he
is
operating
is
mountainous
and
guerilla
bands
are
exceedingly
difficult
of
capture
even
when
they
are
defeated
they
have
usually
succeeded
in
inflicting
more
damage
than
they
have
received
and
they
always
get
away
zapata
has
divided
up
the
great
estates
of
morelos
from
end
to
end
telling
the
peasants
to
take
possession
they
have
done
so
they
are
in
possession
and
have
already
harvested
their
crops
morelos
has
a
population
of
some
in
puebla
reports
in
september
told
us
that
eighty
leading
citizens
had
waited
on
the
governor
to
protest
against
the
taking
possession
of
the
land
by
the
peasantry
the
troops
were
deserting
taking
horses
and
arms
with
them
it
is
they
no
doubt
who
are
now
fighting
with
zapata
in
chihuahua
one
of
the
largest
states
prisons
have
been
thrown
open
and
the
prisoners
recruited
as
rebels
a
great
hacienda
was
attacked
and
the
horses
run
off
whereupon
the
peons
rose
and
joined
the
attacking
party
in
sinaloa
a
rich
northern
state
famous
in
the
southwestern
united
states
some
years
ago
as
the
field
of
a
great
experiment
in
which
hoffman
one
of
the
former
editors
of
chicago
daily
socialist
was
a
leading
spirit
this
week
paper
reports
that
the
former
revolutionary
general
juan
banderas
is
heading
an
insurrection
second
in
importance
only
to
that
led
by
zapata
in
the
southern
border
state
of
chiapas
the
taxes
in
many
places
could
not
be
collected
last
week
news
items
said
that
the
present
government
had
sent
general
paz
there
with
federal
troops
to
remedy
that
state
of
affairs
in
tabasco
the
peons
refused
to
harvest
the
crops
for
their
masters
let
us
hope
they
have
imitated
their
brothers
in
morelos
and
gathered
them
for
themselves
the
maderists
have
announced
that
a
stiff
repressive
campaign
will
be
inaugurated
at
once
if
we
are
to
believe
the
papers
we
are
to
believe
madero
guilty
of
the
imbecility
of
saying
five
days
after
my
inauguration
the
rebellion
will
be
crushed
just
why
the
crushing
has
to
wait
till
five
days
after
the
inauguration
does
not
appear
i
conceive
there
must
have
been
some
snickering
among
the
reactionary
deputies
if
such
an
announcement
was
really
made
and
some
astonished
query
among
his
followers
what
are
we
to
conclude
from
all
these
reports
that
the
mexican
people
are
satisfied
that
it
all
good
and
settled
what
should
we
think
if
we
read
that
the
people
not
of
lower
but
of
upper
california
had
turned
out
the
ranch
owners
had
started
to
gather
in
the
field
products
for
themselves
and
that
the
secretary
of
war
had
sent
united
states
troops
to
attack
some
thousands
of
armed
men
zapata
has
had
under
arms
the
whole
summer
and
that
force
is
now
greatly
increased
who
were
defending
that
expropriation
if
we
read
that
in
the
state
of
illinois
the
farmers
had
driven
off
the
tax
collector
that
the
coast
states
were
talking
of
secession
and
forming
an
independent
combination
that
in
pennsylvania
a
division
of
the
federal
army
was
to
be
dispatched
to
overpower
a
rebel
force
of
fifteen
hundred
armed
men
doing
guerilla
work
from
the
mountains
that
the
prison
doors
of
maryland
within
hailing
distance
of
washington
city
were
being
thrown
open
by
armed
revoltees
should
we
call
it
a
condition
of
peace
regard
it
a
proof
that
the
people
were
appeased
we
would
not
we
would
say
that
revolution
was
in
full
swing
and
the
reason
you
have
thought
it
was
all
over
in
mexico
from
last
may
till
now
is
that
the
chicago
press
like
the
eastern
northern
and
central
press
in
general
has
said
nothing
about
this
steady
march
of
revolt
even
has
been
silent
now
that
the
flame
has
shot
up
more
spectacularly
for
the
moment
they
call
it
a
new
revolution
that
the
papers
pursue
this
course
is
partly
due
to
the
generally
acting
causes
that
produce
our
northern
indifference
which
i
shall
presently
try
to
explain
and
partly
to
the
settled
policy
of
capitalized
interest
in
controlling
its
mouthpieces
in
such
a
manner
as
to
give
their
present
henchmen
the
maderists
a
chance
to
pull
their
chestnuts
out
of
the
fire
they
invested
some
in
this
bunch
in
the
hope
that
they
may
be
able
to
accomplish
the
double
feat
of
keeping
capitalist
possessions
intact
and
at
the
same
time
pacifying
the
people
with
specious
promises
they
want
to
lend
them
all
the
countenance
they
can
till
the
experiment
is
well
tried
so
they
deliberately
suppress
revolutionary
news
among
the
later
items
of
interest
reported
by
the
angeles
are
those
which
announce
an
influx
of
and
landlords
of
mexico
who
are
hereafter
to
be
residents
of
los
angeles
what
is
the
meaning
of
it
simply
that
life
in
mexico
is
not
such
a
safe
and
comfortable
proposition
as
it
was
and
that
for
the
present
they
prefer
to
get
such
income
as
their
agents
can
collect
without
themselves
running
the
risk
of
actual
residence
of
course
it
is
understood
that
some
of
this
notable
efflux
the
supporters
of
reyes
for
example
who
have
their
own
little
rebellions
in
tabasco
and
san
luis
potosi
this
week
are
political
reactionists
scheming
to
get
back
the
political
loaves
and
fishes
into
their
own
hands
but
most
are
simply
those
who
know
that
their
property
right
is
safe
enough
to
be
respected
by
the
maderist
government
but
that
the
said
government
is
not
strong
enough
to
put
down
the
innumerable
manifestations
of
popular
hatred
which
are
likely
to
terminate
fatally
to
themselves
if
they
remain
there
nor
is
all
of
this
fighting
revolutionary
not
by
any
means
some
is
reactionary
some
probably
the
satisfaction
of
personal
grudge
much
no
doubt
the
expression
of
general
turbulency
of
a
very
unconscious
nature
but
granting
all
that
may
be
thrown
in
the
balance
the
main
thing
the
mighty
thing
the
regenerative
revolution
is
the
of
the
land
by
the
thousands
upon
thousands
of
them
are
doing
it
ignorant
peasants
peasants
who
know
nothing
about
the
jargon
of
land
reformers
or
of
socialists
yes
that
just
the
glory
of
it
just
the
fact
that
it
is
done
by
ignorant
people
that
is
people
ignorant
of
book
theories
but
ignorant
not
so
ignorant
by
half
of
life
on
the
land
as
the
of
the
cities
their
minds
are
simple
and
direct
they
act
accordingly
for
them
there
is
to
get
back
to
the
land
to
ignore
the
machinery
of
paper
in
many
instances
they
have
burned
the
records
of
the
and
proceed
to
plough
the
ground
to
sow
and
plant
and
gather
and
the
product
economists
of
course
will
say
that
these
ignorant
people
with
their
primitive
institutions
and
methods
will
not
develop
the
agricultural
resources
of
mexico
and
that
they
must
give
way
before
those
who
will
so
develop
its
resources
that
such
is
the
law
of
human
development
in
the
first
place
the
abominable
political
combination
which
gave
away
as
recklessly
as
a
handful
of
the
agricultural
resources
of
mexico
gave
them
away
to
the
millionaire
speculators
who
were
to
the
were
the
educated
men
of
mexico
and
this
is
what
they
saw
fit
to
do
with
their
higher
intelligence
and
education
so
the
ignorant
may
well
distrust
the
good
intentions
of
educated
men
who
talk
about
improvements
in
land
development
in
the
second
place
capitalistic
so
far
from
developing
the
land
in
such
a
manner
as
to
support
a
denser
population
has
depopulated
whole
districts
immense
districts
in
the
third
place
what
the
economists
do
not
say
is
that
the
only
justification
for
intense
cultivation
of
the
land
is
that
the
product
of
such
cultivation
may
build
up
the
bodies
of
men
by
consequence
their
souls
to
richer
and
fuller
manhood
it
is
not
merely
to
pile
up
figures
of
so
many
million
bushels
of
wheat
and
corn
produced
in
a
season
but
that
this
wheat
and
corn
shall
first
go
into
the
stomachs
of
those
who
planted
it
and
in
abundance
to
build
up
the
brawn
and
sinew
of
the
arms
that
work
the
ground
not
meanly
maintaining
them
in
a
condition
and
second
to
build
up
the
strength
of
the
rest
of
the
nation
who
are
willing
to
give
needed
labor
in
exchange
but
never
to
increase
the
fortunes
of
idlers
who
dissipate
it
this
is
the
purpose
and
the
only
purpose
of
tilling
soil
and
the
working
of
it
for
any
other
purpose
is
waste
both
of
land
and
of
men
in
the
fourth
place
no
change
ever
was
or
ever
can
be
worked
out
in
any
society
except
by
the
mass
of
the
people
theories
may
be
propounded
by
educated
people
and
set
down
in
books
and
discussed
in
libraries
and
but
they
will
remain
barren
unless
the
people
in
mass
work
them
out
if
the
change
proposed
is
such
that
it
is
not
adaptable
to
the
minds
of
the
people
for
whose
ills
it
is
supposed
to
be
a
remedy
then
it
will
remain
what
it
was
a
barren
theory
now
the
conditions
in
mexico
have
been
and
are
so
desperate
that
some
change
is
imperative
the
action
of
the
peasants
proves
it
even
if
a
strong
military
dictator
shall
arise
he
will
have
to
allow
some
provision
going
towards
peasant
proprietorship
these
unlettered
but
determined
people
must
be
dealt
with
there
is
no
such
thing
as
waiting
till
they
are
educated
up
to
it
therefore
the
wisdom
of
the
economists
is
wisdom
out
of
place
rather
the
people
never
be
educated
if
their
conditions
are
to
remain
what
they
were
under
the
diaz
regime
bodies
and
minds
are
both
too
impoverished
to
be
able
to
profit
by
a
spread
of
theoretical
education
even
if
it
did
not
require
unavailable
money
and
indefinite
time
to
prepare
such
a
spread
whatever
economic
change
is
wrought
then
must
be
such
as
the
people
in
their
present
state
of
comprehension
can
understand
and
make
use
of
and
we
see
by
the
reports
what
they
understand
they
understand
they
have
a
right
upon
the
soil
a
right
to
use
it
for
themselves
a
right
to
drive
off
the
invader
who
has
robbed
them
to
destroy
landmarks
and
to
ignore
the
taxgatherer
and
his
demands
and
however
primitive
their
agricultural
methods
may
be
one
thing
is
sure
that
they
are
more
economical
than
any
system
which
heaps
up
fortunes
by
destroying
men
moreover
who
is
to
say
how
they
may
develop
their
methods
once
they
have
a
free
opportunity
to
do
so
it
is
a
common
belief
of
the
that
the
indian
is
essentially
lazy
the
reasons
for
his
thinking
so
are
two
under
the
various
tyrannies
and
robberies
which
white
men
in
general
and
in
particular
they
have
even
gone
beyond
the
spaniard
have
inflicted
upon
indians
there
is
no
possible
reason
why
an
indian
should
want
to
work
save
the
idiotic
one
that
work
in
itself
is
a
virtuous
and
exalted
thing
even
if
by
it
the
worker
increases
the
power
of
his
tyrant
as
william
archer
says
if
there
are
men
this
is
not
who
work
for
no
wage
and
with
no
prospect
or
hope
of
any
reward
it
would
be
curious
to
know
by
what
motive
other
than
the
lash
or
the
fear
of
the
lash
they
are
induced
to
go
forth
to
their
labor
in
the
morning
the
second
reason
is
that
an
indian
really
has
a
different
idea
of
what
he
is
alive
for
than
an
has
and
so
have
the
latin
peoples
this
different
idea
is
what
i
meant
when
i
said
that
the
mestiza
have
certain
tendencies
inherited
from
the
latin
side
of
their
which
work
well
together
with
their
indian
hatred
of
authority
the
indian
likes
to
to
be
his
own
master
to
work
when
he
pleases
and
stop
when
he
pleases
he
does
not
crave
many
things
but
he
craves
the
enjoyment
of
the
things
that
he
has
he
feels
himself
more
a
part
of
nature
than
a
white
man
does
all
his
legends
are
of
wanderings
with
nature
of
forests
fields
streams
plants
animals
he
wants
to
live
with
the
same
liberty
as
the
other
children
of
earth
his
philosophy
of
work
is
work
so
as
to
live
this
is
not
laziness
this
is
sense
to
the
person
who
has
that
sort
of
your
latin
on
the
other
hand
also
wants
to
live
and
having
artistic
impulses
in
him
his
idea
of
living
is
very
much
in
gratifying
them
he
likes
music
and
song
and
dance
carving
and
decorating
he
does
like
to
be
forced
to
create
his
fancies
in
a
hurry
he
likes
to
fashion
them
and
admire
them
and
improve
and
refashion
them
and
admire
again
and
all
for
the
fun
of
it
if
he
is
ordered
to
create
a
certain
design
or
a
number
of
objects
at
a
fixed
price
in
a
given
time
he
loses
his
inspiration
the
play
becomes
work
and
hateful
work
so
he
too
does
not
want
to
work
except
what
is
requisite
to
maintain
himself
in
a
position
to
do
those
things
that
he
likes
better
your
idea
of
life
however
is
to
create
the
useful
and
the
profitable
whether
he
has
any
use
or
profit
out
of
it
or
not
and
to
keep
busy
busy
to
bestir
himself
like
the
devil
in
a
holy
water
font
like
all
other
people
he
makes
a
special
virtue
of
his
own
natural
tendencies
and
wants
all
the
world
to
get
busy
it
does
so
much
matter
to
what
end
this
business
is
to
be
conducted
provided
the
individual
whenever
a
true
seeks
to
enjoy
himself
he
makes
work
out
of
that
too
after
the
manner
of
a
certain
venerable
english
shopkeeper
who
in
company
with
his
son
visited
the
louvre
being
tired
out
with
walking
from
room
to
room
consulting
his
catalogue
and
reading
artists
names
he
dropped
down
to
rest
but
after
a
few
moments
rose
resolutely
and
faced
the
next
room
saying
well
alfred
we
better
be
getting
through
our
work
there
is
much
question
as
to
the
origin
of
the
various
instincts
most
people
have
the
impression
that
the
chief
source
of
variation
lies
in
the
difference
in
the
amount
of
sunlight
received
in
the
native
countries
inhabited
of
the
various
races
whatever
the
origin
is
these
are
the
broadly
marked
tendencies
of
the
people
and
business
seems
bent
not
only
upon
fulfilling
its
own
destiny
but
upon
making
all
the
others
fulfill
it
too
which
is
both
unjust
and
stupid
there
is
room
enough
in
the
world
for
the
races
to
try
out
their
several
tendencies
and
make
their
independent
contributions
to
the
achievements
of
humanity
without
imposing
them
on
those
who
revolt
at
them
granting
that
the
population
of
mexico
if
freed
from
this
foreign
busy
idea
which
the
government
imported
from
the
north
and
imposed
on
them
with
such
severity
in
the
last
forty
years
would
not
immediately
adopt
improved
methods
of
cultivation
even
when
they
should
have
free
opportunity
to
do
so
still
we
have
no
reason
to
conclude
that
they
would
not
adopt
so
much
of
it
as
would
fit
idea
of
what
a
man
is
alive
for
and
if
that
actually
proved
good
it
would
introduce
still
further
development
so
that
there
would
be
a
natural
and
therefore
solid
economic
growth
which
would
stick
while
a
forced
development
of
it
through
the
devastation
of
the
people
is
no
true
growth
the
only
way
to
make
it
go
is
to
kill
out
the
indians
altogether
and
transport
the
busy
crowd
there
and
then
keep
on
transporting
for
several
generations
to
fill
up
the
ravages
the
climate
will
make
on
such
an
imported
population
the
indian
population
of
our
states
was
in
fact
dealt
with
in
this
murderous
manner
i
do
not
know
how
grateful
the
reflection
may
be
to
those
who
materially
profited
by
its
extermination
but
no
one
who
looks
forward
to
the
final
unification
and
liberation
of
man
to
the
incorporation
of
the
several
goodnesses
of
the
various
races
in
the
one
universal
race
can
ever
read
those
pages
of
our
history
without
burning
shame
and
fathomless
regret
i
have
spoken
of
the
meaning
of
revolution
in
general
of
the
meaning
of
the
mexican
revolution
chiefly
an
agrarian
one
of
its
present
condition
i
think
it
should
be
apparent
to
you
that
in
spite
of
the
electoral
victory
of
the
now
ruling
power
it
has
not
put
an
end
even
to
the
armed
rebellion
and
can
not
until
it
proposes
some
plan
of
land
restoration
and
that
it
not
only
has
no
inward
disposition
to
do
but
probably
would
not
dare
to
do
in
view
of
the
fact
that
immense
capital
financed
it
into
power
as
to
what
amount
of
popular
sentiment
was
actually
voiced
in
the
election
it
is
impossible
to
say
the
dailies
informed
us
that
in
the
federal
district
where
there
are
voters
the
actual
vote
was
less
than
they
offered
no
explanation
it
is
impossible
to
explain
it
on
the
ground
that
we
explain
a
light
vote
in
our
own
communities
that
the
people
are
indifferent
to
public
questions
for
the
people
of
mexico
are
not
now
whatever
else
they
may
be
two
explanations
are
possible
the
first
and
most
probable
that
of
intimidation
the
second
that
the
people
are
convinced
of
the
uselessness
of
voting
as
a
means
of
settling
their
troubles
in
the
less
thickly
populated
agricultural
states
very
largely
the
case
they
are
relying
upon
direct
revolutionary
action
but
although
there
was
guerilla
warfare
in
the
federal
district
even
before
the
election
i
find
it
unlikely
that
more
than
half
the
voting
population
there
abstained
from
voting
out
of
conviction
though
i
should
be
glad
to
be
able
to
believe
they
did
however
madero
and
his
aids
are
in
as
was
expected
the
question
is
how
will
they
stay
in
as
diaz
did
and
in
no
other
way
if
they
succeed
in
developing
diaz
sometime
ability
which
so
far
they
are
wide
from
having
done
though
they
are
resorting
to
the
most
vindictive
and
spiteful
tactics
in
their
persecution
of
the
genuine
revolutionists
wherever
such
come
near
their
clutch
to
this
whole
turbulent
situation
three
outcomes
are
possible
a
military
dictator
must
arise
with
sense
enough
to
make
some
substantial
concessions
and
ability
enough
to
pursue
the
crushing
policy
ably
or
the
united
states
must
intervene
in
the
interests
of
american
capitalists
and
landholders
in
case
the
peasant
revolt
is
not
put
down
by
the
maderist
power
and
that
will
be
the
worst
thing
that
can
possibly
happen
and
against
which
every
worker
in
the
united
states
should
protest
with
all
his
might
or
the
mexican
peasantry
will
be
successful
and
freedom
in
land
become
an
actual
fact
and
that
means
the
of
great
in
this
country
also
for
what
people
is
going
to
see
its
neighbor
enjoy
so
great
a
triumph
and
sit
on
tamely
itself
under
landlordism
whatever
the
outcome
be
one
thing
is
certain
it
is
a
movement
which
all
the
people
of
the
world
should
be
eagerly
watching
yet
as
i
said
at
the
beginning
the
majority
of
our
population
know
no
more
about
it
than
of
a
revolt
on
the
planet
jupiter
first
because
they
are
so
so
they
scarcely
have
time
to
look
over
the
baseball
score
and
the
wrestling
match
how
they
read
up
on
a
revolution
second
they
are
supremely
egotistic
and
concerned
in
their
own
big
country
with
its
big
deeds
such
as
divorce
scandals
and
auto
races
third
they
do
not
read
spanish
and
they
have
an
ancient
hostility
to
all
that
smells
spanish
fourth
from
our
cradles
we
were
told
that
whatever
happened
in
mexico
was
a
joke
revolutions
or
rather
rebellions
came
and
went
about
like
april
showers
and
they
never
meant
anything
serious
and
in
this
indeed
there
was
only
too
much
truth
it
was
usually
an
excuse
for
one
to
get
another
one
scalp
and
lastly
as
i
have
said
the
majority
of
our
people
do
not
know
that
a
revolution
means
a
fundamental
change
in
social
life
and
not
a
spectacular
display
of
armies
it
is
not
much
a
few
can
do
to
remove
this
mountain
of
indifference
but
to
me
it
seems
that
every
reformer
of
whatever
school
should
wish
to
watch
this
movement
with
the
most
intense
interest
as
a
practical
manifestation
of
a
wakening
of
the
landworkers
themselves
to
the
recognition
of
what
all
schools
of
revolutionary
economics
admit
to
be
the
primal
necessity
the
social
repossession
of
the
land
and
whether
they
be
victorious
or
defeated
i
for
one
bow
my
head
to
those
heroic
strugglers
no
matter
how
ignorant
they
are
who
have
raised
the
cry
land
and
liberty
and
planted
the
banner
on
the
burning
soil
of
mexico
thomas
paine
to
speak
of
thomas
paine
is
to
mention
in
one
breath
daring
tempered
by
judgment
courage
both
mental
and
physical
foresight
and
prudence
coupled
with
unstinted
generosity
patience
and
endurance
for
the
long
race
constancy
to
the
unwon
ideal
that
superior
power
over
men
conferred
by
no
extrinsic
dictum
typified
best
perhaps
by
the
loadstone
which
always
bursts
forth
in
times
of
revolution
from
the
unexpected
place
the
unbought
and
the
unsought
glory
of
the
man
who
is
a
hero
because
a
hero
is
required
and
does
not
measure
his
services
nor
reckon
on
their
reward
not
that
he
underrates
himself
it
is
as
impossible
as
it
is
undesirable
that
a
powerful
personality
should
not
know
itself
as
such
but
simply
that
in
the
moment
of
decisions
the
value
of
self
is
abandoned
so
far
as
any
or
all
of
these
qualities
are
concerned
thomas
paine
is
a
name
for
them
all
in
their
highest
expression
and
one
feels
in
approaching
him
that
there
is
something
like
treason
in
paying
him
any
but
a
perfect
tribute
yet
such
is
the
position
into
which
i
am
forced
to
say
less
than
i
should
less
than
i
would
had
not
words
and
the
art
of
using
them
almost
failed
me
i
do
not
like
lecturers
who
come
before
the
public
with
apologies
nor
do
i
propose
to
make
any
i
simply
say
this
to
let
you
know
that
i
shall
feel
perhaps
more
keenly
than
any
of
you
my
failure
to
do
paine
justice
for
the
half
century
that
his
history
has
been
being
unmined
from
the
cellar
of
calumny
and
filth
that
the
orthodox
had
cast
upon
it
unmined
chiefly
by
small
groups
of
freethinkers
scattered
here
and
there
and
spreading
his
words
among
men
like
the
little
foxes
with
the
firebrands
going
in
among
the
corn
the
principal
endeavor
has
been
to
establish
paine
reputation
as
a
great
reformer
in
religion
and
such
he
undoubtedly
was
whoever
reads
his
age
of
reason
in
anything
but
a
spirit
of
predisposition
against
it
must
feel
this
however
much
he
may
disagree
with
paine
criticism
or
consider
that
he
has
come
short
in
his
constructive
philosophy
and
it
is
meet
too
that
the
book
that
cost
him
most
both
before
and
after
death
should
be
the
one
selected
for
defense
nevertheless
the
effect
has
been
rather
to
lose
sight
of
what
appear
to
me
greater
thoughts
and
acts
for
just
as
the
orthodox
have
forgotten
so
have
many
freethinkers
forgotten
his
immense
labors
in
the
field
of
active
struggle
against
the
domination
of
man
by
man
it
is
true
that
his
mind
did
not
transcend
the
mental
vesture
of
the
time
and
it
was
all
the
better
in
one
of
his
marvelous
capacities
for
masses
of
men
that
it
did
not
the
lonely
heralds
of
the
opening
dawn
go
upon
their
paths
solitary
no
matter
how
much
they
desire
to
draw
others
with
them
they
can
not
and
had
paine
been
one
of
these
that
break
through
the
forms
of
thought
such
as
was
copernicus
or
kant
or
darwin
he
would
have
been
at
constant
war
with
himself
half
his
nature
would
have
chosen
the
lonely
path
the
other
half
the
zealot
the
propagandist
would
have
cried
out
they
go
with
me
i
must
do
something
to
make
them
me
now
the
secret
of
success
was
that
he
was
so
thoroughly
at
one
with
himself
he
believed
so
utterly
what
he
preached
he
had
faith
he
hoped
and
so
strongly
that
others
were
drawn
to
believe
and
to
hope
for
spite
of
all
intellectual
pride
this
is
the
man
whom
we
love
and
admire
this
is
the
man
who
overcomes
us
who
gets
his
way
this
man
consistent
in
himself
who
has
a
remedy
for
the
world
wrongs
and
hopes
from
it
from
the
point
of
vantage
of
years
experience
it
is
seen
that
paine
political
creed
like
his
religious
one
will
no
longer
fit
but
that
does
not
matter
neither
will
ours
fit
in
a
hundred
years
and
none
of
us
no
not
one
is
great
enough
to
foresee
where
the
misfit
will
arise
it
is
not
our
business
to
bear
the
evils
of
the
thrice
unborn
upon
our
necks
nor
was
it
paine
to
bear
ours
yet
while
not
claiming
for
him
the
prophetic
gift
it
is
still
true
that
he
did
see
the
moral
patchwork
in
our
constitution
the
trouble
of
brewing
and
the
greater
trouble
of
when
he
first
came
to
this
country
he
wrote
a
number
of
contributions
to
the
in
one
of
which
he
pleaded
justice
for
the
negro
basing
his
plea
then
as
always
upon
the
natural
equality
of
man
irrespective
of
color
afterwards
when
the
constitution
was
framed
he
objected
that
nothing
had
been
done
for
the
negro
and
in
his
letters
to
the
american
people
written
after
his
imprisonment
in
france
in
which
the
constitution
was
caustically
reviewed
he
cries
out
again
for
this
yoked
man
not
yet
to
be
freed
for
more
than
half
a
hundred
years
foreseeing
that
nothing
good
can
in
the
end
come
from
slavery
that
every
evil
must
bring
a
compensating
evil
the
soldiers
graves
in
the
national
cemeteries
the
thousands
of
limping
haggard
tatters
and
rags
of
white
men
attest
how
well
paine
foresaw
time
revenges
in
the
letter
to
washington
partially
unjust
as
it
is
in
view
of
the
fact
that
gouverneur
morris
and
not
washington
was
responsible
for
the
failure
to
save
paine
from
prison
in
france
as
we
now
know
thanks
to
moncure
conway
but
which
paine
did
know
in
this
letter
i
say
will
be
found
the
most
terrible
arraignment
of
the
constitution
ever
penned
we
who
are
anarchists
are
called
traitors
for
much
calmer
talk
yet
here
was
the
man
whose
pen
had
done
more
for
the
revolution
than
washington
sword
as
his
bitterest
enemy
declared
who
believed
heart
and
soul
in
the
republic
who
had
given
his
money
and
his
substance
and
taken
the
chances
of
his
life
in
battle
for
it
the
man
whose
devotion
to
america
could
not
be
gainsaid
this
man
declared
that
the
american
constitution
was
the
mirror
of
the
most
vicious
features
of
the
british
constitution
a
fecund
soil
for
monopolies
with
all
their
ills
it
is
we
who
experience
those
ills
we
who
know
what
a
gigantic
tool
of
oppression
the
constitution
and
the
cumbersome
machinery
of
the
lawmaking
power
have
become
yet
probably
even
we
do
not
feel
so
keenly
as
he
the
fatal
blunder
for
while
we
know
how
it
grinds
us
in
our
flesh
and
souls
rears
its
prisons
and
scaffolds
for
us
we
have
had
the
yoke
about
our
necks
always
while
he
once
the
country
free
he
had
been
through
all
the
battle
had
fought
his
fight
and
won
his
victory
only
to
see
it
lost
through
cowardice
of
thought
that
was
indeed
bitter
and
it
is
that
bitter
outcry
against
this
sacrifice
which
marks
paine
out
among
most
of
his
time
for
influence
on
future
history
the
fact
that
he
was
the
initiator
of
the
direct
movement
for
political
independence
in
america
in
the
famous
meeting
where
adams
franklin
and
washington
all
shrank
from
uttering
the
thought
heavy
upon
their
souls
is
a
matter
of
past
history
the
fact
that
he
was
the
one
man
in
america
to
write
the
right
thing
at
the
right
time
his
voice
the
wind
to
sweep
the
scattering
flames
of
insubordination
and
revolt
into
the
conflagration
of
revolution
the
fact
that
he
proposed
and
headed
with
the
whole
contents
of
his
purse
the
subscription
to
save
the
army
when
even
washington
was
in
despair
at
the
prospect
of
mutiny
and
desertion
among
the
soldiers
the
fact
that
he
raised
all
the
feeling
possible
against
the
fiction
of
divine
rights
and
so
got
himself
hunted
out
of
england
the
fact
that
he
took
the
most
active
part
possible
in
aiding
the
work
of
the
french
revolutionists
which
he
believed
would
be
the
beginning
of
the
breakdown
of
monarchy
throughout
europe
and
the
building
up
either
of
one
universal
continental
republic
or
a
confederation
of
sister
republics
the
fact
that
he
was
the
one
man
in
the
convention
who
dared
to
stand
for
the
life
of
louis
the
xvi
and
thereby
got
himself
suspected
thrown
into
prison
and
condemned
to
death
all
these
facts
are
of
import
in
reading
the
character
of
the
man
and
in
comprehending
the
record
of
those
days
when
they
were
making
history
fast
yet
none
of
these
has
so
much
influence
upon
the
demands
of
as
the
voice
of
discontent
crying
for
eternal
vigilance
which
sounds
through
these
almost
unknown
letters
these
are
the
things
which
it
will
pay
to
reprint
in
the
day
when
american
liberty
feels
in
its
tomb
the
first
stirrings
of
the
resurrection
did
we
like
paine
believe
in
god
we
might
say
pray
god
it
may
not
be
far
away
such
are
the
characters
whose
historic
influence
is
greatest
they
who
hew
and
hew
hard
to
the
line
laid
down
for
them
by
the
events
of
their
time
yet
are
not
blinded
by
the
stir
and
roll
of
things
who
see
clearly
where
the
deflection
from
the
line
is
likely
to
occur
and
where
it
will
lead
who
raise
the
warning
treble
that
goes
shrilling
to
the
future
startling
waking
with
its
eerie
cry
ears
and
sodden
souls
who
start
to
ask
was
it
not
a
ghost
of
the
revolution
in
that
day
which
may
not
be
so
distant
as
we
fear
paine
will
be
more
alive
than
ever
he
will
be
watching
at
a
million
firesides
with
the
old
keen
strong
eyes
while
i
have
deprecated
the
fact
that
the
religious
reformer
has
been
exalted
to
the
neglect
of
the
political
one
i
can
not
omit
that
part
of
his
so
to
all
yet
never
old
the
age
of
reason
has
long
been
both
exaggerated
and
despised
as
an
iconoclastic
work
but
we
are
indebted
to
conway
the
greatest
of
paine
students
who
out
of
the
many
biographies
he
has
written
has
chosen
that
of
paine
to
be
the
of
his
life
and
it
is
a
work
which
any
author
might
be
proud
to
regard
his
to
him
i
say
we
are
indebted
for
a
different
view
of
the
age
of
reason
i
know
not
whether
conway
own
unitarian
bias
may
not
have
influenced
him
it
is
possible
it
is
possible
that
his
eager
search
for
positivism
may
have
unconsciously
determined
his
attitude
towards
the
great
hero
and
modified
his
interpretation
of
paine
words
i
believe
it
has
because
i
believe
is
inevitable
i
believe
we
read
our
own
ideals
into
other
people
and
must
do
so
if
we
think
at
all
but
making
all
allowance
for
the
biographer
prejudgment
conway
has
still
a
magnificent
argument
for
putting
paine
in
the
defendant
position
we
are
no
longer
to
view
the
book
as
an
attack
upon
religion
but
as
its
defense
the
defense
of
what
is
beneficial
permanent
necessary
in
the
religious
element
of
human
nature
against
the
scribes
and
pharisees
on
the
one
hand
and
the
philistines
on
the
other
it
was
the
plea
for
the
redemption
of
the
edifice
from
the
dirt
and
cobwebs
the
protest
against
smashing
the
stones
to
kill
the
spiders
the
great
prerequisite
to
the
understanding
of
the
age
of
reason
is
an
acquaintance
with
the
literature
of
that
time
especially
french
literature
the
pamphlets
periodicals
and
books
are
the
crystals
wherein
of
the
century
is
preserved
without
this
acquaintance
we
can
not
realize
how
the
people
continually
thought
and
what
was
new
and
what
was
old
what
was
acceptable
and
what
unacceptable
to
them
and
we
shall
find
by
it
that
the
fashion
of
sneering
popularized
by
voltaire
and
so
admirably
embodied
by
the
of
the
french
language
always
a
language
of
double
meanings
and
insinuations
the
still
more
reprehensible
habit
of
deducing
immense
generals
from
very
scanty
particulars
or
in
fact
contriving
the
generals
first
and
then
fitting
in
or
suavely
waiving
the
particulars
altogether
had
so
permeated
not
only
french
philosophy
but
the
heads
of
the
common
people
as
well
that
religion
had
become
almost
a
byword
a
baseless
superstition
unaccounted
for
by
and
unnecessary
according
to
the
theory
of
natural
law
to
defend
it
to
maintain
that
there
was
something
else
in
it
was
equivalent
to
pleading
for
the
life
of
the
king
before
the
convention
that
was
to
maintain
that
there
were
claims
of
the
human
after
the
king
had
been
stripped
this
was
to
say
that
underneath
the
gewgaws
and
tinsel
of
religions
the
undying
heart
of
man
the
man
of
all
the
past
had
been
expressing
its
noblest
aspirations
and
paine
stripped
off
the
tinsel
and
said
put
your
hand
here
it
beats
and
because
he
tore
the
tinsel
the
orthodox
would
have
stoned
him
and
because
he
said
it
beats
the
philosophers
would
have
whetted
the
knife
and
between
the
two
he
stood
firm
proclaiming
what
he
believed
not
counting
the
cost
we
may
not
believe
as
he
most
of
us
do
not
but
that
is
the
man
we
love
who
has
something
in
him
superior
to
the
judgments
of
men
who
holds
steadfast
steadfast
even
in
persecution
even
to
death
perhaps
there
is
no
more
pathetic
thing
than
the
last
years
the
death
and
the
burial
of
paine
the
world
would
have
been
poorer
had
he
died
sooner
but
to
him
to
the
man
the
or
the
guillotine
had
been
kinder
than
the
unhappy
life
rejected
by
the
nation
he
had
given
all
to
free
shunned
by
political
cowards
and
persecuted
by
religious
bigots
even
on
his
but
though
so
lonely
so
pathetically
lonely
there
is
something
that
sends
a
fine
cold
thrill
along
the
nerves
in
that
strange
procession
and
burial
that
poor
procession
that
procession
of
the
hicksite
quaker
the
two
negroes
the
widowed
frenchwoman
and
her
son
i
wonder
what
sort
of
day
it
was
whether
the
sun
shone
or
the
clouds
lowered
over
the
solitary
grave
on
the
little
farm
when
margaret
bonneville
said
to
her
child
stand
you
there
at
his
feet
for
france
and
i
will
here
for
america
i
do
not
know
where
the
negroes
and
the
hicksite
stood
when
that
august
corpse
was
lowered
to
the
depths
but
there
close
somewhere
stood
the
unfreed
race
for
whom
he
had
vainly
plead
and
there
close
somewhere
the
soul
revolt
at
spiritual
masters
and
from
that
tomb
there
went
away
the
scattering
fires
of
the
risen
ghost
the
living
paine
the
grand
reality
dyer
lum
february
april
one
of
the
silent
martyrs
whose
graves
are
trodden
to
the
level
by
their
fellows
feet
almost
before
it
is
seen
that
they
have
fallen
completed
his
martyrdom
one
year
ago
there
are
thousands
of
such
why
then
commemorate
this
one
let
our
answer
be
that
in
this
one
we
commemorate
all
the
others
and
if
we
have
chosen
his
day
and
name
it
is
because
his
genius
his
work
his
character
was
one
of
those
rare
gems
produced
in
the
great
mine
of
suffering
and
flashing
backward
with
all
its
changing
lights
the
hopes
the
fears
the
gaieties
the
griefs
the
dreams
the
doubts
the
loves
the
hates
the
sum
of
that
which
is
buried
low
down
there
in
the
human
mine
no
more
modest
a
man
than
dyer
lum
ever
lived
partly
nay
mostly
indeed
it
was
inborn
instinctive
but
it
was
also
fostered
by
his
conception
of
life
which
led
him
to
consider
self
as
the
veriest
of
a
thing
to
be
dispelled
by
the
merest
whiff
of
wind
so
to
speak
and
therefore
personal
recognition
or
personal
gain
as
the
most
silly
as
well
as
unworthy
of
motives
for
this
reason
his
works
have
often
gone
where
his
name
did
not
and
thousands
of
persons
have
been
influenced
by
his
logic
and
his
sentiments
who
never
heard
of
his
personality
indeed
there
were
some
of
us
who
wondered
when
he
died
what
certain
labor
leaders
would
henceforth
do
for
a
cheap
scribe
to
furnish
them
brains
i
have
often
heard
him
quote
as
his
motto
both
for
organization
and
for
literary
effort
the
expressive
sentence
in
your
let
fools
take
the
credit
if
they
want
it
was
the
implication
of
his
tone
and
i
shall
never
forget
the
delightful
smile
with
which
he
repeated
charles
mackay
lines
most
singularly
transposing
the
meaning
grub
little
moles
he
took
an
especial
pleasure
in
grubbing
and
smiling
when
a
streak
of
sunlight
fell
on
some
one
else
i
have
said
that
this
distinguishing
characteristic
so
fruitful
in
results
in
his
later
life
was
partly
instinctive
and
partly
a
philosophic
conviction
the
instinctive
side
may
be
best
understood
by
a
brief
sketch
of
his
ancestry
it
is
generally
complained
that
the
troublesome
people
who
are
never
satisfied
to
let
society
alone
must
necessarily
be
foreigners
at
least
they
can
never
belong
to
the
same
nation
as
we
the
good
the
respectable
the
easy
method
of
laying
everything
pestilent
to
the
charge
of
the
foreigner
will
not
serve
a
conservative
american
against
dyer
lum
the
first
of
the
lums
to
set
foot
in
this
country
was
samuel
a
scotchman
in
the
year
they
rooted
in
new
england
soil
and
at
the
time
of
the
revolution
great
grandfather
was
a
in
the
very
town
northampton
where
his
own
corpse
was
laid
a
year
ago
on
the
maternal
side
the
tappan
family
were
also
revolutionists
and
back
of
revolutionists
reformationists
in
the
days
of
queen
elizabeth
and
still
back
of
that
crusaders
all
this
would
be
important
enough
and
indeed
even
distinguishing
were
i
relating
it
by
way
of
gilding
refined
gold
but
they
acquire
meaning
the
moment
we
regard
them
as
data
for
a
character
they
are
fraught
with
mysterious
symbolism
and
he
himself
becomes
a
symbol
of
the
faith
of
humanity
when
we
see
that
subterranean
stream
of
blood
running
from
jerusalem
through
europe
and
across
the
sea
to
america
it
shows
how
profound
is
the
of
devotion
to
cause
in
the
human
heart
through
how
many
centuries
the
spirit
of
rebellion
lives
but
what
say
you
had
it
to
do
with
his
instinctive
modesty
this
devotee
of
a
cause
is
never
the
devotee
of
now
as
to
his
philosophic
convictions
it
would
be
easy
to
deliver
a
whole
lecture
upon
them
and
unfortunately
his
profoundest
work
on
that
subject
has
not
yet
been
printed
of
course
i
can
present
them
but
briefly
i
must
preface
that
as
you
will
no
doubt
observe
later
on
his
beliefs
were
in
his
own
case
a
plain
testimony
to
their
own
correctness
it
sounds
ridiculous
to
say
that
a
thing
can
prove
itself
but
you
will
understand
me
when
i
explain
that
he
regarded
the
conscious
life
of
man
which
includes
of
course
his
processes
of
reasoning
and
therefore
his
philosophy
as
the
merest
fragment
of
him
that
this
process
itself
which
we
are
wont
so
fondly
to
consider
as
setting
us
higher
than
the
brute
is
but
an
upgrowth
of
our
instincts
man
the
race
man
psychologically
as
well
as
bodily
might
be
likened
to
a
tree
which
every
year
adds
small
new
growths
whose
bright
green
verdure
opens
to
the
sunlight
while
below
and
supporting
them
quivers
the
great
dark
green
mass
of
the
tree
which
year
after
year
repeats
itself
whispering
in
its
shadows
the
old
whispers
of
the
centuries
the
new
verdure
would
represent
the
conscious
life
and
growth
of
individuals
budding
upward
in
response
to
the
conditions
surrounding
them
and
adding
what
tiny
mite
they
may
to
the
experience
of
the
race
but
beneath
and
through
and
all
about
them
rustle
the
traditions
of
the
dead
dead
as
individuals
but
living
more
potently
living
than
ever
in
the
great
trunk
and
branches
of
unconscious
or
instinctive
life
and
as
the
shape
of
the
newly
budding
leaf
the
shade
of
its
green
the
length
of
its
stem
its
size
are
determined
more
by
the
nature
of
the
tree
than
by
surrounding
circumstances
so
the
philosophy
of
the
individual
is
determined
by
the
instinctive
life
of
the
race
the
winter
of
death
comes
the
individual
withers
like
the
leaf
but
the
small
item
of
growth
that
he
has
added
is
there
brown
and
barren
though
the
twig
appear
from
him
new
buds
will
shoot
though
its
own
leaves
hereafter
rustle
in
the
deep
green
shadows
of
unconsciousness
as
time
passes
away
useless
boughs
wither
and
die
and
are
stricken
utterly
from
the
life
of
the
race
such
are
the
worthless
lives
the
abnormal
growths
which
no
longer
add
anything
either
to
the
beauty
or
the
service
of
the
whole
or
to
adopt
one
of
comrade
lum
own
figures
the
useless
or
brutish
elements
in
man
slowly
sink
down
like
sediment
deposited
by
the
moving
current
now
in
a
case
where
we
are
able
to
trace
a
strain
of
blood
as
far
back
as
this
of
his
and
further
are
able
to
look
at
the
conscious
work
of
the
man
and
see
that
the
one
was
the
offspring
of
the
other
modified
of
course
by
circumstances
we
are
able
to
make
the
seemingly
absurd
statement
that
the
belief
proves
its
own
correctness
let
me
particularize
concerning
this
belief
first
he
was
in
all
his
writings
the
advocate
of
resistance
the
champion
of
rebellion
but
long
before
he
had
reduced
the
matter
to
a
syllogism
he
was
a
resistant
in
fact
what
else
could
you
expect
from
the
crusader
the
reformationist
the
revolutionist
it
might
be
said
by
the
people
who
believe
in
the
supreme
influence
of
circumstances
that
it
was
his
social
environment
which
made
him
such
that
given
the
ideal
social
order
and
he
would
have
been
as
mild
a
pacificator
as
jesus
which
is
equivalent
to
saying
that
given
the
outward
circumstances
and
an
ear
of
wheat
will
grow
from
a
seed
corn
lum
was
the
resistant
the
man
of
action
the
man
who
while
scarcely
more
than
a
boy
enlisted
as
a
volunteer
in
the
new
york
infantry
to
fight
a
cause
he
then
deemed
just
who
being
taken
prisoner
twice
effected
his
escape
who
sick
of
the
inaction
of
superiors
while
a
prisoner
waiting
to
be
exchanged
took
his
exchange
in
his
own
hands
at
the
risk
of
death
for
desertion
and
within
a
month
in
the
cavalry
where
by
sheer
force
of
daring
he
rose
from
private
to
captain
the
man
who
smashed
the
idol
of
the
greenback
movement
sooner
than
let
him
betray
its
voters
reckless
himself
of
the
rebound
of
hate
from
the
politicians
the
man
who
cast
all
business
prospects
and
journalistic
hopes
aside
as
so
much
chaff
when
he
picked
up
the
fallen
banner
of
the
fight
in
chicago
by
editing
the
paper
of
albert
parsons
then
in
prison
and
doomed
to
die
the
man
who
could
say
to
his
friend
when
that
friend
asked
him
whether
he
should
petition
governor
oglesby
for
his
life
knowing
that
that
petition
would
be
granted
the
man
who
under
these
circumstances
could
say
die
parsons
the
man
who
poor
defeated
dirty
ragged
hungry
could
proudly
refuse
the
proffered
hand
of
the
then
king
of
the
labor
movement
that
king
who
had
kept
his
kingdom
by
repudiating
the
martyrs
of
chicago
from
the
limitless
height
of
one
soul
over
another
answer
there
blood
on
it
powderly
the
man
who
faced
a
public
audience
to
defend
the
shooting
of
frick
by
alexander
berkman
a
few
days
after
the
occurrence
because
he
felt
that
when
another
has
done
a
thing
which
you
approve
as
leading
in
the
direction
of
your
own
aspirations
it
is
your
duty
to
share
the
effects
of
the
counterblast
his
action
may
have
provoked
the
man
who
seized
the
unknown
monster
death
with
a
smile
on
his
lips
all
of
this
man
was
germinating
in
the
child
of
the
pious
home
who
even
when
a
mere
boy
had
dared
jehovah
having
weighed
him
tried
him
found
him
naught
he
threw
the
jewish
god
and
cosmogony
overboard
with
as
much
equanimity
as
he
would
have
eaten
his
dinner
and
set
about
finding
a
more
reasonable
explanation
of
phenomena
in
this
as
in
all
other
matters
the
man
of
action
has
a
certain
advantage
over
a
pure
theorist
which
is
this
he
plunges
immediately
into
the
conflict
he
throws
the
gauntlet
rashly
sometimes
but
boldly
he
settles
the
question
at
once
if
there
is
any
suffering
attached
to
the
attempt
he
suffers
once
and
has
done
with
it
while
the
theorist
the
fellow
who
walks
tiptoe
round
the
edge
of
the
dies
a
hundred
times
and
still
suffers
on
my
own
conversion
from
orthodoxy
to
freethought
was
of
this
latter
sort
i
never
dared
god
i
always
tried
to
propitiate
him
with
prayers
and
tears
even
while
i
was
doubting
his
existence
i
suffered
hell
a
thousand
times
while
i
was
wondering
where
it
was
located
but
my
teacher
winked
at
the
heavens
braved
hell
and
then
tossed
the
whole
affair
aside
with
a
joke
nevertheless
he
did
not
as
nearly
all
of
our
modern
have
done
deny
all
religions
in
their
entirety
because
he
had
run
a
lance
through
a
stuffed
indeed
the
spirit
of
devotion
to
something
greater
than
self
which
will
be
found
as
the
kernel
of
every
religion
was
so
thoroughly
in
him
or
indeed
he
himself
that
whether
he
fancied
himself
it
or
not
his
inclinations
directed
all
his
conscious
efforts
to
read
the
riddle
of
life
into
the
channel
of
buddhism
i
do
not
know
whether
he
ever
accepted
its
peculiarly
fanciful
side
or
not
but
if
he
did
it
was
early
corrected
by
a
no
less
characteristic
trait
also
an
inheritance
of
the
tappan
family
that
of
critical
analysis
an
omnivorous
reader
he
was
always
abreast
of
the
times
in
matters
of
scientific
discovery
and
his
inexorable
logic
would
never
have
permitted
him
to
retain
a
creed
which
necessitated
any
doctoring
of
facts
he
rather
doctored
the
creed
to
fit
the
facts
and
thus
evolved
a
species
of
modern
buddhism
which
he
called
evolutional
ethics
whose
principles
may
be
briefly
stated
as
follows
man
is
the
continuation
of
the
process
of
evolution
up
to
date
he
is
thus
united
to
all
other
products
of
evolution
and
is
governed
by
the
same
laws
the
two
factors
which
determine
form
in
the
organic
world
are
and
and
since
evolution
is
no
less
a
matter
of
psychology
than
physiology
the
soul
of
man
as
well
as
the
soul
of
animals
and
plants
must
be
moulded
by
these
factors
that
inheritance
tends
to
crystallize
existing
forms
while
or
the
influence
of
environment
ever
tends
to
modification
of
forms
whether
physical
or
intellectual
that
mind
as
much
as
body
is
unconscious
so
far
as
there
is
perfect
adaptation
to
surroundings
and
that
only
when
inharmony
of
the
organism
with
the
environment
as
the
result
of
change
in
the
latter
arises
can
there
be
that
this
consciousness
is
a
state
of
pain
more
or
less
sharply
defined
and
will
continue
to
increase
in
intensity
until
the
necessary
adaptation
is
accomplished
when
a
a
feeling
of
satisfaction
or
pleasure
will
ensue
gradually
sinking
into
the
blissful
unconsciousness
of
perfect
harmony
that
progress
thus
demands
this
stepping
constantly
up
the
rough
stairway
of
pain
and
that
not
even
one
step
is
passed
until
moistened
by
the
blood
of
many
generations
that
the
path
up
the
mountain
side
is
not
laid
out
us
but
us
and
that
we
travel
there
whether
it
pleases
us
or
not
that
the
chances
are
it
will
please
us
that
our
whole
lives
in
so
far
as
they
are
conscious
will
probably
be
one
record
of
never
achieved
struggle
and
that
rest
will
come
only
when
we
descend
to
the
unconsciousness
of
death
thus
he
was
a
pessimist
of
the
darkest
hue
and
yet
he
never
wasted
a
moment
regret
on
the
facts
he
watched
this
passing
spectre
man
gliding
among
the
whirling
dance
of
atoms
contemplated
his
final
extinction
with
composure
sneered
at
metaphysicians
while
he
himself
was
buried
in
metaphysics
and
cracked
jokes
either
at
his
own
expense
or
somebody
else
the
result
of
all
this
speculation
was
the
conclusion
that
man
being
a
social
animal
must
adapt
himself
to
social
ends
not
determined
by
him
but
for
him
unconsciously
that
therefore
the
one
who
sets
himself
and
his
egotistic
desires
against
the
social
ideal
is
the
supreme
traitor
he
had
a
peculiar
power
of
expressing
volumes
in
an
epithet
and
the
epithet
he
gave
to
the
egoist
was
for
the
sake
of
those
who
may
not
be
familiar
with
the
insect
referred
to
i
may
explain
that
a
is
a
sort
of
bug
that
exhibits
its
instincts
by
rolling
a
ball
of
dung
and
who
sometimes
appears
to
meditate
when
he
rolls
over
the
ball
that
the
universe
has
turned
bottom
up
because
he
has
now
it
is
well
known
that
the
greater
part
of
the
reform
camp
particularly
the
anarchistic
camp
is
made
up
of
i
mean
of
egoists
people
who
declare
that
the
desire
for
pleasure
is
the
motive
of
action
who
think
a
great
deal
of
their
egos
and
do
care
a
rap
for
society
the
result
was
they
sharpened
their
pencils
and
wrote
scathing
editorials
denouncing
him
to
which
he
answered
never
a
word
first
because
he
did
consider
himself
worth
fighting
about
and
second
if
he
had
he
was
altogether
too
good
a
general
to
do
it
his
opponents
were
a
disputatious
sort
who
liked
nothing
better
than
argument
he
knew
what
his
enemy
wanted
and
do
but
when
a
question
worth
discussing
arose
then
woe
to
those
who
had
courted
the
rapier
of
his
wit
or
challenged
to
duel
with
the
dagger
of
his
sarcasm
he
could
answer
columns
with
a
paragraph
i
do
not
know
whether
this
philosophy
of
his
had
crystallized
in
his
own
mind
before
he
became
an
anarchist
or
not
i
believe
however
it
had
not
i
think
it
grew
along
with
his
other
conceptions
being
broadened
and
corrected
and
in
turn
broadening
and
correcting
his
thought
in
other
channels
but
at
any
rate
fully
developed
or
not
it
certainly
influenced
his
conclusions
on
economic
subjects
greatly
true
to
his
instincts
he
was
always
at
the
front
of
battle
and
when
the
war
closed
his
first
move
was
to
attach
himself
to
the
greenback
party
the
first
widespread
expression
of
organized
protest
against
monopoly
of
the
means
of
production
in
america
he
still
had
faith
in
the
saving
grace
of
politics
and
was
active
enough
in
the
agitation
to
be
nominated
for
lieut
governor
of
massachusetts
with
wendell
phillips
for
governor
the
fight
which
besides
being
a
demand
for
fiat
money
embodied
a
movement
took
on
a
national
character
and
dyer
lum
with
five
others
including
albert
parsons
was
appointed
on
a
committee
to
push
the
matter
before
congress
this
was
in
six
years
later
time
and
the
tide
had
driven
both
of
them
into
the
great
current
of
socialism
and
final
repudiation
of
politics
as
a
means
of
attaining
socialistic
ideals
and
here
came
in
the
philosophy
of
the
unconscious
the
socialization
of
industry
was
the
next
step
up
the
mountain
side
not
because
men
wished
or
planned
it
but
the
pressure
of
surroundings
made
it
the
only
possible
move
but
on
the
other
hand
the
reactionary
socialism
advocated
by
the
great
master
marx
and
all
his
train
of
little
repeaters
was
seen
to
be
at
variance
with
a
no
less
marked
feature
of
the
evolving
social
ideal
elasticity
mobility
constantly
increasing
differentiation
which
is
only
possible
when
units
of
society
are
left
free
to
adapt
themselves
to
the
slightest
changes
unforced
by
the
opinions
of
other
people
who
know
nothing
of
the
matters
in
question
but
who
being
in
the
majority
for
where
is
ignorance
not
in
the
majority
could
suppress
the
free
movements
of
the
minority
by
enacting
their
ignorance
into
laws
thus
it
will
be
seen
that
he
looked
forward
to
free
socialism
as
the
industrial
ideal
the
requirements
of
that
ideal
are
laid
down
in
his
economics
of
anarchy
a
few
of
his
caustic
sentences
may
here
be
quoted
the
statist
assumes
that
rights
increase
in
some
metaphysical
manner
and
become
incarnate
in
half
the
whole
plus
one
politics
discovers
wisdom
by
taking
a
general
poll
of
ignorance
every
appeal
to
legislation
to
do
aught
but
is
as
futile
as
sending
a
flag
of
truce
to
the
enemy
for
munitions
of
war
when
caesar
conquered
greece
he
subjugated
olympus
and
the
gods
now
measure
tape
behind
counters
with
christian
decorum
lum
had
faith
in
humankind
he
always
trusted
the
people
the
people
that
maligned
him
the
people
that
injured
him
the
people
that
killed
him
when
i
asked
him
once
why
he
did
not
get
angry
at
an
individual
who
industriously
circulated
lies
about
him
he
answered
with
a
twinkling
laugh
for
the
same
reason
that
i
do
kick
the
and
yet
he
had
an
abiding
faith
in
that
man
and
other
similar
men
to
work
out
the
judgments
of
the
human
race
undisturbed
by
the
fact
that
they
let
their
only
honest
leaders
die
in
garrets
and
underneath
the
speculative
philosopher
who
confused
you
with
long
words
underneath
the
cold
logician
who
mercilessly
scouted
at
sentiment
underneath
the
pessimistic
poet
that
sent
the
mournful
cry
of
the
echoing
through
the
widowed
chambers
of
the
heart
that
hung
and
sung
over
the
festival

and
dirges
of
death

the
gay
joker
who
delighted
to
play
tricks

detectives

the
man
who
took
the
children
on
his
knees
and

them
stories

man
who
gave
up

he
did
not

basket

her
that
she
might

who
gathered
clovers
and
sent
them
to
his
friends

attached

them

man

was
beating

was
one
with
the
simplest
and
the
poorest

held
that
evolutional
ethics

anarchist
ethics

fact

take
account
of

the
altruistic

egoistic
impulses

in
its
quota
of
influence

comprehend
the
trend
of
development

should
take
fair
account
of
ancient
truths

enveloped
in
superstitious
husks
should
aim
to
extract
the
virtue
even
in
the
much
mistaken
altruistic
doctrines
of
vicarious
atonement
and
personal
abasement
and
while
emphasizing
the
negation
of
human
rulership
as
destructive
of
the
possibilities
of
true
growth
at
the

time
to
acknowledge
the
vain
conceit
of
self
as
anything
more
than
a
temporary
grouping
of
instinct
developed
in
beast
in

in

to
acknowledge
the
individual
creature
as
a
sort
of
mirrored
reflection
of
the
cosmos
constantly
shifting
now
scintillant
now
vague
and
evanescent
now
gone
forever
as
death
breaks
the
mirror

notion
of
immortality
which
grows
from
such
a
conception
of
self

purged
of
the
old
vain
conceit
it
has
been
most
beautifully
voiced
in
george

invisible

favorite
poem
and
in
the
lines
is
expressed
the
last
great
limitless
shadow
which
engulfs
even
this
immortality
the
blind
tremendous
darkness
which
lies
at
the
end
of
all
the
sense
of
the
invincibility
of
which
must
have
lain
upon
our
teacher
soul
when
after
the
last
searching
inexplicable
farewell
look
into
a
friend
eyes
he
went
out
into
the
april
night
and
took
his
last
walk
in
the
roar
of
the
great
city
he
who
should
soon
be
so
silent
most
of
his
comrades
were
surprised
they
said
i
never
thought
dyer
lum
would
go
alone
but
i
who
know
how
often
and
how
wearily
he
said
what
the
use
am
sure
that
that
mocking
question
lay
at
his
heart
and
paralyzed
the
to
do
like
olive

in

farm
the
soul
about

depart
sees
the

so
coldly

helpless

out

crawl
awhile

then
go
back

francisco
ferrer
in
all
unsuccessful
social
upheavals
there
are
two
terrors
the
red
that
is
the
people
the
mob
the
white
that
is
the
reprisal
when
a
year
ago
the
lightning
of
the
white
terror
shot
out
of
that
netherest
blackness
of
social
depth
the
spanish
torture
house
and
laid
in
the
ditch
of
montjuich
a
human
being
who
but
a
moment
before
had
been
the
personification
of
manhood
in
the
flower
of
life
in
the
strength
and
pride
of
a
balanced
intellect
full
of
the
purpose
of
a
great
and
growing
undertaking
that
of
the
modern
schools
humanity
at
large
received
a
blow
in
the
face
which
it
could
not
understand
stunned
bewildered
shocked
it
recoiled
and
stood
gaping
with
astonishment
how
to
explain
it
the
average
individual
certainly
the
average
individual
in
america
could
not
believe
it
possible
that
any
group
of
persons
calling
themselves
a
government
let
it
be
of
the
worst
and
most
despotic
could
slay
a
man
for
being
a
teacher
a
teacher
of
modern
sciences
a
builder
of
hygienic
schools
a
publisher
of
no
they
could
not
believe
it
their
minds
staggered
back
and
shook
refusal
it
was
not
so
it
could
not
be
so
the
man
was
shot
that
was
sure
he
was
dead
and
there
was
no
raising
him
out
of
the
ditch
to
question
him
the
spanish
government
had
certainly
proceeded
in
an
unjustifiable
manner
in
him
and
sentencing
him
without
giving
him
a
chance
at
defense
but
surely
he
had
been
guilty
of
something
surely
he
must
have
rioted
or
instigated
riot
or
done
some
desperate
act
of
rebellion
for
never
could
it
be
that
in
the
twentieth
century
a
country
of
europe
could
kill
a
peaceful
man
whose
aim
in
life
was
to
educate
children
in
geography
arithmetic
geology
physics
chemistry
singing
and
languages
no
it
was
not
possible
and
for
all
that
it
was
possible
it
was
done
on
the
of
october
one
year
ago
in
the
face
of
europe
standing
with
tied
hands
to
look
on
at
the
murder
and
from
that
day
on
controversy
between
the
awakened
who
understood
the
reactionists
who
likewise
understood
and
their
followers
on
both
sides
who
have
half
understood
has
surged
up
and
down
and
left
confusion
pretty
badly
confounded
in
the
mind
of
him
who
did
not
understand
but
sought
to
the
men
who
did
him
to
death
and
the
institutions
they
represent
have
done
all
in
their
power
to
create
the
impression
that
ferrer
was
a
believer
in
violence
a
teacher
of
the
principles
of
violence
a
doer
of
acts
of
violence
and
an
instigator
of
widespread
violence
perpetrated
by
a
mass
of
people
in
support
of
the
first
they
have
published
reports
purporting
to
be
his
own
writings
have
pretended
to
reproduce
seditious
pictures
from
the
walls
of
his
have
declared
that
he
was
seen
mingling
with
the
rebels
during
the
catalonian
uprising
of
last
year
and
that
upon
trial
he
was
found
guilty
of
having
conceived
and
launched
the
spanish
rebellion
against
the
moroccan
war
and
that
his
death
was
a
just
act
of
reprisal
on
the
other
hand
we
have
had
a
storm
of
indignant
voices
clamoring
in
his
defense
alternately
admitting
and
denying
him
to
be
a
revolutionist
alternately
contending
that
his
schools
taught
social
rebellion
and
that
they
taught
nothing
but
pure
science
we
have
had
workmen
demonstrating
and
professors
and
litterateurs
protesting
on
very
opposite
grounds
and
almost
none
were
able
to
give
definite
information
for
the
faith
that
was
in
them
and
indeed
it
has
been
very
difficult
to
obtain
exact
information
and
still
is
so
after
a
year
lapse
it
is
yet
not
easy
to
get
the
facts
disentangled
from
the
fancies
the
truths
from
the
lies
and
above
all
from
the
and
even
when
we
have
the
truths
as
to
the
facts
it
is
still
difficult
to
valuate
them
because
of
american
ignorance
of
spanish
ignorance
please
understand
the
phrase
america
has
not
too
much
to
boast
of
in
the
way
of
its
learning
but
yet
it
has
that
much
of
common
knowledge
and
common
education
that
it
does
not
enter
into
our
minds
to
conceive
of
a
population
of
which
are
unable
to
read
and
write
and
a
good
share
of
the
remaining
can
only
read
not
write
neither
does
it
at
all
enter
our
heads
to
think
that
of
this
of
the
better
informed
the
most
powerful
contingent
is
composed
of
those
whose
distinct
avowed
and
deliberate
purpose
it
is
to
keep
the
ignorant
ignorant
whatever
may
be
the
sins
of
government
in
this
country
or
of
the
churches
and
there
are
plenty
of
such
sins
at
least
they
have
not
save
in
the
case
of
negro
slaves
constituted
themselves
a
conspiratical
force
to
keep
out
enlightenment
to
prevent
the
people
from
learning
to
read
and
write
or
to
acquire
whatever
scientific
knowledge
their
economic
circumstances
permitted
them
to
what
the
unconscious
conspiracy
of
economic
circumstance
has
done
and
what
conscious
manipulations
the
government
school
is
guilty
of
to
render
higher
education
a
privilege
of
the
rich
and
a
maintainer
of
injustice
is
another
matter
but
it
can
not
be
charged
that
the
rulers
of
america
seek
to
render
the
people
illiterate
people
therefore
who
have
grown
up
in
a
general
atmosphere
of
thought
which
regards
the
government
as
a
provider
of
education
even
as
a
compeller
of
education
do
not
unless
their
attention
is
drawn
to
the
facts
conceive
of
a
state
of
society
in
which
government
is
a
hostile
force
opposed
to
the
enlightenment
of
the
people
its
politicians
exercising
all
their
ingenuity
to
sidetrack
the
demand
of
the
people
for
schools
how
much
less
do
they
conceive
the
hostile
force
and
power
of
a
church
having
behind
it
an
unbroken
descent
from
feudal
ages
whose
direct
interest
it
is
to
maintain
a
closed
monopoly
of
learning
and
to
keep
out
of
general
circulation
all
scientific
information
which
would
tend
to
destroy
the
superstitions
whereby
it
thrives
i
say
that
the
american
people
in
general
are
not
informed
as
to
these
conditions
and
therefore
the
phenomenon
of
a
teacher
killed
for
instituting
and
maintaining
schools
staggers
their
belief
and
when
they
read
the
assertions
of
those
who
defend
the
murder
that
it
was
because
his
schools
were
instigating
the
overthrow
of
social
order
in
spain
they
naturally
exclaim
ah
that
explains
it
the
man
taught
sedition
rebellion
riot
in
his
schools
that
is
the
reason
now
the
truth
is
that
what
ferrer
was
teaching
in
his
schools
was
really
instigating
the
overthrow
of
the
social
order
of
spain
furthermore
it
was
not
only
instigating
it
but
it
was
making
it
as
certain
as
the
still
coming
of
the
daylight
out
of
the
night
of
the
east
but
not
by
the
teaching
of
riot
of
the
use
of
dagger
bomb
or
knife
but
by
the
teaching
of
the
same
sciences
which
are
taught
in
our
public
schools
through
a
generally
diffused
knowledge
of
which
the
power
of
spain
despotic
church
must
crumble
away
likewise
it
was
laying
the
primary
foundation
for
the
overthrow
of
such
portions
of
the
state
organization
as
exist
by
reason
of
the
general
ignorance
of
the
people
the
social
order
of
spain
ought
to
be
overthrown
must
be
overthrown
will
be
overthrown
and
ferrer
was
doing
a
mighty
work
in
that
direction
the
men
who
killed
him
knew
and
understood
it
well
and
they
consciously
killed
him
for
what
he
really
did
but
they
have
let
the
outside
world
suppose
they
did
it
for
what
he
did
not
do
knowing
there
are
no
words
so
hated
by
all
governments
as
sedition
and
rebellion
knowing
that
such
words
will
make
the
most
radical
of
governments
align
itself
with
the
most
despotic
at
once
knowing
there
is
nothing
which
so
offends
the
majority
of
conservative
and
people
everywhere
as
the
idea
of
violence
unordered
by
authority
they
have
wilfully
created
the
impression
that
ferrer
schools
were
places
where
children
and
youths
were
taught
to
handle
weapons
and
to
make
ready
for
armed
attacks
on
the
government
they
have
as
i
said
before
created
this
impression
in
various
ways
they
have
pointed
to
the
fact
that
the
man
who
in
made
the
attack
on
alfonso
life
had
acted
as
a
translator
of
books
used
by
ferrer
in
his
schools
they
have
scattered
over
europe
and
america
pictures
purporting
to
be
reproductions
of
drawings
in
prominent
in
his
schools
recommending
the
violent
overthrow
of
the
government
as
to
the
first
of
these
accusations
i
shall
consider
it
later
in
the
lecture
but
as
to
the
last
it
should
be
enough
to
remind
any
person
with
an
ordinary
amount
of
reflection
that
the
schools
were
public
places
open
to
any
one
as
our
schools
are
and
that
if
any
such
pictures
had
existed
they
would
have
been
sufficient
cause
for
shutting
up
the
schools
and
incarcerating
the
founder
within
a
day
after
their
appearance
on
the
walls
the
spanish
government
has
that
much
sense
of
how
to
preserve
its
own
existence
that
it
would
not
allow
such
pictures
to
hang
in
a
public
place
for
one
day
nor
would
books
preaching
sedition
have
been
permitted
to
be
published
or
all
this
is
foolish
dust
sought
to
be
thrown
in
foolish
eyes
no
the
real
offense
was
the
real
thing
that
he
did
and
in
order
to
appreciate
its
enormity
from
the
spanish
ruling
force
standpoint
let
us
now
consider
what
that
ruling
force
is
what
are
the
economic
and
educational
conditions
of
the
spanish
people
why
and
how
ferrer
founded
the
modern
schools
and
what
were
the
subjects
taught
therein
up
to
the
year
there
existed
no
legal
provision
for
general
elementary
education
in
spain
in
that
year
owing
to
the
liberals
having
gotten
into
power
in
madrid
after
a
bitter
contest
aroused
partially
by
the
general
political
events
of
europe
a
law
making
elementary
education
compulsory
was
passed
this
was
two
years
before
ferrer
birth
now
it
is
one
thing
for
a
political
party
temporarily
in
possession
of
power
to
pass
a
law
it
is
quite
another
thing
to
make
that
law
effective
even
when
wealth
and
general
sentiment
are
behind
it
but
when
joined
to
the
fact
that
there
is
a
strong
opposition
is
added
the
fact
that
this
opposition
is
in
possession
of
the
greatest
wealth
of
the
country
that
the
people
to
be
benefited
are
often
quite
as
bitterly
opposed
to
their
own
enlightenment
as
those
who
profit
by
their
ignorance
and
that
those
who
do
ardently
desire
their
own
uplift
are
extremely
poor
the
difficulty
of
practicalizing
this
educational
law
is
partially
appreciated
ferrer
own
boyhood
life
is
an
illustration
of
how
much
benefit
the
children
of
the
peasantry
reaped
from
the
educational
law
his
parents
were
vine
dressers
they
were
eminently
orthodox
and
believed
what
their
priest
who
was
probably
the
only
man
in
the
little
village
of
alella
able
to
read
told
them
that
the
liberals
were
the
emissaries
of
satan
and
that
whatever
they
did
was
utterly
evil
they
wanted
no
such
evil
thing
as
popular
education
about
and
would
not
that
their
children
should
have
it
accordingly
even
at
years
of
age
the
boy
was
without
education
a
circumstance
which
in
after
years
made
him
more
anxious
that
others
should
not
suffer
as
he
had
it
is
that
if
it
was
difficult
to
found
schools
in
the
cities
where
there
existed
a
degree
of
popular
clamor
for
them
it
was
next
to
impossible
in
the
rural
districts
where
people
like
parents
were
the
typical
inhabitants
the
best
result
obtained
by
this
law
in
the
years
from
to
was
that
out
of
people
were
then
able
to
read
and
write
remaining
illiterate
at
the
end
of
the
proportion
was
altered
to
literate
out
of
population
which
may
be
considered
as
a
fairly
correct
approximate
of
the
present
condition
one
of
the
very
great
accounting
causes
for
this
situation
is
the
extreme
poverty
of
the
mass
of
the
populace
in
many
districts
of
spain
a
laborer
wages
are
less
than
a
week
and
nowhere
do
they
equal
the
poorest
workman
wages
in
america
of
course
it
is
understood
that
the
cost
of
living
is
likewise
low
but
imagine
it
as
low
as
you
please
it
is
still
evident
that
the
income
of
the
workers
is
too
small
to
permit
them
to
save
anything
even
from
the
most
frugal
living
the
dire
struggle
to
secure
food
clothing
and
shelter
is
such
that
little
energy
is
left
wherewith
to
aspire
to
anything
to
demand
anything
either
for
themselves
or
their
children
unless
therefore
the
government
provided
the
buildings
the
books
and
appliances
and
paid
the
teachers
salaries
it
is
easy
to
see
that
the
people
most
in
need
of
education
are
least
able
and
least
likely
to
provide
it
for
themselves
furthermore
the
government
itself
unless
it
can
tax
the
wealthier
classes
for
it
can
not
out
of
such
an
impoverished
source
wring
sufficient
means
to
provide
adequate
schools
and
school
equipments
now
the
wealthiest
classes
are
just
the
religious
orders
according
to
the
statement
of
monsignor
josé
valeda
de
gunjado
these
orders
own
of
the
money
of
the
country
and
of
the
wealth
in
property
these
orders
are
utterly
opposed
to
all
education
except
such
as
they
themselves
furnish
a
lamentable
travesty
on
learning
as
a
writer
who
has
investigated
these
conditions
personally
observes
in
reply
to
the
question
does
not
the
church
provide
numbers
of
schools
day
and
night
at
its
own
expense
it
does
unhappily
for
spain
it
provides
schools
whose
principal
aim
is
to
strengthen
superstition
follow
a
mediaeval
curriculum
scientific
light
and
prevent
other
and
better
schools
from
being
established
a
spanish
educational
journal
escuela
not
journal
declared
in
that
these
schools
were
largely
without
light
or
ventilation
dens
of
death
ignorance
and
bad
training
it
was
estimated
that
children
died
every
year
in
consequence
of
the
mischievous
character
of
the
school
rooms
and
even
to
schools
like
these
there
were
half
a
million
children
in
spain
who
could
gain
no
admittance
as
to
the
teachers
they
are
allowed
a
salary
ranging
from
to
a
year
but
this
is
provided
not
by
the
state
but
through
voluntary
donations
from
the
parents
so
that
a
teacher
in
addition
to
his
legitimate
functions
must
perform
those
of
collector
of
his
own
salary
now
conceive
that
he
is
endeavoring
to
collect
it
from
parents
whose
wages
amount
to
two
or
three
dollars
a
week
and
you
will
not
be
surprised
at
the
case
reported
by
a
madrid
paper
in
of
a
having
canvassed
a
district
to
find
how
many
parents
would
contribute
if
he
opened
a
school
out
of
one
hundred
families
three
promised
their
support
is
it
any
wonder
that
the
law
of
compulsory
education
is
a
mockery
how
could
it
be
anything
else
now
let
us
look
at
the
products
of
this
popular
ignorance
and
we
shall
presently
understand
why
the
church
fosters
it
why
it
fights
education
and
also
why
the
catalonian
insurrection
of
which
began
as
a
strike
of
workers
in
protest
against
the
moroccan
war
ended
in
mob
attacks
upon
convents
monasteries
and
churches
i
have
already
quoted
the
statement
of
a
high
spanish
prelate
that
the
religious
orders
of
spain
own
of
the
money
of
spain
and
of
the
wealth
in
property
whether
this
estimate
is
precisely
correct
or
not
it
is
sufficiently
near
correctness
to
make
us
aware
that
at
least
a
great
portion
of
the
wealth
of
the
country
has
passed
into
their
hands
a
state
not
widely
differing
from
that
existing
in
france
prior
to
the
great
revolution
before
the
insurrection
of
last
year
the
city
of
barcelona
alone
had
convents
many
of
which
were
exceedingly
rich
the
province
of
catalonia
maintained
of
these
institutions
aside
from
these
religious
orders
with
their
accumulations
of
wealth
the
church
itself
the
united
body
of
priests
not
in
orders
is
immensely
wealthy
conceive
that
in
the
cathedral
at
toledo
there
is
an
image
of
the
virgin
whose
wardrobe
alone
would
be
sufficient
to
build
hundreds
of
schools
imagine
that
this
doll
which
is
supposed
to
symbolize
the
forlorn
young
woman
who
in
her
pain
and
sorrow
and
need
was
driven
to
seek
shelter
in
a
stable
whose
life
was
ever
lowly
and
who
is
called
the
mother
of
sorrows
imagine
that
this
image
of
her
has
become
a
vulgar
coquette
sporting
a
robe
whereinto
are
sown
pearls
besides
as
many
more
sapphires
amethysts
and
diamonds
oh
what
a
decoration
for
the
mother
of
the
carpenter
of
nazareth
what
a
vision
for
the
dying
eyes
on
the
cross
to
look
forward
to
what
an
outcome
of
the
gospel
of
salvation
free
to
the
poor
and
lowly
taught
by
the
poorest
and
the
lowliest
that
the
humble
keeper
of
the
humble
household
of
the
despised
little
village
of
judea
should
be
imaged
forth
as
a
queen
of
gauds
bedizened
with
a
crown
worth
and
bracelets
valued
at
more
the
virgin
mary
the
daughter
of
the
stable
transformed
into
a
diamond
merchant
showcase
and
this
in
the
midst
of
men
and
women
working
for
just
enough
to
keep
the
skin
upon
the
bone
in
the
midst
of
children
who
are
denied
the
primary
necessities
of
childhood
now
i
ask
you
when
the
fury
of
these
people
burst
as
under
the
provocation
they
received
it
was
inevitable
that
it
should
burst
was
it
any
wonder
that
it
manifested
itself
in
mob
violence
against
the
institutions
which
mock
their
suffering
by
this
useless
senseless
criminal
waste
of
wealth
in
the
face
of
utter
need
will
some
one
now
whisper
in
our
ears
that
there
are
women
in
america
who
decorate
themselves
with
more
jewels
than
the
virgin
of
toledo
and
throw
away
the
price
of
a
school
on
a
useless
decoration
in
a
single
night
while
within
a
radius
of
five
miles
from
them
there
are
also
uneducated
children
for
whom
our
school
boards
can
provide
no
place
yes
it
is
so
let
them
remember
the
mobs
of
barcelona
and
let
me
remember
i
am
talking
about
spain
the
question
naturally
intrudes
how
does
the
church
how
do
the
religious
orders
manage
to
accumulate
such
wealth
remember
first
that
they
are
old
and
of
unbroken
continuance
for
hundreds
of
years
that
various
forms
of
acquisition
in
operation
for
centuries
would
produce
immense
accumulations
even
supposing
nothing
but
legitimate
purchases
and
gifts
but
when
we
consider
the
actual
means
whereby
money
is
daily
absorbed
from
the
people
by
these
institutions
we
receive
a
shock
which
sets
all
our
notions
of
the
triumph
of
modern
science
it
is
almost
impossible
to
realize
and
yet
it
is
true
that
the
spanish
church
still
deals
in
that
infamous
graft
against
which
martin
luther
hurled
the
splendid
force
of
his
wrath
four
hundred
years
ago
the
church
of
spain
still
sells
indulgences
every
catholic
bookstore
and
every
priest
has
them
for
sale
they
are
called
bulas
their
prices
range
from
about
to
cents
and
they
constitute
an
elastic
excuse
for
doing
pretty
much
what
the
possessor
pleases
to
do
providing
it
is
not
a
capital
crime
for
a
definitely
named
period
probably
there
is
no
one
in
america
so
little
able
to
believe
this
condition
to
exist
as
the
ordinary
roman
catholic
i
have
myself
listened
to
priests
of
the
roman
faith
giving
the
conditions
on
which
pardon
for
venal
offenses
might
be
obtained
and
they
had
nothing
to
do
with
money
they
consisted
in
saying
a
certain
number
of
prayers
at
stated
periods
with
specified
intent
while
that
may
be
a
very
illogical
way
of
putting
things
together
that
have
no
connection
there
is
nothing
in
it
to
offend
one
ideas
of
honesty
the
enlightened
conscience
of
an
entire
mass
of
people
has
demanded
that
a
spiritual
offense
be
dealt
with
by
spiritual
means
it
would
revolt
at
the
idea
that
such
grace
could
be
written
out
on
paper
and
sold
either
to
the
highest
bidder
or
for
a
fixed
price
but
now
conceive
what
happens
where
a
people
are
illiterate
regarding
written
documents
with
that
superstitious
awe
which
those
who
can
not
read
always
have
for
the
mysterious
language
of
learning
regarding
them
besides
with
the
combination
of
fear
and
reverence
which
the
ignorant
believer
entertains
for
the
visible
sign
of
supernatural
power
the
power
which
holds
over
him
the
threat
of
eternal
punishment
and
you
will
have
what
goes
on
in
spain
add
to
this
that
such
a
condition
of
fear
and
gullibility
on
the
side
of
the
people
is
the
great
opportunity
of
the
religious
grafter
whatever
number
of
honest
devoted
people
may
be
attracted
to
the
service
of
the
church
there
will
certainly
be
found
also
the
cheat
the
impostor
the
searcher
for
ease
and
power
these
indulgences
which
for
or
cents
pardon
the
buyer
for
his
past
sins
but
are
good
only
till
he
sins
again
constitute
a
species
of
permission
to
do
what
otherwise
is
forbidden
the
most
expensive
one
the
is
practically
a
license
to
hold
stolen
property
up
to
a
certain
amount
both
rich
and
poor
buy
these
things
the
rich
of
course
paying
a
good
deal
more
than
the
stipulated
sum
but
it
hardly
requires
the
statement
that
an
immense
number
of
the
very
poor
buy
them
also
and
from
this
horrible
traffic
the
church
of
spain
annually
draws
millions
there
are
other
sources
of
income
such
as
the
sale
of
scapulars
charms
and
other
pieces
of
trumpery
which
goes
on
all
over
the
catholic
world
also
but
naturally
to
no
such
extent
as
in
spain
portugal
and
italy
where
popular
ignorance
may
be
again
measured
by
the
materialism
of
its
religion
now
is
it
reasonable
to
suppose
that
the
individuals
who
are
thriving
upon
these
sales
want
a
condition
of
popular
enlightenment
do
they
not
know
how
all
this
traffic
would
crumble
like
the
ash
of
a
fire
once
the
blaze
of
science
were
to
flame
through
spain
educate
yes
they
educate
the
people
to
believe
in
these
barbaric
relics
of
a
dead
time
their
own
material
spain
and
portugal
are
the
last
resort
of
the
mediaeval
church
the
monasticism
and
the
jesuitry
which
have
been
expelled
from
other
european
countries
and
compelled
to
withdraw
from
cuba
and
the
philippines
have
concentrated
there
and
there
they
are
making
their
last
fight
there
they
will
go
down
into
their
eternal
grave
but
not
till
science
has
invaded
the
dark
corners
of
the
popular
intellect
the
political
condition
is
parallel
with
the
religious
condition
of
the
people
with
the
exception
that
the
state
is
poor
while
the
church
is
rich
there
are
some
elements
in
the
government
which
are
opposed
to
the
church
religiously
which
nevertheless
do
not
wish
to
see
its
power
as
an
institution
upset
because
they
foresee
that
the
same
people
who
would
overthrow
the
church
would
later
overthrow
them
these
too
wish
to
see
the
people
kept
ignorant
nevertheless
there
have
been
numerous
political
rebellions
in
spain
having
for
their
object
the
establishment
of
a
republic
in
there
occurred
such
a
rebellion
under
the
leadership
of
ruiz
zorilla
at
that
time
ferrer
was
not
quite
years
old
he
had
acquired
an
education
by
his
own
efforts
he
was
a
declared
republican
as
it
seems
that
every
young
ardent
youth
seeing
what
the
condition
of
his
country
was
and
wishing
for
its
betterment
would
be
zorilla
was
for
a
short
time
minister
of
public
instruction
under
the
new
government
and
very
zealous
for
popular
education
naturally
he
became
an
object
of
admiration
and
imitation
to
ferrer
in
the
early
eighties
after
various
fluctuations
of
political
power
zorilla
who
had
been
absent
from
spain
returned
to
it
and
began
the
labor
of
converting
the
soldiers
to
republicanism
ferrer
was
then
a
director
of
railways
and
of
much
service
to
zorilla
in
the
practical
work
of
organization
in
this
movement
culminated
in
an
abortive
revolution
wherein
both
ferrer
and
zorilla
took
active
part
and
were
accordingly
compelled
to
take
refuge
in
france
upon
the
failure
of
the
insurrection
it
is
therefore
certain
that
from
his
entrance
into
public
agitation
till
the
year
ferrer
was
an
active
revolutionary
republican
believing
in
the
overthrow
of
spanish
tyranny
by
violence
there
is
no
question
that
at
that
time
he
said
and
wrote
things
which
whether
we
shall
consider
them
justifiable
or
not
were
openly
in
favor
of
forcible
rebellion
such
utterances
charged
against
him
at
the
alleged
trial
in
which
were
really
his
were
quotations
from
this
period
remember
he
was
then
years
old
when
the
trial
occurred
he
was
years
old
what
had
been
his
mental
evolution
during
those
years
in
paris
where
with
the
exception
of
a
short
intermission
in
when
he
visited
spain
he
remained
for
about
fifteen
years
he
naturally
drifted
into
a
method
of
making
a
living
quite
common
to
educated
exiles
in
a
foreign
land
giving
private
lessons
in
his
native
language
but
while
this
is
with
most
a
mere
temporary
makeshift
which
they
change
for
something
else
as
soon
as
they
are
able
to
ferrer
it
revealed
what
his
real
business
in
life
should
be
he
found
teaching
to
be
his
genuine
vocation
so
much
so
that
he
took
part
in
several
movements
for
popular
education
in
paris
giving
much
free
service
this
participation
in
the
labor
of
training
the
mind
which
is
always
a
slow
and
patient
matter
began
to
have
its
effect
on
his
conceptions
of
political
change
slowly
the
idea
of
a
spain
regenerated
through
the
storm
blasts
of
revolution
mightily
and
suddenly
faded
out
of
his
belief
being
replaced
probably
almost
insensibly
by
the
idea
that
a
thorough
educational
enlightenment
must
precede
political
transformation
if
that
transformation
were
to
be
permanent
this
conviction
he
voiced
with
strange
power
and
beauty
of
expression
when
he
said
to
his
old
revolutionary
republican
friend
alfred
naquet
time
respects
those
works
alone
which
time
itself
has
helped
to
build
naquet
himself
old
and
sinking
man
as
he
is
is
at
this
day
and
hour
heart
and
soul
for
forcible
revolution
admitting
all
the
evils
which
it
engenders
and
all
the
dangers
of
miscarriage
which
accompany
it
he
still
believes
to
quote
his
own
words
that
revolutions
are
not
only
the
marvelous
accoucheurs
of
societies
they
are
also
fecundating
forces
they
fructify
men
intelligences
and
if
they
determine
the
final
realization
of
matured
evolutions
they
also
become
through
their
action
on
human
minds
points
of
departure
for
newer
evolutions
yet
he
who
thus
sings
the
paean
of
the
uprisen
people
with
a
fire
of
youth
and
an
ardor
of
love
that
sound
like
the
singing
of
some
strong
young
blacksmith
marching
at
the
head
of
an
insurgent
column
rather
than
the
quavering
voice
of
an
old
spent
man
he
who
was
the
warm
personal
friend
of
ferrer
for
many
years
and
who
would
surely
have
wished
that
his
ideal
love
should
also
have
been
his
friend
love
he
expressly
declares
that
ferrer
was
of
those
who
feel
themselves
drawn
to
the
field
of
preparative
labor
making
sure
the
ground
over
which
the
revolution
may
march
to
enduring
results
this
then
was
the
ripened
condition
of
his
mind
especially
after
the
death
of
zorilla
and
all
his
subsequent
life
and
labor
is
explicable
only
with
this
understanding
of
his
mental
attitude
in
the
confusion
of
deafening
voices
it
has
been
declared
that
not
only
did
he
not
take
part
in
last
year
manifestations
nor
instigate
them
but
that
he
in
fact
had
become
a
tolstoyan
a
this
is
not
true
he
undoubtedly
understood
that
the
introduction
of
popular
education
into
spain
means
revolt
sooner
or
later
and
he
would
certainly
have
been
glad
to
see
a
successful
revolt
overthrow
the
monarchy
at
madrid
he
did
not
wish
the
people
to
be
submissive
it
is
one
of
the
fundamental
teachings
of
the
schools
he
founded
that
the
assertive
spirit
of
the
child
is
to
be
encouraged
that
its
will
is
not
to
be
broken
that
the
sin
of
other
schools
is
the
forcing
of
obedience
he
hoped
to
help
to
form
a
young
spain
which
would
not
submit
which
would
resist
resist
consciously
intelligently
steadily
he
did
not
wish
to
enlighten
people
merely
to
render
them
more
sensitive
to
their
pains
and
deprivations
but
that
they
might
so
use
their
enlightenment
as
to
rid
themselves
of
the
system
of
exploitation
by
church
and
state
which
is
responsible
for
their
miseries
by
what
means
they
would
choose
to
free
themselves
he
did
not
make
his
affair
how
and
when
were
these
schools
founded
it
was
during
his
long
sojourn
in
paris
that
he
had
as
a
private
pupil
in
spanish
a
wealthy
unmarried
catholic
lady
after
much
conflict
over
religion
between
teacher
and
pupil
the
latter
modified
her
orthodoxy
greatly
and
especially
after
her
journeys
to
spain
where
she
herself
saw
the
condition
of
public
instruction
eventually
she
became
interested
in
ferrer
conceptions
of
education
and
his
desire
to
establish
schools
in
his
own
country
and
when
she
died
in
she
was
then
somewhat
over
years
old
she
devised
a
certain
part
of
her
property
to
ferrer
to
be
used
as
he
saw
fit
feeling
assured
no
doubt
that
he
would
see
fit
to
use
it
not
for
his
personal
advantage
but
for
the
purpose
so
dear
to
his
heart
which
he
did
the
bequest
amounted
to
about
and
the
first
expenditure
was
for
the
establishment
of
the
modern
school
of
barcelona
in
the
year
it
should
be
said
that
this
was
not
the
first
of
the
modern
school
movement
in
spain
for
previous
to
that
and
for
several
years
there
had
sprung
up
in
various
parts
of
the
country
a
spontaneous
movement
towards
a
very
heroic
effort
in
a
way
considering
that
the
teachers
were
generally
workingmen
who
had
spent
their
day
in
the
shops
and
were
using
the
remainder
of
their
exhausted
strength
to
enlighten
their
and
the
children
these
were
largely
as
there
were
no
means
behind
these
efforts
the
buildings
in
which
they
were
held
were
of
course
unsuitable
there
was
no
proper
plan
of
work
no
sufficient
equipment
and
little
of
labor
a
considerable
percentage
of
these
schools
were
already
on
the
decline
when
ferrer
equipped
with
his
splendid
organizing
ability
his
teacher
experience
and
mlle
endowment
opened
the
barcelona
school
having
as
pupils
eighteen
boys
and
twelve
girls
so
proper
to
the
demand
was
this
effort
that
at
the
end
of
four
earnest
activity
fifty
schools
had
been
established
ten
in
barcelona
and
forty
in
the
provinces
in
that
is
after
five
years
work
a
banquet
was
held
on
good
friday
at
which
pupils
were
present
from
to
that
is
something
and
a
banquet
in
catholic
spain
on
good
friday
a
banquet
of
children
who
have
bade
to
the
salvation
of
the
soul
by
the
punishment
of
the
stomach
we
here
may
laugh
but
in
spain
it
was
a
triumph
and
a
menace
which
both
sides
understood
i
have
said
that
ferrer
brought
to
his
work
splendid
organizing
ability
this
he
speedily
put
to
purpose
by
enlisting
the
of
a
number
of
the
greatest
scientists
of
europe
in
the
preparation
of
embodying
the
discoveries
of
science
couched
in
language
comprehensible
to
young
minds
so
far
i
am
sorry
to
say
i
have
not
succeeded
in
getting
copies
of
these
manuals
the
spanish
government
confiscated
most
of
them
and
has
probably
destroyed
them
still
there
are
some
uncaptured
sets
one
is
already
in
the
british
museum
and
i
make
no
doubt
that
within
a
year
or
so
we
shall
have
translations
of
most
of
them
there
were
thirty
of
these
manuals
all
told
comprising
the
work
of
the
three
sections
primary
intermediate
and
superior
into
which
the
pupils
were
divided
from
what
i
have
been
able
to
find
out
about
these
books
i
believe
the
most
interesting
of
them
all
would
be
the
first
reading
book
it
was
prepared
by
odon
de
buen
and
is
said
to
be
at
the
same
time
a
speller
a
grammar
and
an
illustrated
manual
of
evolution
the
majestic
story
of
the
evolution
of
the
cosmos
from
the
atom
to
the
thinking
being
related
in
a
language
simple
comprehensible
to
the
child
copies
of
this
book
were
rapidly
sold
imagine
what
that
meant
to
catholic
schools
that
the
babies
of
spain
should
learn
nothing
about
eternal
punishment
for
their
deadly
sins
and
learn
that
they
are
one
in
a
long
line
of
unfolding
life
that
started
in
the
lowly
the
books
on
geography
physics
and
minerology
were
written
in
like
manner
and
with
like
intent
by
the
same
author
on
anthropology
enguerrand
wrote
and
on
evolution
letourneau
of
paris
among
the
very
suggestive
works
was
one
on
the
universal
substance
a
collaborate
production
of
albert
bloch
and
paraf
javal
in
which
the
mysteries
of
existence
are
resolved
into
their
chemical
equivalents
so
that
the
foundations
for
magic
and
miracle
are
unceremoniously
cleared
out
of
the
intellectual
field
this
book
was
prepared
at
ferrer
special
request
as
an
antidote
to
ancestral
leanings
inherited
superstitions
the
various
outside
influences
counteracting
the
influences
of
the
school
the
methods
of
instruction
were
modeled
after
earlier
attempts
in
france
and
were
based
on
the
general
idea
that
physical
and
intellectual
education
must
continually
supplement
each
other
that
no
one
is
really
educated
so
long
as
his
knowledge
is
merely
the
recollection
of
what
he
has
read
or
seen
in
a
book
accordingly
a
lesson
often
consisted
of
a
visit
to
a
factory
a
workshop
a
studio
or
a
laboratory
where
things
were
explained
and
illustrated
or
in
a
class
journey
to
the
hills
or
the
sea
or
the
open
country
where
the
geological
or
topographical
conditions
were
studied
or
botanical
specimens
collected
and
individual
observation
encouraged
very
often
even
book
classes
were
held
out
of
doors
and
the
children
insensibly
put
in
touch
with
the
great
pervading
influences
of
nature
a
touch
too
often
lost
or
never
felt
at
all
in
our
city
environments
how
different
was
all
this
from
the
incomprehensible
theology
of
the
catholic
schools
to
be
learned
and
believed
but
not
understood
the
impractical
rehearsing
of
strings
of
words
characteristic
of
mediaeval
survivals
no
wonder
the
modern
schools
grew
and
grew
and
the
hatred
of
the
priests
waxed
hotter
and
hotter
their
opportunity
came
indeed
they
did
not
wait
long
in
the
year
on
the
day
of
may
not
so
very
long
after
that
good
friday
banquet
occurred
the
event
which
they
seized
upon
to
crush
the
modern
school
and
its
founder
i
am
not
here
to
speak
either
for
or
against
mateo
morral
he
was
a
wealthy
young
man
of
much
energy
and
considerable
learning
he
had
helped
to
enrich
the
library
of
the
modern
school
and
being
an
excellent
linguist
he
had
offered
to
make
translations
of
ferrer
had
accepted
the
offer
that
is
all
morral
had
to
do
with
the
modern
school
but
on
the
day
of
royal
festivities
morral
had
it
in
his
head
to
throw
a
bomb
where
it
would
do
some
royal
hurt
he
missed
his
calculations
and
the
hurt
intended
did
not
take
place
but
after
a
short
interval
finding
himself
about
to
be
captured
he
killed
himself
think
of
him
as
you
please
think
that
he
was
a
madman
who
did
a
madman
act
think
that
he
was
a
generous
enthusiast
who
in
an
outburst
of
long
chafing
indignation
at
his
country
condition
wanted
to
strike
a
blow
at
a
tyrannical
monarchy
and
was
willing
to
give
his
own
life
in
exchange
for
the
tyrant
or
better
than
this
reserve
your
judgment
and
say
that
you
know
not
the
man
nor
his
personal
condition
nor
the
special
external
conditions
that
prompted
him
and
that
without
such
knowledge
he
can
not
be
judged
but
whatever
you
think
of
morral
pray
why
was
ferrer
arrested
and
the
modern
school
of
barcelona
closed
why
was
he
thrown
in
prison
and
kept
there
for
more
than
a
year
why
was
it
sought
to
railroad
him
before
a
court
martial
and
that
attempt
failing
the
civil
trial
postponed
for
all
that
time
why
because
ferrer
taught
science
to
the
children
of
spain
and
for
no
other
thing
his
enemies
would
have
killed
him
then
but
having
been
compelled
to
yield
an
open
trial
by
the
outcry
of
europe
they
were
also
compelled
to
release
him
but
i
imagine
i
hear
yea
hear
the
resolute
mutter
behind
the
closed
walls
of
the
monasteries
the
day
ferrer
went
free
go
then
we
shall
get
you
again
and
then
and
then
they
would
do
what
three
years
later
they
did
him
to
the
ditch
yea
they
shut
their
lips
together
like
the
thin
lips
of
fate
and
waited
the
hatred
of
an
order
has
something
superb
in
it
it
hates
so
relentlessly
so
constantly
so
transcendently
its
personnel
changes
its
hate
never
alters
it
wears
one
priest
face
or
another
itself
is
identical
inexorable
it
pursues
to
the
end
did
ferrer
know
this
undoubtedly
in
a
general
way
he
did
and
yet
he
was
so
far
from
conceiving
its
appalling
remorselessness
that
even
when
he
found
himself
in
prison
again
and
utterly
in
their
power
he
could
not
believe
that
he
would
not
be
freed
what
was
this
opportunity
for
which
the
jesuitry
of
spain
waited
with
such
terrible
security
the
catalonian
uprising
how
did
they
know
it
would
come
as
any
sane
man
not
knows
that
uprising
must
come
in
spain
ferrer
hoped
to
sap
away
the
foundations
of
tyranny
through
peaceful
enlightenment
he
was
right
but
they
are
also
right
who
say
that
there
are
other
forces
hurling
towards
those
foundations
the
greatest
of
these
now
it
was
plain
and
simple
starvation
that
rose
to
rend
its
starvers
when
the
catalonian
women
rose
in
mobs
to
cry
against
the
command
that
was
taking
away
their
fathers
and
sons
to
their
death
in
morocco
the
spanish
people
did
not
want
the
moroccan
war
the
government
in
the
interest
of
a
number
of
capitalists
did
but
like
all
governments
and
all
capitalists
it
wanted
workingmen
to
do
the
dying
and
they
did
not
want
to
die
and
leave
their
wives
and
children
to
die
too
so
they
rebelled
at
first
it
was
the
conscious
orderly
protest
of
organized
workingmen
but
starvation
no
more
respects
the
commands
of
unions
than
the
commands
of
governments
and
other
orderly
bodies
it
has
nothing
to
lose
and
it
gets
away
in
its
fury
from
all
management
and
it
riots
where
churches
and
monasteries
are
offensively
rich
and
at
ease
in
the
face
of
hunger
hunger
takes
its
revenge
it
has
long
fangs
it
rends
and
tears
and
tramples
the
innocent
with
the
guilty
always
it
is
very
horrible
but
remember
remember
how
much
more
horrible
is
the
long
slow
systematic
crushing
wasting
drying
of
men
upon
their
bones
which
year
after
year
century
after
century
has
begotten
the
monster
hunger
remember
the
innocent
children
annually
slaughtered
the
blinded
and
the
crippled
children
maimed
and
forsaken
by
social
power
and
behind
the
smoke
and
flame
of
the
burning
convents
of
july
see
the
staring
of
those
sightless
eyes
ferrer
instigate
that
mad
frenzy
oh
no
it
was
a
mightier
than
ferrer
our
lady
of
pain
our
lady
of
hunger
our
lady
with
uncut
nails
and
teeth
our
lady
who
bears
the
in
her
body
that
cannon
are
to
tear
our
lady
the
workingwoman
of
spain
ahungered
she
incarnated
the
red
terror
and
the
enemies
of
ferrer
in
as
in
knew
that
such
things
would
come
and
they
bided
their
time
it
is
one
of
those
pathetic
things
which
destiny
deals
that
it
was
only
for
love
sake
and
most
for
the
love
of
a
little
child
who
died
moreover
that
the
uprising
found
ferrer
in
spain
at
all
he
had
been
in
england
investigating
schools
and
methods
there
from
april
until
the
middle
of
june
word
came
that
his
and
his
niece
were
ill
so
the
of
june
found
him
at
the
little
girl
bedside
he
intended
soon
after
to
go
to
paris
but
delayed
to
make
some
inquiries
for
a
friend
concerning
the
proceedings
of
the
electrical
society
of
barcelona
so
the
storm
caught
him
as
it
caught
thousands
of
others
he
went
about
the
business
of
his
publishing
house
as
usual
making
the
observations
of
an
interested
spectator
of
events
to
his
friend
naquet
he
sent
a
postal
card
on
the
of
july
in
which
he
spoke
of
the
heroism
of
the
women
the
lack
of
in
the
movements
and
the
total
absence
of
leaders
as
a
curious
phenomenon
hearing
soon
after
that
he
was
to
be
arrested
he
secluded
himself
for
five
weeks
the
white
terror
was
in
full
sway
men
women
and
children
had
been
arrested
incarcerated
inhumanly
treated
then
the
chief
prosecutor
issued
the
statement
that
ferrer
was
the
director
of
the
revolutionary
movement
too
indignant
to
listen
to
the
appeals
of
his
friends
he
started
to
barcelona
to
give
himself
up
and
demand
trial
he
was
arrested
on
the
way
and
they
him
the
proceedings
were
utterly
infamous
no
chance
to
confront
witnesses
against
him
no
opportunity
to
bring
witnesses
not
even
the
books
accused
of
sedition
allowed
to
offer
their
mute
testimony
in
their
own
defense
no
opportunity
given
to
his
defender
to
prepare
letters
sent
from
england
and
france
to
prove
what
had
been
the
doomed
man
purposes
and
occupations
during
his
stay
there
lost
in
transit
the
old
articles
of
years
before
made
to
appear
as
if
recent
utterances
forgeries
imposed
and
with
all
this
nothing
but
hearsay
evidence
even
from
his
accusers
and
yet
he
was
sentenced
to
death
sentenced
to
death
and
shot
and
all
modern
schools
closed
and
his
property
sequestrated
and
the
virgin
of
toledo
may
wear
her
gorgeous
robes
in
peace
since
the
shadow
of
the
darkness
has
stolen
back
over
the
circle
of
light
he
lit
only
somewhere
somewhere
down
in
the
obscurity
hovers
the
menacing
figure
of
her
rival
our
lady
of
pain
she
is
still
now
but
she
is
not
dead
and
if
all
things
be
taken
from
her
and
the
light
not
allowed
to
come
to
her
nor
to
her
children
then
some
day
she
will
set
her
own
lights
in
the
darkness
ferrer
ferrer
is
with
the
immortals
his
work
is
spreading
over
the
world
it
will
yet
return
and
rid
spain
of
its
tyrants
modern
educational
reform
questions
of
genuine
importance
to
large
masses
of
people
are
not
posed
by
a
single
questioner
nor
even
by
a
limited
number
they
are
put
with
more
or
less
precision
with
more
or
less
consciousness
of
their
scope
and
demand
by
all
classes
involved
this
is
a
fair
test
of
its
being
a
genuine
question
rather
than
a
temporary
fad
such
is
the
test
we
are
to
apply
to
the
present
inquiry
what
is
wrong
with
our
present
method
of
child
education
what
is
to
be
done
in
the
way
of
altering
or
abolishing
it
the
posing
of
the
question
acquired
a
sudden
prominence
through
the
execution
of
a
great
educator
for
alleged
complicity
in
the
revolutionary
events
of
spain
during
the
moroccan
war
people
were
not
satisfied
with
the
spanish
government
declarations
as
to
this
official
murder
they
were
not
convinced
that
they
were
being
told
the
truth
they
inquired
why
the
government
should
be
so
anxious
for
that
man
death
and
they
learned
that
as
a
teacher
he
had
founded
schools
wherein
ideas
hostile
to
governmental
programs
for
learning
were
put
in
practice
and
they
have
gone
on
asking
to
know
what
these
ideas
were
how
they
were
taught
and
how
can
those
same
ideas
be
applied
to
the
practical
questions
of
education
confronting
them
in
the
persons
of
their
own
children
but
it
would
be
a
very
great
mistake
to
suppose
that
the
question
was
raised
out
of
nothingness
or
out
of
the
brilliancy
of
his
own
mind
by
francisco
ferrer
if
it
were
if
he
were
the
creator
of
the
question
instead
of
the
response
to
it
his
martyr
death
could
have
given
it
but
an
ephemeral
prominence
which
would
speedily
have
subsided
on
the
contrary
the
inquiry
stimulated
by
that
tragic
death
was
but
the
first
loud
articulation
of
what
has
been
asked
in
thousands
of
millions
of
homes
all
over
the
civilized
world
it
has
been
put
by
each
of
the
three
classes
concerned
each
in
its
own
peculiar
way
from
its
own
peculiar
viewpoint
by
the
educator
by
the
parent
and
by
the
child
itself
there
is
a
fourth
personage
who
has
had
a
great
deal
to
say
and
still
has
but
to
my
mind
he
is
a
to
be
eliminated
as
speedily
as
possible
i
mean
the
statesman
he
considers
himself
profoundly
important
as
representing
the
interests
of
society
in
general
he
is
anxious
for
the
formation
of
good
citizens
to
support
the
state
and
directs
education
in
such
channels
as
he
thinks
will
produce
these
i
prefer
to
leave
the
discussion
of
his
peculiar
functions
for
a
later
part
of
this
address
here
observing
only
that
if
he
is
a
legitimate
factor
if
by
chance
he
is
a
genuine
educator
strayed
into
statesmanship
a
statesman
he
is
interested
only
from
a
secondary
motive
he
is
not
interested
in
the
actual
work
of
schools
in
the
children
as
persons
but
in
the
producing
of
a
certain
type
of
character
to
serve
certain
subsequent
ends
the
criticism
offered
by
the
child
itself
upon
the
prevailing
system
of
instruction
is
the
most
simple
direct
and
at
the
same
time
the
critic
is
utterly
unconscious
of
its
force
who
has
not
heard
a
child
say
in
that
fretted
whine
characteristic
of
a
creature
who
knows
its
protest
will
be
ineffective
but
what
do
i
have
to
learn
that
for
oh
i
do
see
what
i
have
to
know
that
for
i
ca
remember
it
anyway
i
hate
to
go
to
school
i
just
as
lief
take
a
whipping
my
teacher
a
mean
old
thing
she
expects
you
to
sit
quiet
the
whole
morning
and
if
you
just
make
the
least
little
noise
she
keeps
you
in
at
recess
why
do
we
have
to
keep
still
so
long
what
good
does
it
do
i
remember
well
the
remark
made
to
me
once
by
one
of
my
teachers
and
a
very
good
teacher
too
who
nevertheless
did
not
see
what
her
own
observation
ought
to
have
suggested
she
said
regard
teachers
as
their
natural
enemies
the
thought
which
it
would
have
been
logical
to
suppose
would
have
followed
this
observation
is
that
if
children
in
general
are
possessed
of
that
notion
it
is
because
there
is
a
great
deal
in
the
teacher
treatment
of
them
which
runs
counter
to
the
child
nature
that
possibly
this
is
so
not
because
of
natural
cussedness
on
the
part
of
the
child
but
because
of
inapplicability
of
the
knowledge
taught
or
the
manner
of
teaching
it
or
both
to
the
mental
and
physical
needs
of
the
child
i
am
quite
sure
no
such
thought
entered
my
teacher
mind
at
least
regarding
the
system
of
knowledge
to
be
imposed
being
a
sensible
woman
she
perhaps
occasionally
admitted
to
herself
that
she
might
make
mistakes
in
applying
the
rules
but
that
the
body
of
knowledge
to
be
taught
was
indispensable
and
must
somehow
be
injected
into
children
heads
under
threat
of
punishment
if
necessary
i
am
sure
she
never
questioned
it
did
not
occur
to
her
any
more
than
to
most
teachers
that
the
first
business
of
an
educator
should
be
to
find
out
what
are
the
needs
aptitudes
and
tendencies
of
children
before
he
or
she
attempts
to
outline
a
body
of
knowledge
to
be
taught
or
rules
for
teaching
it
it
does
not
occur
to
them
that
the
child
question
what
do
i
have
to
learn
that
for
is
a
perfectly
legitimate
question
and
if
the
teacher
can
not
answer
it
to
the
child
satisfaction
something
is
wrong
either
with
the
thing
taught
or
with
the
teaching
either
the
thing
taught
is
out
of
rapport
with
the
child
age
or
his
natural
tendencies
or
his
condition
of
development
or
the
method
by
which
it
is
taught
repels
him
disgusts
him
or
at
best
fails
to
interest
him
when
a
child
says
i
do
see
why
i
have
to
know
that
i
remember
it
anyway
he
is
voicing
a
very
reasonable
protest
of
course
there
are
plenty
of
instances
of
wilful
shirking
where
a
little
effort
can
overcome
the
slackness
of
memory
but
every
teacher
who
is
honest
enough
to
reckon
with
himself
knows
he
can
not
give
a
sensible
reason
why
things
are
to
be
taught
which
have
so
little
to
do
with
the
child
life
that
or
the
day
after
examination
they
will
be
forgotten
things
which
he
himself
could
not
remember
were
he
not
repeating
them
year
in
and
year
out
as
a
matter
of
his
trade
and
every
teacher
who
has
thought
at
all
for
himself
about
the
essential
nature
of
the
young
humanity
he
is
dealing
with
knows
that
six
hours
of
daily
herding
and
of
young
active
bodies
and
limbs
accompanied
by
the
additional
injunction
that
no
feet
are
to
be
shuffled
no
whispers
exchanged
and
no
paper
wads
thrown
is
a
frightful
violation
of
all
the
laws
of
young
life
any
gardener
who
should
attempt
to
raise
healthy
beautiful
and
fruitful
plants
by
outraging
all
those
instinctive
wants
and
searchings
would
meet
as
his
reward
sickly
plants
ugly
plants
sterile
plants
dead
plants
he
will
not
do
it
he
will
watch
very
carefully
to
see
whether
they
like
much
sunlight
or
considerable
shade
whether
they
thrive
on
much
water
or
get
drowned
in
it
whether
they
like
sandy
soil
or
fat
mucky
soil
the
plant
itself
will
indicate
to
him
when
he
is
doing
the
right
thing
and
every
gardener
will
watch
for
indications
with
great
anxiety
if
he
finds
the
plant
revolts
against
his
experiments
he
will
desist
at
once
and
try
something
else
if
he
finds
it
thrives
he
will
emphasize
the
particular
treatment
so
long
as
it
seems
beneficial
but
what
he
will
surely
not
do
will
be
to
prepare
a
certain
area
of
ground
all
just
alike
with
equal
chances
of
sun
and
amount
of
moisture
in
every
part
and
then
plant
everything
together
without
discrimination
mighty
close
together
saying
beforehand
if
plants
do
want
to
thrive
on
this
they
ought
to
want
to
and
if
they
are
stubborn
about
it
they
must
be
made
to
or
if
a
raiser
of
animals
were
to
start
in
feeding
them
on
a
regimen
adapted
not
to
their
tastes
but
to
his
if
he
were
to
insist
on
stuffing
the
young
ones
with
food
only
fitted
for
the
older
ones
if
he
were
to
shut
them
up
and
compel
them
somehow
to
be
silent
stiff
and
motionless
for
hours
together
he
would
well
he
would
very
likely
be
arrested
for
cruelty
to
animals
of
course
there
is
this
difference
between
the
grower
of
plants
or
animals
and
the
grower
of
children
the
former
is
dealing
with
his
subject
as
a
superior
power
with
a
force
which
will
always
remain
subject
to
his
while
the
latter
is
dealing
with
a
force
which
is
bound
to
become
his
equal
and
taking
it
in
the
long
and
large
sense
bound
ultimately
to
supersede
him
the
fear
of
the
footfalls
of
the
young
generation
is
in
his
ears
whether
he
is
aware
of
it
or
not
and
he
instinctively
does
what
every
living
thing
seeks
to
do
to
preserve
his
power
since
he
can
not
remain
forever
the
superior
the
dictator
he
endeavors
to
put
a
definite
mould
upon
that
power
which
he
must
share
to
have
the
child
learn
what
he
has
learned
as
he
has
learned
it
and
to
the
same
end
that
he
has
learned
it
the
grower
of
flowers
or
fruits
or
vegetables
or
the
raiser
of
animals
secure
in
his
forever
indisputable
superiority
has
nothing
to
fear
when
he
inquires
into
the
ways
of
his
subjects
he
will
never
think
but
if
i
heed
such
and
such
manifestation
of
the
flower
or
the
animal
desire
or
repulsion
it
will
develop
certain
tendencies
as
a
result
which
will
eventually
overturn
me
and
mine
and
all
that
i
believe
in
and
labor
to
preserve
the
grower
of
children
is
perpetually
beset
by
this
fear
he
must
not
listen
to
a
child
complaint
against
the
school
it
breaks
down
the
mutual
relation
of
authority
and
obedience
it
destroys
the
faith
of
the
child
that
his
olders
know
better
than
he
it
sets
up
little
centers
of
future
rebellion
in
the
brain
of
every
child
affected
by
the
example
no
complaint
as
to
the
wisdom
of
the
system
must
be
discouraged
ignored
frowned
down
crushed
by
superior
dignity
if
necessary
punished
the
very
best
answer
a
child
ever
gets
to
its
legitimate
inquiry
why
do
i
have
to
learn
such
and
such
a
thing
is
wait
till
you
get
older
and
you
will
understand
it
all
just
now
you
are
a
little
too
young
to
understand
the
reasons
in
cases
out
of
a
hundred
the
answerer
got
the
same
reply
to
his
own
question
twenty
years
before
and
he
has
never
found
out
since
either
do
as
we
tell
you
to
now
say
the
teachers
and
be
sure
that
we
are
instructing
you
for
your
good
the
explanations
will
become
clear
to
you
some
time
and
the
child
smothers
his
complaint
cramps
his
poor
little
body
to
the
best
of
his
ability
and
continues
to
repeat
definitions
which
mean
nothing
to
him
but
strings
of
long
words
and
rules
which
to
him
are
simply
torture
apparatus
invented
by
his
natural
enemies
to
plague
i
recall
quite
distinctly
the
bitter
resentment
i
felt
toward
the
inverted
divisor
the
formula
was
easy
enough
to
remember
invert
the
terms
of
the
divisor
and
proceed
as
in
multiplication
of
fractions
i
memorized
it
in
less
than
a
minute
and
followed
the
prescription
and
got
my
examples
correct
but
oh
how
how
was
the
miracle
accomplished
why
should
a
fraction
be
made
to
stand
on
its
head
and
how
did
that
change
a
division
suddenly
into
a
multiplication
and
i
never
found
out
till
i
undertook
to
teach
some
one
else
years
afterward
yet
the
thing
could
have
been
made
plain
then
perhaps
would
have
been
but
for
the
fact
that
as
a
respectful
pupil
i
was
so
trained
to
think
that
my
methods
must
not
be
questioned
or
their
explanations
reflected
upon
that
i
sat
mute
mystified
puzzled
and
silently
indignant
in
the
end
i
swallowed
it
as
i
did
a
lot
of
other
knowledge
and
consented
to
use
its
miraculous
nature
very
much
as
my
christian
friends
use
the
body
and
blood
of
christ
to
wash
their
sins
away
without
very
well
understanding
the
modus
operandi
another
advantage
which
the
botanical
or
zoölogical
cultivator
has
over
the
by
which
incidentally
the
plants
and
animals
profit
is
that
since
he
is
not
seeking
to
produce
a
universal
type
but
rather
to
develop
as
many
new
and
interesting
types
as
he
can
he
is
very
studious
to
notice
the
inclinations
of
his
subjects
observing
possible
beginnings
of
differentiation
and
adapting
his
treatment
to
the
development
of
such
beginnings
of
course
he
also
does
what
no
could
possibly
do
he
ruthlessly
destroys
weaklings
and
as
the
superior
intermeddling
divinity
he
fosters
those
special
types
which
are
more
serviceable
to
himself
irrespective
of
whether
they
are
more
serviceable
to
plant
or
animal
life
apart
from
man
but
is
the
fact
that
children
are
of
the
same
race
as
ourselves
the
fact
that
their
development
should
be
regarded
from
the
point
of
how
best
shall
they
serve
themselves
their
own
race
and
generation
not
that
of
a
discriminating
overlord
assuming
the
power
of
life
and
death
over
them
a
reason
for
us
to
disregard
their
tendencies
aptitudes
likes
and
dislikes
altogether
a
reason
for
us
to
treat
their
natural
manifestations
of
to
our
methods
of
treatment
with
less
consideration
than
we
give
to
a
fern
or
a
hare
i
should
on
the
contrary
suppose
it
was
a
reason
to
consider
them
all
the
more
i
think
the
difficulty
lies
in
the
immeasurable
vanity
of
the
human
adult
particularly
the
pedagogical
adult
i
presume
i
may
say
it
with
less
offense
since
i
am
a
teacher
myself
which
does
not
permit
him
to
recognize
as
good
any
tendency
in
children
to
fly
in
the
face
of
his
conceptions
of
a
correct
human
being
to
recognize
that
may
be
here
is
something
highly
desirable
to
be
encouraged
rather
than
destroyed
as
pernicious
a
does
expect
to
make
another
voter
or
householder
out
of
his
fern
so
he
lets
it
show
what
it
wants
to
be
without
being
at
all
horrified
at
anything
it
does
but
your
teacher
has
usually
conceptions
of
what
men
and
women
have
to
be
and
if
a
boy
is
too
lively
too
noisy
too
restless
too
curious
to
suit
the
concept
he
must
be
trimmed
and
subdued
and
if
he
is
lazy
he
has
to
be
spurred
with
all
sorts
of
whips
which
are
offensive
both
to
the
handler
and
the
handled
the
weapons
of
shaming
and
arousing
the
spirit
of
rivalry
are
two
which
are
much
used
the
former
with
sometimes
fatal
results
as
in
the
case
of
the
nine
year
old
boy
who
recently
committed
suicide
because
his
teacher
drew
attention
to
his
torn
coat
or
young
girls
who
have
worried
themselves
into
fevers
from
a
scornful
word
respecting
their
failures
in
scholarship
and
arousing
rivalry
brings
an
evil
train
behind
it
of
spites
and
jealousies
i
do
not
say
as
some
enthusiasts
do
there
are
no
bad
children
or
there
are
no
lazy
children
but
i
am
quite
sure
that
both
badness
and
laziness
often
result
from
lack
of
understanding
and
lack
of
adaptation
and
that
these
can
only
be
attained
by
teachers
comprehending
that
they
must
seek
to
understand
as
well
as
to
be
understood
badness
is
sometimes
only
dammed
up
energy
which
can
no
more
help
flooding
over
than
dammed
up
water
laziness
is
often
the
result
of
forcing
a
child
to
a
task
for
which
it
has
no
natural
liking
while
it
would
be
energetic
enough
given
the
thing
it
liked
to
do
at
any
rate
it
is
worth
while
to
try
to
find
out
what
is
the
matter
in
the
spirit
of
a
searcher
after
truth
which
is
the
first
point
i
want
to
establish
that
the
general
complaints
of
children
are
true
criticisms
of
the
school
system
and
superintendents
of
public
instruction
boards
of
education
and
teachers
have
as
their
first
duty
to
heed
and
consider
these
complaints
let
us
now
consider
the
complaints
of
parents
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
parents
of
young
children
particularly
their
mothers
and
especially
these
latter
when
they
are
the
wives
of
workingmen
with
families
regard
the
school
rather
as
a
convenience
for
getting
rid
of
the
children
during
a
certain
period
of
the
day
than
anything
else
they
are
not
to
be
blamed
for
this
they
have
obeyed
the
imperative
mandate
of
nature
in
having
families
with
no
very
adequate
conception
of
what
they
were
doing
they
find
themselves
burdened
with
responsibilities
often
greatly
beyond
their
capacity
they
have
all
they
can
do
sometimes
more
than
they
can
do
to
manage
the
financial
end
of
things
to
see
to
their
children
material
wants
and
to
get
through
the
work
of
a
house
very
often
they
are
themselves
deficient
in
even
the
elementary
knowledge
of
the
schools
they
feel
that
their
children
need
to
know
a
great
deal
that
they
have
never
known
but
they
are
utterly
without
the
ability
to
say
whether
what
they
learn
is
useful
and
important
or
not
with
the
helplessness
of
ignorance
towards
wisdom
they
receive
the
system
provided
by
the
state
on
trust
presuming
it
is
good
and
with
the
pardonable
relief
of
busy
and
overburdened
people
they
look
at
the
clock
as
school
hour
approaches
and
breathe
a
sigh
of
relief
when
the
last
child
is
out
of
the
house
they
would
be
shocked
at
the
idea
that
they
regard
their
children
as
nuisances
they
would
vigorously
defend
themselves
by
saying
that
they
feel
that
the
children
are
in
better
hands
than
their
own
safe
and
well
treated
but
before
long
even
these
ignorant
ones
observe
that
their
children
have
learned
a
number
of
things
which
are
not
good
they
have
mixed
with
a
crowd
of
others
and
somewhere
among
them
they
have
learned
bad
language
bad
ideas
and
bad
habits
these
are
complaints
which
may
be
heard
from
intelligent
educated
and
conservative
parents
also
parents
who
may
be
presumed
to
be
satisfied
with
the
spirit
and
general
purpose
of
the
knowledge
imparted
in
the
also
the
children
suffer
in
health
through
their
schools
and
later
on
when
the
cramming
and
crowding
of
their
brains
goes
on
in
earnest
as
it
does
in
the
higher
grades
and
particularly
the
high
schools
oh
then
springs
up
a
terrible
crop
of
headache
nervous
prostration
hysterics
anaemia
especially
among
the
girls
and
a
harvest
of
other
physical
disorders
which
were
very
probably
planted
back
in
the
primary
departments
and
fostered
in
the
higher
rooms
the
students
are
so
overtrained
that
they
often
become
good
for
nothing
in
the
house
the
parents
say
and
too
late
the
mothers
discover
that
they
themselves
become
servants
to
the
whimsical
little
ladies
and
gentlemen
they
have
raised
up
who
are
more
interested
in
than
in
practical
household
matters
such
are
the
ordinary
complaints
heard
on
every
side
uttered
by
those
who
really
have
no
fault
to
find
with
the
substance
of
the
instruction
itself
some
because
they
do
not
know
and
some
because
it
fairly
represents
their
own
ideas
the
complaint
becomes
much
more
vital
and
definite
when
it
proceeds
from
a
parent
who
is
an
informed
person
with
a
conception
of
life
at
variance
with
that
commonly
accepted
i
will
instance
that
of
a
philadelphia
physician
who
recently
said
to
me
in
my
opinion
many
of
the
most
horrid
effects
of
malformations
which
i
have
to
deal
with
are
the
results
of
the
long
hours
of
sitting
imposed
on
children
in
the
schools
it
is
impossible
for
a
healthy
active
creature
to
sit
stiffly
straight
so
many
hours
no
one
can
do
it
they
will
inevitably
twist
and
squirm
themselves
down
into
one
position
or
another
which
throws
the
internal
organs
out
of
position
and
which
by
iteration
and
reiteration
results
in
a
continuously
accentuating
deformity
motherhood
often
becomes
extremely
painful
and
dangerous
through
the
narrowing
of
the
pelvis
produced
in
early
years
of
so
much
uncomfortable
sitting
i
believe
that
the
sort
of
schooling
which
necessitates
it
should
not
begin
till
a
child
is
fourteen
years
of
age
he
added
also
that
the
substance
of
our
education
should
be
such
as
would
fit
the
person
for
the
conditions
and
responsibilities
he
or
she
may
reasonably
be
expected
to
encounter
in
life
since
the
majority
of
boys
and
girls
will
most
likely
become
fathers
and
mothers
in
the
future
why
does
not
our
system
of
education
take
account
of
it
and
instruct
the
children
not
in
the
latin
names
of
bones
and
muscles
so
much
as
in
the
practical
functioning
and
hygiene
of
the
body
every
teacher
knows
and
most
of
our
parents
know
that
no
subject
is
more
carefully
ignored
by
our
on
physiology
than
the
reproductive
system
a
like
book
on
zoölogy
has
far
more
to
say
about
the
reproduction
of
animals
than
is
thought
fit
to
be
said
by
human
beings
to
human
beings
about
themselves
and
yet
upon
such
ignorance
often
depends
the
ruin
of
lives
such
is
the
criticism
of
an
intelligent
physician
himself
the
father
of
five
children
it
is
a
typical
complaint
of
those
who
have
to
deal
with
the
physical
results
of
our
school
system
a
still
more
forcible
complaint
is
rising
up
from
a
class
of
parents
who
object
not
only
negatively
but
positively
to
the
instruction
of
the
schools
these
are
saying
i
do
not
want
to
have
my
children
taught
things
which
are
positively
untrue
nor
truths
which
have
been
distorted
to
fit
some
one
political
or
religious
conception
i
do
not
want
any
sort
of
religion
or
politics
to
be
put
into
his
head
i
want
the
accepted
facts
of
natural
science
and
discovery
to
be
taught
him
in
so
far
as
they
are
within
the
grasp
of
his
intellect
i
do
not
want
them
colored
with
the
prejudice
of
any
system
i
want
a
school
system
which
will
be
suited
to
his
physical
i
want
what
he
learns
to
become
his
by
virtue
of
its
appealing
to
his
taste
his
aptitude
for
experiment
and
proof
i
do
not
want
it
to
be
a
foreign
stream
pouring
over
his
lips
like
a
brook
over
its
bed
leaving
nothing
behind
i
do
not
want
him
to
be
tortured
with
formal
examinations
nor
worried
by
credit
marks
with
averages
and
per
cents
and
tenths
of
per
cents
which
haunt
him
waking
and
sleeping
as
if
they
were
the
object
of
his
efforts
and
more
than
that
and
above
all
i
do
not
want
him
made
an
automaton
i
do
not
want
him
to
become
abjectly
obedient
i
do
not
want
his
free
initiative
destroyed
i
want
him
by
virtue
of
his
education
to
be
bodily
and
mentally
to
face
life
and
its
problems
this
is
my
second
point
that
parents
conservatives
and
radicals
criticise
the
school
as
the
producer
of
unhealthy
bodies
as
teaching
matter
inappropriate
to
life
or
rather
perhaps
as
not
teaching
what
is
appropriate
to
life
as
perverting
truth
to
serve
a
political
and
religious
system
and
as
putting
an
iron
mould
upon
the
will
of
youth
destroying
all
spontaneity
and
freedom
of
expression
the
third
critic
is
the
teacher
owing
to
his
peculiarly
dependent
position
it
is
very
very
seldom
that
any
really
vital
criticism
comes
out
of
the
mouth
of
an
ordinary
employé
in
the
public
school
service
first
if
he
has
any
subversive
ideas
he
dares
not
voice
them
for
fear
of
his
job
second
it
is
extremely
unlikely
that
any
one
with
subversive
ideas
either
will
apply
for
the
job
or
having
applied
will
get
it
and
third
if
through
some
fortuitous
combination
of
circumstances
a
rebellious
personage
has
smuggled
himself
into
the
camp
with
the
naive
notion
that
he
is
going
to
work
reforms
in
the
system
he
finds
before
long
that
the
system
is
rather
remoulding
him
he
falls
into
the
routine
prescribed
and
before
long
ceases
to
struggle
against
it
still
however
conservative
and
teachers
may
be
they
will
all
agree
upon
one
criticism
that
they
have
too
much
to
do
that
it
is
utterly
impossible
for
them
to
do
justice
to
every
pupil
that
with
from
thirty
to
fifty
pupils
all
depending
upon
one
teacher
for
instruction
it
is
out
of
the
question
to
give
any
single
one
sufficient
attention
to
say
nothing
of
any
special
attention
which
his
peculiar
backwardness
might
require
he
could
do
so
only
at
the
expense
of
injustice
to
the
rest
and
indeed
the
best
teacher
in
the
world
could
not
attend
properly
to
the
mental
needs
of
fifty
children
nor
even
of
thirty
furthermore
this
overcrowding
makes
necessary
the
stiff
regulation
the
formal
discipline
in
the
maintenance
of
which
so
much
of
the
teacher
energy
is
wasted
the
everlasting
the
record
of
tardiness
and
absence
the
eye
forever
on
the
watch
to
see
who
is
whispering
the
ear
forever
on
the
alert
to
catch
the
scraper
of
feet
the
mischievous
disturber
the
irrepressible
noisemaker
with
such
a
divided
and
subdivided
attention
how
is
it
possible
to
teach
here
and
there
we
find
a
teacher
with
original
ideas
not
of
subjects
to
be
taught
but
of
the
means
of
teaching
sometimes
there
is
one
who
inwardly
revolts
at
what
he
has
to
teach
and
takes
such
means
as
he
can
to
counteract
the
glorifications
of
political
aggrandizement
with
which
our
geographies
and
histories
are
redolent
in
general
however
public
school
teachers
like
government
clerks
believe
very
much
in
the
system
whereby
they
live
what
they
do
find
fault
with
and
what
they
have
very
much
reason
to
find
fault
with
is
not
the
school
system
but
the
counteracting
influences
of
bad
homes
teachers
are
often
heard
to
say
that
they
think
they
could
do
far
better
with
the
children
if
they
had
entire
control
of
them
or
as
they
more
commonly
express
themselves
if
only
their
parents
had
some
common
sense
lessons
of
order
neatness
cleanliness
and
hygiene
are
often
entirely
thrown
away
because
the
children
regard
them
as
statements
to
be
memorized
not
things
to
be
practised
those
children
whose
mothers
know
nothing
of
ventilation
the
necessity
for
exercise
the
chemistry
of
food
and
the
functioning
of
the
organs
of
the
body
will
forget
instructions
because
they
are
never
made
part
of
their
lives
which
criticism
is
a
sort
of
confirmation
of
that
sage
observation
if
you
want
to
reform
a
man
begin
with
his
grandmother
so
much
for
criticism
what
now
can
we
offer
in
the
way
of
suggestions
for
reform
speaking
abstractly
i
should
say
that
the
purpose
of
education
should
be
to
furnish
a
child
with
such
fundamental
knowledge
and
habits
as
will
preserve
and
strengthen
his
body
and
make
him
a
social
being
having
an
acquaintance
with
the
life
which
is
to
surround
him
and
an
adaptability
to
circumstances
which
will
render
him
able
to
meet
varying
conditions
but
we
are
immediately
confronted
by
certain
practical
queries
when
we
attempt
to
conceive
such
a
school
system
the
fact
is
that
the
training
of
the
body
should
be
begun
in
very
early
childhood
and
can
never
be
rightly
done
in
a
city
no
other
animal
than
man
ever
conceived
such
a
frightful
apparatus
for
depriving
its
young
of
the
primary
rights
of
physical
existence
as
the
human
city
the
mass
of
our
city
children
know
very
little
of
nature
what
they
have
learned
of
it
through
occasional
picnics
excursions
visits
in
the
country
they
have
learned
as
a
foreign
thing
having
little
relation
to
themselves
their
natural
habitat
is
one
of
lifeless
brick
and
mortar
wire
and
iron
poles
pavements
and
noise
yet
all
this
ought
to
be
utterly
foreign
to
children
ought
to
be
the
thing
visited
once
in
a
while
not
lived
in
there
is
no
pure
air
in
a
city
it
is
poisoned
yet
the
first
necessity
of
lunged
animals
especially
little
ones
is
pure
air
moreover
every
child
ought
to
know
the
names
and
ways
of
life
of
the
things
it
eats
how
to
grow
them
etc
how
are
gardens
possible
in
a
city
every
child
should
know
trees
not
as
things
he
has
read
about
but
as
familiar
presences
in
his
life
which
he
recognizes
as
quickly
as
his
eyes
greet
them
he
should
know
his
oneness
with
nature
not
through
the
medium
of
a
theory
but
through
feeling
it
daily
and
hourly
he
should
know
the
birds
by
their
songs
and
by
the
quick
glimpse
of
them
among
the
foliage
the
insect
in
its
home
the
wild
flower
on
its
stalk
the
fruit
where
it
hangs
can
this
be
done
in
a
city
it
is
the
city
that
is
wrong
and
its
creations
can
never
be
right
they
may
be
improved
they
can
never
be
what
they
should
let
me
quote
luther
burbank
here
he
expressed
so
well
and
just
in
the
tumultuous
disorder
and
dear
to
a
child
soul
the
early
rights
of
children
every
child
should
have
grasshoppers
tadpoles
frogs
elderberries
wild
strawberries
acorns
chestnuts
trees
to
climb
brooks
to
wade
in
woodchucks
bats
bees
butterflies
various
animals
to
pet
rocks
to
roll
sand
snakes
huckleberries
and
hornets
and
any
child
who
has
been
deprived
of
these
has
been
deprived
of
the
best
part
of
his
education
he
is
of
opinion
that
until
ten
years
of
age
these
things
should
be
the
real
educators
of
children
not
books
i
agree
with
him
but
neither
city
homes
nor
city
schools
can
give
children
these
things
furthermore
i
believe
that
education
should
be
integral
that
the
true
school
must
combine
physical
and
intellectual
education
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
but
i
am
confronted
by
the
fact
that
this
is
impossible
to
the
mass
of
the
people
because
of
the
economic
condition
in
which
we
are
all
floundering
what
is
possible
can
be
only
a
compromise
physical
education
will
go
on
in
the
home
principally
and
intellectual
education
in
the
school
something
might
be
done
to
organize
the
teaching
of
parents
lectures
and
demonstrations
at
the
public
schools
might
be
given
weekly
in
the
evenings
for
parents
by
competent
nurses
or
hygienists
but
they
would
remain
largely
ineffective
until
the
whole
atrocious
system
of
herding
working
people
in
cities
by
way
of
making
them
serviceable
cogwheels
in
the
capitalistic
machine
for
grinding
out
rent
and
profit
comes
to
an
end
the
physical
education
of
children
will
remain
at
best
a
pathetic
compromise
we
have
left
to
consider
what
may
be
done
in
the
way
of
improving
intellectual
education
what
is
really
necessary
for
a
child
to
know
which
he
is
not
taught
now
and
what
is
taught
that
is
unnecessary
as
to
reading
and
writing
there
is
no
dispute
though
there
is
much
dispute
about
the
way
of
doing
it
but
beyond
that
children
should
know
from
their
earlier
school
days
they
should
know
the
geography
of
their
own
locality
not
rehearsing
it
from
a
book
but
by
going
over
the
ground
having
the
relations
of
places
explained
to
them
and
by
being
shown
how
to
model
relief
maps
themselves
they
should
know
the
indications
of
the
weather
being
taught
the
use
of
instruments
for
measuring
temperatures
amount
of
sunshine
etc
they
should
know
the
special
geology
of
their
own
locality
the
nature
of
the
soil
and
its
products
through
practical
exhibition
they
should
be
allowed
to
construct
from
clay
stone
or
brick
such
little
buildings
as
they
usually
like
to
make
and
from
them
the
simple
principles
of
geometry
taught
you
see
every
school
needs
a
big
yard
and
with
tools
in
them
the
use
of
which
tools
they
should
be
taught
arithmetic
to
be
sure
they
need
to
know
but
arithmetic
connected
with
things
let
them
learn
fractions
by
cutting
up
things
and
putting
them
together
and
not
be
bothered
by
abstractions
running
into
the
hundreds
of
thousands
the
millions
which
never
in
time
will
they
use
and
drop
all
that
tiresome
years
work
in
interest
and
per
cent
if
decimals
are
understood
every
one
who
has
need
will
be
amply
able
to
work
out
systems
of
interest
when
necessary
children
should
know
the
industrial
life
through
which
they
live
into
which
they
are
probably
going
they
should
see
how
cloth
is
woven
thread
is
spun
shoes
are
made
iron
forged
and
wrought
again
not
alone
by
written
description
but
by
they
should
as
they
grow
older
learn
the
history
of
the
arts
of
peace
what
they
do
not
need
to
know
is
so
much
of
the
details
of
the
history
of
destruction
the
general
facts
and
results
of
wars
are
sufficient
they
do
not
need
to
be
impressed
with
the
details
of
killings
which
they
sensibly
forget
and
inevitably
also
moreover
the
revolting
patriotism
which
is
being
inculcated
whereby
children
learn
to
be
proud
of
their
country
not
for
its
contributions
to
the
general
enlightenment
of
humanity
but
for
its
crimes
against
humanity
whereby
they
are
taught
to
consider
themselves
their
country
their
flag
their
institutions
as
things
to
be
upheld
and
maintained
right
or
wrong
whereby
the
stupid
and
criminal
life
of
the
soldier
is
exalted
as
honorable
should
be
wholly
omitted
from
the
educational
system
however
it
is
utterly
impossible
to
expect
that
it
will
be
by
anything
short
of
general
public
sentiment
against
it
and
at
present
such
sentiment
is
for
it
i
have
alluded
before
to
the
function
of
the
statesman
in
directing
education
so
long
as
schools
are
maintained
by
governments
the
statesman
not
the
true
educator
will
determine
what
sort
of
history
is
to
be
taught
and
it
will
be
what
it
is
now
only
continually
growing
worse
political
institutions
must
justify
themselves
to
the
young
generation
they
begin
by
training
childish
minds
to
believe
that
what
they
do
is
to
be
accepted
not
criticised
a
history
becomes
little
better
than
a
catechism
of
patriotic
formulas
in
glorification
of
the
state
now
there
is
no
way
of
escaping
this
for
those
who
disapprove
it
short
of
eliminating
the
statesman
establishing
voluntarily
supported
schools
wherein
wholly
different
notions
shall
be
taught
in
which
the
spirit
of
teaching
history
shall
be
one
of
honest
statement
and
fearless
criticism
wherein
the
true
image
of
war
and
the
army
and
all
that
it
means
shall
be
honestly
given
the
really
ideal
school
which
would
not
be
a
compromise
would
be
a
boarding
school
built
in
the
country
having
a
farm
attached
and
workshops
where
useful
crafts
might
be
learned
in
daily
connection
with
intellectual
training
it
presupposes
teachers
able
to
train
little
children
to
habits
of
health
order
and
neatness
in
the
utmost
detail
and
yet
not
tyrants
or
rigid
disciplinarians
in
free
contact
with
nature
the
children
would
learn
to
use
their
limbs
as
nature
meant
feel
their
intimate
relationship
with
the
growing
life
of
other
sorts
form
a
profound
respect
for
work
and
an
estimate
of
the
value
of
it
wish
to
become
real
doers
in
the
world
and
not
mere
gatherers
in
of
other
men
products
and
with
the
respect
for
work
the
appreciation
of
work
the
desire
to
work
will
come
the
pride
of
the
true
workman
who
will
know
how
to
maintain
his
dignity
and
the
dignity
of
what
he
does
at
present
the
major
portion
of
our
working
people
are
sorry
they
are
working
people
as
they
have
good
reason
to
be
they
take
little
joy
or
pride
in
what
they
do
they
consider
themselves
as
less
gifted
and
less
valuable
persons
in
society
than
those
who
have
amassed
wealth
and
by
virtue
of
that
amassment
live
upon
their
employees
or
those
who
by
attaining
book
knowledge
have
gotten
out
of
the
field
of
manual
production
and
lead
an
easier
life
they
educate
their
children
in
the
hope
that
these
at
least
may
attain
that
easier
existence
without
work
which
has
been
beyond
them
even
when
such
parents
themselves
have
dreams
of
a
reorganization
of
society
wherein
all
shall
labor
and
all
have
leisure
due
they
impress
upon
the
children
that
no
one
should
be
a
common
workingman
if
he
can
help
it
workingmen
are
slaves
and
it
is
not
well
to
be
a
slave
our
radicals
fail
to
realize
that
to
accomplish
the
reorganization
of
work
it
is
necessary
to
have
and
workers
with
the
free
spirit
the
rebellious
spirit
which
will
consider
its
own
worth
and
refuse
to
accept
the
slavish
conditions
of
capitalism
these
must
be
bred
in
schools
where
work
is
done
and
done
proudly
and
in
full
consciousness
of
its
value
where
the
dubious
services
of
the
capitalist
will
likewise
be
rated
at
their
true
worth
and
no
man
reckoned
as
above
another
unless
he
has
done
a
greater
social
service
where
political
institutions
and
the
politicians
who
operate
them
judges
lawmakers
or
executives
will
be
candidly
criticised
and
repudiated
when
justice
dictates
so
whether
in
the
teaching
of
their
past
history
or
their
present
actions
in
current
events
whether
the
workers
upon
whom
so
many
drains
are
already
made
will
be
able
to
establish
and
maintain
such
schools
is
a
question
to
be
solved
upon
trial
through
their
organizations
the
question
is
will
you
breed
men
for
the
service
of
the
cannon
to
be
aimed
at
you
in
the
hour
of
strikes
and
revolts
men
to
uphold
the
machine
which
is
crushing
you
or
will
you
train
them
in
the
knowledge
of
the
true
worth
of
labor
and
a
determination
to
reorganize
it
as
it
should
be
sex

night

four

a

an

whose

have
soaked
up

of
so
many

murdered
as

when
murder
now
is
stalking
in

when
dens

are

thick
within
your

that
competition
has
forced
down
the
price
of
prostitution
to
the
level
of

sit

the

has
become

great

play
away
your

when
debauchees
of
the
worst
type
hold
all
your

and
dine
off

who
support

why
then
sits
moses
harman
there
within
his
prison
cell
if
he
is
so
a
criminal
why
is
he
not
with
the
rest
of
the
spawn
of
crime
dining
at
delmonico
or
enjoying
a
trip
to
europe
if
he
is
so
bad
a
man
why
in
the
name
of
wonder
did
he
ever
get
in
the
penitentiary
ah
no
it
is
not
because
he
has
done
any
evil
thing
but
because
he
a
pure
enthusiast
searching
searching
always
for
the
cause
of
misery
of
the
kind
which
he
loved
with
that
broad
love
of
which
only
the
pure
soul
is
capable
searched
for
the
data
of
evil
and
searching
so
he
found
the
vestibule
of
life
to
be
a
prison
cell
the
holiest
and
purest
part
of
the
temple
of
the
body
if
indeed
one
part
can
be
holier
or
purer
than
another
the
altar
where
the
most
devotional
love
in
truth
should
be
laid
he
found
this
altar
ravished
despoiled
trampled
upon
he
found
little
babies
helpless
voiceless
little
things
generated
in
lust
cursed
with
impure
moral
natures
cursed
prenatally
with
the
germs
of
disease
forced
into
the
world
to
struggle
and
to
suffer
to
hate
themselves
to
hate
their
mothers
for
bearing
them
to
hate
society
and
to
be
hated
by
it
in
return
a
bane
upon
self
and
race
draining
the
lees
of
crime
and
he
said
this
felon
with
the
stripes
upon
his
body
let
the
mothers
of
the
race
go
free
let
the
little
children
be
pure
love
children
born
of
the
mutual
desire
for
parentage
let
the
manacles
be
broken
from
the
shackled
slave
that
no
more
slaves
be
born
no
more
tyrants
conceived
he
looked
this
obscenist
looked
with
clear
eyes
into
this
thing
you
call
morality
sealed
with
the
seal
of
marriage
and
saw
in
it
the
consummation
of
impurity
and
injustice
he
beheld
every
married
woman
what
she
is
a
bonded
slave
who
takes
her
name
her
master
bread
her
master
commands
and
serves
her
passion
who
passes
through
the
ordeal
of
pregnancy
and
the
throes
of
travail
at
dictation
not
at
her
desire
who
can
control
no
property
not
even
her
own
body
without
his
consent
and
from
whose
straining
arms
the
children
she
bears
may
be
torn
at
his
pleasure
or
willed
away
while
they
are
yet
unborn
it
is
said
the
english
language
has
a
sweeter
word
than
any
other
but
moses
harman
looked
beneath
the
word
and
saw
the
fact
a
prison
more
horrible
than
that
where
he
is
sitting
now
whose
corridors
radiate
over
all
the
earth
and
with
so
many
cells
that
none
may
count
them
yes
our
masters
the
earth
is
a
prison
the
is
a
cell
women
are
the
prisoners
and
you
are
the
keepers
he
saw
this
corruptionist
how
in
those
cells
are
perpetrated
such
outrages
as
are
enough
to
make
the
cold
sweat
stand
upon
the
forehead
and
the
nails
clench
and
the
teeth
set
and
the
lips
grow
white
in
agony
and
hatred
and
he
saw
too
how
from
those
cells
might
none
come
forth
to
break
her
fetters
how
no
slave
dare
cry
out
how
all
these
murders
are
done
quietly
beneath
the
of
home
and
sanctified
by
the
angelic
benediction
of
a
piece
of
paper
within
the
of
a
marriage
certificate
adultery
and
rape
stalk
freely
and
at
ease
yes
for
that
is
adultery
where
woman
submits
herself
sexually
to
man
without
desire
on
her
part
for
the
sake
of
keeping
him
virtuous
keeping
him
at
home
the
women
say
well
if
a
man
did
not
love
me
and
respect
himself
enough
to
be
virtuous
without
prostituting
me
he
might
go
and
welcome
he
has
no
virtue
to
keep
and
that
is
rape
where
a
man
forces
himself
sexually
upon
a
woman
whether
he
is
licensed
by
the
marriage
law
to
do
it
or
not
and
that
is
the
vilest
of
all
tyranny
where
a
man
compels
the
woman
he
says
he
loves
to
endure
the
agony
of
bearing
children
that
she
does
not
want
and
for
whom
as
is
the
rule
rather
than
the
exception
they
can
not
properly
provide
it
is
worse
than
any
other
human
oppression
it
is
fairly
to
the
sexual
tyrant
there
is
no
parallel
upon
earth
one
must
go
to
the
skies
to
find
a
fiend
who
thrusts
life
upon
his
children
only
to
starve
and
curse
and
outcast
and
damn
them
and
only
through
the
marriage
law
is
such
tyranny
possible
the
man
who
deceives
a
woman
outside
of
marriage
and
mind
you
such
a
man
will
deceive
marriage
too
may
deny
his
own
child
if
he
is
mean
enough
he
can
not
tear
it
from
her
arms
he
can
not
touch
it
the
girl
he
wronged
thanks
to
your
very
pure
and
tender
may
die
in
the
street
for
want
of
food
can
not
force
his
hated
presence
upon
her
again
but
his
wife
gentlemen
his
wife
the
woman
he
respects
so
much
that
he
consents
to
let
her
merge
her
individuality
into
his
lose
her
identity
and
become
his
chattel
his
wife
he
may
not
only
force
unwelcome
children
upon
outrage
at
his
own
good
pleasure
and
keep
as
a
general
cheap
and
convenient
piece
of
furniture
but
if
she
does
not
get
a
divorce
and
she
can
not
for
such
cause
he
can
follow
her
wherever
she
goes
come
into
her
house
eat
her
food
force
her
into
the
cell
her
by
virtue
of
his
sexual
authority
and
she
has
no
redress
unless
he
is
indiscreet
enough
to
abuse
her
in
some
less
brutal
but
unlicensed
manner
i
know
a
case
in
your
city
where
a
woman
was
followed
so
for
ten
years
by
her
husband
i
believe
he
finally
developed
grace
enough
to
die
please
applaud
him
for
the
only
decent
thing
he
ever
did
oh
is
it
not
rare
all
this
talk
about
the
preservation
of
morality
by
marriage
law
o
splendid
carefulness
to
preserve
that
which
you
have
not
got
o
height
and
depth
of
purity
which
fears
so
much
that
the
children
will
not
know
who
their
fathers
are
because
forsooth
they
must
rely
upon
their
mother
word
instead
of
the
hired
certification
of
some
priest
of
the
church
or
the
law
i
wonder
if
the
children
would
be
improved
to
know
what
their
fathers
have
done
i
would
rather
much
rather
not
know
who
my
father
was
than
know
he
had
been
a
tyrant
to
my
mother
i
would
rather
much
rather
be
illegitimate
according
to
the
statutes
of
men
than
illegitimate
according
to
the
unchanging
law
of
nature
for
what
is
it
to
be
legitimate
born
according
to
law
it
is
to
be
nine
cases
out
of
ten
the
child
of
a
man
who
acknowledges
his
fatherhood
simply
because
he
is
forced
to
do
so
and
whose
conception
of
virtue
is
realized
by
the
statement
that
a
woman
duty
is
to
keep
her
husband
at
home
to
be
the
child
of
a
woman
who
cares
more
for
the
benediction
of
grundy
than
the
simple
honor
of
her
lover
word
and
conceives
prostitution
to
be
purity
and
duty
when
exacted
of
her
by
her
husband
it
is
to
have
tyranny
as
your
progenitor
and
slavery
as
your
prenatal
cradle
it
is
to
run
the
risk
of
unwelcome
birth
legal
constitutional
weakness
morals
corrupted
before
birth
possibly
a
murder
instinct
the
inheritance
of
excessive
sexuality
or
no
sexuality
either
of
which
is
disease
it
is
to
have
the
value
of
a
piece
of
paper
a
rag
from
the
tattered
garments
of
the
social
contract
set
above
health
beauty
talent
or
goodness
for
i
never
yet
had
difficulty
in
obtaining
the
admission
that
illegitimate
children
are
nearly
always
prettier
and
brighter
than
others
even
from
conservative
women
and
how
supremely
disgusting
it
is
to
see
them
look
from
their
own
puny
sickly
children
upon
whom
lie
the
of
their
own
terrible
servitude
look
from
these
to
some
healthy
beautiful
natural
child
and
say
what
a
pity
its
was
virtuous
never
a
word
about
children
fathers
virtue
they
know
too
much
virtue
disease
stupidity
criminality
what
an
thing
virtue
is
what
is
it
to
be
illegitimate
to
be
despised
or
pitied
by
those
whose
spite
or
whose
pity
is
worth
the
breath
it
takes
to
return
it
to
be
possibly
the
child
of
some
man
contemptible
enough
to
deceive
a
woman
the
child
of
some
woman
whose
chief
crime
was
belief
in
the
man
she
loved
to
be
free
from
the
prenatal
curse
of
a
slave
mother
to
come
into
the
world
without
the
permission
of
any
set
of
tyrants
who
assume
to
corner
the
earth
and
say
what
terms
the
unborn
must
make
for
the
privilege
of
coming
into
existence
this
is
legitimacy
and
illegitimacy
choose
the
man
who
walks
to
and
fro
in
his
cell
in
lansing
penitentiary
this
vicious
man
said
the
mothers
of
the
race
are
lifting
their
dumb
eyes
to
me
their
sealed
lips
to
me
their
agonizing
hearts
to
me
they
are
seeking
seeking
for
a
voice
the
unborn
in
their
helplessness
are
pleading
from
their
prisons
pleading
for
a
voice
the
criminals
with
the
unseen
ban
upon
their
souls
that
has
pushed
them
pushed
them
to
the
vortex
out
of
their
whirling
hells
are
looking
waiting
for
a
voice
will
be
their
i
will
unmask
the
outrages
of
the
i
will
make
known
how
criminals
are
born
i
will
make
one
outcry
that
shall
be
heard
and
let
what
will
be
he
cried
out
through
the
letter
of
markland
that
a
young
mother
lacerated
by
unskilful
surgery
in
the
birth
of
her
babe
but
recovering
from
a
subsequent
successful
operation
had
been
stabbed
remorselessly
cruelly
brutally
stabbed
not
with
a
knife
but
with
the
procreative
organ
of
her
husband
stabbed
to
the
doors
of
death
and
yet
there
was
no
redress
and
because
he
called
a
spade
a
spade
because
he
named
that
organ
by
its
own
name
so
given
in
webster
dictionary
and
in
every
medical
journal
in
the
country
because
of
this
moses
harman
walks
to
and
fro
in
his
cell
he
gave
a
concrete
example
of
the
effect
of
sex
slavery
and
for
it
he
is
imprisoned
it
remains
for
us
now
to
carry
on
the
battle
and
lift
the
standard
where
they
struck
him
down
to
scatter
broadcast
the
knowledge
of
this
crime
of
society
against
a
man
and
the
reason
for
it
to
inquire
into
this
vast
system
of
licensed
crime
its
cause
and
its
effect
broadly
upon
the
race
the
cause
let
woman
ask
herself
why
am
i
the
slave
of
man
why
is
my
brain
said
not
to
be
the
equal
of
his
brain
why
is
my
work
not
paid
equally
with
his
why
must
my
body
be
controlled
by
my
husband
why
may
he
take
my
labor
in
the
household
giving
me
in
exchange
what
he
deems
fit
why
may
he
take
my
children
from
me
will
them
away
while
yet
unborn
let
every
woman
ask
there
are
two
reasons
why
and
these
ultimately
reducible
to
a
single
principle
the
authoritarian
and
its
two
instruments
the
church
that
is
the
priests
and
the
state
that
is
the
legislators
from
the
birth
of
the
church
out
of
the
womb
of
fear
and
the
fatherhood
of
ignorance
it
has
taught
the
inferiority
of
woman
in
one
form
or
another
through
the
various
mythical
legends
of
the
various
mythical
creeds
runs
the
undercurrent
of
the
belief
in
the
fall
of
man
through
the
persuasion
of
woman
her
subjective
condition
as
punishment
her
natural
vileness
total
depravity
etc
and
from
the
days
of
adam
until
now
the
christian
church
with
which
we
have
specially
to
deal
has
made
the
excuse
the
scapegoat
for
the
evil
deeds
of
so
thoroughly
has
this
idea
permeated
society
that
numbers
of
those
who
have
utterly
repudiated
the
church
are
nevertheless
soaked
in
this
stupefying
narcotic
to
true
morality
so
pickled
is
the
male
creation
with
the
vinegar
of
authoritarianism
that
even
those
who
have
gone
further
and
repudiated
the
state
still
cling
to
the
god
society
as
it
is
still
hug
the
old
theological
idea
that
they
are
to
be
heads
of
the
family
to
that
wonderful
formula
of
simple
proportion
that
man
is
the
head
of
the
woman
even
as
christ
is
the
head
of
the
church
no
longer
than
a
week
since
an
anarchist
said
to
me
i
will
be
boss
in
my
own
house
a
if
you
please
who
believe
in
house
about
a
year
ago
a
noted
libertarian
speaker
said
in
my
presence
that
his
sister
who
possessed
a
fine
voice
and
had
joined
a
concert
troupe
should
stay
at
home
with
her
children
that
is
the
old
church
idea
this
man
was
a
socialist
and
since
an
anarchist
yet
his
highest
idea
for
woman
was
serfhood
to
husband
and
children
in
the
present
mockery
called
home
stay
at
home
ye
malcontents
be
patient
obedient
submissive
darn
our
socks
mend
our
shirts
wash
our
dishes
get
our
meals
wait
on
us
and
the
your
fine
voices
are
not
to
delight
the
public
nor
yourselves
your
inventive
genius
is
not
to
work
your
fine
art
taste
is
not
to
be
cultivated
your
business
faculties
are
not
to
be
developed
you
made
the
great
mistake
of
being
born
with
them
suffer
for
your
folly
you
are
therefore
housekeepers
servants
waiters
and
child
nurses
at
macon
in
the
sixth
century
says
august
bebel
the
fathers
of
the
church
met
and
proposed
the
decision
of
the
question
has
woman
a
soul
having
ascertained
that
the
permission
to
own
a
nonentity
going
to
injure
any
of
their
parsnips
a
small
majority
vote
decided
the
momentous
question
in
our
favor
now
holy
fathers
it
was
a
tolerably
good
scheme
on
your
part
to
offer
the
reward
of
your
pitiable
salvation
or
damnation
odds
in
favor
of
the
latter
as
a
bait
for
the
hook
of
earthly
submission
it
was
a
bad
sop
in
those
days
of
faith
and
ignorance
but
fortunately
fourteen
hundred
years
have
made
it
stale
you
tyrant
radicals
have
no
heaven
to
offer
you
have
no
delightful
chimeras
in
the
form
of
merit
cards
you
have
save
the
mark
the
respect
the
good
offices
the
smiles
of
a
this
in
return
for
our
chains
thanks
the
question
of
souls
is
old
we
demand
our
bodies
now
we
are
tired
of
promises
god
is
deaf
and
his
church
is
our
worst
enemy
against
it
we
bring
the
charge
of
being
the
moral
or
immoral
force
which
lies
behind
the
tyranny
of
the
state
and
the
state
has
divided
the
loaves
and
fishes
with
the
church
the
magistrates
like
the
priests
take
marriage
fees
the
two
fetters
of
authority
have
gone
into
partnership
in
the
business
of
granting
to
parents
for
the
privilege
of
reproducing
themselves
and
the
state
cries
as
the
church
cried
of
old
and
cries
now
see
how
we
protect
women
the
state
has
done
more
it
has
often
been
said
to
me
by
women
with
decent
masters
who
had
no
idea
of
the
outrages
practiced
on
their
less
fortunate
sisters
why
the
wives
leave
why
do
you
run
when
your
feet
are
chained
together
why
do
you
cry
out
when
a
gag
is
on
your
lips
why
do
you
raise
your
hands
above
your
head
when
they
are
pinned
fast
to
your
sides
why
do
you
spend
thousands
of
dollars
when
you
have
a
cent
in
your
pocket
why
you
go
to
the
seashore
or
the
mountains
you
fools
scorching
with
city
heat
if
there
is
one
thing
more
than
another
in
this
whole
accursed
tissue
of
false
society
which
makes
me
angry
it
is
the
asinine
stupidity
which
with
the
true
phlegm
of
impenetrable
dullness
says
why
do
the
women
leave
will
you
tell
me
where
they
will
go
and
what
they
shall
do
when
the
state
the
legislators
has
given
to
itself
the
politicians
the
utter
and
absolute
control
of
the
opportunity
to
live
when
through
this
precious
monopoly
already
the
market
of
labor
is
so
overstocked
that
workmen
and
workwomen
are
cutting
each
others
throats
for
the
dear
privilege
of
serving
their
lords
when
girls
are
shipped
from
boston
to
the
south
and
north
shipped
in
carloads
like
cattle
to
fill
the
dives
of
new
orleans
or
the
hells
of
my
own
state
michigan
when
seeing
and
hearing
these
things
reported
every
day
the
proper
prudes
exclaim
why
do
the
women
leave
they
simply
beggar
the
language
of
contempt
when
america
passed
the
fugitive
slave
law
compelling
men
to
catch
their
fellows
more
brutally
than
runaway
dogs
canada
aristocratic
unrepublican
canada
still
stretched
her
arms
to
those
who
might
reach
her
but
there
is
no
refuge
upon
earth
for
the
enslaved
sex
right
where
we
are
there
we
must
dig
our
trenches
and
win
or
die
this
then
is
the
tyranny
of
the
state
it
denies
to
both
woman
and
man
the
right
to
earn
a
living
and
grants
it
as
a
privilege
to
a
favored
few
who
for
that
favor
must
pay
ninety
per
cent
toll
to
the
granters
of
it
these
two
things
the
mind
domination
of
the
church
and
the
body
domination
of
the
state
are
the
causes
of
sex
slavery
first
of
all
it
has
introduced
into
the
world
the
constructed
crime
of
obscenity
it
has
set
up
such
a
peculiar
standard
of
morals
that
to
speak
the
names
of
the
sexual
organs
is
to
commit
the
most
brutal
outrage
it
reminds
me
that
in
your
city
you
have
a
street
called
callowhill
once
it
was
called
gallows
hill
for
the
elevation
to
which
it
leads
now
known
as
cherry
hill
has
been
the
last
touching
place
on
earth
for
the
feet
of
many
a
victim
murdered
by
the
law
but
the
sound
of
the
word
became
too
harsh
so
they
softened
it
though
the
murders
are
still
done
and
the
black
shadow
of
the
gallows
still
hangs
on
the
city
of
brotherly
love
obscenity
has
done
the
same
it
has
placed
virtue
in
the
shell
of
an
idea
and
labelled
all
good
which
dwells
within
the
sanction
of
law
and
respectable
custom
and
all
bad
which
contravenes
the
usage
of
the
shell
it
has
lowered
the
dignity
of
the
human
body
below
the
level
of
all
other
animals
who
thinks
a
dog
is
impure
or
obscene
because
its
body
is
not
covered
with
suffocating
and
annoying
clothes
what
would
you
think
of
the
meanness
of
a
man
who
would
put
a
skirt
upon
his
horse
and
compel
it
to
walk
or
run
with
such
a
thing
impeding
its
limbs
why
the
society
for
the
prevention
of
cruelty
to
animals
would
arrest
him
take
the
beast
from
him
and
he
would
be
sent
to
a
lunatic
asylum
for
treatment
on
the
score
of
an
mind
and
yet
gentlemen
you
expect
your
wives
the
creatures
you
say
you
respect
and
love
to
wear
the
longest
skirts
and
the
highest
necked
clothing
in
order
to
conceal
the
human
there
is
no
society
for
the
prevention
of
cruelty
to
women
and
you
yourselves
though
a
little
better
look
at
the
heat
you
wear
in
this
roasting
weather
how
you
curse
your
poor
body
with
the
wool
you
steal
from
the
sheep
how
you
punish
yourselves
to
sit
in
a
crowded

dead
mme
grundy
is
shocked
at
the
vulgarity
of
shirt
sleeves
or
the
naked
arm
look
how
the
ideal
of
beauty
has
been
marred
by
this
obscenity
notion
divest
yourselves
of
prejudice
for
once
look
at
some
woman
her
waist
surrounded
by
a
fence
called
a
corset
her
shoulders
and
hips
angular
from
the
pressure
above
and
below
her
feet
narrowest
where
they
should
be
widest
the
body
fettered
by
her
everlasting
prison
skirt
her
hair
fastened
tight
enough
to
make
her
head
ache
and
surmounted
by
a
thing
of
neither
sense
nor
beauty
called
a
hat
ten
to
one
a
hump
upon
her
back
like
a
dromedary
look
at
her
and
then
imagine
such
a
thing
as
that
carved
in
marble
fancy
a
statue
in
fairmount
park
with
a
corset
and
bustle
on
picture
to
yourselves
the
image
of
the
equestrienne
we
are
permitted
to
ride
providing
we
sit
in
a
position
ruinous
to
the
horse
providing
we
wear
a
long
enough
to
hide
the
obscene
human
foot
weighed
down
by
ten
pounds
of
gravel
to
cheat
the
wind
in
its
free
blowing
so
running
the
risk
of
disabling
ourselves
completely
should
accident
throw
us
from
the
saddle
think
how
we
swim
we
must
even
wear
clothing
in
the
water
and
run
the
gauntlet
of
derision
if
we
dare
battle
in
the
surf
minus
stockings
imagine
a
fish
trying
to
make
headway
with
a
flannel
garment
upon
it
nor
are
you
yet
content
the
vile
standard
of
obscenity
even
kills
the
little
babies
with
clothes
the
human
race
is
murdered
horribly
in
the
name
of
dress
and
in
the
name
of
purity
what
lies
are
told
what
queer
morality
it
has
engendered
for
fear
of
it
you
dare
not
tell
your
own
children
the
truth
about
their
birth
the
most
sacred
of
all
functions
the
creation
of
a
human
being
is
a
subject
for
the
most
miserable
falsehood
when
they
come
to
you
with
a
simple
straightforward
question
which
they
have
a
right
to
ask
you
say
do
ask
such
questions
or
tell
some
silly
story
or
you
explain
the
incomprehensibility
by
another
god
you
say
god
made
you
you
know
you
are
lying
when
you
say
it
you
know
or
you
ought
to
know
that
the
source
of
inquiry
will
not
be
dammed
up
so
you
know
that
what
you
could
explain
purely
reverently
rightly
if
you
have
any
purity
in
you
will
be
learned
through
many
blind
gropings
and
that
around
it
will
be
cast
the
of
wrong
embryo
by
your
denial
and
nurtured
by
this
social
opinion
everywhere
prevalent
if
you
do
not
know
this
then
you
are
blind
to
facts
and
deaf
to
experience
think
of
the
double
social
standard
the
enslavement
of
our
sex
has
evolved
women
considering
themselves
very
pure
and
very
moral
will
sneer
at
the
yet
admit
to
their
homes
the
very
men
who
victimized
the
men
at
their
best
will
pity
the
prostitute
while
they
themselves
are
the
worst
kind
of
prostitutes
pity
yourselves
gentlemen
you
need
it
how
many
times
do
you
see
where
a
man
or
woman
has
shot
another
through
jealousy
the
standard
of
purity
has
decided
that
it
is
right
it
shows
spirit
it
is
justifiable
to
murder
a
human
being
for
doing
exactly
what
you
did
yourself
love
the
same
woman
or
same
man
morality
honor
virtue
passing
from
the
moral
to
the
physical
phase
take
the
statistics
of
any
insane
asylum
and
you
will
find
that
out
of
the
different
classes
unmarried
women
furnish
the
largest
one
to
preserve
your
cruel
vicious
indecent
standard
of
purity
you
drive
your
daughters
insane
while
your
wives
are
killed
with
excess
such
is
marriage
do
take
my
word
for
it
go
through
the
report
of
any
asylum
or
the
annals
of
any
graveyard
look
how
your
children
grow
up
taught
from
their
earliest
infancy
to
curb
their
love
natures
restrained
at
every
turn
your
blasting
lies
would
even
blacken
a
child
kiss
little
girls
must
not
be
tomboyish
must
not
go
barefoot
must
not
climb
trees
must
not
learn
to
swim
must
not
do
anything
they
desire
to
do
which
madame
grundy
has
decreed
improper
little
boys
are
laughed
at
as
effeminate
silly
if
they
want
to
make
patchwork
or
play
with
a
doll
then
when
they
grow
up
oh
men
do
care
for
home
or
children
as
women
do
why
should
they
when
the
deliberate
effort
of
your
life
has
been
to
crush
that
nature
out
of
them
women
ca
rough
it
like
men
train
any
animal
or
any
plant
as
you
train
your
girls
and
it
wo
be
able
to
rough
it
either
now
somebody
tell
me
why
either
sex
should
hold
a
corner
on
athletic
sports
why
any
child
should
not
have
free
use
of
its
limbs
these
are
the
effects
of
your
purity
standard
your
marriage
law
this
is
your
work
look
at
it
half
your
children
dying
under
five
years
of
age
your
girls
insane
your
married
women
walking
corpses
your
men
so
bad
that
they
themselves
often
admit
holds
bond
of
this
is
the
beautiful
effect
of
your
god
marriage
before
which
natural
desire
must
abase
and
belie
itself
be
proud
of
it
now
for
the
remedy
it
is
in
one
word
the
only
word
that
ever
brought
equity
anywhere
centuries
upon
centuries
of
liberty
is
the
only
thing
that
will
cause
the
disintegration
and
decay
of
these
pestiferous
ideas
liberty
was
all
that
calmed
the
of
religious
persecution
you
can
not
cure
serfhood
by
any
other
substitution
not
for
you
to
say
in
this
way
shall
the
race
love
let
the
race
will
there
not
be
atrocious
crimes
certainly
he
is
a
fool
who
says
there
will
not
be
but
you
ca
stop
them
by
committing
the
and
setting
a
block
between
the
spokes
of
you
will
never
get
right
until
you
start
right
as
for
the
final
outcome
it
matters
not
one
iota
i
have
my
ideal
and
it
is
very
pure
and
very
sacred
to
me
but
yours
equally
sacred
may
be
different
and
we
may
both
be
wrong
but
certain
am
i
that
with
free
contract
that
form
of
sexual
association
will
survive
which
is
best
adapted
to
time
and
place
thus
producing
the
highest
evolution
of
the
type
whether
that
shall
be
monogamy
variety
or
promiscuity
matters
naught
to
us
it
is
the
business
of
the
future
to
which
we
dare
not
dictate
for
freedom
spoke
moses
harman
and
for
this
he
received
the
brand
for
this
he
sits
in
his
cell
whether
it
is
possible
that
his
sentence
be
shortened
we
do
not
know
we
can
only
try
those
who
would
help
us
try
let
me
ask
to
put
your
signatures
to
this
simple
request
for
pardon
addressed
to
benjamin
harrison
to
those
who
desire
more
fully
to
inform
themselves
before
signing
i
say
your
conscientiousness
is
praiseworthy
come
to
me
at
the
close
of
the
meeting
and
i
will
quote
the
exact
language
of
the
markland
letter
to
those
extreme
anarchists
who
can
not
bend
their
dignity
to
ask
pardon
for
an
offense
not
committed
and
of
an
authority
they
can
not
recognize
let
me
say
moses
harman
back
is
bent
low
bent
by
the
brute
force
of
the
law
and
though
i
would
never
ask
anyone
to
bow
for
himself
i
can
ask
it
and
easily
ask
it
for
him
who
fights
the
slave
battle
your
dignity
is
criminal
every
hour
behind
the
bars
is
a
seal
to
your
partnership
with
comstock
no
one
can
hate
petitions
worse
than
i
no
one
has
less
faith
in
them
than
i
but
for
champion
i
am
willing
to
try
any
means
that
invades
no
other
right
even
though
i
have
little
hope
in
it
if
beyond
these
there
are
those
here
who
have
ever
forced
sexual
servitude
from
a
wife
those
who
have
prostituted
themselves
in
the
name
of
virtue
those
who
have
brought
diseased
immoral
or
unwelcome
children
to
the
light
without
the
means
of
provision
for
them
and
yet
will
go
from
this
hall
and
say
moses
harman
is
an
unclean
man
a
man
rewarded
by
just
punishment
then
to
i
say
and
may
the
words
ring
deep
within
your
ears
until
you
die
go
on
drive
your
sheep
to
the
shambles
crush
that
old
sick
crippled
man
beneath
your
juggernaut
in
the
name
of
virtue
purity
and
morality
do
it
in
the
name
of
god
home
and
heaven
do
it
in
the
name
of
the
nazarene
who
preached
the
golden
rule
do
it
in
the
name
of
justice
principle
and
honor
do
it
in
the
name
of
bravery
and
magnanimity
put
yourself
on
the
side
of
the
robber
in
the
government
halls
the
murderer
in
the
political
convention
the
libertine
in
public
places
the
whole
brute
force
of
the
police
the
constabulary
the
court
and
the
penitentiary
to
persecute
one
poor
old
man
who
stood
alone
against
your
licensed
crime
do
it
and
if
moses
harman
dies
within
your
kansas
hell
be
satisfied
you
have
murdered
kill
him
and
you
hasten
the
day
when
the
future
shall
bury
you
ten
thousand
fathoms
deep
beneath
its
curses
kill
him
and
the
stripes
upon
his
prison
clothes
shall
lash
you
like
the
knout
kill
him
and
the
insane
shall
glitter
hate
at
you
with
their
wild
eyes
the
unborn
babes
shall
cry
their
blood
upon
you
and
the
graves
that
you
have
filled
in
the
name
of
marriage
shall
yield
food
for
a
race
that
will
pillory
you
until
the
memory
of
your
atrocity
has
become
a
nameless
ghost
flitting
with
the
shades
of
torquemada
calvin
and
jehovah
over
the
horizon
of
the
world
would
you
smile
to
see
him
dead
would
you
say
we
are
rid
of
this
obscenist
fools
the
corpse
would
laugh
at
you
from
its
cold
eyelids
the
motionless
lips
would
mock
and
the
solemn
hands
the
pulseless
folded
hands
in
their
quietness
would
write
the
last
indictment
which
neither
time
nor
you
can
efface
kill
him
and
you
write
his
glory
and
your
shame
moses
harman
in
his
felon
stripes
stands
far
above
you
now
and
moses
harman
will
live
on
immortal
in
the
race
he
died
to
free
kill
him
literature
the
mirror
of
man
perhaps
i
had
better
say
the
the
reflection
of
all
that
he
has
been
and
is
the
hinting
of
something
of
what
he
may
become
in
so
considering
it
let
it
be
understood
that
i
speak
of
no
particular
form
of
literature
but
the
entire
body
of
a
expressed
thought
preserved
either
traditionally
in
writing
or
in
print
the
majority
of
lightly
thinking
fairly
read
people
who
make
use
of
the
word
literature
rather
easily
do
so
with
a
very
indistinct
idea
of
its
content
to
them
it
usually
means
a
certain
limited
form
of
human
expression
chiefly
works
of
the
imagination
poetry
drama
the
various
forms
of
the
novel
history
philosophy
science
are
rather
frowning
names
stern
second
cousins
as
it
were
to
the
beguiling
companions
of
their
pleasant
leisure
hours
not
legitimately
literature
biography
well
it
depends
on
who
writes
it
if
it
can
be
made
so
much
like
a
work
of
fiction
that
the
subject
sketched
serves
the
purposes
of
a
fictive
hero
why
then
maybe
to
such
talkers
about
literature
evidence
of
familiarity
with
it
and
title
to
have
one
opinions
thereon
asked
and
respected
are
witnessed
by
the
ability
to
run
glibly
off
the
names
of
the
personages
in
the
dramas
of
ibsen
björnson
maeterlinck
hauptmann
or
shaw
or
in
the
novels
of
gorki
andreyev
tolstoy
zola
maupassant
hardy
and
the
dozen
or
so
of
lesser
lights
who
revolve
with
these
through
the
cycle
of
the
magazine
issues
not
only
do
these
same
people
thus
limit
the
field
of
literature
at
least
in
their
ordinary
conversation
if
you
press
them
they
will
dubiously
admit
that
the
field
may
be
extended
but
they
are
also
possessed
of
the
notion
that
only
one
particular
mode
even
of
fiction
is
in
fact
the
genuine
thing
that
this
mode
has
not
always
been
in
vogue
they
are
aware
and
they
allow
other
modes
to
have
been
literature
in
the
past
as
a
sort
of
kindly
concession
to
the
past
a
to
its
unevolved
state
at
present
however
no
indulgences
are
allowed
whatever
is
not
the
mode
is
anathema
it
is
not
literature
at
all
when
confronted
by
the
great
names
of
the
past
which
they
can
neither
consign
to
oblivion
nor
patronize
by
toleration
for
their
undeveloped
condition
names
which
are
names
for
all
ages
which
they
need
to
use
as
conjuration
words
in
their
comparisons
and
criticisms
names
such
as
shakespeare
or
hugo
they
complacently
close
their
eyes
to
contradictions
and
swear
that
fundamentally
these
men
works
in
the
modern
mode
the
accepted
mode
the
one
and
only
enduring
the
mode
that
they
approve
which
is
i
hear
you
ask
what
they
are
pleased
to
call
realism
if
you
wish
to
know
how
far
they
are
obsessed
by
this
notion
go
pick
yourself
a
quiet
corner
in
some
café
where
light
literature
readers
meet
to
make
comparisons
and
listen
to
the
comments
before
very
long
voices
will
be
getting
loud
about
some
character
at
present
stalking
across
the
pages
of
the
magazines
or
bestirring
itself
among
the
latest
ton
of
novel
and
the
dispute
will
be
does
such
a
type
exist
of
course
he
exists
he
does
not
exist
he
must
exist
he
can
not
exist
under
such
conditions
there
are
no
such
conditions
but
be
reasonable
you
have
not
been
in
all
places
and
you
can
not
say
there
may
not
be
such
conditions
supposing
all
right
i
will
give
you
the
conditions
all
the
same
no
man
would
act
so
under
any
conditions
i
swear
l
have
seen
such
men
impossible
what
is
there
impossible
about
it
and
the
voices
get
louder
and
louder
as
the
disputants
proceed
to
pick
the
character
to
pieces
speech
by
speech
and
action
by
action
till
nothing
being
left
each
finally
subsides
somehow
each
confirmed
in
his
own
opinion
each
convinced
that
the
main
purpose
of
literature
realism
has
either
been
served
or
not
served
by
the
author
under
discussion
to
such
disputants
literature
the
mirror
of
man
means
that
only
such
literature
as
gives
absolutely
faithful
representations
of
life
as
it
is
demonstrably
lived
is
a
genuine
mirror
no
author
is
to
be
considered
worthy
of
a
place
unless
his
works
can
be
at
least
twisted
to
fit
this
conception
with
some
slight
refinement
of
idea
in
so
far
as
it
recognizes
the
obscurer
recesses
of
the
mind
as
entitled
to
representation
as
well
as
the
externals
it
corresponds
to
the
development
of
portrait
painting
which
esteemed
it
necessary
to
paint
the
exact
number
of
hairs
in
the
wart
on
oliver
cromwell
nose
in
order
to
have
a
true
likeness
of
him
as
before
suggested
i
do
not
when
i
speak
of
literature
as
the
mirror
of
man
have
any
such
mirror
in
view
nor
the
limitation
of
literature
to
any
one
form
of
it
to
any
one
age
of
it
to
any
set
of
standard
names
nor
the
limitation
of
man
to
any
preconceived
notion
of
just
what
he
may
logically
be
allowed
to
be
the
composite
image
we
are
seeking
to
find
is
an
image
wrought
as
much
of
his
dreams
of
what
he
would
like
to
be
as
of
his
actual
being
that
is
no
true
picture
of
man
which
does
not
include
his
cravings
for
the
impossible
as
well
as
his
daily
performance
of
the
possible
indeed
the
logical
calculable
man
the
man
who
under
certain
circumstances
may
be
figured
out
to
turn
murderer
and
under
others
saint
is
hardly
so
interesting
as
the
illogical
being
who
upsets
the
calculation
by
becoming
neither
but
something
not
at
all
predictable
the
objects
of
my
lecture
then
are
these
to
insist
on
a
wider
view
of
literature
itself
than
that
generally
accepted
to
suggest
to
readers
a
more
satisfactory
way
of
considering
what
they
read
than
that
usually
received
to
point
to
certain
phases
of
the
human
appearance
reflected
in
the
mirror
which
are
not
generally
noticed
but
which
i
find
interesting
and
suggestive
you
would
think
it
very
unreasonable
would
you
not
for
any
one
to
insist
that
because
your
highly
polished
glass
backed
by
quicksilver
gives
back
so
clear
and
excellent
an
image
the
watery
vision
you
catch
of
yourself
in
the
shifting
glancing
ripples
of
a
clear
stream
is
not
an
image
at
all
with
all
the
curious
elongating
and
drifting
and
shortening
back
and
breaking
up
into
wavering
circles
done
by
that
unresting
image
you
know
very
certainly
that
is
you
and
if
you
look
into
the
still
waters
of
some
summer
pool
or
mountain
the
image
there
is
almost
as
as
that
in
your
polished
glass
except
for
the
vague
tremor
that
seems
to
move
under
the
water
rather
than
on
its
surface
and
suggest
an
ethereal
something
missing
in
your
shadow
yet
that
vision
conjured
in
the
is
you
surely
you
nay
even
more
that
image
of
you
you
perceived
when
as
a
child
you
danced
in
the
firelight
and
saw
a
misshapen
darkness
rising
and
falling
along
the
wall
in
teasing
mockery
that
too
was
surely
an
image
of
you
an
image
of
interception
not
of
reflection
a
blur
a
vacancy
a
horror
from
which
you
fled
shrieking
to
your
mother
arms
and
yet
it
was
the
distorted
outline
of
you
you
grew
familiar
with
it
later
amused
yourself
with
it
twisted
your
hands
into
strange
positions
to
see
what
curious
shapes
they
would
form
upon
the
wall
and
made
whole
stories
with
the
shadows
long
afterward
you
went
back
to
them
with
deliberate
and
careful
curiosity
to
see
how
the
figures
stumbled
on
by
accident
could
be
definitely
produced
at
will
according
to
the
laws
of
interception
even
so
the
first
cast
back
from
the
blank
wall
of
language
are
uncouth
ungraspable
vague
vacant
menacing
to
the
men
who
saw
them
frightful
mankind
produced
this
paradox
the
early
of
literature
were
later
these
darknesses
grew
less
fearsome
the
began
to
jest
with
them
to
multiply
figures
and
send
them
chasing
past
each
other
up
and
down
the
wall
with
fresh
glee
at
each
newly
created
the
wall
at
last
became
luminous
the
shadows
shining
and
out
of
the
old
monosyllabic
horror
of
the
primitive
legend
out
of
man
fright
at
the
projection
of
his
own
soul
out
of
his
wide
stare
at
those
terrific
giants
on
the
wall
who
suddenly
with
shifting
became
grotesque
dwarfs
and
mocking
little
beasts
that
danced
and
floated
ever
most
fearful
because
of
their
elusive
emptiness
out
of
this
bit
by
bit
grew
the
steady
contemplation
the
gradual
effacement
of
fright
the
feeling
of
power
and
amusement
and
the
sense
of
creative
mastery
which
understanding
the
shadows
began
to
command
them
till
there
arose
all
the
beauty
of
fairy
tales
and
shining
myths
and
singing
legends
now
any
one
who
desires
to
see
in
literature
the
most
that
there
is
in
it
who
desires
to
read
not
merely
for
the
absorption
of
the
moment
but
for
the
sake
of
permanent
impression
who
wishes
to
have
an
idea
of
man
not
only
as
he
is
now
but
through
the
whole
articulate
record
of
his
existence
who
would
know
the
thoughts
of
his
infancy
and
the
connected
course
of
his
development
and
no
one
has
any
adequate
conception
of
the
glory
of
literature
unless
he
includes
this
much
in
it
any
such
a
reader
i
say
must
find
among
its
most
attractive
pages
the
stories
of
early
superstitions
the
fictions
of
fear
the
struggles
of
the
intelligence
with
overlooming
problems
think
of
the
ages
and
ages
that
men
saw
the
demon
electricity
riding
the
air
think
that
even
now
they
do
not
know
what
he
is
and
yet
he
played
mightily
with
their
daily
lives
for
all
those
ages
think
how
this
staring
savage
was
put
face
to
face
with
which
were
spun
and
tossed
around
him
and
compelled
by
the
nature
of
his
own
activity
to
try
to
find
an
explanation
to
them
think
that
most
of
us
if
we
were
not
the
heritors
of
the
ages
that
have
passed
since
then
should
be
staggered
and
even
now
by
all
these
lights
and
forms
through
which
we
move
and
then
turn
to
the
record
of
those
pathetic
strivings
of
the
frightened
child
with
some
little
tenderness
and
sympathy
some
solemn
curiosity
to
know
men
were
able
to
think
and
feel
when
they
led
their
lives
as
in
a
threatening
where
everything
was
an
unknown
invested
with
crouching
hostility
and
never
be
too
sure
you
know
just
how
men
will
act
or
try
to
act
under
any
conditions
if
you
have
not
read
the
record
of
what
they
have
thought
and
fancied
and
done
and
after
you
have
read
it
oh
then
you
will
never
be
sure
you
know
for
then
you
will
realize
that
every
man
is
a
full
of
dead
men
ghosts
and
the
ghosts
of
very
very
ancient
days
are
there
forever
whispering
in
an
ancient
ancient
tongue
of
ancient
passions
and
desires
and
prompting
many
actions
which
the
doer
thereof
can
give
himself
no
accounting
for
there
are
two
ways
of
reading
these
old
stories
and
as
one
who
has
gotten
pleasure
and
profit
too
from
both
i
would
recommend
them
both
to
be
used
the
first
way
is
to
read
yourself
backward
into
it
as
much
as
possible
do
not
be
a
critic
on
first
reading
put
the
critic
asleep
let
yourself
to
believe
as
did
he
who
wrote
it
read
it
aloud
if
you
are
where
you
will
not
annoy
anybody
let
the
words
sing
themselves
over
your
lips
as
they
sung
themselves
over
the
lips
of
the
people
who
were
dead
so
long
ago
in
their
strange
homes
with
their
vanished
surroundings
sung
themselves
just
as
the
wind
sung
through
the
echoing
forests
and
murmured
back
from
the
rocks
just
as
the
songs
slipped
out
of
the
birds
throats
you
will
find
that
half
the
beauty
and
the
farce
of
legend
lies
in
the
bare
sound
of
it
far
far
more
is
it
dependent
on
the
voice
than
any
modern
writings
are
and
surely
the
reason
is
simple
enough
for
was
not
in
its
creation
ancient
literature
addressed
itself
to
the
ear
always
while
modern
literature
speaks
to
the
eye
if
once
you
can
get
your
ears
washing
with
the
sounds
of
the
old
language
as
with
the
washing
of
the
seas
when
you
sit
on
the
beach
or
the
lapping
of
the
rivers
when
the
caresses
you
some
idle
summer
afternoon
it
will
be
much
easier
for
you
to
forget
that
you
are
the
child
of
another
age
and
thought
you
will
begin
to
luxuriate
in
fancies
and
prefigure
impossibilities
then
you
will
know
how
it
feels
to
be
fancy
free
loosed
from
the
chain
of
the
possible
and
once
having
felt
you
will
also
understand
better
when
you
with
other
intent
when
you
are
ready
for
such
then
be
as
critical
as
you
please
which
does
not
necessarily
mean
be
condemnatory
it
means
rather
take
notice
of
all
generals
and
particulars
and
question
them
you
will
naturally
pose
yourself
the
question
why
is
it
that
the
bare
sounds
of
these
old
stories
are
so
much
more
vibrating
shrilling
at
times
than
any
modern
song
or
poem
you
will
find
that
the
mitigating
influence
of
civilization
knowledge
moderation
creeping
into
expression
produces
flat
neutral
diluted
sounds
watery
words
so
to
speak
out
and
glidingly
inoffensive
in
any
modern
writing
remarkable
for
strength
will
be
found
a
preponderance
of
barbaric
yawp
as
whitman
called
it
fear
creates
sharp
cries
the
rebound
of
fear
which
is
bravado
produces
roars
and
growls
unrestrained
passions
howl
in
irregular
breaking
short
off
god
carries
a
hammer
and
love
a
spear
the
hymn
clangs
and
the
clashes
through
those
fierce
sounds
one
feels
again
hot
hearts
those
who
perceive
colors
accompanying
sounds
sense
clean
cut
lights
streaking
the
of
these
early
sharp
hard
reds
and
yellows
it
is
our
later
world
which
has
produced
green
tintings
not
to
be
told
from
gray
nor
gray
from
blue
nor
anything
from
anything
in
our
fondness
for
smoothness
and
gradation
we
have
attained
practical
colorlessness
if
it
appears
to
you
that
i
am
talking
nonsense
permit
me
to
tell
you
it
is
because
you
have
dulled
your
own
powers
of
perception
in
seeking
to
become
too
intellectually
appreciative
you
have
lost
the
power
to
feel
primitive
things
try
to
recover
it
another
source
of
interesting
observation
especially
in
english
literature
of
early
writing
this
time
the
eye
it
is
admitted
by
everybody
that
as
a
serviceable
instrument
for
expressing
definite
sounds
in
an
expeditious
and
comprehensible
manner
english
written
language
is
a
woeful
failure
if
any
inventor
of
a
theory
of
symbols
should
would
or
could
have
devised
such
a
ridiculous
conception
of
spelling
such
a
of
contradictory
jumbles
he
would
properly
have
been
adjudged
to
an
insane
asylum
and
that
every
man
who
ever
contrived
an
english
and
every
teacher
who
is
obliged
to
worry
this
incongruous
mess
through
the
steadily
revolting
process
of
children
is
ably
convinced
but
man
man
has
actually
such
conception
he
probably
executed
it
first
and
conceived
it
afterward
as
most
of
our
poor
victims
do
when
they
start
on
that
terrible
blind
road
through
the
whether
or
no
the
thing
is
here
and
we
all
to
accept
it
and
deal
with
it
as
best
we
may
sadly
hoping
that
possibly
the
tenth
generation
from
now
may
at
least
be
rid
of
a
few
unnecessary
e
and
since
the
thing
is
here
and
is
a
mighty
creation
and
very
indicative
of
how
the
human
brain
in
large
sections
works
since
got
to
put
up
with
it
anyway
we
may
as
well
in
revenge
for
its
many
inconveniences
get
what
little
satisfaction
we
can
out
of
it
and
i
find
it
one
of
the
most
delightful
little
side
amusements
of
wandering
through
the
field
of
old
literature
while
in
the
critical
vein
to
stray
around
among
the
old
stumps
and
crooked
cowpaths
of
english
spelling
much
pleasure
is
to
be
derived
from
seeing
what
old
words
grew
together
and
made
new
ones
what
syllables
or
letters
got
lopped
off
or
twisted
how
silent
letters
became
silent
and
why
from
what
older
language
planted
and
what
its
relatives
are
it
is
much
the
same
pleasure
that
one
gets
from
trailing
around
through
the
narrow
crooked
streets
and
senseless
meanderings
of
london
city
everybody
knows
it
a
foolish
way
to
build
a
city
that
all
streets
should
be
straight
and
wide
and
but
since
they
are
not
and
london
is
too
big
for
one
individual
exertion
to
reform
one
consents
to
take
interest
in
explaining
the
crookedness
in
mentally
dissolving
the
great
city
into
the
hundred
little
villages
which
coalesced
to
make
it
in
marking
this
point
as
the
place
where
knelt
and
prayed
once
and
therefore
there
had
to
be
a
here
and
this
other
point
as
the
place
where
the
road
swept
round
because
martyrs
were
wont
to
be
burnt
there
etc
the
trouble
is
that
after
a
while
one
gets
to
love
all
that
quaint
illogical
tangle
seeing
always
the
thousand
years
of
history
in
it
and
so
one
senses
actually
become
vitiated
enough
to
permit
him
to
love
the
outrages
of
english
spelling
because
of
the
features
of
men
souls
that
are
imaged
therein
when
i
look
at
the
word
laugh
i
fancy
i
hear
the
joyous
deep
guttural
of
the
old
saxon
who
died
long
before
the
foreign
graft
on
the
english
stock
softened
the
gh
to
an
f
really
one
must
become
more
patient
with
the
knowing
how
it
grew
and
feeling
that
this
is
the
way
of
man
the
way
he
always
grows
not
as
he
ought
but
as
he
can
i
have
spoken
of
forms
as
to
the
spirit
of
those
early
writings
full
of
inarticulate
religious
sentiment
emotions
so
strong
they
burst
from
the
utterer
throat
one
might
almost
say
in
barks
gloomy
and
foreboding
these
gradually
changing
to
more
lightsome
fancies
beauty
delicacy
airiness
taking
their
place
as
in
the
fairy
tales
and
of
the
people
wherein
the
deeds
of
supernaturals
are
sported
with
and
it
becomes
evident
that
love
and
winsomeness
are
usurping
the
kingdom
of
power
and
fear
through
all
we
are
compelled
to
observe
one
constant
tendency
of
the
human
mind
the
desire
to
free
itself
from
its
own
conditions
to
be
what
it
is
not
to
represent
itself
as
something
beyond
its
powers
of
accomplishment
in
their
minds
men
had
wings
and
breathed
in
water
and
swam
on
land
and
ate
air
and
thrived
in
deserts
and
walked
through
seas
and
gathered
roses
off
and
collected
frozen
dew
off
the
tails
of
sunbeams
dispersed
mountains
with
mustard
seeds
of
faith
and
climbed
into
solid
caves
under
the
rainbow
did
everything
which
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
do
it
is
in
fact
this
imaginative
faculty
which
has
the
accomplishments
of
science
and
while
under
the
influence
of
practical
experiment
and
the
extension
of
knowledge
such
dreams
have
passed
away
this
much
remains
and
will
long
long
remain
in
humankind
covered
over
and
shamefacedly
concealed
as
much
as
may
be
that
men
perpetually
conceive
themselves
as
chrysalid
heroes
and
wonder
workers
and
under
strain
of
occasion
this
element
crops
out
in
their
actions
making
them
do
all
manner
of
curious
things
which
the
of
realism
will
declare
utterly
illogical
and
impossible
often
it
is
the
commonest
men
who
do
them
i
have
a
fondness
for
realism
myself
at
least
i
have
a
very
wicked
feeling
towards
what
is
called
symbolism
and
various
other
things
which
i
do
understand
but
as
the
unrealists
the
exaggeratists
the
express
what
i
believe
to
be
a
very
permanent
characteristic
of
humankind
as
evidenced
in
all
the
traces
of
its
work
i
think
they
probably
give
quite
as
true
reflections
of
man
soul
as
the
present
favorites
these
early
literatures
most
of
which
have
of
course
been
lost
were
the
embryos
of
our
more
imposing
creations
and
it
is
a
pleasant
and
an
instructive
thing
to
follow
the
unfolding
of
monster
tales
into
great
religious
literatures
to
compare
them
and
see
how
the
same
few
simple
figures
either
transplanted
or
spontaneously
produced
at
different
points
evolved
into
all
manner
of
creators
redeemers
and
miracles
in
their
various
altered
habitats
no
one
can
so
thoroughly
appreciate
what
is
in
the
face
of
a
man
turned
upward
in
prayer
as
he
who
has
followed
the
evolution
of
the
black
monster
up
to
that
impersonal
conception
of
god
prettily
called
by
quakers
the
inner
light
fairy
tales
on
the
other
hand
have
evolved
into
allegories
and
dramas
first
the
dramas
of
the
sky
now
the
dramas
of
earth
tales
of
sexual
exploits
have
become
novels
novelettes
short
stories
sketches
a
countenance
of
man
but
the
old
heroic
legend
and
the
hero
is
always
the
next
born
after
the
monster
in
the
is
the
lineal
progenitor
of
history
history
which
was
first
the
glorification
of
a
warrior
and
his
aids
then
the
story
of
kings
courts
and
intrigues
now
mostly
the
report
of
the
deeds
of
nations
in
their
ugly
moods
and
the
record
of
what
people
have
done
in
their
more
amiable
moments
the
record
of
the
conquests
of
peace
how
men
have
lived
and
labored
dug
and
built
hewn
and
cleared
gardened
and
reforested
organized
and
coöperated
manufactured
and
used
educated
and
amused
themselves
those
of
us
who
aspire
to
be
more
or
less
suggesters
of
social
change
are
greatly
at
a
loss
if
we
do
not
know
the
face
of
man
as
reflected
in
history
and
i
mean
as
much
the
reflection
of
the
minds
of
historians
as
seen
in
their
histories
as
the
reflection
of
the
minds
of
others
they
sought
to
give
not
so
much
in
the
direct
expression
of
their
opinion
either
as
in
the
choice
of
what
they
thought
it
worth
while
to
try
to
stamp
perpetuity
upon
when
we
read
in
the
chronicle
these
items
which
are
characteristic
of
the
whole
this
year
cynegils
succeeded
to
the
government
in
wessex
and
held
it
winters
cynegils
was
the
son
of
ceol
ceol
of
cutha
cutha
of
cymric
and
then
this
year
cynegils
and
cuiehelm
fought
at
bampton
and
slew
of
the
welsh
and
then
this
year
appeared
the
comet
star
in
august
and
shone
every
morning
during
three
months
like
a
sunbeam
bishop
wilfred
being
driven
from
his
bishopric
by
king
everth
two
bishops
were
consecrated
in
his
stead
when
we
read
these
we
have
not
any
very
adequate
conception
of
what
the
people
were
doing
but
we
have
a
very
striking
and
lasting
impression
of
what
the
only
men
who
tried
to
write
history
at
all
in
that
period
of
english
existence
thought
it
was
worth
while
to
record
cynegils
was
the
son
of
ceol
and
he
of
cutha
and
cutha
of
cymric
it
reads
considerably
like
a
pedigree
book
the
trouble
is
we
have
no
particular
notion
of
cymric
probably
if
we
went
back
we
should
find
he
was
the
son
of
somebody
but
at
any
rate
he
had
a
grandson
and
the
grandson
was
a
king
and
the
chronicler
therefore
recorded
him
nothing
happened
for
three
years
and
then
the
chronicle
records
that
two
kings
fought
and
slew
men
then
comes
the
momentous
year
when
a
comet
appeared
and
a
bishop
lost
his
job
no
doubt
the
comet
foretold
the
loss
there
are
no
records
of
when
shoemakers
lost
their
jobs
that
i
know
of
nor
how
many
shoemakers
were
put
in
their
places
and
i
imagine
it
would
have
been
at
least
as
interesting
for
us
to
know
as
the
little
matter
of
bishop
wilfred
but
the
chronicler
did
not
think
so
he
preserved
the
bishop
troubles
no
doubt
he
did
just
what
the
shoemakers
of
the
time
would
also
have
done
providing
they
had
been
also
chroniclers
it
is
a
fair
sample
of
what
was
in
men
minds
as
if
any
one
fancies
that
this
disposition
has
quite
vanished
let
him
pick
up
any
ordinary
history
and
see
how
many
pages
relatively
are
devoted
to
the
doings
of
persons
intent
on
slaying
and
those
intent
on
peaceful
occupation
and
how
many
times
we
are
told
that
certain
politicians
lost
their
jobs
and
how
we
are
not
told
anything
about
the
ordinary
people
losing
their
jobs
and
then
reflect
whether
the
old
face
of
is
quite
another
face
yet
biography
as
a
sort
of
second
offspring
of
the
hero
legend
is
another
revelation
when
we
read
it
not
only
to
know
its
subject
but
to
know
its
writer
the
standpoint
from
which
he
values
another
man
life
ordinarily
there
is
a
great
deal
of
cynegils
the
son
of
cutha
the
son
of
cymric
in
it
and
a
great
deal
of
emphasis
upon
the
man
as
an
individual
phenomenon
when
really
he
would
be
more
interesting
and
more
comprehensible
left
in
connection
with
the
series
of
phenomena
of
which
he
was
part
as
an
example
of
what
to
me
is
a
perfect
biography
i
instance
conway
life
of
thomas
paine
itself
a
valuable
history
but
it
is
not
so
correct
a
mirror
of
the
general
attitude
of
biographers
and
readers
of
biography
as
bosworth
life
of
johnson
except
in
so
far
as
it
indicates
that
the
great
face
in
the
glass
is
changing
it
is
rather
the
type
of
what
biography
is
than
what
it
has
been
or
is
there
are
two
divisions
of
literature
which
are
generally
named
in
one
breath
and
are
certainly
closely
connected
and
yet
the
one
came
to
highly
perfected
forms
long
long
ago
while
the
other
is
properly
speaking
very
young
and
for
all
that
the
older
is
the
handmaid
of
the
younger
i
mean
the
literatures
of
philosophy
and
science
philosophy
is
simply
the
coördination
of
the
sciences
the
formulation
of
the
general
and
related
principles
deduced
from
the
collection
and
orderly
arrangement
of
the
facts
of
existence
yet
man
had
rich
literatures
of
philosophy
while
his
knowledge
of
facts
was
yet
so
extremely
limited
as
hardly
to
be
worth
while
writing
books
about
none
of
the
appearances
of
man
soul
is
more
interesting
than
that
reflected
in
the
continuous
succession
of
philosophies
he
has
poured
out
let
him
who
reads
them
read
them
always
twice
first
simply
to
know
and
grasp
what
is
said
to
become
familiar
with
the
idea
as
it
formed
itself
in
the
minds
of
those
who
conceived
it
second
for
the
sake
of
figuring
the
restless
activity
of
brain
the
positive
need
of
the
mind
under
all
conditions
to
formulate
what
knowledge
it
has
or
thinks
it
has
into
some
sort
of
connected
whole
this
is
one
of
the
most
pronounced
and
permanent
features
seen
in
the
mirror
the
positive
refusal
of
the
mind
to
accept
the
isolation
of
existences
no
matter
how
far
apart
they
lie
man
proceeds
to
spin
connecting
threads
somehow
the
woven
texture
is
often
comical
enough
but
the
weaver
is
just
as
positively
revealed
in
the
cobwebs
of
ancient
philosophy
as
in
the
reasoning
of
herbert
spencer
concerning
the
literature
of
science
itself
in
strict
terms
i
should
be
very
presumptuous
to
speak
of
it
because
i
know
extremely
little
about
it
but
of
those
general
popularizations
of
it
which
we
have
in
some
of
the
works
of
haeckel
darwin
and
their
similars
i
should
say
that
beyond
the
important
information
they
contain
in
themselves
which
surely
no
one
can
afford
to
be
in
ignorance
of
they
present
the
most
transformed
reflection
of
man
which
any
literature
gives
their
words
are
cold
colorless
burdened
with
the
labor
of
exactness
machine
like
sustained
uncompromising
careless
of
effect
the
spirit
they
embody
is
like
unto
them
they
offer
the
image
of
man
soul
in
the
time
while
imagination
is
in
abeyance
reason
ascendent
this
coldness
and
quietness
sound
the
doom
of
poetry
a
people
which
shall
be
fully
permeated
with
the
spirit
and
word
of
science
will
never
conceive
great
poems
they
will
never
be
overcome
long
enough
at
a
time
by
their
wonder
and
admiration
by
their
primitive
impulses
by
their
power
of
simple
impression
to
think
or
to
speak
poetically
they
will
never
see
trees
as
impaled
giants
any
more
they
will
see
them
as
evolved
descendants
of
phytoplasm
dewdrops
are
no
more
the
jewels
of
the
fairies
they
are
the
produce
of
condensation
under
given
atmospheric
conditions
singing
stones
are
not
the
prisons
of
punished
spirits
but
problems
in
acoustics
the
basins
of
fjords
are
not
the
track
of
the
anger
of
thor
but
the
pathways
of
glaciation
the
roar
and
blaze
and
vomit
of
etna
are
not
the
rebellion
of
the
titan
but
the
explosion
of
so
and
so
many
million
cubic
feet
of
gas
the
comet
shall
no
more
be
the
herald
of
the
wrath
of
heaven
it
is
a
nebulous
body
revolving
in
an
elliptical
orbit
of
great
elongation
love
love
will
not
be
the
wound
of
cupid
but
the
manifestation
of
universal
reproductive
instincts
no
the
great
poems
of
the
world
produced
they
have
sung
their
song
and
gone
their
way
imagination
remains
to
us
but
weakened
mixed
tamed
calmed
verses
we
shall
have
and
fragments
fragments
of
beauty
and
power
but
never
again
the
of
the
mighty
early
song
we
have
the
benefits
of
science
we
must
have
its
derogations
also
the
powerful
fragments
will
be
such
as
deal
with
the
still
unexplored
regions
of
man
own
internity
if
i
may
coin
the
word
science
is
still
balking
here
but
not
for
long
we
shall
soon
have
madmen
turned
inside
out
and
their
madness
painstakingly
reduced
to
many
excessive
or
deficient
per
second
then
no
more
of
poe
raven
and
brand
i
have
said
that
i
intended
to
indicate
a
wider
concept
of
literature
than
that
generally
allowed
so
far
i
have
not
done
it
at
least
all
that
i
have
dealt
with
is
usually
mentioned
in
works
on
literature
but
i
wish
now
to
maintain
that
some
very
lowly
forms
of
written
expression
must
be
included
in
literature
always
remembering
that
i
am
seeking
the
complete
composite
of
man
soul
here
then
i
include
in
literature
beside
what
i
have
spoken
on
not
only
standard
novels
stories
sketches
travels
and
magazine
essays
of
all
sorts
but
the
poorest
paltriest
dime
novel
detective
story
daily
newspaper
report
baseball
game
account
and
splash
advertisement
oh
what
a
charming
picture
of
ourselves
we
see
therein
and
a
faithful
one
mind
you
think
what
a
speaking
likeness
of
ourselves
was
the
report
of
national
international
racial
importance
the
fight
nay
i
am
not
laughing
the
people
of
the
future
are
going
to
look
back
at
the
record
a
thousand
years
from
now
and
say
this
is
what
interested
men
in
the
year
i
wonder
which
will
appear
most
ludicrous
then
bishop
wilfred
in
juxtaposition
with
the
comet
star
or
the
destiny
of
the
white
race
put
in
jeopardy
by
a
pugilistic
contest
between
one
white
and
one
black
man
o
the
bated
breath
the
expectant
eyes
the
inbitten
lip
the
taut
muscles
the
riveted
attention
of
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
watching
the
great
scientific
combat
i
wonder
whether
the
year
will
admire
it
more
or
less
than
the
song
of
beowulf
and
the
battle
of
brunanburh
consider
the
soul
reflected
on
the
sporting
page
oh
how
mercilessly
correct
it
is
consider
the
soul
reflected
on
the
advertising
page
oh
the
consummate
liar
that
strides
across
it
oh
the
gull
the
simpleton
the
getter
of
something
for
nothing
whose
existence
it
argues
yea
commercial
man
has
set
his
image
therein
let
him
regard
himself
when
he
gets
time
and
the
body
of
our
reform
literature
which
really
reflects
the
very
best
social
aspirations
of
men
how
prodigal
in
words
it
is
how
indefinite
in
ideas
how
generous
of
brotherhood
and
sisterhood
in
the
large
how
chary
in
the
practice
do
we
not
appear
therein
as
curious
little
dwarfs
who
have
somehow
gotten
big
heads
mites
gesticulating
at
the
stars
and
imagining
they
are
afraid
because
they
twinkle
i
would
not
discourage
any
comrade
of
mine
in
the
social
struggle
but
sometimes
it
is
a
wholesome
thing
to
reconsider
our
size
a
word
in
defense
of
the
silly
story
let
us
not
forget
that
lowly
minds
have
lowly
needs
and
the
mass
of
minds
are
lowly
and
have
a
right
to
such
gratification
as
is
not
beyond
their
comprehension
so
long
as
i
do
not
to
those
stories
i
feel
quite
glad
for
the
sake
of
those
who
are
not
able
to
want
better
that
such
gratification
is
not
denied
them
i
would
not
wish
to
frown
the
silly
story
out
of
existence
so
long
as
it
is
a
veritable
expression
of
many
people
need
there
are
those
who
have
only
learned
the
art
of
reading
at
all
because
of
the
foolish
story
and
quite
in
a
side
way
i
learned
the
other
day
through
the
grave
assertion
of
a
physician
that
the
ability
to
read
even
these
whereby
some
little
refinement
of
conception
is
introduced
into
the
idea
of
love
is
one
of
the
restraining
influences
upon
sexual
degradation
common
among
poor
and
ignorant
young
women
the
face
of
man
revealed
in
them
is
therefore
not
altogether
without
charm
though
it
may
look
foolish
to
us
i
said
there
were
some
appearances
in
the
mirror
not
generally
remarked
but
which
to
me
are
suggestive
one
of
these
is
the
evident
delight
of
the
human
soul
in
in
the
older
literature
these
things
are
either
badly
set
down
as
law
and
cursing
as
occasionally
in
the
bible
or
they
are
clothed
and
mixed
with
sprightly
imaginations
as
in
the
tales
of
boccaccio
and
chaucer
or
they
are
thinly
veiled
with
a
possible
modest
meaning
as
in
the
puns
of
the
shakespearian
period
but
in
our
day
they
compose
a
subterranean
literature
of
themselves
like
segregated
harlots
among
books
should
i
say
that
i
blush
for
this
face
of
man
i
ought
to
perhaps
but
i
do
not
all
i
say
is
the
thing
is
there
a
very
real
a
very
persistent
image
in
the
glass
no
one
who
looks
straight
into
it
can
avoid
seeing
it
mixed
with
the
humorous
as
it
often
rather
usually
is
it
seems
to
be
one
of
the
normal
expressions
of
normal
men
we
deceive
ourselves
greatly
if
we
fancy
that
man
has
become
purified
of
such
imaginations
because
they
are
not
used
openly
in
modern
dramas
and
stories
as
they
were
in
the
older
ones
it
may
be
dangerous
to
say
it
but
i
believe
from
the
evidence
of
literature
as
a
whole
that
a
moderate
amount
of
amusement
in
smut
is
a
saving
balance
in
the
psychology
of
nearly
every
man
and
woman
a
sign
of
anchorage
in
a
robust
sanity
which
takes
things
as
they
are
and
laughs
at
them
i
believe
it
is
a
much
more
wholesome
appearance
than
that
betrayed
in
our
stories
and
sketches
which
deal
with
the
abnormalities
of
men
and
which
are
growing
more
and
more
in
vogue
in
spite
of
our
cry
about
realism
personally
i
am
more
interested
in
the
abnormalities
which
i
find
very
fascinating
and
i
am
very
eager
to
know
whether
they
will
prove
to
be
the
result
of
the
abnormal
conditions
of
life
which
modern
man
has
created
for
himself
in
his
tampering
with
the
forces
of
nature
his
strenuous
industrial
existence
his
turning
of
night
into
day
his
whirling
himself
over
the
world
at
a
pace
not
at
all
in
conformity
with
his
native
powers
of
locomotion
and
other
matters
in
accordance
or
will
they
prove
to
be
the
revenge
of
the
dammed
up
cribbed
cabined
and
confined
imagination
which
can
no
longer
exert
itself
upon
externals
since
the
investigating
man
has
explained
and
mastered
these
or
is
doing
so
and
now
turns
in
to
wreak
frightful
wreck
upon
the
mind
itself
at
any
rate
the
fact
is
that
we
have
some
very
curious
appearances
in
the
mirror
just
now
madmen
explaining
their
own
madness
diseased
men
picking
apart
their
own
diseases
perverted
men
analyzing
their
own
perversions
anything
everything
but
sane
and
normal
men
does
it
mean
that
in
our
day
there
is
nothing
interesting
in
good
health
in
lives
or
does
it
mean
that
the
rarest
thing
in
all
the
world
is
the
normal
man
whom
tacit
consent
assumes
to
be
the
commonest
that
everybody
while
outwardly
wearing
a
mask
of
reputable
common
sense
is
within
a
raging
conglomeration
of
psychic
elements
that
hurl
themselves
on
one
another
like
hissing
flames
or
does
it
mean
simply
that
the
most
powerful
writers
are
themselves
diseased
and
can
only
paint
disease
i
put
these
questions
and
do
not
presume
to
answer
them
i
point
to
the
mirror
the
ibsen
drama
the
andreyev
story
the
maeterlinck
poem
the
artzibashev
novel
and
i
say
the
image
is
there
explain
it
as
you
can
for
the
rest
let
me
recall
to
you
what
i
told
you
was
my
intent
first
to
insist
on
a
more
inclusive
view
of
literature
you
see
i
would
have
it
extended
both
up
and
down
even
to
the
advertisement
the
sporting
page
and
the
surreptitious
anecdote
to
the
fullest
and
most
comprehensive
statements
of
the
works
of
reason
second
to
suggest
that
readers
acquire
the
habit
of
reading
twice
or
at
least
with
a
double
intent
when
serious
literature
is
to
be
considered
i
would
insist
on
actually
reading
twice
but
of
course
it
would
be
both
impractical
and
undesirable
to
apply
such
a
method
to
most
of
the
print
we
look
at
those
who
are
confirmed
in
the
habits
of
critics
will
have
the
greatest
trouble
in
learning
to
read
a
book
from
the
simple
standpoint
and
yet
no
one
can
ever
form
a
genuine
appreciation
of
a
work
who
has
not
first
forgotten
that
he
is
a
critic
and
allowed
himself
to
be
carried
away
into
the
events
and
personalities
depicted
therein
in
that

reading
also
one
should
train
himself
to
feel
and
hear
the
music
of
language
this
great
instrument
which
men
have
jointly
built
and
out
of
which
come
great
organ
tones
and
trumpet
calls
and
thin
flute
notes
sweeping
and
wailing
an
articulate
storm
a
conjuring
key
whereby
all
the
passions
of
the
dead
the
millions
of
the
dead
have
given
to
the
living
the
power
to
call
their
ghosts
out
of
the
grave
and
make
them
walk
yea
every
word
is
the
mystic
embodiment
of
a
thousand
years
of
vanished
passion
hope
desire

all
that
battled
through
the

figures
turned
to

your
ears
to
hear
the
song
of
it
it
helps
to
feel
what
the
writer
felt
and
after
that
read
critically
with
one
eye
on
the
page
so
to
speak
and
the
other
on
the
reflection
in
the
mirror
looking
for
the
mind
behind
the
work
the
things
which
interested
the
author
and
those
he
wrote
for
third
to
suggest
inquiry
into
the
curious
paradox
of
the
people
of
the
most
highly
evolved
scientific
and
mechanical
age
taking
especial
delight
in
psychic
abnormalities
and
morbidities
whereby
the
most
utterly
unreasonable
fictive
creation
becomes
the
greatest
center
of
curiosity
and
attraction
to
the
children
of
reason
a
mirror
maze
is
literature
wherein
man
sees
all
faces
of
himself
lengthened
here
widened
there
distorted
in
another
place
restored
again
to
due
proportion
with
every
possible
expression
on
his
face
from
abjectness
to
heroic
daring
from
starting
terror
to
icy
courage
from
love
to
hate
and
back
again
to
worship
from
the
almost
sublime
down
to
the
altogether
grotesque
now
giant
now
dwarf
but
always
with
one
persistent
character
his
curiosity
to
see
the
drama
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
passions
of
men
are
actors
events
are
their
motions
all
history
is
their
speech
in
the
long
play
of
the
ages
a
human
being
sometimes
becomes
an
event
a
nation
passion
takes
a
such
beings
are
the
expression
of
the
gathered
of
millions
he
only
who
keeps
himself
aloof
from
all
feeling
can
remain
the
spectator
of
the
hour
all
that
humanity
which
is
held
within
the
beating
coiling
surging
tides
of
passion
has
no
individuality
it
sinks
its
personality
to
become
a
vein
in
the
limb
of
this
giant
a
pulse
in
the
heart
of
that
titan
only
when
out
of
the
spirit
of
the
times
the
event
is
born
only
when
the
act
is
complete
the
curtain
rung
down
only
then
does
the
intellectuality
of
the
vein
the
pulse
rise
to
the
level
of
the
dispassionate
only
then
can
it
survey
a
tragedy
and
say
this
was
necessary
a
reaction
and
say
this
was
inevitable
yet
as
a
drop
of
blood
is
a
quivering
living
flashing
ruby
beside
the
dead
pale
pearl
of
a
stagnant
pool
so
is
one
drop
of
feeling
a
shining
thing
a
living
thing
beside
the
deadness
of
the
intellect
which
judges
while
the
heart
is
stone
beside
those
quiet
bayous
of
brain
which
reflect
back
the
images
before
them
very
purely
very
stilly
giving
no
heed
to
the
great
rushing
river
of
heart
that
rolls
on
hurries
on
so
close
beside
them
bye
and
bye
bye
and
bye
the
river
reaches
the
grand
great
sea
and
the
waters
spread
out
calm
and
deep
so
deep
that
the
stars
of
the
upper
sea
the
lights
of
the
higher
life
shine
far
up
from
them
as
a
babe
smiles
up
into
its
mother
eyes
and
up
still
to
the
distant
source
of
the
light
within
the
eyes
it
is
to
men
and
women
of
feeling
that
i
speak
men
and
women
of
the
millions
men
and
women
in
the
hurrying
current
not
to
the
shallow
egotist
who
holds
himself
apart
and
with
the
phariseeism
of
intellectuality
exclaims
i
am
more
just
than
thou
but
to
those
whose
every
fiber
of
being
is
vibrating
with
emotion
as
aspen
leaves
quiver
in
the
breath
of
storm
to
those
whose
hearts
swell
with
a
great
pity
at
the
pitiful
toil
of
women
the
weariness
of
young
children
the
handcuffed
helplessness
of
strong
men
to
those
whose
blood
runs
quick
along
the
veins
like
on
the
dry
grass
of
prairies
when
the
wind
whirls
aside
the
smokings
of
the
holocaust
and
courting
the
teeth
of
the
flame
the
black
priestess
injustice
beckons
it
on
while
her
feet
stamp
on
the
cinders
of
the
sacrifice
to
those
whose
thrill
at
the
touch
of
love
like
the
sweet
low
musical
laugh
of
childhood
or
thrum
with
hate
like
the
singing
vibration
of
the
bowstring
speeding
the
arrow
of
death
i
speak
to
those
whose
eyes
behold
all
things
through
a
haze
of
gray
or
rose
or
gold
born
of
their
surroundings
and
which
mist
slips
away
only
when
the
gaze
is
leveled
on
that
dead
past
whose
passions
and
whose
deeds
are
ended
to
whom
the
present
is
always
a
morning
with
the
dimness
of
morning
around
it
the
past
clear
and
still
no
veil
on
its
face
for
the
veil
has
been
shredded
asunder
for
he
only
who
intensely
perceives
the
nature
of
his
surroundings
he
and
he
only
who
has
felt
and
keenly
felt
all
the
throbs
and
throes
of
life
can
judge
with
any
degree
of
truth
of
the
action
of
that
which
is
past
you
you
who
have
loved
you
who
have
joyed
you
who
have
suffered
it
belongs
to
you
to
people
the
silent
streets
of
the
silent
cities
with
forms
now
vanished
to
comprehend
something
of
the
passions
which
animated
their
action
it
belongs
to
you
to
understand
how
the
fury
of
a
great
energy
striking
terrible
aimless
blows
in
the
dark
may
yet
across
the
chasm
of
awful
mistake
touch
the
hand
of
a
greater
justice
if
from
a
panoramic
survey
of
the
past
some
wisdom
may
be
gathered
then
let
the
dramas
of
old
ages
tell
us
what
have
been
the
mainsprings
of
their
motions
so
we
shall
understand
what
action
ushered
in
the
drama
of
the
nineteenth
century
westward
the
star
of
empire
holds
its
way
following
the
course
of
those
majestic
spheres
of
fire
which
whirl
each
in
its
vast
ellipse
trending
away
in
a
long
southwesterly
path
athwart
the
heavens
obedient
to
that
superior
attraction
which
through
all
the
universe
holds
good
the
attraction
of
greater
for
lesser
things
the
tide
of
life
upon
our
world
has
risen
and
swelled
and
rolled
away
to
the
south
and
west
away
in
the
orient
source
of
the
sunlight
away
where
the
glitter
of
ice
shines
up
to
meet
the
morning
nations
have
risen
and
plunged
down
impetuously
over
the
sleeping
regions
of
darkness
and
of
heat
bearing
with
them
the
life
of
the
north
and
the
light
of
the
east
and
out
of
this
conquered
earth
have
arisen
the
mixed
passions
of
another
life
and
another
race
still
the
governing
stars
wheel
on
and
the
tide
of
life
which
paused
only
to
gather
strength
rolls
up
again
and
once
more
a
nation
is
born
and
new
passions
dictate
the
action
of
the
peoples
down
down
it
sweeps
over
the
altaian
hills
over
the
himalayan
ranges
over
the
land
of
the
euphrates
and
tigris
over
the
deserts
of
arabia
the
barren
the
fields
of
arabia
the
stony
and
the
grasses
and
waters
of
arabia
the
happy
to
those
low
shores
the
home
of
dark
mausoleums
and
darker
pyramids
on
to
the
now
classic
land
of
greece
and
golden
italy
and
the
home
of
the
moors
sweeps
till
it
touches
the
frothing
sea
and
brightly
borne
upon
its
upper
crest
shines
the
glory
the
splendor
the
magnificence
of
the
warring
powers
which
dictated
the
action
of
greece
and
rome
for
centuries
their
hoisted
spears
send
back
the
burnished
glitter
of
the
sun
and
then
the
light
dies
out
down
rushing
from
the
again
the
tide
of
vigor
pours
and
the
health
and
strength
of
barbarism
conquers
the
weakness
of
a
tottering
civilization
far
away
away
over
the
miles
of
sparkling
sea
in
the
darkness
and
the
silence
a
continent
lies
waiting
waiting
for
the
coming
of
the
light
waiting
for
the
swelling
of
the
tide
slowly
at
last
a
ripple
creeps
up
over
the
strange
beach
and
the
flood
rolls
on
and
again
a
continent
becomes
a
cradle
and
the
empire
star
sends
on
its
rays
to
kiss
the
forehead
of
the
rising
world
over
the
breadth
of
all
our
continent
that
mighty
wave
is
flowing
still
standing
almost
upon
the
threshold
of
another
world
and
looking
back
down
this
past
gradually
there
dawns
upon
reflection
vision
gradually
there
grows
out
of
the
confusion
of
forms
and
the
babel
of
sounds
a
clearer
perception
of
the
motor
powers
which
have
dictated
the
action
of
this
past
a
better
idea
of
the
grand
plot
which
driven
by
these
motor
powers
the
passions
are
working
out
for
above
the
long
procession
of
scenes
and
events
above
the
monster
massings
of
happiness
and
woe
above
the
war
and
peace
of
centuries
above
the
nations
that
have
risen
and
fallen
above
the
life
and
above
the
grave
the
winged
and
shadowy
embodiments
of
two
great
ideas
float
and
rest
and
those
two
principles
are
called
authority
and
liberty
or
if
it
please
you
better
and
liberty
the
one
is
all
clad
in
the
purple
and
scarlet
of
pomp
and
of
power
while
the
other
stands
a
glorious
shining
center
in
the
white
radiance
of
freedom
yet
not
always
far
back
in
time
authority
stood
on
thrones
and
altars
with
the
plumed
sables
of
despotism
waving
on
his
brow
while
in
his
hands
he
held
two
iron
gyves
the
one
to
fetter
thought
the
other
to
fetter
action
and
these
two
gyves
were
called
church
and
liberty
ah
liberty
was
then
a
name
scarcely
to
pass
the
lips
dreamed
of
only
in
solitude
spoken
of
only
in
dungeons
yet
out
of
the
blackest
mire
the
whitest
lily
blooms
out
of
the
dungeon
out
of
the
sorrow
out
of
the
sacrifice
out
of
the
pain
grew
this
child
of
the
heart
and
pure
and
strong
she
grew
until
the
sabled
plumes
have
tottered
on
the
despot
brow
and
a
great
palsy
shakes
the
hands
that
once
so
firmly
held
the
gyves
of
church
and
state
for
ever
seeking
to
overthrow
each
other
the
one
for
the
aggrandizement
of
self
the
other
for
the
love
of
all
mankind
these
two
powers
have
contended
and
every
energy
every
passion
every
desire
good
or
evil
has
been
ranged
on
this
side
or
on
that
blunderingly
or
wisely
and
nations
have
swung
to
and
fro
in
their
breath
as
upon
a
hinge
and
one
by
one
the
powers
of
authority
have
been
crippled
and
step
by
step
liberty
has
advanced
until
mankind
is
beginning
to
measure
the
forces
that
struggling
blindly
together
are
yet
evolving
light
to
drink
in
the
sublime
ideal
of
freedom
yet
oh
how
long
the
struggle
with
vested
ignorance
with
greed
in
power
when
upon
the
drama
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
curtain
rose
liberty
triumphant
on
the
younger
shores
lay
prone
and
hurled
in
europe
against
fifteen
centuries
of
crowned
and
throned
and
tithed
curse
and
woe
unutterable
she
had
risen
with
such
a
fearful
convulsive
strength
that
when
she
had
mown
down
king
priest
and
throne
and
gorged
the
guillotine
with
blood
she
sank
back
exhausted
from
the
struggle
and
the
hated
tyrant
rose
again
the
wild
desire
to
conquer
to
possess
to
control
to
hold
in
subjection
seemed
to
dominate
with
an
unconquerable
strength
and
the
gathered
of
millions
of
people
wrought
itself
into
the
single
brain
of
napoleon
bonaparte
this
human
being
became
an
event
this
nation
passion
took
a
the
spirit
of
the
times
produced
this
man
and
authority
smiled
as
one
after
another
the
despots
of
europe
plotted
and
planned
only
to
be
overthrown
by
this
incarnation
of
ambition
while
the
scenes
were
shifted
from
the
to
the
from
the
to
the
and
through
them
all
the
great
event
glowed
out
lit
high
by
the
light
how
well
the
plot
was
working
the
empire
triumphant
nations
subjected
the
fetter
of
action
closing
its
terrible
teeth
liberty
manacled
on
the
left
the
armies
of
god
massing
their
forces
advancing
preparing
to
close
down
the
iron
jaw
of
the
iron
gyve
upon
the
right
to
imprison
thought
to
the
union
of
fetters
to
link
up
the
broken
chains
to
burden
human
hope
and
human
will
and
human
life
once
more
with
the
awful
oppression
of
church
and
state
but
liberty
will
not
can
not
die
wounded
and
bruised
and
pinioned
sore
condemned
to
the
use
of
instruments
that
were
none
of
hers
she
wrought
with
england
jealousy
with
wellington
emulation
with
fear
with
love
with
hate
impelled
by
one
motive
or
another
the
nations
of
the
coalition
moved
in
concert
napoleon
had
been
marengo
he
had
been
austerlitz
he
became
and
when
across
that
awful
field
rolled
the
last
long
cannon
boom
when
the
silence
settled
when
the
quick
and
the
dead
lay
sleeping
and
the
wounded
died
justice
and
suffering
touched
hands
across
the
gulf
of
blood
and
liberty
heard
them
whisper
sic
semper
tyrannis
in
the
tableau
that
followed
she
the
ideal
of
our
dreams
still
stood
pale
and
fettered
but
a
smile
lit
up
her
face
and
a
light
gleamed
in
her
eyes
as
she
saw
authority
reel
and
stagger
from
the
blow
which
though
it
did
not
sever
yet
shattered
half
the
strength
of
both
its
fetters
for
the
strength
of
god
lies
in
a
vast
unity
an
ownership
of
ideas
backed
up
by
the
brute
force
under
the
command
of
the
individual
in
whom
that
ownership
of
ideas
is
vested
while
the
strength
of
liberty
lies
in
the
very
essence
of
things
themselves
the
fact
that
no
law
or
force
ever
destroy
the
individualities
of
existence
and
of
necessity
the
natural
tendency
to
break
all
bonds
which
seek
to
control
thought
and
all
force
which
locks
up
those
bonds
entailing
liberty
of
action
as
the
outcome
of
liberty
of
thought
and
just
in
proportion
as
churches
have
been
dismembered
and
states
have
been
broken
up
no
matter
that
each
new
church
and
each
new
state
were
but
another
form
of
despotism
just
in
that
proportion
has
the
principle
of
liberty
been
served
for
each
new
religious
establishment
has
been
an
assertion
of
the
right
to
think
differently
from
the
fashionable
creed
each
change
has
been
a
movement
away
from
the
centralization
of
power
so
with
waterloo
in
the
background
with
authority
lashed
to
impotent
rage
before
it
and
liberty
pinioned
yet
with
the
lit
smile
still
upon
her
countenance
the
tableau
light
flames
up
and
dies
and
the
curtain
falls
upon
the
first
great
act
those
who
think
those
who
feel
those
who
hope
know
why
that
smile
was
there
for
looking
away
over
the
long
blue
roll
of
water
that
swelled
like
an
interlude
between
she
beheld
the
sublime
opening
scene
of
the
act
that
followed
far
up
the
wonderful
stage
the
distant
mountains
lift
their
circling
crests
at
their
feet
the
waters
sweep
like
a
march
of
music
vast
acres
of
untrodden
shower
their
emerald
wealth
nearer
the
front
the
lower
hills
rise
up
and
then
the
short
atlantic
slope
all
rife
with
busy
life
bends
down
to
meet
the
sea
on
the
right
the
sheens
and
shines
on
the
majestic
northern
forests
while
the
glittering
earth
dipped
in
its
bath
of
frozen
crystal
spreads
like
a
field
of
diamonds
on
the
left
the
white
flakes
of
the
orange
bloom
fall
like
a
shimmering
bridal
veil
the
wind
floats
up
like
a
perfume
and
the
hazy
lazy
languor
of
warmth
creeps
all
about
behind
it
all
behind
the
hills
and
the
prairies
and
the
lifted
summits
the
mystical
golden
light
of
the
west
drops
down
filling
the
distance
with
the
glory
of
promise
the
silver
light
of
the
empire
star
glides
over
the
atlantic
slope
and
its
rays
like
guiding
fingers
point
onward
to
the
gathering
shadows
now
the
passions
of
men
begin
to
move
upon
this
vast
platform
with
an
energy
never
before
witnessed
diverted
from
their
channels
of
struggle
against
the
oppression
of
gods
and
kings
and
the
bitterness
of
with
a
freedom
of
opportunity
denied
in
the
old
world
and
with
such
unstinted
natural
resources
waiting
for
the
magic
transformer
the
genius
of
humanity
ambition
of
power
avarice
pride
jealousy
all
those
motors
born
out
of
the
old
of
a
god
bred
and
multiplied
through
generations
till
they
have
come
to
be
looked
upon
as
natural
laws
of
human
existence
begin
to
work
together
to
plant
this
untrodden
earth
to
sow
in
its
furrows
the
seed
of
a
newer
race
and
paradoxical
as
it
may
sound
to
work
for
their
own
destruction
their
final
elimination
from
the
human
brain
or
perhaps
it
were
more
correct
to
say
that
with
the
barriers
of
old
institutions
taken
away
they
naturally
begin
their
retransformation
into
those
beautiful
sentiments
from
which
they
were
originally
warped
distorted
misshapen
by
that
warped
distorted
misshapen
idea
called
god
so
do
they
inaugurate
the
grand
era
of
development
so
do
they
answer
the
question
what
incentive
would
there
be
for
labor
or
genius
if
the
institutions
that
compel
them
to
struggle
were
broken
down
look
at
the
stage
of
the
past
and
see
never
before
had
thought
been
so
free
never
before
had
ability
been
less
cramped
less
starved
or
less
compelled
and
never
before
did
genius
dare
so
much
for
purposes
so
great
never
before
did
the
engines
which
drive
the
tide
of
life
along
a
continent
send
forth
a
stream
of
so
much
vigor
a
new
light
breaks
along
the
pathway
of
the
stars
and
swells
and
rolls
and
floods
the
great
scene
with
a
so
magnificent
that
the
very
hills
blush
in
its
rising
splendor
it
is
the
dawn
which
the
night
of
god
so
long
held
shrouded
it
is
that
which
is
born
when
superstition
dies
it
is
that
phoenix
which
rises
from
the
ashes
of
religion
it
is
that
clear
blent
flame
of
all
the
great
forces
of
nature
brought
to
the
knowledge
of
mankind
by
delving
reason
and
shot
like
northern
streamers
from
the
heart
of
her
the
church
of
god
so
long
held
throttled
science
it
is
that
which
shone
reflected
in
the
eyes
of
liberty
when
pale
and
manacled
she
stood
before
the
field
of
waterloo
the
ray
of
the
under
earth
came
up
to
join
the
ray
of
the
clouds
shot
down
the
energies
of
sky
and
mine
and
sea
were
clasped
to
bring
down
the
wealth
of
the
mountains
to
the
shore
and
to
transport
the
life
of
the
now
populous
strip
of
slope
to
the
unclaimed
regions
of
the
west
in
the
broad
blaze
of
light
the
scene
is
shifted
the
golden
effulgence
melts
and
flows
round
that
kingdom
where
quietly
but
surely
the
two
great
engines
of
authority
are
being
shriven
apart
the
dynasties
of
kings
are
growing
dusty
much
of
their
power
is
but
a
legend
the
church
is
shrinking
in
her
garments
the
desires
of
this
people
are
slow
to
move
but
deeply
rooted
and
strong
and
so
far
as
they
have
moved
forward
they
have
never
moved
back
there
have
been
no
gigantic
strides
no
reactions
little
by
little
the
idea
of
power
has
been
crippled
till
the
english
bishop
and
the
english
lord
have
become
mere
titled
mockeries
in
comparison
with
their
ancient
feudal
meaning
but
stop
close
lying
there
almost
beneath
her
stretching
shadows
another
island
flashes
like
a
green
star
in
its
setting
and
from
that
island
there
rises
up
the
cry
of
a
great
devotion
clinging
blindly
to
its
greatest
curse
its
god
while
persecuted
even
unto
death
by
the
fanaticism
of
another
faith
and
the
pleading
of
hunger
while
day
long
and
night
long
the
shuttle
flies
in
the
flax
loom
and
the
earth
yields
her
golden
fruition
only
to
lade
the
ships
that
bear
it
away
from
the
lips
and
the
hands
that
produced
it
blindly
devotion
prays
to
its
god
that
god
whom
it
calls
and
and
the
english
lord
who
can
not
thus
subdue
his
own
countrymen
reaches
out
the
long
arm
of
the
law
across
the
channel
for
his
rent
and
with
god
looking
on
it
is
given
and
still
while
the
women
kneel
at
the
altar
for
help
the
scene
widens
out
and
away
in
the
distance
the
city
lifts
up
from
the
sea
and
from
the
dome
of
the
vatican
from
that
great
mortared
hill
of
god
the
vicar
of
christ
calls
out
my
tribute
my
peter
pence
and
with
god
looking
on
it
is
given
and
then
from
the
foot
of
that
altar
where
so
many
lips
of
woe
have
pressed
where
so
many
helpless
hands
have
clasped
where
so
many
hearts
have
broken
comes
the
ironical
promise
of
jehovah
ask
and
thou
shalt
receive
oh
god
is
a
very
promising
personage
indeed
very
promising
but
like
some
of
his
disciples
very
poor
pay
liberty
shadowed
invisible
yet
a
muffled
voice
is
repeating
the
words
which
not
so
long
ago
rang
from
the
lips
of
one
who
stood
almost
beneath
the
shadow
of
the
scaffold
who
walks
in
prison
gloom
ye
see
me
only
in
your
cells
ye
see
me
only
in
the
grave
ye
see
me
only
lone
beside
the
exile
sullen
wave
ye
fools
do
i
not
also
live
where
you
have
sought
to
pierce
in
vain
rests
not
a
nook
for
me
to
dwell
in
every
heart
in
every
brain
not
every
brow
that
boldly
thinks
erect
with
manhood
honest
pride
does
not
each
bosom
shelter
me
that
beats
with
honor
generous
tide
not
every
workshop
brooding
woe
not
every
hut
that
harbors
grief
ha
am
i
not
the
breath
of

that
pants
and
struggles
for
relief
ah
poor
panting
struggling
ireland
how
god
laughs
with
glee
to
see
his
shackles
weight
your
misery
the
scene
is
shifting
the
stage
is
a
strange
eclipse
obscures
the
shafted
light
darker
darker
now
a
low
red
fire
gleams
like
a
winking
eye
along
the
foreground
it
runs
it
hisses
like
a
snake
there
another
leaps
up
there
another
france
germany
italy
the
continent
blazes
with
the
fires
of
the
commune
that
spirit
which
drunken
with
blood
reeled
from
the
guillotine
at
to
be
crushed
beneath
the
upbuilding
of
the
empire
has
once
more
arisen
and
out
of
the
hot
hells
of
fury
and
jealousy
and
hate
out
of
the
pitiless
struggle
between
vested
rights
and
wrongs
with
high
ancestral
lineage
and
the
great
outcrying
of
a
piteous
ignorance
against
an
oppression
whose
injustice
it
feels
but
can
not
analyze
grows
the
sublime
idea
which
priests
have
anathematized
and
states
have
outlawed
the
sacred
dogma
of
in
so
far
as
that
ideal
was
made
possible
of
conception
in
so
far
as
the
masses
began
to
understand
something
of
the
causes
of
their
ills
in
so
far
the
purpose
of
liberty
was
served
no
matter
that
the
arms
of
oppression
were
triumphant
the
dawn
of
the
thought
of
equal
liberty
upon
the
mass
of
the
unthinking
was
a
far
greater
victory
than
any
triumph
of
arms
so
when
the
fires
died
down
and
the
low
reflection
gleamed
for
an
instant
over
those
quiescent
indian
valleys
and
altaian
ranges
where
the
main
plot
of
old
centuries
had
been
laid
and
then
paled
out
before
the
white
flare
lighting
the
tableau
of
the
second
act
liberty
stood
with
chained
hands
lifted
toward
her
enemy
while
a
proud
look
playing
like
an
iridescent
flame
in
her
eyes
said
plain
as
lips
could
speak
it
i
have
unbound
their
thoughts
they
will
one
day
unbind
my
hands
slowly
the
curtain
falls
on
the
fair
prisoner
and
the
glowering
god
the
solemn
ocean
interlude
rolls
in
again
again
the
rising
curtain
shows
the
curving
slope
the
of
hills
the
wide
green
valley
with
its
threading
silver
the
sweeping
mountains
with
the
mirage
of
the
blue
pacific
lifted
high
in
the
sky
behind
them
the
frosted
pines
the
orange
groves
moving
upon
the
nearer
stage
two
great
masses
of
humanity
are
seen
facing
each
other
the
fires
of
ambition
of
stubborn
pride
of
determination
for
the
mastery
flash
like
in
the
eyes
of
both
rage
is
gathering
as
the
darkens
yet
these
two
opposing
forces
are
not
all
from
under
the
groves
of
bridal
bloom
comes
a
mournful
requiem
under
the
bloom
four
million
voices
cry
in
pain
upon
the
darkened
faces
upturned
to
that
darkening
day
fall
the
white
petals
helplessly
as
hope
falls
on
the
faces
of
the
dead
to
die
beside
them
in
the
beautiful
land
of
the
sun
four
million
human
beings
clank
the
chains
of
the
chattel
slave
ah
what
music
liberty
liberty
was
a
wraith
fleeting
through
the
lonely
terrible
of
the
quagmire
strange
mystical
vanishing
on
the
darkly
ominous
waters
lying
so
silent
so
level
beneath
the
droop
of
spanish
moss
and
cypress
there
it
was
they
drove
thee
where
the
quaking
earth
shivered
with
its
branded
burden
where
the
fever
and
the
miasm
were
thy
breathing
and
thy
sacred
eyes
were
dimmed
with
of
mist
that
floated
o
so
dankly
o
so
coldly
a
steam
of
tears
that
rose
as
fast
as
their
dews
might
fall
there
wast
thou
exiled
thou
the
thou
the
the
yet
oh
so
dear
men
love
thee
liberty
that
even
here
in
thy
last
terrible
citadel
of
woe
humanity
linked
arms
with
death
and
wooed
thee
still
wooed
thee
with
the
ringing
bay
of
bloodhounds
in
its
ears
wooed
thee
with
the
wolf
of
hunger
gnawing
at
its
throat
wooed
thee
with
the
clinging
miasm
winding
its
anacondine
folds
around
its
body
wooed
thee
with
the
dark
pathos
of
a
dying
eye
while
the
diseased
and
hungered
limbs
lay
stiffening
in
their
agony
and
thou
wast
true
o
liberty
out
of
thy
bitter
exile
thou
didst
call
to
them
and
point
them
on
to
hope
and
thou
didst
call
too
to
those
dreamers
whose
faces
shone
amidst
the
rank
and
file
of
those
dominated
by
local
hate
alone
as
shines
a
clear
star
among
driving
clouds
against
them
authority
has
hurled
his
curses
spit
upon
by
the
godly
despised
by
the
law
abiding
they
yet
have
dared
to
say
to
church
and
law
think
what
you
please
of
me
but
free
the
slave
aye
the
church
persecuted
and
the
law
hunted
down
and
for
the
love
of
god
men
set
traps
to
catch
their
even
the
wise
men
the
wise
men
at
washington
against
whose
mandates
it
is
treason
to
speak
aye
a
matter
for
the
scaffold
in
these
days
even
the
wise
men
built
a
trap
to
uphold
the
divine
institution
and
sent
it
forth
to
the
people
labelled
the
fugitive
slave
law
and
as
in
other
days
human
beings
died
for
their
opinions
the
opinions
did
not
has
not
one
of
our
martyrs
said
men
die
but
principles
live
see
the
light
which
has
been
slowly
fading
from
the
right
and
left
shines
with
a
frightful
brilliancy
upon
one
point
north
and
south
lie
darkened
but
harper
ferry
glows
there
is
a
wild
mad
charge
a
shifting
of
the
light
a
scaffold
a
doomed
old
man
bending
his
grand
white
head
to
mount
the
fatal
steps
with
a
kiss
yet
warm
upon
his
lips
and
then
only
a
dull
lifeless
pendulum
in
human
form
swinging
to
and
fro
and
the
church
and
the
law
were
satisfied
when
those
dumb
lips
were
cold
and
the
dead
limbs
were
stiff
and
god
and
harper
ferry
had
no
more
to
fear
from
old
john
brown
but
the
church
and
the
law
have
not
always
been
wise
they
have
not
always
understood
that
the
martyrs
creed
and
code
have
done
as
much
by
their
death
for
the
propagation
of
their
principles
as
the
martyrs
creed
and
code
and
god
and
the
state
sowed
a
wind
whose
reaping
was
a
terrible
whirlwind
when
they
hung
john
brown
across
the
dim
platform
the
passions
of
hate
and
pride
move
toward
each
other
it
is
the
old
combat
of
the
forces
of
authority
each
contending
not
for
the
vindication
of
right
but
for
the
maintenance
of
power
over
the
other
it
is
a
terrific
struggle
of
brute
strength
and
strategy
and
cunning
and
ferocity
and
well
might
those
who
conceived
the
ideal
beautiful
of
freedom
shrink
from
the
path
their
feet
must
tread
to
reach
it
not
strange
if
some
should
pause
and
shudder
and
cry
out
is
it
worth
the
sacrifice
but
up
from
the
dust
where
hope
lay
trodden
and
out
of
the
trenches
where
the
sacrificed
lay
hid
and
over
the
plains
all
scarred
with
bullets
and
plowed
with
shells
breathed
the
whisper
it
is
not
vain
it
was
not
in
vain
for
as
at
waterloo
the
struggle
of
ambition
against
ambition
defeated
the
first
purpose
of
authority
the
centralization
of
power
and
gave
a
partial
victory
to
her
whom
both
hated
so
antietam
fredericksburg
vicksburg
gettysburg
while
in
themselves
representing
only
the
brutish
struggle
of
opposition
based
on
the
desire
to
domineer
really
wrought
out
the
victory
of
that
ideal
which
dwelt
in
the
minds
of
those
anathematized
by
god
and
outlawed
by
the
state
for
when
the
hot
lips
of
the
iron
mouths
grew
cold
liberty
forsook
her
lonely
fastness
came
forth
upon
the
desolated
plain
and
mounting
still
to
the
summits
of
the
hills
looked
away
over
the
ruined
homes
the
depopulated
cities
the
faces
and
though
her
tears
fell
fast
an
ineffable
tenderness
shone
upon
her
features
as
the
torrent
of
pale
light
flowed
round
her
form
defining
its
in
relief
against
the
sable
of
four
million
freedmen
smiling
their
stricken
chains
swiftly
following
the
tableau
fire
comes
the
eastern
scene
where
in
the
very
center
of
its
power
the
church
is
shaken
by
an
invader
and
garibaldi
becomes
the
of
the
event
then
follows
the
conclave
of
the
vatican
where
by
that
singular
logic
known
to
the
roman
church
the
vote
of
fallible
beings
renders
the
pope
infallible
upon
the
heels
of
this
the
breaking
of
that
strong
tooth
of
the
church
in
the
expulsion
of
the
order
of
the
society
of
jesus
by
the
german
reichstag
and
the
overthrow
of
kingcraft
in
france
the
curtain
falls
behind
the
scene
is
being
prepared
for
the
last
great
act
and
now
in
the
interval
of
waiting
let
us
think
so
far
we
have
been
surveying
the
completed
while
we
can
understand
something
of
the
passions
which
animated
this
past
can
feel
something
of
the
pulsations
which
throbbed
in
its
arteries
flowed
in
its
veins
we
yet
can
speak
of
it
without
emotion
either
upon
one
side
or
the
other
the
river
of
heart
has
reached
the
sea
the
troubled
waters
have
spread
out
deep
and
up
from
their
depths
shine
the
still
reflections
of
those
great
lights
which
gilt
the
stages
of
the
past
calmly
now
we
can
look
at
the
reaction
from
the
french
revolution
to
the
empire
and
say
this
was
inevitable
of
napoleon
fall
this
was
necessary
of
the
awakening
of
science
this
was
a
natural
result
of
the
uprising
of
this
was
the
premature
birth
of
an
idea
forced
upon
the
people
by
the
oppression
of
authority
we
can
forget
the
choking
agony
of
john
brown
and
declare
his
death
a
victory
we
can
look
upon
the
awful
waste
of
blood
in
the
civil
war
and
say
it
was
pitiful
but
the
goblet
of
woe
must
needs
have
been
spilled
full
of
red
life
wine
ere
the
hoarse
and
hollow
throat
of
tyranny
were
satisfied
we
can
see
where
each
of
the
contending
principles
has
lost
and
gained
and
measuring
the
sum
totals
against
each
other
decide
that
the
old
despotism
is
losing
ground
that
instead
of
the
supreme
authority
of
god
the
supreme
sovereignty
of
the
individual
is
the
growing
idea
but
now
we
have
come
to
a
stage
where
we
can
no
longer
be
cool
spectators
in
what
happens
now
we
too
must
be
part
and
parcel
of
the
action
we
too
must
hope
and
toil
and
struggle
and
suffer
we
are
no
longer
looking
through
the
clear
still
atmosphere
of
the
dead
around
our
forms
the
wheeling
mists
are
circled
and
before
our
eyes
the
haze
lies
thick
the
haze
of
gold
or
the
haze
of
gray
the
dimness
of
the
yet
to
be
befogs
our
sight
and
the
rush
of
hope
and
fear
blinds
all
our
faculties
you
who
stand
well
upon
the
heights
of
love
of
comfort
of
happiness
heeding
not
the
darkness
and
the
sorrow
beneath
you
behold
with
eyes
the
great
figures
of
god
and
freedom
wound
about
showered
with
light
to
you
there
is
no
menace
in
their
darting
eyes
there
is
no
purpose
in
their
statures
there
is
no
jarring
in
their
clarion
voices
no
for
your
senses
are
stupid
in
your
luxury
your
brains
are
dulled
too
dulled
to
think
your
ears
are
glutted
with
the
ring
of
gold
in
your
vain
and
foolish
hearts
you
dream
that
what
you
see
there
is
a
shadowy
bridal
that
there
at
last
religion
and
science
statecraft
and
freedom
are
meeting
to
embrace
each
other
ah
go
on
doctors
and
lawyers
and
preachers
and
teachers
go
on
talking
your
incompatibilities
go
on
teaching
your
absurdities
dream
out
your
dream
at
your
feet
beneath
the
shadow
of
your
capitols
and
domes
under
the
tuition
of
your
literature
from
out
your
chaos
of
lies
from
before
your
pulpits
your
rostrums
and
your
seats
of
learning
something
is
growing
something
that
is
looking
in
the
eyes
that
is
analyzing
your
statements
that
is
revolving
your
institutions
in
its
brain
that
is
crushing
your
sophistries
in
its
merciless
machinery
as
fine
as
grain
is
ground
between
the
whitened
freethought
is
looking
at
you
gentlemen
more
than
that
it
questions
you
it
puts
you
on
the
it
you
it
says
do
you
believe
in
god
and
you
answer
yes
do
you
believe
him
to
be
omnipotent
omniscient
and
certainly
less
than
this
would
not
be
god
then
you
believe
he
has
the
power
to
order
all
things
as
he
wills
and
being
he
wills
all
things
according
to
justice
yes
then
you
believe
him
to
be
the
father
of
all
his
created
children
yes
and
each
one
of
those
children
has
an
equal
right
to
life
and
liberty
yes
then
look
upon
this
earth
beneath
you
this
earth
of
beings
whose
lives
are
of
so
poor
account
to
you
and
tell
us
where
god
and
is
he
doing
everyone
has
a
right
to
life
what
mockery
when
the
control
of
the
necessaries
of
life
is
given
to
the
few
by
the
state
and
above
the
seal
of
the
law
the
priest
has
set
the
seal
of
the
church
verily
you
do
take
my
life
when
you
take
that
whereby
i
live
is
this
your
divine
justice
what
irony
to
tell
me
i
am
free
if
at
that
same
time
you
have
it
in
your
power
to
withhold
the
means
of
my
existence
free
will
you
look
down
here
at
these
whose
sight
is
shadowed
with
the
ebon
shadow
of
despair
these
the
homeless
the
disinherited
the
product
of
whose
toil
you
take
and
leave
them
barely
enough
to
live
upon
live
to
toil
on
and
keep
you
in
your
luxury
you
the
monied
idlers
you
the
and
the
journalists
who
do
more
to
cry
down
truth
to
laud
our
social
lies
our
economic
despots
and
our
pious
frauds
than
any
other
propaganda
can
you
the
doctors
whose
drugs
have
cursed
the
world
with
bodies
corroded
the
health
of
unborn
generations
with
your
medicated
slime
and
when
the
sources
of
life
have
yielded
to
the
hungry
body
so
poor
a
stream
that
for
lack
of
air
and
earth
and
sun
and
food
and
clothing
and
recreation
it
drooped
and
sickened
have
bottled
up
some
nauseating
stuff
and
with
oracular
wisdom
have
taught
them
to
imagine
it
could
undo
what
years
of
misery
had
done
you
the
who
have
twisted
nature
code
till
to
be
natural
is
to
be
a
criminal
you
who
have
lawed
away
the
earth
that
was
not
yours
to
give
you
who
even
seek
to
charter
the
sea
and
make
the
commandment
across
the
middle
of
this
river
thou
shalt
not
go
unless
thou
render
tribute
unto
cæsar
you
who
never
inquire
what
is
but
what
is
law
and
you
the
teachers
you
who
prate
of
the
glory
of
knowledge
as
the
remedy
for
the
evils
of
the
world
and
boast
your
compulsory
law
of
education
while
a
stronger
law
than
all
the
wordy
sentences
ever
graven
upon
statute
books
is
driving
the
children
out
of
the
schoolground
into
the
factory
into
the
into
the
shaft
into
the
furrow
into
the
myriad
camps
of
toil
to
the
dust
of
the
wheel
to
the
heat
of
the
furnace
till
their
pallid
cheeks
and
bloodless
lips
are
bleached
like
bones
beneath
the
desert
sun
and
their
clogged
lungs
rattle
in
their
breathing
pain
will
you
look
at
these
the
of
your
social
earth
and
tell
them
they
are
free
will
you
tell
them
ignorance
is
their
greatest
curse
and
education
their
only
remedy
will
you
say
to
these
children
we
have
provided
free
schools
for
you
and
now
we
compel
you
to
attend
them
whether
you
have
anything
to
eat
and
wear
or
not
will
you
tell
these
people
there
is
a
good
kind
merciful
god
who
loves
them
meting
out
justice
to
them
from
the
skies
no
you
not
you
the
words
will
die
upon
your
lips
ere
you
utter
them
do
you
know
what
it
is
they
see
up
there
above
you
they
whose
eyes
look
through
the
mist
of
gray
and
the
shroud
of
darkness
they
see
your
god
of
justice
a
pitiless
his
church
more
brutal
than
the
lash
his
state
more
merciless
than
the
bloodhound
they
see
themselves
a
thousand
million
serfs
more
hopelessly
enthralled
more
helplessly
chained
down
than
the
lashed
and
tortured
body
of
the
chattel
slave
for
them
there
is
no
refuge
no
escape
in
every
land
the
master
rules
no
fugitive
slave
law
need
now
be
passed
there
is
no
place
to
flee
the
whole
horizon
is
white
and
black
alike
are
yoked
together
and
the
master
yields
no
distinction
shows
no
mercy
the
bare
pittance
of
existence
is
the
meed
for
him
who
toils
and
for
him
who
starvation
with
a
preacher
to
help
him
die
that
is
the
justice
that
they
see
there
in
the
shadow
lines
above
your
golden
haze
and
they
see
too
a
conflict
preparing
between
those
two
antagonistic
forces
such
as
never
before
the
world
has
witnessed
they
see
your
god
concentrating
his
strength
to
fight
so
bitter
a
battle
with
liberty
as
shall
crush
the
spirit
of
individuality
forever
from
the
race
they
see
him
ranging
his
forces
those
forces
through
all
the
anguished
past
the
blacklist
the
club
the
sword
the
rifle
the
prison
aye
the
scaffold
they
see
them
all
and
know
that
ere
your
god
will
yield
his
vested
rights
the
noblest
of
the
race
will
have
been
stricken
the
most
unselfish
will
have
been
tortured
in
his
dungeons
the
white
robes
of
innocence
will
have
been
reddened
in
her
own
blood
and
death
will
have
shadowed
many
and
many
a
home
unless
you
shall
hearken
to
the
voice
of
liberty
and
save
yourselves
while
there
is
yet
time
they
see
the
wide
stage
spreading
out
they
see
the
passions
moving
over
it
they
see
there
in
the
center
beneath
the
rolling
brilliance
of
the
empire
state
the
tragic
inauguration
of
the
act
they
see
a
grim
and
blackened
thing
a
silent
thing
the
demoniac
effigy
of
torquemada
spirit
the
frozen
laugh
of
the
dark
ages
at
our
boasted
civilization
they
see
twelve
stolid
fools
before
this
nineteenth
century
gallows
they
see
the
hiding
place
of
that
thing
masquerading
under
the
sacred
name
of
justice
which
shrinks
even
from
the
gaze
of
the
lauding
press
and
the
imbecile
jurymen
and
does
unknown
its
deed
of
murder
they
see
four
shrouded
forms
they
hear
four
muffled
voices
a
broken
sentence
and
an
awful
hush
and
then
o
crowning
irony
of
all
they
see
advancing
to
speak
to
them
over
the
bodies
of
the
murdered
and
mouthed
back
from
a
hundred
pulpits
comes
the
echo
jehovah
masked
as
jesus
ah
the
divine
cowardice
of
it
mild
is
the
light
in
the
nazarene
eyes
tender
the
tone
of
the
nazarene
voice
ah
people
whom
i
love
for
whom
my
life
was
given
long
ago
on
calvary
what
rashness
is
it
that
you
meditate
is
it
that
you
are
weary
of
the
yoke
of
love
i
lay
on
you
is
this
your
faith
have
i
not
promised
you
a
sweet
release
when
your
dark
pilgrimage
on
earth
is
exiles
ye
are
upon
this
world
of
pain
and
if
oppression
comes
to
weigh
you
down
if
hunger
shows
his
long
fangs
at
your
hearth
if
your
chilled
limbs
are
cramped
with
bitter
cold
the
while
your
neighbor
hoards
his
fuel
up
if
you
are
driven
out
upon
the
street
with
crying
children
clinging
piteously
and
begging
you
for
shelter
from
the
storm
if
your
hard
toil
is
taken
by
the
law
to
satisfy
a
corporation
greed
if
fever
and
distress
gnaw
at
your
heart
and
still
you
tread
the
weary
out
knowing
no
rest
until
the
comes
if
all
these
things
discourage
and
perplex
know
is
for
love
of
you
i
order
it
for
thus
would
i
point
you
to
paradise
win
you
from
all
the
pleasure
of
the
world
and
fix
your
hopes
on
heaven
eternity
the
lord
loveth
him
he
chasteneth
so
then
it
is
for
love
that
these
things
are
for
love
of
you
i
press
your
out
for
love
of
you
i
load
you
down
with
pain
for
love
of
you
i
take
your
rights
away
for
love
of
you
i
institute
the
law
that
slaves
you
to
the
grasping
millionaire
for
love
of
you
i
pile
the
glutted
hoards
of
vanderbilt
and
gould
and
rothschild
and
the
rest
for
love
of
you
i
rent
the
right
to
breathe
in
a
poor
tenement
of
dingy
dirt
for
love
of
you
i
make
machines
a
curse
for
love
of
you
i
make
you
toil
long
hours
and
those
who
can
not
toil
i
turn
adrift
to
wander
as
they
may
sons
into
dens
where
thievery
is
learned
as
a
fine
art
daughters
to
barter
their
virginity
till
competition
forces
down
the
price
of
lust
and
death
is
left
them
as
a
last
resort
ah
what
a
golden
crown
and
harp
what
a
resplendent
whit
robe
await
the
soul
whom
so
god
loves
while
on
the
earth
it
dwells
aye
for
the
love
of
you
these
men
were
murdered
and
for
my
glory
and
through
my
holy
love
they
roast
in
hell
for
they
would
take
away
the
instruments
whereby
i
lure
you
to
my
blest
abode
they
would
have
taught
you
what
your
freedom
meant
they
would
have
told
you
to
regain
your
rights
they
would
have
contradicted
my
commands
and
lost
you
heaven
perchance
and
if
not
heaven
keep
to
your
faith
my
people
trust
in
god
break
not
the
altars
where
your
fathers
knelt
trust
to
your
teachers
keep
within
the
law
bow
to
the
church
and
kiss
the
state
great
toe
so
shall
good
order
be
observed
obeyed
and
as
reigned
in
warsaw
so
anon
shall
to
men
reign
on
the
earth
these
are
the
words
that
fall
from
the
lips
of
him
you
call
the
merciful
the
just
these
are
the
sounds
that
sink
into
the
ears
of
those
upon
whose
toil
are
dependent
for
your
existence
judge
you
how
they
will
be
received
and
now
you
the
dwellers
on
the
lifted
heights
listen
to
the
voice
that
follows
him
for
these
are
words
that
concern
and
if
you
listen
to
their
warning
you
may
yet
save
yourselves
the
desolation
and
the
ruin
that
otherwise
must
come
this
deep
voice
that
echoes
through
the
corridors
of
thought
till
almost
death
chill
sleepers
might
arise
again
is
the
voice
which
called
for
centuries
to
the
empire
cease
your
oppressions
or
the
people
rise
and
to
the
kingdom
curse
not
the
new
world
with
your
tyrannies
it
will
rebel
and
to
the
master
put
not
the
lash
upon
your
bonded
slave
for
the
time
will
come
when
every
stroke
will
rise
like
a
warrior
armed
to
burn
and
waste
and
kill
the
empire
laughed
the
kingdom
ignored
the
planter
sneered
but
the
time
came
when
laugh
and
sneer
died
to
white
ashes
the
time
came
when
france
got
drunk
with
blood
to
vomit
crime
when
england
lost
the
brightest
jewel
in
her
coronal
when
the
south
waded
in
blood
and
tears
and
knelt
her
pride
before
a
conqueror
and
now
she
the
liberator
the
destined
conqueror
of
god
calls
out
to
you
yield
up
your
scepters
ere
they
be
torn
from
you
give
back
the
stolen
earth
the
mine
the
sea
give
back
the
source
of
life
give
back
the
light
for
a
black
bitter
hour
is
waiting
you
an
awful
gulf
unfathomed
in
its
depth
if
now
you
do
not
pause
and
render
ah
thou
whatever
be
thy
awful
name
which
like
a
serpent
trail
hath
marked
the
earth
whether
jehovah
buddha
joss
or
christ
thou
who
hast
done
for
what
others
do
for
most
envenomed
how
hast
thou
hated
these
the
happy
ones
is
this
impartial
justice
then
to
these
to
pour
the
golden
treasures
of
the
earth
into
their
laps
that
these
may
feast
and
toast
and
so
forget
thee
and
thy
promised
heaven
truly
thou
hast
been
most
unkind
to
them
since
kindness
means
with
thee
a
tearing
out
of
the
heart
and
entrails
of
existence
bah
how
thou
liest
to
what
most
pitiable
trick
of
speech
hast
thou
been
forced
thou
the
dwellers
in
the
darkness
longer
take
thy
creed
of
crystalline
deception
no
they
laugh
at
thee
they
spew
thee
out
they
spit
at
thee
love
say
look
this
long
procession
coming
here
here
are
the
murderers
with
their
eyes
here
the
adulterers
with
their
lecherous
glance
here
are
the
prostitutes
with
their
mark
of
shame
here
are
the
gamblers
with
their
itching
hands
here
are
the
thieves
with
furtive
lips
and
eyes
here
are
the
liars
with
their
dastard
tongues
here
all
the
train
that
crime
can
muster
up
reviews
before
thee
and
after
them
a
ghastly
fearful
sight
follow
the
victims
of
their
blackened
hearts
slain
ruined
desolated
by
thy
love
and
now
behold
another
train
comes
on
a
train
whose
name
is
legion
here
the
dark
bruted
faces
from
the
mines
here
the
hard
cheeks
from
out
the
furrow
here
the
dull
visage
from
the
here
the
wan
eyes
from
whirling
factory
here
the
gaunt
giants
from
the
furnace
fire
here
the
tarred
hands
from
off
the
stream
and
sea
here
all
the
aching
limbs
that
stand
behind
the
fashionable
counter
here
o
pitiful
sight
of
all
those
whose
home
is
in
the
street
whose
table
is
the
garbage
pile
the
vast
helpless
body
of
the
unemployed
and
ever
as
they
march
they
drop
and
drop
into
the
earth
that
swallows
them
and
over
their
graves
the
march
goes
on
these
are
thy
victims
god
these
are
the
creatures
of
thy
church
and
law
speak
no
more
of
the
breaking
of
altars
thou
who
hast
broken
every
altar
that
the
human
heart
holds
dear
take
thy
position
at
the
head
of
the
column
and
when
thou
hast
marched
away
into
the
past
thou
and
thy
preachers
and
thy
praters
of
justice
then
will
the
world
to
justice
and
the
great
law
of
nature
reign
upon
the
earth
then
will
her
broad
green
acres
yield
their
wealth
to
him
who
toils
and
him
alone
then
will
the
of
nature
yield
her
fuel
and
her
light
not
to
the
corporation
whose
lobbying
can
buy
it
for
in
that
time
no
wealth
nor
intrigue
can
purchase
the
heritage
of
all
but
to
all
the
sons
and
daughters
of
labor
and
then
upon
earth
there
shall
be
no
hungry
mouths
no
freezing
limbs
no
children
spending
the
hours
of
youth
in
gaining
a
miserable
livelihood
no
women
crying
it
oh
to
be
a
slave
along
with
the
barbarous
turk
where
woman
has
never
a
soul
to
save
if
this
is
work
no
men
wandering
aimlessly
in
search
of
a
master
for
their
slavery
but
o
careless
dwellers
upon
the
heights
awaken
now
do
not
wait
till
reason
persuasion
judgment
coolness
are
swept
down
before
the
rising
whirlwind
bend
your
energies
to
the
eradication
of
the
authority
idea
to
righting
the
wrongs
of
your
do
it
for
your
own
interest
for
if
you
slumber
on
ah
me
ye
will
awaken
one
day
when
an
ominous
rumble
prefaces
the
waking
of
a
terrific
underground
thunder
when
the
earth
shakes
in
a
frightful
ague
fit
when
from
out
the
parched
throats
of
the
people
a
burning
cry
will
come
like
lava
from
a
crater
bread
bread
no
more
preachers
no
more
politicians
no
more
lawyers
no
more
gods
no
more
heavens
no
more
promises
bread
and
then
when
you
hear
a
terrible
leaden
groan
know
that
at
last
here
in
your
free
america
beneath
the
floating
banner
of
the
stars
and
stripes
more
than
fifty
million
human
hearts
have
burst
a
dynamite
bomb
that
will
shock
the
continent
to
its
foundations
and
knock
the
sea
back
from
its
shores
it
is
no
boast
it
is
no
threat
thus
history
iron
law
decrees
the
day
grows
hot
o
babylon
is
cool
beneath
thy
willow
trees
sketches
and
stories
a
rocket
of
iron
it
was
one
of
those
misty
october
nightfalls
of
the
north
when
the
white
fog
creeps
up
from
the
river
and
winds
itself
like
a
around
the
black
mass
of
human
insignificance
a
cold
menace
from
nature
to
man
till
the
foreboding
of
that
irresistible
fatality
which
will
one
day
lay
us
all
beneath
the
sits
upon
your
breast
and
stifles
you
till
you
start
up
desperately
crying
let
me
out
let
me
out
for
an
hour
i
had
been
staring
through
the
window
at
that
chill
steam
thickening
and
blurring
out
the
lines
that
through
it
indefinitely
pale
drunken
images
of
facts
staggering
against
the
invulnerable
vapor
that
walled
me
in
a
sublimated
grave
marble
were
they
all
ghosts
those
figures
wandering
across
the
white
night
hardly
distinguishable
from
the
posts
and
pickets
that
wove
in
and
out
like
bodies
writhing
in
pain
my
own
fingers
were
curiously
numb
and
inert
had
i
too
become
a
shadow
it
grew
unbearable
at
last
the
pressure
of
the
foreboding
at
my
heart
the
sense
of
that
of
universal
death
i
ran
out
of
doors
impelled
by
the
vague
impulse
to
assert
my
own
being
to
seek
relief
in
struggle
even
though
foredoomed
futile
to
seek
warmth
fellowship
somewhere
though
but
with
those
ineffective
pallors
in
the
mist
that
dissolved
even
while
i
looked
at
them
once
in
the
street
i
ran
on
indifferently
glad
to
be
jostled
glad
of
the
snarling
of
dogs
and
the
curses
of
laborers
calling
to
one
another
the
penumbra
of
the
mist
that
menacing
dim
foreshadow
had
not
chilled
these
then
on
on
through
the
alleys
where
human
flesh
was
close
and
when
one
listened
one
could
hear
breathings
and
many
feet
drifting
at
last
into
the
current
that
swept
through
the
main
channel
of
the
city
and
presently
whirled
round
in
an
eddy
i
found
myself
staring
through
the
open
door
of
the
great
iron
works
perhaps
it
was
the
sensation
of
warmth
that
held
me
there
first
some
feeling
of
exhilaration
and
wakening
defiance
in
the
flash
and
swirl
of
the
yellow
flames
this
mixed
with
an
indistinct
desire
to
clutch
at
something
anything
that
seemed
stationary
in
the
midst
of
all
this
that
slipped
and
wavered
and
fell
away
no
i
remember
now
there
was
something
before
that
there
was
a
sound
a
sound
that
had
stopped
my
feet
in
their
going
and
smote
me
with
a
long
shudder
a
sound
of
hammers
beating
beating
beating
a
terrific
hail
momentarily
faster
and
louder
and
in
between
a
panting
as
of
some
great
monster
catching
breath
beneath
the
driving
of
that
iron
rain
faster
faster
clang
a
long
reverberant
shriek
the
giant
had
rolled
and
shivered
in
his
pain
involuntarily
i
was
drawn
down
into
the
valley
of
the
sound
words
muttering
themselves
through
my
lips
as
i
passed
forging
forging
what
are
they
forging
there
frankenstein
makes
his
monster
how
the
iron
screams
but
i
heard
it
no
more
now
i
only
saw
saw
the
curling
yellow
flames
and
the
red
red
iron
that
panted
and
the
masters
of
the
hammers
how
they
moved
there
like
demons
in
the
abyss
their
bodies
swinging
their
eyes
tense
and
their
faces
covered
with
the
gloom
of
the
only
face
i
saw
young
and
fair
young
and
very
fair
whereon
the
gloom
seemed
not
to
settle
the
skin
of
it
was
white
and
shining
there
in
the
midst
of
that
black
haze
over
the
wide
forehead
fell
tumbling
waves
of
thick
brown
hair
and
two
great
dark
eyes
looked
steadily
into
the
red
iron
as
if
they
saw
therein
something
i
did
not
see
only
now
and
then
they
were
lifted
and
looked
away
upward
as
if
beyond
the
they
beheld
a
vision
once
he
turned
so
that
the
cast
forth
his
profile
as
a
silhouette
and
i
shivered
it
was
so
fine
and
hard
hard
with
the
hardness
of
beaten
iron
and
fine
with
the
fineness
of
a
keen
chisel
had
the
hammers
been
beating
on
that
fair
young
face
a
comrade
called
a
sudden
terrified
cry
there
was
a
wild
rush
a
mad
stampede
of
feet
a
horrible
screech
of
hissing
metal
and
a
rocket
of
iron
shot
upward
toward
the
black
roof
bursting
and
falling
in
a
burning
shower
three
figures
lay
writhing
along
the
floor
among
the
leaping
demoniac
sparks
the
first
to
lift
them
was
the
man
with
the
white
face
he
had
stood
still
in
the
storm
and
ran
forward
when
the
others
shrank
back
now
he
passed
by
me
bearing
his
dying
burden
and
i
saw
no
quiver
upon
brow
or
chin
only
when
he
laid
it
in
the
ambulance
i
fancied
i
saw
upon
the
delicate
curved
lips
a
line
of
purpose
deepen
and
the
reflection
of
the
glow
in
the
strange
eyes
as
if
for
an
instant
the
door
of
a
hidden
furnace
had
been
opened
and
smouldering
coals
had
breathed
the
air
and
even
then
he
looked
up
it
was
all
over
in
half
an
hour
there
would
be
weeping
in
three
little
homes
and
one
was
dead
and
one
would
die
and
one
would
crawl
a
seared
human
stump
to
the
end
of
his
weary
days
the
crowd
that
had
gathered
was
gone
they
would
not
know
the
stump
when
it
begged
from
them
with
its
maimed
hands
six
months
after
on
some
street
corner
fakir
they
would
say
and
laugh
there
would
be
an
entry
on
the
company
books
and
a
brief
line
in
the
newspapers
next
day
but
the
welding
of
the
iron
would
go
on
and
the
man
who
gave
his
easy
money
for
it
would
fancy
he
had
paid
for
it
not
seeing
the
stiff
figures
in
their
graves
nor
the
crippled
beggar
nor
the
broken
homes
the
rocket
of
iron
is
already
cold
dull
inert
fireless
the
black
fragments
lie
upon
the
floor
whereon
they
lately
rained
their
red
revenge
do
with
them
what
you
will
you
can
not
undo
their
work
the
men
are
clearing
way
only
he
with
the
white
face
does
not
go
back
to
his
place
still
set
and
silent
he
takes
his
coat
presses
his
soft
hat
down
upon
his
thick
damp
locks
and
goes
out
into
the
fog
and
night
so
close
he
passed
me
i
might
have
touched
him
but
he
never
saw
me
perhaps
he
was
still
carrying
the
burden
of
the
dying
man
upon
his
heart
perhaps
some
mightier
burden
for
one
instant
the
shapely
boyish
figure
was
in
full
light
then
it
vanished
away
in
the
engulfing
mist
the
mist
which
the
vision
of
him
had
made
me
forget
for
i
knew
i
had
seen
a
man
of
iron
into
whose
soul
the
iron
had
driven
whose
nerves
were
tempered
as
cold
steel
but
behind
whose
still
impassive
features
slumbered
a
heart
and
others
should
see
a
rocket
and
a
ruin
and
feel
the
vengeance
of
beaten
iron
before
the
mist
comes
and
swallows
all
i
had
forgotten
upon
that
face
that
young
fair
face
so
smooth
and
fine
that
even
the
black
smoke
would
not
rest
upon
it
there
bloomed
the
roses
of
early
death
flowers
the
chain
gang
it
is
far
far
down
in
the
southland
and
i
am
back
again
thanks
be
in
the
land
of
wind
and
snow
where
life
lives
but
that
was
in
the
days
when
i
was
a
wretched
thing
that
crept
and
crawled
and
shrunk
when
the
wind
blew
and
feared
the
snow
so
they
sent
me
away
down
there
to
the
world
of
the
sun
where
the
wind
and
the
snow
are
afraid
and
the
sun
was
kind
to
me
and
the
soft
air
that
does
not
move
lay
around
me
like
folds
of
down
and
the
poor
creeping
life
in
me
winked
in
the
light
and
stared
out
at
the
wide
caressing
air
stared
away
to
the
north
to
the
land
of
wind
and
rain
where
my
heart
was
my
heart
that
would
be
at
home
yes
there
in
the
tender
south
my
heart
was
bitter
and
bowed
for
the
love
of
the
singing
wind
and
the
frost
whose
edge
was
death
bitter
and
bowed
for
the
strength
to
bear
that
was
gone
and
the
strength
to
love
that
abode
day
after
day
i
climbed
the
hills
with
my
face
to
the
north
and
home
and
there
on
those
southern
heights
where
the
air
was
resin
and
balm
there
smote
on
my
ears
the
sound
that
all
the
wind
of
the
north
can
never
sing
down
again
the
sound
i
shall
hear
till
i
stand
at
the
door
of
the
last
silence
cling
clang
cling
from
the
georgian
hills
it
sounds
and
the
snow
and
the
storm
can
not
drown
it
the
terrible
music
of
the
chain
gang
i
met
it
there
on
the
road
face
to
face
with
all
the
light
of
the
sun
upon
it
do
you
know
what
it
is
do
you
know
that
every
day
men
run
in
long
procession
upon
the
road
they
build
for
others
safe
and
easy
going
bound
to
a
chain
and
that
other
men
with
guns
upon
their
shoulders
ride
beside
them
with
orders
to
kill
if
the
living
links
break
there
it
stretched
before
me
a
serpent
of
human
bodies
bound
to
the
iron
and
wrapped
in
the
merciless
folds
of
justified
cruelty
clank
clink
clank
there
was
an
order
given
the
living
chain
divided
groups
fell
to
work
upon
the
road
and
then
i
saw
and
heard
a
miracle
have
you
ever
out
of
a
drowsy
lazy
conviction
that
all
knowledges
all
arts
all
dreams
are
only
patient
sums
of
many
toils
of
many
millions
dead
and
living
suddenly
started
into
an
uncanny
consciousness
that
knowledges
and
arts
and
dreams
are
things
more
real
than
any
living
being
ever
was
which
suddenly
reveal
themselves
unasked
and
unawaited
in
the
most
obscure
corners
of
flashing
out
in
prismatic
glory
to
dazzle
and
shock
all
your
security
of
thought
toppling
it
with
vague
questions
of
what
is
reality
that
you
can
not
silence
when
you
hear
that
an
untaught
child
is
able
he
knows
not
how
to
do
the
works
of
the
magicians
of
mathematics
has
it
never
seemed
to
you
that
suddenly
all
books
were
swept
away
and
there
before
you
stood
a
superb
creation
mathematics
itself
posing
problems
to
men
whose
eyes
are
cast
down
and
all
at
once
out
of
whim
incorporating
itself
in
that
mysterious
child
have
you
ever
felt
that
all
the
works
of
the
masters
were
swept
aside
in
the
burst
of
a
singing
voice
unconscious
that
it
sings
and
that
music
itself
a
has
entered
the
throat
and
sung
no
you
have
never
felt
it
but
you
have
never
heard
the
chain
gang
sing
their
faces
were
black
and
brutal
and
hopeless
their
brows
were
low
their
jaws
were
heavy
their
eyes
were
hard
three
hundred
years
of
the
scorn
that
brands
had
burned
its
scar
upon
the
face
and
form
of
ignorance
ignorance
that
had
sought
dully
stupidly
blindly
and
been
answered
with
that
pitiless
brand
but
wide
beyond
the
limits
of
high
man
and
his
little
scorn
the
great
sweet
old
the
chords
of
the
world
smote
through
the
black
man
fibre
in
the
days
of
the
making
of
men
and
it
sings
it
sings
with
its
strings
through
all
the
voices
of
the
chain
gang
and
never
one
so
low
that
it
does
not
fill
with
the
humming
vibrancy
that
quivers
and
bursts
out
singing
things
always
new
and
new
and
new
i
heard
it
that
day
the
leader
struck
his
pick
into
the
earth
and
for
a
moment
whistled
like
some
wild
free
living
flute
in
the
forest
then
his
voice
floated
out
like
a
low
booming
wind
crying
an
instant
and
fell
there
was
the
measure
of
a
grave
in
the
fall
of
it
another
voice
rose
up
and
lifted
the
dead
note
aloft
like
a
mourner
raising
his
beloved
with
a
kiss
it
drifted
away
to
the
hills
and
the
sun
then
many
voices
rolled
forward
like
a
great
plunging
wave
in
a
chorus
never
heard
before
perhaps
never
again
for
each
man
sung
his
own
song
as
it
came
yet
all
blent
the
words
were
few
simple
filled
with
a
great
plaint
the
wail
of
the
sea
was
in
it
and
no
man
knew
what
his
brother
would
sing
yet
added
his
own
without
thought
as
the
rhythm
swept
on
and
no
voice
knew
what
note
its
fellow
voice
would
sing
yet
they
fell
in
one
another
as
the
billow
falls
in
the
trough
or
rolls
to
the
crest
one
upon
the
other
one
within
the
other
over
under
all
in
the
great
wave
and
now
one
led
and
others
followed
then
it
dropped
back
and
another
swelled
upward
and
every
voice
was
soloist
and
chorister
and
never
one
seemed
conscious
of
itself
but
only
to
sing
out
the
great
song
and
always
as
the
voices
rose
and
sank
the
axes
swung
and
fell
and
the
lean
white
face
of
the
man
with
the
gun
looked
on
with
a
stolid
paralyzed
smile
oh
that
wild
sombre
melody
that
long
appealing
plaint
with
its
hope
laid
beyond
death
that
melody
that
was
made
only
there
just
now
before
me
and
passing
away
before
me
if
i
could
only
seize
it
hold
it
stop
it
from
passing
that
all
the
world
might
hear
the
song
of
the
chain
gang
might
know
that
here
in
these
red
georgian
hills
convicts
black
brutal
convicts
are
making
the
music
that
is
of
no
compelling
that
floods
like
the
tide
and
ebbs
away
like
the
tide
and
will
not
be
held
and
is
gone
far
away
and
forever
out
into
the
abyss
where
the
voices
of
the
centuries
have
drifted
and
are
lost
something
about
jesus
and
a
lamp
in
the
darkness
a
gulfing
darkness
oh
in
the
mass
of
sunshine
must
they
still
cry
for
light
all
around
the
sweep
and
the
glory
of
shimmering
ether
sun
sun
a
world
of
sun
and
these
still
calling
for
light
sun
for
the
road
sun
for
the
stones
sun
for
the
red
clay
and
no
light
for
this
dark
living
clay
only
heat
that
burns
and
blaze
that
blinds
but
does
not
lift
the
darkness
and
lead
me
to
that
lamp
the
pathetic
prayer
for
light
went
trembling
away
out
into
the
luminous
gulf
of
day
and
the
axes
swung
and
fell
and
the
grim
dry
face
of
the
man
with
the
gun
looked
on
with
its
frozen
smile
so
long
as
they
sing
they
work
said
the
smile
still
and
ironical
a
friend
to
them
that
got
no
friend
man
of
sorrows
lifted
up
upon
golgotha
in
the
day
when
the
forces
of
the
law
and
the
might
of
social
order
set
you
there
in
the
moment
of
your
pain
and
desperate
accusation
against
heaven
when
that
piercing
eloi
eloi
lama
sabachthani
went
up
to
a
deaf
sky
did
you
presage
this
desolate
appeal
coming
to
you
out
of
the
unlived
depths
of
nineteen
hundred
years
hopeless
hope
that
cries
to
the
dead
futile
pleading
that
the
cup
may
pass
while
still
the
lips
drink
for
as
of
old
order
and
the
law
in
shining
helmets
and
gleaming
spears
ringed
round
the
felon
of
golgotha
so
stand
they
still
in
that
lean
merciless
figure
with
its
shouldered
gun
and
passive
smile
and
the
moan
that
died
within
the
place
of
skulls
is
born
again
in
this
great
dark
cry
rising
up
against
the
sun
if
but
the
living
might
hear
it
not
the
dead
for
these
are
dead
who
walk
about
with
vengeance
and
despite
within
their
hearts
and
scorn
for
things
dark
and
lowly
in
the
odor
of
with
wisdom
in
their
souls
and
pride
of
race
and
order
and
the
preservation
of
things
that
are
walking
stones
are
these
that
can
not
hear
but
the
living
are
those
who
seek
to
know
who
wot
not
of
things
lowly
or
things
high
but
only
of
things
wonderful
and
who
turn
sorrowfully
from
things
that
are
hoping
for
things
that
may
be
if
these
should
hear
the
chain
gang
chorus
seize
it
make
all
the
living
hear
it
see
it
if
from
among
themselves
one
man
might
find
the
lamp
lift
it
up
paint
for
all
the
world
these
georgian
hills
these
red
sunburned
roads
these
toiling
figures
with
their
rhythmic
axes
these
brutal
unillumined
faces
dull
groping
and
then
unloose
that
song
upon
their
ears
till
they
feel
the
smitten
quivering
hearts
of
the
sons
of
music
beating
against
their
own
and
under
and
over
and
around
it
the
chain
that
the
dead
have
forged
clinking
between
the
clang
cling
clang
ng
it
is
sundown
they
are
running
over
the
red
road
now
the
voices
are
silent
only
the
chain
clinks
the
heart
of
angiolillo
some
women
are
born
to
love
stories
as
the
sparks
fly
upward
you
see
it
every
time
they
glance
at
you
and
you
feel
it
every
time
they
lay
a
finger
on
your
sleeve
there
was
a
party
the
other
night
and
a
old
baby
who
could
sleep
for
the
noise
crept
down
into
the
parlor
half
frightened
to
death
and
transfixed
with
wonderment
at
the
crude
performances
of
an
obtuse
visitor
who
was
shouting
out
the
woes
of
othello
one
kindly
little
woman
took
the
baby
in
her
arms
and
said
what
would
they
do
to
you
if
you
made
all
that
noise
whip
me
whispered
the
child
her
round
black
eyes
half
admiration
and
half
terror
and
altogether
coquettish
as
she
hid
and
peered
round
the
woman
neck
and
every
man
in
the
room
forthwith
fell
in
love
with
her
and
wanted
to
smother
his
face
in
the
bewitching
rings
of
dark
hair
that
crowned
the
dainty
head
and
carry
her
about
on
his
shoulders
or
get
down
on
his
hands
and
knees
to
play
horse
for
her
or
let
her
walk
on
his
neck
or
obliterate
his
dignity
in
any
other
way
she
might
prefer
the
boys
tolerated
their
fathers
with
a
superior
huh
fourteen
or
fifteen
years
from
now
they
will
be
playing
the
humble
cousin
of
the
horse
before
the
same
little
lady
and
having
sported
nick
bottom
ears
to
no
purpose
half
a
dozen
or
so
will
go
off
and
hang
themselves
or
turn
monk
or
become
bold
bad
men
and
revenge
themselves
on
the
sex
but
her
conquests
will
go
on
and
when
those
gracious
rings
are
white
as
snow
the
children
of
those
boys
will
follow
in
their
grandfathers
and
fathers
steps
and
dangle
after
her
and
make
drawings
on
their
fly
leaves
of
that
sweet
of
a
mouth
of
hers
and
call
her
their
elder
sister
and
other
devotional
names
and
the
other
girls
of
her
generation
who
were
not
born
with
that
marvelous
entangling
grace
in
every
line
and
look
will
dread
her
and
spite
her
and
feel
mean
satisfaction
when
some
poor
fool
does
swallow
laudanum
on
her
account
smiles
of
glacial
virtue
will
creep
over
their
faces
like
slippery
sunshine
when
one
by
one
her
devotees
come
trailing
off
to
them
to
say
that
such
a
woman
could
never
fill
a
man
heart
nor
become
the
ornament
of
his
hearthstone
the
quiet
virtues
that
wear
are
all
their
desire
of
course
they
have
just
been
studying
her
character
and
that
of
the
foolish
men
who
dance
her
attendance
but
even
those
are
not
doing
it
with
any
serious
motives
and
the
neglected
girls
will
serve
him
with
cake
and
wine
which
he
will
presently
convert
into
agony
in
that
pearl
shell
ear
of
hers
and
all
the
while
the
baby
will
have
done
nothing
but
be
what
she
was
born
to
be
through
none
of
her
own
choosing
which
is
her
lot
and
portion
and
that
is
another
thing
the
gods
will
have
to
explain
when
the
day
comes
that
they
go
on
trial
before
men
which
is
the
real
day
of
judgment
but
this
is
the
baby
story
which
has
yet
to
be
made
but
the
story
of
one
who
somehow
received
a
wrong
portion
some
inadvertent
little
angel
in
the
destiny
shop
took
down
her
name
when
the
heroine
of
a
romance
was
called
for
and
put
her
where
she
should
have
been
and
then
ran
off
to
play
no
doubt
not
stopping
to
look
twice
for
even
the
most
insouciant
angel
that
looked
twice
would
have
seen
that
effie
was
no
woman
to
play
the
game
of
hearts
and
there
only
one
thing
more
undiscerning
than
an
angel
and
that
is
a
social
reformer
effie
ran
up
against
both
they
say
she
had
blood
in
her
girlhood
that
it
shone
red
and
steady
through
that
thin
pure
skin
of
hers
but
when
i
saw
her
with
her
nursing
baby
in
her
arms
down
in
the
smutching
grime
of
london
there
was
only
a
fluctuant
blush
a
sort
of
pink
ghost
of
blood
hovering
back
and
forth
on
her
face
and
that
was
for
shame
of
the
poverty
of
her
neat
bare
room
not
that
she
had
ever
known
riches
she
was
the
daughter
of
scotch
peasants
and
had
gone
out
to
service
when
she
was
still
a
child
her
chest
was
hollowed
in
and
her
back
bowed
with
that
unnatural
labor
there
was
no
gloss
on
the
pale
sandy
hair
no
wilding
tendrils
clinging
round
the
straight
smooth
forehead
no
light
of
coquetry
or
grace
in
the
glimmering
blue
eyes
no
beauty
in
her
at
all
unless
it
lay
in
the
fine
hard
sculptured
line
of
her
nose
and
mouth
and
chin
when
she
turned
her
head
sideways
you
could
read
in
that
line
that
having
spoken
a
word
to
her
heart
she
would
not
forget
it
nor
unsay
it
and
if
it
took
her
down
into
gethsemane
she
would
never
cry
out
though
by
all
forsaken
and
that
was
where
it
had
taken
her
then
some
ready
condemner
of
all
that
has
been
tried
for
less
than
a
thousand
years
will
say
it
was
because
she
had
the
just
reward
of
those
who
holding
that
love
is
its
own
sanction
and
that
it
can
not
be
anything
but
degraded
by
seeking
permissions
from
social
authorities
live
their
love
lives
without
the
consent
of
church
and
state
but
you
and
i
know
that
the
same
dark
garden
has
awaited
the
woman
whose
love
has
been
blessed
by
both
and
that
many
such
a
life
lamp
has
flickered
out
in
a
night
as
profound
as
poverty
and
utter
loneliness
could
make
it
so
if
it
was
justice
to
effie
what
is
it
to
that
other
woman
in
truth
justice
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
she
loved
the
wrong
man
that
was
all
and
married
or
unmarried
it
would
have
been
the
same
for
a
formula
does
make
a
man
nor
the
lack
of
it
unmake
him
the
fellow
was
superior
in
intellect
it
is
honesty
only
which
can
wring
so
much
from
those
who
knew
them
both
for
as
to
any
other
thing
she
sat
as
high
over
him
as
the
stars
are
not
that
he
was
an
actively
bad
man
just
one
of
those
weak
uncertain
tumbling
about
characters
having
sense
enough
to
know
it
is
a
fine
thing
to
stand
alone
and
vanity
enough
to
want
the
name
without
the
game
and
cowardice
enough
to
creep
around
anything
stronger
than
itself
and
hang
there
and
spread
itself
about
and
say
lo
how
straight
am
i
and
if
the
stronger
thing
happens
to
be
a
father
or
a
brother
or
some
such
tolerant
piece
of
friendly
energy
he
amuses
himself
awhile
and
finally
gives
the
creeper
a
shake
and
says
here
now
go
hang
on
somebody
else
if
you
ca
stand
alone
and
the
world
says
he
should
have
done
it
before
but
if
it
happens
to
be
a
mother
or
a
sister
or
a
wife
or
a
sweetheart
she
encourages
him
to
think
he
is
a
wonderful
person
that
all
she
does
is
really
his
own
merit
and
she
is
proud
and
glad
to
serve
him
if
after
a
while
she
does
exactly
believe
it
any
more
she
says
and
does
the
same
and
the
world
says
she
is
a
fool
which
she
is
but
if
in
some
sudden
spurt
of
masculine
she
decides
to
fling
him
off
the
world
says
she
is
an
unwomanly
woman
which
again
she
is
so
much
the
better
effie
creeper
dabbled
in
literature
he
wanted
to
be
a
translator
and
several
other
things
his
appearance
was
mild
and
gentlemanly
even
he
always
spoke
respectfully
of
effie
and
as
if
momentously
impressed
with
a
sense
of
duty
towards
her
they
had
started
out
to
realize
the
free
life
together
and
the
glory
of
the
new
ideal
had
beckoned
them
forward
so
no
doubt
he
believed
for
a
pretender
always
deceives
himself
worse
than
anybody
else
but
still
at
that
particular
period
he
used
to
droop
his
head
wearily
and
admit
that
he
had
made
a
great
mistake
it
was
nobody
fault
but
his
own
but
of
course
effie
and
he
were
hardly
fitted
for
each
other
she
could
not
well
enter
into
his
hopes
and
ambitions
never
having
had
the
opportunity
to
develop
when
she
was
younger
he
had
hoped
to
stimulate
her
in
that
direction
but
he
feared
it
was
too
late
so
he
said
in
a
delicate
and
gentlemanly
way
as
he
went
from
one
house
to
the
other
and
was
invited
to
dinner
and
supper
and
made
himself
believe
he
was
looking
for
work
effie
meanwhile
was
taking
home
boys
caps
to
make
and
worrying
along
incredibly
on
bread
and
tea
and
walking
the
streets
with
the
baby
in
her
arms
when
she
had
no
caps
to
make
of
course
when
a
man
drinks
other
people
teas
a
great
many
times
and
sits
in
their
houses
and
borrows
odd
shillings
now
and
then
and
assumes
the
gentleman
he
is
ultimately
brought
to
the
necessity
of
asking
some
one
to
tea
with
him
so
one
spring
night
the
creeper
approached
effie
rather
dubiously
with
the
statement
that
he
had
asked
two
or
three
acquaintances
to
come
in
the
next
evening
and
he
supposed
she
would
need
to
prepare
tea
the
girl
was
just
fainting
from
starvation
then
and
she
asked
him
wearily
where
he
thought
she
was
to
get
it
he
cast
about
a
while
in
his
pusillanimous
way
for
things
that
might
do
and
finally
proposed
that
she
pawn
the
dress
the
white
dress
she
had
made
from
one
of
her
own
girlhood
dresses
and
the
only
thing
it
had
to
wear
when
she
took
it
out
for
air
that
was
the
limit
even
for
effie
she
said
she
would
take
anything
of
her
own
if
she
had
it
but
not
the
baby
and
she
turned
her
face
to
the
wall
and
clung
to
the
child
when
the
came
next
day
she
went
out
with
the
baby
and
walked
up
and
down
the
surging
london
streets
looking
in
the
windows
and
crushing
back
tears
what
the
creeper
did
with
his
guests
she
never
knew
for
she
did
not
return
till
long
after
dusk
when
she
was
too
weary
to
wander
any
more
and
she
found
no
one
there
but
himself
and
a
dark
stranger
who
spoke
little
and
with
an
italian
accent
but
who
measured
her
with
serious
intense
eyes
he
listened
to
the
creeper
but
he
looked
at
her
she
was
quite
fagged
out
and
more
bloodless
than
ever
as
she
sat
motionless
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
when
he
went
away
he
lifted
his
hat
to
her
with
the
grace
of
an
old
time
courtier
and
begged
her
pardon
if
he
had
intruded
some
days
after
that
he
came
in
again
and
brought
a
toy
for
the
baby
and
asked
her
if
he
might
carry
the
child
out
a
little
for
her
it
looked
sickly
shut
up
there
but
he
knew
it
must
be
heavy
for
her
to
carry
the
creeper
suddenly
discovered
that
he
could
carry
the
baby
all
this
happened
in
the
days
when
a
pious
queen
sat
on
the
throne
of
spain
with
eyes
turned
upward
in
much
holiness
she
failed
to
see
the
things
done
in
her
prisons
or
hear
the
groans
that
rose
up
from
the
zero
chamber
in
the
fortress
of
montjuich
though
all
europe
heard
and
even
in
america
the
echo
rang
while
she
told
her
beads
her
minister
gave
the
order
to
torture
the
anarchists
and
scarred
with
irons
maimed
and
deformed
and
maddened
with
the
nameless
horrors
that
the
good
devise
to
correct
the
bad
even
unto
this
day
the
evidences
of
that
infamous
order
live
but
two
men
do
not
live
the
one
who
gave
the
order
and
the
one
who
revenged
it
it
happened
one
night
in
april
that
effie
and
the
creeper
and
their
sometime
visitor
met
all
three
in
one
of
those
long
low
smothering
london
halls
where
many
movements
have
originated
which
in
their
developed
proportions
have
taken
possession
of
the
house
of
commons
and
even
stirred
the
dust
in
the
house
of
lords
there
was
a
crowd
of
excited
people
talking
all
degrees
of
sense
and
nonsense
in
every
language
of
the
continent
letters
smuggled
from
the
prison
had
been
received
new
tales
of
torture
were
passing
from
mouth
to
mouth
fresh
propositions
to
arouse
a
general
protest
from
civilization
were
bubbling
up
with
the
anger
of
every
indignant
man
and
woman
drifting
to
the
buzzing
knots
effie
heard
some
one
translating
it
was
the
letter
of
the
tortured
noguès
who
a
month
later
was
shot
beneath
the
fortress
wall
the
words
smote
her
ears
like
something
hot
and
stinging
you
know
i
am
one
of
the
three
accusers
the
other
two
are
ascheri
and
molas
who
figure
in
the
trial
i
could
not
bear
the
atrocious
tortures
of
so
many
days
on
my
arrest
i
spent
eight
days
without
food
or
drink
obliged
to
walk
continually
to
and
fro
or
be
flogged
and
as
if
that
did
not
suffice
i
was
made
to
trot
as
though
i
were
a
horse
trained
at
the
riding
school
until
worn
with
fatigue
i
fell
to
the
ground
then
the
hangmen
burnt
my
lips
with
irons
and
when
i
declared
myself
the
author
of
the
attempt
they
replied
do
not
tell
the
truth
we
know
that
the
author
is
another
one
but
we
want
to
know
your
accomplices
besides
you
still
retain
six
bombs
and
along
with
little
oller
you
deposited
two
bombs
in
the
rue
fivaller
who
are
your
accomplices
in
spite
of
my
desire
to
make
an
end
of
it
i
could
not
answer
anything
whom
should
i
accuse
since
all
are
innocent
finally
six
comrades
were
placed
before
me
whom
i
had
to
accuse
and
of
whom
i
beg
pardon
thus
the
declarations
and
the
accusations
that
i
made
i
can
not
finish
the
hangmen
are
coming
noguès
sick
with
horror
effie
would
have
gone
away
but
her
feet
were
like
lead
she
heard
the
next
letter
the
pathetic
prayer
of
sebastian
sunyer
indistinctly
the
tortures
had
already
seared
her
ears
but
the
crying
for
help
seemed
to
go
up
over
her
head
like
great
sobs
she
felt
herself
washed
round
sinking
in
the
desperate
pain
of
it
the
piteous
reiteration
listen
you
with
your
honest
hearts
you
with
your
pure
souls
good
and
people
good
and
people
wailed
through
her
like
the
wild
pleading
of
a
child
who
shrieking
under
the
whip
dear
papa
good
sweet
papa
please
do
whip
me
please
please
seeks
flattery
to
escape
the
lash
the
last
cry
aid
us
in
our
helplessness
think
of
our
misery
made
her
quiver
like
a
reed
she
walked
away
and
sat
down
in
a
corner
alone
what
could
she
do
what
could
any
one
do
miserable
creature
that
she
was
herself
her
own
misery
seemed
so
worthless
beside
that
prison
cry
and
she
thought
on
why
does
he
want
to
live
at
all
why
does
any
one
want
to
live
why
do
i
want
to
live
myself
after
a
while
the
creeper
and
his
friend
came
to
her
and
the
latter
sat
down
beside
her
undemonstrative
as
usual
at
the
next
buzz
in
the
room
they
two
were
left
alone
she
looked
at
him
once
as
she
said
what
do
you
think
the
people
will
do
about
it
he
glanced
at
the
crowd
with
a
thin
smile
do
talk
in
a
little
time
he
said
quietly
it
does
you
no
good
here
i
will
take
you
home
and
come
back
for
david
afterward
she
had
no
idea
of
contradicting
him
so
they
went
out
together
at
the
threshold
of
her
room
he
said
firmly
i
will
come
in
for
a
few
minutes
i
have
to
speak
to
you
she
struck
a
light
put
the
baby
on
the
bed
and
looked
at
him
questioningly
he
had
sat
down
with
his
back
against
the
wall
and
with
rigidly
folded
arms
stared
straight
ahead
of
him
seeing
that
he
did
not
speak
she
said
softly
falling
into
her
native
dialect
as
all
scotch
women
do
when
they
feel
most
i
canna
get
thae
poor
creetyer
cries
oot
o
ma
head
it
no
human
no
he
said
shortly
and
then
with
a
sudden
look
at
her
effie
what
do
you
think
love
is
she
answered
him
with
surprised
eyes
and
said
nothing
he
went
on
you
love
the
child
do
you
you
do
for
it
you
serve
it
that
shows
you
love
it
but
do
you
think
it
love
that
makes
david
act
as
he
does
to
you
if
he
loved
you
would
he
let
you
work
as
you
work
would
he
live
off
you
would
he
wear
the
flesh
off
his
fingers
instead
of
yours
he
does
love
you
he
is
worth
you
he
is
a
bad
man
but
he
worth
you
and
you
make
him
less
worth
you
ruin
him
you
ruin
yourself
you
kill
the
child
i
ca
see
it
any
more
i
come
here
and
i
see
you
weaker
every
time
whiter
thinner
and
i
know
if
you
keep
on
die
i
ca
see
it
i
want
you
to
leave
him
let
me
work
for
you
i
do
make
much
but
enough
to
let
you
rest
at
least
till
you
are
well
i
would
wait
till
you
left
him
of
yourself
but
i
ca
wait
when
i
see
you
dying
like
this
i
do
want
anything
of
you
except
to
serve
you
to
serve
the
child
because
it
yours
come
away
you
can
have
my
room
i
go
somewhere
else
i
find
you
a
better
place
you
need
see
him
any
more
i
tell
him
myself
he
wo
do
anything
do
be
afraid
come
and
he
stood
up
effie
had
sat
astonished
and
dumb
now
she
looked
up
at
the
dark
tense
eyes
above
her
and
said
quietly
i
dinna
understand
a
sharp
contraction
went
across
the
strong
bent
face
no
you
understand
what
you
are
doing
with
yourself
you
do
understand
that
i
love
you
and
i
ca
see
it
i
do
ask
you
to
love
me
i
ask
you
to
let
me
serve
you
only
a
little
only
so
much
as
to
give
you
health
again
is
that
too
much
you
do
know
what
you
are
to
me
others
love
beauty
but
i
i
see
in
you
the
eternal
sacrifice
your
thin
fingers
that
always
work
your
face
when
i
look
at
it
it
just
a
white
shadow
you
are
the
child
of
the
people
that
dies
without
crying
oh
let
me
give
myself
for
you
and
leave
this
man
who
does
care
for
you
does
know
you
thinks
you
beneath
him
uses
you
i
do
want
you
to
be
his
slave
any
more
effie
clasped
her
hands
and
looked
at
them
then
she
looked
at
the
sleeping
baby
smoothed
the
quilt
and
said
quietly
i
didna
take
him
the
day
to
leave
him
the
morra
it
no
my
fault
if
ye
daft
aboot
me
the
dark
face
sharpened
as
one
sees
the
agony
in
a
dying
man
but
his
voice
was
very
gentle
speaking
always
in
his
blurred
english
no
there
is
no
fault
in
you
at
all
did
i
accuse
you
the
girl
walked
to
the
window
and
looked
out
some
way
it
was
a
relief
from
the
burning
eyes
which
seemed
to
fill
the
room
no
matter
that
she
did
not
look
at
them
and
staring
off
into
the
twinkling
london
night
she
heard
again
the
terrible
sobs
of
sebastian
sunyer
letter
rising
up
and
drowning
her
with
its
misery
without
turning
around
she
said
low
and
hard
i
wonder
ye
can
thenk
aboot
thae
things
an
yon
deils
burnin
men
alive
the
man
drew
his
hand
across
his
forehead
would
you
like
to
hear
that
they
one
the
worst
of
them
was
dead
i
thenk
the
worl
wadna
be
muckle
the
waur
she
answered
still
looking
away
from
him
he
came
up
and
laid
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
will
you
kiss
me
once
i
never
ask
again
she
shook
him
off
i
dinna
feel
then
i
go
back
for
david
and
he
returned
to
the
hall
and
got
the
creeper
and
told
him
very
honestly
what
had
taken
place
and
the
creeper
to
his
credit
be
it
said
respected
him
for
it
and
talked
a
great
deal
about
being
better
in
future
to
the
girl
the
two
men
parted
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
the
last
words
that
echoed
through
the
hallway
were
no
i
am
going
away
but
you
will
hear
of
me
some
day
now
what
went
on
in
his
heart
that
night
no
one
knows
nor
what
indecision
still
kept
him
lingering
fitfully
about
effie
street
a
few
days
more
nor
when
the
indecision
finally
ceased
for
no
one
spoke
to
him
after
that
except
as
casual
acquaintances
meet
and
in
a
week
he
was
gone
but
what
he
did
the
whole
world
knows
for
even
the
queen
of
spain
came
out
of
her
prayers
to
hear
how
her
torturing
prime
minister
had
been
shot
at
santa
agueda
by
a
man
who
when
the
widow
spit
in
his
face
quietly
wiped
his
cheek
saying
madam
i
have
no
quarrel
with
women
a
few
weeks
later
they
garrotted
him
and
he
said
one
word
before
he
died
one
only
germinal
over
there
in
the
long
low
london
hall
the
gabbling
was
hushed
and
some
one
murmured
how
he
had
sat
silent
in
the
corner
that
night
when
all
were
talking
the
creeper
passed
round
a
book
containing
the
history
of
the
tortures
watching
it
jealously
all
the
while
for
said
he
angiolillo
gave
it
to
me
himself
he
had
it
in
his
own
hands
effie
lay
beside
the
baby
in
her
room
and
hid
her
face
in
the
pillow
to
keep
out
the
stare
of
the
burning
eyes
that
were
dead
and
over
and
over
again
she
repeated
was
it
my
fault
was
it
my
fault
the
hot
summer
air
lay
still
and
smothering
and
the
immense
murmur
of
the
city
came
muffled
like
thunder
below
the
horizon
her
heart
seemed
beating
against
the
walls
of
a
padded
room
and
gradually
without
losing
consciousness
she
slipped
into
the
world
of
illusion
around
her
grew
the
stifling
atmosphere
of
the
of
montjuich
and
the
choked
cries
of
men
in
agony
she
was
sure
that
if
she
looked
up
she
should
see
the
demoniac
face
of
portas
the
torturer
she
tried
to
cry
mercy
mercy
but
her
dry
lips
clave
she
had
a
whirling
sensation
and
the
illusion
changed
now
there
was
the
clank
of
soldiers
arms
a
moment
of
insufferable
stillness
as
the
garrotte
shaped
itself
out
of
the
shadows
in
her
eyes
then
loud
and
clear
breaking
the
sullen
quiet
like
the
sharp
ringing
of
a
wind
germinal
she
sprang
up
the
long
vibration
of
the
bell
of
pancras
was
waving
through
the
room
but
to
her
it
was
the
prolongation
of
the
word
then
suddenly
she
threw
out
her
arms
in
the
darkness
and
whispered
hoarsely
ay
i
kiss
ye
the
noo
an
hour
later
she
was
back
at
the
old
question
was
it
my
fault
poor
girl
it
is
all
over
now
and
all
the
same
to
the
grass
that
roots
in
her
bone
whether
it
was
her
fault
or
not
for
the
end
that
the
man
who
had
loved
her
foresaw
came
though
it
was
slow
in
the
coming
let
the
creeper
get
credit
for
all
that
he
did
he
stiffened
up
in
a
year
or
so
and
went
to
paris
and
got
some
work
and
there
the
worn
little
creature
went
to
him
and
wrote
to
her
old
friends
that
she
was
better
off
at
last
but
it
was
too
late
for
that
thin
shell
of
a
body
that
had
starved
so
much
at
the
first
trial
she
broke
and
died
and
so
she
sleeps
and
is
forgotten
and
the
careless
who
mixed
all
these
destinies
up
so
unobservantly
has
never
yet
whispered
her
name
in
the
ear
of
the
widowed
lady
canovas
del
castillo
nor
will
the
birds
that
fly
thither
carry
it
now
for
was
not
effie
the
reward
of
an
apostate
i
have
sinned
and
i
am
rewarded
according
to
my
sin
which
was
great
there
is
no
forgiveness
for
me
let
no
man
think
there
is
forgiveness
for
sin
the
gods
can
not
forgive
this
was
my
sin
and
this
is
my
punishment
that
i
forsook
my
god
to
follow
a
stranger
only
a
while
a
very
brief
brief
while
and
when
i
would
have
returned
there
was
no
more
returning
i
can
not
worship
any
more
that
is
my
punishment
i
can
not
worship
any
more
oh
that
my
god
will
none
of
me
that
is
an
old
sorrow
my
god
was
beauty
and
i
am
all
unbeautiful
and
ever
was
there
is
no
grace
in
these
harsh
limbs
of
mine
nor
was
at
any
time
i
to
whom
the
glory
of
a
lit
eye
was
as
the
shining
of
stars
in
a
deep
well
have
only
dull
and
faded
eyes
and
always
had
the
chiseled
lip
and
chin
whereover
runs
the
radiance
of
life
in
bubbling
gleams
the
cup
of
living
wine
was
never
mine
to
taste
or
kiss
i
am
and
for
my
own
ugliness
sit
in
the
shadow
that
the
sunlight
may
not
see
me
nor
the
beloved
of
my
god
but
once
in
my
hidden
corner
behind
the
curtain
of
shadows
i
blinked
at
the
glory
of
the
world
and
had
such
joy
of
it
as
only
the
ugly
know
sitting
silent
and
worshiping
forgetting
themselves
and
forgotten
here
in
my
brain
it
glowed
the
shimmering
of
the
dying
sun
upon
the
shore
the
long
gold
line
between
the
sand
and
sea
where
the
sliding
foam
caught
fire
and
burned
to
death
here
in
my
brain
it
shone
the
white
moon
on
the
wrinkling
river
running
away
a
dancing
ghost
line
in
the
illimitable
night
here
in
my
brain
rose
the
mountain
curves
the
great
still
world
of
stone
summit
upon
summit
sweeping
skyward
lonely
and
conquering
here
in
my
brain
my
little
brain
behind
this
tiny
ugly
wall
of
bone
stretched
over
with
its
dirty
yellow
skin
glittered
the
far
high
blue
desert
with
its
sand
of
stars
as
i
have
watched
it
nights
and
nights
alone
hid
in
the
shadows
of
the
prairie
grass
here
rolled
and
swelled
the
seas
of
corn
and
blossoming
fields
of
nodding
bloom
and
on
their
hovering
wings
went
flickering
up
and
down
and
the
quick
spring
of
things
went
scattering
dew
across
the
sun
and
singing
streams
went
shining
down
the
rocks
spreading
bright
veils
upon
the
crags
here
in
my
brain
my
silent
unrevealing
brain
were
the
eyes
i
loved
the
lips
i
dared
not
kiss
the
sculptured
heads
and
tendriled
hair
they
were
here
always
in
my
my
house
of
beauty
the
temple
of
my
god
i
shut
the
door
on
common
life
and
worshiped
here
and
no
bright
living
flying
thing
in
whose
body
beauty
dwells
as
guest
can
guess
the
ecstatic
joy
of
a
brown
silent
creature
a
squatting
on
the
shadowed
ground
motionless
thrilling
with
the
presence
of
though
it
has
no
part
therein
but
the
gods
are
many
and
once
a
strange
god
came
to
me
sharp
upon
the
shadowy
ground
he
stood
and
beckoned
me
with
knotted
fingers
there
was
no
beauty
in
his
lean
figure
and
sunken
cheeks
but
up
and
down
the
muscles
ran
like
snakes
beneath
his
skin
and
his
dark
eyes
had
somber
fires
in
them
and
as
i
looked
at
him
i
felt
the
leap
of
prisoned
forces
in
myself
in
the
earth
in
the
air
in
the
sun
all
throbbed
with
the
pulse
of
the
wild
god
heart
beauty
vanished
from
my
and
where
his
images
had
been
i
heard
the
clang
and
roar
of
machinery
the
forging
of
links
that
stretched
to
the
sun
chains
for
the
tides
chains
for
the
winds
and
curious
lights
went
shining
through
thick
walls
as
through
air
and
down
through
the
shell
of
the
world
itself
to
the
great
furnaces
within
into
those
seething
depths
the
god
eyes
peered
smiling
and
triumphing
then
with
an
at
the
sky
and
a
at
me
he
strode
off
this
is
my
great
sin
for
which
there
is
no
pardon
i
followed
him
the
rude
god
energy
followed
him
and
in
that
abandoned
moment
swore
to
be
quit
of
beauty
which
had
given
me
nothing
and
to
be
worshiper
of
him
to
whom
i
was
akin
ugly
but
sinuous
resolute
daring
defiant
maker
and
breaker
of
things
remoulder
of
the
world
i
followed
him
i
would
have
run
abreast
with
him
i
loved
him
not
with
that
still
ecstasy
of
flooding
joy
wherewith
my
own
god
filled
me
of
old
but
with
impetuous
eager
fires
that
burned
and
beat
through
all
the
of
me
i
love
you
love
me
back
i
cried
and
would
have
flung
myself
upon
his
neck
then
he
turned
on
me
with
a
ruthless
blow
and
fled
away
over
the
world
leaving
me
crippled
stricken
powerless
a
fierce
pain
driving
through
my
veins
gusts
of
pain
and
i
crept
back
into
my
old
cavern
stumbling
blind
and
deaf
only
for
the
haunting
vision
of
my
shame
and
the
rushing
sound
of
fevered
blood
the
pain
is
gone
i
see
again
i
care
no
more
for
the
taunt
and
blow
of
that
fierce
god
who
was
never
mine
but
in
my
it
is
all
still
and
bare
no
image
lingers
on
the
blank
mirrors
any
more
no
singing
bell
floats
in
the
echoless
dome
forms
rise
and
pass
but
neither
mountain
curve
nor
sand
nor
sea
nor
shivering
river
nor
the
faces
of
the
flowers
nor
flowering
faces
of
my
god
beloved
touch
aught
within
me
now
not
one
poor
thrill
of
vague
delight
for
me
who
felt
the
glory
of
the
stars
within
my
finger
tips
it
slips
past
me
like
water
brown
without
and
clay
within
no
wonder
now
behind
the
ugly
wall
an
empty
temple
i
can
not
worship
i
can
not
love
i
can
not
care
all
my
is
unweighed
against
that
faithless
hour
of
my
forswearing
it
is
just
it
is
the
law
i
am
forsworn
and
the
gods
have
given
me
the
reward
of
an
apostate
at
the
end
of
the
alley
it
is
a
long
narrow
pocket
opening
on
a
little
street
which
runs
like
a
tortuous
seam
up
and
down
the
city
over
there
it
was
at
the
end
of
the
summer
and
in
summer
in
the
evening
the
mouth
of
the
pocket
is
hard
to
find
because
of
the
people
in
it
and
about
who
sit
across
the
passage
gasping
at
the
dirty
winds
that
come
loafing
down
the
street
like
crafty
beggars
seeking
a
hole
to
sleep
in
like
mean
beggars
bereft
of
the
spirit
of
free
windhood
down
in
the
pocket
itself
the
air
is
quite
dead
one
feels
oneself
enveloped
in
a
pool
of
it
and
at
every
breath
long
filaments
of
invisible
roots
tear
and
tangle
in
your
floundering
lungs
i
had
to
go
to
the
very
end
to
the
bottom
of
the
pocket
there
in
the
deepest
of
these
lives
the
woman
to
whom
i
am
indebted
for
the
whiteness
of
this
waist
i
wear
how
she
does
it
i
do
know
poverty
works
miracles
like
that
just
as
the
black
marsh
mud
gives
out
lilies
at
the
very
last
door
i
knocked
and
presently
a
man
voice
weak
and
suffocated
called
from
a
window
above
i
there
a
chair
there
sit
down
she
be
home
soon
and
the
voice
was
caught
in
a
cough
this
then
was
the
consumptive
husband
she
had
told
me
of
i
looked
up
at
the
square
hole
dimly
outlined
in
the
darkness
whence
the
cough
issued
and
suddenly
felt
a
horrible
pressure
at
my
heart
and
a
curious
sense
of
entanglement
as
if
all
the
invisible
webs
of
disease
had
momentarily
acquired
a
conscious
sense
of
prey
within
their
clutch
and
tightened
on
it
like
an
octopus
the
haunting
terror
of
the
unknown
the
dim
horror
of
an
inimic
presence
recoil
before
the
merciless
creeping
and
floating
of
an
enemy
one
can
not
grasp
or
fight
repulsive
turning
from
a
thing
that
has
reached
behind
while
you
have
been
seeking
to
face
it
that
is
there
awaiting
you
with
the
frightful
ironic
laughter
of
the
silence
all
this
swept
round
and
through
me
as
i
stared
up
through
the
night
up
there
on
the
bed
he
was
lying
he
who
had
been
meshed
in
the
fatal
web
for
three
long
years
and
was
struggling
still
in
the
darkness
i
felt
his
breath
draw
the
sharp
barking
of
a
dog
came
as
a
relief
i
turned
to
the
broken
chair
and
sat
down
to
wait
the
alley
was
hemmed
in
by
a
high
wall
and
from
the
farther
side
of
it
there
towered
up
four
magnificent
old
trees
whose
great
crowns
sent
down
a
whispering
legend
of
vanished
forests
and
the
limitless
sweep
of
clean
air
that
had
washed
through
them
long
ago
and
that
would
never
come
again
how
long
how
long
since
those
far
days
of
purity
before
the
plague
spot
of
man
had
crept
upon
them
how
strong
those
proud
old
giants
were
that
had
not
yet
been
strangled
how
beautiful
they
were
how
mean
and
ugly
were
the
misshapen
things
that
sat
in
the
doorways
of
the
foul
dens
that
they
had
made
chattering
chattering
as
ages
ago
the
apes
had
chattered
in
the
forest
what
curious
beasts
they
were
with
their
paws
and
heads
sticking
out
of
the
coverings
they
had
twisted
round
their
bodies
chattering
chattering
always
and
always
moving
about
unable
to
understand
the
still
strong
growths
of
silence
so
a
half
hour
passed
at
last
i
saw
a
parting
in
the
group
of
bodies
across
the
entrance
of
the
pocket
and
a
familiar
weary
figure
carrying
a
basket
coming
down
the
brickway
she
stopped
half
way
where
a
widening
of
the
alley
furnished
the
common
drying
place
and
a
number
of
clothes
lines
crossed
and
recrossed
each
other
casting
a
net
of
shadows
on
the
pavement
after
a
glance
at
the
sky
which
had
clouded
over
she
sighed
heavily
and
again
advanced
in
the
sickly
light
of
the
alley
lamp
the
rounded
shoulders
seemed
to
droop
like
an
old
crone
yet
the
woman
was
still
young
that
she
might
not
be
startled
i
called
good
evening
the
answer
was
spoken
in
that
tone
of
forced
cheerfulness
which
the
wretched
always
give
to
their
employers
but
she
sank
upon
the
step
with
the
habitual
my
but
i
glad
to
sit
down
of
one
who
seldom
sits
tired
out
i
suppose
the
day
has
been
so
hot
yes
and
i
got
to
go
to
work
and
iron
again
till
eleven
and
it
awful
hot
in
that
kitchen
i
do
mind
the
washing
so
much
in
summer
i
wash
out
here
but
it
hot
ironing
are
you
in
a
hurry
i
said
no
and
sat
on
how
much
rent
do
you
pay
i
asked
seven
dollars
three
rooms
yes
one
over
the
other
yes
it
an
awful
rent
and
he
wo
fix
anything
the
door
is
half
off
its
hinges
and
the
paper
is
a
sight
have
you
lived
here
long
over
three
years
we
moved
here
before
he
got
sick
i
do
keep
nothing
right
now
but
it
used
to
be
nice
it
so
quiet
back
here
away
from
the
street
you
do
hear
no
noise
that
fence
ought
to
be
whitewashed
i
used
to
keep
it
white
and
everything
clean
and
it
was
so
nice
to
sit
out
here
in
summer
under
them
trees
you
could
just
think
you
were
in
the
park
a
curious
wonder
went
through
me
somewhere
back
in
me
a
voice
was
saying
to
him
that
hath
shall
be
given
and
from
him
that
hath
not
it
shall
be
taken
away
even
that
which
he
hath
this
horrible
pool
had
been
nice
to
her
again
i
felt
the
abyss
seizing
me
with
its
tentacles
and
high
overhead
in
the
i
seemed
to
hear
a
spectral
mockery
of
laughter
yes
i
forced
myself
to
say
they
are
splendid
trees
i
wonder
they
have
lived
so
long
is
funny
aint
it
that
a
great
big
yard
in
there
the
man
that
used
to
own
it
was
a
gardener
and
there
a
lot
of
the
curiousest
flowers
there
yet
but
he
dead
now
and
the
folks
that
got
it
keep
up
nothing
they
waiting
to
sell
it
i
suppose
above
over
our
heads
the
racking
cough
sounded
again
aint
it
terrible
she
murmured
day
and
night
day
and
night
he
do
get
no
rest
and
neither
do
i
it
no
wonder
some
people
commits
suicide
does
he
ever
speak
of
it
i
asked
her
voice
dropped
to
a
not
now
so
much
since
the
church
people
got
hold
of
him
he
used
to
i
think
he
a
done
it
if
it
had
been
for
them
but
they
been
kind
o
talkin
to
him
lately
and
tellin
him
it
be
right
on
account
of
the
insurance
you
know
my
heart
gave
a
wild
bound
of
revolt
and
i
shut
my
teeth
fast
o
man
man
what
have
you
made
of
yourself
more
stupid
than
all
the
beasts
of
the
earth
for
a
dole
of
the
things
you
make
to
be
robbed
of
living
to
be
robbed
of
and
poisoned
with
you
consent
to
the
death
that
eats
with
a
million
mouths
eats
inexorably
you
submit
to
unnamable
torture
in
the
holy
name
of
insurance
and
in
the
name
of
insurance
this
miserable
woman
keeps
alive
the
bones
of
a
man
i
took
my
bundle
and
went
and
all
the
way
i
felt
myself
tearing
through
the
tendrils
of
death
that
hung
and
swayed
from
the
noisome
wall
and
caught
at
things
as
they
passed
and
all
the
way
there
pressed
upon
me
pictures
of
the
skeleton
and
the
woman
clothed
in
firm
flesh
young
and
joyous
and
thrilling
with
the
love
of
the
well
and
strong
ah
if
some
one
had
said
to
her
then
some
day
you
will
slave
to
keep
him
alive
through
fruitless
agonies
that
for
your
last
reward
you
may
take
the
price
of
his
pain
alone
i
was
wrong
i
thought
she
wanted
the
insurance
money
but
i
misunderstood
her
i
found
it
out
one
wild
october
day
more
than
a
year
later
when
for
the
second
time
i
sought
the
end
of
the
alley
the
sufferer
had
suffered
out
the
gaunt
and
wasted
shell
of
the
man
lay
no
more
by
the
window
in
the
upper
story
the
woman
was
free
rest
at
last
i
thought
for
both
of
them
but
it
was
not
as
i
thought
i
expected
ease
to
come
into
the
woman
drawn
face
and
relaxation
to
her
stooping
figure
but
something
else
came
upon
both
something
quite
unwonted
and
inexplicable
a
wandering
look
in
the
eyes
a
stupid
drop
to
the
mouth
an
uncertainty
in
her
walk
as
of
one
who
is
half
minded
to
go
back
and
look
for
something
there
was
too
an
irritating
irregularity
in
the
performance
of
her
work
which
began
to
be
annoying
at
last
on
that
october
day
this
new
unreliability
reached
the
limit
of
provocation
i
was
leaving
the
city
i
needed
my
laundry
needed
it
at
once
and
here
it
was
four
in
the
afternoon
the
train
due
at
night
and
packing
impossible
till
the
wash
came
it
was
five
days
overdue
the
wind
was
howling
furiously
the
rain
driving
in
sheets
but
there
was
no
alternative
i
must
get
to
the
end
of
the
alley
and
back
somehow
the
gray
atmosphere
was
still
grayer
in
the
alley
still
still
grayer
at
the
end
and
what
with
the
gray
of
it
and
the
rain
of
it
i
could
scarcely
see
the
thing
that
sat
facing
me
when
i
opened
the
door
a
sort
of
human
blur
hunched
in
a
its
head
sunken
on
its
breast
in
response
to
my
startled
exclamation
the
face
was
lifted
vacantly
for
a
second
and
then
dropped
again
but
i
had
seen
drunk
dead
drunk
and
this
woman
had
never
drunk
i
looked
around
the
wretched
room
by
the
window
where
the
gray
light
trailed
in
stood
a
table
covered
with
unwashed
dishes
some
late
flies
were
crawling
in
the
gutters
of
slop
besotted
derelicts
of
insects
stupidly
staggering
up
and
down
the
cracked
china
on
the
stove
stood
a
number
of
but
there
was
no
fire
a
mass
of
unironed
clothes
lay
on
an
old
couch
and
over
the
backs
of
two
unoccupied
chairs
on
the
wall
above
the
couch
hung
the
portrait
of
the
dead
man
i
walked
to
the
slumping
figure
in
the
rocker
and
with
brutality
demanded
so
this
is
why
you
did
not
bring
my
clothes
where
are
they
i
heard
my
own
voice
cutting
like
the
edge
of
a
knife
and
felt
when
that
weak
shaking
thing
lifted
up
its
foolish
face
and
stared
at
me
with
watery
uncomprehending
eyes
my
clothes
i
reiterated
are
they
here
or
upstairs
stammered
the
uncertain
voice
so
nothing
for
it
but
to
find
them
myself
i
muttered
beginning
the
search
through
the
pile
on
the
couch
nothing
of
mine
there
so
i
needs
must
climb
to
the
golgotha
on
the
second
floor
from
which
the
cross
had
disappeared
but
which
still
bore
traces
of
its
victim
long
crucifixion
a
pair
of
old
still
by
the
window
a
on
the
wall
some
can
not
but
leave
so
the
things
that
have
touched
their
dead
one
by
one
i
found
the
garments
here
there
in
the
hallway
in
the
garret
hanging
or
crumpled
up
among
dozens
of
others
and
all
the
while
i
hunted
the
rain
beat
and
the
wind
blew
and
a
low
third
sound
kept
mingling
with
them
rising
from
the
lower
floor
my
heart
smote
me
when
i
heard
it
for
i
knew
it
was
the
woman
sobbing
the
pharisee
within
me
gave
an
impatient
sneer
alcohol
tears
but
something
else
clutched
at
my
throat
and
i
found
myself
glancing
at
the
dead
man
shoes
when
i
went
downstairs
i
avoided
the
tied
up
my
bundle
counted
out
the
money
laid
it
on
the
table
and
then
turning
round
said
deliberately
and
harshly
there
is
your
money
do
buy
whisky
with
it
mrs
bossert
crying
had
a
little
sobered
her
she
looked
up
still
with
less
light
in
her
face
than
in
an
intelligent
dog
but
with
some
dim
it
was
as
a
face
that
had
appeared
behind
deforming
bubbles
of
water
she
half
lifted
her
hand
let
it
fall
and
stammered
no
i
wo
i
wo
it
do
do
nobody
no
good
the
senseless
desire
to
preach
seized
hold
of
me
bossert
i
cried
out
are
you
ashamed
of
yourself
a
woman
like
you
who
went
through
so
much
and
so
long
and
so
bravely
and
now
when
you
could
get
along
all
right
to
act
like
this
the
soggy
mouth
dropped
open
the
glazy
eyes
stared
at
me
fixedly
and
foolishly
then
shifted
to
the
portrait
on
the
wall
and
with
a
mawkish
simper
as
of
some
old
drab
playing
sixteen
she
slobbered
out
nodding
to
the
portrait
all
for
the
love
o
him
it
was
so
utterly
ludicrous
that
i
laughed
then
a
cold
rage
took
me
look
here
i
said
and
again
i
heard
my
own
voice
grim
and
quiet
cutting
the
air
like
a
whip
if
you
believe
as
i
have
heard
you
say
that
your
husband
can
look
down
on
you
from
anywhere
remember
you
could
do
a
thing
to
hurt
him
worse
than
you
doing
now
indeed
the
lash
went
home
the
stricken
figure
huddled
closer
the
voice
came
out
like
a
dumb
thing
moan
oh
i
all
alone
then
suddenly
i
understood
i
had
taken
it
for
mockery
and
profanation
that
leering
look
at
the
shadow
on
the
wall
that
driveling
stammer
all
for
the
love
o
him
and
it
had
been
a
solemn
thing
no
word
spoken
in
the
morning
of
youth
with
the
untried
day
before
it
under
the
seductive
witchery
of
answering
breath
and
kisses
rushing
blood
and
throbbing
bodies
but
the
word
of
a
woman
bent
with
service
seamed
with
labor
haggard
with
watching
the
word
of
a
woman
who
at
the
washtub
had
kept
her
sufferer
by
the
work
of
her
hands
and
watched
him
between
the
snatches
of
her
sleep
the
immemorial
passion
of
a
common
heart
that
not
much
that
not
much
and
has
lost
all
years
were
in
it
for
years
she
had
had
her
burden
to
carry
and
she
had
carried
it
to
the
edge
of
the
grave
there
it
had
fallen
from
her
and
her
arms
were
empty
nothing
to
do
any
more
alone
she
sat
up
suddenly
with
a
momentary
flare
of
light
in
her
as
long
as
i
had
him
she
said
i
could
do
i
thought
i
be
glad
when
he
was
gone
a
many
and
many
a
time
but
i
rather
he
was
up
there
yet
i
did
everything
i
did
put
him
away
mean
there
was
a
hundred
and
dollars
insurance
i
spent
it
all
on
him
he
was
covered
with
flowers
the
flare
died
down
and
she
fell
together
like
a
collapsing
bag
i
saw
the
gray
vacancy
moving
inward
toward
the
last
spark
of
intelligence
in
her
eyes
as
an
ashing
coal
whitens
inward
toward
the
last
dull
red
point
of
fire
then
this
heap
of
rags
shuddered
with
an
inhuman
whine
in
the
crowding
shadows
i
felt
the
desolation
pressing
me
like
a
vise
behind
that
sunken
heap
in
the
chair
gathered
a
midnight
specter
for
a
moment
i
caught
a
flash
from
its
royal
malignant
eyes
the
monarch
of
human
ruins
the
murderous
bridegroom
of
widowed
souls
king
alcohol
after
all
as
well
that
way
as
another
i
muttered
and
aloud
but
the
had
gone
out
of
my
voice
the
money
is
on
the
table
she
did
not
hear
me
the
bridegroom
had
given
his
beloved
sleep
i
went
out
softly
into
the
wild
rain
and
overhead
among
the
lashing
arms
of
the
leafless
trees
and
around
the
alley
pocket
the
wind
was
whining
to
strive
and
fail
there
was
a
lonely
wind
crying
around
the
house
and
wailing
away
through
the
twilight
like
a
child
that
has
been
refused
and
gone
off
crying
every
now
and
then
the
trees
shivered
with
it
and
dropped
a
few
leaves
that
splashed
against
the
windows
like
big
soft
tears
and
then
fell
down
on
the
dark
dying
grass
and
lay
there
till
the
next
wind
rose
and
whirled
them
away
rain
was
gathering
close
by
the
gray
patch
of
light
within
the
room
a
white
face
bent
over
a
small
table
and
fingers
swept
across
the
strings
of
a
zither
the
low
pathetic
opening
chords
of
albert
wailed
for
a
moment
like
the
wind
then
a
false
note
sounded
and
the
player
threw
her
arms
across
the
table
and
rested
her
face
upon
them
what
was
the
use
she
knew
how
it
ought
to
be
but
she
could
never
do
it
never
make
the
strings
strike
true
to
the
song
that
was
sounding
within
sounding
as
the
wind
and
the
rain
and
the
falling
leaves
sounded
it
as
long
ago
the
wizard
albert
had
heard
and
conjured
it
out
of
the
before
the
little
black
notes
that
carried
the
message
over
the
world
were
written
the
weary
brain
wandered
away
over
the
mystery
of
the
notes
and
she
whispered
dully
a
sign
to
the
eye
and
a
sound
to
the
ear
and
that
is
his
gift
to
the
world
his
will
and
he
is
dead
dead
dead
he
was
so
great
and
they
are
so
silly
those
little
black
foolish
dots
and
yet
they
are
there
and
by
them
his
soul
sings
the
numb
pain
at
her
heart
forced
some
sharp
tears
from
the
closed
eyes
she
bent
and
unbent
her
fingers
hopelessly
two
or
three
times
and
then
let
them
lie
out
flat
and
still
it
was
not
their
fault
not
the
fingers
fault
they
could
learn
to
do
it
if
they
only
had
the
chance
but
they
could
never
never
have
the
chance
they
must
always
do
something
else
always
a
hundred
other
things
first
always
save
and
spare
and
patch
and
contrive
there
was
never
time
to
do
the
thing
she
longed
for
most
only
the
odd
moments
the
unexpected
freedoms
the
stolen
in
which
to
live
one
highest
dream
only
the
castaway
time
for
one
soul
and
every
year
the
fleeting
glory
waned
wavered
sunk
away
more
and
more
sorrowfully
into
the
gray
soundless
shadows
of
an
unlived
life
once
she
had
heard
it
so
clearly
long
ago
on
the
fields
of
home
the
wild
sweet
choruses
the
songs
no
man
had
ever
sung
still
she
heard
them
sometimes
in
the
twilight
in
the
night
when
she
sat
alone
and
work
was
over
high
and
thin
and
fading
only
but
still
with
the
incomparable
glory
of
a
first
revelation
a
song
no
one
else
has
ever
heard
a
marvel
to
be
seized
and
bodied
only
they
faded
away
into
the
nodding
sleep
that
would
conquer
and
in
the
light
and
rush
of
day
were
mournfully
silent
and
she
never
captured
them
never
would
life
was
half
over
now
with
the
thought
she
started
up
struck
the
chords
again
a
world
of
plaint
throbbing
through
the
strings
surely
the
wizard
himself
would
have
been
satisfied
but
ah
once
more
the
fatal
uncertainty
of
the
fingers
she
bit
the
left
hand
savagely
then
touched
it
softly
and
remorsefully
with
the
other
murmuring
poor
fingers
not
your
fault
at
last
she
rose
and
stood
at
the
window
looking
out
into
the
night
and
thinking
of
the
ruined
gift
the
noblest
gift
that
had
been
hers
and
would
die
dumb
thinking
of
the
messages
that
had
come
to
her
up
out
of
the
silent
dark
and
sunk
back
into
it
unsounded
of
the
voices
she
would
have
given
to
the
messages
of
the
masters
and
never
would
give
now
and
with
a
bitter
compression
of
the
lips
she
said
well
i
was
born
to
strive
and
fail
and
suddenly
a
rush
of
feeling
swept
her
own
life
out
of
sight
and
away
out
in
the
deepening
night
she
saw
the
face
of
an
old
dead
man
he
had
been
her
father
once
strong
and
young
with
chestnut
hair
and
gleaming
eyes
and
with
his
own
dream
of
what
he
had
to
do
in
life
perhaps
he
too
had
heard
sounds
singing
in
the
air
a
new
message
waiting
for
deliverance
it
was
all
over
now
he
had
grown
old
and
and
white
and
had
never
done
anything
in
the
world
at
least
nothing
for
himself
his
very
own
he
had
sewn
clothes
thousands
millions
of
stitches
in
his
life
no
doubt
there
were
still
in
existence
scraps
and
fragments
of
his
work
in
same
old
ragbag
perhaps
beautiful
fine
stitches
into
which
the
keen
eyesight
and
the
deft
hand
had
passed
still
showing
the
but
was
not
his
work
that
was
the
service
society
had
asked
of
him
and
he
had
rendered
himself
his
own
soul
that
wherein
he
was
different
from
other
men
the
unbought
thing
that
the
soul
does
for
its
own
outpouring
that
was
nowhere
and
over
there
among
the
low
mounds
of
the
soldiers
graves
his
bed
was
made
and
he
was
lying
in
it
straight
and
still
with
the
rain
crying
softly
above
him
he
had
been
so
full
of
the
lust
of
life
so
alert
so
active
and
nothing
of
it
all
poor
father
you
failed
too
she
muttered
softly
and
then
behind
the
wraith
of
the
dead
man
there
rose
an
older
picture
a
face
she
had
never
seen
dead
fifty
years
before
but
it
shone
through
the
other
face
and
outshone
it
luminous
with
great
suffering
much
overcoming
and
complete
and
final
failure
it
was
the
face
of
a
woman
not
yet
smitten
with
death
with
the
horror
of
utter
strangeness
in
the
dying
eyes
the
face
of
a
woman
lost
in
a
strange
city
of
a
strange
land
and
with
her
little
crying
helpless
children
about
her
facing
the
inexorable
agony
there
on
the
pavement
where
she
was
sinking
down
and
only
foreign
words
falling
in
the
dying
ears
she
too
had
striven
how
she
had
striven
against
the
abyss
of
poverty
there
in
the
old
world
against
the
load
laid
on
her
by
nature
law
society
the
triune
god
of
terror
against
the
inertia
of
another
will
she
had
bought
coppers
with
blood
and
spared
and
saved
and
endured
and
waited
she
had
bent
the
gods
to
her
will
she
had
sent
her
husband
to
america
the
land
of
freedom
and
promise
she
had
followed
him
at
last
over
the
great
blue
bitter
water
with
its
lapping
mouths
that
had
devoured
one
of
her
little
ones
upon
the
way
she
had
been
driven
like
a
cow
in
the
shambles
at
the
landing
stage
she
had
been
robbed
of
all
but
her
ticket
and
with
her
little
children
had
hungered
for
three
days
on
the
overland
journey
she
had
lived
it
through
and
set
foot
in
the
promised
land
but
somehow
the
waiting
face
was
not
there
had
missed
her
or
she
him
and
lost
and
alone
with
death
and
the
starving
babes
she
sank
at
the
foot
of
the
soldiers
monument
and
the
black
mist
came
down
on
the
courageous
eyes
and
the
light
was
flickering
out
forever
with
a
bitter
cry
the
living
figure
in
the
room
stretched
its
hands
toward
the
vision
in
the
night
there
was
nothing
there
she
knew
it
nothing
in
the
heavens
above
nor
the
earth
beneath
to
hear
the
cry
not
so
much
as
a
crumbling
bone
any
more
but
she
called
brokenly
oh
why
must
she
die
so
with
nothing
nothing
not
one
little
reward
after
all
that
struggle
to
fall
on
the
pavement
and
die
in
the
hospital
at
last
and
shuddering
with
covered
eyes
and
heavy
breath
she
added
wearily
no
wonder
that
i
fail
i
come
of
those
who
failed
my
father
his
mother
and
before
her
behind
the
fading
picture
stretched
dim
long
shadows
of
silent
generations
with
rounded
shoulders
and
bent
backs
and
sullen
conquered
faces
and
they
had
all
most
likely
dreamed
of
some
wonderful
thing
they
had
to
do
in
the
world
and
all
had
died
and
left
it
undone
and
their
work
had
been
washed
away
as
if
writ
in
water
and
no
one
knew
their
dreams
and
of
the
fruit
of
their
toil
other
men
had
eaten
for
that
was
the
will
of
the
triune
god
but
of
themselves
was
left
no
trace
no
sound
no
word
in
the
world
glory
no
carving
upon
stone
no
indomitable
ghost
shining
from
a
written
sign
no
song
singing
out
of
black
foolish
spots
on
paper
nothing
they
were
as
though
they
had
not
been
and
as
they
all
had
died
she
too
would
die
slave
of
the
triple
terror
sacrificing
the
highest
to
the
meanest
that
somewhere
in
some
lighted
or
theater
some
piece
of
vacant
flesh
might
wear
one
more
jewel
in
her
painted
hair
my
soul
she
said
bitterly
my
soul
for
their
diamonds
it
was
time
to
sleep
for
work
the
sorrows
of
the
body
i
have
never
wanted
anything
more
than
the
wild
creatures
have
a
broad
waft
of
clean
air
a
day
to
lie
on
the
grass
at
times
with
nothing
to
do
but
slip
the
blades
through
my
fingers
and
look
as
long
as
i
pleased
at
the
whole
blue
arch
and
the
screens
of
green
and
white
between
leave
for
a
month
to
float
and
float
along
the
salt
crests
and
among
the
foam
or
roll
with
my
naked
skin
over
a
clean
long
stretch
of
sunshiny
sand
food
that
i
liked
straight
from
the
cool
ground
and
time
to
taste
its
sweetness
and
time
to
rest
after
tasting
sleep
when
it
came
and
stillness
that
the
sleep
might
leave
me
when
it
would
not
sooner
air
room
light
rest
nakedness
when
i
would
not
be
clothed
and
when
i
would
be
clothed
garments
that
did
not
fetter
freedom
to
touch
my
mother
earth
to
be
with
her
in
storm
and
shine
as
the
wild
things
are
this
is
what
i
wanted
this
and
free
contact
with
my
fellows
not
to
love
and
lie
and
be
ashamed
but
to
love
and
say
i
love
and
be
glad
of
it
to
feel
the
currents
of
ten
thousand
years
of
passion
flooding
me
body
to
body
as
the
wild
things
meet
i
have
asked
no
more
but
i
have
not
received
over
me
there
sits
that
pitiless
tyrant
the
soul
and
i
am
nothing
it
has
driven
me
to
the
city
where
the
air
is
fever
and
fire
and
said
breathe
this
i
would
learn
i
can
not
learn
in
the
empty
fields
temples
are
here
stay
and
when
my
poor
stifled
lungs
have
panted
till
it
seemed
my
chest
must
burst
the
soul
has
said
i
will
allow
you
then
an
hour
or
two
we
will
ride
and
i
will
take
my
book
and
read
meanwhile
and
when
my
eyes
have
cried
out
with
tears
of
pain
for
the
brief
vision
of
freedom
drifting
by
only
for
leave
to
look
at
the
great
green
and
blue
an
hour
after
the
long
horror
of
walls
the
soul
has
said
i
can
not
waste
the
time
altogether
i
must
know
read
and
when
my
ears
have
plead
for
the
singing
of
the
crickets
and
the
music
of
the
night
the
soul
has
answered
no
gongs
and
whistles
and
shrieks
are
unpleasant
if
you
listen
but
school
yourself
to
hearken
to
the
spiritual
voice
and
it
will
not
matter
when
i
have
beat
against
my
narrow
confines
of
brick
and
mortar
brick
and
mortar
the
soul
has
said
miserable
slave
why
are
you
not
as
i
who
in
one
moment
fly
to
the
utterest
universe
it
matters
not
where
you
are
am
free
when
i
would
have
slept
so
that
the
lids
fell
heavily
and
i
could
not
lift
them
the
soul
has
struck
me
with
a
lash
crying
awake
drink
some
stimulant
for
those
shrinking
nerves
of
yours
there
is
no
time
to
sleep
till
the
work
is
done
and
the
cursed
poison
worked
upon
me
till
will
was
done
when
i
would
have
dallied
over
my
food
the
soul
has
ordered
hurry
hurry
do
i
have
time
to
waste
on
this
disgusting
scene
fill
yourself
and
be
gone
when
i
have
envied
the
very
dog
rubbing
its
bare
back
along
the
ground
in
the
sunlight
the
soul
has
exclaimed
would
you
degrade
me
so
far
as
to
put
yourself
on
a
level
with
beasts
and
my
bands
were
drawn
tighter
when
i
have
looked
upon
my
kind
and
longed
to
embrace
them
hungered
wildly
for
the
press
of
arms
and
lips
the
soul
has
commanded
sternly
cease
vile
creature
of
fleshly
lusts
eternal
reproach
will
you
forever
shame
me
with
your
beastliness
and
i
have
always
yielded
mute
joyless
fettered
i
have
trod
the
world
of
the
soul
choosing
and
served
and
been
unrewarded
now
i
am
broken
before
my
time
bloodless
sleepless
breathless
racked
at
every
joint
trembling
with
every
leaf
perhaps
i
have
been
too
hard
said
the
soul
you
shall
have
a
rest
the
boon
has
come
too
late
the
roses
are
beneath
my
feet
now
but
the
perfume
does
not
reach
me
the
willows
trail
across
my
cheek
and
the
great
arch
is
overhead
but
my
eyes
are
too
weary
to
lift
to
it
the
wind
is
upon
my
face
but
i
can
not
bare
my
throat
to
its
caress
vaguely
i
hear
the
singing
of
the
night
through
the
long
watches
when
sleep
does
not
come
but
the
answering
vibration
thrills
no
more
hands
touch
mine
i
longed
for
them
so
once
but
i
am
as
a
corpse
i
remember
that
i
wanted
all
these
things
but
now
the
power
to
want
is
crushed
from
me
and
only
the
memory
of
my
denial
throbs
on
with
its
pain
and
still
i
think
if
i
were
left
alone
long
enough
but
already
i
hear
the
tyrant
up
there
plotting
to
slay
yes
it
keeps
saying
it
is
about
time
i
will
not
be
chained
to
a
rotting
carcass
if
my
days
are
to
pass
in
perpetual
idleness
i
may
as
well
be
annihilated
i
will
make
the
wretch
do
me
one
more
you
have
clamored
to
be
naked
in
the
water
go
now
and
lie
in
it
forever
yes
that
is
what
it
is
saying
and
i
the
sea
stretches
down
there
the
triumph
of
youth
the
afternoon
blazed
and
glittered
along
the
motionless
and
down
into
the
yellow
dust
of
the
road
under
the
shadows
of
the
trees
among
the
powdered
grass
and
bushes
sat
a
woman
and
a
man
the
man
was
young
and
handsome
in
a
way
with
a
lean
eager
face
and
burning
eyes
a
forehead
in
the
old
poetic
mould
crowned
by
loose
dark
waves
of
hair
his
chin
was
long
his
lips
parted
devouringly
and
his
glances
seemed
to
eat
his
companion
face
it
was
not
a
pretty
face
not
even
ordinarily
good
looking
sallow
not
young
only
youngish
but
there
was
a
peculiar
mobility
about
it
that
made
one
notice
it
she
waved
her
hand
slowly
from
east
to
west
indicating
the
horizon
and
said
dreamingly
how
wide
it
is
how
far
it
is
one
can
get
one
breath
in
the
city
i
always
feel
that
the
walls
are
squeezing
my
chest
after
a
little
silence
she
asked
without
looking
at
him
what
are
you
thinking
of
bernard
you
he
murmured
she
glanced
at
him
under
her
lids
musingly
stretched
out
her
hand
and
touched
his
eyelids
with
her
and
turned
aside
with
a
curious
fleeting
smile
he
caught
at
her
hand
but
failing
to
touch
it
as
she
drew
it
away
bit
his
lip
and
forcedly
looked
off
at
the
sky
and
the
landscape
yes
he
said
in
a
strained
voice
it
is
beautiful
after
the
city
i
wish
we
could
stay
in
it
the
woman
sighed
that
what
i
have
been
wishing
for
the
last
fifteen
years
he
bent
towards
her
eagerly
do
you
think
he
stopped
and
stammered
you
know
we
have
been
planning
a
few
of
us
to
club
together
and
get
a
little
farm
somewhere
near
would
you
do
you
think
would
you
be
one
of
us
she
laughed
a
little
low
sad
laugh
i
would
be
any
good
you
know
i
could
do
the
work
that
ought
to
be
done
i
would
come
fast
enough
and
i
would
try
but
i
a
little
too
old
bernard
the
rest
are
young
enough
to
make
mistakes
and
live
to
make
them
good
but
when
i
would
have
my
lesson
learned
my
strength
would
be
gone
it
half
gone
now
no
it
is
burst
out
the
youth
you
worth
half
a
dozen
of
those
young
ones
old
old
one
would
think
you
were
seventy
and
you
not
old
you
will
never
be
old
she
looked
up
where
a
crow
was
wheeling
in
the
air
if
she
said
slowly
following
its
motions
with
her
eyes
you
once
plant
your
feet
on
my
face
and
you
will
you
impish
bird
my
bernard
will
sing
a
different
song
no
bernard
wo
retorted
the
youth
bernard
knows
his
own
mind
even
if
he
is
a
boy
i
do
love
you
for
your
face
you
she
interrupted
him
with
a
shrug
and
a
bitter
sneer
evidently
who
would
a
look
of
mingled
pain
and
annoyance
overspread
his
features
how
you
twist
my
words
you
are
beautiful
to
me
and
you
know
what
i
meant
well
she
said
throwing
herself
backward
against
a
and
stretching
out
her
feet
on
the
grass
ripples
of
amusement
wavering
through
the
cloudy
expression
tell
me
what
do
you
love
in
me
he
was
silent
biting
his
lower
lip
i
tell
you
then
she
said
it
my
energy
the
life
in
me
that
is
youth
and
my
youth
has
overlived
its
time
i
had
a
long
lease
but
it
going
to
expire
soon
so
long
as
you
do
see
it
so
long
as
my
life
seems
fuller
than
yours
well
but
when
the
failure
of
life
becomes
visible
while
your
own
is
still
in
its
growth
you
will
turn
away
when
my
feet
wo
spring
any
more
yours
will
still
be
dancing
and
you
will
want
dancing
feet
with
you
i
will
not
he
answered
shortly
i
seen
plenty
of
other
women
i
saw
all
the
crowd
coming
up
this
morning
and
there
was
a
woman
there
to
compare
with
you
i
do
say
i
never
love
others
but
now
i
do
if
i
see
another
woman
like
you
but
i
never
could
love
one
of
those
young
girls
sh
sh
she
said
glancing
down
the
road
where
a
whirl
of
dust
was
making
towards
them
in
the
center
of
which
moved
a
band
of
bright
young
figures
there
they
come
now
do
they
look
beautiful
there
were
four
young
girls
in
front
their
faces
radiant
with
sun
and
air
and
daisy
wreaths
in
their
gleaming
hair
they
had
their
arms
around
each
other
waists
and
sang
as
they
walked
with
neither
more
accord
nor
discord
than
the
birds
about
them
the
voices
were
delicious
in
their
youth
and
joy
one
heard
that
they
were
singing
not
to
produce
a
musical
effect
but
from
the
mere
wish
to
sing
behind
them
came
a
troop
of
young
fellows
coats
off
heads
bare
racing
all
over
the
roadside
jostling
each
other
and
purposely
provoking
scrambles
the
tallest
one
had
a
nimbus
of
bright
curls
crowning
a
glowing
face
dimpled
and
sparkling
as
a
child
the
girls
glanced
shyly
at
him
under
their
lashes
as
he
danced
about
now
in
front
and
now
behind
them
occasionally
tossing
them
a
flower
but
mostly
hustling
his
comrades
about
behind
these
came
older
people
with
three
or
four
very
little
children
riding
on
their
backs
as
the
group
came
abreast
of
our
couple
they
stopped
to
exchange
a
few
words
then
went
on
when
they
had
passed
out
of
hearing
the
woman
sat
with
a
stare
in
her
eyes
looking
steadily
at
the
spot
where
the
bright
head
had
nodded
to
her
as
it
passed
like
a
wildflower
on
a
stalk
she
murmured
softly
narrowing
her
eyes
as
if
to
fix
the
vision
like
a
tall
her
companion
face
darkened
perceptibly
what
do
you
mean
what
do
you
see
he
asked
the
vision
of
youth
and
beauty
she
answered
in
the
tone
of
a
and
the
glory
and
triumph
of
it
the
immortality
of
it
its
splendid
indifference
to
its
ruined
temples
and
all
its
humble
worshipers
do
you
know
turning
suddenly
to
him
with
a
sharp
change
in
face
and
voice
what
i
would
be
wicked
enough
to
do
if
i
could
he
smiled
tolerantly
you
wicked
dear
one
you
could
be
wicked
oh
but
i
could
if
there
were
any
way
to
fix
davy
head
forever
just
as
he
passed
us
now
forever
so
that
all
the
world
might
keep
it
and
see
it
for
all
time
i
would
cut
it
off
with
this
hand
yes
i
would
her
eyes
glittered
mercilessly
he
shook
his
head
smiling
you
would
kill
a
bug
let
alone
davy
i
tell
you
i
would
do
you
remember
when
nathaniel
died
i
felt
bad
enough
but
do
you
know
the
week
before
when
he
was
so
very
sick
i
went
out
one
day
to
a
beautiful
glen
we
used
to
visit
together
they
had
been
improving
it
they
had
improved
it
so
much
that
the
water
is
all
dying
out
of
the
creek
the
little
boats
that
used
to
float
like
pond
lilies
lie
all
helpless
in
the
mud
and
hardly
a
ribbon
of
water
goes
over
the
fall
and
the
old
giant
trees
are
withering
oh
it
hurt
me
so
to
think
the
glory
of
a
thousand
years
was
vanishing
before
my
eyes
and
i
could
hold
it
and
suddenly
the
question
came
into
my
head
you
had
the
power
would
you
save
nathaniel
life
or
bring
back
the
water
to
the
glen
and
i
did
hesitate
a
minute
i
said
nathaniel
die
and
all
my
best
loved
ones
and
i
myself
but
bring
back
the
glory
of
the
glen
when
i
think
she
went
on
turning
away
and
becoming
dreamy
again
of
all
the
beauty
that
is
gone
that
i
can
never
see
that
is
lost
forever
the
beauty
that
had
to
alter
and
die
it
stifles
me
with
the
pain
of
it
why
must
it
all
die
he
looked
at
her
wonderingly
it
seems
to
me
he
said
slowly
that
beauty
worship
is
almost
a
disease
with
you
i
would
like
to
care
so
much
for
mere
outsides
we
never
long
for
the
thing
we
are
rich
in
she
answered
in
a
dry
changed
voice
nevertheless
his
face
lighted
it
was
pleasant
to
be
rich
in
the
thing
she
worshiped
he
had
gradually
drawn
near
her
feet
and
now
suddenly
bent
forward
and
kissed
them
passionately
do
she
cried
sharply
it
too
much
like
and
besides
his
face
was
white
and
quivering
his
voice
choked
well
what
besides
the
time
will
come
when
you
will
wish
you
had
reserved
that
kiss
for
some
other
foot
some
one
to
whom
it
will
all
be
new
who
will
shudder
with
the
joy
of
it
who
will
meet
you
half
way
who
will
believe
all
that
you
say
and
say
like
things
in
fullness
of
heart
and
i
perhaps
will
see
you
and
know
that
in
your
heart
you
are
sorry
you
gave
something
to
me
that
you
would
have
ungiven
if
you
could
he
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
you
do
not
love
me
at
all
he
said
you
do
not
believe
me
a
curious
softness
came
into
the
answer
oh
yes
dear
i
believe
you
years
ago
i
believed
myself
when
i
said
the
same
sort
of
thing
but
i
told
you
i
am
getting
old
i
can
not
unmake
what
the
years
have
made
nor
bring
back
what
they
have
stolen
i
love
you
your
the
words
had
a
sting
in
them
and
for
your
soul
too
and
i
am
glad
to
be
loved
by
you
but
do
you
know
what
i
am
thinking
he
did
not
answer
i
am
thinking
that
as
i
sit
here
beloved
by
you
and
others
who
are
young
and
beautiful
it
is
no
lie
in
a
well
in
a
triumph
i
have
not
sought
but
which
i
am
human
enough
to
be
glad
of
envied
no
doubt
by
those
young
girls
i
am
thinking
how
the
remorseless
feet
of
youth
will
tramp
on
me
soon
and
carry
you
away
and
very
slowly
in
my
day
of
pain
you
will
not
be
near
nor
the
others
i
shall
be
alone
age
and
pain
are
unlovely
you
wo
let
me
come
near
you
he
said
wildly
i
would
do
anything
for
you
i
always
want
to
do
things
for
you
to
spare
you
and
you
never
let
me
when
you
are
in
pain
you
will
push
me
away
a
fairly
exultant
glitter
flashed
in
her
face
yes
she
said
i
know
my
secret
that
is
how
i
have
stayed
young
so
long
see
she
said
stretching
out
her
arms
other
women
at
my
age
are
past
the
love
of
men
their
affections
have
gone
to
children
and
i
have
broken
the
law
of
nature
and
prolonged
the
love
of
youth
because
i
have
been
strong
and
stood
alone
but
there
is
an
end
things
change
seasons
change
you
i
all
change
what
the
use
of
saying
forever
forever
never
like
the
old
clock
on
the
stairs
it
a
big
lie
i
wo
talk
any
more
he
said
but
when
the
time
comes
you
will
see
she
nodded
yes
i
will
see
do
you
think
all
people
alike
as
like
as
ants
people
are
vessels
which
life
fills
and
breaks
as
it
does
trees
and
bees
and
other
sorts
of
vessels
they
play
when
they
are
little
and
then
they
love
and
then
they
have
children
and
then
they
die
ants
do
the
same
to
be
sure
but
i
do
deceive
myself
as
to
the
scope
of
it
the
crowd
were
returning
now
and
by
tacit
consent
they
arose
and
joined
the
group
down
the
road
they
jumped
a
fence
into
a
field
and
had
to
cross
a
little
stream
where
is
our
bridge
called
the
boys
we
made
a
bridge
some
one
has
stolen
our
bridge
oh
come
on
cried
davy
let
jump
it
three
ran
and
sprang
they
landed
laughing
and
taunting
the
rest
bernard
sought
out
his
beloved
shall
i
help
you
over
he
asked
no
she
said
shortly
help
the
girls
and
brushing
past
him
she
jumped
falling
a
little
short
and
muddying
a
foot
but
scrambling
up
unaided
the
rest
debated
seeking
an
advantageous
point
at
last
they
found
a
big
stone
in
the
middle
and
pulling
off
his
shoes
bernard
waded
in
the
creek
helping
the
girls
across
the
smallest
one
and
timid
clung
to
his
arm
and
let
him
almost
carry
her
over
he
does
it
real
natural
observed
davy
who
was
whisking
about
in
the
daisy
field
like
some
flashing
butterfly
they
gathered
daisies
and
laughed
and
sang
and
chattered
till
the
sun
went
low
then
they
gathered
under
a
big
tree
and
spread
their
lunch
on
the
ground
and
after
they
had
eaten
the
conversation
lay
between
the
woman
and
one
of
the
older
men
a
clever
conversation
filled
with
quaint
observations
and
curious
sidelights
the
boys
sat
all
about
the
woman
questioning
her
eagerly
but
behind
in
the
shadow
of
the
drooping
branches
sat
the
girls
silent
unobtrusive
holding
each
other
hands
now
and
then
the
talker
cast
a
furtive
glance
from
bernard
rather
withdrawn
face
to
the
faces
in
the
shadow
and
the
enigmatic
smile
hovered
and
flitted
over
her
lips
three
years
later
on
the
anniversary
of
that
summer
day
the
woman
sat
at
an
upstairs
window
in
the
house
on
the
little
farm
that
was
a
reality
now
the
little
farm
where
ten
free
men
and
women
labored
and
loved
she
had
come
with
the
others
and
done
her
best
but
the
cost
of
it
hard
labor
and
merciless
pain
was
stamped
on
the
face
that
looked
from
the
window
she
was
watching
bernard
figure
as
it
came
swinging
through
the
orchard
presently
he
came
in
and
up
the
stairs
his
feet
went
past
her
door
then
turned
back
irresolutely
and
a
low
knock
followed
her
eyebrows
bent
together
almost
sternly
as
she
answered
come
in
he
entered
with
a
smile
can
i
do
anything
for
you
this
morning
no
she
said
quietly
you
know
i
like
my
own
cranky
ways
i
rather
do
things
myself
he
nodded
i
know
i
always
get
the
same
answer
shall
you
go
to
the
picnic
you
surely
will
keep
our
picnic
perhaps
later
and
perhaps
not
there
was
a
curious
tone
of
repression
in
the
words
well
he
answered
if
you
wo
let
me
do
anything
for
you
i
have
to
find
some
one
who
will
is
bella
ready
to
go
this
half
hour
bella
here
is
bernard
and
bella
came
in
bella
the
timid
girl
with
the
brilliant
complexion
and
gazelle
soft
eyes
bella
radiant
in
her
youth
and
feminine
daintiness
more
lovely
than
she
had
been
three
years
before
she
gave
bernard
a
lunch
basket
to
carry
and
a
shawl
and
a
workbag
and
a
sun
umbrella
and
when
they
went
out
she
clung
to
his
arm
besides
she
stopped
near
one
of
their
own
rose
bushes
and
told
him
to
choose
a
bud
for
her
and
she
put
it
coquettishly
in
her
dark
hair
the
woman
watched
them
till
they
disappeared
down
the
lane
he
had
never
once
looked
back
then
her
mouth
settled
in
a
quiet
sneer
and
she
murmured
how
long
is
three
years
after
a
while
she
rose
and
crossed
to
an
old
mirror
that
hung
on
the
opposite
wall
staring
at
the
reflection
it
gave
back
she
whispered
drearily
you
are
ugly
you
are
eaten
with
pain
do
you
still
expect
the
due
of
youth
and
beauty
did
you
not
know
it
all
long
ago
then
something
flashed
in
the
image
something
as
if
the
features
had
caught
fire
and
burned
i
will
not
she
said
hoarsely
her
fingers
clenching
i
will
not
surrender
was
it
he
i
loved
it
was
his
youth
his
beauty
his
life
and
younger
youth
shall
love
me
still
stronger
life
i
will
not
i
will
not
die
alive
she
turned
away
and
ran
down
into
the
yard
and
out
into
the
fields
she
would
not
go
on
the
common
highway
where
all
went
she
would
find
a
hard
way
through
woods
and
over
hills
and
she
would
come
there
before
them
and
sit
and
wait
for
them
where
the
ways
met
bareheaded
and
careless
she
ran
along
finding
a
fierce
pleasure
in
trampling
and
breaking
the
brush
that
impeded
her
there
was
the
road
at
last
and
right
ahead
of
her
an
old
old
man
hobbling
along
with
bent
back
and
eyes
upon
the
ground
just
before
him
was
a
bad
hole
in
the
road
he
stopped
irresolute
and
looked
around
like
a
crippled
insect
stretching
its
antenna
to
find
a
way
for
its
mangled
feet
she
called
cheerily
let
me
help
you
he
looked
up
with
dim
blue
eyes
helplessly
seeking
she
led
him
slowly
around
the
dangerous
place
and
then
they
sat
down
together
on
the
little
covered
wooden
bridge
beyond
ah
murmured
the
old
man
shaking
his
head
it
is
good
to
be
young
and
there
was
the
ghost
of
admiration
in
his
watery
eyes
as
he
looked
at
her
tall
straight
figure
yes
she
answered
sadly
looking
away
down
the
road
where
she
saw
bella
white
dress
fluttering
it
is
good
to
be
young
the
lovers
passed
without
noticing
them
absorbed
in
each
other
presently
the
old
man
hobbled
away
it
will
come
to
that
too
she
muttered
looking
after
him
the
husks
of
life
the
old
shoemaker
he
had
lived
a
long
time
there
in
the
house
at
the
end
of
the
alley
and
no
one
had
ever
known
that
he
was
a
great
man
he
was
lean
and
palsied
and
had
a
crooked
back
his
beard
was
grey
and
ragged
and
his
eyebrows
came
too
far
forward
there
were
seams
and
flaps
in
the
empty
yellow
old
skin
and
he
gasped
horribly
when
he
breathed
taking
hold
of
the
lintel
of
the
door
to
steady
himself
when
he
stepped
out
on
the
broken
bricks
of
the
alley
he
lived
with
a
frightful
old
woman
who
scrubbed
the
floors
of
the
and
drank
beer
and
growled
at
the
children
who
poked
fun
at
her
he
had
lived
with
her
eighteen
years
she
said
stroking
the
furry
little
kitten
that
curled
up
in
her
neck
as
if
she
had
been
beautiful
eighteen
years
they
had
been
drinking
and
quarreling
together
and
suffering
she
had
seen
the
flesh
sucking
away
from
the
bones
and
the
skin
falling
in
upon
them
and
the
long
lean
fingers
growing
more
lean
and
trembling
as
they
crooked
round
his
shoemaking
tools
it
was
very
strange
she
had
not
grown
thin
the
beer
had
bloated
her
and
rolls
of
weak
shaking
flesh
lapped
over
the
ridges
of
her
uncouth
figure
her
pale
blue
eyes
wandered
aimlessly
about
as
she
talked
no
he
had
never
told
her
not
even
in
their
quarrels
not
even
when
they
were
drunken
together
of
the
great
visitor
who
had
come
up
the
little
alley
yesterday
walking
so
stately
over
the
bricks
taking
no
note
of
the
others
and
coming
in
at
the
door
without
asking
she
had
not
expected
such
an
one
how
could
she
but
the
old
shoemaker
had
shown
no
surprise
at
the
mighty
one
he
smiled
and
set
down
the
teacup
he
was
holding
and
entered
into
communion
with
the
stranger
he
noticed
no
others
but
continued
to
smile
and
the
infinite
dignity
of
the
unknown
fell
upon
him
and
covered
the
wasted
old
limbs
and
the
hard
wizened
face
so
that
all
we
who
entered
bowed
and
went
out
and
did
not
speak
but
we
understood
for
the
mighty
one
gave
understanding
without
words
we
had
been
in
the
presence
of
freedom
we
had
stood
at
the
foot
of
tabor
and
seen
this
worn
old
soul
lose
all
its
dross
and
commonplace
and
pass
upward
smiling
to
the
transfiguration
in
the
hands
of
the
mighty
one
the
crust
had
crumbled
and
dropped
away
in
impalpable
powder
souls
should
be
mixed
of
it
no
more
only
that
which
passed
upward
the
fine
white
playing
flame
the
heart
of
the
long
watches
of
patience
should
rekindle
there
in
the
perennial
ascension
of
the
great
soul
of
man
where
the
white
rose
died
it
was
late
at
night
a
raw
night
that
shoved
men
in
corners
as
having
no
business
in
the
street
and
the
few
people
in
the
northbound
car
drew
themselves
into
themselves
radiating
hedgehog
quills
of
feeling
at
their
neighbors
presently
there
came
in
a
curious
figure
clothed
in
the
drapery
of
its
country
honor
the
blue
flannel
flapping
very
much
about
its
legs
i
looked
at
its
feet
first
because
they
were
so
very
small
and
girlish
and
because
the
owner
of
them
adjusted
the
flapping
pants
with
the
coquetry
of
a
maiden
switching
her
skirts
then
i
glanced
at
the
hands
they
also
were
small
and
womanish
and
constantly
in
motion
at
last
the
face
expecting
a
fresh
young
boy
not
long
away
from
some
country
village
it
was
the
sunk
seamed
face
of
a
man
of
seared
and
with
eyebrows
but
lit
by
twinkling
young
eyes
that
gleamed
at
everything
the
sailor
pancake
with
its
official
lettering
was
pushed
rakishly
down
and
forward
and
looking
at
hat
and
wearer
one
instinctively
turned
milliner
and
decorated
the
shape
with
aigrette
and
bows
they
would
nod
so
accordant
with
the
flirting
head
presently
the
restless
hands
went
up
and
gave
the
hat
another
tilt
went
down
and
straightened
the
divided
skirt
folded
themselves
an
instant
while
the
little
feet
began
tattooing
the
car
floor
and
the
scintillant
eyes
looked
general
invitation
all
round
the
car
no
perceptible
shrinkage
of
quills
however
so
the
eyes
wandered
over
to
their
image
in
the
plate
glass
and
directly
the
hat
got
another
coquettish
dip
and
the
skirts
another
flirt
and
settle
the
conductor
came
in
some
one
to
talk
to
at
last
will
you
let
me
off
at
ninth
and
race
the
dim
chill
of
a
smile
shivered
over
the
other
faces
in
the
car
ninth
and
race
who
ever
heard
a
defender
of
his
country
glory
ask
a
conductor
on
a
street
car
in
philadelphia
for
any
other
point
than
ninth
and
race
the
conductor
nodded
appreciatively
just
come
to
the
city
i
suppose
he
said
interlocutively
the
sailor
plucked
off
his
hat
exhibiting
his
label
with
vanity
alabama
here
for
three
days
just
been
over
in
new
york
like
it
remarked
the
conductor
prolonging
his
stay
inside
the
car
the
hat
went
on
again
proudly
sixteen
years
in
the
service
yes
sir
years
the
service
is
all
right
the
service
is
good
enough
for
me
live
there
expect
to
die
there
sixteen
years
you
wo
forget
to
let
me
off
at
ninth
and
race
no
going
to
see
chinatown
sure
chinatown
all
right
seen
it
in
hong
kong
want
to
see
it
in
philadelphia
o
cradle
of
my
country
freedom
these
are
your
defenders
these
to
whom
your
chief
delight
is
your
stews
and
your
brothels
your
fantans
and
your
opium
dens
your
sinks
of
filth
and
your
cesspools
of
slime
let
them
only
be
as
they
were
at
hong
kong
or
worse
and
the
service
asks
no
more
he
will
live
in
it
and
die
in
it
and
it
good
enough
for
him
oh
not
your
patriotic
legends
nor
the
halls
of
the
great
rebel
birth
nor
the
solemn
silent
bell
that
once
proclaimed
liberty
throughout
the
land
nor
the
piteous
relics
of
your
dead
wise
men
nor
any
dream
of
your
bright
pure
young
days
when
yet
you
were
a
fair
greene
country
towne
swims
up
in
the
vision
of
the
service
when
he
sets
his
foot
within
your
borders
filling
him
with
devotion
to
our
lady
liberty
and
drawing
him
to
new
world
pilgrim
shrines
not
these
oh
no
not
these
but
your
leper
spot
your
old
world
your
of
human
vermin
so
there
is
chinatown
and
electric
glare
enough
upon
it
and
enough
within
it
the
service
is
good
enough
for
him
he
will
shoot
to
order
in
your
defense
till
he
dies
went
the
little
feet
upon
the
floor
and
the
pancake
got
another
rakish
pull
presently
the
active
figure
squared
sharply
about
and
faced
the
door
the
car
had
stopped
and
a
drunken
man
was
staggering
in
the
sailor
caught
him
in
his
arms
swung
him
about
and
seated
him
beside
himself
with
a
comforting
now
all
right
sir
sit
right
here
my
friend
the
drunkard
had
a
sodden
stupid
face
and
bleary
eyes
from
which
the
alcohol
was
oozing
in
his
shaking
hand
he
held
a
bunch
of
delicate
roses
hothouse
roses
cream
and
pink
the
odor
of
them
drifted
faintly
through
the
car
like
a
whiff
of
summer
something
like
a
sigh
of
relaxation
exhaled
from
the
and
a
dozen
commiserating
eyes
were
fastened
on
the
flowers
so
fragile
so
sweet
so
inoffensive
so
wantonly
sacrificed
the
hot
unsteady
clutching
hand
had
already
burned
the
stems
and
the
pale
helpless
faces
of
the
roses
drooped
heavily
the
drunkard
full
of
beery
effervescence
cast
a
bubbling
look
over
the
car
and
spying
a
young
lady
opposite
suddenly
stood
up
and
offered
the
bouquet
to
her
she
stared
resolutely
through
him
seeing
and
hearing
nothing
not
even
the
piteous
with
their
pleading
downbent
heads
and
with
a
confused
muttering
of
no
offense
no
offense
you
know
the
man
sank
back
again
as
he
did
so
the
uncertain
fingers
released
one
stem
and
a
bloom
went
fluttering
down
like
a
butterfly
with
broken
wings
there
it
lay
jolting
back
and
forth
on
the
dirty
floor
and
no
one
dared
to
pick
it
up
presently
the
drunkard
sopped
over
comfortably
on
the
sailor
shoulder
who
with
a
generally
directed
wink
of
bonhomie
settled
him
easily
bestowing
a
sympathetic
pat
upon
the
bloated
cheek
the
conductor
disturbed
the
situation
by
asking
for
his
fare
the
drunkard
stupidly
rubbed
his
eyes
and
offered
his
flowers
in
place
of
the
nickel
again
they
were
refused
and
after
a
fluctuant
search
in
his
pockets
between
intervals
of
nodding
the
dirty
bit
of
metal
was
produced
accepted
and
still
the
dying
blossoms
shivered
in
the
torturer
hands
he
was
drowsing
off
again
when
by
some
sudden
turn
of
the
obstructed
machinery
in
his
skull
his
lids
opened
and
he
struggled
up
the
image
of
myself
must
have
swum
suddenly
across
the
momentarily
acting
and
with
gurgling
deference
at
the
immanent
risk
of
losing
his
equilibrium
once
more
he
proffered
the
bouquet
to
me
grabbing
the
heads
and
presenting
them
towards
a
smothered
snuffle
went
round
the
car
i
wanted
them
oh
how
i
wanted
them
my
heart
beat
suffocatingly
with
the
sense
of
baffled
pity
and
rage
and
cowardice
who
was
he
that
drunken
sot
with
his
smirching
wabbling
hand
that
i
should
fear
to
take
the
roses
from
him
why
must
i
grind
my
teeth
and
sit
there
helpless
while
those
beautiful
things
were
crushed
and
blasted
and
torn
in
living
fragments
i
could
take
them
home
i
could
give
them
drink
they
would
lift
up
their
heads
they
would
open
wide
for
days
they
would
make
the
room
sweet
and
the
pale
soft
glory
of
their
inimitable
petals
would
shine
like
a
luminous
promise
across
the
winter
nobody
wanted
them
nobody
cared
this
sodden
beast
in
the
of
his
consciousness
wished
to
be
quit
of
them
might
i
not
take
them
something
sharp
bit
and
burned
my
eyelids
as
i
glanced
at
the
one
on
the
floor
the
conductor
had
stepped
on
it
and
crushed
it
open
and
there
lay
the
marvelous
creamy
leaves
curled
at
their
edges
like
lips
each
with
its
glory
greater
than
solomon
all
fouled
and
ruined
in
the
human
reek
and
i
dared
not
save
the
others
miserable
coward
i
forced
my
hands
tighter
in
my
pockets
and
turned
my
head
away
towards
the
outside
night
and
the
backward
slipping
street
between
me
and
it
a
dim
reflection
wavered
the
image
of
the
thing
that
stood
there
before
me
and
somewhere
like
a
dulled
bell
i
heard
the
words
and
god
created
man
in
his
own
image
in
the
image
of
god
created
he

the
sailor
no
doubt
with
the
kindly
intention
of
relieving
me
from
annoyance
and
not
averse
to
play
with
anything
made
pretence
of
seizing
the
roses
then
the
drunkard
in
an
abandon
of
generosity
began
tearing
off
the
blossoms
by
the
heads
scrutinizing
and
casting
each
away
as
unfit
for
the
exalted
service
of
his
friend
till
the
latter
reaching
out
managed
to
get
hold
of
a
white
one
with
a
stem
he
trimmed
its
sheltering
green
carefully
brought
out
a
long
black
pin
stuck
it
through
the
stalk
and
fastened
the
pale
shining
head
against
his
dark
blue
blouse

hedgehoggery

with
