introduction
rooms
may
be
decorated
in
two
ways
by
a
superficial
application
of
ornament
totally
independent
of
structure
or
by
means
of
those
architectural
features
which
are
part
of
the
organism
of
every
house
inside
as
well
as
out
in
the
middle
ages
when
warfare
and
brigandage
shaped
the
conditions
of
life
and
men
camped
in
their
castles
much
as
they
did
in
their
tents
it
was
natural
that
decorations
should
be
portable
and
that
the
naked
walls
of
the
mediæval
chamber
should
be
hung
with
arras
while
a
or
ceiling
of
cloth
stretched
across
the
open
timbers
of
its
roof
when
life
became
more
secure
and
when
the
italian
conquests
of
the
valois
had
acquainted
men
north
of
the
alps
with
the
spirit
of
classic
tradition
proportion
and
the
relation
of
voids
to
masses
gradually
came
to
be
regarded
as
the
chief
decorative
values
of
the
interior
portable
hangings
were
in
consequence
replaced
by
architectural
ornament
in
other
words
the
architecture
of
the
room
became
its
decoration
this
architectural
treatment
held
its
own
through
every
change
of
taste
until
the
second
quarter
of
the
present
century
but
since
then
various
influences
have
combined
to
sever
the
natural
connection
between
the
outside
of
the
modern
house
and
its
interior
in
the
average
house
the
architect
task
seems
virtually
confined
to
the
elevations
and
the
designing
of
what
are
regarded
as
insignificant
details
such
as
mouldings
architraves
and
cornices
has
become
a
perfunctory
work
hurried
over
and
unregarded
and
when
this
work
is
done
the
upholsterer
is
called
in
to
decorate
and
furnish
the
rooms
as
the
result
of
this
division
of
labor
has
ceased
to
be
a
branch
of
architecture
the
upholsterer
can
not
be
expected
to
have
the
preliminary
training
necessary
for
architectural
work
and
it
is
inevitable
that
in
his
hands
form
should
be
sacrificed
to
color
and
composition
to
detail
in
his
ignorance
of
the
legitimate
means
of
producing
certain
effects
he
is
driven
to
all
manner
of
expedients
the
result
of
which
is
a
piling
up
of
heterogeneous
ornament
a
multiplication
of
incongruous
effects
and
lacking
as
he
does
a
definite
first
conception
his
work
becomes
so
involved
that
it
seems
impossible
for
him
to
make
an
end
the
confusion
resulting
from
these
unscientific
methods
has
reflected
itself
in
the
lay
mind
and
has
come
to
be
regarded
as
a
black
art
by
those
who
have
seen
their
rooms
subjected
to
the
manipulations
of
the
modern
upholsterer
now
in
the
hands
of
decorators
who
understand
the
fundamental
principles
of
their
art
the
surest
effects
are
produced
not
at
the
expense
of
simplicity
and
common
sense
but
by
observing
the
requirements
of
both
these
requirements
are
identical
with
those
regulating
domestic
architecture
the
chief
end
in
both
cases
being
the
suitable
accommodation
of
the
inmates
of
the
house
the
fact
that
this
end
has
in
a
measure
been
lost
sight
of
is
perhaps
sufficient
warrant
for
the
publication
of
this
elementary
sketch
no
study
of
as
a
branch
of
has
for
at
least
fifty
years
been
published
in
england
or
america
and
though
france
is
always
producing
admirable
monographs
on
isolated
branches
of
this
subject
there
is
no
modern
french
work
corresponding
with
such
comprehensive
manuals
as
or
isaac
ware
body
of
the
attempt
to
remedy
this
deficiency
in
some
slight
degree
has
made
it
necessary
to
dwell
at
length
upon
the
strictly
architectural
principles
which
controlled
the
work
of
the
old
decorators
the
effects
that
they
aimed
at
having
been
based
mainly
on
the
due
adjustment
of
parts
it
has
been
impossible
to
explain
their
methods
without
assuming
their
standpoint
that
of
in
contradistinction
to
the
modern
view
of
as
application
of
when
was
a
part
of
architecture
all
its
values
were
founded
on
structural
modifications
consequently
it
may
seem
that
ideas
to
be
derived
from
a
study
of
such
methods
suggest
changes
too
radical
for
those
who
are
not
building
but
are
merely
decorating
such
changes
in
fact
lie
rather
in
the
direction
of
alteration
than
of
adornment
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
results
attained
will
be
of
greater
decorative
value
than
were
an
equal
expenditure
devoted
to
moreover
the
great
decorators
if
scrupulous
in
the
observance
of
architectural
principles
were
ever
governed
in
the
use
of
ornamental
detail
by
the
greek
sôphrosynê
the
wise
moderation
of
the
greeks
and
the
rooms
of
the
past
were
both
simpler
in
treatment
and
freer
from
mere
embellishments
than
those
of
besides
if
it
be
granted
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
a
reform
in
if
not
necessary
is
at
least
desirable
it
must
be
admitted
that
such
reform
can
originate
only
with
those
whose
means
permit
of
any
experiments
which
their
taste
may
suggest
when
the
rich
man
demands
good
architecture
his
neighbors
will
get
it
too
the
vulgarity
of
current
decoration
has
its
source
in
the
indifference
of
the
wealthy
to
architectural
fitness
every
good
moulding
every
carefully
studied
detail
exacted
by
those
who
can
afford
to
indulge
their
taste
will
in
time
find
its
way
to
the
cottage
once
the
right
precedent
is
established
it
costs
less
to
follow
than
to
oppose
it
in
conclusion
it
may
be
well
to
explain
the
seeming
lack
of
accord
between
the
arguments
used
in
this
book
and
the
illustrations
chosen
to
interpret
them
while
much
is
said
of
simplicity
the
illustrations
used
are
chiefly
taken
from
houses
of
some
importance
this
has
been
done
in
order
that
only
such
apartments
as
are
accessible
to
the
traveller
might
be
given
as
examples
unprofessional
readers
will
probably
be
more
interested
in
studying
rooms
that
they
have
seen
or
at
least
heard
of
than
those
in
the
ordinary
private
dwelling
and
the
arguments
advanced
are
indirectly
sustained
by
the
most
ornate
rooms
here
shown
since
their
effect
is
based
on
such
harmony
of
line
that
their
superficial
ornament
might
be
removed
without
loss
to
the
composition
moreover
as
some
of
the
illustrations
prove
the
most
magnificent
palaces
of
europe
contain
rooms
as
simple
as
those
in
any
private
house
and
to
point
out
that
simplicity
is
at
home
even
in
palaces
is
perhaps
not
the
least
service
that
may
be
rendered
to
the
modern
decorator
illustration
italian

of

florence
i
the
historical
tradition
the
last
ten
years
have
been
marked
by
a
notable
development
in
architecture
and
decoration
and
while
france
will
long
retain
her
present
superiority
in
these
arts
our
own
advance
is
perhaps
more
significant
than
that
of
any
other
country
when
we
measure
the
work
recently
done
in
the
united
states
by
the
accepted
architectural
standards
of
ten
years
ago
the
change
is
certainly
striking
especially
in
view
of
the
fact
that
our
local
architects
and
decorators
are
without
the
countless
advantages
in
the
way
of
schools
museums
and
libraries
which
are
at
the
command
of
their
european
colleagues
in
paris
for
instance
it
is
impossible
to
take
even
a
short
walk
without
finding
inspiration
in
those
admirable
buildings
public
and
private
religious
and
secular
that
bear
the
stamp
of
the
most
refined
taste
the
world
has
known
since
the
decline
of
the
arts
in
italy
and
probably
all
american
architects
will
acknowledge
that
no
amount
of
travel
abroad
and
study
at
home
can
compensate
for
the
lack
of
daily
familiarity
with
such
monuments
it
is
therefore
all
the
more
encouraging
to
note
the
steady
advance
in
taste
and
knowledge
to
which
the
most
recent
architecture
in
america
bears
witness
this
advance
is
chiefly
due
to
the
fact
that
american
architects
are
beginning
to
perceive
two
things
that
their
french
colleagues
among
all
the
modern
vagaries
of
taste
have
never
quite
lost
sight
of
first
that
architecture
and
decoration
having
wandered
since
in
a
labyrinth
of
dubious
eclecticism
can
be
set
right
only
by
a
close
study
of
the
best
models
and
secondly
that
given
the
requirements
of
modern
life
these
models
are
chiefly
to
be
found
in
buildings
erected
in
italy
after
the
beginning
of
the
sixteenth
century
and
in
other
european
countries
after
the
full
assimilation
of
the
italian
influence
as
the
latter
of
these
propositions
may
perhaps
be
questioned
by
those
who
in
admiring
the
earlier
styles
sometimes
lose
sight
of
their
relative
unfitness
for
modern
use
it
must
be
understood
at
the
outset
that
it
implies
no
disregard
for
the
inherent
beauties
of
these
styles
it
would
be
difficult
assuredly
to
find
buildings
better
suited
to
their
original
purpose
than
some
of
the
great
feudal
castles
such
as
warwick
in
england
or
langeais
in
france
and
as
much
might
be
said
of
the
grim
machicolated
palaces
of
republican
florence
or
siena
but
our
whole
mode
of
life
has
so
entirely
changed
since
the
days
in
which
these
buildings
were
erected
that
they
no
longer
answer
to
our
needs
it
is
only
necessary
to
picture
the
lives
led
in
those
days
to
see
how
far
removed
from
them
our
present
social
conditions
are
inside
and
outside
the
house
all
told
of
the
unsettled
condition
of
country
or
town
the
danger
of
armed
attack
the
clumsy
means
of
defence
the
insecurity
of
property
the
few
opportunities
of
social
intercourse
as
we
understand
it
a
man
house
was
in
very
truth
his
castle
in
the
middle
ages
and
in
france
and
england
especially
it
remained
so
until
the
end
of
the
sixteenth
century
thus
it
was
that
many
needs
arose
the
tall
keep
of
masonry
where
the
inmates
pent
up
against
attack
awaited
the
signal
of
the
watchman
who
from
his
platform
or
gave
warning

narrowed

the

to
bend
his

not
as
ruskin
would
have
us
believe
because
irregularity
was
thought
artistic
but
because
the
mediæval
architect
trained
to
the
uses
of
necessity
knew
that
he
must
design
openings
that
should
afford
no
passage
to
the
arrows
no
clue
to
what
was
going
on
inside
the
keep
but
to
the
reader
familiar
with
or
with
any
of
the
many
excellent
works
on
english
domestic
architecture
further
details
will
seem
superfluous
it
is
necessary
however
to
point
out
that
long
after
the
conditions
of
life
in
europe
had
changed
houses
retained
many
features
of
the
feudal
period
the
survival
of
obsolete
customs
which
makes
the
study
of
sociology
so
interesting
has
its
parallel
in
the
history
of
architecture
in
the
feudal
countries
especially
where
the
conflict
between
the
great
nobles
and
the
king
was
of
such
long
duration
that
civilization
spread
very
slowly
architecture
was
proportionately
slow
to
give
up
many
of
its
feudal
characteristics
in
italy
on
the
contrary
where
one
city
after
another
succumbed
to
some
accomplished
condottiere
who
between
his
campaigns
read
virgil
and
collected
antique
marbles
the
rugged
little
republics
were
soon
converted
into
brilliant
courts
where
life
being
relatively
secure
social
intercourse
rapidly
developed
this
change
of
conditions
brought
with
it
the
paved
street
and
square
the
palaces
with
their
great
and
stately
open
staircases
and
the
with
its
loggia
adorned
with
statues
and
marble
seats
italy
in
short
returned
instinctively
to
the
roman
ideal
of
civic
life
the
life
of
the
street
the
forum
and
the
baths
these
very
conditions
though
approaching
so
much
nearer
than
feudalism
to
our
modern
civilization
in
some
respects
make
the
italian
architecture
of
the
renaissance
less
serviceable
as
a
model
than
the
french
and
english
styles
later
developed
from
it
the
very
dangers
and
barbarities
of
feudalism
had
fostered
and
preserved
the
idea
of
home
as
of
something
private
shut
off
from
intrusion
and
while
the
roman
ideal
flowered
in
the
great
palace
with
its
galleries
loggias
and
saloons
itself
a
kind
of
forum
the
french
or
english
feudal
keep
became
by
the
same
process
of
growth
the
modern
private
house
the
domestic
architecture
of
the
renaissance
in
italy
offers
but
two
distinctively
characteristic
styles
of
building
the
palace
and
the
villa
or
there
is
nothing
corresponding
in
interior
arrangements
with
the
french
or
english
town
house
or
the
where
the
provincial
nobles
lived
all
the
year
round
the
villa
was
a
mere
perch
used
for
a
few
weeks
of
gaiety
in
spring
or
autumn
it
was
never
a
home
as
the
french
or
english
was
there
were
of
course
private
houses
in
renaissance
italy
but
these
were
occupied
rather
by
shopkeepers
craftsmen
and
the
than
by
the
class
which
in
france
and
england
lived
in
country
houses
or
small
private
hôtels
the
elevations
of
these
small
italian
houses
are
often
admirable
examples
of
domestic
architecture
but
their
planning
is
rudimentary
and
it
may
be
said
that
the
characteristic
tendencies
of
modern
were
developed
rather
in
the
mezzanin
or
intermediate
story
of
the
italian
renaissance
palace
than
in
the
small
house
of
the
same
period
it
is
a
fact
recognized
by
political
economists
that
changes
in
manners
and
customs
no
matter
under
what
form
of
government
usually
originate
with
the
wealthy
or
aristocratic
minority
and
are
thence
transmitted
to
the
other
classes
thus
the
of
one
generation
lives
more
like
the
aristocrat
of
a
previous
generation
than
like
his
own
predecessors
this
rule
naturally
holds
good
of
and
it
is
for
this
reason
that
the
origin
of
modern
should
be
sought
rather
in
the
prince
mezzanin
than
in
the
small
dwelling
the
italian
mezzanin
probably
originated
in
the
habit
of
building
certain
very
saloons
and
of
lowering
the
ceiling
of
the
adjoining
rooms
this
created
an
intermediate
story
or
rather
scattered
intermediate
rooms
which
bramante
was
among
the
first
to
use
in
the
planning
of
his
palaces
but
bramante
did
not
reveal
the
existence
of
the
mezzanin
in
his
façades
and
it
was
not
until
the
time
of
peruzzi
and
his
contemporaries
that
it
became
both
in
plan
and
elevation
an
accepted
part
of
the
italian
palace
it
is
for
this
reason
that
the
year
is
a
convenient
point
from
which
to
date
the
beginning
of
modern
but
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
this
date
is
purely
arbitrary
and
represents
merely
an
imaginary
line
drawn
between
mediæval
and
modern
ways
of
living
and
as
exemplified
respectively
for
instance
in
the
ducal
palace
of
urbino
built
by
luciano
da
laurano
about
and
the
palace
of
the
massimi
alle
colonne
in
rome
built
by
baldassare
peruzzi
during
the
first
half
of
the
sixteenth
century
the
lives
of
the
great
italian
nobles
were
essentially
lives
all
was
organized
with
a
view
to
public
pageants
ceremonies
and
entertainments
domestic
life
was
subordinated
to
this
spectacular
existence
and
instead
of
building
private
houses
in
our
sense
they
built
palaces
of
which
they
set
aside
a
portion
for
the
use
of
the
family
every
italian
palace
has
its
mezzanin
or
private
apartment
but
this
part
of
the
building
is
now
seldom
seen
by
travellers
in
italy
not
only
is
it
usually
inhabited
by
the
owners
of
the
palace
but
its
decorations
being
simpler
than
those
of
the
or
principal
story
it
is
not
thought
worthy
of
inspection
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
treatment
of
the
mezzanin
was
generally
most
beautiful
because
most
suitable
and
while
the
italian
renaissance
palace
can
seldom
serve
as
a
model
for
a
modern
private
house
the
decoration
of
the
mezzanin
rooms
is
full
of
appropriate
suggestion
in
france
and
england
on
the
other
hand
private
life
was
gradually
though
slowly
developing
along
the
lines
it
still
follows
in
the
present
day
it
is
necessary
to
bear
in
mind
that
what
we
call
modern
civilization
was
a
later
growth
in
these
two
countries
than
in
italy
if
this
fact
is
insisted
upon
it
is
only
because
it
explains
the
relative
unsuitability
of
french
renaissance
or
tudor
and
elizabethan
architecture
to
modern
life
in
france
for
instance
it
was
not
until
the
fronde
was
subdued
and
louis
xiv
firmly
established
on
the
throne
that
the
elements
which
compose
what
we
call
modern
life
really
began
to
combine
in
fact
it
might
be
said
that
the
feudalism
of
which
the
fronde
was
the
lingering
expression
had
its
counterpart
in
the
architecture
of
the
period
while
long
familiarity
with
italy
was
beginning
to
tell
upon
the
practical
side
of
many
obsolete
details
were
still
preserved
even
the
most
enthusiastic
admirer
of
the
french
renaissance
would
hardly
maintain
that
the
houses
of
that
period
are
what
we
should
call
in
the
modern
sense
convenient
it
would
be
impossible
for
a
modern
family
to
occupy
with
any
degree
of
comfort
the
hôtel
voguë
at
dijon
one
of
the
best
examples
as
originally
planned
of
domestic
architecture
in
france
the
same
objection
applies
to
the
furniture
of
the
period
this
arose
from
the
fact
that
owing
to
the
unsettled
state
of
the
country
the
landed
proprietor
always
carried
his
furniture
with
him
when
he
travelled
from
one
estate
to
another
furniture
in
the
vocabulary
of
the
middle
ages
meant
something
which
may
be
transported
meubles
sont
apelez
peut
transporter
hence
the
lack
of
variety
in
furniture
before
the
seventeenth
century
and
also
its
unsuitableness
to
modern
life
chairs
and
cabinets
that
had
to
be
carried
about
on
were
necessarily
somewhat
stiff
and
angular
in
design
it
is
perhaps
not
too
much
to
say
that
a
comfortable
chair
in
our
modern
sense
did
not
exist
before
the
louis
xiv
see
plate
iv
and
the
cushioned
the
ancestor
of
our
upholstered
can
not
be
traced
back
further
than
the
regency
prior
to
the
time
of
louis
xiv
the
most
luxurious
people
had
to
content
themselves
with
hard
seats
the
necessities
of
transportation
permitted
little
variety
of
design
and
every
piece
of
furniture
was
constructed
with
the
double
purpose
of
being
easily
carried
about
and
of
being
used
as
a
trunk
see
plate
i
as
havard
says
tout
meuble
se
traduisait
par
un
coffre
the
unvarying
design
of
the
cabinets
is
explained
by
the
fact
that
they
were
made
to
form
two
trunks
and
even
the
chairs
and
settles
had
hollow
seats
which
could
be
packed
with

see
plate
ii
the
king
himself
when
he
went
from
one
château
to
another
carried
all
his
furniture
with
him
and
it
is
thus
not
surprising
that
lesser
people
contented
themselves
with
a
few
substantial
chairs
and
cabinets
and
enough
arras
or
cloth
of
douai
to
cover
the
draughty
walls
of
their
one

an
amusing
instance
of
the
scarceness
of
furniture

time

describing
a
fire
in

says
that

or

of
the
persons
from

were
brought
to
her
for
shelter

was
known

fully
established

of
the
modifications

the

architecture
having
followed
a
line
of
development
so
similar
that
it
need
not
here
be
traced
it
remains
only
to
examine
in
detail
the
opening
proposition
namely
that
modern
architecture
and
decoration
having
in
many
ways
deviated
from
the
paths
which
the
experience
of
the
past
had
marked
out
for
them
can
be
reclaimed
only
by
a
study
of
the
best
models
it
might
of
course
be
said
that
to
attain
this
end
originality
is
more
necessary
than
imitativeness
to
this
it
may
be
replied
that
no
lost
art
can
be
without
at
least
for
a
time
going
back
to
the
methods
and
manner
of
those
who
formerly
practised
it
or
the
objection
may
be
met
by
the
question
what
is
originality
in
art
perhaps
it
is
easier
to
define
what
it
is
and
this
may
be
done
by
saying
that
it
is
never
a
wilful
rejection
of
what
have
been
accepted
as
the
necessary
laws
of
the
various
forms
of
art
thus
in
reasoning
originality
lies
not
in
discarding
the
necessary
laws
of
thought
but
in
using
them
to
express
new
intellectual
conceptions
in
poetry
originality
consists
not
in
discarding
the
necessary
laws
of
rhythm
but
in
finding
new
rhythms
within
the
limits
of
those
laws
most
of
the
features
of
architecture
that
have
persisted
through
various
fluctuations
of
taste
owe
their
preservation
to
the
fact
that
they
have
been
proved
by
experience
to
be
necessary
and
it
will
be
found
that
none
of
them
precludes
the
exercise
of
individual
taste
any
more
than
the
acceptance
of
the
syllogism
or
of
the
laws
of
rhythm
prevents
new
thinkers
and
new
poets
from
saying
what
has
never
been
said
before
once
this
is
clearly
understood
it
will
be
seen
that
the
supposed
conflict
between
originality
and
tradition
is
no
conflict
at
all
in
citing
logic
and
poetry
those
arts
have
been
purposely
chosen
of
which
the
laws
will
perhaps
best
help
to
explain
and
illustrate
the
character
of
architectural
limitations
a
building
for
whatever
purpose
erected
must
be
built
in
strict
accordance
with
the
requirements
of
that
purpose
in
other
words
it
must
have
a
reason
for
being
as
it
is
and
must
be
as
it
is
for
that
reason
its
decoration
must
harmonize
with
the
structural
limitations
which
is
by
no
means
the
same
thing
as
saying
that
all
decoration
must
be
structural
and
from
this
harmony
of
the
general
scheme
of
decoration
with
the
building
and
of
the
details
of
the
decoration
with
each
other
springs
the
rhythm
that
distinguishes
architecture
from
mere
construction

all
good
architecture

it

many
of
the
most
popular
features
in
modern
and
decoration
will
not
be
found
to
stand
this
double
test
often
as
will
be
shown
further
on
they
are
merely
survivals
of
earlier
social
conditions
and
have
been
preserved
in
obedience
to
that
instinct
that
makes
people
cling
to
so
many
customs
the
meaning
of
which
is
lost
in
other
cases
they
have
been
revived
by
the
archæologizing
spirit
which
is
so
characteristic
of
the
present
time
and
which
so
often
leads
its
possessors
to
think
that
a
thing
must
be
beautiful
because
it
is
old
and
appropriate
because
it
is
beautiful
but
since
the
beauty
of
all
such
features
depends
on
their
appropriateness
they
may
in
every
case
be
replaced
by
a
more
suitable
form
of
treatment
without
loss
to
the
general
effect
of
house
or
room
it
is
this
which
makes
it
important
that
each
room
or
better
still
all
the
rooms
in
a
house
should
receive
the
same
style
of
decoration
to
some
people
this
may
seem
as
meaningless
a
piece
of
archaism
as
the
habit
of
using
obsolete
fragments
of
planning
or
decoration
but
such
is
not
the
case
it
must
not
be
forgotten
in
discussing
the
question
of
reproducing
certain
styles
that
the
essence
of
a
style
lies
not
in
its
use
of
ornament
but
in
its
handling
of
proportion
structure
conditions
ornament

ornament
and
not
represent
either
of
those
styles
of
decoration
whereas
a
room
constructed
according
to
the
laws
of
proportion
accepted
in
one
or
the
other
of
those
periods
in
spite
of
a
surface
application
of
decorative
detail
widely
different
in
character
say
romanesque
or
gothic
would
yet
maintain
its
distinctive
style
because
the
detail
in
conforming
with
the
laws
of
proportion
governing
the
structure
of
the
room
must
necessarily
conform
with
its
style
in
other
words
decoration
is
always
subservient
to
proportion
and
a
room
whatever
its
decoration
may
be
must
represent
the
style
to
which
its
proportions
belong
the
less
can
not
include
the
greater
unfortunately
it
is
usually
by
ornamental
details
rather
than
by
proportion

people
distinguish

another

these

absolutely
different

that

out
another
thing
which
has
perhaps
contributed
to
make
people
distrustful
of
styles
is
the
garbled
form
in
which
they
are
presented
by
some
architects
after
a
period
of
eclecticism
that
has
lasted
long
enough
to
make
architects
and
decorators
lose
their
traditional
habits
of
design
there
has
arisen
a
sudden
demand
for
style
it
necessarily
follows
that
only
the
most
competent
are
ready
to
respond
to
this
unexpected
summons
much
has
to
be
relearned
still
more
to
be
unlearned
the
essence
of
the
great
styles
lay
in
proportion
and
the
science
of
proportion
is
not
to
be
acquired
in
a
day
in

in
such
matters
the
cultivated
layman
whether
or
not
he
has
any
special
familiarity
with
the
different
schools
of
architecture
is
often
a
better
judge
than
the
architect
it
is
no
wonder
that
people
of
taste
are
disconcerted
by
the
colonial
houses
where
are
used
as
and
as
exterior
entablatures
or
by
louis

where
the
wavy
movement
which
in
the
best
rococo
was
always
an
ornamental
incident
and
never
broke
up
the
main
lines
of
the
design
is
suffered
to
run
riot
through
the
whole
treatment
of
the
walls
so
that
the
bewildered
eye
seeks
in
vain
for
a

is
one
thing
more
to
be

that
is

that
he
can
ever
rid
himself
of
such
an
inheritance

may

misapply

invent

the
styles
especially
suited
to
modern
life
have
already
been
roughly
indicated
as
those
prevailing
in
italy
since
in
france
from
the
time
of
louis
xiv
and
in
england
since
the
introduction
of
the
italian
manner
by
inigo

as
the
french
and
english
styles
are
perhaps
more
familiar
to
the
general
reader
the
examples
given
will
usually
be
drawn
from
these
supposing
the
argument
in
favor
of
these
styles
to
have
been
accepted
at
least
as
a
working
hypothesis
it
must
be
explained
why
in
each
room
the
decoration
and
furniture
should
harmonize
most
people
will
admit
the
necessity
of
harmonizing
the
colors
in
a
room
because
a
feeling
for
color
is
more
general
than
a
feeling
for
form
but
in
reality
the
latter
is
the
more
important
in
decoration
and
it
is
the
feeling
for
form
and
not
any
archæological
affectation
which
makes
the
best
decorators
insist
upon
the
necessity
of
keeping
to
the
same
style
of
furniture
and
decoration
thus
the
massive
dimensions
and
heavy
panelling
of
a
room
would
dwarf
a
set
of
furniture
and
the
wavy
capricious
movement
of
louis
xv
decoration
would
make
the
austere
yet
delicate
lines
of
adam
furniture
look
stiff
and
mean
many
persons
object
not
only
to
any
attempt
at
uniformity
of
style
but
to
the
use
of
any
recognized
style
in
the
decoration
of
a
room
they
characterize
it
according
to
their
individual
views
as
servile
formal
or
pretentious
it
has
already
been
suggested
that
to
conform
within
rational
limits
to
a
given
style
is
no
more
servile
than
to
pay
one
taxes
or
to
write
according
to
the
rules
of
grammar
as
to
the
accusations
of
formality
and
pretentiousness
which
are
more
often
made
in
america
than
elsewhere
they
may
probably
be
explained
by
the
fact
that
most
americans
necessarily
form
their
idea
of
the
great
european
styles
from
public
buildings
and
palaces
certainly
if
an
architect
were
to
propose
to
his
client
to
decorate
a
room
in
a
house
in
the
louis
xiv
style
and
if
the
client
had
formed
his
idea
of
that
style
from
the
state
apartments
in
the
palace
at
versailles
he
would
be
justified
in
rejecting
the
proposed
treatment
as
absolutely
unsuitable
to
modern
private
life
whereas
the
architect
who
had
gone
somewhat
more
deeply
into
the
subject
might
have
singled
out
the
style
as
eminently
suitable
having
in
mind
one
of
the
simple
panelled
rooms
with
tall
windows
a
dignified
fireplace
large
tables
and
comfortable
which
were
to
be
found
in
the
private
houses
of
the
same
period
see

the
old
story
of
the
two
knights

both

and

be
right
but
they
would
be
looking
at
the
different
sides
of
the
question
as
a
matter

fact

it
is
therefore
hoped
that
the
antagonists
of
style
when
they
are
shown
that
to
follow
a
certain
style
is
not
to
sacrifice
either
convenience
or
imagination
but
to
give
more
latitude
to
both
will
withdraw
an
opposition
which
seems
to
be
based
on
a
misapprehension
of
facts
hitherto
architecture
and
decoration
have
been
spoken
of
as
one
as
in
any
house
they
ought
to
be
indeed
it
is
one
of
the
numerous
disadvantages
of
the
present
use
of
styles
that
unless
the
architect
who
has
built
the
house
also
decorates
it
the
most
hopeless
discord
is
apt
to
result
this
was
otherwise
before
our
present
desire
for
variety
had
thrown
architects
decorators
and
workmen
out
of
the
regular
routine
of
their
business
before
the
decorator
called
upon
to
treat
the
interior
of
a
house
invariably
found
a
suitable
background
prepared
for
his
work
while
much
in
the
way
of
detail
was
intrusted
to
the
workmen
who
were
trained
in
certain
traditions
instead
of
being
called
upon
to
carry
out
in
each
new
house
the
vagaries
of
a
different
designer
but
it
is
with
the
decorator
work
alone
that
these
pages
are
concerned
and
the
above
digression
is
intended
to
explain
why
his
task
is
now
so
difficult
and
why
his
results
are
so
often
unsatisfactory
to
himself
as
well
as
to
his
clients
the
decorator
of
the
present
day
may
be
compared
to
a
person
who
is
called
upon
to
write
a
letter
in
the
english
language
but
is
ordered
in
so
doing
to
conform
to
the
chinese
or
egyptian
rules
of
grammar
or
possibly
to
both
together
by
the
use
of
a
little
common
sense
and
a
reasonable
conformity
to
those
traditions
of
design
which
have
been
tested
by
generations
of
architects
it
is
possible
to
produce
great
variety
in
the
decoration
of
rooms
without
losing
sight
of
the
purpose
for
which
they
are
intended
indeed
the
more
closely
this
purpose
is
kept
in
view
and
the
more
clearly
it
is
expressed
in
all
the
details
of
each
room
the
more
pleasing
that
room
will
be
so
that
it
is
easy
to
make
a
room
with
tinted
walls
deal
furniture
and
dimity
curtains
more
beautiful
because
more
logical
and
more
harmonious
than
a
lined
with
gold
and
marbles
in
which
the
laws
of
rhythm
and
logic
have
been
ignored

it
must

that
in
describing
the
decoration
of

we
refer
to
the
private
houses
not
the
royal
palaces
of
that
period

was
more
splendid
than
any

private

at
that
date
were
less
splendid

ii
rooms
in
general
before
beginning
to
decorate
a
room
it
is
essential
to
consider
for
what
purpose
the
room
is
to
be
used
it
is
not
enough
to
ticket
it
with
some
such
general
designation
as
library
or
den
the
individual
tastes
and
habits
of
the
people
who
are
to
occupy
it
must
be
taken
into
account
it
must
be
not
a
library
or
a
but
the
library
or
the
best
suited
to
the
master
or
mistress
of
the
house
which
is
being
decorated
individuality
in
has
seldom
been
more
harped
upon
than
at
the
present
time
that
cheap
originality
which
finds
expression
in
putting
things
to
uses
for
which
they
were
not
intended
is
often
confounded
with
individuality
whereas
the
latter
consists
not
in
an
attempt
to
be
different
from
other
people
at
the
cost
of
comfort
but
in
the
desire
to
be
comfortable
in
one
own
way
even
though
it
be
the
way
of
a
monotonously
large
majority
it
seems
easier
to
most
people
to
arrange
a
room
like
some
one
else
than
to
analyze
and
express
their
own
needs
men
in
these
matters
are
less
exacting
than
women
because
their
demands
besides
being
simpler
are
uncomplicated
by
the
feminine
tendency
to
want
things
because
other
people
have
them
rather
than
to
have
things
because
they
are
wanted
but
it
must
never
be
forgotten
that
every
one
is
unconsciously
tyrannized
over
by
the
wants
of
others
the
wants
of
dead
and
gone
predecessors
who
have
an
inconvenient
way
of
thrusting
their
different
habits
and
tastes
across
the
current
of
later
existences
the
unsatisfactory
relations
of
some
people
with
their
rooms
are
often
to
be
explained
in
this
way
they
have
still
in
their
blood
the
traditional
uses
to
which
these
rooms
were
put
in
times
quite
different
from
the
present
it
is
only
an
unconscious
extension
of
the
conscious
habit
which
people
have
of
clinging
to
their
parents
way
of
living
the
difficulty
of
reconciling
these
instincts
with
our
own
comfort
and
convenience
and
the
various
compromises
to
which
they
lead
in
the
arrangement
of
our
rooms
will
be
more
fully
dealt
with
in
the
following
chapters
to
go
to
the
opposite
extreme
and
discard
things
because
they
are
is
equally
unreasonable
the
golden
mean
lies
in
trying
to
arrange
our
houses
with
a
view
to
our
own
comfort
and
convenience
and
it
will
be
found
that
the
more
closely
we
follow
this
rule
the
easier
our
rooms
will
be
to
furnish
and
the
pleasanter
to
live
in
people
whose
attention
has
never
been
specially
called
to
the
of
sometimes
conclude
that
because
a
thing
is
unusual
it
is
artistic
or
rather
that
through
some
occult
process
the
most
ordinary
things
become
artistic
by
being
used
in
an
unusual
manner
while
others
warned
by
the
visible
results
of
this
theory
of
furnishing
infer
that
everything
artistic
is
unpractical
in
the
mind
beauty
is
not
spontaneously
born
of
material
wants
as
it
is
with
the
latin
races
we
have
to
things
beautiful
they
do
not
grow
so
of
themselves
the
necessity
of
making
this
effort
has
caused
many
people
to
put
aside
the
whole
problem
of
beauty
and
fitness
in
household
decoration
as
something
mysterious
and
incomprehensible
to
the
uninitiated
the
architect
and
decorator
are
often
aware
that
they
are
regarded
by
their
clients
as
the
possessors
of
some
strange
craft
like
black
magic
or
astrology
this
fatalistic
attitude
has
complicated
the
simple
and
intelligible
process
of
and
has
produced
much
of
the
discomfort
which
causes
so
many
rooms
to
be
shunned
by
everybody
in
the
house
in
spite
or
rather
because
of
all
the
money
and
ingenuity
expended
on
their
arrangement
yet
to
penetrate
the
mystery
of
it
is
only
necessary
to
analyze
one
satisfactory
room
and
to
notice
wherein
its
charm
lies
to
the
fastidious
eye
it
will
of
course
be
found
in
fitness
of
proportion
in
the
proper
use
of
each
moulding
and
in
the
harmony
of
all
the
decorative
processes
and
even
to
those
who
think
themselves
indifferent
to
such
detail
much
of
the
sense
of
restfulness
and
comfort
produced
by
certain
rooms
depends
on
the
due
adjustment
of
their
fundamental
parts
different
rooms
minister
to
different
wants
and
while
a
room
may
be
made
very
livable
without
satisfying
any
but
the
material
requirements
of
its
inmates
it
is
evident
that
the
perfect
room
should
combine
these
qualities
with
what
corresponds
to
them
in
a
higher
order
of
needs
at
present
however
the
subject
deals
only
with
the
material
livableness
of
a
room
and
this
will
generally
be
found
to
consist
in
the
position
of
the
doors
and
fireplace
the
accessibility
of
the
windows
the
arrangement
of
the
furniture
the
privacy
of
the
room
and
the
absence
of
the
superfluous
the
position
of
doors
and
fireplace
though
the
subject
comes
properly
under
the
head
of
may
be
included
in
this
summary
because
in
rearranging
a
room
it
is
often
possible
to
change
its
openings
or
at
any
rate
in
the
case
of
doors
to
modify
their
dimensions
the
fireplace
must
be
the
focus
of
every
rational
scheme
of
arrangement
nothing
is
so
dreary
so
hopeless
to
deal
with
as
a
room
in
which
the
fireplace
occupies
a
narrow
space
between
two
doors
so
that
it
is
impossible
to
sit
about
the
hearth
next
in
importance
come
the
windows
in
town
houses
especially
where
there
is
so
little
light
that
every
ray
is
precious
to
the
reader

worker
is
invaluable
yet
in

rooms
are
the

approach

from

with

is
no
exaggeration
to
say
that
many

are
deserted
by
the
men
of
the
family

lack
of
those
simple
comforts
which
they
find

in

invariably
supplied
with

sets
of

to
that
modern
futility

is
either
banished
or
put
in
some
dark
corner

little
wonder
that

dries
unused
and
a
vase
of
flowers
grows
in

period
the
hearth
should
be
the
place
about
which
people
gather
but
the
mantelpiece
in
the
average
american
house
being
ugly
is
usually
covered
with
inflammable
draperies
the
fire
is
in
consequence
rarely
lit
and
no
one
cares
to
sit
about
a
fireless
hearth
besides
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
is
a
gap
in
the
wall
eight
or
ten
feet
wide
opening
directly
upon
the
hall
and
exposing
what
should
be
the
most
private
part
of
the
room
to
the
scrutiny
of
messengers
servants
and
visitors
this
opening
is
sometimes
provided
with
doors
but
these
as
a
rule
are
either
slid
into
the
wall
or
are
unhung
and
replaced
by
a
curtain
through
which
every
word
spoken
in
the
room
must
necessarily
pass
in
such
a
room
it
matters
very
little
how
the
rest
of
the
furniture
is
arranged
since
it
is
certain
that
no
one
will
ever
sit
in
it
except
the
luckless
visitor
who
has
no
other
refuge
even
the
visitor
might
be
thought
entitled
to
the
solace
of
a
few
books
but
as
all
the
tables
in
the
room
are
littered
with
it
is
difficult
for
the
most
philanthropic
hostess
to
provide
even
this
slight
alleviation
when
the
is
built
on
the
basement
plan
and
the
or
parlor
is
the
family
to
escape
from
its
discomforts
habitually
take
refuge
in
the
small
room
opening
off
the
hall
on
the
ground
floor
so
that
instead
of
sitting
in
a
room
twenty
or
feet
wide
they
are
packed
into
one
less
than
half
that
size
and
exposed
to
the
frequent
intrusions
from
which
in
basement
houses
the
is
free
but
too
often
even
the
little
room
is
arranged
less
like
a
in
a
private
house
than
a
at
a
fashionable
doctor
or
dentist
it
has
the
inevitable
yawning
gap
in
the
wall
giving
on
the
hall
close
to
the
front
door
and
is
either
the
refuge
of
the
ugliest
and
most
uncomfortable
furniture
in
the
house
or
even
if
furnished
with
taste
is
arranged
with
so
little
regard
to
comfort
that
one
might
as
well
make
it
part
of
the
hall
as
is
often
done
in
rearranging
old
houses
this
habit
of
sacrificing
a
useful
room
to
the
useless
widening
of
the
hall
is
indeed
the
natural
outcome
of
furnishing
rooms
of
this
kind
in
so
unpractical
a
way
that
their
real
usefulness
has
ceased
to
be
apparent
the
science
of
restoring
wasted
rooms
to
their
proper
uses
is
one
of
the
most
important
and
least
understood
branches
of
privacy
would
seem
to
be
one
of
the
first
requisites
of
civilized
life
yet
it
is
only
necessary
to
observe
the
planning
and
arrangement
of
the
average
house
to
see
how
little
this
need
is
recognized
each
room
in
a
house
has
its
individual
uses
some
are
made
to
sleep
in
others
are
for
dressing
eating
study
or
conversation
but
whatever
the
uses
of
a
room
they
are
seriously
interfered
with
if
it
be
not
preserved
as
a
small
world
by
itself
if
the
be
a
part
of
the
hall
and
the
library
a
part
of
the
all
three
will
be
equally
unfitted
to
serve
their
special
purpose
the
indifference
to
privacy
which
has
sprung
up
in
modern
times
and
which
in
france
for
instance
has
given
rise
to
the
grotesque
conceit
of
putting
sheets
of
between
two
rooms
and
of
replacing
doorways
by
openings
fifteen
feet
wide
is
of
complex
origin
it
is
probably
due
in
part
to
the
fact
that
many
houses
are
built
and
decorated
by
people
unfamiliar
with
the
habits
of
those
for
whom
they
are
building
it
may
be
that
architect
and
decorator
live
in
a
simpler
manner
than
their
clients
and
are
therefore
ready
to
sacrifice
a
kind
of
comfort
of
which
they
do
not
feel
the
need
to
the
effects
obtainable
by
vast
openings
and
extended
vistas
to
the
untrained
observer
size
often
appeals
more
than
proportion
and
costliness
than
suitability
in
a
handsome
house
such
an
observer
is
attracted
rather
by
the
ornamental
detail
than
by
the
underlying
purpose
of
planning
and
decoration
he
sees
the
beauty
of
the
detail
but
not
its
relation
to
the
whole
he
therefore
regards
it
as
elegant
but
useless
and
his
next
step
is
to
infer
that
there
is
an
inherent
elegance
in
what
is
useless
before
beginning
to
decorate
a
house
it
is
necessary
to
make
a
prolonged
and
careful
study
of
its
plan
and
elevations
both
as
a
whole
and
in
detail
the
component
parts
of
an
undecorated
room
are
its
floor
ceiling
and
openings
the
openings
consist
of
the
doors
windows
and
fireplace
and
of
these
as
has
already
been
pointed
out
the
fireplace
is
the
most
important
in
the
general
scheme
of
decoration
no
room
can
be
satisfactory
unless
its
openings
are
properly
placed
and
proportioned
and
the
decorator
task
is
much
easier
if
he
has
also
been
the
architect
of
the
house
he
is
employed
to
decorate
but
as
this
seldom
happens
his
ingenuity
is
frequently
taxed
to
produce
a
good
design
upon
the
background
of
a
faulty
and
illogical
structure
much
may
be
done
to
overcome
this
difficulty
by
making
slight
changes
in
the
proportions
of
the
openings
and
the
skilful
decorator
before
applying
his
scheme
of
decoration
will
do
all
that
he
can
to
correct
the
fundamental
lines
of
the
room
but
the
result
is
seldom
so
successful
as
if
he
had
built
the
room
and
those
who
employ
different
people
to
build
and
decorate
their
houses
should
at
least
try
to
select
an
architect
and
a
decorator
trained
in
the
same
school
of
composition
so
that
they
may
come
to
some
understanding
with
regard
to
the
general
harmony
of
their
work
in
deciding
upon
a
scheme
of
decoration
it
is
necessary
to
keep
in
mind
the
relation
of
furniture
to
ornament
and
of
the
room
as
a
whole
to
other
rooms
in
the
house
as
in
a
small
house
a
very
large
room
dwarfs
all
the
others
so
a
room
decorated
in
a
very
rich
manner
will
make
the
simplicity
of
those
about
it
look
mean
every
house
should
be
decorated
according
to
a
carefully
graduated
scale
of
ornamentation
culminating
in
the
most
important
room
of
the
house
but
this
plan
must
be
carried
out
with
such
due
sense
of
the
relation
of
the
rooms
to
each
other
that
there
shall
be
no
violent
break
in
the
continuity
of
treatment
if
a
opens
on
a
hall
with
a
brussels
carpet
and
papered
walls
the
will
look
too
fine
and
the
hall
mean
in
the
furnishing
of
each
room
the
same
rule
should
be
as
carefully
observed
the
simplest
and
most
cheaply
furnished
room
provided
the
furniture
be
good
of
its
kind
and
the
walls
and
carpet
unobjectionable
in
color
will
be
more
pleasing
to
the
fastidious
eye
than
one
in
which
gilded
consoles
and
cabinets
of
buhl
stand
side
by
side
with
cheap
furniture
and
delicate
old
marquetry

are
covered

it
is
of
course
not

to
refurnish
a

when
it
is
redecorated
many
people
must
content
themselves
with
using
their
old
furniture
no
matter
how
ugly
and
it
may
be
and
it
is
the
decorator
business
to
see
that
his
background
helps
the
furniture
to
look
its
best
it
is
a
mistake
to
think
that
because
the
furniture
of
a
room
is
inappropriate
or
ugly
a
good
background
will
bring
out
these
defects
it
will
on
the
contrary
be
a
relief
to
the
eye
to
escape
from
the
bad
lines
of
the
furniture
to
the
good
lines
of
the

and
should
the
opportunity
to
purchase
new
furniture
ever
come
there
will
be
a
suitable
background
ready
to
show
it
to
the
best
advantage
most
rooms
contain
a
mixture
of
good
bad
and
indifferent
furniture
it
is
best
to
adapt
the
decorative
treatment
to
the
best
pieces
and
to
discard
those
which
are
in
bad
taste
replacing
them
if
necessary
by
willow
chairs
and
stained
deal
tables
until
it
is
possible
to
buy
something
better
when
the
room
is
to
be
refurnished
as
well
as
redecorated
the
client
often
makes
his
purchases
without
regard
to
the
decoration
besides
being
an
injustice
to
the
decorator
inasmuch
as
it
makes
it
impossible
for
him
to
harmonize
his
decoration
with
the
furniture
this
generally
produces
a
result
unsatisfactory
to
the
owner
of
the
house
neither
decoration
nor
furniture
however
good
of
its
kind
can
look
its
best
unless
each
is
chosen
with
reference
to
the
other
it
is
therefore
necessary
that
the
decorator
before
planning
his
treatment
of
a
room
should
be
told
what
it
is
to
contain
if
a
gilt
set
is
put
in
a
room
the
walls
of
which
are
treated
in
low
relief
and
painted
white
the
high
lights
of
the
gilding
will
destroy
the
delicate
values
of
the
mouldings
and
the
walls
at
a
little
distance
will
look
like
flat
expanses
of
whitewashed
plaster
when
a
room
is
to
be
furnished
and
decorated
at
the
smallest
possible
cost
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
comfort
of
its
occupants
depends
more
on
the
nature
of
the
furniture
than
of
the
or
carpet
in
a
of
this
kind
it
is
best
to
tint
the
walls
and
put
a
cheerful
drugget
on
the
floor
keeping
as
much
money
as
possible
for
the
purchase
of
comfortable

spent

to
be

now

have
resented

a
perversion

taste
were
the

public
as
fastidious
it
would
soon
be
easy

price

until

vulgarity

will
continue

offer
such
wares
in
preference
to
better

less
showy

worst
defects
of

made
in

are
due
to
an
athenian
thirst
for
novelty
not
always
regulated
by
an
athenian
sense
of
fitness
no
sooner
is
it
known
that
beautiful
furniture
was
made

time
of
than
an
epidemic
of
supposed
rooms
breaks
out
over
the
whole
country
neither
purchaser
nor
manufacturer
has
stopped
to
inquire
wherein
the
essentials
of
the
style
consist
they
know
that
the
rooms
of
the
period
were
usually
painted
in
light
colors
and
that
the
furniture
in
palaces
was
often
gilt
and
covered
with
brocade
and
it
is
taken
for
granted
that
plenty
of
white
paint
a
pale
with
and
fragile
chairs
dipped
in
liquid
gilding
and
covered
with
a
flowered
material
must
inevitably
produce
a
room
according
to
the
creed
of
the
modern
manufacturer
you
have
only
to
combine
certain
goods
to
obtain
a
certain
style
this
quest
of
artistic
novelties
would
be
encouraging
were
it
based
on
the
desire
for
something
better
rather
than
for
something
merely
different
the
tendency
to
dash
from
one
style
to
another
without
stopping
to
analyze
the
intrinsic
qualities
of
any
has
defeated
the
efforts
of
those
who
have
tried
to
teach
the
true
principles
of
by
a
return
to
the
best
models

people
will
buy
the
stuff

them

the
manufacturer
is
not
to
blame
for
making
it
it
is
not
the
maker
but
the
purchaser
who
sets
the
standard
and
there
will
never
be
any
general
supply
of
better
furniture
until
people
take
time
to
study
the
subject
and
find
out
wherein
lies
the
radical
unfitness
of
what
now
contents
them
until
this
golden
age
arrives
the
householder
who
can
not
afford
to
buy
old
pieces

to
have
old
models
copied

a
skilled
had
better
restrict
himself
to
the
plainest
of
furniture

for
the
embellishment

the
difficult

color

is
safe
to
say
that
the
fewer
the
colors
used
in

room
the
more
pleasing
and

result
will
be

of
colors

continuous
chatter
is
fatiguing
in
the
long
run

room
should
speak
with
but
one
voice
it
should
contain
one
color
which
at
once
and
unmistakably
asserts
its
predominance
in
obedience
to
the
rule
that
where
there
is
a
division
of
parts
one

shall
visibly
prevail

be
remedied
by

fundamentally
ugly

is
to
accept
it

the

courageously
to
correct

it
is
not
proposed
to
enter
here
into
a
technical
discussion
of
the
delicate
problem
of
proportion
the
decorator
with
whom
this
book
is
chiefly
concerned
is
generally
not
consulted
until
the
house
that
he
is
to
decorate
has
been
built
and
built
in
all
probability
quite
without
reference
to
the
interior
treatment
it
is
destined
to
receive
all
he
can
hope
to
do
is
by
slight
modifications
here
and
there
in
the
dimensions
or
position
of
the
openings
to
that
harmony
of
parts
so
frequently
disregarded
in
modern
it
often
happens
however
that
the
decorator
desire
to
make
these
slight
changes
upon
which
the
success
of
his
whole
scheme
depends
is
a
source
of
perplexity
and
distress
to
his
bewildered
client
who
sees
in
it
merely
the
inclination
to
find
fault
with
another
work
nothing
can
be
more
natural
than
this
attitude
on
the
part
of
the
client
how
is
he
to
decide
between
the
architect
who
has
possibly
disregarded
in
some
measure
the
claims
of
symmetry
and
proportion
in
planning
the
interior
of
the
house
and
the
decorator
who
insists
upon
those
claims
without
being
able
to
justify
his
demands
by
any
explanation
comprehensible
to
the
unprofessional
it
is
inevitable
that
the
decorator
who
comes
last
should
fare
worse
especially
as
he
makes
his
appearance
at
a
time
when
contractors
bills
are
pouring
in
and
the
proposition
to
move
a
mantelpiece
or
change
the
dimensions
of
a
door
opens
fresh
vistas
of
expense
to
the
client
terrified
imagination
undoubtedly
these
difficulties
have
diminished
in
the
last
few
years
architects
are
turning
anew
to
the
lost
tradition
of
symmetry
and
to
a
scientific
study
of
the
relation
between
voids
and
masses
and
the
decorator
task
has
become
correspondingly
easier
still
there
are
many
cases
where
his
work
is
complicated
by
some
trifling
obstacle
the
removal
of
which
the
client
opposes
only
because
he
can
not
in
imagination
foresee
the
improvement
which
would
follow
if
the
client
permits
the
change
to
be
made
he
has
no
difficulty
in
appreciating
the
result
he
can
not
see
it

the

serve
to
show
the
importance
of
proportion
in
all
schemes
of
decoration
and
the
necessity
of
conforming
to
certain
rules
that
may
at
first
appear
both
arbitrary
and
incomprehensible
an
architect
of
genius
ware
writes
alluding
to
the
latitude
which
the
ancients
allowed
themselves
in
using
the
orders
will
think
himself
happy
in
designing
a
building
that
is
to
be
enriched
with
the
doric
order
that
he
has
all
the
latitude
between
two
and
a
half
and
seventeen
for
the
projecture
of
its
capital
that
he
can
proportion
this
projecture
to
the
general
idea
of
his
building
anywhere
between
these
extremes
and
show
his
authority
this
is
an
happiness
to
the
person
of
real
genius
but
as
all
architects
are
not
nor
can
be
expected
to
be
of
this
stamp
it
is
needful
some
standard
should
be
established
founded
upon
what
a
good
taste
shall
most
admire
in
the
antique
and
fixed
as
a
model
from
which
to
work
or
as
a
test
to
which
we
may
have
recourse
in
disputes
and
controversies
if
to
these
words
be
added
his
happy
definition
of
the
sense
of
proportion
as
fancy
under
the
restraint
and
conduct
of
judgment
and
his
closing
caution
that
it
is
mean
in
the
undertaker
of
a
great
work
to
copy
strictly
and
it
is
dangerous
to
give
a
loose
to
fancy
a
perfect
knowledge
how
far
a
variation
may
be
the
unprofessional

form
some
idea
of
the
importance
of
proportion
and
of
the
necessity
for
observing
its
rules
if
proportion
is
the
good
breeding
of
architecture
symmetry
or
the
answering
of
one
part
to
another
may
be
defined
as
the
sanity
of
decoration
the
desire
for
symmetry
for
balance
for
rhythm
in
form
as
well
as
in
sound
is
one
of
the
most
inveterate
of
human
instincts
yet
for
years
have
been
taught
that
to
pay
any
regard
to
symmetry
in
architecture
or
decoration
is
to
truckle
to
one
of
the
meanest
forms
of
artistic
hypocrisy
the
master
who
has
taught
this
strange
creed
in
words
magical
enough
to
win
acceptance
for
any
doctrine
has
also
revealed
to
his
generation
so
many
of
the
forgotten
beauties
of
early
art
that
it
is
hard
to
dispute
his
principles
of
æsthetics
as
a
guide
through
the
byways
of
art
ruskin
is
entitled
to
the
reverence
and
gratitude
of
all
but
as
a
logical
exponent
of
the
causes
and
effects
of
the
beauty
he
discovers
his
authority
is
certainly
open
to
question
for
years
he
has
spent
the
full
force
of
his
unmatched
prose
in
denouncing
the
enormity
of
putting
a
door
or
a
window
in
a
certain
place
in
order
that
it
may
correspond
to
another
nor
has
he
scrupled
to
declare
to
the
victims
of
this
practice
that
it
leads
to
abysses
of
moral
as
well
as
of
artistic
degradation
time
has
taken
the
terror
from
these
threats
and
architects
are
beginning
to
see
that
a
regard
for
external
symmetry
far
from
interfering
with
the
requirements
of
tends
to
produce
a
better
because
a
more
carefully
studied
plan
as
well
as
a
more
convenient
distribution
of
but
in
the
lay
mind
there
still
lingers
not
only
a
vague
association
between
outward
symmetry
and
interior
discomfort
between
a
facade
and
badly
distributed
rooms
but
a
still
vaguer
notion
that
regard
for
symmetry
indicates
poverty
of
invention
lack
of
ingenuity
and
weak
subservience
to
a
meaningless
form
what
the
instinct
for
symmetry
means
philosophers
may
be
left
to
explain
but
that
it
does
exist
that
it
means
something
and
that
it
is
most
strongly
developed
in
those
races
which
have
reached
the
highest
artistic
civilization
must
be
acknowledged
by
all
students
of
sociology
it
is
therefore
not
superfluous
to
point
out
that
in
interior
decoration
as
well
as
in
architecture
a
regard
for
symmetry
besides
satisfying
a
legitimate
artistic
requirement
tends
to
make
the
average
room
not
only
easier
to
furnish
but
more
comfortable
to
live
in
illustration
in
berkeley
square
london
xviii
century
as
the
effect
produced
by
a
room
depends
chiefly
upon
the
distribution
of
its
openings
it
will
be
well
to
begin
by
considering
the
treatment
of
the
walls
it
has
already
been
said
that
the
decorator
can
often
improve
a
room
not
only
from
the
artistic
point
of
view
but
as
regards
the
comfort
of
its
inmates
by
making
some
slight
change
in
the
position
of
its
openings
take
for
instance
a
library
in
which
it
is
necessary
to
put
the
two
principal
bookcases
one
on
each
side
of
a
door
or
fireplace
if
this
opening
is
in
the
of
one
side
of
the
room
the
may
be
made
to
balance
and
the
bookcases
may
be
of
the
same
width
an
arrangement
which
will
give
to
the
room
an
air
of
spaciousness
and
repose
should
the
on
either
side
of
the
opening
be
of
unequal
extent
both
decorations
and
bookcases
must
be
modified
in
size
and
design
and
not
only
does
the
problem
become
more
difficult
but
the
result
because
necessarily
less
simple
is
certain
to
be
less
satisfactory
sometimes
on
the
other
hand
convenience
is
sacrificed
to
symmetry
and
in
such
cases
it
is
the
decorator
business
to
remedy
this
defect
while
preserving
to
the
eye
the
aspect
of
symmetry
a
long
narrow
room
may
be
taken
as
an
example
if
the
fireplace
is
in
the
centre
of
one
of
the
long
sides
of
the
room
with
a
door
directly
opposite
the
hearth
will
be
without
privacy
and
the
room
virtually
divided
into
two
parts
since
in
a
narrow
room
no
one
cares
to
sit
in
a
line
with
the
doorway
this
division
of
the
room
makes
it
more
difficult
to
furnish
and
less
comfortable
to
live
in
besides
wasting
all
the
between
the
chimney
and
the
door
one
way
of
overcoming
the
difficulty
is
to
move
the
door
some
distance
down
the
long
side
of
the
room
so
that
the
space
about
the
fireplace
is
no
longer
a
thoroughfare
and
the
privacy
of
the
greater
part
of
the
room
is
preserved
even
if
the
door
be
left
open
the
removal
of
the
door
from
the
centre
of
one
side
of
the
room
having
disturbed
the
equilibrium
of
the
openings
this
equilibrium
may
be
restored
by
placing
in
a
line
with
the
door
at
the
other
end
of
the
same
a
piece
of
furniture
corresponding
as
nearly
as
possible
in
height
and
width
to
the
door
this
will
satisfy
the
eye
which
in
matters
of
symmetry
demands
not
absolute
similarity
of
detail
but
merely
correspondence
of
outline
and
dimensions
it
is
idle
to
multiply
examples
of
the
various
ways
in
which
such
readjustments
of
the
openings
may
increase
the
comfort
and
beauty
of
a
room
every
problem
in
house
decoration
demands
a
slightly
different
application
of
the
same
general
principles
and
the
foregoing
instances
are
intended
only
to
show
how
much
depends
upon
the
placing
of
openings
and
how
reasonable
is
the
decorator
claim
to
have
a
share
in
planning
the
background
upon
which
his
effects
are
to
be
produced
it
may
surprise
those
whose
attention
has
not
been
turned
to
such
matters
to
be
told
that
in
all
but
the
most
cheaply
constructed
houses
the
interior
walls
are
invariably
treated
as
an
order
in
all
houses
even
of
the
poorest
kind
the
walls
of
the
rooms
are
finished
by
a
plain
projecting
board
adjoining
the
floor
surmounted
by
one
or
more
mouldings
this
base
as
it
is
called
is
nothing
more
nor
less
than
the
part
of
an
order
between
shaft
and
floor
or
shaft
and
pedestal
as
the
case
may
be
if
it
be
next
remarked
that
the
upper
part
of
the
wall
adjoining
the
ceiling
is
invariably
finished
by
a
moulded
projection
corresponding
with
the
crowning
member
of
an
order
it
will
be
clear
that
the
shaft
with
its
capital
has
simply
been
omitted
or
that
the
uniform
between
the
base
and
cornice
has
been
regarded
as
replacing
it
in
rooms
of
a
certain
height
and
importance
the
column
or
pilaster
is
frequently
restored
to
its
proper
place
between
base
and
cornice
but
where
such
treatment
is
too
monumental
for
the
dimensions
of
the
room
the
main
lines
of
the
should
none
the
less
be
regarded
as
distinctly
architectural
and
the
decoration
applied
should
be
subordinate
to
the
implied
existence
of
an
order
for
the
application
of
an
order
to
walls
see
plates
xlii
and
where
the
shafts
are
omitted
the
eye
undoubtedly
feels
a
lack
of
continuity
in
the
treatment
the
cornice
seems
to
hang
in
air
and
the
effect
produced
is
unsatisfactory
this
is
obviated
by
the
use
of
panelling
the
vertical
lines
carried
up
at
intervals
from
base
to
cornice
satisfying
the
need
for
some
visible
connection
between
the
upper
and
lower
members
of
the
order
moreover
if
the
lines
of
the
openings
are
carried
up
to
the
cornice
as
they
are
in
all
schemes
of
decoration
the
openings
may
be
considered
as
intercolumniations
and
the
intermediate
as
the
shafts
or
piers
supporting
the
cornice
in
rooms
the
order
is
usually
imagined
as
resting
not
on
the
floor
but
on
pedestals
or
rather
on
a
continuous
pedestal
this
continuous
pedestal
or
dado
as
it
is
usually
called
is
represented
by
a
plinth
surmounted
by
mouldings
by
an
intermediate
member
often
decorated
with
tablets
or
sunk
panels
with
moulded
margins
and
by
a
cornice
the
use
of
the
dado
raises
the
chief
of
the
room
to
a
level
with
the
eye
and
prevents
its
being
interrupted
or
concealed
by
the
furniture
which
may
be
placed
against
the
walls
this
fact
makes
it
clear
that
in
all
rooms
there
should
be
a
dado
about
two
and
a
half
feet
high
if
lower
than
this
it
does
not
serve
its
purpose
of
raising
the
to
a
line
above
the
furniture
while
the
high
dado
often
seen
in
modern
american
rooms
throws
all
the
rest
of
the
panelling
out
of
scale
and
loses
its
own
significance
as
the
pedestal
supporting
an
order
in
rooms
of
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
when
little
furniture
was
used
the
dado
was
often
richly
ornamented
being
sometimes
painted
with
delicate
arabesques
corresponding
with
those
on
the
doors
and
inside
shutters
as
rooms
grew
smaller
and
the
quantity
of
furniture
increased
so
much
that
the
dado
was
almost
concealed
the
treatment
of
the
latter
was
wisely
simplified
being
reduced
as
a
rule
to
sunk
panels
and
a
few
strongly
marked
mouldings
the
decorator
can
not
do
better
than
plan
the
ornamentation
of
his
dado
according
to
the
amount
of
furniture
to
be
placed
against
the
walls
in
corridor
or
antechamber
or
in
a
the
dado
may
receive
a
more
elaborate
treatment
than
is
necessary
in
a
library
or
where
probably
much
less
of
it
will
be
seen
it
was
not
unusual
in
the
decoration
of
lobbies
and
corridors
in
old
french
and
italian
houses
to
omit
the
dado
entirely
if
an
order
was
used
thus
bringing
the
down
to
the
but
this
was
done
only
in
rooms
or
not
meant
to
contain
any
furniture
the
three
noblest
forms
of
are
panelling
and
tapestry
hangings
in
the
best
period
of
decoration
all
three
were
regarded
as
subordinate
to
the
architectural
lines
of
the
room
the
italian
from
giotto
to
tiepolo
never
lost
sight
of
the
interrelation
between
painting
and
architecture
it
matters
not
if
the
connection
between
base
and
cornice
be
maintained
by
actual
pilasters
or
mouldings
or
by
their
painted
or
woven
imitations
the
line
and
not
the
substance
is
what
the
eye
demands
it
is
a
curious
perversion
of
artistic
laws
that
has
led
certain
critics
to
denounce
painted
architecture
or
woven
mouldings
as
in
imaginative
literature
the
author
may
present
to
his
reader
as
possible
anything
that
he
has
the
talent
to
make
the

italian
panelling
was
of
stone
marble
or
stucco
while
in
northern
europe
it
was
so
generally
of
wood
that
in
england
especially
the
term
has
become
almost
synonymous
with
and
in
some
minds
there
is
a
curious
impression
that
any
panelling
not
of
wood
is
a
sham
as
a
matter
of
fact
was
used
in
northern
europe
simply
because
it
kept
the
cold
out
more
successfully
than
a
of
stone
or
plaster
while
south
of
the
alps
its
use
was
avoided
for
the
equally
good
reason
that
in
hot
climates
it
attracts
vermin
if
priority
of
use
be
held
as
establishing
a
standard
in
decoration
should
be
regarded
as
a
sham
and
as
its
lawful
prototype
for
the
use
of
stucco
in
the
panelling
of
walls
and
ceilings
is
highly
characteristic
of
roman
interior
decoration
and
as
at
present
used
is
certainly
of
later
origin
but
nothing
can
be
more
idle
than
such
comparisons
nor
more
misleading
than
the
idea
that
stucco
is
a
sham
because
it
seeks
to
imitate
wood
it
does
not
seek
to
imitate
wood
it
is
a
recognized
substance
of
incalculable
value
for
decorative
effect
and
no
more
owes
its
place
in
decoration
to
a
fancied
resemblance
to
some
other
material
than
the
nave
of
a
cathedral
owes
its
place
in
architecture
to
the
fancied
resemblance
to
a
ship
in
the
hands
of
a
great
race
of
artistic
like
the
italians
stucco
has
produced
effects
of
beauty
which
in
any
other
substance
would
have
lost
something
of
their
freshness
their
plastic
spontaneity
from
the
delicate
traceries
of
the
roman
baths
and
the
loveliness
of
agostino
da
duccio
at
perugia
to
the
improvised
bravura
treatment
of
the
farnese
theatre
at
parma
it
has
served
through
every
phase
of
italian
art
to
embody
the
most
refined
and
studied
as
well
as
the
most
audacious
and
ephemeral
of
decorative
conceptions
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
because
painting
panelling
and
tapestry
are
the
noblest
forms
of
they
are
necessarily
the
most
unattainable
good
tapestry
is
of
course
very
expensive
and
even
that
which
is
only
mediocre
is
beyond
the
reach
of
the
average
purchaser
while
stuff
hangings
and
its
modern
successors
have
less
to
recommend
them
than
other
forms
of
with
painting
and
panelling
the
case
is
different
when
painted
walls
were
in
fashion
there
existed
below
the
great
creative
artists
schools
of
decorative
designers
skilled
in
the
art
of
from
the
simplest
kind
to
the
most
ornate
the
demand
for
such
decoration
would
now
call
forth
the
same
order
of
talent
and
many
artists
who
are
wasting
their
energies
on
the
production
of
indifferent
landscapes
and
unsuccessful
portraits
might
in
the
quite
different
field
of
decorative
painting
find
the
true
expression
of
their
talent
to
many
minds
the
mention
of
a
frescoed
room
suggests
the
image
of
a
grandiose
saloon
with
gods
and
goddesses
of
heroic
size
crowding
the
domed
ceiling
and
lofty
walls
but
the
heroic
style
of
is
only
one
of
its
many
phases
to
see
how
well
this
form
of
decoration
may
be
adapted
to
small
modern
rooms
and
to
our
present
way
of
living
it
is
only
necessary
to
study
the
walls
of
the
little
pompeian
houses
with
their
delicate
arabesques
and
slender
fanciful
figures
or
to
note
the
manner
in
which
the
italian
painters
treated
the
small
rooms
of
the
casino
or
which
formed
part
of
every
italian
examples
of
this
light
style
of
decoration
may
be
found
in
the
casino
del
grotto
in
the
grounds
of
the
palazzo
del
t
at
mantua
in
some
of
the
smaller
rooms
of
the
of
stupinigi
near
turin
and
in
the
casino
of
the
villa
valmarana
near
vicenza
where
the
frescoes
are
by
tiepolo
while
in
france
a
pleasing
instance
of
the
same
style
of
treatment
is
seen
in
the
small
octagonal
pavilion
called
the
belvédère
frescoed
by
le
riche
in
the
gardens
of
the
petit
trianon
at
versailles
as
regards
panelling
it
has
already
been
said
that
if
the
effect
produced
be
satisfactory
to
the
eye
the
substance
used
is
a
matter
of
indifference
has
the
merit
of
solidity
and
the
outlines
of
massive
stone
mouldings
are
strong
and
dignified
but
the
same
effect
may
be
produced
in
stucco
a
material
as
well
suited
to
the
purpose
as
stone
save
for
its
greater
fragility
is
adapted
to
the
most
delicate
carving
greater
sharpness
of
edge
and
clearness
of
undercutting
being
obtainable
than
in
stucco
though
this
qualification
applies
only
to
the
moulded
stucco
ornaments
used
from
economy
not
to
those
modelled
by
hand
used
in
the
latter
way
stucco
may
be
made
to
produce
the
same
effects
as
carved
wood
and
for
delicacy
of
modelling
in
low
relief
it
is
superior
to
any
other
material
there
is
in
short
little
to
choose
between
the
different
substances
except
in
so
far
as
one
or
the
other
may
commend
itself
to
the
artist
as
more
peculiarly
suited
to
the
special
requirements
of
his
design
or
to
the
practical
conditions
regulating
his
work
illustration

it
is
to
this
regard
for
practical
conditions
and
not
to
any
fancied
superiority
over
other
materials
that
the
use
of
in
northern
europe
may
most
reasonably
be
attributed
not
only
was
wood
easy
to
obtain
but
it
had
the
additional
merit
of
keeping
out
the
cold
two
qualities
sufficient
to
recommend
it
to
the
common
sense
of
french
and
english
architects
from
the
decorative
point
of
view
it
has
when
unpainted
one
undeniable
advantage
over
stucco
that
is
beauty
of
color
and
veining
as
a
background
for
the
dull
gilding
of
old
or
as
a
setting
for
tapestry
nothing
can
surpass
the
soft
rich
tones
of
oak
or
walnut
panelling
undefaced
by
the
application
of
a
shiny
varnish
with
the
introduction
of
the
orders
into
domestic
architecture
and
the
treatment
of
interior
walls
with
dado
and
cornice
the
panelling
of
the
between
those
two
members
began
to
assume
definite
proportions
in
england
and
france
before
that
time
were
often
divided
into
small
rectangles
which
from
lack
of
any
central
motive
produced
a
most
inadequate
impression
frequently
too
in
the
houses
of
the
renaissance
the
panelling
instead
of
being
carried
up
to
the
ceiling
was
terminated
two
or
three
feet
below
it
a
form
of
treatment
that
reduced
the
height
of
the
room
and
broke
the
connection
between
walls
and
ceiling
this
awkward
device
of
stunted
panelling
or
as
it
might
be
called
of
an
unduly
heightened
dado
has
been
revived
by
modern
decorators
and
it
is
not
unusual
to
see
the
walls
of
a
room
treated
as
regards
their
and
cornice
as
part
of
an
order
and
then
panelled
up
to
within
a
foot
or
two
of
the
cornice
without
apparent
regard
to
the
true
of
the
dado
see
plate
xii
if
then
the
design
of
the
is
good
it
matters
little
whether
stone
stucco
or
wood
be
used
in
all
three
it
is
possible
to
obtain
effects
ranging
from
the
grandeur
of
the
great
loggia
of
the
villa
madama
to
the
simplicity
of
any
parlor
in
a
new
england
and
from
the
greatest
costliness
to
an
outlay
little
larger
than
that
required
for
the
purchase
of
a
good
it
was
well
for
the
future
of
when
medical
science
declared
itself
against
the
use
of
these
hangings
have
in
fact
little
to
recommend
them
besides
being
objectionable
on
sanitary
grounds
they
are
inferior
as
a
to
any
form
of
treatment
however
simple
that
maintains
instead
of
effacing
the
architectural
lines
of
a
room
it
was
the
use
of
that
led
to
the
obliteration
of
the
and
and
to
the
gradual
submerging
under
a
flood
of
pattern
of
all
the
main
lines
of
the
its
merits
are
that
it
is
cheap
easy
to
put
on
and
easy
to
remove
on
the
other
hand
it
is
readily
damaged
soon
fades
and
can
not
be
cleaned
while
from
the
decorative
point
of
view
there
can
be
no
comparison
between
the
flat
meanderings
of
pattern
and
the
strong
architectural
lines
of
any
scheme
of
panelling
however
simple
sometimes
of
course
the
use
of
is
a
matter
of
convenience
since
it
saves
both
time
and
trouble
but
a
papered
room
can
never
decoratively
or
otherwise
be
as
satisfactory
as
one
in
which
the
walls
are
treated
in
some
other
manner
the
hanging
of
walls
with
chintz
or
any
other
material
is
even
more
objectionable
than
the
use
of
since
it
has
not
the
saving
merit
of
cheapness
the
custom
is
probably
a
survival
of
the
time
when
had
to
be
made
in
movable
shape
and
this
facility
of
removal
points
to
the
one
good
reason
for
using
stuff
hangings
in
a
hired
house
if
the
are
ugly
and
it
is
necessary
to
hide
them
the
rooms
may
be
hung
with
stuff
which
the
departing
tenant
can
take
away
in
other
words
stuff
hangings
are
serviceable
if
used
as
a
tent
as
a
permanent
mode
of
decoration
they
are
both
unhealthy
and
inappropriate
there
is
something
unpleasant
in
the
idea
of
a
fabric
fixed
to
the
wall
so
that
it
can
not
be
shaken
out
at
will
like
a
curtain
textile
fabrics
are
meant
to
be
moved
folded
shaken
they
have
none
of
the
qualities
of
permanence
and
solidity
which
we
associate
with
the
walls
of
a
room
the
marble
curtains
of
the
jesuit
church
in
venice
are
no
more
illogical
than
stuff
in
decorating
the
walls
of
a
room
the
first
point
to
be
considered
is
whether
they
are
to
form
a
background
for
its
contents
or
to
be
in
themselves
its
chief
decoration
in
many
cases
the
disappointing
effects
of
are
due
to
the
fact
that
this
important
distinction
has
been
overlooked
in
rooms
that
are
to
be
hung
with
prints
or
pictures
the
panelling
or
other
treatment
of
the
walls
should
be
carefully
designed
with
a
view
to
the
size
and
number
of
the
pictures
pictures
should
never
be
hung
against
a
background
of
pattern
nothing
is
more
distressing
than
the
sight
of
a
large
in
a
ponderous
frame
seemingly
suspended
from
a
spray
of
wild
roses
or
any
of
the
other
naturalistic
vegetation
of
the
modern
the
overlaying
of
pattern
is
always
a
mistake
it
produces
a
confusion
of
line
in
which
the
finest
forms
lose
their
individuality
and
significance
it
is
also
important
to
avoid
hanging
pictures
or
prints
too
close
to
each
other
not
only
do
the
colors
clash
but
the
different
designs
of
the
frames
some
of
which
may
be
heavy
with
deeply
recessed
mouldings
while
others
are
flat
and
carved
in
low
relief
produce
an
equally
discordant
impression
every
one
recognizes
the
necessity
of
selecting
the
mouldings
and
other
ornamental
details
of
a
room
with
a
view
to
their
position
in
the
scheme
of
decoration
but
few
stop
to
consider
that
in
a
room
hung
with
pictures
the
frames
take
the
place
of
and
consequently
must
be
chosen
and
placed
as
though
they
were
part
of
a
definite
decorative
composition
pictures
and
prints
should
be
fastened
to
the
wall
not
hung
by
a
cord
or
wire
nor
allowed
to
tilt
forward
at
an
angle
the
latter
arrangement
is
specially
disturbing
since
it
throws
the
out
of
the
line
of
the
wall
it
must
never
be
forgotten
that
pictures
on
a
wall
whether
set
in
panels
or
merely
framed
and
hung
inevitably
become
a
part
of
the
in
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
in
rooms
of
any
importance
pictures
were
always
treated
as
a
part
of
the
decoration
and
frequently
as
panels
sunk
in
the
wall
in
a
setting
of
carved
wood
or
stucco
mouldings
see
paintings
in
plates
v
and
xix
even
when
not
set
in
panels
they
were
always
fixed
to
the
wall
and
their
frames
whether
of
wood
or
stucco
were
made
to
correspond
with
the
ornamental
detail
of
the
rest
of
the
room
beautiful
examples
of
this
mode
of
treatment
are
seen
in
many
english
interiors
of
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
and
some
of
the
finest
carvings
of
grinling
gibbons
were
designed
for
this
purpose
even
where
the
walls
are
not
to
be
hung
with
pictures
it
is
necessary
to
consider
what
kind
of
background
the
furniture
and
objects
of
art
require
if
the
room
is
to
be
crowded
with
cabinets
bookcases
and
other
tall
pieces
and
these
as
well
as
the
tables
and
are
to
be
covered
with
porcelain
vases
bronze
statuettes
ivories
chinese
monsters
and
chelsea
groups
a
plain
background
should
be
provided
for
this
medley
should
the
room
contain
only
a
few
important
pieces
of
furniture
and
one
or
two
vases
or
busts
the
walls
against
which
these
strongly
marked
objects
are
to
be
placed
may
receive
a
more
decorative
treatment
it
is
only
in
rooms
used
for
entertaining
dining
or
some
special
purpose
for
which
little
furniture
is
required
that
the
walls
should
receive
a
more
elaborate
scheme
of
decoration
where
the
walls
are
treated
in
an
architectural
manner
with
a
dado
and

and
an
and
connecting
the
openings
with
the

be

that
in

size
the

may
be
tinted
in
a
uniform
color
and
left
unornamented
if
the
fundamental
lines
are
right
very
little
decorative
detail
is
needed
to
complete
the
effect
whereas
when
the
lines
are
wrong
no
overlaying
of
ornamental
odds
and
ends
in
the
way
of
pictures
and
other
improvised
expedients
will
conceal
the
structural
deficiencies

should
no
longer
be
living
in
houses
at
all
first
the
door
was
slid
into
the
wall
then
even
its
concealed
presence
was
resented
and
it
was
unhung
and
replaced
by
a
portière
while
of
late
it
has
actually
ceased
to
form
a
part
of
and
many
recently
built
houses
contain
doorways
even
the
front
door
which
might
seem
to
have
too
valid
a
reason
for
existence
to
be
disturbed
by
the
variations
of
fashion
has
lately
had
to
yield
its
place
in
the
more
pretentious
kind
of
house
to
a
gateway
lined
with
against
which
as
a
climax
of
inconsequence
a
thick
curtain
is
usually
hung
it
is
not
difficult
to
explain
such
architectural
vagaries
in
general
their
origin
is
to
be
found
in
the
misapplication
of
some
serviceable
feature
and
its
consequent
rejection
by
those
who
did
not
understand
that
it
had
ceased
to
be
useful
only
because
it
was
not
properly
used

century
in
the
matter
of
doors
such
an
explanation
at
once
presents
itself
during
the
latter
half
of
the
eighteenth
century
it
occurred
to
some
ingenious
person
that
when
two
adjoining
rooms
were
used
for
entertaining
and
it
was
necessary
to
open
the
doors
between
them
these
doors
might
be
in
the
way
and
to
avoid
this
possibility
a
recess
was
formed
in
the
thickness
of
the
wall
and
the
door
was
made
to
slide
into
it
this
idea
apparently
originated
in
england
for
sliding
doors
even
in
the
present
day
are
virtually
unknown
on
the
continent
and
isaac
ware
in
the
book
already
quoted
speaks
of
the
sliding
door
as
having
been
used
at
the
house
late
de
pestre
near
hanover
square
and
adds
that
the
manner
of
it
there
may
serve
as
an
example
to
other
builders
showing
it
to
have
been
a
novelty
which
he
thought
worthy
of
imitation
english
taste
has
never
been
so
sure
as
that
of
the
latin
races
and
it
has
moreover
been
perpetually
modified
by
a
passion
for
contriving
all
kinds
of
supposed
conveniences
which
instead
of
simplifying
life
not
unfrequently
tend
to
complicate
it
americans
have
inherited
this
trait
and
in
both
countries
the
architect
or
upholsterer
who
can
present
a
new
and
more
intricate
way
of
planning
a
house
or
of
making
a
piece
of
furniture
is
more
sure
of
a
hearing
than
he
who
follows
the
accepted
lines
it
is
doubtful
if
the
devices
to
which
so
much
is
sacrificed
in
english
and
american
always
offer
the
practical
advantages
attributed
to
them
in
the
case
of
the
sliding
door
these
advantages
are
certainly
open
to
question
since
there
is
no
reason
why
a
door
should
not
open
into
a
room
under
ordinary
circumstances
doors
should
always
be
kept
shut
it
is
only
as
ware
points
out
when
two
adjoining
rooms
are
used
for
entertaining
that
it
is
necessary
to
leave
the
door
between
them
open
now
between
two
rooms
destined
for
entertaining
a
double
door
deux
is
always
preferable
to
a
single
one
and
as
an
opening
four
feet
six
inches
wide
is
sufficient
in
such
cases
each
of
the
doors
will
be
only
two
feet
three
inches
wide
and
therefore
can
not
encroach
to
any
serious
extent
on
the
of
the
room
on
the
other
hand
much
has
been
sacrificed
to
the
supposed
convenience
of
the
sliding
door
first
the
decorative
effect
of
a
door
with
hinges
and
handle
of
finely
chiselled
bronze
secondly
the
privacy
of
both
rooms
since
the
difficulty
of
closing
a
heavy
sliding
door
always
leads
to
its
being
left
open
with
the
result
that
two
rooms
are
necessarily
used
as
one
in
fact
the
absence
of
privacy
in
modern
houses
is
doubtless
in
part
due
to
the
difficulty
of
closing
the
doors
between
the
rooms
the
sliding
door
has
led
to
another
abuse
in
the
exaggerated
widening
of
the
doorway
while
doors
were
hung
on
hinges
doorways
were
of
necessity
restricted
to
their
proper
dimensions
but
with
the
introduction
of
the
sliding
door
openings
eight
or
ten
feet
wide
became
possible
the
planning
of
a
house
is
often
modified
by
a
vague
idea
on
the
part
of
its
owners
that
they
may
wish
to
give
entertainments
on
a
large
scale
as
a
matter
of
fact
general
entertainments
are
seldom
given
in
a
house
of
average
size
and
those
who
plan
their
houses
with
a
view
to
such
possibilities
sacrifice
their
daily
comfort
to
an
event
occurring
perhaps
once
a
year
but
even
where
many
entertainments
are
to
be
given
large
doorways
are
of
little
use
any
architect
of
experience
knows
that
ease
of
circulation
depends
far
more
on
the
planning
of
the
house
and
on
the
position
of
the
openings
than
on
the
actual
dimensions
of
the
latter
indeed
two
doorways
leading
from
one
room
to
another
are
of
much
more
use
in
facilitating
the
movements
of
a
crowd
than
one
opening
ten
feet
wide
sliding
doors
have
been
recommended
on
the
ground
that
their
use
preserves
a
greater
amount
of
but
two
doorways
of
moderate
dimensions
properly
placed
will
preserve
as
much
as
one
very
large
opening
and
will
probably
permit
a
better
distribution
of
panelling
and
furniture
there
was
far
more
in
seventeenth
and
rooms
than
there
is
in
rooms
of
the
same
dimensions
in
the
average
modern
american
house
and
even
where
this
space
was
not
greater
in
actual
measurement
more
furniture
could
be
used
since
the
openings
were
always
placed
with
a
view
to
the
proper
arrangement
of
what
the
room
was
to
contain
according
to
the
best
authorities
the
height
of
a
doorway
should
be
twice
its
width
and
as
the
height
is
necessarily
regulated
by
the
stud
of
the
room
it
follows
that
the
width
varies
but
it
is
obvious
that
no
doorway
should
be
less
than
six
feet
high
nor
less
than
three
feet
wide
when
a
doorway
is
over
three
feet
six
inches
wide
a
pair
of
doors
should
always
be
used
while
a
single
door
is
preferable
in
a
narrow
opening
in
rooms
twelve
feet
or
less
in
height
doorways
should
not
be
more
than
nine
feet
high
the
width
of
openings
in
such
rooms
is
therefore
restricted
to
four
feet
six
inches
indeed
it
is
permissible
to
make
the
opening
lower
and
thus
reduce
its
width
to
four
feet
six
inches
of
additional
are
not
to
be
despised
in
a
room
of
average
dimensions
the
treatment
of
the
door
forms
one
of
the
most
interesting
chapters
in
the
history
of
in
feudal
castles
the
interior
doorway
for
purposes
of
defense
was
made
so
small
and
narrow
that
only
one
person
could
pass
through
at
a
time
and
was
set
in
a
plain
lintel
or
architrave
of
stone
the
door
itself
being
fortified
by
bands
of
steel
or
iron
and
by
heavy
bolts
and
bars
even
at
this
early
period
it
seems
probable
that
in
the
chief
apartments
the
lines
of
the
doorway
were
carried
up
to
the
ceiling
by
means
of
an
of
carved
wood
or
of
some
painted
decorative
composition
this
connection
between
the
doorway
and
the
ceiling
maintained
through
all
the
subsequent
phases
of
was
in
fact
never
disregarded
until
the
beginning
of
the
present
century
it
was
in
italy
that
the
door
in
common
with
the
other
features
of
private
dwellings
first
received
a
distinctly
architectural
treatment
in
italian
palaces
of
the
fifteenth
century
the
doorways
were
usually
framed
by
architraves
of
marble
enriched
with
arabesques
medallions
and
processional
friezes
in
low
relief
combined
with
disks
of
colored
marble
interesting
examples
of
this
treatment
are
seen
in
the
apartments
of
isabella
of
este
in
the
ducal
palace
at
mantua
see
plate
xiv
in
the
ducal
palace
at
urbino
and
in
the
certosa
of
pavia
some
of
the
smaller
doorways
in
this
monastery
being
decorated
with
medallion
portraits
of
the
sforzas
and
with
other
low
reliefs
of
extraordinary
beauty
the
doors
in
italian
palaces
were
usually
of
inlaid
wood
elaborate
in
composition
and
affording
in
many
cases
beautiful
instances
of
that
sense
of
material
limitation
that
preserves
one
art
from
infringing
upon
another
the
intarsia
doors
of
the
palace
at
urbino
are
among
the
most
famous
examples
of
this
form
of
decoration
it
should
be
noted
that
many
of
the
woods
used
in
italian
marquetry
were
of
a
light
shade
so
that
the
blending
of
colors
in
renaissance
doors
produces
a
sunny
tint
in
perfect
harmony
with
the
marble
architrave
of
the
doorway
the
italian
decorator
would
never
have
permitted
so
harsh
a
contrast
as
that
between
the
white
trim
and
the
mahogany
doors
of
english
houses
this
juxtaposition
of
colors
was
disapproved
by
french
decorators
also
and
was
seldom
seen
except
in
england
and
in
the
american
houses
built
under
english
influence
it
should
be
observed
too
that
the
polish
given
to
wood
in
england
and
imitated
in
the
of
the
present
day
was
never
in
favor
in
italy
and
france
shiny
surfaces
were
always
disliked
by
the
best
decorators
the
classic
revival
in
italy
necessarily
modified
the
treatment
of
the
doorway
flat
arabesques
and
delicately
chiselled
medallions
gave
way
to
a
plain
architrave
frequently
masked
by
an
order
while
the
took
the
form
of
a
pediment
or
in
the
absence
of
shafts
of
a
cornice
or
entablature
resting
on
brackets
the
use
of
a
pediment
over
interior
doorways
was
characteristic
of
italian
decoration
in
studying
italian
interiors
of
this
period
from
photographs
or
modern
prints
or
even
in
visiting
the
partly
dilapidated
palaces
themselves
it
may
at
first
appear
that
the
lines
of
the
doorway
were
not
always
carried
up
to
the
cornice
several
causes
have
combined
to
produce
this
impression
in
the
first
place
the
architectural
treatment
of
the
was
frequently
painted
on
the
wall
and
has
consequently
disappeared
with
the
rest
of
the
see
plate
xv
then
again
italian
rooms
were
often
painted
with
landscapes
and
architectural
effects
and
when
this
was
done
the
doorways
were
combined
with
these
architectural
compositions
and
were
not
treated
as
part
of
the
room
but
as
part
of
what
the
room
to
in
the
suppressed
scuola
della
carità
now
the
academy
of
fine
arts
at
venice
one
may
see
a
famous
example
of
this
treatment
in
the
doorway
under
the
stairs
leading
up
to
the
temple
in
titian
great
painting
of
the
presentation
of
the
virgin
again
in
the
italian
saloons
containing
a
gallery
or
a
clerestory
a
cornice
was
frequently
carried
around
the
walls
at
suitable
height
above
the
lower
range
of
openings
and
the
decorative
treatment
above
the
doors
windows
and
fireplace
extended
only
to
this
cornice
not
to
the
actual
ceiling
of
the
room
thus
it
will
be
seen
that
the
relation
between
the
openings
and
cornice
in
italian
decoration
was
in
reality
always
maintained
except
where
the
decorator
chose
to
regard
them
as
forming
a
part
not
of
the
room
but
of
some
other
architectural
composition
in
the
sixteenth
century
the
excessive
use
of
marquetry
was
abandoned
doors
being
panelled
and
either
left
undecorated
or
painted
with
those
light
animated
combinations
of
figure
and
arabesque
which
raphael
borrowed
from
the
roman
and
which
since
his
day
have
been
peculiarly
characteristic
of
italian
decorative
painting
in
italy
was
little
used
in
and
as
a
rule
the
panelling
of
doors
was
severely
architectural
in
character
with
little
of
the
delicate
ornamentation

the
application
of
the
orders
to
interior
doorways
was
never
very
popular
though
it
figures
in
french
architectural
works
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
architrave
except
in
houses
of
great
magnificence
was
usually
of
wood
sometimes
very
richly
carved
it
was
often
surmounted

brackets

of

of

the
great
taste

skill
were
displayed
in

decoration

earlier
part
of

seventeenth
century
doors
and
embrasures
were
usually
painted
and
nothing
in
the
way
of
decorative
painting
can
exceed
in
beauty
and
fitness
the
french
compositions
of
this
period
during
the
reign
of
louis
xiv
doors
were
either
carved
or
painted
and
their
treatment
ranged
from
the
most
elaborate
decoration
to
the
simplest
panelling
set
in
a
plain
wooden
architrave
in
some
french
doors
of
this
period
painting
and
carving
were
admirably
combined
and
they
were
further
ornamented
by
the
chiselled
locks
and
hinges
for
which
french
locksmiths
were
famous
so
important
a
part
did
these
locks
and
hinges
play
in
french
decoration
that
lebrun
himself
is
said
to
have
designed
those
in
the
galerie
in
the
louvre
when
he
composed
the
decoration
of
the
room
even
in
the
simplest
private
houses
where
chiselled
bronze
was
too
expensive
a
luxury
and
locks
and
hinges
with
plain
knobs
of
brass
or
iron
were
used
instead
such
attention
was
paid
to
both
design
and

that
it
is
almost
impossible
to
find
in

an
old
lock

already
been
pointed
out
that
even
when
the

manner
was
at

to
be

only
in

princely
houses

in
the
most
magnificent

moreover
plain
panelled
doors
were
as
common
as
those
adorned
with

in

average
private

even
where
much
ornament
was
lavished
on
the

of

the
doors
were

immediate
satisfaction
of
the
eye
is
provided
for
in
england
the
treatment
of
doorway
and
door
followed
in
a
general
way
the
italian
precedent
the
architrave
as
a
rule
was
severely
architectural
and
in
the
eighteenth
century
the
application
of
an
order
was
regarded
as
almost
essential
in
rooms
of
a
certain
importance
the
door
itself
was
sometimes
inlaid
but
oftener
simply
panelled
see
plate
xi
in
the
panelling
of
doors
english
taste
except
when
it
closely
followed
italian
precedents
was
not
always
good
the
use
of
a
pair
of
doors
in
one
opening
was
confined
to
grand
houses
and
in
the
average
dwelling
single
doors
were
almost
invariably
used
even
in
openings
over
three
feet
wide
the
great
width
of
some
of
these
single
doors
led
to
a
curious
treatment
of
the
panels
the
door
being
divided
by
a
central
stile
which
was
sometimes
beaded
as
though
instead
of
a
single
door
it
were
really
a
pair
held
together
by
some
invisible
agency
this
central
stile
is
almost
invariably
seen
in
the
doors
of
modern
american
houses
towards
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
use
of
highly
polished
mahogany
doors
became
general
in
england
it
has
already
been
pointed
out
that
the
juxtaposition
of
a
door
and
a
white
architrave
was
not
approved
by
french
and
italian
architects
blondel
in
fact
expressly
states
that
such
contrasts
are
to
be
avoided
and
that
where
walls
are
pale
in
tint
the
door
should
never
be
dark
thus
in
vestibules
and
antechambers
panelled
with
caen
stone
he
recommends
painting
the
doors
a
pale
shade
of
gray
in
italy
when
doors
were
left
unpainted
they
were
usually
made
of
walnut
a
wood
of
which
the
soft
dull
tone
harmonizes
well
with
almost
any
color
whether
light
or
dark
while
in
france
it
would
not
be
easy
to
find
an
unpainted
door

in
rooms

in

xviii

in
the
better
type
of
house
lately
built
in
america
there
is
seen
a
tendency
to
return
to
the
use
of
doors
hung
on
hinges
these
however
have
been
so
long
out
of
favor
that
the
rules
regulating
their
dimensions
have
been
lost
sight
of
and
the
modern
door
and
architrave
are
seldom
satisfactory
in
these
respects
the
principles
of
proportion
have
been
further
disturbed
by
a
return
to
the
confused
and
hesitating
system
of
panelling
prevalent
in
england
during
the
tudor
and
elizabethan
periods
the
old
french
and
italian
architects
never
failed
to
respect
that
rule
of
decorative
composition
which
prescribes
that
where
there
is
any
division
of
parts
one
part
shall
unmistakably
predominate
in
conformity
with
this
rule
the
principal
panel
in
doors
of
french
or
italian
design
is
so
much
higher
than
the
others
that
these
are
at
once
seen
to
be
merely
accessory
whereas
many
of
our
modern
doors
are
cut
up
into
so
many
small
panels
and
the
central
one
so
little
exceeds
the
others
in
height
that
they
do
not
compose
the
architrave
of
the
modern
door
has
been
neglected
for
the
same
reasons
as
the
the
use
of
the
heavy
sliding
door
which
could
not
be
opened
or
shut
without
an
effort
led
to
the
adoption
of
the
portière
and
the
architrave
being
thus
concealed
was
no
longer
regarded
as
a
feature
of
any
importance
in
the
decoration
of
the
room
the
portière
has
always
been
used
as
old
prints
and
pictures
show
but
like
the
curtain
in
earlier
days
it
was
simply
intended
to
keep
out
currents
of
air
and
was
consequently
seldom
seen
in
houses
where
double
sets
of
doors
served
far
better
to
protect
the
room
from
draughts
in
less
luxurious
rooms
where
there
were
no
double
doors
and
portières
had
to
be
used
these
were
made
as
scant
and
unobtrusive
as
possible
the
device
of
draping
stuffs
about
the
doorway
thus
substituting
a
textile
architrave
for
one
of
wood
or
stone
originated
with
the
modern
upholsterer
and
it
is
now
not
unusual
to
see
a
wide
opening
with
no
door
in
it
enclosed
in
yards
and
yards
of
draperies
which
can
not
even
be
lowered
at
will
the
portière
besides
causing
a
break
in
architectural
lines
has
become
one
of
the
chief
expenses
in
the
decoration
of
the
modern
room
indeed
the
amount
spent
in
buying
yards
of
plush
or
damask
with
the
addition
of
silk
cord
tassels
gimp
and
fringe
often
makes
it
necessary
to
slight
the
essential
features
of
the
room
so
that
an
ugly
mantelpiece
or
ceiling
is
preserved
because
the
money
required
to
replace
it
has
been
used
in
the
purchase
of
portières
these
superfluous
draperies
are
in
fact
more
expensive
than
a
door
with
hinges
and
of
chiselled
bronze
the
general
use
of
the
portière
has
also
caused
the
disappearance
of
the
the
lines
of
the
opening
being
hidden
under
a
mass
of
drapery
the
need
of
connecting
them
with
the
cornice
was
no
longer
felt
and
one
more
feature
of
the
room
passed
out
of
the
hands
into
those
of
the
upholsterer
or
as
he
might
more
fitly
be
called
the
the
return
to
better
principles
of
design
will
do
more
than
anything
else
to
restore
the
architectural
lines
of
the
room
those
who
use
portières
generally
do
so
from
an
instinctive
feeling
that
a
door
is
an
ugly
thing
that
ought
to
be
hidden
and
modern
doors
are
in
fact
ugly
but
when
architects
give
to
the
treatment
of
openings
the
same
attention
they
formerly
received
it
will
soon
be
seen
that
this
ugliness
is
not
a
necessity
and
portières
will
disappear
with
the
return
of
doors
some
general
hints
concerning
the
distribution
of
openings
have
been
given
in
the
chapter
on
walls
it
may
be
noted
in
addition
that
while
all
doorways
in
a
room
should
as
a
rule
be
of
one
height
there
are
cases
where
certain
clearly
subordinate
openings
may
be
lower
than
those
which
contain
doors
deux
in
such
cases
the
panelling
of
the
door
must
be
carefully
modified
in
accordance
with
the
dimensions
of
the
opening
and
the
treatment
of
the
in
their
relation
to
each
other
must
be
studied
with
equal
attention
examples
of
such
adaptations
are
to
be
found
in
many
old
french
and
italian
rooms
illustration
examples
of
modern
french
locksmiths
work
doors
should
always
swing
a
room
this
facilitates
entrance
and
gives
the
hospitable
impression
that
everything
is
made
easy
to
those
who
are
coming
in
doors
should
furthermore
be
so
hung
that
they
screen
that
part
of
the
room
in
which
the
occupants
usually
sit
in
small
rooms
especially
those
in
town
houses
this
detail
can
not
be
too
carefully
considered
the
fact
that
so
many
doors
open
in
the
wrong
way
is
another
excuse
for
the
existence
of
portières
a
word
must
also
be
said
concerning
the
actual
making
of
the
door
there
is
a
general
impression
that
veneered
doors
or
furniture
are
cheap
substitutes
for
articles
made
of
solid
blocks
of
wood
as
a
matter
of
fact
owing
to
the
high
temperature
of
american
houses
all
used
in
this
country
is
of
necessity
composed
of
at
least
three
and
often
of
five
layers
of
wood
this
method
of
veneering
in
which
the
layers
are
so
placed
that
the
grain
runs
in
different
directions
is
the
only
way
of
counteracting
the
shrinking
and
swelling
of
the
wood
under
artificial
heat
to
some
minds
the
concealed
door
represents
one
of
those
architectural
deceptions
which
no
necessity
can
excuse
it
is
certain
that
the
concealed
door
is
an
expedient
and
that
in
a
house
there
should
be
no
need
for
expedients
unless
the
architect
is
hampered
by
limitations
of
space
as
is
the
case
in
designing
the
average
american
town
house
architects
all
know
how
many
principles
of
beauty
and
fitness
must
be
sacrificed
to
the
restrictions
of
a
plot
of
ground
feet
wide
by
or
a
hundred
in
length
under
such
conditions
every
device
is
permissible
that
helps
to
produce
an
effect
of
spaciousness
and
symmetry
without
interfering
with
convenience
chief
among
these
contrivances
being
the
concealed
door
such
doors
are
often
useful
in
altering
or
adding
to
a
badly
planned
house
it
is
sometimes
desirable
to
give
increased
facilities
of
communication
without
adding
to
the
visible
number
of
openings
in
any
one
room
while
in
other
cases
the
limited
amount
of
may
make
it
difficult
to
find
place
for
a
doorway
corresponding
in
dimensions
with
the
others
or
again
where
it
is
necessary
to
make
a
closet
under
the
stairs
the
architrave
of
a
visible
door
may
clash
awkwardly
with
the
stringboard
under
such
conditions
the
concealed
door
naturally
suggests
itself
to
those
who
regard
its
use
as
an
offense
against
artistic
integrity
it
must
once
more
be
pointed
out
that
architecture
addresses
itself
not
to
the
moral
sense
but
to
the
eye
the
existing
confusion
on
this
point
is
partly
due
to
the
strange
analogy
drawn
by
modern
critics
between
artistic
sincerity
and
moral
law
analogies
are
the
most
dangerous
form
of
reasoning
they
connect
resemblances
but
disguise
facts
and
in
this
instance
nothing
can
be
more
fallacious
than
to
measure
the
architect
action
by
an
ethical
standard
illustration
carved
door
palace
of
versailles
louis
xv
period
showing
painted
sincerity
in
many
minds
is
chiefly
associated
with
speaking
the
truth
but
architectural
sincerity
is
simply
obedience
to
certain
visual
requirements
one
of
which
demands
that
what
are
at
once
seen
to
be
the
main
lines
of
a
room
or
house
shall
be
acknowledged
as
such
in
the
application
of
ornament
the
same
architectural
principles
demand
that
the
main
lines
of
a
room
shall
not
be
unnecessarily
interrupted
and
in
certain
cases
it
would
be
bad
taste
to
disturb
the
equilibrium
of
and
decoration
by
introducing
a
visible
door
leading
to
some
unimportant
closet
or
passageway
of
which
the
existence
need
not
be
known
to
any
but
the
inmates
of
the
house
it
is
in
such
cases
that
the
concealed
door
is
a
useful
expedient
it
can
hardly
be
necessary
to
point
out
that
it
would
be
a
great
mistake
to
place
a
concealed
door
in
a
main
opening
these
openings
should
always
be
recognized
as
one
of
the
chief
features
of
the
room
and
so
treated
by
the
decorator
but
this
point
has
already
been
so
strongly
insisted
upon
that
it
is
reverted
to
here
only
in
order
to
show
how
different
are
the
requirements
which
justify
concealment
the
concealed
door
has
until
recently
been
used
so
little
by
american
architects
that
its
construction
is
not
well
understood
and
it
is
often
hung
on
ordinary
visible
hinges
instead
of
being
swung
on
a
pivot
there
is
no
reason
why
with
proper
care
a
door
of
this
kind
should
not
be
so
nicely
adjusted
to
the
as
to
be
practically
invisible
and
to
fulfil
this
condition
is
the
first
necessity
of
its
construction

more
importance
v
windows
in
the
decorative
treatment
of
a
room
the
importance
of
openings
can
hardly
be
overestimated
not
only
do
they
represent
the
three
chief
essentials
of
its
comfort
light
heat
and
means
of
access
but
they
are
the
leading
features
in
that
combination
of
voids
and
masses
that
forms
the
basis
of
architectural
harmony
in
fact
it
is
chiefly
because
the
decorative
value
of
openings
has
ceased
to
be
recognized
that
modern
rooms
so
seldom
produce
a
satisfactory
and
harmonious
impression
it
used
to
be
thought
that
the
effect
of
a
room
depended
on
the
treatment
of
its
and
openings
now
it
is
supposed
to
depend
on
its
curtains
and
furniture
accessory
details
have
crowded
out
the
main
decorative
features
and
as
invariably
happens
when
the
relation
of
parts
is
disturbed
everything
in
the
modern
room
has
been
thrown
out
of
balance
by
this
confusion
between
the
essential
and
the
incidental
in
decoration
the
return
to
a
more
architectural
treatment
of
rooms
and
to
a
recognition
of
the
decorative
value
of
openings
besides
producing
much
better
results
would
undoubtedly
reduce
the
expense
of
a
small
quantity
of
ornament
properly
applied
will
produce
far
more
effect
than
ten
times
its
amount
used
in
the
wrong
way
and
it
will
be
found
that
when
decorators
rely
for
their
effects
on
the
treatment
of
openings
the
rest
of
the
room
will
require
little
ornamentation
the
crowding
of
rooms
with
furniture
and
is
doubtless
partly
due
to
an
unconscious
desire
to
fill
up
the
blanks
caused
by
the
lack
of
architectural
composition
in
the
treatment
of
the
walls
the
importance
of
connecting
the
main
lines
of
the
openings
with
the
cornice
having
been
explained
in
the
previous
chapter
it
is
now
necessary
to
study
the
different
openings
in
turn
and
to
see
in
how
many
ways
they
serve
to
increase
the
dignity
and
beauty
of
their
surroundings
as
is
the
main
purpose
for
which
windows
are
made
the
top
of
the
window
should
be
as
near
the
ceiling
as
the
cornice
will
allow
ventilation
the
secondary
purpose
of
the
window
is
also
better
served
by
its
being
so
placed
since
an
opening
a
foot
wide
near
the
ceiling
will
do
more
towards
airing
a
room
than
a
space
twice
as
large
near
the
floor
in
our
northern
states
where
the
dark
winter
days
and
the
need
of
artificial
heat
make
light
and
ventilation
so
necessary
these
considerations
are
especially
important
in
italian
palaces
the
windows
are
generally
lower
than
in
more
northern
countries
since
the
greater
intensity
of
the
sunshine
makes
a
much
smaller
opening
sufficient
moreover
in
italy
during
the
summer
houses
are
not
kept
cool
by
letting
in
the
air
but
by
shutting
it
out
windows
should
not
exceed
five
feet
in
width
while
in
small
rooms
openings
three
feet
wide
will
be
found
sufficient
there
are
practical
as
well
as
artistic
reasons
for
observing
this
rule
since
a
containing
a
sheet
of
glass
more
than
five
feet
wide
can
not
be
so
hung
that
it
may
be
raised
without
effort
while
a
casement
or
french
window
though
it
may
be
made
somewhat
wider
is
not
easy
to
open
if
its
width
exceeds
six
feet
the
next
point
to
consider
is
the
distance
between
the
bottom
of
the
window
and
the
floor
this
must
be
decided
by
circumstances
such
as
the
nature
of
the
view
the
existence
of
a
balcony
or
veranda
or
the
wish
to
have
a
the
outlook
must
also
be
considered
and
the
window
treated
in
one
way
if
it
looks
upon
the
street
and
in
another
if
it
gives
on
the
garden
or
informal
side
of
the
house
in
the
country
nothing
is
more
charming
than
the
french
window
opening
to
the
floor
on
the
more
public
side
of
the
house
unless
the
latter
gives
on
an
enclosed
court
it
is
best
that
the
windows
should
be
placed
about
three
feet
from
the
floor
so
that
persons
approaching
the
house
may
not
be
able
to
look
in
windows
placed
at
this
height
should
be
provided
with
a
fixed
seat
or
with
one
of
the
little
settees
with
arms
but
without
a
back
formerly
used
for
this
purpose
although
for
practical
reasons
it
may
be
necessary
that
the
same
room
should
contain
some
windows
opening
to
the
floor
and
others
raised
several
feet
above
it
the
tops
of
all
the
windows
should
be
on
a
level
to
place
them
at
different
heights
serves
no
useful
end
and
interferes
with
any
general
scheme
of
decoration
and
more
specially
with
the
arrangement
of
curtains
mullions
dividing
a
window
in
the
centre
should
be
avoided
whenever
possible
since
they
are
an
unnecessary
obstruction
to
the
view
the
chief
drawback
to
a
casement
window
is
that
its
sashes
join
in
the
middle
but
as
this
is
a
structural
necessity
it
is
less
objectionable
if
mullions
are
required
they
should
be
so
placed
as
to
divide
the
window
into
three
parts
thus
preserving
an
unobstructed
central
pane
the
window
called
palladian
illustrates
this
point
now
that
large
windows
have
ceased
to
be
a
novelty
it
will
perhaps
be
recognized
that
the
old
window
with
subdivided
panes
had
certain
artistic
and
practical
merits
that
have
of
late
been
disregarded
where
there
is
a
fine
prospect
windows
made
of
a
single
plate
of
glass
are
often
preferred
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
subdivisions
of
a
sash
while
obstructing
the
view
serve
to
establish
a
relation
between
the
inside
of
the
house
and
the
landscape
making
the
latter
what
seen
from
a
it
logically
ought
to
be
a
part
of
the
in
the
sense
of
being
subordinated
to
the
same
general
lines
a
large
unbroken
sheet
of
interrupts
the
decorative
scheme
of
the
room
just
as
in
verse
if
the
distances
between
the
rhymes
are
so
great
that
the
ear
can
not
connect
them
the
continuity
of
sound
is
interrupted
decoration
must
rhyme
to
the
eye
and
to
do
so
must
be
subject
to
the
limitations
of
the
eye
as
verse
is
subject
to
the
limitations
of
the
ear
success
in
any
art
depends
on
a
due
regard
for
the
limitations
of
the
sense
to
which
it
appeals
the
effect
of
a
perpetually
open
window
produced
by
a
large
sheet
of
while
it
gives
a
sense
of
coolness
and
the
impression
of
being
out
of
doors
becomes
for
these
very
reasons
a
disadvantage
in
cold
weather
it
is
sometimes
said
that
the
architects
of
the
eighteenth
century
would
have
used
large
plates
of
glass
in
their
windows
had
they
been
able
to
obtain
them
but
as
such
plates
were
frequently
used
for
mirrors
it
is
evident
that
they
were
not
difficult
to
get
and
that
there
must
have
been
other
reasons
for
not
employing
them
in
windows
while
the
additional
expense
could
hardly
have
been
an
obstacle
in
an
age
when
princes
and
nobles
built
with
such
royal
disregard
of
cost
the
french
always
logical
in
such
matters
having
tried
the
effect
of
are
now
returning
to
the
old
fashion
of
smaller
panes
and
in
many
of
the
new
houses
in
paris
where
the
windows
at
first
contained
large
plates
of
glass
the
latter
have
since
been
subdivided
by
a
network
of
narrow
mouldings
applied
to
the
glass
as
to
the
comparative
merits
of
french
or
casement
and
sash
windows
both
arrangements
have
certain
advantages
in
houses
built
in
the
french
or
italian
style
casement
windows
are
best
adapted
to
the
general
treatment
while
the
is
more
in
keeping
in
english
houses
perhaps
the
best
way
of
deciding
the
question
is
to
remember
that
les
fenêtres
sont
intimement
liées
aux
grandes
lignes
de
and
to
conform
to
the
rule
suggested
by
this
axiom
the
two
common
objections
to
french
windows
that
they
are
less
convenient
for
ventilation
and
that
they
can
not
be
opened
without
letting
in
cold
air
near
the
floor
are
both
unfounded
all
properly
made
french
windows
have
at
the
top
an
impost
or
stationary
part
containing
small
panes
one
of
which
is
made
to
open
thus
affording
perfect
ventilation
without
draught
another
expedient
seen
in
one
of
the
rooms
of
mesdames
de
france
at
versailles
is
a
small
pane
in
the
main
part
of
the
window
opening
on
hinges

its
own

of
french

the
disadvantage
of
not
opening
more
than
a
serious
drawback
in
our
hot
summer
climate
it
is
often
said
that
french
windows
can
not
be
opened
wide
without
interfering
with
the
curtains
but
this
difficulty
is
easily
met
by
the
use
of
curtains
made
with
cords
and
pulleys
in
the
sensible
manner
the
real
purpose
of
the
is
to
regulate
the
amount
of
light
admitted
to
the
room
and
a
curtain
so
arranged
that
it
can
not
be
drawn
backward
and
forward
at
will
is
but
a
meaningless
accessory
it
was
not
until
the
beginning
of
the
present
century
that
curtains
were
used
without
regard
to
their
practical
purpose
the
of
the
middle
ages
and
of
the
renaissance
were
simply
straight
pieces
of
cloth
or
tapestry
hung
across
the
window
without
any
attempt
at
drapery
and
regarded
not
as
part
of
the
decoration
of
the
room
but
as
a
necessary
protection
against
draughts
it
is
probably
for
this
reason
that
in
old
prints
and
pictures
representing
the
rooms
of
wealthy
people
curtains
are
so
seldom
seen
the
better
the
house
the
less
need
there
was
for
curtains
in
the
engravings
of
abraham
bosse
which
so
faithfully
represent
the
interior
decoration
of
every
class
of
french
house
during
the
reign
of
louis
xiii
it
will
be
noticed
that
in
the
richest
apartments
there
are
no
in
all
the
finest
rooms
of
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
the
inside
shutters
and
embrasures
of
the
windows
were
decorated
with
a
care
which
proves
that
they
were
not
meant
to
be
concealed
by
curtains
see
the
painted
embrasures
of
the
saloon
in

while
those
in
the
apartments
of
mesdames
de
france
on
the
ground
floor
of
the
palace
of
versailles
are
examples
of
the
most
beautiful
carving
in
fact
it
would
be
more
difficult
to
cite
a
room
of
any
importance
in
which
the
windows
were
not
so
treated
than
to
go
on
enumerating
examples
of
what
was
really
a
universal
custom
until
the
beginning
of
the
present
century
it
is
known
of
course
that
curtains
were
used
in
former
times
prints
pictures
and
inventories
alike
prove
this
fact
but
the
care
expended
on
the
decorative
treatment
of
windows
makes
it
plain
that
the
curtain
like
the
portière
was
regarded
as
a
necessary
evil
rather
than
as
part
of
the
general
scheme
of
decoration
the
meagreness
and
simplicity
of
the
curtains
in
old
pictures
prove
that
they
were
used
merely
as
window
shades
or
the
scant
straight
folds
pushed
back
from
the
tall
windows
of
the
prince
de
conti

in

of
le

are
as
obviously
utilitarian
as
the
strip
of
green
woollen
stuff
hanging
against
the
leaded
casement
of
the
mediæval
in
carpaccio
dream
of
st
ursula
another
way
of
hanging
in
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
was
to
place
them
inside
the
architrave
so
that
they
did
not
conceal
it
the
architectural
treatment
of
the
trim
and
the
practice
prevalent
at
that
period
of
carrying
the
windows
up
to
the
cornice
made
this
a
satisfactory
way
of
arranging
the
curtain
but
in
the
modern
american
house
where
the
trim
is
usually
bad
and
where
there
is
often
a
dreary
waste
of
between
the
window
and
the
ceiling
it
is
better
to
hang
the
curtains
close
under
the
cornice
it
was
not
until
the
eighteenth
century
that
the
was
divided
in
the
middle
and
this
change
was
intended
only
to
facilitate
the
drawing
of
the
hangings
which
owing
to
the
increased
size
of
the
windows
were
necessarily
wider
and
heavier
the
curtain
continued
to
hang
down
in
straight
folds
pulled
back
at
will
to
permit
the
opening
of
the
window
and
drawn
at
night
fixed
with
festoons
and
folds
so
arranged
that
they
can
not
be
lowered
or
raised
are
an
invention
of
the
modern
upholsterer
not
only
have
these
fixed
draperies
done
away
with
the
true
purpose
of
the
curtain
but
they
have
made
architects
and
decorators
careless
in
their
treatment
of
openings
the
architrave
and
embrasure
of
a
window
are
now
regarded
as
of
no
more
importance
in
the
decorative
treatment
of
a
room
than
the
inside
of
the
chimney
the
modern
use
of
the
lambrequin
as
an
ornamental
finish
to
is
another
instance
of
misapplied
decoration
its
history
is
easy
to
trace
the
mediæval
bed
was
always
enclosed
in
curtains
hanging
from
a
wooden
framework
and
the
lambrequin
was
used
as
a
kind
of
cornice
to
conceal
it
when
the
use
of
gathered
became
general
in
italy
the
lambrequin
was
transferred
from
the
bed
to
the
window
in
order
to
hide
the
clumsy
bunches
of
folds
formed
by
these
shades
when
drawn
up
in
old
prints
lambrequins
over
windows
are
almost
always
seen
in
connection
with
italian
shades
and
this
is
the
only
logical
way
of
using
them
though
they
are
often
of
service
in
concealing
the
defects
of
windows
and
unarchitectural
trim
those
who
criticize
the
architects
and
decorators
of
the
past
are
sometimes
disposed
to
think
that
they
worked
in
a
certain
way
because
they
were
too
ignorant
to
devise
a
better
method
whereas
they
were
usually
controlled
by
practical
and
artistic
considerations
which
their
critics
are
prone
to
disregard
not
only
in
judging
the
work
of
the
past
but
in
the
attempt
to
make
good
its
deficiencies
thus
the
of
the
renaissance
did
not
make
wooden
chairs
because
they
were
incapable
of
imagining
anything
more
comfortable
but
because
the
former
were
better
adapted
than
cushioned
to
the
so
frequent
at
that
period
in
like
manner
the
decorator
who
regarded
curtains
as
a
necessity
rather
than
as
part
of
the
decoration
of
the
room
knew
what
the
modern
upholsterer
fails
to
understand
that
the
beauty
of
a
room
depending
chiefly
on
its
openings
to
conceal
these
under
draperies
is
to
hide
the
key
of
the
whole
decorative
scheme
the
muslin
is
a
recent
innovation
its
only
purpose
is
to
protect
the
interior
of
the
room
from
public
view
a
need
not
felt
before
the
use
of
large
sheets
of
glass
since
it
is
difficult
to
look
through
a
subdivided
sash
from
the
outside
under
such
circumstances
muslin
curtains
are
of
course
useful
but
where
they
may
be
dispensed
with
owing
to
the
situation
of
the
room
or
the
subdivision
of
panes
they
are
no
loss
lingerie
effects
do
not
combine
well
with
architecture
and
the
more
architecturally
a
window
is
treated
the
less
it
need
be
dressed
up
in
ruffles
to
put
such
curtains
in
a
window
and
then
loop
them
back
so
that
they
form
a
mere
frame
to
the
pane
is
to
do
away
with
their
real
purpose
and
to
substitute
a
textile
for
an
architectural
effect
where
muslin
curtains
are
necessary
they
should
be
a
mere
transparent
screen
hung
against
the
glass
in
town
houses
especially
all
outward
show
of
richness
should
be
avoided
the
use
of
elaborate
curtains
besides
obstructing
the
view
seems
an
attempt
to
protrude
the
luxury
of
the
interior
upon
the
street
it
is
needless
to
point
out
the
futility
of
the
second
layer
of
muslin
which
in
some
houses
hangs
inside
the
the
solid
inside
shutter
now
so
generally
discarded
save
in
france
formerly
served
the
purposes
for
which
curtains
and
shades
are
used
and
combined
with
outside
blinds
afforded
all
the
protection
that
a
window
really
requires
see
plate
xix
these
shutters
should
be
made
with
solid
panels
not
with
slats
their
purpose
being
to
darken
the
room
and
keep
out
the
cold
while
the
light
is
regulated
by
the
outside
blinds
the
best
of
these
is
the
blind
with
wide
fixed
slats
still
to
be
seen
on
old
new
england
houses
and
always
used
in
france
and
italy
the
frail
substitute
now
in
general
use
has
nothing
to
recommend
it
footnote
as
an
example
of
the
extent
to
which
openings
have
come
to
be
ignored
as
factors
in
the
decorative
composition
of
a
room
it
is
curious
to
note
that
in
eastlake
on
household
no
mention
is
made
of
doors
windows
or
fireplaces
compare
this
point
of
view
with
that
of
the
earlier
decorators
from
vignola
to
roubo

vi
fireplaces
the
fireplace
was
formerly
always
regarded
as
the
chief
feature
of
the
room
and
so
treated
in
every
scheme
of
decoration
the
practical
reasons
which
make
it
important
that
the
windows
in
a
room
should
be
carried
up
to
the
cornice
have
already
been
given
and
it
has
been
shown
that
the
lines
of
the
other
openings
should
be
extended
to
the
same
height
this
applies
to
fireplaces
as
well
as
to
doors
and
indeed
as
an
architectural
principle
concerning
all
kinds
of
openings
it
has
never
been
questioned
until
the
present
day
the
hood
of
the
vast
gothic
fireplace
always
descended
from
the
springing
of
the
vaulted
roof
and
the
monumental
of
the
renaissance
followed
the
same
lines
see
plate

the
importance
of
giving
an
architectural
character
to

insisted
on
by
blondel
whose
remark
je

à

is
a
valuable
axiom
for
the
decorator
it
is
a
mistake
to
think
that
this
treatment
necessitates
a
large
and
a
monumental
style
of
panelling
the
smallest
mantel
surmounted
by
a
picture
or
a
mirror
set
in
simple
mouldings
may
be
as
architectural
as
the
great
at
urbino
or
cheverny
all
depends
on
the
spirit
of
the
treatment
and
on
the
proper
relation

the
different

xv
century
transition
between
gothic
and
renaissance
when
in
the
middle
ages
the
hearth
in
the
centre
of
the
room
was
replaced
by
the
the
fireplace
was
invariably
constructed
with
a
projecting
hood
of
brick
or
stone
generally
semicircular
in
shape
designed
to
carry
off
the
smoke
which
in
earlier
times
had
escaped
through
a
hole
in
the
roof
the
opening
of
the
fireplace
at
first
of
moderate
dimensions
was
gradually
enlarged
to
an
enormous
size
from
the
erroneous
idea
that
the
larger
the
fire
the
greater
would
be
the
warmth
of
the
room
by
degrees
it
was
discovered
that
the
effect
of
the
volume
of
heat
projected
into
the
room
was
counteracted
by
the
strong
draught
and
by
the
mass
of
cold
air
admitted
through
the
huge
chimney
and
to
obviate
this
difficulty
iron
doors
were
placed
in
the
opening
and
kept
closed
when
the
fire
was
not
burning
see
plate
xxi
but
this
was
only
a
partial
remedy
and
in
time
it
was
found
expedient
to
reduce
the
size
of
both
chimney
and
fireplace
in
italy
the
strong
feeling
for
architectural
lines
and
the
invariable
exercise
of
common
sense
in
construction
soon
caused
the
fireplace
to
be
sunk
into
the
wall
thus
ridding
the
room
of
the
gothic
hood
while
the
above
the
opening
received
a
treatment
of
panelling
sometimes
enclosed
in
pilasters
and
usually
crowned
by
an
entablature
and
pediment
when
the
chimney
was
not
sunk
in
the
wall
the
latter
was
brought
forward
around
the
opening
thus
forming
a
flat
to
which
the
same
style
of
decoration
could
be
applied
this
projection
was
seldom
permitted
in
italy
where
the
thickness
of
the
walls
made
it
easy
to
sink
the
fireplace
while
an
unerring
feeling
for
form
rejected
the
advancing
as
a
needless
break
in
the
of
the
room
in
france
where
gothic
methods
of
construction
persisted
so
long
after
the
introduction
of
classic
ornament
the
habit
of
building
out
the
continued
until
the
seventeenth
century
and
even
a
hundred
years
later
french
decorators
described
the
plan
of
sinking
the
fireplace
into
the
thickness
of
the
wall
as
the
italian
manner
the
thinness
of

walls
has
made
the
projecting
a
structural
necessity
but
the
composition
of
the
room
is
improved
by
furring
out
the
wall
on
each
side
of
the
fireplace
in
such
a
way
as
to
conceal
the
projection
and
obviate
a
break
in
the
where
the
room
is
so
small
that
every
foot
of
space
is
valuable

niche
may
be
formed
in
either
angle
of

preserving
the
which
would
be
sacrificed
by
advancing
the
wall
and
yet
avoiding
the
necessity
of
a
break
in
the
cornice
the
italian
plan
of
panelling
the
space
between
mantel
and
cornice
continued
in
favor
with
various
modifications
until
the
beginning
of
the
present
century
in
early
italian
renaissance
the
central
panel
was
usually
filled
by
a
but
in
the
sixteenth
century
this
was
frequently
replaced
by
a
picture
not
hung
on
the
panelling
but
forming
a
part
of
it
in
france
the
sculptured
followed
the
same
general
lines
of
development
though
the
treatment
until
the
time
of
louis
xiii
showed
traces
of
the
gothic
tendency
to
overload
with
ornament
without
regard
to
unity
of
design
so
that
the
main
lines
of
the
composition
were
often
lost
under
a
mass
of
detail
in
italy
the
early
renaissance
mantels
were
usually
of
marble
french
mantels
of
the
same
period
were
of
stone
but
this
material
was
so
unsuited
to
the
elaborate
sculpture
then
in
fashion
that
wood
was
sometimes
used
instead
for
a
season
richly
carved
wooden
covered
with
paint
and
gilding
were
in
favor
but
when
the
first
marble
mantels
were
brought
from
italy
that
sense
of
fitness
in
the
use
of
material
for
which
the
french
have
always
been
distinguished
led
them
to
recognize
the
superiority
of
marble
and
the
wooden
was
discarded
nor
has
it
since
been
used
in
france
with
the
seventeenth
century
french
became
more
architectural
in
design
and
less
florid
in
ornament
and
the
ponderous
hood
laden
with
pinnacles
escutcheons
fortified
castles
and
statues
of
saints
and
warriors
was
replaced
by
a
more
severe
decoration
thackeray
gibe
at
louis
xiv
and
his
age
has
so
long
been
accepted
by
the
races
as
a
serious
estimate
of
the
period
that
few
now
appreciate
the
artistic
preponderance
of
france
in
the
seventeenth
century
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
to
the
schools
of
art
founded
by
louis
xiv
and
to
his
magnificent
patronage
of
the
architects
and
decorators
trained
in
these
schools
that
we
owe
the
preservation
in
northern
europe
of
that
sense
of
form
and
spirit
of
moderation
which
mark
the
great
classic
tradition
to
disparage
the
work
of
men
like
levau
mansart
de
cotte
and
lebrun
shows
an
insufficient
understanding
not
only
of
what
they
did
but
of
the
inheritance
of
confused
and
turgid
ornament
from
which
they
freed
french
art
whether
our
individual
tastes
incline
us
to
the
gothic
or
to
the
classic
style
it
is
easy
to
see
that
a
school
which
tried
to
combine
the
structure
of
the
one
with
the
ornament
of
the
other
was
likely
to
fall
into
incoherent
modes
of
expression
and
this
was
precisely
what
happened
to
french
domestic
architecture
at
the
end
of
the
renaissance
period
it
has
been
the
fashion
to
describe
the
art
of
the
louis
xiv
period
as
florid
and
bombastic
but
a
comparison
of
the
designs
of
philibert
de
lorme
and
androuet
ducerceau
with
those
of
such
men
as
levau
and
robert
de
cotte
will
show
that
what
the
latter
did
was
not
to
introduce
a
florid
and
bombastic
manner
but
to
discard
it
for
what
who
will
certainly
not
be
suspected
of
undue
partiality
for
this
school
of
architects
calls
une
grandeur
solide
sans
faux
ornements
no
better
illustration
of
this
can
be
obtained
than
by
comparing
the
of
the
respective
periods
the
louis
xiv
are
much
simpler
and
more
coherent
in
design
the
caryatides
supporting
the
entablature
above
the
opening
of
the
earlier
mantels
and
the
statues
flanking
the
central
panel
of
the
are
replaced
by
massive
and
severe
mouldings
of
the
kind
which
the
french
call
see
mantels
in
plates
v
and
xxxvi
above
the
entablature
there
is
usually
a
kind
of
attic
or
high
concave
member
of
marble
often
fluted
and
forming
a
ledge
or
shelf
just
wide
enough
to
carry
the
row
of
porcelain
vases
with
which
it
had
become
the
fashion
to
adorn
the
mantel
these
vases
and
the
or
picture
occupying
the
central
panel
above
form
the
chief
ornament
of
the
though
occasionally
the
crowning
member
of
the
is
treated
with
a
decoration
of
garlands
masks
trophies
or
other
strictly
architectural
ornament
while
in
italy
and
england
the
broken
pediment
is
frequently
employed
the
use
of
a
mirror
over
the
fireplace
is
said
to
have
originated
with
mansart
but
according
to
blondel
it
was
robert
de
cotte
who
brought
about
this
innovation
thus
producing
an
immediate
change
in
the
general
scheme
of
composition
the
french
were
far
too
logical
not
to
see
the
absurdity
of
placing
a
mirror
too
high
to
be
looked
into
and
the
concave
louis
xiv
member
which
had
raised
the
six
feet
from
the
floor
was
removed
and
the
shelf
placed
directly
over

the

near

xvi
century
showing

doors
in
opening
somewhat
later
the
introduction
of
clocks
and
candelabra
as
mantel
ornaments
made
it
necessary
to
widen
the
shelf
and
this
further
modified
the
general
design
while
the
suites
of
small
rooms
which
had
come
into
favor
under
the
regent
led
to
a
reduction
in
the
size
of
and
to
the
use
of
less
massive
and
perhaps
less
architectural
ornament
in
the
eighteenth
century
in
italy
and
france
were
almost
always
composed
of
a
marble
or
stone
architrave
surmounted
by
a
shelf
of
the
same
material
while
the
consisted
of
a
mirror
framed
in
mouldings
varying
in
design
from
the
simplest
style
to
the
most
ornate
this
which
was
either
of
the
exact
width
of
the
or
some
few
inches
narrower
ended
under
the
cornice
and
its
upper
part
was
usually
decorated
in
the
same
way
as
the
in
the
room
if
these
contained
paintings
a
picture
carrying
out
the
same
scheme
of
decoration
was
often
placed
in
the
upper
part
of
the
or
the
ornaments
of
carved
wood
or
stucco
filling

panels
over

doors

repeated

part

mirrors
had
by
this
time
replaced
pictures
in
the
central
panel
of
the
but
in
italian
decoration
of
the
same
period
oval
pictures
were
often
applied
to
the
centre
of
the
mirror
with
delicate
lines
of
ornament
connecting
the
picture
and
mirror
frames
the
earliest
fireplaces
were
lined
with
stone
or
brick
but
in
the
sixteenth
century
the
more
practical
custom
of
using
iron
was
introduced
at
first
this
consisted
of
a
small
plaque
of
iron
shaped
like
a
headstone
and
fixed
at
the
back
of
the
fireplace
where
the
brick
or
stone
was
most
likely
to
be
calcined
by
the
fire
when
became
more
scientific
the
size
of
the
fireplace
was
reduced
and
the
sides
of
the
opening
were
brought
much
nearer
the
flame
thus
making
it
necessary
to
extend
the
into
a
lining
for
the
whole
fireplace
it
was
soon
seen
that
besides
resisting
the
heat
better
than
any
other
substance
the
iron
lining
served
to
radiate
it
into
the
room
the
iron
back
consequently
held
its
own
through
every
subsequent
change
in
the
treatment
of
the
fireplace
and
the
recent
return
in
england
and
america
to
brick
or
stone
is
probably
due
to
the
fact
that
the
modern
iron
lining
is
seldom
well
designed
iron
backs
were
adopted
because
they
served
their
purpose
better
than
any
others
and
as
no
new
substance
offering
greater
advantages
has
since
been
discovered
there
is
no
reason
for
discarding
them
especially
as
they
are
not
only
more
practical
but
more
decorative
than
any
other
lining
the
old
of
which
reproductions
are
readily
obtained
were
decorated
with
charming
and
their
dark
bosses
in
the
play
of
the
firelight
form
a
more
expressive
background
than
the
dead
and
unresponsive
surface
of
brick
or
stone
it
was
not
uncommon
in
england
to
treat
the
mantel
as
an
order
crowned
by
its
entablature
where
this
was
done
an
intermediate
space
was
left
between
mantel
and
an
arrangement
which
somewhat
weakened
the
architectural
effect
a
better
plan
was
that
of
surmounting
the
entablature
with
an
attic
and
making
the
spring
directly
from
the
latter
fine
examples
of
this
are
seen
at
holkham
built
by
brettingham
for
the
earl
of
leicester
about
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
english
fireplace
was
modified
at
the
end
of
the
seventeenth
century

coal
began
to
replace

chippendale
gives
many
designs
for

such
as
were
set
in
the
large
fireplaces
originally
intended
for
wood
for
it
was
not
until
later
that
chimneys
with
smaller
openings
were
specially
constructed
to
receive
the
fixed
grate
and
the
it
was
in
england
that
the
architectural
treatment
of
the
was
first
abandoned
the
use
of
a
mirror
framed
in
a
panel
over
the
fireplace

never
become
general
in
england
and
toward
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
was
frequently
surmounted
by
a
blank
on
which
a
picture
or
a
small
round
mirror
was
hung
high
above
the
shelf
see
plate
xlvii
examples
are
seen
in
moreland
pictures
and
in
prints
of
simple
english
interiors
but
this
treatment
is
seldom
found
in
rooms
of
any
architectural
pretensions
the
early
american
fireplace
was
merely
a
cheap
provincial
copy
of
english
models
of
the
same
period
the
application
of
the
word
colonial
to
architecture
and
decoration
has
created
a
vague
impression
that
there
existed
at
that
time
an
american
architectural
style
as
a
matter
of
fact
colonial
architecture
is
simply
a
modest
copy
of
georgian
models
and
colonial
were
either
imported
from
england
by
those
who
could
afford
it
or
were
reproduced
in
wood
from
current
english
designs
wooden
mantels
were
indeed
not
unknown
in
england
where
the
use
of
a
wooden
architrave
led
to
the
practice
of
facing
the
fireplace
with
dutch
tiles
but
wood
was
used
both
in
england
and
america
only
from
motives
of
cheapness
and
the
architrave
was
set
back
from
the
opening
only
because
it
was
unsafe
to
put
an
inflammable
material
so
near
the
fire
after
all
the
best
american
houses
contained
imported
marble
these
usually
consisted
of
an
entablature
resting
on
columns
or
caryatides
with
a
frieze
in
low
relief
representing
some
classic
episode
or
simply
ornamented
with
bucranes
and
garlands
in
the
general
decline
of
taste
which
marked
the
middle
of
the
present
century
these
dignified
and
were
replaced
by
marble
arches
containing
a
fixed
grate
the
hideousness
of
this
arched
opening
soon
produced
a
distaste
for
marble
mantels
in
the
minds
of
a
generation
unacquainted
with
the
early
designs
this
distaste
led
to
a
reaction
in
favor
of
wood
resulting
in
the
displacement
of
the
architrave
and
the
facing
of
the
space
between
architrave
and
opening
with
tiles
iron
or
marble
people
are
beginning
to
see
that
the
ugliness
of
the
marble
of
does
not
prove
that
wood
is
the
more
suitable
material
to
employ
there
is
indeed
something
of
unfitness
in
the
use
of
an
inflammable
material
surrounding
a
fireplace
everything
about
the
hearth
should
not
only
be
but
the
chief
objection
to
wood
is
that
its
use
necessitates
the
displacement
of
the
architrave
thus
leaving
a
flat
intermediate
space
to
be
faced
with
some
material
this
is
an
architectural
fault
a
door
of
which
the
architrave
should
be
set
back
eighteen
inches
or
more
to
admit
of
a
facing
of
tiles
or
marble
would
be
pronounced
unarchitectural
and
it
is
usually
admitted
that
all
classes
of
openings
should
be
subject
to
the
same
general
treatment
where
the
is
of
wood
the
setting
back
of
the
architrave
is
a
necessity
but
curiously
enough
the
practice
has
become
so
common
in
england
and
america
that
even
where
the
mantel
is
made
of
marble
or
stone
it
is
set
back
in
the
same
way
so
that
it
is
unusual
to
see
a
modern
fireplace
in
which
the
architrave
defines
the
opening
in
france
also
the
use
of
an
inner
facing
called
a
has
become
common
probably
because
such
a
device
makes
it
possible
to
use
less
fuel
while
not
disturbing
the
proportions
of
the
mantel
as
related
to
the
room
the
reaction
from
the
bare
stiff
rooms
of
the
first
quarter
of
the
present
century
the
era
of
mahogany
and
horsehair
resulted
some
twenty
years
since
in
a
general
craving
for
and
the
latter
soon
spread
from
the
tables
to
the
mantel
especially
in
england
and
america
where
the
absence
of
the
architectural
left
a
bare
expanse
of
wall
above
the
the
use
of
the
mantel
as
a
shelf
led
in
time
to
the
lengthening
and
widening
of
this
shelf
and
in
consequence
to
the
enlargement
of
the
whole
mantels
which
in
the
eighteenth
century
would
have
been
thought
in
scale
with
rooms
of
certain
dimensions
would
now
be
considered
too
small
and
insignificant
the
use
of
large
besides
throwing
everything
in
the
room
out
of
scale
is
a
structural
mistake
since
the
excessive
projection
of
the
mantel
has
a
tendency
to
make
the
fire
smoke
indeed
the
proportions
of
the
old
mantels
far
from
being
arbitrary
were
based
as
much
on
practical
as
on
artistic
considerations
moreover
the
use
of
long
wide
shelves
has
brought
about
the
accumulation
of
superfluous
whereas
a
smaller
mantel
if
architecturally
designed
would
demand
only
its
conventional
of
clock
and
candlesticks
the
device
of
concealing
an
ugly
by
folds
of
drapery
brings
an
inflammable
substance
so
close
to
the
fire
that
there
is
a
suggestion
of
danger
even
where
there
is
no
actual
risk
the
lines
of
a
mantel
however
bad
represent
some
kind
of
solid
architrave
a
more
suitable
setting
for
an
architectural
opening
than
flimsy
festoons
of
brocade
or
plush
any
one
who
can
afford
to
replace
an
ugly
by
one
of
good
design
will
find
that
this
change
does
more
than
any
other
to
improve
the
appearance
of
a
room
where
a
badly
designed
mantel
can
not
be
removed
the
best
plan
is
to
leave
it
unfurbelowed
simply
placing
above
it
a
mirror
or
panel
to
connect
the
lines
of
the
opening
with
the
cornice
the
effect
of
a
fireplace
depends
much
upon
the
good
taste
and
appropriateness
of
its
accessories
little
attention
is
paid
at
present
to
the
design
and
workmanship
of
these
and
like
necessary
appliances
yet
if
good
of
their
kind
they
add
more
to
the
adornment
of
a
room
than
a
multiplicity
of
useless
andirons
should
be
of
bronze
or
ormolu
substances
which
require
constant
polishing
such
as
steel
or
brass
are
unfitted
to
a
fireplace
it
is
no
longer
easy
to
buy
the
old
bronze
andirons
of
french
or
italian
design
with
pedestals
surmounted
by
statuettes
of
nymph
or
faun
to
which
time
has
given
the
iridescence
that
modern
vainly
try
to
reproduce
with
varnish
these
bronzes
and
the
old
ormolu
andirons
are
now
almost
but
the
french
artisan
still
copies
the
old
models
with
fair
success

andirons
should
not
only
harmonize
with
the
design
of
the
mantel
but
also
be
in
scale
with
its
dimensions
in
the
fireplace
of
a
large
boudoir
andirons
would
look
insignificant
while
the
monumental
renaissance
would
dwarf
a
small
mantel
and
make
its
ornamentation
trivial
if
andirons
are
gilt
they
should
be
of
ormolu
the
cheaper
kinds
of
gilding
are
neither
durable
nor
good
in

plain
iron
is
preferable
to
anything
but
bronze
or
the
design

accord
with
that
of
the

such
details

form
a

barrier
between

and
those
who
wish
to
approach
it

the
latter
objection
applies
also
to
the
massive
folding

that
is
too
heavy
to
be
removed
like

be

the
unnecessary
use
of
substances
which
require
constant
polishing
is
one
of
the
mysteries
of
english
and
american
housekeeping
it
is
difficult
to
see
why
a
housemaid
should
spend
hours
in
polishing
brass
or
steel
fenders
andirons
and
when
all
these
articles
might
be
made
of
some
substance
that
does
not
need
daily
cleaning

is
burned

better
can
be
found
than
an
old
carved
chest
either
one
of

their
painted
panels
and
gilded
volutes
or
a
plain
box
of
oak
or
walnut
with

and

the
best
substitute
for
such
a
chest
is
a
plain
wicker
basket
without
ornamentation
enamel
paint
or
gilding
if
an
article
of
this
kind
is
not
really
beautiful
it
had
better
be
as
obviously
utilitarian
as
possible

a
word
may
be
said
of
the
which
until
thirty
or
forty
years
ago
were
used
to
close
the
opening
of
the
fireplace
in
summer
these
are
now
associated
with
parlors
where
they
are
still
sometimes
seen
covered
with
a
paper
like
that
on
the
walls
and
looking
ugly
enough
to
justify
their
disuse
the
old
were
very
different
in
rooms
of
any
importance
they
were
beautifully
decorated
and
in
italian
interiors
where
the
dado
was
often
painted
the
same
decoration
was
continued
on
the
sometimes
the
latter
were
papered
but
the
paper
used
was
designed
expressly
for
the
purpose
with
a
decorative
composition
of
flowers
landscapes
or
the
on
which
the
designer
played
such
endless
variations
whether
the
fireplace
in
summer
should
be
closed
by
a
board
or
left
open
with
the
logs
laid
on
the
irons
is
a
question
for
individual
taste
but
it
is
certain
that
if
the
painted
were
revived
it
might
form
a
very
pleasing
feature
in
the
decoration
of
modern
rooms
the
only
possible
objection
to
its
use
is
that
it
interferes
with
ventilation
by
closing

as

used
only
at

season
when
all

are

this
drawback
is
hardly
worth
considering
in
spite
of
the
fancied
advancement
in
refinement
and
luxury
of
living
the
development
of
the
modern
heating
apparatus
seems
likely
especially
in
america
to
do
away
with
the
open
fire
the
temperature
maintained
in
most
american
houses
by
means
of
or
pipes
is
so
high
that
even
the
slight
additional
warmth
of
a
wood
fire
would
be
unendurable
still
there
are
a
few
exceptions
to
this
rule
and
in
some
houses
the
healthy
glow
of
open
fires
is
preferred
to
the
parching
atmosphere
of
steam
indeed
it
might
almost
be
said
that
the
good
taste
and
of
the
inmates
of
a
house
may
be
guessed
from
the
means
used
for
heating
it
old
pictures
old
furniture
and
fine
bindings
can
not
live
in
a
atmosphere
and
those
who
possess
such
treasures
and
know
their
value
have
an
additional
motive
for
keeping
their
houses
cool
and
well
ventilated
no
house
can
be
properly
aired
in
winter
without
the
draughts
produced
by
open
fires
fortunately
doctors
are
beginning
to
call
attention
to
this
neglected
detail
of
sanitation
and
as
dry
artificial
heat
is
the
main
source
of
throat
and
lung
diseases
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
the
growing
taste
for
life
and
sports
will
bring
about
a
desire
for
better
ventilation
and
a
dislike
for
stoves
and
aside
from
the
question
of
health
and
personal
comfort
nothing
can
be
more
cheerless
and
depressing
than
a
room
without
fire
on
a
winter
day
the
more
torrid

the
more
abnormal
is
the
contrast
between
the
cold
hearth
and
the
incandescent
temperature

a
fire
the
is
as
comfortless
as
the
best
parlor
of
a
new

the
empty
fireplace
shows
that
the
room
is
not
really
lived
in
and
that
its
appearance
of
luxury
and
comfort
is
but
a
costly
sham
prepared
for
the
edification
of
visitors
footnotes
in
italy
where
the

were

are

at

at

this
practice
accounts
for
the
fact
that
in

a
blank

it
is
to
be
hoped
that
the

translation
of

will
do
much
to
remove
this
prejudice
it
is
curious
that
those
who
criticize
the

of

are
often
the
warmest
admirers
of

an

the

of
this
book
nor
would
it
serve
any
practical
purpose
to
trace
the
early
forms
of
vaulting
and
timbering
which
preceded
the
general
adoption
of
the
modern
plastered
ceiling
to
understand
the
development
of
the
modern
ceiling
however
one
must
trace
the
two
very
different
influences
by
which
it
has
been
shaped
that
of
the
timber
roof
of
the
north
and
that
of
the
brick
or
stone
vault
of
the
latin
builders
this
twofold
tradition
has
curiously
affected
the
details
of
the
modern
ceiling
during
the
renaissance
flat
plaster
ceilings
were
not
infrequently
coffered
with
stucco
panels
exactly
reproducing
the
lines
of
timber
framing
and
in
the
villa
vertemati
near
chiavenna
there
is
a
curious
and
interesting
ceiling
of
carved
wood
made
in
imitation
of
stucco
see
plate
xxiii
while
one
of
the
rooms
in
the
palais
de
justice
at
rennes
contains
an
elaborate
vaulted
ceiling
constructed
entirely
of
wood
with
mouldings
nailed
on
see
plate
xxiv
in
northern
countries
where
the
ceiling
was
simply
the
under
side
of
the
wooden
floor
it
was
natural
that
its
decoration
should
follow
the
rectangular
subdivisions
formed
by
open
in
the
south
however
where
the
floors
were
generally
of
stone
resting
on
stone
vaults
the
structural
conditions
were
so
different
that
although
the
use
of
caissons
based
on
the
divisions
of
was
popular
both
in
the
roman
and
renaissance
periods
the
architect
always
felt
himself
free
to
treat
the
ceiling
as
a
flat
undivided
surface
prepared
for
the
application
of
ornament
the
idea
that
there
is
anything
unarchitectural
in
this
method
comes
from
an
imperfect
understanding
of
the
construction
of
roman
ceilings
the
vault
was
the
typical
roman
ceiling
and
the
vault
presents
a
smooth
surface
without
any
structural
projections
to
modify
the
ornament
applied
to
it
the
panelling
of
a
vaulted
or
flat
ceiling
was
as
likely
to
be
agreeable
to
the
eye
as
a
similar
treatment
of
the
walls
but
the
roman
coffered
ceiling
and
its
renaissance
successors
were
the
result
of
a
strong
sense
of
decorative
fitness
rather
than
of
any
desire
to
adhere
to
structural
limitations
examples
of
the
timbered
ceiling
are
indeed
to
be
found
in
italy
as
well
as
in
france
and
england
and
in
venice
the
flat
wooden
ceiling
panelled
upon
structural
lines
persisted
throughout
the
renaissance
period
but
in
rome
where
the
classic
influences
were
always
much
stronger
and
where
the
discovery
of
the
stucco
ceilings
of
ancient
baths
and
palaces
produced
such
lasting
effects
upon
the
architecture
of
the
early
renaissance
the
decorative
treatment
of
the
stone
vault
was
transferred
to
the
flat
or
coved
renaissance
ceiling
without
a
thought
of
its
being
inapplicable
or
insincere
the
fear
of
insincerity
in
the
sense
of
concealing
the
anatomy
of
any
part
of
a
building
troubled
the
renaissance
architect
no
more
than
it
did
his
gothic
predecessor
who
had
never
hesitated
to
stretch
a
ciel
of
cloth
or
tapestry
over
the
naked
timbers
of
the
mediæval
ceiling
the
duty
of
exposing
structural
forms
an
obligation
that
weighs
so
heavily
upon
the
conscience
of
the
modern
architect
is
of
very
recent
origin
mediæval
as
well
as
renaissance
architects
thought
first
of
adapting
their
buildings
to
the
uses
for
which
they
were
intended
and
then
of
decorating
them
in
such
a
way
as
to
give
pleasure
to
the
eye
and
the
maintenance
of
that
relation
which
the
eye
exacts
between
main
structural
lines
and
their
ornamentation
was
the
only
form
of
sincerity
which
they

cared

the
italian

did
not

to

by
any
pedantic

to
structural

the
eye
once
satisfied
that
the

the
fit

of
its
decoration
was
considered
far
more
important
than
mere
technical
fidelity
to
the
outline
of
and
joists
if
the
italian
decorator
wished
to
adorn
a
ceiling
with
carved
or
painted
panels
he
used
the
lines
of
the
timbering
to
frame
his
panels

naturally
accorded

decorative
scheme
while
were
a
large

painting

be
employed

be
covered
with
reliefs

felt
no
more
hesitation
in
deviating
from
the
lines
of
the
timbering
than
he
would
have
felt
in
planning
the
pattern
of
a
mosaic

a
marble
floor
without
reference
to
the
beneath

it
was
natural
that
should
long

it
was
to
be
expected
that
both
in
france

england
the
national
form
should
be
preserved
long
after
italian
influences
had
established
themselves
in
both
countries
in
fact
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
in
france
where
the
artistic
feeling
was
much
finer
and
the
sense
of
fitness
and
power
of
adaptation
were
more
fully
developed
than
in
england
the
lines
of
the
timbered
ceiling
persisted
throughout
the
renaissance
and
louis

periods
whereas
in
england
the
elizabethan
architects
lost
in
the
mazes
of
italian
detail
without
a
guiding
perception
of
its
proper
application
abandoned
the
timbered
ceiling
with
its
eminently
architectural
subdivisions
for
a
flat
plaster
surface
over
which
geometrical
flowers
in
stucco
meandered
in
endless
sinuosities
unbroken
by
a
single
moulding
and
repeating
themselves
with
the
maddening
persistency
of
pattern
this
style
of
ornamentation
was
done
away
with
by
inigo
jones
and
his
successors
who
restored
the
architectural
character
of
the
ceiling
whether
flat
or
vaulted
and
thereafter
panelling
persisted
in
england
until
the
french
revolution
brought
about
the
general
downfall
of
taste
in
france
at
the
beginning
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
liking
for
led
to
greater
lightness

kinds

the

period
while
pleasing
in
detail
are
open
to
the
criticism
of
being
somewhat
weak
in
form
still
they
are
always
and
their
light
traceries
though
perhaps
too
dainty
and
fragile
in
themselves
are
so
disposed
as
to
form
a
clearly
marked
design
instead
of
being
allowed
to
wander
in
a
monotonous
network
over
the
whole
surface
of
the
ceiling
like
the
ubiquitous
tudor
rose
isaac

trained
in
the
principles
of
form
which
the
teachings
of
inigo
jones
had
so
deeply
impressed
upon
english
architects
ridicules
the
petty
wildnesses
of
the
french
style
but
if
the
louis
xv
ceiling
lost
for
a
time
its
architectural
character
this
was
soon
to
be
restored
by
gabriel
and
his
followers
while
at
the
same
period

forcible
mouldings

endless
modifications
of

are
to
be

in

architectural
treatises
of
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
as
well
as
in
the
buildings
of

a

ceiling
greatly
increases
the
apparent
height
of

but
rooms
of
this
kind
should
not
be
treated
with
an
order
since
the
projection
of
the
cornice
below
the
springing
of
the

will
lower
the
walls
so
much
as
to
defeat
the
purpose
for
which
the
cove
has
been
used
in
such
rooms
the
cove
should
rise
directly
from
the
walls
and
this
treatment
suggests
the
important
rule
that
where
the
cove
is
not
supported
by
a
cornice
the
ceiling
decoration
should
be
of
very
light
character
a
heavy
panelled
ceiling
should
not
rest
on
the
walls
without
the
intervention
of
a
strongly
profiled
cornice
the
french
louis
xv
decoration
with
its
fanciful
embroidery
of
stucco
ornament
is
well
suited
to
coved
ceilings
springing
directly
from
the
walls
in
a
room
of
low
stud
while
a
ceiling
divided
into
panels
with
heavy
architectural
mouldings
whether
it
be
flat
or
vaulted
looks
best
when
the
walls
are
treated
with
a
complete
order
durand
in
his
lectures
on
architecture
in
speaking
of
cornices
lays
down
the
following
excellent
rules
interior
cornices
must
necessarily
differ
more
or
less
from
those
belonging
to
the
orders
as
used
externally
though
in
rooms
of
reasonable
height
these
differences
need
be
but
slight
but
if
the
stud
be
low
as
sometimes
is
inevitable
the
cornice
must
be
correspondingly
narrowed
and
given
an
excessive
projection
in
order
to
increase
the
apparent
height
of
the
room
moreover
as
in
the
interior
of
the
house
the
light
is
much
less
bright
than
outside
the
cornice
should
be
so
profiled
that
the
juncture
of
the
mouldings
shall
form
not
right
angles
but
acute
angles
with
spaces
between
the
mouldings
serving
to
detach
the
latter
still
more
clearly
from
each
other
the
choice
of
the
substance
out
of
which
a
ceiling
is
to
be
made
depends
somewhat
upon
the
dimensions
of
the
room
the
height
of
the
stud
and
the
decoration
of
the
walls
a
heavily
panelled
wooden
ceiling
resting
upon
walls
either
frescoed
or
hung
with
stuff
is
likely
to
seem
oppressive
but
as
in
all
other
kinds
of
decoration
the
effect
produced
depends
far
more
upon
the
form
and
the
choice
of
ornamental
detail
than
upon
the
material
used
wooden
ceilings
however
both
from
the
nature
of
the
construction
and
the
kind
of
ornament
which
may
most
suitably
be
applied
to
them
are
of
necessity
rather
heavy
in
appearance
and
should
therefore
be
used
only
in
large
and
rooms
the
walls
of
which
are
panelled
in
wood
stucco
and
are
adapted
to
every
variety
of
decoration
from
the
light
traceries
of
a
boudoir
ceiling
to
the
dome
of
the
à
but
the
design
must
be
chosen
with
strict
regard
to
the
size
and
height
of
the
room
and
to
the
proposed
treatment
of
its
walls
the
cornice
forms
the
connecting
link
between
walls
and
ceiling
and
it
is
essential
to
the
harmony
of
any
scheme
of
decoration
that
this
important
member
should
be
carefully
designed
it
is
useless
to
lavish
money
on
the
adornment
of
walls
and
ceiling
connected
by
an
ugly
cornice
the
same
objections
extend
to
the
clumsy
plaster
mouldings
which
in
many
houses
disfigure
the
ceiling
to
paint
or
gild
a
ceiling
of
this
kind
only
attracts
attention
to
its
ugliness
when
the
expense
of
removing
the
mouldings
and
filling
up
the
holes
in
the
plaster
is
considered
too
great
it
is
better
to
cover
the
bulbous
rosettes
and
pendentives
with
kalsomine
than
to
attempt
their
embellishment
by
means
of
any
polychrome
decoration
the
cost
of
removing
plaster
ornaments
is
not
great
however
and
a
small
outlay
will
replace
an
ugly
cornice
by
one
of
architectural
design
so
that
a
little
economy
in
buying
or
often
makes
up
for
the
additional
expense
of
these
changes
one
need
only
look
at
the
ceilings
in
the
average
modern
house
to
see
what
a
thing
of
horror
plaster
may
become
in
the
hands
of
an
untrained
designer
the
same
general
principles
of
composition
suggested
for
the
treatment
of
walls
may
be
applied
to
thus
it
is
essential
that
where
there
is
a
division
of
parts
one
part
shall
perceptibly
predominate
and
this
in
a
ceiling
should
be
the
central
division
the
chief
defect
of
the
coffered
renaissance
ceiling
is
the
lack
of
this
predominating
part
great
as
may
have
been
the
decorative
skill
expended
on
the
treatment
of
beams
and
panels
the
coffered
ceiling
of
divisions
seems
to
press
down
upon
the
head
whereas
the
large
central
panel
gives
an
idea
of
height
that
the
great
were
quick
to
enhance
by
glimpses
of
cloud
and
sky
or
some
aerial
effect

the
different
angle
and
greater
distance
at
which
ceilings
are
viewed
demand
a
quite
different
treatment
and
it
is
to
the
disregard
of
this
fact
that
most
badly
designed
ceilings
owe
their
origin
even
in
the
high
days
of
art
there
was
a
tendency
on
the
part
of
some
decorators
to
confound
the
two
plane
surfaces
of
wall
and
ceiling
and
one
might
cite
many
which
have
been
transferred
to
the
ceiling
without
being
rearranged
to
fit
their
new
position
instances
of
this
kind
have
never
been
so
general
as
in
the
present
day
the
reaction
from
the
badly
designed
mouldings
and
fungoid
growths
that
characterized
the
ceilings
of
forty
years
ago
has
led
to
the
use
of
attenuated
combined
with
other
puny
attributes
taken
from
sheraton
cabinets
and
adam
these
ornaments
always
somewhat
lacking
in
character
become
absolutely
futile
when
viewed
from
below
this
ornamentation
is
a
direct
precedent
to
the
modern
ceiling
covered
with
one
would
think
that
the
inappropriateness
of
this
treatment
was
obvious
but
since
it
has
become
popular
enough
to
warrant
the
manufacture
of
specially
designed
some
protest
should
be
made
the
necessity
for
hiding
cracks
in
the
plaster
is
the
reason
most
often
given
for
papering
ceilings
but
the
cost
of
mending
cracks
is
small
and
a
plaster
ceiling
lasts
much
longer
than
is
generally
thought
it
need
never
be
taken
down
unless
it
is
actually
falling
and
as
repairs
strengthen
and
improve
the
entire
surface
a
ceiling
is
stronger
than
one
that
is
just
beginning
to
crack
if
the
cost
of
repairing
must
be
avoided
a
smooth
white
should
be
chosen
in
place
of

the
showy
and
vulgar
papers

serve

the
best
field
for
the
study
of
this
branch
of
art
from
the
vaults
of
the
fifteenth
century
with
their
roman
arabesques
and
framing
human
figures
detached
as
mere
ornament
against
a
background
of
solid
color

the
massive
goddesses
and

the
carracci
and
to
the
perspectives
of

of
prestidigitators
culminating
in
the
great
tiepolo
italian
art
affords
examples
of
every
temperament
applied
to
the
solution
of
one
of
the
most
interesting
problems
in
decoration
such
ceilings
as
those
on
which
raphael
and
giovanni
da
udine
worked
together
combining
painted
arabesques
and
medallions
with
stucco
reliefs
are
admirably
suited
to
small
rooms
and
might
well
be
imitated
by
painters
incapable
of
higher
things
there
is
but
one
danger
in
adapting
this
decoration
to
modern
use
that
is
the
temptation
to
sacrifice
scale
and
general
composition
to
the
search
after
refinement
of
detail
it
can
not
be
denied
that
some
of
the
decorations
of
the
school
of
giovanni
da
udine
are
open
to
this
criticism
the
ornamentation
of
the
great
loggia
of
the
villa
madama
is
unquestionably
out
of
scale
with
the
dimensions
of
the
structure
much
exquisite
detail
is
lost
in
looking
up
past
the
great
piers
and
the
springing
of
the
massive
arches
to
the
that
adorns
the
vaulting
in
this
case
the
composition
is
less
at
fault
than
the
scale
the
decorations
of
the
at
the
villa
madama
if
transferred
to
a
small
mezzanin
room
would
be
found
to
compose
perfectly
charming
examples
of
the
use
of
this
style
in
small
apartments
may
be
studied
in
the
rooms
of
the
casino
del
grotto
near
mantua
the
tendency
of
many
modern
decorators
to
sacrifice
composition
to
detail
and
to
neglect
the
observance
of
proportion
between
ornament
and
structure
makes
the
adaptation
of
renaissance
stucco
designs
a
somewhat
hazardous
undertaking
but
the
very
care
required
to
preserve
the
scale
and
to
accentuate
the
general
lines
of
the
design
affords
good
training
in
the
true
principles
of
composition
equally
well
suited
to
modern
use
are
the
designs
in
arabesque
with
which
in
france
bérain
and
his
followers
painted
the
ceilings
of
small
rooms
during
the
louis
xiv
period
see
plate
xxvi
with
the
opening
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
bérain
arabesques

by
the
touch
of
watteau

monkeys

side
with
the
monumental
work
of
such
artists
as
lebrun
and
lesueur
coypel
vouet
and
natoire
this
light
style
of
composition
was
always
in
favor
for
the
decoration
of
the
most
famous
painters
of
the
day
did
not
think
it
beneath
them
to
furnish
designs
for
such
purposes
see
plate
xxvii
in
rooms
which
are
to
be
decorated
in
a
simple
and
inexpensive
manner
a
plain
plaster
ceiling
with
cornice
is
preferable
to
any
device
for
producing
showy
effects
at
small
cost
it
may
be
laid
down
as
a
general
rule
in
that
what
must
be
done
cheaply
should
be
done
simply
it
is
better
to
pay
for
the
best
plastering
than
to
use
a
cheaper
quality
and
then
to
cover
the
cracks
with
lincrusta
or
this
is
true
of
all
such
expedients
let
the
fundamental
work
be
good
in
design
and
quality
and
the
want
of
ornament
will
not
be
felt
in
america
the
return
to
a
more
substantial
way
of
building
and
the
tendency
to
discard
wood
for
brick
or
stone
whenever
possible
will
doubtless
lead
in
time
to
the
use
of
brick
stone
or
marble
floors
these
floors
associated
in
the
minds
of
most
americans
with
shivering
expeditions
through
damp
italian
palaces
are
in
reality
perfectly
suited
to
the
dry
american
climate
and
even
the
most
anæmic
person
could
hardly
object
to
brick
or
marble
covered
by
heavy
rugs
the
inlaid
marble
floors
of
the
italian
palaces
whether
composed
of
square
or
blocks
or
decorated
with
a
large
design
in
different
colors
are
unsurpassed
in
beauty
while
in
rooms
where
there
is
little
pattern
on
the
walls
and
a
small
amount
of
furniture
elaborately
designed
mosaic
floors
with
sweeping
arabesques
and
geometrical
figures
are
of
great
decorative
value
floors
of
these
substances
have
the
merit
of
being
not
only
more
architectural
in
character
more
solid
and
durable
but
also
easier
to
keep
clean
this
should
especially
commend
them
to
the
american
housekeeper
since
floors
that
may
be
washed
are
better
suited
to
our
climate
than
those
which
must
be
covered
with
a
carpet
next
in
merit
to
brick
or
marble
comes
the
parquet
of
oak
or
other
hard
wood
but
even
this
looks
inadequate
in
rooms
of
great
architectural
importance
in
a
floor
is
generally
regarded
as
a
necessity
but
in
vestibule
staircase
or
saloon
marble
is
superior
to
anything
else
the
design
of
the
parquet
floor
should
be
simple
and
unobtrusive
the
french
who
brought
this
branch
of
to
perfection
would
never
have
tolerated
the
crudely
contrasted
woods
that
make
the
modern
parquet
so
aggressive
like
the
walls
of
a
room
the
floor
is
a
background
it
should
not
furnish
pattern
but
set
off
whatever
is
placed
upon
it
the
perspective
effects
dear
to
the
modern
are
the
climax
of
extravagance
a
floor
should
not
only
be
but
appear
to
be
a
perfectly
level
surface
without
simulated
bosses
or
concavities
in
choosing
rugs
and
carpets
the
subject
of
design
should
be
carefully
studied
the
oriental
have
always
surpassed
their
european
rivals
the
patterns
of
eastern
rugs
are
invariably
well
composed
with
skilfully
conventionalized
figures
in
flat
unshaded
colors
even
the
oriental
rug
of
the
present
day
is
well
drawn
but
the
colors
used
by
eastern
manufacturers
since
the
introduction
of
aniline
dyes
are
so
discordant
that
these
rugs
are
inferior
to

modern
european

the
designing
of

has
improved
so
much
in
the
last
ten
or
fifteen
years
that
a
sufficient
choice
of
unobtrusive
geometrical
patterns
may
now
be
found
the
composition
of
european
carpets
woven
in

piece

has
never
been
satisfactory
even
the
splendid

made
in

at
the
royal
manufactory
during
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
were
not
so
true
to
the
best
principles
of
design
as
the
old
oriental
rugs
in
europe
there
was
always
a
tendency
to
transfer

or
to
such
incongruities
as
architectural
mouldings
highly
modelled
trophies
and
human
masks
appear
in
most
of
the
european
carpets
from
the
time
of
louis
xiv
to
the
present
day
and
except
when
copying
eastern
models
the
european
designers
were
subject
to
strange
lapses
from
taste
there
is
no
reason
why
a
painter
should
not
simulate
loggia
and
sky
on
a
flat
plaster
ceiling
since
no
one
will
try
to
use
this
sham
opening
as
a
means
of
exit
but
the
who
puts
and
human
faces
under
foot
though
he
does
not
actually
deceive
produces
on
the
eye
a
momentary
startling
sense

obstruction

is
permissible
in

art
if
it
gives
an
impression

pleasure

the
inherent
sense

fitness
is
shocked
by
the
act
of
walking
upon
upturned
faces
recent
though
usually
free
from
such
obvious
incongruities
have
seldom
more
than
a
negative
merit
the
unconventionalized
flower
still
shows
itself
and
even
when
banished
from
the
centre
of
the
carpet
lingers
in
the
border
which
accompanies
it
the
vulgarity
of
these
borders
is
the
chief
objection
to
using
carpets
of
european
manufacture
as
rugs
instead
of
nailing
them
to
the
floor
it
is
difficult
to
find
a
border

is
not
too
wide

which
the
design
is

simple
conventional

always

of

not
cut
to
follow
all
the
ins

produce
an

contrast
with

is
technically
known
as

has
in
our

modern
speech
come
to
be
designated
as
the
hall

gwilt

the
staircase
is
defined
as
that
part
or
subdivision
of
a
building
containing
the
stairs
which
enable
people
to
ascend
or
descend
from
one
floor
to
another
while
the
hall
is
described
as
follows
the
first
large
apartment
on
entering
a
house
in
magnificent
edifices
where
the
hall
is
larger
and
loftier
than
usual
and
is
placed
in
the
middle
of
the
house
it
is
called
a
saloon
and
a
royal
apartment
consists
of
a
hall
or
chamber
of
guards
etc
it
is
clear
that
in
the
technical
acceptance
of
the
term
a
hall
is
something
quite
different
from
a
staircase
yet
the
two
words
were
used
interchangeably
by
so
early
a
writer
as
isaac
ware
who
in
his
body
of
published
in
continually
speaks
of
the
staircase
as
the
hall
this
confusion
of
terms
is
difficult
to
explain
for
in
early
times
the
staircase
was
as
distinct
from
the
hall
as
it
continued
to
be
in
france
and
italy
and
with
rare
exceptions
in
england
also
until
the
present
century

usually
contained
several
staircases
no
one
of
which
was
more
important

the
others

stairs
first

classes

developed
from
the
eleventh
century
onward
in
the
comparative
security
of
the
walled
town
it
was
natural
that
should
be
less
irregular
and
that
more
regard
should
be
given
to
considerations
of
comfort
and
dignity
in
early
italian
palaces
the
stairs
either
ascended
through
the
open
central
to
an
arcaded
gallery
on
the

in
the

at

up
in

was
in

the
usual
way
of
building
stairs
in
italy

the
end
of
the
fifteenth
century

that
the
monumental
staircase
so
often
regarded
as
one
of
the
chief
features
of
the
italian
renaissance
began
to
be
built
indeed
a
detailed
examination
of
the
italian
palaces

that
even
in
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth

such
staircases
as

upon

is

in
his
dictionary
of

under
the
heading
has
given
a
sympathetic
and
ingenious
explanation
of
the
tenacity
with
which
the
french
aristocracy
clung
to
the
obsolete
complications
of
gothic
and
structure
long
after
frequent
expeditions
across
the
alps
had
made
them
familiar
with
the
simpler
and
more
rational
method
of
the
italian
architects
it
may
be
as
he
suggests
that
centuries
of
feudal
life
with
its
surface
of
savagery
and
violence
and
its
undercurrent
treachery
had
fostered
in
the
nobles
of
northern
europe
a
desire
for
security
and
isolation
that
found
expression
in
the
intricate
planning
of
their
castles
long
after
the
advance
of
civilization
had
made
these
precautions
unnecessary
it
seems
more
probable
however
that
the
french
architects
of
the
renaissance
made
the
mistake
of
thinking
that
the
essence
of
the
classic
styles
lay
in
the
choice
and
application
of
ornamental
details
this
exaggerated
estimate
of
the
importance
of
detail
is
very
characteristic
of
an
imperfect
culture
and
the
french
architects
who
in
the
fifteenth
century
were
eagerly
taking
their
first
lessons
from
their
contemporaries
south
of
the
alps
had
behind
them
nothing
like
the
great
synthetic
tradition
of
the
italian
masters
certainly
it
was
not
until
the
northern
builders
learned
that
the
beauty
of
the
old
buildings
was
above
all
a
matter
of
proportion
that
their
own
style
freed
from
its
earlier
incoherencies
set
out
on
the
line
of
unbroken
national
development
which
it
followed
with
such
harmonious
results
until
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
in
italy
the
staircase
often
gave
directly
upon
the
entranceway
in
france
it
was
always
preceded
by
a
vestibule
and
the
upper
landing
invariably
led
into
an
antechamber
in
england
the
relation
between
vestibule
hall
and
staircase
was
never
so
clearly
established
as
on
the
continent
the
old
english
hall
so
long
the
centre
of
feudal
life
preserved
its
somewhat
composite
character
after
the
of
france
and
italy
had
been
broken
up
into
the
vestibule
the
and
the
saloon
in
the
grandest
tudor
houses
the
usually
opened
directly
into
this
hall
to
obtain
in
some
measure
the
privacy
which
a
vestibule
would
have
given
the
end
of
the
hall
nearest
the

often
cut
off
by
a
screen
that
supported
the
musicians
gallery
the
corridor
formed
by
this
screen
led
to
the
staircase
usually
placed
behind
the
hall
and
the
gallery
opened
on
the
first
landing
of
the
stairs
this
use
of
the
screen
at
one
end
of
the
hall
had
so
strong
a
hold
upon
english
habits
that
it
was
never
quite
abandoned
even
after
french
architecture
and
had
come
into
fashion
in
the
eighteenth
century
a
house
with
a
vestibule
remained
the
rarest
of
exceptions
in
england
and
the
relative
privacy
afforded
by
the
gothic
screen
was
then
lost
by
substituting
for
the
latter
an
open
arcade
of
great
decorative
effect
but
ineffectual
in
shutting
off
the
hall
from
the
front
door
the
introduction
of
the
palladian
style
by
inigo
jones
transformed
the
long
and
often
narrow
tudor
hall
into
the
central
saloon
of
the
italian
villa
with
galleries
reached
by
concealed
staircases
and
lofty
domed
ceiling
but
it
was
still
called
the
hall
it
still
served
as
a
vestibule
or
means
of
access
to
the
rest
of
the
house
and
curiously
enough
it
usually
adjoined
another
apartment
often
of
the
same
dimensions
called
a
saloon
perhaps
the
best
way
of
defining
the
english
hall
of
this
period
is
to
say
that
it
was
really
an
italian
saloon
but
that
it
was
used
as
a
vestibule
and
called
a
hall
through
all
these
changes
the
staircase
remained
shut
off
from
the
hall
upon
which
it
usually
opened
it
was
very
unusual
except
in
small
houses
or
suburban
villas
to
put
the
stairs
in
the
hall
or
more
correctly
speaking
to
make
the
front
door
open
into
the
staircase
there
are
however
several
larger
houses
in
which
the
stairs
are
built
in
the
hall
inigo
jones
in
remodelling
castle
ashby
for
the
earl
of
northampton
followed
this
plan
though
this
is
perhaps
not
a
good
instance
to
cite
as
it
may
have
been
difficult
to
find
place
for
a
separate
staircase
at
chevening
in
kent
built
by
inigo
jones
for
the
earl
of
sussex
the
stairs
are
also
in
the
hall

the
same
arrangement
is
seen
at

the
stairs
are

eighteenth
century

this
digression
has
been
made
in
order
to
show
the
origin
of
the
modern
english
and
american
practice
of
placing
the
stairs
in
the
hall
and
doing
away
with
the
vestibule
the
vestibule
never
formed
part
of
the
english
house
but
the
stairs
were
usually
divided
from
the
hall
in
houses
of
any
importance
and
it
is
difficult
to
see
whence
the
modern
architect
has
derived
his
idea
of
the
combined
hall
and
staircase
the
tendency
to
merge
into
one
any
two
apartments
designed
for
different
uses
shows
a
retrogression
in
and
while
it
is
fitting
that
the
vestibule
or
hall
should
adjoin
the
staircase
there
is
no
good
reason
for
uniting
them
and
there
are
many
for
keeping
them
apart
the
staircase
in
a
private
house
is
for
the
use
of
those
who
inhabit
it
the
vestibule
or
hall
is
necessarily
used
by
persons
in
no
way
concerned
with
the
private
life
of
the
inmates
if
the
stairs
the
main
artery
of
the
house
be
carried
up
through
the
vestibule
there
is
no
security
from
intrusion
even
the
plan
of
making
the
vestibule
precede
the
staircase
though
better
is
not
the
best
in
a
properly
planned
house
the
vestibule
should
open
on
a
hall
or
antechamber
of
moderate
size
giving
access
to
the
rooms
on
the
ground
floor

this
antechamber
should
lead
into
the

all
the
are

marked
the
architecture
of
the
day
in
the
seventeenth
and
early
eighteenth
centuries
they
were
noted
for
severe
richness
of
design
with
the
development
of
the
rocaille
manner
their
lines
grew
lighter
and
more
fanciful
while
the
influence
of
gabriel
which
toward
the
end
of
the
reign
of
louis
xv
brought
about
a
return
to
classic
models
manifested
itself
in
a
simplified
mode
of
treatment
at
this
period
the
outline
of
a
classic
baluster
formed
a
favorite
motive
for
the
iron
rail
toward
the
close
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
designs
for
these
rails
grew
thin
and
poor
with
a
predominance
of
upright
iron
bars
divided
at
long
intervals
by
some
meagre
medallion
or
geometrical
figure
the
exuberant
sprays
and
volutes
of
the
rococo
period
and
the
architectural
lines
of
the
louis
xvi
style
were
alike
absent
from
these
later
designs
which
are
chiefly
marked
by
the
negative
merit
of
inoffensiveness
in
the
old
french
steel
was
sometimes
combined
with
gilded
iron
the
famous
of
the
palais
royal
designed
by
coutant
is
made
of
steel
and
iron
and
the
duc
copied
this
combination
in
the
at
chantilly
there
is
little
to
recommend
the
substitution
of
steel
for
iron
in
such
cases
it
is
impossible
to
keep
a
steel
clean
and
free
from
rust
except
by
painting
it
and
since
it
must
be
painted
iron
is
the
more
suitable
material
in
france
the
iron
rail
is
usually
painted
black
though
a
very
dark
blue
is
sometimes
preferred
black
is
the
better
color
as
it
forms
a
stronger
contrast
with
the
staircase
walls
which
are
presumably
neutral
in
tint
and
severe
in
treatment
besides
as
iron
is
painted
not
to
improve
its
appearance
but
to
prevent
its
rusting
the
color
which
most
resembles
its
own
is
more
appropriate
in
french
houses
of
a
certain
importance
the
iron
often
had
a
few
touches
of
gilding
but
these
were
sparingly
applied
in
england
wooden
were
in
great
favor
during
the
tudor
and
elizabethan
period
these
rails
were
marked
rather
by
fanciful
elaboration
of
detail
than
by
intrinsic
merit
of
design
and
are
doubtless
more
beautiful
now
that
time
has
given
them
its
patina
than
they
were
when
first
made
with
the
palladian
style
came
the
classic
balustrade
of
stone
or
marble
or
sometimes
in
simpler
houses
of
wood
iron
rails
were
seldom
used
in
england
and
those
to
be
found
in
some
of
the
great
london
houses
as
in
carlton
house
chesterfield
house
and
norfolk
house
were
probably
due
to
the
french
influence
which
made
itself
felt
in
english
domestic
architecture
during
the
eighteenth
century
this
influence
however
was
never
more
than
sporadic
and
until
the
decline
of
decorative
art
at
the
close
of
the
eighteenth
century
italian
rather
than
french
taste
gave
the
note
to
english
decoration
the
interrelation
of
vestibule
hall
and
staircase
having
been
explained
the
subject
of
decorative
detail
must
next
be
considered
but
before
turning
to
this
it
should
be
mentioned
that
hereafter
the
space
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
though
properly
a
part
of
the
staircase
will
for
the
sake
of
convenience
be
called
since
in
the
present
day
it
goes
by
that
name
in
england
and
america
in
contrasting
the
vestibule
with
the
hall
it
was
pointed
out
that
the
latter
might
be
treated
in
a
gayer
and
more
informal
manner
than
the
former
it
must
be
remembered
however
that
as
the
vestibule
is
the
introduction
to
the
hall
so
the
hall
is
the
introduction
to
the
of
the
house
and
it
follows
that
the
hall
must
be
as
much
more
formal
than
the
as
the
vestibule
is
more
formal
than
the
hall
it
is
necessary
to
emphasize
this
because
the
tendency
of
recent
english
and
american
decoration
has
been
to
treat
the
hall
not
as
a
hall
but
as
a
whatever
superficial
attractions
this
treatment
may
possess
its
inappropriateness
will
be
seen
when
the
purpose
of
the
hall
is
considered
the
hall
is
a
means
of
access
to
all
the
rooms
on
each
floor
on
the
ground
floor
it
usually
leads
to
the
chief
of
the
house
as
well
as
to
the
vestibule
and
street
in
addition
to
this
in
modern
houses
even
of
some
importance
it
generally
contains
the
principal
stairs
of
the
house
so
that
it
is
the
centre
upon
which
every
part
of
the
house
directly
or
indirectly
opens
this
publicity
is
increased
by
the
fact
that
the
hall
must
be
crossed
by
the
servant
who
opens
the
front
door
and
by
any
one
admitted
to
the
house
it
follows
that
the
hall
in
relation
to
the
rooms
of
the
house
is
like
a
public
square
in
relation
to
the
private
houses
around
it
for
some
reason
this
obvious
fact
has
been
ignored
by
many
recent
decorators
who
have
chosen
to
treat
halls
like
rooms
of
the
most
informal
character
with
open
fireplaces
for
lounging
and
reading
tables
with
lamps
books
and
magazines
and
all
the
appointments
of
a
library
this
disregard
of
the
purpose
of
the
hall
like
most
mistakes
in
household
decoration
has
a
very
natural
origin
when
in
the
first
reaction
from
the
discomfort
and
formality
of
sixty
years
ago
people
began
especially
in
england
to
study
the
arrangement
of
the
old
tudor
and
elizabethan
houses
many
of
these
were
found
to
contain
large
panelled
halls
opening
directly
upon
the
porch
or
the
terrace
the
mellow
tones
of
the
the
bold
treatment
of
the
stairs
shut
off
as
they
were
merely
by
a
screen
the
heraldic
imagery
of
the
hooded
stone
and
of
the
carved
or
stuccoed
ceiling
made
these
halls
the
chief
feature
of
the
house
while
the
rooms
opening
from
them
were
so
often
insufficient
for
the
requirements
of
modern
existence
that
the
life
of
the
inmates
necessarily
centred
in
the
hall
visitors
to
such
houses
saw
only
the
picturesqueness
of
the
arrangement
the
huge
logs
glowing
on
the
hearth
the
books
and
flowers
on
the
old
carved
tables
the
family
portraits
on
the
walls
and
charmed
with
the
impression
received
they
ordered
their
architects
to
reproduce
for
them
a
hall
which
even
in
the
original
tudor
houses
was
a
survival
of
older
social
conditions
one
might
think
that
the
recent
return
to
classic
forms
of
architecture
would
have
done
away
with
the
tudor
hall
but
except
in
a
few
instances
this
has
not
been
the
case
in
fact
in
the
greater
number
of
large
houses
and
especially
of
country
houses
built
in
america
since
the
revival
of
renaissance
and
palladian
architecture
a
large
hall
communicating
directly
with
the
vestibule
and
containing
the
principal
stairs
of
the
house
has
been
the
distinctive
feature
if
there
were
any
practical
advantages
in
this
overgrown
hall
it
might
be
regarded
as
one
of
those
rational
modifications
in
plan
which
mark
the
difference
between
an
unreasoning
imitation
of
a
past
style
and
the
intelligent
application
of
its
principles
but
the
tudor
hall
in
its
composite
character
as
vestibule
parlor
and
is
only
another
instance
of
the
sacrifice
of
convenience
to
archaism
illustration
staircase
in
the
palace
of
fontainebleau
louis
xv
period
the
abnormal
development
of
the
modern
can
not
be
defended
on
the
plea
sometimes
advanced
that
it
is
a
adaptation
of
the
great
open
of
the
genoese
palace
since
there
is
no
reason
for
adapting
a
plan
so
useless
and
so
unsuited
to
our
climate
and
way
of
living
the
beautiful
central
of
the
italian
palace
with
its
monumental
open
stairs
was
in
no
sense
part
of
a
private
house
in
our
interpretation
of
the
term
it
was
rather
a
thoroughfare
like
a
public
street
since
the
various
stories
of
the
italian
palace
were
used
as
separate
houses
by
different
branches
of
the
family
in
most
modern
houses
the
hall
in
spite
of
its
studied
resemblance
to
a
soon
reverts
to
its
original
use
as
a
passageway
and
this
fact
should
indicate
the
treatment
best
suited
to
it
in
rooms
where
people
sit
and
where
they
are
consequently
at
leisure
to
look
about
them
delicacy
of
treatment
and
refinement
of
detail
are
suitable
but
in
an
anteroom
or
a
staircase
only
the
first
impression
counts
and
forcible
simple
lines
with
a
vigorous
massing
of
light
and
shade
are
essential
these
conditions
point
to
the
use
of
severe
panelling
niches
for
vases
or
statues
and
a
detaching
itself
from
the
background
in
vigorous
decisive
lines
the
furniture
of
the
hall
should
consist
of
benches
or
chairs
and
tables
and
consoles
if
a
press
is
used
it
should
be
architectural
in
design
like
the
old
french
and
italian
painted
with
arabesques
and
architectural
motives
or
the
english
presses
made
of
some
wood
like
walnut
and
surmounted
by
a
broken
pediment
with
a
vase
or
bust
in
the
centre
see
plate
xxxiii
the
walls
of
the
staircase
in
large
houses
should
be
of
panelled
stone
or
marble
as
in
the
examples
given
in
the
plates
accompanying
this
chapter
in
small
houses
where
an
expensive
decoration
is
out
of
the
question
a
somewhat
similar
architectural
effect
may
be
obtained
by
the
use
of
a
few
plain
mouldings
fixed
to
the
plaster
the
whole
being
painted
in
one
uniform
tint
or
in
two
contrasting
colors
such
as
white
for
the
mouldings
and
buff
gray
or
pale
green
for
the
wall
to
this
scheme
may
be
added
plaster
medallions
as
suggested
for
the
vestibule
or
garlands
and
other
architectural
motives
made
of
staff
in
imitation
of
the
stucco
ornaments
of
the
old
french
and
italian
decorators
when
such
ornaments
are
used
they
should
invariably
be
simple
and
strong
in
design
the
modern
decorator
is
too
often
tempted
by
mere
prettiness
of
detail
to
forget
the
general
effect
of
his
composition
in
a
staircase
where
only
the
general
effect
is
seized
prettiness
does
not
count
and
the
effect
produced
should
be
strong
clear
and
telling
for
the
same
reason
a
if
used
should
be
of
one
color
without
pattern
masses
of
plain
color
are
one
of
the
chief
means
of
producing
effect
in
any
scheme
of
decoration
when
the
floor
of
the
hall
is
of
marble
or
mosaic
as
if
possible
it
should
be
the
design
like
that
of
the
walls
should
be
clear
and
decided
in
outline
see
plate
xxx
on
the
other
hand
if
the
hall
is
used
as
an
antechamber
and
carpeted
the
carpet
should
be
of
one
color
matching
that
on
the
stairs
in
many
large
houses
the
stairs
are
now
built
of
stone
or
marble
while
the
floor
of
the
landings
is
laid
in
wood
apparently
owing
to
the
idea
that
stone
or
marble
floors
are
cold
in
the
american
house
not
even
the
most
sensitive
person
could
be
chilled
by
passing
contact
with
a
stone
floor
but
if
it
is
thought
to
look
cold
it
is
better
to
lay
a
rug
or
a
strip
of
carpet
on
the
landing
than
to
permit
the
proximity
of
two
such
different
substances
as
wood
and
stone
unless
the
stairs
are
of
wood
that
material
should
never
be
used
for
the
rail
nor
should
wooden
stairs
be
put
in
a
staircase
of
which
the
walls
are
of
stone
marble
or
scagliola
if
the
stairs
are
of
wood
it
is
better
to
treat
the
walls
with
wood
or
plaster
panelling
in
simple
staircases
the
best
is
a
wooden
nailed
on
the
plaster
the
dado
thus
formed
being
painted
white
and
the
wall
above
it
in
any
uniform
color
continuous
pattern
such
as
that
on
paper
or
stuff
hangings
is
specially
objectionable
on
the
walls
of
a
staircase
since
it
disturbs
the
simplicity
of
composition
best
fitted
to
this
part
of
the
house
for
the
lighting
of
the
hall
there
should
be
a
lantern
like
that
in
the
vestibule
but
more
elaborate
in
design
this
mode
of
lighting
harmonizes
with
the
severe
treatment
of
the
walls
and
indicates
at
once
that
the
hall
is
not
a
but
a
thoroughfare
if
lights
be
required
on
the
stairs
they
should
take
the
form
of
bronze
sconces
as
architectural
as
possible
in
design
without
any
finikin
prettiness
of
detail
for
good
examples
see
the
in
plates
v
and
xxxiv
it
is
almost
impossible
to
obtain
of
this
kind
in
america
but
the
increasing
interest
shown
in
will
in
time
doubtless
cause
a
demand
for
a
better
type
of
gas
and
electric
fixtures
meantime
unless
imported
sconces
can
be
obtained
the
plainest
brass
fixtures
should
be
chosen
in
preference
to
the
more
elaborate
models
now
to
be
found
here
where
the
walls
of
a
hall
are
hung
with
pictures
these
should
be
few
in
number
and
decorative
in
composition
and
coloring
no
subject
requiring
thought
and
study
is
suitable
in
such
a
position
the
mythological
or
architectural
compositions
of
the
italian
and
french
schools
of
the
last
two
centuries
with
their
superficial
graces
of
color
and
design
are
for
this
reason
well
suited
to
the
walls
of
halls
and
antechambers
the
same
may
be
said
of
prints
these
should
not
be
used
in
a
large
hall
but
they
look
well
in
a
small
entranceway
if
hung
on
walls
here
again
such
architectural
compositions
as
piranesi
with
their
bold
contrasts
of
light
and
shade
marc
antonio
classic
designs
or
some
procession
such
as
mantegna
triumph
of
julius
caesar
are
especially
appropriate
whereas
the
subtle
detail
of
the
german
little
masters
the
symbolism
of
dürer
etchings
and
the
graces
of
marillier
or
moreau
le
jeune
would
be
wasted
in
a
situation
where
there
is
small
opportunity
for
more
than
a
passing
glance
in
most
american
houses
the
warming
of
hall
and
stairs
is
so
amply
provided
for
that
where
there
is
a
hall
fireplace
it
is
seldom
used
in
country
houses
where
it
is
sometimes
necessary
to
have
special
means
for
heating
the
hall
the
open
fireplace
is
of
more
service
but
it
is
not
really
suited
to
such
a
situation
the
hearth
suggests
an
idea
of
intimacy
and
repose
that
has
no
place
in
a
thoroughfare
like
the
hall
and
aside
from
this
question
of
fitness
there
is
a
practical
objection
to
placing
an
open
in
a
position
where
it
is
exposed
to
continual
draughts
from
the
front
door
and
from
the
rooms
giving
upon
the
hall
the
best
way
of
heating
a
hall
is
by
means
of
a
faience
stove
not
the
oblong
block
composed
of
shiny
white
or
brown
tiles
seen
in
swiss
and
german
but
one
of
the
fine
old
stoves
of
architectural
design
still
used
on
the
continent
for
heating
the
vestibule
and
in
europe
increased
attention
has
of
late
been
given
to
the
design
and
coloring
of
these
stoves
and
if
better
known
here
they
would
form
an
important
feature
in
the
decoration
of
our
halls
admirable
models
may
be
studied
in
many
old
french
and
german
houses

period
the

nobleman
life
was
enacted
in

while
the
social

side
of
existence
was
transferred
to

this
was
soon
divided
into
two
rooms
as
in
england
in

however
both
these
rooms
contained
beds

in

which
was
used
not
only
for

for
informal

of

in
small
houses
the

slept
in
the
room
which
served
as
her
boudoir
and
the
renaissance

is
true
had
introduced
from
italy
the
opening
off
the

chamber
as
in
the
palaces
of
urbino
and
mantua
but
these
rooms
were
at
first
seen
only
in
palaces
and
were
moreover
too
small
to
serve
any
social
purpose
the
of

a
characteristic
example
meanwhile
the

had
relieved
the
of

of

apartments

to
have
satisfied
all
the
requirements
of
society

the

of

to
show
that
it
is
the
result
of
two
distinct
influences
that
of
the
gala
apartment
and
that
of
the
family
this
twofold
origin
has
curiously
affected

development
of

there
are

it
is
obvious
that
the
latter
ought
to
be
used
as
a

for
the
whole
family
and
it
is
usually
regarded
as
such
in

common
sense
generally
prevails
in
matters
of
material
comfort
and
convenience
and
where

would
astonish
those
who
associate
the

uncomfortable
furniture

houses

traditional
influences
are
seen
sometimes
as

as
a

discomfort
the

and
the
convenience
of
all
its
inmates
being
sacrificed
to
a
vague
feeling
that
no
is
worthy
of
the
name
unless
it
is
uninhabitable
this
is
an
instance
of
the
de
having
usurped
the
rightful
place
of
the
de
or
rather
if
the
bourgeois
descent
of
the
american
house
be
considered
it
may
be
more
truly
defined
as
a
remnant
of
the
best
parlor
superstition
whatever
the
genealogy
of
the
american
it
must
be
owned
that
it
too
often
fails
to
fulfil
its
purpose
as
a
family
apartment

is
curious
to
note
the
amount
of
thought
and
money
frequently
spent
on
the
one

in
the

by
no

to
vulgarize

electric
light

its

which
no
expedients

yet
overcome
has
taken
from
our
all
air
of
privacy
and
distinction
in
passageways
and
offices
electricity
is
of
great
service
but
were
it
not
that
all
modern
improvements
are
thought
equally
applicable
to
every
condition
of
life
it
would
be
difficult
to
account
for
the
adoption
of

mode
of

a
general
impression
that

owing

fact
that
the

is
based
on
the
appointments
of
gala
rooms
in

visitors

much
of
the
old

which
appears
to
us
unnecessarily
stiff
and
monumental

expressly
designed
to

rooms
used

european
architects
have
always
considered
it
essential
that
those
rooms
which
are
used
exclusively
for
entertaining
gala
rooms
as
they
are
called
should
be
quite
separate
from
the
family
apartments
either
occupying
an
entire
floor
the
italian
or
being
so
situated
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
open
them
except
for
general
entertainments
in
many
large
houses
lately
built
in
america
with
ball
and
music
rooms
and
a
hall
simulating
the
italian
saloon
this
distinction
has
been
disregarded
and
living
and
gala
rooms
have
been
confounded
in
an
agglomeration
of
apartments
where
the
family
for
lack
of
a
smaller
suite
sit
under
gilded
ceilings
and
chandeliers
in
about
as
much
comfort
and
privacy
as
are
afforded
by
the
public
parlors
of
one
of
our
new
hotels
this
confusion
of
two
essentially
different
types
of
room
designed
for
essentially
different
phases
of
life
has
been
caused
by
the
fact
that
the
architect
when
called
upon
to
build
a
grand
house
has
simply
enlarged
instead
of
altering
the
that
has
hitherto
been
the
accepted
model
of
the
american
gentleman
house
for
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
the
modern
american
dwelling
descends
from
the
english
house
not
from
the
aristocratic
or
town
residence
the
english
town
house
was
like
the
french
with
gates
porter
lodge
and
surrounded
by
stables
and
offices
and
the
planning
of
the
was
even
more
elaborate
a
glance
at
any
collection
of
old
english
such
as
campbell
will
show
the
purely
ancestry
of
the
american
house
and
the
consequent
futility
of
attempting
by
the
mere
enlargement
of
each
room
to
turn
it
into
a
gentleman
seat
or
town
residence
the
kind
of
life
which
makes
gala
rooms
necessary
exacts
a
different
method
of
planning
and
until
this
is
more
generally
understood
the
treatment
of
such
rooms
in
american
houses
will
never
be
altogether
satisfactory
gala
rooms
are
meant
for
general
entertainments
never
for
any
assemblage
small
or
informal
enough
to
be
conveniently
accommodated
in
the
ordinary
of
the
house
therefore
to
fulfil
their
purpose
they
must
be
large
very
and
not
overcrowded
with
furniture
while
the
walls
and
ceiling
the
only
parts
of
a
crowded
room
that
can
be
seen
must
be
decorated
with
greater
elaboration
than
would
be
pleasing
or
appropriate
in
other
rooms
all
these
conditions
unfit
the
gala
room
for
any
use
save
that
for
which
it
is
designed
nothing
can
be
more
cheerless
than
the
state
of
a
handful
of
people
sitting
after
dinner
in
an
immense
with
gilded
ceiling
bare
floors
and
a
few
pieces
of
monumental
furniture
ranged
round
the
walls
yet
in
any
house
which
is
simply
an
enlargement
of
the
ordinary
private
dwelling
the
hostess
is
often
compelled
to
use
the
or
saloon

a
a
gala

never
meant
to
be

when
crowded
the
crowd

the
place
of
furniture
occupied
by
a
small
number
of
people
such
a
room
looks
out
of
proportion
stiff
and
empty
the
hostess
feels
this
and
tries
by
setting
chairs
and
tables
askew
and
introducing
palms
screens
and
to
produce
an
effect
of
informality
as
a
result
the
room
dwarfs
the
furniture
loses
the
air
of
state
and
gains
little
in
real
comfort
while
it
becomes
necessary
when
a
party
is
given
to
remove
the
furniture
and
disarrange
the
house
thus
undoing
the
chief
of
such
apartments
the
italians
inheriting
the
grandiose
traditions
of
the
augustan
age

always
excelled
in

treatment

grand
manner
their
unfailing
sense
that
is
interior
architecture
and
must
clearly
proclaim
its
architectural
affiliations
has
been
of
special
service
in
this
respect
it
is
rare
in
italy
to
see
a
large
room
inadequately
treated
sometimes
the
grand
manner
the
mimic
may
be
carried
too
far
to
suit
taste
it
is
hard
to
say
for
what
form
of
entertainment
such
a
room
as
giulio
romano
sala

in
the
palazzo
del
t
would
form
a
pleasing
or
appropriate
background
but
apart
from
such
occasional
aberrations
the
italian
decorators
showed
a
wonderful
sense
of
fitness
in
the
treatment
of
state
apartments
to
small
dribbles
of
ornament
they
preferred
bold
forcible
mouldings
coarse
but
ornamentation

has
already
been

in

it
was
a
apartment
usually
with

and
a
gallery
to
which
access
was
obtained
by
concealed
staircases
see
plates
xlii
and
xliii
this
gallery
was
often
treated
as
an
arcade
or
loggia
and
in
many
old
italian
prints
and
pictures
there
are
representations
of
these
saloons
with
groups
of
gaily
dressed
people
looking
down
from
the
gallery
upon
the
throngs
crowding
the
floor
the
saloon
was
used
in
italy
as
a
or
gaming
being
the
chief
social
amusement
of
the
eighteenth
century
in
england
and
france
the
saloon
was
rarely
two
stories
high
though
there
are
some
exceptions
as
for
example
the
saloon
at
the
cooler
climate
rendered
a
clerestory
less
necessary
and
there
was
never
the
same
passion
for
grandiose
effects
as
in
italy
the
saloon
in
northern
europe
was
always
a
stately
and
room
generally
vaulted
or
domed
and
often
circular
in
plan
but
it
seldom
reached
such
imposing
dimensions
as
its
italian
prototype
and
when
more
than
one
story
high
was
known
by
the
distinctive
designation
of
salon
à
the
gallery
was
probably
the
first
feature
in
domestic
to
be
borrowed
from
italy
by
northern
europe
it
is
seen
in
almost
all
the
early
renaissance
châteaux
of
france
and
as
soon
as
the
influence
of
such
men
as
john
of
padua
and
john
shute
asserted
itself
in
england
the
gallery
became
one
of
the
principal
apartments
of
the
elizabethan
mansion
there
are
several
reasons
for
the
popularity
of
the
gallery
in
the
cold
rainy
autumns
and
winters
north
of
the
alps
it
was
invaluable
as
a
sheltered
place
for
exercise
and
games
it
was
well
adapted
to
display
the
pictures
statuary
and
which
in
emulation
of
italian
collectors
the
northern
nobles
were
beginning
to
acquire
and
it
showed
off
to
advantage
the
long
line
of
ancestral
portraits
and
the
tapestries
representing
a
succession
of
episodes
from
the
the
or
some
of
the
interminable
epics
that
formed
the
light
reading
of
the
sixteenth
century
then
too
the
gallery
served
for
the
processions
which
were
a
part
of
the
social
ceremonial
in
great
houses
the
march
to
the
chapel
or
the
escorting
of
a
royal
guest
to
the
state
bedroom
and
other
like
pageants
in
france
and
england
the
gallery
seems
for
a
long
time
to
have
been
used
as
a
saloon
and
whereas
in
italy
it
was
as
a
rule
reserved
for
the
display
of
the
of
the
house

a
need
not
be
a
gala
room
in
the
sense
of
being
used
only
for
large
entertainments
but
since
it
is
outside
the
circle
of
use
and
more
or
less
associated
with
entertaining
it
seems
best
to
include
it
in
this
chapter
many
houses
of
average
size
have
a
room
large
enough
for
informal
entertainments
such
a
room
especially
in
country
houses
should
be
decorated
in
a
gay
simple
manner
in
harmony
with
the
rest
of
the
house

with

is

from

the
avoidance
of
all

the
treatment
chosen
for

must
of
course
depend
on
its
size
and
its
relation
to
the
other
rooms
in
the
house

a

be
more
subdued
in
color
than
a
sombre

and
heavy

at

be
one
of
lightness
and
serenity

small

should
always
appear
as
though
there
were
space
overhead
for
the
notes
to
escape
and
some
form
of
vaulting
or
doming
is
therefore
more
suitable
than
a
flat
ceiling

well
designed

where

consequently
subjected
to

be
combined
with
variety

as

began
to
buy
books
for
the
sake
of
what
they
contained
less
exaggerated
importance
was
attached
to
their
exterior
so
that
bindings

perfect
as
taste

skill
could
make
them
were
seldom
as
extravagantly
enriched
as
in
the
two

remained

always
preferred

into

is
a
waste

rather
a
misapplication

always
a
sin
against
æsthetic
principles
the
importance
of
bookbindings
as
an
element
in

touched
upon

taste
for
good
bindings
has
come
to

as
a
collector
fad
like
accumulating
or
it
seems
needful
to
point
out
how
obvious
and
valuable
a
means
of
decoration
is
lost
by
disregarding
the
outward
appearance
of
books
to
be
decorative
a
bookcase
need
not
contain
the
productions
of
the
old
volumes
by
eve
and
derôme

are

the
question
of
binding
leads
incidentally
to
that
of
editions
though
the
latter
is
hardly
within
the
scope
of
this
book
people
who
have
begun
to
notice
the
outside
of
their
books
naturally
come
to
appreciate
paper
and
type
and
thus
learn
that
the
modern
book
is
too
often
merely
the
cheapest
possible
vehicle
for
putting
words
into
print
the
last
few
years
have
brought
about
some
improvement
and
it
is
now
not
unusual
for
a
publisher
in
bringing
out
a
book
at
the
ordinary
rates
to
produce
also
a
small
edition
in
copies
these
books
though
as
yet
far
from
perfect
in
type
and
are
superior
to
the
average
commercial
article
and
apart
from
their
artistic
merit
are
in
themselves
a
good
investment
since
the
value
of
such
editions
increases
steadily
year
by
year
those
who
can
not
afford
both
edition
and
binding
will
do
better
to
buy
books
or
current
first
editions
in
boards
than
handsomely
bound
volumes
unworthy
in
type
and
paper
the
plain
paper
or
buckram
covers
of
a
good
publisher
are
in
fact
more
decorative
because
more
artistic
than
showy
or
antique
morocco
the
same
principle
applies
to
the
library
itself
plain
shelves
filled
with
good
editions
in
good
bindings
are
more
truly
decorative
than
ornate
bookcases
lined
with
tawdry
books
it
has
already
been
pointed
out
that
the
plan
of
building
into
the
walls
is
the
most
decorative
and
the
most
practical
see
plate
xlviii
the
best
examples
of
this
treatment
are
found
in
france
the
walls
of
the
rooms
thus
decorated
were
usually
of
panelled
wood
either
in
natural
oak
or
walnut
as
in
the

of
the

university
at
nancy
or
else
painted
in
two
contrasting
colors
such
as
gray
and
white

not
set
in

shelves
formed

lining

in

the
bookcases

organic
part
of
the
any
study
of
old
french
works

furniture
will
show
how
seldom
the
detached
bookcase
was
used
in
french
libraries
but
few
models
are
to
be
found
and
these
were
probably
designed
for
use
in
the
boudoir

study
rather
than
in
the

were

extensive
the
movable
bookcase
was
much
used

of

proportionately
rarer

of
the
old

innumerable
models
of

bookcases

with
panes
in
wooden
mouldings
and
the
familiar
broken
pediment
surmounted
by
a
bust
or

urn

was
natural
that
where
books
were
few
small
bookcases
should
be
preferred
to
a
room
lined
with
shelves
and
in
the
seventeenth
century
according
to
john
evelyn
the
three
nations
of
great
britain
contained
fewer
books
than
paris
almost
all
the
old
bookcases
had
one
feature
in
common
that
is
the
lower
cupboard
with
solid
doors
the
bookcase
proper
rested
upon
this
projecting
cupboard
thus
raising
the
books
above
the
level
of
the
furniture
the
prevalent
fashion
of
low
starting
from
the
floor
and
not
extending
much
higher
than
the
has
probably
been
brought
about
by
the
other
recent
fashion
of
rooms
architects
are
beginning
to
rediscover
the
forgotten
fact
that
the
stud
of
a
room
should
be
regulated
by
the
dimensions
of
its
so
that
in
the
newer
houses
the
dwarf
bookcase
is
no
longer
a
necessity
it
is
certainly
less
convenient
than
the
tall
press
for
not
only
must
one
kneel
to
reach
the
lower
shelves
but
the
books
are
hidden
and
access
to
them
is
obstructed
by
their
being
on
a
level
with
the
furniture
the
general
decoration
of
the
library
should
be
of
such
character
as
to
form
a
background
or
setting
to
the
books
rather
than
to
distract
attention
from
them
the
richly
adorned
room
in
which
books
are
but
a
minor
incident
is
in
fact
no
library
at
all
there
is
no
reason
why
the
decorations
of
a
library
should
not
be
splendid
but
in
that
case
the
books
must
be
splendid
too
and
sufficient
in
number
to
dominate
all
the
accessory
decorations
of
the
room
when
there
are
books
enough
it
is
best
to
use
them
as
part
of
the
decorative
treatment
of
the
walls
panelling
any
intervening
spaces
in
a
severe
and
dignified
style
otherwise
movable
bookcases
may
be
placed
against
the
more
important
the
walls
being
decorated
with
wooden
panelling
or
with
mouldings
and
stucco
ornaments
but
in
this
case
composition
and
must
be
so
subdued
as
to
throw
the
bookcases
and
their
contents
into
marked
relief
it
does
not
follow
that
because
books
are
the
chief
feature
of
the
library
other
ornaments
should
be
excluded
but
they
should
be
used
with
discrimination
and
so
chosen
as
to
harmonize
with
the
spirit
of
the
room
nowhere
is
the
modern
litter
of
and
photographs
more
inappropriate
than
in
the
library

be

and
clear
of
everything
but

and

the
term
but
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
the
next
generation
of
architects
will
have
wider
opportunities
in
this
direction
the
proper
with
its
en
of
turkish
divans
narghilehs
brass
and
other
oriental
properties
is
no
longer
considered
a
necessity
in
the
modern
house
and
the
room
which
would
formerly
have
been
used
for
this
special
purpose
now
comes
rather
under
the
head
of
the
master
or
den
since
the
latter
word
seems
to
have
attained
the
dignity
of
a
technical
term
whatever
extravagances
the
upholsterer
may
have
committed
in
other
parts
of
the
house
it
is
usually
conceded
that
common
sense
should
regulate
the
furnishing
of
the
den
fragile
chairs
and
irrelevant
are
consequently
excluded
and
the
master
sense
of
comfort
often
expresses
itself
in
a
set
of
office
furniture
a
desk
a
revolving
chair
and
others
of
the
puffy
type
already
described
as
the
accepted
model
of
a
luxurious
seat
thus
freed
from
the
superfluous
the
den
is
likely
to
be
the
most
comfortable
room
in
the
house
and
the
natural
inference
is
that
a
room
in
order
to
be
comfortable
must
be
ugly
one
can
picture
the
derision
of
the
man
who
is
told
that
he
might
without
the
smallest
sacrifice
of
comfort
or
convenience
transact
his
business
at
a
louis
xvi
seated
in
a
louis
xvi
chair
yet
the
handsomest
desks
of
the
last
century
the
fine
old
à
la
or
were
the
prototypes
of
the
modern
and
the
cane
or
with
rounded
back
and
five
slim
strong
legs
was
far
more
comfortable
than
the
amorphous
revolving
seat
convenience
was
not
sacrificed
to
beauty
in
either
desk
or
chair
but
both
the
old
pieces
being
designed
by
skilled
were
as
decorative
as
they
were
useful
there
seems
in
fact
no
reason
why
the
modern
den
should
not
resemble
the
financiers
seen
in
so
many
old
prints
rooms
of
dignified
plainness
but
where
each
line
of
and
furniture
was
as
carefully
studied
and
intelligently
adapted
to
its
ends
as
though
intended
for
a
or
boudoir
reference
has
been
made
to
the
way
in
which
even
in
small
houses
a
room
may
be
sacrificed
to
a
supposed
effect
or
to
some
inherited
tradition
as
to
its
former
use
thus
the
family
is
too
often
made
uninhabitable
from
some
vague
feeling
that
a
is
not
worthy
of
its
name
unless
too
fine
to
sit
in
while
the
small
front
room
on
the
ground
floor
in
the
average
american
house
the
only
corner
given
over
to
the
master
is
thrown
into
the
hall
either
that
the
house
may
appear
larger
and
handsomer
or
from
sheer
inability
to
make
so
small
a
room
habitable
there
is
no
reason
why
even
a
or
an
foot
room
should
not
be
made
comfortable
and
the
following
suggestions
are
intended
to
indicate
the
lines
on
which
an
appropriate
scheme
of
decoration
might
be
carried
out
in
most
town
houses
the
small
room
is
built
with
an
opening
in
the
longitudinal
wall
close
to
the
front
door
while
there
is
usually
another
entrance
at
the
back
of
the
room
facing
the
window
one
at
least
of
these
openings
being
as
a
rule
of
exaggerated
width
in
such
cases
the
door
in
the
side
of
the
room
should
be
walled
up
this
gives
privacy
and
provides
enough
additional
for
a
piece
of
furniture
the
best
way
of
obtaining
an
effect
of
size
is
to
panel
the
walls
by
means
of
architectural
mouldings
a
few
strong
vertical
lines
will
give
dignity
to
the
room
and
height
to
the
ceiling
the
walls
should
be
free
from
pattern
and
light
in
color
since
dark
walls
necessitate
much
artificial
light
and
have
the
disadvantage
of
making
a
room
look
small
the
ceiling
if
not
plain
must
be
ornamented
with
the
lightest
tracery
and
supported
by
a
cornice
correspondingly
simple
in
design
heavy
are
obviously
out
of
place
in
a
small
room
and
a
plain
expanse
of
plaster
is
always
preferable
to
misapplied
ornament
a
single
curtain
made
of
some
flexible
material
such
as
corduroy
or
thin
unlined
damask
and
so
hung
that
it
may
be
readily
drawn
back
during
the
day
is
sufficient

the

while
in
a
corner
near
this
window
may
be
placed

made

see
a

set
apart

people
continued
to
dine
in
the
antechamber
where
there
were
two
antechambers
the
inner
was
used
for
that
purpose

it
was
only
in
grand
houses

in
the
luxurious
establishments
of
the
that
were
to
be
found

act
of
dining
seems
to
have
been
taken
more
seriously

the

of
the

included
a
greater
variety
of
rooms

more
symmetrical
lines

we
find
rooms
designated
as

houses
in
fact
contained
two
or
three
each
with
a
different
exposure
so
that
they
might
be
used

different

these
rooms
can
hardly
be
said
to
represent
our
modern
since
they
were
not
planned
in
connection
with
kitchen
and
offices
and
were
probably
used
as
when
not
needed
for
dining

it
was
from
the
elizabethan
that
the
modern
really
developed

it

an
invention

a
panelled

the

were

unvarnished
oak

oftener
they
were
painted

obvious
form

appropriateness

after

a
part
of

little
remains
to
be
said

the
descriptions
already
given
of
the
various
gala
apartments
it
is
obvious
that
the
should
be
less
brilliant
than
a
and
less
fanciful
in
decoration
than
a
a
severer
and
more
restful
treatment
naturally
suggests
itself
but
beyond
this
no
special
indications
are
required
the
old
were
usually
heated
by
porcelain
stoves
such
a
stove
of
fine
architectural
design
set
in
a
niche
corresponding
with
that
which
contains
the
fountain
is
of
great
decorative
value
in
the
composition
of
the
room
and
as
it
has
the
advantage
of
giving
out
less
concentrated
heat
than
an
open
fire
it
is
specially
well
suited
to
a
small
or
narrow
where
some
of
the
guests
must
necessarily
sit
close
to
the
hearth

have
contain
also
a
smaller
apartment
called

as

corresponds

the

applicable

we
now
know

little
need
be
said
the
ingenious
but
ugly

a
central
support
now
used
all
over
the
world
is
an
english
invention
there
seems
no
reason
why
the
general
design
should
not
be
improved
without
interfering
with
the
mechanism
of
this
table
but
of
course
it
can
never
be
so
satisfactory
to
the
eye
as

the
old

the
history
of
the
bedroom
has
been
incidentally
touched
upon
in
tracing
the
development
of
the
from
the
mediæval
hall
it
was
shown
that
early
in
the
middle
ages
the
which
had
been
one
of
the
first
outgrowths
of
the
hall
was
divided
into
the
de
or
incipient
and
the
au
or
actual
the
increasing
development
of
social
life
in
the
sixteenth
century
brought
about
a
further
change
the
state
bedroom
being
set
aside
for
entertainments
of
ceremony
while
the
was
used
as
the
family
and
as
the
scene
of
suppers
and
informal
receptions
or
sometimes
actually
as
the
kitchen
indeed
so
varied
were
the
uses
to
which
the
au
was
put
that
in
france
especially
it
can
hardly
be
said
to
have
offered
a
refuge

bed
and

modern

as
a
rule
the
bedrooms
of
the
renaissance
and
of
the
seventeenth
century
were
very
richly
furnished
the
fashion
of
raising
the
bed
on
a
dais
separated
from
the
rest
of
the
room
by
columns
and
a
balustrade
was
introduced
in
france
in
the
time
of
louis
xiv
this
innovation
gave
rise
to
the
habit
of
dividing
the
decoration
of
the
room
into
two
parts
the
walls
being
usually
panelled
or
painted
while
the
alcove
as
it
was
called
was
hung
in
tapestry
velvet
or
some
rich
stuff
in
keeping
with
the
heavy
curtains
that
completely
enveloped
the
bedstead
this
use
of
stuff
hangings
about
the
bed
so
contrary
to
our
ideas
of
bedroom
hygiene
was
due
to
the
difficulty
of
heating
the
large
rooms
of
the
period
and
also
it
must
be
owned
to
the
prevalent
dread
of
fresh
air
as
of
something
essentially
unwholesome
and
pernicious
in
the
early
middle
ages
people
usually
slept
on
the
floor
though
it
would
seem
that
occasionally
to
avoid
cold
or
dampness
the
mattress
was
laid
on
cords
stretched
upon
a
low
wooden
framework
in
the
fourteenth
century
the
use
of
such
frameworks
became
more
general
and
the
bed
was
often
enclosed
in
curtains
hung
from
a
tester
resting
on
four
posts
and
coverlet
were
often
magnificently
embroidered
but
in
order
that
it
might
not
be
necessary
to
transport
from
place
to
place
the
unwieldy
bedstead
and
tester
these
were
made
in
the
rudest
manner
without
attempt
at
carving
or
adornment
in
course
of
time
this
primitive
framework
developed
into
the
sumptuous
bedstead
of
the
renaissance
with
elaborately
carved
cornice
and
enriched
with
gilding
thenceforward
more
wealth
and
skill
were
expended
upon
the
bedstead
than
upon
any
other
article
of
furniture
gilding
carving
and
inlaying
of
silver
ivory
or
combined
to
adorn
the
framework
and
embroidery
made
the
coverlet
and
hangings
resplendent
as
church
vestments
this
magnificence
is
explained
by
the
fact
that
it
was
customary
for
the
lady
of
the
house
to
lie
in
bed
while
receiving
company
in
many
old
prints
representing
suppers
or
afternoon
visits
the
hostess
is
thus
seen
with
elaborately
dressed
head
and
stiff
brocade
gown
while
her
friends
are
grouped
about
the
bedside
in
equally
rich
attire
this
curious
custom
persisted
until
late
in
the
eighteenth
century
and
under
such
conditions
it
was
natural
that
the
old
should
vie
with
each
other
in
producing
a
variety
of
ornate
and
fanciful
bedsteads
it
would
be
useless
to
enumerate
here
the
modifications
in
design
marking
the
different
periods
of
decoration
those
who
are
interested
in
the
subject
will
find
it
treated
in
detail
in
the
various
french
works
on
furniture
it
was
natural
that
while
the
bedroom
was
used
as
a
it
should
be
decorated
with
more
elaboration
than
would
otherwise
have
been
fitting
but
two
causes
combined
to
simplify
its
treatment
in
the
eighteenth
century
one
of
these
was
the
new
fashion
of
with
artists
so
keenly
alive
to
proportion
as
the
old
french
designers
it
was
inevitable
that
such
a
change
in
dimensions
should
bring
about
a
corresponding
change
in
decoration
the
bedrooms
of
the
eighteenth
century
though
sometimes
elaborate
in
detail
had
none
of
the
pompous
richness
of
the
great
renaissance
or
louis
xiv
room

the
pretentious

with
its
screen

replaced
by

containing
the

plain
succeeded
to
tapestry
and
embroidered
hangings
and
the
heavy
carved
ceiling
with
its
mythological
made
way
for
light
traceries
on
plaster
the
other
change
in
the
decoration
of
french
bedrooms
was
due
to
the
substitution
of
linen
or
cotton
bed
and
for
the
sumptuous
velvets
and
brocades
of
the
seventeenth
century
this
change
has
usually
been
ascribed
to
the
importation
of
linens
and
cottons
from
the
east
and
no
doubt
the
novelty
of
these
gay
stimulated
the
taste
for
simple
hangings
the
old
inventories
however
show
that
in
addition
to
the
imported
india
hangings
plain
white
linen
curtains
with
a
colored
border
were
much
used
and
it
is
probably
the
change
in
the
size
of
rooms
that
first
led
to
the
adoption
of
thin
washable
hangings
the
curtains
and
of
damask
or
brocatelle
so
well
suited
to
the
rooms
of
the
seventeenth
century
would
have
been
out
of
place
in
the
small
apartments
of
the
regency
in
studying
the
history
of
decoration
it
will
generally
be
found
that
the
supposed
vagaries
of
were
actually
based
on
some
practical
requirement
and
in
this
instance
the
old
decorators
were
doubtless
guided
rather
by
common
sense
than
by
caprice
the
adoption
of
these
washable
materials
certainly
introduced
a
style
of
answering
to
all
the
requirements
of
recent
hygiene
for
not
only
were
windows
and
bedsteads
hung
with
unlined
cotton
or
linen
but
chairs
and
sofas
were
covered
with
removable
or
while
the
painted
and
bare
brick
or
parquet
floors
came
far
nearer
to
the
modern
sanitary
ideal
than
do
the
papered
walls
and
carpets
still
seen
in
many
bedrooms
this
simple
form
of
decoration
had
the
additional
charm
of
variety
for
it
was
not
unusual
to
have
several
complete
sets
of
curtains
and
embroidered
to
match
and
changed
with
the
seasons
the
hangings
and
covers
of
the
queen
bedroom
at
versailles
were
changed
four
times
a
year
although
bedrooms
are
still
done
in
chintz
and
though
of
late
especially
there
has
been
a
reaction
from
the
bedroom
with
its
upholstery
and
the
modern
habit
of
lining
chintz
curtains
and
of
tufting
chairs
has
done
away
with
the
chief
advantages
of
the
simpler
style
of
treatment
there
is
something
illogical
in
using
washable
stuffs
in
such
a
way
that
they
can
not
be
washed
especially
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
heavily
lined
curtains
which
might
be
useful
to
exclude
light
and
cold
are
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
so
hung
by
the
upholsterer
that
they
can
not
possibly
be
drawn
at
night
besides
the
patterns
of
modern
chintzes
have
so
little
in
common
with
the
of
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
that
they
scarcely
serve
the
same
decorative
purpose
and
it
is
therefore
needful
to
give
some
account
of
the
old
french
bedroom
hangings
as
well
as
of
the
manner
in
which
they
were
employed
the
liking
for
showed
itself
in
france
early
in
the
seventeenth
century
before
this
cotton
materials
had
been
imported
from
the
east
but
in
the
seventeenth
century
a
manufactory
was
established
in
france
and
until
about
cotton
and
linen
curtains
and
remained
in
fashion
this
taste
was
encouraged
by
the
importation
of
the
des
printed
cottons
of
gay
color
and
fanciful
design
much
sought
after
in
france
especially
after
the
government
in
order
to
protect
native
industry
had
restricted
the
privilege
of
importing
them
to
the
des
it
was
not
until
oberkampf
established
his
manufactory
at
jouy
in
that
the
french
began
to
replace
those
of
foreign
manufacture
hitherto
the
cottons
made
in
france
had
been
stamped
merely
in
outline
the
colors
being
filled
in
by
hand
but
oberkampf
invented
a
method
of
printing
in
colors
thereby
making
france
the
leading
market
for
such
stuffs
the
earliest
printed
cottons
having
been
imported
from
india
and
china
it
was
natural
that
the
style
of
the
oriental
designers
should
influence
their
european
imitators
europe
had
in
fact
been
prompt
to
recognize
the
singular
beauty
of
chinese
art
and
in
france
the
passion
for
first
aroused
by
mazarin
collection
of
oriental
objects
of
art
continued
unabated
until
the
general
decline
of
taste
at
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
nowhere
perhaps
was
the
influence
of
chinese
art
more
beneficial
to
european
designers
than
in
the
composition
of
the
fantastic
gaiety
and
variety
of
chinese
designs
in
which
the
human
figure
so
largely
predominates
gave
fresh
animation
to
european
compositions
while
the
absence
of
perspective
and
modelling
preserved
that
conventionalism
so
essential
in
the
voluminous
the
arabesques
and
massive
so
suitable
to
the
genoese
velvets
and
lyons
silks
of
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
would
have
been
far
too
magnificent
for
the
cotton
stuffs
that
were
beginning
to
replace
those
splendid
tissues
on
a
thin
material
a
heavy
architectural
pattern
was
obviously
inappropriate
besides
it
would
have
been
out
of
scale
with
the
smaller
rooms
and
lighter
style
of
decoration
then
coming
into
fashion
the
french
designer
while
influenced
by
chinese
compositions
was
too
artistic
to
be
satisfied
with
literal
reproductions
of
his
oriental
models
absorbing
the
spirit
of
the
chinese
designs
he
either
blent
mandarins
and
pagodas
with
italian
grottoes
french
landscapes
and
classical
masks
and
trophies
in
one
of
those
delightful
inventions
which
are
the
of
decorative
art
or
applied
the
principles
of
oriental
design
to
purely
european
subjects
in
comparing
the
printed
cottons
of
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
with
modern
chintzes
it
will
be
seen
that
the
latter
are
either
covered
with
monotonous
repetitions
of
a
geometrical
figure
or
with
realistic
reproductions
of
some
natural
object
many
and
chintzes
of
the
present
day
represent
loose
branches
of
flowers
scattered
on
a
plain
surface
with
no
more
relation
to
each
other
or
to
their
background
than
so
many
real
flowers
fixed
at
random
against
the
wall
this
literal
rendering
of
natural
objects
with
deceptive
accuracy
always
condemned
by
the
best
artists
is
especially
inappropriate
when
brought
in
close
contact
with
the
highly
conventionalized
forms
of
architectural
composition
in
this
respect
the
endlessly
repeated
geometrical
figure
is
obviously
less
objectionable
yet
the
geometrical
design
as
produced
has
one
defect
in
common
with
the
other
that
is
lack
of
imagination
modern
draughtsmen
in
eliminating
from
their
work
that
fanciful
element
always
strictly
subordinated
to
some
general
scheme
of
composition
which
marked
the
designs
of
the
last
two
centuries
have
deprived
themselves
of
the
individuality
and
freshness
that
might
have
saved
their
patterns
from
monotony
this
rejection
of
the
fanciful
in
composition
is
probably
due
to
the
excessive
use
of
pattern
in
modern
decoration
where
much
pattern
is
used
it
must
be
as
monotonous
as
possible
or
it
will
become
unbearable
the
old
decorators
used
few
lines
and
permitted
themselves
more
freedom
in
design
or
rather
they
remembered
what
is
now
too
often
forgotten
that
in
the
decoration
of
a
room
furniture
and
objects
of
art
help
to
make
design
and
in
consequence
they
were
chiefly
concerned
with
providing
plain
spaces
of
background
to
throw
into
relief
the
contents
of
the
room
of
late
there
has
been
so
marked
a
return
to
plain
panelled
or
painted
walls
that
the
will
soon
be
encouraged
to
give
freer
rein
to
his
fancy
in
a
room
where
walls
and
floor
are
of
uniform
tint
there
is
no
reason
why
the
design
of
curtains
and
should
consist
of
long
straight
rows
of
buttercups
or
crocuses
endlessly
repeated

it
must
not
be
thought
that
the
old
designs
were
unconventional
nature
in
passing
through
the
medium
of
the
imagination
is
necessarily
transposed
and
in
a
manner
conventionalized
and
it
is
this
transposition
this
deliberate
selection
of
certain
characteristics
to
the
exclusion
of
others
that
distinguishes
the
work
of
art
from
a
cast
or
a
photograph
but
the
reduction
of
natural
objects
to
geometrical
forms
is
only
one
of
the
results
of
artistic
selection
the
italian
the
recognized
masters
of
in
the
flat
always
used
the
naturalistic
method
but
subject
to
certain
restrictions
in
composition
or
color
this
applies
also
to
the
chinese
designers
and
to
the
humbler
european
who
on
more
modest
lines
followed
the
same
sound
artistic
traditions
in
studying
the
manufactured
in
europe
previous
to
the
present
century
it
will
be
seen
that
where
the
design
included
the
human
figure
or
landscape
naturalistically
treated
as
in
the
fables
of
æsop
and
la
fontaine
or
the
history
of
don
quixote
the
pattern
was
either
printed
entirely
in
one
color
or
so
fantastically
colored
that
by
no
possibility
could
it
pass
for
an
attempt
at
a
literal
rendering
of
nature
besides
in
all
such
compositions
and
here
the
chinese
influence
is
seen
perspective
was
studiously
avoided
and
the
little
superimposed
groups
or
scenes
were
either
connected
by
some
decorative
arabesque
or
so
designed
that
by
their
outline
they
formed
a
recurring
pattern
on
the
other
hand
when
the
design
was
obviously
conventional
a
variety
of
colors
was
freely
used
the
introduction
of
the
human
figure
animals
architecture
and
landscape
into
undoubtedly
gave
to
the
old
designs
an
animation
lacking
in
those
of
the
present
day
and
a
return
to
the
of
the
chinese
artist
would
be
a
gain
to
modern
decoration
of
the
various
ways
in
which
a
bedroom
may
be
planned
none
is
so
luxurious
and
practical
as
the
french
method
of
subdividing
it
into
a
suite
composed
of
two
or
more
small
rooms
where
space
is
not
restricted
there
should
in
fact
be
four
rooms
preceded
by
an
antechamber
separating
the
suite
from
the
main
corridor
of
the
house
the
small
or
boudoir
opens
into
this
antechamber
and
next
comes
the
bedroom
beyond
which
are
the
dressing
and
bath
rooms
in
french
suites
of
this
kind
there
are
usually
but
two
means
of
entrance
from
the
main
corridor
one
for
the
use
of
the
occupant
leading
into
the
antechamber
the
other
opening
into
the
to
give
access
to
the
servants
this
arrangement
besides
giving
greater
privacy
preserves
much
valuable
which
would
be
sacrificed
in
america
to
the
supposed
necessity
of
making
every
room
in
a
house
open
upon
one
of
the
main
passageways
the
plan
of
the
bedroom
suite
can
of
course
be
carried
out
only
in
large
houses
but
even
where
there
is
no
lack
of
space
such
an
arrangement
is
seldom
adopted
by
american
architects
and
most
of
the
more
important
houses
recently
built
contain
immense
bedrooms
instead
of
a
series
of
suites
to
enumerate
the
practical
advantages
of
the
suite
over
the
single
large
room
hardly
comes
within
the
scope
of
this
book
but
as
the
uses
to
which
a
bedroom
is
put
fall
into
certain
natural
subdivisions
it
will
be
more
convenient
to
consider
it
as
a
suite
since
bedrooms
are
no
longer
used
as
there
is
no
reason
for
decorating
them
in
an
elaborate
manner
and
however
magnificent
the
other
apartments
it
is
evident
that
in
this
part
of
the
house
simplicity
is
most
fitting
now
that
people
have
been
taught
the
unhealthiness
of
sleeping
in
a
room
with
stuff
hangings
heavy
and
tufted
furniture
the
old
fashion
of
painted
walls
and
bare
floors
naturally
commends
itself
and
as
the
bedroom
suite
is
but
the
subdivision
of
one
large
room
it
is
obviously
better
that
the
same
style
of
decoration
should
be
used
throughout
for
this
reason
plain
panelled
walls
and
chintz
or
cotton
hangings
are
more
appropriate
to

the

are
without

a
figured
chintz
may
be
chosen
for
curtains
and
furniture

those
who
prefer
plain
tints
should
use
unbleached
cotton
trimmed
with
bands
of
color
or
some
colored
linen
with
applications
of
gimp
or
embroidery
it
is
a
good
plan
to
cover
all
the
chairs
and
sofas
in
the
bedroom
suite
with
slips
matching
the
but
where
this
is
done
the
furniture
should
if
possible
be
designed
for
the
purpose
since
the
lines
of
modern
upholstered
chairs
are
not
suited
to
slips
the
habit
of
designing
furniture
for
originated
in
the
middle
ages
at
a
time
when
the
necessity
of
transporting
furniture
was
added
to
the
other
difficulties
of
travel
it
was
usual
to
have
common
benches
and
tables
that
might
be
left
behind
without
risk
and
to
cover
these
with
richly
embroidered
slips
the
custom
persisted
long
after
furniture
had
ceased
to
be
a
part
of
luggage
and
the
benches
and
now
seen
in
many
european
palaces
are
covered
merely
with
embroidered
slips
even
when
a
set
of
furniture
was
upholstered
with
silk
it
was
usual
in
the
eighteenth
century
to
provide
embroidered
cotton
covers
for
use
in
summer
while
curtains
of
the
same
stuff
were
substituted
for
the
heavier
hangings
used
in
winter
old
inventories
frequently
mention
these
which
are
well
adapted
to
our
hot
summer
climate
the
boudoir
should
contain
a
a
lounge
or
de
and
one
or
two
comfortable
while
in
a
bedroom
forming
part
of
a
suite
only
the
bedstead
and
its
accessories
should
be
placed
the
pieces
of
furniture
needed
in
a
are
the
and
with
the
addition
if
space
permits
of
one
or
two
commodes
or
chiffonniers
the
designing
of
modern
furniture
of
this
kind
is
seldom
satisfactory
yet
many
who
are
careful
to
choose
simple
substantial
pieces
for
the
other
rooms
of
the
house
submit
to
the
pretentious
bedroom
suit
of
maple
or
mahogany
with
its
wearisome
irrelevance
of
line
and
its
excess
of
cheap
ornament
any
study
of
old
bedroom
furniture
will
make
clear
the
inferiority
of
the
modern
manufacturer
designs
nowhere
is
the
old
sense
of
proportion
and
fitness
seen
to
better
advantage
than
in
the
simple
admirably
composed
commodes
and
of
the
bedroom
the
walls
and
floor
should
of
course
be
in
the
average
a
tiled
floor
and
a
high
wainscoting
of
tiles
are
now
usually
seen
and
the
detached
enamel
or
porcelain
bath
has
in
most
cases
replaced
the
metal
tub
the
in
the
larger
houses
recently
built
are
in
general
lined
with
marble
but
though
the
use
of
this
substance
gives
opportunity
for
fine
architectural
effects
few
modern
can
in
this
respect
be
compared
with
those
seen
in
the
great
houses
of
europe
the
chief
fault
of
the
american
is
that
however
splendid
the
materials
used
the
treatment
is
seldom
architectural
a
glance
at
the
beautiful
in
the
pitti
palace
at
florence
see
plate
lv
will
show
how
much
effect
may
be
produced
in
a
small
space
by
carefully
studied
composition
a
mere
closet
is
here
transformed
into
a
stately
room
by
that
regard
for
harmony
of
parts
which
distinguishes
interior
architecture
from
mere
decoration
a
lined
with
precious
marbles
with
bath
and
ranged
along
the
wall
regardless
of
their
relation
to
the
composition
of
the
whole
is
no
better
architecturally
than
the
tiled
seen
in
ordinary
houses
design
not
substance
is
needed
to
make
the
one
superior
to
the
other
xv
the
and
nurseries
one
of
the
most
important
and
interesting
problems
in
the
planning
and
decoration
of
a
house
is
that
which
has
to
do
with
the
arrangement
of
the
children
rooms
there
is
of
course
little
opportunity
for
actual
decoration
in
or
nursery
and
it
is
only
by
stretching
a
point
that
a
book
dealing
merely
with
the
practical
application
of
æsthetics
may
be
made
to
include
a
chapter
bordering
on
pedagogy
it
must
be
remembered
however
that
any
application
of
principles
presupposes
some
acquaintance
with
the
principles
themselves
and
from
this
standpoint
there
is
a
certain
relevance
in
studying
the
means
by
which
the
child
surroundings
may
be
made
to
develop
his
sense
of
beauty
the
room
where
the
child
lessons
are
studied
is
in
more
senses
than
one
that
in
which
he
receives
his
education
his
whole
view
of
what
he
is
set
to
learn
and
of
the
necessity
and
advantage
of
learning
anything
at
all
is
tinged
more
often
than
people
think
by
the
appearance
of
the
room
in
which
his
studying
is
done
the
æsthetic
sensibilities
wake
early
in
some
children
and
these
if
able
to
analyze
their
emotions
could
testify
to
what
suffering
they
have
been
subjected
by
the
habit
of
sending
to
and
nurseries
whatever
furniture
is
too
ugly
or
threadbare
to
be
used
in
any
other
part
of
the
house
in
the
minds
of
such
children
curious
and
lasting
associations
are
early
established
between
the
appearance
of
certain
rooms
and
the
daily
occupations
connected
with
them
and
the
aspect
of
the
too
often
aggravates
instead
of
mitigating
the
weariness
of
there
are
of
course
many
children
not
naturally
sensitive
to
artistic
influences
and
the
parents
of
such
children
often
think
that
no
special
care
need
be
spent
on
their
surroundings
a
curious
misconception
of
the
purpose
of
all
æsthetic
training
to
teach
a
child
to
appreciate
any
form
of
beauty
is
to
develop
his
intelligence
and
thereby
to
enlarge
his
capacity
for
wholesome
enjoyment
it
is
therefore
never
idle
to
cultivate
a
child
taste
and
those
who
have
no
pronounced
natural
bent
toward
the
beautiful
in
any
form
need
more
guidance
and
encouragement
than
the
child
born
with
a
sense
of
beauty
the
latter
will
at
most
be
momentarily
offended
by
the
sight
of
ugly
objects
while
they
may
forever
blunt
the
taste
and
narrow
the
views
of
the
child
whose
sluggish
imagination
needs
the
constant
stimulus
of
beautiful
surroundings
if
art
is
really
a
factor
in
civilization
it
seems
obvious
that
the
feeling
for
beauty
needs
as
careful
cultivation
as
the
other
civic
virtues
to
teach
a
child
to
distinguish
between
a
good
and
a
bad
painting
a
well
or
an
statue
need
not
hinder
his
growth
in
other
directions
and
will
at
least
develop
those
habits
of
observation
and
comparison
that
are
the
base
of
all
sound
judgments
it
is
in
this
sense
that
the
study
of
art
is
of
service
to
those
who
have
no
special
aptitude
for
any
of
its
forms
its
indirect
action
in
shaping
æsthetic
criteria
constitutes
its
chief
value
as
an
element
of
culture
the
habit
of
regarding
art
as
a
thing
apart
from
life
is
fatal
to
the
development
of
taste
parents
may
conscientiously
send
their
children
to
galleries
and
museums
but
unless
the
child
can
find
some
point
of
contact
between
its
own
surroundings
and
the
contents
of
the
galleries
the
interest
excited
by
the
pictures
and
statues
will
be
and
ineffectual
children
are
not
reached
by
abstract
ideas
and
a
picture
hanging
on
a
museum
wall
is
little
better
than
an
abstraction
to
the
child
vivid
but
restricted
imagination
besides
if
the
home
surroundings
are
tasteless
the
unawakened
sense
of
form
will
not
be
roused
by
a
hurried
walk
through
a
museum
the
mind
must
be
prepared
by
daily
lessons
in
beauty
to
understand
the
masterpieces
of
art
a
child
brought
up
on
foolish
could
hardly
be
expected
to
enjoy
knight
or
the
without
some
slight
initiation
into
the
nature
and
meaning
of
good
literature
and
to
pass
from
a
house
full
of
ugly
furniture
badly
designed
and
worthless
to
a
hurried
contemplation
of
the
venus
of
milo
or
of
a
model
of
the
parthenon
is
not
likely
to
produce
the
desired
results
the
daily
intercourse
with
poor
pictures
trashy
ornaments
and
badly
designed
furniture
may
indeed
be
fittingly
compared
with
a
mental
diet
of
silly
and
ungrammatical
most
parents
nowadays
recognize
the
harmfulness
of
such
a
and
are
careful
to
feed
their
children
on
more
stimulating
fare
skilful
compilers
have
placed
mallory
and
chaucer
cervantes
and
froissart
within
reach
of
the
childish
understanding
thus
laying
the
foundations
for
a
lasting
appreciation
of
good
literature
no
greater
service
can
be
rendered
to
children
than
in
teaching
them
to
know
the
best
and
to
want
it
but
while
this
is
now
generally
conceded
with
regard
to
books
the
child
eager
eyes
are
left
to
fare
as
best
they
may
on
chromos
from
the
illustrated
papers
and
on
carefully
hoarded
rubbish
from
the
christmas
tree
the
mention
of
the
christmas
tree
suggests
another
obstacle
to
the
early
development
of
taste
many
children
besides
being
surrounded
by
ugly
furniture
and
bad
pictures
are
overwhelmed
at
christmas
and
on
every
other
anniversary
by
presents
not
always
selected
with
a
view
to
the
formation
of
taste
the
question
of
presents
is
one
of
the
most
embarrassing
problems
in
the
artistic
education
of
children
as
long
as
they
are
in
the
toy
age
no
great
harm
is
done
it
is
when
they
are
considered
old
enough
to
appreciate
something
pretty
for
their
rooms
that
the
season
of
danger
begins
parents
themselves
are
often
the
worst
offenders
in
this
respect
and
the
sooner
they
begin
to
give
their
children
presents
which
if
not
beautiful
are
at
least
useful
the
sooner
will
the
example
be
followed
by
relatives
and
friends
the
selection
of
such
presents
while
it
might
necessitate
a
little
more
trouble
need
not
lead
to
greater
expense
good
things
do
not
always
cost
more
than
bad
a
good
print
may
often
be
bought
for
the
same
price
as
a
poor
one
and
the
money
spent
on
a
china
ornament
in
the
shape
of
a
yellow
leghorn
hat
with
a
kitten
climbing
out
of
it
would
probably
purchase
a
good
reproduction
of
one
of
the
tanagra
statuettes
a
plaster
cast
of
some
french
or
italian
bust
or
one
of
cantagalli
copies
of
the
robbia
any
of
which
would
reveal
a
world
of
unsuspected
beauty
to
many
a
child
imprisoned
in
a
circle
of
de
the
children
of
the
rich
are
usually
the
worst
sufferers
in
such
cases
since
the
presents
received
by
those
whose
parents
and
relations
are
not
well
off
have
the
saving
merit
of
usefulness
it
is
the
superfluous
gimcrack
the
ornament
which
is
most
objectionable
and
the
more
expensive
such
articles
are
the
more
likely
are
they
to
do
harm
rich
children
suffer
from
the
quantity
as
well
as
the
quality
of
the
presents
they
receive
appetite
is
surfeited
curiosity
blunted
by
the
mass
of
offerings
poured
in
with
every
anniversary
it
would
be
better
if
in
such
cases
friends
and
family
could
unite
in
giving
to
each
child
one
thing
worth
having
a
good
edition
a
etching
or
engraving
or
some
like
object
fitted
to
give
pleasure
at
the
time
and
lasting
enjoyment
through
life
parents
often
make
the
mistake
of
thinking
that
such
presents
are
too
serious
that
children
do
not
care
for
good
bindings
fine
engravings
or
reproductions
of
sculpture
as
a
matter
of
fact
children
are
quick
to
appreciate
beauty
when
pointed
out
and
explained
to
them
and
an
intelligent
child
feels
peculiar
pride
in
being
the
owner
of
some
object
which
people
would
be
glad
to
possess
if
the
selection
of
such
presents
is
made
with
a
reasonable
regard
for
the
child
tastes
and
understanding
if
the
book
chosen
is
a
good
edition
well
bound
of
the
or
of
if
the
print
represents
some
tuscan
nativity
with
a
joyous
dance
of
angels
on
the
thatched
roof
or
a
group
of
splendid
horsemen
and
strange
animals
from
the
wondrous
of
the
riccardi
chapel
the
present
will
give
as
much
immediate
pleasure
as
a
juvenile
book
or
picture
while
its
intrinsic
beauty
and
significance
may
become
important
factors
in
the
child
æsthetic
development
the
possession
of
something
valuable
that
may
not
be
knocked
about
but
must
be
handled
with
care
and
restored
to
its
place
after
being
looked
at
will
also
cultivate
in
the
child
that
habit
of
carefulness
and
order
which
may
be
defined
as
good
manners
toward
inanimate
objects
children
suffer
not
only
from
the
number
of
presents
they
receive
but
from
that
of
modern
rooms
that
so
often
makes
it
necessary
to
use
the
and
nurseries
as
an
outlet
for
the
overflow
of
the
house
to
the
children
quarters
come
one
by
one
the
countless
objects
too
good
to
throw
away
but
too
ugly
to
be
tolerated
by
eyes
the
cushions
that
have
associations
the
mildewed
landseer
prints
of
foaming
dying
animals
the
madonna
and
apostles
in
bituminous
draperies
commemorating
a
paternal
visit
to
rome
in
the
days
when
people
bought
copies
of
the
old
masters
those
who
wish
to
train
their
children
taste
must
resolutely
clear
the
of
all
such
ugly
furniture
can
not
always
be
replaced
but
it
is
at
least
possible
to
remove
unsuitable
pictures
and
it
is
essential
that
the
should
be
cheerful
dark
colors
besides
necessitating
the
use
of
much
artificial
light
are
depressing
to
children
and
consequently
out
of
place
in
the
white
woodwork
and
walls
tinted
in
some
bright
color
form
the
best
background
for
both
work
and
play
perhaps
the
most
interesting
way
of
decorating
the
is
that
which
might
be
described
as
the
rotation
system
to
carry
out
this
plan
which
requires
the
coöperation
of
the
children
teacher
the
walls
must
be
tinted
in
some
light
color
such
as
or
pale
green
and
cleared
of
all
miscellaneous
adornments
these
should
then
be
replaced
by
a
few
prints
photographs
and
plaster
casts
representing
objects
connected
with
the
studies
let
it
for
instance
be
supposed
that
the
studies
in
hand
include
natural
history
botany
and
the
history
of
france
and
england
during
the
sixteenth
century
these
subjects
might
be
respectively
illustrated
by
some
of
the
clever
japanese
outline
drawings
of
plants
and
animals
by
holbein
portrait
of
henry
viii
clouet
of
charles
ix
and
of
elizabeth
of
austria
dürer
etchings
of
luther
and
erasmus
and
views
of
some
of
the
principal
buildings
erected
in
france
and
england
during
the
sixteenth
century
the
prints
and
casts
shown
at
one
time
should
be
sufficiently
inexpensive
and
few
in
number
to
be
changed
as
the
child
lessons
proceed
thus
forming
a
kind
of
continuous
commentary
upon
the
various
branches
of
study
this
plan
of
course
necessitates
more
trouble
and
expense
than
the
ordinary
one
of
giving
to
the
walls
of
the
a
permanent
decoration
an
arrangement
which
may
also
be
made
interesting
and
suggestive
if
the
child
requirements
are
considered
when
casts
and
pictures
are
intended
to
remain
in
place
it
is
a
good
idea
to
choose
them
at
the
outset
with
a
view
to
the
course
of
studies
likely
to
be
followed
in
this
way
each
object
may
serve
in
turn
to
illustrate
some
phase
of
history
or
art
even
this
plan
will
be
found
to
have
a
vivifying
effect
upon
the
dry
bones
of
lessons
in
a
room
decorated
in
this
fashion
the
prints
or
photographs
selected
might
represent
the
foremost
examples
of
greek
gothic
renaissance
and
architecture
together
with
several
famous
paintings
of
different
periods
and
schools

parents
who
do
not
care
to
plan
the
adornment
of
the
on
such
definite
lines
should
at
least
be
careful
to
choose
appropriate
casts
and
pictures
it
is
generally
conceded
that
nothing
painful
should
be
put
before
a
child
eyes
but
the
deleterious
effects
of
prettiness
are
too
often
disregarded
anything
sweet
is
considered
appropriate
for
the
or
nursery
whereas
it
is
essential
to
the
child
artistic
training
that
only
the
sweetness
which
proceeds
should
be
held
up
for
admiration
it
is
easy
to
find
among

are

the

should

a
bookcase
with

is
a
valuable
factor
in
the
training
of
children
it
teaches
a
respect
for
books
by
showing
that
they
are
thought
worthy
of
care
and
a
child
is
less
likely
to
knock
about
and
damage
a
book
which
must
be

from
and
restored
to
such

is

a
square
of

containing

and

the
decoration
of
the
latter
room
will
of
course
be
adapted
to
the
tastes
of
the
younger
children
mothers
often
say
in
answer
to
suggestions
as
to
the
decoration
of
the
nursery
that
little
children
like
something
bright
as
though
this
precluded
every
form
of
art
above

and
the

it
is
easy
to
produce
an
effect
of
brightness

means
of

and

hung
with
good
colored
prints
with
large
photographs
of
old
flemish
or
italian

for
example
bellini
playing
on
musical
instruments
and
with
a
few
of
the
japanese
plant
and
animal
drawings
already
referred
to
all
these
subjects
would
interest
and
amuse
even
very
young
children
and
there
is
no
reason
why
a
gay
japanese
screen
with
boldly
drawn
birds
and
flowers
should
not
afford
as
much
entertainment
as
one
composed
of
a
heterogeneous
collection
of
christmas
cards
chromos
and
pictures
put
together
without
any
attempt
at
or
composition
children
rooms
should
be
as
free
as
possible
from
all
superfluous
draperies
the
windows
may
be
hung
with
either
shades
or
curtains
it
is
needless
to
have
both
if
curtains
are
preferred
they
should
be
of
chintz
or
of
some
washable
cotton
or
linen
the
reproductions
of
the
old
de
with
pictures
from
æsop
and
la
fontaine
or
from
some
familiar
myth
or
story
are
specially
suited
to
children
rooms
while
another
source
of
interest
and
amusement
may
be
provided
by
facing
the
fireplace
with
blue
and
white
dutch
tiles
representing
the
finding
of
moses
the
story
of
david
and
goliath
or
some
such
familiar
episode
as
children
grow
older
and
are
allotted
separate
bedrooms
these
should
be
furnished
and
decorated
on
the
same
principles
and
with
the
same
care
as
the
pieces
of
furniture
for
these
bedrooms
would
make
far
more
suitable
and
interesting
presents
than
the
costly
odds
and
ends
so
often
given
without
definite
intention
in
the
arrangement
of
the
child
own
room
the
expression
of
individual
taste
should
be
encouraged
and
the
child
allowed
to
choose
the
pictures
and
casts
with
which
the
walls
are
hung
the
responsibility
of
such
selection
will
do
much
to
develop
the
incipient
faculties
of
observation
and
comparison
to
sum
up
then
the
child
visible
surroundings
form
the
basis
of
the
best
because
of
the
most
unconscious
cultivation
and
not
of
æsthetic
cultivation
only
since
as
has
been
pointed
out
the
development
of
any
artistic
taste
if
the
child
general
training
is
of
the
right
sort
indirectly
broadens
the
whole
view
of
life
xvi
it
is
perhaps
not
uninstructive
to
note
that
we
have
no
english
word
to
describe
the
class
of
household
ornaments
which
french
speech
has
provided
with
at
least
three
designations
each
indicating
a
delicate
and
almost
imperceptible
gradation
of
quality
in
place
of
bibelots
we
have
only
defined
by
stormonth
as
articles
of
small
value
this
definition
of
the
fairly
indicates
the
general
level
of
our
artistic
competence
it
has
already
been
said
that
cheapness
is
not
necessarily
synonymous
with
trashiness
but
hitherto
this
assertion
has
been
made
with
regard
to
furniture
and
to
the
other
necessary
appointments
of
the
house
with
the
case
is
different
an
artistic
age
will
of
course
produce
any
number
of
inexpensive
trifles
fit
to
become
like
the
tanagra
figurines
the
museum
treasures
of
later
centuries
but
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
point
out
that
modern
are
not
overflowing
with
such
immortal
toys
the
few
objects
of
art
produced
in
the
present
day
are
the
work
of
distinguished
artists
even
allowing
for
what
symonds
calls
the
vicissitudes
of
taste
it
seems
improbable
that
our
commercial
will
ever
be
classed
as
a
work
of
art

it
is
clear
that
the
weary
man
must
have
a
chair
to
sit
on
the
hungry
man
a
table
to
dine
at
nor
would
the
most
sensitive
judgment
condemn
him
for
buying
ugly
ones
were
no
others
to
be
had
but
objects
of
art
are
a
counsel
of
perfection
it
is
quite
possible
to
go
without
them
and
the
proof
is
that
many
do
go
without
them
who
honestly
think
to
possess
them
in
abundance
this
is
said
not
with
any
intention
of
turning
to
ridicule
the
natural
desire
to
make
a
room
look
pretty
but
merely
with
the
purpose
of
inquiring
whether
such
an
object
is
ever
furthered
by
the
indiscriminate
amassing
of
ornaments
decorators
know
how
much
the
simplicity
and
dignity
of
a
good
room
are
diminished
by
crowding
it
with
useless
trifles
their
absence
improves
even
bad
rooms
or
makes
them
at
least
less
multitudinously
bad
it
is
surprising
to
note
how
the
removal
of
an
accumulation
of
will
free
the
architectural
lines
and
restore
the
furniture
to
its
rightful
relation
with
the
walls
though
a
room
must
depend
for
its
main
beauty
on
design
and
furniture
it
is
obvious
that
there
are
many
details
of
luxurious
living
not
included
in
these
essentials
in
what
then
shall
the
ornamentation
of
rooms
consist
supposing
walls
and
furniture
to
be
satisfactory
how
put
the
minor
touches
that
give
to
a
room
the
charm
of
completeness
to
arrive
at
an
answer
one
must
first
consider
the
different
kinds
of
minor
embellishment
these
may
be
divided
into
two
classes
the
object
of
art
such
as
the
bust
the
picture
or
the
vase
and
on
the
other
hand
those
articles
useful
in
themselves
lamps
clocks
bookbindings
candelabra
which
art
has
only
to
touch
to
make
them
the
best
ornaments
any
room
can
contain
in
past
times
such
articles
took
the
place
of
bibelots
few
purely
ornamental
objects
were
to
be
seen
save
in
the
cabinets
of
collectors
but
when
botticelli
decorated
the
panels
of
linen
chests
and
cellini
chiselled
and
there
could
be
no
thought
of
the
vicious
distinction
between
the
useful
and
the
beautiful
one
of
the
first
obligations
of
art
is
to
make
all
useful
things
beautiful
were
this
neglected
principle
applied
to
the
manufacture
of
household
accessories
the
modern
room
would
have
no
need
of
before
proceeding
further
it
is
necessary
to
know
what
constitutes
an
object
of
art
it
was
said
at
the
outset
that
though
cheapness
and
trashiness
are
not
always
synonymous
they
are
apt
to
be
so
in
the
case
of
the
modern
to
buy
and
even
to
make
it
may
cost
a
great
deal
of
money
but
artistically
it
is
cheap
if
not
worthless
and
too
often
its
artistic
value
is
in
inverse
ratio
to
its
price
the
china
pug
is
less
harmful
than
an
expensive
onyx
with
moulded
bronze
mountings
dipped
in
liquid
gilding
it
is
one
of
the
misfortunes
of
the
present
time
that
the
most
preposterously
bad
things
often
possess
the
powerful
allurement
of
being
expensive
one
might
think
it
an
advantage
that
they
are
not
within
every
reach
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
their
very
unattainableness
which
by
making
them
more
desirable
leads
to
the
production
of
that
worst
curse
of
modern
civilization
cheap
copies
of
costly
horrors
an
ornament
is
of
course
not
an
object
of
art
because
it
is
expensive
though
it
must
be
owned
that
objects
of
art
are
seldom
cheap
good
workmanship
as
distinct
from
designing
almost
always
commands
a
higher
price
than
bad
and
good
artistic
workmanship
having
become
so
rare
that
there
is
practically
no
increase
in
the
existing
quantity
of
objects
of
art
it
is
evident
that
these
are
more
likely
to
grow
than
to
diminish
in
value
still
as
has
been
said
costliness
is
no
test
of
merit
in
an
age
when
large
prices
are
paid
for
bad
things
perhaps
the
most
convenient
way
of
defining
the
real
object
of
art
is
to
describe
it
as
ornamental
object
which
adequately
expresses
an
artistic
this
definition
at
least
clears
the
ground
of
the
mass
of
showy
rubbish
forming
the
of
the
average
antiquity
dealer
good
objects
of
art
give
to
a
room
its
crowning
touch
of
distinction
their
intrinsic
beauty
is
hardly
more
valuable
than
their
suggestion
of
a
mellower
civilization
of
days
when
rich
men
were
patrons
of
the
arts
of
elegance
and
when
collecting
beautiful
objects
was
one
of
the
obligations
of
a
noble
leisure
the
qualities
implied
in
the
ownership
of
such
bibelots
are
the
mark
of
their
unattainableness
the
man
who
wishes
to
possess
objects
of
art
must
have
not
only
the
means
to
acquire
them
but
the
skill
to
choose
them
a
skill
made
up
of
cultivation
and
judgment
combined
with
that
feeling
for
beauty
that
no
amount
of
study
can
give
but
that
study
alone
can
quicken
and
render
profitable
only
time
and
experience
can
acquaint
one
with
those
minor
peculiarities
marking
the
successive
manners
of
a
master
or
even
with
the
technical
which
at
once
enable
the
collector
to
affix
a
date
to
his
sèvres
or
to
his
maiolica
such
knowledge
is
acquired
at
the
cost
of
great
pains
and
of
frequent
mistakes
but
no
one
should
venture
to
buy
works
of
art
who
can
not
at
least
draw
such
obvious
distinctions
as
those
between
old
and
new
saxe
between
an
old
italian
and
a
modern
french
bronze
or
between
chinese
porcelain
of
the
period
and
the
japanese
imitations
to
be
found
in
every
oriental
emporium
supposing
the
amateur
to
have
acquired
this
proficiency
he
is
still
apt
to
buy
too
many
things
or
things
out
of
proportion
with
the
rooms
for
which
they
are
intended
the
scoffers
at
style
those
who
assume
that
to
conform
to
any
known
laws
of
decoration
is
to
sink
individuality
often
justify
their
view
by
the
assertion
that
it
is
ridiculous
to
be
tied
down
in
the
choice
of
bibelots
to
any
given
period
or
manner
as
though
mazarin
great
collection
had
comprised
only
works
of
art
or
the
colonnas
the
gonzagas
and
the
malatestas
had
drawn
all
their
treasures
from
contemporary
sources
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
great
amateurs
of
the
past
were
never
fettered
by
such
absurd
restrictions
all
famous
patrons
of
art
have
encouraged
the
talent
of
their
day
but
the
passion
for
collecting
antiquities
is
at
least
as
old
as
the
roman
empire
and
sculptors
had
to
make
archaistic
statues
to
please
the
popular
fancy
just
as
our
artists
paint
pictures
to
attract
the
disciples
of
ruskin
and
william
morris
since
the
roman
empire
there
has
probably
been
no
period
when
a
taste
for
the
best
of
all
ages
did
not
exist
julius
ii
while
michel
angelo
and
raphael
worked
under
his
orders
was
gathering
antiques
for
the
belvedere
under
louis
xiv
greek
marbles
roman
bronzes
cabinets
of
chinese
lacquer
and
tables
of
florentine
mosaic
were
mingled
without
thought
of
discord
against
lebrun
tapestries
or
bérain
arabesques
and
collection
united
oriental
porcelains
with
goldsmiths
work
of
the
italian
renaissance
taste
attaches
but
two
conditions
to
the
use
of
objects
of
art
that
they
shall
be
in
scale
with
the
room
and
that
the
room
shall
not
be
overcrowded
with
them
there
are
two
ways
of
being
in
scale
there
is
the
scale
of
proportion
and
what
might
be
called
the
scale
of
appropriateness
the
former
is
a
matter
of
actual
measurement
while
the
latter
is
regulated
solely
by
the
nicer
standard
of
good
taste
even
in
the
matter
of
actual
measurement
the
niceties
of
proportion
are
not
always
clear
to
an
unpractised
eye
it
is
easy
to
see
that
the
ludovisi
juno
would
be
out
of
scale
in
a
boudoir
but
the
discrepancy
in
diminishing
naturally
becomes
less
obvious
again
a
vase
or
a
bust
may
not
be
out
of
scale
with
the
behind
it
but
may
appear
to
crush
the
furniture
upon
which
it
stands
and
since
everything
a
room
contains
should
be
regarded
as
a
factor
in
its
general
composition
the
relation
of
to
furniture
is
no
less
to
be
studied
than
the
relation
of
to
much
of
course
depends
upon
the
effect
intended
and
this
can
be
greatly
modified
by
careful
adjustment
of
the
contents
of
the
room
a
ceiling
may
be
made
to
look
less
high
by
the
use
of
wide
low
pieces
of
furniture
with
massive
busts
and
vases
while
a
room
may
be
heightened
by
tall
narrow
commodes
and
cabinets
with
objects
of
art
upon
the
same
general
lines
it
is
of
no
less
importance
to
observe
the
scale
of
appropriateness
a
bronze
pallas
athene
or
a
cowled
mediæval
would
be
obviously
out
of
harmony
with
the
spirit
of
a
boudoir
while
the
delicate
graces
of
old
saxe
or
chelsea
would
become
futile
in
library
or
study
another
kind
of
appropriateness
must
be
considered
in
the
relation
of
objects
of
art
to
each
other
not
only
must
they
be
in
scale
as
regards
character
and
dimensions
but
also
and
this
though
more
important
is
perhaps
less
often
considered
as
regards
quality
the
habit
of
mixing
good
bad
and
indifferent
in
furniture
is
often
excused
by
necessity
people
must
use
what
they
have
but
there
is
no
necessity
for
having
bad
trashy
ornaments
do
not
make
a
room
more
comfortable
as
a
general
rule
they
distinctly
diminish
its
comfort
and
they
have
the
further
disadvantage
of
destroying
the
effect
of
any
good
piece
of
work
vulgarity
is
always
noisier
than
good
breeding
and
it
is
instructive
to
note
how
a
modern
commercial
bronze
will
talk
down
a
delicate
renaissance
statuette
or
bust
and
a
piece
of
deck
or
minton
china
efface
the
of
or
the
soft
tints
of
old
sèvres
even
those
who
set
down
a
preference
for
old
furniture
as
an
affectation
will
hardly
maintain
that
new
are
as
good
as
old
bibelots
but
only
those
who
have
some
slight
acquaintance
with
the
subject
know
how
wide
is
the
distance
in
conception
and
execution
between
the
old
object
of
art
and
its
unworthy
successor
yet
the
explanation
is
simple
in
former
times
as
the
greatest
painters
occupied
themselves
with
so
the
greatest
sculptors
and
modellers
produced
the
delicate
statuettes
and
the
incomparable
bronze
mountings
for
vases
and
furniture
adorning
the
apartments
of
their
day
a
glance
into
the
window
of
the
average
probably
convinces
the
most
unobservant
that
modern
bronze
mountings
are
not
usually
designed
by
great
artists
and
there
is
the
same
change
in
the
methods
of
execution
the
bronze
formerly
chiselled
is
now
moulded
the
iron
once
wrought
is
cast
the
patina
given
to
bronze
by
a
chemical
process
making
it
a
part
of
the
texture
of
the
metal
is
now
simply
applied
as
a
surface
wash
and
this
deterioration
in
processes
has
done
more
than
anything
else
to
vulgarize
modern
ornament
it
may
be
argued
that
even
in
the
golden
age
of
art
few
could
have
walls
decorated
by
great
painters
or
modelled
by
great
sculptors
but
it
is
here
that
the
superiority
of
the
old
method
is
shown
below
the
great
painter
and
sculptor
came
the
trained
designer
who
formed
in
the
same
school
as
his
superiors
did
not
attempt
a
poor
copy
of
their
masterpieces
but
did
the
same
kind
of
work
on
simpler
lines
just
as
below
the
skilled
artificer
stood
the
plain
artisan
whose
work
was
executed
more
rudely
but
by
the
same
genuine
processes
this
explains
the
supposed
affectation
of
those
who
like
things
just
because
they
are
old
old
and
furniture
are
indeed
almost
always
worthy
of
liking
since
they
are
made
on
good
lines
by
a
good
process
two
causes
connected
with
the
change
in
processes
have
contributed
to
the
debasement
of
bibelots
the
substitution
of
machine
for
has
made
possible
the
unlimited
reproduction
of
works
of
art
and
the
resulting
demand
for
cheap
has
given
employment
to
a
multitude
of
untrained
designers
having
nothing
in
common
with
the
of
former
times
it
is
an
open
question
how
much
the
mere
possibility
of
unlimited
reproduction
detracts
from
the
intrinsic
value
of
an
object
of
art
to
the
as
distinguished
from
the
collector
uniqueness
can
give
no
value
to
an
inartistic
object
but
the
distinction
the
personal
quality
of
a
beautiful
object
is
certainly
enhanced
when
it
is
known
to
be
alone
of
its
kind
as
in
the
case
of
the
old
bronzes
made
cire
it
must
however
be
noted
that
in
some
cases
as
in
that
of
the
method
which
permits
reproduction
is
distinctly
inferior
to
that
used
when
but
one
object
is
to
be
produced
in
writing
on
objects
of
art
it
is
difficult
to
escape
the
charge
of
saying
on
one
page
that
reproductions
are
objectionable
and
on
the
next
that
they
are
better
than
poor
originals
the
united
states
customs
laws
have
drawn
a
rough
distinction
between
an
original
work
and
its
reproductions
defining
the
former
as
a
work
of
art
and
the
latter
as
articles
of
commerce
but
it
does
not
follow
that
an
article
of
commerce
may
not
be
an
adequate
representation
of
a
work
of
art
the
technical
differences
incidental
to
the
various
forms
of
reproduction
make
any
general
conclusion
impossible
in
the
case
of
bronzes
for
instance
it
has
been
pointed
out
that
the
process
is
superior
to
that
by
means
of
which
reproductions
may
be
made
nor
is
this
the
only
cause
of
inferiority
in
bronze
reproductions
the
nature
of
makes
it
needful
that
the
final
touches
should
be
given
to
bust
or
statue
after
it
emerges
from
the
mould
upon
these
touches
given
by
the
master
chisel
the
expressiveness
and
significance
of
the
work
chiefly
depend
and
multiplied
reproductions
in
lacking
this
individual
stamp
must
lack
precisely
that
which
distinguishes
the
work
of
art
from
the
commercial
article
perhaps
the
safest
general
rule
is
to
say
that
the
less
the
reproduction
suggests
an
attempt
at
artistic
interpretation
the
more
literal
and
mechanical
is
its
rendering
of
the
original
the
better
it
fulfils
its
purpose
thus
of
sculpture
are
more
satisfactory
than
bronze
or
marble
copies
and
a
good
photograph
of
a
painting
is
superior
to
the
average
reproduction
in
oils
or
the
deterioration
in
gilding
is
one
of
the
most
striking
examples
of
the
modern
disregard
of
quality
and
execution
in
former
times
gilding
was
regarded
as
one
of
the
crowning
touches
of
magnificence
in
decoration
was
little
used
except
where
great
splendor
of
effect
was
desired
and
was
then
applied
by
means
of
a
difficult
and
costly
process
after
a
period
of
reaction
during
which
all
gilding
was
avoided
it
is
again
unsparingly
used
under
the
mistaken
impression
that
it
is
one
of
the
chief
characteristics
of
the
french
styles
now
once
more
in
demand
the
result
is
a
plague
of
liquid
gilding
even
in
france
where
good
gilding
is
still
done
the
great
demand
for
cheap
gilt
furniture
and
ornaments
has
led
to
the
general
use
of
the
inferior
process
the
prevalence
of
liquid
gilding
and
the
application
of
gold
to
furniture
and
decoration
not
adapted
to
such
treatment
doubtless
explain
the
aversion
of
many
persons
to
any
use
of
gilding
in
decoration
in
former
times
the
expense
of
good
gilding
was
no
obstacle
to
its
use
since
it
was
employed
only
in
gala
rooms
where
the
whole
treatment
was
on
the
same
scale
of
costliness
it
would
never
have
occurred
to
the
owner
of
an
house
to
drench
his
walls
and
furniture
in
gilding
since
the
excessive
use
of
gold
in
decoration
was
held
to
be
quite
unsuited
to
such
a
purpose
nothing
more
surely
preserves
any
form
of
ornament
from
vulgarization
than
a
general
sense
of
fitness
much
of
the
beauty
and
propriety
of
old
decoration
was
due
to
the
fact
that
the
merit
of
a
work
of
art
was
held
to
consist
not
in
substance
but
in
design
and
execution
it
was
never
thought
that
a
badly
designed
bust
or
vase
could
be
saved
from
mediocrity
by
being
made
of
an
expensive
material
suitability
of
substance
always
enhances
a
work
of
art
mere
costliness
never
the
chryselephantine
zeus
of
olympia
was
doubtless
admirably
suited
to
the
splendor
of
its
surroundings
but
in
a
different
setting
it
would
have
been
as
beautiful
in
marble
in
plastic
art
everything
depends
on
form
and
execution
and
the
skilful
handling
of
a
substance
deliberately
chosen
for
its
resistance
where
another
might
have
been
used
with
equal
fitness
is
rather
a
de
than
an
artistic
achievement
these
last
generalizations
are
intended
to
show
not
only
that
there
is
an
intrinsic
value
in
almost
all
old
bibelots
but
also
that
the
general
excellence
of
design
and
execution
in
past
times
has
handed
down
to
us
many
unimportant
trifles
in
the
way
of
furniture
and
household
appliances
worthy
of
being
regarded
as
minor
objects
of
art
in
italy
especially
where
every
artisan
seems
to
have
had
the
gift
of
the
in
his
and
no
substance
was
thought
too
poor
to
express
a
good
design
there
are
still
to
be
found
many
bits
of
old
workmanship
clocks
and
carved
with
touches
of
gilding
that
may
be
characterized
in
the
terms
applied
by
the
builder
of
buckingham
house
to
his
collection
of
pictures
some
good
still
no
accumulation
of
such
trifles
even
where
none
is
disagreeable
will
give
to
a
room
the
same
distinction
as
the
presence
of
a
few
really
fine
works
of
art
any
one
who
has
the
patience
to
put
up
with
that
look
of
bareness
so
displeasing
to
some
will
do
better
to
buy
each
year
one
superior
piece
rather
than
a
dozen
of
middling
quality
even
the
buyer
who
need
consult
only
his
own
pleasure
must
remember
that
his
very
freedom
from
the
ordinary
restrictions
lays
him
open
to
temptation
it
is
no
longer
likely
that
any
collector
will
be
embarrassed
by
a
superfluity
of
treasures
but
he
may
put
too
many
things
into
one
room
and
no
amount
of
individual
merit
in
the
objects
themselves
will
from
the
decorator
standpoint
quite
warrant
this
mistake
any
work
of
art
regardless
of
its
intrinsic
merit
must
justify
its
presence
in
a
room
by
being
valuable
than
the
space
it
more
valuable
that
is
to
the
general
scheme
of
decoration
those
who
call
this
view
arbitrary
or
pedantic
should
consider
first
the
importance
of
plain
surfaces
in
decoration
and
secondly
the
tendency
of
overcrowding
to
minimize
the
effect
of
each
separate
object
however
striking
in
itself
eye
and
mind
are
limited
in
their
receptivity
to
a
certain
number
of
simultaneous
impressions
and
the
oriental
habit
of
displaying
only
one
or
two
objects
of
art
at
a
time
shows
a
more
delicate
sense
of
these
limitations
than
the
western
passion
for
multiplying
effects
to
sum
up
then
a
room
should
depend
for
its
adornment
on
general
harmony
of
parts
and
on
the
artistic
quality
of
such
necessities
as
lamps
screens
bindings
and
furniture
whoever
goes
beyond
these
essentials
should
limit
himself
in
the
choice
of
ornaments
to
the
labors
of
the
hand
footnote
a
little
study
would
probably
show
that
the
ptolemaic
era
in
egypt
was
a
renaissance
of
the
theban
age
in
architecture
as
in
other
respects
while
the
golden
period
of
augustus
in
rome
was
largely
a
greek
revival
perhaps
it
would
even
be
discovered
that
all
ages
of
healthy
human
prosperity
are
more
or
less
revivals
and
have
been
marked
by
a
retrospective
tendency

conclusion
in
the
preceding
pages
an
attempt
has
been
made
to
show
that
in
the
treatment
of
rooms
we
have
passed
from
the
golden
age
of
architecture
to
the
gilded
age
of
decoration
any
argument
in
support
of
a
special
claim
necessitates
certain
apparent
injustices
sets
up
certain
provisional
limitations
and
can
therefore
be
judged
with
fairness
only
by
those
who
make
due
allowance
for
these
conditions
in
the
discussion
of
æsthetics
such
impartiality
can
seldom
be
expected
not
unnaturally
people
resent
any
attempt
to
dogmatize
on
matters
so
generally
thought
to
lie
within
the
domain
of
individual
judgment
many
hold
that
in
questions
of
taste
ist
while
those
who
believe
that
beyond
the
oscillations
of
fashion
certain
fixed
laws
may
be
discerned
have
as
yet
agreed
upon
no
formula
defining
their
belief
in
short
our
civilization
has
not
yet
developed
any
artistic
creed
so
generally
recognized
that
it
may
be
invoked
on
both
sides
of
an
argument
without
risk
of
misunderstanding
this
is
true
at
least
of
those
forms
of
art
that
minister
only
to
the
æsthetic
sense
with
architecture
and
its
allied
branches
the
case
is
different
here
beauty
depends
on
fitness
and
the
practical
requirements
of
life
are
the
ultimate
test
of
fitness
if
therefore
it
can
be
proved
that
the
old
practice
was
based
upon
a
clearer
perception
of
these
requirements
than
is
shown
by
modern
decorators
it
may
be
claimed
not
unreasonably
that
the
old
methods
are
better
than
the
new
it
seems
however
that
the
distinction
between
the
various
offices
of
art
is
no
longer
clearly
recognized
the
merit
of
is
now
seldom
measured
by
the
standard
of
practical
fitness
and
those
who
would
set
up
such
a
standard
are
suspected
of
proclaiming
individual
preferences
under
the
guise
of
general
principles
in
this
book
an
endeavor
has
been
made
to
draw
no
conclusion
unwarranted
by
the
premises
but
whatever
may
be
thought
of
the
soundness
of
some
of
the
deductions
they
must
be
regarded
not
as
a
criticism
of
individual
work
but
simply
of
certain
tendencies
in
modern
architecture
it
must
be
remembered
too
that
the
book
is
merely
a
sketch
intended
to
indicate
the
lines
along
which
further
study
may
profitably
advance
it
may
seem
inconsequent
that
an
elementary
work
should
include
much
apparently
unimportant
detail
to
pass
in
a
single
chapter
from
a
discussion
of
abstract
architectural
laws
to
the
combination
of
colors
in
a
bedroom
carpet
seems
to
show
lack
of
plan
yet
the
transition
is
logically
justified
in
the
composition
of
a
whole
there
is
no
negligible
quantity
if
the
decoration
of
a
room
is
planned
on
certain
definite
principles
whatever
contributes
line
or
color
becomes
a
factor
in
the
composition
the
relation
of
proportion
to
decoration
is
like
that
of
anatomy
to
sculpture
underneath
are
the
everlasting
laws
it
was
the
recognition
of
this
principle
that
kept
the
work
of
the
old
for
the
two
were
one
free
from
the
superfluous
free
from
the
intemperate
accumulation
that
marks
so
many
modern
rooms
where
each
detail
had
its
determinate
part
no
superficial
accessories
were
needed
to
make
up
a
whole
a
great
draughtsman
represents
with
a
few
strokes
what
lesser
artists
can
express
only
by
a
multiplicity
of
lines
the
supreme
excellence
is
simplicity
moderation
fitness
relevance
these
are
the
qualities
that
give
permanence
to
the
work
of
the
great
architects
