this
little

purposes
to
present
a
general
view
of
artistic
and
to
offer
to
young
students
the
results
of
such
observations
as
i
have
made
in
the
years
of
my
own
studies
as
well
as
of
the
experiences
which
my
public
activity
has
brought
me
it
is
of
course
only
the
concrete
the
material
side
of
that
can
be
dealt
with
here
that
part
of
it
which
aims
to
reproduce
in
tones
what
is
plainly
stated
in
the
printed
lines
of
a
composition
the
other
very
much
subtler
part
of
draws
upon
and
indeed
depends
upon
imagination
refinement
of
sensibility
and
spiritual
vision
and
endeavours
to
convey
to
an
audience
what
the
composer
has
consciously
or
unconsciously
hidden
the
lines
that
almost
entirely
psychic
side
of
eludes
treatment
in
literary
form
and
must
therefore
not
be
looked
for
in
this
little
volume
it
may
not
be
amiss
however
to
dwell
a
moment
upon
these
elusive
matters
of
æsthetics
and
conception
though
it
be
only
to
show
how
far
apart
they
are
from
technic
when
the
material
part
the
technic
has
been
completely
acquired
by
the
piano
student
he
will
see
a
limitless
vista
opening
up
before
him
disclosing
the
vast
field
of
artistic
interpretation
in
this
field
the
work
is
largely
of
an
analytical
nature
and
requires
that
intelligence
spirit
and
sentiment
supported
by
knowledge
and
æsthetic
perception
form
a
felicitous
union
to
produce
results
of
value
and
dignity
it
is
in
this
field
that
the
student
must
learn
to
perceive
the
invisible
something
which
unifies
the
seemingly
separate
notes
groups
periods
sections
and
parts
into
an
organic
whole
the
spiritual
eye
for
this
invisible
something
is
what
musicians
have
in
mind
when
they
speak
of
reading
between
the
lines
which
is
at
once
the
most
fascinating
and
most
difficult
task
of
the
interpretative
artist
for
it
is
just
between
the
lines
where
in
literature
as
in
music
the
soul
of
a
work
of
art
lies
hidden
to
play
its
notes
even
to
play
them
correctly
is
still
very
far
from
doing
justice
to
the
life
and
soul
of
an
artistic
composition
i
should
like
to
reiterate
at
this
point
two
words
which
i
used
in
the
second
paragraph
the
words
consciously
or
unconsciously
a
brief
comment
upon
this
alternative
may
lead
to
observations
which
may
throw
a
light
upon
the
matter
of
reading
between
the
lines
especially
as
i
am
rather
strongly
inclining
toward
the
belief
in
the
unconscious
side
of
the
alternative
i
believe
that
every
composer
of
talent
not
to
speak
of
genius
in
his
moments
of
creative
fever
has
given
birth
to
thoughts
ideas
designs
that
lay
altogether
beyond
the
reach
of
his
conscious
will
and
control
in
speaking
of
the
products
of
such
periods
we
have
hit
upon
exactly
the
right
word
when
we
say
that
the
composer
has
surpassed
himself
for
in
saying
this
we
recognise
that
the
act
of
surpassing
one
self
precludes
the
control
of
the
self
a
critical
sober
overseeing
of
work
during
the
period
of
creation
is
unthinkable
for
it
is
the
fancy
and
the
imagination
that
carries
one
on
and
on
driftingly
until
the
totality
of
the
tonal
apparition
is
completed
and
mentally
as
well
as
physically
absorbed
now
inasmuch
as
the
composer
conscious
will
takes
little
or
no
part
in
the
creating
of
the
work
it
seems
to
follow
that
he
is
not
necessarily
an
absolute
authority
as
to
the
only
correct
way
of
rendering
it
pedantic
adherence
to
the
composer
own
conception
is
to
my
mind
not
an
unassailable
maxim
the
composer
way
of
rendering
his
composition
may
not
be
free
from
certain
predilections
biases
mannerisms
and
his
rendition
may
also
suffer
from
a
paucity
of
pianistic
experience
it
seems
therefore
that
to
do
justice
to
the
work
itself
is
of
far
greater
importance
than
a
slavish
adherence
to
the
composer
conception
now
to
discover
what
it
is
intellectually
or
emotionally
that
hides
itself
between
the
lines
how
to
conceive
and
how
to
interpret
it
that
must
ever
rest
with
the
reproductive
artist
provided
that
he
possesses
not
only
the
spiritual
vision
which
entitles
him
to
an
individual
conception
but
also
the
technical
skill
to
express
what
this
individual
conception
aided
by
imagination
and
analysis
has
whispered
to
him
taking
these
two
conditions
for
granted
his
interpretations
however
punctiliously
he
adhere
to
the
text
will
and
must
be
a
reflex
of
his
breeding
education
temperament
disposition
in
short
of
all
the
faculties
and
qualities
that
go
to
make
up
his
personality
and
as
these
personal
qualities
differ
between
players
their
interpretations
must
necessarily
differ
in
the
same
measure
in
some
respects
the
performance
of
a
piece
of
music
resembles
the
reading
of
a
book
aloud
to
some
one
if
a
book
should
be
read
to
us
by
a
person
who
does
not
understand
it
would
it
impress
us
as
true
convincing
or
even
credible
can
a
dull
person
by
reading
them
to
us
convey
bright
thoughts
intelligibly
even
if
such
a
person
were
drilled
to
read
with
outward
correctness
that
of
which
he
can
not
fathom
the
meaning
the
reading
could
not
seriously
engage
our
attention
because
the
reader
want
of
understanding
would
be
sure
to
effect
a
lack
of
interest
in
us
whatever
is
said
to
an
audience
be
the
speech
literary
or
musical
must
be
a
free
and
individual
expression
governed
only
by
general
or
is
it
æsthetic
laws
or
rules
it
must
be
free
to
be
artistic
and
it
must
be
individual
to
have
vital
force
traditional
conceptions
of
works
of
art
are
canned
goods
unless
the
individual
happens
to
concur
with
the
traditional
conception
which
at
best
is
very
rarely
the
case
and
does
not
speak
well
for
the
mental
calibre
of
the
easily
contented
treader
of
the
beaten
path
we
know
how
precious
a
thing
is
freedom
but
in
modern
times
it
is
not
only
precious
it
is
also
costly
it
is
based
upon
certain
possessions
this
holds
as
good
in
life
as
in
art
to
move
comfortably
with
freedom
in
life
requires
money
freedom
in
art
requires
a
sovereign
mastery
of
technic
the
pianist
artistic
upon
which
he
can
draw
at
any
moment
is
his
technic
we
do
not
gauge
him
by
it
as
an
artist
to
be
sure
but
rather
by
the
use
he
makes
of
it
just
as
we
respect
the
wealthy
according
to
the
way
in
which
they
use
their
money
and
as
there
are
wealthy
people
that
are
vulgar
so
there
may
be
pianists
who
despite
the
greatest
technic
are
not
artists
still
while
money
is
to
a
gentleman
perhaps
no
more
than
a
rather
agreeable
adjunct
technic
is
to
the
pianist
equipment
an
indispensable
necessity
to
assist
young
students
in
acquiring
this
necessity
the
following
articles
were
written
for
ladies
home
and
for
this
form
i
have
gone
over
them
and
corrected
and
amplified
i
sincerely
hope
that
they
will
help
my
young
colleagues
to
become
free
as
musicians
first
and
that
this
in
its
turn
and
with
the
help
of
good
fortune
in
their
career
will
bring
them
the
means
to
make
them
equally
free
in
their
daily
life
josef
hofmann
piano
playing
the
piano
and
its
player
the
first
requisite
for
one
who
wishes
to
become
a
musicianly
and
artistic
pianist
is
a
precise
knowledge
of
the
possibilities
and
limitations
of
the
piano
as
an
instrument
having
properly
recognised
them
both
having
thus
staked
off
a
stretch
of
ground
for
his
activity
he
must
explore
it
to
discover
all
the
resources
for
tonal
expression
that
are
hidden
within
its
pale
with
these
resources
however
he
must
be
contented
he
must
above
all
never
strive
to
rival
the
orchestra
for
there
is
no
necessity
to
attempt
anything
so
foolish
and
so
futile
since
the
gamut
of
expressions
inherent
to
the
piano
is
quite
extensive
enough
to
vouchsafe
artistic
results
of
the
very
highest
order
provided
of
course
that
this
gamut
is
used
in
an
artistic
manner
the
piano
and
the
orchestra
from
one
point
of
view
the
piano
can
claim
to
be
the
equal
of
the
orchestra
namely
in
so
far
as
it
is
no
less
than
the
orchestra
the
exponent
of
a
specific
branch
of
music
which
complete
by
itself
reposes
upon
a
literature
exclusively
its
own
and
of
a
type
so
distinguished
that
only
the
orchestra
can
claim
to
possess
its
peer
the
great
superiority
of
the
literature
of
the
piano
over
that
of
any
other
single
instrument
has
to
my
knowledge
never
been
disputed
i
think
it
is
equally
certain
that
the
piano
grants
to
its
players
a
greater
freedom
of
expression
than
any
other
instrument
greater
in
certain
respects
than
even
the
orchestra
and
very
much
greater
than
the
organ
which
after
all
lacks
the
intimate
personal
element
of
touch
and
the
immediateness
of
its
variegated
results
in
dynamic
and
colouristic
qualities
on
the
other
hand
the
piano
can
not
bear
comparison
with
the
orchestra
for
in
these
qualities
it
is
very
limited
indeed
the
prudent
player
will
not
go
beyond
these
limits
the
utmost
that
the
pianist
can
achieve
in
the
way
of
colour
may
be
likened
to
what
the
painters
call
monochrome
for
in
reality
the
piano
like
any
other
instrument
has
only
one
colour
but
the
artistic
player
can
subdivide
the
colour
into
an
infinite
number
and
variety
of
shades
the
virtue
of
a
specific
charm
too
attaches
as
much
to
the
piano
as
to
other
instruments
though
perhaps
in
a
lesser
degree
of
sensuousness
than
to
some
others
is
it
because
of
this
lesser
sensuous
charm
that
the
art
of
the
piano
is
considered
the
chastest
of
all
instruments
i
am
rather
inclined
to
think
that
it
is
partly
at
least
due
to
this
chastity
that
it
wears
best
that
we
can
listen
longer
to
a
piano
than
to
other
instruments
and
that
this
chastity
may
have
had
a
reflex
action
upon
the
character
of
its
unparagoned
literature
for
this
literature
though
we
have
to
thank
the
pianists
themselves
or
speaking
more
precisely
we
are
indebted
to
the
circumstance
that
the
piano
is
the
only
single
instrument
capable
of
conveying
the
complete
entity
of
a
composition
that
melody
bass
harmony
figuration
polyphony
and
the
most
intricate
contrapuntal
devices
can
by
skilful
hands
be
rendered
simultaneously
and
to
all
intents
and
purposes
completely
on
the
piano
has
probably
been
the
inducement
which
persuaded
the
great
masters
of
music
to
choose
it
as
their
favourite
instrument
it
may
be
mentioned
at
this
point
that
the
piano
did
not
have
the
effect
of
impairing
the
orchestration
of
the
great
composers
as
some
musical
wiseacres
assert
from
time
to
time
for
they
have
written
just
as
fine
works
for
a
variety
of
other
instruments
not
to
speak
of
their
symphonies
thus
has
for
instance
the
most
substantial
part
of
the
violin
literature
been
contributed
by
bach
mozart
beethoven
mendelssohn
brahms
bruch
tschaikowski
and
many
others
as
to
the
literature
of
the
orchestra
it
came
almost
exclusively
from
those
masters
whose
only
or
chiefest
medium
of
musical
utterance
was
the
piano
highly
organised
natures
as
they
were
they
liked
to
dress
their
thoughts
sometimes
in
the
colour
splendour
of
the
orchestra
looking
at
the
depth
of
their
piano
works
however
at
their
sterling
merit
at
their
poetry
i
feel
that
even
a
refined
musical
nature
may
find
lifelong
contentment
in
the
piano
despite
its
limitations
if
as
i
said
before
the
artist
keeps
within
its
boundaries
and
commands
its
possibilities
for
it
is
after
all
not
so
very
little
that
the
piano
has
to
offer
it
is
both
governed
and
manipulated
by
one
and
the
same
mind
and
person
its
mechanism
is
so
fine
and
yet
so
simple
as
to
make
its
tone
response
quite
as
direct
as
that
of
any
other
stringed
instrument
it
admits
of
the
thoroughly
personal
element
of
touch
it
requires
no
auxiliary
instruments
for
even
in
the
concerto
the
orchestra
is
not
a
mere
accompanist
but
an
equal
partner
as
the
name
concerto
implies
its
limitations
are
not
as
bad
as
those
of
some
other
instruments
or
of
the
voice
it
outweighs
these
limitations
very
fairly
by
the
vast
wealth
of
its
dynamic
and
touch
varieties
considering
all
these
and
many
other
points
of
merit
i
think
that
a
musician
may
be
pretty
well
satisfied
with
being
a
pianist
his
realm
is
in
more
than
one
respect
smaller
than
that
of
the
conductor
to
be
sure
but
on
the
other
hand
the
conductor
loses
many
lovely
moments
of
sweet
intimacy
which
are
granted
to
the
pianist
when
and
alone
with
his
instrument
he
can
commune
with
his
innermost
and
best
self
consecrated
moments
these
which
he
would
exchange
with
no
musician
of
any
other
type
and
which
wealth
can
neither
buy
nor
power
compel
the
piano
and
the
player
music
makers
are
like
the
rest
of
mankind
not
free
from
sin
on
the
whole
however
i
think
that
the
transgressions
of
pianists
against
the
canons
of
art
are
less
grave
and
less
frequent
than
those
of
other
music
makers
perhaps
because
they
are
usually
better
grounded
as
musicians
than
are
singers
and
such
players
of
other
instruments
as
the
public
places
on
a
par
with
the
pianists
i
have
in
mind
but
while
their
sins
may
be
less
in
number
and
gravity
let
it
be
well
understood
that
the
pianists
are
no
saints
alas
no
it
is
rather
strange
though
that
their
worst
misdeeds
are
induced
by
that
very
virtue
of
the
piano
of
requiring
no
auxiliary
instruments
of
being
independent
if
it
were
not
so
if
the
pianist
were
compelled
always
to
play
in
company
with
other
musicians
these
other
players
might
at
times
differ
with
him
as
to
conception
tempo
and
their
views
and
wishes
should
have
to
be
reckoned
with
for
the
sake
of
both
equilibrium
and
sweet
peace
left
entirely
to
himself
however
as
the
pianist
usually
is
in
his
performances
he
sometimes
yields
to
a
tendency
to
move
altogether
too
freely
to
forget
the
deference
due
to
the
composition
and
its
creator
and
to
allow
his
individuality
to
glitter
with
a
false
and
presumptuous
brightness
such
a
pianist
does
not
only
fail
in
his
mission
as
an
interpreter
but
he
also
misjudges
the
possibilities
of
the
piano
he
will
for
instance
try
to
produce
six
when
the
piano
has
not
more
than
three
to
give
all
told
except
at
a
sacrifice
of
its
dignity
and
its
specific
charm
the
extremest
contrasts
the
greatest
and
the
finest
are
given
factors
determined
by
the
individual
piano
by
the
skill
of
touch
and
by
the
acoustic
properties
of
the
hall
these
given
factors
the
pianist
must
bear
in
mind
as
well
as
the
limitations
of
the
piano
as
to
colour
if
he
means
to
keep
clear
of
dilettanteism
and
charlatanry
a
nice
appreciation
of
the
realm
over
which
he
rules
as
to
its
boundaries
and
possibilities
must
be
the
supreme
endeavour
of
every
sovereign
hence
also
of
every
sovereign
musician
now
i
hear
it
so
often
said
of
this
and
that
pianist
that
he
plays
with
much
feeling
that
i
can
not
help
wondering
if
he
does
not
sometimes
at
least
play
with
much
feeling
where
it
is
not
in
the
least
called
for
and
where
much
feeling
constitutes
a
decided
trespass
against
the
æsthetic
boundaries
of
the
composition
my
apprehension
is
usually
well
founded
for
the
pianist
that
plays
with
so
much
feeling
is
an
artist
in
name
only
but
in
reality
a
sentimentalist
if
not
a
vulgar
sensationalist
or
a
ranter
upon
the
keyboard
what
sane
pianist
would
for
instance
attempt
to
play
a
cantilena
with
the
same
appealing
sensuousness
as
the
most
mediocre
can
do
with
the
greatest
ease
yet
many
pianists
attempt
it
but
since
they
are
fully
aware
that
they
can
never
attain
such
ends
by
legitimate
artistic
means
they
make
either
the
accompaniment
or
the
rhythm
if
not
the
phrasing
bear
the
brunt
of
their
palpable
dilettanteism
of
such
illusory
endeavours
i
can
not
warn
too
strongly
for
they
are
bound
to
destroy
the
organic
relation
of
the
melody
to
its
auxiliaries
and
to
change
the
musical
physiognomy
of
a
piece
into
a
grimace
this
fault
reveals
that
the
spirit
of
adventure
is
too
willing
but
the
flesh
of
the
fingers
and
their
technic
too
weak
the
artistic
and
the
dilettantic
manners
of
expression
must
be
sharply
differentiated
they
differ
principally
as
follows
the
artist
knows
and
feels
how
far
the
responsiveness
of
his
instrument
at
any
particular
part
of
his
piece
will
allow
him
to
go
without
violating
æsthetics
and
without
stepping
outside
of
the
nature
of
his
instrument
he
shapes
his
rendition
of
the
piece
accordingly
and
practises
wise
economy
in
the
use
of
force
and
in
the
display
of
feeling
as
to
feeling
it
is
the
ripe
product
of
a
multitude
of
æsthetic
processes
which
the
moment
creates
and
develops
but
the
artist
will
keep
this
product
from
asserting
itself
until
he
has
complied
with
every
requirement
of
artistic
until
he
has
so
to
speak
provided
a
cleanly
covered
and
fully
set
table
upon
which
these
matters
of
feeling
appear
as
finishing
decorative
touches
say
as
flowers
the
dilettante
on
the
other
hand
does
not
consume
any
time
by
thinking
and
planning
he
simply
goes
for
his
piece
and
without
bothering
about
workmanship
or
squirming
around
it
as
best
he
may
he
rambles
off
into
feeling
which
in
his
case
consists
of
naught
but
vague
formless
aimless
and
purely
sensuous
sentimentality
his
accompaniment
drowns
the
melody
his
rhythm
goes
on
a
sympathetic
strike
dynamic
and
other
artistic
properties
become
hysterical
no
matter
he
feels
he
builds
a
house
in
which
the
cellar
is
under
the
roof
and
the
garret
in
the
basement
let
it
be
said
in
extenuation
of
such
a
player
that
he
is
not
always
and
seldom
wholly
to
blame
for
his
very
often
he
strays
from
the
path
of
musical
rectitude
because
of
his
misplaced
trust
in
the
judgment
of
others
which
causes
him
to
accept
and
follow
advice
in
good
faith
instead
of
duly
considering
its
source
for
under
certain
conditions
the
advice
of
even
a
connoisseur
may
be
wrong
many
professional
and
critics
for
instance
fall
into
the
bad
habit
of
expecting
that
a
pianist
should
tell
all
he
knows
in
every
piece
he
plays
whether
the
piano
does
or
does
not
furnish
the
opportunities
for
displaying
all
his
qualities
they
expect
him
to
show
strength
temperament
passion
poise
sentiment
repose
depth
and
so
forth
in
the
first
piece
on
his
programme
he
must
tell
his
whole
story
present
himself
at
once
as
a
giant
or
titan
of
the
piano
though
the
piece
may
call
for
naught
but
tenderness
with
this
demand
or
the
alternative
of
a
roasting
public
artists
are
confronted
rather
frequently
nor
is
this
perhaps
as
much
the
fault
of
the
critic
as
of
the
conditions
under
which
they
must
write
from
my
own
experience
and
that
of
others
i
know
that
the
critics
in
large
cities
are
so
overburdened
with
work
during
the
season
that
they
have
seldom
time
to
listen
to
more
than
one
piece
out
of
a
whole
recital
programme
after
such
a
mere
sample
they
form
their
opinions
so
momentous
for
the
career
of
a
young
pianist
and
if
this
one
piece
happened
to
offer
no
opportunities
to
the
pianist
to
show
himself
as
the
great
why
then
he
is
simply
put
down
as
one
of
the
littlefellows
it
is
no
wonder
that
such
conditions
tempt
many
young
aspirants
to
public
renown
to
resort
to
æsthetic
violence
in
order
to
make
sure
of
good
notices
to
use
power
where
it
is
not
called
for
to
make
feeling
ooze
from
every
pore
to
double
treble
the
tempo
or
vacillate
it
out
of
all
rhythm
to
violate
the
boundaries
of
both
the
composition
and
the
instrument
and
all
this
for
no
other
purpose
than
to
show
as
quickly
as
possible
that
the
various
qualities
are
all
there
these
conditions
produce
what
may
be
called
the
pianistic
or
parvenu
who
practises
the
vices
of
the
dilettante
without
however
the
mitigating
excuse
of
ignorance
or
a
lack
of
training
the
pianist
and
the
composition
as
the
piano
so
has
also
every
composition
its
limitations
as
to
the
range
of
its
emotions
and
their
artistic
expression
the
hints
in
this
direction
i
threw
out
before
may
now
be
amplified
by
discussing
a
very
common
error
which
underlies
the
matter
of
conception
it
is
the
error
of
inferring
the
conception
of
a
composition
the
name
of
its
of
thinking
that
beethoven
has
to
be
played
thus
and
chopin
thus
no
error
could
be
greater
true
every
great
composer
has
his
own
style
his
habitual
mode
of
thought
development
his
personality
revealing
lines
but
it
is
equally
true
that
the
imagination
of
all
great
composers
was
strong
enough
to
absorb
them
as
completely
in
their
own
creation
as
the
late
pygmalion
was
absorbed
in
his
galatea
and
to
lure
them
for
the
time
being
completely
away
from
their
habits
of
thought
and
expression
they
become
the
willing
servants
of
the
new
creature
of
their
own
fancy
thus
we
find
some
of
beethoven
works
as
romantic
and
fanciful
as
any
of
schumann
or
chopin
could
be
while
some
of
the
latter
works
show
at
times
a
good
deal
of
beethovenish
classicity
it
is
therefore
utterly
wrong
to
approach
every
work
of
beethoven
with
the
preconceived
idea
that
it
must
be
deep
and
majestic
or
if
the
work
be
chopin
that
it
must
run
over
with
sensuousness
and
feeling
how
would
such
a
style
of
rendition
do
for
instance
for
the
polonaise
op
or
even
for
the
little
one
in
a
op
no
on
the
other
hand
how
would
the
stereotype
academic
manner
of
playing
beethoven
suit
his
concerto
in
g
that
poetic
presage
of
chopin
every
great
master
has
written
some
works
that
are
and
some
that
are
not
typical
of
himself
in
the
latter
cases
the
master
identity
reveals
itself
only
to
an
eye
that
is
experienced
enough
to
detect
it
in
the
smaller
more
minute
traits
of
his
style
such
delicate
features
however
must
be
left
in
their
discreet
nooks
and
niches
they
must
not
be
clumsily
dragged
into
the
foreground
for
the
sake
of
a
traditional
rendition
of
the
piece
that
sort
of
reverence
is
bound
to
obliterate
all
the
peculiarities
of
the
particular
composition
it
is
not
reverence
but
fetichism
justice
to
the
composer
means
justice
to
his
works
to
every
work
in
particular
and
this
justice
we
can
not
learn
from
the
reading
of
his
biography
but
by
regarding
every
one
of
his
works
as
a
separate
and
complete
entity
as
a
perfect
organic
whole
of
which
we
must
study
the
general
character
the
special
features
the
form
the
manner
of
design
the
emotional
course
and
the
trend
of
thought
much
more
than
by
his
biography
we
will
be
helped
in
forming
our
conception
by
comparing
the
work
in
hand
with
others
of
the
same
master
though
the
comparison
may
disclose
just
as
many
differences
of
style
as
it
may
show
similarities
the
worship
of
names
the
unquestioning
acquiescence
in
traditional
conceptions
those
are
not
the
principles
which
will
lead
an
artist
to
come
into
his
own
it
is
rather
a
close
examination
of
every
popular
notion
a
severe
testing
of
every
tradition
by
the
touchstone
of
that
will
help
an
artist
to
find
himself
and
to
see
what
he
does
see
with
his
own
eyes
thus
we
find
that
in
a
certain
constructive
meaning
even
the
reverence
for
the
composer
is
not
without
boundaries
though
these
boundary
lines
are
drawn
here
only
to
secure
the
widest
possible
freedom
for
their
work
goethe
great
word
expresses
most
tersely
what
i
mean
outwardly
limited
boundless
to
inward
general
rules
successful
if
it
can
not
be
entirely
acquired
by
some
very
simple
rules
can
at
least
be
very
much
helped
by
what
will
seem
to
some
as
contributing
causes
so
slight
as
to
be
hardly
worth
notice
still
they
are
immensely
valuable
and
i
will
endeavour
to
set
down
a
few
value
of
the
morning
above
any
other
time
is
not
generally
appreciated
the
mental
freshness
gained
from
sleep
is
a
tremendous
help
i
go
so
far
as
to
say
play
away
for
an
hour
or
a
half
hour
even
before
breakfast
but
before
you
touch
the
piano
let
me
suggest
one
very
prosaic
little
hint
wash
the
keyboard
as
clean
as
you
did
your
hands
eating
always
tastes
best
from
a
clean
table
just
so
with
the
piano
you
can
not
do
clean
work
on
an
unclean
keyboard
as
to
let
me
suggest
that
you
never
practise
more
than
an
hour
or
at
the
most
two
hours
at
a
stretch
according
to
your
condition
and
strength
then
go
out
and
take
a
walk
and
think
no
more
of
music
this
method
of
mental
unhitching
so
to
speak
is
absolutely
necessary
in
order
that
the
newly
acquired
results
of
your
work
may
unconsciously
to
yourself
mature
in
your
mind
and
get
as
it
were
into
your
flesh
and
blood
that
which
you
have
newly
learned
must
become
affixed
to
your
entire
organism
very
much
like
the
picture
on
a
photographic
plate
is
developed
and
affixed
by
the
silver
bath
if
you
allow
nature
no
time
for
this
work
the
result
of
your
previous
efforts
will
vanish
and
you
will
have
to
begin
all
over
again
with
your
photographing
yes
photographing
for
every
acoustic
or
tone
picture
is
through
the
agency
of
the
ear
photographed
in
the
brain
and
the
whole
occupation
of
the
pianist
consists
in
the
reproduction
of
the
previously
received
impressions
through
the
fingers
which
with
the
help
of
the
instrument
retranslate
the
pictures
into
audible
tones
after
every
half
hour
make
a
pause
until
you
feel
rested
five
minutes
will
often
be
sufficient
follow
the
example
of
the
painter
who
closes
his
eyes
for
a
few
moments
in
order
to
obtain
upon
reopening
them
a
fresh
color
impression
valuable
little
hint
if
you
will
allow
me
watch
well
that
you
actually
hear
every
tone
you
mean
to
produce
every
missing
tone
will
mean
a
blotch
upon
your
photographic
plate
in
the
brain
each
note
must
be
not
mentally
but
physically
heard
and
to
this
imperative
requirement
your
speed
must
ever
subordinate
itself
it
is
not
at
all
necessary
to
practise
loudly
in
order
to
foster
the
permanence
of
impressions
rather
let
an
inward
tension
take
the
place
of
external
force
it
will
engage
sympathetically
your
hearing
just
as
well
to
the
great
energy
great
results
i
prefer
my
amended
version
great
energy
restrained
power
and
moderate
manifestation
of
it
prepare
the
finger
for
great
force
imagine
the
tone
as
being
strong
and
yet
strike
moderately
continuous
loud
playing
makes
our
playing
coarse
on
the
other
hand
continuous
soft
playing
will
blur
the
tone
picture
in
our
mind
and
cause
us
soon
to
play
insecurely
and
wrongly
from
time
to
time
we
should
of
course
practise
loudly
so
as
to
develop
physical
endurance
but
for
the
greater
part
of
practice
i
recommend
playing
with
restrained
power
and
incidentally
your
neighbours
will
thank
you
for
it
too
not
practise
or
methodically
as
it
is
sometimes
called
systematism
is
the
death
of
spontaneousness
and
spontaneousness
is
the
very
soul
of
art
if
you
play
every
day
at
the
same
time
the
same
sequence
of
the
same
studies
and
the
same
pieces
you
may
acquire
a
certain
degree
of
skill
perhaps
but
the
spontaneity
of
your
rendition
will
surely
be
lost
art
belongs
to
the
realm
of
emotional
manifestations
and
it
stands
to
reason
that
a
systematic
exploiting
of
our
emotional
nature
must
blunt
it
regard
to
finger
do
not
let
them
be
too
frequent
or
too
long
at
the
most
a
half
hour
a
day
a
half
hour
daily
kept
up
for
a
year
is
enough
for
any
one
to
learn
to
play
one
exercises
and
if
one
can
play
them
why
should
one
keep
everlastingly
on
playing
them
can
anybody
explain
without
reflecting
upon
one
sanity
why
one
should
persist
in
playing
them
i
suggest
to
use
these
exercises
as
preliminary
warmers
as
practised
in
engines
as
soon
as
the
hands
have
become
warm
and
elastic
or
pliable
played
in
as
we
pianists
say
drop
the
exercises
and
repeat
them
for
the
same
purpose
the
next
morning
if
you
will
they
can
be
successfully
substituted
however
as
compositions
they
are
but
lukewarm
water
if
you
will
dip
your
hands
instead
for
five
minutes
into
hot
water
you
will
follow
my
own
method
and
find
it
just
as
efficacious
rule
for
memory
if
you
wish
to
strengthen
the
receptivity
and
retentiveness
of
your
memory
you
will
find
the
following
plan
practical
start
with
a
short
piece
analyse
the
form
and
manner
of
its
texture
play
the
piece
a
number
of
times
very
exactly
with
the
music
before
you
then
stop
playing
for
several
hours
and
try
to
trace
the
course
of
ideas
mentally
in
the
piece
try
to
hear
the
piece
inwardly
if
you
have
retained
some
parts
refill
the
missing
places
by
repeated
reading
of
the
piece
away
from
the
piano
when
next
you
go
to
the
piano
after
several
hours
remember
try
to
play
the
piece
should
you
still
get
stuck
at
a
certain
place
take
the
sheet
music
but
play
only
that
place
several
times
if
necessary
and
then
begin
the
piece
over
again
as
a
test
if
you
have
better
luck
this
time
with
those
elusive
places
if
you
still
fail
resume
your
silent
reading
of
the
piece
away
from
the
piano
under
no
circumstances
skip
the
unsafe
place
for
the
time
being
and
proceed
with
the
rest
of
the
piece
by
such
forcing
of
the
memory
you
lose
the
logical
development
of
your
piece
tangle
up
your
memory
and
injure
its
receptivity
another
observation
in
connection
with
memorising
may
find
a
place
here
when
we
study
a
piece
we
unconsciously
associate
in
our
mind
a
multitude
of
things
with
it
which
bear
not
the
slightest
relation
upon
it
by
these
things
i
mean
not
only
the
action
of
the
piano
light
or
heavy
as
it
may
be
but
also
the
colour
of
its
wood
the
colour
of
the
wall
paper
discoloration
of
the
ivory
on
some
key
of
the
piano
the
pictures
on
the
walls
the
angle
at
which
the
piano
stands
to
the
architectural
lines
of
the
room
in
short
all
sorts
of
things
and
we
remain
utterly
unconscious
of
having
associated
them
with
the
piece
we
are
studying
until
we
try
to
play
the
piece
in
a
different
place
in
the
house
of
a
friend
or
if
we
are
inexperienced
enough
to
commit
such
a
blunder
in
the
concert
hall
then
we
find
that
our
memory
fails
us
most
unexpectedly
and
we
blame
our
memory
for
its
unreliableness
but
the
fact
is
rather
that
our
memory
was
only
too
good
too
exact
for
the
absence
of
or
difference
from
our
accustomed
surroundings
disturbed
our
too
precise
memory
hence
to
make
absolutely
sure
of
our
memory
we
should
try
our
piece
in
a
number
of
different
places
before
relying
upon
our
memory
this
will
dissociate
the
wonted
environment
from
the
piece
in
our
memory
regard
to
technical
play
good
compositions
and
construe
out
of
them
your
own
technical
exercises
in
nearly
every
piece
you
play
you
will
find
a
place
or
two
of
which
your
conscience
tells
you
that
they
are
not
up
to
your
own
wishes
that
they
can
be
improved
upon
either
from
a
rhythmical
dynamical
or
precisional
point
of
view
give
these
places
the
preference
for
a
while
but
do
not
fail
to
play
from
time
to
time
again
the
whole
piece
in
order
to
put
the
erstwhile
defective
and
now
repaired
part
into
proper
relation
to
its
context
remember
that
a
difficult
part
may
go
pretty
well
when
severed
from
its
context
and
yet
fail
utterly
when
attempted
in
its
proper
place
you
must
follow
the
mechanic
in
this
if
a
part
of
a
machine
is
perfected
in
the
shop
it
must
still
go
through
the
process
of
being
mounted
that
is
being
brought
into
proper
relation
to
the
machine
itself
and
this
often
requires
additional
packing
or
filing
as
the
case
may
be
this
mounting
of
a
repaired
part
is
done
best
by
playing
it
in
conjunction
with
one
preceding
and
one
following
measure
then
put
two
measures
on
each
side
three
four
until
you
feel
your
ground
safely
under
your
fingers
not
until
then
have
you
achieved
your
purpose
of
technical
practice
the
mere
mastering
of
a
difficulty
is
no
guarantee
of
success
whatever
many
students
play
certain
compositions
for
years
and
yet
when
they
are
asked
to
play
them
the
evidences
of
imperfection
are
so
palpable
that
they
can
not
have
finished
the
learning
of
them
the
strong
probability
is
that
they
never
will
finish
the
study
of
them
because
they
do
not
study
right
to
the
number
of
the
larger
the
number
of
good
compositions
you
are
able
to
play
in
a
finished
manner
the
better
grow
your
opportunities
to
develop
your
versatility
of
style
for
in
almost
every
good
composition
you
will
find
some
traits
peculiar
to
itself
only
which
demand
an
equally
special
treatment
to
keep
as
many
pieces
as
possible
in
your
memory
and
in
good
technical
condition
play
them
a
few
times
each
week
do
not
play
them
however
in
consecutive
repetitions
take
one
after
the
other
after
the
last
piece
is
played
the
first
one
will
appear
fresh
again
to
your
mind
this
process
i
have
tested
and
found
very
helpful
in
maintaining
a
large
repertory
illustration
position
of
the

the
that
is
move
your
arms
as
little
as
possible
and
hold
them
and
the
shoulder
muscles
quite
loosely
the
hands
should
be
nearly
horizontal
with
a
slight
inclination
from
the
elbows
toward
the
keys
bend
the
fingers
gently
and
endeavour
to
touch
the
keys
in
their
centre
and
with
the
tips
of
the
fingers
this
will
tend
toward
sureness
and
give
eyes
to
your
fingers
so
to
speak
practice
of
finger
play
octaves
first
as
if
you
were
playing
single
notes
with
one
finger
of
each
hand
lift
the
thumb
and
fifth
finger
rather
high
and
let
them
fall
upon
the
keys
without
using
the
wrist
later
let
the
wrist
come
to
your
aid
sometimes
even
the
arm
and
shoulder
muscles
though
the
latter
should
both
be
reserved
for
places
requiring
great
power
where
powerful
octaves
occur
in
long
continuation
it
is
best
to
distribute
the
work
over
the
joints
and
muscles
of
the
fingers
wrists
and
shoulders
with
a
rational
distribution
each
of
the
joints
will
avoid
and
the
player
will
gain
in
endurance
this
applies
of
course
only
to
bravura
passages
in
places
where
musical
characteristics
predominate
the
player
does
best
to
choose
whichever
of
these
sources
of
touch
seems
most
appropriate
illustration
way
to

an

way

position
of
little

the
beware
of
too
frequent
and
above
all
of
use
of
the

it
is
the
mortal
enemy
of
clarity
judiciously
however
you
should
use
it
when
you
study
a
new
work
for
if
you
accustom
yourself
to
play
a
work
without
the
pedal
the
habit
of
will
grow
upon
you
and
you
will
be
surprised
to
find
later
how
your
feet
can
be
in
the
way
of
your
fingers
do
not
delay
the
use
of
the
pedal
as
if
it
were
the
dessert
after
a
repast
play
with
a
you
may
use
a
metronome
for
a
little
passage
as
a
test
of
your
ability
to
play
the
passage
in
strict
time
when
you
see
the
result
positive
or
negative
stop
the
machine
at
once
for
according
to
the
metronome
a
really
musical
rhythm
is
unrhythmical
and
on
the
other
hand
the
keeping
of
absolutely
strict
time
is
thoroughly
unmusical
and
deadlike
you
should
endeavour
to
reproduce
the
of
the
time
which
a
musical
thought
occupies
within
its
scope
however
you
must
vary
your
beats
in
accordance
with
their
musical
significance
this
constitutes
in
musical
interpretation
what
i
call
the
individual
which
imparts
life
to
the
dead
black
notes
beware
however
of
being
too
individual
avoid
exaggeration
or
else
your
patient
will
grow
feverish
and
all
æsthetic
interpretation
goes
to
the
happy
hunting
grounds
correct
posture
at
the
sit
straight
before
the
piano
but
not
stiff
have
both
feet
upon
the
pedals
so
as
to
be
at
any
moment
ready
to
use
them
all
other
manners
to
keep
the
feet
are
bad
manners
let
your
hand
fall
with
the
arm
upon
the
keyboard
when
you
start
a
phrase
and
observe
a
certain
roundness
in
all
the
motions
of
your
arms
and
hands
avoid
angles
and
sharp
bends
for
they
produce
strong
frictions
in
the
joints
which
means
a
waste
of
force
and
is
bound
to
cause
premature
fatigue
not
attend
poor
do
not
believe
that
you
can
learn
correct
vision
from
the
blind
nor
that
you
can
really
profit
by
hearing
how
a
piece
should
be
played
and
then
trying
the
reverse
the
danger
of
getting
accustomed
to
poor
playing
is
very
great
what
would
you
think
of
a
parent
who
deliberately
sent
his
child
into
bad
company
in
order
that
such
child
should
learn
how
to
behave
such
experiments
are
dangerous
by
attending
poor
concerts
you
encourage
the
bungler
to
continue
in
his
crimes
against
good
taste
and
artistic
decency
and
you
become
his
accomplice
besides
you
help
to
lower
the
standard
of
appreciation
in
your
community
which
may
sink
so
low
that
good
concerts
will
cease
to
be
patronised
if
you
desire
that
good
concerts
should
be
given
in
your
city
the
least
you
can
do
is
to
withhold
your
patronage
from
bad
ones
if
you
are
doubtful
as
to
the
merits
of
a
proposed
concert
ask
your
own
or
your
children
music
teacher
he
will
appreciate
your
confidence
and
be
glad
of
the
opportunity
to
serve
you
for
once
in
a
musical
matter
that
lies
on
a
higher
plane
than
your
own
or
your
children
music
lesson
those
who
play
in
i
should
like
to
say
this
before
you
have
played
a
composition
in
public
two
or
three
times
you
must
not
expect
that
every
detail
of
it
shall
go
according
to
your
wishes
do
not
be
surprised
at
little
unexpected
occurrences
consider
that
the
acoustic
properties
of
the
various
halls
constitute
a
serious
danger
to
the
musician
bad
humor
on
your
part
or
a
slight
indisposition
even
a
clamlike
audience
puritanically
austere
or
cool
from
diffidence
all
these
things
can
be
overcome
but
the
acoustic
properties
remain
the
same
from
the
beginning
of
your
programme
to
its
end
and
if
they
are
not
a
kindly
counsellor
they
turn
into
a
fiendish
demon
who
sneers
to
death
your
every
effort
to
produce
pictures
therefore
try
to
ascertain
as
early
as
possible
what
sort
of
an
architectural
stomach
your
musical
feast
is
to
fill
and
then
well
do
the
best
you
can
approach
the
picture
you
hold
in
your
mind
as
nearly
as
circumstances
permit
i
find
bad
acoustics
in
a
an
important
medium
of
rectifying
the
acoustic
misbehaviour
of
a
hall
i
have
found
in
the
pedal
in
some
halls
my
piano
has
sounded
as
if
i
had
planted
my
feet
on
the
pedal
for
good
and
ever
in
such
cases
i
practised
the
greatest
abstention
from
pedalling
it
is
a
fact
that
we
have
to
treat
the
pedal
differently
in
almost
every
hall
to
insure
the
same
results
i
know
that
a
number
of
books
have
been
written
on
the
use
of
the
pedal
but
they
are
theories
which
tumble
down
before
the
first
adverse
experience
on
the
legitimate
concert
stage
there
you
can
lean
on
nothing
but
experience
reading
books
on
and
speaking
of
books
on
music
let
me
advise
you
to
read
them
but
not
to
believe
them
unless
they
support
every
statement
with
an
argument
and
unless
this
argument
succeeds
in
convincing
you
in
art
we
deal
far
oftener
with
exceptions
than
with
rules
and
laws
every
genius
in
art
has
demonstrated
in
his
works
the
forefeeling
of
new
laws
and
every
succeeding
one
has
done
by
his
precursors
as
his
successors
have
in
their
turn
done
by
him
hence
all
theorising
in
art
must
be
problematic
and
precarious
while
dogmatising
in
art
amounts
to
absurdity
music
is
a
language
the
language
of
the
musical
whatever
and
wherever
be
their
country
let
each
one
then
speak
in
his
own
way
as
he
thinks
and
feels
provided
he
is
sincere
tolstoi
put
the
whole
thing
so
well
when
he
said
there
are
only
three
things
of
real
importance
in
the
world
they
are
sincerity
sincerity
sincerity
correct
touch
and
technic
great
finger
technic
may
be
defined
as
extreme
precision
and
great
speed
in
the
action
of
the
fingers
the
latter
quality
however
can
never
be
developed
without
the
legato
touch
i
am
convinced
that
the
degree
of
perfection
of
finger
technic
is
exactly
proportionate
to
the
development
of
the
legato
touch
the
process
of
the
touch
by
showing
contrary
results
will
bear
me
out
to
play
a
rapid
run
will
consume
much
more
time
than
to
play
it
legato
because
of
the
lifting
of
the
fingers
between
the
tones
in
playing
legato
the
fingers
are
not
lifted
off
the
keys
but
hardly
losing
contact
with
the
ivory
glide
sideways
to
the
right
or
the
left
as
the
notes
may
call
for
it
this
naturally
saves
both
time
and
exertion
and
thus
allows
an
increase
of
speed
how
is
the
true
legato
accomplished
by
the
gliding
motion
just
mentioned
and
by
touching
the
next
following
key
before
the
finger
which
played
last
has
fully
abandoned
its
key
to
illustrate
let
me
say
that
in
a
run
of
single
notes
two
fingers
are
simultaneously
at
work
the
played
and
the
playing
one
in
runs
of
double
notes
thirds
sixths
etc
the
number
of
simultaneously
employed
fingers
is
analogously
four
only
in
this
manner
is
a
true
legato
touch
to
be
attained
while
the
fingers
are
in
action
the
hand
must
not
move
lest
it
produce
gaps
between
the
succeeding
tones
causing
not
only
a
breaking
of
the
connection
between
them
but
also
a
lessening
of
speed
the
transfer
of
the
hand
should
take
place
only
when
the
finger
is
already
in
touch
with
the
key
that
is
to
follow
not
at
the
time
of
contact
still
less
before
the
selection
of
a
practical
fingering
is
of
course
of
paramount
importance
for
a
good
legato
touch
in
attempting
a
run
without
a
good
fingering
we
will
soon
find
ourselves
out
of
fingers
in
that
emergency
we
should
have
to
resort
to
piecing
on
and
this
means
a
jerk
at
every
instance
equal
to
a
a
correct
fingering
is
one
which
permits
the
longest
natural
sequel
of
fingers
to
be
used
without
a
break
by
earnest
thinking
every
player
can
contrive
the
fingering
that
will
prove
most
convenient
to
him
but
admitting
that
the
great
diversity
of
hands
prohibits
a
universal
fingering
all
the
varieties
of
fingering
ought
to
be
based
upon
the
principle
of
a
natural
sequel
if
a
player
be
puzzled
by
certain
configurations
of
notes
and
keys
as
to
the
best
fingering
for
them
he
ought
to
consult
a
teacher
who
if
a
good
one
will
gladly
help
him
out
precision
the
other
component
part
of
finger
technic
is
intimately
related
with
the
player
general
sense
of
orderliness
as
a
matter
of
fact
precision
is
orderliness
in
the
technical
execution
of
a
musical
prescription
if
the
student
will
but
look
quite
closely
at
the
piece
he
is
learning
if
he
has
the
patience
to
repeat
a
difficult
place
in
it
a
hundred
times
if
necessary
and
correctly
of
course
he
will
soon
acquire
the
trait
of
precision
and
he
will
experience
the
resultant
increase
in
his
technical
ability
mental
technic
presupposes
the
ability
to
form
a
clear
inward
conception
of
a
run
without
resorting
to
the
fingers
at
all
since
every
action
of
a
finger
has
first
to
be
determined
upon
by
the
mind
a
run
should
be
completely
prepared
mentally
before
it
is
tried
on
the
piano
in
other
words
the
student
should
strive
to
acquire
the
ability
to
form
the
tonal
picture
in
his
mind
rather
than
the
note
picture
the
tonal
picture
dwells
in
our
imagination
this
acts
upon
the
responsive
portions
of
the
brain
influences
them
according
to
its
own
intensity
and
this
influence
is
then
transferred
to
the
motoric
which
are
concerned
in
as
far
as
known
this
is
the
course
by
which
the
musician
converts
his
musical
concept
into
a
tonal
reality
hence
when
studying
a
new
work
it
is
imperative
that
a
tonal
picture
of
perfect
clarity
should
be
prepared
in
the
mind
before
the
mechanical
or
technical
practicing
begins
in
the
earlier
stages
of
cultivating
this
trait
it
will
be
best
to
ask
the
teacher
to
play
the
piece
for
us
and
thus
to
help
us
in
forming
a
correct
tonal
picture
in
our
mind
the
blurring
of
the
tonal
picture
produces
a
temporary
do
get
frightened
paralysis
of
the
motoric
centres
which
control
the
fingers
every
pianist
knows
unfortunately
the
sensation
of
having
his
fingers
begin
to
stick
as
if
the
keys
were
covered
with
flypaper
and
he
knows
also
that
this
sensation
is
but
a
warning
that
the
fingers
are
going
on
a
general
and
even
sympathetic
strike
sympathetic
because
even
the
momentarily
unconcerned
fingers
participate
in
it
now
the
cause
of
this
sensation
lies
not
in
a
defective
action
of
the
fingers
themselves
but
solely
in
the
mind
it
is
there
that
some
undesired
change
has
taken
place
a
change
which
impairs
the
action
of
the
fingers
the
process
is
like
this
by
quick
repetitions
of
complicated
figures
slight
errors
slips
flaws
escape
our
notice
the
more
quick
repetitions
we
make
the
larger
will
be
the
number
of
these
tiny
blots
and
this
must
needs
lead
finally
to
a
completely
distorted
tonal
picture
this
distortion
however
is
not
the
worst
feature
inasmuch
as
we
are
very
likely
not
to
make
the
same
little
blunders
at
every
repetition
the
tonal
picture
becomes
confused
blurred
the
nerve
contacts
which
cause
the
fingers
to
act
become
undecided
first
then
they
begin
to
fail
more
and
more
until
they
cease
altogether
and
the
fingers
stick
at
such
a
juncture
the
student
should
at
once
resort
to
slow
practice
he
should
play
the
defective
place
clearly
orderly
and
above
all
slowly
and
persist
in
this
course
until
the
number
of
correct
repetitions
proves
sufficient
to
crowd
the
confused
tonal
picture
out
of
the
mind
this
is
not
to
be
regarded
as
mechanical
practice
for
it
is
intended
for
the
rehabilitation
of
a
disarranged
or
disturbed
mental
concept
i
trust
this
will
speak
for
the
practice
of
what
i
called
mental
technic
make
the
mental
tonal
picture
sharp
the
fingers
must
and
will
obey
it
illustration
position
of
illustration
position
of
we
are
sometimes
affected
by
i
translate
this
word
literally
from
other
languages
because
it
is
a
good
compound
for
which
i
can
find
no
better
equivalent
in
english
whenever
we
find
the
fingers
going
astray
in
the
piece
we
play
we
might
as
well
admit
to
ourselves
that
the
trouble
is
in
the
main
office
the
mysterious
controlling
officer
has
been
talking
with
a
friend
instead
of
attending
to
business
the
mind
was
not
keeping
step
with
the
fingers
we
have
relied
on
our
automatism
we
allowed
the
fingers
to
run
on
and
the
mind
lagged
behind
instead
of
being
as
it
should
be
ahead
of
the
fingers
preparing
their
work
quick
musical
thinking
the
importance
of
which
is
thus
apparent
can
not
be
developed
by
any
direct
course
it
is
one
of
the
of
the
general
widening
of
one
musical
horizon
it
is
ever
proportionate
to
the
growth
of
one
other
musical
faculties
it
is
the
result
of
elasticity
of
the
mind
acquired
or
developed
by
constant
unremitting
employment
whenever
we
are
at
the
piano
a
procedure
tending
directly
toward
developing
quick
musical
thinking
is
therefore
not
necessary
the
musical
will
has
its
roots
in
the
natural
craving
for
musical
utterance
it
is
the
of
all
that
is
musical
in
us
hence
i
recognise
in
the
purely
technical
processes
of
no
less
a
manifestation
of
the
musical
will
but
a
technic
without
a
musical
will
is
a
faculty
without
a
purpose
and
when
it
becomes
a
purpose
in
itself
it
can
never
serve
art
the
use
of
the
pedal
to
speak
in
a
concrete
manner
of
the
pedal
is
possible
only
on
the
basis
of
a
complete
understanding
of
the
fundamental
principle
underlying
its
use
the
reader
must
agree
to
the
governing
theory
that
the
organ
which
governs
the
employment
of
the
pedal
is
the
ear
as
the
eye
guides
the
fingers
when
we
read
music
so
must
the
ear
be
the
guide
and
the
sole
guide
of
the
foot
upon
the
pedal
the
foot
is
merely
the
servant
the
executive
agent
while
the
ear
is
the
guide
the
judge
and
the
final
criterion
if
there
is
any
phase
in
where
we
should
remember
particularly
that
music
is
for
the
ear
it
is
in
the
treatment
of
the
pedal
hence
whatever
is
said
here
in
the
following
lines
with
regard
to
the
pedal
must
be
understood
as
resting
upon
the
basis
of
this
principle
as
a
general
rule
i
recommend
pressing
the
lever
or
treadle
down
with
a
quick
definite
full
motion
and
always
immediately
after
mark
me
after
the
striking
of
the
keys
never
simultaneously
with
the
stroke
of
the
fingers
as
so
many
erroneously
assume
and
do
to
prevent
a
cacophonous
mixture
of
tones
we
should
consider
that
we
must
stop
the
old
tone
before
we
can
give
pedal
to
the
new
one
and
that
in
order
to
make
the
stopping
of
the
past
tone
perfect
we
must
allow
the
damper
to
press
upon
the
vibrating
strings
long
enough
to
do
its
work
if
however
we
tread
down
exactly
with
the
we
simply
inhibit
this
stopping
because
the
damper
in
question
is
lifted
again
before
it
has
had
time
to
fall
down
in
speaking
of
the
dampers
as
moving
up
and
down
i
have
in
mind
the
action
of
the
grand
piano
in
the
upright
piano
the
word
off
must
be
substituted
for
up
and
on
for
down
this
rule
will
work
in
a
vast
majority
of
cases
but
like
every
rule
especially
in
art
it
will
be
found
to
admit
of
many
exceptions
illustration
by
position
of
the
illustration
by
position
of
the
feet
on
the
clarity
in
pedalling
is
the
but
it
is
only
the
basis
it
is
not
all
that
constitutes
an
artistic
treatment
of
the
pedal
in
spite
of
what
i
have
just
said
above
there
are
in
many
pieces
moments
where
a
blending
of
tones
seemingly
foreign
to
one
another
is
a
means
of
characterisation
this
blending
is
especially
permissible
when
the
passing
foreign
tones
are
more
than
one
octave
removed
from
the
lowest
tone
and
from
the
harmony
built
upon
it
in
this
connection
it
should
be
remembered
that
the
pedal
is
not
merely
a
means
of
tone
prolongation
but
also
a
means
of
colouring
and
that
what
is
generally
understood
by
the
term
is
to
the
greatest
extent
produced
by
an
artistic
use
of
the
pedal
for
instance
great
accent
effects
can
be
produced
by
the
gradual
accumulating
of
through
the
pedal
and
its
sudden
release
on
the
accented
point
the
effect
is
somewhat
like
that
which
we
hear
in
the
orchestra
when
a
crescendo
is
supported
by
a
roll
of
the
drum
or
tympani
making
the
last
tap
on
the
accented
point
and
as
i
am
mentioning
the
orchestra
i
may
illustrate
by
the
french
horns
another
use
of
the
pedal
where
the
horns
do
not
carry
the
melody
which
they
do
relatively
seldom
they
are
employed
to
support
sustained
harmonies
and
their
effect
is
like
a
glazing
a
binding
a
unifying
of
the
various
of
the
other
instruments
just
such
a
glazing
is
produced
by
the
judicious
use
of
the
pedal
and
when
in
the
orchestra
the
horns
cease
and
the
strings
proceed
alone
there
ensues
a
certain
soberness
of
tone
which
we
produce
in
the
piano
by
the
release
and
of
the
pedal
in
the
former
instance
while
the
horns
were
active
they
furnished
the
harmonic
background
upon
which
the
thematic
development
of
the
musical
picture
proceeded
in
the
latter
case
when
the
horns
cease
the
background
is
taken
away
and
the
thematic
configurations
stand
out
so
to
speak
against
the
sky
hence
the
pedal
gives
to
the
piano
tone
that
unifying
glazing
that
finish
though
this
is
not
exactly
the
word
here
which
the
horns
or
softly
played
trombones
give
to
the
orchestra
the
pedal
can
do
more
than
at
times
we
can
produce
strange
glasslike
effects
by
purposely
mixing
tones
i
only
need
to
hint
at
some
of
the
fine
cadenzas
in
chopin
works
like
the
one
in
his
concerto
andante
measures
and
such
blendings
are
productive
of
a
multitude
of
effects
especially
when
we
add
the
agency
of
dynamic
gradation
effects
suggestive
of
winds
from
zephyr
to
boreas
of
the
splash
and
roar
of
waves
of
of
rustling
leaves
etc
this
mode
of
blending
can
be
extended
also
to
entire
harmonies
in
many
cases
where
one
fundamental
chord
is
to
predominate
for
some
time
while
other
chords
may
pass
in
quicker
succession
while
it
lasts
in
such
cases
it
is
by
no
means
imperative
to
abandon
the
pedal
we
need
only
to
establish
various
dynamic
levels
and
place
the
ruling
harmony
on
a
higher
level
than
the
passing
ones
in
other
words
the
predominating
chord
must
receive
so
much
force
that
it
can
outlast
all
those
briefer
ones
which
though
audible
must
die
of
their
own
weakness
and
while
the
strong
ruling
chord
was
constantly
disturbed
by
the
weaker
ones
it
also
its
supremacy
with
the
death
of
every
weaker
one
which
it
outlasted
this
use
of
the
pedal
has
its
limitations
in
the
evanescent
nature
of
the
tone
of
the
piano
that
moment
when
the
blending
of
tones
imperils
the
tonal
beauty
of
the
piece
in
hand
can
be
determined
solely
and
exclusively
by
the
player
own
ear
and
here
we
are
once
more
at
the
point
from
which
this
article
started
namely
that
the
ear
is
governor
and
that
it
alone
can
decide
whether
or
not
there
is
to
be
any
pedal
it
were
absurd
to
assume
that
we
can
greatly
please
the
ear
of
others
by
our
playing
so
long
as
our
own
ear
is
not
completely
satisfied
we
should
therefore
endeavour
to
train
the
susceptibility
of
our
ear
and
we
should
ever
make
it
more
difficult
to
gain
the
assent
of
our
own
ear
than
to
gain
that
of
our
auditors
they
may
apparently
not
notice
defects
in
your
playing
but
at
this
juncture
i
wish
to
say
a
word
of
serious
warning
do
not
confound
unmindfulness
with
consent
to
hear
ourselves
play
that
is
to
listen
to
our
own
playing
is
the
basis
of
all
and
also
of
course
of
the
technic
of
the
pedal
therefore
listen
carefully
attentively
to
the
tones
you
produce
when
you
employ
the
pedal
as
a
prolongation
of
the
fingers
to
sustain
tones
beyond
the
reach
of
the
fingers
see
to
it
that
you
catch
and
hold
the
fundamental
tone
of
your
chord
for
this
tone
must
be
always
your
chief
consideration
you
use
the
pedal
as
a
means
of
mere
or
as
a
medium
of
colouring
under
no
circumstances
use
it
as
a
cloak
for
imperfection
of
execution
for
like
charity
it
is
apt
to
be
made
to
cover
a
multitude
of
sins
but
again
like
charity
who
wants
to
make
himself
dependent
upon
it
when
honest
work
can
prevent
it
nor
should
the
pedal
be
used
to
make
up
for
a
deficiency
of
force
to
produce
a
forte
is
the
business
of
the
fingers
with
or
without
the
aid
of
the
arm
but
not
of
the
pedal
and
this
holds
true
also
of
the
left
pedal
for
which
the
germans
use
a
word
denoting
something
like
shifting
in
a
grand
piano
the
treading
of
the
left
pedal
shifts
the
hammers
so
far
to
one
side
that
instead
of
striking
three
strings
they
will
strike
only
two
in
the
pianos
of
fifty
and
more
years
ago
there
were
only
two
strings
to
each
tone
and
when
the
hammers
were
shifted
by
the
treading
of
the
left
pedal
they
struck
only
one
string
from
those
days
we
have
retained
the
term
one
string
in
an
upright
piano
the
lessening
of
is
produced
by
a
lessening
of
the
momentum
of
the
hammer
stroke
now
as
the
right
pedal
should
not
be
used
to
cover
a
lack
of
force
so
should
the
left
pedal
not
be
regarded
as
a
licence
to
neglect
the
formation
of
a
fine
touch
it
should
not
cloak
or
screen
a
defective
but
should
serve
exclusively
as
a
means
of
colouring
where
the
softness
of
tone
is
coupled
with
what
the
jewellers
call
dull
finish
for
the
left
pedal
does
not
soften
the
tone
without
changing
its
character
it
lessens
the
quantity
of
tone
but
at
the
same
time
it
also
markedly
affects
the
quality
to
train
your
ear
and
then
use
both
pedals
honestly
use
them
for
what
they
were
made
remember
that
even
screens
are
not
used
for
hiding
things
behind
them
but
for
decorative
purposes
or
for
protection
those
who
do
use
them
for
hiding
something
must
have
something
which
they
prefer
to
hide
playing
in
style
by
playing
a
piece
of
music
in
style
is
understood
a
rendition
which
does
absolute
justice
to
its
contents
in
regard
to
the
manner
of
expression
now
the
true
manner
of
expression
must
be
sought
and
found
for
each
piece
individually
even
though
a
number
of
different
pieces
may
be
written
by
one
and
the
same
composer
our
first
endeavour
should
be
to
search
out
the
peculiarity
of
the
piece
in
hand
rather
than
that
of
the
composer
in
general
if
you
have
succeeded
in
playing
one
work
by
chopin
in
style
it
does
not
follow
by
any
means
that
you
can
play
equally
well
any
other
work
from
his
pen
though
on
general
lines
his
manner
of
writing
may
be
the
same
in
all
his
works
there
will
nevertheless
be
marked
differences
between
the
various
pieces
only
by
careful
study
of
each
work
by
itself
can
we
find
the
key
to
its
correct
conception
and
rendition
we
will
never
find
it
in
books
about
the
composer
nor
in
such
as
treat
of
his
works
but
only
in
the
works
themselves
and
in
each
one
people
who
study
a
lot
of
things
about
a
work
of
art
may
possibly
enrich
their
general
knowledge
but
they
never
can
get
that
specific
knowledge
needful
for
the
interpretation
of
the
particular
work
in
hand
its
own
contents
alone
can
furnish
that
knowledge
we
know
from
frequent
experience
that
musicians
or
as
they
are
now
called
musicologists
usually
read
everything
in
sight
and
yet
their
playing
rises
hardly
ever
above
mediocre
dilettanteism
why
should
we
look
for
a
correct
conception
of
a
piece
anywhere
but
in
the
piece
itself
surely
the
composer
has
embodied
in
the
piece
all
he
knew
and
felt
when
he
wrote
it
why
then
not
listen
to
his
specific
language
instead
of
losing
our
way
in
the
terms
of
another
art
literature
is
literature
and
music
is
music
they
may
combine
as
in
song
but
one
can
never
be
substituted
for
the
other
students
never
to
understand
a
composer
specific
language
because
their
sole
concern
is
to
make
the
piece
effective
in
the
sense
of
a
clever
stunt
this
tendency
is
most
deplorable
for
there
really
does
exist
a
specifically
musical
language
by
purely
material
means
through
notes
pauses
dynamic
and
other
signs
through
special
annotations
the
composer
encloses
in
his
work
the
whole
world
of
his
imagination
the
duty
of
the
interpretative
artist
is
to
extract
from
these
material
things
the
spiritual
essence
and
to
transmit
it
to
his
hearers
to
achieve
this
he
must
understand
this
musical
language
in
general
and
of
each
composition
in
particular
but
how
is
this
language
to
be
learned
by
conning
with
careful
attentiveness
and
of
course
absorbing
the
purely
material
matter
of
a
piece
the
notes
pauses
time
values
dynamic
indications
etc
if
a
player
be
scrupulously
exact
in
his
mere
reading
of
a
piece
it
will
of
itself
lead
him
to
understand
a
goodly
portion
of
the
specific
language
nay
more
through
a
really
correct
conning
the
player
is
enabled
to
determine
upon
the
points
of
repose
as
well
as
upon
the
matter
of
climax
and
thus
to
create
a
basis
for
the
operations
of
his
own
imagination
after
that
nothing
remains
but
to
call
forth
into
tonal
life
through
the
fingers
what
his
musical
intelligence
has
grasped
which
is
a
purely
technical
task
to
transform
the
purely
technical
and
material
processes
into
a
thing
that
lives
of
course
rests
with
the
natural
emotional
temperamental
endowments
of
the
individual
it
rests
with
those
many
and
complex
qualities
which
are
usually
summarised
by
the
term
talent
but
this
must
be
presupposed
with
a
player
who
aspires
to
artistic
work
on
the
other
hand
talent
alone
can
not
lift
the
veil
that
hides
the
spiritual
content
of
a
composition
if
its
possessor
neglects
to
examine
the
latter
carefully
as
to
its
purely
material
ingredients
he
may
flatter
the
ear
sensuously
speaking
but
he
can
never
play
the
piece
in
style
how
can
we
whether
we
are
or
are
not
approaching
the
spiritual
phase
of
a
piece
by
repetition
under
unremitting
attention
to
the
written
values
if
then
you
should
find
how
much
there
is
still
left
for
you
to
do
you
have
proved
to
yourself
that
you
have
understood
the
piece
spiritually
and
are
on
the
right
track
to
master
it
with
every
repetition
you
will
discover
some
hitherto
unnoticed
defect
in
your
interpretation
obviate
these
defects
one
by
one
and
in
so
doing
you
will
come
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
spiritual
essence
of
the
work
in
hand
as
to
the
remaining
purely
technical
task
as
i
said
before
it
must
not
be
underestimated
to
transmit
one
matured
conception
to
auditors
requires
a
considerable
degree
of
mechanical
skill
and
this
skill
in
its
turn
must
be
under
absolute
control
of
the
will
of
course
after
the
foregoing
this
does
not
mean
that
everybody
who
has
a
good
and
technic
can
interpret
a
piece
in
style
remember
that
to
possess
wealth
is
one
thing
to
put
it
to
good
use
is
quite
another
it
is
sometimes
said
that
the
too
objective
study
of
a
piece
may
impair
the
individuality
of
its
rendition
have
no
fear
of
that
if
ten
players
study
the
same
piece
with
the
same
high
degree
of
exactness
and
objectivity
depend
upon
it
each
one
will
still
play
it
quite
differently
from
the
nine
others
though
each
one
may
think
his
rendition
the
only
correct
one
for
each
one
will
express
what
according
to
his
lights
he
has
mentally
and
temperamentally
absorbed
of
the
distinctive
feature
which
constitutes
the
difference
in
the
ten
conceptions
each
one
will
have
been
unconscious
while
it
formed
itself
and
perhaps
also
afterward
but
it
is
just
this
unconsciously
formed
feature
which
constitutes
legitimate
individuality
and
which
alone
will
admit
of
a
real
fusion
of
the
composer
and
the
interpreter
thought
a
purposed
blatant
parading
of
the
player
dear
self
through
wilful
additions
of
nuances
shadings
effects
and
what
not
is
tantamount
to
a
falsification
at
best
it
is
playing
to
the
galleries
charlatanism
the
player
should
always
feel
convinced
that
he
plays
only
what
is
written
to
the
auditor
who
with
his
own
and
different
intelligence
follows
the
player
performance
the
piece
will
appear
in
the
light
of
the
player
individuality
the
stronger
this
is
the
more
it
will
colour
the
performance
when
unconsciously
admixed
often
said
to
just
play
first
exactly
what
is
written
if
you
have
done
full
justice
to
it
and
then
still
feel
like
adding
or
changing
anything
why
do
so
mind
well
after
you
have
done
full
justice
to
what
is
written
how
few
are
those
who
fulfil
this
duty
i
venture
to
prove
to
any
one
who
will
play
for
me
if
he
be
at
all
worth
listening
to
that
he
does
not
play
more
than
is
written
as
he
may
think
but
in
fact
a
good
deal
less
than
the
printed
page
reveals
and
this
is
one
of
the
principal
causes
of
misunderstanding
the
esoteric
portion
the
inherent
style
of
a
piece
a
misunderstanding
which
is
not
always
confined
to
amateurs
inexact
reading
the
true
interpretation
of
a
piece
of
music
results
from
a
correct
understanding
of
it
and
this
in
turn
depends
solely
upon
scrupulously
exact
reading
the
language
of
then
i
repeat
through
exact
reading
you
will
then
soon
fathom
the
musical
meaning
of
a
composition
and
transmit
it
intelligibly
to
your
listeners
would
you
satisfy
your
curiosity
as
to
what
manner
of
person
the
author
is
or
was
at
the
time
of
writing
you
may
do
so
but
as
i
said
in
the
foreword
your
chief
interest
should
centre
in
the
composition
not
in
the
composer
for
only
by
studying
his
work
will
you
be
enabled
to
play
it
in
style
how
rubinstein
taught
me
to
play
outside
of
the
regular
students
of
the
imperial
conservatory
of
music
at
petersburg
rubinstein
accepted
but
one
pupil
the
advantage
and
privilege
to
be
that
one
pupil
was
mine
i
came
to
rubinstein
when
i
was
sixteen
years
old
and
left
him
at
eighteen
since
that
time
i
have
studied
only
by
myself
for
to
whom
could
i
have
gone
after
rubinstein
his
very
manner
of
teaching
was
such
that
it
would
have
made
any
other
teacher
appear
to
me
like
a
schoolmaster
he
chose
the
method
of
indirect
instruction
through
suggestive
comparisons
he
touched
upon
the
strictly
musical
only
upon
rare
occasions
in
this
way
he
wished
to
awaken
within
me
the
concretely
musical
as
a
parallel
of
his
generalisations
and
thereby
preserve
my
musical
individuality
he
never
played
for
me
he
only
talked
and
i
understanding
him
translated
his
meaning
into
music
and
musical
utterances
sometimes
for
instance
when
i
played
the
same
phrase
twice
in
succession
and
played
it
both
times
alike
say
in
a
sequence
he
would
say
in
fine
weather
you
may
play
it
as
you
did
but
when
it
rains
play
it
differently
rubinstein
was
much
given
to
whims
and
moods
and
he
often
grew
enthusiastic
about
a
certain
conception
only
to
prefer
a
different
one
the
next
day
yet
he
was
always
logical
in
his
art
and
though
he
aimed
at
hitting
the
nail
from
various
points
of
view
he
always
hit
it
on
the
head
thus
he
never
permitted
me
to
bring
to
him
as
a
lesson
any
composition
more
than
once
he
explained
this
to
me
once
by
saying
that
he
might
forget
in
the
next
lesson
what
he
told
me
in
the
previous
one
and
by
drawing
an
entirely
new
picture
only
confuse
my
mind
nor
did
he
ever
permit
me
to
bring
one
of
his
own
works
though
he
never
explained
to
me
his
reason
for
this
singular
attitude
illustration
illustration
rubinstein
taught
me
to
usually
when
i
came
to
him
arriving
from
berlin
where
i
lived
i
found
him
seated
at
his
smoking
russian
cigarettes
he
lived
at
the
hôtel
de
after
a
kindly
salute
he
would
always
ask
me
the
same
question
well
what
is
new
in
the
world
i
remember
replying
to
him
i
know
nothing
new
that
why
i
came
to
learn
something
new
from
you
rubinstein
understanding
at
once
the
musical
meaning
of
my
words
smiled
and
the
lesson
thus
promised
to
be
a
fine
one
i
noticed
he
was
usually
not
alone
when
i
came
but
had
as
visitors
several
elderly
ladies
sometimes
very
old
ladies
mostly
russians
and
some
young
girls
seldom
any
men
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
he
directed
me
to
the
piano
in
the
corner
a
bechstein
which
was
most
of
the
time
shockingly
out
of
tune
but
to
this
condition
of
his
piano
he
was
always
serenely
indifferent
he
would
remain
at
his
desk
studying
the
notes
of
the
work
while
i
played
he
always
compelled
me
to
bring
the
pieces
along
insisting
that
i
should
play
everything
just
as
it
was
written
he
would
follow
every
note
of
my
playing
with
his
eyes
riveted
on
the
printed
pages
a
pedant
he
certainly
was
a
stickler
for
the
letter
incredibly
so
especially
when
one
considered
the
liberties
he
took
when
he
played
the
same
works
once
i
called
his
attention
modestly
to
this
seeming
paradox
and
he
answered
when
you
are
as
old
as
i
am
now
you
may
do
as
i
do
if
you
can
once
i
played
a
liszt
rhapsody
pretty
badly
after
a
few
moments
he
said
the
way
you
played
this
piece
would
be
all
right
for
auntie
or
mamma
then
rising
and
coming
toward
me
he
would
say
now
let
us
see
how
we
play
such
things
then
i
would
begin
all
over
again
but
hardly
had
i
played
a
few
measures
when
he
would
interrupt
and
say
did
you
start
i
thought
i
had
heard
right
yes
master
i
certainly
did
i
would
reply
oh
he
would
say
vaguely
i
did
notice
how
do
you
mean
i
would
ask
i
mean
this
he
would
answer
before
your
fingers
touch
the
keys
you
must
begin
the
piece
mentally
that
is
you
must
have
settled
in
your
mind
the
the
manner
of
touch
and
above
all
the
attack
of
the
first
notes
before
your
actual
playing
begins
and
what
is
the
character
of
this
piece
is
it
dramatic
tragic
lyric
romantic
humourous
heroic
sublime
mystic
what
well
why
do
you
speak
generally
i
would
mutter
something
after
such
a
tirade
but
usually
i
said
something
stupid
because
of
the
awe
with
which
he
inspired
me
finally
after
trying
several
of
his
suggested
designations
i
would
hit
it
right
then
he
would
say
well
there
we
are
at
last
humourous
is
it
very
well
and
rhapsodical
irregular
hey
you
understand
the
meaning
i
would
answer
yes
very
well
then
he
would
reply
now
prove
it
and
then
i
would
begin
all
over
again
he
would
stand
at
my
side
and
whenever
he
wanted
a
special
stress
laid
upon
a
certain
note
his
powerful
fingers
would
press
upon
my
left
shoulder
with
such
force
that
i
would
stab
the
keys
till
the
piano
fairly
screamed
for
me
when
this
did
not
have
the
effect
he
was
after
he
would
simply
press
his
whole
hand
upon
mine
flattening
it
out
and
spreading
it
like
butter
all
over
the
keys
black
and
white
ones
creating
a
frightful
cacophony
then
he
would
say
almost
with
anger
but
cleaner
cleaner
cleaner
as
if
the
discord
had
been
of
my
doing
such
occurrences
did
not
lack
a
humourous
side
but
their
turn
into
the
tragical
always
hung
by
a
hair
especially
if
i
had
tried
to
explain
or
to
make
excuses
so
i
generally
kept
silent
and
i
found
after
some
experience
that
was
the
only
proper
thing
for
me
to
do
for
just
as
quickly
as
he
would
flare
up
he
would
also
calm
down
again
and
when
the
piece
was
ended
i
would
hear
his
usual
comment
you
are
an
excellent
young
man
and
how
quickly
was
all
pain
then
forgotten
i
remember
on
one
occasion
that
i
played
when
i
came
to
the
place
in
the
composition
where
the
says
to
the
child
thou
dear
sweet
child
oh
come
with
me
and
i
had
played
several
false
notes
besides
very
poor
arpeggios
rubinstein
asked
me
do
you
know
the
text
at
this
place
as
a
reply
i
quoted
the
words
very
well
then
he
said
the
addresses
the
child
is
a
spirit
a
ghost
so
play
this
place
in
a
spiritlike
way
ghostly
if
you
will
but
not
ghastly
with
false
notes
i
had
to
laugh
at
his
and
rubinstein
himself
chimed
in
and
the
piece
was
saved
or
rather
the
player
for
when
i
repeated
that
particular
part
it
went
very
well
and
he
allowed
me
to
continue
without
further
interruption
once
i
asked
him
for
the
fingering
of
a
rather
complex
passage
play
it
with
your
nose
he
replied
but
make
it
sound
well
this
remark
puzzled
me
and
there
i
sat
and
wondered
what
he
meant
as
i
understand
it
now
he
meant
help
yourself
the
lord
helps
those
who
help
themselves
as
i
said
before
rubinstein
never
played
for
me
the
works
i
had
to
study
he
explained
analysed
elucidated
everything
that
he
wanted
me
to
know
but
this
done
he
left
me
to
my
own
judgment
for
only
then
he
would
explain
would
my
achievement
be
my
own
and
incontestable
property
i
learned
from
rubinstein
in
this
way
the
valuable
truth
that
the
conception
of
obtained
through
the
playing
of
another
gives
us
only
transient
impressions
they
come
and
go
while
the
conception
will
last
and
remain
our
own
now
when
i
look
back
upon
my
with
rubinstein
i
can
see
that
he
did
not
so
much
instruct
me
as
that
i
learned
from
him
he
was
not
a
pedagogue
in
the
usual
meaning
of
that
word
he
indicated
to
me
an
altitude
offering
a
fine
view
but
how
i
was
to
get
up
there
was
my
affair
he
did
not
bother
about
it
play
with
your
nose
yes
but
when
i
bumped
it
till
it
fairly
bled
where
would
i
get
the
metaphorical
handkerchief
in
my
imagination
and
he
was
right
to
be
sure
this
method
would
not
work
with
all
pupils
but
it
is
nevertheless
well
calculated
to
develop
a
student
original
thought
and
bring
out
whatever
acumen
he
may
possess
if
such
a
one
succeeded
by
his
own
study
and
mental
force
to
reach
the
desired
point
which
the
great
magician
wizardry
had
made
him
see
he
had
gained
the
reliance
in
his
own
strength
he
felt
sure
that
he
would
always
find
that
point
again
even
though
he
should
lose
his
way
once
or
twice
as
every
one
with
an
honest
aspiration
is
liable
to
do
i
recall
that
rubinstein
once
said
to
me
do
you
know
why
is
so
difficult
because
it
is
prone
to
be
either
affected
or
else
afflicted
with
mannerisms
and
when
these
two
pitfalls
are
luckily
avoided
then
it
is
liable
to
be
dry
the
truth
lies
between
those
three
mischiefs
when
it
was
settled
that
i
should
make
my
hamburg
début
under
his
baton
with
his
own
concerto
i
thought
the
time
had
come
at
last
to
study
with
him
one
of
his
own
works
so
i
proposed
it
but
rubinstein
disposed
of
it
i
still
see
him
as
if
it
were
but
yesterday
seated
in
the
greenroom
of
the
berlin
philharmonic
during
an
intermission
in
his
concert
it
was
on
a
saturday
and
telling
me
we
shall
appear
together
in
hamburg
on
monday
the
time
was
short
but
i
knew
the
concerto
and
hoped
to
go
through
it
with
him
some
time
in
the
remaining
two
days
i
asked
his
permission
to
play
the
concerto
for
him
but
he
declined
my
urgent
request
saying
it
is
not
necessary
we
understand
each
other
and
even
in
this
critical
moment
he
left
me
to
my
own
resources
after
the
last
and
only
rehearsal
the
great
master
embraced
me
before
the
whole
orchestra
and
i
well
i
was
not
in
the
seventh
but
in
the
eighth
heaven
everything
was
all
right
i
said
to
myself
for
rubinstein
rubinstein
was
satisfied
the
public
simply
had
to
be
the
concert
went
off
splendidly
after
that
memorable
début
in
hamburg
which
was
on
march
i
went
directly
to
see
rubinstein
little
dreaming
that
my
eyes
would
then
see
him
for
the
last
time
i
brought
with
me
a
large
photograph
of
himself
and
though
fully
aware
of
his
unconquerable
aversion
to
autographing
my
desire
for
the
possession
of
his
signature
overruled
my
reluctance
and
i
made
my
request
he
raised
both
fists
and
thundered
and
tu
brute
but
my
wish
was
granted
and
i
reproduce
the
portrait
in
this
article
then
i
asked
him
when
i
should
play
for
him
again
and
to
my
consternation
he
answered
never
in
my
despair
i
asked
him
why
not
he
generous
soul
that
he
was
then
said
to
me
my
dear
boy
i
have
told
you
all
i
know
about
legitimate
and
and
then
changing
his
tone
somewhat
he
added
and
if
you
do
know
it
why
go
to
the
devil
i
saw
only
too
well
that
while
he
smiled
as
he
said
it
he
meant
it
seriously
and
i
left
him
i
never
saw
rubinstein
again
soon
after
that
he
returned
to
his
villa
in
peterhof
near
petersburg
and
there
he
died
on
november
the
effect
that
his
death
had
upon
me
i
shall
never
forget
the
world
appeared
suddenly
entirely
empty
to
me
devoid
of
any
interest
my
grief
made
me
realise
how
my
heart
had
worshipped
not
only
the
artist
in
him
but
also
the
man
how
i
loved
him
as
if
he
were
my
father
i
learned
of
his
death
through
the
english
papers
while
i
was
from
london
to
cheltenham
where
i
was
booked
for
a
recital
on
the
twentieth
the
minor
sonata
by
chopin
happened
to
be
on
the
programme
and
as
i
struck
the
first
notes
of
the
funeral
march
the
whole
audience
rose
from
their
seats
as
if
by
command
and
remained
standing
with
bowed
heads
during
the
whole
piece
in
honour
of
the
great
departed
a
singular
coincidence
occurred
at
my
concert
on
the
preceding
day
the
day
of
rubinstein
death
on
this
day
i
played
for
the
first
time
in
public
after
my
seven
retirement
excepting
my
hamburg
début
it
was
in
london
in
this
concert
i
played
as
a
novelty
a
polonaise
in
minor
which
rubinstein
had
but
recently
written
in
dresden
and
dedicated
to
me
he
had
included
it
in
the
set
called
souvenirs
de
dresde
this
piece
has
throughout
the
character
of
a
funeral
march
in
all
but
the
little
did
i
dream
while
i
was
playing
it
that
day
that
i
was
singing
him
into
his
eternal
rest
for
it
was
but
a
few
hours
later
that
in
the
far
east
of
europe
my
great
master
passed
away
suddenly
of
heart
failure
two
years
later
i
played
this
same
polonaise
for
the
second
and
last
time
it
was
on
the
anniversary
of
his
death
in
petersburg
where
in
honour
of
his
memory
i
gave
a
recital
the
proceeds
of
which
i
devoted
to
the
rubinstein
fund
since
then
i
have
played
this
piece
only
once
at
home
and
to
myself
excluding
it
entirely
from
my
public
répertoire
for
though
it
was
dedicated
to
me
the
time
and
circumstances
of
its
initial
performance
always
made
me
feel
as
if
it
still
belonged
to
my
master
or
at
best
as
if
it
were
something
personal
and
private
between
us
two
indispensables
in
pianistic
success
i
the
indispensables
in
pianistic
success
are
not
the
indispensables
in
all
success
very
much
the
same
nothing
can
take
the
place
of
real
worth
this
is
especially
true
of
america
in
which
country
i
have
lived
longer
than
in
any
other
and
which
i
am
glad
to
call
my
home
americans
are
probably
the
most
traveled
people
of
the
world
and
it
is
futile
to
offer
them
anything
but
the
best
some
years
ago
a
conductor
brought
to
this
country
an
orchestra
of
character
with
the
idea
that
the
people
would
accept
it
just
because
it
bore
the
name
of
a
famous
european
city
which
possessed
one
of
the
great
orchestras
of
the
world
it
was
a
good
orchestra
but
there
were
better
orchestras
in
american
cities
and
it
took
american
audiences
just
two
concerts
to
find
this
out
resulting
in
a
disastrous
failure
which
the
conductor
was
man
enough
to
face
and
personally
defray
the
american
people
know
the
best
and
will
have
nothing
but
the
best
therefore
if
you
would
make
a
list
of
the
indispensables
of
pianistic
success
in
this
country
at
this
time
you
must
put
at
the
head
of
your
list
real
worth
naturally
one
of
the
first
indispensables
would
include
what
many
term
musical
gift
however
this
is
often
greatly
misunderstood
we
are
happily
past
the
time
when
music
was
regarded
as
a
special
kind
of
divine
dispensation
which
by
its
very
possession
robbed
the
musician
of
any
claim
to
possible
excellence
in
other
lines
in
other
words
music
was
so
special
a
gift
that
it
was
even
thought
by
some
misguided
people
to
isolate
the
musician
from
the
world
to
make
him
a
thing
apart
and
different
from
other
men
and
women
of
high
aspirations
and
attainments
it
is
true
that
there
have
been
famous
prodigies
in
mathematics
and
in
games
such
as
chess
who
have
given
evidence
of
astonishing
prowess
in
their
chosen
work
but
who
at
the
same
time
seem
to
have
been
lamentably
in
many
other
ways
this
is
not
the
case
in
music
at
this
day
at
least
for
although
a
special
love
for
music
and
a
special
quickness
in
mastering
musical
problems
are
indispensable
yet
the
musicians
are
usually
men
and
women
of
broad
cultural
development
if
they
desire
it
and
are
willing
to
work
for
it
nor
can
i
concede
that
a
very
finely
developed
sense
of
hearing
is
in
all
cases
essential
the
possession
of
what
is
known
as
absolute
pitch
which
so
many
seem
to
think
is
a
sure
indication
of
musical
genius
is
often
a
nuisance
schumann
did
not
possess
it
and
unless
i
am
incorrectly
informed
wagner
did
not
have
absolute
pitch
i
have
it
and
can
i
believe
distinguish
differences
of
an
eighth
of
a
tone
i
find
it
more
disturbing
than
beneficial
my
father
had
absolute
pitch
in
remarkable
fashion
he
seemed
to
have
extremely
acute
ears
indeed
it
was
often
impossible
for
him
to
identify
a
composition
if
he
heard
it
played
in
a
different
key
it
sounded
so
different
to
him
mozart
had
absolute
pitch
but
music
in
his
day
was
far
less
complicated
we
now
live
in
an
age
of
melodic
and
contrapuntal
intricacy
and
i
do
not
believe
that
the
acute
sense
of
hearing
or
highly
developed
sense
of
absolute
pitch
has
very
much
to
do
with
one
real
musical
ability
the
physical
hearing
is
nothing
the
spiritual
hearing
if
one
may
say
so
is
what
really
counts
if
in
transposing
for
instance
one
has
associated
the
contents
of
a
piece
so
closely
with
its
corresponding
tonality
that
it
is
hard
to
play
in
any
other
tonality
this
constitutes
a
difficulty
not
an
advantage
ii
too
much
can
not
be
said
about
the
advantage
of
an
early
drill
the
impressions
made
during
youth
seem
to
be
the
most
lasting
i
am
certain
that
the
pieces
that
i
learned
before
i
was
ten
years
of
age
remain
more
persistently
in
my
memory
than
the
compositions
i
studied
after
i
was
thirty
the
child
who
is
destined
for
a
musical
career
should
receive
as
much
musical
instruction
in
early
life
as
is
compatible
with
the
health
and
receptivity
to
postpone
the
work
too
long
is
just
as
dangerous
to
the
child
career
as
it
is
dangerous
to
overload
the
pupil
with
more
work
than
his
mind
and
body
can
absorb
children
learn
far
more
rapidly
than
adults
not
merely
because
of
the
fact
that
the
work
becomes
more
and
more
complicated
as
the
student
advances
but
also
because
the
child
mind
is
so
vastly
more
receptive
the
child
power
of
absorption
in
music
study
between
the
ages
of
eight
and
twelve
is
simply
enormous
it
is
less
between
twelve
and
twenty
still
less
between
twenty
and
thirty
and
often
lamentably
small
between
thirty
and
forty
it
might
be
represented
by
some
such
diagram
as
to
years
of
age
limited
receptivity
limited
results
to
still
less
accomplishment
years
of
age
to
less
accomplishment
years
of
age
to
years
greatest
receptivity
of
greatest
accomplishment
age
of
course
these
lines
are
only
comparative
and
there
are
exceptional
cases
of
astonishing
development
late
in
life
due
to
enormous
ambition
and
industry
yet
the
period
of
highest
achievement
is
usually
early
in
life
this
is
especially
true
in
the
arts
where
digital
skill
is
concerned
all
teachers
are
aware
of
the
need
for
the
best
possible
drill
early
in
life
the
idea
one
so
often
hears
expressed
in
america
my
daughter
is
only
beginning
her
studies
any
teacher
will
do
has
been
the
source
of
great
laxity
in
american
musical
education
if
the
father
who
has
such
an
idea
would
only
transpose
the
same
thought
to
the
building
of
a
house
he
would
be
surprised
to
find
himself
saying
i
am
only
laying
a
foundation
any
kind
of
trashy
material
will
do
i
will
use
inferior
cement
plaster
stone
bricks
decayed
wood
and
cheap
hardware
and
employ
the
cheapest
labor
i
can
procure
but
when
i
get
to
the
roof
i
shall
engage
the
finest
roofmakers
in
the
world
the
beginning
is
of
such
tremendous
importance
that
only
the
best
is
good
enough
by
this
i
do
not
mean
the
most
expensive
teacher
obtainable
but
someone
who
is
thorough
painstaking
conscientious
alert
and
experienced
the
foundation
is
the
part
of
the
house
in
which
the
greatest
strength
and
thoroughness
is
required
everything
must
be
solid
substantial
firm
and
secure
to
stand
the
stress
of
use
and
the
test
of
time
of
course
there
is
such
a
thing
as
employing
a
teacher
with
a
big
reputation
and
exceptional
skill
who
would
make
an
excellent
teacher
for
an
advanced
student
but
who
might
be
incapable
of
laying
a
good
foundation
for
the
beginner
one
wants
strength
at
the
foundation
not
gold
ornaments
and
marble
trimmings
and
beautiful
decorations
fretwork
carving
just
as
in
great
cities
one
finds
firms
which
make
a
specialty
of
laying
foundations
for
immense
buildings
so
it
is
often
wise
to
employ
a
teacher
who
specializes
in
instructing
beginners
in
european
music
schools
this
has
almost
always
been
the
case
it
is
not
virtuosity
that
is
needed
in
the
makeup
of
the
teacher
of
beginners
but
rather
sound
musicianship
as
well
as
the
comprehension
of
the
child
psychology
drill
drill
and
more
drill
is
the
secret
of
the
early
training
of
the
mind
and
hand
this
is
indicated
quite
as
much
in
games
such
as
tennis
billiards
and
golf
think
of
the
remarkable
records
of
some
very
young
players
in
these
games
and
you
will
see
what
may
be
accomplished
in
the
early
years
of
the
young
player
in
all
arts
and
sciences
as
one
advances
complications
and
obstacles
seem
to
multiply
in
complexity
until
the
point
of
mastery
is
reached
then
the
tendency
seems
to
reverse
itself
until
a
kind
of
circle
carries
one
round
again
to
the
point
of
simplicity
i
have
often
liked
to
picture
this
to
myself
in
this
way
illustration
it
is
encouraging
for
the
student
to
know
that
he
must
expect
to
be
confronted
with
difficulties
until
he
reaches
the
point
where
all
the
intense
and
intricate
problems
seem
to
solve
themselves
dissolving
gradually
into
the
light
of
a
clear
understanding
day
this
is
to
me
a
general
principle
underlying
almost
all
lines
of
human
achievement
and
it
appears
to
me
that
the
student
should
learn
its
application
not
only
to
his
own
but
to
other
occupations
and
attainments
this
universal
line
of
life
starting
with
birth
mounting
to
its
climax
in
middle
life
and
then
passing
on
to
greater
and
greater
simplicity
of
means
until
at
death
the
circle
is
almost
completed
is
a
kind
of
human
program
which
all
successful
men
would
appear
to
follow
perhaps
we
can
make
this
clearer
by
studying
the
evolution
of
the
steam
engine
the
steam
engine
started
with
the
most
primitive
kind
of
apparatus
at
the
very
first
it
was
of
the
turbine
type
hero
of
alexander
heron
in
greek
made
the
first
steam
engine
which
was
little
more
than
a
toy
according
to
some
historians
heron
lived
in
the
second
century
before
christ
and
according
to
others
his
work
was
done
in
the
latter
half
of
the
first
century
he
was
an
ingenious
mathematician
who
often
startled
the
people
of
this
time
with
his
mechanical
contrivances
it
is
difficult
to
show
the
principle
of
his
engine
in
an
exact
drawing
but
the
following
indicates
in
a
crude
way
the
application
of
steam
force
something
after
the
manner
in
which
heron
first
applied
it
illustration
a
is
a
retort
containing
water
which
is
heated
to
steam
which
issues
from
the
tube
at
b
and
is
caught
in
the
wheel
in
such
a
manner
that
the
wheel
revolves
the
principle
is
simplicity
itself
and
the
noteworthy
fact
is
that
primitive
as
it
is
it
has
the
characteristic
principle
involved
in
the
turbine
engine
of
after
heron
many
others
attempted
to
use
controlled
steam
to
produce
force
until
in
james
watt
made
discoveries
which
paved
the
way
for
the
modern
steam
engine
constituting
him
virtually
the
inventor
of
the
type
thereafter
the
machinery
became
more
and
more
complicated
and
enormous
in
size
double
triple
and
quadruple
expansion
types
were
introduced
until
at
the
centennial
exposition
at
philadelphia
in
a
giant
engine
was
exhibited
by
corliss
a
marvelous
engine
with
many
elaborate
details
then
having
reached
the
maximum
curve
of
complexity
engine
construction
became
more
and
more
simple
and
now
we
have
turbine
engines
such
as
the
parsons
engines
which
are
all
far
smaller
and
simpler
than
their
grandfathers
of
the
seventies
but
at
the
same
time
vastly
more
powerful
and
efficient
iii
in
the
art
of
piano
playing
we
have
much
the
same
line
of
curve
at
first
there
was
childlike
simplicity
then
with
the
further
development
of
the
art
we
find
the
tendency
toward
enormous
technical
accomplishment
and
very
great
complexity
fifty
years
ago
technic
was
everything
the
art
of
piano
playing
was
the
art
of
the
musical
speedometer
the
art
of
playing
the
greatest
number
of
notes
in
the
shortest
possible
time
of
course
there
were
a
few
outstanding
giants
rubinsteins
liszts
and
chopins
who
made
their
technic
subordinate
to
their
message
but
the
public
was
dazzled
with
technic
one
might
better
say
pyrotechnics
now
we
find
the
circle
drawing
toward
the
point
of
simplicity
again
great
beauty
combined
with
adequate
technic
is
demanded
rather
than
enormous
technic
divorced
from
beauty
technic
represents
the
material
side
of
art
as
money
represents
the
material
side
of
life
by
all
means
achieve
a
fine
technic
but
do
not
dream
that
you
will
be
artistically
happy
with
this
alone
thousands
millions
of
people
believe
that
money
is
the
basis
of
great
happiness
only
to
find
when
they
have
accumulated
vast
fortunes
that
money
is
only
one
of
the
extraneous
details
which
may
or
may
not
contribute
to
real
content
in
life
technic
is
a
chest
of
tools
from
which
the
skilled
artisan
draws
what
he
needs
at
the
right
time
for
the
right
purpose
the
mere
possession
of
the
tools
means
nothing
it
is
the
instinct
the
artistic
intuition
as
to
when
and
how
to
use
the
tools
that
counts
it
is
like
opening
the
drawer
and
finding
what
one
needs
at
the
moment
there
is
a
technic
which
liberates
and
a
technic
which
represses
the
artistic
self
all
technic
ought
to
be
a
means
of
expression
it
is
perfectly
possible
to
accumulate
a
technic
that
is
next
to
useless
i
recall
the
case
of
a
musician
in
paris
who
studied
counterpoint
harmony
and
fugue
for
eight
years
and
at
the
end
of
that
time
he
was
incapable
of
using
any
of
his
knowledge
in
practical
musical
composition
why
because
he
had
spent
all
of
his
time
on
the
mere
dry
technic
of
composition
and
none
in
actual
composition
he
told
me
that
he
had
been
years
trying
to
link
his
technic
to
the
artistic
side
of
things
to
write
compositions
that
embodied
real
music
and
not
merely
the
reflex
of
uninspired
technical
exercises
i
am
a
firm
believer
in
having
technic
go
hand
in
hand
with
veritable
musical
development
from
the
start
neither
can
be
studied
alone
one
must
balance
the
other
the
teacher
who
gives
a
pupil
a
long
course
in
strict
technic
unbroken
by
the
intelligent
study
of
real
music
is
producing
a
musical
mechanic
an
artisan
not
an
artist
please
do
not
quote
me
as
making
a
diatribe
against
technic
i
believe
in
technic
to
the
fullest
extent
in
its
proper
place
rosenthal
who
was
unquestionably
one
of
the
greatest
technicians
once
said
to
me
have
found
that
the
people
who
claim
that
technic
is
not
an
important
thing
in
piano
playing
simply
do
not
possess
it
for
instance
one
hears
now
and
then
that
scales
are
unnecessary
in
piano
practice
a
scale
is
a
truly
beautiful
thing
but
few
people
play
them
well
because
they
do
not
practice
them
enough
scales
are
among
the
most
difficult
things
in
piano
playing
and
how
the
student
who
aspires
to
rise
above
mediocrity
can
hope
to
succeed
without
a
thorough
and
drill
in
all
kinds
of
scales
i
do
not
know
i
do
know
however
that
i
was
drilled
unrelentingly
in
them
and
that
i
have
been
grateful
for
this
all
my
life
do
not
despise
scales
but
rather
seek
to
make
them
beautiful
the
clever
teacher
will
always
find
some
piece
that
will
illustrate
the
use
and
result
of
the
technical
means
employed
there
are
thousands
of
such
pieces
that
indicate
the
use
of
scales
chords
arpeggios
thirds
and
the
pupil
is
encouraged
to
find
that
what
he
has
been
working
so
hard
to
acquire
may
be
made
the
source
of
beautiful
expression
in
a
real
piece
of
music
this
to
my
mind
should
be
part
of
the
regular
program
of
the
student
from
the
very
start
and
it
is
what
i
mean
when
i
say
that
the
work
of
the
pupil
in
technic
and
in
musical
appreciation
should
go
hand
in
hand
from
the
beginning
iv
the
use
of
the
pedal
is
an
art
in
itself
unfortunately
with
many
it
is
an
expedient
to
shield
deficiency
a
cloak
to
cover
up
inaccuracy
and
poor
touch
it
is
employed
as
the
veils
that
fading
dowagers
adopt
to
obscure
wrinkles
the
pedal
is
even
more
than
a
medium
of
coloring
it
provides
the
background
so
indispensable
in
artistic
playing
imagine
a
picture
painted
without
any
background
and
you
may
have
an
inkling
of
what
the
effect
of
the
properly
used
pedal
is
in
piano
playing
it
has
always
seemed
to
me
that
it
does
in
piano
playing
what
the
wind
instruments
do
in
the
tonal
mass
of
the
orchestra
the
wind
instruments
usually
make
a
sort
of
background
for
the
music
of
the
other
instruments
one
who
has
attended
the
rehearsal
of
a
great
orchestra
and
has
heard
the
violins
rehearsed
alone
and
then
together
with
the
wind
instruments
will
understand
exactly
what
i
mean
how
and
when
to
introduce
the
pedal
to
provide
certain
effects
is
almost
the
study
of
a
lifetime
from
the
very
start
where
the
student
is
taught
the
bad
effect
of
holding
down
the
pedal
while
two
unrelated
chords
are
played
to
the
time
when
he
is
taught
to
use
the
pedal
for
the
accomplishment
of
atmospheric
effects
that
are
like
painting
in
the
most
subtle
and
delicate
shades
the
study
of
the
pedal
is
continuously
a
source
of
the
most
interesting
experiment
and
revelation
there
should
be
no
rules
governing
the
use
of
the
pedal
it
is
the
branch
of
pianoforte
playing
in
which
there
must
always
be
the
greatest
latitude
for
instance
in
the
playing
of
bach
works
on
the
modern
pianoforte
there
seems
to
have
been
a
very
great
deal
of
confusion
as
to
the
propriety
of
the
use
of
the
pedal
the
bach
music
which
is
played
now
on
the
keyboard
of
the
modern
piano
was
for
the
most
part
originally
written
for
either
the
clavier
or
for
the
organ
the
clavichord
had
a
very
short
sound
resembling
in
a
way
the
staccato
touch
on
the
piano
whereas
the
organ
was
and
is
capable
of
a
great
volume
of
sound
of
sustained
quality
due
to
the
contradictory
nature
of
these
two
instruments
and
the
fact
that
many
people
do
not
know
whether
a
composition
at
hand
was
written
for
the
clavichord
or
for
the
organ
some
of
them
try
to
imitate
the
organ
sound
by
holding
the
pedal
all
the
time
or
most
of
the
time
while
others
try
to
imitate
the
clavichord
and
refrain
from
the
use
of
the
pedal
altogether
the
extreme
theories
as
in
the
case
of
all
extreme
theories
are
undoubtedly
wrong
one
may
have
the
clavichord
in
mind
in
playing
one
piece
and
the
organ
in
mind
in
playing
another
there
can
be
nothing
wrong
about
that
but
to
transform
the
modern
pianoforte
which
has
distinctly
specific
tonal
attributes
into
a
clavichord
or
into
an
organ
must
result
in
a
tonal
abuse
the
pedal
is
just
as
much
a
part
of
the
pianoforte
as
are
the
stops
and
the
couplers
a
part
of
the
organ
or
the
brass
tangents
a
part
of
the
clavichord
it
is
artistically
impossible
to
so
camouflage
the
tone
of
the
pianoforte
as
to
make
it
sound
like
either
the
organ
or
the
clavichord
even
were
this
possible
the
clavichord
is
an
instrument
which
is
out
of
date
though
the
music
of
bach
is
still
a
part
and
parcel
of
the
musical
literature
of
the
oldest
known
specimen
of
the
clavichord
dated
is
in
the
metropolitan
museum
of
art
in
new
york
city
should
you
happen
to
view
this
instrument
you
would
realize
at
once
that
its
action
is
entirely
different
from
that
of
the
piano
just
as
its
tone
was
different
you
can
not
possibly
make
a
piano
sound
like
a
clavichord
through
any
medium
of
touch
or
pedals
therefore
why
not
play
the
piano
as
a
piano
why
try
to
do
the
impossible
thing
in
endeavoring
to
make
the
piano
sound
like
another
instrument
of
a
different
mechanism
why
not
make
a
piano
sound
like
a
piano
must
we
always
endure
listening
to
wagner
music
in
a
variety
show
and
to
strauss
waltzes
in
carnegie
hall
v
if
one
were
to
ask
me
what
is
the
indispensable
thing
in
the
education
of
a
pianist
i
would
say
of
all
a
good
guide
by
this
i
do
not
mean
merely
a
good
teacher
but
rather
a
mentor
a
pilot
who
can
and
who
will
oversee
the
early
steps
of
the
career
of
a
young
person
in
my
own
case
i
was
fortunate
in
having
a
father
a
professional
musician
who
realized
my
musical
possibilities
and
from
the
very
beginning
was
intensely
interested
in
my
career
not
merely
as
a
father
but
as
an
artist
guiding
and
piloting
every
day
of
my
early
life
fate
is
such
a
peculiar
mystery
and
the
student
in
his
young
life
can
have
but
a
slight
idea
of
what
is
before
him
in
the
future
therefore
the
need
of
a
mentor
is
essential
i
am
sure
that
my
father
was
the
author
of
a
great
deal
of
the
success
that
i
have
enjoyed
it
was
he
who
took
me
to
moszkowski
and
rubinstein
the
critical
advice
especially
that
of
rubinstein
was
invaluable
to
me
the
student
should
have
unrelenting
criticism
from
a
master
mind
even
when
it
is
caustic
as
was
von
bülow
it
may
be
very
beneficial
i
remember
once
in
the
home
of
moszkowski
that
i
played
for
von
bülow
the
taciturn
cynical
simply
crushed
me
with
his
criticism
of
my
playing
but
young
though
i
was
i
was
not
so
conceited
as
to
fail
to
realize
that
he
was
right
i
shook
hands
with
him
and
thanked
him
for
his
advice
and
criticism
von
bülow
laughed
and
said
do
you
thank
me
it
is
like
the
chicken
thanking
the
one
who
had
eaten
it
for
doing
so
von
bülow
on
that
same
day
played
in
such
a
jumbled
manner
with
his
old
stiffened
fingers
that
i
asked
moszkowski
how
in
the
world
it
might
be
possible
for
von
bülow
to
keep
a
concert
engagement
which
i
knew
him
to
have
a
few
days
later
in
berlin
moszkowski
replied
von
bülow
alone
for
that
you
do
know
him
if
he
sets
out
to
do
something
he
is
going
to
do
it
von
bülow
playing
however
was
almost
always
pedantic
although
unquestionably
scholarly
there
was
none
of
the
leonine
spontaneity
of
rubinstein
rubinstein
was
a
very
exacting
schoolmaster
at
the
piano
when
he
first
undertook
to
train
me
but
he
often
said
to
me
main
object
is
to
make
the
music
sound
right
even
though
you
have
to
play
with
your
nose
with
rubinstein
there
was
no
of
mere
method
any
method
that
would
lead
to
fine
artistic
results
to
beautiful
and
effective
performance
was
justifiable
in
his
eyes
finally
to
the
student
let
me
say
work
hard
and
strive
to
do
your
best
secure
a
reliable
mentor
if
you
can
possibly
do
so
and
depend
upon
his
advice
as
to
your
career
even
with
the
best
advice
there
is
always
the
element
of
fate
the
introduction
of
the
unknown
the
strangeness
of
coincidence
which
would
almost
make
one
believe
in
astrology
and
its
dictum
that
our
terrestrial
course
may
be
guided
by
the
stars
in
when
i
played
in
washington
as
a
child
of
eleven
i
was
introduced
to
a
young
lady
who
was
the
daughter
of
senator
james
eustis
little
did
i
dream
that
this
young
woman
of
all
the
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
girls
introduced
to
me
during
my
tours
would
some
day
be
my
wife
fate
plays
its
rôle
but
do
not
be
tempted
into
the
fallacious
belief
that
success
and
everything
else
depend
upon
fate
for
the
biggest
factor
is

all

a
foreword
this
little
book
is
compiled
from
the
questions
and
my
answers
to
them
as
they
have
appeared
during
the
past
two
years
in
the
home
since
the
questions
came
mostly
from
young
piano
students
and
cover
a
large
number
of
matters
important
to
the
study
of
the
piano
it
was
thought
that
this
republication
might
be
of
interest
to
piano
students
in
general
and
that
gathered
into
a
little
volume
they
might
form
a
new
and
perhaps
not
unwelcome
sort
of
reference
book
to
serve
as
such
and
to
facilitate
the
reader
search
for
any
particular
subject
i
have
grouped
the
questions
together
with
their
answers
under
special
headings
it
is
only
natural
however
that
a
book
of
this
character
can
not
contain
more
than
mere
suggestions
to
stimulate
the
reader
individual
thinking
positive
facts
which
can
be
found
in
books
on
musical
history
and
in
kindred
works
are
therefore
stated
only
where
they
are
needful
as
a
basis
for
the
replies
any
rule
or
advice
given
to
some
particular
person
can
not
fit
every
other
person
unless
it
is
passed
through
the
sieve
of
one
own
individual
intelligence
and
is
by
this
process
so
modified
as
to
fit
one
own
particular
case
there
are
in
addition
to
the
questions
presented
and
answered
one
or
two
points
about
that
would
naturally
not
occur
to
the
average
student
the
opportunity
to
discuss
those
here
is
too
favourable
to
be
allowed
to
pass
and
as
they
hardly
admit
of
precise
classification
i
venture
to
offer
them
here
as
a
brief
foreword
to
the
hundreds
of
students
who
at
various
times
have
asked
me
what
is
the
quickest
way
to
become
a
great
i
will
say
that
such
a
thing
as
a
royal
road
a
secret
trick
or
a
patent
method
to
quickly
become
a
great
artist
does
not
exist
as
the
world
consists
of
atoms
as
it
is
the
infinitely
small
things
that
have
forced
the
microscope
into
the
scientist
hand
so
does
art
contain
numberless
small
seemingly
insignificant
things
which
if
neglected
entirely
visit
dire
vengeance
upon
the
student
instead
of
prematurely
concerning
himself
with
his
inspiration
spirituality
genius
fancy
and
neglecting
on
their
account
the
material
side
of
piano
study
the
student
should
be
willing
to
progress
from
atom
to
atom
slowly
deliberately
but
with
absolute
certainty
that
each
problem
has
been
completely
solved
each
difficulty
fully
overcome
before
he
faces
the
next
one
leaps
there
are
none
unquestionably
it
does
sometimes
happen
that
an
artist
suddenly
acquires
a
wide
renown
in
such
a
case
his
leap
was
not
into
greatness
but
merely
into
the
public
recognition
of
it
the
greatness
must
have
been
in
him
for
some
time
before
the
public
became
aware
of
it
if
there
was
any
leaping
it
was
not
the
artist
but
the
public
that
did
it
let
us
not
close
our
eyes
to
the
fact
that
there
have
been
and
probably
always
will
be
artists
that
gain
a
wide
renown
being
great
puffery
aided
by
some
personal
eccentricity
is
quite
able
to
mislead
the
public
but
these
will
at
best
do
it
only
for
a
short
time
and
the
collapse
of
such
a
reputation
as
collapse
there
must
be
is
always
sure
and
sad
to
behold
the
buoyancy
of
mind
its
ability
to
soar
so
necessary
for
both
creative
and
interpretative
art
these
are
never
impaired
by
close
attention
to
detail
if
they
should
be
destroyed
by
attention
to
detail
it
would
not
matter
for
they
can
not
have
been
genuine
they
can
have
been
but
sentimental
imaginings
details
are
the
very
steps
which
one
by
one
lead
to
the
summit
of
art
we
should
be
careful
not
to
lift
one
foot
before
the
other
one
rests
quite
securely
upon
its
step
one
should
to
illustrate
not
be
satisfied
with
the
ability
of
getting
through
some
difficult
passage
by
the
skin
of
the
teeth
or
without
breaking
down
but
should
strive
to
be
able
to
play
it
to
toy
with
it
in
order
to
have
it
at
one
beck
and
call
in
any
variation
of
mood
so
as
to
play
it
as
it
pleases
the
mind
and
not
only
the
fingers
one
should
acquire
sovereignty
over
it
this
sovereignty
is
technique
but
technique
is
not
art
it
is
only
a
means
to
achieve
art
a
paver
of
the
path
toward
it
the
danger
of
confounding
technique
with
art
itself
is
not
inconsiderable
since
it
takes
a
long
time
to
develop
a
trustworthy
technique
and
this
prolonged
association
with
one
subject
is
apt
to
give
it
supremacy
over
all
others
in
one
mind
to
guard
against
this
serious
danger
the
student
should
above
all
never
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
music
as
does
any
other
art
springs
from
our
innate
craving
for
individual
expression
as
is
transmitted
from
man
to
man
by
verbal
language
so
are
feelings
emotions
moods
crystallized
into
conveyed
by
music
the
effects
of
music
may
therefore
be
ennobling
and
refining
but
they
can
as
easily
be
degrading
and
demoralizing
for
the
saints
and
sinners
among
are
probably
in
the
same
proportion
as
among
the
followers
of
other
professions
the
ethical
value
of
music
depends
therefore
not
upon
the
musician
technique
but
solely
upon
his
moral
tendencies
the
student
should
never
strive
to
dazzle
his
auditor
ear
with
mere
technical
brilliancy
but
should
endeavour
to
gladden
his
heart
to
refine
his
feelings
and
sensibilities
by
transmitting
noble
musical
thoughts
to
his
mind
he
should
scorn
all
unnecessary
charlatanish
externalities
and
strive
ever
for
the
inwardness
of
the
composition
he
interprets
for
in
being
honest
to
the
composition
he
will
also
be
honest
to
himself
and
thus
consciously
or
not
express
his
own
best
self
if
all
musicians
were
sincere
in
this
endeavour
there
could
be
neither
envy
nor
jealousy
among
them
advancing
hand
in
hand
toward
their
common
ideal
they
could
not
help
being
of
mutual
assistance
to
each
other
art
not
unlike
religion
needs
an
altar
around
which
its
devotees
may
congregate
liszt
in
his
day
had
erected
such
an
altar
in
weimar
and
as
its
high
priest
he
stood
himself
before
it
a
luminous
example
of
devotion
to
art
rubinstein
did
the
same
in
petersburg
out
of
these
atmospheres
thanks
to
the
inspiring
influences
of
liszt
and
rubinstein
wonderful
personalities
there
have
emerged
a
large
number
of
highly
meritorious
and
some
eminent
artists
that
many
of
them
have
lacked
the
power
in
their
later
life
to
withstand
the
temptations
of
quick
material
gain
by
descending
to
a
lower
plane
is
to
be
regretted
but
such
is
life
many
are
called
but
few
are
chosen
since
those
days
several
of
these
many
have
attempted
to
create
similar
centres
in
europe
they
failed
because
they
were
not
serving
art
but
rather
made
art
serve
their
own
worldly
purposes
the
artists
of
talent
no
longer
group
themselves
around
the
man
of
genius
perhaps
he
is
not
to
be
found
just
now
each
little
celebrity
among
the
pianists
keeps
nowadays
a
shop
of
his
own
and
all
to
himself
many
of
these
shops
are
mints
and
some
of
them
produce
counterfeits
as
a
matter
of
course
this
separative
system
precludes
all
unification
of
artistic
principles
and
is
therefore
very
harmful
to
the
present
generation
of
students
the
honest
student
who
will
discriminate
between
these
sometimes
cleverly
masked
counterfeit
mints
and
a
real
art
altar
must
be
of
a
character
in
which
high
principles
are
natively
ingrained
it
might
help
him
somewhat
to
remember
that
when
there
is
no
good
to
choose
we
can
always
reject
the
bad
what
is
true
of
teachers
is
just
as
true
of
compositions
the
student
should
not
listen
to
should
not
at
least
repeat
the
hearing
of
bad
compositions
though
they
may
be
called
symphonies
or
operas
and
he
can
in
a
considerable
measure
rely
upon
his
own
instincts
in
this
matter
he
may
not
and
probably
will
not
fully
fathom
the
depths
of
a
new
symphony
at
its
first
hearing
but
he
must
have
received
general
impressions
of
sufficient
power
and
clearness
to
make
him
for
another
hearing
when
this
wish
is
absent
he
should
not
hear
the
work
again
from
a
mere
sense
of
duty
it
were
far
wiser
to
avoid
another
hearing
for
habit
is
a
strong
factor
and
if
we
accustom
our
ear
to
hear
cacophonous
music
we
are
apt
to
lose
our
aversion
to
it
which
is
tantamount
to
a
loss
of
good
natural
taste
it
is
with
much
of
modern
music
as
it
is
with
opium
morphine
and
other
deadly
drugs
we
should
shun
their
very
touch
these
musical
opiates
are
sometimes
manufactured
by
persons
of
considerable
renown
of
such
quickly
gained
renown
as
may
be
acquired
nowadays
by
the
employment
of
commercialistic
methods
a
possibility
for
which
the
venal
portion
of
the
public
press
must
bear
part
of
the
blame
the
student
should
not
be
deceived
by
names
of
which
the
general
familiarity
is
of
too
recent
a
date
i
repeat
that
he
should
rather
consult
his
own
feelings
and
by
following
them
contribute
his
modest
share
toward
sending
some
of
the
present
moderns
back
into
their
deserved
obscurity
and
insignificance
i
use
the
term
moderns
advisedly
for
the
true
masters
some
of
whom
died
but
recently
have
never
stooped
to
those
methods
of
at
which
i
hinted
their
places
of
honour
were
accorded
to
them
by
the
world
because
they
were
theirs
by
right
of
their
artistic
power
their
genius
and
the
purity
of
their
art
my
advice
to
the
students
and
to
all
lovers
of
music
is
hold
on
with
all
your
might
to
the
school
of
sincerity
and
chastity
in
music
it
is
saner
and
morally
and
æsthetically
safer
than
the
entire
pack
of
our
present
aye
and
modernists
music
should
always
elevate
it
should
always
call
forth
what
according
to
the
demands
of
time
and
place
is
best
in
us
when
instead
of
serving
this
divine
mission
it
speculates
upon
and
arouses
our
lowest
instincts
for
no
better
purpose
than
to
fill
the
pockets
of
its
perpetrator
it
should
receive
neither
the
help
nor
the
encouraging
attention
of
any
and
man
or
woman
passive
resistance
can
do
a
good
deal
on
these
premises
the
matter
of
abstention
from
a
certain
type
of
music
recalls
to
my
mind
another
evil
from
which
americans
should
abstain
it
is
the
curious
and
superstition
that
music
can
be
studied
abroad
better
than
here
while
their
number
is
not
very
large
i
personally
can
name
five
american
teachers
who
have
struggled
here
for
many
a
year
without
gaining
that
high
recognition
which
they
deserve
and
now
now
they
are
in
the
various
capitals
of
europe
receiving
the
highest
fees
that
were
ever
paid
for
instruction
and
they
receive
these
high
fees
from
american
students
that
throng
their
studios
that
the
indifference
of
their
compatriots
drove
these
men
practically
out
of
their
country
proved
to
be
of
advantage
to
them
but
how
ought
those
to
be
regarded
who
failed
to
keep
them
here
the
wrong
is
irreparable
in
so
far
as
these
men
do
not
think
of
returning
to
america
except
as
visitors
the
duty
of
american
students
and
lovers
of
good
music
is
to
see
to
it
that
such
capable
teachers
as
still
here
should
here
the
mass
of
emigration
to
europe
of
our
music
students
should
cease
if
a
student
has
what
is
understood
by
finished
his
studies
here
and
his
teacher
sets
him
free
he
may
make
a
reconnoitring
tour
in
europe
the
change
of
views
and
customs
will
no
doubt
broaden
his
mind
in
certain
directions
but
musically
speaking
he
will
be
sure
to
find
that
most
of
the
enchantment
of
europe
was
due
to
its
distance
excepting
the
excellent
orchestras
of
europe
and
speaking
of
the
general
there
it
is
at
present
not
quite
as
good
as
it
is
here
neither
is
the
average
music
teacher
in
europe
a
whit
better
than
the
man
of
equal
standing
here
americans
should
take
cognizance
of
the
fact
that
their
country
has
not
stood
still
in
music
any
more
than
in
any
other
direction
each
year
has
recorded
an
advancing
step
in
its
development
we
must
cease
to
compare
the
europe
of
with
the
america
of
fifty
years
ago
at
present
there
is
an
astonishingly
large
number
of
clever
and
capable
musicians
in
america
and
as
with
good
physicians
and
lawyers
their
ability
usually
stands
in
inverse
proportion
to
the
amount
of
their
advertising
it
is
these
worthy
teachers
for
whose
sake
the
superstition
of
studying
abroad
should
be
foresworn
what
uncle
sam
has
in
the
field
of
music
not
directly
produced
he
has
acquired
by
the
natural
law
of
attraction
now
that
so
many
talented
and
learned
instructors
both
native
and
foreign
are
here
they
should
be
given
a
fair
opportunity
to
finish
a
pupil
development
as
far
as
a
teacher
can
do
it
instead
of
seeing
him
rush
off
to
europe
if
i
were
not
convinced
that
a
change
on
this
score
is
possible
i
should
not
have
devoted
so
many
words
to
it
it
is
merely
a
question
of
making
a
start
let
me
hope
that
each
reader
of
this
little
book
may
start
this
change
or
that
if
already
started
he
will
foster
and
help
it
if
his
efforts
should
be
disparaged
by
some
he
need
not
feel
disheartened
but
remember
that
he
belongs
to
the
land
of
limitless
possibilities

the
lack

however
may
be
due

of

advise
you
to

by

such
attempts
that
schumann
rendered
his

the
best
i
can
recommend
is
that
before
playing
you
soak
your
hands
in
rather
hot
water
for
several
minutes
and
then
while
still
in
the
water
stretch
the
fingers
of

with
the
other

doing
this

you
will

what

with

without
a
perceptible
jerk
when

how
can
i
overcome
the
unevenness
in
answering
this
question
i
am
in
the
position
of
a
physician
who
is
expected
to
prescribe
a
treatment
for
a
patient
whom
he
has
neither
examined
nor
even
seen
i
can
therefore
advise
only
in
a
very
general
way
as
i
have
done
with
many
questions
to
avoid
the
eventuality
of
being
confronted
by
an
exceptional
case
the
cause
of
the
hand
unrest
in
the
passing
of
the
thumb
lies
usually
in
transferring
the
thumb
too
late
the
thumb
waits
usually
until
the
very
moment
when
it
is
needed
and
then
quickly
jumps
upon
the
proper
key
instead
of
moving
toward
it
as
soon
as
the
last
key
it
touched
can
be
released
this
belatedness
causes
a
jerky
motion
of
the
arm
and
imparts
it
to
the
hand
another
cause
lies
in
a
fault
no
less
grave
than
the
first
since
the
hand
has
only
five
fingers
while
the
scale
numbers
many
notes
according
to
its
length
the
player
must
replenish
his
fingers
by
passing
the
thumb
under
the
hand
so
as
to
form
a
conjunction
between
the
notes
played
and
those
to
be
played
this
passing
of
the
thumb
conditions
a
change
or
shifting
of
the
hand
toward
the
keys
to
follow
but
the
shifting
of
the
hand
must
not
coincide
with
the
passing
of
the
thumb
or
the
result
will
be
a
jerk
the
position
of
the
hand
in
relation
to
the
keyboard
must
not
change
it
must
remain
the
same
until
the
thumb
has
struck
its
new
key
not
until
then
must
the
shifting
of
the
hand
take
place
in
this
way
the
jumpiness
or
jerkiness
of
the
scale
can
be
avoided
provided
one
can
follow
this
precept
punctiliously
which
is
not
an
easy
matter
especially
in
great
speed

why
are
those

difficult

relation
between

exactly
similar
to
that
of

from
sad
experience
it
is

more
important

when

must
refrain
from
its
use

there
is
the
slightest
danger
of
unintentional
mingling
of
tones
this
is
best
avoided
by
taking
the

striking
the
tone
upon
which
it
is
to
act
and
to
release
it
promptly
and
simultaneously
with
the
striking
of
the
next
tone
it
may
be
at
once
taken
again
and
this
alternation
must
be
kept
up
where
there
is
either
a
change
of
harmony
or
a
succession
of
passing
notes
this
is
the
only
positive
rule
i
can
give
but
even
this
is
often
violated

knowing
this

i
may
say
that
the

a

hence
the

must
now
be

it

a

other

for
himself
either
by

best

it

is
it
not

that
one
gets
stale
studying

for
a
long
time
do
you
advise
practising
with

without
the

slow
practice
is
undoubtedly
the
basis
for
quick
playing
but
quick
playing
is
not
an
immediate
result
of
slow
practice
quick
playing
must
be
tried
from
time
to
time
with
increasing
frequency
and
heightened
speed
even
at
a
temporary
loss
of
clearness
this
loss
is
easily
regained
by
subsequent
returns
to
slow
practice
after
all
we
must
first
learn
to
think
quickly
through
the
course
of
a
piece
before
we
can
play
it
quickly
and
this
mental
endeavour
too
will
be
greatly
aided
by
occasional
trials

a
quicker

your

purpose

associating

playing

to
what
extent

is
as
important
in
piano
playing
as
in
all
physical
exertion
and
more
so
when
we
speak
of
pieces
that
entail
the
use
of
great
muscular
force
for
this
causes
a
quickening
in
the
action
of
the
heart
respiration
naturally
keeps
step
with
it
and
the
result
is
often
a
forcible
breathing
through
the
mouth
players
resort
to
breathing
in
such
cases
because
they
can
not
help
themselves
if
at
the
last
spurt
of
a
bicycle
race
we
should
call
to
the
wheelmen
breathe
through
the
nose
we
could
not
wonder
if
our
advice
remains
unheeded
this
breathing
however
need
not
be
learned
it
is
the
of
nature
i
recommend
breathing
through
the
nose
as
long
as
possible
it
is
more
wholesome
than

it
refreshes
the
head
more
when

neither

two

is
why
not

only
say
that
the
circle
of
fifths
would
not
be
complete
without
the
seven
scales
in
sharps

the

keys

compositions
in

considered
more
brilliant
than
those
in

do
composers
consider
modulation
in
selecting

the
answer
to
your
question
hinges
upon
whether
you
recognize
in
music
mere
or
whether
you
concede
a
mental
and
psychic
side
to
it
in
the
former
case
the
mode
of
spelling
a
tone
or
would
be
indeed
irrelevant
but
in
the
latter
case
you
must
admit
the
necessity
of
a
musical
orthography
qualified
to
convey
distinct
tonal
meanings
and
musical
thoughts
to
the
reader
and
to
the
player
though
there
is
in
the
tempered
scale
no
difference
between
and
the
musical
reader
will
conceive
them
as
different
from
one
another

because
of
their
connection

in

it

importance
to
repeat
the

of
the

in
order
that
the
two

as

as
their
tributaries
may
well
impress
themselves
upon
the
mind
and

of
your

this
is
accomplished
he
can
not
possibly
understand

follow
their

in
the

the

is
not
the
only
one
to
be
repeated
you
will
find
frequently

the

you
may
start
with

you
ought
soon
to
turn
to
bach

some
of

the

prelude
perfectly

it

in

order
should

if
you
should
really
have
the
laudable
intention
to
study
all
the
sonatas
of
beethoven
for
your

i
should
think
that
you
may
safely
take
them
up
very
much
in
the
order
in
which
they
are
printed
with
the
exception
of

the

which
spiritually
as
well
as
technically
rank
with
the

sonata
i
have
not

anything

in
any
of

movements
is
it
because
i
do
not
understand
it
or
is
the
name
a
mere
amateurish
invention
the
name
pastoral
sonata
could
no
doubt
be
traced
to
an
arbitrary
invention
perhaps
of
some
publisher
endeavouring
to
heighten
the
attractiveness
of
the
sonata
to
the
general
public
by
the
addition
of
a
suggestive
title
yet
it
seems
to
fit
the
sonata
pretty
well
because
really
its
main
characteristic
is
a
rural
sort
of
peaceful
repose
especially
the
first
movement
is
of
a
tranquillity
which
surely
does
not
suggest
the
life
of
a
metropolis
but
in
the
other
movements
too
there
are
many
episodes
which
by
their
naïveté
and
boisterousness
indicate
the
life
of
the

few
well
played
are
must
i
play
all
the

to
become
a
good

or
is
a
certain
number
of
them
sufficient
and
if
so
how
many
would
you
advise
since
the
playing
of
all
the
sonatas
does
not
necessarily
prove
that
they
were
all
well
played
i
think
it
is
better
to
play
one
sonata
well
than
to
play
many
of
them
badly
nor
should
beethoven
sonatas
be
regarded
as
a
musical

rather
as
musical

they
are

not

is

i
believe
none
of

your

will
largely
depend
upon
the
state
of
your
technique
to
the
second
question
my
reply
is
that
chopin
has
composed
music
which
as
you
know
represents
thoughts
only
in
a
musical
sense
otherwise
it
deals
with
purely
psychic
processes

etc
the
humour
of
this
impromptu
is
mainly
an
amiable
ingratiating
one
here
and
there
slightly
tinged
with
a
sweet
melancholy
it
should
not
be
played
too
fast
for
it
easily
loses
this
latter
attribute
and
then
sounds
like
a
czerny
exercise
a
moderate
tempo
will
also
tend
to
bring
out

as
to
the
order
in
which
the
masters
of
piano
composition
should
be
studied
to
classify
composers
without
specifying
their
works
is
never
advisable
beethoven
first
and
last
sonatas
differ
so
fundamentally
from
each
other
in
every
particular
that
one
may
play
the
first
one
very
well
and
yet
be
for
many
years
perhaps
forever
unable
to
play
the
last
one
and
still
it
is
the
same
beethoven
that
wrote
both
works
we
can
therefore
hardly
speak
of
an
order
of
composers
so
long
as
we
are
dealing
with
masters
the
question
should
not
be
which
master
but
which
composition
does
your
stage
of
mental
and
technical
development
call
for
if
you
will
defer
the
study
of
any
other
composer
until
you
have
fully
mastered
the
works
of
beethoven
only

greatest
composers
as
is
it
true
that
nearly
all
the

have
been
pianists

by
pianists
you
mean
musicians
whose
sole
medium
of
audible
musical
utterance
was
the

your

admits
of
no
other
than
an
affirmative

i
can
think
of
just
now
was
berlioz
there
were
no
doubt
others
but
none
who
belongs
to
the
truly
great
ones
the
reason
for
this
is
perhaps
the
circumstance
that
the
pianist
throughout
his
education
is
brought
into
touch
with
greater
polyphony
than
the
players
of
other
instruments
and
that
polyphony
is
a
basic
principle

that

study
harmony
in
connection
with
my
piano
my
teacher
wants
me
to
do
it
but
i
do
see
the
use
of
what
benefit
is
harmony
of
what
benefit
is
the
general
a
child
has
to
go
through
to
play
the
piano
well
a
good
hand
and
so
many
hours
of
practice
are
not
sufficient
it
requires
a
general
musical
education
this
means
first
and
foremost
a
knowledge
of
harmony
to
which
you
may
later
add
the
study
of
counterpoint
and
forms
your
teacher
is
absolutely
right
sidenote
on
would
you
care
to
recommend
two
or
three
of
the
best
books
on
the
study
of
harmony
the
doctrine
of
harmony
is
ever
the
same
but
the
modes
of
teaching
it
are
constantly
changing
and
i
trust
improving
for
this
reason
i
feel
a
certain
hesitation
in
recommending
at
this
time
the
which
i
studied
many
years
ago
especially
as
i
am
not
certain
that
they
have
been
translated
into
english
i
advise
you
therefore
to
inquire
of
some
good
teacher
of
harmony
or
at
least
of
a
reliable
music
publisher
or
dealer
richter
and
büssler
wrote
works
of
recognized
merit
which
though
no
longer
modern
may
be
safely
studied
sidenote
to
is
it
possible
to
learn
modulating
from
a
book
without
the
aid
of
a
teacher
so
as
to
connect
two
pieces
of
different
tonality
possible
yes
but
not
probable
for
since
in
your
written
exercises
you
are
likely
to
err
at
times
you
will
need
some
one
to
point
out
your
errors
and
so
show
you
the
way
to
correct
them
generally
speaking
i
do
not
think
much
of
studying
the
rudiments
of
anything
without
the
aid
of
an
experienced
adviser
sidenote
counterpoint
by
one
is
it
possible
to
study
counterpoint
without
a
teacher
and
if
so
what
book
can
you
recommend
for
its
study
it
is
quite
possible
provided
you
are
certain
never
to
misunderstand
your
and
never
to
commit
any
errors
otherwise
you
will
need
the
advice
of
an
experienced
musician
in
correcting
them
a
good
teacher
however
is
always
better
than
a
book
for
this
study
of
there
are
a
great
many
any
reliable
music
house
will
furnish
you
with
a

students
try
to

besides
my

of
the

shall
i
try
to

if
i
feel
the
inclination
and
believe
i
have
some
talent
for
it
the

of

will
always
facilitate
your
work
of
reconstructing

is
practically
what
the

hence
i
advise
every

who
feels
able

construct
even
a
modest
little
piece
to
try
his
hand
at
it
of
course
if
you

will
not
enable
you

there
may
be
little
places
in
the

that
will
clear
up
in
your

more
quickly
when
you
have
come
in

with
the
technical

of
putting
down
on

has

you
will
altogether
lose

to
the

that
kind
from
which
i
could
learn

learn

is
the

for

sidenote
difference
between
major
and
minor
what
is
the
difference
between
the
major
and
minor
scale
does
it
lie
in
the
arrangement
of
semitones
or
in
the
character
or
in
both
there
are
three
differences
first
in
the
arrangement
of
the
semitones
second
in
the
character
and
third
in
the
circumstance
that
the
minor
scale
admits
of
a
number
of
modifications
for
melodic
purposes
which
can
not
be
made
in

major
scale
sidenote
is
only
one
minor
which
is
the
true

scale
the
melodic
or
the
harmonic
my

insists
upon
the
harmonic
but
it
sounds
ugly
to
me
will
you
please
tell
me
something
about
it
there
is
but
one
minor
scale
it
is
the
one
upon
which
the
chords
of
its
tonality
are
built
it
is
the
one
upon
which
your
teacher
wisely
insists
because
the
melodic
minor
scale
offers
no
new
intervals
to
your
fingers
and
because
the
term
melodic
minor
scale
is
applied
to
that
form
of
deviation
from
the
real
scale
which
is
most
frequently
used
but
which
is
by
no
means
the
only
deviation
that
is
possible
nor
is
it
the
only
one
in
use
sidenote
is
the
difference
between
the

minor
scales
what
is
the
difference
between
the
major
and
minor
scales
the
major
scale
has
a
major
third
and
sixth
while
the
minor
scale
has
a
minor
third
and
sixth
and
raises
its
seventh
to
a
major
seventh
by
an
accidental
elevating
sign
raising
a
natural
note
by
a
sharp
and
a
flat
note
by
a
natural
if
you
begin
your
major
scale
upon
its
sixth
degree
and
counting
it
as
the
first
of
the
minor
raise
the
seventh
you
obtain
the
minor
scale
in
which
however
many
modifications
are
admissible
for
melodic
though
not
for
harmonic
purposes

waltz
menuet
mazurka
and

as
a
waltz
and
a

are
both
in

is
it
only
the

in
which
they
differ
or
are
there
other
differences
waltz
menuet
mazurka
and
polonaise
are
all
in
time
and
are
not
confined
to
a
definite

the
difference
between
them
lies
in
the
structure
a
waltz
period
that
is
the
full
expression
of
a

sixteen
measures
a

needs
only
eight
a

only
four

in
a
mazurka
a

occupies
only
one

in
the

two
and
in
the
waltz
four
the
polonaise
subdivides
its
quarters
into
eighths
and
the
second
eighth
usually
into
two
sixteenths
it
differs
therefore
from
the
other
three
dances
by
its
rhythm
sidenote
meaning
of
toccata
what
is
the
meaning
of
the
word
toccata
i
do
not
find
it
in
the
italian
lexicon
and
the
english
musical
dictionaries
differ
widely
in
their
definitions
none
of
their
definitions
seems
to
apply
to
the
toccata
by
chaminade
to
make
the
matter
quite
plain
let
me
say
first
that
cantata
from
to
sing
meant
in
olden
times
a
music
piece
to
be
sung
while
sonata
from
to
play
designated
a
piece
to
be
played
on
an
instrument
and
toccato
meant
a
piece
for
keyboard
instruments
like
the
organ
or
piano
and
its
precursors
written
with
the
intention
of
providing
special
opportunities
for
the
display
of
the
skill
of
touch
from
to
touch
or
as
we
would
now
say
finger
technique
the
original
meanings
have
changed
so
that
these
terms
now
imply
definite
forms
like
the
modern
cantata
and
sonata
the
toccata
is
at
present
understood
to
be
a
piece
in
constant
and
regular
motion
very
much
like
those
that
are
called
or
perpetual
motion
of
which
weber
perpetuum
mobile
is
a
good
example
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
toccata
by
chaminade
which
i
do
not
know
is
written
on
similar
lines
the

absolutely
essential
to
a

playing
from

is
indispensable
to
the
freedom
of
rendition
you
have
to
bear
in
your
mind
and
memory
the
whole
piece
in
order
to
attend
properly
to
its
details
some
renowned
players
who
take
the
printed
sheets
before
them
on
the
stage
play
nevertheless
from
memory
they
take
the
music
with
them
only
to
heighten
their
feeling
of
security
and
to
counteract
a
lack
of
confidence
in
their
memory
a
species
of
nervousness

easiest
way
to
will
you
please
tell
me
which
is
the
easiest
way
to

a
piano

begin
by
playing
it
a
few
times
very
carefully
and
slowly
until
you
can
play
it
with
a
fair
degree
of
exactitude
you
need
not
mind
an
occasional
stopping
then
go
over
such
places
as
appeared
to
you
especially
complex
until
you
understand
their
construction
now
let
the
piece
rest
for
a
whole
day
and
try
to
trace
in
your
mind
the
train
of
thoughts
in
the
piece
should
you
come
to
a
dead
stop
be
satisfied
with
what
you
have
achieved
your
mind
will
keep
on
working
subconsciously
as
over
a
puzzle
always
trying
to
find
the
continuation
if
you
find
that
the
memory
is
a
blank
take
the
music
in
hand
look
at
the
particular
place
but
only
at
this
and
since
you
have
now
found
the
connection
continue
the
work
of
mental
tracing
at
the
next
stop
repeat
this
procedure
until
you
have
reached
the
end
not
in
every
detail
but
in
large
outlines
of
course
this
does
not
mean
that
you
can
now
it
from
memory
you
have
only
arrived
at
the
point
of
transition
from
the
imagined
to
the
real
and
now
begins
a
new
kind
of
study
to
transfer
to
the
instrument
what
you
have
mentally
absorbed
try
to
do
this
piece
by
piece
and
look
into
the
printed
sheets
which
should
not
be
on
the
but
away
from
it
only
when
your
memory
absolutely
refuses
to
go
on
the
real
work
with
the
printed
music
should
be
reserved
to
the
last
and
you
should
regard
it
in
the
light
of
a
of
your
mental
impressions
the
whole
process
of
absorbing
a
piece
of
music
mentally
resembles
that
of
photographing
the
development
of
the
acoustic
picture
the
is
like
the
bath
the
tentative
playing
is
like
the
process
of
fixing
against
sensitiveness

lights

the

with
the

is
the
retouching
sidenote
order

it
very
hard

can
you
suggest
any
method
that
would
make
it
easier
to
retain
in
one
memory
what
does
not
interest
one
is
difficult
to
everybody
while
that
which
does
interest
us
comes
easy
in
your
case
the
first
requirement
seems
to
be
that
your
interest
in
the
pieces
you
are
to
play
be
awakened
this
interest
usually
comes
with
a
deeper
understanding
of
music
hence
it
may
be
said
that
nothing
will
assist
a
naturally
reluctant
memory
so
much
as
a
general
musical
education
special
studies
for
the
memory
have
not
come
to
my
knowledge
because
i
never
had
any
need
of
them
after
all
the
best
way
to
memorize
is
to
memorize
one
phrase
another
and
so
on
until
the
memory
grows
by
its
own
force
through
being
exercised
sidenote
quickly
and
forgetting
as
i
memorize
very
easily
so
that
i
can
often
play
my
pieces
from
memory
before
i
have
fully
mastered
their
technical
difficulties
as
my
teacher
says
but
i
forget
them
just
as
quickly
so
that
in
a
few
weeks
i
can
not
remember
enough
of
them
to
play
them
clear
through
what
would
you
advise
to
make
my
memory
more
retentive
there
are
two
fundamental
types
of
memory
one
is
very
mobile
it
acquires
quickly
and
loses
just
as
quickly
the
other
is
more
cumbrous
in
its
action
it
acquires
slowly
but
retains
forever
a
combination
of
the
two
is
very
rare
indeed
i
never
heard
of
such
a
case
a
remedy
against
forgetting
you
will
find
in
refreshing
your
memory
in
regular
periods
playing
your
memorized
pieces
over
carefully
every
four

five
days

must
have
what
is

a

sidenote
problem
of
transposing
at
what
please
is
the
quickest
and
safest
way
of
transposing
from
one
key
to
another
i
have
trouble
for
instance
in
playing
for
singing
if
the
piece
is
in
a
major
and
the
singer
wants
it
in
f
major
the
question
of
transposing
hinges
on
the
process
of
hearing
through
the
eye
i
mean
by
this
that
you
must
study
the
piece
until
you
learn
to
conceive
the
printed
music
as
sounds
and
sound
groups
not
as
key
pictures
then
transfer
the
sound
picture
to
another
tonality
in
your
mind
very
much
as
if
when
moving
from
one
floor
to
another
with
all
your
household
goods
you
were
to
place
them
on
the
new
floor
as
they
were
placed

the
old
practice
will
of
course
facilitate
this
process
very
much
transposition
at

is
based
on
somewhat
different
principles
here
you
have
to
get
mentally
settled
in
the
new
tonality
and
then
follow
the
course
of
intervals
if
you
find
transposition
difficult
you
may
derive
consolation
from
the
thought
that
it
is
difficult
for
everybody
and
that
transposing
at
sight
is
of
course
still
more
difficult
than
to
transpose

studying
the

must
learn
to
discard
all

of
your

as

avoid

there

the

of

lies
not

in

are

i

that
the

rather
upon

perhaps

that

ask
the

then
adapt
these

explain
how
to
go
about
publishing
a
piece
of
music
and
also
give
the
name
of
some
good

it

very
easy
to
publish

if
the

sees
any
merit
in
it
send
your

to

house
whose

you
find
on
the

the

advisers
of
the

will
report
to
their
chief

to
the
merit
of
your

he
will
then
decide
and
negotiate
with
you
if
his
decision
is
favourable
if
he
should
not
care
for
it
he
will
return
your

you
may
try

advise

to
obtain

playing

what
is

playing
in
rhythm
refers
to
the
inner
life
of
a

to

playing

means

it

be

that
your

phase
of
a
general
slowness
there
is
but
one
remedy
for
that
you

you
should
have

sidenote
as
my
child
of
five
years
of
age
shows
signs
of
great
talent
for
music
he
has
a
keen
true
ear
and
plays
rather
well
for
his
age
does
this
justify
me
in
hoping
that
something
out
of
the
ordinary
will
become
of
him
they
say
that
never
amount
to
anything
in

life
that
never
amount
to
anything
in
later
life
is
not
borne
out
by
history
if
some
are
disappointments
it
is
either
because
they
astonished
by
mere
executive
precocity
instead
of
charming
by
their
talent
or
because
they
were
ruined
by
unscrupulous
parents
or
managers
who
confounded
the
promise
of
a
future
with
its
realization

aside
from
these

all
the
others
will
bear
me
out
in
this
statement
if
your

shows
more
than
mere
precocity
if
for
instance
he
does
not
merely
play
in
his
fifth
year
what
others
play
in
their
tenth
but
shows
qualities
of
musical
superiority

you

or
shall
i
give
preference
to

by
all
means
attend

and
concerts
for
these
will
acquaint
you
with
those
works
which
are
after
all
of
the
greatest
importance
to
the
student
besides
you
will
usually
hear
more
correct
interpretations
than
from
soloists
the
latter
with
some
luminous
exceptions
overestimate
their
own
authority
and
take
such
unseemly
liberties
that
in
many
cases
you
hear
more
smith
jones
or
levy
than
beethoven
schumann
or
chopin
individuality
in
a
soloist
is
certainly
a
great
quality
but
only
if
it
is
tempered
by
a
proper
deference
to
the
composer
of
the
work
in
hand
if
you
can
not
hear
a
soloist
who
is
capable
of
sinking
his
individuality
in
the
thought
mood
and
style
of
the
composer
he
is
interpreting
and
this
is
given
to
only
the
very
greatest

do
far
better
to
prefer
to
the
individual
renditions
of
a
soloist
the
collective
renditions
of
the
orchestra
or
string
quartette
the
synthetic
nature
of
the
orchestra
forestalls
the
extravagances
of
individuality
and
insures
generally
speaking
a
truthful
interpretation
the
very
worst
conductor
imaginable
can
not
do
as
much
harm
to
a
composition
as
can
a
mediocre
soloist
for
an
orchestra
is
a
large
body
and
therefore
not
so
easily
moved
and
shifted
from
the
path
of
musical
rectitude
as
is
a
single
voice
or
an
instrument
a
really
great
soloist
is
of
course
the
finest
flower
of
the
garden
of
applied
music
for
his
touch
with
the
instrument
is
immediate
and
he
needs
no
middleman
to
express
the
finest
shades
of
his
conceptions
while
the
conductor
and
even
the
best
has
to
impart
his
conception
through
the
baton
facial
expression
and
gesture
to
other
people
before
it
can
become
audible
and
on
this
circuitous
route
much
of
the
original
fervour
and
ardour
may
be
lost
but
there
are
more
good
orchestras
than
great
soloists
and
hence
you
are
safe
in
attending
orchestra
and
concerts

whether

choose
music

is

or
should
he
keep
his

your

the

before
you

me
to
advise

the

nowadays
is
not
so
simple
as
it
appears
to
be
of
a
thousand
capable
musicians
there
is
perhaps
one
who
attains
to
a
general
reputation
and
fortune
the
rest
of
them
after
spending
money

and
toil
give
up
in
despair
and
with
an
embittered
disposition
take
up
some
other
occupation
if
you
do
not
depend
upon
public
for
a
living
if
your
natural
endowments
are
not
of
a
very
unusually
high
order
and
if
your
entire
personality
does
not
imply
the
exercise
of
authority
over
assemblages
of
people
spiritual
authority
i
mean
it
were
better
to
enjoy
your
music
in
the
circle
of
your
friends
it
is
less
risky
and
will
in
all
probability
give
you
much
greater
satisfaction
sidenote
much
you
can
get
from
when
i
hear
a

i
want

ear
enjoyment
can
you
give
me
a
little
outline
of
points
for
which
to
look
that
may
help
me
in
my

study
there
is
no
pleasure
or
enjoyment
from
which
we
can
derive
more
than
we
bring
with
us
in
the
way
of
receptiveness
as
you
deepen
your
study
of
music
and
gain
insight
into
its
forms
contrapuntal
work
and
harmonic
beauties
you
will
derive
more
and
more
pleasure
from
listening
to
a
good
pianist
the
deeper
your
studies
go

their
playing
reflects
of
emotional
life
you
will
perceive

measure
of
your

grasp

medium

like
a
telegraph
two
stations
the
sender
of
a
message
and
the
receiver
both
must
be
pitched
equally
high
to
make
the
communication
perfect
sidenote
is
so
much
easier
to
read
flats
than
sharps
you
would
confer
a
favour
upon
a
teacher
by
solving
a
problem
for
her
that
has
puzzled
her
all
her
life
why
do
all
pupils
prefer
flats
to
sharps
i
am
not
at
all
sure
that
i
do
not
in
some
degree
share
this
preference
is
it
a
fault
of
training
or
has
it
any
other
cause
your
question
is
both
original
and
well
justified
by
frequent
observation
for
it
is
quite
true
that
people
prefer
to
read
flats
to
sharps
but
note
it
well
that
the
aversion
to
sharps
refers
only
to
the
reading
not
to
the
playing
if
any
one
should
find
it
harder
to
in
sharps
say
after
knowing
the
notes
well
it
would
be
a
purely
subjective
deception
due
to
a
mental
association
of
the
with
the
respective
sounds
my
personal
belief
is
that
the
aversion
to
the
of
sharps
is
caused
by
the
comparative
complexity
of
the
sign
itself
and
this
leads
me
to
think
that
the
whole
matter
belongs
rather
to
ophthalmology
than
to
either
acoustics
or
music
sidenote
or
liszt
which
the
greater
as
between
liszt
and
rubinstein
whom
do
you
consider
the
greater
rubinstein
i
knew
very
well
i
was
his
pupil
and
have
heard
him
play
a
great
many
times
liszt
who
died
when
i
was
sixteen
years
old
and
had
not
appeared
in
public
for
some
twenty
years
previously
i
never
met
and
never
heard
still
from
the
descriptions
which
many
of
my
friends
gave
me
of
him
and
from
the
study
of
his
works
i
have
been
able
to
form
a
fair
idea
of
his
playing
and
his
personality
as
a
virtuoso
i
think
liszt
stood
above
rubinstein
for
his
playing
must
have
possessed
amazing
dazzling
qualities
rubinstein
excelled
by
his
sincerity
by
his
demoniacal
power
of
great
impassionedness
qualities
which
with
liszt
had
passed
through
the
sieve
of
a
superior
education
and
if
you
understand
how
i
mean
that
term
gentlemanly
elegance
he
was
in
the
highest
meaning
of
the
word
a
man
of
the
world
rubinstein
a
with
a
sovereign
disregard
for
conventionality
and
for
grundy
the
principal
difference
lay
in
the
characters
of
the
two
as
musicians
with
regard
to
their
natural
endowments
and
ability
they
were
probably
of
the
same
gigantic
calibre
such
as
we
would
seek
in
vain
at
the
present
time
sidenote
to
one
composer
excluding
all
if
i
am
deeply
interested
in
beethoven

can
i
not
find
in
him
all
that
there
is
in
music
in
both
an
æsthetic
and
a
technical
sense

any
one
music
more
profound
you
imagine
yourself
in
an
impenetrable
stronghold
whence
safe
from
all
attacks
you
may
look
upon
all
composers
except
beethoven
with
a
patronizing
condescending
smile
but
you
are
gravely
in
error
life
is
too
rich
in
experience
too
in
its
manifestations
to
permit
any
one
master
however
great
to
exhaust
its
interpretation
through
his
art
if
you
base
your
preference
for
beethoven
upon
your
sympathies
and
if
for
this
reason
his
music
satisfies
you
better
than
that
of
any
other
composer
you
are
to
be
complimented
upon
your
good
taste
but
that
gives
you
no
right
to
contest
for
instance
the
profoundness
of
bach
the
æsthetic
charm
of
chopin
the
wonders
of
mozart
art
nor
the
many
and
various
merits
of
your
contemporary
composers
the
least
that
one
can
be
charged
with
who
finds
the
whole
of
life
expressed
in
any
one
composer
is
not
to
speak
of
the
fact
that
the
understanding
can
not
be
very
deep
for
one
master
if
it
is
closed
to
all

must
