introduction
the
revision
of
history
the
present
age
is
not
merely
an
epoch
of
discovery
it
is
also
a
period
of
revision
of
the
various
elements
of
knowledge
having
recognised
that
there
are
no
phenomena
of
which
the
first
cause
is
still
accessible
science
has
resumed
the
examination
of
her
ancient
certitudes
and
has
proved
their
fragility
she
sees
her
ancient
principles
vanishing
one
by
one
mechanics
is
losing
its
axioms
and
matter
formerly
the
eternal
substratum
of
the
worlds
becomes
a
simple
aggregate
of
ephemeral
forces
in
transitory
condensation
despite
its
conjectural
side
by
virtue
of
which
it
to
some
extent
escapes
the
severest
form
of
criticism
history
has
not
been
free
from
this
universal
revision
there
is
no
longer
a
single
one
of
its
phases
of
which
we
can
say
that
it
is
certainly
known
what
appeared
to
be
definitely
acquired
is
now
once
more
put
in
question
among
the
events
whose
study
seemed
completed
was
the
french
revolution
analysed
by
several
generations
of
writers
one
might
suppose
it
to
be
perfectly
elucidated
what
new
thing
can
be
said
of
it
except
in
modification
of
some
of
its
details
and
yet
its
most
positive
defenders
are
beginning
to
hesitate
in
their
judgments
ancient
evidence
proves
to
be
far
from
impeccable
the
faith
in
dogmas
once
held
sacred
is
shaken
the
latest
literature
of
the
revolution
betrays
these
uncertainties
having
related
men
are
more
and
more
chary
of
drawing
conclusions
not
only
are
the
heroes
of
this
great
drama
discussed
without
indulgence
but
thinkers
are
asking
whether
the
new
dispensation
which
followed
the
ancien
regime
would
not
have
established
itself
naturally
without
violence
in
the
course
of
progressive
civilisation
the
results
obtained
no
longer
seem
in
correspondence
either
with
their
immediate
cost
or
with
the
remoter
consequences
which
the
revolution
evoked
from
the
possibilities
of
history
several
causes
have
led
to
the
revision
of
this
tragic
period
time
has
calmed
passions
numerous
documents
have
gradually
emerged
from
the
archives
and
the
historian
is
learning
to
interpret
them
independently
but
it
is
perhaps
modern
psychology
that
has
most
effectually
influenced
our
ideas
by
enabling
us
more
surely
to
read
men
and
the
motives
of
their
conduct
among
those
of
its
discoveries
which
are
henceforth
applicable
to
history
we
must
mention
above
all
a
more
profound
understanding
of
ancestral
influences
the
laws
which
rule
the
actions
of
the
crowd
data
relating
to
the
disaggregation
of
personality
mental
contagion
the
unconscious
formation
of
beliefs
and
the
distinction
between
the
various
forms
of
logic
to
tell
the
truth
these
applications
of
science
which
are
utilised
in
this
book
have
not
been
so
utilised
hitherto
historians
have
generally
stopped
short
at
the
study
of
documents
and
even
that
study
is
sufficient
to
excite
the
doubts
of
which
i
have
spoken
the
great
events
which
shape
the
destinies
of
peoples
revolutions
for
example
and
the
outbreak
of
religious
beliefs
are
sometimes
so
difficult
to
explain
that
one
must
limit
oneself
to
a
mere
statement
from
the
time
of
my
first
historical
researches
i
have
been
struck
by
the
impenetrable
aspect
of
certain
essential
phenomena
those
relating
to
the
genesis
of
beliefs
especially
i
felt
convinced
that
something
fundamental
was
lacking
that
was
essential
to
their
interpretation
reason
having
said
all
it
could
say
nothing
more
could
be
expected
of
it
and
other
means
must
be
sought
of
comprehending
what
had
not
been
elucidated
for
a
long
time
these
important
questions
remained
obscure
to
me
extended
travel
devoted
to
the
study
of
the
remnants
of
vanished
civilisations
had
not
done
much
to
throw
light
upon
them
reflecting
upon
it
continually
i
was
forced
to
recognise
that
the
problem
was
composed
of
a
series
of
other
problems
which
i
should
have
to
study
separately
this
i
did
for
a
period
of
twenty
years
presenting
the
results
of
my
researches
in
a
succession
of
volumes
one
of
the
first
was
devoted
to
the
study
of
the
psychological
laws
of
the
evolution
of
peoples
having
shown
that
the
historic
races
that
is
the
races
formed
by
the
hazards
of
history
finally
acquired
psychological
characteristics
as
stable
as
their
anatomical
characteristics
i
attempted
to
explain
how
a
people
transforms
its
institutions
its
languages
and
its
arts
i
explained
in
the
same
work
why
it
was
that
individual
personalities
under
the
influence
of
sudden
variations
of
environment
might
be
entirely
disaggregated
but
besides
the
fixed
collectivities
formed
by
the
peoples
there
are
mobile
and
transitory
collectivities
known
as
crowds
now
these
crowds
or
mobs
by
the
aid
of
which
the
great
movements
of
history
are
accomplished
have
characteristics
absolutely
different
from
those
of
the
individuals
who
compose
them
what
are
these
characteristics
and
how
are
they
evolved
this
new
problem
was
examined
in
the
psychology
of
the
crowd
only
after
these
studies
did
i
begin
to
perceive
certain
influences
which
had
escaped
me
but
this
was
not
all
among
the
most
important
factors
of
history
one
was
preponderant
the
factor
of
beliefs
how
are
these
beliefs
born
and
are
they
really
rational
and
voluntary
as
was
long
taught
are
they
not
rather
unconscious
and
independent
of
all
reason
a
difficult
question
which
i
dealt
with
in
my
last
book
opinions
and
beliefs
so
long
as
psychology
regards
beliefs
as
voluntary
and
rational
they
will
remain
inexplicable
having
proved
that
they
are
usually
irrational
and
always
involuntary
i
was
able
to
propound
the
solution
of
this
important
problem
how
it
was
that
beliefs
which
no
reason
could
justify
were
admitted
without
difficulty
by
the
most
enlightened
spirits
of
all
ages
the
solution
of
the
historical
difficulties
which
had
so
long
been
sought
was
thenceforth
obvious
i
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
beside
the
rational
logic
which
conditions
thought
and
was
formerly
regarded
as
our
sole
guide
there
exist
very
different
forms
of
logic
affective
logic
collective
logic
and
mystic
logic
which
usually
overrule
the
reason
and
engender
the
generative
impulses
of
our
conduct
this
fact
well
established
it
seemed
to
me
evident
that
if
a
great
number
of
historical
events
are
often
uncomprehended
it
is
because
we
seek
to
interpret
them
in
the
light
of
a
logic
which
in
reality
has
very
little
influence
upon
their
genesis
all
these
researches
which
are
here
summed
up
in
a
few
lines
demanded
long
years
for
their
accomplishment
despairing
of
completing
them
i
abandoned
them
more
than
once
to
return
to
those
labours
of
the
laboratory
in
which
one
is
always
sure
of
skirting
the
truth
and
of
acquiring
fragments
at
least
of
certitude
but
while
it
is
very
interesting
to
explore
the
world
of
material
phenomena
it
is
still
more
so
to
decipher
men
for
which
reason
i
have
always
been
led
back
to
psychology
certain
principles
deduced
from
my
researches
appearing
likely
to
prove
fruitful
i
resolved
to
apply
them
to
the
study
of
concrete
instances
and
was
thus
led
to
deal
with
the
psychology
of
revolutions
notably
that
of
the
french
revolution
proceeding
in
the
analysis
of
our
great
revolution
the
greater
part
of
the
opinions
determined
by
the
reading
of
books
deserted
me
one
by
one
although
i
had
considered
them
unshakable
to
explain
this
period
we
must
consider
it
as
a
whole
as
many
historians
have
done
it
is
composed
of
phenomena
simultaneous
but
independent
of
one
another
each
of
its
phases
reveals
events
engendered
by
psychological
laws
working
with
the
regularity
of
clockwork
the
actors
in
this
great
drama
seem
to
move
like
the
characters
of
a
previously
determined
drama
each
says
what
he
must
say
acts
as
he
is
bound
to
act
to
be
sure
the
actors
in
the
revolutionary
drama
differed
from
those
of
a
written
drama
in
that
they
had
not
studied
their
parts
but
these
were
dictated
by
invisible
forces
precisely
because
they
were
subjected
to
the
inevitable
progression
of
logics
incomprehensible
to
them
we
see
them
as
greatly
astonished
by
the
events
of
which
they
were
the
heroes
as
are
we
ourselves
never
did
they
suspect
the
invisible
powers
which
forced
them
to
act
they
were
the
masters
neither
of
their
fury
nor
their
weakness
they
spoke
in
the
name
of
reason
pretending
to
be
guided
by
reason
but
in
reality
it
was
by
no
means
reason
that
impelled
them
the
decisions
for
which
we
are
so
greatly
reproached
wrote
were
more
often
than
otherwise
not
intended
or
desired
by
us
two
days
or
even
one
day
beforehand
the
crisis
alone
evoked
them
not
that
we
must
consider
the
events
of
the
revolution
as
dominated
by
an
imperious
fatality
the
readers
of
our
works
will
know
that
we
recognise
in
the
man
of
superior
qualities
the
role
of
averting
fatalities
but
he
can
dissociate
himself
only
from
a
few
of
such
and
is
often
powerless
before
the
sequence
of
events
which
even
at
their
origin
could
scarcely
be
ruled
the
scientist
knows
how
to
destroy
the
microbe
before
it
has
time
to
act
but
he
knows
himself
powerless
to
prevent
the
evolution
of
the
resulting
malady
when
any
question
gives
rise
to
violently
contradictory
opinions
we
may
be
sure
that
it
belongs
to
the
province
of
beliefs
and
not
to
that
of
knowledge
we
have
shown
in
a
preceding
work
that
belief
of
unconscious
origin
and
independent
of
all
reason
can
never
be
influenced
by
reason
the
revolution
the
work
of
believers
has
seldom
been
judged
by
any
but
believers
execrated
by
some
and
praised
by
others
it
has
remained
one
of
those
dogmas
which
are
accepted
or
rejected
as
a
whole
without
the
intervention
of
rational
logic
although
in
its
beginnings
a
religious
or
political
revolution
may
very
well
be
supported
by
rational
elements
it
is
developed
only
by
the
aid
of
mystic
and
affective
elements
which
are
absolutely
foreign
to
reason
the
historians
who
have
judged
the
events
of
the
french
revolution
in
the
name
of
rational
logic
could
not
comprehend
them
since
this
form
of
logic
did
not
dictate
them
as
the
actors
of
these
events
themselves
understood
them
but
ill
we
shall
not
be
far
from
the
truth
in
saying
that
our
revolution
was
a
phenomenon
equally
misunderstood
by
those
who
caused
it
and
by
those
who
have
described
it
at
no
period
of
history
did
men
so
little
grasp
the
present
so
greatly
ignore
the
past
and
so
poorly
divine
the
future
the
power
of
the
revolution
did
not
reside
in
the
principles
which
for
that
matter
were
anything
but
novel
which
it
sought
to
propagate
nor
in
the
institutions
which
it
sought
to
found
the
people
cares
very
little
for
institutions
and
even
less
for
doctrines
that
the
revolution
was
potent
indeed
that
it
made
france
accept
the
violence
the
murders
the
ruin
and
the
horror
of
a
frightful
civil
war
that
finally
it
defended
itself
victoriously
against
a
europe
in
arms
was
due
to
the
fact
that
it
had
founded
not
a
new
system
of
government
but
a
new
religion
now
history
shows
us
how
irresistible
is
the
might
of
a
strong
belief
invincible
rome
herself
had
to
bow
before
the
armies
of
nomad
shepherds
illuminated
by
the
faith
of
mahommed
for
the
same
reason
the
kings
of
europe
could
not
resist
the
tatterdemalion
soldiers
of
the
convention
like
all
apostles
they
were
ready
to
immolate
themselves
in
the
sole
end
of
propagating
their
beliefs
which
according
to
their
dream
were
to
renew
the
world
the
religion
thus
founded
had
the
force
of
other
religions
if
not
their
duration
yet
it
did
not
perish
without
leaving
indelible
traces
and
its
influence
is
active
still
we
shall
not
consider
the
revolution
as
a
clean
sweep
in
history
as
its
apostles
believed
it
we
know
that
to
demonstrate
their
intention
of
creating
a
world
distinct
from
the
old
they
initiated
a
new
era
and
professed
to
break
entirely
with
all
vestiges
of
the
past
but
the
past
never
dies
it
is
even
more
truly
within
us
than
without
us
against
their
will
the
reformers
of
the
revolution
remained
saturated
with
the
past
and
could
only
continue
under
other
names
the
traditions
of
the
monarchy
even
exaggerating
the
autocracy
and
centralisation
of
the
old
system
tocqueville
had
no
difficulty
in
proving
that
the
revolution
did
little
but
overturn
that
which
was
about
to
fall
if
in
reality
the
revolution
destroyed
but
little
it
favoured
the
fruition
of
certain
ideas
which
continued
thenceforth
to
develop
the
fraternity
and
liberty
which
it
proclaimed
never
greatly
seduced
the
peoples
but
equality
became
their
gospel
the
pivot
of
socialism
and
of
the
entire
evolution
of
modern
democratic
ideas
we
may
therefore
say
that
the
revolution
did
not
end
with
the
advent
of
the
empire
nor
with
the
successive
restorations
which
followed
it
secretly
or
in
the
light
of
day
it
has
slowly
unrolled
itself
and
still
affects
men
minds
the
study
of
the
french
revolution
to
which
a
great
part
of
this
book
is
devoted
will
perhaps
deprive
the
reader
of
more
than
one
illusion
by
proving
to
him
that
the
books
which
recount
the
history
of
the
revolution
contain
in
reality
a
mass
of
legends
very
remote
from
reality
these
legends
will
doubtless
retain
more
life
than
history
itself
do
not
regret
this
too
greatly
it
may
interest
a
few
philosophers
to
know
the
truth
but
the
peoples
will
always
prefer
dreams
synthetising
their
ideal
such
dreams
will
always
constitute
powerful
motives
of
action
one
would
lose
courage
were
it
not
sustained
by
false
ideas
said
fontenelle
joan
of

the
giants
of
the
convention
the

all
these
dazzling
images
of
the
past
will
always
remain
sources
of
hope
in
the
gloomy
hours
that
follow
defeat
they
form
part
of
that
patrimony
of
illusions
left
us
by
our
fathers
whose
power
is
often
greater
than
that

scientific
and

classification
of
revolutions
we
generally
apply
the
term
revolution
to
sudden
political
changes
but
the
expression
may
be
employed
to
denote
all
sudden
transformations
or
transformations
apparently
sudden
whether
of
beliefs
ideas
or
doctrines
we
have
considered
elsewhere
the
part
played
by
the
rational
affective
and
mystic
factors
in
the
genesis
of
the
opinions
and
beliefs
which
determine
conduct
we
need
not
therefore
return
to
the
subject
here
a
revolution
may
finally
become
a
belief
but
it
often
commences
under
the
action
of
perfectly
rational
motives
the
suppression
of
crying
abuses
of
a
detested
despotic
government
or
an
unpopular
sovereign
although
the
origin
of
a
revolution
may
be
perfectly
rational
we
must
not
forget
that
the
reasons
invoked
in
preparing
for
it
do
not
influence
the
crowd
until
they
have
been
transformed
into
sentiments
rational
logic
can
point
to
the
abuses
to
be
destroyed
but
to
move
the
multitude
its
hopes
must
be
awakened
this
can
only
be
effected
by
the
action
of
the
affective
and
mystic
elements
which
give
man
the
power
to
act
at
the
time
of
the
french
revolution
for
example
rational
logic
in
the
hands
of
the
philosophers
demonstrated
the
inconveniences
of
the
ancien
regime
and
excited
the
desire
to
change
it
mystic
logic
inspired
belief
in
the
virtues
of
a
society
created
in
all
its
members
according
to
certain
principles
affective
logic
unchained
the
passions
confined
by
the
bonds
of
ages
and
led
to
the
worst
excesses
collective
logic
ruled
the
clubs
and
the
assemblies
and
impelled
their
members
to
actions
which
neither
rational
nor
affective
nor
mystic
logic
would
ever
have
caused
them
to
commit
whatever
its
origin
a
revolution
is
not
productive
of
results
until
it
has
sunk
into
the
soul
of
the
multitude
then
events
acquire
special
forms
resulting
from
the
peculiar
psychology
of
crowds
popular
movements
for
this
reason
have
characteristics
so
pronounced
that
the
description
of
one
will
enable
us
to
comprehend
the
others
the
multitude
is
therefore
the
agent
of
a
revolution
but
not
its
point
of
departure
the
crowd
represents
an
amorphous
being
which
can
do
nothing
and
will
nothing
without
a
head
to
lead
it
it
will
quickly
exceed
the
impulse
once
received
but
it
never
creates
it
the
sudden
political
revolutions
which
strike
the
historian
most
forcibly
are
often
the
least
important
the
great
revolutions
are
those
of
manners
and
thought
changing
the
name
of
a
government
does
not
transform
the
mentality
of
a
people
to
overthrow
the
institutions
of
a
people
is
not
to
its
soul
the
true
revolutions
those
which
transform
the
destinies
of
the
peoples
are
most
frequently
accomplished
so
slowly
that
the
historians
can
hardly
point
to
their
beginnings
the
term
evolution
is
therefore
far
more
appropriate
than
revolution
the
various
elements
we
have
enumerated
as
entering
into
the
genesis
of
the
majority
of
revolutions
will
not
suffice
to
classify
them
considering
only
the
designed
object
we
will
divide
them
into
scientific
revolutions
political
revolutions
and
religious
revolutions
scientific
revolutions
scientific
revolutions
are
by
far
the
most
important
although
they
attract
but
little
attention
they
are
often
fraught
with
remote
consequences
such
as
are
not
engendered
by
political
revolutions
we
will
therefore
put
them
first
although
we
can
not
study
them
here
for
instance
if
our
conceptions
of
the
universe
have
profoundly
changed
since
the
time
of
the
revolution
it
is
because
astronomical
discoveries
and
the
application
of
experimental
methods
have
revolutionised
them
by
demonstrating
that
phenomena
instead
of
being
conditioned
by
the
caprices
of
the
gods
are
ruled
by
invariable
laws
such
revolutions
are
fittingly
spoken
of
as
evolution
on
account
of
their
slowness
but
there
are
others
which
although
of
the
same
order
deserve
the
name
of
revolution
by
reason
of
their
rapidity
we
may
instance
the
theories
of
darwin
overthrowing
the
whole
science
of
biology
in
a
few
years
the
discoveries
of
pasteur
which
revolutionised
medicine
during
the
lifetime
of
their
author
and
the
theory
of
the
dissociation
of
matter
proving
that
the
atom
formerly
supposed
to
be
eternal
is
not
immune
from
the
laws
which
condemn
all
the
elements
of
the
universe
to
decline
and
perish
these
scientific
revolutions
in
the
domain
of
ideas
are
purely
intellectual
our
sentiments
and
beliefs
do
not
affect
them
men
submit
to
them
without
discussing
them
their
results
being
controllable
by
experience
they
escape
all
criticism
political
revolutions
beneath
and
very
remote
from
these
scientific
revolutions
which
generate
the
progress
of
civilisations
are
the
religious
and
political
revolutions
which
have
no
kinship
with
them
while
scientific
revolutions
derive
solely
from
rational
elements
political
and
religious
beliefs
are
sustained
almost
exclusively
by
affective
and
mystic
factors
reason
plays
only
a
feeble
part
in
their
genesis
i
insisted
at
some
length
in
my
book
opinions
and
beliefs
on
the
affective
and
mystic
origin
of
beliefs
showing
that
a
political
or
religious
belief
constitutes
an
act
of
faith
elaborated
in
unconsciousness
over
which
in
spite
of
all
appearances
reason
has
no
hold
i
also
showed
that
belief
often
reaches
such
a
degree
of
intensity
that
nothing
can
be
opposed
to
it
the
man
hypnotised
by
his
faith
becomes
an
apostle
ready
to
sacrifice
his
interests
his
happiness
and
even
his
life
for
the
triumph
of
his
faith
the
absurdity
of
his
belief
matters
little
for
him
it
is
a
burning
reality
certitudes
of
mystic
origin
possess
the
marvellous
power
of
entire
domination
over
thought
and
can
only
be
affected
by
time
by
the
very
fact
that
it
is
regarded
as
an
absolute
truth
a
belief
necessarily
becomes
intolerant
this
explains
the
violence
hatred
and
persecution
which
were
the
habitual
accompaniments
of
the
great
political
and
religious
revolutions
notably
of
the
reformation
and
the
french
revolution
certain
periods
of
french
history
remain
incomprehensible
if
we
forget
the
affective
and
mystic
origin
of
beliefs
their
necessary
intolerance
the
impossibility
of
reconciling
them
when
they
come
into
mutual
contact
and
finally
the
power
conferred
by
mystic
beliefs
upon
the
sentiments
which
place
themselves
at
their
service
the
foregoing
conceptions
are
too
novel
as
yet
to
have
modified
the
mentality
of
the
historians
they
will
continue
to
attempt
to
explain
by
means
of
rational
logic
a
host
of
phenomena
which
are
foreign
to
it
events
such
as
the
reformation
which
overwhelmed
france
for
a
period
of
fifty
years
were
in
no
wise
determined
by
rational
influences
yet
rational
influences
are
always
invoked
in
explanation
even
in
the
most
recent
works
thus
in
the
general
history
of
lavisse
and
rambaud
we
read
the
following
explanation
of
the
reformation
it
was
a
spontaneous
movement
born
here
and
there
amidst
the
people
from
the
reading
of
the
gospels
and
the
free
individual
reflections
which
were
suggested
to
simple
persons
by
an
extremely
pious
conscience
and
a
very
bold
reasoning
power
contrary
to
the
assertion
of
these
historians
we
may
say
with
certainty
in
the
first
place
that
such
movements
are
never
spontaneous
and
secondly
that
reason
takes
no
part
in
their
elaboration
the
force
of
the
political
and
religious
beliefs
which
have
moved
the
world
resides
precisely
in
the
fact
that
being
born
of
affective
and
mystic
elements
they
are
neither
created
nor
directed
by
reason
political
or
religious
beliefs
have
a
common
origin
and
obey
the
same
laws
they
are
formed
not
with
the
aid
of
reason
but
more
often
contrary
to
all
reason
buddhism
islamism
the
reformation
jacobinism
socialism
seem
very
different
forms
of
thought
yet
they
have
identical
affective
and
mystic
bases
and
obey
a
logic
that
has
no
affinity
with
rational
logic
political
revolutions
may
result
from
beliefs
established
in
the
minds
of
men
but
many
other
causes
produce
them
the
word
discontent
sums
them
up
as
soon
as
discontent
is
generalised
a
party
is
formed
which
often
becomes
strong
enough
to
struggle
against
the
government
discontent
must
generally
have
been
accumulating
for
a
long
time
in
order
to
produce
its
effects
for
this
reason
a
revolution
does
not
always
represent
a
phenomenon
in
process
of
termination
followed
by
another
which
is
commencing
but
rather
a
continuous
phenomenon
having
somewhat
accelerated
its
evolution
all
the
modern
revolutions
however
have
been
abrupt
movements
entailing
the
instantaneous
overthrow
of
governments
such
for
example
were
the
brazilian
portuguese
turkish
and
chinese
revolutions
to
the
contrary
of
what
might
be
supposed
the
very
conservative
peoples
are
addicted
to
the
most
violent
revolutions
being
conservative
they
are
not
able
to
evolve
slowly
or
to
adapt
themselves
to
variations
of
environment
so
that
when
the
discrepancy
becomes
too
extreme
they
are
bound
to
adapt
themselves
suddenly
this
sudden
evolution
constitutes
a
revolution
peoples
able
to
adapt
themselves
progressively
do
not
always
escape
revolution
it
was
only
by
means
of
a
revolution
that
the
english
in
were
able
to
terminate
the
struggle
which
had
dragged
on
for
a
century
between
the
monarchy
which
sought
to
make
itself
absolute
and
the
nation
which
claimed
the
right
to
govern
itself
through
the
medium
of
its
representatives
the
great
revolutions
have
usually
commenced
from
the
top
not
from
the
bottom
but
once
the
people
is
unchained
it
is
to
the
people
that
revolution
owes
its
might
it
is
obvious
that
revolutions
have
never
taken
place
and
will
never
take
place
save
with
the
aid
of
an
important
fraction
of
the
army
royalty
did
not
disappear
in
france
on
the
day
when
louis
xvi
was
guillotined
but
at
the
precise
moment
when
his
mutinous
troops
refused
to
defend
him
it
is
more
particularly
by
mental
contagion
that
armies
become
disaffected
being
indifferent
enough
at
heart
to
the
established
order
of
things
as
soon
as
the
coalition
of
a
few
officers
had
succeeded
in
overthrowing
the
turkish
government
the
greek
officers
thought
to
imitate
them
and
to
change
their
government
although
there
was
no
analogy
between
the
two
regimes
a
military
movement
may
overthrow
a
government
and
in
the
spanish
republics
the
government
is
hardly
ever
destroyed
by
any
other
means
but
if
the
revolution
is
to
be
productive
of
great
results
it
must
always
be
based
upon
general
discontent
and
general
hopes
unless
it
is
universal
and
excessive
discontent
alone
is
not
sufficient
to
bring
about
a
revolution
it
is
easy
to
lead
a
handful
of
men
to
pillage
destroy
and
massacre
but
to
raise
a
whole
people
or
any
great
portion
of
that
people
calls
for
the
continuous
or
repeated
action
of
leaders
these
exaggerate
the
discontent
they
persuade
the
discontented
that
the
government
is
the
sole
cause
of
all
the
trouble
especially
of
the
prevailing
dearth
and
assure
men
that
the
new
system
proposed
by
them
will
engender
an
age
of
felicity
these
ideas
germinate
propagating
themselves
by
suggestion
and
contagion
and
the
moment
arrives
when
the
revolution
is
ripe
in
this
fashion
the
christian
revolution
and
the
french
revolution
were
prepared
that
the
latter
was
effected
in
a
few
years
while
the
first
required
many
was
due
to
the
fact
that
the
french
revolution
promptly
had
an
armed
force
at
its
disposal
while
christianity
was
long
in
winning
material
power
in
the
beginning
its
only
adepts
were
the
lowly
the
poor
and
the
slaves
filled
with
enthusiasm
by
the
prospect
of
seeing
their
miserable
life
transformed
into
an
eternity
of
delight
by
a
phenomenon
of
contagion
from
below
of
which
history
affords
us
more
than
one
example
the
doctrine
finally
invaded
the
upper
strata
of
the
nation
but
it
was
a
long
time
before
an
emperor
considered
the
new
faith
sufficiently
widespread
to
be
adopted
as
the
official
religion
the
results
of
political
revolutions
when
a
political
party
is
triumphant
it
naturally
seeks
to
organise
society
in
accordance
with
its
interests
the
organisation
will
differ
accordingly
as
the
revolution
has
been
effected
by
the
soldiers
the
radicals
or
the
conservatives
the
new
laws
and
institutions
will
depend
on
the
interests
of
the
triumphant
party
and
of
the
classes
which
have
assisted
it
the
clergy
for
instance
if
the
revolution
has
triumphed
only
after
a
violent
struggle
as
was
the
case
with
the
french
revolution
the
victors
will
reject
at
one
sweep
the
whole
arsenal
of
the
old
law
the
supporters
of
the
fallen
regime
will
be
persecuted
exiled
or
exterminated
the
maximum
of
violence
in
these
persecutions
is
attained
when
the
triumphant
party
is
defending
a
belief
in
addition
to
its
material
interests
then
the
conquered
need
hope
for
no
pity
thus
may
be
explained
the
expulsion
of
the
moors
from
spain
the
autodafes
of
the
inquisition
the
executions
of
the
convention
and
the
recent
laws
against
the
religious
congregations
in
france
the
absolute
power
which
is
assumed
by
the
victors
leads
them
sometimes
to
extreme
measures
such
as
the
convention
decree
that
gold
was
to
be
replaced
by
paper
that
goods
were
to
be
sold
at
determined
prices
very
soon
it
runs
up
against
a
wall
of
unavoidable
necessities
which
turn
opinion
against
its
tyranny
and
finally
leave
it
defenceless
before
attack
as
befell
at
the
end
of
the
french
revolution
the
same
thing
happened
recently
to
a
socialist
australian
ministry
composed
almost
exclusively
of
it
enacted
laws
so
absurd
and
accorded
such
privileges
to
the
trade
unions
that
public
opinion
rebelled
against
it
so
unanimously
that
in
three
months
it
was
overthrown
but
the
cases
we
have
considered
are
exceptional
the
majority
of
revolutions
have
been
accomplished
in
order
to
place
a
new
sovereign
in
power
now
this
sovereign
knows
very
well
that
the
first
condition
of
maintaining
his
power
consists
in
not
too
exclusively
favouring
a
single
class
but
in
seeking
to
conciliate
all
to
do
this
he
will
establish
a
sort
of
equilibrium
between
them
so
as
not
to
be
dominated
by
any
one
of
these
classes
to
allow
one
class
to
become
predominant
is
to
condemn
himself
presently
to
accept
that
class
as
his
master
this
law
is
one
of
the
most
certain
of
political
psychology
the
kings
of
france
understood
it
very
well
when
they
struggled
so
energetically
against
the
encroachments
first
of
the
nobility
and
then
of
the
clergy
if
they
had
not
done
so
their
fate
would
have
been
that
of
the
german
emperors
of
the
middle
ages
who
excommunicated
by
the
pope
were
reduced
like
henry
iv
at
canossa
to
make
a
pilgrimage
and
humbly
to
sue
for
the
forgiveness
this
same
law
has
continually
been
verified
during
the
course
of
history
when
at
the
end
of
the
roman
empire
the
military
caste
became
preponderant
the
emperors
depended
entirely
upon
their
soldiers
who
appointed
and
deposed
them
at
will
it
was
therefore
a
great
advantage
for
france
that
she
was
so
long
governed
by
a
monarch
almost
absolute
supposed
to
hold
his
power
by
divine
right
and
surrounded
therefore
by
a
considerable
prestige
without
such
an
authority
he
could
have
controlled
neither
the
feudal
nobility
nor
the
clergy
nor
the
parliaments
if
poland
towards
the
end
of
the
sixteenth
century
had
also
possessed
an
absolute
and
respected
monarchy
she
would
not
have
descended
the
path
of
decadence
which
led
to
her
disappearance
from
the
map
of
europe
we
have
shewn
in
this
chapter
that
political
revolutions
may
be
accompanied
by
important
social
transformations
we
shall
soon
see
how
slight
are
these
transformations
compared
to
those
produced
by
religious
revolutions
chapter
ii
religious
revolutions
the
importance
of
the
study
of
religious
revolutions
in
respect
of
the
comprehension
of
the
great
political
revolutions
a
portion
of
this
work
will
be
devoted
to
the
french
revolution
it
was
full
of
acts
of
violence
which
naturally
had
their
psychological
causes
these
exceptional
events
will
always
fill
us
with
astonishment
and
we
even
feel
them
to
be
inexplicable
they
become
comprehensible
however
if
we
consider
that
the
french
revolution
constituting
a
new
religion
was
bound
to
obey
the
laws
which
condition
the
propagation
of
all
beliefs
its
fury
and
its
hecatombs
will
then
become
intelligible
in
studying
the
history
of
a
great
religious
revolution
that
of
the
reformation
we
shall
see
that
a
number
of
psychological
elements
which
figured
therein
were
equally
active
during
the
french
revolution
in
both
we
observe
the
insignificant
bearing
of
the
rational
value
of
a
belief
upon
its
propagation
the
inefficacy
of
persecution
the
impossibility
of
tolerance
between
contrary
beliefs
and
the
violence
and
the
desperate
struggles
resulting
from
the
conflict
of
different
faiths
we
also
observe
the
exploitation
of
a
belief
by
interests
quite
independent
of
that
belief
finally
we
see
that
it
is
impossible
to
modify
the
convictions
of
men
without
also
modifying
their
existence
these
phenomena
verified
we
shall
see
plainly
why
the
gospel
of
the
revolution
was
propagated
by
the
same
methods
as
all
the
religious
gospels
notably
that
of
calvin
it
could
not
have
been
propagated
otherwise
but
although
there
are
close
analogies
between
the
genesis
of
a
religious
revolution
such
as
the
reformation
and
that
of
a
great
political
revolution
like
our
own
their
remote
consequences
are
very
different
which
explains
the
difference
of
duration
which
they
display
in
religious
revolutions
no
experience
can
reveal
to
the
faithful
that
they
are
deceived
since
they
would
have
to
go
to
heaven
to
make
the
discovery
in
political
revolutions
experience
quickly
demonstrates
the
error
of
a
false
doctrine
and
forces
men
to
abandon
it
thus
at
the
end
of
the
directory
the
application
of
jacobin
beliefs
had
led
france
to
such
a
degree
of
ruin
poverty
and
despair
that
the
wildest
jacobins
themselves
had
to
renounce
their
system
nothing
survived
of
their
theories
except
a
few
principles
which
can
not
be
verified
by
experience
such
as
the
universal
happiness
which
equality
should
bestow
upon
humanity
the
beginnings
of
the
reformation
and
its
first
disciples
the
reformation
was
finally
to
exercise
a
profound
influence
upon
the
sentiments
and
moral
ideas
of
a
great
proportion
of
mankind
modest
in
its
beginnings
it
was
at
first
a
simple
struggle
against
the
abuses
of
the
clergy
and
from
a
practical
point
of
view
a
return
to
the
prescriptions
of
the
gospel
it
never
constituted
as
has
been
claimed
an
aspiration
towards
freedom
of
thought
calvin
was
as
intolerant
as
robespierre
and
all
the
theorists
of
the
age
considered
that
the
religion
of
subjects
must
be
that
of
the
prince
who
governed
them
indeed
in
every
country
where
the
reformation
was
established
the
sovereign
replaced
the
pope
of
rome
with
the
same
rights
and
the
same
powers
in
france
in
default
of
publicity
and
means
of
communication
the
new
faith
spread
slowly
enough
at
first
it
was
about
that
luther
recruited
a
few
adepts
and
only
towards
was
the
new
belief
sufficiently
widespread
for
men
to
consider
it
necessary
to
burn
its
disciples
in
conformity
with
a
psychological
law
these
executions
merely
favoured
the
propagation
of
the
reformation
its
first
followers
included
priests
and
magistrates
but
were
principally
obscure
artisans
their
conversion
was
effected
almost
exclusively
by
mental
contagion
and
suggestion
as
soon
as
a
new
belief
extends
itself
we
see
grouped
round
it
many
persons
who
are
indifferent
to
the
belief
but
who
find
in
it
a
pretext
or
opportunity
for
gratifying
their
passions
or
their
greed
this
phenomenon
was
observed
at
the
time
of
the
reformation
in
many
countries
notably
in
germany
and
in
england
luther
having
taught
that
the
clergy
had
no
need
of
wealth
the
german
lords
found
many
merits
in
a
faith
which
enabled
them
to
seize
upon
the
goods
of
the
church
henry
viii
enriched
himself
by
a
similar
operation
sovereigns
who
were
often
molested
by
the
pope
could
as
a
rule
only
look
favourably
upon
a
doctrine
which
added
religious
powers
to
their
political
powers
and
made
each
of
them
a
pope
far
from
diminishing
the
absolutism
of
rulers
the
reformation
only
exaggerated
it
rational
value
of
the
doctrines
of
the
reformation
the
reformation
overturned
all
europe
and
came
near
to
ruining
france
of
which
it
made
a
for
a
period
of
fifty
years
never
did
a
cause
so
insignificant
from
the
rational
point
of
view
produce
such
great
results
here
is
one
of
the
innumerable
proofs
of
the
fact
that
beliefs
are
propagated
independently
of
all
reason
the
theological
doctrines
which
aroused
men
passions
so
violently
and
notably
those
of
calvin
are
not
even
worthy
of
examination
in
the
light
of
rational
logic
greatly
concerned
about
his
salvation
having
an
excessive
fear
of
the
devil
which
his
confessor
was
unable
to
allay
luther
sought
the
surest
means
of
pleasing
god
that
he
might
avoid
hell
having
commenced
by
denying
the
pope
the
right
to
sell
indulgences
he
presently
entirely
denied
his
authority
and
that
of
the
church
condemned
religious
ceremonies
confession
and
the
worship
of
the
saints
and
declared
that
christians
should
have
no
rules
of
conduct
other
than
the
bible
he
also
considered
that
no
one
could
be
saved
without
the
grace
of
god
this
last
theory
known
as
that
of
predestination
was
in
luther
rather
uncertain
but
was
stated
precisely
by
calvin
who
made
it
the
very
foundation
of
a
doctrine
to
which
the
majority
of
protestants
are
still
subservient
according
to
him
from
all
eternity
god
has
predestined
certain
men
to
be
burned
and
others
to
be
saved
why
this
monstrous
iniquity
simply
because
it
is
the
will
of
god
thus
according
to
calvin
who
for
that
matter
merely
developed
certain
assertions
of
augustine
an
god
would
amuse
himself
by
creating
living
beings
simply
in
order
to
burn
them
during
all
eternity
without
paying
any
heed
to
their
acts
or
merits
it
is
marvellous
that
such
revolting
insanity
could
for
such
a
length
of
time
subjugate
so
many
minds
marvellous
that
it
does
so
still
the
doctrine
of
predestination
is
still
taught
in
protestant
catechisms
as
is
proved
by
the
following
passage
extracted
from
the
last
edition
of
an
official
catechism
for
which
i
sent
to
edinburgh
by
the
decree
of
god
for
the
manifestation
of
his
glory
some
men
and
angels
are
predestinated
unto
everlasting
life
and
others
foreordained
to
everlasting
death
these
angels
and
men
thus
predestinated
and
foreordained
are
particularly
and
unchangeably
designed
and
their
number
is
so
certain
and
definite
that
it
can
not
be
either
increased
or
diminished
those
of
mankind
that
are
predestinated
unto
life
god
before
the
foundation
of
the
world
was
laid
according
to
his
eternal
and
immutable
purpose
and
the
secret
counsel
and
good
pleasure
of
his
will
hath
chosen
in
christ
unto
everlasting
glory
out
of
his
mere
free
grace
and
love
without
any
foresight
of
faith
or
good
works
or
perseverance
in
either
of
them
or
any
other
thing
in
the
creature
as
conditions
or
causes
moving
him
thereunto
and
all
to
the
praise
of
his
glorious
grace
as
god
hath
appointed
the
elect
unto
glory
so
hath
he
by
the
eternal
and
most
free
purpose
of
his
will
foreordained
all
the
means
thereunto
wherefore
they
who
are
elected
being
fallen
in
adam
are
redeemed
by
christ
are
effectually
called
unto
faith
in
christ
by
his
spirit
working
in
due
season
are
justified
adopted
sanctified
and
kept
by
his
power
through
faith
unto
salvation
neither
are
any
other
redeemed
by
christ
effectually
called
justified
adopted
sanctified
and
saved
but
the
elect
only
the
psychology
of
calvin
is
not
without
affinity
with
that
of
robespierre
like
the
latter
the
master
of
the
pure
truth
he
sent
to
death
those
who
would
not
accept
his
doctrines
god
he
stated
wishes
that
one
should
put
aside
all
humanity
when
it
is
a
question
of
striving
for
his
glory
the
case
of
calvin
and
his
disciples
shows
that
matters
which
rationally
are
the
most
contradictory
become
perfectly
reconciled
in
minds
which
are
hypnotised
by
a
belief
in
the
eyes
of
rational
logic
it
seems
impossible
to
base
a
morality
upon
the
theory
of
predestination
since
whatever
they
do
men
are
sure
of
being
either
saved
or
damned
however
calvin
had
no
difficulty
in
erecting
a
most
severe
morality
upon
this
totally
illogical
basis
considering
themselves
the
elect
of
god
his
disciples
were
so
swollen
by
pride
and
the
sense
of
their
own
dignity
that
they
felt
obliged
to
serve
as
models
in
their
conduct
propagation
of
the
reformation
the
new
faith
was
propagated
not
by
speech
still
less
by
process
of
reasoning
but
by
the
mechanism
described
in
our
preceding
work
that
is
by
the
influence
of
affirmation
repetition
mental
contagion
and
prestige
at
a
much
later
date
revolutionary
ideas
were
spread
over
france
in
the
same
fashion
persecution
as
we
have
already
remarked
only
favoured
this
propagation
each
execution
led
to
fresh
conversions
as
was
seen
in
the
early
years
of
the
christian
church
anne
dubourg
parliamentary
councillor
condemned
to
be
burned
alive
marched
to
the
stake
exhorting
the
crowd
to
be
converted
his
constancy
says
a
witness
made
more
protestants
among
the
young
men
of
the
colleges
than
the
books
of
calvin
to
prevent
the
condemned
from
speaking
to
the
people
their
tongues
were
cut
out
before
they
were
burned
the
horror
of
their
sufferings
was
increased
by
attaching
the
victims
to
an
iron
chain
which
enabled
the
executioners
to
plunge
them
into
the
fire
and
withdraw
them
several
times
in
succession
but
nothing
induced
the
protestants
to
retract
even
the
offer
of
an
amnesty
after
they
had
felt
the
fire
in
francis
forsaking
his
previous
tolerance
ordered
six
fires
to
be
lighted
simultaneously
in
paris
the
convention
as
we
know
limited
itself
to
a
single
guillotine
in
the
same
city
it
is
probable
that
the
sufferings
of
the
victims
were
not
very
excruciating
the
insensibility
of
the
christian
martyrs
had
already
been
remarked
believers
are
hypnotised
by
their
faith
and
we
know
that
certain
forms
of
hypnotism
engender
complete
insensibility
the
new
faith
progressed
rapidly
in
there
were
two
thousand
reformed
churches
in
france
and
many
great
lords
at
first
indifferent
enough
adhered
to
the
new
doctrine
conflict
between
different
religious
beliefs
impossibility
of
tolerance
i
have
already
stated
that
intolerance
is
always
an
accompaniment
of
powerful
religious
beliefs
political
and
religious
revolutions
furnish
us
with
numerous
proofs
of
this
fact
and
show
us
also
that
the
mutual
intolerance
of
sectaries
of
the
same
religion
is
always
much
greater
than
that
of
the
defenders
of
remote
and
alien
faiths
such
as
islamism
and
christianity
in
fact
if
we
consider
the
faiths
for
whose
sake
france
was
so
long
rent
asunder
we
shall
find
that
they
did
not
differ
on
any
but
accessory
points
catholics
and
protestants
adored
exactly
the
same
god
and
only
differed
in
their
manner
of
adoring
him
if
reason
had
played
the
smallest
part
in
the
elaboration
of
their
belief
it
could
easily
have
proved
to
them
that
it
must
be
quite
indifferent
to
god
whether
he
sees
men
adore
him
in
this
fashion
or
in
that
reason
being
powerless
to
affect
the
brain
of
the
convinced
protestants
and
catholics
continued
their
ferocious
conflicts
all
the
efforts
of
their
sovereigns
to
reconcile
them
were
in
vain
catherine
de
medicis
seeing
the
party
of
the
reformed
church
increasing
day
by
day
in
spite
of
persecution
and
attracting
a
considerable
number
of
nobles
and
magistrates
thought
to
disarm
them
by
convoking
at
poissy
in
an
assembly
of
bishops
and
pastors
with
the
object
of
fusing
the
two
doctrines
such
an
enterprise
indicated
that
the
queen
despite
her
subtlety
knew
nothing
of
the
laws
of
mystic
logic
not
in
all
history
can
one
cite
an
example
of
a
belief
destroyed
or
reduced
by
means
of
refutation
catherine
did
not
even
know
that
although
toleration
is
with
difficulty
possible
between
individuals
it
is
impossible
between
collectivities
her
attempt
failed
completely
the
assembled
theologians
hurled
texts
and
insults
at
one
another
heads
but
no
one
was
moved
catherine
thought
to
succeed
better
in
by
promulgating
an
edict
according
protestants
the
right
to
unite
in
the
public
celebration
of
their
cult
this
tolerance
very
admirable
from
a
philosophical
point
of
view
but
not
at
all
wise
from
the
political
standpoint
had
no
other
result
beyond
exasperating
both
parties
in
the
midi
where
the
protestants
were
strongest
they
persecuted
the
catholics
sought
to
convert
them
by
violence
cut
their
throats
if
they
did
not
succeed
and
sacked
their
cathedrals
in
the
regions
where
the
catholics
were
more
numerous
the
reformers
suffered
like
persecutions
such
hostilities
as
these
inevitably
engendered
civil
war
thus
arose
the
religious
wars
which
so
long
spilled
the
blood
of
france
the
cities
were
ravaged
the
inhabitants
massacred
and
the
struggle
rapidly
assumed
that
special
quality
of
ferocity
peculiar
to
religious
or
political
conflicts
which
at
a
later
date
was
to
reappear
in
the
wars
of
la
vendee
old
men
women
and
children
all
were
exterminated

certain

president
of
the
parliament
of
aix
had
already
set
an
example
by
killing
persons
in
the
space
of
ten
days
with
refinements
of
cruelty
and
destroying
three
cities
and
villages
montluc
a
worthy
forerunner
of
carrier
had
the
calvinists
thrown
living
into
the
wells
until
these
were
full
the
protestants
were
no
more
humane
they
did
not
spare
even
the
catholic
churches
and
treated
the
tombs
and
statues
just
as
the
delegates
of
the
convention
were
to
treat
the
royal
tombs
of
saint
denis
under
the
influence
of
these
conflicts
france
was
progressively
disintegrated
and
at
the
end
of
the
reign
of
henri
iii
was
parcelled
out
into
veritable
little
confederated
municipal
republics
forming
so
many
sovereign
states
the
royal
power
was
vanishing
the
states
of
blois
claimed
to
dictate
their
wishes
to
henri
who
had
fled
from
his
capital
in
the
traveller
lippomano
who
traversed
france
saw
important
cities
orleans
tours
blois
poitiers
entirely
devastated
the
cathedrals
and
churches
in
ruins
and
the
tombs
shattered
this
was
almost
the
state
of
france
at
the
end
of
the
directory
among
the
events
of
this
epoch
that
which
has
left
the
darkest
memory
although
it
was
not
perhaps
the
most
murderous
was
the
massacre
of
bartholomew
in
ordered
according
to
the
historians
by
catherine
de
medicis
and
charles
ix
one
does
not
require
a
very
profound
knowledge
of
psychology
to
realise
that
no
sovereign
could
have
ordered
such
an
event
bartholomew
day
was
not
a
royal
but
a
popular
crime
catherine
de
medicis
believing
her
existence
and
that
of
the
king
threatened
by
a
plot
directed
by
four
or
five
protestant
leaders
then
in
paris
sent
men
to
kill
them
in
their
houses
according
to
the
summary
fashion
of
the
time
the
massacre
which
followed
is
very
well
explained
by
battifol
in
the
following
terms
at
the
report
of
what
was
afoot
the
rumour
immediately
ran
through
paris
that
the
huguenots
were
being
massacred
catholic
gentlemen
soldiers
of
the
guard
archers
men
of
the
people
in
short
all
paris
rushed
into
the
streets
arms
in
hand
in
order
to
participate
in
the
execution
and
the
general
massacre
commenced
to
the
sound
of
ferocious
cries
of
huguenots
kill
kill
they
were
struck
down
they
were
drowned
they
were
hanged
all
that
were
known
as
heretics
were
so
served
two
thousand
persons
were
killed
in
paris
by
contagion
the
people
of
the
provinces
imitated
those
of
paris
and
six
to
eight
thousand
protestants
were
slain
when
time
had
somewhat
cooled
religious
passions
all
the
historians
even
the
catholics
spoke
of
bartholomew
day
with
indignation
they
thus
showed
how
difficult
it
is
for
the
mentality
of
one
epoch
to
understand
that
of
another
far
from
being
criticised
bartholomew
day
provoked
an
indescribable
enthusiasm
throughout
the
whole
of
catholic
europe
philip
ii
was
delirious
with
joy
when
he
heard
the
news
and
the
king
of
france
received
more
congratulations
than
if
he
had
won
a
great
battle
but
it
was
pope
gregory
xiii
above
all
who
manifested
the
keenest
satisfaction
he
had
a
medal
struck
to
commemorate
the
happy
event
ordered
to
be
lit
and
cannon
fired
celebrated
several
masses
and
sent
for
the
painter
vasari
to
depict
on
the
walls
of
the
vatican
the
principal
scenes
of
carnage
further
he
sent
to
the
king
of
france
an
ambassador
instructed
to
felicitate
that
monarch
upon
his
fine
action
it
is
historical
details
of
this
kind
that
enable
us
to
comprehend
the
mind
of
the
believer
the
jacobins
of
the
terror
had
a
mentality
very
like
that
of
gregory
xiii
the
medal
must
have
been
distributed
pretty
widely
for
the
cabinet
of
medals
at
the
bibliotheque
nationale
possesses
three
examples
one
in
gold
one
in
silver
and
one
in
copper
this
medal
reproduced
by
bonnani
in
his
numism
pontific
vol
represents
on
one
side
gregory
and
on
the
other
an
angel
striking
huguenots
with
a
sword
the
exergue
is
ugonotorum
strages
that
is
massacre
of
the
huguenots
the
word
strages
may
be
translated
by
carnage
or
massacre
a
sense
which
it
possesses
in
cicero
and
livy
or
again
by
disaster
ruin
a
sense
attributed
to
it
in
virgil
and
tacitus
naturally
the
protestants
were
not
indifferent
to
such
a
hecatomb
and
they
made
such
progress
that
in
henri
iii
was
reduced
to
granting
them
by
the
edict
of
beaulieu
entire
liberty
of
worship
eight
strong
places
and
in
the
parliaments
chambers
composed
half
of
catholics
and
half
of
huguenots
these
forced
concessions
did
not
lead
to
peace
a
catholic
league
was
created
having
the
duke
of
guise
at
its
head
and
the
conflict
continued
but
it
could
not
last
for
ever
we
know
how
henri
iv
put
an
end
to
it
at
least
for
a
time
by
his
abjuration
in
and
by
the
edict
of
nantes
the
struggle
was
quieted
but
not
terminated
under
louis
xiii
the
protestants
were
still
restless
and
in
richelieu
was
obliged
to
besiege
la
rochelle
where
protestants
perished
afterwards
possessing
more
political
than
religious
feeling
the
famous
cardinal
proved
extremely
tolerant
toward
the
reformers
this
tolerance
could
not
last
contrary
beliefs
can
not
come
into
contact
without
seeking
to
annihilate
each
other
as
soon
as
one
feels
capable
of
dominating
the
other
under
louis
xiv
the
protestants
had
become
by
far
the
weaker
and
were
forced
to
renounce
the
struggle
and
live
at
peace
their
number
was
then
about
and
they
possessed
more
than
churches
served
by
about
pastors
the
presence
of
these
heretics
on
french
soil
was
intolerable
to
the
catholic
clergy
who
endeavoured
to
persecute
them
in
various
ways
as
these
persecutions
had
little
result
louis
xiv
resorted
to
dragonnading
them
in
when
many
individuals
perished
but
without
further
result
under
the
pressure
of
the
clergy
notably
of
bossuett
the
edict
of
nantes
was
revoked
and
the
protestants
were
forced
to
accept
conversion
or
to
leave
france
this
disastrous
emigration
lasted
a
long
time
and
is
said
to
have
cost
france
inhabitants
men
of
notable
energy
since
they
had
the
courage
to
listen
to
their
conscience
rather
than
their
interests
the
results
of
religious
revolutions
if
religious
revolutions
were
judged
only
by
the
gloomy
story
of
the
reformation
we
should
be
forced
to
regard
them
as
highly
disastrous
but
all
have
not
played
a
like
part
the
civilising
influence
of
certain
among
them
being
considerable
by
giving
a
people
moral
unity
they
greatly
increase
its
material
power
we
see
this
notably
when
a
new
faith
brought
by
mohammed
transforms
the
petty
and
impotent
tribes
of
arabia
into
a
formidable
nation
such
a
new
religious
belief
does
not
merely
render
a
people
homogeneous
it
attains
a
result
that
no
philosophy
no
code
ever
attained
it
sensibly
transforms
what
is
almost
unchangeable
the
sentiments
of
a
race
we
see
this
at
the
period
when
the
most
powerful
religious
revolution
recorded
by
history
overthrew
paganism
to
substitute
a
god
who
came
from
the
plains
of
galilee
the
new
ideal
demanded
the
renunciation
of
all
the
joys
of
existence
in
order
to
acquire
the
eternal
happiness
of
heaven
no
doubt
such
an
ideal
was
readily
accepted
by
the
poor
the
enslaved
the
disinherited
who
were
deprived
of
all
the
joys
of
life
here
below
to
whom
an
enchanting
future
was
offered
in
exchange
for
a
life
without
hope
but
the
austere
existence
so
easily
embraced
by
the
poor
was
also
embraced
by
the
rich
in
this
above
all
was
the
power
of
the
new
faith
manifested
not
only
did
the
christian
revolution
transform
manners
it
also
exercised
for
a
space
of
two
thousand
years
a
preponderating
influence
over
civilisation
directly
a
religious
faith
triumphs
all
the
elements
of
civilisation
naturally
adapt
themselves
to
it
so
that
civilisation
is
rapidly
transformed
writers
artists
and
philosophers
merely
symbolise
in
their
works
the
ideas
of
the
new
faith
when
any
religious
or
political
faith
whatsoever
has
triumphed
not
only
is
reason
powerless
to
affect
it
but
it
even
finds
motives
which
impel
it
to
interpret
and
so
justify
the
faith
in
question
and
to
strive
to
impose
it
upon
others
there
were
probably
as
many
theologians
and
orators
in
the
time
of
moloch
to
prove
the
utility
of
human
sacrifices
as
there
were
at
other
periods
to
glorify
the
inquisition
the
massacre
of
bartholomew
and
the
hecatombs
of
the
terror
we
must
not
hope
to
see
peoples
possessed
by
strong
beliefs
readily
achieve
tolerance
the
only
people
who
attained
to
toleration
in
the
ancient
world
were
the
polytheists
the
nations
which
practise
toleration
at
the
present
time
are
those
that
might
well
be
termed
polytheistical
since
as
in
england
and
america
they
are
divided
into
innumerable
sects
under
identical
names
they
really
adore
very
different
deities
the
multiplicity
of
beliefs
which
results
in
such
toleration
finally
results
also
in
weakness
we
therefore
come
to
a
psychological
problem
not
hitherto
resolved
how
to
possess
a
faith
at
once
powerful
and
tolerant
the
foregoing
brief
explanation
reveals
the
large
part
played
by
religious
revolutions
and
the
power
of
beliefs
despite
their
slight
rational
value
they
shape
history
and
prevent
the
peoples
from
remaining
a
mass
of
individuals
without
cohesion
or
strength
man
has
needed
them
at
all
times
to
orientate
his
thought
and
guide
his
conduct
no
philosophy
has
as
yet
succeeded
in
replacing
them
chapter
iii
the
action
of
governments
in
revolutions
the
feeble
resistance
of
governments
in
time
of
revolution
many
modern
nations
france
spain
italy
austria
poland
japan
turkey
portugal
have
known
revolutions
within
the
last
century
these
were
usually
characterised
by
their
instantaneous
quality
and
the
facility
with
which
the
governments
attacked
were
overthrown
the
instantaneous
nature
of
these
revolutions
is
explained
by
the
rapidity
of
mental
contagion
due
to
modern
methods
of
publicity
the
slight
resistance
of
the
governments
attacked
is
more
surprising
it
implies
a
total
inability
to
comprehend
and
foresee
created
by
a
blind
confidence
in
their
own
strength
the
facility
with
which
governments
fall
is
not
however
a
new
phenomenon
it
has
been
proved
more
than
once
not
only
in
autocratic
systems
which
are
always
overturned
by
palace
conspiracies
but
also
in
governments
perfectly
instructed
in
the
state
of
public
opinion
by
the
press
and
their
own
agents
among
these
instantaneous
downfalls
one
of
the
most
striking
was
that
which
followed
the
ordinances
of
charles
x
this
monarch
was
as
we
know
overthrown
in
four
days
his
minister
polignac
had
taken
no
measures
of
defence
and
the
king
was
so
confident
of
the
tranquillity
of
paris
that
he
had
gone
hunting
the
army
was
not
in
the
least
hostile
as
in
the
reign
of
louis
but
the
troops
badly
officered
disbanded
before
the
attacks
of
a
few
insurgents
the
overthrow
of
was
still
more
typical
since
it
did
not
result
from
any
arbitrary
action
on
the
part
of
the
sovereign
this
monarch
was
not
surrounded
by
the
hatred
which
finally
surrounded
charles
and
his
fall
was
the
result
of
an
insignificant
riot
which
could
easily
have
been
repressed
historians
who
can
hardly
comprehend
how
a
solidly
constituted
government
supported
by
an
imposing
army
can
be
overthrown
by
a
few
rioters
naturally
attributed
the
fall
of
to
causes
in
reality
the
incapacity
of
the
generals
entrusted
with
his
defence
was
the
real
cause
of
his
fall
this
case
is
one
of
the
most
instructive
that
could
be
cited
and
is
worthy
of
a
moment
consideration
it
has
been
perfectly
investigated
by
general
bonnal
in
the
light
of
the
notes
of
an
general
elchingen
thousand
troops
were
then
in
paris
but
the
weakness
and
incapacity
of
their
officers
made
it
impossible
to
use
them
contradictory
orders
were
given
and
finally
the
troops
were
forbidden
to
fire
on
the
people
who
moreover
and
nothing
could
have
been
more
dangerous
were
permitted
to
mingle
with
the
troops
the
riot
succeeded
without
fighting
and
forced
the
king
to
abdicate
applying
to
the
preceding
case
our
knowledge
of
the
psychology
of
crowds
general
bonnal
shows
how
easily
the
riot
which
overthrew
could
have
been
controlled
he
proves
notably
that
if
the
commanding
officers
had
not
completely
lost
their
heads
quite
a
small
body
of
troops
could
have
prevented
the
insurgents
from
invading
the
chamber
of
deputies
this
last
composed
of
monarchists
would
certainly
have
proclaimed
the
count
of
paris
under
the
regency
of
his
mother
similar
phenomena
were
observable
in
the
revolutions
of
spain
and
portugal
these
facts
show
the
role
of
petty
accessory
circumstances
in
great
events
and
prove
that
one
must
not
speak
too
readily
of
the
general
laws
of
history
without
the
riot
which
overthrew
we
should
probably
have
seen
neither
the
republic
of
nor
the
second
empire
nor
sedan
nor
the
invasion
nor
the
loss
of
alsace
in
the
revolutions
of
which
i
have
just
been
speaking
the
army
was
of
no
assistance
to
the
government
but
did
not
turn
against
it
it
sometimes
happens
otherwise
it
is
often
the
army
which
effects
the
revolution
as
in
turkey
and
portugal
the
innumerable
revolutions
of
the
latin
republics
of
america
are
effected
by
the
army
when
a
revolution
is
effected
by
an
army
the
new
rulers
naturally
fall
under
its
domination
i
have
already
recalled
the
fact
that
this
was
the
case
at
the
end
of
the
roman
empire
when
the
emperors
were
made
and
unmade
by
the
soldiery
the
same
thing
has
sometimes
been
witnessed
in
modern
times
the
following
extract
from
a
newspaper
with
reference
to
the
greek
revolution
shows
what
becomes
of
a
government
dominated
by
its
army
one
day
it
was
announced
that
eighty
officers
of
the
navy
would
send
in
their
resignations
if
the
government
did
not
dismiss
the
leaders
of
whom
they
complained
another
time
it
was
the
agricultural
labourers
on
a
farm
metairie
belonging
to
the
crown
prince
who
demanded
the
partition
of
the
soil
among
them
the
navy
protested
against
the
promotion
promised
to
colonel
zorbas
colonel
zorbas
after
a
week
of
discussion
with
lieutenant
typaldos
treated
with
the
president
of
the
council
as
one
power
with
another
during
this
time
the
federation
of
the
corporations
abused
the
officers
of
the
navy
a
deputy
demanded
that
these
officers
and
their
families
should
be
treated
as
brigands
when
commander
miaoulis
fired
on
the
rebels
the
sailors
who
first
of
all
had
obeyed
typaldos
returned
to
duty
this
is
no
longer
the
harmonious
greece
of
pericles
and
themistocles
it
is
a
hideous
camp
of
agramant
a
revolution
can
not
be
effected
without
the
assistance
or
at
least
the
neutrality
of
the
army
but
it
often
happens
that
the
movement
commences
without
it
this
was
the
case
with
the
revolutions
of
and
and
that
of
which
overthrew
the
empire
after
the
humiliation
of
france
by
the
surrender
of
sedan
the
majority
of
revolutions
take
place
in
the
capitals
and
by
means
of
contagion
spread
through
the
country
but
this
is
not
a
constant
rule
we
know
that
during
the
french
revolution
la
vendee
brittany
and
the
midi
revolted
spontaneously
against
paris
how
the
resistance
of
governments
may
overcome
revolution
in
the
greater
number
of
the
revolutions
enumerated
above
we
have
seen
governments
perish
by
their
weakness
as
soon
as
they
were
touched
they
fell
the
russian
revolution
proved
that
a
government
which
defends
itself
energetically
may
finally
triumph
never
was
revolution
more
menacing
to
the
government
after
the
disasters
suffered
in
the
orient
and
the
severities
of
a
too
oppressive
autocratic
regime
all
classes
of
society
including
a
portion
of
the
army
and
the
fleet
had
revolted
the
railways
posts
and
telegraph
services
had
struck
so
that
communications
between
the
various
portions
of
the
vast
empire
were
interrupted
the
rural
class
itself
forming
the
majority
of
the
nation
began
to
feel
the
influence
of
the
revolutionary
propaganda
the
lot
of
the
peasants
was
wretched
they
were
obliged
by
the
system
of
the
mir
to
cultivate
soil
which
they
could
not
acquire
the
government
resolved
immediately
to
conciliate
this
large
class
of
peasants
by
turning
them
into
proprietors
special
laws
forced
the
landlords
to
sell
the
peasants
a
portion
of
their
lands
and
banks
intended
to
lend
the
buyers
the
necessary
were
created
the
sums
lent
were
to
be
repaid
by
small
annuities
deducted
from
the
product
of
the
sale
of
the
crops
assured
of
the
neutrality
of
the
peasants
the
government
could
contend
with
the
fanatics
who
were
burning
the
towns
throwing
bombs
among
the
crowds
and
waging
a
merciless
warfare
all
those
who
could
be
taken
were
killed
such
extermination
is
the
only
method
discovered
since
the
beginning
of
the
world
by
which
a
society
can
be
protected
against
the
rebels
who
wish
to
destroy
it
the
victorious
government
understood
moreover
the
necessity
of
satisfying
the
legitimate
claims
of
the
enlightened
portion
of
the
nation
it
created
a
parliament
instructed
to
prepare
laws
and
control
expenditure
the
history
of
the
russian
revolution
shows
us
how
a
government
all
of
whose
natural
supports
have
crumbled
in
succession
can
with
wisdom
and
firmness
triumph
over
the
most
formidable
obstacles
it
has
been
very
justly
said
that
governments
are
not
overthrown
but
that
they
commit
suicide
revolutions
effected
by
examples
china
turkey
governments
almost
invariably
fight
revolutions
they
hardly
ever
create
them
representing
the
needs
of
the
moment
and
general
opinion
they
follow
the
reformers
timidly
they
do
not
precede
them
sometimes
however
certain
governments
have
attempted
those
sudden
reforms
which
we
know
as
revolutions
the
stability
or
instability
of
the
national
mind
decrees
the
success
or
failure
of
such
attempts
they
succeed
when
the
people
on
whom
the
government
seeks
to
impose
new
institutions
is
composed
of
tribes
without
fixed
laws
without
solid
traditions
that
is
to
say
without
a
settled
national
mind
such
was
the
condition
of
russia
in
the
days
of
peter
the
great
we
know
how
he
sought
to
europeanise
the
populations
by
means
of
force
japan
is
another
example
of
a
revolution
effected
by
a
government
but
it
was
her
machinery
not
her
mind
that
was
reformed
it
needs
a
very
powerful
autocrat
seconded
by
a
man
of
genius
to
succeed
even
partially
in
such
a
task
more
often
than
not
the
reformer
finds
that
the
whole
people
rises
up
against
him
then
to
the
contrary
of
what
befalls
in
an
ordinary
revolution
the
autocrat
is
revolutionary
and
the
people
is
conservative
but
an
attentive
study
will
soon
show
you
that
the
peoples
are
always
extremely
conservative
failure
is
the
rule
with
these
attempts
whether
effected
by
the
upper
classes
or
the
lower
revolutions
do
not
change
the
souls
of
peoples
that
have
been
a
long
time
established
they
only
change
those
things
that
are
worn
by
time
and
ready
to
fall
china
is
at
the
present
time
making
a
very
interesting
but
impossible
experiment
in
seeking
by
means
of
the
government
suddenly
to
renew
the
institutions
of
the
country
the
revolution
which
overturned
the
dynasty
of
her
ancient
sovereigns
was
the
indirect
consequence
of
the
discontent
provoked
by
reforms
which
the
government
had
sought
to
impose
with
a
view
to
ameliorating
the
condition
of
china
the
suppression
of
opium
and
gaming
the
reform
of
the
army
and
the
creation
of
schools
involved
an
increase
of
taxation
which
as
well
as
the
reforms
themselves
greatly
indisposed
the
general
opinion
a
few
cultured
chinese
educated
in
the
schools
of
europe
profited
by
this
discontent
to
raise
the
people
and
proclaim
a
republic
an
institution
of
which
the
chinese
could
have
had
no
conception
it
surely
can
not
long
survive
for
the
impulse
which
has
given
birth
to
it
is
not
a
movement
of
progress
but
of
reaction
the
word
republic
to
the
chinaman
intellectualised
by
his
european
education
is
simply
synonymous
with
the
rejection
of
the
yoke
of
laws
rules
and
restraints
cutting
off
his
pigtail
covering
his
head
with
a
cap
and
calling
himself
a
republican
the
young
chinaman
thinks
to
give
the
rein
to
all
his
instincts
this
is
more
or
less
the
idea
of
a
republic
that
a
large
part
of
the
french
people
entertained
at
the
time
of
the
great
revolution
china
will
soon
discover
the
fate
that
awaits
a
society
deprived
of
the
armour
slowly
wrought
by
the
past
after
a
few
years
of
bloody
anarchy
it
will
be
necessary
to
establish
a
power
whose
tyranny
will
inevitably
be
far
severer
than
that
which
was
overthrown
science
has
not
yet
discovered
the
magic
ring
capable
of
saving
a
society
without
discipline
there
is
no
need
to
impose
discipline
when
it
has
become
hereditary
but
when
the
primitive
instincts
have
been
allowed
to
destroy
the
barriers
painfully
erected
by
slow
ancestral
labours
they
can
not
be
reconstituted
save
by
an
energetic
tyranny
as
a
proof
of
these
assertions
we
may
instance
an
experiment
analogous
to
that
undertaken
by
china
that
recently
attempted
by
turkey
a
few
years
ago
young
men
instructed
in
european
schools
and
full
of
good
intentions
succeeded
with
the
aid
of
a
number
of
officers
in
overthrowing
a
sultan
whose
tyranny
seemed
insupportable
having
acquired
our
robust
latin
faith
in
the
magic
power
of
formulae
they
thought
they
could
establish
the
representative
system
in
a
country
profoundly
divided
by
religious
hatred
and
peopled
by
divers
races
the
attempt
has
not
prospered
hitherto
the
authors
of
the
reformation
had
to
learn
that
despite
their
liberalism
they
were
forced
to
govern
by
methods
very
like
those
employed
by
the
government
overthrown
they
could
neither
prevent
summary
executions
nor
wholesale
massacres
of
christians
nor
could
they
remedy
a
single
abuse
it
would
be
unjust
to
reproach
them
what
in
truth
could
they
have
done
to
change
a
people
whose
traditions
have
been
fixed
so
long
whose
religious
passions
are
so
intense
and
whose
mohammedans
although
in
the
minority
legitimately
claim
to
govern
the
sacred
city
of
their
faith
according
to
their
code
how
prevent
islam
from
remaining
the
state
religion
in
a
country
where
civil
law
and
religious
law
are
not
yet
plainly
separated
and
where
faith
in
the
koran
is
the
only
tie
by
which
the
idea
of
nationality
can
be
maintained
it
was
difficult
to
destroy
such
a
state
of
affairs
so
that
we
were
bound
to
see
the
of
an
autocratic
organisation
with
an
appearance
of
constitutionalism
that
is
to
say
practically
the
old
system
once
again
such
attempts
afford
a
good
example
of
the
fact
that
a
people
can
not
choose
its
institutions
until
it
has
transformed
its
mind
social
elements
which
survive
the
changes
of
government
after
revolution
what
we
shall
say
later
on
as
to
the
stable
foundation
of
the
national
soul
will
enable
us
to
appreciate
the
force
of
systems
of
government
that
have
been
long
established
such
as
ancient
monarchies
a
monarch
may
easily
be
overthrown
by
conspirators
but
these
latter
are
powerless
against
the
principles
which
the
monarch
represents
napoleon
at
his
fall
was
replaced
not
by
his
natural
heir
but
by
the
heir
of
kings
the
latter
incarnated
an
ancient
principle
while
the
son
of
the
emperor
personified
ideas
that
were
as
yet
imperfectly
established
in
men
minds
for
the
same
reason
a
minister
however
able
however
great
the
services
he
has
rendered
to
his
country
can
very
rarely
overthrow
his
sovereign
bismarck
himself
could
not
have
done
so
this
great
minister
had
created
the
unity
of
germany
yet
his
master
had
only
to
touch
him
with
his
finger
and
he
vanished
a
man
is
as
nothing
before
a
principle
supported
by
opinion
but
even
when
for
various
reasons
the
principle
incarnated
by
a
government
is
annihilated
with
that
government
as
happened
at
the
time
of
the
french
revolution
all
the
elements
of
social
organisation
do
not
perish
at
the
same
time
if
we
knew
nothing
of
france
but
the
disturbances
of
the
last
hundred
years
and
more
we
might
suppose
the
country
to
live
in
a
state
of
profound
anarchy
now
her
economic
industrial
and
even
her
political
life
manifests
on
the
contrary
a
continuity
that
seems
to
be
independent
of
all
revolutions
and
governments
the
fact
is
that
beside
the
great
events
of
which
history
treats
are
the
little
facts
of
daily
life
which
the
books
neglect
to
tell
they
are
ruled
by
imperious
necessities
which
halt
for
no
man
their
total
mass
forms
the
real
framework
of
the
life
of
the
people
while
the
study
of
great
events
shows
us
that
the
nominal
government
of
france
has
been
frequently
changed
in
the
space
of
a
century
an
examination
of
the
little
daily
events
will
prove
on
the
contrary
that
her
real
government
has
been
little
altered
who
in
truth
are
the
real
rulers
of
a
people
kings
and
ministers
no
doubt
in
the
great
crises
of
national
life
but
they
play
no
part
whatever
in
the
little
realities
which
make
up
the
life
of
every
day
the
real
directing
forces
of
a
country
are
the
administrations
composed
of
impersonal
elements
which
are
never
affected
by
the
changes
of
government
conservative
of
traditions
they
are
anonymous
and
lasting
and
constitute
an
occult
power
before
which
all
others
must
eventually
bow
their
action
has
even
increased
to
such
a
degree
that
as
we
shall
presently
show
there
is
a
danger
that
they
may
form
an
anonymous
state
more
powerful
than
the
official
state
france
has
thus
come
to
be
governed
by
heads
of
departments
and
government
clerks
the
more
we
study
the
history
of
revolutions
the
more
we
discover
that
they
change
practically
nothing
but
the
label
to
create
a
revolution
is
easy
but
to
change
the
soul
of
a
people
is
difficult
indeed
chapter
iv
the
part
played
by
the
people
in
revolutions
the
stability
and
malleability
of
the
national
mind
the
knowledge
of
a
people
at
any
given
moment
of
its
history
involves
an
understanding
of
its
environment
and
above
all
of
its
past
theoretically
one
may
deny
that
past
as
did
the
men
of
the
revolution
as
many
men
of
the
present
day
have
done
but
its
influence
remains
indestructible
in
the
past
built
up
by
slow
accumulations
of
centuries
was
formed
the
aggregation
of
thoughts
sentiments
traditions
and
prejudices
constituting
the
national
mind
which
makes
the
strength
of
a
race
without
it
no
progress
is
possible
each
generation
would
necessitate
a
fresh
beginning
the
aggregate
composing
the
soul
of
a
people
is
solidly
established
only
if
it
possesses
a
certain
rigidity
but
this
rigidity
must
not
pass
a
certain
limit
or
there
would
be
no
such
thing
as
malleability
without
rigidity
the
ancestral
soul
would
have
no
fixity
and
without
malleability
it
could
not
adapt
itself
to
the
changes
of
environment
resulting
from
the
progress
of
civilization
excessive
malleability
of
the
national
mind
impels
a
people
to
incessant
revolutions
excess
of
rigidity
leads
it
to
decadence
living
species
like
the
races
of
humanity
disappear
when
too
fixedly
established
by
a
long
past
they
become
incapable
of
adapting
themselves
to
new
conditions
of
existence
few
peoples
have
succeeded
in
effecting
a
just
equilibrium
between
these
two
contrary
qualities
of
stability
and
malleability
the
romans
in
antiquity
and
the
english
in
modern
times
may
be
cited
among
those
who
have
best
attained
it
the
peoples
whose
mind
is
most
fixed
and
established
often
effect
the
most
violent
revolutions
not
having
succeeded
in
evolving
progressively
in
adapting
themselves
to
changes
of
environment
they
are
forced
to
adapt
themselves
violently
when
such
adaptation
becomes
indispensable
stability
is
only
acquired
very
slowly
the
history
of
a
race
is
above
all
the
story
of
its
long
efforts
to
establish
its
mind
so
long
as
it
has
not
succeeded
it
forms
a
horde
of
barbarians
without
cohesion
and
strength
after
the
invasions
of
the
end
of
the
roman
empire
france
took
several
centuries
to
form
a
national
soul
she
finally
achieved
one
but
in
the
course
of
centuries
this
soul
finally
became
too
rigid
with
a
little
more
malleability
the
ancient
monarchy
would
have
been
slowly
transformed
as
it
was
elsewhere
and
we
should
have
avoided
together
with
the
revolution
and
its
consequences
the
heavy
task
of
remaking
a
national
soul
the
preceding
considerations
show
us
the
part
of
race
in
the
genesis
of
revolutions
and
explain
why
the
same
revolutions
will
produce
such
different
effects
in
different
countries
why
for
example
the
ideas
of
the
french
revolution
welcomed
with
such
enthusiasm
by
some
peoples
were
rejected
by
others
certainly
england
although
a
very
stable
country
has
suffered
two
revolutions
and
slain
a
king
but
the
mould
of
her
mental
armour
was
at
once
stable
enough
to
retain
the
acquisitions
of
the
past
and
malleable
enough
to
modify
them
only
within
the
necessary
limits
never
did
england
dream
as
did
the
men
of
the
french
revolution
of
destroying
the
ancestral
heritage
in
order
to
erect
a
new
society
in
the
name
of
reason
while
the
frenchman
writes
sorel
despised
his
government
detested
his
clergy
hated
the
nobility
and
revolted
against
the
laws
the
englishman
was
proud
of
his
religion
his
constitution
his
aristocracy
his
house
of
lords
these
were
like
so
many
towers
of
the
formidable
bastille
in
which
he
entrenched
himself
under
the
british
standard
to
judge
europe
and
cover
her
with
contempt
he
admitted
that
the
command
was
disputed
inside
the
fort
but
no
stranger
must
approach
the
influence
of
race
in
the
destiny
of
the
peoples
appears
plainly
in
the
history
of
the
perpetual
revolutions
of
the
spanish
republics
of
south
america
composed
of
that
is
to
say
of
individuals
whose
diverse
heredities
have
dissociated
their
ancestral
characteristics
these
populations
have
no
national
soul
and
therefore
no
stability
a
people
of
is
always
ungovernable
if
we
would
learn
more
of
the
differences
of
political
capacity
which
the
racial
factor
creates
we
must
examine
the
same
nation
as
governed
by
two
races
successively
the
event
is
not
rare
in
history
it
has
been
manifested
in
a
striking
manner
of
late
in
cuba
and
the
philippines
which
passed
suddenly
from
the
rule
of
spain
to
that
of
the
united
states
we
know
in
what
anarchy
and
poverty
cuba
existed
under
spanish
rule
we
know
too
to
what
a
degree
of
prosperity
the
island
was
brought
in
a
few
years
when
it
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
united
states
the
same
experience
was
repeated
in
the
philippines
which
for
centuries
had
been
governed
by
spain
finally
the
country
was
no
more
than
a
vast
jungle
the
home
of
epidemics
of
every
kind
where
a
miserable
population
vegetated
without
commerce
or
industry
after
a
few
years
of
american
rule
the
country
was
entirely
transformed
malaria
yellow
fever
plague
and
cholera
had
entirely
disappeared
the
swamps
were
drained
the
country
was
covered
with
railways
factories
and
schools
in
thirteen
years
the
mortality
was
reduced
by
it
is
to
such
examples
that
we
must
refer
the
theorist
who
has
not
yet
grasped
the
profound
significance
of
the
word
race
and
how
far
the
ancestral
soul
of
a
people
rules
over
its
destiny
how
the
people
regards
revolution
the
part
of
the
people
has
been
the
same
in
all
revolutions
it
is
never
the
people
that
conceives
them
nor
directs
them
its
activity
is
released
by
means
of
leaders
only
when
the
direct
interests
of
the
people
are
involved
do
we
see
as
recently
in
champagne
any
fraction
of
the
people
rising
spontaneously
a
movement
thus
localised
constitutes
a
mere
riot
revolution
is
easy
when
the
leaders
are
very
influential
of
this
portugal
and
brazil
have
recently
furnished
proofs
but
new
ideas
penetrate
the
people
very
slowly
indeed
generally
it
accepts
a
revolution
without
knowing
why
and
when
by
chance
it
does
succeed
in
understanding
why
the
revolution
is
over
long
ago
the
people
will
create
a
revolution
because
it
is
persuaded
to
do
so
but
it
does
not
understand
very
much
of
the
ideas
of
its
leaders
it
interprets
them
in
its
own
fashion
and
this
fashion
is
by
no
means
that
of
the
true
authors
of
the
revolution
the
french
revolution
furnished
a
striking
example
of
this
fact
the
revolution
of
had
as
its
real
object
the
substitution
of
the
power
of
the
nobility
by
that
of
the
bourgeoisie
that
is
an
old
elite
which
had
become
incapable
was
to
be
replaced
by
a
new
elite
which
did
possess
capacity
there
was
little
question
of
the
people
in
this
first
phase
of
the
revolution
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
was
proclaimed
but
it
amounted
only
to
the
right
of
electing
its
representatives
extremely
illiterate
not
hoping
like
the
middle
classes
to
ascend
the
social
scale
not
in
any
way
feeling
itself
the
equal
of
the
nobles
and
not
aspiring
ever
to
become
their
equal
the
people
had
views
and
interests
very
different
to
those
of
the
upper
classes
of
society
the
struggles
of
the
assembly
with
the
royal
power
led
it
to
call
for
the
intervention
of
the
people
in
these
struggles
it
intervened
more
and
more
and
the
bourgeois
revolution
rapidly
became
a
popular
revolution
an
idea
having
no
force
of
its
own
and
acting
only
by
virtue
of
possessing
an
affective
and
mystic
substratum
which
supports
it
the
theoretical
ideas
of
the
bourgeoisie
before
they
could
act
on
the
people
had
to
be
transformed
into
a
new
and
very
definite
faith
springing
from
obvious
practical
interests
this
transformation
was
rapidly
effected
when
the
people
heard
the
men
envisaged
by
it
as
the
government
assuring
it
that
it
was
the
equal
of
its
former
masters
it
began
to
regard
itself
as
a
victim
and
proceeded
to
pillage
burn
and
massacre
imagining
that
in
so
doing
it
was
exercising
a
right
the
great
strength
of
the
revolutionary
principles
was
that
they
gave
a
free
course
to
the
instincts
of
primitive
barbarity
which
had
been
restrained
by
the
secular
and
inhibitory
action
of
environment
tradition
and
law
all
the
social
bonds
that
formerly
contained
the
multitude
were
day
by
day
dissolving
so
that
it
conceived
a
notion
of
unlimited
power
and
the
joy
of
seeing
its
ancient
masters
ferreted
out
and
despoiled
having
become
the
sovereign
people
were
not
all
things
permissible
to
it
the
motto
of
liberty
equality
fraternity
a
true
manifestation
of
hope
and
faith
at
the
beginning
of
the
revolution
soon
merely
served
to
cover
a
legal
justification
of
the
sentiments
of
jealousy
cupidity
and
hatred
of
superiors
the
true
motives
of
crowds
unrestrained
by
discipline
this
is
why
the
revolution
so
soon
ended
in
disorder
violence
and
anarchy
from
the
moment
when
the
revolution
descended
from
the
middle
to
the
lower
classes
of
society
it
ceased
to
be
a
domination
of
the
instinctive
by
the
rational
and
became
on
the
contrary
the
effort
of
the
instinctive
to
overpower
the
rational
this
legal
triumph
of
the
atavistic
instincts
was
terrible
the
whole
effort
of
societies
an
effort
indispensable
to
their
continued
existence
had
always
been
to
restrain
thanks
to
the
power
of
tradition
customs
and
codes
certain
natural
instincts
which
man
has
inherited
from
his
primitive
animality
it
is
possible
to
dominate
them
and
the
more
a
people
does
overcome
them
the
more
civilised
it
is
but
they
can
not
be
destroyed
the
influence
of
various
exciting
causes
will
readily
result
in
their
reappearance
this
is
why
the
liberation
of
popular
passions
is
so
dangerous
the
torrent
once
escaped
from
its
bed
does
not
return
until
it
has
spread
devastation
far
and
wide
woe
to
him
who
stirs
up
the
dregs
of
a
nation
said
rivarol
at
the
beginning
of
the
revolution
there
is
no
age
of
enlightenment
for
the
populace
the
supposed
part
of
the
people
during
revolution
the
laws
of
the
psychology
of
crowds
show
us
that
the
people
never
acts
without
leaders
and
that
although
it
plays
a
considerable
part
in
revolutions
by
following
and
exaggerating
the
impulses
received
it
never
directs
its
own
movements
in
all
political
revolutions
we
discover
the
action
of
leaders
they
do
not
create
the
ideas
which
serve
as
the
basis
of
revolutions
but
they
utilise
them
as
a
means
of
action
ideas
leaders
armies
and
crowds
constitute
four
elements
which
all
have
their
part
to
play
in
revolutions
the
crowd
roused
by
the
leaders
acts
especially
by
means
of
its
mass
its
action
is
comparable
to
that
of
the
shell
which
perforates
an
by
the
momentum
of
a
force
it
did
not
create
rarely
does
the
crowd
understand
anything
of
the
revolutions
accomplished
with
its
assistance
it
obediently
follows
its
leaders
without
even
trying
to
find
out
what
they
want
it
overthrew
charles
because
of
his
ordinances
without
having
any
idea
of
the
contents
of
the
latter
and
would
have
been
greatly
embarrassed
had
it
been
asked
at
a
later
date
why
it
overthrew
deceived
by
appearances
many
authors
from
michelet
to
aulard
have
supposed
that
the
people
effected
our
great
revolution
the
principal
actor
said
michelet
is
the
people
it
is
an
error
to
say
writes
aulard
that
the
french
revolution
was
effected
by
a
few
distinguished
people
or
a
few
heroes
i
believe
that
in
the
whole
history
of
the
period
included
between
and
not
a
single
person
stands
out
who
led
or
shaped
events
neither
louis
xvi
nor
mirabeau
nor
danton
nor
robespierre
must
we
say
that
it
was
the
french
people
that
was
the
real
hero
of
the
french
revolution
yes
provided
we
see
the
french
people
not
as
a
multitude
but
as
a
number
of
organised
groups
and
in
a
recent
work
cochin
insists
on
this
conception
of
popular
action
and
here
is
the
wonder
michelet
is
right
in
proportion
as
we
know
them
better
the
facts
seem
to
consecrate
the
fiction
this
crowd
without
chiefs
and
without
laws
the
very
image
of
chaos
did
for
five
years
govern
and
command
speak
and
act
with
a
precision
a
consistency
and
an
entirety
that
were
marvellous
anarchy
gave
lessons
in
order
and
discipline
to
the
defeated
party
of
order
millions
of
men
spread
over
an
area
of
square
leagues
acted
as
one
certainly
if
this
simultaneous
conduct
of
the
people
had
been
spontaneous
as
the
author
supposes
it
would
have
been
marvellous
aulard
himself
understands
very
well
the
impossibilities
of
such
a
phenomenon
for
he
is
careful
in
speaking
of
the
people
to
say
that
he
is
speaking
of
groups
and
that
these
groups
may
have
been
guided
by
leaders
and
what
then
cemented
the
national
unity
who
saved
this
nation
attacked
by
the
king
and
rent
by
civil
war
was
it
danton
was
it
robespierre
was
it
carnot
certainly
these
individual
men
were
of
service
but
unity
was
in
fact
maintained
and
independence
assured
by
the
grouping
of
the
french
into
communes
and
popular
societies
people
clubs
it
was
the
municipal
and
jacobin
organisation
of
france
that
forced
the
coalition
of
europe
to
retreat
but
in
each
group
if
we
look
more
closely
there
were
two
or
three
individuals
more
capable
than
the
rest
who
whether
leaders
or
led
executed
decisions
and
had
the
appearance
of
leaders
but
who
if
for
instance
we
read
the
proceedings
of
the
people
clubs
seem
to
us
to
have
drawn
their
strength
far
more
from
their
group
than
from
themselves
aulard
mistake
consists
in
supposing
that
all
these
groups
were
derived
from
a
spontaneous
movement
of
fraternity
and
reason
france
at
that
time
was
covered
with
thousands
of
little
clubs
receiving
a
single
impulsion
from
the
great
jacobin
club
of
paris
and
obeying
it
with
perfect
docility
this
is
what
reality
teaches
us
though
the
illusions
of
the
jacobins
do
not
permit
them
to
accept
the
fact
in
the
historical
manuals
which
aulard
has
prepared
for
the
use
of
classes
in
collaboration
with
debidour
the
role
attributed
to
the
people
as
an
entity
is
even
more
marked
we
see
it
intervening
continually
and
spontaneously
here
are
a
few
examples
the
day
of
june
the
the
king
dismissed
the
girondist
members
the
people
of
paris
indignant
rose
spontaneously
and
invaded
the
tuileries
the
day
of
august
the
legislative
assembly
dared
not
overthrow
it
it
was
the
people
of
paris
aided
by
the
federals
of
the
departments
who
effected
this
revolution
at
the
price
of
its
blood
the
conflict
of
the
girondists
and
the
mountain
this
discord
in
the
face
of
the
enemy
was
dangerous
the
people
put
an
end
to
it
on
the
days
of
the
of
may
and
the
of
june
when
it
forced
the
convention
to
expel
the
leaders
of
the
gironde
from
its
midst
and
to
decree
their
arrest
the
popular
entity
and
its
constituent
elements
in
order
to
answer
to
certain
theoretical
conceptions
the
people
was
erected
into
a
mystic
entity
endowed
with
all
the
powers
and
all
the
virtues
incessantly
praised
by
the
politicians
and
overwhelmed
with
flattery
we
shall
see
what
we
are
to
make
of
this
conception
of
the
part
played
by
the
people
in
the
french
revolution
to
the
jacobins
of
this
epoch
as
to
those
of
our
own
days
this
popular
entity
constitutes
a
superior
personality
possessing
the
attributes
peculiar
to
divinities
of
never
having
to
answer
for
its
actions
and
never
making
a
mistake
its
wishes
must
be
humbly
acceded
the
people
may
kill
burn
ravage
commit
the
most
frightful
cruelties
glorify
its
hero
and
throw
him
into
the
gutter
it
is
all
one
the
politicians
will
not
cease
to
vaunt
its
virtues
its
high
wisdom
and
to
bow
to
its
every
decision
these
pretensions
do
at
least
seem
to
be
growing
untenable
to
the
more
advanced
republicans
the
rage
with
the
socialists
writes
clemenceau
is
to
endow
with
all
the
virtues
as
though
by
a
superhuman
reason
the
crowd
whose
reason
can
not
be
much
to
boast
of
the
famous
statesman
might
say
more
correctly
that
reason
not
only
can
not
be
prominent
in
the
crowd
but
is
practically
nonexistent
now
in
what
does
this
entity
really
consist
this
mysterious
fetich
which
revolutionists
have
revered
for
more
than
a
century
it
may
be
decomposed
into
two
distinct
categories
the
first
includes
the
peasants
traders
and
workers
of
all
sorts
who
need
tranquillity
and
order
that
they
may
exercise
their
calling
this
people
forms
the
majority
but
a
majority
which
never
caused
a
revolution
living
in
laborious
silence
it
is
ignored
by
the
historians
the
second
category
which
plays
a
capital
part
in
all
national
disturbances
consists
of
a
subversive
social
residue
dominated
by
a
criminal
mentality
degenerates
of
alcoholism
and
poverty
thieves
beggars
destitute
casuals
indifferent
workers
without
employment
these
constitute
the
dangerous
bulk
of
the
armies
of
insurrection
the
fear
of
punishment
prevents
many
of
them
from
becoming
criminals
at
ordinary
times
but
they
do
become
criminals
as
soon
as
they
can
exercise
their
evil
instincts
without
danger
to
this
sinister
substratum
are
due
the
massacres
which
stain
all
revolutions
it
was
this
class
which
guided
by
its
leaders
continually
invaded
the
great
revolutionary
assemblies
these
regiments
of
disorder
had
no
other
ideal
than
that
of
massacre
pillage
and
incendiarism
their
indifference
to
theories
and
principles
was
complete
to
the
elements
recruited
from
the
lowest
dregs
of
the
populace
are
added
by
way
of
contagion
a
host
of
idle
and
indifferent
persons
who
are
simply
drawn
into
the
movement
they
shout
because
there
are
men
shouting
and
revolt
because
there
is
a
revolt
without
having
the
vaguest
idea
of
the
cause
of
shouting
or
revolution
the
suggestive
power
of
their
environment
absolutely
hypnotises
them
and
impels
them
to
action
these
noisy
and
maleficent
crowds
the
kernel
of
all
insurrections
from
antiquity
to
our
own
times
are
the
only
crowds
known
to
the
orator
to
the
orator
they
are
the
sovereign
people
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
sovereign
people
is
principally
composed
of
the
lower
populace
of
whom
thiers
said
since
the
time
when
tacitus
saw
it
applaud
the
crimes
of
the
emperors
the
vile
populace
has
not
changed
these
barbarians
who
swarm
at
the
bottom
of
societies
are
always
ready
to
stain
the
people
with
every
crime
at
the
beck
of
every
power
and
to
the
dishonour
of
every
cause
at
no
period
of
history
was
the
role
of
the
lowest
elements
of
the
population
exercised
in
such
a
lasting
fashion
as
in
the
french
revolution
the
massacres
began
as
soon
as
the
beast
was
unchained
that
is
from
long
before
the
convention
they
were
carried
out
with
all
possible
refinements
of
cruelty
during
the
killing
of
september
the
prisoners
were
slowly
chopped
to
bits
by
cuts
in
order
to
prolong
their
agonies
and
amuse
the
spectators
who
experienced
the
greatest
delight
before
the
spectacle
of
the
convulsions
of
the
victims
and
their
shrieks
of
agony
similar
scenes
were
observed
all
over
france
even
in
the
early
days
of
the
revolution
although
the
foreign
war
did
not
excuse
them
then
nor
any
other
pretext
from
march
to
september
a
whole
series
of
burnings
killings
and
pillagings
drenched
all
france
in
blood
taine
cites
one
hundred
and
twenty
such
cases
rouen
lyons
strasbourg
fell
into
the
power
of
the
populace
the
mayor
of
troyes
his
eyes
destroyed
by
blows
of
scissors
was
murdered
after
hours
of
suffering
the
colonel
of
dragoons
belzuce
was
cut
to
pieces
while
living
in
many
places
the
hearts
of
the
victims
were
torn
out
and
carried
about
the
cities
on
the
point
of
a
pike
such
is
the
behaviour
of
the
base
populace
so
soon
as
imprudent
hands
have
broken
the
network
of
constraints
which
binds
its
ancestral
savagery
it
meets
with
every
indulgence
because
it
is
in
the
interests
of
the
politicians
to
flatter
it
but
let
us
for
a
moment
suppose
the
thousands
of
beings
who
constitute
it
condensed
into
one
single
being
the
personality
thus
formed
would
appear
as
a
cruel
and
narrow
and
abominable
monster
more
horrible
than
the
bloodiest
tyrants
of
history
this
impulsive
and
ferocious
people
has
always
been
easily
dominated
so
soon
as
a
strong
power
has
opposed
it
if
its
violence
is
unlimited
so
is
its
servility
all
the
despotisms
have
had
it
for
their
servant
the
caesars
are
certain
of
being
acclaimed
by
it
whether
they
are
named
caligula
nero
marat
robespierre
or
boulanger
beside
these
destructive
hordes
whose
action
during
revolution
is
capital
there
exists
as
we
have
already
remarked
the
mass
of
the
true
people
which
asks
only
the
right
to
labour
it
sometimes
benefits
by
revolutions
but
never
causes
them
the
revolutionary
theorists
know
little
of
it
and
distrust
it
aware
of
its
traditional
and
conservative
basis
the
resistant
nucleus
of
a
country
it
makes
the
strength
and
continuity
of
the
latter
extremely
docile
through
fear
easily
influenced
by
its
leaders
it
will
momentarily
commit
every
excess
while
under
their
influence
but
the
ancestral
inertia
of
the
race
will
soon
take
charge
again
which
is
the
reason
why
it
so
quickly
tires
of
revolution
its
traditional
soul
quickly
incites
it
to
oppose
itself
to
anarchy
when
the
latter
goes
too
far
at
such
times
it
seeks
the
leader
who
will
restore
order
this
people
resigned
and
peaceable
has
evidently
no
very
lofty
nor
complicated
political
conceptions
its
governmental
ideal
is
always
very
simple
is
something
very
like
dictatorship
this
is
why
from
the
times
of
the
greeks
to
our
own
dictatorship
has
always
followed
anarchy
it
followed
it
after
the
first
revolution
when
bonaparte
was
acclaimed
and
again
when
despite
opposition
four
successive
plebiscites
raised
louis
napoleon
to
the
head
of
the
republic
ratified
his
coup
the
empire
and
in
before
the
war
approved
of
his
rule
doubtless
in
these
last
instances
the
people
was
deceived
but
without
the
revolutionary
conspiracies
which
led
to
disorder
it
would
not
have
been
impelled
to
seek
the
means
of
escape
therefrom
the
facts
recalled
in
this
chapter
must
not
be
forgotten
if
we
wish
fully
to
comprehend
the
various
roles
of
the
people
during
revolution
its
action
is
considerable
but
very
unlike
that
imagined
by
the
legends
whose
repetition
alone
constitutes
their
vitality

have
dwelt
at

elsewhere
upon
a
certain
theory
of
character
without
which
it
is
absolutely
impossible
to
understand
divers
transformations
or
inconsistencies
of
conduct
which
occur
at

in

here
are
the
principal

creatures
of
certain
circumstances
but
not
of
all
circumstances
our
ego
consists
of
the
association
of
innumerable
cellular
egos
the
residues
of
ancestral
personalities
by
their
combination
they
form
an
equilibrium
which
is
fairly
permanent
when
the
social
environment
does
not
vary
as
soon
as
this
environment
is
considerably
modified
as
in
time
of
insurrection
this
equilibrium
is
broken
and
the
dissociated
elements
constitute
by
a
fresh
aggregation
a
new
personality
which
is
manifested
by
ideas
feelings
and
actions
very
different
from
those
formerly
observed
in
the
same
individual
thus
it
is
that
during
the
terror
we
see
honest
bourgeois
and
peaceful
magistrates
who
were
noted
for
their
kindness
turned
into
bloodthirsty
fanatics
under
the
influence
of
environment
the
old
personality
may
therefore
give
place
to
one
entirely
new
for
this
reason
the
actors
in
great
religious
and
political
crises
often
seem
of
a
different
essence
to
ourselves
yet
they
do
not
differ
from
us
the
repetition
of
the
same
events
would
bring
back
the
same
men
napoleon
perfectly
understood
these
possibilities
of
character
when
he
said
in
saint
helena
it
is
because
i
know
just
how
great
a
part
chance
plays
in
our
political
decisions
that
i
have
always
been
without
prejudices
and
very
indulgent
as
to
the
part
men
have
taken
during
our
disturbances
in
time
of
revolution
one
can
only
say
what
one
has
done
it
would
not
be
wise
to
say
that
one
could
not
have
done
otherwise
men
are
difficult
to
understand
if
we
want
to
be
just
do
they
know
themselves
do
they
account
for
themselves
very
clearly
there
are
virtues
and
vices
of
circumstance
when
the
normal
personality
has
been
disaggregated
under
the
influence
of
certain
events
how
does
the
new
personality
form
itself
by
several
means
the
most
active
of
which
is
the
acquisition
of
a
strong
belief
this
orientates
all
the
elements
of
the
understanding
as
the
magnet
collects
into
regular
curves
the
filings
of
a
magnetic
metal
thus
were
formed
the
personalities
observed
in
times
of
great
crises
the
crusades
the
reformation
the
revolution
notably
at
normal
times
the
environment
varies
little
so
that
as
a
rule
we
see
only
a
single
personality
in
the
individuals
that
surround
us
sometimes
however
it
happens
that
we
observe
several
which
in
certain
circumstances
may
replace
one
another
these
personalities
may
be
contradictory
and
even
inimical
this
phenomenon
exceptional
under
normal
conditions
is
considerably
accentuated
in
certain
pathological
conditions
morbid
psychology
has
recorded
several
examples
of
multiple
personality
in
a
single
subject
such
as
the
cases
cited
by
morton
prince
and
pierre
janet
in
all
these
variations
of
personality
it
is
not
the
intelligence
which
is
modified
but
the
feelings
whose
association
forms
the
character
elements
of
character
predominant
in
time
of
revolution
during
revolution
we
see
several
sentiments
developed
which
are
commonly
repressed
but
to
which
the
destruction
of
social
constraints
gives
a
free
vent
these
constraints
consisting
of
the
law
morality
and
tradition
are
not
always
completely
broken
some
survive
the
upheaval
and
serve
to
some
extent
to
damp
the
explosion
of
dangerous
sentiments
the
most
powerful
of
these
restraints
is
the
soul
of
the
race
this
determines
a
manner
of
seeing
feeling
and
willing
common
to
the
majority
of
the
individuals
of
the
same
people
it
constitutes
a
hereditary
custom
and
nothing
is
more
powerful
than
the
ties
of
custom
this
racial
influence
limits
the
variations
of
a
people
and
determines
its
destiny
within
certain
limits
in
spite
of
all
superficial
changes
for
example
to
take
only
the
instances
of
history
it
would
seem
that
the
mentality
of
france
must
have
varied
enormously
during
a
single
century
in
a
few
years
it
passed
from
the
revolution
to
caesarism
returned
to
the
monarchy
effected
another
revolution
and
then
summoned
a
new
caesar
in
reality
only
the
outsides
of
things
had
changed
we
can
not
insist
further
here
on
the
limits
of
national
variability
but
must
now
consider
the
influence
of
certain
affective
elements
whose
development
during
revolution
contributes
to
modify
individual
or
collective
personalities
in
particular
i
will
mention
hatred
fear
ambition
jealousy
or
envy
vanity
and
enthusiasm
we
observe
their
influence
during
several
of
the
upheavals
of
history
notably
during
the
course
of
the
french
revolution
which
will
furnish
us
with
most
of
our
examples
the
hatred
of
persons
institutions
and
things
which
animated
the
men
of
the
revolution
is
one
of
these
affective
phenomena
which
are
the
more
striking
the
more
one
studies
their
psychology
they
detested
not
only
their
enemies
but
the
members
of
their
own
party
if
one
were
to
accept
unreservedly
said
a
recent
writer
the
judgments
which
they
expressed
of
one
another
we
should
have
to
conclude
that
they
were
all
traitors
and
boasters
all
incapable
and
corrupt
all
assassins
or
tyrants
we
know
with
what
hatred
scarcely
appeased
by
the
death
of
their
enemies
men
persecuted
the
girondists
dantonists
hebertists
robespierrists
one
of
the
chief
causes
of
this
feeling
resided
in
the
fact
that
these
furious
sectaries
being
apostles
in
possession
of
the
absolute
verity
were
unable
like
all
believers
to
tolerate
the
sight
of
infidels
a
mystic
or
sentimental
certitude
is
always
accompanied
by
the
need
of
forcing
itself
on
others
is
never
convinced
and
does
not
shrink
from
wholesale
slaughter
when
it
has
the
power
to
commit
it
if
the
hatreds
that
divided
the
men
of
the
revolution
had
been
of
rational
origin
they
would
not
have
lasted
long
but
arising
from
affective
and
mystic
factors
men
could
neither
forget
nor
forgive
their
sources
being
identical
in
the
different
parties
they
manifested
themselves
on
every
hand
with
identical
violence
it
has
been
proved
by
means
of
documents
that
the
girondists
were
no
less
sanguinary
than
the
montagnards
they
were
the
first
to
declare
with
petion
that
the
vanquished
parties
should
perish
they
also
according
to
aulard
attempted
to
justify
the
massacres
of
september
the
terror
must
not
be
considered
simply
as
a
means
of
defence
but
as
the
general
process
of
destruction
to
which
triumphant
believers
have
always
treated
their
detested
enemies
men
who
can
put
up
with
the
greatest
divergence
of
ideas
can
not
tolerate
differences
of
belief
in
religious
or
political
warfare
the
vanquished
can
hope
for
no
quarter
from
sulla
who
cut
the
throats
of
two
hundred
senators
and
five
or
six
thousand
romans
to
the
men
who
suppressed
the
commune
and
shot
down
more
than
twenty
thousand
after
their
victory
this
bloody
law
has
never
failed
proved
over
and
over
again
in
the
past
it
will
doubtless
be
so
in
the
future
the
hatreds
of
the
revolution
did
not
arise
entirely
from
divergence
of
belief
other
sentiments
envy
ambition
and
also
engendered
them
the
rivalry
of
individuals
aspiring
to
power
led
the
chiefs
of
the
various
groups
in
succession
to
the
scaffold
we
must
remember
moreover
that
the
need
of
division
and
the
hatred
resulting
therefrom
seem
to
be
constituent
elements
of
the
latin
mind
they
cost
our
gaulish
ancestors
their
independence
and
had
already
struck
caesar
no
city
he
said
but
was
divided
into
two
factions
no
canton
no
village
no
house
in
which
the
spirit
of
party
did
not
breathe
it
was
very
rarely
that
a
year
went
by
without
a
city
taking
up
arms
to
attack
or
repulse
its
neighbours
as
man
has
only
recently
entered
upon
the
age
of
knowledge
and
has
always
hitherto
been
guided
by
sentiments
and
beliefs
we
may
conceive
the
vast
importance
of
hatred
as
a
factor
of
his
history
commandant
colin
professor
at
the
college
of
war
remarks
in
the
following
terms
on
the
importance
of
this
feeling
during
certain
wars
in
war
more
than
at
any
other
time
there
is
no
better
inspiring
force
than
hatred
it
was
hatred
that
made
blucher
victorious
over
napoleon
analyse
the
most
wonderful
manoeuvres
the
most
decisive
operations
and
if
they
are
not
the
work
of
an
exceptional
man
a
frederick
or
a
napoleon
you
will
find
they
are
inspired
by
passion
more
than
by
calculation
what
would
the
war
of
have
been
without
the
hatred
which
we
bore
the
germans
the
writer
might
have
added
that
the
intense
hatred
of
the
japanese
for
the
russians
who
had
so
humiliated
them
might
be
classed
among
the
causes
of
their
success
the
russian
soldiers
ignorant
of
the
very
existence
of
the
japanese
had
no
animosity
against
them
which
was
one
of
the
reasons
of
their
failure
there
was
assuredly
a
good
deal
of
talk
of
fraternity
at
the
time
of
the
revolution
and
there
is
even
more
pacificism
humanitarianism
and
solidarity
have
become
catchwords
of
the
advanced
parties
but
we
know
how
profound
are
the
hatreds
concealed
beneath
these
terms
and
what
dangers
overhang
our
modern
society
fear
plays
almost
as
large
a
part
in
revolutions
as
hatred
during
the
french
revolution
there
were
many
examples
of
great
individual
courage
and
many
exhibitions
of
collective
cowardice
facing
the
scaffold
the
men
of
the
convention
were
always
brave
in
the
extreme
but
before
the
threats
of
the
rioters
who
invaded
the
assembly
they
constantly
exhibited
an
excessive
pusillanimity
obeying
the
most
absurd
injunctions
as
we
shall
see
if
we
the
history
of
the
revolutionary
assemblies
all
the
forms
of
fear
were
observed
at
this
period
one
of
the
most
widespread
was
the
fear
of
appearing
moderate
members
of
the
assemblies
public
prosecutors
representatives
on
mission
judges
of
the
revolutionary
tribunals
all
sought
to
appear
more
advanced
than
their
rivals
fear
was
one
of
the
principal
elements
of
the
crimes
committed
at
this
period
if
by
some
miracle
it
could
have
been
eliminated
from
the
revolutionary
assemblies
their
conduct
would
have
been
quite
other
than
it
was
and
the
revolution
itself
would
have
taken
a
very
different
direction
ambition
envy
vanity
in
normal
times
the
influence
of
these
various
affective
elements
is
forcibly
contained
by
social
necessities
ambition
for
instance
is
necessarily
limited
in
a
hierarchical
form
of
society
although
the
soldier
does
sometimes
become
a
general
it
is
only
after
a
long
term
of
service
in
time
of
revolution
on
the
other
hand
there
is
no
need
to
wait
every
one
may
reach
the
upper
ranks
almost
immediately
so
that
all
ambitions
are
violently
aroused
the
humblest
man
believes
himself
fitted
for
the
highest
employments
and
by
this
very
fact
his
vanity
grows
out
of
all
measure
all
the
passions
being
more
or
less
aroused
including
ambition
and
vanity
we
see
the
development
of
jealousy
and
envy
of
those
who
have
succeeded
more
quickly
than
others
the
effect
of
jealousy
always
important
in
times
of
revolution
was
especially
so
during
the
great
french
revolution
jealousy
of
the
nobility
constituted
one
of
its
most
important
factors
the
middle
classes
had
increased
in
capacity
and
wealth
to
the
point
of
surpassing
the
nobility
although
they
mingled
with
the
nobles
more
and
more
they
felt
none
the
less
that
they
were
held
at
a
distance
and
this
they
keenly
resented
this
frame
of
mind
had
unconsciously
made
the
bourgeoisie
keen
supporters
of
the
philosophic
doctrine
of
equality
wounded
and
jealousy
were
thus
the
causes
of
hatreds
that
we
can
scarcely
conceive
today
when
the
social
influence
of
the
nobility
is
so
small
many
members
of
the
convention
carrier
marat
and
others
remembered
with
anger
that
they
had
once
occupied
subordinate
positions
in
the
establishments
of
great
nobles
mme
roland
was
never
able
to
forget
that
when
she
and
her
mother
were
invited
to
the
house
of
a
great
lady
under
the
ancien
regime
they
had
been
sent
to
dine
in
the
servants
quarters
the
philosopher
rivarol
has
very
well
described
in
the
following
passage
already
cited
by
taine
the
influence
of
wounded
love
and
jealousy
upon
the
revolutionary
hatreds
it
is
not
he
writes
the
taxes
nor
the
lettres
de
cachet
nor
any
of
the
other
abuses
of
authority
it
is
not
the
sins
of
the
intendants
nor
the
long
and
ruinous
delays
of
justice
that
has
most
angered
the
nation
it
is
the
prejudices
of
the
nobility
for
which
it
has
exhibited
the
greatest
hatred
what
proves
this
clearly
is
the
fact
that
it
is
the
bourgeois
the
men
of
letters
the
men
of
money
in
fact
all
those
who
are
jealous
of
the
nobility
who
have
raised
the
poorer
inhabitants
of
the
cities
against
them
and
the
peasants
in
the
country
districts
this
very
true
statement
partly
justifies
the
saying
of
napoleon
vanity
made
the
revolution
liberty
was
only
the
pretext
the
enthusiasm
of
the
founders
of
the
revolution
equalled
that
of
the
apostles
of
the
faith
of
mohammed
and
it
was
really
a
religion
that
the
bourgeois
of
the
first
assembly
thought
to
found
they
thought
to
have
destroyed
an
old
world
and
to
have
built
a
new
one
upon
its
ruins
never
did
illusion
more
seductive
fire
the
hearts
of
men
equality
and
fraternity
proclaimed
by
the
new
dogmas
were
to
bring
the
reign
of
eternal
happiness
to
all
the
peoples
man
had
broken
for
ever
with
a
past
of
barbarity
and
darkness
the
regenerated
world
would
in
future
be
illuminated
by
the
lucid
radiance
of
pure
reason
on
all
hands
the
most
brilliant
oratorical
formulae
saluted
the
expected
dawn
that
this
enthusiasm
was
so
soon
replaced
by
violence
was
due
to
the
fact
that
the
awakening
was
speedy
and
terrible
one
can
readily
conceive
the
indignant
fury
with
which
the
apostles
of
the
revolution
attacked
the
daily
obstacles
opposed
to
the
realisation
of
their
dreams
they
had
sought
to
reject
the
past
to
forget
tradition
to
make
man
over
again
but
the
past
reappeared
incessantly
and
men
refused
to
change
the
reformers
checked
in
their
onward
march
would
not
give
in
they
sought
to
impose
by
force
a
dictatorship
which
speedily
made
men
regret
the
system
abolished
and
finally
led
to
its
return
it
is
to
be
remarked
that
although
the
enthusiasm
of
the
first
days
did
not
last
in
the
revolutionary
assemblies
it
survived
very
much
longer
in
the
armies
and
constituted
their
chief
strength
to
tell
the
truth
the
armies
of
the
revolution
were
republican
long
before
france
became
so
and
remained
republican
long
after
france
had
ceased
to
be
so
the
variations
of
character
considered
in
this
chapter
being
conditioned
by
certain
common
aspirations
and
identical
changes
of
environment
finally
became
concrete
in
a
small
number
of
fairly
homogeneous
mentalities
speaking
only
of
the
more
characteristic
we
may
refer
them
to
four
types
the
jacobin
mystic
revolutionary
and
criminal
mentalities
chapter
ii
the
mystic
mentality
and
the
jacobin
mentality
classification
of
mentalities
predominant
in
time
of
revolution
the
classifications
without
which
the
study
of
the
sciences
is
impossible
must
necessarily
establish
the
discontinuous
in
the
continuous
and
for
that
reason
are
to
a
certain
extent
artificial
but
they
are
necessary
since
the
continuous
is
only
accessible
in
the
form
of
the
discontinuous
to
create
broad
distinctions
between
the
various
mentalities
observable
in
time
of
revolution
as
we
are
about
to
do
is
obviously
to
separate
elements
which
encroach
upon
one
another
which
are
fused
or
superimposed
we
must
resign
ourselves
to
losing
a
little
in
exactitude
in
order
to
gain
in
lucidity
the
fundamental
types
enumerated
at
the
end
of
the
preceding
chapter
and
which
we
are
about
to
describe
synthetise
groups
which
would
escape
analysis
were
we
to
attempt
to
study
them
in
all
their
complexity
we
have
shown
that
man
is
influenced
by
different
logics
which
under
normal
conditions
exist
in
juxtaposition
without
mutually
influencing
one
another
under
the
action
of
various
events
they
enter
into
mutual
conflict
and
the
irreducible
differences
which
divide
them
are
visibly
manifested
involving
considerable
individual
and
social
upheavals
mystic
logic
which
we
shall
presently
consider
as
it
appears
in
the
jacobin
mind
plays
a
very
important
part
but
it
is
not
alone
in
its
action
the
other
forms
of
logic
affective
logic
collective
logic
and
rational
logic
may
predominate
according
to
circumstances
the
mystic
mentality
leaving
aside
for
the
moment
the
influence
of
affective
rational
and
collective
logic
we
will
occupy
ourselves
solely
with
the
considerable
part
played
by
the
mystic
elements
which
have
prevailed
in
so
many
revolutions
and
notably
in
the
french
revolution
the
chief
characteristic
of
the
mystic
temperament
consists
in
the
attribution
of
a
mysterious
power
to
superior
beings
or
forces
which
are
incarnated
in
the
form
of
idols
fetiches
words
or
formulae
the
mystic
spirit
is
at
the
bottom
of
all
the
religious
and
most
political
beliefs
these
latter
would
often
vanish
could
we
deprive
them
of
the
mystic
elements
which
are
their
chief
support
grafted
on
the
sentiments
and
passionate
impulses
which
it
directs
mystic
logic
constitutes
the
might
of
the
great
popular
movements
men
who
would
be
by
no
means
ready
to
allow
themselves
to
be
killed
for
the
best
of
reasons
will
readily
sacrifice
their
lives
to
a
mystic
ideal
which
has
become
an
object
of
adoration
the
principles
of
the
revolution
speedily
inspired
a
wave
of
mystic
enthusiasm
analogous
to
those
provoked
by
the
various
religious
beliefs
which
had
preceded
it
all
they
did
was
to
change
the
orientation
of
a
mental
ancestry
which
the
centuries
had
solidified
so
there
is
nothing
astonishing
in
the
savage
zeal
of
the
men
of
the
convention
their
mystic
mentality
was
the
same
as
that
of
the
protestants
at
the
time
of
the
reformation
the
principal
heroes
of
the
terror
couthon
robespierre
were
apostles
like
polyeuctes
destroying
the
altars
of
the
false
gods
to
propagate
his
faith
they
dreamed
of
converting
the
globe
their
enthusiasm
spilled
itself
over
the
earth
persuaded
that
their
magnificent
formulae
were
sufficient
to
overturn
thrones
they
did
not
hesitate
to
declare
war
upon
kings
and
as
a
strong
faith
is
always
superior
to
a
doubtful
faith
they
victoriously
faced
all
europe
the
mystic
spirit
of
the
leaders
of
the
revolution
was
betrayed
in
the
least
details
of
their
public
life
robespierre
convinced
that
he
was
supported
by
the
almighty
assured
his
hearers
in
a
speech
that
the
supreme
being
had
decreed
the
republic
since
the
beginning
of
time
in
his
quality
of
high
pontiff
of
a
state
religion
he
made
the
convention
vote
a
decree
declaring
that
the
french
people
recognises
the
existence
of
the
supreme
being
and
the
immortality
of
the
soul
at
the
festival
of
this
supreme
being
seated
on
a
kind
of
throne
he
preached
a
lengthy
sermon
the
jacobin
club
directed
by
robespierre
finally
assumed
all
the
functions
of
a
council
there
maximilien
proclaimed
the
idea
of
a
great
being
who
watches
over
oppressed
innocence
and
who
punishes
triumphant
crime
all
the
heretics
who
criticised
the
jacobin
orthodoxy
were
excommunicated
that
is
were
sent
to
the
revolutionary
tribunal
which
they
left
only
for
the
scaffold
the
mystic
mentality
of
which
robespierre
was
the
most
celebrated
representative
did
not
die
with
him
men
of
identical
mentality
are
to
be
found
among
the
french
politicians
of
the
old
religious
beliefs
no
longer
rule
their
minds
but
they
are
the
creatures
of
political
creeds
which
they
would
very
soon
force
on
others
as
did
robespierre
if
they
had
the
chance
of
so
doing
always
ready
to
kill
if
killing
would
spread
their
faith
the
mystics
of
all
ages
have
employed
the
same
means
of
persuasion
as
soon
as
they
have
become
the
masters
it
is
therefore
quite
natural
that
robespierre
should
still
have
many
admirers
minds
moulded
like
his
are
to
be
met
with
in
their
thousands
his
conceptions
were
not
guillotined
with
him
old
as
humanity
they
will
only
disappear
with
the
last
believer
this
mystic
aspect
of
all
revolutions
has
escaped
the
majority
of
the
historians
they
will
persist
for
a
long
time
yet
in
trying
to
explain
by
means
of
rational
logic
a
host
of
phenomena
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
reason
i
have
already
cited
a
passage
from
the
history
of
mm
lavisse
and
rambaud
in
which
the
reformation
is
explained
as
the
result
of
the
free
individual
reflections
suggested
to
simple
folk
by
an
extremely
pious
conscience
and
a
bold
and
courageous
reason
such
movements
are
never
comprehended
by
those
who
imagine
that
their
origin
is
rational
political
or
religious
the
beliefs
which
have
moved
the
world
possess
a
common
origin
and
follow
the
same
laws
they
are
formed
not
by
the
reason
but
more
often
contrary
to
reason
buddhism
christianity
islamism
the
reformation
sorcery
jacobinism
socialism
spiritualism
seem
very
different
forms
of
belief
but
they
have
i
repeat
identical
mystic
and
affective
bases
and
obey
forms
of
logic
which
have
no
affinity
with
rational
logic
their
might
resides
precisely
in
the
fact
that
reason
has
as
little
power
to
create
them
as
to
transform
them
the
mystic
mentality
of
our
modern
political
apostles
is
strongly
marked
in
an
article
dealing
with
one
of
our
recent
ministers
which
i
cite
from
a
leading
journal
one
may
ask
into
what
category
does
a
fall
could
we
say
for
instance
that
he
belongs
to
the
group
of
unbelievers
far
from
it
certainly
a
has
not
adopted
any
positive
faith
certainly
he
curses
rome
and
geneva
rejecting
all
the
traditional
dogmas
and
all
the
known
churches
but
if
he
makes
a
clean
sweep
it
is
in
order
to
found
his
own
church
on
the
ground
so
cleared
a
church
more
dogmatic
than
all
the
rest
and
his
own
inquisition
whose
brutal
intolerance
would
have
no
reason
to
envy
the
most
notorious
of
torquemadas
can
not
he
says
such
a
thing
as
scholastic
neutrality
we
demand
lay
instruction
in
all
its
plenitude
and
are
consequently
the
enemies
of
educational
liberty
if
he
does
not
suggest
erecting
the
stake
and
the
pyre
it
is
only
on
account
of
the
evolution
of
manners
which
he
is
forced
to
take
into
account
to
a
certain
extent
whether
he
will
or
no
but
not
being
able
to
commit
men
to
the
torture
he
invokes
the
secular
arm
to
condemn
their
doctrines
to
death
this
is
exactly
the
point
of
view
of
the
great
inquisitors
it
is
the
same
attack
upon
thought
this
freethinker
has
so
free
a
spirit
that
every
philosophy
he
does
not
accept
appears
to
him
not
only
ridiculous
and
grotesque
but
criminal
he
flatters
himself
that
he
alone
is
in
possession
of
the
absolute
truth
of
this
he
is
so
entirely
sure
that
everyone
who
contradicts
him
seems
to
him
an
execrable
monster
and
a
public
enemy
he
does
not
suspect
for
a
moment
that
after
all
his
personal
views
are
only
hypotheses
and
that
he
is
all
the
more
laughable
for
claiming
a
divine
right
for
them
precisely
because
they
deny
divinity
or
at
least
they
profess
to
do
so
but
they
it
in
another
shape
which
immediately
makes
one
regret
the
old
a
is
a
sectary
of
the
goddess
reason
of
whom
he
has
made
a
moloch
an
oppressive
deity
hungry
for
sacrifice
no
more
liberty
of
thought
for
any
one
except
for
himself
and
his
friends
such
is
the
free
thought
of
a
the
outlook
is
truly
attractive
but
perhaps
too
many
idols
have
been
cast
down
during
the
last
few
centuries
for
men
to
bow
before
this
one
we
must
hope
for
the
sake
of
liberty
that
these
gloomy
fanatics
will
never
finally
become
our
masters
given
the
silent
power
of
reason
over
mystic
beliefs
it
is
quite
useless
to
seek
to
discuss
as
is
so
often
done
the
rational
value
of
revolutionary
or
political
ideas
only
their
influence
can
interest
us
it
matters
little
that
the
theories
of
the
supposed
equality
of
men
the
original
goodness
of
mankind
the
possibility
of
society
by
means
of
laws
have
been
given
the
lie
by
observation
and
experience
these
empty
illusions
must
be
counted
among
the
most
potent
motives
of
action
that
humanity
has
known
the
jacobin
mentality
although
the
term
jacobin
mentality
does
not
really
belong
to
any
true
classification
i
employ
it
here
because
it
sums
up
a
clearly
defined
combination
which
constitutes
a
veritable
psychological
species
this
mentality
dominates
the
men
of
the
french
revolution
but
is
not
peculiar
to
them
as
it
still
represents
one
of
the
most
active
elements
in
our
politics
the
mystic
mentality
which
we
have
already
considered
is
an
essential
factor
of
the
jacobin
mind
but
it
is
not
in
itself
enough
to
constitute
that
mind
other
elements
which
we
shall
now
examine
must
be
added
the
jacobins
do
not
in
the
least
suspect
their
mysticism
on
the
contrary
they
profess
to
be
guided
solely
by
pure
reason
during
the
revolution
they
invoked
reason
incessantly
and
considered
it
as
their
only
guide
to
conduct
the
majority
of
historians
have
adopted
this
rationalist
conception
of
the
jacobin
mind
and
taine
fell
into
the
same
error
it
is
in
the
abuse
of
rationalism
that
he
seeks
the
origin
of
a
great
proportion
of
the
acts
of
the
jacobins
the
pages
in
which
he
has
dealt
with
the
subject
contain
many
truths
however
and
as
they
are
in
other
ways
very
remarkable
i
reproduce
the
most
important
passages
here
neither
exaggerated
nor
dogmatic
reasoning
is
rare
in
the
human
species
in
all
countries
these
two
roots
of
the
jacobin
spirit
subsist
secret
and
indestructible
at
twenty
years
of
age
when
a
young
man
is
entering
into
the
world
his
reason
is
stimulated
simultaneously
with
his
pride
in
the
first
place
whatever
society
he
may
move
in
it
is
contemptible
to
pure
reason
for
it
has
not
been
constructed
by
a
philosophic
legislator
according
to
a
principle
but
successive
generations
have
arranged
it
according
to
their
multiple
and
needs
it
is
not
the
work
of
logic
but
of
history
and
the
young
reasoner
shrugs
his
shoulders
at
the
sight
of
this
old
building
whose
site
is
arbitrary
whose
architecture
is
incoherent
and
whose
inconveniences
are
obvious
the
majority
of
young
people
above
all
those
who
have
their
way
to
make
are
more
or
less
jacobin
on
leaving
college
jacobinism
is
born
of
social
decomposition
just
as
mushrooms
are
born
of
a
fermenting
soil
consider
the
authentic
monuments
of
its
thought
the
speeches
of
robespierre
and
the
debates
of
the
legislative
assembly
and
the
convention
the
harangues
addresses
and
reports
of
girondists
and
montagnards
never
did
men
speak
so
much
to
say
so
little
the
empty
verbiage
and
swollen
emphasis
swamp
any
truth
there
may
be
beneath
their
monotony
and
their
turgidity
the
jacobin
is
full
of
respect
for
the
phantoms
of
his
reasoning
brain
in
his
eyes
they
are
more
real
than
living
men
and
their
suffrage
is
the
only
suffrage
he
recognises
he
will
march
onward
in
all
sincerity
at
the
head
of
a
procession
of
imaginary
followers
the
millions
of
metaphysical
wills
which
he
has
created
in
the
image
of
his
own
will
sustain
him
by
their
unanimous
assent
and
he
will
project
outwards
like
a
chorus
of
triumph
and
acclamation
the
inward
echo
of
his
own
voice
while
admiring
taine
description
i
think
he
has
not
exactly
grasped
the
psychology
of
the
jacobin
the
mind
of
the
true
jacobin
at
the
time
of
the
revolution
as
now
was
composed
of
elements
which
we
must
analyse
if
we
are
to
understand
its
function
this
analysis
will
show
in
the
first
place
that
the
jacobin
is
not
a
rationalist
but
a
believer
far
from
building
his
belief
on
reason
he
moulds
reason
to
his
belief
and
although
his
speeches
are
steeped
in
rationalism
he
employs
it
very
little
in
his
thoughts
and
his
conduct
a
jacobin
who
reasoned
as
much
as
he
is
accused
of
reasoning
would
be
sometimes
accessible
to
the
voice
of
reason
now
observation
proves
from
the
time
of
the
revolution
to
our
own
days
that
the
jacobin
is
never
influenced
by
reasoning
however
just
and
it
is
precisely
here
that
his
strength
resides
and
why
is
he
not
accessible
to
reason
simply
because
his
vision
of
things
always
extremely
limited
does
not
permit
of
his
resisting
the
powerful
and
passionate
impulses
which
guide
him
these
two
elements
feeble
reason
and
strong
passions
would
not
of
themselves
constitute
the
jacobin
mind
there
is
another
passion
supports
convictions
but
hardly
ever
creates
them
now
the
true
jacobin
has
forcible
convictions
what
is
to
sustain
them
here
the
mystic
elements
whose
action
we
have
already
studied
come
into
play
the
jacobin
is
a
mystic
who
has
replaced
the
old
divinities
by
new
gods
imbued
with
the
power
of
words
and
formulae
he
attributes
to
these
a
mysterious
power
to
serve
these
exigent
divinities
he
does
not
shrink
from
the
most
violent
measures
the
laws
voted
by
our
modern
jacobins
furnish
a
proof
of
this
fact
the
jacobin
mentality
is
found
especially
in
narrow
and
passionate
characters
it
implies
in
fact
a
narrow
and
rigid
mind
inaccessible
to
all
criticism
and
to
all
considerations
but
those
of
faith
the
mystic
and
affective
elements
which
dominate
the
mind
of
the
jacobin
condemn
him
to
an
extreme
simplicity
grasping
only
the
superficial
relations
of
things
nothing
prevents
him
from
taking
for
realities
the
chimerical
images
which
are
born
of
his
imagination
the
sequence
of
phenomena
and
their
results
escape
him
he
never
raises
his
eyes
from
his
dream
as
we
may
see
it
is
not
by
the
development
of
his
logical
reason
that
the
jacobin
exceeds
he
possesses
very
little
logic
of
this
kind
and
therefore
he
often
becomes
dangerous
where
a
superior
man
would
hesitate
or
halt
the
jacobin
who
has
placed
his
feeble
reason
at
the
service
of
his
impulses
goes
forward
with
certainty
so
that
although
the
jacobin
is
a
great
reasoner
this
does
not
mean
that
he
is
in
the
least
guided
by
reason
when
he
imagines
he
is
being
led
by
reason
it
is
really
his
passions
and
his
mysticism
that
lead
him
like
all
those
who
are
convinced
and
hemmed
in
by
the
walls
of
faith
he
can
never
escape
therefrom
a
true
aggressive
theologian
he
is
astonishingly
like
the
disciples
of
calvin
described
in
a
previous
chapter
hypnotised
by
their
faith
nothing
could
deter
them
from
their
object
all
those
who
contradicted
their
articles
of
faith
were
considered
worthy
of
death
they
too
seemed
to
be
powerful
reasoners
ignorant
like
the
jacobins
of
the
secret
forces
that
led
them
they
believed
that
reason
was
their
sole
guide
while
in
reality
they
were
the
slaves
of
mysticism
and
passion
the
truly
rationalistic
jacobin
would
be
incomprehensible
and
would
merely
make
reason
despair
the
passionate
and
mystical
jacobin
is
on
the
contrary
easily
intelligible
with
these
three
elements
a
very
weak
reasoning
power
very
strong
passions
and
an
intense
mysticism
we
have
the
true
psychological
components
of
the
mind
of
the
jacobin
chapter
iii
the
revolutionary
and
criminal
mentalities
the
revolutionary
mentality
we
have
just
seen
that
the
mystic
elements
are
one
of
the
components
of
the
jacobin
mentality
we
shall
now
see
that
they
enter
into
another
form
of
mentality
which
is
also
clearly
defined
the
revolutionary
mentality
in
all
ages
societies
have
contained
a
certain
number
of
restless
spirits
unstable
and
discontented
ready
to
rebel
against
any
established
order
of
affairs
they
are
actuated
by
the
mere
love
of
revolt
and
if
some
magic
power
could
realise
all
their
desires
they
would
simply
revolt
again
this
special
mentality
often
results
from
a
faulty
adaptation
of
the
individual
to
his
surroundings
or
from
an
excess
of
mysticism
but
it
may
also
be
merely
a
question
of
temperament
or
arise
from
pathological
disturbances
the
need
of
revolt
presents
very
different
degrees
of
intensity
from
simple
discontent
expressed
in
words
directed
against
men
and
things
to
the
need
of
destroying
them
sometimes
the
individual
turns
upon
himself
the
revolutionary
frenzy
that
he
can
not
otherwise
exercise
russia
is
full
of
these
madmen
who
not
content
with
committing
arson
or
throwing
bombs
at
hazard
into
the
crowd
finally
mutilate
themselves
like
the
skopzis
and
other
analogous
sects
these
perpetual
rebels
are
generally
highly
suggestible
beings
whose
mystic
mentality
is
obsessed
by
fixed
ideas
despite
the
apparent
energy
indicated
by
their
actions
they
are
really
weak
characters
and
are
incapable
of
mastering
themselves
sufficiently
to
resist
the
impulses
that
rule
them
the
mystic
spirit
which
animates
them
furnishes
pretexts
for
their
violence
and
enables
them
to
regard
themselves
as
great
reformers
in
normal
times
the
rebels
which
every
society
contains
are
restrained
by
the
laws
by
their
environment
in
short
by
all
the
usual
social
constraints
and
therefore
remain
undetected
but
as
soon
as
a
time
of
disturbance
begins
these
constraints
grow
weaker
and
the
rebel
can
give
a
free
reign
to
his
instincts
he
then
becomes
the
accredited
leader
of
a
movement
the
motive
of
the
revolution
matters
little
to
him
he
will
give
his
life
indifferently
for
the
red
flag
or
the
white
or
for
the
liberation
of
a
country
which
he
has
heard
vaguely
mentioned
the
revolutionary
spirit
is
not
always
pushed
to
the
extremes
which
render
it
dangerous
when
instead
of
deriving
from
affective
or
mystic
impulses
it
has
an
intellectual
origin
it
may
become
a
source
of
progress
it
is
thanks
to
those
spirits
who
are
sufficiently
independent
to
be
intellectually
revolutionary
that
a
civilisation
is
able
to
escape
from
the
yoke
of
tradition
and
habit
when
this
becomes
too
heavy
the
sciences
arts
and
industries
especially
have
progressed
by
the
aid
of
such
men
galileo
lavoisier
darwin
and
pasteur
were
such
revolutionaries
although
it
is
not
necessary
that
a
nation
should
possess
any
large
number
of
such
spirits
it
is
very
necessary
that
it
should
possess
some
without
them
men
would
still
be
living
in
caves
the
revolutionary
audacity
which
results
in
discoveries
implies
very
rare
faculties
it
necessitates
notably
an
independence
of
mind
sufficient
to
escape
from
the
influence
of
current
opinions
and
a
judgement
that
can
grasp
under
superficial
analogies
the
hidden
realities
this
form
of
revolutionary
spirit
is
creative
while
that
examined
above
is
destructive
the
revolutionary
mentality
may
therefore
be
compared
to
certain
physiological
states
in
the
life
of
the
individual
which
are
normally
useful
but
which
when
exaggerated
take
a
pathological
form
which
is
always
hurtful
the
criminal
mentality
all
the
civilised
societies
inevitably
drag
behind
them
a
residue
of
degenerates
of
the
unadapted
of
persons
affected
by
various
taints
vagabonds
beggars
fugitives
from
justice
thieves
assassins
and
starving
creatures
that
live
from
day
to
day
may
constitute
the
criminal
population
of
the
great
cities
in
ordinary
times
these
waste
products
of
civilisation
are
more
or
less
restrained
by
the
police
during
revolution
nothing
restrains
them
and
they
can
easily
gratify
their
instincts
to
murder
and
plunder
in
the
dregs
of
society
the
revolutionaries
of
all
times
are
sure
of
finding
recruits
eager
only
to
kill
and
to
plunder
little
matters
to
them
the
cause
they
are
sworn
to
defend
if
the
chances
of
murder
and
pillage
are
better
in
the
party
attacked
they
will
promptly
change
their
colours
to
these
criminals
properly
so
called
the
incurable
plague
of
all
societies
we
must
add
the
class
of
wrongdoers
on
occasion
they
never
rebel
so
long
as
the
fear
of
the
established
order
restrains
them
but
as
soon
as
it
weakens
they
enrol
themselves
in
the
army
of
revolution
these
two
categories
habitual
and
occasional
criminals
form
an
army
of
disorder
which
is
fit
for
nothing
but
the
creation
of
disorder
all
the
revolutionaries
all
the
founders
of
religious
or
political
leagues
have
constantly
counted
on
their
support
we
have
already
stated
that
this
population
with
its
criminal
mentality
exercised
a
considerable
influence
during
the
french
revolution
it
always
figured
in
the
front
rank
of
the
riots
which
occurred
almost
daily
certain
historians
have
spoken
with
respect
and
emotion
of
the
way
in
which
the
sovereign
people
enforced
its
will
upon
the
convention
invading
the
hall
armed
with
pikes
the
points
of
which
were
sometimes
decorated
with
newly
severed
heads
if
we
analyse
the
elements
composing
the
pretended
delegations
of
the
sovereign
people
we
shall
find
that
apart
from
a
small
number
of
simple
souls
who
submitted
to
the
impulses
of
the
leaders
the
mass
was
almost
entirely
formed
of
the
bandits
of
whom
i
have
been
speaking
to
them
were
due
the
innumerable
murders
of
which
the
massacres
of
september
and
the
killing
of
the
princesse
de
lamballe
were
merely
typical
they
terrorised
all
the
great
assemblies
from
the
constituent
assembly
to
the
convention
and
for
ten
years
they
helped
to
ravage
france
if
by
some
miracle
this
army
of
criminals
could
have
been
eliminated
the
progress
of
the
revolution
would
have
been
very
different
they
stained
it
with
blood
from
its
dawn
to
its
decline
reason
could
do
nothing
with
them
but
they
could
do
much
against
reason
chapter
iv
the
psychology
of
revolutionary
crowds
general
characteristics
of
the
crowd
whatever
their
origin
revolutions
do
not
produce
their
full
effects
until
they
have
penetrated
the
soul
of
the
multitude
they
therefore
represent
a
consequence
of
the
psychology
of
crowds
although
i
have
studied
collective
psychology
at
length
in
another
volume
i
must
here
recall
its
principal
laws
man
as
part
of
a
multitude
is
a
very
different
being
from
the
same
man
as
an
isolated
individual
his
conscious
individuality
vanishes
in
the
unconscious
personality
of
the
crowd
material
contact
is
not
absolutely
necessary
to
produce
in
the
individual
the
mentality
of
the
crowd
common
passions
and
sentiments
provoked
by
certain
events
are
often
sufficient
to
create
it
the
collective
mind
momentarily
formed
represents
a
very
special
kind
of
aggregate
its
chief
peculiarity
is
that
it
is
entirely
dominated
by
unconscious
elements
and
is
subject
to
a
peculiar
collective
logic
among
the
other
characteristics
of
crowds
we
must
note
their
infinite
credulity
and
exaggerated
sensibility
their
sightedness
and
their
incapacity
to
respond
to
the
influences
of
reason
affirmation
contagion
repetition
and
prestige
constitute
almost
the
only
means
of
persuading
them
reality
and
experience
have
no
effect
upon
them
the
multitude
will
admit
anything
nothing
is
impossible
in
the
eyes
of
the
crowd
by
reason
of
the
extreme
sensibility
of
crowds
their
sentiments
good
or
bad
are
always
exaggerated
this
exaggeration
increases
still
further
in
times
of
revolution
the
least
excitement
will
then
lead
the
multitude
to
act
with
the
utmost
fury
their
credulity
so
great
even
in
the
normal
state
is
still
further
increased
the
most
improbable
statements
are
accepted
arthur
young
relates
that
when
he
visited
the
springs
near
clermont
at
the
time
of
the
french
revolution
his
guide
was
stopped
by
the
people
who
were
persuaded
that
he
had
come
by
order
of
the
queen
to
mine
and
blow
up
the
town
the
most
horrible
tales
concerning
the
royal
family
were
circulated
depicting
it
as
a
nest
of
ghouls
and
vampires
these
various
characteristics
show
that
man
in
the
crowd
descends
to
a
very
low
degree
in
the
scale
of
civilisation
he
becomes
a
savage
with
all
a
savage
faults
and
qualities
with
all
his
momentary
violence
enthusiasm
and
heroism
in
the
intellectual
domain
a
crowd
is
always
inferior
to
the
isolated
unit
in
the
moral
and
sentimental
domain
it
may
be
his
superior
a
crowd
will
commit
a
crime
as
readily
as
an
act
of
abnegation
personal
characteristics
vanish
in
the
crowd
which
exerts
an
extraordinary
influence
upon
the
individuals
which
form
it
the
miser
becomes
generous
the
sceptic
a
believer
the
honest
man
a
criminal
the
coward
a
hero
examples
of
such
transformations
abounded
during
the
great
revolution
as
part
of
a
jury
or
a
parliament
the
collective
man
renders
verdicts
or
passes
laws
of
which
he
would
never
have
dreamed
in
his
isolated
condition
one
of
the
most
notable
consequences
of
the
influence
of
a
collectivity
upon
the
individuals
who
compose
it
is
the
unification
of
their
sentiments
and
wills
this
psychological
unity
confers
a
remarkable
force
upon
crowds
the
formation
of
such
a
mental
unity
results
chiefly
from
the
fact
that
in
a
crowd
gestures
and
actions
are
extremely
contagious
acclamations
of
hatred
fury
or
love
are
immediately
approved
and
repeated
what
is
the
origin
of
these
common
sentiments
this
common
will
they
are
propagated
by
contagion
but
a
point
of
departure
is
necessary
before
this
contagion
can
take
effect
without
a
leader
the
crowd
is
an
amorphous
entity
incapable
of
action
a
knowledge
of
the
laws
relating
to
the
psychology
of
crowds
is
indispensable
to
the
interpretation
of
the
elements
of
our
revolution
and
to
a
comprehension
of
the
conduct
of
revolutionary
assemblies
and
the
singular
transformations
of
the
individuals
who
form
part
of
them
pushed
by
the
unconscious
forces
of
the
collective
soul
they
more
often
than
not
say
what
they
did
not
intend
and
vote
what
they
would
not
have
wished
to
vote
although
the
laws
of
collective
psychology
have
sometimes
been
divined
instinctively
by
superior
statesmen
the
majority
of
governments
have
not
understood
and
do
not
understand
them
it
is
because
they
do
not
understand
them
that
so
many
of
them
have
fallen
so
easily
when
we
see
the
facility
with
which
certain
governments
were
overthrown
by
an
insignificant
riot
as
happened
in
the
case
of
the
monarchy
of
the
dangers
of
an
ignorance
of
collective
psychology
are
evident
the
marshal
in
command
of
the
troops
in
which
were
more
than
sufficient
to
defend
the
king
certainly
did
not
understand
that
the
moment
he
allowed
the
crowd
to
mingle
with
the
troops
the
latter
paralysed
by
suggestion
and
contagion
would
cease
to
do
their
duty
neither
did
he
know
that
as
the
multitude
is
extremely
sensible
to
prestige
it
needs
a
great
display
of
force
to
impress
it
and
that
such
a
display
will
at
once
suppress
hostile
demonstrations
he
was
equally
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
all
gatherings
should
be
dispersed
immediately
all
these
things
have
been
taught
by
experience
but
in
these
lessons
had
not
been
grasped
at
the
time
of
the
great
revolution
the
psychology
of
crowds
was
even
less
understood
how
the
stability
of
the
racial
mind
limits
the
oscillations
of
the
mind
of
the
crowd
a
people
can
in
a
sense
be
likened
to
a
crowd
it
possesses
certain
characteristics
but
the
oscillations
of
these
characteristics
are
limited
by
the
soul
or
mind
of
the
race
the
mind
of
the
race
has
a
fixity
unknown
to
the
transitory
mind
of
the
crowd
when
a
people
possesses
an
ancestral
soul
established
by
a
long
past
the
soul
of
the
crowd
is
always
dominated
thereby
a
people
differs
from
a
crowd
also
in
that
it
is
composed
of
a
collection
of
groups
each
having
different
interests
and
passions
in
a
crowd
properly
a
popular
assembly
for
example
there
are
unities
which
may
belong
to
very
different
social
categories
a
people
sometimes
seems
as
mobile
as
a
crowd
but
we
must
not
forget
that
behind
its
mobility
its
enthusiasms
its
violence
and
destructiveness
the
extremely
tenacious
and
conservative
instincts
of
the
racial
mind
persist
the
history
of
the
revolution
and
the
century
which
has
followed
shows
how
the
conservative
spirit
finally
overcomes
the
spirit
of
destruction
more
than
one
system
of
government
which
the
people
has
shattered
has
been
restored
by
the
people
it
is
not
as
easy
to
work
upon
the
mind
of
the
people
that
is
the
mind
of
the
race
as
on
the
mind
of
a
crowd
the
means
of
action
are
indirect
and
slower
journals
conferences
speeches
books
the
elements
of
persuasion
always
come
under
the
headings
already
given
affirmation
repetition
prestige
and
contagion
mental
contagion
may
affect
a
whole
people
instantaneously
but
more
often
it
operates
slowly
creeping
from
group
to
group
thus
was
the
reformation
propagated
in
france
a
people
is
far
less
excitable
than
a
crowd
but
certain
events
national
insults
threats
of
invasion
may
arouse
it
instantly
such
a
phenomenon
was
observed
on
several
occasions
during
the
revolution
notably
at
the
time
of
the
insolent
manifesto
issued
by
the
duke
of
brunswick
the
duke
knew
little
indeed
of
the
psychology
of
the
french
race
when
he
proffered
his
threats
not
only
did
he
considerably
prejudice
the
cause
of
louis
xvi
but
he
also
damaged
his
own
since
his
intervention
raised
from
the
soil
an
army
eager
to
fight
him
this
sudden
explosion
of
feeling
throughout
a
whole
race
has
been
observed
in
all
nations
napoleon
did
not
understand
the
power
of
such
explosions
when
he
invaded
spain
and
russia
one
may
easily
disaggregate
the
facile
mind
of
a
crowd
but
one
can
do
nothing
before
the
permanent
soul
of
a
race
certainly
the
russian
peasant
is
a
very
indifferent
being
gross
and
narrow
by
nature
yet
at
the
first
news
of
invasion
he
was
transformed
one
may
judge
of
this
fact
on
reading
a
letter
written
by
elizabeth
wife
of
the
emperor
alexander
i
from
the
moment
when
napoleon
had
crossed
our
frontiers
it
was
as
though
an
electric
spark
had
spread
through
all
russia
and
if
the
immensity
of
its
area
had
made
it
possible
for
the
news
to
penetrate
simultaneously
to
every
corner
of
the
empire
a
cry
of
indignation
would
have
arisen
so
terrible
that
i
believe
it
would
have
resounded
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
as
napoleon
advances
this
feeling
is
growing
yet
stronger
old
men
who
have
lost
all
or
nearly
all
their
goods
are
saying
shall
find
a
way
of
living
anything
is
preferable
to
a
shameful
peace
women
all
of
whose
kin
are
in
the
army
regard
the
dangers
they
are
running
as
secondary
and
fear
nothing
but
peace
happily
this
peace
which
would
be
the
of
russia
will
not
be
negotiated
the
emperor
does
not
conceive
of
such
an
idea
and
even
if
he
would
he
could
not
this
is
the
heroic
side
of
our
position
the
empress
describes
to
her
mother
the
two
following
traits
which
give
some
idea
of
the
degree
of
resistance
of
which
the
soul
of
the
russian
is
capable
the
frenchmen
had
caught
some
unhappy
peasants
in
moscow
whom
they
thought
to
force
to
serve
in
their
ranks
and
in
order
that
they
should
not
be
able
to
escape
they
branded
their
hands
as
one
brands
horses
in
the
stud
one
of
them
asked
what
this
mark
meant
he
was
told
it
signified
that
he
was
a
french
soldier
i
am
a
soldier
of
the
emperor
of
the
french
he
said
and
immediately
he
took
his
hatchet
cut
off
his
hand
and
threw
it
at
the
feet
of
those
present
saying
it
there
your
mark
at
moscow
too
the
french
had
taken
a
score
of
peasants
of
whom
they
wished
to
make
an
example
in
order
to
frighten
the
villagers
who
were
picking
off
the
french
foraging
parties
and
were
making
war
as
well
as
the
detachments
of
regular
troops
they
ranged
them
against
a
wall
and
read
their
sentence
in
russian
they
waited
for
them
to
beg
for
mercy
instead
of
that
they
took
farewell
of
one
another
and
made
their
sign
of
the
cross
the
french
fired
on
the
first
of
them
they
waited
for
the
rest
to
beg
for
pardon
in
their
terror
and
to
promise
to
change
their
conduct
they
fired
on
the
second
and
on
the
third
and
so
on
all
the
twenty
without
a
single
one
having
attempted
to
implore
the
clemency
of
the
enemy
napoleon
has
not
once
had
the
pleasure
of
profaning
this
word
in
russia
among
the
characteristics
of
the
popular
mind
we
must
mention
that
in
all
peoples
and
all
ages
it
has
been
saturated
with
mysticism
the
people
will
always
be
convinced
that
superior
beings
divinities
governments
or
great
men
have
the
power
to
change
things
at
will
this
mystic
side
produces
an
intense
need
of
adoration
the
people
must
have
a
fetich
either
a
man
or
a
doctrine
this
is
why
when
threatened
with
anarchy
it
calls
for
a
messiah
to
save
it
like
the
crowd
but
more
slowly
the
people
readily
passes
from
adoration
to
hatred
a
man
may
be
the
hero
of
the
people
at
one
period
and
finally
earn
its
curses
these
variations
of
popular
opinion
concerning
political
personalities
may
be
observed
in
all
times
the
history
of
cromwell
furnishes
us
with
a
very
curious
example
after
having
overthrown
a
dynasty
and
refused
a
crown
he
was
buried
like
a
king
among
kings
two
years
later
his
body
was
torn
from
the
tomb
and
his
head
cut
off
by
the
executioner
was
exposed
above
the
gate
of
the
house
of
parliament
a
little
while
ago
a
statue
was
raised
to
him
the
old
anarchist
turned
autocrat
now
figures
in
the

the
role
of
the
leader
in
revolutionary
movements
all
the
varieties
of
crowds
homogeneous
and
heterogeneous
assemblies
peoples
clubs
are
as
we
have
often
repeated
aggregates
incapable
of
unity
and
action
so
long
as
they
find
no
master
to
lead
them
i
have
shown
elsewhere
making
use
of
certain
physiological
experiments
that
the
unconscious
collective
mind
of
the
crowd
seems
bound
up
with
the
mind
of
the
leader
the
latter
gives
it
a
single
will
and
imposes
absolute
obedience
the
leader
acts
especially
through
suggestion
his
success
depends
on
his
fashion
of
provoking
this
suggestion
many
experiments
have
shown
to
what
point
a
collectivity
may
be
subjected
to
suggestion
among
the
numerous
experiments
made
to
prove
this
fact
one
of
the
most
remarkable
was
performed
on
the
pupils
of
his
class
by
professor
glosson
and
published
in
the
revue
scientifique
for
october
i
prepared
a
bottle
filled
with
distilled
water
carefully
wrapped
in
cotton
and
packed
in
a
box
after
several
other
experiments
i
stated
that
i
wished
to
measure
the
rapidity
with
which
an
odour
would
diffuse
itself
through
the
air
and
asked
those
present
to
raise
their
hands
the
moment
they
perceived
the
odour
i
took
out
the
bottle
and
poured
the
water
on
the
cotton
turning
my
head
away
during
the
operation
then
took
up
a
and
awaited
the
result
i
explained
that
i
was
absolutely
sure
that
no
one
present
had
ever
smelt
the
odour
of
the
chemical
composition
i
had
spilt
at
the
end
of
fifteen
seconds
the
majority
of
those
in
front
had
held
up
their
hands
and
in
forty
seconds
the
odour
had
reached
the
back
of
the
hall
by
fairly
regular
waves
about
of
those
present
declared
that
they
perceived
the
odour
a
larger
number
would
doubtless
have
succumbed
to
suggestion
if
at
the
end
of
a
minute
i
had
not
been
forced
to
stop
the
experiment
some
of
those
in
the
front
rows
being
unpleasantly
affected
by
the
odour
and
wishing
to
leave
the
hall
according
to
the
suggestions
of
the
leaders
the
multitude
will
be
calm
furious
criminal
or
heroic
these
various
suggestions
may
sometimes
appear
to
present
a
rational
aspect
but
they
will
only
appear
to
be
reasonable
a
crowd
is
in
reality
inaccessible
to
reason
the
only
ideas
capable
of
influencing
it
will
always
be
sentiments
evoked
in
the
form
of
images
the
history
of
the
revolution
shows
on
every
page
how
easily
the
multitude
follows
the
most
contradictory
impulses
given
by
its
different
leaders
we
see
it
applaud
just
as
vigorously
at
the
triumph
of
the
girondists
the
hebertists
the
dantonists
and
the
terrorists
as
at
their
successive
downfalls
one
may
be
quite
sure
also
that
the
crowd
understood
nothing
of
these
events
at
a
distance
one
can
only
confusedly
perceive
the
part
played
by
the
leaders
for
they
commonly
work
in
the
shade
to
grasp
this
clearly
we
must
study
them
in
contemporary
events
we
shall
then
see
how
readily
the
leader
can
provoke
the
most
violent
popular
movements
we
are
not
thinking
here
of
the
strikes
of
the
postmen
or
railway
men
in
which
the
discontent
of
the
employees
might
intervene
but
of
events
in
which
the
crowd
was
not
in
the
least
interested
such
for
example
was
the
popular
rising
provoked
by
a
few
socialist
leaders
amidst
the
parisian
populace
on
the
morrow
of
the
execution
of
ferrer
in
spain
the
french
crowd
had
never
heard
of
ferrer
in
spain
his
execution
was
almost
unnoticed
in
paris
the
incitements
of
a
few
leaders
sufficed
to
hurl
a
regular
popular
army
upon
the
spanish
embassy
with
the
intention
of
burning
it
part
of
the
garrison
had
to
be
employed
to
protect
it
energetically
repulsed
the
assailants
contented
themselves
with
sacking
a
few
shops
and
building
some
barricades
at
the
same
time
the
leaders
gave
another
proof
of
their
influence
finally
understanding
that
the
burning
of
a
foreign
embassy
might
be
extremely
dangerous
they
ordered
a
pacific
demonstration
for
the
following
day
and
were
as
faithfully
obeyed
as
if
they
had
ordered
the
most
violent
riot
no
example
could
better
show
the
importance
of
leaders
and
the
submission
of
the
crowd
the
historians
who
from
michelet
to
aulard
have
represented
the
revolutionary
crowd
as
having
acted
on
its
own
initiative
without
leaders
do
not
comprehend
its
psychology
chapter
v
the
psychology
of
the
revolutionary
assemblies
psychological
characteristics
of
the
great
revolutionary
assemblies
a
great
political
assembly
a
parliament
for
example
is
a
crowd
but
a
crowd
which
sometimes
fails
in
effectual
action
on
account
of
the
contrary
sentiments
of
the
hostile
groups
composing
it
the
presence
of
these
groups
actuated
by
different
interests
must
make
us
consider
an
assembly
as
formed
of
superimposed
and
heterogeneous
crowds
each
obeying
its
particular
leaders
the
law
of
the
mental
unity
of
crowds
is
manifested
only
in
each
group
and
it
is
only
as
a
result
of
exceptional
circumstances
that
the
different
groups
act
with
a
single
intention
each
group
in
an
assembly
represents
a
single
being
the
individuals
contributing
to
the
formation
of
this
being
are
no
longer
themselves
and
will
unhesitatingly
vote
against
their
convictions
and
their
wishes
on
the
eve
of
the
day
when
louis
xvi
was
to
be
condemned
vergniaud
protested
with
indignation
against
the
suggestion
that
he
should
vote
for
his
death
but
he
did
so
vote
on
the
following
day
the
action
of
a
group
consists
chiefly
in
fortifying
hesitating
opinions
all
feeble
individual
convictions
become
confirmed
upon
becoming
collective
leaders
of
great
repute
or
unusual
violence
can
sometimes
by
acting
on
all
the
groups
of
an
assembly
make
them
a
single
crowd
the
majority
of
the
members
of
the
convention
enacted
measures
entirely
contrary
to
their
opinions
under
the
influence
of
a
very
small
number
of
such
leaders
collectivities
have
always
given
way
before
active
sectaries
the
history
of
the
revolutionary
assemblies
shows
how
pusillanimous
they
were
despite
the
boldness
of
their
language
respecting
kings
before
the
leaders
of
the
popular
riots
the
invasion
of
a
band
of
energumens
commanded
by
an
imperious
leader
was
enough
to
make
them
vote
then
and
there
the
most
absurd
and
contradictory
measures
an
assembly
having
the
characteristics
of
a
crowd
will
like
a
crowd
be
extreme
in
its
sentiments
excessive
in
its
violence
it
will
be
excessive
in
its
cowardice
in
general
it
will
be
insolent
to
the
weak
and
servile
before
the
strong
we
remember
the
fearful
humility
of
the
parliament
when
the
youthful
louis
xiv
entered
whip
in
hand
to
pronounce
his
brief
speech
we
know
with
what
increasing
impertinence
the
constituent
assembly
treated
louis
xvi
as
it
felt
that
he
was
becoming
defenceless
finally
we
recall
the
terror
of
the
convention
under
the
reign
of
robespierre
this
characteristic
of
assemblies
being
a
general
law
the
convocation
of
an
assembly
by
a
sovereign
when
his
power
is
failing
must
be
regarded
as
a
gross
error
in
psychology
the
assembling
of
the
states
general
cost
the
life
of
louis
xvi
it
all
but
lost
henry
iii
his
throne
when
obliged
to
leave
paris
he
had
the
unhappy
idea
of
assembling
the
estates
at
blois
conscious
of
the
weakness
of
the
king
the
estates
at
once
spoke
as
masters
of
the
situation
modifying
taxes
dismissing
officials
and
claiming
that
their
decisions
should
have
the
force
of
law
this
progressive
exaggeration
of
sentiments
was
plainly
demonstrated
in
all
the
assemblies
of
the
revolution
the
constituent
assembly
at
first
extremely
respectful
toward
the
royal
authority
and
its
prerogatives
finally
proclaimed
itself
a
sovereign
assembly
and
treated
louis
xvi
as
a
mere
official
the
convention
after
relatively
moderate
beginnings
ended
with
a
preliminary
form
of
the
terror
when
judgments
were
still
surrounded
by
certain
legal
guarantees
then
quickly
increasing
its
powers
it
enacted
a
law
depriving
all
accused
persons
of
the
right
of
defence
permitting
their
condemnation
upon
the
mere
suspicion
of
being
suspect
yielding
more
and
more
to
its
sanguinary
frenzy
it
finally
decimated
itself
girondists
hebertists
dantonists
and
robespierrists
successively
ended
their
careers
at
the
hands
of
the
executioner
this
exaggeration
of
the
sentiments
of
assemblies
explains
why
they
were
always
so
little
able
to
control
their
own
destinies
and
why
they
so
often
arrived
at
conclusions
exactly
contrary
to
the
ends
proposed
catholic
and
royalist
the
constituent
assembly
instead
of
the
constitutional
monarchy
it
wished
to
establish
and
the
religion
it
wished
to
defend
rapidly
led
france
to
a
violent
republic
and
the
persecution
of
the
clergy
political
assemblies
are
composed
as
we
have
seen
of
heterogeneous
groups
but
they
have
sometimes
been
formed
of
homogeneous
groups
as
for
instance
certain
of
the
clubs
which
played
so
enormous
a
part
during
the
revolution
and
whose
psychology
deserves
a
special
examination
the
psychology
of
the
revolutionary
clubs
small
assemblies
of
men
possessing
the
same
opinions
the
same
beliefs
and
the
same
interests
which
eliminate
all
dissentient
voices
differ
from
the
great
assemblies
by
the
unity
of
their
sentiments
and
therefore
their
wills
such
were
the
communes
the
religious
congregations
the
corporations
and
the
clubs
during
the
revolution
the
secret
societies
during
the
first
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
and
the
freemasons
and
syndicalists
of
the
points
of
difference
between
a
heterogeneous
assembly
and
a
homogeneous
club
must
be
thoroughly
grasped
if
we
are
to
comprehend
the
progress
of
the
french
revolution
until
the
directory
and
especially
during
the
convention
the
revolution
was
directed
by
the
clubs
despite
the
unity
of
will
due
to
the
absence
of
dissident
parties
the
clubs
obey
the
laws
of
the
psychology
of
crowds
they
are
consequently
subjugated
by
leaders
this
we
see
especially
in
the
jacobin
club
which
was
dominated
by
robespierre
the
function
of
the
leader
of
a
club
a
homogeneous
crowd
is
far
more
difficult
than
that
of
a
leader
of
a
heterogeneous
crowd
the
latter
may
easily
be
led
by
harping
on
a
small
number
of
strings
but
in
a
homogeneous
group
like
a
club
whose
sentiments
and
interests
are
identical
the
leader
must
know
how
to
humour
them
and
is
often
himself
led
part
of
the
strength
of
homogeneous
agglomerations
resides
in
their
anonymity
we
know
that
during
the
commune
of
a
few
anonymous
orders
sufficed
to
effect
the
burning
of
the
finest
monuments
of
paris
the
hotel
de
ville
the
tuileries
the
cour
des
comptes
the
buildings
of
the
legion
of
honour
a
brief
order
from
the
anonymous
committees
burn
finances
burn
tuileries
was
immediately
executed
an
chance
only
saved
the
louvre
and
its
collections
we
know
too
what
religious
attention
is
in
our
days
accorded
to
the
most
absurd
injunctions
of
the
anonymous
leaders
of
the
trades
unions
the
clubs
of
paris
and
the
insurrectionary
commune
were
not
less
scrupulously
obeyed
at
the
time
of
the
revolution
an
order
emanating
from
these
was
sufficient
to
hurl
upon
the
assembly
a
popular
army
which
dictated
its
wishes
summing
up
the
history
of
the
convention
in
another
chapter
we
shall
see
how
frequent
were
these
irruptions
and
with
what
servility
the
assembly
which
according
to
the
legends
was
so
powerful
bowed
itself
before
the
most
imperative
injunctions
of
a
handful
of
rioters
instructed
by
experience
the
directory
closed
the
clubs
and
put
an
end
to
the
invasion
of
the
populace
by
energetically
shooting
them
down
the
convention
had
early
grasped
the
superiority
of
homogeneous
groups
over
heterogeneous
assemblies
in
matters
of
government
which
is
why
it
subdivided
itself
into
committees
composed
each
of
a
limited
number
of
individuals
these
committees
of
public
safety
of
finance
formed
small
sovereign
assemblies
in
the
midst
of
the
larger
assembly
their
power
was
held
in
check
only
by
that
of
the
clubs
the
preceding
considerations
show
the
power
of
groups
over
the
wills
of
the
members
composing
them
if
the
group
is
homogeneous
this
action
is
considerable
if
it
is
heterogeneous
it
is
less
considerable
but
may
still
become
important
either
because
the
more
powerful
groups
of
an
assembly
will
dominate
those
whose
cohesion
is
weaker
or
because
certain
contagious
sentiments
will
often
extend
themselves
to
all
the
members
of
an
assembly
a
memorable
example
of
this
influence
of
groups
occurred
at
the
time
of
the
revolution
when
on
the
night
of
the
of
august
the
nobles
voted
on
the
proposition
of
one
of
their
members
the
abandonment
of
feudal
privileges
yet
we
know
that
the
revolution
resulted
in
part
from
the
refusal
of
the
clergy
and
the
nobles
to
renounce
their
privileges
why
did
they
refuse
to
renounce
them
at
first
simply
because
men
in
a
crowd
do
not
act
as
the
same
men
singly
individually
no
member
of
the
nobility
would
ever
have
abandoned
his
rights
of
this
influence
of
assemblies
upon
their
members
napoleon
at
helena
cited
some
curious
examples
nothing
was
more
common
than
to
meet
with
men
at
this
period
quite
unlike
the
reputation
that
their
acts
and
words
would
seem
to
justify
for
instance
one
might
have
supposed
monge
to
be
a
terrible
fellow
when
war
was
decided
upon
he
mounted
the
tribune
of
the
jacobins
and
declared
that
he
would
give
his
two
daughters
to
the
two
first
soldiers
to
be
wounded
by
the
enemy
he
wanted
the
nobles
to
be
killed
now
monge
was
the
most
gentle
and
feeble
of
men
and
would
have
had
a
chicken
killed
if
he
had
had
to
do
it
with
his
own
hands
or
even
to
have
it
done
in
his
presence
a
suggested
explanation
of
the
progressive
exaggeration
of
sentiments
in
assemblies
if
collective
sentiments
were
susceptible
of
exact
quantitative
measurement
we
might
translate
them
by
a
curve
which
after
a
first
gradual
ascent
runs
upward
with
extreme
rapidity
and
then
falls
almost
vertically
the
equation
of
this
curve
might
be
called
the
equation
of
the
variations
of
collective
sentiments
subjected
to
a
constant
excitation
it
is
not
always
easy
to
explain
the
acceleration
of
certain
sentiments
under
the
influence
of
a
constant
exciting
cause
perhaps
however
one
may
say
that
if
the
laws
of
psychology
are
comparable
to
those
of
mechanics
a
cause
of
invariable
dimensions
acting
in
a
continuous
fashion
will
rapidly
increase
the
intensity
of
a
sentiment
we
know
for
example
that
a
force
which
is
constant
in
dimension
and
direction
such
as
gravity
acting
upon
a
mass
will
cause
an
accelerated
movement
the
speed
of
a
free
object
falling
in
space
under
the
influence
of
gravity
will
be
about
feet
during
the
first
second
feet
during
the
next
feet
during
the
next
it
would
be
easy
were
the
moving
body
allowed
to
fall
from
a
sufficient
height
to
give
it
a
velocity
sufficient
to
perforate
a
plate
of
steel
but
although
this
explanation
is
applicable
to
the
acceleration
of
a
sentiment
subjected
to
a
constant
exciting
cause
it
does
not
tell
us
why
the
effects
of
acceleration
finally
and
suddenly
cease
such
a
fall
is
only
comprehensible
if
we
bring
in
physiological
factors
that
is
if
we
remember
that
pleasure
like
pain
can
not
exceed
certain
limits
and
that
all
sensations
when
too
violent
result
in
the
paralysis
of
sensation
our
organism
can
only
support
a
certain
maximum
of
joy
pain
or
effort
and
it
can
not
support
that
maximum
for
long
together
the
hand
which
grasps
a
dynamometer
soon
exhausts
its
effort
and
is
obliged
suddenly
to
let
go
the
study
of
the
causes
of
the
rapid
disappearance
of
certain
groups
of
sentiments
in
assemblies
will
remind
us
of
the
fact
that
beside
the
party
which
is
predominant
by
means
of
its
strength
or
prestige
there
are
others
whose
sentiments
restrained
by
this
force
or
prestige
have
not
reached
their
full
development
some
chance
circumstance
may
somewhat
weaken
the
prevailing
party
when
immediately
the
suppressed
sentiments
of
the
adverse
parties
may
become
preponderant
the
mountain
learned
this
lesson
after
thermidor

analogies
that
we
may
seek
to
establish
between
the
laws
of
material
phenomena
and
those
which
condition
the
evolution

and
mystic
factors
are
evidently
extremely
rough

concerning
the
french
revolution
the
historians
of
the
revolution
the
most
contradictory
opinions
have
been
expressed
respecting
the
french
revolution
and
although
only
a
century
separates
us
from
the
period
in
question
it
seems
impossible
as
yet
to
judge
it
calmly
for
de
maistre
it
was
a
satanic
piece
of
work
and
never
was
the
action
of
the
spirit
of
darkness
so
evidently
manifested
for
the
modern
jacobins
it
has
regenerated
the
human
race
foreigners
who
live
in
france
still
regard
it
as
a
subject
to
be
avoided
in
conversation
everywhere
writes
barrett
wendell
this
memory
and
these
traditions
are
still
endowed
with
such
vitality
that
few
persons
are
capable
of
considering
them
dispassionately
they
still
excite
both
enthusiasm
and
resentment
they
are
still
regarded
with
a
loyal
and
ardent
spirit
of
partisanship
the
better
you
come
to
understand
france
the
more
clearly
you
see
that
even
day
no
study
of
the
revolution
strikes
any
frenchman
as
having
been
impartial
this
observation
is
perfectly
correct
to
be
interpretable
with
equity
the
events
of
the
past
must
no
longer
be
productive
of
results
and
must
not
touch
the
religious
or
political
beliefs
whose
inevitable
intolerance
i
have
denoted
we
must
not
therefore
be
surprised
that
historians
express
very
different
ideas
respecting
the
revolution
for
a
long
time
to
come
some
will
still
see
in
it
one
of
the
most
sinister
events
of
history
while
to
others
it
will
remain
one
of
the
most
glorious
all
writers
on
the
subject
have
believed
that
they
have
related
its
course
with
impartiality
but
in
general
they
have
merely
supported
contradictory
theories
of
peculiar
simplicity
the
documents
being
innumerable
and
contradictory
their
conscious
or
unconscious
choice
has
readily
enabled
them
to
justify
their
respective
theories
the
older
historians
of
the
revolution
thiers
quinet
and
despite
his
talent
michelet
himself
are
somewhat
eclipsed
day
their
doctrines
were
by
no
means
complicated
a
historic
fatalism
prevails
generally
in
their
work
thiers
regarded
the
revolution
as
the
result
of
several
centuries
of
absolute
monarchy
and
the
terror
as
the
necessary
consequence
of
foreign
invasion
quinet
described
the
excesses
of
as
the
result
of
a
despotism
but
declared
that
the
tyranny
of
the
convention
was
unnecessary
and
hampered
the
work
of
the
revolution
michelet
saw
in
this
last
merely
the
work
of
the
people
whom
he
blindly
admired
and
commenced
the
glorification
continued
by
other
historians
the
former
reputation
of
all
these
historians
has
been
to
a
great
extent
effaced
by
that
of
taine
although
equally
impassioned
he
threw
a
brilliant
light
upon
the
revolutionary
period
and
it
will
doubtless
be
long
before
his
work
is
superseded
work
so
important
is
bound
to
show
faults
taine
is
admirable
in
the
representation
of
facts
and
persons
but
he
attempts
to
judge
by
the
standard
of
rational
logic
events
which
were
not
dictated
by
reason
and
which
therefore
he
can
not
interpret
his
psychology
excellent
when
it
is
merely
descriptive
is
very
weak
as
soon
as
it
becomes
explanatory
to
affirm
that
robespierre
was
a
pedantic
swotter
is
not
to
reveal
the
causes
of
his
absolute
power
over
the
convention
at
a
time
when
he
had
spent
several
months
in
decimating
it
with
perfect
impunity
it
has
very
justly
been
said
of
taine
that
he
saw
well
and
understood
little
despite
these
restrictions
his
work
is
highly
remarkable
and
has
not
been
equalled
we
may
judge
of
his
immense
influence
by
the
exasperation
which
he
causes
among
the
faithful
defenders
of
jacobin
orthodoxy
of
which
aulard
professor
at
the
sorbonne
is
the
high
priest
the
latter
has
devoted
two
years
to
writing
a
pamphlet
against
taine
every
line
of
which
is
steeped
in
passion
all
this
time
spent
in
rectifying
a
few
material
errors
which
are
not
really
significant
has
only
resulted
in
the
perpetration
of
the
very
same
errors
reviewing
his
work
cochin
shows
that
aulard
has
at
least
on
every
other
occasion
been
deceived
by
his
quotations
whereas
taine
erred
far
more
rarely
the
same
historian
shows
also
that
we
must
not
trust
aulard
sources
these
sources
proceedings
pamphlets
journals
and
the
speeches
and
writings
of
patriots
are
precisely
the
authentic
publications
of
patriotism
edited
by
patriots
and
edited
as
a
rule
for
the
benefit
of
the
public
he
ought
to
have
seen
in
all
this
simply
the
special
pleading
of
the
defendant
he
had
before
his
eyes
a
history
of
the
revolution
which
presents
side
by
side
with
each
of
the
acts
of
the
from
the
massacres
of
september
to
the
law
of
prairial
a
made
explanation
according
to
the
republican
system
of
defence
perhaps
the
fairest
criticism
that
one
can
make
of
the
work
of
taine
is
that
it
was
left
incomplete
he
studied
more
especially
the
role
of
the
populace
and
its
leaders
during
the
revolutionary
period
this
inspired
him
with
pages
vibrating
with
an
indignation
which
we
can
still
admire
but
several
important
aspects
of
the
revolution
escaped
him
whatever
one
may
think
of
the
revolution
an
irreducible
difference
will
always
exist
between
historians
of
the
school
of
taine
and
those
of
the
school
of
aulard
the
latter
regards
the
sovereign
people
as
admirable
while
the
former
shows
us
that
when
abandoned
to
its
instincts
and
liberated
from
all
social
restraint
it
relapses
into
primitive
savagery
the
conception
of
aulard
entirely
contrary
to
the
lessons
of
the
psychology
of
crowds
is
none
the
less
a
religious
dogma
in
the
eyes
of
modern
jacobins
they
write
of
the
revolution
according
to
the
methods
of
believers
and
take
for
learned
works
the
arguments
of
virtual
theologians
the
theory
of
fatalism
in
respect
of
the
revolution
advocates
and
detractors
of
the
revolution
often
admit
the
fatality
of
revolutionary
events
this
theory
is
well
synthetised
in
the
following
passage
from
the
history
of
the
revolution
by
emile
olivier
no
man
could
oppose
it
the
blame
belongs
neither
to
those
who
perished
nor
to
those
who
survived
there
was
no
individual
force
capable
of
changing
the
elements
and
of
foreseeing
the
events
which
were
born
of
the
nature
of
things
and
circumstances
taine
himself
inclines
to
this
idea
at
the
moment
when
the
states
general
were
opened
the
course
of
ideas
and
events
was
not
only
determined
but
even
visible
each
generation
unwittingly
bears
within
itself
its
future
and
its
past
from
the
latter
its
destinies
might
have
been
foretold
long
before
the
issue
other
modern
authors
who
profess
no
more
indulgence
for
the
violence
of
the
revolutionaries
than
did
taine
are
equally
convinced
of
this
fatality
sorel
after
recalling
the
saying
of
bossuet
concerning
the
revolutions
of
antiquity
everything
is
surprising
if
we
only
consider
particular
causes
and
yet
everything
goes
forward
in
regular
sequence
expresses
an
intention
which
he
very
imperfectly
realises
to
show
in
the
revolution
which
seems
to
some
the
subversion
and
to
others
the
regeneration
of
the
old
european
world
the
natural
and
necessary
result
of
the
history
of
europe
and
to
show
moreover
that
this
revolution
had
no
result
not
even
the
most
unexpected
that
did
not
ensue
from
this
history
and
was
not
explained
by
the
precedents
of
the
ancien
regime
guizot
also
had
formerly
attempted
to
prove
that
our
revolution
which
he
quite
wrongly
compared
to
that
of
england
was
perfectly
natural
and
effected
no
innovations
far
from
having
broken
with
the
natural
course
of
events
in
europe
neither
the
english
revolution
nor
our
own
did
intended
or
said
anything
that
had
not
been
said
intended
and
done
a
hundred
years
before
its
outbreak
whether
we
regard
the
general
doctrines
of
the
two
revolutions
or
the
application
made
of
them
whether
we
deal
with
the
government
of
the
state
or
with
the
civil
legislation
with
property
or
with
persons
with
liberty
or
with
power
we
shall
find
nothing
of
which
the
invention
can
be
attributed
to
them
nothing
that
will
not
be
encountered
elsewhere
or
that
was
not
at
least
originated
in
times
which
we
qualify
as
normal
all
these
assertions
merely
recall
the
banal
law
that
a
phenomenon
is
simply
the
consequence
of
previous
phenomena
such
very
general
propositions
do
not
teach
us
much
we
must
not
try
to
explain
too
many
events
by
the
principle
of
fatality
adopted
by
so
many
historians
i
have
elsewhere
discussed
the
significance
of
such
fatalities
and
have
shown
that
the
whole
effort
of
civilisation
consists
in
trying
to
escape
therefrom
certainly
history
is
full
of
necessities
but
it
is
also
full
of
contingent
facts
which
were
and
might
not
have
been
napoleon
himself
on
helena
enumerated
six
circumstances
which
might
have
checked
his
prodigious
career
he
related
notably
that
on
taking
a
bath
at
auxonne
in
he
only
escaped
death
by
the
fortuitous
presence
of
a
sandbank
if
bonaparte
had
died
then
we
may
admit
that
another
general
would
have
arisen
and
might
have
become
dictator
but
what
would
have
become
of
the
imperial
epic
and
its
consequences
without
the
man
of
genius
who
led
our
victorious
armies
into
all
the
capitals
of
europe
it
is
permissible
to
consider
the
revolution
as
being
partly
a
necessity
but
it
was
above
all
which
is
what
the
fatalistic
writers
already
cited
do
not
show
us
a
permanent
struggle
between
theorists
who
were
imbued
with
a
new
ideal
and
the
economic
social
and
political
laws
which
ruled
mankind
and
which
they
did
not
understand
not
understanding
them
they
sought
in
vain
to
direct
the
course
of
events
were
exasperated
at
their
failure
and
finally
committed
every
species
of
violence
they
decreed
that
the
paper
money
known
as
assignats
should
be
accepted
as
the
equivalent
of
gold
and
all
their
threats
could
not
prevent
the
fictitious
value
of
such
money
falling
almost
to
nothing
they
decreed
the
law
of
the
maximum
and
it
merely
increased
the
evils
it
was
intended
to
remedy
robespierre
declared
before
the
convention
that
all
the
culottes
will
be
paid
at
the
expense
of
the
public
treasury
which
will
be
fed
by
the
rich
and
in
spite
of
requisitions
and
the
guillotine
the
treasury
remained
empty
having
broken
all
human
restraints
the
men
of
the
revolution
finally
discovered
that
a
society
can
not
live
without
them
but
when
they
sought
to
create
them
anew
they
saw
that
even
the
strongest
society
though
supported
by
the
fear
of
the
guillotine
could
not
replace
the
discipline
which
the
past
had
slowly
built
up
in
the
minds
of
men
as
for
understanding
the
evolution
of
society
or
judging
men
hearts
and
minds
or
foreseeing
the
consequences
of
the
laws
they
enacted
they
scarcely
attempted
to
do
so
the
events
of
the
revolution
did
not
ensue
from
irreducible
necessities
they
were
far
more
the
consequence
of
jacobin
principles
than
of
circumstances
and
might
have
been
quite
other
than
they
were
would
the
revolution
have
followed
the
same
path
if
louis
xvi
had
been
better
advised
or
if
the
constituent
assembly
had
been
less
cowardly
in
times
of
popular
insurrection
the
theory
of
revolutionary
fatality
is
only
useful
to
justify
violence
by
presenting
it
as
inevitable
whether
we
are
dealing
with
science
or
with
history
we
must
beware
of
the
ignorance
which
takes
shelter
under
the
shibboleth
of
fatalism
nature
was
formerly
full
of
a
host
of
fatalities
which
science
is
slowly
contriving
to
avoid
the
function
of
the
superior
man
is
as
i
have
shown
elsewhere
to
avert
such
fatalities
the
hesitations
of
recent
historians
of
the
revolution
the
historians
whose
ideas
we
have
examined
in
the
preceding
chapter
were
extremely
positive
in
their
special
pleading
confined
within
the
limits
of
belief
they
did
not
attempt
to
penetrate
the
domain
of
knowledge
a
monarchical
writer
was
violently
hostile
to
the
revolution
and
a
liberal
writer
was
its
violent
apologist
at
the
present
time
we
can
see
the
commencement
of
a
movement
which
will
surely
lead
to
the
study
of
the
revolution
as
one
of
those
scientific
phenomena
into
which
the
opinions
and
beliefs
of
a
writer
enter
so
little
that
the
reader
does
not
even
suspect
them
this
period
has
not
yet
come
into
being
we
are
still
in
the
period
of
doubt
the
liberal
writers
who
used
to
be
so
positive
are
now
so
no
longer
one
may
judge
of
this
new
state
of
mind
by
the
following
extracts
from
recent
authors
hanotaux
having
vaunted
the
utility
of
the
revolution
asks
whether
its
results
were
not
bought
too
dearly
and
adds
history
hesitates
and
will
for
a
long
time
yet
hesitate
to
answer
madelin
is
equally
dubious
in
the
book
he
has
recently
published
i
have
never
felt
sufficient
authority
to
form
even
in
my
inmost
conscience
a
categorical
judgment
on
so
complex
a
phenomenon
as
the
french
revolution
i
find
it
even
more
difficult
to
form
a
brief
judgement
causes
facts
and
consequences
seem
to
me
to
be
still
extremely
debatable
subjects
one
may
obtain
a
still
better
idea
of
the
transformation
of
the
old
ideas
concerning
the
revolution
by
perusing
the
latest
writings
of
its
official
defenders
while
they
professed
formerly
to
justify
every
act
of
violence
by
representing
it
as
a
simple
act
of
defence
they
now
confine
themselves
to
pleading
extenuating
circumstances
i
find
a
striking
proof
of
this
new
frame
of
mind
in
the
history
of
france
for
the
use
of
schools
published
by
mm
aulard
and
debidour
concerning
the
terror
we
read
the
following
lines
blood
flowed
in
waves
there
were
acts
of
injustice
and
crimes
which
were
useless
from
the
point
of
view
of
national
defence
and
odious
but
men
had
lost
their
heads
in
the
tempest
and
harassed
by
a
thousand
dangers
the
patriots
struck
out
in
their
rage
we
shall
see
in
another
part
of
this
work
that
the
first
of
the
two
authors
whom
i
have
cited
is
in
spite
of
his
uncompromising
jacobinism
by
no
means
indulgent
toward
the
men
formerly
qualified
as
the
giants
of
the
convention
the
judgments
of
foreigners
upon
our
revolution
are
usually
distinctly
severe
and
we
can
not
be
surprised
when
we
remember
how
europe
suffered
during
the
twenty
years
of
upheaval
in
france
the
germans
in
particular
have
been
most
severe
their
opinion
is
summed
up
in
the
following
lines
by
faguet
let
us
say
it
courageously
and
patriotically
for
patriotism
consists
above
all
in
telling
the
truth
to
one
own
country
germany
sees
in
france
with
regard
to
the
past
a
people
who
with
the
great
words
and
in
its
mouth
oppressed
trampled
murdered
pillaged
and
fleeced
her
for
fifteen
years
and
with
regard
to
the
present
a
people
who
with
the
same
words
on
its
banners
is
organising
a
despotic
oppressive
mischievous
and
ruinous
democracy
which
none
would
seek
to
imitate
this
is
what
germany
may
well
see
in
france
and
this
according
to
her
books
and
journals
is
we
may
assure
ourselves
what
she
does
see
for
the
rest
whatever
the
worth
of
the
verdicts
pronounced
upon
the
french
revolution
we
may
be
certain
that
the
writers
of
the
future
will
consider
it
as
an
event
as
passionately
interesting
as
it
is
instructive
a
government
bloodthirsty
enough
to
guillotine
old
men
of
eighty
years
young
girls
and
little
children
which
covered
france
with
ruins
and
yet
succeeded
in
repulsing
europe
in
arms
an
archduchess
of
austria
queen
of
france
dying
on
the
scaffold
and
a
few
years
later
another
archduchess
her
relative
replacing
her
on
the
same
throne
and
marrying
a
lieutenant
turned
emperor
here
are
tragedies
unique
in
human
history
the
psychologists
above
all
will
derive
lessons
from
a
history
hitherto
so
little
studied
by
them
no
doubt
they
will
finally
discover
that
psychology
can
make
no
progress
until
it
renounces
chimerical
theories
and
laboratory
experiments
in
order
to
study
the
events
and
the
men
who
surround
us
this
advice
is
far
from
being
banal
the
psychologists
of
the
day
pay
very
little
attention
to
the
world
about
them
and
are
even
surprised
that
any
one
should
study
it
i
have
come
across
an
interesting
proof
of
this
indifferent
frame
of
mind
in
a
review
of
one
of
my
books
which
appeared
in
the
revue
philosophique
and
was
inspired
by
the
editor
of
the
review
the
author
reproaches
me
with
exploring
the
world
and
the
newspapers
rather
than
books
i
most
gladly
accept
this
reproach
the
manifold
facts
of
the
journals
and
the
realities
of
the
world
are
far
more
instructive
than
philosophical
lucubrations
such
as
the
revue
is
stuffed
with
philosophers
are
beginning
to
see
the
puerility
of
such
reproaches
it
was
certainly
of
the
forty
volumes
of
this
fastidious
publication
that
william
james
was
thinking
when
he
wrote
that
all
these
dissertations
simply
represented
a
string
of
facts
clumsily
observed
and
a
few
quarrelsome
discussions
although
he
is
the
author
of
the
best
known
treatise
on
psychology
extant
the
eminent
thinker
realises
the
fragility
of
a
science
that
oozes
metaphysical
criticism
at
every
joint
for
more
than
twenty
years
i
have
tried
to
interest
psychologists
in
the
study
of
realities
but
the
stream
of
university
metaphysics
is
hardly
yet
turned
aside
although
it
has
lost
its
former
force
impartiality
in
history
impartiality
has
always
been
considered
as
the
most
essential
quality
of
the
historian
all
historians
since
tacitus
have
assured
us
that
they
are
impartial
in
reality
the
writer
sees
events
as
the
painter
sees
a
landscape
that
is
through
his
own
temperament
through
his
character
and
the
mind
of
the
race
a
number
of
artists
placed
before
the
same
landscape
would
necessarily
interpret
it
in
as
many
different
fashions
some
would
lay
stress
upon
details
neglected
by
others
each
reproduction
would
thus
be
a
personal
work
that
is
to
say
would
be
interpreted
by
a
certain
form
of
sensibility
it
is
the
same
with
the
writer
we
can
no
more
speak
of
the
impartiality
of
the
historian
than
we
can
speak
of
the
impartiality
of
the
painter
certainly
the
historian
may
confine
himself
to
the
reproduction
of
documents
and
this
is
the
present
tendency
but
these
documents
for
periods
as
near
us
as
the
revolution
are
so
abundant
that
a
man
whole
life
would
not
suffice
to
go
through
them
therefore
the
historian
must
make
a
choice
consciously
sometimes
but
more
often
unconsciously
the
author
will
select
the
material
which
best
corresponds
with
his
political
moral
and
social
opinions
it
is
therefore
impossible
unless
he
contents
himself
with
simple
chronologies
summing
up
each
event
with
a
few
words
and
a
date
to
produce
a
truly
impartial
volume
of
history
no
author
could
be
impartial
and
it
is
not
to
be
regretted
the
claim
to
impartiality
so
common
results
in
those
flat
gloomy
and
prodigiously
wearisome
works
which
render
the
comprehension
of
a
period
completely
impossible
should
the
historian
under
a
pretext
of
impartiality
abstain
from
judging
men
that
is
from
speaking
in
tones
of
admiration
or
reprobation
this
question
i
admit
allows
of
two
very
different
solutions
each
of
which
is
perfectly
correct
according
to
the
point
of
view
assumed
that
of
the
moralist
or
that
of
the
psychologist
the
moralist
must
think
exclusively
of
the
interest
of
society
and
must
judge
men
only
according
to
that
interest
by
the
very
fact
that
it
exists
and
wishes
to
continue
to
exist
a
society
is
obliged
to
admit
a
certain
number
of
rules
to
have
an
indestructible
standard
of
good
and
evil
and
consequently
to
create
very
definite
distinctions
between
vice
and
virtue
it
thus
finally
creates
average
types
to
which
the
man
of
the
period
approaches
more
or
less
closely
and
from
which
he
can
not
depart
very
widely
without
peril
to
society
it
is
by
such
similar
types
and
the
rules
derived
from
social
necessities
that
the
moralist
must
judge
the
men
of
the
past
praising
those
which
were
useful
and
blaming
the
rest
he
thus
helps
to
form
the
moral
types
which
are
indispensable
to
the
progress
of
civilisation
and
which
may
serve
others
as
models
poets
such
as
corneille
for
example
create
heroes
superior
to
the
majority
of
men
and
possibly
inimitable
but
they
thereby
help
greatly
to
stimulate
our
efforts
the
example
of
heroes
must
always
be
set
before
a
people
in
order
to
ennoble
its
mind
such
is
the
moralist
point
of
view
that
of
the
psychologist
would
be
quite
different
while
a
society
has
no
right
to
be
tolerant
because
its
first
duty
is
to
live
the
psychologist
may
remain
indifferent
considering
things
as
a
scientist
he
no
longer
asks
their
utilitarian
value
but
seeks
merely
to
explain
them
his
situation
is
that
of
the
observer
before
any
phenomenon
it
is
obviously
difficult
to
read
in
cold
blood
that
carrier
ordered
his
victims
to
be
buried
up
to
the
neck
so
that
they
might
then
be
blinded
and
subjected
to
horrible
torments
yet
if
we
wish
to
comprehend
such
acts
we
must
be
no
more
indignant
than
the
naturalist
before
the
spider
slowly
devouring
a
fly
as
soon
as
the
reason
is
moved
it
is
no
longer
reason
and
can
explain
nothing
the
functions
of
the
historian
and
the
psychologist
are
not
as
we
see
identical
but
of
both
we
may
demand
the
endeavour
by
a
wise
interpretation
of
the
facts
to
discover
under
the
visible
evidences
the
invisible
forces
which
determine
them
chapter
ii
the
psychological
foundations
of
the
ancien
regime
the
absolute
monarchy
and
the
bases
of
the
ancien
regime
many
historians
assure
us
that
the
revolution
was
directed
against
the
autocracy
of
the
monarchy
in
reality
the
kings
of
france
had
ceased
to
be
absolute
monarchs
long
before
its
outbreak
only
very
late
in
history
not
until
the
reign
of
louis
did
they
finally
obtain
incontestable
power
all
the
preceding
sovereigns
even
the
most
powerful
such
as
francis
for
example
had
to
sustain
a
constant
struggle
either
against
the
seigneurs
or
the
clergy
or
the
parliaments
and
they
did
not
always
win
francis
himself
had
not
sufficient
power
to
protect
his
most
intimate
friends
against
the
sorbonne
and
the
parliament
his
friend
and
councillor
berquin
having
offended
the
sorbonne
was
arrested
upon
the
order
of
the
latter
body
the
king
ordered
his
release
which
was
refused
he
was
obliged
to
send
archers
to
remove
him
from
the
conciergerie
and
could
find
no
other
means
of
protecting
him
than
that
of
keeping
him
beside
him
in
the
louvre
the
sorbonne
by
no
means
considered
itself
beaten
profiting
by
the
king
absence
it
arrested
berquin
again
and
had
him
tried
by
parliament
condemned
at
ten
in
the
morning
he
was
burned
alive
at
noon
built
up
very
gradually
the
power
of
the
kings
of
france
was
not
absolute
until
the
time
of
louis
xiv
it
then
rapidly
declined
and
it
would
be
truly
difficult
to
speak
of
the
absolutism
of
louis
xvi
this
pretended
master
was
the
slave
of
his
court
his
ministers
the
clergy
and
the
nobles
he
did
what
they
forced
him
to
do
and
rarely
what
he
wished
perhaps
no
frenchman
was
so
little
free
as
the
king
the
great
power
of
the
monarchy
resided
originally
in
the
divine
origin
which
was
attributed
to
it
and
in
the
traditions
which
had
accumulated
during
the
ages
these
formed
the
real
social
framework
of
the
country
the
true
cause
of
the
disappearance
of
the
ancien
regime
was
simply
the
weakening
of
the
traditions
which
served
as
its
foundations
when
after
repeated
criticism
it
could
find
no
more
defenders
the
ancien
regime
crumbled
like
a
building
whose
foundations
have
been
destroyed
the
inconveniences
of
the
ancien
regime
a
system
of
government
will
always
finally
seem
acceptable
to
the
people
governed
habit
masks
its
inconveniences
which
appear
only
when
men
begin
to
think
then
they
ask
how
they
could
ever
have
supported
them
the
truly
unhappy
man
is
the
man
who
believes
himself
miserable
it
was
precisely
this
belief
which
was
gaining
ground
at
the
time
of
the
revolution
under
the
influence
of
the
writers
whose
work
we
shall
presently
study
then
the
imperfections
of
the
ancien
regime
stared
all
men
in
the
face
they
were
numerous
it
is
enough
to
mention
a
few
despite
the
apparent
authority
of
the
central
power
the
kingdom
formed
by
the
successive
conquest
of
independent
provinces
was
divided
into
territories
each
of
which
had
its
own
laws
and
customs
and
each
of
which
paid
different
imposts
internal
separated
them
the
unity
of
france
was
thus
somewhat
artificial
it
represented
an
aggregate
of
various
countries
which
the
repeated
efforts
of
the
kings
including
louis
had
not
succeeded
in
wholly
unifying
the
most
useful
effect
of
the
revolution
was
this
very
unification
to
such
material
divisions
were
added
social
divisions
constituted
by
different
classes
nobles
clergy
and
the
third
estate
whose
rigid
barriers
could
only
with
the
utmost
difficulty
be
crossed
regarding
the
division
of
the
classes
as
one
of
its
sources
of
power
the
ancien
regime
had
rigorously
maintained
that
division
this
became
the
principal
cause
of
the
hatreds
which
the
system
inspired
much
of
the
violence
of
the
triumphant
bourgeoisie
represented
vengeance
for
a
long
past
of
disdain
and
oppression
the
wounds
of
are
the
most
difficult
of
all
to
forget
the
third
estate
had
suffered
many
such
wounds
at
a
meeting
of
the
states
general
in
at
which
its
representatives
were
obliged
to
remain
bareheaded
on
their
knees
one
member
of
the
third
estate
having
dared
to
say
that
the
three
orders
were
like
three
brothers
the
spokesman
of
the
nobles
replied
that
there
was
no
fraternity
between
it
and
the
third
that
the
nobles
did
not
wish
the
children
of
cobblers
and
tanners
to
call
them
their
brothers
despite
the
march
of
enlightenment
the
nobles
and
the
clergy
obstinately
preserved
their
privileges
and
their
demands
no
longer
justifiable
now
that
these
classes
had
ceased
to
render
services
kept
from
the
exercise
of
public
functions
by
the
royal
power
which
distrusted
them
and
progressively
replaced
by
a
bourgeoisie
which
was
more
and
more
learned
and
capable
the
social
role
of
nobility
and
clergy
was
only
an
empty
show
this
point
has
been
luminously
expounded
by
taine
since
the
nobility
having
lost
its
special
capacity
and
the
third
estate
having
acquired
general
capacity
were
now
on
a
level
in
respect
of
education
and
aptitudes
the
inequality
which
divided
them
had
become
hurtful
and
useless
instituted
by
custom
it
was
no
longer
ratified
by
the
consciousness
and
the
third
estate
was
with
reason
angered
by
privileges
which
nothing
justified
neither
the
capacity
of
the
nobles
nor
the
incapacity
of
the
bourgeoisie
by
reason
of
the
rigidity
of
castes
established
by
a
long
past
we
can
not
see
what
could
have
persuaded
the
nobles
and
the
clergy
to
renounce
their
privileges
certainly
they
did
finally
abandon
them
one
memorable
evening
when
events
forced
them
to
do
so
but
then
it
was
too
late
and
the
revolution
unchained
was
pursuing
its
course
it
is
certain
that
modern
progress
would
successively
have
established
all
that
the
revolution
effected
the
equality
of
citizens
before
the
law
the
suppression
of
the
privileges
of
birth
despite
the
conservative
spirit
of
the
latins
these
things
would
have
been
won
as
they
were
by
the
majority
of
the
peoples
we
might
in
this
manner
have
been
saved
twenty
years
of
warfare
and
devastation
but
we
must
have
had
a
different
mental
constitution
and
above
all
different
statesmen
the
profound
hostility
of
the
bourgeoisie
against
the
classes
maintained
above
it
by
tradition
was
one
of
the
great
factors
of
the
revolution
and
perfectly
explains
why
after
its
triumph
the
first
class
despoiled
the
vanquished
of
their
wealth
they
behaved
as
conquerors
like
william
the
conqueror
who
after
the
conquest
of
england
distributed
the
soil
among
his
soldiers
but
although
the
bourgeoisie
detested
the
nobility
they
had
no
hatred
for
royalty
and
did
not
regard
it
as
revocable
the
maladdress
of
the
king
and
his
appeals
to
foreign
powers
only
very
gradually
made
him
unpopular
the
first
assembly
never
dreamed
of
founding
a
republic
extremely
royalist
in
fact
it
thought
simply
to
substitute
a
constitutional
for
an
absolute
monarchy
only
the
consciousness
of
its
increasing
power
exasperated
it
against
the
resistance
of
the
king
but
it
dared
not
overthrow
him
life
under
the
ancien
regime
it
is
difficult
to
form
a
very
clear
idea
of
life
under
the
ancien
regime
and
above
all
of
the
real
situation
of
the
peasants
the
writers
who
defend
the
revolution
as
theologians
defend
religious
dogmas
draw
such
gloomy
pictures
of
the
existence
of
the
peasants
under
the
ancien
regime
that
we
ask
ourselves
how
it
was
that
all
these
unhappy
creatures
had
not
died
of
hunger
long
before
a
good
example
of
this
style
of
writing
may
be
found
in
a
book
by
rambaud
formerly
professor
at
the
sorbonne
published
under
the
title
history
of
the
french
revolution
one
notices
especially
an
engraving
bearing
the
legend
poverty
of
peasants
under
louis
xiv
in
the
foreground
a
man
is
fighting
some
dogs
for
some
bones
which
for
that
matter
are
already
quite
fleshless
beside
him
a
wretched
fellow
is
twisting
himself
and
compressing
his
stomach
farther
back
a
woman
lying
on
the
ground
is
eating
grass
at
the
back
of
the
landscape
figures
of
which
one
can
not
say
whether
they
are
corpses
or
persons
starving
are
also
stretched
on
the
soil
as
an
example
of
the
administration
of
the
ancien
regime
the
same
author
assures
us
that
a
place
in
the
police
cost
livres
and
brought
in
such
figures
surely
indicate
a
great
disinterestedness
on
the
part
of
those
who
sold
such
productive
employment
he
also
informs
us
that
it
cost
only
livres
to
get
people
arrested
and
that
under
louis
xv
more
than
lettres
de
cachet
were
distributed
the
majority
of
books
dealing
with
the
revolution
are
conceived
with
as
little
impartiality
and
critical
spirit
which
is
one
reason
why
this
period
is
really
so
little
known
to
us
certainly
there
is
no
lack
of
documents
but
they
are
absolutely
contradictory
to
the
celebrated
description
of
la
bruyere
we
may
oppose
the
enthusiastic
picture
drawn
by
the
english
traveller
young
of
the
prosperous
condition
of
the
peasants
of
some
of
the
french
provinces
were
they
really
crushed
by
taxation
and
did
they
as
has
been
stated
pay
of
their
revenue
instead
of
a
fifth
as
impossible
to
say
with
certainty
one
capital
fact
however
seems
to
prove
that
under
the
ancien
regime
the
situation
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
rural
districts
could
not
have
been
so
very
wretched
since
it
seems
established
that
more
than
a
third
of
the
soil
had
been
bought
by
peasants
we
are
better
informed
as
to
the
financial
system
it
was
very
oppressive
and
extremely
complicated
the
budgets
usually
showed
deficits
and
the
imposts
of
all
kinds
were
raised
by
tyrannical
at
the
very
moment
of
the
revolution
this
condition
of
the
finances
became
the
cause
of
universal
discontent
which
is
expressed
in
the
cahiers
of
the
states
general
let
us
remark
that
these
cahiers
did
not
represent
a
previous
state
of
affairs
but
an
actual
condition
due
to
a
crisis
of
poverty
produced
by
the
bad
harvest
of
and
the
hard
winter
of
what
would
these
cahiers
have
told
us
had
they
been
written
ten
years
earlier
despite
these
unfavourable
circumstances
the
cahiers
contained
no
revolutionary
ideas
the
most
advanced
merely
asked
that
taxes
should
be
imposed
only
with
the
consent
of
the
states
general
and
paid
by
all
alike
the
same
cahiers
sometimes
expressed
a
wish
that
the
power
of
the
king
should
be
limited
by
a
constitution
defining
his
rights
and
those
of
the
nation
if
these
wishes
had
been
granted
a
constitutional
monarchy
could
very
easily
have
been
substituted
for
the
absolute
monarchy
and
the
revolution
would
probably
have
been
avoided
unhappily
the
nobility
and
the
clergy
were
too
strong
and
louis
xvi
too
weak
for
such
a
solution
to
be
possible
moreover
it
would
have
been
rendered
extremely
difficult
by
the
demands
of
the
bourgeoisie
who
claimed
to
substitute
themselves
for
the
nobles
and
were
the
real
authors
of
the
revolution
the
movement
started
by
the
middle
classes
rapidly
exceeded
their
hopes
needs
and
aspirations
they
had
claimed
equality
for
their
own
profit
but
the
people
also
demanded
equality
the
revolution
thus
finally
became
the
popular
government
which
it
was
not
and
had
no
intention
of
becoming
at
the
outset
evolution
of
monarchical
feeling
during
the
revolution
despite
the
slow
evolution
of
the
affective
elements
it
is
certain
that
during
the
revolution
the
sentiments
not
of
the
people
only
but
also
of
the
revolutionary
assemblies
with
regard
to
the
monarchy
underwent
a
very
rapid
change
between
the
moment
when
the
legislators
of
the
first
assembly
surrounded
louis
xvi
with
respect
and
the
moment
when
his
head
was
cut
off
a
very
few
years
had
elapsed
these
changes
superficial
rather
than
profound
were
in
reality
a
mere
transposition
of
sentiments
of
the
same
order
the
love
which
the
men
of
this
period
professed
for
the
king
was
transferred
to
the
new
government
which
had
inherited
his
power
the
mechanism
of
such
a
transfer
may
easily
be
demonstrated
under
the
ancien
regime
the
sovereign
holding
his
power
by
divine
right
was
for
this
reason
invested
with
a
kind
of
supernatural
power
his
people
looked
up
to
him
from
every
corner
of
the
country
this
mystic
belief
in
the
absolute
power
of
royalty
was
shattered
only
when
repeated
experience
proved
that
the
power
attributed
to
the
adored
being
was
fictitious
he
then
lost
his
prestige
now
when
prestige
is
lost
the
crowd
will
not
forgive
the
fallen
idol
for
deluding
them
and
seek
anew
the
idol
without
which
they
can
not
exist
from
the
outset
of
the
revolution
numerous
facts
which
were
daily
repeated
revealed
to
the
most
fervent
believers
the
fact
that
royalty
no
longer
possessed
any
power
and
that
there
were
other
powers
capable
not
only
of
contending
with
royalty
but
possessed
of
superior
force
what
for
instance
was
thought
of
the
royal
power
by
the
multitudes
who
saw
the
king
held
in
check
by
the
assembly
and
incapable
in
the
heart
of
paris
of
defending
his
strongest
fortress
against
the
attacks
of
armed
bands
the
royal
weakness
thus
being
obvious
the
power
of
the
assembly
was
increasing
now
in
the
eyes
of
the
crowd
weakness
has
no
prestige
it
turns
always
to
force
in
the
assemblies
feeling
was
very
fluid
but
did
not
evolve
very
rapidly
for
which
reason
the
monarchical
faith
survived
the
taking
of
the
bastille
the
flight
of
the
king
and
his
understanding
with
foreign
sovereigns
the
royalist
faith
was
still
so
powerful
that
the
parisian
riots
and
the
events
which
led
to
the
execution
of
louis
xvi
were
not
enough
finally
to
destroy
in
the
provinces
the
species
of
secular
piety
which
enveloped
the
old
monarchy
as
an
instance
of
the
depth
of
this
hereditary
love
of
the
people
for
its
kings
michelet
relates
the
following
fact
which
occurred
in
the
reign
of
louis
xv
when
it
was
known
in
paris
that
louis
who
had
left
for
the
army
was
detained
ill
at
metz
it
was
night
people
got
up
and
ran
tumultuously
hither
and
thither
without
knowing
where
they
were
going
the
churches
were
opened
in
the
middle
of
the
night
people
assembled
at
every
jostling
and
questioning
one
another
without
knowing
what
they
were
after
in
several
churches
the
priest
who
was
reciting
the
prayer
for
the
king
health
was
stopped
by
his
tears
and
the
people
replied
by
sobs
and
cries
the
courier
who
brought
the
news
of
his
convalescence
was
embraced
and
almost
stifled
people
kissed
his
horse
and
led
him
in
triumph
every
street
resounded
with
a
cry
of
joy
king
is
healed
it
persisted
in
a
great
part
of
france
during
the
whole
of
the
revolution
and
was
the
origin
of
the
royalist
conspiracies
and
insurrections
in
various
departments
which
the
convention
had
such
trouble
to
suppress
the
royalist
faith
had
disappeared
in
paris
where
the
weakness
of
the
king
was
too
plainly
visible
but
in
the
provinces
the
royal
power
representing
god
on
earth
still
retained
its
prestige
the
royalist
sentiments
of
the
people
must
have
been
deeply
rooted
to
survive
the
guillotine
the
royalist
movements
persisted
indeed
during
the
whole
of
the
revolution
and
were
accentuated
under
the
directory
when
departments
sent
royalist
deputies
to
paris
which
provoked
the
directory
to
the
coup
of
fructidor
this
with
difficulty
repressed
by
the
revolution
contributed
to
the
success
of
bonaparte
when
he
came
to
occupy
the
throne
of
the
ancient
kings
and
in
great
measure
to

chapter
iii
mental
anarchy
at
the
time
of
the
revolution
and
the
influence
attributed
to
the
philosophers
origin
and
propagation
of
revolutionary
ideas
the
outward
life
of
men
in
every
age
is
moulded
upon
an
inward
life
consisting
of
a
framework
of
traditions
sentiments
and
moral
influences
which
direct
their
conduct
and
maintain
certain
fundamental
notions
which
they
accept
without
discussion
let
the
resistance
of
this
social
framework
weaken
and
ideas
which
could
have
had
no
force
before
will
germinate
and
develop
certain
theories
whose
success
was
enormous
at
the
time
of
the
revolution
would
have
encountered
an
impregnable
wall
two
centuries
earlier
the
aim
of
these
considerations
is
to
recall
to
the
reader
the
fact
that
the
outward
events
of
revolutions
are
always
a
consequence
of
invisible
transformations
which
have
slowly
gone
forward
in
men
minds
any
profound
study
of
a
revolution
necessitates
a
study
of
the
mental
soil
upon
which
the
ideas
that
direct
its
course
have
to
germinate
generally
slow
in
the
extreme
the
evolution
of
ideas
is
often
invisible
for
a
whole
generation
its
extent
can
only
be
grasped
by
comparing
the
mental
condition
of
the
same
social
classes
at
the
two
extremities
of
the
curve
which
the
mind
has
followed
to
realise
the
different
conceptions
of
royalty
entertained
by
educated
men
under
louis
xiv
and
louis
we
must
compare
the
political
theories
of
bossuet
and
turgot
bossuet
expressed
the
general
conceptions
of
his
time
concerning
the
absolute
monarchy
when
he
based
the
authority
of
a
government
upon
the
will
of
god
sole
judge
of
the
actions
of
kings
always
irresponsible
before
men
religious
faith
was
then
as
strong
as
the
monarchical
faith
from
which
it
seemed
inseparable
and
no
philosopher
could
have
shaken
it
the
writings
of
the
reforming
ministers
of
louis
those
of
turgot
for
instance
are
animated
by
quite
another
spirit
of
the
divine
right
of
kings
there
is
hardly
a
word
and
the
rights
of
the
peoples
begin
to
be
clearly
defined
many
events
had
contributed
to
prepare
for
such
an
evolution
unfortunate
wars
famines
imposts
general
poverty
at
the
end
of
the
reign
of
louis
slowly
destroyed
respect
for
monarchical
authority
was
replaced
by
a
mental
revolt
which
was
ready
to
manifest
itself
as
soon
as
occasion
should
arise
when
once
the
mental
framework
commences
to
crumble
the
end
comes
rapidly
this
is
why
at
the
time
of
the
revolution
ideas
were
so
quickly
propagated
which
were
by
no
means
new
but
which
until
then
had
exerted
no
influence
as
they
had
not
fallen
on
fruitful
ground
yet
the
ideas
which
were
then
so
attractive
and
effectual
had
often
been
expressed
for
a
long
time
they
had
inspired
the
politics
of
england
two
thousand
years
earlier
the
greek
and
latin
authors
had
written
in
defence
of
liberty
had
cursed
tyrants
and
proclaimed
the
rights
of
popular
sovereignty
the
middle
classes
who
effected
the
revolution
although
like
their
fathers
they
had
learned
all
these
things
in
were
not
in
any
degree
moved
by
them
because
the
moment
when
such
ideas
could
move
them
had
not
arrived
how
should
the
people
have
been
impressed
by
them
at
a
time
when
all
men
were
accustomed
to
regard
all
hierarchies
as
natural
necessities
the
actual
influence
of
the
philosophers
in
the
genesis
of
the
revolution
was
not
that
which
was
attributed
to
them
they
revealed
nothing
new
but
they
developed
the
critical
spirit
which
no
dogma
can
resist
once
the
way
is
prepared
for
its
downfall
under
the
influence
of
this
developing
critical
spirit
things
which
were
no
longer
very
greatly
respected
came
to
be
respected
less
and
less
when
tradition
and
prestige
had
disappeared
the
social
edifice
suddenly
fell
this
progressive
disaggregation
finally
descended
to
the
people
but
was
not
commenced
by
the
people
the
people
follows
examples
but
never
sets
them
the
philosophers
who
could
not
have
exerted
any
influence
over
the
people
did
exert
a
great
influence
over
the
enlightened
portion
of
the
nation
the
unemployed
nobility
who
had
long
been
ousted
from
their
old
functions
and
who
were
consequently
inclined
to
be
censorious
followed
their
leadership
incapable
of
foresight
the
nobles
were
the
first
to
break
with
the
traditions
that
were
their
only
raison
as
steeped
in
humanitarianism
and
rationalism
as
the
bourgeoisie
of
day
they
continually
sapped
their
own
privileges
by
their
criticisms
as
the
most
ardent
reformers
were
found
among
the
favourites
of
fortune
the
aristocracy
encouraged
dissertations
on
the
social
contract
the
rights
of
man
and
the
equality
of
citizens
at
the
theatre
it
applauded
plays
which
criticised
privileges
the
arbitrariness
and
the
incapacity
of
men
in
high
places
and
abuses
of
all
kinds
as
soon
as
men
lose
confidence
in
the
foundations
of
the
mental
framework
which
guides
their
conduct
they
feel
at
first
uneasy
and
then
discontented
all
classes
felt
their
old
motives
of
action
gradually
disappearing
things
that
had
seemed
sacred
for
centuries
were
now
sacred
no
longer
the
censorious
spirit
of
the
nobility
and
of
the
writers
of
the
day
would
not
have
sufficed
to
move
the
heavy
load
of
tradition
but
that
its
action
was
added
to
that
of
other
powerful
influences
we
have
already
stated
in
citing
bossuet
that
under
the
ancien
regime
the
religious
and
civil
governments
widely
separated
in
our
days
were
intimately
connected
to
injure
one
was
inevitably
to
injure
the
other
now
even
before
the
monarchical
idea
was
shaken
the
force
of
religious
tradition
was
greatly
diminished
among
cultivated
men
the
constant
progress
of
knowledge
had
sent
an
increasing
number
of
minds
from
theology
to
science
by
opposing
the
truth
observed
to
the
truth
revealed
this
mental
evolution
although
as
yet
very
vague
was
sufficient
to
show
that
the
traditions
which
for
so
many
centuries
had
guided
men
had
not
the
value
which
had
been
attributed
to
them
and
that
it
would
soon
be
necessary
to
replace
them
but
where
discover
the
new
elements
which
might
take
the
place
of
tradition
where
seek
the
magic
ring
which
would
raise
a
new
social
edifice
on
the
remains
of
that
which
no
longer
contented
men
men
were
agreed
in
attributing
to
reason
the
power
that
tradition
and
the
gods
seemed
to
have
lost
how
could
its
force
be
doubted
its
discoveries
having
been
innumerable
was
it
not
legitimate
to
suppose
that
by
applying
it
to
the
construction
of
societies
it
would
entirely
transform
them
its
possible
function
increased
very
rapidly
in
the
thoughts
of
the
more
enlightened
in
proportion
as
tradition
seemed
more
and
more
to
be
distrusted
the
sovereign
power
attributed
to
reason
must
be
regarded
as
the
culminating
idea
which
not
only
engendered
the
revolution
but
governed
it
throughout
during
the
whole
revolution
men
gave
themselves
up
to
the
most
persevering
efforts
to
break
with
the
past
and
to
erect
society
upon
a
new
plan
dictated
by
logic
slowly
filtering
downward
the
rationalistic
theories
of
the
philosophers
meant
to
the
people
simply
that
all
the
things
which
had
been
regarded
as
worthy
of
respect
were
now
no
longer
worthy
men
being
declared
equal
the
old
masters
need
no
longer
be
obeyed
the
multitude
easily
succeeded
in
ceasing
to
respect
what
the
upper
classes
themselves
no
longer
respected
when
the
barrier
of
respect
was
down
the
revolution
was
accomplished
the
first
result
of
this
new
mentality
was
a
general
insubordination
mme
vigee
lebrun
relates
that
on
the
promenade
at
longchamps
men
of
the
people
leaped
on
the
footboards
of
the
carriages
saying
next
year
you
will
be
behind
and
we
shall
be
inside
the
populace
was
not
alone
in
manifesting
insubordination
and
discontent
these
sentiments
were
general
on
the
eve
of
the
revolution
the
lesser
clergy
says
taine
are
hostile
to
the
prelates
the
provincial
gentry
to
the
nobility
of
the
court
the
vassals
to
the
seigneurs
the
peasants
to
the
townsmen
this
state
of
mind
which
had
been
communicated
from
the
nobles
and
clergy
to
the
people
also
invaded
the
army
at
the
moment
the
states
general
were
opened
necker
said
we
are
not
sure
of
the
troops
the
officers
were
becoming
humanitarian
and
philosophical
the
soldiers
recruited
from
the
lowest
class
of
the
population
did
not
philosophise
but
they
no
longer
obeyed
in
their
feeble
minds
the
ideas
of
equality
meant
simply
the
suppression
of
all
leaders
and
masters
and
therefore
of
all
obedience
in
more
than
twenty
regiments
threatened
their
officers
and
sometimes
as
at
nancy
threw
them
into
prison
the
mental
anarchy
which
after
spreading
through
all
the
classes
of
society
finally
invaded
the
army
was
the
principal
cause
of
the
disappearance
of
the
ancien
regime
it
was
the
defection
of
the
army
affected
by
the
ideas
of
the
third
estate
wrote
rivarol
that
destroyed
royalty
the
supposed
influence
of
the
philosophers
of
the
eighteenth
century
upon
the
genesis
of
the
revolution
their
dislike
of
democracy
although
the
philosophers
who
have
been
supposed
the
inspirers
of
the
french
revolution
did
attack
certain
privileges
and
abuses
we
must
not
for
that
reason
regard
them
as
partisans
of
popular
government
democracy
whose
role
in
greek
history
was
familiar
to
them
was
generally
highly
antipathetic
to
them
they
were
not
ignorant
of
the
destruction
and
violence
which
are
its
invariable
accompaniments
and
knew
that
in
the
time
of
aristotle
it
was
already
defined
as
a
state
in
which
everything
even
the
law
depends
on
the
multitude
set
up
as
a
tyrant
and
governed
by
a
few
declamatory
speakers
pierre
bayle
the
true
forerunner
of
voltaire
recalled
in
the
following
terms
the
consequences
of
popular
government
in
athens
if
one
considers
this
history
which
displays
at
great
length
the
tumult
of
the
assemblies
the
factions
dividing
the
city
the
seditious
disturbing
it
the
most
illustrious
subjects
persecuted
exiled
and
punished
by
death
at
the
will
of
a
violent
windbag
one
would
conclude
that
this
people
which
so
prided
itself
on
its
liberty
was
really
the
slave
of
a
small
number
of
caballers
whom
they
called
demagogues
and
who
made
it
turn
now
in
this
direction
now
in
that
as
their
passions
changed
almost
as
the
sea
heaps
the
waves
now
one
way
now
another
according
to
the
winds
which
trouble
it
you
will
seek
in
vain
in
macedonia
which
was
a
monarchy
for
as
many
examples
of
tyranny
as
athenian
history
will
afford
montesquieu
had
no
greater
admiration
for
the
democracy
having
described
the
three
forms
of
government
republican
monarchical
and
despotic
he
shows
very
clearly
what
popular
government
may
lead
to
men
were
free
with
laws
men
would
fain
be
free
without
them
what
was
a
maxim
is
called
severity
what
was
order
is
called
hindrance
formerly
the
welfare
of
individuals
constituted
the
public
wealth
but
now
the
public
wealth
becomes
the
patrimony
of
individuals
the
republic
is
spoil
and
its
strength
is
merely
the
power
of
a
few
citizens
and
the
licence
of
all
little
petty
tyrants
spring
up
who
have
all
the
vices
of
a
single
tyrant
very
soon
what
is
left
of
liberty
becomes
untenable
a
single
tyrant
arises
and
the
people
loses
all
even
the
advantages
of
corruption
democracy
has
therefore
two
extremes
to
avoid
the
extreme
of
the
spirit
of
equality
leads
to
the
despotism
of
a
single
person
as
the
despotism
of
a
single
person
leads
to
conquest
the
ideal
of
montesquieu
was
the
english
constitutional
government
which
prevented
the
monarchy
from
degenerating
into
despotism
otherwise
the
influence
of
this
philosopher
at
the
moment
of
the
revolution
was
very
slight
as
for
the
encyclopaedists
to
whom
such
a
considerable
role
is
attributed
they
hardly
dealt
with
politics
excepting
a
liberal
monarchist
like
voltaire
and
diderot
they
wrote
chiefly
in
defence
of
individual
liberty
opposing
the
encroachments
of
the
church
at
that
time
extremely
intolerant
and
inimical
to
philosophers
being
neither
socialists
nor
democrats
the
revolution
could
not
utilise
any
of
their
principles
voltaire
himself
was
by
no
means
a
partisan
of
democracy
democracy
he
said
seems
only
to
suit
a
very
small
country
and
even
then
it
must
be
fortunately
situated
little
as
it
may
be
it
will
make
many
mistakes
because
it
will
be
composed
of
men
discord
will
prevail
there
as
in
a
convent
full
of
monks
but
there
will
be
no
bartholomew
day
no
irish
massacres
no
sicilian
vespers
no
inquisition
no
condemnation
to
the
galleys
for
having
taken
water
from
the
sea
without
paying
for
it
unless
we
suppose
this
republic
to
be
composed
of
devils
in
a
corner
of
hell
all
these
men
who
are
supposed
to
have
inspired
the
revolution
had
opinions
which
were
far
from
subversive
and
it
is
really
difficult
to
see
that
they
had
any
real
influence
on
the
development
of
the
revolutionary
movement
rousseau
was
one
of
the
very
few
democratic
philosophers
of
his
age
which
is
why
his
contrat
social
became
the
bible
of
the
men
of
the
terror
it
seemed
to
furnish
the
rational
justification
necessary
to
excuse
the
acts
deriving
from
unconscious
mystic
and
affective
impulses
which
no
philosophy
had
inspired
to
be
quite
truthful
the
democratic
instincts
of
rousseau
were
by
no
means
above
suspicion
he
himself
considered
that
his
projects
for
social
reorganisation
based
upon
popular
sovereignty
could
be
applied
only
to
a
very
small
state
and
when
the
poles
asked
him
for
a
draft
democratic
constitution
he
advised
them
to
choose
a
hereditary
monarch
among
the
theories
of
rousseau
that
relating
to
the
perfection
of
the
primitive
social
state
had
a
great
success
he
asserted
together
with
various
writers
of
his
time
that
primitive
mankind
was
perfect
it
was
corrupted
only
by
society
by
modifying
society
by
means
of
good
laws
one
might
bring
back
the
happiness
of
the
early
world
ignorant
of
all
psychology
he
believed
that
men
were
the
same
throughout
time
and
space
and
that
they
could
all
be
ruled
by
the
same
laws
and
institutions
this
was
then
the
general
belief
the
vices
and
virtues
of
the
people
wrote
helvetius
are
always
a
necessary
effect
of
its
legislation
how
can
we
doubt
that
virtue
is
in
the
case
of
all
peoples
the
result
of
the
wisdom
more
or
less
perfect
of
the
administration
there
could
be
no
greater
mistake
the
philosophical
ideas
of
the
bourgeoisie
at
the
time
of
the
revolution
it
is
by
no
means
easy
to
say
just
what
were
the
social
and
political
conceptions
of
a
frenchman
of
the
middle
classes
at
the
moment
of
the
revolution
they
might
be
reduced
to
a
few
formulae
concerning
fraternity
equality
and
popular
government
summed
up
in
the
celebrated
declaration
of
the
rights
of
man
of
which
we
shall
have
occasion
to
quote
a
few
passages
the
philosophers
of
the
eighteenth
century
do
not
seem
to
have
been
very
highly
rated
by
the
men
of
the
revolution
rarely
are
they
quoted
in
the
speeches
of
the
time
hypnotised
by
their
classical
memories
of
greece
and
rome
the
new
legislators
read
their
plato
and
their
plutarch
they
wished
to
revive
the
constitution
of
sparta
with
its
manners
its
frugal
habits
and
its
laws
lycurgus
solon
miltiades
manlius
torquatus
brutus
mucius
scaevola
even
the
fabulous
minos
himself
became
as
familiar
in
the
tribune
as
in
the
theatre
and
the
public
went
crazy
over
them
the
shades
of
the
heroes
of
antiquity
hovered
over
the
revolutionary
assemblies
posterity
alone
has
replaced
them
by
the
shades
of
the
philosophers
of
the
eighteenth
century
we
shall
see
that
in
reality
the
men
of
this
period
generally
represented
as
bold
innovators
guided
by
subtle
philosophers
professed
to
effect
no
innovations
whatever
but
to
return
to
a
past
long
buried
in
the
mists
of
history
and
which
moreover
they
scarcely
ever
in
the
least
understood
the
more
reasonable
who
did
not
go
so
far
back
for
their
models
aimed
merely
at
adopting
the
english
constitutional
system
of
which
montesquieu
and
voltaire
had
sung
the
praises
and
which
all
nations
were
finally
to
imitate
without
violent
crises
their
ambitions
were
confined
to
a
desire
to
perfect
the
existing
monarchy
not
to
overthrow
it
but
in
time
of
revolution
men
often
take
a
very
different
path
from
that
they
propose
to
take
at
the
time
of
the
convocation
of
the
states
general
no
one
would
ever
have
supposed
that
a
revolution
of
peaceful
bourgeoisie
and
men
of
letters
would
rapidly
be
transformed
into
one
of
the
most
sanguinary
dictatorships
of
history
chapter
iv
psychological
illusions
respecting
the
french
revolution
illusions
respecting
primitive
man
the
return
to
a
state
of
nature
and
the
psychology
of
the
people
we
have
already
repeated
and
shall
again
repeat
that
the
errors
of
a
doctrine
do
not
hinder
its
propagation
so
that
all
we
have
to
consider
here
is
its
influence
upon
men
minds
but
although
the
criticism
of
erroneous
doctrines
is
seldom
of
practical
utility
it
is
extremely
interesting
from
a
psychological
point
of
view
the
philosopher
who
wishes
to
understand
the
working
of
men
minds
should
always
carefully
consider
the
illusions
which
they
live
with
never
perhaps
in
the
course
of
history
have
these
illusions
appeared
so
profound
and
so
numerous
as
during
the
revolution
one
of
the
most
prominent
was
the
singular
conception
of
the
nature
of
our
first
ancestors
and
primitive
societies
anthropology
not
having
as
yet
revealed
the
conditions
of
our
remoter
forbears
men
supposed
being
influenced
by
the
legends
of
the
bible
that
man
had
issued
perfect
from
the
hands
of
the
creator
the
first
societies
were
models
which
were
afterwards
ruined
by
civilisation
but
to
which
mankind
must
return
the
return
to
the
state
of
nature
was
very
soon
the
general
cry
the
fundamental
principle
of
all
morality
of
which
i
have
treated
in
my
writings
said
rousseau
is
that
man
is
a
being
naturally
good
loving
justice
and
order
modern
science
by
determining
from
the
surviving
remnants
the
conditions
of
life
of
our
first
ancestors
has
long
ago
shown
the
error
of
this
doctrine
primitive
man
has
become
an
ignorant
and
ferocious
brute
as
ignorant
as
the
modern
savage
of
goodness
morality
and
pity
governed
only
by
his
instinctive
impulses
he
throws
himself
on
his
prey
when
hunger
drives
him
from
his
cave
and
falls
upon
his
enemy
the
moment
he
is
aroused
by
hatred
reason
not
being
born
could
have
no
hold
over
his
instincts
the
aim
of
civilisation
contrary
to
all
revolutionary
beliefs
has
been
not
to
return
to
the
state
of
nature
but
to
escape
from
it
it
was
precisely
because
the
jacobins
led
mankind
back
to
the
primitive
condition
by
destroying
all
the
social
restraints
without
which
no
civilisation
can
exist
that
they
transformed
a
political
society
into
a
barbarian
horde
the
ideas
of
these
theorists
concerning
the
nature
of
man
were
about
as
valuable
as
those
of
a
roman
general
concerning
the
power
of
omens
yet
their
influence
as
motives
of
action
was
considerable
the
convention
was
always
inspired
by
such
ideas
the
errors
concerning
our
primitive
ancestors
were
excusable
enough
since
before
modern
discoveries
had
shown
us
the
real
conditions
of
their
existence
these
were
absolutely
unknown
but
the
absolute
ignorance
of
human
psychology
displayed
by
the
men
of
the
revolution
is
far
less
easy
to
understand
it
would
really
seem
as
though
the
philosophers
and
writers
of
the
eighteenth
century
must
have
been
totally
deficient
in
the
smallest
faculty
of
observation
they
lived
amidst
their
contemporaries
without
seeing
them
and
without
understanding
them
above
all
they
had
not
a
suspicion
of
the
true
nature
of
the
popular
mind
the
man
of
the
people
always
appeared
to
them
in
the
likeness
of
the
chimerical
model
created
by
their
dreams
as
ignorant
of
psychology
as
of
the
teachings
of
history
they
considered
the
plebeian
man
as
naturally
good
affectionate
grateful
and
always
ready
to
listen
to
reason
the
speeches
delivered
by
members
of
the
assembly
show
how
profound
were
these
illusions
when
the
peasants
began
to
burn
the
chateaux
they
were
greatly
astonished
and
addressed
them
in
sentimental
harangues
praying
them
to
cease
in
order
not
to
give
pain
to
their
good
king
and
adjured
them
to
surprise
him
by
their
virtues
illusions
respecting
the
possibility
of
separating
man
from
his
past
and
the
power
of
transformation
attributed
to
the
law
one
of
the
principles
which
served
as
a
foundation
for
the
revolutionary
institutions
was
that
man
may
readily
be
cut
off
from
his
past
and
that
a
society
may
be
in
all
its
parts
by
means
of
institutions
persuaded
in
the
light
of
reason
that
except
for
the
primitive
ages
which
were
to
serve
as
models
the
past
represented
an
inheritance
of
errors
and
superstitions
the
legislators
of
the
day
resolved
to
break
entirely
with
that
past
the
better
to
emphasise
their
intention
they
founded
a
new
era
transformed
the
calendar
and
changed
the
names
of
the
months
and
seasons
supposing
all
men
to
be
alike
they
thought
they
could
legislate
for
the
human
race
condorcet
imagined
that
he
was
expressing
an
evident
truth
when
he
said
a
good
law
must
be
good
for
all
men
just
as
a
geometrical
proposition
is
true
for
all
the
theorists
of
the
revolution
never
perceived
behind
the
world
of
visible
things
the
secret
springs
which
moved
them
a
century
of
biological
progress
was
needed
to
show
how
grievous
were
their
mistakes
and
how
wholly
a
being
of
whatever
species
depends
on
its
past
with
the
influence
of
the
past
the
reformers
of
the
revolution
were
always
clashing
without
ever
understanding
it
they
wanted
to
annihilate
it
but
were
annihilated
by
it
instead
the
faith
of
in
the
absolute
power
of
laws
and
institutions
rudely
shaken
by
the
end
of
the
revolution
was
absolute
at
its
outbreak
gregoire
said
from
the
tribune
of
the
constituent
assembly
without
provoking
the
least
astonishment
we
could
if
we
would
change
religion
but
we
do
not
want
to
we
know
that
they
did
want
to
later
and
we
know
how
miserably
their
attempt
failed
yet
the
jacobins
had
in
their
hands
all
the
elements
of
success
thanks
to
the
completest
of
tyrannies
all
obstacles
were
removed
and
the
laws
which
it
pleased
them
to
impose
were
always
accepted
after
ten
years
of
violence
of
destruction
and
burning
and
pillage
and
massacre
and
general
upheaval
their
impotence
was
revealed
so
startlingly
that
they
fell
into
universal
reprobation
the
dictator
then
invoked
by
the
whole
of
france
was
obliged
to
the
greater
part
of
that
which
had
been
destroyed
the
attempt
of
the
jacobins
to
society
in
the
name
of
pure
reason
constitutes
an
experiment
of
the
highest
interest
probably
mankind
will
never
have
occasion
to
repeat
it
on
so
vast
a
scale
although
the
lesson
was
a
terrible
one
it
does
not
seem
to
have
been
sufficient
for
a
considerable
class
of
minds
since
even
in
our
days
we
hear
socialists
propose
to
rebuild
society
from
top
to
bottom
according
to
their
chimerical
plans
illusions
respecting
the
theoretical
value
of
the
great
revolutionary
principles
the
fundamental
principles
on
which
the
revolution
was
based
in
order
to
create
a
new
dispensation
are
contained
in
the
declarations
of
rights
which
were
formulated
successively
in
and
all
three
declarations
agree
in
proclaiming
that
the
principle
of
sovereignty
resides
in
the
nation
for
the
rest
the
three
declarations
differ
on
several
points
notably
in
the
matter
of
equality
that
of
simply
states
article
men
are
born
and
remain
free
and
having
equal
rights
that
of
goes
farther
and
assures
us
article
all
men
are
equal
by
nature
that
of
is
more
modest
and
says
article
equality
consists
in
the
law
being
the
same
for
all
besides
this
having
mentioned
rights
the
third
declaration
considers
it
useful
to
speak
of
duties
its
morality
is
simply
that
of
the
gospel
article
says
all
the
duties
of
a
man
and
a
citizen
derive
from
these
two
principles
engraved
on
all
hearts
by
nature
do
not
do
unto
others
that
which
you
would
not
they
should
do
unto
you
do
constantly
unto
others
the
good
you
would
wish
to
receive
from
them
the
essential
portions
of
these
proclamations
the
only
portions
which
have
really
survived
were
those
relating
to
equality
and
popular
sovereignty
despite
the
weakness
of
its
rational
meaning
the
part
played
by
the
republican
device
liberty
equality
fraternity
was
considerable
this
magic
formula
which
is
still
left
engraven
on
many
of
our
walls
until
it
shall
be
engraven
on
our
hearts
has
really
possessed
the
supernatural
power
attributed
to
certain
words
by
the
old
sorcerers
thanks
to
the
new
hopes
excited
by
its
promises
its
power
of
expansion
was
considerable
thousands
of
men
lost
their
lives
for
it
even
in
our
days
when
a
revolution
breaks
out
in
any
part
of
the
world
the
same
formula
is
always
invoked
its
choice
was
happy
in
the
extreme
it
belongs
to
the
category
of
indefinite
sentences
which
every
one
is
free
to
interpret
according
to
his
own
desires
hatreds
and
hopes
in
matters
of
faith
the
real
sense
of
words
matters
very
little
it
is
the
meaning
attached
to
them
that
makes
their
importance
of
the
three
principles
of
the
revolutionary
device
equality
was
most
fruitful
of
consequences
we
shall
see
in
another
part
of
this
book
that
it
is
almost
the
only
one
which
still
survives
and
is
still
productive
of
effects
it
was
certainly
not
the
revolution
that
introduced
the
idea
of
equality
into
the
world
without
going
back
even
to
the
greek
republics
we
may
remark
that
the
theory
of
equality
was
taught
in
the
clearest
fashion
by
christianity
and
islamism
all
men
subjects
of
the
one
god
were
equal
before
him
and
judged
solely
according
to
their
merits
the
dogma
of
the
equality
of
souls
before
god
was
an
essential
dogma
with
mohammedans
as
well
as
with
christians
but
to
proclaim
a
principle
is
not
enough
to
secure
its
observation
the
christian
church
soon
renounced
its
theoretical
equality
and
the
men
of
the
revolution
only
remembered
it
in
their
speeches
the
sense
of
the
term
equality
varies
according
to
the
persons
using
it
it
often
conceals
sentiments
very
contrary
to
its
real
sense
and
then
represents
the
imperious
need
of
having
no
one
above
one
joined
to
the
no
less
lively
desire
to
feel
above
others
with
the
jacobins
of
the
revolution
as
with
those
of
our
days
the
word
equality
simply
involves
a
jealous
hatred
of
all
superiority
to
efface
superiority
such
men
pretend
to
unify
manners
customs
and
situations
all
despotisms
but
that
exercised
by
themselves
seem
odious
not
being
able
to
avoid
the
natural
inequalities
they
deny
them
the
second
declaration
of
rights
that
of
affirms
contrary
to
the
evidence
that
all
men
are
equal
by
nature
it
would
seem
that
in
many
of
the
men
of
the
revolution
the
ardent
desire
for
equality
merely
concealed
an
intense
need
of
inequalities
napoleon
was
obliged
to
titles
of
nobility
and
decorations
for
their
benefit
having
shown
that
it
was
among
the
most
rabid
revolutionists
that
he
found
the
most
docile
instruments
of
domination
taine
continues
suddenly
through
all
their
preaching
of
liberty
and
equality
appeared
their
authoritative
instincts
their
need
of
commanding
even
as
subordinates
and
also
in
most
cases
an
appetite
for
money
or
for
pleasure
between
the
delegate
of
the
committee
of
public
safety
and
the
minister
prefect
or
subprefect
of
the
empire
the
difference
is
small
it
is
the
same
man
under
the
two
costumes
first
en
carmagnole
then
in
the
braided
coat
the
dogma
of
equality
had
as
its
first
consequence
the
proclamation
of
popular
sovereignty
by
the
bourgeoisie
this
sovereignty
remained
otherwise
highly
theoretical
during
the
whole
revolution
the
principle
of
authority
was
the
lasting
legacy
of
the
revolution
the
two
terms
liberty
and
fraternity
which
accompany
it
in
the
republican
device
had
never
much
influence
we
may
even
say
that
they
had
none
during
the
revolution
and
the
empire
but
merely
served
to
decorate
men
speeches
their
influence
was
hardly
more
considerable
later
fraternity
was
never
practised
and
the
peoples
have
never
cared
much
for
liberty
our
have
completely
surrendered
it
to
their
unions
to
sum
up
although
the
republican
motto
has
been
little
applied
it
has

practically
nothing
has

psychological
influences
active
during
the
french
revolution
the
genesis
of
the
french
revolution
as
well
as
its
duration
was
conditioned
by
elements
of
a
rational
affective
mystic
and
collective
nature
each
category
of
which
was
ruled
by
a
different
logic
it
is
as
i
have
said
because
they
have
not
been
able
to
dissociate
the
respective
influences
of
these
factors
that
so
many
historians
have
interpreted
this
period
so
indifferently
the
rational
element
usually
invoked
as
an
explanation
exerted
in
reality
but
a
very
slight
influence
it
prepared
the
way
for
the
revolution
but
maintained
it
only
at
the
outset
while
it
was
still
exclusively
its
action
was
manifested
by
many
measures
of
the
time
such
as
the
proposals
to
reform
the
taxes
the
suppression
of
the
privileges
of
a
useless
nobility
as
soon
as
the
revolution
reached
the
people
the
influence
of
the
rational
elements
speedily
vanished
before
that
of
the
affective
and
collective
elements
as
for
the
mystic
elements
the
foundation
of
the
revolutionary
faith
they
made
the
army
fanatical
and
propagated
the
new
belief
throughout
the
world
we
shall
see
these
various
elements
as
they
appeared
in
events
and
in
the
psychology
of
individuals
perhaps
the
most
important
was
the
mystic
element
the
revolution
can
not
be
clearly
comprehended
we
can
not
repeat
it
too
often
unless
it
is
considered
as
the
formation
of
a
religious
belief
what
i
have
said
elsewhere
of
all
beliefs
applies
equally
to
the
revolution
referring
for
instance
to
the
chapter
on
the
reformation
the
reader
will
see
that
it
presents
more
than
one
analogy
with
the
revolution
having
wasted
so
much
time
in
demonstrating
the
slight
rational
value
of
beliefs
the
philosophers
are
beginning
to
understand
their
function
better
they
have
been
forced
to
admit
that
these
are
the
only
factors
which
possess
an
influence
sufficient
to
transform
all
the
elements
of
a
civilisation
they
impose
themselves
on
men
apart
from
reason
and
have
the
power
to
polarise
men
thoughts
and
feelings
in
one
direction
pure
reason
had
never
such
a
power
for
men
were
never
impassioned
by
reason
the
religious
form
rapidly
assumed
by
the
revolution
explains
its
power
of
expansion
and
the
prestige
which
it
possessed
and
has
retained
few
historians
have
understood
that
this
great
monument
ought
to
be
regarded
as
the
foundation
of
a
new
religion
the
penetrating
mind
of
tocqueville
i
believe
was
the
first
to
perceive
as
much
the
french
revolution
he
wrote
was
a
political
revolution
which
operated
in
the
manner
of
and
assumed
something
of
the
aspect
of
a
religious
revolution
see
by
what
regular
and
characteristic
traits
it
finally
resembled
the
latter
not
only
did
it
spread
itself
far
and
wide
like
a
religious
revolution
but
like
the
latter
it
spread
itself
by
means
of
preaching
and
propaganda
a
political
revolution
which
inspires
proselytes
which
is
preached
as
passionately
to
foreigners
as
it
is
accomplished
at
home
consider
what
a
novel
spectacle
was
this
the
religious
side
of
the
revolution
being
granted
the
accompanying
fury
and
devastation
are
easily
explained
history
shows
us
that
such
are
always
the
accompaniments
of
the
birth
of
religions
the
revolution
was
therefore
certain
to
provoke
the
violence
and
intolerance
the
triumphant
deities
demand
from
their
adepts
it
overturned
all
europe
for
twenty
years
ruined
france
caused
the
death
of
millions
of
men
and
cost
the
country
several
invasions
but
it
is
as
a
rule
only
at
the
cost
of
such
catastrophes
that
a
people
can
change
its
beliefs
although
the
mystic
element
is
always
the
foundation
of
beliefs
certain
affective
and
rational
elements
are
quickly
added
thereto
a
belief
thus
serves
to
group
sentiments
and
passions
and
interests
which
belong
to
the
affective
domain
reason
then
envelops
the
whole
seeking
to
justify
events
in
which
however
it
played
no
part
whatever
at
the
moment
of
the
revolution
every
one
according
to
his
aspirations
dressed
the
new
belief
in
a
different
rational
vesture
the
peoples
saw
in
it
only
the
suppression
of
the
religious
and
political
despotisms
and
hierarchies
under
which
they
had
so
often
suffered
writers
like
goethe
and
thinkers
like
kant
imagined
that
they
saw
in
it
the
triumph
of
reason
foreigners
like
humboldt
came
to
france
to
breathe
the
air
of
liberty
and
to
assist
at
the
obsequies
of
despotism
these
intellectual
illusions
did
not
last
long
the
evolution
of
the
drama
soon
revealed
the
true
foundations
of
the
dream
dissolution
of
the
ancien
regime
the
assembling
of
the
states
general
before
they
are
realised
in
action
revolutions
are
sketched
out
in
men
thoughts
prepared
by
the
causes
already
studied
the
french
revolution
commenced
in
reality
with
the
reign
of
louis
xvi
more
discontented
and
censorious
every
day
the
middle
classes
added
claim
to
claim
everybody
was
calling
for
reform
louis
xvi
thoroughly
understood
the
utility
of
reform
but
he
was
too
weak
to
impose
it
on
the
clergy
and
the
nobility
he
could
not
even
retain
his
reforming
ministers
malesherbes
and
turgot
what
with
famines
and
increased
taxation
the
poverty
of
all
classes
increased
and
the
huge
pensions
drawn
by
the
court
formed
a
shocking
contrast
to
the
general
distress
the
notables
convoked
to
attempt
to
remedy
the
financial
situation
refused
a
system
of
equal
taxation
and
granted
only
insignificant
reforms
which
the
parliament
did
not
even
consent
to
register
it
had
to
be
dissolved
the
provincial
parliaments
made
common
cause
with
that
of
paris
and
were
also
dissolved
but
they
led
opinion
and
in
all
parts
of
france
promoted
the
demand
for
a
meeting
of
the
states
general
which
had
not
been
convoked
for
nearly
two
hundred
years
the
decision
was
taken
frenchmen
of
whom
were
ecclesiastics
and
nobles
sent
their
representatives
there
were
in
all
deputies
of
whom
were
of
the
third
estate
consisting
chiefly
of
magistrates
advocates
and
physicians
of
the
deputies
of
the
clergy
of
plebeian
origin
threw
in
their
lot
with
the
third
estate
against
the
nobility
and
clergy
from
the
first
sessions
a
psychological
conflict
broke
out
between
the
deputies
of
different
social
conditions
and
therefore
different
mentalities
the
magnificent
costumes
of
the
privileged
deputies
contrasted
in
a
humiliating
fashion
with
the
sombre
fashions
of
the
third
estate
at
the
first
session
the
members
of
the
nobility
and
the
clergy
were
covered
according
to
the
prerogatives
of
their
class
before
the
king
those
of
the
third
estate
wished
to
imitate
them
but
the
privileged
members
protested
on
the
following
day
more
protests
of
wounded
were
heard
the
deputies
of
the
third
estate
invited
those
of
the
nobility
and
the
clergy
who
were
sitting
in
separate
halls
to
join
them
for
the
verification
of
their
powers
the
nobles
refused
the
negotiations
lasted
more
than
a
month
finally
the
deputies
of
the
third
estate
on
the
proposition
of
the
abbe
sieyes
considering
that
they
represented
per
cent
of
the
nation
declared
themselves
constituted
as
a
national
assembly
from
that
moment
the
revolution
pursued
its
course
the
constituent
assembly
the
power
of
a
political
assembly
resides
above
all
in
the
weakness
of
its
adversaries
astonished
by
the
slight
resistance
encountered
and
carried
away
by
the
ascendancy
of
a
handful
of
orators
the
constituent
assembly
from
its
earliest
sessions
spoke
and
acted
as
a
sovereign
body
notably
it
arrogated
to
itself
the
power
of
decreeing
imposts
a
serious
encroachment
upon
the
prerogatives
of
the
royal
power
the
resistance
of
louis
xvi
was
feeble
enough
he
simply
had
the
hall
in
which
the
states
assembled
closed
the
deputies
then
met
in
the
hall
of
the
and
took
the
oath
that
they
would
not
separate
until
the
constitution
of
the
kingdom
was
an
established
fact
the
majority
of
the
deputies
of
the
clergy
went
with
them
the
king
revoked
the
decision
of
the
assembly
and
ordered
the
deputies
to
retire
the
marquis
de
the
grand
master
of
ceremonies
having
invited
them
to
obey
the
order
of
the
sovereign
the
president
of
the
assembly
declared
that
the
nation
assembled
can
not
receive
orders
and
mirabeau
replied
to
the
envoy
of
the
sovereign
that
being
united
by
the
will
of
the
people
the
assembly
would
only
withdraw
at
the
point
of
the
bayonet
again
the
king
gave
way
on
the
of
june
the
meeting
of
deputies
took
the
title
of
the
constituent
assembly
for
the
first
time
in
centuries
the
king
was
forced
to
recognise
the
existence
of
a
new
power
formerly
ignored
that
of
the
people
represented
by
its
elected
representatives
the
absolute
monarchy
was
no
more
feeling
himself
more
and
more
seriously
threatened
louis
xvi
summoned
to
versailles
a
number
of
regiments
composed
of
foreign
mercenaries
the
assembly
demanded
the
withdrawal
of
the
troops
the
king
refused
and
dismissed
necker
replacing
him
by
the
marshal
de
broglie
reputed
to
be
an
extremely
authoritative
person
but
the
assembly
had
able
supporters
camille
desmoulins
and
others
harangued
the
crowd
in
all
directions
calling
it
to
the
defence
of
liberty
they
sounded
the
tocsin
organised
a
militia
of
men
took
muskets
and
cannon
from
the
invalides
and
on
the
of
july
the
armed
bands
marched
upon
the
bastille
the
fortress
barely
defended
capitulated
in
a
few
hours
seven
prisoners
were
found
within
it
of
whom
one
was
an
idiot
and
four
were
accused
of
forgery
the
bastille
the
prison
of
many
victims
of
arbitrary
power
symbolised
the
royal
power
to
many
minds
but
the
people
who
demolished
it
had
not
suffered
by
it
scarcely
any
but
members
of
the
nobility
were
imprisoned
there
the
influence
exercised
by
the
taking
of
this
fortress
has
continued
to
our
days
serious
historians
like
rambaud
assure
us
that
the
taking
of
the
bastille
is
a
culminating
fact
in
the
history
not
of
france
only
but
of
all
europe
and
inaugurates
a
new
epoch
in
the
history
of
the
world
such
credulity
is
a
little
excessive
the
importance
of
the
event
lay
simply
in
the
psychological
fact
that
for
the
first
time
the
people
received
an
obvious
proof
of
the
weakness
of
an
authority
which
had
lately
been
formidable
when
the
principle
of
authority
is
injured
in
the
public
mind
it
dissolves
very
rapidly
what
might
not
one
demand
of
a
king
who
could
not
defend
his
principal
fortress
against
popular
attacks
the
master
regarded
as
had
ceased
to
be
so
the
taking
of
the
bastille
was
the
beginning
of
one
of
those
phenomena
of
mental
contagion
which
abound
in
the
history
of
the
revolution
the
foreign
mercenary
troops
although
they
could
scarcely
be
interested
in
the
movement
began
to
show
symptoms
of
mutiny
louis
xvi
was
reduced
to
accepting
their
disbandment
he
recalled
necker
went
to
the
hotel
de
ville
sanctioned
by
his
presence
the
accomplished
facts
and
accepted
from
la
fayette
commandant
of
the
national
guard
the
new
cockade
of
red
white
and
blue
which
allied
the
colours
of
paris
to
those
of
the
king
although
the
riot
which
ended
in
the
taking
of
the
bastille
can
by
no
means
be
regarded
as
a
culminating
fact
in
history
it
does
mark
the
precise
moment
of
the
commencement
of
popular
government
the
armed
people
thenceforth
intervened
daily
in
the
deliberations
of
the
revolutionary
assemblies
and
seriously
influenced
their
conduct
this
intervention
of
the
people
in
conformity
with
the
dogma
of
its
sovereignty
has
provoked
the
respectful
admiration
of
many
historians
of
the
revolution
even
a
superficial
study
of
the
psychology
of
crowds
would
speedily
have
shown
them
that
the
mystic
entity
which
they
call
the
people
was
merely
translating
the
will
of
a
few
leaders
it
is
not
correct
to
say
that
the
people
took
the
bastille
attacked
the
tuileries
invaded
the
convention
but
that
certain
leaders
generally
by
means
of
the
clubs
united
armed
bands
of
the
populace
which
they
led
against
the
bastille
the
tuileries
during
the
revolution
the
same
crowds
attacked
or
defended
the
most
contrary
parties
according
to
the
leaders
who
happened
to
be
at
their
heads
a
crowd
never
has
any
opinion
but
that
of
its
leaders
example
constituting
one
of
the
most
potent
forms
of
suggestion
the
taking
of
the
bastille
was
inevitably
followed
by
the
destruction
of
other
fortresses
many
chateaux
were
regarded
as
so
many
little
bastilles
and
in
order
to
imitate
the
parisians
who
had
destroyed
theirs
the
peasants
began
to
burn
them
they
did
so
with
the
greater
fury
because
the
seigneurial
homes
contained
the
titles
of
feudal
dues
it
was
a
species
of
jacquerie
the
constituent
assembly
so
proud
and
haughty
towards
the
king
was
like
all
the
revolutionary
assemblies
which
followed
it
extremely
pusillanimous
before
the
people
hoping
to
put
an
end
to
the
disorders
of
the
night
of
august
it
voted
on
the
proposition
of
a
member
of
the
nobility
the
comte
de
noailles
the
abolition
of
seigneurial
rights
although
this
measure
suppressed
at
one
stroke
the
privileges
of
the
nobles
it
was
voted
with
tears
and
embracings
such
accesses
of
sentimental
enthusiasm
are
readily
explained
when
we
recall
how
contagious
emotion
is
in
a
crowd
above
all
in
an
assembly
oppressed
by
fear
if
the
renunciation
of
their
rights
had
been
effected
by
the
nobility
a
few
years
earlier
the
revolution
would
doubtless
have
been
avoided
but
it
was
now
too
late
to
give
way
only
when
one
is
forced
to
do
so
merely
increases
the
demands
of
those
to
whom
one
yields
in
politics
one
should
always
look
ahead
and
give
way
long
before
one
is
forced
to
do
so
louis
xvi
hesitated
for
two
months
to
ratify
the
decisions
voted
by
the
assembly
on
the
night
of
the
of
august
he
had
retired
to
versailles
the
leaders
sent
thither
a
band
of
or
men
and
women
of
the
people
assuring
them
that
the
royal
residence
contained
great
stores
of
bread
the
railings
of
the
palace
were
forced
some
of
the
bodyguard
were
killed
and
the
king
and
all
his
family
were
led
back
to
paris
in
the
midst
of
a
shrieking
crowd
many
of
whom
bore
on
the
ends
of
their
pikes
the
heads
of
the
soldiers
massacred
the
dreadful
journey
lasted
six
hours
these
events
constituted
what
are
known
as
the
days
of
october
the
popular
power
increased
and
in
reality
the
king
like
the
whole
assembly
was
henceforth
in
the
hands
of
the
people
that
is
at
the
mercy
of
the
clubs
and
their
leaders
this
popular
power
was
to
prevail
for
nearly
ten
years
and
the
revolution
was
to
be
almost
entirely
its
work
while
proclaiming
that
the
people
constituted
the
only
sovereign
the
assembly
was
greatly
embarrassed
by
riots
which
went
far
beyond
its
theoretical
expectations
it
had
supposed
that
order
would
be
restored
while
it
fabricated
a
constitution
destined
to
assure
the
eternal
happiness
of
mankind
we
know
that
during
the
whole
duration
of
the
revolution
one
of
the
chief
occupations
of
the
assemblies
was
to
make
unmake
and
remake
constitutions
the
theorists
attributed
to
them
then
as
they
do
the
power
of
transforming
society
the
assembly
therefore
could
not
neglect
its
task
in
the
meantime
it
published
a
solemn
declaration
of
the
rights
of
man
which
summarised
its
principles
the
constitution
proclamations
declarations
and
speeches
had
not
the
slightest
effect
on
the
popular
movements
nor
on
the
dissentients
who
daily
increased
in
number
in
the
heart
of
the
assembly
the
latter
became
more
and
more
subjected
to
the
ascendancy
of
the
advanced
party
which
was
supported
by
the
clubs
danton
camille
desmoulins
and
later
marat
and
hebert
violently
excited
the
populace
by
their
harangues
and
their
journals
the
assembly
was
rapidly
going
down
the
slope
that
leads
to
extremes
during
all
these
disorders
the
finances
of
the
country
were
not
improving
finally
convinced
that
philanthropic
speeches
would
not
alter
their
lamentable
condition
and
seeing
that
bankruptcy
threatened
the
assembly
decreed
on
the
of
november
the
confiscation
of
the
goods
of
the
church
their
revenues
consisting
of
the
tithes
collected
from
the
faithful
amounted
to
some
and
their
value
was
estimated
at
about
they
were
divided
among
some
hundreds
of
prelates
court
abbes
who
owned
a
quarter
of
all
france
these
goods
henceforth
entitled
is
national
domains
formed
the
guarantee
of
the
assignats
the
first
issue
of
which
was
for
francs
sterling
the
public
accepted
them
at
the
outset
but
they
multiplied
so
under
the
directory
and
the
convention
which
issued
francs
in
this
form
sterling
that
an
assignat
of
livres
was
finally
worth
only
a
few
halfpence
stimulated
by
his
advisers
the
feeble
louis
attempted
in
vain
to
struggle
against
the
decrees
of
the
assembly
by
refusing
to
sanction
them
under
the
influence
of
the
daily
suggestions
of
the
leaders
and
the
power
of
mental
contagion
the
revolutionary
movement
was
spreading
everywhere
independently
of
the
assembly
and
often
even
against
it
in
the
towns
and
villages
revolutionary
municipalities
were
instituted
protected
by
the
local
national
guards
those
of
neighbouring
towns
commenced
to
make
mutual
arrangements
to
defend
themselves
should
need
arise
thus
federations
were
formed
which
were
soon
rolled
into
one
this
sent
national
guards
to
paris
who
assembled
on
the
on
the
of
july
there
the
king
swore
to
maintain
the
constitution
decreed
by
the
national
assembly
despite
this
vain
oath
it
became
more
evident
every
day
that
no
agreement
was
possible
between
the
hereditary
principles
of
the
monarchy
and
those
proclaimed
by
the
assembly
feeling
himself
completely
powerless
the
king
thought
only
of
flight
arrested
at
varennes
and
brought
back
a
prisoner
to
paris
he
was
shut
up
in
the
tuileries
the
assembly
although
still
extremely
royalist
suspended
him
from
power
and
decided
to
assume
the
sole
charge
of
the
government
never
did
sovereign
find
himself
in
a
position
so
difficult
as
that
of
louis
at
the
time
of
his
flight
the
genius
of
a
richelieu
would
hardly
have
extricated
him
the
only
element
of
defence
on
which
he
could
have
relied
had
from
the
beginning
absolutely
failed
him
during
the
whole
duration
of
the
constituent
assembly
the
immense
majority
of
frenchmen
and
of
the
assembly
remained
royalist
so
that
had
the
sovereign
accepted
a
liberal
monarchy
he
could
perhaps
have
remained
in
power
it
would
seem
that
louis
had
little
to
promise
in
order
to
come
to
an
agreement
with
the
assembly
little
perhaps
but
with
his
structure
of
mind
that
little
was
strictly
impossible
all
the
shades
of
his
forbears
would
have
risen
up
in
front
of
him
had
he
consented
to
modify
the
mechanism
of
the
monarchy
inherited
from
so
many
ancestors
and
even
had
he
attempted
to
do
so
the
opposition
of
his
family
the
clergy
the
nobles
and
the
court
could
never
have
been
surmounted
the
ancient
castes
on
which
the
monarchy
rested
the
nobility
and
the
clergy
were
then
almost
as
powerful
as
the
monarch
himself
every
time
it
seemed
as
though
he
might
yield
to
the
injunctions
of
the
assembly
it
was
because
he
was
constrained
to
do
so
by
force
and
to
attempt
to
gain
time
his
appeals
to
alien
powers
represented
the
resolution
of
a
desperate
man
who
had
seen
all
his
natural
defences
fail
him
he
and
especially
the
queen
entertained
the
strangest
illusions
as
to
the
possible
assistance
of
austria
for
centuries
the
rival
of
france
if
austria
indolently
consented
to
come
to
his
aid
it
was
only
in
the
hope
of
receiving
a
great
reward
mercy
gave
him
to
understand
that
the
payment
expected
consisted
of
alsace
the
alps
and
navarre
the
leaders
of
the
clubs
finding
the
assembly
too
royalist
sent
the
people
against
it
a
petition
was
signed
inviting
the
assembly
to
convoke
a
new
constituent
power
to
proceed
to
the
trial
of
louis
xvi
monarchical
in
spite
of
all
and
finding
that
the
revolution
was
assuming
a
character
far
too
demagogic
the
assembly
resolved
to
defend
itself
against
the
actions
of
the
people
a
battalion
of
the
national
guard
commanded
by
la
fayette
was
sent
to
the
where
the
crowd
was
assembled
to
disperse
it
fifty
of
those
present
were
killed
the
assembly
did
not
long
persist
in
its
feeble
resistance
extremely
fearful
of
the
people
it
increased
its
arrogance
towards
the
king
depriving
him
every
day
of
some
part
of
his
prerogatives
and
authority
he
was
now
scarcely
more
than
a
mere
official
obliged
to
execute
the
wishes
of
others
the
assembly
had
imagined
that
it
would
be
able
to
exercise
the
authority
of
which
it
had
deprived
the
king
but
such
a
task
was
infinitely
above
its
resources
a
power
so
divided
is
always
weak
i
know
nothing
more
terrible
said
mirabeau
than
the
sovereign
authority
of
six
hundred
persons
having
flattered
itself
that
it
could
combine
in
itself
all
the
powers
of
the
state
and
exercise
them
as
louis
xvi
had
done
the
assembly
very
soon
exercised
none
whatever
as
its
authority
failed
anarchy
increased
the
popular
leaders
continually
stirred
up
the
people
riot
and
insurrection
became
the
sole
power
every
day
the
assembly
was
invaded
by
rowdy
and
imperious
delegations
which
operated
by
means
of
threats
and
demands
all
these
popular
movements
which
the
assembly
under
the
stress
of
fear
invariably
obeyed
had
nothing
spontaneous
about
them
they
simply
represented
the
manifestations
of
new
powers
the
clubs
and
the
commune
which
had
been
set
up
beside
the
assembly
the
most
powerful
of
these
clubs
was
the
jacobin
which
had
quickly
created
more
than
five
hundred
branches
in
the
country
all
of
which
were
under
the
orders
of
the
central
body
its
influence
remained
preponderant
during
the
whole
duration
of
the
revolution
it
was
the
master
of
the
assembly
and
then
of
france
its
only
rival
the
insurrectionary
commune
whose
power
was
exercised
only
in
paris
the
weakness
of
the
national
assembly
and
all
its
failures
had
made
it
extremely
unpopular
it
became
conscious
of
this
and
feeling
that
it
was
every
day
more
powerless
decided
to
hasten
the
creation
of
the
new
constitution
in
order
that
it
might
dissolve
its
last
action
which
was
tactless
enough
was
to
decree
that
no
member
of
the
constituent
assembly
should
be
elected
to
the
legislative
assembly
the
members
of
the
latter
were
thus
deprived
of
the
experience
acquired
by
their
predecessors
the
constitution
was
completed
on
the
of
september
and
accepted
on
the
by
the
king
to
whom
the
assembly
had
restored
his
powers
this
constitution
organised
a
representative
government
delegating
the
legislative
power
to
deputies
elected
by
the
people
and
the
executive
power
to
the
king
whose
right
of
veto
over
the
decrees
of
the
assembly
was
recognised
new
departmental
divisions
were
substituted
for
the
old
provinces
the
imposts
were
abolished
and
replaced
by
direct
and
indirect
taxes
which
are
still
in
force
the
assembly
which
had
just
altered
the
territorial
divisions
and
overthrown
all
the
old
social
organisation
thought
itself
powerful
enough
to
transform
the
religious
organisation
of
the
country
also
it
claimed
notably
that
the
members
of
the
clergy
should
be
elected
by
the
people
and
should
be
thus
withdrawn
from
the
influence
of
their
supreme
head
the
pope
this
civil
constitution
of
the
clergy
was
the
origin
of
religious
struggles
and
persecutions
which
lasted
until
the
days
of
the
consulate
of
the
priests
refused
the
oath
demanded
of
them
during
the
three
years
which
represented
the
life
of
the
constituent
assembly
the
revolution
had
produced
considerable
results
the
principal
result
was
perhaps
the
beginning
of
the
transference
to
the
third
estate
of
the
riches
of
the
privileged
classes
in
this
way
while
interests
were
created
to
be
defended
fervent
adherents
were
raised
up
to
the
new
regime
a
revolution
supported
by
the
gratification
of
acquired
appetites
is
bound
to
be
powerful
the
third
estate
which
had
supplanted
the
nobles
and
the
peasants
who
had
bought
the
national
domains
would
readily
understand
that
the
restoration
of
the
ancien
regime
would
despoil
them
of
all
their
advantages
the
energetic
defence
of
the
revolution
was
merely
the
defence
of
their
own
fortunes
this
is
why
we
see
during
part
of
the
revolution
nearly
half
the
departments
vainly
rising
against
the
despotism
that
crushed
them
the
republicans
triumphed
over
all
opposition
they
were
extremely
powerful
in
that
they
had
to
defend
not
only
a
new
ideal
but
new
material
interests
we
shall
see
that
the
influence
of
these
two
factors
lasted
during
the
whole
of
the
revolution
and
contributed
powerfully
to
the
establishment
of
the
empire
chapter
ii
the
psychology
of
the
legislative
assembly
political
events
during
the
life
of
the
legislative
assembly
before
examining
the
mental
characteristics
of
the
legislative
assembly
let
us
briefly
sum
up
the
considerable
political
events
which
marked
its
short
year
life
they
naturally
played
an
important
part
in
respect
of
its
psychological
manifestations
extremely
monarchical
the
legislative
assembly
had
no
more
idea
than
its
predecessor
of
destroying
the
monarchy
the
king
appeared
to
it
to
be
slightly
suspect
but
it
still
hoped
to
be
able
to
retain
him
on
the
throne
unhappily
for
him
louis
was
incessantly
begging
for
intervention
from
abroad
shut
up
in
the
tuileries
defended
only
by
his
swiss
guards
the
timid
sovereign
was
drifting
among
contrary
influences
he
subsidised
journals
intended
to
modify
public
opinion
but
the
obscure
who
edited
them
knew
nothing
of
acting
on
the
mind
of
the
crowd
their
only
means
of
persuasion
was
to
menace
with
the
gallows
all
the
partisans
of
the
revolution
and
to
predict
the
invasion
of
france
by
an
army
which
would
rescue
the
king
royalty
no
longer
counted
on
anything
but
the
foreign
courts
the
nobles
were
emigrating
prussia
austria
and
russia
were
threatening
france
with
a
war
of
invasion
the
court
favoured
their
lead
to
the
coalition
of
the
three
kings
against
france
the
jacobin
club
proposed
to
oppose
a
league
of
peoples
the
girondists
were
then
with
the
jacobins
at
the
head
of
the
revolutionary
movement
they
incited
the
masses
to
arm
themselves
volunteers
were
equipped
the
court
accepted
a
girondist
minister
dominated
by
him
louis
xvi
was
obliged
to
propose
to
the
assembly
a
war
against
austria
it
was
immediately
agreed
to
in
declaring
war
the
king
was
not
sincere
the
queen
revealed
the
french
plans
of
campaign
and
the
secret
deliberations
of
the
council
to
the
austrians
the
beginnings
of
the
struggle
were
disastrous
several
columns
of
troops
attacked
by
panic
disbanded
stimulated
by
the
clubs
and
persuaded
justly
for
that
matter
that
the
king
was
conspiring
with
the
enemies
of
france
the
population
of
the
faubourgs
rose
in
insurrection
its
leaders
the
jacobins
and
above
all
danton
sent
to
the
tuileries
on
the
of
june
a
petition
threatening
the
king
with
revocation
it
then
invaded
the
tuileries
heaping
invectives
on
the
sovereign
fatality
impelled
louis
toward
his
tragic
destiny
while
the
threats
of
the
jacobins
against
royalty
had
roused
many
of
the
departments
to
indignation
it
was
learned
that
a
prussian
army
had
arrived
on
the
frontiers
of
lorraine
the
hope
of
the
king
and
queen
respecting
the
help
to
be
obtained
from
abroad
was
highly
chimerical
suffered
from
an
absolute
illusion
as
to
the
psychology
of
the
austrian
and
the
french
peoples
seeing
france
terrorised
by
a
few
energumens
she
supposed
that
it
would
be
equally
easy
to
terrify
the
parisians
and
by
means
of
threats
to
lead
them
back
under
the
king
authority
inspired
by
her
fersen
undertook
to
publish
the
manifesto
of
the
duke
of
brunswick
threatening
paris
with
total
subversion
if
the
royal
family
were
molested
the
effect
produced
was
diametrically
opposite
to
that
intended
the
manifesto
aroused
indignation
against
the
monarch
who
was
regarded
as
an
accomplice
and
increased
his
unpopularity
from
that
day
he
was
marked
for
the
scaffold
carried
away
by
danton
the
delegates
of
the
sections
installed
themselves
at
the
hotel
de
ville
as
an
insurrectionary
commune
which
arrested
the
commandant
of
the
national
guard
who
was
devoted
to
the
king
sounded
the
tocsin
equipped
the
national
guard
and
on
the
of
august
hurled
them
with
the
populace
against
the
tuileries
the
regiments
called
in
by
louis
disbanded
themselves
soon
none
were
left
to
defend
him
but
his
swiss
and
a
few
gentlemen
nearly
all
were
killed
left
alone
the
king
took
refuge
with
the
assembly
the
crowds
demanded
his
denouncement
the
legislative
assembly
decreed
his
suspension
and
left
a
future
assembly
the
convention
to
decide
upon
his
fate
mental
characteristics
of
the
legislative
assembly
the
legislative
assembly
formed
of
new
men
presented
quite
a
special
interest
from
the
psychological
point
of
view
few
assemblies
have
offered
in
such
a
degree
the
characteristics
of
the
political
collectivity
it
comprised
seven
hundred
and
fifty
deputies
divided
into
pure
royalists
constitutional
royalists
republicans
girondists
and
montagnards
advocates
and
men
of
letters
formed
the
majority
it
also
contained
but
in
smaller
numbers
superior
officers
priests
and
a
very
few
scientists
the
philosophical
conceptions
of
the
members
of
this
assembly
seem
rudimentary
enough
many
were
imbued
with
rousseau
idea
of
a
return
to
a
state
of
nature
but
all
like
their
predecessors
were
dominated
more
especially
by
recollections
of
greek
and
latin
antiquity
cato
brutus
gracchus
plutarch
marcus
aurelius
and
plato
continually
evoked
furnished
the
images
of
their
speech
when
the
orator
wished
to
insult
louis
xvi
he
called
him
caligula
in
hoping
to
destroy
tradition
they
were
revolutionaries
but
in
claiming
to
return
to
a
remote
past
they
showed
themselves
extremely
reactionary
for
the
rest
all
these
theories
had
very
little
influence
on
their
conduct
reason
was
continually
figuring
in
their
speeches
but
never
in
their
actions
these
were
always
dominated
by
those
affective
and
mystic
elements
whose
potency
we
have
so
often
demonstrated
the
psychological
characteristics
of
the
legislative
assembly
were
those
of
the
constituent
assembly
but
were
greatly
accentuated
they
may
be
summed
up
in
four
words
impressionability
mobility
timidity
and
weakness
this
mobility
and
impressionability
are
revealed
in
the
constant
variability
of
their
conduct
one
day
they
exchange
noisy
invective
and
blows
on
the
following
day
we
see
them
throwing
themselves
into
one
another
arms
with
torrents
of
tears
they
eagerly
applaud
an
address
demanding
the
punishment
of
those
who
have
petitioned
for
the
king
dethronement
and
the
same
day
accord
the
honours
of
the
session
to
a
delegation
which
has
come
to
demand
his
downfall
the
pusillanimity
and
weakness
of
the
assembly
in
the
face
of
threats
was
extreme
although
royalist
it
voted
the
suspension
of
the
king
and
on
the
demand
of
the
commune
delivered
him
with
his
family
to
be
imprisoned
in
the
temple
thanks
to
its
weakness
it
was
as
incapable
as
the
constituent
assembly
of
exercising
any
power
and
allowed
itself
to
be
dominated
by
the
commune
and
the
clubs
which
were
directed
by
such
influential
leaders
as
hebert
tallien
rossignol
marat
robespierre
until
thermidor
the
insurrectionary
commune
constituted
the
chief
power
in
the
state
and
behaved
precisely
as
if
it
had
been
charged
with
the
government
of
paris
it
was
the
commune
that
demanded
the
imprisonment
of
louis
xvi
in
the
tower
of
the
temple
when
the
assembly
wished
to
imprison
him
in
the
palace
of
the
luxembourg
it
was
the
commune
again
that
filled
the
prisons
with
suspects
and
then
ordered
them
to
be
killed
we
know
with
what
refinements
of
cruelty
a
handful
of
some
bandits
paid
at
the
rate
of
livres
a
day
and
directed
by
a
few
members
of
the
commune
exterminated
some
persons
in
four
days
this
crime
was
known
as
the
massacre
of
september
the
mayor
of
paris
petion
received
the
band
of
assassins
with
respect
and
gave
them
drink
a
few
girondists
protested
somewhat
but
the
jacobins
were
silent
the
terrorised
assembly
affected
at
first
to
ignore
the
massacres
which
were
encouraged
by
several
of
its
more
influential
deputies
notably
couthon
and
when
at
last
it
decided
to
condemn
them
it
was
without
attempting
to
prevent
their
continuation
conscious
of
its
impotence
the
legislative
assembly
dissolved
itself
a
fortnight
later
in
order
to
give
way
to
the
convention
its
work
was
obviously
disastrous
not
in
intention
but
in
fact
royalist
it
abandoned
the
monarchy
humanitarian
it
allowed
the
massacres
of
september
pacific
it
pushed
france
into
a
formidable
war
thus
showing
that
a
weak
government
always
ends
by
bringing
ruin
upon
its
country
the
history
of
the
two
previous
revolutionary
assemblies
proves
once
more
to
what
point
events
carry
within
them
their
inevitable
consequences
they
constitute
a
train
of
necessities
of
which
we
can
sometimes
choose
the
first
but
which
then
evolve
without
consulting
us
we
are
free
to
make
a
decision
but
powerless
to
avert
its
consequences
the
first
measures
of
the
constituent
assembly
were
rational
and
voluntary
but
the
results
which
followed
were
beyond
all
will
or
reason
or
foresight
which
of
the
men
of
would
have
ventured
to
desire
or
predict
the
death
of
louis
the
wars
of
la
vendee
the
terror
the
permanent
guillotine
and
the
final
anarchy
or
the
ensuing
return
to
tradition
and
order
guided
by
the
iron
hand
of
a
soldier
in
the
development
of
events
which
ensued
from
the
early
actions
of
the
revolutionary
assemblies
the
most
striking
perhaps
was
the
rise
and
development
of
the
government
of
the
crowd
of
mob
rule
behind
the
facts
which
we
have
been
considering
the
taking
of
the
bastille
the
invasion
of
versailles
the
massacres
of
september
the
attack
on
the
tuileries
the
murder
of
the
swiss
guards
and
the
downfall
and
imprisonment
of
the
king
we
can
readily
perceive
the
laws
affecting
the
psychology
of
crowds
and
their
leaders
we
shall
now
see
that
the
power
of
the
multitude
will
progressively
increase
overcome
all
other
powers
and
finally
replace
them
chapter
iii
the
psychology
of
the
convention
the
legend
of
the
convention
the
history
of
the
convention
is
not
merely
fertile
in
psychological
documents
it
also
shows
how
powerless
the
witnesses
of
any
period
and
even
their
immediate
successors
are
to
form
an
exact
idea
of
the
events
which
they
have
witnessed
and
the
men
who
have
surrounded
them
more
than
a
century
has
elapsed
since
the
revolution
and
men
are
only
just
beginning
to
form
judgments
concerning
this
period
which
if
still
often
doubtful
enough
are
slightly
more
accurate
than
of
old
this
happens
not
only
because
new
documents
are
being
drawn
from
the
archives
but
because
the
legends
which
enveloped
that
sanguinary
period
in
a
magical
cloud
are
gradually
vanishing
with
the
passage
of
time
perhaps
the
most
tenacious
legend
of
all
was
that
which
until
formerly
used
to
surround
the
personages
to
whom
our
fathers
applied
the
glorious
epithet
the
giants
of
the
convention
the
struggles
of
the
convention
against
france
in
insurrection
and
europe
in
arms
produced
such
an
impression
that
the
heroes
of
this
formidable
struggle
seemed
to
belong
to
a
race
of
supermen
or
titans
the
epithet
giant
seemed
justified
so
long
as
the
events
of
the
period
were
confused
and
massed
together
regarded
as
connected
when
it
was
simply
simultaneous
the
work
of
the
armies
was
confounded
with
that
of
the
convention
the
glory
of
the
first
recoiled
upon
the
second
and
served
as
an
excuse
for
the
hecatombs
of
the
terror
the
ferocity
of
the
civil
war
and
the
devastation
of
france
under
the
penetrating
scrutiny
of
modern
criticism
the
heterogeneous
mass
of
events
has
been
slowly
disentangled
the
armies
of
the
republic
have
retained
their
old
prestige
but
we
have
been
forced
to
recognise
that
the
men
of
the
convention
absorbed
entirely
by
their
intestine
conflicts
had
very
little
to
do
with
their
victories
at
the
most
two
or
three
members
of
the
committees
of
the
assembly
were
concerned
with
the
armies
and
the
fact
that
they
were
victorious
was
due
apart
from
their
numbers
and
the
talents
of
their
young
generals
to
the
enthusiasm
with
which
a
new
faith
had
inspired
them
in
a
later
chapter
devoted
to
the
revolutionary
armies
we
shall
see
how
they
conquered
europe
in
arms
they
set
out
inspired
by
the
ideas
of
liberty
and
equality
which
constituted
the
new
gospel
and
once
on
the
frontiers
which
were
to
keep
them
so
long
they
retained
a
special
mentality
very
different
from
that
of
the
government
which
they
first
knew
nothing
of
and
afterwards
despised
having
no
part
whatever
in
their
victories
the
men
of
the
convention
contented
themselves
with
legislating
at
hazard
according
to
the
injunctions
of
the
leaders
who
directed
them
and
who
claimed
to
be
regenerating
france
by
means
of
the
guillotine
but
it
was
thanks
to
these
valiant
armies
that
the
history
of
the
convention
was
transformed
into
an
apotheosis
which
affected
several
generations
with
a
religious
respect
which
even
is
hardly
extinct
studying
in
detail
the
psychology
of
the
giants
of
the
convention
we
find
their
magnitude
shrink
very
rapidly
they
were
in
general
extremely
mediocre
their
most
fervent
defenders
such
as
aulard
are
obliged
to
admit
as
much
this
is
how
aulard
puts
it
in
his
history
of
the
french
revolution
it
has
been
said
that
the
generation
which
from
to
did
such
great
and
terrible
things
was
a
generation
of
giants
or
to
put
it
more
plainly
that
it
was
a
generation
more
distinguished
than
that
which
preceded
it
or
that
which
followed
this
is
a
retrospective
illusion
the
citizens
who
formed
the
municipal
and
jacobin
or
nationalist
groups
by
which
the
revolution
was
effected
do
not
seem
to
have
been
superior
either
in
enlightenment
or
in
talents
to
the
frenchmen
of
the
time
of
louis
xv
or
of
louis
philippe
were
those
exceptionally
gifted
whose
names
history
has
retained
because
they
appeared
on
the
stage
of
paris
or
because
they
were
the
most
brilliant
orators
of
the
various
revolutionary
assemblies
mirabeau
up
to
a
certain
point
deserved
the
title
of
genius
but
as
to
the
rest
robespierre
danton
vergniaud
had
they
truly
more
talent
for
example
than
our
modern
orators
in
in
the
time
of
the
supposed
mme
roland
wrote
in
her
memoirs
was
as
though
drained
of
men
their
dearth
during
this
revolution
is
truly
surprising
there
have
scarcely
been
any
but
pigmies
if
after
considering
the
men
of
the
convention
individually
we
consider
them
in
a
body
we
may
say
that
they
did
not
shine
either
by
intelligence
or
by
virtue
or
by
courage
never
did
a
body
of
men
manifest
such
pusillanimity
they
had
no
courage
save
in
their
speeches
or
in
respect
of
remote
dangers
this
assembly
so
proud
and
threatening
in
its
speech
when
addressing
royalty
was
perhaps
the
most
timid
and
docile
political
collectivity
that
the
world
has
ever
known
we
see
it
slavishly
obedient
to
the
orders
of
the
clubs
and
the
commune
trembling
before
the
popular
delegations
which
invaded
it
daily
and
obeying
the
injunctions
of
the
rioters
to
the
point
of
handing
over
to
them
its
most
brilliant
members
the
convention
affords
the
world
a
melancholy
spectacle
voting
at
the
popular
behest
laws
so
absurd
that
it
is
obliged
to
annul
them
as
soon
as
the
rioters
have
quitted
the
hall
few
assemblies
have
given
proof
of
such
weakness
when
we
wish
to
show
how
low
a
popular
government
can
fall
we
have
only
to
point
to
the
convention
results
of
the
triumph
of
the
jacobin
religion
among
the
causes
that
gave
the
convention
its
special
physiognomy
one
of
the
most
important
was
the
definite
establishment
of
a
revolutionary
religion
a
dogma
which
was
at
first
in
process
of
formation
was
at
last
finally
erected
this
dogma
was
composed
of
an
aggregate
of
somewhat
inconsistent
elements
nature
the
rights
of
man
liberty
equality
the
social
contract
hatred
of
tyrants
and
popular
sovereignty
formed
the
articles
of
a
gospel
which
to
its
disciples
was
above
discussion
the
new
truths
had
found
apostles
who
were
certain
of
their
power
and
who
finally
like
believers
all
the
world
over
sought
to
impose
them
by
force
no
heed
should
be
taken
of
the
opinion
of
unbelievers
they
all
deserved
to
be
exterminated
the
hatred
of
heretics
having
been
always
as
we
have
seen
in
respect
of
the
reformation
an
irreducible
characteristic
of
great
beliefs
we
can
readily
comprehend
the
intolerance
of
the
jacobin
religion
the
history
of
the
reformation
proves
also
that
the
conflict
between
two
allied
beliefs
is
very
bitter
we
must
not
therefore
be
astonished
that
in
the
convention
the
jacobins
fought
furiously
against
the
other
republicans
whose
faith
hardly
differed
from
their
own
the
propaganda
of
the
new
apostles
was
very
energetic
to
convert
the
provinces
they
sent
thither
zealous
disciples
escorted
by
guillotines
the
inquisitors
of
the
new
faith
would
have
no
paltering
with
error
as
robespierre
said
the
republic
is
the
destruction
of
everything
that
is
opposed
to
it
what
matter
that
the
country
refused
to
be
regenerated
it
should
be
regenerated
despite
itself
we
will
make
a
cemetery
of
france
said
carrier
rather
than
fail
to
regenerate
it
in
our
own
way
the
jacobin
policy
derived
from
the
new
faith
was
very
simple
it
consisted
in
a
sort
of
equalitarian
socialism
directed
by
a
dictatorship
which
would
brook
no
opposition
of
practical
ideas
consistent
with
the
economic
necessities
and
the
true
nature
of
man
the
theorists
who
ruled
france
would
have
nothing
to
say
speech
and
the
guillotine
sufficed
them
their
speeches
were
childish
never
a
fact
says
taine
nothing
but
abstractions
strings
of
sentences
about
nature
reason
the
people
tyrants
liberty
like
so
many
balloons
uselessly
jostling
in
space
if
we
did
not
know
that
it
all
ended
in
practical
and
dreadful
results
we
should
think
they
were
games
of
logic
school
exercises
academical
demonstrations
ideological
combinations
the
theories
of
the
jacobins
amounted
practically
to
an
absolute
tyranny
to
them
it
seemed
evident
that
a
sovereign
state
must
be
obeyed
without
discussion
by
citizens
rendered
equal
as
to
conditions
and
fortune
the
power
with
which
they
invested
themselves
was
far
greater
than
that
of
the
monarchs
who
had
preceded
them
they
fixed
the
prices
of
merchandise
and
arrogated
the
right
to
dispose
of
the
life
and
property
of
citizens
their
confidence
in
the
regenerative
virtues
of
the
revolutionary
faith
was
such
that
after
having
declared
war
upon
kings
they
declared
war
upon
the
gods
a
calendar
was
established
from
which
the
saints
were
banished
they
created
a
new
divinity
reason
whose
worship
was
celebrated
in
with
ceremonies
which
were
in
many
ways
identical
with
those
of
the
catholic
faith
upon
the
altar
of
the
late
holy
virgin
this
cult
lasted
until
robespierre
substituted
a
personal
religion
of
which
he
constituted
himself
the
high
priest
the
sole
masters
of
france
the
jacobins
and
their
disciples
were
able
to
plunder
the
country
with
impunity
although
they
were
never
in
the
majority
anywhere
their
numbers
are
not
easy
to
determine
exactly
we
know
only
that
they
were
very
small
taine
valued
them
at
in
paris
among
inhabitants
in
besancon
among
and
in
all
france
about
a
small
feudality
of
brigands
set
over
a
conquered
france
according
to
the
words
of
the
same
author
they
were
able
in
spite
of
their
small
numbers
to
dominate
the
country
and
this
for
several
reasons
in
the
first
place
their
faith
gave
them
a
considerable
strength
then
because
they
represented
the
government
and
for
centuries
the
french
had
obeyed
those
who
were
in
command
finally
because
it
was
believed
that
to
overthrow
them
would
be
to
bring
back
the
ancien
regime
which
was
greatly
dreaded
by
the
numerous
purchasers
of
the
national
domains
their
tyranny
must
have
grown
frightful
indeed
to
force
so
many
departments
to
rise
against
them
the
first
factor
of
their
power
was
very
important
in
the
conflict
between
powerful
faiths
and
weak
faiths
victory
never
falls
to
the
latter
a
powerful
faith
creates
strong
wills
which
will
always
overpower
weak
wills
that
the
jacobins
themselves
did
finally
perish
was
because
their
accumulated
violence
had
bound
together
thousands
of
weak
wills
whose
united
weight
overbalanced
their
own
strong
wills
it
is
true
that
the
girondists
whom
the
jacobins
persecuted
with
so
much
hatred
had
also
beliefs
but
in
the
struggle
which
ensued
their
education
told
against
them
together
with
their
respect
for
certain
traditions
and
the
rights
of
others
scruples
which
did
not
in
the
least
trouble
their
adversaries
the
majority
of
the
sentiments
of
the
girondists
writes
emile
ollivier
were
delicate
and
generous
those
of
the
jacobin
mob
were
low
gross
and
brutal
the
name
of
vergniaud
compared
with
that
of
the
marat
measures
a
gulf
which
nothing
could
span
dominating
the
convention
at
the
outset
by
the
superiority
of
their
talents
and
their
eloquence
the
girondists
soon
fell
under
the
domination
of
the
montagnards
worthless
energumens
who
carried
little
weight
but
were
always
active
and
who
knew
how
to
excite
the
passions
of
the
populace
it
was
violence
and
not
talent
that
impressed
the
assemblies
mental
characteristics
of
the
convention
beside
the
characteristics
common
to
all
assemblies
there
are
some
created
by
influences
of
environment
and
circumstances
which
give
any
particular
assembly
of
men
a
special
physiognomy
most
of
the
characteristics
observable
in
the
constituent
and
legislative
assemblies
reappeared
in
an
exaggerated
form
in
the
convention
this
assembly
comprised
about
seven
hundred
and
fifty
deputies
of
whom
rather
more
than
a
third
had
sat
in
the
constituent
or
the
legislative
assembly
by
terrorising
the
population
the
jacobins
contrived
to
triumph
at
the
elections
the
majority
of
the
electors
six
millions
out
of
seven
preferred
to
abstain
from
voting
as
to
the
professions
the
assembly
contained
a
large
number
of
lawyers
advocates
notaries
bailiffs
and
a
few
literary
men
the
mentality
of
the
convention
was
not
homogeneous
now
an
assembly
composed
of
individuals
of
widely
different
characters
soon
splits
up
into
a
number
of
groups
the
convention
very
early
contained
three
the
gironde
the
mountain
and
the
plain
the
constitutional
monarchists
had
almost
disappeared
the
gironde
and
the
mountain
extreme
parties
consisted
of
about
a
hundred
members
apiece
who
successively
became
leaders
in
the
mountain

most
advanced

the
five
hundred
other
members
of
the
assembly
that
is
the
great
majority
constituted
what
was
known
as
the
plain
this
latter
formed
a
floating
mass
silent
undecided
and
timid
ready
to
follow
every
impulse
and
to
be
carried
away
by
the
excitement
of
the
moment
it
gave
ear
indifferently
to
the
stronger
of
the
two
preceding
groups
after
obeying
the
gironde
for
some
time
it
allowed
itself
to
be
led
away
by
the
mountain
when
the
latter
triumphed
over
its
enemy
this
was
a
natural
consequence
of
the
law
already
stated
by
which
the
weak
invariably
fall
under
the
dominion
of
the
stronger
wills
the
influence
of
great
manipulators
of
men
was
displayed
in
a
high
degree
during
the
convention
it
was
constantly
led
by
a
violent
minority
of
narrow
minds
whose
intense
convictions
lent
them
great
strength
a
brutal
and
audacious
minority
will
always
lead
a
fearful
and
irresolute
majority
this
explains
the
constant
tendency
toward
extremes
to
be
observed
in
all
revolutionary
assemblies
the
history
of
the
convention
verifies
once
more
the
law
of
acceleration
studied
in
another
chapter
the
men
of
the
convention
were
thus
bound
to
pass
from
moderation
to
greater
and
greater
violence
finally
they
decimated
themselves
of
the
girondists
who
at
the
outset
led
the
convention
were
killed
or
fled
and
finally
the
most
fanatical
of
the
terrorists
robespierre
reigned
alone
over
a
terrified
crowd
of
servile
representatives
yet
it
was
among
the
five
hundred
members
of
the
majority
uncertain
and
floating
as
it
was
that
the
intelligence
and
experience
were
to
be
found
the
technical
committees
to
whom
the
useful
work
of
the
convention
was
due
were
recruited
from
the
plain
more
or
less
indifferent
to
politics
the
members
of
the
plain
were
chiefly
anxious
that
no
one
should
pay
particular
attention
to
them
shut
up
in
their
committees
they
showed
themselves
as
little
as
possible
in
the
assembly
which
explains
why
the
sessions
of
the
convention
contained
barely
a
third
of
the
deputies
unhappily
as
often
happens
these
intelligent
and
honest
men
were
completely
devoid
of
character
and
the
fear
which
always
dominated
them
made
them
vote
for
the
worst
of
the
measures
introduced
by
their
dreaded
masters
the
men
of
the
plain
voted
for
everything
they
were
ordered
to
vote
for
the
creation
of
the
revolutionary
tribunal
the
terror
it
was
with
their
assistance
that
the
mountain
crushed
the
gironde
and
robespierre
destroyed
the
hebertists
and
dantonists
like
all
weak
people
they
followed
the
strong
the
gentle
philanthropists
who
composed
the
plain
and
constituted
the
majority
of
the
assembly
contributed
by
their
pusillanimity
to
bring
about
the
frightful
excesses
of
the
convention
the
psychological
note
always
prevailing
in
the
convention
was
a
horrible
fear
it
was
more
especially
through
fear
that
men
cut
off
one
another
heads
in
the
doubtful
hope
of
keeping
their
own
on
their
shoulders
such
a
fear
was
of
course
very
comprehensible
the
unhappy
deputies
deliberated
amid
the
hootings
and
vociferations
of
the
tribunes
at
every
moment
veritable
savages
armed
with
pikes
invaded
the
assembly
and
the
majority
of
the
members
no
longer
dared
to
attend
the
sessions
when
by
chance
they
did
go
it
was
only
to
vote
in
silence
according
to
the
orders
of
the
mountain
which
was
only
a
third
as
numerous
the
fear
which
dominated
the
latter
although
less
visible
was
just
as
profound
men
destroyed
their
enemies
not
only
because
they
were
shallow
fanatics
but
because
they
were
convinced
that
their
own
existence
was
threatened
the
judges
of
the
revolutionary
tribunals
trembled
no
less
they
would
have
willingly
acquitted
danton
and
the
widow
of
camille
desmoulins
and
many
others
they
dared
not
but
it
was
above
all
when
robespierre
became
the
sole
master
that
the
phantom
of
fear
oppressed
the
assembly
it
has
truly
been
said
that
a
glance
from
the
master
made
his
colleagues
shrink
with
fear
on
their
faces
one
read
the
pallor
of
fear
and
the
abandon
of
despair
all
feared
robespierre
and
robespierre
feared
all
it
was
because
he
feared
conspiracies
against
him
that
he
cut
off
heads
and
it
was
also
through
fear
that
others
allowed
him
to
do
so
the
memoirs
of
members
of
the
convention
show
plainly
what
a
horrible
memory
they
retained
of
this
gloomy
period
questioned
twenty
years
later
says
taine
on
the
true
aim
and
the
intimate
thoughts
of
the
committee
of
public
safety
barrere
replied
we
had
only
one
feeling
that
of
only
one
desire
that
of
preserving
our
lives
which
each
of
us
believed
to
be
threatened
you
had
your
neighbour
head
cut
off
so
that
your
neighbour
should
not
have
you
yourself
guillotined
the
history
of
the
convention
constitutes
one
of
the
most
striking
examples
that
could
be
given
of
the
influence
of
leaders
and
of
fear
upon
an
assembly
chapter
iv
the
government
of
the
convention
the
activity
of
the
clubs
and
the
commune
during
the
convention
during
the
whole
of
its
existence
the
convention
was
governed
by
the
leaders
of
the
clubs
and
of
the
commune
we
have
already
seen
what
was
their
influence
on
the
preceding
assemblies
it
became
overwhelming
during
the
convention
the
history
of
this
latter
is
in
reality
that
of
the
clubs
and
the
commune
which
dominated
it
they
enslaved
not
only
the
convention
but
also
all
france
numerous
little
provincial
clubs
directed
by
that
of
the
capital
supervised
magistrates
denounced
suspects
and
undertook
the
execution
of
all
the
revolutionary
orders
when
the
clubs
or
the
commune
had
decided
upon
certain
measures
they
had
them
voted
by
the
assembly
then
and
there
if
the
assembly
resisted
they
sent
their
armed
delegations
thither
that
is
armed
bands
recruited
from
the
scum
of
the
populace
they
conveyed
injunctions
which
were
always
slavishly
obeyed
the
commune
was
so
sure
of
its
strength
that
it
even
demanded
of
the
convention
the
immediate
expulsion
of
deputies
who
displeased
it
while
the
convention
was
composed
generally
of
educated
men
the
members
of
the
commune
and
the
clubs
comprised
a
majority
of
small
shopkeepers
labourers
and
artisans
incapable
of
personal
opinions
and
always
guided
by
their
leaders
danton
camille
desmoulins
robespierre
of
the
two
powers
clubs
and
insurrectionary
commune
the
latter
exercised
the
greater
influence
in
paris
because
it
had
made
for
itself
a
revolutionary
army
it
held
under
its
orders
eight
committees
of
national
guards
who
asked
nothing
more
than
to
kill
sack
and
above
all
plunder
the
tyranny
with
which
the
commune
crushed
paris
was
frightful
for
example
it
delegated
to
a
certain
cobbler
chalandon
by
name
the
right
of
surveillance
over
a
portion
of
the
capital
a
right
implying
the
power
to
send
to
the
revolutionary
tribunal
and
therefore
to
the
guillotine
all
those
whom
he
suspected
certain
streets
were
thus
almost
depopulated
by
him
the
convention
struggled
feebly
against
the
commune
at
the
outset
but
did
not
prolong
its
resistance
the
culminating
point
of
the
conflict
occurred
when
the
convention
wished
to
arrest
hebert
the
friend
of
the
commune
and
the
latter
sent
armed
bands
who
threatened
the
assembly
and
demanded
the
expulsion
of
the
girondists
who
had
provoked
the
measure
upon
the
convention
refusing
the
commune
besieged
it
on
june
by
means
of
its
revolutionary
army
which
was
under
the
orders
of
hanriot
terrified
the
assembly
gave
up
of
its
members
the
commune
immediately
sent
a
delegation
ironically
to
felicitate
it
upon
its
obedience
after
the
fall
of
the
girondists
the
convention
submitted
itself
completely
to
the
injunctions
of
the
omnipotent
commune
the
latter
decreed
the
levy
of
a
revolutionary
army
to
be
accompanied
by
a
tribunal
and
a
guillotine
which
was
to
traverse
the
whole
of
france
in
order
to
execute
suspects
only
towards
the
end
of
its
existence
after
the
fall
of
robespierre
did
the
convention
contrive
to
escape
from
the
yoke
of
the
jacobins
and
the
commune
it
closed
the
jacobin
club
and
guillotined
its
leading
members
despite
such
sanctions
the
leaders
still
continued
to
excite
the
populace
and
hurl
it
against
the
convention
in
germinal
and
prairial
it
underwent
regular
sieges
armed
delegations
even
succeeded
in
forcing
the
convention
to
vote
the
of
the
commune
and
the
convocation
of
a
new
assembly
a
measure
which
the
convention
hastened
to
annul
the
moment
the
insurgents
had
withdrawn
ashamed
of
its
fear
it
sent
for
regiments
which
disarmed
the
faubourgs
and
made
nearly
ten
thousand
arrests
leaders
of
the
movement
were
put
to
death
and
six
deputies
who
were
concerned
in
the
riot
were
guillotined
but
the
convention
did
not
resist
to
any
purpose
when
it
was
no
longer
led
by
the
clubs
and
the
commune
it
obeyed
the
committee
of
public
safety
and
voted
its
decrees
without
discussion
the
convention
writes
williams
which
spoke
of
nothing
less
than
having
all
the
princes
and
kings
of
europe
brought
to
its
feet
loaded
with
chains
was
made
prisoner
in
its
own
sanctuary
by
a
handful
of
mercenaries
the
government
of
france
during
the
convention
the
terror
as
soon
as
it
assembled
in
the
convention
began
by
decreeing
the
abolition
of
royalty
and
in
spite
of
the
hesitation
of
a
great
number
of
its
members
who
knew
that
the
provinces
were
royalist
it
proclaimed
the
republic
intimately
persuaded
that
such
a
proclamation
would
transform
the
civilised
world
it
instituted
a
new
era
and
a
new
calendar
the
year
of
this
era
marked
the
dawn
of
a
world
in
which
reason
alone
was
to
reign
it
was
inaugurated
by
the
trial
of
louis
a
measure
which
was
ordered
by
the
commune
but
which
the
majority
of
the
convention
did
not
desire
at
its
outset
in
fact
the
convention
was
governed
by
its
relatively
moderate
elements
the
girondists
the
president
and
the
secretaries
had
been
chosen
among
the
best
known
of
this
party
robespierre
who
was
later
to
become
the
absolute
master
of
the
convention
possessed
so
little
influence
at
this
time
that
he
obtained
only
six
votes
for
the
presidency
while
petion
received
two
hundred
and
the
montagnards
had
at
first
only
a
very
slight
influence
their
power
was
of
later
growth
when
they
were
in
power
there
was
no
longer
room
in
the
convention
for
moderate
members
despite
their
minority
the
montagnards
found
a
way
to
force
the
assembly
to
bring
louis
to
trial
this
was
at
once
a
victory
over
the
girondists
the
condemnation
of
all
kings
and
a
final
divorce
between
the
old
order
and
the
new
to
bring
about
the
trial
they
manoeuvred
very
skilfully
bombarding
the
convention
with
petitions
from
the
provinces
and
sending
a
deputation
from
the
insurrectional
commune
of
paris
which
demanded
a
trial
according
to
a
characteristic
common
to
the
assemblies
of
the
revolution
that
of
yielding
to
threats
and
always
doing
the
contrary
of
what
they
wished
the
men
of
the
convention
dared
not
resist
the
trial
was
decided
upon
the
girondists
who
individually
would
not
have
wished
for
the
death
of
the
king
voted
for
it
out
of
fear
once
they
were
assembled
hoping
to
save
his
own
head
the
duc
louis
cousin
voted
with
them
if
on
mounting
the
scaffold
on
january
louis
had
had
that
vision
of
the
future
which
we
attribute
to
the
gods
he
would
have
seen
following
him
one
by
one
the
greater
number
of
the
girondists
whose
weakness
had
been
unable
to
defend
him
regarded
only
from
the
purely
utilitarian
point
of
view
the
execution
of
the
king
was
one
of
the
mistakes
of
the
revolution
it
engendered
civil
war
and
armed
europe
against
france
in
the
convention
itself
his
death
gave
rise
to
intestine
struggles
which
finally
led
to
the
triumph
of
the
montagnards
and
the
expulsion
of
the
girondists
the
measures
passed
under
the
influence
of
the
montagnards
finally
became
so
despotic
that
sixty
departments
comprising
the
west
and
the
south
revolted
the
insurrection
which
was
headed
by
many
of
the
expelled
deputies
would
perhaps
have
succeeded
had
not
the
compromising
assistance
of
the
royalists
caused
men
to
fear
the
return
of
the
ancien
regime
at
toulon
in
fact
the
insurgents
acclaimed
louis
xvii
the
civil
war
thus
begun
lasted
during
the
greater
part
of
the
life
of
the
revolution
it
was
fought
with
the
utmost
savagery
old
men
women
children
all
were
massacred
and
villages
and
crops
were
burned
in
the
vendee
alone
the
number
of
the
killed
was
reckoned
at
something
between
half
a
million
and
a
million
civil
war
was
soon
followed
by
foreign
war
the
jacobins
thought
to
remedy
all
these
ills
by
creating
a
new
constitution
it
was
always
a
tradition
with
all
the
revolutionary
assemblies
to
believe
in
the
magic
virtues
of
formula
in
france
this
conviction
has
never
been
affected
by
the
failure
of
experiments
a
robust
faith
writes
one
of
the
great
admirers
of
the
revolution
rambaud
sustained
the
convention
in
this
labour
it
believed
firmly
that
when
it
had
formulated
in
a
law
the
principles
of
the
revolution
its
enemies
would
be
confounded
or
still
better
converted
and
that
the
advent
of
justice
would
disarm
the
insurgents
during
its
lifetime
the
convention
drafted
two
constitutions
that
of
or
the
year
and
that
of
or
the
year
iii
the
first
was
never
applied
an
absolute
dictatorship
very
soon
replacing
it
the
second
created
the
directory
the
convention
contained
a
large
number
of
lawyers
and
men
of
affairs
who
promptly
comprehended
the
impossibility
of
government
by
means
of
a
large
assembly
they
soon
divided
the
convention
into
small
committees
each
of
which
had
an
independent
existence
business
committees
committees
of
legislation
finance
agriculture
arts
these
committees
prepared
the
laws
which
the
assembly
usually
voted
with
its
eyes
closed
thanks
to
them
the
work
of
the
convention
was
not
purely
destructive
they
drafted
many
very
useful
measures
creating
important
colleges
establishing
the
metric
system
the
majority
of
the
members
of
the
assembly
as
we
have
already
seen
took
refuge
in
these
committees
in
order
to
evade
the
political
conflict
which
would
have
endangered
their
heads
above
the
business
committees
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
politics
was
the
committee
of
public
safety
instituted
in
april
and
composed
of
nine
members
directed
at
first
by
danton
and
in
the
july
of
the
same
year
by
robespierre
it
gradually
absorbed
all
the
powers
of
government
including
that
of
giving
orders
to
ministers
and
generals
carnot
directed
the
operations
of
the
war
cambon
the
finances
and
and
the
general
policy
although
the
laws
voted
by
the
technical
committees
were
often
very
wise
and
constituted
the
lasting
work
of
the
convention
those
which
the
assembly
voted
in
a
body
under
the
threats
of
the
delegations
which
invaded
it
were
manifestly
ridiculous
among
these
laws
which
were
not
greatly
in
the
interests
of
the
public
or
of
the
convention
itself
were
the
law
of
the
maximum
voted
in
september
which
pretended
to
fix
the
price
of
provisions
and
which
merely
established
a
continual
dearth
the
destruction
of
the
royal
tombs
at
the
trial
of
the
queen
the
systematic
devastation
of
the
vendee
by
fire
the
establishment
of
the
revolutionary
tribunal
the
terror
was
the
chief
means
of
government
during
the
convention
commencing
in
september
it
reigned
for
six
months
that
is
until
the
death
of
robespierre
vainly
did
certain
jacobins
danton
camille
desmoulins
herault
de
sechelles
propose
that
clemency
should
be
given
a
trial
the
only
result
of
this
proposition
was
that
its
authors
were
sent
to
the
scaffold
it
was
merely
the
lassitude
of
the
public
that
finally
put
an
end
to
this
shameful
period
the
successive
struggles
of
the
various
parties
in
the
convention
and
its
tendency
towards
extremes
eliminated
one
by
one
the
men
of
importance
who
had
once
played
their
part
therein
finally
it
fell
under
the
exclusive
domination
of
robespierre
while
the
convention
was
disorganising
and
ravaging
france
the
armies
were
winning
brilliant
victories
they
had
seized
the
left
bank
of
the
rhine
belgium
and
holland
the
treaty
of
basle
ratified
these
conquests
we
have
already
mentioned
and
we
shall
return
to
the
matter
again
that
the
work
of
the
armies
must
be
considered
absolutely
apart
from
that
of
the
convention
contemporaries
understood
this
perfectly
but
it
is
often
forgotten
when
the
convention
was
dissolved
in
after
lasting
for
three
years
it
was
regarded
with
universal
distrust
the
perpetual
plaything
of
popular
caprice
it
had
not
succeeded
in
pacifying
france
but
had
plunged
her
into
anarchy
the
general
opinion
respecting
the
convention
is
well
summed
up
in
a
letter
written
in
july
by
the
swedish
charge
baron
drinkmann
i
venture
to
hope
that
no
people
will
ever
be
governed
by
the
will
of
more
cruel
and
imbecile
scoundrels
than
those
that
have
ruled
france
since
the
beginning
of
her
new
liberty
the
end
of
the
convention
the
beginnings
of
the
directory
at
the
end
of
its
existence
the
convention
always
trusting
to
the
power
of
formulae
drafted
a
new
constitution
that
of
the
year
intended
to
replace
that
of
which
had
never
been
put
into
execution
the
legislative
power
was
to
be
shared
by
a
council
of
ancients
composed
of
members
and
a
council
of
deputies
numbering
the
executive
power
was
confided
to
a
directory
of
five
members
who
were
appointed
by
the
ancients
upon
nomination
by
the
five
hundred
and
renewed
every
year
by
the
election
of
one
of
their
number
it
was
specified
that
of
the
members
of
the
new
assembly
should
be
chosen
from
among
the
deputies
of
the
convention
this
prudent
measure
was
not
very
efficacious
as
only
ten
departments
remained
faithful
to
the
jacobins
to
avoid
the
election
of
royalists
the
convention
had
decided
to
banish
all
emigres
in
perpetuity
the
announcement
of
this
constitution
did
not
produce
the
anticipated
effect
upon
the
public
it
had
no
effect
upon
the
popular
riots
which
continued
one
of
the
most
important
was
that
which
threatened
the
convention
on
the
of
october
the
leaders
hurled
a
veritable
army
upon
the
assembly
before
such
provocation
the
convention
finally
decided
to
defend
itself
and
sent
for
troops
entrusting
the
command
to
barras
bonaparte
who
was
then
beginning
to
emerge
from
obscurity
was
entrusted
with
the
task
of
repression
with
such
a
leader
action
was
swift
and
energetic
vigorously
pounded
with
ball
near
the
church
at
roch
the
insurgents
fled
leaving
some
hundreds
of
dead
on
the
spot
this
action
which
displayed
a
firmness
to
which
the
convention
was
little
habituated
was
only
due
to
the
celerity
of
the
military
operations
for
while
these
were
being
carried
out
the
insurgents
had
sent
delegates
to
the
assembly
which
as
usual
showed
itself
quite
ready
to
yield
to
them
the
repression
of
this
riot
constituted
the
last
important
act
of
the
convention
on
the
of
october
it
declared
its
mission
terminated
and
gave
way
to
the
directory
we
have
already
laid
stress
upon
some
of
the
psychological
lessons
furnished
by
the
government
of
the
convention
one
of
the
most
striking
of
these
is
the
impotence
of
violence
to
dominate
men
minds
in
permanence
never
did
any
government
possess
such
formidable
means
of
action
yet
in
spite
of
the
permanent
guillotine
despite
the
delegates
sent
with
the
guillotine
into
the
provinces
despite
its
draconian
laws
the
convention
had
to
struggle
perpetually
against
riots
insurrections
and
conspiracies
the
cities
the
departments
and
the
faubourgs
of
paris
were
continually
rising
in
revolt
although
heads
were
falling
by
the
thousand
this
assembly
which
thought
itself
sovereign
fought
against
the
invincible
forces
which
were
fixed
in
men
minds
and
which
material
constraint
was
powerless
to
overcome
of
these
hidden
motive
forces
it
never
understood
the
power
and
it
struggled
against
them
in
vain
in
the
end
the
invisible
forces
triumphed
chapter
v
instances
of
revolutionary
violence
psychological
causes
of
revolutionary
violence
we
have
shown
in
the
course
of
the
preceding
chapters
that
the
revolutionary
theories
constituted
a
new
faith
humanitarian
and
sentimental
they
exalted
liberty
and
fraternity
but
as
in
many
religions
we
can
observe
a
complete
contradiction
between
doctrine
and
action
in
practice
no
liberty
was
tolerated
and
fraternity
was
quickly
replaced
by
frenzied
massacres
this
opposition
between
principles
and
conduct
results
from
the
intolerance
which
accompanies
all
beliefs
a
religion
may
be
steeped
in
humanitarianism
and
forbearance
but
its
sectaries
will
always
want
to
impose
it
on
others
by
force
so
that
violence
is
the
inevitable
result
the
cruelties
of
the
revolution
were
thus
the
inherent
results
of
the
propagation
of
the
new
dogmas
the
inquisition
the
religious
wars
of
france
bartholomew
day
the
revocation
of
the
edict
of
nantes
the
dragonnades
the
persecution
of
the
jansenists
belonged
to
the
same
family
as
the
terror
and
derived
from
the
same
psychological
sources
louis
xiv
was
not
a
cruel
king
yet
under
the
impulse
of
his
faith
he
drove
hundreds
of
thousands
of
protestants
out
of
france
after
first
shooting
down
a
considerable
number
and
sending
others
to
the
galleys
the
methods
of
persuasion
adopted
by
all
believers
are
by
no
means
a
consequence
of
their
fear
of
the
dissentient
opposition
protestants
and
jansenists
were
anything
but
dangerous
under
louis
xiv
intolerance
arises
above
all
from
the
indignation
experienced
by
a
mind
which
is
convinced
that
it
possesses
the
most
dazzling
verities
against
the
men
who
deny
those
truths
and
who
are
surely
not
acting
in
good
faith
how
can
one
support
error
when
one
has
the
necessary
strength
to
wipe
it
out
thus
have
reasoned
the
believers
of
all
ages
thus
reasoned
louis
xiv
and
the
men
of
the
terror
these
latter
also
were
convinced
that
they
were
in
possession
of
absolute
truths
which
they
believed
to
be
obvious
and
whose
triumph
was
certain
to
regenerate
humanity
could
they
be
more
tolerant
toward
their
adversaries
than
the
church
and
the
kings
of
france
had
been
toward
heretics
we
are
forced
to
believe
that
terror
is
a
method
which
all
believers
regard
as
a
necessity
since
from
the
beginning
of
the
ages
religious
codes
have
always
been
based
upon
terror
to
force
men
to
observe
their
prescriptions
believers
have
sought
to
terrify
them
with
threats
of
an
eternal
hell
of
torments
the
apostles
of
the
jacobin
belief
behaved
as
their
fathers
had
done
and
employed
the
same
methods
if
similar
events
occurred
again
we
should
see
identical
actions
repeated
if
a
new
belief
socialism
for
example
were
to
triumph
it
would
be
led
to
employ
methods
of
propaganda
like
those
of
the
inquisition
and
the
terror
but
were
we
to
regard
the
jacobin
terror
solely
as
the
result
of
a
religious
movement
we
should
not
completely
apprehend
it
around
a
triumphant
religious
belief
as
we
saw
in
the
case
of
the
reformation
gather
a
host
of
individual
interests
which
are
dependent
on
that
belief
the
terror
was
directed
by
a
few
fanatical
apostles
but
beside
this
small
number
of
ardent
proselytes
whose
narrow
minds
dreamed
of
regenerating
the
world
were
great
numbers
of
men
who
lived
only
to
enrich
themselves
they
rallied
readily
around
the
first
victorious
leader
who
promised
to
enable
them
to
enjoy
the
results
of
their
pillage
the
terrorists
of
the
revolution
writes
albert
sorel
resorted
to
the
terror
because
they
wished
to
remain
in
power
and
were
incapable
of
doing
so
by
other
means
they
employed
it
for
their
own
salvation
and
after
the
event
they
stated
that
their
motive
was
the
salvation
of
the
state
before
it
became
a
system
it
was
a
means
of
government
and
the
system
was
only
invented
to
justify
the
means
we
may
thus
fully
agree
with
the
following
verdict
on
the
terror
written
by
emile
ollivier
in
his
work
on
the
revolution
the
terror
was
above
all
a
jacquerie
a
regularised
pillage
the
vastest
enterprise
of
theft
that
any
association
of
criminals
has
ever
organised
the
revolutionary
tribunals
the
revolutionary
tribunals
constituted
the
principal
means
of
action
of
the
terror
besides
that
of
paris
created
at
the
instigation
of
danton
and
which
a
year
afterwards
sent
its
founder
to
the
guillotine
france
was
covered
with
such
tribunals
one
hundred
and
tribunals
says
taine
of
which
were
perambulant
pronounced
death
sentences
in
all
parts
of
the
country
which
were
carried
out
instantly
on
the
spot
between
the
of
april
and
the
of
thermidor
in
the
year
ii
that
of
paris
guillotined
persons
and
the
provincial
judges
worked
as
hard
as
those
of
paris
in
the
little
town
of
orange
alone
persons
were
guillotined
in
the
city
of
arras
men
and
women
were
guillotined
in
the
city
of
lyons
alone
the
revolutionary
commissioner
admitted
to
executions
the
total
number
of
these
murders
has
been
put
at
among
whom
were
women
of
whom
a
number
were
octogenarians
although
the
revolutionary
tribunal
of
paris
claimed
only
victims
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
all
the
suspects
had
already
been
summarily
massacred
during
the
days
of
september
the
revolutionary
tribunal
of
paris
a
mere
instrument
of
the
committee
of
public
safety
limited
itself
in
reality
as
justly
remarked
during
his
trial
to
executing
its
orders
it
surrounded
itself
at
first
with
a
few
legal
forms
which
did
not
long
survive
interrogatory
defence
witnesses
all
were
finally
suppressed
moral
proof
that
is
mere
suspicion
sufficed
to
procure
condemnation
the
president
usually
contented
himself
with
putting
a
vague
question
to
the
accused
to
work
more
rapidly
still
proposed
to
have
the
guillotine
installed
on
the
same
premises
as
the
tribunal
this
tribunal
sent
indiscriminately
to
the
scaffold
all
the
accused
persons
arrested
by
reason
of
party
hatred
and
very
soon
in
the
hands
of
robespierre
it
constituted
an
instrument
of
the
bloodiest
tyranny
when
danton
one
of
its
founders
became
its
victim
he
justly
asked
pardon
of
god
and
men
before
mounting
the
scaffold
for
having
assisted
to
create
such
a
tribunal
nothing
found
mercy
before
it
neither
the
genius
of
lavoisier
nor
the
gentleness
of
lucile
desmoulins
nor
the
merit
of
malesherbes
so
much
talent
said
benjamin
constant
massacred
by
the
most
cowardly
and
brutish
of
men
to
find
any
excuse
for
the
revolutionary
tribunal
we
must
return
to
our
conception
of
the
religious
mentality
of
the
jacobins
who
founded
and
directed
it
it
was
a
piece
of
work
comparable
in
its
spirit
and
its
aim
to
the
inquisition
the
men
who
furnished
its
victims
robespierre
and
couthon
believed
themselves
the
benefactors
of
the
human
race
in
suppressing
all
infidels
the
enemies
of
the
faith
that
was
to
regenerate
the
earth
the
executions
during
the
terror
did
not
affect
the
members
of
the
aristocracy
only
since
peasants
and
were
guillotined
given
the
emotion
produced
in
paris
in
our
days
by
a
capital
execution
one
might
suppose
that
the
execution
of
so
many
persons
at
one
time
would
produce
a
very
great
emotion
but
habit
had
so
dulled
sensibility
that
people
paid
but
little
attention
to
the
matter
at
last
mothers
would
take
their
children
to
see
people
guillotined
as
they
take
them
to
the
marionette
theatre
the
daily
spectacle
of
executions
made
the
men
of
the
time
very
indifferent
to
death
all
mounted
the
scaffold
with
perfect
tranquillity
the
girondists
singing
the
marseillaise
as
they
climbed
the
steps
this
resignation
resulted
from
the
law
of
habitude
which
very
rapidly
dulls
emotion
to
judge
by
the
fact
that
royalist
risings
were
taking
place
daily
the
prospect
of
the
guillotine
no
longer
terrified
men
things
happened
as
though
the
terror
terrorised
no
one
terror
is
an
efficacious
psychological
process
so
long
as
it
does
not
last
the
real
terror
resides
far
more
in
threats
than
in
their
realisation
the
terror
in
the
provinces
the
executions
of
the
revolutionary
tribunals
in
the
provinces
represented
only
a
portion
of
the
massacres
effected
in
the
departments
during
the
terror
the
revolutionary
army
composed
of
vagabonds
and
brigands
marched
through
france
killing
and
pillaging
its
method
of
procedure
is
well
indicated
by
the
following
passage
from
taine
at
bedouin
a
town
of
inhabitants
where
unknown
hands
had
cut
down
the
tree
of
liberty
houses
were
demolished
or
fired
persons
were
guillotined
and
shot
down
all
the
other
inhabitants
were
expelled
and
reduced
to
living
as
vagabonds
in
the
mountains
and
to
taking
shelter
in
caverns
which
they
hollowed
out
of
the
earth
the
fate
of
the
wretches
sent
before
the
revolutionary
tribunals
was
no
better
the
first
mockery
of
trial
was
quickly
suppressed
at
nantes
carrier
drowned
and
shot
down
according
to
his
fancy
nearly
persons
men
women
and
children
the
details
of
these
massacres
figured
in
the
moniteur
after
the
reaction
of
thermidor
i
cite
a
few
lines
i
saw
says
thomas
after
the
taking
of
noirmoutier
men
and
women
and
old
people
burned
alive
women
violated
girls
of
fourteen
and
fifteen
and
massacred
afterward
and
tender
babes
thrown
from
bayonet
to
bayonet
children
who
were
taken
from
beside
their
mothers
stretched
out
on
the
ground
in
the
same
number
we
read
a
deposition
by
one
julien
relating
how
carrier
forced
his
victims
to
dig
their
graves
and
to
allow
themselves
to
be
buried
alive
the
issue
of
october
contained
a
report
by
merlin
de
thionville
proving
that
the
captain
of
the
vessel
le
destin
had
received
orders
to
embark
victims
to
be
drowned
among
them
a
blind
man
of
twelve
women
twelve
girls
and
fourteen
children
of
whom
ten
were
from
to
and
five
at
the
breast
in
the
course
of
carrier
trial
moniteur
december
it
was
proved
that
he
had
given
orders
to
drown
and
shoot
women
and
children
and
had
ordered
general
haxo
to
exterminate
all
the
inhabitants
of
la
vendee
and
to
burn
down
their
dwellings
carrier
like
all
wholesale
murderers
took
an
intense
joy
in
seeing
his
victims
suffer
in
the
department
in
which
i
hunted
the
priests
he
said
i
have
never
laughed
so
much
or
experienced
such
pleasure
as
in
watching
their
dying
grimaces
moniteur
december
carrier
was
tried
to
satisfy
the
reaction
of
thermidor
but
the
massacres
of
nantes
were
repeated
in
many
other
towns
fouche
slew
more
than
persons
at
lyons
and
so
many
were
killed
at
toulon
that
the
population
fell
from
to
in
a
few
months
we
must
say
in
defence
of
carrier
freron
fouche
and
all
these
sinister
persons
that
they
were
incessantly
stimulated
by
the
committee
of
public
safety
carrier
gave
proof
of
this
during
his
trial
i
admit
said
he
moniteur
december
that
or
prisoners
were
shot
every
day
but
it
was
by
order
of
the
commission
i
informed
the
convention
that
the
brigands
were
being
shot
down
by
hundreds
and
it
applauded
this
letter
and
ordered
its
insertion
in
the
bulletin
what
were
these
deputies
doing
then
who
are
so
furious
against
me
now
they
were
applauding
why
did
they
still
keep
me
mission
because
i
was
then
the
saviour
of
the
country
and
now
i
am
a
bloodthirsty
man
unhappily
for
him
carrier
did
not
know
as
he
remarked
in
the
same
speech
that
only
seven
or
eight
persons
led
the
convention
but
the
terrorised
assembly
approved
of
all
that
these
seven
or
eight
ordered
so
that
they
could
say
nothing
in
reply
to
carrier
argument
he
certainly
deserved
to
be
guillotined
but
the
whole
convention
deserved
to
be
guillotined
with
him
since
it
had
approved
of
the
massacres
the
defence
of
carrier
justified
by
the
letters
of
the
committee
by
which
the
representatives
on
mission
were
incessantly
stimulated
shows
that
the
violence
of
the
terror
resulted
from
a
system
and
not
as
has
sometimes
been
claimed
from
the
initiative
of
a
few
individuals
the
thirst
for
destruction
during
the
terror
was
by
no
means
assuaged
by
the
destruction
of
human
beings
only
there
was
an
even
greater
destruction
of
inanimate
things
the
true
believer
is
always
an
iconoclast
once
in
power
he
destroys
with
equal
zeal
the
enemies
of
his
faith
and
the
images
temples
and
symbols
which
recall
the
faith
attacked
we
know
that
the
first
action
of
the
emperor
theodosius
when
converted
to
the
christian
religion
was
to
break
down
the
majority
of
the
temples
which
for
six
thousand
years
had
been
built
beside
the
nile
we
must
not
therefore
be
surprised
to
see
the
leaders
of
the
revolution
attacking
the
monuments
and
works
of
art
which
for
them
were
the
vestiges
of
an
abhorred
past
statues
manuscripts
stained
glass
windows
and
plate
were
frenziedly
broken
when
fouche
the
future
duke
of
otranto
under
napoleon
and
minister
under
louis
was
sent
as
commissary
of
the
convention
to
the
nievre
he
ordered
the
demolition
of
all
the
towers
of
the
chateaux
and
the
belfries
of
the
churches
because
they
wounded
equality
revolutionary
vandalism
expended
itself
even
on
the
tomb
following
a
report
read
by
barrere
to
the
convention
the
magnificent
royal
tombs
at
among
which
was
the
admirable
mausoleum
of
henri
by
germain
pilon
were
smashed
to
pieces
the
coffins
emptied
and
the
body
of
turenne
sent
to
the
museum
as
a
curiosity
after
one
of
the
keepers
had
extracted
the
teeth
in
order
to
sell
them
as
curiosities
the
moustache
and
beard
of
henri
iv
were
also
torn
out
it
is
impossible
to
witness
such
comparatively
enlightened
men
consenting
to
the
destruction
of
the
artistic
patriotism
of
france
without
a
feeling
of
sadness
to
excuse
them
we
must
remember
that
intense
beliefs
give
rise
to
the
worst
excesses
and
also
that
the
convention
almost
daily
invaded
by
rioters
always
yielded
to
the
popular
will
this
glowing
record
of
devastation
proves
not
only
the
power
of
fanaticism
it
shows
us
what
becomes
of
men
who
are
liberated
from
all
social
restraints
and
of
the
country
which
falls
into
their
hands
chapter
vi
the
armies
of
the
revolution
the
revolutionary
assemblies
and
the
armies
if
nothing
were
known
of
the
revolutionary
assemblies
and
notably
of
the
convention
beyond
their
internal
dissensions
their
weakness
and
their
acts
of
violence
their
memory
would
indeed
be
a
gloomy
one
but
even
for
its
enemies
this
bloodstained
epoch
must
always
retain
an
undeniable
glory
thanks
to
the
success
of
its
armies
when
the
convention
dissolved
france
was
already
the
greater
by
belgium
and
the
territories
on
the
left
bank
of
the
rhine
regarding
the
convention
as
a
whole
it
seems
equitable
to
credit
it
with
the
victories
of
the
armies
of
france
but
if
we
analyse
this
whole
in
order
to
study
each
of
its
elements
separately
their
independence
will
at
once
be
obvious
it
is
at
once
apparent
that
the
convention
had
a
very
small
share
in
the
military
events
of
the
time
the
armies
on
the
frontier
and
the
revolutionary
assemblies
in
paris
formed
two
separate
worlds
which
had
very
little
influence
over
one
another
and
which
regarded
matters
in
a
very
different
light
we
have
seen
that
the
convention
was
a
weak
government
which
changed
its
ideas
daily
according
to
popular
impulse
it
was
really
an
example
of
the
profoundest
anarchy
it
directed
nothing
but
was
itself
continually
directed
how
then
could
it
have
commanded
armies
completely
absorbed
in
its
intestine
quarrels
the
assembly
had
abandoned
all
military
questions
to
a
special
committee
which
was
directed
almost
by
carnot
and
whose
real
function
was
to
furnish
the
troops
with
provisions
and
ammunition
the
merit
of
carnot
consisted
in
the
fact
that
besides
directing
over
men
at
the
disposal
of
france
upon
points
which
were
strategically
valuable
he
also
advised
the
generals
of
the
armies
to
take
the
offensive
and
to
preserve
a
strict
discipline
the
sole
share
of
the
assembly
in
the
defence
of
the
country
was
the
decree
of
the
general
levy
in
the
face
of
the
numerous
enemies
then
threatening
france
no
government
could
have
avoided
such
a
measure
for
some
little
time
too
the
assembly
had
sent
representatives
to
the
armies
instructed
to
decapitate
certain
generals
but
this
policy
was
soon
abandoned
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
military
activities
of
the
assembly
were
always
extremely
slight
the
armies
thanks
to
their
numbers
their
enthusiasm
and
the
tactics
devised
by
their
youthful
generals
achieved
their
victories
unaided
they
fought
and
conquered
independently
of
the
convention
the
struggle
of
europe
against
the
revolution
before
enumerating
the
various
psychological
factors
which
contributed
to
the
successes
of
the
revolutionary
armies
it
will
be
useful
briefly
to
recall
the
origin
and
the
development
of
the
war
against
europe
at
the
commencement
of
the
revolution
the
foreign
sovereigns
regarded
with
satisfaction
the
difficulties
of
the
french
monarchy
which
they
had
long
regarded
as
a
rival
power
the
king
of
prussia
believing
france
to
be
greatly
enfeebled
thought
to
enrich
himself
at
her
expense
so
he
proposed
to
the
emperor
of
austria
to
help
louis
on
condition
of
receiving
flanders
and
alsace
as
an
indemnity
the
two
sovereigns
signed
an
alliance
against
france
in
february
the
french
anticipated
attack
by
declaring
war
upon
austria
under
the
influence
of
the
girondists
the
french
army
was
at
the
outset
subjected
to
several
checks
the
allies
penetrated
into
champagne
and
came
within
miles
of
paris
victory
at
valmy
forced
them
to
retire
although
french
and
prussians
only
were
killed
in
this
battle
it
had
very
significant
results
the
fact
that
an
army
reputed
invincible
had
been
forced
to
retreat
gave
boldness
to
the
young
revolutionary
troops
and
everywhere
they
took
the
offensive
in
a
few
weeks
the
soldiers
of
valmy
had
chased
the
austrians
out
of
belgium
where
they
were
welcomed
as
liberators
but
it
was
under
the
convention
that
the
war
assumed
such
importance
at
the
beginning
of
the
assembly
declared
that
belgium
was
united
to
france
from
this
resulted
a
conflict
with
england
which
lasted
for
years
assembled
at
antwerp
in
april
the
representatives
of
england
prussia
and
austria
resolved
to
dismember
france
the
prussians
were
to
seize
alsace
and
lorraine
the
austrians
flanders
and
artois
the
english
dunkirk
the
austrian
ambassador
proposed
to
crush
the
revolution
by
terror
by
exterminating
practically
the
whole
of
the
party
directing
the
nation
in
the
face
of
such
declarations
france
had
perforce
to
conquer
or
to
perish
during
this
first
coalition
between
and
france
had
to
fight
on
all
her
frontiers
from
the
pyrenees
to
the
north
at
the
outset
she
lost
her
former
conquests
and
suffered
several
reverses
the
spaniards
took
perpignan
and
bayonne
the
english
toulon
and
the
austrians
valenciennes
it
was
then
that
the
convention
towards
the
end
of
ordered
a
general
levy
of
all
frenchmen
between
the
ages
of
eighteen
and
forty
and
succeeded
in
sending
to
the
frontiers
a
total
of
some
men
the
old
regiments
of
the
royal
army
were
combined
with
battalions
of
volunteers
and
conscripts
the
allies
were
repulsed
and
maubeuge
was
relieved
after
the
victory
of
wattigny
which
was
gained
by
jourdan
hoche
rescued
lorraine
france
took
the
offensive
reconquering
belgium
and
the
left
bank
of
the
rhine
jourdan
defeated
the
austrians
at
fleurus
drove
them
back
upon
the
rhine
and
occupied
cologne
and
coblentz
holland
was
invaded
the
allied
sovereigns
resigned
themselves
to
suing
for
peace
and
recognised
the
french
conquests
the
successes
of
the
french
were
favoured
by
the
fact
that
the
enemy
never
put
their
whole
heart
into
the
affair
as
they
were
preoccupied
by
the
partition
of
poland
which
they
effected
in
each
power
wished
to
be
on
the
spot
in
order
to
obtain
more
territory
this
motive
had
already
caused
the
king
of
prussia
to
retire
after
the
battle
of
valmy
in
the
hesitations
of
the
allies
and
their
mutual
distrust
were
extremely
advantageous
to
the
french
had
the
austrians
marched
upon
paris
in
the
summer
of
we
should
said
general
thiebault
have
lost
a
hundred
times
for
one
they
alone
saved
us
by
giving
us
time
to
make
soldiers
officers
and
generals
after
the
treaty
of
basle
france
had
no
important
adversaries
on
the
continent
save
the
austrians
it
was
then
that
the
directory
attacked
austria
in
italy
bonaparte
was
entrusted
with
the
charge
of
this
campaign
after
a
year
of
fighting
from
april
to
april
he
forced
the
last
enemies
of
france
to
demand
peace
psychological
and
military
factors
which
determined
the
success
of
the
revolutionary
armies
to
realise
the
causes
of
the
success
of
the
revolutionary
armies
we
must
remember
the
prodigious
enthusiasm
endurance
and
abnegation
of
these
ragged
and
often
barefoot
troops
thoroughly
steeped
in
revolutionary
principles
they
felt
that
they
were
the
apostles
of
a
new
religion
which
was
destined
to
regenerate
the
world
the
history
of
the
armies
of
the
revolution
recalls
that
of
the
nomads
of
arabia
who
excited
to
fanaticism
by
the
ideals
of
mohammed
were
transformed
into
formidable
armies
which
rapidly
conquered
a
portion
of
the
old
roman
world
an
analogous
faith
endowed
the
republican
soldiers
with
a
heroism
and
intrepidity
which
never
failed
them
and
which
no
reverse
could
shake
when
the
convention
gave
place
to
the
directory
they
had
liberated
the
country
and
had
carried
a
war
of
invasion
into
the
enemy
territory
at
this
period
the
soldiers
were
the
only
true
republicans
left
in
france
faith
is
contagious
and
the
revolution
was
regarded
as
a
new
era
so
that
several
of
the
nations
invaded
oppressed
by
the
absolutism
of
their
monarchs
welcomed
the
invaders
as
liberators
the
inhabitants
of
savoy
ran
out
to
meet
the
troops
at
mayence
the
crowd
welcomed
them
with
enthusiasm
planted
trees
of
liberty
and
formed
a
convention
in
imitation
of
that
of
paris
so
long
as
the
armies
of
the
revolution
had
to
deal
with
peoples
bent
under
the
yoke
of
absolute
monarchy
and
having
no
personal
ideal
to
defend
their
success
was
relatively
easy
but
when
they
entered
into
conflict
with
peoples
who
had
an
ideal
as
strong
as
their
own
victory
became
far
more
difficult
the
new
ideal
of
liberty
and
equality
was
capable
of
seducing
peoples
who
had
no
precise
convictions
and
were
suffering
from
the
despotism
of
their
masters
but
it
was
naturally
powerless
against
those
who
possessed
a
potent
ideal
of
their
own
which
had
been
long
established
in
their
minds
for
this
reason
bretons
and
vendeeans
whose
religious
and
monarchical
sentiments
were
extremely
powerful
successfully
struggled
for
years
against
the
armies
of
the
republic
in
march
the
insurrections
of
the
vendee
and
brittany
had
spread
to
ten
departments
the
vendeeans
in
poitou
and
the
chouans
in
brittany
put
men
in
the
field
the
conflicts
between
contrary
ideals
that
is
between
beliefs
in
which
reason
can
play
no
part
are
always
pitiless
and
the
struggle
with
the
vendee
immediately
assumed
the
ferocious
savagery
always
observable
in
religious
wars
it
lasted
until
the
end
of
when
hoche
finally
pacified
the
country
this
pacification
was
the
simple
result
of
the
practical
extermination
of
its
defenders
after
two
years
of
civil
war
writes
molinari
the
vendee
was
no
more
than
a
hideous
heap
of
ruins
about
individuals
men
women
children
and
aged
people
had
perished
and
the
small
number
of
those
who
had
escaped
massacre
could
scarcely
find
food
or
shelter
the
fields
were
devastated
the
hedges
and
walls
destroyed
and
the
houses
burned
besides
their
faith
which
so
often
rendered
them
invincible
the
soldiers
of
the
revolution
had
usually
the
advantage
of
being
led
by
remarkable
generals
full
of
ardour
and
formed
on
the
field
the
majority
of
the
former
leaders
of
the
army
being
nobles
had
emigrated
so
that
a
new
body
of
officers
had
to
be
organised
the
result
was
that
those
gifted
with
innate
military
aptitudes
had
a
chance
of
showing
them
and
passed
through
all
the
grades
of
rank
in
a
few
months
hoche
for
instance
a
corporal
in
was
a
general
of
division
and
commander
of
an
army
at
the
age
of
the
extreme
youth
of
these
leaders
resulted
in
a
spirit
of
aggression
to
which
the
armies
opposed
to
them
were
not
accustomed
selected
only
according
to
merit
and
hampered
by
no
traditions
no
routine
they
quickly
succeeded
in
working
out
a
tactics
suited
to
the
new
necessities
of
soldiers
without
experience
opposed
to
seasoned
professional
troops
drilled
and
trained
according
to
the
methods
in
use
everywhere
since
the
seven
years
war
one
could
not
expect
complicated
manoeuvres
attacks
were
delivered
simply
by
great
masses
of
troops
thanks
to
the
numbers
of
the
men
at
the
disposal
of
their
generals
the
considerable
gaps
provoked
by
this
efficacious
but
barbarous
procedure
could
be
rapidly
filled
deep
masses
of
men
attacked
the
enemy
with
the
bayonet
and
quickly
routed
men
accustomed
to
methods
which
were
more
careful
of
the
lives
of
soldiers
the
slow
rate
of
fire
in
those
days
rendered
the
french
tactics
relatively
easy
of
employment
it
triumphed
but
at
the
cost
of
enormous
losses
it
has
been
calculated
that
between
and
the
french
army
left
more
than
a
third
of
its
effective
force
on
the
men
out
of
examining
events
from
a
psychological
point
of
view
we
shall
continue
to
elicit
the
consequences
from
the
facts
on
which
they
are
consequent
a
study
of
the
revolutionary
crowds
in
paris
and
in
the
armies
presents
very
different
but
readily
interpreted
pictures
we
have
proved
that
crowds
unable
to
reason
obey
simply
their
impulses
which
are
always
changing
but
we
have
also
seen
that
they
are
readily
capable
of
heroism
that
their
altruism
is
often
highly
developed
and
that
it
is
easy
to
find
thousands
of
men
ready
to
give
their
lives
for
a
belief
psychological
characteristics
so
diverse
must
naturally
according
to
the
circumstances
lead
to
dissimilar
and
even
absolutely
contradictory
actions
the
history
of
the
convention
and
its
armies
proves
as
much
it
shows
us
crowds
composed
of
similar
elements
acting
so
differently
in
paris
and
on
the
frontiers
that
one
can
hardly
believe
the
same
people
can
be
in
question
in
paris
the
crowds
were
disorderly
violent
murderous
and
so
changeable
in
their
demands
as
to
make
all
government
impossible
in
the
armies
the
picture
was
entirely
different
the
same
multitudes
of
unaccustomed
men
restrained
by
the
orderly
elements
of
a
laborious
peasant
population
standardised
by
military
discipline
and
inspired
by
contagious
enthusiasm
heroically
supported
privations
disdained
perils
and
contributed
to
form
that
fabulous
strain
which
triumphed
over
the
most
redoubtable
troops
in
europe
these
facts
are
among
those
which
should
always
be
invoked
to
show
the
force
of
discipline
it
transforms
men
liberated
from
its
influence
peoples
and
armies
become
barbarian
hordes
this
truth
is
daily
and
increasingly
forgotten
ignoring
the
fundamental
laws
of
collective
logic
we
give
way
more
and
more
to
shifting
popular
impulses
instead
of
learning
to
direct
them
the
multitude
must
be
shown
the
road
to
follow
it
is
not
for
them
to
choose
it

psychology
of
the
leaders
of
the
revolution
mentality
of
the
men
of
the
revolution
the
respective
influence
of
violent
and
feeble
characters
men
judge
with
their
intelligence
and
are
guided
by
their
characters
to
understand
a
man
fully
one
must
separate
these
two
elements
during
the
great
periods
of
activity
and
the
revolutionary
movements
naturally
belong
to
such
periods
character
always
takes
the
first
rank
having
in
several
chapters
described
the
various
mentalities
which
predominate
in
times
of
disturbance
we
need
not
return
to
the
subject
now
they
constitute
general
types
which
are
naturally
modified
by
each
man
inherited
and
acquired
personality
we
have
seen
what
an
important
part
was
played
by
the
mystic
element
in
the
jacobin
mentality
and
the
ferocious
fanaticism
to
which
it
led
the
sectaries
of
the
new
faith
we
have
also
seen
that
all
the
members
of
the
assemblies
were
not
fanatics
these
latter
were
even
in
the
minority
since
in
the
most
sanguinary
of
the
revolutionary
assemblies
the
great
majority
was
composed
of
timid
and
moderate
men
of
neutral
character
before
thermidor
the
members
of
this
group
voted
from
fear
with
the
violent
and
after
thermidor
with
the
moderate
deputies
in
time
of
revolution
as
at
other
times
these
neutral
characters
obeying
the
most
contrary
impulses
are
always
the
most
numerous
they
are
also
as
dangerous
in
reality
as
the
violent
characters
the
force
of
the
latter
is
supported
by
the
weakness
of
the
former
in
all
revolutions
and
in
particularly
in
the
french
revolution
we
observe
a
small
minority
of
narrow
but
decided
minds
which
imperiously
dominate
an
immense
majority
of
men
who
are
often
very
intelligent
but
are
lacking
in
character
besides
the
fanatical
apostles
and
the
feeble
characters
a
revolution
always
produces
individuals
who
merely
think
how
to
profit
thereby
these
were
numerous
during
the
french
revolution
their
aim
was
simply
to
utilise
circumstances
so
as
to
enrich
themselves
such
were
barras
tallien
fouche
barrere
and
many
more
their
politics
consisted
simply
in
serving
the
strong
against
the
weak
from
the
outset
of
the
revolution
these
arrivists
as
one
would
call
them
were
numerous
camille
desmoulins
wrote
in
our
revolution
has
its
roots
only
in
the
egotism
and
of
each
individual
of
the
combination
of
which
the
general
interest
is
composed
if
we
add
to
these
indications
the
observations
contained
in
another
chapter
concerning
the
various
forms
of
mentality
to
be
observed
in
times
of
political
upheaval
we
shall
obtain
a
general
idea
of
the
character
of
the
men
of
the
revolution
we
shall
now
apply
the
principles
already
expounded
to
the
most
remarkable
personages
of
the
revolutionary
period
psychology
of
the
commissaries
or
representatives
on
mission
in
paris
the
conduct
of
the
members
of
the
convention
was
always
directed
restrained
or
excited
by
the
action
of
their
colleagues
and
that
of
their
environment
to
judge
them
properly
we
should
observe
them
when
left
to
themselves
and
uncontrolled
when
they
possessed
full
liberty
such
were
the
representatives
who
were
sent
on
mission
into
the
departments
by
the
convention
the
power
of
these
delegates
was
absolute
no
censure
embarrassed
them
functionaries
and
magistrates
had
perforce
to
obey
them
a
representative
on
mission
requisitions
sequestrates
or
confiscates
as
seems
good
to
him
taxes
imprisons
deports
or
decapitates
as
he
thinks
fit
and
in
his
own
district
he
is
a
regarding
themselves
as
pashas
they
displayed
themselves
drawn
in
carriages
with
six
horses
surrounded
by
guards
sitting
at
sumptuous
tables
with
thirty
covers
eating
to
the
sound
of
music
with
a
following
of
players
courtezans
and
mercenaries
at
lyons
the
solemn
appearance
of
collot
is
like
that
of
the
grand
turk
no
one
can
come
into
his
presence
without
three
repeated
requests
a
string
of
apartments
precedes
his
and
no
one
approaches
nearer
than
fifteen
paces
one
can
picture
the
immense
vanity
of
these
dictators
as
they
solemnly
entered
the
towns
surrounded
by
guards
men
whose
gesture
was
enough
to
cause
heads
to
fall
petty
lawyers
without
clients
doctors
without
patients
unfrocked
clergymen
obscure
attorneys
who
had
formerly
known
the
most
colourless
of
lives
were
suddenly
made
the
equals
of
the
most
powerful
tyrants
of
history
guillotining
drowning
shooting
without
mercy
at
the
hazard
of
their
fancy
they
were
raised
from
their
former
humble
condition
to
the
level
of
the
most
celebrated
potentates
never
did
nero
or
heliogabalus
surpass
in
tyranny
the
representatives
of
the
convention

and
customs
always
restrained
the
former
to
a
certain
extent
nothing
restrained
the

fusillades
and
at
the
sound
of
each
discharge
sprang
up
with
cries
of
joy
waving
their
hats
among
the
representatives
on
mission
who
exhibit
this
murderous
mentality
we
may
cite
as
a
type
the
lebon
who
having
become
possessed
of
supreme
power
ravaged
arras
and
cambrai
his
example
with
that
of
carrier
contributes
to
show
what
man
can
become
when
he
escapes
from
the
yoke
of
law
and
tradition
the
cruelty
of
the
ferocious
commissary
was
complicated
by
sadism
the
scaffold
was
raised
under
his
windows
so
that
he
his
wife
and
his
helpers
could
rejoice
in
the
carnage
at
the
foot
of
the
guillotine
a
was

the
executioner
would
group
on

attitudes
the
naked
bodies
of
the
decapitated
the
reading
of
the
two
volumes
of
his
trial
printed
at

in
may
be
counted
as
a
nightmare
during
twenty
sessions
the
survivors
of
the
hecatombs
of
arras
and

passed
through
the
ancient
hall
of
the

death
buffeted

to

battalions
of
children
recruited
to
guard
the
scaffold
the
debauchery
the
cynicism
the
refinements
of
an
insane
satrap
a
romance
by
sade
turned
epic
it
seems
as
we
watch
the
unpacking
of
these
horrors
that
a
whole
country
long
terrorised
is
at
last
disgorging
its
terror
and
revenging
itself
for
its
cowardice
by
overwhelming
the
wretch
there
the
scapegoat
of
an
abhorred
and
vanished
system
the
only
defence
of
the
was
that
he
had
obeyed
orders
the
facts
with
which
he
was
reproached
had
long
been
known
and
the
convention
had
in
no
wise
blamed
him
for
them
i
have
already
spoken
of
the
vanity
of
the
deputies
on
mission
who
were
suddenly
endowed
with
a
power
greater
than
that
of
the
most
powerful
despots
but
this
vanity
is
not
enough
to
explain
their
ferocity
that
arose
from
other
sources
apostles
of
a
severe
faith
the
delegates
of
the
convention
like
the
inquisitors
of
the
holy
office
could
feel
can
have
felt
no
pity
for
their
victims
freed
moreover
from
all
the
bonds
of
tradition
and
law
they
could
give
rein
to
the
most
savage
instincts
that
primitive
animality
has
left
in
us
civilisation
restrains
these
instincts
but
they
never
die
the
need
to
kill
which
makes
the
hunter
is
a
permanent
proof
of
this
has
expressed
in
the
following
lines
the
grip
of
this
hereditary
tendency
which
in
the
pursuit
of
the
most
harmless
game
the
barbarian
in
every
hunter
the
pleasure
of
killing
for
killing
sake
is
one
may
say
universal
it
is
the
basis
of
the
hunting
instinct
for
it
must
be
admitted
that
at
present
in
civilised
countries
the
need
to
live
no
longer
counts
for
anything
in
its
propagation
in
reality
we
are
continuing
an
action
which
was
imperiously
imposed
upon
our
savage
ancestors
by
the
harsh
necessities
of
existence
during
which
they
had
either
to
kill
or
die
of
hunger
while
day
there
is
no
longer
any
legitimate
excuse
for
it
but
so
it
is
and
we
can
do
nothing
probably
we
shall
never
break
the
chains
of
a
slavery
which
has
bound
us
for
so
long
we
can
not
prevent
ourselves
from
feeling
an
intense
often
passionate
pleasure
in
shedding
the
blood
of
animals
towards
whom
when
the
love
of
the
chase
possesses
us
we
lose
all
feeling
of
pity
the
gentlest
and
prettiest
creatures
the
the
charm
of
our
springtime
fall
to
our
guns
or
are
choked
in
our
snares
and
not
a
shudder
of
pity
troubles
our
pleasure
at
seeing
them
terrified
bleeding
writhing
in
the
horrible
suffering
we
inflict
on
them
seeking
to
flee
on
their
poor
broken
paws
or
desperately
beating
their
wings
which
can
no
longer
support
them
the
excuse
is
the
impulse
of
that
imperious
atavism
which
the
best
of
us
have
not
the
strength
to
resist
at
ordinary
times
this
singular
atavism
restrained
by
fear
of
the
laws
can
only
be
exercised
on
animals
when
codes
are
no
longer
operative
it
immediately
applies
itself
to
man
which
is
why
so
many
terrorists
took
an
intense
pleasure
in
killing
carrier
remark
concerning
the
joy
he
felt
in
contemplating
the
faces
of
his
victims
during
their
torment
is
very
typical
in
many
civilised
men
ferocity
is
a
restrained
instinct
but
it
is
by
no
means
eliminated
danton
and
robespierre
danton
and
robespierre
represented
the
two
principal
personages
of
the
revolution
i
shall
say
little
of
the
former
his
psychology
besides
being
simple
is
familiar
a
club
orator
firstly
impulsive
and
violent
he
showed
himself
always
ready
to
excite
the
people
cruel
only
in
his
speeches
he
often
regretted
their
effects
from
the
outset
he
shone
in
the
first
rank
while
his
future
rival
robespierre
was
vegetating
almost
in
the
lowest
at
one
given
moment
danton
became
the
soul
of
the
revolution
but
he
was
deficient
in
tenacity
and
fixity
of
conduct
moreover
he
was
needy
while
robespierre
was
not
the
continuous
fanaticism
of
the
latter
defeated
the
intermittent
efforts
of
the
former
nevertheless
it
was
an
amazing
spectacle
to
see
so
powerful
a
tribune
sent
to
the
scaffold
by
his
pale
venemous
enemy
and
mediocre
rival
robespierre
the
most
influential
man
of
the
revolution
and
the
most
frequently
studied
is
yet
the
least
explicable
it
is
difficult
to
understand
the
prodigious
influence
which
gave
him
the
power
of
life
and
death
not
only
over
the
enemies
of
the
revolution
but
also
over
colleagues
who
could
not
have
been
considered
as
enemies
of
the
existing
government
we
certainly
can
not
explain
the
matter
by
saying
with
taine
that
robespierre
was
a
pedant
lost
in
abstractions
nor
by
asserting
with
the
michelet
that
he
succeeded
on
account
of
his
principles
nor
by
repeating
with
his
contemporary
williams
that
one
of
the
secrets
of
his
government
was
to
take
men
marked
by
opprobrium
or
soiled
with
crime
as
to
his
ambition
it
is
impossible
to
regard
his
eloquence
as
the
cause
of
his
success
his
eyes
protected
by
goggles
he
painfully
read
his
speeches
which
were
composed
of
cold
and
indefinite
abstractions
the
assembly
contained
orators
who
possessed
an
immensely
superior
talent
such
as
danton
and
the
girondists
yet
it
was
robespierre
who
destroyed
them
we
have
really
no
acceptable
explanation
of
the
ascendancy
which
the
dictator
finally
obtained
without
influence
in
the
national
assembly
he
gradually
became
the
master
of
the
convention
and
of
the
jacobins
when
he
reached
the
committee
of
public
safety
he
was
already
said
the
most
important
person
in
france
his
history
writes
michelet
is
prodigious
far
more
marvellous
than
that
of
bonaparte
the
threads
the
wheels
the
preparation
of
forces
are
far
less
visible
it
is
an
honest
man
an
austere
but
pious
figure
of
middling
talents
that
shoots
up
one
morning
borne
upward
by
i
know
not
what
cataclysm
there
is
nothing
like
it
in
the
arabian
nights
and
in
a
moment
he
goes
higher
than
the
throne
he
is
set
upon
the
altar
astonishing
story
certainly
circumstances
helped
him
considerably
people
turned
to
him
as
to
the
master
of
whom
all
felt
the
need
but
then
he
was
already
there
and
what
we
wish
to
discover
is
the
cause
of
his
rapid
ascent
i
would
willingly
suppose
in
him
the
existence
of
a
species
of
personal
fascination
which
escapes
us
his
successes
with
women
might
be
quoted
in
support
of
this
theory
on
the
days
when
he
speaks
the
passages
are
choked
with
women
there
are
seven
or
eight
hundred
in
the
tribunes
and
with
what
transports
they
applaud
at
the
jacobins
when
he
speaks
there
are
sobs
and
cries
of
emotion
and
men
stamp
as
though
they
would
bring
the
hall
down
a
young
widow
mme
de
chalabre
possessed
of
sixteen
hundred
pounds
a
year
sends
him
burning
and
is
eager
to
marry
him
we
can
not
seek
in
his
character
for
the
causes
of
his
popularity
a
hypochondriac
by
temperament
of
mediocre
intelligence
incapable
of
grasping
realities
confined
to
abstractions
crafty
and
dissimulating
his
prevailing
note
was
an
excessive
pride
which
increased
until
his
last
day
high
priest
of
a
new
faith
he
believed
himself
sent
on
earth
by
god
to
establish
the
reign
of
virtue
he
received
writings
stating
that
he
was
the
messiah
whom
the
eternal
being
had
promised
to
reform
the
world
full
of
literary
pretensions
he
laboriously
polished
his
speeches
his
profound
jealousy
of
other
orators
or
men
of
letters
such
as
camille
desmoulins
caused
their
death
those
who
were
particularly
the
objects
of
the
tyrant
rage
writes
the
author
already
cited
were
the
men
of
letters
with
regard
to
them
the
jealousy
of
a
colleague
was
mingled
with
the
fury
of
the
oppressor
for
the
hatred
with
which
he
persecuted
them
was
caused
less
by
their
resistance
to
his
despotism
than
by
their
talents
which
eclipsed
his
the
contempt
of
the
dictator
for
his
colleagues
was
immense
and
almost
unconcealed
giving
audience
to
barras
at
the
hour
of
his
toilet
he
finished
shaving
spitting
in
the
direction
of
his
colleague
as
though
he
did
not
exist
and
disdaining
to
reply
to
his
questions
he
regarded
the
bourgeoisie
and
the
deputies
with
the
same
hateful
disdain
only
the
multitude
found
grace
in
his
eyes
when
the
sovereign
people
exercises
its
power
he
said
we
can
only
bow
before
it
in
all
it
does
all
is
virtue
and
truth
and
no
excess
error
or
crime
is
possible
robespierre
suffered
from
the
persecution
mania
that
he
had
others
heads
cut
off
was
not
only
because
he
had
a
mission
as
an
apostle
but
because
he
believed
himself
hemmed
in
by
enemies
and
conspirators
great
as
was
the
cowardice
of
his
colleagues
where
he
was
concerned
writes
sorel
the
fear
he
had
of
them
was
still
greater
his
dictatorship
absolute
during
five
months
is
a
striking
example
of
the
power
of
certain
leaders
we
can
understand
that
a
tyrant
backed
by
an
army
can
easily
destroy
whom
he
pleases
but
that
a
single
man
should
succeed
in
sending
to
death
a
large
number
of
his
equals
is
a
thing
that
is
not
easily
explained
the
power
of
robespierre
was
so
absolute
that
he
was
able
to
send
to
the
tribunal
and
therefore
to
the
scaffold
the
most
eminent
deputies
desmoulins
hebert
danton
and
many
another
the
brilliant
girondists
melted
away
before
him
he
attacked
even
the
terrible
commune
guillotined
its
leaders
and
replaced
it
by
a
new
commune
obedient
to
his
orders
in
order
to
rid
himself
more
quickly
of
the
men
who
displeased
him
he
induced
the
convention
to
enact
the
law
of
prairial
which
permitted
the
execution
of
mere
suspects
and
by
means
of
which
he
had
heads
cut
off
in
paris
in
days
his
colleagues
the
victims
of
an
insane
terror
no
longer
slept
at
home
scarcely
a
hundred
deputies
were
present
at
sessions
david
said
i
do
not
believe
twenty
of
us
members
of
the
mountain
will
be
left
it
was
his
very
excess
of
confidence
in
his
own
powers
and
in
the
cowardice
of
the
convention
that
lost
robespierre
his
life
having
attempted
to
make
them
vote
a
measure
which
would
permit
deputies
to
be
sent
before
the
revolutionary
tribunal
which
meant
the
scaffold
without
the
authorisation
of
the
assembly
on
an
order
from
the
governing
committee
several
montagnards
conspired
with
some
members
of
the
plain
to
overthrow
him
tallien
knowing
himself
marked
down
for
early
execution
and
having
therefore
nothing
to
lose
accused
him
loudly
of
tyranny
robespierre
wished
to
defend
himself
by
reading
a
speech
which
he
had
long
had
in
hand
but
he
learned
to
his
cost
that
although
it
is
possible
to
destroy
men
in
the
name
of
logic
it
is
not
possible
to
lead
an
assembly
by
means
of
logic
the
shouts
of
the
conspirators
drowned
his
voice
the
cry
down
with
the
tyrant
quickly
repeated
thanks
to
mental
contagion
by
many
of
the
members
present
was
enough
to
complete
his
downfall
without
losing
a
moment
the
assembly
decreed
his
accusation
the
commune
having
wished
to
save
him
the
assembly
outlawed
him
struck
by
this
magic
formula
he
was
definitely
lost
this
cry
of
outlawry
writes
williams
at
this
period
produced
the
same
effect
on
a
frenchman
as
the
cry
of
pestilence
the
outlaw
became
civilly
excommunicated
and
it
was
as
though
men
believed
that
they
would
be
contaminated
passing
through
the
air
which
he
had
breathed
such
was
the
effect
it
produced
upon
the
gunners
who
had
trained
their
cannon
against
the
convention
without
receiving
further
orders
merely
on
hearing
that
the
commune
was
the
law
they
immediately
turned
their
batteries
about
robespierre
and
all
his
band
the
president
of
the
revolutionary
tribunal
the
mayor
of
the
commune
were
guillotined
on
the
of
thermidor
to
the
number
of
their
execution
was
followed
on
the
morrow
by
a
fresh
batch
of
seventy
jacobins
and
on
the
next
day
by
thirteen
the
terror
which
had
lasted
ten
months
was
at
an
end
the
downfall
of
the
jacobin
edifice
in
thermidor
is
one
of
the
most
curious
psychological
events
of
the
revolutionary
period
none
of
the
montagnards
who
had
worked
for
the
downfall
of
robespierre
had
for
a
moment
dreamed
that
it
would
mark
the
end
of
the
terror
tallien
barras
fouche
overthrew
robespierre
as
he
had
overthrown
hebert
danton
the
girondists
and
many
others
but
when
the
acclamations
of
the
crowd
told
them
that
the
death
of
robespierre
was
regarded
as
having
put
an
end
to
the
terror
they
acted
as
though
such
had
been
their
intention
they
were
the
more
obliged
to
do
so
in
that
the
plain
that
is
the
great
majority
of
the
assembly
which
had
allowed
itself
to
be
decimated
by
robespierre
now
rebelled
furiously
against
the
system
it
had
so
long
acclaimed
even
while
it
abhorred
it
nothing
is
more
terrible
than
a
body
of
men
who
have
been
afraid
and
are
afraid
no
longer
the
plain
revenged
itself
for
being
terrorised
by
the
mountain
and
terrorised
that
body
in
turn
the
servility
of
the
colleagues
of
robespierre
in
the
convention
was
by
no
means
based
upon
any
feeling
of
sympathy
for
him
the
dictator
filled
them
with
an
unspeakable
alarm
but
beneath
the
marks
of
admiration
and
enthusiasm
which
they
lavished
on
him
out
of
fear
was
concealed
an
intense
hatred
we
can
gather
as
much
by
reading
the
reports
of
various
deputies
inserted
in
the
moniteur
of
august
and
and
notably
that
on
the
conspiracy
of
the
triumvirs
robespierre
couthon
and
never
did
slaves
heap
such
invectives
on
a
fallen
master
we
learn
that
these
monsters
had
for
some
time
been
renewing
the
most
horrible
prescriptions
of
marius
and
sulla
robespierre
is
represented
as
a
most
frightful
scoundrel
we
are
assured
that
like
caligula
he
would
soon
have
asked
the
french
people
to
worship
his
horse
he
sought
security
in
the
execution
of
all
who
aroused
his
slightest
suspicion
these
reports
forget
to
add
that
the
power
of
robespierre
obtained
no
support
as
did
that
of
the
marius
and
sulla
to
whom
they
allude
from
a
powerful
army
but
merely
from
the
repeated
adhesion
of
the
members
of
the
convention
without
their
extreme
timidity
the
power
of
the
dictator
could
not
have
lasted
a
single
day
robespierre
was
one
of
the
most
odious
tyrants
of
history
but
he
is
distinguished
from
all
others
in
that
he
made
himself
a
tyrant
without
soldiers
we
may
sum
up
his
doctrines
by
saying
that
he
was
the
most
perfect
incarnation
save
perhaps
of
the
jacobin
faith
in
all
its
narrow
logic
its
intense
mysticism
and
its
inflexible
rigidity
he
has
admirers
even
hamel
describes
him
as
the
martyr
of
thermidor
there
has
been
some
talk
of
erecting
a
monument
to
him
i
would
willingly
subscribe
to
such
a
purpose
feeling
that
it
is
useful
to
preserve
proofs
of
the
blindness
of
the
crowd
and
of
the
extraordinary
docility
of
which
an
assembly
is
capable
when
the
leader
knows
how
to
handle
it
his
statue
would
recall
the
passionate
cries
of
admiration
and
enthusiasm
with
which
the
convention
acclaimed
the
most
threatening
measures
of
the
dictator
on
the
very
eve
of
the
day
when
it
was
about
to
cast
him
down
marat
i
shall
devote
a
paragraph
to
certain
revolutionists
who
were
famous
for
the
development
of
their
most
sanguinary
instincts
their
ferocity
was
complicated
by
other
sentiments
by
fear
and
hatred
which
could
but
fortify
it
the
public
prosecutor
of
the
revolutionary
tribunal
was
one
of
those
who
have
left
the
most
sinister
memories
this
magistrate
formerly
reputed
for
his
kindness
and
who
became
the
bloodthirsty
creature
whose
memory
evokes
such
repulsion
has
already
served
me
as
an
example
in
other
works
when
i
have
wished
to
show
the
transformation
of
certain
natures
in
time
of
revolution
needy
in
the
extreme
at
the
moment
of
the
fall
of
the
monarchy
he
had
everything
to
hope
from
a
social
upheaval
and
nothing
to
lose
he
was
one
of
those
men
whom
a
period
of
disorder
will
always
find
ready
to
sustain
it
the
convention
abandoned
its
powers
to
him
he
had
to
pronounce
upon
the
fate
of
nearly
two
thousand
accused
among
whom
were
the
girondists
danton
hebert
he
had
all
the
suspects
brought
before
him
executed
and
did
not
scruple
to
betray
his
former
protectors
as
soon
as
one
of
them
fell
into
his
power
camille
desmoulins
danton
or
another
he
would
plead
against
him
had
a
very
inferior
mind
which
the
revolution
brought
to
the
top
under
normal
conditions
hedged
about
by
professional
rules
his
destiny
would
have
been
that
of
a
peaceable
and
obscure
magistrate
this
was
precisely
the
lot
of
his
deputy
or
substitute
at
the
tribunal
he
should
writes
durel
have
inspired
the
same
horror
as
his
colleague
yet
he
completed
his
career
in
the
upper
ranks
of
the
imperial
magistracy
one
of
the
great
benefits
of
an
organised
society
is
that
it
does
restrain
these
dangerous
characters
whom
nothing
but
social
restraints
can
hold
died
without
understanding
why
he
was
condemned
and
from
the
revolutionary
point
of
view
his
condemnation
was
not
justifiable
had
he
not
merely
zealously
executed
the
orders
of
his
superiors
it
is
impossible
to
class
him
with
the
representatives
who
were
sent
into
the
provinces
who
could
not
be
supervised
the
delegates
of
the
convention
examined
all
his
sentences
and
approved
of
them
up
to
the
last
if
his
cruelty
and
his
summary
fashion
of
trying
the
prisoners
before
him
had
not
been
encouraged
by
his
chiefs
he
could
not
have
remained
in
power
in
condemning
the
convention
condemned
its
own
frightful
system
of
government
it
understood
this
fact
and
sent
to
the
scaffold
a
number
of
terrorists
whom
had
merely
served
as
a
faithful
agent
beside
we
may
set
dumas
who
presided
over
the
revolutionary
tribunal
and
who
also
displayed
an
excessive
cruelty
which
was
whetted
by
an
intense
fear
he
never
went
out
without
two
loaded
pistols
barricaded
himself
in
his
house
and
only
spoke
to
visitors
through
a
wicket
his
distrust
of
everybody
including
his
own
wife
was
absolute
he
even
imprisoned
the
latter
and
was
about
to
have
her
executed
when
thermidor
arrived
among
the
men
whom
the
convention
brought
to
light
varenne
was
one
of
the
wildest
and
most
brutal
he
may
be
regarded
as
a
perfect
type
of
bestial
ferocity
in
these
hours
of
fruitful
anger
and
heroic
anguish
he
remained
calm
acquitting
himself
methodically
of
his
task
and
it
was
a
frightful
task
he
appeared
officially
at
the
massacres
of
the
abbaye
congratulated
the
assassins
and
promised
them
money
upon
which
he
went
home
as
if
he
had
merely
been
taking
a
walk
we
see
him
as
president
of
the
jacobin
club
president
of
the
convention
and
member
of
the
committee
of
public
safety
he
drags
the
girondists
to
the
scaffold
he
drags
the
queen
thither
and
his
former
patron
danton
said
of
him
has
a
dagger
under
his
tongue
he
approves
of
the
cannonades
at
lyons
the
drownings
at
nantes
the
massacres
at
arras
he
organises
the
pitiless
commission
of
orange
he
is
concerned
in
the
laws
of
prairial
he
eggs
on
on
all
decrees
of
death
is
his
name
often
the
first
he
signs
before
his
colleagues
he
is
without
pity
without
emotion
without
enthusiasm
when
others
are
frightened
hesitate
and
draw
back
he
goes
his
way
speaking
in
turgid
sentences
his
lion
mane
for
to
make
his
cold
and
impassive
face
more
in
harmony
with
the
exuberance
that
surrounds
him
he
now
decks
himself
in
a
yellow
wig
which
would
make
one
laugh
were
it
on
any
but
the
sinister
head
of
when
robespierre
and
couthon
are
threatened
in
turn
he
deserts
them
and
goes
over
to
the
enemy
and
pushes
them
under
the
knife
why
what
is
his
aim
no
one
knows
he
is
not
in
any
way
ambitious
he
desires
neither
power
nor
money
i
do
not
think
it
would
be
difficult
to
answer
why
the
thirst
for
blood
of
which
we
have
already
spoken
and
which
is
very
common
among
certain
criminals
perfectly
explains
the
conduct
of
bandits
of
this
type
kill
for
the
sake
of
killing
as
sportsmen
shoot
game
for
the
very
pleasure
of
exercising
their
taste
for
destruction
in
ordinary
times
men
endowed
with
these
homicidal
tendencies
refrain
generally
from
fear
of
the
policeman
and
the
scaffold
when
they
are
able
to
give
them
free
vent
nothing
can
stop
them
such
was
the
case
with
and
many
others
the
psychology
of
marat
is
rather
more
complicated
not
only
because
his
craving
for
murder
was
combined
with
other
elements
wounded
ambition
mystic
beliefs
but
also
because
we
must
regard
him
as
a
affected
by
megalomania
and
haunted
by
fixed
ideas
before
the
revolution
he
had
advanced
great
scientific
pretensions
but
no
one
attached
much
importance
to
his
maunderings
dreaming
of
place
and
honour
he
had
only
obtained
a
very
subordinate
situation
in
the
household
of
a
great
noble
the
revolution
opened
up
an
future
swollen
with
hatred
of
the
old
social
system
which
had
not
recognised
his
merits
he
put
himself
at
the
head
of
the
most
violent
section
of
the
people
having
publicly
glorified
the
massacres
of
september
he
founded
a
journal
which
denounced
everybody
and
clamoured
incessantly
for
executions
speaking
continually
of
the
interests
of
the
people
marat
became
their
idol
the
majority
of
his
colleagues
heartily
despised
him
had
he
escaped
the
knife
of
charlotte
corday
he
certainly
would
not
have
escaped
that
of
the
guillotine
the
destiny
of
those
members
of
the
convention
who
survived
the
revolution
beside
the
members
of
the
convention
whose
psychology
presents
particular
characteristics
there
were
others
barras
fouche
tallien
merlin
de
thionville
completely
devoid
of
principles
or
belief
who
only
sought
to
enrich
themselves
they
sought
to
build
up
enormous
fortunes
out
of
the
public
misery
in
ordinary
times
they
would
have
been
qualified
as
simple
scoundrels
but
in
periods
of
revolution
all
standards
of
vice
and
virtue
seem
to
disappear
although
a
few
jacobins
remained
fanatics
the
majority
renounced
their
convictions
as
soon
as
they
had
obtained
riches
and
became
the
faithful
courtiers
of
napoleon
cambaceres
who
on
addressing
louis
xvi
in
prison
called
him
louis
capet
under
the
empire
required
his
friends
to
call
him
highness
in
public
and
monseigneur
in
private
thus
displaying
the
envious
feeling
which
accompanied
the
craving
for
equality
in
many
of
the
jacobins
the
majority
of
the
jacobins
writes
madelin
were
greatly
enriched
and
like
chabot
bazire
merlin
barras
boursault
tallien
barrere
possessed
chateaux
and
estates
those
who
were
not
wealthy
as
yet
were
soon
to
become
so
in
the
committee
of
the
year

the
staff
of
the
thermidorian

comprised
a
future

future

of

and
beside
them
in

fouche
died
worth
the
privileges
of
the
ancien

which
had
been
so
bitterly
decried
were
thus
very
soon
for
the
benefit
of
the
bourgeoisie
to
arrive
at
this
result
it
was
necessary
to
ruin
france
to
burn
entire
provinces
to
multiply
suffering
to
plunge
innumerable
families
into
despair
to
overturn
europe
and
to
destroy
men
by
the
hundred
thousand
on
the
field
of
battle
in
closing
this
chapter
we
will
recall
what
we
have
already
said
concerning
the
possibility
of
judging
the
men
of
this
period
although
the
moralist
is
forced
to
deal
severely
with
certain
individuals
because
he
judges
them
by
the
types
which
society
must
respect
if
it
is
to
succeed
in
maintaining
itself
the
psychologist
is
not
in
the
same
case
his
aim
is
to
understand
and
criticism
vanishes
before
a
complete
comprehension
the
human
mind
is
a
very
fragile
mechanism
and
the
marionettes
which
dance
upon
the
stage
of
history
are
rarely
able
to
resist
the
imperious
forces
which
impel
them
heredity
environment
and
circumstances
are
imperious
masters
no
one
can
say
with
certainty
what
would
have
been
his
conduct
in
the
place
of
the
men
whose
actions
he
endeavours
to
interpret
book
iii
the
conflict
between
ancestral
influences
and
revolutionary
principles
chapter
i
the
last
convulsions
of
anarchy
the
directory
the
psychology
of
the
directory
as
the
various
revolutionary
assemblies
were
composed
in
part
of
the
same
men
one
might
suppose
that
their
psychology
would
be
very
similar
at
ordinary
periods
this
would
have
been
so
for
a
constant
environment
means
constancy
of
character
but
when
circumstances
change
as
rapidly
as
they
did
under
the
revolution
character
must
perforce
transform
itself
to
adapt
itself
thereto
such
was
the
case
with
the
directory
the
directory
comprised
several
distinct
assemblies
two
large
chambers
consisting
of
different
categories
of
deputies
and
one
very
small
chamber
which
consisted
of
the
five
directors
the
two
larger
assemblies
remind
one
strongly
of
the
convention
by
their
weakness
they
were
no
longer
forced
to
obey
popular
riots
as
these
were
energetically
prevented
by
the
directors
but
they
yielded
without
discussion
to
the
dictatorial
injunctions
of
the
latter
the
first
deputies
to
be
elected
were
mostly
moderates
everyone
was
weary
of
the
jacobin
tyranny
the
new
assembly
dreamed
of
rebuilding
the
ruins
with
which
france
was
covered
and
establishing
a
liberal
government
without
violence
but
by
one
of
those
fatalities
which
were
a
law
of
the
revolution
and
which
prove
that
the
course
of
events
is
often
superior
to
men
wills
these
deputies
like
their
predecessors
may
be
said
always
to
have
done
the
contrary
of
what
they
wished
to
do
they
hoped
to
be
moderate
and
they
were
violent
they
wanted
to
eliminate
the
influence
of
the
jacobins
and
they
allowed
themselves
to
be
led
by
them
they
thought
to
repair
the
ruins
of
the
country
and
they
succeeded
only
in
adding
others
to
them
they
aspired
to
religious
peace
and
they
finally
persecuted
and
massacred
the
priests
with
greater
rigour
than
during
the
terror
the
psychology
of
the
little
assembly
formed
by
the
five
directors
was
very
different
from
that
of
the
chamber
of
deputies
encountering
fresh
difficulties
daily
the
directors
were
forced
to
resolve
them
while
the
large
assemblies
without
contact
with
realities
had
only
their
aspirations
the
prevailing
thought
of
the
directors
was
very
simple
highly
indifferent
to
principles
they
wished
above
all
to
remain
the
masters
of
france
to
attain
that
result
they
did
not
shrink
from
resorting
to
the
most
illegitimate
measures
even
annulling
the
elections
of
a
great
number
of
the
departments
when
these
embarrassed
them
feeling
themselves
incapable
of
reorganising
france
they
left
her
to
herself
by
their
despotism
they
contrived
to
dominate
her
but
they
never
governed
her
now
what
france
needed
more
than
anything
at
this
juncture
was
to
be
governed
the
convention
has
left
behind
it
the
reputation
of
a
strong
government
and
the
directory
that
of
a
weak
government
the
contrary
is
true
it
was
the
directory
that
was
the
strong
government
psychologically
we
may
readily
explain
the
difference
between
the
government
of
the
directory
and
that
of
the
preceding
assemblies
by
recalling
the
fact
that
a
gathering
of
six
hundred
to
seven
hundred
persons
may
well
suffer
from
waves
of
contagious
enthusiasm
as
on
the
night
of
the
of
august
or
even
impulses
of
energetic
such
as
that
which
launched
defiance
against
the
kings
of
europe
but
such
impulses
are
too
ephemeral
to
possess
any
great
force
a
committee
of
five
members
easily
dominated
by
the
will
of
one
is
far
more
susceptible
of
continuous
resolution
that
is
of
perseverance
in
a
settled
line
of
conduct
the
government
of
the
directory
proved
to
be
always
incapable
of
governing
but
it
never
lacked
a
strong
will
nothing
restraining
it
neither
respect
for
law
nor
consideration
for
the
citizens
nor
love
of
the
public
welfare
it
was
able
to
impose
upon
france
a
despotism
more
crushing
than
that
of
any
government
since
the
beginning
of
the
revolution
not
excepting
the
terror
although
it
utilised
methods
analogous
to
those
of
the
convention
and
ruled
france
in
the
most
tyrannical
manner
the
directory
no
more
than
the
convention
was
never
the
master
of
france
this
fact
which
i
have
already
noted
proves
once
more
the
impotence
of
material
constraint
to
dominate
moral
forces
it
can
not
be
too
often
repeated
that
the
true
guide
of
mankind
is
the
moral
scaffolding
erected
by
his
ancestors
accustomed
to
live
in
an
organised
society
supported
by
codes
and
respected
traditions
we
can
with
difficulty
represent
to
ourselves
the
condition
of
a
nation
deprived
of
such
a
basis
as
a
general
thing
we
only
see
the
irksome
side
of
our
environment
too
readily
forgetting
that
society
can
exist
only
on
condition
of
imposing
certain
restraints
and
that
laws
manners
and
custom
constitute
a
check
upon
the
natural
instincts
of
barbarism
which
never
entirely
perishes
the
history
of
the
convention
and
the
directory
which
followed
it
shows
plainly
to
what
degree
disorder
may
overcome
a
nation
deprived
of
its
ancient
structure
and
having
for
guide
only
the
artificial
combinations
of
an
insufficient
reason
despotic
government
of
the
directory
recrudescence
of
the
terror
with
the
object
of
diverting
attention
occupying
the
army
and
obtaining
resources
by
the
pillage
of
neighbouring
countries
the
directors
decided
to
resume
the
wars
of
conquest
which
had
succeeded
under
the
convention
these
continued
during
the
life
time
of
the
directory
the
armies
won
a
rich
booty
especially
in
italy
some
of
the
invaded
populations
were
so
simple
as
to
suppose
that
these
invasions
were
undertaken
in
their
interest
they
were
not
long
in
discovering
that
all
military
operations
were
accompanied
by
crushing
taxes
and
the
pillage
of
churches
public
treasuries
the
final
consequence
of
this
policy
of
conquest
was
the
formation
of
a
new
coalition
against

lasted
until
indifferent
to
the
state
of
the

incapable
of

the

were
principally
concerned
in
struggling
against
an
incessant
series
of
conspiracies

to

others

for

only
the
purchasers

feared
a

the
unpopularity
of
the
directory
increased
daily
and
when
in
may
the
third
part
of
the
assembly
had
to
be
renewed
the
majority
of
those
elected
were
hostile
to
the
system
the
directors
were
not
embarrassed
by
a
little
thing
like
that
they
annulled
the
elections
in
departments
of
the
new
deputies
were
invalidated

the

were
violently

this
was
known
as
the
coup
of

this
coup
which
struck
more
especially
at
the
moderates
was
not
the
only
one
of
its
kind
another
quickly
followed
the
directors
finding
the
jacobin
deputies
too
numerous
annulled
the

of
sixty
of

the
preceding
facts
displayed
the
tyrannical
temper
of
the
directors
but
this
appeared
even
more
plainly
in
the
details
of
their
measures
the
new
masters
of
france
also
proved
to
be
as
bloodthirsty
as
the
most
ferocious

the

the
terror
was
in
reality
completely
the
autocratic
despotism
of
the
directory
was
exercised
in
all
the
branches
of
the
administration
notably
the
finances
thus
having
need
of
six
hundred
million
francs
it
forced
the
deputies
always
docile
to
vote
a
progressive
impost
which
yielded
however
only
twelve
millions
being
presently
in
the
same
condition
it
decreed
a
forced
loan
of
a
hundred
millions
which
resulted
in
the
closing
of
workshops
the
stoppage
of
business
and
the
dismissal
of
domestics
it
was
only
at
the
price
of
absolute
ruin
that
forty
millions
could
be
obtained
to
assure
itself
of
domination
in
the
provinces
the
directory
caused
a
law
of
hostages
to
be
passed
according
to
which
a
list
of
hostages
responsible
for
all
offences
was
drawn
up
in
each
commune
it
is
easy
to
understand
what
hatred
such
a
system
provoked
at
the
end
of
fourteen
departments
were
in
revolt
and
were
ready
to
rise
if
the
directory
had
lasted
the
dissolution
of

would
have
been
complete
for
that
matter
this
dissolution
was

advanced

everything
was
crumbling
the
receipts
of
the
treasury
consisting
of
depreciated
assignats
fallen
to
a
hundredth
part
of
their
original
value
were
negligible
holders
of
government
stock
and
officers
could
no
longer
obtain
payment
france
at
this
time
gave
travellers
the
impression
of
a
country
ravaged
by
war
and
abandoned
by
its
inhabitants
the
broken
bridges
and
dykes
and
ruined
buildings
made
all
traffic
impossible
the
roads
long
deserted
were
infested
by
brigands
certain
departments
could
only
be
crossed
at
the
price
of
buying
a
from
the

of
these

lyons
marseilles
were

poverty

were

the
moral
disorganisation
was
no
less
terrible
luxury
and
the
craving
for
pleasure
costly
dinners
jewels
and
extravagant
households
were
the
appanage
of
a
new
society
composed
entirely
of
army
contractors
and
shady
financiers
enriched
by
pillage
they
gave
paris
that
superficial
aspect
of
luxury
and
gaiety
which
has
deluded
so
many
historians
of
this
period
because
the
insolent
prodigality
displayed
covered
the
general
misery
the
chronicles
of
the
directory
as
told
in
books
help
to
show
us
of
what
lies
the
web
of
history
is
woven
the
theatre
has
lately
got
hold
of
this
period
of
which
the
fashions
are
still
imitated
it
has
left
the
memory
of
a
joyous
period
of
after
the
gloomy
drama
of
the
terror
in
reality
the
drama
of
the
directory
was
hardly
an
improvement
on
the
terror
and
was
quite
as
sanguinary
finally
it
inspired
such
loathing
that
the
directors
feeling
that
it
could
not
last
sought
themselves
for
the
dictator
capable
of
replacing
it
and
also
of
protecting
them
the
advent
of
bonaparte
we
have
seen
that
at
the
end
of
the
directory
the
anarchy
and
disorganisation
were
such
that
every
one
was
desperately
calling
for
the
man
of
energy
capable
of
order
as
early
as
a
number
of
deputies
had
thought
for
a
moment
of
establishing
royalty
louis
having
been
tactless
enough
to
declare
that
he
would
restore
the
ancien
regime
in
its
entirety
return
all
property
to
its
original
owners
and
punish
the
men
of
the
revolution
was
immediately
thrown
over
the
senseless
expedition
of
quiberon
finally
alienated
the
supporters
of
the
future
sovereign
the
royalists
gave
a
proof
during
the
whole
of
the
revolution
of
an
incapacity
and
a
narrowness
of
mind
which
justified
most
of
the
measures
taken
against
them
the
monarchy
being
impossible
it
was
necessary
to
find
a
general
only
one
existed
whose
name
carried
weight
bonaparte
the
campaign
in
italy
had
just
made
him
famous
having
crossed
the
alps
he
had
marched
from
victory
to
victory
penetrated
to
milan
and
venice
and
everywhere
obtained
important
war
contributions
he
then
made
towards
vienna
and
was
only
five
leagues
from
its
gates
when
the
emperor
of
austria
decided
to
sue
for
peace
but
great
as
was
his
renown
the
young
general
did
not
consider
it
sufficient
to
increase
it
he
persuaded
the
directory
that
the
power
of
england
could
be
shaken
by
an
invasion
of
egypt
and
in
may
he
embarked
at
toulon
this
need
of
increasing
his
prestige
arose
from
a
very
sound
psychological
conception
which
he
clearly
expounded
at
helena
the
most
influential
and
enlightened
generals
had
long
been
pressing
the
general
of
italy
to
take
steps
to
place
himself
at
the
head
of
the
republic
he
refused
he
was
not
yet
strong
enough
to
walk
quite
alone
he
had
ideas
upon
the
art
of
governing
and
upon
what
was
necessary
to
a
great
nation
which
were
so
different
from
those
of
the
men
of
the
revolution
and
the
assemblies
that
not
being
able
to
act
alone
he
feared
to
compromise
his
character
he
determined
to
set
out
for
egypt
but
resolved
to
reappear
if
circumstances
should
arise
to
render
his
presence
useful
or
necessary
bonaparte
did
not
stay
long
in
egypt
recalled
by
his
friends
he
landed
at
frejus
and
the
announcement
of
his
return
provoked
universal
enthusiasm
there
were
illuminations
everywhere
france
collaborated
in
advance
in
the
coup
prepared
by
two
directors
and
the
principal
ministers
the
plot
was
organised
in
three
weeks
its
execution
on
the
of
brumaire
was
accomplished
with
the
greatest
ease
all
parties
experienced
the
greatest
delight
at
being
rid
of
the
sinister
gangs
who
had
so
long
oppressed
and
exploited
the
country
the
french
were
doubtless
about
to
enter
upon
a
despotic
system
of
government
but
it
could
not
be
so
intolerable
as
that
which
had
been
endured
for
so
many
years
the
history
of
the
coup
of
brumaire
justifies
all
that
we
have
already
said
of
the
impossibility
of
forming
exact
judgments
of
events
which
apparently
are
fully
understood
and
attested
by
no
matter
how
many
witnesses
we
know
what
ideas
people
had
thirty
years
ago
concerning
the
coup
of
brumaire
it
was
regarded
as
a
crime
committed
by
the
ambition
of
a
man
who
was
supported
by
his
army
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
army
played
no
part
whatever
in
the
affair
the
little
body
of
men
who
expelled
the
few
recalcitrant
deputies
were
not
soldiers
even
but
the
gendarmes
of
the
assembly
itself
the
true
author
of
the
coup
was
the
government
itself
with
the
complicity
of
all
france
causes
of
the
duration
of
the
revolution
if
we
limit
the
revolution
to
the
time
necessary
for
the
conquest
of
its
fundamental
principles
equality
before
the
law
free
access
to
public
functions
popular
sovereignty
control
of
expenditures
we
may
say
that
it
lasted
only
a
few
months
towards
the
middle
of
all
this
was
accomplished
and
during
the
years
that
followed
nothing
was
added
to
it
yet
the
revolution
lasted
much
longer
confining
the
duration
to
the
dates
admitted
by
the
official
historians
we
see
it
persisting
until
the
advent
of
bonaparte
a
space
of
some
ten
years
why
did
this
period
of
disorganisation
and
violence
follow
the
establishment
of
the
new
principles
we
need
not
seek
the
cause
in
the
foreign
war
which
might
on
several
occasions
have
been
terminated
thanks
to
the
divisions
of
the
allies
and
the
constant
victories
of
the
french
neither
must
we
look
for
it
in
the
sympathy
of
frenchmen
for
the
revolutionary
government
never
was
rule
more
cordially
hated
and
despised
than
that
of
the
assemblies
by
its
revolts
as
well
as
by
its
repeated
votes
a
great
part
of
the
nation
displayed
the
horror
with
which
it
regarded
the
system
this
last
point
the
aversion
of
france
for
the
revolutionary
regime
so
long
misunderstood
has
been
well
displayed
by
recent
historians
the
author
of
the
last
book
published
on
the
revolution
madelin
has
well
summarised
their
opinion
in
the
following
words
as
early
as
a
party
by
no
means
numerous
had
seized
upon
france
the
revolution
and
the
republic
now
of
france
longed
for
the
revolution
to
be
checked
or
rather
delivered
from
its
odious
exploiters
but
these
held
the
unhappy
country
by
a
thousand
means
as
the
terror
was
essential
to
them
if
they
were
to
rule
they
struck
at
whomsoever
seemed
at
any
given
moment
to
be
opposed
to
the
terror
were
they
the
best
servants
of
the
revolution
up
to
the
end
of
the
directory
the
government
was
exercised
by
jacobins
who
merely
desired
to
retain
along
with
the
supreme
power
the
riches
they
had
accumulated
by
murder
and
pillage
and
were
ready
to
surrender
france
to
any
one
who
would
guarantee
them
free
possession
of
these
that
they
negotiated
the
coup
of
brumaire
with
napoleon
was
simply
to
the
fact
that
they
had
not
been
able
to
realise
their
wishes
with
regard
to
louis
xviii
but
how
explain
the
fact
that
a
government
so
tyrannical
and
so
dishonoured
was
able
to
survive
for
so
many
years
it
was
not
merely
because
the
revolutionary
religion
still
survived
in
men
minds
nor
because
it
was
forced
on
them
by
means
of
persecution
and
bloodshed
but
especially
as
i
have
already
stated
on
account
of
the
great
interest
which
a
large
portion
of
the
population
had
in
maintaining
it
this
point
is
fundamental
if
the
revolution
had
remained
a
theoretical
religion
it
would
probably
have
been
of
short
duration
but
the
belief
which
had
just
been
founded
very
quickly
emerged
from
the
domain
of
pure
theory
the
revolution
did
not
confine
itself
to
despoiling
the
monarchy
the
nobility
and
the
clergy
of
their
powers
of
government
in
throwing
into
the
hands
of
the
bourgeoisie
and
the
large
numbers
of
peasantry
the
wealth
and
the
employments
of
the
old
privileged
classes
it
had
at
the
same
stroke
turned
them
into
obstinate
supporters
of
the
revolutionary
system
all
those
who
had
acquired
the
property
of
which
the
nobles
and
clergy
had
been
despoiled
had
obtained
lands
and
chateaux
at
low
prices
and
were
terrified
lest
the
restoration
of
the
monarchy
should
force
them
to
make
general
restitution
it
was
largely
for
these
reasons
that
a
government
which
at
any
normal
period
would
never
have
been
endured
was
able
to
survive
until
a
master
should
order
while
promising
to
maintain
not
only
the
moral
but
also
the
material
conquests
of
the
revolution
bonaparte
realised
these
anxieties
and
was
promptly
and
enthusiastically
welcomed
material
conquests
which
were
still
contestable
and
theoretical
principles
which
were
still
fragile
were
by
him
incorporated
in
institutions
and
the
laws
it
is
an
error
to
say
that
the
revolution
terminated
with
his
advent
far
from
destroying
it
he
ratified
and
consolidated
it
chapter
ii
the
restoration
of
order
the
consular
republic
how
the
work
of
the
revolution
was
confirmed
by
the
consulate
the
history
of
the
consulate
is
as
rich
as
the
preceding
period
in
psychological
material
in
the
first
place
it
shows
us
that
the
work
of
a
powerful
individual
is
superior
to
that
of
a
collectivity
bonaparte
immediately
replaced
the
bloody
anarchy
in
which
the
republic
had
for
ten
years
been
writhing
by
a
period
of
order
that
which
none
of
the
four
assemblies
of
the
revolution
had
been
able
to
realise
despite
the
most
violent
oppression
a
single
man
accomplished
in
a
very
short
space
of
time
his
authority
immediately
put
an
end
to
all
the
parisian
insurrections
and
the
attempts
at
monarchical
resistance
and
established
the
moral
unity
of
france
so
profoundly
divided
by
intense
hatreds
bonaparte
replaced
an
unorganised
collective
despotism
by
a
perfectly
organised
individual
despotism
everyone
gained
thereby
for
his
tyranny
was
infinitely
less
heavy
than
that
which
had
been
endured
for
ten
long
years
we
must
suppose
moreover
that
it
was
unwelcome
to
very
few
as
it
was
very
soon
accepted
with
immense
enthusiasm
we
know
better
than
to
repeat
with
the
old
historians
that
bonaparte
overthrew
the
republic
on
the
contrary
he
retained
of
it
all
that
could
be
retained
and
never
would
have
been
retained
without
him
by
establishing
all
the
practicable
work
of
the
revolution
the
abolition
of
privileges
equality
before
the
law
in
institutions
and
codes
of
law
the
consular
government
continued
moreover
to
call
itself
the
republic
it
is
infinitely
probable
that
without
the
consulate
a
monarchical
restoration
would
have
terminated
the
directory
and
would
have
wiped
out
the
greater
part
of
the
work
of
the
revolution
let
us
suppose
bonaparte
erased
from
history
no
one
i
think
will
imagine
that
the
directory
could
have
survived
the
universal
weariness
of
its
rule
it
would
certainly
have
been
overturned
by
the
royalist
conspiracies
which
were
breaking
out
daily
and
louis
xviii
would
probably
have
ascended
the
throne
certainly
he
was
to
mount
it
sixteen
years
later
but
during
this
interval
bonaparte
gave
such
force
to
the
principles
of
the
revolution
by
establishing
them
in
laws
and
customs
that
the
restored
sovereign
dared
not
touch
them
nor
restore
the
property
of
the
returned
emigres
matters
would
have
been
very
different
had
louis
xviii
immediately
followed
the
directory
he
would
have
brought
with
him
all
the
absolutism
of
the
ancien
regime
and
fresh
revolutions
would
have
been
necessary
to
abolish
it
we
know
that
a
mere
attempt
to
return
to
the
past
overthrew
charles
x
it
would
be
a
little
ingenuous
to
complain
of
the
tyranny
of
bonaparte
under
the
ancien
regime
frenchmen
had
supported
every
species
of
tyranny
and
the
republic
had
created
a
despotism
even
heavier
than
that
of
the
monarchy
despotism
was
then
a
normal
condition
which
aroused
no
protest
save
when
it
was
accompanied
by
disorder
a
constant
law
of
the
psychology
of
crowds
shows
them
as
creating
anarchy
and
then
seeking
the
master
who
will
enable
them
to
emerge
therefrom
bonaparte
was
this
master
the
reorganisation
of
france
by
the
consulate
upon
assuming
power
bonaparte
undertook
a
colossal
task
all
was
in
ruins
all
was
to
be
rebuilt
on
the
morrow
of
the
coup
of
brumaire
he
drafted
almost
the
constitution
destined
to
give
him
the
absolute
power
which
was
to
enable
him
to
reorganise
the
country
and
to
prevail
over
the
factions
in
a
month
it
was
completed
this
constitution
known
as
that
of
the
year
survived
with
slight
modifications
until
the
end
of
his
reign
the
executive
power
was
the
attribute
of
three
consuls
two
of
whom
possessed
a
consultative
voice
only
the
first
consul
bonaparte
was
therefore
sole
master
of
france
he
appointed
ministers
councillors
of
state
ambassadors
magistrates
and
other
officials
and
decided
upon
peace
or
war
the
legislative
power
was
his
also
since
only
he
could
initiate
the
laws
which
were
subsequently
submitted
to
three
assemblies
the
council
of
state
the
tribunate
and
the
legislative
corps
a
fourth
assembly
the
senate
acted
effectually
as
the
guardian
of
the
constitution
despotic
as
he
was
and
became
bonaparte
always
called
the
other
consuls
about
him
before
proceeding
with
the
most
trivial
measure
the
legislative
corps
did
not
exercise
much
influence
during
his
reign
but
he
signed
no
decrees
of
any
kind
without
first
discussing
them
with
the
council
of
state
this
council
composed
of
the
most
enlightened
and
learned
men
of
france
prepared
laws
which
were
then
presented
to
the
legislative
corps
which
could
criticise
them
very
freely
since
voting
was
secret
presided
over
by
bonaparte
the
council
of
state
was
a
kind
of
sovereign
tribunal
judging
even
the
actions
of
ministers
napoleon
naturally
often
overruled
the
council
of
state
but
by
no
means
always
did
so
in
one
instance
reported
in
the
memorial
de
he
was
the
only
one
of
his
own
opinion
and
accepted
that
of
the
majority
in
the
following
terms
gentlemen
matters
are
decided
here
by
majority
and
being
alone
i
must
give
way
but
i
declare
that
in
my
conscience
i
yield
only
to
form
you
have
reduced
me
to
silence
but
in
no
way
convinced
me
another
day
the
emperor
interrupted
three
times
in
the
expression
of
his
opinion
addressed
himself
to
the
speaker
who
had
just
interrupted
him
sir
i
have
not
yet
finished
i
beg
you
to
allow
me
to
continue
after
all
it
seems
to
me
that
every
one
has
a
perfect
right
to
express
his
opinion
here
the
emperor
contrary
to
the
accepted
opinion
was
so
far
from
absolute
and
so
easy
with
his
council
of
state
that
he
often
resumed
a
discussion
or
even
annulled
a
decision
because
one
of
the
members
of
the
council
had
since
in
private
given
him
fresh
reasons
or
had
urged
that
the
emperor
personal
opinion
had
influenced
the
majority
the
new
master
had
great
confidence
in
this
council
as
it
was
composed
more
particularly
of
eminent
jurists
each
of
whom
dealt
with
his
own
speciality
he
was
too
good
a
psychologist
not
to
entertain
the
greatest
suspicion
of
large
and
incompetent
assemblies
of
popular
origin
whose
disastrous
results
had
been
obvious
to
him
during
the
whole
of
the
revolution
wishing
to
govern
for
the
people
but
never
with
its
assistance
bonaparte
accorded
it
no
part
in
the
government
reserving
to
it
only
the
right
of
voting
once
for
all
for
or
against
the
adoption
of
the
new
constitution
he
only
in
rare
instances
had
recourse
to
universal
suffrage
the
members
of
the
legislative
corps
recruited
themselves
and
were
not
elected
by
the
people
in
creating
a
constitution
intended
solely
to
fortify
his
own
power
the
first
consul
had
no
illusion
that
it
would
serve
to
restore
the
country
consequently
while
he
was
drafting
it
he
also
undertook
the
enormous
task
of
the
administrative
judicial
and
financial
reorganisation
of
france
the
various
powers
were
centralised
in
paris
each
department
was
directed
by
a
prefect
assisted
by
a
the
arrondissement
by
a
prefect
assisted
by
a
council
the
commune
by
a
mayor
assisted
by
a
municipal
council
all
were
appointed
by
the
ministers
and
not
by
election
as
under
the
republic
this
system
which
created
the
omnipotent
state
and
a
powerful
centralisation
was
retained
by
all
subsequent
governments
and
is
preserved
centralisation
being
in
spite
of
its
drawbacks
the
only
means
of
avoiding
local
tyrannies
in
a
country
profoundly
divided
within
itself
has
always
been
maintained
this
organisation
based
on
a
profound
knowledge
of
the
soul
of
the
french
people
immediately
restored
that
tranquillity
and
order
which
had
for
so
long
been
unknown
to
complete
the
mental
pacification
of
the
country
the
political
exiles
were
recalled
and
the
churches
restored
to
the
faithful
continuing
to
rebuild
the
social
edifice
bonaparte
busied
himself
also
with
the
drafting
of
a
code
the
greater
part
of
which
consisted
of
customs
borrowed
from
the
ancien
regime
it
was
as
has
been
said
a
sort
of
transition
or
compromise
between
the
old
law
and
the
new
considering
the
enormous
task
accomplished
by
the
first
consul
in
so
short
a
time
we
realise
that
he
had
need
before
all
of
a
constitution
according
him
absolute
power
if
all
the
measures
by
which
he
restored
france
had
been
submitted
to
assemblies
of
attorneys
he
could
never
have
extricated
the
country
from
the
disorder
into
which
it
had
fallen
the
constitution
of
the
year
viii
obviously
transformed
the
republic
into
a
monarchy
at
least
as
absolute
as
the
divine
right
monarchy
of
louis
xiv
being
the
only
constitution
adapted
to
the
needs
of
the
moment
it
represented
a
psychological
necessity
psychological
elements
which
determined
the
success
of
the
work
of
the
consulate
all
the
external
forces
which
act
upon
men
economic
historical
geographical
may
be
finally
translated
into
psychological
forces
these
psychological
forces
a
ruler
must
understand
in
order
to
govern
the
revolutionary
assemblies
were
completely
ignorant
of
them
bonaparte
knew
how
to
employ
them
the
various
assemblies
the
convention
notably
were
composed
of
conflicting
parties
napoleon
understood
that
to
dominate
them
he
must
not
belong
to
any
one
of
these
parties
very
well
aware
that
the
value
of
a
country
is
disseminated
among
the
superior
intelligences
of
the
various
parties
he
tried
to
utilise
them
all
his
agents
of
government
ministers
priests
magistrates
were
taken
indifferently
from
among
the
liberals
royalists
jacobites
having
regard
only
to
their
capacities
while
accepting
the
assistance
of
men
of
the
ancien
regime
bonaparte
took
care
to
make
it
understood
that
he
intended
to
maintain
the
fundamental
principles
of
the
revolution
nevertheless
many
royalists
rallied
round
the
new
government
one
of
the
most
remarkable
feats
of
the
consulate
from
the
psychological
point
of
view
was
the
restoration
of
religious
peace
france
was
far
more
divided
by
religious
disagreement
than
by
political
differences
the
systematic
destruction
of
a
portion
of
the
vendee
had
almost
completely
terminated
the
struggle
by
force
of
arms
but
without
pacifying
men
minds
as
only
one
man
and
he
the
head
of
christianity
could
assist
in
this
pacification
bonaparte
did
not
hesitate
to
treat
with
him
his
concordat
was
the
work
of
a
real
psychologist
who
knew
that
moral
forces
do
not
use
violence
and
the
great
danger
of
persecuting
such
while
conciliating
the
clergy
he
contrived
to
place
them
under
his
own
domination
the
bishops
were
to
be
appointed
and
remunerated
by
the
state
so
that
he
would
still
be
master
the
religious
policy
of
napoleon
had
a
bearing
which
escapes
our
modern
jacobins
blinded
by
their
narrow
fanaticism
they
do
not
understand
that
to
detach
the
church
from
the
government
is
to
create
a
state
within
the
state
so
that
they
are
liable
to
find
themselves
opposed
by
a
formidable
caste
directed
by
a
master
outside
france
and
necessarily
hostile
to
france
to
give
enemies
a
liberty
they
did
not
possess
is
extremely
dangerous
never
would
napoleon
nor
any
of
the
sovereigns
who
preceded
him
have
consented
to
make
the
clergy
independent
of
the
state
as
they
have
become
the
difficulties
of
bonaparte
the
first
consul
were
far
greater
than
those
he
had
to
surmount
after
his
coronation
only
a
profound
knowledge
of
men
enabled
him
to
triumph
over
them
the
future
master
was
far
from
being
the
master
as
yet
many
departments
were
still
in
insurrection
brigandage
persisted
and
the
midi
was
ravaged
by
the
struggles
of
partisans
bonaparte
as
consul
had
to
conciliate
and
handle
talleyrand
fouche
and
a
number
of
generals
who
thought
themselves
his
equal
even
his
brothers
conspired
against
his
power
napoleon
as
emperor
had
no
hostile
party
to
face
but
as
consul
he
had
to
combat
all
the
parties
and
to
hold
the
balance
equal
among
them
this
must
indeed
have
been
a
difficult
task
since
during
the
last
century
very
few
governments
have
succeeded
in
accomplishing
it
the
success
of
such
an
undertaking
demanded
an
extremely
subtle
mixture
of
finesse
firmness
and
diplomacy
not
feeling
himself
powerful
enough
as
yet
bonaparte
the
consul
made
a
rule
according
to
his
own
expression
of
governing
men
as
the
greater
number
wish
to
be
governed
as
emperor
he
often
managed
to
govern
them
according
to
his
own
ideal
we
have
travelled
a
long
way
since
the
time
when
historians
in
their
singular
blindness
and
great
poets
who
possessed
more
talent
than
psychology
would
hold
forth
in
indignant
accents
against
the
coup
of
brumaire
what
profound
illusions
underlay
the
assertion
that
france
lay
fair
in
messidor
great
sun
and
other
illusions
no
less
profound
underlay
such
verdicts
as
that
of
victor
hugo
concerning
this
period
we
have
seen
that
the
crime
of
brumaire
had
as
an
enthusiastic
accomplice
not
only
the
government
itself
but
the
whole
of
france
which
it
delivered
from
anarchy
one
may
wonder
how
intelligent
men
could
so
misjudge
a
period
of
history
which
is
nevertheless
so
clear
it
was
doubtless
because
they
saw
events
through
their
own
convictions
and
we
know
what
transformations
the
truth
may
suffer
for
the
man
who
is
imprisoned
in
the
valleys
of
belief
the
most
luminous
facts
are
obscured
and
the
history
of
events
is
the
history
of
his
dreams
the
psychologist
who
desires
to
understand
the
period
which
we
have
so
briefly
sketched
can
only
do
so
if
being
attached
to
no
party
he
stands
clear
of
the
passions
which
are
the
soul
of
parties
he
will
never
dream
of
recriminating
a
past
which
was
dictated
by
such
imperious
necessities
certainly
napoleon
has
cost
france
dear
his
epic
was
terminated
by
two
invasions
and
there
was
yet
to
be
a
third
whose
consequences
are
felt
even
when
the
prestige
which
he
exerted
even
from
the
tomb
set
upon
the
throne
the
inheritor
of
his
name
all
these
events
are
narrowly
connected
in
their
origin
they
represent
the
price
of
that
capital
phenomenon
in
the
evolution
of
a
people
a
change
of
ideal
man
can
never
make
the
attempt
to
break
suddenly
with
his
ancestors
without
profoundly
affecting
the
course
of
his
own
history
chapter
iii
political
consequences
of
the
conflict
between
traditions
and
revolutionary
principles
during
the
last
century
the
psychological
causes
of
the
continued
revolutionary
movements
to
which
france
has
been
subject
in
examining
in
a
subsequent
chapter
the
evolution
of
revolutionary
ideas
during
the
last
century
we
shall
see
that
during
more
than
fifty
years
they
very
slowly
spread
through
the
various
strata
of
society
during
the
whole
of
this
period
the
great
majority
of
the
people
and
the
bourgeoisie
rejected
them
and
their
diffusion
was
effected
only
by
a
very
limited
number
of
apostles
but
their
influence
thanks
principally
to
the
faults
of
governments
was
sufficient
to
provoke
several
revolutions
we
shall
examine
these
briefly
when
we
have
examined
the
psychological
influences
which
gave
them
birth
the
history
of
our
political
upheavals
during
the
last
century
is
enough
to
prove
even
if
we
did
not
yet
realise
the
fact
that
men
are
governed
by
their
mentalities
far
more
than
by
the
institutions
which
their
rulers
endeavour
to
force
upon
them
the
successive
revolutions
which
france
has
suffered
have
been
the
consequences
of
struggles
between
two
portions
of
the
nation
whose
mentalities
are
different
one
is
religious
and
monarchical
and
is
dominated
by
long
ancestral
influences
the
other
is
subjected
to
the
same
influences
but
gives
them
a
revolutionary
form
from
the
commencement
of
the
revolution
the
struggle
between
contrary
mentalities
was
plainly
manifested
we
have
seen
that
in
spite
of
the
most
frightful
repression
insurrections
and
conspiracies
lasted
until
the
end
of
the
directory
they
proved
that
the
traditions
of
the
past
had
left
profound
roots
in
the
popular
soul
at
a
certain
moment
sixty
departments
were
in
revolt
against
the
new
government
and
were
only
repressed
by
repeated
massacres
on
a
vast
scale
to
establish
some
sort
of
compromise
between
the
ancien
regime
and
the
new
ideals
was
the
most
difficult
of
the
problems
which
bonaparte
had
to
resolve
he
had
to
discover
institutions
which
would
suit
the
two
mentalities
into
which
france
was
divided
he
succeeded
as
we
have
seen
by
conciliatory
measures
and
also
by
dressing
very
ancient
things
in
new
names
his
reign
was
one
of
those
rare
periods
of
french
history
during
which
the
mental
unity
of
france
was
complete
this
unity
could
not
outlive
him
on
the
morrow
of
his
fall
all
the
old
parties
reappeared
and
have
survived
until
the
present
day
some
attach
themselves
to
traditional
influences
others
violently
reject
them
if
this
long
conflict
had
been
between
believers
and
the
indifferent
it
could
not
have
lasted
for
indifference
is
always
tolerant
but
the
struggle
was
really
between
two
different
beliefs
the
lay
church
very
soon
assumed
a
religious
aspect
and
its
pretended
rationalism
has
become
especially
in
recent
years
a
barely
attenuated
form
of
the
narrowest
clerical
spirit
now
we
have
shown
that
no
conciliation
is
possible
between
dissimilar
religious
beliefs
the
clericals
when
in
power
could
not
therefore
show
themselves
more
tolerant
towards
freethinkers
than
these
latter
are
toward
the
clericals
these
divisions
determined
by
differences
of
belief
were
complicated
by
the
addition
of
the
political
conceptions
derived
from
those
beliefs
many
simple
souls
have
for
long
believed
that
the
real
history
of
france
began
with
the
year
of
the
republic
this
rudimentary
conception
is
at
last
dying
out
even
the
most
rigid
revolutionaries
renounce
it
and
are
quite
willing
to
recognise
that
the
past
was
something
better
than
an
epoch
of
black
barbarism
dominated
by
low
superstitions
we
may
judge
of
the
recent
evolution
of
ideas
upon
this
point
by
the
following
passage
from
a
speech
by
jaures
delivered
in
the
chamber
of
deputies
the
greatness
of
is
built
of
the
efforts
of
past
centuries
france
is
not
contained
in
a
day
nor
in
an
epoch
but
in
the
succession
of
all
days
all
periods
all
her
twilights
and
all
her
dawns
the
religious
origin
of
most
of
the
political
beliefs
held
in
france
inspires
their
adepts
with
an
inextinguishable
hatred
which
always
strikes
foreigners
with
amazement
nothing
is
more
obvious
nothing
is
more
certain
writes
in
his
book
on
france
than
this
fact
that
not
only
have
the
royalists
revolutionaries
and
bonapartists
always
been
mortally
opposed
to
one
another
but
that
owing
to
the
passionate
ardour
of
the
french
character
they
have
always
entertained
a
profound
intellectual
horror
for
one
another
men
who
believe
themselves
in
possession
of
the
truth
can
not
refrain
from
affirming
that
those
who
do
not
think
with
them
are
instruments
of
error
each
party
will
gravely
inform
you
that
the
advocates
of
the
adverse
cause
are
afflicted
by
a
dense
stupidity
or
are
consciously
dishonest
yet
when
you
meet
these
latter
who
will
say
exactly
the
same
things
as
their
detractors
you
can
not
but
recognise
in
all
good
faith
that
they
are
neither
stupid
nor
dishonest
this
reciprocal
execration
of
the
believers
of
each
party
has
always
facilitated
the
overthrow
of
governments
and
ministers
in
france
the
parties
in
the
minority
will
never
refuse
to
ally
themselves
against
the
triumphant
party
we
know
that
a
great
number
of
revolutionary
socialists
have
been
elected
to
the
present
chamber
only
by
the
aid
of
the
monarchists
who
are
still
as
unintelligent
as
they
were
at
the
time
of
the
revolution
our
religious
and
political
differences
do
not
constitute
the
only
cause
of
dissension
in
france
they
are
held
by
men
possessing
that
particular
mentality
which
i
have
already
described
under
the
name
of
the
revolutionary
mentality
we
have
seen
that
each
period
always
presents
a
certain
number
of
individuals
ready
to
revolt
against
the
established
order
of
things
whatever
that
may
be
even
though
it
may
realise
all
their
desires
the
intolerance
of
the
parties
in
france
and
their
desire
to
seize
upon
power
are
further
favoured
by
the
conviction
so
prevalent
under
the
revolution
that
societies
can
be
remade
by
means
of
laws
the
modern
state
whatever
its
leader
has
inherited
in
the
eyes
of
the
multitudes
and
their
leaders
the
mystic
power
attributed
to
the
ancient
kings
when
these
latter
were
regarded
as
an
incarnation
of
the
divine
will
not
only
the
people
is
inspired
by
this
confidence
in
the
power
of
government
all
our
legislators
entertain
it
also
after
the
publication
of
an
article
of
mine
concerning
legislative
illusions
i
received
from
one
of
our
most
eminent
politicians
boudenot
the
senator
a
letter
from
which
i
extract
the
following
passage
twenty
years
passed
in
the
chamber
and
the
senate
have
shown
me
how
right
you
are
how
many
times
i
have
heard
my
colleagues
say
government
ought
to
prevent
this
order
that
what
would
you
have
there
are
fourteen
centuries
of
monarchical
atavism
in
our
blood
legislating
always
politicians
never
realise
that
as
institutions
are
effects
and
not
causes
they
have
no
virtue
in
themselves
heirs
to
the
great
revolutionary
illusion
they
do
not
see
that
man
is
created
by
a
past
whose
foundations
we
are
powerless
to
reshape
the
conflict
between
the
principles
dividing
france
which
has
lasted
more
than
a
century
will
doubtless
continue
for
a
long
time
yet
and
no
one
can
foresee
what
fresh
upheavals
it
may
engender
no
doubt
if
before
our
era
the
athenians
could
have
divined
that
their
social
dissensions
would
have
led
to
the
enslavement
of
greece
they
would
have
renounced
them
but
how
could
they
have
foreseen
as
much
guiraud
justly
writes
a
generation
of
men
very
rarely
realises
the
task
which
it
is
accomplishing
it
is
preparing
for
the
future
but
this
future
is
often
the
contrary
of
what
it
wishes
summary
of
a
century
revolutionary
movement
in
france
the
psychological
causes
of
the
revolutionary
movements
which
france
has
seen
during
the
past
century
having
been
explained
it
will
now
suffice
to
present
a
summary
picture
of
these
successive
revolutions
the
sovereigns
in
coalition
having
defeated
napoleon
they
reduced
france
to
her
former
limits
and
placed
louis
the
only
possible
sovereign
on
the
throne
by
a
special
charter
the
new
king
accepted
the
position
of
a
constitutional
monarch
under
a
representative
system
of
government
he
recognised
all
the
conquests
of
the
revolution
the
civil
code
equality
before
the
law
liberty
of
worship
irrevocability
of
the
sale
of
national
property
the
right
of
suffrage
however
was
limited
to
those
paying
a
certain
amount
in
taxes
this
liberal
constitution
was
opposed
by
the
returned
emigres
they
wanted
the
restitution
of
the
national
property
and
the
of
their
ancient
privileges
fearing
that
such
a
reaction
might
cause
a
new
revolution
louis
xviii
was
reduced
to
dissolving
the
chamber
the
election
having
returned
moderate
deputies
he
was
able
to
continue
to
govern
with
the
same
principles
understanding
very
well
that
any
attempt
to
govern
the
french
by
the
ancien
regime
would
be
enough
to
provoke
a
general
rebellion
unfortunately
his
death
in
placed
charles
formerly
comte
on
the
throne
extremely
narrow
incapable
of
understanding
the
new
world
which
surrounded
him
and
boasting
that
he
had
not
modified
his
ideas
since
he
prepared
a
series
of
reactionary
laws
a
law
by
which
an
indemnity
of
forty
millions
sterling
was
to
be
paid
to
emigres
a
law
of
sacrilege
and
laws
establishing
the
rights
of
primogeniture
the
preponderance
of
the
clergy
the
majority
of
the
deputies
showing
themselves
daily
more
opposed
to
his
projects
in
he
enacted
ordinances
dissolving
the
chamber
suppressing
the
liberty
of
the
press
and
preparing
for
the
restoration
of
the
ancien
regime
the
effect
was
immediate
this
autocratic
action
provoked
a
coalition
of
the
leaders
of
all
parties
republicans
bonapartists
liberals
royalists
all
united
in
order
to
raise
the
parisian
populace
four
days
after
the
publication
of
the
ordinances
the
insurgents
were
masters
of
the
capital
and
charles
fled
to
england
the
leaders
of
the
movement
thiers
la
fayette
summoned
to
paris
of
whose
existence
the
people
were
scarcely
aware
and
declared
him
king
of
the
french
between
the
indifference
of
the
people
and
the
hostility
of
the
nobles
who
had
remained
faithful
to
the
legitimate
dynasty
the
new
king
relied
chiefly
upon
the
bourgeoisie
an
electoral
law
having
reduced
the
electors
to
less
than
this
class
played
an
exclusive
part
in
the
government
the
situation
of
the
sovereign
was
not
easy
he
had
to
struggle
simultaneously
against
the
legitimist
supporters
of
henry
the
grandson
of
charles
and
the
bonapartists
who
recognised
as
their
head
the
emperor
nephew
and
finally
against
the
republicans
by
means
of
their
secret
societies
analogous
to
the
clubs
of
the
revolution
the
latter
provoked
numerous
riots
at
various
intervals
between
and
but
these
were
easily
repressed
the
clericals
and
legitimists
on
their
side
did
not
cease
their
intrigues
the
duchess
de
berry
the
mother
of
henry
tried
in
vain
to
raise
the
vendee
as
to
the
clergy
their
demands
finally
made
them
so
intolerable
that
an
insurrection
broke
out
in
the
course
of
which
the
palace
of
the
archbishop
of
paris
was
sacked
the
republicans
as
a
party
were
not
very
dangerous
as
the
chamber
sided
with
the
king
in
the
struggle
against
them
the
minister
guizot
who
advocated
a
strong
central
power
declared
that
two
things
were
indispensable
to
government
reason
and
cannon
the
famous
statesman
was
surely
somewhat
deluded
as
to
the
necessity
or
efficacy
of
reason
despite
this
strong
central
power
which
in
reality
was
not
strong
the
republicans
and
above
all
the
socialists
continued
to
agitate
one
of
the
most
influential
louis
blanc
claimed
that
it
was
the
duty
of
the
government
to
procure
work
for
every
citizen
the
catholic
party
led
by
lacordaire
and
montalembert
united
with
the
socialists
as
in
belgium
to
oppose
the
government
a
campaign
in
favour
of
electoral
reform
ended
in
in
a
fresh
riot
which
unexpectedly
overthrew
his
fall
was
far
less
justifiable
than
that
of
charles
x
there
was
little
with
which
he
could
be
reproached
doubtless
he
was
suspicious
of
universal
suffrage
but
the
french
revolution
had
more
than
once
been
quite
suspicious
of
it
not
being
like
the
directory
an
absolute
ruler
could
not
as
the
latter
had
done
annul
unfavourable
elections
a
provisional
government
was
installed
in
the
hotel
de
ville
to
replace
the
fallen
monarchy
it
proclaimed
the
republic
established
universal
suffrage
and
decreed
that
the
people
should
proceed
to
the
election
of
a
national
assembly
of
nine
hundred
members
from
the
first
days
of
its
existence
the
new
government
found
itself
the
victim
of
socialistic
manoeuvres
and
riots
the
psychological
phenomena
observed
during
the
first
revolution
were
now
to
be
witnessed
again
clubs
were
formed
whose
leaders
sent
the
people
from
time
to
time
against
the
assembly
for
reasons
which
were
generally
quite
devoid
of
common
sense
for
example
to
force
the
government
to
support
an
insurrection
in
poland
in
the
hope
of
satisfying
the
socialists
every
day
more
noisy
and
exigent
the
assembly
organised
national
workshops
in
which
the
workers
were
occupied
in
various
forms
of
labour
in
these
men
cost
the
state
more
than
weekly
their
claim
to
receive
pay
without
working
for
it
forced
the
assembly
to
close
the
workshops
this
measure
was
the
origin
of
a
formidable
insurrection
workers
revolting
the
assembly
terrified
confided
all
the
executive
powers
to
general
cavaignac
there
was
a
battle
with
the
insurgents
during
which
three
generals
and
the
archbishop
of
paris
were
killed
prisoners
were
deported
by
the
assembly
to
algeria
and
revolutionary
socialism
was
annihilated
for
a
space
of
fifty
years
these
events
brought
government
stock
down
from
to
francs
business
was
at
a
standstill
the
peasants
who
thought
themselves
threatened
by
the
socialists
and
the
bourgeois
whose
taxes
the
assembly
had
increased
by
half
turned
against
the
republic
and
when
promised
to
order
he
found
himself
welcomed
with
enthusiasm
a
candidate
for
the
position
of
president
of
the
republic
who
according
to
the
new
constitution
must
be
elected
by
the
whole
body
of
citizens
he
was
chosen
by
votes
very
soon
at
odds
with
the
chamber
the
prince
decided
on
a
coup
the
assembly
was
dissolved
persons
were
arrested
deported
and
a
hundred
deputies
were
exiled
this
coup
although
summary
was
very
favourably
received
for
when
submitted
to
a
plebiscite
it
received
votes
out
of
on
the
of
november
napoleon
had
himself
named
emperor
by
an
even
greater
majority
the
horror
which
the
generality
of
frenchmen
felt
for
demagogues
and
socialists
had
restored
the
empire
in
the
first
part
of
its
existence
it
constituted
an
absolute
government
and
during
the
latter
half
a
liberal
government
after
eighteen
years
of
rule
the
emperor
was
overthrown
by
the
revolution
of
the
of
september
after
the
capitulation
of
sedan
since
that
time
revolutionary
movements
have
been
rare
the
only
one
of
importance
was
the
revolution
of
march
which
resulted
in
the
burning
of
many
of
the
monuments
of
paris
and
the
execution
of
about
insurgents
after
the
war
of
the
electors
who
amid
so
many
disasters
did
not
know
which
way
to
turn
sent
a
great
number
of
orleanist
and
legitimist
deputies
to
the
constituent
assembly
unable
to
agree
upon
the
establishment
of
a
monarchy
they
appointed
thiers
president
of
the
republic
later
replacing
him
by
marshal
macmahon
in
the
new
elections
like
all
those
that
have
followed
sent
a
majority
of
republicans
to
the
chamber
the
various
assemblies
which
have
succeeded
to
this
have
always
been
divided
into
numerous
parties
which
have
provoked
innumerable
changes
of
ministry
however
thanks
to
the
equilibrium
resulting
from
this
division
of
parties
we
have
for
forty
years
enjoyed
comparative
quiet
four
presidents
of
the
republic
have
been
overthrown
without
revolution
and
the
riots
that
have
occurred
such
as
those
of
champagne
and
the
midi
have
not
had
serious
consequences
a
great
popular
movement
in
did
nearly
overthrow
the
republic
for
the
benefit
of
general
boulanger
but
it
has
survived
and
triumphed
over
the
attacks
of
all
parties
various
reasons
contribute
to
the
maintenance
of
the
present
republic
in
the
first
place
of
the
conflicting
factions
none
is
strong
enough
to
crush
the
rest
in
the
second
place
the
head
of
the
state
being
purely
decorative
and
possessing
no
power
it
is
impossible
to
attribute
to
him
the
evils
from
which
the
country
may
suffer
and
to
feel
sure
that
matters
would
be
different
were
he
overthrown
finally
as
the
supreme
power
is
distributed
among
thousands
of
hands
responsibilities
are
so
disseminated
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
know
where
to
begin
a
tyrant
can
be
overthrown
but
what
can
be
done
against
a
host
of
little
anonymous
tyrannies
if
we
wished
to
sum
up
in
a
word
the
great
transformations
which
have
been
effected
in
france
by
a
century
of
riots
and
revolutions
we
might
say
that
individual
tyranny
which
was
weak
and
therefore
easily
overthrown
has
been
replaced
by
collective
tyrannies
which
are
very
strong
and
difficult
to
destroy
to
a
people
avid
of
equality
and
habituated
to
hold
its
governments
responsible
for
every
event
individual
tyranny
seemed
insupportable
while
a
collective
tyranny
is
readily
endured
although
generally
much
more
severe
the
extension
of
the
tyranny
of
the
state
has
therefore
been
the
final
result
of
all
our
revolutions
and
the
common
characteristic
of
all
systems
of
government
which
we
have
known
in
france
this
form
of
tyranny
may
be
regarded
as
a
racial
ideal
since
successive
upheavals
of
france
have
only
fortified
it
statism
is
the
real
political
system
of
the
latin
peoples
and
the
only
system
that
receives
all
suffrages
the
other
forms
of
government
republic
monarchy
empire
represent
empty
labels
powerless
shadows
part
iii
the
recent
evolution
of
the
revolutionary
principles
chapter
i
the
progress
of
democratic
beliefs
since
the
revolution
gradual
propagation
of
democratic
ideas
after
the
revolution
ideas
which
are
firmly
established
incrusted
as
it
were
in
men
minds
continue
to
act
for
several
generations
those
which
resulted
from
the
french
revolution
were
like
others
subject
to
this
law
although
the
life
of
the
revolution
as
a
government
was
short
the
influence
of
its
principles
was
on
the
contrary
very
lived
becoming
a
form
of
religious
belief
they
profoundly
modified
the
orientation
of
the
sentiments
and
ideas
of
several
generations
despite
a
few
intervals
the
french
revolution
has
continued
up
to
the
present
and
still
survives
the
role
of
napoleon
was
not
confined
to
overturning
the
world
changing
the
map
of
europe
and
remaking
the
exploits
of
alexander
the
new
rights
of
the
people
created
by
the
revolution
and
established
by
its
institutions
have
exercised
a
profound
influence
the
military
work
of
the
conqueror
was
soon
dissolved
but
the
revolutionary
principles
which
he
contributed
to
propagate
have
survived
him
the
various
restorations
which
followed
the
empire
caused
men
at
first
to
become
somewhat
forgetful
of
the
principles
of
the
revolution
for
fifty
years
this
propagation
was
far
from
rapid
one
might
almost
have
supposed
that
the
people
had
forgotten
them
only
a
small
number
of
theorists
maintained
their
influence
heirs
to
the
simplicist
spirit
of
the
jacobins
believing
like
them
that
societies
can
be
remade
from
top
to
bottom
by
the
laws
and
persuaded
that
the
empire
had
only
interrupted
the
task
of
revolution
they
wished
to
resume
it
while
waiting
until
they
could
recommence
they
attempted
to
spread
the
principles
of
the
revolution
by
means
of
their
writings
faithful
imitators
of
the
men
of
the
revolution
they
never
stopped
to
ask
if
their
schemes
for
reform
were
in
conformity
with
human
nature
they
too
were
erecting
a
chimerical
society
for
an
ideal
man
and
were
persuaded
that
the
application
of
their
dreams
would
regenerate
the
human
species
deprived
of
all
constructive
power
the
theorists
of
all
the
ages
have
always
been
very
ready
to
destroy
napoleon
at
helena
stated
that
if
there
existed
a
monarchy
of
granite
the
idealists
and
theorists
would
manage
to
reduce
it
to
powder
among
the
galaxy
of
dreamers
such
as
fourier
pierre
leroux
louis
blanc
quinet
we
find
that
only
auguste
comte
understood
that
a
transformation
of
manners
and
ideas
must
precede
political
reorganisation
far
from
favouring
the
diffusion
of
democratic
ideas
the
projects
of
reform
of
the
theorists
of
this
period
merely
impeded
their
progress
communistic
socialism
which
several
of
them
professed
would
restore
the
revolution
finally
alarmed
the
bourgeoisie
and
even
the
we
have
already
seen
that
the
fear
of
their
ideas
was
one
of
the
principal
causes
of
the
restoration
of
the
empire
if
none
of
the
chimerical
lucubrations
of
the
writers
of
the
first
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
deserve
to
be
discussed
it
is
none
the
less
interesting
to
examine
them
in
order
to
observe
the
part
played
by
religious
and
moral
ideas
which
are
regarded
with
contempt
persuaded
that
a
new
society
could
not
any
more
than
the
societies
of
old
be
built
up
without
religious
and
moral
beliefs
the
reformers
were
always
endeavouring
to
found
such
beliefs
but
on
what
could
they
be
based
evidently
on
reason
by
means
of
reason
men
create
complicated
machines
why
not
therefore
a
religion
and
a
morality
things
which
are
apparently
so
simple
not
one
of
them
suspected
the
fact
that
no
religious
or
moral
belief
ever
had
rational
logic
as
its
basis
auguste
comte
saw
no
more
clearly
we
know
that
he
founded
a
positivist
religion
which
still
has
a
few
followers
scientists
were
to
form
a
clergy
directed
by
a
new
pope
who
was
to
replace
the
catholic
pope
all
these
conceptions
political
religious
or
moral
had
i
repeat
no
other
results
for
a
long
time
than
to
turn
the
multitude
away
from
democratic
principles
if
these
principles
did
finally
become
widespread
it
was
not
on
account
of
the
theorists
but
because
new
conditions
of
life
had
arisen
thanks
to
the
discoveries
of
science
industry
developed
and
led
to
the
erection
of
immense
factories
economic
necessities
increasingly
dominated
the
wills
of
governments
and
the
people
and
finally
created
a
favourable
soil
for
the
extension
of
socialism
and
above
all
of
syndicalism
the
modern
forms
of
democratic
ideas
the
unequal
influence
of
the
three
fundamental
principles
of
the
revolution
the
heritage
of
the
revolution
is
summed
up
in
its
entirety
in
the
one
phrase
liberty
equality
and
fraternity
the
principle
of
equality
as
we
have
seen
has
exerted
a
powerful
influence
but
the
two
others
did
not
share
its
lot
although
the
sense
of
these
terms
seems
clear
enough
they
were
comprehended
in
very
different
fashions
according
to
men
and
times
we
know
that
the
various
interpretation
of
the
same
words
by
persons
of
different
mentality
has
been
one
of
the
most
frequent
causes
of
the
conflicts
of
history
to
the
member
of
the
convention
liberty
signified
merely
the
exercise
of
its
unlimited
despotism
to
a
young
modern
intellectual
the
same
word
means
a
general
release
from
everything
irksome
tradition
law
superiority
to
the
modern
jacobin
liberty
consists
especially
in
the
right
to
persecute
his
adversaries
although
political
orators
still
occasionally
mention
liberty
in
their
speeches
they
have
generally
ceased
to
evoke
fraternity
it
is
the
conflict
of
the
different
classes
and
not
their
alliance
that
they
teach
never
did
a
more
profound
hatred
divide
the
various
strata
of
society
and
the
political
parties
which
lead
them
but
while
liberty
has
become
very
doubtful
and
fraternity
has
completely
vanished
the
principle
of
equality
has
grown
unchecked
it
has
been
supreme
in
all
the
political
upheavals
of
which
france
has
been
the
stage
during
the
last
century
and
has
reached
such
a
development
that
our
political
and
social
life
our
laws
manners
and
customs
are
at
least
in
theory
based
on
this
principle
it
constitutes
the
real
legacy
of
the
revolution
the
craving
for
equality
not
only
before
the
law
but
in
position
and
fortune
is
the
very
pivot
of
the
last
product
of
democracy
socialism
this
craving
is
so
powerful
that
it
is
spreading
in
all
directions
although
in
contradiction
with
all
biological
and
economic
laws
it
is
a
new
phase
of
the
interrupted
struggle
of
the
sentiments
against
reason
in
which
reason
so
rarely
triumphs
the
democracy
of
the
intellectuals
and
popular
democracy
all
ideas
that
have
hitherto
caused
an
upheaval
of
the
world
of
men
have
been
subject
to
two
laws
they
evolve
slowly
and
they
completely
change
their
sense
according
to
the
mentalities
in
which
they
find
reception
a
doctrine
may
be
compared
to
a
living
being
it
subsists
only
by
process
of
transformation
the
books
are
necessarily
silent
upon
these
variations
so
that
the
phase
of
things
which
they
establish
belongs
only
to
the
past
they
do
not
reflect
the
image
of
the
living
but
of
the
dead
the
written
statement
of
a
doctrine
often
represents
the
most
negligible
side
of
that
doctrine
i
have
shown
in
another
work
how
institutions
arts
and
languages
are
modified
in
passing
from
one
people
to
another
and
how
the
laws
of
these
transformations
differ
from
the
truth
as
stated
in
books
i
allude
to
this
matter
now
merely
to
show
why
in
examining
the
subject
of
democratic
ideas
we
occupy
ourselves
so
little
with
the
text
of
doctrines
and
seek
only
for
the
psychological
elements
of
which
they
constitute
the
vestment
and
the
reactions
which
they
provoke
in
the
various
categories
of
men
who
have
accepted
them
modified
rapidly
by
men
of
different
mentalities
the
original
theory
is
soon
no
more
than
a
label
which
denotes
something
quite
unlike
itself
applicable
to
religious
beliefs
these
principles
are
equally
so
to
political
beliefs
when
a
man
speaks
of
democracy
for
example
must
we
inquire
what
this
word
means
to
various
peoples
and
also
whether
in
the
same
people
there
is
not
a
great
difference
between
the
democracy
of
the
intellectuals
and
popular
democracy
in
confining
ourselves
now
to
the
consideration
of
this
latter
point
we
shall
readily
perceive
that
the
democratic
ideas
to
be
found
in
books
and
journals
are
purely
the
theories
of
literary
people
of
which
the
people
know
nothing
and
by
the
application
of
which
they
would
have
nothing
to
gain
although
the
man
possesses
the
theoretical
right
of
passing
the
barriers
which
separate
him
from
the
upper
classes
by
a
whole
series
of
competitions
and
examinations
his
chance
of
reaching
them
is
in
reality
extremely
slight
the
democracy
of
the
lettered
classes
has
no
other
object
than
to
set
up
a
selection
which
shall
recruit
the
directing
classes
exclusively
from
themselves
i
should
have
nothing
to
say
against
this
if
the
selection
were
real
it
would
then
constitute
the
application
of
the
maxim
of
napoleon
the
true
method
of
government
is
to
employ
the
aristocracy
but
under
the
forms
of
democracy
unhappily
the
democracy
of
the
intellectuals
would
simply
lead
to
the
substitution
of
the
divine
right
of
kings
by
the
divine
right
of
a
petty
oligarchy
which
is
too
often
narrow
and
tyrannical
liberty
can
not
be
created
by
replacing
a
tyranny
popular
democracy
by
no
means
aims
at
manufacturing
rulers
dominated
entirely
by
the
spirit
of
equality
and
the
desire
to
ameliorate
the
lot
of
the
workers
it
rejects
the
idea
of
fraternity
and
exhibits
no
anxiety
in
respect
of
liberty
no
government
is
conceivable
to
popular
democracy
except
in
the
form
of
an
autocracy
we
see
this
not
only
in
history
which
shows
us
that
since
the
revolution
all
despotic
governments
have
been
vigorously
acclaimed
but
also
in
the
autocratic
fashion
in
which
the
workers
trades
unions
are
conducted
this
profound
distinction
between
the
democracy
of
the
lettered
classes
and
popular
democracy
is
far
more
obvious
to
the
workers
than
to
the
intellectuals
in
their
mentalities
there
is
nothing
in
common
the
two
classes
do
not
speak
the
same
language
the
syndicalists
emphatically
assert
that
no
alliance
could
possibly
exist
between
them
and
the
politicians
of
the
bourgeoisie
this
assertion
is
strictly
true
it
was
always
so
and
this
no
doubt
is
why
popular
democracy
from
plato
to
our
own
times
has
never
been
defended
by
the
great
thinkers
this
fact
has
greatly
struck
emile
faguet
almost
all
the
thinkers
of
the
nineteenth
century
he
says
were
not
democrats
when
i
was
writing
my
politiques
et
moralistes
du
xixe
siecle
this
was
my
despair
i
could
not
find
one
who
had
been
a
democrat
yet
i
was
extremely
anxious
to
find
one
so
that
i
could
give
the
democratic
doctrine
as
formulated
by
him
the
eminent
writer
might
certainly
have
found
plenty
of
professional
politicians
but
these
latter
rarely
belong
to
the
category
of
thinkers
natural
inequalities
and
democratic
equalisation
the
difficulty
of
reconciling
democratic
equalisation
with
natural
inequalities
constitutes
one
of
the
most
difficult
problems
of
the
present
hour
we
know
what
are
the
desires
of
democracy
let
us
see
what
nature
replies
to
these
demands
the
democratic
ideas
which
have
so
often
shaken
the
world
from
the
heroic
ages
of
greece
to
modern
times
are
always
clashing
with
natural
inequalities
some
observers
have
held
with
helvetius
that
the
inequality
between
men
is
created
by
education
as
a
matter
of
fact
nature
does
not
know
such
a
thing
as
equality
she
distributes
unevenly
genius
beauty
health
vigour
intelligence
and
all
the
qualities
which
confer
on
their
possessors
a
superiority
over
their
fellows
no
theory
can
alter
these
discrepancies
so
that
democratic
doctrines
will
remain
confined
to
words
until
the
laws
of
heredity
consent
to
unify
the
capacities
of
men
can
we
suppose
that
societies
will
ever
succeed
in
establishing
artificially
the
equality
refused
by
nature
a
few
theorists
have
believed
for
a
long
time
that
education
might
effect
a
general
levelling
many
years
of
experience
have
shown
the
depth
of
this
illusion
it
would
not
however
be
impossible
for
a
triumphant
socialism
to
establish
equality
for
a
time
by
rigorously
eliminating
all
superior
individuals
one
can
easily
foresee
what
would
become
of
a
people
that
had
suppressed
its
best
individuals
while
surrounded
by
other
nations
progressing
by
means
of
their
best
individuals
not
only
does
nature
not
know
equality
but
since
the
beginning
of
the
ages
she
has
always
realised
progress
by
means
of
successive
differentiations
that
is
to
say
by
increasing
inequalities
these
alone
could
raise
the
obscure
cell
of
the
early
geological
periods
to
the
superior
beings
whose
inventions
were
to
change
the
face
of
the
earth
the
same
phenomenon
is
to
be
observed
in
societies
the
forms
of
democracy
which
select
the
better
elements
of
the
popular
classes
finally
result
in
the
creation
of
an
intellectual
aristocracy
a
result
the
contrary
of
the
dream
of
the
pure
theorists
to
beat
down
the
superior
elements
of
society
to
the
level
of
the
inferior
elements
on
the
side
of
natural
law
which
is
hostile
to
theories
of
equality
are
the
conditions
of
modern
progress
science
and
industry
demand
more
and
more
considerable
intellectual
efforts
so
that
mental
inequalities
and
the
differences
of
social
condition
which
spring
from
them
can
not
but
become
accentuated
we
therefore
observe
this
striking
phenomenon
as
laws
and
institutions
seek
to
level
individuals
the
progress
of
civilisation
tends
still
further
to
differentiate
them
from
the
peasant
to
the
feudal
baron
the
intellectual
difference
was
not
great
but
from
the
to
the
engineer
it
is
immense
and
is
increasing
daily
capacity
being
the
principal
factor
of
progress
the
capable
of
each
class
rise
while
the
mediocre
remain
stationary
or
sink
what
could
laws
do
in
the
face
of
such
inevitable
necessities
in
vain
do
the
incapable
pretend
that
representing
number
they
also
represent
force
deprived
of
the
superior
brains
by
whose
researches
all
workers
profit
they
would
speedily
sink
into
poverty
and
anarchy
the
capital
role
of
the
elect
in
modern
civilisation
seems
too
obvious
to
need
pointing
out
in
the
case
of
civilised
nations
and
barbarian
peoples
which
contain
similar
averages
of
mediocrities
the
superiority
of
the
former
arises
solely
from
the
superior
minds
which
they
contain
the
united
states
have
understood
this
so
thoroughly
that
they
forbid
the
immigration
of
chinese
workers
whose
capacity
is
identical
with
that
of
american
workers
and
who
working
for
lower
wages
tend
to
create
a
formidable
competition
with
the
latter
despite
these
evidences
we
see
the
antagonism
between
the
multitude
and
the
elect
increasing
day
by
day
at
no
period
were
the
elect
more
necessary
yet
never
were
they
supported
with
such
difficulty
one
of
the
most
solid
foundations
of
socialism
is
an
intense
hatred
of
the
elect
its
adepts
always
forget
that
scientific
artistic
and
industrial
progress
which
creates
the
strength
of
a
country
and
the
prosperity
of
millions
of
workers
is
due
solely
to
a
small
number
of
superior
brains
if
the
worker
makes
three
times
as
much
as
he
did
a
hundred
years
ago
and
enjoys
commodities
then
unknown
to
great
nobles
he
owes
it
entirely
to
the
elect
suppose
that
by
some
miracle
socialism
had
been
universally
accepted
a
century
ago
risk
speculation
initiative
in
a
word
all
the
stimulants
of
human
activity
being
suppressed
no
progress
would
have
been
possible
and
the
worker
would
have
remained
as
poor
as
he
was
men
would
merely
have
established
that
equality
in
poverty
desired
by
the
jealousy
and
envy
of
a
host
of
mediocre
minds
humanity
will
never
renounce
the
progress
of
civilisation
to
satisfy
so
low
an
ideal
chapter
ii
the
results
of
democratic
evolution
the
influence
upon
social
evolution
of
theories
of
no
rational
value
we
have
seen
that
natural
laws
do
not
agree
with
the
aspirations
of
democracy
we
know
also
that
such
a
statement
has
never
affected
doctrines
already
in
men
minds
the
man
led
by
a
belief
never
troubles
about
its
real
value
the
philosopher
who
studies
a
belief
must
obviously
discuss
its
rational
content
but
he
is
more
concerned
with
its
influences
upon
the
general
mind
applied
to
the
interpretation
of
all
the
great
beliefs
of
history
the
importance
of
this
distinction
is
at
once
evident
jupiter
moloch
vishnu
allah
and
so
many
other
divinities
were
no
doubt
from
the
rational
point
of
view
mere
illusions
yet
their
effect
upon
the
life
of
the
peoples
has
been
considerable
the
same
distinction
is
applicable
to
the
beliefs
which
prevailed
during
the
middle
ages
equally
illusory
they
nevertheless
exercised
as
profound
an
influence
as
if
they
had
corresponded
with
realities
if
any
one
doubts
this
let
him
compare
the
domination
of
the
roman
empire
and
that
of
the
church
of
rome
the
first
was
perfectly
real
and
tangible
and
implied
no
illusion
the
second
while
its
foundations
were
entirely
chimerical
was
fully
as
powerful
thanks
to
it
during
the
long
night
of
the
middle
ages
peoples
acquired
those
social
bonds
and
restraints
and
that
national
soul
without
which
there
is
no
civilisation
the
power
possessed
by
the
church
proves
again
that
the
power
of
certain
illusions
is
sufficiently
great
to
create
at
least
momentarily
sentiments
as
contrary
to
the
interests
of
the
individual
as
they
are
to
that
of
society
such
as
the
love
of
the
monastic
life
the
desire
for
martyrdom
the
crusades
the
religious
wars
the
application
to
democratic
and
socialistic
ideas
of
the
preceding
considerations
shows
that
it
matters
little
that
these
ideas
have
no
defensible
basis
they
impress
and
influence
minds
and
that
is
sufficient
their
results
may
be
disastrous
in
the
extreme
but
we
can
not
prevent
them
the
apostles
of
the
new
doctrines
are
quite
wrong
in
taking
so
much
trouble
to
find
a
rational
basis
for
their
aspirations
they
would
be
far
more
convincing
were
they
to
confine
themselves
to
making
affirmations
and
awakening
hopes
their
real
strength
resides
in
the
religious
mentality
which
is
inherent
in
the
heart
of
man
and
which
during
the
ages
has
only
changed
its
object
later
on
we
shall
consider
from
a
philosophical
point
of
view
various
consequences
of
the
democratic
evolution
whose
course
we
see
accelerating
we
may
say
in
respect
of
the
church
in
the
middle
ages
that
it
had
the
power
of
profoundly
influencing
the
mentality
of
men
examining
certain
results
of
the
democratic
doctrines
we
shall
see
that
the
power
of
these
is
no
less
than
that
of
the
church
the
jacobin
spirit
and
the
mentality
created
by
democratic
beliefs
existing
generations
have
inherited
not
only
the
revolutionary
principles
but
also
the
special
mentality
which
achieves
their
success
describing
this
mentality
when
we
were
examining
the
jacobin
spirit
we
saw
that
it
always
endeavours
to
impose
by
force
illusions
which
it
regards
as
the
truth
the
jacobin
spirit
has
finally
become
so
general
in
france
and
in
other
latin
countries
that
it
has
affected
all
political
parties
even
the
most
conservative
the
bourgeoisie
is
strongly
affected
by
it
and
the
people
still
more
so
this
increase
of
the
jacobin
spirit
has
resulted
in
the
fact
that
political
conceptions
institutions
and
laws
tend
to
impose
themselves
by
force
syndicalism
peaceful
enough
in
other
countries
immediately
assumed
in
france
an
uncompromising
and
anarchical
aspect
which
betrayed
itself
in
the
shape
of
riots
sabotage
and
incendiarism
not
to
be
repressed
by
timid
governments
the
jacobin
spirit
produces
melancholy
ravages
in
minds
of
mediocre
capacity
at
a
recent
congress
of
railway
men
a
third
of
the
delegates
voted
approval
of
sabotage
and
one
of
the
secretaries
of
the
congress
began
his
speech
by
saying
i
send
all
saboteurs
my
fraternal
greeting
and
all
my
admiration
this
general
mentality
engenders
an
increasing
anarchy
that
france
is
not
in
a
permanent
state
of
anarchy
is
as
i
have
already
remarked
due
to
the
fact
that
the
parties
by
which
she
is
divided
produce
something
like
equilibrium
they
are
animated
by
a
mortal
hatred
for
one
another
but
none
of
them
is
strong
enough
to
enslave
its
rivals
this
jacobin
intolerance
is
spreading
to
such
an
extent
that
the
rulers
themselves
employ
without
scruple
the
most
revolutionary
tactics
with
regard
to
their
enemies
violently
persecuting
any
party
that
offers
the
least
resistance
and
even
despoiling
it
of
its
property
our
rulers
behave
as
the
ancient
conquerors
used
the
vanquished
have
nothing
to
hope
from
the
victors
far
from
being
peculiar
to
the
lower
orders
intolerance
is
equally
prominent
among
the
ruling
classes
michelet
remarked
long
ago
that
the
violence
of
the
cultivated
classes
is
often
greater
than
that
of
the
people
it
is
true
that
they
do
not
break
the
street
lamps
but
they
are
ready
enough
to
cause
heads
to
be
broken
the
worst
violence
of
the
revolution
was
the
work
of
cultivated
bourgeoisie
professors
lawyers
possessors
of
that
classical
education
which
is
supposed
to
soften
the
manners
it
has
not
done
so
in
these
days
any
more
than
it
did
of
old
one
can
make
sure
of
this
by
reading
the
advanced
journals
whose
contributors
and
editors
are
recruited
chiefly
from
among
the
professors
of
the
university
their
books
are
as
violent
as
their
articles
and
one
wonders
how
such
favourites
of
fortune
can
have
secreted
such
stores
of
hatred
one
would
find
it
hard
to
credit
them
did
they
assure
us
that
they
were
consumed
by
an
intense
passion
for
altruism
one
might
more
readily
admit
that
apart
from
a
narrow
religious
mentality
the
hope
of
being
remarked
by
the
mighty
ones
of
the
day
or
of
creating
a
profitable
popularity
is
the
only
possible
explanation
of
the
violence
recommended
in
their
written
propaganda
i
have
already
in
one
of
my
preceding
works
cited
some
passages
from
a
book
written
by
a
professor
at
the
college
of
france
in
which
the
author
incites
the
people
to
seize
upon
the
riches
of
the
bourgeoisie
whom
he
furiously
abuses
and
have
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
a
new
revolution
would
readily
find
among
the
authors
of
such
books
the
marats
robespierres
and
carriers
whom
it
might
require
the
jacobin
religion
above
all
in
its
socialist
form
has
all
the
power
of
the
ancient
faiths
over
feeble
minds
blinded
by
their
faith
they
believe
that
reason
is
their
guide
but
are
really
actuated
solely
by
their
passions
and
their
dreams
the
evolution
of
democratic
ideas
has
thus
produced
not
only
the
political
results
already
mentioned
but
also
a
considerable
effect
upon
the
mentality
of
modern
men
if
the
ancient
dogmas
have
long
ago
exhausted
their
power
the
theories
of
democracy
are
far
from
having
lost
theirs
and
we
see
their
consequences
increasing
daily
one
of
the
chief
results
has
been
the
general
hatred
of
superiority
this
hatred
of
whatever
passes
the
average
in
social
fortune
or
intelligence
is
general
in
all
classes
from
the
classes
to
the
upper
strata
of
the
bourgeoisie
the
results
are
envy
detraction
and
a
love
of
attack
of
raillery
of
persecution
and
a
habit
of
attributing
all
actions
to
low
motives
of
refusing
to
believe
in
probity
disinterestedness
and
intelligence
conversation
among
the
people
as
among
the
most
cultivated
frenchmen
is
stamped
with
the
craze
for
abasing
and
abusing
everything
and
everyone
even
the
greatest
of
the
dead
do
not
escape
this
tendency
never
were
so
many
books
written
to
depreciate
the
merit
of
famous
men
men
who
were
formerly
regarded
as
the
most
precious
patrimony
of
their
country
envy
and
hatred
seem
from
all
time
to
have
been
inseparable
from
democratic
theories
but
the
spread
of
these
sentiments
has
never
been
so
great
as
it
strikes
all
observers
there
is
a
low
demagogic
instinct
writes
bourdeau
without
any
moral
inspiration
which
dreams
of
pulling
humanity
down
to
the
lowest
level
and
for
which
any
superiority
even
of
culture
is
an
offence
to
society
it
is
the
sentiment
of
ignoble
equality
which
animated
the
jacobin
butchers
when
they
struck
off
the
head
of
a
lavoisier
or
a
chenier
this
hatred
of
superiority
the
most
prominent
element
in
the
modern
progress
of
socialism
is
not
the
only
characteristic
of
the
new
spirit
created
by
democratic
ideas
other
consequences
although
indirect
are
not
less
profound
such
for
example
are
the
progress
of
statism
the
diminution
of
the
power
of
the
bourgeoisie
the
increasing
activity
of
financiers
the
conflict
of
the
classes
the
vanishing
of
the
old
social
constraints
and
the
degradation
of
morality
all
these
effects
are
displayed
in
a
general
insubordination
and
anarchy
the
son
revolts
against
the
father
the
employee
against
his
patron
the
soldier
against
his
officers
discontent
hatred
and
envy
reign
throughout
a
social
movement
which
continues
is
necessarily
like
a
machine
in
movement
which
accelerates
its
motion
we
shall
therefore
find
that
the
results
of
this
mentality
will
become
yet
more
important
it
is
betrayed
from
time
to
time
by
incidents
whose
gravity
is
daily
increasing
railway
strikes
postmen
strikes
explosions
on
board
ironclads
a
propos
of
the
destruction
of
the
liberte
which
cost
more
than
two
million
pounds
and
slew
two
hundred
men
in
the
space
of
a
minute
an
of
marine
de
lanessan
expresses
himself
as
follows
evil
that
is
gnawing
at
our
fleet
is
the
same
as
that
which
is
devouring
our
army
our
public
administrations
our
parliamentary
system
our
governmental
system
and
the
whole
fabric
of
our
society
this
evil
is
anarchy
that
is
to
say
such
a
disorder
of
minds
and
things
that
nothing
is
done
as
reason
would
dictate
and
no
one
behaves
as
his
professional
or
moral
duty
should
require
him
to
behave
on
the
subject
of
the
catastrophe
of
the
liberte
which
followed
that
of
the
iena
felix
roussel
said
in
a
speech
delivered
as
president
of
the
municipal
council
of
paris
the
causes
of
the
evil
are
not
peculiar
to
our
day
the
evil
is
more
general
and
bears
a
triple
name
irresponsibility
indiscipline
and
anarchy
these
quotations
which
state
facts
with
which
everyone
is
familiar
show
that
the
staunchest
upholders
of
the
republican
system
themselves
recognise
the
progress
of
social
disorganisation
everyone
sees
it
while
he
is
conscious
of
his
own
impotence
to
change
anything
it
results
in
fact
from
mental
influences
whose
power
is
greater
than
that
of
our
wills
this
disorder
is
the
same
in
all
the
government
departments
interesting
examples
will
be
found
in
a
report
of
dausset
to
the
municipal
council
the
service
of
the
public
highways
which
ought
above
all
to
be
noted
for
its
rapid
execution
is
on
the
contrary
the
very
type
of
bureaucratic
and
administration
possessing
men
and
money
and
wasting
both
in
tasks
which
are
often
useless
for
lack
of
order
initiative
and
method
in
a
word
of
organisation
speaking
then
of
the
directors
of
departments
each
of
whom
works
as
he
pleases
and
after
his
own
fashion
he
adds
these
important
persons
completely
ignore
one
another
they
prepare
and
execute
their
plans
without
knowing
anything
of
what
their
neighbours
are
doing
there
is
no
one
above
them
to
group
and
their
work
this
is
why
a
road
is
often
torn
up
repaired
and
then
torn
up
again
a
few
days
later
because
the
departments
dealing
with
the
supply
of
water
gas
electricity
and
the
sewers
are
mutually
jealous
and
never
attempt
to
work
together
this
anarchy
and
indiscipline
naturally
cost
enormous
sums
of
money
and
a
private
firm
which
operated
in
this
manner
would
soon
find
itself
bankrupt
universal
suffrage
and
its
representatives
among
the
dogmas
of
democracy
perhaps
the
most
fundamental
of
all
and
the
most
attractive
is
that
of
universal
suffrage
it
gives
the
masses
the
idea
of
equality
since
for
a
moment
at
least
rich
and
poor
learned
and
ignorant
are
equal
before
the
electoral
urn
the
minister
elbows
the
least
of
his
servants
and
during
this
brief
moment
the
power
of
one
is
as
great
as
the
others
all
governments
including
that
of
the
revolution
have
feared
universal
suffrage
at
a
first
glance
indeed
the
objections
which
suggests
themselves
are
numerous
the
idea
that
the
multitude
could
usefully
choose
the
men
capable
of
governing
that
individuals
of
indifferent
morality
feeble
knowledge
and
narrow
minds
should
possess
by
the
sole
fact
of
number
a
certain
talent
for
judging
the
candidate
proposed
for
its
selection
is
surely
a
shocking
one
from
a
rational
point
of
view
the
suffrage
of
numbers
is
to
a
certain
extent
justified
if
we
think
with
pascal
plurality
is
the
best
way
because
it
is
visible
and
has
strength
to
make
itself
obeyed
it
is
however
the
advice
of
the
less
able
as
universal
suffrage
can
not
in
our
times
be
replaced
by
any
other
institution
we
must
accept
it
and
try
to
adapt
it
it
is
accordingly
useless
to
protest
against
it
or
to
repeat
with
the
queen
marie
caroline
at
the
time
of
her
struggle
with
napoleon
nothing
is
more
dreadful
than
to
govern
men
in
this
enlightened
century
when
every
cobbler
reasons
and
criticises
the
government
to
tell
the
truth
the
objections
are
not
always
as
great
as
they
appear
the
laws
of
the
psychology
of
crowds
being
admitted
it
is
very
doubtful
whether
a
limited
suffrage
would
give
a
much
better
choice
of
men
than
that
obtained
by
universal
suffrage
these
same
psychological
laws
also
show
us
that
universal
suffrage
is
in
reality
a
pure
fiction
the
crowd
save
in
very
rare
cases
has
no
opinion
but
that
of
its
leaders
universal
suffrage
really
represents
the
most
limited
of
suffrages
there
justly
resides
its
real
danger
universal
suffrage
is
made
dangerous
by
the
fact
that
the
leaders
who
are
its
masters
are
the
creatures
of
little
local
committees
analogous
to
the
clubs
of
the
revolution
the
leader
who
canvasses
for
a
mandate
is
chosen
by
them
once
nominated
he
exercises
an
absolute
local
power
on
condition
of
satisfying
the
interests
of
his
committees
before
this
necessity
the
general
interest
of
the
country
disappears
almost
totally
from
the
mind
of
the
elected
representative
naturally
the
committees
having
need
of
docile
servants
do
not
choose
for
this
task
individuals
gifted
with
a
lofty
intelligence
nor
above
all
with
a
very
high
morality
they
must
have
men
without
character
without
social
position
and
always
docile
by
reason
of
these
necessities
the
servility
of
the
deputy
in
respect
of
these
little
groups
which
patronise
him
and
without
which
he
would
be
no
one
is
absolute
he
will
speak
and
vote
just
as
his
committee
tells
him
his
political
ideal
may
be
expressed
in
a
few
words
it
is
to
obey
that
he
may
retain
his
post
sometimes
rarely
indeed
and
only
when
by
name
or
position
or
wealth
he
has
a
great
prestige
a
superior
character
may
impose
himself
upon
the
popular
vote
by
overcoming
the
tyranny
of
the
impudent
minorities
which
constitute
the
local
committees
democratic
countries
like
france
are
only
apparently
governed
by
universal
suffrage
for
this
reason
is
it
that
so
many
measures
are
passed
which
do
not
interest
the
people
and
which
the
people
never
demanded
such
were
the
purchase
of
the
western
railways
the
laws
respecting
congregations
these
absurd
manifestations
merely
translated
the
demands
of
fanatical
local
committees
and
were
imposed
upon
deputies
whom
they
had
chosen
we
may
judge
of
the
influence
of
these
committees
when
we
see
moderate
deputies
forced
to
patronise
the
anarchical
destroyers
of
arsenals
to
ally
themselves
with
and
in
a
word
to
obey
the
most
atrocious
demands
in
order
to
ensure
the
will
of
the
lowest
elements
of
democracy
has
thus
created
among
the
elected
representatives
manners
and
a
morality
which
we
can
but
recognise
are
of
the
lowest
the
politician
is
the
man
in
public
employment
and
as
nietzsche
says
where
public
employment
begins
there
begins
also
the
clamour
of
the
great
comedians
and
the
buzzing
of
venomous
flies
the
comedian
always
believes
in
that
which
makes
him
obtain
his
best
effects
in
that
which
impels
the
people
to
believe
in
him
morrow
he
will
have
a
new
faith
and
the
day
after
yet
another
all
that
is
great
has
its
being
far
from
public
employment
and
glory
the
craving
for
reforms
the
craze
for
reforms
imposed
suddenly
by
means
of
decrees
is
one
of
the
most
disastrous
conceptions
of
the
jacobin
spirit
one
of
the
formidable
legacies
left
by
the
revolution
it
is
among
the
principal
factors
of
all
the
incessant
political
upheavals
of
the
last
century
in
france
one
of
the
psychological
causes
of
this
intense
thirst
for
reforms
arises
from
the
difficulty
of
determining
the
real
causes
of
the
evils
complained
of
the
need
of
explanation
creates
fictitious
causes
of
the
simplest
nature
therefore
the
remedies
also
appear
simple
for
forty
years
we
have
incessantly
been
passing
reforms
each
of
which
is
a
little
revolution
in
itself
in
spite
of
all
these
or
rather
because
of
them
the
french
have
evolved
almost
as
little
as
any
race
in
europe
the
slowness
of
our
actual
evolution
may
be
seen
if
we
compare
the
principal
elements
of
our
social
life
commerce
industry
with
those
of
other
nations
the
progress
of
other
nations
of
the
germans
especially
then
appears
enormous
while
our
own
has
been
very
slow
our
administrative
industrial
and
commercial
organisation
is
considerably
out
of
date
and
is
no
longer
equal
to
our
new
needs
our
industry
is
not
prospering
our
marine
is
declining
even
in
our
own
colonies
we
can
not
compete
with
foreign
countries
despite
the
enormous
pecuniary
subventions
accorded
by
the
state
cruppi
an
of
commerce
has
insisted
on
this
melancholy
decline
in
a
recent
book
falling
into
the
usual
errors
he
believed
it
easy
to
remedy
this
inferiority
by
new
laws
all
politicians
share
the
same
opinion
which
is
why
we
progress
so
slowly
each
party
is
persuaded
that
by
means
of
reforms
all
evils
could
be
remedied
this
conviction
results
in
struggles
such
as
have
made
france
the
most
divided
country
in
the
world
and
the
most
subject
to
anarchy
no
one
yet
seems
to
understand
that
individuals
and
their
methods
not
regulations
make
the
value
of
a
people
the
efficacious
reforms
are
not
the
revolutionary
reforms
but
the
trifling
ameliorations
of
every
day
accumulated
in
course
of
time
the
great
social
changes
like
the
great
geological
changes
are
effected
by
the
daily
addition
of
minute
causes
the
economic
history
of
germany
during
the
last
forty
years
proves
in
a
striking
manner
the
truth
of
this
law
many
important
events
which
seem
to
depend
more
or
less
on
hazard
as
battles
for
example
are
themselves
subject
to
this
law
of
the
accumulation
of
small
causes
no
doubt
the
decisive
struggle
is
sometimes
terminated
in
a
day
or
less
but
many
minute
efforts
slowly
accumulated
are
essential
to
victory
we
had
a
painful
experience
of
this
in
and
the
russians
have
learned
it
more
recently
barely
half
an
hour
did
admiral
togo
need
to
annihilate
the
russian
fleet
at
the
battle
of
tsushima
which
finally
decided
the
fate
of
japan
but
thousands
of
little
factors
small
and
remote
determined
that
success
causes
not
less
numerous
engendered
the
defeat
of
the
russians
a
bureaucracy
as
complicated
as
ours
and
as
irresponsible
lamentable
material
although
paid
for
by
its
weight
in
gold
a
system
of
graft
at
every
degree
of
the
social
hierarchy
and
general
indifference
to
the
interests
of
the
country
unhappily
the
progress
in
little
things
which
by
their
total
make
up
the
greatness
of
a
nation
is
rarely
apparent
produces
no
impression
on
the
public
and
can
not
serve
the
interests
of
politicians
at
elections
these
latter
care
nothing
for
such
matters
and
permit
the
accumulation
in
the
countries
subject
to
their
influence
of
the
little
successive
disorganisations
which
finally
result
in
great
downfalls
social
distinctions
in
democracies
and
democratic
ideas
in
various
countries
when
men
were
divided
into
castes
and
differentiated
chiefly
by
birth
social
distinctions
were
generally
accepted
as
the
consequences
of
an
unavoidable
natural
law
as
soon
as
the
old
social
divisions
were
destroyed
the
distinctions
of
the
classes
appeared
artificial
and
for
that
reason
ceased
to
be
tolerated
the
necessity
of
equality
being
theoretical
we
have
seen
among
democratic
peoples
the
rapid
development
of
artificial
inequalities
permitting
their
possessors
to
make
for
themselves
a
plainly
visible
supremacy
never
was
the
thirst
for
titles
and
decorations
so
general
as
in
really
democratic
countries
such
as
the
united
states
titles
and
decorations
do
not
exert
much
influence
and
fortune
alone
creates
distinctions
it
is
only
by
exception
that
we
see
wealthy
young
american
girls
allying
themselves
to
the
old
names
of
the
european
aristocracy
they
are
then
instinctively
employing
the
only
means
which
will
permit
a
young
race
to
acquire
a
past
that
will
establish
its
moral
framework
but
in
a
general
fashion
the
aristocracy
that
we
see
springing
up
in
america
is
by
no
means
founded
on
titles
and
decorations
purely
financial
it
does
not
provoke
much
jealousy
because
every
one
hopes
one
day
to
form
part
of
it
when
in
his
book
on
democracy
in
america
toqueville
spoke
of
the
general
aspiration
towards
equality
he
did
not
realise
that
the
prophesied
equality
would
end
in
the
classification
of
men
founded
exclusively
on
the
number
of
dollars
possessed
by
them
no
other
exists
in
the
united
states
and
it
will
doubtless
one
day
be
the
same
in
europe
at
present
we
can
not
possibly
regard
france
as
a
democratic
country
save
on
paper
and
here
we
feel
the
necessity
already
referred
to
of
examining
the
various
ideas
which
in
different
countries
are
expressed
by
the
word
democracy
of
truly
democratic
nations
we
can
practically
mention
only
england
and
the
united
states
there
democracy
occurs
in
different
forms
but
the
same
principles
are
observed
notably
a
perfect
toleration
of
all
opinions
religious
persecutions
are
unknown
real
superiority
easily
reveals
itself
in
the
various
professions
which
any
one
can
enter
at
any
age
if
he
possesses
the
necessary
capacity
there
is
no
barrier
to
individual
effort
in
such
countries
men
believe
themselves
equal
because
all
have
the
idea
that
they
are
free
to
attain
the
same
position
the
workman
knows
he
can
become
foreman
and
then
engineer
forced
to
begin
on
the
lower
rungs
of
the
ladder
instead
of
high
up
the
scale
as
in
france
the
engineer
does
not
regard
himself
as
made
of
different
stuff
to
the
rest
of
mankind
it
is
the
same
in
all
professions
this
is
why
the
class
hatred
so
intense
in
europe
is
so
little
developed
in
england
and
america
in
france
the
democracy
is
practically
save
in
speeches
a
system
of
competitions
and
examinations
which
must
be
worked
through
in
youth
firmly
closes
the
door
upon
the
liberal
professions
and
creates
inimical
and
separate
classes
the
latin
democracies
are
therefore
purely
theoretical
the
absolutism
of
the
state
has
replaced
monarchical
absolutism
but
it
is
no
less
severe
the
aristocracy
of
fortune
has
replaced
that
of
birth
and
its
privileges
are
no
less
considerable
monarchies
and
democracies
differ
far
more
in
form
than
in
substance
it
is
only
the
variable
mentality
of
men
that
varies
their
effects
all
the
discussions
as
to
various
systems
of
government
are
really
of
no
interest
for
these
have
no
special
virtue
of
themselves
their
value
will
always
depend
on
that
of
the
people
governed
a
people
effects
great
and
rapid
progress
when
it
discovers
that
it
is
the
sum
of
the
personal
efforts
of
each
individual
and
not
the
system
of
government
that
determines
the
rank
of
a
nation
in
the
world
chapter
iii
the
new
forms
of
democratic
belief
the
conflict
between
capital
and
labour
while
our
legislators
are
reforming
and
legislating
at
hazard
the
natural
evolution
of
the
world
is
slowly
pursuing
its
course
new
interests
arise
the
economic
competition
between
nation
and
nation
increases
in
severity
the
are
bestirring
themselves
and
on
all
sides
we
see
the
birth
of
formidable
problems
which
the
harangues
of
the
politicians
will
never
resolve
among
these
new
problems
one
of
the
most
complicated
will
be
the
problem
of
the
conflict
between
labour
and
capital
it
is
becoming
acute
even
in
such
a
country
of
tradition
as
england
workingmen
are
ceasing
to
respect
the
collective
contracts
which
formerly
constituted
their
charter
strikes
are
declared
for
insignificant
motives
and
unemployment
and
pauperism
are
attaining
disquieting
proportions
in
america
these
strikes
would
finally
have
affected
all
industries
but
that
the
very
excess
of
the
evil
created
a
remedy
during
the
last
ten
years
the
industrial
leaders
have
organised
great
employers
federations
which
have
become
powerful
enough
to
force
the
workers
to
submit
to
arbitration
the
labour
question
is
complicated
in
france
by
the
intervention
of
numerous
foreign
workers
which
the
stagnation
of
our
population
has
rendered
necessary
this
stagnation
will
also
make
it
difficult
for
france
to
contend
with
her
rivals
whose
soil
will
soon
no
longer
be
able
to
nourish
its
inhabitants
who
following
one
of
the
oldest
laws
of
history
will
necessarily
invade
the
less
densely
peopled
countries
population
of
the
great
powers
russia
germany
austria
england
france
these
conflicts
between
the
workers
and
employers
of
the
same
nation
will
be
rendered
still
more
acute
by
the
increasing
economic
struggle
between
the
asiatics
whose
needs
are
small
and
who
can
therefore
produce
manufactured
articles
at
very
low
prices
and
the
europeans
whose
needs
are
many
for
years
i
have
laid
stress
upon
this
point
general
hamilton
military
attache
to
the
japanese
army
who
foresaw
the
japanese
victories
long
before
the
outbreak
of
hostilities
writes
as
follows
in
an
essay
translated
by
general
langlois
the
chinaman
such
as
i
have
seen
him
in
manchuria
is
capable
of
destroying
the
present
type
of
worker
of
the
white
races
he
will
drive
him
off
the
face
of
the
earth
the
socialists
who
preach
equality
to
the
labourer
are
far
from
thinking
what
would
be
the
practical
result
of
carrying
out
their
theories
is
it
then
the
destiny
of
the
white
races
to
disappear
in
the
long
run
in
my
humble
opinion
this
destiny
depends
upon
one
single
factor
shall
we
or
shall
we
not
have
the
good
sense
to
close
our
ears
to
speeches
which
present
war
and
preparation
for
war
as
a
useless
evil
i
believe
the
workers
must
choose
given
the
present
constitution
of
the
world
they
must
cultivate
in
their
children
the
military
ideal
and
accept
gracefully
the
cost
and
trouble
which
militarism
entails
or
they
will
be
let
in
for
a
cruel
struggle
for
life
with
a
rival
worker
of
whose
success
there
is
not
the
slightest
doubt
there
is
only
one
means
of
refusing
asiatics
the
right
to
emigrate
to
lower
wages
by
competition
and
to
live
in
our
midst
and
that
is
the
sword
if
americans
and
europeans
forget
that
their
privileged
position
is
held
only
by
force
of
arms
asia
will
soon
have
taken
her
revenge
we
know
that
in
america
the
invasion
of
chinese
and
japanese
owing
to
the
competition
between
them
and
the
workers
of
white
race
has
become
a
national
calamity
in
europe
the
invasion
is
commencing
but
has
not
as
yet
gone
far
but
already
chinese
emigrants
have
formed
important
colonies
in
certain
centres
london
cardiff
liverpool
they
have
provoked
several
riots
by
working
for
low
wages
their
appearance
has
always
lowered
salaries
but
these
problems
belong
to
the
future
and
those
of
the
present
are
so
disquieting
that
it
is
useless
at
the
moment
to
occupy
ourselves
with
others
the
evolution
of
the
and
the
syndicalist
movement
the
most
important
democratic
problem
of
the
day
will
perhaps
result
from
the
recent
development
of
the
engendered
by
the
syndicalist
or
trades
union
movement
the
aggregation
of
similar
interests
known
as
syndicalism
has
rapidly
assumed
such
enormous
developments
in
all
countries
that
it
may
be
called
certain
corporations
have
budgets
comparable
to
those
of
small
states
some
german
leagues
have
been
cited
as
having
saved
over
three
millions
sterling
in
subscriptions
the
extension
of
the
labour
movement
in
all
countries
shows
that
it
is
not
like
socialism
a
dream
of
utopian
theorists
but
the
result
of
economic
necessities
in
its
aim
its
means
of
action
and
its
tendencies
syndicalism
presents
no
kinship
with
socialism
having
sufficiently
explained
it
in
my
political
psychology
it
will
suffice
here
to
recall
in
a
few
words
the
difference
between
the
two
doctrines
socialism
would
obtain
possession
of
all
industries
and
have
them
managed
by
the
state
which
would
distribute
the
products
equally
between
the
citizens
syndicalism
on
the
other
hand
would
entirely
eliminate
the
action
of
the
state
and
divide
society
into
small
professional
groups
which
would
be
although
despised
by
the
syndicalists
and
violently
attacked
by
them
the
socialists
are
trying
to
ignore
the
conflict
but
it
is
rapidly
becoming
too
obvious
to
be
concealed
the
political
influence
which
the
socialists
still
possess
will
soon
escape
them
if
syndicalism
is
everywhere
increasing
at
the
expense
of
socialism
it
is
i
repeat
because
this
corporative
movement
although
a
renewal
of
the
past
synthetises
certain
needs
born
of
the
specialisation
of
modern
industry
we
see
its
manifestations
under
a
great
variety
of
circumstances
in
france
its
success
has
not
as
yet
been
as
great
as
elsewhere
having
taken
the
revolutionary
form
already
mentioned
it
has
fallen
at
least
for
the
time
being
into
the
hands
of
the
anarchists
who
care
as
little
for
syndicalism
as
for
any
sort
of
organisation
and
are
simply
using
the
new
doctrine
in
an
attempt
to
destroy
modern
society
socialists
syndicalists
and
anarchists
although
directed
by
entirely
different
conceptions
are
thus
collaborating
in
the
same
eventual
aim
the
violent
suppression
of
the
ruling
classes
and
the
pillage
of
their
wealth
the
syndicalist
doctrine
does
not
in
any
way
derive
from
the
principles
of
revolution
on
many
points
it
is
entirely
in
contradiction
with
the
revolution
syndicalism
represents
rather
a
return
to
certain
forms
of
collective
organisation
similar
to
the
guilds
or
corporations
proscribed
by
the
revolution
it
thus
constitutes
one
of
those
federations
which
the
revolution
condemned
it
entirely
rejects
the
state
centralisation
which
the
revolution
established
syndicalism
cares
nothing
for
the
democratic
principles
of
liberty
equality
and
fraternity
the
syndicalists
demand
of
their
members
an
absolute
discipline
which
eliminates
all
liberty
not
being
as
yet
strong
enough
to
exercise
mutual
tyranny
the
syndicates
so
far
profess
sentiments
in
respect
of
one
another
which
might
by
a
stretch
be
called
fraternal
but
as
soon
as
they
are
sufficiently
powerful
when
their
contrary
interests
will
necessarily
enter
into
conflict
as
during
the
syndicalist
period
of
the
old
italian
republics
florence
and
siena
for
example
the
present
fraternity
will
speedily
be
forgotten
and
equality
will
be
replaced
by
the
despotism
of
the
most
powerful
such
a
future
seems
near
at
hand
the
new
power
is
increasing
very
rapidly
and
finds
the
governments
powerless
before
it
able
to
defend
themselves
only
by
yielding
to
every
demand
an
odious
policy
which
may
serve
for
the
moment
but
which
heavily
compromises
the
future
it
was
however
to
this
poor
recourse
that
the
english
government
recently
resorted
in
its
struggle
against
the
union
which
threatened
to
suspend
the
industrial
life
of
england
the
union
demanded
a
minimum
wage
for
its
members
but
they
were
not
bound
to
furnish
a
minimum
of
work
although
such
a
demand
was
inadmissible
the
government
agreed
to
propose
to
parliament
a
law
to
sanction
such
a
measure
we
may
profitably
read
the
weighty
words
pronounced
by
balfour
before
the
house
of
commons
the
country
has
never
in
its
so
long
and
varied
history
had
to
face
a
danger
of
this
nature
and
this
importance
we
are
confronted
with
the
strange
and
sinister
spectacle
of
a
mere
organisation
threatening
to
paralyse
and
paralysing
in
a
large
measure
the
commerce
and
manufactures
of
a
community
which
lives
by
commerce
and
manufacture
the
power
possessed
by
the
miners
is
in
the
present
state
of
the
law
almost
unlimited
have
we
ever
seen
the
like
of
it
did
ever
feudal
baron
exert
a
comparable
tyranny
was
there
ever
an
american
trust
which
served
the
rights
which
it
holds
from
the
law
with
such
contempt
of
the
general
interest
the
very
degree
of
perfection
to
which
we
have
brought
our
laws
our
social
organisation
the
mutual
relation
between
the
various
professions
and
industries
exposes
us
more
than
our
predecessors
in
ruder
ages
to
the
grave
peril
which
at
present
threatens
society
we
are
witnesses
at
the
present
moment
of
the
first
manifestation
of
the
power
of
elements
which
if
we
are
not
heedful
will
submerge
the
whole
of
society
the
attitude
of
the
government
in
yielding
to
the
injunction
of
the
miners
gives
some
appearance
of
reality
to
the
victory
of
those
who
are
pitting
themselves
against
society
why
certain
modern
democratic
governments
are
gradually
being
transformed
into
governments
by
administrative
castes
anarchy
and
the
social
conflicts
resulting
from
democratic
ideas
are
impelling
some
governments
towards
an
unforeseen
course
of
evolution
which
will
end
by
leaving
them
only
a
nominal
power
this
development
of
which
i
shall
briefly
denote
the
effects
is
effected
spontaneously
under
the
stress
of
those
imperious
necessities
which
are
still
the
chief
controlling
power
of
events
the
governments
of
democratic
countries
consist
of
the
representatives
elected
by
universal
suffrage
they
vote
laws
and
appoint
and
dismiss
ministers
chosen
from
themselves
and
provisionally
entrusted
with
the
executive
power
these
ministers
are
naturally
often
replaced
since
a
vote
will
do
it
those
who
follow
them
belonging
to
a
different
party
will
govern
according
to
different
principles
it
might
at
first
seem
that
a
country
thus
pulled
to
and
fro
by
various
influences
could
have
no
continuity
or
stability
but
in
spite
of
all
these
conditions
of
instability
a
democratic
government
like
that
of
france
works
with
fair
regularity
how
explain
such
a
phenomenon
its
interpretation
which
is
very
simple
results
from
the
fact
that
the
ministers
who
have
the
appearance
of
governing
really
govern
the
country
only
to
a
very
limited
extent
strictly
limited
and
circumscribed
their
power
is
exercised
principally
in
speeches
which
are
hardly
noticed
and
in
a
few
inorganic
measures
but
behind
the
superficial
authority
of
ministers
without
force
or
duration
the
playthings
of
every
demand
of
the
politician
an
anonymous
power
is
secretly
at
work
whose
might
is
continually
increasing
the
administrations
possessing
traditions
a
hierarchy
and
continuity
they
are
a
power
against
which
as
the
ministers
quickly
realise
they
are
incapable
of
struggling
responsibility
is
so
divided
in
the
administrative
machine
that
a
minister
may
never
find
himself
opposed
by
any
person
of
importance
his
momentary
impulses
are
checked
by
a
network
of
regulations
customs
and
decrees
which
are
continually
quoted
to
him
and
which
he
knows
so
little
that
he
dare
not
infringe
them
the
impotence
of
ministers
in
their
own
departments
has
been
well
described
by
one
of
them
cruppi
in
a
recent
book
the
most
ardent
wishes
of
the
minister
being
immediately
paralysed
by
his
department
he
promptly
ceases
to
struggle
against
it
this
diminution
of
the
power
of
democratic
governments
can
only
develop
one
of
the
most
constant
laws
of
history
is
that
of
which
i
have
already
spoken
immediately
any
one
class
becomes
preponderant
nobles
clergy
army
or
the
people
it
speedily
tends
to
enslave
others
such
were
the
roman
armies
which
finally
appointed
and
overthrew
the
emperors
such
were
the
clergy
against
whom
the
kings
of
old
could
hardly
struggle
such
were
the
states
general
which
at
the
moment
of
revolution
speedily
absorbed
all
the
powers
of
government
and
supplanted
the
monarchy
the
caste
of
functionaries
is
destined
to
furnish
a
fresh
proof
of
the
truth
of
this
law
preponderant
already
they
are
beginning
to
speak
loudly
to
make
threats
and
even
to
indulge
in
strikes
such
as
that
of
the
postmen
which
was
quickly
followed
by
that
of
the
government
railway
employees
the
administrative
power
thus
forms
a
little
state
within
the
state
and
if
its
present
rate
of
revolution
continues
it
will
soon
constitute
the
only
power
in
the
state
under
a
socialist
government
there
would
be
no
other
power
all
our
revolutions
would
then
have
resulted
in
stripping
the
king
of
his
powers
and
his
throne
in
order
to
bestow
them
upon
the
irresponsible
anonymous
and
despotic
class
of
government
clerks
to
foresee
the
issue
of
all
the
conflicts
which
threaten
to
cloud
the
future
is
impossible
we
must
steer
clear
of
pessimism
as
of
optimism
all
we
can
say
is
that
necessity
will
always
finally
bring
things
to
an
equilibrium
the
world
pursues
its
way
without
bothering
itself
with
our
speeches
and
sooner
or
later
we
manage
to
adapt
ourselves
to
the
variations
of
our
environment
the
difficulty
is
to
do
so
without
too
much
friction
and
above
all
to
resist
the
chimerical
conceptions
of
dreamers
always
powerless
to
the
world
they
have
often
contrived
to
upset
it
athens
rome
florence
and
many
other
cities
which
formerly
shone
in
history
were
victims
of
these
terrible
theorists
the
results
of
their
influence
has
always
been
the
same
anarchy
dictatorship
and
decadence
but
such
lessons
will
not
affect
the
numerous
catilines
of
the
present
day
they
do
not
yet
see
that
the
movements
unchained
by
their
ambitions
threaten
to
submerge
them
all
these
utopians
have
awakened
impossible
hopes
in
the
mind
of
the
crowd
excited
their
appetites
and
sapped
the
dykes
which
have
been
slowly
erected
during
the
centuries
to
restrain
them
the
struggle
of
the
blind
multitudes
against
the
elect
is
one
of
the
continuous
facts
of
history
and
the
triumph
of
popular
sovereignties
without
counterpoise
has
already
marked
the
end
of
more
than
one
civilisation
the
elect
create
the
plebs
destroys
as
soon
as
the
first
lose
their
hold
the
latter
begins
its
precious
work
the
great
civilisations
have
only
prospered
by
dominating
their
lower
elements
it
is
not
only
in
greece
that
anarchy
dictatorship
invasion
and
finally
the
loss
of
independence
has
resulted
from
the
despotism
of
a
democracy
individual
tyranny
is
always
born
of
collective
tyranny
it
ended
the
first
cycle
of
the
greatness
of
rome
the
barbarians
achieved
the
second
conclusions
the
principal
revolutions
of
history
have
been
studied
in
this
volume
but
we
have
dealt
more
especially
with
the
most
important
of
all
that
which
for
more
than
twenty
years
overwhelmed
all
europe
and
whose
echoes
are
still
to
be
heard
the
french
revolution
is
an
inexhaustible
mine
of
psychological
documents
no
period
of
the
life
of
humanity
has
presented
such
a
mass
of
experience
accumulated
in
so
short
a
time
on
each
page
of
this
great
drama
we
have
found
numerous
applications
of
the
principles
expounded
in
my
various
works
concerning
the
transitory
mentality
of
crowds
and
the
permanent
soul
of
the
peoples
the
action
of
beliefs
the
influence
of
mystic
affective
and
collective
elements
and
the
conflict
between
the
various
forms
of
logic
the
revolutionary
assemblies
illustrate
all
the
known
laws
of
the
psychology
of
crowds
impulsive
and
timid
they
are
dominated
by
a
small
number
of
leaders
and
usually
act
in
a
sense
contrary
to
the
wishes
of
their
individual
members
the
royalist
constituent
assembly
destroyed
an
ancient
monarchy
the
humanitarian
legislative
assembly
allowed
the
massacres
of
september
the
same
pacific
body
led
france
into
the
most
formidable
campaigns
there
were
similar
contradictions
during
the
convention
the
immense
majority
of
its
members
abhorred
violence
sentimental
philosophers
they
exalted
equality
fraternity
and
liberty
yet
ended
by
exerting
the
most
terrible
despotism
the
same
contradictions
were
visible
during
the
directory
extremely
moderate
in
their
intentions
at
the
outset
the
assemblies
were
continually
effecting
bloodthirsty
coups
they
wished
to
religious
peace
and
finally
sent
thousands
of
priests
into
imprisonment
they
wished
to
repair
the
ruins
which
covered
france
and
only
succeeded
in
adding
to
them
thus
there
was
always
a
complete
contradiction
between
the
individual
wills
of
the
men
of
the
revolutionary
period
and
the
deeds
of
the
assemblies
of
which
they
were
units
the
truth
is
that
they
obeyed
invisible
forces
of
which
they
were
not
the
masters
believing
that
they
acted
in
the
name
of
pure
reason
they
were
really
subject
to
mystic
affective
and
collective
influences
incomprehensible
to
them
and
which
we
are
only
beginning
to
understand
intelligence
has
progressed
in
the
course
of
the
ages
and
has
opened
a
marvellous
outlook
to
man
although
his
character
the
real
foundation
of
his
mind
and
the
sure
motive
of
his
actions
has
scarcely
changed
overthrown
one
moment
it
reappears
the
next
human
nature
must
be
accepted
as
it
is
the
founders
of
the
revolution
did
not
resign
themselves
to
the
facts
of
human
nature
for
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
humanity
they
attempted
to
transform
men
and
society
in
the
name
of
reason
never
was
any
undertaking
commenced
with
such
chances
of
success
the
theorists
who
claimed
to
effect
it
had
a
power
in
their
hands
greater
than
that
of
any
despot
yet
despite
this
power
despite
the
success
of
the
armies
despite
draconian
laws
and
repeated
coups
the
revolution
merely
heaped
ruin
upon
ruin
and
ended
in
a
dictatorship
such
an
attempt
was
not
useless
since
experience
is
necessary
to
the
education
of
the
peoples
without
the
revolution
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
prove
that
pure
reason
does
not
enable
us
to
change
human
nature
and
consequently
that
no
society
can
be
rebuilt
by
the
will
of
legislators
however
absolute
their
power
commenced
by
the
middle
classes
for
their
own
profit
the
revolution
speedily
became
a
popular
movement
and
at
the
same
time
a
struggle
of
the
instinctive
against
the
rational
a
revolt
against
all
the
constraints
which
make
civilisation
out
of
barbarism
it
was
by
relying
on
the
principle
of
popular
sovereignty
that
the
reformers
attempted
to
impose
their
doctrines
guided
by
leaders
the
people
intervened
incessantly
in
the
deliberations
of
the
assemblies
and
committed
the
most
sanguinary
acts
of
violence
the
history
of
the
multitudes
during
the
revolution
is
eminently
instructive
it
shows
the
error
of
the
politicians
who
attribute
all
the
virtues
to
the
popular
soul
the
facts
of
the
revolution
teach
us
on
the
contrary
that
a
people
freed
from
social
constraints
the
foundations
of
civilisation
and
abandoned
to
its
instinctive
impulses
speedily
relapses
into
its
ancestral
savagery
every
popular
revolution
which
succeeds
in
triumphing
is
a
temporary
return
to
barbarism
if
the
commune
of
had
lasted
it
would
have
repeated
the
terror
not
having
the
power
to
kill
so
many
people
it
had
to
confine
itself
to
burning
the
principal
monuments
of
the
capital
the
revolution
represents
the
conflict
of
psychological
forces
liberated
from
the
bonds
whose
function
it
is
to
restrain
them
popular
instincts
jacobin
beliefs
ancestral
influences
appetites
and
passions
unloosed
all
these
various
influences
engaged
in
a
furious
mutual
conflict
for
the
space
of
ten
years
during
which
time
they
soaked
france
in
blood
and
covered
the
land
with
ruins
seen
from
a
distance
this
seems
to
be
the
whole
upshot
of
the
revolution
there
was
nothing
homogeneous
about
it
one
must
resort
to
analysis
before
one
can
understand
and
grasp
the
great
drama
and
display
the
impulses
which
continually
actuated
its
heroes
in
normal
times
we
are
guided
by
the
various
forms
of
logic
rational
affective
collective
and
mystic
which
more
or
less
perfectly
balance
one
another
during
seasons
of
upheaval
they
enter
into
conflict
and
man
is
no
longer
himself
we
have
by
no
means
undervalued
in
this
work
the
importance
of
certain
acquisitions
of
the
revolution
in
respect
of
the
rights
of
the
people
but
with
many
other
historians
we
are
forced
to
admit
that
the
prize
gained
at
the
cost
of
such
ruin
and
bloodshed
would
have
been
obtained
at
a
later
date
without
effort
by
the
mere
progress
of
civilisation
for
a
few
years
gained
what
a
load
of
material
disaster
what
moral
disintegration
we
are
still
suffering
as
a
result
of
the
latter
these
brutal
pages
in
the
book
of
history
will
take
long
to
efface
they
are
not
effaced
as
yet
our
young
men
of
seem
to
prefer
action
to
thought
disdaining
the
sterile
dissertations
of
the
philosophers
they
take
no
interest
in
vain
speculation
concerning
matters
whose
essential
nature
remains
unknown
action
is
certainly
an
excellent
thing
and
all
real
progress
is
a
result
of
action
but
it
is
only
useful
when
properly
directed
the
men
of
the
revolution
were
assuredly
men
of
action
yet
the
illusions
which
they
accepted
as
guides
led
them
to
disaster
action
is
always
hurtful
when
despising
realities
it
professes
violently
to
change
the
course
of
events
one
can
not
experiment
with
society
as
with
apparatus
in
a
laboratory
our
political
upheavals
show
us
what
such
social
errors
may
cost
although
the
lesson
of
the
revolution
was
extremely
categorical
many
unpractical
spirits
hallucinated
by
their
dreams
are
hoping
to
recommence
it
socialism
the
modern
synthesis
of
this
hope
would
be
a
regression
to
lower
forms
of
evolution
for
it
would
paralyse
the
greatest
sources
of
our
activity
by
replacing
individual
initiative
and
responsibility
by
collective
initiative
and
responsibility
mankind
would
descend
several
steps
on
the
scale
of
human
values
the
present
time
is
hardly
favourable
to
such
experiments
while
dreamers
are
pursuing
their
dreams
exciting
appetites
and
the
passions
of
the
multitude
the
peoples
are
every
day
arming
themselves
more
powerfully
all
feel
that
amid
the
universal
competition
of
the
present
time
there
is
no
room
for
weak
nations
in
the
centre
of
europe
a
formidable
military
power
is
increasing
in
strength
and
aspiring
to
dominate
the
world
in
order
to
find
outlets
for
its
goods
and
for
an
increasing
population
which
it
will
soon
be
unable
to
nourish
if
we
continue
to
shatter
our
cohesion
by
intestine
struggles
party
rivalries
base
religious
persecutions
and
laws
which
fetter
industrial
development
our
part
in
the
world
will
soon
be

we
shall
have
to
make
room
for
peoples
more
solidly
knit
who
have
been
able
to
adapt
themselves
to
natural
necessities
instead
of
pretending
to
turn
