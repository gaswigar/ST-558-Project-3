a

night
a
toast
with
musical
honours
was
being
drunk
in
the
sweltering
of
the

mess
the
enthusiastic
hubbub
spread
far
for
every
door
and
window
was
flung
wide
though
the
season
was
yet
in
its
infancy
the
heat
was
intense

the
reputation
in

army
for
being
one
of

hottest
corners
in

in

and
kurrumpore

had
not

chosen
for

so
few
indeed
did
it
possess
in
the
eyes
of
europeans
that
none
ever
went
there
save
those
whom
an
inexorable
fate
compelled
the
rickety
wooden
bungalows
scattered
about
the
cantonment
were
temporary
lodgings
not
the
women
of
the
community
like
migratory
birds
dwelt
in
them
for
barely
four
months
in
the
year
flitting
with
the
coming
of
the
pitiless
heat
to
bhulwana
their
little
paradise
in
the
hills
but
that
was
a
hours
journey
away
and
the
men
had
to
be
content
with
an
occasional
week
leave
from
the
depths
of
their
inferno
unless
as
tommy
denvers
put
it
they
were
lucky
enough
to
go
sick
in
which
case
their
sojourn
in
paradise
was
prolonged
much
to
the
delight
of
the
angels
but
on
that
hot
night
the
annual
flitting
of
the
angels
had
not
yet
come
to
pass
and
notwithstanding
the
heat
the
last
dance
of
the
season
was
to
take
place
at
the
club
house
the
occasion
was
an
exceptional
one
as
the
jovial
sounds
that
issued
from
the
officers
testified
round
after
round
of
cheers
followed
the
noisy
toast
filling
the
night
with
the
merry
uproar
that
echoed
far
and
wide
a
confusion
of
voices
succeeded
these
and
then
by
degrees
the
babel
died
down
and
a
single
voice
made
itself
heard
it
spoke
with
easy
fluency
to
the
evident
appreciation
of
its
listeners
and
when
it
ceased
there
came
another
hearty
cheer
then
with
jokes
and
careless
laughter
the
little
company
of
british
officers
began
to
disperse
they
came
forth
in
lounging
groups
on
to
the
steps
of
the
the
foremost
of
them
tommy
denvers
holding
the
arm
of
his
captain
who
suffered
the
familiarity
as
he
suffered
most
things
with
the
utmost
indifference
none
but
tommy
ever
attempted
to
get
on
familiar
terms
with
everard
monck
he
was
essentially
a
man
who
stood
alone
but
the
slim
young
subaltern
worshipped
him
openly
and
with
reason
for
monck
it
was
who
grimly
resolute
had
pulled
him
through
the
worst
illness
he
had
ever
known
accomplishing
by
sheer
force
of
will
what
ralston
the
doctor
had
failed
to
accomplish
by
any
other
means
and
in
consequence
and
for
all
time
the
youngest
subaltern
in
the
mess
had
become
monck
devoted
adherent
they
stood
together
for
a
moment
at
the
top
of
the
steps
while
monck
his
dark
lean
face
wholly
unresponsive
and
inscrutable
took
out
a
cigar
the
night
was
a
wonderland
of
deep
spaces
and
glittering
stars
somewhere
far
away
a
native
throbbed
like
the
beating
of
a
fevered
pulse
quickening
spasmodically
at
intervals
and
then
dying
away
again
into
mere
monotony
the
air
was
scentless
still
and
heavy
it
going
to
be
deuced
warm
said
tommy
have
a
smoke
said
monck
proffering
his
case
the
boy
smiled
with
swift
gratification
oh
thanks
awfully
but
it
a
shame
to
hurry
over
a
good
cigar
and
i
promised
stella
to
go
straight
back
a
promise
is
a
promise
said
monck
have
it
later
he
added
rather
curtly
i
going
your
way
myself
good
said
tommy
heartily
but
are
you
going
to
show
at
the
club
house
are
you
going
to
dance
monck
tossed
down
his
lighted
match
and
set
his
heel
on
it
i
keeping
my
dancing
for
he
said
the
best
man
always
has
more
than
enough
of
that
tommy
made
a
gloomy
sound
that
was
like
a
groan
and
began
to
descend
the
steps
by
his
side
they
walked
several
paces
along
the
dim
road
in
silence
then
quite
suddenly
he
burst
into
impulsive
speech
i
tell
you
what
it
is
monck
i
should
said
monck
tommy
checked
abruptly
looking
at
him
oddly
uncertainly
how
do
you
know
what
i
was
going
to
say
he
demanded
i
do
said
monck
i
believe
you
do
said
tommy
unconvinced
monck
blew
forth
a
cloud
of
smoke
and
laughed
in
his
brief
rather
grudging
way
you
getting
quite
clever
for
a
child
of
your
age
he
observed
but
do
overdo
it
my
son
do
get
precocious
tommy
hand
grasped
his
arm
confidentially
monck
if
i
do
speak
out
to
someone
i
shall
bust
surely
you
do
mind
my
speaking
out
to
you
not
if
there
anything
to
be
gained
by
it
said
monck
he
ignored
the
friendly
persuasive
hand
on
his
arm
but
yet
in
some
fashion
tommy
knew
that
it
was
not
unwelcome
he
kept
it
there
as
he
made
reply
there
is
only
you
know
old
chap
it
does
a
fellow
good
to
unburden
himself
and
i
bothered
to
death
about
this
business
a
bit
late
in
the
day
is
it
suggested
monck
oh
yes
i
know
too
late
to
do
anything
but
tommy
spoke
with
force
the
nearer
it
gets
the
worse
i
feel
i
downright
sick
about
it
and
that
the
truth
how
would
you
feel
i
wonder
if
you
knew
your
one
and
only
sister
was
going
to
marry
a
rotter
would
you
be
satisfied
to
let
things
drift
monck
was
silent
for
a
space
they
walked
on
over
the
dusty
road
with
the
free
swing
of
the
conquering
race
one
or
two
met
them
as
they
went
and
a
woman
voice
called
a
greeting
but
though
they
both
responded
it
scarcely
served
as
a
diversion
the
silence
between
them
remained
monck
spoke
at
last
briefly
with
grim
restraint
that
rather
a
sweeping
assertion
of
yours
i
should
repeat
it
if
i
were
you
it
true
all
the
same
maintained
tommy
you
know
it
true
i
know
nothing
said
monck
i
nothing
whatever
against
dacre
you
nothing
in
favour
of
him
anyway
growled
tommy
nothing
particular
but
i
presume
your
sister
has
there
was
just
a
hint
of
irony
in
the
quiet
rejoinder
tommy
winced
stella
great
scott
no
she
does
care
the
toss
of
a
halfpenny
for
him
i
know
that
now
she
only
accepted
him
because
she
found
herself
in
such
a
beastly
anomalous
position
with
all
the
spiteful
cats
of
the
regiment
arrayed
against
her
treating
her
like
a
pariah
did
she
tell
you
so
there
was
no
irony
in
monck
tone
this
time
it
fell
short
and
stern
again
tommy
glanced
at
him
as
one
uncertain
not
likely
he
said
then
why
do
you
make
the
assertion
what
grounds
have
you
for
making
the
assertion
monck
spoke
with
insistence
as
one
who
meant
to
have
an
answer
and
the
boy
answered
him
albeit
shamefacedly
i
really
ca
say
monck
i
the
sort
of
fool
that
sees
things
without
being
able
to
explain
how
but
that
stella
has
the
faintest
spark
of
real
love
for
that
fellow
dacre
well
i
take
my
dying
oath
that
she
has
some
women
do
go
in
for
that
sort
of
thing
commented
monck
dryly
stella
is
that
sort
of
woman
hotly
came
tommy
defence
you
do
know
her
she
a
lot
deeper
than
i
am
monck
laughed
a
little
oh
you
deep
enough
tommy
but
transparent
as
well
now
your
sister
on
the
other
hand
is
quite
inscrutable
but
it
is
not
for
us
to
interfere
she
probably
knows
what
she
is
doing
very
well
indeed
that
just
it
does
she
know
is
she
taking
a
most
awful
leap
in
the
dark
keen
anxiety
sounded
in
tommy
voice
it
been
such
horribly
quick
work
you
know
why
she
has
been
out
here
six
weeks
it
a
shame
for
any
girl
to
marry
on
such
short
notice
as
that
i
said
so
to
her
and
she
she
laughed
and
said
that
beggar
choice
do
you
think
i
could
enjoy
life
with
your
angels
in
paradise
in
unmarried
bliss
i
sooner
stay
down
in
hell
with
you
and
she
have
done
it
too
monck
and
it
would
probably
have
killed
her
that
partly
how
i
came
to
know
have
the
women
been
decent
to
her
monck
question
fell
curtly
as
if
the
subject
were
one
which
he
was
reluctant
to
discuss
tommy
looked
at
him
through
the
starlight
you
know
what
they
are
he
said
bluntly
they
hunt
anybody
if
once
lady
harriet
gave
tongue
she
chose
to
eye
stella
askance
from
the
very
outset
and
of
course
all
the
rest
followed
suit
ralston
is
the
only
one
in
the
whole
crowd
who
has
ever
treated
her
decently
but
of
course
she
nobody
everyone
sits
on
her
as
if
he
spoke
with
heat
stella
were
as
good
as
the
best
of
and
better
what
right
have
they
to
treat
her
like
a
social
outcast
just
because
she
came
out
here
to
me
on
her
own
it
hateful
it
iniquitous
what
else
could
she
have
done
it
seems
reasonable
from
a
man
point
of
view
said
monck
it
was
reasonable
it
was
the
only
thing
possible
and
just
for
that
they
chose
to
turn
the
cold
shoulder
on
her
to
ostracize
her
practically
what
had
she
done
to
them
what
right
had
they
to
treat
her
like
that
fierce
resentment
sounded
in
tommy
voice
i
tell
you
if
you
want
to
know
said
monck
abruptly
it
the
law
of
the
pack
to
rend
an
outsider
and
your
sister
will
always
be
that
married
or
otherwise
they
may
fawn
upon
her
later
dacre
being
one
to
hold
his
own
with
women
but
they
will
always
hate
her
in
their
hearts
you
see
she
is
beautiful
is
she
said
tommy
in
surprise
do
you
know
i
never
thought
of
that
monck
laughed
a
cold
sardonic
laugh
quite
so
you
would
but
dacre
has
and
a
few
more
of
us
oh
confound
dacre
tommy
irritation
returned
with
a
rush
i
detest
the
man
he
behaves
as
if
he
were
conferring
a
favour
when
he
was
making
that
speech
i
wanted
to
fling
my
glass
at
him
ah
but
you
must
do
those
things
monck
spoke
reprovingly
you
may
be
young
but
you
past
the
schoolboy
stage
dacre
is
more
of
a
woman
favourite
than
a
man
you
must
remember
if
your
sister
is
not
in
love
with
him
she
is
about
the
only
woman
in
the
station
who
is
that
the
disgusting
part
of
it
fumed
tommy
he
makes
love
to
every
woman
he
meets
they
had
reached
a
shadowy
compound
that
bordered
the
dusty
road
for
a
few
yards
a
little
eddying
wind
made
a
mysterious
whisper
among
its
thirsty
shrubs
the
bungalow
it
surrounded
showed
dimly
in
the
starlight
a
wooden
structure
with
a
raised
verandah
and
a
flight
of
steps
leading
up
to
it
a
light
thrown
by
a
lamp
shone
out
from
one
of
the
rooms
casting
a
shaft
of
ruddy
brilliance
into
the
night
as
though
it
defied
the
splendour
without
it
shone
upon
face
as
he
paused
showing
it
troubled
and
anxious
you
may
as
well
come
in
he
said
she
is
sure
to
be
ready
come
in
and
have
a
drink
monck
stood
still
his
dark
face
was
in
shadow
he
seemed
to
be
debating
some
point
with
himself
finally
all
right
just
for
a
minute
he
said
but
look
here
tommy
do
you
let
your
sister
suspect
that
you
been
making
a
confidant
of
me
i
do
fancy
it
would
please
her
put
on
a
grin
man
do
look
bowed
down
with
family
cares
she
is
probably
quite
capable
of
looking
after
herself
like
the
rest
of
he
clapped
a
careless
hand
on
the
lad
shoulder
as
they
turned
up
the
path
together
towards
the
streaming
red
light
you
a
bit
of
a
are
you
said
tommy
and
monck
laughed
again
his
short
rather
bitter
laugh
but
he
said
no
word
in
answer
chapter

the
prisoner
at
the
bar
in
the
room
with
the
lamp
stella
denvers
sat
waiting
the
red
glow
compassed
her
warmly
striking
wonderful
copper
gleams
in
the
burnished
coils
of
her
hair
her
face
was
bent
over
the
long
white
gloves
that
she
was
pulling
over
her
wrists
a
pale
face
that
yet
was
extraordinarily
vivid
with
features
that
were
delicate
and
proud
and
lips
that
had
the
exquisite
softness
and
purity
of
a
flower
she
raised
her
eyes
from
her
task
at
sound
of
the
steps
below
the
window
and
their
starry
brightness
under
her
straight
black
brows
gave
her
an
infinite
allurement
certainly
a
beautiful
woman
as
monck
had
said
and
possessing
the
brilliance
and
the
wonder
of
youth
to
an
almost
dazzling
degree
perhaps
it
was
not
altogether
surprising
that
the
ladies
of
the
regiment
had
not
been
too
enthusiastic
in
their
welcome
of
this
sister
of
tommy
who
had
come
so
suddenly
into
their
midst
defying
convention
her
advent
had
been
utterly
unexpected
a
total
surprise
even
to
tommy
who
returning
one
day
from
the
had
found
her
awaiting
him
in
the
bachelor
quarters
which
he
had
shared
with
three
other
subalterns
and
her
arrival
had
set
the
whole
station
buzzing
led
by
the
colonel
wife
lady
harriet
mansfield
the
women
of
the
regiment
had
with
the
single
exception
of
ralston
whose
opinion
was
of
no
account
risen
and
condemned
the
splendid
stranger
who
had
come
amongst
them
with
such
supreme
audacity
and
eclipsed
the
fairest
of
them
stella
own
simple
explanation
that
she
had
upon
attaining
her
majority
and
fifty
pounds
a
year
decided
to
quit
the
home
of
some
distant
relatives
who
did
not
want
her
and
join
tommy
who
was
the
only
near
relation
she
had
had
satisfied
no
one
she
was
an
interloper
and
as
such
they
united
to
treat
her
as
lady
harriet
said
no
nice
girl
would
have
dreamed
of
taking
such
an
extraordinary
step
and
she
had
not
the
smallest
intention
of
offering
her
the
chaperonage
that
she
so
conspicuously
lacked
if
ralston
chose
to
do
so
that
was
her
own
affair
such
action
on
the
part
of
the
surgeon
very
ordinary
wife
would
make
no
difference
to
any
one
she
was
glad
to
think
that
all
the
other
ladies
were
too
to
accept
without
reservation
so
unconventional
a
type
the
fact
that
she
was
tommy
sister
was
the
only
consideration
in
her
favour
tommy
was
quite
a
nice
boy
and
they
could
not
for
his
sake
entirely
exclude
her
from
the
regimental
society
but
to
no
intimate
gathering
was
she
ever
invited
nor
from
the
female
portion
of
the
community
was
there
any
welcome
for
her
at
the
club
the
attitude
of
the
officers
of
the
regiment
was
of
a
totally
different
nature
they
had
accepted
her
with
enthusiasm
possibly
all
the
more
marked
on
account
of
the
aloofness
of
their
women
folk
and
in
a
very
short
time
they
were
paying
her
homage
as
one
man
the
subalterns
who
had
shared
their
quarters
with
tommy
turned
out
to
make
room
for
her
treating
her
like
a
queen
suddenly
come
into
her
own
and
like
a
queen
she
entered
into
possession
accepting
all
courtesy
just
as
she
ignored
all
slights
with
a
delicate
that
yet
knew
how
to
be
gracious
when
occasion
demanded
ralston
would
have
offered
her
harbourage
had
she
desired
it
but
there
was
pride
in
stella
a
pride
that
surged
and
rebelled
very
far
below
her
serenity
she
received
favours
from
none
and
so
unshackled
and
unchaperoned
she
had
gone
her
way
among
her
critics
and
no
one
not
even
tommy
suspected
how
deep
was
the
wound
that
their
hostility
had
inflicted
in
bitterness
of
soul
she
hid
it
from
all
the
world
and
only
her
brother
and
her
grim
and
somewhat
unapproachable
captain
were
even
vaguely
aware
of
its
existence
everard
monck
was
one
of
the
very
few
men
who
had
not
laid
themselves
down
before
her
dainty
feet
and
she
had
gradually
come
to
believe
that
this
man
shared
the
silent
disapproval
manifested
by
the
women
very
strangely
that
belief
hurt
her
even
more
deeply
in
a
subtle
incomprehensible
fashion
than
any
slights
inflicted
by
her
own
sex
possibly
tommy
warm
enthusiasm
for
the
man
had
made
her
more
sensitive
regarding
his
good
opinion
and
possibly
she
was
over
ready
to
read
condemnation
in
his
grave
eyes
but
whatever
the
reason
she
would
have
given
much
to
have
had
him
on
her
side
somehow
it
mattered
to
her
and
mattered
vitally
but
monck
had
never
joined
her
retinue
of
courtiers
he
was
never
other
than
courteous
to
her
but
he
did
not
seek
her
out
perhaps
he
had
better
things
to
do
aloof
impenetrable
cold
he
passed
her
by
and
she
would
have
been
even
more
amazed
than
tommy
had
she
heard
him
describe
her
as
beautiful
so
convinced
was
she
that
he
saw
in
her
no
charm
it
had
been
a
disheartening
struggle
this
hewing
for
herself
a
way
along
the
rocky
paths
of
prejudice
and
many
had
been
the
thorns
under
her
feet
though
she
kept
a
brave
heart
and
never
faltered
she
had
tired
inevitably
of
the
perpetual
effort
it
entailed
three
weeks
after
her
arrival
when
the
annual
exodus
of
the
ladies
of
the
regiment
to
the
hills
was
drawing
near
she
became
engaged
to
ralph
dacre
the
handsomest
and
most
irresponsible
man
in
the
mess
with
him
at
least
her
power
to
attract
was
paramount
he
was
blindly
almost
fulsomely
in
love
her
beauty
went
to
his
head
from
the
outset
it
fired
his
blood
he
worshipped
her
hotly
and
pursued
her
untiringly
caring
little
whether
she
returned
his
devotion
so
long
as
he
ultimately
took
possession
and
when
finally
she
yielded
to
his
insistence
his
one
thought
became
to
clinch
the
bargain
before
she
could
repent
of
it
it
was
a
mad
and
headlong
passion
that
drove
him
not
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
and
the
subtle
pride
of
her
and
the
soft
reserve
made
her
all
the
more
desirable
in
his
eyes
he
had
won
her
he
did
not
stop
to
ask
himself
how
the
women
said
that
the
luck
was
all
on
her
side
the
men
forebore
to
express
an
opinion
dacre
had
attained
his
captaincy
but
he
was
not
regarded
with
great
respect
by
any
one
his
shrugged
their
shoulders
over
him
and
the
commanding
officer
colonel
mansfield
had
been
heard
to
call
him
the
craziest
madman
it
had
ever
been
his
fate
to
meet
no
one
except
tommy
actively
disliked
him
and
he
had
no
grounds
for
so
doing
as
monck
had
pointed
out
monck
who
till
then
had
occupied
the
same
bungalow
declared
he
had
nothing
against
him
and
he
was
surely
in
a
position
to
form
a
very
shrewd
opinion
for
monck
was
neither
fool
nor
madman
and
there
was
very
little
that
escaped
his
silent
observation
he
was
acting
as
best
man
at
the
morrow
ceremony
the
function
having
been
almost
thrust
upon
him
by
dacre
who
oddly
enough
shared
something
of
tommy
veneration
for
his
very
reticent
there
was
scant
friendship
between
them
each
had
been
accustomed
to
go
his
own
way
wholly
independent
of
the
other
they
were
no
more
than
casual
acquaintances
and
they
were
content
to
remain
such
but
undoubtedly
dacre
entertained
a
certain
respect
for
monck
and
observed
a
wariness
of
behaviour
in
his
presence
that
he
never
troubled
to
assume
for
any
other
man
he
was
careful
in
his
dealings
with
him
being
at
all
times
not
wholly
certain
of
his
ground
other
men
felt
the
same
uncertainty
in
connection
with
monck
none
save
tommy
was
sure
what
manner
of
man
he
was
tommy
alone
took
him
for
granted
with
admiration
and
at
his
earnest
wish
it
had
been
arranged
between
them
that
monck
should
take
up
his
abode
with
him
when
the
forthcoming
marriage
had
deprived
each
of
a
companion
tommy
was
delighted
with
the
idea
and
he
had
a
gratifying
suspicion
that
monck
himself
was
inclined
to
be
pleased
with
it
also
the
green
bungalow
had
become
considerably
more
homelike
since
arrival
and
tommy
meant
to
keep
it
so
he
was
sure
that
monck
and
he
would
have
the
same
tastes
and
so
on
that
eve
of
his
sister
wedding
the
thought
of
their
coming
companionship
was
the
sole
redeeming
feature
of
the
whole
affair
and
he
turned
in
his
impulsive
fashion
to
say
so
just
as
they
reached
the
verandah
steps
but
the
words
did
not
leave
his
lips
for
the
red
glow
flung
from
the
lamp
had
found
monck
upturned
face
and
something
something
about
it
checked
all
speech
for
the
moment
he
was
looking
straight
up
at
the
lighted
window
and
the
face
of
a
beautiful
woman
who
gazed
forth
into
the
night
and
his
eyes
were
no
longer
cold
and
unresponsive
but
burning
ardent
intensely
alive
tommy
forgot
what
he
was
going
to
say
and
only
stared
the
moment
passed
it
was
scarcely
so
much
as
a
moment
and
monck
moved
on
in
his
calm
unfaltering
way
your
sister
is
ready
and
waiting
he
said
they
ascended
the
steps
together
and
the
girl
who
sat
by
the
open
window
rose
with
a
stately
movement
and
stepped
forward
to
meet
them
hullo
stella
was
tommy
greeting
hope
i
not
awfully
late
they
wasted
such
a
confounded
time
over
toasts
at
mess
yours
was
one
of
and
i
had
to
reply
i
had
a
notion
what
to
say
captain
monck
thinks
i
made
an
awful
hash
of
it
though
he
is
too
considerate
to
say
so
on
the
contrary
i
said
hear
to
every
stutter
said
monck
bowing
slightly
as
he
took
the
hand
she
offered
she
was
wearing
a
black
lace
dress
with
a
glittering
spangled
scarf
of
indian
gauze
floating
about
her
her
neck
and
shoulders
gleamed
in
the
soft
red
glow
she
was
superb
that
night
she
smiled
at
monck
and
her
smile
was
as
a
shining
cloak
hiding
her
soul
so
you
have
started
upon
your
official
duties
already
she
said
it
is
the
best
man
business
to
encourage
and
console
everyone
concerned
is
it
the
faint
cynicism
of
her
speech
was
like
her
smile
it
held
back
all
intrusive
curiosity
and
the
man
answering
smile
had
something
of
the
same
quality
reserve
met
reserve
i
hope
i
shall
not
find
it
very
arduous
in
that
respect
he
said
i
did
not
come
here
in
that
capacity
i
am
glad
of
that
she
said
wo
you
come
in
and
sit
down
she
motioned
him
within
with
a
queenly
gesture
but
her
invitation
was
wholly
lacking
in
warmth
it
was
tommy
who
pressed
forward
with
eager
hospitality
yes
and
have
a
drink
it
a
thirsty
right
it
getting
infernally
hot
stella
you
lucky
to
be
going
out
of
it
oh
i
am
very
lucky
stella
said
they
entered
the
lighted
room
and
tommy
went
in
search
of
refreshment
wo
you
sit
down
said
stella
her
voice
was
deep
and
pure
and
the
music
in
it
made
him
wonder
if
she
sang
he
sat
facing
her
while
she
returned
with
apparent
absorption
to
the
fastening
of
her
gloves
she
spoke
again
after
a
moment
without
raising
her
eyes
are
you
proposing
to
take
up
your
abode
here
that
the
idea
said
monck
i
hope
you
and
tommy
will
be
quite
comfortable
she
said
no
doubt
he
will
be
a
good
deal
happier
with
you
than
he
has
been
for
the
past
few
weeks
with
me
i
do
know
why
he
should
be
said
monck
no
she
was
frowning
slightly
over
her
glove
you
see
my
sojourn
here
has
not
been
a
great
success
i
think
poor
tommy
has
felt
it
rather
badly
he
likes
a
genial
atmosphere
he
wo
get
much
of
that
in
my
company
observed
monck
she
smiled
momentarily
perhaps
not
but
i
think
he
will
not
be
sorry
to
be
relieved
of
family
cares
they
have
weighed
rather
heavily
upon
him
he
will
be
sorry
to
lose
you
said
monck
oh
of
course
in
a
way
but
he
will
soon
get
over
that
she
looked
up
at
him
suddenly
you
will
all
be
rather
thankful
when
i
am
safely
married
captain
monck
she
said
there
was
a
second
or
two
of
silence
monck
eyes
looked
straight
back
into
hers
while
it
lasted
but
they
held
no
warmth
scarcely
even
interest
i
really
do
know
why
you
should
say
that
miss
denvers
he
said
stiffly
at
length
stella
gloved
hands
clasped
each
other
she
was
breathing
somewhat
hard
yet
her
bearing
was
wholly
regal
even
disdainful
only
because
i
realize
that
i
have
been
a
great
anxiety
to
all
the
respectable
portion
of
the
community
she
made
careless
reply
i
think
i
am
right
in
classing
you
under
that
heading
am
i
not
he
heard
the
challenge
in
her
tone
delicately
though
she
presented
it
and
something
in
him
that
was
fierce
and
unrestrained
sprang
up
to
meet
it
but
he
forced
it
back
his
expression
remained
wholly
inscrutable
i
do
think
i
can
claim
to
be
anything
else
he
said
but
that
fact
scarcely
makes
me
in
any
sense
one
of
a
community
i
think
i
prefer
to
stand
alone
her
blue
eyes
sparkled
a
little
strangely
i
have
the
same
preference
she
said
it
has
never
appealed
to
me
to
be
one
of
a
crowd
i
like
independence
whatever
the
crowd
may
say
but
i
am
quite
aware
that
in
a
woman
that
is
considered
a
dangerous
taste
a
woman
should
always
conform
to
rule
i
have
never
studied
the
subject
said
monck
he
spoke
briefly
tommy
confidences
had
stirred
within
him
that
which
could
not
be
expressed
the
whole
soul
of
him
shrank
with
an
almost
angry
repugnance
from
discussing
the
matter
with
her
no
discussion
could
make
any
difference
at
this
stage
again
for
a
second
he
saw
her
slight
frown
then
she
leaned
back
in
her
chair
stretching
up
her
arms
as
if
weary
of
the
matter
in
fact
you
avoid
all
things
feminine
she
said
how
discreet
of
you
a
large
white
moth
floated
suddenly
in
and
began
to
beat
itself
against
the
monck
eyes
watched
it
with
a
grim
concentration
stella
were
she
seemed
to
have
dismissed
him
from
her
mind
as
an
unimportant
detail
the
silence
widened
between
them
suddenly
there
was
a
movement
the
fluttering
creature
had
found
the
flame
and
fallen
dazed
upon
the
table
almost
in
the
same
second
monck
stooped
forward
swiftly
and
silently
and
crushed
the
thing
with
his
closed
fist
stella
drew
a
quick
breath
her
eyes
were
wide
open
again
she
sat
up
why
did
you
do
that
he
looked
at
her
again
a
smouldering
gleam
in
his
eyes
it
was
on
its
way
to
destruction
he
said
and
so
you
helped
it
he
nodded
yes
agonies
do
attract
me
stella
laughed
softly
yet
with
a
touch
of
mockery
oh
it
was
an
act
of
mercy
was
it
you
did
look
particularly
merciful
in
fact
that
is
about
the
last
quality
i
should
have
attributed
to
you
i
do
think
monck
said
very
quietly
that
you
are
in
a
position
to
judge
me
she
leaned
forward
he
saw
that
her
bosom
was
heaving
that
is
your
prerogative
is
it
she
said
i
i
am
just
the
prisoner
at
the
bar
and
like
the
moth
i
have
been
condemned
without
mercy
he
raised
his
brows
sharply
for
a
second
he
had
the
look
of
a
man
who
has
been
stabbed
in
the
back
then
with
a
swift
effort
he
pulled
himself
together
in
the
same
moment
stella
rose
she
was
smiling
and
there
was
a
red
flush
in
her
cheeks
she
took
her
fan
from
the
table
and
now
she
said
i
am
going
to
dance
all
night
long
every
officer
in
the
mess
save
one
has
asked
me
for
a
dance
he
was
on
his
feet
in
an
instant
he
had
checked
one
impulse
but
even
to
his
endurance
there
were
limits
he
spoke
as
one
goaded
will
you
give
me
one
she
looked
him
squarely
in
the
eyes
no
captain
monck
his
dark
face
looked
suddenly
stubborn
i
do
often
dance
he
said
i
was
going
to
dance
but
i
will
have
one
i
must
have
one
with
you
why
her
question
fell
with
a
crystal
clearness
there
was
something
of
crystal
hardness
in
her
eyes
but
the
man
was
undaunted
because
you
have
wronged
me
and
you
owe
me
reparation
i
have
wronged
you
she
spoke
the
words
slowly
still
looking
him
in
the
eyes
he
made
an
abrupt
gesture
as
of
holding
back
some
inner
force
that
strongly
urged
him
i
am
not
one
of
your
persecutors
he
said
i
have
never
in
my
life
presumed
to
judge
you
far
less
condemn
you
his
voice
vibrated
as
though
some
emotion
fought
fiercely
for
the
mastery
they
stood
facing
each
other
in
what
might
have
been
open
antagonism
but
for
that
deep
quiver
in
the
man
voice
stella
spoke
after
the
lapse
of
seconds
she
had
begun
to
tremble
then
why
why
did
you
let
me
think
so
why
did
you
always
stand
aloof
there
was
a
tremor
in
her
voice
also
but
her
eyes
were
shining
with
the
light
of
one
who
seeks
for
buried
treasure
monck
answer
was
pitched
very
low
it
was
as
if
the
soul
of
him
gave
utterance
to
the
words
it
is
my
nature
to
stand
aloof
i
was
waiting
waiting
her
two
hands
gripped
suddenly
hard
upon
her
fan
but
still
her
shining
eyes
did
not
flinch
from
his
still
with
a
quivering
heart
she
searched
almost
in
a
whisper
came
his
reply
i
was
waiting
till
my
turn
should
come
ah
the
fan
snapped
between
her
hands
she
cast
it
from
her
with
a
movement
that
was
almost
violent
monck
drew
back
sharply
with
a
smile
that
was
grimly
cynical
he
veiled
his
soul
i
was
a
fool
of
course
and
i
am
quite
aware
that
my
foolishness
is
nothing
to
you
but
at
least
you
know
now
how
little
cause
you
have
to
hate
me
she
had
turned
from
him
and
gone
to
the
open
window
she
stood
there
bending
slightly
forward
as
one
who
strains
for
a
last
glimpse
of
something
that
has
passed
from
sight
monck
remained
motionless
watching
her
from
another
room
near
by
there
came
the
sound
of
tommy
humming
and
the
cheery
pop
of
a
withdrawn
cork
stella
spoke
at
last
in
a
whisper
and
as
she
spoke
the
strain
went
out
of
her
attitude
and
she
drooped
against
the
of
the
window
as
if
spent
yes
but
i
know
too
late
the
words
reached
him
though
he
scarcely
felt
that
they
were
intended
to
do
so
he
suffered
them
to
go
into
silence
the
time
for
speech
was
past
the
seconds
throbbed
away
between
them
stella
did
not
move
or
speak
again
and
at
last
monck
turned
from
her
he
picked
up
the
broken
fan
and
with
a
curious
reverence
he
laid
it
out
of
sight
among
some
books
on
the
table
then
he
stood
immovable
as
granite
and
waited
there
came
the
sound
of
tommy
footsteps
and
in
a
moment
the
door
was
flung
open
tommy
advanced
with
all
a
host
solicitude
oh
i
say
i
awfully
sorry
to
have
kept
you
waiting
so
long
that
silly
ass
of
a
had
cleared
off
and
left
us
nothing
to
drink
stella
we
shall
miss
all
the
fun
if
we
do
hurry
up
come
on
monck
old
chap
say
when
he
stopped
at
the
table
and
stella
turned
from
the
window
and
moved
forward
her
face
was
pale
but
she
was
smiling
captain
monck
is
coming
with
us
tommy
she
said
what
tommy
looked
up
sharply
really
i
say
monck
i
pleased
it
do
you
good
monck
was
smiling
also
faintly
grimly
do
mix
any
strong
waters
for
me
tommy
he
said
and
you
had
better
not
be
too
generous
to
yourself
remember
you
will
have
to
dance
with
lady
harriet
tommy
grimaced
above
the
glasses
all
right
have
some
you
will
have
to
dance
with
her
too
that
some
consolation
i
said
monck
he
took
the
glass
and
handed
it
to
stella
then
as
she
shook
her
head
he
put
it
to
his
own
lips
and
drank
as
a
man
drinks
to
a
memory
no
he
said
then
i
am
dancing
only
one
dance
and
that
will
not
be
with
lady
harriet
mansfield
who
then
questioned
tommy
it
was
stella
who
answered
him
in
her
voice
a
note
that
sounded
it
is
given
to
every
woman
to
dance
at
her
own
funeral
she
said
captain
monck
has
kindly
consented
to
assist
at
the
orgy
of
mine
stella
protested
tommy
flushing
i
hate
to
hear
you
talking
like
that
stella
laughed
a
little
softly
as
though
at
the
vagaries
of
a
child
poor
tommy
she
said
what
it
is
to
be
so
young
i
sooner
be
a
babe
in
arms
than
a
cynic
said
tommy
bluntly
chapter
iii
the
triumph
lady
harriet
lorgnettes
were
brought
piercingly
to
bear
upon
the
that
night
and
her
thin
refined
features
never
relaxed
during
the
operation
she
was
looking
upon
such
youth
and
loveliness
as
seldom
came
her
way
but
the
sight
gave
her
no
pleasure
she
deemed
it
extremely
unsuitable
that
stella
should
dance
at
all
on
the
eve
of
her
wedding
and
when
she
realized
that
nearly
every
man
in
the
room
was
having
his
turn
her
disapproval
by
no
means
diminished
she
wondered
audibly
to
one
after
another
of
her
followers
what
captain
dacre
was
about
to
permit
such
a
thing
and
when
monck
everard
monck
of
all
people
who
usually
avoided
all
gatherings
at
the
club
and
had
never
been
known
to
dance
if
he
could
find
any
legitimate
means
of
excusing
himself
waltzed
stella
through
the
throng
her
indignation
amounted
almost
to
anger
the
mess
had
yielded
to
the
last
man
i
call
it
almost
brazen
she
said
to
burton
the
major
wife
she
flaunts
her
unconventionality
in
our
faces
a
grave
mistake
agreed
burton
it
will
not
make
us
think
any
the
more
highly
of
her
when
she
is
married
i
am
in
two
minds
about
calling
on
her
declared
lady
harriet
i
am
very
doubtful
as
to
the
advisability
of
inviting
any
one
so
obviously
unsuitable
into
our
inner
circle
of
course
ralston
she
raised
her
long
pointed
chin
upon
the
name
will
please
herself
in
the
matter
she
will
probably
be
the
first
to
try
and
draw
her
in
but
what
ralston
does
and
what
i
do
are
two
very
different
things
she
is
not
particular
as
to
the
society
she
keeps
and
the
result
is
that
her
opinion
is
very
justly
regarded
as
worthless
oh
quite
agreed
burton
sending
an
obviously
false
smile
in
the
direction
of
the
lady
last
named
who
was
approaching
them
in
the
company
of
ermsted
the
adjutant
wife
a
little
smart
woman
whom
tommy
had
long
since
surnamed
the
lizard
ralston
the
surgeon
wife
had
once
been
a
pretty
girl
and
there
were
occasions
still
on
which
her
prettiness
lingered
like
the
gleams
of
a
fading
sunset
she
had
a
diffident
manner
in
society
but
yet
she
was
the
only
woman
in
the
station
who
refused
to
follow
lady
harriet
lead
as
tommy
had
said
she
was
a
nobody
her
influence
was
of
no
account
but
yet
with
unobtrusive
insistence
she
took
her
own
way
and
none
could
turn
her
therefrom
ermsted
held
her
up
to
ridicule
openly
and
yet
very
strangely
she
did
not
seem
to
dislike
the
adjutant
little
wife
she
had
been
very
good
to
her
on
more
than
one
occasion
and
the
most
appreciative
remark
that
ermsted
had
ever
found
to
make
regarding
her
was
that
the
poor
thing
was
so
fond
of
drudging
for
somebody
that
it
was
a
real
kindness
to
let
her
ermsted
was
quite
willing
to
be
kind
to
any
one
in
that
respect
they
approached
now
and
lady
harriet
gave
to
each
her
distinctive
smile
of
royal
condescension
i
expected
to
see
you
dancing
ermsted
she
said
oh
it
too
hot
declared
ermsted
you
want
the
temperament
of
a
salamander
to
dance
on
a
night
like
this
she
cast
a
barbed
glance
towards
stella
as
she
spoke
as
monck
guided
her
to
the
least
crowded
corner
of
the
stella
delicate
face
was
flushed
but
it
was
the
exquisite
flush
of
a
her
eyes
were
of
a
starry
brightness
she
had
the
radiant
look
of
one
who
has
achieved
her
heart
desire
what
a
vision
of
triumph
commented
ermsted
it
soothing
anyway
to
know
that
that
complexion
wo
survive
the
summer
captain
monck
looks
curiously
out
of
his
element
no
doubt
he
prefers
the
bazaars
but
stella
denvers
is
enchanting
murmured
ralston
lady
harriet
overheard
the
murmur
and
her
aquiline
nose
was
instantly
elevated
a
little
higher
so
many
people
never
see
beyond
the
outer
husk
she
said
burton
smiled
out
of
her
slitty
eyes
i
should
scarcely
imagine
captain
monck
to
be
one
of
them
she
said
he
is
obviously
here
as
a
matter
of
form
the
best
man
must
be
civil
to
the
bride
whatever
his
feelings
lady
harriet
face
cleared
a
little
although
her
estimate
of
burton
opinion
was
not
a
very
high
one
that
may
account
for
captain
dacre
extremely
complacent
attitude
she
said
he
regards
the
attentions
paid
to
his
as
a
tribute
to
himself
he
may
change
his
point
of
view
when
he
is
married
laughed
ermsted
it
will
be
interesting
to
watch
developments
we
all
know
what
captain
dacre
is
i
have
never
yet
seen
him
satisfied
to
take
a
back
seat
burton
laughed
with
her
nor
content
to
occupy
even
a
front
one
at
the
same
show
for
long
she
observed
i
marvel
to
see
him
caught
in
the
noose
so
easily
none
but
an
adventuress
could
have
done
it
declared
ermsted
she
has
practised
the
art
of
slinging
the
lasso
before
now
my
dear
said
ralston
forgive
me
but
that
is
unworthy
of
you
ermsted
flicked
an
eyelid
in
burton
direction
with
an
that
somehow
robbed
the
act
of
any
serious
sting
poor
ralston
holds
such
a
high
opinion
of
everybody
she
said
that
she
must
meet
with
a
hundred
disappointments
in
a
day
lady
harriet
lips
said
nothing
but
they
were
none
the
less
eloquent
on
that
account
ralston
eyes
of
faded
blue
watched
stella
with
a
distressed
look
she
was
not
hurt
on
her
own
account
but
she
hated
to
hear
the
girl
criticized
in
so
unfriendly
a
spirit
stella
was
more
brilliantly
beautiful
that
night
than
she
had
ever
before
seen
her
and
she
longed
to
hear
a
word
of
appreciation
from
that
hostile
group
of
women
but
she
knew
very
well
that
the
longing
was
vain
and
it
was
with
relief
that
she
saw
captain
dacre
himself
saunter
up
to
claim
ermsted
for
a
partner
smiling
debonair
complacent
the
morrow
bridegroom
had
a
careless
quip
for
all
and
sundry
on
that
last
night
it
was
evident
that
his
defection
was
a
matter
of
no
moment
to
him
stella
was
to
have
her
fling
and
he
it
seemed
meant
to
have
his
he
and
ermsted
had
had
many
a
flirtation
in
the
days
that
were
past
and
it
was
well
known
that
captain
ermsted
heartily
detested
him
in
consequence
some
even
hinted
that
matters
had
at
one
time
approached
very
near
to
a
climax
but
ralph
dacre
knew
how
to
handle
difficult
situations
and
with
considerable
tact
had
managed
to
avoid
it
little
ermsted
though
still
willing
to
flirt
treated
him
with
just
a
tinge
of
disdain
no
one
knew
wherefore
perhaps
it
was
more
for
stella
edification
than
her
own
that
she
condescended
to
dance
with
him
on
that
sweltering
evening
of
indian
spring
but
stella
was
evidently
too
engrossed
with
her
own
affairs
to
pay
much
attention
to
the
doings
of
her
his
was
not
of
a
nature
to
be
carried
on
in
public
that
would
come
later
when
they
walked
home
through
the
glittering
night
and
parted
in
the
shadowy
verandah
while
tommy
tramped
restlessly
about
within
the
bungalow
he
would
claim
that
as
a
right
she
knew
and
once
or
twice
remembering
the
methods
of
his
courtship
a
little
shudder
went
through
her
as
she
danced
very
willingly
would
she
have
left
early
and
foregone
all
intercourse
with
her
lover
that
night
but
there
was
no
escape
for
her
she
was
pledged
to
the
last
dance
and
for
the
sake
of
the
pride
that
she
carried
so
high
she
would
not
shrink
under
the
malicious
eyes
that
watched
her
so
unsparingly
her
dance
with
monck
was
quickly
over
and
he
left
her
with
the
briefest
word
of
thanks
afterwards
she
saw
him
no
more
the
rest
of
the
evening
passed
in
a
whirl
of
gaiety
that
meant
very
little
to
her
perhaps
on
the
whole
it
was
easier
to
bear
than
an
evening
spent
in
solitude
would
have
been
she
knew
that
she
would
be
too
utterly
weary
to
lie
awake
when
bedtime
came
at
last
and
the
night
would
be
so
short
ah
so
short
and
so
she
danced
and
laughed
with
the
gayest
of
the
merrymakers
and
when
it
was
over
at
last
even
the
severest
of
her
critics
had
to
admit
that
her
triumph
was
complete
she
had
borne
herself
like
a
queen
at
a
banquet
of
rejoicing
and
like
a
queen
she
finally
quitted
the
festive
scene
in
a
drawn
by
a
team
of
giddy
subalterns
scattering
her
careless
favours
upon
all
who
cared
to
compete
for
them
as
she
had
foreseen
dacre
accompanied
the
procession
he
had
no
mind
to
be
cheated
of
his
rights
and
it
was
he
who
finally
dispersed
the
irresponsible
throng
at
the
steps
of
the
verandah
handing
her
up
them
with
a
royal
air
and
drawing
her
away
from
the
laughter
and
cheering
that
followed
her
with
her
hand
pressed
lightly
against
his
side
he
led
her
away
to
the
darkest
corner
and
there
he
pushed
back
the
soft
wrap
from
her
shoulders
and
gathered
her
into
his
arms
she
stood
almost
stiffly
in
his
embrace
neither
yielding
nor
attempting
to
avoid
but
at
the
touch
of
his
lips
upon
her
neck
she
shivered
there
was
something
sensual
in
that
touch
that
revolted
her
in
spite
of
herself
ralph
she
said
and
her
voice
quivered
a
little
i
think
you
must
say
to
me
i
am
tired
if
i
do
rest
i
shall
never
be
ready
for
he
made
an
inarticulate
sound
that
in
some
fashion
expressed
what
the
drawing
of
his
lips
had
made
her
feel
sweetheart
he
said
and
kissed
her
again
with
a
lingering
persistence
that
to
her
overwrought
nerves
had
in
it
something
that
was
almost
unendurable
it
made
her
think
of
an
epicurean
tasting
some
favourite
dish
and
smacking
his
lips
over
it
a
hint
of
irritation
sounded
in
her
voice
as
she
said
drawing
slightly
away
from
him
yes
i
want
to
rest
for
the
few
hours
that
are
left
please
say
good
night
now
ralph
really
i
am
tired
he
laughed
softly
his
cheek
laid
to
hers
ah
stella
he
said
what
a
queen
you
have
been
i
have
been
watching
you
with
the
rest
of
the
world
and
i
should
mind
laying
pretty
heavy
odds
that
there
is
a
single
man
among
that
does
envy
me
stella
drew
a
deep
breath
as
if
she
laboured
against
some
oppression
it
nice
to
be
envied
is
it
she
said
he
kissed
her
again
ah
you
a
prize
he
said
it
was
just
a
question
of
first
in
and
i
never
was
one
to
let
the
grass
grow
i
plucked
the
fruit
while
all
the
rest
were
just
looking
at
it
stella
mine
stella
mine
his
lips
pressed
hers
between
the
words
closely
possessively
and
again
involuntarily
she
shivered
she
could
not
return
his
caresses
that
night
his
hold
relaxed
at
last
how
cold
you
are
my
star
of
the
north
he
said
what
is
it
surely
you
are
not
nervous
at
the
thought
of
after
your
triumph
you
will
carry
all
before
you
never
fear
she
answered
him
in
a
voice
so
flat
and
emotionless
that
it
sounded
foreign
even
to
herself
oh
no
i
am
not
nervous
i
too
tired
to
feel
anything
he
took
her
face
between
his
hands
ah
well
you
will
be
all
mine
this
time
one
kiss
and
i
will
let
you
go
you
witch
you
enchantress
i
never
thought
you
would
draw
old
monck
too
into
your
toils
again
she
drew
that
deep
breath
as
of
one
borne
down
by
some
heavy
weight
nor
i
she
said
and
gave
him
wearily
the
kiss
for
which
he
bargained
he
did
not
stay
much
longer
possibly
realizing
his
inability
to
awake
any
genuine
response
in
her
that
night
her
remoteness
must
have
chilled
any
man
less
ardent
but
he
went
from
her
too
encompassed
with
blissful
anticipation
to
attach
any
importance
to
the
obvious
lack
of
corresponding
delight
on
her
part
she
was
already
in
his
estimation
his
own
property
and
the
thought
of
her
happiness
was
one
which
scarcely
entered
into
his
consideration
she
had
accepted
him
and
no
doubt
she
realized
that
she
was
doing
very
well
for
herself
he
had
no
misgivings
on
that
point
stella
was
a
young
woman
who
knew
her
own
mind
very
thoroughly
she
had
secured
the
finest
catch
within
reach
and
she
was
not
likely
to
repent
of
her
bargain
at
this
stage
so
unconcernedly
he
went
his
way
throwing
a
couple
of
with
careless
generosity
to
a
beggar
who
followed
him
along
the
road
whining
for
alms
with
himself
and
with
all
the
world
on
that
wonderful
night
that
had
witnessed
the
final
triumph
of
the
woman
whom
he
had
chosen
for
his
bride
asking
nought
of
the
gods
save
that
which
they
had
deigned
to

chapter
iv
the
bride
it
was
remarked
by
tommy
on
the
following
day
that
it
was
he
rather
than
the
bride
who
displayed
all
the
shyness
that
befitted
the
occasion
as
he
walked
up
the
aisle
with
his
sister
hand
on
his
arm
his
face
was
crimson
and
reluctant
and
he
stared
straight
before
him
as
if
unwilling
to
meet
all
the
watching
eyes
that
followed
their
progress
but
the
bride
walked
proudly
and
firmly
her
head
held
high
with
even
the
suspicion
of
an
upward
disdainful
curve
to
her
beautiful
mouth
the
ghost
of
a
defiant
smile
to
all
who
saw
her
she
was
a
splendid
spectacle
of
bridal
content
unparalleled
effrontery
whispered
lady
harriet
surveying
the
proud
young
face
through
her
lorgnettes
ah
but
she
is
exquisite
murmured
ralston
with
a
wistful
mist
in
her
faded
eyes
faultless
icily
regular
splendidly
null
scoffed
little
ermsted
upon
whose
cheeks
there
bloomed
a
faint
fixed
glow
yes
she
was
splendid
even
the
most
hostile
had
to
admit
it
on
that
the
day
of
her
final
victory
she
surpassed
herself
she
shone
as
a
queen
with
majestic
wholly
at
her
ease
sublimely
indifferent
to
all
criticism
at
the
she
bestowed
a
brief
smile
of
greeting
upon
her
waiting
bridegroom
and
for
a
single
moment
her
steady
eyes
rested
though
without
any
gleam
of
recognition
upon
the
dark
face
of
the
best
man
then
the
service
began
and
with
the
utmost
calmness
of
demeanour
she
took
her
part
when
the
service
was
over
tommy
extended
his
hesitating
invitation
to
lady
harriet
and
his
commanding
officer
to
follow
the
newly
wedded
pair
to
the
vestry
they
went
colonel
mansfield
with
a
species
of
jocose
pomposity
specially
assumed
for
the
occasion
his
wife
upright
forbidding
instinct
with
wordless
disapproval
the
bride
the
veil
thrown
back
from
her
beautiful
face
stood
laughing
with
her
husband
there
was
no
fixity
in
the
soft
flush
of
those
delicately
rounded
cheeks
even
lady
harriet
realized
that
though
she
had
never
seen
so
much
colour
in
the
girl
face
before
she
advanced
stiffly
and
ralph
dacre
with
smiling
grace
took
his
wife
arm
and
drew
her
forward
this
is
good
of
you
lady
harriet
he
declared
i
was
hoping
for
your
support
allow
me
to
introduce
my
wife
his
words
had
a
pride
of
possession
that
rang
in
every
syllable
and
in
response
lady
harriet
was
moved
to
offer
a
cold
cheek
in
salutation
to
the
bride
stella
bent
instantly
and
kissed
it
with
a
quick
graciousness
that
would
have
melted
any
one
less
austere
but
in
lady
harriet
opinion
the
act
was
marred
by
its
very
impulsiveness
she
did
not
like
impulsive
people
so
with
chill
repression
she
accepted
the
only
overture
from
stella
that
she
was
ever
to
receive
but
if
she
were
proof
against
the
girl
ready
charm
with
her
husband
it
was
quite
otherwise
stella
broke
through
his
pomposity
without
effort
giving
him
both
her
hands
with
a
simplicity
that
went
straight
to
his
heart
he
held
them
in
a
tight
paternal
grasp
god
bless
you
my
dear
he
said
i
wish
you
both
every
happiness
from
the
bottom
of
my
soul
she
turned
from
him
a
few
seconds
later
with
a
faintly
tremulous
laugh
to
give
her
hand
to
the
best
man
but
it
did
not
linger
in
his
and
to
his
curtly
proffered
felicitations
she
made
no
verbal
response
whatever
ten
minutes
later
as
she
left
the
vestry
with
her
husband
ralston
pressed
forward
unexpectedly
and
openly
checked
her
progress
in
full
view
of
the
whole
assembly
my
dear
she
murmured
humbly
my
dear
you
allow
me
i
know
i
wanted
just
to
tell
you
how
beautiful
you
look
and
how
earnestly
i
pray
for
your
happiness
it
was
a
daring
move
and
it
had
not
been
accomplished
without
courage
lady
harriet
in
the
background
stiffened
with
displeasure
nearer
to
actual
anger
than
she
had
ever
before
permitted
herself
to
be
with
any
one
so
contemptible
as
the
surgeon
wife
even
major
ralston
himself
most
phlegmatic
of
men
looked
momentarily
disconcerted
by
his
action
but
stella
stella
stopped
dead
with
a
new
light
in
her
eyes
and
in
a
moment
dropped
her
husband
arm
to
fling
both
her
own
about
the
gentle
faded
woman
who
had
dared
thus
openly
to
range
herself
on
her
side
dear
ralston
she
said
not
very
steadily
how
more
than
kind
of
you
to
tell
me
that
the
tears
were
actually
in
her
eyes
as
she
kissed
the
surgeon
wife
that
spontaneous
act
of
sympathy
had
pierced
straight
through
her
armour
of
reserve
and
found
its
way
to
her
heart
her
face
as
she
passed
on
down
the
aisle
by
her
husband
side
was
wonderfully
softened
and
even
ermsted
found
no
gibe
to
fling
after
her
the
smile
that
quivered
on
stella
lips
was
full
of
an
unconscious
pathos
that
disarmed
all
criticism
the
sunshine
outside
the
church
was
blinding
it
smote
through
the
awning
with
pitiless
intensity
around
the
carriage
a
curious
crowd
had
gathered
to
see
the
bridal
procession
to
stella
dazzled
eyes
it
seemed
a
surging
sea
of
unfamiliar
faces
but
one
face
stood
out
from
the
rest
the
calm
countenance
of
ralph
dacre
magnificent
sikh
servant
clad
in
snowy
linen
who
stood
at
the
carriage
door
and
gravely
bowed
himself
before
her
stretching
an
arm
to
protect
her
dress
from
the
wheel
this
is
peter
the
great
said
dacre
careless
voice
a
highly
honourable
person
stella
and
a
most
efficient
bodyguard
how
do
you
do
said
stella
and
held
out
her
hand
she
acted
with
the
utmost
simplicity
during
her
four
weeks
sojourn
in
india
she
had
not
learned
to
treat
the
native
servant
with
contempt
and
the
majestic
presence
of
this
man
made
her
feel
almost
as
if
she
were
dealing
with
a
prince
he
straightened
himself
swiftly
at
her
action
and
she
saw
a
sudden
gleaming
smile
flash
across
his
grave
face
then
he
took
the
proffered
hand
bending
low
over
it
till
his
turbaned
forehead
for
a
moment
touched
her
fingers
may
the
sun
always
shine
on
you
my
he
said
stella
realized
afterwards
that
in
action
and
in
words
there
lay
a
tacit
acceptance
of
her
as
mistress
which
was
to
become
the
allegiance
of
a
lifelong
service
she
stepped
into
the
carriage
with
a
feeling
of
warmth
at
her
heart
which
was
very
different
from
the
icy
constriction
that
had
bound
it
when
she
had
arrived
at
the
church
a
brief
before
with
tommy
her
husband
arm
was
about
her
as
they
drove
away
he
pressed
her
to
his
side
oh
star
of
my
heart
how
superb
you
are
he
said
i
feel
as
if
i
had
married
a
queen
and
you
were
even
nervous
she
bent
her
head
not
looking
at
him
poor
tommy
was
she
said
he
smiled
tolerantly
tommy
such
a
youngster
she
smiled
also
exactly
one
year
younger
than
i
am
he
drew
her
nearer
his
eyes
devouring
her
you
stella
he
said
you
are
as
ageless
as
the
stars
she
laughed
faintly
not
yielding
herself
to
the
closer
pressure
though
not
actually
resisting
it
that
is
merely
a
form
of
telling
me
that
i
am
much
older
than
i
seem
she
said
and
you
are
quite
right
i
am
his
arm
compelled
her
you
are
you
he
said
and
you
are
so
divinely
young
and
beautiful
that
there
is
no
measuring
you
by
ordinary
standards
they
all
know
it
that
is
why
you
were
received
into
the
community
with
open
arms
you
are
utterly
above
and
beyond
them
all
she
flinched
slightly
at
the
allusion
i
hope
i
am
not
so
extraordinary
as
all
that
she
said
his
arm
became
insistent
you
are
unique
he
said
you
are
superb
there
was
passion
barely
suppressed
in
his
hold
and
a
sudden
swift
shiver
went
through
her
oh
ralph
she
said
do
do
worship
me
too
much
her
voice
quivered
in
its
appeal
but
somehow
its
pathos
passed
him
by
he
saw
only
her
beauty
and
it
thrilled
every
pulse
in
his
body
fiercely
almost
he
strained
her
to
him
and
he
did
not
so
much
as
notice
that
her
lips
trembled
too
piteously
to
return
his
kiss
or
that
her
submission
to
his
embrace
was
eloquent
of
mute
endurance
rather
than
glad
surrender
he
stood
as
a
conqueror
on
the
threshold
of
a
newly
acquired
kingdom
and
exulted
over
the
splendour
of
its
treasures
because
it
was
all
his
own
it
did
not
even
occur
to
him
to
doubt
that
her
happiness
fully
equalled
his
stella
was
a
woman
and
reserved
but
she
was
happy
enough
oh
she
was
happy
enough
with
complacence
he
reflected
that
if
every
man
in
the
mess
envied
him
probably
every
woman
in
the
station
would
have
gladly
changed
places
with
her
was
he
not
fortune
favourite
what
happier
fate
could
any
woman
desire
than
to
be
his
bride
chapter
v
the
dream
it
was
a
fortnight
after
the
wedding
on
an
evening
of
intense
heat
that
everard
monck
now
established
with
tommy
at
the
green
bungalow
came
in
from
polo
to
find
the
mail
awaiting
him
he
sauntered
in
through
the
verandah
in
search
of
a
drink
which
he
expected
to
find
in
the
room
which
stella
during
her
brief
sojourn
had
made
more
dainty
and
artistic
than
the
rest
albeit
it
had
never
been
dignified
by
the
name
of
there
was
light
green
matting
on
the
floor
and
there
were
also
light
green
cushions
in
each
of
the
long
wicker
chairs
curtains
of
green
gauze
hung
before
the
windows
and
the
fierce
sunlight
filtering
through
gave
the
room
a
strangely
translucent
effect
it
was
like
a
chamber
under
the
sea
it
had
been
monck
intention
to
have
his
drink
and
pass
straight
on
to
his
own
quarters
for
a
bath
but
the
letters
on
the
table
caught
his
eye
and
he
stopped
standing
in
the
green
dimness
with
a
tumbler
in
one
hand
he
sorted
them
out
there
were
two
for
himself
and
two
for
tommy
the
latter
obviously
bills
and
under
these
one
more
also
for
tommy
in
a
woman
clear
round
writing
it
came
from
srinagar
and
monck
stood
for
a
second
or
two
holding
it
in
his
hand
and
staring
straight
out
before
him
with
eyes
that
saw
not
just
for
those
seconds
a
mocking
vision
danced
gnomelike
through
his
brain
just
at
this
moment
probably
most
of
the
other
men
were
opening
letters
from
their
wives
in
the
hills
and
he
saw
the
chance
he
had
not
taken
like
a
flash
of
far
elusive
sunlight
on
the
of
a
troubled
sea
the
vision
passed
he
laid
down
the
letter
and
took
up
his
own
correspondence
one
of
the
letters
was
from
england
he
poured
out
his
drink
and
flung
himself
down
to
read
it
it
came
from
the
only
relation
he
possessed
in
the
world
his
brother
bernard
monck
was
the
elder
by
fifteen
years
a
man
of
brilliant
capabilities
who
had
long
since
relinquished
all
idea
of
worldly
advancement
in
the
interest
of
a
prison
chaplaincy
they
had
not
met
for
over
five
years
but
they
maintained
a
regular
correspondence
and
every
month
brought
to
everard
monck
the
thin
envelope
directed
in
the
square
purposeful
handwriting
of
the
man
who
had
been
during
the
whole
of
his
life
his
nearest
and
best
friend
lying
back
in
the
relaxed
and
weary
he
opened
the
letter
and
began
to
read
ten
minutes
later
tommy
denvers
racing
in
also
in
stopped
short
upon
the
threshold
and
stared
in
shocked
amazement
as
if
some
sudden
horror
had
caught
him
by
the
throat
great
heavens
above
monck
what
the
matter
he
ejaculated
perhaps
it
was
in
part
due
to
the
green
twilight
of
the
room
but
it
seemed
to
him
in
that
first
startled
moment
that
monck
face
had
the
look
of
a
man
who
had
received
a
deadly
wound
the
impression
passed
almost
immediately
but
the
memory
of
it
was
registered
in
his
brain
for
all
time
monck
raised
the
tumbler
to
his
lips
and
drank
before
replying
and
as
he
did
so
his
customary
grave
composure
became
apparent
making
tommy
wonder
if
his
senses
had
tricked
him
he
looked
at
the
lad
with
sombre
eyes
as
he
set
down
the
glass
his
brother
letter
was
still
gripped
in
his
hand
hullo
tommy
he
said
a
shadowy
smile
about
his
mouth
what
are
you
in
such
a
deuce
of
a
hurry
about
tommy
glanced
down
at
the
letters
on
the
table
and
pounced
upon
the
one
that
lay
uppermost
a
letter
from
stella
and
about
time
too
she
is
much
of
a
correspondent
where
are
they
now
oh
srinagar
lucky
beggar
dacre
wish
he
taken
me
along
as
well
as
stella
what
am
i
in
such
a
hurry
about
well
my
dear
chap
look
at
the
time
you
be
late
for
mess
yourself
if
you
do
buck
up
tommy
treatment
of
his
captain
was
ever
of
the
airiest
when
they
were
alone
he
had
never
stood
in
awe
of
monck
since
the
days
of
his
illness
but
even
in
his
most
familiar
moments
his
manner
was
not
without
a
certain
deference
his
respect
for
him
was
unbounded
and
his
pride
in
their
intimacy
was
boyishly
there
was
no
sacrifice
great
or
small
that
he
would
not
willingly
have
offered
at
monck
behest
and
monck
knew
it
realized
the
lad
devotion
as
pure
gold
and
valued
it
accordingly
but
that
fact
notwithstanding
his
faith
in
discretion
did
not
move
him
to
bestow
his
unreserved
confidence
upon
him
probably
to
no
man
in
the
world
could
he
have
opened
his
secret
soul
he
was
not
of
an
expansive
nature
but
tommy
occupied
an
inner
place
in
his
regard
and
there
were
some
things
that
he
veiled
from
all
beside
which
he
no
longer
attempted
to
hide
from
this
faithful
follower
of
his
thus
far
was
tommy
privileged
he
got
to
his
feet
in
response
to
the
boy
last
remark
yes
right
we
ought
to
be
going
i
shall
be
interested
to
hear
what
your
sister
thinks
of
kashmir
i
went
up
there
on
a
shooting
expedition
two
years
after
i
came
out
it
a
fine
country
is
there
anywhere
that
you
have
been
said
tommy
i
believe
write
a
book
one
of
these
days
monck
looked
ironical
not
till
i
on
the
shelf
tommy
he
said
where
there
nothing
better
to
do
you
never
be
on
the
shelf
said
tommy
quickly
you
be
much
too
valuable
monck
shrugged
his
shoulders
slightly
and
turned
to
go
i
doubt
if
that
consideration
would
occur
to
any
one
but
you
my
boy
he
said
they
walked
to
the
together
a
little
later
through
the
airless
dark
and
there
was
nothing
in
monck
manner
either
then
or
during
the
evening
to
confirm
the
doubt
in
tommy
mind
spirits
were
not
very
high
at
the
mess
just
then
nearly
all
the
women
had
left
for
the
hills
and
the
increasing
heat
was
beginning
to
make
life
a
burden
the
younger
officers
did
their
best
to
be
cheerful
and
one
of
them
bertie
oakes
a
merry
brainless
youngster
even
proposed
an
impromptu
dance
to
enliven
the
proceedings
but
he
did
not
find
many
supporters
men
were
tired
after
the
polo
colonel
mansfield
and
major
burton
were
deeply
engrossed
with
some
news
that
had
been
brought
by
barnes
of
the
police
and
no
one
mustered
energy
for
more
than
talk
tommy
soon
decided
to
leave
early
and
return
to
his
letters
before
departing
he
looked
round
for
monck
as
was
his
custom
but
finding
that
he
and
captain
ermsted
had
also
been
drawn
into
the
discussion
with
the
colonel
he
left
the
mess
alone
back
in
the
green
bungalow
he
flung
off
his
coat
and
threw
himself
down
in
his
on
the
verandah
to
read
his
sister
letter
the
light
from
the
lamp
streamed
across
the
pages
stella
had
written
very
fully
of
their
wanderings
but
her
companion
she
scarcely
mentioned
it
was
like
a
gorgeous
dream
she
said
each
day
seemed
to
bring
greater
beauties
they
had
spent
the
first
two
at
agra
to
see
the
wonderful
taj
which
of
course
was
wholly
beyond
description
thence
they
had
made
their
way
to
rawal
pindi
where
ralph
had
several
military
friends
to
be
introduced
to
his
bride
it
was
evident
that
he
was
anxious
to
display
his
new
possession
and
tommy
frowned
a
little
over
that
episode
realizing
fully
why
stella
touched
so
lightly
upon
it
for
some
reason
his
dislike
of
dacre
was
increasing
rapidly
and
he
read
the
letter
very
critically
it
was
the
first
with
any
detail
that
she
had
written
from
rawal
pindi
they
had
journeyed
on
to
exquisite
murree
set
in
the
midst
of
the
pines
where
only
to
breathe
was
the
keenest
pleasure
stella
spoke
almost
wistfully
of
this
place
she
would
have
loved
to
linger
there
i
could
be
happy
there
in
perfect
solitude
she
wrote
with
just
peter
the
great
to
take
care
of
me
she
mentioned
the
sikh
bearer
more
than
once
and
each
time
with
growing
affection
he
is
like
an
immense
and
kindly
she
said
in
one
place
every
material
comfort
that
i
could
possibly
wish
for
he
manages
somehow
to
procure
and
he
is
always
on
guard
always
there
when
wanted
yet
never
in
the
way
their
time
being
limited
and
ralph
anxious
to
use
it
to
the
utmost
they
had
left
murree
after
a
very
brief
stay
and
pressed
on
into
kashmir
travelling
in
a
through
the
most
glorious
scenery
that
stella
had
ever
beheld
i
only
wished
you
could
have
been
there
to
enjoy
it
with
me
she
wrote
and
passed
on
to
a
glowing
description
of
the
hills
amidst
which
they
had
travelled
all
grandly
beautiful
and
many
capped
with
the
eternal
snows
she
told
of
the
river
jhelum
swift
and
splendid
that
flowed
beside
the
way
of
the
flowers
that
bloomed
in
dazzling
profusion
on
every
side
wild
roses
such
as
she
had
never
dreamed
of
purple
acacias
jessamine
yellow
and
white
ferns
that
hung
in
sprays
of
living
green
over
the
rushing
waterfalls
and
the
vivid
scarlet
pomegranate
blossom
that
grew
like
a
spreading
fire
and
the
air
that
blew
through
the
mountains
was
as
the
very
breath
of
life
physically
she
declared
she
had
never
felt
so
well
but
she
did
not
speak
of
happiness
and
again
tommy
brow
contracted
as
he
read
for
all
its
enthusiasm
there
was
to
him
something
wanting
in
that
letter
a
lack
that
hurt
him
subtly
why
did
she
say
so
little
of
her
companion
in
the
wilderness
no
casual
reader
would
have
dreamed
that
the
narrative
had
been
written
by
a
bride
upon
her
honeymoon
he
read
on
read
of
their
journey
up
the
river
to
srinagar
punted
by
native
boatmen
and
again
as
she
spoke
of
their
sad
droning
chant
she
compared
it
all
to
a
dream
i
wonder
if
i
am
really
asleep
tommy
she
wrote
if
i
shall
wake
up
in
the
middle
of
a
dark
night
and
find
that
i
have
never
left
england
after
all
that
is
what
i
feel
like
sometimes
almost
as
if
life
had
been
suspended
for
awhile
this
strange
existence
can
not
be
real
i
am
sure
that
at
the
heart
of
me
i
must
be
asleep
at
srinagar
a
native
had
been
in
progress
and
the
howling
of
men
and
din
of
had
somewhat
marred
the
harmony
of
their
arrival
but
it
was
all
interesting
like
an
absorbing
she
said
but
quite
unreal
she
felt
sure
it
could
be
true
ralph
had
been
disgusted
with
the
hubbub
and
confusion
he
compared
the
place
to
an
asylum
of
filthy
lunatics
and
they
had
left
it
without
delay
and
so
at
last
they
had
come
to
their
present
in
the
heart
of
the
wilderness
with
coolies
and
tents
and
were
camped
beside
a
rushing
stream
that
filled
the
air
with
its
crystal
music
day
and
night
and
this
is
heaven
wrote
stella
but
it
is
the
heaven
of
the
orient
and
i
am
not
sure
that
i
have
any
part
or
lot
in
it
i
believe
i
shall
feel
myself
an
interloper
for
all
time
i
dread
to
turn
each
corner
lest
i
should
meet
the
angel
with
the
flaming
sword
and
be
driven
forth
into
the
desert
if
only
you
were
here
tommy
it
would
be
more
real
to
me
but
ralph
is
just
a
part
of
the
dream
he
is
almost
like
an
eastern
potentate
himself
with
his
endless
cigarettes
and
his
wonderful
capacity
for
doing
nothing
all
day
long
without
being
bored
of
course
i
am
not
bored
but
then
no
one
ever
feels
bored
in
a
dream
the
lazy
of
it
all
has
the
effect
of
a
narcotic
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
can
not
imagine
ever
feeling
active
in
this
lulling
atmosphere
perhaps
there
is
too
much
champagne
in
the
air
and
i
am
never
wholly
sober
perhaps
it
is
only
in
the
desert
that
any
one
ever
lives
to
the
utmost
the
endless
singing
of
the
stream
is
hushing
me
into
a
sweet
drowsiness
even
as
i
write
by
the
way
i
wonder
if
i
have
written
sense
if
not
forgive
me
but
i
am
much
too
lazy
to
read
it
through
i
think
i
must
have
eaten
of
the
lotus
tommy
dear
write
when
you
can
and
tell
me
that
all
is
well
with
you
as
i
think
it
must
be
though
i
can
not
tell
with
your
always
loving
though
for
the
moment
strangely
bewitched
sister
stella
tommy
put
down
the
letter
and
lay
still
peering
forth
under
frowning
brows
he
could
hear
monck
footsteps
coming
through
the
gate
of
the
compound
but
he
was
not
paying
any
attention
to
monck
for
once
his
troubled
mind
scarcely
even
registered
the
coming
of
his
friend
only
when
the
latter
mounted
the
steps
on
to
the
verandah
and
began
to
move
along
it
did
he
turn
his
head
and
realize
his
presence
monck
came
to
a
stand
beside
him
well
tommy
he
said
is
it
time
to
turn
in
tommy
sat
up
oh
i
suppose
so
infernally
hot
is
it
i
been
reading
stella
letter
monck
lodged
his
shoulder
against
the
i
hope
she
is
all
right
he
said
formally
his
voice
sounded
it
did
not
convey
to
tommy
the
idea
that
he
was
greatly
interested
in
his
reply
he
answered
with
something
of
an
effort
i
believe
she
is
she
really
say
i
wish
they
had
been
content
to
stay
at
bhulwana
i
could
have
got
leave
to
go
over
and
see
her
there
where
exactly
are
they
now
asked
monck
tommy
explained
to
the
best
of
his
ability
srinagar
seems
their
nearest
point
of
civilization
they
are
camping
in
the
wilderness
but
they
will
have
to
move
before
long
dacre
leave
will
be
up
and
they
must
allow
time
to
get
back
stella
talks
as
if
they
are
fixed
there
for
ever
and
ever
she
is
enjoying
it
then
monck
voice
still
sounded
as
if
he
were
thinking
of
something
else
tommy
made
grudging
reply
i
suppose
she
is
after
a
fashion
pretty
sure
of
one
thing
he
spoke
with
abrupt
force
she
enjoy
it
a
deal
more
if
i
were
with
her
instead
of
dacre
monck
laughed
a
curt
dry
laugh
jealous
eh
no
i
not
such
a
fool
the
boy
spoke
recklessly
but
i
know
i
ca
help
knowing
that
she
does
care
twopence
about
the
man
what
woman
with
any
brains
could
there
no
accounting
for
women
tastes
or
actions
at
any
time
said
monck
she
liked
him
well
enough
to
marry
him
tommy
made
an
indignant
sound
she
was
in
a
mood
to
marry
any
one
she
probably
have
married
you
if
you
asked
her
monck
made
an
abrupt
movement
as
if
he
had
lost
his
balance
but
he
returned
to
his
former
position
immediately
think
so
he
said
in
a
voice
that
sounded
very
ironical
then
possibly
she
has
had
a
lucky
escape
i
might
have
been
moved
to
ask
her
if
she
had
remained
free
much
longer
i
wish
to
heaven
you
had
said
tommy
bluntly
and
again
monck
uttered
his
short
sardonic
laugh
thank
you
tommy
he
said
there
fell
a
silence
between
them
and
a
hot
draught
eddied
up
through
the
parched
compound
and
rattled
the
scorched
twigs
of
the
creeping
rose
on
the
verandah
with
a
desolate
sound
as
if
skeleton
hands
were
feeling
along
the
tommy
suppressed
a
shudder
and
got
to
his
feet
in
the
same
moment
monck
spoke
again
deliberately
emotionlessly
with
a
hint
of
grimness
by
the
way
tommy
i
a
piece
of
news
for
you
that
letter
i
had
from
my
brother
this
evening
contained
news
of
an
urgent
business
matter
which
only
i
can
deal
with
it
has
come
at
a
rather
unfortunate
moment
as
barnes
the
policeman
brought
some
disturbing
information
this
evening
from
khanmulla
and
the
chief
wanted
to
make
use
of
me
in
that
quarter
they
are
sending
a
mission
to
make
investigations
and
they
wanted
me
to
go
in
charge
of
it
oh
man
tommy
eyes
suddenly
shone
with
enthusiasm
what
a
chance
a
chance
i
not
going
to
take
rejoined
monck
dryly
i
applied
for
leave
instead
in
any
case
it
is
due
to
me
but
dacre
had
his
turn
first
the
chief
did
want
to
grant
it
but
he
gave
way
in
the
end
you
boys
will
have
to
work
a
little
harder
than
usual
that
all
tommy
was
staring
at
him
in
amazement
but
i
say
monck
he
protested
that
mission
business
it
the
very
thing
you
most
enjoy
surely
you
ca
be
going
to
let
such
an
opportunity
slip
my
own
business
is
more
pressing
monck
returned
briefly
then
tommy
remembered
the
stricken
look
that
he
had
surprised
on
his
friend
face
that
evening
and
swift
concern
swallowed
his
astonishment
you
had
bad
news
from
home
i
say
i
awfully
sorry
is
your
brother
ill
or
what
no
it
not
that
i
ca
discuss
it
with
you
tommy
but
i
got
to
go
the
chief
has
granted
me
eight
weeks
and
i
am
off
at
dawn
monck
made
as
if
he
would
turn
inwards
with
the
words
you
going
home
ejaculated
tommy
by
jove
old
fellow
it
be
quick
work
then
his
sympathy
coming
uppermost
again
i
say
confoundedly
sorry
you
take
care
of
yourself
oh
every
care
monck
paused
to
lay
an
unexpected
hand
upon
the
shoulder
and
you
must
take
care
of
yourself
tommy
he
said
get
up
to
any
tomfoolery
while
i
am
away
and
if
you
get
thirsty
stick
to
i
be
as
good
as
gold
tommy
promised
touched
alike
by
action
and
admonition
but
it
will
be
pretty
beastly
without
you
i
hate
a
lonely
life
and
stella
will
be
stuck
at
bhulwana
for
the
rest
of
the
hot
weather
when
they
get
back
well
i
sha
stay
away
for
ever
monck
patted
his
shoulder
and
turned
away
i
not
going
for
a
pleasure
trip
and
the
sooner
over
the
better
i
shall
be
pleased
he
passed
into
the
room
with
the
words
that
room
in
which
stella
had
sat
on
her
gazing
forth
into
the
night
and
there
came
to
tommy
a
curious
wandering
memory
of
his
friend
face
on
that
same
night
with
eyes
alight
and
ardent
looking
upwards
as
though
they
saw
a
vision
perplexed
and
vaguely
troubled
he
thrust
her
letter
away
into
his
pocket
and
went
to
his
own
room
chapter
vi
the
garden
the
heaven
of
the
orient
it
was
a
week
since
stella
had
penned
those
words
and
still
the
charm
held
her
the
wonder
grew
never
in
her
life
had
she
dreamed
of
a
land
so
perfect
so
subtly
alluring
so
overwhelmingly
full
of
enchantment
day
after
day
slipped
by
in
what
seemed
an
endless
succession
night
followed
magic
night
and
the
spell
wound
closer
and
ever
closer
about
her
she
sometimes
felt
as
if
her
very
individuality
were
being
absorbed
into
the
marvellous
beauty
about
her
as
if
she
had
been
crystallized
by
it
and
must
soon
cease
to
be
in
any
sense
a
being
apart
from
it
the
of
the
torrent
that
dashed
below
their
filled
her
brain
day
and
night
it
seemed
to
make
active
thought
impossible
to
dull
all
her
senses
save
the
one
luxurious
sense
of
enjoyment
that
was
always
present
slumbrous
almost
cloying
in
its
unfailing
sweetness
the
fruit
of
the
lotus
which
assuredly
she
was
eating
day
by
day
all
her
nerves
seemed
dormant
all
her
energies
lulled
sometimes
she
wondered
if
the
sound
of
running
water
had
this
stultifying
effect
upon
her
for
wherever
they
went
it
followed
them
the
streams
ran
everywhere
and
since
leaving
srinagar
she
could
not
remember
a
single
occasion
on
which
they
had
been
out
of
earshot
of
their
perpetual
music
it
haunted
her
like
a
ceaseless
refrain
but
yet
she
never
wearied
of
it
there
was
no
thought
of
weariness
in
this
mazed
of
hers
at
the
beginning
of
her
married
life
so
far
behind
her
now
that
she
scarcely
remembered
it
she
had
gone
through
pangs
of
suffering
and
fierce
regret
her
whole
nature
had
revolted
and
it
had
taken
all
her
strength
to
quell
it
but
that
was
long
long
past
she
had
ceased
to
feel
anything
now
but
a
dumb
and
even
placid
acquiescence
in
this
lethargic
existence
and
ralph
dacre
was
amply
satisfied
therewith
he
had
always
been
abundantly
confident
of
his
power
to
secure
her
happiness
and
he
was
blissfully
unconscious
of
the
wild
impulse
to
rebellion
which
she
had
barely
stifled
he
had
no
desire
to
sound
the
deeps
of
her
he
was
quite
content
with
life
as
he
found
it
content
to
share
with
her
the
dreamy
pleasures
that
lay
in
this
fruitful
wilderness
and
to
look
not
beyond
he
troubled
himself
but
little
about
the
future
though
when
he
thought
of
it
that
was
with
pleasure
too
he
liked
now
and
then
to
look
forward
to
the
days
that
were
coming
when
stella
would
shine
as
a
queen
his
queen
among
an
envious
crowd
her
position
assured
as
his
wife
even
lady
harriet
herself
would
have
to
lower
her
flag
and
how
little
netta
ermsted
would
grit
her
teeth
he
laughed
to
himself
whenever
he
thought
of
that
netta
had
become
too
uppish
of
late
it
would
be
amusing
to
see
how
she
took
her
lesson
and
as
for
his
even
the
taciturn
monck
had
already
shown
that
he
was
not
proof
against
stella
charms
he
wondered
what
stella
thought
of
the
man
well
knowing
that
few
women
liked
him
and
one
evening
as
they
sat
together
in
the
scented
darkness
with
the
roar
of
their
filling
the
silences
he
turned
their
fitful
conversation
in
monck
direction
to
satisfy
his
lazy
curiosity
in
this
respect
i
suppose
i
ought
to
write
to
the
fellow
he
said
but
if
written
to
tommy
it
almost
the
same
thing
besides
i
do
suppose
he
would
be
in
the
smallest
degree
interested
he
would
only
be
bored
there
was
a
pause
before
stella
answered
but
she
was
often
slow
of
speech
in
those
days
i
thought
you
were
friends
she
said
what
oh
so
we
are
ralph
dacre
laughed
his
easy
complacent
laugh
but
he
a
dark
horse
you
know
i
never
know
quite
how
to
take
him
your
brother
tommy
is
a
deal
more
intimate
with
him
than
i
am
though
i
have
stabled
with
him
for
over
four
years
he
a
very
clever
fellow
there
no
doubt
of
that
altogether
too
brainy
for
my
taste
clever
fellows
always
bore
me
now
i
wonder
how
he
strikes
you
again
there
was
that
slight
pause
before
stella
spoke
but
there
was
nothing
very
vital
about
it
she
seemed
to
be
slow
in
bringing
her
mind
to
bear
upon
the
subject
i
agree
with
you
she
said
then
he
is
clever
and
he
is
kind
too
he
has
been
very
good
to
tommy
tommy
would
lie
down
and
let
him
walk
over
him
remarked
dacre
perhaps
that
is
what
he
likes
but
he
a
sort
of
cuss
i
do
believe
he
has
a
spark
of
real
affection
for
anybody
he
is
too
ambitious
is
he
ambitious
stella
voice
sounded
rather
weary
wholly
void
of
interest
dacre
inhaled
a
deep
breath
of
and
puffed
it
slowly
forth
his
curiosity
was
warming
oh
yes
ambitious
as
they
made
those
strong
silent
chaps
always
are
and
there
no
doubt
he
will
make
his
mark
some
day
he
is
a
positive
marvel
at
languages
and
he
dabbles
in
secret
service
matters
too
disguises
himself
and
goes
among
the
natives
in
the
bazaars
as
one
of
themselves
a
fellow
like
that
you
know
is
simply
priceless
to
the
government
and
he
is
as
tough
as
leather
the
climate
never
touches
him
he
could
sit
on
a
grille
and
be
happy
no
doubt
he
will
be
a
very
big
pot
some
day
he
tipped
the
ash
from
his
cigar
you
and
i
will
be
comfortably
growing
old
in
a
villa
at
cheltenham
by
that
time
he
ended
a
little
shiver
went
through
stella
she
said
nothing
and
silence
fell
between
them
again
the
moon
was
rising
behind
a
rugged
line
of
across
the
valley
touching
them
here
and
there
with
a
silvery
radiance
casting
mysterious
shadows
all
about
them
sending
a
magic
twilight
over
the
whole
world
so
that
they
saw
it
dimly
as
through
a
luminous
veil
the
scent
of
dacre
cigar
hung
in
the
air
fragrant
aromatic
eastern
he
was
sleepily
watching
his
wife
pure
profile
as
she
gazed
into
her
world
of
dreams
it
was
evident
that
she
took
small
interest
in
monck
and
his
probable
career
it
was
not
surprising
monck
was
not
the
sort
of
man
to
attract
women
he
cared
so
little
about
them
this
silent
watcher
whose
eyes
were
ever
searching
below
the
surface
of
eastern
life
who
studied
and
read
and
knew
so
much
more
than
any
one
else
and
yet
who
guarded
knowledge
and
methods
so
closely
that
only
those
in
contact
with
his
daily
life
suspected
what
he
hid
he
will
surprise
us
all
some
day
dacre
placidly
reflected
those
quiet
ambitious
chaps
always
soar
high
but
i
would
change
places
with
him
even
if
he
wins
to
the
top
of
the
tree
people
who
make
a
specialty
of
hard
work
never
get
any
fun
out
of
anything
by
the
time
the
fun
comes
along
they
are
too
old
to
enjoy
it
and
so
he
lay
at
ease
in
his
chair
feasting
his
eyes
upon
his
young
wife
grave
face
savouring
life
with
the
zest
of
the
epicurean
placidly
at
peace
with
all
the
world
on
that
night
of
dreams
it
was
growing
late
and
the
moon
had
topped
the
distant
peaks
sending
a
flood
of
light
across
the
sleeping
valley
before
he
finally
threw
away
the
stump
of
his
cigar
and
stretched
forth
a
lazy
arm
to
draw
her
to
him
why
so
silent
star
of
my
heart
where
are
those
wandering
thoughts
of
yours
she
submitted
as
usual
to
his
touch
passively
without
enthusiasm
my
thoughts
are
not
worth
expressing
ralph
she
said
let
us
hear
them
all
the
same
he
said
laying
his
head
against
her
shoulder
she
sat
very
still
in
his
hold
i
was
only
watching
the
moonlight
she
said
somehow
it
made
me
think
of
a
flaming
sword
turning
all
ways
he
suggested
indolently
humorous
not
driving
us
forth
out
of
the
garden
of
eden
i
hope
that
would
be
a
little
hard
on
two
such
inoffensive
mortals
as
we
are
eh
sweetheart
i
do
know
she
said
seriously
i
doubt
if
the
plea
of
inoffensiveness
would
open
the
gates
of
heaven
to
any
one
he
laughed
i
ca
talk
ethics
at
this
time
of
night
star
of
my
heart
it
time
we
went
to
our
lair
i
believe
you
would
sit
here
till
sunrise
if
i
would
let
you
you
most
ethereal
of
women
do
you
ever
think
of
your
body
at
all
i
wonder
he
kissed
her
neck
with
the
careless
words
and
a
quick
shiver
went
through
her
she
made
a
slight
scarcely
perceptible
movement
to
free
herself
but
the
next
moment
sharply
almost
convulsively
she
grasped
his
arm
ralph
what
is
that
she
was
gazing
towards
the
shadow
cast
by
a
patch
of
flowering
azalea
in
the
moonlight
about
ten
yards
from
where
they
sat
dacre
raised
himself
with
leisurely
and
peered
in
the
same
direction
it
was
not
his
nature
to
be
easily
disturbed
but
stella
hand
still
clung
to
his
arm
and
there
was
agitation
in
her
hold
what
is
it
she
whispered
what
can
it
be
i
have
seen
it
move
twice
ah
look
is
it
is
it
a
panther
good
gracious
child
no
carelessly
he
made
response
and
with
the
words
disengaged
himself
from
her
hand
and
stood
up
it
more
probably
some
filthy
old
beggar
who
fondly
thinks
he
is
going
to
get
for
disturbing
us
you
stay
here
while
i
go
and
investigate
but
some
nervous
impulse
goaded
stella
she
also
started
up
holding
him
back
oh
do
go
ralph
do
go
call
one
of
the
men
call
peter
he
laughed
at
her
agitation
my
dear
girl
do
be
absurd
i
want
peter
to
help
me
kick
a
beastly
native
in
fact
he
probably
would
lower
himself
to
do
such
a
thing
but
still
she
clung
to
him
ralph
do
go
please
do
go
i
have
a
feeling
i
am
afraid
i
she
broke
off
panting
her
fingers
tightly
clutching
his
sleeve
do
go
she
reiterated
he
put
his
arm
round
her
my
dear
what
do
you
think
a
tatterdemalion
gipsy
is
going
to
do
to
me
he
may
be
a
and
if
so
the
sooner
he
is
got
rid
of
the
better
there
what
did
i
tell
you
he
is
coming
out
of
his
corner
now
do
be
frightened
it
does
do
to
show
funk
to
these
people
he
held
her
closely
to
him
and
waited
beside
the
flowering
azalea
something
was
undoubtedly
moving
and
as
they
stood
and
watched
a
strange
figure
slowly
detached
itself
from
the
shadows
and
crept
towards
them
it
was
clad
in
native
garments
and
shuffled
along
in
a
bent
attitude
as
if
deformed
stella
stiffened
as
she
stood
there
was
something
unspeakably
repellent
to
her
in
its
toadlike
advance
make
one
of
the
men
send
him
away
she
whispered
urgently
please
do
it
may
be
a
as
you
say
he
moves
like
a
reptile
himself
and
i
abhor
snakes
but
dacre
stood
his
ground
he
felt
none
of
her
shrinking
horror
of
the
bowed
misshapen
creature
approaching
them
in
fact
he
was
only
curious
to
see
how
far
a
kashmiri
beggar
audacity
would
carry
him
within
half
a
dozen
paces
of
them
in
the
full
moonlight
the
shambling
figure
halted
and
salaamed
with
clawlike
hands
extended
his
deformity
bent
him
almost
double
but
he
was
so
muffled
in
rags
that
it
was
difficult
to
discern
any
tangible
human
shape
at
all
a
tangled
black
beard
hung
wisplike
from
the
dirty
that
draped
his
head
and
above
it
two
eyes
fevered
and
furtive
peered
strangely
forth
the
salaam
completed
the
intruder
straightened
himself
as
far
as
his
infirmity
would
permit
and
in
a
moment
spoke
in
the
weak
accents
of
an
old
old
man
will
his
most
gracious
excellency
be
pleased
to
permit
one
who
is
as
the
dust
beneath
his
feet
to
speak
in
his
presence
words
which
only
he
may
hear
it
was
the
whine
of
the
hindu
beggar
halting
supplicatory
almost
revoltingly
servile
stella
shuddered
with
disgust
the
whole
episode
was
so
utterly
out
of
place
in
that
moonlit
paradise
but
curiosity
was
evidently
aroused
to
her
urgent
whisper
to
send
the
man
away
he
paid
no
heed
some
spirit
of
perversity
or
was
it
the
hand
of
fate
upon
him
made
him
bestow
his
supercilious
attention
upon
the
cringing
visitor
speak
away
you
son
of
a
centipede
he
made
kindly
rejoinder
i
am
all
ears
the
also
the
man
waved
a
skinny
protesting
arm
only
his
most
gracious
excellency
he
insisted
seeming
to
utter
the
words
through
parched
lips
will
not
his
excellency
deign
to
give
his
unworthy
servant
one
precious
moment
that
he
may
speak
in
the
august
one
ear
alone
this
is
highly
mysterious
commented
dacre
i
think
i
shall
have
to
find
out
what
he
wants
eh
stella
his
information
may
be
valuable
oh
do
send
him
away
stella
entreated
i
am
not
used
to
these
natives
they
frighten
me
my
dear
child
what
nonsense
laughed
dacre
what
harm
do
you
imagine
a
doddering
old
fool
like
this
could
do
to
any
one
if
i
were
monck
i
should
invite
him
to
join
the
party
not
being
monck
i
propose
to
hear
what
he
has
to
say
and
then
kick
him
out
you
run
along
to
bed
dear
i
soon
settle
him
and
follow
you
do
be
uneasy
there
is
really
no
need
he
kissed
her
lightly
with
the
words
flattered
by
her
evident
anxiety
on
his
behalf
though
fully
determined
to
ignore
it
stella
turned
beside
him
in
silence
aware
that
he
could
be
immovably
obstinate
when
once
his
mind
was
made
up
but
the
feeling
of
dread
remained
upon
her
in
some
fantastic
fashion
the
beauty
of
the
night
had
become
marred
as
though
evil
spirits
were
abroad
for
the
first
time
she
wanted
to
keep
her
husband
at
her
side
but
it
was
useless
to
protest
she
was
moreover
herself
at
her
uneasiness
and
his
treatment
of
it
stung
her
into
the
determination
to
dismiss
it
she
parted
with
him
before
their
tent
with
no
further
sign
of
reluctance
he
on
his
part
kissed
her
in
his
usual
voluptuous
fashion
darling
he
said
lightly
do
lie
awake
for
me
when
i
have
got
rid
of
this
old
arabian
nights
sinner
i
may
have
another
smoke
but
get
impatient
i
sha
be
late
she
withdrew
herself
from
him
almost
with
coldness
had
she
ever
been
impatient
for
his
coming
she
entered
the
tent
proudly
her
head
high
but
the
moment
she
was
alone
reaction
came
she
stood
with
her
hands
gripped
together
fighting
the
old
intolerable
misgiving
that
even
the
lulling
magic
all
around
her
had
never
succeeded
in
stilling
what
was
she
doing
in
this
garden
of
delights
with
a
man
she
did
not
love
had
she
not
entered
as
it
were
by
stealth
how
long
would
it
be
before
her
presence
was
discovered
and
she
thrust
forth
into
the
outermost
darkness
in
shame
and
bitterness
of
soul
another
thought
was
struggling
at
the
back
of
her
mind
but
she
held
it
firmly
there
never
once
had
she
suffered
it
to
take
full
possession
of
her
it
belonged
to
that
other
life
which
she
had
found
too
hard
to
endure
vain
regrets
and
futile
longings
she
would
have
none
of
them
she
had
chosen
her
lot
she
would
abide
by
the
choice
yes
and
she
would
do
her
duty
also
whatever
it
might
entail
ralph
should
never
know
never
dimly
suspect
and
that
other
he
would
never
know
either
his
had
been
but
a
passing
fancy
he
trod
the
way
of
ambition
and
there
was
no
room
in
his
life
for
anything
besides
if
she
had
shown
him
her
heart
it
had
been
but
a
momentary
glimpse
and
he
had
forgotten
already
she
was
sure
he
had
forgotten
and
she
had
desired
that
he
should
forget
he
had
penetrated
her
stronghold
indeed
but
it
was
only
as
it
were
the
outer
defences
that
had
fallen
he
had
not
reached
the
inner
fort
no
man
would
ever
reach
that
now
certainly
most
certainly
not
the
man
to
whom
she
had
given
herself
and
to
none
other
would
the
chance
be
offered
no
she
was
secure
she
was
secure
she
guarded
her
heart
from
all
and
she
could
not
suffer
deeply
so
she
told
herself
so
long
as
she
kept
it
close
yet
as
the
of
the
torrent
lulled
her
to
sleep
a
face
she
knew
dark
strong
full
of
silent
purpose
rose
before
her
inner
vision
and
would
not
be
driven
forth
what
was
he
doing
was
he
wandering
about
the
bazaars
in
some
disguise
learning
the
secrets
of
that
strange
native
india
that
had
drawn
him
into
her
toils
she
tried
to
picture
that
hidden
life
of
his
but
could
not
the
keen
steady
eyes
set
in
that
calm
emotionless
face
held
her
persistently
defeating
imagination
of
one
thing
only
was
she
certain
he
might
baffle
others
but
by
no
amount
of
ingenuity
could
he
ever
deceive
her
she
would
recognize
him
in
a
moment
whatever
his
disguise
she
was
sure
that
she
would
know
him
those
grave
unflinching
eyes
would
surely
give
him
away
to
any
who
really
knew
him
so
ran
her
thoughts
on
that
night
of
magic
till
at
last
sleep
came
and
the
vision
faded
the
last
thing
she
knew
was
a
memory
that
awoke
and
mocked
her
the
sound
of
a
low
voice
that
in
spite
of
herself
she
had
to
hear
i
was
waiting
said
the
voice
till
my
turn
should
come
with
a
sharp
pang
she
cast
the
memory
from
her
and
slept
chapter
vii
the
serpent
in
the
garden
now
you
old
sinner
let
hear
your
valuable
piece
of
information
carelessly
ralph
dacre
sauntered
forth
again
into
the
moonlight
and
confronted
the
tatterdemalion
figure
of
his
visitor
the
contrast
between
them
was
almost
fantastic
so
strongly
did
the
arrogance
of
the
one
emphasize
the
deep
abasement
of
the
other
dacre
was
of
large
build
and
inclined
to
stoutness
he
had
the
ruddy
complexion
of
the
english
country
squire
he
moved
with
the
swagger
of
the
conquering
race
the
man
who
cringed
before
him
palsied
misshapen
a
mere
wreck
of
humanity
might
have
been
a
being
from
another
sphere
some
underworld
of
bizarre
creatures
that
crawled
purblind
among
shadows
he
salaamed
again
profoundly
in
response
to
dacre
contemptuous
words
nearly
rubbing
his
forehead
upon
the
ground
his
most
noble
excellency
is
pleased
to
be
gracious
he
murmured
if
he
will
deign
to
follow
his
miserably
unworthy
servant
up
the
where
none
may
overhear
he
will
speak
his
message
and
depart
oh
it
a
message
is
it
with
a
species
of
scornful
tolerance
dacre
turned
towards
the
path
indicated
well
lead
on
i
not
coming
far
no
not
for
untold
wealth
nor
am
i
going
to
waste
much
time
over
you
i
have
better
things
to
do
the
old
man
turned
also
with
a
cringing
movement
only
a
little
way
most
noble
he
said
in
his
thin
cracked
voice
only
a
little
way
hobbling
painfully
he
began
the
ascent
in
front
of
the
strolling
englishman
the
path
ran
steeply
up
between
shrubs
following
the
winding
of
the
torrent
far
below
in
places
the
hillside
was
precipitous
and
the
roar
of
the
stream
rose
louder
as
it
dashed
among
its
rocks
the
heavy
scent
of
the
azalea
flowers
hung
like
incense
everywhere
mingling
aromatically
with
the
smoke
from
dacre
newly
lighted
cigar
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
he
followed
his
guide
with
long
easy
strides
the
ascent
was
nothing
to
him
and
the
other
halting
progress
brought
a
smile
of
contemptuous
pity
to
his
lips
what
did
the
old
rascal
expect
to
gain
from
the
interview
he
wondered
up
and
up
the
narrow
path
they
went
till
at
length
a
small
natural
platform
in
the
shoulder
of
the
hill
was
reached
and
here
the
ragged
creature
in
front
of
dacre
paused
and
turned
the
moonlight
smote
full
upon
him
revealing
him
in
every
repulsive
detail
his
eyes
burned
in
their
sockets
as
he
lifted
them
but
he
did
not
speak
even
after
the
careless
saunter
of
the
englishman
had
ceased
at
his
side
the
dash
of
the
stream
far
below
rose
up
like
the
muffled
roar
of
a
train
in
a
tunnel
the
bed
of
it
was
very
narrow
at
that
point
and
the
current
swift
for
a
moment
or
two
dacre
stood
waiting
the
cigar
still
between
his
lips
his
eyes
upon
the
gleaming
caps
of
the
far
away
but
very
soon
the
spell
of
them
fell
from
him
it
was
not
his
nature
to
remain
silent
for
long
with
his
easy
superior
laugh
he
turned
and
looked
his
motionless
companion
up
and
down
well
he
said
have
you
brought
me
here
to
admire
the
view
very
fine
no
doubt
but
i
could
have
done
it
without
your
guidance
there
was
no
immediate
reply
to
his
carelessly
flung
query
and
faint
curiosity
arose
within
him
mingling
with
his
strong
contempt
he
pulled
a
hand
out
of
his
pocket
and
displayed
a
few
in
his
palm
well
he
said
again
what
may
this
valuable
piece
of
information
be
worth
the
other
made
an
abrupt
movement
it
was
almost
as
if
he
curbed
some
savage
impulse
to
violence
he
moved
back
a
pace
and
there
in
the
moonlight
before
dacre
insolent
gaze
he
changed
with
a
deep
breath
he
straightened
himself
to
the
height
of
a
tall
man
the
bent
contorted
limbs
became
lithe
and
strong
the
cringing
humility
slipped
from
him
like
a
garment
he
stood
upright
and
faced
ralph
dacre
a
man
in
the
prime
of
life
that
he
said
is
a
matter
of
opinion
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
it
has
cost
a
damned
uncomfortable
journey
but
it
will
probably
cost
you
more
than
that
great
jupiter
said
dacre
he
stood
and
stared
and
stared
the
curt
speech
the
almost
fiercely
contemptuous
bearing
the
absolute
unwavering
assurance
of
this
man
whom
but
a
moment
before
he
had
so
arrogantly
trampled
underfoot
sent
through
him
such
a
shock
of
amazement
as
nearly
deprived
him
of
the
power
to
think
perhaps
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
was
utterly
and
completely
at
a
loss
only
as
he
gazed
at
the
man
before
him
there
came
upon
him
sudden
as
a
blow
the
memory
of
a
certain
hot
day
more
than
a
year
before
when
he
and
everard
monck
had
wrestled
together
in
the
club
gymnasium
for
the
benefit
of
a
little
crowd
of
subalterns
who
had
eagerly
betted
upon
the
result
it
had
been
sinew
weight
and
after
a
tough
struggle
sinew
had
prevailed
he
remembered
the
unpleasant
sensation
of
defeat
even
now
though
he
had
had
the
grit
to
take
it
like
a
man
and
get
up
laughing
it
was
one
of
the
very
few
occasions
he
could
remember
upon
which
he
had
been
worsted
but
now
he
was
face
to
face
with
something
of
an
infinitely
more
serious
nature
this
man
with
the
stern
accusing
eyes
and
wholly
merciless
attitude
what
had
he
come
to
say
an
odd
sensation
stirred
at
dacre
heart
like
an
unsteady
hand
knocking
for
admittance
there
was
something
wrong
here
something
wrong
you
madman
he
said
at
length
and
with
the
words
pulled
himself
together
with
a
giant
effort
what
in
the
name
of
wonder
are
you
doing
here
he
had
bitten
his
cigar
through
in
his
astonishment
and
he
tossed
it
away
as
he
spoke
with
a
gesture
of
returning
confidence
he
silenced
the
uneasy
foreboding
within
and
met
the
hard
eyes
that
confronted
him
without
discomfiture
what
your
game
he
said
you
have
come
to
tell
me
something
i
suppose
but
why
on
earth
could
you
write
it
the
written
word
is
not
always
effectual
the
other
man
said
he
put
up
a
hand
abruptly
and
stripped
the
ragged
hair
from
his
face
pushing
back
the
heavy
folds
of
the
that
enveloped
his
head
as
he
did
so
his
features
gleamed
in
the
moonlight
lean
and
brown
unmistakably
british
monck
said
dacre
in
the
tone
of
one
verifying
a
suspicion
yes
monck
grimly
the
other
repeated
the
name
i
had
considerable
trouble
in
following
you
here
i
should
have
taken
it
if
i
had
had
a
very
urgent
reason
well
what
the
devil
is
it
dacre
spoke
with
the
exasperation
of
a
man
who
knows
himself
to
be
at
a
disadvantage
if
you
want
to
know
my
opinion
i
regard
such
conduct
as
damned
intrusive
at
such
a
time
but
if
you
any
decent
excuse
let
hear
it
he
had
never
adopted
that
tone
to
monck
before
but
he
had
been
rudely
jolted
out
of
his
usually
complacent
attitude
and
he
resented
presence
moreover
an
unpleasant
sense
of
inferiority
had
begun
to
make
itself
felt
there
was
something
judicial
about
monck
something
inexorable
and
condemnatory
something
that
aroused
in
him
every
instinct
of
but
monck
met
his
blustering
demand
with
the
utmost
calm
it
was
as
if
he
held
him
in
a
grip
of
iron
intention
from
which
no
struggles
however
desperate
could
set
him
free
he
took
an
envelope
from
the
folds
of
his
ragged
raiment
i
believe
you
have
heard
me
speak
of
my
brother
bernard
he
said
chaplain
of
charthurst
prison
dacre
nodded
the
fellow
who
writes
to
you
every
month
well
what
of
him
monck
steady
fingers
detached
and
unfolded
a
letter
you
had
better
read
for
yourself
he
said
and
held
it
out
but
curiously
dacre
hung
back
as
if
unwilling
to
touch
it
ca
you
tell
me
what
all
the
fuss
is
about
he
said
irritably
monck
hand
remained
inflexibly
extended
he
spoke
a
jarring
note
in
his
voice
oh
yes
i
can
tell
you
but
you
had
better
see
for
yourself
too
it
concerns
you
very
nearly
it
was
written
in
charthurst
prison
nearly
six
weeks
ago
where
a
woman
who
calls
herself
your
wife
is
undergoing
a
term
of
imprisonment
for
forgery
damnation
ralph
dacre
actually
staggered
as
if
he
had
received
a
blow
between
the
eyes
but
almost
in
the
next
moment
he
recovered
himself
and
uttered
a
quivering
laugh
man
alive
you
are
not
fool
enough
to
believe
such
a
story
as
that
he
said
and
you
have
come
all
this
way
in
this
fancy
to
tell
me
you
must
be
mad
monck
was
still
holding
out
the
letter
you
had
better
see
for
yourself
he
reiterated
it
is
damnably
circumstantial
i
tell
you
it
an
infernal
lie
flung
back
dacre
furiously
there
is
no
woman
on
this
earth
who
has
any
claim
on
me
except
stella
why
should
i
read
it
i
tell
you
it
nothing
but
damned
fabrication
a
tissue
of
abominable
falsehood
you
mean
to
deny
that
you
have
ever
been
through
any
form
of
marriage
before
said
monck
slowly
of
course
i
do
dacre
uttered
another
angry
laugh
you
must
be
a
positive
fool
to
imagine
such
a
thing
it
preposterous
unheard
of
of
course
i
have
never
been
married
before
what
are
you
thinking
of
monck
remained
unmoved
she
has
been
a
actress
he
said
her
name
is
or
was
madelina
belleville
do
you
tell
me
that
you
have
never
had
any
dealings
whatever
with
her
dacre
laughed
again
fiercely
scoffingly
you
do
imagine
that
i
would
marry
a
woman
of
that
sort
do
you
he
said
that
is
no
answer
to
my
question
monck
said
firmly
confound
you
dacre
blazed
into
open
wrath
who
the
devil
are
you
to
enquire
into
my
private
affairs
do
you
think
i
am
going
to
put
up
with
your
damned
impertinence
what
i
think
you
will
have
to
monck
spoke
quitely
but
there
was
deadly
determination
in
his
words
it
a
choice
of
evils
and
if
you
are
wise
you
will
choose
the
least
are
you
going
to
read
the
letter
dacre
stared
at
him
for
a
moment
or
two
with
eyes
of
glowering
resentment
but
in
the
end
he
put
forth
a
hand
not
wholly
steady
and
took
the
sheet
held
out
to
him
monck
stood
beside
him
in
utter
immobility
gazing
out
over
the
valley
with
a
changeless
vigilance
that
had
about
it
something
fateful
minutes
passed
dacre
seemed
unable
to
lift
his
eyes
from
the
page
but
it
fluttered
in
his
hold
though
the
night
was
still
as
if
a
strong
wind
were
blowing
suddenly
he
moved
as
one
who
violently
breaks
free
from
some
fettering
spell
he
uttered
a
bitter
oath
and
tore
the
sheet
of
paper
passionately
to
fragments
he
flung
them
to
the
ground
and
trampled
them
underfoot
ten
million
curses
on
her
he
raved
she
has
been
the
bane
of
my
life
monck
eyes
came
out
of
the
distance
and
surveyed
him
coldly
curious
i
thought
so
he
said
and
in
his
voice
was
an
odd
inflection
as
of
one
who
checks
a
laugh
at
an
jest
dacre
stamped
again
like
an
infuriated
bull
if
i
had
her
here
strangle
her
he
swore
that
brother
of
yours
is
an
artist
he
has
sketched
her
to
the
life
the
his
voice
cracked
and
broke
he
was
breathing
like
a
man
in
torture
he
swayed
as
he
stood
and
still
monck
remained
passive
grim
and
cold
and
unyielding
how
long
is
it
since
you
married
her
he
questioned
at
last
i
tell
you
i
never
married
her
desperately
dacre
sought
to
recover
lost
ground
but
he
had
slipped
too
far
you
told
me
that
lie
before
monck
observed
in
his
even
judicial
tones
is
it
worth
while
dacre
glared
at
him
but
his
glare
was
that
of
the
hunted
animal
trapped
and
helpless
he
was
conquered
and
he
knew
it
calmly
monck
continued
there
is
not
much
doubt
that
she
holds
proof
of
the
marriage
and
she
will
probably
try
to
establish
it
as
soon
as
she
is
free
she
will
never
get
anything
more
out
of
me
said
dacre
his
voice
was
low
and
sullen
there
was
that
in
the
other
man
attitude
that
stilled
his
fury
rendering
it
futile
even
in
a
fashion
ridiculous
i
am
not
thinking
of
you
monck
coldness
had
in
it
something
brutal
you
are
not
the
only
person
concerned
but
the
fact
remains
this
woman
is
your
wife
you
may
as
well
tell
the
truth
about
it
as
not
since
i
know
dacre
jerked
his
head
like
an
angry
bull
but
he
submitted
oh
well
if
you
must
have
it
i
suppose
she
was
once
he
said
she
caught
me
when
i
was
a
kid
of
she
was
a
bad
even
then
and
it
take
me
long
to
find
it
out
i
could
have
divorced
her
several
times
over
only
the
marriage
was
a
secret
and
i
did
want
my
people
to
know
the
last
i
heard
of
her
was
that
her
name
was
among
the
drowned
on
a
wrecked
liner
going
to
america
that
was
six
years
ago
or
more
and
i
was
thankful
to
be
rid
of
her
i
regarded
her
death
as
one
of
the
biggest
slices
of
luck
i
ever
had
and
now
curse
her
he
ended
savagely
she
has
come
to
life
again
he
glanced
at
monck
with
the
words
almost
as
if
seeking
sympathy
but
monck
face
was
masklike
in
its
unresponsiveness
he
said
nothing
whatever
in
a
moment
dacre
took
up
the
tale
i
considered
myself
free
ever
since
we
separated
after
only
six
weeks
together
any
man
would
it
was
nothing
but
a
passing
fancy
heaven
knows
why
i
was
fool
enough
to
marry
her
except
that
i
had
ideas
of
honour
in
those
days
and
i
got
drawn
in
she
never
regarded
it
as
binding
so
why
in
thunder
should
i
he
spoke
indignantly
as
one
who
had
the
right
of
complaint
your
ideas
of
honour
having
altered
somewhat
observed
monck
with
bitter
cynicism
dacre
winced
a
little
i
do
profess
to
be
anything
extraordinary
he
said
but
i
maintain
that
marriage
gives
no
woman
the
right
to
wreck
a
man
life
she
has
no
more
claim
upon
me
now
than
the
man
in
the
moon
if
she
tries
to
assert
it
she
will
soon
find
her
mistake
he
was
beginning
to
recover
his
balance
and
there
was
even
a
hint
of
his
customary
complacence
audible
in
his
voice
as
he
made
the
declaration
but
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
she
will
he
added
she
knows
very
well
that
she
has
nothing
whatever
to
gain
by
it
your
brother
seems
to
have
gathered
but
a
vague
idea
of
the
affair
you
had
better
write
and
tell
him
that
the
dacre
he
means
is
dead
your
belongs
to
another
branch
of
the
family
that
ought
to
satisfy
everybody
and
no
great
harm
done
what
he
uttered
the
last
word
with
a
tentative
disarming
smile
he
was
not
quite
sure
of
his
man
but
it
seemed
to
him
that
even
monck
must
see
the
utter
futility
of
making
a
disturbance
about
the
affair
at
this
stage
matters
had
gone
so
far
that
silence
was
the
only
course
silence
on
his
part
a
judicious
lie
or
two
on
the
part
of
monck
he
did
not
see
how
the
latter
could
refuse
to
render
him
so
small
a
service
as
he
himself
had
remarked
but
a
few
moments
before
he
dacre
was
not
the
only
person
concerned
but
the
absolute
and
uncompromising
silence
with
which
his
easy
suggestion
was
received
was
disquieting
he
hastened
to
break
it
divining
that
the
longer
it
lasted
the
less
was
it
likely
to
end
in
his
favour
come
i
say
he
urged
on
a
friendly
note
you
ca
refuse
to
do
this
much
for
a
comrade
in
a
tight
corner
i
do
the
same
for
you
and
more
and
remember
it
is
my
happiness
alone
that
hangs
in
the
balance
we
got
to
think
of
stella
monck
moved
at
that
moved
sharply
almost
with
violence
yet
when
he
spoke
his
voice
was
still
deliberate
cuttingly
distinct
yes
he
said
and
her
honour
is
worth
about
as
much
to
you
apparently
as
your
own
i
am
thinking
of
her
and
of
her
only
and
so
far
as
i
can
see
there
is
only
one
thing
to
be
done
oh
indeed
dacre
air
of
persuasion
dissolved
into
insolence
and
i
am
to
do
it
am
i
your
humble
servant
to
command
monck
stretched
forth
a
sinewy
arm
and
slowly
closed
his
fist
under
the
other
man
eyes
you
will
do
it
yes
he
said
i
hold
you
like
that
dacre
flinched
slightly
in
spite
of
himself
what
do
you
mean
you
would
never
be
such
a
such
a
cur
as
to
give
me
away
monck
made
a
sound
that
was
too
full
of
bitterness
to
be
termed
a
laugh
you
such
an
infernal
blackguard
he
said
that
i
do
care
a
damn
whether
you
go
to
the
devil
or
not
the
only
thing
that
concerns
me
is
how
to
protect
a
woman
honour
that
you
have
dared
to
jeopardize
how
to
save
her
from
open
shame
it
wo
be
an
easy
matter
but
it
can
be
done
and
it
shall
be
done
now
listen
his
voice
rang
suddenly
hard
almost
metallic
if
this
thing
is
to
be
kept
from
her
as
it
must
be
as
it
shall
be
you
must
drop
out
vanish
so
far
as
she
is
concerned
you
must
die
i
dacre
stared
at
him
in
startled
incredulity
man
are
you
mad
i
am
not
keen
as
bared
steel
came
the
answer
monck
impassivity
was
gone
his
face
was
darkly
passionate
his
whole
bearing
that
of
a
man
relentlessly
set
upon
obtaining
the
mastery
but
if
you
imagine
her
safety
can
be
secured
without
a
sacrifice
you
are
wrong
do
you
think
i
am
going
to
stand
tamely
by
and
see
an
innocent
woman
dragged
down
to
your
beastly
level
what
do
you
suppose
her
point
of
view
would
be
how
would
she
treat
the
situation
if
she
ever
came
to
know
i
believe
she
would
kill
herself
but
she
never
need
know
she
never
shall
know
there
was
a
note
of
desperation
in
dacre
rejoinder
you
have
only
got
to
hush
it
up
and
it
will
die
a
natural
death
that
will
never
take
the
trouble
to
follow
me
out
here
why
should
she
she
knows
very
well
that
she
has
no
claim
whatever
upon
me
stella
is
the
only
woman
who
has
any
claim
upon
me
now
you
are
right
grimly
monck
took
him
up
and
her
claim
is
the
claim
of
an
honourable
woman
to
honourable
treatment
and
so
far
as
lies
in
your
power
and
mine
she
shall
have
it
that
is
why
you
will
do
this
thing
disappear
go
out
of
her
life
for
good
and
let
her
think
you
dead
i
will
undertake
then
that
the
truth
shall
never
reach
her
she
will
be
safe
but
there
can
be
no
middle
course
she
shall
not
be
exposed
to
the
damnable
risk
of
finding
herself
stranded
he
ceased
to
speak
and
in
the
moonlight
their
eyes
met
as
the
eyes
of
men
who
grip
together
in
a
the
silence
between
them
was
more
terrible
than
words
it
held
unutterable
things
dacre
spoke
at
last
his
voice
low
and
hoarse
i
ca
do
it
there
is
too
much
involved
besides
it
would
really
help
she
would
come
to
know
inevitably
she
will
never
know
inexorably
came
the
answer
spoken
with
pitiless
insistence
as
to
ways
and
means
i
have
provided
for
them
it
wo
be
difficult
in
this
wilderness
to
cover
your
tracks
when
the
news
has
gone
forth
that
you
are
dead
no
one
will
look
for
you
a
hard
shiver
went
through
dacre
his
hands
clenched
he
was
as
a
man
in
the
presence
of
his
executioner
the
paralysing
spell
was
upon
him
again
constricting
as
a
rope
about
his
neck
but
sacrifice
was
no
part
of
his
nature
with
despair
at
his
heart
he
yet
made
a
desperate
bid
for
freedom
the
whole
business
is
outrageous
he
said
it
is
out
of
the
question
i
refuse
to
do
it
matters
have
gone
too
far
to
all
intents
and
purposes
stella
is
my
wife
and
i
damned
if
any
one
shall
come
between
us
you
may
do
your
worst
i
refuse
defiance
was
his
only
weapon
and
he
hurled
it
with
all
his
strength
but
the
moment
he
had
done
so
he
realized
the
hopelessness
of
the
venture
monck
made
a
single
swift
movement
and
in
a
moment
the
moonlight
glinted
upon
the
polished
muzzle
of
a
service
revolver
he
spoke
briefly
with
iron
coldness
the
choice
is
yours
only
if
you
refuse
to
give
her
the
sanctuary
of
widowhood
i
will
after
all
it
would
be
the
safest
way
for
all
concerned
dacre
went
back
a
pace
going
to
murder
me
what
he
said
monck
teeth
gleamed
in
a
terrible
smile
you
need
not
refuse
he
said
true
dacre
was
looking
him
full
in
the
eyes
with
more
of
curiosity
than
apprehension
and
as
you
have
foreseen
i
shall
not
refuse
under
those
circumstances
it
would
have
saved
time
if
you
had
put
it
in
that
light
before
it
would
but
i
hoped
you
might
have
the
decency
to
act
without
persuasion
monck
was
speaking
between
his
teeth
but
the
revolver
was
concealed
again
in
the
folds
of
his
garment
you
will
leave
at
once
without
seeing
her
again
that
is
understood
it
was
the
end
of
the
conflict
dacre
attempted
no
further
resistance
he
was
not
the
man
to
waste
himself
upon
a
cause
that
he
realized
to
be
hopeless
moreover
there
was
about
monck
at
that
moment
a
force
that
restrained
him
compelled
instinctive
respect
though
he
hated
the
man
for
his
mastery
he
could
not
despise
him
for
he
knew
that
what
he
had
done
had
been
done
through
a
rigid
sense
of
honour
and
that
chivalry
which
goes
hand
in
hand
with
honour
the
chivalry
with
which
no
woman
would
have
credited
him
that
monck
had
nought
but
the
most
disinterested
regard
for
any
woman
he
firmly
believed
and
probably
that
conviction
gave
added
strength
to
his
position
that
he
should
fight
thus
for
a
mere
principle
though
incomprehensible
in
dacre
opinion
was
a
circumstance
that
carried
infinitely
more
weight
than
more
personal
championship
monck
was
the
one
man
of
his
acquaintance
who
had
never
displayed
the
smallest
desire
to
compete
for
any
woman
favour
who
had
never
indeed
shown
himself
to
be
drawn
by
any
feminine
attractions
and
his
sudden
assumption
of
authority
was
therefore
unassailable
in
yielding
to
the
greater
power
dacre
yielded
to
a
moral
force
rather
than
to
human
compulsion
and
though
driven
sorely
against
his
will
he
respected
the
power
that
drove
his
dumb
gesture
of
acquiescence
conveyed
as
much
as
he
turned
away
relinquishing
the
struggle
he
had
fought
hard
and
he
had
been
defeated
it
was
bitter
enough
but
after
all
he
had
had
his
turn
the
first
hot
rapture
was
already
passing
love
in
the
wilderness
could
not
last
for
ever
it
had
been
fierce
enough
too
fierce
to
endure
and
characteristically
he
reflected
that
stella
cold
beauty
would
not
have
held
him
for
long
he
preferred
something
more
ardent
more
living
moreover
his
nature
demanded
a
certain
meed
of
homage
from
the
object
of
his
desire
and
undeniably
this
had
been
conspicuously
lacking
stella
was
evidently
one
to
accept
rather
than
to
give
and
there
had
been
moments
when
this
had
slightly
galled
him
she
seemed
to
him
fundamentally
incapable
of
any
deep
feeling
and
though
this
had
not
begun
to
affect
their
relations
at
present
he
had
realized
in
a
vague
fashion
that
because
of
it
she
would
not
hold
him
for
ever
so
after
the
first
he
knew
that
he
would
find
consolation
certainly
he
would
not
break
his
heart
for
her
or
for
any
woman
nor
did
he
flatter
himself
that
she
would
break
hers
for
him
meantime
he
prepared
to
shrug
his
shoulders
over
the
inevitable
things
might
have
been
much
worse
and
perhaps
on
the
whole
it
was
safer
to
obey
monck
command
and
go
an
open
scandal
would
really
be
a
good
deal
worse
for
him
than
for
stella
who
had
little
to
lose
and
there
was
no
knowing
what
might
happen
if
he
took
the
risk
and
remained
emphatically
he
had
no
desire
to
face
a
personal
reckoning
at
some
future
date
with
the
who
had
been
the
bane
of
his
existence
it
was
an
unlikely
contingency
but
undoubtedly
it
existed
and
he
hated
unpleasantness
of
all
kinds
so
philosophically
he
resolved
to
adjust
himself
to
this
burden
there
was
something
of
the
adventurer
in
his
blood
and
he
had
a
vast
belief
in
his
own
ultimate
good
luck
fortune
might
frown
for
awhile
but
he
knew
that
he
was
fortune
favourite
notwithstanding
and
very
soon
she
would
smile
again
but
for
monck
he
had
only
the
bitter
hate
of
the
conquered
he
cast
a
malevolent
look
upon
him
with
eyes
that
were
oddly
narrowed
a
measuring
speculative
look
that
comprehended
his
strength
and
registered
the
infallibility
thereof
with
loathing
i
wonder
what
happened
to
the
serpent
he
said
when
the
man
and
woman
were
thrust
out
of
the
garden
monck
had
readjusted
his
disguise
he
looked
back
with
baffling
inscrutable
eyes
his
dark
face
masklike
in
its
impenetrability
but
he
spoke
no
word
in
answer
he
had
said
his
say
like
a
mantle
he
gathered
his
reserve
about
him
again
as
a
man
resuming
a
solitary
journey
through
the
desert
which
all
his
life
he
had
travelled
alone
chapter
viii
the
forbidden
paradise
looking
back
later
upon
that
fateful
night
it
seemed
to
stella
that
she
must
indeed
have
slept
the
sleep
of
the
for
no
misgivings
pierced
the
numb
unconsciousness
that
held
her
through
the
still
hours
she
lay
as
one
in
a
trance
wholly
insensible
of
the
fact
that
she
was
alone
aware
only
of
the
perpetual
rush
and
fall
of
the
torrent
below
which
seemed
to
act
like
a
narcotic
upon
her
brain
when
she
awoke
at
length
broad
daylight
was
all
about
her
and
above
the
roar
of
the
stream
there
was
rising
a
hubbub
of
voices
like
the
buzzing
of
a
swarm
of
bees
she
lay
for
awhile
listening
to
it
lazily
wondering
why
the
coolies
should
bring
their
breakfast
so
much
nearer
to
the
tent
than
usually
and
then
suddenly
and
terribly
there
came
a
cry
that
seemed
to
transfix
her
stabbing
her
heavy
senses
to
full
consciousness
for
a
second
or
two
she
lay
as
if
petrified
every
limb
struck
powerless
every
nerve
strained
to
listen
who
had
uttered
that
dreadful
wail
what
did
it
portend
then
her
strength
returning
she
started
up
and
knew
that
she
was
alone
the
by
her
side
was
empty
it
had
not
been
touched
fear
nameless
and
chill
swept
through
her
she
felt
her
very
heart
turn
cold
shivering
she
seized
a
wrap
and
crept
to
the
the
flap
was
unfastened
just
as
it
had
been
left
by
her
husband
the
night
before
with
shaking
fingers
she
drew
it
aside
and
looked
forth
the
hubbub
of
voices
had
died
down
to
awed
whisperings
a
group
of
coolies
huddled
in
the
open
space
before
her
like
an
assembly
of
monkeys
holding
an
important
discussion
further
away
with
distorted
limbs
and
grim
impassive
countenance
crouched
the
beggar
whose
importunity
had
lured
ralph
from
her
side
the
previous
evening
his
sunken
eyes
gazed
like
the
eyes
of
a
dead
man
straight
into
the
sunrise
so
motionless
were
they
so
utterly
void
of
expression
that
she
thought
they
must
be
blind
there
was
something
fateful
something
terrible
in
the
aloofness
of
him
it
was
as
if
an
invisible
circle
surrounded
him
within
which
none
might
intrude
and
close
at
hand
so
close
that
she
could
have
touched
his
turbaned
head
as
she
stood
the
great
sikh
bearer
peter
sat
huddled
in
a
heap
on
the
soft
green
earth
and
rocked
himself
to
and
fro
like
a
child
in
trouble
she
knew
at
the
first
glance
that
it
was
he
who
had
uttered
that
anguished
wail
to
him
she
turned
as
to
the
only
being
she
could
trust
in
that
strange
scene
peter
she
said
what
has
happened
what
is
wrong
where
where
is
the
captain
he
gave
a
great
start
at
the
sound
of
her
voice
above
him
and
instantly
with
a
rapid
noiseless
movement
arose
and
bent
himself
before
her
the
will
pardon
her
servant
he
said
and
she
saw
that
his
dark
face
was
twisted
with
emotion
but
there
is
bad
news
for
her
the
captain
has
gone
gone
stella
echoed
the
word
uncomprehendingly
as
one
who
speaks
an
unknown
language
peter
look
fell
before
the
wide
questioning
of
hers
he
replied
almost
under
his
breath
it
was
in
the
still
hour
of
the
night
the
captain
slept
on
the
mountain
and
in
his
sleep
he
fell
and
was
taken
away
by
the
stream
taken
away
again
numbly
stella
repeated
his
words
she
felt
suddenly
very
weak
and
sick
peter
stretched
a
hand
towards
the
inscrutable
stranger
this
man
he
said
with
reverence
he
is
a
holy
man
and
while
praying
upon
the
mountain
top
he
saw
the
sunk
in
a
deep
sleep
fall
forward
over
the
rock
as
if
a
hand
had
touched
him
he
came
down
and
searched
for
him
but
he
was
gone
the
snows
are
melting
and
the
water
runs
swift
and
deep
ah
it
was
a
gasp
rather
than
an
exclamation
stella
was
blindly
tottering
against
the
clutching
vaguely
for
support
the
great
sikh
caught
her
ere
she
fell
his
own
distress
subdued
in
a
flash
before
the
urgency
of
her
need
lean
on
me
he
said
deference
and
devotion
mingling
in
his
voice
she
accepted
his
help
instinctively
scarcely
knowing
what
she
did
and
very
gently
with
a
woman
tenderness
he
led
her
back
into
the
tent
my
must
rest
he
said
and
i
will
find
a
woman
to
serve
her
she
opened
her
eyes
with
a
dizzy
sense
of
wonder
peter
had
never
failed
before
to
procure
anything
that
she
wanted
but
even
in
her
extremity
she
had
a
curiously
irrelevant
moment
of
conjecture
as
to
where
he
would
turn
in
the
wilderness
for
the
commodity
he
so
confidently
mentioned
then
the
anguish
returning
she
checked
his
motion
to
depart
no
no
peter
she
said
commanding
her
voice
with
difficulty
there
is
no
need
for
that
i
am
quite
all
right
but
but
tell
me
more
how
did
this
happen
why
did
he
sleep
on
the
mountain
how
should
the
servant
know
questioned
peter
gently
and
deferentially
as
one
who
reasoned
with
a
child
it
may
be
that
the
opium
of
his
cigar
was
stronger
than
usual
but
how
can
i
tell
opium
he
never
smoked
opium
stella
gazed
upon
him
in
fresh
bewilderment
surely
surely
not
she
said
as
though
seeking
to
convince
herself
how
should
i
know
the
indian
murmured
soothingly
she
became
suddenly
aware
that
further
inaction
was
unendurable
she
must
see
for
herself
she
must
know
the
whole
dreadful
truth
though
trembling
from
head
to
foot
she
spoke
with
decision
peter
go
outside
and
wait
for
me
keep
that
old
beggar
too
do
let
him
go
as
soon
as
i
am
dressed
we
will
go
to
the
place
and
look
for
him
she
stumbled
over
the
last
words
but
she
spoke
them
bravely
peter
straightened
himself
recognizing
the
voice
of
authority
with
a
deep
salaam
he
turned
and
passed
out
drawing
the
decorously
into
place
behind
him
and
then
with
fevered
energy
stella
dressed
her
hands
moved
with
lightning
speed
though
her
body
felt
curiously
weighted
and
unnatural
the
fantastic
thought
crossed
her
brain
that
it
was
as
though
she
prepared
herself
for
her
own
funeral
no
sound
reached
her
from
without
save
only
the
monotonous
and
endless
dashing
of
the
torrent
among
its
boulders
she
was
beginning
to
feel
that
the
sound
in
some
fashion
expressed
a
curse
when
she
was
ready
at
length
she
stood
for
a
second
or
two
to
gather
her
strength
she
still
felt
ill
and
dizzy
as
though
the
world
she
knew
had
suddenly
fallen
away
from
her
and
left
her
struggling
in
unimaginable
space
like
a
swimmer
in
deep
waters
but
she
conquered
her
weakness
and
drawing
aside
the
once
more
she
stepped
forth
the
morning
sun
struck
full
upon
her
it
was
as
if
the
whole
earth
rushed
to
meet
her
in
a
riot
of
rejoicing
but
she
was
in
some
fashion
outside
and
beyond
it
all
the
glow
could
not
reach
her
with
a
sharp
sense
of
revulsion
she
saw
the
deformed
man
squatting
close
to
her
his
head
lodged
upon
his
knees
he
did
not
stir
at
her
coming
though
she
felt
convinced
that
he
was
aware
of
her
aware
probably
of
everything
that
passed
within
a
considerable
radius
of
his
disreputable
person
his
dark
face
lined
and
dirty
with
ragged
black
hair
that
ended
in
a
long
thin
wisp
like
a
goat
beard
on
his
shrunken
chest
was
still
turned
to
the
east
as
though
challenging
the
sun
that
was
smiting
a
swift
course
through
the
heavens
as
if
with
a
flaming
sword
the
simile
rushed
through
her
mind
unbidden
where
would
she
be
what
would
have
happened
to
her
by
the
time
that
sword
was
sheathed
she
conquered
her
repulsion
and
approached
the
man
as
she
did
so
peter
glided
silently
up
like
a
faithful
and
took
his
place
at
her
right
hand
it
was
typical
of
the
position
he
was
to
occupy
in
the
days
that
were
coming
within
a
pace
or
two
of
the
huddled
figure
stella
stopped
he
had
not
moved
it
was
evident
that
he
was
so
rapt
in
meditation
that
her
presence
at
that
moment
was
no
more
to
him
than
that
of
an
insect
crawling
across
his
path
his
eyes
startlingly
bright
still
challenged
the
coming
day
his
whole
expression
was
so
grimly
aloof
so
sternly
unsympathetic
that
she
hesitated
to
disturb
him
humbly
peter
came
to
her
assistance
may
i
be
allowed
to
speak
to
him
he
asked
she
turned
to
him
thankfully
yes
tell
him
what
i
want
peter
placed
himself
in
front
of
the
stranger
the
noble
lady
desires
your
service
he
said
her
gracious
excellency
is
waiting
a
quiver
went
through
the
crouching
form
he
seemed
to
awake
his
mind
returning
as
it
were
from
a
far
distance
he
turned
his
head
and
stella
saw
that
he
was
not
blind
for
his
eyes
took
her
in
for
the
moment
appraised
her
then
with
ungainly
tortoiselike
movements
he
arose
i
am
her
excellency
servant
he
said
in
hollow
quavering
accents
i
live
or
die
at
her
most
gracious
command
it
was
abjectly
spoken
yet
she
shuddered
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
her
whole
being
revolted
against
holding
any
converse
with
the
man
but
she
forced
herself
to
persist
only
this
monstrous
creature
could
give
her
any
detail
of
the
awful
thing
that
had
happened
in
the
night
if
ralph
were
indeed
dead
this
man
was
the
last
who
had
seen
him
in
life
with
a
strong
effort
she
subdued
her
repugnance
and
addressed
him
i
want
she
said
to
be
guided
to
the
place
from
which
you
say
he
fell
i
must
see
for
myself
he
bent
himself
almost
to
the
earth
before
her
let
the
gracious
lady
follow
her
servant
he
said
and
forthwith
straightened
himself
and
hobbled
away
she
followed
him
in
utter
silence
peter
walking
at
her
right
hand
up
the
steep
which
dacre
had
so
arrogantly
ascended
in
the
wake
of
his
halting
guide
they
made
their
slow
progress
in
dumb
procession
stella
moved
as
one
rapt
in
some
terrible
dream
again
that
drugged
feeling
was
upon
her
that
sense
of
being
bound
by
a
spell
and
now
she
knew
that
the
spell
was
evil
once
or
twice
her
brain
stirred
a
little
when
peter
offered
his
silent
help
and
she
thanked
him
and
accepted
it
while
scarcely
realizing
what
she
did
but
for
the
most
part
she
remained
in
that
state
of
awful
quiescence
the
inertia
of
one
about
whom
the
toils
of
a
pitiless
fate
were
closely
woven
there
was
no
escape
for
her
she
knew
that
there
could
be
no
escape
she
had
been
caught
trespassing
in
a
forbidden
paradise
and
she
was
about
to
be
thrust
forth
without
mercy
high
up
on
a
shelf
of
naked
rock
their
guide
stood
and
waited
a
ragged
incongruous
figure
against
the
purity
of
the
new
day
the
early
sun
had
barely
topped
the
highest
mountains
but
a
great
gap
between
two
mighty
peaks
revealed
it
as
stella
pressed
forward
she
came
suddenly
into
the
splendour
of
the
morning
it
affected
her
strangely
she
felt
as
moses
must
have
felt
when
the
glory
of
god
was
revealed
to
him
the
brightness
was
intolerable
it
seemed
to
pierce
her
through
and
through
she
was
not
able
to
look
upon
it
excellency
the
stranger
said
it
was
here
she
moved
forward
and
stood
beside
him
quiveringly
in
a
voice
she
hardly
recognized
as
her
own
she
spoke
you
were
with
him
you
brought
him
here
he
made
a
gesture
as
of
one
who
repudiates
responsibility
i
excellency
i
am
the
servant
of
the
holy
ones
he
said
i
had
a
message
for
him
i
knew
that
the
holy
ones
were
angry
it
was
written
that
the
white
should
not
tread
the
sacred
ground
i
warned
him
excellency
and
then
i
left
him
and
now
the
holy
ones
have
worked
their
will
upon
him
and
lo
he
is
gone
stella
gazed
at
the
man
with
fascinated
eyes
the
confidence
with
which
he
spoke
somehow
left
no
room
for
question
he
is
mad
she
murmured
half
to
herself
and
half
to
peter
of
course
he
is
mad
and
then
as
if
a
hand
had
touched
her
also
she
moved
forward
to
the
edge
of
the
precipice
and
looked
down
the
rush
of
the
torrent
rose
up
like
the
tumult
of
many
voices
calling
to
her
calling
to
her
the
depth
beneath
her
feet
widened
to
an
abyss
that
yawned
to
engulf
her
with
a
sick
sense
of
horror
she
realized
that
ghastly
headlong
fall
from
warm
throbbing
life
on
the
enchanted
height
to
instant
and
terrible
destruction
upon
the
green
slimy
boulders
over
which
the
water
dashed
and
roared
continuously
far
below
here
he
had
sat
that
arrogant
lover
of
hers
and
slipped
from
somnolent
enjoyment
into
that
dreadful
gulf
at
her
feet
proof
indisputable
of
the
truth
of
the
story
she
had
been
told
lay
a
charred
fragment
of
the
cigar
that
had
doubtless
been
between
his
lips
when
he
had
sunk
into
that
fatal
sleep
the
memory
of
peter
words
flashed
through
her
brain
he
had
smoked
opium
she
wondered
if
peter
really
knew
but
of
what
avail
now
to
conjecture
he
was
gone
and
only
this
mad
native
vagabond
had
witnessed
his
going
and
at
that
another
thought
pierced
her
keen
as
a
dagger
rending
its
way
through
living
tissues
the
manner
of
the
man
appearing
the
horror
with
which
he
had
inspired
her
the
mystery
of
him
all
combined
to
drive
it
home
to
her
heart
what
if
a
hand
had
indeed
touched
him
what
if
a
treacherous
blow
had
hurled
him
over
that
terrible
edge
she
turned
to
look
again
upon
the
stranger
but
he
had
withdrawn
himself
she
saw
only
the
indian
servant
standing
close
beside
her
his
dark
eyes
following
her
every
action
with
wistful
vigilance
meeting
her
desperate
gaze
he
pressed
a
little
nearer
like
a
faithful
dog
protective
and
devoted
come
away
my
he
entreated
very
earnestly
it
is
the
gate
of
death
that
pierced
her
anew
her
desolation
came
upon
her
in
an
overwhelming
wave
she
turned
with
a
great
cry
and
threw
her
arms
wide
to
the
risen
sun
tottering
blindly
towards
the
emptiness
that
stretched
beneath
her
feet
and
as
she
went
she
heard
the
roar
of
the
torrent
dashing
down
over
its
grim
boulders
to
the
great
river
up
which
they
two
had
glided
in
their
dream
of
enchantment
aeons
and
aeons
before
she
knew
nothing
of
the
sinewy
arms
that
held
her
back
from
death
though
she
fought
them
fiercely
desperately
she
did
not
hear
the
piteous
entreaties
of
poor
harassed
peter
as
he
forced
her
back
back
back
from
those
awful
depths
she
only
knew
a
great
turmoil
that
seemed
to
her
unending
a
fearful
striving
against
odds
and
at
the
last
a
swirling
unfathomable
darkness
descending
like
a
blanket
upon
her
enveloping
her
annihilating
her
and
british
eyes
keen
and
grey
and
stern
looked
on
from
afar
watching
silently
as
the
indian
bore
his
senseless
away
part
ii
chapter
i
the
ministering
angel
and
what
am
i
going
to
do
demanded
ermsted
fretfully
she
was
lounging
in
the
easiest
chair
in
ralston
with
a
cigarette
between
her
fingers
a
very
decided
frown
was
drawing
her
delicate
brows
i
had
no
idea
you
could
be
so
fickle
she
said
my
dear
i
shall
welcome
you
here
just
as
heartily
as
i
ever
have
ralston
assured
her
without
lifting
her
eyes
from
the
muslin
frock
at
which
she
was
busily
stitching
ermsted
pouted
that
may
be
but
i
sha
come
very
often
when
she
is
here
i
do
like
widows
they
are
either
so
melancholy
that
they
give
you
the
hump
or
so
that
you
want
to
slap
them
i
never
did
fancy
this
girl
as
you
know
much
too
haughty
and
superior
you
never
knew
her
dear
said
ralston
ermsted
laugh
had
a
touch
of
venom
as
i
have
tried
more
than
once
to
make
you
realize
she
said
there
are
at
least
two
points
of
view
to
everybody
you
dear
ralston
always
wear
spectacles
with
the
unfortunate
result
that
your
opinion
is
so
unvaryingly
favourable
that
nobody
values
it
ralston
faded
face
flushed
faintly
she
worked
on
in
silence
for
a
space
netta
ermsted
smoked
her
cigarette
with
her
eyes
fixed
upon
space
then
very
suddenly
she
spoke
again
i
wonder
if
ralph
dacre
committed
suicide
ralston
started
at
the
abrupt
surmise
she
looked
up
for
the
first
time
really
my
dear
what
an
extraordinary
thing
to
say
little
ermsted
jerked
up
her
chin
aggressively
why
extraordinary
i
wonder
nothing
could
be
more
extraordinary
than
his
death
either
he
jumped
over
the
precipice
or
she
pushed
him
over
when
he
was
looking
i
wonder
which
but
at
that
ralston
gravely
arose
and
rebuked
her
she
never
suffered
any
nervous
qualms
when
dealing
with
this
volatile
friend
of
hers
it
is
more
than
foolish
she
said
with
decision
it
is
wicked
to
talk
like
that
i
will
not
sit
and
listen
to
you
you
have
a
very
mischievous
brain
netta
you
ought
to
keep
it
under
better
control
ermsted
stretched
out
her
dainty
feet
in
front
of
her
and
made
a
grimace
when
you
call
me
netta
i
always
know
it
is
getting
serious
she
remarked
i
withdraw
it
all
my
dear
angel
with
the
utmost
liberality
you
shall
see
how
generous
i
can
be
to
my
supplanter
but
do
like
a
good
soul
finish
those
tiresome
tucks
before
you
begin
to
be
really
cross
with
me
poor
little
tessa
really
needs
that
frock
and
is
such
a
shocking
worker
i
sha
be
able
to
turn
to
you
for
anything
when
the
estimable
dacre
is
here
in
fact
i
shall
be
driven
to
burton
for
companionship
and
counsel
and
shall
become
more
catty
than
ever
my
dear
please
ralston
spoke
very
earnestly
do
not
imagine
for
an
instant
that
having
that
poor
girl
to
care
for
will
make
the
smallest
difference
to
my
friendship
for
you
i
hope
to
see
as
much
of
you
and
little
tessa
as
i
have
ever
seen
i
feel
that
stella
would
be
fond
of
children
your
little
one
would
be
a
comfort
to
any
sore
heart
she
can
be
a
positive
little
devil
observed
tessa
mother
dispassionately
but
it
better
than
being
a
saint
is
it
look
at
that
hateful
child
cedric
burton
detestable
little
ape
that
burton
complacency
gets
on
my
nerves
especially
in
a
child
but
then
look
at
the
burtons
how
could
they
help
having
horrible
little
apes
for
children
my
dear
your
tongue
your
tongue
protested
ralston
ermsted
shot
it
out
and
in
again
with
an
impudent
smile
well
what
the
matter
with
it
it
quite
a
candid
one
like
your
own
a
little
more
pointed
perhaps
and
something
venomous
upon
occasion
but
it
has
its
good
qualities
also
at
least
it
is
never
insincere
of
that
i
am
sure
ralston
spoke
with
ready
kindliness
but
oh
my
dear
if
it
were
only
a
little
more
charitable
netta
ermsted
smiled
at
her
like
a
wayward
child
i
like
saying
nasty
things
about
people
she
said
it
amuses
me
besides
they
nearly
always
true
do
tell
me
what
you
think
of
that
latest
hat
erection
of
lady
harriet
i
never
saw
her
look
more
aristocratically
hideous
in
my
life
than
she
looked
at
the
rajah
yesterday
i
felt
quite
sorry
for
the
rajah
for
he
a
nice
boy
notwithstanding
his
forty
wives
and
he
likes
pretty
things
she
gave
a
little
laugh
and
stretched
her
white
arms
up
clasping
her
hands
behind
her
head
i
have
promised
to
ride
with
him
in
the
early
mornings
now
and
then
darling
dick
be
jealous
when
he
knows
ralston
uttered
a
sigh
there
were
times
when
all
her
attempts
to
reform
this
giddy
little
butterfly
seemed
unavailing
nevertheless
being
sound
of
principle
and
unfailingly
conscientious
she
made
a
gallant
effort
do
you
think
you
ought
to
do
that
dear
i
always
think
that
we
ought
to
live
more
circumspectly
here
at
bhulwana
than
down
at
kurrumpore
and
if
i
may
be
allowed
to
say
so
your
husband
is
such
a
good
kind
man
so
indulgent
it
seems
unfair
to
take
advantage
of
it
oh
is
he
laughed
netta
how
ill
you
know
my
doughty
richard
why
it
half
the
fun
in
life
to
make
him
mad
he
nearly
turned
me
over
his
knee
and
spanked
me
the
last
time
my
dear
i
wish
he
had
said
ralston
with
downright
fervour
it
would
do
you
good
think
so
netta
flicked
the
ash
from
her
cigarette
with
a
disdainful
gesture
it
all
depends
i
should
either
worship
him
or
loath
him
afterwards
i
wonder
which
poor
old
richard
it
silly
of
him
to
stay
in
love
with
the
same
person
always
is
it
i
could
be
so
monotonous
if
i
tried
in
fact
if
he
cared
less
about
you
you
would
think
more
of
him
remarked
ralston
with
a
quite
unusual
touch
of
severity
netta
ermsted
laughed
again
her
light
heartless
laugh
how
crushingly
absolute
but
it
is
the
literal
truth
i
certainly
should
he
cheap
now
poor
old
boy
that
why
i
lead
him
such
a
dog
life
a
man
should
never
be
cheap
to
his
wife
now
look
at
your
husband
indifference
personified
and
you
have
never
given
him
an
hour
anxiety
in
his
life
ralston
pale
blue
eyes
suddenly
shone
she
looked
almost
young
again
we
understand
each
other
she
said
simply
a
mocking
smile
played
about
ermsted
lips
but
she
said
nothing
for
the
moment
in
her
own
fashion
she
was
fond
of
the
surgeon
wife
and
she
would
not
openly
deride
her
dear
good
soul
when
you
quite
finished
that
she
remarked
presently
there
a
tussore
frock
of
my
own
i
want
to
consult
you
about
there
one
thing
about
stella
she
wo
be
wanting
many
clothes
so
i
shall
be
able
to
retain
your
undivided
attention
in
that
respect
i
really
do
know
what
tessa
and
i
would
do
without
you
the
tiresome
little
thing
is
always
tearing
her
clothes
to
pieces
ralston
smiled
a
soft
you
a
lucky
lucky
girl
she
said
though
you
do
realize
it
and
probably
never
will
when
are
you
going
to
bring
the
little
monkey
to
see
me
again
she
will
probably
come
herself
when
the
mood
takes
her
carelessly
ermsted
made
reply
i
assure
you
you
stand
very
high
on
her
visiting
list
but
i
hardly
ever
take
her
anywhere
she
is
always
so
naughty
with
me
she
chose
another
cigarette
with
the
words
she
is
sure
to
be
a
pretty
frequent
visitor
while
tommy
denvers
is
here
she
worships
him
he
is
a
nice
boy
observed
ralston
i
wish
he
could
have
got
longer
leave
it
would
have
comforted
stella
to
have
him
i
suppose
she
can
go
down
to
him
at
kurrumpore
if
she
does
mind
sacrificing
that
complexion
rejoined
ermsted
shutting
her
matchbox
with
a
spiteful
click
you
stayed
down
last
hot
weather
gerald
was
not
well
and
could
leave
his
post
said
ralston
that
was
different
i
felt
he
needed
me
and
so
you
nearly
killed
yourself
to
satisfy
the
need
commented
ermsted
i
sometimes
think
you
are
rather
a
fine
woman
notwithstanding
appearances
she
glanced
at
the
watch
on
her
wrist
by
jove
how
late
it
is
your
latest
will
be
here
immediately
you
must
have
been
aching
to
tell
me
to
go
for
the
last
you
silly
saint
why
did
you
i
have
no
wish
for
you
to
go
dear
responded
ralston
tranquilly
all
my
visitors
are
an
honour
to
my
house
ermsted
sprang
to
her
feet
with
a
swift
elastic
movement
mary
i
love
you
she
said
you
are
a
ministering
angel
faithful
friend
and
priceless
counsellor
all
combined
i
laugh
at
you
for
a
frump
behind
your
back
but
when
i
am
with
you
i
am
spellbound
with
admiration
you
are
really
superb
thank
you
dear
said
ralston
she
returned
the
impulsive
kiss
bestowed
upon
her
with
a
funny
look
in
her
blue
eyes
that
might
almost
have
been
compassionate
if
it
had
not
been
so
unmistakably
humorous
she
did
not
attempt
to
make
the
embrace
a
lingering
one
however
and
netta
ermsted
took
her
impetuous
departure
with
a
piqued
sense
of
uncertainty
i
wonder
if
she
really
has
got
any
brains
after
all
she
said
aloud
as
she
sped
away
in
her
rickshaw
she
is
a
quaint
creature
anyhow
i
rather
wonder
that
i
bother
myself
with
her
at
which
juncture
she
met
the
rajah
resplendent
in
green
and
riding
his
favourite
bay
arab
and
forthwith
dismissed
ralston
and
all
discreet
counsels
to
the
limbo
of
forgotten
things
she
had
dubbed
the
rajah
her
arabian
knight
his
name
for
her
was
of
too
intimate
an
order
to
be
pronounced
in
public
she
was
the
lily
of
his
dreams
chapter
ii
the
return
stella
first
impression
of
bhulwana
was
the
extremely
european
atmosphere
that
pervaded
it
bungalows
and
seemed
to
be
its
main
characteristics
and
there
was
about
it
none
of
the
languorous
eastern
charm
that
had
so
haunted
the
forbidden
paradise
bhulwana
was
a
cheerful
place
and
though
perched
fairly
high
among
the
hills
of
markestan
it
was
possible
to
get
very
hot
there
for
this
reason
perhaps
all
the
energies
of
its
visitors
were
directed
towards
the
organizing
of
gaieties
and
in
the
height
of
the
summer
it
was
very
gay
indeed
the
rajah
summer
palace
white
and
magnificent
occupied
the
brow
of
the
hill
and
the
bungalows
that
clustered
among
the
pines
below
it
looked
as
if
there
had
been
some
competition
among
them
as
to
which
could
get
the
nearest
the
ralstons
bungalow
was
considerably
lower
down
the
hill
it
stood
upon
more
open
ground
than
most
and
overlooked
the
some
distance
below
it
was
an
ugly
little
place
and
the
small
compound
surrounding
it
was
a
veritable
wilderness
it
had
been
named
the
grand
stand
owing
to
its
position
but
no
one
less
racy
than
its
present
occupant
could
well
have
been
found
ralston
wistful
blue
eyes
seldom
rested
upon
the
they
looked
beyond
to
the
plains
the
room
she
had
prepared
for
stella
reception
looked
in
an
easterly
direction
towards
the
winding
wooded
road
that
led
up
to
the
residence
great
care
had
been
expended
upon
it
her
heart
had
yearned
to
the
girl
ever
since
she
had
heard
of
her
sudden
bereavement
and
her
delight
at
the
thought
of
receiving
her
was
only
second
to
her
sorrow
upon
stella
account
higher
up
the
hill
stood
the
dainty
bungalow
which
ralph
dacre
had
taken
for
his
bride
the
thought
of
it
tore
ralston
tender
heart
she
had
written
an
urgent
epistle
to
tommy
imploring
him
not
to
let
his
sister
go
there
in
her
desolation
and
swayed
by
tommy
influence
and
it
might
be
touched
by
ralston
own
earnest
solicitude
stella
not
caring
greatly
whither
she
went
had
agreed
to
take
up
her
abode
for
a
time
at
least
with
the
surgeon
wife
there
was
no
necessity
to
make
any
sudden
decision
the
whole
of
her
life
lay
before
her
a
dreary
waste
of
desert
it
did
not
seem
to
matter
at
that
stage
where
she
spent
those
first
forlorn
months
she
was
tired
to
the
soul
of
her
and
only
wanted
to
rest
she
hoped
vaguely
that
ralston
would
have
the
tact
to
respect
this
wish
of
hers
her
impression
of
this
the
only
woman
who
had
shown
her
any
kindness
since
her
arrival
in
india
was
not
of
a
very
definite
order
ralston
with
her
faded
prettiness
and
gentle
retiring
ways
did
not
possess
a
very
arresting
personality
no
one
seeing
her
two
or
three
times
could
have
given
any
very
accurate
description
of
her
lady
harriet
had
more
than
once
described
her
as
a
negligible
quantity
but
lady
harriet
systematically
neglected
everyone
who
had
no
pretensions
to
smartness
she
detested
all
dowdy
women
but
stella
still
remembered
with
gratitude
the
warmth
of
affectionate
admiration
and
sympathy
that
had
melted
her
coldness
on
her
and
something
within
her
notwithstanding
her
utter
weariness
longed
to
feel
that
warmth
again
though
she
scarcely
realized
it
she
wanted
the
clasp
of
motherly
arms
shielding
her
from
the
tempest
of
life
tommy
who
had
met
her
at
rawal
pindi
on
the
dreadful
return
journey
had
watched
over
her
and
cared
for
her
comfort
with
the
utmost
tenderness
but
tommy
like
peter
was
somehow
outside
her
confidence
he
was
just
a
blundering
male
with
the
best
intentions
she
could
not
have
opened
her
heart
to
him
had
she
tried
she
was
unspeakably
glad
to
have
him
with
her
and
later
on
she
hoped
to
join
him
again
at
the
green
bungalow
down
at
kurrumpore
where
they
had
dwelt
together
during
the
weeks
preceding
her
marriage
for
tommy
was
the
only
relative
she
had
in
the
world
who
cared
for
her
and
she
was
very
fond
of
tommy
but
she
was
not
really
intimate
with
him
they
were
just
good
comrades
as
a
married
woman
she
no
longer
feared
the
veiled
shafts
of
malice
that
had
pierced
her
before
her
position
was
assured
not
that
she
would
have
cared
greatly
in
any
case
such
trivial
things
belonged
to
the
past
and
she
marvelled
now
at
the
thought
that
they
had
ever
seriously
affected
her
she
was
changed
greatly
changed
in
one
short
month
she
had
left
her
girlhood
behind
her
her
proud
shyness
had
utterly
departed
she
had
returned
a
grave
reserved
woman
indifferent
almost
apathetic
wholly
her
natural
stateliness
still
clung
about
her
but
she
did
not
cloak
herself
therewith
she
walked
rather
as
one
rapt
in
reverie
looking
neither
to
the
right
nor
to
the
left
ralston
nearly
wept
when
she
saw
her
so
shocked
was
she
by
the
havoc
that
strange
month
had
wrought
all
the
soft
glow
of
youth
had
utterly
passed
away
white
and
cold
as
alabaster
a
woman
empty
and
alone
she
returned
from
the
forbidden
paradise
and
it
seemed
to
ralston
at
first
that
the
very
heart
of
her
had
been
shattered
like
a
beautiful
flower
by
the
closing
of
the
gates
but
later
when
stella
had
been
with
her
for
a
few
hours
she
realized
that
life
still
throbbed
deep
down
below
the
surface
though
perhaps
in
it
was
buried
deep
very
far
from
the
reach
of
all
casual
investigation
she
could
not
speak
of
her
tragedy
but
she
responded
to
the
mute
sympathy
ralston
poured
out
to
her
with
a
gratitude
that
was
wholly
unfeigned
and
the
latter
understood
clearly
that
she
would
not
refuse
her
admittance
though
she
barred
out
all
the
world
beside
she
was
deeply
touched
by
the
discovery
reflecting
in
her
humility
that
stella
need
must
indeed
have
been
great
to
have
drawn
her
to
herself
for
comfort
it
was
true
that
nearly
all
her
friends
had
been
made
in
trouble
which
she
had
sought
to
alleviate
but
mary
ralston
was
too
lowly
to
ascribe
to
herself
any
virtue
on
that
account
she
only
thanked
god
for
her
opportunities
on
the
night
of
their
arrival
when
stella
had
gone
to
her
room
tommy
spoke
very
seriously
of
his
sister
state
and
begged
ralston
to
do
her
utmost
to
combat
the
apathy
which
he
had
found
himself
wholly
unable
to
pierce
i
have
seen
her
shed
a
single
tear
he
said
people
who
know
would
think
her
heartless
i
ca
bear
to
see
that
deadly
coldness
it
is
stella
we
must
be
patient
ralston
said
there
were
tears
in
the
boy
own
eyes
for
which
she
liked
him
but
she
did
not
encourage
him
to
further
confidence
it
was
not
her
way
to
discuss
any
friend
with
a
third
person
however
intimate
tommy
left
the
subject
without
realizing
that
she
had
turned
him
from
it
i
do
know
in
the
least
how
she
is
left
he
said
restlessly
have
an
idea
what
sort
of
state
dacre
affairs
were
in
i
ought
to
have
asked
him
but
i
never
had
the
chance
and
everything
was
done
in
such
a
mighty
hurry
i
do
suppose
he
had
much
to
leave
if
anything
it
was
a
fool
marriage
he
ended
bitterly
i
always
hated
it
monck
knew
that
does
captain
monck
know
anything
asked
ralston
oh
goodness
knows
monck
away
on
urgent
business
been
away
for
ever
so
long
now
i
have
seen
him
since
dacre
death
i
daresay
he
does
even
know
of
that
yet
he
had
to
go
home
i
suppose
he
is
on
his
way
back
again
now
i
hope
so
anyway
it
pretty
beastly
without
him
poor
tommy
ralston
sympathy
was
uppermost
again
it
been
a
tragic
business
altogether
but
let
us
be
thankful
we
have
dear
stella
safely
back
i
am
going
to
say
good
night
to
her
now
help
yourself
to
anything
you
want
she
went
and
tommy
stretched
himself
out
on
a
long
chair
with
a
sigh
of
discontent
over
things
in
general
he
had
had
no
word
from
monck
throughout
his
absence
and
this
was
almost
the
greatest
grievance
of
all
treading
softly
the
passage
that
led
to
stella
door
ralston
nearly
stumbled
over
a
crouching
figure
that
rose
up
swiftly
and
noiselessly
on
the
instant
and
resolved
itself
into
the
salaaming
person
of
peter
the
sikh
he
had
slept
across
stella
threshold
ever
since
her
bereavement
my
is
still
awake
he
told
her
with
a
touch
of
wistfulness
she
sleeps
only
when
the
night
is
nearly
spent
and
you
sleep
at
her
door
queried
ralston
slightly
disconcerted
the
tall
form
bent
again
with
dignified
courtesy
that
is
my
privilege
said
peter
the
great
he
smiled
mournfully
and
made
way
for
her
to
pass
ralston
knocked
and
heard
a
low
voice
speak
in
answer
what
is
it
peter
softly
she
opened
the
door
it
is
i
my
dear
are
you
in
bed
may
i
come
and
bid
you
good
night
of
course
stella
made
instant
reply
how
good
you
are
how
kind
a
shaded
was
burning
by
her
side
her
face
upon
the
pillow
was
in
deep
shadow
her
hair
spread
all
around
her
wrapping
her
as
it
were
in
mystery
as
ralston
drew
near
she
stretched
out
a
welcoming
hand
i
hope
my
did
startle
you
she
said
the
dear
fellow
is
so
upset
that
i
do
want
an
he
is
doing
his
best
to
turn
himself
into
one
i
could
bear
to
send
him
away
you
do
mind
my
dear
i
mind
nothing
ralston
stooped
in
her
warm
way
and
kissed
the
pale
still
face
are
you
comfortable
have
you
everything
you
want
everything
thank
you
stella
answered
drawing
her
hostess
gently
down
to
sit
on
the
side
of
the
bed
i
feel
rested
already
somehow
your
presence
is
restful
oh
my
dear
ralston
flushed
with
pleasure
not
many
were
the
compliments
that
came
her
way
and
you
feel
as
if
you
will
be
able
to
sleep
stella
eyes
looked
unutterably
weary
yet
she
shook
her
head
no
i
never
sleep
much
before
morning
i
think
i
slept
too
much
when
i
was
in
kashmir
the
days
and
nights
all
seemed
part
of
one
long
dream
a
slight
shudder
assailed
her
she
repressed
it
with
a
shadowy
smile
life
here
will
be
very
different
she
said
perhaps
i
shall
be
able
to
wake
up
now
i
am
not
in
the
least
a
dreamy
person
as
a
rule
the
quick
tears
sprang
to
ralston
eyes
she
stroked
stella
hand
without
speaking
i
wanted
to
go
back
to
kurrumpore
with
tommy
stella
went
on
but
he
wo
hear
of
it
though
he
tells
me
that
you
stayed
there
through
last
summer
if
you
could
stand
it
so
could
i
feel
sure
that
physically
i
am
much
stronger
oh
no
dear
no
you
could
do
it
ralston
looked
down
upon
the
beautiful
face
very
tenderly
i
am
tough
you
know
dried
up
and
wiry
and
i
had
a
very
strong
motive
but
you
are
different
you
would
never
stand
a
hot
season
at
kurrumpore
i
ca
tell
you
what
it
is
like
there
at
its
worst
it
is
unspeakable
i
am
very
glad
that
tommy
realizes
the
impossibility
of
it
no
no
stay
here
with
me
till
i
go
down
i
am
always
the
first
and
it
will
give
me
so
much
pleasure
to
take
care
of
you
stella
relinquished
the
discussion
with
a
short
sigh
it
does
seem
to
matter
much
what
i
do
she
said
tommy
certainly
does
need
me
no
one
does
and
i
expect
you
will
soon
get
very
tired
of
me
never
dear
never
ralston
hand
clasped
hers
reassuringly
never
think
that
for
a
moment
from
the
very
first
day
i
saw
you
i
have
wanted
to
have
you
to
love
and
care
for
a
gleam
of
surprise
crossed
stella
face
how
very
kind
of
you
she
said
oh
no
dear
it
was
your
own
doing
you
are
so
beautiful
murmured
the
surgeon
wife
and
i
knew
that
you
were
the
same
all
through
beautiful
to
the
very
soul
oh
do
say
that
sharply
stella
broke
in
upon
her
do
think
it
you
do
know
me
in
the
least
you
you
have
far
more
beauty
of
soul
than
i
have
or
can
ever
hope
to
have
now
ralston
shook
her
head
but
it
is
so
stella
insisted
i
what
am
i
a
tremor
of
passion
crept
unawares
into
her
low
voice
i
am
a
woman
who
has
been
denied
everything
i
have
been
cast
out
like
eve
but
without
compensations
if
i
had
been
given
a
child
to
love
i
might
have
had
hope
but
now
i
have
none
i
have
none
i
am
hard
and
bitter
old
before
my
time
and
i
shall
never
now
be
anything
else
oh
darling
no
very
swiftly
ralston
checked
her
indeed
you
are
wrong
we
can
make
of
our
lives
what
we
will
believe
me
the
barren
woman
can
be
a
joyful
mother
of
children
if
she
will
there
is
always
someone
to
love
stella
lips
were
quivering
she
turned
her
face
aside
life
is
very
difficult
she
said
it
gets
simpler
as
one
goes
on
dear
ralston
assured
her
gently
not
easy
oh
no
not
easy
we
were
never
meant
to
make
an
of
circumstance
however
favourable
but
if
we
only
press
on
it
does
get
simpler
and
the
way
opens
out
before
us
as
we
go
i
have
learnt
that
at
least
from
life
she
paused
a
moment
then
bent
suddenly
down
and
spoke
into
stella
ear
may
i
tell
you
something
about
myself
something
i
have
never
before
breathed
to
any
one
except
to
god
stella
turned
instantly
yes
tell
me
she
murmured
back
clasping
closely
the
thin
hand
that
had
so
tenderly
stroked
her
own
ralston
hesitated
a
second
as
one
who
pauses
before
making
a
supreme
effort
then
under
her
breath
she
spoke
again
perhaps
it
will
not
interest
you
much
i
do
know
it
is
only
this
like
you
i
wanted
i
hoped
for
a
child
and
i
married
without
loving
just
for
that
stella
my
sin
was
punished
the
baby
came
and
went
and
there
can
never
be
another
i
thought
my
heart
was
broken
at
the
time
oh
it
was
bitter
bitter
even
now
sometimes
she
stopped
herself
but
no
i
need
trouble
you
with
that
i
only
want
to
tell
you
that
very
beautiful
flowers
bloom
sometimes
out
of
ashes
and
it
has
been
so
with
me
my
rose
of
love
was
slow
in
growing
but
it
blossoms
now
and
i
am
training
it
over
all
the
blank
spaces
and
it
grew
out
of
a
barren
soil
dear
out
of
a
barren
soil
stella
arms
were
close
about
her
as
she
finished
oh
thank
you
she
whispered
tremulously
thank
you
for
telling
me
that
but
though
she
was
deeply
stirred
no
further
confidence
could
she
bring
herself
to
utter
she
had
found
a
friend
a
close
staunch
friend
who
would
never
fail
her
but
not
even
to
her
could
she
show
the
blackness
of
the
gulf
into
which
she
had
been
hurled
even
now
there
were
times
when
she
seemed
to
be
still
falling
falling
and
always
waking
or
sleeping
the
nightmare
horror
of
it
clung
cold
about
her
soul
chapter
iii
the
barren
soil
no
one
could
look
askance
at
poor
ralph
dacre
young
widow
lady
harriet
mansfield
graciously
hinted
as
much
when
she
paid
her
state
call
within
a
week
of
her
arrival
also
she
desired
to
ascertain
plans
for
the
future
and
when
she
heard
that
she
intended
to
return
to
kurrumpore
with
ralston
she
received
the
news
with
a
species
of
condescending
approval
that
seemed
to
indicate
that
stella
days
of
probation
were
past
with
the
exercise
of
great
care
and
circumspection
she
might
even
ultimately
be
admitted
to
the
fortunate
circle
which
sunned
itself
in
the
light
of

tommy
elevated
his
nose
irreverently
when
the
august
presence
was
withdrawn
and
hoped
that
stella
would
not
have
her
head
turned
by
the
royal
favour
he
prophesied
that
burton
would
be
the
next
to
come
simpering
round
and
in
this
he
was
not
mistaken
but
stella
did
not
receive
this
visitor
for
on
the
following
day
she
was
in
bed
with
an
attack
of
fever
that
prostrated
her
during
the
rest
of
his
leave
it
was
not
a
dangerous
illness
and
ralston
nursed
her
through
it
with
a
devotion
that
went
far
towards
cementing
the
friendship
already
begun
between
them
tommy
though
regretful
consoled
himself
by
the
ready
means
of
the
station
gaieties
played
tennis
with
zest
inaugurated
a
gymkhana
and
danced
practically
every
night
into
the
early
morning
he
was
a
delightful
companion
for
little
tessa
ermsted
who
followed
him
everywhere
and
was
never
snubbed
an
inquiring
mind
notwithstanding
truly
a
nice
boy
was
tommy
as
everyone
agreed
and
the
regret
was
general
when
his
leave
began
to
draw
to
a
close
on
the
afternoon
of
his
last
day
he
made
his
appearance
on
the
verandah
of
the
grand
stand
for
tea
with
his
faithful
attendant
at
his
heels
to
find
his
sister
reclining
there
for
the
first
time
on
a
well
lined
with
cushions
while
ralston
presided
at
the
beside
her
she
looked
the
ghost
of
her
former
self
and
for
a
moment
though
he
had
visited
her
in
bed
only
that
morning
tommy
was
rudely
startled
great
jupiter
he
ejaculated
how
ill
you
look
she
smiled
at
his
exclamation
while
his
small
companion
pricked
up
attentive
ears
do
people
look
like
that
when
they
going
to
die
she
asked
not
in
the
least
dear
said
ralston
tranquilly
come
and
speak
to
dacre
and
tell
us
what
you
have
been
doing
but
tessa
would
only
stand
on
one
leg
and
stare
till
stella
put
forth
a
friendly
hand
and
beckoned
her
to
a
corner
of
her
she
went
then
still
staring
with
wide
round
eyes
of
intensest
blue
that
gazed
out
of
a
somewhat
pinched
little
face
of
intelligence
what
have
you
and
tommy
been
doing
stella
asked
oh
just
hobnobbing
said
tessa
same
as
mother
and
the
rajah
have
some
cake
said
tommy
and
tell
us
all
about
the
mongoose
oh
scooter
he
such
a
darling
shall
i
bring
him
to
see
you
asked
tessa
lifting
those
wonderful
unchildlike
eyes
of
hers
to
stella
you
love
him
i
know
you
would
he
talks
almost
captain
monck
gave
him
to
me
i
never
liked
him
before
but
i
do
now
i
wish
he
come
back
and
so
does
tommy
do
you
think
he
a
nice
man
i
do
know
him
very
well
said
stella
oh
do
you
that
because
he
so
quiet
i
used
to
think
he
was
surly
but
he
is
really
he
only
shy
is
he
aunt
mary
the
blue
eyes
whisked
round
to
ralston
and
were
met
by
a
slightly
reproving
shake
of
the
head
no
but
really
tessa
protested
he
is
a
nice
man
tommy
says
so
mother
does
like
him
but
that
nothing
to
go
by
the
people
she
likes
are
hardly
ever
nice
daddy
says
so
tessa
said
ralston
gently
we
do
want
to
hear
about
that
tell
us
some
more
about
captain
monck
mongoose
instead
tessa
frowned
momentarily
such
nursery
discipline
was
something
of
an
insult
to
her
eight
years
dignity
but
in
a
second
she
sent
a
dazzling
smile
to
her
hostess
accepting
the
rebuff
all
right
aunt
mary
bring
him
to
see
you
shall
i
she
said
brightly
dacre
will
like
that
too
it
be
something
to
amuse
us
when
tommy
gone
tommy
looked
across
with
a
grin
yes
keep
your
spirits
up
he
said
it
dull
work
with
the
boys
away
is
it
aunt
mary
and
scooter
is
a
most
sagacious
animal
almost
as
intelligent
as
peter
the
great
who
coils
himself
on
stella
threshold
every
night
as
if
he
thought
the
bogeyman
was
coming
to
spirit
her
away
he
developing
into
a
habit
is
he
stella
you
better
be
careful
stella
smiled
her
faint
tired
smile
i
like
to
have
him
there
she
said
i
am
not
nervous
of
course
but
he
is
a
friend
you
never
shake
him
off
predicted
tommy
he
comes
of
a
romantic
stock
hullo
here
is
his
high
mightiness
with
the
mail
look
at
the
sparkle
in
aunt
mary
eyes
did
you
ever
see
the
like
she
expects
to
draw
a
prize
evidently
he
stretched
a
leisurely
arm
and
took
the
letter
from
the
salver
that
the
indian
extended
it
was
for
ralston
and
she
received
it
blushing
like
an
eager
girl
why
does
aunt
mary
look
like
that
piped
tessa
ever
observant
only
from
the
major
mother
never
looks
like
that
when
daddy
writes
to
her
perhaps
daddy
letters
are
not
so
interesting
suggested
tommy
tessa
chuckled
shall
i
tell
you
what
she
ever
so
much
rather
have
a
letter
from
the
rajah
i
know
she
would
she
keeps
his
locked
up
but
she
never
bothers
about
daddy
i
ca
think
what
the
rajah
finds
to
write
about
when
they
are
always
meeting
i
think
it
silly
you
very
silly
said
tommy
i
hate
writing
letters
myself
beastly
dull
work
perhaps
you
will
excuse
me
while
i
read
mine
said
ralston
stella
smiled
at
her
oh
do
perhaps
there
will
be
some
interesting
news
of
kurrumpore
in
it
news
of
monck
perhaps
suggested
tommy
there
a
fellow
who
never
writes
a
letter
i
have
the
faintest
idea
where
he
is
or
what
he
is
doing
except
that
he
went
to
his
brother
somewhere
in
england
he
is
due
back
in
about
a
fortnight
but
i
probably
sha
hear
a
word
of
him
until
he
there
you
have
not
written
to
him
either
questioned
stella
i
could
i
did
know
where
to
write
tommy
eyes
met
hers
with
slight
hesitation
i
have
been
able
to
tell
him
anything
of
our
affairs
it
quite
possible
though
that
he
will
have
heard
before
he
gets
back
to
the
green
bungalow
he
generally
gets
hold
of
things
it
need
not
make
any
difference
stella
spoke
slowly
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
green
that
gleamed
in
the
sun
below
them
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
he
is
quite
welcome
to
remain
at
the
green
bungalow
i
daresay
we
should
not
get
in
each
other
way
that
is
she
looked
at
her
brother
if
you
prefer
that
arrangement
i
say
that
jolly
decent
of
you
tommy
face
was
flushed
with
pleasure
sure
you
mean
it
quite
sure
stella
spoke
rather
wearily
it
really
does
matter
to
me
except
that
i
do
want
to
come
between
you
and
your
friend
now
that
i
have
been
married
a
tinge
of
bitterness
sounded
in
her
voice
i
suppose
no
one
will
take
exception
but
of
course
captain
monck
may
see
the
matter
in
a
different
light
if
so
pray
let
him
do
as
he
thinks
fit
you
bet
he
will
said
tommy
he
about
the
most
determined
cuss
that
ever
lived
he
a
very
nice
man
put
in
tessa
jealously
tommy
laughed
he
one
of
the
best
he
agreed
heartily
and
he
the
sort
that
always
comes
out
on
top
sooner
or
later
just
you
remember
that
tessa
he
a
winner
and
he
straight
straight
as
a
die
which
is
all
that
matters
said
ralston
without
lifting
her
eyes
from
her
letter
hear
hear
said
tommy
why
do
you
look
like
that
stella
mean
to
say
he
is
straight
i
did
say
anything
stella
still
spoke
wearily
albeit
she
was
faintly
smiling
i
was
only
wondering
wondering
what
tommy
voice
had
a
hint
of
sharpness
he
looked
momentarily
aggressive
just
wondering
how
much
you
knew
of
him
that
all
she
made
answer
i
know
as
much
as
any
one
asserted
tommy
quickly
he
a
man
to
be
honoured
i
stake
my
life
on
that
he
is
incapable
of
anything
mean
or
underhand
stella
was
silent
the
boy
faith
was
genuine
she
knew
but
remembering
what
ralph
dacre
had
told
her
on
their
last
night
together
she
could
not
stifle
the
wonder
as
to
whether
tommy
had
ever
grasped
the
actual
quality
of
his
friend
character
it
seemed
to
her
that
worship
was
of
too
humble
a
species
to
afford
him
a
very
comprehensive
view
of
the
object
thereof
she
was
sure
that
unlike
herself
he
would
never
presume
to
criticize
would
never
so
much
as
question
any
action
of
monck
her
own
conception
of
the
man
she
was
aware
had
altered
somewhat
since
that
night
she
regarded
him
now
with
a
wholly
dispassionate
interest
she
had
attracted
him
but
she
much
doubted
if
the
attraction
had
survived
her
marriage
for
herself
that
chapter
in
her
life
was
closed
and
could
never
she
now
believed
be
reopened
monck
had
gone
his
way
she
hers
and
they
had
drifted
apart
only
by
the
accident
of
circumstance
would
they
meet
again
and
she
was
determined
that
when
this
meeting
took
place
their
relations
should
be
of
so
impersonal
a
character
that
he
should
find
it
impossible
to
recall
the
fact
that
any
hint
of
romance
had
ever
hovered
even
for
a
fleeting
moment
between
them
he
had
his
career
before
him
he
followed
the
way
of
ambition
and
he
should
continue
to
follow
it
unhindered
by
any
thought
of
her
she
was
dependent
upon
no
man
she
would
pick
up
the
threads
of
her
own
life
and
weave
of
it
something
that
should
be
worth
while
with
the
return
of
health
this
resolution
was
forming
within
her
ralston
influence
was
making
itself
felt
she
believed
that
the
way
would
open
out
before
her
as
she
went
she
had
made
one
great
mistake
she
would
never
make
such
another
she
would
be
patient
it
might
be
in
time
that
to
her
even
as
to
her
friend
a
blossoming
might
come
out
of
the
barren
soil
in
which
her
life
was
cast
chapter
iv
the
summons
during
those
months
spent
at
bhulwana
with
the
surgeon
wife
a
measure
of
peace
did
gradually
return
to
stella
she
took
no
part
in
the
gaieties
of
the
station
but
her
widow
mourning
made
it
easy
for
her
to
hold
aloof
undoubtedly
she
earned
lady
harriet
approval
by
so
doing
but
ermsted
continued
to
look
at
her
askance
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
her
small
daughter
had
developed
a
warm
liking
for
the
sister
of
her
beloved
tommy
wait
till
she
gets
back
to
kurrumpore
said
ermsted
we
shall
see
her
in
her
true
colours
then
she
did
not
say
this
to
ralston
she
visited
the
grand
stand
less
and
less
frequently
she
was
always
full
of
engagements
and
seldom
had
a
moment
to
spare
for
the
society
of
this
steady
friend
of
hers
and
ralston
never
sought
her
out
it
was
not
her
way
she
was
ready
for
all
but
she
intruded
upon
none
ralston
affection
for
stella
had
become
very
deep
there
was
between
them
a
sympathy
that
was
beyond
words
they
understood
each
other
as
the
wet
season
drew
on
their
companionship
became
more
and
more
intimate
though
their
spoken
confidences
were
few
ralston
never
asked
for
confidences
though
she
probably
received
more
than
any
other
woman
in
the
station
it
was
on
a
day
in
september
of
drifting
clouds
and
unbroken
rain
that
stella
spoke
at
length
of
a
resolution
that
had
been
gradually
forming
in
her
mind
she
found
no
difficulty
in
speaking
in
fact
it
seemed
the
natural
thing
to
do
and
she
felt
even
as
she
gave
utterance
to
the
words
that
ralston
already
knew
their
import
mary
she
said
after
christmas
i
am
going
back
to
england
ralston
betrayed
no
surprise
she
was
in
the
midst
of
an
elaborate
darn
in
the
heel
of
a
silk
sock
she
looked
across
at
stella
gravely
and
when
you
get
there
my
dear
she
said
i
shall
find
some
work
to
do
stella
spoke
with
the
decision
of
one
who
gives
utterance
to
the
result
of
careful
thought
i
think
i
shall
go
in
for
hospital
training
it
is
hard
work
i
know
but
i
am
strong
i
think
hard
work
is
what
i
need
ralston
was
silent
stella
went
on
i
see
now
that
i
made
a
mistake
in
ever
coming
out
here
it
was
as
if
tommy
really
wanted
me
he
does
you
know
his
friend
captain
monck
is
and
probably
better
for
him
in
any
case
he
does
need
me
you
may
be
right
dear
ralston
said
though
i
doubt
if
tommy
would
view
it
in
the
same
light
i
am
glad
anyhow
that
you
will
spend
christmas
out
here
i
shall
not
lose
you
so
soon
stella
smiled
a
little
i
do
want
to
hurt
tommy
feelings
and
i
know
they
would
be
hurt
if
i
went
sooner
besides
i
would
like
to
have
one
cold
weather
out
here
and
why
not
said
ralston
she
added
after
a
moment
what
will
you
do
with
peter
stella
hesitated
that
is
one
reason
why
i
have
not
come
to
a
decision
sooner
i
do
like
leaving
poor
peter
it
occurred
to
me
possibly
that
down
at
kurrumpore
he
might
find
another
master
anyway
i
shall
tell
him
my
plans
when
i
get
there
and
he
will
have
the
opportunity
she
smiled
rather
sadly
to
transfer
his
devotion
to
someone
else
he
wo
take
it
said
ralston
with
conviction
the
fidelity
of
these
men
is
amazing
it
puts
us
to
shame
i
hate
the
thought
of
parting
with
him
stella
said
but
what
can
i
do
she
broke
off
short
as
the
subject
of
their
discussion
came
softly
into
the
room
salver
in
hand
he
gave
her
a
telegram
and
stood
back
decorously
behind
her
chair
while
she
opened
it
ralston
grave
eyes
watched
her
and
in
a
moment
stella
looked
up
and
met
them
from
kurrumpore
she
said
her
face
was
pale
but
her
hands
and
voice
were
steady
from
tommy
questioned
ralston
no
from
captain
monck
tommy
is
ill
very
malaria
again
he
thinks
i
had
better
go
to
him
oh
my
dear
ralston
exclamation
held
dismay
stella
met
it
by
holding
out
to
her
the
message
tommy
down
with
malaria
it
said
condition
serious
come
if
you
are
able
monck
ralston
rose
she
seemed
to
be
more
agitated
than
stella
i
shall
go
too
she
said
no
dear
no
stella
stopped
her
there
is
no
need
for
that
i
shall
be
all
right
i
am
perfectly
strong
now
stronger
than
you
are
and
they
say
malaria
never
attacks
newcomers
so
badly
no
i
will
go
alone
i
wo
be
answerable
to
your
husband
for
you
really
dear
really
i
am
in
earnest
her
insistence
prevailed
albeit
ralston
yielded
very
unwillingly
she
was
not
very
strong
and
she
knew
well
that
her
husband
would
be
greatly
averse
to
her
taking
such
a
step
but
the
thought
of
stella
going
alone
was
even
harder
to
face
till
her
look
suddenly
fell
upon
peter
the
great
standing
motionless
behind
her
chair
ah
well
you
will
have
peter
she
said
with
relief
and
stella
who
was
bending
already
over
her
reply
telegram
replied
instantly
with
one
of
her
rare
smiles
of
course
i
shall
have
peter
peter
responding
smile
was
good
to
see
i
will
take
care
of
my
he
said
stella
reply
was
absolutely
simple
starting
at
once
she
wrote
and
within
half
an
hour
her
preparations
were
complete
she
knew
monck
well
enough
to
be
certain
that
he
would
not
have
telegraphed
that
urgent
message
had
not
the
need
been
great
he
had
nursed
tommy
once
before
and
she
knew
that
in
tommy
estimation
at
least
he
had
been
the
means
of
saving
his
life
he
was
a
man
of
steady
nerve
and
level
judgment
he
would
not
have
sent
for
her
if
his
faith
in
his
own
powers
had
not
begun
to
weaken
it
meant
that
tommy
was
very
ill
that
he
might
be
dying
all
that
was
great
in
stella
rose
up
impulsively
at
the
call
tommy
had
never
really
wanted
her
before
to
ralston
who
at
the
last
stood
over
her
with
a
glass
of
wine
she
was
as
a
different
woman
there
was
nothing
headlong
about
her
but
the
quiet
energy
of
her
made
her
realize
that
she
had
been
fashioned
for
better
things
than
the
social
gaieties
with
which
so
many
were
content
stella
would
go
to
the
deep
heart
of
life
she
yearned
to
accompany
her
upon
her
journey
to
the
plains
but
stella
solemn
promise
to
send
for
her
if
she
were
taken
ill
herself
consoled
her
in
a
measure
very
regretfully
did
she
take
leave
of
her
and
when
the
rattle
of
the
wheels
that
bore
stella
and
the
faithful
peter
away
had
died
at
last
in
the
distance
she
turned
back
into
her
empty
bungalow
with
tears
in
her
eyes
stella
had
become
dear
to
her
as
a
sister
it
was
an
journey
and
only
a
part
of
it
could
be
accomplished
by
train
the
line
ending
at
khanmulla
which
was
reached
in
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
but
for
peter
ministrations
stella
would
probably
have
fared
ill
but
he
was
an
experienced
traveller
and
surrounded
her
with
every
comfort
that
he
could
devise
the
night
was
close
and
dank
they
travelled
through
pitch
darkness
stella
lay
back
and
tried
to
sleep
but
sleep
would
not
come
to
her
she
was
tired
but
repose
eluded
her
the
beating
of
the
unceasing
rain
upon
the
tin
roof
and
the
perpetual
rattle
of
the
train
made
an
endless
tattoo
in
her
brain
from
which
there
was
no
escape
she
was
haunted
by
the
memory
of
the
last
journey
that
she
had
made
along
that
line
when
leaving
kurrumpore
in
the
spring
of
ralph
and
the
passion
in
his
eyes
of
the
first
wild
revolt
within
her
which
she
had
so
barely
quelled
how
far
away
seemed
those
days
of
an
almost
unbelievable
torture
she
could
regard
them
now
dispassionately
albeit
with
wonder
she
marvelled
now
that
she
had
ever
given
herself
to
such
a
man
by
the
light
of
experience
she
realized
how
tragic
had
been
her
blunder
and
now
that
the
awful
sense
of
shock
and
desolation
had
passed
she
could
be
thankful
that
no
heavier
penalty
had
been
exacted
the
man
had
been
taken
swiftly
mercifully
as
she
believed
he
had
been
spared
much
and
she
she
had
been
delivered
from
a
fate
far
worse
for
she
could
never
have
come
to
love
him
she
was
certain
of
that
lifelong
misery
would
have
been
her
portion
school
herself
to
submission
though
she
might
she
believed
that
the
awakening
from
that
dream
of
lethargy
could
not
have
been
long
deferred
for
either
of
them
and
with
it
would
have
come
a
bitterness
immeasurable
she
did
not
think
he
had
ever
honestly
believed
that
she
loved
him
but
at
least
he
had
never
guessed
at
the
actual
repulsion
with
which
at
times
she
had
been
filled
she
was
thankful
to
think
that
he
could
never
know
that
now
thankful
that
now
she
had
come
into
her
womanhood
it
was
all
her
own
she
valued
her
freedom
almost
extravagantly
since
it
had
been
given
back
to
her
and
she
also
valued
the
fact
that
in
no
worldly
sense
was
she
the
richer
for
having
been
ralph
dacre
wife
he
had
had
no
private
means
and
she
was
thankful
that
this
was
so
she
could
not
have
endured
to
reap
any
benefit
from
what
she
now
regarded
as
a
sin
she
had
borne
her
punishment
she
had
garnered
her
experience
and
now
she
walked
once
more
with
unshackled
feet
and
though
all
her
life
she
would
carry
the
marks
of
the
chain
that
had
galled
her
she
had
travelled
far
enough
to
realize
and
be
thankful
for
her
liberty
the
train
rattled
on
through
the
night
anxiety
came
at
first
drifting
into
her
busy
brain
she
had
hardly
had
time
to
be
anxious
in
the
rush
of
preparation
and
departure
but
restlessness
paved
the
way
she
began
to
ask
herself
with
growing
uneasiness
what
could
be
awaiting
her
at
the
end
of
the
journey
the
summons
had
been
so
clear
and
imperative
her
first
thought
her
instinct
had
been
to
obey
till
the
enforced
inaction
of
this
train
journey
she
had
not
had
time
to
feel
the
gnawing
torture
of
suspense
but
now
it
came
and
racked
her
the
thought
of
tommy
and
his
need
became
paramount
did
he
know
that
she
was
hastening
to
him
she
wondered
or
had
he
had
he
already
passed
beyond
her
reach
men
passed
so
quickly
in
this
tropical
wilderness
the
solemn
music
of
an
anthem
she
had
known
and
loved
in
the
old
days
of
her
girlhood
rose
and
surged
through
her
she
found
herself
repeating
the
words
our
life
is
but
a
shadow
so
soon
passeth
it
away
and
we
are
gone
so
soon
so
soon
the
repetition
of
those
last
words
rang
like
a
knell
but
tommy
she
could
not
think
of
tommy
eager
young
life
passing
so
those
words
were
written
for
the
old
and
weary
but
for
such
as
tommy
a
thousand
times
no
he
was
surely
too
ardent
too
full
of
life
to
pass
so
she
felt
as
if
he
were
years
younger
than
herself
and
then
another
thought
came
to
her
a
curious
haunting
thought
was
the
nemesis
that
had
overtaken
her
in
the
forbidden
paradise
yet
pursuing
her
with
relentless
persistence
was
the
measure
of
her
punishment
not
yet
complete
did
some
further
vengeance
still
follow
her
in
the
wilderness
of
her
desolation
she
tried
to
fling
the
thought
from
her
but
it
clung
like
an
evil
dream
she
could
not
wholly
shake
off
the
impression
that
it
had
made
upon
her
slowly
the
night
wore
away
the
heat
was
intense
she
felt
as
if
she
were
sitting
in
a
tank
of
steaming
vapour
the
oppression
of
the
atmosphere
was
like
a
physical
weight
and
ever
the
rain
beat
down
rattling
incessant
upon
the
tin
roof
above
her
head
she
thought
of
nemesis
again
nemesis
wielding
an
iron
flail
that
never
missed
its
mark
there
was
something
terrible
to
her
in
this
perpetual
beating
of
rain
she
had
never
imagined
anything
like
it
it
was
in
the
dark
of
the
early
morning
that
she
began
at
last
to
near
her
destination
a
drive
through
the
jungle
awaited
her
she
knew
she
wondered
if
monck
had
made
provision
for
this
or
if
all
arrangements
would
be
left
in
peter
capable
hands
she
had
never
felt
more
thankful
for
this
trusty
servant
of
hers
than
now
with
the
loneliness
and
darkness
of
this
unfamiliar
world
hedging
her
round
she
felt
almost
as
one
in
a
hostile
country
and
even
the
thought
of
tommy
and
his
need
could
not
dispel
the
impression
the
train
rattled
into
the
little
station
of
khanmulla
the
rainfall
seemed
to
increase
as
they
stopped
it
was
like
the
beating
of
rods
upon
the
there
came
the
usual
hubbub
of
discordant
cries
but
in
foreign
voices
and
in
a
foreign
tongue
stella
gathered
her
property
together
in
readiness
for
peter
then
she
turned
somewhat
stiff
after
her
long
journey
and
found
the
door
already
swinging
open
and
a
man
broad
shoulders
blocking
the
opening
how
do
you
do
said
monck
she
started
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
his
face
was
in
the
shadow
but
in
a
moment
his
features
dark
and
dominant
flashed
to
her
memory
she
bent
to
him
swiftly
with
outstretched
hand
how
good
of
you
to
meet
me
how
is
tommy
he
held
her
hand
for
an
instant
and
she
was
aware
of
a
sharp
tingling
throughout
her
being
as
though
by
means
of
that
strong
grasp
he
had
imparted
strength
he
is
about
as
bad
as
a
man
can
be
he
said
ralston
has
been
with
him
all
night
i
borrowed
his
to
fetch
you
do
waste
any
time
her
heart
gave
a
throb
of
dismay
the
brief
words
were
as
as
the
rain
they
demanded
no
answer
and
she
made
none
only
instant
submission
and
that
she
gave
she
had
a
glimpse
of
peter
tall
form
standing
behind
monck
and
to
him
for
a
moment
she
turned
as
she
descended
you
will
see
to
everything
she
said
you
will
follow
leave
all
to
me
my
he
said
deeply
bowing
and
she
took
him
at
his
word
monck
had
a
military
overcoat
on
his
arm
in
which
he
wrapped
her
before
they
left
the
ralston
little
car
shed
dazzling
beams
of
light
through
the
dripping
dark
she
floundered
blindly
into
a
pool
of
water
before
she
reached
it
and
was
doubly
startled
by
monck
lifting
her
bodily
without
apology
out
of
the
mire
and
placing
her
on
the
seat
the
beat
of
the
rain
upon
the
hood
made
her
wonder
if
they
could
make
any
headway
under
it
and
then
while
she
was
still
wondering
the
engine
began
to
throb
like
a
living
thing
and
she
was
aware
of
monck
squeezing
past
her
to
his
seat
at
the
wheel
he
did
not
speak
but
he
wrapped
the
rug
firmly
about
her
and
almost
before
she
had
time
to
thank
him
they
were
in
motion
that
was
one
of
the
wildest
experiences
that
she
had
ever
known
monck
went
like
the
wind
the
road
wound
through
the
jungle
and
in
many
places
was
little
more
than
a
rough
track
the
car
bumped
and
jolted
and
seemed
to
cry
aloud
for
mercy
but
monck
did
not
spare
and
stella
crouched
beside
him
too
full
of
wonder
to
be
afraid
they
emerged
from
the
jungle
at
length
and
ran
along
an
open
road
between
wide
fields
of
rice
or
cotton
their
course
became
easier
and
stella
realized
that
they
were
nearing
the
end
of
their
journey
they
were
approaching
the
native
portion
of
kurrumpore
she
turned
to
the
silent
man
beside
her
is
tommy
expecting
me
she
asked
he
did
not
answer
her
immediately
then
he
was
practically
unconscious
when
i
left
he
said
he
put
on
speed
with
the
words
they
shot
forward
through
the
pelting
rain
at
a
terrific
pace
she
divined
that
his
anxiety
was
such
that
he
did
not
wish
to
talk
they
passed
through
the
native
quarter
as
if
on
wings
the
rain
fell
in
a
deluge
here
it
was
like
some
power
of
darkness
striving
to
beat
them
back
she
pictured
monck
face
grim
ruthless
forcing
his
way
through
the
opposing
element
the
man
himself
she
could
barely
see
and
then
almost
before
she
realized
it
they
were
in
the
european
cantonment
and
she
heard
the
grinding
of
the
brakes
as
they
reached
the
gate
of
the
green
bungalow
monck
turned
the
little
car
into
the
compound
and
a
light
shone
down
upon
them
from
the
verandah
the
car
came
to
a
standstill
do
you
mind
getting
out
first
said
monck
she
got
out
with
a
dazed
sense
of
unreality
he
followed
her
immediately
his
hand
hard
and
muscular
grasped
her
arm
he
led
her
up
the
wooden
steps
all
shining
and
slippery
in
the
rain
in
the
shelter
of
the
verandah
he
stopped
wait
here
a
moment
he
said
but
stella
turned
swiftly
detaining
him
no
no
she
said
i
am
coming
with
you
i
would
rather
know
at
once
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
without
remonstrance
and
stood
back
for
her
to
precede
him
later
it
seemed
to
her
that
it
was
the
most
merciful
thing
he
could
have
done
at
the
time
she
did
not
pause
to
thank
him
but
went
swiftly
past
taking
her
way
straight
along
the
verandah
to
tommy
room
the
window
was
open
and
a
bar
of
light
stretched
therefrom
like
a
fiery
sword
into
the
streaming
rain
just
for
a
second
that
gleaming
shaft
daunted
her
something
within
her
shrank
affrighted
then
aware
of
monck
immediately
behind
her
she
conquered
her
dread
and
entered
she
saw
that
the
bar
of
light
came
from
a
hooded
lamp
which
was
turned
towards
the
window
leaving
the
bed
in
shadow
over
the
latter
a
man
was
bending
he
straightened
himself
sharply
at
her
approach
and
she
recognized
major
ralston
and
then
she
had
reached
the
bed
and
all
the
love
in
her
heart
pulsed
forth
in
yearning
tenderness
as
she
stooped
tommy
she
said
my
darling
he
did
not
stir
in
answer
he
lay
like
a
figure
carved
in
marble
suddenly
the
rays
of
the
lamp
were
turned
upon
him
and
she
saw
that
his
face
was
livid
the
eyes
were
closed
and
sunken
a
terrible
misgiving
stabbed
her
almost
involuntarily
she
drew
back
in
the
same
moment
she
felt
monck
hands
upon
her
he
was
unbuttoning
the
overcoat
in
which
she
was
wrapped
she
stood
motionless
feeling
cold
powerless
strangely
dependent
upon
him
as
he
stripped
the
coat
back
from
her
shoulders
he
spoke
his
voice
very
measured
and
quiet
but
kind
also
even
soothing
do
give
up
he
said
we
pull
him
through
between
us
a
queer
little
thrill
went
through
her
again
she
felt
as
if
he
had
imparted
strength
she
turned
back
to
the
bed
major
ralston
was
on
the
other
side
across
that
silent
form
he
spoke
to
her
see
if
you
can
get
him
to
take
this
i
am
afraid
he
past
it
but
try
she
saw
that
he
was
holding
a
spoon
and
she
commanded
herself
and
took
it
from
him
she
wondered
at
the
steadiness
of
her
own
hand
as
she
put
it
to
the
white
unconscious
lips
they
were
rigidly
closed
and
for
a
few
moments
she
thought
her
task
was
hopeless
then
very
slowly
they
parted
she
slipped
the
spoon
between
the
silence
in
the
room
was
deathly
the
heat
intense
heavy
outside
the
rain
fell
monotonously
and
mingling
with
its
beating
she
heard
the
croaking
of
innumerable
frogs
neither
ralston
nor
monck
stirred
a
finger
they
were
watching
closely
with
bated
breath
tommy
breathing
was
wholly
imperceptible
but
in
that
long
long
pause
she
fancied
she
saw
a
slight
tremor
at
his
throat
then
the
liquid
that
had
been
in
the
spoon
began
to
trickle
out
at
the
corner
of
his
mouth
she
stood
up
turning
instinctively
to
the
man
beside
her
oh
it
no
use
she
said
hopelessly
he
bent
swiftly
forward
let
me
try
quick
ralston
have
it
ready
that
it
now
then
tommy
now
lad
he
had
taken
her
place
almost
before
she
knew
it
she
saw
him
stoop
with
absolute
assurance
and
slip
his
arm
under
the
boy
shoulders
inert
head
fell
back
against
him
but
she
saw
his
strong
right
hand
come
out
and
take
the
spoon
that
ralston
held
out
his
dark
face
was
bent
to
his
task
and
it
held
no
dismay
only
unswerving
determination
tommy
he
said
again
and
in
his
voice
was
a
certain
grim
tenderness
that
moved
her
oddly
sending
the
tears
to
her
eyes
before
she
could
check
them
tommy
wake
up
man
if
you
think
you
going
out
now
you
damn
well
mistaken
wake
up
do
you
hear
wake
up
and
swallow
this
stuff
there
you
got
it
now
swallow
do
you
hear
swallow
he
held
the
spoon
between
tommy
lips
till
it
was
emptied
of
every
drop
then
thrust
it
back
at
ralston
here
take
it
pour
out
some
more
now
tommy
lad

up
to
you
swallow
it
like
a
dear
fellow

your

you
thought
you
slope
while
my
back
was
turned
you
were
quick
enough
my
lad
you
got
to
come
back
there
was
a
strange
note
of
passion
in
his
voice
it
was
obvious
to
stella
that
he
had
utterly
forgotten
himself
in
the
gigantic
task
before
him
body
and
soul
were
bent
to
its
fulfillment
she
could
see
the
perspiration
running
down
his
face
she
stood
and
watched
thrilled
through
and
through
with
the
wonder
of
what
she
saw
for
at
the
call
of
that
curt
insistent
voice
tommy
moved
and
made
response
it
was
like
the
return
of
a
departing
spirit
he
came
out
of
that
deathly
inertia
he
opened
his
eyes
upon
monck
face
staring
up
at
him
with
an
expression
and
you
have
swallowed
that
stuff
yet
monck
reminded
him
get
rid
of
that
first
what
a
child
you
are
tommy
why
ca
you
behave
yourself
tommy
throat
worked
spasmodically
he
made
a
mighty
effort
and
succeeded
in
swallowing
then
through
lips
that
twitched
as
if
he
were
going
to
cry
weakly
he
spoke
hullo
hullo
you
old
bounder
hullo
said
monck
in
stern
rejoinder
a
nice
game
this
are
you
ashamed
of
yourself
you
ought
to
be
i
furious
with
you
do
you
know
that
do
care
a
damn
said
tommy
and
forced
his
quivering
lips
to
a
smile
you
will
presently
you
puppy
said
monck
witheringly
you
more
bother
than
you
worth
come
on
ralston

him
another
dose
tommy
you
hang
on
or
i
know
the
reason
why
there
you
little
ass
what
the
matter
with
you
for
tommy
smile
had
crumpled
into
an
expression
of
woe
in
spite
of
him
he
turned
his
face
into
monck
shoulder
piteously
striving
to
hide
his
weakness
feel
so
beastly
bad
he
whispered
all
right
old
fellow
all
right
i
know
monck
hand
was
on
his
head
soothing
caressing
comforting
stick
to
it
like
a
briton
pull
you
round

i
do
understand
what
but
you
got
to
do
your
bit
you
know
you
got
to
be
game
and
here
your
sister
waiting
to
lend
a
hand
come
all
the
way
to
this
filthy
hole
on
purpose
you
are
not
going
to
let
her
see
you
go
under
come
tommy
lad
the
tears
overflowed
down
stella
cheeks
she
dared
not
show
herself
but
fortunately
for
her
tommy
did
not
desire
it
monck
words
took
effect
upon
him
and
he
made
a
trembling
effort
to
pull
himself
together
do
let
her
see
me
like
this
he
murmured
i
be
better
presently
you
tell
her
old
chap
and
i
say
look
after
her
you
all
right
you
cuckoo
said
monck
chapter
v
the
morning
day
broke
upon
a
world
of
streaming
rain
stella
sat
before
a
meal
spread
in
the
and
wanly
watched
it
peter
hovered
near
her
she
had
a
suspicion
that
the
meal
was
somehow
of
his
contriving
but
how
he
had
arrived
she
had
not
the
least
idea
and
was
too
weary
to
ask
tommy
had
fallen
into
natural
sleep
and
ralston
had
persuaded
her
to
leave
him
in
his
care
for
a
while
promising
to
send
for
her
at
once
if
occasion
arose
she
had
left
monck
there
also
but
she
fancied
ralston
did
not
mean
to
let
him
stay
her
thoughts
dwelt
oddly
upon
monck
he
had
surprised
her
more
in
some
fashion
he
had
pierced
straight
through
her
armour
of
indifference
wholly
without
intention
he
had
imposed
his
personality
upon
her
he
had
made
her
recognize
him
as
a
force
that
counted
though
major
ralston
had
been
engaged
upon
the
same
task
she
realized
that
it
was
his
effort
alone
that
had
brought
tommy
back
and
she
saw
it
clearly
it
was
sheer
love
and
nought
else
that
had
obtained
the
mastery
this
man
whom
she
had
always
regarded
as
a
being
apart
grimly
too
ambitious
to
be
capable
of
more
than
a
passing
fancy
had
shown
her
something
in
his
soul
which
she
knew
to
be
divine
he
was
not
it
seemed
so
aloof
as
she
had
imagined
him
to
be
the
friendship
between
himself
and
tommy
was
not
the
affair
that
she
and
a
good
many
others
had
always
believed
it
he
cared
for
tommy
cared
very
deeply
somehow
that
fact
made
a
vast
difference
to
her
such
a
difference
as
seemed
to
reach
to
the
very
centre
of
her
being
she
felt
as
if
she
had
underrated
something
great
the
rush
of
the
rain
on
the
roof
of
the
verandah
seemed
to
make
coherent
thought
impossible
she
gazed
at
the
meal
before
her
and
wondered
if
she
could
bring
herself
to
partake
of
it
peter
had
put
everything
ready
to
her
hand
and
in
justice
to
him
she
felt
as
if
she
ought
to
make
the
attempt
but
a
leaden
weariness
was
upon
her
she
felt
more
inclined
to
sink
back
in
her
chair
and
sleep
there
came
a
sound
behind
her
and
she
was
aware
of
someone
entering
she
fancied
it
was
peter
returned
to
mark
her
progress
and
stretched
her
hand
to
the
but
ere
she
touched
it
she
knew
that
she
was
mistaken
she
turned
and
saw
monck
by
the
grey
light
of
the
morning
his
face
startled
her
she
had
never
seen
it
look
so
haggard
but
out
of
it
the
dark
eyes
shone
alert
and
indomitable
albeit
she
suspected
that
they
had
not
slept
for
many
hours
he
made
her
a
brief
bow
may
i
join
you
he
said
his
manner
was
formal
but
she
could
not
stand
on
her
dignity
with
him
at
that
moment
impulsively
almost
involuntarily
it
seemed
to
her
later
she
rose
offering
him
both
her
hands
captain
monck
she
said
you
are
splendid
words
and
action
were
alike
wholly
spontaneous
they
were
also
wholly
unexpected
she
saw
a
strange
look
flash
across
his
face
just
for
a
second
he
hesitated
then
he
took
her
hands
and
held
them
fast
ah
stella
he
said
with
the
name
his
eyes
kindled
his
weariness
vanished
as
darkness
vanishes
before
the
glare
of
electricity
he
drew
her
suddenly
and
swiftly
to
him
for
a
few
throbbing
seconds
stella
was
so
utterly
amazed
that
she
made
no
resistance
he
astounded
her
at
every
turn
this
man
and
yet
in
some
strange
and
vital
fashion
her
moods
responded
to
his
he
was
not
beyond
comprehension
or
even
sympathy
but
as
she
found
his
dark
face
close
to
hers
and
felt
his
eyes
scorch
her
like
a
flame
expediency
rather
than
dismay
urged
her
to
action
there
was
something
so
sublimely
natural
about
him
at
that
moment
that
she
could
not
feel
afraid
she
drew
back
from
him
gasping
oh
please
please
she
said
captain
monck
let
me
go
he
held
her
still
though
he
drew
her
no
closer
must
i
he
said
and
in
a
lower
voice
have
you
forgotten
how
once
in
this
very
room
you
told
me
that
i
had
come
to
you
too
late
and
now
the
last
words
seemed
to
vibrate
through
and
through
her
she
quivered
from
head
to
foot
she
could
not
meet
the
passion
in
his
eyes
but
desperately
she
strove
to
cope
with
it
ere
it
mounted
beyond
her
control
ah
no
i
have
forgotten
she
said
but
i
was
a
good
deal
younger
then
i
did
know
much
of
life
i
have
changed
i
have
changed
enormously
you
have
changed
in
that
respect
he
asked
her
and
she
heard
in
his
voice
that
note
of
stubbornness
which
she
had
heard
on
that
night
that
seemed
so
long
ago
the
night
before
her
marriage
she
freed
one
hand
from
his
hold
and
set
it
pleadingly
against
his
breast
that
is
a
difficult
question
to
answer
she
said
but
do
you
think
a
slave
would
willingly
go
back
into
servitude
when
once
he
has
felt
the
joy
of
freedom
is
that
what
marriage
means
to
you
he
said
she
bent
her
head
yes
but
still
he
did
not
let
her
go
stella
he
said
i
have
changed
since
that
night
she
trembled
again
but
she
spoke
no
word
nor
did
she
raise
her
eyes
he
went
on
slowly
quietly
almost
on
a
note
of
fatalism
it
is
beyond
the
bounds
of
possibility
that
i
should
change
i
loved
you
then
i
love
you
now
i
shall
go
on
loving
you
as
long
as
i
live
i
never
thought
it
possible
that
you
could
care
for
me
until
you
told
me
so
but
i
shall
not
ask
you
to
marry
me
so
long
as
the
thought
of
marriage
means
slavery
to
you
all
i
ask
is
that
you
will
not
hold
yourself
back
from
loving
me
that
you
will
not
be
afraid
to
be
true
to
your
own
heart
is
that
too
much
his
voice
was
steady
again
she
raised
her
eyes
and
met
his
look
the
passion
had
gone
out
of
it
but
the
dominance
remained
she
thrilled
again
to
the
mastery
that
had
held
tommy
back
from
death
for
a
moment
she
could
not
speak
then
as
he
waited
she
gathered
her
strength
to
answer
i
mean
to
be
true
she
said
rather
breathlessly
but
i
i
value
my
freedom
too
much
ever
to
marry
again
please
i
want
you
to
understand
that
you
must
think
of
me
in
that
way
you
encourage
hopes
that
can
never
be
fulfilled
a
faint
gleam
crossed
his
face
that
is
my
affair
he
said
oh
but
i
mean
it
quickly
she
broke
in
upon
him
i
am
in
earnest
i
am
in
earnest
it
would
be
right
of
me
to
let
you
imagine
to
let
you
think
she
faltered
suddenly
for
something
obstructed
her
utterance
the
next
moment
swiftly
she
covered
her
face
my
dear
he
said
he
led
her
back
to
the
table
and
made
her
sit
down
he
knelt
beside
her
his
arms
comfortingly
around
her
i
made
you
cry
he
said
you
worn
out
forgive
me
i
a
brute
to
worry
you
like
this
you
had
a
rotten
time
of
it
i
know
i
know
no
do
be
afraid
of
me
i
wo
say
another
word
just
lean
on
me
that
all
i
wo
let
you
down
i
swear
she
took
him
at
his
word
for
a
space
and
leaned
upon
him
for
she
had
no
alternative
she
was
weary
to
the
soul
of
her
her
strength
was
gone
but
gradually
his
strength
helped
her
to
recover
she
looked
up
at
length
with
a
quivering
smile
there
i
am
going
to
be
sensible
you
must
be
worn
out
too
i
can
see
you
are
sit
down
wo
you
and
let
us
forget
this
he
met
her
look
steadily
no
i
ca
forget
he
said
but
i
pester
you
i
do
believe
in
pestering
any
one
i
should
have
done
it
now
only
he
broke
off
faintly
smiling
it
all
tommy
fault
confound
him
he
said
and
rose
giving
her
shoulder
a
pat
that
was
somehow
more
reassuring
to
her
than
any
words
she
laughed
rather
tremulously
poor
tommy
now
please
sit
down
and
have
a
rational
meal
you
are
looking
positively
gaunt
it
will
be
tommy
and
my
turn
to
nurse
you
next
if
you
are
not
careful
he
pulled
up
a
chair
and
seated
himself
what
a
pleasing
suggestion
but
i
doubt
if
tommy
assistance
will
be
very
valuable
to
any
one
for
some
little
time
to
come
no
milk
in
that
coffee
please
i
will
have
some
brandy
looking
back
upon
that
early
breakfast
stella
smiled
to
herself
though
not
without
misgiving
for
somehow
in
spite
of
what
had
preceded
it
it
was
a
very
affair
she
had
never
seen
monck
in
so
genial
a
mood
she
had
not
believed
him
capable
of
it
for
though
he
looked
wretchedly
ill
his
spirits
were
those
of
a
conqueror
doubtless
he
regarded
the
turn
in
tommy
illness
as
a
distinct
and
personal
victory
but
was
that
his
only
cause
for
triumph
she
wished
she
knew
chapter
vi
the
when
stella
saw
tommy
again
he
greeted
her
with
a
smile
of
welcome
that
told
her
that
for
him
the
worst
was
over
he
had
returned
but
his
weakness
was
great
greater
than
he
himself
realized
and
she
very
quickly
comprehended
the
reason
for
major
ralston
evident
anxiety
sickness
was
rife
everywhere
and
now
that
the
most
imminent
danger
was
past
he
was
able
to
spare
but
little
time
for
tommy
needs
he
placed
him
in
stella
care
with
many
repeated
injunctions
that
she
did
her
utmost
to
fulfil
for
the
first
two
days
monck
helped
her
his
management
of
tommy
was
supremely
arbitrary
and
tommy
submitted
himself
with
a
meekness
that
sometimes
struck
stella
as
excessive
but
it
was
so
evident
that
the
boy
loved
to
have
his
friend
near
him
whatever
his
mood
that
she
made
no
comments
since
monck
was
not
arbitrary
with
her
she
saw
but
little
of
him
after
their
early
morning
meal
together
for
when
he
could
spare
the
time
to
be
with
tommy
she
took
his
advice
and
went
to
her
room
for
the
rest
she
so
sorely
needed
she
hoped
that
monck
rested
too
during
the
hours
that
she
was
on
duty
in
the
she
concluded
that
he
did
so
though
his
appearance
gave
small
testimony
to
the
truth
of
her
supposition
once
or
twice
coming
upon
him
suddenly
she
was
positively
startled
by
the
haggardness
of
his
look
but
upon
this
also
she
made
no
comment
it
seemed
advisable
to
avoid
all
personal
matters
in
her
dealings
with
him
she
was
aware
that
he
suffered
no
interference
from
major
ralston
whose
time
was
in
fact
so
fully
occupied
at
the
hospital
and
elsewhere
that
he
was
little
likely
to
wish
to
add
him
to
his
sick
list
tommy
recovery
however
was
fairly
rapid
and
on
the
third
night
after
her
arrival
she
was
able
to
lie
down
in
his
room
and
rest
between
her
ministrations
ralston
professed
himself
well
satisfied
with
his
progress
in
the
morning
and
she
looked
forward
to
imparting
this
favourable
report
to
monck
but
monck
did
not
make
an
appearance
she
watched
for
him
almost
unconsciously
all
through
the
day
but
he
did
not
come
tommy
also
watched
for
him
and
finally
concluded
somewhat
discontentedly
that
he
had
gone
on
some
mission
regarding
which
he
had
not
deemed
it
advisable
to
inform
them
he
is
like
that
he
told
stella
and
for
the
first
time
he
spoke
almost
disparagingly
of
his
hero
so
beastly
discreet
he
never
thinks
any
one
can
keep
a
secret
besides
himself
ah
well
never
mind
stella
said
we
can
do
without
him
but
tommy
had
reached
the
stage
when
the
smallest
disappointment
was
a
serious
matter
he
fretted
and
grew
feverish
over
his
friend
absence
when
major
ralston
saw
him
that
evening
he
rated
him
soundly
and
even
stella
thought
seemed
inclined
to
blame
her
also
for
the
in
his
patient
condition
he
must
be
kept
quiet
he
insisted
it
is
absolutely
essential
or
we
shall
have
the
whole
trouble
over
again
i
shall
have
to
give
him
a
sedative
and
leave
him
to
you
i
ca
possibly
look
in
again
so
it
will
be
useless
to
send
for
me
you
will
have
to
manage
as
best
you
can
he
departed
and
stella
arranged
to
divide
the
with
peter
the
great
she
did
not
privately
believe
that
there
was
much
ground
for
alarm
but
in
view
of
the
doctor
very
emphatic
words
she
decided
to
spend
the
first
hours
by
tommy
side
peter
would
relieve
her
an
hour
after
midnight
when
at
his
earnest
request
she
promised
to
go
to
her
room
and
rest
the
sedative
very
speedily
took
effect
upon
tommy
and
he
slept
calmly
while
she
sat
beside
him
with
the
light
from
the
lamp
turned
upon
her
book
but
though
her
eyes
were
upon
the
open
page
her
attention
was
far
from
it
her
thoughts
had
wandered
to
monck
and
dwelt
persistently
upon
him
the
memory
of
that
last
conversation
she
had
had
with
ralph
dacre
would
not
be
excluded
from
her
brain
what
was
the
meaning
of
this
mysterious
absence
what
was
he
doing
she
felt
uneasy
even
troubled
there
was
something
about
this
secret
service
employment
which
made
her
shrink
though
she
felt
that
had
their
mutual
relations
been
of
the
totally
indifferent
and
casual
order
she
would
not
have
cared
it
seemed
to
her
impossible
to
place
any
real
confidence
in
a
man
who
deliberately
concealed
so
great
a
part
of
his
existence
her
instinct
was
to
trust
him
but
her
reason
forbade
she
was
beginning
to
ask
herself
if
it
would
not
be
advisable
to
leave
india
just
as
soon
as
tommy
could
spare
her
it
seemed
madness
to
remain
on
if
she
desired
to
avoid
any
increase
of
intimacy
with
this
man
who
had
already
so
far
overstepped
the
bounds
of
convention
in
his
dealing
with
her
and
yet
in
common
honesty
she
had
to
admit
it
she
did
not
want
to
go
the
attraction
that
held
her
was
as
yet
too
intangible
to
be
definitely
analyzed
but
she
could
not
deny
its
existence
she
did
not
love
the
man
oh
surely
she
did
not
love
him
for
she
did
not
want
to
marry
him
she
brought
her
feelings
to
that
touchstone
and
it
seemed
that
they
were
able
to
withstand
the
test
but
neither
did
she
want
to
cut
herself
finally
adrift
from
all
chance
of
contact
with
him
it
would
hurt
her
to
go
probably
almost
certainly
she
would
wish
herself
back
again
but
the
question
remained
unanswered
ought
she
to
stay
for
the
first
time
her
treasured
independence
arose
and
mocked
her
she
had
it
in
her
heart
to
wish
that
the
decision
did
not
rest
with
herself
it
was
at
this
point
while
she
was
yet
deep
in
her
meditations
that
a
slight
sound
at
the
window
made
her
look
up
it
was
almost
an
instinctive
movement
on
her
part
she
could
not
have
said
that
she
actually
heard
anything
besides
the
falling
rain
which
had
died
down
to
a
soft
patter
among
the
trees
in
the
compound
but
something
induced
her
took
up
and
so
doing
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
figure
on
the
verandah
without
that
sent
all
the
blood
in
her
body
racing
to
her
heart
it
was
but
a
momentary
glimpse
the
next
instant
it
was
gone
gone
like
a
shadow
so
that
she
found
herself
asking
breathlessly
if
it
had
ever
been
or
if
by
any
means
her
imagination
had
tricked
her
for
in
that
fleeting
second
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
past
had
opened
its
gates
to
reveal
to
her
a
figure
which
of
late
had
drifted
into
the
back
alleys
of
memory
the
figure
of
the
dreadful
old
native
who
in
some
vague
fashion
she
had
come
to
regard
as
the
cause
of
her
husband
death
she
had
never
seen
him
again
since
that
awful
morning
when
oblivion
had
caught
her
as
it
were
on
the
very
edge
of
the
world
but
for
long
after
he
had
haunted
her
dreams
so
that
the
very
thought
of
sleep
had
been
abhorrent
to
her
but
now
like
the
grim
ghost
of
that
strange
life
that
she
had
so
resolutely
thrust
behind
her
the
whole
revolting
personality
of
the
man
rushed
vividly
back
upon
her
she
sat
as
one
petrified
surely
surely
she
had
seen
him
in
the
flesh
it
could
not
have
been
a
dream
she
was
certain
that
she
had
not
slept
and
yet
how
had
that
horrible
old
kashmiri
beggar
come
all
these
hundreds
of
miles
from
his
native
haunts
it
was
not
likely
it
was
barely
possible
and
yet
she
had
always
been
convinced
that
in
some
way
he
had
known
her
husband
beforehand
had
he
come
then
of
set
intention
to
seek
her
out
perhaps
to
attempt
to
extract
money
from
her
she
could
not
answer
the
question
and
her
whole
being
shrank
from
the
thought
of
going
out
into
the
darkness
to
investigate
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
it
actually
she
dared
not
minutes
passed
she
sat
still
gazing
and
gazing
at
the
blank
darkness
of
the
window
nothing
moved
there
the
wild
beating
of
her
heart
died
gradually
down
surely
it
had
been
a
mistake
after
all
surely
she
had
fallen
into
a
doze
in
the
midst
of
her
reverie
and
dreamed
this
hateful
apparition
with
the
gleaming
eyes
and
famished
face
she
exerted
her
and
turned
at
last
to
look
at
tommy
he
was
sleeping
peacefully
with
his
head
on
his
arm
he
would
sleep
all
night
if
undisturbed
she
laid
aside
her
book
and
softly
rose
her
first
intention
was
to
go
to
the
door
and
see
if
peter
were
in
the
passage
but
the
very
fact
of
moving
seemed
to
give
her
courage
the
man
rest
would
be
short
enough
it
seemed
unkind
to
disturb
him
resolutely
she
turned
to
the
window
stifling
all
qualms
she
would
not
be
a
wretched
coward
she
would
see
for
herself
the
night
was
steaming
hot
and
there
was
a
smell
of
mildew
in
the
air
a
swarm
of
mosquitoes
buzzed
in
the
glare
thrown
by
the
lamp
with
a
shrill
attenuated
sound
like
the
skirl
of
bagpipes
a
creature
with
wings
flapped
with
a
monstrous
ungainliness
between
the
outer
posts
of
the
verandah
from
across
the
compound
an
owl
called
on
a
weird
note
of
defiance
and
in
the
dim
waste
of
distance
beyond
she
heard
the
piercing
cry
of
a
jackal
but
close
at
hand
so
far
as
the
rays
of
the
lamp
penetrated
she
could
discern
nothing
stay
what
was
that
a
bar
of
light
from
another
lamp
lay
across
the
verandah
stretching
out
into
the
darkness
it
came
from
the
room
next
to
the
one
in
which
she
stood
her
heart
gave
a
sudden
hard
throb
it
came
from
monck
room
that
meant
that
meant
what
did
it
mean
that
monck
had
returned
at
that
unusual
hour
or
that
there
really
was
a
native
intruder
who
had
found
the
window
unfastened
and
entered
again
the
impulse
to
retreat
and
call
peter
to
deal
with
the
situation
came
upon
her
but
almost
angrily
she
shook
it
off
she
would
see
for
herself
first
if
it
were
only
monck
then
her
fancy
had
indeed
played
her
false
and
no
one
should
know
it
if
it
were
any
one
else
it
would
be
time
enough
then
to
return
and
raise
the
alarm
so
reasoning
with
herself
seeking
to
reassure
herself
crying
shame
on
her
fear
she
stepped
noiselessly
forth
into
the
verandah
and
slipped
silent
as
that
shadow
had
been
through
the
intervening
space
of
darkness
to
the
open
window
of
monck
room
she
reached
it
was
blinded
for
a
moment
by
the
light
that
poured
through
it
then
recovering
peered
in
a
man
dressed
in
pyjamas
stood
facing
her
so
close
to
her
that
he
seemed
to
be
in
the
act
of
stepping
forth
she
recognized
him
in
a
second
it
was
monck
but
monck
as
she
never
before
had
seen
him
monck
with
eyes
alight
with
fever
and
lips
drawn
back
like
the
lips
of
a
snarling
animal
in
his
right
hand
he
gripped
a
revolver
he
saw
her
as
suddenly
as
she
saw
him
and
a
rapid
change
crossed
his
face
he
reached
out
and
caught
her
by
the
shoulder
come
in
come
in
he
said
his
words
rushing
over
each
other
in
a
confused
jumble
utterly
unlike
his
usual
incisive
speech
you
safe
in
here
i
shoot
the
brute
if
he
dares
to
come
near
you
again
she
saw
that
he
was
not
himself
the
awful
fire
in
his
eyes
alone
would
have
told
her
that
but
words
and
action
so
bewildered
her
that
she
yielded
to
the
compelling
grip
in
a
moment
she
was
in
the
room
and
he
was
closing
and
shuttering
the
window
with
fevered
haste
she
stood
and
watched
him
a
cold
sensation
beginning
to
creep
about
her
heart
when
he
turned
round
to
her
she
saw
that
he
was
smiling
a
fierce
triumphant
smile
he
threw
down
the
revolver
and
as
he
did
so
she
found
her
voice
captain
monck
what
does
that
man
want
what
what
is
he
doing
he
stood
looking
at
her
with
that
dreadful
smile
about
his
lips
and
the
red
fire
leaping
leaping
in
his
eyes
ca
you
guess
what
he
wants
he
said
he
wants
you
me
she
gazed
back
at
him
astounded
but
why
why
does
he
want
to
get
money
out
of
me
where
has
he
gone
monck
laughed
a
low
terrible
laugh
never
mind
where
he
has
gone
i
frightened
him
off
and
i
shoot
him
i
shoot
him
if
he
comes
back
you
mine
now
not
his
you
were
right
to
come
to
me
quite
right
i
was
just
coming
to
you
but
this
is
better
no
one
can
come
between
us
now
i
know
how
to
protect
my
wife
he
reached
out
his
hands
to
her
as
he
ended
his
eyes
shocked
her
inexpressibly
they
held
a
glare
that
was
inhuman
almost
devilish
she
drew
back
from
him
in
open
horror
captain
monck
i
am
not
your
wife
what
can
you
be
thinking
of
you
you
are
not
yourself
she
turned
with
the
words
seeking
the
door
that
led
into
the
passage
he
made
no
attempt
to
check
her
instinct
told
her
even
before
she
laid
her
hand
upon
it
that
it
was
locked
she
turned
back
facing
him
with
all
her
courage
captain
monck
i
command
you
to
let
me
go
clear
and
imperious
her
voice
fell
but
it
had
no
more
visible
effect
upon
him
than
the
drip
of
the
rain
outside
he
came
towards
her
swiftly
with
the
step
of
a
conqueror
ignoring
her
words
as
though
they
had
never
been
uttered
i
know
how
to
protect
my
wife
he
reiterated
i
will
shoot
any
man
who
tries
to
take
you
from
me
he
reached
her
with
the
words
and
for
the
first
time
she
flinched
so
terrible
was
his
look
she
shrank
away
from
him
till
she
stood
against
the
closed
door
through
lips
that
felt
stiff
and
cold
she
forced
her
protest
indeed
indeed
you
do
know
what
you
are
doing
open
the
door
and
let
me
go
her
voice
sounded
futile
even
to
herself
before
she
ceased
to
speak
his
arms
were
holding
her
his
lips
fiercely
passionate
were
seeking
hers
she
struggled
to
avoid
them
but
her
strength
was
as
a
child
he
quelled
her
resistance
with
merciless
force
he
choked
the
cry
she
tried
to
utter
with
the
fiery
insistence
of
his
kisses
he
held
her
crushed
against
his
heart
so
overwhelming
her
with
the
volcanic
fires
of
his
passion
that
in
the
end
she
lay
in
his
hold
helpless
and
gasping
too
shattered
to
oppose
him
further
she
scarcely
knew
when
the
fearful
tempest
began
to
abate
all
sense
of
time
and
almost
of
place
had
left
her
she
was
dizzy
quivering
on
fire
wholly
incapable
of
coherent
thought
when
at
last
it
came
to
her
that
the
storm
was
arrested
she
heard
a
voice
above
her
a
strangely
broken
voice
my
god
it
said
what
have
i
done
it
sounded
like
the
question
of
a
man
suddenly
awaking
from
a
wild
dream
she
felt
the
arms
that
held
her
relax
their
grip
she
knew
that
he
was
looking
at
her
with
eyes
that
held
once
more
the
light
of
reason
and
oddly
that
fact
affected
her
rather
with
dismay
than
relief
burning
from
head
to
foot
she
turned
her
own
away
she
felt
his
hand
pass
over
her
shamed
and
quivering
face
as
though
to
assure
himself
that
she
was
actually
there
in
the
flesh
and
then
abruptly
so
abruptly
that
she
tottered
and
almost
fell
he
set
her
free
he
turned
from
her
god
help
me
i
am
mad
he
said
she
stood
with
throbbing
pulses
gasping
for
breath
feeling
as
one
who
had
passed
through
raging
fires
into
a
desert
of
smouldering
ashes
she
seemed
to
be
seared
from
head
to
foot
the
fiery
torment
of
his
kisses
had
left
her
tingling
in
every
nerve
he
moved
away
to
the
table
on
which
he
had
flung
his
revolver
and
stood
there
with
his
back
to
her
he
was
swaying
a
little
on
his
feet
without
looking
at
her
he
spoke
his
voice
shaky
wholly
unfamiliar
you
had
better
go
i
i
am
not
safe
this
damned
fever
has
got
into
my
brain
she
leaned
against
the
door
in
silence
her
physical
strength
was
coming
back
to
her
but
yet
she
could
not
move
and
she
had
no
words
to
speak
he
seemed
to
have
reft
from
her
every
faculty
of
thought
and
feeling
save
a
burning
sense
of
shame
by
his
violence
he
had
broken
down
all
her
defences
she
seemed
to
have
lost
both
the
power
and
the
will
to
resist
she
remained
speechless
while
the
dreadful
seconds
crept
away
he
turned
round
upon
her
at
length
suddenly
almost
with
a
movement
of
exasperation
and
then
something
that
he
saw
checked
him
he
stood
silent
as
if
not
knowing
how
to
proceed
across
the
room
their
eyes
met
and
held
for
the
passage
of
many
throbbing
seconds
then
slowly
a
change
came
over
monck
he
turned
back
to
the
table
and
deliberately
picked
up
the
revolver
that
lay
there
she
watched
him
fascinated
over
his
shoulder
he
spoke
you
will
think
me
mad
perhaps
it
is
the
most
charitable
conclusion
you
could
come
to
but
i
fully
realize
that
when
a
thing
is
beyond
an
apology
it
is
an
insult
to
offer
one
the
key
of
the
door
is
under
the
pillow
on
the
bed
perhaps
you
will
not
mind
finding
it
for
yourself
he
sat
down
with
the
words
in
a
heavy
dogged
fashion
holding
the
revolver
dangling
between
his
knees
there
was
grim
despair
in
his
attitude
his
look
was
that
of
a
man
utterly
spent
it
came
to
stella
at
that
moment
that
the
command
of
the
situation
had
devolved
upon
her
and
with
it
a
heavier
responsibility
than
she
had
ever
before
been
called
upon
to
bear
she
put
her
own
weakness
from
her
with
a
resolution
born
of
expediency
for
the
need
for
strength
was
great
she
crossed
the
room
to
the
bed
felt
for
and
found
the
key
returned
to
the
door
and
inserted
it
in
the
lock
then
she
paused
he
had
not
moved
he
was
not
watching
her
he
sat
as
one
sunk
deep
in
dejection
bowed
beneath
a
burden
that
crushed
him
to
the
earth
but
there
was
even
in
his
abasement
a
certain
terrible
patience
that
sent
an
icy
misgiving
to
her
heart
she
did
not
dare
to
leave
him
so
it
needed
all
the
strength
she
could
muster
to
approach
him
but
she
compelled
herself
at
last
she
came
to
him
she
stood
before
him
captain
monck
she
said
her
voice
sounded
small
and
frightened
even
in
her
own
ears
she
clenched
her
hands
with
the
effort
to
be
strong
he
scarcely
stirred
his
eyes
remained
downcast
he
spoke
no
word
she
bent
a
little
captain
monck
if
you
have
fever
you
had
better
go
to
bed
he
moved
slightly
influenced
possibly
by
the
increasing
steadiness
of
her
voice
but
still
he
did
not
look
at
her
or
speak
she
saw
that
his
hold
upon
the
revolver
had
tightened
to
a
grip
and
prompted
by
an
inner
warning
that
she
could
not
pause
to
question
she
bent
lower
and
laid
her
hand
upon
his
arm
please
give
that
to
me
she
said
he
started
at
her
touch
he
almost
recoiled
why
he
said
his
voice
was
harsh
and
strained
even
savage
but
the
needed
strength
had
come
to
stella
and
she
did
not
flinch
you
have
no
use
for
it
just
now
she
said
please
be
sensible
and
let
me
have
it
sensible
he
said
his
eyes
sought
hers
suddenly
involuntarily
and
she
had
a
sense
of
shock
which
she
was
quick
to
control
for
they
held
in
their
depths
the
torment
of
hell
you
are
wrong
he
said
and
the
deadly
intention
of
his
voice
made
her
quiver
afresh
i
have
a
use
for
it
at
least
i
shall
have
presently
there
are
one
or
two
things
to
be
attended
to
first
it
was
then
that
a
strange
and
new
authority
came
upon
stella
as
if
an
unknown
force
had
suddenly
inspired
her
she
read
his
meaning
beyond
all
doubting
and
without
an
instant
hesitation
she
acted
captain
monck
she
said
you
have
made
a
mistake
you
have
done
nothing
that
is
past
forgiveness
you
must
take
my
word
for
that
for
just
now
you
are
ill
and
not
in
a
fit
state
to
judge
for
yourself
now
please
give
me
that
thing
and
let
me
do
what
i
can
to
help
you
practical
and
were
her
words
she
marvelled
at
herself
even
as
she
stooped
and
laid
a
steady
hand
upon
the
weapon
he
held
her
action
was
purposeful
and
he
relinquished
it
the
misery
in
his
eyes
gave
place
to
a
dumb
curiosity
now
stella
said
get
to
bed
and
i
will
bring
you
some
of
quinine
she
turned
from
him
revolver
in
hand
but
paused
and
in
a
moment
turned
back
captain
monck
you
heard
what
i
said
did
you
you
will
go
straight
to
bed
her
voice
held
a
hint
of
pleading
despite
its
insistence
he
straightened
himself
in
his
chair
he
was
still
looking
at
her
with
an
odd
wonder
in
his
eyes
wonder
that
was
mixed
with
a
very
unusual
touch
of
reverence
i
will
do
whatever
you
wish
he
said
thank
you
said
stella
then
please
let
me
find
you
in
bed
when
i
come
back
she
turned
once
more
to
go
went
to
the
door
and
opened
it
from
the
threshold
she
glanced
back
he
was
on
his
feet
gazing
after
her
with
the
eyes
of
a
man
in
a
trance
she
lifted
her
hand
now
remember
she
said
and
with
that
passed
quietly
out
closing
the
door
behind
her
her
brain
was
in
a
seething
turmoil
and
her
heart
was
leaping
within
her
like
a
wild
thing
suddenly
caged
but
very
strangely
all
fear
had
departed
from
her
only
a
brief
interval
before
she
had
found
herself
wishing
that
the
decision
of
her
life
destiny
had
not
rested
entirely
with
herself
it
seemed
to
her
that
a
great
revelation
had
been
vouchsafed
between
the
amazing
present
and
those
past
moments
of
troubled
meditation
and
she
knew
now
that
it
did
not
chapter
vii
service
rendered
the
news
that
monck
was
down
with
the
fever
brought
both
the
colonel
and
major
ralston
early
to
the
bungalow
on
the
following
morning
they
found
stella
and
the
peter
in
charge
of
both
patients
tommy
was
better
though
weak
monck
was
in
a
high
fever
and
delirious
stella
was
in
the
latter
room
for
he
would
not
suffer
her
out
of
his
sight
she
alone
seemed
to
have
any
power
to
control
him
and
ralston
noted
the
fact
with
astonishment
there
some
magic
about
you
he
observed
in
his
blunt
fashion
are
you
going
to
take
on
this
job
it
no
light
one
but
you
probably
do
it
better
than
any
one
else
it
was
a
tacit
invitation
and
stella
knowing
how
widespread
was
the
sickness
that
infected
the
station
accepted
it
without
demur
it
rather
looks
as
if
it
were
my
job
does
it
she
said
i
am
willing
anyway
to
do
my
best
ralston
looked
at
her
with
a
gleam
of
approval
but
the
colonel
drew
her
aside
to
remonstrate
it
not
fit
for
you
you
be
ill
yourself
if
ralston
were
nearly
at
his
wit
end
he
never
dream
of
allowing
it
but
stella
heard
the
protest
with
a
smile
believe
me
i
am
only
too
glad
to
be
able
to
do
something
useful
for
a
change
she
assured
him
as
to
being
ill
myself
i
will
promise
not
to
behave
so
badly
as
that
you
a
brick
my
dear
said
colonel
mansfield
i
wish
there
were
more
like
you
mind
you
take
plenty
of
quinine
with
which
piece
of
fatherly
advice
he
left
her
with
the
determination
to
keep
an
eye
on
her
and
see
that
ralston
did
not
work
her
too
hard
stella
however
had
no
fears
on
her
own
account
she
went
to
her
task
resolute
and
undismayed
feeling
herself
actually
indispensable
for
almost
the
first
time
in
her
life
her
influence
upon
monck
was
beyond
dispute
she
alone
possessed
the
power
to
calm
him
in
his
wildest
moments
and
he
never
failed
to
recognize
her
or
to
control
himself
to
a
certain
extent
in
her
presence
the
attack
was
a
sharp
one
and
for
a
while
ralston
was
more
uneasy
than
he
cared
to
admit
but
monck
constitution
was
a
good
one
and
after
three
days
of
acute
illness
the
fever
began
to
subside
tommy
was
by
that
time
making
good
progress
and
stella
who
till
then
had
snatched
her
rest
when
and
how
she
could
gave
her
charge
into
peter
keeping
and
went
to
bed
for
the
first
time
since
her
arrival
at
kurrumpore
till
she
actually
lay
down
she
did
not
realize
how
utterly
worn
out
she
was
or
how
little
the
odd
hours
of
sleep
that
she
had
been
able
to
secure
had
sufficed
her
but
as
she
laid
her
head
upon
the
pillow
slumber
swept
upon
her
on
soundless
wings
she
slept
almost
before
she
had
time
to
appreciate
the
exquisite
comfort
of
complete
repose
that
slumber
of
hers
lasted
for
many
hours
she
had
given
peter
express
injunctions
to
awake
her
in
good
time
in
the
morning
and
she
rested
secure
in
the
confidence
that
he
would
obey
her
orders
but
it
was
the
light
of
advancing
evening
that
filled
the
room
when
at
last
she
opened
her
eyes
there
had
come
a
break
in
the
rain
and
a
bar
of
misty
sunshine
had
penetrated
a
chink
in
the
green
blinds
and
lay
golden
across
the
indian
matting
on
the
floor
she
lay
and
gazed
at
it
with
a
bewildered
sense
of
uncertainty
as
to
her
whereabouts
she
felt
as
if
she
had
returned
from
a
long
journey
and
for
a
time
her
mind
dwelt
hazily
upon
the
himalayan
paradise
from
which
she
had
been
so
summarily
cast
forth
vague
figures
flitted
to
and
fro
through
her
brain
till
finally
one
in
particular
occupied
the
forefront
of
her
thoughts
she
found
herself
recalling
every
unpleasant
detail
of
the
old
kashmiri
beggar
who
had
lured
ralph
dacre
from
her
side
on
that
last
fateful
night
the
old
question
arose
within
her
and
would
not
be
stifled
had
the
man
murdered
and
robbed
him
ere
flinging
him
down
to
the
torrent
that
had
swept
his
body
away
the
wonder
tormented
her
as
of
old
but
with
renewed
intensity
she
had
awaked
with
the
conviction
strong
upon
her
that
the
man
was
not
far
away
that
she
had
seen
him
recently
and
that
everard
monck
had
seen
him
also
that
brought
her
thoughts
very
swiftly
to
the
present
to
illness
and
dependence
upon
her
and
in
a
flash
to
the
realization
that
she
had
spent
nearly
the
whole
day
as
well
as
the
night
in
sleep
in
keen
dismay
she
started
from
her
bed
and
began
a
rapid
toilet
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
she
heard
peter
low
discreet
knock
at
the
door
and
bade
him
enter
he
came
in
with
a
smiling
upon
her
with
such
tender
solicitude
that
she
had
it
not
in
her
heart
to
express
any
active
annoyance
with
him
oh
peter
you
should
have
called
me
hours
ago
was
all
she
found
to
say
he
set
down
the
tray
with
a
deep
salaam
but
the
captain
would
not
permit
me
he
said
he
is
better
stella
asked
quickly
he
is
much
better
my
the
doctor
smiled
upon
him
only
this
afternoon
and
told
him
he
was
a
damn
fraud
so
my
may
set
her
mind
at
rest
obviously
the
term
constituted
a
high
compliment
in
peter
estimation
and
the
evident
satisfaction
that
it
afforded
to
stella
seemed
to
confirm
the
impression
he
retired
looking
as
well
pleased
as
stella
had
ever
seen
him
she
finished
dressing
as
speedily
as
possible
ate
a
hasty
meal
and
hastened
to
tommy
room
to
her
surprise
she
found
it
empty
but
as
she
turned
on
the
threshold
the
sound
of
her
brother
laugh
came
to
her
through
the
passage
evidently
tommy
was
visiting
his
fellow
sufferer
with
a
touch
of
anxiety
as
to
monck
fitness
to
receive
a
visitor
she
turned
in
the
direction
of
the
laugh
but
at
monck
door
she
paused
constrained
by
something
that
checked
her
almost
like
a
hand
laid
upon
her
the
blood
ran
up
to
her
temples
and
beat
through
her
brain
she
found
she
could
not
enter
as
she
stood
there
hesitating
monck
voice
came
to
her
quiet
and
rational
she
could
not
hear
what
he
said
but
tommy
more
impetuous
tones
cutting
in
were
clearly
audible
oh
rats
my
dear
fellow
do
be
so
damn
modest
you
worth
a
score
of
dacres
and
you
bet
she
knows
it
stella
tingled
from
head
to
foot
in
another
moment
she
would
have
passed
swiftly
on
but
even
as
the
impulse
came
to
her
it
was
frustrated
the
door
in
front
of
her
suddenly
opened
and
she
was
face
to
face
with
monck
himself
he
stood
leaning
slightly
on
the
handle
of
the
door
he
was
draped
in
a
long
of
oriental
silk
that
hung
upon
him
dejectedly
as
if
it
yearned
for
a
stouter
tenant
in
it
he
looked
leaner
and
taller
than
he
had
ever
seemed
to
her
before
he
had
a
cigarette
between
his
lips
but
this
he
removed
with
a
flicker
of
humour
as
he
observed
her
glance
caught
in
the
act
he
remarked
please
come
in
something
that
was
very
far
from
humour
impelled
stella
to
say
quickly
i
hope
you
do
imagine
i
was
eavesdropping
he
looked
sardonic
for
an
instant
no
i
do
not
so
far
flatter
myself
he
said
i
was
referring
to
my
cigarette
she
entered
striving
for
dignity
then
as
his
attitude
caught
her
attention
she
forgot
herself
and
turned
upon
him
in
genuine
dismay
what
are
you
doing
out
of
bed
you
know
you
are
not
fit
for
it
oh
how
wrong
of
you
take
my
arm
he
transferred
his
hand
from
the
door
to
her
shoulder
and
she
felt
it
tremble
though
his
hold
was
strong
may
i
not
sit
up
to
tea
with
you
nurse
he
suggested
as
she
piloted
him
firmly
to
the
bedside
of
course
not
she
made
answer
the
consciousness
of
his
weakness
had
fully
restored
her
confidence
and
her
authority
besides
i
have
had
mine
tommy
you
too
it
is
too
bad
i
shall
never
dare
to
close
my
eyes
again
at
this
point
monck
laughed
so
suddenly
and
boyishly
that
she
found
it
utterly
impossible
to
continue
her
reproaches
he
humbly
apologized
as
he
subsided
upon
the
bed
and
turning
to
tommy
who
fully
dressed
was
reclining
at
his
ease
in
a
by
its
side
said
with
a
smile
you
get
back
to
your
own
compartment
my
son
it
is
good
for
me
to
have
two
people
in
the
room
with
me
at
the
same
time
and
your
sister
wants
to
take
my
pulse
undisturbed
or
listen
to
your
heart
suggested
tommy
irreverently
as
he
rose
turn
him
out
said
monck
leaning
luxuriously
upon
the
pillows
that
stella
arranged
for
him
tommy
laughed
as
he
sauntered
away
pulling
the
door
carelessly
after
him
but
recalled
by
monck
to
shut
it
a
sudden
silence
followed
his
departure
stella
was
at
the
window
looping
back
the
curtains
the
vague
sunlight
still
smote
across
the
dripping
compound
the
whole
plain
was
smoking
like
a
mighty
cauldron
stella
finished
her
task
and
stood
still
across
the
silence
came
monck
voice
are
you
going
to
give
me
my
medicine
she
turned
slowly
round
i
think
you
are
nearly
equal
to
doctoring
yourself
now
she
said
he
was
lying
raised
on
his
elbow
his
eyes
intent
and
searching
fixed
upon
her
abruptly
in
a
different
tone
he
spoke
in
other
words
quit
fooling
and
play
the
game
he
said
all
right
i
will
to
the
best
of
my
ability
first
of
all
may
i
tell
you
something
that
ralston
said
to
me
this
morning
certainly
stella
voice
sounded
constrained
and
formal
she
remained
with
her
back
to
the
window
for
some
reason
she
did
not
want
him
to
see
her
face
too
clearly
it
was
only
this
said
monck
he
said
that
i
had
you
to
thank
for
pulling
me
through
this
business
that
but
for
you
i
should
probably
have
gone
under
ralston
is
given
to
saying
that
sort
of
thing
so
if
you
will
allow
me
i
should
like
to
thank
you
for
the
trouble
you
have
taken
and
for
the
service
rendered
please
do
stella
said
after
all
it
was
no
more
than
you
did
for
tommy
nor
so
much
she
spoke
nervously
avoiding
his
look
the
shadow
of
a
smile
crossed
monck
face
i
chance
to
be
rather
fond
of
tommy
he
said
so
my
motive
was
more
or
less
a
selfish
one
but
you
had
not
that
incentive
so
i
should
be
all
the
more
grateful
i
am
afraid
i
have
given
you
a
lot
of
trouble
have
you
found
me
very
difficult
to
manage
he
put
the
question
suddenly
almost
imperiously
stella
was
conscious
of
a
momentary
surprise
there
was
something
in
the
tone
rather
than
the
words
that
puzzled
her
she
hesitated
over
her
reply
you
have
said
monck
that
means
i
have
been
very
unruly
do
you
mind
telling
me
what
happened
on
the
night
i
was
taken
ill
she
felt
a
burning
blush
rush
up
to
her
face
and
neck
before
she
could
check
it
it
was
impossible
to
attempt
to
hide
her
distress
from
him
she
forced
herself
to
speak
before
it
overwhelmed
her
i
would
rather
not
discuss
it
or
think
of
it
you
were
not
yourself
and
i
and
i
and
you
said
monck
his
voice
suddenly
sunk
very
low
she
commanded
herself
with
a
supreme
effort
i
wish
to
forget
it
she
said
with
firmness
he
was
silent
for
a
moment
or
two
she
began
to
wonder
if
it
would
be
possible
to
make
her
escape
before
he
could
pursue
the
subject
further
and
then
he
spoke
and
she
knew
that
she
must
remain
you
are
very
generous
he
said
more
generous
than
i
deserve
will
it
help
matters
at
all
if
i
tell
you
that
i
would
give
all
i
have
to
be
able
to
forget
it
too
or
to
believe
that
the
thing
i
remember
was
just
one
of
the
wild
delusions
of
my
brain
his
voice
was
deep
and
sincere
in
spite
of
herself
she
was
moved
by
it
she
came
forward
to
his
side
the
past
is
past
she
said
and
gave
him
her
hand
he
took
it
and
held
it
looking
at
her
in
his
straight
inscrutable
way
true
most
gracious
he
said
but
i
have
quite
done
with
it
yet
will
you
hear
me
a
moment
longer
you
have
of
your
goodness
pardoned
my
outrageous
behaviour
so
i
make
no
further
allusion
to
that
except
to
tell
you
that
i
had
been
tempted
to
try
a
native
drug
which
in
its
effects
was
worse
than
the
fever
pure
and
simple
but
there
is
one
point
which
only
you
can
make
clear
how
was
it
you
came
to
seek
me
out
that
night
his
grasp
upon
her
hand
was
reassuring
though
she
felt
the
quiver
of
physical
weakness
in
its
hold
it
was
the
grasp
of
a
friend
and
her
embarrassment
began
to
fall
away
from
her
i
came
she
said
because
i
had
been
startled
i
had
no
idea
you
were
anywhere
near
i
was
really
investigating
the
verandah
because
of
of
something
i
had
seen
when
the
light
from
this
window
attracted
me
i
thought
possibly
someone
had
broken
in
will
you
tell
me
what
startled
you
monck
said
she
looked
at
him
it
was
a
man
an
old
native
beggar
i
only
saw
him
for
a
moment
i
was
in
tommy
room
and
he
came
and
looked
in
at
me
you
you
must
have
seen
him
too
you
were
talking
very
excitedly
about
him
you
threatened
to
shoot
him
was
that
how
you
came
to
deprive
me
of
my
revolver
questioned
monck
she
coloured
again
vividly
no
i
thought
you
were
going
to
shoot
yourself
i
will
give
it
back
to
you
presently
when
you
consider
that
i
can
be
safely
trusted
with
it
he
suggested
with
his
brief
smile
but
tell
me
some
more
about
this
mysterious
old
beggar
of
yours
what
was
he
like
she
hesitated
momentarily
i
only
had
a
very
fleeting
glimpse
of
him
i
ca
tell
you
what
he
was
really
like
but
he
reminded
me
of
someone
i
never
want
to
think
of
or
suffer
myself
to
think
of
again
if
i
can
help
it
who
said
monck
his
voice
was
quiet
but
it
held
insistence
she
felt
as
if
his
eyes
pierced
her
compelling
her
reply
a
horrible
old
native
a
positive
nightmare
of
a
man
whom
i
shall
always
regard
as
in
some
way
the
cause
of
my
husband
death
in
the
pause
that
followed
her
words
monck
hand
left
hers
he
lay
still
looking
at
her
but
with
that
steely
intentness
that
told
her
nothing
she
could
not
have
said
whether
he
were
vitally
interested
in
the
matter
or
not
when
he
spoke
again
you
think
that
he
was
murdered
then
a
sharp
shudder
went
through
her
i
am
very
nearly
convinced
of
it
she
said
but
i
shall
never
know
for
certain
now
and
you
imagine
that
the
murderer
can
have
followed
you
here
he
pursued
no
oh
no
hastily
she
made
answer
it
is
ridiculous
of
course
he
would
never
be
such
a
fool
as
to
do
that
it
was
only
my
imagination
i
saw
the
figure
at
the
window
and
was
reminded
of
him
are
you
sure
the
figure
at
the
window
was
not
imagination
too
said
monck
forgive
my
asking
such
things
have
happened
oh
i
know
stella
said
it
is
a
question
i
have
been
asking
myself
ever
since
but
you
know
she
smiled
faintly
i
had
no
fever
that
night
besides
i
fancy
you
saw
him
too
his
smile
met
hers
i
saw
many
things
that
night
as
they
were
not
and
you
also
were
overwrought
and
very
tired
perhaps
you
had
had
an
exciting
supper
she
saw
that
he
meant
to
turn
the
subject
away
from
her
husband
death
and
a
little
thrill
of
gratitude
went
through
her
he
had
seen
how
reluctant
she
was
to
speak
of
it
she
followed
his
lead
with
relief
perhaps
perhaps
she
said
we
will
say
so
anyhow
and
now
do
you
know
i
think
you
had
better
have
your
tea
and
rest
you
have
done
a
lot
of
talking
and
you
will
be
getting
feverish
again
if
i
let
you
go
on
i
will
send
peter
in
with
it
he
raised
one
eyebrow
with
a
wry
expression
must
it
be
peter
he
said
she
relented
i
will
bring
it
myself
if
you
will
promise
not
to
talk
ah
he
said
and
if
i
promise
that
will
you
promise
me
one
thing
too
she
paused
what
is
that
his
eyes
met
hers
direct
but
baffling
not
to
run
away
from
me
he
said
the
quick
blood
mounted
again
in
her
face
she
stood
silent
he
lifted
an
urgent
hand
stella
in
heaven
name
do
be
afraid
of
me
she
laid
her
hand
again
in
his
she
could
not
do
otherwise
she
wanted
to
beg
him
to
say
nothing
further
to
let
her
go
in
peace
but
no
words
would
come
she
stood
before
him
mute
and
perhaps
he
knew
what
was
in
her
mind
monck
was
silent
also
after
that
single
earnest
appeal
of
his
he
held
her
hand
for
a
few
seconds
and
then
very
quietly
let
it
go
she
knew
by
his
action
that
he
would
respect
her
wish
for
the
time
at
least
and
say
no
more
chapter
viii
the
truce
tommy
was
in
a
bad
temper
with
everyone
a
most
unusual
state
of
affairs
the
weather
was
improving
every
day
the
rains
were
nearly
over
he
was
practically
well
again
too
well
to
be
sent
to
bhulwana
on
sick
leave
as
ralston
brutally
told
him
but
it
was
not
this
fact
that
had
upset
his
internal
equilibrium
he
did
not
want
sick
leave
and
bluntly
said
so
then
what
the
devil
do
you
want
said
ralston
equally
blunt
and
ready
to
resent
irritation
from
one
who
in
his
opinion
was
too
highly
favoured
of
the
gods
to
have
any
reasonable
grounds
for
complaint
tommy
growled
an
inarticulate
reply
it
was
not
his
intention
to
confide
in
ralston
whatever
his
grievance
but
ralston
not
to
be
frustrated
carried
the
matter
to
monck
then
on
the
high
road
to
recovery
what
in
thunder
is
the
matter
with
the
young
ass
he
demanded
he
gets
more
and
obstreperous
every
day
leave
him
to
me
said
monck
discharge
him
as
cured
i
manage
him
but
that
just
what
he
is
grumbled
ralston
he
ought
to
be
well
so
far
as
i
can
make
out
he
is
well
but
he
goes
about
looking
like
a
sick
fly
and
stinging
before
you
touch
him
leave
him
to
me
monck
said
again
that
afternoon
as
he
and
tommy
lounged
together
on
the
verandah
after
the
lazy
fashion
of
convalescents
he
turned
to
the
boy
in
his
abrupt
fashion
look
here
tommy
he
said
what
are
you
making
yourself
so
conspicuously
unpleasant
for
it
time
you
pulled
up
tommy
turned
crimson
i
he
stammered
who
says
so
stella
there
was
the
suspicion
of
a
smile
about
monck
grim
mouth
as
he
made
reply
no
not
stella
though
she
well
might
i
heard
you
being
beastly
rude
to
her
more
than
once
what
the
matter
with
you
want
a
kicking
eh
tommy
hunched
himself
in
his
wicker
chair
with
his
chin
on
his
chest
no
want
to
kick
he
said
in
a
savage
undertone
monck
laughed
briefly
he
was
standing
against
a
pillar
of
the
verandah
he
turned
and
sat
down
unexpectedly
on
the
arm
of
tommy
chair
who
do
you
want
to
kick
he
said
tommy
glanced
at
him
and
was
silent
significant
commented
monck
he
put
his
hand
with
very
unwonted
kindness
upon
the
lad
shoulder
what
do
you
want
to
kick
me
for
tommy
he
asked
tommy
shrugged
the
shoulder
under
his
hand
if
you
do
know
i
tell
you
he
said
gruffly
monck
fingers
closed
with
quiet
persistence
yes
you
can
out
with
it
he
said
but
tommy
remained
doggedly
silent
several
seconds
passed
then
very
suddenly
monck
raised
his
hand
and
smote
him
hard
on
the
back
damn
said
tommy
straightening
involuntarily
that
better
said
monck
that
do
you
good
do
curl
up
again
you
getting
disgracefully
like
to
have
a
bout
with
the
gloves
there
was
not
a
shade
of
in
his
voice
tommy
turned
round
upon
him
with
a
smile
as
involuntary
as
his
exclamation
had
been
what
a
brute
you
are
monck
you
have
such
a
beastly
trick
of
putting
a
fellow
in
the
wrong
you
are
in
the
wrong
asserted
monck
i
want
to
get
you
out
of
it
if
i
can
what
the
grievance
what
have
i
done
tommy
hesitated
for
a
moment
then
finally
reached
up
and
gripped
the
hand
upon
his
shoulder
monck
i
say
monck
he
said
boyishly
i
feel
such
a
cur
to
say
it
but
but
he
broke
off
abruptly
i
damned
if
i
can
say
it
he
decided
dejectedly
monck
fingers
suddenly
twisted
and
closed
upon
his
what
a
funny
little
ass
you
are
tommy
he
said
tommy
brightened
a
little
it
infernally
difficult
taking
you
to
task
he
explained
blushing
a
still
fierier
red
you
never
speak
to
me
again
after
this
monck
laughed
yes
i
shall
i
shall
respect
you
for
it
get
on
with
it
man
what
the
trouble
with
immense
effort
tommy
made
reply
well
it
pretty
beastly
to
have
to
ask
any
fellow
what
his
intentions
are
with
regard
to
his
sister
but
you
pretty
nearly
told
me
yours
then
what
more
do
you
want
questioned
monck
tommy
made
a
gesture
of
helplessness
damn
it
man
do
you
know
she
is
making
plans
to
go
home
well
said
monck
tommy
faced
round
i
say
like
a
good
chap
you
practically
forced
this
you
know
you
not
going
to
to
let
her
go
monck
eyes
looked
back
straight
and
hard
he
did
not
speak
for
a
moment
then
you
want
to
know
my
intentions
tommy
he
said
you
shall
your
sister
and
i
are
observing
a
truce
for
the
present
but
it
wo
last
for
ever
i
am
making
plans
for
a
move
myself
i
am
going
to
live
at
the
club
is
that
going
to
help
demanded
tommy
bluntly
monck
looked
sardonic
we
must
offend
the
angels
you
know
tommy
he
said
tommy
made
a
sound
expressive
of
gross
irreverence
oh
that
it
is
it
now
we
know
where
we
are
i
been
feeling
pretty
rotten
about
it
i
can
tell
you
you
always
were
an
ass
were
you
said
monck
getting
up
tommy
got
up
too
giving
himself
an
impatient
shake
he
pushed
an
apologetic
hand
through
monck
arm
i
ca
expect
ever
to
get
even
with
a
swell
like
you
he
said
humbly
monck
looked
at
him
something
in
the
boy
devotion
seemed
to
move
him
for
his
eyes
were
very
kindly
though
his
laugh
was
ironic
you
have
an
almighty
awakening
one
of
these
days
my
son
he
said
by
the
way
if
we
are
going
to
be
brothers
you
had
better
call
me
by
my
christian
name
by
jove
i
will
said
tommy
eagerly
and
if
there
is
anything
i
can
do
old
chap
anything
under
the
sun
i
let
you
know
said
monck
so
like
the
lifting
of
a
thunder
cloud
tommy
very
unwonted
fit
of
temper
merged
into
a
mood
of
great
benignity
and
ralston
complained
no
more
monck
took
up
his
abode
at
the
club
before
the
brief
winter
season
brought
the
angels
flitting
back
from
bhulwana
to
combine
pleasure
with
duty
at
kurrumpore
stella
accepted
his
departure
without
comment
missing
him
when
gone
after
a
fashion
which
she
would
have
admitted
to
none
she
did
not
wholly
understand
his
attitude
but
tommy
serenity
of
demeanour
made
her
somewhat
suspicious
for
tommy
was
transparent
as
the
day
ralston
return
made
her
life
considerably
easier
they
took
up
their
friendship
exactly
where
they
had
left
it
and
found
it
wholly
satisfactory
when
lady
harriet
mansfield
made
her
stately
appearance
stella
position
was
assured
no
one
looked
askance
at
her
any
longer
even
burton
criticism
was
limited
to
a
strictly
secret
smile
netta
ermsted
was
the
last
to
leave
bhulwana
she
returned
nervous
and
fretful
accompanied
by
tessa
whose
joy
over
rejoining
her
friends
was
as
patent
as
her
mother
discontent
tessa
had
a
great
deal
to
say
in
disparagement
of
the
rajah
of
markestan
and
said
it
so
often
and
with
such
emphasis
that
at
last
captain
ermsted
patience
gave
way
and
he
forbade
all
mention
of
the
man
under
penalty
of
a
severe
slapping
when
tessa
had
ignored
the
threat
for
the
third
time
he
carried
it
out
with
such
thoroughness
that
even
netta
was
startled
into
remonstrance
you
are
quite
right
to
keep
the
child
in
order
she
said
but
you
need
treat
her
like
that
i
call
it
brutal
you
can
call
it
what
you
like
said
ermsted
i
did
it
quite
as
much
for
your
benefit
as
for
hers
netta
tossed
her
head
i
not
a
sentimental
mother
she
observed
you
wo
punish
me
in
that
way
i
object
to
a
commotion
that
all
he
took
her
by
the
shoulder
do
you
he
said
then
i
advise
you
to
be
mighty
careful
for
i
warn
you
my
blood
is
up
she
made
a
face
at
him
albeit
there
was
a
quality
of
menace
in
his
hold
are
you
going
to
treat
me
as
you
have
just
treated
tessa
his
teeth
were
clenched
upon
his
lower
lip
do
be
a
little
devil
netta
he
said
she
snapped
her
fingers
then
do
you
be
a
big
fool
most
noble
richard
it
does
pay
to
bully
a
woman
she
can
always
get
her
own
back
one
way
or
another
remember
that
he
gripped
her
suddenly
by
both
arms
by
heaven
he
said
passionately
i
do
worse
than
beat
you
if
you
dare
to
trifle
with
me
she
tried
to
laugh
but
his
look
frightened
her
she
turned
as
white
as
the
muslin
wrap
she
wore
richard
dick
do
she
gasped
helplessly
he
held
her
locked
to
him
you
gone
too
far
he
said
i
have
dick
i
have
she
protested
dick
i
swear
to
you
i
have
never
i
have
never
he
stopped
the
words
upon
her
lips
with
his
own
but
his
kiss
was
terrible
she
shrank
from
it
trembling
appalled
in
a
moment
he
let
her
go
and
she
sank
upon
her
couch
hiding
her
quivering
face
with
convulsive
weeping
you
are
cruel
you
are
cruel
she
sobbed
he
remained
beside
her
looking
down
at
her
till
some
of
the
sternness
passed
from
his
face
he
bent
at
last
and
touched
her
i
not
cruel
he
said
i
just
in
earnest
that
all
you
be
careful
for
the
future
there
a
bit
of
the
devil
in
me
too
when
i
goaded
she
drew
herself
away
from
him
still
and
half
petulant
you
used
to
be
ever
so
much
nicer
than
you
are
now
she
said
keeping
her
face
averted
he
answered
her
sombrely
as
he
turned
away
i
used
to
have
a
wife
that
i
honoured
before
all
creation
she
sprang
to
her
feet
dick
how
can
you
be
so
horrid
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
he
walked
to
the
door
i
was
a
big
fool
he
said
very
bitterly
the
door
closed
upon
him
netta
stood
staring
at
it
tragic
and
suddenly
she
stamped
her
foot
and
whirled
round
in
a
rage
i
wo
be
treated
like
a
naughty
child
i
wo
i
wo
i
write
to
my
arabian
knight
i
write
now
and
tell
him
how
wretched
i
am
if
dick
objects
to
our
friendship
i
just
leave
him
that
all
i
was
a
donkey
ever
to
marry
him
i
always
knew
we
should
get
on
she
paused
listening
that
she
had
heard
him
returning
then
she
heard
his
voice
in
the
next
room
he
was
talking
to
tessa
she
set
her
lips
and
went
to
her
oh
yes
he
can
make
it
up
with
his
child
when
he
knows
he
has
been
brutal
but
never
a
single
kind
word
to
his
wife
not
one
word
she
took
up
a
pen
with
fingers
that
trembled
with
indignation
and
began
to
write
chapter
ix
the
oasis
for
two
months
tommy
possessed
his
impulsive
soul
in
patience
for
two
months
he
watched
monck
go
his
impassive
and
inscrutable
way
asking
no
further
question
the
gaieties
of
the
station
were
in
full
swing
christmas
was
close
at
hand
stella
was
making
definite
plans
for
departure
in
the
new
year
she
could
not
satisfy
herself
with
an
idle
life
though
tommy
vehemently
opposed
the
idea
of
her
going
monck
never
opposed
it
he
listened
silently
when
she
spoke
of
it
sometimes
faintly
smiling
she
often
saw
him
he
came
to
the
green
bungalow
in
tommy
company
at
all
hours
of
the
day
she
met
him
constantly
at
the
club
and
he
never
failed
to
come
to
her
side
there
and
by
some
means
known
only
to
himself
to
banish
the
crowd
of
subalterns
who
were
wont
to
gather
round
her
he
asserted
no
claim
but
the
claim
existed
and
was
mutely
recognized
he
never
spoke
to
her
intimately
he
never
attempted
to
pass
the
bounds
of
ordinary
friendship
only
very
rarely
did
he
make
her
aware
that
her
company
was
a
pleasure
to
him
but
the
fact
remained
that
she
was
the
only
woman
that
he
ever
sought
and
the
tongues
of
all
the
rest
were
busy
in
consequence
as
for
stella
she
still
told
herself
that
she
would
escape
with
her
freedom
he
would
speak
she
was
convinced
before
she
left
she
even
sometimes
told
herself
that
after
what
had
passed
between
them
it
was
almost
incumbent
upon
him
to
speak
but
she
believed
that
he
would
accept
her
refusal
philosophically
possibly
even
with
relief
she
restrained
herself
forcibly
from
dwelling
upon
the
thought
of
him
again
and
again
she
reminded
herself
that
he
trod
the
way
of
ambition
his
heart
was
given
to
his
work
and
a
man
may
not
serve
two
masters
he
cared
for
her
probably
but
in
a
calm
judicial
fashion
that
could
never
satisfy
her
if
she
married
him
she
would
come
second
and
a
very
poor
second
to
his
profession
and
so
she
did
not
mean
to
marry
him
and
so
she
checked
the
fevered
memory
of
passionate
kisses
that
had
burned
her
to
the
soul
of
arms
that
had
clasped
and
held
her
by
a
force
colossal
that
had
been
only
the
primitive
man
in
him
escaped
for
the
moment
beyond
his
control
the
primitive
man
which
he
had
succeeded
in
stifling
with
the
bonds
of
his
servitude
had
he
not
told
her
that
he
would
have
given
all
he
had
to
forget
that
single
wild
lapse
into
savagery
she
was
sure
that
he
despised
himself
for
it
he
would
never
for
an
instant
suffer
such
an
impulse
again
he
did
not
really
love
her
it
was
not
in
him
to
love
any
woman
he
would
make
her
a
formal
offer
of
marriage
and
when
she
had
refused
him
he
would
dismiss
the
matter
from
his
mind
and
return
to
his
work
undisturbed
so
she
schooled
herself
to
make
her
plans
leaving
him
out
of
the
reckoning
telling
herself
ever
that
her
newly
restored
freedom
was
too
dear
ever
to
be
sacrificed
again
in
ralston
company
she
attended
some
of
the
social
gatherings
of
the
station
but
she
took
no
keen
pleasure
in
them
she
disliked
lady
harriet
she
distrusted
burton
and
more
often
than
not
she
remained
away
the
coming
christmas
festivities
did
not
attract
her
she
held
aloof
till
tommy
who
was
in
the
thick
of
everything
suddenly
and
vehemently
demanded
her
presence
it
ridiculous
to
be
so
he
maintained
do
let
think
you
afraid
of
come
anyway
to
the
moonlight
picnic
at
khanmulla
on
christmas
eve
it
going
to
be
no
end
of
a
game
stella
smiled
a
little
do
you
know
tommy
i
think
i
rather
go
to
bed
absurd
declared
tommy
you
used
to
be
much
more
sporting
i
was
a
widow
in
those
days
stella
said
what
rot
what
damn
rot
cried
tommy
wrathfully
there
is
no
altering
the
fact
said
stella
he
left
her
fuming
that
evening
as
she
sat
on
the
club
verandah
with
ralston
watching
some
tennis
monck
came
up
behind
her
and
stood
against
the
wall
smoking
a
cigarette
he
did
not
speak
for
some
time
and
after
a
word
of
greeting
stella
turned
back
to
the
play
but
presently
ralston
got
up
and
went
away
and
after
an
interval
monck
came
silently
forward
and
took
the
vacant
seat
tommy
was
among
the
players
his
play
was
always
either
surprisingly
brilliant
or
amazingly
bad
and
on
this
particular
evening
he
was
winning
all
the
honours
stella
was
joining
in
the
general
applause
after
a
particularly
fine
stroke
when
suddenly
monck
voice
spoke
at
her
side
why
do
you
take
a
hand
sometimes
instead
of
always
looking
on
the
question
surprised
her
she
glanced
at
him
in
momentary
embarrassment
met
his
straight
look
and
smiled
perhaps
i
am
lazy
that
is
the
reason
he
said
why
do
you
lead
a
hermit
life
do
you
follow
your
own
inclination
in
so
doing
or
are
you
merely
proving
yourself
a
slave
to
an
unwritten
law
his
voice
was
curt
it
held
mastery
but
yet
she
could
not
resent
it
for
behind
it
was
a
masked
kindness
which
deprived
it
of
offence
she
decided
to
treat
the
question
lightly
perhaps
a
little
of
both
she
said
besides
it
seems
scarcely
worth
while
to
try
to
get
into
the
swim
now
when
i
am
leaving
so
soon
he
made
an
abrupt
movement
which
seemed
to
denote
suppressed
impatience
you
are
too
young
to
say
that
he
said
she
laughed
a
little
i
do
feel
young
i
think
life
moves
faster
in
tropical
countries
i
have
lived
years
since
i
have
been
here
and
i
am
glad
of
a
rest
he
was
silent
for
a
space
then
again
abruptly
he
returned
to
the
charge
you
not
going
to
waste
all
the
best
of
your
life
over
a
memory
are
you
the
finest
man
in
the
world
is
worth
that
she
felt
the
colour
rise
in
her
face
as
she
made
reply
i
hope
i
am
not
going
to
waste
my
life
at
all
is
it
a
waste
not
to
spend
it
in
a
feverish
round
of
social
pleasures
if
so
i
do
not
think
you
are
in
a
position
to
condemn
me
she
saw
his
brief
smile
for
an
instant
my
life
is
occupied
with
other
things
he
said
but
i
do
lead
a
hermit
existence
i
am
going
to
the
officers
picnic
at
khanmulla
on
the
for
instance
being
a
case
of
must
suggested
stella
by
no
means
monck
leaned
forward
to
light
another
cigarette
i
am
going
for
a
particular
purpose
if
that
purpose
is
not
fulfilled
he
paused
a
moment
and
she
felt
his
eyes
upon
her
again
i
shall
come
straight
back
he
ended
with
a
certain
doggedness
of
determination
that
did
not
escape
her
stella
gaze
was
fixed
upon
the
court
below
her
and
she
kept
it
there
but
she
saw
nothing
of
the
game
her
heart
was
beating
oddly
in
leaps
and
jerks
she
felt
curiously
as
if
she
were
under
the
influence
of
an
electric
battery
every
nerve
and
every
vein
seemed
to
be
tingling
he
had
not
asked
a
question
yet
she
felt
that
in
some
fashion
he
had
made
it
incumbent
upon
her
to
speak
in
answer
in
the
silence
that
followed
his
words
she
was
aware
of
an
insistence
that
would
not
be
denied
she
tried
to
put
it
from
her
but
could
not
in
the
end
more
than
half
against
her
will
she
yielded
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
go
she
said
if
only
to
pacify
tommy
a
very
good
and
sufficient
reason
commented
monck
enigmatically
he
lingered
on
beside
her
for
a
while
but
nothing
further
of
an
intimate
nature
passed
between
them
she
felt
that
he
had
gained
his
objective
and
would
say
no
more
the
truce
between
them
was
to
be
observed
until
the
psychological
moment
arrived
to
break
it
and
that
moment
would
occur
some
time
on
christmas
eve
in
the
moonlit
solitudes
of
khanmulla
later
she
reflected
that
perhaps
it
was
as
well
to
go
and
get
it
over
she
could
not
deny
him
his
opportunity
and
it
would
not
take
long
she
was
sure
it
would
not
take
long
to
convince
him
that
they
were
better
as
they
were
had
he
been
younger
less
wedded
to
his
work
less
the
slave
of
his
ambition
things
might
have
been
different
had
she
never
been
married
to
ralph
dacre
never
known
the
bondage
of
those
few
strange
weeks
she
might
have
been
more
ready
to
join
her
life
to
his
but
fate
had
intervened
between
them
and
their
paths
now
lay
apart
he
realized
it
as
well
as
she
did
he
would
not
press
her
their
eyes
were
open
and
if
the
oasis
in
the
desert
had
seemed
desirable
to
either
for
a
space
yet
each
knew
that
it
was
no
their
appointed
ways
lay
in
the
waste
beyond
diverging
ever
more
and
more
till
presently
even
the
greenness
of
that
oasis
in
which
they
had
met
together
would
be
no
more
to
either
than
a
dream
chapter
x
the
surrender
the
moon
was
full
on
christmas
eve
it
shone
in
such
splendour
that
the
whole
world
was
transformed
into
a
fairyland
of
black
and
silver
stella
stood
on
the
verandah
of
the
green
bungalow
looking
forth
into
the
dazzling
night
with
a
tremor
at
her
heart
the
glory
of
it
was
in
a
sense
overwhelming
it
made
her
feel
oddly
impotent
almost
afraid
as
if
some
great
power
menaced
her
she
had
never
felt
the
ruthlessness
of
the
east
more
strongly
than
she
felt
it
that
night
but
the
drugged
feeling
that
had
so
possessed
her
in
the
mountains
was
wholly
absent
from
her
now
she
felt
vividly
alive
almost
painfully
conscious
of
the
quick
blood
pulsing
through
her
veins
she
was
aware
of
an
intense
longing
to
escape
even
while
the
magic
of
the
night
yet
drew
her
irresistibly
deep
in
her
heart
there
lurked
an
uncertainty
which
she
could
not
face
up
to
that
moment
she
had
been
barely
aware
of
its
existence
but
now
she
felt
it
stirring
and
strangely
she
was
afraid
was
it
the
call
of
the
east
the
wonder
of
the
moonlight
or
was
it
some
greater
thing
yet
such
as
had
never
before
entered
into
her
life
she
could
not
say
but
her
face
was
still
firmly
set
towards
the
goal
of
liberty
whatever
was
in
store
for
her
she
meant
to
extricate
herself
she
meant
to
cling
to
her
freedom
at
all
costs
when
next
she
stood
upon
that
verandah
the
ordeal
she
had
begun
to
dread
so
needlessly
so
unreasonably
would
be
over
and
she
would
have
emerged
triumphant
so
she
told
herself
even
while
the
shiver
of
apprehension
which
she
could
not
control
went
through
her
causing
her
to
draw
her
wrap
more
closely
about
her
though
there
was
nought
but
a
pleasant
coolness
in
the
soft
air
that
blew
across
the
plain
she
and
tommy
were
to
drive
with
the
ralstons
to
the
ruined
palace
in
the
jungle
of
khanmulla
where
the
picnic
was
to
take
place
she
had
never
seen
it
but
had
heard
it
described
as
the
most
romantic
spot
in
markestan
it
had
been
the
site
of
a
fierce
battle
in
some
age
and
its
glories
had
departed
for
centuries
it
had
lain
deserted
and
crumbling
yet
some
of
its
ancient
beauty
remained
its
marble
floors
and
walls
of
carved
stone
were
not
utterly
obliterated
though
only
owls
and
made
it
their
natives
regarded
it
with
superstitious
awe
and
seldom
approached
it
but
europeans
all
looked
upon
it
as
the
most
beautiful
corner
within
reach
and
had
it
been
nearer
to
kurrumpore
it
would
have
been
a
far
more
frequented
playground
than
it
was
the
hoot
of
a
broke
suddenly
upon
the
silence
and
stella
started
it
was
the
horn
of
major
ralston
little
she
knew
it
well
but
they
had
not
proposed
using
it
that
night
she
and
tommy
were
to
accompany
them
in
a
waggonette
the
crunching
of
wheels
and
throb
of
the
engine
at
the
gate
told
her
it
was
stopping
then
the
ralstons
had
altered
their
plans
unless
something
suddenly
leapt
up
within
her
she
was
conscious
of
a
curious
constriction
at
the
throat
a
sense
of
suffocation
the
fuss
and
worry
of
the
engine
died
down
into
silence
and
in
a
moment
there
came
the
sound
of
a
man
feet
entering
the
compound
standing
motionless
with
hands
clenched
against
her
sides
she
gazed
forth
a
tall
straight
figure
was
coming
towards
her
between
the
whispering
tamarisks
it
was
not
major
ralston
he
walked
with
a
slouch
and
this
man
gait
was
firm
and
purposeful
he
came
up
to
the
with
unfaltering
determination
he
was
looking
full
at
her
and
she
knew
that
she
stood
revealed
in
the
marvellous
indian
moonlight
he
mounted
the
steps
with
the
same
absolute
that
yet
held
nought
of
arrogance
his
face
remained
in
shadow
but
she
did
not
need
to
see
it
the
reason
of
his
coming
was
proclaimed
in
every
line
in
every
calm
unwavering
movement
he
came
to
her
and
she
waited
there
in
the
merciless
moonlight
for
she
had
no
choice
i
have
come
for
you
he
said
the
words
were
brief
but
they
thrilled
her
strangely
her
eyes
fluttered
and
refused
to
meet
his
look
the
ralstons
are
taking
us
she
said
her
tone
was
cold
her
bearing
aloof
she
was
striving
for
he
could
not
have
known
of
the
tumult
within
her
yet
he
smiled
they
are
taking
tommy
he
said
she
heard
the
stubborn
note
in
his
voice
and
suddenly
and
completely
the
power
to
resist
went
from
her
she
held
out
her
hand
to
him
with
a
curious
gesture
of
appeal
captain
monck
if
i
come
with
you
his
fingers
closed
about
her
own
if
he
said
she
made
a
rather
piteous
attempt
to
laugh
really
i
do
want
to
she
said
really
said
monck
he
drew
a
little
nearer
to
her
still
holding
her
hand
his
grasp
was
firm
and
strong
really
he
said
again
she
stood
in
silence
for
she
could
not
give
him
any
answer
he
waited
for
a
moment
or
two
then
stella
he
said
are
you
afraid
of
me
she
shook
her
head
her
lips
had
begun
to
tremble
inexplicably
no
no
she
said
what
then
he
spoke
with
a
gentleness
that
she
had
never
heard
from
him
before
of
yourself
she
turned
her
face
away
from
him
i
am
afraid
of
life
she
told
him
brokenly
it
is
like
a
great
wheel
a
vast
machinery
i
have
been
caught
in
it
once
caught
and
crushed
oh
ca
you
understand
yes
he
said
again
for
a
space
he
was
silent
his
hand
yet
holding
hers
there
was
subtle
comfort
in
his
grasp
it
held
protection
and
so
you
want
to
run
away
from
it
he
said
at
length
do
you
think
that
going
to
help
you
she
choked
back
a
sob
i
do
know
i
have
no
judgment
i
do
trust
myself
you
believe
in
sincerity
he
said
in
being
true
to
yourself
then
as
she
winced
no
i
do
want
to
go
over
old
ground
we
are
talking
of
present
things
i
not
going
to
pester
you
not
going
to
ask
you
to
marry
me
even
again
she
was
aware
of
his
smile
though
his
speech
sounded
grim
until
you
have
honestly
answered
the
question
that
you
are
trying
to
shirk
perhaps
you
wo
thank
me
for
reminding
you
a
second
time
of
a
conversation
that
you
and
i
once
had
on
this
very
spot
but
i
must
i
told
you
that
i
had
been
waiting
for
my
turn
and
you
told
me
that
i
had
come
too
late
he
paused
but
she
did
not
speak
she
was
trembling
from
head
to
foot
he
leaned
towards
her
stella
i
not
such
a
fool
as
to
make
the
same
mistake
twice
over
i
not
going
to
miss
my
turn
a
second
time
i
loved
you
then
though
i
had
never
flattered
myself
that
i
had
a
chance
and
my
love
is
the
kind
that
burns
and
goes
out
his
voice
suddenly
quivered
i
do
know
whether
you
have
any
use
for
it
you
have
been
too
discreet
and
cautious
to
betray
yourself
your
heart
has
been
a
closed
book
to
me
but
i
am
going
to
open
that
book
i
have
the
right
and
you
ca
deny
it
to
me
if
you
were
queen
of
the
whole
earth
i
should
still
have
the
right
because
i
love
you
to
ask
you
as
i
ask
you
now
have
you
any
love
for
me
there
i
have
done
it
if
you
can
tell
me
honestly
that
i
am
nothing
to
you
that
is
the
end
but
if
not
if
not
again
she
heard
a
deep
vibration
in
his
voice
then
do
be
afraid
in
the
name
of
heaven
marriage
with
me
would
not
mean
slavery
he
stopped
abruptly
and
turned
from
her
from
the
room
behind
them
there
came
a
cheery
hail
tommy
came
tramping
through
hullo
old
chap
you
is
it
has
stella
been
attending
to
your
comfort
have
you
had
a
drink
monck
answer
had
a
sardonic
note
your
sister
has
been
kindness
itself
as
she
always
is
no
drinks
for
me
thanks
i
am
just
off
in
ralston
car
to
khanmulla
he
turned
deliberately
back
again
to
stella
will
you
come
with
me
or
will
you
go
with
tommy
and
the
ralstons
there
was
neither
anxiety
nor
persuasion
in
his
voice
tommy
frowned
over
its
utter
lack
of
emotion
he
did
not
think
his
friend
was
playing
his
cards
well
but
to
stella
that
coolness
had
a
different
meaning
it
stirred
her
to
an
impulse
more
headlong
than
at
the
moment
she
realized
i
will
come
with
you
she
said
good
said
monck
simply
and
stood
back
for
her
to
pass
she
went
by
him
without
a
glance
she
felt
as
if
the
wild
throbbing
of
her
heart
would
choke
her
he
had
spoken
in
such
a
fashion
as
she
had
dreamed
that
he
could
ever
speak
he
had
spoken
and
she
had
not
sent
him
away
that
was
the
thought
that
most
disturbed
her
till
that
moment
it
had
seemed
a
comparatively
easy
thing
to
do
her
course
had
been
clear
but
he
had
appealed
to
that
within
her
which
could
not
be
ignored
he
had
appealed
to
the
inner
truth
of
her
nature
and
she
could
not
close
her
ears
to
that
he
asked
her
only
to
be
true
to
herself
he
had
taken
his
stand
on
higher
ground
than
that
on
which
she
stood
he
had
not
urged
any
plea
on
his
own
behalf
he
had
only
urged
her
to
be
honest
and
in
so
doing
he
had
laid
bare
that
ancient
mistake
of
hers
that
had
devastated
her
life
he
did
not
desire
her
upon
the
same
terms
as
those
upon
which
she
had
bestowed
herself
upon
ralph
dacre
he
made
that
abundantly
clear
he
did
not
ask
her
to
subordinate
her
happiness
to
his
he
only
asked
for
straight
dealing
from
her
and
she
knew
that
he
asked
it
as
much
for
her
sake
as
for
his
own
he
would
not
seek
to
hold
her
if
she
did
not
love
him
that
was
the
great
touchstone
to
which
he
had
brought
her
and
she
knew
that
she
must
face
the
test
the
mastery
of
his
love
compelled
her
as
he
had
freely
asserted
he
had
the
right
just
because
he
was
an
honourable
man
and
he
loved
her
honourably
but
how
far
would
that
love
of
his
carry
him
she
longed
to
know
it
was
not
the
growth
of
a
brief
hour
passion
that
at
least
she
knew
it
would
not
burn
and
go
out
it
would
endure
somehow
she
realized
that
now
past
disputing
but
was
it
first
and
greatest
with
him
were
his
cherished
career
his
ambition
of
small
account
beside
it
was
he
willing
to
do
sacrifice
to
it
and
if
so
how
great
a
sacrifice
was
he
prepared
to
offer
she
yearned
to
ask
him
as
he
sped
her
in
silence
through
the
chequered
moonlight
of
the
khanmulla
jungle
but
some
inner
force
restrained
her
she
feared
to
break
the
spell
the
road
was
deserted
just
as
it
had
been
on
that
dripping
night
when
she
had
answered
his
summons
to
tommy
sick
bed
she
recalled
that
wild
rush
through
the
darkness
his
grim
strength
his
determination
the
iron
of
his
will
had
seemed
to
compass
her
then
was
it
the
same
had
her
freedom
already
been
wrested
from
her
was
there
to
be
no
means
of
escape
through
the
jungle
solitudes
there
came
the
call
of
an
owl
weird
and
desolate
and
lonely
something
in
it
pierced
her
with
a
curious
pain
was
freedom
then
everything
did
she
truly
love
the
silence
above
all
she
drew
her
cloak
closer
about
her
was
there
something
of
a
chill
in
the
atmosphere
or
was
it
the
chill
of
the
desert
beyond
the
oasis
that
awaited
her
they
emerged
from
the
thickest
part
of
the
jungle
into
a
space
of
tangled
shrubs
that
seemed
fighting
with
each
other
for
possession
of
the
way
the
road
was
rough
and
monck
slackened
speed
we
shall
have
to
leave
the
car
he
said
there
is
a
track
here
that
leads
to
the
ruined
palace
it
is
only
a
hundred
yards
or
so
we
shall
have
to
do
it
on
foot
they
descended
the
moonlight
poured
in
a
flood
all
about
them
they
were
alone
stella
turned
up
the
narrow
path
he
indicated
but
in
a
moment
he
overtook
her
let
me
go
first
he
said
he
passed
her
with
the
words
and
walked
ahead
holding
the
creepers
back
from
her
as
she
followed
she
suffered
him
silently
with
a
strange
sense
of
awe
almost
as
though
she
trod
holy
ground
but
the
old
feeling
of
trespass
was
wholly
absent
she
had
no
fear
of
being
cast
forth
from
this
place
that
she
was
about
to
enter
the
path
began
to
widen
somewhat
and
to
ascend
in
a
few
moments
they
came
upon
a
crumbling
stonewall
crossing
it
at
right
angles
monck
paused
one
way
leads
to
the
palace
the
other
to
the
temple
he
said
which
shall
we
take
stella
faced
him
in
the
moonlight
she
thought
he
looked
stern
is
not
the
picnic
to
be
at
the
palace
she
said
yes
he
answered
her
without
hesitation
you
will
find
lady
harriet
and
there
the
temple
on
the
other
hand
is
probably
deserted
ah
his
meaning
flashed
upon
her
she
stood
a
second
in
indecision
then
is
it
far
she
said
she
saw
his
faint
smile
for
an
instant
a
very
long
way
for
you
he
said
i
can
come
back
she
said
i
shall
not
prevent
you
she
heard
the
smile
in
his
voice
and
something
within
her
thrilled
in
answer
let
us
go
then
she
said
he
turned
without
further
words
and
led
the
way
they
entered
the
shadow
of
the
jungle
once
more
for
a
space
the
path
ran
beside
the
crumbling
wall
then
it
diverged
from
it
winding
darkly
into
the
very
heart
of
the
jungle
monck
walked
without
hesitation
he
evidently
knew
the
place
well
they
came
at
length
upon
a
second
clearing
smaller
than
the
first
and
here
in
the
centre
of
a
moonlit
space
there
stood
the
ruined
walls
of
a
little
native
temple
or
mausoleum
a
flight
of
worn
marble
steps
led
to
the
dark
arch
of
the
doorway
monck
stretched
a
hand
to
his
companion
and
they
ascended
side
by
side
a
bubbling
murmur
of
water
came
from
within
it
seemed
to
fill
the
place
with
gurgling
gnomelike
laughter
they
entered
and
monck
stood
still
for
a
space
of
many
seconds
he
neither
moved
nor
spoke
it
was
almost
as
if
he
were
waiting
for
some
signal
they
looked
forth
into
the
moonlight
they
had
left
through
the
opening
the
air
around
them
was
chill
and
dank
somewhere
in
the
darkness
behind
them
a
frog
croaked
and
tiny
feet
scuttled
and
scrambled
for
a
few
moments
and
then
were
still
again
stella
shivered
drawing
her
cloak
more
closely
round
her
why
did
you
bring
me
to
this
eerie
place
she
said
speaking
under
her
breath
involuntarily
he
stirred
as
if
her
words
aroused
him
from
a
reverie
are
you
afraid
he
said
i
should
be
by
myself
she
made
answer
i
do
think
i
like
india
at
too
close
quarters
she
is
so
mysterious
and
so
horribly
ruthless
he
passed
over
the
last
two
sentences
as
though
they
had
not
been
uttered
but
you
are
not
afraid
with
me
he
said
she
quivered
at
something
in
his
question
i
am
not
sure
she
said
i
sometimes
think
that
you
are
rather
ruthless
too
do
you
know
me
well
enough
to
say
that
he
said
she
tried
to
answer
him
lightly
i
ought
to
by
this
time
i
have
had
ample
opportunity
yes
he
said
rather
bitterly
but
you
are
prejudiced
you
cling
to
a
preconceived
idea
if
you
love
me
it
is
in
spite
of
yourself
something
in
his
voice
hurt
her
like
the
cry
of
a
wounded
thing
she
made
a
quick
impulsive
movement
towards
him
oh
but
that
is
not
so
she
said
you
do
understand
please
do
think
anything
so
so
hard
of
me
are
you
sure
it
is
not
so
he
said
stella
stella
are
you
sure
the
words
pierced
her
afresh
she
suddenly
felt
that
she
could
bear
no
more
oh
please
she
said
oh
please
and
laid
a
quivering
hand
upon
his
arm
you
are
making
it
very
difficult
for
me
do
you
realize
how
much
better
it
would
be
for
your
own
sake
not
to
press
me
any
further
no
he
said
just
the
one
word
spoken
doggedly
almost
harshly
his
hands
were
clenched
and
rigid
at
his
sides
almost
instinctively
she
began
to
plead
with
him
as
one
who
pleads
for
freedom
ah
but
listen
a
moment
you
have
your
life
to
live
your
career
means
very
much
to
you
marriage
means
hindrance
to
a
man
like
you
marriage
means
loitering
by
the
way
and
there
is
no
time
to
loiter
you
have
taken
up
a
big
thing
and
you
must
carry
it
through
you
must
put
every
ounce
of
yourself
into
it
you
must
work
like
a
galley
slave
if
you
do
you
will
be
a
failure
who
told
you
that
he
demanded
she
met
the
fierceness
of
his
eyes
unflinchingly
i
know
it
everyone
knows
it
you
have
given
yourself
heart
and
soul
to
india
to
the
empire
nothing
else
counts
or
ever
can
count
now
in
the
same
way
it
is
quite
right
that
it
should
be
so
you
are
a
builder
and
you
must
follow
your
profession
you
will
follow
it
to
the
end
and
you
will
do
great
things
immortal
things
her
voice
shook
a
little
but
you
must
keep
free
from
all
hampering
burdens
all
private
cares
above
all
you
must
not
think
of
marriage
with
a
woman
whose
chief
desire
is
to
escape
from
india
and
all
that
india
means
whose
sympathies
are
utterly
alien
from
her
and
whose
youth
has
died
a
violent
death
at
her
hands
oh
do
you
see
the
madness
of
it
surely
you
must
see
a
quiver
of
deep
feeling
ran
through
her
words
she
had
not
meant
to
go
so
far
but
she
was
driven
driven
by
a
force
that
would
not
be
denied
she
wanted
him
to
see
the
matter
with
her
eyes
somehow
that
seemed
essential
now
things
had
gone
so
far
between
them
it
was
intolerable
now
that
he
should
misunderstand
but
as
she
ceased
to
speak
she
abruptly
realized
that
the
effect
of
her
words
was
other
than
she
intended
he
had
listened
to
her
with
a
rigid
patience
but
as
her
words
went
into
silence
it
seemed
as
if
the
iron
will
by
which
till
then
he
had
held
himself
in
check
had
suddenly
snapped
he
stood
for
a
second
or
two
longer
with
an
odd
smile
on
his
face
and
that
in
his
eyes
which
startled
her
into
a
momentary
feeling
that
was
almost
panic
then
with
a
single
swift
movement
he
bent
and
caught
her
to
him
and
you
think
that
counts
he
said
you
think
that
anything
on
earth
counts
but
this
his
lips
were
upon
hers
as
he
ended
stopping
all
protest
all
utterance
he
kissed
her
hotly
fiercely
holding
her
so
pressed
that
above
the
wild
throbbing
of
her
own
heart
she
felt
the
deep
strong
beat
of
his
his
action
was
passionate
and
overwhelming
she
would
have
withstood
him
but
she
could
not
and
there
was
that
within
her
that
rejoiced
that
exulted
because
she
could
not
yet
as
at
last
his
lips
left
hers
she
turned
her
face
aside
hiding
it
from
him
that
he
might
not
see
how
completely
he
had
triumphed
he
laughed
a
little
above
her
bent
head
he
did
not
need
to
see
stella
you
and
i
have
got
to
sink
or
swim
together
if
you
wo
have
success
with
me
then
i
will
share
your
failure
she
quivered
at
his
words
she
was
clinging
to
him
almost
without
knowing
it
oh
no
oh
no
she
said
his
hand
came
gently
upwards
and
lay
upon
her
head
my
dear
that
rests
with
you
i
have
sworn
that
marriage
to
me
shall
not
mean
bondage
if
india
is
any
obstacle
between
us
india
will
go
oh
no
she
said
again
no
everard
no
he
bent
his
face
to
hers
his
lips
were
on
her
hair
you
love
me
stella
he
said
she
was
silent
her
breathing
short
spasmodic
difficult
his
cheek
pressed
her
forehead
why
not
own
it
he
said
softly
is
it
so
hard
she
lifted
her
face
swiftly
her
arms
clasped
his
neck
and
if
if
i
do
will
you
let
me
go
she
asked
him
tremulously
the
smile
still
hovered
about
his
lips
no
he
said
it
is
madness
she
pleaded
desperately
it
is
kismet
he
made
answer
and
took
her
face
between
his
hands
looking
deeply
steadily
into
her
eyes
your
life
is
bound
up
with
mine
you
know
it
stella
you
know
it
she
uttered
a
sob
that
yet
was
half
laughter
i
have
done
my
best
she
said
why
are
you
so
so
merciless
you
surrender
he
said
she
gave
herself
to
the
drawing
of
his
hands
have
i
any
choice
not
if
you
are
honest
he
said
ah
she
coloured
rather
painfully
i
have
at
least
been
honest
in
trying
to
keep
you
from
this
this
big
mistake
i
know
you
will
repent
it
when
this
fever
is
past
you
will
regret
oh
so
bitterly
he
set
his
jaw
and
all
the
grim
strength
of
the
man
was
suddenly
apparent
shall
i
tell
you
the
secret
of
success
he
said
abruptly
it
is
just
never
to
look
back
it
is
the
secret
of
happiness
also
if
people
only
realized
it
if
you
want
to
make
the
best
of
life
got
to
look
ahead
i
going
to
make
you
do
that
stella
you
been
sitting
mourning
by
the
wayside
long
enough
she
smiled
almost
in
spite
of
herself
for
the
note
of
mastery
in
his
voice
was
inexplicably
sweet
i
thought
that
myself
she
said
but
i
not
going
to
let
you
patch
up
my
life
with
yours
if
this
must
be
and
you
are
sure
you
are
sure
that
it
must
i
have
spoken
he
said
she
faced
him
resolutely
then
india
shall
have
us
both
now
i
have
spoken
too
his
face
changed
the
grimness
became
eagerness
stella
do
you
mean
that
he
said
it
a
big
sacrifice
too
big
for
you
her
eyes
were
shining
as
stars
shine
through
a
mist
she
was
drawing
his
head
downwards
that
her
lips
might
reach
his
oh
my
darling
she
said
and
the
thrill
of
love
triumphant
was
in
her
words
nothing
would
be
too
big
it
simply
ceases
to
be
a
sacrifice
if
it
is
done
for
your
dear
sake
her
lips
met
his
upon
the
words
and
in
that
kiss
she
gave
him
all
she
had
it
was
the
rich
bestowal
of
a
woman
full
treasury
than
which
it
may
be
there
is
nought
greater
on
earth

chamber
bhulwana
in
early
spring
bhulwana
of
the
singing
birds
and
darting
squirrels
bhulwana
of
the
pines
stella
stood
in
the
green
compound
of
the
bungalow
known
as
the
grand
stand
gazing
down
upon
the
green
racecourse
with
eyes
that
dreamed
the
evening
was
drawing
near
they
had
arrived
but
a
few
minutes
before
in
major
ralston
car
and
the
journey
had
taken
the
whole
day
her
mind
went
back
to
that
early
hour
almost
in
the
dawning
when
she
and
everard
monck
had
knelt
together
before
the
altar
of
the
little
english
church
at
kurrumpore
and
been
pronounced
man
and
wife
ralston
and
tommy
alone
had
attended
the
wedding
the
hour
had
been
kept
a
strict
secret
from
all
besides
and
they
had
gone
straight
forth
into
the
early
sunlight
of
the
new
day
and
sped
away
into
the
morning
rejoicing
a
blue
jay
had
laughed
after
them
at
starting
and
a
blue
jay
was
laughing
now
in
the
budding
acacia
by
the
gate
there
seemed
a
mocking
note
in
its
laughter
but
it
held
gaiety
as
well
listening
to
it
she
forgot
all
the
weary
miles
of
desert
through
which
they
had
travelled
the
world
was
fair
very
fair
here
at
bhulwana
and
they
were
alone
there
fell
a
step
on
the
grass
behind
her
she
thrilled
and
turned
he
came
and
put
his
arm
around
her
do
you
think
you
can
stand
seven
days
of
it
he
said
she
leaned
her
head
against
him
i
want
to
catch
every
moment
of
them
and
hold
it
fast
how
shall
we
make
the
time
pass
slowly
he
smiled
at
the
question
do
you
know
i
was
afraid
this
place
would
appeal
to
you
her
hand
sought
and
closed
upon
his
ah
why
not
she
said
he
did
not
answer
her
only
with
his
face
bent
down
to
hers
he
said
the
past
is
past
then
for
ever
she
made
swift
reply
but
i
have
always
loved
bhulwana
even
in
my
sad
times
ah
listen
that
is
a
they
listened
to
the
bird
flutelike
piping
standing
closely
linked
in
the
shadow
of
a
little
group
of
pines
in
the
bungalow
behind
them
peter
the
great
was
decking
the
table
for
their
the
scent
of
white
roses
was
in
the
air
languorous
exquisite
the
blue
jay
laughed
again
in
the
acacia
by
the
gate
laughed
and
flew
away
good
riddance
said
monck
do
you
like
him
said
stella
i
not
particularly
keen
on
being
jeered
at
he
answered
she
laughed
at
him
in
her
turn
i
never
thought
you
cared
a
single
what
any
one
thought
of
you
he
smiled
perhaps
i
have
got
more
sensitive
since
i
knew
you
she
lifted
her
lips
to
his
with
a
sudden
movement
i
am
like
that
too
everard
i
care
terribly
now
he
kissed
her
and
his
kiss
was
passionate
no
one
shall
ever
think
anything
but
good
of
you
my
stella
he
said
she
clung
to
him
ah
but
the
outside
world
does
matter
she
said
it
is
only
we
ourselves
and
our
secret
innermost
hearts
that
count
everard
let
us
be
more
than
true
to
each
other
let
us
be
quite
quite
open
always
he
held
her
fast
but
he
made
no
answer
to
her
appeal
her
eyes
sought
his
that
is
possible
is
it
she
pleaded
my
heart
is
open
to
you
there
is
not
a
single
corner
of
it
that
you
may
not
enter
his
arms
clasped
her
closer
i
know
he
said
i
know
but
you
be
hurt
or
sorry
if
i
can
not
say
the
same
my
life
is
a
more
complex
affair
than
yours
remember
ah
that
is
india
she
said
but
let
me
share
that
part
too
let
me
be
a
partner
in
all
i
can
be
as
secret
as
the
wiliest
oriental
of
them
all
i
would
so
love
to
be
trusted
it
would
make
me
so
proud
he
kissed
her
again
you
might
be
very
much
the
reverse
sometimes
he
said
if
you
knew
some
of
the
secrets
i
had
to
keep
india
is
india
and
she
can
be
very
lurid
upon
occasion
there
is
only
one
way
of
treating
her
then
but
i
am
not
going
to
let
you
into
any
unpleasant
secrets
that
is
bluebeard
chamber
and
you
have
got
to
stay
outside
she
made
a
small
but
vehement
gesture
in
his
arms
i
hate
india
she
said
she
dominates
you
like
like
like
what
he
said
she
hid
her
face
from
him
like
a
horrible
mistress
she
whispered
stella
he
said
she
throbbed
in
his
hold
i
had
to
say
it
are
you
angry
with
me
no
he
said
but
you
do
like
me
for
it
all
the
same
her
voice
came
muffled
from
his
shoulder
you
do
realize
very
likely
you
never
will
how
near
the
truth
it
is
he
was
silent
but
in
the
silence
his
hold
tightened
upon
her
till
it
was
almost
a
grip
she
turned
her
face
up
again
at
last
i
told
you
it
was
madness
to
marry
me
she
said
tremulously
i
told
you
you
would
repent
he
looked
at
her
with
a
strange
smile
and
i
told
you
it
was
kismet
he
said
you
did
it
because
it
was
written
that
you
should
for
better
for
worse
his
voice
vibrated
you
and
i
are
bound
by
the
same
fate
it
was
inevitable
and
there
can
be
no
repentance
just
as
there
can
be
no
turning
back
but
you
need
hate
india
on
that
account
i
have
told
you
that
i
will
give
her
up
for
your
sake
and
that
stands
but
i
will
not
give
you
up
for
india
or
for
any
other
power
on
earth
now
are
you
satisfied
her
face
quivered
at
the
question
it
is
more
than
i
deserve
she
said
you
shall
give
up
nothing
for
me
he
put
his
hand
upon
her
forehead
stella
will
you
give
her
a
trial
give
her
a
year
possibly
by
that
time
i
may
tell
you
more
than
i
am
able
to
tell
you
now
i
do
know
if
you
would
welcome
it
but
there
are
always
a
chosen
few
to
whom
success
comes
i
may
be
one
of
the
few
i
have
a
strong
belief
in
my
own
particular
star
again
i
may
fail
if
i
fail
i
swear
i
will
give
her
up
i
will
start
again
at
some
new
job
but
will
you
be
patient
for
a
year
will
you
my
darling
let
me
prove
myself
i
only
ask
one
year
her
eyes
were
full
of
tears
everard
you
make
me
feel
ashamed
she
said
i
wo
wo
be
a
drag
on
you
spoil
your
career
you
must
forgive
me
for
being
jealous
it
is
because
i
love
you
so
but
i
know
it
is
a
selfish
form
of
love
and
i
wo
give
way
to
it
i
will
never
separate
you
from
the
career
you
have
chosen
i
only
wish
i
could
be
a
help
to
you
you
can
only
help
me
by
being
patient
just
at
present
he
said
and
not
asking
tiresome
questions
she
smiled
at
him
though
her
tears
had
overflowed
but
oh
you
wo
take
risks
will
you
not
unnecessary
risks
it
is
so
terrible
to
think
of
you
in
danger
to
think
to
think
of
that
horrible
deformed
creature
who
sent
ralph
she
broke
off
shuddering
and
clinging
to
him
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
ever
spoken
of
her
first
husband
by
name
to
him
he
dried
the
tears
upon
her
cheeks
my
own
girl
you
need
be
afraid
he
said
and
though
his
words
were
kind
she
wondered
at
the
grimness
of
his
voice
i
am
not
the
sort
of
person
to
be
disposed
of
in
that
way
shall
we
talk
of
something
less
agitating
i
ca
have
you
crying
on
our
his
tone
was
repressive
she
was
conscious
of
a
chill
yet
it
was
a
relief
to
turn
from
the
subject
for
she
recognized
that
there
was
small
satisfaction
to
be
derived
therefrom
the
sun
was
setting
moreover
and
it
was
growing
cold
she
let
him
lead
her
back
into
the
bungalow
and
they
presently
sat
down
at
the
table
that
peter
had
prepared
with
so
much
solicitude
later
they
lingered
for
awhile
on
the
verandah
watching
the
blazing
stars
till
it
came
to
monck
that
his
bride
was
nearly
dropping
with
weariness
and
then
he
would
not
suffer
her
to
remain
any
longer
when
she
had
gone
within
he
lit
a
pipe
and
wandered
out
alone
into
the
starlight
following
the
deserted
road
that
led
to
the
rajah
summer
palace
he
paced
along
slowly
with
bent
head
deep
in
thought
at
the
great
marble
gateway
that
led
into
the
he
paused
and
stood
for
a
space
in
frowning
contemplation
a
small
wind
had
sprung
up
and
moaned
among
the
that
overlooked
the
high
wall
he
seemed
to
be
listening
to
it
or
was
it
to
the
hoot
of
an
owl
that
came
up
from
the
valley
finally
he
drew
near
and
deliberately
tapped
the
ashes
from
his
pipe
upon
the
shining
marble
the
embers
smouldered
and
went
out
a
black
stain
remained
upon
the
dazzling
white
surface
of
the
stone
column
he
looked
at
it
for
a
moment
or
two
then
turned
and
retraced
his
steps
with
grim
precision
when
he
reached
the
bungalow
he
turned
into
the
room
in
which
they
had
dined
and
sat
down
to
write
time
passed
but
he
took
no
note
of
it
it
was
past
midnight
ere
he
thrust
his
papers
together
at
length
and
rose
to
go
the
main
passage
of
the
bungalow
was
bright
with
moonlight
as
he
traversed
it
a
crouching
figure
rose
up
from
a
shadowed
doorway
at
his
approach
peter
the
great
looked
at
him
with
reproach
in
his
eyes
monck
stopped
short
he
accosted
the
man
in
his
own
language
but
peter
made
answer
in
the
careful
english
that
was
his
pride
even
so
i
watch
over
my
until
you
come
to
her
i
keep
her
safe
by
night
as
well
as
by
day
i
am
her
servant
he
stood
back
with
dignity
that
monck
might
pass
but
monck
stood
still
he
looked
at
peter
with
a
level
scrutiny
for
a
few
moments
then
it
is
enough
he
said
with
brief
decision
when
i
am
not
with
your
i
look
to
you
to
guard
her
peter
made
his
stately
without
further
words
he
conveyed
the
fact
that
without
his
permission
no
man
might
enter
the
room
behind
him
and
live
very
softly
monck
turned
the
handle
of
the
door
and
passed
within
leaving
him
alone
in
the
moonlight
chapter
ii
evil
tidings
they
walked
on
the
following
morning
over
the
hill
and
down
into
the
valley
beyond
a
place
of
running
streams
and
fresh
spring
verdure
stella
revelled
in
its
sweetness
it
made
her
think
of
home
you
have
told
me
anything
about
your
brother
she
said
as
they
sat
together
on
a
grey
boulder
and
basked
in
the
sunshine
have
i
monck
spoke
meditatively
i
got
a
photograph
of
him
somewhere
you
must
see
it
you
like
my
brother
he
added
with
a
smile
he
is
a
bit
like
me
she
laughed
that
a
recommendation
certainly
but
tell
me
what
he
is
like
i
want
to
know
monck
considered
he
is
a
short
chap
stout
and
red
rather
like
a
comedian
in
face
i
think
he
appreciates
a
joke
more
than
any
one
i
know
he
sounds
a
dear
said
stella
and
added
with
a
gay
and
certainly
not
in
the
least
like
you
have
you
written
yet
to
break
the
news
of
your
very
rash
marriage
yes
i
wrote
two
days
ago
he
will
probably
cable
his
blessing
that
is
the
sort
of
chap
he
is
it
will
be
rather
a
shock
for
him
stella
observed
you
had
no
idea
of
changing
your
state
when
you
saw
him
last
summer
there
fell
a
somewhat
abrupt
silence
monck
was
filling
his
pipe
and
the
process
seemed
to
engross
all
his
thoughts
finally
rather
suddenly
he
spoke
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
did
see
him
last
summer
you
did
see
him
stella
opened
her
eyes
wide
not
when
you
went
home
i
did
go
home
monck
eyes
were
still
fixed
upon
his
pipe
no
one
knows
that
but
you
he
said
and
one
other
that
is
the
first
secret
out
of
bluebeard
chamber
that
i
have
confided
in
you
keep
it
close
stella
sat
and
gazed
but
he
would
not
meet
her
eyes
tell
me
she
said
at
last
who
is
the
other
the
colonel
he
shook
his
head
no
not
the
colonel
you
must
ask
questions
stella
if
i
ever
expand
at
all
if
you
do
i
shall
shut
up
like
a
clam
and
you
may
get
pinched
in
the
process
she
slipped
her
hand
through
his
arm
i
will
remember
she
said
thank
you
ever
so
much
for
telling
me
i
will
bury
it
very
deep
no
one
shall
ever
suspect
it
through
me
thanks
he
said
he
pressed
her
hand
but
he
kept
his
eyes
lowered
i
know
i
can
trust
you
you
wo
try
to
find
out
the
things
i
keep
back
oh
never
she
said
never
i
shall
never
try
to
pry
into
affairs
of
state
he
smiled
rather
cynically
that
is
a
very
wise
resolution
he
said
i
shall
tell
bernard
that
i
have
married
the
most
discreet
woman
in
the
empire
as
well
as
the
most
beautiful
did
you
marry
her
for
her
beauty
or
for
her
discretion
asked
stella
neither
he
said
are
you
sure
she
leaned
her
cheek
against
his
shoulder
it
no
good
pretending
with
me
you
know
i
can
see
through
anything
detect
any
disguise
so
far
as
you
are
concerned
think
so
said
monck
answer
my
question
she
said
i
did
know
you
asked
one
his
voice
was
brusque
he
pushed
his
pipe
into
his
mouth
without
looking
at
her
she
reached
up
and
daringly
removed
it
i
asked
what
you
married
me
for
she
said
and
you
suck
your
horrid
pipe
and
wo
even
look
at
me
his
arm
went
round
her
he
looked
down
into
her
eyes
and
she
saw
the
fiery
worship
in
his
own
for
a
moment
its
intensity
almost
frightened
her
it
was
like
the
red
fire
of
a
volcano
rushing
forth
upon
her
a
fierce
unshackled
force
for
a
space
he
held
her
so
gazing
at
her
then
suddenly
he
crushed
her
to
him
he
kissed
her
burningly
till
she
felt
as
if
caught
and
consumed
by
the
flame
my
god
he
said
passionately
can
i
put
that
into
words
she
clung
to
him
but
she
was
trembling
there
was
that
about
him
at
the
moment
that
startled
her
she
was
in
the
presence
of
something
terrible
something
she
could
not
fathom
there
was
more
than
rapture
in
his
passion
it
was
poignant
with
a
fierce
defiance
that
challenged
all
the
world
she
lay
against
his
breast
in
silence
while
the
storm
that
she
had
so
unwittingly
raised
spent
itself
then
at
last
as
his
hold
began
to
slacken
she
took
courage
she
laid
her
cheek
against
his
hand
ah
do
love
me
too
much
at
first
darling
she
said
give
me
the
love
that
lasts
and
you
think
my
love
will
not
last
he
said
his
voice
low
and
very
deep
she
softly
kissed
the
hand
she
held
no
i
did
say
or
mean
that
i
believe
it
is
the
greatest
thing
that
i
shall
ever
possess
but
shall
i
tell
you
a
secret
there
is
something
in
it
that
frightens
me
even
though
i
glory
in
it
my
dear
he
said
she
raised
her
lips
again
to
his
yes
i
know
that
is
foolish
but
i
do
know
you
yet
remember
i
have
never
yet
seen
you
angry
with
me
you
never
will
he
said
yes
i
shall
her
eyes
were
gazing
into
his
but
they
saw
beyond
there
will
come
a
day
when
something
will
come
between
us
it
may
be
only
a
small
thing
but
it
will
not
seem
small
to
you
and
you
will
be
angry
because
i
do
not
see
with
your
eyes
and
i
think
the
very
greatness
of
your
love
will
make
it
harder
for
us
both
you
worship
me
everard
i
am
only
human
and
you
will
be
so
bitterly
disappointed
afterwards
when
you
discover
my
limitations
i
will
risk
that
he
said
no
i
do
want
you
to
take
any
risks
if
you
set
up
an
idol
and
it
falls
you
may
be
i
think
you
are
the
kind
of
man
to
be
ruined
by
it
she
spoke
very
earnestly
but
his
faint
smile
told
her
that
her
words
had
failed
to
convince
are
you
really
afraid
of
all
that
he
asked
curiously
she
caught
her
breath
yes
i
am
afraid
i
do
think
you
know
yourself
your
strength
or
your
weakness
you
have
the
least
idea
what
you
would
say
or
do
or
even
feel
if
you
thought
me
unkind
or
unjust
to
you
i
should
probably
sulk
he
said
she
shook
her
head
oh
no
you
would
explode
sooner
or
later
and
it
would
be
a
very
violent
explosion
i
wonder
if
you
have
ever
been
really
furious
with
any
one
you
cared
about
with
tommy
for
instance
i
have
said
monck
but
i
do
fancy
you
will
get
him
to
relate
his
experiences
he
survived
it
anyway
you
tell
me
she
said
he
hesitated
it
rather
a
shame
to
give
the
boy
away
but
there
is
nothing
very
extraordinary
in
it
when
tommy
first
came
out
he
felt
the
heat
like
lots
of
others
he
was
thirsty
and
he
drank
he
does
do
it
now
i
do
mind
wagering
that
he
never
will
again
i
stopped
him
everard
how
stella
was
looking
at
him
with
the
keenest
interest
do
you
really
want
to
know
how
he
still
spoke
with
slight
hesitation
of
course
i
do
i
suppose
you
were
very
angry
with
him
i
was
very
angry
i
had
reason
to
be
he
fell
foul
of
me
one
night
at
the
club
it
does
matter
how
he
did
it
he
was
responsible
in
any
case
but
i
had
to
act
to
keep
him
out
of
hot
water
i
took
him
back
to
my
quarters
dacre
was
away
that
night
and
i
had
him
to
myself
i
kept
my
temper
with
him
at
first
till
he
showed
fight
and
tried
to
kick
me
then
i
let
him
have
it
i
gave
him
a
licking
such
a
licking
as
he
never
got
at
school
it
sobered
him
quite
effectually
poor
little
beggar
an
odd
note
of
tenderness
crept
through
the
grimness
of
monck
speech
but
i
did
stop
then
he
had
to
have
his
lesson
and
he
had
it
when
i
had
done
with
him
there
was
no
kick
left
in
him
he
was
as
limp
as
a
wet
rag
but
he
was
quite
sober
and
to
the
best
of
my
belief
he
has
never
been
anything
else
from
that
day
to
this
of
course
it
was
all
highly
irregular
but
it
saved
a
worse
row
in
the
end
monck
faint
smile
appeared
he
realized
that
in
fact
he
was
game
enough
to
thank
me
for
it
in
the
morning
and
apologized
like
a
gentleman
for
giving
so
much
trouble
oh
i
glad
he
did
that
stella
said
with
shining
eyes
and
that
was
the
beginning
of
your
friendship
well
i
had
always
liked
him
monck
admitted
but
he
did
like
me
for
a
long
time
after
that
thrashing
stuck
in
his
mind
it
was
a
pretty
stiff
one
certainly
he
was
always
very
polite
to
me
but
he
avoided
me
like
the
plague
i
think
he
was
ashamed
i
left
him
alone
till
one
day
he
got
ill
and
then
i
went
round
to
see
if
i
could
do
anything
he
was
pretty
bad
and
i
stayed
with
him
we
got
friendly
afterwards
after
you
had
saved
his
life
stella
said
monck
laughed
that
sort
of
thing
does
count
in
india
if
it
comes
to
that
you
saved
mine
no
we
came
to
an
understanding
and
managed
to
hit
it
ever
since
stella
got
to
her
feet
were
you
very
brutal
to
him
everard
he
reached
a
brown
hand
to
her
as
she
stood
of
course
i
was
he
deserved
it
too
if
a
man
makes
a
beast
of
himself
he
need
never
look
for
mercy
from
me
she
looked
at
him
dubiously
and
if
a
woman
makes
you
angry
she
said
he
got
to
his
feet
and
put
his
arm
about
her
shoulders
but
i
treat
women
like
that
he
said
not
even
my
wife
i
have
quite
another
sort
of
treatment
for
her
it
curious
that
you
should
credit
me
with
such
a
vindictive
temperament
i
do
know
what
i
have
done
to
deserve
it
she
leaned
her
head
against
him
my
darling
forgive
me
it
is
just
my
horrid
suspicious
nature
he
pressed
her
to
him
you
certainly
do
know
me
very
well
yet
he
said
they
went
back
to
the
bungalow
in
the
late
afternoon
walking
hand
in
hand
as
children
supremely
content
the
blue
jay
laughed
at
the
gate
as
they
entered
and
monck
looked
up
jeer
away
you
son
of
a
satyr
he
said
i
was
going
to
shoot
you
but
i
changed
my
mind
we
all
friends
in
this
compartment
stella
squeezed
his
hand
hard
everard
i
love
you
for
that
she
said
simply
do
you
think
we
could
make
friends
with
the
monkeys
too
and
the
jackals
and
the
scorpions
and
the
dear
little
said
monck
no
doubt
we
could
if
we
lived
long
enough
do
laugh
at
me
she
protested
i
am
quite
in
earnest
there
are
plenty
of
things
to
love
in
india
there
india
herself
said
monck
she
looked
at
him
with
resolution
shining
in
her
eyes
you
must
teach
me
she
said
he
shook
his
head
no
my
dear
if
you
do
feel
the
lure
of
her
then
you
are
not
one
of
her
chosen
and
i
can
never
make
you
so
she
is
either
a
goddess
in
her
own
right
or
the
most
treacherous
old
who
ever
sat
in
a
heathen
temple
she
can
be
both
to
love
her
you
must
be
prepared
to
take
her
either
way
they
went
up
into
the
bungalow
peter
the
great
glided
forward
like
a
magnificent
genie
and
presented
a
scrap
of
paper
on
a
salver
to
monck
he
took
it
opened
it
frowned
over
it
the
messenger
arrived
three
hours
ago
he
could
not
wait
murmured
peter
monck
frown
deepened
he
turned
to
stella
go
and
have
tea
dear
and
then
rest
do
wait
for
me
i
must
go
round
to
the
club
and
get
on
the
telephone
at
once
the
grimness
of
his
face
startled
her
to
kurrumpore
she
asked
quickly
is
there
something
wrong
not
yet
he
said
curtly
do
you
worry
i
shall
be
back
as
soon
as
possible
let
me
come
too
she
said
he
shook
his
head
no
go
and
rest
he
was
gone
with
the
words
striding
swiftly
down
the
path
as
he
passed
out
on
to
the
road
he
broke
into
a
run
she
stood
and
listened
to
his
receding
footsteps
with
foreboding
in
her
heart
tea
is
ready
my
said
peter
softly
behind
her
she
thanked
him
with
a
smile
and
went
in
he
followed
her
and
waited
upon
her
with
all
a
woman
solicitude
for
a
while
she
suffered
him
in
silence
then
suddenly
peter
she
said
what
was
the
messenger
like
peter
hesitated
momentarily
then
he
was
old
he
said
old
and
ragged
not
worthy
of
your
august
consideration
she
turned
in
her
chair
was
he
was
he
anything
like
that
that
holy
man
peter
you
know
who
i
mean
her
face
was
deathly
as
she
uttered
the
question
let
my
be
comforted
said
peter
soothingly
it
was
not
the
holy
man
the
bearer
of
evil
tidings
ah
the
words
sank
down
through
her
heart
like
a
stone
dropped
into
a
well
but
i
think
the
tidings
were
evil
all
the
same
did
he
say
what
it
was
but
as
a
sudden
memory
shot
across
her
i
ought
not
to
ask
i
wish
i
wish
the
captain
would
come
back
let
my
have
patience
said
peter
gently
he
will
soon
come
now
the
blue
jay
laughed
at
the
gate
gleefully
uproariously
derisively
stella
shivered
he
is
coming
said
peter
she
started
up
monck
was
returning
he
came
up
the
compound
like
a
man
who
has
been
beaten
in
a
race
his
face
was
grey
his
eyes
terrible
stella
went
swiftly
to
the
to
meet
him
everard
what
is
it
oh
what
is
it
she
said
he
took
her
arm
turning
her
back
have
you
had
tea
he
said
his
voice
was
low
but
absolutely
steady
its
deadly
quietness
made
her
tremble
i
have
finished
she
said
i
have
been
waiting
for
you
you
need
have
done
that
he
said
i
wo
have
any
peter
he
turned
on
the
waiting
servant
get
me
some
brandy
he
sat
down
setting
her
free
but
she
remained
beside
him
and
after
a
moment
laid
her
hand
lightly
upon
his
shoulder
without
words
he
reached
up
instantly
caught
and
held
it
in
a
grip
that
almost
made
her
wince
stella
he
said
it
been
a
very
short
honeymoon
but
afraid
it
over
i
got
to
get
back
at
once
i
am
coming
with
you
she
said
quickly
he
looked
up
at
her
with
eyes
that
burned
with
a
strange
intensity
but
he
did
not
speak
in
answer
an
awful
dread
clutched
her
she
knelt
swiftly
down
beside
him
everard
listen
i
do
care
what
has
happened
or
what
is
likely
to
happen
my
place
is
by
your
side
and
nowhere
else
i
am
coming
with
you
nothing
on
earth
shall
prevent
me
her
words
were
quick
and
vehement
her
whole
being
pulsated
she
challenged
his
look
with
eyes
of
shining
resolution
his
arms
were
round
her
in
a
moment
he
held
her
fast
my
stella
my
wife
he
said
she
clung
closely
to
him
by
your
side
i
will
face
anything
you
know
it
darling
i
am
not
afraid
i
know
i
know
he
said
i
wo
leave
you
behind
i
could
now
but
a
time
will
come
when
we
shall
have
to
separate
we
got
to
face
that
wait
till
it
comes
she
whispered
it
is
yet
he
kissed
her
on
the
lips
no
not
yet
thank
heaven
you
want
to
know
what
has
happened
i
will
tell
you
ermsted
you
know
ermsted
was
shot
in
the
jungle
near
khanmulla
this
afternoon
about
half
an
hour
ago
oh
everard
she
started
back
in
horror
and
was
struck
afresh
by
the
awful
intentness
of
his
eyes
yes
he
said
and
if
i
had
been
here
to
receive
that
message
i
could
have
prevented
it
oh
everard
she
said
again
he
went
on
doggedly
i
ought
to
have
been
here
my
agent
knew
i
was
in
the
place
i
ought
to
have
stayed
within
reach
these
warnings
might
arrive
at
any
time
i
was
a
damned
lunatic
and
ermsted
has
paid
the
price
he
stopped
and
his
look
changed
poor
girl
it
been
a
shock
to
you
he
said
a
beastly
awakening
for
us
both
stella
was
very
pale
i
feel
she
said
slowly
as
if
i
were
pursued
by
a
remorseless
fate
you
he
questioned
this
had
nothing
to
do
with
you
she
leaned
against
him
wherever
i
go
trouble
follows
have
you
noticed
it
it
seems
as
if
as
if
whichever
way
i
turn
a
flaming
sword
is
stretched
out
barring
the
way
her
voice
suddenly
quivered
i
know
why
oh
yes
i
know
why
it
is
because
once
like
the
man
without
a
i
found
my
way
into
a
forbidden
paradise
they
hurled
me
out
everard
i
was
flung
into
a
desert
of
ashes
and
now
now
that
i
have
dared
to
approach
by
another
way
the
sentence
has
gone
forth
that
wherever
i
pass
something
shall
die
that
dreadful
man
told
me
on
the
day
that
ralph
was
taken
away
from
me
that
the
holy
ones
were
angry
and
my
dear
he
was
right
i
shall
never
be
pardoned
until
i
have
somehow
expiated
my
sin
stella
stella
he
broke
in
upon
her
sharply
you
are
talking
wildly
your
sin
as
you
call
it
was
at
the
most
no
more
than
a
bad
mistake
ca
you
put
it
from
you
get
above
it
have
you
no
faith
i
thought
all
women
had
that
she
looked
at
him
strangely
i
was
brought
up
to
believe
in
god
she
said
at
least
not
personally
not
intimately
were
you
yes
he
said
ah
her
eyes
widened
a
little
and
you
still
believe
in
him
still
believe
he
really
cares
even
when
things
go
hopelessly
wrong
yes
he
said
again
i
ca
talk
about
him
but
i
know
he
there
she
still
regarded
him
with
wonder
oh
my
dear
she
said
finally
are
you
behind
me
or
a
very
very
long
way
in
front
he
smiled
faintly
grimly
probably
a
thousand
miles
behind
he
said
but
i
have
been
given
long
sight
that
all
she
rose
to
her
feet
with
a
sigh
and
i
she
said
very
sadly
am
blind
down
by
the
gate
the
blue
jay
laughed
again
laughed
and
flew
away
chapter
iii
the
beast
of
prey
in
a
darkened
room
netta
ermsted
lay
trembling
and
unnerved
as
usual
in
cases
of
adversity
ralston
had
taken
charge
of
her
but
there
was
very
little
that
she
could
do
it
was
more
a
matter
for
her
husband
skill
than
for
hers
and
he
could
only
prescribe
absolute
quiet
for
netta
was
utterly
broken
since
the
fatal
moment
when
she
had
returned
from
a
call
in
her
to
find
major
burton
awaiting
her
with
the
news
that
ermsted
had
been
shot
on
the
while
riding
home
from
khanmulla
she
had
been
as
one
distraught
they
had
restrained
her
almost
forcibly
from
rushing
forth
to
fling
herself
upon
his
dead
body
and
now
that
it
was
all
over
now
that
the
man
who
had
loved
her
and
whom
she
had
never
loved
was
in
his
grave
she
lay
prostrate
refusing
all
comfort
tessa
and
speculative
was
in
the
care
of
burton
alternately
quarrelling
vigorously
with
little
cedric
burton
whose
intellectual
leanings
provoked
her
most
ardent
contempt
and
teasing
the
luckless
scooter
out
of
sheer
boredom
till
all
the
animal
ideas
in
life
centred
in
a
desperate
desire
to
escape
it
was
tessa
to
whom
stella
pitying
attention
was
first
drawn
on
the
day
after
her
return
to
the
green
bungalow
tommy
finding
her
raging
in
the
road
like
a
little
over
some
small
with
burton
had
lifted
her
on
to
his
shoulders
and
brought
her
back
with
him
be
good
to
the
poor
imp
he
muttered
to
his
sister
nobody
wants
her
certainly
mrs
burton
did
not
she
passed
her
on
to
stella
with
her
smile
and
tessa
and
scooter
forthwith
cheerfully
took
up
their
abode
at
the
green
bungalow
with
satisfaction
stella
experienced
little
difficulty
in
dealing
with
the
child
she
found
herself
the
object
of
the
most
passionate
admiration
which
went
far
towards
simplifying
the
problem
of
managing
her
tessa
adored
her
and
followed
her
like
her
shadow
whenever
she
was
not
similarly
engrossed
with
her
beloved
tommy
of
monck
she
stood
in
considerable
awe
he
did
not
take
much
notice
of
her
it
seemed
to
stella
that
he
had
retired
very
deeply
into
his
shell
of
reserve
during
those
days
even
with
herself
he
was
reticent
monosyllabic
obviously
absorbed
in
matters
of
which
she
had
no
knowledge
but
for
her
small
worshipper
she
would
have
been
both
lonely
and
anxious
for
he
was
often
absent
sometimes
for
hours
at
a
stretch
wholly
without
warning
giving
no
explanation
upon
his
return
she
asked
no
questions
she
schooled
herself
to
patience
she
tried
to
be
content
with
the
close
holding
of
his
arms
when
they
were
together
and
the
certainty
that
all
the
desire
of
his
heart
was
for
her
alone
but
she
could
not
wholly
drive
away
the
conviction
that
at
the
very
gates
of
her
paradise
the
sword
she
dreaded
had
been
turned
against
her
they
were
back
in
the
desert
again
and
the
way
to
the
tree
of
life
was
barred
perhaps
it
was
natural
that
she
should
turn
to
tessa
for
consolation
and
distraction
the
child
was
original
in
all
her
ways
her
ideas
of
death
were
wholly
devoid
of
tragedy
and
she
was
too
accustomed
to
her
father
absence
to
feel
any
actual
sense
of
loss
do
you
think
daddy
likes
heaven
she
said
to
stella
one
day
i
hope
mother
will
be
quick
and
go
there
too
it
would
be
better
for
her
than
staying
behind
with
the
rajah
i
always
call
him
slithy
tove
he
is
so
narrow
and
wriggly
he
wanted
me
to
kiss
him
once
but
i
would
he
looked
so
so
mischievous
tessa
tossed
her
head
besides
i
only
kiss
white
men
hear
hear
said
tommy
who
was
cleaning
his
pipe
on
the
verandah
you
stick
to
that
my
child
mother
said
i
was
very
silly
said
tessa
she
was
quite
cross
but
the
rajah
only
laughed
in
that
nasty
slippy
way
he
has
and
took
her
cigarette
away
and
smoked
it
himself
i
hated
him
for
that
ended
tessa
with
a
little
gleam
of
the
in
her
blue
eyes
it
it
was
a
liberty
tommy
guffaw
sounded
from
the
verandah
it
went
into
a
greeting
of
monck
who
came
up
unexpectedly
at
the
moment
and
sat
down
on
a
to
examine
a
handful
of
papers
stella
working
within
the
room
looked
up
swiftly
at
his
coming
but
if
he
had
so
much
as
glanced
in
her
direction
he
was
fully
engrossed
with
the
matter
in
hand
ere
she
had
time
to
observe
it
he
had
been
out
since
early
morning
and
she
had
not
seen
him
for
several
hours
tessa
who
possessed
at
times
an
almost
uncanny
shrewdness
left
her
and
went
to
stand
on
one
leg
in
the
doorway
most
people
she
observed
say
to
their
wives
when
they
come
in
very
intelligent
of
said
tommy
do
you
think
the
rajah
does
i
do
know
said
tessa
seriously
i
went
to
the
palace
at
bhulwana
once
to
see
them
but
the
rajah
was
there
they
were
very
kind
she
added
dispassionately
but
rather
silly
i
do
wonder
the
rajah
likes
white
men
wives
best
oh
quite
natural
agreed
tommy
he
gave
mother
a
beautiful
ring
with
a
diamond
in
it
went
on
tessa
delighted
to
have
secured
his
attention
and
watching
furtively
for
some
sign
of
interest
from
monck
also
it
was
worth
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
pounds
that
was
the
last
thing
daddy
was
cross
about
he
was
cross
why
asked
tommy
cos
he
was
jealous
i
expect
said
tessa
wisely
i
thought
he
was
going
to
give
her
a
whipping
and
i
hid
in
his
to
see
mother
was
awful
frightened
she
went
down
on
her
knees
to
him
and
he
was
just
going
to
do
it
i
know
he
was
and
then
he
came
into
the
and
found
me
and
so
he
whipped
me
instead
tessa
ended
on
a
note
of
resentment
served
you
jolly
well
right
said
tommy
no
it
did
said
tessa
he
only
did
it
mother
had
made
him
angry
it
was
a
child
whipping
at
all
it
was
a
whipping
and
he
used
a
switch
and
it
hurt
worse
than
anything
ever
hurt
before
that
why
i
did
mind
when
he
went
to
heaven
the
other
day
i
hope
i
sha
go
there
for
a
long
time
yet
it
is
nice
to
be
whipped
like
that
and
i
was
going
to
say
i
was
sorry
either
i
knew
that
would
make
him
crosser
than
anything
poor
chap
said
tommy
suddenly
tessa
came
a
step
nearer
to
him
says
the
man
who
did
it
will
be
hanged
if
they
catch
him
she
said
if
it
is
the
rajah
will
you
manage
so
as
i
can
go
and
see
i
should
like
to
tessa
exclaimed
stella
tessa
turned
flushed
cheeks
and
shining
eyes
upon
her
i
would
she
declared
stoutly
i
would
there
nothing
wrong
in
that
he
a
horrid
man
it
is
wrong
is
it
captain
monck
but
if
he
shot
my
daddy
she
went
swiftly
to
monck
with
the
words
and
leaned
ingratiatingly
against
him
you
kill
a
man
yourself
that
did
a
thing
like
that
you
very
likely
said
monck
she
gazed
at
him
admiringly
i
expect
you
killed
lots
and
lots
of
men
have
you
she
said
he
smiled
with
a
touch
of
grimness
do
you
think
i
going
to
tell
a
scaramouch
like
you
he
said
everard
stella
rose
and
came
to
the
window
do
please
make
her
understand
that
people
do
murder
each
other
just
whenever
they
feel
like
it
even
in
india
he
raised
his
eyes
to
hers
and
an
odd
sense
of
shock
went
through
her
it
was
as
if
in
some
fashion
he
had
deliberately
made
her
aware
of
that
secret
chamber
which
she
might
not
enter
i
think
you
would
probably
be
more
convincing
on
that
point
than
i
should
he
said
she
gave
a
little
shudder
she
could
not
restrain
it
that
look
in
his
eyes
reminded
her
of
something
something
dreadful
what
was
it
ah
yes
she
remembered
now
he
had
had
that
look
on
that
night
of
terror
when
he
had
first
called
her
his
wife
when
he
had
barred
the
window
behind
her
and
sworn
to
slay
any
man
who
should
come
between
them
she
turned
aside
and
went
in
without
another
word
india
again
india
the
savage
the
implacable
the
ruthless
she
felt
as
a
prisoner
who
battered
fruitlessly
against
an
iron
door
tessa
inquisitive
eyes
followed
her
she
going
to
cry
she
said
to
monck
tommy
turned
sharply
upon
his
friend
with
accusation
in
his
glance
but
the
next
instant
he
summoned
tessa
as
if
she
had
been
a
terrier
and
walked
off
into
the
compound
with
the
child
capering
at
his
side
monck
sat
for
a
moment
or
two
looking
straight
before
him
then
he
packed
together
the
papers
in
his
hand
and
stepped
through
the
open
window
into
the
room
behind
it
was
empty
he
went
through
it
without
a
pause
and
turned
along
the
passage
to
the
door
of
his
wife
room
it
stood
he
pushed
it
wider
and
entered
she
was
standing
by
her
but
she
turned
at
his
coming
turned
and
faced
him
he
came
straight
to
her
and
took
her
by
the
shoulders
what
is
the
matter
he
said
she
met
his
direct
look
but
there
was
shrinking
in
her
eyes
everard
she
said
there
are
times
when
you
make
me
afraid
why
he
said
she
could
not
put
it
into
words
she
made
a
piteous
gesture
with
her
clasped
hands
his
expression
changed
subtly
softening
i
ca
always
wear
kid
gloves
my
stella
he
said
when
there
is
rough
work
to
be
done
we
have
to
strip
to
the
waist
sometimes
to
get
to
it
it
the
only
way
to
get
a
sane
grip
on
things
her
lips
were
quivering
but
you
you
like
it
she
said
he
smiled
a
little
i
plead
guilty
to
a
sporting
instinct
he
said
you
hunt
down
murderers
and
call
it
sport
she
said
slowly
no
i
call
it
justice
he
still
spoke
gently
though
his
face
had
hardened
again
that
child
has
a
sense
of
justice
quite
elementary
but
a
true
one
if
i
could
get
hold
of
the
man
who
killed
ermsted
i
would
cheerfully
kill
him
with
my
own
hand
unless
i
could
be
sure
that
he
would
get
his
deserts
from
the
government
who
are
apt
to
be
somewhat
slack
in
such
matters
stella
shivered
again
do
you
know
everard
i
ca
bear
to
hear
you
talk
like
that
it
is
the
untamed
savage
part
of
you
he
drew
her
to
him
yes
the
soldier
part
i
know
i
know
quite
well
but
my
dear
do
me
the
justice
at
least
to
believe
that
i
am
on
the
side
of
right
i
ca
do
other
than
talk
generalities
to
you
you
simply
would
understand
but
there
are
some
criminals
who
can
only
be
beaten
with
their
own
weapons
remember
that
nicholson
knew
that
and
applied
it
i
follow
or
try
to
follow
in
nicholson
steps
she
clung
to
him
suddenly
and
closely
oh
do
do
this
is
another
age
we
have
advanced
since
then
have
we
he
said
sombrely
and
do
you
think
the
india
of
can
be
governed
by
weakness
any
more
successfully
than
the
india
of
nicholson
time
you
have
no
idea
what
you
say
when
you
talk
like
that
ermsted
is
not
the
first
englishman
to
be
killed
in
this
state
the
rajah
of
markestan
is
too
wily
a
beast
to
go
for
the
large
game
at
the
outset
though
probably
the
large
game
is
the
only
stuff
he
cares
about
he
knows
too
well
that
there
are
eyes
that
watch
perpetually
and
he
wo
expose
himself
if
he
can
help
it
the
trouble
is
he
always
know
where
to
look
for
the
eyes
that
watch
a
certain
exultation
sounded
in
his
voice
but
the
next
instant
he
bent
and
kissed
her
why
do
you
dwell
on
these
things
they
only
trouble
you
but
i
think
you
might
remember
that
since
they
exist
someone
has
to
deal
with
them
you
do
trust
ahmed
khan
she
said
you
think
he
is
treacherous
he
hesitated
then
ahmed
khan
is
either
a
tiger
or
merely
a
jackal
he
said
i
do
know
which
at
present
i
am
taking
his
measure
she
still
held
him
closely
everard
her
voice
came
low
and
breathless
you
think
he
was
responsible
for
captain
ermsted
death
may
he
not
have
been
also
for
for
he
checked
her
sharply
before
ralph
dacre
name
could
leave
her
lips
no
put
that
out
of
your
mind
for
good
you
have
no
reason
to
suspect
foul
play
where
he
was
concerned
he
spoke
with
such
decision
that
she
looked
at
him
in
surprise
i
often
have
suspected
it
she
said
i
know
but
you
have
no
reason
for
doing
so
i
should
try
to
forget
it
if
i
were
you
let
the
past
be
past
it
was
evident
that
he
would
not
discuss
the
matter
and
wondering
somewhat
she
let
it
pass
the
bare
mention
of
dacre
seemed
to
be
unendurable
to
him
but
the
suspicion
which
his
words
had
started
remained
in
her
mind
for
it
was
beyond
her
power
to
dismiss
it
the
conviction
that
he
had
met
his
death
by
foul
means
was
steadily
gaining
ground
within
her
winding
ever
more
closely
about
her
shrinking
heart
monck
went
his
way
whether
deeply
disappointed
or
not
she
knew
not
but
she
realized
that
he
would
not
reopen
the
subject
he
had
made
his
explanation
but
and
for
this
she
honoured
him
he
would
not
seek
to
convince
her
against
her
will
it
was
even
possible
that
he
preferred
her
to
keep
her
own
judgment
in
the
matter
they
dined
at
the
mansfields
bungalow
that
night
a
festivity
for
which
she
felt
small
relish
more
especially
as
she
knew
that
ralston
would
not
be
present
to
be
received
with
icy
ceremony
by
lady
harriet
and
sent
in
to
dinner
with
major
burton
was
a
state
of
affairs
that
must
have
dashed
the
highest
spirits
she
tried
to
make
the
best
of
it
but
it
was
impossible
to
be
entirely
unaffected
by
the
depressing
chill
of
the
atmosphere
conversation
turned
upon
ermsted
regarding
whom
the
report
had
gone
forth
that
she
was
very
seriously
lady
harriet
sought
to
probe
stella
upon
the
subject
and
was
plainly
offended
when
she
pleaded
ignorance
she
also
tried
to
extract
monck
opinion
of
poor
captain
ermsted
murder
had
it
been
committed
by
a
mere
for
the
sake
of
robbery
or
did
he
consider
that
any
political
significance
was
attached
to
it
monck
drily
expressed
the
opinion
that
something
might
be
said
for
either
theory
but
when
lady
harriet
threw
discretion
to
the
winds
and
desired
to
know
if
it
were
generally
believed
in
official
circles
that
the
rajah
was
implicated
he
raised
his
brows
in
stern
surprise
and
replied
that
so
far
as
his
information
went
the
rajah
was
a
loyal
servant
of
the
crown
lady
harriet
was
snubbed
and
she
felt
the
effects
of
it
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
walking
home
with
her
husband
through
the
starlight
later
stella
laughed
a
little
over
the
episode
but
monck
was
not
responsive
he
seemed
engrossed
in
thought
he
went
with
her
to
her
room
and
there
bade
her
observing
that
he
had
work
to
do
and
might
be
late
it
is
already
late
she
said
do
be
long
i
shall
only
lie
awake
till
you
come
he
frowned
at
her
i
shall
be
very
angry
if
you
do
i
ca
help
that
she
said
i
ca
sleep
properly
till
you
come
he
looked
her
in
the
eyes
you
not
nervous
you
got
peter
oh
i
am
not
in
the
least
nervous
on
my
own
account
she
told
him
you
need
be
on
mine
he
said
she
laughed
but
her
lips
were
piteous
well
do
be
long
anyway
she
pleaded
do
forget
i
am
waiting
for
you
forget
he
said
for
an
instant
his
hold
upon
her
was
passionate
he
kissed
her
fiercely
blindly
even
violently
then
with
a
muttered
word
of
inarticulate
apology
he
let
her
go
she
heard
him
stride
away
down
the
passage
and
in
a
few
moments
peter
came
and
very
softly
closed
the
door
she
knew
that
he
was
there
on
guard
until
his
master
should
return
she
sat
down
with
a
beating
heart
and
leaned
back
with
closed
eyes
a
heavy
sense
of
foreboding
oppressed
her
she
was
very
tired
but
yet
she
knew
that
sleep
was
far
away
just
as
once
she
had
felt
a
dread
that
was
physical
on
behalf
of
ralph
dacre
so
now
she
felt
weighed
down
by
suspense
and
loneliness
only
now
it
was
a
thousand
times
magnified
for
this
man
was
her
world
she
tried
to
picture
to
herself
what
it
would
have
meant
to
her
had
that
shot
in
the
jungle
slain
him
instead
of
captain
ermsted
but
the
bare
thought
was
beyond
endurance
once
she
could
have
borne
it
but
not
now
not
now
once
she
could
have
denied
her
love
and
fared
forth
alone
into
the
desert
but
he
had
captured
her
and
now
she
was
irrevocably
his
her
spirit
pined
almost
unconsciously
whenever
he
was
absent
from
her
her
body
knew
no
rest
without
him
from
the
moment
of
his
leaving
her
she
was
ever
secretly
on
fire
for
his
return
had
they
been
in
england
she
knew
that
it
would
have
been
otherwise
in
a
calm
and
temperate
atmosphere
she
could
have
attained
a
serene
unruffled
happiness
but
india
fevered
and
pitiless
held
her
in
scorching
grip
she
dwelt
as
it
were
on
the
edge
of
a
roaring
furnace
that
consumed
some
victims
every
day
her
life
was
strung
up
to
a
pitch
that
frightened
her
the
very
intensity
of
the
love
that
everard
monck
had
practically
forced
into
being
within
her
was
almost
more
than
she
could
bear
it
hurt
her
like
the
searing
of
a
flame
and
yet
in
the
hurt
there
was
rapture
for
the
icy
blast
of
the
desert
could
never
reach
her
now
unless
unless
ah
was
there
not
a
flaming
sword
still
threatening
her
wherever
she
pitched
her
camp
surround
herself
as
she
would
with
the
magic
essences
of
love
did
not
the
vengeance
await
her
even
now
even
now
could
she
ever
count
herself
safe
so
long
as
she
remained
in
this
land
of
treachery
and
terrible
vengeance
could
there
ever
be
any
peace
so
near
to
the
burning
fiery
furnace
slowly
the
night
wore
on
the
air
blew
in
cool
and
pure
with
a
soft
whispering
of
spring
and
the
brief
splendour
of
the
the
howl
of
a
prowling
jackal
came
now
and
then
to
her
ears
making
her
shiver
with
the
memory
of
monck
words
away
in
the
jungle
the
owls
were
calling
upon
notes
that
sounded
like
weird
cries
for
help
once
or
twice
she
heard
a
shuffling
movement
outside
the
door
and
knew
that
peter
was
still
on
guard
she
wondered
if
he
ever
slept
she
wondered
if
tommy
had
returned
he
often
dropped
into
the
club
on
his
way
back
and
sometimes
stayed
late
then
realizing
how
late
it
was
she
came
to
the
conclusion
that
she
must
have
dozed
in
her
chair
she
got
up
with
a
sense
of
being
weighted
in
every
limb
and
began
to
undress
everard
would
be
vexed
if
he
returned
and
found
her
still
up
not
that
she
expected
him
to
return
for
a
long
time
his
absence
lasted
sometimes
till
the
night
was
nearly
over
she
never
questioned
him
regarding
it
and
he
never
told
her
anything
dacre
revelation
on
that
night
so
long
ago
had
never
left
her
memory
he
was
engaged
upon
secret
affairs
possibly
he
was
down
in
the
native
quarter
disguised
as
a
native
carrying
his
life
in
his
hand
he
had
a
friend
in
the
bazaar
she
knew
a
man
she
had
never
seen
but
whose
shop
he
had
once
pointed
out
to
her
though
he
would
not
suffer
her
and
indeed
she
had
no
desire
to
enter
this
man
rustam
karin
was
a
dealer
in
native
charms
and
trinkets
the
business
was
mainly
conducted
by
a
youth
of
obsequious
and
insincere
demeanour
called
hafiz
the
latter
she
knew
and
instinctively
disliked
but
her
feeling
for
the
unknown
master
was
one
of
more
active
aversion
in
the
depths
of
that
dark
native
stall
she
pictured
him
a
watcher
furtive
and
avaricious
a
man
who
lent
himself
and
his
shrewd
and
covetous
brain
to
a
government
he
probably
despised
as
alien
tommy
had
once
described
the
man
to
her
and
her
conception
of
him
was
a
perfectly
clear
one
he
was
and
an
and
she
hated
to
think
of
everard
as
in
any
sense
allied
with
him
dark
treacherous
and
terrible
he
loomed
in
her
imagination
he
represented
india
and
all
her
subtleties
he
was
a
serpent
underfoot
a
knife
in
the
dark
an
evil
dream
she
could
not
have
said
why
the
personality
of
a
man
she
did
not
know
so
affected
her
save
that
she
believed
that
all
monck
secret
expeditions
were
conceived
in
the
gloom
of
that
stall
she
had
never
entered
in
the
heart
of
the
native
bazaar
the
man
was
in
monck
confidence
perhaps
being
a
woman
that
hurt
her
also
for
though
she
recognized
as
in
the
case
of
that
native
lair
down
in
the
bazaar
that
it
were
better
never
to
set
foot
in
that
secret
chamber
yet
she
resented
the
thought
that
any
other
should
have
free
access
to
it
she
was
beginning
to
regard
that
part
of
monck
life
with
a
dread
that
verged
upon
horror
a
feeling
which
her
very
love
for
the
man
but
served
to
intensify
she
was
as
one
clinging
desperately
to
a
treasure
which
might
at
any
moment
be
wrested
from
her
stiffly
and
wearily
she
undressed
tommy
must
surely
have
returned
ages
ago
though
probably
late
or
he
would
have
come
to
bid
her
why
did
not
everard
return
at
the
last
she
extinguished
her
light
and
went
to
the
window
to
gaze
wistfully
out
across
the
verandah
that
secret
whispering
the
stirring
of
a
thousand
unseen
things
was
abroad
in
the
night
the
air
was
soft
and
scented
with
a
fragrance
intangible
but
wholly
sweet
india
stretched
out
beneath
the
glittering
stars
stirred
with
eyes
and
smiled
stella
thought
she
heard
the
flutter
of
her
robe
then
again
the
mystery
of
the
night
was
rent
by
the
cry
of
some
beast
of
prey
and
in
a
second
the
magic
was
gone
the
shadows
were
full
of
evil
she
drew
back
with
swift
involuntary
shrinking
and
as
she
did
so
she
heard
the
dreadful
answering
cry
of
the
prey
that
had
been
seized
india
again
india
the
ruthless
india
the
bloodthirsty
india
the
vampire
for
a
few
palpitating
moments
she
leaned
against
the
wall
feeling
physically
sick
and
as
she
leaned
there
passed
before
her
inner
vision
the
memory
of
that
figure
which
she
had
seen
upon
the
verandah
on
that
terrible
night
when
everard
had
been
stricken
with
fever
the
look
in
her
husband
eyes
that
day
had
brought
it
back
to
her
and
now
like
a
flashlight
it
leapt
from
point
to
point
of
her
brain
revealing
illuminating
that
figure
on
the
verandah
and
the
unknown
man
of
the
bazaar
were
one
it
was
rustam
karin
whom
she
had
seen
that
night
rustam
karin
everard
trusted
friend
and
ally
the
rajah
tool
also
though
everard
would
never
have
it
so
and
she
was
certain
of
it
now
with
that
certainty
which
is
somehow
all
the
greater
because
without
proof
this
was
the
man
who
had
followed
ralph
dacre
to
kashmir
and
lured
him
to
his
death
this
was
the
beast
of
prey
who
when
the
time
was
ripe
would
destroy
everard
monck
also
chapter
iv
the
flaming
sword
the
conviction
which
came
upon
stella
on
that
night
of
chequered
starlight
was
one
which
no
amount
of
sane
reasoning
could
shake
she
made
no
attempt
to
reopen
the
subject
with
everard
recognizing
fully
the
futility
of
such
a
course
for
she
had
no
shadow
of
proof
to
support
it
but
it
hung
upon
her
like
a
heavy
chain
she
took
it
with
her
wherever
she
went
more
than
once
she
contemplated
taking
tommy
into
her
confidence
but
again
that
lack
of
proof
deterred
her
she
was
certain
that
tommy
would
give
no
credence
to
her
theory
and
his
faith
in
monck
his
wariness
his
discretion
was
unbounded
she
did
question
peter
with
regard
to
rustam
karin
but
she
elicited
scant
satisfaction
from
him
peter
went
but
little
to
the
native
bazaar
and
like
herself
had
never
seen
the
man
he
appeared
so
seldom
and
then
only
by
night
there
was
a
rumour
that
he
was
leprous
this
was
all
that
peter
knew
and
so
it
seemed
useless
to
pursue
the
matter
she
could
only
wait
and
watch
some
day
the
man
might
emerge
from
his
lair
and
she
would
be
able
to
identify
him
beyond
all
dispute
peter
could
help
her
then
but
till
then
there
was
nothing
that
she
could
do
she
was
quite
helpless
so
with
that
shrinking
still
strongly
upon
her
that
made
all
mention
of
ralph
dacre
death
so
difficult
she
buried
the
matter
deep
in
her
own
heart
determined
only
that
she
also
would
watch
with
a
vigilance
that
never
slackened
until
the
proof
for
which
she
waited
should
be
hers
the
weeks
had
begun
to
slip
by
with
incredible
swiftness
the
tragedy
of
ermsted
death
had
ceased
to
be
the
talk
of
the
station
tessa
had
gone
back
to
her
mother
who
still
remained
a
in
the
hospitable
care
netta
plans
seemed
to
be
of
the
vaguest
but
home
leave
was
due
to
major
ralston
the
following
year
and
it
seemed
likely
that
she
would
drift
on
till
then
and
return
in
their
company
stella
did
not
see
very
much
of
her
friend
in
those
days
netta
exacting
and
peevish
monopolized
much
of
the
latter
time
and
kept
her
effectually
at
a
distance
the
days
were
growing
hotter
moreover
and
her
energies
flagged
though
all
her
strength
was
concentrated
upon
concealing
the
fact
from
everard
for
already
the
annual
exodus
to
bhulwana
was
being
discussed
and
only
the
possibility
that
the
battalion
might
be
moved
to
a
healthier
spot
for
the
summer
had
deferred
it
for
so
long
stella
clung
to
this
possibility
with
a
hope
that
was
passionate
in
its
intensity
she
had
a
morbid
dread
of
separation
albeit
the
danger
she
feared
seemed
to
have
sunk
into
obscurity
during
the
weeks
that
had
intervened
if
there
yet
remained
unrest
in
the
state
it
was
below
the
surface
the
rajah
came
and
went
in
his
usual
romantic
way
played
polo
with
his
british
friends
danced
and
gracefully
flattered
their
wives
as
of
yore
on
one
occasion
only
did
he
ask
stella
for
a
dance
but
she
excused
herself
with
a
decision
there
was
no
mistaking
something
within
her
revolted
at
the
bare
idea
he
went
away
smiling
but
he
never
asked
her
again
definite
orders
for
the
move
to
udalkhand
arrived
at
length
and
stella
heart
rejoiced
the
place
was
situated
on
the
edge
of
a
river
a
brown
and
turgid
torrent
in
the
rainy
weather
but
no
more
than
a
torpid
muddy
stream
before
the
monsoon
a
native
town
and
temple
stood
upon
its
banks
but
a
sandy
road
wound
up
to
higher
ground
on
which
a
few
bungalows
stood
overlooking
the
grim
parched
desert
below
the
jungle
of
khanmulla
was
not
more
than
five
miles
distant
and
kurrumpore
itself
barely
ten
but
yet
stella
felt
as
if
a
load
had
been
lifted
from
her
surely
the
danger
here
would
be
more
remote
and
she
would
not
need
to
leave
her
husband
now
that
thought
set
her
very
heart
monck
said
but
little
upon
the
subject
he
was
more
than
ever
in
those
days
everyone
said
that
udalkhand
was
healthier
and
cooler
than
kurrumpore
and
he
did
not
contradict
the
statement
but
yet
stella
came
to
perceive
after
a
time
something
in
his
silence
which
she
found
unsatisfactory
she
believed
he
watched
her
narrowly
though
he
certainly
had
no
appearance
of
doing
so
and
the
suspicion
made
her
nervous
there
were
a
few
lady
harriet
among
the
number
who
condemned
udalkhand
from
the
outset
as
impossible
and
departed
for
bhulwana
without
attempting
to
spend
even
the
beginning
of
the
hot
season
there
netta
ermsted
also
decided
against
it
though
ralston
declared
her
intention
of
going
thither
and
she
and
tessa
departed
for
that
universal
haven
the
grand
stand
before
any
one
else
this
freed
ralston
but
stella
had
grown
a
little
apart
from
her
friend
during
that
period
at
kurrumpore
and
a
measure
of
reserve
hung
between
them
though
outwardly
they
were
unchanged
a
great
languor
had
come
upon
stella
which
seemed
to
press
all
the
more
heavily
upon
her
because
she
only
suffered
herself
to
indulge
it
in
everard
absence
when
he
was
present
she
was
almost
feverishly
active
but
it
needed
all
her
strength
of
will
to
achieve
this
and
she
had
no
energy
over
for
her
friends
even
after
the
move
to
udalkhand
had
been
accomplished
she
scarcely
felt
the
relief
which
she
so
urgently
needed
though
the
place
was
undoubtedly
more
airy
than
kurrumpore
the
air
came
from
the
desert
and
were
not
infrequent
she
made
a
brave
show
nevertheless
and
with
peter
help
turned
their
new
abode
into
as
dainty
a
as
any
could
desire
tommy
also
assisted
with
much
readiness
though
the
increasing
heat
was
anathema
to
him
also
he
was
more
considerate
for
his
sister
just
then
than
he
had
ever
been
before
often
in
monck
absence
he
would
spend
much
of
his
time
with
her
till
she
grew
to
depend
upon
him
to
an
extent
she
scarcely
realized
he
had
taken
up
in
his
leisure
hours
and
very
soon
she
was
fully
occupied
with
executing
elaborate
designs
for
his
workmanship
they
worked
very
happily
together
tommy
declared
it
kept
him
out
of
mischief
for
violent
exercise
never
suited
him
in
hot
weather
and
it
was
hot
every
day
seemed
to
bring
the
scorching
reality
of
summer
a
little
nearer
in
spite
of
herself
stella
flagged
more
and
more
tommy
always
kept
a
brave
front
he
was
full
of
devices
for
ameliorating
their
discomfort
he
kept
the
perpetually
at
his
task
he
made
the
spray
the
verandah
a
dozen
times
a
day
he
set
traps
for
the
flies
and
caught
them
in
their
swarms
but
he
could
not
take
the
sun
out
of
the
sky
which
day
by
day
shone
from
horizon
to
horizon
as
a
brazen
shield
burnished
to
an
intolerable
brightness
while
the
earth
parched
and
cracked
and
barren
fainted
beneath
it
the
nights
had
begun
to
be
oppressive
also
the
wind
from
the
desert
was
as
the
burning
breath
from
a
which
hourly
drew
a
little
nearer
stella
sometimes
felt
as
if
a
were
slowly
closing
upon
her
crushing
out
her
life
but
still
with
all
her
might
she
strove
to
hide
from
monck
the
ravages
of
the
cruel
heat
even
stooping
to
the
bitter
subterfuge
of
faintly
colouring
the
deathly
whiteness
of
her
cheeks
for
the
bloom
had
departed
long
since
as
netta
ermsted
had
predicted
though
her
beauty
remained
the
beauty
of
the
pure
white
rose
which
is
fairer
than
any
other
flower
that
grows
there
came
a
burning
day
at
last
however
when
she
realized
that
the
evening
drive
was
almost
beyond
her
powers
tommy
was
on
duty
at
the
barracks
everard
had
she
believed
gone
down
to
khanmulla
to
see
barnes
of
the
police
she
decided
in
the
absence
of
both
to
indulge
in
a
rest
and
sent
peter
to
countermand
the
carriage
then
a
great
heaviness
came
upon
her
and
she
yielded
herself
to
it
lying
inert
upon
the
couch
in
the
dully
listening
to
the
creak
of
the
punkah
that
stirred
without
cooling
the
late
afternoon
air
some
time
must
have
passed
thus
and
she
must
have
drifted
into
a
species
of
vague
dreaming
that
was
not
wholly
sleep
when
suddenly
there
came
a
sound
at
the
darkened
window
the
blind
was
lifted
and
monck
stood
in
the
opening
she
sprang
up
with
a
startled
sense
of
being
caught
off
her
guard
but
the
next
moment
a
great
dizziness
came
upon
her
and
she
reeled
back
groping
for
support
he
dropped
the
blind
and
caught
her
why
stella
he
said
she
clung
to
him
desperately
i
am
all
right
i
am
all
right
hold
me
a
minute
i
i
tripped
against
the
matting
gaspingly
she
uttered
the
words
hanging
upon
him
for
she
knew
she
could
not
stand
alone
he
put
her
gently
down
upon
the
sofa
take
it
quietly
dear
he
said
she
leaned
back
upon
the
cushions
with
closed
eyes
for
her
brain
was
swimming
i
am
all
right
she
reiterated
you
startled
me
a
little
i
did
expect
you
back
so
soon
i
met
barnes
just
after
i
started
he
made
answer
he
is
coming
to
dine
presently
her
heart
sank
is
he
she
said
faintly
no
monck
tone
suddenly
held
an
odd
note
that
was
and
on
second
thoughts
he
can
go
to
the
mess
with
tommy
i
do
think
i
want
him
any
more
than
you
do
she
opened
her
eyes
and
looked
up
at
him
everard
of
course
he
must
dine
here
if
you
have
asked
him
tell
peter
her
vision
was
still
slightly
blurred
but
she
saw
that
the
set
of
his
jaw
was
stubborn
he
stooped
after
a
moment
and
kissed
her
forehead
you
lie
still
he
said
and
mind
you
are
not
to
dress
for
dinner
he
turned
with
that
and
left
her
she
was
not
sorry
to
be
alone
for
her
head
was
throbbing
almost
unbearably
but
she
would
have
given
much
to
know
what
was
in
his
mind
she
lay
there
passively
till
presently
she
heard
tommy
dash
in
to
dress
for
mess
and
shortly
after
there
came
the
sound
of
men
voices
in
the
compound
and
she
knew
that
monck
and
barnes
were
walking
to
and
fro
together
she
got
up
then
summoning
her
energies
and
stole
to
her
own
room
monck
had
commanded
her
not
to
change
her
dress
but
the
haggardness
of
her
face
shocked
her
into
taking
refuge
in
the
remedy
which
she
secretly
despised
she
did
it
furtively
hoping
that
in
the
darkened
he
had
not
noted
the
ghastly
pallor
which
she
thus
sought
to
conceal
before
she
left
her
room
she
heard
tommy
and
barnes
departing
and
when
she
entered
the
monck
came
in
alone
at
the
window
and
joined
her
she
met
him
somewhat
nervously
for
she
thought
his
face
was
stern
but
when
he
spoke
his
voice
held
nought
but
kindness
and
she
was
reassured
he
did
not
look
at
her
with
any
very
close
criticism
nor
did
he
revert
to
what
had
passed
an
hour
before
they
were
served
by
peter
swiftly
and
silently
stella
making
a
valiant
effort
to
simulate
an
appetite
which
she
was
far
from
possessing
the
windows
were
wide
to
the
night
and
from
the
river
bank
below
there
came
the
thrumming
of
some
stringed
instrument
which
had
a
weird
and
strangely
poignant
throbbing
as
if
it
voiced
some
hidden
distress
there
were
a
thousand
sounds
besides
some
near
some
distant
but
it
penetrated
them
all
with
the
persistence
of
some
small
imprisoned
creature
working
perpetually
for
freedom
it
began
to
wear
upon
stella
nerves
at
last
it
was
so
futile
yet
so
pathetic
the
same
soft
minor
tinkle
only
a
few
stray
notes
played
over
and
over
over
and
over
till
her
brain
rang
with
the
maddening
little
refrain
she
was
glad
when
the
meal
was
over
and
she
could
make
the
excuse
to
move
to
the
there
was
a
piano
here
a
rickety
instrument
long
since
hammered
into
tunelessness
but
she
sat
down
before
it
anything
was
better
than
to
sit
and
listen
to
that
single
plaintive
little
voice
of
india
crying
in
the
night
she
thought
and
hoped
that
monck
would
smoke
his
cigarette
and
suffer
himself
to
be
lulled
into
somnolence
by
such
melody
as
she
was
able
to
extract
from
the
crazy
old
instrument
but
he
disappointed
her
he
smoked
indeed
lounging
out
in
the
verandah
while
she
sought
with
every
allurement
to
draw
him
in
and
charm
him
to
blissful
sleepy
contentment
but
it
presently
came
to
her
that
there
was
something
dogged
in
his
refusal
to
be
so
drawn
and
when
she
realized
that
she
brought
her
soft
to
a
summary
close
and
turned
round
to
him
with
just
a
hint
of
resentment
he
was
leaning
in
the
doorway
the
cigarette
gone
from
his
lips
his
face
was
turned
to
the
night
his
attitude
seemed
to
express
that
patience
which
attends
upon
iron
resolution
he
looked
at
her
over
his
shoulder
as
she
paused
why
do
you
sing
he
said
a
little
tremor
of
indignation
went
through
her
he
spoke
with
the
gentle
indulgence
of
one
who
humours
a
child
only
once
had
she
ever
sung
to
him
and
then
he
had
sat
in
such
utter
immobility
and
silence
that
she
had
questioned
with
herself
afterwards
if
he
had
cared
for
it
she
rose
with
a
wholly
unconscious
touch
of
majesty
i
have
no
voice
she
said
then
come
here
he
said
his
voice
was
still
absolutely
gentle
but
it
held
an
indefinable
something
that
made
her
raise
her
brows
she
went
to
him
nevertheless
and
he
put
his
hand
through
her
arm
and
drew
her
close
to
his
side
the
night
was
heavy
with
a
brooding
that
blotted
out
the
stars
the
little
twanging
instrument
down
by
the
river
was
silent
for
a
space
monck
did
not
speak
and
gradually
the
tension
went
out
of
stella
she
relaxed
at
length
and
laid
her
cheek
against
his
shoulder
his
arm
went
round
her
in
a
moment
he
held
her
against
his
heart
stella
he
said
do
you
ever
think
to
yourself
nowadays
that
i
am
a
very
formidable
person
to
live
with
never
she
said
his
arm
tightened
about
her
you
are
not
afraid
of
me
any
longer
she
smiled
a
little
what
is
this
leading
up
to
he
bent
suddenly
his
lips
against
her
forehead
dear
heart
if
i
am
wrong
forgive
me
but
why
are
you
trying
to
deceive
me
she
had
never
heard
such
tenderness
in
his
voice
before
it
thrilled
her
through
and
through
checking
her
first
involuntary
dismay
she
hid
her
face
upon
his
breast
clasping
him
close
trembling
from
head
to
foot
he
turned
still
holding
her
and
led
her
to
the
sofa
they
sat
down
together
poor
girl
he
said
softly
it
has
been
easy
has
it
then
she
realized
that
he
knew
all
that
she
had
so
strenuously
sought
to
hide
the
struggle
was
over
and
she
was
beaten
a
great
wave
of
emotion
went
through
her
before
she
could
check
herself
she
was
shaken
with
sobs
no
no
he
said
and
laid
his
hand
upon
her
head
you
must
cry
it
all
right
my
darling
it
all
right
what
is
there
to
cry
about
she
clung
faster
to
him
and
her
hold
was
passionate
everard
she
whispered
everard
i
ca
leave
you
ah
he
said
we
are
up
against
it
now
i
ca
she
said
again
i
ca
his
hand
was
softly
stroking
her
hair
such
tenderness
as
she
had
never
dreamed
of
was
in
his
touch
leave
off
crying
he
said
god
knows
i
want
to
make
things
easier
for
you
not
harder
i
can
bear
anything
she
told
him
brokenly
anything
in
the
world
if
only
i
am
with
you
i
ca
leave
you
you
wo
you
ca
force
me
to
that
stella
stella
he
said
his
voice
checked
her
she
knew
that
she
had
hurt
him
she
lifted
her
face
quickly
to
his
oh
darling
forgive
me
she
said
i
know
you
would
not
he
kissed
the
quivering
lips
she
raised
without
words
and
thereafter
there
fell
a
silence
between
them
while
the
mystery
of
the
night
seemed
to
press
closer
upon
them
and
the
veiled
goddess
turned
in
her
sleep
and
subtly
smiled
stella
uttered
a
long
long
sigh
at
last
you
are
good
to
bear
with
me
like
this
she
said
rather
piteously
better
now
he
questioned
gently
she
closed
her
eyes
from
the
grave
scrutiny
of
his
i
am
quite
all
right
dear
she
said
and
i
am
taking
great
care
of
myself
please
please
do
worry
about
me
his
hand
sought
and
found
hers
i
have
been
worrying
about
you
for
a
long
time
he
said
she
gave
a
start
of
surprise
i
never
thought
you
noticed
anything
yes
with
a
characteristic
touch
of
grimness
he
answered
her
i
noticed
when
you
first
began
to
colour
your
cheeks
for
my
benefit
i
knew
it
was
only
for
mine
or
of
course
i
should
have
been
furious
oh
everard
she
hid
her
face
against
him
again
with
a
little
shamed
laugh
he
went
on
without
mercy
i
am
not
an
easy
person
to
deceive
you
know
you
really
might
have
saved
yourself
the
trouble
i
hoped
you
would
give
in
sooner
that
too
would
have
saved
trouble
but
i
have
given
in
she
said
his
hand
closed
upon
hers
you
would
kill
yourself
first
if
i
would
let
you
he
said
but
do
you
think
i
am
going
to
do
that
it
would
kill
me
to
leave
you
she
said
and
what
if
it
kills
you
to
stay
he
spoke
with
sudden
force
no
listen
a
minute
i
have
something
to
tell
you
i
have
been
worried
about
you
as
i
said
for
some
time
i
was
working
in
the
and
ralston
chanced
to
come
in
he
asked
me
how
you
were
i
said
am
afraid
the
climate
is
against
her
what
do
you
think
of
her
he
replied
tell
you
what
i
think
of
you
if
you
like
i
think
a
damned
fool
that
opened
my
eyes
monck
ended
on
the
old
grim
note
i
thanked
him
for
the
information
and
told
him
to
come
over
here
and
see
you
on
the
earliest
opportunity
he
has
promised
to
come
round
in
the
morning
oh
but
everard
stella
started
up
in
swift
protest
i
do
want
him
i
wo
see
him
he
kept
her
hand
in
his
i
am
sorry
he
said
but
i
am
going
to
insist
on
that
you
insist
she
looked
at
him
curiously
a
quivering
smile
about
her
lips
his
eyes
met
hers
uncompromisingly
if
necessary
he
said
she
made
a
movement
to
free
herself
but
he
frustrated
her
gently
but
with
indisputable
mastery
stella
he
said
things
may
be
difficult
i
know
they
are
but
my
dear
do
make
them
impossible
let
us
pull
together
in
this
as
in
everything
else
she
met
his
look
steadily
you
know
what
will
happen
do
you
she
said
he
will
order
me
to
bhulwana
monck
hand
tightened
upon
hers
better
that
he
said
under
his
breath
than
to
lose
you
altogether
and
if
it
kills
me
to
leave
you
she
said
what
then
he
made
a
gesture
that
was
almost
violent
but
instantly
restrained
himself
i
think
you
are
braver
than
that
he
said
her
lips
quivered
again
piteously
i
am
not
brave
at
all
she
said
i
left
all
my
courage
all
my
faith
in
the
mountains
one
terrible
morning
when
god
cursed
me
for
marrying
a
man
i
did
not
love
and
took
the
man
away
my
darling
monck
said
he
drew
her
to
him
again
holding
her
passionately
close
kissing
the
trembling
lips
till
they
clung
to
his
in
answer
ca
you
forget
all
that
he
said
put
it
right
away
from
you
think
only
of
what
lies
before
her
arms
were
round
his
neck
she
poured
out
her
very
soul
to
him
in
that
close
embrace
but
she
said
no
word
in
answer
and
her
silence
was
the
silence
of
despair
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
flaming
sword
she
dreaded
had
flashed
again
across
her
path
closing
the
way
to
happiness
chapter
v
tessa
the
blue
jay
was
still
laughing
on
the
slopes
of
bhulwana
when
stella
returned
thither
it
was
glorious
summer
weather
there
was
life
in
the
air
such
life
as
never
reached
the
plains
the
bungalow
up
the
hill
called
the
nest
which
once
ralph
dacre
had
taken
for
his
bride
was
to
be
stella
home
for
the
period
of
her
sojourn
at
bhulwana
it
was
a
pretty
little
place
twined
in
roses
standing
in
a
shady
compound
that
tessa
called
the
jungle
tessa
became
at
once
her
most
constant
visitor
she
and
scooter
were
running
wild
as
usual
but
netta
was
living
in
strict
retirement
people
said
she
looked
very
ill
but
she
seemed
to
resent
all
sympathy
there
was
an
air
of
defiance
about
her
which
kept
most
people
at
a
distance
stories
were
rife
concerning
her
continued
intimacy
with
the
rajah
who
was
now
in
residence
at
his
summer
palace
on
the
hill
they
went
for
gallops
together
in
the
early
morning
and
in
the
evenings
they
sometimes
flashed
along
the
road
in
his
car
but
he
was
seldom
observed
to
enter
the
bungalow
she
occupied
and
even
tessa
had
no
private
information
to
add
to
the
general
gossip
netta
seldom
went
to
race
course
or
where
the
rajah
was
most
frequently
to
be
found
stella
who
had
never
liked
netta
ermsted
took
but
slight
interest
in
her
affairs
she
always
welcomed
tessa
however
and
presently
since
her
leisure
was
ample
and
her
health
considerably
improved
she
began
to
give
the
child
a
few
lessons
which
soon
became
the
joy
of
tessa
heart
she
found
her
quick
and
full
of
enthusiasm
her
devotion
to
stella
made
her
tractable
and
they
became
fast
friends
it
was
in
june
just
before
the
rains
that
monck
came
up
on
a
leave
he
found
tessa
practically
established
as
stella
companion
her
mother
took
no
interest
in
her
doings
the
was
responsible
for
her
safety
and
even
if
tessa
elected
to
spend
the
night
with
her
friend
netta
raised
no
objection
it
had
always
been
her
way
to
leave
the
child
to
any
who
cared
to
look
after
her
since
she
frankly
acknowledged
that
she
was
quite
incapable
of
managing
her
herself
if
monck
liked
to
be
bothered
with
her
it
was
obviously
her
affair
not
netta
and
so
stella
kept
the
little
girl
more
and
more
in
her
own
care
since
ralston
was
still
at
udalkhand
and
no
one
else
cared
in
the
smallest
degree
for
her
welfare
she
would
not
keep
her
for
good
though
so
far
as
her
mother
was
concerned
she
might
easily
have
done
so
but
she
did
occasionally
as
a
great
treat
have
her
to
sleep
with
her
generally
when
tessa
looks
proclaimed
her
to
be
in
urgent
need
of
a
long
night
for
she
was
almost
always
late
to
bed
when
at
home
refusing
to
retire
before
her
mother
though
there
was
little
of
companionship
between
them
at
any
time
stella
investigated
this
resolution
on
one
occasion
and
finally
extracted
from
tessa
the
admission
that
she
was
afraid
to
go
to
bed
early
lest
her
mother
should
go
out
unexpectedly
in
which
event
the
would
certainly
retire
to
the
servants
quarters
and
she
would
be
alone
in
the
bungalow
no
amount
of
reasoning
on
stella
part
could
shake
this
dread
tessa
nerves
were
strung
to
a
high
pitch
and
it
was
evident
that
she
felt
very
strongly
on
the
subject
so
out
of
sheer
pity
stella
sometimes
kept
her
at
the
nest
and
tessa
gratitude
knew
no
bounds
she
was
growing
fast
and
ought
to
have
been
in
england
for
the
past
year
at
least
but
netta
plans
were
still
vague
she
supposed
she
would
have
to
go
when
the
ralstons
did
but
she
saw
no
reason
for
hurry
lady
harriet
remonstrated
with
her
on
the
subject
but
obtained
no
satisfaction
netta
was
her
own
mistress
now
and
meant
to
please
herself
monck
arrived
late
one
evening
on
the
day
before
that
on
which
he
was
expected
and
found
tessa
and
peter
playing
with
a
ball
in
the
compound
the
two
were
fast
friends
and
stella
often
left
tessa
in
his
charge
while
she
rested
she
was
resting
now
lying
in
her
own
room
with
a
book
when
suddenly
the
sound
of
tessa
voice
raised
in
excited
welcome
reached
her
she
heard
monck
quiet
voice
make
reply
and
started
up
with
every
pulse
quivering
she
had
not
seen
him
for
nearly
six
weeks
she
met
him
in
the
verandah
with
tessa
hanging
on
his
arm
since
her
great
love
for
stella
had
developed
she
had
adopted
stella
husband
also
as
her
own
especial
property
though
it
could
scarcely
be
said
that
monck
gave
her
much
encouragement
on
this
occasion
she
simply
ceased
to
exist
for
him
the
moment
he
caught
sight
of
stella
face
and
even
stella
herself
forgot
the
child
in
the
first
rapture
of
greeting
but
later
tessa
asserted
herself
again
with
a
determination
that
would
not
be
ignored
she
begged
hard
to
be
allowed
to
remain
for
the
night
but
this
stella
refused
to
permit
though
her
heart
smote
her
somewhat
when
she
saw
her
finally
take
her
departure
with
many
wistful
backward
glances
monck
was
enough
to
smile
let
the
imp
go
she
has
had
more
than
her
share
already
he
said
i
not
going
to
divide
you
with
any
one
under
the
sun
stella
was
lying
on
the
sofa
she
reached
out
and
held
his
hand
leaning
her
cheek
against
his
sleeve
except
she
murmured
he
bent
to
her
his
lips
upon
her
shining
hair
ah
i
have
begun
to
do
that
already
he
said
with
a
touch
of
sadness
i
wonder
if
you
are
as
lonely
up
here
as
i
am
at
udalkhand
she
kissed
his
sleeve
i
miss
you
unspeakably
she
said
his
fingers
closed
upon
hers
stella
can
you
keep
a
secret
she
looked
up
swiftly
of
course
of
course
what
is
it
have
they
made
you
of
the
province
he
smiled
grimly
not
yet
but
sir
reginald
bassett
you
know
old
sir
reggie
came
and
inspected
us
the
other
day
and
we
had
a
talk
he
is
one
of
the
keenest
that
i
ever
met
an
odd
thrill
sounded
in
monck
voice
he
asked
me
if
presently
when
the
vacancy
occurred
i
would
be
his
secretary
his
political
adviser
as
he
put
it
stella
it
would
be
a
mighty
big
step
up
it
would
lead
it
might
lead
to
great
things
oh
my
darling
she
was
quivering
all
over
would
it
would
it
mean
that
we
should
be
together
no
she
caught
herself
up
sharply
that
is
sheer
selfishness
i
should
have
asked
that
first
his
lips
pressed
hers
do
you
know
it
is
the
one
thing
that
comes
first
of
all
with
me
too
he
said
yes
it
would
mean
far
less
of
separation
it
would
probably
mean
simla
in
the
hot
weather
and
only
short
absences
for
me
it
would
mean
an
end
of
this
beastly
regimental
life
that
you
hate
so
badly
what
did
you
think
i
did
know
that
but
it
would
also
mean
leaving
poor
tommy
at
the
grindstone
which
is
hard
dear
tommy
but
he
has
lots
of
friends
you
do
think
he
would
get
up
to
mischief
no
i
do
think
so
he
is
more
of
a
man
than
he
was
and
i
could
keep
an
eye
on
him
even
from
a
distance
still
it
wo
come
yet
not
probably
till
the
end
of
the
year
you
are
fairly
comfortable
here
you
and
peter
she
smiled
and
sighed
oh
yes
he
keeps
away
the
bogies
and
tessa
chases
off
the
blues
so
i
am
well
taken
care
of
i
hope
you
do
let
that
child
wear
you
out
monck
said
she
is
rather
a
handful
why
do
you
leave
her
to
her
mother
because
she
is
utterly
unfit
to
have
the
care
of
her
stella
spoke
with
very
unusual
severity
since
captain
ermsted
death
she
seems
to
have
drifted
into
a
state
of
hopeless
apathy
i
ca
bear
to
think
of
a
susceptible
child
like
tessa
brought
up
in
such
an
atmosphere
apathetic
is
she
do
you
often
see
her
monck
spoke
casually
as
he
rolled
a
cigarette
very
seldom
she
goes
out
very
little
and
then
only
with
the
rajah
they
say
she
looks
ill
but
that
is
not
surprising
she
does
lead
a
wholesome
life
she
keeps
up
her
intimacy
with
his
excellency
then
monck
still
spoke
as
if
his
thoughts
were
elsewhere
stella
dismissed
the
subject
with
a
touch
of
impatience
she
had
no
desire
to
waste
any
precious
moments
over
idle
gossip
i
imagine
so
but
i
really
know
very
little
i
do
encourage
tessa
to
talk
as
you
know
i
never
could
bear
the
man
monck
smiled
a
little
i
know
you
are
discretion
itself
he
said
but
you
are
not
to
adopt
tessa
mind
whatever
the
state
of
her
morals
ah
but
i
must
do
what
i
can
for
the
poor
waif
stella
protested
there
is
much
that
i
can
do
when
i
am
away
from
you
not
much
i
mean
that
is
worth
while
all
right
monck
said
with
finality
so
long
as
you
do
adopt
her
stella
saw
that
he
did
not
mean
to
allow
tessa
a
very
large
share
of
her
attention
during
his
leave
she
did
not
dispute
the
point
knowing
that
he
could
be
as
adamant
when
he
had
formed
a
resolution
but
she
did
not
feel
happy
about
the
child
there
was
to
her
something
tragic
about
tessa
as
if
the
evil
fate
that
had
overtaken
the
father
brooded
like
a
dark
cloud
over
her
also
her
mind
was
not
at
rest
concerning
her
in
the
morning
however
tessa
arrived
upon
the
scene
impudent
and
cheerful
and
she
felt
reassured
her
next
anxiety
became
to
keep
her
from
annoying
monck
upon
whom
naturally
tessa
main
attention
was
centered
tessa
however
was
in
an
unusually
tiresome
mood
she
refused
to
be
contented
with
the
society
of
the
peter
repudiated
the
bare
idea
of
lesson
books
and
set
herself
with
fiendish
ingenuity
to
torment
the
into
exasperation
stella
could
have
wept
over
her
intractability
she
had
never
before
found
her
difficult
to
manage
but
netta
perversity
and
devilry
were
uppermost
in
her
that
day
and
when
at
last
monck
curtly
ordered
her
not
to
worry
herself
but
to
leave
the
child
alone
she
gave
up
her
efforts
in
despair
tessa
was
riding
for
a
fall
it
came
eventually
after
two
hours
provocation
on
her
part
and
stern
patience
on
monck
stella
at
work
in
the
heard
a
sudden
sharp
exclamation
from
the
verandah
where
monck
was
seated
before
a
table
littered
with
hindu
literature
and
looked
up
to
see
tessa
with
a
grin
of
mischief
smoking
the
cigarette
which
she
had
just
snatched
from
between
monck
lips
she
was
dancing
on
one
leg
just
out
of
reach
ready
to
take
instant
flight
should
the
occasion
require
stella
was
on
the
point
of
starting
up
to
intervene
but
monck
stopped
her
with
a
word
he
was
quieter
than
she
had
ever
seen
him
and
that
fact
of
itself
warned
her
that
he
was
angry
at
last
come
here
he
said
to
tessa
tessa
removed
the
cigarette
to
poke
her
tongue
out
at
him
and
continued
her
just
out
of
reach
it
was
netta
to
the
life
monck
glanced
at
the
watch
on
his
wrist
i
give
you
one
minute
he
said
and
returned
to
his
work
why
do
you
chase
me
gibed
tessa
he
said
nothing
further
but
to
stella
his
silence
was
ominous
she
watched
him
with
anxious
eyes
tessa
continued
to
smoke
and
dance
posturing
like
a
in
front
of
the
wholly
unresponsive
and
unappreciative
monck
the
minute
passed
stella
counting
the
seconds
with
a
throbbing
heart
monck
did
not
raise
his
eyes
or
stir
but
there
was
to
her
something
dreadful
in
his
utter
stillness
she
marvelled
at
tessa
temerity
tessa
continued
to
dance
and
jeer
till
suddenly
finding
that
she
was
making
no
headway
a
demon
of
temper
entered
into
her
she
turned
in
a
fury
sprang
from
the
verandah
to
the
compound
snatched
up
a
handful
of
small
stones
and
flung
them
full
at
the
impassive
monck
they
fell
around
him
in
a
shower
he
looked
up
at
last
what
ensued
was
almost
too
swift
for
stella
vision
to
follow
she
saw
him
leap
the
and
heard
tessa
shrill
scream
of
fright
then
he
had
the
offender
in
his
grasp
and
stella
saw
the
deadly
determination
of
his
face
as
he
turned
in
spite
of
herself
she
sprang
up
but
again
his
voice
checked
her
all
right
this
is
my
job
bring
me
the
strap
off
the
bag
in
my
room
everard
she
cried
aghast
tessa
was
struggling
madly
for
freedom
he
mastered
her
as
he
would
have
mastered
a
refractory
puppy
carrying
her
up
the
steps
ignominiously
under
his
arm
do
as
i
say
he
commanded
and
against
her
will
stella
turned
and
obeyed
she
fetched
the
strap
but
she
held
it
back
when
he
stretched
a
hand
for
it
everard
she
is
only
a
child
you
wo
you
wo
flay
her
with
it
he
suggested
and
she
saw
his
brief
ironic
smile
not
at
present
hand
it
over
she
gave
it
reluctantly
tessa
squealed
a
wild
remonstrance
the
merciless
grip
that
held
her
had
sent
terror
to
her
heart
monck
still
deadly
quiet
set
her
on
her
feet
against
one
of
the
wooden
posts
that
supported
the
roof
of
the
verandah
passed
the
strap
round
her
waist
and
buckled
it
firmly
behind
the
post
then
he
stood
up
and
looked
again
at
the
watch
on
his
wrist
two
hours
he
said
briefly
and
went
back
to
his
work
at
the
other
end
of
the
verandah
stella
went
back
to
the
and
it
was
useless
to
interfere
she
saw
but
the
punishment
though
richly
deserved
was
a
heavy
one
and
she
wondered
how
tessa
the
wrought
up
to
a
high
pitch
of
nervous
excitement
as
she
was
would
stand
it
the
thickness
of
the
post
to
which
she
was
fastened
made
it
impossible
for
her
to
free
herself
the
strap
was
a
very
stout
one
and
the
buckle
such
as
only
a
man
fingers
could
loosen
it
was
an
undignified
position
and
tessa
valued
her
dignity
as
a
rule
she
cast
it
to
the
winds
on
this
occasion
however
for
she
fought
like
a
wild
cat
for
freedom
and
when
at
length
her
absolute
helplessness
was
made
quite
clear
even
to
her
she
went
into
a
paroxysm
of
fury
hurling
every
kind
of
invective
that
occurred
to
her
at
monck
who
with
the
grimness
of
an
executioner
sat
at
his
table
in
unbroken
silence
having
exhausted
her
vocabulary
both
english
and
hindustani
tessa
broke
at
last
into
tears
and
wept
stormily
for
many
minutes
monck
sat
through
the
storm
without
raising
his
eyes
from
the
stella
watched
him
she
was
no
longer
afraid
of
any
unconsidered
violence
he
was
completely
master
of
himself
but
she
thought
there
was
a
hint
of
cruelty
about
him
notwithstanding
there
was
ruthlessness
in
his
utter
immobility
the
hour
for
drew
near
peter
came
out
on
to
the
verandah
to
lay
the
cloth
monck
gathered
up
books
and
papers
and
rose
the
great
sikh
looked
at
the
child
shaken
with
passionate
sobbing
in
the
corner
of
the
verandah
and
from
her
to
monck
with
a
touch
of
ferocity
in
his
dark
eyes
monck
met
the
look
with
a
frown
and
turned
away
without
a
word
he
passed
down
the
verandah
to
his
own
room
and
peter
with
hands
that
shook
slightly
proceeded
with
his
task
tessa
sobbing
died
down
and
there
fell
a
strained
silence
stella
still
sat
in
the
but
she
was
out
of
sight
of
the
two
on
the
verandah
she
could
only
hear
peter
soft
movements
suddenly
she
heard
a
tense
whisper
peter
peter
quick
like
a
shadow
peter
crossed
her
line
of
vision
she
heard
a
murmured
missy
and
rising
she
bent
forward
and
saw
him
in
the
act
of
severing
tessa
bond
with
the
it
was
done
in
a
few
seconds
the
child
was
free
peter
turned
in
triumph
and
found
monck
standing
at
the
other
end
of
the
verandah
looking
at
him
stella
stepped
out
at
the
same
moment
and
saw
him
also
she
felt
the
blood
rush
to
her
heart
only
once
had
she
seen
monck
look
as
he
looked
now
and
that
on
an
occasion
of
which
even
yet
she
never
willingly
suffered
herself
to
think
peter
triumph
wilted
run
missy
he
said
in
a
hurried
whisper
and
moved
himself
to
meet
the
wrath
of
the
gods
tessa
did
not
run
neither
did
she
spring
to
stella
for
protection
she
stood
for
a
second
or
two
in
indecision
then
with
an
odd
little
strangled
cry
she
darted
in
front
of
peter
and
went
straight
to
monck
it
it
was
peter
fault
she
declared
breathlessly
i
told
him
to
monck
eyes
went
over
her
head
to
the
native
beyond
her
he
spoke
a
few
brief
words
in
the
man
own
language
and
peter
winced
as
though
he
had
been
struck
with
a
whip
and
bent
himself
in
an
attitude
of
the
most
profound
humility
monck
spoke
again
curtly
and
as
if
at
the
sudden
jerk
of
a
string
the
man
straightened
himself
and
went
away
then
tessa
weeping
threw
herself
upon
monck
do
please
not
be
angry
with
him
it
was
all
my
fault
you
you
you
can
whip
me
if
you
like
only
you
must
be
cross
with
peter
it
is
it
is
fair
he
stood
stiffly
for
a
few
seconds
as
if
he
would
resist
her
and
stella
leaned
against
the
feeling
physically
sick
as
she
watched
him
then
abruptly
his
eyes
came
to
hers
and
she
saw
his
face
change
he
put
his
hand
on
tessa
shoulder
if
you
want
forgiveness
for
yourself
and
peter
he
said
grimly
go
back
to
your
corner
and
stay
there
tessa
lifted
her
face
looked
at
him
closely
for
a
moment
then
turned
submissively
and
went
back
monck
came
down
the
verandah
to
his
wife
he
put
his
arm
around
her
and
drew
her
within
why
are
you
trembling
he
said
she
leaned
her
head
against
him
everard
what
did
you
say
to
peter
never
mind
said
monck
she
braced
herself
you
are
not
to
be
angry
with
him
he
is
my
servant
i
will
reprimand
him
if
necessary
it
is
said
monck
with
a
brief
smile
you
can
tell
him
to
finish
laying
the
cloth
he
kissed
her
and
let
her
go
leaving
her
with
a
strong
impression
that
she
had
behaved
foolishly
if
it
had
not
been
for
that
which
she
had
seen
in
his
eyes
for
those
few
awful
seconds
she
would
have
despised
herself
for
her
utter
imbecility
but
the
memory
was
one
which
she
could
not
shake
from
her
she
did
not
wonder
that
even
peter
proud
sikh
as
he
was
had
quailed
before
that
look
would
monck
have
accepted
even
tessa
appeal
if
he
had
not
found
her
watching
she
wondered
she
wondered
she
did
not
look
forward
to
the
meal
on
the
verandah
but
monck
realized
this
and
had
it
laid
in
the
instead
at
his
command
peter
carried
a
plate
out
to
tessa
but
it
came
back
untouched
peter
explaining
in
a
very
low
voice
that
was
not
hungry
the
man
attitude
was
abject
he
watched
monck
furtively
from
behind
stella
chair
obeying
his
every
behest
with
a
promptitude
that
expressed
the
most
complete
submission
monck
bestowed
no
attention
upon
him
he
smiled
a
little
when
stella
expressed
concern
over
tessa
failure
to
eat
anything
it
was
evident
that
he
felt
no
anxiety
on
that
score
himself
leave
the
imp
alone
he
said
you
are
not
to
worry
yourself
about
her
any
more
you
have
done
more
than
enough
in
that
line
already
there
was
insistence
in
his
tone
an
insistence
which
he
maintained
later
when
he
made
her
lie
down
for
her
afternoon
rest
steadily
refusing
to
let
her
go
near
the
delinquent
until
she
had
had
it
greatly
against
her
will
she
yielded
the
point
protesting
that
she
could
not
sleep
nevertheless
but
when
he
had
gone
she
realized
that
the
happenings
of
the
morning
had
wearied
her
more
than
she
knew
she
was
very
tired
and
she
fell
into
a
deep
sleep
which
lasted
for
nearly
two
hours
awakening
from
this
she
got
up
with
some
compunction
at
having
left
the
child
so
long
and
went
to
her
window
to
look
for
her
she
found
the
corner
of
tessa
punishment
empty
a
little
further
along
the
verandah
monck
lounged
in
a
deep
cane
chair
and
curled
in
his
arms
asleep
with
her
head
against
his
neck
was
tessa
monck
eyes
were
fixed
straight
before
him
he
was
evidently
deep
in
thought
but
the
grim
lines
about
his
mouth
were
softened
and
even
as
stella
looked
he
stirred
a
little
very
cautiously
to
ease
the
position
something
in
the
action
sent
the
tears
to
her
eyes
she
went
back
into
her
room
asking
herself
how
she
had
ever
doubted
for
a
moment
the
goodness
of
his
heart
somewhere
down
the
hill
the
blue
jay
was
laughing
hilariously
scoffingly
as
one
who
marked
with
cynical
amusement
the
passing
show
of
life
and
a
few
seconds
later
the
rajah
car
flashed
past
carrying
the
rajah
and
a
woman
wearing
a
cloudy
veil
that
streamed
far
out
behind
her
chapter
vi
the
arrival
two
months
later
on
a
dripping
evening
in
august
monck
stood
alone
on
the
verandah
of
his
bungalow
at
udalkhand
with
a
letter
from
stella
in
his
hand
he
had
hurried
back
from
duty
on
purpose
to
secure
it
knowing
that
it
would
be
awaiting
him
she
had
become
accustomed
to
the
separation
now
though
she
spoke
yearningly
of
his
next
leave
ralston
had
joined
her
and
she
wrote
quite
cheerfully
she
was
very
well
and
looking
forward
oh
so
much
to
the
winter
there
was
certainly
no
sadness
to
be
detected
between
the
lines
and
monck
folded
up
the
letter
and
looked
across
the
dripping
compound
with
a
smile
in
his
eyes
when
the
winter
came
he
would
probably
have
taken
up
his
new
appointment
sir
reginald
bassett
a
man
of
immense
influence
and
energy
was
actually
in
udalkhand
at
that
moment
he
was
ostensibly
paying
a
friendly
visit
at
the
colonel
bungalow
but
monck
knew
well
what
it
was
that
had
brought
him
to
that
steaming
corner
of
markestan
in
the
very
worst
of
the
rainy
season
he
had
come
to
make
some
definite
arrangement
with
him
probably
before
that
very
night
was
over
he
would
have
begun
to
gather
the
fruit
of
his
ambition
he
had
started
already
to
climb
the
ladder
and
he
would
raise
stella
with
him
stella
and
that
other
being
upon
whom
he
sometimes
suffered
his
thoughts
to
dwell
with
a
contemplation
as
his
son
a
fantastic
fascination
hung
about
the
thought
he
could
not
yet
visualize
himself
as
a
father
it
was
easier
far
to
picture
stella
as
a
mother
but
yet
like
a
magnet
drawing
him
the
vision
seemed
to
beckon
he
walked
the
desert
with
a
lighter
step
and
tommy
swore
that
he
was
growing
younger
there
was
an
enclosure
in
stella
letter
from
tessa
who
called
him
her
darling
uncle
everard
and
begged
him
to
come
soon
and
see
how
good
she
was
getting
he
smiled
a
little
over
this
also
but
with
a
touch
of
wonder
the
child
worship
seemed
extraordinary
to
him
his
conquest
of
tessa
had
been
quite
complete
but
it
was
odd
that
in
consequence
of
it
she
should
love
him
as
she
loved
no
one
else
on
earth
yet
that
she
did
so
was
an
indubitable
fact
her
devotion
exceeded
even
that
of
tommy
which
was
saying
much
she
seemed
to
regard
him
as
a
sacred
being
and
her
greatest
pleasure
in
life
was
to
do
him
service
he
put
her
letter
away
also
reflecting
that
he
must
manage
somehow
to
make
time
to
answer
it
as
he
did
so
he
heard
tommy
voice
hail
him
from
the
compound
and
in
a
moment
the
boy
raced
into
sight
taking
the
verandah
steps
at
a
hop
skip
and
jump
hullo
old
chap
admiring
the
view
eh
what
got
some
letters
have
you
heard
from
your
brother
yet
not
a
word
for
weeks
monck
turned
to
meet
him
i
ca
think
what
has
happened
to
him
ca
you
though
i
can
tommy
seized
him
impetuously
by
the
shouders
he
was
rocking
with
laughter
oh
everard
old
boy
this
beats
everything
that
brother
of
yours
is
coming
along
the
road
now
and
travelled
all
the
way
from
khanmulla
in
a
in
a
what
monck
stared
in
amazement
are
you
mad
he
inquired
no
no
it
true
go
and
see
for
yourself
man
they
just
getting
here
slow
and
sure
he
must
be
well
stocked
with
patience
come
on
they
stopping
at
the
gate
now
he
dragged
his
to
the
steps
monck
went
of
a
hoax
but
he
had
barely
reached
the
path
below
when
through
the
rain
there
came
the
sound
of
wheels
and
heavy
jingling
come
on
yelled
tommy
it
too
good
to
miss
but
ere
they
arrived
at
the
gate
it
was
blocked
by
a
massive
figure
in
a
streaming
black
mackintosh
carrying
a
huge
umbrella
i
say
said
a
soft
voice
what
a
damn
jolly
part
of
the
world
to
live
in
bernard
monck
voice
sounded
incredulous
yet
he
passed
tommy
at
a
bound
hullo
my
boy
hullo
cheerily
the
newcomer
made
answer
how
do
you
open
this
beastly
gate
oh
i
see
swelled
a
bit
from
the
rain
i
must
see
to
that
for
you
presently
hullo
everard
i
chanced
to
find
myself
in
this
direction
so
thought
i
would
look
up
you
and
your
wife
how
are
you
my
boy
an
immense
hand
came
forth
and
grasped
monck
a
merry
red
face
beamed
at
him
from
under
the
great
umbrella
twinkling
eyes
with
red
lashes
shone
with
the
utmost
monck
gripped
the
hand
as
if
he
would
never
let
it
go
but
my
good
man
you
mad
to
come
here
were
the
only
words
of
welcome
he
found
to
utter
think
so
a
humorous
chuckle
accompanied
the
words
well
take
me
indoors
and
give
me
a
drink
there
are
a
few
traps
in
the
cart
outside
had
we
better
collect
first
i
see
to
them
volunteered
tommy
whose
sense
of
humour
was
still
somewhat
out
of
control
take
him
in
out
of
the
rain
everard
send
the
along
he
was
gone
with
the
words
and
everard
with
his
brother
hand
pulled
through
his
arm
piloted
him
up
to
the
bungalow
in
the
shelter
of
the
verandah
they
faced
each
other
the
one
brother
square
and
powerful
so
broad
as
to
make
his
height
appear
insignificant
the
other
brown
lean
muscular
a
soldier
in
every
line
his
dark
resolute
face
a
strange
contrast
to
the
ruddy
open
countenance
of
the
man
who
was
the
only
near
relation
he
possessed
in
the
world
well
boy
i
believe
you
grown
the
elder
brother
surveyed
the
younger
with
his
shrewd
twinkling
eyes
by
jove
i
sure
you
have
i
used
not
to
have
to
look
up
to
you
like
this
is
it
this
devilish
climate
that
does
it
and
what
on
earth
do
you
live
on
you
look
a
positive
skeleton
oh
that
india
yes
everard
brushed
aside
all
personal
comment
as
superfluous
come
along
in
and
refresh
what
particular
star
have
you
fallen
from
and
why
in
thunder
did
you
say
you
were
coming
the
elder
man
laughed
slapping
him
on
the
shoulder
with
hearty
force
his
face
was
as
free
from
care
as
a
boy
he
looked
as
if
life
had
dealt
kindly
with
him
ah
i
know
you
he
said
would
you
have
written
off
if
you
had
cabled
and
said
till
the
rains
are
over
but
i
had
raised
my
anchor
and
i
did
mean
to
wait
so
i
dispensed
with
your
brotherly
counsel
and
here
i
am
you
wo
find
me
in
the
way
at
all
i
dashed
good
at
effacing
myself
my
dear
good
chap
everard
said
you
about
the
only
man
in
the
world
who
need
never
think
of
doing
that
bernard
laugh
was
good
to
hear
who
taught
you
to
turn
such
a
pretty
compliment
where
is
your
wife
i
want
to
see
her
you
do
suppose
i
keep
her
in
this
filthy
place
do
you
everard
was
pouring
out
a
drink
as
he
spoke
no
no
she
has
been
at
bhulwana
in
the
hills
for
the
past
three
months
now
bernard
is
this
as
you
like
it
the
big
man
took
the
glass
looking
at
him
with
a
smile
of
kindly
criticism
well
you
wo
bore
each
other
at
that
rate
anyhow
he
remarked
here
to
you
both
i
drink
to
the
greatest
thing
in
life
he
drank
deeply
and
set
down
the
glass
look
here
you
just
off
to
mess
do
let
me
keep
you
all
i
want
is
a
cold
bath
and
then
if
you
got
a
spare
shakedown
of
any
sort
going
to
bed
is
mere
ritual
with
me
i
can
sleep
on
my
head
anywhere
you
sleep
in
a
decent
bed
declared
everard
but
you
coming
along
to
mess
with
me
first
oh
yes
you
are
of
course
you
are
an
hour
before
us
yet
though
hullo
tommy
let
me
introduce
you
formally
to
my
brother
bernard
my
tommy
denvers
tommy
came
in
through
the
window
and
shook
hands
with
much
heartiness
the
is
seeing
to
everything
pleased
to
meet
you
sir
beastly
wet
for
you
i
afraid
but
there
worse
things
than
rain
in
india
hope
you
had
a
decent
voyage
bernard
laughed
in
his
easy
fashion
like
the
niggers
i
can
make
myself
comfortable
most
anywheres
we
had
rather
a
foul
time
after
leaving
aden
ratting
in
the
hold
was
our
main
excitement
when
we
were
sweating
at
the
pumps
oh
no
i
did
come
over
in
one
of
your
majestic
liners
i
have
a
sailor
soul
a
flicker
of
admiration
shot
through
the
merriment
in
tommy
eyes
wish
i
had
he
observed
but
the
very
thought
of
the
sea
turns
mine
upside
down
if
you
keen
on
ratting
there
plenty
of
sport
of
that
kind
to
be
had
here
the
brutes
hold
gymkhanas
on
the
verandah
every
night
i
sit
up
with
a
gun
sometimes
when
everard
is
out
of
the
way
yes
he
a
peaceful
person
to
live
with
remarked
everard
have
something
to
eat
st
bernard
no
no
thanks
my
appetite
will
keep
a
cold
bath
is
my
most
pressing
need
can
i
have
that
sure
said
tommy
you
coming
to
mess
with
us
of
course
old
reggie
bassett
is
honouring
us
with
his
presence
it
will
be
a
historic
occasion
eh
everard
he
smiled
upon
the
elder
brother
with
obvious
pleasure
at
the
prospect
bernard
monck
always
met
with
a
welcome
wherever
he
went
and
tommy
was
prepared
to
like
any
one
belonging
to
everard
it
was
good
too
to
see
everard
with
that
eager
light
in
his
eyes
during
the
whole
of
their
acquaintance
he
had
never
seen
him
look
so
young
bernard
held
a
somewhat
different
opinion
however
and
as
he
found
himself
alone
again
with
his
brother
he
took
him
by
the
shoulders
and
held
him
for
a
closer
survey
what
has
india
been
doing
to
you
dear
fellow
he
said
you
look
about
as
ancient
as
the
sphinx
been
working
like
a
all
this
time
perhaps
everard
smile
held
something
of
restraint
we
ca
all
of
us
stand
still
bernard
perpetual
youth
is
given
only
to
the
favoured
few
ah
the
older
man
eyes
narrowed
a
little
for
a
moment
there
existed
a
curious
wholly
indefinite
resembance
between
them
and
you
are
happy
he
asked
abruptly
everard
eyes
held
a
certain
hardness
as
he
replied
provisionally
yes
i
have
got
all
i
want
yet
if
that
what
you
mean
but
i
am
on
the
way
to
getting
it
bernard
monck
looked
at
him
a
moment
longer
and
let
him
go
are
you
sure
you
wanting
the
right
thing
he
said
it
was
not
a
question
that
demanded
an
answer
and
everard
made
none
he
turned
aside
with
a
scarcely
perceptible
lift
of
the
shoulders
you
have
told
me
yet
how
you
come
to
be
here
he
said
have
you
given
up
the
charthurst
chaplaincy
it
gave
me
up
bernard
spoke
quietly
but
there
was
deep
regret
in
his
voice
a
new
governor
came
a
man
of
curiously
rigid
ideas
anyway
i
was
not
parson
enough
for
him
we
could
assimilate
i
tried
my
hardest
but
we
could
get
into
touch
anywhere
i
preached
the
law
of
divine
liberty
to
the
captives
and
he
good
man
preferred
to
keep
them
safely
locked
in
the
dungeon
i
was
forced
to
quit
the
position
i
had
no
choice
what
a
fool
observed
everard
tersely
bernard
ready
smile
thanks
old
chap
he
said
just
the
point
of
view
i
wanted
you
to
take
now
i
have
other
schemes
on
hand
i
tell
you
later
what
they
are
i
think
i
better
have
that
cold
bath
next
if
you
really
going
to
take
me
along
to
mess
with
you
by
jove
how
it
does
rain
does
it
ever
leave
off
in
these
parts
not
very
often
this
time
of
the
year
i
not
going
to
let
you
stay
here
for
long
everard
spoke
with
his
customary
curt
decision
it
no
place
for
fellows
like
you
you
must
go
to
bhulwana
and
join
my
wife
many
thanks
bernard
made
a
grotesque
gesture
of
submission
what
sort
of
woman
is
your
wife
my
son
do
you
think
she
will
like
me
everard
turned
and
smote
him
on
the
shoulder
of
course
she
will
she
will
adore
you
all
women
do
oh
not
quite
protested
bernard
modestly
i
not
tall
enough
to
please
everyone
of
the
feminine
gender
but
you
think
your
wife
will
overlook
that
i
know
said
everard
with
conviction
his
brother
laughed
with
cheery
in
that
case
of
course
i
shall
adore
her
he
said
chapter
vii
false
pretences
they
were
a
merry
party
at
mess
that
night
general
sir
reginald
bassett
was
a
man
of
the
bluff
soldierly
order
who
knew
how
to
command
respect
from
his
inferiors
while
at
the
same
time
he
set
them
at
their
ease
there
was
no
pomp
and
circumstance
about
him
yet
in
the
whole
of
the
indian
empire
there
was
not
an
officer
more
highly
honoured
and
few
who
possessed
such
wide
influence
as
old
sir
reggie
as
irreverent
subalterns
fondly
called
him
the
new
arrival
bernard
monck
diffused
a
genial
atmosphere
quite
unconsciously
wherever
he
went
and
he
and
the
old
indian
soldier
gravitated
towards
each
other
almost
instinctively
colonel
mansfield
declared
later
that
they
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
maintain
order
so
spontaneous
and
so
infectious
was
the
gaiety
that
ran
round
the
board
even
major
ralston
leaden
sense
of
humour
was
stirred
as
tommy
had
declared
it
promised
to
be
a
historic
occasion
when
the
time
for
toasts
arrived
and
after
the
usual
routine
the
colonel
proposed
the
health
of
their
honoured
guest
of
the
evening
sir
reginald
interposed
with
a
courteous
request
that
that
of
their
other
guest
might
be
coupled
with
his
and
the
dual
toast
was
drunk
with
acclamations
i
hope
i
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
more
of
you
during
your
stay
in
india
the
general
remarked
to
his
when
he
had
returned
thanks
and
quiet
was
restored
you
have
come
for
the
winter
i
presume
bernard
laughed
well
no
sir
though
i
shall
hope
to
see
it
through
i
am
not
and
times
and
seasons
do
affect
me
much
my
only
reason
for
coming
out
at
all
was
to
see
my
brother
here
you
see
we
have
met
for
a
good
many
years
the
statement
was
quite
casually
made
but
major
burton
who
was
seated
next
to
him
made
a
sharp
movement
as
if
startled
he
was
a
man
who
prided
himself
upon
his
astuteness
in
discovering
discrepancies
in
even
the
most
truthful
stories
did
you
meet
last
year
when
he
went
home
he
said
last
year
no
he
was
home
last
year
bernard
looked
full
at
his
questioner
understanding
neither
his
tone
nor
look
a
sudden
silence
had
fallen
near
them
it
spread
like
a
widening
ring
upon
disturbed
waters
major
burton
spoke
in
his
voice
a
queer
scoffing
inflection
he
was
absent
on
home
leave
anyway
we
all
understood
were
given
to
understand
that
you
had
sent
him
an
urgent
summons
i
for
an
instant
bernard
monck
stared
in
genuine
bewilderment
then
abruptly
he
turned
to
his
brother
who
was
listening
inscrutably
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
some
mistake
here
everard
he
said
you
have
been
home
for
seven
years
or
more
have
you
there
was
dead
silence
in
the
room
as
he
put
the
question
a
silence
so
full
of
expectancy
as
to
be
almost
painful
across
the
table
the
eyes
of
the
two
brothers
met
and
held
then
i
have
not
said
everard
monck
with
quiet
finality
there
was
no
note
of
challenge
in
his
voice
neither
was
there
any
dismay
but
the
effect
of
his
words
upon
every
man
present
was
as
if
he
had
flung
a
bomb
into
their
midst
the
silence
endured
tensely
for
a
couple
of
seconds
then
there
came
a
hard
breath
and
a
general
movement
as
if
by
common
consent
the
company
desired
to
put
an
end
to
a
situation
that
had
become
unendurable
bertie
oakes
dug
tommy
in
the
ribs
but
tommy
was
as
white
as
death
and
did
not
even
feel
it
something
had
happened
something
that
made
him
feel
giddy
and
very
sick
that
significant
silence
was
to
him
nothing
short
of
tragedy
he
had
seen
his
hero
topple
at
a
touch
from
the
high
pinnacle
on
which
he
had
placed
him
and
he
felt
as
if
the
very
ground
under
his
feet
had
become
a
quicksand
as
in
a
maze
of
shifting
impressions
he
heard
sir
reginald
valiantly
covering
the
sudden
breach
talking
inconsequently
in
a
language
which
tommy
could
not
even
recognize
as
his
own
and
the
colonel
was
seconding
his
efforts
while
major
burton
sat
frowning
at
the
end
of
his
cigar
as
if
he
were
trying
to
focus
his
sight
upon
something
infinitesimal
and
elusive
no
one
looked
at
monck
in
fact
everyone
seemed
studiously
to
avoid
doing
so
even
his
brother
seemed
lost
in
meditation
with
his
eyes
fixed
immovably
upon
a
lamp
that
hung
from
the
ceiling
and
swayed
ponderously
in
the
draught
then
at
last
there
came
a
definite
move
and
bertie
oakes
poked
him
again
are
you
moonstruck
he
said
tommy
got
up
with
the
rest
still
feeling
sick
and
oddly
unsure
of
himself
he
pushed
his
aside
as
if
he
had
been
an
inanimate
object
and
somehow
groping
found
his
way
to
the
door
and
out
to
the
entrance
for
a
breath
of
air
it
was
raining
heavily
and
the
odour
of
a
thousand
intangible
things
hung
in
the
atmosphere
for
a
space
he
leaned
in
the
doorway
undisturbed
then
heralded
by
the
smell
of
a
rank
cigar
ralston
lounged
up
and
joined
him
are
you
looking
for
a
safe
corner
to
catch
fever
in
he
inquired
phlegmatically
after
a
pause
tommy
made
a
restless
movement
but
spoke
no
word
ralston
smoked
for
a
space
in
silence
from
behind
them
there
came
the
rattle
of
and
careless
clatter
of
voices
before
them
was
a
darkness
and
the
endless
patter
of
rain
suddenly
ralston
spoke
make
no
mistake
he
said
there
a
reason
for
everything
the
words
sounded
irrelevant
they
even
had
a
sententious
ring
yet
tommy
turned
towards
him
with
an
impulsive
gesture
of
gratitude
of
course
he
said
ralston
relapsed
into
a
ruminating
silence
a
full
minute
elapsed
before
he
spoke
again
then
you
do
like
taking
advice
i
know
he
said
in
his
stolid
somewhat
gruff
fashion
but
if
you
wise
you
swallow
a
stiff
dose
of
quinine
before
you
turn
in
he
swung
round
on
his
heel
and
walked
away
tommy
knew
that
he
had
gone
for
his
nightly
game
of
chess
with
major
burton
and
would
not
exchange
so
much
as
another
words
with
any
one
during
the
rest
of
the
evening
he
himself
remained
for
a
while
where
he
was
recovering
his
balance
then
at
length
donned
his
mackintosh
and
tramped
forth
into
the
night
ralston
was
right
doubtless
there
was
a
reason
he
would
stake
his
life
on
everard
honour
whatever
the
odds
in
a
quiet
corner
of
the
sat
everard
monck
deeply
immersed
in
a
paper
near
him
a
group
of
played
an
almost
silent
game
sir
reginald
and
his
brother
had
followed
the
youngsters
to
the
the
colonel
had
accompanied
them
but
after
a
decent
interval
he
left
the
guests
to
themselves
and
returned
to
the
he
passed
the
by
and
came
to
monck
the
latter
glanced
up
at
his
approach
are
you
looking
for
me
sir
if
you
can
spare
me
a
moment
i
shall
be
glad
the
colonel
said
formally
monck
rose
instantly
his
dark
face
had
a
look
as
he
followed
his
superior
officer
from
the
room
the
watched
him
with
furtive
attention
and
resumed
their
game
in
silence
the
colonel
led
the
way
back
to
the
now
deserted
i
shall
not
keep
you
long
he
said
as
monck
shut
the
door
and
moved
forward
but
i
must
ask
of
you
an
explanation
of
the
fact
which
came
to
light
this
evening
he
paused
a
moment
but
monck
spoke
no
word
and
he
continued
with
growing
coldness
rather
more
than
a
year
ago
you
refused
a
government
mission
for
which
your
services
were
urgently
required
on
the
plea
of
pressing
business
at
home
you
had
home
leave
at
a
time
when
we
were
to
carry
this
business
through
now
captain
monck
will
you
be
good
enough
to
tell
me
how
and
where
you
spent
that
leave
whatever
you
say
i
shall
treat
as
confidential
he
still
spoke
formally
but
the
usual
rather
pompous
kindliness
of
his
face
had
given
place
to
a
look
of
acute
anxiety
monck
stood
at
the
table
gazing
straight
before
him
you
have
a
perfect
right
to
ask
sir
he
said
after
a
moment
but
i
am
not
in
a
position
to
answer
in
other
words
you
refuse
to
answer
the
colonel
voice
had
a
rasp
in
it
but
that
also
held
more
of
anxiety
than
anger
monck
turned
and
directly
faced
him
i
am
compelled
to
refuse
he
said
there
was
a
brief
silence
colonel
mansfield
was
looking
at
him
as
if
he
would
read
him
through
and
through
but
no
stone
mask
could
have
been
more
impenetrable
than
monck
face
as
he
stood
stiffly
waiting
when
the
colonel
spoke
again
it
was
wholly
without
emotion
his
tones
fell
cold
and
measured
you
obtained
that
leave
upon
false
pretences
you
had
no
urgent
business
monck
answered
him
with
accuracy
yes
sir
i
deceived
you
but
my
business
was
urgent
nevertheless
that
is
my
only
excuse
was
it
in
connection
with
some
secret
service
requirement
the
colonel
tone
was
strictly
judicial
now
he
had
banished
all
feeling
from
face
and
manner
and
again
like
a
machine
monck
made
his
curt
reply
no
sir
there
was
nothing
official
about
it
nothing
i
am
to
conclude
then
again
the
rasp
was
in
the
colonel
voice
but
it
sounded
harsher
now
that
the
business
upon
which
you
absented
yourself
was
strictly
private
and
personal
it
was
sir
the
commanding
officer
brows
contracted
heavily
am
i
also
to
conclude
that
it
was
something
of
a
dishonourable
nature
he
asked
monck
made
a
scarcely
perceptible
movement
it
was
as
if
the
point
had
somehow
pierced
his
armour
but
he
covered
it
instantly
your
deductions
are
of
your
own
making
sir
he
said
i
see
the
colonel
tone
was
openly
harsh
you
are
ashamed
to
tell
me
the
truth
well
captain
monck
i
can
not
compel
you
to
do
so
but
it
would
have
been
better
for
your
own
sake
if
you
had
taken
up
a
less
reticent
attitude
of
course
i
realize
that
there
are
certain
shameful
occasions
regarding
which
any
man
must
keep
silence
but
i
had
not
thought
you
capable
of
having
a
secret
of
that
description
to
guard
i
think
it
very
doubtful
if
general
bassett
will
now
require
your
services
upon
his
staff
he
paused
monck
hands
were
clenched
and
rigid
but
he
spoke
no
word
and
gave
no
other
sign
of
emotion
you
have
nothing
to
say
to
me
the
colonel
asked
and
for
a
moment
the
official
air
was
gone
he
spoke
as
one
man
to
another
and
almost
with
entreaty
but
nothing
sir
said
monck
firmly
and
the
moment
passed
the
colonel
turned
aside
very
well
he
said
briefly
monck
swung
round
and
opened
the
door
for
him
standing
as
stiffly
as
a
soldier
on
parade
he
went
out
without
a
backward
glance
chapter
viii
the
wrath
of
the
gods
it
was
nearly
an
hour
later
that
everard
monck
and
his
brother
left
the
mess
together
and
walked
back
through
the
dripping
darkness
to
the
bungalow
on
the
hill
overlooking
the
river
the
rush
of
the
swollen
stream
became
audible
as
they
drew
near
the
sound
of
it
was
inexpressibly
wild
and
desolate
it
an
interesting
country
remarked
bernard
breaking
a
silence
i
do
wonder
she
has
got
hold
of
you
my
son
what
does
your
wife
think
of
it
is
she
too
caught
in
the
toils
not
by
word
or
look
had
he
made
the
smallest
reference
to
the
episode
at
the
it
was
as
if
he
alone
of
those
present
had
wholly
missed
its
significance
everard
answered
him
quietly
without
much
emphasis
i
believe
my
wife
hates
it
from
beginning
to
end
perhaps
it
is
not
surprising
she
has
been
through
a
good
deal
since
she
came
out
and
i
am
afraid
there
is
a
good
deal
before
her
still
bernard
big
hand
closed
upon
his
arm
poor
old
chap
lie
said
you
indian
fellows
do
have
any
such
time
of
it
or
your
women
folk
either
how
long
is
she
a
fixture
at
bhulwana
the
baby
is
expected
in
two
months
time
everard
spoke
without
emotion
his
voice
sounded
almost
cold
after
that
i
do
know
what
will
happen
nothing
is
settled
tell
me
your
plans
now
no
wait
get
in
out
of
this
damned
rain
first
they
entered
the
bungalow
and
sat
down
for
another
smoke
in
the
down
by
the
river
a
native
instrument
thrummed
monotonously
like
the
whirring
of
a
giant
mosquito
in
the
darkness
everard
turned
with
a
slight
gesture
of
impatience
and
closed
the
window
he
established
his
brother
in
a
long
chair
with
a
drink
at
his
elbow
and
sat
down
himself
without
any
pretence
at
taking
his
ease
you
do
look
particularly
comfortable
bernard
observed
do
mind
me
he
made
curt
response
i
got
a
touch
of
fever
it
nothing
i
shall
be
all
right
in
the
morning
sure
bernard
eyes
suddenly
ceased
to
be
quizzical
they
looked
at
him
straight
and
hard
everard
met
the
look
faintly
smiling
i
do
lie
about
unimportant
things
he
remarked
cynically
light
up
man
and
fire
away
he
struck
a
match
for
his
brother
pipe
and
kindled
his
own
cigarette
thereat
there
fell
a
brief
silence
bernard
did
not
look
wholly
satisfied
but
after
a
few
seconds
he
seemed
to
dismiss
the
matter
and
began
to
talk
of
himself
you
want
to
know
my
plans
old
chap
well
as
far
as
i
know
myself
you
are
quite
welcome
with
your
permission
i
propose
for
the
present
to
stay
where
i
am
i
should
if
i
were
you
everard
spoke
with
brief
decision
be
far
better
off
at
bhulwana
till
the
end
of
the
rains
bernard
puffed
forth
a
great
cloud
of
smoke
and
stared
at
the
ceiling
that
is
as
may
be
dear
fellow
he
said
after
a
moment
but
i
think
if
you
put
up
with
me
i
stay
here
for
the
present
all
the
same
he
spoke
in
that
peculiarly
gentle
voice
of
his
that
yet
held
considerable
resolution
everard
made
no
attempt
to
combat
the
decision
perhaps
he
realized
the
uselessness
of
such
a
proceeding
stay
by
all
means
he
said
but
what
the
idea
bernard
took
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
i
have
a
big
fight
before
me
everard
boy
he
said
a
fight
against
the
sort
of
prejudice
that
kicked
me
out
of
the
charthurst
job
it
got
to
be
fought
with
the
pen
since
i
am
no
street
corner
ranter
i
have
the
solid
outlines
of
the
campaign
in
my
head
and
i
have
come
out
here
to
get
right
away
from
things
and
work
it
out
going
to
reform
creation
suggested
everard
with
his
grim
smile
bernard
shook
his
head
smiling
in
answer
as
though
the
cynicism
had
not
reached
him
no
that
not
my
job
i
am
only
a
man
under
authority
like
yourself
i
do
see
the
result
at
all
i
only
see
the
work
and
with
god
help
that
will
be
exactly
what
he
intended
it
should
be
when
he
gave
it
to
me
to
do
lucky
man
said
everard
briefly
ah
i
did
think
myself
lucky
when
i
had
to
give
up
the
charthurst
chaplaincy
bernard
spoke
through
a
haze
of
smoke
i
afraid
i
kicked
a
bit
at
first
which
was
a
thing
to
do
i
admit
but
i
had
got
to
look
on
it
as
my
and
i
loved
it
it
held
such
opportunities
he
broke
off
with
a
sharp
sigh
i
shall
be
at
it
again
if
i
go
on
ca
you
give
me
something
pleasanter
to
think
about
have
you
got
a
photograph
of
your
wife
to
show
me
everard
got
up
yes
i
have
but
it
does
do
her
justice
he
took
a
from
his
pocket
and
opened
it
a
moment
he
stood
bent
over
the
portrait
he
withdrew
from
it
then
turned
and
handed
it
to
his
brother
bernard
studied
it
in
silence
it
was
an
unmounted
amateur
photograph
of
stella
standing
on
the
verandah
of
the
green
bungalow
she
was
smiling
but
her
eyes
were
faintly
sad
as
though
shadowed
by
the
memory
of
some
past
pain
for
many
seconds
bernard
gazed
upon
the
pictured
face
finally
he
spoke
your
wife
must
be
a
very
beautiful
woman
yes
said
everard
quietly
he
spoke
gravely
his
brother
eyes
travelled
upwards
swiftly
that
was
not
what
you
married
her
for
eh
everard
stooped
and
took
the
portrait
from
him
well
no
not
entirely
he
said
bernard
smiled
a
little
you
have
told
me
much
about
her
you
know
how
long
have
you
been
acquainted
nearly
two
years
i
think
i
mentioned
in
my
letter
that
she
was
the
widow
of
a
comrade
yes
i
remember
but
you
were
rather
vague
about
it
what
happened
to
him
did
he
meet
with
a
violent
death
there
was
a
pause
everard
was
still
standing
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
photograph
his
face
was
stern
what
was
it
questioned
bernard
did
he
fall
over
a
precipice
yes
abruptly
the
younger
man
made
answer
it
happened
in
kashmir
when
they
were
on
their
honeymoon
ah
poor
girl
she
must
have
suffered
what
was
his
name
was
he
a
pal
of
yours
more
or
less
everard
voice
rang
hard
his
name
was
dacre
oh
to
be
sure
the
man
i
wrote
to
you
about
just
before
poor
madelina
belleville
died
in
prison
her
husband
name
was
dacre
he
was
in
the
army
too
and
she
thought
he
was
in
india
but
it
not
a
very
uncommon
name
bernard
spoke
thoughtfully
you
said
he
was
no
relation
i
said
to
the
best
of
my
belief
he
was
not
everard
turned
suddenly
and
sat
down
people
are
not
keen
you
know
on
owning
to
shady
relations
he
was
no
exception
to
the
rule
but
if
the
woman
died
of
no
great
consequence
now
to
any
one
when
did
she
die
bernard
took
a
long
pull
at
his
pipe
his
brows
were
slightly
drawn
she
died
suddenly
poor
soul
did
i
never
tell
you
it
must
have
been
immediately
after
i
wrote
that
letter
to
you
it
was
i
remember
now
it
was
the
very
day
after
she
died
on
the
of
march
the
first
day
of
spring
poor
girl
she
had
so
longed
for
the
spring
her
time
would
have
been
up
in
may
something
in
the
silence
that
followed
his
words
made
him
turn
his
head
to
look
at
his
brother
everard
was
sitting
perfectly
rigid
in
his
chair
staring
at
the
ground
between
his
feet
as
if
he
saw
a
serpent
writhing
there
but
before
another
word
could
be
spoken
he
got
up
abruptly
with
a
gesture
as
of
shaking
off
the
loathsome
thing
and
went
to
the
window
he
flung
it
wide
and
stood
in
the
opening
breathing
hard
as
a
man
anything
wrong
old
chap
questioned
bernard
he
answered
him
without
turning
no
it
only
my
infernal
head
i
think
i
turn
in
directly
it
a
fiendish
night
the
rain
was
falling
in
torrents
and
a
long
roll
of
thunder
sounded
from
afar
the
clatter
of
the
great
drops
on
the
roof
of
the
verandah
filled
the
room
making
all
further
conversation
impossible
it
was
like
a
tattoo
of
devils
a
damn
pleasant
country
this
murmured
the
man
in
the
chair
the
man
at
the
window
said
no
word
he
was
gasping
a
little
his
face
to
the
howling
night
for
a
space
bernard
lay
and
watched
him
then
at
last
somewhat
ponderously
he
arose
everard
could
not
have
heard
his
approach
but
he
was
aware
of
it
before
he
reached
him
he
turned
swiftly
round
pulling
the
window
closed
behind
him
they
stood
facing
each
other
and
there
was
something
tense
in
the
atmosphere
something
that
was
oddly
suggestive
of
mental
conflict
the
devils
tattoo
on
the
roof
had
sunk
to
a
mere
undersong
a
fitting
accompaniment
as
it
were
to
the
electricity
in
the
room
bernard
spoke
at
length
slowly
deliberately
but
not
unkindly
why
should
you
take
the
trouble
to
fence
with
me
he
said
is
it
worth
it
do
you
think
everard
face
was
set
and
grey
like
a
stone
mask
he
did
not
speak
for
a
moment
then
curtly
noncommittally
what
do
you
mean
he
said
i
mean
very
steadily
bernard
made
reply
that
the
scoundrel
dacre
who
married
madelina
belleville
and
then
deserted
her
left
her
to
go
to
the
dogs
and
your
who
was
killed
in
the
mountains
on
his
honeymoon
were
one
and
the
same
man
and
you
knew
it
well
the
words
seemed
to
come
from
closed
lips
there
was
something
terrible
in
the
utter
quietness
of
its
utterance
bernard
searched
his
face
as
a
man
might
search
the
walls
of
an
apparently
impregnable
fortress
for
some
vulnerable
spot
ah
i
see
he
said
after
a
moment
you
must
have
believed
madelina
to
be
still
alive
when
dacre
married
what
was
the
date
of
his
marriage
the
of
march
again
the
grim
lips
spoke
without
seeming
to
move
a
gleam
of
relief
crossed
his
brother
face
in
that
case
no
one
is
any
the
worse
i
sorry
you
carried
that
bugbear
about
with
you
for
so
long
what
an
infernal
hound
the
fellow
was
yes
assented
everard
he
moved
to
the
table
and
poured
himself
out
a
drink
his
brother
still
watched
him
one
might
almost
say
his
death
was
providential
he
observed
of
course
your
wife
never
knew
of
this
no
everard
lifted
the
glass
to
his
lips
with
a
perfectly
steady
hand
and
drank
she
never
will
know
he
said
as
he
set
it
down
certainly
not
you
can
trust
me
never
to
tell
her
bernard
moved
to
his
side
and
laid
a
kindly
hand
on
his
shoulder
you
know
you
can
trust
me
old
fellow
everard
did
not
look
at
him
yes
i
know
he
said
his
brother
hand
pressed
upon
him
a
little
since
they
are
both
gone
he
said
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
said
on
the
subject
but
oh
man
stick
to
the
truth
whatever
else
you
let
go
of
you
never
lied
to
me
before
his
tone
was
very
earnest
it
held
urgent
entreaty
everard
turned
and
met
his
eyes
his
dark
face
was
wholly
emotionless
i
am
sorry
bernard
he
said
bernard
kindly
smile
wrinkled
his
eyes
he
grasped
and
held
the
younger
man
hand
all
right
boy
i
going
to
forget
it
he
said
now
what
about
turning
in
they
parted
for
the
night
immediately
after
the
one
to
sleep
as
serenely
as
a
child
almost
as
soon
as
he
lay
down
the
other
to
pace
to
and
fro
to
and
fro
for
hours
grappling
and
grappling
in
vain
with
the
sternest
adversary
he
had
ever
had
to
encounter
for
upon
everard
monck
that
night
the
wrath
of
the
gods
had
descended
and
against
it
even
his
grim
fortitude
was
powerless
to
make
a
stand
he
was
beaten
before
he
could
begin
to
defend
himself
beaten
and
flung
aside
as
contemptible
only
one
thing
remained
to
be
fought
for
and
that
one
thing
he
swore
to
guard
with
the
last
ounce
of
his
strength
even
at
the
cost
of
life
itself
all
through
that
night
of
bitter
turmoil
he
came
back
again
and
again
to
that
the
only
solid
foothold
left
him
in
the
shifting
so
long
as
his
heart
should
beat
he
would
defend
that
one
precious
possession
that
yet
remained
the
honour
of
the
woman
who
loved
him
and
whom
he
loved
as
only
the
few
know
how
to
love
part
iv
chapter
i
devils
dice
it
a
pity
said
sir
reginald
it
a
damnable
pity
sir
colonel
mansfield
spoke
with
blunt
emphasis
i
have
trusted
the
fellow
almost
as
i
would
have
trusted
myself
and
he
has
let
me
down
the
two
were
old
friends
the
tie
of
india
bound
them
both
though
their
ways
lay
apart
and
they
met
but
seldom
the
same
spirit
was
in
them
and
they
were
as
comrades
they
sat
together
in
the
colonel
office
that
looked
over
the
streaming
a
gleam
of
morning
sunshine
had
pierced
the
clouds
and
the
smoke
of
the
plains
went
up
like
a
furnace
i
should
be
too
sure
of
that
said
sir
reginald
after
a
thoughtful
moment
things
are
not
always
what
they
seem
one
is
apt
to
repent
of
a
hasty
judgment
i
know
the
colonel
spoke
with
his
eyes
upon
the
rising
cloud
of
steam
outside
but
this
fellow
has
always
had
my
confidence
and
i
ca
get
over
what
he
himself
admits
to
have
been
a
piece
of
i
suppose
it
was
a
sudden
temptation
but
he
had
always
been
so
straight
with
me
at
least
i
had
always
imagined
him
so
he
has
rendered
some
invaluable
services
too
that
is
partly
why
i
say
do
be
too
hasty
said
sir
reginald
we
ca
afford
india
ca
afford
to
scrap
a
single
really
useful
man
neither
can
she
afford
to
make
use
of
rotters
rejoined
the
colonel
sir
reginald
smiled
a
little
i
am
not
so
sure
of
that
mansfield
even
the
rotters
have
their
uses
but
i
am
quite
convinced
in
my
own
mind
that
this
man
is
very
far
from
being
one
i
feel
inclined
to
go
slow
for
a
time
and
give
him
a
chance
to
retrieve
himself
perhaps
it
may
sound
soft
to
you
but
i
have
never
floored
a
man
at
his
first
slip
and
this
man
has
a
clean
record
behind
him
let
it
stand
him
in
good
stead
now
it
will
take
me
some
time
to
forget
it
the
colonel
said
i
can
forgive
almost
anything
except
deception
and
that
i
loathe
it
is
pleasant
to
be
cheated
certainly
sir
reginald
agreed
when
did
this
happen
was
he
married
at
the
time
no
the
colonel
meditated
for
a
few
seconds
he
only
married
last
spring
this
was
considerably
more
than
a
year
ago
it
must
have
been
the
spring
of
the
preceding
year
yes
by
jove
it
was
it
was
just
at
the
time
of
poor
dacre
marriage
dacre
you
know
married
young
denvers
sister
the
girl
who
is
now
monck
wife
dacre
was
killed
on
his
honeymoon
only
a
fortnight
after
the
wedding
you
remember
that
burton
he
turned
abruptly
to
the
major
who
had
entered
while
he
was
speaking
burton
came
to
a
stand
at
the
table
his
eyes
were
set
very
close
together
and
they
glittered
meanly
as
he
made
reply
i
remember
it
very
well
indeed
his
death
coincided
with
this
mysterious
leave
of
monck
and
also
with
the
unexpected
absence
of
our
man
rustam
karin
just
at
a
moment
when
barnes
particularly
needed
him
who
is
rustam
karin
asked
sir
reginald
a
police
agent
a
clever
man
i
may
say
an
invaluable
man
colonel
mansfield
was
looking
hard
at
the
major
face
as
he
made
reply
no
one
likes
the
fellow
he
is
suspected
of
being
a
leper
but
he
is
clever
he
is
undoubtedly
clever
i
remember
his
absence
it
was
at
the
time
of
that
mission
to
khanmulla
the
mission
i
wanted
monck
to
take
in
hand
exactly
major
burton
rapped
out
the
word
with
a
sound
like
the
cracking
of
a
nut
we
or
rather
barnes
tried
to
pump
hafiz
about
it
but
he
was
a
mass
of
ignorance
and
lies
i
believe
the
old
brute
turned
up
again
before
monck
return
but
he
was
visible
till
afterwards
he
and
monck
have
always
been
thick
as
thieves
thick
as
thieves
he
paused
looking
at
sir
reginald
a
very
fishy
transaction
sir
he
observed
sir
reginald
eyes
met
his
are
you
he
said
calmly
trying
to
establish
any
connection
between
the
death
of
dacre
and
the
absence
from
kurrumpore
of
this
man
rustam
karin
not
only
rustam
karin
sir
responded
the
major
sharply
ah
quite
so
how
did
dacre
die
sir
reginald
still
spoke
quietly
judicially
there
was
nothing
encouraging
in
his
aspect
burton
hesitated
momentarily
as
if
some
inner
warning
prompted
him
to
go
warily
that
was
what
no
one
knew
for
certain
sir
he
disappeared
one
night
the
story
went
that
he
fell
over
a
precipice
some
old
native
beggar
told
the
tale
no
one
knows
who
the
man
was
but
you
have
your
eye
upon
rustam
karin
suggested
sir
reginald
burton
hesitated
again
one
does
trust
these
fellows
sir
he
said
true
sir
reginald
voice
sounded
very
dry
perhaps
it
is
a
mistake
to
trust
any
one
too
far
this
is
all
the
evidence
you
can
muster
yes
sir
burton
looked
suddenly
embarrassed
of
course
it
is
not
evidence
strictly
speaking
he
said
but
when
mysteries
coincide
one
is
apt
to
link
them
together
and
the
death
of
captain
dacre
always
seemed
to
me
highly
mysterious
the
death
of
captain
ermsted
was
no
less
so
put
in
the
colonel
abruptly
have
you
any
theories
on
that
subject
also
burton
smiled
showing
his
teeth
i
always
have
theories
he
said
sir
reginald
made
a
slight
movement
of
impatience
i
think
this
is
beside
the
point
he
said
captain
ermsted
murderer
will
probably
be
traced
one
day
probably
sir
agreed
major
burton
since
i
hear
unofficially
that
captain
monck
has
the
matter
in
hand
ah
he
broke
off
short
as
with
a
brief
knock
at
the
door
monck
himself
made
an
abrupt
appearance
he
came
forward
as
if
he
saw
no
one
in
the
room
but
the
colonel
his
face
wore
a
curiously
stony
look
but
his
eyes
burned
with
a
fierce
intensity
he
spoke
without
apology
or
preliminary
of
any
sort
i
have
just
had
a
message
sir
from
bhulwana
he
said
i
wish
to
apply
for
immediate
leave
the
colonel
looked
at
him
in
surprise
a
message
captain
monck
from
my
wife
monck
said
and
drew
a
hard
breath
between
his
teeth
his
hands
were
clenched
hard
at
his
sides
i
got
to
go
he
said
i
got
to
go
there
was
a
moment
silence
then
may
i
see
the
message
said
the
colonel
monck
eyelids
flickered
sharply
as
if
he
had
been
struck
across
the
face
he
thrust
out
his
right
hand
and
flung
a
crumpled
paper
upon
the
table
there
sir
he
said
harshly
there
was
violence
in
the
action
but
it
did
not
hold
insolence
sir
reginald
leaning
forward
was
watching
him
intently
as
the
colonel
with
a
word
of
excuse
to
himself
took
up
and
opened
the
paper
he
rose
quietly
and
went
up
to
monck
thin
wiry
grizzled
he
stopped
beside
him
major
burton
retired
behind
the
colonel
realizing
himself
as
unnecessary
but
too
curious
to
withdraw
altogether
in
the
pause
that
followed
a
tense
silence
reigned
monck
was
swaying
as
he
stood
his
eyes
had
the
strained
and
awful
look
of
a
man
with
his
soul
in
torment
after
that
one
hard
breath
he
had
not
breathed
at
all
the
colonel
looked
up
go
certainly
he
said
and
there
was
a
touch
of
the
old
kindliness
in
his
voice
that
he
tried
to
restrain
and
as
soon
as
possible
i
hope
you
will
find
a
more
reassuring
state
of
affairs
when
you
get
there
he
held
out
the
telegram
monck
made
a
movement
to
take
it
but
as
he
did
so
the
tension
in
which
he
gripped
himself
suddenly
gave
way
he
blundered
forward
his
hands
upon
the
table
she
will
die
he
said
and
there
was
utter
despair
in
his
tone
she
is
probably
dead
already
sir
reginald
took
him
by
the
arm
his
face
held
nought
but
kindliness
which
he
made
no
attempt
to
hide
sit
down
a
minute
he
said
a
chair
just
a
minute
sit
down
and
get
your
wind
what
is
this
message
may
i
read
it
he
murmured
something
to
major
burton
who
turned
sharply
and
went
out
monck
sank
heavily
into
the
chair
and
leaned
upon
the
table
his
head
in
his
hands
he
was
shaking
all
over
as
if
seized
with
an
ague
sir
reginald
read
the
message
standing
beside
him
a
hand
upon
his
shoulder
stella
desperately
come
ralston
were
the
words
it
contained
he
laid
the
paper
upon
the
table
and
looked
across
at
the
colonel
the
latter
nodded
slightly
almost
imperceptibly
monck
spoke
without
moving
she
is
dead
he
said
my
god
she
is
dead
and
then
under
his
breath
after
all
counting
me
out
best
it
best
i
could
ask
for
anything
better
at
this
game
someone
got
to
die
he
checked
himself
abruptly
and
again
a
terrible
shivering
seized
him
sir
reginald
bent
over
him
pull
yourself
together
man
you
need
all
your
strength
please
god
she
be
better
when
you
get
there
monck
raised
himself
with
a
slow
blind
movement
did
you
ever
dice
with
the
devil
he
said
stake
your
honour
stake
all
you
got
to
save
a
woman
from
hell
and
then
lose
my
god
lose
all
even
even
the
woman
again
he
checked
himself
i
talking
like
a
damned
fool
stop
me
someone
i
come
through
and
it
scorched
away
my
senses
i
never
thought
i
should
blab
like
this
it
all
right
sir
reginald
said
and
in
his
voice
was
steady
reassurance
you
with
friends
get
a
hold
on
yourself
do
say
any
more
ah
monck
drew
a
deep
breath
and
seemed
to
come
to
himself
he
lifted
a
face
of
appalling
whiteness
and
looked
at
sir
reginald
you
very
good
sir
he
said
i
was
knocked
out
for
the
moment
i
all
right
now
he
made
as
if
he
would
rise
but
sir
reginald
checked
him
wait
a
moment
longer
major
burton
will
be
back
directly
major
burton
questioned
monck
i
sent
him
for
some
brandy
to
steady
your
nerves
sir
reginald
said
you
very
good
monck
said
again
he
leaned
his
head
on
his
hand
and
sat
silent
major
burton
returned
with
tommy
hovering
anxiously
behind
him
the
boy
hesitated
a
little
upon
entering
but
the
colonel
called
him
in
you
had
better
see
the
message
too
he
said
your
sister
is
captain
monck
is
going
to
her
tommy
read
the
message
with
one
eye
upon
monck
who
drank
the
brandy
burton
brought
and
in
a
moment
stood
up
i
am
sorry
to
have
made
such
a
fool
of
myself
sir
he
said
to
sir
reginald
with
a
faint
grim
smile
i
shall
not
forget
your
kindness
though
i
hope
you
will
forget
my
idiocy
sir
reginald
looked
at
him
closely
for
a
second
his
grizzled
face
was
stern
yet
he
held
out
his
hand
captain
monck
was
all
he
said
monck
stiffened
the
smile
passed
from
his
face
leaving
it
inscrutable
in
its
composure
it
was
as
the
donning
of
a
mask
sir
he
said
briefly
as
he
shook
hands
tommy
moved
to
his
side
impulsively
he
did
not
utter
a
word
but
as
they
went
out
his
hand
was
pushed
through
monck
arm
in
the
old
confidential
fashion
the
old
eager
affection
was
shining
in
his
eyes
he
has
one
staunch
friend
anyhow
sir
reginald
muttered
to
the
colonel
yes
the
colonel
answered
gravely
he
has
done
a
good
deal
for
young
denvers
it
the
boy
turn
to
make
good
now
there
is
much
left
him
besides
poor
devil
said
sir
reginald
chapter
ii
out
of
the
darkness
you
said
everard
was
coming
why
does
he
come
it
very
dark
very
dark
can
he
have
missed
the
way
feebly
haltingly
the
words
seemed
to
wander
through
the
room
breaking
a
great
silence
as
it
were
with
immense
effort
ralston
bent
over
the
bed
and
whispered
hushingly
that
it
was
all
right
all
right
everard
would
be
there
soon
but
why
does
he
take
so
long
murmured
stella
it
getting
darker
every
minute
and
it
so
steep
i
keep
slipping
slipping
i
know
he
would
hold
me
up
and
then
after
a
moment
oh
mary
am
i
dying
i
believe
i
am
but
he
would
let
me
die
ralston
hand
closed
comfortingly
upon
hers
you
quite
safe
dearest
she
said
do
be
afraid
but
it
so
dreadfully
dark
stella
said
restlessly
i
should
mind
if
i
could
see
the
way
but
i
ca
i
ca
be
patient
darling
said
ralston
very
tenderly
it
will
be
lighter
presently
it
was
growing
very
late
she
herself
was
listening
for
every
sound
hoping
against
hope
to
hear
the
firm
quiet
step
of
the
man
who
alone
could
still
her
charge
growing
distress
it
would
be
so
dreadful
to
miss
him
moaned
stella
i
have
waited
so
long
mary
why
do
they
light
a
lamp
a
shaded
lamp
was
burning
on
the
table
by
the
bed
ralston
turned
and
lifted
the
shade
but
stella
shook
her
head
with
a
weary
discontent
that
does
help
it
in
the
desert
that
i
mean
so
that
he
miss
me
when
he
comes
he
can
not
miss
you
darling
ralston
assured
her
but
in
her
own
heart
she
doubted
for
the
doctor
had
told
her
that
he
did
not
think
she
would
live
through
the
night
again
she
strained
her
ears
to
listen
she
had
certainly
heard
a
sound
outside
the
door
but
it
might
be
only
peter
who
she
knew
crouched
there
alert
for
any
service
it
was
peter
but
it
was
not
peter
only
for
even
as
she
listened
the
handle
of
the
door
turned
softly
and
someone
entered
she
looked
up
eagerly
and
saw
the
doctor
he
was
a
thin
grey
man
for
whom
she
entertained
privately
a
certain
feeling
of
contempt
she
was
so
sure
her
own
husband
would
have
somehow
managed
the
case
better
he
came
to
the
bedside
and
looked
at
stella
looked
closely
then
turned
to
her
friend
watching
beside
her
i
wonder
if
it
would
disturb
her
to
see
her
husband
for
a
moment
he
said
ralston
suppressed
a
start
with
difficulty
is
he
here
she
whispered
just
arrived
he
murmured
back
and
turned
again
to
look
at
stella
who
lay
motionless
with
closed
eyes
scarcely
seeming
to
breathe
ralston
whisper
smote
the
silence
and
it
was
the
doctor
turn
to
start
send
him
in
at
once
she
said
so
insistent
was
her
command
that
he
stood
up
as
if
he
had
been
prodded
into
action
ralston
was
on
her
feet
she
waved
an
urgent
hand
go
and
get
him
she
ordered
almost
fiercely
it
the
only
chance
left
go
and
fetch
him
he
looked
at
her
doubtfully
for
a
second
then
impelled
by
an
authority
that
overrode
every
scruple
he
turned
in
silence
and
tiptoed
from
the
room
ralston
eyes
followed
him
with
scorn
how
was
it
some
doctors
managed
notwithstanding
all
their
experience
to
be
such
hopeless
idiots
the
soft
opening
of
the
door
again
a
few
seconds
later
banished
her
irritation
she
turned
with
shining
welcome
in
her
look
and
met
monck
with
outstretched
hands
you
in
time
she
said
he
gripped
her
hands
hard
but
he
scarcely
looked
at
her
in
a
moment
he
was
bending
over
the
bed
stella
girl
stella
he
said
everard
the
weak
voice
thrilled
like
a
loosened
and
the
man
dark
face
flashed
into
sudden
passionate
tenderness
he
went
down
upon
his
knees
beside
the
bed
and
gathered
her
to
his
breast
she
clung
to
him
feebly
her
lips
turned
to
his
my
darling
oh
my
darling
have
you
come
at
last
she
whispered
hold
me
hold
me
do
let
me
die
he
held
her
closer
and
closer
to
his
heart
so
that
its
fierce
throbbing
beat
against
her
own
you
sha
die
he
said
you
ca
die
with
me
here
she
laughed
a
little
sobbingly
you
saved
tommy
twice
over
i
knew
you
would
save
me
if
you
came
in
time
oh
darling
how
i
have
wanted
you
it
been
so
dark
and
terrible
but
you
held
on
monck
voice
was
very
low
it
came
with
a
manifest
effort
he
was
holding
her
to
his
breast
as
if
he
could
never
let
her
go
yes
i
held
on
i
knew
i
knew
how
how
it
would
hurt
you
to
find
me
gone
her
trembling
hands
moved
fondly
about
his
head
and
finally
clasped
his
neck
it
all
right
now
she
said
with
a
sigh
of
deep
content
monck
lips
pressed
hers
again
and
again
and
ralston
went
away
to
the
window
to
hide
her
tears
please
god
do
separate
them
now
she
whispered
it
was
many
minutes
later
that
stella
spoke
again
softly
into
ear
everard
darling
husband
the
baby
our
baby
do
you
you
like
to
see
it
the
baby
he
spoke
as
if
startled
somehow
he
had
concluded
from
the
first
that
the
baby
would
be
dead
and
the
rapture
of
finding
her
still
living
had
driven
the
thought
of
everything
else
from
his
mind
do
move
whispered
stella
clasping
him
closer
ask
them
to
bring
it
he
spoke
over
his
shoulder
to
ralston
his
voice
oddly
cold
almost
reluctant
would
you
be
good
enough
to
bring
the
baby
in
she
turned
at
once
smiling
upon
him
shakily
but
his
dark
face
remained
wholly
inscrutable
wholly
unresponsive
there
was
something
about
him
that
smote
her
with
a
curious
chill
but
she
told
herself
that
he
was
worn
out
with
hard
travel
and
anxiety
as
she
went
from
the
room
to
comply
with
his
curt
request
lying
against
his
shoulder
stella
whispered
a
few
halting
sentences
it
happened
so
suddenly
the
rajah
drives
so
fiercely
like
a
man
possessed
and
the
car
skidded
on
the
hill
netta
ermsted
was
in
it
and
she
screamed
and
i
i
was
terrified
because
tessa
tessa
brave
mite
sprang
in
front
of
me
i
do
know
what
she
thought
she
could
do
i
think
partly
she
was
angry
and
lost
her
head
and
she
meant
to
help
to
protect
me
somehow
after
that
i
fainted
and
when
i
came
round
they
had
brought
me
back
here
that
was
ever
so
long
ago
she
shuddered
convulsively
i
been
through
a
lot
since
then
monck
teeth
closed
upon
his
lip
he
had
not
suspected
an
accident
tremulously
stella
went
on
it
was
so
much
too
soon
i
was
dreadfully
afraid
for
the
poor
wee
baby
but
the
doctor
said
the
doctor
said
it
was
all
right
only
small
and
oh
everard
her
voice
thrilled
again
with
a
quivering
joy
it
is
a
boy
i
so
wanted
a
son
for
you
god
bless
you
he
said
almost
inarticulately
and
kissed
her
white
face
again
burningly
even
with
violence
she
smiled
at
his
intensity
though
it
made
her
gasp
i
know
i
know
you
will
be
great
she
said
and
your
son
must
carry
on
your
greatness
he
shall
learn
to
love
the
empire
as
you
do
we
will
teach
him
together
you
and
i
ah
monck
said
and
drew
the
hard
breath
of
a
man
struggling
in
deep
waters
ralston
returned
softly
with
a
white
bundle
in
her
arms
and
stella
hold
relaxed
her
heavy
lids
brightened
eagerly
my
dear
ralston
said
the
doctor
has
commanded
me
to
turn
your
husband
out
immediately
he
must
just
peep
at
the
darling
baby
and
go
tell
him
to
go
himself
to
blazes
said
monck
forcibly
and
then
reached
up
still
curiously
grim
to
ralston
observing
eyes
and
without
rising
from
his
knees
took
his
child
into
his
arms
he
laid
it
against
the
mother
breast
and
tenderly
uncovered
the
tiny
sleeping
face
oh
everard
she
said
and
ralston
turned
away
with
a
little
sob
she
did
not
believe
any
longer
that
stella
would
die
the
sweet
thrilling
happiness
of
her
voice
seemed
somehow
to
drive
out
the
very
thought
of
death
she
had
never
in
her
life
seen
any
one
so
supremely
happy
but
yet
though
she
was
reassured
there
was
something
else
in
the
atmosphere
that
disturbed
her
she
could
not
have
said
wherefore
but
she
was
sorry
for
monck
deeply
poignantly
sorry
she
was
certain
with
that
inner
conviction
that
needs
no
outer
evidence
that
it
was
more
than
weariness
and
the
strain
of
anxiety
that
had
drawn
those
deep
lines
about
his
eyes
and
mouth
he
looked
to
her
like
a
man
who
had
been
smitten
down
in
the
pride
of
his
strength
and
who
knew
his
case
to
be
hopeless
as
for
monck
he
went
through
his
ordeal
unflinching
suffering
as
few
men
are
called
upon
to
suffer
and
hiding
it
away
without
a
quiver
all
through
the
hours
of
his
journeying
he
had
been
prepared
to
face
he
had
actually
expected
the
worst
all
through
those
hours
he
had
battled
to
reach
her
indeed
straining
every
faculty
resisting
with
almost
superhuman
strength
every
obstacle
that
arose
to
bar
his
progress
but
he
had
not
thought
to
find
her
and
throughout
the
effort
he
had
carried
in
his
locked
heart
the
knowledge
that
if
when
he
came
at
last
to
her
bedside
he
found
her
this
woman
whom
he
loved
with
all
the
force
of
his
silent
soul
white
and
cold
in
death
it
would
be
the
best
fate
that
he
could
wish
her
the
best
thing
that
could
possibly
happen
so
far
as
mortal
sight
could
judge
for
either
but
so
it
had
not
been
at
the
very
gate
of
death
she
had
waited
for
his
coming
and
now
he
knew
in
his
heart
that
she
would
return
the
love
between
them
was
drawing
her
and
the
man
heart
in
him
battled
fiercely
to
rejoice
even
while
wrung
with
the
anguish
of
that
secret
knowledge
he
hardly
knew
how
he
went
through
those
moments
which
to
her
were
such
pure
ecstasy
the
blood
was
beating
wildly
in
his
brain
and
he
thought
of
that
devils
tattoo
on
the
roof
at
udalkhand
when
first
that
dreadful
knowledge
had
sprung
upon
him
like
an
evil
thing
out
of
the
night
but
he
held
himself
in
an
iron
grip
he
forced
his
mind
to
clearness
even
to
himself
he
would
not
seem
to
be
aware
of
the
agony
that
tore
him
they
whispered
together
for
a
while
over
the
baby
head
but
he
never
remembered
afterwards
what
passed
or
how
long
he
knelt
there
only
at
last
there
came
a
silence
that
drifted
on
and
on
and
he
knew
that
stella
was
asleep
later
ralston
stooped
over
him
and
took
the
baby
away
and
he
laid
his
head
down
upon
the
pillow
by
stella
and
wished
with
all
his
soul
that
the
gate
before
which
her
feet
had
halted
would
open
to
them
both
someone
came
up
behind
them
and
stood
for
a
few
seconds
looking
down
upon
them
he
was
aware
of
a
presence
but
he
knelt
on
without
stirring
as
one
kneeling
entranced
in
a
sacred
place
then
two
hands
he
knew
grasped
him
firmly
by
the
shoulders
raising
him
he
looked
up
into
his
brother
face
come
along
old
chap
bernard
whispered
you
must
faint
in
here
the
words
roused
him
the
old
sardonic
smile
showed
for
a
moment
about
his
lips
he
faint
but
he
had
not
slept
for
two
nights
that
would
account
for
that
curious
feeling
that
possessed
him
he
suffered
bernard
to
help
him
up
good
old
bernard
who
had
watched
over
him
like
a
mother
refusing
flatly
to
remain
behind
waiting
upon
him
hand
and
foot
at
every
turn
you
come
into
the
next
room
he
whispered
you
shall
be
called
immediately
if
she
wakes
and
wants
you
but
you
crumple
up
if
you
do
rest
there
was
truth
in
the
words
everard
realized
it
as
he
went
from
the
room
leaning
blindly
upon
the
stout
supporting
arm
his
weariness
hung
upon
him
like
an
overwhelming
weight
he
submitted
himself
almost
mechanically
to
his
brother
ordering
feeling
as
if
he
moved
in
a
dream
as
in
a
dream
also
he
saw
peter
at
the
door
move
noiseless
as
a
shadow
to
assist
him
on
the
other
side
and
he
tried
to
laugh
off
his
weakness
but
the
laugh
stuck
in
his
throat
then
he
found
himself
in
a
chair
drinking
a
stiff
mixture
of
brandy
and
water
again
at
bernard
behest
while
bernard
stood
over
him
watching
with
the
utmost
kindness
in
his
blue
eyes
the
spirit
steadied
him
he
came
to
himself
sat
up
slowly
and
motioned
peter
from
the
room
he
was
his
own
master
again
he
turned
to
his
brother
with
a
smile
you
a
friend
in
need
bernard
that
dose
has
done
me
good
open
the
window
old
fellow
will
you
let
have
some
air
bernard
flung
the
window
wide
and
the
warm
wet
air
blew
in
laden
with
the
fragrance
of
the
teeming
earth
everard
turned
his
face
to
it
drawing
in
great
breaths
the
dawn
was
breaking
she
is
better
bernard
questioned
after
a
few
moments
yes
i
believe
she
has
turned
the
corner
everard
spoke
without
turning
his
eyes
were
fixed
thank
god
said
bernard
gently
everard
right
hand
made
a
curious
movement
it
was
as
if
it
closed
upon
a
weapon
you
can
do
that
part
he
said
and
he
spoke
with
constraint
but
you
do
it
in
any
case
it
a
way
you
got
see
the
light
breaking
over
there
it
like
a
sword
turning
all
ways
he
rose
with
an
obvious
effort
and
passed
his
hand
across
his
eyes
what
of
you
man
he
said
have
they
been
looking
after
you
oh
never
mind
me
bernard
rejoined
have
something
to
eat
and
turn
in
yes
of
course
i
join
you
with
pleasure
he
clapped
an
affectionate
hand
upon
his
brother
shoulder
it
a
boy
i
told
old
fellow
i
congratulate
you
may
he
be
a
blessing
to
you
all
your
lives
i
drink
his
health
if
it
is
too
early
everard
broke
into
a
brief
discordant
laugh
you
better
go
to
church
bernard
he
said
and
pray
for
us
he
swung
away
abruptly
with
the
words
and
crossed
the
room
the
rays
of
the
new
day
smote
full
upon
him
as
he
moved
and
bernard
saw
for
the
first
time
that
his
hair
was
streaked
with
grey
chapter
iii
princess
bluebell
to
bernard
sprawling
at
his
ease
with
a
pipe
on
the
verandah
some
hours
later
the
appearance
of
a
small
girl
with
bare
brown
legs
and
a
very
abbreviated
white
muslin
frock
hugging
an
unwilling
mongoose
to
her
breast
came
as
a
surprise
for
she
entered
as
one
who
belonged
to
the
establishment
who
are
you
please
she
demanded
imperiously
halting
before
him
while
she
disentangled
the
unfortunate
scooter
rebellious
legs
from
her
hair
bernard
sat
up
and
removed
his
pipe
meeting
eyes
of
the
darkest
intensest
blue
that
he
had
ever
seen
he
gave
her
appropriate
greeting
good
morning
princess
bluebell
i
am
a
humble
homeless
beggar
at
present
living
upon
the
charity
of
my
brother
captain
monck
she
came
a
step
nearer
why
do
you
call
me
that
you
are
not
captain
monck
brother
really
are
you
he
spread
out
his
hands
with
a
deprecating
gesture
i
never
contradict
royal
ladies
princess
but
i
have
always
been
taught
to
believe
so
why
do
you
call
me
princess
she
asked
halting
between
suspicion
and
gratification
because
it
is
quite
evident
that
you
are
one
there
is
a
bossiness
about
you
that
proclaims
the
fact
aloud
bernard
smiled
upon
her
the
smile
of
open
goodfellowship
beggars
always
know
princesses
when
they
see
them
he
said
she
scrutinized
him
severely
for
a
moment
or
two
then
suddenly
melted
into
a
gleaming
responsive
smile
that
illuminated
her
little
pale
face
like
a
shaft
of
sunlight
she
came
close
to
him
and
very
graciously
proffered
scooter
for
a
caress
you
need
be
afraid
of
him
he
does
bite
she
said
i
suppose
he
is
a
bewitched
prince
is
he
asked
bernard
as
he
stroked
the
furry
little
animal
the
great
blue
eyes
were
still
fixed
upon
him
no
said
tessa
after
a
thoughtful
moment
or
two
he
only
a
mongoose
but
i
think
you
are
a
bewitched
prince
you
so
big
and
they
always
pretend
to
be
beggars
too
she
added
and
the
princesses
always
fall
in
love
with
them
before
they
find
out
said
bernard
looking
quizzical
tessa
frowned
a
little
i
do
think
falling
in
love
is
a
very
nice
game
she
said
i
seen
a
lot
of
it
have
you
indeed
bernard
eyes
screwed
up
for
a
moment
but
were
hastily
restored
to
an
expression
of
becoming
gravity
i
do
know
much
about
it
myself
he
said
you
see
i
an
old
bachelor
have
you
ever
been
in
love
asked
tessa
incredulously
he
held
out
his
hand
to
her
yes
i
in
love
at
the
present
moment
quite
the
worst
sort
too
love
at
first
sight
you
are
rather
old
are
you
said
tessa
dispassionately
but
she
laid
her
hand
in
his
notwithstanding
quite
old
enough
to
be
kissed
he
assured
her
drawing
her
gently
to
him
shall
i
tell
you
a
secret
i
rather
fond
of
kissing
little
girls
tessa
went
into
the
circle
of
his
arm
with
complete
confidence
i
mind
kissing
white
men
she
said
and
held
up
her
red
lips
but
i
would
kiss
an
indian
not
even
peter
and
he
a
darling
a
very
wise
rule
princess
said
bernard
and
i
feel
duly
honoured
how
is
my
darling
aunt
stella
this
morning
demanded
tessa
suddenly
you
made
me
forget
said
she
would
be
all
right
but
says
just
anything
is
she
all
right
she
is
better
bernard
said
but
wait
a
minute
he
caught
her
arm
as
she
made
an
impetuous
movement
to
leave
him
i
believe
she
asleep
just
now
you
do
want
to
wake
her
tessa
turned
upon
him
swiftly
wide
horror
in
her
eyes
is
that
your
way
of
telling
me
she
is
dead
she
said
in
a
whisper
no
no
child
bernard
reply
came
with
instant
reassurance
but
she
has
been
she
still
is
she
was
upset
you
know
someone
in
a
car
startled
her
i
know
i
was
there
tessa
came
close
to
him
again
speaking
in
a
tense
undertone
her
eyes
gleamed
almost
black
it
was
the
rajah
that
frightened
her
so
the
rajah
and
my
mother
i
never
going
to
ask
god
to
bless
her
again
i
hate
her
and
him
too
there
was
such
concentrated
vindictiveness
in
her
words
that
even
bernard
who
had
looked
upon
many
bitter
things
was
momentarily
startled
i
think
god
would
be
rather
sorry
to
hear
you
say
that
he
remarked
after
a
moment
he
likes
little
girls
to
pray
for
their
mothers
i
do
see
why
said
tessa
rebelliously
not
if
he
has
given
them
good
ones
mine
is
good
she
very
very
bad
then
there
all
the
more
reason
to
pray
for
her
said
bernard
the
least
you
can
do
but
i
do
think
you
ought
to
say
that
of
your
mother
you
know
even
if
you
think
it
it
is
loyal
what
loyal
said
tessa
loyalty
is
being
true
to
any
one
not
telling
tales
about
them
about
the
only
thing
i
learnt
at
school
worth
knowing
bernard
smiled
at
her
in
his
large
way
never
tell
tales
of
anyone
princess
he
said
it
is
cricket
now
look
here
i
an
awfully
interesting
piece
of
news
for
you
come
quite
close
and
i
whisper
do
you
know
last
night
when
aunt
stella
was
lying
ill
something
happened
an
angel
came
to
see
her
an
angel
tessa
eyes
grew
round
with
wonder
and
bluer
than
the
bluest
bluebell
what
was
he
like
she
whispered
breathlessly
did
you
see
him
no
i
did
i
think
it
was
a
she
bernard
whispered
back
and
what
do
you
think
she
brought
but
you
never
guess
oh
what
gasped
tessa
trembling
bernard
arm
slipped
round
her
and
scooter
with
a
sudden
violent
effort
freed
himself
and
was
gone
never
mind
i
can
get
him
again
said
tessa
or
peter
will
tell
me
quick
she
brought
bernard
was
speaking
softly
into
her
ear
a
little
think
of
that
a
present
straight
from
god
oh
how
lovely
tessa
gazed
at
him
with
shining
eyes
is
it
here
now
may
i
see
it
is
the
angel
still
here
no
the
angel
has
gone
but
the
baby
is
left
it
is
stella
very
own
and
she
is
to
take
care
of
it
oh
i
hope
she
let
me
help
her
murmured
tessa
in
accents
does
uncle
everard
know
yet
yes
he
and
i
got
here
in
the
night
two
or
three
hours
after
the
baby
arrived
he
was
very
tired
poor
chap
he
is
resting
and
the
baby
breathed
tessa
ralston
is
taking
care
of
the
baby
i
expect
it
asleep
said
bernard
so
we
keep
very
quiet
but
she
let
me
see
it
wo
she
said
tessa
anxiously
no
doubt
she
will
princess
but
i
should
disturb
them
yet
early
you
know
might
i
just
go
in
and
kiss
uncle
everard
pleaded
tessa
i
love
him
so
very
much
i
sure
he
would
mind
let
him
rest
a
bit
longer
advised
bernard
he
is
worn
out
sit
down
here
on
the
arm
of
my
chair
and
tell
me
about
yourself
where
have
you
come
from
tessa
jerked
her
head
sideways
down
there
we
live
at
the
grand
stand
we
been
there
a
long
time
now
nearly
ever
since
daddy
went
away
he
in
heaven
a
shot
him
in
the
jungle
mother
made
a
great
fuss
about
it
at
the
time
but
she
does
care
now
she
can
go
motoring
with
the
rajah
he
is
a
nasty
beast
said
tessa
with
emphasis
i
always
did
hate
him
and
he
frightened
my
darling
aunt
stella
at
the
gate
yesterday
i
could
have
killed
him
for
it
what
did
he
do
asked
bernard
i
do
know
quite
but
the
car
twisted
round
on
the
hill
and
aunt
stella
thought
it
was
going
to
upset
i
tried
to
take
care
of
her
but
we
were
both
nearly
run
over
he
a
horrid
man
tessa
declared
he
caught
hold
of
me
the
other
day
because
i
got
between
him
and
mother
when
they
were
sitting
smoking
together
and
i
bit
him
vindictive
satisfaction
sounded
in
tessa
voice
i
bit
him
hard
he
soon
let
go
again
was
he
angry
asked
bernard
oh
yes
very
angry
so
was
mother
she
told
him
he
might
whip
me
if
he
liked
fancy
being
whipped
by
a
native
high
scorn
thrilled
in
the
words
but
he
did
he
laughed
in
his
slithery
way
and
showed
his
teeth
like
a
jackal
and
said
and
said
i
was
too
pretty
to
be
whipped
tessa
ground
her
teeth
upon
the
memory
it
was
evidently
humiliating
than
the
suggested
punishment
and
then
he
kissed
me
he
kissed
me
she
shuddered
at
the
nauseating
recollection
and
let
me
go
bernard
was
listening
attentively
his
eyes
were
less
kindly
than
usual
they
had
a
steely
look
i
should
keep
out
of
his
way
if
i
were
you
he
said
i
will
i
do
declared
tessa
but
i
do
hate
the
way
he
goes
on
with
mother
he
never
have
dared
if
daddy
had
been
here
he
is
evidently
a
bounder
said
bernard
they
sat
for
some
time
on
the
verandah
growing
pleasantly
intimate
till
presently
peter
came
out
with
an
early
breakfast
for
bernard
he
invited
tessa
to
join
him
which
she
consented
to
do
with
alacrity
we
must
find
scooter
afterwards
she
said
as
she
proudly
poured
out
his
coffee
and
then
perhaps
if
i
keep
good
aunt
mary
will
let
me
see
the
baby
wonder
if
you
will
manage
to
keep
good
till
then
observed
a
voice
behind
them
she
turned
with
a
squeak
of
delight
and
sprang
to
meet
everard
he
was
looking
haggard
in
the
morning
light
but
he
smiled
upon
her
in
a
way
she
had
never
seen
before
and
he
stooped
and
kissed
her
with
a
tenderness
that
amazed
her
stella
tells
me
you
were
very
brave
yesterday
he
said
was
i
when
tessa
opened
her
blue
eyes
to
their
widest
extent
oh
i
was
only
angry
she
said
then
darling
aunt
stella
was
frightened
he
patted
her
shoulder
you
meant
to
take
care
of
her
so
i
grateful
all
the
same
he
said
tessa
clung
to
his
arm
i
like
to
come
and
take
care
of
her
always
she
said
rather
wistfully
i
can
easily
be
spared
uncle
everard
and
i
really
not
nearly
so
naughty
as
i
used
to
be
he
smiled
at
the
words
but
did
not
respond
where
scooter
he
said
they
spent
some
time
hunting
for
him
but
it
was
left
to
peter
finally
to
unearth
him
for
in
the
middle
of
the
search
ralston
came
softly
out
upon
the
verandah
with
the
baby
in
her
arms
and
at
once
all
thoughts
were
centred
upon
the
new
arrival
she
had
never
before
seen
anything
so
tiny
so
red
or
so
utterly
beautiful
bernard
left
his
breakfast
to
join
the
circle
of
admirers
and
when
the
doctor
arrived
a
few
minutes
later
he
was
in
triumphant
possession
of
the
small
bundle
that
held
them
all
spellbound
he
knew
how
to
handle
a
baby
and
was
extremely
proud
of
the
accomplishment
it
was
not
till
two
days
later
however
that
he
was
admitted
to
see
the
mother
she
had
turned
the
corner
they
said
but
she
was
terribly
weak
yet
as
soon
as
she
heard
of
the
presence
of
her
she
insisted
upon
seeing
him
everard
brought
him
in
to
her
but
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
dismissed
him
when
the
introduction
was
effected
we
shall
get
on
better
alone
she
said
with
a
smile
you
come
back
afterwards
so
everard
withdrew
and
bernard
sat
down
by
her
side
his
big
hand
holding
hers
that
is
nice
she
said
her
pale
face
turned
to
him
i
have
been
wanting
to
know
you
ever
since
everard
first
told
me
of
you
he
bent
with
a
little
smile
and
kissed
the
slender
fingers
he
held
then
the
desire
has
been
mutual
he
said
thank
you
stella
eyes
were
fixed
upon
his
face
i
was
afraid
she
said
with
slight
hesitation
that
you
might
think
when
you
saw
everard
that
marriage
had
altogether
agreed
with
him
bernard
kindly
blue
eyes
met
hers
with
absolute
directness
no
i
should
have
thought
that
he
said
but
i
see
a
change
in
him
of
course
he
is
growing
old
much
too
fast
what
is
it
overwork
i
do
know
she
still
spoke
with
hesitation
i
think
it
is
a
good
deal
anxiety
ah
bernard
hand
closed
very
strongly
upon
hers
he
is
not
the
only
person
that
suffers
from
that
complaint
i
think
she
smiled
rather
wanly
i
ought
not
to
worry
it
wrong
is
it
it
unnecessary
he
said
and
it
a
handicap
to
progress
but
difficult
not
to
when
things
go
wrong
i
admit
we
need
to
keep
a
very
tight
hold
on
faith
and
even
then
yes
even
then
stella
said
her
lips
quivering
a
little
when
the
one
beloved
is
in
danger
who
can
be
untroubled
we
are
all
in
the
same
keeping
said
bernard
gently
i
think
worth
remembering
if
we
can
trust
ourselves
to
god
we
ought
to
be
able
to
trust
even
the
one
beloved
to
his
care
stella
eyes
were
full
of
tears
i
am
afraid
i
do
know
him
well
enough
to
trust
him
like
that
she
said
bernard
leant
towards
her
my
dear
he
said
it
is
only
by
faith
that
you
can
ever
come
to
knowledge
you
have
to
trust
without
definitely
knowing
knowledge
that
inner
certainty
comes
afterwards
always
afterwards
you
ca
get
it
for
yourself
you
can
only
pray
for
it
and
prepare
the
ground
her
fingers
pressed
his
feebly
i
wonder
she
said
if
you
have
ever
known
what
it
was
to
walk
in
darkness
bernard
smiled
yes
i
have
floundered
pretty
deep
in
my
time
he
said
there
only
one
thing
for
it
you
know
just
to
keep
on
till
the
light
comes
you
find
when
the
lamp
shines
across
the
desert
at
last
that
you
not
so
far
out
of
the
track
after
all
if
you
only
keeping
on
that
the
main
thing
to
remember
ah
stella
sighed
i
believe
you
could
help
me
a
lot
delighted
to
try
said
bernard
but
she
shook
her
head
no
not
now
not
yet
i
want
you
to
take
care
of
everard
for
me
ca
he
take
care
of
himself
questioned
bernard
i
thought
i
had
taught
him
to
be
fairly
independent
oh
it
is
that
she
said
it
is
it
is
india
he
leaned
nearer
to
her
the
smile
gone
from
his
eyes
i
thought
so
he
said
you
need
be
afraid
to
speak
out
to
me
i
am
discretion
itself
especially
where
he
is
concerned
what
has
india
been
doing
to
him
with
a
faint
gesture
she
motioned
him
nearer
still
her
face
was
very
pale
but
resolution
was
shining
in
her
eyes
do
let
us
be
disturbed
she
whispered
and
i
i
will
tell
you
all
i
know
chapter
iv
the
serpent
in
the
desert
the
battalion
was
ordered
back
to
kurrumpore
for
the
winter
months
ostensibly
to
go
into
a
camp
of
exercise
though
whispers
of
some
deeper
motive
for
the
move
were
occasionally
heard
markestan
though
outwardly
calm
and
was
not
regarded
with
any
great
confidence
by
the
government
so
it
was
said
though
officially
no
one
had
the
smallest
suspicion
of
danger
it
was
with
mixed
feelings
that
stella
returned
at
length
to
the
green
bungalow
nearly
three
months
after
her
baby
birth
during
that
time
she
had
seen
a
good
deal
of
her
who
nothing
daunted
by
the
discomforts
of
the
journey
went
to
and
fro
several
times
between
bhulwana
and
the
plains
they
had
become
close
friends
and
stella
had
grown
to
regard
his
presence
as
a
safeguard
and
protection
against
the
nameless
evils
that
surrounded
everard
though
she
could
not
have
said
wherefore
he
it
was
who
with
peter
help
prepared
the
bungalow
for
her
coming
it
had
been
standing
empty
all
through
the
hot
weather
and
the
rains
the
compound
was
a
mass
of
overgrown
verdure
and
the
bungalow
itself
was
in
some
places
thick
with
fungus
when
stella
came
to
it
however
all
the
most
noticeable
traces
of
neglect
had
been
removed
the
place
was
scrubbed
clean
the
ragged
roses
had
been
trained
along
the
and
fresh
indian
matting
had
been
laid
down
everywhere
the
garden
was
still
a
wilderness
but
bernard
declared
that
he
would
have
it
in
order
before
many
weeks
had
passed
it
was
curious
how
with
his
very
limited
knowledge
of
natives
and
their
ways
he
managed
to
extract
the
most
willing
labour
from
them
peter
the
great
smiled
with
gratified
pride
whenever
he
gave
him
an
order
and
all
the
other
servants
seemed
to
entertain
a
similar
veneration
for
the
big
who
was
never
heard
to
speak
in
anger
or
impatience
and
yet
whose
word
was
one
which
somehow
no
one
found
it
possible
to
disregard
tommy
had
become
fond
of
him
also
he
was
wont
to
say
that
bernard
was
the
most
likable
fellow
he
had
ever
met
an
indefinable
barrier
had
grown
up
between
him
and
his
which
desperately
though
he
had
striven
against
it
had
made
the
old
easy
intercourse
impossible
bernard
was
in
a
fashion
the
link
between
them
strangely
they
were
always
more
intimate
in
his
presence
than
when
alone
less
conscious
of
unknown
ground
of
reserves
that
could
not
be
broached
strive
as
he
might
tommy
could
not
forget
that
evening
at
the
mess
the
historic
occasion
as
he
had
lightly
named
it
when
like
an
evil
magic
at
work
he
had
witnessed
the
smirching
of
his
hero
honour
he
had
sought
to
bury
the
matter
deep
to
thrust
it
out
of
all
remembrance
but
the
evil
wrought
was
too
subtle
and
too
potent
it
reared
itself
against
him
and
would
not
be
trampled
down
had
any
of
his
dared
to
mention
the
affair
to
him
he
would
have
been
furious
would
strenuously
have
defended
that
which
apparently
his
friend
did
not
deem
it
worth
his
while
to
defend
but
no
one
ever
spoke
of
it
it
dwelt
among
them
a
shameful
thing
ignored
yet
ever
present
everard
came
and
went
as
before
only
more
reticent
more
grim
more
unapproachable
than
he
had
ever
been
in
the
old
days
his
utter
indifference
to
the
cold
courtesy
accorded
him
was
beyond
all
scorn
he
simply
did
not
see
when
men
avoided
him
he
was
supremely
unaware
of
the
coldness
that
made
tommy
writhe
in
impotent
rebellion
he
had
never
mixed
very
freely
with
his
fellows
upon
tommy
alone
had
he
bestowed
his
actual
friendship
and
to
tommy
alone
did
he
now
display
any
definite
change
of
front
his
demeanour
towards
the
boy
was
curiously
gentle
he
never
treated
him
confidentially
or
spoke
of
intimate
things
that
invincible
barrier
which
tommy
strove
so
hard
to
ignore
he
seemed
to
take
for
granted
but
he
was
invariably
kind
in
all
his
dealings
with
him
as
if
he
realized
that
tommy
had
lost
the
one
possession
he
prized
above
all
others
and
were
sorry
for
him
whatever
tommy
mood
and
his
moods
varied
considerably
he
was
never
other
than
patient
with
him
bearing
with
him
as
he
would
never
have
borne
in
the
byegone
happier
days
of
their
good
comradeship
he
never
rebuked
him
never
offered
him
advice
never
attempted
in
any
fashion
to
test
the
influence
that
yet
remained
to
him
and
his
very
forbearance
hurt
tommy
more
poignantly
than
any
open
rupture
or
even
tacit
avoidance
could
have
hurt
him
there
were
times
when
he
would
have
sacrificed
all
he
had
even
down
to
his
own
honour
to
have
forced
an
understanding
with
monck
to
have
compelled
him
to
yield
up
his
secret
but
whenever
he
braced
himself
to
ask
for
an
explanation
he
found
himself
held
back
there
was
a
boundary
he
could
not
pass
a
force
relentless
and
irresistible
that
checked
him
at
the
very
outset
he
lacked
the
strength
to
batter
down
the
iron
will
that
opposed
him
behind
that
unaccustomed
gentleness
he
could
only
bow
miserably
to
the
unspoken
word
of
command
that
kept
him
at
a
distance
he
was
too
loyal
ever
to
discuss
the
matter
with
bernard
though
he
often
wondered
how
the
latter
regarded
his
brother
attitude
at
least
there
was
no
strain
in
their
relationship
though
he
was
fairly
convinced
that
everard
had
not
taken
bernard
into
his
confidence
this
fact
held
a
subtle
solace
for
him
for
it
meant
that
bernard
who
was
as
open
as
the
day
was
content
to
be
in
the
dark
and
satisfied
that
it
held
nothing
of
an
evil
nature
this
unquestioning
faith
on
bernard
part
was
tommy
one
ray
of
light
he
knew
instinctively
that
bernard
was
not
a
man
to
compromise
with
evil
he
carried
his
banner
that
all
might
see
he
was
not
ashamed
to
confess
his
master
before
all
men
and
tommy
mutely
admired
him
for
it
he
marked
with
pleasure
the
intimacy
that
existed
between
this
man
and
his
sister
like
stella
though
in
a
different
sense
he
had
grown
imperceptibly
to
look
upon
him
as
a
safeguard
he
was
a
sure
antidote
to
nervous
forebodings
the
advent
of
the
baby
also
gave
him
keen
delight
tommy
was
a
lover
of
all
things
youthful
he
declared
he
had
never
felt
so
much
at
home
in
india
before
peter
also
was
almost
as
much
in
the
baby
company
as
was
its
the
administration
of
the
bottle
was
peter
proudest
privilege
and
he
would
walk
to
and
fro
for
any
length
of
time
carrying
the
infant
in
his
arms
stella
was
always
content
when
the
baby
was
in
his
charge
her
confidence
in
peter
devotion
was
unbounded
the
child
was
not
very
strong
and
needed
great
care
the
care
peter
lavished
upon
it
was
as
tender
as
her
own
there
was
something
of
a
feud
between
him
and
the
but
no
trace
of
this
was
ever
apparent
in
her
presence
as
for
the
baby
he
seemed
to
love
peter
better
than
any
one
else
and
was
generally
at
his
best
when
in
his
arms
the
green
bungalow
became
a
favourite
with
the
ladies
of
the
station
somewhat
to
stella
dismay
lady
harriet
swept
in
at
all
hours
to
hold
inspections
of
the
infant
progress
and
give
advice
and
everyone
who
had
ever
had
a
baby
seemed
to
have
some
fresh
warning
or
word
of
instruction
to
bestow
they
were
all
very
kind
to
her
she
received
many
invitations
to
tea
and
smiled
over
her
sudden
popularity
but
it
dawned
upon
her
when
she
had
been
about
three
weeks
in
the
station
no
one
but
the
ralstons
seemed
to
think
of
asking
her
and
her
husband
to
dine
she
thought
but
little
of
the
omission
at
first
evening
entertainments
held
but
slight
attraction
for
her
but
as
time
went
on
and
christmas
festivities
drew
near
she
could
not
avoid
noticing
that
practically
every
invitation
she
received
was
worded
in
so
strictly
personal
a
fashion
that
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
everard
was
not
included
in
it
bernard
was
often
asked
separately
but
he
generally
refused
on
the
score
of
the
evening
being
his
best
working
time
also
after
a
while
she
could
not
fail
to
notice
that
tommy
was
no
longer
at
his
ease
in
everard
presence
the
old
careless
between
them
was
gone
and
she
missed
it
at
first
vaguely
later
with
an
uneasiness
that
she
could
not
stifle
there
was
something
in
attitude
towards
his
friend
that
hurt
her
she
knew
by
instinct
that
the
boy
was
not
happy
she
wondered
at
first
if
there
could
be
some
quarrel
between
them
but
decided
in
face
of
everard
unvarying
kindness
to
tommy
that
this
could
not
be
another
thing
struck
her
as
time
went
on
everard
always
checked
all
talk
of
his
prospects
he
was
so
repressive
on
the
subject
that
she
could
not
possibly
pursue
it
and
she
came
at
last
to
conclude
that
his
hope
of
preferment
had
vanished
like
a
mirage
in
the
desert
he
was
very
good
to
her
but
his
absences
continued
in
the
old
unaccountable
way
and
her
dread
of
rustam
karin
which
presence
had
in
a
measure
allayed
revived
again
till
at
times
it
was
almost
more
than
she
could
bear
she
did
not
talk
of
it
any
further
to
bernard
she
had
told
him
all
her
fears
and
she
knew
he
was
on
guard
knew
instinctively
that
she
could
count
upon
him
though
he
never
reverted
to
the
matter
somehow
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
speak
to
him
of
the
strange
avoidance
of
her
husband
that
was
being
practised
by
the
rest
of
the
station
either
she
endured
it
dumbly
holding
herself
more
and
more
aloof
in
consequence
of
it
as
the
days
went
by
ever
since
the
days
of
her
own
ostracism
she
had
placed
a
very
light
price
upon
social
popularity
the
love
of
such
women
as
mary
ralston
and
the
love
of
little
tessa
were
of
infinitely
greater
value
in
her
eyes
tessa
and
her
mother
were
once
more
guests
in
the
ralstons
bungalow
netta
had
desired
to
stay
at
the
new
hotel
which
as
also
at
udalkland
native
enterprise
had
erected
near
the
club
but
ralston
had
vetoed
this
plan
with
much
firmness
and
after
a
little
petulant
argument
netta
had
given
in
she
did
not
greatly
care
for
staying
with
the
ralstons
mary
was
a
dear
good
soul
of
course
but
inclined
to
be
interfering
and
now
that
the
zest
of
life
was
returning
to
netta
her
desire
for
her
own
way
was
beginning
to
reassert
itself
however
the
ralstons
bungalow
also
was
in
close
proximity
to
the
club
and
in
consideration
of
this
she
consented
to
take
up
her
abode
there
her
days
of
seclusion
were
over
she
had
emerged
from
them
with
a
fevered
craving
for
excitement
of
any
description
mingled
with
that
odd
defiance
that
had
characterized
her
almost
ever
since
her
husband
death
she
had
never
kept
any
very
great
control
upon
her
tongue
but
now
it
was
positively
venomous
she
seemed
to
bear
a
grudge
against
all
the
world
tessa
with
her
beloved
scooter
went
her
own
way
as
of
yore
and
spent
most
of
her
time
at
the
green
bungalow
where
there
was
always
someone
to
welcome
her
she
arrived
there
one
day
in
a
state
of
great
indignation
scooter
as
usual
clinging
to
her
hair
and
trying
his
utmost
to
escape
like
a
whirlwind
she
burst
upon
stella
who
was
sitting
with
her
baby
in
the
french
window
of
her
room
aunt
stella
she
cried
breathlessly
mother
says
she
sure
you
and
uncle
everard
wo
go
to
the
officers
picnic
at
khanmulla
this
year
it
is
true
is
it
aunt
stella
you
will
go
and
you
take
me
with
you
wo
you
the
officers
picnic
at
khanmulla
the
words
called
up
a
flood
of
memory
in
stella
heart
she
looked
at
tessa
the
smile
of
welcome
still
upon
her
face
but
she
did
not
see
her
she
was
standing
once
more
in
the
moonlight
listening
to
the
tread
of
a
man
feet
on
the
path
below
her
waiting
waiting
with
a
throbbing
heart
for
the
sound
of
a
man
quiet
voice
tessa
came
nearer
to
her
looking
at
her
with
an
odd
species
of
speculation
aunt
stella
she
said
that
was
all
mother
said
she
made
me
very
very
angry
shall
i
tell
you
would
you
like
to
know
why
stella
eyes
ceased
to
gaze
into
distance
she
looked
at
the
child
some
vague
misgiving
stirred
within
her
it
was
the
instinct
of
that
moved
her
to
say
i
do
want
to
listen
to
any
silly
gossip
tessa
darling
it
is
silly
declared
tessa
it
much
worse
than
that
and
going
to
tell
you
cos
i
think
i
better
she
said
that
everybody
says
that
uncle
everard
wo
go
to
the
picnic
on
christmas
eve
cos
ashamed
to
look
people
in
the
face
i
said
it
was
true
very
stoutly
tessa
brought
out
the
assertion
then
a
moment
later
with
a
queer
sidelong
glance
into
stella
face
it
is
true
dear
is
it
ashamed
everard
ashamed
stella
hands
clasped
each
other
unconsciously
about
the
sleeping
baby
on
her
lap
strangely
her
own
voice
came
to
her
while
she
was
not
even
aware
of
uttering
the
words
why
should
he
be
ashamed
tessa
eyes
were
dark
with
mystery
she
pressed
against
stella
with
a
small
protective
gesture
darling
she
said
horrid
things
but
they
are
true
any
of
them
if
uncle
everard
had
been
there
she
have
dared
i
told
her
so
with
an
effort
stella
unclasped
her
hands
she
put
her
arm
around
the
little
girl
tell
me
what
they
are
saying
tessa
she
said
i
think
with
you
that
i
had
better
know
tessa
suffered
scooter
to
escape
in
order
to
hug
stella
close
they
are
saying
things
about
when
he
went
on
leave
just
after
you
married
captain
dacre
how
he
said
he
wanted
to
go
to
england
and
did
go
and
how
how
tessa
checked
herself
abruptly
it
came
out
at
mess
one
night
she
ended
a
faint
smile
of
relief
shone
in
stella
eyes
but
i
knew
that
tessa
she
said
he
told
me
himself
is
that
all
you
knew
tessa
eyes
shone
with
sudden
triumph
oh
then
do
tell
them
what
he
was
doing
and
stop
their
horrid
talking
it
was
burton
began
it
i
always
did
hate
her
i
ca
tell
them
what
he
was
doing
stella
said
feeling
her
heart
sink
again
you
ca
oh
keen
disappointment
sounded
in
tessa
voice
but
he
would
she
added
reflectively
if
he
knew
what
beasts
they
all
are
shall
i
ask
him
to
aunt
stella
tell
me
first
what
they
are
saying
stella
said
bracing
herself
to
face
the
inevitable
tessa
looked
at
her
dubiously
for
a
moment
somehow
she
would
have
found
it
easier
to
tell
this
thing
to
monck
himself
than
to
stella
and
yet
she
had
a
feeling
that
it
must
be
told
that
stella
ought
to
know
she
clung
a
little
closer
to
her
i
always
did
hate
major
burton
she
said
sweepingly
i
know
he
started
it
in
the
first
place
he
said
and
now
she
says
that
that
it
very
funny
that
the
leave
uncle
everard
had
when
he
pretended
to
go
to
england
should
have
come
just
at
the
time
that
captain
dacre
was
killed
in
the
mountains
and
that
a
horrid
old
man
uncle
everard
knows
called
rustam
karin
who
lives
in
the
bazaar
was
away
at
the
same
time
and
they
just
wonder
if
he
the
old
man
had
anything
to
do
with
captain
dacre
dying
like
he
did
and
if
uncle
everard
knows
something
about
it
that
how
they
put
it
aunt
stella
mother
only
told
me
to
tease
me
but
that
what
they
say
she
stopped
pressing
stella
hand
very
tightly
to
her
little
quivering
bosom
and
there
followed
a
pause
a
deep
silence
that
seemed
to
have
in
it
something
of
an
almost
suffocating
quality
tessa
moved
at
last
because
it
became
unbearable
moved
and
looked
down
into
stella
face
as
if
half
afraid
she
could
not
have
said
what
she
expected
to
see
there
but
she
was
undoubtedly
relieved
when
the
beautiful
face
white
as
death
though
it
was
smiled
back
at
her
without
a
tremor
stella
kissed
her
tenderly
and
let
her
go
thank
you
for
telling
me
darling
she
said
gently
it
is
just
as
well
that
i
should
know
what
people
say
even
though
it
is
nothing
but
idle
gossip
idle
gossip
she
repeated
the
words
with
emphasis
run
and
find
scooter
sweetheart
she
said
and
put
all
this
silly
nonsense
out
of
your
dear
little
head
for
good
i
must
take
baby
to
now
by
and
by
we
will
read
a
together
and
enjoy
ourselves
tessa
ran
away
comforted
yet
also
vaguely
uneasy
her
tenderness
notwithstanding
there
was
something
not
quite
normal
about
dismissal
of
her
this
kind
friend
of
hers
had
never
sent
her
away
quite
so
summarily
before
it
was
almost
as
if
she
were
half
afraid
that
tessa
might
see
or
guess
too
much
as
for
stella
she
carried
her
baby
to
the
and
then
shut
herself
into
her
own
room
where
she
remained
for
a
long
time
face
to
face
with
these
new
doubts
he
had
loved
her
before
her
marriage
he
had
called
their
union
kismet
he
wielded
a
strange
almost
an
uncanny
power
among
natives
and
there
was
rustam
karin
whom
long
ago
she
had
secretly
credited
with
ralph
dacre
death
the
serpent
in
the
garden
the
serpent
in
the
desert
also
whose
evil
coils
it
seemed
to
her
were
daily
tightening
round
her
heart
chapter
v
the
woman
way
it
was
three
days
later
that
tommy
came
striding
in
from
the
in
great
excitement
with
the
news
that
captain
ermsted
murderer
had
been
arrested
all
honour
to
everard
he
said
flinging
himself
into
a
chair
by
stella
side
the
fellow
was
caught
at
khanmulla
barnes
arrested
him
but
he
gives
the
credit
of
the
catch
to
everard
the
fellow
will
swing
of
course
it
will
be
a
sensational
trial
for
rumour
has
it
that
the
rajah
was
pushing
behind
he
of
course
is
smooth
as
oil
i
saw
him
at
the
club
just
now
hovering
round
ermsted
as
usual
and
she
encouraging
him
that
girl
is
positively
infatuated
should
wonder
if
there
a
rude
awakening
before
her
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
you
spoke
he
turned
abruptly
to
bernard
who
was
seated
near
i
was
only
wondering
what
everard
share
had
been
in
tracking
this
charming
person
down
observed
the
elder
monck
who
was
smiling
a
little
at
tommy
evident
excitement
oh
everyone
knows
that
everard
is
a
regular
said
tommy
he
is
more
native
than
the
natives
when
there
is
anything
of
this
kind
in
the
wind
he
is
a
born
detective
and
he
and
that
old
chap
in
the
bazaar
are
such
a
strong
combination
that
they
are
practically
infallible
and
invincible
do
you
mean
rustam
karin
stella
spoke
very
quietly
not
lifting
her
eyes
from
her
work
tommy
turned
to
her
that
the
chap
the
old
beggar
fellow
at
least
they
say
he
is
he
never
shows
hafiz
does
all
the
show
part
the
old
boy
is
the
brain
that
works
the
wires
everard
has
immense
faith
in
him
i
know
stella
said
her
voice
sounded
strangled
and
bernard
looked
across
at
her
but
she
continued
to
work
without
looking
up
tommy
lingered
for
a
while
expatiating
upon
everard
astuteness
and
finally
went
away
to
dress
for
mess
still
in
a
state
of
considerable
excitement
stella
and
bernard
sat
in
silence
after
his
departure
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
to
say
but
when
after
a
time
he
got
up
to
go
she
very
suddenly
raised
her
eyes
bernard
my
dear
he
said
very
kindly
she
put
out
a
hand
to
him
almost
as
if
feeling
her
way
in
a
dark
place
i
want
to
ask
you
she
said
speaking
hurriedly
whether
you
know
whether
you
have
ever
heard
the
things
that
are
being
said
about
about
everard
and
this
man
rustam
karin
she
spoke
with
immense
effort
it
was
evident
that
she
was
greatly
agitated
bernard
stopped
beside
her
holding
her
hand
firmly
in
his
tell
me
what
they
are
he
said
gently
she
made
a
hopeless
gesture
then
you
do
know
everyone
knows
naturally
i
am
the
last
you
knew
i
connected
that
dreadful
man
long
ago
with
with
ralph
death
i
had
good
reason
for
doing
so
after
after
i
had
actually
seen
him
on
the
verandah
here
that
awful
night
but
but
now
it
seems
because
he
and
everard
have
always
been
in
partnership
because
they
were
both
absent
at
the
time
of
ralph
death
no
one
knew
where
people
are
talking
and
saying
and
saying
she
broke
off
with
a
sharp
agonized
sound
i
ca
tell
you
what
they
are
saying
she
whispered
it
is
false
said
bernard
stoutly
it
a
foul
lie
of
the
devil
own
concocting
how
long
have
you
known
of
this
who
was
vile
enough
to
tell
you
you
knew
she
whispered
i
never
heard
the
thing
put
into
words
but
i
had
my
own
suspicions
of
what
was
going
about
he
admitted
but
i
never
believed
it
nothing
on
this
earth
would
induce
me
to
believe
it
you
do
believe
it
either
child
you
know
him
better
than
that
she
hid
her
face
from
him
with
a
smothered
sob
i
thought
i
did
once
you
did
he
asserted
staunchly
you
do
do
tell
me
otherwise
for
i
sha
believe
you
if
you
do
what
kind
friend
told
you
i
want
to
know
oh
it
was
only
little
tessa
you
must
blame
her
she
was
full
of
indignation
poor
child
her
mother
taunted
her
with
it
you
know
or
perhaps
you
do
know
what
netta
ermsted
is
bernard
face
was
very
grim
as
he
made
reply
i
think
i
can
guess
but
you
are
not
going
to
be
poisoned
by
her
venom
why
do
you
tell
everard
have
it
out
with
him
say
you
do
believe
it
but
it
hurts
you
to
hear
a
damnable
slander
like
this
and
not
be
able
to
refute
it
you
are
not
afraid
of
him
stella
surely
you
are
not
afraid
of
him
but
stella
only
hid
her
face
a
little
lower
and
spoke
no
word
he
laid
his
hand
upon
her
as
she
sat
what
does
that
mean
he
said
is
your
love
equal
to
the
strain
she
shook
her
head
dumbly
she
could
not
meet
his
look
what
he
said
is
my
love
greater
than
yours
then
i
would
trust
his
honour
even
to
the
gallows
if
need
be
ca
you
say
as
much
she
answered
him
with
her
head
bowed
her
words
barely
audible
it
is
a
question
of
love
i
should
always
love
him
whatever
he
did
ah
the
flicker
of
a
smile
crossed
bernard
face
that
is
the
woman
way
there
a
good
deal
to
be
said
for
it
i
daresay
yes
yes
quiveringly
she
made
answer
but
if
this
thing
were
true
my
love
would
have
to
be
sacrificed
even
even
though
it
would
mean
tearing
out
my
very
heart
i
could
go
on
with
him
i
could
possibly
her
words
trembled
into
silence
and
the
light
died
out
of
eyes
i
see
he
said
slowly
but
my
dear
i
ca
understand
how
you
loving
him
as
you
do
can
allow
for
a
moment
even
in
your
most
secret
heart
that
such
a
thing
as
this
could
be
true
that
is
where
you
begin
to
go
wrong
that
is
what
does
the
harm
she
looked
up
at
last
and
the
despair
in
her
eyes
went
straight
to
his
heart
i
have
always
felt
there
was
something
she
said
i
tell
you
exactly
how
but
it
has
always
been
there
i
tried
hard
not
to
love
him
not
to
marry
him
but
it
was
no
use
he
mastered
me
with
his
love
but
i
always
knew
i
always
knew
that
there
was
something
hidden
which
i
might
not
see
i
have
caught
sight
of
it
a
dozen
times
but
i
have
never
really
seen
it
she
suppressed
a
quick
shudder
i
have
been
afraid
of
it
and
i
have
always
looked
the
other
way
a
mistake
bernard
said
you
should
always
face
your
bogies
they
have
a
trick
of
swelling
out
of
all
proportion
to
their
actual
size
if
you
do
yes
i
know
i
know
stella
pressed
his
hand
and
withdrew
her
own
you
are
very
good
she
said
i
could
have
said
this
to
any
one
but
you
i
ca
speak
to
everard
it
is
entirely
my
own
weakness
he
holds
me
off
he
makes
me
feel
that
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
speak
will
you
let
me
bernard
suggested
taking
out
his
pipe
and
frowning
over
it
she
shook
her
head
instantly
no
no
i
am
sure
he
would
answer
you
and
and
it
would
hurt
him
to
know
that
i
had
turned
to
any
one
else
even
to
you
it
would
only
make
things
more
difficult
to
bear
she
stopped
short
with
a
nervous
gesture
he
is
coming
now
she
said
there
was
a
sound
of
horse
hoofs
at
the
gate
and
in
a
moment
everard
monck
came
into
view
riding
his
tall
waler
which
was
smothered
with
dust
and
foam
he
waved
to
his
wife
as
he
rode
up
the
broad
path
his
dark
face
was
alight
with
a
grim
triumph
a
ran
forward
to
take
his
animal
and
he
slid
to
the
ground
and
stamped
his
feet
as
if
stiff
then
without
haste
he
mounted
the
steps
and
came
to
them
i
am
not
fit
to
come
near
you
he
said
as
he
drew
near
i
have
been
right
across
the
desert
to
udalkhand
and
had
to
do
some
hard
riding
to
get
back
in
time
he
pulled
off
his
glove
and
just
touched
cheek
in
passing
hullo
bernard
about
time
for
a
drink
is
it
he
looked
momentarily
surprised
when
stella
swiftly
turned
her
head
and
kissed
the
hand
that
had
so
lightly
caressed
her
he
stopped
beside
her
and
laid
it
on
her
shoulder
i
am
afraid
you
wo
approve
of
me
when
i
tell
you
what
i
have
been
doing
he
said
she
looked
up
at
him
i
know
tommy
came
in
and
told
us
you
seem
to
have
done
something
rather
great
i
suppose
we
ought
to
congratulate
you
he
smiled
a
little
it
is
always
satisfactory
when
a
murderer
gets
his
deserts
he
said
though
i
am
afraid
the
man
who
does
the
job
is
not
in
all
cases
the
prime
malefactor
ah
stella
said
she
folded
up
her
work
with
hands
that
were
not
quite
steady
her
face
was
very
pale
everard
stood
looking
down
at
the
burnished
coils
of
her
hair
are
you
going
to
the
dance
at
the
club
he
asked
after
a
moment
she
shook
her
head
instantly
no
why
not
he
questioned
she
leaned
back
in
her
chair
and
looked
up
at
him
as
you
know
i
never
was
particularly
fond
of
the
station
society
he
frowned
a
little
it
better
than
nothing
you
are
too
given
to
shutting
yourself
up
bernard
thinks
so
too
stella
glanced
towards
her
with
a
slight
lift
of
the
eyebrows
i
do
think
he
does
but
in
any
case
we
are
engaged
it
is
tessa
birthday
and
she
and
scooter
are
coming
to
dine
coming
to
dine
what
on
earth
for
everard
looked
his
astonishment
my
doing
said
bernard
it
a
stella
very
kindly
fell
in
with
the
plan
but
it
originated
with
me
you
see
princess
bluebell
is
ten
years
old
and
quite
grown
up
ralston
had
a
children
party
for
her
this
afternoon
which
i
was
privileged
to
attend
i
must
say
tessa
made
a
charming
hostess
but
she
confided
to
me
at
parting
that
the
desire
of
her
life
was
to
play
cinderella
and
go
out
to
dinner
in
a
all
by
herself
so
i
undertook
then
and
there
that
a
should
be
waiting
for
her
at
the
gate
at
eight
and
she
should
have
a
stodgy
entertainment
to
follow
she
was
delighted
with
the
idea
poor
little
soul
the
ralstons
are
going
to
the
club
dance
and
of
course
ermsted
also
but
tommy
is
giving
up
the
first
half
to
come
and
amuse
cinderella
ralston
thinks
the
child
will
be
ill
with
so
much
excitement
but
a
tenth
birthday
is
something
of
an
occasion
as
i
pointed
out
and
she
certainly
behaved
wonderfully
well
this
afternoon
though
she
was
about
the
only
child
who
did
i
nearly
throttled
the
burton
youngster
for
kicking
the
little
brute
he
seemed
to
think
it
was
a
very
ordinary
thing
to
do
bernard
stopped
himself
with
a
laugh
you
be
bored
with
all
this
and
i
must
go
and
make
ready
there
are
to
be
chinese
lanterns
to
light
the
way
and
a
strip
of
red
cloth
on
the
steps
peter
is
helping
as
usual
peter
the
invaluable
we
sha
keep
it
up
very
late
will
you
join
us
or
are
you
also
bound
for
the
club
i
will
join
you
with
pleasure
everard
said
i
have
seen
the
imp
for
some
days
there
has
been
too
much
on
hand
how
is
the
boy
stella
shall
we
go
and
say
to
him
stella
had
risen
she
put
her
hand
through
his
arm
bernard
and
tommy
are
to
do
all
the
entertaining
and
you
and
i
can
amuse
each
other
for
once
we
do
often
have
such
a
chance
she
smiled
as
she
spoke
but
her
lips
were
quivering
bernard
sauntered
away
and
as
he
went
everard
stooped
and
kissed
her
upturned
face
he
did
not
speak
and
she
clung
to
him
for
a
moment
passionately
close
wherefore
she
could
not
have
said
but
there
was
in
her
embrace
something
to
restrain
her
tears
she
forced
them
back
with
her
utmost
resolution
as
they
went
together
to
see
their
child
chapter
vi
the
surprise
party
punctually
at
eight
tessa
arrived
slightly
awed
but
supremely
happy
seated
in
a
escorted
by
bernard
and
hugging
the
beloved
scooter
to
her
eager
little
breast
her
eyes
were
shining
with
mysterious
expectation
as
her
cavalier
handed
her
from
her
chariot
up
the
steps
she
moved
as
one
who
treads
enchanted
ground
the
little
creature
in
her
arms
wore
an
air
of
deep
suspicion
his
pointed
head
turned
to
and
fro
with
movements
his
sharp
red
eyes
darted
hither
and
thither
almost
apprehensively
he
was
like
a
toy
on
wires
he
is
going
to
turn
into
a
fairy
prince
soon
explained
tessa
i
not
sure
that
he
quite
likes
the
idea
though
he
would
rather
kill
a
dragon
he
do
both
agreed
bernard
he
led
the
little
girl
along
the
vernadah
under
the
bobbing
lanterns
tessa
looked
about
her
critically
there
are
any
other
children
are
there
she
said
not
one
said
bernard
unless
you
count
me
we
are
going
to
dine
together
you
and
i
quite
alone
if
you
can
put
up
with
me
and
after
that
we
will
hold
a
reception
for
only
i
shall
like
that
said
tessa
graciously
ah
here
is
peter
peter
will
you
please
bring
a
box
for
scooter
while
i
have
my
dinner
he
wants
to
go
she
added
to
bernard
and
if
he
does
that
i
sha
have
him
again
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
you
do
get
snakes
this
time
of
year
do
you
asked
bernard
oh
yes
sometimes
i
saw
one
the
other
day
when
i
was
out
with
major
ralston
he
tried
to
kill
it
with
his
stick
but
it
got
away
and
scooter
was
there
they
like
to
hide
under
bits
of
carpet
like
this
said
tessa
in
an
instructive
tone
pointing
to
the
strip
that
had
been
laid
in
her
honour
are
you
afraid
of
snakes
uncle
st
bernard
yes
said
bernard
with
simplicity
are
you
tessa
looked
slightly
surprised
at
the
admission
i
do
know
i
expect
i
am
peter
is
peter
very
brave
he
has
been
more
or
less
brought
up
with
them
said
bernard
scorpions
too
he
smiled
the
other
day
when
i
fled
from
a
scorpion
in
the
garden
and
i
believe
he
has
a
positively
fatherly
feeling
for
rats
tessa
shivered
a
little
scooter
killed
a
rat
the
other
day
and
it
squealed
dreadfully
i
do
think
he
ought
to
do
things
like
that
but
of
course
he
does
know
any
better
he
looks
as
if
he
knows
a
lot
said
bernard
yes
i
wish
he
would
learn
to
talk
he
awful
clever
do
you
think
we
could
ever
teach
him
asked
tessa
bernard
shook
his
head
no
it
would
take
a
magician
to
do
that
we
are
not
clever
enough
either
of
us
peter
now
oh
is
peter
a
magician
said
tessa
with
shining
eyes
peter
dear
peter
turning
to
him
ecstatically
as
he
appeared
with
a
box
in
which
to
imprison
her
darling
do
you
think
you
could
possibly
teach
my
little
scooter
to
talk
peter
smiled
all
over
his
bronze
countenance
missy
only
the
holy
ones
can
do
that
he
said
tessa
face
fell
that
as
bad
as
telling
you
to
pray
for
anything
is
it
she
said
to
bernard
and
my
prayers
never
come
true
do
yours
they
always
get
answered
said
bernard
some
time
or
other
oh
do
they
tessa
regarded
him
with
interest
does
god
come
and
talk
to
you
then
she
said
he
smiled
a
little
he
speaks
to
all
who
wait
to
hear
my
princess
he
said
only
to
said
tessa
looking
incredulous
bernard
put
his
arm
round
her
no
he
said
it
the
children
who
come
first
with
him
he
may
not
give
them
just
what
they
ask
for
but
it
generally
something
better
tessa
stared
at
him
her
eyes
round
and
dark
she
said
suddenly
a
big
snake
was
to
come
out
of
that
corner
and
i
was
to
say
let
it
bite
me
lord
do
you
think
it
would
no
said
bernard
very
decidedly
oh
said
tessa
well
i
wish
one
would
then
for
i
love
to
see
if
it
would
or
not
bernard
pulled
her
to
him
and
kissed
her
we
wo
talk
any
more
about
snakes
or
you
be
dreaming
of
them
he
said
come
along
and
dine
with
me
rather
sport
having
it
all
to
ourselves
eh
where
aunt
stella
and
uncle
everard
asked
tessa
oh
they
preparing
for
the
reception
let
me
take
your
cloak
this
is
the
he
threw
the
cloak
over
a
chair
in
the
verandah
and
led
her
into
the
where
a
small
table
lighted
by
candles
with
crimson
shades
awaited
them
how
pretty
cried
tessa
clapping
her
hands
peter
in
snowy
attire
benign
and
magnificent
attended
to
their
wants
and
the
feast
proceeded
vastly
enjoyed
by
both
tessa
had
never
been
so
in
all
her
small
life
before
when
at
the
end
of
the
repast
to
an
accompaniment
of
nuts
and
sweetmeats
bernard
poured
her
a
tiny
liqueur
glass
of
wine
her
delight
knew
no
bounds
i
never
enjoyed
myself
so
much
before
she
declared
what
a
ducky
little
glass
now
i
going
to
drink
your
health
no
i
drink
yours
first
bernard
arose
holding
his
glass
high
i
drink
to
the
princess
bluebell
may
she
grow
fairer
every
day
and
may
her
cup
of
blessing
be
always
full

said
tessa
and
now
uncle
bernard
i
going
to
drink
to
you
may
you
always
have
lots
to
laugh
at
and
may
your
prayers
always
come
true
that
rhymes
does
it
she
added
complacently
do
i
drink
all
my
wine
now
or
only
a
sip
depends
said
bernard
how
does
it
depend
it
depends
on
how
much
you
love
me
he
explained
if
there
any
one
else
you
love
better
you
save
a
little
for
him
she
looked
straight
at
him
with
a
hint
of
embarrassment
in
her
eyes
i
afraid
i
love
uncle
everard
best
she
said
bernard
smiled
upon
her
with
reassuring
kindliness
quite
right
my
child
so
you
ought
there
tommy
too
and
aunt
stella
i
am
sure
you
want
to
drink
to
them
tessa
slipped
round
the
table
to
his
side
clasping
her
glass
tightly
as
she
came
within
the
circle
of
his
arm
she
whispered
yes
i
love
them
ever
such
a
lot
but
i
love
you
best
of
all
except
uncle
everard
and
he
does
want
me
when
he
got
aunt
stella
i
you
never
wanted
a
little
girl
for
your
very
own
did
you
he
looked
down
at
her
his
blue
eyes
full
of
tenderness
i
often
wanted
you
tessa
he
said
have
you
she
beamed
upon
him
rubbing
her
flushed
cheek
against
his
shoulder
i
sure
you
can
have
me
if
you
like
she
said
he
pressed
her
to
him
i
do
think
your
mother
would
agree
to
that
you
know
tessa
red
lips
pouted
disgust
oh
she
would
care
she
never
cares
what
i
do
she
likes
it
much
best
when
i
not
there
bernard
brows
were
slightly
drawn
his
arm
held
the
little
slim
body
very
closely
to
him
you
and
i
would
be
so
happy
insinuated
tessa
as
he
did
not
speak
i
do
as
you
told
me
always
and
i
never
never
be
rude
to
you
he
bent
and
kissed
her

know
that
my
darling
and
when
you
got
old
dear
uncle
bernard
really
old
i
mean
take
such
care
of
you
she
proceeded
i
be
more
than
a
daughter
to
you
ah
he
said
i
should
like
that
my
princess
of
the
bluebell
eyes
you
would
she
looked
at
him
eagerly
then
do
you
think
you
might
tell
mother
you
have
me
i
know
she
would
mind
he
smiled
at
her
impetuosity
we
must
be
patient
my
princess
he
said
these
things
ca
be
done
offhand
if
at
all
she
slid
her
arm
round
his
neck
and
hugged
him
but
there
is
the
weeniest
teeniest
chance
is
there
you
do
think
you
like
to
have
me
if
i
was
good
and
i
love
to
belong
to
you
is
there
just
the
little
chance
uncle
bernard
would
it
be
any
good
praying
for
it
he
took
her
little
hand
into
his
warm
kind
grasp
for
she
was
quivering
all
over
with
excitement
yes
pray
little
one
he
said
you
may
not
get
exactly
what
you
want
but
there
will
be
an
answer
if
you
keep
on
be
sure
of
that
tessa
nodded
comprehension
all
right
i
will
and
you
will
too
you
it
be
fun
both
praying
for
the
same
thing
wo
it
oh
my
wine
i
nearly
spilt
it
better
drink
it
and
make
it
safe
he
said
with
a
twinkle
i
going
to
drink
mine
and
then
we
go
on
to
the
verandah
and
wait
for
something
to
happen
is
something
going
to
happen
asked
tessa
with
a
shiver
of
delighted
anticipation
he
laughed
perhaps
if
we
live
long
enough
tessa
drank
her
wine
almost
casually
come
on
she
said
let
go
but
ere
they
reached
the
french
window
that
led
on
to
the
verandah
a
sudden
loud
report
followed
by
a
succession
of
minor
ones
coming
from
the
compound
told
them
that
the
happenings
had
already
begun
tessa
gave
one
great
jump
and
then
literally
danced
with
delight
fireworks
she
cried
fireworks
that
tommy
i
know
it
is
do
go
and
look
they
went
and
hung
over
the
to
watch
a
masked
figure
attired
in
an
old
pyjama
suit
of
vivid
green
and
white
whirling
a
magnificent
wheel
of
fire
that
scattered
glowing
sparks
in
all
directions
tessa
was
wild
with
excitement
how
lovely
she
cried
oh
how
lovely
dear
uncle
bernard
may
i
go
down
and
help
him
but
bernard
decreed
that
she
should
remain
upon
the
verandah
and
strangely
tessa
submitted
without
protest
she
held
his
hand
tightly
as
if
to
prevent
herself
making
any
inadvertent
dash
for
freedom
but
she
leapt
to
and
fro
like
a
dog
on
the
leash
squeaking
her
ecstasy
at
every
fresh
display
achieved
by
the
bizarre
masked
figure
below
them
bernard
watched
her
with
compassionate
sympathy
in
his
kindly
eyes
little
tessa
had
won
a
very
warm
place
in
his
heart
he
marvelled
at
her
mother
attitude
of
callous
indifference
certainly
tessa
had
never
enjoyed
herself
more
thoroughly
than
on
that
evening
of
her
tenth
birthday
time
flew
by
on
the
wings
of
delight
tommy
exhibition
was
appreciated
with
almost
delirious
enthusiasm
on
the
verandah
and
a
little
crowd
of
natives
at
the
gate
pushed
and
nudged
each
other
with
an
admiration
quite
as
heartfelt
though
carefully
suppressed
the
display
had
been
going
on
for
some
time
when
stella
came
out
alone
and
joined
the
two
on
the
verandah
to
tessa
eager
inquiry
for
uncle
everard
she
made
answer
that
he
had
been
called
out
on
business
and
to
bernard
she
added
that
hafiz
had
sent
him
a
message
by
one
of
the
servants
and
she
supposed
he
had
gone
to
rustam
karin
stall
in
the
bazaar
she
looked
pale
and
dispirited
but
she
joined
in
delighted
appreciation
of
the
entertainment
which
now
was
drawing
to
a
close
it
was
getting
late
and
as
with
a
shower
of
coloured
stars
the
magician
in
the
compound
accomplished
a
grand
bernard
put
his
arm
around
the
narrow
shoulders
and
said
with
a
kindly
squeeze
i
am
going
to
see
my
princess
home
again
now
she
must
lose
all
her
she
lifted
her
face
to
kiss
him
it
has
been
lovely
she
said
i
do
wish
i
need
go
back
do
you
think
aunt
mary
would
mind
if
i
stayed
with
you
he
smiled
at
her
whimsically
perhaps
not
princess
but
i
am
going
to
take
you
back
to
her
all
the
same
say
to
aunt
stella
she
looks
as
if
a
good
dose
of
bed
would
do
her
good
tommy
with
his
mask
in
his
hand
came
running
up
the
and
tessa
sprang
to
meet
him
oh
tommy
darling
i
have
enjoyed
myself
so
he
kissed
her
lightly
that
all
right
scaramouch
so
have
i
must
get
out
of
this
toggery
now
i
suppose
you
are
off
in
your
i
walk
with
you
it
be
on
the
way
to
the
club
oh
how
lovely
you
on
one
side
and
uncle
bernard
on
the
other
cried
tessa
the
princess
will
travel
in
state
observed
bernard
ah
here
comes
peter
with
scooter
have
your
cloak
on
before
you
take
him
out
the
cloak
had
fallen
from
the
chair
peter
set
down
scooter
in
his
prison
and
picked
it
up
by
the
light
of
the
bobbing
coloured
lanterns
he
placed
it
about
her
shoulders
tessa
suddenly
turned
and
sat
down
my
shoe
is
undone
she
said
extending
her
foot
with
a
royal
air
where
is
the
prince
the
words
were
hardly
out
of
her
mouth
before
another
sound
escaped
her
which
she
hastily
caught
back
as
though
instinct
had
stifled
it
in
her
throat
look
she
gasped
peter
was
nearest
to
her
he
had
bent
to
release
scooter
but
like
a
streak
of
light
he
straightened
himself
he
saw
before
any
one
else
had
time
to
realize
the
hideous
thing
that
writhed
in
momentary
entanglement
in
the
folds
of
tessa
cloak
and
then
suddenly
reared
itself
upon
her
lap
as
she
sat
frozen
stiff
with
horror
he
stooped
over
the
child
his
hands
outspread
waiting
for
the
moment
to
swoop
missy
not
move
not
move
he
said
softly
above
her
my
missy
not
going
to
be
hurt
peter
taking
care
of
missy
and
with
glassy
eyes
fixed
and
white
lips
rigid
tessa
strained
whisper
came
in
answer
o
lord
do
let
it
bite
me
tommy
would
have
flung
himself
forward
then
but
bernard
caught
and
held
him
he
had
seen
the
look
in
the
indian
eyes
and
he
knew
beyond
all
doubting
that
tessa
was
safe
if
any
human
power
could
make
her
so
stella
knew
it
also
in
that
moment
peter
loomed
gigantic
to
her
his
gleaming
eyes
and
strangely
smiling
face
held
her
spellbound
with
a
fascination
greater
even
than
that
wicked
vibrating
thing
that
coiled
black
and
evil
on
the
white
of
tessa
frock
could
command
she
knew
that
if
none
intervened
peter
would
accomplish
tessa
deliverance
but
there
was
one
factor
which
they
had
all
forgotten
in
those
tense
seconds
scooter
the
mongoose
by
some
means
invisible
became
aware
of
the
presence
of
the
enemy
the
lid
of
his
box
had
already
been
loosened
by
peter
with
a
frantic
effort
he
forced
it
up
and
leapt
free
in
that
moment
peter
realizing
that
another
instant
delay
might
be
fatal
pounced
forward
with
a
single
swift
swoop
and
seized
the
his
naked
hands
tessa
uttered
the
shriek
which
a
few
seconds
before
sheer
horror
had
arrested
and
fell
back
senseless
in
her
chair
peter
grim
and
awful
in
the
uncertain
light
fought
the
thing
he
had
gripped
while
a
small
monster
clawed
its
way
up
him
fiercely
clambering
to
reach
the
horrible
writhing
creature
in
the
man
hold
it
was
all
over
in
a
few
seconds
over
before
either
of
the
men
in
front
of
peter
or
a
shadowy
figure
behind
him
that
had
come
up
at
tessa
cry
could
give
any
help
with
a
low
laugh
that
was
more
terrible
than
any
uttered
curse
peter
flung
the
coiling
horror
over
the
into
the
bushes
of
the
compound
something
else
went
with
it
closely
locked
they
heard
the
thud
of
the
fall
and
there
followed
an
awful
voiceless
struggling
in
the
darkness
peter
a
voice
said
peter
was
leaning
against
a
post
of
the
verandah
missy
is
quite
safe
he
said
but
his
voice
sounded
odd
curiously
lifeless
the
shadow
that
had
approached
behind
him
swept
forward
into
the
light
the
lanterns
shone
upon
a
strange
figure
bent
clothed
in
a
long
dingy
garment
that
seemed
to
envelop
it
from
head
to
foot
peter
gave
a
violent
start
and
spoke
a
few
rapid
words
in
his
own
language
the
other
made
answer
even
more
swiftly
and
in
a
second
there
was
the
flash
of
a
knife
in
the
fitful
glare
bernard
and
tommy
both
started
forward
but
peter
only
thrust
out
one
arm
with
a
grunt
it
was
a
gesture
of
submission
and
it
told
its
own
tale
the
poor
devil
bitten
gasped
tommy
bernard
turned
to
tessa
and
lifted
the
little
limp
body
in
his
arms
he
thought
that
stella
would
follow
him
as
he
bore
the
child
into
the
room
behind
but
she
did
not
the
place
was
in
for
they
had
turned
down
the
lamps
to
see
the
fireworks
he
laid
her
upon
a
sofa
and
turned
them
up
again
the
light
upon
her
face
showed
it
pinched
and
deathly
her
breathing
seemed
to
be
suspended
he
left
her
and
went
swiftly
to
the
in
search
of
brandy
returning
with
it
he
knelt
beside
her
forcing
a
little
between
the
rigid
white
lips
his
own
mouth
was
grimly
compressed
the
sight
of
his
little
playfellow
lying
like
that
cut
him
to
the
soul
she
was
uninjured
he
knew
but
he
asked
himself
if
the
awful
fright
had
killed
her
he
had
never
seen
so
a
swoon
before
he
had
no
further
thought
for
what
was
passing
on
the
verandah
outside
tommy
had
said
that
peter
was
bitten
but
there
were
three
people
to
look
after
him
whereas
tessa
poor
brave
mite
had
only
himself
he
chafed
her
icy
cheeks
and
hands
with
a
desperate
sense
of
impotence
he
was
rewarded
after
what
seemed
to
him
an
endless
period
of
suspense
a
tinge
of
colour
came
into
the
white
lips
and
the
closed
eyelids
quivered
and
slowly
opened
the
bluebell
eyes
gazed
questioningly
into
his
where
where
is
scooter
whispered
tessa
not
far
away
dear
he
made
answer
soothingly
we
will
go
and
find
him
presently
drink
another
little
drain
of
this
first
she
obeyed
him
almost
mechanically
the
shadow
of
a
great
horror
still
lingered
in
her
eyes
he
gathered
her
closely
to
him
try
and
get
a
little
sleep
darling
i
here
i
take
care
of
you
she
snuggled
against
him
am
i
going
to
stay
all
night
she
asked
perhaps
little
one
perhaps
he
pressed
her
closer
still
quite
comfy
oh
very
comfy
ever
so
comfy
murmured
tessa
closing
her
eyes
again
dear
dear
uncle
st
bernard
she
sank
down
in
his
hold
too
spent
to
trouble
herself
any
further
and
in
a
very
few
seconds
her
quiet
breathing
told
him
that
she
was
fast
asleep
he
sat
very
still
holding
her
the
awful
peril
through
which
she
had
come
had
made
her
tenfold
more
precious
in
his
eyes
he
could
not
have
loved
her
more
tenderly
if
she
had
been
indeed
his
own
he
fell
to
dreaming
with
his
cheek
against
her
hair
chapter
vii
rustam
karin
how
long
a
time
passed
he
never
knew
it
could
not
in
actual
fact
have
been
more
than
a
few
minutes
when
a
sudden
sound
from
the
verandah
put
an
end
to
his
reverie
he
laid
the
child
back
upon
the
sofa
and
got
up
she
was
sleeping
off
the
shock
it
would
be
a
pity
to
wake
her
he
moved
noiselessly
to
the
window
as
he
did
so
a
voice
he
scarcely
recognized
a
woman
voice
spoke
tensely
hoarsely
close
to
him
tommy
stop
that
man
do
let
him
go
he
is
a
murderer
do
you
hear
he
is
the
man
who
murdered
my
husband
bernard
stepped
over
the
sill
and
closed
the
window
after
him
the
lanterns
were
still
swaying
in
the
by
their
light
he
took
in
the
group
upon
the
verandah
peter
was
sitting
bent
forward
in
the
chair
from
which
he
had
lifted
tessa
his
snowy
garments
were
deeply
stained
with
blood
beside
him
in
a
crouched
and
apelike
attitude
apparently
on
the
point
of
departure
was
the
shadowy
native
who
had
saved
his
life
tommy
still
fantastic
and
in
his
green
and
white
was
holding
a
glass
for
peter
to
drink
and
upright
before
them
all
with
accusing
arm
outstretched
her
eyes
shining
like
stars
out
of
the
shadows
stood
stella
she
turned
to
bernard
as
he
came
forward
do
let
him
escape
she
said
her
voice
deep
with
an
insistence
he
had
never
heard
in
it
before
he
escaped
last
time
and
there
may
not
be
another
chance
tommy
looked
round
sharply
leave
the
man
alone
he
said
you
know
what
you
talking
about
stella
this
affair
has
upset
you
only
old
rustam
karin
i
know
i
know
i
have
known
for
a
long
time
that
it
was
rustam
karin
who
killed
ralph
stella
voice
vibrated
on
a
strange
note
he
may
be
everard
chosen
friend
she
said
but
a
day
will
come
when
he
will
turn
upon
him
too
bernard
she
spoke
with
sudden
appeal
you
know
everything
i
have
told
you
of
this
man
surely
you
will
help
me
i
have
made
no
mistake
peter
will
corroborate
what
i
say
ask
peter
at
sound
of
his
name
peter
lifted
a
ghastly
face
and
tried
to
rise
but
tommy
swiftly
prevented
him
sit
still
peter
will
you
you
much
too
shaky
to
walk
finish
this
stuff
first
anyhow
peter
sank
back
but
there
was
entreaty
in
his
gleaming
eyes
they
had
bandaged
his
injured
arm
across
his
breast
but
with
his
free
hand
he
made
a
humble
gesture
of
submission
to
his
mistress
he
said
his
voice
low
and
urgent
he
is
a
good
man
a
holy
man
suffer
him
to
go
his
way
the
man
in
question
had
withdrawn
into
the
shadows
he
was
in
fact
beating
an
unobtrusive
retreat
towards
the
corner
of
the
bungalow
and
would
probably
have
effected
his
escape
but
for
bernard
who
moved
by
the
anguished
entreaty
in
stella
eyes
suddenly
strode
forward
and
gripped
him
by
his
tattered
garment
no
harm
in
making
inquiries
anyway
he
said
do
you
be
in
such
a
hurry
my
friend
it
wo
do
you
any
harm
to
come
back
and
give
an
account
of
yourself
that
is
if
you
are
harmless
he
pulled
the
retreating
native
unceremoniously
back
into
the
light
the
man
made
some
resistance
but
there
was
a
mastery
about
bernard
that
would
not
be
denied
hobbling
misshapen
muttering
in
his
beard
he
returned
again
peter
voice
spoke
and
there
was
a
break
in
it
as
though
he
pleaded
with
fate
itself
and
knew
it
to
be
in
vain
he
is
a
good
man
but
he
is
leprous
do
not
look
upon
him
suffer
him
to
go
possibly
the
words
might
have
had
effect
for
stella
rigidity
had
turned
to
a
violent
shivering
and
it
was
evident
that
her
strength
was
beginning
to
fail
but
in
that
moment
bernard
broke
into
an
exclamation
of
most
unwonted
anger
and
ruthlessly
seized
the
ragged
wisp
of
black
beard
that
hung
down
over
his
victim
hollow
chest
this
is
too
bad
he
burst
forth
hotly
by
heaven
it
too
bad
man
stop
this
tomfool
mummery
and
explain
yourself
the
beard
came
away
in
his
indignant
hand
the
owner
thereof
straightened
himself
up
with
a
contemptuous
gesture
till
he
reached
the
height
of
a
tall
man
the
enveloping
slipped
back
from
his
head
i
am
not
the
fool
he
said
briefly
stella
cry
rang
through
the
verandah
and
it
was
peter
who
utterly
forgetful
of
his
own
adversity
leapt
up
like
a
faithful
hound
to
protect
her
in
her
hour
of
need
the
glass
in
tommy
hand
fell
with
a
crash
tommy
himself
staggered
back
as
if
he
had
been
struck
a
blow
between
the
eyes
and
across
the
few
feet
that
divided
them
as
if
it
had
been
a
yawning
gulf
everard
monck
faced
the
woman
who
had
denounced
him
he
did
not
utter
a
word
his
eyes
met
hers
unflinching
they
were
wholly
without
anger
emotionless
inscrutable
but
there
was
something
terrible
behind
his
patience
it
was
as
if
he
had
bared
his
breast
for
her
to
strike
and
stella
stella
looked
upon
him
with
a
frozen
incredulous
horror
just
as
tessa
had
looked
upon
the
snake
upon
her
lap
only
a
little
while
before
in
the
dreadful
silence
that
hung
like
a
poisonous
vapour
upon
them
there
came
a
small
rustling
close
to
them
and
a
wicked
little
head
with
red
peering
eyes
showed
through
the
balustrade
of
the
verandah
in
a
moment
scooter
with
an
inexpressibly
evil
air
of
satisfaction
slipped
through
and
scuttled
in
a
zigzag
course
over
the
matting
in
search
of
fresh
prey
it
was
then
that
stella
spoke
her
voice
no
more
than
a
throbbing
whisper
rustam
karin
she
said
very
grimly
across
the
gulf
everard
made
answer
rustam
karin
was
removed
to
a
leper
settlement
before
you
set
foot
in
india
by
jupiter
ejaculated
tommy
no
one
else
spoke
till
slowly
with
the
gesture
of
an
old
and
stricken
woman
stella
turned
away
i
must
think
she
said
in
the
same
curious
vibrating
whisper
as
though
she
held
converse
with
herself
i
must
think
no
one
attempted
to
detain
her
it
was
as
though
an
invisible
barrier
cut
her
off
from
all
but
peter
he
followed
her
closely
forgetful
of
his
wound
forgetful
of
everything
but
her
pressing
need
with
dumb
devotion
he
went
after
her
and
they
vanished
beyond
the
flicker
of
the
bobbing
lanterns
of
the
three
men
left
none
moved
or
spoke
for
several
difficult
seconds
finally
bernard
with
an
abrupt
gesture
that
seemed
to
express
exasperation
turned
sharply
on
his
heel
and
without
a
word
the
room
in
which
he
had
left
tessa
asleep
and
fastened
the
window
behind
him
he
left
the
tangle
of
beard
on
the
matting
and
scooter
stopped
and
nosed
it
sensitively
till
everard
stooped
and
picked
it
up
that
show
being
over
he
remarked
drily
perhaps
i
may
be
allowed
to
attend
to
business
without
further
interference
tommy
gave
a
great
start
and
crunched
some
splinters
of
the
shattered
glass
under
his
heel
he
looked
at
everard
with
an
odd
challenging
light
in
his
eyes
if
you
ask
me
he
said
bluntly
i
should
say
your
business
here
is
more
urgent
than
your
business
in
the
bazaar
everard
raised
his
brows
interrogatively
and
as
if
he
had
asked
a
question
tommy
made
sternly
resolute
response
i
got
to
have
a
talk
with
you
shall
i
come
into
your
room
just
for
a
second
the
elder
man
paused
then
are
you
sure
that
is
the
wisest
thing
you
can
do
he
said
it
what
i
going
to
do
said
tommy
firmly
all
right
everard
stooped
again
picked
up
the
inquiring
scooter
and
dropped
him
into
the
box
in
which
he
had
spent
the
evening
then
without
more
words
he
turned
along
the
verandah
and
led
the
way
to
his
own
room
tommy
came
close
behind
he
was
trembling
a
little
but
his
agitation
only
seemed
to
make
him
more
determined
he
paused
a
moment
as
he
entered
the
room
behind
everard
to
shut
the
window
then
valiantly
tackled
the
hardest
task
that
had
ever
come
his
way
look
here
he
said
you
must
see
that
this
thing
ca
be
left
where
it
is
everard
threw
off
the
garment
that
encumbered
him
and
gravely
faced
his
young
yes
i
do
see
that
he
said
i
seem
to
have
exhausted
my
credit
all
round
it
decent
of
you
tommy
to
have
been
as
forbearing
as
you
have
now
what
is
it
you
want
to
know
tommy
confronted
him
uncompromisingly
i
want
to
know
the
truth
all
he
said
ca
you
stop
this
business
and
be
straight
with
me
his
tone
was
stubborn
his
attitude
almost
hostile
yet
beneath
it
all
there
ran
a
vein
of
something
that
was
very
like
entreaty
and
everard
steadily
watching
him
smiled
the
faint
grim
smile
of
the
fighter
who
sees
a
gap
in
his
enemy
defences
i
afraid
not
he
said
i
do
want
to
be
brutal
but
you
see
tommy
it
not
your
business
tommy
flinched
a
little
but
he
stood
his
ground
i
think
forgetting
he
said
that
stella
is
my
sister
it
up
to
me
to
protect
her
from
me
everard
words
came
swift
and
sharp
as
a
tommy
turned
suddenly
white
but
he
straightened
himself
with
a
gesture
that
was
not
without
dignity
if
necessary
yes
he
said
an
abrupt
silence
followed
his
words
they
stood
facing
each
other
and
the
stillness
between
them
was
such
that
they
could
hear
scooter
beyond
the
closed
window
scratching
against
his
for
freedom
it
seemed
endless
to
tommy
he
came
through
it
unfaltering
but
he
felt
physically
sick
as
if
he
had
been
struck
in
the
back
when
everard
spoke
at
last
his
hands
clenched
involuntarily
he
half
expected
violence
but
there
was
no
hint
of
anger
about
the
elder
man
he
had
himself
under
iron
control
his
face
was
in
its
composure
his
mouth
implacably
grim
thanks
for
the
warning
he
said
briefly
it
just
as
well
to
know
how
we
stand
is
that
all
you
wanted
to
say
the
dismissal
was
as
definite
as
if
he
had
actually
seized
and
thrown
him
out
of
the
room
and
yet
there
was
not
even
suppressed
wrath
in
his
speech
it
was
indifferent
remote
as
a
voice
from
the
his
eyes
looked
upon
tommy
without
interest
or
any
sort
of
warmth
as
though
he
had
been
a
total
stranger
in
that
moment
tommy
saw
that
sacred
thing
their
friendship
shattered
and
lying
in
the
dust
it
was
not
he
who
had
flung
it
there
yet
his
soul
cried
out
in
bitter
this
was
the
man
who
had
been
closer
to
him
than
a
brother
the
man
who
had
saved
him
from
disaster
physically
and
morally
watching
over
him
with
a
grim
tenderness
that
nothing
had
ever
changed
and
now
it
was
all
done
with
there
was
nothing
left
but
to
turn
and
go
but
could
he
he
stood
irresolute
biting
his
lips
held
there
by
a
force
that
seemed
outside
himself
and
it
was
everard
who
made
the
first
move
turning
from
him
as
if
he
had
ceased
to
count
and
pulling
out
a
that
he
always
carried
to
make
some
entry
tommy
stood
yet
a
moment
longer
as
if
had
it
been
possible
he
would
have
broken
through
the
barrier
between
them
even
then
but
everard
did
not
so
much
as
glance
in
his
direction
and
the
moment
passed
in
utter
silence
he
turned
and
went
out
as
he
had
entered
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
said
chapter
viii
peter
tessa
went
back
to
the
ralstons
bungalow
that
night
borne
in
arms
she
knew
very
little
about
it
for
she
scarcely
awoke
only
dimly
realizing
that
her
friend
was
at
hand
tommy
went
with
them
carrying
scooter
he
said
he
must
show
himself
at
the
club
though
bernard
suspected
this
to
be
merely
an
excuse
for
escaping
for
a
time
from
the
green
bungalow
for
it
was
evident
that
tommy
had
had
a
shock
he
himself
was
merely
angry
at
what
appeared
to
him
a
wanton
trick
too
angry
to
trust
himself
in
his
brother
company
just
then
he
regarded
it
as
no
part
of
his
business
to
attempt
to
intervene
between
everard
and
his
wife
but
his
sympathies
were
all
with
the
latter
that
she
in
some
fashion
misconstrued
the
whole
affair
he
could
not
doubt
but
he
was
by
no
means
sure
that
everard
had
not
deliberately
schemed
for
some
species
of
misunderstanding
he
had
to
serve
his
own
ends
personated
a
man
who
was
apparently
known
to
be
disreputable
and
if
he
now
received
the
credit
for
that
man
misdeeds
he
had
himself
alone
to
thank
obviously
a
mistake
had
been
made
but
it
seemed
to
him
that
everard
had
intended
it
to
be
made
had
even
worked
to
bring
it
about
what
his
object
had
been
bernard
could
not
bring
to
conjecture
but
his
instinctive
inborn
hatred
of
all
underhand
dealings
made
him
resent
his
brother
behaviour
with
all
the
force
at
his
command
he
was
too
angry
to
attempt
to
unravel
the
mystery
and
he
did
not
broach
the
subject
to
tommy
who
evidently
desired
to
avoid
it
the
whole
business
was
beyond
his
comprehension
and
he
was
convinced
beyond
stella
also
he
did
not
think
everard
would
find
it
a
very
easy
task
to
restore
her
confidence
perhaps
he
would
not
attempt
to
do
so
perhaps
he
was
too
engrossed
with
the
service
of
his
goddess
to
care
that
he
and
his
wife
should
drift
asunder
and
yet
the
memory
of
the
morning
on
which
he
had
first
seen
those
streaks
of
grey
in
his
brother
hair
came
upon
him
and
an
unwilling
sensation
of
pity
softened
his
severity
perhaps
he
had
been
drawn
in
in
spite
of
himself
perhaps
the
poor
beggar
was
a
victim
rather
than
a
worshipper
most
certainly
whatever
his
faults
he
cared
deeply
would
he
be
able
to
make
stella
realize
that
bernard
wondered
and
shook
his
head
in
doubt
the
thought
of
stella
turning
away
with
that
look
of
frozen
horror
on
her
face
pursued
him
through
the
night
poor
girl
she
had
looked
as
though
the
end
of
all
things
had
come
for
her
could
he
have
helped
her
ought
he
to
have
left
her
so
he
quickened
his
pace
almost
insensibly
no
he
would
not
interfere
of
his
own
free
will
but
if
she
needed
his
support
if
she
counted
upon
him
he
would
not
be
found
wanting
it
might
even
be
given
to
him
eventually
to
help
them
both
he
had
not
seen
her
again
she
had
gone
to
her
room
with
peter
in
attendance
peter
who
owed
his
life
to
the
knife
in
everard
girdle
he
had
had
a
strong
feeling
that
peter
was
the
only
friend
she
needed
just
then
and
certainly
tessa
had
been
his
first
responsibility
but
the
feeling
that
possibly
she
might
need
him
was
growing
upon
him
he
wished
he
had
satisfied
himself
before
starting
that
this
was
not
the
case
but
he
comforted
himself
with
the
thought
of
peter
he
was
sure
that
peter
would
take
care
of
her
yes
peter
would
care
for
his
beloved
whatever
his
physical
disabilities
he
would
never
fail
in
the
execution
of
that
his
sacred
duty
while
the
power
to
do
so
was
his
if
all
others
failed
her
yet
would
peter
remain
faithful
even
then
with
his
devotion
was
he
crouched
upon
her
threshold
his
dark
face
wrapped
in
his
garment
yet
alert
for
every
sound
and
mournfully
aware
that
his
mistress
was
not
resting
of
his
own
wound
he
thought
not
at
all
he
had
been
very
near
the
gate
of
death
and
the
only
man
in
the
world
for
whom
he
entertained
the
smallest
feeling
of
fear
had
snatched
him
back
to
his
promptitude
alone
did
peter
owe
his
life
he
had
cut
out
that
deadly
bite
with
a
swiftness
and
a
precision
that
had
removed
all
danger
of
and
in
so
doing
he
had
exposed
the
secret
which
he
had
guarded
so
long
and
so
carefully
the
first
moment
of
contact
had
betrayed
him
to
peter
but
peter
was
very
loyal
had
he
been
the
only
one
to
recognize
him
the
secret
would
have
been
safe
he
had
done
his
best
to
guard
it
but
fate
had
been
against
them
and
the
the
had
turned
and
gone
away
as
one
peter
yearned
to
comfort
her
but
the
whole
situation
was
beyond
him
he
could
only
mount
guard
in
silence
perhaps
presently
the
great
himself
would
come
and
make
all
things
right
again
the
night
was
advancing
surely
he
would
come
soon
barely
had
he
begun
to
hope
for
this
when
the
door
he
guarded
was
opened
slightly
from
within
his
strangely
white
and
still
looked
forth
peter
she
said
gently
he
was
up
in
a
moment
bending
before
her
his
black
eyes
glowing
in
the
dim
light
she
laid
her
slender
hand
upon
his
shoulder
she
had
ever
treated
him
with
the
graciousness
of
a
queen
how
is
your
wound
she
asked
him
in
her
soft
low
voice
has
it
been
properly
bathed
and
dressed
he
straightened
himself
looking
into
her
beautiful
pale
face
with
the
loving
reverence
that
he
always
accorded
her
all
is
well
my
he
said
will
you
not
be
graciously
pleased
to
rest
she
shook
her
head
smiling
faintly
a
smile
that
somehow
tore
his
heart
she
opened
her
door
and
motioned
him
to
enter
i
think
i
had
better
see
for
myself
she
said
poor
peter
how
you
must
have
suffered
and
how
splendidly
brave
you
are
come
in
and
let
me
see
what
i
can
do
he
hung
back
protesting
but
she
would
take
no
refusal
gently
but
firmly
overruling
all
his
scruples
why
was
the
doctor
not
sent
for
she
said
i
ought
to
have
thought
of
it
myself
she
insisted
upon
washing
and
bandaging
his
wound
anew
it
was
a
deep
one
necessity
had
been
stern
and
everard
had
not
spared
it
had
bled
freely
and
there
was
no
sign
of
any
poisonous
swelling
with
tender
hands
stella
treated
it
peter
standing
dumbly
submissive
the
while
when
she
had
finished
she
arranged
the
injured
arm
in
a
sling
and
looked
him
in
the
eyes
peter
where
is
the
captain
he
went
to
his
room
my
said
peter
bernard
carried
the
little
missy
back
and
denvers
went
with
him
i
did
not
see
the
captain
again
he
spoke
wistfully
as
one
who
longed
to
help
but
recognized
his
limitations
stella
received
his
news
in
silence
her
face
still
and
white
as
the
face
of
a
marble
statue
she
felt
no
resentment
against
peter
he
had
acted
almost
under
compulsion
but
she
could
not
discuss
the
matter
with
him
at
length
you
may
go
peter
she
said
please
let
no
one
come
to
my
door
i
wish
to
be
undisturbed
peter
salaamed
low
and
withdrew
the
order
was
a
very
definite
one
and
she
knew
she
could
rely
upon
him
to
carry
it
out
as
the
door
closed
softly
upon
him
she
turned
towards
her
window
it
opened
upon
the
verandah
she
moved
across
the
room
to
shut
it
but
ere
she
reached
it
everard
monck
came
noiselessly
through
on
slippered
feet
and
bolted
it
behind
him
chapter
ix
the
consuming
fire
as
he
turned
towards
her
there
came
upon
stella
swift
as
a
stab
through
the
heart
the
memory
of
that
terrible
night
more
than
a
year
before
when
he
had
drawn
her
into
his
room
and
fastened
the
window
behind
her
against
whom
his
wild
words
rushed
upon
her
she
had
deemed
them
to
be
directed
against
the
unknown
intruder
on
the
verandah
she
knew
now
that
the
madness
that
had
loosed
his
tongue
had
moved
him
to
utter
his
fierce
threat
against
a
man
who
was
dead
against
the
man
whom
he
had
she
stopped
the
thought
as
she
would
have
checked
the
word
she
turned
shivering
away
the
man
on
the
verandah
that
vision
of
the
she
saw
it
all
now
she
saw
it
all
and
he
had
loved
her
before
her
marriage
and
he
had
known
and
he
had
known
that
given
opportunity
he
could
win
her
for
his
own
like
a
throbbing
undersong
the
fiendish
accompaniment
to
the
chorus
the
gossip
of
the
station
as
detailed
by
tessa
ran
with
glib
mockery
through
her
brain
ah
they
only
suspected
but
she
knew
she
knew
the
door
of
that
secret
chamber
had
opened
wide
to
her
at
last
and
perforce
she
had
entered
in
he
had
moved
forward
but
he
had
not
spoken
at
least
she
fancied
not
but
all
her
senses
were
in
an
uproar
and
above
it
all
she
seemed
to
hear
that
dreadful
little
thrumming
instrument
down
by
the
river
at
udalkhand
the
tinkling
mystic
call
of
the
vampire
goddess
india
the
insatiable
who
had
made
him
what
he
was
he
came
to
her
and
every
fibre
of
her
being
was
aware
of
him
and
thrilled
at
his
coming
never
had
she
loved
him
as
she
loved
him
then
but
her
love
was
a
fiery
torment
that
burned
and
consumed
her
soul
she
seemed
to
feel
it
blistering
shrivelling
in
the
cruel
heat
almost
before
she
knew
it
she
had
broken
her
silence
speaking
as
it
were
in
spite
of
herself
scarcely
knowing
in
her
anguish
what
she
said
yes
i
know
i
know
what
you
are
going
to
say
you
are
going
to
tell
me
that
i
belong
to
you
and
of
course
it
is
true
i
do
but
if
i
stay
with
you
i
shall
be
a
murderess
nothing
will
alter
that
stella
he
said
his
voice
was
stern
so
stern
that
she
flinched
he
laid
his
hand
upon
her
and
she
shrank
as
she
would
have
shrunk
from
a
hot
iron
searing
her
flesh
she
had
a
wild
thought
that
she
would
bear
the
brand
of
it
for
ever
stella
he
said
again
and
in
both
tone
and
action
there
was
compulsion
i
have
come
to
tell
you
that
you
are
making
a
mistake
i
am
innocent
of
this
thing
you
suspect
me
of
she
stood
unresisting
in
his
hold
but
she
was
shaking
all
over
the
floor
seemed
to
be
rising
and
falling
under
her
feet
she
knew
that
her
lips
moved
several
times
before
she
could
make
them
speak
but
i
do
suspect
she
said
the
others
suspect
i
know
he
received
her
words
in
silence
she
saw
his
face
as
through
a
shifting
vapour
very
pale
very
determined
with
eyes
of
terrible
intensity
dominating
her
own
half
mechanically
she
repeated
herself
it
was
as
if
that
devilish
thrumming
in
her
brain
compelled
her
the
others
suspect
i
know
i
see
he
said
at
last
and
nothing
i
can
say
will
make
any
difference
oh
no
she
made
answer
and
scarcely
knew
that
she
spoke
so
cold
and
numb
had
she
become
how
could
it
now
he
looked
at
her
and
suddenly
he
saw
that
to
which
his
own
suffering
had
momentarily
blinded
him
he
saw
her
utter
weakness
with
a
swif
passionate
movement
he
caught
her
to
him
for
a
second
or
two
he
held
her
so
strained
against
his
heart
then
almost
fiercely
he
turned
her
face
up
to
his
own
and
kissed
the
stiff
white
lips
be
it
so
then
he
said
and
in
his
voice
was
a
deep
note
as
though
he
challenged
all
the
powers
of
evil
you
are
mine
and
mine
you
will
remain
she
did
not
resist
him
though
the
touch
of
his
lips
was
terrible
to
her
only
as
they
left
her
own
she
turned
her
face
aside
very
strangely
that
savage
lapse
of
his
had
given
her
strength
physically
perhaps
but
only
for
a
little
while
she
said
gaspingly
and
in
spirit
never
never
again
what
do
you
mean
he
said
his
arms
tightening
about
her
she
kept
her
face
averted
i
mean
that
some
forms
of
torture
are
worse
than
death
if
it
comes
to
that
if
you
compel
me
i
shall
choose
death
stella
he
let
her
go
so
suddenly
that
she
nearly
fell
the
utterance
of
her
name
was
as
a
cry
wrung
from
him
by
sheer
agony
he
turned
from
her
with
his
hands
over
his
face
my
god
he
said
and
again
almost
inarticulately
my
god
the
low
utterance
pierced
her
yet
she
stood
motionless
her
hands
gripped
hard
together
he
had
forced
the
words
from
her
and
they
were
past
recall
nor
would
she
have
recalled
them
had
she
been
able
for
it
seemed
to
her
that
her
love
had
become
an
evil
thing
and
her
whole
being
shrank
from
it
in
a
species
of
horrified
abhorrence
even
though
she
could
not
cast
it
out
he
had
turned
towards
the
window
and
she
watched
him
her
heart
beating
in
slow
hard
strokes
with
a
sound
like
a
distant
drum
would
he
go
would
he
remain
she
almost
prayed
aloud
that
he
would
go
but
he
did
not
very
suddenly
he
turned
and
strode
back
to
her
there
was
purpose
in
every
line
of
him
but
there
was
no
longer
any
violence
he
halted
before
her
stella
he
said
and
his
voice
was
perfectly
steady
and
controlled
do
you
think
you
are
being
altogether
fair
to
me
she
wrung
her
clasped
hands
she
could
not
answer
him
he
took
them
into
his
own
very
quietly
just
look
me
in
the
face
for
a
minute
he
said
she
yearned
to
disobey
but
she
could
not
dumbly
she
raised
her
eyes
to
his
he
waited
a
moment
very
still
and
composed
then
he
spoke
stella
i
swear
to
you
and
i
call
god
to
witness
that
i
did
not
kill
ralph
dacre
a
dreadful
shiver
went
through
her
at
the
bald
brief
words
she
felt
as
tommy
had
felt
a
little
earlier
physically
sick
the
beating
of
her
heart
was
getting
slower
and
slower
she
wondered
if
presently
it
would
stop
do
you
believe
me
he
said
still
holding
her
eyes
with
his
still
clasping
her
icy
hands
firmly
between
his
own
she
forced
herself
to
speak
before
that
horrible
sense
of
nausea
overcame
her
perhaps
david
said
the
same
thing
about
uriah
the
hittite
his
face
changed
a
little
but
it
was
a
change
she
could
not
have
defined
his
eyes
remained
inscrutably
fixed
upon
hers
they
seemed
to
enchain
her
quivering
soul
no
he
said
quietly
nor
did
i
employ
any
one
else
to
do
it
but
you
were
there
the
words
seemed
suddenly
to
burst
from
her
without
her
own
volition
he
drew
back
sharply
as
if
he
had
been
struck
but
he
kept
his
eyes
upon
hers
i
ca
explain
anything
he
said
i
am
not
here
to
explain
i
only
came
to
see
if
your
love
was
great
enough
to
make
you
believe
in
me
in
spite
of
all
there
seems
to
be
against
me
is
it
stella
is
it
his
words
seemed
to
go
through
her
tearing
a
way
to
her
heart
the
agony
was
more
than
she
could
bear
she
uttered
an
anguished
cry
and
wrenched
herself
from
him
it
is
a
question
of
love
she
said
you
know
it
is
a
question
of
love
i
never
wanted
to
love
you
i
never
wholly
trusted
you
but
you
forced
my
love
though
you
could
compel
my
trust
and
now
that
i
know
now
that
i
know
her
voice
broke
as
if
the
torture
were
too
great
for
her
she
flung
out
her
hands
with
a
gesture
of
driving
him
from
her
oh
it
is
hell
on
earth
hell
on
earth
he
drew
back
for
a
second
before
her
his
face
deathly
white
and
then
suddenly
an
awful
light
leapt
in
his
eyes
he
gripped
her
outflung
hands
the
fire
had
kindled
to
a
flame
and
the
torture
was
too
much
for
him
also
then
you
shall
love
me
even
in
hell
he
said
through
his
clenched
teeth
and
locked
her
in
the
iron
circle
of
his
arms
she
did
not
resist
him
she
was
very
near
the
end
of
her
strength
only
as
he
held
her
her
eyes
met
his
mutely
imploring
him
it
reached
him
even
in
his
madness
that
unspoken
appeal
it
checked
him
in
the
of
his
passion
his
hold
relaxed
as
if
at
a
word
of
command
he
put
her
into
a
chair
and
turned
himself
from
her
the
next
moment
he
was
fumbling
desperately
at
the
window
fastening
the
night
met
him
on
the
threshold
he
heard
her
weeping
piteously
hopelessly
as
he
went
away
chapter
x
the
desert
place
a
single
light
shone
across
the
verandah
when
bernard
monck
returned
late
in
the
night
it
drew
his
steps
though
it
did
not
come
from
any
of
the
with
the
light
tread
often
characteristic
of
heavy
men
he
approached
it
realizing
only
at
the
last
moment
that
it
came
from
the
window
of
his
brother
room
then
for
a
second
he
hesitated
he
was
angry
with
everard
more
angry
than
he
could
remember
that
he
had
ever
been
before
he
questioned
with
himself
as
to
the
wisdom
of
seeing
him
again
that
night
he
doubted
if
he
could
be
ordinarily
civil
to
him
at
present
and
a
quarrel
would
help
no
one
still
why
was
the
fellow
burning
a
light
at
that
hour
an
unacknowledged
uneasiness
took
possession
of
him
and
drove
him
forward
people
seemed
to
do
all
manner
of
extravagant
things
in
this
fantastic
country
that
they
would
never
have
dreamed
of
doing
in
homely
old
england
there
must
be
something
electric
in
the
atmosphere
that
penetrated
the
veins
even
he
had
been
aware
of
it
now
and
then
a
strange
and
potent
influence
that
drove
a
man
to
passionate
deeds
he
reached
the
window
without
sound
just
as
stella
had
reached
it
on
that
night
of
rain
long
ago
with
no
consciousness
of
spying
driven
by
an
urgent
impulse
he
could
not
stop
to
question
he
looked
in
the
window
was
ajar
as
if
it
had
been
pushed
to
negligently
by
someone
entering
and
in
a
flash
bernard
had
it
wide
he
went
in
as
though
he
had
been
propelled
a
man
everard
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
he
was
facing
the
window
and
the
light
shone
with
ghastly
distinctness
upon
his
face
but
he
did
not
look
up
he
was
gazing
fixedly
into
a
glass
of
water
he
held
in
his
hand
apparently
watching
some
minute
substance
melting
there
it
was
not
the
thing
he
held
but
the
look
upon
his
face
that
sent
bernard
forward
with
a
spring
man
he
burst
forth
what
are
you
doing
everard
gave
utterance
to
a
fierce
oath
that
was
more
like
the
cry
of
a
savage
animal
than
the
articulate
speech
of
a
man
he
stepped
back
sharply
and
put
the
glass
to
his
lips
but
no
drop
that
it
contained
did
he
swallow
for
in
the
same
instant
bernard
flung
it
violently
aside
the
glass
spun
across
the
room
and
they
grappled
together
for
the
mastery
for
a
few
seconds
the
battle
was
hot
then
very
suddenly
the
elder
man
threw
up
his
hands
all
right
he
said
between
short
gasps
for
breath
you
can
hammer
me
if
you
want
someone
to
hammer
perhaps
it
do
you
good
he
was
free
on
the
instant
everard
flung
round
and
turned
his
back
he
did
not
speak
but
crossed
the
room
and
picked
up
the
glass
which
lay
unbroken
on
the
floor
bernard
followed
him
still
gasping
for
breath
give
that
to
me
he
said
his
soft
voice
was
oddly
stern
everard
looked
at
him
his
hand
shaking
a
little
was
extended
after
a
very
definite
pause
he
placed
the
glass
within
it
there
was
a
little
white
sediment
left
with
a
drain
of
water
at
the
bottom
with
his
blue
eyes
full
upon
his
brother
face
bernard
lifted
it
to
his
own
lips
but
the
next
instant
it
was
dashed
away
and
the
glass
shivered
to
atoms
against
the
wall
you
fool
everard
said
a
faint
faint
smile
that
very
strangely
proclaimed
a
resemblance
between
them
which
was
very
seldom
perceptible
crossed
bernard
face
i
thought
so
he
said
now
look
here
boy
let
stop
being
melodramatic
for
a
bit
take
a
dose
of
quinine
instead
it
seems
to
be
the
panacea
for
all
evils
in
this
curious
country
his
voice
was
perfectly
kind
even
persusaive
but
it
carried
a
hint
of
authority
as
well
and
everard
gave
him
a
keen
look
as
if
aware
of
it
he
was
very
pale
but
absolutely
steady
as
he
made
reply
i
do
think
quinine
will
meet
the
case
on
this
occasion
you
prefer
another
kind
of
medicine
bernard
suggested
and
then
with
sudden
feeling
he
held
out
his
hand
everard
old
chap
never
do
that
while
you
a
single
friend
left
in
the
world
do
you
want
to
break
my
heart
i
only
ask
to
stand
by
you
i
stand
by
you
to
the
very
gates
of
hell
do
you
know
that
his
voice
trembled
slightly
everard
turned
and
gripped
the
proffered
hand
hard
in
his
own
i
suppose
i
might
have
known
he
said
but
it
a
bit
rash
of
you
all
the
same
his
own
voice
quivered
though
he
forced
a
smile
he
would
have
turned
away
but
bernard
restrained
him
i
do
care
a
tinker
damn
what
you
done
he
said
forcibly
remember
that
we
brothers
and
i
stick
to
you
if
anything
in
life
that
i
can
do
to
help
i
do
it
if
there
is
well
i
wo
worry
you
but
you
know
you
can
count
on
me
just
the
same
you
never
stand
alone
while
i
live
it
was
generously
spoken
the
words
came
straight
from
his
soul
he
put
his
hand
on
his
brother
shoulder
as
he
uttered
them
his
eyes
were
as
tender
as
the
eyes
of
a
woman
and
suddenly
without
warning
everard
strength
failed
him
it
was
like
the
snapping
of
a
stretched
wire
oh
man
he
said
and
covered
his
face
bernard
arm
was
round
him
in
a
moment
a
staunch
upholding
arm
everard
dear
old
chap
ca
you
tell
me
what
it
is
he
said
god
knows
i
die
sooner
than
let
you
down
everard
did
not
answer
his
breathing
was
hard
spasmodic
intensely
painful
to
hear
he
had
the
look
of
a
man
stricken
in
his
pride
for
a
space
bernard
stood
dumbly
supporting
him
then
at
length
very
quietly
he
moved
and
guided
him
to
a
chair
take
your
time
he
said
gently
sit
down
mutely
everard
submitted
the
agony
of
that
night
had
stripped
his
manhood
of
its
reserve
he
sat
crouched
his
head
bowed
upon
his
clenched
hands
wait
while
i
fetch
you
a
drink
bernard
said
he
was
gone
barely
two
minutes
returning
he
fastened
the
window
and
drew
the
curtain
across
then
he
bent
again
over
the
huddled
figure
in
the
chair
take
a
mouthful
of
this
old
fellow
it
pull
you
together
everard
groped
outwards
with
a
quivering
hand
give
me
strength
to
shoot
myself
he
muttered
the
words
were
only
just
audible
but
bernard
caught
them
no
give
you
strength
to
play
the
game
he
said
and
held
the
glass
he
had
brought
to
his
brother
lips
everard
drank
with
closed
eyes
and
sat
forward
again
motionless
his
face
was
bloodless
i
sorry
bernard
he
said
after
a
moment
forgive
me
for
manhandling
you
and
all
the
rest
if
you
can
he
drew
a
long
hard
breath
thanks
for
everything
but
i
not
leaving
you
said
bernard
gently
not
like
this
like
what
everard
opened
his
eyes
with
an
abrupt
effort
oh
i
all
right
do
you
bother
about
me
he
said
their
eyes
met
for
a
second
longer
bernard
stood
over
him
then
he
went
down
upon
his
knees
by
his
side
i
swear
i
wo
leave
you
he
said
until
you
told
me
this
trouble
of
yours
everard
shook
his
head
instantly
but
his
hand
went
out
and
closed
upon
the
arm
that
had
upheld
him
he
was
beginning
to
recover
his
habitual
it
no
good
old
chap
i
ca
he
said
and
added
almost
involuntarily
that
the
hell
of
it
but
you
can
bernard
said
he
still
looked
him
straight
in
the
eyes
you
can
and
you
will
call
it
a
confession
i
heard
a
good
many
in
my
time
and
tell
me
everything
confess
to
you
a
hint
of
surprise
showed
in
everard
heavy
eyes
you
better
not
tempt
me
to
do
that
he
said
you
might
be
sorry
afterwards
i
will
risk
it
bernard
said
risk
being
made
an
accessory
to
what
you
may
regard
as
a
crime
everard
said
forgive
me
you
a
parson
i
know
but
are
you
sure
you
can
play
the
part
bernard
smiled
a
little
at
the
question
yes
i
can
he
said
a
confession
is
sacred
whatever
it
is
and
i
swear
to
you
by
god
in
heaven
to
treat
it
as
such
everard
was
looking
at
him
fixedly
but
something
of
the
strain
went
out
of
his
look
at
the
words
a
gleam
of
relief
crossed
his
face
all
right
i
will
confess
to
you
he
said
but
i
warn
you
beforehand
you
be
horribly
shocked
and
you
wo
feel
like
absolving
me
afterwards
that
not
my
job
dear
fellow
bernard
answered
gently
go
ahead
you
sure
of
my
sympathy
anyway
am
i
you
a
good
chap
bernard
look
here
do
kneel
there
it
not
suitable
for
a
father
confessor
everard
faint
smile
showed
for
a
moment
bernard
hand
closed
upon
his
go
ahead
he
said
again
i
all
right
everard
made
an
abrupt
gesture
that
had
in
it
something
of
surrender
it
soon
told
he
said
though
i
do
know
why
i
should
burden
you
with
it
that
fellow
ralph
dacre
i
did
murder
him
i
wish
to
heaven
i
had
so
far
as
i
know
he
is
alive
ah
bernard
said
jerkily
with
obvious
effort
everard
continued
i
a
murderous
brute
no
doubt
but
if
i
had
the
chance
to
kill
him
now
i
take
it
you
see
what
it
means
do
you
it
means
that
stella
that
stella
he
broke
off
with
a
convulsive
movement
and
dropped
back
into
a
tortured
silence
yes
i
see
what
it
means
bernard
said
after
an
interval
everard
forced
out
a
few
more
words
about
a
fortnight
after
their
marriage
i
got
your
letter
telling
me
he
had
a
wife
living
i
went
straight
after
them
in
native
disguise
and
made
him
clear
out
that
the
whole
story
i
see
bernard
said
again
again
there
fell
a
silence
between
them
everard
sat
bowed
his
head
on
his
hand
the
awful
pallor
was
passing
but
the
stricken
look
remained
bernard
spoke
at
last
you
have
no
idea
what
became
of
him
not
the
faintest
he
went
that
was
all
that
concerned
me
grimly
without
lifting
his
head
he
made
answer
you
know
the
rest
or
you
can
guess
then
you
came
and
told
me
that
the
woman
dacre
wife
died
before
his
marriage
to
stella
i
been
in
hell
ever
since
i
wish
to
heaven
i
stopped
away
bernard
exclaimed
with
sudden
vehemence
everard
shifted
his
position
slightly
to
glance
at
him
do
wish
that
he
said
after
all
it
would
probably
have
come
out
somehow
and
stella
bernard
spoke
with
hesitation
as
if
uncertain
of
his
ground
what
does
she
think
how
much
does
she
know
she
thinks
like
the
rest
she
thinks
i
murdered
the
hound
and
rather
she
thought
that
there
was
dogged
suffering
in
voice
than
suspected
the
truth
you
think
bernard
still
spoke
with
slight
hesitation
that
will
hurt
her
less
yes
there
was
stubborn
conviction
in
the
reply
everard
slowly
straightened
himself
and
faced
his
brother
squarely
there
is
the
child
he
said
bernard
shook
his
head
slightly
you
wrong
old
fellow
making
a
mistake
you
are
choosing
the
hardest
course
for
her
as
well
as
yourself
everard
jaw
hardened
i
shall
find
a
way
out
for
myself
he
said
she
shall
be
left
in
peace
what
do
you
mean
bernard
said
then
as
he
made
no
reply
he
took
him
firmly
by
the
shoulders
no
no
you
wo
you
wo
he
said
that
not
you
my
boy
not
when
you
sanely
thought
it
out
everard
suffered
his
hold
but
his
face
remained
set
in
grim
lines
there
is
no
other
way
he
said
honestly
i
see
no
other
way
there
is
another
way
very
steadily
with
the
utmost
confidence
bernard
made
the
assertion
there
always
is
god
sees
to
that
find
it
presently
everard
smiled
very
wearily
at
the
words
i
given
up
expecting
any
light
from
that
quarter
he
said
it
seems
to
me
that
he
has
much
use
for
the
wanderers
once
they
get
off
the
beaten
track
oh
my
dear
chap
bernard
hands
pressed
upon
him
suddenly
do
you
really
believe
he
has
no
care
for
that
which
is
lost
have
you
blundered
along
all
this
time
and
never
yet
seen
the
lamp
in
the
desert
you
will
see
it
like
every
other
wanderer
sooner
or
later
if
you
only
have
the
pluck
to
keep
on
you
seem
mighty
sure
of
that
everard
looked
at
him
with
a
species
of
dull
curiosity
are
you
sure
of
course
i
am
sure
bernard
spoke
vigorously
and
so
are
you
in
your
heart
you
know
very
well
that
if
you
only
push
on
you
wo
be
left
to
die
in
the
wilderness
have
you
never
thought
to
yourself
after
a
particularly
dark
spell
that
there
has
always
been
a
speck
of
light
somewhere
never
total
darkness
for
any
length
of
time
that
the
lamp
in
the
desert
old
chap
and
whether
you
realize
it
or
not
god
put
it
there
he
ceased
to
speak
and
rose
quietly
to
his
feet
then
as
everard
stretched
a
hand
to
him
gave
him
a
steady
pull
upwards
they
stood
face
to
face
and
that
bernard
added
after
a
few
moments
is
all
i
got
to
say
you
turn
in
now
and
get
a
rest
if
you
want
me
well
you
know
where
to
find
me
just
any
time
thanks
everard
said
his
hand
held
his
brother
hard
but
before
you
go
there
one
thing
i
want
to
say
no
two
a
shadowy
smile
touched
his
grim
lips
and
vanished
his
eyes
were
still
and
wholly
remote
sheltering
his
soul
go
ahead
said
bernard
gently
everard
paused
for
a
second
you
have
asked
no
promise
of
me
he
said
then
but
i
make
you
one
and
i
want
one
from
you
in
return
again
he
paused
as
if
he
had
some
difficulty
in
finding
words
you
can
rely
on
me
bernard
said
yes
old
fellow
for
an
instant
his
eyes
smiled
also
i
know
it
by
that
fact
alone
that
you
gained
your
point
and
so
i
hang
on
somehow
for
the
present
find
another
way
anyhow
hang
on
just
because
you
are
what
you
are
and
because
his
voice
sank
a
little
you
care
do
you
know
i
love
you
before
any
one
else
in
the
world
bernard
said
giving
him
a
mighty
grip
yes
everard
looked
him
straight
in
the
face
i
do
and
it
means
more
to
me
than
perhaps
you
think
in
fact
it
everything
to
me
just
now
that
why
i
want
you
to
promise
me
whatever
happens
whatever
i
decide
to
do
that
you
will
stay
within
reach
of
that
you
will
take
care
of
my
my
of
stella
he
ended
abruptly
with
a
quick
gesture
that
held
entreaty
and
bernard
reply
came
instantly
almost
before
he
had
ceased
to
speak
before
god
old
chap
i
will
thanks
everard
said
again
he
stood
for
a
few
moments
as
if
debating
something
further
but
in
the
end
he
freed
himself
and
turned
away
she
will
be
all
right
with
you
he
said
you
safe
anyhow
quite
safe
said
bernard
steadily
part
v
chapter
i
greater
than
death
if
you
ask
me
said
bertie
oakes
propping
himself
up
in
an
elegant
attitude
against
a
pillar
of
the
club
verandah
it
my
belief
that
there
going
to
be
a
nobody
did
ask
you
observed
tommy
rudely
he
generally
was
rude
nowadays
and
had
been
haled
before
a
only
the
previous
evening
for
that
very
reason
the
sentence
passed
had
been
of
a
somewhat
drastic
nature
and
certainly
had
not
improved
his
temper
or
his
manners
to
be
stripped
bound
scientifically
and
dipped
in
the
club
till
as
oakes
put
it
all
the
venom
had
been
drenched
out
of
him
was
an
experience
for
which
only
one
utterly
reckless
would
qualify
twice
tommy
had
come
through
it
with
a
dumb
endurance
which
had
somewhat
spoilt
the
occasion
for
his
tormentors
had
gone
back
to
the
green
bungalow
as
soon
as
his
punishment
was
over
and
for
the
first
time
had
drunk
heavily
in
the
privacy
of
his
room
he
sat
now
in
a
huddled
position
on
the
club
verandah
looking
like
a
sick
chimpanzee
as
oakes
assured
him
ready
to
bite
if
he
dared
at
a
moment
notice
ralston
was
seated
near
she
had
a
motherly
eye
upon
tommy
now
what
exactly
do
you
mean
by
a
mr
oakes
she
asked
with
her
gentle
smile
oakes
blew
a
cloud
of
smoke
upwards
he
liked
airing
his
opinions
especially
when
there
were
several
ladies
within
earshot
what
do
i
mean
he
said
with
a
pomposity
carefully
moulded
upon
the
colonel
mode
of
delivery
on
a
i
mean
my
dear
ralston
that
which
would
have
to
be
suppressed
a
rising
among
the
native
element
of
the
state
ape
growled
tommy
under
his
breath
oakes
caught
the
growl
and
made
a
downward
motion
with
his
thumb
which
only
tommy
understood
burton
soft
false
laugh
filled
the
pause
that
followed
his
pronouncement
surely
no
one
could
openly
object
to
the
conviction
of
a
native
murderer
she
said
i
hear
that
the
evidence
is
quite
conclusive
captain
monck
has
spared
no
pains
in
that
direction
captain
monck
observed
lady
harriet
elevating
her
long
nose
seems
to
be
exceptionally
well
qualified
for
that
kind
of
service
set
a
thief
to
catch
a
thief
what
suggested
oakes
lightly
yes
he
seems
to
be
quite
good
at
it
just
as
well
in
a
way
perhaps
someone
has
got
to
do
the
dirty
work
though
it
would
be
preferable
for
all
of
us
if
he
were
a
policeman
by
profession
it
was
too
carelessly
spoken
to
sound
actively
malevolent
but
tommy
with
his
arms
gripped
round
his
knees
raised
eyes
of
bloodshot
fury
to
the
speaker
face
if
any
one
could
take
a
first
class
certificate
for
dirty
work
it
would
be
you
he
said
speaking
very
distinctly
between
clenched
teeth
a
sudden
silence
fell
upon
the
assembly
oakes
looked
down
at
tommy
and
tommy
glared
up
at
oakes
then
abruptly
major
ralston
who
had
been
standing
in
the
background
with
a
tall
drink
in
his
hand
slouched
forward
and
let
himself
down
ponderously
on
the
edge
of
the
verandah
by
tommy
side
go
away
bertie
he
said
we
listened
to
your
wind
instrument
long
enough
tommy
you
shut
up
or
i
give
you
the
beastliest
physic
i
know
what
were
we
talking
about
mary
give
us
a
lead
he
appealed
to
his
wife
who
glanced
towards
lady
harriet
with
a
hint
of
embarrassment
major
ralston
at
once
addressed
himself
to
her
he
was
never
embarrassed
by
any
one
and
never
went
out
of
his
way
to
be
pleasant
without
good
reason
this
murder
trial
is
going
to
be
sensational
he
said
i
just
got
back
from
giving
evidence
as
to
the
cause
of
death
and
i
have
it
on
good
authority
that
a
certain
august
personage
in
markestan
is
shaking
in
his
shoes
as
to
the
result
of
the
business
i
have
heard
that
too
said
lady
harriet
it
was
a
curious
fact
that
though
she
was
always
ready
and
would
even
go
out
of
her
way
to
snub
the
surgeon
wife
she
had
never
once
been
other
than
gracious
to
the
surgeon
i
do
suppose
he
will
be
actively
implicated
he
too
wily
for
that
went
on
major
ralston
but
there
not
much
doubt
according
to
barnes
that
he
was
in
the
know
very
much
so
i
should
imagine
he
glanced
about
him
ermsted
is
here
is
she
no
dear
i
left
her
resting
his
wife
said
this
affair
is
very
trying
for
her
naturally
he
assented
somewhat
grimly
i
wonder
she
stayed
for
it
now
tessa
on
the
other
hand
yearns
for
the
head
in
a
charger
that
child
is
getting
too
eastern
in
her
ideas
it
will
be
a
good
thing
to
get
her
home
burton
intervened
with
a
simper
yes
she
really
is
a
naughty
little
thing
and
i
can
not
say
i
shall
be
sorry
when
she
is
gone
my
small
son
is
at
such
a
very
receptive
age
yes
he
old
enough
to
go
to
school
and
be
licked
into
shape
said
major
ralston
brutally
he
flings
stones
at
my
car
every
time
i
pass
i
shall
stop
and
give
him
a
licking
myself
some
day
when
i
have
time
really
major
ralston
i
hope
you
will
not
do
anything
so
cruel
protested
burton
we
never
correct
him
in
that
way
ourselves
pity
you
do
said
major
ralston
an
unlicked
cub
is
an
insult
to
creation
give
him
to
me
for
a
little
while
i
undertake
to
improve
him
both
morally
and
physically
to
such
an
extent
that
you
wo
know
him
here
tommy
uttered
a
brief
wholly
involuntary
guffaw
what
the
matter
with
you
said
ralston
nothing
his
gloom
dropped
upon
him
again
like
a
mantle
have
you
been
at
khanmulla
all
day
yes
a
confounded
waste
of
time
it
been
too
ralston
took
a
deep
drink
and
set
down
his
glass
you
always
think
it
a
waste
of
time
if
you
ca
be
doctoring
somebody
muttered
tommy
do
be
offensive
said
ralston
i
know
what
the
matter
with
you
my
son
but
i
should
keep
it
to
myself
if
i
were
you
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
did
give
medical
advice
to
somebody
this
afternoon
which
of
course
he
wo
take
tommy
face
was
suddenly
scarlet
it
was
solely
the
maternal
protective
instinct
that
induced
ralston
to
bend
forward
and
speak
do
you
mean
captain
monck
gerald
she
asked
major
ralston
cast
a
comprehensive
glance
around
the
little
group
assembled
near
him
finishing
his
survey
upon
tommy
burning
countenance
yes
monck
he
said
he
staying
with
barnes
at
khanmulla
to
see
this
affair
through
if
i
were
monck
i
should
be
pretty
anxious
about
him
he
says
it
insomnia
is
he
ill
it
was
tommy
who
spoke
his
voice
quick
and
low
all
the
sullen
embarrassment
gone
from
his
demeanour
the
doctor
eyes
dwelt
upon
him
for
a
moment
longer
before
he
answered
i
never
saw
such
a
change
in
any
man
in
such
a
short
time
he
have
a
bad
if
he
does
watch
out
he
works
too
hard
said
ralston
sympathetically
her
husband
nodded
if
it
were
for
that
sickly
baby
of
hers
i
should
advise
his
wife
to
go
straight
to
him
and
look
after
him
but
perhaps
when
this
trial
is
over
he
will
be
able
to
take
a
rest
i
shall
order
the
whole
family
to
bhulwana
if
i
get
the
chance
he
got
up
with
the
words
and
faced
the
company
with
a
certain
dogged
aggressiveness
that
compelled
attention
it
hard
he
said
to
see
a
fine
chap
like
that
knocked
out
he
about
the
best
man
we
got
and
we
ca
afford
to
lose
him
he
waited
for
someone
to
take
up
the
challenge
but
no
one
showed
any
inclination
to
do
so
only
after
a
moment
tommy
also
sprang
up
as
if
there
was
something
in
the
situation
that
chafed
him
beyond
endurance
ralston
looked
at
him
again
critically
not
where
are
you
off
to
in
such
a
hurry
he
said
tommy
hunched
his
shoulders
all
defiance
in
a
second
going
for
a
ride
he
growled
any
objection
ralston
turned
away
none
whatever
my
young
porcupine
have
mercy
on
your
nag
that
all
and
do
break
your
own
neck
tommy
strode
wrathfully
away
to
the
sound
of
burton
tittering
laugh
with
the
exception
of
ralston
who
really
did
not
count
he
hated
every
one
of
the
party
that
he
left
behind
on
the
club
verandah
and
he
did
not
attempt
to
disguise
the
fact
but
when
an
hour
later
he
rolled
off
his
horse
in
the
compound
of
the
policeman
bungalow
at
khanmulla
his
mood
had
undergone
a
complete
change
there
was
nothing
defiant
or
even
assertive
about
him
as
he
applied
for
admittance
he
looked
beaten
tried
beyond
his
strength
it
was
growing
rapidly
dark
as
he
followed
barnes
into
the
long
bare
room
which
he
used
as
his
private
office
the
man
brought
him
a
lamp
and
told
him
that
the
would
be
back
soon
they
had
gone
down
to
the
court
house
again
but
they
might
return
at
any
time
he
also
brought
him
whisky
and
soda
which
tommy
did
not
touch
spending
the
interval
of
waiting
that
ensued
in
fevered
tramping
to
and
fro
he
had
not
seen
monck
alone
since
the
evening
of
tessa
nearly
three
weeks
before
on
the
score
of
business
connected
with
the
approaching
trial
monck
had
come
to
khanmulla
immediately
afterwards
and
no
one
at
kurrumpore
had
had
more
than
an
occasional
glimpse
of
him
since
but
he
meant
to
see
him
alone
now
and
he
had
given
very
explicit
instructions
to
that
effect
to
the
servant
accompanied
by
a
substantial
species
of
persuasion
that
could
not
fail
to
achieve
its
object
when
the
sound
of
voices
told
him
at
last
of
the
return
of
the
two
men
he
drew
back
out
of
sight
of
the
window
while
the
obsequious
went
forth
upon
his
errand
then
a
moment
or
two
later
he
heard
them
separate
and
one
alone
came
in
his
direction
everard
entered
with
the
gait
of
a
tired
man
the
lamp
dazzled
him
for
a
second
and
tommy
saw
him
first
he
smothered
an
involuntary
exclamation
and
stepped
forward
tommy
said
monck
as
if
incredulous
tommy
stood
in
front
of
him
his
hands
at
his
sides
yes
it
me
i
had
to
come
over
just
to
have
a
look
at
you
ralston
said
said
oh
damn
it
it
does
matter
what
he
said
only
i
had
to
just
come
and
see
for
myself
you
see
i
i
he
faltered
badly
but
recovered
himself
under
the
straight
gaze
of
everard
eyes
i
ca
get
the
thought
of
you
out
of
my
mind
i
been
a
damn
cur
you
wo
want
to
speak
to
me
of
course
but
when
ralston
started
jawing
about
you
this
afternoon
i
found
i
found
he
choked
suddenly
i
could
stand
it
any
longer
he
said
in
a
strangled
whisper
monck
was
looking
full
at
him
by
the
merciless
glare
of
the
lamp
on
the
table
which
revealed
himself
very
fully
also
all
the
grim
lines
in
his
face
seemed
to
be
accentuated
he
looked
years
older
the
hair
above
his
temples
gleamed
silver
where
it
caught
the
light
he
did
not
speak
at
once
only
as
tommy
made
a
blind
movement
as
if
to
go
he
put
forth
a
hand
and
took
him
by
the
arm
tommy
he
said
what
have
you
been
doing
out
of
deep
hollows
his
eyes
looked
forth
indomitable
relentless
as
they
had
ever
been
searching
the
boy
downcast
face
tommy
quivered
a
little
under
their
piercing
scrutiny
but
he
made
no
attempt
to
avoid
it
look
at
me
monck
commanded
he
raised
his
eyes
for
a
moment
and
in
spite
of
himself
monck
was
softened
by
the
utter
misery
they
held
you
always
were
an
ass
he
commented
but
i
thought
you
had
more
strength
of
mind
than
this
tommy
made
an
impotent
gesture
i
a
beast
i
a
skunk
he
declared
with
tremulous
vehemence
i
not
fit
to
speak
to
you
the
shadow
of
a
smile
crossed
monck
face
and
you
come
all
this
way
to
tell
me
so
he
said
you
no
business
here
either
you
ought
to
be
at
the
mess
damn
the
mess
said
tommy
fiercely
they
tell
me
i
ratted
i
do
care
let
say
what
they
like
it
you
that
matters
man
how
infernally
ill
you
look
monck
checked
the
personal
allusion
i
not
ill
but
what
have
you
been
up
to
are
you
in
a
row
tommy
essayed
a
laugh
no
nothing
serious
the
blithering
idiots
ducked
me
yesterday
for
being
disrespectful
that
all
i
do
care
it
you
i
care
about
everard
old
chap
his
voice
held
sudden
pleading
but
his
face
was
turned
away
he
had
meant
to
say
more
but
could
not
he
stood
biting
his
lips
desperately
in
a
mute
struggle
for
everard
waited
a
few
seconds
giving
him
time
then
abruptly
he
moved
slapped
a
hand
on
tommy
shoulder
and
gave
him
a
shake
tommy
do
be
so
beastly
cheap
i
ashamed
of
you
what
the
matter
tommy
yielded
impulsively
to
the
bracing
grip
but
he
kept
his
face
averted
that
just
it
he
blurted
out
i
feel
cheap
fact
is
i
came
i
came
to
ask
you
to
forgive
me
but
now
i
here
i
damned
if
i
have
the
cheek
what
do
you
want
my
forgiveness
for
i
thought
i
was
the
transgressor
everard
voice
was
a
curious
blend
of
humour
and
sadness
tommy
turned
to
him
with
a
sudden
boyish
gesture
so
spontaneous
as
to
override
all
barriers
oh
i
know
all
that
but
it
does
count
see
i
do
know
how
i
ever
had
the
infernal
presumption
to
think
it
did
or
to
ask
you
you
of
all
men
to
explain
your
actions
i
do
want
any
explanation
i
believe
in
you
without
simply
because
i
ca
help
it
i
know
without
any
proof
that
you
sound
and
and
i
beg
your
pardon
for
being
such
a
cur
as
to
doubt
you
there
that
what
i
came
to
say
now
it
your
turn
the
tears
were
in
his
eyes
but
he
made
no
further
attempt
to
hide
them
all
that
was
great
in
his
nature
had
come
to
the
surface
and
there
was
no
room
left
for
monck
realized
it
and
it
affected
him
deeply
depriving
him
of
the
power
to
respond
he
had
not
expected
this
from
tommy
had
not
believed
him
capable
of
it
but
there
was
no
doubting
the
boy
sincerity
through
those
tears
which
tommy
had
forgotten
to
hide
he
saw
the
old
loving
trust
shine
out
at
him
the
old
admiration
and
honour
offered
again
without
reservation
and
without
stint
he
opened
his
lips
to
speak
but
something
rose
in
his
throat
preventing
him
he
held
out
his
hand
in
silence
and
in
that
wordless
grip
the
love
which
is
greater
than
death
made
itself
felt
between
them
a
bond
imperishable
which
no
earthly
circumstance
could
ever
again
violate
the
power
omnipotent
which
conquers
all
things
chapter
ii
the
lamp
the
orange
light
of
the
morning
was
breaking
over
the
jungle
when
two
horsemen
rode
out
upon
the
kurrumpore
road
and
halted
between
the
rice
fields
i
say
come
on
a
bit
further
tommy
urged
there
plenty
of
time
but
the
other
shook
his
head
no
i
ca
i
promised
barnes
to
be
back
early
tommy
my
lad
keep
your
end
up
i
will
tommy
promised
and
thrust
out
a
hand
and
you
hang
on
wo
you
promise
all
right
for
the
present
my
love
to
bernard
everard
spoke
with
his
usual
brevity
but
his
handclasp
was
remembered
by
tommy
for
a
very
long
time
after
and
to
stella
he
said
pushing
his
horse
a
little
nearer
till
it
muzzled
against
its
fellow
everard
eyes
grave
and
dark
looked
out
to
the
low
horizon
i
think
not
he
said
she
has
no
further
use
for
it
she
will
have
said
tommy
quickly
but
everard
passed
the
matter
by
in
silence
you
must
be
getting
on
he
said
and
relaxed
his
grip
old
chap
you
done
me
good
if
that
is
any
consolation
to
you
oh
man
said
tommy
and
coloured
like
a
girl
not
not
really
everard
uttered
his
curt
laugh
and
switched
tommy
mount
across
the
withers
be
off
with
you
you
cuckoo
he
said
and
tommy
grinned
and
went
later
he
was
sounding
an
impatient
tatto
upon
his
door
she
came
herself
to
admit
him
but
the
look
upon
her
face
checked
the
greeting
on
his
lips
what
on
earth
the
matter
he
said
instead
she
was
shivering
as
if
with
cold
though
the
risen
sun
had
filled
the
world
with
warmth
it
occurred
to
him
as
he
entered
that
she
was
looking
pinched
and
ill
and
he
put
a
comforting
arm
around
her
what
is
it
stella
girl
tell
me
she
relaxed
against
him
with
a
sob
i
been
horribly
anxious
about
you
she
said
oh
is
that
all
said
tommy
what
a
waste
of
time
i
was
only
over
at
khanmulla
i
spent
the
night
at
barnes
bungalow
because
they
trust
me
in
the
jungle
after
dark
they
she
questioned
barnes
and
everard
tommy
said
and
faced
her
squarely
i
went
to
see
everard
ah
she
caught
her
breath
major
ralston
has
been
here
he
told
me
he
told
me
her
voice
failed
she
laid
her
head
down
upon
shoulder
he
tightened
his
arm
about
her
it
a
shame
of
ralston
to
frighten
you
he
is
then
a
sudden
thought
striking
him
what
was
he
doing
here
so
early
is
the
kid
up
to
the
mark
she
shivered
against
him
again
he
had
a
strange
attack
in
the
night
and
major
ralston
said
said
oh
tommy
she
suddenly
clung
to
him
i
am
going
to
lose
him
he
is
like
other
children
ralston
said
that
demanded
tommy
he
did
tell
me
he
told
bernard
i
practically
forced
bernard
to
tell
me
but
i
think
he
thought
i
ought
to
know
he
said
he
said
it
is
to
be
desired
that
my
baby
should
live
what
said
tommy
in
dismay
oh
my
darling
girl
i
am
sorry
wrong
with
the
poor
little
chap
with
her
face
hidden
against
him
she
made
whispered
answer
you
know
he
came
too
soon
they
thought
at
first
he
was
all
right
but
now
symptoms
have
begun
to
show
themselves
we
thought
he
was
just
delicate
but
it
is
only
that
last
night
in
the
night
she
shuddered
suddenly
and
violently
and
paused
to
control
herself
i
ca
talk
about
it
it
was
terrible
major
ralston
says
he
suffer
but
it
looks
like
suffering
and
oh
tommy
he
is
all
i
have
left
tommy
held
her
comfortingly
close
i
say
would
you
like
everard
to
come
to
you
he
said
oh
no
oh
no
her
refusal
was
instant
i
ca
see
him
tommy
why
suggest
such
a
thing
you
know
i
ca
i
know
he
a
good
man
tommy
said
steadily
just
listen
a
minute
old
girl
i
know
things
look
black
enough
against
him
so
black
that
it
probable
he
have
to
send
in
his
papers
but
i
tell
you
he
all
right
i
did
think
so
at
first
i
thought
the
same
as
you
do
but
somehow
that
suspicion
has
got
worn
out
it
was
pretty
beastly
while
it
lasted
but
i
came
to
my
senses
at
last
and
i
been
to
tell
him
so
he
was
jolly
decent
about
it
though
he
did
tell
me
a
thing
i
want
him
to
besides
he
always
is
decent
how
could
he
be
otherwise
and
now
we
just
as
we
were
friends
there
was
no
mistaking
the
satisfaction
in
tommy
voice
he
even
spoke
with
pride
and
hearing
it
stella
withdrew
herself
slowly
and
wearily
from
his
arms
it
rather
different
for
you
tommy
she
said
a
man
standards
are
different
i
know
there
may
be
what
you
call
extenuating
circumstances
though
i
ca
quite
imagine
it
i
too
tired
to
argue
about
it
tommy
dear
and
you
must
be
vexed
with
me
i
ca
go
into
it
with
you
but
i
feel
as
if
it
is
i
i
myself
who
have
committed
an
awful
sin
and
it
has
got
to
be
expiated
perhaps
that
is
why
my
baby
is
to
be
taken
from
me
bernard
says
it
is
not
so
but
then
bernard
is
a
man
too
there
was
a
sound
of
heartbreak
in
her
voice
as
she
ended
she
put
up
her
hands
with
a
gesture
as
of
trying
to
put
away
some
monstrous
thing
that
threatened
to
crush
her
a
gesture
that
went
straight
to
tommy
warm
heart
oh
poor
old
girl
he
said
impulsively
and
took
the
hands
into
his
own
i
say
ought
i
to
be
in
here
are
you
supposed
to
be
resting
she
smiled
at
him
wanly
i
believe
i
am
major
ralston
left
a
soothing
draught
but
i
would
take
it
in
case
she
broke
off
peter
is
on
guard
as
well
as
and
he
has
promised
to
call
me
if
if
again
she
stopped
i
do
think
is
much
good
she
resumed
she
was
nearly
frightened
out
of
her
senses
last
night
she
seems
to
think
there
is
something
supernatural
about
it
but
peter
peter
is
a
tower
of
strength
i
trust
him
implicitly
yes
he
a
good
chap
said
tommy
i
glad
you
got
him
anyway
i
wish
i
could
be
more
of
a
help
to
you
she
leaned
forward
and
kissed
him
you
are
very
dear
to
me
tommy
i
do
know
what
i
should
do
without
you
and
bernard
where
is
the
worthy
padre
asked
tommy
he
may
be
working
in
his
room
he
is
certainly
not
far
away
he
never
is
nowadays
i
go
and
find
him
said
tommy
but
look
here
dear
have
that
draught
of
ralston
and
lie
down
just
to
please
me
she
began
to
refuse
but
tommy
could
be
very
persuasive
when
he
chose
and
he
chose
on
this
occasion
finally
with
reluctance
she
yielded
since
as
he
pointed
out
she
needed
all
the
strength
she
could
muster
he
tucked
her
up
with
motherly
care
feeling
that
he
had
accomplished
something
worth
doing
and
then
seeing
that
exhaustion
would
do
the
rest
he
left
her
and
went
softly
forth
in
search
of
bernard
the
latter
however
was
not
in
the
bungalow
and
since
it
was
growing
late
tommy
had
a
hurried
bath
and
dressed
for
parade
he
was
bolting
a
hasty
in
the
when
a
quiet
step
on
the
verandah
warned
him
of
bernard
approach
and
in
a
moment
or
two
the
big
man
entered
a
pipe
in
his
mouth
and
a
book
under
his
arm
hullo
tommy
he
said
with
his
genial
smile
so
you
have
been
murdered
this
time
i
congratulate
you
thanks
said
tommy
i
congratulate
myself
also
said
bernard
patting
his
shoulder
by
way
of
greeting
if
it
were
against
my
principles
i
should
have
been
very
worried
about
you
my
lad
for
i
could
get
away
to
look
for
you
of
course
not
said
tommy
and
i
was
safe
enough
i
been
over
to
khanmulla
everard
made
me
spend
the
night
and
we
rode
back
this
morning
everard
he
is
here
bernard
looked
round
sharply
no
said
tommy
bluntly
but
he
ought
to
be
he
went
back
again
he
is
wanted
for
that
trial
business
i
say
things
are
pretty
rotten
here
are
they
is
the
little
kid
past
hope
i
am
afraid
so
bernard
spoke
very
gravely
his
kindly
face
was
more
sombre
than
tommy
had
ever
seen
it
but
can
nothing
be
done
the
boy
urged
it
break
stella
heart
to
lose
him
bernard
shook
his
head
nothing
whatever
i
am
afraid
major
ralston
has
suspected
trouble
for
some
time
it
seems
we
might
of
course
get
a
specialist
opinion
at
calcutta
but
the
baby
is
utterly
unfit
for
a
journey
of
any
kind
and
it
is
doubtful
if
any
doctor
would
come
all
this
way
especially
with
things
as
they
are
what
do
you
mean
said
tommy
bernard
looked
at
him
the
place
is
a
hotbed
of
discontent
if
not
anarchy
surely
you
know
that
tommy
shrugged
his
shoulders
that
nothing
new
it
what
we
here
for
yes
and
matters
are
getting
worse
i
hear
that
the
result
of
this
trial
will
probably
mean
the
rajah
enforced
abdication
and
if
that
happens
there
is
practically
bound
to
be
a
rising
tommy
laughed
that
been
the
situation
as
long
as
i
been
out
we
giving
him
enough
rope
and
i
hope
he
hang
though
i
afraid
he
wo
the
rising
will
probably
be
a
sort
of
chinese
cracker
affair
a
fizz
a
few
bangs
and
a
no
honour
and
glory
for
any
one
i
hope
you
are
right
said
bernard
and
i
hope
i
wrong
said
tommy
lightly
i
like
a
run
for
my
money
you
forget
the
women
said
bernard
abruptly
tommy
opened
his
eyes
no
i
do
they
be
all
right
they
have
to
clear
out
to
bhulwana
a
little
earlier
than
usual
they
be
safe
enough
there
you
can
go
and
look
after
sir
they
like
that
thank
you
tommy
bernard
smiled
in
spite
of
himself
it
kind
of
you
to
put
it
so
tactfully
now
tell
me
what
you
think
of
everard
is
he
really
ill
no
worried
to
death
that
all
he
talking
of
sending
in
his
papers
did
you
know
i
suspected
he
would
bernard
spoke
thoughtfully
he
must
do
it
said
tommy
with
vehemence
he
worth
all
the
rest
of
the
mess
put
together
you
must
let
him
bernard
lifted
his
brows
i
let
him
he
said
do
you
think
he
is
going
to
do
what
i
tell
him
i
know
you
have
influence
considerable
influence
with
him
tommy
said
you
ought
to
use
it
sir
you
really
ought
it
up
to
you
and
no
one
else
he
spoke
insistently
bernard
looked
at
him
attentively
you
changed
your
tune
somewhat
have
you
tommy
he
said
yes
said
tommy
bluntly
i
have
i
been
a
damn
fool
if
you
want
to
know
the
biggest
damnedest
fool
on
the
face
of
creation
and
been
and
told
him
so
for
no
particular
reason
bernard
blue
eyes
grew
keener
in
their
regard
he
looked
at
tommy
with
more
interest
than
he
had
ever
before
bestowed
upon
him
tommy
face
was
red
but
he
replied
without
embarrassment
certainly
i
come
to
my
senses
that
all
i
come
to
realize
what
i
really
knew
all
along
that
he
a
white
man
white
all
through
however
black
he
chooses
to
be
painted
and
i
ashamed
that
i
ever
doubted
him
he
has
told
you
anything
questioned
bernard
still
closely
surveying
the
flushed
countenance
no
said
tommy
and
his
voice
rang
on
a
note
of
indignant
pride
why
the
devil
should
he
tell
me
anything
i
his
friend
thank
the
gods
i
can
trust
him
without
bernard
held
out
his
hand
suddenly
the
interest
had
turned
to
something
warmer
he
looked
at
the
boy
with
genuine
admiration
i
take
off
my
hat
to
you
tommy
he
said
everard
is
a
deuced
lucky
man
what
said
tommy
and
turned
deep
crimson
oh
rot
sir
that
rot
he
gripped
the
extended
hand
with
warmth
notwithstanding
it
all
the
other
way
round
i
ca
tell
you
what
he
been
to
me
why
i
i
die
for
him
if
i
had
the
chance
yes
bernard
said
with
simplicity
i
sure
you
would
boy
and
just
that
i
like
about
you
you
just
the
sort
of
friend
he
needs
the
sort
of
friend
god
sends
along
to
hold
up
the
lamp
when
the
night
is
dark
there
you
want
to
be
off
i
wo
keep
you
but
you
a
white
man
yourself
tommy
and
i
sha
forget
it
oh
rats
rats
rats
said
tommy
rudely
and
escaped
through
the
window
at
headlong
speed
chapter
iii
tessa
mother
it
really
is
my
fault
said
netta
fretfully
i
do
see
why
you
should
lecture
me
about
it
mary
i
ca
help
being
attractive
my
dear
said
ralston
patiently
that
was
not
my
point
i
am
only
urging
you
to
show
a
little
discretion
you
do
not
want
to
be
an
object
of
scandal
i
am
sure
the
finger
of
suspicion
has
been
pointed
at
the
rajah
a
good
many
times
lately
and
i
do
think
that
for
sake
if
not
for
your
own
you
ought
to
put
a
check
upon
your
intimacy
with
him
bother
tessa
said
netta
i
do
see
that
i
owe
her
anything
ralston
sighed
a
little
but
she
persevered
the
child
is
at
an
age
when
she
needs
the
most
careful
training
surely
you
want
her
to
respect
you
netta
laughed
i
really
do
care
a
straw
what
she
does
tessa
interest
me
i
wanted
a
boy
you
know
i
never
had
any
use
for
girls
besides
she
gets
on
my
nerves
at
every
turn
we
shall
never
be
kindred
spirits
poor
little
tessa
said
ralston
gently
she
has
such
a
loving
heart
she
does
love
me
said
tessa
mother
without
regret
i
suppose
you
say
that
my
fault
too
everything
always
is
is
it
i
think
in
fact
i
am
sure
that
love
begets
love
said
ralston
perhaps
when
you
and
she
get
to
england
together
you
will
become
more
to
each
other
out
of
sheer
suggested
netta
oh
do
let
talk
of
england
i
hate
the
thought
of
it
i
sure
i
was
created
for
the
east
hence
the
sympathy
that
exists
between
the
rajah
and
myself
you
know
mary
you
really
are
absurdly
prejudiced
against
him
richard
was
the
same
he
never
had
any
cause
to
be
jealous
they
simply
did
come
into
the
same
category
ralston
looked
at
her
with
wonder
in
her
eyes
you
seem
to
forget
she
said
that
richard
murderer
is
being
tried
and
that
this
man
is
very
strongly
suspected
of
being
an
abettor
if
not
the
actual
instigator
of
the
crime
netta
flicked
the
ash
from
her
cigarette
with
a
gesture
of
impatience
i
only
wish
you
would
let
me
forget
these
unpleasant
things
she
said
why
do
you
go
and
preach
a
sermon
to
the
beautiful
stella
monck
on
the
same
text
ralph
dacre
death
was
quite
as
much
of
a
mystery
and
the
kindly
gossips
are
every
bit
as
busy
with
captain
monck
reputation
as
with
his
excellency
but
i
suppose
her
devotion
to
that
wretched
little
imbecile
baby
of
hers
renders
her
immune
she
spoke
with
intentional
malice
but
she
scarcely
expected
to
strike
home
mary
was
not
in
her
estimation
with
brains
and
she
never
seemed
to
mind
a
barbed
thrust
or
two
but
on
this
occasion
ralston
upset
her
calculations
she
arose
in
genuine
wrath
netta
she
said
i
think
you
are
the
most
heartless
callous
woman
i
have
ever
met
and
with
that
she
went
straight
from
the
room
shutting
the
door
firmly
behind
her
good
gracious
commented
netta
mary
in
a
tantrum
what
an
exciting
spectacle
she
stretched
her
slim
body
like
a
cat
as
she
lay
with
the
warm
sunshine
pouring
over
her
and
presently
she
laughed
how
funny
how
very
funny
netta
my
dear
they
be
calling
you
wicked
next
she
pursed
her
lips
over
the
adjective
as
if
she
rather
enjoyed
it
then
stretched
herself
again
luxuriously
with
sensuous
enjoyment
she
had
riden
with
the
rajah
in
the
early
morning
and
was
pleasantly
tired
the
sudden
approach
of
tessa
scampering
along
the
verandah
in
the
wake
of
scooter
sent
a
quick
frown
to
her
face
which
deepened
swiftly
as
scooter
dodging
nimbly
ran
into
the
room
and
went
to
earth
behind
a
bamboo
screen
tessa
sprang
in
after
him
but
pulled
up
sharply
at
sight
of
her
mother
the
frown
upon
netta
face
was
instantly
reflected
upon
her
own
she
stood
expectant
of
rebuke
what
a
noisy
child
you
are
said
netta
are
you
never
quiet
i
wonder
and
why
did
you
let
that
horrid
little
beast
come
in
here
you
know
i
detest
him
he
is
horrid
said
tessa
instantly
on
the
defensive
and
i
could
help
him
coming
in
i
did
know
you
were
here
but
it
your
bungalow
anyway
and
aunt
mary
does
mind
him
oh
go
away
said
netta
with
irritation
you
get
more
insufferable
every
day
take
the
little
brute
with
you
and
shut
him
up
or
drown
him
tessa
came
forward
with
an
insolent
shrug
there
was
more
than
a
spice
of
defiance
in
her
bearing
i
do
suppose
i
can
catch
him
she
said
but
i
try
the
chase
of
the
elusive
scooter
that
followed
would
have
been
an
affair
of
pure
pleasure
to
the
child
had
it
not
been
for
the
presence
of
her
mother
and
the
growing
exasperation
with
which
she
regarded
it
it
was
all
sheer
fun
to
scooter
who
wormed
in
and
out
of
the
furniture
with
mirth
in
his
gleaming
eyes
and
darted
past
the
window
a
dozen
times
without
availing
himself
of
that
means
of
escape
netta
small
stock
of
patience
was
very
speedily
exhausted
she
sat
up
on
the
sofa
and
sternly
commanded
tessa
to
desist
go
and
tell
the
to
catch
him
she
said
tessa
however
by
this
time
had
also
warmed
to
the
game
she
paid
no
more
attention
to
her
mother
order
than
she
would
have
paid
to
the
buzzing
of
a
mosquito
and
when
scooter
dived
under
the
sofa
on
which
netta
had
been
reclining
she
burrowed
after
him
with
a
squeal
of
merriment
it
was
too
much
for
netta
whose
feelings
had
been
decidedly
ruffled
before
tessa
entrance
as
scooter
shot
out
on
the
other
side
of
her
running
his
queer
zigzag
course
she
snatched
the
first
thing
that
came
to
hand
which
chanced
to
be
a
heavy
bronze
weight
from
the
at
her
elbow
and
hurled
it
at
him
with
all
her
strength
scooter
collapsed
on
the
floor
like
a
broken
mechanical
toy
tessa
uttered
a
wild
scream
and
flung
herself
upon
him
netta
gasped
hysterically
horrified
but
still
angry
it
serves
him
right
serves
you
both
right
now
go
away
she
said
tessa
turned
on
her
knees
on
the
floor
scooter
was
feebly
kicking
in
her
arms
the
missile
had
struck
him
on
the
head
and
one
eye
was
terribly
injured
she
gathered
him
up
to
her
little
narrow
chest
and
he
ceased
to
kick
and
became
quite
still
over
his
lifeless
body
she
looked
at
her
mother
with
eyes
of
burning
furious
hatred
you
killed
him
she
said
her
voice
sunk
very
low
and
i
hope
oh
i
do
hope
some
day
someone
will
kill
you
there
was
that
about
her
at
the
moment
that
actually
frightened
netta
and
it
was
with
undoubted
relief
that
she
saw
the
door
open
and
major
ralston
lounging
figure
block
the
entrance
what
all
this
noise
about
he
began
and
stopped
short
behind
him
stood
another
figure
broad
powerful
not
overtall
at
sight
of
it
tessa
uttered
a
hard
sob
and
scrambled
to
her
feet
she
still
clasped
poor
scooter
dead
body
to
her
breast
and
his
blood
was
on
her
face
and
on
the
white
frock
she
wore
uncle
bernard
look
look
she
said
she
killed
my
scooter
netta
also
arose
at
this
juncture
oh
do
take
that
horrible
thing
away
she
said
if
it
dead
so
much
the
better
it
was
no
more
than
a
weasel
after
all
i
hate
such
pets
major
ralston
found
himself
abruptly
though
not
roughly
pushed
aside
bernard
monck
swooped
down
with
the
action
of
a
practised
footballer
and
took
the
furry
thing
out
of
tessa
hold
his
eyes
were
very
bright
and
intensely
alert
but
he
did
not
seem
aware
of
tessa
mother
come
with
me
darling
he
said
to
the
child
i
can
help
he
trod
upon
the
carved
bronze
that
had
slain
scooter
as
he
turned
and
he
left
the
mark
of
his
heel
upon
it
the
deep
impress
of
an
angry
giant
the
door
closed
with
decision
upon
himself
and
the
child
and
major
ralston
was
left
alone
with
netta
she
looked
at
him
with
a
flushed
face
ready
to
defy
remonstance
but
he
stooped
without
speaking
and
picked
up
the
thing
that
bernard
had
tried
to
grind
to
powder
surveyed
it
with
a
lifted
brow
and
set
it
back
in
its
place
netta
promptly
collapsed
upon
the
sofa
oh
it
is
too
bad
she
sobbed
it
really
is
too
bad
now
i
suppose
you
too
are
going
to
be
brutal
major
ralston
cleared
his
throat
there
was
certainly
no
sympathy
in
his
aspect
but
his
manner
was
wholly
lacking
in
brutality
he
was
never
brutal
to
women
and
netta
ermsted
was
his
guest
as
well
as
his
patient
after
a
moment
he
sat
down
beside
her
and
there
was
nothing
in
the
action
to
mark
it
as
heroic
or
to
betray
the
fact
that
he
yearned
to
stamp
out
of
the
room
after
bernard
and
leave
her
severely
to
her
hysterics
no
good
in
being
upset
now
he
remarked
the
thing
done
and
crying
wo
undo
it
i
do
want
to
undo
it
declared
netta
i
always
did
detest
the
horrible
ferrety
thing
tessa
could
have
taken
it
home
with
her
either
so
it
just
as
well
it
gone
she
dried
her
eyes
with
a
vindictive
gesture
and
reached
for
the
cigarettes
hysterics
were
impossible
in
this
man
presence
he
was
like
a
shower
of
cold
water
i
should
if
i
were
you
remarked
major
ralston
with
the
air
of
a
man
performing
a
laborious
duty
you
smoke
too
many
of
netta
ignored
the
admonition
they
soothe
my
nerves
she
said
may
i
have
a
light
he
searched
his
pockets
and
apparently
drew
a
blank
netta
frowned
in
swift
irritation
how
stupid
i
thought
all
men
carried
matches
major
ralston
accepted
the
reproof
in
silence
he
was
like
a
large
dog
gravely
presenting
his
shoulder
to
the
nips
of
a
toy
terrier
well
said
netta
aggressively
he
looked
at
her
with
composure
talking
about
going
home
he
said
at
the
risk
of
appearing
inhospitable
i
think
it
is
my
duty
to
advise
you
very
strongly
to
go
as
soon
as
possible
indeed
she
looked
back
with
instant
hostility
and
why
he
did
not
immediately
reply
whether
with
reason
or
not
he
had
the
reputation
for
being
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
was
a
brilliant
she
laughed
a
short
unpleasant
laugh
she
was
never
quite
at
her
ease
with
him
notwithstanding
his
slowness
why
the
devil
should
i
major
ralston
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
with
massive
deliberation
because
he
said
slowly
there
going
to
be
the
devil
own
row
if
this
man
is
hanged
for
your
husband
murder
we
have
been
warned
to
that
effect
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
also
with
infinite
daintiness
oh
a
native
rumpus
that
does
impress
me
in
the
least
i
sha
go
for
that
major
ralston
eyes
wandered
round
the
room
as
if
in
search
of
inspiration
mary
is
going
he
observed
netta
laughed
again
lightly
flippantly
good
old
mary
where
is
she
going
to
his
eyes
came
down
upon
her
suddenly
like
the
flash
of
a
knife
she
has
consented
to
go
to
bhulwana
with
the
rest
he
said
but
i
beg
you
will
not
accompany
her
there
as
captain
ermsted
widow
and
he
spoke
as
one
hewing
his
way
the
chosen
friend
of
the
rajah
your
position
in
the
state
is
one
of
considerable
difficulty
possibly
even
of
danger
and
i
do
not
propose
to
allow
my
wife
to
take
unnecessary
risks
for
that
reason
i
must
ask
you
to
go
before
matters
come
to
a
head
you
have
stayed
too
long
already
good
gracious
said
netta
opening
her
eyes
wide
but
if
sacred
person
is
to
be
safely
stowed
at
bhulwana
what
is
to
prevent
my
remaining
here
if
i
so
choose
because
i
do
choose
to
let
you
ermsted
said
major
ralston
steadily
she
gazed
at
him
you
do
choose
you
his
eyes
did
battle
with
hers
since
that
slighting
allusion
to
his
wife
he
had
no
consideration
left
for
netta
that
is
so
he
said
in
his
heavy
fashion
i
have
already
pointed
out
that
you
would
be
on
your
own
account
to
go
not
to
mention
the
safety
oh
the
child
there
was
keenness
about
the
exclamation
which
almost
amounted
to
actual
dislike
i
tired
to
death
of
having
welfare
and
tessa
morals
rammed
down
my
throat
why
should
i
make
a
fetish
of
the
child
what
is
good
enough
for
me
is
surely
good
enough
for
her
i
am
afraid
i
do
agree
with
you
said
major
ralston
you
would
she
rejoined
you
and
mary
are
quite
antediluvian
in
your
idea
but
that
does
influence
me
i
am
glad
to
say
i
am
more
up
to
date
if
i
ca
stay
here
i
shall
go
to
udalkhand
there
a
hotel
there
as
well
as
here
of
sorts
said
major
ralston
also
udalkhand
is
nearer
to
the
seat
of
disturbance
well
i
do
care
netta
spoke
recklessly
i
not
going
to
be
dictated
to
what
a
mighty
scare
you
all
in
what
can
you
think
will
happen
even
if
a
few
natives
do
get
out
of
hand
plenty
of
things
might
happen
he
rejoined
getting
up
but
that
by
the
way
if
you
wo
listen
to
reason
i
am
wasting
my
time
but
he
spoke
with
abrupt
emphasis
you
will
not
take
tessa
to
udalkhand
netta
eyes
gleamed
i
shall
take
her
to
kamtchatka
if
i
choose
she
said
for
the
first
time
a
smile
crossed
major
ralston
face
he
turned
to
the
door
and
if
she
chooses
he
said
with
malicious
satisfaction
the
door
closed
upon
him
and
netta
was
left
alone
she
remained
motionless
for
a
few
moments
showing
her
teeth
a
little
in
an
answering
smile
then
with
a
swift
lissom
movement
that
would
have
made
tommy
compare
her
to
a
lizard
she
rose
with
a
white
determined
face
she
bent
over
the
and
scribbled
a
hasty
note
her
hand
shook
but
she
controlled
it
resolutely
words
flicked
rapidly
into
being
under
her
pen
i
shall
be
behind
the
tamarisks
chapter
iv
the
broad
road
bernard
monck
never
forgot
the
day
of
scooter
death
it
was
as
indelibly
fixed
in
his
memory
as
in
that
of
tessa
the
child
wild
agony
of
grief
was
of
so
utterly
abandoned
a
nature
as
to
be
almost
oriental
in
its
violence
the
passionate
force
of
her
resentment
against
her
mother
also
was
not
easy
to
cope
with
though
he
quelled
it
eventually
but
when
that
was
over
when
she
had
wept
herself
exhausted
in
his
arms
at
last
there
followed
a
period
of
numbness
that
made
him
seriously
uneasy
ralston
had
gone
out
before
the
tragedy
had
occurred
but
major
ralston
presently
came
to
his
relief
he
stooped
over
tessa
with
a
few
kindly
words
but
when
he
saw
the
child
face
his
own
changed
somewhat
this
wo
do
he
said
to
bernard
holding
the
slender
wrist
we
must
get
her
to
bed
where
her
tessa
little
hand
hung
limply
in
his
hold
she
seemed
to
be
yet
when
bernard
moved
to
lift
her
she
roused
herself
to
cling
around
his
neck
please
keep
me
with
you
dear
uncle
bernard
oh
please
do
go
away
i
wo
sweetheart
he
promised
her
the
was
nowhere
to
be
found
but
it
was
doubtful
if
her
presence
would
have
made
much
difference
since
tessa
would
not
stir
from
her
friend
sheltering
arms
and
wept
again
weakly
even
at
the
touch
so
it
was
bernard
who
carried
her
to
her
room
and
eventually
put
her
to
bed
under
major
ralston
directions
the
latter
face
was
very
grave
over
the
whole
proceeding
and
he
presently
fetched
something
in
a
and
gave
it
to
bernard
to
administer
tessa
tried
to
refuse
it
but
her
opposition
broke
down
before
very
gentle
insistence
she
would
do
anything
she
told
him
piteously
if
only
if
only
he
would
stay
with
her
so
bernard
stayed
sending
a
message
to
the
green
bungalow
to
explain
his
absence
which
found
ralston
as
well
as
stella
and
brought
the
former
back
in
haste
tessa
was
in
a
deep
sleep
by
the
time
she
arrived
but
hearing
that
stella
did
not
need
him
bernard
still
maintained
his
watch
only
permitting
ralston
to
relieve
him
while
he
partook
of
luncheon
with
her
husband
netta
did
not
appear
for
the
meal
to
the
unspoken
satisfaction
of
them
both
they
ate
almost
in
silence
major
ralston
being
sunk
in
a
species
of
moody
abstraction
which
bernard
did
not
disturb
until
the
meal
was
over
then
at
length
ere
he
rose
to
go
he
deliberately
broke
into
his
gloomy
reflections
will
you
tell
me
he
said
courteously
exactly
what
it
is
that
you
fear
with
regard
to
the
child
major
ralston
continued
to
be
abstracted
for
fully
thirty
seconds
after
the
quiet
question
then
as
bernard
did
not
repeat
it
but
merely
waited
he
replied
to
it
there
are
plenty
of
things
to
be
feared
for
a
child
like
that
it
a
criminal
shame
to
have
kept
her
out
here
so
long
what
i
actually
believe
to
be
the
matter
at
the
present
moment
is
heart
trouble
ah
i
thought
so
bernard
looked
across
at
him
with
grave
comprehension
she
had
a
bad
shock
the
other
day
yes
a
shock
to
the
whole
system
she
lives
on
wires
in
any
case
i
am
going
to
examine
her
presently
but
i
am
pretty
sure
i
am
right
what
she
really
wants
major
ralston
stopped
himself
abruptly
so
abruptly
that
a
twinkle
of
humour
shone
momentarily
in
bernard
eyes
do
jam
on
the
brakes
on
my
account
he
protested
gently
i
am
with
you
all
the
way
what
does
she
really
want
major
ralston
uttered
a
gruff
laugh
it
was
practically
impossible
not
to
confide
in
bernard
monck
she
wants
to
get
right
away
from
that
vicious
little
termagant
of
a
mother
of
hers
there
no
love
between
them
and
never
will
be
so
what
the
use
of
pretending
she
wants
to
get
into
a
wholesome
bracing
outdoor
atmosphere
with
someone
who
knows
how
to
love
her
she
probably
go
straight
to
the
bad
if
she
does
that
is
if
she
lives
long
enough
the
humour
had
died
in
bernard
eyes
they
shone
with
a
very
different
light
as
he
said
i
have
thought
the
same
thing
myself
he
paused
a
moment
then
slowly
do
you
think
her
mother
would
be
persuaded
to
hand
her
over
to
me
he
said
ralston
brows
went
up
to
you
for
good
and
all
do
you
mean
yes
in
his
steady
unhurried
fashion
bernard
made
answer
i
have
been
thinking
of
it
for
some
time
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
to
consult
you
about
it
that
i
came
here
i
want
it
more
than
ever
now
ralston
was
staring
openly
you
have
your
hands
full
he
remarked
bernard
smiled
i
daresay
but
you
see
we
chums
to
use
your
own
expression
i
know
how
to
love
her
i
could
make
her
happy
possibly
good
as
well
ralston
never
paid
compliments
but
after
a
considerable
pause
he
said
it
would
be
the
best
thing
that
ever
happened
to
the
imp
so
far
as
her
mother
permission
goes
i
should
say
she
is
cheap
enough
to
be
had
almost
without
asking
you
wo
need
to
use
much
persuasion
in
that
direction
an
infernal
shame
said
bernard
the
hot
light
again
in
his
eyes
ralston
agreed
with
him
all
the
same
tessa
can
be
a
positive
little
demon
when
she
likes
i
seen
it
so
i
know
she
has
got
a
good
deal
of
her
mother
temperament
only
with
a
generous
allowance
of
heart
thrown
in
yes
bernard
said
and
it
the
heart
that
counts
you
can
do
practically
anything
with
a
child
like
that
ralston
got
up
well
i
going
to
have
another
look
at
her
and
then
i
due
at
the
green
bungalow
i
ca
say
what
is
going
to
happen
there
you
ought
to
clear
out
all
of
you
but
a
journey
would
probably
be
fatal
to
monck
infant
just
now
i
ca
advise
it
wherever
stella
goes
i
go
said
bernard
firmly
yes
that
understood
ralston
gave
him
a
keen
look
you
in
charge
are
you
but
those
who
can
go
must
go
that
certain
that
scoundrel
will
be
convicted
in
a
day
or
two
and
then
look
out
for
squalls
bernard
smile
was
scarcely
the
smile
of
the
man
of
peace
oh
yes
i
shall
look
out
he
said
mildly
and
incidentally
tommy
is
teaching
me
how
to
shoot
they
returned
to
tessa
who
was
still
sleeping
and
ralston
gave
up
her
place
beside
her
to
bernard
who
settled
down
with
a
paper
to
spend
the
afternoon
major
ralston
departed
for
the
green
bungalow
and
the
silence
of
midday
fell
upon
the
place
it
was
still
early
in
the
year
but
the
warmth
was
as
that
of
a
soft
summer
day
in
england
the
lazy
drone
of
bees
hung
on
the
air
and
somewhere
among
the
tamarisks
a
small
persistent
bird
called
and
called
perpetually
receiving
no
reply
a
fine
example
of
perseverance
bernard
murmured
to
himself
he
had
plenty
of
things
to
think
about
to
worry
about
also
had
it
been
his
disposition
to
worry
but
the
utter
peace
that
surrounded
him
made
him
drowsy
he
nodded
uncomfortably
for
a
space
then
finally
since
he
seldom
did
things
by
halves
laid
aside
his
paper
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
serenely
slept
twice
during
the
afternoon
ralston
tiptoed
along
the
verandah
peeped
in
upon
them
and
retired
again
smiling
on
the
second
occasion
she
met
her
husband
on
the
same
errand
and
he
drew
her
aside
his
hand
through
her
arm
look
here
mary
i
talked
to
that
little
spitfire
without
much
result
she
talks
in
a
random
fashion
of
going
to
udalkhand
what
her
actual
intentions
are
i
do
know
possibly
she
does
know
herself
but
one
thing
is
certain
she
is
not
going
to
be
attached
to
your
train
any
longer
and
i
have
told
her
so
oh
gerald
she
looked
at
him
in
dismay
how
inhospitable
of
you
yes
is
it
his
hand
was
holding
her
arm
firmly
you
see
i
chance
to
value
your
safety
more
than
my
reputation
for
kindness
to
outsiders
you
are
going
to
bhulwana
at
the
end
of
this
week
come
you
promised
yes
i
know
i
did
she
looked
at
him
with
distress
in
her
eyes
wished
i
had
ever
since
there
is
my
poor
stella
in
bad
trouble
for
one
thing
she
says
she
will
have
to
change
her
and
there
is
she
has
got
peter
and
her
she
does
want
you
too
said
her
husband
and
now
there
is
little
tessa
proceeded
ralston
growing
more
and
more
worried
as
she
proceeded
yes
there
is
tessa
he
agreed
you
can
offer
to
take
her
to
bhulwana
with
you
if
you
like
but
not
her
mother
as
well
that
is
understood
it
wo
break
her
heart
to
part
with
her
i
fancy
as
for
you
my
dear
he
gave
her
a
whimsical
look
the
sooner
you
are
gone
the
better
i
shall
be
pleased
lady
harriet
and
the
burton
contingent
left
i
hate
going
declared
ralston
almost
tearfully
i
have
promised
if
i
could
have
foreseen
all
that
was
going
to
happen
he
squeezed
her
arm
all
the
same
you
promised
so
do
be
silly
she
turned
suddenly
and
clung
to
him
gerald
i
want
to
stay
with
you
let
me
stay
i
ca
bear
the
thought
of
you
alone
and
in
danger
he
stared
for
a
moment
in
astonishment
demonstrations
of
affection
were
almost
unknown
between
them
then
with
a
shamefaced
gesture
he
bent
and
kissed
her
what
a
silly
old
woman
he
said
that
ended
the
discussion
and
she
knew
that
her
plea
had
been
refused
but
the
fashion
of
its
refusal
brought
the
warm
colour
to
her
faded
face
and
she
was
even
near
to
laughing
in
the
midst
of
her
woe
how
dear
of
gerald
to
put
it
like
that
she
did
not
feel
that
she
had
ever
fully
realized
his
love
for
her
until
that
moment
seeing
that
her
presence
in
her
own
bungalow
was
not
needed
just
then
she
betook
herself
once
more
to
stella
and
again
the
afternoon
silence
fell
like
a
spell
of
enchantment
that
there
could
be
any
element
of
unrest
anywhere
within
that
charmed
region
seemed
a
thing
impossible
the
peace
of
eden
brooded
everywhere
the
evening
was
drawing
on
ere
bernard
slowly
emerged
from
his
serene
slumber
and
looked
at
the
child
beside
him
some
invisible
influence
or
perhaps
some
bond
of
sympathy
between
them
had
awakened
her
at
the
same
moment
for
her
eyes
were
fixed
upon
him
they
shone
intensely
mysteriously
blue
in
the
subdued
light
wistful
searching
eyes
wholly
unlike
the
eyes
of
a
child
her
hand
came
out
to
his
have
you
been
here
all
the
time
dear
she
said
she
seemed
to
be
still
in
the
veil
of
sleep
he
leaned
to
her
holding
the
little
hand
up
against
his
cheek
almost
my
princess
he
said
she
nestled
to
him
snuggling
her
fair
head
into
his
shoulder
i
been
dreaming
she
whispered
have
you
my
darling
he
gathered
her
close
with
a
compassionate
tenderness
for
the
frailty
of
the
little
throbbing
body
he
held
tessa
arms
crept
round
his
neck
i
dreamt
she
said
that
you
and
i
uncle
bernard
were
walking
in
a
great
big
city
and
there
was
a
church
with
a
golden
spire
there
were
a
lot
of
steps
up
to
it
and
scooter
a
sob
rose
in
her
throat
and
was
swiftly
suppressed
was
sunning
himself
on
the
top
and
i
tried
to
run
up
the
steps
and
catch
him
but
there
were
always
more
and
more
and
more
steps
and
i
get
any
nearer
and
i
cried
at
last
i
was
so
tired
and
disappointed
and
then
the
bony
arms
tightened
you
came
up
behind
me
and
took
my
hand
and
said
do
you
kneel
down
and
pray
it
much
the
quickest
way
and
so
i
did
said
tessa
simply
and
all
of
a
sudden
the
steps
were
gone
and
you
and
i
went
in
together
i
tried
to
pick
up
scooter
but
he
ran
away
and
i
did
mind
i
knew
he
was
safe
i
was
so
happy
so
very
happy
i
did
want
to
wake
again
a
doleful
note
crept
into
tessa
voice
she
swallowed
another
sob
bernard
lifted
her
bodily
from
the
bed
to
his
arms
do
fret
little
sweetheart
i
here
he
said
she
lifted
her
face
to
his
very
wet
and
piteous
uncle
bernard
i
been
praying
and
praying
ever
such
a
lot
since
my
you
said
i
might
did
you
but
god
has
taken
any
notice
he
held
her
close
what
have
you
been
praying
for
my
darling
he
said
i
do
so
want
to
be
your
little
girl
answered
tessa
with
a
break
in
her
voice
i
never
really
prayed
for
anything
before
only
the
things
aunt
mary
made
me
say
and
they
were
what
i
wanted
but
i
do
want
this
and
i
believe
i
get
quite
good
if
i
was
your
little
girl
i
told
god
so
but
i
do
think
he
cared
yes
he
did
care
darling
very
softly
bernard
reassured
her
you
think
that
ever
he
is
going
to
answer
that
prayer
of
yours
pretty
soon
now
oh
is
he
said
tessa
brightening
how
do
you
know
is
he
going
to
say
yes
i
think
so
bernard
voice
and
touch
were
alike
motherly
but
you
must
be
patient
a
little
longer
my
princess
of
the
bluebell
it
good
for
us
to
have
things
straight
off
when
we
want
them
you
do
want
me
insinuated
tessa
squeezing
his
neck
very
hard
yes
i
want
you
very
much
he
said
i
love
you
said
tessa
with
passionate
warmth
better
yes
better
now
than
even
uncle
everard
and
i
did
think
i
ever
could
do
that
god
bless
you
little
one
he
said
later
when
major
ralston
had
seen
her
again
they
had
another
conference
the
doctor
suspicions
were
fully
justified
tessa
would
need
the
utmost
care
she
shall
have
it
bernard
said
but
i
ca
leave
stella
now
i
shall
see
my
way
clearer
presently
quite
so
ralston
agreed
my
wife
shall
look
after
the
child
at
bhulwana
it
will
keep
her
quiet
he
gave
bernard
a
shrewd
look
perhaps
you
and
monck
also
will
be
on
your
way
home
before
the
hot
weather
he
said
in
that
case
she
could
go
with
you
bernard
was
silent
it
was
impossible
to
look
forward
one
thing
was
certain
he
could
not
desert
stella
ralston
passed
on
being
reticent
himself
he
respected
a
man
who
could
keep
his
own
counsel
what
about
mrs
ermsted
he
said
when
will
you
see
her
said
bernard
setting
his
jaw
ralston
smiled
briefly
that
look
recalled
his
brother
no
time
like
the
present
he
said
but
the
time
for
consultation
with
netta
ermsted
upon
the
future
of
her
child
was
already
past
when
bernard
very
firm
and
purposeful
walked
down
again
after
dinner
that
night
ralston
met
him
with
a
wry
expression
and
put
a
crumpled
note
into
his
hand
ermsted
has
apparently
divined
your
benevolent
intentions
he
said
bernard
read
in
silence
with
meeting
brows
dear
mary
this
is
to
wish
you
and
all
kind
friends
so
that
there
may
be
no
misunderstanding
on
the
part
of
our
charitable
gossips
pray
tell
them
at
once
that
i
have
finally
chosen
the
broad
road
as
it
really
suits
me
best
as
for
tessa
i
bequeath
her
and
her
little
morals
to
the
first
busybody
who
cares
to
apply
for
them
perhaps
the
worthy
father
monck
would
like
to
acquire
virtue
in
this
fashion
i
find
the
task
only
breeds
vice
in
me
many
thanks
for
your
laborious
and
i
fear
wholly
futile
attempts
to
keep
me
in
the
much
too
narrow
way
yours
netta
bernard
looked
up
from
the
note
with
such
fiery
eyes
that
ralston
who
was
on
the
verge
of
a
scathing
remark
himself
had
to
stop
out
of
sheer
curiosity
to
see
what
he
would
say
a
damnably
cruel
and
heartless
woman
said
bernard
with
deliberation
ralston
smile
expressed
what
for
him
was
warm
approval
she
nothing
but
an
animal
he
said
bernard
took
him
up
short
you
wrong
the
animals
he
said
the
very
least
of
them
love
their
young
ralston
shrugged
his
shoulders
all
the
better
for
tessa
anyhow
bernard
eyes
softened
very
suddenly
he
crumpled
the
note
into
a
ball
and
tossed
it
from
him
yes
he
said
quietly
god
helping
me
it
shall
be
all
the
better
for
her
chapter
v
the
dark
night
an
owl
hooted
across
the
compound
and
a
paraquet
disturbed
by
the
outcry
uttered
a
shrill
indignant
protest
an
immense
moon
hung
suspended
as
it
were
in
making
all
things
intense
with
its
radiance
it
was
the
hour
before
the
dawn
stella
stood
at
her
window
gazing
forth
and
numbly
marvelling
at
the
splendour
as
of
old
it
struck
her
like
a
weird
fantasy
this
indian
enchantment
poignant
passionate
holding
more
of
anguish
than
of
ecstasy
yet
deeply
magnetic
deeply
alluring
as
a
magic
potion
which
once
tasted
must
enchain
the
senses
for
ever
the
extravagance
of
that
world
of
dreadful
black
and
dazzling
silver
the
stillness
that
was
yet
indescribably
electric
the
unreality
that
was
allegorically
real
she
felt
it
all
as
a
vague
accompaniment
to
the
heartache
that
never
left
her
the
scornful
mockery
of
the
goddess
she
had
refused
to
worship
there
were
even
times
when
the
very
atmosphere
seemed
to
her
charged
with
hostility
a
terrible
overwhelming
antagonism
that
closed
about
her
in
a
narrowing
ring
which
constricted
her
ever
more
and
more
from
which
she
could
never
hope
to
escape
for
still
the
old
idea
haunted
her
she
was
a
trespasser
upon
forbidden
ground
once
she
had
been
cast
forth
but
she
had
dared
to
return
braving
the
flaming
sword
and
now
and
now
it
barred
her
in
cutting
off
her
escape
for
she
was
as
much
a
prisoner
as
if
iron
walls
surrounded
her
sentence
had
gone
forth
against
her
she
would
not
be
cast
forth
again
until
she
had
paid
the
uttermost
farthing
endured
the
ultimate
torture
then
only
childless
and
desolate
and
broken
would
she
be
turned
adrift
in
the
desert
to
return
no
more
for
ever
the
ghastly
glamour
of
the
night
attracted
and
repelled
her
like
the
swing
of
a
mighty
pendulum
she
was
trying
to
pray
that
much
had
bernard
taught
her
but
her
prayer
only
ran
blind
and
futile
through
her
brain
the
hour
should
have
been
sacred
but
it
was
marred
and
desecrated
by
the
stark
glare
of
that
nightmare
moon
she
was
worn
out
with
long
and
anxious
watching
and
she
had
almost
ceased
to
look
for
comfort
so
heavy
were
the
clouds
that
menaced
her
the
thought
of
everard
was
ever
with
her
strive
as
she
might
to
drive
it
out
at
such
moments
as
these
she
yearned
for
him
with
a
sick
and
desperate
longing
his
strength
his
tenderness
his
understanding
he
and
he
alone
would
have
known
how
to
comfort
her
now
with
her
baby
dying
before
her
eyes
he
would
have
held
her
up
through
her
darkest
hours
his
arm
would
have
borne
her
forward
however
terrible
the
path
she
had
bernard
and
she
had
tommy
each
keen
and
ready
in
her
service
she
sometimes
thought
that
but
for
bernard
she
would
have
been
overwhelmed
long
since
but
he
could
not
fill
the
void
within
her
he
could
not
even
touch
the
aching
longing
that
gnawed
so
perpetually
at
her
heart
that
was
a
pain
she
would
have
to
endure
in
silence
all
the
rest
of
her
life
she
did
not
think
she
would
ever
see
everard
again
though
only
a
few
miles
lay
between
them
at
present
he
might
have
been
already
a
world
away
she
was
sure
he
would
not
come
back
to
her
unless
she
summoned
him
the
manner
of
his
going
though
he
had
taken
no
leave
of
her
had
been
somehow
final
and
she
could
not
call
him
back
even
if
she
would
he
had
deceived
her
cruelly
of
set
intention
and
she
could
never
trust
him
again
the
memory
of
ralph
dacre
tainted
all
her
thoughts
of
him
he
had
sworn
he
had
not
killed
him
perhaps
not
perhaps
not
yet
was
the
conviction
ever
with
her
that
he
had
sent
him
to
his
death
had
intended
him
to
die
she
had
given
up
reasoning
the
matter
it
was
beyond
her
she
was
too
hopelessly
plunged
in
darkness
tommy
with
all
his
staunchness
could
not
lift
that
overwhelming
cloud
and
bernard
she
did
not
know
what
bernard
thought
save
that
he
had
once
reminded
her
that
a
man
should
be
regarded
as
innocent
unless
he
could
be
proved
guilty
it
was
common
talk
now
that
everard
indian
career
was
ended
it
was
only
the
trial
at
khanmulla
that
had
delayed
the
sending
in
of
his
papers
he
was
as
much
a
broken
man
however
hotly
tommy
contested
the
point
as
if
he
had
been
condemned
by
a
surely
had
he
been
truly
innocent
he
would
have
demanded
a
and
vindicated
himself
but
he
had
suffered
his
honour
to
go
down
in
silence
what
more
damning
evidence
could
be
supplied
than
this
the
dumb
sympathy
of
peter
eyes
kept
the
torturing
thought
constantly
before
her
she
felt
sure
that
peter
believed
him
guilty
of
murder
though
it
was
more
than
possible
that
in
his
heart
he
condoned
the
offence
perhaps
he
even
admired
him
for
it
she
reflected
shudderingly
but
his
devotion
to
her
as
always
was
uppermost
his
fidelity
surrounded
her
with
unfailing
service
the
had
gone
and
he
had
slipped
into
her
place
as
naturally
as
if
he
had
always
occupied
it
even
now
while
stella
stood
at
her
window
gazing
forth
into
the
garish
moonlight
was
he
softly
padding
to
and
fro
in
the
room
adjoining
hers
hushing
the
poor
little
wailing
infant
to
sleep
she
could
trust
him
implicitly
she
knew
even
in
moments
of
crisis
he
would
gladly
work
himself
to
death
in
her
service
but
with
ralston
gone
to
bhulwana
she
knew
she
must
have
further
help
the
strain
was
incessant
and
major
ralston
insisted
that
she
must
have
a
woman
with
her
all
the
ladies
of
the
station
save
herself
had
gone
she
knew
vaguely
that
some
sort
of
disturbance
was
expected
at
khanmulla
and
that
it
might
spread
to
kurrumpore
but
her
baby
was
too
ill
for
travel
she
had
practically
forced
this
truth
from
major
ralston
and
so
she
had
no
choice
but
to
remain
she
knew
very
well
at
the
heart
of
her
that
it
would
not
be
for
long
no
thought
of
personal
danger
troubled
her
sinister
though
the
night
might
seem
to
her
stretched
nerves
yet
no
sense
of
individual
peril
penetrated
the
weary
bewilderment
of
her
brain
she
was
tired
out
in
mind
and
body
and
had
yielded
to
peter
persuasion
to
take
a
rest
but
the
weird
cry
of
the
had
drawn
her
to
the
window
and
the
glittering
splendour
of
the
night
had
held
her
there
she
turned
from
it
at
last
with
a
long
long
sigh
and
lay
down
just
as
she
was
she
always
held
herself
ready
for
a
call
at
any
time
those
strange
seizures
came
so
suddenly
and
were
becoming
increasingly
violent
it
was
many
days
since
she
had
permitted
herself
to
sleep
soundly
she
lay
for
awhile
almost
painfully
conscious
listening
to
peter
muffled
movements
in
the
other
room
the
baby
had
ceased
to
cry
but
he
was
still
prowling
to
and
fro
tireless
and
patient
with
an
endurance
that
was
almost
superhuman
she
had
done
the
same
thing
a
little
earlier
till
her
limbs
had
given
way
beneath
her
in
the
daytime
bernard
helped
her
but
she
and
peter
shared
the
nights
her
senses
became
at
last
a
little
blurred
the
night
seemed
to
have
spread
over
half
a
lifetime
a
practically
endless
vista
of
suffering
the
soft
footfall
in
the
other
room
made
her
think
of
the
sentry
at
the
gate
that
sentry
with
the
flaming
sword
who
never
slept
it
beat
with
a
pitiless
thudding
upon
her
brain
later
it
grew
intermittent
fitful
as
if
at
each
turn
the
sentry
paused
it
always
went
on
again
or
so
she
thought
and
she
was
sure
she
was
not
deeply
sleeping
or
that
haunting
cry
of
an
owl
had
not
penetrated
her
consciousness
so
frequently
once
oddly
there
came
to
her
perhaps
it
was
a
dream
a
sound
as
of
voices
whispering
together
she
turned
in
her
sleep
and
tried
to
listen
but
her
senses
were
fogged
benumbed
she
could
not
at
the
moment
drag
herself
free
from
the
stupor
of
weariness
that
held
her
but
she
was
sure
of
peter
quite
sure
that
he
would
call
her
if
any
emergency
arose
and
there
was
no
one
with
whom
he
could
be
whispering
so
she
was
sure
it
must
be
a
dream
imperceptibly
she
sank
still
deeper
into
slumber
and
forgot
it
was
several
hours
later
that
tommy
returned
from
early
parade
flung
himself
impetuously
down
at
the
table
opposite
bernard
with
a
brief
now
for
it
bernard
was
reading
a
letter
and
tommy
eyes
fastened
upon
it
as
his
were
lifted
what
that
a
letter
from
everard
he
asked
unceremoniously
yes
he
has
written
to
tell
me
definitely
that
he
has
sent
in
his
resignation
and
it
has
been
accepted
bernard
reply
was
wholly
courteous
the
boy
bluntness
notwithstanding
he
had
a
respect
for
tommy
oh
damn
said
tommy
with
fervor
what
is
he
going
to
do
now
he
does
tell
me
that
bernard
folded
the
letter
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
what
your
news
he
inquired
tommy
marked
the
action
with
somewhat
jealous
eyes
he
had
been
aware
of
everard
intention
for
some
time
it
had
been
more
or
less
inevitable
but
he
wished
he
had
written
to
him
also
there
were
several
things
he
would
have
liked
to
know
he
looked
at
bernard
rather
blankly
ignoring
his
question
what
the
devil
is
he
going
to
do
he
said
dropout
bernard
candid
eyes
met
his
honestly
i
do
know
he
said
perhaps
he
is
just
waiting
for
orders
will
he
come
back
here
questioned
tommy
bernard
shook
his
head
no
i
pretty
sure
he
wo
now
tell
me
your
news
oh
it
nothing
said
tommy
impatiently
nothing
i
mean
compared
to
his
clearing
out
the
trial
is
over
and
the
man
is
condemned
he
is
to
be
executed
next
week
it
mean
a
shine
of
some
sort
nothing
very
great
i
am
afraid
that
all
said
bernard
with
a
smile
no
not
quite
all
there
was
some
secret
information
given
which
it
is
supposed
was
rather
damaging
to
the
rajah
for
he
has
taken
to
his
heels
no
one
knows
where
he
is
or
at
least
no
one
admits
he
does
you
know
these
oriental
chaps
they
can
cover
the
scent
of
a
rotten
herring
he
probably
never
turn
up
again
the
place
is
too
hot
to
hold
him
he
can
finish
his
rotting
in
another
corner
of
the
empire
and
i
wish
netta
ermsted
joy
of
her
bargain
ended
tommy
with
vindictive
triumph
my
good
fellow
protested
bernard
tommy
uttered
a
reckless
laugh
you
know
it
as
well
as
i
do
she
was
done
for
from
the
moment
he
taught
her
the
opium
habit
there
no
escape
from
that
and
the
devil
knew
it
i
say
what
a
mercy
it
will
be
when
you
can
get
tessa
away
to
england
and
stella
too
said
bernard
turning
to
the
subject
with
relief
you
wo
do
that
said
tommy
quickly
how
do
you
know
that
bernard
look
had
something
of
a
piercing
quality
but
tommy
eluded
all
search
i
do
know
i
ca
tell
you
how
but
certain
dead
certain
that
stella
wo
go
back
to
england
with
you
this
spring
you
something
of
a
prophet
tommy
remarked
bernard
after
an
attentive
pause
it
not
my
only
accomplishment
rejoined
tommy
modestly
i
several
things
besides
that
i
got
some
brains
too
just
a
few
funny
it
ah
here
is
stella
come
and
break
your
fast
old
girl
what
the
latest
he
went
to
meet
her
and
drew
her
to
the
table
she
smiled
in
her
wan
rather
abstracted
way
at
bernard
whom
she
had
seen
before
oh
do
get
up
she
said
i
only
came
for
a
glimpse
of
you
both
i
had
in
my
room
peter
saw
to
that
baby
is
very
weak
this
morning
and
i
thought
perhaps
tommy
dear
when
you
go
back
you
would
see
major
ralston
for
me
and
ask
him
to
come
up
soon
she
sat
down
with
an
involuntary
gesture
of
weariness
have
you
slept
at
all
bernard
asked
her
gently
oh
yes
thank
you
i
had
three
hours
of
undisturbed
rest
peter
was
splendid
you
must
have
another
bernard
said
it
is
fit
for
you
to
go
on
in
this
way
no
she
spoke
with
the
docility
of
exhaustion
peter
is
seeing
to
it
he
always
sees
to
everything
he
knows
a
woman
in
the
bazaar
who
would
do
an
elderly
woman
i
think
he
said
she
is
the
grandmother
of
hafiz
who
sells
trinkets
you
know
hafiz
i
expect
i
do
like
him
but
he
is
supposed
to
be
respectable
and
peter
is
prepared
to
vouch
for
the
woman
respectability
only
she
has
been
terribly
disfigured
by
an
accident
burnt
i
think
he
said
and
she
wears
a
veil
i
told
him
that
did
matter
baby
is
too
ill
to
notice
and
he
evidently
wants
me
to
have
her
he
says
she
has
been
used
to
english
children
and
is
a
good
nurse
that
is
what
matters
chiefly
so
i
have
told
him
to
engage
her
i
am
very
glad
to
hear
it
bernard
said
yes
i
think
it
will
be
a
relief
those
screaming
fits
are
so
terrible
stella
checked
a
sharp
shudder
peter
would
not
recommend
her
if
he
did
not
personally
know
her
to
be
trustworthy
she
added
quietly
no
peter
safe
enough
said
tommy
he
was
bolting
his
meal
with
great
expedition
is
the
kiddie
worse
stella
she
looked
at
him
with
that
in
her
tired
eyes
that
went
straight
to
his
heart
he
is
a
little
worse
every
day
she
said
tommy
swore
into
his
cup
and
asked
no
further
a
few
moments
later
he
got
up
gave
her
a
brief
kiss
and
departed
stella
sat
on
with
her
chin
in
her
hand
every
line
of
her
expressing
the
weariness
of
the
hopeless
watcher
she
looked
crushed
as
if
a
burden
she
could
hardly
support
had
been
laid
upon
her
bernard
looked
at
her
once
or
twice
without
speaking
finally
he
too
rose
went
round
to
her
knelt
beside
her
put
his
arm
about
her
her
face
quivered
a
little
i
got
to
keep
strong
she
said
in
the
tone
of
one
who
had
often
said
the
same
thing
in
solitude
i
know
he
said
and
so
you
will
there
special
strength
given
for
such
times
as
these
it
wo
fail
you
now
she
put
her
hand
into
his
thank
you
she
said
and
then
with
an
effort
do
you
know
bernard
i
tried
i
really
tried
to
pray
in
the
night
before
i
lay
down
but
there
was
something
so
wicked
about
it
i
simply
could
one
ca
always
he
said
oh
have
you
found
that
too
she
asked
he
smiled
at
the
question
of
course
i
have
so
has
everybody
only
children
stella
god
knows
that
he
does
expect
of
us
more
than
we
can
manage
prayer
is
only
one
of
the
means
we
have
of
reaching
him
it
ca
be
used
always
there
are
some
people
who
have
time
for
prayer
even
and
yet
they
may
be
very
near
to
god
in
times
of
stress
like
yours
one
is
often
much
nearer
than
one
realizes
you
will
find
that
out
quite
suddenly
one
of
these
days
find
that
through
all
your
desert
journeying
he
has
been
guiding
you
protecting
you
surrounding
you
with
the
most
loving
care
and
because
the
night
was
dark
you
never
knew
it
the
night
is
certainly
very
dark
stella
said
with
a
tremulous
smile
if
it
were
for
you
i
do
think
i
could
ever
get
through
oh
do
say
that
he
said
if
it
were
me
it
would
be
someone
else
or
possibly
a
closer
vision
of
himself
there
is
always
something
something
to
which
later
you
will
look
back
and
say
was
his
lamp
in
the
desert
showing
the
way
do
fret
if
you
pray
i
can
pray
for
you
you
just
keep
on
being
brave
and
patient
he
understands
stella
fingers
pressed
upon
his
you
are
good
to
me
bernard
she
said
i
shall
think
of
what
you
say
the
next
time
i
am
alone
in
the
night
his
arm
held
her
sustainingly
and
if
you
very
desolate
child
come
and
call
me
he
said
i
always
at
hand
always
glad
to
serve
you
she
smiled
a
difficult
smile
i
shall
need
you
more
afterwards
she
said
under
her
breath
and
then
as
if
words
had
suddenly
become
impossible
to
her
she
leaned
against
him
and
kissed
him
he
gathered
her
up
close
as
if
she
had
been
a
weary
child
god
bless
you
my
dear
he
said
chapter
vi
the
first
glimmer
it
was
from
the
colonel
himself
that
stella
heard
of
retirement
he
walked
back
from
the
mess
that
night
with
tommy
and
asked
to
see
her
for
a
few
minutes
alone
he
was
always
kinder
to
her
in
his
absence
she
was
busy
installing
the
new
whom
peter
with
the
air
of
a
magician
who
has
but
to
wave
his
wand
had
presented
to
her
half
an
hour
before
the
woman
was
old
and
bent
and
closely
veiled
so
closely
that
stella
strongly
suspected
her
disfigurement
to
be
of
a
very
ghastly
nature
but
her
low
voice
and
capable
manner
inspired
her
with
instinctive
confidence
she
realized
with
relief
from
the
very
outset
that
her
faithful
peter
had
not
made
a
mistake
she
was
sure
that
the
had
nursed
sickly
english
children
before
she
went
to
the
colonel
leaving
the
strange
woman
in
charge
of
her
baby
and
peter
hovering
reassuringly
in
the
background
his
first
greeting
of
her
had
a
touch
of
diffidence
but
when
he
saw
the
weary
suffering
of
her
eyes
this
was
swallowed
up
in
pity
he
took
her
hands
and
held
them
my
poor
girl
he
said
she
smiled
at
him
pity
from
an
outsider
did
not
penetrate
to
the
depths
of
her
thank
you
for
coming
she
said
he
coughed
and
cleared
his
throat
i
hope
it
is
an
intrusion
he
said
but
of
course
not
she
made
answer
how
could
it
be
wo
you
sit
down
he
led
her
to
a
chair
but
he
did
not
sit
down
himself
he
stood
before
her
with
something
of
the
air
of
a
man
making
a
confession
monck
he
said
i
think
i
ought
to
tell
you
that
it
was
by
my
advice
that
your
husband
resigned
his
commission
her
brows
drew
together
a
little
as
if
at
a
momentary
dart
of
pain
has
he
resigned
it
she
said
yes
did
he
tell
you
he
frowned
have
you
seen
him
do
you
know
where
he
is
she
shook
her
head
i
can
only
think
of
my
baby
just
now
she
said
he
swung
round
abruptly
upon
his
heel
and
paced
the
room
oh
yes
of
course
i
know
that
ralston
told
me
i
am
very
sorry
for
you
monck
very
very
sorry
thank
you
she
said
he
continued
to
tramp
to
and
fro
you
have
much
to
thank
me
for
i
had
to
think
of
the
regiment
but
i
considered
the
step
very
carefully
before
i
took
it
he
had
rendered
invaluable
service
especially
over
this
khanmulla
trial
he
would
have
been
decorated
for
it
if
he
pulled
up
with
a
jerk
if
things
had
been
different
i
know
sir
reginald
bassett
thought
very
highly
of
him
was
prepared
to
give
him
an
appointment
on
his
personal
staff
and
no
doubt
eventually
he
would
have
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
tree
but
this
affair
has
destroyed
him
he
paused
a
moment
but
he
did
not
look
at
her
he
has
had
every
chance
he
said
then
i
kept
an
open
mind
i
would
condemn
him
unheard
until
well
until
he
refused
flatly
to
speak
on
his
own
behalf
i
went
over
to
khanmulla
and
talked
to
him
talked
half
the
night
i
move
him
and
if
a
man
wo
take
the
trouble
to
defend
his
own
honour
it
is
worth
that
he
snapped
his
fingers
with
a
bitter
gesture
then
abruptly
wheeled
and
came
back
to
her
i
did
come
here
to
distress
you
he
said
looking
down
at
her
again
i
know
your
cup
is
full
already
and
it
a
thankless
task
to
persuade
any
woman
that
her
husband
is
unworthy
of
her
besides
being
an
impertinence
but
what
i
must
say
to
you
is
this
there
is
nothing
left
to
wait
for
and
it
would
be
sheer
madness
to
stay
on
any
longer
the
rajah
has
been
deeply
incriminated
and
is
in
hiding
the
government
will
of
course
take
over
the
direction
of
affairs
but
there
is
certain
absolutely
certain
to
be
a
disturbance
when
ermsted
murderer
is
executed
i
hope
an
adequate
force
will
soon
be
at
our
disposal
to
cope
with
it
but
it
has
not
yet
been
provided
therefore
i
can
not
possibly
permit
you
to
stay
here
any
longer
as
monck
wife
it
is
more
than
likely
that
you
might
be
made
an
object
of
vengeance
i
ca
risk
it
you
and
the
child
must
go
i
will
send
an
escort
in
the
morning
he
stopped
at
last
partly
for
lack
of
breath
partly
because
from
her
unmoved
expression
he
fancied
that
she
was
not
taking
in
his
warning
words
she
sat
looking
straight
before
her
as
one
rapt
in
reverie
it
was
almost
as
though
she
had
forgotten
him
suffered
some
more
absorbing
matter
to
crowd
him
out
of
her
thoughts
you
do
follow
me
he
questioned
at
length
as
she
did
not
speak
she
lifted
her
eyes
to
him
again
though
he
felt
it
was
with
a
great
effort
oh
yes
she
said
i
quite
understand
you
colonel
mansfield
and
i
am
quite
grateful
to
you
but
i
am
not
staying
here
for
my
husband
sake
at
all
i
do
not
suppose
we
shall
ever
see
each
other
any
more
all
that
is
over
he
started
what
you
have
given
him
up
he
said
uttering
the
words
almost
involuntarily
so
quiet
was
she
in
her
despair
she
bent
her
head
yes
i
have
given
him
up
i
do
not
know
where
he
is
or
anything
about
him
i
am
staying
here
now
i
must
stay
here
now
for
my
baby
sake
he
is
too
ill
to
bear
a
journey
she
lifted
her
face
again
with
the
words
and
in
its
pale
resolution
he
saw
that
he
would
spend
himself
upon
further
argument
in
vain
moreover
he
was
for
the
moment
too
staggered
by
the
information
to
concentrate
his
attention
upon
persuasion
her
utter
quietness
silenced
him
he
stood
for
a
moment
or
two
looking
down
at
her
then
abruptly
bent
and
took
her
hand
you
a
very
brave
woman
he
said
a
quick
touch
of
feeling
in
his
voice
you
had
a
fiendish
time
of
it
out
here
from
start
to
finish
it
be
a
good
thing
for
you
when
you
can
get
out
of
it
and
go
home
you
young
you
start
again
it
was
clumsy
consolation
but
his
was
fatherly
she
smiled
again
at
him
and
got
up
thank
you
very
much
colonel
you
have
always
been
kind
please
bother
about
me
any
more
i
am
really
not
a
bit
afraid
i
have
too
much
to
think
about
and
really
i
do
think
i
am
important
enough
to
be
in
any
real
danger
you
will
excuse
me
now
wo
you
i
have
just
got
a
new
and
they
always
need
superintending
perhaps
you
will
join
my
i
know
he
will
be
delighted
she
extricated
herself
with
a
gentle
aloofness
more
difficult
to
combat
than
any
open
opposition
and
he
went
away
to
express
himself
more
strongly
to
bernard
monck
from
whom
he
was
sure
at
least
of
receiving
sympathy
if
not
support
stella
returned
to
her
baby
with
a
stunned
feeling
of
having
been
struck
and
yet
without
consciousness
of
pain
perhaps
she
had
suffered
so
much
that
her
faculties
were
getting
numbed
she
knew
that
the
colonel
was
surprised
that
his
news
concerning
everard
had
affected
her
so
little
she
was
in
a
fashion
surprised
herself
was
she
then
so
absorbed
that
she
had
no
room
for
him
in
her
thoughts
and
yet
only
the
previous
night
how
she
had
yearned
for
him
it
was
the
end
of
everything
for
him
the
end
of
his
ambition
of
his
career
of
all
his
cherished
hopes
he
was
a
broken
man
and
he
would
drop
out
as
other
men
had
dropped
out
his
love
for
her
had
been
his
ruin
and
yet
her
brain
seemed
incapable
of
grasping
the
meaning
of
the
catastrophe
the
bearing
of
her
burden
occupied
the
whole
of
her
strength
the
rest
of
the
colonel
news
scarcely
touched
her
at
all
save
that
the
thought
flashed
upon
her
once
that
if
the
danger
were
indeed
so
great
everard
would
certainly
come
to
her
that
sent
a
strange
glow
through
her
that
died
as
swiftly
as
it
was
born
she
did
not
really
believe
in
the
danger
and
everard
was
probably
far
away
already
she
went
back
to
her
baby
and
the
hanani
over
whom
peter
was
mounting
guard
with
a
queer
mixture
of
patronage
and
respect
for
though
he
had
procured
the
woman
and
obviously
thought
highly
of
her
he
seemed
to
think
that
none
but
himself
could
be
regarded
as
fully
qualified
to
have
the
care
of
his
fondly
cherished
stella
heard
him
giving
some
directions
as
she
entered
and
she
wondered
if
the
new
would
resent
his
lordly
attitude
but
the
veiled
head
bent
over
the
child
expressed
nothing
but
complete
docility
she
answered
peter
in
few
words
but
with
the
utmost
meekness
her
quietness
was
a
great
relief
to
stella
there
was
a
about
it
that
gave
her
confidence
and
presently
tenderly
urged
by
peter
she
went
to
the
adjoining
room
to
rest
on
the
understanding
that
she
should
be
called
immediately
if
occasion
arose
and
that
was
the
first
night
of
many
that
she
passed
in
undisturbed
repose
in
the
early
morning
entering
she
found
peter
in
sole
possession
and
very
triumphant
they
had
divided
the
night
he
said
and
hanani
had
gone
to
rest
in
her
turn
all
had
gone
well
he
had
slept
on
the
threshold
and
knew
and
now
his
would
sleep
through
every
night
and
have
no
fear
she
smiled
at
his
solicitude
though
it
touched
her
almost
to
tears
and
gathered
in
silence
to
her
breast
the
little
frail
body
that
every
day
now
seemed
to
feel
lighter
and
smaller
it
would
not
be
for
very
long
their
planning
and
contriving
very
soon
now
she
would
be
free
quite
free
to
sleep
as
long
as
she
would
but
her
tired
heart
warmed
to
peter
and
to
that
silent
whom
he
had
enlisted
in
her
service
through
the
dark
night
of
her
grief
the
love
of
her
friends
shone
with
a
radiance
that
penetrated
even
the
deepest
shadows
was
this
the
lamp
in
the
desert
of
which
bernard
had
spoken
so
confidently
the
lamp
that
god
had
lighted
to
guide
her
halting
feet
was
it
by
this
that
she
would
come
at
last
into
the
presence
of
god
himself
and
realize
that
the
wanderers
in
the
wilderness
are
ever
his
especial
care
certainly
as
peter
had
intimated
she
knew
her
baby
to
be
safe
in
their
joint
charge
as
the
days
slipped
by
it
seemed
to
her
that
peter
had
imbued
the
with
something
of
his
own
devotion
for
though
it
was
proffered
almost
silently
she
was
aware
of
it
at
every
turn
at
any
other
time
her
sympathy
for
the
woman
would
have
fired
her
interest
and
led
her
to
attempt
to
draw
her
confidence
but
the
slender
thread
of
life
they
guarded
though
it
bound
them
with
a
tie
that
was
almost
friendship
seemed
so
to
fill
their
minds
that
they
never
spoke
of
anything
else
stella
knew
that
hanani
loved
her
and
considered
her
in
every
way
but
she
gave
peter
most
of
the
credit
for
it
peter
and
the
little
dying
baby
she
rocked
so
constantly
against
her
heart
she
knew
that
many
an
would
lay
down
her
life
for
her
charge
peter
had
chosen
well
later
when
this
time
of
waiting
and
watching
was
over
when
she
was
left
childless
and
alone
she
would
try
to
find
out
something
of
the
woman
history
help
her
if
she
could
reward
her
certainly
it
was
evident
that
she
was
growing
old
she
had
the
stoop
and
the
deliberation
of
age
probably
she
would
not
have
obtained
an
post
under
any
other
circumstances
but
notwithstanding
these
drawbacks
she
had
a
wonderful
endurance
and
she
was
never
startled
or
at
a
loss
stella
often
told
herself
that
she
would
not
have
exchanged
her
for
another
woman
even
a
white
woman
out
of
the
whole
of
india
had
the
chance
offered

chapter
vii
the
first
victim
an
ominous
calm
prevailed
at
khanmulla
during
the
week
that
followed
the
conviction
of
ermsted
murderer
and
the
disappearance
of
the
rajah
all
markestan
seemed
to
be
waiting
with
bated
breath
but
save
for
the
departure
of
the
women
from
kurrumpore
no
sign
was
given
by
the
government
of
any
expectation
of
a
disturbance
the
law
was
to
take
its
course
and
no
official
note
had
been
made
of
the
absence
of
the
rajah
he
had
always
been
sudden
in
his
movements
everything
went
as
usual
at
kurrumpore
and
no
one
nerves
seemed
to
feel
any
strain
even
tommy
betrayed
no
hint
of
irritation
a
new
manliness
had
come
upon
tommy
of
late
he
was
keeping
himself
in
hand
with
a
steadiness
which
even
bertie
oakes
could
not
ruffle
and
which
major
ralston
openly
approved
he
had
always
known
that
tommy
had
the
stuff
for
great
things
in
him
a
species
of
bickering
friendship
had
sprung
up
between
them
founded
upon
their
tacit
belief
in
the
honour
of
a
man
who
had
failed
they
seldom
mentioned
his
name
but
the
bond
of
sympathy
remained
oddly
tenacious
and
unassailable
tommy
strongly
suspected
moreover
that
ralston
knew
everard
whereabouts
and
of
this
even
bernard
was
ignorant
at
that
time
ralston
never
boasted
his
knowledge
but
the
conviction
had
somehow
taken
hold
of
tommy
and
for
this
reason
also
he
sought
the
surgeon
company
as
he
had
certainly
never
sought
it
before
ralston
on
his
part
was
kind
to
the
boy
partly
because
he
liked
him
and
admired
his
staunchness
and
partly
because
his
wife
unwilling
departure
had
left
him
lonely
he
and
major
burton
for
some
reason
were
not
so
friendly
as
of
yore
and
they
no
longer
spent
their
evenings
in
strict
seclusion
with
the
he
took
to
walking
back
from
the
mess
with
tommy
and
encouraged
the
latter
to
drop
in
at
his
bungalow
for
a
smoke
whenever
he
felt
inclined
it
was
but
a
short
distance
from
the
green
bungalow
and
as
he
was
wont
to
remark
it
was
one
degree
more
cheerful
for
which
consideration
tommy
was
profoundly
grateful
notwithstanding
bernard
kind
and
wholesome
presence
there
were
times
when
the
atmosphere
of
the
green
bungalow
was
almost
more
than
he
could
bear
he
was
powerless
to
help
and
the
long
misery
weighed
upon
him
unendurably
he
infinitely
preferred
smoking
a
silent
pipe
in
ralston
company
or
messing
about
with
him
in
his
little
surgery
as
he
was
sometimes
permitted
to
do
on
the
evening
before
the
day
fixed
for
the
execution
at
khanmulla
they
were
engaged
in
this
fashion
when
the
entered
with
the
news
that
a
desired
to
speak
to
him
oh
bother
said
ralston
crossly
who
is
it
do
you
know
the
man
hesitated
and
it
occurred
to
tommy
instantly
that
there
was
a
hint
of
mystery
in
his
manner
the
had
ridden
through
the
jungle
from
khanmulla
he
said
he
gave
no
name
confounded
fool
said
ralston
no
one
but
a
born
lunatic
would
do
a
thing
like
that
go
and
see
what
he
wants
like
a
good
chap
tommy
busy
tommy
rose
with
alacrity
his
curiosity
was
aroused
perhaps
monck
he
said
more
likely
barnes
said
ralston
only
i
should
have
thought
be
such
a
fool
keep
your
eyes
skinned
he
added
as
tommy
went
to
the
door
do
get
shot
or
stuck
by
anybody
if
i
really
wanted
come
tommy
grinned
at
the
caution
and
departed
he
had
ceased
to
anticipate
any
serious
trouble
in
the
state
and
nothing
really
exciting
ever
came
his
way
he
went
through
the
bungalow
to
the
still
half
expecting
to
find
his
awaiting
him
but
the
moment
he
entered
he
had
a
shock
a
man
in
a
rough
tweed
coat
was
sitting
at
the
table
in
an
odd
hunched
attitude
almost
as
if
he
had
fallen
into
the
chair
that
supported
him
he
turned
his
head
a
little
at
tommy
entrance
but
not
so
that
the
light
revealed
his
face
hullo
he
said
that
you
ralston
i
got
a
bullet
in
my
left
shoulder
do
you
mind
getting
it
out
tommy
stopped
dead
he
felt
as
if
his
heart
stopped
also
he
knew
surely
he
knew
that
voice
but
it
was
not
that
of
everard
or
barnes
or
of
any
one
he
had
ever
expected
to
meet
again
on
earth
what
what
he
gasped
feebly
and
went
backwards
against
the
am
i
drunk
he
questioned
with
himself
the
man
in
the
chair
turned
more
fully
why
it
tommy
he
said
the
light
smote
full
upon
him
now
throwing
up
every
detail
of
a
countenance
which
though
handsome
had
begun
to
show
unmistakable
signs
of
coarse
and
intemperate
habits
he
laughed
as
he
met
the
boy
shocked
eyes
but
the
laugh
caught
in
his
throat
and
turned
to
a
strangled
oath
then
he
began
to
cough
oh
my
god
said
tommy
he
turned
then
horror
urging
him
and
tore
back
to
ralston
as
one
pursued
by
devils
he
burst
in
upon
him
headlong
for
heaven
sake
come
that
fellow
it
it
who
said
ralston
sharply
i
do
know
panted
back
tommy
i
mad
i
think
but
come
for
goodness
sake
before
he
bleeds
to
death
ralston
came
with
a
velocity
which
exceeded
even
tommy
wild
rush
tommy
marvelled
at
it
later
he
had
not
thought
the
phlegmatic
and
ralston
had
it
in
him
he
himself
was
left
well
behind
and
when
he
the
ralston
was
already
bending
over
the
huddled
figure
that
sprawled
across
the
table
come
and
lend
a
hand
he
ordered
we
must
get
him
on
the
floor
poor
devil
he
got
it
pretty
straight
he
had
not
seen
the
stricken
man
face
he
was
too
concerned
with
the
wound
to
worry
about
any
minor
details
for
the
moment
tommy
helped
him
to
the
best
of
his
ability
but
he
was
trembling
so
much
that
in
a
second
ralston
swooped
scathingly
upon
his
weakness
steady
man
pull
yourself
together
what
on
earth
the
matter
never
seen
a
little
blood
before
if
you
faint
i
i
kick
you
there
tommy
pulled
himself
together
forthwith
he
had
never
before
submitted
to
being
bullied
by
ralston
but
he
submitted
then
for
speech
was
beyond
him
they
lowered
the
big
frame
between
them
and
at
command
he
supported
it
while
the
doctor
made
a
swift
examination
of
the
injury
then
while
this
was
in
progress
the
wounded
man
recovered
his
senses
and
forced
a
few
husky
words
hullo
ralston
have
they
done
me
in
ralston
eyes
went
to
his
face
for
the
first
time
shot
a
momentary
glance
at
tommy
and
returned
to
the
matter
in
hand
do
talk
he
said
a
few
seconds
later
he
got
to
his
feet
keep
him
just
as
he
is
i
must
go
and
fetch
something
do
let
him
speak
he
was
gone
with
the
words
and
tommy
still
feeling
bewildered
and
rather
sick
knelt
in
silence
and
waited
for
his
return
but
almost
immediately
the
husky
voice
spoke
again
tommy
that
you
tommy
felt
himself
begin
to
tremble
again
and
put
forth
all
his
strength
to
keep
himself
in
hand
do
talk
he
said
gruffly
i
got
to
talk
the
words
came
forced
by
angry
obstinacy
no
damnation
good
i
done
for
beaten
on
the
straight
and
that
hell
hound
monck
damn
you
be
quiet
said
tommy
in
a
furious
undertone
i
wo
be
quiet
i
have
my
turn
such
as
it
is
where
stella
fetch
stella
i
a
right
to
that
anyway
she
is
my
lawful
wife
i
ca
fetch
her
said
tommy
all
right
then
you
can
tell
her
from
me
that
she
been
duped
as
i
was
she
mine
not
his
he
came
with
that
story
about
the
other
woman
but
she
was
dead
i
found
out
since
she
was
dead
and
he
knew
it
he
faked
up
the
tale
to
suit
himself
he
wanted
her
the
damn
skunk
wanted
her
and
cheated
cheated
to
get
her
he
stopped
checked
by
a
terrible
gurgle
in
the
throat
tommy
white
with
passion
broke
fiercely
into
his
gasping
silence
it
a
damned
lie
monck
is
a
white
man
he
never
did
a
thing
like
that
and
then
he
too
stopped
in
sheer
horror
at
the
devilish
hatred
that
gleamed
in
the
rolling
bloodshot
eyes
a
few
dreadful
seconds
passed
then
ralph
dacre
gathered
his
ebbing
life
in
one
last
great
effort
of
speech
she
is
my
wife
i
hold
the
proof
if
it
had
been
for
this
i
have
taken
her
from
him
he
ruined
me
and
he
robbed
me
but
i
i
ruin
him
now
it
my
turn
he
is
not
her
husband
and
she
she
scorn
him
after
this
if
i
know
her
consoled
herself
precious
soon
yes
women
are
like
that
but
they
do
forgive
so
easily
and
she
is
not
the
forgiving
sort
anyway
she
never
forgive
him
for
tricking
her
the
hound
she
never
forget
that
the
child
her
child
is
a
bastard
and
the
regiment
forget
either
he
down
and
out
he
ceased
to
speak
tommy
hands
were
clenched
if
the
man
had
been
on
his
feet
he
would
have
struck
him
on
the
mouth
as
it
was
he
could
only
kneel
in
impotence
and
listen
to
the
amazing
utterance
that
fell
from
the
gasping
lips
he
felt
stunned
into
passivity
his
anger
had
strangely
sunk
away
though
he
regarded
the
man
he
supported
with
such
an
intensity
of
loathing
that
he
marvelled
at
himself
for
continuing
to
endure
the
contact
the
astounding
revelation
had
struck
him
like
a
blow
between
the
eyes
he
felt
numb
almost
incapable
of
thought
he
heard
ralston
returning
and
wondered
what
he
could
have
been
doing
in
that
interminable
interval
then
reluctant
but
horribly
fascinated
his
look
went
back
to
the
upturned
dreadful
face
the
malignancy
had
gone
out
of
it
the
eyes
rolled
no
longer
but
gazed
with
a
great
fixity
at
something
that
seemed
to
be
infinitely
far
away
as
tommy
looked
a
terrible
rattling
breath
went
through
the
heavy
inert
form
it
seemed
to
rend
body
and
soul
asunder
there
followed
a
brief
palpitating
shudder
and
the
head
on
his
arm
sank
sideways
a
great
stillness
fell
ralston
knelt
and
freed
him
from
his
burden
get
up
he
said
tommy
obeyed
though
he
felt
more
like
collapsing
he
leaned
upon
the
table
and
stared
while
ralston
laid
the
big
frame
flat
and
straight
upon
the
floor
is
he
dead
he
asked
in
a
whisper
as
ralston
stood
up
yes
said
ralston
it
was
my
fault
was
it
said
tommy
uneasily
i
could
stop
him
talking
he
have
died
anyhow
said
ralston
it
a
wonder
he
ever
got
here
if
he
was
shot
in
the
jungle
as
he
must
have
been
that
means
probably
that
the
brutes
have
started
their
games
odd
if
he
should
be
the
first
victim
tommy
shuddered
uncontrollably
ralston
gripped
his
arm
do
be
a
fool
now
death
is
nothing
extraordinary
after
all
it
an
experience
we
all
got
to
go
through
some
time
or
other
it
does
scare
me
it
wo
you
when
you
a
bit
older
as
for
this
fellow
it
about
the
best
thing
that
could
happen
for
everyone
concerned
just
rememer
that
providence
works
pretty
near
the
surface
at
times
and
this
is
one
of
you
wo
believe
me
i
daresay
but
i
never
really
felt
that
ralph
dacre
was
dead
until
this
moment
he
led
tommy
from
the
room
with
the
words
it
was
not
his
custom
to
express
himself
so
freely
but
he
wanted
to
get
that
look
out
of
the
boy
eyes
he
talked
to
give
him
time
and
now
look
here
he
said
you
got
to
keep
your
head
for
want
it
i
give
you
something
to
steady
you
and
after
that
you
be
on
your
own
you
must
cut
back
to
the
green
bungalow
and
find
bernard
monck
and
tell
him
just
what
has
happened
no
one
else
mind
until
you
seen
him
he
discreet
enough
i
going
round
to
the
colonel
for
if
what
i
think
has
happened
those
devils
are
ahead
of
us
by
hours
and
we
not
ready
for
they
probably
cut
the
wires
too
when
you
done
that
you
report
down
at
the
barracks
your
sister
will
probably
have
to
be
taken
there
for
safety
and
there
may
be
some
tough
work
before
morning
these
last
words
of
his
had
a
magical
effect
upon
tommy
his
eyes
suddenly
shone
ralston
had
accomplished
his
purpose
nevertheless
he
took
him
back
to
the
surgery
and
made
him
swallow
some
in
spite
of
protest
and
now
you
wo
be
a
fool
will
you
he
said
at
parting
i
should
be
sorry
if
you
got
shot
to
no
purpose
monck
would
be
sorry
too
do
you
know
where
he
is
questioned
tommy
yes
blunt
and
uncompromising
came
ralston
reply
but
i
not
going
to
tell
you
so
do
you
worry
yourself
you
stick
to
business
tommy
and
for
heaven
sake
do
go
round
and
make
a
mush
of
it
stick
to
business
yourself
said
tommy
rudely
suddenly
awaking
to
the
fact
that
he
was
being
dictated
to
then
pulled
up
faintly
grinning
sorry
i
did
mean
that
you
a
brick
consider
it
unsaid
he
held
out
his
hand
to
ralston
who
took
it
and
thumped
him
on
the
back
by
way
of
acknowledgment
you
growing
up
he
remarked
with
approval
as
tommy
went
his
way
chapter
viii
the
fiery
vortex
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
done
said
peter
with
mournful
eyes
upon
the
baby
in
the
arms
will
not
my
take
her
rest
stella
eyes
also
rested
upon
the
tiny
wizen
face
she
knew
that
peter
spoke
truly
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
done
she
might
send
yet
again
for
major
ralston
but
of
what
avail
he
had
told
her
that
he
could
do
no
more
the
little
life
was
slipping
swiftly
swiftly
out
of
her
reach
very
soon
only
the
desert
emptiness
would
be
left
the
may
trust
her
to
hanani
murmured
the
behind
the
enveloping
veil
hanani
loves
the
too
oh
i
know
stella
said
yet
she
hung
over
the
shoulder
for
of
all
nights
she
somehow
felt
that
she
could
not
tear
herself
away
there
had
been
a
change
during
the
day
a
change
so
gradual
as
to
be
almost
imperceptible
save
to
her
yearning
eyes
she
was
certain
that
the
baby
was
weaker
he
had
cried
less
had
she
believed
suffered
less
and
now
he
lay
quite
passive
in
the
arms
only
by
the
feeble
fluttering
breath
that
came
and
went
so
fitfully
could
she
have
told
that
the
tiny
spark
yet
lingered
in
the
poor
little
wasted
frame
major
ralston
had
told
her
earlier
in
the
evening
that
he
might
go
on
in
this
state
for
days
but
she
did
not
think
it
probable
she
was
sure
that
every
hour
now
brought
an
infinitesimal
difference
she
felt
that
the
end
was
drawing
near
and
so
a
great
reluctance
to
go
possessed
her
even
though
she
would
be
within
call
all
night
she
had
a
hungry
longing
to
stay
and
watch
the
little
unconscious
face
which
would
soon
be
gone
from
her
sight
she
wanted
to
hold
each
minute
of
the
few
hours
left
very
softly
peter
came
to
her
side
my
will
rest
he
said
wistfully
she
looked
at
him
his
faithful
eyes
besought
her
like
the
eyes
of
a
dog
their
dumb
adoration
somehow
made
her
want
to
cry
if
i
could
only
stay
peter
she
said
he
urged
very
pleadingly
the
sleeps
now
it
may
be
he
will
want
you
and
if
my
has
not
slept
she
will
be
too
weary
then
again
she
knew
that
he
spoke
the
truth
there
had
been
times
of
late
when
she
had
been
made
aware
of
the
fact
that
her
strength
was
nearing
its
limit
she
knew
it
would
be
sheer
madness
to
neglect
the
warning
lest
as
peter
suggested
her
baby
need
of
her
outlasted
her
endurance
she
must
husband
all
the
strength
she
had
with
a
sigh
she
bent
and
touched
the
tiny
forehead
with
her
lips
hanani
hand
long
and
bony
gently
stroked
her
arm
as
she
did
so
old
hanani
knows
she
whispered
under
her
breath
the
tears
she
had
barely
checked
a
moment
before
sprang
to
eyes
she
held
the
dark
hand
in
silence
and
was
subtly
comforted
thereby
passing
through
the
door
that
peter
held
open
for
her
she
gave
him
her
hand
also
he
bent
very
low
over
it
just
as
he
had
bent
on
that
first
of
hers
so
long
so
long
ago
and
touched
it
with
his
forehead
the
memory
flashed
back
upon
her
oddly
she
heard
again
ralph
dacre
voice
speaking
in
her
ear
you
stella
you
are
as
ageless
as
the
stars
the
pride
and
the
passion
of
his
tones
stabbed
through
her
with
a
curious
poignancy
strange
that
the
thought
of
him
should
come
to
her
with
such
vividness
she
passed
on
to
her
room
as
one
moving
in
a
painful
trance
for
a
space
she
lingered
there
hardly
knowing
what
she
did
then
she
remembered
that
she
had
not
bidden
bernard
and
mechanically
her
steps
turned
in
his
direction
he
was
generally
smoking
and
working
on
the
verandah
at
that
hour
she
made
her
way
to
the
as
being
the
nearest
approach
but
across
the
room
the
sound
of
tommy
voice
sharp
and
agitated
came
to
her
involuntarily
she
paused
he
was
with
bernard
on
the
verandah
the
devils
shot
him
in
the
jungle
but
he
came
on
got
as
far
as
ralston
bungalow
and
collapsed
there
he
was
dead
in
a
few
minutes
before
anything
could
be
done
the
words
pierced
through
her
trance
like
a
naked
sword
flashing
with
incredible
swiftness
cutting
asunder
every
bond
every
fibre
that
held
her
soul
confined
she
sprang
for
the
open
window
with
a
great
and
terrible
cry
who
is
dead
who
who
the
red
glare
of
the
lamp
met
her
dazzled
her
seemed
to
enter
her
brain
and
cruelly
to
burn
her
but
she
did
not
heed
it
she
stood
with
arms
flung
wide
in
frantic
supplication
everard
she
cried
oh
god
my
god
not
everard
her
wild
words
pierced
the
night
and
all
the
voices
of
india
seemed
to
answer
her
in
a
mad
discordant
jangle
of
unintelligible
sound
an
owl
hooted
a
jackal
yelped
and
a
chorus
of
savage
yelling
laughter
broke
hideously
across
the
clamour
swallowing
it
as
a
greater
wave
swallows
a
lesser
overwhelming
all
that
has
gone
before
the
red
glare
of
the
lamp
vanished
from
stella
brain
leaving
an
awful
blankness
a
sense
as
of
something
burnt
out
a
taste
of
ashes
in
the
mouth
but
yet
the
darkness
was
full
of
horrors
unseen
monsters
leaped
past
her
as
in
a
surging
torrent
devils
hands
clawed
at
her
mouths
cried
unspeakable
things
she
stood
as
it
were
on
the
edge
of
the
vortex
untouched
unafraid
beyond
it
all
since
that
awful
devouring
flame
had
flared
and
gone
out
she
even
wondered
if
it
had
killed
her
so
terribly
aloof
was
she
so
totally
distinct
from
the
pandemonium
that
raged
around
her
it
had
the
vividness
and
the
curious
lack
of
all
physical
feeling
of
a
nightmare
and
yet
through
all
her
numbness
she
knew
that
she
was
waiting
for
someone
someone
who
was
dead
like
herself
she
had
not
seen
either
bernard
or
tommy
in
that
blinding
moment
on
the
verandah
doubtless
they
were
fighting
in
that
raging
blackness
in
front
of
her
she
fancied
once
that
she
heard
her
brother
voice
laughing
as
she
had
sometimes
heard
him
laugh
on
the
when
he
had
executed
a
difficult
stroke
immediately
before
her
a
titanic
struggle
was
going
on
she
could
not
see
it
for
the
light
in
the
room
behind
had
been
extinguished
also
but
the
dreadful
sound
of
it
made
her
think
for
a
fleeting
second
of
a
great
being
pulled
down
by
a
score
of
leaping
hounds
and
then
very
suddenly
she
herself
was
caught
caught
from
behind
dragged
backwards
off
her
feet
she
cried
out
in
a
wild
horror
but
in
a
second
she
was
silenced
some
thick
material
that
had
a
heavy
native
scent
about
it
such
a
scent
as
she
remembered
vaguely
to
hang
about
hanani
the
was
thrust
over
her
face
and
head
muffling
all
outcry
muscular
arms
gripped
her
with
a
fierce
and
ruthless
mastery
and
as
they
lifted
and
bore
her
away
the
nightmare
was
blotted
from
her
brain
as
if
it
had
never
been
she
sank
into
oblivion
chapter
ix
the
desert
of
ashes
was
it
night
was
it
morning
she
could
not
tell
she
opened
her
eyes
to
a
weird
and
incomprehensible
twilight
to
the
gurgling
sound
of
water
the
booming
croak
of
a
frog
at
first
she
thought
that
she
was
dreaming
that
presently
these
vague
impressions
would
fade
from
her
consciousness
and
she
would
awake
to
normal
things
to
the
sunlight
beating
across
the
verandah
to
the
cheery
call
of
everard
in
the
compound
and
the
tramp
of
impatient
hoofs
and
everard
himself
would
rise
up
from
her
side
and
stoop
and
kiss
her
before
he
went
she
began
to
wait
for
his
kiss
first
in
genuine
expectation
later
with
a
tricking
of
the
imagination
never
once
had
he
left
her
without
that
kiss
but
she
waited
in
vain
and
as
she
waited
the
current
of
her
thoughts
grew
gradually
clearer
she
began
to
remember
the
happenings
of
the
night
it
dawned
upon
her
slowly
and
terribly
that
everard
was
dead
when
that
memory
came
to
her
her
brain
seemed
to
stand
still
there
was
no
passing
on
from
that
everard
had
been
shot
in
the
jungle
just
as
she
had
always
known
he
would
be
he
had
ridden
on
in
spite
of
it
she
pictured
his
grim
endurance
with
shrinking
vividness
he
had
ridden
on
to
major
ralston
bungalow
and
had
collapsed
there
collapsed
and
died
before
they
could
help
him
clearly
before
her
inner
vision
rose
the
scene
everard
sinking
down
broken
and
inert
all
the
indomitable
strength
of
him
shattered
at
last
the
steady
courage
quenched
yet
what
was
it
he
had
once
said
to
her
it
rushed
across
her
now
words
he
had
uttered
long
ago
on
the
night
he
had
taken
her
to
the
ruined
temple
at
khanmulla
my
love
is
not
the
kind
that
burns
and
goes
out
she
remembered
the
exact
words
the
quiver
in
the
voice
that
had
uttered
them
then
that
being
so
he
was
loving
her
still
across
the
desert
her
bitter
desert
of
ashes
the
lamp
was
shining
even
now
love
like
his
was
immortal
love
such
as
that
could
never
die
that
comforted
her
for
a
space
but
soon
the
sense
of
desolation
returned
she
remembered
their
cruel
estrangement
she
remembered
their
child
and
that
last
thought
entering
like
an
electric
force
gave
her
strength
surely
it
was
morning
and
he
would
be
needing
her
had
not
peter
said
he
would
want
her
in
the
morning
with
a
sharp
effort
she
raised
herself
she
must
go
to
him
the
next
moment
a
sharp
breath
of
amazement
escaped
her
where
was
she
the
strange
twilight
stretched
up
above
her
into
infinite
shadow
before
her
was
a
broken
archway
through
which
vaguely
she
saw
the
heavy
foliage
of
trees
behind
her
she
yet
heard
the
splash
and
gurgle
of
water
the
croaking
of
frogs
and
near
at
hand
some
tiny
creature
scratched
and
scuffled
among
loose
stones
she
sat
staring
about
her
doubting
the
evidence
of
her
senses
marvelling
if
it
could
all
be
a
dream
for
she
recognized
the
place
it
was
the
ruined
temple
of
khanmulla
in
which
she
sat
there
were
the
crumbling
steps
on
which
she
had
stood
with
everard
on
the
night
that
he
had
mercilessly
claimed
her
love
had
taken
her
in
his
arms
and
said
that
it
was
kismet
it
was
then
that
like
a
the
realization
of
his
loss
went
through
her
it
was
then
that
she
first
tasted
the
hopeless
anguish
of
loneliness
that
awaited
her
saw
the
long
long
desert
track
stretching
out
before
her
leading
she
knew
not
whither
she
bowed
her
head
upon
her
arms
and
sat
crushed
unconscious
of
all
beside
it
must
have
been
some
time
later
that
there
fell
a
soft
step
beside
her
a
veiled
figure
bent
and
slow
of
movement
stooped
over
her
a
low
voice
said
she
looked
up
startled
and
wondering
hanani
she
said
yes
it
is
hanani
the
woman
husky
whisper
came
reassuringly
in
answer
have
no
fear
you
are
safe
here
what
happened
questioned
stella
still
the
evidence
of
her
senses
where
where
is
my
baby
hanani
knelt
down
by
her
side
she
said
very
gently
the
sleeps
in
the
keeping
of
god
it
was
tenderly
spoken
so
tenderly
that
it
came
to
her
afterwards
she
received
the
news
with
no
sense
of
shock
she
even
felt
as
if
she
must
have
somehow
known
it
before
in
the
utter
greyness
of
her
desert
she
had
walked
alone
he
is
dead
she
said
not
dead
corrected
the
gently
she
paused
a
moment
then
in
the
same
hushed
voice
that
was
scarcely
more
than
a
whisper
he
passed
in
these
arms
so
easily
so
gently
i
knew
not
when
the
last
breath
came
you
had
been
gone
but
a
little
space
i
sent
peter
to
call
you
but
your
room
was
empty
he
returned
and
i
went
to
seek
you
myself
i
reached
you
only
as
the
storm
broke
ah
a
sharp
shudder
caught
stella
what
happened
she
asked
again
it
was
but
a
band
of
a
note
of
contempt
sounded
in
the
quiet
rejoinder
i
think
they
were
looking
for
monck
for
the
captain
but
they
found
him
not
no
stella
said
no
they
had
killed
him
already
in
the
jungle
at
least
they
had
shot
him
he
died
afterwards
she
spoke
dully
she
felt
as
if
her
heart
had
grown
old
within
her
too
old
to
feel
poignantly
any
more
go
on
she
said
after
a
moment
what
happened
then
did
they
kill
bernard
and
denvers
too
neither
my
hanani
reply
was
prompt
and
confident
bernard
was
struck
on
the
head
and
senseless
when
we
dragged
him
in
denvers
was
not
touched
it
was
he
who
put
out
the
lamp
and
saved
their
lives
afterwards
i
know
not
how
he
raised
a
great
outcry
so
that
they
thought
they
were
surrounded
and
fled
truly
denvers
is
great
after
that
he
went
for
help
and
i
fearing
they
might
return
to
visit
their
vengeance
upon
you
being
the
wife
of
the
captain
whom
they
could
not
find
i
wrapped
a
about
your
head
and
carried
you
away
humble
pride
in
the
achievement
sounded
in
hanani
voice
i
knew
that
here
you
would
be
safe
she
ended
all
fear
this
place
it
is
said
to
be
the
abode
of
unquiet
spirits
again
stella
gazed
around
the
place
her
eyes
had
become
accustomed
to
the
twilight
the
crumbling
walls
stretched
away
into
darkness
behind
her
but
the
place
held
no
terrors
for
her
she
was
too
tired
to
be
afraid
she
only
wondered
though
without
much
interest
how
hanani
had
managed
to
accomplish
the
journey
where
is
peter
she
asked
at
last
peter
remained
with
bernard
hanani
answered
he
will
tell
them
where
to
seek
for
you
again
stella
gazed
about
the
place
it
struck
her
as
strange
that
peter
should
have
relinquished
his
guardianship
of
her
even
in
favour
of
hanani
but
the
thought
did
not
hold
her
for
long
evidently
he
had
known
that
he
could
trust
the
woman
as
he
trusted
himself
and
her
strength
must
be
almost
superhuman
she
was
glad
that
he
had
stayed
behind
with
bernard
she
leaned
her
chin
upon
her
hands
and
sat
silent
for
a
space
but
gradually
as
she
reviewed
the
situation
curiosity
began
to
struggle
through
her
lethargy
she
looked
at
hanani
crouched
humbly
beside
her
looked
at
her
again
and
again
and
at
last
her
wonder
found
vent
in
speech
hanani
she
said
i
do
quite
understand
everything
how
did
you
get
me
here
hanani
veiled
head
was
bent
she
turned
it
towards
her
slowly
almost
reluctantly
it
seemed
to
stella
i
carried
you
she
said
you
carried
me
stella
repeated
the
word
incredulously
but
it
is
a
long
way
a
very
long
way
from
kurrumpore
hanani
was
silent
for
a
moment
or
two
as
though
irresolute
then
i
brought
you
by
a
way
unknown
to
you
she
said
hafiz
you
know
hafiz
he
helped
me
hafiz
stella
frowned
a
little
yes
by
sight
she
knew
him
well
hafiz
the
crafty
was
her
private
name
for
him
how
did
he
help
you
she
asked
again
hanani
seemed
to
hesitate
as
one
reluctant
to
give
away
a
secret
from
the
shop
of
hafiz
that
is
the
shop
of
rustam
karin
in
the
bazaar
she
said
at
length
and
stella
quivered
at
the
name
there
is
a
passage
that
leads
under
the
ground
into
the
jungle
to
those
who
know
the
way
is
easy
it
was
thus
that
i
brought
you
hither
but
how
did
you
get
me
to
the
bazaar
questioned
stella
still
hardly
believing
it
was
very
dark
and
the
were
scattered
they
would
not
touch
an
old
woman
such
as
hanani
and
you
my
were
wrapped
in
a
with
old
hanani
you
were
safe
ah
why
should
you
take
all
that
trouble
to
save
my
life
stella
said
a
little
quiver
of
passion
in
her
voice
do
you
think
life
is
so
precious
to
me
now
hanani
made
a
protesting
gesture
with
one
arm
lo
it
is
yet
night
she
said
but
is
it
not
written
in
the
sacred
book
that
with
the
dawn
comes
joy
there
can
never
be
any
joy
for
me
again
stella
said
hanani
leaned
slowly
forward
then
will
my
have
missed
the
meaning
of
life
she
said
listen
then
listen
to
old
hanani
who
knows
it
is
true
that
the
can
not
return
to
the
but
would
she
call
him
back
to
pain
have
i
not
read
in
her
eyes
night
after
night
the
silent
prayer
that
he
might
go
in
peace
now
that
the
god
of
gods
has
answered
that
prayer
now
that
the
is
in
peace
would
my
have
it
otherwise
would
she
call
that
loved
one
back
would
she
not
rather
thank
the
god
of
spirits
for
his
great
mercy
and
so
go
her
way
rejoicing
again
the
utterance
was
too
full
of
tenderness
to
give
her
pain
it
sank
deep
into
stella
heart
stilling
for
a
space
the
anguish
she
looked
at
the
strange
draped
figure
beside
her
that
spoke
those
husky
words
of
comfort
with
a
dawning
sense
of
reverence
she
had
a
curious
feeling
as
of
one
being
guided
through
a
holy
place
you
comfort
me
hanani
she
said
after
a
moment
i
do
think
i
am
really
grieving
for
the
yet
that
will
come
after
i
know
that
as
you
say
he
is
at
peace
and
i
would
not
call
him
back
but
hanani
that
is
not
all
it
is
not
even
the
half
or
the
beginning
of
my
trouble
the
loss
of
my
i
can
bear
i
could
bear
bravely
but
the
loss
of
of
words
failed
her
unexpectedly
she
bowed
her
head
again
upon
her
arms
and
wept
the
bitter
tears
of
despair
hanani
the
sat
very
still
by
her
side
her
brown
bony
hands
tightly
gripped
about
her
knees
her
veiled
head
bent
slightly
forward
as
though
she
watched
for
someone
in
the
dimness
of
the
broken
archway
at
last
very
very
slowly
she
spoke
even
in
the
desert
the
sun
rises
there
is
always
comfort
for
those
who
go
forward
even
though
they
mourn
not
for
me
sobbed
stella
not
for
those
who
part
in
bitterness
and
never
meet
again
never
hanani
yet
gazed
straight
before
her
suddenly
she
made
a
movement
as
if
to
rise
but
checked
herself
as
one
reminded
by
exertion
of
physical
infirmity
the
weeps
for
her
lord
she
said
how
shall
hanani
comfort
her
yet
never
is
a
cruel
word
may
it
not
be
that
he
will
even
now
return
he
is
dead
whispered
stella
not
so
very
gently
hanani
corrected
her
the
captain
lives
he
lives
stella
started
upright
with
the
words
in
the
gloom
her
eyes
shone
with
a
sudden
feverish
light
but
it
very
swiftly
died
ah
do
torture
me
hanani
she
said
you
mean
well
but
it
help
hanani
speaks
the
truth
protested
the
old
and
behind
the
enveloping
veil
came
an
answering
gleam
as
if
she
smiled
my
lord
the
captain
spoke
with
hafiz
this
very
night
hafiz
will
tell
the
but
stella
shook
her
head
in
hopeless
unbelief
i
do
trust
hafiz
she
said
wearily
yet
hafiz
would
not
lie
to
old
hanani
insisted
the
in
that
soft
insinuating
whisper
of
hers
stella
reached
out
a
trembling
hand
and
laid
it
upon
her
shoulder
listen
hanani
she
said
i
have
never
seen
your
face
yet
i
know
you
for
a
friend
ask
not
to
see
it
swiftly
interposed
the
lest
you
turn
with
loathing
from
one
who
loves
you
stella
smiled
a
quivering
piteous
smile
i
should
never
do
that
hanani
she
said
but
i
do
not
need
to
see
it
i
know
you
love
me
but
do
not
out
of
your
love
for
me
tell
me
a
lie
it
is
false
comfort
it
can
not
help
me
but
i
have
not
lied
there
was
earnest
assurance
in
hanani
voice
such
assurance
as
could
not
be
disregarded
i
have
told
you
the
truth
the
captain
is
not
dead
it
was
a
false
report
hanani
are
you
sure
stella
hand
gripped
the
shoulder
with
convulsive
strength
then
who
who
was
the
they
shot
in
the
jungle
the
who
died
at
the
bungalow
of
ralston
did
hafiz
tell
you
that
that
said
hanani
and
paused
as
if
considering
how
best
to
present
the
information
that
was
another
another
stella
was
trembling
violently
her
hold
upon
hanani
was
the
clutch
of
desperation
who
what
was
his
name
she
felt
in
the
momentary
pause
that
followed
that
the
eyes
behind
the
veil
were
looking
at
her
strangely
speculatively
then
very
softly
hanani
answered
her
his
name
was
dacre
dacre
stella
repeated
the
name
blankly
it
seemed
to
hold
too
great
a
meaning
for
her
to
grasp
so
hafiz
told
hanani
said
the
but
dacre
stella
hung
upon
the
name
as
if
it
held
her
by
a
fascination
from
which
she
could
not
shake
free
is
that
all
you
know
she
said
at
last
not
all
my
answered
hanani
in
the
soothing
tone
of
one
who
instructs
a
child
hafiz
knew
the
in
the
days
before
hanani
came
to
kurrumpore
hafiz
told
a
strange
story
of
the
he
had
married
and
had
taken
his
wife
to
the
mountains
beyond
srinagar
and
there
an
evil
fate
had
overtaken
him
and
she
the
had
returned
alone
hanani
paused
dramatically
go
on
gasped
stella
almost
inarticulately
hanani
took
up
her
tale
again
in
a
mysterious
whisper
that
crept
in
eerie
echoes
about
the
ruined
place
in
which
they
sat
hafiz
said
that
there
was
doubtless
a
reason
for
which
he
feigned
death
he
said
that
dacre
was
a
bad
man
and
my
lord
the
captain
knew
it
wherefore
he
followed
him
to
the
mountains
and
commanded
him
to
be
gone
and
thus
he
went
but
who
told
hafiz
questioned
stella
still
struggling
against
unbelief
how
should
hanani
know
murmured
the
deprecatingly
hafiz
lives
in
the
bazaar
he
hears
many
things
some
true
some
false
but
that
dacre
returned
last
night
and
that
he
now
is
dead
is
true
and
that
my
lord
the
captain
lives
is
also
true
hanani
swears
it
by
her
grey
hairs
then
where
where
is
the
captain
whispered
stella
the
shook
her
head
it
is
not
given
to
hanani
to
know
all
things
she
protested
but
she
can
find
out
does
the
desire
her
to
find
out
yes
stella
breathed
the
fantastic
tale
was
running
like
a
mad
tarantella
through
her
brain
her
thoughts
were
in
a
whirl
but
she
clung
to
the
thought
of
everard
as
a
shipwrecked
mariner
clings
to
a
rock
he
yet
lived
he
had
not
passed
out
of
her
reach
it
might
be
he
was
even
then
at
khanmulla
a
few
short
miles
away
all
her
doubt
of
him
all
evil
suspicions
vanished
in
a
great
and
overwhelming
longing
for
his
presence
it
suddenly
came
to
her
that
she
had
wronged
him
and
before
that
unquestionable
conviction
the
story
of
ralph
dacre
return
was
dwarfed
to
utter
insignificance
what
was
ralph
dacre
to
her
she
had
travelled
far
oh
very
far
through
the
desert
since
the
days
of
that
strange
dream
in
the
himalayas
living
or
dead
surely
he
had
no
claim
upon
her
now
impulsively
she
stooped
towards
hanani
take
me
to
him
she
said
take
me
to
him
i
am
sure
you
know
where
he
is
hanani
drew
back
slightly
it
will
take
time
to
find
him
she
remonstrated
hanani
is
not
a
young
woman
moreover
she
stopped
suddenly
and
turned
her
head
what
is
it
said
stella
i
heard
a
sound
hanani
rose
slowly
to
her
feet
it
seemed
to
stella
that
she
was
more
bent
more
deliberate
of
movement
than
usual
doubtless
the
wild
adventure
of
the
night
had
told
upon
her
she
watched
her
with
a
tinge
of
compunction
as
she
made
her
somewhat
difficult
way
towards
the
archway
at
the
top
of
the
broken
marble
steps
a
flapped
eerily
past
her
as
she
went
dipping
over
the
bent
veiled
head
with
as
little
fear
as
if
she
were
a
recognized
inhabitant
of
that
wild
place
a
sharp
sense
of
unreality
stabbed
stella
she
felt
as
one
coming
out
of
an
dream
obeying
an
instinctive
impulse
she
rose
up
quickly
to
follow
but
even
as
she
did
so
two
things
happened
hanani
passed
like
a
shadow
from
her
sight
and
a
voice
she
knew
tommy
voice
somewhat
and
anxious
called
her
name
swiftly
she
moved
to
meet
him
i
am
here
tommy
i
am
here
and
then
she
tottered
feeling
her
strength
begin
to
fail
oh
tommy
she
gasped
help
me
he
sprang
up
the
steps
and
caught
her
in
his
arms
you
hang
on
to
me
he
said
i
got
you
she
leaned
upon
him
quivering
with
closed
eyes
i
am
afraid
i
must
she
said
weakly
forgive
me
for
being
so
stupid
all
right
darling
all
right
he
said
you
not
hurt
no
oh
no
only
giddy
stupid
she
fought
desperately
for
i
shall
be
all
right
in
a
minute
she
heard
the
voices
of
men
below
her
but
she
could
not
open
her
eyes
to
look
tommy
supported
her
strongly
and
in
a
few
seconds
she
was
aware
of
someone
on
her
other
side
of
a
steady
capable
hand
grasping
her
wrist
drink
this
said
ralston
voice
it
help
you
he
was
holding
something
to
her
lips
and
she
drank
mechanically
that
better
he
said
you
had
a
rough
time
i
afraid
but
over
now
think
you
can
walk
or
shall
we
carry
you
the
tones
seemed
to
calm
the
chaos
of
her
brain
she
looked
up
at
him
with
a
faint
brave
smile
i
will
walk
of
course
there
is
nothing
the
matter
with
me
what
has
happened
at
kurrumpore
is
all
well
he
met
her
eyes
yes
he
said
quietly
her
look
flinched
momentarily
from
his
but
the
next
instant
she
met
it
squarely
i
know
about
my
baby
she
said
he
bent
his
head
you
could
not
wish
it
otherwise
he
said
gently
she
answered
him
with
firmness
no
the
few
words
helped
to
restore
her
with
her
hand
upon
tommy
arm
she
descended
the
steps
into
the
green
gloom
of
the
jungle
the
morning
sun
was
smiting
through
the
leaves
it
gleamed
in
her
eyes
like
the
flashing
of
a
sword
but
though
the
simile
held
her
mind
for
a
space
she
felt
no
shrinking
she
had
a
curious
conviction
that
the
path
lay
open
before
her
at
last
the
angel
with
the
flaming
sword
no
longer
barred
the
way
a
party
of
indian
soldiers
awaited
her
she
did
not
see
how
many
perhaps
she
was
too
tired
to
take
any
very
vivid
interest
in
her
surroundings
a
native
litter
stood
a
few
yards
from
the
foot
of
the
steps
tommy
guided
her
to
it
major
ralston
walking
on
her
other
side
she
turned
to
the
latter
as
they
reached
it
where
is
hanani
she
said
he
raised
his
brows
for
a
moment
she
has
probably
gone
back
to
her
people
he
answered
she
was
here
with
me
only
a
minute
ago
stella
said
he
glanced
round
she
knows
her
way
no
doubt
we
had
better
not
wait
now
if
you
want
her
i
will
find
her
for
you
later
thank
you
stella
said
but
she
still
paused
looking
from
ralston
to
tommy
and
back
again
as
one
uncertain
what
is
it
darling
said
tommy
gently
she
put
her
hand
to
her
head
with
a
weary
gesture
of
bewilderment
i
am
very
stupid
she
said
i
ca
think
properly
you
are
sure
everything
is
all
right
quite
sure
dear
he
said
do
try
to
think
now
you
are
done
up
you
must
rest
her
face
quivered
suddenly
like
the
face
of
a
tired
child
i
want
everard
she
said
piteously
wo
you
ca
you
bring
him
to
me
there
is
something
i
want
to
say
to
him
there
was
an
instant
pause
she
felt
tommy
arm
tighten
protectingly
around
her
but
he
did
not
speak
it
was
major
ralston
who
answered
her
certainly
he
shall
come
to
you
i
will
see
that
he
does
the
confidence
of
his
reply
comforted
her
she
trusted
major
ralston
instinctively
she
entered
the
litter
and
sank
down
among
the
cushions
with
a
sigh
as
they
bore
her
away
along
the
narrow
winding
path
which
once
she
had
trodden
with
everard
monck
so
long
long
ago
on
the
night
of
her
surrender
to
the
mastery
of
his
love
utter
exhaustion
overcame
her
and
the
sleep
which
for
so
long
she
had
denied
herself
came
upon
her
like
an
overwhelming
flood
sweeping
her
once
more
into
the
deeps
of
oblivion
she
went
without
a
backward
thought
chapter
x
the
angel
it
was
many
hours
before
she
awoke
and
in
all
those
hours
she
never
dreamed
she
only
slept
and
slept
and
slept
in
total
unconsciousness
wrapt
about
in
the
silence
of
her
desert
she
awoke
at
length
quite
fully
quite
suddenly
to
a
sense
of
appalling
loneliness
to
a
desolation
unutterable
she
opened
her
eyes
wide
upon
a
darkness
that
could
be
felt
and
almost
cried
aloud
with
the
terror
of
it
for
a
few
palpitating
moments
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
most
dreadful
thing
that
could
possibly
happen
to
her
had
come
upon
her
unawares
and
then
even
as
she
started
up
in
a
wild
horror
a
voice
spoke
to
her
a
hand
touched
her
and
her
fear
was
stayed
stella
the
voice
said
and
steady
fingers
came
up
out
of
the
darkness
and
closed
upon
her
arm
her
heart
gave
one
great
leap
within
her
and
was
still
she
did
not
speak
in
answer
for
she
could
not
she
could
only
sit
in
the
darkness
and
wait
if
it
were
a
dream
it
would
pass
ah
so
swiftly
if
it
were
reality
surely
surely
he
would
speak
again
he
spoke
softly
through
the
silence
i
do
want
to
startle
you
are
you
startled
i
put
out
the
lamp
you
are
not
afraid
her
voice
came
back
to
her
her
heart
jerked
on
beating
strangely
spasmodically
like
a
maimed
thing
am
i
awake
she
said
is
it
really
you
yes
he
said
can
you
listen
to
me
a
moment
you
wo
be
afraid
she
quivered
at
the
repeated
question
everard
no
he
was
silent
then
as
if
he
did
not
know
how
to
continue
and
she
finding
her
strength
leaned
to
him
in
the
darkness
feeling
for
him
still
hardly
believing
that
it
was
not
a
dream
he
took
her
wandering
hand
and
held
it
imprisoned
the
firmness
of
his
grasp
reassured
her
but
it
came
to
her
that
his
hands
were
cold
and
she
wondered
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
he
said
she
sat
quite
still
in
his
hold
but
it
frightened
her
where
are
you
she
whispered
i
am
just
kneeling
by
your
side
he
said
do
tremble
or
be
afraid
there
is
nothing
to
frighten
you
stella
his
voice
came
almost
in
a
whisper
hanani
the
told
you
something
in
the
ruined
temple
at
khanmulla
can
you
remember
what
it
was
ah
she
said
do
you
mean
about
ralph
dacre
i
do
mean
that
he
said
i
do
know
if
you
actually
believed
it
it
may
have
sounded
fantastic
but
it
was
true
ah
she
said
again
and
then
she
knew
why
he
had
turned
out
the
lamp
it
was
that
he
might
not
see
her
face
when
he
told
her
or
she
his
he
went
on
his
hold
upon
her
had
tightened
but
she
knew
that
he
was
unconscious
of
it
it
was
as
if
he
clung
to
her
in
anguish
though
she
heard
no
sign
of
suffering
in
his
low
voice
i
have
done
the
utmost
to
keep
the
truth
from
you
but
fate
has
been
against
me
all
through
i
sent
him
away
from
you
in
the
first
place
because
i
heard
too
late
that
he
had
a
wife
in
england
i
married
you
because
he
paused
momentarily
ah
well
that
does
come
into
the
story
he
said
i
married
you
believing
you
free
then
came
bernard
and
told
me
that
the
wife
dacre
wife
had
died
just
before
his
marriage
to
you
that
also
came
too
late
he
stopped
again
and
she
knew
that
his
head
was
bowed
upon
his
arms
though
she
could
not
free
her
hand
to
touch
it
you
know
the
rest
he
said
and
his
voice
came
to
her
oddly
broken
and
unfamiliar
i
kept
it
from
you
i
could
bear
the
thought
of
your
facing
that
especially
after
after
the
birth
of
the
child
even
when
you
found
out
i
had
tricked
you
in
that
native
i
endure
the
thought
of
your
knowing
i
nearly
killed
myself
that
night
it
seemed
the
only
way
but
bernard
stopped
me
i
told
him
the
truth
he
said
i
was
wrong
not
to
tell
you
but
somehow
i
could
oh
i
wish
i
wish
you
had
she
breathed
do
you
well
i
could
it
hard
enough
to
tell
you
now
you
were
so
wonderful
so
beautiful
and
they
had
flung
mud
at
you
from
the
beginning
i
thought
i
had
made
you
safe
dear
instead
of
dragging
you
down
everard
her
voice
was
quick
and
passionate
she
made
a
sudden
effort
and
freed
one
hand
but
he
caught
it
again
sharply
no
you
must
stella
i
have
finished
wait
his
voice
compelled
her
she
submitted
hardly
knowing
that
she
did
so
it
is
over
now
he
said
the
fellow
is
dead
but
stella
he
had
found
out
what
i
had
found
out
and
he
was
on
his
way
to
you
he
meant
to
claim
you
she
shuddered
a
hard
convulsive
shudder
as
if
some
loathsome
thing
had
touched
her
but
i
would
never
have
gone
back
she
said
no
he
answered
grimly
you
would
i
was
here
and
i
should
have
shot
him
they
saved
me
that
trouble
you
were
here
she
said
yes
much
nearer
to
you
than
you
imagined
almost
curtly
he
answered
did
you
think
i
would
leave
you
at
the
mercy
of
those
devils
you
he
stopped
himself
sharply
no
i
was
here
to
protect
you
and
i
would
have
done
it
though
i
should
have
shot
myself
afterwards
even
bernard
would
have
seen
the
force
of
that
but
it
did
come
to
pass
that
way
it
was
intended
that
it
should
well
it
is
over
there
are
not
many
who
know
only
bernard
tommy
and
ralston
they
are
going
if
possible
to
keep
it
dark
to
suppress
his
name
i
told
them
they
must
his
voice
rang
suddenly
harsh
but
softened
again
immediately
all
dear
or
nearly
all
i
hope
it
has
shocked
you
unutterably
i
think
the
secret
is
safe
anyhow
so
you
wo
have
that
to
face
going
now
i
send
peter
to
light
the
lamp
and
bring
you
something
to
eat
and
you
undress
wo
you
and
go
to
bed
it
late
he
made
as
if
he
would
rise
but
her
hands
turned
swiftly
in
his
turned
and
held
him
fast
everard
everard
why
should
you
go
she
whispered
tensely
into
the
darkness
that
hid
his
face
he
yielded
in
a
measure
to
her
hold
but
he
would
not
suffer
himself
to
be
drawn
nearer
why
she
said
again
insistently
he
hesitated
i
think
he
said
slowly
that
you
will
find
an
answer
to
that
question
possibly
more
than
one
when
you
have
had
time
to
think
it
over
what
do
you
mean
she
breathed
must
i
put
it
into
words
he
said
she
heard
the
pain
in
his
voice
but
for
the
first
time
she
passed
it
by
unheeded
yes
tell
me
she
said
i
must
know
he
was
silent
for
a
little
as
if
mustering
his
forces
then
his
hands
tight
upon
hers
he
spoke
in
the
first
place
you
are
dacre
widow
and
not
my
wife
she
quivered
in
his
hold
and
then
she
whispered
and
then
he
said
our
baby
is
dead
so
you
are
free
from
all
obligations
her
hands
clenched
hard
upon
his
is
that
all
no
with
sudden
passion
he
answered
her
there
are
two
more
reasons
why
i
should
go
one
is
that
i
have
made
your
life
a
hell
on
earth
you
have
said
it
and
i
know
it
to
be
true
ah
you
had
better
let
me
go
and
go
quickly
for
your
own
sake
you
had
better
but
she
ignored
the
warning
holding
him
almost
fiercely
and
the
last
reason
she
said
he
was
silent
for
a
few
seconds
and
in
his
silence
there
was
something
of
an
electric
quality
something
that
pierced
and
scorched
yet
strangely
drew
her
someone
else
can
tell
you
that
he
said
at
length
it
is
that
i
am
a
broken
man
i
know
that
would
affect
you
one
way
or
another
it
is
that
i
have
done
a
thing
that
you
would
hate
yet
that
i
would
do
again
if
the
need
arose
you
can
ask
ralston
what
it
is
say
i
told
you
to
he
knows
but
i
ask
you
she
said
and
still
her
hands
gripped
his
everard
why
do
you
tell
me
are
you
afraid
to
tell
me
no
he
said
then
answer
me
she
said
her
breathing
sharp
and
uneven
tell
me
the
truth
make
me
understand
you
once
and
for
all
you
have
always
understood
me
he
said
no
no
she
protested
well
nearly
always
he
amended
as
long
as
you
have
known
my
love
you
have
known
me
my
love
for
you
is
myself
the
immortal
part
the
rest
does
count
ah
she
said
and
suddenly
the
very
soul
of
her
rose
up
and
spoke
then
you
need
tell
me
any
more
dear
love
dear
love
i
do
need
to
hear
it
it
does
matter
it
ca
make
any
difference
nothing
ever
can
again
for
as
you
say
nothing
else
counts
go
if
you
must
but
if
you
do
i
shall
follow
you
i
shall
follow
you
to
the
world
end
stella
he
said
i
mean
it
she
told
him
and
her
voice
throbbed
with
a
fiery
force
that
was
deeper
than
passion
stronger
than
aught
human
you
are
mine
and
i
am
yours
god
knows
dear
god
knows
that
is
all
that
matters
now
i
did
understand
before
i
do
now
i
think
suffering
has
taught
me
many
things
perhaps
it
is
his
angel
the
angel
with
the
flaming
sword
he
said
under
his
breath
but
the
sword
is
turned
away
she
said
the
way
is
open
he
got
to
his
feet
abruptly
wait
he
said
before
you
say
that
wait
he
freed
himself
from
her
hold
gently
but
very
decidedly
she
knew
that
for
a
second
he
stood
close
above
her
with
arms
outflung
before
he
turned
away
then
there
came
the
rasp
of
a
match
a
sudden
flare
in
the
darkness
she
looked
to
see
his
face
and
uttered
a
cry
it
was
hanani
the
veiled
who
stooped
to
kindle
the
lamp
chapter
xi
the
dawn
this
country
is
like
an
infernal
machine
said
bernard
you
never
know
when
it
going
to
explode
there
only
one
reliable
thing
in
it
and
that
peter
he
turned
his
bandaged
head
in
the
latter
direction
and
received
a
tender
indulgent
smile
in
answer
peter
loved
the
big
with
the
same
love
which
he
had
for
the
children
of
the
whatever
happens
bernard
continued
there
always
peter
he
keeps
the
whole
show
going
and
is
never
absent
when
wanted
in
fact
i
begin
to
think
that
india
would
be
india
without
him
a
very
handsome
compliment
said
sir
reginald
it
is
is
it
smiled
bernard
i
have
a
vast
respect
for
him
a
quite
unbounded
respect
he
is
the
greatest
greaser
of
wheels
i
have
ever
met
help
yourself
sir
wo
you
i
am
sorry
i
ca
join
you
but
major
ralston
insists
that
i
must
walk
circumspectly
being
on
his
sick
list
i
really
do
know
why
my
skull
was
not
cracked
he
declares
it
ought
to
have
been
and
even
seems
inclined
to
be
rather
disgusted
with
me
because
it
was
you
had
a
very
lucky
escape
said
sir
reginald
allow
me
to
congratulate
you
and
a
very
enjoyable
scrap
said
bernard
with
kindling
eyes
thanks
i
would
have
missed
it
for
the
world
the
damn
dirty
blackguards
was
monck
much
upset
asked
sir
reginald
i
have
never
yet
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
her
she
was
more
upset
on
my
brother
account
than
her
own
bernard
said
giving
his
visitor
a
shrewd
look
she
thought
he
had
come
to
harm
ah
said
sir
reginald
and
held
his
glass
up
to
the
light
and
that
was
not
so
no
said
bernard
and
closed
his
lips
there
was
a
distinct
pause
before
sir
reginald
eyes
left
his
glass
and
came
down
to
him
they
held
a
faint
whimsical
smile
we
owe
your
brother
a
good
deal
he
said
do
we
said
bernard
sir
reginald
smile
became
more
pronounced
i
have
been
told
that
it
is
entirely
owing
to
him
his
forethought
secrecy
and
intimate
knowledge
obtained
at
considerable
personal
risk
that
this
business
was
not
of
a
far
more
serious
nature
i
was
of
course
in
constant
communication
with
colonel
mansfield
we
knew
exactly
where
the
danger
lay
and
we
were
prepared
for
all
emergencies
except
the
one
which
actually
rose
suggested
bernard
that
said
sir
reginald
that
was
a
mere
flash
in
the
pan
but
we
were
prepared
even
for
that
my
men
were
all
in
markestan
by
daybreak
thanks
to
the
promptitude
of
young
denvers
if
all
our
throats
had
been
slit
the
previous
night
that
would
have
helped
us
much
bernard
pointed
out
sir
reginald
broke
into
a
laugh
well
dash
it
man
we
did
our
best
and
anyway
they
were
so
you
have
much
cause
for
complaint
you
see
i
was
one
of
the
casualties
explained
bernard
that
accounts
for
my
being
a
bit
critical
so
you
expected
something
worse
than
this
i
did
sir
reginald
spoke
soberly
again
if
we
had
been
prepared
the
whole
of
markestan
would
have
been
ablaze
by
now
from
end
to
end
instead
of
which
you
have
only
permitted
us
a
fizz
a
few
bangs
and
a
as
tommy
describes
it
remarked
bernard
and
you
even
caught
the
rajah
i
was
out
to
catch
him
said
sir
reginald
but
i
will
tell
you
who
i
am
out
to
catch
though
i
am
afraid
i
am
applying
in
the
wrong
quarter
bernard
eyes
gleamed
with
a
hint
of
malicious
amusement
i
thought
my
health
was
not
primarily
responsible
for
the
honour
of
your
visit
sir
he
said
no
said
sir
reginald
with
simplicity
i
really
came
because
i
want
to
take
you
into
my
confidence
and
to
ask
for
your
confidence
in
return
i
thought
so
said
bernard
and
slowly
shook
his
head
i
afraid
it
no
go
i
am
sealed
ah
and
that
even
though
i
give
you
my
word
it
would
be
to
your
brother
interest
to
break
the
seal
questioned
sir
reginald
bernard
eyes
suddenly
drooped
under
their
red
brows
and
betray
my
trust
he
said
lazily
i
beg
your
pardon
said
sir
reginald
he
finished
his
drink
with
a
speed
that
suggested
embarrassment
but
the
next
moment
he
smiled
you
had
me
there
padre
i
withdraw
the
suggestion
i
should
not
have
made
it
if
i
could
see
the
man
himself
but
he
has
disappeared
and
even
barnes
who
knows
everything
tell
us
where
to
look
for
him
neither
can
i
said
bernard
i
am
not
in
his
confidence
to
that
extent
why
do
you
ask
his
wife
a
low
voice
said
both
men
started
sir
reginald
sprang
to
his
feet
mrs
monck
yes
stella
said
she
stood
a
moment
framed
in
the
french
window
looking
at
him
then
she
stepped
forward
with
outstretched
hand
the
morning
sunshine
caught
her
as
she
moved
she
was
very
pale
and
her
eyes
were
deeply
shadowed
but
she
was
exceedingly
beautiful
i
heard
your
voices
she
said
looking
at
sir
reginald
while
her
hand
lay
in
his
i
did
mean
to
listen
at
first
but
i
was
tempted
because
you
were
talking
of
my
husband
and
she
smiled
at
him
faintly
i
fell
i
think
you
were
justified
sir
reginald
said
thank
you
she
answered
gently
she
turned
from
him
to
bernard
and
bending
kissed
him
are
you
better
peter
told
me
it
was
serious
i
would
have
come
to
you
sooner
but
i
was
asleep
for
a
very
long
time
and
afterwards
everard
wanted
me
everard
he
said
sharply
is
he
here
sit
down
murmured
sir
reginald
drawing
forward
his
chair
but
stella
remained
standing
her
hand
upon
bernard
shoulder
thank
you
but
i
have
come
to
stay
only
to
tell
you
just
to
tell
you
all
the
things
that
bernard
could
without
betraying
his
trust
my
dear
dear
child
bernard
broke
in
quickly
but
sir
reginald
intervened
in
the
same
moment
no
no
pardon
me
let
her
speak
she
wishes
to
do
so
and
i
wish
to
listen
stella
hand
pressed
a
little
upon
bernard
shoulder
as
though
she
supported
herself
thereby
it
is
right
that
you
should
know
sir
reginald
she
said
it
is
only
for
my
sake
that
it
has
been
kept
from
you
but
i
have
travelled
the
desert
too
long
to
mind
an
extra
stone
or
two
by
the
way
first
with
regard
to
the
suspicion
which
drove
him
out
of
the
army
you
thought
everyone
thought
that
he
had
killed
ralph
dacre
up
in
the
mountains
even
i
thought
so
her
voice
trembled
a
little
and
i
had
less
excuse
than
any
one
else
for
he
swore
to
me
that
he
was
innocent
though
he
would
not
could
not
tell
me
the
truth
of
the
matter
the
truth
was
simply
this
ralph
dacre
was
not
dead
ah
sir
reginald
said
softly
bernard
reached
up
and
strongly
grasped
the
hand
that
rested
upon
him
but
he
spoke
no
word
stella
went
on
with
greater
steadiness
her
eyes
resolutely
meeting
the
shrewd
old
eyes
that
watched
her
he
everard
came
between
us
because
only
a
fortnight
after
our
marriage
he
received
the
news
that
ralph
had
a
wife
living
in
england
perhaps
i
ought
to
tell
you
though
this
in
no
way
influenced
him
that
my
marriage
to
ralph
was
a
mistake
i
married
him
because
i
was
unhappy
not
because
i
loved
him
i
sinned
and
i
have
been
punished
poor
girl
said
sir
reginald
very
gently
her
eyelids
quivered
but
she
would
not
suffer
them
to
fall
everard
sent
him
away
from
me
made
him
vanish
completely
and
then
came
himself
to
me
he
was
in
native
disguise
and
told
me
he
was
dead
i
suppose
it
was
wrong
of
him
if
so
he
too
has
been
punished
but
he
wanted
to
save
my
pride
i
had
plenty
of
pride
in
those
days
it
is
all
gone
now
at
least
all
i
have
left
is
for
him
that
his
honour
may
be
vindicated
i
am
afraid
i
am
telling
the
story
very
badly
forgive
me
for
taking
so
long
there
is
no
hurry
sir
reginald
answered
in
the
same
gentle
voice
and
you
are
telling
it
very
well
she
smiled
again
her
faint
sad
smile
you
are
very
kind
it
makes
it
much
easier
you
know
how
clever
he
is
in
native
disguise
i
never
recognized
him
i
came
back
as
i
thought
a
widow
and
then
it
was
nearly
a
year
after
i
married
everard
because
i
loved
him
it
was
just
before
captain
ermsted
murder
we
had
to
come
back
here
in
a
hurry
because
of
it
then
when
the
summer
came
we
had
to
separate
i
went
to
bhulwana
for
the
birth
of
my
baby
and
while
i
was
there
he
heard
that
ralph
dacre
wife
had
died
in
england
only
a
few
days
before
his
marriage
to
me
that
meant
of
course
that
i
was
not
everard
legal
wife
that
the
baby
was
illegitimate
but
i
was
very
ill
at
the
time
he
kept
it
from
me
of
course
he
did
said
sir
reginald
of
course
he
did
said
bernard
yes
she
assented
he
could
help
himself
then
but
he
ought
to
have
told
me
afterwards
when
when
i
began
to
have
that
horrible
suspicion
that
everyone
else
had
that
he
had
murdered
ralph
dacre
a
difficult
point
said
sir
reginald
i
told
him
he
was
making
a
mistake
said
bernard
stella
glanced
down
at
him
it
was
a
mistake
she
said
but
he
made
it
out
of
love
for
me
because
he
thought
he
thought
that
my
pride
was
dearer
to
me
than
my
love
i
do
wonder
he
thought
so
i
gave
him
every
reason
for
i
would
listen
to
him
would
believe
him
i
sent
him
away
her
breath
caught
suddenly
and
she
put
a
quick
hand
to
her
throat
that
is
what
hurts
me
most
she
said
after
a
moment
just
to
remember
that
to
remember
what
i
made
him
suffer
how
i
failed
him
when
tommy
even
tommy
believed
in
him
went
after
him
to
tell
him
so
but
we
all
make
mistakes
said
sir
reginald
gently
or
we
be
human
she
controlled
herself
with
an
effort
yes
he
said
that
and
told
me
to
forget
it
i
do
know
if
i
can
but
i
shall
try
i
shall
try
to
make
up
to
him
for
it
for
as
long
as
i
live
and
i
thank
god
for
giving
me
the
chance
her
deep
voice
quivered
and
bernard
hand
tightened
upon
hers
yes
he
said
looking
at
sir
reginald
ralph
dacre
is
dead
he
was
the
unknown
man
who
was
shot
in
the
jungle
two
nights
ago
indeed
said
sir
reginald
sharply
yes
stella
said
he
too
had
found
out
about
the
death
of
his
first
wife
and
he
was
on
his
way
to
me
but
she
suddenly
covered
her
eyes
i
could
have
borne
it
i
would
have
killed
myself
first
bernard
reached
up
and
thrust
his
arm
about
her
without
speaking
she
leaned
against
him
for
a
few
seconds
as
if
the
story
had
taxed
her
strength
too
far
then
sir
reginald
came
to
her
and
with
a
fatherly
gesture
drew
her
hand
away
from
her
face
my
dear
he
said
very
kindly
thank
you
a
thousand
times
for
telling
me
this
i
know
it
been
infernally
hard
i
admire
you
for
it
more
than
i
can
say
it
has
been
too
much
for
you
i
hope
she
smiled
at
him
through
tears
no
no
you
are
both
so
kind
he
stooped
with
a
very
courtly
gesture
and
carried
her
hand
to
his
lips
everard
monck
is
a
very
lucky
man
he
said
but
i
think
he
is
almost
worthy
of
his
luck
and
now
i
want
you
to
tell
me
one
thing
more
where
can
i
find
him
her
hand
trembled
a
little
in
his
i
am
not
sure
he
would
wish
me
to
tell
you
that
sir
reginald
grey
moustache
twitched
whimsically
if
his
desire
for
privacy
is
so
great
it
shall
be
respected
will
you
take
him
a
message
from
me
of
course
she
said
sir
reginald
patted
her
hand
and
released
it
then
please
tell
him
he
said
that
the
indian
empire
can
not
afford
to
lose
the
services
of
so
valuable
a
servant
as
he
has
proved
himself
to
be
and
if
he
will
accept
a
secretaryship
with
me
i
think
there
is
small
doubt
that
it
will
eventually
lead
to
much
greater
things
stella
gave
a
great
start
oh
do
you
mean
that
she
said
sir
reginald
smiled
openly
i
really
do
monck
and
i
shall
think
myself
very
fortunate
to
secure
him
you
will
use
your
influence
i
hope
to
induce
him
to
accept
but
of
course
she
said
poor
stella
said
bernard
and
she
hates
india
she
turned
upon
him
almost
in
anger
how
dare
you
pity
me
i
love
anywhere
that
i
can
be
with
him
so
like
a
woman
commented
bernard
or
is
it
something
in
the
air
i
never
bring
tessa
out
here
when
she
grown
up
or
she
marry
and
be
stuck
here
for
the
rest
of
her
life
you
can
do
as
you
like
with
tessa
said
stella
and
turned
again
to
sir
reginald
is
that
all
you
want
of
me
now
one
thing
more
he
answered
gently
i
hope
i
may
say
it
without
giving
offence
with
a
gesture
regal
she
gave
him
both
her
hands
you
may
say
anything
she
said
impulsively
he
bent
again
courteously
monck
will
you
invite
me
to
witness
the
ratification
of
the
bond
already
existing
between
my
friend
everard
monck
and
the
lady
who
is
honouring
him
by
becoming
his
lawful
wife
she
flushed
deeply
but
not
painfully
i
will
she
said
bernard
you
will
see
to
that
i
know
yes

it
to
me

bernard

many

your
graciousness

a
stranger
oh

she
answered
quickly
you
are
a
friend
of
us
both
i
am
proud
to
be
called
so
he
said
as
she
passed
back
into
the
bungalow
her
heart
fluttered
within
her
like
the
wings
of
a
bird
mounting
upwards
in
the
dawning
the
sun
had
risen
upon
the
desert
chapter
xii
the
blue
jay
tommy
says
his
name
is
sprinter
but
uncle
bernard
calls
him
whisky
i
wonder
which
is
the
prettiest
said
tessa
i
should
call
him
whisky
out
of
compliment
to
uncle
bernard
said
ralston
he
certainly
does
whisk
said
tessa
but
then
tommy
gave
him
to
me
she
spoke
with
tender
eyes
upon
a
young
mongoose
that
gambolled
at
her
feet
is
he
a
love
she
said
but
he
is
nearly
so
pretty
as
darling
scooter
she
added
loyally

aunt
mary
not

dear
said
ralston
with
a
smile
i
wish

bernard

said
tessa
restlessly
i
hope
you
are
going
to
be
very
good

ralston
oh

tessa
rather
wearily
but
i
wish

so
soon

you
think
uncle
bernard
will
spoil
me
aunt
mary
i
hope

little
i
wonder

do
want

aunt
mary
i
should
think
about

ralston
sensibly
but
i
want
to
think
about
it
said
tessa
earnestly
i
want
to
think
about
every
minute
of
it
i
shall
enjoy
it
so
dear
uncle
bernard
said
in
his
letter
the
other
day
that
we
should
be
like
the
little
pigs
setting
out
to
seek
their
fortunes
he
says

to
send

ralston
we
will
hope
so
anyway
he

promised

tessa

wistfully

ralston

tessa
and
oh
here
they
are
at
last
take
care
of
whisky
for
me
while
i
go
and
meet
them
she
was
gone
with
the
words
a
little
flying
figure
with
arms
outspread
rushing
to
meet
her
friends
that
child
gets
wilder
and
more
every
day
observed
lady
harriet
who
was
passing
the
grand
stand
in
her
carriage
at
the
moment
she
will
certainly
go
the
same
way
as
her
mother
if
that
very
parson
has
the
managing
of
her
the
parson
however
had
no
such
misgivings
he
caught
the
child
up
in
his
arms
with
a
whoop
of
welcome
well
run
my
princess
bluebell
hullo
tommy
who
are
you
saluting
so
deferentially
only
that
vicious
old
white
cat
lady
harriet
said
tommy
hullo
tessa
your
legs
get
six
inches
longer
every
time
i
look
at
put
her
down
bernard
she
going
to
race
me
to
the
grand
stand
but
i
want
to
go
and
see
uncle
everard
and
aunt
stella
at
the
nest
protested
tessa
hanging
back
from
the
contest
besides
aunt
mary
says
i
not
to
get
hot
you
ca
go
there
anyway
said
tommy
inexorably
the
nest
is
closed
to
the
public
for
they
are
going
to
have
a
very
sacred
and
particular
evening
all
to
themselves
that
why
they
would
come
in
here
with
us
are
they
asked
tessa
with
serious
eyes
do
you
know
i
heard
a
blue
jay
laughing
up
there
this
morning
was
that
what
he
meant
something
of
that
silly
nature
said
tommy
and
he
going
to
be
a
public
character
is
uncle
everard
so
he
is
wise
to
make
the
most
of
his
privacy
now
ah
bhulwana
he
stretched
his
arms
to
the
how
i
have
yearned
for
thee
and
me
too
said
tessa
jealously
he
looked
at
her
you
you
scaramouch
of
course
not
whoever
yearned
for
a
thing
like
you
a
creature
without
any
front
teeth
worth
mentioning
i
have
you
horrid
cried
tessa
stamping
an
indignant
foot
he
horrid
uncle
bernard
if
it
were
for
that
darling
mongoose
i
should
hate
him
oh
but
it
wrong
to
hate
people
you
know
bernard
passed
a
pacifying
arm
about
her
quivering
form
you
just
treat
him
to
the
contempt
he
deserves
and
give
all
your
attention
to
your
doting
old
uncle
who
has
honestly
been
longing
for
you
from
the
moment
you
left
him
oh
darling
she
turned
to
him
swiftly
i
never
go
away
from
you
again
i
can
say
that
now
ca
i
her
red
lips
were
lifted
he
stooped
and
kissed
them
it
the
one
thing
i
love
to
hear
you
say
my
princess
he
said
the
sun
set
in
a
glory
of
red
and
purple
that
night
spreading
the
royal
colours
far
across
the
calm
sky
it
faded
very
quickly
the
night
swooped
down
swift
and
soundless
and
in
the
verandah
of
the
bungalow
known
as
the
nest
a
red
lamp
glowed
with
a
steady
beam
across
the
darkness
two
figures
stood
for
a
space
under
the
acacia
by
the
gate
lingering
in
the
evening
quiet
now
and
then
there
was
the
flutter
of
wings
above
them
and
the
white
flowers
fell
and
scattered
like
bridal
blossoms
all
around
we
must
go
in
said
stella
peter
will
be
disappointed
if
we
keep
the
dinner
waiting
ah
we
must
hurt
his
august
feelings
conceded
everard
we
owe
him
a
mighty
lot
my
stella
i
wish
we
could
make
some
return
his
greatest
reward
is
to
let
him
serve
us
she
answered
his
love
is
the
kind
that
needs
to
serve
which
is
the
highest
kind
of
love
said
everard
holding
her
to
him
do
you
know
hanani
discovered
that
for
me
she
pressed
close
to
his
side
everard
darling
why
did
you
keep
that
secret
so
long
my
dear
he
said
and
was
silent
well
wo
you
tell
me
she
urged
i
think
you
might
he
hesitated
a
moment
longer
then
do
let
it
hurt
you
dear
he
said
but
actually
i
was
sure
that
you
cared
until
i
was
with
you
in
the
temple
and
saw
you
weeping
for
me
oh
everard
she
said
he
folded
her
in
his
arms
my
darling
i
thought
i
had
killed
your
love
and
even
though
i
found
then
that
i
was
wrong
i
was
sure
that
you
would
ever
forgive
me
for
playing
that
last
trick
upon
you
ah
she
whispered
and
if
i
had
forgiven
you
i
should
have
gone
away
he
said
you
would
have
left
me
she
pressed
closer
i
should
have
come
back
to
you
sometimes
sweetheart
in
some
other
guise
i
could
have
kept
away
for
ever
but
i
would
never
have
intruded
upon
you
he
said
everard
everard
she
hid
her
face
against
him
you
make
me
feel
so
ashamed
so
utterly
unworthy
do
darling
do
he
whispered
let
us
be
happy
and
i
wanted
you
so
i
missed
you
so
she
said
brokenly
he
turned
her
face
up
to
his
own
i
missed
myself
a
bit
too
he
said
i
could
have
played
the
hanani
game
if
peter
had
put
me
up
to
it
darling
are
those
actually
tears
because
i
wo
have
them
you
are
going
to
look
forward
not
back
she
clung
to
him
closely
passionately
yes
yes
i
will
look
forward
but
oh
everard
promise
me
promise
me
you
will
never
deceive
me
again
i
do
believe
i
could
any
more
he
said
but
promise
she
urged
very
well
my
dear
one
i
promise
there
is
that
enough
he
kissed
her
quivering
face
holding
her
clasped
to
his
heart
i
will
never
trick
you
again
as
long
as
i
live
but
i
had
to
be
near
you
and
it
was
the
only
way
now
am
i
quite
forgiven
of
course
you
are
she
told
him
tremulously
it
was
a
matter
for
forgiveness
besides
anyhow
you
were
justified
and
everard
her
breathing
quickened
a
little
she
just
caught
back
a
sob
i
love
to
think
now
that
your
arms
held
our
baby
when
he
died
my
darling
my
own
girl
he
said
and
stopped
abruptly
for
his
voice
was
trembling
too
the
next
moment
very
tenderly
he
kissed
her
again
please
god
he
wo
be
the
only
one
he
said
softly
amen
she
whispered
back
in
the
acacia
boughs
above
them
the
blue
jay
suddenly
uttered
a
rippling
laugh
of
sheer
joy
and
flew
away
the
end

by

there
were
two
of
them
as
unlike
as
two
men
could
be
sir
eustace
big
domineering
haughty
used
to
sweeping
all
before
him
with
the
power
of
his
personality
the
other
was
stumpy
small
insignificant
quiet
with
a
little
limp
they
clashed
over
the
greatest
question
that
may
come
to
men
the
love
of
a
girl
she
took
sir
eustace
just
because
she
could
not
help
herself
and
was
swept
ahead
on
the
tide
of
his
passion
and
then
when
she
needed
help
most
on
the
day
before
the
wedding
stumpy
saved
her
and
the
quiet
flame
of
his
eyes
was
more
than
the
brute
power
of
his
brother
how
did
it
all
come
out
did
she
choose
wisely
is
greatheart
more
to
be
desired
