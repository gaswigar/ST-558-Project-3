by

i
i
really
fallen
chapter
i
off
to
blunderland
it
was
one
of
those
dull
drab
depressing
days
when
somehow
or
other
it
seemed
as
if
there
was
anything
anywhere
for
anybody
to
do
it
was
raining
outdoors
so
that
alice
could
not
amuse
herself
in
the
garden
or
call
upon
her
friend
little
lord
fauntleroy
up
the
street
and
downstairs
her
mother
was
giving
a
bridge
party
for
the
benefit
of
the
o
hot
tamale
company
which
had
lately
fallen
upon
evil
days
alice
mother
was
a
very
charitably
disposed
person
and
while
she
loathed
gambling
in
all
its
forms
was
nevertheless
willing
for
the
sake
of
a
good
cause
to
forego
her
principles
on
alternate
thursdays
but
she
was
very
particular
that
her
little
daughter
should
be
kept
aloof
from
contaminating
influences
so
that
alice
found
herself
locked
in
the
nursery
and
as
i
have
already
intimated
with
nothing
to
do
she
had
read
all
her
books
the
house
of
mirth
the
novels
of
hall
caine
and
marie
corelli
the
operation
for
appendicitis
upon
her
dollie
while
very
successful
indeed
had
left
poor
flaxilocks
without
a
scrap
of
sawdust
in
her
veins
and
therefore
unable
to
play
and
worst
of
all
her
pet
kitten
under
the
new
city
law
making
all
felines
public
property
had
grown
into
a
regular
cat
and
appeared
only
at
mealtimes
and
then
in
so
disreputable
a
condition
that
he
was
not
thought
to
be
fit
company
for
a
child
of
seven
oh
dear
cried
alice
impatiently
as
she
sat
rocking
in
her
chair
listening
to
the
pattering
of
the
rain
upon
the
roof
of
the
veranda
i
do
wish
there
was
something
to
do
or
somebody
to
do
or
somewhere
to
go
the
ought
to
provide
covered
playgrounds
for
children
on
wet
days
it
would
cost
much
to
put
a
glass
cover
on
the
park
a
very
good
idea
i
make
a
note
of
that
said
a
squeaky
little
voice
at
her
side
illustration
the
cheshire
cat
alice
sprang
to
her
feet
in
surprise
she
had
supposed
she
was
alone
and
for
a
moment
she
was
frightened
but
a
glance
around
reassured
her
for
strange
to
say
seated
on
the
radiator
warming
his
toes
was
her
old
friend
the
hatter
the
queer
old
chap
she
had
met
in
her
marvellous
trip
through
wonderland
and
with
him
was
the
march
hare
the
cheshire
cat
and
the
white
knight
from
looking
glass
land
why
you
dear
old
things
she
cried
you
here
i
do
know
about
these
others
but
i
here
returned
the
hatter
the
others
seem
to
be
here
but
i
respectfully
decline
to
take
my
solemn
daffydavy
on
the
subject
because
my
doctor
says
i
all
the
time
seeing
things
that
ai
besides
i
do
believe
in
swearing
illustration
the
march
hare
we
here
all
right
put
in
the
march
hare
i
know
because
we
anywhere
else
and
when
you
ai
anywhere
else
you
can
make
up
your
mind
that
you
here
well
i
awfully
glad
to
see
you
said
alice
i
been
so
lonesome
we
know
that
said
the
white
knight
we
been
studying
your
case
lately
and
we
thought
we
come
down
and
see
what
we
could
do
for
you
the
fact
is
the
hatter
here
has
founded
a
model
city
where
everything
goes
just
right
and
we
came
to
ask
you
to
pay
us
a
call
a
city
cried
alice
yep
said
the
march
hare
it
called
blunderland
and
between
you
and
me
i
do
believe
anybody
but
the
hatter
could
have
invented
one
like
it
his
geegantic
brain
conceived
the
whole
thing
and
i
tell
you
it
a
corker
where
is
it
asked
alice
that
telling
said
the
hatter
i
have
had
it
copyrighted
yet
and
until
i
do
i
ai
going
to
tell
where
it
is
you
ca
be
too
careful
about
property
these
days
with
copperations
lurkin
around
everywhere
to
grab
everything
in
sight
what
a
copperation
asked
alice
what
never
heard
of
a
copperation
demanded
the
hatter
mercy
ever
hear
of
the
mumps
or
the
measles
or
the
whooping
cough
yes
but
i
never
knew
they
were
called
copperations
said
alice
illustration
listen
here
well
they
ai
but
they
no
worse
so
they
ought
to
be
said
the
hatter
listen
here
i
tell
you
what
a
copperation
is
and
putting
his
hat
in
front
of
his
mouth
like
a
telephone
the
hatter
recited
the
following
poem
through
it
the
copperation
a
copperation
is
a
beast
with
forty
leven
paws
that
does
ever
pay
the
least
attention
to
the
laws
it
grabs
whatever
comes
in
sight
from
hansom
cabs
to
socks
and
with
a
grin
of
mad
delight
it
turns
into
stocks
and
then
it
takes
a
rubber
hose
connected
with
the
sea
and
pumps
em
full
of
of
various
degree
and
when
they
swollen
up
so
stout
you
think
they
surely
bust
they
souse
once
again
and
out
they
come
at
last
a
trust
and
when
the
trust
is
ready
for
one
last
and
final
whack
they
let
the
public
in
the
door
to
buy
the
water
back
see
said
the
hatter
as
he
finished
no
said
alice
it
sounded
very
pretty
through
your
hat
but
i
understand
it
why
should
people
buy
water
when
they
can
get
it
for
nothing
in
the
ocean
you
like
all
the
rest
groaned
the
hatter
nobody
seems
to
understand
but
me
and
somehow
or
other
i
ca
make
it
clear
to
other
people
you
might
if
you
did
talk
through
your
hat
grinned
the
cheshire
cat
then
i
have
to
stop
being
a
public
character
said
the
hatter
not
going
to
sacrifice
my
career
just
because
you
too
ignorant
to
see
what
i
driving
at
i
do
mind
telling
you
though
alice
that
outside
of
poetry
a
copperation
is
a
creature
devised
by
selfish
interests
to
secure
the
free
coinage
of
the
atlantic
ocean
little
drops
of
water
plenty
of
hot
air
make
a
copperation
a
pretty
fat
affair
warbled
the
march
hare
o
well
said
alice
what
about
it
suppose
there
is
such
an
animal
around
what
are
we
going
to
do
about
it
we
going
to
gerraple
with
it
said
the
hatter
with
a
valiant
shake
of
his
hat
we
going
to
grab
it
by
its
throat
and
shake
it
down
and
shackle
it
so
that
in
forty
years
it
will
become
as
tame
as
a
fly
or
any
other
highly
domesticated
animal
but
how
asked
alice
you
are
going
to
do
this
yourself
are
you
single
handed
and
alone
illustration
the
municipal
chewery
yes
said
the
hatter
the
march
hare
and
the
white
knight
and
i
we
started
a
city
to
do
it
with
we
sprinkled
our
streets
with
rough
on
copperations
until
there
is
one
left
in
the
place
everything
in
town
belongs
to
the
people
street
cars

pavements
theatres
electric
light
cabs
manicures
dogs
cats
canary
birds
hotels
barber
shops
candy
stores
hats
umbrellas
bakeries
cakeries
steakeries
shops
you
ca
think
of
a
thing
that
the
city
do
own
no
more
private
ownership
of
anything
from
a
toothbrush
to
a
yacht
and
the
result
is
we
are
all
happy
it
sounds
fine
said
alice
though
i
think
i
should
rather
own
my
own
toothbrush
you
naturally
would
under
the
old
system
assented
the
hatter
under
a
system
of
private
ownership
owning
your
own
teeth
you
prefer
to
own
your
own
toothbrush
but
our
council
has
just
passed
a
law
making
teeth
public
property
you
see
we
found
that
some
people
had
teeth
and
other
people
had
which
is
hardly
a
fair
condition
under
a
republican
form
of
government
it
gave
one
class
of
citizens
a
distinct
advantage
over
other
people
and
the
declaration
of
independence
demands
absolute
equality
for
all
one
man
owning
his
own
teeth
could
eat
all
the
hickory
nuts
he
wanted
just
because
he
had
teeth
to
crack
with
while
another
man
not
having
teeth
had
either
to
swallow
em
whole
which
ruined
his
digestion
or
go
without
which
was
fair
i
see
said
alice
illustration
the
municipal
toothery
so
it
occurred
to
alderman
march
hare
here
continued
the
hatter
that
we
should
legislate
in
the
matter
and
at
our
last
session
we
passed
a
law
providing
for
the
municipal
ownership
of
teeth
so
that
now
when
a
toothless
wanderer
wants
a
hickory
nut
cracked
he
has
a
perfectly
legal
right
to
stop
anybody
in
the
street
who
has
teeth
and
make
him
crack
the
nut
for
him
of
course
we
had
a
little
trouble
enforcing
the
law
alleged
private
rights
are
always
difficult
to
get
around
possession
has
seemed
so
to
convince
people
that
they
have
inherent
rights
to
the
things
they
have
enjoyed
that
they
put
up
a
fight
and
appeal
to
the
constitution
and
all
that
and
even
when
you
mention
the
fact
as
i
did
in
a
case
that
came
up
the
other
day
when
a
man
refused
to
bite
on
another
chap
cigar
for
him
that
the
constitution
does
mention
teeth
anywhere
in
all
its
classes
they
are
not
easy
to
convince
this
fellow
insisted
that
his
teeth
were
private
property
and
no
city
law
should
make
them
public
property
he
going
to
take
it
to
the
supreme
court
meanwhile
his
teeth
are
in
the
custody
of
the
sheriff
and
what
has
become
of
the
man
asked
alice
he
in
the
custody
of
the
sheriff
too
said
the
hatter
we
arrange
it
any
other
way
except
by
pulling
his
teeth
and
he
did
want
that
i
ca
blame
him
said
alice
reflectively
i
should
hate
to
have
my
teeth
taken
away
from
me
o
there
no
obfuscation
about
it
said
the
hatter
confuscation
corrected
the
march
hare
i
wish
you
would
get
that
word
right
it
too
important
to
fool
with
thank
you
replied
the
hatter
my
mind
is
on
higher
things
than
mere
words
however
as
i
was
saying
there
is
no
cobfuscation
about
it
we
do
take
a
man
teeth
away
from
him
without
compensation
we
pay
him
what
the
teeth
are
worth
and
place
them
at
the
service
of
the
whole
community
where
do
you
get
the
money
to
pay
him
asked
alice
we
give
him
a
municipal
bond
explained
the
hatter
it
a
ten
per
cent
bond
costing
two
cents
to
print
when
he
cracks
a
hickory
nut
for
the
public
the
man
he
cracks
it
for
pays
him
a
cent
he
rings
this
up
on
a
cash
register
he
carries
pinned
to
his
vest
and
at
the
end
of
every
week
turns
in
the
cash
to
the
city
treasury
that
money
is
used
to
pay
the
interest
on
the
bonds
the
scheme
has
the
additional
advantage
that
it
makes
a
man
teeth
negotiable
property
in
the
sense
that
whereas
under
the
old
system
he
could
very
well
sell
his
teeth
under
the
new
system
he
can
sell
the
bond
if
he
gets
hard
up
moreover
the
city
government
having
acquired
control
has
to
pay
all
his
bills
supply
tooth
powder
and
so
on
which
results
in
a
great
saving
to
the
individual
it
hardly
costs
the
city
anything
except
for
the
tooth
inspector
who
is
paid
a
year
but
we
can
handle
that
easily
enough
provided
the
people
will
use
the
public
teeth
in
sufficiently
large
numbers
to
bring
in
dividends
anyhow
we
have
gone
in
for
it
and
i
see
no
reason
why
it
should
not
work
as
well
as
any
other
municipal
ownership
scheme
i
should
love
to
go
and
see
your
city
said
alice
who
though
not
quite
convinced
as
to
the
desirability
of
the
municipal
ownership
of
teeth
was
nevertheless
very
much
interested
very
well
said
the
hatter
we
can
go
at
once
for
i
see
the
train
is
already
standing
in
the
station
the
station
cried
alice
what
station
illustration
handing
her
a
card
but
before
the
hatter
could
answer
alice
glancing
through
the
window
caught
sight
of
a
very
beautiful
train
standing
before
the
veranda
and
in
a
moment
she
found
herself
stepping
on
board
with
her
friends
while
a
guard
at
the
door
was
handing
her
an
engraved
card
upon
a
silver
salver
respectfully
inviting
miss
alice
to
step
lively
there
chapter
ii
the
immovable
trolley
what
an
extraordinary
car
said
alice
as
she
stepped
into
the
brilliantly
lighted
vehicle
it
does
seem
to
have
any
end
to
it
she
added
as
she
passed
down
the
aisle
looking
for
the
front
platform
it
has
said
the
hatter
it
just
runs
on
forever
does
it
stop
anywhere
cried
alice
in
amazement
it
stops
everywhere
said
the
hatter
what
i
mean
is
it
has
any
ends
at
all
it
just
one
big
circular
car
that
runs
all
around
the
city
and
joins
itself
where
it
began
in
the
beginning
we
call
it
the
o
express
standing
for
municipal
ownership
and
money
owed
laughed
a
weasel
that
sat
on
the
other
side
of
the
car
illustration
put
that
fellow
off
put
that
fellow
off
said
the
march
hare
indignantly
conductor
out
with
him
the
conductor
immediately
threw
the
weasel
out
of
the
window
as
ordered
and
the
hatter
resumed
we
call
it
the
express
because
it
is
so
fast
he
continued
you
hardly
think
it
was
going
at
all
observed
alice
as
she
noticed
the
entire
lack
of
motion
in
the
car
it
is
said
the
hatter
it
built
on
a
solid
foundation
and
does
move
an
inch
and
yet
at
the
same
time
it
runs
all
around
the
city
it
was
my
idea
he
added
proudly
but
you
said
it
was
fast
protested
alice
and
so
it
is
my
child
said
the
hatter
kindly
it
as
fast
as
though
it
was
glued
down
with
mucilage
there
several
ways
of
being
fast
you
know
did
you
ever
hear
of
the
ballade
of
the
d
no
said
alice
it
a
sea
song
in
b
flat
said
the
hatter
i
will
sing
it
for
you
and
placing
his
hat
before
his
lips
to
give
a
greater
mellowness
to
his
voice
the
hatter
sang
the
ballade
of
the
o
the
good
ship
from
up
in
boston
went
sailing
the
bounding
blue
cargoed
with
apple
sass
she
sailed
around
ogunkit
bay
down
past
the
banks
of
quogue
and
on
a
brilliant
summer
day
just
off
the
coast
of
mandelay
she
landed
in
a
fog
so
brace
the
topsails
close
my
lads
and
stow
your
grog
my
crew
for
the
waves
are
steep
and
the
fog
is
deep
round
the
as
in
the
fog
she
groped
around
the
night
was
black
as
soot
she
ran
against
long
island
sound
out
where
the
codfish
toot
and
when
the
moon
rose
the
scene
so
smiling
sweet
and
bland
she
poked
her
nose
so
sharp
and
keen
was
freshly
painted
olive
green
deep
in
a
bar
of
sand
so
splice
the
garboard
strakes
my
lads
and
reef
the
starboard
screw
for
it
sticks
like
tar
that
sandy
bar
to
the
o
the
skipper
swore
with
a
and
the
crew
replied
and
then
with
a
cheerful
they
pumped
the
bowsprit
dry
three
cheers
the
mate
cried
with
a
sneeze
hurrah
for
this
old
boat
she
sails
two
knots
before
the
breeze
but
on
the
bar
by
jingo
the
fastest
thing
afloat
so
up
with
the
gallant
flag
my
lads
with
a
for
the
liner
fast
is
now
outclassed
by
the
alice
scratched
her
chin
in
perplexity
but
the
hatter
never
stopped
i
got
an
idea
from
that
ballad
he
rattled
on
if
you
want
trains
fast
you
got
to
build
fast
yes
but
if
they
do
go
how
does
anybody
get
anywhere
asked
alice
they
can
get
off
and
walk
said
the
hatter
and
it
a
great
deal
less
dangerous
getting
off
a
train
that
does
move
than
off
one
that
does
i
can
see
that
said
alice
that
weasel
for
instance
would
have
been
badly
hurt
if
he
had
been
thrown
through
the
window
of
a
moving
car
that
it
exactly
said
the
hatter
as
alderman
march
hare
puts
it
we
people
are
after
the
comfort
and
safety
of
the
people
first
last
and
all
the
time
everything
else
is
a
tertiary
consideration
merely
what
tertiary
asked
alice
third
said
the
hatter
to
come
in
third
it
a
combination
of
turtle
and
dromedary
illustration
requested
the
hatter
to
crack
a
filbert
for
him
just
at
this
moment
a
man
walking
through
the
car
stopped
and
requested
the
hatter
to
crack
a
filbert
for
him
which
the
hatter
cheerfully
did
the
thanked
him
and
paid
him
a
cent
which
the
hatter
immediately
rang
up
on
a
small
cash
register
on
his
vest
as
required
by
the
laws
of
blunderland
that
the
way
the
municipal
ownership
of
teeth
works
said
the
hatter
as
the
man
passed
on
and
then
he
resumed
this
street
railway
business
however
was
a
much
harder
proposition
than
the
municipal
ownership
of
teeth
when
we
took
the
railways
over
of
course
we
had
to
run
on
the
old
system
until
we
learned
the
business
the
first
thing
we
did
was
to
get
educated
men
for
motormen
and
conductors
polite
fellows
you
know
who
stop
a
car
when
you
asked
to
and
when
they
started
would
do
it
with
such
a
jerk
that
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
it
was
only
the
back
door
that
kept
the
car
from
being
yanked
clean
from
under
your
feet
letting
you
land
in
the
street
behind
i
know
said
alice
like
a
game
of
snap
the
whip
exactly
said
the
hatter
under
the
old
method
of
starting
a
car
you
never
knew
when
you
were
going
home
nights
whether
you
land
in
the
bosom
of
your
family
or
in
a
basket
of
eggs
somebody
was
bringing
home
from
market
so
we
advertised
for
polite
motormen
and
conductors
and
we
got
a
great
lot
of
them
mostly
retired
druggists
poets
and
fellows
like
that
with
a
few
thrown
in
to
give
tone
to
the
service
and
we
put
them
on
but
they
did
know
anything
about
motoring
unfortunately
somehow
or
other
good
manners
and
expert
motoring
did
seem
to
go
together
and
in
consequence
we
had
a
fearful
lot
of
collisions
at
first
i
do
think
there
was
a
whole
back
platform
in
the
outfit
at
the
end
of
the
week
no
matter
which
way
the
car
was
going
must
have
been
awful
said
alice
illustration
banged
into
the
car
ahead
it
was
said
the
hatter
and
the
public
began
to
complain
one
man
who
got
his
nose
pinched
between
two
cars
sued
us
for
damages
and
we
had
to
return
his
fare
finally
one
day
one
of
the
old
bobtail
cars
got
running
away
and
the
first
we
knew
it
banged
into
the
car
ahead
and
went
right
through
it
coming
out
in
front
still
going
like
mad
after
the
next
car
and
we
knew
something
had
to
be
done
mercy
cried
alice
i
should
think
the
passengers
in
the
first
car
would
have
sued
you
for
that
they
would
have
said
the
hatter
if
they
could
have
scraped
enough
of
themselves
together
again
to
appear
in
court
it
was
a
hard
problem
said
the
march
hare
the
hardest
ever
asserted
the
hatter
but
the
white
knight
there
gave
me
a
clue
to
the
solution
he
our
copperation
council
and
i
put
it
up
to
him
for
an
opinion
and
after
thinking
it
over
for
two
months
he
reported
the
only
way
to
prevent
collisions
said
he
is
to
cut
the
ends
off
the
cars
that
was
it
was
it
judge
he
added
turning
to
the
white
knight
yes
said
the
knight
only
i
put
it
in
poetry
my
precise
words
were
the
only
way
that
i
can
find
to
stop
this
car
colliding
stunt
is
cutting
off
the
end
behind
and
likewise
that
in
front
splendid
cried
alice
clapping
her
hands
in
glee
that
fine
thank
you
said
the
white
knight
you
see
miss
alice
i
made
a
personal
study
of
collisions
the
mayor
here
ordered
a
fresh
one
every
day
for
me
to
investigate
and
i
noticed
that
whenever
two
cars
bunked
into
each
other
it
was
always
at
the
ends
and
never
in
the
middle
the
conclusion
was
inevitable
the
ends
being
the
venerable
spot
abolish
them
a
very
careful
and
conscientious
public
servant
whispered
the
march
hare
aside
to
alice
when
we
have
municipal
ownership
of
the
federal
government
we
going
to
put
him
on
the
supreme
court
bench
he
means
vulnerable
when
he
says
venerable
but
you
must
mind
that
when
we
have
municipal
ownership
of
the
english
language
we
make
the
words
mean
what
we
want
to
illustration
the
chief
engineer
then
of
course
the
question
arose
as
to
how
we
could
do
this
said
the
hatter
i
got
the
chief
engineer
of
our
department
of
public
works
to
make
some
experiments
and
would
you
believe
it
when
we
cut
the
ends
on
the
cars
there
were
still
other
ends
left
no
matter
how
far
we
clipped
it
was
the
same
it
a
curious
scientific
fact
that
you
ca
cut
off
the
end
of
anything
and
leave
it
endless
we
tried
it
with
a
lot
of
things
cars
lengths
of
hose
coils
of
wire
rope
everything
we
could
think
of
always
with
the
same
result
ends
were
endless
but
nothing
else
was
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
multiplied
on
us
one
car
that
had
two
ends
when
we
began
was
cut
in
the
middle
and
then
was
found
to
have
four
ends
instead
of
two
that
so
is
it
cried
alice
illustration
it
came
to
me
like
a
flash
it
unquestionably
is
said
the
hatter
and
we
were
at
our
wits
ends
until
one
night
it
came
to
me
like
a
flash
i
had
gone
to
bed
on
a
park
bench
according
to
my
custom
of
using
nothing
that
is
not
owned
by
the
city
for
i
am
very
serious
about
this
thing
when
just
as
i
was
dozing
on
the
whole
scheme
unfolded
itself
build
a
circular
car
of
course
one
big
enough
to
go
all
around
the
city
that
would
solve
so
many
problems
with
only
one
car
there
be
no
car
ahead
which
always
irritates
people
who
miss
it
and
then
have
to
take
it
later
with
only
one
car
there
could
be
no
collisions
with
only
one
car
we
could
get
along
with
only
one
motorman
and
one
conductor
at
a
time
thus
giving
the
others
time
to
go
to
dancing
school
and
learn
good
manners
with
only
one
car
and
that
a
permanent
fixture
nobody
could
miss
it
if
it
did
move
we
could
economise
on
motive
power
and
even
bounce
the
motorman
without
injury
to
the
service
if
he
should
happen
to
be
impudent
to
the
board
of
aldermen
nobody
would
be
run
over
by
it
nobody
would
be
injured
getting
on
and
off
it
would
make
any
difference
if
the
motorman
did
see
the
passenger
who
wanted
to
get
aboard
being
circular
there
always
be
room
enough
to
go
around
and
there
be
no
front
or
back
platform
for
the
people
to
stand
on
or
get
thrown
off
of
going
round
the
curves
the
expenses
of
keeping
up
the
roadbed
would
be
nothing
because
being
motionless
the
car
jolt
even
if
it
ran
over
a
a
mile
high
and
best
of
all
a
circular
car
has
no
ends
to
collide
with
other
ends
which
makes
it
absolutely
safe
i
never
heard
of
a
car
colliding
with
itself
did
you
no
i
never
did
replied
alice
nor
i
neither
said
the
march
hare
i
do
think
it
ever
happened
and
therefore
i
reason
that
it
ai
going
to
happen
and
how
do
the
people
like
it
asked
alice
o
they
getting
to
like
it
replied
the
hatter
at
first
they
did
want
to
ride
on
the
thing
at
all
they
said
what
you
did
that
they
did
seem
to
be
getting
anywhere
and
they
hated
to
walk
home
but
after
awhile
we
proved
to
them
that
walking
was
a
very
healthful
exercise
and
on
rainy
nights
they
found
the
covered
car
a
good
deal
of
a
convenience
especially
when
under
the
old
system
of
private
ownership
of
umbrellas
they
had
left
their
bumbershoots
at
home
once
or
twice
they
lost
their
tempers
and
sassed
the
conductor
but
he
put
them
in
jail
for
lazy
majesty
a
german
disease
that
we
have
imported
for
the
purpose
as
an
officer
of
the
government
the
conductor
has
a
right
to
arrest
anybody
who
sasses
him
as
guilty
of
sedition
and
a
night
or
two
in
jail
takes
the
fun
out
of
that
have
you
had
any
elections
since
you
established
it
asked
alice
whose
father
had
once
run
for
mayor
and
who
therefore
knew
something
about
politics
no
said
the
hatter
with
an
easy
laugh
but
we
will
have
one
in
the
spring
we
shall
be
reëlected
all
right
how
do
you
know
asked
alice
if
the
people
do
like
municipal
ownership
o
but
they
do
said
the
march
hare
you
see
miss
alice
we
have
employed
a
safe
majority
of
the
voters
in
the
various
departments
of
our
system
their
terms
expiring
coincidentally
with
our
own
so
if
they
vote
against
us
they
vote
against
themselves
it
really
makes
municipal
ownership
he
means
perpetuating
whispered
the
march
hare
ah
said
alice
i
see
just
then
a
heavy
gong
like
a
huge
fire
alarm
sounded
and
all
the
passengers
sprang
to
their
feet
and
made
for
the
doors
what
that
cried
alice
timidly
as
she
rose
up
hurriedly
with
all
the
rest
do
be
alarmed
it
only
the
signal
that
our
time
is
up
said
the
hatter
we
must
get
out
now
and
make
room
for
others
who
may
wish
to
use
the
cars
nobody
can
monopolise
anything
under
our
system
i
will
now
take
you
to
see
our
gas
and
hot
air
plant
it
is
one
of
the
seven
wonders
of
the
world
and
the
little
party
descended
into
the
street
chapter
iii
the
aromatic
gas
plant
after
the
little
party
had
descended
from
the
marvellous
trolley
concerning
which
the
march
hare
observed
most
properly
that
under
private
ownership
nothing
so
safe
and
sane
would
ever
have
been
thought
of
they
walked
along
a
beautiful
highway
bordered
with
rosebushes
oleanders
and
geraniums
until
they
came
to
a
lovely
little
park
at
the
entrance
to
which
was
a
huge
sign
announcing
that
within
was
the
blunderland
gas
plant
to
tell
the
truth
alice
had
not
cared
particularly
to
visit
the
gas
works
because
she
had
once
been
driven
through
what
was
known
at
home
as
the
district
on
her
way
to
the
ferry
and
her
recollections
of
it
were
not
altogether
pleasant
as
she
recalled
it
it
was
in
a
rather
squalid
neighbourhood
and
the
odours
emanating
from
it
were
not
pleasing
to
what
she
called
her
but
here
in
blunderland
all
was
different
instead
of
the
huge
ugly
retorts
rising
up
out
of
the
ground
surrounded
by
a
quality
of
air
that
one
could
not
breathe
with
comfort
was
as
beautiful
a
garden
as
anyone
could
wish
to
wander
through
and
at
its
centre
there
stood
a
retort
but
not
one
that
looked
like
a
great
iron
skull
cap
painted
red
on
the
contrary
the
municipally
owned
retort
had
architecturally
all
the
classic
beauty
of
a
carnegie
library
we
call
it
the
retort
courteous
said
the
hatter
pridefully
as
he
gazed
at
the
structure
and
smiled
happily
as
he
noted
alice
very
evident
admiration
for
it
you
see
in
urban
affairs
as
a
mere
matter
of
fitness
we
believe
in
cultivating
urbanity
my
child
and
in
consequence
everything
we
do
is
conceived
in
a
spirit
of
courtesy
the
under
private
ownership
have
not
been
what
you
would
call
polite
they
were
almost
invariably
heavy
rude
staring
structures
that
reared
themselves
offensively
in
the
public
eye
and
our
first
effort
was
to
subliminate
whispered
the
march
hare
i
beg
your
pardon
hare
retorted
the
hatter
i
did
not
mean
which
means
to
suppress
but
subliminate
which
means
to
sublimify
or
make
sublime
i
guess
i
know
my
own
language
excuse
me
said
the
march
hare
meekly
i
have
studied
the
o
dictionary
beyond
the
letter
q
mayor
and
i
was
not
aware
that
the
common
council
had
as
yet
passed
favourably
upon
subliminate
either
he
added
with
some
feeling
that
is
because
it
was
not
until
yesterday
that
the
copperation
council
decided
that
subliminate
was
a
constitutional
word
said
the
hatter
sharply
in
view
of
his
report
to
me
which
i
wrote
myself
and
therefore
know
the
provisions
of
he
states
that
subliminate
is
a
perfectly
just
and
proper
word
involving
no
infringement
upon
the
rights
of
others
and
in
no
wise
impairing
the
value
of
innocent
vested
interests
and
is
therefore
legal
therefore
i
shall
use
it
whether
the
common
council
approves
it
or
not
if
they
resolve
that
it
is
not
a
good
word
i
shall
veto
the
resolution
if
you
do
like
it
i
send
you
your
resignation
that
being
the
case
said
the
march
hare
i
withdraw
my
objections
which
observed
the
hatter
triumphantly
turning
to
alice
shows
you
my
dear
young
lady
the
very
great
value
of
the
municipal
ownership
idea
as
applied
to
the
board
of
aldermen
as
the
white
knight
put
it
in
one
of
his
poetical
reports
printed
in
volume
of
the
copperation
council
opinions
for
october
page
a
city
may
not
own
its
gas
its
barber
shops
or
cars
it
may
not
raise
asparagrass
or
run
official
bars
it
may
not
own
a
big
hotel
or
keep
a
public
hen
but
it
will
always
find
it
well
to
own
its
aldermen
when
aldermen
were
owned
by
private
interests
the
public
interests
suffered
but
in
this
town
where
the
city
fathers
belong
to
the
city
they
have
to
do
what
the
city
tells
them
to
or
get
out
it
sounds
good
was
all
that
alice
could
think
of
to
say
what
i
was
trying
to
tell
you
when
the
alderman
interpolated
the
hatter
went
on
there
he
goes
again
growled
the
march
hare
was
that
the
first
thing
we
did
when
we
took
over
the
gas
plant
was
to
sublimify
the
externals
of
the
works
along
lines
of
architectural
and
olfactoreal
beauty
both
to
the
eye
and
to
the
nose
two
organs
of
the
human
structure
that
private
interests
seldom
pay
much
attention
to
i
asked
myself
two
questions
first
is
it
necessary
for
a
gas
works
to
be
ugly
second
is
it
necessary
for
gas
works
to
be
so
odourwhifferous
that
the
smell
of
the
automobile
is
a
dream
of
fragrant
beauty
alongside
of
it
to
both
these
questions
the
answer
was
plain
of
course
it
ai
beauty
can
be
applied
to
the
lines
of
a
just
as
readily
as
to
the
lines
of
a
hippopotamus
and
as
for
the
odours
they
are
due
to
the
fact
that
gas
as
it
is
now
made
does
not
smell
pleasantly
but
there
is
no
reason
why
it
should
not
be
so
manufactured
that
people
would
be
willing
to
use
it
on
their
handkerchiefs
i
learned
that
professor
burbank
of
california
had
developed
a
cactus
plant
that
could
be
used
for
a
sofa
cushion
why
i
asked
myself
could
he
not
develop
a
that
will
put
forth
flowers
the
perfume
of
which
should
make
that
of
the
violet
and
the
rose
sink
into
inoculated
desoupitude
it
hardly
seems
possible
does
it
said
alice
to
a
private
mind
it
presents
insuperable
difficulties
said
the
hatter
but
to
a
public
mind
like
my
own
nothing
is
impossible
if
a
man
can
do
a
seemingly
impossible
thing
with
one
plant
there
is
no
reason
why
he
should
do
a
seemingly
impossible
thing
with
another
plant
so
i
immediately
wrote
to
professor
burbank
offering
him
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
in
blunderland
deferred
debenture
gas
improvement
bonds
a
year
to
come
here
and
see
what
he
could
do
to
transmogrify
our
oh
i
am
so
glad
cried
alice
delightedly
i
should
so
love
to
meet
burbank
and
thank
him
for
inventing
the
coreless
apple
you
do
means
the
corliss
engine
do
you
asked
the
white
knight
well
i
sorry
said
the
hatter
but
burbank
would
come
unless
we
pay
him
real
money
which
although
we
do
publish
the
fact
broadcast
is
not
in
strict
accord
with
the
highest
principles
of
municipal
ownership
we
contend
that
when
people
work
for
the
common
weal
they
ought
to
be
satisfied
to
receive
their
pay
in
the
common
wealth
and
under
the
system
the
most
common
kind
of
wealth
is
represented
by
bonds
consequently
we
wrote
again
to
burbank
and
expressed
our
regret
that
a
man
of
his
genius
should
care
more
for
his
own
selfish
interests
than
for
the
public
weal
and
as
a
sort
of
sarcasm
on
his
meanness
i
enclosed
five
of
our
guaranteed
extension
four
per
cents
to
pay
for
the
stamp
he
had
put
upon
his
letter
what
are
the
guaranteed
extension
four
per
cents
asked
alice
illustration
studying
the
economic
theories
of
dr
wack
they
are
sinking
fund
bonds
payable
in
only
we
guarantee
to
extend
the
date
of
payment
to
in
case
the
sinking
fund
has
sunk
so
low
we
do
feel
like
paying
them
in
explained
the
hatter
it
an
ingenious
financial
idea
that
i
got
from
studying
the
economic
theories
of
wack
professor
of
repudiation
and
other
political
economies
at
the
wack
business
college
at
squantumville
florida
it
is
the
only
economic
theory
i
know
of
that
absolutely
prevents
debt
from
becoming
a
burden
but
that
aside
when
burbank
showed
that
he
preferred
fooling
with
such
futile
things
as
pineapples
and
hollyhocks
to
the
really
uplifting
work
of
providing
the
people
with
gas
that
was
redolent
of
the
spices
of
araby
i
resolved
to
do
the
thing
myself
he
is
a
man
of
real
inventive
genius
said
the
march
hare
anxious
apparently
to
square
himself
with
the
hatter
again
thank
you
alderman
said
the
hatter
it
is
a
real
pleasure
to
find
myself
strictly
in
accord
with
your
views
once
more
but
to
resume
miss
alice
as
i
say
i
resolved
to
tackle
the
problem
myself
fine
said
alice
so
you
went
in
and
studied
how
to
make
gas
the
old
way
and
then
not
at
all
interrupted
the
hatter
not
at
all
that
would
have
been
fatal
i
found
that
everybody
who
knew
how
to
make
gas
the
old
way
said
the
thing
was
impossible
hence
i
reasoned
the
man
who
will
find
it
possible
must
be
somebody
who
never
knew
anything
about
the
old
way
of
making
gas
and
nobody
in
the
whole
world
knew
less
about
it
than
manifestly
then
i
became
the
chosen
instrument
to
work
the
reform
so
i
plunged
in
and
you
really
ca
imagine
how
easy
it
all
turned
out
i
had
no
old
prejudices
in
to
overcome
no
set
finicky
ideas
to
serve
as
obstacles
to
progress
and
inside
of
a
week
i
had
it
i
filled
the
gas
tanks
half
full
of
cologne
and
then
pumped
hot
air
through
them
until
they
were
chock
full
i
figured
it
out
that
cologne
was
nothing
more
than
alcohol
flavoured
with
axiomatic
oils
aromatic
interrupted
the
march
hare
forgetting
himself
for
the
moment
illustration
the
white
knight
interfered
the
hatter
frowned
heavily
upon
the
alderman
and
there
is
no
telling
what
would
have
happened
had
not
the
white
knight
interfered
to
protect
the
offender
it
still
an
open
question
mayor
he
observed
if
axiomatic
applied
to
a
scent
is
constitutional
if
an
odour
should
become
axiomatic
we
could
never
get
rid
of
it
you
see
and
i
think
the
alderman
has
distinguished
authority
for
his
correction
which
o
very
well
said
the
hatter
let
it
go
i
prefer
axiomatic
but
the
private
predilections
of
an
official
should
not
be
permitted
to
influence
his
official
actions
i
intend
always
to
operate
within
the
limits
of
the
law
so
if
the
law
says
aromatic
aromatic
be
it
i
figured
that
cologne
was
nothing
more
than
alcohol
flavoured
with
aromatic
oils
and
that
inasmuch
as
both
alcohol
and
oil
burn
readily
there
was
no
reason
why
hot
air
passed
through
them
should
not
burn
also
and
carry
oil
some
of
the
aroma
as
well
it
certainly
was
a
very
pretty
idea
said
alice
all
the
ideas
are
pretty
said
the
march
hare
it
is
only
the
question
of
reducing
beauty
to
the
basis
of
practical
utility
that
confronts
us
and
how
did
it
work
asked
alice
very
much
interested
illustration
in
the
matter
of
perfume
it
was
fine
beautifully
said
the
hatter
only
it
would
burn
just
why
i
have
been
able
to
find
out
but
in
the
matter
of
perfume
it
was
fine
people
who
turned
on
their
jets
the
first
night
soon
found
their
houses
smelling
like
bowers
of
roses
and
a
great
many
of
them
liked
it
so
much
that
they
turned
on
every
jet
in
the
house
and
left
them
turned
on
all
day
so
that
in
the
mere
matter
of
consumption
twice
as
much
of
my
aromatic
illuminating
air
was
used
in
a
week
as
the
companies
had
charged
for
under
the
old
system
and
we
used
the
same
metres
too
in
addition
to
this
as
a
mere
device
my
invention
proved
to
have
a
wonderful
value
in
the
first
place
nobody
could
blow
it
out
and
be
found
the
next
morning
illustration
nobody
could
be
good
word
that
so
much
more
expressive
than
the
old
privately
owned
dictionary
word
asphyxiated
said
the
march
hare
the
hatter
nodded
his
appreciation
of
the
march
hare
compliment
and
admitted
him
once
more
to
his
good
graces
and
nobody
could
commit
suicide
with
it
the
way
they
used
to
do
with
the
old
kind
of
gas
because
you
see
it
was
after
all
only
hot
air
which
is
good
for
the
lungs
whichever
way
it
going
in
or
out
we
use
hot
air
all
the
time
in
our
administration
and
it
is
wonderful
what
results
you
can
get
from
it
he
went
on
but
it
would
light
in
fact
when
anybody
tried
to
light
it
such
was
the
pressure
it
blew
out
the
match
which
i
regard
as
an
additional
point
in
its
favour
if
we
have
gas
that
blows
out
matches
the
minute
the
match
is
applied
to
it
does
not
that
reduce
the
chance
of
fire
from
the
careless
habit
some
people
have
of
throwing
lighted
matches
into
the
it
most
certainly
does
said
the
white
knight
gravely
and
in
such
tones
of
finality
that
alice
did
not
venture
to
dispute
his
assertion
we
all
agreed
upon
that
point
said
the
hatter
but
there
were
complaints
of
course
some
people
mostly
capitalists
who
were
rich
enough
to
have
libraries
of
their
own
complained
that
they
read
nights
because
the
gas
would
light
i
replied
that
if
they
wanted
to
read
they
could
go
to
the
public
library
where
there
were
oil
lamps
and
electric
lights
besides
reading
at
night
is
bad
for
the
eyes
others
objected
that
they
could
see
to
go
to
bed
the
answer
to
that
was
simple
enough
people
do
need
to
see
to
go
to
bed
they
may
need
to
see
when
they
are
dressing
in
the
morning
but
when
they
go
to
bed
all
they
have
to
do
is
to
take
their
clothes
off
and
go
and
i
added
that
people
who
did
know
enough
to
do
that
had
better
have
nurses
finally
some
of
the
chief
kickers
got
up
a
and
protested
that
the
new
gas
was
gas
at
all
and
in
view
of
that
fact
refused
to
pay
their
gas
tax
oho
said
alice
that
was
pretty
serious
i
should
think
it
seemed
so
at
first
said
the
hatter
but
just
then
the
beauty
of
the
municipal
ownership
scheme
stepped
in
i
called
a
special
meeting
of
the
common
council
and
they
settled
the
question
once
for
all
good
cried
alice
how
did
they
do
it
they
passed
a
resolution
said
the
hatter
unanimously
declaring
the
aromatic
to
be
gas
of
the
most
excellent
quality
and
made
it
a
misdemeanor
for
anybody
to
say
that
it
was
i
signed
the
ordinance
and
from
that
minute
on
our
gas
was
gas
by
law
still
said
alice
those
people
had
already
said
it
was
did
they
back
down
most
of
did
laughed
the
hatter
and
the
rest
were
fined
apiece
and
sent
to
jail
for
six
months
you
see
we
made
the
law
sufficiently
retroactive
to
grab
the
whole
bunch
since
then
there
have
been
no
complaints
whereupon
the
hatter
invited
alice
to
stroll
through
the
with
him
which
the
little
girl
did
and
declared
it
later
to
have
been
sweeter
than
a
walk
through
a
which
causes
me
to
believe
that
the
mayor
scheme
was
a
pretty
wonderful
one
after
all
and
quite
worthy
of
a
hatter
thrust
by
the
vagaries
of
politics
into
the
difficult
business
of
gas
making
chapter
iv
the
police
after
alice
and
her
companions
had
enjoyed
the
aromatic
delights
of
the
blunderland
gas
plant
the
hatter
and
his
cabinet
went
into
executive
session
for
a
few
hours
to
decide
where
they
should
go
next
the
interests
of
blunderland
were
so
varied
that
this
was
a
somewhat
difficult
matter
to
settle
especially
as
alderman
march
hare
who
was
a
great
stickler
for
the
rights
of
the
honourable
body
to
which
he
belonged
wished
to
have
the
question
referred
to
a
special
meeting
of
the
common
council
the
white
knight
as
corporation
counsel
however
advised
the
hatter
that
there
was
no
warrant
in
law
compelling
him
to
accede
to
the
march

demand

municipal
ownership

the

to
choose

you

coldly
only

the

gleefully

the
march

with
dignity

the

meanwhile
alice
had
been
turned
over
to
the
chief
of
police
to
be
cared
for
and
was
charmed
to
discover
that
that
individual
was
none
other
than
her
old
friend
the
dormouse
whom
she
had
met
in
her
trip
through
wonderland
at
the
hatter
how
did
you
ever
come
to
be
chief
of
police
she
cried
delightedly
as
she
recognised
him
illustration
i
the
soundest
sleeper
in
town
i
the
soundest
sleeper
in
town
he
replied
with
a
yawn
so
they
made
me
head
of
the
force
you
see
young
lady
the
great
trouble
with
the
average
policeman
is
that
he
too
and
that
leads
to
graft
when
the
hatter
municipal
police
commission
looked
into
the
question
they
found
that
the
cop
who
spent
most
of
his
time
asleep
spent
less
of
his
time
clubbing
people
who
would
whack
up
with
him
on
the
profits
of
their
business
every
ossifer
who
has
been
convicted
of
petty
larceny
in
the
past
the
records
show
has
been
a
fellow
who
stayed
awake
most
of
the
time
and
no
ossifer
has
ever
yet
been
known
to
go
in
for
graft
or
get
a
record
for
clubbing
innocent
highwaymen
over
the
head
while
he
was
asleep
either
on
a
park
bench
or
in
an
alleyway
consequently
says
they
dormouse
who
wakes
up
only
on
every
fifth
thursday
in
february
will
make
the
best
police
ossifer
in
the
bunch
and
being
the
best
had
ought
to
be
chose
chief
hence
accordingly
it
became
thus
moreover
i
am
a
champion
tea
drinker
what
that
got
to
do
with
it
demanded
alice
everything
said
the
dormouse
rubbing
his
eyes
sleepily
every
blessed
thing
tea
drinking
is
one
of
our
hardest
duties
under
the
new
system
providing
for
the
municipal
ownership
of
everything
in
sight
including
the
cop
on
the
corner
you
see
when
the
city
grabbed
up
the
bakeries
and
the
trolleys
and
the
grand
opera
house
and
the
condensed
milk
factory
and
the
saw
mills
and
the
breakfast
food
jungles
all
envy
hatred
and
malice
disappeared
everybody
loved
his
neighbour
better
than
he
did
himself
or
his
wife
family
and
consequently
hence
there
was
therefore
no
crime
which
left
the
policeman
out
of
a
job
the
only
burglars
left
in
town
were
the
regularly
appointed
official
safecrackers
representing
the
municipal
ownership
of
petty
and
grand
larceny
the
only

left
were

the

asked
alice
if

it
they
went
out

said
the

i
should

benefit

his
head
with
his
club
to
keep
from
dropping
off
to
sleep
it
ai
for
the
benefit
of
their
families
it
for
the
benefit
of
the
city
a
city
like
this
can
use
benefits
to
great
advantages
most
all
the
time
but
you
see
the
results
of
municipalising
all
sorts
of
crime
from
straight
burglary
up
to
life
insurance
resulted
in
the
police
having
nothing
to
do
there
anybody
to
arrest
or
to
quell
or
to
club
and
so
they
turned
us
into
a
social
organisation
and
that
where
tea
drinking
comes
in
strong
every
afternoon
at
five
o
clock
tea
is
served
on
every
corner
in
blunderland
by
the
policeman
on
beat
they
have
become
quite
a
public
function
but
they
a
trifle
hard
on
the
police
who
do
care
for
tea
because
we
have
to
be
very
polite
and
take
it
with
everybody
who
comes
up
and
be
nice
and
chatty
into
the
bargain
in
addition
to
this
we
are
required
to
go
to
dances
and
take
care
of
the
and
make
ourselves
generally
agreeable
it
is
one
of
the
laws
of
blunderland
that
all
girls
are
born
free
and
equal
in
the
pursuit
of
life
liberty
and
german
favours
and
when
any
of
the
terpsichorean
force
finds
a
girl
with
red
hair
and
snub
nose
with
freckles
on
it
decorating
the
wall
and
being
neglected
at
a
cotillion
it
is
his
duty
to
plunge
in
and
either
dance
with
her
himself
or
put
some
willieboy
under
arrest
until
he
calls
her
out
and
gives
her
the
time
of
her
life
you
ca
imagine
what
wonderful
results
this
municipal
control
of
that
social
situation
has
done
in
the
line
of
popularising
plain
girls
it
sounds
very
interesting
alice
ventured
i
should
think
the
girls
would
like
it
they
do
said
the
dormouse
the
only
objection
to
it
comes
from
the
willieboys
but
nobody
cares
much
what
they
think
because
there
many
of
them
that
think
and
is
that
all
you
do
asked
alice
oh
no
indeed
said
the
dormouse
we
keep
reserves
for
bridge
parties
at
the
station
all
the
time
so
that
if
any
taxpayer
ever
needs
a
fourth
hand
to
make
up
a
game
all
he
has
to
do
is
to
ring
up
headquarters
and
get
an
ossifer
to
come
up
and
play
in
addition
to
this
we
look
after
old
ladies
who
want
to
go
shopping
and
are
strong
enough
to
break
through
the
rush
line
at
the
bargain
counters
and
then
once
in
a
while
somebody
baby
will
wake
up
at
three
in
the
morning
and
demand
the
moon
and
we
go
up
and
attend
to
it
what
cried
alice
in
amazement
you
do
mean
to
say
you
give
it
the
moon
not
exactly
said
the
dormouse
we
just
promise
to
give
it
one
of
the
strong
points
about
municipal
ownership
it
the
easiest
system
to
make
promises
under
you
ever
knew
you
can
promise
anything
and
later
on
if
you
do
make
good
you
can
promise
something
better
and
so
on
it
works
very
well
in
a
great
many
places
illustration
we
respond
immediately
to
the
call
but
that
is
really
what
we
go
up
to
the
house
for
we
go
up
to
relieve
the
poor
tired
parents
who
have
been
working
hard
all
day
and
are
too
weary
to
walk
up
and
down
the
floor
with
the
baby
we
respond
immediately
to
the
call
grab
up
the
baby
and
walk
the
floor
with
him
until
he
is
quiet
again
once
last
winter
a
chap
with
three
pairs
of
twins
six
months
a
year
and
a
half
and
three
years
old
respectively
had
to
send
for
the
patrol
wagon
all
six
of
waked
up
and
began
to
squall
at
once
and
we
sent
seven
ossifers
and
a
sergeant
up
to
look
after
them
they
had
to
parade
around
that
house
from
until
before
those
babies
quit
yelling
just
at
this
moment
the
dormouse
was
interrupted
in
his
story
by
a
raggedly
dressed
old
man
on
a
pair
of
crutches
who
begged
an
alms
of
him
only
a
dollar
sir
he
asked
piteously
only
a
dollar
to
relieve
a
terrible
case
of
distress
certainly
simpkins
said
the
dormouse
kindly
i
well
i
be
jiggered
he
added
feeling
through
his
pockets
i
must
have
left
my
money
at
home
maybe
this
young
lady
can
help
you
out
miss
alice
permit
me
to
introduce
you
to
simpkins
he
the
most
successful
beggar
in
nineteen
counties
glad
to
meet
you
said
alice
shaking
hands
with
simpkins
you
could
spare
a
dollar
could
you
miss
whined
the
beggar
it
will
relieve
a
terrible
case
of
distress
why
yes
said
alice
suddenly
remembering
that
she
had
a
silver
dollar
in
her
pocket
here
it
is
and
she
handed
it
to
simpkins
who
thanked
her
profusely
how
business
asked
the
dormouse
fine
said
simpkins
executing
a
jig
i
collected
since
eleven
this
morning
illustration
made
off
with
the
agility
of
an
antelope
whereupon
forgetting
his
crutches
he
made
off
up
the
street
with
the
agility
of
an
antelope
alice
gazed
after
him
in
wonder
i
i
did
suppose
you
had
any
beggars
in
blunderland
said
she
he
the
only
one
replied
the
dormouse
he
the
official
beggar
of
the
town
he
gets
in
tenth
deferred
reorganisation
certificates
a
year
which
if
the
certificates
pay
ten
cents
on
the
dollar
as
we
hope
will
turn
out
to
be
a
good
salary
in
the
end
but
why
does
he
beg
who
gets
the
money
asked
alice
the
city
said
the
dormouse
once
in
a
while
when
the
printing
plant
gets
clogged
up
with
large
orders
of
bonds
for
our
various
enterprises
the
city
has
to
get
hold
of
a
few
dollars
of
real
money
so
they
send
simpkins
out
for
it
i
believe
he
out
trying
to
raise
the
interest
on
the
sixteenth
mortgage
extension
bonds
on
the
municipal
cigarette
plant
purchased
year
before
last
it
ten
months
overdue
and
the
former
owners
have
asked
the
government
to
smoke
up
oh
said
alice
is
the
printing
plant
clogged
up
unmercifully
said
the
dormouse
not
to
say
teetotally
preparing
their
christmas
issues
in
magazine
form
and
that
means
a
terrible
lot
of
extra
work
i
do
believe
the
way
things
look
now
that
the
city
will
be
able
to
print
the
money
for
last
january
payroll
until
somewhere
around
the
next
fourth
of
july
and
if
that
the
case
poor
old
simpkins
will
either
have
to
work
overtime
or
get
a
deputy
assistant
beggars
to
put
the
town
in
funds
i
expecting
to
have
the
police
put
on
that
job
at
any
minute
alice
was
silent
for
a
moment
and
the
dormouse
went
on
what
do
you
think
of
the
municipal
ownership
of
the
police
idea
he
asked
it
fine
said
alice
but
i
thought
all
cities
owned
their
police
force
a
great
many
people
think
that
laughed
the
dormouse
but
it
so
it
is
in
new
york
and
chicago
i
heard
my
papa
say
so
once
said
alice
again
the
dormouse
laughed
well
he
said
i
do
want
to
cast
any
asparagus
on
your
intelligence
but
he
wrong
the
police
may
own
new
york
and
chicago
but
new
york
and
chicago
do
own
the
police
not
by
a
long
shot
who
does
then
demanded
alice
the
lord
only
knows
laughed
the
dormouse
some
people
say
john
doe
and
other
people
say
the
man
higher
up
but
which
it
is
or
who
either
of
may
be
i
have
the
slightest
idea
maybe
they
belong
to
the
copper
trust
and
then
with
a
sly
wink
at
the
little
maid
the
dormouse
turned
over
and
went
to
sleep
chapter
v
the
municipaphone
armed
with
the
copperation
counsel
opinion
authorising
him
to
do
whatever
he
pleased
next
the
hatter
decided
that
he
would
give
alice
a
demonstration
of
the
workings
of
the
municipaphone
illustration
you
can
talk
all
you
please
which
said
he
proudly
i
consider
to
be
the
most
democraticising
thing
i
have
ever
invented
you
can
talk
all
you
please
about
universal
brotherhood
unlimited
sisterhood
and
the
infinity
of
unclehood
but
all
of
these
movements
put
together
have
done
as
much
to
promote
the
equality
of
everybody
as
that
municipaphone
idea
of
mine
alice
thought
the
cheshire
cat
grin
expanded
slightly
as
the
hatter
spoke
but
she
was
not
sure
although
he
most
assuredly
did
wink
at
her
i
should
admire
to
see
it
she
said
what
is
it
just
it
is
the
result
of
the
municipal
ownership
of
the
telephone
returned
the
hatter
proudly
we
have
taken
over
everything
that
works
by
electricity
electric
lighting
the
telegraph
the
telephone
even
the
thunder
and
lightning
interrupted
the
white
knight
and
under
our
management
everything
runs
so
smoothly
that
even
the
lightning
does
strike
any
more
that
a
great
thing
in
municipal
ownership
there
are
any
more
strikes
under
it
what
he
says
is
true
my
child
said
the
hatter
and
in
time
we
expect
to
get
the
thunder
itself
under
control
so
that
it
will
serve
some
useful
purpose
i
do
know
yet
exactly
what
but
i
am
having
experiments
made
in
storage
batteries
which
will
catch
and
hold
the
thunder
with
the
idea
of
saving
the
noise
it
makes
for
or
presidential
salutes
or
other
things
and
occasions
where
the
fracturing
of
silence
seems
desirable
surely
if
we
can
take
electricity
and
under
suitable
municipal
supervision
make
it
serve
as
a
substitute
for
a
tallow
dip
why
should
we
extract
the
reverberance
with
which
it
is
fraught
to
add
to
the
general
clangour
of
joyous
occasions
no
reason
at
all
said
alice
i
wonder
no
one
has
ever
thought
of
that
before
just
think
of
all
the
magnificent
noises
that
go
to
waste
in
a
thunderstorm
you
will
discover
in
time
my
dear
child
that
only
under
the
municipal
ownership
of
brains
such
as
we
have
here
can
such
great
ideas
be
seized
from
the
infinity
of
nothingness
and
turned
into
an
irresistible
propaganda
said
the
hatter
loftily
he
the
biggest
gander
of
the
bunch
whispered
the
march
hare
but
it
is
what
we
are
going
to
do
but
what
we
have
done
that
we
propose
to
show
you
continued
the
hatter
eyeing
the
march
hare
coldly
and
as
i
have
said
the
municipaphone
is
my
crowning
achievement
just
come
here
and
i
will
show
you
the
hatter
led
alice
to
a
nearby
and
pointing
to
a
little
box
fastened
to
the
middle
of
the
pillar
explained
to
her
that
that
was
the
municipaphone
we
have
them
in
every
room
in
every
house
in
the
city
on
all
the
hydrants
telegraph
poles
in
fact
everywhere
where
there
is
a
chance
or
room
enough
to
hang
one
the
hatter
explained
it
just
like
a
telephone
is
it
said
alice
only
it
looks
like
a
hat
instead
of
a
funnel
exactly
said
the
hatter
but
we
do
call
it
a
telephone
any
more
the
word
telephone
struck
me
as
being
a
misnomer
you
do
tell
the
anything
when
you
talk
into
it
you
tell
the
person
at
the
other
end
of
the
line
and
so
i
changed
its
name
to
the
municipaphone
which
shows
that
it
a
that
belongs
to
the
city
just
to
sort
of
moralise
the
thing
i
had
the
changed
to
look
like
a
hat
instead
of
a
funnel
because
funnels
are
apt
to
suggest
alcoholic
beverages
and
sometimes
people
who
are
at
all
thirsty
are
made
so
by
the
mere
power
of
suggestion
the
hat
however
has
always
commended
itself
to
our
greatest
statesmen
as
a
vehicle
best
suited
for
the
transmission
of
ideas
and
i
therefore
adopted
it
it
is
very
pretty
commented
alice
only
i
think
a
few
ribbons
would
improve
it
a
little
possibly
said
the
hatter
we
have
had
time
yet
to
look
after
the
millinery
aspect
of
the
situation
but
we
take
that
up
at
our
next
cabinet
meeting
i
thank
you
for
the
suggestion
but
you
see
how
the
thing
works
this
little
book
here
has
a
list
of
the
names
of
everybody
in
town
with
their
municipaphone
numbers
attached
the
lowly
as
well
as
the
highly
from
the
newsboy
up
to
the
bridge
whist
set
are
all
represented
here
so
that
all
are
connected
in
one
way
or
another
with
each
other
there
is
no
man
woman
or
child
so
poor
and
humble
of
birth
that
he
or
she
can
not
get
into
immediate
relations
with
the
haughty
and
proud
everybody
is
on
speaking
terms
with
everybody
else
and
we
have
thereby
reached
socially
a
condition
wherein
all
men
though
not
related
are
nevertheless
connected
you
frequently
hear
a
remark
that
while
she
has
not
met
van
varick
van
astorbilt
or
willieboy
de
crudoil
personally
they
are
nevertheless
connections
of
hers
if
not
by
blood
or
marriage
at
least
by
wire
which
is
stronger
than
either
some
day
instead
of
having
societies
of
the
cincinnati
and
sons
and
daughters
of
the
revolution
i
hope
to
see
associations
of
brothers
and
sisters
of
the
municipaphone
which
shall
become
a
factor
of
overwhelming
solidarity
in
all
social
and
political
affairs
it
a
splendid
scheme
said
alice
it
is
a
tie
of
material
strength
which
binds
together
our
first
and
last
families
increasing
the
pride
of
the
latter
and
diminishing
that
of
the
former
until
we
have
at
last
reached
an
average
of
which
knows
no
barriers
of
class
distinction
said
the
hatter
but
it
would
have
worked
if
we
had
formulated
strict
rules
by
which
every
household
in
town
is
governed
one
of
our
rules
is
that
the
person
called
upon
must
answer
immediately
and
truthfully
any
question
which
the
person
at
the
other
end
asks
and
of
course
in
perfectly
polite
language
for
instance
suppose
you
try
it
yourself
just
ring
up
number
bloomingdale
and
ask
for
van
livingston
smythe
she
the
biggest
swell
in
town
ask
her
anything
that
comes
into
your
head
and
you
see
how
it
works
tell
her
you
are
the
head
of
the
municipal
laundry
alice
took
her
place
at
the
municipaphone
and
called
bloomingdale
as
instructed
hello
she
said
hush
do
say
that
say
ah
there
interrupted
the
hatter
hello
comes
under
the
head
of
profanity
which
is
against
the
law
excuse
me
said
alice
ah
there
she
added
give
me
bloomingdale
please
central
name
please
said
central
bridget
replied
alice
address
asked
central
tub
municipal
laundry
said
alice
occupation
continued
the
other
wringer
laughed
alice
all
right
there
you
are
said
central
making
the
desired
connection
is
this
van
livingston
smythe
asked
alice
yes
said
a
sweet
voice
from
the
other
end
of
the
line
what
is
it
i
am
bridget
said
alice
of
the
municipal
laundry
and
i
wanted
to
ask
was
your
grandfather
ever
a
monkey
it
was
not
a
very
polite
question
but
under
the
excitement
of
the
moment
alice
could
think
of
nothing
better
to
ask
i
do
believe
so
came
the
sweet
voice
in
answer
i
have
looked
over
every
branch
of
our
family
tree
and
there
is
a
cocoanut
on
it
why
are
you
looking
for
a
missing
grandfather
of
your
own
no
smiled
alice
but
i
read
all
the
books
in
the
public
library
and
i
thought
he
might
have
a
tail
to
tell
that
i
would
find
amusing
well
i
very
sorry
said
the
sweet
voice
grandfather
died
forty
years
ago
so
i
do
believe
he
can
help
you
i
would
advise
you
to
go
up
to
the
monkeyhouse
and
ask
one
of
your
own
brothers
said
alice
well
asked
the
hatter
with
a
grin
what
do
you
think
of
it
why
it
perfectly
wonderful
said
alice
if
that
were
to
happen
in
new
york
or
even
in
brooklyn
or
binghamton
van
livingston
smythe
would
have
been
very
indignant
not
only
over
the
question
but
for
the
mere
fact
that
the
er
dared
ring
her
up
at
all
exactly
said
the
hatter
with
a
bland
smile
of
satisfaction
this
municipaphone
controlled
by
strict
rules
which
people
must
obey
is
a
great
social
leveller
but
why
did
central
want
my
name
and
address
asked
alice
because
central
has
to
keep
a
record
of
all
that
everybody
says
for
the
inspector
of
personal
communications
explained
the
hatter
every
word
you
and
smythe
spoke
was
recorded
at
the
central
office
and
if
either
of
you
had
used
any
expression
stronger
than
fudge
or
o
tutt
you
would
have
been
fined
five
dollars
for
each
expression
and
repetition
thereof
we
expect
to
establish
civic
control
of
public
and
private
speech
within
the
next
year
and
we
have
begun
it
with
supervision
of
the
municipaphone
but
cried
alice
if
i
had
said
something
that
required
a
fine
would
who
is
innocent
have
had
to
pay
illustration
fined
five
dollars
yes
said
the
hatter
but
in
all
cases
where
the
public
welfare
is
concerned
private
interests
must
yield
however
great
the
hardship
that
is
one
of
the
fundamental
principles
of
municipal
ownership
would
have
to
suffer
in
order
that
the
great
principle
involved
in
polite
speech
for
all
classes
might
prevail
the
strict
enforcement
of
our
legislation
has
resulted
almost
in
the
complete
elimination
of
profane
speech
in
blunderland
so
much
so
in
fact
that
in
the
new
dictionary
we
are
compiling
such
words
as
golramit
dodgastit
and
goshallhemlocks
are
being
left
out
altogether
illustration
the
dictionary
we
are
compiling
it
is
a
great
moral
agency
said
the
white
knight
it
increases
the
of
the
submerged
curbs
the
pride
of
the
rich
and
holds
in
complete
subjection
those
evil
communications
which
corrupt
good
manners
and
nothing
but
the
result
of
municipal
ownership
put
in
the
march
hare
enthusiastically
forgetting
his
grouch
for
a
moment
it
has
other
advantages
too
said
the
hatter
to
which
i
feel
i
should
call
your
attention
these
phones
being
in
every
room
in
town
with
which
anybody
may
be
connected
at
any
moment
and
thus
overhear
what
other
people
are
saying
gossip
is
gradually
dying
out
and
people
everywhere
are
more
careful
of
what
they
say
even
in
private
for
nowadays
the
walls
literally
have
ears
to
give
you
an
example
i
will
connect
you
at
once
with
the
home
of
the
duchess
whom
you
met
if
you
remember
in
your
journey
through
wonderland
and
you
may
judge
for
yourself
of
how
useful
this
municipaphone
is
to
us
in
ascertaining
the
general
trend
of
public
opinion
illustration
alice
transfixed
at
the
phone
the
hatter
gave
the
order
to
central
and
in
a
minute
alice
stood
transfixed
at
the
phone
listening
intently
she
recognised
the
voice
of
the
duchess
immediately
illustration
the
biggest
jackass
from
dan
to
beersheba
as
for
that
old
fool
of
a
hatter
she
was
saying
he
is
the
biggest
jackass
from
dan
to
beersheba
well
said
the
hatter
can
you
hear
her
yes
giggled
alice
very
plainly
what
does
she
say
asked
the
hatter
simpering
why
said
alice
reddening
she
she
talking
about
you
the
dear
duchess
ejaculated
the
hatter
with
a
foolish
smirk
very
much
afraid
ahem
that
the
duchess
has
her
eye
on
me
she
has
said
alice
she
is
referring
to
you
in
the
warmest
tones
she
thinks
you
big
great
the
very
greatest
from
dan
to
beersheba
ah
me
sighed
the
hatter
if
i
were
only
a
younger
man
they
make
a
match
of
it
yet
said
the
white
knight
in
a
soft
whisper
to
alice
yes
sneered
the
march
hare
who
had
overheard
jealously
and
a
fine
old
lucifer
of
a
match
it
will
be
too
well
it
all
very
nice
said
alice
very
anxious
to
change
the
subject
but
i
ca
say
that
i
sure
i
like
it
why
you
ca
have
any
secrets
from
anybody
and
why
should
you
wish
to
my
dear
child
asked
the
hatter
coming
out
of
his
dream
of
romance
why
not
so
order
your
life
that
you
have
no
need
for
secrecy
yes
said
alice
i
suppose
that
is
better
but
then
hatter
is
there
to
be
any
more
private
life
not
under
municipal
ownership
said
the
hatter
carried
to
its
logical
conclusion
that
with
all
other
private
rights
will
be
merged
in
the
glorious
culmination
of
a
complete
well
rounded
municipal
life
it
is
toward
that
grand
civic
eventuation
that
i
and
my
associates
in
this
noble
movement
are
constantly
striving
are
you
going
to
have
municipal
control
of
marriage
asked
alice
slyly
the
hatter
blushed
and
smiled
foolishly
i
ah
am
thinking
about
that
he
said
with
a
funny
little
laugh
it
would
be
a
most
excellent
thing
to
do
for
in
my
opinion
a
great
many
people
nowadays
get
married
too
thoughtlessly
just
because
they
happen
to
love
each
other
they
go
off
and
get
married
but
under
municipal
control
it
would
be
much
more
difficult
for
a
man
or
a
woman
to
take
so
serious
a
step
for
instance
if
i
had
my
way
the
common
council
would
have
to
be
asked
for
permission
for
a
man
to
marry
the
question
would
come
up
in
the
form
of
a
bill
which
would
immediately
be
referred
to
the
committee
on
matrimony
who
would
discuss
it
very
thoroughly
before
bringing
it
before
the
council
if
a
majority
of
the
committee
considered
that
the
application
should
be
granted
then
the
matter
should
be
placed
before
the
whole
council
by
which
it
should
be
debated
in
open
public
sessions
the
applicant
having
been
invited
to
appear
and
under
by
the
district
attorney
demonstrate
his
fitness
to
be
married
all
others
knowing
any
reason
why
he
should
not
be
married
should
also
have
the
opportunity
to
appear
and
state
their
reasons
for
opposing
the
granting
of
the
application
i
am
inclined
to
believe
that
this
would
put
a
stop
to
these
hasty
marriages
which
have
given
rise
to
that
beautiful
proverb
married
in
camden
repent
at
south
dakota
i
should
think
it
would
said
alice
and
when
do
you
propose
to
start
this
plan
along
well
you
see
said
the
hatter
with
a
giggle
before
i
take
final
steps
in
the
matter
i
wish
to
have
a
few
words
with
er
well
you
know
who
i
the
duchess
alice
ventured
ah
you
precocious
child
cried
the
hatter
tapping
alice
on
the
shoulder
coyly
you
must
not
believe
all
you
overhear
the
duchess
say
about
me
she
is
so
prejudiced
and
blind
to
my
faults
i
i
almost
sorry
i
connected
you
with
her
over
the
municipaphone
chapter
vi
the
department
of
public
verse
i
think
said
the
hatter
that
before
we
go
any
further
we
would
better
show
miss
alice
our
municipal
poetry
factory
the
whistle
will
blow
very
shortly
and
our
divine
afflatus
dynamo
will
shut
down
so
if
she
is
to
see
that
feature
of
our
work
now
is
the
time
to
do
it
yes
said
the
march
hare
although
the
office
is
in
some
confusion
owing
to
your
recent
municipal
order
number
making
rhyme
with
and
extending
the
number
of
lines
in
the
municipal
quatrains
from
four
to
the
employees
are
finding
considerable
difficulty
in
making
quatrains
and
at
least
half
the
force
have
gone
home
suffering
from
acute
attacks
of
brainstormitis
it
do
em
good
laughed
the
hatter
a
good
brain
storm
may
result
in
a
few
of
them
being
struck
come
along
miss
alice
and
we
show
you
our
city
poets
at
work
i
do
think
i
understand
said
alice
what
is
a
city
poet
illustration
larger
measure
than
was
the
custom
he
bears
the
same
relation
to
municipal
poetry
that
a
white
wing
bears
to
the
street
cleaning
department
explained
the
hatter
two
years
ago
the
city
took
over
all
the
enterprises
of
blunderland
appointed
a
municipalaureat
otherwise
a
commissioner
of
public
verse
and
started
him
along
with
a
department
he
employs
poets
who
provide
all
the
poetry
that
is
consumed
by
our
people
it
has
resulted
in
great
good
for
everybody
poetry
is
cheaper
by
eight
cents
a
line
than
it
used
to
be
and
as
you
may
have
guessed
from
what
the
march
hare
has
just
said
we
give
larger
measure
than
was
the
custom
under
the
private
ownership
of
quatrains
have
been
increased
from
four
lines
to
and
the
old
stingy
sonnet
has
been
enlarged
to
lines
we
have
also
passed
an
ordinance
requiring
that
poems
shall
say
what
they
mean
which
is
a
vast
improvement
on
the
old
private
control
method
whereunder
anybody
was
allowed
to
write
rhymes
which
nobody
could
understand
like
that
thing
of
miss
arethusa
spink
for
instance
called
aspiration
remember
that
i
do
think
i
ever
heard
it
said
alice
well
it
went
this
way
said
the
hatter
and
striking
a
graceful
attitude
he
recited
the
following
lines
called
aspiration
arethusa
down
by
the
purple
opalescent
sea
flung
like
a
ribbon
limp
athwart
the
sky
a
rose
lay
blooming
on
the
restless
lea
while
sundry
birds
came
chattering
sweetly
by
was
then
my
soul
that
all
too
long
had
slept
awoke
from
out
its
iridescent
nap
crept
down
where
the
crocus
blossoms
from
out
fair
nature
lap
and
cried
aloud
alas
what
hath
betode
what
dream
is
this
that
like
the
ambient
brook
forbids
the
mind
to
face
the
solemn
goad
and
know
itself
forsook
the
hatter
paused
well
said
alice
slightly
puzzled
that
all
there
was
to
it
said
the
hatter
it
was
printed
in
one
of
our
magazines
and
within
hours
the
ambulance
from
the
insane
asylum
was
called
out
times
by
people
who
had
gone
crazy
trying
to
find
out
what
it
meant
it
capped
the
climax
i
called
a
special
meeting
of
the
common
council
to
take
the
matter
up
purely
as
a
matter
of
public
health
and
before
i
went
to
bed
that
night
they
had
passed
and
i
had
signed
an
act
giving
the
control
of
the
verse
industry
to
the
city
and
taking
it
out
of
the
hands
of
irresponsible
unlicensed
independent
poets
and
a
good
job
it
was
too
said
the
march
hare
and
you
chose
one
of
the
best
poets
in
town
for
the
commissioner
i
suppose
suggested
alice
no
we
did
said
the
hatter
i
did
want
any
moonshine
in
a
city
department
and
no
poet
is
a
good
business
man
i
picked
out
a
very
successful
haberdasher
in
the
sixth
ward
for
the
delicate
business
of
organising
the
department
and
he
has
done
most
excellent
work
we
found
that
just
as
a
first
class
confectioner
made
a
splendid
manager
of
our
gas
plant
and
a
successful
merchant
had
the
required
push
to
keep
our
trolley
systems
going
so
the
haberdasher
had
the
precise
kind
of
genius
to
manage
the
poets
he
wo
stand
any
nonsense
from
them
and
any
poem
that
he
ca
understand
is
immediately
thrown
into
the
civic
taken
to
the
municipal
ferry
and
used
for
fuel
to
run
the
boats
i
guess
we
burn
nineteen
tons
of
refuse
verse
a
day
do
we
alderman
about
that
on
the
average
said
the
march
hare
sometimes
it
gets
as
high
as
twenty
tons
and
occasionally
it
falls
off
to
sixteen
but
using
these
rejected
manuscripts
in
place
of
coal
has
reduced
the
loss
on
the
ferry
about
dollars
a
year
in
real
money
how
much
is
that
in
bonds
asked
alice
slyly
o
let
see
said
the
hatter
his
face
getting
very
red
well
i
should
say
on
a
basis
of
to
one
dollars
would
come
to
about
in
third
debenture
ten
per
cent
certificates
exclusive
of
the
cost
of
printing
advertising
and
the
number
we
give
away
as
sample
copies
quite
a
saving
said
alice
yes
said
the
hatter
we
save
all
we
can
economy
in
real
money
is
our
watchword
we
never
spend
a
cent
where
a
bond
will
serve
the
purpose
illustration
greeted
by
the
commissioner
the
haberdasher
by
this
time
alice
and
her
hosts
had
reached
the
building
occupied
by
the
department
of
public
verse
and
upon
entering
its
spacious
doorway
the
party
were
greeted
by
the
commissioner
the
haberdasher
to
whom
alice
was
promptly
introduced
he
reminded
her
very
forcibly
of
her
old
acquaintance
bill
the
lizard
but
she
was
not
sure
enough
on
this
point
to
recall
their
previous
meeting
when
she
had
so
tactlessly
kicked
him
up
through
the
chimney
flue
of
the
wonderland
cottage
well
commissioner
said
the
hatter
how
are
you
getting
along
pretty
well
mayor
replied
the
commissioner
we
just
finished
the
six
line
couplet
for
the
new
chewing
gum
bonds
good
said
the
hatter
how
does
it
go
rather
neatly
i
think
said
the
commissioner
and
he
read
the
following
we
promise
to
pay
this
bond
some
day
if
of
the
stuff
we
got
enough
and
if
we
have
pray
do
despond
for
we
pay
it
off
with
another
bond
fine
said
the
hatter
you
strike
a
very
lofty
note
in
that
and
how
do
the
new
limericks
work
we
finished
number
of
series
xzv
said
the
commissioner
send
for
wiggins
who
wrote
it
and
let
him
read
it
to
you
himself
a
pressure
of
an
electric
button
brought
the
smiling
wiggins
into
the
office
wiggins
the
mayor
would
like
to
hear
that
new
limerick
of
yours
said
the
commissioner
illustration
it
runs
this
way
your
honour
thanky
sir
said
wiggins
it
runs
this
way
your
honour
there
was
an
old
lady
named
jane
who
sat
on
a
fence
at
schoharie
a
rooster
came
by
and
crew
like
the
deuce
but
jane
never
scared
for
a
cent
that
great
said
the
hatter
do
you
think
so
miss
alice
why
yes
said
alice
but
does
it
rhyme
perfectly
replied
the
hatter
that
is
under
our
system
when
we
organised
this
department
to
facilitate
business
and
avoid
the
waste
of
time
looking
for
rhymes
we
legalised
such
rhymes
as
schoharie
and
cent
and
by
and
deuce
by
that
act
we
found
that
where
one
man
could
only
turn
out
limericks
a
day
under
the
old
system
any
can
write
in
the
same
number
of
hours
that
very
good
wiggins
he
added
turning
to
the
workman
i
shall
recommend
the
commissioner
to
promote
you
to
an
inspectorship
in
the
sonnet
works
thanky
sir
said
the
poet
as
he
blushingly
bowed
himself
out
illustration
our
thinking
department
here
said
the
commissioner
opening
a
door
leading
into
a
long
darkened
chamber
here
young
lady
is
our
thinking
department
alice
passed
into
the
darkness
and
dimly
made
out
a
half
a
hundred
individuals
sitting
in
comfortable
morris
chairs
their
forefingers
pressed
hard
against
their
brows
and
their
eyes
gazing
fixedly
out
into
space
these
men
and
women
think
the
thoughts
which
our
municipal
poetry
is
designed
to
express
the
commissioner
continued
a
thought
once
seized
by
any
one
of
them
is
written
down
upon
a
pad
and
then
taken
into
this
next
room
where
it
is
classified
and
assigned
to
the
line
cutters
who
turn
out
the
first
draft
in
the
rough
then
when
this
is
done
it
is
sent
to
the
rhyming
room
where
the
lines
are
made
to
end
in
rhymes
and
finally
it
goes
to
the
polishing
room
where
the
poem
is
made
ready
for
publication
it
a
wonderful
system
said
the
hatter
it
not
only
improves
the
quality
of
our
poetry
but
in
campaign
times
it
is
a
great
help
since
we
control
absolutely
all
the
campaign
poetry
when
i
run
for
mayor
next
fall
to
succeed
myself
there
wo
be
a
single
poem
written
on
the
other
side
that
ought
to
be
a
great
help
said
alice
yes
said
the
hatter
it
will
be
every
employee
in
this
department
will
not
only
vote
for
me
but
will
work
for
me
as
well
same
way
in
the
gas
plant
and
the
trolley
in
fact
in
all
the
city
departments
it
is
only
another
evidence
of
the
very
great
value
of
municipal
ownership
it
is
uncertainty
in
political
times
that
upsets
business
but
with
the
municipality
in
control
of
all
these
departments
from
gas
to
poetry
there
is
no
uncertainty
about
who
will
win
so
that
business
is
not
unsettled
by
it
wonderful
said
alice
by
the
way
commissioner
you
better
start
the
rhyming
bureau
on
the
search
for
rhymes
to
hatter
at
once
said
the
mayor
we
want
to
be
caught
unprepared
at
the
last
minute
the
list
is
being
compiled
now
replied
the
commissioner
we
already
have
matter
batter
tatter
smatter
patter
ratter
spatter
and
scatter
fine
chortled
the
hatter
do
forget
chatter
put
in
alice
thank
you
i
make
a
note
of
it
said
the
commissioner
and
snatter
growled
the
march
hare
gloomily
who
evidently
felt
that
somebody
ought
to
be
looking
for
rhymes
to
march
hare
as
well
what
does
snatter
mean
demanded
the
hatter
frowning
it
a
corrupt
form
for
snatcher
retorted
the
march
hare
one
who
snatches
everything
he
can
lay
his
hands
on
without
regard
to
whether
it
his
by
divine
right
or
not
i
guess
they
can
use
it
in
poems
calling
attention
to
your
civic
virtues
except
by
unanimous
vote
of
the
common
council
over
my
veto
snatter
stays
out
of
the
municipal
vocabulary
returned
the
hatter
coldly
your
own
confession
that
it
is
corrupt
is
enough
to
condemn
it
with
me
i
would
use
batter
either
mayor
said
the
commissioner
batter
is
dough
and
we
have
got
any
worth
mentioning
it
is
also
to
whack
slam
bang
bust
smack
retorted
the
hatter
so
your
recommendation
is
not
accepted
seems
to
me
i
can
almost
hear
the
campaign
clubs
singing
as
they
march
o
the
noble
noble
hatter
ai
he
grand
how
his
enemies
do
scatter
thro
the
land
how
his
foemen
he
doth
batter
with
their
idle
gloomy
chatter
on
this
muni
cipal
matter
beats
the
band
o
gee
ejaculated
the
march
hare
do
you
call
that
poetry
sir
i
call
it
truth
returned
the
hatter
and
poetry
is
truth
just
as
art
is
truth
and
if
you
do
believe
it
all
you
got
to
do
is
to
try
and
run
against
me
next
fall
on
that
issue
i
beat
you
to
a
of
course
you
will
sighed
the
march
hare
but
you
would
but
for
that
last
ordinance
you
jammed
through
while
i
was
off
on
my
vacation
what
was
that
demanded
the
hatter
giving
the
election
commission
absolute
control
over
the
votes
and
then
appointing
yourself
election
commissioner
said
the
march
hare
i
do
believe
that
municipal
control
of
the
ballot
is
constitutional
well
it
will
be
constitutional
said
the
hatter
drily
when
demanded
the
march
hare
when
we
secure
municipal
control
of
the
constitution
said
the
hatter
i
make
it
constitutional
if
i
have
to
rewrite
the
whole
blessed
constitution
myself
whereupon
the
hatter
walked
majestically
forth
into
the
street
once
more
and
alice
and
the
march
hare
together
with
the
white
knight
followed
meekly
in
his
train
chapter
vii
ownership
of
children
what
time
is
it
asked
the
hatter
suddenly
turning
to
the
white
knight
six
replied
the
white
knight
looking
at
his
watch
mercy
cried
alice
i
had
no
idea
it
was
so
late
i
shall
have
to
run
along
home
it
supper
time
the
hatter
laughed
o
as
for
that
he
said
there
no
hurry
under
our
present
system
of
municipal
ownership
of
everything
i
can
issue
as
mayor
a
general
order
postponing
the
municipal
supper
hour
to
seven
or
eight
o
clock
still
if
you
prefer
to
go
home
i
do
want
to
said
alice
courteously
but
i
think
i
better
my
mother
would
be
worried
not
finding
me
in
the
nursery
you
see
i
left
home
without
telling
anybody
where
i
was
going
again
the
hatter
laughed
what
foolishness
he
ejaculated
that
the
great
trouble
with
the
private
ownership
of
children
it
worries
their
poor
mothers
keeps
from
their
daily
bridge
parties
interferes
with
that
freedom
of
action
which
is
guaranteed
to
the
individual
by
the
contravention
of
the
united
states
constitution
i
guess
you
mean
suggested
alice
it
used
to
be
the
constitution
returned
the
hatter
but
now
it
the
contravention
it
has
been
contravened
so
often
in
the
past
few
years
that
our
reformed
language
commission
at
washington
has
named
it
accordingly
it
simply
bears
out
what
you
said
in
your
message
approving
the
public
ownership
of
children
act
passed
by
the
common
council
last
november
which
i
wrote
for
you
and
consequently
consider
a
very
able
document
said
the
white
knight
the
public
ownership
of
children
cried
alice
with
a
look
of
alarm
on
her
face
yes
said
the
hatter
just
as
the
nation
has
gone
in
for
paternalism
we
here
in
blunderland
have
gone
in
for
maternalism
the
children
here
belong
to
the
city
but
alice
began
now
do
bother
said
the
hatter
kindly
it
works
very
well
it
has
reduced
children
to
a
state
of
scientific
control
which
is
as
careful
and
as
effective
as
that
of
the
street
cleaning
department
or
the
public
parks
and
it
has
emancipated
the
mothers
as
well
as
materially
decreased
the
financial
obligations
of
the
fathers
alice
lip
quivered
slightly
and
she
began
to
feel
a
little
bit
afraid
of
the
hatter
i
want
to
go
home
she
whimpered
certainly
as
you
wish
said
the
hatter
we
take
you
there
at
once
come
along
reassured
by
the
hatter
kindly
manner
alice
took
her
outstretched
hand
and
they
walked
along
the
highway
together
until
they
came
to
a
handsome
apartment
house
fronting
upon
a
beautiful
park
where
the
hatter
pressed
an
electric
button
at
one
side
of
the
massive
entrance
the
response
to
the
bell
was
immediate
and
alice
was
pleased
to
find
that
the
person
to
answer
was
none
other
than
the
duchess
herself
why
said
the
duchess
affably
glad
to
see
you
again
miss
alice
thank
you
said
alice
it
is
very
nice
to
be
here
do
you
live
in
this
beautiful
building
yes
said
the
duchess
you
see
i
just
been
appointed
commissioner
of
maternity
i
what
you
might
call
the
official
mother
of
the
town
since
that
great
statesman
the
hatter
here
the
duchess
winked
graciously
at
the
march
hare
devised
his
crowning
achievement
in
the
municipal
control
of
the
children
and
appointed
me
to
be
the
head
of
the
department
i
have
been
stationed
here
and
a
mighty
good
old
mother
she
is
ejaculated
the
hatter
with
fervour
palaverer
said
the
duchess
coyly
not
at
all
said
the
hatter
i
speak
not
as
a
man
but
as
a
mayor
and
what
i
say
is
to
be
construed
as
an
official
tribute
to
a
faithful
and
deserving
public
servant
servant
sir
repeated
the
duchess
haughtily
in
the
american
sense
said
the
hatter
with
a
low
bow
in
the
sense
that
the
servant
is
as
good
as
if
not
better
than
the
employer
madam
that
man
a
perfect
dipsomaniac
said
the
march
hare
diplomat
man
diplomat
corrected
the
white
knight
a
dipsomaniac
is
a
very
different
thing
from
a
diplomat
consuls
may
be
dipsomaniacs
but
a
diplomat
is
a
man
worthy
of
ambassadorial
honours
oh
i
see
said
the
march
hare
well
he
a
diplomat
all
right
all
right
how
are
things
going
duchess
asked
the
hatter
children
happy
they
will
be
in
time
said
the
duchess
so
many
of
them
have
been
brought
up
so
far
on
the
home
system
that
it
is
hard
to
introduce
the
new
blunderland
method
without
friction
i
was
afraid
of
that
said
the
hatter
how
does
the
compulsory
regulation
work
splendidly
said
the
duchess
since
i
started
in
in
january
to
make
the
children
drink
five
glasses
of
vanilla
cream
soda
every
day
as
a
matter
of
routine
and
duty
sixty
per
cent
of
them
have
come
to
hate
it
i
think
that
by
the
end
of
the
year
we
shall
have
stamped
out
the
love
of
soda
almost
entirely
the
same
way
with
caramels
and
other
candies
in
place
of
beef
we
have
caramels
for
breakfast
for
dinner
and
marshmallows
for
tea
regularly
and
last
night
seventeen
of
the
children
presented
a
petition
asking
for
beefsteak
mutton
chops
and
boiled
rice
i
have
a
firm
conviction
that
when
the
new
law
requiring
beef
to
be
sold
at
candy
stores
and
compelling
those
in
charge
of
the
young
to
teach
them
that
boiled
rice
and
hominy
are
bad
for
the
teeth
goes
into
effect
we
shall
find
the
children
clamouring
for
wholesome
food
as
eagerly
as
they
do
now
for
things
that
ruin
their
little
tummies
it
a
splendid
system
and
how
are
you
meeting
the
matinee
problem
asked
the
march
hare
illustration
when
they
think
nobody
looking
same
way
said
the
duchess
every
wednesday
and
saturday
afternoon
we
make
go
to
a
matinee
rain
or
shine
whether
they
want
to
or
not
and
really
it
pathetic
to
see
how
some
of
the
little
dears
pine
for
a
with
a
hoople
and
since
i
forbade
the
youngsters
to
even
look
at
the
back
of
a
geography
or
a
spelling
book
it
is
most
amusing
to
see
how
they
sneak
into
the
library
and
devour
the
contents
of
those
two
books
when
they
think
nobody
looking
i
caught
one
of
the
boys
reading
an
arithmetic
in
bed
last
night
wholly
neglecting
his
jack
harkaway
books
that
i
had
commanded
him
to
read
and
leaving
his
the
broncho
buster
of
buffalo
absolutely
uncut
fine
chuckled
the
hatter
and
now
my
dear
duchess
will
you
oblige
me
by
taking
charge
of
miss
alice
she
has
expressed
a
desire
to
go
home
and
so
i
have
brought
her
here
certainly
said
the
duchess
i
look
after
her
you
excuse
us
alice
said
the
hatter
politely
we
escort
you
further
ourselves
but
a
question
has
come
before
the
municipal
ownership
caucus
that
we
must
settle
before
the
meeting
of
the
common
council
certain
of
our
members
claim
that
they
have
a
right
to
sell
their
votes
for
apiece
mercy
cried
alice
why
that
is
that
is
terrible
it
certainly
is
said
the
march
hare
ruefully
it
more
than
terrible
it
rotten
here
i
been
holding
out
for
for
mine
and
these
duffers
want
to
go
in
for
a
cut
rate
that
will
absolutely
ruin
the
business
it
a
very
important
matter
said
the
hatter
after
all
our
striving
to
elevate
the
people
we
do
want
them
to
make
themselves
too
cheap
for
my
part
i
do
think
they
should
let
go
of
a
vote
on
any
question
for
less
than
that
all
right
mayor
said
the
white
knight
but
you
want
to
frighten
capital
you
know
well
you
and
i
disagree
on
that
point
said
the
mayor
capital
at
all
necessary
to
the
success
of
our
schemes
my
watchword
is
bonds
and
as
long
as
i
have
a
printing
press
to
print
and
a
fountain
pen
to
sign
i
not
going
to
be
influenced
one
way
or
another
by
a
feeling
of
subserviency
to
the
capitalist
class
good
night
miss
alice
glad
to
have
met
you
and
i
hope
you
will
have
a
pleasant
time
with
the
duchess
here
he
added
taking
a
beautifully
printed
green
and
gold
paper
from
his
pocket
here
is
a
blanket
mortgage
deferred
debenture
bond
on
the
main
street
ferry
of
a
par
value
of
payable
in
as
a
souvenir
of
your
visit
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
cried
alice
for
me
no
corrected
the
hatter
a
hundred
thousand
dollar
bond
you
get
the
money
until
and
not
then
unless
you
present
it
in
person
to
the
city
treasurer
with
which
munificent
gift
the
hatter
respectfully
bowed
himself
away
and
made
on
followed
by
the
march
hare
illustration
if
you
get
into
trouble
use
this
alice
said
the
white
knight
sympathetically
and
then
thrusting
a
paper
in
her
hand
he
leaned
forward
and
whispered
into
the
little
girl
ear
if
you
get
into
trouble
use
this
thank
you
said
alice
what
is
it
it
a
temporary
injunction
issued
by
the
chief
justice
restraining
anybody
from
interfering
with
you
said
the
white
knight
you
may
need
it
and
the
kindly
old
knight
ran
madly
off
up
the
street
after
the
mayor
and
the
march
hare
and
shortly
disappeared
around
the
corner
now
my
little
dear
said
the
duchess

alice
by
the
hand
the
duchess
led
the
little
traveller
into
the
municipal
nursery
entering
the
elevator
they
went
up
and
up
and
up
and
up
until
alice
thought
they
would
never
stop
finally
on
the
floor
the
elevator
stopped
alice
and
the
duchess
alighted
and
entered
a
funny
little
flat
singularly
enough
labelled
with
alice

name

the
duchess

the
duchess

laughed
the
duchess
well
i
just
wo
stay
that
all
cried
alice
stamping
her
foot
angrily
i
do
want
a
city
for
a

and
i
sha
have
an
official
mother
in
place
of
a
real
one
illustration
seizing
her
by
the
arm
the
child
ran
toward
the
door
but
the
duchess
was
too
quick
for
her
seizing
her
by
the
arm
let
me
go
shrieked
alice
never
snapped
the
duchess
and
then
the
little
girl
thought
of
the
piece
of
paper
the
white
knight
had
given
her
i
guess
that
will
make
you
change
your
mind
she
said
handing
the
injunction
to
her
captor
the
duchess
read
it
carefully
her
face
paled
and
she
too
stamped
her
foot
i
see
about
this
she
roared
angrily
and
in
a
moment
she
had
gone
slamming
the
door
so
hard
behind
her
that
the
building
fairly
shook
a
moment
later
alice
followed
and
in
a
short
time
was
bounding
down
the
stairway
as
fast
as
her
little
legs
would
carry
her
toward
freedom
when
all
of
a
sudden
she
tripped
and
began
to
fall
down
down
down
o
would
she
never
stop
and
then
bump
her
fall
was
over
and
strange
to
relate
the
little
maid
found
herself
sitting
on
the
floor
back
in
her
own
nursery
in
her
own
real
home
with
her
mother
bending
over
her
dear
me
alice
said
her
mother
i
hope
you
have
hurt
yourself

i
i

i
really

sofa
laughed
her
mother
where
have
you
been
she
added
in
wonderland
again
no
said
alice
in
blunderland
this
time
which
struck
her
father
when
he
heard
the
story
of
her
adventures
later
as
a
very
apt
and
descriptive
title
for
the
o
country
