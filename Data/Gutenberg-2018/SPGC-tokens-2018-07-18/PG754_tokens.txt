the

of

history
is
laid
upon

little
planet
lost

to
jimmie
what
is
the
use
of
a
book
without
pictures
said
alice
foreword
for
hansje
and
willem
when
i
was
twelve
or
thirteen
years
old
an
uncle
of
mine
who
gave
me
my
love
for
books
and
pictures
promised
to
take
me
upon
a
memorable
expedition
i
was
to
go
with
him
to
the
top
of
the
tower
of
old
saint
lawrence
in
rotterdam
and
so
one
fine
day
a
sexton
with
a
key
as
large
as
that
of
saint
peter
opened
a
mysterious
door
ring
the
bell
he
said
when
you
come
back
and
want
to
get
out
and
with
a
great
grinding
of
rusty
old
hinges
he
separated
us
from
the
noise
of
the
busy
street
and
locked
us
into
a
world
of
new
and
strange
experiences
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
was
confronted
by
the
phenomenon
of
audible
silence
when
we
had
climbed
the
first
flight
of
stairs
i
added
another
discovery
to
my
limited
knowledge
of
natural
phenomena
that
of
tangible
darkness
a
match
showed
us
where
the
upward
road
continued
we
went
to
the
next
floor
and
then
to
the
next
and
the
next
until
i
had
lost
count
and
then
there
came
still
another
floor
and
suddenly
we
had
plenty
of
light
this
floor
was
on
an
even
height
with
the
roof
of
the
church
and
it
was
used
as
a
storeroom
covered
with
many
inches
of
dust
there
lay
the
abandoned
symbols
of
a
venerable
faith
which
had
been
discarded
by
the
good
people
of
the
city
many
years
ago
that
which
had
meant
life
and
death
to
our
ancestors
was
here
reduced
to
junk
and
rubbish
the
industrious
rat
had
built
his
nest
among
the
carved
images
and
the
ever
watchful
spider
had
opened
up
shop
between
the
outspread
arms
of
a
kindly
saint
the
next
floor
showed
us
from
where
we
had
derived
our
light
enormous
open
windows
with
heavy
iron
bars
made
the
high
and
barren
room
the
roosting
place
of
hundreds
of
pigeons
the
wind
blew
through
the
iron
bars
and
the
air
was
filled
with
a
weird
and
pleasing
music
it
was
the
noise
of
the
town
below
us
but
a
noise
which
had
been
purified
and
cleansed
by
the
distance
the
rumbling
of
heavy
carts
and
the
clinking
of
horses
hoofs
the
winding
of
cranes
and
pulleys
the
hissing
sound
of
the
patient
steam
which
had
been
set
to
do
the
work
of
man
in
a
thousand
different
ways
they
had
all
been
blended
into
a
softly
rustling
whisper
which
provided
a
beautiful
background
for
the
trembling
cooing
of
the
pigeons
here
the
stairs
came
to
an
end
and
the
ladders
began
and
after
the
first
ladder
a
slippery
old
thing
which
made
one
feel
his
way
with
a
cautious
foot
there
was
a
new
and
even
greater
wonder
the
i
saw
the
heart
of
time
i
could
hear
the
heavy
pulsebeats
of
the
rapid
seconds
one
two
three
up
to
sixty
then
a
sudden
quivering
noise
when
all
the
wheels
seemed
to
stop
and
another
minute
had
been
chopped
off
eternity
without
pause
it
began
again
one
two
three
until
at
last
after
a
warning
rumble
and
the
scraping
of
many
wheels
a
thunderous
voice
high
above
us
told
the
world
that
it
was
the
hour
of
noon
on
the
next
floor
were
the
bells
the
nice
little
bells
and
their
terrible
sisters
in
the
centre
the
big
bell
which
made
me
turn
stiff
with
fright
when
i
heard
it
in
the
middle
of
the
night
telling
a
story
of
fire
or
flood
in
solitary
grandeur
it
seemed
to
reflect
upon
those
six
hundred
years
during
which
it
had
shared
the
joys
and
the
sorrows
of
the
good
people
of
rotterdam
around
it
neatly
arranged
like
the
blue
jars
in
an
apothecary
shop
hung
the
little
fellows
who
twice
each
week
played
a
merry
tune
for
the
benefit
of
the
who
had
come
to
market
to
buy
and
sell
and
hear
what
the
big
world
had
been
doing
but
in
a
corner
all
alone
and
shunned
by
the
others
a
big
black
bell
silent
and
stern
the
bell
of
death
then
darkness
once
more
and
other
ladders
steeper
and
even
more
dangerous
than
those
we
had
climbed
before
and
suddenly
the
fresh
air
of
the
wide
heavens
we
had
reached
the
highest
gallery
above
us
the
sky
below
us
the
city
a
little
where
busy
ants
were
hastily
crawling
hither
and
thither
each
one
intent
upon
his
or
her
particular
business
and
beyond
the
jumble
of
stones
the
wide
greenness
of
the
open
country
it
was
my
first
glimpse
of
the
big
world
since
then
whenever
i
have
had
the
opportunity
i
have
gone
to
the
top
of
the
tower
and
enjoyed
myself
it
was
hard
work
but
it
repaid
in
full
the
mere
physical
exertion
of
climbing
a
few
stairs
besides
i
knew
what
my
reward
would
be
i
would
see
the
land
and
the
sky
and
i
would
listen
to
the
stories
of
my
kind
friend
the
watchman
who
lived
in
a
small
shack
built
in
a
sheltered
corner
of
the
gallery
he
looked
after
the
clock
and
was
a
father
to
the
bells
and
he
warned
of
fires
but
he
enjoyed
many
free
hours
and
then
he
smoked
a
pipe
and
thought
his
own
peaceful
thoughts
he
had
gone
to
school
almost
fifty
years
before
and
he
had
rarely
read
a
book
but
he
had
lived
on
the
top
of
his
tower
for
so
many
years
that
he
had
absorbed
the
wisdom
of
that
wide
world
which
surrounded
him
on
all
sides
history
he
knew
well
for
it
was
a
living
thing
with
him
there
he
would
say
pointing
to
a
bend
of
the
river
there
my
boy
do
you
see
those
trees
that
is
where
the
prince
of
orange
cut
the
dikes
to
drown
the
land
and
save
leyden
or
he
would
tell
me
the
tale
of
the
old
meuse
until
the
broad
river
ceased
to
be
a
convenient
harbour
and
became
a
wonderful
highroad
carrying
the
ships
of
de
ruyter
and
tromp
upon
that
famous
last
voyage
when
they
gave
their
lives
that
the
sea
might
be
free
to
all
then
there
were
the
little
villages
clustering
around
the
protecting
church
which
once
many
years
ago
had
been
the
home
of
their
patron
saints
in
the
distance
we
could
see
the
leaning
tower
of
delft
within
sight
of
its
high
arches
william
the
silent
had
been
murdered
and
there
grotius
had
learned
to
construe
his
first
latin
sentences
and
still
further
away
the
long
low
body
of
the
church
of
gouda
the
early
home
of
the
man
whose
wit
had
proved
mightier
than
the
armies
of
many
an
emperor
the
whom
the
world
came
to
know
as
erasmus
finally
the
silver
line
of
the
endless
sea
and
as
a
contrast
immediately
below
us
the
patchwork
of
roofs
and
chimneys
and
houses
and
gardens
and
hospitals
and
schools
and
railways
which
we
called
our
home
but
the
tower
showed
us
the
old
home
in
a
new
light
the
confused
commotion
of
the
streets
and
the
of
the
factories
and
the
workshop
became
the
expression
of
human
energy
and
purpose
best
of
all
the
wide
view
of
the
glorious
past
which
surrounded
us
on
all
sides
gave
us
new
courage
to
face
the
problems
of
the
future
when
we
had
gone
back
to
our
daily
tasks
history
is
the
mighty
tower
of
experience
which
time
has
built
amidst
the
endless
fields
of
bygone
ages
it
is
no
easy
task
to
reach
the
top
of
this
ancient
structure
and
get
the
benefit
of
the
full
view
there
is
no
elevator
but
young
feet
are
strong
and
it
can
be
done
here
i
give
you
the
key
that
will
open
the
door
when
you
return
you
too
will
understand
the
reason
for

how

it

all

were

more
agreeable
civilisation

and
they
were
proud
of
their
achievements
that
they
spoke

of

began
to
feel

now
that

broken
through

medieval
limitations
they
had
to

forever
swings
forward

the
religious

of

followed
by
the
artistic

literary
indifference
and
the

age

religious
controversies
how
the
struggle

the
divine
right
of
kings
and
the
less
divine
but
more
reasonable
right
of
parliament
ended
disastrously
for

charles
ii
in
france
on
the
other
hand
the
divine
right
of
kings
continued
with
greater
pomp
and
splendor
than
ever
before
and
the
ambition
of
the
ruler
was
only
tempered
by
the
newly
invented
law
of
the
balance
of
power
the
story
of
the
mysterious
muscovite
empire
which
suddenly
burst
upon
the
grand
political
stage
of
europe
russia
and
sweden
fought

wars

an

peace

suppressing

ideas
they
made

highest
functionary
in

the
prisons
of

countries
were
filled

who
claimed

have

right
to
govern
themselves

they
see
fit

love

national
independence
however
was
too
strong
to
be
destroyed
in
this
way
the
south
americans
were
the
first
to
rebel
against
the
reactionary
measures
of
the
congress
of
vienna
greece
and
belgium
and
spain
and
a
large
number
of
other
countries
of
the
european
continent
followed
suit
and
the
nineteenth
century
was
filled
with
the
rumor
of
many
wars
of
independence
but
white
the
people
of
europe
were
fighting
for
their
national
independence
the
world
in
which
they
lived
had
been
entirely
changed
by
a
series
of
inventions
which
had
made
the
clumsy
old
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
most
faithful
and
efficient
stave
of
man
the
new
engines
were
very
expensive
and
only
people
of
wealth
could
afford
them
the
old
carpenter
or
shoemaker
who
had
been
his
own
master
in
his
little
workshop
was
obliged
to
hire
himself
out
to
the
owners
of
the
big
mechanical
tools
and
white
he
made
more
money
than
before
he
lost
his
former
independence
and
he
did
not
like
that
the
general
introduction
of
machinery
did
not
bring
about
the
era
of
happiness
and
prosperity
which
had
been
predicted
by
the
generation
which
saw
the
stage
coach
replaced
by
the
railroad
several
remedies
were
suggested
but
none
of
these
quite
solved
the
problem
but
the
world
had
undergone
another
change
which
was
of
greater
importance
than
either
the
political
or
the
industrial
revolutions
after
generations
of
oppression
and
persecution
the
scientist
had
at
last
gained
liberty
of
action
and
he
was
now
trying
to
discover
the
fundamental
laws
which
govern
the
universe
a
chapter
of
art
the
last
fifty
years
including
several
explanations
and
a
few
apologies
the
great
war
which
was
really
the
struggle
for
a
new
and

the
story
of
mankind
high
up
in
the
north
in
the
land
called
svithjod
there
stands
a
rock
it
is
a
hundred
miles
high
and
a
hundred
miles
wide
once
every
thousand
years
a
little
bird
comes
to
this
rock
to
sharpen
its
beak
when
the
rock
has
thus
been
worn
away
then
a
single
day
of
eternity
will
have
gone
by
the
setting
of
the
stage
we
live
under
the
shadow
of
a
gigantic
question
mark
who
are
we
where
do
we
come
from
whither
are
we
bound
slowly
but
with
persistent
courage
we
have
been
pushing
this
question
mark
further
and
further
towards
that
distant
line
beyond
the
horizon
where
we
hope
to
find
our
answer
we
have
not
gone
very
far
we
still
know
very
little
but
we
have
reached
the
point
where
with
a
fair
degree
of
accuracy
we
can
guess
at
many
things
in
this
chapter
i
shall
tell
you
how
according
to
our
best
belief
the
stage
was
set
for
the
first
appearance
of
man
if
we
represent
the
time
during
which
it
has
been
possible
for
animal
life
to
exist
upon
our
planet
by
a
line
of
this
length
then
the
tiny
line
just
below
indicates
the
age
during
which
man
or
a
creature
more
or
less
resembling
man
has
lived
upon
this
earth
man
was
the
last
to
come
but
the
first
to
use
his
brain
for
the
purpose
of
conquering
the
forces
of
nature
that
is
the
reason
why
we
are
going
to
study
him
rather
than
cats
or
dogs
or
horses
or
any
of
the
other
animals
who
all
in
their
own
way
have
a
very
interesting
historical
development
behind
them
in
the
beginning
the
planet
upon
which
we
live
was
as
far
as
we
now
know
a
large
ball
of
flaming
matter
a
tiny
cloud
of
smoke
in
the
endless
ocean
of
space
gradually
in
the
course
of
millions
of
years
the
surface
burned
itself
out
and
was
covered
with
a
thin
layer
of
rocks
upon
these
lifeless
rocks
the
rain
descended
in
endless
torrents
wearing
out
the
hard
granite
and
carrying
the
dust
to
the
valleys
that
lay
hidden
between
the
high
cliffs
of
the
steaming
earth
finally
the
hour
came
when
the
sun
broke
through
the
clouds
and
saw
how
this
little
planet
was
covered
with
a
few
small
puddles
which
were
to
develop
into
the
mighty
oceans
of
the
eastern
and
western
hemispheres
then
one
day
the
great
wonder
happened
what
had
been
dead
gave
birth
to
life
the
first
living
cell
floated
upon
the
waters
of
the
sea
for
millions
of
years
it
drifted
aimlessly
with
the
currents
but
during
all
that
time
it
was
developing
certain
habits
that
it
might
survive
more
easily
upon
the
inhospitable
earth
some
of
these
cells
were
happiest
in
the
dark
depths
of
the
lakes
and
the
pools
they
took
root
in
the
slimy
sediments
which
had
been
carried
down
from
the
tops
of
the
hills
and
they
became
plants
others
preferred
to
move
about
and
they
grew
strange
jointed
legs
like
scorpions
and
began
to
crawl
along
the
bottom
of
the
sea
amidst
the
plants
and
the
pale
green
things
that
looked
like
still
others
covered
with
scales
depended
upon
a
swimming
motion
to
go
from
place
to
place
in
their
search
for
food
and
gradually
they
populated
the
ocean
with
myriads
of
fishes
meanwhile
the
plants
had
increased
in
number
and
they
had
to
search
for
new
dwelling
places
there
was
no
more
room
for
them
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
reluctantly
they
left
the
water
and
made
a
new
home
in
the
marshes
and
on
the
that
lay
at
the
foot
of
the
mountains
twice
a
day
the
tides
of
the
ocean
covered
them
with
their
brine
for
the
rest
of
the
time
the
plants
made
the
best
of
their
uncomfortable
situation
and
tried
to
survive
in
the
thin
air
which
surrounded
the
surface
of
the
planet
after
centuries
of
training
they
learned
how
to
live
as
comfortably
in
the
air
as
they
had
done
in
the
water
they
increased
in
size
and
became
shrubs
and
trees
and
at
last
they
learned
how
to
grow
lovely
flowers
which
attracted
the
attention
of
the
busy
big
and
the
birds
who
carried
the
seeds
far
and
wide
until
the
whole
earth
had
become
covered
with
green
pastures
or
lay
dark
under
the
shadow
of
the
big
trees
but
some
of
the
fishes
too
had
begun
to
leave
the
sea
and
they
had
learned
how
to
breathe
with
lungs
as
well
as
with
gills
we
call
such
creatures
amphibious
which
means
that
they
are
able
to
live
with
equal
ease
on
the
land
and
in
the
water
the
first
frog
who
crosses
your
path
can
tell
you
all
about
the
pleasures
of
the
double
existence
of
the
amphibian
once
outside
of
the
water
these
animals
gradually
adapted
themselves
more
and
more
to
life
on
land
some
became
reptiles
creatures
who
crawl
like
lizards
and
they
shared
the
silence
of
the
forests
with
the
insects
that
they
might
move
faster
through
the
soft
soil
they
improved
upon
their
legs
and
their
size
increased
until
the
world
was
populated
with
gigantic
forms
which
the
of
biology
list
under
the
names
of
ichthyosaurus
and
megalosaurus
and
brontosaurus
who
grew
to
be
thirty
to
forty
feet
long
and
who
could
have
played
with
elephants
as
a
full
grown
cat
plays
with
her
kittens
some
of
the
members
of
this
reptilian
family
began
to
live
in
the
tops
of
the
trees
which
were
then
often
more
than
a
hundred
feet
high
they
no
longer
needed
their
legs
for
the
purpose
of
walking
but
it
was
necessary
for
them
to
move
quickly
from
branch
to
branch
and
so
they
changed
a
part
of
their
skin
into
a
sort
of
parachute
which
stretched
between
the
sides
of
their
bodies
and
the
small
toes
of
their
and
gradually
they
covered
this
skinny
parachute
with
feathers
and
made
their
tails
into
a
steering
gear
and
flew
from
tree
to
tree
and
developed
into
true
birds
then
a
strange
thing
happened
all
the
gigantic
reptiles
died
within
a
short
time
we
do
not
know
the
reason
perhaps
it
was
due
to
a
sudden
change
in
climate
perhaps
they
had
grown
so
large
that
they
could
neither
swim
nor
walk
nor
crawl
and
they
starved
to
death
within
sight
but
not
within
reach
of
the
big
ferns
and
trees
whatever
the
cause
the
million
year
old
of
the
big
reptiles
was
over
the
world
now
began
to
be
occupied
by
very
different
creatures
they
were
the
descendants
of
the
reptiles
but
they
were
quite
unlike
these
because
they
fed
their
young
from
the
mammae
or
the
breasts
of
the
mother
wherefore
modern
science
calls
these
animals
mammals
they
had
shed
the
scales
of
the
fish
they
did
not
adopt
the
feathers
of
the
bird
but
they
covered
their
bodies
with
hair
the
mammals
however
developed
other
habits
which
gave
their
race
a
great
advantage
over
the
other
animals
the
female
of
the
species
carried
the
eggs
of
the
young
inside
her
body
until
they
were
hatched
and
while
all
other
living
beings
up
to
that
time
had
left
their
children
exposed
to
the
dangers
of
cold
and
heat
and
the
attacks
of
wild
beasts
the
mammals
kept
their
young
with
them
for
a
long
time
and
sheltered
them
while
they
were
still
too
weak
to
fight
their
enemies
in
this
way
the
young
mammals
were
given
a
much
better
chance
to
survive
because
they
learned
many
things
from
their
mothers
as
you
will
know
if
you
have
ever
watched
a
cat
teaching
her
kittens
to
take
care
of
themselves
and
how
to
wash
their
faces
and
how
to
catch
mice
but
of
these
mammals
i
need
not
tell
you
much
for
you
know
them
well
they
surround
you
on
all
sides
they
are
your
daily
companions
in
the
streets
and
in
your
home
and
you
can
see
your
less
familiar
cousins
behind
the
bars
of
the
zoological
garden
and
now
we
come
to
the
parting
of
the
ways
when
man
suddenly
leaves
the
endless
procession
of
dumbly
living
and
dying
creatures
and
begins
to
use
his
reason
to
shape
the
destiny
of
his
race
one
mammal
in
particular
seemed
to
surpass
all
others
in
its
ability
to
find
food
and
shelter
it
had
learned
to
use
its
for
the
purpose
of
holding
its
prey
and
by
dint
of
practice
it
had
developed
a
claw
after
innumerable
attempts
it
had
learned
how
to
balance
the
whole
of
the
body
upon
the
hind
legs
this
is
a
difficult
act
which
every
child
has
to
learn
anew
although
the
human
race
has
been
doing
it
for
over
a
million
years
this
creature
half
ape
and
half
monkey
but
superior
to
both
became
the
most
successful
hunter
and
could
make
a
living
in
every
clime
for
greater
safety
it
usually
moved
about
in
groups
it
learned
how
to
make
strange
grunts
to
warn
its
young
of
approaching
danger
and
after
many
hundreds
of
thousands
of
years
it
began
to
use
these
throaty
noises
for
the
purpose
of
talking
this
creature
though
you
may
hardly
believe
it
was
your
first
ancestor
our
earliest
ancestors
we
know
very
little
about
the
first
true
men
we
have
never
seen
their
pictures
in
the
deepest
layer
of
clay
of
an
ancient
soil
we
have
sometimes
found
pieces
of
their
bones
these
lay
buried
amidst
the
broken
skeletons
of
other
animals
that
have
long
since
disappeared
from
the
face
of
the
earth
anthropologists
learned
scientists
who
devote
their
lives
to
the
study
of
man
as
a
member
of
the
animal
kingdom
have
taken
these
bones
and
they
have
been
able
to
reconstruct
our
earliest
ancestors
with
a
fair
degree
of
accuracy
the
of
the
human
race
was
a
very
ugly
and
unattractive
mammal
he
was
quite
small
much
smaller
than
the
people
of
today
the
heat
of
the
sun
and
the
biting
wind
of
the
cold
winter
had
coloured
his
skin
a
dark
brown
his
head
and
most
of
his
body
his
arms
and
legs
too
were
covered
with
long
coarse
hair
he
had
very
thin
but
strong
fingers
which
made
his
hands
look
like
those
of
a
monkey
his
forehead
was
low
and
his
jaw
was
like
the
jaw
of
a
wild
animal
which
uses
its
teeth
both
as
fork
and
knife
he
wore
no
clothes
he
had
seen
no
fire
except
the
flames
of
the
rumbling
volcanoes
which
filled
the
earth
with
their
smoke
and
their
lava
he
lived
in
the
damp
blackness
of
vast
forests
as
the
pygmies
of
africa
do
to
this
very
day
when
he
felt
the
pangs
of
hunger
he
ate
raw
leaves
and
the
roots
of
plants
or
he
took
the
eggs
away
from
an
angry
bird
and
fed
them
to
his
own
young
once
in
a
while
after
a
long
and
patient
chase
he
would
catch
a
sparrow
or
a
small
wild
dog
or
perhaps
a
rabbit
these
he
would
eat
raw
for
he
had
never
discovered
that
food
tasted
better
when
it
was
cooked
during
the
hours
of
day
this
primitive
human
being
prowled
about
looking
for
things
to
eat
when
night
descended
upon
the
earth
he
hid
his
wife
and
his
children
in
a
hollow
tree
or
behind
some
heavy
boulders
for
he
was
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
ferocious
animals
and
when
it
was
dark
these
animals
began
to
prowl
about
looking
for
something
to
eat
for
their
mates
and
their
own
young
and
they
liked
the
taste
of
human
beings
it
was
a
world
where
you
must
either
eat
or
be
eaten
and
life
was
very
unhappy
because
it
was
full
of
fear
and
misery
in
summer
man
was
exposed
to
the
scorching
rays
of
the
sun
and
during
the
winter
his
children
would
freeze
to
death
in
his
arms
when
such
a
creature
hurt
itself
and
hunting
animals
are
forever
breaking
their
bones
or
spraining
their
ankles
he
had
no
one
to
take
care
of
him
and
he
must
die
a
horrible
death
like
many
of
the
animals
who
fill
the
zoo
with
their
strange
noises
early
man
liked
to
jabber
that
is
to
say
he
endlessly
repeated
the
same
unintelligible
gibberish
because
it
pleased
him
to
hear
the
sound
of
his
voice
in
due
time
he
learned
that
he
could
use
this
guttural
noise
to
warn
his
fellow
beings
whenever
danger
threatened
and
he
gave
certain
little
shrieks
which
came
to
mean
there
is
a
tiger
or
here
come
five
elephants
then
the
others
grunted
something
back
at
him
and
their
growl
meant
i
see
them
or
let
us
run
away
and
hide
and
this
was
probably
the
origin
of
all
language
but
as
i
have
said
before
of
these
beginnings
we
know
so
very
little
early
man
had
no
tools
and
he
built
himself
no
houses
he
lived
and
died
and
left
no
trace
of
his
existence
except
a
few
and
a
few
pieces
of
his
skull
these
tell
us
that
many
thousands
of
years
ago
the
world
was
inhabited
by
certain
mammals
who
were
quite
different
from
all
the
other
animals
who
had
probably
developed
from
another
unknown
animal
which
had
learned
to
walk
on
its
and
use
its
as
hands
and
who
were
most
probably
connected
with
the
creatures
who
happen
to
be
our
own
immediate
ancestors
it
is
little
enough
we
know
and
the
rest
is
darkness
prehistoric
man
prehistoric
man
begins
to
make
things
for
himself
early
man
did
not
know
what
time
meant
he
kept
no
records
of
birthdays
or
wedding
anniversaries
or
the
hour
of
death
he
had
no
idea
of
days
or
weeks
or
even
years
but
in
a
general
way
he
kept
track
of
the
seasons
for
he
had
noticed
that
the
cold
winter
was
invariably
followed
by
the
mild
spring
that
spring
grew
into
the
hot
summer
when
fruits
ripened
and
the
wild
ears
of
corn
were
ready
to
be
eaten
and
that
summer
ended
when
sudden
gusts
of
wind
swept
the
leaves
from
the
trees
and
a
number
of
animals
were
getting
ready
for
the
long
hibernal
sleep
but
now
something
unusual
and
rather
frightening
had
happened
something
was
the
matter
with
the
weather
the
warm
days
of
summer
had
come
very
late
the
fruits
had
not
ripened
the
tops
of
the
mountains
which
used
to
be
covered
with
grass
now
lay
deeply
hidden
underneath
a
heavy
burden
of
snow
then
one
morning
a
number
of
wild
people
different
from
the
other
creatures
who
lived
in
that
neighbourhood
came
wandering
down
from
the
region
of
the
high
peaks
they
looked
lean
and
appeared
to
be
starving
they
uttered
sounds
which
no
one
could
understand
they
seemed
to
say
that
they
were
hungry
there
was
not
food
enough
for
both
the
old
inhabitants
and
the
newcomers
when
they
tried
to
stay
more
than
a
few
days
there
was
a
terrible
battle
with
hands
and
feet
and
whole
families
were
killed
the
others
fled
back
to
their
mountain
slopes
and
died
in
the
next
blizzard
but
the
people
in
the
forest
were
greatly
frightened
all
the
time
the
days
grew
shorter
and
the
nights
grew
colder
than
they
ought
to
have
been
finally
in
a
gap
between
two
high
hills
there
appeared
a
tiny
speck
of
greenish
ice
rapidly
it
increased
in
size
a
gigantic
glacier
came
sliding
downhill
huge
stones
were
being
pushed
into
the
valley
with
the
noise
of
a
dozen
thunderstorms
torrents
of
ice
and
mud
and
blocks
of
granite
suddenly
tumbled
among
the
people
of
the
forest
and
killed
them
while
they
slept
century
old
trees
were
crushed
into
kindling
wood
and
then
it
began
to
snow
it
snowed
for
months
and
months
all
the
plants
died
and
the
animals
fled
in
search
of
the
southern
sun
man
hoisted
his
young
upon
his
back
and
followed
them
but
he
could
not
travel
as
fast
as
the
wilder
creatures
and
he
was
forced
to
choose
between
quick
thinking
or
quick
dying
he
seems
to
have
preferred
the
former
for
he
has
managed
to
survive
the
terrible
glacial
periods
which
upon
four
different
occasions
threatened
to
kill
every
human
being
on
the
face
of
the
earth
in
the
first
place
it
was
necessary
that
man
clothe
himself
lest
he
freeze
to
death
he
learned
how
to
dig
holes
and
cover
them
with
branches
and
leaves
and
in
these
traps
he
caught
bears
and
hyenas
which
he
then
killed
with
heavy
stones
and
whose
skins
he
used
as
coats
for
himself
and
his
family
next
came
the
housing
problem
this
was
simple
many
animals
were
in
the
habit
of
sleeping
in
dark
caves
man
now
followed
their
example
drove
the
animals
out
of
their
warm
homes
and
claimed
them
for
his
own
even
so
the
climate
was
too
severe
for
most
people
and
the
old
and
the
young
died
at
a
terrible
rate
then
a
genius
bethought
himself
of
the
use
of
fire
once
while
out
hunting
he
had
been
caught
in
a
he
remembered
that
he
had
been
almost
roasted
to
death
by
the
flames
thus
far
fire
had
been
an
enemy
now
it
became
a
friend
a
dead
tree
was
dragged
into
the
cave
and
lighted
by
means
of
smouldering
branches
from
a
burning
wood
this
turned
the
cave
into
a
cozy
little
room
and
then
one
evening
a
dead
chicken
fell
into
the
fire
it
was
not
rescued
until
it
had
been
well
roasted
man
discovered
that
meat
tasted
better
when
cooked
and
he
then
and
there
discarded
one
of
the
old
habits
which
he
had
shared
with
the
other
animals
and
began
to
prepare
his
food
in
this
way
thousands
of
years
passed
only
the
people
with
the
cleverest
brains
survived
they
had
to
struggle
day
and
night
against
cold
and
hunger
they
were
forced
to
invent
tools
they
learned
how
to
sharpen
stones
into
axes
and
how
to
make
hammers
they
were
obliged
to
put
up
large
stores
of
food
for
the
endless
days
of
the
winter
and
they
found
that
clay
could
be
made
into
bowls
and
jars
and
hardened
in
the
rays
of
the
sun
and
so
the
glacial
period
which
had
threatened
to
destroy
the
human
race
became
its
greatest
teacher
because
it
forced
man
to
use
his
brain
hieroglyphics
the
egyptians
invent
the
art
of
writing
and
the
record
of
history
begins
these
earliest
ancestors
of
ours
who
lived
in
the
great
european
wilderness
were
rapidly
learning
many
new
things
it
is
safe
to
say
that
in
due
course
of
time
they
would
have
given
up
the
ways
of
savages
and
would
have
developed
a
civilisation
of
their
own
but
suddenly
there
came
an
end
to
their
isolation
they
were
discovered
a
traveller
from
an
unknown
southland
who
had
dared
to
cross
the
sea
and
the
high
mountain
passes
had
found
his
way
to
the
wild
people
of
the
european
continent
he
came
from
africa
his
home
was
in
egypt
the
valley
of
the
nile
had
developed
a
high
stage
of
civilisation
thousands
of
years
before
the
people
of
the
west
had
dreamed
of
the
possibilities
of
a
fork
or
a
wheel
or
a
house
and
we
shall
therefore
leave
our
in
their
caves
while
we
visit
the
southern
and
eastern
shores
of
the
mediterranean
where
stood
the
earliest
school
of
the
human
race
the
egyptians
have
taught
us
many
things
they
were
excellent
farmers
they
knew
all
about
irrigation
they
built
temples
which
were
afterwards
copied
by
the
greeks
and
which
served
as
the
earliest
models
for
the
churches
in
which
we
worship
nowadays
they
had
invented
a
calendar
which
proved
such
a
useful
instrument
for
the
purpose
of
measuring
time
that
it
has
survived
with
a
few
changes
until
today
but
most
important
of
all
the
egyptians
had
learned
how
to
preserve
speech
for
the
benefit
of
future
generations
they
had
invented
the
art
of
writing
we
are
so
accustomed
to
newspapers
and
books
and
magazines
that
we
take
it
for
granted
that
the
world
has
always
been
able
to
read
and
write
as
a
matter
of
fact
writing
the
most
important
of
all
inventions
is
quite
new
without
written
documents
we
would
be
like
cats
and
dogs
who
can
only
teach
their
kittens
and
their
puppies
a
few
simple
things
and
who
because
they
can
not
write
possess
no
way
in
which
they
can
make
use
of
the
experience
of
those
generations
of
cats
and
dogs
that
have
gone
before
in
the
first
century
before
our
era
when
the
romans
came
to
egypt
they
found
the
valley
full
of
strange
little
pictures
which
seemed
to
have
something
to
do
with
the
history
of
the
country
but
the
romans
were
not
interested
in
anything
foreign
and
did
not
inquire
into
the
origin
of
these
queer
figures
which
covered
the
walls
of
the
temples
and
the
walls
of
the
palaces
and
endless
reams
of
flat
sheets
made
out
of
the
papyrus
reed
the
last
of
the
egyptian
priests
who
had
understood
the
holy
art
of
making
such
pictures
had
died
several
years
before
egypt
deprived
of
its
independence
had
become
a
filled
with
important
historical
documents
which
no
one
could
decipher
and
which
were
of
no
earthly
use
to
either
man
or
beast
seventeen
centuries
went
by
and
egypt
remained
a
land
of
mystery
but
in
the
year
a
french
general
by
the
name
of
bonaparte
happened
to
visit
eastern
africa
to
prepare
for
an
attack
upon
the
british
indian
colonies
he
did
not
get
beyond
the
nile
and
his
campaign
was
a
failure
but
quite
accidentally
the
famous
french
expedition
solved
the
problem
of
the
ancient
egyptian
one
day
a
young
french
officer
much
bored
by
the
dreary
life
of
his
little
fortress
on
the
rosetta
river
a
mouth
of
the
nile
decided
to
spend
a
few
idle
hours
rummaging
among
the
ruins
of
the
nile
delta
and
behold
he
found
a
stone
which
greatly
puzzled
him
like
everything
else
in
egypt
it
was
covered
with
little
figures
but
this
particular
slab
of
black
basalt
was
different
from
anything
that
had
ever
been
discovered
it
carried
three
inscriptions
one
of
these
was
in
greek
the
greek
language
was
known
all
that
is
necessary
so
he
reasoned
is
to
compare
the
greek
text
with
the
egyptian
figures
and
they
will
at
once
tell
their
secrets
the
plan
sounded
simple
enough
but
it
took
more
than
twenty
years
to
solve
the
riddle
in
the
year
a
french
professor
by
the
name
of
champollion
began
to
compare
the
greek
and
the
egyptian
texts
of
the
famous
rosetta
stone
in
the
year
he
announced
that
he
had
discovered
the
meaning
of
fourteen
little
figures
a
short
time
later
he
died
from
overwork
but
the
main
principles
of
egyptian
writing
had
become
known
today
the
story
of
the
valley
of
the
nile
is
better
known
to
us
than
the
story
of
the
mississippi
river
we
possess
a
written
record
which
covers
four
thousand
years
of
chronicled
history
as
the
ancient
egyptian
hieroglyphics
the
word
means
sacred
writing
have
played
such
a
very
great
role
in
history
a
few
of
them
in
modified
form
have
even
found
their
way
into
our
own
alphabet
you
ought
to
know
something
about
the
ingenious
system
which
was
used
fifty
centuries
ago
to
preserve
the
spoken
word
for
the
benefit
of
the
coming
generations
of
course
you
know
what
a
sign
language
is
every
indian
story
of
our
western
plains
has
a
chapter
devoted
to
strange
messages
writter
sic
in
the
form
of
little
pictures
which
tell
how
many
buffaloes
were
killed
and
how
many
hunters
there
were
in
a
certain
party
as
a
rule
it
is
not
difficult
to
understand
the
meaning
of
such
messages
ancient
egyptian
however
was
not
a
sign
language
the
clever
people
of
the
nile
had
passed
beyond
that
stage
long
before
their
pictures
meant
a
great
deal
more
than
the
object
which
they
represented
as
i
shall
try
to
explain
to
you
now
suppose
that
you
were
champollion
and
that
you
were
examining
a
stack
of
papyrus
sheets
all
covered
with
hieroglyphics
suddenly
you
came
across
a
picture
of
a
man
with
a
saw
very
well
you
would
say
that
means
of
course
that
a
farmer
went
out
to
cut
down
a
tree
then
you
take
another
papyrus
it
tells
the
story
of
a
queen
who
had
died
at
the
age
of
in
the
midst
of
a
sentence
appears
the
picture
of
the
man
with
the
saw
queens
of
do
not
handle
saws
the
picture
therefore
must
mean
something
else
but
what
that
is
the
riddle
which
the
frenchman
finally
solved
he
discovered
that
the
egyptians
were
the
first
to
use
what
we
now
call
phonetic
writing
a
system
of
characters
which
reproduce
the
sound
or
phone
of
the
spoken
word
and
which
make
it
possible
for
us
to
translate
all
our
spoken
words
into
a
written
form
with
the
help
of
only
a
few
dots
and
dashes
and
pothooks
let
us
return
for
a
moment
to
the
little
fellow
with
the
saw
the
word
saw
either
means
a
certain
tool
which
you
will
find
in
a
shop
or
it
means
the
past
tense
of
the
verb
to
see
this
is
what
had
happened
to
the
word
during
the
course
of
centuries
first
of
all
it
had
meant
only
the
particular
tool
which
it
represented
then
that
meaning
had
been
lost
and
it
had
become
the
past
participle
of
a
verb
after
several
hundred
years
the
egyptians
lost
sight
of
both
these
meanings
and
the
picture
illust
came
to
stand
for
a
single
letter
the
letter
a
short
sentence
will
show
you
what
i
mean
here
is
a
modern
english
sentence
as
it
would
have
been
written
in
hieroglyphics
illust
the
illust
either
means
one
of
these
two
round
objects
in
your
head
which
allow
you
to
see
or
it
means
i
the
person
who
is
talking
a
illust
is
either
an
insect
which
gathers
honey
or
it
represents
the
verb
to
be
which
means
to
exist
again
it
may
be
the
first
part
of
a
verb
like
or
in
this
particular
instance
it
is
followed
by
illust
which
means
a
leaf
or
leave
or
lieve
the
sound
of
all
three
words
is
the
same
the
eye
you
know
all
about
finally
you
get
the
picture
of
a
it
is
a
giraffe
it
is
part
of
the
old
out
of
which
the
hieroglyphics
developed
you
can
now
read
that
sentence
without
much
difficulty
i
believe
i
saw
a
giraffe
having
invented
this
system
the
egyptians
developed
it
during
thousands
of
years
until
they
could
write
anything
they
wanted
and
they
used
these
canned
words
to
send
messages
to
friends
to
keep
business
accounts
and
to
keep
a
record
of
the
history
of
their
country
that
future
generations
might
benefit
by
the
mistakes
of
the
past
the
nile
valley
the
beginning
of
civilisation
in
the
valley
of
the
nile
the
history
of
man
is
the
record
of
a
hungry
creature
in
search
of
food
wherever
food
was
plentiful
thither
man
has
travelled
to
make
his
home
the
fame
of
the
valley
of
the
nile
must
have
spread
at
an
early
date
from
the
interior
of
africa
and
from
the
desert
of
arabia
and
from
the
western
part
of
asia
people
had
flocked
to
egypt
to
claim
their
share
of
the
rich
farms
together
these
invaders
had
formed
a
new
race
which
called
itself
remi
or
the
men
just
as
we
sometimes
call
america
god
own
country
they
had
good
reason
to
be
grateful
to
a
fate
which
had
carried
them
to
this
narrow
strip
of
land
in
the
summer
of
each
year
the
nile
turned
the
valley
into
a
shallow
lake
and
when
the
waters
receded
all
the
grainfields
and
the
pastures
were
covered
with
several
inches
of
the
most
fertile
clay
in
egypt
a
kindly
river
did
the
work
of
a
million
men
and
made
it
possible
to
feed
the
teeming
population
of
the
first
large
cities
of
which
we
have
any
record
it
is
true
that
all
the
arable
land
was
not
in
the
valley
but
a
complicated
system
of
small
canals
and
carried
water
from
the
to
the
top
of
the
highest
banks
and
an
even
more
intricate
system
of
irrigation
trenches
spread
it
throughout
the
land
while
man
of
the
prehistoric
age
had
been
obliged
to
spend
sixteen
hours
out
of
every
gathering
food
for
himself
and
the
members
of
his
tribe
the
egyptian
peasant
or
the
inhabitant
of
the
egyptian
city
found
himself
possessed
of
a
certain
leisure
he
used
this
spare
time
to
make
himself
many
things
that
were
merely
ornamental
and
not
in
the
least
bit
useful
more
than
that
one
day
he
discovered
that
his
brain
was
capable
of
thinking
all
kinds
of
thoughts
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
problems
of
eating
and
sleeping
and
finding
a
home
for
the
children
the
egyptian
began
to
speculate
upon
many
strange
problems
that
confronted
him
where
did
the
stars
come
from
who
made
the
noise
of
the
thunder
which
frightened
him
so
terribly
who
made
the
river
nile
rise
with
such
regularity
that
it
was
possible
to
base
the
calendar
upon
the
appearance
and
the
disappearance
of
the
annual
floods
who
was
he
himself
a
strange
little
creature
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
death
and
sickness
and
yet
happy
and
full
of
laughter
he
asked
these
many
questions
and
certain
people
obligingly
stepped
forward
to
answer
these
inquiries
to
the
best
of
their
ability
the
egyptians
called
them
priests
and
they
became
the
guardians
of
his
thoughts
and
gained
great
respect
in
the
community
they
were
highly
learned
men
who
were
entrusted
with
the
sacred
task
of
keeping
the
written
records
they
understood
that
it
is
not
good
for
man
to
think
only
of
his
immediate
advantage
in
this
world
and
they
drew
his
attention
to
the
days
of
the
future
when
his
soul
would
dwell
beyond
the
mountains
of
the
west
and
must
give
an
account
of
his
deeds
to
osiris
the
mighty
god
who
was
the
ruler
of
the
living
and
the
dead
and
who
judged
the
acts
of
men
according
to
their
merits
indeed
the
priests
made
so
much
of
that
future
day
in
the
realm
of
isis
and
osiris
that
the
egyptians
began
to
regard
life
merely
as
a
short
preparation
for
the
hereafter
and
turned
the
teeming
valley
of
the
nile
into
a
land
devoted
to
the
dead
in
a
strange
way
the
egyptians
had
come
to
believe
that
no
soul
could
enter
the
realm
of
osiris
without
the
possession
of
the
body
which
had
been
its
place
of
residence
in
this
world
therefore
as
soon
as
a
man
was
dead
his
relatives
took
his
corpse
and
had
it
embalmed
for
weeks
it
was
soaked
in
a
solution
of
natron
and
then
it
was
filled
with
pitch
the
persian
word
for
pitch
was
mumiai
and
the
embalmed
body
was
called
a
mummy
it
was
wrapped
in
yards
and
yards
of
specially
prepared
linen
and
it
was
placed
in
a
specially
prepared
coffin
ready
to
be
removed
to
its
final
home
but
an
egyptian
grave
was
a
real
home
where
the
body
was
surrounded
by
pieces
of
furniture
and
musical
instruments
to
while
away
the
dreary
hours
of
waiting
and
by
little
statues
of
cooks
and
bakers
and
barbers
that
the
occupant
of
this
dark
home
might
be
decently
provided
with
food
and
need
not
go
about
unshaven
originally
these
graves
had
been
dug
into
the
rocks
of
the
western
mountains
but
as
the
egyptians
moved
northward
they
were
obliged
to
build
their
cemeteries
in
the
desert
the
desert
however
is
full
of
wild
animals
and
equally
wild
robbers
and
they
broke
into
the
graves
and
disturbed
the
mummy
or
stole
the
jewelry
that
had
been
buried
with
the
body
to
prevent
such
unholy
desecration
the
egyptians
used
to
build
small
mounds
of
stones
on
top
of
the
graves
these
little
mounds
gradually
grew
in
size
because
the
rich
people
built
higher
mounds
than
the
poor
and
there
was
a
good
deal
of
competition
to
see
who
could
make
the
highest
hill
of
stones
the
record
was
made
by
king
khufu
whom
the
greeks
called
cheops
and
who
lived
thirty
centuries
before
our
era
his
mound
which
the
greeks
called
a
pyramid
because
the
egyptian
word
for
high
was
was
over
five
hundred
feet
high
it
covered
more
than
thirteen
acres
of
desert
which
is
three
times
as
much
space
as
that
occupied
by
the
church
of
peter
the
largest
edifice
of
the
christian
world
during
twenty
years
over
a
hundred
thousand
men
were
busy
carrying
the
necessary
stones
from
the
other
side
of
the
river
ferrying
them
across
the
nile
how
they
ever
managed
to
do
this
we
do
not
understand
dragging
them
in
many
instances
a
long
distance
across
the
desert
and
finally
hoisting
them
into
their
correct
position
but
so
well
did
the
king
architects
and
engineers
perform
their
task
that
the
narrow
which
leads
to
the
royal
tomb
in
the
heart
of
the
stone
monster
has
never
yet
been
pushed
out
of
shape
by
the
weight
of
those
thousands
of
tons
of
stone
which
press
upon
it
from
all
sides
the
story
of
egypt
the
rise
and
fall
of
egypt
the
river
nile
was
a
kind
friend
but
occasionally
it
was
a
hard
taskmaster
it
taught
the
people
who
lived
along
its
banks
the
noble
art
of
they
depended
upon
each
other
to
build
their
irrigation
trenches
and
keep
their
dikes
in
repair
in
this
way
they
learned
how
to
get
along
with
their
neighbours
and
their
quite
easily
developed
into
an
organised
state
then
one
man
grew
more
powerful
than
most
of
his
neighbours
and
he
became
the
leader
of
the
community
and
their
when
the
envious
neighbours
of
western
asia
invaded
the
prosperous
valley
in
due
course
of
time
he
became
their
king
and
ruled
all
the
land
from
the
mediterranean
to
the
mountains
of
the
west
but
these
political
adventures
of
the
old
pharaohs
the
word
meant
the
man
who
lived
in
the
big
house
rarely
interested
the
patient
and
toiling
peasant
of
the
grain
fields
provided
he
was
not
obliged
to
pay
more
taxes
to
his
king
than
he
thought
just
he
accepted
the
rule
of
pharaoh
as
he
accepted
the
rule
of
mighty
osiris
it
was
different
however
when
a
foreign
invader
came
and
robbed
him
of
his
possessions
after
twenty
centuries
of
independent
life
a
savage
arab
tribe
of
shepherds
called
the
hyksos
attacked
egypt
and
for
five
hundred
years
they
were
the
masters
of
the
valley
of
the
nile
they
were
highly
and
great
hate
was
also
felt
for
the
hebrews
who
came
to
the
land
of
goshen
to
find
a
shelter
after
their
long
wandering
through
the
desert
and
who
helped
the
foreign
usurper
by
acting
as
his
and
his
civil
servants
but
shortly
after
the
year
the
people
of
thebes
began
a
revolution
and
after
a
long
struggle
the
hyksos
were
driven
out
of
the
country
and
egypt
was
free
once
more
a
thousand
years
later
when
assyria
conquered
all
of
western
asia
egypt
became
part
of
the
empire
of
sardanapalus
in
the
seventh
century
it
became
once
more
an
independent
state
which
obeyed
the
rule
of
a
king
who
lived
in
the
city
of
sais
in
the
delta
of
the
nile
but
in
the
year
cambyses
the
king
of
the
persians
took
possession
of
egypt
and
in
the
fourth
century
when
persia
was
conquered
by
alexander
the
great
egypt
too
became
a
macedonian
province
it
regained
a
semblance
of
independence
when
one
of
alexander
generals
set
himself
up
as
king
of
a
new
egyptian
state
and
founded
the
dynasty
of
the
ptolemies
who
resided
in
the
newly
built
city
of
alexandria
finally
in
the
year
the
romans
came
the
last
egyptian
queen
cleopatra
tried
her
best
to
save
the
country
her
beauty
and
charm
were
more
dangerous
to
the
roman
generals
than
half
a
dozen
egyptian
army
corps
twice
she
was
successful
in
her
attacks
upon
the
hearts
of
her
roman
conquerors
but
in
the
year
augustus
the
nephew
and
heir
of
caesar
landed
in
alexandria
he
did
not
share
his
late
admiration
for
the
lovely
princess
he
destroyed
her
armies
but
spared
her
life
that
he
might
make
her
march
in
his
triumph
as
part
of
the
spoils
of
war
when
cleopatra
heard
of
this
plan
she
killed
herself
by
taking
poison
and
egypt
became
a
roman
province
mesopotamia
mesopotamia
the
second
centre
of
eastern
civilisation
i
am
going
to
take
you
to
the
top
of
the
highest
pyramid
and
i
am
going
to
ask
that
you
imagine
yourself
possessed
of
the
eyes
of
a
hawk
way
way
off
in
the
distance
far
beyond
the
yellow
sands
of
the
desert
you
will
see
something
green
and
shimmering
it
is
a
valley
situated
between
two
rivers
it
is
the
paradise
of
the
old
testament
it
is
the
land
of
mystery
and
wonder
which
the
greeks
called
mesopotamia
the
country
between
the
rivers
the
names
of
the
two
rivers
are
the
euphrates
which
the
babylonians
called
the
purattu
and
the
tigris
which
was
known
as
the
diklat
they
begin
their
course
amidst
the
snows
of
the
mountains
of
armenia
where
noah
ark
found
a
resting
place
and
slowly
they
flow
through
the
southern
plain
until
they
reach
the
muddy
banks
of
the
persian
gulf
they
perform
a
very
useful
service
they
turn
the
arid
regions
of
western
asia
into
a
fertile
garden
the
valley
of
the
nile
had
attracted
people
because
it
had
offered
them
food
upon
fairly
easy
terms
the
land
between
the
rivers
was
popular
for
the
same
reason
it
was
a
country
full
of
promise
and
both
the
inhabitants
of
the
northern
mountains
and
the
tribes
which
roamed
through
the
southern
deserts
tried
to
claim
this
territory
as
their
own
and
most
exclusive
possession
the
constant
rivalry
between
the
mountaineers
and
the
led
to
endless
warfare
only
the
strongest
and
the
bravest
could
hope
to
survive
and
that
will
explain
why
mesopotamia
became
the
home
of
a
very
strong
race
of
men
who
were
capable
of
creating
a
civilisation
which
was
in
every
respect
as
important
as
that
of
egypt
the
sumerians
the
sumerian
nail
writers
whose
clay
tablets
tell
us
the
story
of
assyria
and
babylonia
the
great
semitic
the
fifteenth
century
was
an
age
of
great
discoveries
columbus
tried
to
find
a
way
to
the
island
of
kathay
and
stumbled
upon
a
new
and
unsuspected
continent
an
austrian
bishop
equipped
an
expedition
which
was
to
travel
eastward
and
find
the
home
of
the
grand
duke
of
muscovy
a
voyage
which
led
to
complete
failure
for
moscow
was
not
visited
by
western
men
until
a
generation
later
meanwhile
a
certain
venetian
by
the
name
of
barbero
had
explored
the
ruins
of
western
asia
and
had
brought
back
reports
of
a
most
curious
language
which
he
had
found
carved
in
the
rocks
of
the
temples
of
shiraz
and
engraved
upon
endless
pieces
of
baked
clay
but
europe
was
busy
with
many
other
things
and
it
was
not
until
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
that
the
first
cuneiform
inscriptions
because
the
letters
were
and
wedge
is
called
cuneus
in
latin
were
brought
to
europe
by
a
danish
surveyor
named
niebuhr
then
it
took
thirty
years
before
a
patient
german
by
the
name
of
grotefend
had
deciphered
the
first
four
letters
the
d
the
a
the
r
and
the
sh
the
name
of
the
persian
king
darius
and
another
twenty
years
had
to
go
by
until
a
british
officer
henry
rawlinson
who
found
the
famous
inscription
of
behistun
gave
us
a
workable
key
to
the
of
western
asia
compared
to
the
problem
of
deciphering
these
the
job
of
champollion
had
been
an
easy
one
the
egyptians
used
pictures
but
the
sumerians
the
earliest
inhabitants
of
mesopotamia
who
had
hit
upon
the
idea
of
scratching
their
words
in
tablets
of
clay
had
discarded
pictures
entirely
and
had
evolved
a
system
of
figures
which
showed
little
connection
with
the
pictures
out
of
which
they
had
been
developed
a
few
examples
will
show
you
what
i
mean
in
the
beginning
a
star
when
drawn
with
a
nail
into
a
brick
looked
as
follows
illust
this
sign
however
was
too
cumbersome
and
after
a
short
while
when
the
meaning
of
heaven
was
added
to
that
of
star
the
picture
was
simplified
in
this
way
illust
which
made
it
even
more
of
a
puzzle
in
the
same
way
an
ox
changed
from
illust
into
illust
and
a
fish
changed
from
illust
into
illust
the
sun
was
originally
a
plain
circle
illust
and
became
illust
if
we
were
using
the
sumerian
script
today
we
would
make
an
illust
look
like
this
system
of
writing
down
our
ideas
looks
rather
complicated
but
for
more
than
thirty
centuries
it
was
used
by
the
sumerians
and
the
babylonians
and
the
assyrians
and
the
persians
and
all
the
different
races
which
forced
their
way
into
the
fertile
valley
the
story
of
mesopotamia
is
one
of
endless
warfare
and
conquest
first
the
sumerians
came
from
the
north
they
were
a
white
people
who
had
lived
in
the
mountains
they
had
been
accustomed
to
worship
their
gods
on
the
tops
of
hills
after
they
had
entered
the
plain
they
constructed
artificial
little
hills
on
top
of
which
they
built
their
altars
they
did
not
know
how
to
build
stairs
and
they
therefore
surrounded
their
towers
with
sloping
galleries
our
engineers
have
borrowed
this
idea
as
you
may
see
in
our
big
railroad
stations
where
ascending
galleries
lead
from
one
floor
to
another
we
may
have
borrowed
other
ideas
from
the
sumerians
but
we
do
not
know
it
the
sumerians
were
entirely
by
those
races
that
entered
the
fertile
valley
at
a
later
date
their
towers
however
still
stand
amidst
the
ruins
of
mesopotamia
the
jews
saw
them
when
they
went
into
exile
in
the
land
of
babylon
and
they
called
them
towers
of
babillli
or
towers
of
babel
in
the
fortieth
century
before
our
era
the
sumerians
had
entered
mesopotamia
they
were
soon
afterwards
by
the
akkadians
one
of
the
many
tribes
from
the
desert
of
arabia
who
speak
a
common
dialect
and
who
are
known
as
the
semites
because
in
the
olden
days
people
believed
them
to
be
the
direct
descendants
of
shem
one
of
the
three
sons
of
noah
a
thousand
years
later
the
akkadians
were
forced
to
submit
to
the
rule
of
the
amorites
another
semitic
desert
tribe
whose
great
king
hammurabi
built
himself
a
magnificent
palace
in
the
holy
city
of
babylon
and
who
gave
his
people
a
set
of
laws
which
made
the
babylonian
state
the
best
administered
empire
of
the
ancient
world
next
the
hittites
whom
you
will
also
meet
in
the
old
testament
the
fertile
valley
and
destroyed
whatever
they
could
not
carry
away
they
in
turn
were
vanquished
by
the
followers
of
the
great
desert
god
ashur
who
called
themselves
assyrians
and
who
made
the
city
of
nineveh
the
center
of
a
vast
and
terrible
empire
which
conquered
all
of
western
asia
and
egypt
and
gathered
taxes
from
countless
subject
races
until
the
end
of
the
seventh
century
before
the
birth
of
christ
when
the
chaldeans
also
a
semitic
tribe
babylon
and
made
that
city
the
most
important
capital
of
that
day
nebuchadnezzar
the
best
known
of
their
kings
encouraged
the
study
of
science
and
our
modern
knowledge
of
astronomy
and
mathematics
is
all
based
upon
certain
first
principles
which
were
discovered
by
the
chaldeans
in
the
year
a
crude
tribe
of
persian
shepherds
invaded
this
old
land
and
overthrew
the
empire
of
the
chaldeans
two
hundred
years
later
they
in
turn
were
overthrown
by
alexander
the
great
who
turned
the
fertile
valley
the
old
of
so
many
semitic
races
into
a
greek
province
next
came
the
romans
and
after
the
romans
the
turks
and
mesopotamia
the
second
centre
of
the
world
civilisation
became
a
vast
wilderness
where
huge
mounds
of
earth
told
a
story
of
ancient
glory
moses
the
story
of
moses
the
leader
of
the
jewish
people
some
time
during
the
twentieth
century
before
our
era
a
small
and
unimportant
tribe
of
semitic
shepherds
had
left
its
old
home
which
was
situated
in
the
land
of
ur
on
the
mouth
of
the
euphrates
and
had
tried
to
find
new
pastures
within
the
domain
of
the
kings
of
babylonia
they
had
been
driven
away
by
the
royal
soldiers
and
they
had
moved
westward
looking
for
a
little
piece
of
unoccupied
territory
where
they
might
set
up
their
tents
this
tribe
of
shepherds
was
known
as
the
hebrews
or
as
we
call
them
the
jews
they
had
wandered
far
and
wide
and
after
many
years
of
dreary
peregrinations
they
had
been
given
shelter
in
egypt
for
more
than
five
centuries
they
had
dwelt
among
the
egyptians
and
when
their
adopted
country
had
been
overrun
by
the
hyksos
marauders
as
i
told
you
in
the
story
of
egypt
they
had
managed
to
make
themselves
useful
to
the
foreign
invader
and
had
been
left
in
the
undisturbed
possession
of
their
grazing
fields
but
after
a
long
war
of
independence
the
egyptians
had
driven
the
hyksos
out
of
the
valley
of
the
nile
and
then
the
jews
had
come
upon
evil
times
for
they
had
been
degraded
to
the
rank
of
common
slaves
and
they
had
been
forced
to
work
on
the
royal
roads
and
on
the
pyramids
and
as
the
frontiers
were
guarded
by
the
egyptian
soldiers
it
had
been
impossible
for
the
jews
to
escape
after
many
years
of
suffering
they
were
saved
from
their
miserable
fate
by
a
young
jew
called
moses
who
for
a
long
time
had
dwelt
in
the
desert
and
there
had
learned
to
appreciate
the
simple
virtues
of
his
earliest
ancestors
who
had
kept
away
from
cities
and
and
had
refused
to
let
themselves
be
corrupted
by
the
ease
and
the
luxury
of
a
foreign
civilisation
moses
decided
to
bring
his
people
back
to
a
love
of
the
ways
of
the
patriarchs
he
succeeded
in
evading
the
egyptian
troops
that
were
sent
after
him
and
led
his
fellow
tribesmen
into
the
heart
of
the
plain
at
the
foot
of
mount
sinai
during
his
long
and
lonely
life
in
the
desert
he
had
learned
to
revere
the
strength
of
the
great
god
of
the
thunder
and
the
storm
who
ruled
the
high
heavens
and
upon
whom
the
shepherds
depended
for
life
and
light
and
breath
this
god
one
of
the
many
divinities
who
were
widely
worshipped
in
western
asia
was
called
jehovah
and
through
the
teaching
of
moses
he
became
the
sole
master
of
the
hebrew
race
one
day
moses
disappeared
from
the
camp
of
the
jews
it
was
whispered
that
he
had
gone
away
carrying
two
tablets
of
stone
that
afternoon
the
top
of
the
mountain
was
lost
to
sight
the
darkness
of
a
terrible
storm
hid
it
from
the
eye
of
man
but
when
moses
returned
behold
there
stood
engraved
upon
the
tablets
the
words
which
jehovah
had
spoken
unto
the
people
of
israel
amidst
the
crash
of
his
thunder
and
the
blinding
flashes
of
his
lightning
and
from
that
moment
jehovah
was
recognised
by
all
the
jews
as
the
highest
master
of
their
fate
the
only
true
god
who
had
taught
them
how
to
live
holy
lives
when
he
bade
them
to
follow
the
wise
lessons
of
his
ten
commandments
they
followed
moses
when
he
bade
them
continue
their
journey
through
the
desert
they
obeyed
him
when
he
told
them
what
to
eat
and
drink
and
what
to
avoid
that
they
might
keep
well
in
the
hot
climate
and
finally
after
many
years
of
wandering
they
came
to
a
land
which
seemed
pleasant
and
prosperous
it
was
called
palestine
which
means
the
country
of
the
pilistu
the
philistines
a
small
tribe
of
cretans
who
had
settled
along
the
coast
after
they
had
been
driven
away
from
their
own
island
unfortunately
the
mainland
palestine
was
already
inhabited
by
another
semitic
race
called
the
canaanites
but
the
jews
forced
their
way
into
the
valleys
and
built
themselves
cities
and
constructed
a
mighty
temple
in
a
town
which
they
named
jerusalem
the
home
of
peace
as
for
moses
he
was
no
longer
the
leader
of
his
people
he
had
been
allowed
to
see
the
mountain
ridges
of
palestine
from
afar
then
he
had
closed
his
tired
eyes
for
all
time
he
had
worked
faithfully
and
hard
to
please
jehovah
not
only
had
he
guided
his
brethren
out
of
foreign
slavery
into
the
free
and
independent
life
of
a
new
home
but
he
had
also
made
the
jews
the
first
of
all
nations
to
worship
a
single
god
the
phoenicians
the
phoenicians
who
gave
us
our
alphabet
the
phoenicians
who
were
the
neighbours
of
the
jews
were
a
semitic
tribe
which
at
a
very
early
age
had
settled
along
the
shores
of
the
mediterranean
they
had
built
themselves
two
towns
tyre
and
sidon
and
within
a
short
time
they
had
gained
a
monopoly
of
the
trade
of
the
western
seas
their
ships
went
regularly
to
greece
and
italy
and
spain
and
they
even
ventured
beyond
the
straits
of
gibraltar
to
visit
the
scilly
islands
where
they
could
buy
tin
wherever
they
went
they
built
themselves
small
trading
stations
which
they
called
colonies
many
of
these
were
the
origin
of
modern
cities
such
as
cadiz
and
marseilles
they
bought
and
sold
whatever
promised
to
bring
them
a
good
profit
they
were
not
troubled
by
a
conscience
if
we
are
to
believe
all
their
neighbours
they
did
not
know
what
the
words
honesty
or
integrity
meant
they
regarded
a
treasure
chest
the
highest
ideal
of
all
good
citizens
indeed
they
were
very
unpleasant
people
and
did
not
have
a
single
friend
nevertheless
they
have
rendered
all
coming
generations
one
service
of
the
greatest
possible
value
they
gave
us
our
alphabet
the
phoenicians
had
been
familiar
with
the
art
of
writing
invented
by
the
sumerians
but
they
regarded
these
pothooks
as
a
clumsy
waste
of
time
they
were
practical
business
men
and
could
not
spend
hours
engraving
two
or
three
letters
they
set
to
work
and
invented
a
new
system
of
writing
which
was
greatly
superior
to
the
old
one
they
borrowed
a
few
pictures
from
the
egyptians
and
they
simplified
a
number
of
the
figures
of
the
sumerians
they
sacrificed
the
pretty
looks
of
the
older
system
for
the
advantage
of
speed
and
they
reduced
the
thousands
of
different
images
to
a
short
and
handy
alphabet
of
letters
in
due
course
of
time
this
alphabet
travelled
across
the
aegean
sea
and
entered
greece
the
greeks
added
a
few
letters
of
their
own
and
carried
the
improved
system
to
italy
the
romans
modified
the
figures
somewhat
and
in
turn
taught
them
to
the
wild
barbarians
of
western
europe
those
wild
barbarians
were
our
own
ancestors
and
that
is
the
reason
why
this
book
is
written
in
characters
that
are
of
phoenician
origin
and
not
in
the
hieroglyphics
of
the
egyptians
or
in
the
of
the
sumerians
the
the
persians
conquer
the
semitic
and
the
egyptian
world
the
world
of
egypt
and
babylon
and
assyria
and
phoenicia
had
existed
almost
thirty
centuries
and
the
venerable
races
of
the
fertile
valley
were
getting
old
and
tired
their
doom
was
sealed
when
a
new
and
more
energetic
race
appeared
upon
the
horizon
we
call
this
race
the
race
because
it
conquered
not
only
europe
but
also
made
itself
the
ruling
class
in
the
country
which
is
now
known
as
british
india
these
were
white
men
like
the
semites
but
they
spoke
a
different
language
which
is
regarded
as
the
common
ancestor
of
all
european
tongues
with
the
exception
of
hungarian
and
finnish
and
the
basque
dialects
of
northern
spain
when
we
first
hear
of
them
they
had
been
living
along
the
shores
of
the
caspian
sea
for
many
centuries
but
one
day
they
had
packed
their
tents
and
they
had
wandered
forth
in
search
of
a
new
home
some
of
them
had
moved
into
the
mountains
of
central
asia
and
for
many
centuries
they
had
lived
among
the
peaks
which
surround
the
plateau
of
iran
and
that
is
why
we
call
them
aryans
others
had
followed
the
setting
sun
and
they
had
taken
possession
of
the
plains
of
europe
as
i
shall
tell
you
when
i
give
you
the
story
of
greece
and
rome
for
the
moment
we
must
follow
the
aryans
under
the
leadership
of
zarathustra
or
zoroaster
who
was
their
great
teacher
many
of
them
had
left
their
mountain
homes
to
follow
the
swiftly
flowing
indus
river
on
its
way
to
the
sea
others
had
preferred
to
stay
among
the
hills
of
western
asia
and
there
they
had
founded
the
communities
of
the
medes
and
the
persians
two
peoples
whose
names
we
have
copied
from
the
old
greek
in
the
seventh
century
before
the
birth
of
christ
the
medes
had
established
a
kingdom
of
their
own
called
media
but
this
perished
when
cyrus
the
chief
of
a
clan
known
as
the
anshan
made
himself
king
of
all
the
persian
tribes
and
started
upon
a
career
of
conquest
which
soon
made
him
and
his
children
the
undisputed
masters
of
the
whole
of
western
asia
and
of
egypt
indeed
with
such
energy
did
these
persians
push
their
triumphant
campaigns
in
the
west
that
they
soon
found
themselves
in
serious
difficulties
with
certain
other
tribes
which
centuries
before
had
moved
into
europe
and
had
taken
possession
of
the
greek
peninsula
and
the
islands
of
the
aegean
sea
these
difficulties
led
to
the
three
famous
wars
between
greece
and
persia
during
which
king
darius
and
king
xerxes
of
persia
invaded
the
northern
part
of
the
peninsula
they
ravaged
the
lands
of
the
greeks
and
tried
very
hard
to
get
a
foothold
upon
the
european
continent
but
in
this
they
did
not
succeed
the
navy
of
athens
proved
unconquerable
by
cutting
off
the
lines
of
supplies
of
the
persian
armies
the
greek
sailors
invariably
forced
the
asiatic
rulers
to
return
to
their
base
it
was
the
first
encounter
between
asia
the
ancient
teacher
and
europe
the
young
and
eager
pupil
a
great
many
of
the
other
chapters
of
this
book
will
tell
you
how
the
struggle
between
east
and
west
has
continued
until
this
very
day
the
aegean
sea
the
people
of
the
aegean
sea
carried
the
civilisation
of
old
asia
into
the
wilderness
of
europe
when
heinrich
schliemann
was
a
little
boy
his
father
told
him
the
story
of
troy
he
liked
that
story
better
than
anything
else
he
had
ever
heard
and
he
made
up
his
mind
that
as
soon
as
he
was
big
enough
to
leave
home
he
would
travel
to
greece
and
find
troy
that
he
was
the
son
of
a
poor
country
parson
in
a
mecklenburg
village
did
not
bother
him
he
knew
that
he
would
need
money
but
he
decided
to
gather
a
fortune
first
and
do
the
digging
afterwards
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
managed
to
get
a
large
fortune
within
a
very
short
time
and
as
soon
as
he
had
enough
money
to
equip
an
expedition
he
went
to
the
northwest
corner
of
asia
minor
where
he
supposed
that
troy
had
been
situated
in
that
particular
nook
of
old
asia
minor
stood
a
high
mound
covered
with
grainfields
according
to
tradition
it
had
been
the
home
of
priamus
the
king
of
troy
schliemann
whose
enthusiasm
was
somewhat
greater
than
his
knowledge
wasted
no
time
in
preliminary
explorations
at
once
he
began
to
dig
and
he
dug
with
such
zeal
and
such
speed
that
his
trench
went
straight
through
the
heart
of
the
city
for
which
he
was
looking
and
carried
him
to
the
ruins
of
another
buried
town
which
was
at
least
a
thousand
years
older
than
the
troy
of
which
homer
had
written
then
something
very
interesting
occurred
if
schliemann
had
found
a
few
polished
stone
hammers
and
perhaps
a
few
pieces
of
crude
pottery
no
one
would
have
been
surprised
instead
of
discovering
such
objects
which
people
had
generally
associated
with
the
prehistoric
men
who
had
lived
in
these
regions
before
the
coming
of
the
greeks
schliemann
found
beautiful
statuettes
and
very
costly
jewelry
and
ornamented
vases
of
a
pattern
that
was
unknown
to
the
greeks
he
ventured
the
suggestion
that
fully
ten
centuries
before
the
great
trojan
war
the
coast
of
the
aegean
had
been
inhabited
by
a
mysterious
race
of
men
who
in
many
ways
had
been
the
superiors
of
the
wild
greek
tribes
who
had
invaded
their
country
and
had
destroyed
their
civilisation
or
absorbed
it
until
it
had
lost
all
trace
of
originality
and
this
proved
to
be
the
case
in
the
late
seventies
of
the
last
century
schliemann
visited
the
ruins
of
mycenae
ruins
which
were
so
old
that
roman
marvelled
at
their
antiquity
there
again
beneath
the
flat
slabs
of
stone
of
a
small
round
enclosure
schliemann
stumbled
upon
a
wonderful
which
had
been
left
behind
by
those
mysterious
people
who
had
covered
the
greek
coast
with
their
cities
and
who
had
built
walls
so
big
and
so
heavy
and
so
strong
that
the
greeks
called
them
the
work
of
the
titans
those
giants
who
in
very
olden
days
had
used
to
play
ball
with
mountain
peaks
a
very
careful
study
of
these
many
relics
has
done
away
with
some
of
the
romantic
features
of
the
story
the
makers
of
these
early
works
of
art
and
the
builders
of
these
strong
fortresses
were
no
sorcerers
but
simple
sailors
and
traders
they
had
lived
in
crete
and
on
the
many
small
islands
of
the
aegean
sea
they
had
been
hardy
mariners
and
they
had
turned
the
aegean
into
a
center
of
commerce
for
the
exchange
of
goods
between
the
highly
civilised
east
and
the
slowly
developing
wilderness
of
the
european
mainland
for
more
than
a
thousand
years
they
had
maintained
an
island
empire
which
had
developed
a
very
high
form
of
art
indeed
their
most
important
city
cnossus
on
the
northern
coast
of
crete
had
been
entirely
modern
in
its
insistence
upon
hygiene
and
comfort
the
palace
had
been
properly
drained
and
the
houses
had
been
provided
with
stoves
and
the
cnossians
had
been
the
first
people
to
make
a
daily
use
of
the
hitherto
unknown
bathtub
the
palace
of
their
king
had
been
famous
for
its
winding
staircases
and
its
large
banqueting
hall
the
cellars
underneath
this
palace
where
the
wine
and
the
grain
and
the
were
stored
had
been
so
vast
and
had
so
greatly
impressed
the
first
greek
visitors
that
they
had
given
rise
to
the
story
of
the
labyrinth
the
name
which
we
give
to
a
structure
with
so
many
complicated
passages
that
it
is
almost
impossible
to
find
our
way
out
once
the
front
door
has
closed
upon
our
frightened
selves
but
what
finally
became
of
this
great
aegean
empire
and
what
caused
its
sudden
downfall
that
i
can
not
tell
the
cretans
were
familiar
with
the
art
of
writing
but
no
one
has
yet
been
able
to
decipher
their
inscriptions
their
history
therefore
is
unknown
to
us
we
have
to
reconstruct
the
record
of
their
adventures
from
the
ruins
which
the
aegeans
have
left
behind
these
ruins
make
it
clear
that
the
aegean
world
was
suddenly
conquered
by
a
less
civilised
race
which
had
recently
come
from
the
plains
of
northern
europe
unless
we
are
very
much
mistaken
the
savages
who
were
responsible
for
the
destruction
of
the
cretan
and
the
aegean
civilisation
were
none
other
than
certain
tribes
of
wandering
shepherds
who
had
just
taken
possession
of
the
rocky
peninsula
between
the
adriatic
and
the
aegean
seas
and
who
are
known
to
us
as
greeks
the
greeks
meanwhile
the
tribe
of
the
hellenes
was
taking
possession
of
greece
the
pyramids
were
a
thousand
years
old
and
were
beginning
to
show
the
first
signs
of
decay
and
hammurabi
the
wise
king
of
babylon
had
been
dead
and
buried
several
centuries
when
a
small
tribe
of
shepherds
left
their
homes
along
the
banks
of
the
river
danube
and
wandered
southward
in
search
of
fresh
pastures
they
called
themselves
hellenes
after
hellen
the
son
of
deucalion
and
pyrrha
according
to
the
old
myths
these
were
the
only
two
human
beings
who
had
escaped
the
great
flood
which
countless
years
before
had
destroyed
all
the
people
of
the
world
when
they
had
grown
so
wicked
that
they
disgusted
zeus
the
mighty
god
who
lived
on
mount
olympus
of
these
early
hellenes
we
know
nothing
thucydides
the
historian
of
the
fall
of
athens
describing
his
earliest
ancestors
said
that
they
did
not
amount
to
very
much
and
this
was
probably
true
they
were
very
they
lived
like
pigs
and
threw
the
bodies
of
their
enemies
to
the
wild
dogs
who
guarded
their
sheep
they
had
very
little
respect
for
other
people
rights
and
they
killed
the
natives
of
the
greek
peninsula
who
were
called
the
pelasgians
and
stole
their
farms
and
took
their
cattle
and
made
their
wives
and
daughters
slaves
and
wrote
endless
songs
praising
the
courage
of
the
clan
of
the
achaeans
who
had
led
the
hellenic
into
the
mountains
of
thessaly
and
the
peloponnesus
but
here
and
there
on
the
tops
of
high
rocks
they
saw
the
castles
of
the
aegeans
and
those
they
did
not
attack
for
they
feared
the
metal
swords
and
the
spears
of
the
aegean
soldiers
and
knew
that
they
could
not
hope
to
defeat
them
with
their
clumsy
stone
axes
for
many
centuries
they
continued
to
wander
from
valley
to
valley
and
from
mountain
side
to
mountain
side
then
the
whole
of
the
land
had
been
occupied
and
the
migration
had
come
to
an
end
that
moment
was
the
beginning
of
greek
civilisation
the
greek
farmer
living
within
sight
of
the
aegean
colonies
was
finally
driven
by
curiosity
to
visit
his
haughty
neighbours
he
discovered
that
he
could
learn
many
useful
things
from
the
men
who
dwelt
behind
the
high
stone
walls
of
mycenae
and
tiryns
he
was
a
clever
pupil
within
a
short
time
he
mastered
the
art
of
handling
those
strange
iron
weapons
which
the
aegeans
had
brought
from
babylon
and
from
thebes
he
came
to
understand
the
mysteries
of
navigation
he
began
to
build
little
boats
for
his
own
use
and
when
he
had
learned
everything
the
aegeans
could
teach
him
he
turned
upon
his
teachers
and
drove
them
back
to
their
islands
soon
afterwards
he
ventured
forth
upon
the
sea
and
conquered
all
the
cities
of
the
aegean
finally
in
the
fifteenth
century
before
our
era
he
plundered
and
ravaged
cnossus
and
ten
centuries
after
their
first
appearance
upon
the
scene
the
hellenes
were
the
undisputed
rulers
of
greece
of
the
aegean
and
of
the
coastal
regions
of
asia
minor
troy
the
last
great
commercial
stronghold
of
the
older
civilisation
was
destroyed
in
the
eleventh
century
european
history
was
to
begin
in
all
seriousness
the
greek
cities
the
greek
cities
that
were
really
states
we
modern
people
love
the
sound
of
the
word
big
we
pride
ourselves
upon
the
fact
that
we
belong
to
the
biggest
country
in
the
world
and
possess
the
biggest
navy
and
grow
the
biggest
oranges
and
potatoes
and
we
love
to
live
in
cities
of
millions
of
inhabitants
and
when
we
are
dead
we
are
buried
in
the
biggest
cemetery
of
the
whole
state
a
citizen
of
ancient
greece
could
he
have
heard
us
talk
would
not
have
known
what
we
meant
moderation
in
all
things
was
the
ideal
of
his
life
and
mere
bulk
did
not
impress
him
at
all
and
this
love
of
moderation
was
not
merely
a
hollow
phrase
used
upon
special
occasions
it
influenced
the
life
of
the
greeks
from
the
day
of
their
birth
to
the
hour
of
their
death
it
was
part
of
their
literature
and
it
made
them
build
small
but
perfect
temples
it
found
expression
in
the
clothes
which
the
men
wore
and
in
the
rings
and
the
bracelets
of
their
wives
it
followed
the
crowds
that
went
to
the
theatre
and
made
them
hoot
down
any
playwright
who
dared
to
sin
against
the
iron
law
of
good
taste
or
good
sense
the
greeks
even
insisted
upon
this
quality
in
their
politicians
and
in
their
most
popular
athletes
when
a
powerful
runner
came
to
sparta
and
boasted
that
he
could
stand
longer
on
one
foot
than
any
other
man
in
hellas
the
people
drove
him
from
the
city
because
he
prided
himself
upon
an
accomplishment
at
which
he
could
be
beaten
by
any
common
goose
that
is
all
very
well
you
will
say
and
no
doubt
it
is
a
great
virtue
to
care
so
much
for
moderation
and
perfection
but
why
should
the
greeks
have
been
the
only
people
to
develop
this
quality
in
olden
times
for
an
answer
i
shall
point
to
the
way
in
which
the
greeks
lived
the
people
of
egypt
or
mesopotamia
had
been
the
subjects
of
a
mysterious
supreme
ruler
who
lived
miles
and
miles
away
in
a
dark
palace
and
who
was
rarely
seen
by
the
masses
of
the
population
the
greeks
on
the
other
hand
were
free
citizens
of
a
hundred
independent
little
cities
the
largest
of
which
counted
fewer
inhabitants
than
a
large
modern
village
when
a
peasant
who
lived
in
ur
said
that
he
was
a
babylonian
he
meant
that
he
was
one
of
millions
of
other
people
who
paid
tribute
to
the
king
who
at
that
particular
moment
happened
to
be
master
of
western
asia
but
when
a
greek
said
proudly
that
he
was
an
athenian
or
a
theban
he
spoke
of
a
small
town
which
was
both
his
home
and
his
country
and
which
recognised
no
master
but
the
will
of
the
people
in
the
to
the
greek
his
fatherland
was
the
place
where
he
was
born
where
he
had
spent
his
earliest
years
playing
hide
and
seek
amidst
the
forbidden
rocks
of
the
acropolis
where
he
had
grown
into
manhood
with
a
thousand
other
boys
and
girls
whose
nicknames
were
as
familiar
to
him
as
those
of
your
own
schoolmates
his
fatherland
was
the
holy
soil
where
his
father
and
mother
lay
buried
it
was
the
small
house
within
the
high
where
his
wife
and
children
lived
in
safety
it
was
a
complete
world
which
covered
no
more
than
four
or
five
acres
of
rocky
land
do
you
see
how
these
surroundings
must
have
influenced
a
man
in
everything
he
did
and
said
and
thought
the
people
of
babylon
and
assyria
and
egypt
had
been
part
of
a
vast
mob
they
had
been
lost
in
the
multitude
the
greek
on
the
other
hand
had
never
lost
touch
with
his
immediate
surroundings
he
never
ceased
to
be
part
of
a
little
town
where
everybody
knew
every
one
else
he
felt
that
his
intelligent
neighbours
were
watching
him
whatever
he
did
whether
he
wrote
plays
or
made
statues
out
of
marble
or
composed
songs
he
remembered
that
his
efforts
were
going
to
be
judged
by
all
the
citizens
of
his
who
knew
about
such
things
this
knowledge
forced
him
to
strive
after
perfection
and
perfection
as
he
had
been
taught
from
childhood
was
not
possible
without
moderation
in
this
hard
school
the
greeks
learned
to
excel
in
many
things
they
created
new
forms
of
government
and
new
forms
of
literature
and
new
ideals
in
art
which
we
have
never
been
able
to
surpass
they
performed
these
miracles
in
little
villages
that
covered
less
ground
than
four
or
five
modern
city
blocks
and
look
what
finally
happened
in
the
fourth
century
before
our
era
alexander
of
macedonia
conquered
the
world
as
soon
as
he
had
done
with
fighting
alexander
decided
that
he
must
bestow
the
benefits
of
the
true
greek
genius
upon
all
mankind
he
took
it
away
from
the
little
cities
and
the
little
villages
and
tried
to
make
it
blossom
and
bear
fruit
amidst
the
vast
royal
residences
of
his
newly
acquired
empire
but
the
greeks
removed
from
the
familiar
sight
of
their
own
temples
removed
from
the
sounds
and
smells
of
their
own
crooked
streets
at
once
lost
the
cheerful
joy
and
the
marvellous
sense
of
moderation
which
had
inspired
the
work
of
their
hands
and
brains
while
they
laboured
for
the
glory
of
their
old
they
became
cheap
artisans
content
with
work
the
day
the
little
of
old
hellas
lost
their
independence
and
were
forced
to
become
part
of
a
big
nation
the
old
greek
spirit
died
and
it
has
been
dead
ever
since
greek
the
greeks
were
the
first
people
to
try
the
difficult
experiment
of
in
the
beginning
all
the
greeks
had
been
equally
rich
and
equally
poor
every
man
had
owned
a
certain
number
of
cows
and
sheep
his
had
been
his
castle
he
had
been
free
to
come
and
go
as
he
wished
whenever
it
was
necessary
to
discuss
matters
of
public
importance
all
the
citizens
had
gathered
in
the
one
of
the
older
men
of
the
village
was
elected
chairman
and
it
was
his
duty
to
see
that
everybody
had
a
chance
to
express
his
views
in
case
of
war
a
particularly
energetic
and
villager
was
chosen
but
the
same
people
who
had
voluntarily
given
this
man
the
right
to
be
their
leader
claimed
an
equal
right
to
deprive
him
of
his
job
once
the
danger
had
been
averted
but
gradually
the
village
had
grown
into
a
city
some
people
had
worked
hard
and
others
had
been
lazy
a
few
had
been
unlucky
and
still
others
had
been
just
plain
dishonest
in
dealing
with
their
neighbours
and
had
gathered
wealth
as
a
result
the
city
no
longer
consisted
of
a
number
of
men
who
were
equally
on
the
contrary
it
was
inhabited
by
a
small
class
of
very
rich
people
and
a
large
class
of
very
poor
ones
there
had
been
another
change
the
old
who
had
been
willingly
recognised
as
headman
or
king
because
he
knew
how
to
lead
his
men
to
victory
had
disappeared
from
the
scene
his
place
had
been
taken
by
the
nobles
a
class
of
rich
people
who
during
the
course
of
time
had
got
hold
of
an
undue
share
of
the
farms
and
estates
these
nobles
enjoyed
many
advantages
over
the
common
crowd
of
freemen
they
were
able
to
buy
the
best
weapons
which
were
to
be
found
on
the
market
of
the
eastern
mediterranean
they
had
much
spare
time
in
which
they
could
practise
the
art
of
fighting
they
lived
in
strongly
built
houses
and
they
could
hire
soldiers
to
fight
for
them
they
were
constantly
quarrelling
among
each
other
to
decide
who
should
rule
the
city
the
victorious
nobleman
then
assumed
a
sort
of
kingship
over
all
his
neighbours
and
governed
the
town
until
he
in
turn
was
killed
or
driven
away
by
still
another
ambitious
nobleman
such
a
king
by
the
grace
of
his
soldiers
was
called
a
tyrant
and
during
the
seventh
and
sixth
centuries
before
our
era
every
greek
city
was
for
a
time
ruled
by
such
tyrants
many
of
whom
by
the
way
happened
to
be
exceedingly
men
but
in
the
long
run
this
state
of
affairs
became
unbearable
then
attempts
were
made
to
bring
about
reforms
and
out
of
these
reforms
grew
the
first
democratic
government
of
which
the
world
has
a
record
it
was
early
in
the
seventh
century
that
the
people
of
athens
decided
to
do
some
housecleaning
and
give
the
large
number
of
freemen
once
more
a
voice
in
the
government
as
they
were
supposed
to
have
had
in
the
days
of
their
achaean
ancestors
they
asked
a
man
by
the
name
of
draco
to
provide
them
with
a
set
of
laws
that
would
protect
the
poor
against
the
aggressions
of
the
rich
draco
set
to
work
unfortunately
he
was
a
professional
lawyer
and
very
much
out
of
touch
with
ordinary
life
in
his
eyes
a
crime
was
a
crime
and
when
he
had
finished
his
code
the
people
of
athens
discovered
that
these
draconian
laws
were
so
severe
that
they
could
not
possibly
be
put
into
effect
there
would
not
have
been
rope
enough
to
hang
all
the
criminals
under
their
new
system
of
jurisprudence
which
made
the
stealing
of
an
apple
a
capital
offence
the
athenians
looked
about
for
a
more
humane
reformer
at
last
they
found
some
one
who
could
do
that
sort
of
thing
better
than
anybody
else
his
name
was
solon
he
belonged
to
a
noble
family
and
he
had
travelled
all
over
the
world
and
had
studied
the
forms
of
government
of
many
other
countries
after
a
careful
study
of
the
subject
solon
gave
athens
a
set
of
laws
which
bore
testimony
to
that
wonderful
principle
of
moderation
which
was
part
of
the
greek
character
he
tried
to
improve
the
condition
of
the
peasant
without
however
destroying
the
prosperity
of
the
nobles
who
were
or
rather
who
could
be
of
such
great
service
to
the
state
as
soldiers
to
protect
the
poorer
classes
against
abuse
on
the
part
of
the
judges
who
were
always
elected
from
the
class
of
the
nobles
because
they
received
no
salary
solon
made
a
provision
whereby
a
citizen
with
a
grievance
had
the
right
to
state
his
case
before
a
jury
of
thirty
of
his
fellow
athenians
most
important
of
all
solon
forced
the
average
freeman
to
take
a
direct
and
personal
interest
in
the
affairs
of
the
city
no
longer
could
he
stay
at
home
and
say
oh
i
am
too
busy
today
or
it
is
raining
and
i
had
better
stay
indoors
he
was
expected
to
do
his
share
to
be
at
the
meeting
of
the
town
council
and
carry
part
of
the
responsibility
for
the
safety
and
the
prosperity
of
the
state
this
government
by
the
demos
the
people
was
often
far
from
successful
there
was
too
much
idle
talk
there
were
too
many
hateful
and
spiteful
scenes
between
rivals
for
official
honor
but
it
taught
the
greek
people
to
be
independent
and
to
rely
upon
themselves
for
their
salvation
and
that
was
a
very
good
thing
greek
life
how
the
greeks
lived
but
how
you
will
ask
did
the
ancient
greeks
have
time
to
look
after
their
families
and
their
business
if
they
were
forever
running
to
the
to
discuss
affairs
of
state
in
this
chapter
i
shall
tell
you
in
all
matters
of
government
the
greek
democracy
recognised
only
one
class
of
citizens
the
freemen
every
greek
city
was
composed
of
a
small
number
of
free
born
citizens
a
large
number
of
slaves
and
a
sprinkling
of
foreigners
at
rare
intervals
usually
during
a
war
when
men
were
needed
for
the
army
the
greeks
showed
themselves
willing
to
confer
the
rights
of
citizenship
upon
the
barbarians
as
they
called
the
foreigners
but
this
was
an
exception
citizenship
was
a
matter
of
birth
you
were
an
athenian
because
your
father
and
your
grandfather
had
been
athenians
before
you
but
however
great
your
merits
as
a
trader
or
a
soldier
if
you
were
born
of
parents
you
remained
a
foreigner
until
the
end
of
time
the
greek
city
therefore
whenever
it
was
not
ruled
by
a
king
or
a
tyrant
was
run
by
and
for
the
freemen
and
this
would
not
have
been
possible
without
a
large
army
of
slaves
who
outnumbered
the
free
citizens
at
the
rate
of
six
or
five
to
one
and
who
performed
those
tasks
to
which
we
modern
people
must
devote
most
of
our
time
and
energy
if
we
wish
to
provide
for
our
families
and
pay
the
rent
of
our
apartments
the
slaves
did
all
the
cooking
and
baking
and
candlestick
making
of
the
entire
city
they
were
the
tailors
and
the
carpenters
and
the
jewelers
and
the
and
the
bookkeepers
and
they
tended
the
store
and
looked
after
the
factory
while
the
master
went
to
the
public
meeting
to
discuss
questions
of
war
and
peace
or
visited
the
theatre
to
see
the
latest
play
of
aeschylus
or
hear
a
discussion
of
the
revolutionary
ideas
of
euripides
who
had
dared
to
express
certain
doubts
upon
the
omnipotence
of
the
great
god
zeus
indeed
ancient
athens
resembled
a
modern
club
all
the
freeborn
citizens
were
hereditary
members
and
all
the
slaves
were
hereditary
servants
and
waited
upon
the
needs
of
their
masters
and
it
was
very
pleasant
to
be
a
member
of
the
organisation
but
when
we
talk
about
slaves
we
do
not
mean
the
sort
of
people
about
whom
you
have
read
in
the
pages
of
uncle
tom
cabin
it
is
true
that
the
position
of
those
slaves
who
tilled
the
fields
was
a
very
unpleasant
one
but
the
average
freeman
who
had
come
down
in
the
world
and
who
had
been
obliged
to
hire
himself
out
as
a
farm
hand
led
just
as
miserable
a
life
in
the
cities
furthermore
many
of
the
slaves
were
more
prosperous
than
the
poorer
classes
of
the
freemen
for
the
greeks
who
loved
moderation
in
all
things
did
not
like
to
treat
their
slaves
after
the
fashion
which
afterward
was
so
common
in
rome
where
a
slave
had
as
few
rights
as
an
engine
in
a
modern
factory
and
could
be
thrown
to
the
wild
animals
upon
the
smallest
pretext
the
greeks
accepted
slavery
as
a
necessary
institution
without
which
no
city
could
possibly
become
the
home
of
a
truly
civilised
people
the
slaves
also
took
care
of
those
tasks
which
nowadays
are
performed
by
the
business
men
and
the
professional
men
as
for
those
household
duties
which
take
up
so
much
of
the
time
of
your
mother
and
which
worry
your
father
when
he
comes
home
from
his
office
the
greeks
who
understood
the
value
of
leisure
had
reduced
such
duties
to
the
smallest
possible
minimum
by
living
amidst
surroundings
of
extreme
simplicity
to
begin
with
their
homes
were
very
plain
even
the
rich
nobles
spent
their
lives
in
a
sort
of
adobe
barn
which
lacked
all
the
comforts
which
a
modern
workman
expects
as
his
natural
right
a
greek
home
consisted
of
four
walls
and
a
roof
there
was
a
door
which
led
into
the
street
but
there
were
no
windows
the
kitchen
the
living
rooms
and
the
sleeping
quarters
were
built
around
an
open
courtyard
in
which
there
was
a
small
fountain
or
a
statue
and
a
few
plants
to
make
it
look
bright
within
this
courtyard
the
family
lived
when
it
did
not
rain
or
when
it
was
not
too
cold
in
one
corner
of
the
yard
the
cook
who
was
a
slave
prepared
the
meal
and
in
another
corner
the
teacher
who
was
also
a
slave
taught
the
children
the
alpha
beta
gamma
and
the
tables
of
multiplication
and
in
still
another
corner
the
lady
of
the
house
who
rarely
left
her
domain
since
it
was
not
considered
good
form
for
a
married
woman
to
be
seen
on
the
street
too
often
was
repairing
her
husband
coat
with
her
seamstresses
who
were
slaves
and
in
the
little
office
right
off
the
door
the
master
was
inspecting
the
accounts
which
the
overseer
of
his
farm
who
was
a
slave
had
just
brought
to
him
when
dinner
was
ready
the
family
came
together
but
the
meal
was
a
very
simple
one
and
did
not
take
much
time
the
greeks
seem
to
have
regarded
eating
as
an
unavoidable
evil
and
not
a
pastime
which
kills
many
dreary
hours
and
eventually
kills
many
dreary
people
they
lived
on
bread
and
on
wine
with
a
little
meat
and
some
green
vegetables
they
drank
water
only
when
nothing
else
was
available
because
they
did
not
think
it
very
healthy
they
loved
to
call
on
each
other
for
dinner
but
our
idea
of
a
festive
meal
where
everybody
is
supposed
to
eat
much
more
than
is
good
for
him
would
have
disgusted
them
they
came
together
at
the
table
for
the
purpose
of
a
good
talk
and
a
good
glass
of
wine
and
water
but
as
they
were
moderate
people
they
despised
those
who
drank
too
much
the
same
simplicity
which
prevailed
in
the
dining
room
also
dominated
their
choice
of
clothes
they
liked
to
be
clean
and
well
groomed
to
have
their
hair
and
beards
neatly
cut
to
feel
their
bodies
strong
with
the
exercise
and
the
swimming
of
the
gymnasium
but
they
never
followed
the
asiatic
fashion
which
prescribed
loud
colours
and
strange
patterns
they
wore
a
long
white
coat
and
they
managed
to
look
as
smart
as
a
modern
italian
officer
in
his
long
blue
cape
they
loved
to
see
their
wives
wear
ornaments
but
they
thought
it
very
vulgar
to
display
their
wealth
or
their
wives
in
public
and
whenever
the
women
left
their
home
they
were
as
inconspicuous
as
possible
in
short
the
story
of
greek
life
is
a
story
not
only
of
moderation
but
also
of
simplicity
things
chairs
and
tables
and
books
and
houses
and
carriages
are
apt
to
take
up
a
great
deal
of
their
owner
time
in
the
end
they
invariably
make
him
their
slave
and
his
hours
are
spent
looking
after
their
wants
keeping
them
polished
and
brushed
and
painted
the
greeks
before
everything
else
wanted
to
be
free
both
in
mind
and
in
body
that
they
might
maintain
their
liberty
and
be
truly
free
in
spirit
they
reduced
their
daily
needs
to
the
lowest
possible
point
the
greek
theatre
the
origins
of
the
theatre
the
first
form
of
public
amusement
at
a
very
early
stage
of
their
history
the
greeks
had
begun
to
collect
the
poems
which
had
been
written
in
honor
of
their
brave
ancestors
who
had
driven
the
pelasgians
out
of
hellas
and
had
destroyed
the
power
of
troy
these
poems
were
recited
in
public
and
everybody
came
to
listen
to
them
but
the
theatre
the
form
of
entertainment
which
has
become
almost
a
necessary
part
of
our
own
lives
did
not
grow
out
of
these
recited
heroic
tales
it
had
such
a
curious
origin
that
i
must
tell
you
something
about
it
in
a
separate
chapter
the
greeks
had
always
been
fond
of
parades
every
year
they
held
solemn
processions
in
honor
of
dionysos
the
god
of
the
wine
as
everybody
in
greece
drank
wine
the
greeks
thought
water
only
useful
for
the
purpose
of
swimming
and
sailing
this
particular
divinity
was
as
popular
as
a
god
of
the
would
be
in
our
own
land
and
because
the
was
supposed
to
live
in
the
vineyards
amidst
a
merry
mob
of
satyrs
strange
creatures
who
were
half
man
and
half
goat
the
crowd
that
joined
the
procession
used
to
wear
and
to
like
real
the
greek
word
for
goat
is
tragos
and
the
greek
word
for
singer
is
oidos
the
singer
who
like
a
goat
therefore
was
called
a
or
goat
singer
and
it
is
this
strange
name
which
developed
into
the
modern
word
tragedy
which
means
in
the
theatrical
sense
a
piece
with
an
unhappy
ending
just
as
comedy
which
really
means
the
singing
of
something
comos
or
gay
is
the
name
given
to
a
play
which
ends
happily
but
how
you
will
ask
did
this
noisy
chorus
of
masqueraders
stamping
around
like
wild
goats
ever
develop
into
the
noble
tragedies
which
have
filled
the
theatres
of
the
world
for
almost
two
thousand
years
the
connecting
link
between
the
and
hamlet
is
really
very
simple
as
i
shall
show
you
in
a
moment
the
singing
chorus
was
very
amusing
in
the
beginning
and
attracted
large
crowds
of
spectators
who
stood
along
the
side
of
the
road
and
laughed
but
soon
this
business
of
grew
tiresome
and
the
greeks
thought
dullness
an
evil
only
comparable
to
ugliness
or
sickness
they
asked
for
something
more
entertaining
then
an
inventive
young
poet
from
the
village
of
icaria
in
attica
hit
upon
a
new
idea
which
proved
a
tremendous
success
he
made
one
of
the
members
of
the
step
forward
and
engage
in
conversation
with
the
leader
of
the
musicians
who
marched
at
the
head
of
the
parade
playing
upon
their
pipes
of
pan
this
individual
was
allowed
to
step
out
of
line
he
waved
his
arms
and
gesticulated
while
he
spoke
that
is
to
say
he
acted
while
the
others
merely
stood
by
and
sang
and
he
asked
a
lot
of
questions
which
the
bandmaster
answered
according
to
the
roll
of
papyrus
upon
which
the
poet
had
written
down
these
answers
before
the
show
began
this
rough
and
ready
conversation
the
dialogue
which
told
the
story
of
dionysos
or
one
of
the
other
gods
became
at
once
popular
with
the
crowd
henceforth
every
dionysian
procession
had
an
acted
scene
and
very
soon
the
acting
was
considered
more
important
than
the
procession
and
the
aeschylus
the
most
successful
of
all
tragedians
who
wrote
no
less
than
eighty
plays
during
his
long
life
from
to
made
a
bold
step
forward
when
he
introduced
two
actors
instead
of
one
a
generation
later
sophocles
increased
the
number
of
actors
to
three
when
euripides
began
to
write
his
terrible
tragedies
in
the
middle
of
the
fifth
century
he
was
allowed
as
many
actors
as
he
liked
and
when
aristophanes
wrote
those
famous
comedies
in
which
he
poked
fun
at
everybody
and
everything
including
the
gods
of
mount
olympus
the
chorus
had
been
reduced
to
the
role
of
mere
bystanders
who
were
lined
up
behind
the
principal
performers
and
who
sang
this
is
a
terrible
world
while
the
hero
in
the
foreground
committed
a
crime
against
the
will
of
the
gods
this
new
form
of
dramatic
entertainment
demanded
a
proper
setting
and
soon
every
greek
city
owned
a
theatre
cut
out
of
the
rock
of
a
nearby
hill
the
spectators
sat
upon
wooden
benches
and
faced
a
wide
circle
our
present
orchestra
where
you
pay
three
dollars
and
thirty
cents
for
a
seat
upon
this
which
was
the
stage
the
actors
and
the
chorus
took
their
stand
behind
them
there
was
a
tent
where
they
made
up
with
large
clay
masks
which
hid
their
faces
and
which
showed
the
spectators
whether
the
actors
were
supposed
to
be
happy
and
smiling
or
unhappy
and
weeping
the
greek
word
for
tent
is
skene
and
that
is
the
reason
why
we
talk
of
the
scenery
of
the
stage
when
once
the
tragedy
had
become
part
of
greek
life
the
people
took
it
very
seriously
and
never
went
to
the
theatre
to
give
their
minds
a
vacation
a
new
play
became
as
important
an
event
as
an
election
and
a
successful
playwright
was
received
with
greater
honors
than
those
bestowed
upon
a
general
who
had
just
returned
from
a
famous
victory
the
persian
wars
how
the
greeks
defended
europe
against
asiatic
invasion
and
drove
the
persians
back
across
the
aegean
sea
the
greeks
had
learned
the
art
of
trading
from
the
aegeans
who
had
been
the
pupils
of
the
phoenicians
they
had
founded
colonies
after
the
phoenician
pattern
they
had
even
improved
upon
the
phoenician
methods
by
a
more
general
use
of
money
in
dealing
with
foreign
customers
in
the
sixth
century
before
our
era
they
had
established
themselves
firmly
along
the
coast
of
asia
minor
and
they
were
taking
away
trade
from
the
phoenicians
at
a
fast
rate
this
the
phoenicians
of
course
did
not
like
but
they
were
not
strong
enough
to
risk
a
war
with
their
greek
competitors
they
sat
and
waited
nor
did
they
wait
in
vain
in
a
former
chapter
i
have
told
you
how
a
humble
tribe
of
persian
shepherds
had
suddenly
gone
upon
the
warpath
and
had
conquered
the
greater
part
of
western
asia
the
persians
were
too
civilised
to
plunder
their
new
subjects
they
contented
themselves
with
a
yearly
tribute
when
they
reached
the
coast
of
asia
minor
they
insisted
that
the
greek
colonies
of
lydia
recognize
the
persian
kings
as
their
and
pay
them
a
stipulated
tax
the
greek
colonies
objected
the
persians
insisted
then
the
greek
colonies
appealed
to
the
and
the
stage
was
set
for
a
quarrel
for
if
the
truth
be
told
the
persian
kings
regarded
the
greek
as
very
dangerous
political
institutions
and
bad
examples
for
all
other
people
who
were
supposed
to
be
the
patient
slaves
of
the
mighty
persian
kings
of
course
the
greeks
enjoyed
a
certain
degree
of
safety
because
their
country
lay
hidden
beyond
the
deep
waters
of
the
aegean
but
here
their
old
enemies
the
phoenicians
stepped
forward
with
offers
of
help
and
advice
to
the
persians
if
the
persian
king
would
provide
the
soldiers
the
phoenicians
would
guarantee
to
deliver
the
necessary
ships
to
carry
them
to
europe
it
was
the
year
before
the
birth
of
christ
and
asia
made
ready
to
destroy
the
rising
power
of
europe
as
a
final
warning
the
king
of
persia
sent
messengers
to
the
greeks
asking
for
earth
and
water
as
a
token
of
their
submission
the
greeks
promptly
threw
the
messengers
into
the
nearest
well
where
they
would
find
both
earth
and
water
in
large
abundance
and
thereafter
of
course
peace
was
impossible
but
the
gods
of
high
olympus
watched
over
their
children
and
when
the
phoenician
fleet
carrying
the
persian
troops
was
near
mount
athos
the
blew
his
cheeks
until
he
almost
burst
the
veins
of
his
brow
and
the
fleet
was
destroyed
by
a
terrible
hurricane
and
the
persians
were
all
drowned
two
years
later
they
returned
this
time
they
sailed
straight
across
the
aegean
sea
and
landed
near
the
village
of
marathon
as
soon
as
the
athenians
heard
this
they
sent
their
army
of
ten
thousand
men
to
guard
the
hills
that
surrounded
the
marathonian
plain
at
the
same
time
they
despatched
a
fast
runner
to
sparta
to
ask
for
help
but
sparta
was
envious
of
the
fame
of
athens
and
refused
to
come
to
her
assistance
the
other
greek
cities
followed
her
example
with
the
exception
of
tiny
plataea
which
sent
a
thousand
men
on
the
twelfth
of
september
of
the
year
miltiades
the
athenian
commander
threw
this
little
army
against
the
hordes
of
the
persians
the
greeks
broke
through
the
persian
barrage
of
arrows
and
their
spears
caused
terrible
havoc
among
the
disorganised
asiatic
troops
who
had
never
been
called
upon
to
resist
such
an
enemy
that
night
the
people
of
athens
watched
the
sky
grow
red
with
the
flames
of
burning
ships
anxiously
they
waited
for
news
at
last
a
little
cloud
of
dust
appeared
upon
the
road
that
led
to
the
north
it
was
pheidippides
the
runner
he
stumbled
and
gasped
for
his
end
was
near
only
a
few
days
before
had
he
returned
from
his
errand
to
sparta
he
had
hastened
to
join
miltiades
that
morning
he
had
taken
part
in
the
attack
and
later
he
had
volunteered
to
carry
the
news
of
victory
to
his
beloved
city
the
people
saw
him
fall
and
they
rushed
forward
to
support
him
we
have
won
he
whispered
and
then
he
died
a
glorious
death
which
made
him
envied
of
all
men
as
for
the
persians
they
tried
after
this
defeat
to
land
near
athens
but
they
found
the
coast
guarded
and
disappeared
and
once
more
the
land
of
hellas
was
at
peace
eight
years
they
waited
and
during
this
time
the
greeks
were
not
idle
they
knew
that
a
final
attack
was
to
be
expected
but
they
did
not
agree
upon
the
best
way
to
avert
the
danger
some
people
wanted
to
increase
the
army
others
said
that
a
strong
fleet
was
necessary
for
success
the
two
parties
led
by
aristides
for
the
army
and
themistocles
the
leader
of
the
men
fought
each
other
bitterly
and
nothing
was
done
until
aristides
was
exiled
then
themistocles
had
his
chance
and
he
built
all
the
ships
he
could
and
turned
the
piraeus
into
a
strong
naval
base
in
the
year
a
tremendous
persian
army
appeared
in
thessaly
a
province
of
northern
greece
in
this
hour
of
danger
sparta
the
great
military
city
of
greece
was
elected
but
the
spartans
cared
little
what
happened
to
northern
greece
provided
their
own
country
was
not
invaded
they
neglected
to
fortify
the
passes
that
led
into
greece
a
small
detachment
of
spartans
under
leonidas
had
been
told
to
guard
the
narrow
road
between
the
high
mountains
and
the
sea
which
connected
thessaly
with
the
southern
provinces
leonidas
obeyed
his
orders
he
fought
and
held
the
pass
with
unequalled
bravery
but
a
traitor
by
the
name
of
ephialtes
who
knew
the
little
byways
of
malis
guided
a
regiment
of
persians
through
the
hills
and
made
it
possible
for
them
to
attack
leonidas
in
the
rear
near
the
warm
wells
the
thermopylae
a
terrible
battle
was
fought
when
night
came
leonidas
and
his
faithful
soldiers
lay
dead
under
the
corpses
of
their
enemies
but
the
pass
had
been
lost
and
the
greater
part
of
greece
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
persians
they
marched
upon
athens
threw
the
garrison
from
the
rocks
of
the
acropolis
and
burned
the
city
the
people
fled
to
the
island
of
salamis
all
seemed
lost
but
on
the
of
september
of
the
year
themistocles
forced
the
persian
fleet
to
give
battle
within
the
narrow
straits
which
separated
the
island
of
salamis
from
the
mainland
and
within
a
few
hours
he
destroyed
three
quarters
of
the
persian
ships
in
this
way
the
victory
of
thermopylae
came
to
naught
xerxes
was
forced
to
retire
the
next
year
so
he
decreed
would
bring
a
final
decision
he
took
his
troops
to
thessaly
and
there
he
waited
for
spring
but
this
time
the
spartans
understood
the
seriousness
of
the
hour
they
left
the
safe
shelter
of
the
wall
which
they
had
built
across
the
isthmus
of
corinth
and
under
the
leadership
of
pausanias
they
marched
against
mardonius
the
persian
general
the
united
greeks
some
one
hundred
thousand
men
from
a
dozen
different
cities
attacked
the
three
hundred
men
of
the
enemy
near
plataea
once
more
the
heavy
greek
infantry
broke
through
the
persian
barrage
of
arrows
the
persians
were
defeated
as
they
had
been
at
marathon
and
this
time
they
left
for
good
by
a
strange
coincidence
the
same
day
that
the
greek
armies
won
their
victory
near
plataea
the
athenian
ships
destroyed
the
fleet
near
cape
mycale
in
asia
minor
thus
did
the
first
encounter
between
asia
and
europe
end
athens
had
covered
herself
with
glory
and
sparta
had
fought
bravely
and
well
if
these
two
cities
had
been
able
to
come
to
an
agreement
if
they
had
been
willing
to
forget
their
little
jealousies
they
might
have
become
the
leaders
of
a
strong
and
united
hellas
but
alas
they
allowed
the
hour
of
victory
and
enthusiasm
to
slip
by
and
the
same
opportunity
never
returned
athens
sparta
how
athens
and
sparta
fought
a
long
and
disastrous
war
for
the
leadership
of
greece
athens
and
sparta
were
both
greek
cities
and
their
people
spoke
a
common
language
in
every
other
respect
they
were
different
athens
rose
high
from
the
plain
it
was
a
city
exposed
to
the
fresh
breezes
from
the
sea
willing
to
look
at
the
world
with
the
eyes
of
a
happy
child
sparta
on
the
other
hand
was
built
at
the
bottom
of
a
deep
valley
and
used
the
surrounding
mountains
as
a
barrier
against
foreign
thought
athens
was
a
city
of
busy
trade
sparta
was
an
armed
camp
where
people
were
soldiers
for
the
sake
of
being
soldiers
the
people
of
athens
loved
to
sit
in
the
sun
and
discuss
poetry
or
listen
to
the
wise
words
of
a
philosopher
the
spartans
on
the
other
hand
never
wrote
a
single
line
that
was
considered
literature
but
they
knew
how
to
fight
they
liked
to
fight
and
they
sacrificed
all
human
emotions
to
their
ideal
of
military
preparedness
no
wonder
that
these
sombre
spartans
viewed
the
success
of
athens
with
malicious
hate
the
energy
which
the
defence
of
the
common
home
had
developed
in
athens
was
now
used
for
purposes
of
a
more
peaceful
nature
the
acropolis
was
rebuilt
and
was
made
into
a
marble
shrine
to
the
goddess
athena
pericles
the
leader
of
the
athenian
democracy
sent
far
and
wide
to
find
famous
sculptors
and
painters
and
scientists
to
make
the
city
more
beautiful
and
the
young
athenians
more
worthy
of
their
home
at
the
same
time
he
kept
a
watchful
eye
on
sparta
and
built
high
walls
which
connected
athens
with
the
sea
and
made
her
the
strongest
fortress
of
that
day
an
insignificant
quarrel
between
two
little
greek
cities
led
to
the
final
conflict
for
thirty
years
the
war
between
athens
and
sparta
continued
it
ended
in
a
terrible
disaster
for
athens
during
the
third
year
of
the
war
the
plague
had
entered
the
city
more
than
half
of
the
people
and
pericles
the
great
leader
had
been
killed
the
plague
was
followed
by
a
period
of
bad
and
untrustworthy
leadership
a
brilliant
young
fellow
by
the
name
of
alcibiades
had
gained
the
favor
of
the
popular
assembly
he
suggested
a
raid
upon
the
spartan
colony
of
syracuse
in
sicily
an
expedition
was
equipped
and
everything
was
ready
but
alcibiades
got
mixed
up
in
a
street
brawl
and
was
forced
to
flee
the
general
who
succeeded
him
was
a
bungler
first
he
lost
his
ships
and
then
he
lost
his
army
and
the
few
surviving
athenians
were
thrown
into
the
of
syracuse
where
they
died
from
hunger
and
thirst
the
expedition
had
killed
all
the
young
men
of
athens
the
city
was
doomed
after
a
long
siege
the
town
surrendered
in
april
of
the
year
the
high
walls
were
demolished
the
navy
was
taken
away
by
the
spartans
athens
ceased
to
exist
as
the
center
of
the
great
colonial
empire
which
it
had
conquered
during
the
days
of
its
prosperity
but
that
wonderful
desire
to
learn
and
to
know
and
to
investigate
which
had
distinguished
her
free
citizens
during
the
days
of
greatness
and
prosperity
did
not
perish
with
the
walls
and
the
ships
it
continued
to
live
it
became
even
more
brilliant
athens
no
longer
shaped
the
destinies
of
the
land
of
greece
but
now
as
the
home
of
the
first
great
university
the
city
began
to
influence
the
minds
of
intelligent
people
far
beyond
the
narrow
frontiers
of
hellas
alexander
the
great
alexander
the
macedonian
establishes
a
greek
and
what
became
of
this
high
ambition
when
the
achaeans
had
left
their
homes
along
the
banks
of
the
danube
to
look
for
pastures
new
they
had
spent
some
time
among
the
mountains
of
macedonia
ever
since
the
greeks
had
maintained
certain
more
or
less
formal
relations
with
the
people
of
this
northern
country
the
macedonians
from
their
side
had
kept
themselves
well
informed
about
conditions
in
greece
now
it
happened
just
when
sparta
and
athens
had
finished
their
disastrous
war
for
the
leadership
of
hellas
that
macedonia
was
ruled
by
an
extraordinarily
clever
man
by
the
name
of
philip
he
admired
the
greek
spirit
in
letters
and
art
but
he
despised
the
greek
lack
of
in
political
affairs
it
irritated
him
to
see
a
perfectly
good
people
waste
its
men
and
money
upon
fruitless
quarrels
so
he
settled
the
difficulty
by
making
himself
the
master
of
all
greece
and
then
he
asked
his
new
subjects
to
join
him
on
a
voyage
which
he
meant
to
pay
to
persia
in
return
for
the
visit
which
xerxes
had
paid
the
greeks
one
hundred
and
fifty
years
before
unfortunately
philip
was
murdered
before
he
could
start
upon
this
expedition
the
task
of
avenging
the
destruction
of
athens
was
left
to
philip
son
alexander
the
beloved
pupil
of
aristotle
wisest
of
all
greek
teachers
alexander
bade
farewell
to
europe
in
the
spring
of
the
year
seven
years
later
he
reached
india
in
the
meantime
he
had
destroyed
phoenicia
the
old
rival
of
the
greek
merchants
he
had
conquered
egypt
and
had
been
worshipped
by
the
people
of
the
nile
valley
as
the
son
and
heir
of
the
pharaohs
he
had
defeated
the
last
persian
king
he
had
overthrown
the
persian
empire
he
had
given
orders
to
rebuild
babylon
he
had
led
his
troops
into
the
heart
of
the
himalayan
mountains
and
had
made
the
entire
world
a
macedonian
province
and
dependency
then
he
stopped
and
announced
even
more
ambitious
plans
the
newly
formed
empire
must
be
brought
under
the
influence
of
the
greek
mind
the
people
must
be
taught
the
greek
language
they
must
live
in
cities
built
after
a
greek
model
the
alexandrian
soldier
now
turned
the
military
camps
of
yesterday
became
the
peaceful
centres
of
the
newly
imported
greek
civilisation
higher
and
higher
did
the
flood
of
greek
manners
and
greek
customs
rise
when
suddenly
alexander
was
stricken
with
a
fever
and
died
in
the
old
palace
of
king
hammurabi
of
babylon
in
the
year
then
the
waters
receded
but
they
left
behind
the
fertile
clay
of
a
higher
civilisation
and
alexander
with
all
his
childish
ambitions
and
his
silly
vanities
had
performed
a
most
valuable
service
his
empire
did
not
long
survive
him
a
number
of
ambitious
generals
divided
the
territory
among
themselves
but
they
too
remained
faithful
to
the
dream
of
a
great
world
brotherhood
of
greek
and
asiatic
ideas
and
knowledge
they
maintained
their
independence
until
the
romans
added
western
asia
and
egypt
to
their
other
domains
the
strange
inheritance
of
this
hellenistic
civilisation
part
greek
part
persian
part
egyptian
and
babylonian
fell
to
the
roman
conquerors
during
the
following
centuries
it
got
such
a
firm
hold
upon
the
roman
world
that
we
feel
its
influence
in
our
own
lives
this
very
day
a
summary
a
short
summary
of
chapters
to
thus
far
from
the
top
of
our
high
tower
we
have
been
looking
eastward
but
from
this
time
on
the
history
of
egypt
and
mesopotamia
is
going
to
grow
less
interesting
and
i
must
take
you
to
study
the
western
landscape
before
we
do
this
let
us
stop
a
moment
and
make
clear
to
ourselves
what
we
have
seen
first
of
all
i
showed
you
prehistoric
man
a
creature
very
simple
in
his
habits
and
very
unattractive
in
his
manners
i
told
you
how
he
was
the
most
defenceless
of
the
many
animals
that
roamed
through
the
early
wilderness
of
the
five
continents
but
being
possessed
of
a
larger
and
better
brain
he
managed
to
hold
his
own
then
came
the
glaciers
and
the
many
centuries
of
cold
weather
and
life
on
this
planet
became
so
difficult
that
man
was
obliged
to
think
three
times
as
hard
as
ever
before
if
he
wished
to
survive
since
however
that
wish
to
survive
was
and
is
the
mainspring
which
keeps
every
living
being
going
full
tilt
to
the
last
gasp
of
its
breath
the
brain
of
glacial
man
was
set
to
work
in
all
earnestness
not
only
did
these
hardy
people
manage
to
exist
through
the
long
cold
spells
which
killed
many
ferocious
animals
but
when
the
earth
became
warm
and
comfortable
once
more
prehistoric
man
had
learned
a
number
of
things
which
gave
him
such
great
advantages
over
his
less
intelligent
neighbors
that
the
danger
of
extinction
a
very
serious
one
during
the
first
half
million
years
of
man
residence
upon
this
planet
became
a
very
remote
one
i
told
you
how
these
earliest
ancestors
of
ours
were
slowly
plodding
along
when
suddenly
and
for
reasons
that
are
not
well
understood
the
people
who
lived
in
the
valley
of
the
nile
rushed
ahead
and
almost
over
night
created
the
first
centre
of
civilisation
then
i
showed
you
mesopotamia
the
land
between
the
rivers
which
was
the
second
great
school
of
the
human
race
and
i
made
you
a
map
of
the
little
island
bridges
of
the
aegean
sea
which
carried
the
knowledge
and
the
science
of
the
old
east
to
the
young
west
where
lived
the
greeks
next
i
told
you
of
an
tribe
called
the
hellenes
who
thousands
of
years
before
had
left
the
heart
of
asia
and
who
had
in
the
eleventh
century
before
our
era
pushed
their
way
into
the
rocky
peninsula
of
greece
and
who
since
then
have
been
known
to
us
as
the
greeks
and
i
told
you
the
story
of
the
little
greek
cities
that
were
really
states
where
the
civilisation
of
old
egypt
and
asia
was
transfigured
that
is
a
big
word
but
you
can
figure
out
what
it
means
into
something
quite
new
something
that
was
much
nobler
and
finer
than
anything
that
had
gone
before
when
you
look
at
the
map
you
will
see
how
by
this
time
civilisation
has
described
a
it
begins
in
egypt
and
by
way
of
mesopotamia
and
the
aegean
islands
it
moves
westward
until
it
reaches
the
european
continent
the
first
four
thousand
years
egyptians
and
babylonians
and
phoenicians
and
a
large
number
of
semitic
tribes
please
remember
that
the
jews
were
but
one
of
a
large
number
of
semitic
peoples
have
carried
the
torch
that
was
to
illuminate
the
world
they
now
hand
it
over
to
the
greeks
who
become
the
teachers
of
another
tribe
called
the
romans
but
meanwhile
the
semites
have
pushed
westward
along
the
northern
coast
of
africa
and
have
made
themselves
the
rulers
of
the
western
half
of
the
mediterranean
just
when
the
eastern
half
has
become
a
greek
or
possession
this
as
you
shall
see
in
a
moment
leads
to
a
terrible
conflict
between
the
two
rival
races
and
out
of
their
struggle
arises
the
victorious
roman
empire
which
is
to
take
this
civilisation
to
the
furthermost
corners
of
the
european
continent
where
it
serves
as
the
foundation
upon
which
our
modern
society
is
based
i
know
all
this
sounds
very
complicated
but
if
you
get
hold
of
these
few
principles
the
rest
of
our
history
will
become
a
great
deal
simpler
the
maps
will
make
clear
what
the
words
fail
to
tell
and
after
this
short
intermission
we
go
back
to
our
story
and
give
you
an
account
of
the
famous
war
between
carthage
and
rome
rome
and
carthage
the
semitic
colony
of
carthage
on
the
northern
coast
of
africa
and
the
city
of
rome
on
the
west
coast
of
italy
fought
each
other
for
the
possession
of
the
western
mediterranean
and
carthage
was
destroyed
the
little
phoenician
trading
post
of
stood
on
a
low
hill
which
overlooked
the
african
sea
a
stretch
of
water
ninety
miles
wide
which
separates
africa
from
europe
it
was
an
ideal
spot
for
a
commercial
centre
almost
too
ideal
it
grew
too
fast
and
became
too
rich
when
in
the
sixth
century
before
our
era
nebuchadnezzar
of
babylon
destroyed
tyre
carthage
broke
off
all
further
relations
with
the
mother
country
and
became
an
independent
state
the
great
western
of
the
semitic
races
unfortunately
the
city
had
inherited
many
of
the
traits
which
for
a
thousand
years
had
been
characteristic
of
the
phoenicians
it
was
a
vast
protected
by
a
strong
navy
indifferent
to
most
of
the
finer
aspects
of
life
the
city
and
the
surrounding
country
and
the
distant
colonies
were
all
ruled
by
a
small
but
exceedingly
powerful
group
of
rich
men
the
greek
word
for
rich
is
ploutos
and
the
greeks
called
such
a
government
by
rich
men
a
plutocracy
carthage
was
a
plutocracy
and
the
real
power
of
the
state
lay
in
the
hands
of
a
dozen
big
and
and
merchants
who
met
in
the
back
room
of
an
office
and
regarded
their
common
fatherland
as
a
business
enterprise
which
ought
to
yield
them
a
decent
profit
they
were
however
wide
awake
and
full
of
energy
and
worked
very
hard
as
the
years
went
by
the
influence
of
carthage
upon
her
neighbours
increased
until
the
greater
part
of
the
african
coast
spain
and
certain
regions
of
france
were
carthaginian
possessions
and
paid
tribute
taxes
and
dividends
to
the
mighty
city
on
the
african
sea
of
course
such
a
plutocracy
was
forever
at
the
mercy
of
the
crowd
as
long
as
there
was
plenty
of
work
and
wages
were
high
the
majority
of
the
citizens
were
quite
contented
allowed
their
betters
to
rule
them
and
asked
no
embarrassing
questions
but
when
no
ships
left
the
harbor
when
no
ore
was
brought
to
the
when
dockworkers
and
stevedores
were
thrown
out
of
employment
then
there
were
grumblings
and
there
was
a
demand
that
the
popular
assembly
be
called
together
as
in
the
olden
days
when
carthage
had
been
a
republic
to
prevent
such
an
occurrence
the
plutocracy
was
obliged
to
keep
the
business
of
the
town
going
at
full
speed
they
had
managed
to
do
this
very
successfully
for
almost
five
years
when
they
were
greatly
disturbed
by
certain
rumors
which
reached
them
from
the
western
coast
of
italy
it
was
said
that
a
little
village
on
the
banks
of
the
tiber
had
suddenly
risen
to
great
power
and
was
making
itself
the
acknowledged
leader
of
all
the
latin
tribes
who
inhabited
central
italy
it
was
also
said
that
this
village
which
by
the
way
was
called
rome
intended
to
build
ships
and
go
after
the
commerce
of
sicily
and
the
southern
coast
of
france
carthage
could
not
possibly
tolerate
such
competition
the
young
rival
must
be
destroyed
lest
the
carthaginian
rulers
lose
their
prestige
as
the
absolute
rulers
of
the
western
mediterranean
the
rumors
were
duly
investigated
and
in
a
general
way
these
were
the
facts
that
came
to
light
the
west
coast
of
italy
had
long
been
neglected
by
civilisation
whereas
in
greece
all
the
good
harbours
faced
eastward
and
enjoyed
a
full
view
of
the
busy
islands
of
the
aegean
the
west
coast
of
italy
contemplated
nothing
more
exciting
than
the
desolate
waves
of
the
mediterranean
the
country
was
poor
it
was
therefore
rarely
visited
by
foreign
merchants
and
the
natives
were
allowed
to
live
in
undisturbed
possession
of
their
hills
and
their
marshy
plains
the
first
serious
invasion
of
this
land
came
from
the
north
at
an
unknown
date
certain
tribes
had
managed
to
find
their
way
through
the
passes
of
the
alps
and
had
pushed
southward
until
they
had
filled
the
heel
and
the
toe
of
the
famous
italian
boot
with
their
villages
and
their
flocks
of
these
early
conquerors
we
know
nothing
no
homer
sang
their
glory
their
own
accounts
of
the
foundation
of
rome
written
eight
hundred
years
later
when
the
little
city
had
become
the
centre
of
an
empire
are
fairy
stories
and
do
not
belong
in
a
history
romulus
and
remus
jumping
across
each
other
walls
i
always
forget
who
jumped
across
whose
wall
make
entertaining
reading
but
the
foundation
of
the
city
of
rome
was
a
much
more
prosaic
affair
rome
began
as
a
thousand
american
cities
have
done
by
being
a
convenient
place
for
barter
and
it
lay
in
the
heart
of
the
plains
of
central
italy
the
tiber
provided
direct
access
to
the
sea
the
from
north
to
south
found
here
a
convenient
ford
which
could
be
used
all
the
year
around
and
seven
little
hills
along
the
banks
of
the
river
offered
the
inhabitants
a
safe
shelter
against
their
enemies
who
lived
in
the
mountains
and
those
who
lived
beyond
the
horizon
of
the
nearby
sea
the
mountaineers
were
called
the
sabines
they
were
a
rough
crowd
with
an
unholy
desire
for
easy
plunder
but
they
were
very
backward
they
used
stone
axes
and
wooden
shields
and
were
no
match
for
the
romans
with
their
steel
swords
the
on
the
other
hand
were
dangerous
foes
they
were
called
the
etruscans
and
they
were
and
still
are
one
of
the
great
mysteries
of
history
nobody
knew
or
knows
whence
they
came
who
they
were
what
had
driven
them
away
from
their
original
homes
we
have
found
the
remains
of
their
cities
and
their
cemeteries
and
their
waterworks
all
along
the
italian
coast
we
are
familiar
with
their
inscriptions
but
as
no
one
has
ever
been
able
to
decipher
the
etruscan
alphabet
these
written
messages
are
so
far
merely
annoying
and
not
at
all
useful
our
best
guess
is
that
the
etruscans
came
originally
from
asia
minor
and
that
a
great
war
or
a
pestilence
in
that
country
had
forced
them
to
go
away
and
seek
a
new
home
elsewhere
whatever
the
reason
for
their
coming
the
etruscans
played
a
great
role
in
history
they
carried
the
pollen
of
the
ancient
civilisation
from
the
east
to
the
west
and
they
taught
the
romans
who
as
we
know
came
from
the
north
the
first
principles
of
architecture
and
and
fighting
and
art
and
cookery
and
medicine
and
astronomy
but
just
as
the
greeks
had
not
loved
their
aegean
teachers
in
this
same
way
did
the
romans
hate
their
etruscan
masters
they
got
rid
of
them
as
soon
as
they
could
and
the
opportunity
offered
itself
when
greek
merchants
discovered
the
commercial
possibilities
of
italy
and
when
the
first
greek
vessels
reached
rome
the
greeks
came
to
trade
but
they
stayed
to
instruct
they
found
the
tribes
who
inhabited
the
roman
and
who
were
called
the
latins
quite
willing
to
learn
such
things
as
might
be
of
practical
use
at
once
they
understood
the
great
benefit
that
could
be
derived
from
a
written
alphabet
and
they
copied
that
of
the
greeks
they
also
understood
the
commercial
advantages
of
a
system
of
coins
and
measures
and
weights
eventually
the
romans
swallowed
greek
civilisation
hook
line
and
sinker
they
even
welcomed
the
gods
of
the
greeks
to
their
country
zeus
was
taken
to
rome
where
he
became
known
as
jupiter
and
the
other
divinities
followed
him
the
roman
gods
however
never
were
quite
like
their
cheerful
cousins
who
had
accompanied
the
greeks
on
their
road
through
life
and
through
history
the
roman
gods
were
state
functionaries
each
one
managed
his
own
department
with
great
prudence
and
a
deep
sense
of
justice
but
in
turn
he
was
exact
in
demanding
the
obedience
of
his
worshippers
this
obedience
the
romans
rendered
with
scrupulous
care
but
they
never
established
the
cordial
personal
relations
and
that
charming
friendship
which
had
existed
between
the
old
hellenes
and
the
mighty
residents
of
the
high
olympian
peak
the
romans
did
not
imitate
the
greek
form
of
government
but
being
of
the
same
stock
as
the
people
of
hellas
the
early
history
of
rome
resembles
that
of
athens
and
the
other
greek
cities
they
did
not
find
it
difficult
to
get
rid
of
their
kings
the
descendants
of
the
ancient
tribal
chieftains
but
once
the
kings
had
been
driven
from
the
city
the
romans
were
forced
to
bridle
the
power
of
the
nobles
and
it
took
many
centuries
before
they
managed
to
establish
a
system
which
gave
every
free
citizen
of
rome
a
chance
to
take
a
personal
interest
in
the
affairs
of
his
town
thereafter
the
romans
enjoyed
one
great
advantage
over
the
greeks
they
managed
the
affairs
of
their
country
without
making
too
many
speeches
they
were
less
imaginative
than
the
greeks
and
they
preferred
an
ounce
of
action
to
a
pound
of
words
they
understood
the
tendency
of
the
multitude
the
plebe
as
the
assemblage
of
free
citizens
was
called
only
too
well
to
waste
valuable
time
upon
mere
talk
they
therefore
placed
the
actual
business
of
running
the
city
into
the
hands
of
two
consuls
who
were
assisted
by
a
council
of
elders
called
the
senate
because
the
word
senex
means
an
old
man
as
a
matter
of
custom
and
practical
advantage
the
senators
were
elected
from
the
nobility
but
their
power
had
been
strictly
defined
rome
at
one
time
had
passed
through
the
same
sort
of
struggle
between
the
poor
and
the
rich
which
had
forced
athens
to
adopt
the
laws
of
draco
and
solon
in
rome
this
conflict
had
occurred
in
the
fifth
century
as
a
result
the
freemen
had
obtained
a
written
code
of
laws
which
protected
them
against
the
despotism
of
the
aristocratic
judges
by
the
institution
of
the
tribune
these
tribunes
were
elected
by
the
freemen
they
had
the
right
to
protect
any
citizen
against
those
actions
of
the
government
officials
which
were
thought
to
be
unjust
a
consul
had
the
right
to
condemn
a
man
to
death
but
if
the
case
had
not
been
absolutely
proved
the
tribune
could
interfere
and
save
the
poor
fellow
life
but
when
i
use
the
word
rome
i
seem
to
refer
to
a
little
city
of
a
few
thousand
inhabitants
and
the
real
strength
of
rome
lay
in
the
country
districts
outside
her
walls
and
it
was
in
the
government
of
these
outlying
provinces
that
rome
at
an
early
age
showed
her
wonderful
gift
as
a
colonising
power
in
very
early
times
rome
had
been
the
only
strongly
fortified
city
in
central
italy
but
it
had
always
offered
a
hospitable
refuge
to
other
latin
tribes
who
happened
to
be
in
danger
of
attack
the
latin
neighbours
had
recognised
the
advantages
of
a
close
union
with
such
a
powerful
friend
and
they
had
tried
to
find
a
basis
for
some
sort
of
defensive
and
offensive
alliance
other
nations
egyptians
babylonians
phoenicians
even
greeks
would
have
insisted
upon
a
treaty
of
submission
on
the
part
of
the
barbarians
the
romans
did
nothing
of
the
sort
they
gave
the
outsider
a
chance
to
become
partners
in
a
common
res
publica
or
you
want
to
join
us
they
said
very
well
go
ahead
and
join
we
shall
treat
you
as
if
you
were
citizens
of
rome
in
return
for
this
privilege
we
expect
you
to
fight
for
our
city
the
mother
of
us
all
whenever
it
shall
be
necessary
the
outsider
appreciated
this
generosity
and
he
showed
his
gratitude
by
his
unswerving
loyalty
whenever
a
greek
city
had
been
attacked
the
foreign
residents
had
moved
out
as
quickly
as
they
could
why
defend
something
which
meant
nothing
to
them
but
a
temporary
boarding
house
in
which
they
were
tolerated
as
long
as
they
paid
their
bills
but
when
the
enemy
was
before
the
gates
of
rome
all
the
latins
rushed
to
her
defence
it
was
their
mother
who
was
in
danger
it
was
their
true
home
even
if
they
lived
a
hundred
miles
away
and
had
never
seen
the
walls
of
the
sacred
hills
no
defeat
and
no
disaster
could
change
this
sentiment
in
the
beginning
of
the
fourth
century
the
wild
gauls
forced
their
way
into
italy
they
had
defeated
the
roman
army
near
the
river
allia
and
had
marched
upon
the
city
they
had
taken
rome
and
then
they
expected
that
the
people
would
come
and
sue
for
peace
they
waited
but
nothing
happened
after
a
short
time
the
gauls
found
themselves
surrounded
by
a
hostile
population
which
made
it
impossible
for
them
to
obtain
supplies
after
seven
months
hunger
forced
them
to
withdraw
the
policy
of
rome
to
treat
the
foreigner
on
equal
terms
had
proved
a
great
success
and
rome
stood
stronger
than
ever
before
this
short
account
of
the
early
history
of
rome
shows
you
the
enormous
difference
between
the
roman
ideal
of
a
healthy
state
and
that
of
the
ancient
world
which
was
embodied
in
the
town
of
carthage
the
romans
counted
upon
the
cheerful
and
hearty
between
a
number
of
equal
citizens
the
carthaginians
following
the
example
of
egypt
and
western
asia
insisted
upon
the
unreasoning
and
therefore
unwilling
obedience
of
subjects
and
when
these
failed
they
hired
professional
soldiers
to
do
their
fighting
for
them
you
will
now
understand
why
carthage
was
bound
to
fear
such
a
clever
and
powerful
enemy
and
why
the
plutocracy
of
carthage
was
only
too
willing
to
pick
a
quarrel
that
they
might
destroy
the
dangerous
rival
before
it
was
too
late
but
the
carthaginians
being
good
business
men
knew
that
it
never
pays
to
rush
matters
they
proposed
to
the
romans
that
their
respective
cities
draw
two
circles
on
the
map
and
that
each
town
claim
one
of
these
circles
as
her
own
sphere
of
influence
and
promise
to
keep
out
of
the
other
fellow
circle
the
agreement
was
promptly
made
and
was
broken
just
as
promptly
when
both
sides
thought
it
wise
to
send
their
armies
to
sicily
where
a
rich
soil
and
a
bad
government
invited
foreign
interference
the
war
which
followed
the
first
punic
war
lasted
years
it
was
fought
out
on
the
high
seas
and
in
the
beginning
it
seemed
that
the
experienced
carthaginian
navy
would
defeat
the
newly
created
roman
fleet
following
their
ancient
tactics
the
carthaginian
ships
would
either
ram
the
enemy
vessels
or
by
a
bold
attack
from
the
side
they
would
break
their
oars
and
would
then
kill
the
sailors
of
the
helpless
vessel
with
their
arrows
and
with
fire
balls
but
roman
engineers
invented
a
new
craft
which
carried
a
boarding
bridge
across
which
the
roman
infantrymen
stormed
the
hostile
ship
then
there
was
a
sudden
end
to
carthaginian
victories
at
the
battle
of
mylae
their
fleet
was
badly
defeated
carthage
was
obliged
to
sue
for
peace
and
sicily
became
part
of
the
roman
domains
years
later
new
trouble
arose
rome
in
quest
of
copper
had
taken
the
island
of
sardinia
carthage
in
quest
of
silver
thereupon
occupied
all
of
southern
spain
this
made
carthage
a
direct
neighbour
of
the
romans
the
latter
did
not
like
this
at
all
and
they
ordered
their
troops
to
cross
the
pyrenees
and
watch
the
carthaginian
army
of
occupation
the
stage
was
set
for
the
second
outbreak
between
the
two
rivals
once
more
a
greek
colony
was
the
pretext
for
a
war
the
carthaginians
were
besieging
saguntum
on
the
east
coast
of
spain
the
saguntians
appealed
to
rome
and
rome
as
usual
was
willing
to
help
the
senate
promised
the
help
of
the
latin
armies
but
the
preparation
for
this
expedition
took
some
time
and
meanwhile
saguntum
had
been
taken
and
had
been
destroyed
this
had
been
done
in
direct
opposition
to
the
will
of
rome
the
senate
decided
upon
war
one
roman
army
was
to
cross
the
african
sea
and
make
a
landing
on
carthaginian
soil
a
second
division
was
to
keep
the
carthaginian
armies
occupied
in
spain
to
prevent
them
from
rushing
to
the
aid
of
the
home
town
it
was
an
excellent
plan
and
everybody
expected
a
great
victory
but
the
gods
had
decided
otherwise
it
was
the
fall
of
the
year
before
the
birth
of
christ
and
the
roman
army
which
was
to
attack
the
carthaginians
in
spain
had
left
italy
people
were
eagerly
waiting
for
news
of
an
easy
and
complete
victory
when
a
terrible
rumour
began
to
spread
through
the
plain
of
the
po
wild
mountaineers
their
lips
trembling
with
fear
told
of
hundreds
of
thousands
of
brown
men
accompanied
by
strange
beasts
each
one
as
big
as
a
house
who
had
suddenly
emerged
from
the
clouds
of
snow
which
surrounded
the
old
graian
pass
through
which
hercules
thousands
of
years
before
had
driven
the
oxen
of
geryon
on
his
way
from
spain
to
greece
soon
an
endless
stream
of
bedraggled
refugees
appeared
before
the
gates
of
rome
with
more
complete
details
hannibal
the
son
of
hamilcar
with
fifty
thousand
soldiers
nine
thousand
horsemen
and
fighting
elephants
had
crossed
the
pyrenees
he
had
defeated
the
roman
army
of
scipio
on
the
banks
of
the
rhone
and
he
had
guided
his
army
safely
across
the
mountain
passes
of
the
alps
although
it
was
october
and
the
roads
were
thickly
covered
with
snow
and
ice
then
he
had
joined
forces
with
the
gauls
and
together
they
had
defeated
a
second
roman
army
just
before
they
crossed
the
trebia
and
laid
siege
to
placentia
the
northern
terminus
of
the
road
which
connected
rome
with
the
province
of
the
alpine
districts
the
senate
surprised
but
calm
and
energetic
as
usual
hushed
up
the
news
of
these
many
defeats
and
sent
two
fresh
armies
to
stop
the
invader
hannibal
managed
to
surprise
these
troops
on
a
narrow
road
along
the
shores
of
the
trasimene
lake
and
there
he
killed
all
the
roman
officers
and
most
of
their
men
this
time
there
was
a
panic
among
the
people
of
rome
but
the
senate
kept
its
nerve
a
third
army
was
organised
and
the
command
was
given
to
quintus
fabius
maximus
with
full
power
to
act
as
was
necessary
to
save
the
state
fabius
knew
that
he
must
be
very
careful
lest
all
be
lost
his
raw
and
untrained
men
the
last
available
soldiers
were
no
match
for
veterans
he
refused
to
accept
battle
but
forever
he
followed
hannibal
destroyed
everything
eatable
destroyed
the
roads
attacked
small
detachments
and
generally
weakened
the
morale
of
the
carthaginian
troops
by
a
most
distressing
and
annoying
form
of
guerilla
warfare
such
methods
however
did
not
satisfy
the
fearsome
crowds
who
had
found
safety
behind
the
walls
of
rome
they
wanted
action
something
must
be
done
and
must
be
done
quickly
a
popular
hero
by
the
name
of
varro
the
sort
of
man
who
went
about
the
city
telling
everybody
how
much
better
he
could
do
things
than
slow
old
fabius
the
delayer
was
made
by
popular
acclamation
at
the
battle
of
cannae
he
suffered
the
most
terrible
defeat
of
roman
history
more
than
seventy
thousand
men
were
killed
hannibal
was
master
of
all
italy
he
marched
from
one
end
of
the
peninsula
to
the
other
proclaiming
himself
the
deliverer
from
the
yoke
of
rome
and
asking
the
different
provinces
to
join
him
in
warfare
upon
the
mother
city
then
once
more
the
wisdom
of
rome
bore
noble
fruit
with
the
exceptions
of
capua
and
syracuse
all
roman
cities
remained
loyal
hannibal
the
deliverer
found
himself
opposed
by
the
people
whose
friend
he
pretended
to
be
he
was
far
away
from
home
and
did
not
like
the
situation
he
sent
messengers
to
carthage
to
ask
for
fresh
supplies
and
new
men
alas
carthage
could
not
send
him
either
the
romans
with
their
were
the
masters
of
the
sea
hannibal
must
help
himself
as
best
he
could
he
continued
to
defeat
the
roman
armies
that
were
sent
out
against
him
but
his
own
numbers
were
decreasing
rapidly
and
the
italian
peasants
held
aloof
from
this
deliverer
after
many
years
of
uninterrupted
victories
hannibal
found
himself
besieged
in
the
country
which
he
had
just
conquered
for
a
moment
the
luck
seemed
to
turn
hasdrubal
his
brother
had
defeated
the
roman
armies
in
spain
he
had
crossed
the
alps
to
come
to
assistance
he
sent
messengers
to
the
south
to
tell
of
his
arrival
and
ask
the
other
army
to
meet
him
in
the
plain
of
the
tiber
unfortunately
the
messengers
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
romans
and
hannibal
waited
in
vain
for
further
news
until
his
brother
head
neatly
packed
in
a
basket
came
rolling
into
his
camp
and
told
him
of
the
fate
of
the
last
of
the
carthaginian
troops
with
hasdrubal
out
of
the
way
young
publius
scipio
easily
reconquered
spain
and
four
years
later
the
romans
were
ready
for
a
final
attack
upon
carthage
hannibal
was
called
back
he
crossed
the
african
sea
and
tried
to
organise
the
defences
of
his
in
the
year
at
the
battle
of
zama
the
carthaginians
were
defeated
hannibal
fled
to
tyre
from
there
he
went
to
asia
minor
to
stir
up
the
syrians
and
the
macedonians
against
rome
he
accomplished
very
little
but
his
activities
among
these
asiatic
powers
gave
the
romans
an
excuse
to
carry
their
warfare
into
the
territory
of
the
east
and
annex
the
greater
part
of
the
aegean
world
driven
from
one
city
to
another
a
fugitive
without
a
home
hannibal
at
last
knew
that
the
end
of
his
ambitious
dream
had
come
his
beloved
city
of
carthage
had
been
ruined
by
the
war
she
had
been
forced
to
sign
a
terrible
peace
her
navy
had
been
sunk
she
had
been
forbidden
to
make
war
without
roman
permission
she
had
been
condemned
to
pay
the
romans
millions
of
dollars
for
endless
years
to
come
life
offered
no
hope
of
a
better
future
in
the
year
hannibal
took
poison
and
killed
himself
forty
years
later
the
romans
forced
their
last
war
upon
carthage
three
long
years
the
inhabitants
of
the
old
phoenician
colony
held
out
against
the
power
of
the
new
republic
hunger
forced
them
to
surrender
the
few
men
and
women
who
had
survived
the
siege
were
sold
as
slaves
the
city
was
set
on
fire
for
two
whole
weeks
the
and
the
and
the
great
arsenal
burned
then
a
terrible
curse
was
pronounced
upon
the
blackened
ruins
and
the
roman
legions
returned
to
italy
to
enjoy
their
victory
for
the
next
thousand
years
the
mediterranean
remained
a
european
sea
but
as
soon
as
the
roman
empire
had
been
destroyed
asia
made
another
attempt
to
dominate
this
great
inland
sea
as
you
will
learn
when
i
tell
you
about
mohammed
the
rise
of
rome
how
rome
happened
the
roman
empire
was
an
accident
no
one
planned
it
it
happened
no
famous
general
or
statesman
or
ever
got
up
and
said
friends
romans
citizens
we
must
found
an
empire
follow
me
and
together
we
shall
conquer
all
the
land
from
the
gates
of
hercules
to
mount
taurus
rome
produced
famous
generals
and
equally
distinguished
statesmen
and
and
roman
armies
fought
all
over
the
world
but
the
roman
was
done
without
a
preconceived
plan
the
average
roman
was
a
very
citizen
he
disliked
theories
about
government
when
someone
began
to
recite
eastward
the
course
of
roman
empire
he
hastily
left
the
forum
he
just
continued
to
take
more
and
more
land
because
circumstances
forced
him
to
do
so
he
was
not
driven
by
ambition
or
by
greed
both
by
nature
and
inclination
he
was
a
farmer
and
wanted
to
stay
at
home
but
when
he
was
attacked
he
was
obliged
to
defend
himself
and
when
the
enemy
happened
to
cross
the
sea
to
ask
for
aid
in
a
distant
country
then
the
patient
roman
marched
many
dreary
miles
to
defeat
this
dangerous
foe
and
when
this
had
been
accomplished
he
stayed
behind
to
adminster
sic
his
newly
conquered
provinces
lest
they
fall
into
the
hands
of
wandering
barbarians
and
become
themselves
a
menace
to
roman
safety
it
sounds
rather
complicated
and
yet
to
the
contemporaries
it
was
so
very
simple
as
you
shall
see
in
a
moment
in
the
year
scipio
had
crossed
the
african
sea
and
had
carried
the
war
into
africa
carthage
had
called
hannibal
back
badly
supported
by
his
mercenaries
hannibal
had
been
defeated
near
zama
the
romans
had
asked
for
his
surrender
and
hannibal
had
fled
to
get
aid
from
the
kings
of
macedonia
and
syria
as
i
told
you
in
my
last
chapter
the
rulers
of
these
two
countries
remnants
of
the
empire
of
alexander
the
great
just
then
were
contemplating
an
expedition
against
egypt
they
hoped
to
divide
the
rich
nile
valley
between
themselves
the
king
of
egypt
had
heard
of
this
and
he
had
asked
rome
to
come
to
his
support
the
stage
was
set
for
a
number
of
highly
interesting
plots
and
but
the
romans
with
their
lack
of
imagination
rang
the
curtain
down
before
the
play
had
been
fairly
started
their
legions
completely
defeated
the
heavy
greek
phalanx
which
was
still
used
by
the
macedonians
as
their
battle
formation
that
happened
in
the
year
at
the
battle
in
the
plains
of
cynoscephalae
or
dogs
heads
in
central
thessaly
the
romans
then
marched
southward
to
attica
and
informed
the
greeks
that
they
had
come
to
deliver
the
hellenes
from
the
macedonian
yoke
the
greeks
having
learned
nothing
in
their
years
of
used
their
new
freedom
in
a
most
unfortunate
way
all
the
little
once
more
began
to
quarrel
with
each
other
as
they
had
done
in
the
good
old
days
the
romans
who
had
little
understanding
and
less
love
for
these
silly
bickerings
of
a
race
which
they
rather
despised
showed
great
forebearance
but
tiring
of
these
endless
dissensions
they
lost
patience
invaded
greece
burned
down
corinth
to
encourage
the
other
greeks
and
sent
a
roman
governor
to
athens
to
rule
this
turbulent
province
in
this
way
macedonia
and
greece
became
buffer
states
which
protected
rome
eastern
frontier
meanwhile
right
across
the
hellespont
lay
the
kingdom
of
syria
and
antiochus
iii
who
ruled
that
vast
land
had
shown
great
eagerness
when
his
distinguished
guest
general
hannibal
explained
to
him
how
easy
it
would
be
to
invade
italy
and
sack
the
city
of
rome
lucius
scipio
a
brother
of
scipio
the
african
fighter
who
had
defeated
hannibal
and
his
carthaginians
at
zama
was
sent
to
asia
minor
he
destroyed
the
armies
of
the
syrian
king
near
magnesia
in
the
year
shortly
afterwards
antiochus
was
lynched
by
his
own
people
asia
minor
became
a
roman
protectorate
and
the
small
of
rome
was
mistress
of
most
of
the
lands
which
bordered
upon
the
mediterranean
the
roman
empire
how
the
republic
of
rome
after
centuries
of
unrest
and
revolution
became
an
empire
when
the
roman
armies
returned
from
these
many
victorious
campaigns
they
were
received
with
great
jubilation
alas
and
alack
this
sudden
glory
did
not
make
the
country
any
happier
on
the
contrary
the
endless
campaigns
had
ruined
the
farmers
who
had
been
obliged
to
do
the
hard
work
of
empire
making
it
had
placed
too
much
power
in
the
hands
of
the
successful
generals
and
their
private
friends
who
had
used
the
war
as
an
excuse
for
wholesale
robbery
the
old
roman
republic
had
been
proud
of
the
simplicity
which
had
characterised
the
lives
of
her
famous
men
the
new
republic
felt
ashamed
of
the
shabby
coats
and
the
high
principles
which
had
been
fashionable
in
the
days
of
its
grandfathers
it
became
a
land
of
rich
people
ruled
by
rich
people
for
the
benefit
of
rich
people
as
such
it
was
doomed
to
disastrous
failure
as
i
shall
now
tell
you
within
less
than
a
century
and
a
half
rome
had
become
the
mistress
of
practically
all
the
land
around
the
mediterranean
in
those
early
days
of
history
a
prisoner
of
war
lost
his
freedom
and
became
a
slave
the
roman
regarded
war
as
a
very
serious
business
and
he
showed
no
mercy
to
a
conquered
foe
after
the
fall
of
carthage
the
carthaginian
women
and
children
were
sold
into
bondage
together
with
their
own
slaves
and
a
like
fate
awaited
the
obstinate
inhabitants
of
greece
and
macedonia
and
spain
and
syria
when
they
dared
to
revolt
against
the
roman
power
two
thousand
years
ago
a
slave
was
merely
a
piece
of
machinery
nowadays
a
rich
man
invests
his
money
in
factories
the
rich
people
of
rome
senators
generals
and
invested
theirs
in
land
and
in
slaves
the
land
they
bought
or
took
in
the
provinces
the
slaves
they
bought
in
open
market
wherever
they
happened
to
be
cheapest
during
most
of
the
third
and
second
centuries
before
christ
there
was
a
plentiful
supply
and
as
a
result
the
landowners
worked
their
slaves
until
they
dropped
dead
in
their
tracks
when
they
bought
new
ones
at
the
nearest
of
corinthian
or
carthaginian
captives
and
now
behold
the
fate
of
the
freeborn
farmer
he
had
done
his
duty
toward
rome
and
he
had
fought
her
battles
without
complaint
but
when
he
came
home
after
ten
fifteen
or
twenty
years
his
lands
were
covered
with
weeds
and
his
family
had
been
ruined
but
he
was
a
strong
man
and
willing
to
begin
life
anew
he
sowed
and
planted
and
waited
for
the
harvest
he
carried
his
grain
to
the
market
together
with
his
cattle
and
his
poultry
to
find
that
the
large
landowners
who
worked
their
estates
with
slaves
could
underbid
him
all
along
the
line
for
a
couple
of
years
he
tried
to
hold
his
own
then
he
gave
up
in
despair
he
left
the
country
and
he
went
to
the
nearest
city
in
the
city
he
was
as
hungry
as
he
had
been
before
on
the
land
but
he
shared
his
misery
with
thousands
of
other
disinherited
beings
they
crouched
together
in
filthy
hovels
in
the
suburbs
of
the
large
cities
they
were
apt
to
get
sick
and
die
from
terrible
epidemics
they
were
all
profoundly
discontented
they
had
fought
for
their
country
and
this
was
their
reward
they
were
always
willing
to
listen
to
those
plausible
who
gather
around
a
public
grievance
like
so
many
hungry
vultures
and
soon
they
became
a
grave
menace
to
the
safety
of
the
state
but
the
class
of
the
shrugged
its
shoulders
we
have
our
army
and
our
policemen
they
argued
they
will
keep
the
mob
in
order
and
they
hid
themselves
behind
the
high
walls
of
their
pleasant
villas
and
cultivated
their
gardens
and
read
the
poems
of
a
certain
homer
which
a
greek
slave
had
just
translated
into
very
pleasing
latin
hexameters
in
a
few
families
however
the
old
tradition
of
unselfish
service
to
the
commonwealth
continued
cornelia
the
daughter
of
scipio
africanus
had
been
married
to
a
roman
by
the
name
of
gracchus
she
had
two
sons
tiberius
and
gaius
when
the
boys
grew
up
they
entered
politics
and
tried
to
bring
about
certain
reforms
a
census
had
shown
that
most
of
the
land
of
the
italian
peninsula
was
owned
by
two
thousand
noble
families
tiberius
gracchus
having
been
elected
a
tribune
tried
to
help
the
freemen
he
revived
two
ancient
laws
which
restricted
the
number
of
acres
which
a
single
owner
might
possess
in
this
way
he
hoped
to
revive
the
valuable
old
class
of
small
and
independent
freeholders
the
called
him
a
robber
and
an
enemy
of
the
state
there
were
street
riots
a
party
of
thugs
was
hired
to
kill
the
popular
tribune
tiberius
gracchus
was
attacked
when
he
entered
the
assembly
and
was
beaten
to
death
ten
years
later
his
brother
gaius
tried
the
experiment
of
reforming
a
nation
against
the
expressed
wishes
of
a
strong
privileged
class
he
passed
a
poor
law
which
was
meant
to
help
the
destitute
farmers
eventually
it
made
the
greater
part
of
the
roman
citizens
into
professional
beggars
he
established
colonies
of
destitute
people
in
distant
parts
of
the
empire
but
these
settlements
failed
to
attract
the
right
sort
of
people
before
gaius
gracchus
could
do
more
harm
he
too
was
murdered
and
his
followers
were
either
killed
or
exiled
the
first
two
reformers
had
been
gentlemen
the
two
who
came
after
were
of
a
very
different
stamp
they
were
professional
soldiers
one
was
called
marius
the
name
of
the
other
was
sulla
both
enjoyed
a
large
personal
following
sulla
was
the
leader
of
the
landowners
marius
the
victor
in
a
great
battle
at
the
foot
of
the
alps
when
the
teutons
and
the
cimbri
had
been
annihilated
was
the
popular
hero
of
the
disinherited
freemen
now
it
happened
in
the
year
that
the
senate
of
rome
was
greatly
disturbed
by
rumours
that
came
from
asia
mithridates
king
of
a
country
along
the
shores
of
the
black
sea
and
a
greek
on
his
mother
side
had
seen
the
possibility
of
establishing
a
second
alexandrian
empire
he
began
his
campaign
for
with
the
murder
of
all
roman
citizens
who
happened
to
be
in
asia
minor
men
women
and
children
such
an
act
of
course
meant
war
the
senate
equipped
an
army
to
march
against
the
king
of
pontus
and
punish
him
for
his
crime
but
who
was
to
be
sulla
said
the
senate
because
he
is
consul
marius
said
the
mob
because
he
has
been
consul
five
times
and
because
he
is
the
champion
of
our
rights
possession
is
nine
points
of
the
law
sulla
happened
to
be
in
actual
command
of
the
army
he
went
west
to
defeat
mithridates
and
marius
fled
to
africa
there
he
waited
until
he
heard
that
sulla
had
crossed
into
asia
he
then
returned
to
italy
gathered
a
motley
crew
of
malcontents
marched
on
rome
and
entered
the
city
with
his
professional
highwaymen
spent
five
days
and
five
nights
slaughtering
the
enemies
of
the
senatorial
party
got
himself
elected
consul
and
promptly
died
from
the
excitement
of
the
last
fortnight
there
followed
four
years
of
disorder
then
sulla
having
defeated
mithridates
announced
that
he
was
ready
to
return
to
rome
and
settle
a
few
old
scores
of
his
own
he
was
as
good
as
his
word
for
weeks
his
soldiers
were
busy
executing
those
of
their
fellow
citizens
who
were
suspected
of
democratic
sympathies
one
day
they
got
hold
of
a
young
fellow
who
had
been
often
seen
in
the
company
of
marius
they
were
going
to
hang
him
when
some
one
interfered
the
boy
is
too
young
he
said
and
they
let
him
go
his
name
was
julius
caesar
you
shall
meet
him
again
on
the
next
page
as
for
sulla
he
became
dictator
which
meant
sole
and
supreme
ruler
of
all
the
roman
possessions
he
ruled
rome
for
four
years
and
he
died
quietly
in
his
bed
having
spent
the
last
year
of
his
life
tenderly
raising
his
cabbages
as
was
the
custom
of
so
many
romans
who
had
spent
a
lifetime
killing
their
but
conditions
did
not
grow
better
on
the
contrary
they
grew
worse
another
general
gnaeus
pompeius
or
pompey
a
close
friend
of
sulla
went
east
to
renew
the
war
against
the
ever
troublesome
mithridates
he
drove
that
energetic
potentate
into
the
mountains
where
mithridates
took
poison
and
killed
himself
well
knowing
what
fate
awaited
him
as
a
roman
captive
next
he
the
authority
of
rome
over
syria
destroyed
jerusalem
roamed
through
western
asia
trying
to
revive
the
myth
of
alexander
the
great
and
at
last
in
the
year
returned
to
rome
with
a
dozen
of
defeated
kings
and
princes
and
generals
all
of
whom
were
forced
to
march
in
the
triumphal
procession
of
this
enormously
popular
roman
who
presented
his
city
with
the
sum
of
forty
million
dollars
in
plunder
it
was
necessary
that
the
government
of
rome
be
placed
in
the
hands
of
a
strong
man
only
a
few
months
before
the
town
had
almost
fallen
into
the
hands
of
a
young
aristocrat
by
the
name
of
catiline
who
had
gambled
away
his
money
and
hoped
to
reimburse
himself
for
his
losses
by
a
little
plundering
cicero
a
lawyer
had
discovered
the
plot
had
warned
the
senate
and
had
forced
catiline
to
flee
but
there
were
other
young
men
with
similar
ambitions
and
it
was
no
time
for
idle
talk
pompey
organised
a
triumvirate
which
was
to
take
charge
of
affairs
he
became
the
leader
of
this
vigilante
committee
gaius
julius
caesar
who
had
made
a
reputation
for
himself
as
governor
of
spain
was
the
second
in
command
the
third
was
an
indifferent
sort
of
person
by
the
name
of
crassus
he
had
been
elected
because
he
was
incredibly
rich
having
been
a
successful
contractor
of
war
supplies
he
soon
went
upon
an
expedition
against
the
parthians
and
was
killed
as
for
caesar
who
was
by
far
the
ablest
of
the
three
he
decided
that
he
needed
a
little
more
military
glory
to
become
a
popular
hero
he
crossed
the
alps
and
conquered
that
part
of
the
world
which
is
now
called
france
then
he
hammered
a
solid
wooden
bridge
across
the
rhine
and
invaded
the
land
of
the
wild
teutons
finally
he
took
ship
and
visited
england
heaven
knows
where
he
might
have
ended
if
he
had
not
been
forced
to
return
to
italy
pompey
so
he
was
informed
had
been
appointed
dictator
for
life
this
of
course
meant
that
caesar
was
to
be
placed
on
the
list
of
the
retired
officers
and
the
idea
did
not
appeal
to
him
he
remembered
that
he
had
begun
life
as
a
follower
of
marius
he
decided
to
teach
the
senators
and
their
dictator
another
lesson
he
crossed
the
rubicon
river
which
separated
the
province
of
gaul
from
italy
everywhere
he
was
received
as
the
friend
of
the
people
without
difficulty
caesar
entered
rome
and
pompey
fled
to
greece
caesar
followed
him
and
defeated
his
followers
near
pharsalus
pompey
sailed
across
the
mediterranean
and
escaped
to
egypt
when
he
landed
he
was
murdered
by
order
of
young
king
ptolemy
a
few
days
later
caesar
arrived
he
found
himself
caught
in
a
trap
both
the
egyptians
and
the
roman
garrison
which
had
remained
faithful
to
pompey
attacked
his
camp
fortune
was
with
caesar
he
succeeded
in
setting
fire
to
the
egyptian
fleet
incidentally
the
sparks
of
the
burning
vessels
fell
on
the
roof
of
the
famous
library
of
alexandria
which
was
just
off
the
water
front
and
destroyed
it
next
he
attacked
the
egyptian
army
drove
the
soldiers
into
the
nile
drowned
ptolemy
and
established
a
new
government
under
cleopatra
the
sister
of
the
late
king
just
then
word
reached
him
that
pharnaces
the
son
and
heir
of
mithridates
had
gone
on
the
caesar
marched
northward
defeated
pharnaces
in
a
war
which
lasted
five
days
sent
word
of
his
victory
to
rome
in
the
famous
sentence
veni
vidi
vici
which
is
latin
for
i
came
i
saw
i
conquered
and
returned
to
egypt
where
he
fell
desperately
in
love
with
cleopatra
who
followed
him
to
rome
when
he
returned
to
take
charge
of
the
government
in
the
year
he
marched
at
the
head
of
not
less
than
four
different
having
won
four
different
campaigns
then
caesar
appeared
in
the
senate
to
report
upon
his
adventures
and
the
grateful
senate
made
him
dictator
for
ten
years
it
was
a
fatal
step
the
new
dictator
made
serious
attempts
to
reform
the
roman
state
he
made
it
possible
for
freemen
to
become
members
of
the
senate
he
conferred
the
rights
of
citizenship
upon
distant
communities
as
had
been
done
in
the
early
days
of
roman
history
he
permitted
foreigners
to
exercise
influence
upon
the
government
he
reformed
the
administration
of
the
distant
provinces
which
certain
aristocratic
families
had
come
to
regard
as
their
private
possessions
in
short
he
did
many
things
for
the
good
of
the
majority
of
the
people
but
which
made
him
thoroughly
unpopular
with
the
most
powerful
men
in
the
state
half
a
hundred
young
aristocrats
formed
a
plot
to
save
the
republic
on
the
ides
of
march
the
fifteenth
of
march
according
to
that
new
calendar
which
caesar
had
brought
with
him
from
egypt
caesar
was
murdered
when
he
entered
the
senate
once
more
rome
was
without
a
master
there
were
two
men
who
tried
to
continue
the
tradition
of
glory
one
was
antony
his
former
secretary
the
other
was
octavian
caesar
and
heir
to
his
estate
octavian
remained
in
rome
but
antony
went
to
egypt
to
be
near
cleopatra
with
whom
he
too
had
fallen
in
love
as
seems
to
have
been
the
habit
of
roman
generals
a
war
broke
out
between
the
two
in
the
battle
of
actium
octavian
defeated
antony
antony
killed
himself
and
cleopatra
was
left
alone
to
face
the
enemy
she
tried
very
hard
to
make
octavian
her
third
roman
conquest
when
she
saw
that
she
could
make
no
impression
upon
this
very
proud
aristocrat
she
killed
herself
and
egypt
became
a
roman
province
as
for
octavian
he
was
a
very
wise
young
man
and
he
did
not
repeat
the
mistake
of
his
famous
uncle
he
knew
how
people
will
shy
at
words
he
was
very
modest
in
his
demands
when
he
returned
to
rome
he
did
not
want
to
be
a
dictator
he
would
be
entirely
satisfied
with
the
title
of
the
honourable
but
when
the
senate
a
few
years
later
addressed
him
as
augustus
the
illustrious
he
did
not
object
and
a
few
years
later
the
man
in
the
street
called
him
caesar
or
kaiser
while
the
soldiers
accustomed
to
regard
octavian
as
their
referred
to
him
as
the
chief
the
imperator
or
emperor
the
republic
had
become
an
empire
but
the
average
roman
was
hardly
aware
of
the
fact
in
his
position
as
the
absolute
ruler
of
the
roman
people
had
become
so
well
established
that
he
was
made
an
object
of
that
divine
worship
which
hitherto
had
been
reserved
for
the
gods
and
his
successors
were
true
emperors
the
absolute
rulers
of
the
greatest
empire
the
world
had
ever
seen
if
the
truth
be
told
the
average
citizen
was
sick
and
tired
of
anarchy
and
disorder
he
did
not
care
who
ruled
him
provided
the
new
master
gave
him
a
chance
to
live
quietly
and
without
the
noise
of
eternal
street
riots
octavian
assured
his
subjects
forty
years
of
peace
he
had
no
desire
to
extend
the
frontiers
of
his
domains
in
the
year
he
had
an
invasion
of
the
northwestern
wilderness
which
was
inhabited
by
the
teutons
but
varrus
his
general
had
been
killed
with
all
his
men
in
the
teutoburg
woods
and
after
that
the
romans
made
no
further
attempts
to
civilise
these
wild
people
they
concentrated
their
efforts
upon
the
gigantic
problem
of
internal
reform
but
it
was
too
late
to
do
much
good
two
centuries
of
revolution
and
foreign
war
had
repeatedly
killed
the
best
men
among
the
younger
generations
it
had
ruined
the
class
of
the
free
farmers
it
had
introduced
slave
labor
against
which
no
freeman
could
hope
to
compete
it
had
turned
the
cities
into
beehives
inhabited
by
pauperized
and
unhealthy
mobs
of
runaway
peasants
it
had
created
a
large
bureaucracy
petty
officials
who
were
underpaid
and
who
were
forced
to
take
graft
in
order
to
buy
bread
and
clothing
for
their
families
worst
of
all
it
had
accustomed
people
to
violence
to
to
a
barbarous
pleasure
in
the
pain
and
suffering
of
others
outwardly
the
roman
state
during
the
first
century
of
our
era
was
a
magnificent
political
structure
so
large
that
alexander
empire
became
one
of
its
minor
provinces
underneath
this
glory
there
lived
millions
upon
millions
of
poor
and
tired
human
beings
toiling
like
ants
who
have
built
a
nest
underneath
a
heavy
stone
they
worked
for
the
benefit
of
some
one
else
they
shared
their
food
with
the
animals
of
the
fields
they
lived
in
stables
they
died
without
hope
it
was
the
seven
hundred
and
year
since
the
founding
of
rome
gaius
julius
caesar
octavianus
augustus
was
living
in
the
palace
of
the
palatine
hill
busily
engaged
upon
the
task
of
ruling
his
empire
in
a
little
village
of
distant
syria
mary
the
wife
of
joseph
the
carpenter
was
tending
her
little
boy
born
in
a
stable
of
bethlehem
this
is
a
strange
world
before
long
the
palace
and
the
stable
were
to
meet
in
open
combat
and
the
stable
was
to
emerge
victorious
joshua
of
nazareth
the
story
of
joshua
of
nazareth
whom
the
greeks
called
jesus
in
the
autumn
of
the
year
of
the
city
which
would
be
in
our
way
of
counting
time
aesculapius
cultellus
a
roman
physician
wrote
to
his
nephew
who
was
with
the
army
in
syria
as
follows
my
dear
nephew
a
few
days
ago
i
was
called
in
to
prescribe
for
a
sick
man
named
paul
he
appeared
to
be
a
roman
citizen
of
jewish
parentage
well
educated
and
of
agreeable
manners
i
had
been
told
that
he
was
here
in
connection
with
a
an
appeal
from
one
of
our
provincial
courts
caesarea
or
some
such
place
in
the
eastern
mediterranean
he
had
been
described
to
me
as
a
wild
and
violent
fellow
who
had
been
making
speeches
against
the
people
and
against
the
law
i
found
him
very
intelligent
and
of
great
honesty
a
friend
of
mine
who
used
to
be
with
the
army
in
asia
minor
tells
me
that
he
heard
something
about
him
in
ephesus
where
he
was
preaching
sermons
about
a
strange
new
god
i
asked
my
patient
if
this
were
true
and
whether
he
had
told
the
people
to
rebel
against
the
will
of
our
beloved
emperor
paul
answered
me
that
the
kingdom
of
which
he
had
spoken
was
not
of
this
world
and
he
added
many
strange
utterances
which
i
did
not
understand
but
which
were
probably
due
to
his
fever
his
personality
made
a
great
impression
upon
me
and
i
was
sorry
to
hear
that
he
was
killed
on
the
ostian
road
a
few
days
ago
therefore
i
am
writing
this
letter
to
you
when
next
you
visit
jerusalem
i
want
you
to
find
out
something
about
my
friend
paul
and
the
strange
jewish
prophet
who
seems
to
have
been
his
teacher
our
slaves
are
getting
much
excited
about
this
messiah
and
a
few
of
them
who
openly
talked
of
the
new
kingdom
whatever
that
means
have
been
crucified
i
would
like
to
know
the
truth
about
all
these
rumours
and
i
am
your
devoted
uncle
aesculapius
cultellus
six
weeks
later
gladius
ensa
the
nephew
a
captain
of
the
vii
gallic
infantry
answered
as
follows
my
dear
uncle
i
received
your
letter
and
i
have
obeyed
your
instructions
two
weeks
ago
our
brigade
was
sent
to
jerusalem
there
have
been
several
revolutions
during
the
last
century
and
there
is
not
much
left
of
the
old
city
we
have
been
here
now
for
a
month
and
we
shall
continue
our
march
to
petra
where
there
has
been
trouble
with
some
of
the
arab
tribes
i
shall
use
this
evening
to
answer
your
questions
but
pray
do
not
expect
a
detailed
report
i
have
talked
with
most
of
the
older
men
in
this
city
but
few
have
been
able
to
give
me
any
definite
information
a
few
days
ago
a
pedler
came
to
the
camp
i
bought
some
of
his
olives
and
i
asked
him
whether
he
had
ever
heard
of
the
famous
messiah
who
was
killed
when
he
was
young
he
said
that
he
remembered
it
very
clearly
because
his
father
had
taken
him
to
golgotha
a
hill
just
outside
the
city
to
see
the
execution
and
to
show
him
what
became
of
the
enemies
of
the
laws
of
the
people
of
judaea
he
gave
me
the
address
of
one
joseph
who
had
been
a
personal
friend
of
the
messiah
and
told
me
that
i
had
better
go
and
see
him
if
i
wanted
to
know
more
this
morning
i
went
to
call
on
joseph
he
was
quite
an
old
man
he
had
been
a
fisherman
on
one
of
the
lakes
his
memory
was
clear
and
from
him
at
last
i
got
a
fairly
definite
account
of
what
had
happened
during
the
troublesome
days
before
i
was
born
tiberius
our
great
and
glorious
emperor
was
on
the
throne
and
an
officer
of
the
name
of
pontius
pilatus
was
governor
of
judaea
and
samaria
joseph
knew
little
about
this
pilatus
he
seemed
to
have
been
an
honest
enough
official
who
left
a
decent
reputation
as
procurator
of
the
province
in
the
year
or
joseph
had
forgotten
when
pilatus
was
called
to
jerusalem
on
account
of
a
riot
a
certain
young
man
the
son
of
a
carpenter
of
nazareth
was
said
to
be
planning
a
revolution
against
the
roman
government
strangely
enough
our
own
intelligence
officers
who
are
usually
well
informed
appear
to
have
heard
nothing
about
it
and
when
they
investigated
the
matter
they
reported
that
the
carpenter
was
an
excellent
citizen
and
that
there
was
no
reason
to
proceed
against
him
but
the
leaders
of
the
jewish
faith
according
to
joseph
were
much
upset
they
greatly
disliked
his
popularity
with
the
masses
of
the
poorer
hebrews
the
nazarene
so
they
told
pilatus
had
publicly
claimed
that
a
greek
or
a
roman
or
even
a
philistine
who
tried
to
live
a
decent
and
honourable
life
was
quite
as
good
as
a
jew
who
spent
his
days
studying
the
ancient
laws
of
moses
pilatus
does
not
seem
to
have
been
impressed
by
this
argument
but
when
the
crowds
around
the
temple
threatened
to
lynch
jesus
and
kill
all
his
followers
he
decided
to
take
the
carpenter
into
custody
to
save
his
life
he
does
not
appear
to
have
understood
the
real
nature
of
the
quarrel
whenever
he
asked
the
jewish
priests
to
explain
their
grievances
they
shouted
heresy
and
treason
and
got
terribly
excited
finally
so
joseph
told
me
pilatus
sent
for
joshua
that
was
the
name
of
the
nazarene
but
the
greeks
who
live
in
this
part
of
the
world
always
refer
to
him
as
jesus
to
examine
him
personally
he
talked
to
him
for
several
hours
he
asked
him
about
the
dangerous
doctrines
which
he
was
said
to
have
preached
on
the
shores
of
the
sea
of
galilee
but
jesus
answered
that
he
never
referred
to
politics
he
was
not
so
much
interested
in
the
bodies
of
men
as
in
man
soul
he
wanted
all
people
to
regard
their
neighbours
as
their
brothers
and
to
love
one
single
god
who
was
the
father
of
all
living
beings
pilatus
who
seems
to
have
been
well
versed
in
the
doctrines
of
the
stoics
and
the
other
greek
philosophers
does
not
appear
to
have
discovered
anything
seditious
in
the
talk
of
jesus
according
to
my
informant
he
made
another
attempt
to
save
the
life
of
the
kindly
prophet
he
kept
putting
the
execution
off
meanwhile
the
jewish
people
lashed
into
fury
by
their
priests
got
frantic
with
rage
there
had
been
many
riots
in
jerusalem
before
this
and
there
were
only
a
few
roman
soldiers
within
calling
distance
reports
were
being
sent
to
the
roman
authorities
in
caesarea
that
pilatus
had
fallen
a
victim
to
the
teachings
of
the
nazarene
petitions
were
being
circulated
all
through
the
city
to
have
pilatus
recalled
because
he
was
an
enemy
of
the
emperor
you
know
that
our
governors
have
strict
instructions
to
avoid
an
open
break
with
their
foreign
subjects
to
save
the
country
from
civil
war
pilatus
finally
sacrificed
his
prisoner
joshua
who
behaved
with
great
dignity
and
who
forgave
all
those
who
hated
him
he
was
crucified
amidst
the
howls
and
the
laughter
of
the
jerusalem
mob
that
is
what
joseph
told
me
with
tears
running
down
his
old
cheeks
i
gave
him
a
gold
piece
when
i
left
him
but
he
refused
it
and
asked
me
to
hand
it
to
one
poorer
than
himself
i
also
asked
him
a
few
questions
about
your
friend
paul
he
had
known
him
slightly
he
seems
to
have
been
a
tent
maker
who
gave
up
his
profession
that
he
might
preach
the
words
of
a
loving
and
forgiving
god
who
was
so
very
different
from
that
jehovah
of
whom
the
jewish
priests
are
telling
us
all
the
time
afterwards
paul
appears
to
have
travelled
much
in
asia
minor
and
in
greece
telling
the
slaves
that
they
were
all
children
of
one
loving
father
and
that
happiness
awaits
all
both
rich
and
poor
who
have
tried
to
live
honest
lives
and
have
done
good
to
those
who
were
suffering
and
miserable
i
hope
that
i
have
answered
your
questions
to
your
satisfaction
the
whole
story
seems
very
harmless
to
me
as
far
as
the
safety
of
the
state
is
concerned
but
then
we
romans
never
have
been
able
to
understand
the
people
of
this
province
i
am
sorry
that
they
have
killed
your
friend
paul
i
wish
that
i
were
at
home
again
and
i
am
as
ever
your
dutiful
nephew
gladius
ensa
the
fall
of
rome
the
twilight
of
rome
the
of
ancient
history
give
the
date
as
the
year
in
which
rome
fell
because
in
that
year
the
last
emperor
was
driven
off
his
throne
but
rome
which
was
not
built
in
a
day
took
a
long
time
falling
the
process
was
so
slow
and
so
gradual
that
most
romans
did
not
realise
how
their
old
world
was
coming
to
an
end
they
complained
about
the
unrest
of
the
times
they
grumbled
about
the
high
prices
of
food
and
about
the
low
wages
of
the
workmen
they
cursed
the
profiteers
who
had
a
monopoly
of
the
grain
and
the
wool
and
the
gold
coin
occasionally
they
rebelled
against
an
unusually
rapacious
governor
but
the
majority
of
the
people
during
the
first
four
centuries
of
our
era
ate
and
drank
whatever
their
purse
allowed
them
to
buy
and
hated
or
loved
according
to
their
nature
and
went
to
the
theatre
whenever
there
was
a
free
show
of
fighting
gladiators
or
starved
in
the
slums
of
the
big
cities
utterly
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
their
empire
had
outlived
its
usefulness
and
was
doomed
to
perish
how
could
they
realise
the
threatened
danger
rome
made
a
fine
showing
of
outward
glory
roads
connected
the
different
provinces
the
imperial
police
were
active
and
showed
little
tenderness
for
highwaymen
the
frontier
was
closely
guarded
against
the
savage
tribes
who
seemed
to
be
occupying
the
waste
lands
of
northern
europe
the
whole
world
was
paying
tribute
to
the
mighty
city
of
rome
and
a
score
of
able
men
were
working
day
and
night
to
undo
the
mistakes
of
the
past
and
bring
about
a
return
to
the
happier
conditions
of
the
early
republic
but
the
underlying
causes
of
the
decay
of
the
state
of
which
i
have
told
you
in
a
former
chapter
had
not
been
removed
and
reform
therefore
was
impossible
rome
was
first
and
last
and
all
the
time
a
as
athens
and
corinth
had
been
in
ancient
hellas
it
had
been
able
to
dominate
the
italian
peninsula
but
rome
as
the
ruler
of
the
entire
civilised
world
was
a
political
impossibility
and
could
not
endure
her
young
men
were
killed
in
her
endless
wars
her
farmers
were
ruined
by
long
military
service
and
by
taxation
they
either
became
professional
beggars
or
hired
themselves
out
to
rich
landowners
who
gave
them
board
and
lodging
in
exchange
for
their
services
and
made
them
serfs
those
unfortunate
human
beings
who
are
neither
slaves
nor
freemen
but
who
have
become
part
of
the
soil
upon
which
they
work
like
so
many
cows
and
the
trees
the
empire
the
state
had
become
everything
the
common
citizen
had
dwindled
down
to
less
than
nothing
as
for
the
slaves
they
had
heard
the
words
that
were
spoken
by
paul
they
had
accepted
the
message
of
the
humble
carpenter
of
nazareth
they
did
not
rebel
against
their
masters
on
the
contrary
they
had
been
taught
to
be
meek
and
they
obeyed
their
superiors
but
they
had
lost
all
interest
in
the
affairs
of
this
world
which
had
proved
such
a
miserable
place
of
abode
they
were
willing
to
fight
the
good
fight
that
they
might
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
heaven
but
they
were
not
willing
to
engage
in
warfare
for
the
benefit
of
an
ambitious
emperor
who
aspired
to
glory
by
way
of
a
foreign
campaign
in
the
land
of
the
parthians
or
the
numidians
or
the
scots
and
so
conditions
grew
worse
as
the
centuries
went
by
the
first
emperors
had
continued
the
tradition
of
leadership
which
had
given
the
old
tribal
chieftains
such
a
hold
upon
their
subjects
but
the
emperors
of
the
second
and
third
centuries
were
professional
soldiers
who
existed
by
the
grace
of
their
the
praetorians
they
succeeded
each
other
with
terrifying
rapidity
murdering
their
way
into
the
palace
and
being
murdered
out
of
it
as
soon
as
their
successors
had
become
rich
enough
to
bribe
the
guards
into
a
new
rebellion
meanwhile
the
barbarians
were
hammering
at
the
gates
of
the
northern
frontier
as
there
were
no
longer
any
native
roman
armies
to
stop
their
progress
foreign
mercenaries
had
to
be
hired
to
fight
the
invader
as
the
foreign
soldier
happened
to
be
of
the
same
blood
as
his
supposed
enemy
he
was
apt
to
be
quite
lenient
when
he
engaged
in
battle
finally
by
way
of
experiment
a
few
tribes
were
allowed
to
settle
within
the
confines
of
the
empire
others
followed
soon
these
tribes
complained
bitterly
of
the
greedy
roman
who
took
away
their
last
penny
when
they
got
no
redress
they
marched
to
rome
and
loudly
demanded
that
they
be
heard
this
made
rome
very
uncomfortable
as
an
imperial
residence
constantine
who
ruled
from
to
looked
for
a
new
capital
he
chose
byzantium
the
for
the
commerce
between
europe
and
asia
the
city
was
renamed
constantinople
and
the
court
moved
eastward
when
constantine
died
his
two
sons
for
the
sake
of
a
more
efficient
administration
divided
the
empire
between
them
the
elder
lived
in
rome
and
ruled
in
the
west
the
younger
stayed
in
constantinople
and
was
master
of
the
east
then
came
the
fourth
century
and
the
terrible
visitation
of
the
huns
those
mysterious
asiatic
horsemen
who
for
more
than
two
centuries
maintained
themselves
in
northern
europe
and
continued
their
career
of
bloodshed
until
they
were
defeated
near
in
france
in
the
year
as
soon
as
the
huns
had
reached
the
danube
they
had
begun
to
press
hard
upon
the
goths
the
goths
in
order
to
save
themselves
were
thereupon
obliged
to
invade
rome
the
emperor
valens
tried
to
stop
them
but
was
killed
near
adrianople
in
the
year
years
later
under
their
king
alaric
these
same
west
goths
marched
westward
and
attacked
rome
they
did
not
plunder
and
destroyed
only
a
few
palaces
next
came
the
vandals
and
showed
less
respect
for
the
venerable
traditions
of
the
city
then
the
burgundians
then
the
east
goths
then
the
alemanni
then
the
franks
there
was
no
end
to
the
invasions
rome
at
last
was
at
the
mercy
of
every
ambitious
highway
robber
who
could
gather
a
few
followers
in
the
year
the
emperor
fled
to
ravenna
which
was
a
and
strongly
fortified
and
there
in
the
year
odoacer
commander
of
a
regiment
of
the
german
mercenaries
who
wanted
the
farms
of
italy
to
be
divided
among
themselves
gently
but
effectively
pushed
romulus
augustulus
the
last
of
the
emperors
who
ruled
the
western
division
from
his
throne
and
proclaimed
himself
patriarch
or
ruler
of
rome
the
eastern
emperor
who
was
very
busy
with
his
own
affairs
recognised
him
and
for
ten
years
odoacer
ruled
what
was
left
of
the
western
provinces
a
few
years
later
theodoric
king
of
the
east
goths
invaded
the
newly
formed
patriciat
took
ravenna
murdered
odoacer
at
his
own
dinner
table
and
established
a
gothic
kingdom
amidst
the
ruins
of
the
western
part
of
the
empire
this
patriciate
state
did
not
last
long
in
the
sixth
century
a
motley
crowd
of
longobards
and
saxons
and
slavs
and
avars
invaded
italy
destroyed
the
gothic
kingdom
and
established
a
new
state
of
which
pavia
became
the
capital
then
at
last
the
imperial
city
sank
into
a
state
of
utter
neglect
and
despair
the
ancient
palaces
had
been
plundered
time
and
again
the
schools
had
been
burned
down
the
teachers
had
been
starved
to
death
the
rich
people
had
been
thrown
out
of
their
villas
which
were
now
inhabited
by
and
hairy
barbarians
the
roads
had
fallen
into
decay
the
old
bridges
were
gone
and
commerce
had
come
to
a
standstill
civilisation
the
product
of
thousands
of
years
of
patient
labor
on
the
part
of
egyptians
and
babylonians
and
greeks
and
romans
which
had
lifted
man
high
above
the
most
daring
dreams
of
his
earliest
ancestors
threatened
to
perish
from
the
western
continent
it
is
true
that
in
the
far
east
constantinople
continued
to
be
the
centre
of
an
empire
for
another
thousand
years
but
it
hardly
counted
as
a
part
of
the
european
continent
its
interests
lay
in
the
east
it
began
to
forget
its
western
origin
gradually
the
roman
language
was
given
up
for
the
greek
the
roman
alphabet
was
discarded
and
roman
law
was
written
in
greek
characters
and
explained
by
greek
judges
the
emperor
became
an
asiatic
despot
worshipped
as
the
kings
of
thebes
had
been
worshipped
in
the
valley
of
the
nile
three
thousand
years
before
when
missionaries
of
the
byzantine
church
looked
for
fresh
fields
of
activity
they
went
eastward
and
carried
the
civilisation
of
byzantium
into
the
vast
wilderness
of
russia
as
for
the
west
it
was
left
to
the
mercies
of
the
barbarians
for
twelve
generations
murder
war
arson
plundering
were
the
order
of
the
day
one
thing
and
one
thing
alone
saved
europe
from
complete
destruction
from
a
return
to
the
days
of
and
the
hyena
this
was
the
church
the
flock
of
humble
men
and
women
who
for
many
centuries
had
confessed
themselves
the
followers
of
jesus
the
carpenter
of
nazareth
who
had
been
killed
that
the
mighty
roman
empire
might
be
saved
the
trouble
of
a
in
a
little
city
somewhere
along
the
syrian
frontier
rise
of
the
church
how
rome
became
the
centre
of
the
christian
world
the
average
intelligent
roman
who
lived
under
the
empire
had
taken
very
little
interest
in
the
gods
of
his
fathers
a
few
times
a
year
he
went
to
the
temple
but
merely
as
a
matter
of
custom
he
looked
on
patiently
when
the
people
celebrated
a
religious
festival
with
a
solemn
procession
but
he
regarded
the
worship
of
jupiter
and
minerva
and
neptune
as
something
rather
childish
a
survival
from
the
crude
days
of
the
early
republic
and
not
a
fit
subject
of
study
for
a
man
who
had
mastered
the
works
of
the
stoics
and
the
epicureans
and
the
other
great
philosophers
of
athens
this
attitude
made
the
roman
a
very
tolerant
man
the
government
insisted
that
all
people
romans
foreigners
greeks
babylonians
jews
should
pay
a
certain
outward
respect
to
the
image
of
the
emperor
which
was
supposed
to
stand
in
every
temple
just
as
a
picture
of
the
president
of
the
united
states
is
apt
to
hang
in
an
american
post
office
but
this
was
a
formality
without
any
deeper
meaning
generally
speaking
everybody
could
honour
revere
and
adore
whatever
gods
he
pleased
and
as
a
result
rome
was
filled
with
all
sorts
of
queer
little
temples
and
synagogues
dedicated
to
the
worship
of
egyptian
and
african
and
asiatic
divinities
when
the
first
disciples
of
jesus
reached
rome
and
began
to
preach
their
new
doctrine
of
a
universal
brotherhood
of
man
nobody
objected
the
man
in
the
street
stopped
and
listened
rome
the
capital
of
the
world
had
always
been
full
of
wandering
preachers
each
proclaiming
his
own
mystery
most
of
the
priests
appealed
to
the
senses
promised
golden
rewards
and
endless
pleasure
to
the
followers
of
their
own
particular
god
soon
the
crowd
in
the
street
noticed
that
the
christians
the
followers
of
the
christ
or
anointed
spoke
a
very
different
language
they
did
not
appear
to
be
impressed
by
great
riches
or
a
noble
position
they
extolled
the
beauties
of
poverty
and
humility
and
meekness
these
were
not
exactly
the
virtues
which
had
made
rome
the
mistress
of
the
world
it
was
rather
interesting
to
listen
to
a
mystery
which
told
people
in
the
of
their
glory
that
their
worldly
success
could
not
possibly
bring
them
lasting
happiness
besides
the
preachers
of
the
christian
mystery
told
dreadful
stories
of
the
fate
that
awaited
those
who
refused
to
listen
to
the
words
of
the
true
god
it
was
never
wise
to
take
chances
of
course
the
old
roman
gods
still
existed
but
were
they
strong
enough
to
protect
their
friends
against
the
powers
of
this
new
deity
who
had
been
brought
to
europe
from
distant
asia
people
began
to
have
doubts
they
returned
to
listen
to
further
explanations
of
the
new
creed
after
a
while
they
began
to
meet
the
men
and
women
who
preached
the
words
of
jesus
they
found
them
very
different
from
the
average
roman
priests
they
were
all
dreadfully
poor
they
were
kind
to
slaves
and
to
animals
they
did
not
try
to
gain
riches
but
gave
away
whatever
they
had
the
example
of
their
unselfish
lives
forced
many
romans
to
forsake
the
old
religion
they
joined
the
small
communities
of
christians
who
met
in
the
back
rooms
of
private
houses
or
somewhere
in
an
open
field
and
the
temples
were
deserted
this
went
on
year
after
year
and
the
number
of
christians
continued
to
increase
presbyters
or
priests
the
original
greek
meant
elder
were
elected
to
guard
the
interests
of
the
small
churches
a
bishop
was
made
the
head
of
all
the
communities
within
a
single
province
peter
who
had
paul
to
rome
was
the
first
bishop
of
rome
in
due
time
his
successors
who
were
addressed
as
father
or
papa
came
to
be
known
as
popes
the
church
became
a
powerful
institution
within
the
empire
the
christian
doctrines
appealed
to
those
who
despaired
of
this
world
they
also
attracted
many
strong
men
who
found
it
impossible
to
make
a
career
under
the
imperial
government
but
who
could
exercise
their
gifts
of
leadership
among
the
humble
followers
of
the
nazarene
teacher
at
last
the
state
was
obliged
to
take
notice
the
roman
empire
i
have
said
this
before
was
tolerant
through
indifference
it
allowed
everybody
to
seek
salvation
after
his
or
her
own
fashion
but
it
insisted
that
the
different
sects
keep
the
peace
among
themselves
and
obey
the
wise
rule
of
live
and
let
live
the
christian
communities
however
refused
to
practice
any
sort
of
tolerance
they
publicly
declared
that
their
god
and
their
god
alone
was
the
true
ruler
of
heaven
and
earth
and
that
all
other
gods
were
imposters
this
seemed
unfair
to
the
other
sects
and
the
police
discouraged
such
utterances
the
christians
persisted
soon
there
were
further
difficulties
the
christians
refused
to
go
through
the
formalities
of
paying
homage
to
the
emperor
they
refused
to
appear
when
they
were
called
upon
to
join
the
army
the
roman
magistrates
threatened
to
punish
them
the
christians
answered
that
this
miserable
world
was
only
the
to
a
very
pleasant
heaven
and
that
they
were
more
than
willing
to
suffer
death
for
their
principles
the
romans
puzzled
by
such
conduct
sometimes
killed
the
offenders
but
more
often
they
did
not
there
was
a
certain
amount
of
lynching
during
the
earliest
years
of
the
church
but
this
was
the
work
of
that
part
of
the
mob
which
accused
their
meek
christian
neighbours
of
every
conceivable
crime
such
as
slaughtering
and
eating
babies
bringing
about
sickness
and
pestilence
betraying
the
country
in
times
of
danger
because
it
was
a
harmless
sport
and
devoid
of
danger
as
the
christians
refused
to
fight
back
meanwhile
rome
continued
to
be
invaded
by
the
barbarians
and
when
her
armies
failed
christian
missionaries
went
forth
to
preach
their
gospel
of
peace
to
the
wild
teutons
they
were
strong
men
without
fear
of
death
they
spoke
a
language
which
left
no
doubt
as
to
the
future
of
unrepentant
sinners
the
teutons
were
deeply
impressed
they
still
had
a
deep
respect
for
the
wisdom
of
the
ancient
city
of
rome
those
men
were
romans
they
probably
spoke
the
truth
soon
the
christian
missionary
became
a
power
in
the
savage
regions
of
the
teutons
and
the
franks
half
a
dozen
missionaries
were
as
valuable
as
a
whole
regiment
of
soldiers
the
emperors
began
to
understand
that
the
christian
might
be
of
great
use
to
them
in
some
of
the
provinces
they
were
given
equal
rights
with
those
who
remained
faithful
to
the
old
gods
the
great
change
however
came
during
the
last
half
of
the
fourth
century
constantine
sometimes
heaven
knows
why
called
constantine
the
great
was
emperor
he
was
a
terrible
ruffian
but
people
of
tender
qualities
could
hardly
hope
to
survive
in
that
age
during
a
long
and
checkered
career
constantine
had
experienced
many
ups
and
downs
once
when
almost
defeated
by
his
enemies
he
thought
that
he
would
try
the
power
of
this
new
asiatic
deity
of
whom
everybody
was
talking
he
promised
that
he
too
would
become
a
christian
if
he
were
successful
in
the
coming
battle
he
won
the
victory
and
thereafter
he
was
convinced
of
the
power
of
the
christian
god
and
allowed
himself
to
be
baptised
from
that
moment
on
the
christian
church
was
officially
recognised
and
this
greatly
strengthened
the
position
of
the
new
faith
but
the
christians
still
formed
a
very
small
minority
of
all
the
people
not
more
than
five
or
six
percent
and
in
order
to
win
they
were
forced
to
refuse
all
compromise
the
old
gods
must
be
destroyed
for
a
short
spell
the
emperor
julian
a
lover
of
greek
wisdom
managed
to
save
the
pagan
gods
from
further
destruction
but
julian
died
of
his
wounds
during
a
campaign
in
persia
and
his
successor
jovian
the
church
in
all
its
glory
one
after
the
other
the
doors
of
the
ancient
temples
were
then
closed
then
came
the
emperor
justinian
who
built
the
church
of
saint
sophia
in
constantinople
who
discontinued
the
school
of
philosophy
at
athens
which
had
been
founded
by
plato
that
was
the
end
of
the
old
greek
world
in
which
man
had
been
allowed
to
think
his
own
thoughts
and
dream
his
own
dreams
according
to
his
desires
the
somewhat
vague
rules
of
conduct
of
the
philosophers
had
proved
a
poor
compass
by
which
to
steer
the
ship
of
life
after
a
deluge
of
savagery
and
ignorance
had
swept
away
the
established
order
of
things
there
was
need
of
something
more
positive
and
more
definite
this
the
church
provided
during
an
age
when
nothing
was
certain
the
church
stood
like
a
rock
and
never
receded
from
those
principles
which
it
held
to
be
true
and
sacred
this
steadfast
courage
gained
the
admiration
of
the
multitudes
and
carried
the
church
of
rome
safely
through
the
difficulties
which
destroyed
the
roman
state
there
was
however
a
certain
element
of
luck
in
the
final
success
of
the
christian
faith
after
the
disappearance
of
theodoric
kingdom
in
the
fifth
century
italy
was
comparatively
free
from
foreign
invasion
the
lombards
and
saxons
and
slavs
who
succeeded
the
goths
were
weak
and
backward
tribes
under
those
circumstances
it
was
possible
for
the
bishops
of
rome
to
maintain
the
independence
of
their
city
soon
the
remnants
of
the
empire
scattered
throughout
the
peninsula
recognised
the
dukes
of
rome
or
bishops
as
their
political
and
spiritual
rulers
the
stage
was
set
for
the
appearance
of
a
strong
man
he
came
in
the
year
and
his
name
was
gregory
he
belonged
to
the
ruling
classes
of
ancient
rome
and
he
had
been
prefect
or
mayor
of
the
city
then
he
had
become
a
monk
and
a
bishop
and
finally
and
much
against
his
will
for
he
wanted
to
be
a
missionary
and
preach
christianity
to
the
heathen
of
england
he
had
been
dragged
to
the
church
of
saint
peter
to
be
made
pope
he
ruled
only
fourteen
years
but
when
he
died
the
christian
world
of
western
europe
had
officially
recognised
the
bishops
of
rome
the
popes
as
the
head
of
the
entire
church
this
power
however
did
not
extend
to
the
east
in
constantinople
the
emperors
continued
the
old
custom
which
had
recognised
the
successors
of
augustus
and
tiberius
both
as
head
of
the
government
and
as
high
priest
of
the
established
religion
in
the
year
the
eastern
roman
empire
was
conquered
by
the
turks
constantinople
was
taken
and
constantine
paleologue
the
last
roman
emperor
was
killed
on
the
steps
of
the
church
of
the
holy
sophia
a
few
years
before
zoe
the
daughter
of
his
brother
thomas
had
married
ivan
iii
of
russia
in
this
way
did
the
of
moscow
fall
heir
to
the
traditions
of
constantinople
the
of
old
byzantium
reminiscent
of
the
days
when
rome
had
been
divided
into
an
eastern
and
a
western
part
became
the
coat
of
arms
of
modern
russia
the
tsar
who
had
been
merely
the
first
of
the
russian
nobles
assumed
the
aloofness
and
the
dignity
of
a
roman
emperor
before
whom
all
subjects
both
high
and
low
were
inconsiderable
slaves
the
court
was
refashioned
after
the
oriental
pattern
which
the
eastern
emperors
had
imported
from
asia
and
from
egypt
and
which
so
they
flattered
themselves
resembled
the
court
of
alexander
the
great
this
strange
inheritance
which
the
dying
byzantine
empire
bequeathed
to
an
unsuspecting
world
continued
to
live
with
great
vigour
for
six
more
centuries
amidst
the
vast
plains
of
russia
the
last
man
to
wear
the
crown
with
the
double
eagle
of
constantinople
tsar
nicholas
was
murdered
only
the
other
day
so
to
speak
his
body
was
thrown
into
a
well
his
son
and
his
daughters
were
all
killed
all
his
ancient
rights
and
prerogatives
were
abolished
and
the
church
was
reduced
to
the
position
which
it
had
held
in
rome
before
the
days
of
constantine
the
eastern
church
however
fared
very
differently
as
we
shall
see
in
the
next
chapter
when
the
whole
christian
world
is
going
to
be
threatened
with
destruction
by
the
rival
creed
of
an
arab
mohammed
ahmed
the
who
became
the
prophet
of
the
arabian
desert
and
whose
followers
almost
conquered
the
entire
known
world
for
the
greater
glory
of
allah
the
only
true
god
since
the
days
of
carthage
and
hannibal
we
have
said
nothing
of
the
semitic
people
you
will
remember
how
they
filled
all
the
chapters
devoted
to
the
story
of
the
ancient
world
the
babylonians
the
assyrians
the
phoenicians
the
jews
the
arameans
the
chaldeans
all
of
them
semites
had
been
the
rulers
of
western
asia
for
thirty
or
forty
centuries
they
had
been
conquered
by
the
persians
who
had
come
from
the
east
and
by
the
greeks
who
had
come
from
the
west
a
hundred
years
after
the
death
of
alexander
the
great
carthage
a
colony
of
semitic
phoenicians
had
fought
the
romans
for
the
mastery
of
the
mediterranean
carthage
had
been
defeated
and
destroyed
and
for
eight
hundred
years
the
romans
had
been
masters
of
the
world
in
the
seventh
century
however
another
semitic
tribe
appeared
upon
the
scene
and
challenged
the
power
of
the
west
they
were
the
arabs
peaceful
shepherds
who
had
roamed
through
the
desert
since
the
beginning
of
time
without
showing
any
signs
of
imperial
ambitions
then
they
listened
to
mohammed
mounted
their
horses
and
in
less
than
a
century
they
had
pushed
to
the
heart
of
europe
and
proclaimed
the
glories
of
allah
the
only
god
and
mohammed
the
prophet
of
the
only
god
to
the
frightened
peasants
of
france
the
story
of
ahmed
the
son
of
abdallah
and
aminah
usually
known
as
mohammed
or
he
who
will
be
praised
reads
like
a
chapter
in
the
thousand
and
one
nights
he
was
a
born
in
mecca
he
seems
to
have
been
an
epileptic
and
he
suffered
from
spells
of
unconsciousness
when
he
dreamed
strange
dreams
and
heard
the
voice
of
the
angel
gabriel
whose
words
were
afterwards
written
down
in
a
book
called
the
koran
his
work
as
a
caravan
leader
carried
him
all
over
arabia
and
he
was
constantly
falling
in
with
jewish
merchants
and
with
christian
traders
and
he
came
to
see
that
the
worship
of
a
single
god
was
a
very
excellent
thing
his
own
people
the
arabs
still
revered
queer
stones
and
trunks
of
trees
as
their
ancestors
had
done
tens
of
thousands
of
years
before
in
mecca
their
holy
city
stood
a
little
square
building
the
kaaba
full
of
idols
and
strange
odds
and
ends
of
worship
mohammed
decided
to
be
the
moses
of
the
arab
people
he
could
not
well
be
a
prophet
and
a
at
the
same
time
so
he
made
himself
independent
by
marrying
his
employer
the
rich
widow
chadija
then
he
told
his
neighbours
in
mecca
that
he
was
the
prophet
sent
by
allah
to
save
the
world
the
neighbours
laughed
most
heartily
and
when
mohammed
continued
to
annoy
them
with
his
speeches
they
decided
to
kill
him
they
regarded
him
as
a
lunatic
and
a
public
bore
who
deserved
no
mercy
mohammed
heard
of
the
plot
and
in
the
dark
of
night
he
fled
to
medina
together
with
abu
bekr
his
trusted
pupil
this
happened
in
the
year
it
is
the
most
important
date
in
mohammedan
history
and
is
known
as
the
hegira
the
year
of
the
great
flight
in
medina
mohammed
who
was
a
stranger
found
it
easier
to
proclaim
himself
a
prophet
than
in
his
home
city
where
every
one
had
known
him
as
a
simple
soon
he
was
surrounded
by
an
increasing
number
of
followers
or
moslems
who
accepted
the
islam
the
submission
to
the
will
of
god
which
mohammed
praised
as
the
highest
of
all
virtues
for
seven
years
he
preached
to
the
people
of
medina
then
he
believed
himself
strong
enough
to
begin
a
campaign
against
his
former
neighbours
who
had
dared
to
sneer
at
him
and
his
holy
mission
in
his
old
days
at
the
head
of
an
army
of
medinese
he
marched
across
the
desert
his
followers
took
mecca
without
great
difficulty
and
having
slaughtered
a
number
of
the
inhabitants
they
found
it
quite
easy
to
convince
the
others
that
mohammed
was
really
a
great
prophet
from
that
time
on
until
the
year
of
his
death
mohammed
was
fortunate
in
everything
he
undertook
there
are
two
reasons
for
the
success
of
islam
in
the
first
place
the
creed
which
mohammed
taught
to
his
followers
was
very
simple
the
disciples
were
told
that
they
must
love
allah
the
ruler
of
the
world
the
merciful
and
compassionate
they
must
honour
and
obey
their
parents
they
were
warned
against
dishonesty
in
dealing
with
their
neighbours
and
were
admonished
to
be
humble
and
charitable
to
the
poor
and
to
the
sick
finally
they
were
ordered
to
abstain
from
strong
drink
and
to
be
very
frugal
in
what
they
ate
that
was
all
there
were
no
priests
who
acted
as
shepherds
of
their
flocks
and
asked
that
they
be
supported
at
the
common
expense
the
mohammedan
churches
or
mosques
were
merely
large
stone
halls
without
benches
or
pictures
where
the
faithful
could
gather
if
they
felt
so
inclined
to
read
and
discuss
chapters
from
the
koran
the
holy
book
but
the
average
mohammedan
carried
his
religion
with
him
and
never
felt
himself
hemmed
in
by
the
restrictions
and
regulations
of
an
established
church
five
times
a
day
he
turned
his
face
towards
mecca
the
holy
city
and
said
a
simple
prayer
for
the
rest
of
the
time
he
let
allah
rule
the
world
as
he
saw
fit
and
accepted
whatever
fate
brought
him
with
patient
resignation
of
course
such
an
attitude
towards
life
did
not
encourage
the
faithful
to
go
forth
and
invent
electrical
machinery
or
bother
about
railroads
and
steamship
lines
but
it
gave
every
mohammedan
a
certain
amount
of
contentment
it
bade
him
be
at
peace
with
himself
and
with
the
world
in
which
he
lived
and
that
was
a
very
good
thing
the
second
reason
which
explains
the
success
of
the
moslems
in
their
warfare
upon
the
christians
had
to
do
with
the
conduct
of
those
mohammedan
soldiers
who
went
forth
to
do
battle
for
the
true
faith
the
prophet
promised
that
those
who
fell
facing
the
enemy
would
go
directly
to
heaven
this
made
sudden
death
in
the
field
preferable
to
a
long
but
dreary
existence
upon
this
earth
it
gave
the
mohammedans
an
enormous
advantage
over
the
crusaders
who
were
in
constant
dread
of
a
dark
hereafter
and
who
stuck
to
the
good
things
of
this
world
as
long
as
they
possibly
could
incidentally
it
explains
why
even
moslem
soldiers
will
charge
into
the
fire
of
european
machine
guns
quite
indifferent
to
the
fate
that
awaits
them
and
why
they
are
such
dangerous
and
persistent
enemies
having
put
his
religious
house
in
order
mohammed
now
began
to
enjoy
his
power
as
the
undisputed
ruler
of
a
large
number
of
arab
tribes
but
success
has
been
the
undoing
of
a
large
number
of
men
who
were
great
in
the
days
of
adversity
he
tried
to
gain
the
good
will
of
the
rich
people
by
a
number
of
regulations
which
could
appeal
to
those
of
wealth
he
allowed
the
faithful
to
have
four
wives
as
one
wife
was
a
costly
investment
in
those
olden
days
when
brides
were
bought
directly
from
the
parents
four
wives
became
a
positive
luxury
except
to
those
who
possessed
camels
and
dromedaries
and
date
orchards
beyond
the
dreams
of
avarice
a
religion
which
at
first
had
been
meant
for
the
hardy
hunters
of
the
high
skied
desert
was
gradually
transformed
to
suit
the
needs
of
the
smug
merchants
who
lived
in
the
bazaars
of
the
cities
it
was
a
regrettable
change
from
the
original
program
and
it
did
very
little
good
to
the
cause
of
mohammedanism
as
for
the
prophet
himself
he
went
on
preaching
the
truth
of
allah
and
proclaiming
new
rules
of
conduct
until
he
died
quite
suddenly
of
a
fever
on
june
the
seventh
of
the
year
his
successor
as
caliph
or
leader
of
the
moslems
was
his
who
had
shared
the
early
dangers
of
the
prophet
life
two
years
later
died
and
omar
ibn
followed
him
in
less
than
ten
years
he
conquered
egypt
persia
phoenicia
syria
and
palestine
and
made
damascus
the
capital
of
the
first
mohammedan
world
empire
omar
was
succeeded
by
ali
the
husband
of
mohammed
daughter
fatima
but
a
quarrel
broke
out
upon
a
point
of
moslem
doctrine
and
ali
was
murdered
after
his
death
the
caliphate
was
made
hereditary
and
the
leaders
of
the
faithful
who
had
begun
their
career
as
the
spiritual
head
of
a
religious
sect
became
the
rulers
of
a
vast
empire
they
built
a
new
city
on
the
shores
of
the
euphrates
near
the
ruins
of
babylon
and
called
it
bagdad
and
organising
the
arab
horsemen
into
regiments
of
cavalry
they
set
forth
to
bring
the
happiness
of
their
moslem
faith
to
all
unbelievers
in
the
year
a
mohammedan
general
by
the
name
of
tarik
crossed
the
old
gates
of
hercules
and
reached
the
high
rock
on
the
european
side
which
he
called
the
the
hill
of
tarik
or
gibraltar
eleven
years
later
in
the
battle
of
xeres
de
la
frontera
he
defeated
the
king
of
the
visigoths
and
then
the
moslem
army
moved
northward
and
following
the
route
of
hannibal
they
crossed
the
passes
of
the
pyrenees
they
defeated
the
duke
of
aquitania
who
tried
to
halt
them
near
bordeaux
and
marched
upon
paris
but
in
the
year
one
hundred
years
after
the
death
of
the
prophet
they
were
beaten
in
a
battle
between
tours
and
poitiers
on
that
day
charles
martel
charles
with
the
hammer
the
frankish
chieftain
saved
europe
from
a
mohammedan
he
drove
the
moslems
out
of
france
but
they
maintained
themselves
in
spain
where
founded
the
caliphate
of
cordova
which
became
the
greatest
centre
of
science
and
art
of
mediaeval
europe
this
moorish
kingdom
because
the
people
came
from
mauretania
in
morocco
lasted
seven
centuries
it
was
only
after
the
capture
of
granada
the
last
moslem
stronghold
in
the
year
that
columbus
received
the
royal
grant
which
allowed
him
to
go
upon
a
voyage
of
discovery
the
mohammedans
soon
regained
their
strength
in
the
new
conquests
which
they
made
in
asia
and
africa
and
there
are
as
many
followers
of
mohammed
as
there
are
of
christ
charlemagne
how
charlemagne
the
king
of
the
franks
came
to
bear
the
title
of
emperor
and
tried
to
revive
the
old
ideal
of
the
battle
of
poitiers
had
saved
europe
from
the
mohammedans
but
the
enemy
within
the
hopeless
disorder
which
had
followed
the
disappearance
of
the
roman
police
officer
that
enemy
remained
it
is
true
that
the
new
converts
of
the
christian
faith
in
northern
europe
felt
a
deep
respect
for
the
mighty
bishop
of
rome
but
that
poor
bishop
did
not
feel
any
too
safe
when
he
looked
toward
the
distant
mountains
heaven
knew
what
fresh
hordes
of
barbarians
were
ready
to
cross
the
alps
and
begin
a
new
attack
on
rome
it
was
necessary
very
necessary
for
the
spiritual
head
of
the
world
to
find
an
ally
with
a
strong
sword
and
a
powerful
fist
who
was
willing
to
defend
his
holiness
in
case
of
danger
and
so
the
popes
who
were
not
only
very
holy
but
also
very
practical
cast
about
for
a
friend
and
presently
they
made
overtures
to
the
most
promising
of
the
germanic
tribes
who
had
occupied
europe
after
the
fall
of
rome
they
were
called
the
franks
one
of
their
earliest
kings
called
merovech
had
helped
the
romans
in
the
battle
of
the
catalaunian
fields
in
the
year
when
they
defeated
the
huns
his
descendants
the
merovingians
had
continued
to
take
little
bits
of
imperial
territory
until
the
year
when
king
clovis
the
old
french
word
for
louis
felt
himself
strong
enough
to
beat
the
romans
in
the
open
but
his
descendants
were
weak
men
who
left
the
affairs
of
state
to
their
prime
minister
the
major
domus
or
master
of
the
palace
pepin
the
short
the
son
of
the
famous
charles
martel
who
succeeded
his
father
as
master
of
the
palace
hardly
knew
how
to
handle
the
situation
his
royal
master
was
a
devout
theologian
without
any
interest
in
politics
pepin
asked
the
pope
for
advice
the
pope
who
was
a
practical
person
answered
that
the
power
in
the
state
belonged
to
him
who
was
actually
possessed
of
it
pepin
took
the
hint
he
persuaded
childeric
the
last
of
the
merovingians
to
become
a
monk
and
then
made
himself
king
with
the
approval
of
the
other
germanic
chieftains
but
this
did
not
satisfy
the
shrewd
pepin
he
wanted
to
be
something
more
than
a
barbarian
chieftain
he
staged
an
elaborate
ceremony
at
which
boniface
the
great
missionary
of
the
european
northwest
anointed
him
and
made
him
a
king
by
the
grace
of
god
it
was
easy
to
slip
those
words
del
gratia
into
the
coronation
service
it
took
almost
fifteen
hundred
years
to
get
them
out
again
pepin
was
sincerely
grateful
for
this
kindness
on
the
part
of
the
church
he
made
two
expeditions
to
italy
to
defend
the
pope
against
his
enemies
he
took
ravenna
and
several
other
cities
away
from
the
longobards
and
presented
them
to
his
holiness
who
incorporated
these
new
domains
into
the
papal
state
which
remained
an
independent
country
until
half
a
century
ago
after
pepin
death
the
relations
between
rome
and
or
nymwegen
or
ingelheim
the
frankish
kings
did
not
have
one
official
residence
but
travelled
from
place
to
place
with
all
their
ministers
and
court
officers
became
more
and
more
cordial
finally
the
pope
and
the
king
took
a
step
which
was
to
influence
the
history
of
europe
in
a
most
profound
way
charles
commonly
known
as
carolus
magnus
or
charlemagne
succeeded
pepin
in
the
year
he
had
conquered
the
land
of
the
saxons
in
eastern
germany
and
had
built
towns
and
monasteries
all
over
the
greater
part
of
northern
europe
at
the
request
of
certain
enemies
of
he
had
invaded
spain
to
fight
the
moors
but
in
the
pyrenees
he
had
been
attacked
by
the
wild
basques
and
had
been
forced
to
retire
it
was
upon
this
occasion
that
roland
the
great
margrave
of
breton
showed
what
a
frankish
chieftain
of
those
early
days
meant
when
he
promised
to
be
faithful
to
his
king
and
gave
his
life
and
that
of
his
trusted
followers
to
safeguard
the
retreat
of
the
royal
army
during
the
last
ten
years
of
the
eighth
century
however
charles
was
obliged
to
devote
himself
exclusively
to
affairs
of
the
south
the
pope
leo
iii
had
been
attacked
by
a
band
of
roman
rowdies
and
had
been
left
for
dead
in
the
street
some
kind
people
had
bandaged
his
wounds
and
had
helped
him
to
escape
to
the
camp
of
charles
where
he
asked
for
help
an
army
of
franks
soon
restored
quiet
and
carried
leo
back
to
the
lateran
palace
which
ever
since
the
days
of
constantine
had
been
the
home
of
the
pope
that
was
in
december
of
the
year
on
christmas
day
of
the
next
year
charlemagne
who
was
staying
in
rome
attended
the
service
in
the
ancient
church
of
peter
when
he
arose
from
prayer
the
pope
placed
a
crown
upon
his
head
called
him
emperor
of
the
romans
and
hailed
him
once
more
with
the
title
of
augustus
which
had
not
been
heard
for
hundreds
of
years
once
more
northern
europe
was
part
of
a
roman
empire
but
the
dignity
was
held
by
a
german
chieftain
who
could
read
just
a
little
and
never
learned
to
write
but
he
could
fight
and
for
a
short
while
there
was
order
and
even
the
rival
emperor
in
constantinople
sent
a
letter
of
approval
to
his
dear
brother
unfortunately
this
splendid
old
man
died
in
the
year
his
sons
and
his
grandsons
at
once
began
to
fight
for
the
largest
share
of
the
imperial
inheritance
twice
the
carolingian
lands
were
divided
by
the
treaties
of
verdun
in
the
year
and
by
the
treaty
of
in
the
year
the
latter
treaty
divided
the
entire
frankish
kingdom
into
two
parts
charles
the
bold
received
the
western
half
it
contained
the
old
roman
province
called
gaul
where
the
language
of
the
people
had
become
thoroughly
romanized
the
franks
soon
learned
to
speak
this
language
and
this
accounts
for
the
strange
fact
that
a
purely
germanic
land
like
france
should
speak
a
latin
tongue
the
other
grandson
got
the
eastern
part
the
land
which
the
romans
had
called
germania
those
inhospitable
regions
had
never
been
part
of
the
old
empire
augustus
had
tried
to
conquer
this
far
east
but
his
legions
had
been
annihilated
in
the
teutoburg
wood
in
the
year
and
the
people
had
never
been
influenced
by
the
higher
roman
civilisation
they
spoke
the
popular
germanic
tongue
the
teuton
word
for
people
was
thiot
the
christian
missionaries
therefore
called
the
german
language
the
lingua
theotisca
or
the
lingua
teutisca
the
popular
dialect
and
this
word
teutisca
was
changed
into
deutsch
which
accounts
for
the
name
deutschland
as
for
the
famous
imperial
crown
it
very
soon
slipped
off
the
heads
of
the
carolingian
successors
and
rolled
back
onto
the
italian
plain
where
it
became
a
sort
of
plaything
of
a
number
of
little
potentates
who
stole
the
crown
from
each
other
amidst
much
bloodshed
and
wore
it
with
or
without
the
permission
of
the
pope
until
it
was
the
turn
of
some
more
ambitious
neighbour
the
pope
once
more
sorely
beset
by
his
enemies
sent
north
for
help
he
did
not
appeal
to
the
ruler
of
the
kingdom
this
time
his
messengers
crossed
the
alps
and
addressed
themselves
to
otto
a
saxon
prince
who
was
recognised
as
the
greatest
chieftain
of
the
different
germanic
tribes
otto
who
shared
his
people
affection
for
the
blue
skies
and
the
gay
and
beautiful
people
of
the
italian
peninsula
hastened
to
the
rescue
in
return
for
his
services
the
pope
leo
viii
made
otto
emperor
and
the
eastern
half
of
charles
old
kingdom
was
henceforth
known
as
the
holy
roman
empire
of
the
german
nation
this
strange
political
creation
managed
to
live
to
the
ripe
old
age
of
eight
hundred
and
years
in
the
year
during
the
presidency
of
thomas
jefferson
it
was
most
unceremoniously
relegated
to
the
historical
scrapheap
the
brutal
fellow
who
destroyed
the
old
germanic
empire
was
the
son
of
a
corsican
who
had
made
a
brilliant
career
in
the
service
of
the
french
republic
he
was
ruler
of
europe
by
the
grace
of
his
famous
guard
regiments
but
he
desired
to
be
something
more
he
sent
to
rome
for
the
pope
and
the
pope
came
and
stood
by
while
general
napoleon
placed
the
imperial
crown
upon
his
own
head
and
proclaimed
himself
heir
to
the
tradition
of
charlemagne
for
history
is
like
life
the
more
things
change
the
more
they
remain
the
same
the
norsemen
why
the
people
of
the
tenth
century
prayed
the
lord
to
protect
them
from
the
fury
of
the
norsemen
in
the
third
and
fourth
centuries
the
germanic
tribes
of
central
europe
had
broken
through
the
defences
of
the
empire
that
they
might
plunder
rome
and
live
on
the
fat
of
the
land
in
the
eighth
century
it
became
the
turn
of
the
germans
to
be
the
they
did
not
like
this
at
all
even
if
their
enemies
were
their
first
cousins
the
norsemen
who
lived
in
denmark
and
sweden
and
norway
what
forced
these
hardy
sailors
to
turn
pirate
we
do
not
know
but
once
they
had
discovered
the
advantages
and
pleasures
of
a
buccaneering
career
there
was
no
one
who
could
stop
them
they
would
suddenly
descend
upon
a
peaceful
frankish
or
frisian
village
situated
on
the
mouth
of
a
river
they
would
kill
all
the
men
and
steal
all
the
women
then
they
would
sail
away
in
their
ships
and
when
the
soldiers
of
the
king
or
emperor
arrived
upon
the
scene
the
robbers
were
gone
and
nothing
remained
but
a
few
smouldering
ruins
during
the
days
of
disorder
which
followed
the
death
of
charlemagne
the
northmen
developed
great
activity
their
fleets
made
raids
upon
every
country
and
their
sailors
established
small
independent
kingdoms
along
the
coast
of
holland
and
france
and
england
and
germany
and
they
even
found
their
way
into
italy
the
northmen
were
very
intelligent
they
soon
learned
to
speak
the
language
of
their
subjects
and
gave
up
the
uncivilised
ways
of
the
early
vikings
or
who
had
been
very
picturesque
but
also
very
unwashed
and
terribly
cruel
early
in
the
tenth
century
a
viking
by
the
name
of
rollo
had
repeatedly
attacked
the
coast
of
france
the
king
of
france
too
weak
to
resist
these
northern
robbers
tried
to
bribe
them
into
being
good
he
offered
them
the
province
of
normandy
if
they
would
promise
to
stop
bothering
the
rest
of
his
domains
rollo
accepted
this
bargain
and
became
duke
of
normandy
but
the
passion
of
conquest
was
strong
in
the
blood
of
his
children
across
the
channel
only
a
few
hours
away
from
the
european
mainland
they
could
see
the
white
cliffs
and
the
green
fields
of
england
poor
england
had
passed
through
difficult
days
for
two
hundred
years
it
had
been
a
roman
colony
after
the
romans
left
it
had
been
conquered
by
the
angles
and
the
saxons
two
german
tribes
from
schleswig
next
the
danes
had
taken
the
greater
part
of
the
country
and
had
established
the
kingdom
of
cnut
the
danes
had
been
driven
away
and
now
it
was
early
in
the
eleventh
century
another
saxon
king
edward
the
confessor
was
on
the
throne
but
edward
was
not
expected
to
live
long
and
he
had
no
children
the
circumstances
favoured
the
ambitious
dukes
of
normandy
in
edward
died
immediately
william
of
normandy
crossed
the
channel
defeated
and
killed
harold
of
wessex
who
had
taken
the
crown
at
the
battle
of
hastings
and
proclaimed
himself
king
of
england
in
another
chapter
i
have
told
you
how
in
the
year
a
german
chieftain
had
become
a
roman
emperor
now
in
the
year
the
grandson
of
a
norse
pirate
was
recognised
as
king
of
england
why
should
we
ever
read
fairy
stories
when
the
truth
of
history
is
so
much
more
interesting
and
entertaining
feudalism
how
central
europe
attacked
from
three
sides
became
an
armed
camp
and
why
europe
would
have
perished
without
those
professional
soldiers
and
administrators
who
were
part
of
the
feudal
system
the
following
then
is
the
state
of
europe
in
the
year
one
thousand
when
most
people
were
so
unhappy
that
they
welcomed
the
prophecy
foretelling
the
approaching
end
of
the
world
and
rushed
to
the
monasteries
that
the
day
of
judgement
might
find
them
engaged
upon
devout
duties
at
an
unknown
date
the
germanic
tribes
had
left
their
old
home
in
asia
and
had
moved
westward
into
europe
by
sheer
pressure
of
numbers
they
had
forced
their
way
into
the
roman
empire
they
had
destroyed
the
great
western
empire
but
the
eastern
part
being
off
the
main
route
of
the
great
migrations
had
managed
to
survive
and
feebly
continued
the
traditions
of
rome
ancient
glory
during
the
days
of
disorder
which
had
followed
the
true
dark
ages
of
history
the
sixth
and
seventh
centuries
of
our
era
the
german
tribes
had
been
persuaded
to
accept
the
christian
religion
and
had
recognised
the
bishop
of
rome
as
the
pope
or
spiritual
head
of
the
world
in
the
ninth
century
the
organising
genius
of
charlemagne
had
revived
the
roman
empire
and
had
united
the
greater
part
of
western
europe
into
a
single
state
during
the
tenth
century
this
empire
had
gone
to
pieces
the
western
part
had
become
a
separate
kingdom
france
the
eastern
half
was
known
as
the
holy
roman
empire
of
the
german
nation
and
the
rulers
of
this
federation
of
states
then
pretended
that
they
were
the
direct
heirs
of
caesar
and
augustus
unfortunately
the
power
of
the
kings
of
france
did
not
stretch
beyond
the
moat
of
their
royal
residence
while
the
holy
roman
emperor
was
openly
defied
by
his
powerful
subjects
whenever
it
suited
their
fancy
or
their
profit
to
increase
the
misery
of
the
masses
of
the
people
the
triangle
of
western
europe
look
at
page
please
was
for
ever
exposed
to
attacks
from
three
sides
on
the
south
lived
the
ever
dangerous
mohammedans
the
western
coast
was
ravaged
by
the
northmen
the
eastern
frontier
defenceless
except
for
the
short
stretch
of
the
carpathian
mountains
was
at
the
mercy
of
hordes
of
huns
hungarians
slavs
and
tartars
the
peace
of
rome
was
a
thing
of
the
remote
past
a
dream
of
the
good
old
days
that
were
gone
for
ever
it
was
a
question
of
fight
or
die
and
quite
naturally
people
preferred
to
fight
forced
by
circumstances
europe
became
an
armed
camp
and
there
was
a
demand
for
strong
leadership
both
king
and
emperor
were
far
away
the
frontiersmen
and
most
of
europe
in
the
year
was
frontier
must
help
themselves
they
willingly
submitted
to
the
representatives
of
the
king
who
were
sent
to
administer
the
outlying
districts
provided
they
could
protect
them
against
their
enemies
soon
central
europe
was
dotted
with
small
principalities
each
one
ruled
by
a
duke
or
a
count
or
a
baron
or
a
bishop
as
the
case
might
be
and
organised
as
a
fighting
unit
these
dukes
and
counts
and
barons
had
sworn
to
be
faithful
to
the
king
who
had
given
them
their
feudum
hence
our
word
feudal
in
return
for
their
loyal
services
and
a
certain
amount
of
taxes
but
travel
in
those
days
was
slow
and
the
means
of
communication
were
exceedingly
poor
the
royal
or
imperial
administrators
therefore
enjoyed
great
independence
and
within
the
boundaries
of
their
own
province
they
assumed
most
of
the
rights
which
in
truth
belonged
to
the
king
but
you
would
make
a
mistake
if
you
supposed
that
the
people
of
the
eleventh
century
objected
to
this
form
of
government
they
supported
feudalism
because
it
was
a
very
practical
and
necessary
institution
their
lord
and
master
usually
lived
in
a
big
stone
house
erected
on
the
top
of
a
steep
rock
or
built
between
deep
moats
but
within
sight
of
his
subjects
in
case
of
danger
the
subjects
found
shelter
behind
the
walls
of
the
baronial
stronghold
that
is
why
they
tried
to
live
as
near
the
castle
as
possible
and
it
accounts
for
the
many
european
cities
which
began
their
career
around
a
feudal
fortress
but
the
knight
of
the
early
middle
ages
was
much
more
than
a
professional
soldier
he
was
the
civil
servant
of
that
day
he
was
the
judge
of
his
community
and
he
was
the
chief
of
police
he
caught
the
highwaymen
and
protected
the
wandering
pedlars
who
were
the
merchants
of
the
eleventh
century
he
looked
after
the
dikes
so
that
the
countryside
should
not
be
flooded
just
as
the
first
noblemen
had
done
in
the
valley
of
the
nile
four
thousand
years
before
he
encouraged
the
troubadours
who
wandered
from
place
to
place
telling
the
stories
of
the
ancient
heroes
who
had
fought
in
the
great
wars
of
the
migrations
besides
he
protected
the
churches
and
the
monasteries
within
his
territory
and
although
he
could
neither
read
nor
write
it
was
considered
unmanly
to
know
such
things
he
employed
a
number
of
priests
who
kept
his
accounts
and
who
registered
the
marriages
and
the
births
and
the
deaths
which
occurred
within
the
baronial
or
ducal
domains
in
the
fifteenth
century
the
kings
once
more
became
strong
enough
to
exercise
those
powers
which
belonged
to
them
because
they
were
anointed
of
god
then
the
feudal
knights
lost
their
former
independence
reduced
to
the
rank
of
country
squires
they
no
longer
filled
a
need
and
soon
they
became
a
nuisance
but
europe
would
have
perished
without
the
feudal
system
of
the
dark
ages
there
were
many
bad
knights
as
there
are
many
bad
people
but
generally
speaking
the
barons
of
the
twelfth
and
thirteenth
century
were
administrators
who
rendered
a
most
useful
service
to
the
cause
of
progress
during
that
era
the
noble
torch
of
learning
and
art
which
had
illuminated
the
world
of
the
egyptians
and
the
greeks
and
the
romans
was
burning
very
low
without
the
knights
and
their
good
friends
the
monks
civilisation
would
have
been
extinguished
entirely
and
the
human
race
would
have
been
forced
to
begin
once
more
where
the
had
left
off
chivalry
chivalry
it
was
quite
natural
that
the
professional
of
the
middle
ages
should
try
to
establish
some
sort
of
organisation
for
their
mutual
benefit
and
protection
out
of
this
need
for
close
organisation
knighthood
or
chivalry
was
born
we
know
very
little
about
the
origins
of
knighthood
but
as
the
system
developed
it
gave
the
world
something
which
it
needed
very
badly
a
definite
rule
of
conduct
which
softened
the
barbarous
customs
of
that
day
and
made
life
more
livable
than
it
had
been
during
the
five
hundred
years
of
the
dark
ages
it
was
not
an
easy
task
to
civilise
the
rough
frontiersmen
who
had
spent
most
of
their
time
fighting
mohammedans
and
huns
and
norsemen
often
they
were
guilty
of
backsliding
and
having
vowed
all
sorts
of
oaths
about
mercy
and
charity
in
the
morning
they
would
murder
all
their
prisoners
before
evening
but
progress
is
ever
the
result
of
slow
and
ceaseless
labour
and
finally
the
most
unscrupulous
of
knights
was
forced
to
obey
the
rules
of
his
class
or
suffer
the
consequences
these
rules
were
different
in
the
various
parts
of
europe
but
they
all
made
much
of
service
and
loyalty
to
duty
the
middle
ages
regarded
service
as
something
very
noble
and
beautiful
it
was
no
disgrace
to
be
a
servant
provided
you
were
a
good
servant
and
did
not
slacken
on
the
job
as
for
loyalty
at
a
time
when
life
depended
upon
the
faithful
of
many
unpleasant
duties
it
was
the
chief
virtue
of
the
fighting
man
a
young
knight
therefore
was
asked
to
swear
that
he
would
be
faithful
as
a
servant
to
god
and
as
a
servant
to
his
king
furthermore
he
promised
to
be
generous
to
those
whose
need
was
greater
than
his
own
he
pledged
his
word
that
he
would
be
humble
in
his
personal
behaviour
and
would
never
boast
of
his
own
accomplishments
and
that
he
would
be
a
friend
of
all
those
who
suffered
with
the
exception
of
the
mohammedans
whom
he
was
expected
to
kill
on
sight
around
these
vows
which
were
merely
the
ten
commandments
expressed
in
terms
which
the
people
of
the
middle
ages
could
understand
there
developed
a
complicated
system
of
manners
and
outward
behaviour
the
knights
tried
to
model
their
own
lives
after
the
example
of
those
heroes
of
arthur
round
table
and
charlemagne
court
of
whom
the
troubadours
had
told
them
and
of
whom
you
may
read
in
many
delightful
books
which
are
enumerated
at
the
end
of
this
volume
they
hoped
that
they
might
prove
as
brave
as
lancelot
and
as
faithful
as
roland
they
carried
themselves
with
dignity
and
they
spoke
careful
and
gracious
words
that
they
might
be
known
as
true
knights
however
humble
the
cut
of
their
coat
or
the
size
of
their
purse
in
this
way
the
order
of
knighthood
became
a
school
of
those
good
manners
which
are
the
oil
of
the
social
machinery
chivalry
came
to
mean
courtesy
and
the
feudal
castle
showed
the
rest
of
the
world
what
clothes
to
wear
how
to
eat
how
to
ask
a
lady
for
a
dance
and
the
thousand
and
one
little
things
of
behaviour
which
help
to
make
life
interesting
and
agreeable
like
all
human
institutions
knighthood
was
doomed
to
perish
as
soon
as
it
had
outlived
its
usefulness
the
crusades
about
which
one
of
the
next
chapters
tells
were
followed
by
a
great
revival
of
trade
cities
grew
overnight
the
townspeople
became
rich
hired
good
school
teachers
and
soon
were
the
equals
of
the
knights
the
invention
of
deprived
the
heavily
armed
chevalier
of
his
former
advantage
and
the
use
of
mercenaries
made
it
impossible
to
conduct
a
battle
with
the
delicate
niceties
of
a
chess
tournament
the
knight
became
superfluous
soon
he
became
a
ridiculous
figure
with
his
devotion
to
ideals
that
had
no
longer
any
practical
value
it
was
said
that
the
noble
don
quixote
de
la
mancha
had
been
the
last
of
the
true
knights
after
his
death
his
trusted
sword
and
his
armour
were
sold
to
pay
his
debts
but
somehow
or
other
that
sword
seems
to
have
fallen
into
the
hands
of
a
number
of
men
washington
carried
it
during
the
hopeless
days
of
valley
forge
it
was
the
only
defence
of
gordon
when
he
had
refused
to
desert
the
people
who
had
been
entrusted
to
his
care
and
stayed
to
meet
his
death
in
the
besieged
fortress
of
khartoum
and
i
am
not
quite
sure
but
that
it
proved
of
invaluable
strength
in
winning
the
great
war
pope
emperor
the
strange
double
loyalty
of
the
people
of
the
middle
ages
and
how
it
led
to
endless
quarrels
between
the
popes
and
the
holy
roman
emperors
it
is
very
difficult
to
understand
the
people
of
ages
your
own
grandfather
whom
you
see
every
day
is
a
mysterious
being
who
lives
in
a
different
world
of
ideas
and
clothes
and
manners
i
am
now
telling
you
the
story
of
some
of
your
grandfathers
who
are
generations
removed
and
i
do
not
expect
you
to
catch
the
meaning
of
what
i
write
without
this
chapter
a
number
of
times
the
average
man
of
the
middle
ages
lived
a
very
simple
and
uneventful
life
even
if
he
was
a
free
citizen
able
to
come
and
go
at
will
he
rarely
left
his
own
neighbourhood
there
were
no
printed
books
and
only
a
few
manuscripts
here
and
there
a
small
band
of
industrious
monks
taught
reading
and
writing
and
some
arithmetic
but
science
and
history
and
geography
lay
buried
beneath
the
ruins
of
greece
and
rome
whatever
people
knew
about
the
past
they
had
learned
by
listening
to
stories
and
legends
such
information
which
goes
from
father
to
son
is
often
slightly
incorrect
in
details
but
it
will
preserve
the
main
facts
of
history
with
astonishing
accuracy
after
more
than
two
thousand
years
the
mothers
of
india
still
frighten
their
naughty
children
by
telling
them
that
iskander
will
get
them
and
iskander
is
none
other
than
alexander
the
great
who
visited
india
in
the
year
before
the
birth
of
christ
but
whose
story
has
lived
through
all
these
ages
the
people
of
the
early
middle
ages
never
saw
a
textbook
of
roman
history
they
were
ignorant
of
many
things
which
every
knows
before
he
has
entered
the
third
grade
but
the
roman
empire
which
is
merely
a
name
to
you
was
to
them
something
very
much
alive
they
felt
it
they
willingly
recognised
the
pope
as
their
spiritual
leader
because
he
lived
in
rome
and
represented
the
idea
of
the
roman
and
they
were
profoundly
grateful
when
charlemagne
and
afterwards
otto
the
great
revived
the
idea
of
a
and
created
the
holy
roman
empire
that
the
world
might
again
be
as
it
always
had
been
but
the
fact
that
there
were
two
different
heirs
to
the
roman
tradition
placed
the
faithful
burghers
of
the
middle
ages
in
a
difficult
position
the
theory
behind
the
mediaeval
political
system
was
both
sound
and
simple
while
the
worldly
master
the
emperor
looked
after
the
physical
of
his
subjects
the
spiritual
master
the
pope
guarded
their
souls
in
practice
however
the
system
worked
very
badly
the
emperor
invariably
tried
to
interfere
with
the
affairs
of
the
church
and
the
pope
retaliated
and
told
the
emperor
how
he
should
rule
his
domains
then
they
told
each
other
to
mind
their
own
business
in
very
unceremonious
language
and
the
inevitable
end
was
war
under
those
circumstances
what
were
the
people
to
do
a
good
christian
obeyed
both
the
pope
and
his
king
but
the
pope
and
the
emperor
were
enemies
which
side
should
a
dutiful
subject
and
an
equally
dutiful
christian
take
it
was
never
easy
to
give
the
correct
answer
when
the
emperor
happened
to
be
a
man
of
energy
and
was
sufficiently
well
provided
with
money
to
organise
an
army
he
was
very
apt
to
cross
the
alps
and
march
on
rome
besiege
the
pope
in
his
own
palace
if
need
be
and
force
his
holiness
to
obey
the
imperial
instructions
or
suffer
the
consequences
but
more
frequently
the
pope
was
the
stronger
then
the
emperor
or
the
king
together
with
all
his
subjects
was
excommunicated
this
meant
that
all
churches
were
closed
that
no
one
could
be
baptised
that
no
dying
man
could
be
given
absolution
in
short
that
half
of
the
functions
of
mediaeval
government
came
to
an
end
more
than
that
the
people
were
absolved
from
their
oath
of
loyalty
to
their
sovereign
and
were
urged
to
rebel
against
their
master
but
if
they
followed
this
advice
of
the
distant
pope
and
were
caught
they
were
hanged
by
their
lege
lord
and
that
too
was
very
unpleasant
indeed
the
poor
fellows
were
in
a
difficult
position
and
none
fared
worse
than
those
who
lived
during
the
latter
half
of
the
eleventh
century
when
the
emperor
henry
iv
of
germany
and
pope
gregory
vii
fought
a
battle
which
decided
nothing
and
upset
the
peace
of
europe
for
almost
fifty
years
in
the
middle
of
the
eleventh
century
there
had
been
a
strong
movement
for
reform
in
the
church
the
election
of
the
popes
thus
far
had
been
a
most
irregular
affair
it
was
to
the
advantage
of
the
holy
roman
emperors
to
have
a
priest
elected
to
the
holy
see
they
frequently
came
to
rome
at
the
time
of
election
and
used
their
influence
for
the
benefit
of
one
of
their
friends
in
the
year
this
had
been
changed
by
a
decree
of
pope
nicholas
ii
the
principal
priests
and
deacons
of
the
churches
in
and
around
rome
were
organised
into
the
college
of
cardinals
and
this
gathering
of
prominent
churchmen
the
word
cardinal
meant
principal
was
given
the
exclusive
power
of
electing
the
future
popes
in
the
year
the
college
of
cardinals
elected
a
priest
by
the
name
of
hildebrand
the
son
of
very
simple
parents
in
tuscany
as
pope
and
he
took
the
name
of
gregory
vii
his
energy
was
unbounded
his
belief
in
the
supreme
powers
of
his
holy
office
was
built
upon
a
granite
rock
of
conviction
and
courage
in
the
mind
of
gregory
the
pope
was
not
only
the
absolute
head
of
the
christian
church
but
also
the
highest
court
of
appeal
in
all
worldly
matters
the
pope
who
had
elevated
simple
german
princes
to
the
dignity
of
emperor
could
depose
them
at
will
he
could
veto
any
law
passed
by
duke
or
king
or
emperor
but
whosoever
should
question
a
papal
decree
let
him
beware
for
the
punishment
would
be
swift
and
merciless
gregory
sent
ambassadors
to
all
the
european
courts
to
inform
the
potentates
of
europe
of
his
new
laws
and
asked
them
to
take
due
notice
of
their
contents
william
the
conqueror
promised
to
be
good
but
henry
iv
who
since
the
age
of
six
had
been
fighting
with
his
subjects
had
no
intention
of
submitting
to
the
papal
will
he
called
together
a
college
of
german
bishops
accused
gregory
of
every
crime
under
the
sun
and
then
had
him
deposed
by
the
council
of
worms
the
pope
answered
with
excommunication
and
a
demand
that
the
german
princes
rid
themselves
of
their
unworthy
ruler
the
german
princes
only
too
happy
to
be
rid
of
henry
asked
the
pope
to
come
to
augsburg
and
help
them
elect
a
new
emperor
gregory
left
rome
and
travelled
northward
henry
who
was
no
fool
appreciated
the
danger
of
his
position
at
all
costs
he
must
make
peace
with
the
pope
and
he
must
do
it
at
once
in
the
midst
of
winter
he
crossed
the
alps
and
hastened
to
canossa
where
the
pope
had
stopped
for
a
short
rest
three
long
days
from
the
to
the
of
january
of
the
year
henry
dressed
as
a
penitent
pilgrim
but
with
a
warm
sweater
underneath
his
monkish
garb
waited
outside
the
gates
of
the
castle
of
canossa
then
he
was
allowed
to
enter
and
was
pardoned
for
his
sins
but
the
repentance
did
not
last
long
as
soon
as
henry
had
returned
to
germany
he
behaved
exactly
as
before
again
he
was
excommunicated
for
the
second
time
a
council
of
german
bishops
deposed
gregory
but
this
time
when
henry
crossed
the
alps
he
was
at
the
head
of
a
large
army
besieged
rome
and
forced
gregory
to
retire
to
salerno
where
he
died
in
exile
this
first
violent
outbreak
decided
nothing
as
soon
as
henry
was
back
in
germany
the
struggle
between
pope
and
emperor
was
continued
the
hohenstaufen
family
which
got
hold
of
the
imperial
german
throne
shortly
afterwards
were
even
more
independent
than
their
predecessors
gregory
had
claimed
that
the
popes
were
superior
to
all
kings
because
they
the
popes
at
the
day
of
judgement
would
be
responsible
for
the
behaviour
of
all
the
sheep
of
their
flock
and
in
the
eyes
of
god
a
king
was
one
of
that
faithful
herd
frederick
of
hohenstaufen
commonly
known
as
barbarossa
or
red
beard
set
up
the
that
the
empire
had
been
bestowed
upon
his
predecessor
by
god
himself
and
as
the
empire
included
italy
and
rome
he
began
a
campaign
which
was
to
add
these
lost
provinces
to
the
northern
country
barbarossa
was
accidentally
drowned
in
asia
minor
during
the
second
crusade
but
his
son
frederick
ii
a
brilliant
young
man
who
in
his
youth
had
been
exposed
to
the
civilisation
of
the
mohammedans
of
sicily
continued
the
war
the
popes
accused
him
of
heresy
it
is
true
that
frederick
seems
to
have
felt
a
deep
and
serious
contempt
for
the
rough
christian
world
of
the
north
for
the
boorish
german
knights
and
the
intriguing
italian
priests
but
he
held
his
tongue
went
on
a
crusade
and
took
jerusalem
from
the
infidel
and
was
duly
crowned
as
king
of
the
holy
city
even
this
act
did
not
placate
the
popes
they
deposed
frederick
and
gave
his
italian
possessions
to
charles
of
anjou
the
brother
of
that
king
louis
of
france
who
became
famous
as
saint
louis
this
led
to
more
warfare
conrad
v
the
son
of
conrad
iv
and
the
last
of
the
hohenstaufens
tried
to
regain
the
kingdom
and
was
defeated
and
decapitated
at
naples
but
twenty
years
later
the
french
who
had
made
themselves
thoroughly
unpopular
in
sicily
were
all
murdered
during
the
sicilian
vespers
and
so
it
went
the
quarrel
between
the
popes
and
the
emperors
was
never
settled
but
after
a
while
the
two
enemies
learned
to
leave
each
other
alone
in
the
year
rudolph
of
hapsburg
was
elected
emperor
he
did
not
take
the
trouble
to
go
to
rome
to
be
crowned
the
popes
did
not
object
and
in
turn
they
kept
away
from
germany
this
meant
peace
but
two
entire
centuries
which
might
have
been
used
for
the
purpose
of
internal
organisation
had
been
wasted
in
useless
warfare
it
is
an
ill
wind
however
that
bloweth
no
good
to
some
one
the
little
cities
of
italy
by
a
process
of
careful
balancing
had
managed
to
increase
their
power
and
their
independence
at
the
expense
of
both
emperors
and
popes
when
the
rush
for
the
holy
land
began
they
were
able
to
handle
the
transportation
problem
of
the
thousands
of
eager
pilgrims
who
were
clamoring
for
passage
and
at
the
end
of
the
crusades
they
had
built
themselves
such
strong
defences
of
brick
and
of
gold
that
they
could
defy
pope
and
emperor
with
equal
indifference
church
and
state
fought
each
other
and
a
third
party
the
mediaeval
city
ran
away
with
the
spoils
the
crusades
but
all
these
different
quarrels
were
forgotten
when
the
turks
took
the
holy
land
desecrated
the
holy
places
and
interfered
seriously
with
the
trade
from
east
to
west
europe
went
crusading
during
three
centuries
there
had
been
peace
between
christians
and
moslems
except
in
spain
and
in
the
eastern

of
europe
the
mohammedans
having
conquered
syria
in
the
seventh
century
were
in
possession
of
the
holy
land
but
they
regarded
jesus
as
a
great
prophet
though
not
quite
as
great
as
mohammed
and
they
did
not
interfere
with
the
pilgrims
who
wished
to
pray
in
the
church
which
saint
helena
the
mother
of
the
emperor
constantine
had
built
on
the
spot
of
the
holy
grave
but
early
in
the
eleventh
century
a
tartar
tribe
from
the
wilds
of
asia
called
the
seljuks
or
turks
became
masters
of
the
mohammedan
state
in
western
asia
and
then
the
period
of
tolerance
came
to
an
end
the
turks
took
all
of
asia
minor
away
from
the
eastern
roman
emperors
and
they
made
an
end
to
the
trade
between
east
and
west
alexis
the
emperor
who
rarely
saw
anything
of
his
christian
neighbours
of
the
west
appealed
for
help
and
pointed
to
the
danger
which
threatened
europe
should
the
turks
take
constantinople
the
italian
cities
which
had
established
colonies
along
the
coast
of

in
fear
for

reported

of

frenchman
from

who
had
been

at
the

famous
cloister
of

which
had
trained

thought
that
the
time
had
come
for
action
the
general
state
of
europe
was
far
from
satisfactory
the
primitive
agricultural
methods
of
that
day
unchanged
since
roman
times
caused
a
constant
scarcity
of
food
there
was
unemployment
and
hunger
and
these
are
apt
to
lead
to
discontent
and
riots
western
asia
in
older
days
had
fed
millions
it
was
an
excellent
field
for
the
purpose
of
immigration
therefore
at
the
council
of
clermont
in
france
in
the
year
the
pope
arose
described
the
terrible
horrors
which
the
infidels
had
inflicted
upon
the
holy
land
gave
a
glowing
description
of
this
country
which
ever
since
the
days
of
moses
had
been
overflowing
with
milk
and
honey
and
exhorted
the
knights
of
france
and
the
people
of
europe
in
general
to
leave
wife
and
child
and
deliver
palestine
from
the
turks
a
wave
of
religious
hysteria
swept
across
the
continent
all
reason
stopped
men
would
drop
their
hammer
and
saw
walk
out
of
their
shop
and
take
the
nearest
road
to
the
east
to
go
and
kill
turks
children
would
leave
their
homes
to
go
to
palestine
and
bring
the
terrible
turks
to
their
knees
by
the
mere
appeal
of
their
youthful
zeal
and
christian
piety
fully
ninety
percent
of
those
enthusiasts
never
got
within
sight
of
the
holy
land
they
had
no
money
they
were
forced
to
beg
or
steal
to
keep
alive
they
became
a
danger
to
the
safety
of
the
highroads
and
they
were
killed
by
the
angry
country
people
the
first
crusade
a
wild
mob
of
honest
christians
defaulting
bankrupts
penniless
noblemen
and
fugitives
from
justice
following
the
lead
of
peter
the
hermit
and
began
their
campaign
against
the
infidels
by
murdering
all
the
jews
whom
they
met
by
the
way
they
got
as
far
as
hungary
and
then
they
were
all
killed
this
experience
taught
the
church
a
lesson
enthusiasm
alone
would
not
set
the
holy
land
free
organisation
was
as
necessary
as
and
courage
a
year
was
spent
in
training
and
equipping
an
army
of
men
they
were
placed
under
command
of
godfrey
of
bouillon
robert
duke
of
normandy
robert
count
of
flanders
and
a
number
of
other
noblemen
all
experienced
in
the
art
of
war
in
the
year
this
second
crusade
started
upon
its
long
voyage
at
constantinople
the
knights
did
homage
to
the
emperor
for
as
i
have
told
you
traditions
die
hard
and
a
roman
emperor
however
poor
and
powerless
was
still
held
in
great
respect
then
they
crossed
into
asia
killed
all
the
moslems
who
fell
into
their
hands
stormed
jerusalem
massacred
the
mohammedan
population
and
marched
to
the
holy
sepulchre
to
give
praise
and
thanks
amidst
tears
of
piety
and
gratitude
but
soon
the
turks
were
strengthened
by
the
arrival
of
fresh
troops
then
they
retook
jerusalem
and
in
turn
killed
the
faithful
followers
of
the
cross
during
the
next
two
centuries
seven
other
crusades
took
place
gradually
the
crusaders
learned
the
technique
of
the
trip
the
land
voyage
was
too
tedious
and
too
dangerous
they
preferred
to
cross
the
alps
and
go
to
genoa
or
venice
where
they
took
ship
for
the
east
the
genoese
and
the
venetians
made
this
passenger
service
a
very
profitable
business
they
charged
exorbitant
rates
and
when
the
crusaders
most
of
whom
had
very
little
money
could
not
pay
the
price
these
italian
profiteers
kindly
allowed
them
to
work
their
way
across
in
return
for
a
fare
from
venice
to
acre
the
crusader
undertook
to
do
a
stated
amount
of
fighting
for
the
owners
of
his
vessel
in
this
way
venice
greatly
increased
her
territory
along
the
coast
of
the
adriatic
and
in
greece
where
athens
became
a
venetian
colony
and
in
the
islands
of
cyprus
and
crete
and
rhodes
all
this
however
helped
little
in
settling
the
question
of
the
holy
land
after
the
first
enthusiasm
had
worn
off
a
short
crusading
trip
became
part
of
the
liberal
education
of
every
young
man
and
there
never
was
any
lack
of
candidates
for
service
in
palestine
but
the
old
zeal
was
gone
the
crusaders
who
had
begun
their
warfare
with
deep
hatred
for
the
mohammedans
and
great
love
for
the
christian
people
of
the
eastern
roman
empire
and
armenia
suffered
a
complete
change
of
heart
they
came
to
despise
the
greeks
of
byzantium
who
cheated
them
and
frequently
betrayed
the
cause
of
the
cross
and
the
armenians
and
all
the
other
levantine
races
and
they
began
to
appreciate
the
virtues
of
their
enemies
who
proved
to
be
generous
and
fair
opponents
of
course
it
would
never
do
to
say
this
openly
but
when
the
crusader
returned
home
he
was
likely
to
imitate
the
manners
which
he
had
learned
from
his
heathenish
foe
compared
to
whom
the
average
western
knight
was
still
a
good
deal
of
a
country
bumpkin
he
also
brought
with
him
several
new
such
as
peaches
and
spinach
which
he
planted
in
his
garden
and
grew
for
his
own
benefit
he
gave
up
the
barbarous
custom
of
wearing
a
load
of
heavy
armour
and
appeared
in
the
flowing
robes
of
silk
or
cotton
which
were
the
traditional
habit
of
the
followers
of
the
prophet
and
were
originally
worn
by
the
turks
indeed
the
crusades
which
had
begun
as
a
punitive
expedition
against
the
heathen
became
a
course
of
general
instruction
in
civilisation
for
millions
of
young
europeans
from
a
military
and
political
point
of
view
the
crusades
were
a
failure
jerusalem
and
a
number
of
cities
were
taken
and
lost
a
dozen
little
kingdoms
were
established
in
syria
and
palestine
and
asia
minor
but
they
were
by
the
turks
and
after
the
year
when
jerusalem
became
definitely
turkish
the
status
of
the
holy
land
was
the
same
as
it
had
been
before
but
europe
had
undergone
a
great
change
the
people
of
the
west
had
been
allowed
a
glimpse
of
the
light
and
the
sunshine
and
the
beauty
of
the
east
their
dreary
castles
no
longer
satisfied
them
they
wanted
a
broader
life
neither
church
nor
state
could
give
this
to
them
they
found
it
in
the
cities
the
mediaeval
city
why
the
people
of
the
middle
ages
said
that
city
air
is
free
air
the
early
part
of
the
middle
ages
had
been
an
era
of
pioneering
and
of
settlement
a
new
people
who
thus
far
had
lived
outside
the
wild
range
of
forest
mountains
and
marshes
which
protected
the
frontier
of
the
roman
empire
had
forced
its
way
into
the
plains
of
western
europe
and
had
taken
possession
of
most
of
the
land
they
were
restless
as
all
pioneers
have
been
since
the
beginning
of
time
they
liked
to
be
on
the
go
they
cut
down
the
forests
and
they
cut
each
other
throats
with
equal
energy
few
of
them
wanted
to
live
in
cities
they
insisted
upon
being
free
they
loved
to
feel
the
fresh
air
of
the
hillsides
fill
their
lungs
while
they
drove
their
herds
across
the
pastures
when
they
no
longer
liked
their
old
homes
they
pulled
up
stakes
and
went
away
in
search
of
fresh
adventures
the
weaker
ones
died
the
hardy
fighters
and
the
courageous
women
who
had
followed
their
men
into
the
wilderness
survived
in
this
way
they
developed
a
strong
race
of
men
they
cared
little
for
the
graces
of
life
they
were
too
busy
to
play
the
fiddle
or
write
pieces
of
poetry
they
had
little
love
for
discussions
the
priest
the
learned
man
of
the
village
and
before
the
middle
of
the
thirteenth
century
a
layman
who
could
read
and
write
was
regarded
as
a
sissy
was
supposed
to
settle
all
questions
which
had
no
direct
practical
value
meanwhile
the
german
chieftain
the
frankish
baron
the
northman
duke
or
whatever
their
names
and
titles
occupied
their
share
of
the
territory
which
once
had
been
part
of
the
great
roman
empire
and
among
the
ruins
of
past
glory
they
built
a
world
of
their
own
which
pleased
them
mightily
and
which
they
considered
quite
perfect
they
managed
the
affairs
of
their
castle
and
the
surrounding
country
to
the
best
of
their
ability
they
were
as
faithful
to
the
commandments
of
the
church
as
any
weak
mortal
could
hope
to
be
they
were
sufficiently
loyal
to
their
king
or
emperor
to
keep
on
good
terms
with
those
distant
but
always
dangerous
potentates
in
short
they
tried
to
do
right
and
to
be
fair
to
their
neighbours
without
being
exactly
unfair
to
their
own
interests
it
was
not
an
ideal
world
in
which
they
found
themselves
the
greater
part
of
the
people
were
serfs
or
villains
who
were
as
much
a
part
of
the
soil
upon
which
they
lived
as
the
cows
and
sheep
whose
stables
they
shared
their
fate
was
not
particularly
happy
nor
was
it
particularly
unhappy
but
what
was
one
to
do
the
good
lord
who
ruled
the
world
of
the
middle
ages
had
undoubtedly
ordered
everything
for
the
best
if
he
in
his
wisdom
had
decided
that
there
must
be
both
knights
and
serfs
it
was
not
the
duty
of
these
faithful
sons
of
the
church
to
question
the
arrangement
the
serfs
therefore
did
not
complain
but
when
they
were
too
hard
driven
they
would
die
off
like
cattle
which
are
not
fed
and
stabled
in
the
right
way
and
then
something
would
be
hastily
done
to
better
their
condition
but
if
the
progress
of
the
world
had
been
left
to
the
serf
and
his
feudal
master
we
would
still
be
living
after
the
fashion
of
the
twelfth
century
saying
abracadabra
when
we
tried
to
stop
a
and
feeling
a
deep
contempt
and
hatred
for
the
dentist
who
offered
to
help
us
with
his
science
which
most
likely
was
of
mohammedan
or
heathenish
origin
and
therefore
both
wicked
and
useless
when
you
grow
up
you
will
discover
that
many
people
do
not
believe
in
progress
and
they
will
prove
to
you
by
the
terrible
deeds
of
some
of
our
own
contemporaries
that
the
world
does
not
change
but
i
hope
that
you
will
not
pay
much
attention
to
such
talk
you
see
it
took
our
ancestors
almost
a
million
years
to
learn
how
to
walk
on
their
hind
legs
other
centuries
had
to
go
by
before
their
grunts
developed
into
an
understandable
language
writing
the
art
of
preserving
our
ideas
for
the
benefit
of
future
generations
without
which
no
progress
is
possible
was
invented
only
four
thousand
years
ago
the
idea
of
turning
the
forces
of
nature
into
the
obedient
servants
of
man
was
quite
new
in
the
days
of
your
own
grandfather
it
seems
to
me
therefore
that
we
are
making
progress
at
an
rate
of
speed
perhaps
we
have
paid
a
little
too
much
attention
to
the
mere
physical
comforts
of
life
that
will
change
in
due
course
of
time
and
we
shall
then
attack
the
problems
which
are
not
related
to
health
and
to
wages
and
plumbing
and
machinery
in
general
but
please
do
not
be
too
sentimental
about
the
good
old
days
many
people
who
only
see
the
beautiful
churches
and
the
great
works
of
art
which
the
middle
ages
have
left
behind
grow
quite
eloquent
when
they
compare
our
own
ugly
civilisation
with
its
hurry
and
its
noise
and
the
evil
smells
of
backfiring
motor
trucks
with
the
cities
of
a
thousand
years
ago
but
these
mediaeval
churches
were
invariably
surrounded
by
miserable
hovels
compared
to
which
a
modern
tenement
house
stands
forth
as
a
luxurious
palace
it
is
true
that
the
noble
lancelot
and
the
equally
noble
parsifal
the
pure
young
hero
who
went
in
search
of
the
holy
grail
were
not
bothered
by
the
odor
of
gasoline
but
there
were
other
smells
of
the
barnyard
variety
odors
of
decaying
refuse
which
had
been
thrown
into
the
street
of
surrounding
the
palace
of
unwashed
people
who
had
inherited
their
coats
and
hats
from
their
grandfathers
and
who
had
never
learned
the
blessing
of
soap
i
do
not
want
to
paint
too
unpleasant
a
picture
but
when
you
read
in
the
ancient
chronicles
that
the
king
of
france
looking
out
of
the
windows
of
his
palace
fainted
at
the
stench
caused
by
the
pigs
rooting
in
the
streets
of
paris
when
an
ancient
manuscript
recounts
a
few
details
of
an
epidemic
of
the
plague
or
of
then
you
begin
to
that
progress
is
something
more
than
a
catchword
used
by
modern
advertising
men
no
the
progress
of
the
last
six
hundred
years
would
not
have
been
possible
without
the
existence
of
cities
i
shall
therefore
have
to
make
this
chapter
a
little
longer
than
many
of
the
others
it
is
too
important
to
be
reduced
to
three
or
four
pages
devoted
to
mere
political
events
the
ancient
world
of
egypt
and
babylonia
and
assyria
had
been
a
world
of
cities
greece
had
been
a
country
of
the
history
of
phoenicia
was
the
history
of
two
cities
called
sidon
and
tyre
the
roman
empire
was
the
hinterland
of
a
single
town
writing
art
science
astronomy
architecture
literature
the
theatre
the
list
is
endless
have
all
been
products
of
the
city
for
almost
four
thousand
years
the
wooden
which
we
call
a
town
had
been
the
workshop
of
the
world
then
came
the
great
migrations
the
roman
empire
was
destroyed
the
cities
were
burned
down
and
europe
once
more
became
a
land
of
pastures
and
little
agricultural
villages
during
the
dark
ages
the
fields
of
civilisation
had
lain
fallow
the
crusades
had
prepared
the
soil
for
a
new
crop
it
was
time
for
the
harvest
but
the
fruit
was
plucked
by
the
burghers
of
the
free
cities
i
have
told
you
the
story
of
the
castles
and
the
monasteries
with
their
heavy
stone
enclosures
the
homes
of
the
knights
and
the
monks
who
guarded
men
bodies
and
their
souls
you
have
seen
how
a
few
artisans
butchers
and
bakers
and
an
occasional
maker
came
to
live
near
the
castle
to
tend
to
the
wants
of
their
masters
and
to
find
protection
in
case
of
danger
sometimes
the
feudal
lord
allowed
these
people
to
surround
their
houses
with
a
stockade
but
they
were
dependent
for
their
living
upon
the
of
the
mighty
seigneur
of
the
castle
when
he
went
about
they
knelt
before
him
and
kissed
his
hand
then
came
the
crusades
and
many
things
changed
the
migrations
had
driven
people
from
the
to
the
west
the
crusades
made
millions
of
people
travel
from
the
west
to
the
highly
civilised
regions
of
the
they
discovered
that
the
world
was
not
bounded
by
the
four
walls
of
their
little
settlement
they
came
to
appreciate
better
clothes
more
comfortable
houses
new
dishes
products
of
the
mysterious
orient
after
their
return
to
their
old
homes
they
insisted
that
they
be
supplied
with
those
articles
the
peddler
with
his
pack
upon
his
back
the
only
merchant
of
the
dark
ages
added
these
goods
to
his
old
merchandise
bought
a
cart
hired
a
few
to
protect
him
against
the
crime
wave
which
followed
this
great
international
war
and
went
forth
to
do
business
upon
a
more
modern
and
larger
scale
his
career
was
not
an
easy
one
every
time
he
entered
the
domains
of
another
lord
he
had
to
pay
tolls
and
taxes
but
the
business
was
profitable
all
the
same
and
the
peddler
continued
to
make
his
rounds
soon
certain
energetic
merchants
discovered
that
the
goods
which
they
had
always
imported
from
afar
could
be
made
at
home
they
turned
part
of
their
homes
into
a
workgshop
sic
they
ceased
to
be
merchants
and
became
manufacturers
they
sold
their
products
not
only
to
the
lord
of
the
castle
and
to
the
abbot
in
his
monastery
but
they
exported
them
to
nearby
towns
the
lord
and
the
abbot
paid
them
with
products
of
their
farms
eggs
and
wines
and
with
honey
which
in
those
early
days
was
used
as
sugar
but
the
citizens
of
distant
towns
were
obliged
to
pay
in
cash
and
the
manufacturer
and
the
merchant
began
to
own
little
pieces
of
gold
which
entirely
changed
their
position
in
the
society
of
the
early
middle
ages
it
is
difficult
for
you
to
imagine
a
world
without
money
in
a
modern
city
one
can
not
possible
live
without
money
all
day
long
you
carry
a
pocket
full
of
small
discs
of
metal
to
pay
your
way
you
need
a
nickel
for
the
a
dollar
for
a
dinner
three
cents
for
an
evening
paper
but
many
people
of
the
early
middle
ages
never
saw
a
piece
of
coined
money
from
the
time
they
were
born
to
the
day
of
their
death
the
gold
and
silver
of
greece
and
rome
lay
buried
beneath
the
ruins
of
their
cities
the
world
of
the
migrations
which
had
succeeded
the
empire
was
an
agricultural
world
every
farmer
raised
enough
grain
and
enough
sheep
and
enough
cows
for
his
own
use
the
mediaeval
knight
was
a
country
squire
and
was
rarely
forced
to
pay
for
materials
in
money
his
estates
produced
everything
that
he
and
his
family
ate
and
drank
and
wore
on
their
backs
the
bricks
for
his
house
were
made
along
the
banks
of
the
nearest
river
wood
for
the
rafters
of
the
hall
was
cut
from
the
baronial
forest
the
few
articles
that
had
to
come
from
abroad
were
paid
for
in
goods
in
honey
in
eggs
in
fagots
but
the
crusades
upset
the
routine
of
the
old
agricultural
life
in
a
very
drastic
fashion
suppose
that
the
duke
of
hildesheim
was
going
to
the
holy
land
he
must
travel
thousands
of
miles
and
he
must
pay
his
passage
and
his
at
home
he
could
pay
with
products
of
his
farm
but
he
could
not
well
take
a
hundred
dozen
eggs
and
a
of
hams
with
him
to
satisfy
the
greed
of
the
shipping
agent
of
venice
or
the
of
the
brenner
pass
these
gentlemen
insisted
upon
cash
his
lordship
therefore
was
obliged
to
take
a
small
quantity
of
gold
with
him
upon
his
voyage
where
could
he
find
this
gold
he
could
borrow
it
from
the
lombards
the
descendants
of
the
old
longobards
who
had
turned
professional
who
seated
behind
their
commonly
known
as
banco
or
bank
were
glad
to
let
his
grace
have
a
few
hundred
gold
pieces
in
exchange
for
a
mortgage
upon
his
estates
that
they
might
be
repaid
in
case
his
lordship
should
die
at
the
hands
of
the
turks
that
was
dangerous
business
for
the
borrower
in
the
end
the
lombards
invariably
owned
the
estates
and
the
knight
became
a
bankrupt
who
hired
himself
out
as
a
fighting
man
to
a
more
powerful
and
more
careful
neighbour
his
grace
could
also
go
to
that
part
of
the
town
where
the
jews
were
forced
to
live
there
he
could
borrow
money
at
a
rate
of
fifty
or
sixty
percent
interest
that
too
was
bad
business
but
was
there
a
way
out
some
of
the
people
of
the
little
city
which
surrounded
the
castle
were
said
to
have
money
they
had
known
the
young
lord
all
his
life
his
father
and
their
fathers
had
been
good
friends
they
would
not
be
unreasonable
in
their
demands
very
well
his
lordship
clerk
a
monk
who
could
write
and
keep
accounts
sent
a
note
to
the
best
known
merchants
and
asked
for
a
small
loan
the
townspeople
met
in
the
of
the
jeweller
who
made
chalices
for
the
nearby
churches
and
discussed
this
demand
they
could
not
well
refuse
it
would
serve
no
purpose
to
ask
for
interest
in
the
first
place
it
was
against
the
religious
principles
of
most
people
to
take
interest
and
in
the
second
place
it
would
never
be
paid
except
in
agricultural
products
and
of
these
the
people
had
enough
and
to
spare
but
suggested
the
tailor
who
spent
his
days
quietly
sitting
upon
his
table
and
who
was
somewhat
of
a
philosopher
suppose
that
we
ask
some
favour
in
return
for
our
money
we
are
all
fond
of
fishing
but
his
lordship
wo
let
us
fish
in
his
brook
suppose
that
we
let
him
have
a
hundred
ducats
and
that
he
give
us
in
return
a
written
guarantee
allowing
us
to
fish
all
we
want
in
all
of
his
rivers
then
he
gets
the
hundred
which
he
needs
but
we
get
the
fish
and
it
will
be
good
business
all
around
the
day
his
lordship
accepted
this
proposition
it
seemed
such
an
easy
way
of
getting
a
hundred
gold
pieces
he
signed
the
of
his
own
power
his
clerk
drew
up
the
agreement
his
lordship
made
his
mark
for
he
could
not
sign
his
name
and
departed
for
the
east
two
years
later
he
came
back
dead
broke
the
townspeople
were
fishing
in
the
castle
pond
the
sight
of
this
silent
row
of
anglers
annoyed
his
lordship
he
told
his
equerry
to
go
and
chase
the
crowd
away
they
went
but
that
night
a
delegation
of
merchants
visited
the
castle
they
were
very
polite
they
congratulated
his
lordship
upon
his
safe
return
they
were
sorry
his
lordship
had
been
annoyed
by
the
fishermen
but
as
his
lordship
might
perhaps
remember
he
had
given
them
permission
to
do
so
himself
and
the
tailor
produced
the
charter
which
had
been
kept
in
the
safe
of
the
jeweller
ever
since
the
master
had
gone
to
the
holy
land
his
lordship
was
much
annoyed
but
once
more
he
was
in
dire
need
of
some
money
in
italy
he
had
signed
his
name
to
certain
documents
which
were
now
in
the
possession
of
salvestro
dei
medici
the
banker
these
documents
were
promissory
notes
and
they
were
due
two
months
from
date
their
total
amount
came
to
three
hundred
and
forty
pounds
flemish
gold
under
these
circumstances
the
noble
knight
could
not
well
show
the
rage
which
filled
his
heart
and
his
proud
soul
instead
he
suggested
another
little
loan
the
merchants
retired
to
discuss
the
matter
after
three
days
they
came
back
and
said
yes
they
were
only
too
happy
to
be
able
to
help
their
master
in
his
difficulties
but
in
return
for
the
golden
pounds
would
he
give
them
another
written
promise
another
charter
that
they
the
townspeople
might
establish
a
council
of
their
own
to
be
elected
by
all
the
merchants
and
free
citizens
of
the
city
said
council
to
manage
civic
affairs
without
interference
from
the
side
of
the
castle
his
lordship
was
confoundedly
angry
but
again
he
needed
the
money
he
said
yes
and
signed
the
charter
next
week
he
repented
he
called
his
soldiers
and
went
to
the
house
of
the
jeweller
and
asked
for
the
documents
which
his
crafty
subjects
had
cajoled
out
of
him
under
the
pressure
of
circumstances
he
took
them
away
and
burned
them
the
townspeople
stood
by
and
said
nothing
but
when
next
his
lordship
needed
money
to
pay
for
the
dowry
of
his
daughter
he
was
unable
to
get
a
single
penny
after
that
little
affair
at
the
jeweller
his
credit
was
not
considered
good
he
was
forced
to
eat
and
offer
to
make
certain
reparations
before
his
lordship
got
the
first
installment
of
the
stipulated
sum
the
townspeople
were
once
more
in
possession
of
all
their
old
charters
and
a
brand
new
one
which
permitted
them
to
build
a
and
a
strong
tower
where
all
the
charters
might
be
kept
protected
against
fire
and
theft
which
really
meant
protected
against
future
violence
on
the
part
of
the
lord
and
his
armed
followers
this
in
a
very
general
way
is
what
happened
during
the
centuries
which
followed
the
crusades
it
was
a
slow
process
this
gradual
shifting
of
power
from
the
castle
to
the
city
there
was
some
fighting
a
few
tailors
and
jewellers
were
killed
and
a
few
castles
went
up
in
smoke
but
such
occurrences
were
not
common
almost
imperceptibly
the
towns
grew
richer
and
the
feudal
lords
grew
poorer
to
maintain
themselves
they
were
for
ever
forced
to
exchange
charters
of
civic
liberty
in
return
for
ready
cash
the
cities
grew
they
offered
an
asylum
to
serfs
who
gained
their
liberty
after
they
had
lived
a
number
of
years
behind
the
city
walls
they
came
to
be
the
home
of
the
more
energetic
elements
of
the
surrounding
country
districts
they
were
proud
of
their
new
importance
and
expressed
their
power
in
the
churches
and
public
buildings
which
they
erected
around
the
old
market
place
where
centuries
before
the
barter
of
eggs
and
sheep
and
honey
and
salt
had
taken
place
they
wanted
their
children
to
have
a
better
chance
in
life
than
they
had
enjoyed
themselves
they
hired
monks
to
come
to
their
city
and
be
school
teachers
when
they
heard
of
a
man
who
could
paint
pictures
upon
boards
of
wood
they
offered
him
a
pension
if
he
would
come
and
cover
the
walls
of
their
chapels
and
their
town
hall
with
scenes
from
the
holy
scriptures
meanwhile
his
lordship
in
the
dreary
and
drafty
halls
of
his
castle
saw
all
this
splendour
and
regretted
the
day
when
first
he
had
signed
away
a
single
one
of
his
sovereign
rights
and
prerogatives
but
he
was
helpless
the
townspeople
with
their
snapped
their
fingers
at
him
they
were
free
men
fully
prepared
to
hold
what
they
had
gained
by
the
sweat
of
their
brow
and
after
a
struggle
which
had
lasted
for
more
than
ten
generations
mediaeval
how
the
people
of
the
cities
asserted
their
right
to
be
heard
in
the
royal
councils
of
their
country
as
long
as
people
were
nomads
wandering
tribes
of
shepherds
all
men
had
been
equal
and
had
been
responsible
for
the
welfare
and
safety
of
the
entire
community
but
after
they
had
settled
down
and
some
had
become
rich
and
others
had
grown
poor
the
government
was
apt
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
those
who
were
not
obliged
to
work
for
their
living
and
who
could
devote
themselves
to
politics
i
have
told
you
how
this
had
happened
in
egypt
and
in
mesopotamia
and
in
greece
and
in
rome
it
occurred
among
the
germanic
population
of
western
europe
as
soon
as
order
had
been
restored
the
western
european
world
was
ruled
in
the
first
place
by
an
emperor
who
was
elected
by
the
seven
or
eight
most
important
kings
of
the
vast
roman
empire
of
the
german
nation
and
who
enjoyed
a
great
deal
of
imaginary
and
very
little
actual
power
it
was
ruled
by
a
number
of
kings
who
sat
upon
shaky
thrones
the
government
was
in
the
hands
of
thousands
of
feudal
princelets
their
subjects
were
peasants
or
serfs
there
were
few
cities
there
was
hardly
any
middle
class
but
during
the
thirteenth
century
after
an
absence
of
almost
a
thousand
years
the
middle
class
the
merchant
class
once
more
appeared
upon
the
historical
stage
and
its
rise
in
power
as
we
saw
in
the
last
chapter
had
meant
a
decrease
in
the
influence
of
the
castle
folk
thus
far
the
king
in
ruling
his
domains
had
only
paid
attention
to
the
wishes
of
his
noblemen
and
his
bishops
but
the
new
world
of
trade
and
commerce
which
grew
out
of
the
crusades
forced
him
to
recognise
the
middle
class
or
suffer
from
an
emptiness
of
his
exchequer
their
majesties
if
they
had
followed
their
hidden
wishes
would
have
as
lief
consulted
their
cows
and
their
pigs
as
the
good
burghers
of
their
cities
but
they
could
not
help
themselves
they
swallowed
the
bitter
pill
because
it
was
gilded
but
not
without
a
struggle
in
england
during
the
absence
of
richard
the
lion
hearted
who
had
gone
to
the
holy
land
but
who
was
spending
the
greater
part
of
his
crusading
voyage
in
an
austrian
jail
the
government
of
the
country
had
been
placed
in
the
hands
of
john
a
brother
of
richard
who
was
his
inferior
in
the
art
of
war
but
his
equal
as
a
bad
administrator
john
had
begun
his
career
as
a
regent
by
losing
normandy
and
the
greater
part
of
the
french
possessions
next
he
had
managed
to
get
into
a
quarrel
with
pope
innocent
iii
the
famous
enemy
of
the
hohenstaufens
the
pope
had
excommunicated
john
as
gregory
vii
had
excommunicated
the
emperor
henry
iv
two
centuries
before
in
the
year
john
had
been
obliged
to
make
an
ignominious
peace
just
as
henry
iv
had
been
obliged
to
do
in
the
year
undismayed
by
his
lack
of
success
john
continued
to
abuse
his
royal
power
until
his
disgruntled
vassals
made
a
prisoner
of
their
anointed
ruler
and
forced
him
to
promise
that
he
would
be
good
and
would
never
again
interfere
with
the
ancient
rights
of
his
subjects
all
this
happened
on
a
little
island
in
the
thames
near
the
village
of
runnymede
on
the
of
june
of
the
year
the
document
to
which
john
signed
his
name
was
called
the
big
charter
the
magna
carta
it
contained
very
little
that
was
new
it
in
short
and
direct
sentences
the
ancient
duties
of
the
king
and
enumerated
the
privileges
of
his
vassals
it
paid
little
attention
to
the
rights
if
any
of
the
vast
majority
of
the
people
the
peasants
but
it
offered
certain
securities
to
the
rising
class
of
the
merchants
it
was
a
charter
of
great
importance
because
it
defined
the
powers
of
the
king
with
more
precision
than
had
ever
been
done
before
but
it
was
still
a
purely
mediaeval
document
it
did
not
refer
to
common
human
beings
unless
they
happened
to
be
the
property
of
the
vassal
which
must
be
against
royal
tyranny
just
as
the
baronial
woods
and
cows
were
protected
against
an
excess
of
zeal
on
the
part
of
the
royal
foresters
a
few
years
later
however
we
begin
to
hear
a
very
different
note
in
the
councils
of
his
majesty
john
who
was
bad
both
by
birth
and
inclination
solemnly
had
promised
to
obey
the
great
charter
and
then
had
broken
every
one
of
its
many
stipulations
fortunately
he
soon
died
and
was
succeeded
by
his
son
henry
iii
who
was
forced
to
recognise
the
charter
anew
meanwhile
uncle
richard
the
crusader
had
cost
the
country
a
great
deal
of
money
and
the
king
was
obliged
to
ask
for
a
few
loans
that
he
might
pay
his
obligations
to
the
jewish
the
large
and
the
bishops
who
acted
as
councillors
to
the
king
could
not
provide
him
with
the
necessary
gold
and
silver
the
king
then
gave
orders
that
a
few
representatives
of
the
cities
be
called
upon
to
attend
the
sessions
of
his
great
council
they
made
their
first
appearance
in
the
year
they
were
supposed
to
act
only
as
financial
experts
who
were
not
supposed
to
take
a
part
in
the
general
discussion
of
matters
of
state
but
to
give
advice
exclusively
upon
the
question
of
taxation
gradually
however
these
representatives
of
the
commons
were
consulted
upon
many
of
the
problems
and
the
meeting
of
noblemen
bishops
and
city
delegates
developed
into
a
regular
parliament
a
place
ou
parfait
which
means
in
english
where
people
talked
before
important
affairs
of
state
were
decided
upon
but
the
institution
of
such
a
general
with
certain
executive
powers
was
not
an
english
invention
as
seems
to
ke
the
general
belief
and
government
by
a
king
and
his
parliament
was
by
no
means
restricted
to
the
british
isles
you
will
find
it
in
every
part
of
europe
in
some
countries
like
france
the
rapid
increase
of
the
royal
power
after
the
middle
ages
reduced
the
influence
of
the
parliament
to
nothing
in
the
year
representatives
of
the
cities
had
been
admitted
to
the
meeting
of
the
french
parliament
but
five
centuries
had
to
pass
before
this
parliament
was
strong
enough
to
assert
the
rights
of
the
middle
class
the
third
estate
and
break
the
power
of
the
king
then
they
made
up
for
lost
time
and
during
the
french
revolution
abolished
the
king
the
clergy
and
the
nobles
and
made
the
representatives
of
the
common
people
the
rulers
of
the
land
in
spain
the
cortex
the
king
council
had
been
opened
to
the
commoners
as
early
as
the
first
half
of
the
twelfth
century
in
the
germain
empire
a
number
of
important
cities
had
obtained
the
rank
of
imperial
cities
whose
representatives
must
be
heard
in
the
imperial
diet
in
sweden
representatives
of
the
people
attended
the
sessions
of
the
riksdag
at
the
first
meeting
of
the
year
in
denmark
the
daneholf
the
ancient
national
assembly
was
in
and
although
the
nobles
often
regained
control
of
the
country
at
the
expense
of
the
king
and
the
people
the
representatives
of
the
cities
were
never
completely
deprived
of
their
power
in
the
scandinavian
country
the
story
of
representative
government
is
particularly
interesting
in
iceland
the
althing
the
assembly
of
all
free
landowners
who
managed
the
affairs
of
the
island
began
to
hold
regular
meetings
in
the
ninth
century
and
continued
to
do
so
for
more
than
a
thousand
years
in
switzerland
the
freemen
of
the
different
cantons
defended
their
assemblies
against
the
attempts
of
a
number
of
feudal
neighbours
with
great
success
finally
in
the
low
countries
in
holland
the
councils
of
the
different
duchies
and
counties
were
attended
by
representatives
of
the
third
estate
as
early
as
the
thirteenth
century
in
the
sixteenth
century
a
number
of
these
small
provinces
rebelled
against
their
king
abjured
his
majesty
in
a
solemn
meeting
of
the
estates
general
removed
the
clergy
from
the
discussions
broke
the
power
of
the
nobles
and
assumed
full
executive
authority
over
the
republic
of
the
united
seven
netherlands
for
two
centuries
the
representatives
of
the
ruled
the
country
without
a
king
without
bishops
and
without
noblemen
the
city
had
become
supreme
and
the
good
burghers
had
become
the
rulers
of
the
land
the
mediaeval
world
what
the
people
of
the
middle
ages
thought
of
the
world
in
which
they
happened
to
live
dates
are
a
very
useful
invention
we
could
not
do
without
them
but
unless
we
are
very
careful
they
will
play
tricks
with
us
they
are
apt
to
make
history
too
precise
for
example
when
i
talk
of
the
of
mediaeval
man
i
do
not
mean
that
on
the
of
december
of
the
year
suddenly
all
the
people
of
europe
said
ah
now
the
roman
empire
has
come
to
an
end
and
we
are
living
in
the
middle
ages
how
interesting
you
could
have
found
men
at
the
frankish
court
of
charlemagne
who
were
romans
in
their
habits
in
their
manners
in
their
upon
life
on
the
other
hand
when
you
grow
up
you
will
discover
that
some
of
the
people
in
this
world
have
never
passed
beyond
the
stage
of
the
all
times
and
all
ages
overlap
and
the
ideas
of
succeeding
generations
play
tag
with
each
other
but
it
is
possible
to
study
the
minds
of
a
good
many
true
representatives
of
the
middle
ages
and
then
give
you
an
idea
of
the
average
man
attitude
toward
life
and
the
many
difficult
problems
of
living
first
of
all
remember
that
the
people
of
the
middle
ages
never
thought
of
themselves
as
citizens
who
could
come
and
go
at
will
and
shape
their
fate
according
to
their
ability
or
energy
or
luck
on
the
contrary
they
all
considered
themselves
part
of
the
general
scheme
of
things
which
included
emperors
and
serfs
popes
and
heretics
heroes
and
swashbucklers
rich
men
poor
men
beggar
men
and
thieves
they
accepted
this
divine
ordinance
and
asked
no
questions
in
this
of
course
they
differed
radically
from
modern
people
who
accept
nothing
and
who
are
forever
trying
to
improve
their
own
financial
and
political
situation
to
the
man
and
woman
of
the
thirteenth
century
the
world
hereafter
a
heaven
of
wonderful
delights
and
a
hell
of
brimstone
and
suffering
meant
something
more
than
empty
words
or
vague
theological
phrases
it
was
an
actual
fact
and
the
mediaeval
burghers
and
knights
spent
the
greater
part
of
their
time
preparing
for
it
we
modern
people
regard
a
noble
death
after
a
life
with
the
quiet
calm
of
the
ancient
greeks
and
romans
after
three
score
years
of
work
and
effort
we
go
to
sleep
with
the
feeling
that
all
will
be
well
but
during
the
middle
ages
the
king
of
terrors
with
his
grinning
skull
and
his
rattling
bones
was
man
steady
companion
he
woke
his
victims
up
with
terrible
tunes
on
his
scratchy
fiddle
he
sat
down
with
them
at
dinner
he
smiled
at
them
from
behind
trees
and
shrubs
when
they
took
a
girl
out
for
a
walk
if
you
had
heard
nothing
but
yarns
about
cemeteries
and
coffins
and
fearful
diseases
when
you
were
very
young
instead
of
listening
to
the
fairy
stories
of
anderson
and
grimm
you
too
would
have
lived
all
your
days
in
a
dread
of
the
final
hour
and
the
gruesome
day
of
judgment
that
is
exactly
what
happened
to
the
children
of
the
middle
ages
they
moved
in
a
world
of
devils
and
spooks
and
only
a
few
occasional
angels
sometimes
their
fear
of
the
future
filled
their
souls
with
humility
and
piety
but
often
it
influenced
them
the
other
way
and
made
them
cruel
and
sentimental
they
would
first
of
all
murder
all
the
women
and
children
of
a
captured
city
and
then
they
would
devoutly
march
to
a
holy
spot
and
with
their
hands
gory
with
the
blood
of
innocent
victims
they
would
pray
that
a
merciful
heaven
forgive
them
their
sins
yea
they
would
do
more
than
pray
they
would
weep
bitter
tears
and
would
confess
themselves
the
most
wicked
of
sinners
but
the
next
day
they
would
once
more
butcher
a
camp
of
saracen
enemies
without
a
spark
of
mercy
in
their
hearts
of
course
the
crusaders
were
knights
and
obeyed
a
somewhat
different
code
of
manners
from
the
common
men
but
in
such
respects
the
common
man
was
just
the
same
as
his
master
he
too
resembled
a
shy
horse
easily
frightened
by
a
shadow
or
a
silly
piece
of
paper
capable
of
excellent
and
faithful
service
but
liable
to
run
away
and
do
terrible
damage
when
his
feverish
imagination
saw
a
ghost
in
judging
these
good
people
however
it
is
wise
to
remember
the
terrible
disadvantages
under
which
they
lived
they
were
really
barbarians
who
posed
as
civilised
people
charlemagne
and
otto
the
great
were
called
roman
emperors
but
they
had
as
little
resemblance
to
a
real
roman
emperor
say
augustus
or
marcus
aurelius
as
king
wumba
wumba
of
the
upper
congo
has
to
the
highly
educated
rulers
of
sweden
or
denmark
they
were
savages
who
lived
amidst
glorious
ruins
but
who
did
not
share
the
benefits
of
the
civilisation
which
their
fathers
and
grandfathers
had
destroyed
they
knew
nothing
they
were
ignorant
of
almost
every
fact
which
a
boy
of
twelve
knows
they
were
obliged
to
go
to
one
single
book
for
all
their
information
that
was
the
bible
but
those
parts
of
the
bible
which
have
influenced
the
history
of
the
human
race
for
the
better
are
those
chapters
of
the
new
testament
which
teach
us
the
great
moral
lessons
of
love
charity
and
forgiveness
as
a
handbook
of
astronomy
zoology
botany
geometry
and
all
the
other
sciences
the
venerable
book
is
not
entirely
reliable
in
the
twelfth
century
a
second
book
was
added
to
the
mediaeval
library
the
great
encyclopaedia
of
useful
knowledge
compiled
by
aristotle
the
greek
philosopher
of
the
fourth
century
before
christ
why
the
christian
church
should
have
been
willing
to
accord
such
high
honors
to
the
teacher
of
alexander
the
great
whereas
they
condemned
all
other
greek
philosophers
on
account
of
their
heathenish
doctrines
i
really
do
not
know
but
next
to
the
bible
aristotle
was
recognized
as
the
only
reliable
teacher
whose
works
could
be
safely
placed
into
the
hands
of
true
christians
his
works
had
reached
europe
in
a
somewhat
roundabout
way
they
had
gone
from
greece
to
alexandria
they
had
then
been
translated
from
the
greek
into
the
arabic
language
by
the
mohammedans
who
conquered
egypt
in
the
seventh
century
they
had
followed
the
moslem
armies
into
spain
and
the
philosophy
of
the
great
stagirite
aristotle
was
a
native
of
stagira
in
macedonia
was
taught
in
the
moorish
universities
of
cordova
the
arabic
text
was
then
translated
into
latin
by
the
christian
students
who
had
crossed
the
pyrenees
to
get
a
liberal
education
and
this
much
travelled
version
of
the
famous
books
was
at
last
taught
at
the
different
schools
of
northwestern
europe
it
was
not
very
clear
but
that
made
it
all
the
more
interesting
with
the
help
of
the
bible
and
aristotle
the
most
brilliant
men
of
the
middle
ages
now
set
to
work
to
explain
all
things
between
heaven
and
earth
in
their
relation
to
the
expressed
will
of
god
these
brilliant
men
the
scholasts
or
schoolmen
were
really
very
intelligent
but
they
had
obtained
their
information
exclusively
from
books
and
never
from
actual
observation
if
they
wanted
to
lecture
on
the
sturgeon
or
on
caterpillars
they
read
the
old
and
new
testaments
and
aristotle
and
told
their
students
everything
these
good
books
had
to
say
upon
the
subject
of
caterpillars
and
sturgeons
they
did
not
go
out
to
the
nearest
river
to
catch
a
sturgeon
they
did
not
leave
their
libraries
and
repair
to
the
backyard
to
catch
a
few
caterpillars
and
look
at
these
animals
and
study
them
in
their
native
haunts
even
such
famous
scholars
as
albertus
magnus
and
thomas
aquinas
did
not
inquire
whether
the
sturgeons
in
the
land
of
palestine
and
the
caterpillars
of
macedonia
might
not
have
been
different
from
the
sturgeons
and
the
caterpillars
of
western
europe
when
occasionally
an
exceptionally
curious
person
like
roger
bacon
appeared
in
the
council
of
the
learned
and
began
to
experiment
with
magnifying
glasses
and
funny
little
telescopes
and
actually
dragged
the
sturgen
and
the
caterpillar
into
the
lecturing
room
and
proved
that
they
were
different
from
the
creatures
described
by
the
old
testament
and
by
aristotle
the
schoolmen
shook
their
dignified
heads
bacon
was
going
too
far
when
he
dared
to
suggest
that
an
hour
of
actual
observation
was
worth
more
than
ten
years
with
aristotle
and
that
the
works
of
that
famous
greek
might
as
well
have
remained
untranslated
for
all
the
good
they
had
ever
done
the
scholasts
went
to
the
police
and
said
this
man
is
a
danger
to
the
safety
of
the
state
he
wants
us
to
study
greek
that
we
may
read
aristotle
in
the
original
why
should
he
not
be
contented
with
our
translation
which
has
satisfied
our
faithful
people
for
so
many
hundred
years
why
is
he
so
curious
about
the
insides
of
fishes
and
the
insides
of
insects
he
is
probably
a
wicked
magician
trying
to
upset
the
established
order
of
things
by
his
black
magic
and
so
well
did
they
plead
their
cause
that
the
frightened
guardians
of
the
peace
forbade
bacon
to
write
a
single
word
for
more
than
ten
years
when
he
resumed
his
studies
he
had
learned
a
lesson
he
wrote
his
books
in
a
queer
cipher
which
made
it
impossible
for
his
contemporaries
to
read
them
a
trick
which
became
common
as
the
church
became
more
desperate
in
its
attempts
to
prevent
people
from
asking
questions
which
would
lead
to
doubts
and
infidelity
this
however
was
not
done
out
of
any
wicked
desire
to
keep
people
ignorant
the
feeling
which
prompted
the
heretic
hunters
of
that
day
was
really
a
very
kindly
one
they
firmly
believed
nay
they
knew
that
this
life
was
but
the
preparation
for
our
real
existence
in
the
next
world
they
felt
convinced
that
too
much
knowledge
made
people
uncomfortable
filled
their
minds
with
dangerous
opinions
and
led
to
doubt
and
hence
to
perdition
a
mediaeval
schoolman
who
saw
one
of
his
pupils
stray
away
from
the
revealed
authority
of
the
bible
and
aristotle
that
he
might
study
things
for
himself
felt
as
uncomfortable
as
a
loving
mother
who
sees
her
young
child
approach
a
hot
stove
she
knows
that
he
will
burn
his
little
fingers
if
he
is
allowed
to
touch
it
and
she
tries
to
keep
him
back
if
necessary
she
will
use
force
but
she
really
loves
the
child
and
if
he
will
only
obey
her
she
will
be
as
good
to
him
as
she
possibly
can
be
in
the
same
way
the
mediaeval
guardians
of
people
souls
while
they
were
strict
in
all
matters
pertaining
to
the
faith
slaved
day
and
night
to
render
the
greatest
possible
service
to
the
members
of
their
flock
they
held
out
a
helping
hand
whenever
they
could
and
the
society
of
that
day
shows
the
influence
of
thousands
of
good
men
and
pious
women
who
tried
to
make
the
fate
of
the
average
mortal
as
bearable
as
possible
a
serf
was
a
serf
and
his
position
would
never
change
but
the
good
lord
of
the
middle
ages
who
allowed
the
serf
to
remain
a
slave
all
his
life
had
bestowed
an
immortal
soul
upon
this
humble
creature
and
therefore
he
must
be
protected
in
his
rights
that
he
might
live
and
die
as
a
good
christian
when
he
grew
too
old
or
too
weak
to
work
he
must
be
taken
care
of
by
the
feudal
master
for
whom
he
had
worked
the
serf
therefore
who
led
a
monotonous
and
dreary
life
was
never
haunted
by
fear
of
he
knew
that
he
was
safe
that
he
could
not
be
thrown
out
of
employment
that
he
would
always
have
a
roof
over
his
head
a
leaky
roof
perhaps
but
roof
all
the
same
and
that
he
would
always
have
something
to
eat
this
feeling
of
stability
and
of
safety
was
found
in
all
classes
of
society
in
the
towns
the
merchants
and
the
artisans
established
guilds
which
assured
every
member
of
a
steady
income
it
did
not
encourage
the
ambitious
to
do
better
than
their
neighbours
too
often
the
guilds
gave
protection
to
the
slacker
who
managed
to
get
by
but
they
established
a
general
feeling
of
content
and
assurance
among
the
labouring
classes
which
no
longer
exists
in
our
day
of
general
competition
the
middle
ages
were
familiar
with
the
dangers
of
what
we
modern
people
call
corners
when
a
single
rich
man
gets
hold
of
all
the
available
grain
or
soap
or
pickled
herring
and
then
forces
the
world
to
buy
from
him
at
his
own
price
the
authorities
therefore
discouraged
wholesale
trading
and
regulated
the
price
at
which
merchants
were
allowed
to
sell
their
goods
the
middle
ages
disliked
competition
why
compete
and
fill
the
world
with
hurry
and
rivalry
and
a
multitude
of
pushing
men
when
the
day
of
judgement
was
near
at
hand
when
riches
would
count
for
nothing
and
when
the
good
serf
would
enter
the
golden
gates
of
heaven
while
the
bad
knight
was
sent
to
do
penance
in
the
deepest
pit
of
inferno
in
short
the
people
of
the
middle
ages
were
asked
to
surrender
part
of
their
liberty
of
thought
and
action
that
they
might
enjoy
greater
safety
from
poverty
of
the
body
and
poverty
of
the
soul
and
with
a
very
few
exceptions
they
did
not
object
they
firmly
believed
that
they
were
mere
visitors
upon
this
planet
that
they
were
here
to
be
prepared
for
a
greater
and
more
important
life
deliberately
they
turned
their
backs
upon
a
world
which
was
filled
with
suffering
and
wickedness
and
injustice
they
pulled
down
the
blinds
that
the
rays
of
the
sun
might
not
distract
their
attention
from
that
chapter
in
the
apocalypse
which
told
them
of
that
heavenly
light
which
was
to
illumine
their
happiness
in
all
eternity
they
tried
to
close
their
eyes
to
most
of
the
joys
of
the
world
in
which
they
lived
that
they
might
enjoy
those
which
awaited
them
in
the
near
future
they
accepted
life
as
a
necessary
evil
and
welcomed
death
as
the
beginning
of
a
glorious
day
the
greeks
and
the
romans
had
never
bothered
about
the
future
but
had
tried
to
establish
their
paradise
right
here
upon
this
earth
they
had
succeeded
in
making
life
extremely
pleasant
for
those
of
their
fellow
men
who
did
not
happen
to
be
slaves
then
came
the
other
extreme
of
the
middle
ages
when
man
built
himself
a
paradise
beyond
the
highest
clouds
and
turned
this
world
into
a
vale
of
tears
for
high
and
low
for
rich
and
poor
for
the
intelligent
and
the
dumb
it
was
time
for
the
pendulum
to
swing
back
in
the
other
direction
as
i
shall
tell
you
in
my
next
chapter
mediaeval
trade
how
the
crusades
once
more
made
the
mediterranean
a
busy
centre
of
trade
and
how
the
cities
of
the
italian
peninsula
became
the
great
distributing
centre
for
the
commerce
with
asia
and
africa
there
were
three
good
reasons
why
the
italian
cities
should
have
been
the
first
to
regain
a
position
of
great
importance
during
the
late
middle
ages
the
italian
peninsula
had
been
settled
by
rome
at
a
very
early
date
there
had
been
more
roads
and
more
towns
and
more
schools
than
anywhere
else
in
europe
the
barbarians
had
burned
as
lustily
in
italy
as
elsewhere
but
there
had
been
so
much
to
destroy
that
more
had
been
able
to
survive
in
the
second
place
the
pope
lived
in
italy
and
as
the
head
of
a
vast
political
machine
which
owned
land
and
serfs
and
buildings
and
forests
and
rivers
and
conducted
courts
of
law
he
was
in
constant
receipt
of
a
great
deal
of
money
the
papal
authorities
had
to
be
paid
in
gold
and
silver
as
did
the
merchants
and
of
venice
and
genoa
the
cows
and
the
eggs
and
the
horses
and
all
the
other
agricultural
products
of
the
north
and
the
west
must
be
changed
into
actual
cash
before
the
debt
could
be
paid
in
the
distant
city
of
rome
this
made
italy
the
one
country
where
there
was
a
comparative
abundance
of
gold
and
silver
finally
during
the
crusades
the
italian
cities
had
become
the
point
of
embarkation
for
the
crusaders
and
had
profiteered
to
an
almost
unbelievable
extent
and
after
the
crusades
had
come
to
an
end
these
same
italian
cities
remained
the
distributing
centres
for
those
oriental
goods
upon
which
the
people
of
europe
had
come
to
depend
during
the
time
they
had
spent
in
the
near
east
of
these
towns
few
were
as
famous
as
venice
venice
was
a
republic
built
upon
a
mud
bank
thither
people
from
the
mainland
had
fled
during
the
invasions
of
the
barbarians
in
the
fourth
century
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
the
sea
they
had
engaged
in
the
business
of
salt
had
been
very
scarce
during
the
middle
ages
and
the
price
had
been
high
for
hundreds
of
years
venice
had
enjoyed
a
monopoly
of
this
indispensable
table
commodity
i
say
indispensable
because
people
like
sheep
fall
ill
unless
they
get
a
certain
amount
of
salt
in
their
food
the
people
had
used
this
monopoly
to
increase
the
power
of
their
city
at
times
they
had
even
dared
to
defy
the
power
of
the
popes
the
town
had
grown
rich
and
had
begun
to
build
ships
which
engaged
in
trade
with
the
orient
during
the
crusades
these
ships
were
used
to
carry
passengers
to
the
holy
land
and
when
the
passengers
could
not
pay
for
their
tickets
in
cash
they
were
obliged
to
help
the
venetians
who
were
for
ever
increasing
their
colonies
in
the
aegean
sea
in
asia
minor
and
in
egypt
by
the
end
of
the
fourteenth
century
the
population
had
grown
to
two
hundred
thousand
which
made
venice
the
biggest
city
of
the
middle
ages
the
people
were
without
influence
upon
the
government
which
was
the
private
affair
of
a
small
number
of
rich
merchant
families
they
elected
a
senate
and
a
doge
or
duke
but
the
actual
rulers
of
the
city
were
the
members
of
the
famous
council
of
ten
who
maintained
themselves
with
the
help
of
a
highly
organised
system
of
secret
service
men
and
professional
murderers
who
kept
watch
upon
all
citizens
and
quietly
removed
those
who
might
be
dangerous
to
the
safety
of
their
and
unscrupulous
committee
of
public
safety
the
other
extreme
of
government
a
democracy
of
very
turbulent
habits
was
to
be
found
in
florence
this
city
controlled
the
main
road
from
northern
europe
to
rome
and
used
the
money
which
it
had
derived
from
this
fortunate
economic
position
to
engage
in
manufacturing
the
florentines
tried
to
follow
the
example
of
athens
noblemen
priests
and
members
of
the
guilds
all
took
part
in
the
discussions
of
civic
affairs
this
led
to
great
civic
upheaval
people
were
forever
being
divided
into
political
parties
and
these
parties
fought
each
other
with
intense
bitterness
and
exiled
their
enemies
and
confiscated
their
possessions
as
soon
as
they
had
gained
a
victory
in
the
council
after
several
centuries
of
this
rule
by
organised
mobs
the
inevitable
happened
a
powerful
family
made
itself
master
of
the
city
and
governed
the
town
and
the
surrounding
country
after
the
fashion
of
the
old
greek
tyrants
they
were
called
the
medici
the
earliest
medici
had
been
physicians
medicus
is
latin
for
physician
hence
their
name
but
later
they
had
turned
banker
their
banks
and
their
pawnshops
were
to
be
found
in
all
the
more
important
centres
of
trade
even
today
our
american
display
the
three
golden
balls
which
were
part
of
the
coat
of
arms
of
the
mighty
house
of
the
medici
who
became
rulers
of
florence
and
married
their
daughters
to
the
kings
of
france
and
were
buried
in
graves
worthy
of
a
roman
caesar
then
there
was
genoa
the
great
rival
of
venice
where
the
merchants
specialised
in
trade
with
tunis
in
africa
and
the
grain
depots
of
the
black
sea
then
there
were
more
than
two
hundred
other
cities
some
large
and
some
small
each
a
perfect
commercial
unit
all
of
them
fighting
their
neighbours
and
rivals
with
the
undying
hatred
of
neighbours
who
are
depriving
each
other
of
their
profits
once
the
products
of
the
orient
and
africa
had
been
brought
to
these
distributing
centres
they
must
be
prepared
for
the
voyage
to
the
west
and
the
north
genoa
carried
her
goods
by
water
to
marseilles
from
where
they
were
reshipped
to
the
cities
along
the
rhone
which
in
turn
served
as
the
market
places
of
northern
and
western
france
venice
used
the
land
route
to
northern
europe
this
ancient
road
led
across
the
brenner
pass
the
old
gateway
for
the
barbarians
who
had
invaded
italy
past
innsbruck
the
merchandise
was
carried
to
basel
from
there
it
drifted
down
the
rhine
to
the
north
sea
and
england
or
it
was
taken
to
augsburg
where
the
fugger
family
who
were
both
bankers
and
manufacturers
and
who
prospered
greatly
by
shaving
the
coins
with
which
they
paid
their
workmen
looked
after
the
further
distribution
to
nuremberg
and
leipzig
and
the
cities
of
the
baltic
and
to
wisby
on
the
island
of
gotland
which
looked
after
the
needs
of
the
northern
baltic
and
dealt
directly
with
the
republic
of
novgorod
the
old
commercial
centre
of
russia
which
was
destroyed
by
ivan
the
terrible
in
the
middle
of
the
sixteenth
century
the
little
cities
on
the
coast
of
europe
had
an
interesting
story
of
their
own
the
mediaeval
world
ate
a
great
deal
of
fish
there
were
many
fast
days
and
then
people
were
not
permitted
to
eat
meat
for
those
who
lived
away
from
the
coast
and
from
the
rivers
this
meant
a
diet
of
eggs
or
nothing
at
all
but
early
in
the
thirteenth
century
a
dutch
fisherman
had
discovered
a
way
of
curing
herring
so
that
it
could
be
transported
to
distant
points
the
herring
fisheries
of
the
north
sea
then
became
of
great
importance
but
some
time
during
the
thirteenth
century
this
useful
little
fish
for
reasons
of
its
own
moved
from
the
north
sea
to
the
baltic
and
the
cities
of
that
inland
sea
began
to
make
money
all
the
world
now
sailed
to
the
baltic
to
catch
herring
and
as
that
fish
could
only
be
caught
during
a
few
months
each
year
the
rest
of
the
time
it
spends
in
deep
water
raising
large
families
of
little
herrings
the
ships
would
have
been
idle
during
the
rest
of
the
time
unless
they
had
found
another
occupation
they
were
then
used
to
carry
the
wheat
of
northern
and
central
russia
to
southern
and
western
europe
on
the
return
voyage
they
brought
spices
and
silks
and
carpets
and
oriental
rugs
from
venice
and
genoa
to
bruges
and
hamburg
and
bremen
out
of
such
simple
beginnings
there
developed
an
important
system
of
international
trade
which
reached
from
the
manufacturing
cities
of
bruges
and
ghent
where
the
almighty
guilds
fought
pitched
battles
with
the
kings
of
france
and
england
and
established
a
labour
tyranny
which
completely
ruined
both
the
employers
and
the
workmen
to
the
republic
of
novgorod
in
northern
russia
which
was
a
mighty
city
until
tsar
ivan
who
distrusted
all
merchants
took
the
town
and
killed
sixty
thousand
people
in
less
than
a
month
time
and
reduced
the
survivors
to
beggary
that
they
might
protect
themselves
against
pirates
and
excessive
tolls
and
annoying
legislation
the
merchants
of
the
north
founded
a
protective
league
which
was
called
the
hansa
the
hansa
which
had
its
headquarters
in
lubeck
was
a
voluntary
association
of
more
than
one
hundred
cities
the
association
maintained
a
navy
of
its
own
which
patrolled
the
seas
and
fought
and
defeated
the
kings
of
england
and
denmark
when
they
dared
to
interfere
with
the
rights
and
the
privileges
of
the
mighty
hanseatic
merchants
i
wish
that
i
had
more
space
to
tell
you
some
of
the
wonderful
stories
of
this
strange
commerce
which
was
carried
on
across
the
high
mountains
and
across
the
deep
seas
amidst
such
dangers
that
every
voyage
became
a
glorious
adventure
but
it
would
take
several
volumes
and
it
can
not
be
done
here
besides
i
hope
that
i
have
told
you
enough
about
the
middle
ages
to
make
you
curious
to
read
more
in
the
excellent
books
of
which
i
shall
give
you
a
list
at
the
end
of
this
volume
the
middle
ages
as
i
have
tried
to
show
you
had
been
a
period
of
very
slow
progress
the
people
who
were
in
power
believed
that
progress
was
a
very
undesirable
invention
of
the
evil
one
and
ought
to
be
discouraged
and
as
they
to
occupy
the
seats
of
the
mighty
it
was
easy
to
enforce
their
will
upon
the
patient
serfs
and
the
illiterate
knights
here
and
there
a
few
brave
souls
sometimes
ventured
forth
into
the
forbidden
region
of
science
but
they
fared
badly
and
were
considered
lucky
when
they
escaped
with
their
lives
and
a
jail
sentence
of
twenty
years
in
the
twelfth
and
thirteenth
centuries
the
flood
of
international
commerce
swept
over
western
europe
as
the
nile
had
swept
across
the
valley
of
ancient
egypt
it
left
behind
a
fertile
sediment
of
prosperity
prosperity
meant
leisure
hours
and
these
leisure
hours
gave
both
men
and
women
a
chance
to
buy
manuscripts
and
take
an
interest
in
literature
and
art
and
music
then
once
more
was
the
world
filled
with
that
divine
curiosity
which
has
elevated
man
from
the
ranks
of
those
other
mammals
who
are
his
distant
cousins
but
who
have
remained
dumb
and
the
cities
of
whose
growth
and
development
i
have
told
you
in
my
last
chapter
offered
a
safe
shelter
to
these
brave
pioneers
who
dared
to
leave
the
very
narrow
domain
of
the
established
order
of
things
they
set
to
work
they
opened
the
windows
of
their
cloistered
and
studious
cells
a
flood
of
sunlight
entered
the
dusty
rooms
and
showed
them
the
cobwebs
which
had
gathered
during
the
long
period
of
they
began
to
clean
house
next
they
cleaned
their
gardens
then
they
went
out
into
the
open
fields
outside
the
crumbling
town
walls
and
said
this
is
a
good
world
we
are
glad
that
we
live
in
it
at
that
moment
the
middle
ages
came
to
an
end
and
a
new
world
began
the
renaissance
people
once
more
dared
to
be
happy
just
because
they
were
alive
they
tried
to
save
the
remains
of
the
older
and
more
agreeable
civilisation
of
rome
and
greece
and
they
were
so
proud
of
their
achievements
that
they
spoke
of
a
renaissance
or
of
civilisation
the
renaissance
was
not
a
political
or
religious
movement
it
was
a
state
of
mind
the
men
of
the
renaissance
continued
to
be
the
obedient
sons
of
the
mother
church
they
were
subjects
of
kings
and
emperors
and
dukes
and
murmured
not
but
their
outlook
upon
life
was
changed
they
began
to
wear
different
clothes
to
speak
a
different
language
to
live
different
lives
in
different
houses
they
no
longer
concentrated
all
their
thoughts
and
their
efforts
upon
the
blessed
existence
that
awaited
them
in
heaven
they
tried
to
establish
their
paradise
upon
this
planet
and
truth
to
tell
they
succeeded
in
a
remarkable
degree
i
have
quite
often
warned
you
against
the
danger
that
lies
in
historical
dates
people
take
them
too
literally
they
think
of
the
middle
ages
as
a
period
of
darkness
and
ignorance
click
says
the
clock
and
the
renaissance
begins
and
cities
and
palaces
are
flooded
with
the
bright
sunlight
of
an
eager
intellectual
curiosity
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
quite
impossible
to
draw
such
sharp
lines
the
thirteenth
century
belonged
most
decidedly
to
the
middle
ages
all
historians
agree
upon
that
but
was
it
a
time
of
darkness
and
stagnation
merely
by
no
means
people
were
tremendously
alive
great
states
were
being
founded
large
centres
of
commerce
were
being
developed
high
above
the
turretted
towers
of
the
castle
and
the
peaked
roof
of
the
rose
the
slender
spire
of
the
newly
built
gothic
cathedral
everywhere
the
world
was
in
motion
the
high
and
mighty
gentlemen
of
the
who
had
just
become
conscious
of
their
own
strength
by
way
of
their
recently
acquired
riches
were
struggling
for
more
power
with
their
feudal
masters
the
members
of
the
guilds
who
had
just
become
aware
of
the
important
fact
that
numbers
count
were
fighting
the
high
and
mighty
gentlemen
of
the
the
king
and
his
shrewd
advisers
went
fishing
in
these
troubled
waters
and
caught
many
a
shining
bass
of
profit
which
they
proceeded
to
cook
and
eat
before
the
noses
of
the
surprised
and
disappointed
councillors
and
guild
brethren
to
enliven
the
scenery
during
the
long
hours
of
evening
when
the
badly
lighted
streets
did
not
invite
further
political
and
economic
dispute
the
troubadours
and
minnesingers
told
their
stories
and
sang
their
songs
of
romance
and
adventure
and
heroism
and
loyalty
to
all
fair
women
meanwhile
youth
impatient
of
the
slowness
of
progress
flocked
to
the
universities
and
thereby
hangs
a
story
the
middle
ages
were
internationally
minded
that
sounds
difficult
but
wait
until
i
explain
it
to
you
we
modern
people
are
nationally
minded
we
are
americans
or
englishmen
or
frenchmen
or
italians
and
speak
english
or
french
or
italian
and
go
to
english
and
french
and
italian
universities
unless
we
want
to
specialise
in
some
particular
branch
of
learning
which
is
only
taught
elsewhere
and
then
we
learn
another
language
and
go
to
munich
or
madrid
or
moscow
but
the
people
of
the
thirteenth
or
fourteenth
century
rarely
talked
of
themselves
as
englishmen
or
frenchmen
or
italians
they
said
i
am
a
citizen
of
sheffield
or
bordeaux
or
genoa
because
they
all
belonged
to
one
and
the
same
church
they
felt
a
certain
bond
of
brotherhood
and
as
all
educated
men
could
speak
latin
they
possessed
an
international
language
which
removed
the
stupid
language
barriers
which
have
grown
up
in
modern
europe
and
which
place
the
small
nations
at
such
an
enormous
disadvantage
just
as
an
example
take
the
case
of
erasmus
the
great
preacher
of
tolerance
and
laughter
who
wrote
his
books
in
the
sixteenth
century
he
was
the
native
of
a
small
dutch
village
he
wrote
in
latin
and
all
the
world
was
his
audience
if
he
were
alive
he
would
write
in
dutch
then
only
five
or
six
million
people
would
be
able
to
read
him
to
be
understood
by
the
rest
of
europe
and
america
his
publishers
would
be
obliged
to
translate
his
books
into
twenty
different
languages
that
would
cost
a
lot
of
money
and
most
likely
the
publishers
would
never
take
the
trouble
or
the
risk
six
hundred
years
ago
that
could
not
happen
the
greater
part
of
the
people
were
still
very
ignorant
and
could
not
read
or
write
at
all
but
those
who
had
mastered
the
difficult
art
of
handling
the
belonged
to
an
international
republic
of
letters
which
spread
across
the
entire
continent
and
which
knew
of
no
boundaries
and
respected
no
limitations
of
language
or
nationality
the
universities
were
the
strongholds
of
this
republic
unlike
modern
fortifications
they
did
not
follow
the
frontier
they
were
to
be
found
wherever
a
teacher
and
a
few
pupils
happened
to
find
themselves
together
there
again
the
middle
ages
and
the
renaissance
differed
from
our
own
time
nowadays
when
a
new
university
is
built
the
process
almost
invariably
is
as
follows
some
rich
man
wants
to
do
something
for
the
community
in
which
he
lives
or
a
particular
religious
sect
wants
to
build
a
school
to
keep
its
faithful
children
under
decent
supervision
or
a
state
needs
and
lawyers
and
teachers
the
university
begins
as
a
large
sum
of
money
which
is
deposited
in
a
bank
this
money
is
then
used
to
construct
buildings
and
laboratories
and
dormitories
finally
professional
teachers
are
hired
entrance
examinations
are
held
and
the
university
is
on
the
way
but
in
the
middle
ages
things
were
done
differently
a
wise
man
said
to
himself
i
have
discovered
a
great
truth
i
must
impart
my
knowledge
to
others
and
he
began
to
preach
his
wisdom
wherever
and
whenever
he
could
get
a
few
people
to
listen
to
him
like
a
modern
orator
if
he
was
an
interesting
speaker
the
crowd
came
and
stayed
if
he
was
dull
they
shrugged
their
shoulders
and
continued
their
way
by
and
by
certain
young
men
began
to
come
regularly
to
hear
the
words
of
wisdom
of
this
great
teacher
they
brought
copybooks
with
them
and
a
little
bottle
of
ink
and
a
goose
quill
and
wrote
down
what
seemed
to
be
important
one
day
it
rained
the
teacher
and
his
pupils
retired
to
an
empty
basement
or
the
room
of
the
professor
the
learned
man
sat
in
his
chair
and
the
boys
sat
on
the
floor
that
was
the
beginning
of
the
university
the
universitas
a
corporation
of
professors
and
students
during
the
middle
ages
when
the
teacher
counted
for
everything
and
the
building
in
which
he
taught
counted
for
very
little
as
an
example
let
me
tell
you
of
something
that
happened
in
the
ninth
century
in
the
town
of
salerno
near
naples
there
were
a
number
of
excellent
physicians
they
attracted
people
desirous
of
learning
the
medical
profession
and
for
almost
a
thousand
years
until
there
was
a
university
of
salerno
which
taught
the
wisdom
of
hippocrates
the
great
greek
doctor
who
had
practiced
his
art
in
ancient
hellas
in
the
fifth
century
before
the
birth
of
christ
then
there
was
abelard
the
young
priest
from
brittany
who
early
in
the
twelfth
century
began
to
lecture
on
theology
and
logic
in
paris
thousands
of
eager
young
men
flocked
to
the
french
city
to
hear
him
other
priests
who
disagreed
with
him
stepped
forward
to
explain
their
point
of
view
paris
was
soon
filled
with
a
clamouring
multitude
of
englishmen
and
germans
and
italians
and
students
from
sweden
and
hungary
and
around
the
old
cathedral
which
stood
on
a
little
island
in
the
seine
there
grew
the
famous
university
of
paris
in
bologna
in
italy
a
monk
by
the
name
of
gratian
had
compiled
a
for
those
whose
business
it
was
to
know
the
laws
of
the
church
young
priests
and
many
laymen
then
came
from
all
over
europe
to
hear
gratian
explain
his
ideas
to
protect
themselves
against
the
landlords
and
the
innkeepers
and
the
ladies
of
the
city
they
formed
a
corporation
or
university
and
behold
the
beginning
of
the
university
of
bologna
next
there
was
a
quarrel
in
the
university
of
paris
we
do
not
know
what
caused
it
but
a
number
of
disgruntled
teachers
together
with
their
pupils
crossed
the
channel
and
found
a
hospitable
home
in
a
little
village
on
the
thames
called
oxford
and
in
this
way
the
famous
university
of
oxford
came
into
being
in
the
same
way
in
the
year
there
had
been
a
split
in
the
university
of
bologna
the
discontented
teachers
again
followed
by
their
pupils
had
moved
to
padua
and
their
proud
city
thenceforward
boasted
of
a
university
of
its
own
and
so
it
went
from
valladolid
in
spain
to
cracow
in
distant
poland
and
from
poitiers
in
france
to
rostock
in
germany
it
is
quite
true
that
much
of
the
teaching
done
by
these
early
professors
would
sound
absurd
to
our
ears
trained
to
listen
to
logarithms
and
geometrical
theorems
the
point
however
which
i
want
to
make
is
this
the
middle
ages
and
especially
the
thirteenth
century
were
not
a
time
when
the
world
stood
entirely
still
among
the
younger
generation
there
was
life
there
was
enthusiasm
and
there
was
a
restless
if
somewhat
bashful
asking
of
questions
and
out
of
this
turmoil
grew
the
renaissance
but
just
before
the
curtain
went
down
upon
the
last
scene
of
the
mediaeval
world
a
solitary
figure
crossed
the
stage
of
whom
you
ought
to
know
more
than
his
mere
name
this
man
was
called
dante
he
was
the
son
of
a
florentine
lawyer
who
belonged
to
the
alighieri
family
and
he
saw
the
light
of
day
in
the
year
he
grew
up
in
the
city
of
his
ancestors
while
giotto
was
painting
his
stories
of
the
life
of
francis
of
assisi
upon
the
walls
of
the
church
of
the
holy
cross
but
often
when
he
went
to
school
his
frightened
eyes
would
see
the
puddles
of
blood
which
told
of
the
terrible
and
endless
warfare
that
raged
forever
between
the
guelphs
and
the
ghibellines
the
followers
of
the
pope
and
the
adherents
of
the
emperors
when
he
grew
up
he
became
a
guelph
because
his
father
had
been
one
before
him
just
as
an
american
boy
might
become
a
democrat
or
a
republican
simply
because
his
father
had
happened
to
be
a
democrat
or
a
republican
but
after
a
few
years
dante
saw
that
italy
unless
united
under
a
single
head
threatened
to
perish
as
a
victim
of
the
disordered
jealousies
of
a
thousand
little
cities
then
he
became
a
ghilbeiline
he
looked
for
help
beyond
the
alps
he
hoped
that
a
mighty
emperor
might
come
and
unity
and
order
alas
he
hoped
in
vain
the
ghibellines
were
driven
out
of
florence
in
the
year
from
that
time
on
until
the
day
of
his
death
amidst
the
dreary
ruins
of
ravenna
in
the
year
dante
was
a
homeless
wanderer
eating
the
bread
of
charity
at
the
table
of
rich
patrons
whose
names
would
have
sunk
into
the
deepest
pit
of
oblivion
but
for
this
single
fact
that
they
had
been
kind
to
a
poet
in
his
misery
during
the
many
years
of
exile
dante
felt
compelled
to
justify
himself
and
his
actions
when
he
had
been
a
political
leader
in
his
and
when
he
had
spent
his
days
walking
along
the
banks
of
the
arno
that
he
might
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
lovely
beatrice
portinari
who
died
the
wife
of
another
man
a
dozen
years
before
the
ghibelline
disaster
he
had
failed
in
the
ambitions
of
his
career
he
had
faithfully
served
the
town
of
is
birth
and
before
a
corrupt
court
he
had
been
accused
of
stealing
the
public
funds
and
had
been
condemned
to
be
burned
alive
should
he
venture
back
within
the
realm
of
the
city
of
florence
to
clear
himself
before
his
own
conscience
and
before
his
contemporaries
dante
then
created
an
imaginary
world
and
with
great
detail
he
described
the
circumstances
which
had
led
to
his
defeat
and
depicted
the
hopeless
condition
of
greed
and
lust
and
hatred
which
had
turned
his
fair
and
beloved
italy
into
a
battlefield
for
the
pitiless
mercenaries
of
wicked
and
selfish
tyrants
he
tells
us
how
on
the
thursday
before
easter
of
the
year
he
had
lost
his
way
in
a
dense
forest
and
how
he
found
his
path
barred
by
a
leopard
and
a
lion
and
a
wolf
he
gave
himself
up
for
lost
when
a
white
figure
appeared
amidst
the
trees
it
was
virgil
the
roman
poet
and
philosopher
sent
upon
his
errand
of
mercy
by
the
blessed
virgin
and
by
beatrice
who
from
high
heaven
watched
over
the
fate
of
her
true
lover
virgil
then
takes
dante
through
purgatory
and
through
hell
deeper
and
deeper
the
path
leads
them
until
they
reach
the
lowest
pit
where
lucifer
himself
stands
frozen
into
the
eternal
ice
surrounded
by
the
most
terrible
of
sinners
traitors
and
liars
and
those
who
have
achieved
fame
and
success
by
lies
and
by
deceit
but
before
the
two
wanderers
have
reached
this
terrible
spot
dante
has
met
all
those
who
in
some
way
or
other
have
played
a
role
in
the
history
of
his
beloved
city
emperors
and
popes
dashing
knights
and
whining
usurers
they
are
all
there
doomed
to
eternal
punishment
or
awaiting
the
day
of
deliverance
when
they
shall
leave
purgatory
for
heaven
it
is
a
curious
story
it
is
a
handbook
of
everything
the
people
of
the
thirteenth
century
did
and
felt
and
feared
and
prayed
for
through
it
all
moves
the
figure
of
the
lonely
florentine
exile
forever
followed
by
the
shadow
of
his
own
despair
and
behold
when
the
gates
of
death
were
closing
upon
the
sad
poet
of
the
middle
ages
the
portals
of
life
swung
open
to
the
child
who
was
to
be
the
first
of
the
men
of
the
renaissance
that
was
francesco
petrarca
the
son
of
the
notary
public
of
the
little
town
of
arezzo
francesco
father
had
belonged
to
the
same
political
party
as
dante
he
too
had
been
exiled
and
thus
it
happened
that
petrarca
or
petrarch
as
we
call
him
was
born
away
from
florence
at
the
age
of
fifteen
he
was
sent
to
montpellier
in
france
that
he
might
become
a
lawyer
like
his
father
but
the
boy
did
not
want
to
be
a
jurist
he
hated
the
law
he
wanted
to
be
a
scholar
and
a
poet
and
because
he
wanted
to
be
a
scholar
and
a
poet
beyond
everything
else
he
became
one
as
people
of
a
strong
will
are
apt
to
do
he
made
long
voyages
copying
manuscripts
in
flanders
and
in
the
cloisters
along
the
rhine
and
in
paris
and
liege
and
finally
in
rome
then
he
went
to
live
in
a
lonely
valley
of
the
wild
mountains
of
vaucluse
and
there
he
studied
and
wrote
and
soon
he
had
become
so
famous
for
his
verse
and
for
his
learning
that
both
the
university
of
paris
and
the
king
of
naples
invited
him
to
come
and
teach
their
students
and
subjects
on
the
way
to
his
new
job
he
was
obliged
to
pass
through
rome
the
people
had
heard
of
his
fame
as
an
editor
of
roman
authors
they
decided
to
honour
him
and
in
the
ancient
forum
of
the
imperial
city
petrarch
was
crowned
with
the
laurel
wreath
of
the
poet
from
that
moment
on
his
life
was
an
endless
career
of
honour
and
appreciation
he
wrote
the
things
which
people
wanted
most
to
hear
they
were
tired
of
theological
disputations
poor
dante
could
wander
through
hell
as
much
as
he
wanted
but
petrarch
wrote
of
love
and
of
nature
and
the
sun
and
never
mentioned
those
gloomy
things
which
seemed
to
have
been
the
stock
in
trade
of
the
last
generation
and
when
petrarch
came
to
a
city
all
the
people
flocked
out
to
meet
him
and
he
was
received
like
a
conquering
hero
if
he
happened
to
bring
his
young
friend
boccaccio
the
story
teller
with
him
so
much
the
better
they
were
both
men
of
their
time
full
of
curiosity
willing
to
read
everything
once
digging
in
forgotten
and
musty
libraries
that
they
might
find
still
another
manuscript
of
virgil
or
ovid
or
lucrece
or
any
of
the
other
old
latin
poets
they
were
good
christians
of
course
they
were
everyone
was
but
no
need
of
going
around
with
a
long
face
and
wearing
a
dirty
coat
just
because
some
day
or
other
you
were
going
to
die
life
was
good
people
were
meant
to
be
happy
you
desired
proof
of
this
very
well
take
a
spade
and
dig
into
the
soil
what
did
you
find
beautiful
old
statues
beautiful
old
vases
ruins
of
ancient
buildings
all
these
things
were
made
by
the
people
of
the
greatest
empire
that
ever
existed
they
ruled
all
the
world
for
a
thousand
years
they
were
strong
and
rich
and
handsome
just
look
at
that
bust
of
the
emperor
augustus
of
course
they
were
not
christians
and
they
would
never
be
able
to
enter
heaven
at
best
they
would
spend
their
days
in
purgatory
where
dante
had
just
paid
them
a
visit
but
who
cared
to
have
lived
in
a
world
like
that
of
ancient
rome
was
heaven
enough
for
any
mortal
being
and
anyway
we
live
but
once
let
us
be
happy
and
cheerful
for
the
mere
joy
of
existence
such
in
short
was
the
spirit
that
had
begun
to
fill
the
narrow
and
crooked
streets
of
the
many
little
italian
cities
you
know
what
we
mean
by
the
bicycle
craze
or
the
automobile
craze
some
one
invents
a
bicycle
people
who
for
hundreds
of
thousands
of
years
have
moved
slowly
and
painfully
from
one
place
to
another
go
crazy
over
the
prospect
of
rolling
rapidly
and
easily
over
hill
and
dale
then
a
clever
mechanic
makes
the
first
automobile
no
longer
is
it
necessary
to
pedal
and
pedal
and
pedal
you
just
sit
and
let
little
drops
of
gasoline
do
the
work
for
you
then
everybody
wants
an
automobile
everybody
talks
about
and
flivvers
and
carburetors
and
mileage
and
oil
explorers
penetrate
into
the
hearts
of
unknown
countries
that
they
may
find
new
supplies
of
gas
forests
arise
in
sumatra
and
in
the
congo
to
supply
us
with
rubber
rubber
and
oil
become
so
valuable
that
people
fight
wars
for
their
possession
the
whole
world
is
automobile
mad
and
little
children
can
say
car
before
they
learn
to
whisper
papa
and
mamma
in
the
fourteenth
century
the
italian
people
went
crazy
about
the
newly
discovered
beauties
of
the
buried
world
of
rome
soon
their
enthusiasm
was
shared
by
all
the
people
of
western
europe
the
finding
of
an
unknown
manuscript
became
the
excuse
for
a
civic
holiday
the
man
who
wrote
a
grammar
became
as
popular
as
the
fellow
who
nowadays
invents
a
new
the
humanist
the
scholar
who
devoted
his
time
and
his
energies
to
a
study
of
homo
or
mankind
instead
of
wasting
his
hours
upon
fruitless
theological
investigations
that
man
was
regarded
with
greater
honour
and
a
deeper
respect
than
was
ever
bestowed
upon
a
hero
who
had
just
conquered
all
the
cannibal
islands
in
the
midst
of
this
intellectual
upheaval
an
event
occurred
which
greatly
favoured
the
study
of
the
ancient
philosophers
and
authors
the
turks
were
renewing
their
attacks
upon
europe
constantinople
capital
of
the
last
remnant
of
the
original
roman
empire
was
hard
pressed
in
the
year
the
emperor
manuel
paleologue
sent
emmanuel
chrysoloras
to
western
europe
to
explain
the
desperate
state
of
old
byzantium
and
to
ask
for
aid
this
aid
never
came
the
roman
catholic
world
was
more
than
willing
to
see
the
greek
catholic
world
go
to
the
punishment
that
awaited
such
wicked
heretics
but
however
indifferent
western
europe
might
be
to
the
fate
of
the
byzantines
they
were
greatly
interested
in
the
ancient
greeks
whose
colonists
had
founded
the
city
on
the
bosphorus
ten
centuries
after
the
trojan
war
they
wanted
to
learn
greek
that
they
might
read
aristotle
and
homer
and
plato
they
wanted
to
learn
it
very
badly
but
they
had
no
books
and
no
grammars
and
no
teachers
the
magistrates
of
florence
heard
of
the
visit
of
chrysoloras
the
people
of
their
city
were
crazy
to
learn
greek
would
he
please
come
and
teach
them
he
would
and
behold
the
first
professor
of
greek
teaching
alpha
beta
gamma
to
hundreds
of
eager
young
men
begging
their
way
to
the
city
of
the
arno
living
in
stables
and
in
dingy
attics
that
they
night
learn
how
to
decline
the
verb
gr
paidenw
paideneis
paidenei
and
enter
into
the
companionship
of
sophocles
and
homer
meanwhile
in
the
universities
the
old
schoolmen
teaching
their
ancient
theology
and
their
antiquated
logic
explaining
the
hidden
mysteries
of
the
old
testament
and
discussing
the
strange
science
of
their
edition
of
aristotle
looked
on
in
dismay
and
horror
next
they
turned
angry
this
thing
was
going
too
far
the
young
men
were
deserting
the
lecture
halls
of
the
established
universities
to
go
and
listen
to
some
humanist
with
his
newfangled
notions
about
a
reborn
civilization
they
went
to
the
authorities
they
complained
but
one
can
not
force
an
unwilling
horse
to
drink
and
one
can
not
make
unwilling
ears
listen
to
something
which
does
not
really
interest
them
the
schoolmen
were
losing
ground
rapidly
here
and
there
they
scored
a
short
victory
they
combined
forces
with
those
fanatics
who
hated
to
see
other
people
enjoy
a
happiness
which
was
foreign
to
their
own
souls
in
florence
the
centre
of
the
great
rebirth
a
terrible
fight
was
fought
between
the
old
order
and
the
new
a
dominican
monk
sour
of
face
and
bitter
in
his
hatred
of
beauty
was
the
leader
of
the
mediaeval
he
fought
a
valiant
battle
day
after
day
he
thundered
his
warnings
of
god
holy
wrath
through
the
wide
halls
of
santa
maria
del
fiore
repent
he
cried
repent
of
your
godlessness
of
your
joy
in
things
that
are
not
holy
he
began
to
hear
voices
and
to
see
flaming
swords
that
flashed
through
the
sky
he
preached
to
the
little
children
that
they
might
not
fall
into
the
errors
of
these
ways
which
were
leading
their
fathers
to
perdition
he
organised
companies
of
devoted
to
the
service
of
the
great
god
whose
prophet
he
claimed
to
be
in
a
sudden
moment
of
frenzy
the
frightened
people
promised
to
do
penance
for
their
wicked
love
of
beauty
and
pleasure
they
carried
their
books
and
their
statues
and
their
paintings
to
the
market
place
and
celebrated
a
wild
carnival
of
the
vanities
with
holy
singing
and
most
unholy
dancing
while
savonarola
applied
his
torch
to
the
accumulated
treasures
but
when
the
ashes
cooled
down
the
people
began
to
realise
what
they
had
lost
this
terrible
fanatic
had
made
them
destroy
that
which
they
had
come
to
love
above
all
things
they
turned
against
him
savonarola
was
thrown
into
jail
he
was
tortured
but
he
refused
to
repent
for
anything
he
had
done
he
was
an
honest
man
he
had
tried
to
live
a
holy
life
he
had
willingly
destroyed
those
who
deliberately
refused
to
share
his
own
point
of
view
it
had
been
his
duty
to
eradicate
evil
wherever
he
found
it
a
love
of
heathenish
books
and
heathenish
beauty
in
the
eyes
of
this
faithful
son
of
the
church
had
been
an
evil
but
he
stood
alone
he
had
fought
the
battle
of
a
time
that
was
dead
and
gone
the
pope
in
rome
never
moved
a
finger
to
save
him
on
the
contrary
he
approved
of
his
faithful
florentines
when
they
dragged
savonarola
to
the
gallows
hanged
him
and
burned
his
body
amidst
the
cheerful
howling
and
yelling
of
the
mob
it
was
a
sad
ending
but
quite
inevitable
savonarola
would
have
been
a
great
man
in
the
eleventh
century
in
the
fifteenth
century
he
was
merely
the
leader
of
a
lost
cause
for
better
or
worse
the
middle
ages
had
come
to
an
end
when
the
pope
had
turned
humanist
and
when
the
vatican
became
the
most
important
museum
of
roman
and
greek
antiquities
the
age
of
expression
the
people
began
to
feel
the
need
of
giving
expression
to
their
newly
discovered
joy
of
living
they
expressed
their
happiness
in
poetry
and
in
sculpture
and
in
architecture
and
in
painting
and
in
the
books
they
printed
in
the
year
there
died
a
pious
old
man
who
had
spent
of
his
years
behind
the
sheltering
walls
of
the
cloister
of
mount
agnes
near
the
good
town
of
zwolle
the
old
dutch
hanseatic
city
on
the
river
ysel
he
was
known
as
brother
thomas
and
because
he
had
been
born
in
the
village
of
kempen
he
was
called
thomas
a
kempis
at
the
age
of
twelve
he
had
been
sent
to
deventer
where
gerhard
groot
a
brilliant
graduate
of
the
universities
of
paris
cologne
and
prague
and
famous
as
a
wandering
preacher
had
founded
the
society
of
the
brothers
of
the
common
life
the
good
brothers
were
humble
laymen
who
tried
to
live
the
simple
life
of
the
early
apostles
of
christ
while
working
at
their
regular
jobs
as
carpenters
and
and
stone
masons
they
maintained
an
excellent
school
that
deserving
boys
of
poor
parents
might
be
taught
the
wisdom
of
the
fathers
of
the
church
at
this
school
little
thomas
had
learned
how
to
conjugate
latin
verbs
and
how
to
copy
manuscripts
then
he
had
taken
his
vows
had
put
his
little
bundle
of
books
upon
his
back
had
wandered
to
zwolle
and
with
a
sigh
of
relief
he
had
closed
the
door
upon
a
turbulent
world
which
did
not
attract
him
thomas
lived
in
an
age
of
turmoil
pestilence
and
sudden
death
in
central
europe
in
bohemia
the
devoted
disciples
of
johannus
huss
the
friend
and
follower
of
john
wycliffe
the
english
reformer
were
avenging
with
a
terrible
warfare
the
death
of
their
beloved
leader
who
had
been
burned
at
the
stake
by
order
of
that
same
council
of
constance
which
had
promised
him
a
if
he
would
come
to
switzerland
and
explain
his
doctrines
to
the
pope
the
emperor
cardinals
archbishops
and
bishops
one
hundred
and
fifty
abbots
and
more
than
a
hundred
princes
and
dukes
who
had
gathered
together
to
reform
their
church
in
the
west
france
had
been
fighting
for
a
hundred
years
that
she
might
drive
the
english
from
her
territories
and
just
then
was
saved
from
utter
defeat
by
the
fortunate
appearance
of
joan
of
arc
and
no
sooner
had
this
struggle
come
to
an
end
than
france
and
burgundy
were
at
each
other
throats
engaged
upon
a
struggle
of
life
and
death
for
the
supremacy
of
western
europe
in
the
south
a
pope
at
rome
was
calling
the
curses
of
heaven
down
upon
a
second
pope
who
resided
at
avignon
in
southern
france
and
who
retaliated
in
kind
in
the
far
east
the
turks
were
destroying
the
last
remnants
of
the
roman
empire
and
the
russians
had
started
upon
a
final
crusade
to
crush
the
power
of
their
tartar
masters
but
of
all
this
brother
thomas
in
his
quiet
cell
never
heard
he
had
his
manuscripts
and
his
own
thoughts
and
he
was
contented
he
poured
his
love
of
god
into
a
little
volume
he
called
it
the
imitation
of
christ
it
has
since
been
translated
into
more
languages
than
any
other
book
save
the
bible
it
has
been
read
by
quite
as
many
people
as
ever
studied
the
holy
scriptures
it
has
influenced
the
lives
of
countless
millions
and
it
was
the
work
of
a
man
whose
highest
ideal
of
existence
was
expressed
in
the
simple
wish
that
he
might
quietly
spend
his
days
sitting
in
a
little
corner
with
a
little
book
good
brother
thomas
represented
the
purest
ideals
of
the
middle
ages
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
the
forces
of
the
victorious
renaissance
with
the
humanists
loudly
proclaiming
the
coming
of
modern
times
the
middle
ages
gathered
strength
for
a
last
sally
monasteries
were
reformed
monks
gave
up
the
habits
of
riches
and
vice
simple
straightforward
and
honest
men
by
the
example
of
their
blameless
and
devout
lives
tried
to
bring
the
people
back
to
the
ways
of
righteousness
and
humble
resignation
to
the
will
of
god
but
all
to
no
avail
the
new
world
rushed
past
these
good
people
the
days
of
quiet
meditation
were
gone
the
great
era
of
expression
had
begun
here
and
now
let
me
say
that
i
am
sorry
that
i
must
use
so
many
big
words
i
wish
that
i
could
write
this
history
in
words
of
one
syllable
but
it
can
not
be
done
you
can
not
write
a
of
geometry
without
reference
to
a
hypotenuse
and
triangles
and
a
rectangular
parallelopiped
you
simply
have
to
learn
what
those
words
mean
or
do
without
mathematics
in
history
and
in
all
life
you
will
eventually
be
obliged
to
learn
the
meaning
of
many
strange
words
of
latin
and
greek
origin
why
not
do
it
now
when
i
say
that
the
renaissance
was
an
era
of
expression
i
mean
this
people
were
no
longer
contented
to
be
the
audience
and
sit
still
while
the
emperor
and
the
pope
told
them
what
to
do
and
what
to
think
they
wanted
to
be
actors
upon
the
stage
of
life
they
insisted
upon
giving
expression
to
their
own
individual
ideas
if
a
man
happened
to
be
interested
in
statesmanship
like
the
florentine
historian
niccolo
macchiavelli
then
he
expressed
himself
in
his
books
which
revealed
his
own
idea
of
a
successful
state
and
an
efficient
ruler
if
on
the
other
hand
he
had
a
liking
for
painting
he
expressed
his
love
for
beautiful
lines
and
lovely
colours
in
the
pictures
which
have
made
the
names
of
giotto
fra
angelico
rafael
and
a
thousand
others
household
words
wherever
people
have
learned
to
care
for
those
things
which
express
a
true
and
lasting
beauty
if
this
love
for
colour
and
line
happened
to
be
combined
with
an
interest
in
mechanics
and
hydraulics
the
result
was
a
leonardo
da
vinci
who
painted
his
pictures
experimented
with
his
balloons
and
flying
machines
drained
the
marshes
of
the
lombardian
plains
and
expressed
his
joy
and
interest
in
all
things
between
heaven
and
earth
in
prose
in
painting
in
sculpture
and
in
curiously
conceived
engines
when
a
man
of
gigantic
strength
like
michael
angelo
found
the
brush
and
the
palette
too
soft
for
his
strong
hands
he
turned
to
sculpture
and
to
architecture
and
hacked
the
most
terrific
creatures
out
of
heavy
blocks
of
marble
and
drew
the
plans
for
the
church
of
peter
the
most
concrete
expression
of
the
glories
of
the
triumphant
church
and
so
it
went
all
italy
and
very
soon
all
of
europe
was
filled
with
men
and
women
who
lived
that
they
might
add
their
mite
to
the
sum
total
of
our
accumulated
treasures
of
knowledge
and
beauty
and
wisdom
in
germany
in
the
city
of
mainz
johann
zum
gansefleisch
commonly
known
as
johann
gutenberg
had
just
invented
a
new
method
of
copying
books
he
had
studied
the
old
woodcuts
and
had
perfected
a
system
by
which
individual
letters
of
soft
lead
could
be
placed
in
such
a
way
that
they
formed
words
and
whole
pages
it
is
true
he
soon
lost
all
his
money
in
a
which
had
to
do
with
the
original
invention
of
the
press
he
died
in
poverty
but
the
expression
of
his
particular
inventive
genius
lived
after
him
soon
aldus
in
venice
and
etienne
in
paris
and
plantin
in
antwerp
and
froben
in
basel
were
flooding
the
world
with
carefully
edited
editions
of
the
classics
printed
in
the
gothic
letters
of
the
gutenberg
bible
or
printed
in
the
italian
type
which
we
use
in
this
book
or
printed
in
greek
letters
or
in
hebrew
then
the
whole
world
became
the
eager
audience
of
those
who
had
something
to
say
the
day
when
learning
had
been
a
monopoly
of
a
privileged
few
came
to
an
end
and
the
last
excuse
for
ignorance
was
removed
from
this
world
when
elzevier
of
haarlem
began
to
print
his
cheap
and
popular
editions
then
aristotle
and
plato
virgil
and
horace
and
pliny
all
the
goodly
company
of
the
ancient
authors
and
philosophers
and
scientists
offered
to
become
man
faithful
friend
in
exchange
for
a
few
paltry
pennies
humanism
had
made
all
men
free
and
equal
before
the
printed
word
the
great
discoveries
but
now
that
people
had
broken
through
the
bonds
of
their
narrow
mediaeval
limitations
they
had
to
have
more
room
for
their
wanderings
the
european
world
had
grown
too
small
for
their
ambitions
it
was
the
time
of
the
great
voyages
of
discovery
the
crusades
had
been
a
lesson
in
the
liberal
art
of
travelling
but
very
few
people
had
ever
ventured
beyond
the
beaten
track
which
led
from
venice
to
jaffe
in
the
thirteenth
century
the
polo
brothers
merchants
of
venice
had
wandered
across
the
great
mongolian
desert
and
after
climbing
mountains
as
high
as
the
moon
they
had
found
their
way
to
the
court
of
the
great
khan
of
cathay
the
mighty
emperor
of
china
the
son
of
one
of
the
polos
by
the
name
of
marco
had
written
a
book
about
their
adventures
which
covered
a
period
of
more
than
twenty
years
the
astonished
world
had
gaped
at
his
descriptions
of
the
golden
towers
of
the
strange
island
of
zipangu
which
was
his
italian
way
of
spelling
japan
many
people
had
wanted
to
go
east
that
they
might
find
this
and
grow
rich
but
the
trip
was
too
far
and
too
dangerous
and
so
they
stayed
at
home
of
course
there
was
always
the
possibility
of
making
the
voyage
by
sea
but
the
sea
was
very
unpopular
in
the
middle
ages
and
for
many
very
good
reasons
in
the
first
place
ships
were
very
small
the
vessels
on
which
magellan
made
his
famous
trip
around
the
world
which
lasted
many
years
were
not
as
large
as
a
modern
ferryboat
they
carried
from
twenty
to
fifty
men
who
lived
in
dingy
quarters
too
low
to
allow
any
of
them
to
stand
up
straight
and
the
sailors
were
obliged
to
eat
poorly
cooked
food
as
the
kitchen
arrangements
were
very
bad
and
no
fire
could
be
made
whenever
the
weather
was
the
least
bit
rough
the
mediaeval
world
knew
how
to
pickle
herring
and
how
to
dry
fish
but
there
were
no
canned
goods
and
fresh
vegetables
were
never
seen
on
the
bill
of
fare
as
soon
as
the
coast
had
been
left
behind
water
was
carried
in
small
barrels
it
soon
became
stale
and
then
tasted
of
rotten
wood
and
iron
rust
and
was
full
of
slimy
growing
things
as
the
people
of
the
middle
ages
knew
nothing
about
microbes
roger
bacon
the
learned
monk
of
the
thirteenth
century
seems
to
have
suspected
their
existence
but
he
wisely
kept
his
discovery
to
himself
they
often
drank
unclean
water
and
sometimes
the
whole
crew
died
of
typhoid
fever
indeed
the
mortality
on
board
the
ships
of
the
earliest
navigators
was
terrible
of
the
two
hundred
sailors
who
in
the
year
left
seville
to
accompany
magellan
on
his
famous
voyage
around
the
world
only
eighteen
returned
as
late
as
the
seventeenth
century
when
there
was
a
brisk
trade
between
western
europe
and
the
indies
a
mortality
of
percent
was
nothing
unusual
for
a
trip
from
amsterdam
to
batavia
and
back
the
greater
part
of
these
victims
died
of
scurvy
a
disease
which
is
caused
by
lack
of
fresh
vegetables
and
which
affects
the
gums
and
poisons
the
blood
until
the
patient
dies
of
sheer
exhaustion
under
those
circumstances
you
will
understand
that
the
sea
did
not
attract
the
best
elements
of
the
population
famous
discoverers
like
magellan
and
columbus
and
vasco
da
gama
travelled
at
the
head
of
crews
that
were
almost
entirely
composed
of
future
murderers
and
pickpockets
out
of
a
job
these
navigators
certainly
deserve
our
admiration
for
the
courage
and
the
pluck
with
which
they
accomplished
their
hopeless
tasks
in
the
face
of
difficulties
of
which
the
people
of
our
own
comfortable
world
can
have
no
conception
their
ships
were
leaky
the
rigging
was
clumsy
since
the
middle
of
the
thirteenth
century
they
had
possessed
some
sort
of
a
compass
which
had
come
to
europe
from
china
by
way
of
arabia
and
the
crusades
but
they
had
very
bad
and
incorrect
maps
they
set
their
course
by
god
and
by
guess
if
luck
was
with
them
they
returned
after
one
or
two
or
three
years
in
the
other
case
their
bleeched
bones
remained
behind
on
some
lonely
beach
but
they
were
true
pioneers
they
gambled
with
luck
life
to
them
was
a
glorious
adventure
and
all
the
suffering
the
thirst
and
the
hunger
and
the
pain
were
forgotten
when
their
eyes
beheld
the
dim
outlines
of
a
new
coast
or
the
placid
waters
of
an
ocean
that
had
lain
forgotten
since
the
beginning
of
time
again
i
wish
that
i
could
make
this
book
a
thousand
pages
long
the
subject
of
the
early
discoveries
is
so
fascinating
but
history
to
give
you
a
true
idea
of
past
times
should
be
like
those
etchings
which
rembrandt
used
to
make
it
should
cast
a
vivid
light
on
certain
important
causes
on
those
which
are
best
and
greatest
all
the
rest
should
be
left
in
the
shadow
or
should
be
indicated
by
a
few
lines
and
in
this
chapter
i
can
only
give
you
a
short
list
of
the
most
important
discoveries
keep
in
mind
that
all
during
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
centuries
the
navigators
were
trying
to
accomplish
just
one
thing
they
wanted
to
find
a
comfortable
and
safe
road
to
the
empire
of
cathay
china
to
the
island
of
zipangu
japan
and
to
those
mysterious
islands
where
grew
the
spices
which
the
mediaeval
world
had
come
to
like
since
the
days
of
the
crusades
and
which
people
needed
in
those
days
before
the
introduction
of
cold
storage
when
meat
and
fish
spoiled
very
quickly
and
could
only
be
eaten
after
a
liberal
sprinkling
of
pepper
or
nutmeg
the
venetians
and
the
genoese
had
been
the
great
navigators
of
the
mediterranean
but
the
honour
for
exploring
the
coast
of
the
atlantic
goes
to
the
portuguese
spain
and
portugal
were
full
of
that
patriotic
energy
which
their
struggle
against
the
moorish
invaders
had
developed
such
energy
once
it
exists
can
easily
be
forced
into
new
channels
in
the
thirteenth
century
king
alphonso
iii
had
conquered
the
kingdom
of
algarve
in
the
southwestern
corner
of
the
spanish
peninsula
and
had
added
it
to
his
dominions
in
the
next
century
the
portuguese
had
turned
the
tables
on
the
mohammedans
had
crossed
the
straits
of
gibraltar
and
had
taken
possession
of
ceuta
opposite
the
arabic
city
of
a
word
which
in
arabic
means
inventory
and
which
by
way
of
the
spanish
language
has
come
down
to
us
as
tariff
and
tangiers
which
became
the
capital
of
an
african
addition
to
algarve
they
were
ready
to
begin
their
career
as
explorers
in
the
year
prince
henry
known
as
henry
the
navigator
the
son
of
john
i
of
portugal
and
philippa
the
daughter
of
john
of
gaunt
about
whom
you
can
read
in
richard
ii
a
play
by
william
shakespeare
began
to
make
preparations
for
the
systematic
exploration
of
northwestern
africa
before
this
that
hot
and
sandy
coast
had
been
visited
by
the
phoenicians
and
by
the
norsemen
who
remembered
it
as
the
home
of
the
hairy
wild
man
whom
we
have
come
to
know
as
the
gorilla
one
after
another
prince
henry
and
his
captains
discovered
the
canary
islands
the
island
of
madeira
which
a
century
before
had
been
visited
by
a
genoese
ship
carefully
charted
the
azores
which
had
been
vaguely
known
to
both
the
portuguese
and
the
spaniards
and
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
mouth
of
the
senegal
river
on
the
west
coast
of
africa
which
they
supposed
to
be
the
western
mouth
of
the
nile
at
last
by
the
middle
of
the
fifteenth
century
they
saw
cape
verde
or
the
green
cape
and
the
cape
verde
islands
which
lie
almost
halfway
between
the
coast
of
africa
and
brazil
but
henry
did
not
restrict
himself
in
his
investigations
to
the
waters
of
the
ocean
he
was
grand
master
of
the
order
of
christ
this
was
a
portuguese
continuation
of
the
crusading
order
of
the
templars
which
had
been
abolished
by
pope
clement
v
in
the
year
at
the
request
of
king
philip
the
fair
of
france
who
had
improved
the
occasion
by
burning
his
own
templars
at
the
stake
and
stealing
all
their
possessions
prince
henry
used
the
revenues
of
the
domains
of
his
religious
order
to
equip
several
expeditions
which
explored
the
hinterland
of
the
sahara
and
of
the
coast
of
guinea
but
he
was
still
very
much
a
son
of
the
middle
ages
and
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
and
wasted
a
lot
of
money
upon
a
search
for
the
mysterious
presser
john
the
mythical
christian
priest
who
was
said
to
be
the
emperor
of
a
vast
empire
situated
somewhere
in
the
east
the
story
of
this
strange
potentate
had
first
been
told
in
europe
in
the
middle
of
the
twelfth
century
for
three
hundred
years
people
had
tried
to
find
presser
john
and
his
descendants
henry
took
part
in
the
search
thirty
years
after
his
death
the
riddle
was
solved
in
the
year
bartholomew
diaz
trying
to
find
the
land
of
prester
john
by
sea
had
reached
the
southernmost
point
of
africa
at
first
he
called
it
the
storm
cape
on
account
of
the
strong
winds
which
had
prevented
him
from
continuing
his
voyage
toward
the
east
but
the
lisbon
pilots
who
understood
the
importance
of
this
discovery
in
their
quest
for
the
india
water
route
changed
the
name
into
that
of
the
cape
of
good
hope
one
year
later
pedro
de
covilham
provided
with
letters
of
credit
on
the
house
of
medici
started
upon
a
similar
mission
by
land
he
crossed
the
mediterranean
and
after
leaving
egypt
he
travelled
southward
he
reached
aden
and
from
there
travelling
through
the
waters
of
the
persian
gulf
which
few
white
men
had
seen
since
the
days
of
alexander
the
great
eighteen
centuries
before
he
visited
goa
and
calicut
on
the
coast
of
india
where
he
got
a
great
deal
of
news
about
the
island
of
the
moon
madagascar
which
was
supposed
to
lie
halfway
between
africa
and
india
then
he
returned
paid
a
secret
visit
to
mecca
and
to
medina
crossed
the
red
sea
once
more
and
in
the
year
he
discovered
the
realm
of
prester
john
who
was
no
one
less
than
the
black
negus
or
king
of
abyssinia
whose
ancestors
had
adopted
christianity
in
the
fourth
century
seven
hundred
years
before
the
christian
missionaries
had
found
their
way
to
scandinavia
these
many
voyages
had
convinced
the
portuguese
geographers
and
cartographers
that
while
the
voyage
to
the
indies
by
an
eastern
was
possible
it
was
by
no
means
easy
then
there
arose
a
great
debate
some
people
wanted
to
continue
the
explorations
east
of
the
cape
of
good
hope
others
said
no
we
must
sail
west
across
the
atlantic
and
then
we
shall
reach
cathay
let
us
state
right
here
that
most
intelligent
people
of
that
day
were
firmly
convinced
that
the
earth
was
not
as
flat
as
a
pancake
but
was
round
the
ptolemean
system
of
the
universe
invented
and
duly
described
by
claudius
ptolemy
the
great
egyptian
geographer
who
had
lived
in
the
second
century
of
our
era
which
had
served
the
simple
needs
of
the
men
of
the
middle
ages
had
long
been
discarded
by
the
scientists
of
the
renaissance
they
had
accepted
the
doctrine
of
the
polish
mathematician
nicolaus
copernicus
whose
studies
had
convinced
him
that
the
earth
was
one
of
a
number
of
round
planets
which
turned
around
the
sun
a
discovery
which
he
did
not
venture
to
publish
for
years
it
was
printed
in
the
year
of
his
death
from
fear
of
the
holy
inquisition
a
papal
court
which
had
been
established
in
the
thirteenth
century
when
the
heresies
of
the
albigenses
and
the
waldenses
in
france
and
in
italy
very
mild
heresies
of
devoutly
pious
people
who
did
not
believe
in
private
property
and
preferred
to
live
in
poverty
had
for
a
moment
threatened
the
absolute
power
of
the
bishops
of
rome
but
the
belief
in
the
roundness
of
the
earth
was
common
among
the
nautical
experts
and
as
i
said
they
were
now
debating
the
respective
advantages
of
the
eastern
and
the
western
routes
among
the
advocates
of
the
western
route
was
a
genoese
mariner
by
the
name
of
cristoforo
colombo
he
was
the
son
of
a
wool
merchant
he
seems
to
have
been
a
student
at
the
university
of
pavia
where
he
specialised
in
mathematics
and
geometry
then
he
took
up
his
father
trade
but
soon
we
find
him
in
chios
in
the
eastern
mediterranean
travelling
on
business
thereafter
we
hear
of
voyages
to
england
but
whether
he
went
north
in
search
of
wool
or
as
the
captain
of
a
ship
we
do
not
know
in
february
of
the
year
colombo
if
we
are
to
believe
his
own
words
visited
iceland
but
very
likely
he
only
got
as
far
as
the
faroe
islands
which
are
cold
enough
in
february
to
be
mistaken
for
iceland
by
any
one
here
colombo
met
the
descendants
of
those
brave
norsemen
who
in
the
tenth
century
had
settled
in
greenland
and
who
had
visited
america
in
the
eleventh
century
when
leif
vessel
had
been
blown
to
the
coast
of
vineland
or
labrador
what
had
become
of
those
far
western
colonies
no
one
knew
the
american
colony
of
thorfinn
karlsefne
the
husband
of
the
widow
of
leif
brother
thorstein
founded
in
the
year
had
been
discontinued
three
years
later
on
account
of
the
hostility
of
the
esquimaux
as
for
greenland
not
a
word
had
been
heard
from
the
settlers
since
the
year
very
likely
the
greenlanders
had
all
died
of
the
black
death
which
had
just
killed
half
the
people
of
norway
however
that
might
be
the
tradition
of
a
vast
land
in
the
distant
west
still
survived
among
the
people
of
the
faroe
and
iceland
and
colombo
must
have
heard
of
it
he
gathered
further
information
among
the
fishermen
of
the
northern
scottish
islands
and
then
went
to
portugal
where
he
married
the
daughter
of
one
of
the
captains
who
had
served
under
prince
henry
the
navigator
from
that
moment
on
the
year
he
devoted
himself
to
the
quest
of
the
western
route
to
the
indies
he
sent
his
plans
for
such
a
voyage
to
the
courts
of
portugal
and
spain
the
portuguese
who
felt
certain
that
they
possessed
a
monopoly
of
the
eastern
route
would
not
listen
to
his
plans
in
spain
ferdinand
of
aragon
and
isabella
of
castile
whose
marriage
in
had
made
spain
into
a
single
kingdom
were
busy
driving
the
moors
from
their
last
stronghold
granada
they
had
no
money
for
risky
expeditions
they
needed
every
peseta
for
their
soldiers
few
people
were
ever
forced
to
fight
as
desperately
for
their
ideas
as
this
brave
italian
but
the
story
of
colombo
or
colon
or
columbus
as
we
call
him
is
too
well
known
to
bear
repeating
the
moors
surrendered
granada
on
the
second
of
january
of
the
year
in
the
month
of
april
of
the
same
year
columbus
signed
a
contract
with
the
king
and
queen
of
spain
on
friday
the
of
august
he
left
palos
with
three
little
ships
and
a
crew
of
men
many
of
whom
were
criminals
who
had
been
offered
indemnity
of
punishment
if
they
joined
the
expedition
at
two
in
the
morning
of
friday
the
of
october
columbus
discovered
land
on
the
fourth
of
january
of
the
year
columbus
waved
farewell
to
the
men
of
the
little
fortress
of
la
navidad
none
of
whom
was
ever
again
seen
alive
and
returned
homeward
by
the
middle
of
february
he
reached
the
azores
where
the
portuguese
threatened
to
throw
him
into
gaol
on
the
fifteenth
of
march
the
admiral
reached
palos
and
together
with
his
indians
for
he
was
convinced
that
he
had
discovered
some
outlying
islands
of
the
indies
and
called
the
natives
red
indians
he
hastened
to
barcelona
to
tell
his
faithful
patrons
that
he
had
been
successful
and
that
the
road
to
the
gold
and
the
silver
of
cathay
and
zipangu
was
at
the
disposal
of
their
most
catholic
majesties
alas
columbus
never
knew
the
truth
towards
the
end
of
his
life
on
his
fourth
voyage
when
he
had
touched
the
mainland
of
south
america
he
may
have
suspected
that
all
was
not
well
with
his
discovery
but
he
died
in
the
firm
belief
that
there
was
no
solid
continent
between
europe
and
asia
and
that
he
had
found
the
direct
route
to
china
meanwhile
the
portuguese
sticking
to
their
eastern
route
had
been
more
fortunate
in
the
year
vasco
da
gama
had
been
able
to
reach
the
coast
of
malabar
and
return
safely
to
lisbon
with
a
cargo
of
spice
in
the
year
he
had
repeated
the
visit
but
along
the
western
route
the
work
of
exploration
had
been
most
disappointing
in
and
john
and
sebastian
cabot
had
tried
to
find
a
passage
to
japan
but
they
had
seen
nothing
but
the
snowbound
coasts
and
the
rocks
of
newfoundland
which
had
first
been
sighted
by
the
northmen
five
centuries
before
amerigo
vespucci
a
florentine
who
became
the
pilot
major
of
spain
and
who
gave
his
name
to
our
continent
had
explored
the
coast
of
brazil
but
had
found
not
a
trace
of
the
indies
in
the
year
seven
years
after
the
death
of
columbus
the
truth
at
last
began
to
dawn
upon
the
geographers
of
europe
vasco
nunez
de
balboa
had
crossed
the
isthmus
of
panama
had
climbed
the
famous
peak
in
darien
and
had
looked
down
upon
a
vast
expanse
of
water
which
seemed
to
suggest
the
existence
of
another
ocean
finally
in
the
year
a
fleet
of
five
small
spanish
ships
under
command
of
the
portuguese
navigator
ferdinand
de
magellan
sailed
westward
and
not
eastward
since
that
route
was
absolutely
in
the
hands
of
the
portuguese
who
allowed
no
competition
in
search
of
the
spice
islands
magellan
crossed
the
atlantic
between
africa
and
brazil
and
sailed
southward
he
reached
a
narrow
channel
between
the
southernmost
point
of
patagonia
the
land
of
the
people
with
the
big
feet
and
the
fire
island
so
named
on
account
of
a
fire
the
only
sign
of
the
existence
of
natives
which
the
sailors
watched
one
night
for
almost
five
weeks
the
ships
of
magellan
were
at
the
mercy
of
the
terrible
storms
and
blizzards
which
swept
through
the
straits
a
mutiny
broke
out
among
the
sailors
magellan
suppressed
it
with
terrible
severity
and
sent
two
of
his
men
on
shore
where
they
were
left
to
repent
of
their
sins
at
leisure
at
last
the
storms
quieted
down
the
channel
broadened
and
magellan
entered
a
new
ocean
its
waves
were
quiet
and
placid
he
called
it
the
peaceful
sea
the
mare
pacifico
then
he
continued
in
a
western
direction
he
sailed
for
days
without
seeing
land
his
people
almost
perished
from
hunger
and
thirst
and
ate
the
rats
that
infested
the
ships
and
when
these
were
all
gone
they
chewed
pieces
of
sail
to
still
their
gnawing
hunger
in
march
of
the
year
they
saw
land
magellan
called
it
the
land
of
the
ladrones
which
means
robbers
because
the
natives
stole
everything
they
could
lay
hands
on
then
further
westward
to
the
spice
islands
again
land
was
sighted
a
group
of
lonely
islands
magellan
called
them
the
philippines
after
philip
the
son
of
his
master
charles
v
the
philip
ii
of
unpleasant
historical
memory
at
first
magellan
was
well
received
but
when
he
used
the
guns
of
his
ships
to
make
christian
converts
he
was
killed
by
the
aborigines
together
with
a
number
of
his
captains
and
sailors
the
survivors
burned
one
of
the
three
remaining
ships
and
continued
their
voyage
they
found
the
moluccas
the
famous
spice
islands
they
sighted
borneo
and
reached
tidor
there
one
of
the
two
ships
too
leaky
to
be
of
further
use
remained
behind
with
her
crew
the
vittoria
under
sebastian
del
cano
crossed
the
indian
ocean
missed
seeing
the
northern
coast
of
australia
which
was
not
discovered
until
the
first
half
of
the
seventeenth
century
when
ships
of
the
dutch
east
india
company
explored
this
flat
and
inhospitable
land
and
after
great
hardships
reached
spain
this
was
the
most
notable
of
all
voyages
it
had
taken
three
years
it
had
been
accomplished
at
a
great
cost
both
of
men
and
money
but
it
had
established
the
fact
that
the
earth
was
round
and
that
the
new
lands
discovered
by
columbus
were
not
a
part
of
the
indies
but
a
separate
continent
from
that
time
on
spain
and
portugal
devoted
all
their
energies
to
the
development
of
their
indian
and
american
trade
to
prevent
an
armed
conflict
between
the
rivals
pope
alexander
vi
the
only
avowed
heathen
who
was
ever
elected
to
this
most
holy
office
had
obligingly
divided
the
world
into
two
equal
parts
by
a
line
of
demarcation
which
followed
the
degree
of
longitude
west
of
greenwich
the
division
of
tordesillas
of
the
portuguese
were
to
establish
their
colonies
to
the
east
of
this
line
the
spaniards
were
to
have
theirs
to
the
west
this
accounts
for
the
fact
that
the
entire
american
continent
with
the
exception
of
brazil
became
spanish
and
that
all
of
the
indies
and
most
of
africa
became
portuguese
until
the
english
and
the
dutch
colonists
who
had
no
respect
for
papal
decisions
took
these
possessions
away
in
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
when
news
of
the
discovery
of
columbus
reached
the
rialto
of
venice
the
wall
street
of
the
middle
ages
there
was
a
terrible
panic
stocks
and
bonds
went
down
and
percent
after
a
short
while
when
it
appeared
that
columbus
had
failed
to
find
the
road
to
cathay
the
venetian
merchants
recovered
from
their
fright
but
the
voyages
of
da
gama
and
magellan
proved
the
practical
possibilities
of
an
eastern
to
the
indies
then
the
rulers
of
genoa
and
venice
the
two
great
commercial
centres
of
the
middle
ages
and
the
renaissance
began
to
be
sorry
that
they
had
refused
to
listen
to
columbus
but
it
was
too
late
their
mediterranean
became
an
inland
sea
the
overland
trade
to
the
indies
and
china
dwindled
to
insignificant
proportions
the
old
days
of
italian
glory
were
gone
the
atlantic
became
the
new
centre
of
commerce
and
therefore
the
centre
of
civilisation
it
has
remained
so
ever
since
see
how
strangely
civilisation
has
progressed
since
those
early
days
fifty
centuries
before
when
the
inhabitants
of
the
valley
of
the
nile
began
to
keep
a
written
record
of
history
from
the
river
nile
it
went
to
mesopotamia
the
land
between
the
rivers
then
came
the
turn
of
crete
and
greece
and
rome
an
inland
sea
became
the
centre
of
trade
and
the
cities
along
the
mediterranean
were
the
home
of
art
and
science
and
philosophy
and
learning
in
the
sixteenth
century
it
moved
westward
once
more
and
made
the
countries
that
border
upon
the
atlantic
become
the
masters
of
the
earth
there
are
those
who
say
that
the
world
war
and
the
suicide
of
the
great
european
nations
has
greatly
diminished
the
importance
of
the
atlantic
ocean
they
expect
to
see
civilisation
cross
the
american
continent
and
find
a
new
home
in
the
pacific
but
i
doubt
this
the
westward
trip
was
accompanied
by
a
steady
increase
in
the
size
of
ships
and
a
broadening
of
the
knowledge
of
the
navigators
the
vessels
of
the
nile
and
the
euphrates
were
replaced
by
the
sailing
vessels
of
the
phoenicians
the
aegeans
the
greeks
the
carthaginians
and
the
romans
these
in
turn
were
discarded
for
the
square
rigged
vessels
of
the
portuguese
and
the
spaniards
and
the
latter
were
driven
from
the
ocean
by
the
craft
of
the
english
and
the
dutch
at
present
however
civilisation
no
longer
depends
upon
ships
aircraft
has
taken
and
will
continue
to
take
the
place
of
the
sailing
vessel
and
the
steamer
the
next
centre
of
civilisation
will
depend
upon
the
development
of
aircraft
and
water
power
and
the
sea
once
more
shall
be
the
undisturbed
home
of
the
little
fishes
who
once
upon
a
time
shared
their
deep
residence
with
the
earliest
ancestors
of
the
human
race
buddha
and
confucius
concerning
buddha
and
confucius
the
discoveries
of
the
portuguese
and
the
spaniards
had
brought
the
christians
of
western
europe
into
close
contact
with
the
people
of
india
and
of
china
they
knew
of
course
that
christianity
was
not
the
only
religion
on
this
earth
there
were
the
mohammedans
and
the
heathenish
tribes
of
northern
africa
who
worshipped
sticks
and
stones
and
dead
trees
but
in
india
and
in
china
the
christian
conquerors
found
new
millions
who
had
never
heard
of
christ
and
who
did
not
want
to
hear
of
him
because
they
thought
their
own
religion
which
was
thousands
of
years
old
much
better
than
that
of
the
west
as
this
is
a
story
of
mankind
and
not
an
exclusive
history
of
the
people
of
europe
and
our
western
hemisphere
you
ought
to
know
something
of
two
men
whose
teaching
and
whose
example
continue
to
influence
the
actions
and
the
thoughts
of
the
majority
of
our
on
this
earth
in
india
buddha
was
recognised
as
the
great
religious
teacher
his
history
is
an
interesting
one
he
was
born
in
the
sixth
century
before
the
birth
of
christ
within
sight
of
the
mighty
himalaya
mountains
where
four
hundred
years
before
zarathustra
or
zoroaster
the
first
of
the
great
leaders
of
the
aryan
race
the
name
which
the
eastern
branch
of
the
race
had
given
to
itself
had
taught
his
people
to
regard
life
as
a
continuous
struggle
between
ahriman
and
ormuzd
the
gods
of
evil
and
good
buddha
father
was
suddhodana
a
mighty
chief
among
the
tribe
of
the
sakiyas
his
mother
maha
maya
was
the
daughter
of
a
neighbouring
king
she
had
been
married
when
she
was
a
very
young
girl
but
many
moons
had
passed
beyond
the
distant
ridge
of
hills
and
still
her
husband
was
without
an
heir
who
should
rule
his
lands
after
him
at
last
when
she
was
fifty
years
old
her
day
came
and
she
went
forth
that
she
might
be
among
her
own
people
when
her
baby
should
come
into
this
world
it
was
a
long
trip
to
the
land
of
the
koliyans
where
maha
maya
had
spent
her
earliest
years
one
night
she
was
resting
among
the
cool
trees
of
the
garden
of
lumbini
there
her
son
was
born
he
was
given
the
name
of
siddhartha
but
we
know
him
as
buddha
which
means
the
enlightened
one
in
due
time
siddhartha
grew
up
to
be
a
handsome
young
prince
and
when
he
was
nineteen
years
old
he
was
married
to
his
cousin
yasodhara
during
the
next
ten
years
he
lived
far
away
from
all
pain
and
all
suffering
behind
the
protecting
walls
of
the
royal
palace
awaiting
the
day
when
he
should
succeed
his
father
as
king
of
the
sakiyas
but
it
happened
that
when
he
was
thirty
years
old
he
drove
outside
of
the
palace
gates
and
saw
a
man
who
was
old
and
worn
out
with
labour
and
whose
weak
limbs
could
hardly
carry
the
burden
of
life
siddhartha
pointed
him
out
to
his
coachman
channa
but
channa
answered
that
there
were
lots
of
poor
people
in
this
world
and
that
one
more
or
less
did
not
matter
the
young
prince
was
very
sad
but
he
did
not
say
anything
and
went
back
to
live
with
his
wife
and
his
father
and
his
mother
and
tried
to
be
happy
a
little
while
later
he
left
the
palace
a
second
time
his
carriage
met
a
man
who
suffered
from
a
terrible
disease
siddhartha
asked
channa
what
had
been
the
cause
of
this
man
suffering
but
the
coachman
answered
that
there
were
many
sick
people
in
this
world
and
that
such
things
could
not
be
helped
and
did
not
matter
very
much
the
young
prince
was
very
sad
when
he
heard
this
but
again
he
returned
to
his
people
a
few
weeks
passed
one
evening
siddhartha
ordered
his
carriage
in
order
to
go
to
the
river
and
bathe
suddenly
his
horses
were
frightened
by
the
sight
of
a
dead
man
whose
rotting
body
lay
sprawling
in
the
ditch
beside
the
road
the
young
prince
who
had
never
been
allowed
to
see
such
things
was
frightened
but
channa
told
him
not
to
mind
such
trifles
the
world
was
full
of
dead
people
it
was
the
rule
of
life
that
all
things
must
come
to
an
end
nothing
was
eternal
the
grave
awaited
us
all
and
there
was
no
escape
that
evening
when
siddhartha
returned
to
his
home
he
was
received
with
music
while
he
was
away
his
wife
had
given
birth
to
a
son
the
people
were
delighted
because
now
they
knew
that
there
was
an
heir
to
the
throne
and
they
celebrated
the
event
by
the
beating
of
many
drums
siddhartha
however
did
not
share
their
joy
the
curtain
of
life
had
been
lifted
and
he
had
learned
the
horror
of
man
existence
the
sight
of
death
and
suffering
followed
him
like
a
terrible
dream
that
night
the
moon
was
shining
brightly
siddhartha
woke
up
and
began
to
think
of
many
things
never
again
could
he
be
happy
until
he
should
have
found
a
solution
to
the
riddle
of
existence
he
decided
to
find
it
far
away
from
all
those
whom
he
loved
softly
he
went
into
the
room
where
yasodhara
was
sleeping
with
her
baby
then
he
called
for
his
faithful
channa
and
told
him
to
follow
together
the
two
men
went
into
the
darkness
of
the
night
one
to
find
rest
for
his
soul
the
other
to
be
a
faithful
servant
unto
a
beloved
master
the
people
of
india
among
whom
siddhartha
wandered
for
many
years
were
just
then
in
a
state
of
change
their
ancestors
the
native
indians
had
been
conquered
without
great
difficulty
by
the
aryans
our
distant
cousins
and
thereafter
the
aryans
had
been
the
rulers
and
masters
of
tens
of
millions
of
docile
little
brown
men
to
maintain
themselves
in
the
seat
of
the
mighty
they
had
divided
the
population
into
different
classes
and
gradually
a
system
of
caste
of
the
most
rigid
sort
had
been
enforced
upon
the
natives
the
descendants
of
the
conquerors
belonged
to
the
highest
caste
the
class
of
warriors
and
nobles
next
came
the
caste
of
the
priests
below
these
followed
the
peasants
and
the
business
men
the
ancient
natives
however
who
were
called
pariahs
formed
a
class
of
despised
and
miserable
slaves
and
never
could
hope
to
be
anything
else
even
the
religion
of
the
people
was
a
matter
of
caste
the
old
during
their
thousands
of
years
of
wandering
had
met
with
many
strange
adventures
these
had
been
collected
in
a
book
called
the
veda
the
language
of
this
book
was
called
sanskrit
and
it
was
closely
related
to
the
different
languages
of
the
european
continent
to
greek
and
latin
and
russian
and
german
and
others
the
three
highest
castes
were
allowed
to
read
these
holy
scriptures
the
pariah
however
the
despised
member
of
the
lowest
caste
was
not
permitted
to
know
its
contents
woe
to
the
man
of
noble
or
priestly
caste
who
should
teach
a
pariah
to
study
the
sacred
volume
the
majority
of
the
indian
people
therefore
lived
in
misery
since
this
planet
offered
them
very
little
joy
salvation
from
suffering
must
be
found
elsewhere
they
tried
to
derive
a
little
consolation
from
meditation
upon
the
bliss
of
their
future
existence
brahma
the
who
was
regarded
by
the
indian
people
as
the
supreme
ruler
of
life
and
death
was
worshipped
as
the
highest
ideal
of
perfection
to
become
like
brahma
to
lose
all
desires
for
riches
and
power
was
recognised
as
the
most
exalted
purpose
of
existence
holy
thoughts
were
regarded
as
more
important
than
holy
deeds
and
many
people
went
into
the
desert
and
lived
upon
the
leaves
of
trees
and
starved
their
bodies
that
they
might
feed
their
souls
with
the
glorious
contemplation
of
the
splendours
of
brahma
the
wise
the
good
and
the
merciful
siddhartha
who
had
often
observed
these
solitary
wanderers
who
were
seeking
the
truth
far
away
from
the
turmoil
of
the
cities
and
the
villages
decided
to
follow
their
example
he
cut
his
hair
he
took
his
pearls
and
his
rubies
and
sent
them
back
to
his
family
with
a
message
of
farewell
which
the
ever
faithful
channa
carried
without
a
single
follower
the
young
prince
then
moved
into
the
wilderness
soon
the
fame
of
his
holy
conduct
spread
among
the
mountains
five
young
men
came
to
him
and
asked
that
they
might
be
allowed
to
listen
to
his
words
of
wisdom
he
agreed
to
be
their
master
if
they
would
follow
him
they
consented
and
he
took
them
into
the
hills
and
for
six
years
he
taught
them
all
he
knew
amidst
the
lonely
peaks
of
the
vindhya
mountains
but
at
the
end
of
this
period
of
study
he
felt
that
he
was
still
far
from
perfection
the
world
that
he
had
left
continued
to
tempt
him
he
now
asked
that
his
pupils
leave
him
and
then
he
fasted
for
days
and
nights
sitting
upon
the
roots
of
an
old
tree
at
last
he
received
his
reward
in
the
dusk
of
the
fiftieth
evening
brahma
revealed
himself
to
his
faithful
servant
from
that
moment
on
siddhartha
was
called
buddha
and
he
was
revered
as
the
enlightened
one
who
had
come
to
save
men
from
their
unhappy
mortal
fate
the
last
years
of
his
life
buddha
spent
within
the
valley
of
the
ganges
river
teaching
his
simple
lesson
of
submission
and
meekness
unto
all
men
in
the
year
before
our
era
he
died
full
of
years
and
beloved
by
millions
of
people
he
had
not
preached
his
doctrines
for
the
benefit
of
a
single
class
even
the
lowest
pariah
might
call
himself
his
disciple
this
however
did
not
please
the
nobles
and
the
priests
and
the
merchants
who
did
their
best
to
destroy
a
creed
which
recognised
the
equality
of
all
living
creatures
and
offered
men
the
hope
of
a
second
life
a
reincarnation
under
happier
circumstances
as
soon
as
they
could
they
encouraged
the
people
of
india
to
return
to
the
ancient
doctrines
of
the
brahmin
creed
with
its
fasting
and
its
tortures
of
the
sinful
body
but
buddhism
could
not
be
destroyed
slowly
the
disciples
of
the
enlightened
one
wandered
across
the
valleys
of
the
himalayas
and
moved
into
china
they
crossed
the
yellow
sea
and
preached
the
wisdom
of
their
master
unto
the
people
of
japan
and
they
faithfully
obeyed
the
will
of
their
great
master
who
had
forbidden
them
to
use
force
more
people
recognise
buddha
as
their
teacher
than
ever
before
and
their
number
surpasses
that
of
the
combined
followers
of
christ
and
mohammed
as
for
confucius
the
wise
old
man
of
the
chinese
his
story
is
a
simple
one
he
was
born
in
the
year
he
led
a
quiet
dignified
and
uneventful
life
at
a
time
when
china
was
without
a
strong
central
government
and
when
the
chinese
people
were
at
the
mercy
of
bandits
and
who
went
from
city
to
city
pillaging
and
stealing
and
murdering
and
turning
the
busy
plains
of
northern
and
central
china
into
a
wilderness
of
starving
people
confucius
who
loved
his
people
tried
to
save
them
he
did
not
have
much
faith
in
the
use
of
violence
he
was
a
very
peaceful
person
he
did
not
think
that
he
could
make
people
over
by
giving
them
a
lot
of
new
laws
he
knew
that
the
only
possible
salvation
would
come
from
a
change
of
heart
and
he
set
out
upon
the
seemingly
hopeless
task
of
changing
the
character
of
his
millions
of
fellow
men
who
inhabited
the
wide
plains
of
eastern
asia
the
chinese
had
never
been
much
interested
in
religion
as
we
understand
that
word
they
believed
in
devils
and
spooks
as
most
primitive
people
do
but
they
had
no
prophets
and
recognised
no
revealed
truth
confucius
is
almost
the
only
one
among
the
great
moral
leaders
who
did
not
see
visions
who
did
not
proclaim
himself
as
the
messenger
of
a
divine
power
who
did
not
at
some
time
or
another
claim
that
he
was
inspired
by
voices
from
above
he
was
just
a
very
sensible
and
kindly
man
rather
given
to
lonely
wanderings
and
melancholy
tunes
upon
his
faithful
flute
he
asked
for
no
recognition
he
did
not
demand
that
any
one
should
follow
him
or
worship
him
he
reminds
us
of
the
ancient
greek
philosophers
especially
those
of
the
stoic
school
men
who
believed
in
right
living
and
righteous
thinking
without
the
hope
of
a
reward
but
simply
for
the
peace
of
the
soul
that
comes
with
a
good
conscience
confucius
was
a
very
tolerant
man
he
went
out
of
his
way
to
visit
the
other
great
chinese
leader
and
the
founder
of
a
philosophic
system
called
taoism
which
was
merely
an
early
chinese
version
of
the
golden
rule
confucius
bore
no
hatred
to
any
one
he
taught
the
virtue
of
supreme
a
person
of
real
worth
according
to
the
teaching
of
confucius
did
not
allow
himself
to
be
ruffled
by
anger
and
suffered
whatever
fate
brought
him
with
the
resignation
of
those
sages
who
understand
that
everything
which
happens
in
one
way
or
another
is
meant
for
the
best
at
first
he
had
only
a
few
students
gradually
the
number
increased
before
his
death
in
the
year
several
of
the
kings
and
the
princes
of
china
confessed
themselves
his
disciples
when
christ
was
born
in
bethlehem
the
philosophy
of
confucius
had
already
become
a
part
of
the
mental
of
most
chinamen
it
has
continued
to
influence
their
lives
ever
since
not
however
in
its
pure
original
form
most
religions
change
as
time
goes
on
christ
preached
humility
and
meekness
and
absence
from
worldly
ambitions
but
fifteen
centuries
after
golgotha
the
head
of
the
christian
church
was
spending
millions
upon
the
erection
of
a
building
that
bore
little
relation
to
the
lonely
stable
of
bethlehem
taught
the
golden
rule
and
in
less
than
three
centuries
the
ignorant
masses
had
made
him
into
a
real
and
very
cruel
god
and
had
buried
his
wise
commandments
under
a
of
superstition
which
made
the
lives
of
the
average
chinese
one
long
series
of
frights
and
fears
and
horrors
confucius
had
shown
his
students
the
beauties
of
honouring
their
father
and
their
mother
they
soon
began
to
be
more
interested
in
the
memory
of
their
departed
parents
than
in
the
happiness
of
their
children
and
their
grandchildren
deliberately
they
turned
their
backs
upon
the
future
and
tried
to
peer
into
the
vast
darkness
of
the
past
the
worship
of
the
ancestors
became
a
positive
religious
system
rather
than
disturb
a
cemetery
situated
upon
the
sunny
and
fertile
side
of
a
mountain
they
would
plant
their
rice
and
wheat
upon
the
barren
rocks
of
the
other
slope
where
nothing
could
possibly
grow
and
they
preferred
hunger
and
famine
to
the
desecration
of
the
ancestral
grave
at
the
same
time
the
wise
words
of
confucius
never
quite
lost
their
hold
upon
the
increasing
millions
of
eastern
asia
confucianism
with
its
profound
sayings
and
shrewd
observations
added
a
touch
of
philosophy
to
the
soul
of
every
chinaman
and
influenced
his
entire
life
whether
he
was
a
simple
laundry
man
in
a
steaming
basement
or
the
ruler
of
vast
provinces
who
dwelt
behind
the
high
walls
of
a
secluded
palace
in
the
sixteenth
century
the
enthusiastic
but
rather
uncivilised
christians
of
the
western
world
came
face
to
face
with
the
older
creeds
of
the
east
the
early
spaniards
and
portuguese
looked
upon
the
peaceful
statues
of
buddha
and
contemplated
the
venerable
pictures
of
confucius
and
did
not
in
the
least
know
what
to
make
of
those
worthy
prophets
with
their
smile
they
came
to
the
easy
conclusion
that
these
strange
divinities
were
just
plain
devils
who
represented
something
idolatrous
and
heretical
and
did
not
deserve
the
respect
of
the
true
sons
of
the
church
whenever
the
spirit
of
buddha
or
confucius
seemed
to
interfere
with
the
trade
in
spices
and
silks
the
europeans
attacked
the
evil
influence
with
bullets
and
that
system
had
certain
very
definite
disadvantages
it
has
left
us
an
unpleasant
heritage
of
which
promises
little
good
for
the
immediate
future
the
reformation
the
progress
of
the
human
race
is
best
compared
to
a
gigantic
pendulum
which
forever
swings
forward
and
backward
the
religious
indifference
and
the
artistic
and
literary
enthusiasm
of
the
renaissance
were
followed
by
the
artistic
and
literary
indifference
and
the
religious
enthusiasm
of
the
reformation
of
course
you
have
heard
of
the
reformation
you
think
of
a
small
but
courageous
group
of
pilgrims
who
crossed
the
ocean
to
have
freedom
of
religious
worship
vaguely
in
the
course
of
time
and
more
especially
in
our
protestant
countries
the
reformation
has
come
to
stand
for
the
idea
of
liberty
of
thought
martin
luther
is
represented
as
the
leader
of
the
vanguard
of
progress
but
when
history
is
something
more
than
a
series
of
flattering
speeches
addressed
to
our
own
glorious
ancestors
when
to
use
the
words
of
the
german
historian
ranke
we
try
to
discover
what
actually
happened
then
much
of
the
past
is
seen
in
a
very
different
light
few
things
in
human
life
are
either
entirely
good
or
entirely
bad
few
things
are
either
black
or
white
it
is
the
duty
of
the
honest
chronicler
to
give
a
true
account
of
all
the
good
and
bad
sides
of
every
historical
event
it
is
very
difficult
to
do
this
because
we
all
have
our
personal
likes
and
dislikes
but
we
ought
to
try
and
be
as
fair
as
we
can
be
and
must
not
allow
our
prejudices
to
influence
us
too
much
take
my
own
case
as
an
example
i
grew
up
in
the
very
protestant
centre
of
a
very
protestant
country
i
never
saw
any
catholics
until
i
was
about
twelve
years
old
then
i
felt
very
uncomfortable
when
i
met
them
i
was
a
little
bit
afraid
i
knew
the
story
of
the
many
thousand
people
who
had
been
burned
and
hanged
and
quartered
by
the
spanish
inquisition
when
the
duke
of
alba
tried
to
cure
the
dutch
people
of
their
lutheran
and
calvinistic
heresies
all
that
was
very
real
to
me
it
seemed
to
have
happened
only
the
day
before
it
might
occur
again
there
might
be
another
saint
bartholomew
night
and
poor
little
me
would
be
slaughtered
in
my
nightie
and
my
body
would
be
thrown
out
of
the
window
as
had
happened
to
the
noble
admiral
de
coligny
much
later
i
went
to
live
for
a
number
of
years
in
a
catholic
country
i
found
the
people
much
pleasanter
and
much
more
tolerant
and
quite
as
intelligent
as
my
former
countrymen
to
my
great
surprise
i
began
to
discover
that
there
was
a
catholic
side
to
the
reformation
quite
as
much
as
a
protestant
of
course
the
good
people
of
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
who
actually
lived
through
the
reformation
did
not
see
things
that
way
they
were
always
right
and
their
enemy
was
always
wrong
it
was
a
question
of
hang
or
be
hanged
and
both
sides
preferred
to
do
the
hanging
which
was
no
more
than
human
and
for
which
they
deserve
no
blame
when
we
look
at
the
world
as
it
appeared
in
the
year
an
easy
date
to
remember
and
the
year
in
which
the
emperor
charles
v
was
born
this
is
what
we
see
the
feudal
disorder
of
the
middle
ages
has
given
way
before
the
order
of
a
number
of
highly
centralised
kingdoms
the
most
powerful
of
all
sovereigns
is
the
great
charles
then
a
baby
in
a
cradle
he
is
the
grandson
of
ferdinand
and
isabella
and
of
maximilian
of
habsburg
the
last
of
the
mediaeval
knights
and
of
his
wife
mary
the
daughter
of
charles
the
bold
the
ambitious
burgundian
duke
who
had
made
successful
war
upon
france
but
had
been
killed
by
the
independent
swiss
peasants
the
child
charles
therefore
has
fallen
heir
to
the
greater
part
of
the
map
to
all
the
lands
of
his
parents
grandparents
uncles
cousins
and
aunts
in
germany
in
austria
in
holland
in
belgium
in
italy
and
in
spain
together
with
all
their
colonies
in
asia
africa
and
america
by
a
strange
irony
of
fate
he
has
been
born
in
ghent
in
that
same
castle
of
the
counts
of
flanders
which
the
germans
used
as
a
prison
during
their
recent
occupation
of
belgium
and
although
a
spanish
king
and
a
german
emperor
he
receives
the
training
of
a
fleming
as
his
father
is
dead
poisoned
so
people
say
but
this
is
never
proved
and
his
mother
has
lost
her
mind
she
is
travelling
through
her
domains
with
the
coffin
containing
the
body
of
her
departed
husband
the
child
is
left
to
the
strict
discipline
of
his
aunt
margaret
forced
to
rule
germans
and
italians
and
spaniards
and
a
hundred
strange
races
charles
grows
up
a
fleming
a
faithful
son
of
the
catholic
church
but
quite
averse
to
religious
intolerance
he
is
rather
lazy
both
as
a
boy
and
as
a
man
but
fate
condemns
him
to
rule
the
world
when
the
world
is
in
a
turmoil
of
religious
fervour
forever
he
is
speeding
from
madrid
to
innsbruck
and
from
bruges
to
vienna
he
loves
peace
and
quiet
and
he
is
always
at
war
at
the
age
of
we
see
him
turn
his
back
upon
the
human
race
in
utter
disgust
at
so
much
hate
and
so
much
stupidity
three
years
later
he
dies
a
very
tired
and
disappointed
man
so
much
for
charles
the
emperor
how
about
the
church
the
second
great
power
in
the
world
the
church
has
changed
greatly
since
the
early
days
of
the
middle
ages
when
it
started
out
to
conquer
the
heathen
and
show
them
the
advantages
of
a
pious
and
righteous
life
in
the
first
place
the
church
has
grown
too
rich
the
pope
is
no
longer
the
shepherd
of
a
flock
of
humble
christians
he
lives
in
a
vast
palace
and
surrounds
himself
with
artists
and
musicians
and
famous
literary
men
his
churches
and
chapels
are
covered
with
new
pictures
in
which
the
saints
look
more
like
greek
gods
than
is
strictly
necessary
he
divides
his
time
unevenly
between
affairs
of
state
and
art
the
affairs
of
state
take
ten
percent
of
his
time
the
other
ninety
percent
goes
to
an
active
interest
in
roman
statues
recently
discovered
greek
vases
plans
for
a
new
summer
home
the
rehearsal
of
a
new
play
the
archbishops
and
the
cardinals
follow
the
example
of
their
pope
the
bishops
try
to
imitate
the
archbishops
the
village
priests
however
have
remained
faithful
to
their
duties
they
keep
themselves
aloof
from
the
wicked
world
and
the
heathenish
love
of
beauty
and
pleasure
they
stay
away
from
the
monasteries
where
the
monks
seem
to
have
forgotten
their
ancient
vows
of
simplicity
and
poverty
and
live
as
happily
as
they
dare
without
causing
too
much
of
a
public
scandal
finally
there
are
the
common
people
they
are
much
better
off
than
they
have
ever
been
before
they
are
more
prosperous
they
live
in
better
houses
their
children
go
to
better
schools
their
cities
are
more
beautiful
than
before
their
firearms
have
made
them
the
equal
of
their
old
enemies
the
who
for
centuries
have
levied
such
heavy
taxes
upon
their
trade
so
much
for
the
chief
actors
in
the
reformation
now
let
us
see
what
the
renaissance
has
done
to
europe
and
then
you
will
understand
how
the
revival
of
learning
and
art
was
bound
to
be
followed
by
a
revival
of
religious
interests
the
renaissance
began
in
italy
from
there
it
spread
to
france
it
was
not
quite
successful
in
spain
where
five
hundred
years
of
warfare
with
the
moors
had
made
the
people
very
narrow
minded
and
very
fanatical
in
all
religious
matters
the
circle
had
grown
wider
and
wider
but
once
the
alps
had
been
crossed
the
renaissance
had
suffered
a
change
the
people
of
northern
europe
living
in
a
very
different
climate
had
an
outlook
upon
life
which
contrasted
strangely
with
that
of
their
southern
neighbours
the
italians
lived
out
in
the
open
under
a
sunny
sky
it
was
easy
for
them
to
laugh
and
to
sing
and
to
be
happy
the
germans
the
dutch
the
english
the
swedes
spent
most
of
their
time
indoors
listening
to
the
rain
beating
on
the
closed
windows
of
their
comfortable
little
houses
they
did
not
laugh
quite
so
much
they
took
everything
more
seriously
they
were
forever
conscious
of
their
immortal
souls
and
they
did
not
like
to
be
funny
about
matters
which
they
considered
holy
and
sacred
the
humanistic
part
of
the
renaissance
the
books
the
studies
of
ancient
authors
the
grammar
and
the
interested
them
greatly
but
the
general
return
to
the
old
pagan
civilisation
of
greece
and
rome
which
was
one
of
the
chief
results
of
the
renaissance
in
italy
filled
their
hearts
with
horror
but
the
papacy
and
the
college
of
cardinals
was
almost
entirely
composed
of
italians
and
they
had
turned
the
church
into
a
pleasant
club
where
people
discussed
art
and
music
and
the
theatre
but
rarely
mentioned
religion
hence
the
split
between
the
serious
north
and
the
more
civilised
but
and
indifferent
south
was
growing
wider
and
wider
all
the
time
and
nobody
seemed
to
be
aware
of
the
danger
that
threatened
the
church
there
were
a
few
minor
reasons
which
will
explain
why
the
reformation
took
place
in
germany
rather
than
in
sweden
or
england
the
germans
bore
an
ancient
grudge
against
rome
the
endless
quarrels
between
emperor
and
pope
had
caused
much
mutual
bitterness
in
the
other
european
countries
where
the
government
rested
in
the
hands
of
a
strong
king
the
ruler
had
often
been
able
to
protect
his
subjects
against
the
greed
of
the
priests
in
germany
where
a
shadowy
emperor
ruled
a
turbulent
crowd
of
little
princelings
the
good
burghers
were
more
directly
at
the
mercy
of
their
bishops
and
prelates
these
dignitaries
were
trying
to
collect
large
sums
of
money
for
the
benefit
of
those
enormous
churches
which
were
a
hobby
of
the
popes
of
the
renaissance
the
germans
felt
that
they
were
being
mulcted
and
quite
naturally
they
did
not
like
it
and
then
there
is
the
rarely
mentioned
fact
that
germany
was
the
home
of
the
printing
press
in
northern
europe
books
were
cheap
and
the
bible
was
no
longer
a
mysterious
owned
and
explained
by
the
priest
it
was
a
household
book
of
many
families
where
latin
was
understood
by
the
father
and
by
the
children
whole
families
began
to
read
it
which
was
against
the
law
of
the
church
they
discovered
that
the
priests
were
telling
them
many
things
which
according
to
the
original
text
of
the
holy
scriptures
were
somewhat
different
this
caused
doubt
people
began
to
ask
questions
and
questions
when
they
can
not
be
answered
often
cause
a
great
deal
of
trouble
the
attack
began
when
the
humanists
of
the
north
opened
fire
upon
the
monks
in
their
heart
of
hearts
they
still
had
too
much
respect
and
reverence
for
the
pope
to
direct
their
sallies
against
his
most
holy
person
but
the
lazy
ignorant
monks
living
behind
the
sheltering
walls
of
their
rich
monasteries
offered
rare
sport
the
leader
in
this
warfare
curiously
enough
was
a
very
faithful
son
of
the
church
gerard
gerardzoon
or
desiderius
erasmus
as
he
is
usually
called
was
a
poor
boy
born
in
rotterdam
in
holland
and
educated
at
the
same
latin
school
of
deventer
from
which
thomas
a
kempis
had
graduated
he
had
become
a
priest
and
for
a
time
he
had
lived
in
a
monastery
he
had
travelled
a
great
deal
and
knew
whereof
he
wrote
when
he
began
his
career
as
a
public
pamphleteer
he
would
have
been
called
an
editorial
writer
in
our
day
the
world
was
greatly
amused
at
an
anonymous
series
of
letters
which
had
just
appeared
under
the
title
of
letters
of
obscure
men
in
these
letters
the
general
stupidity
and
arrogance
of
the
monks
of
the
late
middle
ages
was
exposed
in
a
strange
doggerel
which
reminds
one
of
our
modern
limericks
erasmus
himself
was
a
very
learned
and
serious
scholar
who
knew
both
latin
and
greek
and
gave
us
the
first
reliable
version
of
the
new
testament
which
he
translated
into
latin
together
with
a
corrected
edition
of
the
original
greek
text
but
he
believed
with
sallust
the
roman
poet
that
nothing
prevents
us
from
stating
the
truth
with
a
smile
upon
our
lips
in
the
year
while
visiting
sir
thomas
more
in
he
took
a
few
weeks
off
and
wrote
a
funny
little
book
called
the
praise
of
folly
in
which
he
attacked
the
monks
and
their
credulous
followers
with
that
most
dangerous
of
all
weapons
humor
the
booklet
was
the
best
seller
of
the
sixteenth
century
it
was
translated
into
almost
every
language
and
it
made
people
pay
attention
to
those
other
books
of
erasmus
in
which
he
advocated
reform
of
the
many
abuses
of
the
church
and
appealed
to
his
fellow
humanists
to
help
him
in
his
task
of
bringing
about
a
great
rebirth
of
the
christian
faith
but
nothing
came
of
these
excellent
plans
erasmus
was
too
reasonable
and
too
tolerant
to
please
most
of
the
enemies
of
the
church
they
were
waiting
for
a
leader
of
a
more
robust
nature
he
came
and
his
name
was
martin
luther
luther
was
a
peasant
with
a
brain
and
possessed
of
great
personal
courage
he
was
a
university
man
a
master
of
arts
of
the
university
of
erfurt
afterwards
he
joined
a
dominican
monastery
then
he
became
a
college
professor
at
the
theological
school
of
wittenberg
and
began
to
explain
the
scriptures
to
the
indifferent
ploughboys
of
his
saxon
home
he
had
a
lot
of
spare
time
and
this
he
used
to
study
the
original
texts
of
the
old
and
new
testaments
soon
he
began
to
see
the
great
difference
which
existed
between
the
words
of
christ
and
those
that
were
preached
by
the
popes
and
the
bishops
in
the
year
he
visited
rome
on
official
business
alexander
vi
of
the
family
of
borgia
who
had
enriched
himself
for
the
benefit
of
his
son
and
daughter
was
dead
but
his
successor
julius
ii
a
man
of
irreproachable
personal
character
was
spending
most
of
his
time
fighting
and
building
and
did
not
impress
this
serious
minded
german
theologian
with
his
piety
luther
returned
to
wittenberg
a
much
disappointed
man
but
worse
was
to
follow
the
gigantic
church
of
peter
which
pope
julius
had
wished
upon
his
innocent
successors
although
only
half
begun
was
already
in
need
of
repair
alexander
vi
had
spent
every
penny
of
the
papal
treasury
leo
x
who
succeeded
julius
in
the
year
was
on
the
verge
of
bankruptcy
he
reverted
to
an
old
method
of
raising
ready
cash
he
began
to
sell
indulgences
an
indulgence
was
a
piece
of
parchment
which
in
return
for
a
certain
sum
of
money
promised
a
sinner
a
decrease
of
the
time
which
he
would
have
to
spend
in
purgatory
it
was
a
perfectly
correct
thing
according
to
the
creed
of
the
late
middle
ages
since
the
church
had
the
power
to
forgive
the
sins
of
those
who
truly
repented
before
they
died
the
church
also
had
the
right
to
shorten
through
its
intercession
with
the
saints
the
time
during
which
the
soul
must
be
purified
in
the
shadowy
realms
of
purgatory
it
was
unfortunate
that
these
indulgences
must
be
sold
for
money
but
they
offered
an
easy
form
of
revenue
and
besides
those
who
were
too
poor
to
pay
received
theirs
for
nothing
now
it
happened
in
the
year
that
the
exclusive
territory
for
the
sale
of
indulgences
in
saxony
was
given
to
a
dominican
monk
by
the
name
of
johan
tetzel
brother
johan
was
a
hustling
salesman
to
tell
the
truth
he
was
a
little
too
eager
his
business
methods
outraged
the
pious
people
of
the
little
duchy
and
luther
who
was
an
honest
fellow
got
so
angry
that
he
did
a
rash
thing
on
the
of
october
of
the
year
he
went
to
the
court
church
and
upon
the
doors
thereof
he
posted
a
sheet
of
paper
with
statements
or
theses
attacking
the
sale
of
indulgences
these
statements
had
been
written
in
latin
luther
had
no
intention
of
starting
a
riot
he
was
not
a
revolutionist
he
objected
to
the
institution
of
the
indulgences
and
he
wanted
his
fellow
professors
to
know
what
he
thought
about
them
but
this
was
still
a
private
affair
of
the
clerical
and
professorial
world
and
there
was
no
appeal
to
the
prejudices
of
the
community
of
laymen
unfortunately
at
that
moment
when
the
whole
world
had
begun
to
take
an
interest
in
the
religious
affairs
of
the
day
it
was
utterly
impossible
to
discuss
anything
without
at
once
creating
a
serious
mental
disturbance
in
less
than
two
months
all
europe
was
discussing
the
theses
of
the
saxon
monk
every
one
must
take
sides
every
obscure
little
theologian
must
print
his
own
opinion
the
papal
authorities
began
to
be
alarmed
they
ordered
the
wittenberg
professor
to
proceed
to
rome
and
give
an
account
of
his
action
luther
wisely
remembered
what
had
happened
to
huss
he
stayed
in
germany
and
he
was
punished
with
excommunication
luther
burned
the
papal
bull
in
the
presence
of
an
admiring
multitude
and
from
that
moment
peace
between
himself
and
the
pope
was
no
longer
possible
without
any
desire
on
his
part
luther
had
become
the
leader
of
a
vast
army
of
discontented
christians
german
patriots
like
ulrich
von
hutten
rushed
to
his
defence
the
students
of
wittenberg
and
erfurt
and
leipzig
offered
to
defend
him
should
the
authorities
try
to
imprison
him
the
elector
of
saxony
reassured
the
eager
young
men
no
harm
would
befall
luther
as
long
as
he
stayed
on
saxon
ground
all
this
happened
in
the
year
charles
v
was
twenty
years
old
and
as
the
ruler
of
half
the
world
was
forced
to
remain
on
pleasant
terms
with
the
pope
he
sent
out
calls
for
a
diet
or
general
assembly
in
the
good
city
of
worms
on
the
rhine
and
commanded
luther
to
be
present
and
give
an
account
of
his
extraordinary
behaviour
luther
who
now
was
the
national
hero
of
the
germans
went
he
refused
to
take
back
a
single
word
of
what
he
had
ever
written
or
said
his
conscience
was
controlled
only
by
the
word
of
god
he
would
live
and
die
for
his
conscience
the
diet
of
worms
after
due
deliberation
declared
luther
an
outlaw
before
god
and
man
and
forbade
all
germans
to
give
him
shelter
or
food
or
drink
or
to
read
a
single
word
of
the
books
which
the
dastardly
heretic
had
written
but
the
great
reformer
was
in
no
danger
by
the
majority
of
the
germans
of
the
north
the
edict
was
denounced
as
a
most
unjust
and
outrageous
document
for
greater
safety
luther
was
hidden
in
the
wartburg
a
castle
belonging
to
the
elector
of
saxony
and
there
he
defied
all
papal
authority
by
translating
the
entire
bible
into
the
german
language
that
all
the
people
might
read
and
know
the
word
of
god
for
themselves
by
this
time
the
reformation
was
no
longer
a
spiritual
and
religious
affair
those
who
hated
the
beauty
of
the
modern
church
building
used
this
period
of
unrest
to
attack
and
destroy
what
they
did
not
like
because
they
did
not
understand
it
impoverished
knights
tried
to
make
up
for
past
losses
by
grabbing
the
territory
which
belonged
to
the
monasteries
discontented
princes
made
use
of
the
absence
of
the
emperor
to
increase
their
own
power
the
starving
peasants
following
the
leadership
of
agitators
made
the
best
of
the
opportunity
and
attacked
the
castles
of
their
masters
and
plundered
and
murdered
and
burned
with
the
zeal
of
the
old
crusaders
a
veritable
reign
of
disorder
broke
loose
throughout
the
empire
some
princes
became
protestants
as
the
protesting
adherents
of
luther
were
called
and
persecuted
their
catholic
subjects
others
remained
catholic
and
hanged
their
protestant
subjects
the
diet
of
speyer
of
the
year
tried
to
settle
this
difficult
question
of
allegiance
by
ordering
that
the
subjects
should
all
be
of
the
same
religious
denomination
as
their
princes
this
turned
germany
into
a
checkerboard
of
a
thousand
hostile
little
duchies
and
principalities
and
created
a
situation
which
prevented
the
normal
political
growth
for
hundreds
of
years
in
february
of
the
year
luther
died
and
was
put
to
rest
in
the
same
church
where
years
before
he
had
proclaimed
his
famous
objections
to
the
sale
of
indulgences
in
less
than
thirty
years
the
indifferent
joking
and
laughing
world
of
the
renaissance
had
been
transformed
into
the
arguing
quarrelling
of
the
reformation
the
universal
spiritual
empire
of
the
popes
came
to
a
sudden
end
and
the
whole
western
europe
was
turned
into
a
where
protestants
and
catholics
killed
each
other
for
the
greater
glory
of
certain
theological
doctrines
which
are
as
incomprehensible
to
the
present
generation
as
the
mysterious
inscriptions
of
the
ancient
etruscans
religious
warfare
the
age
of
the
great
religious
controversies
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
were
the
age
of
religious
controversy
if
you
will
notice
you
will
find
that
almost
everybody
around
you
is
forever
talking
economics
and
discussing
wages
and
hours
of
labor
and
strikes
in
their
relation
to
the
life
of
the
community
for
that
is
the
main
topic
of
interest
of
our
own
time
the
poor
little
children
of
the
year
or
fared
worse
they
never
heard
anything
but
religion
their
heads
were
filled
with
predestination
transubstantition
free
will
and
a
hundred
other
queer
words
expressing
obscure
points
of
the
true
faith
whether
catholic
or
protestant
according
to
the
desire
of
their
parents
they
were
baptised
catholics
or
lutherans
or
calvinists
or
zwinglians
or
anabaptists
they
learned
their
theology
from
the
augsburg
catechism
composed
by
luther
or
from
the
institutes
of
christianity
written
by
calvin
or
they
mumbled
the
articles
of
faith
which
were
printed
in
the
english
book
of
common
prayer
and
they
were
told
that
these
alone
represented
the
true
faith
they
heard
of
the
wholesale
theft
of
church
property
perpetrated
by
king
henry
viii
the
monarch
of
england
who
made
himself
the
supreme
head
of
the
english
church
and
assumed
the
old
papal
rights
of
appointing
bishops
and
priests
they
had
a
nightmare
whenever
some
one
mentioned
the
holy
inquisition
with
its
dungeons
and
its
many
torture
chambers
and
they
were
treated
to
equally
horrible
stories
of
how
a
mob
of
outraged
dutch
protestants
had
got
hold
of
a
dozen
defenceless
old
priests
and
hanged
them
for
the
sheer
pleasure
of
killing
those
who
professed
a
different
faith
it
was
unfortunate
that
the
two
contending
parties
were
so
equally
matched
otherwise
the
struggle
would
have
come
to
a
quick
solution
now
it
dragged
on
for
eight
generations
and
it
grew
so
complicated
that
i
can
only
tell
you
the
most
important
details
and
must
ask
you
to
get
the
rest
from
one
of
the
many
histories
of
the
reformation
the
great
reform
movement
of
the
protestants
had
been
followed
by
a
thoroughgoing
reform
within
the
bosom
of
the
church
those
popes
who
had
been
merely
amateur
humanists
and
dealers
in
roman
and
greek
antiquities
disappeared
from
the
scene
and
their
place
was
taken
by
serious
men
who
spent
twenty
hours
a
day
administering
those
holy
duties
which
had
been
placed
in
their
hands
the
long
and
rather
disgraceful
happiness
of
the
monasteries
came
to
an
end
monks
and
nuns
were
forced
to
be
up
at
sunrise
to
study
the
church
fathers
to
tend
the
sick
and
console
the
dying
the
holy
inquisition
watched
day
and
night
that
no
dangerous
doctrines
should
be
spread
by
way
of
the
printing
press
here
it
is
customary
to
mention
poor
galileo
who
was
locked
up
because
he
had
been
a
little
too
indiscreet
in
explaining
the
heavens
with
his
funny
little
telescope
and
had
muttered
certain
opinions
about
the
behaviour
of
the
planets
which
were
entirely
opposed
to
the
official
views
of
the
church
but
in
all
fairness
to
the
pope
the
clergy
and
the
inquisition
it
ought
to
be
stated
that
the
protestants
were
quite
as
much
the
enemies
of
science
and
medicine
as
the
catholics
and
with
equal
manifestations
of
ignorance
and
intolerance
regarded
the
men
who
investigated
things
for
themselves
as
the
most
dangerous
enemies
of
mankind
and
calvin
the
great
french
reformer
and
the
tyrant
both
political
and
spiritual
of
geneva
not
only
assisted
the
french
authorities
when
they
tried
to
hang
michael
servetus
the
spanish
theologian
and
physician
who
had
become
famous
as
the
assistant
of
vesalius
the
first
great
anatomist
but
when
servetus
had
managed
to
escape
from
his
french
jail
and
had
fled
to
geneva
calvin
threw
this
brilliant
man
into
prison
and
after
a
prolonged
trial
allowed
him
to
be
burned
at
the
stake
on
account
of
his
heresies
totally
indifferent
to
his
fame
as
a
scientist
and
so
it
went
we
have
few
reliable
statistics
upon
the
subject
but
on
the
whole
the
protestants
tired
of
this
game
long
before
the
catholics
and
the
greater
part
of
honest
men
and
women
who
were
burned
and
hanged
and
decapitated
on
account
of
their
religious
beliefs
fell
as
victims
of
the
very
energetic
but
also
very
drastic
church
of
rome
for
tolerance
and
please
remember
this
when
you
grow
older
is
of
very
recent
origin
and
even
the
people
of
our
own
modern
world
are
apt
to
be
tolerant
only
upon
such
matters
as
do
not
interest
them
very
much
they
are
tolerant
towards
a
native
of
africa
and
do
not
care
whether
he
becomes
a
buddhist
or
a
mohammedan
because
neither
buddhism
nor
mohammedanism
means
anything
to
them
but
when
they
hear
that
their
neighbour
who
was
a
republican
and
believed
in
a
high
protective
tariff
has
joined
the
socialist
party
and
now
wants
to
repeal
all
tariff
laws
their
tolerance
ceases
and
they
use
almost
the
same
words
as
those
employed
by
a
kindly
catholic
or
protestant
of
the
seventeenth
century
who
was
informed
that
his
best
friend
whom
he
had
always
respected
and
loved
had
fallen
a
victim
to
the
terrible
heresies
of
the
protestant
or
catholic
church
heresy
until
a
very
short
time
ago
was
regarded
as
a
disease
nowadays
when
we
see
a
man
neglecting
the
personal
cleanliness
of
his
body
and
his
home
and
exposing
himself
and
his
children
to
the
dangers
of
typhoid
fever
or
another
preventable
disease
we
send
for
the
and
the
health
officer
calls
upon
the
police
to
aid
him
in
removing
this
person
who
is
a
danger
to
the
safety
of
the
entire
community
in
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
a
heretic
a
man
or
a
woman
who
openly
doubted
the
fundamental
principles
upon
which
his
protestant
or
catholic
religion
had
been
founded
was
considered
a
more
terrible
menace
than
a
typhoid
carrier
typhoid
fever
might
very
likely
would
destroy
the
body
but
heresy
according
to
them
would
positively
destroy
the
immortal
soul
it
was
therefore
the
duty
of
all
good
and
logical
citizens
to
warn
the
police
against
the
enemies
of
the
established
order
of
things
and
those
who
failed
to
do
so
were
as
culpable
as
a
modern
man
who
does
not
telephone
to
the
nearest
doctor
when
he
discovers
that
his
are
suffering
from
cholera
or
in
the
years
to
come
you
will
hear
a
great
deal
about
preventive
medicine
preventive
medicine
simply
means
that
our
doctors
do
not
wait
until
their
patients
are
sick
then
step
forward
and
cure
them
on
the
contrary
they
study
the
patient
and
the
conditions
under
which
he
lives
when
he
the
patient
is
perfectly
well
and
they
remove
every
possible
cause
of
illness
by
cleaning
up
rubbish
by
teaching
him
what
to
eat
and
what
to
avoid
and
by
giving
him
a
few
simple
ideas
of
personal
hygiene
they
go
even
further
than
that
and
these
good
doctors
enter
the
schools
and
teach
the
children
how
to
use
and
how
to
avoid
catching
colds
the
sixteenth
century
which
regarded
as
i
have
tried
to
show
you
bodily
illness
as
much
less
important
than
sickness
which
threatened
the
soul
organised
a
system
of
spiritual
preventive
medicine
as
soon
as
a
child
was
old
enough
to
spell
his
first
words
he
was
educated
in
the
true
and
the
only
true
principles
of
the
faith
indirectly
this
proved
to
be
a
good
thing
for
the
general
progress
of
the
people
of
europe
the
protestant
lands
were
soon
dotted
with
schools
they
used
a
great
deal
of
very
valuable
time
to
explain
the
catechism
but
they
gave
instruction
in
other
things
besides
theology
they
encouraged
reading
and
they
were
responsible
for
the
great
prosperity
of
the
printing
trade
but
the
catholics
did
not
lag
behind
they
too
devoted
much
time
and
thought
to
education
the
church
in
this
matter
found
an
invaluable
friend
and
ally
in
the
order
of
the
society
of
jesus
the
founder
of
this
remarkable
organisation
was
a
spanish
soldier
who
after
a
life
of
unholy
adventures
had
been
converted
and
thereupon
felt
himself
bound
to
serve
the
church
just
as
many
former
sinners
who
have
been
shown
the
errors
of
their
way
by
the
salvation
army
devote
the
remaining
years
of
their
lives
to
the
task
of
aiding
and
consoling
those
who
are
less
fortunate
the
name
of
this
spaniard
was
ignatius
de
loyola
he
was
born
in
the
year
before
the
discovery
of
america
he
had
been
wounded
and
lamed
for
life
and
while
he
was
in
the
hospital
he
had
seen
a
vision
of
the
holy
virgin
and
her
son
who
bade
him
give
up
the
wickedness
of
his
former
life
he
decided
to
go
to
the
holy
land
and
finish
the
task
of
the
crusades
but
a
visit
to
jerusalem
had
shown
him
the
impossibility
of
the
task
and
he
returned
west
to
help
in
the
warfare
upon
the
heresies
of
the
lutherans
in
the
year
he
was
studying
in
paris
at
the
sorbonne
together
with
seven
other
students
he
founded
a
fraternity
the
eight
men
promised
each
other
that
they
would
lead
holy
lives
that
they
would
not
strive
after
riches
but
after
righteousness
and
would
devote
themselves
body
and
soul
to
the
service
of
the
church
a
few
years
later
this
small
fraternity
had
grown
into
a
regular
organisation
and
was
recognised
by
pope
paul
iii
as
the
society
of
jesus
loyola
had
been
a
military
man
he
believed
in
discipline
and
absolute
obedience
to
the
orders
of
the
superior
dignitaries
became
one
of
the
main
causes
for
the
enormous
success
of
the
jesuits
they
specialised
in
education
they
gave
their
teachers
a
most
education
before
they
allowed
them
to
talk
to
a
single
pupil
they
lived
with
their
students
and
they
entered
into
their
games
they
watched
them
with
tender
care
and
as
a
result
they
raised
a
new
generation
of
faithful
catholics
who
took
their
religious
duties
as
seriously
as
the
people
of
the
early
middle
ages
the
shrewd
jesuits
however
did
not
waste
all
their
efforts
upon
the
education
of
the
poor
they
entered
the
palaces
of
the
mighty
and
became
the
private
tutors
of
future
emperors
and
kings
and
what
this
meant
you
will
see
for
yourself
when
i
tell
you
about
the
thirty
years
war
but
before
this
terrible
and
final
outbreak
of
religious
fanaticism
a
great
many
other
things
had
happened
charles
v
was
dead
germany
and
austria
had
been
left
to
his
brother
ferdinand
all
his
other
possessions
spain
and
the
netherlands
and
the
indies
and
america
had
gone
to
his
son
philip
philip
was
the
son
of
charles
and
a
portuguese
princess
who
had
been
first
cousin
to
her
own
husband
the
children
that
are
born
of
such
a
union
are
apt
to
be
rather
queer
the
son
of
philip
the
unfortunate
don
carlos
murdered
afterwards
with
his
own
father
consent
was
crazy
philip
was
not
quite
crazy
but
his
zeal
for
the
church
bordered
closely
upon
religious
insanity
he
believed
that
heaven
had
appointed
him
as
one
of
the
saviours
of
mankind
therefore
whosoever
was
obstinate
and
refused
to
share
his
majesty
views
proclaimed
himself
an
enemy
of
the
human
race
and
must
be
exterminated
lest
his
example
corrupt
the
souls
of
his
pious
neighbours
spain
of
course
was
a
very
rich
country
all
the
gold
and
silver
of
the
new
world
flowed
into
the
castilian
and
aragonian
treasuries
but
spain
suffered
from
a
curious
economic
disease
her
peasants
were
hard
working
men
and
even
harder
working
women
but
the
better
classes
maintained
a
supreme
contempt
for
any
form
of
labour
outside
of
employment
in
the
army
or
navy
or
the
civil
service
as
for
the
moors
who
had
been
very
industrious
artisans
they
had
been
driven
out
of
the
country
long
before
as
a
result
spain
the
treasure
chest
of
the
world
remained
a
poor
country
because
all
her
money
had
to
be
sent
abroad
in
exchange
for
the
wheat
and
the
other
necessities
of
life
which
the
spaniards
neglected
to
raise
for
themselves
philip
ruler
of
the
most
powerful
nation
of
the
sixteenth
century
depended
for
his
revenue
upon
the
taxes
which
were
gathered
in
the
busy
commercial
of
the
netherlands
but
these
flemings
and
dutchmen
were
devoted
followers
of
the
doctrines
of
luther
and
calvin
and
they
had
cleansed
their
churches
of
all
images
and
holy
paintings
and
they
had
informed
the
pope
that
they
no
longer
regarded
him
as
their
shepherd
but
intended
to
follow
the
dictates
of
their
consciences
and
the
commands
of
their
newly
translated
bible
this
placed
the
king
in
a
very
difficult
position
he
could
not
possibly
tolerate
the
heresies
of
his
dutch
subjects
but
he
needed
their
money
if
he
allowed
them
to
be
protestants
and
took
no
measures
to
save
their
souls
he
was
deficient
in
his
duty
toward
god
if
he
sent
the
inquisition
to
the
netherlands
and
burned
his
subjects
at
the
stake
he
would
lose
the
greater
part
of
his
income
being
a
man
of
uncertain
he
hesitated
a
long
time
he
tried
kindness
and
sternness
and
promises
and
threats
the
hollanders
remained
obstinate
and
continued
to
sing
psalms
and
listen
to
the
sermons
of
their
lutheran
and
calvinist
preachers
philip
in
his
despair
sent
his
man
of
iron
the
duke
of
alba
to
bring
these
hardened
sinners
to
terms
alba
began
by
decapitating
those
leaders
who
had
not
wisely
left
the
country
before
his
arrival
in
the
year
the
same
year
that
the
french
protestant
leaders
were
all
killed
during
the
terrible
night
of
saint
bartholomew
he
attacked
a
number
of
dutch
cities
and
massacred
the
inhabitants
as
an
example
for
the
others
the
next
year
he
laid
siege
to
the
town
of
leyden
the
manufacturing
center
of
holland
meanwhile
the
seven
small
provinces
of
the
northern
netherlands
had
formed
a
defensive
union
the
union
of
utrecht
and
had
recognised
william
of
orange
a
german
prince
who
had
been
the
private
secretary
of
the
emperor
charles
v
as
the
leader
of
their
army
and
as
commander
of
their
freebooting
sailors
who
were
known
as
the
beggars
of
the
sea
william
to
save
leyden
cut
the
dykes
created
a
shallow
inland
sea
and
delivered
the
town
with
the
help
of
a
strangely
equipped
navy
consisting
of
scows
and
barges
which
were
rowed
and
pushed
and
pulled
through
the
mud
until
they
reached
the
city
walls
it
was
the
first
time
that
an
army
of
the
invincible
spanish
king
had
suffered
such
a
humiliating
defeat
it
surprised
the
world
just
as
the
japanese
victory
of
mukden
in
the
war
surprised
our
own
generation
the
protestant
powers
took
fresh
courage
and
philip
devised
new
means
for
the
purpose
of
conquering
his
rebellious
subjects
he
hired
a
poor
fanatic
to
go
and
murder
william
of
orange
but
the
sight
of
their
dead
leader
did
not
bring
the
seven
provinces
to
their
knees
on
the
contrary
it
made
them
furiously
angry
in
the
year
the
estates
general
the
meeting
of
the
representatives
of
the
seven
provinces
came
together
at
the
hague
and
most
solemnly
abjured
their
wicked
king
philip
and
themselves
assumed
the
burden
of
sovereignty
which
thus
far
had
been
invested
in
their
king
by
the
grace
of
god
this
is
a
very
important
event
in
the
history
of
the
great
struggle
for
political
liberty
it
was
a
step
which
reached
much
further
than
the
uprising
of
the
nobles
which
ended
with
the
signing
of
the
magna
carta
these
good
burghers
said
between
a
king
and
his
subjects
there
is
a
silent
understanding
that
both
sides
shall
perform
certain
services
and
shall
recognise
certain
definite
duties
if
either
party
fails
to
live
up
to
this
contract
the
other
has
the
right
to
consider
it
terminated
the
american
subjects
of
king
george
iii
in
the
year
came
to
a
similar
conclusion
but
they
had
three
thousand
miles
of
ocean
between
themselves
and
their
ruler
and
the
estates
general
took
their
decision
which
meant
a
slow
death
in
case
of
defeat
within
hearing
of
the
spanish
guns
and
although
in
constant
fear
of
an
avenging
spanish
fleet
the
stories
about
a
mysterious
spanish
fleet
that
was
to
conquer
both
holland
and
england
when
protestant
queen
elizabeth
had
succeeded
catholic
bloody
mary
was
an
old
one
for
years
the
sailors
of
the
waterfront
had
talked
about
it
in
the
eighties
of
the
sixteenth
century
the
rumour
took
a
definite
shape
according
to
pilots
who
had
been
in
lisbon
all
the
spanish
and
portuguese
wharves
were
building
ships
and
in
the
southern
netherlands
in
belgium
the
duke
of
parma
was
collecting
a
large
expeditionary
force
to
be
carried
from
ostend
to
london
and
amsterdam
as
soon
as
the
fleet
should
arrive
in
the
year
the
great
armada
set
sail
for
the
north
but
the
harbours
of
the
flemish
coast
were
blockaded
by
a
dutch
fleet
and
the
channel
was
guarded
by
the
english
and
the
spaniards
accustomed
to
the
quieter
seas
of
the
south
did
not
know
how
to
navigate
in
this
squally
and
bleak
northern
climate
what
happened
to
the
armada
once
it
was
attacked
by
ships
and
by
storms
i
need
not
tell
you
a
few
ships
by
sailing
around
ireland
escaped
to
tell
the
terrible
story
of
defeat
the
others
perished
and
lie
at
the
bottom
of
the
north
sea
turn
about
is
fair
play
the
british
nod
the
dutch
protestants
now
carried
the
war
into
the
territory
of
the
enemy
before
the
end
of
the
century
houtman
with
the
help
of
a
booklet
written
by
linschoten
a
hollander
who
had
been
in
the
portuguese
service
had
at
last
discovered
the
route
to
the
indies
as
a
result
the
great
dutch
east
india
company
was
founded
and
a
systematic
war
upon
the
portuguese
and
spanish
colonies
in
asia
and
africa
was
begun
in
all
seriousness
it
was
during
this
early
era
of
colonial
conquest
that
a
curious
lawsuit
was
fought
out
in
the
dutch
courts
early
in
the
seventeenth
century
a
dutch
captain
by
the
name
of
van
heemskerk
a
man
who
had
made
himself
famous
as
the
head
of
an
expedition
which
had
tried
to
discover
the
north
eastern
passage
to
the
indies
and
who
had
spent
a
winter
on
the
frozen
shores
of
the
island
of
nova
zembla
had
captured
a
portuguese
ship
in
the
straits
of
malacca
you
will
remember
that
the
pope
had
divided
the
world
into
two
equal
shares
one
of
which
had
been
given
to
the
spaniards
and
the
other
to
the
portuguese
the
portuguese
quite
naturally
regarded
the
water
which
surrounded
their
indian
islands
as
part
of
their
own
property
and
since
for
the
moment
they
were
not
at
war
with
the
united
seven
netherlands
they
claimed
that
the
captain
of
a
private
dutch
trading
company
had
no
right
to
enter
their
private
domain
and
steal
their
ships
and
they
brought
suit
the
directors
of
the
dutch
east
india
company
hired
a
bright
young
lawyer
by
the
name
of
de
groot
or
grotius
to
defend
their
case
he
made
the
astonishing
plea
that
the
ocean
is
free
to
all
comers
once
outside
the
distance
which
a
cannon
ball
fired
from
the
land
can
reach
the
sea
is
or
according
to
grotius
ought
to
be
a
free
and
open
highway
to
all
the
ships
of
all
nations
it
was
the
first
time
that
this
startling
doctrine
had
been
publicly
pronounced
in
a
court
of
law
it
was
opposed
by
all
the
other
seafaring
people
to
counteract
the
effect
of
grotius
famous
plea
for
the
mare
liberum
or
open
sea
john
selden
the
englishman
wrote
his
famous
treatise
upon
the
mare
clausum
or
closed
sea
which
treated
of
the
natural
right
of
a
sovereign
to
regard
the
seas
which
surrounded
his
country
as
belonging
to
his
territory
i
mention
this
here
because
the
question
had
not
yet
been
decided
and
during
the
last
war
caused
all
sorts
of
difficulties
and
complications
to
return
to
the
warfare
between
spaniard
and
hollander
and
englishman
before
twenty
years
were
over
the
most
valuable
colonies
of
the
indies
and
the
cape
of
good
hope
and
ceylon
and
those
along
the
coast
of
china
and
even
japan
were
in
protestant
hands
in
a
west
indian
company
was
founded
which
conquered
brazil
and
in
north
america
built
a
fortress
called
nieuw
amsterdam
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
which
henry
hudson
had
discovered
in
the
year
these
new
colonies
enriched
both
england
and
the
dutch
republic
to
such
an
extent
that
they
could
hire
foreign
soldiers
to
do
their
fighting
on
land
while
they
devoted
themselves
to
commerce
and
trade
to
them
the
protestant
revolt
meant
independence
and
prosperity
but
in
many
other
parts
of
europe
it
meant
a
succession
of
horrors
compared
to
which
the
last
war
was
a
mild
excursion
of
kindly
boys
the
thirty
years
war
which
broke
out
in
the
year
and
which
ended
with
the
famous
treaty
of
westphalia
in
was
the
perfectly
natural
result
of
a
century
of
ever
increasing
religious
hatred
it
was
as
i
have
said
a
terrible
war
everybody
fought
everybody
else
and
the
struggle
ended
only
when
all
parties
had
been
thoroughly
exhausted
and
could
fight
no
longer
in
less
than
a
generation
it
turned
many
parts
of
central
europe
into
a
wilderness
where
the
hungry
peasants
fought
for
the
carcass
of
a
dead
horse
with
the
even
hungrier
wolf
of
all
the
german
towns
and
villages
were
destroyed
the
palatinate
in
western
germany
was
plundered
times
and
a
population
of
eighteen
million
people
was
reduced
to
four
million
the
hostilities
began
almost
as
soon
as
ferdinand
ii
of
the
house
of
habsburg
had
been
elected
emperor
he
was
the
product
of
a
most
careful
jesuit
training
and
was
a
most
obedient
and
devout
son
of
the
church
the
vow
which
he
had
made
as
a
young
man
that
he
would
eradicate
all
sects
and
all
heresies
from
his
domains
ferdinand
kept
to
the
best
of
his
ability
two
days
before
his
election
his
chief
opponent
frederick
the
protestant
elector
of
the
palatinate
and
a
of
james
i
of
england
had
been
made
king
of
bohemia
in
direct
violation
of
ferdinand
wishes
at
once
the
habsburg
armies
marched
into
bohemia
the
young
king
looked
in
vain
for
assistance
against
this
formidable
enemy
the
dutch
republic
was
willing
to
help
but
engaged
in
a
desperate
war
of
its
own
with
the
spanish
branch
of
the
habsburgs
it
could
do
little
the
stuarts
in
england
were
more
interested
in
strengthening
their
own
absolute
power
at
home
than
spending
money
and
men
upon
a
forlorn
adventure
in
far
away
bohemia
after
a
struggle
of
a
few
months
the
elector
of
the
palatinate
was
driven
away
and
his
domains
were
given
to
the
catholic
house
of
bavaria
this
was
the
beginning
of
the
great
war
then
the
habsburg
armies
under
tilly
and
wallenstein
fought
their
way
through
the
protestant
part
of
germany
until
they
had
reached
the
shores
of
the
baltic
a
catholic
neighbour
meant
serious
danger
to
the
protestant
king
of
denmark
christian
iv
tried
to
defend
himself
by
attacking
his
enemies
before
they
had
become
too
strong
for
him
the
danish
armies
marched
into
germany
but
were
defeated
wallenstein
followed
up
his
victory
with
such
energy
and
violence
that
denmark
was
forced
to
sue
for
peace
only
one
town
of
the
baltic
then
remained
in
the
hands
of
the
protestants
that
was
stralsund
there
in
the
early
summer
of
the
year
landed
king
gustavus
adolphus
of
the
house
of
vasa
king
of
sweden
and
famous
as
the
man
who
had
defended
his
country
against
the
russians
a
protestant
prince
of
unlimited
ambition
desirous
of
making
sweden
the
centre
of
a
great
northern
empire
gustavus
adolphus
was
welcomed
by
the
protestant
princes
of
europe
as
the
saviour
of
the
lutheran
cause
he
defeated
tilly
who
had
just
successfully
butchered
the
protestant
inhabitants
of
magdeburg
then
his
troops
began
their
great
march
through
the
heart
of
germany
in
an
attempt
to
reach
the
habsburg
possessions
in
italy
threatened
in
the
rear
by
the
catholics
gustavus
suddenly
veered
around
and
defeated
the
main
habsburg
army
in
the
battle
of
lutzen
unfortunately
the
swedish
king
was
killed
when
he
strayed
away
from
his
troops
but
the
habsburg
power
had
been
broken
ferdinand
who
was
a
suspicious
sort
of
person
at
once
began
to
distrust
his
own
servants
wallenstein
his
was
murdered
at
his
instigation
when
the
catholic
bourbons
who
ruled
france
and
hated
their
habsburg
rivals
heard
of
this
they
joined
the
protestant
swedes
the
armies
of
louis
xiii
invaded
the
eastern
part
of
germany
and
turenne
and
conde
added
their
fame
to
that
of
baner
and
weimar
the
swedish
generals
by
murdering
pillaging
and
burning
habsburg
property
this
brought
great
fame
and
riches
to
the
swedes
and
caused
the
danes
to
become
envious
the
protestant
danes
thereupon
declared
war
upon
the
protestant
swedes
who
were
the
allies
of
the
catholic
french
whose
political
leader
the
cardinal
de
richelieu
had
just
deprived
the
huguenots
or
french
protestants
of
those
rights
of
public
worship
which
the
edict
of
nantes
of
the
year
had
guaranteed
them
the
war
after
the
habit
of
such
encounters
did
not
decide
anything
when
it
came
to
an
end
with
the
treaty
of
westphalia
in
the
catholic
powers
remained
catholic
and
the
protestant
powers
stayed
faithful
to
the
doctrines
of
luther
and
calvin
and
zwingli
the
swiss
and
dutch
protestants
were
recognised
as
independent
republics
france
kept
the
cities
of
metz
and
toul
and
verdun
and
a
part
of
the
alsace
the
holy
roman
empire
continued
to
exist
as
a
sort
of
state
without
men
without
money
without
hope
and
without
courage
the
only
good
the
thirty
years
war
accomplished
was
a
negative
one
it
discouraged
both
catholics
and
protestants
from
ever
trying
it
again
henceforth
they
left
each
other
in
peace
this
however
did
not
mean
that
religious
feeling
and
theological
hatred
had
been
removed
from
this
earth
on
the
contrary
the
quarrels
between
catholic
and
protestant
came
to
an
end
but
the
disputes
between
the
different
protestant
sects
continued
as
bitterly
as
ever
before
in
holland
a
difference
of
opinion
as
to
the
true
nature
of
predestination
a
very
obscure
point
of
theology
but
exceedingly
important
the
eyes
of
your
caused
a
quarrel
which
ended
with
the
decapitation
of
john
of
oldenbarneveldt
the
dutch
statesman
who
had
been
responsible
for
the
success
of
the
republic
during
the
first
twenty
years
of
its
independence
and
who
was
the
great
organising
genius
of
her
indian
trading
company
in
england
the
feud
led
to
civil
war
but
before
i
tell
you
of
this
outbreak
which
led
to
the
first
execution
by
of
a
european
king
i
ought
to
say
something
about
the
previous
history
of
england
in
this
book
i
am
trying
to
give
you
only
those
events
of
the
past
which
can
throw
a
light
upon
the
conditions
of
the
present
world
if
i
do
not
mention
certain
countries
the
cause
is
not
to
be
found
in
any
secret
dislike
on
my
part
i
wish
that
i
could
tell
you
what
happened
to
norway
and
switzerland
and
serbia
and
china
but
these
lands
exercised
no
great
influence
upon
the
development
of
europe
in
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
i
therefore
pass
them
by
with
a
polite
and
very
respectful
bow
england
however
is
in
a
different
position
what
the
people
of
that
small
island
have
done
during
the
last
five
hundred
years
has
shaped
the
course
of
history
in
every
corner
of
the
world
without
a
proper
knowledge
of
the
background
of
english
history
you
can
not
understand
what
you
read
in
the
newspapers
and
it
is
therefore
necessary
that
you
know
how
england
happened
to
develop
a
parliamentary
form
of
government
while
the
rest
of
the
european
continent
was
still
ruled
by
absolute
monarchs
the
english
revolution
how
the
struggle
between
the
divine
right
of
kings
and
the
less
divine
but
more
reasonable
right
of
parliament
ended
disastrously
for
king
charles
ii
caesar
the
earliest
explorer
of
europe
had
crossed
the
channel
in
the
year
and
had
conquered
england
during
four
centuries
the
country
then
remained
a
roman
province
but
when
the
barbarians
began
to
threaten
rome
the
garrisons
were
called
back
from
the
frontier
that
they
might
defend
the
home
country
and
britannia
was
left
without
a
government
and
without
protection
as
soon
as
this
became
known
among
the
hungry
saxon
tribes
of
northern
germany
they
sailed
across
the
north
sea
and
made
themselves
at
home
in
the
prosperous
island
they
founded
a
number
of
independent
kingdoms
so
called
after
the
original
angles
or
english
and
the
saxon
invaders
but
these
small
states
were
for
ever
quarrelling
with
each
other
and
no
king
was
strong
enough
to
establish
himself
as
the
head
of
a
united
country
for
more
than
five
hundred
years
mercia
and
northumbria
and
wessex
and
sussex
and
kent
and
east
anglia
or
whatever
their
names
were
exposed
to
attacks
from
various
scandinavian
pirates
finally
in
the
eleventh
century
england
together
with
norway
and
northern
germany
became
part
of
the
large
danish
empire
of
canute
the
great
and
the
last
vestiges
of
independence
disappeared
the
danes
in
the
course
of
time
were
driven
away
but
no
sooner
was
england
free
than
it
was
conquered
for
the
fourth
time
the
new
enemies
were
the
descendants
of
another
tribe
of
norsemen
who
early
in
the
tenth
century
had
invaded
france
and
had
founded
the
duchy
of
normandy
william
duke
of
normandy
who
for
a
long
time
had
looked
across
the
water
with
an
envious
eye
crossed
the
channel
in
october
of
the
year
at
the
battle
of
hastings
on
october
the
fourteenth
of
that
year
he
destroyed
the
weak
forces
of
harold
of
wessex
the
last
of
the
kings
and
established
himself
as
king
of
england
but
neither
william
nor
his
successors
of
the
house
of
anjou
and
plantagenet
regarded
england
as
their
true
home
to
them
the
island
was
merely
a
part
of
their
great
inheritance
on
the
continent
a
sort
of
colony
inhabited
by
rather
backward
people
upon
whom
they
forced
their
own
language
and
civilisation
gradually
however
the
colony
of
england
gained
upon
the
mother
country
of
normandy
at
the
same
time
the
kings
of
france
were
trying
desperately
to
get
rid
of
the
powerful
neighbours
who
were
in
truth
no
more
than
disobedient
servants
of
the
french
crown
after
a
century
of
war
fare
the
french
people
under
the
leadership
of
a
young
girl
by
the
name
of
joan
of
arc
drove
the
foreigners
from
their
soil
joan
herself
taken
a
prisoner
at
the
battle
of
compiegne
in
the
year
and
sold
by
her
burgundian
captors
to
the
english
soldiers
was
burned
as
a
witch
but
the
english
never
gained
foothold
upon
the
continent
and
their
kings
were
at
last
able
to
devote
all
their
time
to
their
british
possessions
as
the
feudal
nobility
of
the
island
had
been
engaged
in
one
of
those
strange
feuds
which
were
as
common
in
the
middle
ages
as
measles
and
and
as
the
greater
part
of
the
old
landed
proprietors
had
been
killed
during
these
wars
of
the
roses
it
was
quite
easy
for
the
kings
to
increase
their
royal
power
and
by
the
end
of
the
fifteenth
century
england
was
a
strongly
centralised
country
ruled
by
henry
vii
of
the
house
of
tudor
whose
famous
court
of
justice
the
star
chamber
of
terrible
memory
suppressed
all
attempts
on
the
part
of
the
surviving
nobles
to
regain
their
old
influence
upon
the
government
of
the
country
with
the
utmost
severity
in
the
year
henry
vii
was
succeeded
by
his
son
henry
viii
and
from
that
moment
on
the
history
of
england
gained
a
new
importance
for
the
country
ceased
to
be
a
mediaeval
island
and
became
a
modern
state
henry
had
no
deep
interest
in
religion
he
gladly
used
a
private
disagreement
with
the
pope
about
one
of
his
many
divorces
to
declare
himself
independent
of
rome
and
make
the
church
of
england
the
first
of
those
nationalistic
churches
in
which
the
worldly
ruler
also
acts
as
the
spiritual
head
of
his
subjects
this
peaceful
reformation
of
not
only
gave
the
house
of
tudor
the
support
of
the
english
clergy
who
for
a
long
time
had
been
exposed
to
the
violent
attacks
of
many
lutheran
propagandists
but
it
also
increased
the
royal
power
through
the
confiscation
of
the
former
possessions
of
the
monasteries
at
the
same
time
it
made
henry
popular
with
the
merchants
and
tradespeople
who
as
the
proud
and
prosperous
inhabitants
of
an
island
which
was
separated
from
the
rest
of
europe
by
a
wide
and
deep
channel
had
a
great
dislike
for
everything
foreign
and
did
not
want
an
italian
bishop
to
rule
their
honest
british
souls
in
henry
died
he
left
the
throne
to
his
small
son
aged
ten
the
guardians
of
the
child
favoring
the
modern
lutheran
doctrines
did
their
best
to
help
the
cause
of
protestantism
but
the
boy
died
before
he
was
sixteen
and
was
succeeded
by
his
sister
mary
the
wife
of
philip
ii
of
spain
who
burned
the
bishops
of
the
new
national
church
and
in
other
ways
followed
the
example
of
her
royal
spanish
husband
fortunately
she
died
in
the
year
and
was
succeeded
by
elizabeth
the
daughter
of
henry
viii
and
anne
boleyn
the
second
of
his
six
wives
whom
he
had
decapitated
when
she
no
longer
pleased
him
elizabeth
who
had
spent
some
time
in
prison
and
who
had
been
released
only
at
the
request
of
the
holy
roman
emperor
was
a
most
cordial
enemy
of
everything
catholic
and
spanish
she
shared
her
father
indifference
in
the
matter
of
religion
but
she
inherited
his
ability
as
a
very
shrewd
judge
of
character
and
spent
the
years
of
her
reign
in
strengthening
the
power
of
the
dynasty
and
in
increasing
the
revenue
and
possessions
of
her
merry
islands
in
this
she
was
most
ably
assisted
by
a
number
of
men
who
gathered
around
her
throne
and
made
the
elizabethan
age
a
period
of
such
importance
that
you
ought
to
study
it
in
detail
in
one
of
the
special
books
of
which
i
shall
tell
you
in
the
bibliography
at
the
end
of
this
volume
elizabeth
however
did
not
feel
entirely
safe
upon
her
throne
she
had
a
rival
and
a
very
dangerous
one
mary
of
the
house
of
stuart
daughter
of
a
french
duchess
and
a
scottish
father
widow
of
king
francis
ii
of
france
and
of
catherine
of
medici
who
had
organised
the
murders
of
saint
bartholomew
night
was
the
mother
of
a
little
boy
who
was
afterwards
to
become
the
first
stuart
king
of
england
she
was
an
ardent
catholic
and
a
willing
friend
to
those
who
were
the
enemies
of
elizabeth
her
own
lack
of
political
ability
and
the
violent
methods
which
she
employed
to
punish
her
calvinistic
subjects
caused
a
revolution
in
scotland
and
forced
mary
to
take
refuge
on
english
territory
for
eighteen
years
she
remained
in
england
plotting
forever
and
a
day
against
the
woman
who
had
given
her
shelter
and
who
was
at
last
obliged
to
follow
the
advice
of
her
trusted
councilors
to
cutte
off
the
scottish
queen
heade
the
head
was
duly
cutte
off
in
the
year
and
caused
a
war
with
spain
but
the
combined
navies
of
england
and
holland
defeated
invincible
armada
as
we
have
already
seen
and
the
blow
which
had
been
meant
to
destroy
the
power
of
the
two
great
leaders
was
turned
into
a
profitable
business
adventure
for
now
at
last
after
many
years
of
hesitation
the
english
as
well
as
the
dutch
thought
it
their
good
right
to
invade
the
indies
and
america
and
avenge
the
ills
which
their
protestant
brethren
had
suffered
at
the
hands
of
the
spaniards
the
english
had
been
among
the
earliest
successors
of
columbus
british
ships
commanded
by
the
venetian
pilot
giovanni
caboto
or
cabot
had
been
the
first
to
discover
and
explore
the
northern
american
continent
in
labrador
and
newfoundland
were
of
little
importance
as
a
possible
colony
but
the
banks
of
newfoundland
offered
a
rich
reward
to
the
english
fishing
fleet
a
year
later
in
the
same
cabot
had
explored
the
coast
of
florida
then
had
come
the
busy
years
of
henry
vii
and
henry
viii
when
there
had
been
no
money
for
foreign
explorations
but
under
elizabeth
with
the
country
at
peace
and
mary
stuart
in
prison
the
sailors
could
leave
their
harbour
without
fear
for
the
fate
of
those
whom
they
left
behind
while
elizabeth
was
still
a
child
willoughby
had
ventured
to
sail
past
the
north
cape
and
one
of
his
captains
richard
chancellor
pushing
further
eastward
in
his
quest
of
a
possible
road
to
the
indies
had
reached
archangel
russia
where
he
had
established
diplomatic
and
commercial
relations
with
the
mysterious
rulers
of
this
distant
muscovite
empire
during
the
first
years
of
elizabeth
rule
this
voyage
had
been
followed
up
by
many
others
merchant
adventurers
working
for
the
benefit
of
a
joint
stock
company
had
laid
the
foundations
of
trading
companies
which
in

centuries
were
to
become
colonies

be
loaded
into

hold
of

dealers
in

and

with
equal
indifference
to
everything
except
their
profit
the
sailors
of
elizabeth
had
carried
the
english
flag
and
the
fame
of
their
virgin
queen
to
the
four
corners

william
shakespeare
kept
her
majesty
amused
at
home
and
the
best
brains
and
the
best
wit
of
england
with
the
queen
in
her
attempt
to
change
the
feudal
inheritance
of
henry
viii
into
a
modern
national
state
in

year
the
old

died
at
the
age
of
seventy
her
cousin

of
her
own
grandfather
henry
vii
and
son
of
mary
stuart
her
rival
and
enemy
succeeded
her
as
james
i
by
the
grace
of
god
he
found
himself
the
ruler
of
a
country
which
had
escaped
the
fate
of
its
continental
rivals
while
the
european
protestants
and
catholics
were
killing
each
other
in
a
hopeless
attempt
to
break
the
power
of
their
adversaries
and
establish
the
exclusive
rule
of
their
own
particular
creed
england
was
at
peace
and
reformed
at
leisure
without
going
to
the
extremes
of
either
luther
or
loyola
it
gave
the
island
kingdom
an
enormous
advantage
in
the
coming
struggle
for
colonial
possessions
it
assured
england
a
leadership
in
international
affairs
which
that
country
has
maintained
until
the
present
day
not
even
the
disastrous
adventure
with
the
stuarts
was
able
to
stop
this
normal
development
the
stuarts
who
succeeded
the
tudors
were
foreigners
in
england
they
do
not
seem
to
have
appreciated
or
understood
this
fact
the
native
house
of
tudor
could
steal
a
horse
but
the
foreign
stuarts
were
not
allowed
to
look
at
the
bridle
without
causing
great
popular
disapproval
old
queen
bess
had
ruled
her
domains
very
much
as
she
pleased
in
general
however
she
had
always
followed
a
policy
which
meant
money
in
the
pocket
of
the
honest
and
otherwise
british
merchants
hence
the
queen
had
been
always
assured
of
the
wholehearted
support
of
her
grateful
people
and
small
liberties
taken
with
some
of
the
rights
and
prerogatives
of
parliament
were
gladly
overlooked
for
the
ulterior
benefits
which
were
derived
from
her
majesty
strong
and
successful
foreign
policies
outwardly
king
james
continued
the
same
policy
but
he
lacked
that
personal
enthusiasm
which
had
been
so
very
typical
of
his
great
predecessor
foreign
commerce
continued
to
be
encouraged
the
catholics
were
not
granted
any
liberties
but
when
spain
smiled
pleasantly
upon
england
in
an
effort
to
establish
peaceful
relations
james
was
seen
to
smile
back
the
majority
of
the
english
people
did
not
like
this
but
james
was
their
king
and
they
kept
quiet
soon
there
were
other
causes
of
friction
king
james
and
his
son
charles
i
who
succeeded
him
in
the
year
both
firmly
believed
in
the
principle
of
their
divine
right
to
administer
their
realm
as
they
thought
fit
without
consulting
the
wishes
of
their
subjects
the
idea
was
not
new
the
popes
who
in
more
than
one
way
had
been
the
successors
of
the
roman
emperors
or
rather
of
the
roman
imperial
ideal
of
a
single
and
undivided
state
covering
the
entire
known
world
had
always
regarded
themselves
and
had
been
publicly
recognised
as
the
of
christ
upon
earth
no
one
questioned
the
right
of
god
to
rule
the
world
as
he
saw
fit
as
a
natural
result
few
ventured
to
doubt
the
right
of
the
divine
to
do
the
same
thing
and
to
demand
the
obedience
of
the
masses
because
he
was
the
direct
representative
of
the
absolute
ruler
of
the
universe
and
responsible
only
to
almighty
god
when
the
lutheran
reformation
proved
successful
those
rights
which
formerly
had
been
invested
in
the
papacy
were
taken
over
by
the
many
european
sovereigns
who
became
protestants
as
head
of
their
own
national
or
dynastic
churches
they
insisted
upon
being
within
the
limit
of
their
own
territory
the
people
did
not
question
the
right
of
their
rulers
to
take
such
a
step
they
accepted
it
just
as
we
in
our
own
day
accept
the
idea
of
a
representative
system
which
to
us
seems
the
only
reasonable
and
just
form
of
government
it
is
unfair
therefore
to
state
that
either
lutheranism
or
calvinism
caused
the
particular
feeling
of
irritation
which
greeted
oft
and
loudly
repeated
assertion
of
his
divine
right
there
must
have
been
other
grounds
for
the
genuine
english
disbelief
in
the
divine
right
of
kings
the
first
positive
denial
of
the
divine
right
of
sovereigns
had
been
heard
in
the
netherlands
when
the
estates
general
abjured
their
lawful
sovereign
king
philip
ii
of
spain
in
the
year
the
king
so
they
said
has
broken
his
contract
and
the
king
therefore
is
dismissed
like
any
other
unfaithful
servant
since
then
this
particular
idea
of
a
king
responsibilities
towards
his
subjects
had
spread
among
many
of
the
nations
who
inhabited
the
shores
of
the
north
sea
they
were
in
a
very
favourable
position
they
were
rich
the
poor
people
in
the
heart
of
central
europe
at
the
mercy
of
their
ruler
could
not
afford
to
discuss
a
problem
which
would
at
once
land
them
in
the
deepest
dungeon
of
the
nearest
castle
but
the
merchants
of
holland
and
england
who
possessed
the
capital
necessary
for
the
maintenance
of
great
armies
and
navies
who
knew
how
to
handle
the
almighty
weapon
called
credit
had
no
such
fear
they
were
willing
to
pit
the
divine
right
of
their
own
good
money
against
the
divine
right
of
any
habsburg
or
bourbon
or
stuart
they
knew
that
their
guilders
and
shillings
could
beat
the
clumsy
feudal
armies
which
were
the
only
weapons
of
the
king
they
dared
to
act
where
others
were
condemned
to
suffer
in
silence
or
run
the
risk
of
the
scaffold
when
the
stuarts
began
to
annoy
the
people
of
england
with
their
claim
that
they
had
a
right
to
do
what
they
pleased
and
never
mind
the
responsibility
the
english
middle
classes
used
the
house
of
commons
as
their
first
line
of
defence
against
this
abuse
of
the
royal
power
the
crown
refused
to
give
in
and
the
king
sent
parliament
about
its
own
business
eleven
long
years
charles
i
ruled
alone
he
levied
taxes
which
most
people
regarded
as
illegal
and
he
managed
his
british
kingdom
as
if
it
had
been
his
own
country
estate
he
had
capable
assistants
and
we
must
say
that
he
had
the
courage
of
his
convictions
unfortunately
instead
of
assuring
himself
of
the
support
of
his
faithful
scottish
subjects
charles
became
involved
in
a
quarrel
with
the
scotch
presbyterians
much
against
his
will
but
forced
by
his
need
for
ready
cash
charles
was
at
last
obliged
to
call
parliament
together
once
more
it
met
in
april
of
and
showed
an
ugly
temper
it
was
dissolved
a
few
weeks
later
a
new
parliament
convened
in
november
this
one
was
even
less
pliable
than
the
first
one
the
members
understood
that
the
question
of
government
by
divine
right
or
government
by
parliament
must
be
fought
out
for
good
and
all
they
attacked
the
king
in
his
chief
councillors
and
executed
half
a
dozen
of
them
they
announced
that
they
would
not
allow
themselves
to
be
dissolved
without
their
own
approval
finally
on
december
they
presented
to
the
king
a
grand
remonstrance
which
gave
a
detailed
account
of
the
many
grievances
of
the
people
against
their
ruler
charles
hoping
to
derive
some
support
for
his
own
policy
in
the
country
districts
left
london
in
january
of
each
side
organised
an
army
and
prepared
for
open
warfare
between
the
absolute
power
of
the
crown
and
the
absolute
power
of
parliament
during
this
struggle
the
most
powerful
religious
element
of
england
called
the
puritans
they
were
anglicans
who
had
tried
to
purify
their
doctrines
to
the
most
absolute
limits
came
quickly
to
the
front
the
regiments
of
godly
men
commanded
by
oliver
cromwell
with
their
iron
discipline
and
their
profound
confidence
in
the
holiness
of
their
aims
soon
became
the
model
for
the
entire
army
of
the
opposition
twice
charles
was
defeated
after
the
battle
of
naseby
in
he
fled
to
scotland
the
scotch
sold
him
to
the
english
there
followed
a
period
of
intrigue
and
an
uprising
of
the
scotch
presbyterians
against
the
english
puritan
in
august
of
the
year
after
the
battle
of
preston
pans
cromwell
made
an
end
to
this
second
civil
war
and
took
edinburgh
meanwhile
his
soldiers
tired
of
further
talk
and
wasted
hours
of
religious
debate
had
decided
to
act
on
their
own
initiative
they
removed
from
parliament
all
those
who
did
not
agree
with
their
own
puritan
views
thereupon
the
rump
which
was
what
was
left
of
the
old
parliament
accused
the
king
of
high
treason
the
house
of
lords
refused
to
sit
as
a
tribunal
a
special
tribunal
was
appointed
and
it
condemned
the
king
to
death
on
the
of
january
of
the
year
king
charles
walked
quietly
out
of
a
window
of
white
hall
onto
the
scaffold
that
day
the
sovereign
people
acting
through
their
chosen
representatives
for
the
first
time
executed
a
ruler
who
had
failed
to
understand
his
own
position
in
the
modern
state
the
period
which
followed
the
death
of
charles
is
usually
called
after
oliver
cromwell
at
first
the
unofficial
dictator
of
england
he
was
officially
made
lord
protector
in
the
year
he
ruled
five
years
he
used
this
period
to
continue
the
policies
of
elizabeth
spain
once
more
became
the
arch
enemy
of
england
and
war
upon
the
spaniard
was
made
a
national
and
sacred
issue
the
commerce
of
england
and
the
interests
of
the
traders
were
placed
before
everything
else
and
the
protestant
creed
of
the
strictest
nature
was
rigourously
maintained
in
maintaining
england
position
abroad
cromwell
was
successful
as
a
social
reformer
however
he
failed
very
badly
the
world
is
made
up
of
a
number
of
people
and
they
rarely
think
alike
in
the
long
run
this
seems
a
very
wise
provision
a
government
of
and
by
and
for
one
single
part
of
the
entire
community
can
not
possibly
survive
the
puritans
had
been
a
great
force
for
good
when
they
tried
to
correct
the
abuse
of
the
royal
power
as
the
absolute
rulers
of
england
they
became
intolerable
when
cromwell
died
in
it
was
an
easy
matter
for
the
stuarts
to
return
to
their
old
kingdom
indeed
they
were
welcomed
as
deliverers
by
the
people
who
had
found
the
yoke
of
the
meek
puritans
quite
as
hard
to
bear
as
that
of
autocratic
king
charles
provided
the
stuarts
were
willing
to
forget
about
the
divine
right
of
their
late
and
lamented
father
and
were
willing
to
recognise
the
superiority
of
parliament
the
people
promised
that
they
would
be
loyal
and
faithful
subjects
two
generations
tried
to
make
a
success
of
this
new
arrangement
but
the
stuarts
apparently
had
not
learned
their
lesson
and
were
unable
to
drop
their
bad
habits
charles
ii
who
came
back
in
the
year
was
an
amiable
but
worthless
person
his
indolence
and
his
constitutional
insistence
upon
following
the
easiest
course
together
with
his
conspicuous
success
as
a
liar
prevented
an
open
outbreak
between
himself
and
his
people
by
the
act
of
uniformity
in
he
broke
the
power
of
the
puritan
clergy
by
banishing
all
dissenting
clergymen
from
their
parishes
by
the
conventicle
act
of
he
tried
to
prevent
the
dissenters
from
attending
religious
meetings
by
a
threat
of
deportation
to
the
west
indies
this
looked
too
much
like
the
good
old
days
of
divine
right
people
began
to
show
the
old
and
signs
of
impatience
and
parliament
suddenly
experienced
difficulty
in
providing
the
king
with
funds
since
he
could
not
get
money
from
an
unwilling
parliament
charles
borrowed
it
secretly
from
his
neighbour
and
cousin
king
louis
of
france
he
betrayed
his
protestant
allies
in
return
for
pounds
per
year
and
laughed
at
the
poor
simpletons
of
parliament
economic
independence
suddenly
gave
the
king
great
faith
in
his
own
strength
he
had
spent
many
years
of
exile
among
his
catholic
relations
and
he
had
a
secret
liking
for
their
religion
perhaps
he
could
bring
england
back
to
rome
he
passed
a
declaration
of
indulgence
which
suspended
the
old
laws
against
the
catholics
and
dissenters
this
happened
just
when
charles
younger
brother
james
was
said
to
have
become
a
catholic
all
this
looked
suspicious
to
the
man
in
the
street
people
began
to
fear
some
terrible
popish
plot
a
new
spirit
of
unrest
entered
the
land
most
of
the
people
wanted
to
prevent
another
outbreak
of
civil
war
to
them
royal
oppression
and
a
catholic
king
yea
even
divine
right
were
preferable
to
a
new
struggle
between
members
of
the
same
race
others
however
were
less
lenient
they
were
the
dissenters
who
invariably
had
the
courage
of
their
convictions
they
were
led
by
several
great
noblemen
who
did
not
want
to
see
a
return
of
the
old
days
of
absolute
royal
power
for
almost
ten
years
these
two
great
parties
the
whigs
the
middle
class
element
called
by
this
derisive
name
in
the
year
a
lot
of
scottish
whiggamores
or
headed
by
the
presbyterian
clergy
had
marched
to
edinburgh
to
oppose
the
king
and
the
tories
an
epithet
originally
used
against
the
royalist
irish
adherents
but
now
applied
to
the
supporters
of
the
king
opposed
each
other
but
neither
wished
to
bring
about
a
crisis
they
allowed
charles
to
die
peacefully
in
his
bed
and
permitted
the
catholic
james
ii
to
succeed
his
brother
in
but
when
james
after
threatening
the
country
with
the
terrible
foreign
invention
of
a
standing
army
which
was
to
be
commanded
by
catholic
frenchmen
issued
a
second
declaration
of
indulgence
in
and
ordered
it
to
be
read
in
all
anglican
churches
he
went
just
a
trifle
beyond
that
line
of
sensible
demarcation
which
can
only
be
transgressed
by
the
most
popular
of
rulers
under
very
exceptional
circumstances
seven
bishops
refused
to
comply
with
the
royal
command
they
were
accused
of
seditious
libel
they
were
brought
before
a
court
the
jury
which
pronounced
the
verdict
of
not
guilty
reaped
a
rich
harvest
of
popular
approval
at
this
unfortunate
moment
james
who
in
a
second
marriage
had
taken
to
wife
maria
of
the
catholic
house
of
became
the
father
of
a
son
this
meant
that
the
throne
was
to
go
to
a
catholic
boy
rather
than
to
his
older
sisters
mary
and
anne
who
were
protestants
the
man
in
the
street
again
grew
suspicious
maria
of
modena
was
too
old
to
have
children
it
was
all
part
of
a
plot
a
strange
baby
had
been
brought
into
the
palace
by
some
jesuit
priest
that
england
might
have
a
catholic
monarch
and
so
on
it
looked
as
if
another
civil
war
would
break
out
then
seven
men
both
whigs
and
tories
wrote
a
letter
asking
the
husband
of
james
oldest
daughter
mary
william
iii
the
stadtholder
or
head
of
the
dutch
republic
to
come
to
england
and
deliver
the
country
from
its
lawful
but
entirely
undesirable
sovereign
on
the
fifth
of
november
of
the
year
william
landed
at
torbay
as
he
did
not
wish
to
make
a
martyr
out
of
his
he
helped
him
to
escape
safely
to
france
on
the
of
january
of
he
summoned
parliament
on
the
of
february
of
the
same
year
he
and
his
wife
mary
were
proclaimed
joint
sovereigns
of
england
and
the
country
was
saved
for
the
protestant
cause
parliament
having
undertaken
to
be
something
more
than
a
mere
advisory
body
to
the
king
made
the
best
of
its
opportunities
the
old
petition
of
rights
of
the
year
was
fished
out
of
a
forgotten
nook
of
the
archives
a
second
and
more
drastic
bill
of
rights
demanded
that
the
sovereign
of
england
should
belong
to
the
anglican
church
furthermore
it
stated
that
the
king
had
no
right
to
suspend
the
laws
or
permit
certain
privileged
citizens
to
disobey
certain
laws
it
stipulated
that
without
consent
of
parliament
no
taxes
could
be
levied
and
no
army
could
be
maintained
thus
in
the
year
did
england
acquire
an
amount
of
liberty
unknown
in
any
other
country
of
europe
but
it
is
not
only
on
account
of
this
great
liberal
measure
that
the
rule
of
william
in
england
is
still
remembered
during
his
lifetime
government
by
a
responsible
ministry
first
developed
no
king
of
course
can
rule
alone
he
needs
a
few
trusted
advisors
the
tudors
had
their
great
council
which
was
composed
of
nobles
and
clergy
this
body
grew
too
large
it
was
restricted
to
the
small
privy
council
in
the
course
of
time
it
became
the
custom
of
these
councillors
to
meet
the
king
in
a
cabinet
in
the
palace
hence
they
were
called
the
cabinet
council
after
a
short
while
they
were
known
as
the
cabinet
william
like
most
english
sovereigns
before
him
had
chosen
his
advisors
from
among
all
parties
but
with
the
increased
strength
of
parliament
he
had
found
it
impossible
to
direct
the
politics
of
the
country
with
the
help
of
the
tories
while
the
whigs
had
a
majority
in
the
house
of
commons
therefore
the
tories
had
been
dismissed
and
the
cabinet
council
had
been
composed
entirely
of
whigs
a
few
years
later
when
the
whigs
lost
their
power
in
the
house
of
commons
the
king
for
the
sake
of
convenience
was
obliged
to
look
for
his
support
among
the
leading
tories
until
his
death
in
william
was
too
busy
fighting
louis
of
france
to
bother
much
about
the
government
of
england
practically
all
important
affairs
had
been
left
to
his
cabinet
council
when
william
anne
succeeded
him
in
this
condition
of
affairs
continued
when
she
died
in
and
unfortunately
not
a
single
one
of
her
seventeen
children
survived
her
the
throne
went
to
george
i
of
the
house
of
hanover
the
son
of
sophie
of
james
i
this
somewhat
rustic
monarch
who
never
learned
a
word
of
english
was
entirely
lost
in
the
complicated
mazes
of
england
political
arrangements
he
left
everything
to
his
cabinet
council
and
kept
away
from
their
meetings
which
bored
him
as
he
did
not
understand
a
single
sentence
in
this
way
the
cabinet
got
into
the
habit
of
ruling
england
and
scotland
whose
parliament
had
been
joined
to
that
of
england
in
without
bothering
the
king
who
was
apt
to
spend
a
great
deal
of
his
time
on
the
continent
during
the
reign
of
george
i
and
george
ii
a
succession
of
great
whigs
of
whom
one
sir
robert
walpole
held
office
for
years
formed
the
cabinet
council
of
the
king
their
leader
was
finally
recognised
as
the
official
leader
not
only
of
the
actual
cabinet
but
also
of
the
majority
party
in
power
in
parliament
the
attempts
of
george
iii
to
take
matters
into
his
own
hands
and
not
to
leave
the
actual
business
of
government
to
his
cabinet
were
so
disastrous
that
they
were
never
repeated
and
from
the
earliest
years
of
the
eighteenth
century
on
england
enjoyed
representative
government
with
a
responsible
ministry
which
conducted
the
affairs
of
the
land
to
be
quite
true
this
government
did
not
represent
all
classes
of
society
less
than
one
man
in
a
dozen
had
the
right
to
vote
but
it
was
the
foundation
for
the
modern
representative
form
of
government
in
a
quiet
and
orderly
fashion
it
took
the
power
away
from
the
king
and
placed
it
in
the
hands
of
an
ever
increasing
number
of
popular
representatives
it
did
not
bring
the
millenium
to
england
but
it
saved
that
country
from
most
of
the
revolutionary
outbreaks
which
proved
so
disastrous
to
the
european
continent
in
the
eighteenth
and
nineteenth
centuries
the
balance
of
power
in
france
on
the
other
hand
the
divine
right
of
kings
continued
with
greater
pomp
and
splendour
than
ever
before
and
the
ambition
of
the
ruler
was
only
tempered
by
the
newly
invented
law
of
the
balance
of
power
as
a
contrast
to
the
previous
chapter
let
me
tell
you
what
happened
in
france
during
the
years
when
the
english
people
were
fighting
for
their
liberty
the
happy
combination
of
the
right
man
in
the
right
country
at
the
right
moment
is
very
rare
in
history
louis
xiv
was
a
realisation
of
this
ideal
as
far
as
france
was
concerned
but
the
rest
of
europe
would
have
been
happier
without
him
the
country
over
which
the
young
king
was
called
to
rule
was
the
most
populous
and
the
most
brilliant
nation
of
that
day
louis
came
to
the
throne
when
mazarin
and
richelieu
the
two
great
cardinals
had
just
hammered
the
ancient
french
kingdom
into
the
most
strongly
centralised
state
of
the
seventeenth
century
he
was
himself
a
man
of
extraordinary
ability
we
the
people
of
the
twentieth
century
are
still
surrounded
by
the
memories
of
the
glorious
age
of
the
sun
king
our
social
life
is
based
upon
the
perfection
of
manners
and
the
elegance
of
expression
attained
at
the
court
of
louis
in
international
and
diplomatic
relations
french
is
still
the
official
language
of
diplomacy
and
international
gatherings
because
two
centuries
ago
it
reached
a
polished
elegance
and
a
purity
of
expression
which
no
other
tongue
had
as
yet
been
able
to
equal
the
theatre
of
king
louis
still
teaches
us
lessons
which
we
are
only
too
slow
in
learning
during
his
reign
the
french
academy
an
invention
of
richelieu
came
to
occupy
a
position
in
the
world
of
letters
which
other
countries
have
flattered
by
their
imitation
we
might
continue
this
list
for
many
pages
it
is
no
matter
of
mere
chance
that
our
modern
is
printed
in
french
the
very
difficult
art
of
decent
cooking
one
of
the
highest
expressions
of
civilisation
was
first
practiced
for
the
benefit
of
the
great
monarch
the
age
of
louis
xiv
was
a
time
of
splendour
and
grace
which
can
still
teach
us
a
lot
unfortunately
this
brilliant
picture
has
another
side
which
was
far
less
encouraging
glory
abroad
too
often
means
misery
at
home
and
france
was
no
exception
to
this
rule
louis
xiv
succeeded
his
father
in
the
year
he
died
in
the
year
that
means
that
the
government
of
france
was
in
the
hands
of
one
single
man
for
years
almost
two
whole
generations
it
will
be
well
to
get
a
firm
grasp
of
this
idea
one
single
man
louis
was
the
first
of
a
long
list
of
monarchs
who
in
many
countries
established
that
particular
form
of
highly
efficient
autocracy
which
we
call
enlightened
despotism
he
did
not
like
kings
who
merely
played
at
being
rulers
and
turned
official
affairs
into
a
pleasant
picnic
the
kings
of
that
enlightened
age
worked
harder
than
any
of
their
subjects
they
got
up
earlier
and
went
to
bed
later
than
anybody
else
and
felt
their
divine
responsibility
quite
as
strongly
as
their
divine
right
which
allowed
them
to
rule
without
consulting
their
subjects
of
course
the
king
could
not
attend
to
everything
in
person
he
was
obliged
to
surround
himself
with
a
few
helpers
and
councillors
one
or
two
generals
some
experts
upon
foreign
politics
a
few
clever
financiers
and
economists
would
do
for
this
purpose
but
these
dignitaries
could
act
only
through
their
sovereign
they
had
no
individual
existence
to
the
mass
of
the
people
the
sovereign
actually
represented
in
his
own
sacred
person
the
government
of
their
country
the
glory
of
the
common
fatherland
became
the
glory
of
a
single
dynasty
it
meant
the
exact
opposite
of
our
own
american
ideal
france
was
ruled
of
and
by
and
for
the
house
of
bourbon
the
disadvantages
of
such
a
system
are
clear
the
king
grew
to
be
everything
everybody
else
grew
to
be
nothing
at
all
the
old
and
useful
nobility
was
gradually
forced
to
give
up
its
former
shares
in
the
government
of
the
provinces
a
little
royal
bureaucrat
his
fingers
splashed
with
ink
sitting
behind
the
greenish
windows
of
a
government
building
in
faraway
paris
now
performed
the
task
which
a
hundred
years
before
had
been
the
duty
of
the
feudal
lord
the
feudal
lord
deprived
of
all
work
moved
to
paris
to
amuse
himself
as
best
he
could
at
the
court
soon
his
estates
began
to
suffer
from
that
very
dangerous
economic
sickness
known
as
absentee
landlordism
within
a
single
generation
the
industrious
and
useful
feudal
administrators
had
become
the
but
quite
useless
loafers
of
the
court
of
versailles
louis
was
ten
years
old
when
the
peace
of
westphalia
was
concluded
and
the
house
of
habsburg
as
a
result
of
the
thirty
years
war
lost
its
predominant
position
in
europe
it
was
inevitable
that
a
man
with
his
ambition
should
use
so
favourable
a
moment
to
gain
for
his
own
dynasty
the
honours
which
had
formerly
been
held
by
the
habsburgs
in
the
year
louis
had
married
maria
theresa
daughter
of
the
king
of
spain
soon
afterward
his
philip
iv
one
of
the
spanish
habsburgs
died
at
once
louis
claimed
the
spanish
netherlands
belgium
as
part
of
his
wife
dowry
such
an
acquisition
would
have
been
disastrous
to
the
peace
of
europe
and
would
have
threatened
the
safety
of
the
protestant
states
under
the
leadership
of
jan
de
witt
raadpensionaris
or
foreign
minister
of
the
united
seven
netherlands
the
first
great
international
alliance
the
triple
alliance
of
sweden
england
and
holland
of
the
year
was
concluded
it
did
not
last
long
with
money
and
fair
promises
louis
bought
up
both
king
charles
and
the
swedish
estates
holland
was
betrayed
by
her
allies
and
was
left
to
her
own
fate
in
the
year
the
french
invaded
the
low
countries
they
marched
to
the
heart
of
the
country
for
a
second
time
the
dikes
were
opened
and
the
royal
sun
of
france
set
amidst
the
mud
of
the
dutch
marshes
the
peace
of
nimwegen
which
was
concluded
in
settled
nothing
but
merely
anticipated
another
war
a
second
war
of
aggression
from
to
ending
with
the
peace
of
ryswick
also
failed
to
give
louis
that
position
in
the
affairs
of
europe
to
which
he
aspired
his
old
enemy
jan
de
witt
had
been
murdered
by
the
dutch
rabble
but
his
successor
william
iii
whom
you
met
in
the
last
chapter
had
checkmated
all
efforts
of
louis
to
make
france
the
ruler
of
europe
the
great
war
for
the
spanish
succession
begun
in
the
year
immediately
after
the
death
of
charles
ii
the
last
of
the
spanish
habsburgs
and
ended
in
by
the
peace
of
utrecht
remained
equally
undecided
but
it
had
ruined
the
treasury
of
louis
on
land
the
french
king
had
been
victorious
but
the
navies
of
england
and
holland
had
spoiled
all
hope
for
an
ultimate
french
victory
besides
the
long
struggle
had
given
birth
to
a
new
and
fundamental
principle
of
international
politics
which
thereafter
made
it
impossible
for
one
single
nation
to
rule
the
whole
of
europe
or
the
whole
of
the
world
for
any
length
of
time
that
was
the
balance
of
power
it
was
not
a
written
law
but
for
three
centuries
it
has
been
obeyed
as
closely
as
are
the
laws
of
nature
the
people
who
originated
the
idea
maintained
that
europe
in
its
nationalistic
stage
of
development
could
only
survive
when
there
should
be
an
absolute
balance
of
the
many
conflicting
interests
of
the
entire
continent
no
single
power
or
single
dynasty
must
ever
be
allowed
to
dominate
the
others
during
the
thirty
years
war
the
habsburgs
had
been
the
victims
of
the
application
of
this
law
they
however
had
been
unconscious
victims
the
issues
during
that
struggle
were
so
clouded
in
a
haze
of
religious
strife
that
we
do
not
get
a
very
clear
view
of
the
main
tendencies
of
that
great
conflict
but
from
that
time
on
we
begin
to
see
how
cold
economic
considerations
and
calculations
prevail
in
all
matters
of
international
importance
we
discover
the
development
of
a
new
type
of
statesman
the
statesman
with
the
personal
feelings
of
the
and
the
jan
de
witt
was
the
first
successful
exponent
of
this
new
school
of
politics
william
iii
was
the
first
great
pupil
and
louis
xiv
with
all
his
fame
and
glory
was
the
first
conscious
victim
there
have
been
many
others
since
the
rise
of
russia
the
story
of
the
mysterious
moscovite
empire
which
suddenly
burst
upon
the
grand
political
stage
of
europe
in
the
year
as
you
know
columbus
discovered
america
early
in
the
year
a
tyrolese
by
the
name
of
schnups
travelling
as
the
head
of
a
scientific
expedition
for
the
archbishop
of
tyrol
and
provided
with
the
best
letters
of
introduction
and
excellent
credit
tried
to
reach
the
mythical
town
of
moscow
he
did
not
succeed
when
he
reached
the
frontiers
of
this
vast
moscovite
state
which
was
vaguely
supposed
to
exist
in
the
extreme
eastern
part
of
europe
he
was
firmly
turned
back
no
foreigners
were
wanted
and
schnups
went
to
visit
the
heathen
turk
in
constantinople
in
order
that
he
might
have
something
to
report
to
his
clerical
master
when
he
came
back
from
his
explorations
years
later
richard
chancellor
trying
to
discover
the
passage
to
the
indies
and
blown
by
an
ill
wind
into
the
white
sea
reached
the
mouth
of
the
dwina
and
found
the
moscovite
village
of
kholmogory
a
few
hours
from
the
spot
where
in
the
town
of
archangel
was
founded
this
time
the
foreign
visitors
were
requested
to
come
to
moscow
and
show
themselves
to
the
grand
duke
they
went
and
returned
to
england
with
the
first
commercial
treaty
ever
concluded
between
russia
and
the
western
world
other
nations
soon
followed
and
something
became
known
of
this
mysterious
land
geographically
russia
is
a
vast
plain
the
ural
mountains
are
low
and
form
no
barrier
against
invaders
the
rivers
are
broad
but
often
shallow
it
was
an
ideal
territory
for
nomads
while
the
roman
empire
was
founded
grew
in
power
and
disappeared
again
slavic
tribes
who
had
long
since
left
their
homes
in
central
asia
wandered
aimlessly
through
the
forests
and
plains
of
the
region
between
the
dniester
and
dnieper
rivers
the
greeks
had
sometimes
met
these
slavs
and
a
few
travellers
of
the
third
and
fourth
centuries
mention
them
otherwise
they
were
as
little
known
as
were
the
nevada
indians
in
the
year
unfortunately
for
the
peace
of
these
primitive
peoples
a
very
convenient
ran
through
their
country
this
was
the
main
road
from
northern
europe
to
constantinople
it
followed
the
coast
of
the
baltic
until
the
neva
was
reached
then
it
crossed
lake
ladoga
and
went
southward
along
the
volkhov
river
then
through
lake
ilmen
and
up
the
small
lovat
river
then
there
was
a
short
portage
until
the
dnieper
was
reached
then
down
the
dnieper
into
the
black
sea
the
norsemen
knew
of
this
road
at
a
very
early
date
in
the
ninth
century
they
began
to
settle
in
northern
russia
just
as
other
norsemen
were
laying
the
foundation
for
independent
states
in
germany
and
france
but
in
the
year
three
norsemen
brothers
crossed
the
baltic
and
founded
three
small
dynasties
of
the
three
brothers
only
one
rurik
lived
for
a
number
of
years
he
took
possession
of
the
territory
of
his
brothers
and
twenty
years
after
the
arrival
of
this
first
norseman
a
slavic
state
had
been
established
with
kiev
as
its
capital
from
kiev
to
the
black
sea
is
a
short
distance
soon
the
existence
of
an
organised
slavic
state
became
known
in
constantinople
this
meant
a
new
field
for
the
zealous
missionaries
of
the
christian
faith
byzantine
monks
followed
the
dnieper
on
their
way
northward
and
soon
reached
the
heart
of
russia
they
found
the
people
worshipping
strange
gods
who
were
supposed
to
dwell
in
woods
and
rivers
and
in
mountain
caves
they
taught
them
the
story
of
jesus
there
was
no
competition
from
the
side
of
roman
missionaries
these
good
men
were
too
busy
educating
the
heathen
teutons
to
bother
about
the
distant
slavs
hence
russia
received
its
religion
and
its
alphabet
and
its
first
ideas
of
art
and
architecture
from
the
byzantine
monks
and
as
the
byzantine
empire
a
relic
of
the
eastern
roman
empire
had
become
very
oriental
and
had
lost
many
of
its
european
traits
the
russians
suffered
in
consequence
politically
speaking
these
new
states
of
the
great
russian
plains
did
not
fare
well
it
was
the
norse
habit
to
divide
every
inheritance
equally
among
all
the
sons
no
sooner
had
a
small
state
been
founded
but
it
was
broken
up
among
eight
or
nine
heirs
who
in
turn
left
their
territory
to
an
ever
increasing
number
of
descendants
it
was
inevitable
that
these
small
competing
states
should
quarrel
among
themselves
anarchy
was
the
order
of
the
day
and
when
the
red
glow
of
the
eastern
horizon
told
the
people
of
the
threatened
invasion
of
a
savage
asiatic
tribe
the
little
states
were
too
weak
and
too
divided
to
render
any
sort
of
defence
against
this
terrible
enemy
it
was
in
the
year
that
the
first
great
tartar
invasion
took
place
and
that
the
hordes
of
jenghiz
khan
the
conqueror
of
china
bokhara
tashkent
and
turkestan
made
their
first
appearance
in
the
west
the
slavic
armies
were
beaten
near
the
kalka
river
and
russia
was
at
the
mercy
of
the
mongolians
just
as
suddenly
as
they
had
come
they
disappeared
thirteen
years
later
in
however
they
returned
in
less
than
five
years
they
conquered
every
part
of
the
vast
russian
plains
until
the
year
when
dmitry
donskoi
grand
duke
of
moscow
beat
them
on
the
plains
of
kulikovo
the
tartars
were
the
masters
of
the
russian
people
all
in
all
it
took
the
russians
two
centuries
to
deliver
themselves
from
this
yoke
for
a
yoke
it
was
and
a
most
offensive
and
objectionable
one
it
turned
the
slavic
peasants
into
miserable
slaves
no
russian
could
hope
to
survive
he
was
willing
to
creep
before
a
dirty
little
yellow
man
who
sat
in
a
tent
somewhere
in
the
heart
of
the
steppes
of
southern
russia
and
spat
at
him
it
deprived
the
mass
of
the
people
of
all
feeling
of
honour
and
independence
it
made
hunger
and
misery
and
maltreatment
and
personal
abuse
the
normal
state
of
human
existence
until
at
last
the
average
russian
were
he
peasant
or
nobleman
went
about
his
business
like
a
neglected
dog
who
has
been
beaten
so
often
that
his
spirit
has
been
broken
and
he
dare
not
wag
his
tail
without
permission
there
was
no
escape
the
horsemen
of
the
tartar
khan
were
fast
and
merciless
the
endless
prairie
did
not
give
a
man
a
chance
to
cross
into
the
safe
territory
of
his
neighbour
he
must
keep
quiet
and
bear
what
his
yellow
master
decided
to
inflict
upon
him
or
run
the
risk
of
death
of
course
europe
might
have
interfered
but
europe
was
engaged
upon
business
of
its
own
fighting
the
quarrels
between
the
pope
and
the
emperor
or
suppressing
this
or
that
or
the
other
heresy
and
so
europe
left
the
slav
to
his
fate
and
forced
him
to
work
out
his
own
salvation
the
final
saviour
of
russia
was
one
of
the
many
small
states
founded
by
the
early
norse
rulers
it
was
situated
in
the
heart
of
the
russian
plain
its
capital
moscow
was
upon
a
steep
hill
on
the
banks
of
the
moskwa
river
this
little
principality
by
dint
of
pleasing
the
tartar
when
it
was
necessary
to
please
and
opposing
him
when
it
was
safe
to
do
so
had
during
the
middle
of
the
fourteenth
century
made
itself
the
leader
of
a
new
national
life
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
tartars
were
wholly
deficient
in
constructive
political
ability
they
could
only
destroy
their
chief
aim
in
conquering
new
territories
was
to
obtain
revenue
to
get
this
revenue
in
the
form
of
taxes
it
was
necessary
to
allow
certain
remnants
of
the
old
political
organization
to
continue
hence
there
were
many
little
towns
surviving
by
the
grace
of
the
great
khan
that
they
might
act
as
and
rob
their
neighbours
for
the
benefit
of
the
tartar
treasury
the
state
of
moscow
growing
fat
at
the
expense
of
the
surrounding
territory
finally
became
strong
enough
to
risk
open
rebellion
against
its
masters
the
tartars
it
was
successful
and
its
fame
as
the
leader
in
the
cause
of
russian
independence
made
moscow
the
natural
centre
for
all
those
who
still
believed
in
a
better
future
for
the
slavic
race
in
the
year
constantinople
was
taken
by
the
turks
ten
years
later
under
the
rule
of
ivan
iii
moscow
informed
the
western
world
that
the
slavic
state
laid
claim
to
the
worldly
and
spiritual
inheritance
of
the
lost
byzantine
empire
and
such
traditions
of
the
roman
empire
as
had
survived
in
constantinople
a
generation
afterwards
under
ivan
the
terrible
the
grand
dukes
of
moscow
were
strong
enough
to
adopt
the
title
of
caesar
or
tsar
and
to
demand
recognition
by
the
western
powers
of
europe
in
the
year
with
feodor
the
first
the
old
muscovite
dynasty
descendants
of
the
original
norseman
rurik
came
to
an
end
for
the
next
seven
years
a
tartar
by
the
name
of
boris
godunow
reigned
as
tsar
it
was
during
this
period
that
the
future
destiny
of
the
large
masses
of
the
russian
people
was
decided
this
empire
was
rich
in
land
but
very
poor
in
money
there
was
no
trade
and
there
were
no
factories
its
few
cities
were
dirty
villages
it
was
composed
of
a
strong
central
government
and
a
vast
number
of
illiterate
peasants
this
government
a
mixture
of
slavic
norse
byzantine
and
tartar
influences
recognised
nothing
beyond
the
interest
of
the
state
to
defend
this
state
it
needed
an
army
to
gather
the
taxes
which
were
necessary
to
pay
the
soldiers
it
needed
civil
servants
to
pay
these
many
officials
it
needed
land
in
the
vast
wilderness
on
the
east
and
west
there
was
a
sufficient
supply
of
this
commodity
but
land
without
a
few
labourers
to
till
the
fields
and
tend
the
cattle
has
no
value
therefore
the
old
nomadic
peasants
were
robbed
of
one
privilege
after
the
other
until
finally
during
the
first
year
of
the
sixteenth
century
they
were
formally
made
a
part
of
the
soil
upon
which
they
lived
the
russian
peasants
ceased
to
be
free
men
they
became
serfs
or
slaves
and
they
remained
serfs
until
the
year
when
their
fate
had
become
so
terrible
that
they
were
beginning
to
die
out
in
the
seventeenth
century
this
new
state
with
its
growing
territory
which
was
spreading
quickly
into
siberia
had
become
a
force
with
which
the
rest
of
europe
was
obliged
to
reckon
in
after
the
death
of
boris
godunow
the
russian
nobles
had
elected
one
of
their
own
number
to
be
tsar
he
was
michael
the
son
of
feodor
of
the
moscow
family
of
romanow
who
lived
in
a
little
house
just
outside
the
kremlin
in
the
year
his
peter
the
son
of
another
feodor
was
born
when
the
child
was
ten
years
old
his
sophia
took
possession
of
the
russian
throne
the
little
boy
was
allowed
to
spend
his
days
in
the
suburbs
of
the
national
capital
where
the
foreigners
lived
surrounded
by
scotch
barkeepers
dutch
traders
swiss
apothecaries
italian
barbers
french
dancing
teachers
and
german
the
young
prince
obtained
a
first
but
rather
extraordinary
impression
of
that
and
mysterious
europe
where
things
were
done
differently
when
he
was
seventeen
years
old
he
suddenly
pushed
sister
sophia
from
the
throne
peter
himself
became
the
ruler
of
russia
he
was
not
contented
with
being
the
tsar
of
a
and
people
he
must
be
the
sovereign
head
of
a
civilised
nation
to
change
russia
overnight
from
a
state
into
a
european
empire
was
no
small
undertaking
it
needed
strong
hands
and
a
capable
head
peter
possessed
both
in
the
year
the
great
operation
of
grafting
modern
europe
upon
ancient
russia
was
performed
the
patient
did
not
die
but
he
never
got
over
the
shock
as
the
events
of
the
last
five
years
have
shown
very
plainly
russia
sweden
russia
and
sweden
fight
many
wars
to
decide
who
shall
be
the
leading
power
of
europe
in
the
year
tsar
peter
set
forth
upon
his
first
voyage
to
western
europe
he
travelled
by
way
of
berlin
and
went
to
holland
and
to
england
as
a
child
he
had
almost
been
drowned
sailing
a
homemade
boat
in
the
duck
pond
of
his
father
country
home
this
passion
for
water
remained
with
him
to
the
end
of
his
life
in
a
practical
way
it
showed
itself
in
his
wish
to
give
his
domains
access
to
the
open
sea
while
the
unpopular
and
harsh
young
ruler
was
away
from
home
the
friends
of
the
old
russian
ways
in
moscow
set
to
work
to
undo
all
his
reforms
a
sudden
rebellion
among
his
the
streltsi
regiment
forced
peter
to
hasten
home
by
the
fast
mail
he
appointed
himself
and
the
streltsi
were
hanged
and
quartered
and
killed
to
the
last
man
sister
sophia
who
had
been
the
head
of
the
rebellion
was
locked
up
in
a
cloister
and
the
rule
of
peter
in
earnest
this
scene
was
repeated
in
the
year
when
peter
had
gone
on
his
second
western
trip
that
time
the
reactionaries
followed
the
leadership
of
peter
son
alexis
again
the
tsar
returned
in
great
haste
alexis
was
beaten
to
death
in
his
prison
cell
and
the
friends
of
the
old
fashioned
byzantine
ways
marched
thousands
of
dreary
miles
to
their
final
destination
in
the
siberian
lead
mines
after
that
no
further
outbreaks
of
popular
discontent
took
place
until
the
time
of
his
death
peter
could
reform
in
peace
it
is
not
easy
to
give
you
a
list
of
his
reforms
in
chronological
order
the
tsar
worked
with
furious
haste
he
followed
no
system
he
issued
his
decrees
with
such
rapidity
that
it
is
difficult
to
keep
count
peter
seemed
to
feel
that
everything
that
had
ever
happened
before
was
entirely
wrong
the
whole
of
russia
therefore
must
be
changed
within
the
shortest
possible
time
when
he
died
he
left
behind
a
army
of
men
and
a
navy
of
fifty
ships
the
old
system
of
government
had
been
abolished
over
night
the
duma
or
convention
of
nobles
had
been
dismissed
and
in
its
stead
the
tsar
had
surrounded
himself
with
an
advisory
board
of
state
officials
called
the
senate
russia
was
divided
into
eight
large
governments
or
provinces
roads
were
constructed
towns
were
built
industries
were
created
wherever
it
pleased
the
tsar
without
any
regard
for
the
presence
of
raw
material
canals
were
dug
and
mines
were
opened
in
the
mountains
of
the
east
in
this
land
of
illiterates
schools
were
founded
and
establishments
of
higher
learning
together
with
universities
and
hospitals
and
professional
schools
dutch
naval
engineers
and
tradesmen
and
artisans
from
all
over
the
world
were
encouraged
to
move
to
russia
printing
shops
were
established
but
all
books
must
be
first
read
by
the
imperial
censors
the
duties
of
each
class
of
society
were
carefully
written
down
in
a
new
law
and
the
entire
system
of
civil
and
criminal
laws
was
gathered
into
a
series
of
printed
volumes
the
old
russian
costumes
were
abolished
by
imperial
decree
and
policemen
armed
with
scissors
watching
all
the
country
roads
changed
the
russian
suddenly
into
a
pleasing
imitation
of
west
europeans
in
religious
matters
the
tsar
tolerated
no
division
of
power
there
must
be
no
chance
of
a
rivalry
between
an
emperor
and
a
pope
as
had
happened
in
europe
in
the
year
peter
made
himself
head
of
the
russian
church
the
patriarchate
of
moscow
was
abolished
and
the
holy
synod
made
its
appearance
as
the
highest
source
of
authority
in
all
matters
of
the
established
church
since
however
these
many
reforms
could
not
be
while
the
old
russian
elements
had
a
rallying
point
in
the
town
of
moscow
peter
decided
to
move
his
government
to
a
new
capital
amidst
the
unhealthy
marshes
of
the
baltic
sea
the
tsar
built
this
new
city
he
began
to
reclaim
the
land
in
the
year
forty
thousand
peasants
worked
for
years
to
lay
the
foundations
for
this
imperial
city
the
swedes
attacked
peter
and
tried
to
destroy
his
town
and
illness
and
misery
killed
tens
of
thousands
of
the
peasants
but
the
work
was
continued
winter
and
summer
and
the
town
soon
began
to
grow
in
the
year
it
was
officially
to
be
the
imperial
residence
a
dozen
years
later
it
had
inhabitants
twice
a
year
the
whole
city
was
flooded
by
the
neva
but
the
terrific
of
the
tsar
created
dykes
and
canals
and
the
floods
ceased
to
do
harm
when
peter
died
in
he
was
the
owner
of
the
largest
city
in
northern
europe
of
course
this
sudden
growth
of
so
dangerous
a
rival
had
been
a
source
of
great
worry
to
all
the
neighbours
from
his
side
peter
had
watched
with
interest
the
many
adventures
of
his
baltic
rival
the
kingdom
of
sweden
in
the
year
christina
the
only
daughter
of
gustavus
adolphus
the
hero
of
the
thirty
years
war
had
renounced
the
throne
and
had
gone
to
rome
to
end
her
days
as
a
devout
catholic
a
protestant
nephew
of
gustavus
adolphus
had
succeeded
the
last
queen
of
the
house
of
vasa
under
charles
x
and
charles
xi
the
new
dynasty
had
brought
sweden
to
its
highest
point
of
development
but
in
charles
xi
died
suddenly
and
was
succeeded
by
a
boy
of
fifteen
charles
xii
this
was
the
moment
for
which
many
of
the
northern
states
had
waited
during
the
great
religious
wars
of
the
seventeenth
century
sweden
had
grown
at
the
expense
of
her
neighbours
the
time
had
come
so
the
owners
thought
to
balance
the
account
at
once
war
broke
out
between
russia
poland
denmark
and
saxony
on
the
one
side
and
sweden
on
the
other
the
raw
and
untrained
armies
of
peter
were
disastrously
beaten
by
charles
in
the
famous
battle
of
narva
in
november
of
the
year
then
charles
one
of
the
most
interesting
military
geniuses
of
that
century
turned
against
his
other
enemies
and
for
nine
years
he
hacked
and
burned
his
way
through
the
villages
and
cities
of
poland
saxony
denmark
and
the
baltic
provinces
while
peter
drilled
and
trained
his
soldiers
in
distant
russia
as
a
result
in
the
year
in
the
battle
of
poltawa
the
moscovites
destroyed
the
exhausted
armies
of
sweden
charles
continued
to
be
a
highly
picturesque
figure
a
wonderful
hero
of
romance
but
in
his
vain
attempt
to
have
his
revenge
he
ruined
his
own
country
in
the
year
he
was
accidentally
killed
or
assassinated
we
do
not
know
which
and
when
peace
was
made
in
in
the
town
of
nystadt
sweden
had
lost
all
of
her
former
baltic
possessions
except
finland
the
new
russian
state
created
by
peter
had
become
the
leading
power
of
northern
europe
but
already
a
new
rival
was
on
the
way
the
prussian
state
was
taking
shape
the
rise
of
prussia
the
extraordinary
rise
of
a
little
state
in
a
dreary
part
of
northern
germany
called
prussia
the
history
of
prussia
is
the
history
of
a
frontier
district
in
the
ninth
century
charlemagne
had
transferred
the
old
centre
of
civilisation
from
the
mediterranean
to
the
wild
regions
of
northwestern
europe
his
frankish
soldiers
had
pushed
the
frontier
of
europe
further
and
further
towards
the
east
they
had
conquered
many
lands
from
the
heathenish
slavs
and
lithuanians
who
were
living
in
the
plain
between
the
baltic
sea
and
the
carpathian
mountains
and
the
franks
administered
those
outlying
districts
just
as
the
united
states
used
to
administer
her
territories
before
they
achieved
the
dignity
of
statehood
the
frontier
state
of
brandenburg
had
been
originally
founded
by
charlemagne
to
defend
his
eastern
possessions
against
raids
of
the
wild
saxon
tribes
the
wends
a
slavic
tribe
which
inhabited
that
region
were
subjugated
during
the
tenth
century
and
their
by
the
name
of
brennabor
became
the
centre
of
and
gave
its
name
to
the
new
province
of
brandenburg
during
the
eleventh
twelfth
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
centuries
a
succession
of
noble
families
exercised
the
functions
of
imperial
governor
in
this
frontier
state
finally
in
the
fifteenth
century
the
house
of
hohenzollern
made
its
and
as
electors
of
brandenburg
commenced
to
change
a
sandy
and
forlorn
frontier
territory
into
one
of
the
most
efficient
empires
of
the
modern
world
these
hohenzollerns
who
have
just
been
removed
from
the
historical
stage
by
the
combined
forces
of
europe
and
america
came
originally
from
southern
germany
they
were
of
very
humble
origin
in
the
twelfth
century
a
certain
frederick
of
hohenzollern
had
made
a
lucky
marriage
and
had
been
appointed
keeper
of
the
castle
of
nuremberg
his
descendants
had
used
every
chance
and
every
opportunity
to
improve
their
power
and
after
several
centuries
of
watchful
grabbing
they
had
been
appointed
to
the
dignity
of
elector
the
name
given
to
those
sovereign
princes
who
were
supposed
to
elect
the
emperors
of
the
old
german
empire
during
the
reformation
they
had
taken
the
side
of
the
protestants
and
the
early
seventeenth
century
found
them
among
the
most
powerful
of
the
north
german
princes
during
the
thirty
years
war
both
protestants
and
catholics
had
plundered
brandenburg
and
prussia
with
equal
zeal
but
under
frederick
william
the
great
elector
the
damage
was
quickly
repaired
and
by
a
wise
and
careful
use
of
all
the
economic
and
intellectual
forces
of
the
country
a
state
was
founded
in
which
there
was
practically
no
waste
modern
prussia
a
state
in
which
the
individual
and
his
wishes
and
aspirations
have
been
entirely
absorbed
by
the
interests
of
the
community
as
a
whole
this
prussia
dates
back
to
the
father
of
frederick
the
great
frederick
william
i
was
a
hard
working
parsimonious
prussian
sergeant
with
a
great
love
for
stories
and
strong
dutch
tobacco
an
intense
dislike
of
all
frills
and
feathers
especially
if
they
were
of
french
origin
and
possessed
of
but
one
idea
that
idea
was
duty
severe
with
himself
he
tolerated
no
weakness
in
his
subjects
whether
they
be
generals
or
common
soldiers
the
relation
between
himself
and
his
son
frederick
was
never
cordial
to
say
the
least
the
boorish
manners
of
the
father
offended
the
finer
spirit
of
the
son
the
son
love
for
french
manners
literature
philosophy
and
music
was
rejected
by
the
father
as
a
manifestation
of
there
followed
a
terrible
outbreak
between
these
two
strange
temperaments
frederick
tried
to
escape
to
england
he
was
caught
and
and
forced
to
witness
the
decapitation
of
his
best
friend
who
had
tried
to
help
him
thereupon
as
part
of
his
punishment
the
young
prince
was
sent
to
a
little
fortress
somewhere
in
the
provinces
to
be
taught
the
details
of
his
future
business
of
being
a
king
it
proved
a
blessing
in
disguise
when
frederick
came
to
the
throne
in
he
knew
how
his
country
was
managed
from
the
birth
certificate
of
a
pauper
son
to
the
minutest
detail
of
a
complicated
annual
budget
as
an
author
especially
in
his
book
called
the
frederick
had
expressed
his
contempt
for
the
political
creed
of
the
ancient
florentine
historian
who
had
advised
his
princely
pupils
to
lie
and
cheat
whenever
it
was
necessary
to
do
so
for
the
benefit
of
their
country
the
ideal
ruler
in
frederick
volume
was
the
first
servant
of
his
people
the
enlightened
despot
after
the
example
of
louis
xiv
in
practice
however
frederick
while
working
for
his
people
twenty
hours
a
day
tolerated
no
one
to
be
near
him
as
a
counsellor
his
ministers
were
superior
clerks
prussia
was
his
private
possession
to
be
treated
according
to
his
own
wishes
and
nothing
was
allowed
to
interfere
with
the
interest
of
the
state
in
the
year
the
emperor
charles
vi
of
austria
died
he
had
tried
to
make
the
position
of
his
only
daughter
maria
theresa
secure
through
a
solemn
treaty
written
black
on
white
upon
a
large
piece
of
parchment
but
no
sooner
had
the
old
emperor
been
deposited
in
the
ancestral
crypt
of
the
habsburg
family
than
the
armies
of
frederick
were
marching
towards
the
austrian
frontier
to
occupy
that
part
of
silesia
for
which
together
with
almost
everything
else
in
central
europe
prussia
clamored
on
account
of
some
ancient
and
very
doubtful
rights
of
claim
in
a
number
of
wars
frederick
conquered
all
of
silesia
and
although
he
was
often
very
near
defeat
he
maintained
himself
in
his
newly
acquired
territories
against
all
austrian
europe
took
due
notice
of
this
sudden
appearance
of
a
very
powerful
new
state
in
the
eighteenth
century
the
germans
were
a
people
who
had
been
ruined
by
the
great
religious
wars
and
who
were
not
held
in
high
esteem
by
any
one
frederick
by
an
effort
as
sudden
and
quite
as
terrific
as
that
of
peter
of
russia
changed
this
attitude
of
contempt
into
one
of
fear
the
internal
affairs
of
prussia
were
arranged
so
skillfully
that
the
subjects
had
less
reason
for
complaint
than
elsewhere
the
treasury
showed
an
annual
surplus
instead
of
a
deficit
torture
was
abolished
the
judiciary
system
was
improved
good
roads
and
good
schools
and
good
universities
together
with
a
scrupulously
honest
administration
made
the
people
feel
that
whatever
services
were
demanded
of
them
they
to
speak
the
vernacular
got
their
money
worth
after
having
been
for
several
centuries
the
battle
field
of
the
french
and
the
austrians
and
the
swedes
and
the
danes
and
the
poles
germany
encouraged
by
the
example
of
prussia
began
to
regain
and
this
was
the
work
of
the
little
old
man
with
his
and
his
old
uniforms
covered
with
snuff
who
said
very
funny
but
very
unpleasant
things
about
his
neighbours
and
who
played
the
scandalous
game
of
eighteenth
century
diplomacy
without
any
regard
for
the
truth
provided
he
could
gain
something
by
his
lies
this
in
spite
of
his
book
in
the
year
the
end
came
his
friends
were
all
gone
children
he
had
never
had
he
died
alone
tended
by
a
single
servant
and
his
faithful
dogs
whom
he
loved
better
than
human
beings
because
as
he
said
they
were
never
ungrateful
and
remained
true
to
their
friends
the
mercantile
system
how
the
newly
founded
national
or
dynastic
states
of
europe
tried
to
make
themselves
rich
and
what
was
meant
by
the
mercantile
system
we
have
seen
how
during
the
sixteenth
and
the
seventeenth
centuries
the
states
of
our
modern
world
began
to
take
shape
their
origins
were
different
in
almost
every
case
some
had
been
the
result
of
the
deliberate
effort
of
a
single
king
others
had
happened
by
chance
still
others
had
been
the
result
of
favourable
natural
geographic
boundaries
but
once
they
had
been
founded
they
had
all
of
them
tried
to
strengthen
their
internal
administration
and
to
exert
the
greatest
possible
influence
upon
foreign
affairs
all
this
of
course
had
cost
a
great
deal
of
money
the
mediaeval
state
with
its
lack
of
centralised
power
did
not
depend
upon
a
rich
treasury
the
king
got
his
revenues
from
the
crown
domains
and
his
civil
service
paid
for
itself
the
modern
centralised
state
was
a
more
complicated
affair
the
old
knights
disappeared
and
hired
government
officials
or
bureaucrats
took
their
place
army
navy
and
internal
administration
demanded
millions
the
question
then
became
where
was
this
money
to
be
found
gold
and
silver
had
been
a
rare
commodity
in
the
middle
ages
the
average
man
as
i
have
told
you
never
saw
a
gold
piece
as
long
as
he
lived
only
the
inhabitants
of
the
large
cities
were
familiar
with
silver
coin
the
discovery
of
america
and
the
exploitation
of
the
peruvian
mines
changed
all
this
the
centre
of
trade
was
transferred
from
the
mediterranean
to
the
atlantic
seaboard
the
old
commercial
cities
of
italy
lost
their
financial
importance
new
commercial
nations
took
their
place
and
gold
and
silver
were
no
longer
a
curiosity
through
spain
and
portugal
and
holland
and
england
precious
metals
began
to
find
their
way
to
europe
the
sixteenth
century
had
its
own
writers
on
the
subject
of
political
economy
and
they
evolved
a
theory
of
national
wealth
which
seemed
to
them
entirely
sound
and
of
the
greatest
possible
benefit
to
their
respective
countries
they
reasoned
that
both
gold
and
silver
were
actual
wealth
therefore
they
believed
that
the
country
with
the
largest
supply
of
actual
cash
in
the
vaults
of
its
treasury
and
its
banks
was
at
the
same
time
the
richest
country
and
since
money
meant
armies
it
followed
that
the
richest
country
was
also
the
most
powerful
and
could
rule
the
rest
of
the
world
we
call
this
system
the
mercantile
system
and
it
was
accepted
with
the
same
unquestioning
faith
with
which
the
early
christians
believed
in
miracles
and
many
of
the
american
business
men
believe
in
the
tariff
in
practice
the
mercantile
system
worked
out
as
follows
to
get
the
largest
surplus
of
precious
metals
a
country
must
have
a
favourable
balance
of
export
trade
if
you
can
export
more
to
your
neighbour
than
he
exports
to
your
own
country
he
will
owe
you
money
and
will
be
obliged
to
send
you
some
of
his
gold
hence
you
gain
and
he
loses
as
a
result
of
this
creed
the
economic
program
of
almost
every
seventeenth
century
state
was
as
follows
try
to
get
possession
of
as
many
precious
metals
as
you
can
encourage
foreign
trade
in
preference
to
domestic
trade
encourage
those
industries
which
change
raw
materials
into
exportable
finished
products
encourage
a
large
population
for
you
will
need
workmen
for
your
factories
and
an
agricultural
community
does
not
raise
enough
workmen
let
the
state
watch
this
process
and
interfere
whenever
it
is
necessary
to
do
so
instead
of
regarding
international
trade
as
something
akin
to
a
force
of
nature
which
would
always
obey
certain
natural
laws
regardless
of
interference
the
people
of
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
tried
to
regulate
their
commerce
by
the
help
of
official
decrees
and
royal
laws
and
financial
help
on
the
part
of
the
government
in
the
sixteenth
century
charles
v
adopted
this
mercantile
system
which
was
then
something
entirely
new
and
introduced
it
into
his
many
possessions
elizabeth
of
england
flattered
him
by
her
imitation
the
bourbons
especially
king
louis
xiv
were
fanatical
adherents
of
this
doctrine
and
colbert
his
great
minister
of
finance
became
the
prophet
of
mercantilism
to
whom
all
europe
looked
for
guidance
the
entire
foreign
policy
of
cromwell
was
a
practical
application
of
the
mercantile
system
it
was
invariably
directed
against
the
rich
rival
republic
of
holland
for
the
dutch
shippers
as
the
of
the
merchandise
of
europe
had
certain
leanings
towards
and
therefore
had
to
be
destroyed
at
all
cost
it
will
be
easily
understood
how
such
a
system
must
affect
the
colonies
a
colony
under
the
mercantile
system
became
merely
a
reservoir
of
gold
and
silver
and
spices
which
was
to
be
tapped
for
the
benefit
of
the
home
country
the
asiatic
american
and
african
supply
of
precious
metals
and
the
raw
materials
of
these
tropical
countries
became
a
monopoly
of
the
state
which
happened
to
own
that
particular
colony
no
outsider
was
ever
allowed
within
the
precincts
and
no
native
was
permitted
to
trade
with
a
merchant
whose
ship
flew
a
foreign
flag
undoubtedly
the
mercantile
system
encouraged
the
development
of
young
industries
in
certain
countries
where
there
never
had
been
any
manufacturing
before
it
built
roads
and
dug
canals
and
made
for
better
means
of
transportation
it
demanded
greater
skill
among
the
workmen
and
gave
the
merchant
a
better
social
position
while
it
weakened
the
power
of
the
landed
aristocracy
on
the
other
hand
it
caused
very
great
misery
it
made
the
natives
in
the
colonies
the
victims
of
a
most
shameless
exploitation
it
exposed
the
citizens
of
the
home
country
to
an
even
more
terrible
fate
it
helped
in
a
great
measure
to
turn
every
land
into
an
armed
camp
and
divided
the
world
into
little
bits
of
territory
each
working
for
its
own
direct
benefit
while
striving
at
all
times
to
destroy
the
power
of
its
neighbours
and
get
hold
of
their
treasures
it
laid
so
much
stress
upon
the
importance
of
owning
wealth
that
being
rich
came
to
be
regarded
as
the
sole
virtue
of
the
average
citizen
economic
systems
come
and
go
like
the
fashions
in
surgery
and
in
the
clothes
of
women
and
during
the
nineteenth
century
the
mercantile
system
was
discarded
in
favor
of
a
system
of
free
and
open
competition
at
least
so
i
have
been
told
the
american
revolution
at
the
end
of
the
eighteenth
century
europe
heard
strange
reports
of
something
which
had
happened
in
the
wilderness
of
the
north
american
continent
the
descendants
of
the
men
who
had
punished
king
charles
for
his
insistence
upon
his
divine
rights
added
a
new
chapter
to
the
old
story
of
the
struggle
for
for
the
sake
of
convenience
we
ought
to
go
back
a
few
centuries
and
repeat
the
early
history
of
the
great
struggle
for
colonial
possessions
as
soon
as
a
number
of
european
nations
had
been
created
upon
the
new
basis
of
national
or
dynastic
interests
that
is
to
say
during
and
immediately
after
the
thirty
years
war
their
rulers
backed
up
by
the
capital
of
their
merchants
and
the
ships
of
their
trading
companies
continued
the
fight
for
more
territory
in
asia
africa
and
america
the
spaniards
and
the
portuguese
had
been
exploring
the
indian
sea
and
the
pacific
ocean
for
more
than
a
century
ere
holland
and
england
appeared
upon
the
stage
this
proved
an
advantage
to
the
latter
the
first
rough
work
had
already
been
done
what
is
more
the
earliest
navigators
had
so
often
made
themselves
unpopular
with
the
asiatic
and
american
and
african
natives
that
both
the
english
and
the
dutch
were
welcomed
as
friends
and
deliverers
we
can
not
claim
any
superior
virtues
for
either
of
these
two
races
but
they
were
merchants
before
everything
else
they
never
allowed
religious
considerations
to
interfere
with
their
practical
common
sense
during
their
first
relations
with
weaker
races
all
european
nations
have
behaved
with
shocking
brutality
the
english
and
the
dutch
however
knew
better
where
to
draw
the
dine
provided
they
got
their
spices
and
their
gold
and
silver
and
their
taxes
they
were
willing
to
let
the
native
live
as
it
best
pleased
him
it
was
not
very
difficult
for
them
therefore
to
establish
themselves
in
the
richest
parts
of
the
world
but
as
soon
as
this
had
been
accomplished
they
began
to
fight
each
other
for
still
further
possessions
strangely
enough
the
colonial
wars
were
never
settled
in
the
colonies
themselves
they
were
decided
three
thousand
miles
away
by
the
navies
of
the
contending
countries
it
is
one
of
the
most
interesting
principles
of
ancient
and
modern
warfare
one
of
the
few
reliable
laws
of
history
that
the
nation
which
commands
the
sea
is
also
the
nation
which
commands
the
land
so
far
this
law
has
never
failed
to
work
but
the
modern
airplane
may
have
changed
it
in
the
eighteenth
century
however
there
were
no
flying
machines
and
it
was
the
british
navy
which
gained
for
england
her
vast
american
and
indian
and
african
colonies
the
series
of
naval
wars
between
england
and
holland
in
the
seventeenth
century
does
not
interest
us
here
it
ended
as
all
such
encounters
between
hopelessly
powers
will
end
but
the
warfare
between
england
and
france
her
other
rival
is
of
greater
importance
to
us
for
while
the
superior
british
fleet
in
the
end
defeated
the
french
navy
a
great
deal
of
the
preliminary
fighting
was
done
on
our
own
american
continent
in
this
vast
country
both
france
and
england
claimed
everything
which
had
been
discovered
and
a
lot
more
which
the
eye
of
no
white
man
had
ever
seen
in
cabot
had
landed
in
the
northern
part
of
america
and
years
later
giovanni
verrazano
had
visited
these
coasts
cabot
had
flown
the
english
flag
verrazano
had
sailed
under
the
french
flag
hence
both
england
and
france
proclaimed
themselves
the
owners
of
the
entire
continent
during
the
seventeenth
century
some
ten
small
english
colonies
had
been
founded
between
maine
and
the
carolinas
they
were
usually
a
haven
of
refuge
for
some
particular
sect
of
english
dissenters
such
as
the
puritans
who
in
the
year
went
to
new
england
or
the
quakers
who
settled
in
pennsylvania
in
they
were
small
frontier
communities
nestling
close
to
the
shores
of
the
ocean
where
people
had
gathered
to
make
a
new
home
and
begin
life
among
happier
surroundings
far
away
from
royal
supervision
and
interference
the
french
colonies
on
the
other
hand
always
remained
a
possession
of
the
crown
no
huguenots
or
protestants
were
allowed
in
these
colonies
for
fear
that
they
might
contaminate
the
indians
with
their
dangerous
protestant
doctrines
and
would
perhaps
interfere
with
the
missionary
work
of
the
jesuit
fathers
the
english
colonies
therefore
had
been
founded
upon
a
much
healthier
basis
than
their
french
neighbours
and
rivals
they
were
an
expression
of
the
commercial
energy
of
the
english
middle
classes
while
the
french
settlements
were
inhabited
by
people
who
had
crossed
the
ocean
as
servants
of
the
king
and
who
expected
to
return
to
paris
at
the
first
possible
chance
politically
however
the
position
of
the
english
colonies
was
far
from
satisfactory
the
french
had
discovered
the
mouth
of
the
saint
lawrence
in
the
sixteenth
century
from
the
region
of
the
great
lakes
they
had
worked
their
way
southward
had
descended
the
mississippi
and
had
built
several
fortifications
along
the
gulf
of
mexico
after
a
century
of
exploration
a
line
of
sixty
french
forts
cut
off
the
english
settlements
along
the
atlantic
seaboard
from
the
interior
the
english
land
grants
made
to
the
different
colonial
companies
had
given
them
all
land
from
sea
to
sea
this
sounded
well
on
paper
but
in
practice
british
territory
ended
where
the
line
of
french
fortifications
began
to
break
through
this
barrier
was
possible
but
it
took
both
men
and
money
and
caused
a
series
of
horrible
border
wars
in
which
both
sides
murdered
their
white
neighbours
with
the
help
of
the
indian
tribes
as
long
as
the
stuarts
had
ruled
england
there
had
been
no
danger
of
war
with
france
the
stuarts
needed
the
bourbons
in
their
attempt
to
establish
an
autocratic
form
of
government
and
to
break
the
power
of
parliament
but
in
the
last
of
the
stuarts
had
disappeared
from
british
soil
and
dutch
william
the
great
enemy
of
louis
xiv
succeeded
him
from
that
time
on
until
the
treaty
of
paris
of
france
and
england
fought
for
the
possession
of
india
and
north
america
during
these
wars
as
i
have
said
before
the
english
navies
invariably
beat
the
french
cut
off
from
her
colonies
france
lost
most
of
her
possessions
and
when
peace
was
declared
the
entire
north
american
continent
had
fallen
into
british
hands
and
the
great
work
of
exploration
of
cartier
champlain
la
salle
marquette
and
a
score
of
others
was
lost
to
france
only
a
very
small
part
of
this
vast
domain
was
inhabited
from
massachusetts
in
the
north
where
the
pilgrims
a
sect
of
puritans
who
were
very
intolerant
and
who
therefore
had
found
no
happiness
either
in
anglican
england
or
calvinist
holland
had
landed
in
the
year
to
the
carolinas
and
virginia
the
provinces
which
had
been
founded
entirely
for
the
sake
of
profit
stretched
a
thin
line
of
sparsely
populated
territory
but
the
men
who
lived
in
this
new
land
of
fresh
air
and
high
skies
were
very
different
from
their
brethren
of
the
mother
country
in
the
wilderness
they
had
learned
independence
and
they
were
the
sons
of
hardy
and
energetic
ancestors
lazy
and
timourous
people
did
not
cross
the
ocean
in
those
days
the
american
colonists
hated
the
restraint
and
the
lack
of
breathing
space
which
had
made
their
lives
in
the
old
country
so
very
unhappy
they
meant
to
be
their
own
masters
this
the
ruling
classes
of
england
did
not
seem
to
understand
the
government
annoyed
the
colonists
and
the
colonists
who
hated
to
be
bothered
in
this
way
began
to
annoy
the
british
government
bad
feeling
caused
more
bad
feeling
it
is
not
necessary
to
repeat
here
in
detail
what
actually
happened
and
what
might
have
been
avoided
if
the
british
king
had
been
more
intelligent
than
george
iii
or
less
given
to
drowsiness
and
indifference
than
his
minister
lord
north
the
british
colonists
when
they
understood
that
peaceful
arguments
would
not
settle
the
difficulties
took
to
arms
from
being
loyal
subjects
they
turned
rebels
who
exposed
themselves
to
the
punishment
of
death
when
they
were
captured
by
the
german
soldiers
whom
george
hired
to
do
his
fighting
after
the
pleasant
custom
of
that
day
when
teutonic
princes
sold
whole
regiments
to
the
highest
bidder
the
war
between
england
and
her
american
colonies
lasted
seven
years
during
most
of
that
time
the
final
success
of
the
rebels
seemed
very
doubtful
a
great
number
of
the
people
especially
in
the
cities
had
remained
loyal
to
their
king
they
were
in
favour
of
a
compromise
and
would
have
been
willing
to
sue
for
peace
but
the
great
figure
of
washington
stood
guard
over
the
cause
of
the
colonists
ably
assisted
by
a
handful
of
brave
men
he
used
his
steadfast
but
badly
equipped
armies
to
weaken
the
forces
of
the
king
time
and
again
when
defeat
seemed
unavoidable
his
strategy
turned
the
tide
of
battle
often
his
men
were
during
the
winter
they
lacked
shoes
and
coats
and
were
forced
to
live
in
unhealthy
but
their
trust
in
their
great
leader
was
absolute
and
they
stuck
it
out
until
the
final
hour
of
victory
but
more
interesting
than
the
campaigns
of
washington
or
the
diplomatic
triumphs
of
benjamin
franklin
who
was
in
europe
getting
money
from
the
french
government
and
the
amsterdam
bankers
was
an
event
which
occurred
early
in
the
revolution
the
representatives
of
the
different
colonies
had
gathered
in
philadelphia
to
discuss
matters
of
common
importance
it
was
the
first
year
of
the
revolution
most
of
the
big
towns
of
the
sea
coast
were
still
in
the
hands
of
the
british
reinforcements
from
england
were
arriving
by
the
ship
load
only
men
who
were
deeply
convinced
of
the
righteousness
of
their
cause
would
have
found
the
courage
to
take
the
momentous
decision
of
the
months
of
june
and
july
of
the
year
in
june
richard
henry
lee
of
virginia
proposed
a
motion
to
the
continental
congress
that
these
united
colonies
are
and
of
right
ought
to
be
free
and
independent
states
that
they
are
absolved
from
all
allegiance
to
the
british
crown
and
that
all
political
connection
between
them
and
the
state
of
great
britain
is
and
ought
to
be
totally
dissolved
the
motion
was
seconded
by
john
adams
of
massachusetts
it
was
carried
on
july
the
second
and
on
july
fourth
it
was
followed
by
an
official
declaration
of
independence
which
was
the
work
of
thomas
jefferson
a
serious
and
exceedingly
capable
student
of
both
politics
and
government
and
destined
to
be
one
of
the
most
famous
of
out
american
presidents
when
news
of
this
event
reached
europe
and
was
followed
by
the
final
victory
of
the
colonists
and
the
adoption
of
the
famous
constitution
of
the
year
the
first
of
all
written
constitutions
it
caused
great
interest
the
dynastic
system
of
the
highly
centralised
states
which
had
been
developed
after
the
great
religious
wars
of
the
seventeenth
century
had
reached
the
height
of
its
power
everywhere
the
palace
of
the
king
had
grown
to
enormous
proportions
while
the
cities
of
the
royal
realm
were
being
surrounded
by
rapidly
growing
acres
of
slums
the
inhabitants
of
those
slums
were
showing
signs
of
restlessness
they
were
quite
helpless
but
the
higher
classes
the
nobles
and
the
professional
men
they
too
were
beginning
to
have
certain
doubts
about
the
economic
and
political
conditions
under
which
they
lived
the
success
of
the
american
colonists
showed
them
that
many
things
were
possible
which
had
been
held
impossible
only
a
short
time
before
according
to
the
poet
the
shot
which
opened
the
battle
of
lexington
was
heard
around
the
world
that
was
a
bit
of
an
exaggeration
the
chinese
and
the
japanese
and
the
russians
not
to
speak
of
the
australians
who
had
just
been
by
captain
cook
whom
they
killed
for
his
trouble
never
heard
of
it
at
all
but
it
carried
across
the
atlantic
ocean
it
landed
in
the
powder
house
of
european
discontent
and
in
france
it
caused
an
explosion
which
rocked
the
entire
continent
from
petrograd
to
madrid
and
buried
the
representatives
of
the
old
statecraft
and
the
old
diplomacy
under
several
tons
of
democratic
bricks
the
french
revolution
the
great
french
revolution
proclaims
the
principles
of
liberty
fraternity
and
equality
unto
all
the
people
of
the
earth
before
we
talk
about
a
revolution
it
is
just
as
well
that
we
explain
just
what
this
word
means
in
the
terms
of
a
great
russian
writer
and
russians
ought
to
know
what
they
are
talking
about
in
this
field
a
revolution
is
a
swift
overthrow
in
a
few
years
of
institutions
which
have
taken
centuries
to
root
in
the
soil
and
seem
so
fixed
and
immovable
that
even
the
most
ardent
reformers
hardly
dare
to
attack
them
in
their
writings
it
is
the
fall
the
crumbling
away
in
a
brief
period
of
all
that
up
to
that
time
has
composed
the
essence
of
social
religious
political
and
economic
life
in
a
nation
such
a
revolution
took
place
in
france
in
the
eighteenth
century
when
the
old
civilisation
of
the
country
had
grown
stale
the
king
in
the
days
of
louis
xiv
had
become
everything
and
was
the
state
the
nobility
formerly
the
civil
servant
of
the
federal
state
found
itself
without
any
duties
and
became
a
social
ornament
of
the
royal
court
this
french
state
of
the
eighteenth
century
however
cost
incredible
sums
of
money
this
money
had
to
be
produced
in
the
form
of
taxes
unfortunately
the
kings
of
france
had
not
been
strong
enough
to
force
the
nobility
and
the
clergy
to
pay
their
share
of
these
taxes
hence
the
taxes
were
paid
entirely
by
the
agricultural
population
but
the
peasants
living
in
dreary
hovels
no
longer
in
intimate
contact
with
their
former
landlords
but
victims
of
cruel
and
incompetent
land
agents
were
going
from
bad
to
worse
why
should
they
work
and
exert
themselves
increased
returns
upon
their
land
merely
meant
more
taxes
and
nothing
for
themselves
and
therefore
they
neglected
their
fields
as
much
as
they
dared
hence
we
have
a
king
who
wanders
in
empty
splendour
through
the
vast
halls
of
his
palaces
habitually
followed
by
hungry
office
seekers
all
of
whom
live
upon
the
revenue
obtained
from
peasants
who
are
no
better
than
the
beasts
of
the
fields
it
is
not
a
pleasant
picture
but
it
is
not
exaggerated
there
was
however
another
side
to
the
ancien
regime
which
we
must
keep
in
mind
a
wealthy
middle
class
closely
connected
with
the
nobility
by
the
usual
process
of
the
rich
banker
daughter
marrying
the
poor
son
and
a
court
composed
of
all
the
most
entertaining
people
of
france
had
brought
the
polite
art
of
graceful
living
to
its
highest
development
as
the
best
brains
of
the
country
were
not
allowed
to
occupy
themselves
with
questions
of
political
economics
they
spent
their
idle
hours
upon
the
discussion
of
abstract
ideas
as
fashions
in
modes
of
thought
and
personal
behaviour
are
quite
as
likely
to
run
to
extremes
as
fashion
in
dress
it
was
natural
that
the
most
artificial
society
of
that
day
should
take
a
tremendous
interest
in
what
they
considered
the
simple
life
the
king
and
the
queen
the
absolute
and
unquestioned
proprietors
of
this
country
galled
france
together
with
all
its
colonies
and
dependencies
went
to
live
in
funny
little
country
houses
all
dressed
up
as
and
and
played
at
being
shepherds
in
a
happy
vale
of
ancient
hellas
around
them
their
courtiers
danced
attendance
their
composed
lovely
minuets
their
court
barbers
devised
more
and
more
elaborate
and
costly
headgear
until
from
sheer
boredom
and
lack
of
real
jobs
this
whole
artificial
world
of
versailles
the
great
show
place
which
louis
xiv
had
built
far
away
from
his
noisy
and
restless
city
talked
of
nothing
but
those
subjects
which
were
furthest
removed
from
their
own
lives
just
as
a
man
who
is
starving
will
talk
of
nothing
except
food
when
voltaire
the
courageous
old
philosopher
playwright
historian
and
novelist
and
the
great
enemy
of
all
religious
and
political
tyranny
began
to
throw
his
bombs
of
criticism
at
everything
connected
with
the
established
order
of
things
the
whole
french
world
applauded
him
and
his
theatrical
pieces
played
to
standing
room
only
when
jean
jacques
rousseau
waxed
sentimental
about
primitive
man
and
gave
his
contemporaries
delightful
descriptions
of
the
happiness
of
the
original
inhabitants
of
this
planet
about
whom
he
knew
as
little
as
he
did
about
the
children
upon
whose
education
he
was
the
recognised
authority
all
france
read
his
social
contract
and
this
society
in
which
the
king
and
the
state
were
one
wept
bitter
tears
when
they
heard
rousseau
appeal
for
a
return
to
the
blessed
days
when
the
real
sovereignty
had
lain
in
the
hands
of
the
people
and
when
the
king
had
been
merely
the
servant
of
his
people
when
montesquieu
published
his
persian
letters
in
which
two
distinguished
persian
travellers
turn
the
whole
existing
society
of
france
and
poke
fun
at
everything
from
the
king
down
to
the
lowest
of
his
six
hundred
pastry
cooks
the
book
immediately
went
through
four
editions
and
assured
the
writer
thousands
of
readers
for
his
famous
discussion
of
the
spirit
of
the
laws
in
which
the
noble
baron
compared
the
excellent
english
system
with
the
backward
system
of
france
and
advocated
instead
of
an
absolute
monarchy
the
establishment
of
a
state
in
which
the
executive
the
legislative
and
the
judicial
powers
should
be
in
separate
hands
and
should
work
independently
of
each
other
when
lebreton
the
parisian
announced
that
messieurs
diderot
turgot
and
a
score
of
other
distinguished
writers
were
going
to
publish
an
encyclopaedia
which
was
to
contain
all
the
new
ideas
and
the
new
science
and
the
new
knowledge
the
response
from
the
side
of
the
public
was
most
satisfactory
and
when
after
years
the
last
of
the
volumes
had
been
finished
the
somewhat
belated
interference
of
the
police
could
not
repress
the
enthusiasm
with
which
french
society
received
this
most
important
but
very
dangerous
contribution
to
the
discussions
of
the
day
here
let
me
give
you
a
little
warning
when
you
read
a
novel
about
the
french
revolution
or
see
a
play
or
a
movie
you
will
easily
get
the
impression
that
the
revolution
was
the
work
of
the
rabble
from
the
paris
slums
it
was
nothing
of
the
kind
the
mob
appears
often
upon
the
revolutionary
stage
but
invariably
at
the
instigation
and
under
the
leadership
of
those
professional
men
who
used
the
hungry
multitude
as
an
efficient
ally
in
their
warfare
upon
the
king
and
his
court
but
the
fundamental
ideas
which
caused
the
revolution
were
invented
by
a
few
brilliant
minds
and
they
were
at
first
introduced
into
the
charming
of
the
ancien
regime
to
provide
amiable
diversion
for
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
his
majesty
court
these
pleasant
but
careless
people
played
with
the
dangerous
fireworks
of
social
criticism
until
the
sparks
fell
through
the
cracks
of
the
floor
which
was
old
and
rotten
just
like
the
rest
of
the
building
those
sparks
unfortunately
landed
in
the
basement
where
rubbish
lay
in
great
confusion
then
there
was
a
cry
of
fire
but
the
owner
of
the
house
who
was
interested
in
everything
except
the
management
of
his
property
did
not
know
how
to
put
the
small
blaze
out
the
flame
spread
rapidly
and
the
entire
edifice
was
consumed
by
the
conflagration
which
we
call
the
great
french
revolution
for
the
sake
of
convenience
we
can
divide
the
french
revolution
into
two
parts
from
to
there
was
a
more
or
less
orderly
attempt
to
introduce
a
constitutional
monarchy
this
failed
partly
through
lack
of
good
faith
and
stupidity
on
the
part
of
the
monarch
himself
partly
through
circumstances
over
which
nobody
had
any
control
from
to
there
was
a
republic
and
a
first
effort
to
establish
a
democratic
form
of
government
but
the
actual
outbreak
of
violence
had
been
preceded
by
many
years
of
unrest
and
many
sincere
but
ineffectual
attempts
at
reform
when
france
had
a
debt
of
million
francs
and
the
treasury
was
always
empty
and
there
was
not
a
single
thing
upon
which
new
taxes
could
be
levied
even
good
king
louis
who
was
an
expert
locksmith
and
a
great
hunter
but
a
very
poor
statesman
felt
vaguely
that
something
ought
to
be
done
therefore
he
called
for
turgot
to
be
his
minister
of
finance
anne
robert
jacques
turgot
baron
de
a
man
in
the
early
sixties
a
splendid
representative
of
the
fast
disappearing
class
of
landed
gentry
had
been
a
successful
governor
of
a
province
and
was
an
amateur
political
economist
of
great
ability
he
did
his
best
unfortunately
he
could
not
perform
miracles
as
it
was
impossible
to
squeeze
more
taxes
out
of
the
ragged
peasants
it
was
necessary
to
get
the
necessary
funds
from
the
nobility
and
clergy
who
had
never
paid
a
centime
this
made
turgot
the
best
hated
man
at
the
court
of
versailles
furthermore
he
was
obliged
to
face
the
enmity
of
marie
antoinette
the
queen
who
was
against
everybody
who
dared
to
mention
the
word
economy
within
her
hearing
soon
turgot
was
called
an
unpractical
visionary
and
a
and
then
of
course
his
position
became
untenable
in
the
year
he
was
forced
to
resign
after
the
professor
there
came
a
man
of
practical
business
sense
he
was
an
industrious
swiss
by
the
name
of
necker
who
had
made
himself
rich
as
a
grain
speculator
and
the
partner
in
an
international
banking
house
his
ambitious
wife
had
pushed
him
into
the
government
service
that
she
might
establish
a
position
for
her
daughter
who
afterwards
as
the
wife
of
the
swedish
minister
in
paris
baron
de
stael
became
a
famous
literary
figure
of
the
early
nineteenth
century
necker
set
to
work
with
a
fine
display
of
zeal
just
as
turgot
had
done
in
he
published
a
careful
review
of
the
french
finances
the
king
understood
nothing
of
this
compte
rendu
he
had
just
sent
troops
to
america
to
help
the
colonists
against
their
common
enemies
the
english
this
expedition
proved
to
be
unexpectedly
expensive
and
necker
was
asked
to
find
the
necessary
funds
when
instead
of
producing
revenue
he
published
more
figures
and
made
statistics
and
began
to
use
the
dreary
warning
about
necessary
economies
his
days
were
numbered
in
the
year
he
was
dismissed
as
an
incompetent
servant
after
the
professor
and
the
practical
business
man
came
the
delightful
type
of
financier
who
will
guarantee
everybody
per
cent
per
month
on
their
money
if
only
they
will
trust
his
own
infallible
system
he
was
charles
alexandre
de
calonne
a
pushing
official
who
had
made
his
career
both
by
his
industry
and
his
complete
lack
of
honesty
and
scruples
he
found
the
country
heavily
indebted
but
he
was
a
clever
man
willing
to
oblige
everybody
and
he
invented
a
quick
remedy
he
paid
the
old
debts
by
contracting
new
ones
this
method
is
not
new
the
result
since
time
immemorial
has
been
disastrous
in
less
than
three
years
more
than
francs
had
been
added
to
the
french
debt
by
this
charming
minister
of
finance
who
never
worried
and
smilingly
signed
his
name
to
every
demand
that
was
made
by
his
majesty
and
by
his
lovely
queen
who
had
learned
the
habit
of
spending
during
the
days
of
her
youth
in
vienna
at
last
even
the
parliament
of
paris
a
high
court
of
justice
and
not
a
legislative
body
although
by
no
means
lacking
in
loyalty
to
their
sovereign
decided
that
something
must
be
done
calonne
wanted
to
borrow
another
francs
it
had
been
a
bad
year
for
the
crops
and
the
misery
and
hunger
in
the
country
districts
were
terrible
unless
something
sensible
were
done
france
would
go
bankrupt
the
king
as
always
was
unaware
of
the
seriousness
of
the
situation
would
it
not
be
a
good
idea
to
consult
the
representatives
of
the
people
since
no
estates
general
had
been
called
together
in
view
of
the
threatening
panic
there
was
a
demand
that
the
estates
be
convened
louis
xvi
however
who
never
could
take
a
decision
refused
to
go
as
far
as
that
to
pacify
the
popular
clamour
he
called
together
a
meeting
of
the
notables
in
the
year
this
merely
meant
a
gathering
of
the
best
families
who
discussed
what
could
and
should
be
done
without
touching
their
feudal
and
clerical
privilege
of
it
is
unreasonable
to
expect
that
a
certain
class
of
society
shall
commit
political
and
economic
suicide
for
the
benefit
of
another
group
of
the
notables
obstinately
refused
to
surrender
a
single
one
of
their
ancient
rights
the
crowd
in
the
street
being
now
exceedingly
hungry
demanded
that
necker
in
whom
they
had
confidence
be
reappointed
the
notables
said
no
the
crowd
in
the
street
began
to
smash
windows
and
do
other
unseemly
things
the
notables
fled
calonne
was
dismissed
a
new
colourless
minister
of
finance
the
cardinal
lomenie
de
brienne
was
appointed
and
louis
driven
by
the
violent
threats
of
his
starving
subjects
agreed
to
call
together
the
old
estates
general
as
soon
as
practicable
this
vague
promise
of
course
satisfied
no
one
no
such
severe
winter
had
been
experienced
for
almost
a
century
the
crops
had
been
either
destroyed
by
floods
or
had
been
frozen
to
death
in
the
fields
all
the
olive
trees
of
the
provence
had
been
killed
private
charity
tried
to
do
but
could
accomplish
little
for
eighteen
million
starving
people
everywhere
bread
riots
occurred
a
generation
before
these
would
have
been
put
down
by
the
army
but
the
work
of
the
new
philosophical
school
had
begun
to
bear
fruit
people
began
to
understand
that
a
shotgun
is
no
effective
remedy
for
a
hungry
stomach
and
even
the
soldiers
who
came
from
among
the
people
were
no
longer
to
be
depended
upon
it
was
absolutely
necessary
that
the
king
should
do
something
definite
to
regain
the
popular
goodwill
but
again
he
hesitated
here
and
there
in
the
provinces
little
independent
republics
were
established
by
followers
of
the
new
school
the
cry
of
no
taxation
without
representation
the
slogan
of
the
american
rebels
a
quarter
of
a
century
before
was
heard
among
the
faithful
middle
classes
france
was
threatened
with
general
anarchy
to
appease
the
people
and
to
increase
the
royal
popularity
the
government
unexpectedly
suspended
the
former
very
strict
form
of
censorship
of
books
at
once
a
flood
of
ink
descended
upon
france
everybody
high
or
low
criticised
and
was
criticised
more
than
pamphlets
were
published
lomenie
de
brienne
was
swept
away
by
a
storm
of
abuse
necker
was
hastily
called
back
to
placate
as
best
he
could
the
unrest
immediately
the
stock
market
went
up
thirty
per
cent
and
by
common
consent
people
suspended
judgment
for
a
little
while
longer
in
may
of
the
estates
general
were
to
assemble
and
then
the
wisdom
of
the
entire
nation
would
speedily
solve
the
difficult
problem
of
recreating
the
kingdom
of
france
into
a
healthy
and
happy
state
this
prevailing
idea
that
the
combined
wisdom
of
the
people
would
be
able
to
solve
all
difficulties
proved
disastrous
it
lamed
all
personal
effort
during
many
important
months
instead
of
keeping
the
government
in
his
own
hands
at
this
critical
moment
necker
allowed
everything
to
drift
hence
there
was
a
new
outbreak
of
the
acrimonious
debate
upon
the
best
ways
to
reform
the
old
kingdom
everywhere
the
power
of
the
police
weakened
the
people
of
the
paris
suburbs
under
the
leadership
of
professional
agitators
gradually
began
to
discover
their
strength
and
commenced
to
play
the
role
which
was
to
be
theirs
all
through
the
years
of
the
great
unrest
when
they
acted
as
the
brute
force
which
was
used
by
the
actual
leaders
of
the
revolution
to
secure
those
things
which
could
not
be
obtained
in
a
legitimate
fashion
as
a
sop
to
the
peasants
and
the
middle
class
necker
that
they
should
be
allowed
a
double
representation
in
the
estates
general
upon
this
subject
the
abbe
sieyes
then
wrote
a
famous
pamphlet
to
what
does
the
third
estate
amount
in
which
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
third
estate
a
name
given
to
the
middle
class
ought
to
amount
to
everything
that
it
had
not
amounted
to
anything
in
the
past
and
that
it
now
desired
to
amount
to
something
he
expressed
the
sentiment
of
the
great
majority
of
the
people
who
had
the
best
interests
of
the
country
at
heart
finally
the
elections
took
place
under
the
worst
conditions
imaginable
when
they
were
over
clergymen
noblemen
and
representatives
of
the
third
estate
packed
their
trunks
to
go
to
versailles
the
third
estate
was
obliged
to
carry
additional
luggage
this
consisted
of
voluminous
reports
called
cahiers
in
which
the
many
complaints
and
grievances
of
their
constituents
had
been
written
down
the
stage
was
set
for
the
great
final
act
that
was
to
save
france
the
estates
general
came
together
on
may
the
king
was
in
a
bad
humour
the
clergy
and
the
nobility
let
it
be
known
that
they
were
unwilling
to
give
up
a
single
one
of
their
privileges
the
king
ordered
the
three
groups
of
representatives
to
meet
in
different
rooms
and
discuss
their
grievances
separately
the
third
estate
refused
to
obey
the
royal
command
they
took
a
solemn
oath
to
that
effect
in
a
squash
court
hastily
put
in
order
for
the
purpose
of
this
illegal
meeting
on
the
of
june
they
insisted
that
all
three
estates
nobility
clergy
and
third
estate
should
meet
together
and
so
informed
his
majesty
the
king
gave
in
as
the
national
assembly
the
estates
general
began
to
discuss
the
state
of
the
french
kingdom
the
king
got
angry
then
again
he
hesitated
he
said
that
he
would
never
surrender
his
absolute
power
then
he
went
hunting
forgot
all
about
the
cares
of
the
state
and
when
he
returned
from
the
chase
he
gave
in
for
it
was
the
royal
habit
to
do
the
right
thing
at
the
wrong
time
in
the
wrong
way
when
the
people
clamoured
for
a
the
king
scolded
them
and
gave
them
nothing
then
when
the
palace
was
surrounded
by
a
howling
multitude
of
poor
people
the
king
surrendered
and
gave
his
subjects
what
they
had
asked
for
by
this
time
however
the
people
wanted
a
plus
b
the
comedy
was
repeated
when
the
king
signed
his
name
to
the
royal
decree
which
granted
his
beloved
subjects
a
and
b
they
were
threatening
to
kill
the
entire
royal
family
unless
they
received
a
plus
b
plus
and
so
on
through
the
whole
alphabet
and
up
to
the
scaffold
unfortunately
the
king
was
always
just
one
letter
behind
he
never
understood
this
even
when
he
laid
his
head
under
the
guillotine
he
felt
that
he
was
a
man
who
had
received
a
most
unwarrantable
treatment
at
the
hands
of
people
whom
he
had
loved
to
the
best
of
his
limited
ability
historical
ifs
as
i
have
often
warned
you
are
never
of
any
value
it
is
very
easy
for
us
to
say
that
the
monarchy
might
have
been
saved
if
louis
had
been
a
man
of
greater
energy
and
less
kindness
of
heart
but
the
king
was
not
alone
even
if
he
had
possessed
the
ruthless
strength
of
napoleon
his
career
during
these
difficult
days
might
have
been
easily
ruined
by
his
wife
who
was
the
daughter
of
maria
theresa
of
austria
and
who
possessed
all
the
characteristic
virtues
and
vices
of
a
young
girl
who
had
been
brought
up
at
the
most
autocratic
and
mediaeval
court
of
that
age
she
decided
that
some
action
must
be
taken
and
planned
a
necker
was
suddenly
dismissed
and
loyal
troops
were
called
to
paris
the
people
when
they
heard
of
this
stormed
the
fortress
of
the
bastille
prison
and
on
the
fourteenth
of
july
of
the
year
they
destroyed
this
familiar
but
symbol
of
autocratic
power
which
had
long
since
ceased
to
be
a
political
prison
and
was
now
used
as
the
city
for
pickpockets
and
men
many
of
the
nobles
took
the
hint
and
left
the
country
but
the
king
as
usual
did
nothing
he
had
been
hunting
on
the
day
of
the
fall
of
the
bastille
and
he
had
shot
several
deer
and
felt
very
much
pleased
the
national
assembly
now
set
to
work
and
on
the
of
august
with
the
noise
of
the
parisian
multitude
in
their
ears
they
abolished
all
privileges
this
was
followed
on
the
of
august
by
the
declaration
of
the
rights
of
man
the
famous
preamble
to
the
first
french
constitution
so
far
so
good
but
the
court
had
apparently
not
yet
learned
its
lesson
there
was
a
suspicion
that
the
king
was
again
trying
to
interfere
with
these
reforms
and
as
a
result
on
the
of
october
there
was
a
second
riot
in
paris
it
spread
to
versailles
and
the
people
were
not
pacified
until
they
had
brought
the
king
back
to
his
palace
in
paris
they
did
not
trust
him
in
versailles
they
liked
to
have
him
where
they
could
watch
him
and
control
his
correspondence
with
his
relatives
in
vienna
and
madrid
and
the
other
courts
of
europe
in
the
assembly
meanwhile
mirabeau
a
nobleman
who
had
become
leader
of
the
third
estate
was
beginning
to
put
order
into
chaos
but
before
he
could
save
the
position
of
the
king
he
died
on
the
of
april
of
the
year
the
king
who
now
began
to
fear
for
his
own
life
tried
to
escape
on
the
of
june
he
was
recognised
from
his
picture
on
a
coin
was
stopped
near
the
village
of
varennes
by
members
of
the
national
guard
and
was
brought
back
to
paris
in
september
of
the
first
constitution
of
france
was
accepted
and
the
members
of
the
national
assembly
went
home
on
the
first
of
october
of
the
legislative
assembly
came
together
to
continue
the
work
of
the
national
assembly
in
this
new
gathering
of
popular
representatives
there
were
many
extremely
revolutionary
elements
the
boldest
among
these
were
known
as
the
jacobins
after
the
old
jacobin
cloister
in
which
they
held
their
political
meetings
these
young
men
most
of
them
belonging
to
the
professional
classes
made
very
violent
speeches
and
when
the
newspapers
carried
these
orations
to
berlin
and
vienna
the
king
of
prussia
and
the
emperor
decided
that
they
must
do
something
to
save
their
good
brother
and
sister
they
were
very
busy
just
then
dividing
the
kingdom
of
poland
where
rival
political
factions
had
caused
such
a
state
of
disorder
that
the
country
was
at
the
mercy
of
anybody
who
wanted
to
take
a
couple
of
provinces
but
they
managed
to
send
an
army
to
invade
france
and
deliver
the
king
then
a
terrible
panic
of
fear
swept
throughout
the
land
of
france
all
the
hatred
of
years
of
hunger
and
suffering
came
to
a
horrible
climax
the
mob
of
paris
stormed
the
palace
of
the
tuilleries
the
faithful
swiss
bodyguards
tried
to
defend
their
master
but
louis
unable
to
make
up
his
mind
gave
order
to
cease
firing
just
when
the
crowd
was
retiring
the
people
drunk
with
blood
and
noise
and
cheap
wine
murdered
the
swiss
to
the
last
man
then
invaded
the
palace
and
went
after
louis
who
had
escaped
into
the
meeting
hall
of
the
assembly
where
he
was
immediately
suspended
of
his
office
and
from
where
he
was
taken
as
a
prisoner
to
the
old
castle
of
the
temple
but
the
armies
of
austria
and
prussia
continued
their
advance
and
the
panic
changed
into
hysteria
and
turned
men
and
women
into
wild
beasts
in
the
first
week
of
september
of
the
year
the
crowd
broke
into
the
jails
and
murdered
all
the
prisoners
the
government
did
not
interfere
the
jacobins
headed
by
danton
knew
that
this
crisis
meant
either
the
success
or
the
failure
of
the
revolution
and
that
only
the
most
brutal
audacity
could
save
them
the
legislative
assembly
was
closed
and
on
the
of
september
of
the
year
a
new
national
convention
came
together
it
was
a
body
composed
almost
entirely
of
extreme
revolutionists
the
king
was
formally
accused
of
high
treason
and
was
brought
before
the
convention
he
was
found
guilty
and
by
a
vote
of
to
the
extra
vote
being
that
of
his
cousin
the
duke
of
orleans
he
was
condemned
to
death
on
the
of
january
of
the
year
he
quietly
and
with
much
dignity
suffered
himself
to
be
taken
to
the
scaffold
he
had
never
understood
what
all
the
shooting
and
the
fuss
had
been
about
and
he
had
been
too
proud
to
ask
questions
then
the
jacobins
turned
against
the
more
moderate
element
in
the
convention
the
girondists
called
after
their
southern
district
the
gironde
a
special
revolutionary
tribunal
was
instituted
and
of
the
leading
girondists
were
condemned
to
death
the
others
committed
suicide
they
were
capable
and
honest
men
but
too
philosophical
and
too
moderate
to
survive
during
these
frightful
years
in
october
of
the
year
the
constitution
was
suspended
by
the
jacobins
until
peace
should
have
been
declared
all
power
was
placed
in
the
hands
of
a
small
committee
of
public
safety
with
danton
and
robespierre
as
its
leaders
the
christian
religion
and
the
old
chronology
were
abolished
the
age
of
reason
of
which
thomas
paine
had
written
so
eloquently
during
the
american
revolution
had
come
and
with
it
the
terror
which
for
more
than
a
year
killed
good
and
bad
and
indifferent
people
at
the
rate
of
seventy
or
eighty
a
day
the
autocratic
rule
of
the
king
had
been
destroyed
it
was
succeeded
by
the
tyranny
of
a
few
people
who
had
such
a
passionate
love
for
democratic
virtue
that
they
felt
compelled
to
kill
all
those
who
disagreed
with
them
france
was
turned
into
a
slaughter
house
everybody
suspected
everybody
else
no
one
felt
safe
out
of
sheer
fear
a
few
members
of
the
old
convention
who
knew
that
they
were
the
next
candidates
for
the
scaffold
finally
turned
against
robespierre
who
had
already
decapitated
most
of
his
former
colleagues
robespierre
the
only
true
and
pure
democrat
tried
to
kill
himself
but
failed
his
shattered
jaw
was
hastily
bandaged
and
he
was
dragged
to
the
guillotine
on
the
of
july
of
the
year
the
thermidor
of
the
year
ii
according
to
the
strange
chronology
of
the
revolution
the
reign
of
terror
came
to
an
end
and
all
paris
danced
with
joy
the
dangerous
position
of
france
however
made
it
necessary
that
the
government
remain
in
the
hands
of
a
few
strong
men
until
the
many
enemies
of
the
revolution
should
have
been
driven
from
the
soil
of
the
french
fatherland
while
the
and
revolutionary
armies
fought
their
desperate
battles
of
the
rhine
and
italy
and
belgium
and
egypt
and
defeated
every
one
of
the
enemies
of
the
great
revolution
five
directors
were
appointed
and
they
ruled
france
for
four
years
then
the
power
was
vested
in
the
hands
of
a
successful
general
by
the
name
of
napoleon
bonaparte
who
became
first
consul
of
france
in
the
year
and
during
the
next
fifteen
years
the
old
european
continent
became
the
laboratory
of
a
number
of
political
experiments
the
like
of
which
the
world
had
never
seen
before
napoleon
napoleon
napoleon
was
born
in
the
year
the
third
son
of
carlo
maria
buonaparte
an
honest
notary
public
of
the
city
of
ajaccio
in
the
island
of
corsica
and
his
good
wife
letizia
ramolino
he
therefore
was
not
a
frenchman
but
an
italian
whose
native
island
an
old
greek
carthaginian
and
roman
colony
in
the
mediterranean
sea
had
for
years
been
struggling
to
regain
its
independence
first
of
all
from
the
genoese
and
after
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
from
the
french
who
had
kindly
offered
to
help
the
corsicans
in
their
struggle
for
freedom
and
had
then
occupied
the
island
for
their
own
benefit
during
the
first
twenty
years
of
his
life
young
napoleon
was
a
professional
corsican
patriot
a
corsican
sinn
feiner
who
hoped
to
deliver
his
beloved
country
from
the
yoke
of
the
bitterly
hated
french
enemy
but
the
french
revolution
had
unexpectedly
recognised
the
claims
of
the
corsicans
and
gradually
napoleon
who
had
received
a
good
training
at
the
military
school
of
brienne
drifted
into
the
service
of
his
adopted
country
although
he
never
learned
to
spell
french
correctly
or
to
speak
it
without
a
broad
italian
accent
he
became
a
frenchman
in
due
time
he
came
to
stand
as
the
highest
expression
of
all
french
virtues
at
present
he
is
regarded
as
the
symbol
of
the
gallic
genius
napoleon
was
what
is
called
a
fast
worker
his
career
does
not
cover
more
than
twenty
years
in
that
short
span
of
time
he
fought
more
wars
and
gained
more
victories
and
marched
more
miles
and
conquered
more
square
kilometers
and
killed
more
people
and
brought
about
more
reforms
and
generally
upset
europe
to
a
greater
extent
than
anybody
including
alexander
the
great
and
jenghis
khan
had
ever
managed
to
do
he
was
a
little
fellow
and
during
the
first
years
of
his
life
his
health
was
not
very
good
he
never
impressed
anybody
by
his
good
looks
and
he
remained
to
the
end
of
his
days
very
clumsy
whenever
he
was
obliged
to
appear
at
a
social
function
he
did
not
enjoy
a
single
advantage
of
breeding
or
birth
or
riches
for
the
greater
part
of
his
youth
he
was
desperately
poor
and
often
he
had
to
go
without
a
meal
or
was
obliged
to
make
a
few
extra
pennies
in
curious
ways
he
gave
little
promise
as
a
literary
genius
when
he
competed
for
a
prize
offered
by
the
academy
of
lyons
his
essay
was
found
to
be
next
to
the
last
and
he
was
number
out
of
candidates
but
he
overcame
all
these
difficulties
through
his
absolute
and
unshakable
belief
in
his
own
destiny
and
in
his
own
glorious
future
ambition
was
the
of
his
life
the
thought
of
self
the
worship
of
that
capital
letter
n
with
which
he
signed
all
his
letters
and
which
recurred
forever
in
the
ornaments
of
his
hastily
constructed
palaces
the
absolute
will
to
make
the
name
napoleon
the
most
important
thing
in
the
world
next
to
the
name
of
god
these
desires
carried
napoleon
to
a
pinnacle
of
fame
which
no
other
man
has
ever
reached
when
he
was
a
lieutenant
young
bonaparte
was
very
fond
of
the
lives
of
famous
men
which
plutarch
the
roman
historian
had
written
but
he
never
tried
to
live
up
to
the
high
standard
of
character
set
by
these
heroes
of
the
older
days
napoleon
seems
to
have
been
devoid
of
all
those
considerate
and
thoughtful
sentiments
which
make
men
different
from
the
animals
it
will
be
very
difficult
to
decide
with
any
degree
of
accuracy
whether
he
ever
loved
anyone
besides
himself
he
kept
a
civil
tongue
to
his
mother
but
letizia
had
the
air
and
manners
of
a
great
lady
and
after
the
fashion
of
italian
mothers
she
knew
how
to
rule
her
brood
of
children
and
command
their
respect
for
a
few
years
he
was
fond
of
josephine
his
pretty
creole
wife
who
was
the
daughter
of
a
french
officer
of
martinique
and
the
widow
of
the
vicomte
de
beauharnais
who
had
been
executed
by
robespierre
when
he
lost
a
battle
against
the
prussians
but
the
emperor
divorced
her
when
she
failed
to
give
him
a
son
and
heir
and
married
the
daughter
of
the
austrian
emperor
because
it
seemed
good
policy
during
the
siege
of
toulon
where
he
gained
great
fame
as
commander
of
a
battery
napoleon
studied
macchiavelli
with
industrious
care
he
followed
the
advice
of
the
florentine
statesman
and
never
kept
his
word
when
it
was
to
his
advantage
to
break
it
the
word
gratitude
did
not
occur
in
his
personal
dictionary
neither
to
be
quite
fair
did
he
expect
it
from
others
he
was
totally
indifferent
to
human
suffering
he
executed
prisoners
of
war
in
egypt
in
who
had
been
promised
their
lives
and
he
quietly
allowed
his
wounded
in
syria
to
be
chloroformed
when
he
found
it
impossible
to
transport
them
to
his
ships
he
ordered
the
duke
of
enghien
to
be
condemned
to
death
by
a
prejudiced
and
to
be
shot
contrary
to
all
law
on
the
sole
ground
that
the
bourbons
needed
a
warning
he
decreed
that
those
german
officers
who
were
made
prisoner
while
fighting
for
their
country
independence
should
be
shot
against
the
nearest
wall
and
when
andreas
hofer
the
tyrolese
hero
fell
into
his
hands
after
a
most
heroic
resistance
he
was
executed
like
a
common
traitor
in
short
when
we
study
the
character
of
the
emperor
we
begin
to
understand
those
anxious
british
mothers
who
used
to
drive
their
children
to
bed
with
the
threat
that
bonaparte
who
ate
little
boys
and
girls
for
breakfast
would
come
and
get
them
if
they
were
not
very
good
and
yet
having
said
these
many
unpleasant
things
about
this
strange
tyrant
who
looked
after
every
other
department
of
his
army
with
the
utmost
care
but
neglected
the
medical
service
and
who
ruined
his
uniforms
with
eau
de
cologne
because
he
could
not
stand
the
smell
of
his
poor
sweating
soldiers
having
said
all
these
unpleasant
things
and
being
fully
prepared
to
add
many
more
i
must
confess
to
a
certain
lurking
feeling
of
doubt
here
i
am
sitting
at
a
comfortable
table
loaded
heavily
with
books
with
one
eye
on
my
typewriter
and
the
other
on
licorice
the
cat
who
has
a
great
fondness
for
carbon
paper
and
i
am
telling
you
that
the
emperor
napoleon
was
a
most
contemptible
person
but
should
i
happen
to
look
out
of
the
window
down
upon
seventh
avenue
and
should
the
endless
procession
of
trucks
and
carts
come
to
a
sudden
halt
and
should
i
hear
the
sound
of
the
heavy
drums
and
see
the
little
man
on
his
white
horse
in
his
old
and
green
uniform
then
i
do
know
but
i
am
afraid
that
i
would
leave
my
books
and
the
kitten
and
my
home
and
everything
else
to
follow
him
wherever
he
cared
to
lead
my
own
grandfather
did
this
and
heaven
knows
he
was
not
born
to
be
a
hero
millions
of
other
people
grandfathers
did
it
they
received
no
reward
but
they
expected
none
they
cheerfully
gave
legs
and
arms
and
lives
to
serve
this
foreigner
who
took
them
a
thousand
miles
away
from
their
homes
and
marched
them
into
a
barrage
of
russian
or
english
or
spanish
or
italian
or
austrian
cannon
and
stared
quietly
into
space
while
they
were
rolling
in
the
agony
of
death
if
you
ask
me
for
an
explanation
i
must
answer
that
i
have
none
i
can
only
guess
at
one
of
the
reasons
napoleon
was
the
greatest
of
actors
and
the
whole
european
continent
was
his
stage
at
all
times
and
under
all
circumstances
he
knew
the
precise
attitude
that
would
impress
the
spectators
most
and
he
understood
what
words
would
make
the
deepest
impression
whether
he
spoke
in
the
egyptian
desert
before
the
backdrop
of
the
sphinx
and
the
pyramids
or
addressed
his
shivering
men
on
the
plains
of
italy
made
no
difference
at
all
times
he
was
master
of
the
situation
even
at
the
end
an
exile
on
a
little
rock
in
the
middle
of
the
atlantic
a
sick
man
at
the
mercy
of
a
dull
and
intolerable
british
governor
he
held
the
centre
of
the
stage
after
the
defeat
of
waterloo
no
one
outside
of
a
few
trusted
friends
ever
saw
the
great
emperor
the
people
of
europe
knew
that
he
was
living
on
the
island
of
helena
they
knew
that
a
british
garrison
guarded
him
day
and
night
they
knew
that
the
british
fleet
guarded
the
garrison
which
guarded
the
emperor
on
his
farm
at
longwood
but
he
was
never
out
of
the
mind
of
either
friend
or
enemy
when
illness
and
despair
had
at
last
taken
him
away
his
silent
eyes
continued
to
haunt
the
world
even
he
is
as
much
of
a
force
in
the
life
of
france
as
a
hundred
years
ago
when
people
fainted
at
the
mere
sight
of
this
man
who
stabled
his
horses
in
the
holiest
temples
of
the
russian
kremlin
and
who
treated
the
pope
and
the
mighty
ones
of
this
earth
as
if
they
were
his
lackeys
to
give
you
a
mere
outline
of
his
life
would
demand
couple
of
volumes
to
tell
you
of
his
great
political
reform
of
the
french
state
of
his
new
codes
of
laws
which
were
adopted
in
most
european
countries
of
his
activities
in
every
field
of
public
activity
would
take
thousands
of
pages
but
i
can
explain
in
a
few
words
why
he
was
so
successful
during
the
first
part
of
his
career
and
why
he
failed
during
the
last
ten
years
from
the
year
until
the
year
napoleon
was
the
great
leader
of
the
french
revolution
he
was
not
merely
fighting
for
the
glory
of
his
own
name
he
defeated
austria
and
italy
and
england
and
russia
because
he
himself
and
his
soldiers
were
the
apostles
of
the
new
creed
of
liberty
fraternity
and
equality
and
were
the
enemies
of
the
courts
while
they
were
the
friends
of
the
people
but
in
the
year
napoleon
made
himself
hereditary
emperor
of
the
french
and
sent
for
pope
pius
vii
to
come
and
crown
him
even
as
leo
iii
in
the
year
had
crowned
that
other
great
king
of
the
franks
charlemagne
whose
example
was
constantly
before
napoleon
eyes
once
upon
the
throne
the
old
revolutionary
chieftain
became
an
unsuccessful
imitation
of
a
habsburg
monarch
he
forgot
his
spiritual
mother
the
political
club
of
the
jacobins
he
ceased
to
be
the
defender
of
the
oppressed
he
became
the
chief
of
all
the
oppressors
and
kept
his
shooting
squads
ready
to
execute
those
who
dared
to
oppose
his
imperial
will
no
one
had
shed
a
tear
when
in
the
year
the
sad
remains
of
the
holy
roman
empire
were
carted
to
the
historical
dustbin
and
when
the
last
relic
of
ancient
roman
glory
was
destroyed
by
the
grandson
of
an
italian
peasant
but
when
the
napoleonic
armies
had
invaded
spain
had
forced
the
spaniards
to
recognise
a
king
whom
they
detested
had
massacred
the
poor
madrilenes
who
remained
faithful
to
their
old
rulers
then
public
opinion
turned
against
the
former
hero
of
marengo
and
austerlitz
and
a
hundred
other
revolutionary
battles
then
and
only
then
when
napoleon
was
no
longer
the
hero
of
the
revolution
but
the
personification
of
all
the
bad
traits
of
the
old
regime
was
it
possible
for
england
to
give
direction
to
the
sentiment
of
hatred
which
was
turning
all
honest
men
into
enemies
of
the
french
emperor
the
english
people
from
the
very
beginning
had
felt
deeply
disgusted
when
their
newspapers
told
them
the
gruesome
details
of
the
terror
they
had
staged
their
own
great
revolution
during
the
reign
of
charles
i
a
century
before
it
had
been
a
very
simple
affair
compared
to
the
upheaval
of
paris
in
the
eyes
of
the
average
englishman
a
jacobin
was
a
monster
to
be
shot
at
sight
and
napoleon
was
the
chief
devil
the
british
fleet
had
blockaded
france
ever
since
the
year
it
had
spoiled
napoleon
plan
to
invade
india
by
way
of
egypt
and
had
forced
him
to
beat
an
ignominious
retreat
after
his
victories
along
the
banks
of
the
nile
and
finally
in
the
year
england
got
the
chance
it
had
waited
for
so
long
near
cape
trafalgar
on
the
southwestern
coast
of
spain
nelson
annihilated
the
napoleonic
fleet
beyond
a
possible
chance
of
recovery
from
that
moment
on
the
emperor
was
landlocked
even
so
he
would
have
been
able
to
maintain
himself
as
the
recognised
ruler
of
the
continent
had
he
understood
the
signs
of
the
times
and
accepted
the
honourable
peace
which
the
powers
offered
him
but
napoleon
had
been
blinded
by
the
blaze
of
his
own
glory
he
would
recognise
no
equals
he
could
tolerate
no
rivals
and
his
hatred
turned
against
russia
the
mysterious
land
of
the
endless
plains
with
its
inexhaustible
supply
of
as
long
as
russia
was
ruled
by
paul
i
the
son
of
catherine
the
great
napoleon
had
known
how
to
deal
with
the
situation
but
paul
grew
more
and
more
irresponsible
until
his
exasperated
subjects
were
obliged
to
murder
him
lest
they
all
be
sent
to
the
siberian
and
the
son
of
paul
the
emperor
alexander
did
not
share
his
affection
for
the
usurper
whom
he
regarded
as
the
enemy
of
mankind
the
eternal
disturber
of
the
peace
he
was
a
pious
man
who
believed
that
he
had
been
chosen
by
god
to
deliver
the
world
from
the
corsican
curse
he
joined
prussia
and
england
and
austria
and
he
was
defeated
he
tried
five
times
and
five
times
he
failed
in
the
year
he
once
more
taunted
napoleon
until
the
french
emperor
in
a
blind
rage
vowed
that
he
would
dictate
peace
in
moscow
then
from
far
and
wide
from
spain
and
germany
and
holland
and
italy
and
portugal
unwilling
regiments
were
driven
northward
that
the
wounded
pride
of
the
great
emperor
might
be
duly
avenged
the
rest
of
the
story
is
common
knowledge
after
a
march
of
two
months
napoleon
reached
the
russian
capital
and
established
his
headquarters
in
the
holy
kremlin
on
the
night
of
september
of
the
year
moscow
caught
fire
the
town
burned
four
days
when
the
evening
of
the
fifth
day
came
napoleon
gave
the
order
for
the
retreat
two
weeks
later
it
began
to
snow
the
army
trudged
through
mud
and
sleet
until
november
the
when
the
river
berezina
was
reached
then
the
russian
attacks
began
in
all
seriousness
the
cossacks
swarmed
around
the
grande
armee
which
was
no
longer
an
army
but
a
mob
in
the
middle
of
december
the
first
of
the
survivors
began
to
be
seen
in
the
german
cities
of
the
east
then
there
were
many
rumours
of
an
impending
revolt
the
time
has
come
the
people
of
europe
said
to
free
ourselves
from
this
insufferable
yoke
and
they
began
to
look
for
old
shotguns
which
had
escaped
the
eye
of
the
french
spies
but
ere
they
knew
what
had
happened
napoleon
was
back
with
a
new
army
he
had
left
his
defeated
soldiers
and
in
his
little
sleigh
had
rushed
ahead
to
paris
making
a
final
appeal
for
more
troops
that
he
might
defend
the
sacred
soil
of
france
against
foreign
invasion
children
of
sixteen
and
seventeen
followed
him
when
he
moved
eastward
to
meet
the
allied
powers
on
october
and
of
the
year
the
terrible
battle
of
leipzig
took
place
where
for
three
days
boys
in
green
and
boys
in
blue
fought
each
other
until
the
elbe
ran
red
with
blood
on
the
afternoon
of
the
of
october
the
massed
reserves
of
russian
infantry
broke
through
the
french
lines
and
napoleon
fled
back
to
paris
he
went
he
abdicated
in
favour
of
his
small
son
but
the
allied
powers
insisted
that
louis
xviii
the
brother
of
the
late
king
louis
xvi
should
occupy
the
french
throne
and
surrounded
by
cossacks
and
uhlans
the
bourbon
prince
made
his
triumphal
entry
into
paris
as
for
napoleon
he
was
made
the
sovereign
ruler
of
the
little
island
of
elba
in
the
mediterranean
where
he
organised
his
stable
boys
into
a
miniature
army
and
fought
battles
on
a
chess
board
but
no
sooner
had
he
left
france
than
the
people
began
to
realise
what
they
had
lost
the
last
twenty
years
however
costly
had
been
a
period
of
great
glory
paris
had
been
the
capital
of
the
world
the
fat
bourbon
king
who
had
learned
nothing
and
had
forgotten
nothing
during
the
days
of
his
exile
disgusted
everybody
by
his
indolence
on
the
first
of
march
of
the
year
when
the
representatives
of
the
allies
were
ready
to
begin
the
work
of
unscrambling
the
map
of
europe
napoleon
suddenly
landed
near
cannes
in
less
than
a
week
the
french
army
had
deserted
the
bourbons
and
had
rushed
southward
to
offer
their
swords
and
bayonets
to
the
little
corporal
napoleon
marched
straight
to
paris
where
he
arrived
on
the
twentieth
of
march
this
time
he
was
more
cautious
he
offered
peace
but
the
allies
insisted
upon
war
the
whole
of
europe
arose
against
the
perfidious
corsican
rapidly
the
emperor
marched
northward
that
he
might
crush
his
enemies
before
they
should
be
able
to
unite
their
forces
but
napoleon
was
no
longer
his
old
self
he
felt
sick
he
got
tired
easily
he
slept
when
he
ought
to
have
been
up
directing
the
attack
of
his
besides
he
missed
many
of
his
faithful
old
generals
they
were
dead
early
in
june
his
armies
entered
belgium
on
the
of
that
month
he
defeated
the
prussians
under
blucher
but
a
subordinate
commander
failed
to
destroy
the
retreating
army
as
he
had
been
ordered
to
do
two
days
later
napoleon
met
wellington
near
waterloo
it
was
the
of
june
a
sunday
at
two
of
the
afternoon
the
battle
seemed
won
for
the
french
at
three
a
speck
of
dust
appeared
upon
the
eastern
horizon
napoleon
believed
that
this
meant
the
approach
of
his
own
cavalry
who
would
now
turn
the
english
defeat
into
a
rout
at
four
he
knew
better
cursing
and
swearing
old
blucher
drove
his
deathly
tired
troops
into
the
heart
of
the
fray
the
shock
broke
the
ranks
of
the
guards
napoleon
had
no
further
reserves
he
told
his
men
to
save
themselves
as
best
they
could
and
he
fled
for
a
second
time
he
abdicated
in
favor
of
his
son
just
one
hundred
days
after
his
escape
from
elba
he
was
making
for
the
coast
he
intended
to
go
to
america
in
the
year
for
a
mere
song
he
had
sold
the
french
colony
of
louisiana
which
was
in
great
danger
of
being
captured
by
the
english
to
the
young
american
republic
the
americans
so
he
said
will
be
grateful
and
will
give
me
a
little
bit
of
land
and
a
house
where
i
may
spend
the
last
days
of
my
life
in
peace
and
quiet
but
the
english
fleet
was
watching
all
french
harbours
caught
between
the
armies
of
the
allies
and
the
ships
of
the
british
napoleon
had
no
choice
the
prussians
intended
to
shoot
him
the
english
might
be
more
generous
at
rochefort
he
waited
in
the
hope
that
something
might
turn
up
one
month
after
waterloo
he
received
orders
from
the
new
french
government
to
leave
french
soil
inside
of
hours
always
the
tragedian
he
wrote
a
letter
to
the
prince
regent
of
england
george
iv
the
king
was
in
an
insane
asylum
informing
his
royal
highness
of
his
intention
to
throw
himself
upon
the
mercy
of
his
enemies
and
like
themistocles
to
look
for
a
welcome
at
the
fireside
of
his
foes
on
the
of
july
he
went
on
board
the
bellerophon
and
surrendered
his
sword
to
admiral
hotham
at
plymouth
he
was
transferred
to
the
northumberland
which
carried
him
to
helena
there
he
spent
the
last
seven
years
of
his
life
he
tried
to
write
his
memoirs
he
quarrelled
with
his
keepers
and
he
dreamed
of
past
times
curiously
enough
he
returned
at
least
in
his
imagination
to
his
original
point
of
departure
he
remembered
the
days
when
he
had
fought
the
battles
of
the
revolution
he
tried
to
convince
himself
that
he
had
always
been
the
true
friend
of
those
great
principles
of
liberty
fraternity
and
equality
which
the
ragged
soldiers
of
the
convention
had
carried
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
he
liked
to
dwell
upon
his
career
as
and
consul
he
rarely
spoke
of
the
empire
sometimes
he
thought
of
his
son
the
duke
of
reichstadt
the
little
eagle
who
lived
in
vienna
where
he
was
treated
as
a
poor
relation
by
his
young
habsburg
cousins
whose
fathers
had
trembled
at
the
very
mention
of
the
name
of
him
when
the
end
came
he
was
leading
his
troops
to
victory
he
ordered
ney
to
attack
with
the
guards
then
he
died
but
if
you
want
an
explanation
of
this
strange
career
if
you
really
wish
to
know
how
one
man
could
possibly
rule
so
many
people
for
so
many
years
by
the
sheer
force
of
his
will
do
not
read
the
books
that
have
been
written
about
him
their
authors
either
hated
the
emperor
or
loved
him
you
will
learn
many
facts
but
it
is
more
important
to
feel
history
than
to
know
it
do
read
but
wait
until
you
have
a
chance
to
hear
a
good
artist
sing
the
song
called
the
two
grenadiers
the
words
were
written
by
heine
the
great
german
poet
who
lived
through
the
napoleonic
era
the
music
was
composed
by
schumann
a
german
who
saw
the
emperor
the
enemy
of
his
country
whenever
he
came
to
visit
his
imperial
the
song
therefore
is
the
work
of
two
men
who
had
every
reason
to
hate
the
tyrant
go
and
hear
it
then
you
will
understand
what
a
thousand
volumes
could
not
possibly
tell
you
the
holy
alliance
as
soon
as
napoleon
had
been
sent
to
helena
the
rulers
who
so
often
had
been
defeated
by
the
hated
corsican
met
at
vienna
and
tried
to
undo
the
many
changes
that
had
been
brought
about
by
the
french
revolution
the
imperial
highnesses
the
royal
highnesses
their
graces
the
dukes
the
ministers
extraordinary
and
plenipotentiary
together
with
the
plain
excellencies
and
their
army
of
secretaries
servants
and
whose
labours
had
been
so
rudely
interrupted
by
the
sudden
return
of
the
terrible
corsican
now
sweltering
under
the
hot
sun
of
helena
went
back
to
their
jobs
the
victory
was
duly
celebrated
with
dinners
garden
parties
and
balls
at
which
the
new
and
very
shocking
waltz
was
danced
to
the
great
scandal
of
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
remembered
the
minuet
of
the
old
regime
for
almost
a
generation
they
had
lived
in
retirement
at
last
the
danger
was
over
they
were
very
eloquent
upon
the
subject
of
the
terrible
hardships
which
they
had
suffered
and
they
expected
to
be
recompensed
for
every
penny
they
had
lost
at
the
hands
of
the
unspeakable
jacobins
who
had
dared
to
kill
their
anointed
king
who
had
abolished
wigs
and
who
had
discarded
the
short
trousers
of
the
court
of
versailles
for
the
ragged
pantaloons
of
the
parisian
slums
you
may
think
it
absurd
that
i
should
mention
such
a
detail
but
if
you
please
the
congress
of
vienna
was
one
long
succession
of
such
absurdities
and
for
many
months
the
question
of
short
trousers
long
trousers
interested
the
delegates
more
than
the
future
settlement
of
the
saxon
or
spanish
problems
his
majesty
the
king
of
prussia
went
so
far
as
to
order
a
pair
of
short
ones
that
he
might
give
public
evidence
of
his
contempt
for
everything
revolutionary
another
german
potentate
not
to
be
outdone
in
this
noble
hatred
for
the
revolution
decreed
that
all
taxes
which
his
subjects
had
paid
to
the
french
usurper
should
be
paid
a
second
time
to
the
legitimate
ruler
who
had
loved
his
people
from
afar
while
they
were
at
the
mercy
of
the
corsican
ogre
and
so
on
from
one
blunder
to
another
until
one
gasps
and
exclaims
but
why
in
the
name
of
high
heaven
did
not
the
people
object
why
not
indeed
because
the
people
were
utterly
exhausted
were
desperate
did
not
care
what
happened
or
how
or
where
or
by
whom
they
were
ruled
provided
there
was
peace
they
were
sick
and
tired
of
war
and
revolution
and
reform
in
the
eighties
of
the
previous
century
they
had
all
danced
around
the
tree
of
liberty
princes
had
embraced
their
cooks
and
duchesses
had
danced
the
carmagnole
with
their
lackeys
in
the
honest
belief
that
the
millennium
of
equality
and
fraternity
had
at
last
dawned
upon
this
wicked
world
instead
of
the
millennium
they
had
been
visited
by
the
revolutionary
commissary
who
had
lodged
a
dozen
dirty
soldiers
in
their
parlor
and
had
stolen
the
family
plate
when
he
returned
to
paris
to
report
to
his
government
upon
the
enthusiasm
with
which
the
liberated
country
had
received
the
constitution
which
the
french
people
had
presented
to
their
good
neighbours
when
they
had
heard
how
the
last
outbreak
of
revolutionary
disorder
in
paris
had
been
suppressed
by
a
young
officer
called
bonaparte
or
buonaparte
who
had
turned
his
guns
upon
the
mob
they
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
a
little
less
liberty
fraternity
and
equality
seemed
a
very
desirable
thing
but
ere
long
the
young
officer
called
buonaparte
or
bonaparte
became
one
of
the
three
consuls
of
the
french
republic
then
sole
consul
and
finally
emperor
as
he
was
much
more
efficient
than
any
ruler
that
had
ever
been
seen
before
his
hand
pressed
heavily
upon
his
poor
subjects
he
showed
them
no
mercy
he
impressed
their
sons
into
his
armies
he
married
their
daughters
to
his
generals
and
he
took
their
pictures
and
their
statues
to
enrich
his
own
museums
he
turned
the
whole
of
europe
into
an
armed
camp
and
killed
almost
an
entire
generation
of
men
now
he
was
gone
and
the
people
except
a
few
professional
military
men
had
but
one
wish
they
wanted
to
be
let
alone
for
awhile
they
had
been
allowed
to
rule
themselves
to
vote
for
mayors
and
aldermen
and
judges
the
system
had
been
a
terrible
failure
the
new
rulers
had
been
inexperienced
and
extravagant
from
sheer
despair
the
people
turned
to
the
representative
men
of
the
old
regime
you
rule
us
they
said
as
you
used
to
do
tell
us
what
we
owe
you
for
taxes
and
leave
us
alone
we
are
busy
repairing
the
damage
of
the
age
of
liberty
the
men
who
the
famous
congress
certainly
did
their
best
to
satisfy
this
longing
for
rest
and
quiet
the
holy
alliance
the
main
result
of
the
congress
made
the
policeman
the
most
important
dignitary
of
the
state
and
held
out
the
most
terrible
punishment
to
those
who
dared
criticise
a
single
official
act
europe
had
peace
but
it
was
the
peace
of
the
cemetery
the
three
most
important
men
at
vienna
were
the
emperor
alexander
of
russia
metternich
who
represented
the
interests
of
the
austrian
house
of
habsburg
and
talleyrand
the
erstwhile
bishop
of
autun
who
had
managed
to
live
through
the
different
changes
in
the
french
government
by
the
sheer
force
of
his
cunning
and
his
intelligence
and
who
now
travelled
to
the
austrian
capital
to
save
for
his
country
whatever
could
be
saved
from
the
napoleonic
ruin
like
the
gay
young
man
of
the
limerick
who
never
knew
when
he
was
slighted
this
unbidden
guest
came
to
the
party
and
ate
just
as
heartily
as
if
he
had
been
really
invited
indeed
before
long
he
was
sitting
at
the
head
of
the
table
entertaining
everybody
with
his
amusing
stories
and
gaining
the
company
good
will
by
the
charm
of
his
manner
before
he
had
been
in
vienna
hours
he
knew
that
the
allies
were
divided
into
two
hostile
camps
on
the
one
side
were
russia
who
wanted
to
take
poland
and
prussia
who
wanted
to
annex
saxony
and
on
the
other
side
were
austria
and
england
who
were
trying
to
prevent
this
grab
because
it
was
against
their
own
interest
that
either
prussia
or
russia
should
be
able
to
dominate
europe
talleyrand
played
the
two
sides
against
each
other
with
great
skill
and
it
was
due
to
his
efforts
that
the
french
people
were
not
made
to
suffer
for
the
ten
years
of
oppression
which
europe
had
endured
at
the
hands
of
the
imperial
officials
he
argued
that
the
french
people
had
been
given
no
choice
in
the
matter
napoleon
had
forced
them
to
act
at
his
bidding
but
napoleon
was
gone
and
louis
xviii
was
on
the
throne
give
him
a
chance
talleyrand
pleaded
and
the
allies
glad
to
see
a
legitimate
king
upon
the
throne
of
a
revolutionary
country
obligingly
yielded
and
the
bourbons
were
given
their
chance
of
which
they
made
such
use
that
they
were
driven
out
after
fifteen
years
the
second
man
of
the
triumvirate
of
vienna
was
metternich
the
austrian
prime
minister
the
leader
of
the
foreign
policy
of
the
house
of
habsburg
wenzel
lothar
prince
of
was
exactly
what
the
name
suggests
he
was
a
grand
seigneur
a
very
handsome
gentleman
with
very
fine
manners
immensely
rich
and
very
able
but
the
product
of
a
society
which
lived
a
thousand
miles
away
from
the
sweating
multitudes
who
worked
and
slaved
in
the
cities
and
on
the
farms
as
a
young
man
metternich
had
been
studying
at
the
university
of
strassburg
when
the
french
revolution
broke
out
strassburg
the
city
which
gave
birth
to
the
marseillaise
had
been
a
centre
of
jacobin
activities
metternich
remembered
that
his
pleasant
social
life
had
been
sadly
interrupted
that
a
lot
of
incompetent
citizens
had
suddenly
been
called
forth
to
perform
tasks
for
which
they
were
not
fit
that
the
mob
had
celebrated
the
dawn
of
the
new
liberty
by
the
murder
of
perfectly
innocent
persons
he
had
failed
to
see
the
honest
enthusiasm
of
the
masses
the
ray
of
hope
in
the
eyes
of
women
and
children
who
carried
bread
and
water
to
the
ragged
troops
of
the
convention
marching
through
the
city
on
their
way
to
the
front
and
a
glorious
death
for
the
french
fatherland
the
whole
thing
had
filled
the
young
austrian
with
disgust
it
was
uncivilised
if
there
were
any
fighting
to
be
done
it
must
be
done
by
dashing
young
men
in
lovely
uniforms
charging
across
the
green
fields
on
horses
but
to
turn
an
entire
country
into
an
armed
camp
where
tramps
were
overnight
promoted
to
be
generals
that
was
both
wicked
and
senseless
see
what
came
of
all
your
fine
ideas
he
would
say
to
the
french
diplomats
whom
he
met
at
a
quiet
little
dinner
given
by
one
of
the
innumerable
austrian
you
wanted
liberty
equality
and
fraternity
and
you
got
napoleon
how
much
better
it
would
have
been
if
you
had
been
contented
with
the
existing
order
of
things
and
he
would
explain
his
system
of
stability
he
would
advocate
a
return
to
the
normalcy
of
the
good
old
days
before
the
war
when
everybody
was
happy
and
nobody
talked
nonsense
about
everybody
being
as
good
as
everybody
else
in
this
attitude
he
was
entirely
sincere
and
as
he
was
an
able
man
of
great
strength
of
will
and
a
tremendous
power
of
persuasion
he
was
one
of
the
most
dangerous
enemies
of
the
revolutionary
ideas
he
did
not
die
until
the
year
and
he
therefore
lived
long
enough
to
see
the
complete
failure
of
all
his
policies
when
they
were
swept
aside
by
the
revolution
of
the
year
he
then
found
himself
the
most
hated
man
of
europe
and
more
than
once
ran
the
risk
of
being
lynched
by
angry
crowds
of
outraged
citizens
but
until
the
very
last
he
remained
steadfast
in
his
belief
that
he
had
done
the
right
thing
he
had
always
been
convinced
that
people
preferred
peace
to
liberty
and
he
had
tried
to
give
them
what
was
best
for
them
and
in
all
fairness
it
ought
to
be
said
that
his
efforts
to
establish
universal
peace
were
fairly
successful
the
great
powers
did
not
fly
at
each
other
throat
for
almost
forty
years
indeed
not
until
the
crimean
war
between
russia
and
england
france
and
italy
and
turkey
in
the
year
that
means
a
record
for
the
european
continent
the
third
hero
of
this
waltzing
congress
was
the
emperor
alexander
he
had
been
brought
up
at
the
court
of
his
the
famous
catherine
the
great
between
the
lessons
of
this
shrewd
old
woman
who
taught
him
to
regard
the
glory
of
russia
as
the
most
important
thing
in
life
and
those
of
his
private
tutor
a
swiss
admirer
of
voltaire
and
rousseau
who
filled
his
mind
with
a
general
love
of
humanity
the
boy
grew
up
to
be
a
strange
mixture
of
a
selfish
tyrant
and
a
sentimental
revolutionist
he
had
suffered
great
indignities
during
the
life
of
his
crazy
father
paul
i
he
had
been
obliged
to
the
wholesale
slaughter
of
the
napoleonic
then
the
tide
had
turned
his
armies
had
won
the
day
for
the
allies
russia
had
become
the
saviour
of
europe
and
the
tsar
of
this
mighty
people
was
acclaimed
as
a
who
would
cure
the
world
of
its
many
ills
but
alexander
was
not
very
clever
he
did
not
know
men
and
women
as
talleyrand
and
metternich
knew
them
he
did
not
understand
the
strange
game
of
diplomacy
he
was
vain
who
would
not
be
under
the
circumstances
and
loved
to
hear
the
applause
of
the
multitude
and
soon
he
had
become
the
main
attraction
of
the
congress
while
metternich
and
talleyrand
and
castlereagh
the
very
able
british
representative
sat
around
a
table
and
drank
a
bottle
of
tokay
and
decided
what
was
actually
going
to
be
done
they
needed
russia
and
therefore
they
were
very
polite
to
alexander
but
the
less
he
had
personally
to
do
with
the
actual
work
of
the
congress
the
better
they
were
pleased
they
even
encouraged
his
plans
for
a
holy
alliance
that
he
might
be
fully
occupied
while
they
were
engaged
upon
the
work
at
hand
alexander
was
a
sociable
person
who
liked
to
go
to
parties
and
meet
people
upon
such
occasions
he
was
happy
and
gay
but
there
was
a
very
different
element
in
his
character
he
tried
to
forget
something
which
he
could
not
forget
on
the
night
of
the
of
march
of
the
year
he
had
been
sitting
in
a
room
of
the
michael
palace
in
petersburg
waiting
for
the
news
of
his
father
abdication
but
paul
had
refused
to
sign
the
document
which
the
drunken
officers
had
placed
before
him
on
the
table
and
in
their
rage
they
had
put
a
scarf
around
his
neck
and
had
strangled
him
to
death
then
they
had
gone
downstairs
to
tell
alexander
that
he
was
emperor
of
all
the
russian
lands
the
memory
of
this
terrible
night
stayed
with
the
tsar
who
was
a
very
sensitive
person
he
had
been
educated
in
the
school
of
the
great
french
philosophers
who
did
not
believe
in
god
but
in
human
reason
but
reason
alone
could
not
satisfy
the
emperor
in
his
predicament
he
began
to
hear
voices
and
see
things
he
tried
to
find
a
way
by
which
he
could
square
himself
with
his
conscience
he
became
very
pious
and
began
to
take
an
interest
in
mysticism
that
strange
love
of
the
mysterious
and
the
unknown
which
is
as
old
as
the
temples
of
thebes
and
babylon
the
tremendous
emotion
of
the
great
revolutionary
era
had
influenced
the
character
of
the
people
of
that
day
in
a
strange
way
men
and
women
who
had
lived
through
twenty
years
of
anxiety
and
fear
were
no
longer
quite
normal
they
jumped
whenever
the
rang
it
might
mean
the
news
of
the
death
on
the
field
of
honour
of
an
only
son
the
phrases
about
brotherly
love
and
liberty
of
the
revolution
were
hollow
words
in
the
ears
of
sorely
stricken
peasants
they
clung
to
anything
that
might
give
them
a
new
hold
on
the
terrible
problems
of
life
in
their
grief
and
misery
they
were
easily
imposed
upon
by
a
large
number
of
imposters
who
posed
as
prophets
and
preached
a
strange
new
doctrine
which
they
dug
out
of
the
more
obscure
passages
of
the
book
of
revelations
in
the
year
alexander
who
had
already
consulted
a
large
number
of
heard
of
a
new
seeress
who
was
foretelling
the
coming
doom
of
the
world
and
was
exhorting
people
to
repent
ere
it
be
too
late
the
baroness
von
krudener
the
lady
in
question
was
a
russian
woman
of
uncertain
age
and
similar
reputation
who
had
been
the
wife
of
a
russian
diplomat
in
the
days
of
the
emperor
paul
she
had
squandered
her
husband
money
and
had
disgraced
him
by
her
strange
love
affairs
she
had
lived
a
very
dissolute
life
until
her
nerves
had
given
way
and
for
a
while
she
was
not
in
her
right
mind
then
she
had
been
converted
by
the
sight
of
the
sudden
death
of
a
friend
thereafter
she
despised
all
gaiety
she
confessed
her
former
sins
to
her
shoemaker
a
pious
moravian
brother
a
follower
of
the
old
reformer
john
huss
who
had
been
burned
for
his
heresies
by
the
council
of
constance
in
the
year
the
next
ten
years
the
baroness
spent
in
germany
making
a
specialty
of
the
conversion
of
kings
and
princes
to
convince
alexander
the
saviour
of
europe
of
the
error
of
his
ways
was
the
greatest
ambition
of
her
life
and
as
alexander
in
his
misery
was
willing
to
listen
to
anybody
who
brought
him
a
ray
of
hope
the
interview
was
easily
arranged
on
the
evening
of
the
fourth
of
june
of
the
year
she
was
admitted
to
the
tent
of
the
emperor
she
found
him
reading
his
bible
we
do
not
know
what
she
said
to
alexander
but
when
she
left
him
three
hours
later
he
was
bathed
in
tears
and
vowed
that
at
last
his
soul
had
found
peace
from
that
day
on
the
baroness
was
his
faithful
companion
and
his
spiritual
adviser
she
followed
him
to
paris
and
then
to
vienna
and
the
time
which
alexander
did
not
spend
dancing
he
spent
at
the
krudener
you
may
ask
why
i
tell
you
this
story
in
such
great
detail
are
not
the
social
changes
of
the
nineteenth
century
of
greater
importance
than
the
career
of
an
woman
who
had
better
be
forgotten
of
course
they
are
but
there
exist
any
number
of
books
which
will
tell
you
of
these
other
things
with
great
accuracy
and
in
great
detail
i
want
you
to
learn
something
more
from
this
history
than
a
mere
succession
of
facts
i
want
you
to
approach
all
historical
events
in
a
frame
of
mind
that
will
take
nothing
for
granted
do
be
satisfied
with
the
mere
statement
that
such
and
such
a
thing
happened
then
and
there
try
to
discover
the
hidden
motives
behind
every
action
and
then
you
will
understand
the
world
around
you
much
better
and
you
will
have
a
greater
chance
to
help
others
which
when
all
is
said
and
done
is
the
only
truly
satisfactory
way
of
living
i
do
not
want
you
to
think
of
the
holy
alliance
as
a
piece
of
paper
which
was
signed
in
the
year
and
lies
dead
and
forgotten
somewhere
in
the
archives
of
state
it
may
be
forgotten
but
it
is
by
no
means
dead
the
holy
alliance
was
directly
responsible
for
the
promulgation
of
the
monroe
doctrine
and
the
monroe
doctrine
of
america
for
the
americans
has
a
very
distinct
bearing
upon
your
own
life
that
is
the
reason
why
i
want
you
to
know
exactly
how
this
document
happened
to
come
into
existence
and
what
the
real
motives
were
underlying
this
outward
manifestation
of
piety
and
christian
devotion
to
duty
the
holy
alliance
was
the
joint
labour
of
an
unfortunate
man
who
had
suffered
a
terrible
mental
shock
and
who
was
trying
to
pacify
his
soul
and
of
an
ambitious
woman
who
after
a
wasted
life
had
lost
her
beauty
and
her
attraction
and
who
satisfied
her
vanity
and
her
desire
for
notoriety
by
assuming
the
role
of
messiah
of
a
new
and
strange
creed
i
am
not
giving
away
any
secrets
when
i
tell
you
these
details
such
sober
minded
people
as
castlereagh
metternich
and
talleyrand
fully
understood
the
limited
abilities
of
the
sentimental
baroness
it
would
have
been
easy
for
metternich
to
send
her
back
to
her
german
estates
a
few
lines
to
the
almighty
commander
of
the
imperial
police
and
the
thing
was
done
but
france
and
england
and
austria
depended
upon
the
of
russia
they
could
not
afford
to
offend
alexander
and
they
tolerated
the
silly
old
baroness
because
they
had
to
and
while
they
regarded
the
holy
alliance
as
utter
rubbish
and
not
worth
the
paper
upon
which
it
was
written
they
listened
patiently
to
the
tsar
when
he
read
them
the
first
rough
draft
of
this
attempt
to
create
the
brotherhood
of
men
upon
a
basis
of
the
holy
scriptures
for
this
is
what
the
holy
alliance
tried
to
do
and
the
signers
of
the
document
solemnly
declared
that
they
would
in
the
administration
of
their
respective
states
and
in
their
political
relations
with
every
other
government
take
for
their
sole
guide
the
precepts
of
that
holy
religion
namely
the
precepts
of
justice
christian
charity
and
peace
which
far
from
being
applicable
only
to
private
concerns
must
have
an
immediate
influence
on
the
councils
of
princes
and
must
guide
all
their
steps
as
being
the
only
means
of
consolidating
human
institutions
and
remedying
their
imperfections
they
then
proceeded
to
promise
each
other
that
they
would
remain
united
by
the
bonds
of
a
true
and
indissoluble
fraternity
and
considering
each
other
as
they
would
on
all
occasions
and
in
all
places
lend
each
other
aid
and
assistance
and
more
words
to
the
same
effect
eventually
the
holy
alliance
was
signed
by
the
emperor
of
austria
who
did
not
understand
a
word
of
it
it
was
signed
by
the
bourbons
who
needed
the
friendship
of
napoleon
old
enemies
it
was
signed
by
the
king
of
prussia
who
hoped
to
gain
alexander
for
his
plans
for
a
greater
prussia
and
by
all
the
little
nations
of
europe
who
were
at
the
mercy
of
russia
england
never
signed
because
castlereagh
thought
the
whole
thing
buncombe
the
pope
did
not
sign
because
he
resented
this
interference
in
his
business
by
a
and
a
protestant
and
the
sultan
did
not
sign
because
he
never
heard
of
it
the
general
mass
of
the
european
people
however
soon
were
forced
to
take
notice
behind
the
hollow
phrases
of
the
holy
alliance
stood
the
armies
of
the
quintuple
alliance
which
metternich
had
created
among
the
great
powers
these
armies
meant
business
they
let
it
be
known
that
the
peace
of
europe
must
not
be
disturbed
by
the
liberals
who
were
in
reality
nothing
but
disguised
jacobins
and
hoped
for
a
return
of
the
revolutionary
days
the
enthusiasm
for
the
great
wars
of
liberation
of
the
years
and
had
begun
to
wear
off
it
had
been
followed
by
a
sincere
belief
in
the
coming
of
a
happier
day
the
soldiers
who
had
borne
the
brunt
of
the
battle
wanted
peace
and
they
said
so
but
they
did
not
want
the
sort
of
peace
which
the
holy
alliance
and
the
council
of
the
european
powers
had
now
bestowed
upon
them
they
cried
that
they
had
been
betrayed
but
they
were
careful
lest
they
be
heard
by
a
spy
the
reaction
was
victorious
it
was
a
reaction
caused
by
men
who
sincerely
believed
that
their
methods
were
necessary
for
the
good
of
humanity
but
it
was
just
as
hard
to
bear
as
if
their
intentions
had
been
less
kind
and
it
caused
a
great
deal
of
unnecessary
suffering
and
greatly
retarded
the
orderly
progress
of
political
development
the
great
reaction
they
tried
to
assure
the
world
an
era
of
undisturbed
peace
by
suppressing
all
new
ideas
they
made
the
the
highest
functionary
in
the
state
and
soon
the
prisons
of
all
countries
were
filled
with
those
who
claimed
that
people
have
the
right
to
govern
themselves
as
they
see
fit
to
undo
the
damage
done
by
the
great
napoleonic
flood
was
almost
impossible
fences
had
been
washed
away
the
palaces
of
two
score
dynasties
had
been
damaged
to
such
an
extent
that
they
had
to
be
condemned
as
uninhabitable
other
royal
residences
had
been
greatly
enlarged
at
the
expense
of
less
fortunate
neighbours
strange
odds
and
ends
of
revolutionary
doctrine
had
been
left
behind
by
the
receding
waters
and
could
not
be
dislodged
without
danger
to
the
entire
community
but
the
political
engineers
of
the
congress
did
the
best
they
could
and
this
is
what
they
accomplished
france
had
disturbed
the
peace
of
the
world
for
so
many
years
that
people
had
come
to
fear
that
country
almost
instinctively
the
bourbons
through
the
mouth
of
talleyrand
had
promised
to
be
good
but
the
hundred
days
had
taught
europe
what
to
expect
should
napoleon
manage
to
escape
for
a
second
time
the
dutch
republic
therefore
was
changed
into
a
kingdom
and
belgium
which
had
not
joined
the
dutch
struggle
for
independence
in
the
sixteenth
century
and
since
then
had
been
part
of
the
habsburg
domains
firs
t
under
spanish
rule
and
thereafter
under
austrian
rule
was
made
part
of
this
new
kingdom
of
the
netherlands
nobody
wanted
this
union
either
in
the
protestant
north
or
in
the
catholic
south
but
no
questions
were
asked
it
seemed
good
for
the
peace
of
europe
and
that
was
the
main
consideration
poland
had
hoped
for
great
things
because
a
pole
prince
adam
czartoryski
was
one
of
the
most
intimate
friends
of
tsar
alexander
and
had
been
his
constant
advisor
during
the
war
and
at
the
congress
of
vienna
but
poland
was
made
a
part
of
russia
with
alexander
as
her
king
this
solution
pleased
no
one
and
caused
much
bitter
feeling
and
three
revolutions
denmark
which
had
remained
a
faithful
ally
of
napoleon
until
the
end
was
severely
punished
seven
years
before
an
english
fleet
had
sailed
down
the
kattegat
and
without
a
declaration
of
war
or
any
warning
had
bombarded
copenhagen
and
had
taken
away
the
danish
fleet
lest
it
be
of
value
to
napoleon
the
congress
of
vienna
went
one
step
further
it
took
norway
which
since
the
union
of
calmar
of
the
year
had
been
united
with
denmark
away
from
denmark
and
gave
it
to
charles
xiv
of
sweden
as
a
reward
for
his
betrayal
of
napoleon
who
had
set
him
up
in
the
king
business
this
swedish
king
curiously
enough
was
a
former
french
general
by
the
name
of
bernadotte
who
had
come
to
sweden
as
one
of
napolean
sic
adjutants
and
had
been
invited
to
the
throne
of
that
good
country
when
the
last
of
the
rulers
of
the
house
of
had
died
without
leaving
either
son
or
daughter
from
until
he
ruled
his
adopted
country
the
language
of
which
he
never
learned
width
great
ability
he
was
a
clever
man
and
enjoyed
the
respect
of
both
his
swedish
and
his
norwegian
subjects
but
he
did
not
succeed
in
joining
two
countries
which
nature
and
history
had
put
asunder
the
dual
scandinavian
state
was
never
a
success
and
in
norway
in
a
most
peaceful
and
orderly
manner
set
up
as
an
independent
kingdom
and
the
swedes
bade
her
good
speed
and
very
wisely
let
her
go
her
own
way
the
italians
who
since
the
days
of
the
renaissance
had
been
at
the
mercy
of
a
long
series
of
invaders
also
had
put
great
hopes
in
general
bonaparte
the
emperor
napoleon
however
had
grievously
disappointed
them
instead
of
the
united
italy
which
the
people
wanted
they
had
been
divided
into
a
number
of
little
principalities
duchies
republics
and
the
papal
state
which
next
to
naples
was
the
worst
governed
and
most
miserable
region
of
the
entire
peninsula
the
congress
of
vienna
abolished
a
few
of
the
napoleonic
republics
and
in
their
place
resurrected
several
old
principalities
which
were
given
to
deserving
members
both
male
and
female
of
the
habsburg
family
the
poor
spaniards
who
had
started
the
great
nationalistic
revolt
against
napoleon
and
who
had
sacrificed
the
best
blood
of
the
country
for
their
king
were
punished
severely
when
the
congress
allowed
his
majesty
to
return
to
his
domains
this
vicious
creature
known
as
ferdinand
vii
had
spent
the
last
four
years
of
his
life
as
a
prisoner
of
napoleon
he
had
improved
his
days
by
knitting
garments
for
the
statues
of
his
favourite
patron
saints
he
celebrated
his
return
by
the
inquisition
and
the
both
of
which
had
been
abolished
by
the
revolution
he
was
a
disgusting
person
despised
as
much
by
his
subjects
as
by
his
four
wives
but
the
holy
alliance
maintained
him
upon
his
legitimate
throne
and
all
efforts
of
the
decent
spaniards
to
get
rid
of
this
curse
and
make
spain
a
constitutional
kingdom
ended
in
bloodshed
and
executions
portugal
had
been
without
a
king
since
the
year
when
the
royal
family
had
fled
to
the
colonies
in
brazil
the
country
had
been
used
as
a
base
of
supply
for
the
armies
of
wellington
during
the
peninsula
war
which
lasted
from
until
after
portugal
continued
to
be
a
sort
of
british
province
until
the
house
of
braganza
returned
to
the
throne
leaving
one
of
its
members
behind
in
rio
de
janeiro
as
emperor
of
brazil
the
only
american
empire
which
lasted
for
more
than
a
few
years
and
which
came
to
an
end
in
when
the
country
became
a
republic
in
the
east
nothing
was
done
to
improve
the
terrible
conditions
of
both
the
slavs
and
the
greeks
who
were
still
subjects
of
the
sultan
in
the
year
black
george
a
servian
swineherd
the
founder
of
the
karageorgevich
dynasty
had
started
a
revolt
against
the
turks
but
he
had
been
defeated
by
his
enemies
and
had
been
murdered
by
one
of
his
supposed
friends
the
rival
servian
leader
called
milosh
obrenovich
who
became
the
founder
of
the
obrenovich
dynasty
and
the
turks
had
continued
to
be
the
undisputed
masters
of
the
balkans
the
greeks
who
since
the
loss
of
their
independence
two
thousand
years
before
had
been
subjects
of
the
macedonians
the
romans
the
venetians
and
the
turks
had
hoped
that
their
countryman
capo
a
native
of
corfu
and
together
with
czartoryski
the
most
intimate
personal
friends
of
alexander
would
do
something
for
them
but
the
congress
of
vienna
was
not
interested
in
greeks
but
was
very
much
interested
in
keeping
all
legitimate
monarchs
christian
moslem
and
otherwise
upon
their
respective
thrones
therefore
nothing
was
done
the
last
but
perhaps
the
greatest
blunder
of
the
congress
was
the
treatment
of
germany
the
reformation
and
the
thirty
years
war
had
not
only
destroyed
the
prosperity
of
the
country
but
had
turned
it
into
a
hopeless
political
rubbish
heap
consisting
of
a
couple
of
kingdoms
a
few
a
large
number
of
duchies
and
hundreds
of
margravates
principalities
baronies
electorates
free
cities
and
free
villages
ruled
by
the
strangest
assortment
of
potentates
that
was
ever
seen
off
the
comic
opera
stage
frederick
the
great
had
changed
this
when
he
created
a
strong
prussia
but
this
state
had
not
survived
him
by
many
years
napoleon
had
the
demand
for
independence
of
most
of
these
little
countries
and
only
out
of
a
total
of
more
than
three
hundred
had
survived
the
year
during
the
years
of
the
great
struggle
for
independence
many
a
young
soldier
had
dreamed
of
a
new
fatherland
that
should
be
strong
and
united
but
there
can
be
no
union
without
a
strong
leadership
and
who
was
to
be
this
leader
there
were
five
kingdoms
in
the
german
speaking
lands
the
rulers
of
two
of
these
austria
and
prussia
were
kings
by
the
grace
of
god
the
rulers
of
three
others
bavaria
saxony
and
wurtemberg
were
kings
by
the
grace
of
napoleon
and
as
they
had
been
the
faithful
henchmen
of
the
emperor
their
patriotic
credit
with
the
other
germans
was
therefore
not
very
good
the
congress
had
established
a
new
german
confederation
a
league
of
sovereign
states
under
the
chairmanship
of
the
king
of
austria
who
was
now
known
as
the
emperor
of
austria
it
was
the
sort
of
arrangement
which
satisfied
no
one
it
is
true
that
a
german
diet
which
met
in
the
old
coronation
city
of
frankfort
had
been
created
to
discuss
matters
of
common
policy
and
importance
but
in
this
diet
delegates
represented
different
interests
and
as
no
decision
could
be
taken
without
a
unanimous
vote
a
parliamentary
rule
which
had
in
previous
centuries
ruined
the
mighty
kingdom
of
poland
the
famous
german
confederation
became
very
soon
the
laughing
stock
of
europe
and
the
politics
of
the
old
empire
began
to
resemble
those
of
our
central
american
neighbours
in
the
forties
and
the
fifties
of
the
last
century
it
was
terribly
humiliating
to
the
people
who
had
sacrificed
everything
for
a
national
ideal
but
the
congress
was
not
interested
in
the
private
feelings
of
subjects
and
the
debate
was
closed
did
anybody
object
most
assuredly
as
soon
as
the
first
feeling
of
hatred
against
napoleon
had
quieted
down
as
soon
as
the
enthusiasm
of
the
great
war
had
subsided
as
soon
as
the
people
came
to
a
full
realisation
of
the
crime
that
had
been
committed
in
the
name
of
peace
and
stability
they
began
to
murmur
they
even
made
threats
of
open
revolt
but
what
could
they
do
they
were
powerless
they
were
at
the
mercy
of
the
most
pitiless
and
efficient
police
system
the
world
had
ever
seen
the
members
of
the
congress
of
vienna
honestly
and
sincerely
believed
that
the
revolutionary
principle
had
led
to
the
criminal
usurpation
of
the
throne
by
the
former
emperor
napoleon
they
felt
that
they
were
called
upon
to
eradicate
the
adherents
of
the
french
ideas
just
as
philip
ii
had
only
followed
the
voice
of
his
conscience
when
he
burned
protestants
or
hanged
moors
in
the
beginning
of
the
sixteenth
century
a
man
who
did
not
believe
in
the
divine
right
of
the
pope
to
rule
his
subjects
as
he
saw
fit
was
a
heretic
and
it
was
the
duty
of
all
loyal
citizens
to
kill
him
in
the
beginning
of
the
nineteenth
century
on
the
continent
of
europe
a
man
who
did
not
believe
in
the
divine
right
of
his
king
to
rule
him
as
he
or
his
prime
minister
saw
fit
was
a
heretic
and
it
was
the
duty
of
all
loyal
citizens
to
denounce
him
to
the
nearest
policeman
and
see
that
he
got
punished
but
the
rulers
of
the
year
had
learned
efficiency
in
the
school
of
napoleon
and
they
performed
their
task
much
better
than
it
had
been
done
in
the
year
the
period
between
the
year
and
the
year
was
the
great
era
of
the
political
spy
spies
were
everywhere
they
lived
in
palaces
and
they
were
to
be
found
in
the
lowest
they
peeped
through
the
of
the
ministerial
cabinet
and
they
listened
to
the
conversations
of
the
people
who
were
taking
the
air
on
the
benches
of
the
municipal
park
they
guarded
the
frontier
so
that
no
one
might
leave
without
a
duly
viseed
passport
and
they
inspected
all
packages
that
no
books
with
dangerous
french
ideas
should
enter
the
realm
of
their
royal
masters
they
sat
among
the
students
in
the
lecture
hall
and
woe
to
the
professor
who
uttered
a
word
against
the
existing
order
of
things
they
followed
the
little
boys
and
girls
on
their
way
to
church
lest
they
play
hookey
in
many
of
these
tasks
they
were
assisted
by
the
clergy
the
church
had
suffered
greatly
during
the
days
of
the
revolution
the
church
property
had
been
confiscated
several
priests
had
been
killed
and
the
generation
that
had
learned
its
cathechism
from
voltaire
and
rousseau
and
the
other
french
philosophers
had
danced
around
the
altar
of
reason
when
the
committee
of
public
safety
had
abolished
the
worship
of
god
in
october
of
the
year
the
priests
had
followed
the
emigres
into
their
long
exile
now
they
returned
in
the
wake
of
the
allied
armies
and
they
set
to
work
with
a
vengeance
even
the
jesuits
came
back
in
and
resumed
their
former
labours
of
educating
the
young
their
order
had
been
a
little
too
successful
in
its
fight
against
the
enemies
of
the
church
it
had
established
provinces
in
every
part
of
the
world
to
teach
the
natives
the
blessings
of
christianity
but
soon
it
had
developed
into
a
regular
trading
company
which
was
for
ever
interfering
with
the
civil
authorities
during
the
reign
of
the
marquis
de
pombal
the
great
reforming
minister
of
portugal
they
had
been
driven
out
of
the
portuguese
lands
and
in
the
year
at
the
request
of
most
of
the
catholic
powers
of
europe
the
order
had
been
suppressed
by
pope
clement
xiv
now
they
were
back
on
the
job
and
preached
the
principles
of
obedience
and
love
for
the
legitimate
dynasty
to
children
whose
parents
had
hired
shopwindows
that
they
might
laugh
at
marie
antoinette
driving
to
the
scaffold
which
was
to
end
her
misery
but
in
the
protestant
countries
like
prussia
things
were
not
a
whit
better
the
great
patriotic
leaders
of
the
year
the
poets
and
the
writers
who
had
preached
a
holy
war
upon
the
usurper
were
now
branded
as
dangerous
demagogues
their
houses
were
searched
their
letters
were
read
they
were
obliged
to
report
to
the
police
at
regular
intervals
and
give
an
account
of
themselves
the
prussian
drill
master
was
let
loose
in
all
his
fury
upon
the
younger
generation
when
a
party
of
students
celebrated
the
tercentenary
of
the
reformation
with
noisy
but
harmless
festivities
on
the
old
wartburg
the
prussian
bureaucrats
had
visions
of
an
imminent
revolution
when
a
theological
student
more
honest
than
intelligent
killed
a
russian
government
spy
who
was
operating
in
germany
the
universities
were
placed
under
and
professors
were
jailed
or
dismissed
without
any
form
of
trial
russia
of
course
was
even
more
absurd
in
these
activities
alexander
had
recovered
from
his
attack
of
piety
he
was
gradually
drifting
toward
melancholia
he
well
knew
his
own
limited
abilities
and
understood
how
at
vienna
he
had
been
the
victim
both
of
metternich
and
the
krudener
woman
more
and
more
he
turned
his
back
upon
the
west
and
became
a
truly
russian
ruler
whose
interests
lay
in
constantinople
the
old
holy
city
that
had
been
the
first
teacher
of
the
slavs
the
older
he
grew
the
harder
he
worked
and
the
less
he
was
able
to
accomplish
and
while
he
sat
in
his
study
his
ministers
turned
the
whole
of
russia
into
a
land
of
military
barracks
it
is
not
a
pretty
picture
perhaps
i
might
have
shortened
this
description
of
the
great
reaction
but
it
is
just
as
well
that
you
should
have
a
thorough
knowledge
of
this
era
it
was
not
the
first
time
that
an
attempt
had
been
made
to
set
the
clock
of
history
back
the
result
was
the
usual
one
national
independence
the
love
of
national
independence
however
was
too
strong
to
be
destroyed
in
this
way
the
south
americans
were
the
first
to
rebel
against
the
reactionary
measures
of
the
congress
of
vienna
greece
and
belgium
and
spain
and
a
large
number
of
other
countries
of
the
european
continent
followed
suit
and
the
nineteenth
century
was
filled
with
the
rumour
of
many
wars
of
independence
it
will
serve
no
good
purpose
to
say
if
only
the
congress
of
vienna
had
done
such
and
such
a
thing
instead
of
taking
such
and
such
a
course
the
history
of
europe
in
the
nineteenth
century
would
have
been
different
the
congress
of
vienna
was
a
gathering
of
men
who
had
just
passed
through
a
great
revolution
and
through
twenty
years
of
terrible
and
almost
continuous
warfare
they
came
together
for
the
purpose
of
giving
europe
that
peace
and
stability
which
they
thought
that
the
people
needed
and
wanted
they
were
what
we
call
reactionaries
they
sincerely
believed
in
the
inability
of
the
mass
of
the
people
to
rule
themselves
they
the
map
of
europe
in
such
a
way
as
seemed
to
promise
the
greatest
possibility
of
a
lasting
success
they
failed
but
not
through
any
premeditated
wickedness
on
their
part
they
were
for
the
greater
part
men
of
the
old
school
who
remembered
the
happier
days
of
their
quiet
youth
and
ardently
wished
a
return
of
that
blessed
period
they
failed
to
recognise
the
strong
hold
which
many
of
the
revolutionary
principles
had
gained
upon
the
people
of
the
european
continent
that
was
a
misfortune
but
hardly
a
sin
but
one
of
the
things
which
the
french
revolution
had
taught
not
only
europe
but
america
as
well
was
the
right
of
people
to
their
own
nationality
napoleon
who
respected
nothing
and
nobody
was
utterly
ruthless
in
his
dealing
with
national
and
patriotic
aspirations
but
the
early
revolutionary
generals
had
proclaimed
the
new
doctrine
that
nationality
was
not
a
matter
of
political
frontiers
or
round
skulls
and
broad
noses
but
a
matter
of
the
heart
and
soul
while
they
were
teaching
the
french
children
the
greatness
of
the
french
nation
they
encouraged
spaniards
and
hollanders
and
italians
to
do
the
same
thing
soon
these
people
who
all
shared
rousseau
belief
in
the
superior
virtues
of
original
man
began
to
dig
into
their
past
and
found
buried
beneath
the
ruins
of
the
feudal
system
the
bones
of
the
mighty
races
of
which
they
supposed
themselves
the
feeble
descendants
the
first
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
was
the
era
of
the
great
historical
discoveries
everywhere
historians
were
busy
publishing
mediaeval
charters
and
early
mediaeval
chronicles
and
in
every
country
the
result
was
a
new
pride
in
the
old
fatherland
a
great
deal
of
this
sentiment
was
based
upon
the
wrong
interpretation
of
historical
facts
but
in
practical
politics
it
does
not
matter
what
is
true
but
everything
depends
upon
what
the
people
believe
to
be
true
and
in
most
countries
both
the
kings
and
their
subjects
firmly
believed
in
the
glory
and
fame
of
their
ancestors
the
congress
of
vienna
was
not
inclined
to
be
sentimental
their
excellencies
divided
the
map
of
europe
according
to
the
best
interests
of
half
a
dozen
dynasties
and
put
national
aspirations
upon
the
index
or
list
of
forbidden
books
together
with
all
other
dangerous
french
doctrines
but
history
is
no
respecter
of
congresses
for
some
reason
or
other
it
may
be
an
historical
law
which
thus
far
has
escaped
the
attention
of
the
scholars
nations
seemed
to
be
necessary
for
the
orderly
development
of
human
society
and
the
attempt
to
stem
this
tide
was
quite
as
unsuccessful
as
the
metternichian
effort
to
prevent
people
from
thinking
curiously
enough
the
first
trouble
began
in
a
very
distant
part
of
the
world
in
south
america
the
spanish
colonies
of
that
continent
had
been
enjoying
a
period
of
relative
independence
during
the
many
years
of
the
great
napoleonic
wars
they
had
even
remained
faithful
to
their
king
when
he
was
taken
prisoner
by
the
french
emperor
and
they
had
refused
to
recognise
joseph
bonaparte
who
had
in
the
year
been
made
king
of
spain
by
order
of
his
brother
indeed
the
only
part
of
america
to
get
very
much
upset
by
the
revolution
was
the
island
of
haiti
the
espagnola
of
columbus
first
trip
here
in
the
year
the
french
convention
in
a
sudden
outburst
of
love
and
human
brotherhood
had
bestowed
upon
their
black
brethren
all
the
privileges
hitherto
enjoyed
by
their
white
masters
just
as
suddenly
they
had
repented
of
this
step
but
the
attempt
to
undo
the
original
promise
led
to
many
years
of
terrible
warfare
between
general
leclerc
the
of
napoleon
and
toussaint
the
negro
chieftain
in
the
year
toussaint
was
asked
to
visit
leclerc
and
discuss
terms
of
peace
he
received
the
solemn
promise
that
he
would
not
be
molested
he
trusted
his
white
adversaries
was
put
on
board
a
ship
and
shortly
afterwards
died
in
a
french
prison
but
the
negroes
gained
their
independence
all
the
same
and
founded
a
republic
incidentally
they
were
of
great
help
to
the
first
great
south
american
patriot
in
his
efforts
to
deliver
his
native
country
from
the
spanish
yoke
simon
bolivar
a
native
of
caracas
in
venezuela
born
in
the
year
had
been
educated
in
spain
had
visited
paris
where
he
had
seen
the
revolutionary
government
at
work
had
lived
for
a
while
in
the
united
states
and
had
returned
to
his
native
land
where
the
widespread
discontent
against
spain
the
mother
country
was
beginning
to
take
a
definite
form
in
the
year
venezuela
declared
its
independence
and
bolivar
became
one
of
the
revolutionary
generals
within
two
months
the
rebels
were
defeated
and
bolivar
fled
for
the
next
five
years
he
was
the
leader
of
an
apparently
lost
cause
he
sacrificed
all
his
wealth
and
he
would
not
have
been
able
to
begin
his
final
and
successful
expedition
without
the
support
of
the
president
of
haiti
thereafter
the
revolt
spread
all
over
south
america
and
soon
it
appeared
that
spain
was
not
able
to
suppress
the
rebellion
unaided
she
asked
for
the
support
of
the
holy
alliance
this
step
greatly
worried
england
the
british
shippers
had
succeeded
the
dutch
as
the
common
carriers
of
the
world
and
they
expected
to
reap
heavy
profits
from
a
declaration
of
independence
on
the
part
of
all
south
america
they
had
hopes
that
the
united
states
of
america
would
interfere
but
the
senate
had
no
such
plans
and
in
the
house
too
there
were
many
voices
which
declared
that
spain
ought
to
be
given
a
free
hand
just
then
there
was
a
change
of
ministers
in
england
the
whigs
went
out
and
the
tories
came
in
george
canning
became
secretary
of
state
he
dropped
a
hint
that
england
would
gladly
back
up
the
american
government
with
all
the
might
of
her
fleet
if
said
government
would
declare
its
disapproval
of
the
plans
of
the
holy
alliance
in
regard
to
the
rebellious
colonies
of
the
southern
continent
president
monroe
thereupon
on
the
of
december
of
the
year
addressed
congress
and
stated
that
america
would
consider
any
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
allied
powers
to
extend
their
system
to
any
portion
of
this
western
hemisphere
as
dangerous
to
our
peace
and
safety
and
gave
warning
that
the
american
government
would
consider
such
action
on
the
part
of
the
holy
alliance
as
a
manifestation
of
an
unfriendly
disposition
toward
the
united
states
four
weeks
later
the
text
of
the
monroe
doctrine
was
printed
in
the
english
newspapers
and
the
members
of
the
holy
alliance
were
forced
to
make
their
choice
metternich
hesitated
personally
he
would
have
been
willing
to
risk
the
displeasure
of
the
united
states
which
had
allowed
both
its
army
and
navy
to
fall
into
neglect
since
the
end
of
the
war
of
the
year
but
canning
threatening
attitude
and
trouble
on
the
continent
forced
him
to
be
careful
the
expedition
never
took
place
and
south
america
and
mexico
gained
their
independence
as
for
the
troubles
on
the
continent
of
europe
they
were
coming
fast
and
furious
the
holy
alliance
had
sent
french
troops
to
spain
to
act
as
guardians
of
the
peace
in
the
year
austrian
troops
had
been
used
for
a
similar
purpose
in
italy
when
the
carbonari
the
secret
society
of
the
charcoal
burners
were
making
propaganda
for
a
united
italy
and
had
caused
a
rebellion
against
the
unspeakable
ferdinand
of
naples
bad
news
also
came
from
russia
where
the
death
of
alexander
had
been
the
sign
for
a
revolutionary
outbreak
in
petersburg
a
short
but
bloody
upheaval
the
dekaberist
revolt
because
it
took
place
in
december
which
ended
with
the
hanging
of
a
large
number
of
good
patriots
who
had
been
disgusted
by
the
reaction
of
alexander
last
years
and
had
tried
to
give
russia
a
constitutional
form
of
government
but
worse
was
to
follow
metternich
had
tried
to
assure
himself
of
the
continued
support
of
the
european
courts
by
a
series
of
conferences
at
at
troppau
at
laibach
and
finally
at
verona
the
delegates
from
the
different
powers
duly
travelled
to
these
agreeable
watering
places
where
the
austrian
prime
minister
used
to
spend
his
summers
they
always
promised
to
do
their
best
to
suppress
revolt
but
they
were
none
too
certain
of
their
success
the
spirit
of
the
people
was
beginning
to
be
ugly
and
especially
in
france
the
position
of
the
king
was
by
no
means
satisfactory
the
real
trouble
however
began
in
the
balkans
the
gateway
to
western
europe
through
which
the
invaders
of
that
continent
had
passed
since
the
beginning
of
time
the
first
outbreak
was
in
moldavia
the
ancient
roman
province
of
dacia
which
had
been
cut
off
from
the
empire
in
the
third
century
since
then
it
had
been
a
lost
land
a
sort
of
atlantis
where
the
people
had
continued
to
speak
the
old
roman
tongue
and
still
called
themselves
romans
and
their
country
roumania
here
in
the
year
a
young
greek
prince
alexander
ypsilanti
began
a
revolt
against
the
turks
he
told
his
followers
that
they
could
count
upon
the
support
of
russia
but
metternich
fast
couriers
were
soon
on
their
way
to
st
petersburg
and
the
tsar
entirely
persuaded
by
the
austrian
arguments
in
favor
of
peace
and
stability
refused
to
help
ypsilanti
was
forced
to
flee
to
austria
where
he
spent
the
next
seven
years
in
prison
in
the
same
year
trouble
began
in
greece
since
a
secret
society
of
greek
patriots
had
been
preparing
the
way
for
a
revolt
suddenly
they
hoisted
the
flag
of
independence
in
the
morea
the
ancient
peloponnesus
and
drove
the
turkish
garrisons
away
the
turks
answered
in
the
usual
fashion
they
took
the
greek
patriarch
of
constantinople
who
was
regarded
as
their
pope
both
by
the
greeks
and
by
many
russians
and
they
hanged
him
on
easter
sunday
of
the
year
together
with
a
number
of
his
bishops
the
greeks
came
back
with
a
massacre
of
all
the
mohammedans
in
tripolitsa
the
capital
of
the
morea
and
the
turks
retaliated
by
an
attack
upon
the
island
of
chios
where
they
murdered
christians
and
sold
others
as
slaves
into
asia
and
egypt
then
the
greeks
appealed
to
the
european
courts
but
metternich
told
them
in
so
many
words
that
they
could
stew
in
their
own
grease
i
am
not
trying
to
make
a
pun
but
i
am
quoting
his
serene
highness
who
informed
the
tsar
that
this
fire
of
revolt
ought
to
burn
itself
out
beyond
the
pale
of
civilisation
and
the
frontiers
were
closed
to
those
volunteers
who
wished
to
go
to
the
rescue
of
the
patriotic
hellenes
their
cause
seemed
lost
at
the
request
of
turkey
an
egyptian
army
was
landed
in
the
morea
and
soon
the
turkish
flag
was
again
flying
from
the
acropolis
the
ancient
stronghold
of
athens
the
egyptian
army
then
pacified
the
country
a
la
turque
and
metternich
followed
the
proceedings
with
quiet
interest
awaiting
the
day
when
this
attempt
against
the
peace
of
europe
should
be
a
thing
of
the
past
once
more
it
was
england
which
upset
his
plans
the
greatest
glory
of
england
does
not
lie
in
her
vast
colonial
possessions
in
her
wealth
or
her
navy
but
in
the
quiet
heroism
and
independence
of
her
average
citizen
the
englishman
obeys
the
law
because
he
knows
that
respect
for
the
rights
of
others
marks
the
difference
between
a
and
civilised
society
but
he
does
not
recognize
the
right
of
others
to
interfere
with
his
freedom
of
thought
if
his
country
does
something
which
he
believes
to
be
wrong
he
gets
up
and
says
so
and
the
government
which
he
attacks
will
respect
him
and
will
give
him
full
protection
against
the
mob
which
as
in
the
time
of
socrates
often
loves
to
destroy
those
who
surpass
it
in
courage
or
intelligence
there
never
has
been
a
good
cause
however
unpopular
or
however
distant
which
has
not
counted
a
number
of
englishmen
among
its
staunchest
adherents
the
mass
of
the
english
people
are
not
different
from
those
in
other
lands
they
stick
to
the
business
at
hand
and
have
no
time
for
unpractical
sporting
ventures
but
they
rather
admire
their
eccentric
neighbour
who
drops
everything
to
go
and
fight
for
some
obscure
people
in
asia
or
africa
and
when
he
has
been
killed
they
give
him
a
fine
public
funeral
and
hold
him
up
to
their
children
as
an
example
of
valor
and
chivalry
even
the
police
spies
of
the
holy
alliance
were
powerless
against
this
national
characteristic
in
the
year
lord
byron
a
rich
young
englishman
who
wrote
the
poetry
over
which
all
europe
wept
hoisted
the
sails
of
his
yacht
and
started
south
to
help
the
greeks
three
months
later
the
news
spread
through
europe
that
their
hero
lay
dead
in
missolonghi
the
last
of
the
greek
strongholds
his
lonely
death
caught
the
imagination
of
the
people
in
all
countries
societies
were
formed
to
help
the
greeks
lafayette
the
grand
old
man
of
the
american
revolution
pleaded
their
cause
in
france
the
king
of
bavaria
sent
hundreds
of
his
officers
money
and
supplies
poured
in
upon
the
starving
men
of
missolonghi
in
england
george
canning
who
had
defeated
the
plans
of
the
holy
alliance
in
south
america
was
now
prime
he
saw
his
chance
to
checkmate
metternich
for
a
second
time
the
english
and
russian
fleets
were
already
in
the
mediterranean
they
were
sent
by
governments
which
dared
no
longer
suppress
the
popular
enthusiasm
for
the
cause
of
the
greek
patriots
the
french
navy
appeared
because
france
since
the
end
of
the
crusades
had
assumed
the
role
of
the
defender
of
the
christian
faith
in
mohammedan
lands
on
october
of
the
year
the
ships
of
the
three
nations
attacked
the
turkish
fleet
in
the
bay
of
navarino
and
destroyed
it
rarely
has
the
news
of
a
battle
been
received
with
such
general
rejoicing
the
people
of
western
europe
and
russia
who
enjoyed
no
freedom
at
home
consoled
themselves
by
fighting
an
imaginary
war
of
liberty
on
behalf
of
the
oppressed
greeks
in
the
year
they
had
their
reward
greece
became
an
independent
nation
and
the
policy
of
reaction
and
stability
suffered
its
second
great
defeat
it
would
be
absurd
were
i
to
try
in
this
short
volume
to
give
you
a
detailed
account
of
the
struggle
for
national
independence
in
all
other
countries
there
are
a
large
number
of
excellent
books
devoted
to
such
subjects
i
have
described
the
struggle
for
the
independence
of
greece
because
it
was
the
first
successful
attack
upon
the
bulwark
of
reaction
which
the
congress
of
vienna
had
erected
to
maintain
the
stability
of
europe
that
mighty
fortress
of
suppression
still
held
out
and
metternich
continued
to
be
in
command
but
the
end
was
near
in
france
the
bourbons
had
established
an
almost
unbearable
rule
of
police
officials
who
were
trying
to
undo
the
work
of
the
french
revolution
with
an
absolute
disregard
of
the
regulations
and
laws
of
civilised
warfare
when
louis
xviii
died
in
the
year
the
people
had
enjoyed
nine
years
of
peace
which
had
proved
even
more
unhappy
than
the
ten
years
of
war
of
the
empire
louis
was
succeeded
by
his
brother
charles
louis
had
belonged
to
that
famous
bourbon
family
which
although
it
never
learned
anything
never
forgot
anything
the
recollection
of
that
morning
in
the
town
of
hamm
when
news
had
reached
him
of
the
decapitation
of
his
brother
remained
a
constant
warning
of
what
might
happen
to
those
kings
who
did
not
read
the
signs
of
the
times
aright
charles
on
the
other
hand
who
had
managed
to
run
up
private
debts
of
fifty
million
francs
before
he
was
twenty
years
of
age
knew
nothing
remembered
nothing
and
firmly
intended
to
learn
nothing
as
soon
as
he
had
succeeded
his
brother
he
established
a
government
by
priests
through
priests
and
for
priests
and
while
the
duke
of
wellington
who
made
this
remark
can
not
be
called
a
violent
liberal
charles
ruled
in
such
a
way
that
he
disgusted
even
that
trusted
friend
of
law
and
order
when
he
tried
to
suppress
the
newspapers
which
dared
to
criticise
his
government
and
dismissed
the
parliament
because
it
supported
the
press
his
days
were
numbered
on
the
night
of
the
of
july
of
the
year
a
revolution
took
place
in
paris
on
the
of
the
same
month
the
king
fled
to
the
coast
and
set
sail
for
england
in
this
way
the
famous
farce
of
fifteen
years
came
to
an
end
and
the
bourbons
were
at
last
removed
from
the
throne
of
france
they
were
too
hopelessly
incompetent
france
then
might
have
returned
to
a
republican
form
of
government
but
such
a
step
would
not
have
been
tolerated
by
metternich
the
situation
was
dangerous
enough
the
spark
of
rebellion
had
leaped
beyond
the
french
frontier
and
had
set
fire
to
another
powder
house
filled
with
national
grievances
the
new
kingdom
of
the
netherlands
had
not
been
a
success
the
belgian
and
the
dutch
people
had
nothing
in
common
and
their
king
william
of
orange
the
descendant
of
an
uncle
of
william
the
silent
while
a
hard
worker
and
a
good
business
man
was
too
much
lacking
in
tact
and
pliability
to
keep
the
peace
among
his
uncongenial
subjects
besides
the
horde
of
priests
which
had
descended
upon
france
had
at
once
found
its
way
into
belgium
and
whatever
protestant
william
tried
to
do
was
howled
down
by
large
crowds
of

travelled
slowly
but
when
the
success
of
the
french
and
the
belgian
revolutionists
became
known
in
poland
there
was
an
immediate
clash
between
the
poles
and
their
russian
rulers
which
led
to
a
year
of
terrible
warfare
and
ended
with

and
the
thousands
of

refugees
who
had
found

bore
witness
to
the
fact
that
the
principles
of
the
holy
alliance
were
still
more
than
a
hollow
phrase
in
holy
russia
in
italy
too
there
was
a
moment
of
unrest
marie
louise
duchess
of
parma
and
wife
of
the
former
emperor
napoleon
whom
she
had
deserted
after
the
defeat
of
waterloo
was
driven
away
from
her
country
and
in
the
papal
state
the
exasperated
people
tried
to
establish
an
independent
republic
but
the
armies
of
austria
marched
to
rome
and
soon
every
thing
was
as
of
old
metternich
continued
to
reside
at
the
ball
platz
the
home
of
the
foreign
minister
of
the
habsburg
dynasty
the
police
spies
returned
to
their
job
and
peace
reigned
supreme
eighteen
more
years
were
to
pass
before
a
second
and
more
successful
attempt
could
be
made
to
deliver
europe
from
the
terrible
inheritance
of
the
vienna
congress
again
it
was
france
the
revolutionary
of
europe
which
gave
the
signal
of
revolt
charles
x
had
been
succeeded
by
louis
philippe
the
son
of
that
famous
duke
of
orleans
who
had
turned
jacobin
had
voted
for
the
death
of
his
cousin
the
king
and
had
played
a
role
during
the
early
days
of
the
revolution
under
the
name
of
philippe
egalite
or
equality
philip
eventually
he
had
been
killed
when
robespierre
tried
to
purge
the
nation
of
all
traitors
by
which
name
he
indicated
those
people
who
did
not
share
his
own
views
and
his
son
had
been
forced
to
run
away
from
the
revolutionary
army
young
louis
philippe
thereupon
had
wandered
far
and
wide
he
had
taught
school
in
switzerland
and
had
spent
a
couple
of
years
exploring
the
unknown
far
west
of
america
after
the
fall
of
napoleon
he
had
returned
to
paris
he
was
much
more
intelligent
than
his
bourbon
cousins
he
was
a
simple
man
who
went
about
in
the
public
parks
with
a
red
cotton
umbrella
under
his
arm
followed
by
a
brood
of
children
like
any
good
housefather
but
france
had
outgrown
the
king
business
and
louis
did
not
know
this
until
the
morning
of
the
of
february
of
the
year
when
a
crowd
stormed
the
tuilleries
and
drove
his
majesty
away
and
proclaimed
the
republic
when
the
news
of
this
event
reached
vienna
metternich
expressed
the
casual
opinion
that
this
was
only
a
repetition
of
the
year
and
that
the
allies
would
once
more
be
obliged
to
march
upon
paris
and
make
an
end
to
this
very
unseemly
democratic
row
but
two
weeks
later
his
own
austrian
capital
was
in
open
revolt
metternich
escaped
from
the
mob
through
the
back
door
of
his
palace
and
the
emperor
ferdinand
was
forced
to
give
his
subjects
a
constitution
which
embodied
most
of
the
revolutionary
principles
which
his
prime
minister
had
tried
to
suppress
for
the
last
years
this
time
all
europe
felt
the
shock
hungary
declared
itself
independent
and
commenced
a
war
against
the
habsburgs
under
the
leadership
of
louis
kossuth
the
unequal
struggle
lasted
more
than
a
year
it
was
finally
suppressed
by
the
armies
of
tsar
nicholas
who
marched
across
the
carpathian
mountains
and
made
hungary
once
more
safe
for
autocracy
the
habsburgs
thereupon
established
extraordinary
and
hanged
the
greater
part
of
the
hungarian
patriots
whom
they
had
not
been
able
to
defeat
in
open
battle
as
for
italy
the
island
of
sicily
declared
itself
independent
from
naples
and
drove
its
bourbon
king
away
in
the
papal
states
the
prime
minister
rossi
was
murdered
and
the
pope
was
forced
to
flee
he
returned
the
next
year
at
the
head
of
a
french
army
which
remained
in
rome
to
protect
his
holiness
against
his
subjects
until
the
year
then
it
was
called
back
to
defend
france
against
the
prussians
and
rome
became
the
capital
of
italy
in
the
north
milan
and
venice
rose
against
their
austrian
masters
they
were
supported
by
king
albert
of
sardinia
but
a
strong
austrian
army
under
old
radetzky
marched
into
the
valley
of
the
po
defeated
the
sardinians
near
custozza
and
novara
and
forced
albert
to
abdicate
in
favour
of
his
son
victor
emanuel
who
a
few
years
later
was
to
be
the
first
king
of
a
united
italy
in
germany
the
unrest
of
the
year
took
the
form
of
a
great
national
demonstration
in
favour
of
political
unity
and
a
representative
form
of
government
in
bavaria
the
king
who
had
wasted
his
time
and
money
upon
an
irish
lady
who
posed
as
a
spanish
dancer
she
was
called
lola
montez
and
lies
buried
in
new
york
potter
field
was
driven
away
by
the
enraged
students
of
the
university
in
prussia
the
king
was
forced
to
stand
with
uncovered
head
before
the
coffins
of
those
who
had
been
killed
during
the
street
fighting
and
to
promise
a
constitutional
form
of
government
and
in
march
of
the
year
a
german
parliament
consisting
of
delegates
from
all
parts
of
the
country
came
together
in
frankfort
and
proposed
that
king
frederick
william
of
prussia
should
be
the
emperor
of
a
united
germany
then
however
the
tide
began
to
turn
incompetent
ferdinand
had
abdicated
in
favour
of
his
nephew
francis
joseph
the
austrian
army
had
remained
faithful
to
their
the
hangman
was
given
plenty
of
work
and
the
habsburgs
after
the
nature
of
that
strangely
family
once
more
landed
upon
their
feet
and
rapidly
strengthened
their
position
as
the
masters
of
eastern
and
western
europe
they
played
the
game
of
politics
very
adroitly
and
used
the
jealousies
of
the
other
german
states
to
prevent
the
elevation
of
the
prussian
king
to
the
imperial
dignity
their
long
in
the
art
of
suffering
defeat
had
taught
them
the
value
of
patience
they
knew
how
to
wait
they
bided
their
time
and
while
the
liberals
utterly
untrained
in
practical
politics
talked
and
talked
and
talked
and
got
intoxicated
by
their
own
fine
speeches
the
austrians
quietly
gathered
their
forces
dismissed
the
parliament
of
frankfort
and
the
old
and
impossible
german
confederation
which
the
congress
of
vienna
had
wished
upon
an
unsuspecting
world
but
among
the
men
who
had
attended
this
strange
parliament
of
unpractical
enthusiasts
there
was
a
prussian
country
squire
by
the
name
of
bismarck
who
had
made
good
use
of
his
eyes
and
ears
he
had
a
deep
contempt
for
oratory
he
knew
what
every
man
of
action
has
always
known
that
nothing
is
ever
accomplished
by
talk
in
his
own
way
he
was
a
sincere
patriot
he
had
been
trained
in
the
old
school
of
diplomacy
and
he
could
outlie
his
opponents
just
as
he
could
outwalk
them
and
outdrink
them
and
outride
them
bismarck
felt
convinced
that
the
loose
confederation
of
little
states
must
be
changed
into
a
strong
united
country
if
it
would
hold
its
own
against
the
other
european
powers
brought
up
amidst
feudal
ideas
of
loyalty
he
decided
that
the
house
of
hohenzollern
of
which
he
was
the
most
faithful
servant
should
rule
the
new
state
rather
than
the
incompetent
habsburgs
for
this
purpose
he
must
first
get
rid
of
the
austrian
influence
and
he
began
to
make
the
necessary
preparations
for
this
painful
operation
italy
in
the
meantime
had
solved
her
own
problem
and
had
rid
herself
of
her
hated
austrian
master
the
unity
of
italy
was
the
work
of
three
men
cavour
mazzini
and
garibaldi
of
these
three
cavour
the
with
the
eyes
and
the
glasses
played
the
part
of
the
careful
political
pilot
mazzini
who
had
spent
most
of
his
days
in
different
european
garrets
hiding
from
the
austrian
police
was
the
public
agitator
while
garibaldi
with
his
band
of
appealed
to
the
popular
imagination
mazzini
and
garibaldi
were
both
believers
in
the
republican
form
of
government
cavour
however
was
a
monarchist
and
the
others
who
recognised
his
superior
ability
in
such
matters
of
practical
statecraft
accepted
his
decision
and
sacrificed
their
own
ambitions
for
the
greater
good
of
their
beloved
fatherland
cavour
felt
towards
the
house
of
sardinia
as
bismarck
did
towards
the
hohenzollern
family
with
infinite
care
and
great
shrewdness
he
set
to
work
to
jockey
the
sardinian
king
into
a
position
from
which
his
majesty
would
be
able
to
assume
the
leadership
of
the
entire
italian
people
the
unsettled
political
conditions
in
the
rest
of
europe
greatly
helped
him
in
his
plans
and
no
country
contributed
more
to
the
independence
of
italy
than
her
old
and
trusted
and
often
distrusted
neighbour
france
in
that
turbulent
country
in
november
of
the
year
the
republic
had
come
to
a
sudden
but
not
unexpected
end
napoleon
iii
the
son
of
louis
bonaparte
the
former
king
of
holland
and
the
small
nephew
of
a
great
uncle
had
an
empire
and
had
made
himself
emperor
by
the
grace
of
god
and
the
will
of
the
people
this
young
man
who
had
been
educated
in
germany
and
who
mixed
his
french
with
harsh
teutonic
gutturals
just
as
the
first
napoleon
had
always
spoken
the
language
of
his
adopted
country
with
a
strong
italian
accent
was
trying
very
hard
to
use
the
napoleonic
tradition
for
his
own
benefit
but
he
had
many
enemies
and
did
not
feel
very
certain
of
his
hold
upon
his
throne
he
had
gained
the
friendship
of
queen
victoria
but
this
had
not
been
a
difficult
task
as
the
good
queen
was
not
particularly
brilliant
and
was
very
susceptible
to
flattery
as
for
the
other
european
sovereigns
they
treated
the
french
emperor
with
insulting
haughtiness
and
sat
up
nights
devising
new
ways
in
which
they
could
show
their
upstart
good
brother
how
sincerely
they
despised
him
napoleon
was
obliged
to
find
a
way
in
which
he
could
break
this
opposition
either
through
love
or
through
fear
he
well
knew
the
fascination
which
the
word
glory
still
held
for
his
subjects
since
he
was
forced
to
gamble
for
his
throne
he
decided
to
play
the
game
of
empire
for
high
stakes
he
used
an
attack
of
russia
upon
turkey
as
an
excuse
for
bringing
about
the
crimean
war
in
which
england
and
france
combined
against
the
tsar
on
behalf
of
the
sultan
it
was
a
very
costly
and
exceedingly
unprofitable
enterprise
neither
france
nor
england
nor
russia
reaped
much
glory
but
the
crimean
war
did
one
good
thing
it
gave
sardinia
a
chance
to
volunteer
on
the
winning
side
and
when
peace
was
declared
it
gave
cavour
the
opportunity
to
lay
claim
to
the
gratitude
of
both
england
and
france
having
made
use
of
the
international
situation
to
get
sardinia
recognised
as
one
of
the
more
important
powers
of
europe
the
clever
italian
then
provoked
a
war
between
sardinia
and
austria
in
june
of
the
year
he
assured
himself
of
the
support
of
napoleon
in
exchange
for
the
provinces
of
savoy
and
the
city
of
nice
which
was
really
an
italian
town
the
armies
defeated
the
austrians
at
magenta
and
solferino
and
the
former
austrian
provinces
and
duchies
were
united
into
a
single
italian
kingdom
florence
became
the
capital
of
this
new
italy
until
the
year
when
the
french
recalled
their
troops
from
home
to
defend
france
against
the
germans
as
soon
as
they
were
gone
the
italian
troops
entered
the
eternal
city
and
the
house
of
sardinia
took
up
its
residence
in
the
old
palace
of
the
quirinal
which
an
ancient
pope
had
built
on
the
ruins
of
the
baths
of
the
emperor
constantine
the
pope
however
moved
across
the
river
tiber
and
hid
behind
the
walls
of
the
vatican
which
had
been
the
home
of
many
of
his
predecessors
since
their
return
from
the
exile
of
avignon
in
the
year
he
protested
loudly
against
this
theft
of
his
domains
and
addressed
letters
of
appeal
to
those
faithful
catholics
who
were
inclined
to
sympathise
with
him
in
his
loss
their
number
however
was
small
and
it
has
been
steadily
decreasing
for
once
delivered
from
the
cares
of
state
the
pope
was
able
to
devote
all
his
time
to
questions
of
a
spiritual
nature
standing
high
above
the
petty
quarrels
of
the
european
politicians
the
papacy
assumed
a
new
dignity
which
proved
of
great
benefit
to
the
church
and
made
it
an
international
power
for
social
and
religious
progress
which
has
shown
a
much
more
intelligent
appreciation
of
modern
economic
problems
than
most
protestant
sects
in
this
way
the
attempt
of
the
congress
of
vienna
to
settle
the
italian
question
by
making
the
peninsula
an
austrian
province
was
at
last
undone
the
german
problem
however
remained
as
yet
unsolved
it
proved
the
most
difficult
of
all
the
failure
of
the
revolution
of
the
year
had
led
to
the
wholesale
migration
of
the
more
energetic
and
liberal
elements
among
the
german
people
these
young
fellows
had
moved
to
the
united
states
of
america
to
brazil
to
the
new
colonies
in
asia
and
america
their
work
was
continued
in
germany
but
by
a
different
sort
of
men
in
the
new
diet
which
met
at
frankfort
after
the
collapse
of
the
german
parliament
and
the
failure
of
the
liberals
to
establish
a
united
country
the
kingdom
of
prussia
was
represented
by
that
same
otto
von
bismarck
from
whom
we
parted
a
few
pages
ago
bismarck
by
now
had
managed
to
gain
the
complete
confidence
of
the
king
of
prussia
that
was
all
he
asked
for
the
opinion
of
the
prussian
parliament
or
of
the
prussian
people
interested
him
not
at
all
with
his
own
eyes
he
had
seen
the
defeat
of
the
liberals
he
knew
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
get
rid
of
austria
without
a
war
and
he
began
by
strengthening
the
prussian
army
the
landtag
exasperated
at
his
methods
refused
to
give
him
the
necessary
credits
bismarck
did
not
even
bother
to
discuss
the
matter
he
went
ahead
and
increased
his
army
with
the
help
of
funds
which
the
prussian
house
of
peers
and
the
king
placed
at
his
disposal
then
he
looked
for
a
national
cause
which
could
be
used
for
the
purpose
of
creating
a
great
wave
of
patriotism
among
all
the
german
people
in
the
north
of
germany
there
were
the
duchies
of
schleswig
and
holstein
which
ever
since
the
middle
ages
had
been
a
source
of
trouble
both
countries
were
inhabited
by
a
certain
number
of
danes
and
a
certain
number
of
germans
but
although
they
were
governed
by
the
king
of
denmark
they
were
not
an
integral
part
of
the
danish
state
and
this
led
to
endless
difficulties
heaven
forbid
that
i
should
revive
this
forgotten
question
which
now
seems
settled
by
the
acts
of
the
recent
congress
of
versailles
but
the
germans
in
holstein
were
very
loud
in
their
abuse
of
the
danes
and
the
danes
in
schleswig
made
a
great
ado
of
their
danishness
and
all
europe
was
discussing
the
problem
and
german
mannerchors
and
turnvereins
listened
to
sentimental
speeches
about
the
lost
brethren
and
the
different
chancelleries
were
trying
to
discover
what
it
was
all
about
when
prussia
mobilised
her
armies
to
save
the
lost
provinces
as
austria
the
official
head
of
the
german
confederation
could
not
allow
prussia
to
act
alone
in
such
an
important
matter
the
habsburg
troops
were
mobilised
too
and
the
combined
armies
of
the
two
great
powers
crossed
the
danish
frontiers
and
after
a
very
brave
resistance
on
the
part
of
the
danes
occupied
the
two
duchies
the
danes
appealed
to
europe
but
europe
was
otherwise
engaged
and
the
poor
danes
were
left
to
their
fate
bismarck
then
prepared
the
scene
for
the
second
number
upon
his
imperial
programme
he
used
the
division
of
the
spoils
to
pick
a
quarrel
with
austria
the
habsburgs
fell
into
the
trap
the
new
prussian
army
the
creation
of
bismarck
and
his
faithful
generals
invaded
bohemia
and
in
less
than
six
weeks
the
last
of
the
austrian
troops
had
been
destroyed
at
koniggratz
and
sadowa
and
the
road
to
vienna
lay
open
but
bismarck
did
not
want
to
go
too
far
he
knew
that
he
would
need
a
few
friends
in
europe
he
offered
the
defeated
habsburgs
very
decent
terms
of
peace
provided
they
would
resign
their
chairmanship
of
the
confederation
he
was
less
merciful
to
many
of
the
smaller
german
states
who
had
taken
the
side
of
the
austrians
and
annexed
them
to
prussia
the
greater
part
of
the
northern
states
then
formed
a
new
organisation
the
north
german
confederacy
and
victorious
prussia
assumed
the
unofficial
leadership
of
the
german
people
europe
stood
aghast
at
the
rapidity
with
which
the
work
of
consolidation
had
been
done
england
was
quite
indifferent
but
france
showed
signs
of
disapproval
napoleon
hold
upon
the
french
people
was
steadily
diminishing
the
crimean
war
had
been
costly
and
had
accomplished
nothing
a
second
adventure
in
the
year
when
a
french
army
had
tried
to
force
an
austrian
by
the
name
of
maximilian
upon
the
mexican
people
as
their
emperor
had
come
to
a
disastrous
end
as
soon
as
the
american
civil
war
had
been
won
by
the
north
for
the
government
at
washington
had
forced
the
french
to
withdraw
their
troops
and
this
had
given
the
mexicans
a
chance
to
clear
their
country
of
the
enemy
and
shoot
the
unwelcome
emperor
it
was
necessary
to
give
the
napoleonic
throne
a
new
coat
of
within
a
few
years
the
north
german
confederation
would
be
a
serious
rival
of
france
napoleon
decided
that
a
war
with
germany
would
be
a
good
thing
for
his
dynasty
he
looked
for
an
excuse
and
spain
the
poor
victim
of
endless
revolutions
gave
him
one
just
then
the
spanish
throne
happened
to
be
vacant
it
had
been
offered
to
the
catholic
branch
of
the
house
of
hohenzollern
the
french
government
had
objected
and
the
hohenzollerns
had
politely
refused
to
accept
the
crown
but
napoleon
who
was
showing
signs
of
illness
was
very
much
under
the
influence
of
his
beautiful
wife
eugenie
de
montijo
the
daughter
of
a
spanish
gentleman
and
the
of
william
kirkpatrick
an
american
consul
at
malaga
where
the
grapes
come
from
eugenie
although
shrewd
enough
was
as
badly
educated
as
most
spanish
women
of
that
day
she
was
at
the
mercy
of
her
spiritual
advisers
and
these
worthy
gentlemen
felt
no
love
for
the
protestant
king
of
prussia
be
bold
was
the
advice
of
the
empress
to
her
husband
but
she
omitted
to
add
the
second
half
of
that
famous
persian
proverb
which
admonishes
the
hero
to
be
bold
but
not
too
bold
napoleon
convinced
of
the
strength
of
his
army
addressed
himself
to
the
king
of
prussia
and
insisted
that
the
king
give
him
assurances
that
he
would
never
permit
another
candidature
of
a
hohenzollern
prince
to
the
spanish
crown
as
the
hohenzollerns
had
just
declined
the
honour
the
demand
was
superfluous
and
bismarck
so
informed
the
french
government
but
napoleon
was
not
satisfied
it
was
the
year
and
king
william
was
taking
the
waters
at
ems
there
one
day
he
was
approached
by
the
french
minister
who
tried
to
the
discussion
the
king
answered
very
pleasantly
that
it
was
a
fine
day
and
that
the
spanish
question
was
now
closed
and
that
nothing
more
remained
to
be
said
upon
the
subject
as
a
matter
of
routine
a
report
of
this
interview
was
telegraphed
to
bismarck
who
handled
all
foreign
affairs
bismarck
edited
the
dispatch
for
the
benefit
of
the
prussian
and
french
press
many
people
have
called
him
names
for
doing
this
bismarck
however
could
plead
the
excuse
that
the
doctoring
of
official
news
since
time
immemorial
had
been
one
of
the
privileges
of
all
civilised
governments
when
the
edited
telegram
was
printed
the
good
people
in
berlin
felt
that
their
old
and
venerable
king
with
his
nice
white
whiskers
had
been
insulted
by
an
arrogant
little
frenchman
and
the
equally
good
people
of
paris
flew
into
a
rage
because
their
perfectly
courteous
minister
had
been
shown
the
door
by
a
royal
prussian
flunkey
and
so
they
both
went
to
war
and
in
less
than
two
months
napoleon
and
the
greater
part
of
his
army
were
prisoners
of
the
germans
the
second
empire
had
come
to
an
end
and
the
third
republic
was
making
ready
to
defend
paris
against
the
german
invaders
paris
held
out
for
five
long
months
ten
days
before
the
surrender
of
the
city
in
the
nearby
palace
of
versailles
built
by
that
same
king
louis
xiv
who
had
been
such
a
dangerous
enemy
to
the
germans
the
king
of
prussia
was
publicly
proclaimed
german
emperor
and
a
loud
booming
of
guns
told
the
hungry
parisians
that
a
new
german
empire
had
taken
the
place
of
the
old
harmless
confederation
of
teutonic
states
and
stateless
in
this
rough
way
the
german
question
was
finally
settled
by
the
end
of
the
year
years
after
the
memorable
gathering
at
vienna
the
work
of
the
congress
had
been
entirely
undone
metternich
and
alexander
and
talleyrand
had
tried
to
give
the
people
of
europe
a
lasting
peace
the
methods
they
had
employed
had
caused
endless
wars
and
revolutions
and
the
feeling
of
a
common
brotherhood
of
the
eighteenth
century
was
followed
by
an
era
of
exaggerated
nationalism
which
has
not
yet
come
to
an
end
the
age
of
the
engine
but
while
the
people
of
europe
were
fighting
for
their
national
independence
the
world
in
which
they
lived
had
been
entirely
changed
by
a
series
of
inventions
which
had
made
the
clumsy
old
steam
engine
of
the
century
the
most
faithful
and
efficient
slave
of
man
the
greatest
benefactor
of
the
human
race
died
more
than
half
a
million
years
ago
he
was
a
hairy
creature
with
a
low
brow
and
sunken
eyes
a
heavy
jaw
and
strong
teeth
he
would
not
have
looked
well
in
a
gathering
of
modern
scientists
but
they
would
have
honoured
him
as
their
master
for
he
had
used
a
stone
to
break
a
nut
and
a
stick
to
lift
up
a
heavy
boulder
he
was
the
inventor
of
the
hammer
and
the
lever
our
first
tools
and
he
did
more
than
any
human
being
who
came
after
him
to
give
man
his
enormous
advantage
over
the
other
animals
with
whom
he
shares
this
planet
ever
since
man
has
tried
to
make
his
life
easier
by
the
use
of
a
greater
number
of
tools
the
first
wheel
a
round
disc
made
out
of
an
old
tree
created
as
much
stir
in
the
communities
of
as
the
flying
machine
did
only
a
few
years
ago
in
washington
the
story
is
told
of
a
director
of
the
patent
office
who
in
the
early
thirties
of
the
last
century
suggested
that
the
patent
office
be
abolished
because
everything
that
possibly
could
be
invented
had
been
invented
a
similar
feeling
must
have
spread
through
the
prehistoric
world
when
the
first
sail
was
hoisted
on
a
raft
and
the
people
were
able
to
move
from
place
to
place
without
rowing
or
punting
or
pulling
from
the
shore
indeed
one
of
the
most
interesting
chapters
of
history
is
the
effort
of
man
to
let
some
one
else
or
something
else
do
his
work
for
him
while
he
enjoyed
his
leisure
sitting
in
the
sun
or
painting
pictures
on
rocks
or
training
young
wolves
and
little
tigers
to
behave
like
peaceful
domestic
animals
of
course
in
the
very
olden
days
it
was
always
possible
to
enslave
a
weaker
neighbour
and
force
him
to
do
the
unpleasant
tasks
of
life
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
greeks
and
romans
who
were
quite
as
intelligent
as
we
are
failed
to
devise
more
interesting
machinery
was
to
be
found
in
the
existence
of
slavery
why
should
a
great
mathematician
waste
his
time
upon
wires
and
pulleys
and
cogs
and
fill
the
air
with
noise
and
smoke
when
he
could
go
to
the
marketplace
and
buy
all
the
slaves
he
needed
at
a
very
small
expense
and
during
the
although
slavery
had
been
abolished
and
only
a
mild
form
of
serfdom
survived
the
guilds
discouraged
the
idea
of
using
machinery
because
they
thought
this
would
throw
a
large
number
of
their
brethren
out
of
work
besides
the
were
not
at
all
interested
in
producing
large
quantities
of
goods
their
tailors
and
butchers
and
carpenters
worked
for
the
immediate
needs
of
the
small
community
in
which
they
lived
and
had
no
desire
to
compete
with
their
neighbours
or
to
produce
more
than
was
strictly
necessary
during
the
renaissance
when
the
prejudices
of
the
church
against
scientific
investigations
could
no
longer
be
enforced
as
rigidly
as
before
a
large
number
of
men
began
to
devote
their
lives
to
mathematics
and
astronomy
and
physics
and
chemistry
two
years
before
the
beginning
of
the
thirty
years
war
john
napier
a
scotchman
had
published
his
little
book
which
described
the
new
invention
of
logarithms
during
the
war
gottfried
leibnitz
of
leipzig
had
perfected
the
system
of
infinitesimal
calculus
eight
years
before
the
peace
of
westphalia
newton
the
great
english
natural
philosopher
was
born
and
in
that
same
year
galileo
the
italian
astronomer
died
meanwhile
the
thirty
years
war
had
destroyed
the
prosperity
of
central
europe
and
there
was
a
sudden
but
very
general
interest
in
alchemy
the
strange
of
the
by
which
people
hoped
to
turn
base
metals
into
gold
this
proved
to
be
impossible
but
the
alchemists
in
their
laboratories
stumbled
upon
many
new
ideas
and
greatly
helped
the
work
of
the
chemists
who
were
their
successors
the
work
of
all
these
men
provided
the
world
with
a
solid
scientific
foundation
upon
which
it
was
possible
to
build
even
the
most
complicated
of
engines
and
a
number
of
practical
men
made
good
use
of
it
the
had
used
wood
for
the
few
bits
of
necessary
machinery
but
wood
wore
out
easily
iron
was
a
much
better
material
but
iron
was
scarce
except
in
england
in
england
therefore
most
of
the
smelting
was
done
to
smelt
iron
huge
fires
were
needed
in
the
beginning
these
fires
had
been
made
of
wood
but
gradually
the
forests
had
been
used
up
then
stone
coal
the
petrified
trees
of
prehistoric
times
was
used
but
coal
as
you
know
has
to
be
dug
out
of
the
ground
and
it
has
to
be
transported
to
the
smelting
ovens
and
the
mines
have
to
be
kept
dry
from
the
ever
invading
waters
these
were
two
problems
which
had
to
be
solved
at
once
for
the
time
being
horses
could
still
be
used
to
haul
the
but
the
pumping
question
demanded
the
application
of
special
machinery
several
inventors
were
busy
trying
to
solve
the
difficulty
they
all
knew
that
steam
would
have
to
be
used
in
their
new
engine
the
idea
of
the
steam
engine
was
very
old
hero
of
alexandria
who
lived
in
the
first
century
before
christ
has
described
to
us
several
bits
of
machinery
which
were
driven
by
steam
the
people
of
the
renaissance
had
played
with
the
notion
of
war
chariots
the
marquis
of
worcester
a
contemporary
of
newton
in
his
book
of
inventions
tells
of
a
steam
engine
a
little
later
in
the
year
thomas
savery
of
london
applied
for
a
patent
for
a
pumping
engine
at
the
same
time
a
hollander
christian
huygens
was
trying
to
perfect
an
engine
in
which
was
used
to
cause
regular
explosions
in
much
the
same
way
as
we
use
gasoline
in
our
motors
all
over
europe
people
were
busy
with
the
idea
denis
papin
a
frenchman
friend
and
assistant
of
huygens
was
making
experiments
with
steam
engines
in
several
countries
he
invented
a
little
wagon
that
was
driven
by
steam
and
a
boat
but
when
he
tried
to
take
a
trip
in
his
vessel
it
was
confiscated
by
the
authorities
on
a
complaint
of
the
boatmen
union
who
feared
that
such
a
craft
would
deprive
them
of
their
livelihood
papin
finally
died
in
london
in
great
poverty
having
wasted
all
his
money
on
his
inventions
but
at
the
time
of
his
death
another
mechanical
enthusiast
thomas
newcomen
was
working
on
the
problem
of
a
new
fifty
years
later
his
engine
was
improved
upon
by
james
watt
a
glasgow
instrument
maker
in
the
year
he
gave
the
world
the
first
steam
engine
that
proved
of
real
practical
value
but
during
the
centuries
of
experiments
with
a
the
political
world
had
greatly
changed
the
british
people
had
succeeded
the
dutch
as
the
of
the
world
trade
they
had
opened
up
new
colonies
they
took
the
raw
materials
which
the
colonies
produced
to
england
and
there
they
turned
them
into
finished
products
and
then
they
exported
the
finished
goods
to
the
four
corners
of
the
world
during
the
seventeenth
century
the
people
of
georgia
and
the
carolinas
had
begun
to
grow
a
new
shrub
which
gave
a
strange
sort
of
woolly
substance
the
cotton
wool
after
this
had
been
plucked
it
was
sent
to
england
and
there
the
people
of
lancastershire
wove
it
into
cloth
this
weaving
was
done
by
hand
and
in
the
homes
of
the
workmen
very
soon
a
number
of
improvements
were
made
in
the
process
of
weaving
in
the
year
john
kay
invented
the
fly
shuttle
in
james
hargreaves
got
a
patent
on
his
spinning
jenny
eli
whitney
an
american
invented
the
which
separated
the
cotton
from
its
seeds
a
job
which
had
previously
been
done
by
hand
at
the
rate
of
only
a
pound
a
day
finally
richard
arkwright
and
the
reverend
edmund
cartwright
invented
large
weaving
machines
which
were
driven
by
water
power
and
then
in
the
eighties
of
the
eighteenth
century
just
when
the
estates
general
of
france
had
begun
those
famous
meetings
which
were
to
revolutionise
the
political
system
of
europe
the
engines
of
watt
were
arranged
in
such
a
way
that
they
could
drive
the
weaving
machines
of
arkwright
and
this
created
an
economic
and
social
revolution
which
has
changed
human
relationship
in
almost
every
part
of
the
world
as
soon
as
the
stationary
engine
had
proved
a
success
the
inventors
turned
their
attention
to
the
problem
of
propelling
boats
and
carts
with
the
help
of
a
mechanical
contrivance
watt
himself
designed
plans
for
a
steam
locomotive
but
ere
he
had
perfected
his
ideas
in
the
year
a
locomotive
made
by
richard
trevithick
carried
a
load
of
twenty
tons
at
in
the
wales
mining
district
at
the
same
time
an
american
jeweller
and
by
the
name
of
robert
fulton
was
in
paris
trying
to
convince
napoleon
that
with
the
use
of
his
submarine
boat
the
nautilus
and
his
the
french
might
be
able
to
destroy
the
naval
supremacy
of
england
fulton
idea
of
a
steamboat
was
not
original
he
had
undoubtedly
copied
it
from
john
fitch
a
mechanical
genius
of
connecticut
whose
cleverly
constructed
steamer
had
first
navigated
the
delaware
river
as
early
as
the
year
but
napoleon
and
his
scientific
advisers
did
not
believe
in
the
practical
possibility
of
a
boat
and
although
the
engine
of
the
little
craft
puffed
merrily
on
the
seine
the
great
emperor
neglected
to
avail
himself
of
this
formidable
weapon
which
might
have
given
him
his
revenge
for
trafalgar
as
for
fulton
he
returned
to
the
united
states
and
being
a
practical
man
of
business
he
organised
a
successful
steamboat
company
together
with
robert
livingston
a
signer
of
the
declaration
of
independence
who
was
american
minister
to
france
when
fulton
was
in
paris
trying
to
sell
his
invention
the
first
steamer
of
this
new
company
the
clermont
which
was
given
a
monopoly
of
all
the
waters
of
new
york
state
equipped
with
an
engine
built
by
boulton
and
watt
of
birmingham
in
england
began
a
regular
service
between
new
york
and
albany
in
the
year
as
for
poor
john
fitch
the
man
who
long
before
any
one
else
had
used
the
for
commercial
purposes
he
came
to
a
sad
death
broken
in
health
and
empty
of
purse
he
had
come
to
the
end
of
his
resources
when
his
fifth
boat
which
was
propelled
by
means
of
a
had
been
destroyed
his
neighbours
jeered
at
him
as
they
were
to
laugh
a
hundred
years
later
when
professor
langley
constructed
his
funny
flying
machines
fitch
had
hoped
to
give
his
country
an
easy
access
to
the
broad
rivers
of
the
west
and
his
countrymen
preferred
to
travel
in
or
go
on
foot
in
the
year
in
utter
despair
and
misery
fitch
killed
himself
by
taking
poison
but
twenty
years
later
the
savannah
a
steamer
of
tons
and
making
six
knots
an
hour
the
mauretania
goes
just
four
times
as
fast
crossed
the
ocean
from
savannah
to
liverpool
in
the
record
time
of
days
then
there
was
an
end
to
the
derision
of
the
multitude
and
in
their
enthusiasm
the
people
gave
the
credit
for
the
invention
to
the
wrong
man
six
years
later
george
stephenson
a
scotchman
who
had
been
building
locomotives
for
the
purpose
of
hauling
coal
from
the
to
smelting
ovens
and
cotton
factories
built
his
famous
travelling
engine
which
reduced
the
price
of
coal
by
almost
seventy
per
cent
and
which
made
it
possible
to
establish
the
first
regular
passenger
service
between
manchester
and
liverpool
when
people
were
whisked
from
city
to
city
at
the
speed
of
fifteen
miles
per
hour
a
dozen
years
later
this
speed
had
been
increased
to
twenty
miles
per
hour
at
the
present
time
any
flivver
the
direct
descendant
of
the
puny
little
machines
of
daimler
and
levassor
of
the
eighties
of
the
last
century
can
do
better
than
these
early
puffing
billies
but
while
these
engineers
were
improving
upon
their
rattling
heat
engines
a
group
of
pure
scientists
men
who
devote
fourteen
hours
of
each
day
to
the
study
of
those
theoretical
scientific
phenomena
without
which
no
mechanical
progress
would
be
possible
were
following
a
new
scent
which
promised
to
lead
them
into
the
most
secret
and
hidden
domains
of
nature
two
thousand
years
ago
a
number
of
greek
and
roman
philosophers
notably
thales
of
miletus
and
pliny
who
was
killed
while
trying
to
study
the
eruption
of
vesuvius
of
the
year
when
pompeii
and
herculaneum
were
buried
beneath
the
ashes
had
noticed
the
strange
antics
of
bits
of
straw
and
of
feather
which
were
held
near
a
piece
of
amber
which
was
being
rubbed
with
a
bit
of
wool
the
schoolmen
of
the
middle
ages
had
not
been
interested
in
this
mysterious
electric
power
but
immediately
after
the
renaissance
william
gilbert
the
private
physician
of
queen
elizabeth
wrote
his
famous
treatise
on
the
character
and
behaviour
of
magnets
during
the
thirty
years
war
otto
von
guericke
the
burgomaster
of
magdeburg
and
the
inventor
of
the
constructed
the
first
electrical
machine
during
the
next
century
a
large
number
of
scientists
devoted
themselves
to
the
study
of
electricity
not
less
than
three
professors
invented
the
famous
leyden
jar
in
the
year
at
the
same
time
benjamin
franklin
the
most
universal
genius
of
america
next
to
benjamin
thomson
who
after
his
flight
from
new
hampshire
on
account
of
his
sympathies
became
known
as
count
rumford
was
devoting
his
attention
to
this
subject
he
discovered
that
lightning
and
the
electric
spark
were
manifestations
of
the
same
electric
power
and
continued
his
electric
studies
until
the
end
of
his
busy
and
useful
life
then
came
volta
with
his
famous
electric
pile
and
galvani
and
day
and
the
danish
professor
hans
christian
oersted
and
ampere
and
arago
and
faraday
all
of
them
diligent
searchers
after
the
true
nature
of
the
electric
forces
they
freely
gave
their
discoveries
to
the
world
and
samuel
morse
who
like
fulton
began
his
career
as
an
artist
thought
that
he
could
use
this
new
electric
current
to
transmit
messages
from
one
city
to
another
he
intended
to
use
copper
wire
and
a
little
machine
which
he
had
invented
people
laughed
at
him
morse
therefore
was
obliged
to
finance
his
own
experiments
and
soon
he
had
spent
all
his
money
and
then
he
was
very
poor
and
people
laughed
even
louder
he
then
asked
congress
to
help
him
and
a
special
committee
on
commerce
promised
him
their
support
but
the
members
of
congress
were
not
at
all
interested
and
morse
had
to
wait
twelve
years
before
he
was
given
a
small
congressional
appropriation
he
then
built
a
telegraph
between
baltimore
and
washington
in
the
year
he
had
shown
his
first
successful
telegraph
in
one
of
the
lecture
halls
of
new
york
university
finally
on
the
of
may
of
the
year
the
first
message
was
sent
from
washington
to
baltimore
and
the
whole
world
is
covered
with
telegraph
wires
and
we
can
send
news
from
europe
to
asia
in
a
few
seconds
years
later
alexander
graham
bell
used
the
electric
current
for
his
telephone
and
half
a
century
afterwards
marconi
improved
upon
these
ideas
by
inventing
a
system
of
sending
messages
which
did
away
entirely
with
the
wires
while
morse
the
new
englander
was
working
on
his
telegraph
michael
faraday
the
had
constructed
the
first
dynamo
this
tiny
little
machine
was
completed
in
the
year
when
europe
was
still
trembling
as
a
result
of
the
great
july
revolutions
which
had
so
severely
upset
the
plans
of
the
congress
of
vienna
the
first
dynamo
grew
and
grew
and
grew
and
it
provides
us
with
heat
and
with
light
you
know
the
little
incandescent
bulbs
which
edison
building
upon
french
and
english
experiments
of
the
forties
and
fifties
first
made
in
and
with
power
for
all
sorts
of
machines
if
i
am
not
mistaken
the
will
soon
entirely
drive
out
the
heat
engine
just
as
in
the
olden
days
the
more
prehistoric
animals
drove
out
their
less
efficient
neighbours
personally
but
i
know
nothing
about
machinery
this
will
make
me
very
happy
for
the
electric
engine
which
can
be
run
by
waterpower
is
a
clean
and
companionable
servant
of
mankind
but
the
the
marvel
of
the
eighteenth
century
is
a
noisy
and
dirty
creature
for
ever
filling
the
world
with
ridiculous
and
with
dust
and
soot
and
asking
that
it
be
fed
with
coal
which
has
to
be
dug
out
of
mines
at
great
inconvenience
and
risk
to
thousands
of
people
and
if
i
were
a
novelist
and
not
a
historian
who
must
stick
to
facts
and
may
not
use
his
imagination
i
would
describe
the
happy
day
when
the
last
steam
locomotive
shall
be
taken
to
the
museum
of
natural
history
to
be
placed
next
to
the
skeleton
of
the
dynosaur
and
the
pteredactyl
and
the
other
extinct
creatures
of
a
age
the
social
revolution
but
the
new
engines
were
very
expensive
and
only
people
of
wealth
could
afford
them
the
old
carpenter
or
shoemaker
who
had
been
his
own
master
in
his
little
workshop
was
obliged
to
hire
himself
out
to
the
owners
of
the
big
mechanical
tools
and
while
he
made
more
money
than
before
he
lost
his
former
independence
and
he
did
not
like
that
in
the
olden
days
the
work
of
the
world
had
been
done
by
independent
workmen
who
sat
in
their
own
little
workshops
in
the
front
of
their
houses
who
owned
their
tools
who
boxed
the
ears
of
their
own
apprentices
and
who
within
the
limits
prescribed
by
their
guilds
conducted
their
business
as
it
pleased
them
they
lived
simple
lives
and
were
obliged
to
work
very
long
hours
but
they
were
their
own
masters
if
they
got
up
and
saw
that
it
was
a
fine
day
to
go
fishing
they
went
fishing
and
there
was
no
one
to
say
no
but
the
introduction
of
machinery
changed
this
a
machine
is
really
nothing
but
a
greatly
enlarged
tool
a
railroad
train
which
carries
you
at
the
speed
of
a
mile
a
minute
is
in
reality
a
pair
of
very
fast
legs
and
a
steam
hammer
which
flattens
heavy
plates
of
iron
is
just
a
terrible
big
fist
made
of
steel
but
whereas
we
can
all
afford
a
pair
of
good
legs
and
a
good
strong
fist
a
railroad
train
and
a
steam
hammer
and
a
cotton
factory
are
very
expensive
pieces
of
machinery
and
they
are
not
owned
by
a
single
man
but
usually
by
a
company
of
people
who
all
contribute
a
certain
sum
and
then
divide
the
profits
of
their
railroad
or
cotton
mill
according
to
the
amount
of
money
which
they
have
invested
therefore
when
machines
had
been
improved
until
they
were
really
practicable
and
profitable
the
builders
of
those
large
tools
the
machine
manufacturers
began
to
look
for
customers
who
could
afford
to
pay
for
them
in
cash
during
the
early
middle
ages
when
land
had
been
almost
the
only
form
of
wealth
the
nobility
were
the
only
people
who
were
considered
wealthy
but
as
i
have
told
you
in
a
previous
chapter
the
gold
and
silver
which
they
possessed
was
quite
insignificant
and
they
used
the
old
system
of
barter
exchanging
cows
for
horses
and
eggs
for
honey
during
the
crusades
the
burghers
of
the
cities
had
been
able
to
gather
riches
from
the
reviving
trade
between
the
east
and
the
west
and
they
had
been
serious
rivals
of
the
lords
and
the
knights
the
french
revolution
had
entirely
destroyed
the
wealth
of
the
nobility
and
had
enormously
increased
that
of
the
middle
class
or
bourgeoisie
the
years
of
unrest
which
followed
the
great
revolution
had
offered
many
people
a
chance
to
get
more
than
their
share
of
this
world
goods
the
estates
of
the
church
had
been
confiscated
by
the
french
convention
and
had
been
sold
at
auction
there
had
been
a
terrific
amount
of
graft
land
speculators
had
stolen
thousands
of
square
miles
of
valuable
land
and
during
the
napoleonic
wars
they
had
used
their
capital
to
profiteer
in
grain
and
and
now
they
possessed
more
wealth
than
they
needed
for
the
actual
expenses
of
their
households
and
they
could
afford
to
build
themselves
factories
and
to
hire
men
and
women
to
work
the
machines
this
caused
a
very
abrupt
change
in
the
lives
of
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
within
a
few
years
many
cities
doubled
the
number
of
their
inhabitants
and
the
old
civic
centre
which
had
been
the
real
home
of
the
citizens
was
surrounded
with
ugly
and
cheaply
built
suburbs
where
the
workmen
slept
after
their
eleven
or
twelve
hours
or
thirteen
hours
spent
in
the
factories
and
from
where
they
returned
to
the
factory
as
soon
as
the
whistle
blew
far
and
wide
through
the
countryside
there
was
talk
of
the
fabulous
sums
of
money
that
could
be
made
in
the
towns
the
peasant
boy
accustomed
to
a
life
in
the
open
went
to
the
city
he
rapidly
lost
his
old
health
amidst
the
smoke
and
dust
and
dirt
of
those
early
and
badly
ventilated
workshops
and
the
end
very
often
was
death
in
the
or
in
the
hospital
of
course
the
change
from
the
farm
to
the
factory
on
the
part
of
so
many
people
was
not
accomplished
without
a
certain
amount
of
opposition
since
one
engine
could
do
as
much
work
as
a
hundred
men
the
others
who
were
thrown
out
of
employment
did
not
like
it
frequently
they
attacked
the
and
set
fire
to
the
machines
but
insurance
companies
had
been
organised
as
early
as
the
century
and
as
a
rule
the
owners
were
well
protected
against
loss
soon
newer
and
better
machines
were
installed
the
factory
was
surrounded
with
a
high
wall
and
then
there
was
an
end
to
the
rioting
the
ancient
guilds
could
not
possibly
survive
in
this
new
world
of
steam
and
iron
they
went
out
of
existence
and
then
the
workmen
tried
to
organise
regular
labour
unions
but
the
who
through
their
wealth
could
exercise
great
influence
upon
the
politicians
of
the
different
countries
went
to
the
legislature
and
had
laws
passed
which
forbade
the
forming
of
such
trade
unions
because
they
interfered
with
the
liberty
of
action
of
the
working
man
please
do
not
think
that
the
good
members
of
parliament
who
passed
these
laws
were
wicked
tyrants
they
were
the
true
sons
of
the
revolutionary
period
when
everybody
talked
of
liberty
and
when
people
often
killed
their
neighbours
because
they
were
not
quite
as
as
they
ought
to
have
been
since
liberty
was
the
foremost
virtue
of
man
it
was
not
right
that
should
dictate
to
their
members
the
hours
during
which
they
could
work
and
the
wages
which
they
must
demand
the
workman
must
at
all
times
be
free
to
sell
his
services
in
the
open
market
and
the
employer
must
be
equally
free
to
conduct
his
business
as
he
saw
fit
the
days
of
the
mercantile
system
when
the
state
had
regulated
the
industrial
life
of
the
entire
community
were
coming
to
an
end
the
new
idea
of
freedom
insisted
that
the
state
stand
entirely
aside
and
let
commerce
take
its
course
the
last
half
of
the
century
had
not
merely
been
a
time
of
intellectual
and
political
doubt
but
the
old
economic
ideas
too
had
been
replaced
by
new
ones
which
better
suited
the
need
of
the
hour
several
years
before
the
french
revolution
turgot
who
had
been
one
of
the
unsuccessful
ministers
of
finance
of
louis
xvi
had
preached
the
novel
doctrine
of
economic
liberty
turgot
lived
in
a
country
which
had
suffered
from
too
much
too
many
regulations
too
many
officials
trying
to
enforce
too
many
laws
remove
this
official
supervision
he
wrote
let
the
people
do
as
they
please
and
everything
will
be
all
right
soon
his
famous
advice
of
laissez
faire
became
the
around
which
the
economists
of
that
period
rallied
at
the
same
time
in
england
adam
smith
was
working
on
his
mighty
volumes
on
the
wealth
of
nations
which
made
another
plea
for
liberty
and
the
natural
rights
of
trade
thirty
years
later
after
the
fall
of
napoleon
when
the
reactionary
powers
of
europe
had
gained
their
victory
at
vienna
that
same
freedom
which
was
denied
to
the
people
in
their
political
relations
was
forced
upon
them
in
their
industrial
life
the
general
use
of
machinery
as
i
have
said
at
the
beginning
of
this
chapter
proved
to
be
of
great
advantage
to
the
state
wealth
increased
rapidly
the
machine
made
it
possible
for
a
single
country
like
england
to
carry
all
the
burdens
of
the
great
napoleonic
wars
the
capitalists
the
people
who
provided
the
money
with
which
machines
were
bought
reaped
enormous
profits
they
became
ambitious
and
began
to
take
an
interest
in
politics
they
tried
to
compete
with
the
landed
aristocracy
which
still
exercised
great
influence
upon
the
government
of
most
european
countries
in
england
where
the
members
of
parliament
were
still
elected
according
to
a
royal
decree
of
the
year
and
where
a
large
number
of
recently
created
industrial
centres
were
without
representation
they
brought
about
the
passing
of
the
reform
bill
of
the
year
which
changed
the
electoral
system
and
gave
the
class
of
the
more
influence
upon
the
legislative
body
this
however
caused
great
discontent
among
the
millions
of
factory
workers
who
were
left
without
any
voice
in
the
government
they
too
began
an
agitation
for
the
right
to
vote
they
put
their
demands
down
in
a
document
which
came
to
be
known
as
the
charter
the
debates
about
this
charter
grew
more
and
more
violent
they
had
not
yet
come
to
an
end
when
the
revolutions
of
the
year
broke
out
frightened
by
the
threat
of
a
new
outbreak
or
jacobinism
and
violence
the
english
government
placed
the
duke
of
wellington
who
was
now
in
his
eightieth
year
at
the
head
of
the
army
and
called
for
volunteers
london
was
placed
in
a
state
of
siege
and
preparations
were
made
to
suppress
the
coming
revolution
but
the
chartist
movement
killed
itself
through
bad
leadership
and
no
acts
of
violence
took
place
the
new
class
of
wealthy
factory
owners
i
dislike
the
word
bourgeoisie
which
has
been
used
to
death
by
the
apostles
of
a
new
social
order
slowly
increased
its
hold
upon
the
government
and
the
conditions
of
industrial
life
in
the
large
cities
continued
to
transform
vast
acres
of
pasture
and
into
dreary
slums
which
guard
the
approach
of
every
modern
european
town
emancipation
the
general
introduction
of
machinery
did
not
bring
about
the
era
of
happiness
and
prosperity
which
had
been
predicted
by
the
generation
which
saw
the
stage
coach
replaced
by
the
railroad
several
remedies
were
suggested
but
none
of
these
quite
solved
the
problem
in
the
year
just
before
the
passing
of
the
first
reform
bill
jeremy
bentham
the
great
english
student
of
legislative
methods
and
the
most
practical
political
reformer
of
that
day
wrote
to
a
friend
the
way
to
be
comfortable
is
to
make
others
comfortable
the
way
to
make
others
comfortable
is
to
appear
to
love
them
the
way
to
appear
to
love
them
is
to
love
them
in
reality
jeremy
was
an
honest
man
he
said
what
he
believed
to
be
true
his
opinions
were
shared
by
thousands
of
his
countrymen
they
felt
responsible
for
the
happiness
of
their
less
fortunate
neighbours
and
they
tried
their
very
best
to
help
them
and
heaven
knows
it
was
time
that
something
be
done
the
ideal
of
economic
freedom
the
laissez
faire
of
turgot
had
been
necessary
in
the
old
society
where
mediaeval
restrictions
lamed
all
industrial
effort
but
this
liberty
of
action
which
had
been
the
highest
law
of
the
land
had
led
to
a
terrible
yea
a
frightful
condition
the
hours
in
the
were
limited
only
by
the
physical
strength
of
the
workers
as
long
as
a
woman
could
sit
before
her
loom
without
fainting
from
fatigue
she
was
supposed
to
work
children
of
five
and
six
were
taken
to
the
cotton
mills
to
save
them
from
the
dangers
of
the
street
and
a
life
of
idleness
a
law
had
been
passed
which
forced
the
children
of
paupers
to
go
to
work
or
be
punished
by
being
chained
to
their
machines
in
return
for
their
services
they
got
enough
bad
food
to
keep
them
alive
and
a
sort
of
pigsty
in
which
they
could
rest
at
night
often
they
were
so
tired
that
they
fell
asleep
at
their
job
to
keep
them
awake
a
foreman
with
a
whip
made
the
rounds
and
beat
them
on
the
knuckles
when
it
was
necessary
to
bring
them
back
to
their
duties
of
course
under
these
circumstances
thousands
of
little
children
died
this
was
regrettable
and
the
employers
who
after
all
were
human
beings
and
not
without
a
heart
sincerely
wished
that
they
could
abolish
child
labour
but
since
man
was
free
it
followed
that
children
were
free
too
besides
if
jones
had
tried
to
work
his
factory
without
the
use
of
children
of
five
and
six
his
rival
stone
would
have
hired
an
extra
supply
of
little
boys
and
jones
would
have
been
forced
into
bankruptcy
it
was
therefore
impossible
for
jones
to
do
without
child
labour
until
such
time
as
an
act
of
parliament
should
forbid
it
for
all
employers
but
as
parliament
was
no
longer
dominated
by
the
old
landed
aristocracy
which
had
despised
the
upstart
with
their
money
bags
and
had
treated
them
with
open
contempt
but
was
under
control
of
the
representatives
from
the
industrial
centres
and
as
long
as
the
law
did
not
allow
workmen
to
combine
in
very
little
was
accomplished
of
course
the
intelligent
and
decent
people
of
that
time
were
not
blind
to
these
terrible
conditions
they
were
just
helpless
machinery
had
conquered
the
world
by
surprise
and
it
took
a
great
many
years
and
the
efforts
of
thousands
of
noble
men
and
women
to
make
the
machine
what
it
ought
to
be
man
servant
and
not
his
master
curiously
enough
the
first
attack
upon
the
outrageous
system
of
employment
which
was
then
common
in
all
parts
of
the
world
was
made
on
behalf
of
the
black
slaves
of
africa
and
america
slavery
had
been
introduced
into
the
american
continent
by
the
spaniards
they
had
tried
to
use
the
indians
as
labourers
in
the
fields
and
in
the
mines
but
the
indians
when
taken
away
from
a
life
in
the
open
had
lain
down
and
died
and
to
save
them
from
extinction
a
priest
had
suggested
that
negroes
be
brought
from
africa
to
do
the
work
the
negroes
were
strong
and
could
stand
rough
treatment
besides
association
with
the
white
man
would
give
them
a
chance
to
learn
christianity
and
in
this
way
they
would
be
able
to
save
their
souls
and
so
from
every
possible
point
of
view
it
would
be
an
excellent
arrangement
both
for
the
kindly
white
man
and
for
his
ignorant
black
brother
but
with
the
introduction
of
machinery
there
had
been
a
greater
demand
for
cotton
and
the
negroes
were
forced
to
work
harder
than
ever
before
and
they
too
like
the
indians
began
to
die
under
the
treatment
which
they
received
at
the
hands
of
the
overseers
stories
of
incredible
cruelty
constantly
found
their
way
to
europe
and
in
all
countries
men
and
women
began
to
agitate
for
the
abolition
of
slavery
in
england
william
wilberforce
and
zachary
macaulay
the
father
of
the
great
historian
whose
history
of
england
you
must
read
if
you
want
to
know
how
wonderfully
interesting
a
can
be
organised
a
society
for
the
suppression
of
slavery
first
of
all
they
got
a
law
passed
which
made
slave
trading
illegal
and
after
the
year
there
was
not
a
single
slave
in
any
of
the
british
colonies
the
revolution
of
put
an
end
to
slavery
in
the
french
possessions
the
portuguese
passed
a
law
in
the
year
which
promised
all
slaves
their
liberty
in
twenty
years
from
date
the
dutch
abolished
slavery
in
and
in
the
same
year
tsar
alexander
ii
returned
to
his
serfs
that
liberty
which
had
been
taken
away
from
them
more
than
two
centuries
before
in
the
united
states
of
america
the
question
led
to
grave
difficulties
and
a
prolonged
war
although
the
declaration
of
independence
had
laid
down
the
principle
that
all
men
were
created
free
and
equal
an
exception
had
been
made
for
those
men
and
women
whose
skins
were
dark
and
who
worked
on
the
plantations
of
the
southern
states
as
time
went
on
the
dislike
of
the
people
of
the
north
for
the
institution
of
slavery
increased
and
they
made
no
secret
of
their
feelings
the
southerners
however
claimed
that
they
could
not
grow
their
cotton
without
and
for
almost
fifty
years
a
mighty
debate
raged
in
both
the
congress
and
the
senate
the
north
remained
obdurate
and
the
south
would
not
give
in
when
it
appeared
impossible
to
reach
a
compromise
the
southern
states
threatened
to
leave
the
union
it
was
a
most
dangerous
point
in
the
history
of
the
union
many
things
might
have
happened
that
they
did
not
happen
was
the
work
of
a
very
great
and
very
good
man
on
the
sixth
of
november
of
the
year
abraham
lincoln
an
illinois
lawyer
and
a
man
who
had
made
his
own
intellectual
fortune
had
been
elected
president
by
the
republicans
who
were
very
strong
in
the
states
he
knew
the
evils
of
human
bondage
at
first
hand
and
his
shrewd
told
him
that
there
was
no
room
on
the
northern
continent
for
two
rival
nations
when
a
number
of
southern
states
seceded
and
formed
the
confederate
states
of
america
lincoln
accepted
the
challenge
the
northern
states
were
called
upon
for
volunteers
hundreds
of
thousands
of
young
men
responded
with
eager
enthusiasm
and
there
followed
four
years
of
bitter
civil
war
the
south
better
prepared
and
following
the
brilliant
leadership
of
lee
and
jackson
repeatedly
defeated
the
armies
of
the
north
then
the
economic
strength
of
new
england
and
the
west
began
to
tell
an
unknown
officer
by
the
name
of
grant
arose
from
obscurity
and
became
the
charles
martel
of
the
great
slave
war
without
interruption
he
hammered
his
mighty
blows
upon
the
crumbling
defences
of
the
south
early
in
the
year
president
lincoln
issued
his
emancipation
proclamation
which
set
all
slaves
free
in
april
of
the
year
lee
surrendered
the
last
of
his
brave
armies
at
appomattox
a
few
days
later
president
lincoln
was
murdered
by
a
lunatic
but
his
work
was
done
with
the
exception
of
cuba
which
was
still
under
spanish
domination
slavery
had
come
to
an
end
in
every
part
of
the
civilised
world
but
while
the
black
man
was
enjoying
an
increasing
amount
of
liberty
the
free
workmen
of
europe
did
not
fare
quite
so
well
indeed
it
is
a
matter
of
surprise
to
many
contemporary
writers
and
observers
that
the
masses
of
workmen
the
proletariat
did
not
die
out
from
sheer
misery
they
lived
in
dirty
houses
situated
in
miserable
parts
of
the
slums
they
ate
bad
food
they
received
just
enough
schooling
to
fit
them
for
their
tasks
in
case
of
death
or
an
accident
their
families
were
not
provided
for
but
the
brewery
and
distillery
interests
who
could
exercise
great
influence
upon
the
legislature
encouraged
them
to
forget
their
woes
by
offering
them
unlimited
quantities
of
whisky
and
gin
at
very
cheap
rates
the
enormous
improvement
which
has
taken
place
since
the
thirties
and
the
forties
of
the
last
century
is
not
due
to
the
efforts
of
a
single
man
the
best
brains
of
two
generations
devoted
themselves
to
the
task
of
saving
the
world
from
the
disastrous
results
of
the
introduction
of
machinery
they
did
not
try
to
destroy
the
capitalistic
system
this
would
have
been
very
foolish
for
the
accumulated
wealth
of
other
people
when
intelligently
used
may
be
of
very
great
benefit
to
all
mankind
but
they
tried
to
combat
the
notion
that
true
equality
can
exist
between
the
man
who
has
wealth
and
owns
the
factories
and
can
close
their
doors
at
will
without
the
risk
of
going
hungry
and
the
labourer
who
must
take
whatever
job
is
offered
at
whatever
wage
he
can
get
or
face
the
risk
of
starvation
for
himself
his
wife
and
his
children
they
endeavoured
to
introduce
a
number
of
laws
which
regulated
the
relations
between
the
factory
owners
and
the
factory
workers
in
this
the
reformers
have
been
increasingly
successful
in
all
countries
the
majority
of
the
labourers
are
well
protected
their
hours
are
being
reduced
to
the
excellent
average
of
eight
and
their
children
are
sent
to
the
schools
instead
of
to
the
mine
pit
and
to
the
of
the
cotton
mills
but
there
were
other
men
who
also
contemplated
the
sight
of
all
the
belching
who
heard
the
rattle
of
the
railroad
trains
who
saw
the
filled
with
a
surplus
of
all
sorts
of
materials
and
who
wondered
to
what
ultimate
goal
this
tremendous
activity
would
lead
in
the
years
to
come
they
remembered
that
the
human
race
had
lived
for
hundreds
of
thousands
of
years
without
commercial
and
industrial
competition
could
they
change
the
existing
order
of
things
and
do
away
with
a
system
of
rivalry
which
so
often
sacrificed
human
happiness
to
profits
this
idea
this
vague
hope
for
a
better
day
was
not
restricted
to
a
single
country
in
england
robert
owen
the
owner
of
many
cotton
mills
established
a
socialistic
community
which
was
a
success
but
when
he
died
the
prosperity
of
new
lanark
came
to
an
end
and
an
attempt
of
louis
blanc
a
french
journalist
to
establish
social
workshops
all
over
france
fared
no
better
indeed
the
increasing
number
of
socialistic
writers
soon
began
to
see
that
little
individual
communities
which
remained
outside
of
the
regular
industrial
life
would
never
be
able
to
accomplish
anything
at
all
it
was
necessary
to
study
the
fundamental
principles
underlying
the
whole
industrial
and
capitalistic
society
before
useful
remedies
could
be
suggested
the
practical
socialists
like
robert
owen
and
louis
blanc
and
francois
fournier
were
succeeded
by
theoretical
students
of
socialism
like
karl
marx
and
friedrich
engels
of
these
two
marx
is
the
best
known
he
was
a
very
brilliant
jew
whose
family
had
for
a
long
time
lived
in
germany
he
had
heard
of
the
experiments
of
owen
and
blanc
and
he
began
to
interest
himself
in
questions
of
labour
and
wages
and
unemployment
but
his
liberal
views
made
him
very
unpopular
with
the
police
authorities
of
germany
and
he
was
forced
to
flee
to
brussels
and
then
to
london
where
he
lived
a
poor
and
shabby
life
as
the
correspondent
of
the
new
york
tribune
no
one
thus
far
had
paid
much
attention
to
his
books
on
economic
subjects
but
in
the
year
he
organised
the
first
international
association
of
working
men
and
three
years
later
in
he
published
the
first
volume
of
his
treatise
called
capital
marx
believed
that
all
history
was
a
long
struggle
between
those
who
have
and
those
who
do
have
the
introduction
and
general
use
of
machinery
had
created
a
new
class
in
society
that
of
the
capitalists
who
used
their
surplus
wealth
to
buy
the
tools
which
were
then
used
by
the
labourers
to
produce
still
more
wealth
which
was
again
used
to
build
more
factories
and
so
on
until
the
end
of
time
meanwhile
according
to
marx
the
third
estate
the
bourgeoisie
was
growing
richer
and
richer
and
the
fourth
estate
the
proletariat
was
growing
poorer
and
poorer
and
he
predicted
that
in
the
end
one
man
would
possess
all
the
wealth
of
the
world
while
the
others
would
be
his
employees
and
dependent
upon
his
good
will
to
prevent
such
a
state
of
affairs
marx
advised
working
men
of
all
countries
to
unite
and
to
fight
for
a
number
of
political
and
economic
measures
which
he
had
enumerated
in
a
manifesto
in
the
year
the
year
of
the
last
great
european
revolution
these
views
of
course
were
very
unpopular
with
the
governments
of
europe
many
countries
especially
prussia
passed
severe
laws
against
the
socialists
and
policemen
were
ordered
to
break
up
the
socialist
meetings
and
to
arrest
the
speakers
but
that
sort
of
persecution
never
does
any
good
martyrs
are
the
best
possible
advertisements
for
an
unpopular
cause
in
europe
the
number
of
socialists
steadily
increased
and
it
was
soon
clear
that
the
socialists
did
not
contemplate
a
violent
revolution
but
were
using
their
increasing
power
in
the
different
parliaments
to
promote
the
interests
of
the
labouring
classes
socialists
were
even
called
upon
to
act
as
cabinet
ministers
and
they
with
progressive
catholics
and
protestants
to
undo
the
damage
that
had
been
caused
by
the
industrial
revolution
and
to
bring
about
a
fairer
division
of
the
many
benefits
which
had
followed
the
introduction
of
machinery
and
the
increased
production
of
wealth
the
age
of
science
but
the
world
had
undergone
another
change
which
was
of
greater
importance
than
either
the
political
or
the
industrial
revolutions
after
generations
of
oppression
and
persecution
the
scientist
had
at
last
gained
liberty
of
action
and
he
was
now
trying
to
discover
the
fundamental
laws
which
govern
the
universe
the
egyptians
the
babylonians
the
chaldeans
the
greeks
and
the
romans
had
all
contributed
something
to
the
first
vague
notions
of
science
and
scientific
investigation
but
the
great
migrations
of
the
fourth
century
had
destroyed
the
classical
world
of
the
mediterranean
and
the
christian
church
which
was
more
interested
in
the
life
of
the
soul
than
in
the
life
of
the
body
had
regarded
science
as
a
manifestation
of
that
human
arrogance
which
wanted
to
pry
into
divine
affairs
which
belonged
to
the
realm
of
almighty
god
and
which
therefore
was
closely
related
to
the
seven
deadly
sins
the
renaissance
to
a
certain
but
limited
extent
had
broken
through
this
wall
of
mediaeval
prejudices
the
reformation
however
which
had
overtaken
the
renaissance
in
the
early
century
had
been
hostile
to
the
ideals
of
the
new
civilisation
and
once
more
the
men
of
science
were
threatened
with
severe
punishment
should
they
try
to
pass
beyond
the
narrow
limits
of
knowledge
which
had
been
laid
down
in
holy
writ
our
world
is
filled
with
the
statues
of
great
generals
atop
of
prancing
horses
leading
their
cheering
soldiers
to
glorious
victory
here
and
there
a
modest
slab
of
marble
announces
that
a
man
of
science
has
found
his
final
resting
place
a
thousand
years
from
now
we
shall
probably
do
these
things
differently
and
the
children
of
that
happy
generation
shall
know
of
the
splendid
courage
and
the
almost
inconceivable
devotion
to
duty
of
the
men
who
were
the
pioneers
of
that
abstract
knowledge
which
alone
has
made
our
modern
world
a
practical
possibility
many
of
these
scientific
pioneers
suffered
poverty
and
contempt
and
humiliation
they
lived
in
garrets
and
died
in
dungeons
they
dared
not
print
their
names
on
the
of
their
books
and
they
dared
not
print
their
conclusions
in
the
land
of
their
birth
but
smuggled
the
manuscripts
to
some
secret
printing
shop
in
amsterdam
or
haarlem
they
were
exposed
to
the
bitter
enmity
of
the
church
both
protestant
and
catholic
and
were
the
subjects
of
endless
sermons
inciting
the
parishioners
to
violence
against
the
heretics
here
and
there
they
found
an
asylum
in
holland
where
the
spirit
of
tolerance
was
strongest
the
authorities
while
regarding
these
scientific
investigations
with
little
favour
yet
refused
to
interfere
with
people
freedom
of
thought
it
became
a
little
asylum
for
intellectual
liberty
where
french
and
english
and
german
philosophers
and
mathematicians
and
physicians
could
go
to
enjoy
a
short
spell
of
rest
and
get
a
breath
of
free
air
in
another
chapter
i
have
told
you
how
roger
bacon
the
great
genius
of
the
thirteenth
century
was
prevented
for
years
from
writing
a
single
word
lest
he
get
into
new
troubles
with
the
authorities
of
the
church
and
five
hundred
years
later
the
contributors
to
the
great
philosophic
encyclopaedia
were
under
the
constant
supervision
of
the
french
gendarmerie
half
a
century
afterwards
darwin
who
dared
to
question
the
story
of
the
creation
of
man
as
revealed
in
the
bible
was
denounced
from
every
pulpit
as
an
enemy
of
the
human
race
even
the
persecution
of
those
who
venture
into
the
unknown
realm
of
science
has
not
entirely
come
to
an
end
and
while
i
am
writing
this
bryan
is
addressing
a
vast
multitude
on
the
menace
of
darwinism
warning
his
hearers
against
the
errors
of
the
great
english
naturalist
all
this
however
is
a
mere
detail
the
work
that
has
to
be
done
invariably
gets
done
and
the
ultimate
profit
of
the
discoveries
and
the
inventions
goes
to
the
mass
of
those
same
people
who
have
always
decried
the
man
of
vision
as
an
unpractical
idealist
the
seventeenth
century
had
still
preferred
to
investigate
the
far
off
heavens
and
to
study
the
position
of
our
planet
in
relation
to
the
solar
system
even
so
the
church
had
disapproved
of
this
unseemly
curiosity
and
copernicus
who
first
of
all
had
proved
that
the
sun
was
the
centre
of
the
universe
did
not
publish
his
work
until
the
day
of
his
death
galileo
spent
the
greater
part
of
his
life
under
the
supervision
of
the
clerical
authorities
but
he
continued
to
use
his
telescope
and
provided
isaac
newton
with
a
mass
of
practical
observations
which
greatly
helped
the
english
mathematician
when
he
the
existence
of
that
interesting
habit
of
falling
objects
which
came
to
be
known
as
the
law
of
gravitation
that
for
the
moment
at
least
exhausted
the
interest
in
the
heavens
and
man
began
to
study
the
earth
the
invention
of
a
workable
microscope
a
strange
and
clumsy
little
thing
by
anthony
van
leeuwenhoek
during
the
last
half
of
the
century
gave
man
a
chance
to
study
the
microscopic
creatures
who
are
responsible
for
so
many
of
his
ailments
it
laid
the
foundations
of
the
science
of
bacteriology
which
in
the
last
forty
years
has
delivered
the
world
from
a
great
number
of
diseases
by
discovering
the
tiny
organisms
which
cause
the
complaint
it
also
allowed
the
geologists
to
make
a
more
careful
study
of
different
rocks
and
of
the
fossils
the
petrified
prehistoric
plants
which
they
found
deep
below
the
surface
of
the
earth
these
investigations
convinced
them
that
the
earth
must
be
a
great
deal
older
than
was
stated
in
the
book
of
genesis
and
in
the
year
sir
charles
lyell
published
his
principles
of
geology
which
denied
the
story
of
creation
as
related
in
the
bible
and
gave
a
far
more
wonderful
description
of
slow
growth
and
gradual
development
at
the
same
time
the
marquis
de
laplace
was
working
on
a
new
theory
of
creation
which
made
the
earth
a
little
blotch
in
the
nebulous
sea
out
of
which
the
planetary
system
had
been
formed
and
bunsen
and
kirchhoff
by
the
use
of
the
spectroscope
were
investigating
the
chemical
composition
of
the
stars
and
of
our
good
neighbour
the
sun
whose
curious
spots
had
first
been
noticed
by
galileo
meanwhile
after
a
most
bitter
and
relentless
warfare
with
the
clerical
authorities
of
catholic
and
protestant
lands
the
anatomists
and
physiologists
had
at
last
obtained
permission
to
dissect
bodies
and
to
substitute
a
positive
knowledge
of
our
organs
and
their
habits
for
the
guesswork
of
the
mediaeval
quack
within
a
single
generation
between
and
more
progress
was
made
in
every
branch
of
science
than
in
all
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
years
that
had
passed
since
man
first
looked
at
the
stars
and
wondered
why
they
were
there
it
must
have
been
a
very
sad
age
for
the
people
who
had
been
educated
under
the
old
system
and
we
can
understand
their
feeling
of
hatred
for
such
men
as
lamarck
and
darwin
who
did
not
exactly
tell
them
that
they
were
descended
from
monkeys
an
accusation
which
our
grandfathers
seemed
to
regard
as
a
personal
insult
but
who
suggested
that
the
proud
human
race
had
evolved
from
a
long
series
of
ancestors
who
could
trace
the
back
to
the
little
who
were
the
first
inhabitants
of
our
planet
the
dignified
world
of
the
middle
class
which
dominated
the
nineteenth
century
was
willing
to
make
use
of
the
gas
or
the
electric
light
of
all
the
many
practical
applications
of
the
great
scientific
discoveries
but
the
mere
investigator
the
man
of
the
scientific
theory
without
whom
no
progress
would
be
possible
continued
to
be
distrusted
until
very
recently
then
at
last
his
services
were
recognised
today
the
rich
people
who
in
past
ages
donated
their
wealth
for
the
building
of
a
cathedral
construct
vast
laboratories
where
silent
men
do
battle
upon
the
hidden
enemies
of
mankind
and
often
sacrifice
their
lives
that
coming
generations
may
enjoy
greater
happiness
and
health
indeed
it
has
come
to
pass
that
many
of
the
ills
of
this
world
which
our
ancestors
regarded
as
inevitable
acts
of
god
have
been
exposed
as
manifestations
of
our
own
ignorance
and
neglect
every
child
nowadays
knows
that
he
can
keep
from
getting
typhoid
fever
by
a
little
care
in
the
choice
of
his
drinking
water
but
it
took
years
and
years
of
hard
work
before
the
doctors
could
convince
the
people
of
this
fact
few
of
us
now
fear
the
dentist
chair
a
study
of
the
microbes
that
live
in
our
mouth
has
made
it
possible
to
keep
our
teeth
from
decay
must
perchance
a
tooth
be
pulled
then
we
take
a
sniff
of
gas
and
go
our
way
rejoicing
when
the
newspapers
of
the
year
brought
the
story
of
the
painless
operation
which
had
been
performed
in
america
with
the
help
of
ether
the
good
people
of
europe
shook
their
heads
to
them
it
seemed
against
the
will
of
god
that
man
should
escape
the
pain
which
was
the
share
of
all
mortals
and
it
took
a
long
time
before
the
practice
of
taking
ether
and
chloroform
for
operations
became
general
but
the
battle
of
progress
had
been
won
the
breach
in
the
old
walls
of
prejudice
was
growing
larger
and
larger
and
as
time
went
by
the
ancient
stones
of
ignorance
came
crumbling
down
the
eager
crusaders
of
a
new
and
happier
social
order
rushed
forward
suddenly
they
found
themselves
facing
a
new
obstacle
out
of
the
ruins
of
a
past
another
citadel
of
reaction
had
been
erected
and
millions
of
men
had
to
give
their
lives
before
this
last
bulwark
was
destroyed
art
a
chapter
of
art
when
a
baby
is
perfectly
healthy
and
has
had
enough
to
eat
and
has
slept
all
it
wants
then
it
hums
a
little
tune
to
show
how
happy
it
is
to
this
humming
means
nothing
it
sounds
like
but
to
the
baby
it
is
perfect
music
it
is
his
first
contribution
to
art
as
soon
as
he
or
she
gets
a
little
older
and
is
able
to
sit
up
the
period
of
making
begins
these
do
not
interest
the
outside
world
there
are
too
many
million
babies
making
too
many
million
at
the
same
time
but
to
the
small
infant
they
represent
another
expedition
into
the
pleasant
realm
of
art
the
baby
is
now
a
sculptor
at
the
age
of
three
or
four
when
the
hands
begin
to
obey
the
brain
the
child
becomes
a
painter
his
fond
mother
gives
him
a
box
of
coloured
chalks
and
every
loose
bit
of
paper
is
rapidly
covered
with
strange
pothooks
and
scrawls
which
represent
houses
and
horses
and
terrible
naval
battles
soon
however
this
happiness
of
just
making
things
comes
to
an
end
school
begins
and
the
greater
part
of
the
day
is
filled
up
with
work
the
business
of
living
or
rather
the
business
of
making
a
living
becomes
the
most
important
event
in
the
life
of
every
boy
and
girl
there
is
little
time
left
for
art
between
learning
the
tables
of
multiplication
and
the
past
participles
of
the
irregular
french
verbs
and
unless
the
desire
for
making
certain
things
for
the
mere
pleasure
of
creating
them
without
any
hope
of
a
practical
return
be
very
strong
the
child
grows
into
manhood
and
forgets
that
the
first
five
years
of
his
life
were
mainly
devoted
to
art
nations
are
not
different
from
children
as
soon
as
the
had
escaped
the
threatening
dangers
of
the
long
and
shivering
and
had
put
his
house
in
order
he
began
to
make
certain
things
which
he
thought
beautiful
although
they
were
of
no
earthly
use
to
him
in
his
fight
with
the
wild
animals
of
the
jungle
he
covered
the
walls
of
his
grotto
with
pictures
of
the
elephants
and
the
deer
which
he
hunted
and
out
of
a
piece
of
stone
he
hacked
the
rough
figures
of
those
women
he
thought
most
attractive
as
soon
as
the
egyptians
and
the
babylonians
and
the
persians
and
all
the
other
people
of
the
east
had
founded
their
little
countries
along
the
nile
and
the
euphrates
they
began
to
build
magnificent
palaces
for
their
kings
invented
bright
pieces
of
jewellery
for
their
women
and
planted
gardens
which
sang
happy
songs
of
colour
with
their
many
bright
flowers
our
own
ancestors
the
wandering
nomads
from
the
distant
asiatic
prairies
enjoying
a
free
and
easy
existence
as
fighters
and
hunters
composed
songs
which
celebrated
the
mighty
deeds
of
their
great
leaders
and
invented
a
form
of
poetry
which
has
survived
until
our
own
day
a
thousand
years
later
when
they
had
established
themselves
on
the
greek
mainland
and
had
built
their
they
expressed
their
joy
and
their
sorrows
in
magnificent
temples
in
statues
in
comedies
and
in
tragedies
and
in
every
conceivable
form
of
art
the
romans
like
their
carthaginian
rivals
were
too
busy
administering
other
people
and
making
money
to
have
much
love
for
useless
and
unprofitable
adventures
of
the
spirit
they
conquered
the
world
and
built
roads
and
bridges
but
they
borrowed
their
art
wholesale
from
the
greeks
they
invented
certain
practical
forms
of
architecture
which
answered
the
demands
of
their
day
and
age
but
their
statues
and
their
histories
and
their
mosaics
and
their
poems
were
mere
latin
imitations
of
greek
originals
without
that
vague
and
something
which
the
world
calls
personality
there
can
be
no
art
and
the
roman
world
distrusted
that
particular
sort
of
personality
the
empire
needed
efficient
soldiers
and
tradesmen
the
business
of
writing
poetry
or
making
pictures
was
left
to
foreigners
then
came
the
dark
ages
the
barbarian
was
the
proverbial
bull
in
the
of
western
europe
he
had
no
use
for
what
he
did
not
understand
speaking
in
terms
of
the
year
he
liked
the
magazine
covers
of
pretty
ladies
but
threw
the
rembrandt
etchings
which
he
had
inherited
into
the
soon
he
came
to
learn
better
then
he
tried
to
undo
the
damage
which
he
had
created
a
few
years
before
but
the
were
gone
and
so
were
the
pictures
but
by
this
time
his
own
art
which
he
had
brought
with
him
from
the
east
had
developed
into
something
very
beautiful
and
he
made
up
for
his
past
neglect
and
indifference
by
the
art
of
the
middle
ages
which
as
far
as
northern
europe
is
concerned
was
a
product
of
the
germanic
mind
and
had
borrowed
but
little
from
the
greeks
and
the
latins
and
nothing
at
all
from
the
older
forms
of
art
of
egypt
and
assyria
not
to
speak
of
india
and
china
which
simply
did
not
exist
as
far
as
the
people
of
that
time
were
concerned
indeed
so
little
had
the
northern
races
been
influenced
by
their
southern
neighbours
that
their
own
architectural
products
were
completely
misunderstood
by
the
people
of
italy
and
were
treated
by
them
with
downright
and
unmitigated
contempt
you
have
all
heard
the
word
gothic
you
probably
associate
it
with
the
picture
of
a
lovely
old
cathedral
lifting
its
slender
spires
towards
high
heaven
but
what
does
the
word
really
mean
it
means
something
uncouth
and
barbaric
something
which
one
might
expect
from
an
uncivilised
goth
a
rough
who
had
no
respect
for
the
established
rules
of
classical
art
and
who
built
his
modern
horrors
to
please
his
own
low
tastes
without
a
decent
regard
for
the
examples
of
the
forum
and
the
acropolis
and
yet
for
several
centuries
this
form
of
gothic
architecture
was
the
highest
expression
of
the
sincere
feeling
for
art
which
inspired
the
whole
northern
continent
from
a
previous
chapter
you
will
remember
how
the
people
of
the
late
middle
ages
lived
unless
they
were
peasants
and
dwelt
in
villages
they
were
citizens
of
a
city
or
civitas
the
old
latin
name
for
a
tribe
and
indeed
behind
their
high
walls
and
their
deep
moats
these
good
burghers
were
true
tribesmen
who
shared
the
common
dangers
and
enjoyed
the
common
safety
and
prosperity
which
they
derived
from
their
system
of
mutual
protection
in
the
old
greek
and
roman
cities
the
where
the
temple
stood
had
been
the
centre
of
civic
life
during
the
middle
ages
the
church
the
house
of
god
became
such
a
centre
we
modern
protestant
people
who
go
to
our
church
only
once
a
week
and
then
for
a
few
hours
only
hardly
know
what
a
mediaeval
church
meant
to
the
community
then
before
you
were
a
week
old
you
were
taken
to
the
church
to
be
baptised
as
a
child
you
visited
the
church
to
learn
the
holy
stories
of
the
scriptures
later
on
you
became
a
member
of
the
congregation
and
if
you
were
rich
enough
you
built
yourself
a
separate
little
chapel
sacred
to
the
memory
of
the
patron
saint
of
your
own
family
as
for
the
sacred
edifice
it
was
open
at
all
hours
of
the
day
and
many
of
the
night
in
a
certain
sense
it
resembled
a
modern
club
dedicated
to
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
town
in
the
church
you
very
likely
caught
a
first
glimpse
of
the
girl
who
was
to
become
your
bride
at
a
great
ceremony
before
the
high
altar
and
finally
when
the
end
of
the
journey
had
come
you
were
buried
beneath
the
stones
of
this
familiar
building
that
all
your
children
and
their
grandchildren
might
pass
over
your
grave
until
the
day
of
judgement
because
the
church
was
not
only
the
house
of
god
but
also
the
true
centre
of
all
common
life
the
building
had
to
be
different
from
anything
that
had
ever
been
constructed
by
the
hands
of
man
the
temples
of
the
egyptians
and
the
greeks
and
the
romans
had
been
merely
the
shrine
of
a
local
divinity
as
no
sermons
were
preached
before
the
images
of
osiris
or
zeus
or
jupiter
it
was
not
necessary
that
the
interior
offer
space
for
a
great
multitude
all
the
religious
processions
of
the
old
mediterranean
peoples
took
place
in
the
open
but
in
the
north
where
the
weather
was
usually
bad
most
functions
were
held
under
the
roof
of
the
church
during
many
centuries
the
architects
struggled
with
this
problem
of
constructing
a
building
that
was
large
enough
the
roman
tradition
taught
them
how
to
build
heavy
stone
walls
with
very
small
windows
lest
the
walls
lose
their
strength
on
the
top
of
this
they
then
placed
a
heavy
stone
roof
but
in
the
twelfth
century
after
the
beginning
of
the
crusades
when
the
architects
had
seen
the
pointed
arches
of
the
mohammedan
builders
the
western
builders
discovered
a
new
style
which
gave
them
their
first
chance
to
make
the
sort
of
building
which
those
days
of
an
intense
religious
life
demanded
and
then
they
developed
this
strange
style
upon
which
the
italians
bestowed
the
contemptuous
name
of
gothic
or
barbaric
they
achieved
their
purpose
by
inventing
a
vaulted
roof
which
was
supported
by
ribs
but
such
a
roof
if
it
became
too
heavy
was
apt
to
break
the
walls
just
as
a
man
of
three
hundred
pounds
sitting
down
upon
a
child
chair
will
force
it
to
collapse
to
overcome
this
difficulty
certain
french
architects
then
began
to
the
walls
with
buttresses
which
were
merely
heavy
masses
of
stone
against
which
the
walls
could
lean
while
they
supported
the
roof
and
to
assure
the
further
safety
of
the
roof
they
supported
the
ribs
of
the
roof
by
flying
buttresses
a
very
simple
method
of
construction
which
you
will
understand
at
once
when
you
look
at
our
picture
this
new
method
of
construction
allowed
the
introduction
of
enormous
windows
in
the
twelfth
century
glass
was
still
an
expensive
curiosity
and
very
few
private
buildings
possessed
glass
windows
even
the
castles
of
the
nobles
were
without
protection
and
this
accounts
for
the
eternal
drafts
and
explains
why
people
of
that
day
wore
furs
as
well
as
out
fortunately
the
art
of
making
coloured
glass
with
which
the
ancient
people
of
the
mediterranean
had
been
familiar
had
not
been
entirely
lost
there
was
a
revival
of
stained
and
soon
the
windows
of
the
gothic
churches
told
the
stories
of
the
holy
book
in
little
bits
of
brilliantly
coloured
which
were
caught
in
a
long
framework
of
lead
behold
therefore
the
new
and
glorious
house
of
god
filled
with
an
eager
multitude
living
its
religion
as
no
people
have
ever
done
either
before
or
since
nothing
is
considered
too
good
or
too
costly
or
too
wondrous
for
this
house
of
god
and
home
of
man
the
sculptors
who
since
the
destruction
of
the
roman
empire
have
been
out
of
employment
haltingly
return
to
their
noble
art
portals
and
pillars
and
buttresses
and
cornices
are
all
covered
with
carven
images
of
our
lord
and
the
blessed
saints
the
embroiderers
too
are
set
to
work
to
make
tapestries
for
the
walls
the
jewellers
offer
their
highest
art
that
the
shrine
of
the
altar
may
be
worthy
of
complete
adoration
even
the
painter
does
his
best
poor
man
he
is
greatly
handicapped
by
lack
of
a
suitable
medium
and
thereby
hangs
a
story
the
romans
of
the
early
christian
period
had
covered
the
floors
and
the
walls
of
their
temples
and
houses
with
mosaics
pictures
made
of
coloured
bits
of
glass
but
this
art
had
been
exceedingly
difficult
it
gave
the
painter
no
chance
to
express
all
he
wanted
to
say
as
all
children
know
who
have
ever
tried
to
make
figures
out
of
coloured
blocks
of
wood
the
art
of
mosaic
painting
therefore
died
out
during
the
late
middle
ages
except
in
russia
where
the
byzantine
mosaic
painters
had
found
a
refuge
after
the
fall
of
constantinople
and
continued
to
ornament
the
walls
of
the
orthodox
churches
until
the
day
of
the
bolsheviki
when
there
was
an
end
to
the
building
of
churches
of
course
the
mediaeval
painter
could
mix
his
colours
with
the
water
of
the
wet
plaster
which
was
put
upon
the
walls
of
the
churches
this
method
of
painting
upon
fresh
plaster
which
was
generally
called
fresco
or
fresh
painting
was
very
popular
for
many
centuries
it
is
as
rare
as
the
art
of
painting
miniatures
in
manuscripts
and
among
the
hundreds
of
artists
of
our
modern
cities
there
is
perhaps
one
who
can
handle
this
medium
successfully
but
during
the
middle
ages
there
was
no
other
way
and
the
artists
were
fresco
workers
for
lack
of
something
better
the
method
however
had
certain
great
disadvantages
very
often
the
plaster
came
off
the
walls
after
only
a
few
years
or
dampness
spoiled
the
pictures
just
as
dampness
will
spoil
the
pattern
of
our
wall
paper
people
tried
every
imaginable
expedient
to
get
away
from
this
plaster
background
they
tried
to
mix
their
colours
with
wine
and
vinegar
and
with
honey
and
with
the
sticky
white
of
egg
but
none
of
these
methods
were
satisfactory
for
more
than
a
thousand
years
these
experiments
continued
in
painting
pictures
upon
the
parchment
leaves
of
manuscripts
the
mediaeval
artists
were
very
successful
but
when
it
came
to
covering
large
spaces
of
wood
or
stone
with
paint
which
would
stick
they
did
not
succeed
very
well
at
last
during
the
first
half
of
the
fifteenth
century
the
problem
was
solved
in
the
southern
netherlands
by
jan
and
hubert
van
eyck
the
famous
flemish
brothers
mixed
their
paint
with
specially
prepared
oils
and
this
allowed
them
to
use
wood
and
canvas
or
stone
or
anything
else
as
a
background
for
their
pictures
but
by
this
time
the
religious
ardour
of
the
early
middle
ages
was
a
thing
of
the
past
the
rich
burghers
of
the
cities
were
succeeding
the
bishops
as
patrons
of
the
arts
and
as
art
invariably
follows
the
full
the
artists
now
began
to
work
for
these
worldly
employers
and
painted
pictures
for
kings
for
and
for
rich
bankers
within
a
very
short
time
the
new
method
of
painting
with
oil
spread
through
europe
and
in
every
country
there
developed
a
school
of
special
painting
which
showed
the
characteristic
tastes
of
the
people
for
whom
these
portraits
and
landscapes
were
made
in
spain
for
example
velasquez
painted
and
the
weavers
of
the
royal
and
all
sorts
of
persons
and
subjects
connected
with
the
king
and
his
court
but
in
holland
rembrandt
and
frans
hals
and
vermeer
painted
the
barnyard
of
the
merchant
house
and
they
painted
his
rather
dowdy
wife
and
his
healthy
but
bumptious
children
and
the
ships
which
had
brought
him
his
wealth
in
italy
on
the
other
hand
where
the
pope
remained
the
largest
patron
of
the
arts
michelangelo
and
correggio
continued
to
paint
madonnas
and
saints
while
in
england
where
the
aristocracy
was
very
rich
and
powerful
and
in
france
where
the
kings
had
become
uppermost
in
the
state
the
artists
painted
distinguished
gentlemen
who
were
members
of
the
government
and
very
lovely
ladies
who
were
friends
of
his
majesty
the
great
change
in
painting
which
came
about
with
the
neglect
of
the
old
church
and
the
rise
of
a
new
class
in
society
was
reflected
in
all
other
forms
of
art
the
invention
of
printing
had
made
it
possible
for
authors
to
win
fame
and
reputation
by
writing
books
for
the
multitudes
in
this
way
arose
the
profession
of
the
novelist
and
the
illustrator
but
the
people
who
had
money
enough
to
buy
the
new
books
were
not
the
sort
who
liked
to
sit
at
home
of
nights
looking
at
the
ceiling
or
just
sitting
they
wanted
to
be
amused
the
few
minstrels
of
the
middle
ages
were
not
sufficient
to
cover
the
demand
for
entertainment
for
the
first
time
since
the
early
greek
of
two
thousand
years
before
the
professional
playwright
had
a
chance
to
ply
his
trade
the
middle
ages
had
known
the
theatre
merely
as
part
of
certain
church
celebrations
the
tragedies
of
the
thirteenth
and
fourteenth
centuries
had
told
the
story
of
the
suffering
of
our
lord
but
during
the
sixteenth
century
the
worldly
theatre
made
its
reappearance
it
is
true
that
at
first
the
position
of
the
professional
playwright
and
actor
was
not
a
very
high
one
william
shakespeare
was
regarded
as
a
sort
of
who
amused
his
neighbours
with
his
tragedies
and
comedies
but
when
he
died
in
the
year
he
had
begun
to
enjoy
the
respect
of
his
neighbours
and
actors
were
no
longer
subjects
of
police
supervision
william
contemporary
lope
de
vega
the
incredible
spaniard
who
wrote
no
less
than
worldly
and
religious
plays
was
a
person
of
rank
who
received
the
papal
approval
upon
his
work
a
century
later
moliere
the
frenchman
was
deemed
worthy
of
the
companionship
of
none
less
than
king
louis
xiv
since
then
the
theatre
has
enjoyed
an
ever
increasing
affection
on
the
part
of
the
people
a
theatre
is
part
of
every
city
and
the
silent
drama
of
the
movies
has
penetrated
to
the
tiniest
of
our
prairie
hamlets
another
art
however
was
to
become
the
most
popular
of
all
that
was
music
most
of
the
old
demanded
a
great
deal
of
technical
skill
it
takes
years
and
years
of
practice
before
our
clumsy
hand
is
able
to
follow
the
commands
of
the
brain
and
reproduce
our
vision
upon
canvas
or
in
marble
it
takes
a
to
learn
how
to
act
or
how
to
write
a
good
novel
and
it
takes
a
great
deal
of
training
on
the
part
of
the
public
to
appreciate
the
best
in
painting
and
writing
and
sculpture
but
almost
any
one
not
entirely
can
follow
a
tune
and
almost
everybody
can
get
enjoyment
out
of
some
sort
of
music
the
middle
ages
had
heard
a
little
music
but
it
had
been
entirely
the
music
of
the
church
the
holy
chants
were
subject
to
very
severe
laws
of
rhythm
and
harmony
and
soon
these
became
monotonous
besides
they
could
not
well
be
sung
in
the
street
or
in
the
the
renaissance
changed
this
music
once
more
came
into
its
own
as
the
best
friend
of
man
both
in
his
happiness
and
in
his
sorrows
the
egyptians
and
the
babylonians
and
the
ancient
jews
had
all
been
great
lovers
of
music
they
had
even
combined
different
instruments
into
regular
orchestras
but
the
greeks
had
frowned
upon
this
barbaric
foreign
noise
they
liked
to
hear
a
man
recite
the
stately
poetry
of
homer
and
pindar
they
allowed
him
to
accompany
himself
upon
the
lyre
the
poorest
of
all
stringed
instruments
that
was
as
far
as
any
one
could
go
without
incurring
the
risk
of
popular
disapproval
the
romans
on
the
other
hand
had
loved
orchestral
music
at
their
dinners
and
parties
and
they
had
invented
most
of
the
instruments
which
in
very
modified
form
we
use
the
early
church
had
despised
this
music
which
smacked
too
much
of
the
wicked
pagan
world
which
had
just
been
destroyed
a
few
songs
rendered
by
the
entire
congregation
were
all
the
bishops
of
the
third
and
fourth
centuries
would
tolerate
as
the
congregation
was
apt
to
sing
dreadfully
out
of
key
without
the
guidance
of
an
instrument
the
church
had
afterwards
allowed
the
use
of
an
organ
an
invention
of
the
second
century
of
our
era
which
consisted
of
a
combination
of
the
old
pipes
of
pan
and
a
pair
of
bellows
then
came
the
great
migrations
the
last
of
the
roman
musicians
were
either
killed
or
became
going
from
city
to
city
and
playing
in
the
street
and
begging
for
pennies
like
the
harpist
on
a
modern
but
the
revival
of
a
more
worldly
civilisation
in
the
cities
of
the
late
middle
ages
had
created
a
new
demand
for
musicians
instruments
like
the
horn
which
had
been
used
only
as
for
hunting
and
fighting
were
remodelled
until
they
could
reproduce
sounds
which
were
agreeable
in
the
and
in
the
banqueting
room
a
bow
strung
with
was
used
to
play
the
guitar
and
before
the
end
of
the
middle
ages
this
instrument
the
most
ancient
of
all
which
dates
back
to
egypt
and
assyria
had
grown
into
our
modern
fiddle
which
stradivarius
and
the
other
italian
of
the
eighteenth
century
brought
to
the
height
of
perfection
and
finally
the
modern
piano
was
invented
the
most
of
all
musical
instruments
which
has
followed
man
into
the
wilderness
of
the
jungle
and
the
of
greenland
the
organ
had
been
the
first
of
all
keyed
instruments
but
the
performer
always
depended
upon
the
of
some
one
who
worked
the
bellows
a
job
which
nowadays
is
done
by
electricity
the
musicians
therefore
looked
for
a
handier
and
less
circumstantial
instrument
to
assist
them
in
training
the
pupils
of
the
many
church
choirs
during
the
great
eleventh
century
guido
a
benedictine
monk
of
the
town
of
arezzo
the
birthplace
of
the
poet
petrarch
gave
us
our
modern
system
of
musical
annotation
some
time
during
that
century
when
there
was
a
great
deal
of
popular
interest
in
music
the
first
instrument
with
both
keys
and
strings
was
built
it
must
have
sounded
as
tinkly
as
one
of
those
tiny
children
pianos
which
you
can
buy
at
every
in
the
city
of
vienna
the
town
where
the
strolling
musicians
of
the
middle
ages
who
had
been
classed
with
jugglers
and
card
sharps
had
formed
the
first
separate
guild
of
musicians
in
the
year
the
little
monochord
was
developed
into
something
which
we
can
recognise
as
the
direct
ancestor
of
our
modern
steinway
from
austria
the
clavichord
as
it
was
usually
called
in
those
days
because
it
had
craves
or
keys
went
to
italy
there
it
was
perfected
into
the
spinet
which
was
so
called
after
the
inventor
giovanni
spinetti
of
venice
at
last
during
the
eighteenth
century
some
time
between
and
bartolomeo
cristofori
made
a
clavier
which
allowed
the
performer
to
play
both
loudly
and
softly
or
as
it
was
said
in
italian
piano
and
forte
this
instrument
with
certain
changes
became
our
pianoforte
or
piano
then
for
the
first
time
the
world
possessed
an
easy
and
convenient
instrument
which
could
be
mastered
in
a
couple
of
years
and
did
not
need
the
eternal
tuning
of
harps
and
fiddles
and
was
much
pleasanter
to
the
ears
than
the
mediaeval
tubas
clarinets
trombones
and
oboes
just
as
the
phonograph
has
given
millions
of
modern
people
their
first
love
of
music
so
did
the
early
pianoforte
carry
the
knowledge
of
music
into
much
wider
circles
music
became
part
of
the
education
of
every
man
and
woman
princes
and
rich
merchants
maintained
private
orchestras
the
musician
ceased
to
be
a
wandering
jongleur
and
became
a
highly
valued
member
of
the
community
music
was
added
to
the
dramatic
performances
of
the
theatre
and
out
of
this
practice
grew
our
modern
opera
originally
only
a
few
very
rich
princes
could
afford
the
expenses
of
an
opera
troupe
but
as
the
taste
for
this
sort
of
entertainment
grew
many
cities
built
their
own
theatres
where
italian
and
afterwards
german
operas
were
given
to
the
unlimited
joy
of
the
whole
community
with
the
exception
of
a
few
sects
of
very
strict
christians
who
still
regarded
music
with
deep
suspicion
as
something
which
was
too
lovely
to
be
entirely
good
for
the
soul
by
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
musical
life
of
europe
was
in
full
swing
then
there
came
forward
a
man
who
was
greater
than
all
others
a
simple
organist
of
the
thomas
church
of
leipzig
by
the
name
of
johann
sebastian
bach
in
his
compositions
for
every
known
instrument
from
comic
songs
and
popular
dances
to
the
most
stately
of
sacred
hymns
and
oratorios
he
laid
the
foundation
for
all
our
modern
music
when
he
died
in
the
year
he
was
succeeded
by
mozart
who
created
musical
fabrics
of
sheer
loveliness
which
remind
us
of
lace
that
has
been
woven
out
of
harmony
and
rhythm
then
came
ludwig
van
beethoven
the
most
tragic
of
men
who
gave
us
our
modern
orchestra
yet
heard
none
of
his
greatest
compositions
because
he
was
deaf
as
the
result
of
a
cold
contracted
during
his
years
of
poverty
beethoven
lived
through
the
period
of
the
great
french
revolution
full
of
hope
for
a
new
and
glorious
day
he
had
dedicated
one
of
his
symphonies
to
napoleon
but
he
lived
to
regret
the
hour
when
he
died
in
the
year
napoleon
was
gone
and
the
french
revolution
was
gone
but
the
steam
engine
had
come
and
was
filling
the
world
with
a
sound
that
had
nothing
in
common
with
the
dreams
of
the
third
symphony
indeed
the
new
order
of
steam
and
iron
and
coal
and
large
factories
had
little
use
for
art
for
painting
and
sculpture
and
poetry
and
music
the
old
protectors
of
the
arts
the
church
and
the
princes
and
the
merchants
of
the
middle
ages
and
the
seventeenth
and
eighteenth
centuries
no
longer
existed
the
leaders
of
the
new
industrial
world
were
too
busy
and
had
too
little
education
to
bother
about
etchings
and
sonatas
and
bits
of
carved
ivory
not
to
speak
of
the
men
who
created
those
things
and
who
were
of
no
practical
use
to
the
community
in
which
they
lived
and
the
workmen
in
the
factories
listened
to
the
drone
of
their
engines
until
they
too
had
lost
all
taste
for
the
melody
of
the
flute
or
fiddle
of
their
peasant
ancestry
the
arts
became
the
of
the
new
industrial
era
art
and
life
became
entirely
separated
whatever
paintings
had
been
left
were
dying
a
slow
death
in
the
museums
and
music
became
a
monopoly
of
a
few
virtuosi
who
took
the
music
away
from
the
home
and
carried
it
to
the
but
steadily
although
slowly
the
arts
are
coming
back
into
their
own
people
begin
to
understand
that
rembrandt
and
beethoven
and
rodin
are
the
true
prophets
and
leaders
of
their
race
and
that
a
world
without
art
and
happiness
resembles
a
nursery
without
laughter
colonial
expansion
and
war
a
chapter
which
ought
to
give
you
a
great
deal
of
political
information
about
the
last
fifty
years
but
which
really
contains
several
explanations
and
a
few
apologies
if
i
had
known
how
difficult
it
was
to
write
a
history
of
the
world
i
should
never
have
undertaken
the
task
of
course
any
one
possessed
of
enough
industry
to
lose
himself
for
half
a
dozen
years
in
the
musty
stacks
of
a
library
can
compile
a
ponderous
tome
which
gives
an
account
of
the
events
in
every
land
during
every
century
but
that
was
not
the
purpose
of
the
present
book
the
publishers
wanted
to
print
a
history
that
should
have
rhythm
a
story
which
galloped
rather
than
walked
and
now
that
i
have
almost
finished
i
discover
that
certain
chapters
gallop
that
others
wade
slowly
through
the
dreary
sands
of
long
forgotten
ages
that
a
few
parts
do
not
make
any
progress
at
all
while
still
others
indulge
in
a
veritable
jazz
of
action
and
romance
i
did
not
like
this
and
i
suggested
that
we
destroy
the
whole
manuscript
and
begin
once
more
from
the
beginning
this
however
the
publishers
would
not
allow
as
the
next
best
solution
of
my
difficulties
i
took
the
pages
to
a
number
of
charitable
friends
and
asked
them
to
read
what
i
had
said
and
give
me
the
benefit
of
their
advice
the
experience
was
rather
disheartening
each
and
every
man
had
his
own
prejudices
and
his
own
hobbies
and
preferences
they
all
wanted
to
know
why
where
and
how
i
dared
to
omit
their
pet
nation
their
pet
statesman
or
even
their
most
beloved
criminal
with
some
of
them
napoleon
and
jenghiz
khan
were
candidates
for
high
honours
i
explained
that
i
had
tried
very
hard
to
be
fair
to
napoleon
but
that
in
my
estimation
he
was
greatly
inferior
to
such
men
as
george
washington
gustavus
wasa
augustus
hammurabi
or
lincoln
and
a
score
of
others
all
of
whom
were
obliged
to
content
themselves
with
a
few
paragraphs
from
sheer
lack
of
space
as
for
jenghiz
khan
i
only
recognise
his
superior
ability
in
the
field
of
wholesale
murder
and
i
did
not
intend
to
give
him
any
more
publicity
than
i
could
help
this
is
very
well
as
far
as
it
goes
said
the
next
critic
but
how
about
the
puritans
we
are
celebrating
the
tercentenary
of
their
arrival
at
plymouth
they
ought
to
have
more
space
my
answer
was
that
if
i
were
writing
a
history
of
america
the
puritans
would
get
fully
one
half
of
the
first
twelve
chapters
that
however
this
was
a
history
of
mankind
and
that
the
event
on
plymouth
rock
was
not
a
matter
of
international
importance
until
many
centuries
later
that
the
united
states
had
been
founded
by
thirteen
colonies
and
not
by
a
single
one
that
the
most
prominent
leaders
of
the
first
twenty
years
of
our
history
had
been
from
virginia
from
pennsylvania
and
from
the
island
of
nevis
rather
than
from
massachusetts
and
that
therefore
the
puritans
ought
to
content
themselves
with
a
page
of
print
and
a
special
map
next
came
the
prehistoric
specialist
why
in
the
name
of
the
great
tyrannosaur
had
i
not
devoted
more
space
to
the
wonderful
race
of
men
who
had
developed
such
a
high
stage
of
civilisation
years
ago
indeed
and
why
not
the
reason
is
simple
i
do
not
take
as
much
stock
in
the
perfection
of
these
early
races
as
some
of
our
most
noted
anthropologists
seem
to
do
rousseau
and
the
philosophers
of
the
eighteenth
century
created
the
noble
savage
who
was
supposed
to
have
dwelt
in
a
state
of
perfect
happiness
during
the
beginning
of
time
our
modern
scientists
have
discarded
the
noble
savage
so
dearly
beloved
by
our
grandfathers
and
they
have
replaced
him
by
the
splendid
savage
of
the
french
valleys
who
years
ago
made
an
end
to
the
universal
rule
of
the
and
brutes
of
the
neanderthal
and
other
germanic
neighbourhoods
they
have
shown
us
the
elephants
the
painted
and
the
statues
he
carved
and
they
have
surrounded
him
with
much
glory
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
they
are
wrong
but
i
hold
that
we
know
by
far
too
little
of
this
entire
period
to
that
early
society
with
any
degree
however
humble
of
accuracy
and
i
would
rather
not
state
certain
things
than
run
the
risk
of
stating
certain
things
that
were
not
so
then
there
were
other
critics
who
accused
me
of
direct
unfairness
why
did
i
leave
out
such
countries
as
ireland
and
bulgaria
and
siam
while
i
dragged
in
such
other
countries
as
holland
and
iceland
and
switzerland
my
answer
was
that
i
did
not
drag
in
any
countries
they
pushed
themselves
in
by
main
force
of
circumstances
and
i
simply
could
not
keep
them
out
and
in
order
that
my
point
may
be
understood
let
me
state
the
basis
upon
which
active
membership
to
this
book
of
history
was
considered
there
was
but
one
rule
did
the
country
or
the
person
in
question
produce
a
new
idea
or
perform
an
original
act
without
which
the
history
of
the
entire
human
race
would
have
been
different
it
was
not
a
question
of
personal
taste
it
was
a
matter
of
cool
almost
mathematical
judgment
no
race
ever
played
a
more
picturesque
role
in
history
than
the
mongolians
and
no
race
from
the
point
of
view
of
achievement
or
intelligent
progress
was
of
less
value
to
the
rest
of
mankind
the
career
of
the
assyrian
is
full
of
dramatic
episodes
but
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
he
might
just
as
well
never
have
existed
at
all
in
the
same
way
the
history
of
the
dutch
republic
is
not
interesting
because
once
upon
a
time
the
sailors
of
de
ruyter
went
fishing
in
the
river
thames
but
rather
because
of
the
fact
that
this
small
along
the
shores
of
the
north
sea
offered
a
hospitable
asylum
to
all
sorts
of
strange
people
who
had
all
sorts
of
queer
ideas
upon
all
sorts
of
very
unpopular
subjects
it
is
quite
true
that
athens
or
florence
during
the
of
their
glory
had
only
one
tenth
of
the
population
of
kansas
city
but
our
present
civilisation
would
be
very
different
had
neither
of
these
two
little
cities
of
the
mediterranean
basin
existed
and
the
same
with
due
apologies
to
the
good
people
of
wyandotte
county
can
hardly
be
said
of
this
busy
metropolis
on
the
missouri
river
and
since
i
am
being
very
personal
allow
me
to
state
one
other
fact
when
we
visit
a
doctor
we
find
out
before
hand
whether
he
is
a
surgeon
or
a
diagnostician
or
a
homeopath
or
a
faith
healer
for
we
want
to
know
from
what
angle
he
will
look
at
our
complaint
we
ought
to
be
as
careful
in
the
choice
of
our
historians
as
we
are
in
the
selection
of
our
physicians
we
think
oh
well
history
is
history
and
let
it
go
at
that
but
the
writer
who
was
educated
in
a
strictly
presbyterian
household
somewhere
in
the
backwoods
of
scotland
will
look
differently
upon
every
question
of
human
relationships
from
his
neighbour
who
as
a
child
was
dragged
to
listen
to
the
brilliant
exhortations
of
robert
ingersoll
the
enemy
of
all
revealed
devils
in
due
course
of
time
both
men
may
forget
their
early
training
and
never
again
visit
either
church
or
lecture
hall
but
the
influence
of
these
impressionable
years
stays
with
them
and
they
can
not
escape
showing
it
in
whatever
they
write
or
say
or
do
in
the
preface
to
this
book
i
told
you
that
i
should
not
be
an
infallible
guide
and
now
that
we
have
almost
reached
the
end
i
repeat
the
warning
i
was
born
and
educated
in
an
atmosphere
of
the
liberalism
which
had
followed
the
discoveries
of
darwin
and
the
other
pioneers
of
the
nineteenth
century
as
a
child
i
happened
to
spend
most
of
my
waking
hours
with
an
uncle
who
was
a
great
collector
of
the
books
written
by
montaigne
the
great
french
essayist
of
the
sixteenth
century
because
i
was
born
in
rotterdam
and
educated
in
the
city
of
gouda
i
ran
continually
across
erasmus
and
for
some
unknown
reason
this
great
exponent
of
tolerance
took
hold
of
my
intolerant
self
later
i
discovered
anatole
france
and
my
first
experience
with
the
english
language
came
about
through
an
accidental
encounter
with
thackeray
henry
esmond
a
story
which
made
more
impression
upon
me
than
any
other
book
in
the
english
language
if
i
had
been
born
in
a
pleasant
middle
western
city
i
probably
should
have
a
certain
affection
for
the
hymns
which
i
had
heard
in
my
childhood
but
my
earliest
recollection
of
music
goes
back
to
the
afternoon
when
my
mother
took
me
to
hear
nothing
less
than
a
bach
fugue
and
the
mathematical
perfection
of
the
great
protestant
master
influenced
me
to
such
an
extent
that
i
can
not
hear
the
usual
hymns
of
our
without
a
feeling
of
intense
agony
and
direct
pain
again
if
i
had
been
born
in
italy
and
had
been
warmed
by
the
sunshine
of
the
happy
valley
of
the
arno
i
might
love
many
colourful
and
sunny
pictures
which
now
leave
me
indifferent
because
i
got
my
first
artistic
impressions
in
a
country
where
the
rare
sun
beats
down
upon
the
land
with
almost
cruel
brutality
and
throws
everything
into
violent
contrasts
of
dark
and
light
i
state
these
few
facts
deliberately
that
you
may
know
the
personal
bias
of
the
man
who
wrote
this
history
and
may
understand
his
the
bibliography
at
the
end
of
this
book
which
represents
all
sorts
of
opinions
and
views
will
allow
you
to
compare
my
ideas
with
those
of
other
people
and
in
this
way
you
will
be
able
to
reach
your
own
final
conclusions
with
a
greater
degree
of
fairness
than
would
otherwise
be
possible
after
this
short
but
necessary
excursion
we
return
to
the
history
of
the
last
fifty
years
many
things
happened
during
this
period
but
very
little
occurred
which
at
the
time
seemed
to
be
of
paramount
importance
the
majority
of
the
greater
powers
ceased
to
be
mere
political
agencies
and
became
large
business
enterprises
they
built
railroads
they
founded
and
subsidized
lines
to
all
parts
of
the
world
they
connected
their
different
possessions
with
telegraph
wires
and
they
steadily
increased
their
holdings
in
other
continents
every
available
bit
of
african
or
asiatic
territory
was
claimed
by
one
of
the
rival
powers
france
became
a
colonial
nation
with
interests
in
algiers
and
madagascar
and
annam
and
tonkin
in
eastern
asia
germany
claimed
parts
of
southwest
and
east
africa
built
settlements
in
kameroon
on
the
west
coast
of
africa
and
in
new
guinea
and
many
of
the
islands
of
the
pacific
and
used
the
murder
of
a
few
missionaries
as
a
welcome
excuse
to
take
the
harbour
of
kisochau
on
the
yellow
sea
in
china
italy
tried
her
luck
in
abyssinia
was
disastrously
defeated
by
the
soldiers
of
the
negus
and
consoled
herself
by
occupying
the
turkish
possessions
in
tripoli
in
northern
africa
russia
having
occupied
all
of
siberia
took
port
arthur
away
from
china
japan
having
defeated
china
in
the
war
of
occupied
the
island
of
formosa
and
in
the
year
began
to
lay
claim
to
the
entire
empire
of
corea
in
the
year
england
the
largest
colonial
empire
the
world
has
ever
seen
undertook
to
protect
egypt
she
performed
this
task
most
efficiently
and
to
the
great
material
benefit
of
that
much
neglected
country
which
ever
since
the
opening
of
the
suez
canal
in
had
been
threatened
with
a
foreign
invasion
during
the
next
thirty
years
she
fought
a
number
of
colonial
wars
in
different
parts
of
the
world
and
in
after
three
years
of
bitter
fighting
she
conquered
the
independent
boer
republics
of
the
transvaal
and
the
orange
free
state
meanwhile
she
had
encouraged
cecil
rhodes
to
lay
the
foundations
for
a
great
african
state
which
reached
from
the
cape
almost
to
the
mouth
of
the
nile
and
had
faithfully
picked
up
such
islands
or
provinces
as
had
been
left
without
a
european
owner
the
shrewd
king
of
belgium
by
name
leopold
used
the
discoveries
of
henry
stanley
to
found
the
congo
free
state
in
the
year
originally
this
gigantic
tropical
empire
was
an
absolute
monarchy
but
after
many
years
of
scandalous
mismanagement
it
was
annexed
by
the
belgian
people
who
made
it
a
colony
in
the
year
and
abolished
the
terrible
abuses
which
had
been
tolerated
by
this
very
unscrupulous
majesty
who
cared
nothing
for
the
fate
of
the
natives
as
long
as
he
got
his
ivory
and
rubber
as
for
the
united
states
they
had
so
much
land
that
they
desired
no
further
territory
but
the
terrible
misrule
of
cuba
one
of
the
last
of
the
spanish
possessions
in
the
western
hemisphere
practically
forced
the
washington
government
to
take
action
after
a
short
and
rather
uneventful
war
the
spaniards
were
driven
out
of
cuba
and
puerto
rico
and
the
philippines
and
the
two
latter
became
colonies
of
the
united
states
this
economic
development
of
the
world
was
perfectly
natural
the
increasing
number
of
factories
in
england
and
france
and
germany
needed
an
ever
increasing
amount
of
raw
materials
and
the
equally
increasing
number
of
european
workers
needed
an
ever
increasing
amount
of
food
everywhere
the
cry
was
for
more
and
for
richer
markets
for
more
easily
accessible
coal
mines
and
iron
mines
and
rubber
plantations
and
for
greater
supplies
of
wheat
and
grain
the
purely
political
events
of
the
european
continent
dwindled
to
mere
insignificance
in
the
eyes
of
men
who
were
making
plans
for
steamboat
lines
on
victoria
nyanza
or
for
railroads
through
the
interior
of
shantung
they
knew
that
many
european
questions
still
remained
to
be
settled
but
they
did
not
bother
and
through
sheer
indifference
and
carelessness
they
bestowed
upon
their
descendants
a
terrible
inheritance
of
hate
and
misery
for
untold
centuries
the
corner
of
europe
had
been
the
scene
of
rebellion
and
bloodshed
during
the
seventies
of
the
last
century
the
people
of
serbia
and
bulgaria
and
montenegro
and
roumania
were
once
more
trying
to
gain
their
freedom
and
the
turks
with
the
support
of
many
of
the
western
powers
were
trying
to
prevent
this
after
a
period
of
particularly
atrocious
massacres
in
bulgaria
in
the
year
the
russian
people
lost
all
patience
the
government
was
forced
to
intervene
just
as
president
mckinley
was
obliged
to
go
to
cuba
and
stop
the
of
general
weyler
in
havana
in
april
of
the
year
the
russian
armies
crossed
the
danube
stormed
the
shipka
pass
and
after
the
capture
of
plevna
marched
southward
until
they
reached
the
gates
of
constantinople
turkey
appealed
for
help
to
england
there
were
many
english
people
who
denounced
their
government
when
it
took
the
side
of
the
sultan
but
disraeli
who
had
just
made
queen
victoria
empress
of
india
and
who
loved
the
picturesque
turks
while
he
hated
the
russians
who
were
brutally
cruel
to
the
jewish
people
within
their
frontiers
decided
to
interfere
russia
was
forced
to
conclude
the
peace
of
san
stefano
and
the
question
of
the
balkans
was
left
to
a
congress
which
convened
at
berlin
in
june
and
july
of
the
same
year
this
famous
conference
was
entirely
dominated
by
the
personality
of
disraeli
even
bismarck
feared
the
clever
old
man
with
his
curly
hair
and
his
supreme
arrogance
tempered
by
a
cynical
sense
of
humor
and
a
marvellous
gift
for
flattery
at
berlin
the
british
carefully
watched
over
the
fate
of
his
friends
the
turks
montenegro
serbia
and
roumania
were
recognised
as
independent
kingdoms
the
principality
of
bulgaria
was
given
a
status
under
prince
alexander
of
battenberg
a
nephew
of
tsar
alexander
ii
but
none
of
those
countries
were
given
the
chance
to
develop
their
powers
and
their
resources
as
they
would
have
been
able
to
do
had
england
been
less
anxious
about
the
fate
of
the
sultan
whose
domains
were
necessary
to
the
safety
of
the
british
empire
as
a
bulwark
against
further
russian
aggression
to
make
matters
worse
the
congress
allowed
austria
to
take
bosnia
and
herzegovina
away
from
the
turks
to
be
administered
as
part
of
the
habsburg
domains
it
is
true
that
austria
made
an
excellent
job
of
it
the
neglected
provinces
were
as
well
managed
as
the
best
of
the
british
colonies
and
that
is
saying
a
great
deal
but
they
were
inhabited
by
many
serbians
in
older
days
they
had
been
part
of
the
great
serbian
empire
of
stephan
dushan
who
early
in
the
fourteenth
century
had
defended
western
europe
against
the
invasions
of
the
turks
and
whose
capital
of
uskub
had
been
a
centre
of
civilisation
one
hundred
and
fifty
years
before
columbus
discovered
the
new
lands
of
the
west
the
serbians
remembered
their
ancient
glory
as
who
would
not
they
resented
the
presence
of
the
austrians
in
two
provinces
which
so
they
felt
were
theirs
by
every
right
of
tradition
and
it
was
in
sarajevo
the
capital
of
bosnia
that
the
archduke
ferdinand
heir
to
the
austrian
throne
was
murdered
on
june
of
the
year
the
assassin
was
a
serbian
student
who
had
acted
from
purely
patriotic
motives
but
the
blame
for
this
terrible
catastrophe
which
was
the
immediate
though
not
the
only
cause
of
the
great
world
war
did
not
lie
with
the
serbian
boy
or
his
austrian
victim
it
must
be
traced
back
to
the
days
of
the
famous
berlin
conference
when
europe
was
too
busy
building
a
material
civilisation
to
care
about
the
aspirations
and
the
dreams
of
a
forgotten
race
in
a
dreary
corner
of
the
old
balkan
peninsula
a
new
world
the
great
war
which
was
really
the
struggle
for
a
new
and
better
world
the
marquis
de
condorcet
was
one
of
the
noblest
characters
among
the
small
group
of
honest
enthusiasts
who
were
responsible
for
the
outbreak
of
the
great
french
revolution
he
had
devoted
his
life
to
the
cause
of
the
poor
and
the
unfortunate
he
had
been
one
of
the
assistants
of
and
diderot
when
they
wrote
their
famous
encyclopedie
during
the
first
years
of
the
revolution
he
had
been
the
leader
of
the
moderate
wing
of
the
convention
his
tolerance
his
kindliness
his
stout
common
sense
had
made
him
an
object
of
suspicion
when
the
treason
of
the
king
and
the
court
clique
had
given
the
extreme
radicals
their
chance
to
get
hold
of
the
government
and
kill
their
opponents
condorcet
was
declared
hors
de
loi
or
outlawed
an
outcast
who
was
henceforth
at
the
mercy
of
every
true
patriot
his
friends
offered
to
hide
him
at
their
own
peril
condorcet
refused
to
accept
their
sacrifice
he
escaped
and
tried
to
reach
his
home
where
he
might
be
safe
after
three
nights
in
the
open
torn
and
bleeding
he
entered
an
inn
and
asked
for
some
food
the
suspicious
yokels
searched
him
and
in
his
pockets
they
found
a
copy
of
horace
the
latin
poet
this
showed
that
their
prisoner
was
a
man
of
gentle
breeding
and
had
no
business
upon
the
highroads
at
a
time
when
every
educated
person
was
regarded
as
an
enemy
of
the
revolutionary
state
they
took
condorcet
and
they
bound
him
and
they
gagged
him
and
they
threw
him
into
the
village
but
in
the
morning
when
the
soldiers
came
to
drag
him
back
to
paris
and
cut
his
head
off
behold
he
was
dead
this
man
who
had
given
all
and
had
received
nothing
had
good
reason
to
despair
of
the
human
race
but
he
has
written
a
few
sentences
which
ring
as
true
as
they
did
one
hundred
and
thirty
years
ago
i
repeat
them
here
for
your
benefit
nature
has
set
no
limits
to
our
hopes
he
wrote
and
the
picture
of
the
human
race
now
freed
from
its
chains
and
marching
with
a
firm
tread
on
the
road
of
truth
and
virtue
and
happiness
offers
to
the
philosopher
a
spectacle
which
consoles
him
for
the
errors
for
the
crimes
and
the
injustices
which
still
pollute
and
afflict
this
earth
the
world
has
just
passed
through
an
agony
of
pain
compared
to
which
the
french
revolution
was
a
mere
incident
the
shock
has
been
so
great
that
it
has
killed
the
last
spark
of
hope
in
the
breasts
of
millions
of
men
they
were
chanting
a
hymn
of
progress
and
four
years
of
slaughter
followed
their
prayers
for
peace
is
it
worth
while
so
they
ask
to
work
and
slave
for
the
benefit
of
creatures
who
have
not
yet
passed
beyond
the
stage
of
the
earliest
cave
men
there
is
but
one
answer
that
answer
is
yes
the
world
war
was
a
terrible
calamity
but
it
did
not
mean
the
end
of
things
on
the
contrary
it
brought
about
the
coming
of
a
new
day
it
is
easy
to
write
a
history
of
greece
and
rome
or
the
middle
ages
the
actors
who
played
their
parts
upon
that
stage
are
all
dead
we
can
criticize
them
with
a
cool
head
the
audience
that
applauded
their
efforts
has
dispersed
our
remarks
can
not
possibly
hurt
their
feelings
but
it
is
very
difficult
to
give
a
true
account
of
contemporary
events
the
problems
that
fill
the
minds
of
the
people
with
whom
we
pass
through
life
are
our
own
problems
and
they
hurt
us
too
much
or
they
please
us
too
well
to
be
described
with
that
fairness
which
is
necessary
when
we
are
writing
history
and
not
blowing
the
trumpet
of
propaganda
all
the
same
i
shall
endeavour
to
tell
you
why
i
agree
with
poor
condorcet
when
he
expressed
his
firm
faith
in
a
better
future
often
before
have
i
warned
you
against
the
false
impression
which
is
created
by
the
use
of
our
historical
epochs
which
divide
the
story
of
man
into
four
parts
the
ancient
world
the
middle
ages
the
renaissance
and
the
reformation
and
modern
time
the
last
of
these
terms
is
the
most
dangerous
the
word
modern
implies
that
we
the
people
of
the
twentieth
century
are
at
the
top
of
human
achievement
fifty
years
ago
the
liberals
of
england
who
followed
the
leadership
of
gladstone
felt
that
the
problem
of
a
truly
representative
and
democratic
form
of
government
had
been
solved
forever
by
the
second
great
reform
bill
which
gave
workmen
an
equal
share
in
the
government
with
their
employers
when
disraeli
and
his
conservative
friends
talked
of
a
dangerous
leap
in
the
dark
they
answered
no
they
felt
certain
of
their
cause
and
trusted
that
henceforth
all
classes
of
society
would
to
make
the
government
of
their
common
country
a
success
since
then
many
things
have
happened
and
the
few
liberals
who
are
still
alive
begin
to
understand
that
they
were
mistaken
there
is
no
definite
answer
to
any
historical
problem
every
generation
must
fight
the
good
fight
anew
or
perish
as
those
sluggish
animals
of
the
prehistoric
world
have
perished
if
you
once
get
hold
of
this
great
truth
you
will
get
a
new
and
much
broader
view
of
life
then
go
one
step
further
and
try
to
imagine
yourself
in
the
position
of
your
own
who
will
take
your
place
in
the
year
they
too
will
learn
history
but
what
will
they
think
of
those
short
four
thousand
years
during
which
we
have
kept
a
written
record
of
our
actions
and
of
our
thoughts
they
will
think
of
napoleon
as
a
contemporary
of
tiglath
pileser
the
assyrian
conqueror
perhaps
they
will
confuse
him
with
jenghiz
khan
or
alexander
the
macedonian
the
great
war
which
has
just
come
to
an
end
will
appear
in
the
light
of
that
long
commercial
conflict
which
settled
the
supremacy
of
the
mediterranean
when
rome
and
carthage
fought
during
one
hundred
and
years
for
the
mastery
of
the
sea
the
balkan
troubles
of
the
century
the
struggle
for
freedom
of
serbia
and
greece
and
bulgaria
and
montenegro
to
them
will
seem
a
continuation
of
the
disordered
conditions
caused
by
the
great
migrations
they
will
look
at
pictures
of
the
rheims
cathedral
which
only
yesterday
was
destroyed
by
german
guns
as
we
look
upon
a
photograph
of
the
acropolis
ruined
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
ago
during
a
war
between
the
turks
and
the
venetians
they
will
regard
the
fear
of
death
which
is
still
common
among
many
people
as
a
childish
superstition
which
was
perhaps
natural
in
a
race
of
men
who
had
burned
witches
as
late
as
the
year
even
our
hospitals
and
our
laboratories
and
our
operating
rooms
of
which
we
are
so
proud
will
look
like
slightly
improved
workshops
of
alchemists
and
mediaeval
surgeons
and
the
reason
for
all
this
is
simple
we
modern
men
and
women
are
not
modern
at
all
on
the
contrary
we
still
belong
to
the
last
generations
of
the
the
foundation
for
a
new
era
was
laid
but
yesterday
the
human
race
was
given
its
first
chance
to
become
truly
civilised
when
it
took
courage
to
question
all
things
and
made
knowledge
and
understanding
the
foundation
upon
which
to
create
a
more
reasonable
and
sensible
society
of
human
beings
the
great
war
was
the
of
this
new
world
for
a
long
time
to
come
people
will
write
mighty
books
to
prove
that
this
or
that
or
the
other
person
brought
about
the
war
the
socialists
will
publish
volumes
in
which
they
will
accuse
the
capitalists
of
having
brought
about
the
war
for
commercial
gain
the
capitalists
will
answer
that
they
lost
infinitely
more
through
the
war
than
they
made
that
their
children
were
among
the
first
to
go
and
fight
and
be
killed
and
they
will
show
how
in
every
country
the
bankers
tried
their
very
best
to
avert
the
outbreak
of
hostilities
french
historians
will
go
through
the
register
of
german
sins
from
the
days
of
charlemagne
until
the
days
of
william
of
hohenzollern
and
german
historians
will
return
the
compliment
and
will
go
through
the
list
of
french
horrors
from
the
days
of
charlemagne
until
the
days
of
president
poincare
and
then
they
will
establish
to
their
own
satisfaction
that
the
other
fellow
was
guilty
of
causing
the
war
statesmen
dead
and
not
yet
dead
in
all
countries
will
take
to
their
typewriters
and
they
will
explain
how
they
tried
to
avert
hostilities
and
how
their
wicked
opponents
forced
them
into
it
the
historian
a
hundred
years
hence
will
not
bother
about
these
apologies
and
vindications
he
will
understand
the
real
nature
of
the
underlying
causes
and
he
will
know
that
personal
ambitions
and
personal
wickedness
and
personal
greed
had
very
little
to
do
with
the
final
outburst
the
original
mistake
which
was
responsible
for
all
this
misery
was
committed
when
our
scientists
began
to
create
a
new
world
of
steel
and
iron
and
chemistry
and
electricity
and
forgot
that
the
human
mind
is
slower
than
the
proverbial
turtle
is
lazier
than
the
sloth
and
marches
from
one
hundred
to
three
hundred
years
behind
the
small
group
of
courageous
leaders
a
zulu
in
a
frock
coat
is
still
a
zulu
a
dog
trained
to
ride
a
bicycle
and
smoke
a
pipe
is
still
a
dog
and
a
human
being
with
the
mind
of
a
sixteenth
century
tradesman
driving
a
is
still
a
human
being
with
the
mind
of
a
sixteenth
century
tradesman
if
you
do
not
understand
this
at
first
read
it
again
it
will
become
clearer
to
you
in
a
moment
and
it
will
explain
many
things
that
have
happened
these
last
six
years
perhaps
i
may
give
you
another
more
familiar
example
to
show
you
what
i
mean
in
the
movie
theatres
jokes
and
funny
remarks
are
often
thrown
upon
the
screen
watch
the
audience
the
next
time
you
have
a
chance
a
few
people
seem
almost
to
inhale
the
words
it
takes
them
but
a
second
to
read
the
lines
others
are
a
bit
slower
still
others
take
from
twenty
to
thirty
seconds
finally
those
men
and
women
who
do
not
read
any
more
than
they
can
help
get
the
point
when
the
brighter
ones
among
the
audience
have
already
begun
to
decipher
the
next
it
is
not
different
in
human
life
as
i
shall
now
show
you
in
a
former
chapter
i
have
told
you
how
the
idea
of
the
roman
empire
continued
to
live
for
a
thousand
years
after
the
death
of
the
last
roman
emperor
it
caused
the
establishment
of
a
large
number
of
imitation
empires
it
gave
the
bishops
of
rome
a
chance
to
make
themselves
the
head
of
the
entire
church
because
they
represented
the
idea
of
roman
it
drove
a
number
of
perfectly
harmless
barbarian
chieftains
into
a
career
of
crime
and
endless
warfare
because
they
were
for
ever
under
the
spell
of
this
magic
word
rome
all
these
people
popes
emperors
and
plain
fighting
men
were
not
very
different
from
you
or
me
but
they
lived
in
a
world
where
the
roman
tradition
was
a
vital
issue
something
living
something
which
was
remembered
clearly
both
by
the
father
and
the
son
and
the
grandson
and
so
they
struggled
and
sacrificed
themselves
for
a
cause
which
would
not
find
a
dozen
recruits
in
still
another
chapter
i
have
told
you
how
the
great
religious
wars
took
place
more
than
a
century
after
the
first
open
act
of
the
reformation
and
if
you
will
compare
the
chapter
on
the
thirty
years
war
with
that
on
inventions
you
will
see
that
this
ghastly
butchery
took
place
at
a
time
when
the
first
clumsy
steam
engines
were
already
puffing
in
the
laboratories
of
a
number
of
french
and
german
and
english
scientists
but
the
world
at
large
took
no
interest
in
these
strange
contraptions
and
went
on
with
a
grand
theological
discussion
which
causes
yawns
but
no
anger
and
so
it
goes
a
thousand
years
from
now
the
historian
will
use
the
same
words
about
europe
of
the
nineteenth
century
and
he
will
see
how
men
were
engaged
upon
terrific
nationalistic
struggles
while
the
laboratories
all
around
them
were
filled
with
serious
folk
who
cared
not
one
whit
for
politics
as
long
as
they
could
force
nature
to
surrender
a
few
more
of
her
million
secrets
you
will
gradually
begin
to
understand
what
i
am
driving
at
the
engineer
and
the
scientist
and
the
chemist
within
a
single
generation
filled
europe
and
america
and
asia
with
their
vast
machines
with
their
telegraphs
their
flying
machines
their
products
they
created
a
new
world
in
which
time
and
space
were
reduced
to
complete
insignificance
they
invented
new
products
and
they
made
these
so
cheap
that
almost
every
one
could
buy
them
i
have
told
you
all
this
before
but
it
certainly
will
bear
repeating
to
keep
the
ever
increasing
number
of
factories
going
the
owners
who
had
also
become
the
rulers
of
the
land
needed
raw
materials
and
coal
especially
coal
meanwhile
the
mass
of
the
people
were
still
thinking
in
terms
of
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
and
clinging
to
the
old
notions
of
the
state
as
a
dynastic
or
political
organisation
this
clumsy
mediaeval
institution
was
then
suddenly
called
upon
to
handle
the
highly
modern
problems
of
a
mechanical
and
industrial
world
it
did
its
best
according
to
the
rules
of
the
game
which
had
been
laid
down
centuries
before
the
different
states
created
enormous
armies
and
gigantic
navies
which
were
used
for
the
purpose
of
acquiring
new
possessions
in
distant
lands
whereever
sic
there
was
a
tiny
bit
of
land
left
there
arose
an
english
or
a
french
or
a
german
or
a
russian
colony
if
the
natives
objected
they
were
killed
in
most
cases
they
did
not
object
and
were
allowed
to
live
peacefully
provided
they
did
not
interfere
with
the
diamond
mines
or
the
coal
mines
or
the
oil
mines
or
the
gold
mines
or
the
rubber
plantations
and
they
derived
many
benefits
from
the
foreign
occupation
sometimes
it
happened
that
two
states
in
search
of
raw
materials
wanted
the
same
piece
of
land
at
the
same
time
then
there
was
a
war
this
occurred
fifteen
years
ago
when
russia
and
japan
fought
for
the
possession
of
certain
which
belonged
to
the
chinese
people
such
conflicts
however
were
the
exception
no
one
really
desired
to
fight
indeed
the
idea
of
fighting
with
armies
and
battleships
and
submarines
began
to
seem
absurd
to
the
men
of
the
early
century
they
associated
the
idea
of
violence
with
the
age
of
unlimited
monarchies
and
intriguing
dynasties
every
day
they
read
in
their
papers
of
still
further
inventions
of
groups
of
english
and
american
and
german
scientists
who
were
working
together
in
perfect
friendship
for
the
purpose
of
an
advance
in
medicine
or
in
astronomy
they
lived
in
a
busy
world
of
trade
and
of
commerce
and
factories
but
only
a
few
noticed
that
the
development
of
the
state
of
the
gigantic
community
of
people
who
recognise
certain
common
ideals
was
lagging
several
hundred
years
behind
they
tried
to
warn
the
others
but
the
others
were
occupied
with
their
own
affairs
i
have
used
so
many
similes
that
i
must
apologise
for
bringing
in
one
more
the
ship
of
state
that
old
and
trusted
expression
which
is
ever
new
and
always
picturesque
of
the
egyptians
and
the
greeks
and
the
romans
and
the
venetians
and
the
merchant
adventurers
of
the
seventeenth
century
had
been
a
sturdy
craft
constructed
of
wood
and
commanded
by
officers
who
knew
both
their
crew
and
their
vessel
and
who
understood
the
limitations
of
the
art
of
navigating
which
had
been
handed
down
to
them
by
their
ancestors
then
came
the
new
age
of
iron
and
steel
and
machinery
first
one
part
then
another
of
the
old
ship
of
state
was
changed
her
dimensions
were
increased
the
sails
were
discarded
for
steam
better
living
quarters
were
established
but
more
people
were
forced
to
go
down
into
the
and
while
the
work
was
safe
and
fairly
remunerative
they
did
not
like
it
as
well
as
their
old
and
more
dangerous
job
in
the
rigging
finally
and
almost
imperceptibly
the
old
wooden
had
been
transformed
into
a
modern
ocean
liner
but
the
captain
and
the
mates
remained
the
same
they
were
appointed
or
elected
in
the
same
way
as
a
hundred
years
before
they
were
taught
the
same
system
of
navigation
which
had
served
the
mariners
of
the
fifteenth
century
in
their
cabins
hung
the
same
charts
and
signal
flags
which
had
done
service
in
the
days
of
louis
xiv
and
frederick
the
great
in
short
they
were
through
no
fault
of
their
own
completely
incompetent
the
sea
of
international
politics
is
not
very
broad
when
those
imperial
and
colonial
liners
began
to
try
and
outrun
each
other
accidents
were
bound
to
happen
they
did
happen
you
can
still
see
the
wreckage
if
you
venture
to
pass
through
that
part
of
the
ocean
and
the
moral
of
the
story
is
a
simple
one
the
world
is
in
dreadful
need
of
men
who
will
assume
the
new
leadership
who
will
have
the
courage
of
their
own
visions
and
who
will
recognise
clearly
that
we
are
only
at
the
beginning
of
the
voyage
and
have
to
learn
an
entirely
new
system
of
seamanship
they
will
have
to
serve
for
years
as
mere
apprentices
they
will
have
to
fight
their
way
to
the
top
against
every
possible
form
of
opposition
when
they
reach
the
bridge
mutiny
of
an
envious
crew
may
cause
their
death
but
some
day
a
man
will
arise
who
will
bring
the
vessel
safely
to
port
and
he
shall
be
the
hero
of
the
ages
as
it
ever
shall
be
the
more
i
think
of
the
problems
of
our
lives
the
more
i
am
persuaded
that
we
ought
to
choose
irony
and
pity
for
our
assessors
and
judges
as
the
ancient
egyptians
called
upon
the
goddess
isis
and
the
goddess
nephtys
on
behalf
of
their
dead
irony
and
pity
are
both
of
good
counsel
the
first
with
her
smiles
makes
life
agreeable
the
other
sanctifies
it
with
her
tears
the
irony
which
i
invoke
is
no
cruel
deity
she
mocks
neither
love
nor
beauty
she
is
gentle
and
kindly
disposed
her
mirth
disarms
and
it
is
she
who
teaches
us
to
laugh
at
rogues
and
fools
whom
but
for
her
we
might
be
so
weak
as
to
despise
and
hate
and
with
these
wise
words
of
a
very
great
frenchman

an
animated
chronology
the
end
concerning
the
pictures
concerning
the
pictures
of
this
book
and
a
few
words
about
the
bibliography
the
day
of
the
historical
textbook
without
illustrations
has
gone
pictures
and
photographs
of
famous
personages
and
equally
famous
occurrences
cover
the
pages
of
breasted
and
robinson
and
beard
in
this
volume
the
photographs
have
been
omitted
to
make
room
for
a
series
of
drawings
which
represent
ideas
rather
than
events
while
the
author
lays
no
claim
to
great
artistic
excellence
being
possessed
of
a
decided
leaning
towards
drawing
as
a
child
he
was
taught
to
play
the
violin
as
a
matter
of
discipline
he
prefers
to
make
his
own
maps
and
sketches
because
he
knows
exactly
what
he
wants
to
say
and
can
not
possibly
explain
this
meaning
to
his
more
proficient
brethren
in
the
field
of
art
besides
the
pictures
were
all
drawn
for
children
and
their
ideas
of
art
are
very
different
from
those
of
their
parents
to
all
teachers
the
author
would
give
this
advice
let
your
boys
and
girls
draw
their
history
after
their
own
desire
just
as
often
as
you
have
a
chance
you
can
show
a
class
a
photograph
of
a
greek
temple
or
a
mediaeval
castle
and
the
class
will
dutifully
say
yes
and
proceed
to
forget
all
about
it
but
make
the
greek
temple
or
the
roman
castle
the
centre
of
an
event
tell
the
boys
to
make
their
own
picture
of
the
building
of
a
temple
or
the
storming
of
the
castle
and
they
will
stay
after
to
finish
the
job
most
children
before
they
are
taught
how
to
draw
from
plaster
casts
can
draw
after
a
fashion
and
often
they
can
draw
remarkably
well
the
product
of
their
pencil
may
look
a
bit
prehistoric
it
may
even
resemble
the
work
of
certain
native
tribes
from
the
upper
congo
but
the
child
is
quite
frequently
prehistoric
or
in
his
or
her
own
tastes
and
expresses
these
primitive
instincts
with
a
most
astonishing
accuracy
the
main
thing
in
teaching
history
is
that
the
pupil
shall
remember
certain
events
in
their
proper
sequence
the
experiments
of
many
years
in
the
children
school
of
new
york
has
convinced
the
author
that
few
children
will
ever
forget
what
they
have
drawn
while
very
few
will
ever
remember
what
they
have
merely
read
it
is
the
same
with
the
maps
give
the
child
an
ordinary
conventional
map
with
dots
and
lines
and
green
seas
and
tell
him
to
revaluate
that
geographic
scene
in
his
or
her
own
terms
the
mountains
will
be
a
bit
out
of
gear
and
the
cities
will
look
astonishingly
mediaeval
the
outlines
will
be
often
very
imperfect
but
the
general
effect
will
be
quite
as
truthful
as
that
of
our
conventional
maps
which
ever
since
the
days
of
good
gerardus
mercator
have
told
a
strangely
erroneous
story
most
important
of
all
it
will
give
the
child
a
feeling
of
intimacy
with
historical
and
geographic
facts
which
can
not
be
obtained
in
any
other
way
neither
the
publishers
nor
the
author
claim
that
the
story
of
mankind
is
the
last
word
to
be
said
upon
the
subject
of
history
for
children
it
is
an
appetizer
the
book
tries
to
present
the
subject
in
such
a
fashion
that
the
average
child
shall
get
a
taste
for
history
and
shall
ask
for
more
to
facilitate
the
work
of
both
parents
and
teachers
the
publishers
have
asked
miss
leonore
john
power
who
knows
more
upon
this
particular
subject
than
any
one
else
they
could
discover
to
compile
a
list
of
readable
and
instructive
books
the
list
was
made
and
was
duly
printed
the
parents
who
live
near
our
big
cities
will
experience
no
difficulty
in
ordering
these
volumes
from
their
booksellers
those
who
for
the
sake
of
fresh
air
and
quiet
dwell
in
more
remote
spots
may
not
find
it
convenient
to
go
to
a
in
that
case
boni
and
liveright
will
be
happy
to
act
as
and
obtain
the
books
that
are
desired
they
want
it
to
be
distinctly
understood
that
they
have
not
gone
into
the
retail
book
business
but
they
are
quite
willing
to
do
their
share
towards
a
better
and
more
general
historical
education
and
all
orders
will
receive
their
immediate
attention
an
historical
reading
list
for
children
do
stop
i
say
to
explain
that

was
for
once
the
legitimate
daughter
of

as
such
had
the
privilege
to

just
yet
to

who
the

otherwise
ambergris
do
explain

do
trace

properties

tearing
up
paper
into

attracting
them

do
insist
philologically
that
when
every
shepherd
his
tale
he
is
not
relating
an
anecdote
but
simply
keeping
of
his
flock
just
go
on
reading
as
well
as
you
can
and
be
sure
that
when
the
children
get
the
thrill
of
the
story
for
which
you
wait
they
will
