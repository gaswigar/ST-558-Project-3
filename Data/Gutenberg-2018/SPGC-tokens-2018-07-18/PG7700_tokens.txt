lysistrata
translated
from
the
greek
of
aristophanes
illustrations
by
norman
lindsay
foreword
is
the
greatest
work
by
aristophanes
this
blank
and
rash
statement
is
made
that
it
may
be
rejected
but
first
let
it
be
understood
that
i
do
not
mean
it
is
a
better
written
work
than
the
or
the
or
that
to
descend
to
the
scale
of
values
that
will
be
naturally
imputed
to
me
it
has
any
more
appeal
to
the
collectors
of
curious
literature
than
the
or
the
on
the
mere
grounds
of
taste
i
can
see
an
at
least
equally
good
case
made
out
for
the
that
brightly
plumaged
fantasy
has
an
aerial
wit
and
colour
all
its
own
but
there
are
certain
works
in
which
a
man
finds
himself
at
an
angle
of
vision
where
there
is
an
especially
felicitous
union
of
the
aesthetic
and
emotional
elements
which
constitute
the
basic
qualities
of
his
uniqueness
we
recognize
these
works
as
being
welded
into
a
strange
unity
as
having
a
homogeneous
texture
of
ecstasy
over
them
that
surpasses
any
aesthetic
surface
of
harmonic
colour
though
that
harmony
also
is
understood
by
the
deeper
welling
of
imagery
from
the
core
of
creative
exaltation
and
i
think
that
this
occurs
in
the
intellectual
and
spiritual
tendrils
of
the
poem
are
more
truly
interwoven
the
operation
of
their
centres
more
nearly
unified
and
so
the
work
goes
deeper
into
life
it
is
his
greatest
play
because
of
this
because
it
holds
an
intimate
perfume
of
femininity
and
gives
the
finest
sense
of
the
charm
of
a
cluster
of
girls
the
sweet
sense
of
their
chatter
and
the
contact
of
their
bodies
that
is
to
be
found
before
shakespeare
because
that
mocking
gaiety
we
call
aristophanies
reaches
here
its
most
positive
acclamation
of
life
vitalizing
sex
with
a
deep
delight
a
rare
happiness
of
the
spirit
indeed
it
is
precisely
for
these
reasons
that
it
is
considered
aristophanes
greatest
play
to
take
a
case
which
is
sufficiently
near
to
the
point
in
question
to
make
clear
what
i
mean
the
supremacy
of
and
in
the
shakespearean
aesthetic
is
yet
jealously
disputed
and
it
seems
silly
to
the
academic
to
put
it
up
against
a
work
like
but
it
is
the
comparatively
more
obvious
achievement
of
its
surface
intellectuality
which
made
it
the
favourite
of
actors
and
critics
it
is
much
more
difficult
to
realize
the
complex
and
delicately
passionate
edge
of
the
former
play
rhythm
its
tides
of
hugely
wandering
emotion
the
restless
proud
gay
and
agonized
reaction
from
life
of
the
blood
of
the
mind
of
the
heart
which
is
its
unity
than
to
follow
the
relatively
straightforward
definition
of
hamlet
nerves
not
that
anything
derogatory
to
or
the
is
intended
but
the
value
of
such
works
is
not
enhanced
by
forcing
them
into
contrast
with
other
works
which
cover
deeper
and
wider
nexus
of
aesthetic
and
spiritual
material
it
is
the
very
subtlety
of
the
vitality
of
such
works
as
and
and
that
makes
it
so
easy
to
undervalue
them
to
see
only
a
phallic
play
and
political
pamphlet
in
one
only
a
chronicle
play
in
a
grandiose
method
in
the
other
for
we
have
to
be
in
a
highly
sensitized
condition
before
we
can
get
to
that
subtle
point
where
life
and
the
image
mix
and
so
really
perceive
the
work
at
all
whereas
we
can
command
the
response
to
a
lesser
work
which
does
not
call
so
finely
on
the
full
breadth
and
depth
of
our
spiritual
resources
i
amuse
myself
at
times
with
the
fancy
that
homer
sappho
and
aristophanes
are
the
inviolable
trinity
of
poetry
even
to
the
extent
of
being
reducible
to
one
for
the
fiery
and
lucid
directness
of
sappho
if
her
note
of
personal
lyricism
is
abstracted
is
seen
to
be
an
element
of
homer
as
is
the
profoundly
balanced
humour
of
aristophanes
at
once
tenderly
human
and
cruelly
hard
as
of
a
god
to
whom
all
sympathies
and
tolerances
are
known
but
who
is
invulnerable
somewhere
who
sees
from
a
point
in
space
where
the
pressure
of
earth
fear
and
pain
and
so
its
pity
is
lifted
it
is
here
that
the
shakespearean
and
homeric
worlds
impinge
and
merge
not
to
be
separated
by
any
academic
classifications
they
meet
in
this
sensitivity
equally
involved
and
aloof
sympathetic
and
arrogant
suffering
and
joyous
and
in
this
relation
we
see
aristophanes
as
the
forerunner
of
shakespeare
his
only
one
we
see
also
that
the
whole
present
aesthetic
of
earth
is
based
in
homer
we
live
and
grow
in
the
world
of
consciousness
bequeathed
to
us
by
him
and
if
we
grow
beyond
it
through
deeper
shakespearean
ardours
it
is
because
those
beyond
are
rooted
in
the
broad
basis
of
the
homeric
imagination
to
shift
that
basis
is
to
find
the
marshes
of
primitive
night
and
fear
alone
beneath
the
feet
christianity
and
here
we
return
to
the
question
of
the
immorality
of
first
we
may
inquire
is
it
possible
for
a
man
whose
work
has
so
tremendous
a
significance
in
the
spiritual
development
of
mankind
and
i
do
not
think
anyone
nowadays
doubts
that
a
work
of
art
is
the
sole
stabilizing
force
that
exists
for
life
is
it
possible
for
a
man
who
stands
so
grandly
at
head
of
an
immense
stream
of
liberating
effort
to
write
an
immoral
work
surely
the
only
enduring
moral
virtue
which
can
be
claimed
is
for
that
which
moves
to
more
power
beauty
and
delight
in
the
future
the
plea
that
the
question
of
changing
customs
arises
is
not
valid
for
customs
ratified
by
aristophanes
by
rabelais
by
shakespeare
have
no
right
to
change
if
they
have
changed
let
us
try
immediately
to
return
from
our
disgraceful
refinements
to
the
nobler
and
more
rarefied
heights
of
lyric
laughter
tragic
intensity
and
wit
for
we
can
not
have
the
first
two
without
the
last
and
anyhow
how
can
a
social
custom
claim
precedence
over
the
undying
material
of
the
senses
and
the
emotions
of
man
over
the
very
generating
forces
of
life
how
could
the
humanistic
emotions
such
as
pity
justice
sympathy
exist
save
as
pacifistic
quietings
of
the
desire
to
slay
to
hurt
to
torment
where
the
desire
to
hurt
is
gone
pity
ceases
to
be
a
significant
a
central
emotion
it
must
of
course
continue
to
exist
but
it
is
displaced
in
the
spiritual
hierarchy
and
all
that
moves
courageously
desirously
and
vitally
into
the
action
of
life
takes
on
a
deeper
and
subtler
intention
lust
then
which
on
the
lower
plane
was
something
to
be
very
frightened
of
becomes
a
symbol
of
the
highest
spirituality
it
is
right
for
paul
to
be
terrified
of
sex
and
so
to
hate
it
because
he
has
so
freshly
escaped
a
bestial
condition
of
life
that
it
threatens
to
plunge
him
back
if
he
listens
to
one
whisper
but
it
is
also
right
for
a
shakespeare
to
suck
every
drop
of
desire
from
life
for
he
is
building
into
a
higher
condition
one
the
discipline
of
which
comes
from
joy
not
fear
sex
therefore
is
an
animal
function
one
admits
one
insists
it
may
be
only
that
but
also
in
the
bewildering
and
humorous
and
tragic
duality
of
all
life
energies
it
is
the
bridge
to
every
eternity
which
is
not
merely
a
spectral
condition
of
earth
disembowelled
of
its
lusts
for
sex
holds
the
substance
of
the
image
but
we
must
remember
with
heine
that
aristophanes
is
the
god
of
this
ironic
earth
and
that
all
argument
is
apparently
vitiated
from
the
start
by
the
simple
fact
that
wagner
and
a
rooster
are
given
an
analogous
method
of
making
love
and
therefore
it
seems
impeccable
logic
to
say
that
all
that
is
most
unlike
the
rooster
is
the
most
spiritual
part
of
love
all
will
agree
on
that
schisms
only
arise
when
one
tries
to
decide
what
does
go
farthest
from
the
bird
automatic
mechanism
certainly
not
a
affair
which
is
only
the
negation
of
the
rooster
in
terms
of
the
swooning
bombast
of
adolescence
the
first
onslaught
of
a
force
which
the
sufferer
can
not
control
or
inhabit
with
all
the
potentialities
of
his
body
and
soul
but
the
rooster
is
troubled
by
no
dreams
of
a
divine
orgy
no
like
beethoven
no
heroic
and
shining
lust
gathering
and
swinging
into
a
merry
embrace
like
the
third
act
of
it
is
desire
in
this
sense
that
goes
farthest
from
the
animal
consciously
no
one
can
achieve
the
act
of
love
on
earth
as
a
completed
thing
of
grace
with
whatever
delirium
of
delight
with
whatever
ingenious
preciosity
we
go
through
its
process
only
as
an
image
of
beauty
mated
in
some
strange
hermaphroditic
ecstasy
is
that
possible
i
mean
only
as
a
dream
projected
into
a
hypothetical
a
real
heaven
but
on
earth
we
can
not
complete
the
cycle
in
consciousness
that
would
give
us
the
freedom
of
an
image
in
which
two
identities
mysteriously
realize
their
separate
unities
by
the
absorption
of
a
third
thing
the
constructive
rhythm
of
a
work
of
art
it
is
thus
that
tristan
and
isolde
become
wholly
distinct
individuals
yet
wholly
submerged
in
the
unity
that
is
wagner
and
so
reconcile
life
duality
by
balancing
its
opposing
laughters
in
a
definite
form
thereby
sending
out
into
life
a
profounder
duality
than
existed
before
a
platonic
equipoise
nietzsche
eternal
recurrence
the
only
real
philosophic
problem
therefore
one
of
which
these
two
philosophers
alone
are
aware
but
though
wagner
with
mathilde
wesendonck
in
his
arms
was
tristan
in
the
arms
of
isolde
he
did
not
find
a
melody
instead
of
a
kiss
on
his
lips
he
did
not
find
a
progression
of
harmonies
melting
through
the
contours
of
a
warm
beauty
with
a
blur
of
desperate
ecstasies
semitones
of
desire
he
found
only
the
anxious
happiness
of
any
other
lover
nevertheless
he
was
gathering
the
substance
of
the
second
act
of
und
and
it
is
this
that
plato
means
when
he
says
that
fornication
is
something
immortal
in
mortality
he
does
not
mean
that
the
act
itself
is
a
godlike
thing
a
claim
which
any
bedroom
mirror
would
quickly
deride
he
means
that
it
is
a
symbol
an
essential
condition
and
a
part
of
something
that
goes
deeper
into
life
than
any
geometry
of
earth
absurd
passionate
futile
and
very
necessary
antics
would
suggest
it
is
a
universal
fallacy
that
because
works
like
the
comedies
of
aristophanes
discuss
certain
social
or
ethical
problems
they
are
inspired
by
them
aristophanes
wrote
to
express
his
vision
on
life
his
delight
in
life
itself
seen
behind
the
warping
screen
of
contemporary
event
and
for
his
purposes
anything
from
euripides
to
cleon
served
as
ground
work
not
that
he
would
think
in
those
terms
naturally
but
the
rationalizing
process
that
goes
on
in
consciousness
during
the
creation
of
a
work
of
art
for
all
its
appearance
of
directing
matters
is
the
merest
weathercock
in
the
wind
of
the
subconscious
intention
as
an
example
of
how
utterly
it
is
possible
to
misunderstand
the
springs
of
inspiration
in
a
poem
we
may
take
the
following
remark
of
b
rogers
is
much
to
be
regretted
that
the
phallus
element
should
be
so
conspicuous
in
this
play
this
coarseness
so
repulsive
to
ourselves
was
introduced
it
is
impossible
to
doubt
for
the
express
purpose
of
the
extreme
earnestness
and
gravity
of
the
it
seems
so
logical
so
irrefutable
and
so
completely
misinterprets
every
creative
force
of
aristophanes
psyche
that
it
certainly
deserves
a
little
admiration
it
is
in
the
best
academic
tradition
and
everyone
respects
a
man
for
writing
so
mendaciously
the
effort
of
these
castrators
is
always
to
show
that
the
parts
considered
offensive
are
not
the
natural
expression
of
the
poet
that
they
are
dictated
externally
they
argue
that
shakespeare
coarseness
is
the
result
of
the
age
and
not
personal
predilection
completely
ignoring
the
work
of
men
like
sir
philip
sidney
and
spenser
indeed
practically
all
the
writers
in
whom
none
of
this
grossness
exists
shakespeare
wrote
sculduddery
because
he
liked
it
and
for
no
other
reason
his
sensuality
is
the
measure
of
his
vitality
these
liars
pretend
similarly
that
because
rabelais
had
a
humanistic
reason
for
much
of
his
work
the
destructior
mediaevalism
and
the
church
which
purpose
they
construe
of
course
as
an
effort
to
purify
therefore
he
only
put
the
lewdery
to
make
the
rest
palatable
when
it
should
be
obvious
even
to
an
academic
how
he
glories
in
his
wild
humour
what
the
academic
can
not
understand
is
that
in
such
works
while
attacking
certain
conditions
the
creative
power
of
the
vigorous
spirits
is
so
great
that
it
overflows
and
saturates
the
intellectual
conception
with
their
own
passionate
sense
of
life
it
is
for
this
reason
that
these
works
have
an
eternal
significance
if
rabelais
were
merely
a
social
reformer
then
the
value
of
his
work
would
not
have
outlived
his
generation
if
were
but
a
wise
political
tract
it
would
have
merely
an
historical
interest
and
it
would
have
ceased
spiritually
at
but
panurge
is
as
fantastic
and
fascinating
a
character
now
as
he
was
years
ago
lysistrata
and
her
girls
as
freshly
bodied
as
any
girl
kissed
therefore
the
serious
part
of
the
play
is
that
which
deals
with
them
the
frivolous
part
that
in
which
rogers
detects
gravity
and
earnestness
aristophanes
is
the
lord
of
all
who
take
life
as
a
gay
adventure
who
defy
all
efforts
to
turn
life
into
a
social
economic
or
moral
abstraction
is
it
therefore
just
that
the
critics
who
by
some
dark
instinct
unerringly
pick
out
the
exact
opposite
of
any
creator
real
virtues
as
his
chief
characteristics
should
praise
him
as
an
idealistic
reformer
an
ideal
state
of
society
was
the
last
thing
aristophanes
desired
he
wished
certainly
to
eliminate
inhumanities
and
baseness
but
only
that
there
might
be
free
play
for
laughter
for
individual
happiness
consequently
the
critics
lay
the
emphasis
on
the
effort
to
cleanse
society
not
the
method
of
laughter
aristophanes
wished
to
destroy
cleon
because
that
demagogue
failed
to
realize
the
poet
conception
of
dignified
government
and
tended
to
upset
the
stability
of
hellas
but
it
was
the
stability
of
life
the
vindication
of
all
individual
freedoms
in
which
he
was
ultimately
interested

i
felt
over
and
turned
this
way
and
that
for
sleepless
nights
calonice
it
must
be
fine
to
stand
such
long
attention
lysistrata
so
fine
it
comes
to
this
greece
saved
by
woman
calonice
by
woman
wretched
thing
i
sorry
for
it
lysistrata
our
country
fate
is
henceforth
in
our
hands
to
destroy
the
peloponnesians
root
and
branch
calonice
what
could
be
nobler
lysistrata
wipe
out
the
boeotians
calonice
not
utterly
have
mercy
on
the
eels
footnote
the
boeotian
eels
were
highly
esteemed
delicacies
in
athens
lysistrata
but
with
regard
to
athens
note
i
careful
not
to
say
any
of
these
nasty
things
still
thought
is
free
but
if
the
women
join
us
from
peloponnesus
and
boeotia
then
hand
in
hand
we
rescue
greece
calonice
how
could
we
do
such
a
big
wise
deed
we
women
who
dwell
quietly
adorning
ourselves
in
a
with
gowns
of
lucid
gold
and
gawdy
toilets
of
stately
silk
and
dainty
little
slippers
lysistrata
these
are
the
very
armaments
of
the
rescue
these
this
outlay
of
the
best
myrrh
slippers
cosmetics
dusting
beauty
and
robes
with
rippling
creases
of
light
calonice
yes
but
how
lysistrata
no
man
will
lift
a
lance
against
another
calonice
i
run
to
have
my
tunic
dyed
crocus
lysistrata
or
take
a
shield
calonice
i
get
a
stately
gown
lysistrata
or
unscabbard
a
sword
calonice
let
me
buy
a
pair
of
slipper
lysistrata
now
tell
me
are
the
women
right
to
lag
calonice
they
should
have
turned
birds
they
should
have
grown
wings
and
flown
lysistrata
my
friend
you
see
that
they
are
true
athenians
always
too
late
why
there
not
a
woman
from
the
shoreward
demes
arrived
not
one
from
salamis
calonice
i
know
for
certain
they
awoke
at
dawn
and
got
their
husbands
up
if
not
their
boat
sails
lysistrata
and
i
have
staked
my
life
the
acharnian
dames
would
be
here
first
yet
they
have
come
either
calonice
well
anyhow
there
is
theagenes
wife
we
can
expect
she
consulted
hecate
but
look
here
are
some
at
last
and
more
behind
them
see
where
are
they
from
calonice
from
anagyra
they
come
lysistrata
yes
they
generally
manage
to
come
first
myrrhine
myrrhine
are
we
late
lysistrata
what
is
that
nothing
to
say
lysistrata
i
not
much
to
say
for
you
myrrhine
dawdling
on
so
vast
an
affair
myrrhine
i
could
find
my
girdle
in
the
dark
but
if
the
affair
so
wonderful
tell
us
what
is
it
lysistrata
no
let
us
stay
a
little
longer
till
the
peloponnesian
girls
and
the
girls
of
bocotia
are
here
to
listen
myrrhine
that
the
best
advice
ah
there
comes
lampito
lampito
lysistrata
welcome
lampito
dear
spartan
girl
with
a
delightful
face
washed
with
the
rosy
spring
how
fresh
you
look
in
the
easy
stride
of
your
sleek
slenderness
why
you
could
strangle
a
bull
lampito
i
think
i
could
it
frae
exercise
and
kicking
high
behint
footnote
the
translator
has
put
the
speech
of
the
spartan
characters
in
scotch
dialect
which
is
related
to
english
about
as
was
the
spartan
dialect
to
the
speech
of
athens
the
spartans
in
their
character
anticipated
the
shrewd
canny
uncouth
scotch
highlander
of
modern
times
lysistrata
what
lovely
breasts
to
own
lampito
oo
your
fingers
assess
them
ye
tickler
wi
such
tender
chucks
i
feel
as
if
i
were
an
lysistrata
who
is
this
youngster
lampito
a
boeotian
lady
lysistrata
there
never
was
much
undergrowth
in
boeotia
such
a
smooth
place
and
this
girl
takes
after
it
calonice
yes
i
never
saw
a
skin
so
primly
kept
lysistrata
this
girl
lampito
a
sonsie
jinker
she
a
corinthian
lysistrata
yes
is
she
very
open
in
some
ways
particularly
lampito
but
who
garred
this
council
o
women
to
meet
here
lysistrata
i
have
lampito
propound
then
what
you
want
o
us
myrrhine
what
is
the
amazing
news
you
have
to
tell
lysistrata
i
tell
you
but
first
answer
one
small
question
myrrhine
as
you
like
lysistrata
are
you
not
sad
your
children
fathers
go
endlessly
off
soldiering
afar
in
this
plodding
war
i
am
willing
to
wager
there
not
one
here
whose
husband
is
at
home
calonice
mine
been
in
thrace
keeping
an
eye
on
eucrates
for
five
months
past
myrrhine
and
mine
left
me
for
pylos
seven
months
ago
at
least
lampito
and
as
for
mine
no
sooner
has
he
slipped
out
frae
the
line
he
straps
his
shield
and
he
snickt
off
again
lysistrata
and
not
the
slightest
glitter
of
a
lover
and
since
the
milesians
betrayed
us
i
not
seen
the
image
of
a
single
upright
man
to
be
a
marble
consolation
to
us
now
will
you
help
me
if
i
find
a
means
to
stamp
the
war
out
myrrhine
by
the
two
goddesses
yes
i
will
though
i
to
pawn
this
very
dress
and
drink
the
the
same
day
calonice
and
i
too
though
i
split
up
like
a
turbot
and
half
is
hackt
off
as
the
price
of
peace
lampito
and
i
too
why
to
get
a
peep
at
the
shy
thing
i
clamber
up
to
the
o
taygetus
lysistrata
then
i
expose
my
mighty
mystery
o
women
if
we
would
compel
the
men
to
bow
to
peace
we
must
refrain
myrrhine
from
what
o
tell
us
lysistrata
will
you
truly
do
it
then
myrrhine
we
will
we
will
if
we
must
die
for
it
lysistrata
we
must
refrain
from
every
depth
of
love
why
do
you
turn
your
backs
where
are
you
going
why
do
you
bite
your
lips
and
shake
your
heads
why
are
your
faces
blanched
why
do
you
weep
will
you
or
wo
you
or
what
do
you
mean
myrrhine
no
i
wo
do
it
let
the
war
proceed
calonice
no
i
wo
do
it
let
the
war
proceed
lysistrata
you
too
dear
turbot
you
that
said
just
now
you
did
mind
being
split
right
up
in
the
least
calonice
anything
else
o
bid
me
walk
in
fire
but
do
not
rob
us
of
that
darling
joy
what
else
is
like
it
dearest
lysistrata
lysistrata
and
you
myrrhine
o
please
give
me
the
fire
instead
lysistrata
lewd
to
the
least
drop
in
the
tiniest
vein
our
sex
is
fitly
food
for
tragic
poets
our
whole
life
but
a
pile
of
kisses
and
babies
but
hardy
spartan
if
you
join
with
me
all
may
be
righted
yet
o
help
me
help
me
lampito
it
a
sair
sair
thing
to
ask
of
us
by
the
twa
a
lass
to
sleep
her
lane
and
never
fill
love
lack
except
wi
makeshifts
but
let
it
be
peace
maun
be
thought
of
first
lysistrata
my
friend
my
friend
the
only
one
amid
this
herd
of
weaklings
calonice
but
if
which
heaven
forbid
we
should
refrain
as
you
would
have
us
how
is
peace
induced
lysistrata
by
the
two
goddesses
now
ca
you
see
all
we
have
to
do
is
idly
sit
indoors
with
smooth
roses
powdered
on
our
cheeks
our
bodies
burning
naked
through
the
folds
of
shining
amorgos
silk
and
meet
the
men
with
our
dear
plucked
trim
and
neat
their
stirring
love
will
rise
up
furiously
they
beg
our
arms
to
open
that
our
time
we
disregard
their
knocking
beat
them
off
and
they
will
soon
be
rabid
for
a
peace
i
sure
of
it
lampito
just
as
menelaus
they
say
seeing
the
bosom
of
his
naked
helen
flang
down
the
sword
calonice
but
we
be
tearful
fools
if
our
husbands
take
us
at
our
word
and
leave
us
lysistrata
there
only
left
then
in
pherecrates
phrase
flay
a
skinned
flay
more
our
flayed
desires
calonice
bah
proverbs
will
never
warm
a
celibate
but
what
avail
will
your
scheme
be
if
the
men
drag
us
for
all
our
kicking
on
to
the
couch
lysistrata
cling
to
the
doorposts
calonice
but
if
they
should
force
us
lysistrata
yield
then
but
with
a
sluggish
cold
indifference
there
is
no
joy
to
them
in
sullen
mating
besides
we
have
other
ways
to
madden
them
they
can
not
stand
up
long
and
they
no
delight
unless
we
fit
their
aim
with
merry
succour
calonice
well
if
you
must
have
it
so
we
all
agree
lampito
for
us
i
ha
no
doubt
we
can
persuade
our
men
to
strike
a
fair
an
decent
peace
but
how
will
ye
pitch
out
the
o
the
athenian
populace
lysistrata
i
promise
you
we
wither
up
that
curse
lampito
i
do
believe
it
not
while
they
own
ane
trireme
oared
an
rigged
or
a
those
stacks
an
stacks
an
stacks
o
siller
lysistrata
i
thought
the
whole
thing
out
till
there
no
flaw
we
shall
surprise
the
acropolis
today
that
is
the
duty
set
the
older
dames
while
we
sit
here
talking
they
are
to
go
and
under
pretence
of
sacrificing
seize
it
lampito
certie
that
fine
all
working
for
the
best
lysistrata
now
quickly
lampito
let
us
tie
ourselves
to
this
high
purpose
as
tightly
as
the
hemp
of
words
can
knot
together
lampito
set
out
the
terms
in
detail
and
we
a
swear
to
them
lysistrata
of
course
well
then
where
is
our
scythianess
why
are
you
staring
first
lay
the
shield
boss
downward
on
the
floor
and
bring
the
victim
inwards
cailonice
but
lysistrata
what
is
this
oath
that
we
to
swear
lysistrata
what
oath
in
aeschylus
they
take
a
slaughtered
sheep
and
swear
upon
a
buckler
why
not
we
calonice
o
lysistrata
peace
sworn
on
a
buckler
lysistrata
what
oath
would
suit
us
then
calonice
something
burden
bearing
would
be
our
best
insignia
a
white
horse
let
swear
upon
its
entrails
lysistrata
a
horse
indeed
calonice
then
what
will
symbolise
us
lysistrata
this
as
i
tell
you
first
set
a
great
dark
bowl
upon
the
ground
and
disembowel
a
skin
of
thasian
wine
then
swear
that
we
not
add
a
drop
of
water
lampito
ah
what
aith
could
clink
pleasanter
than
that
lysistrata
bring
me
a
bowl
then
and
a
skin
of
wine
calonice
my
dears
see
what
a
splendid
bowl
it
is
i
not
say
no
if
asked
to
sip
it
off
lysistrata
put
down
the
bowl
lay
hands
all
on
the
victim
skiey
queen
who
givest
the
last
word
in
arguments
and
thee
o
bowl
dear
comrade
we
beseech
accept
our
oblation
and
be
propitious
to
us
calonice
what
healthy
blood
la
how
it
gushes
out
lampito
an
what
a
leesome
fragrance
through
the
air
lysistrata
now
dears
if
you
will
let
me
i
speak
first
calonice
only
if
you
draw
the
lot
by
aphrodite
lysistrata
so
grasp
the
brim
you
lampito
and
all
you
calonice
repeat
for
the
rest
each
word
i
say
then
you
must
all
take
oath
and
pledge
your
arms
to
the
same
stern
conditions
lysistrata
to
husband
or
lover
i
not
open
arms
calonice
husband
or
lover
i
not
open
lysistrata
though
love
and
denial
may
enlarge
his
charms
calonice
love
and
denial
may
enlarge
his
o
o
my
knees
are
failing
me
lysistrata
lysistrata
but
still
at
home
ignoring
him
i
stay
calonice
still
at
home
ignoring
him
i
stay
lysistrata
beautiful
clad
in
saffron
silks
all

clad
in
saffron
silks
all
lysistrata
if
then
he
seizes
me
by
dint
of
force
calonice
then
he
seizes
me
by
dint
of
force
lysistrata
i
give
him
reason
for
a
long
remorse
calonice
give
him
reason
for
a
long
lysistrata
i
never
lie
and
stare
up
at
the
ceiling
calonice
never
lie
and
stare
up
at
the
ceiling
lysistrata
nor
like
a
lion
on
all
fours
go
kneeling
calonice
like
a
lion
on
all
fours
go
lysistrata
if
i
keep
faith
then
bounteous
cups
be
mine
calonice
i
keep
faith
then
bounteous
cups
be
lysistrata
if
not
to
nauseous
water
change
this
wine
calonice
not
to
nauseous
water
change
this
lysistrata
do
you
all
swear
to
this
myrrhine
we
do
we
do
lysistrata
then
i
shall
immolate
the
victim
thus
calonice
here
now
share
fair
have
we
made
a
pact
let
all
quaff
down
that
friendship
in
our
turn
lampito
hark
what
caterwauling
hubbub
that
lysistrata
as
i
told
you
the
women
have
appropriated
the
citadel
so
lampito
dash
off
to
your
own
land
and
raise
the
rebels
there
these
will
serve
as
hostages
while
we
ourselves
take
our
places
in
the
ranks
and
drive
the
bolts
right
home
calonice
but
wo
the
men
march
straight
against
us
lysistrata
and
what
if
they
do
no
threat
shall
creak
our
hinges
wide
no
torch
shall
light
a
fear
in
us
we
will
come
out
to
peace
alone
calonice
that
it
by
aphrodite
as
of
old
let
us
seem
hard
and
obdurate
lampito
some
go
off
the
others
go
up
into
the
old
men
to
attack
the
captured
make
room
draces
move
ahead
why
your
shoulder
chafed
i
see
with
lugging
uphill
these
lopped
branches
of
the
how
and
a
long
life
sees
things
grow
ah
strymodorus
who
have
thought
affairs
could
tangle
so
the
women
whom
at
home
we
fed
like
witless
fools
with
fostering
bread
have
impiously
come
to
this
they
stolen
the
acropolis
with
bolts
and
bars
our
orders
flout
and
shut
us
out
come
philurgus
bustle
thither
lay
our
faggots
on
the
ground
in
neat
stacks
beleaguering
the
insurgents
all
around
and
the
vile
conspiratresses
plotters
of
such
mischief
dire
pile
and
burn
them
all
together
in
one
vast
and
righteous
pyre
fling
with
our
own
hands
lycon
wife
to
fry
in
the
thickest
fire
by
demeter
they
get
no
brag
while
i
a
vein
to
beat
cleomenes
himself
was
hurtled
out
in
sore
defeat
his
spartan
pride
was
bent
out
stripped
of
all
his
arms
he
went
a
pigmy
cloak
that
would
not
stretch
to
hide
his
rump
the
draggled
wretch
six
sprouting
years
of
beard
the
spilth
of
six
years
filth
that
was
a
siege
our
men
were
ranged
in
lines
of
seventeen
deep
before
the
gates
and
never
left
their
posts
there
even
to
sleep
shall
i
not
smite
the
rash
presumption
then
of
foes
like
these
detested
both
of
all
the
gods
and
of
euripides
else
may
the
not
boast
my
trophied
victories
ah
now
there
but
a
little
space
to
reach
the
place
a
deadly
climb
it
is
a
tricky
road
with
all
this
bumping
load
a
soon
would
tire
how
these
logs
bruise
my
shoulders
further
still
jog
up
the
hill
and
puff
the
fire
inside
or
just
as
we
reach
the
top
we
find
it
died
ough
phew
i
choke
with
the
smoke
lord
heracles
how
out
of
the
pot
this
smoke
leaps
worrying
me
and
biting
angrily
lemnian
fire
that
smokes
or
else
it
would
not
sting
my
eyelids
thus
haste
all
of
us
athene
invokes
our
aid
laches
now
or
never
the
assault
must
be
made
ough
phew
i
choke
with
the
smoke
thanked
be
the
gods
the
fire
peeps
up
and
crackles
as
it
should
now
why
not
first
slide
off
our
backs
these
weary
loads
of
wood
and
dip
a
in
the
brazier
till
it
glows
then
straight
hurl
it
at
the
against
the
stubborn
gate
if
they
refuse
to
draw
the
bolts
in
immediate
compliance
we
set
fire
to
the
wood
and
smoke
will
strangle
their
defiance
phew
what
a
spluttering
drench
of
smoke
come
now
from
off
my
back
is
there
no
to
help
me
to
unpack
ah
there
that
over
for
the
last
time
now
it
galled
my
shoulder
flare
up
thine
embers
brazier
and
dutifully
smoulder
to
kindle
a
brand
that
i
the
first

well
all
the

in

silence
we
knew
how
wretchedly
everything
still
was
progressing
by
listening
dumbly
the
day
long
to
you
for
always
at
home
you
continued
discussing
the
war
and
its
politics
loudly
and
we
sometimes
would
ask
you
our
hearts
deep
with
sorrowing
though
we
spoke
lightly
though
happy
to
see
what
to
be
inscribed
on
the

so
i
did
nothing

sit
in

house
feeling
dreary
and
sigh
while
ever
arrived
some
fresh
tale
of
decisions
more
foolish
by
far
and
presaging
disaster
then
i
would
say
to
him
o
my
dear
husband
why
still
do
they
rush
on
destruction
the
faster
at
which
he
would
look
at
me
sideways
exclaiming
keep
for
your

your

for
some

hence
your

when
at
the
last
in

ominous
cry

bought
steaming
from
an
old
woman
who
kept
a
nearby
a
soldier
a
thracian
was
shaking
wildly
his
spear
like
tereus
in
the
play
to
frighten
a
while
unseen
the
ruffian
filched
from
her
the
ripest
away
magistrate
how
may
i
ask
will
your
rule
order
and
justice
in
lands
so
tormented
lysistrata
nothing
is
easier
magistrate
out
with
it
speedily
what
is
this
plan
that
you
boast
you
invented
lysistrata
if
when
yarn
we
are
winding
it
chances
to
tangle
then
as
perchance
you
may
know
through
the
skein
this
way
and
that
still
the
spool
we
keep
passing
till
it
is
finally
clear
all
again
so
to
untangle
the
war
and
its
errors
ambassadors
out
on
all
sides
we
will
send
this
way
and
that
here
there
and
round
about
soon
you
will
find
that
the
war
has
an
end
magistrate
so
with
these
trivial
tricks
of
the
household
domestic
analogies
of
threads
skeins
and
spools
you
think
that
you
solve
such
a
bitter
complexity
unwind
such
political
problems
you
fools
lysistrata
well
first
as
we
wash
dirty
wool
so
to
cleanse
it
so
with
a
pitiless
zeal
we
will
scrub
through
the
whole
city
for
all
greasy
fellows
burrs
too
the
parasites
off
we
will
rub
that
verminous
plague
of
insensate
soon
between
thumb
and
forefinger
we
crack
all
who
inside
athens
walls
have
their
dwelling
into
one
great
common
basket
we
pack
disenfranchised
or
citizens
allies
or
aliens
the
lot
of
them
in
we
will
squeeze
till
they
discover
humanity
meaning
as
for
disjointed
and
far
colonies
them
you
must
never
from
this
time
imagine
as
scattered
about
just
like
lost
hanks
of
wool
each
portion
we
take
and
wind
in
to
this
centre
inward
to
athens
each
loyalty
pull
till
from
the
vast
heap
where
all
piled
together
at
last
can
be
woven
a
strong
cloak
of
state
magistrate
how
terrible
is
it
to
stand
here
and
watch
them
carding
and
winding
at
will
with
our
fate
witless
in
war
as
they
are
lysistrata
what
of
us
then
who
ever
in
vain
for
our
children
must
weep
borne
but
to
perish
afar
and
in
vain
magistrate
not
that
o
let
that
one
memory
sleep
lysistrata
then
while
we
should
be
companioned
still
merrily
happy
as
brides
may
the
livelong
night
kissing
youth
by
we
are
forced
to
lie
single
but
leave
for
a
moment
our
pitiful
plight
it
hurts
even
more
to
behold
the
poor
maidens
helpless
wrinkling
in
staler
virginity
magistrate
does
not
a
man
age
lysistrata
not
in
the
same
way
not
as
a
woman
grows
withered
grows
he
he
when
returned
from
the
war
though
yet
if
he
wishes
can
choose
out
a
wife
but
she
has
no
solace
save
peering
for
omens
wretched
and
lonely
the
rest
of
her
life
magistrate
but
the
old
man
will
often
select
lysistrata
o
why
not
finish
and
die
a
bier
is
easy
to
buy
a
i
knead
you
with
joy
this
garland
will
see
you
are
decked
calonice
i
a
wreath
for
you
too
myrrhine
i
also
will
fillet
you
lysistrata
what
more
is
lacking
step
aboard
the
boat
see
charon
shouts
ahoy
you
keeping
him
he
wants
to
shove
afloat
magistrate
outrageous
insults
thus
my
place
to
flout
now
to
my
i
go
and
what
you
perpetrated
on
me
show
lysistrata
why
are
you
blaming
us
for
laying
you
out
assure
yourself
we
not
forget
to
make
the
third
day
offering
early
for
your
sake
magistrate
lysistrata
old
men
all
men
who
call
your
loins
your
own
awake
at
last
arise
and
strip
to
stand
in
readiness
for
as
it
seems
to
me
some
more
perilous
offensive
in
their
heads
they
now
devise
i
sure
a
tyranny
like
that
of
hippias
in
this
i
detect
they
mean
to
put
us
under
themselves
i
suspect
and
that
laconians
assembling
at
cleisthenes
house
have
played
a
and
provoked
them
madly
to
raid
the
treasury
in
which
term
i
include
the
pay
for
my
food
for
is
it
not
preposterous
they
should
talk
this
way
to
us
on
a
subject
such
as
battle
and
women
as
they
are
about
bronze
bucklers
dare
prattle
make
alliance
with
the
spartans
people
i
for
one
like
very
hungry
wolves
would
always
most
sincere
shun
some
dirty
game
is
up
their
sleeve
i
believe
a
tyranny
no
doubt
but
they
wo
catch
me
that
know
henceforth
on
my
guard
i
go
a
sword
with
wreathed
for
ever
in
my
hand
and
under
arms
in
the
public
place
i
take
my
watchful
stand
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
aristogeiton
now
my
staff
i
draw
and
start
at
once
by
knocking
that
shocking
hag
upon
the
jaw
women
your
own
mother
will
not
know
you
when
you
get
back
to
the
town
but
first
my
friends
and
allies
let
us
lay
these
garments
down
and
all
ye
hark
to
me
while
i
tell
what
will
aid
athens
well
just
as
is
right
for
i
have
been
a
sharer
in
all
the
lavish
splendour
of
the
proud
city
i
bore
the
holy
vessels
at
seven
then
i
pounded
barley
at
the
age
of
ten
and
clad
in
yellow
robes
soon
after
this
i
was
little
bear
to
brauronian
artemis
then
neckletted
with
figs
grown
tall
and
pretty
i
was
a
and
so
it
obvious
i
should
give
you
advice
that
i
think
good
the
very
best
i
can
it
should
not
prejudice
my
voice
that
i
not
born
a
man
if
i
say
something
advantageous
to
the
present
situation
for
i
taxed
too
and
as
a
toll
provide
men
for
the
nation
while
miserable
greybeards
you
it
is
true
contribute
nothing
of
any
importance
whatever
to
our
needs
but
the
treasure
raised
against
the
medes
you
squandered
and
do
nothing
in
return
save
that
you
make
our
lives
and
persons
hazardous
by
some
imbecile
mistakes
what
can
you
answer
now
be
careful
do
arouse
my
spite
or
with
my
slipper
i
take
you
napping
faces
slapping
left
and
right
men
what
villainies
they
contrive
come
let
vengeance
fall
you
that
below
the
waist
are
still
alive
off
with
your
tunics
at
my
call
naked
all
for
a
man
must
strip
to
battle
like
a
man
no
quaking
brave
steps
taking
careless
what
ahead
white
shoed
in
the
nude
onward
bold
all
ye
who
garrisoned
leipsidrion
of
old
let
each
one
wag
as
youthfully
as
he
can
and
if
he
has
the
cause
at
heart
rise
at
least
a
span
we
must
take
a
stand
and
keep
to
it
for
if
we
yield
the
smallest
bit
to
their
importunity
then
nowhere
from
their
inroads
will
be
left
to
us
immunity
but
they
be
building
ships
and
soon
their
navies
will
attack
us
as
artemisia
did
and
seek
to
fight
us
and
to
sack
us
and
if
they
mount
the
knights
they
rob
of
a
job
for
everyone
knows
how
talented
they
all
are
in
the
saddle
having
long
practised
how
to
straddle
no
matter
how
they
jogged
there
up
and
down
they
never
thrown
then
think
of
myron
painting
and
each
amazon
in
combat
with
men
come
on
these
women
fall
and
in
pierced
let
stick
quick
the
necks
of
one
and
all
women
do
cross
me
or
i
loose
the
beast
that
kennelled
here
and
soon
you
will
be
howling
for
a
truce
howling
out
with
fear
but
my
dear
strip
also
that
women
may
battle
unhindered
but
you
you
be
too
sore
to
eat
garlic
more
or
one
black
bean
i
really
mean
so
great
my
spleen
to
kick
you
black
and
blue
with
these
my
dangerous
legs
i
hatch
the
lot
of
you
if
my
rage
you
dash
on
the
way
the
relentless
beetle
hatched
the
eagle
eggs
scornfully
aside
i
set
every
silly
threat
while
lampito
with
me
or

ismenia
the
noble
theban

then
let
decree

hotly
piled
upon

be
your
labours
you
futile
rogue
abominated
by
your
suffering
neighbour

i
yesterday
went
off

sent
to
our
neighbours
in
boeotia
asking
as
a
gift
to
me
for
them
to
pack
immediately
that
darling
dainty
thing
a
good
fat
eel
i
meant
of
course
footnote

but
they
refused
because
some
idiotic
old
decree
in
force
o
this
strange
passion
for
decrees
nothing
on
earth
can
check
till
someone
puts
a
foot
out
tripping
you
and
slipping
you
break
your
neck
lysistrata
in

of
our
martial
enterprise

the
gaping
calamity

can
not
shut
their
ravenous
appetites
a
moment
more
now
they
are
all
deserting
the
first
i
caught
was
sidling
through
the
postern
close
by
the
cave
of
pan

next
hoisting
herself
with
rope
and
pulley
down

birth
till
i
have
left
the
precincts
of

this
hard
lump
here

a
male
child
lysistrata
by
aphrodite

is
your

has
the
feel
of

i
soon
can
see
you
hussy
it
athene
sacred
helm
and
you
said
you
were
with
child
woman
and
so
i
am
lysistrata
then
why
the
helm
woman
so
if
the
throes
should
take
me
still
in
these
grounds
i
could
use
it
like
a
dove
as
a
in
which
to
drop
the
child
lysistrata
more
pretexts
you
ca
hide
your
clear
intent
and
anyway
why
not
wait
till
the
tenth
day
meditating
a
brazen
name
for
your
brass
brat
woman
and
i
ca
sleep
a
wink
my
nerve
is
gone
since
i
saw
that
of
the
shrine
woman
and
all
those
dreadful
owls
with
their
weird
hooting
though
i
wearied
out
i
ca
close
an
eye
lysistrata
you
wicked
women
cease
from
juggling
lies
you
want
your
men
but
what
of
them
as
well
they
toss
as
sleepless
in
the
lonely
night
i
sure
of
it
hold
out
awhile
hold
out
but
persevere
a
longer
an
oracle
has
promised
victory
if
we
do
wrangle
would
you
hear
the
words
women
yes
yes
what
is
it
lysistrata
silence
then
you
chatterboxes
here
the
swallows
flocking
in
one
place
from
the
hoopoes
deny
themselves
love
gambols
any
more
all
woes
shall
then
have
ending
and
great
zeus
the
thunderer
shall
put
above
what
was
below
women
will
the
men
then
always
be
kept
under
us
lysistrata
if
the
swallows
squabble
among
themselves
and
fly
away
out
of
the
temple
refusing
to
agree
then
the
most
wanton
birds
in
all
the

they
shall
be
named
for

it
obvious
what
it
means
lysistrata
now
by
all
the

we
must
let
no
agony
deter
from
duty

we
are
base
indeed
my
friends
if
we
betray
the
oracle

old
men
i
like
to
remind
you
of
a
fable
they

to
employ
when

little
boy
how
once
through
fear
of
the
a
young
man
melanion
by
name
to
the
wilderness
ran
and
there
on
the
hills
he
dwelt
for
hares
he
wove
a
net
which
with
his
dog
he
set
most
likely
he
there
yet
for
he
never
came
back
home
so
great
was
the
fear
he
felt
i
loathe
the
sex
as
much
as
he
and
therefore
i
no
less
shall
be
as
chaste
as
was
melanion

ways
to
shun
and
hide
from
everyone
spitting
out
curses
on
all
knavish
men
to
left

but
though
he
reared
this
hate
for
men
he
loved
the
women
even
then
and

and
left

with
an
anguished
pulse
men
baulked
in
your
amorous
delight
how
melancholy
is
your
plight
with
sympathy
your
case
i
view
for
i
am
sure
it
hard
on
you
what
human
being
could
sustain
this
unforeseen
domestic
strain
and
not
a
single
trace
of
willing
women
in
the
place
cinesias
o
zeus
what
throbbing
suffering
men
she
did
it
all
the
harlot
she
with
her
atrocious
harlotry
women
nay
rather
call
her
men
what
sweet
she
a
rude
wicked
thing
cinesias
a
wicked
thing
as
i
repeat
o
zeus
o
zeus
canst
thou
not
suddenly
let
loose
some
twirling
hurricane
to
tear
her
flapping
up
along
the
air
and
drop
her
when
she
whirled
around
here
to
the
ground
neatly
impaled
upon
the
stake
that
ready
upright
for
her
sake
goes
spartan
herald
magistrate
herald
what
here
gabs
the
senate
an
the
prytanes
i
fetcht
despatches
for
them
magistrate
are
you
a
man
or
a
monstrosity
herald
my
lad
i
a
herald
as
ye
see
who
hae
come
frae
sparta
anent
a
peace
magistrate
then
why
do
you
hide
that
lance
that
sticks
out
under
your
arms
herald
i
brought
no
lance
magistrate
then
why
do
you
turn
aside
and
hold
your
cloak
so
far
out
from
your
body
is
your
groin
swollen
with
stress
of
travelling
herald
by
castor
i
swear
the
man
is
wud
magistrate
indeed
your
cloak
is
wide
my
rascal
fellow
herald
but
i
tell
ye
no
enow
o
fleering
magistrate
well
what
is
it
then
herald
it
my
despatch
cane
magistrate
of
course
a
spartan
cane
but
speak
right
out
i
know
all
this
too
well
are
new
privations
springing
up
in
sparta
herald
och
hard
as
could
be
in
lofty
lusty
columns
our
allies
stand
united
we
maun
get
pellene
magistrate
whence
has
this
evil
come
is
it
from
pan
herald
no
lampito
first
ran
asklent
then
the
others
sprinted
after
her
example
and
blocked
the
hizzies
their
wames
unskaithed
against
our
every
fleech
magistrate
what
did
you
do
herald
we
are
broken
and
bent
double
limp
like
men
carrying
lanthorns
in
great
winds
about
the
city
they
winna
let
us
even
wi
lightest
neif
skim
their
primsie
pretties
till
we
concluded
wi
a
hellas
magistrate
so
the
conspiracy
is
universal
this
proves
it
then
return
to
sparta
bid
them
send
envoys
with
full
powers
to
treat
of
peace
and
i
will
urge
the
senate
here
to
choose
plenipotentiary
ambassadors
as
argument
adducing
this
connection
herald
i
off
your
wisdom
none
could
contravert
men
there
is
no
beast
no
rush
of
fire
like
woman
so
untamed
she
calmly
goes
her
way
where
even
panthers
would
be
shamed
women
and
yet
you
are
fool
enough
it
seems
to
dare
to
war
with
me
when
for
your
faithful
ally
you
might
win
me
easily
men
never
could
the
hate
i
feel
for
womankind
grow
less
women
then
have
your
will
but
i
take
pity
on
your
nakedness
for
i
can
see
just
how
ridiculous
you
look
and
so
will
help
you
with
your
tunic
if
close
up
i
now
may
go
men
well
that
by
zeus
is
no
i
frankly
will
admit
i
only
took
them
off
myself
in
a
scoundrel
women
now
you
look
sensible
and
that
you
men
no
one
could
doubt
if
you
were
but
good
friends

i
take
the
insect
out
that
hurts
your
eye
men

nasty
bitie
thing

squeeze
it
out
and
show
me
what
it
is
that
makes
this
sting
it
been
paining
me
a
long
while
now
women

i
agree
to
that
although
you
most
unmannerly
o
what
a
giant
gnat
here
look
it
comes
from
marshy
tricorysus
i
can
tell
men
o
thank

was
digging
out
a
veritable
well
now

i
ca

back
my
tears

kissed
women
o
yes

all
how
you
cajole
and
flatter
a
hell
it
is
to
live
with
you
to
live
without
a
hell
how
truly
was
that
said
but
come
these
enmities
let
quell
you
stop
from
giving
orders
and
i
stop
from
doing
wrong
so
let
join
ranks
and
seal
our
bargain
with
a
choric
song
chorus
athenians
it
not
our
intention
to
sow
political
dissension
by
giving
any
scandal
mention
but
on
the
contrary
to
promote
good
feeling
in
the
state
by
word
and
deed
we
had
enough
calamities
of
late
so
let
a
man
or
woman
but
divulge
they
need
a
trifle
say
two
minas
three
or
four
i
purses
here
that
bulge
there
only
one
condition
made
indulge
my
whim
in
this
i
pray
when
peace
is
signed
once
more
on
no
account
am
i
to
be
repaid
and
i
making
preparation
for
a
gay
select
collation
with
some
youths
of
reputation
i
managed
to
produce
some
soup
and
they
slaughtering
for
me
a
its
flesh
should
taste
as
tender
as
could
be
i
shall
expect
you
at
my
house
today
to
the
baths
make
an
early
visit
and
bring
your
children
along
do
dawdle
on
the
way
ask
no
one
enter
as
if
the
place
was
all
your
own
yours
henceforth
is
it
if
nothing
chances
wrong
the
door
will
then
be
shut
bang
in
your
face
spartan
ambassadors
chorus
here
come
the
spartan
envoys
with
long
worried
beards
hail
spartans
how
do
you
fare
did
anything
new
arise
spartans
no
need
for
a
clutter
o
words
do
ye
see
our
condition
chorus
the
situation
swells
to
greater
tension
something
will
explode
soon
spartans
it
awfu
truly
but
come
let
us
wi
the
best
speed
we
may
scribble
a
peace
chorus
i
notice
that
our
men
like
wrestlers
poised
for
contest
hold
their
clothes
out
from
their
bellies
an
athlete
malady
since
exercise
alone
can
bring
relief
athenians
can
anyone
tell
us
where
lysistrata
is
there
is
no
need
to
describe
our
men
condition
it
shows
up
plainly
enough
chorus
it
the
same
disease
do
you
feel
a
jerking
throbbing
in
the
morning
athenians
by
zeus
yes
in
these
straits
i
racked
all
through
unless
peace
is
soon
declared
we
shall
be
driven
in
the
void
of
women
to
try
cleisthenes
chorus
be
wise
and
cover
those
things
with
your
tunics
who
knows
what
kind
of
person
may
perceive
you
athenians
by
zeus
you
right
spartans
by
the
twa
goddesses
indeed
ye
are
let
put
our
tunics
on
athenians
hail
o
my
hail
spartans
spartans
o
hinnie
darling
what
a
waefu
thing
if
they
had
seen
us
wi
our
lunging
waddies
athenians
tell
us
then
spartans
what
has
brought
you
here
spartans
we
come
to
treat
o
peace
athenians
well
spoken
there
and
we
the
same
let
us
callout
lysistrata
since
she
alone
can
settle
the
spartans
callout
lysistratus
too
if
ye
do
mind
chorus
no
indeed
she
hears
your
voices
and
she
comes
hail
wonder
of
all
women
now
you
must
be
in
turn
hard
shifting
clear
deceitful
noble
crafty
sweet
and
stern
the
foremost
men
of
hellas
smitten
by
your
fascination
have
brought
their
tangled
quarrels
here
for
your
sole
arbitration
lysistrata
an
easy
task
if
the
love
raging
does
start
trying
out
how
well
each
other
will
serve
instead
of
us
but
i
know
at
once
if
they
do
o
where
that
girl
reconciliation
bring
first
before
me
the
spartan
delegates
and
see
you
lift
no
rude
or
violent
hands
none
of
the
churlish
ways
our
husbands
used
but
lead
them
courteously
as
women
should
and
if
they
grudge
fingers
guide
them
by
other
methods
and
introduce
them
with
ready
tact
the
athenians
draw
by
whatever
offers
you
a
grip
now
spartans
stay
here
facing
me
here
you
athenians
both
hearken
to
my
words
i
am
a
woman
but
i
not
a
fool
and
what
of
natural
intelligence
i
own
has
been
filled
out
with
the
remembered
precepts
my
father
and
the
taught
me
first
i
reproach
you
both
sides
equally
that
when
at
pylae
and
olympia
at
pytho
and
the
many
other
shrines
that
i
could
name
you
sprinkle
from
one
cup
the
altars
common
to
all
hellenes
yet
you
wrack
hellenic
cities
bloody
hellas
with
deaths
of
her
own
sons
while
yonder
clangs
the
gathering
menace
of
barbarians
athenians
we
can
not
hold
it
in
much
longer
now
lysistrata
now
unto
you
o
spartans
do
i
speak
do
you
forget
how
your
own
countryman
pericleidas
once
came
hither
suppliant
before
our
altars
pale
in
his
purple
robes
praying
for
an
army
when
in
messenia
danger
growled
and
the
made
earth
quaver
then
with
four
thousand
hoplites
cimon
marched
and
saved
all
sparta
yet
base
ingrates
now
you
are
ravaging
the
soil
of
your
preservers
athenians
by
zeus
they
do
great
wrong
lysistrata
spartans
great
wrong
indeed
o
what
a
luscious
wench
lysistrata
and
now
i
turn
to
the
athenians
have
you
forgotten
too
how
once
the
spartans
in
days
when
you
wore
slavish
tunics
came
and
with
their
spears
broke
a
thessalian
host
and
all
the
partisans
of
hippias
they
alone
stood
by
your
shoulder
on
that
day
they
freed
you
so
that
for
the
slave
short
skirt
you
should
wear
the
trailing
cloak
of
liberty
spartans
i
never
seen
a
nobler
woman
anywhere
athenians
nor
i
one
with
such
prettily
jointing
hips
lysistrata
now
brethren
twined
with
mutual
benefactions
can
you
still
war
can
you
suffer
such
disgrace
why
not
be
friends
what
is
there
to
prevent
you
spartans
we
agreed
gin
that
we
get
this
tempting
mole
lysistrata
which
one
spartans
that
ane
we
wanted
to
get
into
o
for
sae
lang
pylos
of
course
athenians
by
poseidon
never
lysistrata
give
it
up
athenians
then
what
will
we
do
we
need
that
ticklish
place
united
to
us
lysistrata
ask
for
some
other
in
return
athenians
then

so
that
we
miss
half
of
the
things
they
say
and
misinterpret
things
that
were
never
said
and
then
report
the
muddle
back
to
athens
but
now
we
charmed
with
each
other
they
might
cap
with
the
instead
of
the
cleitagora

we
