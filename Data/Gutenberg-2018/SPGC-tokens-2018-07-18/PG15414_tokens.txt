from

of
foreword
the
play
from
which
this
book
is
written
was
in
no
sense
of
the
word
intended
as
a
war
drama
for
war
is
merely
its
background
and
always
in
the
center
stands
a
lonely
little
child
war
is
its
theme
but
not
its
purpose
war
breeds
hatred
horror
pestilence
and
famine
yet
from
its
tears
and
ashes
eventually
must
rise
the
clean
white
spirit
of
humanity
the
enmity
between
north
and
south
is
dead
it
sleeps
with
the
fathers
and
the
sons
the
brothers
and
the
lovers
who
died
in
a
cause
which
each
believed
was
just
therefore
this
story
deals
not
with
the
right
or
wrong
of
a
lost
confederacy
but
with
the
mercy
and
generosity
the
chivalry
and
humanity
which
lived
in
the
hearts
of
the
blue
and
gray
a
noble
contrast
to
the
grim
brutality
of
war
the
author
is
indebted
to
moffat
who
has
novelized
the
play
directly
from
its
text
with
the
exception
of
that
portion
which
appeared
as
a
short
story
under
the
same
title
several
years
ago
treating
of
virgie
in
the
overseer
cabin
and
the
endorsing
of
her
pass
by
morrison
edward
peple
the
littlest
rebel
chapter
i
young
herbert
cary
picked
up
her
work
basket
and
slowly
crossed
the
grass
to
a
shady
bench
underneath
the
trees
she
must
go
on
with
her
task
of
planning
a
dress
for
virgie
but
the
prospect
of
making
her
daughter
something
wearable
out
of
the
odds
and
ends
of
nothing
was
not
a
happy
one
in
fact
she
was
still
poking
through
her
basket
and
frowning
thoughtfully
when
a
childish
voice
came
to
her
ears
yes
virgie
here
i
am
out
under
the
trees
immediately
came
a
sound
of
tumultuous
feet
and
miss
virginia
houston
cary
burst
upon
the
scene
she
was
a
tot
of
seven
with
sun
touched
hair
and
great
dark
eyes
whose
witchery
made
her
a
piquant
little
fairy
in
spite
of
her
mother
despair
over
her
clothes
virgie
was
dressed
or
at
least
had
been
dressed
at
breakfast
time
in
a
clean
white
frock
low
shoes
and
white
stockings
although
all
now
showed
signs
of
strenuous
usage
clutched
to
her
breast
as
she
ran
up
to
her
mother
side
was
susan
jemima
her
one
beloved
possession
and
her
doll
behind
virgie
came
sally
ann
her
playmate
a
slim
barefooted
mulatto
girl
whose
faded
gingham
dress
hung
partly
in
tatters
halfway
between
her
knees
and
ankles
in
one
of
sally
ann
hands
carried
like
a
sword
was
a
pointed
stick
in
the
other
a
long
piece
of
blue
from
which
dangled
a
bit
of
string
oh
mother
cried
the
small
daughter
of
the
carys
as
she
came
up
flushed
and
excited
what
do
you
reckon
sally
ann
and
me
have
been
playing
out
in
the
woods
what
dear
and
cary
gentle
hand
went
up
to
lift
the
hair
back
from
her
daughter
dampened
forehead
cried
virgie
with
rounded
eyes
blue
beard
echoed
her
mother
in
astonishment
at
this
childish
freak
of
amusement
not

on
this
hot
day

virgie
emphatically

state

cried
cary
in
well
feigned
amazement
at
the
timidity
of
the
various
blue
beards
and
then

the
last
time
he

then
as
her
mother
face
showed
signs
of
doubt
as
to
her
histrionic
ability
if
you
were
little
girl
i
do
it
in
a
minute
all
right
dear
of
course
i
will
but
i
just
remembered
a
bit
of
lace
in
your
grandmother
trunk
in
the
attic
i
believe
it
will
be
exactly
enough
for
the
neck
and
sleeves
of
your
new
dress
she
smiled
courageously
as
she
folded
a
piece
of
old
silk
she
was
remaking
you
and
she
cast
a
glance
at
sally
ann
your
respected
can
wait
a
few
moments
ca
you
you
might
rehearse
a
little
more
with
all
this
important
audience
of
solemn
oaks
you
would
want
to
make
the
slightest
slip
in
your
parts
that
so
agreed
virgie
raising
her
hands
and
clasping
her
tiny
fingers
thoughtfully
and
i
tell
you
what
we
mark
off
the
castle
walls
around
the
bench
where
the
window
going
to
be
we
ought
to
have
a
stage
come
on
sal
i
mean
blue
beard
pick
up
some
sticks
quick
cary
started
but
turned
back
an
instant
by
the
way
have
either
of
you
seen
uncle
billy
i
must
find
him
too
and
plan
something
for
our
lunch
i
seen
early
dis
mawnin
piped
blue
beard
makin
for
de
woods
i
reckon
he
be
back
very
well
answered
virgie
mother
a
shadow
creeping
into
her
face
as
she
went
on
toward
the
house
could
uncle
billy
possibly
be
leaving
the
most
trusted
negro
of
all
no
she
would
almost
as
soon
doubt
the
cause
itself
three
long
years
ago
war
had
seemed
a
thrilling
daring
necessity
caught
in
the
dreadful
net
of
circumstance
she
had
vowed
proudly
in
her
own
heart
never
to
be
less
brave
than
the
bravest
in
her
ears
still
rang
the
echo
of
that
first
from
far
away
a
faint
fanfare
of
trumpets
borne
on
brazen
wings
from
the
distant
clamor
of
the
city
streets
what
that
a
bugle
and
that
a
drum
tramp
the
rolling
thunder
of
ten
thousand
feet
has
been
declared
from
north
to
south
the
marching
lines
fill
the
land
a
sea
of
men
whose
flashing
bayonets
glisten
and
glitter
in
the
morning
light
with
steady
step
and
even
rank
with
thrill
of
brass
lunged
band
and
screaming
fife
the
regiments
sweep
by
in
front
the
officers
on
their
dancing
steeds
behind
them
line
after
line
of
youthful
faces
chins
in
chests
out
the
light
of
victory
already
shining
in
their
eyes
in
just
this
way
the
nation
sons
went
forth
to
fight
in
those
first
brave
days
of
just
so
they
marched
out
defiant
from
south
and
north
alike
each
side
eager
for
the
cause
he
thought
was
right
with
bright
pennons
snapping
in
the
breeze
and
bugles
blowing
gayly
and
never
a
thought
in
any
man
mind
but
that
side
would
win
and
his
own
life
be
spared
and
every
woman
too
waving
cheerful
farewell
to
valiant
lines
of
marching
gray
or
sturdy
ranks
of
blue
had
hoped
the
same
for
side
but
in
war
there
is
always
a
reckoning
to
pay
always
one
contender
driven
to
the
wall
his
cities
turned
to
ashes
his
lands
laid
waste
always
one
depleted
side
which
takes
one
last
desperate
stand
in
the
sight
of
blackened
homes
and
outraged
fields
and
fights
on
through
ever
darkening
days
until
the
inevitable
end
is
come
and
the
end
of
the
confederacy
was
now
almost
in
sight
three
years
of
fighting
and
the
seceding
states
had
been
cut
in
twain
their
armies
widely
separated
by
the
union
hosts
advancing
and
retreating
but
always
fighting
month
after
month
year
after
year
the
men
in
gray
had
come
at
last
to
the
bitterest
period
of
it
all
when
the
weakened
south
was
slowly
breaking
under
the
weight
of
her
brother
foes
when
the
two
greatest
of
the
armies
battled
on
virginia
soil
battled
and
passed
to
their
final
muster
roll
of
little
need
to
tell
of
the
privations
which
the
pivotal
state
of
the
confederacy
went
through
if
it
were
true
that
virginia
had
been
simply
one
vast
arsenal
where
every
inhabitant
had
unfailingly
done
his
part
in
making
war
it
was
also
true
that
she
had
furnished
many
of
its
greatest
battlefields
and
at
what
a
frightful
cost
everywhere
were
the
cruel
signs
of
destruction
and
want
in
scanty
larder
patched
refurbished
clothing
servantless
homes
in
dismantled
outhouses
broken
fences
and
neglected
fields
even
the
staples
of
life
were
fast
diminishing
for
every
man
who
could
shoulder
a
gun
had
gone
to
fight
with
lee
and
few
animals
were
left
and
fewer
slaves
yet
for
all
the
dismal
outlook
winter
had
passed
without
actual
disaster
to
the
confederate
arms
and
now
that
spring
had
come
the
plantation
home
of
the
herbert
carys
twenty
miles
below
richmond
had
never
had
a
fairer
setting
and
stately
the
old
colonial
mansion
stood
on
one
of
the
low
emerald
hills
which
roll
back
lazily
from
the
peaceful
james
it
was
true
that
the
flower
beds
had
been
trampled
down
to
ruin
by
alien
horse
and
heel
but
the
scent
of
the
honeysuckle
clinging
to
those
shining
pillars
only
seemed
the
sweeter
for
the
loss
and
whatever
else
the
forager
might
take
he
could
not
rob
them
of
their
gracious
vista
of
hills
and
shimmering
river
across
the
broad
driveway
and
up
the
steps
of
the
veranda
passed
cary
fairer
than
had
been
the
flowers
a
true
daughter
of
the
oldtime
south
gentle
and
quiet
eyed
her
light
summer
dress
of
the
cheapest
material
yet
deftly
fashioned
by
her
own
fingers
from
slightly
opened
neck
where
an
old
brooch
lay
against
her
soft
throat
down
to
the
dainty
spotless
flounces
lying
above
her
petticoat
of
crinoline
though
her
lips
and
eyes
refused
to
betray
it
even
when
there
was
no
one
to
see
it
was
with
a
very
heavy
heart
that
she
mounted
the
stairs
to
the
attic
thinking
contriving
clutching
desperately
at
her
fading
hopes
for
good
reason
the
plantation
was
very
silent
on
this
warm
spring
morning
where
only
a
year
before
dozens
of
soft
eyed
jerseys
had
ranged
through
the
pastures
and
wood
lots
there
was
now
no
sound
of
tinkling
bells
one
after
another
the
fine
blooded
stock
had
been
requisitioned
by
a
sad
faced
quartermaster
of
the
army
of
northern
virginia
and
one
by
one
the
fat
porkers
who
had
muzzled
greedily
among
the
ears
from
the
cary
bins
and
who
ought
to
have
gone
into
the
smoke
house
had
departed
squealing
to
furnish
bone
and
sinew
with
which
to
repel
the
invader
saddest
of
all
the
chicken
coops
down
by
the
deserted
negro
quarters
were
quite
as
empty
as
the
once
teeming
cabins
themselves
poverty
grim
and
relentless
had
caught
the
carys
in
its
iron
hand
and
behind
poverty
stood
its
far
more
frightening
shadow
starvation
but
in
these
gloomy
thoughts
she
was
not
entirely
alone
all
that
troubled
her
and
more
though
perhaps
in
a
different
way
passed
hourly
through
the
old
gray
kinky
head
of
uncle
billy
who
happened
at
this
very
moment
to
be
emerging
stealthily
from
the
woods
below
the
house
slowly
and
deliberately
he
made
his
way
toward
the
front
till
he
reached
a
bench
where
he
sat
down
under
a
tree
to
ruminate
over
the
situation
and
inspect
the
feathered
prize
which
he
had
lately
acquired
by
certain
devious
means
known
only
to
uncle
billy
wiping
his
forehead
with
his
ragged
sleeve
and
holding
the
bird
up
by
its
tied
feet
he
regarded
it
with
the
eye
of
an
expert
and
the
fatigue
of
one
who
has
been
sorely
put
to
it
in
order
to
accomplish
his
purpose
it
to
me
said
uncle
billy
dat
des
when
you
needs
the
mostest
the
chickens
goes
to
roosting
higher
higher
rooster
i
wonder
who

he
murmured
as
he
thoughtfully
sounded
the
rooster
well
developed
chest
through
the
feathers
from
de
feelin
of
you
my
son
i
you
was
raise
by
one
er
de
what
is
but
uncle
billy
knew
the
fortunes
of
the
cary
family
far
too
well
to
mourn
over
the
probable
toughness
of
his
booty
and
as
he
rose
up
from
the
seat
and
meandered
toward
the
kitchen
his
old
wrinkled
face
broke
into
a
broad
smile
of
satisfaction
over
the
surprise
he
had
in
store
well
after
i
done
parbile
you
i
reckon
miss
hallie
be
mighty
glad
to
see
you
yas
but
as
uncle
billy
walked
slowly
along
beside
the
hedge
which
shielded
the
house
on
one
side
he
heard
a
sound
which
made
him
halt
a
young
negro
coming
from
the
rear
had
dodged
behind
the
hedge
and
was
trying
to
keep
out
of
his
sight
hi
dar
you
jeems
henry
shouted
uncle
billy
instantly
suspicious
of
such
maneuvers
come
heh

at
this
sudden
command
a
young
mulatto
hesitating
came
through
a
break
in
the
hedge
and
stood
looking
at
him
sullen
and
silent
in
his
hands
he
carried
a
small
bundle
done
up
in
a
colored
handkerchief
and
on
this
guilty
piece
of
baggage
uncle
billy
eye
immediately
fastened
with
an
angry
frown
whar

demanded
uncle
billy
with
an
accusing
finger
trembling
at
the
bundle
the
younger
man
made

of
severity

and
loathing

he
said
and
a
rigid
arm
pointed
back
at
the
house
which

been
for

source
of
shelter
and
comfort

backed
away
go
long
wid

and
git
yo
freedom
an
a
blackin
brush
so
engrossed
were
both
the
actors
in
this
drama
that
they
failed
to
hear
the
sound
of
footsteps
on
the
veranda
and
it
was
so
that
the
mistress
of
the
manor
found
the
runaway
and
the
old
slave
glaring
into
each
other
eyes
and
insulting
one
another
volubly
cary
with
her
workbasket
on
her
arm
paused
at
the
top
of
the
steps
and
regarded
the
angry
pair
with
surprise
why
uncle
billy
she
queried
what
is
going
on
here
what
the
matter
it
jeems
henry
dat
what
de
matter
said
uncle
billy
in
defense
of
his
agitation
he
runnin
to
de
yankees
cary
stopped
short
for
a
moment
and
then
came
slowly
down
the
steps
oh
james
she
said
unbelievingly
is
this
really
true
jeems
henry
hung
his
head
and
dug
at
the
gravel
with
his
toe
i
sorry
said
cary
and
the
word
held
a
world
of
painful
thought
of
of
hopeless
regret
of
sorrow
for
one
who
could
be
so
foolishly
misguided
i
sorry
not
only
for
ourselves
but
for
you
know
i
promised
mammy
before
she
died
that
i
would
look
after
you
always
still
jeems
henry
made
no
answer
and
old
uncle
billy
saw
fit
to
make
a
disclosure
he
gwine
up
to
chickahominy
then
to
jeems
henry
he
added
something
in
low
tones
which
made
the
young
negro
eyes
roll
wildly
with
fear
dey
tells
me
dat
der
and
over
dar
i
hopes

you

you

very
well
uncle
billy
there

no
such
things
as
ghosts
nor
i
do
miss
hallie
responded
uncle
billy
sticking
tenaciously
to
his
point
because
he
could
plainly
see
jeems
henry
wavering
was
jes
las
night
i

one
moanin
de

house
an
ef
i
ai
mighty
fur
wrong
she
was
smellin
arfter
jeems
henry
at
this
wild
fabrication
the
reason
for
which
she
nevertheless
appreciated
cary
had
hard
work
to
hold
back
a
smile
although
she
promptly
reassured
the
terrified
jeems
henry
there
now
there
that
will
do
nothing
of
that
kind
will
trouble
you
james
you
may
take
my
word
for

if

try
to
keep
you
but
what
have

that
bundle
hi
hi

way

interrupted
uncle
billy
excitedly
foreseeing
means
to
prevent
jeems
henry
departure
what
you
got
in
yo
bundle
jeems
henry
lifted
his
anguished
eyes
and
gazed
truthfully
at
his
mistress
i
ai
got
nothin
what
do
to
me
miss
hallie
i
do
mean
that
cary
responded
kindly
but
you
have
a
long
tramp
before
you
have
you
anything
to
eat
nor
i
ai
and
jeems
henry
seemed
disturbed
then
you
better
come
around
to
the
kitchen
we
see
what
we
can
find
at
this
generosity
uncle
billy
eyes
opened
widely
and
he
exploded
in
remonstrance
now
hol
on
dar
miss
hallie
hol
on
you
ain
got
none
too
much
stuffin
dis
yere
rat
hole
wid
waffles
milasses
commanded
his
mistress
yas
was
the
meek
response
and
uncle
billy
subsided
into
silence
with
a
sigh
cary
turned
away
toward
the
house
well
james
are
you
coming
but
jeems
henry
completely
abashed
before
this
miracle
of
kindness
which
he
did
not
deserve
decided
that
it
was
time
for
him
to
be
a
man
thank
you
miss
hallie
he
gulped
but
now
on
i
reckon
i
gwine
take
keer
of
cary
pausing
on
the
bottom
step
raised
her
eyes
heavenward
in
a
short
prayer
that
children
such
as
these
might
somehow
be
protected
from
themselves
well
james
she
said
when
she
saw
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
done
i
hope
you
be
happy
and
contented
if
you
are
not
come
back
to
us
perhaps
when
the
war
is
over
you
find
things
a
little
more
comfortable
james
and
she
held
out
her
hand
but
this
last
touch
of
gentleness
was
too
much
for
the
young
mulatto
although
he
made
an
obedient
step
forward
his
feelings
overcame
him
and
with
an
audible
snuffle
and
his
hand
over
his
eyes
he
retreated
then
turned
his
back
and
plunged
through
the
hedge
cary
sank
down
on
the
step
and
looked
as
if
she
too
would
like
to
cry
manfully
uncle
billy
came
to
her
rescue
now
do
you
care
miss
hallie
he
wan
no
for
plowin
no
how
oh
it
is
that
uncle
billy
cary
replied
with
a
low
cry
of
regret
it
is
the
actual
loss
of
help
tho
we
need
it
goodness
knows
but
it
makes
me
sad
to
see
them
leaving
one
by
one
they
are
such
children
and
so
helpless
without
a
master
hand
yas
agreed
uncle
billy
readily

have
a
stick
in

announced
proudly

runned
away
to
de
yet
no

cried
with
laughing
relief
and
her
hand
rested
on
his
shoulder
in
a
gentle
caress
i
as
soon

of
the
skies
falling
it
is
just
such
faithful
friends
as

uncle
billy
promptly
not
quite
understanding
i

a
woman

uncle
billy
the
battles
that
we
fight
alone
gary
rose
to
her
feet
and

dear
uncle
billy
repeated
gary
while
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
the
most
truthful
the
most
cary
stopped
and
looked
sharply
at
something
lying
on
the
ground
beside
the
steps
then
she
turned
and
swept
the
old
man
with
an
accusing
glance
which
made
him
quail
she
said
in
awful
tones
yas
replied
uncle
billy
feverishly
what
uncle
billy
immediately
became
the
very
picture
of
innocence
and
ignorance
he
looked
everywhere
but
at
the
helpless
rooster

he
asked
aw
dat

down
from

would
not
recognize
it
if
it
were
hers
whose
is
he
she
asked

fencing
for

in

william
commanded

severely

a
situation

rooster
and
made
an
attempt
to
escape
down
on
de
low
grouns
dis

said

completely
unconvinced

to
hide

laughter

repeated
uncle
billy
while
his
ancient
mind
worked
with
unusual
rapidity

and
with
a
final
chuckle
of
joy
over
his
success
the
old
man
hobbled
quickly
away
in
the
direction
of
the
kitchen
cary
still
smiling
went
back
to
play
fatima
to
a
dusky
blue
beard
oh

and
virgie
dancing

to

the
ground

the
meek
response
sally
ann
blue
beard
pointed
to
an
imaginary
door
halfway
between
them
and
where
virgie
sat
on
the
steps

with
delight

and
then
in
a
whisper
as
blue
beard
stalked
away
to
hide
behind
a
tree
what
we
do
now
now

come
in
cried
virgie
i
anne
that
looks
for
the
horseman
in
the
cloud
of
dust
and
jumping
up
the
child
managed
to
change
the
tones
of
her
voice
in
a
surprising
manner
good

gone
away
and
now
we
can
look
in
his
secret
room

full
of
fear
from

imaginary

cried
virgie
with
a
little
squeal
of
disappointment
you
to
it
part
of
the
play
and
she
led
her
up
to
the
invisible
door
now
look
in
and
when
you
look
drop
the
keys
an
we
both
scream
slowly
the
door
seemed
to
open
and
after
an
instant
terrified
silence
both
actresses
screamed
with
complete
success
whereupon
fatima
dropped
to
her
knees
and
sister
anne
hugged
her
tight
it
blood
it
the
blood
of
his
seven
wives
a
great
roar
sounded
in
their
ears
mercy
what
that
cried
the
terrified
fatima
it
blue
beard
he
coming
back
whereupon
virgie
immediately
left
fatima
to
face
her
fate
alone
having
spent
a
night
and
a
day
behind
the
tree
blue
beard
now
rushed
upon
the
castle
and
roared
for
his
wife
greeting
my
lord
said
the
trembling
fatima
with
a
low
curtsey

old

with
a
bridle
in

hand
and
a
carriage
whip
in
the
other
came
slowly
upon
the
scene
at
the
sight
of
sally
ann
apparently
about
to
assault
his
mistress
the
bridle
dropped
from
his
hand
and
with
a
tight
clutch
on
the
carriage
whip
he
covered
the
intervening
space
at
an
amazing
speed

of
the
hedge
at
a
swift
trot
came
a
man
in
the
uniform
of
an
officer
in
the
confederate
army
and

in

arms

one
look
and
threw
out
her
arms

the
man
on

let
virgie
slide
down
and
then
dismounted
like
a
flash
coming
to
her
across
the
little
space
of
lawn
with
his
whole
soul
in
his
eyes
with
his
dear
wife
caught
in
his
arms

could
do
nothing

her
and

her
as
if
he
would
never
again
let
her
go
hallie
he
breathed
but
it
good
to

they
stood
for
a
long
moment
husband
and
wife
united
after
months
of
separation
after
dangers
and
terrors
and
privations
which
had
seemed
as
if
they
never
would
end
sally
ann
was
one
of
the
first
to
interrupt

out
of

clank
sally

before
the
cloud
of
fine
white
dust
that
rose
under
uncle

vigorous
hands
you
choking

mistress
to
death

dust

minutes
cary
clasped
her
hands
together
at
her
breast
with
a
look
of
entreaty
herbert
must
you
go
so
soon
her
husband
looked
back
at
her
with
eyes
dark
with
regret
yes
he
said
briefly
i
on
my
way
to
richmond
how
many
horses
are
there
in
the
stable
two
only
two
was
the
broken
response
as
his
wife
sank
down
disconsolate
on
a
bench
belle
and
lightfoot
we
sold
the
others
i
to
do
it

in
the
cedars
then

here
and
give

some
water
and
a
measure
of
corn
look
sharp
billy
lively
in
the
face
of
danger
to
his
master
uncle
billy
response
was
instant
yes
seh
right
away
seh
and
he
took
cary
lathered
animal
and
made
off
for
the
stables
at
top
speed
cary
looked
up
at
her
husband
with
a
great
fear
written
on
her
face
why
herbert
dear
you
you
do
mean
to
say
that
the
yankees
are
in
the
neighborhood
immediately
cary
was
on
the
bench
beside
her
with
his
arm
around
her
while
virgie
climbed
up
on
the
other
side
now
come
he
murmured
be
a
brave
little
woman
and
do
be
alarmed
it
may
be
nothing
after
all
only
there
are
several
foraging
parties
small
ones
a
few
miles
down
the
river
i
been
dodging
them
all
morning
if
they
come
at
all
they
wo
trouble
either
you
or
virgie
but
not
afraid
of
them
cried
the
small
daughter
and
she
doubled
up
her
fist
ferociously
look
at
aha
there
a
brave
little
rebel
her
father
cried
as
he
swept
her
up
in
a
hearty
hug
not
afraid
of
them
nor
you
either
god
bless
you
and
his
lips
rested
for
a
moment
on
his
wife
soft
cheek
only
you
are
apt
to
be
a
little
too
haughty
if
they
search
the
house
for
arms
or
stragglers
make
no
resistance
it
best
yes
yes
i
know
his
wife
cried
out
but
you
dear
why
are
you
here
why
are
you
with
your
company
cary
looked
away
for
a
moment
across
the
fields
and
down
the
slope
towards
the
shimmering
river
they
were
very
beautiful
he
wondered
why
he
had
not
fully
realized
all
that
wife
and
child
and
home
meant
to
him
when
he
volunteered
recently
for
a
certain
hazardous
duty
he
knew
too
how
quickly
his
dear
wife
would
know
the
full
extent
of
the
peril
with
which
he
felt
himself
surrounded
and
so
his
reply
was
short
and
seemingly
gruff
as
many
another
man
has
been
under
too
heavy
circumstances
scouting
duty
i
been
on
it
for
the
past
two
months
cary
hand
went
to
her
heart
a
herbert
but
darling
why
it
so
dangerous
so
horrible
so
he
put
up
his
hand
with
a
forced
smile
to
check
her
and
broke
in
gayly
ah
but
think
of
the
fun
in
it
it
like
playing
with
virgie
but
his
wife
was
not
to
be
put
off
so
lightly
and
she
put
her
impelling
hands
on
his
arm
gary
changed
his
tone
his
voice
deepened
they
need
me
dear
he
said
earnestly
what
does
danger
to
one
man
mean
when
dixie
calls
us
all
and
i
doing
work
good
work
already
given
one
battle
to
general
lee
and
now
i
have
information
that
will
give
him
another
and
a
bigger
one
two
nights
ago
i
came
through
the
union
lines
i
cary
rose
unsteadily
to
her
feet
through
the
yankee
lines
oh
herbert
as
a
spy
a
spy
of
course
not
i
hid
in
the
woods
all
day
then
climbed
a
tall
pine
tree
and
got
the
lay
of
their
camp
the
number
of
their
guns
the
disposition
of
forces
and
their
lines
of
attack
yesterday
i
had
the
wires
at
drury
bluff
and
started
trouble
i
on
my
way
now
to
join
my
command
but
i
had
a
good
excuse
for
coming
home
to
hold
you
in
in
my
arms
again
if
only
for
a
moment
you
see
poor
old
roger
got
a
wound
in
his
flank
from
a
stray
bullet
a
bullet
asked
gary
doubtfully
yes
he
smiled
for
he
had
escaped
it
a
stray
bullet
meant
for
but
daddy
virgie
interrupted
while
you
were
up
in
the
tree
a
wild
whoop
broke
off
virgie
question

ann
was
rushing
down
the
steps
her
eyes
rolling
up
with
excitement

with
naïve
truthfulness
ol
simmons
he
drivin
by

in
de
buggy
cary
threw
up
her
hands

a
muffled
cry

relief
and
laughter

before

gently
imprisoned
her
face
in
his
hands

said
his
eyes
grown
sad
again
just
fix
me
up
something

can
find
i
munch
it
in
the
saddle
for
a
moment
their
lips
clung
and
then
she
stepped
back
with
a
broken
sigh
i
do
the
best
i
can
but
oh
how
i
wish
it
all
were

that

had

spasm

the
man

wife

him
a
startled
look

a
single
hope
even
the
tiniest
ray
cary
took
her
hands
in
his
looked
into
her
eyes
and
his
answer
breathed
the
still
unconquered
spirit
of
the
south
there
is
always
hope
as
long
as
we
have
a
man
cary
went
into
the
house
slowly
wearily
and
cary
turned
to
virgie
well
little
lady
her
father
said
resting
his
hand
on
shining
head

taking
good
care
of

general

one
day
when

was
feedin
him
with
milk
he
nearly
swallowed
my
silver
spoon
laughed
the
amused
soldier
and
swept
her
up
in
his
arms
if
we
could
only
get
rid
of
all
their
generals
as
easy
as
that
we
promise
not
to

for
a

virgie
dolefully

runned
away
this
morning
the
deuce
he
did
the
young
scamp
he
gone
to
join
the
yankees
virgie
continued
what
that
and
cary
sprang
up
to
pace
to
and
fro
i
wonder
which
way
he
went
i
don
know
whimpered
virgie
forlornly
i
only
wish
i
was
a
soldier
with
a
big
sharp
sword
like
yours
when
the
blue
boys
came
in
the
stomach
cary
was
coming
down
the
steps
now
with
a
small
package
of
food
and
in
the
roadway
uncle
billy
stood
feeding
and
watering
his
horse
in
this
bitterest
of
moments
when
his
own
family
had
to
be
the
ones
to
hurry
him
along
his
way
there
had
come
another
and
greater
danger
peril
to
those
he
loved
tell
me
dear
he
said
with
his
hand
warm
on
his
wife
soft
shoulder
is
it
true
that
jeems
henry
ran
away
this
morning
yes
she
nodded
i
knew
the
poor
boy
meant
to
leave
us
sooner
or
later
so
i
made
no
effort
to
detain
him
you
did
right
was
the
answer
but
which
way
did
he
go
up
the
river
to
a
union
camp
on
the
chickahominy
chickahominy
exclaimed
cary
sharply
and
bit
his
lips
so
that
the
lay
of
the
land
eh
i
mighty
glad
you
told
me
this
but
still
cary
voice
faded
away
under
the
weight
of
a
sudden
despair
what
was
the
use
of
fighting
forever
against
such
fearful
odds
what
could
they
ever
gain
save
a
little
more
honor
and
at
what
dreadful
cost
what
makes
you
look
so
worried
herbert
his
wife
murmured
her
nerves
on
edge
again
yes
it
true
the
man
said
with
a
groan
they
gradually
closing
in
on
us
surrounding
richmond
us
cary
whispered
hardly
believing
her
ears
yes
it
true
all
too
true
the
man
burst
out
bitterly
we
can
fight
against
thousands
and
against
tens
of
thousands
but
darling
we
ca
fight
half
the
world
he
sank
down
on
the
bench
one
elbow
on
his
crossed
knee
the
other
arm
hanging
listlessly
by
his
side
his
face
grew
lined
and
haggard
all
the
spirit
the
indomitable
courage
of
a
moment
ago
had
fled
before
the
revelation
that
try
as
they
might
they
could
never
conquer
in
this
terribly
unequal
fight
then
he
threw
out
his
hand
and
began
to
speak
half
to
her
and
half
to
the
unseen
armies
of
his
fellows
our
armies
are
exhausted
dwindling
day
by
day
we
are
drawing
from
the
cradle
and
the
grave
old
men
who
can
scarcely
bear
the
weight
of
a
musket
on
their
shoulders
and
boys
mere
children
who
are
sacrificed
under
the
wheels
the
best
the
flower
of
our
land
we
are
dumping
them
all
into
a
big
red
hopper
feed
feed
always
more
feed
for
this
greedy
machine
of
war
silently
wife
and
daughter
came
to
the
man
in
his
despair
as
if
to
ward
off
some
dark
shape
which
hovered
over
him
with
brushing
wings
their
arms
went
around
him
together
there
there
dear
he
heard
a
soft
voice
whisper
do
grow
despondent
even
though
you
fought
a
losing
fight
it
has
been
a
glorious
one
and
god
will
not
forget
the
stars
and
bars
remember
you
still
have
us
who
love
you
to
the
end
and
fight
your
battles
on
our
knees
slowly
the
man
looked
up
forgive
me
honey
he
murmured
remorsefully
you
are
right
and
bravest
after
all
it
is
you
you
women
who
save
us
in
the
darkest
hours
you
our
wives
our
mothers
who
wage
a
silent
battle
in
the
lonely
broken
homes
you
give
us
love
and
pity
tenderness
and
tears
a
flag
of
pride
that
turns
defeat
to
victory
the
women
of
the
south
he
cried
and
herbert
cary
doffed
his
hat
before
his
wife
the
crutch
on
which
the
staggering
hope
of
dixie
leans
there
came
then
the
sound
of
hurrying
footsteps
once
more
sally
ann
rushed
from
the
house
but
this
time
genuine
danger
was
written
plainly
in
her
face
mars
cary
mars
cary
dey
comin
dis
time
sho
how
many
cary
cried
springing
for
the
roadway
and

the
edge
of
the
woods

once
in
the
saddle
he
stooped
and
kissed
her
then
caught
up
virgie
for
a
last
hug
burying
his
worn
face
in
her
curls
little
one
take
good
care
of
mother
with
one
last
grasp
his
wife
caught
his
hand
herbert
which
way
do
you
go
across
the
river
to
the
chesterfield
side
but
the
yankees
came
that
way
too
i
circle
around
them
if
they
left
a
guard
at
the
crossing
swim
the
river
higher
up
he
slapped
his
holster
with
his
open
hand
listen
for
three
shots
if
they
come
in
quick
succession
then
crossed
i
safe
if
i
only
had
a
few
men
i
stay
but
alone
i
ca
you
know
i
ca
god
bless
you
and
in
another
moment
he
was
in
the
saddle
had
waved
his
hand
was
gone
straining
their
eyes
after
him
as
if
they
would
somehow
pierce
the
dark
woods
which
hid
his
flight
mother
and
daughter
stood
as
if
turned
to
stone
only
virgie
after
a
moment
waved
her
hand
and
sent
her
soft
childish
prayer
winging
after
him
to
save
him
from
all
harm
sally
ann
however
having
seen
the
approaching
danger
with
her
own
eyes
began
to
wring
her
hands
and
cry
hysterically
aw
miss
hallie
i
so
skeered
i
so
skeered
sally
cried
cary
as
the
sound
of
hoofbeats
thudding
through
the
woods
came
unmistakably
to
her
ears
take
virgie
with
you
instantly
and
run
down
through
the
grove
to
the
old
ice
house
hide
there
under
the
pine
tags
understand
but
the
negro
girl
ashen
with
terror
seemed
incapable
of
flight
i
skeered
to
go
miss

she
whimpered
i
wan
stay
here
wid
you
but
you
ca
i
tell

her
mistress
answered
as
the
certainty
of
the
girl
helplessness
before
a
questioner
flashed
through
her
mind
you
tell
everything
oh
come
on
you
big
baby
virgie
urged
pulling
at
sally
sleeve
take
care
of
you
then
her
eye
fell
on
susan
jemima
lying
neglected
on
the
bench
and
she
gave
a
faint
scream
at
her
heartlessness
goodness
gracious
mother
she
cried
as
still
holding
on
to
sally
ann
she
ran
and
caught
up
her
beloved
doll

the
clank
of

sound
of

commands

in
her
ears

although
such
action
was
farthest
from
his
thoughts
in
des
a
minnit
i
be
dar
in

but
once
his
mistress
had
closed
the
door
behind
her
uncle
billy
plan
of
operations
changed
hurrying
down
the
steps
he
plunged
his
arm
under
the
porch
and
drew
forth
a
rusty
ax
with
his
weapon
over
his
shoulder
he
hastened
up
on
the
veranda
and
stood
with
his
back
against
the
door
chapter
iii
the
thudding
feet
came
nearer
a
bugle
call
a
rattling
of
accouterments
and
then
from
the
other
side
of
the
hedge
came
a
half
dozen
troopers
in
blue
led
by
a
sergeant
with
a
red
face
and
bloodshot
eyes
this
way
boys
the
sergeant
shouted
and
at
the
sound
of
a
harsh
voice
uncle
billy
grasp
on
his
ax
grew
tighter
know
the
place
i

here
before

the
liquor
and

while
the
colonel
is
stealing
the
horses
eh
then
his
eyes
fell
on
uncle
billy
and
he
greeted
him
with
a
yell
of
recognition
hello

black
old
ape

and
show

where
you
buried
the
silver
and
the
whisky

and
he
lurched
forward

rusty
ax
high
in
the
air

an
ef

anudder
one
furious
at
the
recollection
of
his
shame
of
a
few
years
back
when
he
had
been
overseer
on
this
same
plantation
the
sergeant
rushed
up
the
steps
and
knocked
the
ax
aside
with
his
gun
barrel
yes
he
did
whip
me
burn
him
and
now
i
do
the
same
for
you
seizing
uncle
billy
by
the
throat
he
pushed
him
against
the
house
instantly
the
door
swung
open
cary
her
head
held
high
her
beautiful
dark
eyes
blazing
with
wrath
stood
on
the
threshold
stop
it
she
commanded
in
tones
that
brooked
no
disobedience
even
from
a
drunkard
let
my
servant
go
instantly
astounded
at
this
sudden
apparition
the
man
shrank
back
for
a
moment
but
almost
as
quickly
regained
his
bluster
the
beautiful
cary
eh
i
glad
to
see
you
looking
so
well
and
handsome
the
words
might
as
well
have
been
spoken
to
the
wind
for
all
the
notice
that
the
woman
paid
them
with
only
a
gesture
of
mingled
contempt
and
loathing
she
stepped
to
the
railing
and
called
to
the
grinning
troopers
below
who
is
in
command
here
to
her
horror
only
dudley
answered
am
he
said
triumphantly
he
thrust
a
menacing
face
close
to
hers
and
ordered
her
curtly
and
i
just
as
soon
have
get
me
a
drink
as
the
nigger
come
on
fine
lady
intent
on
insulting
this
woman
whose
husband
had
once
cut
his
back
with
a
whip
the
man
caught
her
by
the
arm
and
roughly
tried
to
pull
her
to
him
but
before
he
could
accomplish
his
purpose
retribution
fell
on
him
with
a
heavy
hand
through
a
gap
in
the
hedge
an
officer
at
the
head
of
a
dozen
troopers
appeared
one
look
at
the
scene
on
the
veranda
and
morrison
with
a
smothered
cry
dashed
up
the
steps
you
beastly
coward
and
catching
the
drunkard
by
the
collar
he
twisted
him
around
and
hurled
him
thudding
and
bumping
down
the
steps
dudley
i
ought
to
have
you
shot
he
swept
his
arm
out
and
gave
voice
to
a
ringing
command
report
to
lieutenant
harris
at
once
arrest
corporal
take
his
gun
he
paused
a
moment
as
a
brother
of
the
man
now
under
arrest
stepped
forward
with
a
sullen
face
and
obeyed
orders
running
his
glance
over
the
line
of
faces
now
suddenly
vacant
of
expression
he
whipped
them
mercilessly
with
his
eye
you
men
too
will
hear
from
me
go
to
the
stable
and
wait
another
piece
of
work
like
this
and
i
have
your
coats
cut
off
with
a
belt
buckle
clear
out
then
he
turned
to
the
beautiful
woman
in
white
who
stood
only
a
few
feet
away
no
longer
timid
but
in
entire
possession
of
her
faculties
before
what
she
knew
might
prove
a
greater
danger
than
a
drunkard
madam
said
the
union
officer
as
he
doffed
his
hat
i
apologize
for
this
no
matter
how
hard
i
tried
but
believe
me
i
regret
it
deeply
in
answer
she
slowly
raised
her
heavy
lidded
eyes
and
gave
him
her
first
thrust
smoothly
and
deftly
no
apology
is
demanded
she
murmured
in
soft
tones
i
was
merely
unfamiliar
with
the
union
method
of
attack
attack
he
repeated
astounded
and
stepped
back
what
else
she
asked
simply
my
home
is
my
servant
assaulted
by
a
drunken
ruffian
the
man
will
be
punished
was
the
stern
reply
to
the
limit
of
my
authority
he
be
we
know
him
the
southern
woman
said
bitterly
before
the
war
he
was
our
overseer
he
was
cruel
to
the
negroes
and
my
husband
gave
him
a
taste
of
his
own
discipline
with
a
riding
whip
ah
i
see
morrison
nodded
but
it
is
not
always
in
an
power
to
control
each
individual
in
the
service
especially
at
such
a
time
yet
i
assure
you
on
the
part
of
the
union
and
mine
that
there
was
no
intention
of
attack
cary
had
chosen
this
moment
in
which
to
draw
her
visitor
off
the
veranda
and
when
she
had
successfully
brought
him
to
the
foot
of
the
steps
she
looked
up
in
smiling
sarcasm
with
another
thrust
oh
then
since
your
visit
would
seem
a
one
how
may
i
serve
you
sir
morrison
laughed
lightly
this
pretty
cat
could
scratch
i
afraid
dear
madam
you
are
wrong
again
my
detachment
is
on
foraging
duty
it
is
not
a
pleasant
task
but
our
army
is
in
need
of
horses
and
supplies
and
by
the
rules
of
war
i
must
take
what
i
can
find
even
by
force
came
the
quiet
inquiry
yes
even
force
he
answered
reddening
with
its
proper
limitations
i
rob
you
it
is
true
but
by
virtue
of
necessity
in
return
i
can
only
offer
as
i
would
to
every
other
woman
of
the
south
all
courtesy
and
protection
at
my
command
and
morrison
for
the
second
time
took
off
his
hat
the
southern
woman
swept
him
a
curtsey
filled
with
graceful
mockery
i
thank
you
there
is
consolation
and
even
flattery
in
being
plundered
by
a
gentleman
she
made
a
short
gesture
which
took
in
house
plantation
and
all
the
cary
possessions
i
regret
sincerely
that
we
have
nothing
left
yet
i
beg
you
help
yourself
colonel
morrison
bit
his
lip
half
in
vexation
and
half
in
amusement
at
least
you
make
my
undertaking
a
difficult
one
although
i
must
admit
i
hardly
blame
you
and
then
with
a
quick
searching
look
are
there
any
rebels
hidden
in
your
house
no
she
answered
no
wounded
officers
or
refugees
of
any
kind
none
you
give
me
your
word
for
this
your
oath
the
southern
woman
head
went
up
and
her
eyes
flashed
i
do
she
said
contemptuously
and
moved
away
thank
you
was
the
grave
reply
and
he
turned
to
dismiss
his
men
then
a
thought
struck
him
and
he
detained
her
with
a
gesture
pardon
me
but
if
it
true
if
a
brother
or
a
father
was
concealed
in
there
would
your
answer
be
the
same
the
answer
that
came
proudly
back
did
not
amaze
him
i
would
try
to
protect
them
yes
even
with
a
ah
he
said
sharply
then
do
you
you
see
you
tie
the
hands
of
courtesy
and
me
to
to
this
invasion
of
your
home
make
a
search
of
the
house
for
hidden
arms
or
stragglers
and
report
to
me
if
any
rebels
are
found
bring
them
out
wait
he
ordered
as
the
corporal
promptly
started
forward
nothing
else
must
be
taken
or
molested
one
moment
commanded
cary
in
her
turn
and
beckoned
to
uncle
billy
who
had
been
standing
by
in
silence
william
conduct
these
soldiers
through
my
house
and
show
them
every
courtesy
if
the
colonel
orders
are
not
obeyed
report
to
me
yas
grinned
uncle
billy
with
an
opera
bouffe
salute
molestashun
gwine
report
morrison
laughed
outright
i
sorry
you
still
have
doubts
of
my
honorable
intentions
may
may
my
soldiers
go
in
now
thank
you
he
walked
away
a
few
steps
then
turned
and
looked
at
her
where
she
sat
on
the
bench
demurely
sewing
it
occurred
to
him
that
she
was
demure
besides
he
had
discovered
something
er
it
is
true
that
i
found
your
stable
empty
he
said
while
his
eyes
probed
hers
but
curiously
enough
it
seems
to
have
been
recently
occupied
yes
was
the
reply
yes
he
echoed
with
a
touch
of
iron
in
his
voice
and
you
can
insure
our
leaving
you
more
quickly
if
you
will
tell
me
where
these
horses
have
been
hidden
cary
did
not
raise
her
eyes
granted
that
we
them
she
said
i
afraid
i
must
trouble
you
to
look
for
them
otherwise
there
would
be
no
sense
in
trying
to
protect
my
property
right
again
he
acknowledged
but
did
not
swerve
from
what
he
had
to
do
orderly
he
commanded
report
to
lieutenant
harris
at
the
stables
and
have
him
hunt
the
woods
and
swamp
for
hidden
horses
hurry
we
must
leave
in
half
an
hour
as
morrison
spoke
his
eye
fell
on
the
roadway
and
he
started
perceptibly
when
he
turned
back
to
the
woman
on
the
bench
it
was
with
a
sterner
light
in
his
eye
i
also
notice
that
a
horse
has
recently
been
fed
and
watered
in
your
carriage
road
was
he
again
that
smooth
soft
voice
with
its
languid
evasions
we
have
several
neighbors
colonel
they
visit
us
at
infrequent
times
undoubtedly
he
conceded
but
do
you
usually
feed
their
horses
she
smiled
faintly
what
little
hospitality
is
ours
extends
to
both
man
and
beast
i
can
well
believe
it
he
replied
for
he
saw
to
this
quick
witted
woman
would
be
forever
useless
and
in
happier
times
i
could
wish
it
might
extend
to
me
oh
i
mean
no
offense
he
interrupted
as
cary
rose
haughtily
i
only
want
you
to
believe
that
i
sorry
for
this
intrusion
she
raised
her
eyebrows
faintly
and
sat
down
again
and
was
that
the
reason
why
you
asked
about
my
neighbor
horse
no
he
said
quickly
and
as
suddenly
caught
and
held
her
eye
a
rebel
scout
who
has
been
giving
us
trouble
a
handsome
fellow
riding
a
bay
horse
i
thought
perhaps
he
might
have
passed
this
way
if
he
had
thought
he
would
detect
anything
in
her
face
he
was
once
more
mistaken
it
is
more
than
possible
cary
remarked
with
a
touch
of
weariness
the
road
out
there
is
a
public
one
and
where
does
it
lead
to
may
i
ask
that
depends
upon
which
way
you
are
traveling
and
which
fork
you
take
possibly
but
suppose
you
were
riding
north
would
the
right
fork
lead
to
richmond
and
the
left
swing
around
toward
the
river
crossing
as
to
that
i
must
refer
you
to
a
more
competent
authority
she
answered
with
a
hint
of
some
disclosure
in
her
tones
who
jefferson
davis
she
replied
and
almost
laughed
outright
as
he
turned
away
to
hide
his
vexation
this
was
an
easy
game
for
her
to
play
and
every
moment
she
gained
added
to
herbert
safety
but
if
only
she
could
hear
those
three
shots
from
across
the
river
well
harris
said
morrison
as
his
lieutenant
strode
up
i
have
to
report
sir
that
we
gotten
what
little
hay
and
corn
there
was
in
the
stables
and
are
waiting
for
your
orders
very
well
and
morrison
incisive
words
rang
mercilessly
in
the
listening
woman
ears
pick
out
the
best
shots
you
have
among
your
men
and
send
them
at
the
gallop
down
this
road
to
the
river
crossing
string
them
along
the
bank
dismount
them
and
have
them
watch
as
they
never
watched
before
you
understand
now
if
ever
a
woman
hated
a
man
or
rather
the
crushing
force
he
typified
then
herbert
cary
wife
hated
this
clear
headed
efficient
northerner
who
was
now
discovering
how
he
had
been
delayed
and
thwarted
yet
she
had
plenty
of
spirit
left
for
as
corporal
dudley
and
his
file
of
troopers
emerged
from
the
house
she
stood
up
and
caught
uncle
eye
well
corporal
asked
morrison
well
william
asked
cary
it
all
right
miss
hallie
uncle
billy
grinned
dey
ai
took
nothin
not
a
single
thing
thank
you
william
said
cary
having
triumphed
again
and
thank
gentlemen
with
a
bow
to
morrison
she
went
superbly
back
to
her
seat
under
the
trees
but
as
she
went
it
took
all
her
strength
of
will
to
keep
from
crying
down
the
carriage
road
a
squad
of
cavalry
was
galloping
furiously
towards
the
river
and
still
she
had
not
heard
the
three
shots
now
then
corporal
you
found
what
nothing
sir
we
hunted
from
cellar
to
roof
no
arms
and
no
rebels
h
he
mused
anything
else
three
bedrooms
sir
all
in
use
three
colonel
morrison
exclaimed
very
well
that
all
i
join
you
in
a
moment
then
he
turned
to
cary
his
face
stern
with
resolve
madam
he
said
crisply
you
are
not
alone
on
this
plantation
with
only
this
old
negro
we
are
wasting
time
i
after
a
rebel
scout
and
want
which
way
did
he
go
i
sorry
sir
she
said
quite
ready
to
play
her
game
again
but
our
rebel
scouts
usually
neglect
to
mention
their
precise
intentions
perhaps
if
this
one
went
at
all
is
he
still
here
i
should
imagine
then
he
did
go
this
way
to
the
river
crossing
once
more
he
caught
and
held
her
eyes
and
thought
he
would
read
the
truth
in
spite
of
anything
she
might
say
but
while
he
looked
he
saw
her
strained
face
suddenly
relax
saw
the
anxiety
flee
from
her
eyes
saw
heart
and
soul
take
on
new
life
from
far
away
across
the
river
had
come
some
faint
popping
sounds
regularly
spaced
ah
he
said
in
wonder
what
is
that
it
laughed
herbert
cary
wife
like
firing
but
i
think
it
is
a
friend
of
mine
saluting
me
from
the
safe
side
of
the
river
good
evening
colonel
and
she
swept
by
him
she
could
go
find
virgie
now
just
then
came
the
sound
of
a
horse
galloping
up
the
road
came
a
trooper
white
with
dust
his
animal
flecked
with
foam
for
colonel
morrison
urgent
he
rasped
from
a
dry
throat
as
he
thudded
across
the
lawn
and
dismounted
from
headquarters
and
he
thrust
out
a
dispatch
i
ordered
to
return
with
your
detachment
snatching
the
dispatch
from
the
man
hand
morrison
ran
his
eye
over
it
then
started
visibly
orderly
report
to
harris
recall
the
men
sound
then
bring
my
horse
once
any
details
he
asked
peremptorily
of
the
courier
big
battle
the
man
answered
two
gunboats
are
reported
coming
up
the
river
and
a
wing
of
the
rebel
army
is
advancing
from
petersburg
every
available
detachment
is
ordered
in
you
are
to
reach
camp
before
morning
all
right
we
be
there
then
as
the
bugle
sounded
ride
with
us
he
said
and
strode
over
to
where
cary
stood
arrested
by
the
news
madam
i
must
make
you
a
rather
hurried
farewell
and
a
last

moment

a
cloud
of

from

through

of

there
was
the
sound
of
clumsy
boots
on
the

the

was
thrown

chapter
iv
of
all
the
memories
of
war
after
the
dear
dead
are
buried
there
is
one
that
serves
to
bring
the
struggle
back
in
all
the
intensity
of
its
horrors
to
stand
both
as
a
monument
to
those
who
bled
and
suffered
and
as
a
lonely
sentinel
mourning
for
the
peace
and
plenty
of
the
past
a
blackened
chimney
of
all
the
houses
cabins
barns
and
cribs
which
had
made
up
the
home
of
the
carys
a
few
short
months
ago
nothing
remained
but
ashes
and
black
ruin
only
one
building
had
been
left
unburned
and
this
before
the
war
had
been
the
cabin
of
an
overseer
it
had
but
two
rooms
and
a
shallow
attic
which
was
gained
by
means
of
an
iron
ladder
reaching
to
a
closely
fitting
scuttle
in
the
ceiling
the
larger
room
was
furnished
meagerly
with
a
rough
deal
table
several
common
chairs
and
a
cupboard
against
the
wall
in
the
deep
wide
glowed
a
heap
of
embers
on
which
suspended
from
an
iron
crane
a
kettle
simmered
sadly
as
if
in
grief
for
her
brother
pots
and
pans
the
plaster
on
the
walls
had
broken
away
in
patches
especially
above
the
door
where
the
sunlight
streamed
through
the
gaping
wound
from
a
cannon
shot
the
door
and
window
shutters
were
of
heavy
oak
swinging
inward
and
fastening
with
bars
yet
now
they
were
open
and
through
them
could
be
seen
a
dreary
stretch
of
river
bottom
withering
beneath
the
rays
of
a
july
sun
beyond
a
distant
fringe
of
trees
the
muddy
james
went
murmuring
down
its
muddy
banks
where
the
blue
cranes
waited
solemnly
for
the
ebbing
tide
where
the
crows
cawed
hoarsely
in
their
busy
reeling
flight
and
the
buzzards
swung
high
above
the
marshes
yet
even
in
this
waste
of
listless
desolation
came
the
echoed
boom
of
heavy
guns
far
down
the
river
where
the
rebs
and
yanks
were
pounding
one
another
lazily
from
the
woods
which
skirted
the
carriage
road
a
man
appeared
a
thin
worn
man
in
a
uniform
of
stained
and
tattered
gray
a
man
who
peered
from
right
to
left
as
a
hunted
rabbit
might
then
darted
across
the
road
and
plunged
into
the
briery
underbrush
noiselessly
he
made
his
way
to
the
now
deserted
cabin
creeping
crawling
till
he
reached
a
point
below
an
open
window
then
slowly
raised
himself
and
looked
within
virgie
he
whispered
cautiously
virgie
no
answer
came
for
a
moment
the
man
leaned
dizzily
against
the
windowsill
his
eyes
fast
closed
with
a
nameless
dread
till
he
caught
his
grip
again
and
entered
the
open
door
virgie
he
called
in
a
louder
tone
moving
swiftly
but
unsteadily
toward
the
adjoining
room
he
flung
its
door
open
sharply
almost
angrily
yet
the
name
on
his
lips
was
tender
trembling
as
he
called
virgie
virgie
in
the
loneliness
of
dread
he
once
more
leaned
for
support
against
the
wall
wondering
listening
to
the
pounding
of
his
heart
to
the
murmur
of
the
muddy
james
and
the
fall
of
a
flake
of
plaster
loosened
by
the
dull
reverberation
of
a
distant
gun
then
suddenly
his
eye
was
caught
by
the
kettle
simmering
on
the
fire
and
he
sighed
in
swift
relief
he
wiped
his
brow
with
a
ragged
sleeve
and
went
to
where
a
stood
behind
the
door
knelt
beside
it
drinking
deeply
gratefully
yet
listening
the
while
for
unwonted
sounds
and
watching
the
bend
of
the
carriage
road
his
thirst
appeased
he
hunted
vainly
through
the
table
drawer
for
balls
and
powder
for
the
empty
pistol
at
his
hip
then
instinctively
alert
to
some
rustling
sound
outside
he
crouched
toward
the
adjoining
room
slipped
in
and
softly
closed
the
door
from
the
sunlit
world
beyond
the
cabin
walls
rose
the
murmur
of
a
childish
song
and
virgie
came
pattering
in
she
had
not
changed
greatly
in
stature
in
the
past
few
months
but
there
was
a
very
noticeable
decrease
in
the
girth
of
her
little
arms
and
body
and
her
big
dark
eyes
seemed
the
larger
for
the
whiteness
of
her
face
on
her
head
she
wore
an
old
calico
bonnet
several
sizes
too
large
and
the
gingham
dress
which
scarcely
reached
to
her
bare
brown
knees
would
not
have
done
a
few
months
ago
for
even
sally
ann
in
one
hand
virgie
carried
a
small
tin
bucket
filled
with
berries
in
the
other
she
clutched
a
doll
lovingly
against
her
breast
not
the
old
susan
jemima
but
a
new
susan
jemima
on
whom
an
equal
affection
was
being
lavished
even
though
she
was
strangely
and
wonderfully
made
to
the
intimate
view
of
the
unimaginative
susan
jemima
was
formed
from
the
limb
of
a
cedar
tree
the
forking
branches
being
her
arms
and
legs
her
costume
consisting
of
a
piece
of
rag
tied
at
the
waist
with
a
bit
of
string
on
a
chair
at
the
table
virgie
set
her
doll
then
laughed
at
the
hopelessness
of
its
breakfasting
with
any
degree
of
comfort
or
of
ease
why
lord
child
your
chin
do
come
up
to
the
table
on
the
chair
she
placed
a
wooden
box
perching
the
doll
on
top
and
taking
a
seat
herself
just
opposite
she
emptied
the
blackberries
into
a
mutilated
plate
brought
from
the
cupboard
a
handful
of
toasted
acorns
on
which
she
poured
boiling
water
then
set
the
concoction
aside
to
steep
now
miss
susan
jemima
said
virgie
addressing
her
with
the
hospitable
courtesy
due
to
so
great
a
lady
we
are
goin
to
have
some
breakfas
she
paused
in
a
shade
of
doubt
then
smiled
a
faint
apology
it
is
very
of
a
breakfas
darlin
but
we
make
believe
it
waffles
an
chicken
an
an
hot
rolls
an
an
an
everything
she
rose
to
her
little
bare
feet
holding
her
wisp
of
a
skirt
aside
and
made
a
sweeping
bow
allow
me
miss
jemima
to
make
you
a
mos
delicious
cup
of
coffee
and
while
the
little
hostess
prepared
the
meal
a
man
looked
out
from
the
partly
open
door
behind
her
with
big
dark
eyes
which
were
like
her
own
yet
blurred
by
a
mist
of
pity
and
of
love
susan
said
the
hostess
presently
it
ready
now
and
we
say
grace
so
do
you
talk
an
annoy
your
mother
the
tiny
brown
head
was
bowed
the
tiny
brown
hands
with
their
fingers
were
placed
on
the
table
edge
but
miss
susan
jemima
sat
bolt
upright
though
listening
it
seemed
to
the
words
of
reverence
falling
from
a
lips
lord

us
thankful
for
the
blackberries
an
the
coffee
an
an
all

blessin
but
please
sir

that
tastes
jus
a
little
better
if
you
do
mind
amen
and
the
man
who
leaned
against
the
door
and
watched
had
also
bowed
his
head
a
pain
was
in
his
throat
and
in
his
heart
a
pain
that
gripped
him
till
two
great
tears
rolled
down
his
cheek
and
were
lost
in
his
straggling
beard
virgie
he
whispered
hoarsely
virgie
she
started
at
the
sound
and
looked
about
her
wondering
then
as
the
name
was
called
again
she
slid
from
her
chair
and
ran
forward
with
a
joyous
cry
why
daddy
is
it
you
is
she
stopped
for
the
man
had
placed
a
finger
on
his
lip
and
was
pointing
to
the
door
take
a
look
down
the
road
he
ordered
in
a
guarded
voice
and
when
she
had
reached
a
point
commanding
the
danger
zone
he
asked
see
anybody
soldiers
she
shook
her
head
hear
anything
she
stood
for
a
moment
listening
then
ran
to
him
and
sprang
into
his
waiting
arms
it
all
right
daddy
it
all
right
now
he
raised
her
strained
her
to
his
breast
his
cheek
against
her
own
my
little
girl
he
murmured
between
his
kisses
my
little
rebel
and
as
she
snuggled
in
his
arms
her
fingers
clasped
tightly
about
his
neck
he
asked
her
wistfully
did
you
miss
me
much
yes
she
nodded
looking
into
his
eyes
yes
in
the
night
time
when
the
wind
was
talkin
but
after
while
when
why
daddy
he
had
staggered
as
he
set
her
down
sinking
into
a
chair
and
closing
his
eyes
as
he
leaned
on
the
table
edge
you
are
hurt
she
cried
i
i
can
see
the
blood
the
wounded
southerner
braced
himself
no
dear
no
he
strove
to
reassure
her
it
is
anything
only
a
little
scratch
from
a
yank
that
tried
to
get
me
but
he
did
though
the
soldier
added
with
a
smile
i
just
tired
the
child
regarded
him
in
wondering
awe
speaking
in
a
whisper
did
he
did
he
at
you
her
father
nodded
with
his
hand
on
her
tumbled
hair
yes

afraid
he
did
but
i
so
used
to
it
now
i
do
mind

more

drink
of
water

as
virgie
obeyed
in
silence
returning
with
the
dripping
gourd
the
man
went
on
i
tried
to
get
here
yesterday
but
i
could
they
chased
me
when
i
came
before
and
now
they
watching
he
paused
to
sip
at
his
draught
of
water
glancing
toward
the
carriage
road
big
fight
down
the
river
listen
can
you
hear
the
guns
yes
plain
she
answered
tilting
her
tiny
head
an
las
night
when
i
went
to
bed
i
could
hear
oh
ever
so
loud
boom
boom
so
i
knelt
up
an
asked
the
lord
not
to
let
any
of
hit
you
two
arms
in
their
tattered
gray
slipped
round
the
child
he
kissed
her
in
that
strange
fierce
passion
of
a
man
who
has
lost
his
mate
and
his
love
is
magnified
in
the
mite
who
reflects
her
image
and
her
memory
did
you
honey
he
asked
with
a
trembling
lip
well
i
reckon
that
saved
your
daddy
for
not
one
shell
touched
him
no
not
one
he
kissed
her
again
and
laughed
and
i
tell
you
virgie
they
were
coming
as
thick
as
bees
once
more
he
sipped
at
the
grateful
cooling
draught
of
water
when
the
child
asked
suddenly
how
is
lee
down
came
the
gourd
upon
the
table
the
southerner
was
on
his
feet
with
a
stiffened
back
and
his
dusty
slouch
hat
was
in
his
hand
he
well
god
bless
him
well
the
tone
was
deep
and
tender
proud
but
as
reverent
as
the
prayer
for
her
father
immunity
from
harm
yet
the
man
who
spoke
sank
back
into
his
seat
closing
his
eyes
and
repeating
slowly
sadly
he
well
god
bless
him
but
he
tired
darling
mighty
tired
daddy
the
soldier
daughter
asked
will
you
tell
him
somethin
from
me
yes
dear
what
tell
him
said
the
child
with
a
thoughtful
glance
at
miss
susan
jemima
across
the
table
tell
him
if
he
ever
marches
along
this
way
i
come
over
to
his
tent
and
rub
his
head
like
i
do
yours
if
let
me
till
he
goes
to
sleep
she
clasped
her
fingers
and
looked
into
her
father
eyes
hopefully
appealingly
do
you
think
he
would
if
if
i
washed
my
hands
real
clean
the
southerner
bit
his
lip
and
tried
to
smile
yes
honey
i
know
he
would
and
think
he
sent
a
message
to
did
he
she
asked
flushed
with
happiness
what
did
he
say
daddy
what
he
said
her
father
answered
taking
her
hands
in
his
a
brave
little
soldier
to
stay
there
all
alone
dixie
and
i
are
proud
of
her
oh
daddy
did
he
did
he
yes
dear
yes
the
soldier
nodded
his
very
words
and
look
from
his
boot
leg
he
took
a
folded
paper
and
spread
it
on
his
knee
he
wrote
you
a
pass
to
richmond
can
you
read
it
virgie
leaned
against
her
father
shoulder
studying
the
paper
long
and
earnestly
then
presently
looked
up
with
a
note
of
grave
but
courteous
hesitation
in
her
tone
well
he
well
the
writes
a
awful
bad
hand
daddy
her
father
laughed
in
genuine
delight
vowing
in
his
heart
to
tell
his
general
and
friend
of
this
crushing
criticism
if
ever
the
fates
of
war
permitted
them
to
meet
again
dead
right
he
agreed
with
hearty
promptness
but
come
i
read
it
for
you
now
then
listen
headquarters
of
the
army
of
northern
virginia
cary
and
escort
through
all
confederate
lines
and
give
wherever
lee
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
then
virgie
looked
up
with
tears
in
her
eyes
and
voice
an
he
did
that
for
little
oh
daddy
i
love
him
so
much
it
it
makes
me
want
to
cry
she
hid
her
face
on
the
coat
of
gray
and
sobbed
while
her
father
stroked
her
hair
and
answered
soothingly
but
in
a
tone
of
mourning
reverie
so
do
we
all
darling
big
grown
men
who
have
suffered
and
are
losing
all
they
love
they
are
ragged
and
wounded
hungry
and
oh
so
tired
but
when
they
think
of
they
draw
up
their
belts
another
hole
and
say
general
lee
and
then
they
can
fight
and
fight
and
fight
till
their
hearts
stop
beating
and
the
god
of
battles
writes
them
a
bloody
pass
again
he
had
risen
to
his
feet
he
was
speaking
proudly
in
the
reckless
passion
of
the
yet
unconquered
southerner
only
of
the
tot
who
watched
him
wondering
so
she
came
to
him
quickly
taking
his
hand
in
both
her
own
and
striving
to
bring
him
comfort
from
the
fountain
of
her
little
do
you
worry
we
we
whip
yet
no
dear
no
he
sighed
as
he
dropped
into
his
seat
we
wo
hard
enough
on
men
but
harder
still
on
children
such
as
you
he
turned
to
her
gravely
earnestly
virgie
i
had
hoped
to
get
you
through
to
richmond
but
i
ca
the
yankees
have
cut
us
off
they
are
up
the
river
and
down
the
river
and
all
around
us
i
been
nearly
the
whole
night
getting
here
creeping
through
the
woods
like
an
old
with
the
blue
boys
everywhere
waiting
to
get
me
if
i
showed
my
head
but
they
did
did
they
said
virgie
laughing
at
his
reference
to
the
wise
old
rabbit
and
feeling
for
the
pockets
of
his
shabby
coat
did
you
did
you
bring
me
anything
at
her
question
the
man
cried
out
as
if
in
pain
then
reached
for
her
in
a
wave
of
yearning
tenderness
listen
dear
i
i
had
a
little
bundle
for
you
of
of
things
to
eat
he
took
her
by
the
arms
and
looked
into
her
quaint
wise
face
and
i
was
so
glad
i
had
it
darling
for
you
are
thinner
than
you
were
he
paused
to
bite
his
lip
and
continued
haltingly
there
was
bread
in
that
bundle
and
meat
real
meat
and
sugar
and
tea
virgie
released
herself
and
clapped
her
hands
oh
daddy
where
is
it
she
asked
him
happily
once
more
reaching
for
the
pocket
i
hungry
for
somethin
good
do
do
he
cried
as
he
drew
his
coat
away
roughly
fiercely
in
the
pain
of
unselfish
suffering
for
daddy
sake
do
why
what
is
it
daddy
she
asked
in
her
shrillness
of
a
alarm
her
eyes
on
the
widening
stain
of
red
above
his
waist
is
is
it
hurtin
you
again
what
is
it
your
bundle
he
answered
in
the
flat
dull
tone
of
utter
hopelessness
i
lost
it
virgie
i
lost
it
oh
she
said
with
a
quaver
of
disappointment
which
she
vainly
strove
to
hide
how
did
you
do
it
for
a
moment
the
man
leaned
limply
against
a
hiding
his
eyes
with
one
trembling
hand
then
he
spoke
in
shamed
apology
i
i
could
help
it
darling
because
you
see
i
had
any
powder
left
and
i
was
coming
through
the
woods
just
as
i
told
you
when
the
yanks
got
sight
of
me
he
smiled
down
at
her
bravely
striving
to
add
a
dash
of
comedy
to
his
tragic
plight
and
i
tell
you
virgie
your
old
dad
had
to
run
like
a
turkey
wishing
to
the
lord
he
had
wings
too
virgie
did
not
smile
in
turn
and
her
father
dropped
back
into
his
former
tone
his
pale
lips
setting
in
a
straight
hard
line
and
then
the
blue
boy
i
was
telling
you
about
when
he
shot
at
me
i
must
have
stumbled
because
when
i
scrambled
up
i
i
could
see
just
right
so
i
ran
and
ran
thinking
of
you
darling
and
wanting
to
get
to
you
before
well
before
it
was
breakfast
time
i
had
your
bundle
in
my
pocket
but
when
i
fell
why
virgie
do
you
see
i
i
could
go
back
and
find
it
he
paused
to
choke
then
spoke
between
his
teeth
in
fury
at
a
strength
which
had
failed
to
breast
a
barrier
of
fate
but
i
have
gone
back
if
i
had
any
powder
left
i
have
i
would
a
pitiful
apology
it
was
from
a
man
to
a
little
child
a
story
told
only
in
its
hundredth
part
for
why
should
he
give
its
untold
horrors
to
a
baby
ears
how
could
she
understand
that
in
the
early
dawn
the
fugitive
with
an
empty
pistol
on
his
hip
wading
swamps
and
plunging
through
the
tangled
underbrush
alert
and
listening
darting
from
tree
to
tree
where
the
woods
were
thin
crouching
behind
some
fallen
log
to
catch
his
laboring
breath
then
rising
again
to
creep
along
his
way
he
did
not
tell
of
the
racking
pain
in
his
weary
legs
nor
the
protest
of
his
pounding
heart
the
strain
the
agony
the
puffs
of
smoke
that
floated
above
the
pines
and
the
ping
of
bullets
whining
through
the
trees
he
did
not
tell
of
the
ball
that
slid
along
his
ribs
leaving
a
fiery
aching
memory
behind
as
the
man
crashed
down
a
clay
bank
to
lie
for
an
instant
in
a
crumpled
heap
to
rise
and
stumble
on
not
toward
the
haven
of
his
own
confederate
lines
but
forward
to
where
a
baby
waited
through
a
dancing
mist
of
red
and
so
the
soldier
made
his
poor
apology
turning
his
head
away
to
avoid
a
dreaded
look
in
virgie
big
reproachful
eyes
then
he
added
one
more
lashwelt
to
his
shame
and
now
your
poor
old
daddy
is
no
more
use
to
you
i
come
to
my
little
girl
with
empty
hands
with
an
empty
gun
and
an
empty
heart
he
said
it
bitterly
in
the
sorrow
of
his
soul
and
his
courage
which
had
borne
him
through
a
hell
of
suffering
now
broke
but
only
when
a
helper
of
the
helpless
failed
he
laid
his
outflung
arms
across
the
table
he
bowed
his
beaten
head
upon
them
and
sobbed
aloud
with
sobs
that
shook
him
to
his
heels
it
was
then
that
virgie
came
to
him
again
a
little
daughter
of
the
south
who
like
a
hundred
thousand
of
her
sisters
brought
comfort
in
the
blackest
hours
one
tiny
weak
arm
was
slipped
about
his
neck
one
tiny
brown
hand
with
its
fingers
was
run
through
his
tangled
hair
softly
tenderly
even
as
she
longed
to
soothe
the
weary
head
of
general
lee
do
cry
she
murmured
in
his
ear
it
all
right
can
eat
the
blackberries
they
they
do
taste
so
good
when
you
have
the
time
but
do
mind
she
paused
to
kiss
him
then
tried
once
more
to
buoy
his
hope
and
hers
we
have
heaps
of
things
when
we
get
to
richmon
jus
heaps
an
then
she
stopped
abruptly
lifting
her
head
and
listening
in
the
manner
of
a
sheep
dog
scenting
danger
from
afar
her
father
looked
up
sharply
and
gripped
her
hands
virgie
you
hear
horses
oh
a
lot
of
on
the
big
road
it
was
true
for
down
the
breeze
came
the
faintly
echoed
thud
of
many
hoofs
and
the
clinking
jingle
of
sabers
against
the
riders
thighs
virgie
turned
back
from
the
open
door
why
why
they
turned
into
road
her
breath
came
fast
as
she
sank
her
voice
to
a
faint
awed
whisper
daddy
do
you
reckon
it
yes
said
her
father
who
had
risen
to
his
feet
morrison
cavalry
they
wo
hurt
but
i
have
to
get
to
the
woods
again
honey
he
kissed
her
hurriedly
and
started
for
the
door
but
shrank
into
the
shadow
at
sight
of
a
watcher
sharply
outlined
on
the
crest
of
a
distant
rise
escape
was
cut
off
and
the
hunted
soldier
turned
to
virgie
in
his
need
shut
the
door
quick
she
obeyed
in
silence
lock
it
she
turned
the
rusty
key
and
waited
now
the
windows
hurry
but
do
it
quietly
she
closed
the
clumsy
shutters
and
set
the
heavy
bars
into
their
slots
then
the
man
came
forward
knelt
down
before
her
and
took
her
hands
listen
virginia
he
whispered
earnestly
do
you
remember
how
your
dear
dear
mother
and
i
too
darling
always
told
you
never
to
tell
a
lie
an
i
have
she
protested
wondering
an
i
have
why
yes
yes
i
know
he
interrupted
hurriedly
but
now
as
the
child
stepped
backward
and
tried
to
draw
away
he
clasped
her
hands
more
tightly
still
but
listen
dear
it
to
save
do
you
understand
and
it
when
those
men
come
they
must
find
me
say
i
here
but
i
gone
if
they
ask
which
way
tell
them
i
went
down
past
the
spring
through
the
blackberry
patch
do
you
understand
and
can
you
remember
she
nodded
gravely
and
the
southerner
folded
her
tightly
in
his
arms
be
a
brave
little
rebel
honey
he
released
her
and
began
to
mount
the
ladder
leading
to
the
scuttle
in
the
ceiling
but
halfway
up
he
paused
as
virgie
checked
him
with
a
solemn
question
daddy
would
lee
want
me
to
tell
that
lie
yes
dear
he
answered
slowly
thoughtfully
this
once
and
if
ever
you
see
him
ask
him
and
he
tell
you
so
himself
god
help
you
darling
it
for
general
lee
and
the
littlest
rebel
sighed
as
though
a
weight
had
been
lifted
from
her
mind
and
she
cocked
her
head
at
the
sound
of
louder
on
the
carriage
road
all
right
i
tell
a
chapter
v
the
man
crawled
up
through
the
scuttle
hole
and
disappeared
then
drew
the
ladder
after
him
and
closed
the
trap
while
virgie
tiptoed
to
the
table
and
slipped
into
a
seat
the
cabin
was
now
in
except
for
a
shaft
of
sunlight
entering
through
the
jagged
wound
from
the
above
the
door
and
it
fell
on
the
quaint
brown
head
of
little
miss
virginia
cary
and
the
placid
form
of
susan
jemima
perching
opposite
in
serene
contempt
of
the
coming
of
a
conquering
host
the
jingling
clank
of
sabers
grew
louder
to
the
listeners
ears
through
the
rumble
of
pounding
hoofs
a
bugle
note
came
winnowing
across
the
fields
and
virgie
leaned
forward
with
a
confidential
whisper
to
her
doll
susan
jemima
i
would
tell
anybody
else
no
not
for
anything
but
i
am
awful
scared
there
came
a
scurrying
rush
a
command
to
halt
and
a
rustling
scraping
noise
of
dismounting
men
a
pause
and
the
sharp
loud
rap
of
a
saber
hilt
against
the
door
virgie
breathed
hard
but
made
no
answer
open
up
called
a
voice
outside
but
the
little
rebel
closed
her
lips
and
sat
staring
at
susan
jemima
across
the
table
a
silence
followed
short
yet
filled
with
dread
then
came
a
order
and
the
crash
of
carbine
butts
on
the
stout
oak
door
for
a
time
it
resisted
hopefully
then
slowly
its
top
sagged
in
with
a
groaning
grating
protest
from
its
rusty
hinges
it
swayed
collapsed
in
a
cloud
of
dust
and
the
enemy
swept
over
it
they
came
with
a
rush
in
the
lead
an
officer
a
naked
saber
in
his
fist
followed
by
a
squad
of
troopers
each
with
his
carbine
cocked
and
ready
for
discharge
yet
as
suddenly
as
they
had
come
they
halted
now
at
the
sight
of
a
little
lady
seated
at
table
eating
berries
as
calmly
as
though
the
dogs
of
war
had
never
even
growled
a
wondering
silence
followed
till
broken
by
a
piping
voice
in
grave
but
courteous
reproof
i
i
do
think
you
are
very
polite
the
officer
in
command
was
forced
to
smile
i
sorry
my
dear
he
apologized
but
am
afraid
this
time
i
quite
help
it
he
glanced
at
the
door
of
the
adjoining
room
and
turned
to
his
waiting
men
though
speaking
in
an
undertone
he
in
there
i
guess
do
fire
if
you
can
help
it
on
account
of
the
baby
now
then
steady
boys
advance
he
led
the
way
six
troopers
following
while
the
rest
remained
behind
to
guard
the
cabin
open
door
virgie
slowly
turned
her
head
with
eyes
that
watched
the
officer
every
move
then
presently
she
called
hey
there
that
room
an
do
bother
any
of
my
things
either
this
one
command
at
least
was
implicitly
obeyed
for
in
a
moment
the
disappointed
squad
returned
the
carbine
butts
were
grounded
the
troopers
stood
at
orderly
attention
while
their
officer
stepped
toward
the
table
what
your
name
little
monkey
virgie
raised
her
eyes
in
swift
reproach
i
do
like
to
be
called
a
monkey
it
it
is
respectful
the
union
soldier
laughed
i
see
he
touched
his
hat
and
made
her
a
sweeping
bow
a
thousand
pardons
mademoiselle
he
shot
his
sword
into
its
scabbard
and
laughed
again
might
i
inquire
as
to
what
you
are
called
by
your
er
justly
respectful
relatives
and
friends
virgie
she
answered
simply
ah
he
approved
and
a
very
pretty
name
virgie
what
my
whole
name
is
miss
virginia
houston
gary
the
soldier
started
glanced
at
his
troopers
then
back
to
the
child
again
is
herbert
cary
your
father
he
waited
for
her
answer
and
got
it
straight
from
a
baby
shoulder
herbert
cary
is
yes
sir
the
enemy
smiled
and
made
her
another
bow
i
stand
corrected
where
is
your
father
now
virgie
hesitated
i
i
do
know
the
voice
of
her
inquisitor
took
on
a
sterner
tone
is
he
here
hiding
somewhere
tell
me
her
little
heart
was
pounding
horribly
and
the
hot
blood
came
into
her
cheeks
but
she
looked
him
squarely
in
the
face
and
lied
for
general
lee
no
sir
daddy
here
but
he
gone
away
the
enemy
was
looking
at
her
intently
and
his
handsome
piercing
eyes
grew
most
uncomfortable
she
hung
for
an
instant
between
success
and
sobbing
failure
till
a
bubble
from
mother
eve
rose
up
in
her
youthful
blood
and
burst
into
a
spray
of
perfect
feminine
deceit
she
did
not
try
to
add
to
her
simple
statement
but
began
to
eat
her
berries
calmly
as
though
the
subject
were
completely
closed
which
way
did
he
go
the
officer
demanded
and
she
pointed
with
her
spoon
down
by
the
spring
through
the
blackberry
patch
the
soldier
was
he
stood
for
a
moment
looking
at
the
floor
then
asked
her
sharply
suddenly
if
your
father
had
gone
then
why
did
you
lock
that
door
she
faltered
but
only
for
an
instant
i
thought
you
might
be
the
man
before
her
clenched
his
hands
as
he
thought
of
that
hideous
danger
menacing
the
south
i
see
he
answered
gently
i
see
he
turned
away
but
even
as
he
turned
his
eye
was
caught
by
the
cupboard
against
the
wall
what
do
you
keep
in
there
he
asked
and
the
child
smiled
faintly
a
trifle
sadly
in
reply
we
to
keep
things
to
eat
when
we
had
any
he
noted
her
mild
evasion
and
pushed
the
point
what
is
in
it
now
tin
pans
anything
else
er
yes
sir
he
caught
his
breath
and
stepped
a
little
nearer
bending
till
his
face
was
close
to
hers
what
colonel
mosby
declared
the
mite
with
a
most
emphatic
nod
an
you
better
look
out
too
the
officer
laughed
as
he
turned
to
his
grinning
squad
bright
little
youngster
still
i
think
we
have
a
look
he
dropped
his
air
of
amusement
growing
stern
again
now
men
ready
they
swung
into
line
and
faced
the
cupboard
the
muzzles
of
their
carbines
trained
upon
it
while
their
leader
advanced
swung
open
the
doors
and
quickly
stepped
aside
on
the
bottom
shelf
as
virgie
had
declared
were
a
few
disconsolate
tin
pans
yet
tacked
to
the
door
was
a
picture
print
of
mosby
that
dreaded
guerrilla
whose
very
name
was
a
bugaboo
in
the
union
lines
the
littlest
rebel
flung
back
her
head
and
laughed
my
but
you
looked
funny
she
cried
to
the
somewhat
disconcerted
officer
pointing
at
him
with
her
spoon
if
a
mouse
had
jumped
out
i
reckon
it
would
have
scared
you
mos
to
death
the
officer
cheeks
flushed
red
in
spite
of
his
every
effort
at
control
nor
was
he
assisted
by
the
knowledge
that
his
men
were
tittering
behind
his
back
he
turned
upon
them
sharply
that
will
do
he
said
and
gave
a
brusque
command
corporal
deploy
your
men
and
make
a
thorough
search
outside
examine
the
ground
around
the
spring
and
report
yes
sir
returned
corporal
dudley
saluting
and
dropping
his
hand
across
his
mouth
to
choke
off
an
exclamation
of
anger
then
he
snarled
at
his
men
to
ease
the
pain
of
thwarted
vengeance
right
face
forward
march
the
squad
trooped
out
across
the
broken
door
leaving
their
commanding
officer
alone
with
his
rebel
prisoner
now
virgie
he
asked
in
a
kindly
tone
though
holding
her
eyes
with
his
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
cross
your
heart
that
you
are
here
just
by
yourself
er
no
sir
as
he
opened
his
lips
to
speak
she
pointed
to
her
doll
me
an
susan
jemima
well
that
a
fact
he
laughed
hanged
if
i
not
losing
all
my
social
polish
he
gallantly
removed
his
hat
bowed
gravely
to
the
cedar
stick
and
shook
its
hand
charmed
to
make
your
acquaintance
miss
susan
believe
me
my
own
name
is
morrison
morrison
at
your
service
he
turned
to
the
little
mother
with
a
smile
that
showed
a
row
of
white
and
even
teeth
and
now
he
said
since
we
are
all
informally
introduced
suppose
we
have
a
quiet
comfortable
chat
he
paused
but
she
made
no
answer
well
are
you
going
to
ask
me
to
have
some
breakfast
virgie
cast
a
troubled
gaze
into
the
plate
before
her
er
no
sir
what
why
not
she
faltered
and
answered
slowly
you
one
of
the
damn
yankees
oh
oh
oh
exclaimed
the
soldier
shocked
to
hear
a
baby
lips
profaned
little
girls
should
use
such
words
why
virgie
she
raised
her
eyes
clear
fearless
filled
with
vindicating
innocence
well
it
your
is
it
calls
you
that
um
yes
he
admitted
striving
to
check
the
twitching
of
his
lips
i
suppose
they
do
south
of
washington
but
do
you
know
we
are
just
like
other
people
she
shook
her
head
oh
yes
we
are
why
have
a
little
girl
at
home
not
any
bigger
than
you
have
you
asked
virgie
her
budding
racial
prejudice
at
war
with
youthful
curiosity
what
her
name
gertrude
he
answered
softly
tenderly
gertrude
morrison
would
you
like
to
see
her
picture
yes
said
the
little
rebel
and
stepped
across
the
gulf
which
had
lain
between
her
and
her
enemy
you
can
sit
down
if
you
want
to
jus
put
susan
jemima
on
the
table
thank
you
returned
her
visitor
obeying
instructions
seating
himself
and
loosening
the
upper
buttons
of
his
coat
on
his
neck
suspended
by
a
chain
was
a
silver
locket
containing
the
miniature
of
a
plump
and
pretty
child
it
had
lain
there
since
the
war
began
through
many
a
bivouac
many
a
weary
march
and
even
in
the
charge
he
could
feel
it
tapping
against
his
breast
so
now
as
he
held
it
out
to
virgie
the
father
hand
was
trembling
there
she
is
my
gertrude
my
little
gertrude
virgie
leaned
forward
eagerly
oh
she
said
in
unaffected
admiration
she
pretty
she
the
child
stopped
suddenly
and
raised
her
eyes
an
fat
too
i
reckon
gertrude
gets
lots
to
eat
does
she
why
yes
agreed
the
father
thinking
of
his
comfortable
northern
home
of
course
do
you
virgie
weighed
the
question
thoughtfully
before
she
spoke
sometimes
when
daddy
gets
through
the
lines
and
brings
it
to
me
the
soldier
started
violently
wrenched
back
from
the
selfish
dream
of
happiness
that
rose
as
he
looked
at
the
picture
of
his
child
what
is
why
your
father
comes
yes
sir
i
did
know
i
thought
he
came
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
turned
away
his
thoughts
atumble
a
pang
of
parental
pity
gnawing
at
his
heart
then
he
wheeled
and
faced
her
asking
with
a
break
in
his
husky
voice
and
at
other
times
what
do
you
eat
then
she
made
a
quaint
depreciating
gesture
toward
the
appointments
of
her
breakfast
table
blackberries
an
an
coffee
made
out
of
again
the
troubled
conqueror
turned
away
oh
it
a
shame
he
muttered
between
his
teeth
a
wicked
shame
he
stood
for
a
moment
silently
till
virgie
spoke
and
jarred
him
with
another
confidence
my
cousin
norris
told
me
that
the
yankees
have
bread
every
day
tea
an
milk
an
everything
butter
this
article
of
common
diet
was
mentioned
with
an
air
of
reverential
awe
and
somehow
it
hurt
the
union
officer
far
more
than
had
she
made
some
direct
accusation
against
the
invading
armies
of
the
north
do
virgie
please
he
murmured
softly
there
are
some
things
we
just
ca
bear
to
listen
to
even
in
times
of
war
he
sighed
and
dropped
into
his
former
seat
striving
gently
to
change
the
subject
you
have
lived
here
always
oh
no
she
assured
him
with
a
lift
of
her
small
patrician
brows
is
the
overseer
house
house
used
to
be
up
on
the
hill
in
the
grove
to
be
yes
sir
but
but
the
yankees
burnt
it
up
morrison
fist
came
down
on
the
table
with
a
crash
he
remembered
now
his
raid
of
some
months
before
upon
this
same
plantation
so
unfamiliar
in
its
present
neglected
state
again
he
looked
into
the
fearless
eyes
of
a
southern
gentlewoman
who
mocked
him
while
her
lover
husband
swam
the
river
and
escaped
again
he
saw
the
mansion
wrapped
in
flame
and
smoke
the
work
of
a
drunken
fiend
in
his
own
command
yes
he
remembered
now
too
well
then
he
turned
to
the
child
and
spoke
tell
me
about
it
wo
you
she
nodded
wriggled
from
her
chair
and
stood
beside
the
table
oh
it
was
a
long
time
ago
a
month
maybe
an
they
came
after
our
horses
mamma
an
me
were
all
by
ourselves
uncle
billy
and
sally
ann
an
we
were
dreadful
scared
an
we
hid
in
the
ice
house
she
paused
her
listener
had
leaned
his
elbow
on
the
table
his
hand
across
his
eyes
yes
dear
go
on
the
child
had
been
standing
opposite
with
susan
jemima
and
the
pot
between
them
but
gradually
she
began
to
edge
a
little
nearer
till
presently
she
stood
beside
him
fingering
a
shiny
button
on
his
coat
an
the
blue
boys
ate
up
everything
we
had
an
took
our
corn
an
when
they
went
away
from
our
house
they
a
man
set
it
on
fire
but
another
man
got
real
mad
with
him
an
an
shot
him
know
uncle
billy
put
him
in
the
ground
she
paused
then
sank
her
voice
to
a
whisper
of
mysterious
dread
an
i
saw
him
do
think
about
it
virgie
begged
morrison
slipping
his
arm
about
the
mite
and
trying
not
to
put
his
own
beloved
ones
in
the
little
rebel
place
what
happened
then
we
came
to
live
here
said
virgie
but
mamma
got
sick
oh
she
got
terrible
sick
an
one
night
daddy
came
through
and
put
her
in
the
ground
too
but
says
she
jus
asleep
the
soldier
started
cary
dead
this
poor
tot
motherless
he
drew
the
baby
closer
to
him
stroking
her
hair
as
her
sleeping
mother
might
have
done
and
waited
for
the
rest
an
las
friday
sally
ann
went
away
i
do
know
where
an
what
asked
morrison
she
left
you
here
all
by
yourself
yes
sir
said
the
child
with
a
careless
laugh
but
do
mind
sally
ann
was
a
triflin
nigger
anyhow
you
see
wait
a
minute
he
interrupted
what
became
of
the
old
colored
man
who
uncle
billy
yes
sir
we
sent
him
up
to
richmond
to
get
some
things
but
he

to

aunt
margaret

but
he
ca
the
yankees

up
the
river
an
down
the
river
an
an
everywhere
an
he
ca
she
paused
as
morrison
turned
to
her
from
his
restless
pacing
up
and
down
my
but
you
got
fine
daddy
are
all
rags
with
with
holes
in
he
could
not
answer
there
was
nothing
for
him
to
say
and
virgie
scorched
him
with
another
question
what
did
you
come
after
daddy
for
oh
not
because
i
to
little
girl
he
burst
out
harshly
but
you
would
understand
he
had
turned
away
and
was
gazing
through
the
open
door
listening
to
the
muttered
wrath
of
the
big
black
guns
far
down
the
river
it
war
one
of
the
hateful
pitiful
things
of
war
i
came
because
i
had
my
orders
from
your
he
lowered
his
chin
regarding
her
in
mild
astonishment
yes
my
general
an
do
you
love
like
love
lee
yes
dear
he
answered
earnestly
of
course
he
wondered
again
to
see
her
turn
away
in
sober
thought
tracing
lines
on
the
dusty
floor
with
one
small
brown
toe
for
the
child
was
wrestling
with
a
problem
if
a
soldier
had
orders
from
his
general
as
she
herself
might
put
it
he
was
to
come
but
still
it
was
hard
to
reconcile
such
duty
with
the
capture
of
her
father
therefore
she
raised
her
tiny
chin
and
resorted
to
tactics
of
a
purely
personal
nature
an
did
you
know
if
you
hurt
my
daddy
i
tell
uncle
fitz
lee
on
you
no
the
yankee
smiled
is
he
your
uncle
the
littlest
rebel
regarded
him
with
a
look
of
positive
pity
for
his
ignorance
he
uncle
she
stated
warmly
an
if
i
was
to
tell
him
he
come
right
after
you
an
an
lick
the
out
of
you
the
soldier
laughed
my
dear
he
confided
with
a
dancing
twinkle
in
hip
eye
to
tell
you
the
honest
truth
your
uncle
fitz
has
done
it
already
times
has
he
she
cried
in
rapturous
delight
oh
he
he
has
the
enemy
repeated
with
vigor
and
conviction
but
suppose
we
shift
our
conversation
to
matters
a
shade
more
pleasant
take
you
for
instance
you
see
he
stopped
abruptly
turning
his
head
and
listening
with
keen
intentness
what
that
he
asked
did
hear
anything
said
virgie
breathing
very
fast
but
she
too
had
heard
it
a
sound
above
them
a
scraping
sound
as
of
someone
lying
flat
along
the
rafters
and
shifting
his
position
and
while
she
spoke
a
telltale
bit
of
plaster
fell
and
broke
as
it
struck
the
floor
morrison
looked
up
starting
as
he
saw
the
outlines
of
the
closely
fitting
scuttle
for
the
loft
was
so
low
and
shallow
that
he
had
not
suspected
its
presence
from
an
outside
view
but
now
he
was
certain
of
the
fugitive
virgie
watched
him
trembling
growing
hot
in
the
pit
of
her
little
stomach
yet
when
he
faced
her
she
looked
him
squarely
in
the
eye
fighting
one
last
battle
for
her
daddy
as
hopeless
as
the
tottering
cause
of
the
stars
and
bars
you
you
do
think
he
can
fly
do
you
no
little
rebel
the
soldier
answered
gently
sadly
but
there
are
other
ways
he
glanced
at
the
table
measuring
its
height
with
the
pitch
of
the
ceiling
then
turned
to
her
again
is
your
father
in
that
loft
she
made
no
answer
but
began
to
back
away
tell
me
the
truth
look
at
me
still
no
answer
and
he
took
a
step
toward
her
speaking
sternly
do
you
hear
me
at
me
she
tried
but
her
courage
was
oozing
fast
she
had
done
her
best
but
now
it
was
more
than
the
mite
could
stand
so
she
bit
her
lip
to
stop
its
quivering
and
turned
her
head
away
for
a
moment
the
man
stood
silent
wondering
if
it
was
possible
that
the
child
had
been
coached
in
a
string
of
lies
to
trade
upon
his
tenderness
of
heart
then
he
spoke
in
a
voice
of
mingled
pity
and
reproach
and
so
you
told
me
a
story
and
all
the
rest
is
a
story
too
oh
virgie
virgie
i
did
she
cried
the
big
tears
breaking
out
at
last
i
tell
you
stories
only
jus
a
one
for
daddy
an
lee
she
was
sobbing
now
and
the
man
looked
down
upon
her
in
genuine
compassion
his
own
eyes
swimming
at
her
childish
grief
his
soldier
heart
athrob
and
aching
at
the
duty
he
must
perform
i
sorry
dear
he
sighed
removing
her
doll
and
dragging
the
table
across
the
floor
to
a
point
directly
beneath
the
scuttle
in
the
ceiling
what
are
you
goin
to
do
she
asked
in
terror
following
as
he
moved
oh
what
are
you
goin
to
do
he
did
not
reply
he
could
not
but
when
he
placed
a
chair
upon
the
table
and
prepared
to
mount
then
virgie
understood
you
sha
you
sha
she
cried
out
shrilly
he
my
daddy
and
you
sha
she
pulled
at
the
table
and
when
he
would
have
put
her
aside
as
gently
as
he
could
she
attacked
him
fiercely
in
a
childish
storm
of
passion
sobbing
striking
at
him
with
her
puny
fists
the
soldier
bowed
his
head
and
moved
away
oh
i
ca
i
ca
he
breathed
in
pain
there
be
some
other
way
and
still
he
stood
irresolute
gazing
through
the
open
door
watching
his
men
as
they
hunted
for
a
fellow
man
listening
to
the
sounds
that
floated
across
the
stricken
fields
the
calls
of
his
troopers
the
locusts
in
the
woods
chanting
their
shrill
harsh
litany
of
drought
but
more
insistent
still
came
the
muffled
boom
of
the
big
black
guns
far
down
the
muddy
james
they
called
to
him
these
guns
in
the
majesty
of
war
bidding
him
forget
himself
his
love
his
pity
all
else
but
the
grim
command
to
a
marching
host
a
host
that
must
reach
its
goal
though
it
marched
on
a
road
of
human
hearts
the
soldier
set
his
teeth
and
turned
to
the
little
rebel
deciding
on
his
course
of
action
best
for
her
best
for
the
man
who
lay
in
the
loft
above
though
now
it
must
seem
a
brutal
cruelty
to
both
well
virgie
he
said
since
you
have
told
me
what
i
want
to
know
i
have
to
take
you
and
give
you
to
the
yankees
he
stepped
toward
her
swiftly
and
caught
her
by
the
wrist
she
screamed
in
terror
fighting
to
break
his
hold
while
the
trap
above
them
opened
and
the
head
and
shoulders
of
the
southerner
appeared
his
pistol
held
in
his
outstretched
hand
drop
it
you
hound
he
ordered
fiercely
drop
it
the
northerner
released
his
captive
but
stood
unmoved
as
he
looked
into
the
pistol
muzzle
and
the
blazing
eyes
of
the
cornered
scout
i
sorry
he
said
in
quiet
dignity
i
very
sorry
but
i
had
to
bring
you
out
he
paused
then
spoke
again
and
you
need
bother
about
your
gun
if
you
had
any
ammunition
our
fire
would
have
been
returned
back
yonder
in
the
woods
the
game
up
cary
come
down
chapter
vi
the
head
and
shoulders
disappeared
a
short
pause
followed
then
the
ladder
came
slowly
down
and
the
southerner
descended
while
virgie
crouched
a
sobbing
little
heap
beside
her
doll
but
when
he
reached
the
bottom
rung
she
rose
to
her
feet
and
ran
to
meet
him
weeping
bitterly
oh
daddy
daddy
i
did
do
it
right
i
did
do
it
right
she
buried
her
head
in
his
tattered
coat
while
he
slipped
an
arm
about
her
and
tried
to
soothe
a
sorrow
too
great
for
such
a
tiny
heart
to
bear
but
you
did
do
it
right
he
told
her
it
was
my
fault
mine
my
leg
got
cramped
and
i
had
to
move
he
stooped
and
kissed
her
it
was
fault
honey
but
you
you
did
it
he
patted
her
cheek
then
turned
to
his
captor
with
a
grim
hard
smile
of
resignation
to
his
fate
well
colonel
you
had
a
long
chase
of
it
but
you
gotten
my
brush
at
last
the
union
soldier
faced
him
speaking
earnestly
captain
cary
you
a
brave
man
and
one
of
the
best
scouts
in
the
confederate
army
i
regret
this
happening
more
than
i
can
say
the
southerner
shrugged
his
shoulders
his
northern
captor
asked
are
you
carrying
dispatches
no
any
other
papers
of
any
kind
no
answer
came
and
he
added
sternly
it
is
quite
useless
to
refuse
give
them
to
me
he
held
out
his
hand
but
his
captive
only
looked
him
in
the
eyes
and
the
answer
though
spoken
in
an
undertone
held
a
world
of
quiet
meaning
you
can
take
it
the
federal
officer
bit
his
lip
and
yet
he
could
not
would
not
be
denied
his
request
became
demand
backed
by
authority
and
the
right
of
might
till
virgie
broke
in
in
a
piping
voice
of
indignation
you
ca
have
it
it
mine
my
pass
to
richmon
from
lee
morrison
turned
slowly
from
the
little
rebel
to
the
man
is
this
true
he
asked
the
southerner
flushed
and
for
reply
produced
the
rumpled
paper
from
his
boot
leg
and
handed
it
over
without
a
word
the
northerner
read
it
carefully
virginia
cary
and
escort
through
all
confederate
lines
and
give
wherever
lee
the
reader
crushed
the
paper
in
his
fist
while
his
hand
sank
slowly
to
his
side
then
he
raised
his
head
and
asked
in
a
voice
which
was
strangely
out
of
keeping
with
a
of
the
union
cavalry
and
who
was
to
be
her
escort
you
the
captive
nodded
smiling
his
sad
grim
smile
and
the
captor
swallowed
hard
as
he
moved
to
the
cabin
door
and
stood
listening
to
the
muttered
rumble
of
the
river
guns
i
sorry
cary
he
whispered
brokenly
more
sorry
than
you
can
understand
for
a
long
time
no
one
spoke
then
the
southerner
went
to
virgie
dropping
his
hand
in
tenderness
on
her
tumbled
hair
just
go
into
your
room
honey
i
want
to
talk
to
colonel
morrison
she
looked
up
at
him
doubtfully
but
he
added
with
a
reassuring
smile
it
all
right
darling
i
call
you
in
just
a
minute
still
virgie
seemed
to
hesitate
she
shifted
her
doubting
eyes
toward
the
union
officer
turned
and
obeyed
in
silence
closing
the
door
of
the
adjoining
room
behind
her
then
the
two
men
faced
each
other
without
the
hampering
presence
of
the
child
each
conscious
of
the
coming
tragedy
that
both
till
now
had
striven
manfully
to
hide
the
one
moved
forward
toward
a
seat
staggering
as
he
walked
and
catching
himself
on
the
table
edge
while
the
other
hand
went
out
to
lend
him
aid
but
the
southerner
waved
him
off
thank
you
he
said
as
he
sank
into
a
chair
i
do
help
from
why
not
asked
morrison
because
said
cary
in
sullen
anger
i
do
ask
quarter
nor
aid
from
a
man
who
frightens
children
the
northerner
chin
went
up
and
when
he
replied
his
voice
was
trembling
not
in
passion
but
with
a
deeper
finer
something
which
had
gripped
his
admiration
for
the
courage
of
a
child
and
i
would
hurt
a
hair
of
her
splendid
little
head
he
paused
then
spoke
again
more
calmly
you
thought
me
a
beast
to
frighten
her
but
do
you
know
it
was
the
only
thing
to
do
otherwise
my
men
might
have
had
to
shoot
you
before
her
eyes
cary
made
no
answer
though
now
he
understood
and
morrison
went
on
it
is
easy
for
me
to
track
a
fellow
creature
down
to
take
him
when
he
wounded
practically
unarmed
and
turn
him
over
to
a
firing
squad
but
it
war
my
friend
one
of
the
merciless
realities
of
war
and
you
ought
to
know
the
meaning
of
its
name
yes
i
know
returned
the
southerner
with
all
the
bitterness
of
a
hopeless
struggle
and
defeat
it
has
taken
three
years
to
teach
me
i
look
at
me
he
cried
as
he
stood
up
in
his
rags
and
spread
his
arms
look
at
my
country
swept
as
bare
as
a
stubble
field
you
whipped
us
maybe
with
your
millions
of
money
and
your
endless
men
and
now
you
are
warring
with
the
women
and
the
children
he
turned
his
back
and
spoke
in
the
deep
intensity
of
scorn
a
fine
thing
colonel
and
may
you
get
your
reward
the
northerner
set
his
lips
in
a
thin
cold
line
but
curbed
his
wrath
and
answered
the
accusation
quietly
there
are
two
sides
to
the
question
cary
there
must
be
one
then
fly
your
flag
in
justice
the
southerner
retorted
hotly
wheeling
on
his
enemy
with
blazing
eyes
and
with
hands
that
shook
in
the
stress
of
passion
a
while
ago
you
called
me
a
brave
man
and
a
good
scout
and
because
i
both
your
people
have
set
a
price
on
me
five
hundred
dollars
alive
or
dead
he
laughed
a
hoarse
harsh
travesty
of
mirth
and
added
with
a
lip
that
curled
in
withering
contempt
alive
or
dead
a
gentleman
and
a
scout
for
just
half
the
price
of
one
good
sound
nigger
by
heaven
it
makes
me
proud
morrison
looked
across
the
table
at
his
prisoner
and
answered
gravely
yet
with
a
touch
of
sternness
in
his
military
tone
you
are
more
than
a
scout
cary
you
carried
dispatches
and
intercepted
ours
for
both
of
which
if
taken
you
would
have
been
a
prisoner
of
war
no
more
but
you
entered
our
lines
not
in
a
uniform
of
gray
and
you
cost
us
the
loss
of
two
important
battles
and
had
you
done
the
same
returned
the
southerner
for
you
it
would
have
meant
promotion
i
served
my
cause
as
best
i
could
in
the
saddle
or
the
rifle
pit
in
the
woods
or
creeping
through
your
lines
if
i
cost
you
a
battle
my
life
is
a
puny
price
to
pay
and
i
pay
it
without
a
sigh
he
paused
and
sank
into
his
seat
for
myself
i
do
care
much
i
worn
out
anyway
and
i
only
wanted
to
get
my
little
girl
to
richmond
at
the
thought
of
virgie
his
anger
returned
to
him
and
he
once
more
staggered
to
his
feet
but
you
he
accused
you
beaten
a
baby
by
the
force
of
arms
you
run
me
to
earth
and
you
blocked
her
chance
it
virgie
you
are
fighting
now
not
me
yes
just
as
if
you
rode
her
down
with
a
troop
of
horse
a
fine
thing
colonel
for
you
a
brevet
for
me
a
firing
squad
well
call
in
your
men
and
get
it
over
again
he
smiled
a
grim
slow
smile
of
bitterness
and
scorn
bravo
colonel
morrison
bravo
you
add
one
other
glory
to
your
conquering
sword
and
besides
receive
five
hundred
dollars
in
reward
the
northerner
turned
upon
him
fiercely
goaded
at
last
to
the
in
a
struggle
as
black
and
awful
as
the
struggle
of
his
stop
it
man
he
cried
i
order
you
to
stop
it
duty
not
a
miserable
reward
his
cheeks
were
flaming
his
muscles
quivered
and
his
fists
were
clenched
do
you
actually
suppose
he
asked
that
proud
of
this
do
you
think
i
wringing
blood
out
of
your
heart
and
mine
for
money
they
faced
each
other
two
crouching
snarling
animals
the
raw
primeval
passions
of
their
hearts
released
each
seeing
through
a
mist
of
red
a
mist
that
had
risen
up
to
roll
across
a
mighty
land
and
plunge
its
noblest
sons
into
a
bloody
ruck
of
war
they
faced
each
other
silently
then
slowly
the
features
of
the
southerner
relaxed
his
bitterness
was
laid
aside
he
spoke
in
the
soft
slow
accent
of
his
people
an
accent
so
impossible
to
a
trick
of
print
or
pen
i
glad
you
feel
that
way
and
maybe
after
all
you
doing
what
you
think
is
right
yes
and
i
know
it
hard
he
stopped
then
stepped
a
little
nearer
timidly
as
virgie
might
have
done
colonel
he
said
scarce
audibly
i
ask
you
just
one
thing
not
for
myself
but
for
her
for
virgie
get
the
poor
little
tad
through
your
lines
will
you
and
and
do
let
her
know
about
his
captor
did
not
answer
him
in
words
because
of
the
pain
that
took
him
by
the
throat
but
his
hand
went
out
till
it
reached
another
hand
that
gripped
it
gratefully
thank
you
morrison
said
the
prisoner
simply
if
it
was
war
times
he
choked
and
said
no
more
yet
silence
proved
more
eloquent
than
human
speech
they
were
men
brave
men
and
both
were
grateful
the
one
because
an
enemy
would
keep
his
unspoken
word
the
other
because
a
doomed
man
understood
cary
opened
the
door
of
his
daughter
room
and
called
to
her
she
came
in
quickly
a
question
in
her
big
brown
eyes
daddy
she
said
you
talked
a
mighty
long
time
it
was
a
heap
more
than
jus
a
minute
was
it
he
asked
and
forced
a
smile
well
you
see
we
had
a
lot
to
say
he
seated
himself
and
drawing
her
between
his
knees
took
both
her
hands
now
listen
honey
i
going
away
with
this
gentleman
and
he
stopped
as
she
looked
up
doubtfully
then
added
a
dash
of
gayety
to
his
tender
tone
oh
but
he
me
and
think
coming
back
for
to
send
you
up
to
richmond
now
that
just
fine
virgie
looked
slowly
from
her
father
to
the
union
soldier
who
stood
with
downcast
eyes
his
back
to
them
daddy
she
whispered
he
a
right
good
yankee
is
he
yes
dear
her
father
murmured
sadly
and
in
yearning
love
for
the
baby
he
must
leave
behind
yes
he
mighty
good
he
knelt
and
folded
her
in
his
arms
kissing
her
over
and
over
while
his
hand
went
fluttering
about
her
soft
brown
throat
then
he
wrenched
himself
away
but
stood
for
a
lingering
instant
more
his
hands
outstretched
atremble
for
a
last
and
lingering
touch
his
heart
a
racing
protest
at
the
parting
he
must
speak
cary
it
was
morrison
who
spoke
in
mercy
for
the
man
and
once
more
cary
understood
he
turned
to
cross
the
broken
door
to
face
a
firing
squad
in
the
hot
brown
woods
to
cross
the
gulf
which
stretched
beyond
the
rumble
of
the
guns
and
the
snarling
lip
of
war
but
even
as
he
turned
a
baby
voice
called
out
in
cheerful
parting
which
he
himself
had
failed
to
speak
i
see
you
up
in
richmon
the
eyes
of
the
two
men
met
and
held
in
the
hardest
moment
of
it
all
for
well
they
knew
this
hopeful
prophecy
could
never
be
fulfilled
morrison
sighed
and
moved
toward
the
door
but
from
its
threshold
he
could
see
his
troopers
returning
at
a
trot
across
the
fields
wait
he
said
to
cary
i
rather
my
men
should
know
i
talked
with
you
he
pointed
to
the
scuttle
in
the
ceiling
would
you
mind
if
i
asked
you
to
go
back
again
hurry
they
are
coming
the
captured
scout
saluted
crossed
to
the
ladder
and
began
to
mount
at
the
top
he
paused
to
smile
and
blow
a
kiss
to
virgie
then
disappeared
drew
up
the
ladder
after
him
and
closed
the
trap
the
captor
stood
in
silence
waiting
for
his
men
yet
while
he
stood
the
little
rebel
pattered
to
his
side
slipping
her
hand
in
his
confidingly
yankee
she
asked
and
looked
up
into
his
face
are
you
goin
to
let
daddy
come
to
richmon
too
morrison
withdrew
his
hand
from
hers
withdrew
it
sharply
flung
himself
into
a
seat
beside
the
table
and
began
to
scribble
on
the
back
of
virgie
rumpled
pass
while
the
child
stood
watching
trusting
with
the
simple
trust
of
her
little
in
a
moment
or
two
the
troopers
came
hurrying
in
with
corporal
dudley
in
the
lead
he
stood
at
attention
saluted
his
superior
and
made
his
report
of
failure
in
the
search
nothing
sir
no
tracks
around
the
spring
and
no
traces
of
the
fellow
anywhere
but
he
stopped
his
keen
eyes
marked
the
changed
position
of
the
table
and
followed
upward
he
saw
the
outlines
of
the
scuttle
above
his
head
and
smiled
but
i
glad
to
see
that
you
had
better
luck
yourself
yes
corporal
said
morrison
with
a
sharp
return
of
his
military
tone
i
think
i
found
the
fox
hole
at
last
he
rose
and
gave
his
orders
briskly
push
that
table
forward
there
below
the
trap
two
of
you
get
on
it
he
turned
to
the
corporal
while
he
himself
climbed
up
and
stood
beside
his
men
light
that
candle
and
pass
it
up
to
me
the
orders
were
obeyed
now
boys
boost
me
and
we
have
him
out
they
raised
him
till
he
pushed
the
trap
aside
and
thrust
his
head
and
shoulders
through
the
opening
from
below
they
could
see
him
as
he
waved
the
lighted
candle
to
and
fro
and
presently
they
heard
his
voice
that
sounded
deep
and
muffled
in
the
shallow
loft
all
right
boys
you
can
let
me
down
he
slid
to
the
table
and
sprang
lightly
to
the
floor
facing
his
troopers
with
a
smile
half
in
seeming
disappointment
as
he
glanced
at
virgie
i
afraid
the
little
rebel
right
again
is
there
oh
cried
virgie
then
clapped
her
hands
across
her
mouth
while
the
troopers
slowly
looked
from
her
into
the
level
eyes
of
their
commanding
officer
he
stood
before
them
straight
and
tall
a
soldier
every
inch
of
him
and
they
knew
that
morrison
was
lying
like
a
gentleman
they
knew
that
their
chief
was
staking
the
name
and
title
of
an
honorable
soldier
against
the
higher
grander
title
of
a
man
only
corporal
dudley
stood
disconcerted
at
the
startling
statement
but
as
there
was
no
help
for
it
he
could
only
strangle
an
oath
and
give
the
order
to
pass
out
right
face
forward
march
they
mounted
and
rode
a
rod
or
two
away
awaiting
orders
while
morrison
stood
silently
and
watched
them
go
he
too
like
virgie
had
wrestled
with
a
problem
and
it
stirred
him
to
the
depths
as
a
trooper
must
obey
so
also
must
an
officer
obey
a
higher
will
yes
even
as
a
slave
in
iron
manacles
the
master
of
war
had
made
his
laws
and
a
servant
broke
them
knowingly
a
captured
scout
was
a
prisoner
no
more
a
spy
must
hang
or
fall
before
the
volley
of
a
firing
squad
no
matter
for
his
bravery
no
matter
for
the
faithful
service
to
his
cause
the
man
must
die
the
glory
was
for
another
for
one
who
waved
a
flag
on
the
spine
of
a
bloody
trench
a
trench
which
his
brothers
stormed
and
gave
the
blood
no
matter
that
a
spy
had
made
this
triumph
possible
he
had
worn
a
uniform
which
was
not
his
own
and
the
dog
must
die
so
ruled
the
god
of
warfare
still
did
war
prescribe
disgrace
and
death
for
all
if
cary
had
crept
through
the
union
lines
to
reach
the
side
of
a
helpless
little
one
even
in
a
coat
of
would
the
great
tribunal
count
his
deed
accursed
should
fearless
human
love
reap
no
reward
beyond
the
crashing
epitaph
of
a
firing
squad
and
the
powder
smoke
that
drifted
with
the
passing
of
a
soul
no
no
breathed
morrison
in
god
name
give
the
man
his
chance
he
straightened
his
back
and
smiled
he
took
from
the
table
a
rumpled
paper
and
turned
to
the
littlest
factor
in
the
great
rebellion
here
virgie
here
your
pass
to
richmond
for
you
and
your
escort
through
the
federal
lines
she
came
to
him
slowly
wondering
her
tiny
body
quivering
with
suppressed
excitement
her
voice
a
whispering
caress
do
you
mean
for
for
daddy
too
yes
you
little
rebel
he
answered
choking
as
he
laughed
but
terribly
afraid
you
have
to
pay
me
with
a
kiss
she
sprang
into
his
waiting
arms
and
kissed
him
as
he
raised
her
up
but
when
he
would
have
set
her
down
her
little
brown
hands
with
their
fingers
clung
tightly
about
his
neck
wait
wait
she
cried
here
another
one
for
gertrude
tell
her
it
from
virgie
an
tell
her
i
sent
it
her
daddy
is
jus
the
best
damn
yankee
that
ever
was
the
trap
above
had
opened
and
the
head
and
shoulders
of
the
southerner
appeared
while
morrison
looked
up
and
spoke
in
parting
it
all
right
cary
i
only
ask
a
soldier
pledge
that
you
take
your
little
girl
to
richmond
nothing
more
in
passing
through
our
lines
whatever
you
see
or
hear
a
sacred
trust
it
was
of
man
to
man
one
brother
to
another
and
morrison
knew
that
herbert
cary
would
pass
through
the
very
center
of
the
federal
lines
as
a
not
a
spy
the
southerner
tried
to
speak
his
gratitude
but
the
words
refused
to
come
so
he
stretched
one
trembling
hand
toward
his
enemy
of
war
and
eased
his
heart
in
a
sobbing
broken
call
some
day
it
will
all
be
over
in
the
cabin
doorway
stood
virgie
and
her
father
hand
in
hand
they
watched
a
lonely
swallow
as
it
dipped
across
the
desolate
unfurrowed
field
they
listened
to
the
distant
beat
of
many
hoofs
on
the
river
road
and
the
far
faint
clink
of
sabers
on
the
riders
thighs
and
when
the
sounds
were
lost
to
the
listeners
at
last
the
notes
of
a
bugle
came
whispering
back
to
them
floating
dipping
even
as
the
swallow
dipped
across
the
unfurrowed
fields
but
still
the
two
stood
lingering
in
the
doorway
hand
in
hand
the
muddy
james
took
up
his
murmuring
song
again
the
locusts
chanted
in
the
hot
brown
woods
to
the
basso
growl
of
the
big
black
guns
far
down
the
river
a
sad
sad
song
it
was
yet
on
its
echoes
seemed
to
ride
a
haunting
hopeful
memory
of
the
rebel
broken
call
some
day
it
will
all
be
over
and
so
the
guns
growled
on
slow
sullen
thundering
forth
the
of
a
still
unconquered
enmity
but
only
that
peace
might
walk
some
day
in
the
path
of
the
shrieking
shells
chapter
vii
it
was
afternoon
and
over
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
james
where
the
old
turnpike
leads
up
over
the
rolling
hills
to
richmond
the
sun
was
pouring
down
a
flood
of
heat
the
was
ankle
deep
with
dust
and
the
fine
white
powder
churned
into
floury
softness
by
artillery
and
the
myriad
iron
heels
of
war
had
settled
down
on
roadside
bush
and
tree
and
vine
till
all
the
sweet
green
of
summer
hung
its
head
under
the
hot
weight
and
longed
for
a
cooling
shower
which
would
wash
it
clean
in
fairer
times
the
pike
had
been
an
active
thoroughfare
for
the
plantations
and
hundreds
of
smaller
truck
farms
which
fed
the
capitol
but
of
late
months
nearly
all
this
traffic
had
disappeared
for
the
days
of
the
confederacy
were
drawing
slowly
but
none
the
less
surely
to
a
close
inside
the
breastworks
and
far
flung
fortifications
which
encompassed
richmond
the
flower
of
the
rebel
arms
the
army
of
northern
virginia
lay
like
a
rat
caught
in
a
trap
on
three
sides
north
east
and
south
the
army
of
the
potomac
under
grant
beleaguered
the
city
while
the
tireless
sheridan
with
that
lately
developed
arm
of
the
federals
the
cavalry
raided
right
and
left
and
struck
hard
blows
at
the
crumbling
cause
where
they
were
least
expected
yet
in
this
same
dark
hour
there
had
been
a
ray
of
light
once
the
confederacy
had
come
within
hairbreadth
of
overwhelming
success
for
early
hard
riding
troopers
had
made
a
dash
for
washington
but
a
few
weeks
before
and
with
the
prize
almost
in
their
grasp
had
only
been
turned
back
by
a
great
force
which
the
grim
watchful
grant
suddenly
threw
in
between
their
guns
and
the
gleaming
dome
of
the
nation
capitol
but
even
this
small
success
was
not
for
long
for
when
early
crossing
over
into
the
luscious
valley
of
the
shenandoah
began
to
scourge
it
with
his
hosts
and
threaten
a
raid
into
pennsylvania
sheridan
broke
loose
from
the
restriction
of
telegraph
wires
and
followed
him
to
the
death
and
finally
broke
the
back
of
the
great
raid
with
his
mad
gallop
from
winchester
meanwhile
around
richmond
lee
and
grant
a
circle
within
a
circle
were
constantly
feeling
each
other
out
shifting
their
troops
from
point
to
point
in
attack
and
defense
for
all
the
world
like
two
fighting
dogs
hunting
for
an
opening
in
the
fence
and
all
the
time
the
grim
quiet
man
in
blue
kept
contracting
his
lines
around
the
wonderful
tactician
in
gray
until
the
whole
world
came
to
know
that
unless
lee
could
break
through
the
gap
to
the
southwest
the
end
of
the
war
was
plainly
in
sight
and
so
it
happened
that
on
this
hot
july
day
the
only
sign
of
life
on
the
was
a
small
cloud
of
dust
which
drifted
lazily
in
the
wake
of
two
people
who
passed
along
the
road
on
foot
one
of
the
two
was
a
tired
gaunt
man
in
a
ragged
uniform
of
gray
who
stared
up
the
long
hot
road
ahead
of
him
with
eyes
in
which
there
was
in
spite
of
every
discouragement
the
light
of
a
certain
firm
resolve
the
other
of
the
two
was
a
child
with
bare
brown
legs
and
tattered
gingham
dress
who
limped
painfully
along
beside
the
man
her
sunny
hair
in
a
tangle
half
across
her
pinched
and
weary
little
face
at
a
faint
sigh
of
exhaustion
from
the
child
the
man
looked
down
gathered
her
up
in
his
arms
and
perched
her
on
his
shoulder
then
he
plodded
on
again
a
prey
to
weariness
and
hunger
the
turning
point
in
herbert
cary
life
had
come
thanks
to
a
generous
enemy
virgie
and
he
were
now
reasonably
sure
of
food
if
once
they
could
reach
the
confederate
lines
but
as
for
himself
with
the
woman
he
had
loved
asleep
forever
beneath
the
pines
the
future
could
only
be
an
unending
barren
stretch
of
gray
then
almost
as
quickly
recollection
of
his
duty
towards
her
whom
he
carried
in
his
arms
came
to
him
and
he
raged
at
himself
for
his
moment
of
selfish
discouragement
spurred
on
by
the
necessity
of
gaining
a
point
of
safety
for
his
child
he
began
to
calculate
the
distance
yet
to
be
covered
and
their
chances
of
gaining
friendly
lines
before
encountering
scouting
parties
of
federals
behind
him
a
few
miles
south
on
the
other
bank
of
the
james
at
light
house
point
sheridan
was
in
camp
with
two
brigades
and
cary
knew
this
fast
riding
hard
striking
cavalryman
too
well
not
to
suspect
that
the
country
even
in
front
of
him
was
alive
with
union
men
there
was
the
pass
which
morrison
had
given
him
of
course
but
the
worth
of
a
pass
in
war
time
often
depends
more
on
him
who
receives
it
than
on
the
signature
but
all
those
things
even
food
would
have
to
wait
for
a
while
because
he
was
consumed
with
thirst
and
must
find
water
before
he
went
another
mile
forward
a
tired
sigh
from
virgie
caught
his
ear
and
he
stopped
by
a
stone
wall
and
let
her
get
down
from
his
shoulder
the
child
stood
up
on
the
broad
flat
stones
and
then
gave
a
little
cry
of
pain
she
raised
one
foot
up
and
nursed
it
against
her
dusty
brown
leg
meanwhile
clutching
her
doll
closer
to
her
neck
it
all
right
honey
be
a
brave
little
girl
her
father
said
consolingly
there
a
spring
along
here
somewhere
and
we
can
look
after
that
poor
little
foot
ah
there
it
is
he
cried
as
he
caught
sight
of
a
big
rock
behind
a
stone
wall
with
a
seepage
of
water
under
it
among
some
trees
at
one
side
just
sit
still
a
minute
till
i
rest
and
then
we
have
a
look
he
leaned
back
against
the
wall
and
closed
his
eyes
to
shut
out
the
dizziness
with
which
exhaustion
and
hunger
filled
his
aching
head
the
child
watched
him
anxiously
for
a
moment
and
then
put
a
soft
little
hand
on
his
shoulder
are
you
tired
yes
dear
he
answered
with
a
faint
smile
as
he
opened
his
eyes
i
had
to
catch
my
breath
but
i
really
all
right
now
then
we
call
in
the
hospital
corps
virgie
slipped
down
and
sat
on
the
top
of
the
wall
with
her
foot
in
her
hand
rocking
to
and
fro
but
bravely
saying
nothing
until
her
eye
caught
the
look
of
pain
on
her
pinched
face
does
it
hurt
you
much
dear
he
asked
yes
sir
it
it
hurts
like
the
mischief
answered
virgie
in
a
small
voice
it
keeps
jumping
up
and
down
little
woman
that
too
bad
he
said
with
a
consoling
pat
on
the
head
which
seemed
to
take
most
of
the
pain
away
but
after
we
bathe
it
and
tie
it
up
it
will
feel
better
kneeling
beside
the
spring
he
took
off
his
campaign
hat
of
felt
and
dipped
it
full
of
clear
cold
water
wow
cried
virgie
suddenly
in
the
interval
and
she
slapped
her
leg
with
a
resounding
whack
there
are
roun
this
place
one
of
bit
me
an
old
one
jiminy
did
he
asked
her
father
smiling
as
he
came
back
with
the
hat
well
honey
there
are
much
worse
things
in
this
world
than
those
little
fellows
and
if
you
do
complain
any
more
than
that
you
going
to
be
a
very
happy
lady
when
you
grow
up
like
mamma
asked
the
little
tot
with
a
thoughtful
face
just
like
mamma
the
man
repeated
the
loveliest
the
bravest
and
the
he
wavered
a
little
on
his
feet
and
the
hat
threatened
to
slip
through
his
fingers
but
his
daughter
great
dark
eyes
were
steady
on
his
and
curiously
enough
he
seemed
to
draw
strength
to
pull
himself
together
and
now
let
see
we
have
to
get
the
grime
off
first
just
dip
the
little
wounded
soldier
in
what
my
foot
in
your
hat
protested
virgie
with
a
little
scream
oh
you
poor
daddy
why
that
all
right
honey
he
laughed
pleased
at
her
daintiness
that
hat
an
old
veteran
he
do
mind
anything
so
souse
her
in
there
easy
now
as
she
threatened
to
capsize
this
curious
basin
big
toe
first
yes
i
know
it
cold
he
laughed
as
the
water
stung
the
broken
skin
and
made
her
twitch
involuntarily
but
bathing
will
do
it
good
i
just
know
it
feels
better
already
does
it
yes
sir
answered
virgie
meekly
only
it
jumps
up
and
down
harder
than
ever
but
of
course
i
know
it
must
be
getting
better
good
what
did
i
tell
you
now
let
daddy
look
he
lifted
her
foot
up
tenderly
and
examined
it
with
care
my
my
he
murmured
you
poor
little
soldier
if
i
had
looked
around
that
time
i
expect
you
been
willing
to
walk
all
the
way
to
richmond
on
a
foot
that
would
make
a
whole
regiment
straggle
just
see
where
you
cut
it
right
under
the
second
little
piggie
we
have
to
tie
it
right
up
and
keep
the
bothersome
old
dust
from
getting
in
by
morning
hardly
feel
it
with
a
soldier
readiness
he
opened
his
coat
and
began
to
tear
a
strip
from
his
shirt
from
which
to
make
a
bandage
but
his
small
daughter
interrupted
him
with
a
vigorous
protest
wait
she
cried
with
a
face
full
of
alarm
at
the
willful
destruction
of
his
garment
do
do
that
here
you
can
take
it
off
my
petticoat
petticoat
her
father
laughed
with
the
first
real
mirth
she
had
heard
for
many
weeks
that
poor
little
petticoat
would
make
an
arm
bandage
for
susan
jemima
now
up
with
your
hoofie
and
let
play
i
a
surgeon
and
you
a
brave
soldier
who
has
fought
in
every
battle
since
we
first
made
the
yanks
skedaddle
at
bull
run
with
the
painful
foot
securely
bandaged
the
little
girl
gave
herself
up
to
thought
emerging
from
her
study
at
last
to
ask
what
was
an
question
daddy
yes
do
you
reckon
by
the
time
the
war
is
over
we
could
call
susan
jemima
a
i
should
say
we
could
the
father
agreed
heartily
without
the
symptom
of
a
smile
has
she
grown
bald
in
the
service
and
has
she
almost
lost
an
arm
or
is
it
a
leg
i
see
dangling
so
terribly
i
tell
you
what
we
do
we
give
her
an
honorable
discharge
and
decorate
her
how
that
oh
fine
she
cried
clapping
her
hands
with
delight
at
the
fantasy
and
we
get
that
yankee
man
to
write
her
a
pass
just
like
mine
do
you
hear
that
susan
she
crooned
to
the
doll
unconscious
of
the
convulsion
of
silent
amusement
beside
her
when
we
get
to
richmon
if
we
ever
get
there
i
going
to
make
you
a
uniform
then
she
turned
to
her
father
with
a
little
sigh
for
the
miles
seemed
very
long
how
far
it
to
richmon
she
said
just
about
twelve
miles
her
father
answered
but
they
real
old
country
miles
i
sorry
to
say
can
we
get
to
it
the
simple
little
question
made
the
man
heart
ache
what
would
he
give
for
an
hour
of
roger
once
more
or
belle
or
lightfoot
anything
even
one
of
the
old
plantation
mules
would
do
if
he
could
only
perch
her
up
on
its
back
and
take
her
into
richmond
like
a
lady
and
not
like
the
daughter
of
poor
white
trash
tramping
poverty
stricken
along
a
dusty
road
no
dear
not
he
sighed
we
come
a
long
way
and
both
tired
so
when
it
gets
dark
we
curl
up
somewhere
in
the
nice
sweet
woods
and
take
a
snooze
just
like
camping
out
and
then
in
the
morning
when
the
old
sun
comes
sneaking
up
through
the
trees
fool
him
we
wo
wait
till
he
can
make
it
hot
but
we
get
right
up
with
the
birds
and
the
squirrels
and
we
just
run
right
along
and
by
twelve
we
be
in
richmond
where
they
have
good
things
to
eat
so
there
you
are
all
mapped
out
only
now
we
have
a
belt
supper
a
belt
supper
queried
the
child
curiously
though
her
face
brightened
at
the
thought
of
kind
of
supper
made
out
of
belts
or
any
other
thing
asseverated
her
father
gravely
see
this
is
the
way
done
he
cupped
his
hands
and
took
a
draught
from
the
spring
pretending
to
chew
it
as
it
went
down
you
take
a
big
drink
of
nice
cold
water
then
draw
up
your
belt
as
tight
as
you
can
and
say
your
prayers
to
his
surprise
his
small
daughter
only
sniffed
scornfully
oh
shucks
daddy
i
know
a
better
way
than
that
susan
an
me
used
to
do
it
all
the
time
while
you
were
away
what
did
you
do
he
asked
curiously
for
he
had
forgotten
that
more
than
half
the
childish
play
world
is
the
world
of
make
believe
why
we
we
just
she
answered
with
simple
naïveté
sit
down
an
i
show
you
how
he
sat
down
obediently
but
not
before
he
had
picked
up
an
old
tin
can
from
nearby
and
set
it
carefully
between
them
this
rock
is
our
table
the
moss
is
the
table
cloth
oh
it
green
she
cried
as
he
looked
down
in
serious
doubt
you
must
me
make
believe
now
does
it
look
nice
and
white
it
does
indeed
i
can
see
nothing
but
snowy
linen
of
the
finest
texture
he
responded
instantly
that
better
complimented
his
hostess
and
then
with
a
grand
air
i
so
glad
you
dropped
in
sir
an
just
at
supper
time
pass
your
plate
an
allow
me
to
help
you
to
some
batter
bread
batter
bread
ah
just
what
i
was
hoping
for
her
guest
replied
thankfully
extending
his
plate
for
the
imaginary
feast
thank
you
delicious
the
very
best
i
tasted
for
a
year
did
you
make
it
yourself
oh
dear
no
the
cook
ah
of
course
pray
pardon
me
i
might
have
known
the
little
hostess
inclined
her
head
take
plenty
of
butter
batter
bread
is
good
butter
thank
you
what
lovely
golden
butter
and
goodness
gracious
what
is
this
i
see
before
me
can
this
really
be
a
sausage
yes
sir
laughed
virgie
with
delight
and
there
the
ham
i
smoked
it
myself
over
wood
please
help
yourself
she
pretended
to
arrange
a
cup
and
saucer
in
front
of
her
and
held
daintily
in
her
fingers
a
pair
of
imaginary
sugar
tongs
coffee
how
many
lumps
and
you
take
cream
five
please
and
a
little
cream
there
just
right
she
passed
the
cup
gracefully
and
added
a
little
moue
of
concern
for
the
efficiency
of
her
ménage
i
afraid
you
wo
find
it
very
hot
said
this
surprising
young
hostess
that
butler
of
mine
is
growing
absolutely
then
perhaps
we
can
have
something
better
her
guest
responded
readily
and
he
picked
up
the
battered
old
tin
can
permit
me
miss
cary
to
offer
you
a
glass
of
fine
old
blackberry
wine
which
i
carefully
brought
with
me
to
your
beautiful
home
it
has
been
in
my
family
wine
cellars
since
well
he
cried
as
virgie
suddenly
sat
back
with
a
look
of
painful
recollection
on
her
face
oh
daddy
she
murmured
pathetically
let
call
it
wine
forgive
me
darling
her
father
said
tenderly
and
he
took
the
small
face
between
his
hands
and
kissed
her
there
now
it
all
right
to
create
a
diversion
he
looked
behind
him
with
a
frown
and
spoke
with
great
severity
to
an
imaginary
waiter
here
how
dare
you
bring
such
terribly
reminiscent
stuff
to
our
table
go
get
the
port
we
surely
have
to
discharge
that
butler
he
said
he
too
shiftless
and
now
fair
lady
will
you
honor
me
by
joining
the
humblest
of
your
admirers
in
a
sip
of
port
with
pleasure
answered
his
hostess
and
lifted
the
can
of
water
in
both
hands
your
health
sir
may
your
shadow
never
grow
littler
half
way
through
her
drink
virgie
stopped
and
slowly
put
the
can
down
she
looked
at
her
father
who
already
had
his
finger
at
his
lips
voices
had
come
to
them
from
down
the
road
the
sounds
of
a
party
of
men
talking
and
laughing
as
they
marched
along
cary
face
took
on
again
the
grim
lines
which
had
been
wiped
away
momentarily
by
their
little
bit
of
play
he
was
trying
to
make
himself
believe
that
the
approaching
party
might
be
friends
although
he
knew
only
too
well
that
such
a
possibility
was
full
of
doubt
there
were
too
many
scouting
parties
of
federals
ready
to
pounce
on
rebel
patrols
in
these
perilous
days
to
allow
any
but
large
forces
of
men
to
venture
far
from
richmond
and
when
his
own
men
sallied
forth
they
did
not
go
with
laughter
but
with
tightly
drawn
silent
lips
he
whispered
and
held
up
his
finger
again
as
she
seemed
ready
to
burst
into
questioning
immediately
she
snuggled
close
to
him
and
whispered
hotly
in
his
ear
who
are
they
daddy
i
do
know
honey
he
whispered
back
but
i
afraid
they
yanks
keep
quiet
till
they
pass
and
quickly
deserting
the
stone
under
the
trees
where
they
had
had
their
belt
supper
he
drew
her
with
him
behind
the
large
ledge
of
rock
from
under
which
the
spring
flowed
out
looking
behind
them
he
saw
that
with
good
luck
they
could
reach
the
shelter
of
the
woods
and
get
up
over
the
hill
without
being
seen
but
just
now
they
could
not
stir
from
their
hiding
place
unless
unless
the
men
were
confederates
this
faint
hope
however
soon
flickered
out
when
he
saw
the
color
of
their
uniforms
up
the
road
came
four
dismounted
men
with
a
corporal
in
command
they
were
taking
it
easy
as
they
walked
along
their
caps
thrust
back
their
coats
open
and
their
sharps
carbines
carried
in
the
variety
of
ways
that
a
soldier
adopts
to
ease
his
shoulder
of
the
burden
that
grows
heavier
with
every
mile
here
the
place
boys
the
corporal
called
out
as
his
eye
fell
on
the
spring
we
can
get
some
decent
water
now
that
james
river
water
too
yellow
for
any
white
man
to
put
inside
of
him
at
the
sound
of
a
voice
which
he
had
heard
that
same
morning
while
he
hid
in
the
attic
of
the
overseer
cabin
cary
hold
on
his
hand
tightened
warningly
come
along
virgie
he
whispered
we
get
out
of
the
way
but
daddy
she
protested
in
low
tones
we
got
our
pass
yes
yes
i
know
he
answered
with
a
twinge
of
regret
that
the
rest
of
the
world
could
not
trust
so
faithfully
to
human
kindness
but
that
for
emergency
come
along
honey
quick
silently
as
a
shadow
the
two
stole
out
of
the
shelter
of
the
ledge
of
rock
and
by
dint
of
keeping
it
between
them
and
the
troopers
managed
to
cover
most
of
the
open
space
between
the
spring
and
the
protecting
trees
without
being
seen
meanwhile
they
heard
the
corporal
giving
his
commands
you
collins
take
sentry
duty
out
there
in
the
road
for
a
while
as
soon
as
we
make
the
coffee
we
bring
you
out
a
cup
now
over
the
wall
with
you
men
leaving
one
man
behind
to
pace
slowly
up
and
down
the
dusty
road
the
four
sprang
over
the
wall
and
advanced
towards
the
spring
it
was
well
the
sight
of
the
cool
water
held
their
eyes
for
if
they
had
only
looked
up
they
might
have
seen
virgie
wresting
her
hand
out
of
her
grasp
and
standing
suddenly
petrified
with
the
thought
that
she
had
left
behind
her
one
beloved
possession
here
the
spring
smith
under
the
rock
fill
up
the
canteens
here
harry
help
me
get
fire
wood
with
a
soldier
readiness
when
it
comes
to
making
camp
one
of
the
troopers
promptly
collected
the
canteens
and
knelt
down
by
the
spring
carefully
submerging
one
at
a
time
so
as
to
get
the
sweet
cold
water
in
all
its
purity
another
opened
the
knapsacks
and
took
out
a
can
of
coffee
biscuits
and
some
scraps
of
meat
not
much
with
which
to
make
a
meal
but
still
so
much
more
than
many
a
rebel
soldier
had
that
day
as
to
take
on
the
proportions
of
a
feast
meanwhile
corporal
dudley
had
drawn
his
saber
and
was
engaged
in
leisurely
lopping
off
the
dead
branches
of
a
fallen
tree
this
strikes
me
a
lot
better
than
the
camp
he
remarked
as
he
tossed
his
firewood
into
a
heap
a
man
and
his
friends
can
have
a
quiet
drink
here
without
treating
a
whole
battalion
his
eye
fell
on
the
ground
near
the
spring
as
he
spoke
and
he
paused
then
with
a
grin
on
his
face
he
jabbed
his
saber
into
something
which
lay
there
and
held
it
transfixed
on
the
point
say
boys
look
at
this
and
he
shook
poor
susan
jemima
till
her
arms
and
legs
wiggled
spasmodically
and
her
dress
seemed
on
the
point
of
complete
disintegration
perhaps
if
corporal
dudley
had
not
laughed
derisively
virgie
might
have
stayed
hidden
in
the
protection
of
the
trees
but
this
outrageous
insult
combined
with
the
terrible
sight
of
poor
susan
jemima
impaled
on
a
yankee
sword
was
too
much
for
her
bursting
heart
with
blazing
eyes
she
broke
away
from
her
father
and
dashed
back
to
the
group
at
the
spring
here
you
you
stop
that
she
cried
angrily
at
the
astonished
troopers
who
caught
up
their
carbines
at
the
sound
of
feet
dare
you
there
was
a
moment
of
surprise
and
then
the
four
broke
out
in
guffaws
of
laughter
well
hang
me
if
it
is
the
little
girl
we
saw
this
morning
shouted
dudley
without
however
stopping
the
torture
of
the
defenseless
susan
jemima
where
did
drop
from
ne
min
where
i
dropped
from
commanded
the
wrathful
virgie
with
her
dark
eyes
like
twin
stars
of
hate
you
the
meanest
old
thing
i
ever
saw
me
back
my
baby
back
in
the
trees
a
little
way
a
man
was
watching
with
a
heavy
heart
he
knew
only
too
well
what
was
to
come
no
matter
what
the
final
outcome
might
be
when
he
showed
his
to
his
own
army
lines
there
would
be
a
delay
and
searching
questions
and
more
of
the
old
insults
which
always
made
his
blood
boil
which
always
made
the
increasing
burden
of
despair
still
harder
to
bear
but
there
was
no
use
in
putting
off
the
trial
virgie
had
slipped
away
in
spite
of
every
whispered
remonstrance
and
now
that
she
was
there
in
the
center
of
that
group
of
guffawing
yankees
there
too
was
the
only
place
for
him
and
so
he
stepped
out
swiftly
and
faced
the
enemy
hah
shouted
dudley
looking
up
at
the
sound
of
branches
crackling
underfoot
a
johnnie
reb
eh
walking
right
into
camp
that
right
harry
keep
him
covered
he
looked
cary
over
from
head
to
foot
with
a
sneer
at
his
tattered
uniform
well
sir
he
asked
who
are
you
a
confederate
officer
was
the
quiet
reply
acting
as
escort
for
this
child
we
are
on
our
way
to
richmond
cary
hand
went
into
the
breast
of
his
coat
and
he
drew
out
a
folded
paper
here
is
my
authority
for
entering
your
lines
a
pass
signed
by
morrison
at
the
sound
of
the
name
corporal
dudley
started
and
quickly
took
the
paper
but
before
he
opened
it
he
gave
cary
a
keen
look
which
to
the
confederate
officer
did
not
bode
well
for
the
prospect
of
immediate
release
it
seemed
as
if
the
man
sharp
wits
had
suddenly
seized
on
something
which
he
could
profitably
turn
to
his
own
account
with
his
back
turned
on
cary
and
virgie
the
corporal
unfolded
the
pass
and
studied
it
carefully
while
the
troopers
gathered
behind
him
and
tried
to
read
its
contents
over
his
shoulder
pwhat
does
it
say
asked
the
young
irishman
harry
who
had
covered
cary
with
his
carbine
is
a
precious
bit
of
paper
bedad
if
it
passes
him
through
it
says
virginia
cary
and
escort
through
all
federal
lines
and
assist
them
as
far
as
possible
in
reaching
richmond
read
the
corporal
deep
in
thought
he
turned
the
paper
over
and
studied
the
name
on
the
back
at
the
sight
of
the
signature
there
his
mouth
fell
open
and
he
uttered
a
shout
of
surprise
his
eyes
brightened
and
he
stepped
back
from
the
group
and
threw
up
his
head
with
a
look
of
triumph
on
his
dark
face
he
struck
the
paper
a
slap
with
the
back
of
his
hand
morrison
on
side
and
bob
on
the
he
exclaimed
what
luck
what
a
how
so
a
find
the
man
who
had
had
to
put
his
own
brother
under
arrest
a
few
short
weeks
before
and
then
had
seen
him
shot
through
the
heart
by
this
same
officer
whose
name
was
on
the
pass
looked
at
the
questioner
with
an
ugly
glitter
in
his
eyes
he
was
beginning
to
taste
already
the
sweets
of
revenge
for
blood
ties
bind
no
matter
how
badly
they
are
stretched
and
long
ago
corporal
dudley
had
sworn
to
wipe
out
his
grudge
why
man
ca
you
see
he
whispered
excitedly
this
johnnie
reb
is
the
man
that
was
hiding
in
the
cabin
loft
this
morning
morrison
lied
when
he
said
he
was
there
you
remember
he
was
the
only
one
who
looked
he
lied
and
as
soon
as
he
got
us
out
of
the
way
he
let
him
come
down
and
he
gave
him
could
any
man
ask
for
better
proof
that
we
had
the
spy
right
in
our
hands
and
then
our
commanding
officer
deliberately
let
him
go
at
the
sound
of
the
man
excited
whispering
cary
fears
as
to
the
value
of
virgie
pass
grew
too
strong
to
warrant
this
agony
of
watching
and
waiting
and
he
stepped
forward
with
a
sharp
question
well
corporal
is
the
pass
satisfactory
oh
perfectly
perfectly
dudley
answered
with
baleful
readiness
but
made
no
move
to
return
it
cary
put
out
his
hand
then
i
would
like
to
have
it
again
if
you
please
by
way
of
answer
corporal
dudley
carefully
found
an
inside
pocket
and
buttoned
the
pass
up
in
his
coat
oh
no
you
do
he
said
with
an
evil
grin
i
got
a
better
use
for
that
little
piece
of
paper
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
you
my
prisoner
mister
johnnie
reb
was
the
brutal
answer
for
what
asked
cary
while
his
heart
grew
sick
inside
him
and
his
lips
twitched
richmond
and
food
for
virgie
were
growing
farther
away
every
moment
because
you
a
rebel
that
why
came
the
biting
answer
oh
none
of
that
as
cary
fists
doubled
up
and
he
made
a
forward
step
at
the
corporal
i
guess
you
know
what
good
for
you
with
three
guns
at
your
back
if
colonel
morrison
would
take
you
as
a
spy
will
here
boys
he
said
in
brusque
command
to
his
men
we
have
to
cut
the
supper
and
take
this
man
to
camp
there
be
a
sunrise
hanging
or
i
miss
my
guess
come
on
now
bring
him
along
wait
a
minute
corporal
said
sure
i
something
to
say
to
ye
and
he
led
him
aside
where
the
others
could
not
bear
all
unconscious
of
the
fatal
predicament
into
which
susan
jemima
and
she
had
got
them
virgie
looked
up
at
her
father
from
where
she
stood
in
the
shelter
of
his
arm
daddy
she
questioned
in
a
small
puzzled
voice
what
are
they
going
to
do
her
father
commanded
as
he
patted
her
head
comfortingly
everything
will
be
all
right
honey
i
sure
but
he
had
caught
enough
of
the
corporal
altercation
with
trooper
to
make
him
see
that
things
were
very
far
from
being
what
he
wanted
virgie
to
suppose
ye
better
be
careful
now
said
to
dudley
ye
know
well
that
if
the
pass
is
all
right
ye
be
getting
yerself
into
a
peck
trouble
it
is
that
get
in
trouble
dudley
answered
with
grim
triumph
it
someone
else
faith
then
was
the
query
snapped
dudley
with
an
ominous
click
of
his
teeth
the
colonel
why
he
helped
this
spy
escape
that
why
he
killed
my
brother
shot
him
shot
him
down
like
a
dog
but
now
i
even
with
him
he
shook
the
pass
under
the
trooper
nose
and
crowed
with
satisfaction
i
been
waiting
for
a
chance
like
this
he
chortled
and
now
going
to
make
him
sweat
sweat
blood
do
be
a
fool
corporal
the
trooper
counseled
what
ye
be
after
doin
him
at
for
helping
a
spy
escape
if
i
have
the
man
and
and
he
slapped
the
paper
it
mean
his
sword
and
shoulder
straps
if
not
a
bullet
come
on
he
turned
away
to
scramble
over
the
wall
but
trooper
caught
his
arm
hold
on
ye
may
get
in
trouble
in
answer
dudley
broke
away
and
doggedly
kept
on
towards
the
stone
wall
and
the
road
keep
off
he
snarled
running
this
i
know
ye
are
the
trooper
replied
but
wait
and
he
pointed
to
the
rear
do
forgit
that
the
colonel
out
yonder
reconnoiterin
if
he
happened
to
overtake
ye
on
the
road
struck
with
the
sudden
thought
dudley
paused
well
that
so
he
growled
as
he
saw
how
easily
he
could
be
held
for
disobeying
orders
and
how
quickly
all
his
plans
for
vengeance
could
be
smashed
he
stood
still
for
a
moment
gnawing
his
lip
then
suddenly
struck
his
doubled
fist
into
the
palm
of
the
other
hand
then
you
stay
here
to
guard
the
prisoner
he
said
i
cut
through
the
woods
make
my
report
come
back
with
the
horses
and
my
authority
here
smith
you
and
judson
come
along
with
me
never
mind
the
grub
we
get
that
later
turning
to
if
you
hear
anyone
coming
take
those
two
into
the
woods
collins
you
have
to
stay
on
sentry
duty
till
i
get
back
if
any
troops
pass
here
get
out
of
sight
at
once
and
give
harry
warning
now
boys
come
along
with
me
we
take
it
on
the
trot
and
climbing
quickly
over
the
wall
the
man
who
held
two
lives
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
ran
down
the
road
with
the
two
troopers
finally
cutting
over
into
the
woods
and
disappearing
from
view
gary
and
virgie
stood
still
by
the
spring
out
in
the
road
the
sentry
paced
back
and
forth
behind
them
trooper
stood
on
guard
his
carbine
in
his
arms
across
his
breast
virgie
pulled
gently
at
her
father
hand
daddy
she
whispered
are
they
are
they
goin
to
carry
us
off
to
the
yankee
camp
i
afraid
so
darling
but
i
do
know
he
answered
sadly
just
have
to
wait
wait
he
repeated
as
he
sat
down
on
a
rock
and
drew
her
close
to
him
without
being
seen
either
by
virgie
or
he
picked
up
a
jagged
stone
the
size
of
his
fist
and
hid
it
under
his
knee
against
the
rock
it
would
be
a
poor
weapon
at
best
but
cary
had
grown
desperate
and
if
the
trooper
once
turned
his
back
and
gave
him
opportunity
poor
harry
would
wake
up
with
a
very
bad
headache
and
virgie
would
be
in
richmond
but
virgie
eyes
were
on
neither
the
hidden
stone
nor
her
watchful
relentless
face
all
that
virgie
could
see
was
a
knapsack
open
on
the
ground
and
food
real
food
displayed
round
about
with
a
prodigality
which
made
her
mouth
water
and
her
eyes
as
big
as
saucers
daddy
she
murmured
clutching
at
his
sleeve
while
we
are
waitin
do
you
reckon
we
could
take
just
a
bit
of
that
no
dear
not
now
her
father
answered
with
a
touch
of
impatience
it
would
be
too
much
even
in
those
bitter
times
to
accept
a
man
food
and
then
break
his
head
for
it
well
said
virgie
completely
mystified
at
the
restraint
i
do
see
why
they
should
be
polite
to
us
we
were
just
as
polite
as
could
be
when
the
yankees
took
our
corn
just
then
the
young
irishman
with
the
carbine
turned
around
and
caught
the
wan
look
on
virgie
face
and
the
hunger
appeal
in
her
big
dark
eyes
at
once
a
broad
smile
broke
over
his
freckled
countenance
and
he
gestured
hospitably
with
his
gun
have
somethin
to
eat
little
wan
cary
knee
loosened
the
jagged
stone
fell
to
the
ground

fellow
he
cried
springing
to
his
feet
i
ca
show
my
gratitude
to
you
in
any
substantial
way
at
present
but
god
bless
you
just
the
same
he
dropped
down
on
the
rock
again
and
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
another
moment
and
the
kindhearted
trooper
might
have
been
lying
face
downwards
in
the
muddy
ground
around
the
spring
it
had
been
only
but
the
man
warm
irish
heart
had
saved
him
oh

all

answered
freely

like

though

ai
the
gineral

he
grinned
there

went
on
pushing
the
knapsack
over
towards
virgie
with
the
muzzle
of
his
carbine
jist
help
yerself
give
yer
dad
some
too
with
a
little
cry
of
delight
virgie
swooped
down
on
the
knapsack
and
explored
its
interior
with
eager
hands
i
much
obliged
yankee
we
do
need
it
bad
she
tossed
the
tangled
hair
back
from
her
eyes
and
looked
thankfully
up
at
this
curious
person
who
had
so
much
food
that
he
could
really
give
part
of
it
away
please
yankee
wo
you
tell
me
your
name
harry
at
your
service
miss
thank
you
she
bowed
i
very
glad
to
meet
you
then
her
searching
hands
found
something
wonderful
in
the
knapsack
and
she
sprang
up
and
ran
with
her
prizes
to
her
father
look
daddy
biscuits
take
one
it
it
cary
eyes
grew
moist
thank
you
darling
thank
you
just
now
the
lump
in
his
throat
would
not
have
allowed
him
to
eat
soup
let
alone
a
rather
hard
biscuit
but
he
looked
up
with
a
laugh
and
waved
a
genial
salute
to
the
trooper
who
as
genially
responded
virgie
however
had
become
quite
single
minded
since
she
had
discovered
food
and
with
a
happy
sigh
she
raised
the
biscuit
to
her
lips
just
then
the
sentry
in
the
road
flung
up
his
hand
with
a
shout
look
out
they
coming
and
he
clambered
quickly
over
the
wall
and
dropped
behind
it
his
gun
in
readiness
what
is
it
demanded
the
other
trooper
detachment
of
cavalry
a
small
one
but
whose
is
it
man
can
ye
not
see
collins
holding
his
hand
behind
him
in
a
gesture
which
commanded
them
to
stay
where
they
were
raised
his
head
cautiously
over
the
wall
morrison
he
answered
after
a
quick
look
and
he
dropped
down
again
out
of
sight
at
the
sound
of
hoof
beats
and
the
name
she
remembered
so
well
virgie
with
her
biscuit
all
untasted
sprang
up
from
the
ground
as
if
she
would
run
out
on
the
road
but
her
father
caught
her
for
had
turned
to
them
with
a
serious
face
i
sorry
sir
but
i
have
to
trouble
ye
to
get
under
cover
in
the
woods
no
argymint
sir
he
said
decisively
as
he
saw
some
show
of
resistance
on
cary
part
i
under
orders
yes
yes
i
know
cary
cried
impatiently
but
i
want
to
speak
to
colonel
morrison
i
speak
to
him
give
me
a
moment
man
you
wo
ever
regret
it
come
now
none
o
that
commanded
the
trooper
pushing
him
back
with
the
carbine
across
his
breast
do
make
me
use
force
sir
ye
have
to
go
so
go
quietly
and
mind
no
shenanigan
cary
stood
his
ground
for
a
moment
meeting
the
trooper
eye
to
eye
then
turned
with
hanging
head
and
walked
a
few
steps
back
into
the
woods
come
virgie
he
said
i
guess
we
wo
get
to
see
colonel
morrison
after
all
but
virgie
being
a
woman
had
her
own
ideas
about
what
she
would
or
would
not
do
at
the
same
moment
that
the
trooper
was
forcing
her
father
step
by
step
back
into
the
woods
virgie
was
running
madly
towards
the
stone
wall
and
before
either
of
the
soldiers
could
stop
her
she
had
clambered
up
on
its
broad
top
and
was
calling
out
to
a
man
who
clattered
by
at
the
head
of
a
troop
of
cavalry
colonel
morrison
colonel
morrison
chapter
viii
halt
at
the
sound
of
that
piping
childish
treble
calling
his
name
in
so
unexpected
a
place
the
officer
at
the
head
of
the
troop
threw
up
his
gauntleted
hand
and
brought
the
detachment
to
a
standstill
in
a
cloud
of
dust
hello
there
he
said
turning
curiously
around
in
his
saddle
who
is
it
wants
me
it
virgie
the
child
cried
leaping
up
and
down
on
the
wall
all
forgetful
of
her
sore
foot
come
help
daddy
and
me
come
quick
well
what
on
earth
morrison
threw
out
a
command
to
his
men
and
wheeling
his
horse
spurred
vigorously
up
to
the
wall
where
he
dismounted
and
came
up
to
take
a
closer
view
of
the
tangle
haired
little
person
dancing
on
one
foot
why
bless
my
soul
if
it
is
virgie
his
arms
opened
to
take
her
in
when
suddenly
his
eye
fell
on
standing
at
attention
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
he
said
sternly
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
why
you
with
your
detachment
it
is
fault
virgie
interposed
in
stout
defense
of
the
nice
yankee
who
carried
biscuits
in
his
knapsack
he
under
orders
the
glib
use
of
the
military
term
made
a
smile
flicker
across
face
but
his
eyes
did
not
leave
the
troubled
trooper
orders
he
demanded
corporal
dudley
sir
was
the
stammering
answer
at
this
moment
cary
stepped
forward
and
the
two
officers
exchanged
nods
of
recognition
let
me
explain
the
confederate
said
virgie
and
i
were
making
for
richmond
as
rapidly
as
we
could
here
by
this
spring
we
were
put
under
arrest
by
a
corporal
and
four
troopers
naturally
i
presented
your
pass
but
the
corporal
refused
to
honor
it
he
then
left
me
under
guard
and
hurried
off
to
headquarters
with
the
pass
in
his
possession
at
this
unwelcome
news
morrison
head
jerked
back
as
if
he
had
been
struck
and
his
lips
tightened
without
the
addition
of
another
word
to
cary
story
he
saw
all
the
dire
consequences
to
himself
of
what
had
been
an
act
of
the
commonest
humanity
yes
in
other
times
it
would
have
been
what
any
right
thinking
human
being
would
have
done
for
another
in
distress
but
unhappily
this
was
war
time
and
the
best
of
motives
were
only
too
often
in
his
mind
eye
he
saw
the
vindictive
dudley
eager
for
a
revenge
which
he
could
not
encompass
any
other
way
laying
the
proof
of
this
act
before
his
superiors
with
an
abundance
of
collateral
evidence
which
he
knew
would
condemn
him
before
any
military
tribunal
in
the
world
it
mattered
not
what
kindly
impulses
had
guided
his
hand
when
he
wrote
the
safeguard
on
the
other
side
of
the
paper
on
which
robert
lee
had
previously
placed
his
name
for
it
is
not
the
custom
of
courts
martial
to
weigh
the
milk
of
human
kindness
against
the
blood
and
iron
of
war
the
good
and
the
safety
of
the
greater
number
demand
the
sacrifice
of
every
man
who
would
imperil
the
cause
by
ill
considered
generosity
morrison
could
see
that
very
presently
he
would
have
to
answer
certain
stern
questions
yet
there
was
a
chance
still
that
dudley
might
be
headed
off
and
this
whole
miserable
business
stopped
before
revenge
could
set
the
inexorable
wheels
in
motion
and
he
whirled
round
on
with
a
sharp
question
which
way
did
dudley
go
down
the
pike
then
over
the
hill
by
the
wood
road
sor
makin
for
headquarters
the
young
irishman
answered
only
too
glad
of
a
chance
to
help
his
officer
out
of
what
he
saw
was
a
frightful
situation
how
long
ago
came
back
the
instant
query
five
minutes
sor
ye
cud
catch
him
wid
a
horse
ah
exclaimed
morrison
and
he
threw
up
his
hand
to
his
men
lieutenant
harris
he
shouted
take
a
squad
and
ride
to
camp
by
the
wood
road
overtake
corporal
dudley
or
intercept
him
at
headquarters
do
fail
get
him
and
bring
him
here
lieutenant
harris
hand
went
up
to
his
hat
in
ready
salute
and
he
bellowed
out
his
orders
jennings
hewlett
brown
hammond
burt
face
forward
almost
before
the
words
were
out
of
his
mouth
harris
and
his
men
were
riding
madly
down
the
road
in
a
chase
which
the
lieutenant
suspected
meant
something
more
to
his
colonel
than
merely
the
recovery
of
a
for
a
confederate
officer
and
a
little
girl
morrison
turned
to
trooper
and
jerked
his
thumb
towards
the
road
report
at
my
quarters
this
evening
at
nine
he
said
curtly
and
the
young
irishman
thankful
to
be
well
out
of
the
mess
quickly
clambered
over
the
wall
and
disappeared
though
not
without
a
soft
voiced
farewell
from
virgie
knapsack
man
called
the
child
thank
you
for
the
biscuits
then
cary
came
forward
and
gripped
the
other
hand
colonel
he
said
earnestly
with
full
appreciation
of
what
was
passing
through
morrison
mind
i
hope
no
trouble
will
come
of
this
if
i
had
only
known
the
vindictiveness
of
this
man
he
was
interrupted
by
a
genially
objecting
hand
and
a
laugh
which
morrison
was
somehow
able
to
make
lighthearted
oh
that
will
be
all
right
harris
will
get
him
never
fear
and
so
he
said
addressing
miss
virginia
that
bad
man
took
your
pass
yes
sir
he
did
virgie
answered
and
caught
his
hand
in
hers
he
ran
right
away
with
it
mean
old
thing
well
then
we
have
to
write
you
out
another
one
a
nice
clean
white
one
this
time
come
on
little
sweetheart
we
do
it
together
and
he
took
out
a
note
book
and
pencil
i
say
morrison
cary
murmured
glancing
apprehensively
at
the
troopers
idling
in
the
road
and
very
plainly
interested
in
what
the
small
group
were
doing
do
you
really
think
you
better
on
your
own
account
again
morrison
hand
was
raised
in
polite
objection
he
had
taken
a
sporting
chance
when
he
wrote
the
pass
which
had
been
stolen
but
because
he
had
probably
lost
was
no
reason
why
he
should
play
the
game
out
bravely
to
the
end
so
he
only
smiled
at
virgie
who
came
and
sat
beside
him
and
began
to
write
the
few
short
sentences
of
his
second
but
while
he
wrote
he
was
talking
in
low
tones
which
the
troopers
in
the
road
could
not
hear
there
a
line
of
your
pickets
about
three
miles
up
the
road
cary
said
he
if
i
loaned
you
a
horse
do
you
think
virgie
could
ride
behind
you
pouted
virgie
why
daddy
says
that
when
i
was
bornded
i
came
ridin
in
on
a
stork
morrison
burst
out
laughing
and
dropped
his
hand
down
on
the
small
paw
resting
on
his
knee
then
by
george
and
the
dragon
we
send
you
home
to
jefferson
davis
on
a
snorting
pegasus
again
cary
spoke
to
him
in
warning
tones
which
at
the
same
time
thanked
him
unendingly
for
the
kindly
thought
you
need
trouble
about
the
mount
why
man
he
said
huskily
you
in
trouble
enough
as
it
is
and
if
our
lines
are
as
close
as
you
say
they
are
once
more
the
union
officer
checked
him
it
is
any
trouble
only
you
have
to
be
careful
of
your
approach
even
to
your
own
lines
those
gray
devils
in
the
rifle
pits
up
there
have
formed
the
habit
of
shooting
and
asking
questions
there
you
are
and
he
tore
the
leaf
from
his
note
book
and
handed
it
up
with
a
faint
smile
the
southerner
took
it
with
a
reluctant
hand
i
i
wish
i
could
thank
you
morrison
he
said
in
tones
that
shook
with
feeling
but
you
see
i
i
then
please
do
try
because
if
you
do
i
i
have
to
hold
virgie
as
a
prisoner
of
war
well
young
one
he
said
to
the
small
miss
cary
with
a
laugh
did
you
really
get
something
to
eat
yes
sir
that
is
we
did
he
echoed
yes
sir
came
the
plaintive
answer
time
we
start
to
eat
somethin
happens
well
well
that
hard
luck
he
said
with
a
gentle
squeeze
of
her
frail
body
but
i
bet
you
it
wo
happen
this
time
not
if
a
whole
regiment
tries
to
stop
it
come
on
he
suggested
as
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
began
picking
up
dry
twigs
you
can
start
in
and
munch
on
those
heavenly
biscuits
while
this
terrible
yankee
builds
the
fire
cary
made
a
move
as
if
to
help
but
morrison
checked
him
oh
no
cary
just
you
keep
on
sitting
still
this
is
no
work
for
you
you
tired
out
here
virgie
i
know
you
want
to
get
me
some
water
from
the
spring
please
pick
out
the
cleanest
pieces
of
water
you
can
and
put
them
carefully
in
the
coffee
pot
all
right
there
you
are
coffee
pot
right
wheel
with
a
carefree
laugh
he
turned
away
to
light
the
little
heap
of
twigs
he
had
placed
between
two
flat
stones
it
mighty
considerate
of
my
boys
to
leave
us
all
these
things
we
call
it
the
raid
of
black
gum
spring
and
here
comes
the
little
lady
with
the
coffee
pot
filled
just
right
now
watch
me
pour
in
the
good
old
coffee
coffee
virgie
dear
not
made
from
he
settled
the
pot
on
the
fire
and
sat
back
with
a
grin
oh
oh
do
watch
it
he
cried
in
well
feigned
alarm
as
virgie
unwilling
to
believe
the
sight
stooped
over
to
feast
her
eyes
on
the
rich
brown
powder
sinking
into
the
black
gulf
of
the
pot
if
you
do
that
it
will
never
boil
all
right
the
child
agreed
pathetically
and
she
sank
wearily
down
against
her
father
knee
i
just
pray
for
it
to
hurry
up
the
two
men
exchanged
quiet
smiles
and
cary
murmured
something
in
his
daughter
ear
oh
no
i
wo
she
answered
and
then
looked
up
at
morrison
with
a
roguish
light
in
her
dark
eyes
he
only
afraid
i
pray
so
terribly
hard
that
the
old
coffee
pot
will
boil
over
an
put
out
the
fire
morrison
chuckling
now
began
to
drag
something
out
of
a
rear
pocket
presently
he
uncorked
it
and
held
it
up
a
here
cary
he
said
holding
out
a
cup
join
me
wo
you
of
course
you
understand
in
case
a
snake
should
bite
us
colonel
morrison
responded
the
southerner
you
are
certainly
a
man
of
ideas
he
waited
for
his
foe
to
fill
his
own
cup
then
raised
his
in
a
toast
i
drink
to
the
health
sir
of
you
and
yours
here
hoping
that
some
day
i
may
take
prisoner
at
the
quizzical
look
of
surprise
in
the
other
face
cary
voice
almost
broke
i
mean
sir
it
the
only
way
i
could
ever
hope
to
show
you
how
much
i
appreciate
he
stopped
and
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
not
a
little
to
his
daughter
alarm
come
come
old
chap
the
northerner
said
bluffly
tapping
him
on
the
shoulder
brace
up
it
the
fortunes
of
war
you
know
one
side
or
the
other
is
bound
to
win
perhaps
who
knows
it
may
be
turn
well
sir
here
goes
may
it
soon
be
over
in
the
way
best
and
wisest
for
us
all
now
virgie
he
went
on
when
the
toast
had
been
drunk
while
i
wash
these
cups
suppose
you
go
on
another
voyage
of
discovery
through
the
magic
knapsack
for
some
sugar
for
the
coffee
he
watched
her
fling
herself
impetuously
on
the
knapsack
if
you
find
any
yankee
spoons
put
them
under
arrest
they
have
any
pass
like
yours
then
he
turned
to
cary
have
any
trouble
on
the
road
as
you
came
along
the
other
man
shook
his
head
none
to
speak
of
we
were
stopped
several
times
of
course
but
each
time
your
pass
let
us
through
without
delay
until
we
met
dudley
and
now
i
worried
colonel
he
said
frankly
while
his
eyes
tried
to
tell
the
other
all
that
he
feared
without
putting
it
in
words
worried
on
your
account
it
easy
to
see
that
the
man
has
a
grudge
against
you
yes
i
afraid
he
has
was
the
thoughtful
reply
but
really
cary
you
must
try
to
carry
any
more
burdens
than
your
own
just
now
i
know
what
you
mean
and
what
i
daresay
you
be
only
too
willing
to
do
but
i
ca
permit
it
they
were
interrupted
by
the
spectacle
of
virgie
standing
before
them
with
anxiously
furrowed
brow
a
paper
bag
in
one
hand
and
three
spoons
clutched
in
the
other
but
colonel
morrison
she
was
saying
in
tragic
tones
there
is
a
drop
of
milk
milk
he
cried
in
mock
despair
well
dash
my
buttons
if
i
forget
to
order
a
cow
oh
know
what
to
do
cried
the
child
dropping
her
supplies
and
utensils
she
ran
to
the
wall
and
climbed
up
hey
there
commanded
the
small
general
with
an
imperious
gesture
to
the
assembled
troopers
one
of
you
men
ride
right
over
to
camp
and
bring
us
back
some
milk
an
butter
at
this
abrupt
demand
of
so
small
a
rebel
on
the
commissary
of
the
united
states
a
roar
of
laughter
went
up
from
the
troopers
though
some
of
them
had
the
grace
to
salute
and
so
relieve
the
child
of
embarrassment
virgie
virgie
called
her
father
scandalized
it
all
right
cary
morrison
laughed
she
only
starting
in
at
giving
orders
a
little
earlier
than
most
women
never
you
mind
miss
brigadier
he
comforted
we
have
all
those
luxuries
next
time
or
when
i
come
to
see
you
in
richmond
after
the
war
is
over
just
now
we
do
the
best
we
can
come
along
virgie
got
down
from
the
wall
and
pattered
up
to
the
fire
is
it
ready
yet
she
asked
with
the
perfect
directness
of
seven
years
in
a
minute
now
there
she
goes
he
took
the
pot
from
the
fire
and
set
it
down
on
a
rock
where
presently
he
brought
a
cupful
of
cold
water
to
pour
in
is
that
to
settle
it
she
asked
of
her
father
yes
child
and
i
wish
all
our
questions
were
as
easily
cleared
up
and
now
to
the
attack
virgie
pass
the
beautiful
hand
painted
china
and
let
fill
up
this
one
for
your
daddy
you
can
put
the
sugar
in
only
do
burn
those
precious
fingers
virgie
carried
the
steaming
cup
to
her
father
and
put
it
in
his
hands
with
shining
eyes
this
is
better
than
our
old
belt
supper
daddy
is
it
she
said
with
a
flirt
of
her
tangled
curls
anyway
it
nicer
she
was
back
at
the
sugar
bag
at
once
digging
out
spoonfuls
for
morrison
coffee
thank
you
miss
cary
i
am
indeed
obliged
to
you
now
do
sit
down
and
no
not
another
word
till
you
eaten
two
whole
biscuits
for
several
ecstatic
moments
the
child
munched
her
biscuits
it
had
been
a
long
time
since
she
had
eaten
anything
so
delicious
although
if
those
same
biscuits
had
appeared
on
the
cary
table
a
month
ago
they
would
have
probably
been
scorned
but
eager
as
her
appetite
was
it
did
not
stop
the
active
workings
of
her
mind
and
she
presently
was
struck
by
an
idea
which
tried
to
force
itself
out
through
a
mouthful
of
biscuit
with
the
usual
amusing
results
admonished
her
father
morrison
laughed
out
like
a
boy
and
slapped
his
knee
suppose
we
swallow
and
try
again
virgie
thus
adjured
concentrated
her
mind
on
the
task
gulped
blinked
swallowed
with
pathetically
straining
eyes
and
then
smiled
triumphantly
excuse
me
daddy
i
guess
i
was
very
polite
apology
accepted
what
were
you
going
to
say
the
child
looked
up
with
a
sweetly
serious
look
in
her
eyes
that
the
two
men
recognized
as
the
forerunner
of
true
womanly
thought
for
others
i
was
only
goin
to
ask
the
colonel
if
he
did
think
his
men
out
there
would
like
some
of
these
things
to
eat
she
said
plaintively
it
must
be
terrible
jus
to
look
on
well
bless
your
little
heart
the
northerner
cried
but
do
you
worry
about
the
boys
they
have
theirs
when
they
get
back
to
camp
go
on
and
eat
virgie
stuff
in
another
biscuit
and
look
by
jupiter
evidently
trooper
during
the
past
hours
had
foraged
or
blarneyed
most
successfully
for
out
of
the
knapsack
which
he
had
left
behind
morrison
suddenly
produced
a
small
earthenware
jam
jar
in
which
was
something
now
indubitably
liquid
in
form
but
none
the
less
sweet
yellow
appetizing
butter
pouring
a
little
on
a
biscuit
he
held
it
out
to
her
speculating
on
what
she
would
say
the
tot
took
it
hungrily
and
raised
it
to
her
lips
her
eyes
shining
and
her
face
glowing
with
anticipation
then
she
paused
and
with
a
little
cry
of
vexation
over
her
selfishness
held
out
the
biscuit
to
her
father
here
daddy
she
said
you
take
this
because
you
tried
to
bring
me
somethin
good
to
eat
yesterday
the
father
threw
a
look
at
morrison
and
caught
virgie
to
him
in
a
swift
embrace
no
dear
he
said
eat
your
nice
buttered
biscuit
and
thank
the
good
lord
for
it
your
father
will
get
more
fun
out
of
seeing
you
eat
that
little
bit
than
he
would
out
of
owning
a
whole
cellar
of
big
stone
crocks
jam
full
do
you
know
i
think
when
we
get
up
to
richmond
have
to
write
a
letter
to
the
colonel
a
nice
long
letter
thanking
him
for
all
he
done
wo
you
there
was
a
pause
for
a
moment
as
the
child
looked
over
at
morrison
revolving
the
thought
in
her
mind
the
union
officer
had
passed
into
a
sudden
reverie
the
hand
holding
his
coffee
cup
hanging
listlessly
over
his
knee
he
was
thinking
of
another
little
girl
and
one
as
dear
to
him
as
this
man
child
was
to
her
father
he
was
wondering
if
the
fortunes
of
war
would
ever
let
him
see
her
face
again
or
hear
her
voice
or
feel
her
chubby
arms
around
his
neck
she
was
very
very
far
away
well
cared
for
it
was
true
but
he
knew
only
too
well
that
it
would
need
but
one
malignant
leaden
missile
to
make
her
future
life
as
full
of
hardships
as
those
which
the
little
tot
beside
him
was
passing
through
so
much
at
least
for
the
ordinary
chances
of
war
he
was
beginning
to
wonder
how
much
had
been
added
to
these
perils
by
the
matter
of
the
pass
and
whether
his
superiors
would
see
the
situation
as
it
had
appeared
to
his
eyes
into
this
sad
reverie
virgie
soft
voice
entered
with
a
gentleness
which
roused
but
did
not
startle
him
when
she
spoke
it
seemed
as
if
some
subtle
between
their
minds
had
put
the
subject
of
his
dreams
into
the
child
mind
do
you
reckon
the
child
said
curiously
that
gertrude
is
supper
now
the
union
officer
looked
up
with
eyes
that
mutely
blessed
her
yes
dear
i
was
thinking
of
her
and
her
mother
again
he
was
silent
for
a
space
and
when
he
spoke
his
voice
was
dreamy
tender
as
he
seemed
to
look
with
unseeing
eyes
far
into
the
northland
where
dwelt
the
people
of
his
heart
do
you
know
cary
this
war
for
us
the
men
may
be
a
hell
but
what
is
it
for
those
we
leave
at
home
the
women
who
wait
and
watch
and
too
often
watch
in
vain
have
the
excitement
of
it
the
rush
the
battles
and
we
think
that
ours
is
the
harder
part
when
in
reality
we
make
our
loved
ones
lives
a
deeper
blacker
hell
than
our
own
theirs
to
watch
and
listen
with
the
love
hunger
in
their
hearts
month
in
month
out
and
often
without
a
word
theirs
to
starve
on
the
crusts
of
hope
waiting
always
waiting
hunting
the
papers
for
the
thing
they
dread
to
find
a
name
among
the
missing
a
name
among
the
dead
good
heaven
when
i
think
of
it
sometimes
morrison
dropped
his
head
between
his
clenched
fists
and
groaned
yes
yes
old
fellow
i
know
the
other
man
answered
for
in
truth
he
know
but
i
want
you
to
remember
that
for
you
the
crusts
of
hope
will
some
day
be
the
bread
of
life
and
love
slowly
the
northerner
face
came
up
out
of
his
hands
and
he
seemed
to
take
heart
again
after
all
he
had
led
a
charmed
life
so
far
perhaps
the
god
of
battles
had
written
his
name
among
those
who
would
some
day
go
back
to
live
the
life
for
which
the
almighty
made
them
god
grant
then
that
he
might
have
for
his
friend
this
man
who
in
the
time
of
his
own
greater
grief
was
unselfish
enough
to
console
him
ah
if
god
would
only
grant
that
from
this
day
on
there
would
be
no
more
of
this
hideous
fighting
morrison
eyes
met
the
other
and
he
put
out
his
hand
suddenly
there
came
the
sound
of
a
shot
another
and
another
then
a
volley
which
almost
at
once
became
a
continuous
rattle
of
musketry
the
northerner
sprang
to
his
feet
look
there
go
your
pickets
struck
dumb
by
this
sudden
return
to
the
actualities
of
life
the
two
men
stood
motionless
listening
for
every
sound
which
might
tell
them
what
it
meant
for
a
little
while
they
had
dreamed
the
dream
of
peace
only
to
have
it
rudely
shattered
but
virgie
had
not
followed
them
in
their
dreams
for
she
was
an
extremely
practical
young
lady
having
seen
food
real
food
vanish
away
before
her
very
eyes
several
times
already
she
was
quite
prepared
to
see
it
happen
again
there
she
said
in
tones
in
which
prophecy
and
resignation
were
oddly
mingled
did
i
jus
somethin
was
goin
to
happen
by
this
time
morrison
had
run
to
the
stone
wall
and
sprung
to
its
top
out
in
the
road
the
troopers
had
mounted
without
waiting
for
command
and
with
one
accord
had
faced
towards
the
firing
can
you
see
anything
cary
called
not
yet
said
morrison
i
guess
we
came
too
close
to
your
nest
and
the
hornets
are
coming
out
turner
he
commanded
and
a
trooper
hand
went
up
ride
up
to
the
fork
of
the
road
learn
what
you
can
and
report
as
the
cavalryman
struck
his
heels
into
his
horse
sides
and
dashed
up
the
road
cary
put
the
wishes
of
both
men
into
words
it
too
near
sundown
for
a
battle
it
will
only
be
a
skirmish
possibly
the
northerner
assented
and
he
looked
thoughtfully
at
virgie
but
still
what
is
it
i
ca
send
you
forward
now
in
the
face
of
that
fire
and
for
that
matter
i
ca
send
you
to
the
rear
in
five
minutes
this
road
will
be
glutted
with
cavalry
and
guns
never
mind
morrison
the
southerner
returned
i
could
go
now
anyway
why
cary
opened
out
his
hands
in
a
simple
gesture
because
in
case
of
trouble
for
you
at
headquarters
i
your
prisoner
with
his
eyes
brave
and
steady
on
the
others
he
took
the
newly
written
pass
from
his
breast
and
tore
it
in
pieces
when
you
want
me
he
said
find
me
if
there
had
been
time
for
argument
morrison
would
have
hotly
protested
against
such
but
events
were
crowding
upon
them
too
fast
from
down
the
road
came
the
sound
of
furious
galloping
almost
at
once
lieutenant
harris
riding
hard
at
the
head
of
a
troop
of
cavalry
swept
round
the
curve
and
drew
his
horse
upon
his
haunches
colonel
morrison
he
shouted
you
are
ordered
one
moment
lieutenant
interrupted
morrison
in
tones
so
even
that
cary
marveled
at
his
composure
you
get
corporal
dudley
cary
ears
ached
for
the
answer
he
knew
just
as
well
as
the
questioner
the
danger
which
might
now
be
disclosed
or
be
forever
forgotten
and
his
heart
went
out
to
the
other
in
this
moment
of
hideous
suspense
there
was
an
instant
of
hesitation
and
then
came
the
answer
sir
we
tried
hard
but
could
make
it
morrison
face
did
not
change
but
his
hands
tightened
until
the
nails
dug
deep
into
his
palms
he
had
played
and
lost
go
on
with
your
report
he
said
harris
pulled
in
his
fretting
horse
and
delivered
his
significant
news
the
rebels
are
advancing
in
force
i
was
sent
back
to
you
with
orders
to
join
major
foster
at
the
fork
and
hold
the
road
at
any
cost
two
light
field
pieces
are
coming
to
your
support
our
main
batteries
are
back
there
in
the
woods
right
said
morrison
we
go
at
once
turning
back
to
virgie
he
caught
her
up
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
little
sweetheart
hide
under
the
rocks
and
keep
close
morrison
gary
said
as
they
struck
hands
i
ca
wish
you
luck
but
our
hearts
are
with
you
as
a
man
thanks
old
fellow
said
the
enemy
as
he
sprang
over
the
wall
it
helps
god
knows
he
caught
at
his
horse
mane
and
threw
himself
into
the
saddle
without
touching
the
stirrup
while
his
voice
roared
out
his
command
ready
men
forward
shrilled
virgie
in
her
childish
treble
colonel
do
get
hurt
daddy
she
cried
as
they
crouched
down
in
their
hiding
place
behind
the
wall
is
there
going
to
be
a
a
only
a
little
one
but
you
wo
be
afraid
a
rattle
of
approaching
wheels
came
from
down
the
road
the
shock
of
steel
tires
striking
viciously
against
the
stones
the
cries
and
oaths
of
the
drivers
urging
the
horses
forward
look
cried
cary
springing
to
his
feet
in
spite
of
the
danger
in
which
his
gray
uniform
placed
him
here
come
the
field
pieces
in
a
minute
now
the
dogs
will
begin
to
bark
with
a
roar
of
wheels
and
a
clash
of
harness
and
accouterments
the
guns
rushed
by
while
the
child
stared
and
stared
her
big
eyes
almost
starting
out
of
her
face
the
dogs
she
said
in
wonder
there
was
a
single
dog
there
another
kind
of
dog
her
father
said
with
a
meaning
look
and
their
teeth
are
long
ah
there
they
go
over
yonder
on
the
hill
in
the
edge
of
the
woods
the
yankee
dogs
are
barking
now
listen
for
the
answer
together
they
listened
father
and
daughter
with
straining
ears
listened
for
the
defiant
reply
of
those
men
who
being
americans
were
never
beaten
until
hunger
and
superior
numbers
forced
them
to
the
wall
boom
a
great
sound
crashed
over
the
hills
and
rolled
echoing
through
the
woods
that
us
that
us
the
man
cried
out
exultantly
while
he
caught
the
child
closer
in
his
arms
hear
our
people
talking
honey
hear
talk
but
overhead
something
was
coming
through
the
air
and
the
child
shrank
down
in
terror
something
that
whined
and
screamed
as
it
sped
on
its
dreadful
way
and
seemed
like
a
demon
out
of
hell
searching
for
his
prey
lord
a
mercy
daddy
the
child
cried
out
what
he
patted
her
head
consolingly
nothing
at
all
but
a
shell
they
sound
much
worse
than
they
really
are
do
be
afraid
nothing
will
hurt
you
from
the
forks
of
the
road
the
sound
of
volley
firing
grew
stronger
and
as
if
in
response
the
road
to
the
union
rear
now
turned
into
a
stream
of
living
blue
with
cavalry
madly
galloping
and
sweating
infantry
hurrying
forward
as
fast
as
their
legs
could
carry
them
look
virgie
look
her
father
cried
holding
her
head
a
little
way
above
the
wall
see
those
bayonets
shining
back
there
across
the
road
a
whole
regiment
of
infantry
and
they
going
up
against
our
across
an
open
field
by
jiminy
but
those
yanks
will
get
a
mustard
bath
he
chortled
as
a
roar
of
musketry
broke
out
i
told
you
so
our
boys
are
after
them
good
work
good
work
but
again
a
shell
passed
over
them
and
again
the
world
was
filled
with
that
awful
whining
shrieking
sound
daddy
the
child
cried
with
quivering
lips
but
still
dry
eyed
i
do
those
things
i
do
there
there
darling
he
comforted
as
they
shrank
closer
under
the
protection
of
the
wall
keep
down
under
my
arm
and
they
wo
bother
you
as
he
spoke
a
twig
with
a
fresh
yellow
break
in
it
fell
from
a
tree
and
struck
his
upturned
face
he
winced
at
the
thought
that
the
bullet
might
have
flown
a
few
feet
lower
and
meanwhile
the
sound
of
the
firing
came
steadily
closer
by
jove
he
murmured
to
himself
it
a
bigger
rumpus
than
i
thought
this
indeed
was
true
what
had
at
first
promised
to
be
only
a
skirmish
between
the
outposts
of
the
two
entrenched
armies
now
developed
into
a
general
engagement
covering
a
space
of
half
a
mile
along
the
line
a
reconnoitering
force
of
federal
cavalry
had
ridden
too
close
to
the
rifle
pits
of
the
confederates
and
as
morrison
himself
expressed
it
the
hornets
came
out
and
began
to
sting
major
foster
commanding
a
larger
force
of
cavalry
rode
out
in
support
of
his
reconnoitering
party
and
found
himself
opposed
not
by
a
straggling
line
of
rebel
pickets
but
by
a
moving
wall
of
tattered
gray
the
units
of
which
advanced
on
a
run
crouching
behind
some
bush
or
stone
to
fire
reload
and
advance
again
an
aide
raced
back
to
the
union
lines
to
ask
for
help
in
support
of
foster
slender
force
of
cavalry
and
thus
the
order
came
to
morrison
to
join
the
detachment
and
hold
the
enemy
until
reinforcements
could
be
formed
and
pushed
to
the
firing
line
the
delay
however
was
well
nigh
fatal
for
morrison
and
major
foster
and
from
the
point
where
cary
and
little
virgie
watched
the
case
of
the
union
horsemen
seemed
an
evil
one
true
that
infantry
and
guns
were
soon
advancing
to
their
aid
on
a
yet
all
the
advantage
seemed
to
lie
with
the
ragged
southerners
the
crackle
of
musketry
increased
the
dust
rolled
up
and
intermingled
with
the
wreathes
of
drifting
smoke
and
through
it
came
the
vicious
whine
of
leaden
messengers
of
death
then
borne
on
the
wind
came
a
sound
that
he
would
know
till
his
dying
day
rebel
an
exultant
scream
a
cry
of
unending
hate
defiance
he
sprang
to
his
feet
off
came
the
battered
old
campaign
hat
and
unmindful
that
he
stood
there
hidden
in
the
woods
and
that
his
voice
could
carry
only
a
few
yards
against
the
roar
of
battle
he
swung
it
over
his
head
and
shouted
out
his
encouragement
look
we
whipping
virgie
do
you
hear
we
getting
them
on
the
run
come
on
boys
come
on
he
felt
her
clutch
on
his
sleeve
with
wide
eyes
grown
darker
than
ever
with
excitement
she
asked
her
piteous
question
daddy
they
kill
the
colonel
for
a
moment
he
could
not
answer
then
with
a
groan
he
gave
back
his
answer
i
not
darling
i
hope
not
down
the
road
a
riderless
horse
was
coming
head
up
and
stirrups
flying
as
it
galloped
past
cary
scrutinized
it
closely
and
was
glad
he
did
not
recognize
it
in
its
wake
came
soldiers
infantry
and
dismounted
cavalry
firing
retreating
loading
and
firing
again
but
always
retreating
here
come
the
stragglers
he
cried
we
whipping
close
darling
lie
down
against
the
wall
he
crouched
above
her
shielding
her
as
best
he
could
with
his
body
then
suddenly
a
man
in
blue
leaped
on
the
wall
not
ten
feet
away
he
had
meant
to
seize
the
wall
as
a
breastwork
and
fight
from
behind
it
but
before
he
dropped
down
he
would
fire
one
last
shot
his
gun
came
up
to
his
shoulder
he
aimed
at
some
unseen
foe
and
fired
but
from
somewhere
out
of
the
crash
of
sound
and
the
rolling
powder
smoke
a
singing
missile
came
and
found
its
mark
the
man
in
blue
bent
over
suddenly
wavered
then
toppled
down
inside
the
wall
his
gun
ringing
on
the
stones
as
he
fell
daddy
the
child
whispered
with
ashen
face
it
the
biscuit
man
it
harry
her
father
hand
went
out
instinctively
to
cover
her
eyes
do
look
dear
do
look
the
road
was
choked
now
cavalry
and
infantry
all
in
a
mad
rush
for
the
rear
were
tearing
by
while
the
two
field
pieces
which
but
a
moment
ago
had
gone
into
action
with
such
a
deadly
whirl
came
limping
back
with
slashed
traces
and
splintered
wheels
with
fascinated
eyes
the
rebel
officer
watched
from
behind
his
wall
while
everything
even
his
child
was
forgotten
in
the
lust
for
victory
and
so
he
did
not
hear
the
faint
voice
behind
him
that
cried
out
in
an
agony
of
thirst
and
pain
water
water
help
someone
give
water
virgie
with
dilated
eyes
and
heaving
breast
crouched
low
as
long
as
she
could
and
then
gave
up
everything
to
the
pitiful
appeal
ringing
in
her
ears
quick
as
a
flash
she
sped
away
on
bare
feet
over
rocks
and
sharp
pointed
branches
of
fallen
trees
to
the
spring
where
she
caught
up
a
cup
and
filled
it
to
the
brim
another
swift
rush
and
she
reached
the
fallen
man
in
blue
and
had
the
cup
at
his
lips
while
her
arm
went
under
his
head
to
lift
it
virgie
her
father
cried
frantic
at
the
sight
with
a
great
leap
he
was
at
her
side
forcing
her
down
to
the
ground
and
covering
her
with
his
body
the
trooper
head
sank
back
and
his
eyes
began
to
dull
may
god
bless
ye
little
one
he
murmured
heaven
his
lips
gave
out
one
long
shuddering
sigh
his
body
grew
slack
and
his
chin
fell
trooper
harry
had
fought
his
last
fight
had
passed
to
his
final
review
one
look
at
the
boyish
face
so
suddenly
gone
gray
and
bloodless
and
gary
caught
virgie
up
in
his
arms
come
dear
you
ca
help
him
any
more
and
with
a
crouching
run
they
were
back
once
more
in
the
shelter
of
the
wall
and
now
the
shriek
of
the
shells
and
the
whine
of
the
bullets
came
shriller
than
before
all
around
them
the
twigs
were
dropping
while
the
acrid
powder
smoke
rolled
in
through
the
trees
and
burnt
their
eyes
and
throats
again
came
men
in
blue
retreating
and
among
them
an
officer
on
horseback
wheeling
his
animal
madly
around
among
them
and
shouting
encouragement
as
he
tried
to
face
them
to
the
front
keep
at
it
men
morrison
was
crying
half
mad
with
rage
one
decent
stand
and
we
can
hold
them
give
it
to
them
hard
stand
i
tell
you
all
around
him
however
men
were
falling
and
those
who
were
left
began
to
waver
steady
men
do
flinch
came
the
shout
again
you
would
you
morrison
sword
held
flatwise
thudded
down
on
the
back
of
a
man
who
had
flung
away
his
gun
get
back
in
the
fight
you
dog
get
back
he
whipped
out
his
revolver
and
pointed
it
till
the
gun
had
been
snatched
up
then
fired
all
its
chambers
at
the
oncoming
hordes
in
gray
one
more
stand
he
yelled
one
more
beside
him
the
color
sergeant
gave
a
moan
and
bent
in
the
middle
like
a
hinge
another
slackening
of
his
body
and
the
stricken
bearer
of
the
flag
plunged
from
his
saddle
the
colors
trailing
in
the
dust
morrison
spurred
his
mount
toward
the
fallen
man
bending
to
grasp
the
colors
from
the
tight
gripped
hand
but
even
as
he
bent
his
horse
went
down
he
leaped
to
save
himself
then
turned
once
more
snatched
at
the
flag
of
his
routed
regiment
and
waved
it
above
his
head
boys
and
give
it
to
a
shout
went
up
not
from
the
men
he
sought
to
rally
to
his
flag
but
from
those
who
would
win
it
at
a
cost
of
blood
for
his
troopers
were
running
on
a
backward
road
and
morrison
fought
alone
the
gray
devils
were
all
around
him
now
and
he
backed
against
the
wall
fighting
till
his
sword
was
sent
spinning
from
his
fist
by
the
blow
of
a
musket
butt
then
grasping
the
in
both
his
hands
he
parried
bayonet
thrusts
and
saber
strokes
panting
breathing
in
hot
labored
gasps
and
cursing
his
enemies
from
a
hoarse
parched
throat
a
hideous
unequal
fight
it
was
and
soon
morrison
must
fall
as
his
colors
fell
and
be
trampled
in
the
dust
yet
now
through
an
eddying
drift
of
smoke
came
another
ragged
southerner
a
grim
gaunt
man
whose
voice
was
as
hoarse
as
morrison
who
had
grasped
a
saber
from
the
blood
stained
rocks
and
waved
it
above
his
head
back
boys
do
kill
that
man
among
them
he
plunged
till
he
reached
the
side
of
morrison
then
turned
and
faced
the
brothers
of
his
country
and
his
state
with
a
downward
stroke
he
arrested
a
saber
thrusts
and
then
struck
upward
at
a
mouth
as
it
spit
its
deadly
flame
do
kill
him
do
you
hear
he
cried
as
he
beat
at
the
bayonet
points
i
cary
herbert
cary
the
staff
of
general
lee
for
an
instant
the
attacking
southerners
stood
aghast
at
the
sight
of
this
raging
man
in
gray
who
defended
a
yankee
officer
and
yet
he
had
made
no
saber
stroke
to
wound
or
kill
instead
his
weapon
had
come
between
their
own
and
the
life
of
a
helpless
foe
for
a
moment
more
they
paused
and
looked
with
wondering
eyes
and
in
that
moment
their
victory
was
changed
to
rout
a
bugle
blared
a
thundering
rush
of
hoof
beats
sounded
on
the
road
and
the
union
reënforcements
swept
around
the
curve
six
abreast
they
came
a
regiment
of
strong
straight
riders
hungry
for
battle
hot
to
retrieve
the
losing
fortune
of
the
day
the
road
was
too
narrow
for
a
concentrated
rush
so
they
streamed
into
the
fields
on
either
side
and
swept
like
an
avalanche
of
blue
upon
their
prey
the
guns
in
the
woods
now
thundered
forth
afresh
their
echoes
rolling
out
across
the
hills
and
the
attacking
rebels
turned
and
fled
like
leaves
before
a
storm
on
one
side
of
the
road
morrison
and
cary
shrank
down
beside
the
wall
to
let
the
union
riders
pass
on
the
other
all
that
was
left
of
the
rebel
force
ran
for
a
screen
of
protecting
trees
but
before
the
last
one
disappeared
he
threw
up
his
gun
and
fired
haphazard
in
the
direction
whence
he
had
come
as
if
in
reply
came
the
sound
of
a
saber
falling
from
a
man
hand
and
striking
on
a
stone
under
his
very
eyes
and
just
as
he
was
putting
out
his
hand
to
grip
the
others
morrison
saw
herbert
cary
sinking
slowly
to
the
ground
and
then
through
the
yellow
dust
clouds
and
the
powder
smoke
and
all
the
horrid
reek
of
war
a
child
came
running
with
outstretched
arms
and
piteous
voice
a
frightened
child
weeping
for
the
father
who
had
thrown
himself
headlong
into
peril
to
save
another
life
and
who
perhaps
had
lost
his
own
chapter
ix
the
headquarters
of
the
army
of
the
potomac
on
the
morning
of
august
were
at
city
point
near
where
the
appomattox
meets
the
james
here
the
grim
silent
man
in
whose
hands
lay
the
destinies
of
the
united
states
sent
out
the
telegrams
which
kept
the
federal
forces
gnawing
at
the
cage
in
which
lee
had
shut
himself
and
meanwhile
held
to
his
strategic
position
south
of
richmond
to
his
left
and
west
lay
petersburg
still
unconquered
but
petersburg
could
wait
for
gray
clad
troopers
were
scourging
the
shenandoah
and
the
menace
must
be
removed
to
this
end
grant
had
sent
a
telegram
to
washington
three
days
before
expressing
in
unmistakable
terms
what
he
wished
general
sheridan
and
his
cavalry
to
accomplish
they
were
to
go
over
into
the
shenandoah
and
putting
themselves
of
the
enemy
follow
him
to
the
death
to
which
telegram
the
tall
lank
man
in
the
white
house
whose
kindly
heart
was
bursting
with
the
strain
replied
in
characteristic
fashion
and
told
him
that
his
purpose
was
exactly
right
and
then
with
a
gleam
of
humor
warned
him
against
influences
in
washington
which
would
prevent
its
carrying
out
unless
he
forced
it
this
message
had
come
but
a
few
minutes
before
and
it
had
been
received
with
silent
satisfaction
for
grant
knew
now
that
abraham
lincoln
and
he
were
in
perfect
accord
as
to
the
means
for
swiftly
bringing
on
the
end
but
the
plans
must
be
well
laid
and
to
that
end
he
must
leave
city
point
within
a
few
hours
and
go
north
and
so
he
was
standing
at
a
window
of
his
headquarters
this
morning
with
his
eyes
resting
unseeingly
on
the
camp
while
his
cool
quiet
mind
steadily
forged
out
his
schemes
unlike
the
headquarters
of
play
armies
where
all
is
noise
and
confusion
and
bloodied
orderlies
throw
themselves
off
of
plunging
horses
and
gasp
out
their
reports
the
room
in
which
general
grant
did
his
work
was
strangely
quiet
it
was
a
large
square
room
with
high
ceiling
and
wall
paper
which
had
defied
all
the
arts
of
europe
to
render
interesting
in
design
furniture
was
neither
plentiful
nor
comfortable
a
slippery
black
sofa
a
few
chairs
and
at
one
side
of
the
room
a
table
and
a
desk
littered
with
papers
maps
and
files
at
the
table
adjutant
forbes
sat
writing
facing
him
was
the
door
opening
out
into
the
hallway
of
the
house
where
two
sentries
stood
on
guard
in
the
silence
which
pervaded
the
room
and
in
the
quiet
application
to
the
work
in
hand
there
was
a
perfect
reflection
of
the
mind
of
him
who
stood
impassive
at
the
window
with
his
back
turned
a
faint
blue
cloud
of
cigar
smoke
rising
above
his
head
a
quick
step
sounded
in
the
corridor
the
step
of
one
who
bears
a
message
an
orderly
appeared
in
the
doorway
spoke
to
the
two
sentries
and
was
passed
in
with
a
salute
to
forbes
for
general
grant
he
said
holding
out
a
folded
note
of
white
paper
personal
from
lieutenant
harris
sir
at
the
sound
of
his
name
the
general
turned
slowly
and
accepted
the
note
which
the
orderly
presented
he
took
it
without
haste
and
yet
without
any
perceptible
loss
of
time
or
motion
and
as
always
without
unnecessary
words
scanning
it
he
shifted
his
cigar
to
one
corner
of
his
mouth
where
its
smoke
would
not
rise
into
his
eyes
thought
for
an
instant
then
nodded
shortly
i
see
him
at
once
dismissed
the
orderly
saluted
and
passed
quickly
out
the
general
with
his
chin
in
his
collar
and
his
cigar
held
between
his
fingers
at
nearly
the
same
level
moved
back
to
the
window
and
stood
there
silently
as
before
he
knew
what
lieutenant
harris
would
wish
to
speak
to
him
about
a
few
weeks
before
a
of
cavalry
had
been
on
the
charge
of
allowing
the
escape
of
a
spy
the
court
had
found
him
guilty
and
its
findings
had
been
submitted
to
the
higher
authorities
and
endorsed
by
them
a
copy
of
these
reports
now
lay
on
his
desk
all
this
his
adjutant
forbes
knew
as
well
as
the
general
himself
but
if
forbes
had
thought
it
worth
while
to
speculate
on
the
extent
of
his
commander
interest
he
might
have
guessed
for
years
without
ever
drawing
one
logical
conclusion
from
all
the
hints
that
that
impassive
face
and
figure
gave
him
again
a
ringing
step
in
the
corridor
and
this
time
lieutenant
harris
came
into
the
room
his
hand
going
up
in
salute
but
his
general
was
still
looking
out
of
the
window
his
eyes
on
a
dead
level
there
was
a
silence
and
then
without
turning
around
well
lieutenant
what
is
it
a
short
conference
general
if
you
grant
it
the
case
of
morrison
it
was
hard
work
to
talk
to
one
who
kept
his
back
turned
and
harris
was
embarrassed
the
smoke
from
the
general
cigar
still
curled
lazily
upwards
reprieve
came
the
monosyllabic
question
harris
caught
himself
together
and
put
all
his
feelings
no
general
a
at
once
grant
wheeled
and
stood
gazing
at
him
keenly
he
said
and
he
advanced
with
deliberation
to
the
desk
where
he
stood
with
his
eyes
steady
on
harris
face
lieutenant
do
you
want
me
to
think
you
are
out
of
your
mind
before
harris
could
reply
grant
stopped
him
with
a
gesture
and
picked
up
a
batch
of
papers
which
lay
on
the
desk
the
man
has
been
given
every
chance
he
has
been
and
found
guilty
he
dropped
the
papers
in
the
case
back
on
the
desk
and
you
his
counsel
having
failed
to
prove
him
otherwise
now
come
to
for
pardon
he
snapped
his
fingers
lieutenant
you
are
wasting
time
and
he
turned
away
pausing
for
a
moment
to
turn
over
a
sheaf
here
and
there
on
his
desk
and
meditate
their
contents
the
incident
of
morrison
has
been
disposed
of
and
in
another
moment
would
be
forgotten
it
was
now
or
never
for
harris
and
he
answered
quickly
i
hope
not
sir
neither
yours
nor
mine
and
then
as
the
general
looked
up
with
some
surprise
at
this
retort
you
have
read
the
findings
of
the
court
yes
was
the
grim
reply
and
approve
the
sentence
he
will
be
shot
yes
sir
acknowledged
harris
unless
intervene
at
this
curiously
insistent
plea
for
clemency
the
short
stocky
bearded
man
who
to
so
few
had
the
bearing
of
a
great
general
faced
lieutenant
harris
and
gave
him
a
look
which
made
the
young
officer
bravery
falter
for
a
long
moment
said
the
general
with
a
searching
note
in
his
voice
which
seemed
to
probe
coldly
and
with
deadly
accuracy
among
the
strenuous
emotions
in
the
young
man
mind
harris
you
are
an
officer
of
promise
do
cut
that
promise
short
with
a
flick
of
his
ashes
to
one
side
he
turned
away
the
cigar
went
back
into
the
corner
of
his
sardonic
mouth
harris
strode
forward
an
impulsive
step
and
threw
out
his
hands
it
is
worth
the
risk
when
a
man
is
condemned
to
die
the
general
wheeled
with
more
impatience
than
the
adjutant
forbes
had
seen
him
exhibit
through
many
vexatious
worrying
months
his
voice
took
on
a
rasping
note
he
tapped
the
papers
on
the
desk
with
grim
significance
morrison
has
failed
in
his
military
duty
he
released
a
rebel
spy
proved
himself
a
traitor
to
his
cause
a
traitor
general
protested
the
young
officer
do
you
call
a
man
a
traitor
who
fought
as
morrison
did
a
week
ago
who
stood
his
ground
till
his
whole
command
was
shot
to
pieces
and
then
stood
alone
defending
his
colors
in
the
face
of
hell
let
loose
the
appeal
was
impassioned
its
sincerity
and
humanity
undoubted
yet
it
seemingly
only
served
to
make
the
grim
rules
of
war
more
unyielding
than
ever
choosing
his
words
with
more
than
ordinary
care
and
speaking
them
in
firm
even
tones
the
general
made
his
reply
no
act
of
bravery
can
atone
for
a
soldier
lapse
from
duty
he
sat
down
at
his
desk
and
began
to
write
under
ordinary
circumstances
lieutenant
harris
might
have
accepted
defeat
for
there
seemed
no
use
in
trying
to
break
down
that
iron
will
or
touch
the
heart
of
this
relentless
soldier
but
this
was
something
more
than
an
ordinary
case
and
harris
was
more
than
simply
counsel
he
was
his
friend
the
two
had
fought
together
through
three
hard
campaigns
they
had
shared
food
and
water
and
shelter
had
slept
together
for
warmth
on
sodden
fields
had
exchanged
such
confidences
as
two
officers
from
the
same
town
in
the
north
but
of
unequal
rank
may
exchange
under
the
pressure
of
emotions
if
there
was
one
man
living
who
knew
morrison
heart
and
appreciated
his
motives
to
the
uttermost
it
was
his
lieutenant
and
the
young
officer
was
prepared
to
lose
his
commission
aye
even
face
prison
for
insubordination
if
continued
opposition
to
the
would
result
in
a
and
so
he
caught
himself
together
for
the
second
time
and
returned
to
the
charge
i
do
not
offer
his
courage
as
a
plea
for
pardon
he
said
and
turned
to
his
general
with
half
a
smile
but
still
i
find
in
shakespeare
and
in
blackstone
the
suggestion
of
tempering
justice
with
mercy
grant
tossed
aside
his
pencil
repeating
the
last
word
slowly
bitterly
he
rose
from
his
seat
and
stood
beside
his
table
speaking
with
a
low
but
almost
fierce
intensity
they
call
me
a
war
machine
i
am
and
you
and
all
the
rest
are
parts
of
it
a
lever
a
screw
a
valve
a
wheel
a
machine
half
human
yes
a
thing
of
muscle
and
bone
and
blood
but
without
a
heart
a
merciless
whose
wheels
must
turn
and
turn
till
we
grind
out
this
rebellion
to
the
dust
of
peace
he
paused
impressively
and
in
the
hard
cold
words
which
followed
all
hope
for
morrison
seemed
to
fade
and
die
if
a
wheel
once
fails
to
do
its
work
discard
it
for
another
and
a
better
one
want
no
wheels
that
slip
their
cogs
the
general
ceased
and
turned
to
his
littered
table
but
harris
was
not
yet
beaten
no
general
he
answered
bravely
but
there
happens
to
be
a
flaw
in
your
machine
control
the
general
looked
up
frowning
sharply
but
harris
still
went
on
in
a
military
court
we
have
condemned
a
man
to
die
the
facts
have
not
been
proved
amazed
more
at
the
young
officer
obstinate
temerity
than
his
words
the
general
stared
at
him
how
so
he
asked
with
irony
harris
opened
out
his
hands
with
a
simple
gesture
that
seemed
to
leave
his
logic
to
the
judgment
of
any
impartial
observer
in
times
of
peace
my
profession
is
that
of
the
law
i
know
my
ground
and
in
rising
tones
of
sincerity
i
challenge
you
to
shake
it
in
any
civil
court
in
christendom
strong
words
young
man
came
the
stern
reply
for
your
sake
i
hope
they
are
warranted
what
is
your
point
get
at
it
harris
drew
a
short
breath
of
relief
he
had
cleverly
switched
the
appeal
from
grounds
on
which
he
stood
no
chance
whatever
to
those
where
he
did
not
fear
any
intellect
in
a
fair
fight
the
evidence
he
said
calmly
was
purely
circumstantial
in
the
first
place
it
is
alleged
that
my
client
captured
a
rebel
spy
one
herbert
cary
who
was
hiding
in
the
loft
of
a
cabin
the
general
caustic
tones
interrupted
to
which
fact
he
said
there
were
only
witnesses
yes
general
was
the
faintly
smiling
agreement
ten
but
not
one
of
them
actually
the
man
they
he
was
there
but
they
can
not
swear
to
it
grant
made
a
motion
as
of
putting
away
something
of
no
consequence
immaterial
in
view
of
the
other
facts
well
what
else
next
it
is
claimed
that
morrison
released
this
spy
and
allowed
him
to
enter
the
union
lines
without
regard
to
consequences
the
general
gave
a
short
exclamation
of
impatience
and
struck
the
papers
on
his
desk
with
the
flat
of
his
hand
and
that
is
he
said
sharply
proved
by
several
officers
who
stopped
your
spy
at
points
along
the
road
he
singled
out
a
soiled
piece
of
paper
from
the
sheaf
before
him
and
held
it
up
a
piece
of
paper
which
bore
writing
on
both
sides
when
taken
was
found
on
his
person
not
circumstantial
evidence
but
signed
on
one
side
by
lee
and
on
the
other
by
colonel
morrison
he
laughed
shortly
over
the
futility
of
argument
under
such
circumstances
do
you
presume
to
contest
this
to
his
amazement
the
young
officer
facing
him
bowed
easily
and
smiled
in
turn
i
emphatically
was
given
herbert
cary
either
by
colonel
morrison
general
lee
cried
the
general
angrily
harris
only
pointed
read
it
sir
if
you
please
he
watched
till
grant
eyes
started
to
scan
the
pass
again
and
then
repeated
the
words
which
he
knew
so
well
pass
and
escort
through
federal
and
confederate
lines
cary
general
is
a
and
a
child
may
mean
a
single
person
or
it
may
mean
a
whole
troop
of
cavalry
to
his
infinite
relief
and
joy
his
commanding
general
looked
up
at
him
thoughtfully
then
slowly
rose
from
his
desk
and
took
a
turn
about
the
room
followed
by
a
faint
blue
trail
of
cigar
smoke
he
paused
and
what
does
say
he
asked
again
harris
smiled
the
quiet
smile
of
the
lawyer
who
has
been
confronted
with
such
questions
before
and
knows
well
how
to
answer
them
he
too
is
on
trial
for
his
life
his
evidence
naturally
was
not
admitted
ah
then
what
says
nothing
sir
was
the
young
lieutenant
calm
reply
the
burden
of
proof
lies
with
the
prosecution
not
with
the
defendant
and
this
is
your
contention
your
flaw
in
my
machine
the
general
asked
sharply
it
is
very
good
sir
very
good
in
that
case
we
call
in
these
silent
partners
and
dig
into
this
case
until
we
reach
rock
bottom
forbes
he
ordered
send
for
the
prisoner
morrison
and
the
rebel
herbert
cary
i
want
both
of
them
here
at
once
in
the
pause
which
followed
the
adjutant
exit
harris
interposed
an
objection
your
method
general
is
hardly
just
to
the
interests
of
my
client
grant
turned
on
him
with
something
mere
than
impatience
he
was
growing
angry
lieutenant
harris
are
you
asking
me
to
pardon
a
guilty
man
it
the
truth
i
want
not
legal
technicalities
next
you
be
asking
me
not
to
hang
this
rebel
spy
because
he
has
a
baby
he
went
back
to
his
accustomed
place
at
the
window
and
stood
looking
out
again
his
hands
clasped
loosely
behind
his
back
the
eternal
cigar
smoke
rising
above
his
head
then
to
the
young
lieutenant
amazement
he
asked
a
question
in
tones
of
ordinary
conversation
harris
he
said
who
was
the
man
who
preferred
these
charges
to
start
with
corporal
dudley
was
the
eager
answer
and
there
general
is
another
point
and
a
vital
one
that
was
not
brought
out
in
reporting
his
colonel
dudley
was
actuated
not
by
a
spirit
of
military
duty
but
personal
revenge
revenge
why
because
morrison
shot
and
killed
dudley
brother
a
sergeant
in
his
command
the
general
came
back
from
his
window
again
why
for
insubordination
incendiarism
attempted
desertion
came
the
swift
reply
the
general
eyebrows
raised
a
fraction
of
an
inch
he
seated
himself
at
his
desk
and
unrolled
a
map
any
witnesses
of
the
sergeant
death
he
asked
evenly
as
he
proceeded
to
study
his
map
unfortunately
only
one
harris
replied
an
old
negro
now
in
our
camp
answering
to
the
name
of
william
lewis
lewis
lewis
said
grant
thoughtfully
he
referred
for
a
moment
to
a
file
of
papers
and
then
looked
up
is
that
the
old
codger
who
been
worrying
my
entire
staff
for
permission
to
go
through
our
lines
to
his
home
yes
general
said
harris
with
a
smile
for
unc
billy
persistency
and
his
troubles
were
known
to
everyone
he
met
good
it
about
time
we
got
even
him
the
general
remarked
sardonically
have
him
in
see
to
it
forbes
and
again
he
bent
over
his
map
forbes
passing
out
again
paused
as
harris
gestured
you
find
him
somewhere
near
the
guard
house
the
lieutenant
said
with
a
flicker
of
a
smile
the
old
man
has
been
regularly
camping
out
there
since
he
learned
that
his
master
was
inside
a
minute
passed
and
then
from
a
short
distance
away
came
the
sound
of
a
squad
of
soldiers
marching
in
single
file
with
the
two
prisoners
in
line
the
squad
came
into
the
hallway
and
stopped
at
the
doorway
left
face
order
arms
prisoners
file
out
the
two
prisoners
stepped
forward
and
entered
the
room
thanks
to
expert
surgical
work
since
he
entered
union
lines
herbert
cary
wounds
had
healed
quickly
while
plenty
of
good
food
had
done
the
rest
his
eyes
may
not
have
been
bright
with
hope
but
at
least
they
were
clear
with
health
and
his
straight
back
and
squared
shoulders
showed
that
the
man
fighting
spirit
had
not
left
him
even
under
the
adverse
decision
of
a
of
the
two
morrison
seemed
the
graver
and
quieter
with
his
sword
taken
from
him
and
his
shoulder
straps
ripped
off
the
man
who
had
been
a
in
the
army
of
the
potomac
only
the
day
before
stood
looking
at
his
general
without
the
slightest
hope
for
clemency
yet
with
all
the
sad
quiet
look
of
resignation
in
his
eyes
behind
them
glowed
a
wonderful
light
the
light
of
for
he
had
chosen
to
put
on
the
tender
glove
of
humanity
and
grip
hands
with
the
mailed
gauntlet
of
war
and
though
he
had
been
crushed
yet
even
in
this
bitter
hour
they
could
not
take
from
him
the
knowledge
that
the
commander
in
chief
of
all
spiritual
armies
would
stand
forever
on
his
side
they
could
take
his
sword
and
shoulder
straps
but
they
could
not
rob
him
of
that
divine
consolation
and
so
the
two
stood
with
their
eyes
steady
on
the
general
the
confederate
hard
and
defiant
the
union
officer
with
a
strange
sad
glow
on
his
face
but
the
general
paid
them
no
attention
he
was
still
studying
the
map
laid
out
before
him
on
his
desk
the
cigar
in
the
corner
of
his
mouth
drawing
one
side
of
his
face
into
harsh
deep
lines
as
a
matter
of
fact
ulysses
simpson
grant
was
very
far
removed
from
harshness
he
was
simply
and
solely
efficiency
personified
when
nothing
was
to
be
said
general
grant
said
nothing
to
do
otherwise
was
waste
presently
he
looked
up
and
saw
that
while
forbes
had
given
the
two
prisoners
chairs
directly
in
front
of
his
desk
one
of
the
important
factors
in
the
business
in
hand
had
not
been
produced
well
forbes
well
where
is
the
negro
he
asked
crisply
bring
him
in
bring
him
in
in
a
moment
general
responded
the
adjutant
hastening
to
the
doorway
as
the
tread
of
feet
sounded
again
in
the
hallway
dismissing
the
two
privates
who
had
arrived
with
uncle
billy
between
them
he
led
the
old
man
down
to
the
desk
and
left
him
there
bowing
and
scraping
a
little
and
holding
his
hat
in
front
of
him
in
both
hands
wan
see
suh
ventured
uncle
billy
intruding
delicately
on
the
general
calculations
here
i
is
general
grant
looked
up
quickly
and
ran
his
eye
over
the
old
man
your
name
er
william
lewis
seh
yas
seh
to
whom
do
you
belong
although
uncle
billy
back
was
not
particularly
straight
this
sudden
question
introduced
a
stiffening
into
it
which
made
it
more
upright
than
it
had
been
in
years
i
to
hubbert
cary
seh
of
de
army
das
who
i
to
yas
seh
the
general
sat
back
a
little
in
his
chair
and
studied
uncle
billy
he
saw
that
after
all
the
old
negro
was
simply
a
natural
slave
that
he
probably
had
no
other
thought
in
his
grayed
head
than
that
of
faithful
service
to
his
owner
but
he
would
try
him
and
see
how
far
the
old
man
would
go
i
understand
he
said
that
freedom
has
been
offered
you
and
you
refused
it
is
this
true
yas
seh
asked
the
general
quietly
uncle
billy
stammered
well
er
well
me
mars
but
but
down
whar

de
de
white
understands
a
nigger
what
does
yas
seh
general
grant
may
have
smiled
internally
but
the
only
symptom
of
amusement
was
the
dry
note
in
his
voice
i
see
but
there
has
been
some
difference
of
opinion
on
the
point
he
paused
and
then
pointed
past
uncle
billy
directly
at
morrison
do
you
know
that
man
me
said
uncle
billy
he
turned
and
saw
morrison
and
instantly
his
face
lighted
up
it
made
no
difference
to
the

the

nodded
his
lips
tight
shut
so
i
understand
but
what
did
he
do
or
say
at
this
question
uncle
billy
suddenly
developed
dramatic
abilities
that
his
master
had
never
dreamed
of
he
say
and
uncle
billy
arm
shot
out
as
he
pointed
something
deadly
at
an
invisible
foe
he
say
dudley

the
general
eyes
were
on
his
desk
and
for
a
moment
there
was
a
pause
finally
he
lifted
his
head
and
looked
at
morrison
who
rose
in
salute
morrison
you
did
well
your
sergeant
failed
in
his
military
duty
and
deserved
the
punishment
i
commend
your
action
harris
listening
with
all
his
might
thought
the
words
more
favorable
than
the
tone
in
which
they
were
spoken
and
his
face
brightened
then
he
heard
the
general
speaking
more
sternly
the
federal
powers
of
administrative
justice
now
occupy
precisely
the
same
position
with
regard
to
your
own
default
harris
face
darkened
after
the
first
just
encomium
what
was
this
that
was
coming
relentless
and
inflexible
the
voice
went
on
the
rules
of
war
as
applied
to
a
officer
must
also
govern
his
superiors
as
sergeant
dudley
deserved
his
bullet
you
merit
his
eyes
dropped
from
morrison
face
and
he
looked
up
at
harris
a
bad
witness
for
your
client
lieutenant
he
said
grimly
as
he
nodded
his
head
towards
uncle
billy
you
ought
to
study
law
take
him
away
and
he
picked
up
a
fresh
cigar
from
a
box
in
front
of
him
and
tossed
the
old
one
out
of
the
window
uncle
billy
with
a
puzzled
look
on
his
face
slowly
yielded
to
the
touch
of
the
two
soldiers
who
stepped
into
the
room
at
a
gesture
from
forbes
he
seemed
to
realize
that
his
testimony
had
not
been
of
much
avail
though
just
why
was
indeed
a
mystery
one
thing
however
was
quite
clear
me
mars
i
i
do
need
dat
ar
pass

now
an
i
much
obliged
to
you
fer
givin
it

at
the
doorway
he
bowed
with
careful
politeness
to
each
occupant
of
the
fatal
room
good
mornin
mars
cary
good
mornin
mornin
with
the
disappearance
of
bewildered
uncle
billy
the
general
swung
around
on
the
officer
who
no
longer
wore
his
shoulder
straps
morrison
he
said
in
his
distinct
even
tones
your
friend
and
counsel
lieutenant
harris
has
applied
to
me
for
your
pardon
cried
morrison
springing
to
his
feet
with
an
exclamation
of
amazement
exactly
was
the
crisp
response
it
comes
from
him
not
from
you
but
still
as
an
interested
party
have
you
anything
to
say
in
your
own
behalf
the
union
officer
stared
at
his
general
for
a
moment
without
replying
yes
there
were
many
things
that
might
be
said
all
of
them
honest
arguments
in
his
own
behalf
all
of
them
weighted
with
right
and
humanity
but
none
of
them
worth
putting
into
words
in
the
face
of
this
deadly
machine
of
war
this
grim
austere
unyielding
tribunal
he
wavered
for
a
moment
on
his
feet
as
a
terrible
wave
of
despair
surged
over
him
then
made
a
faint
gesture
of
negation
i
have
nothing
to
say
sir
captain
cary
ordered
the
general
and
as
cary
rose
unsteadily
to
his
feet
no
keep
your
seat
sir
you
are
wounded
is
it
true
as
i
learn
from
this
report
that
during
a
skirmish
a
week
ago
you
helped
defend
the
union
colors
against
your
own
people
cary
shot
up
from
his
chair
with
a
fiery
rush
of
anger
no
sir
i
defended
the
not
the
soldier
or
his
flag
ah
ejaculated
the
general
leaning
back
in
his
chair
and
blowing
out
a
cloud
of
smoke
in
surprise
you
draw
a
rather
fine
distinction
captain
you
saved
the
colors
you
failed
to
save
the
man
you
had
better
have
let
him
die
as
an
honorable
soldier
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
and
the
general
asked
is
it
true
that
you
were
actuated
by
a
debt
of
gratitude
yes
answered
the
southerner
throwing
back
his
head
and
a
greater
debt
than
i
can
ever
hope
to
pay
his
mercy
to
my
little
girl
without
relaxing
for
a
moment
his
grip
on
the
points
of
the
case
no
matter
what
human
elements
might
be
drawn
into
it
the
general
instantly
rose
and
shot
out
an
accusing
forefinger
at
the
confederate
and
the
pass
he
gave
you
their
eyes
clashed
but
the
southerner
lowered
his
own
not
a
whit
and
backed
them
furthermore
with
honest
anger
her
he
answered
and
drove
the
reply
home
with
clenched
jaws
the
general
relaxed
and
smiled
another
fine
distinction
he
said
resuming
his
seat
he
knocked
the
ashes
from
his
cigar
and
presently
looked
up
with
another
one
of
those
terribly
vital
questions
which
came
so
simply
from
his
lips
did
you
ever
penetrate
the
federal
lines
by
means
of
a
uniform
of
blue
the
confederate
drew
back
as
he
felt
the
assault
on
his
rights
as
a
soldier
as
to
that
general
grant
there
is
answer
me
came
the
sharp
command
or
one
moment
general
interrupted
harris
with
a
lawyer
quick
objection
if
no
interference
harris
came
the
curt
order
answer
me
captain
or
the
southerner
face
flushed
and
he
threw
back
his
head
with
the
superb
defiance
that
general
grant
knew
so
well
which
was
his
one
eternal
stumbling
block
and
due
to
continue
for
another
full
year
of
blood
under
the
rulings
of
law
the
confederate
captain
said
in
ringing
tones
i
deny
even
right
to
the
question
to
the
surprise
of
everyone
the
general
merely
nodded
that
is
all
sir
thank
you
he
said
and
cary
with
a
look
of
surprise
slowly
resumed
his
seat
mr
morrison
the
union
officer
rose
and
saluted
as
a
military
servant
of
the
united
states
government
you
were
ordered
to
pursue
this
man
and
take
him
dead
or
alive
in
this
you
failed
morrison
inclined
his
head
gravely
but
shot
a
look
of
respectful
objection
at
his
superior
in
part
i
failed
instantly
the
accusing
forefinger
was
leveled
at
him
across
the
desk
and
the
point
made
with
terrible
directness
knowing
he
was
a
spy
morrison
shook
his
head
not
to
my
personal
knowledge
sir
i
hunted
him
many
times
but
never
while
he
wore
a
federal
uniform
and
when
you
captured
him
in
reply
morrison
simply
indicated
cary
tattered
coat
of
gray
ah
then
you
capture
him
yes
came
the
quiet
answer
and
he
the
escort
mentioned
in
your
pass
yes
morrison
answered
slowly
h
said
the
general
he
rose
and
turned
to
harris
i
am
afraid
my
dear
harris
that
in
spite
of
fine
spun
distinctions
and
your
legal
technicalities
the
findings
of
our
court
were
not
far
wrong
dropping
his
handful
of
papers
on
the
desk
he
caught
morrison
eye
and
rasped
out
his
analysis
of
the
case
captain
cary
practically
admits
his
guilt
were
aware
of
it
and
yet
you
send
him
through
the
very
center
of
our
lines
a
carte
blanche
to
learn
the
disposition
of
our
forces
our
weakness
and
our
strength
and
to
make
his
report
in
richmond
he
was
an
enemy
with
a
price
on
his
head
and
you
trusted
him
spy
as
the
general
had
been
speaking
the
first
few
words
of
his
contemptuous
summing
up
morrison
saw
where
they
would
lead
and
his
manhood
instantly
leaped
up
in
reply
i
trusted
not
the
spy
but
he
said
with
honest
courage
then
as
the
general
turned
his
back
on
him
with
a
contemptuous
snap
of
his
fingers
general
i
have
offered
no
defense
if
the
justice
of
law
prescribes
a
firing
squad
i
find
no
fault
i
failed
i
pay
with
a
gesture
which
indicated
gary
the
disgraced
officer
of
the
army
of
the
potomac
shot
out
his
one
and
only
defense
of
his
action
at
an
unyielding
back
i
took
this
man
hunted
wounded
fighting
to
reach
the
side
of
a
hungry
child
i
captured
him
and
by
the
rules
of
war
i
was
about
to
have
him
shot
then
he
asked
me
to
get
his
little
girl
safely
to
richmond
and
not
to
let
her
know
about
him
and
she
believed
in
me
even
as
i
trusted
herbert
cary
to
pierce
the
very
center
of
your
lines
as
a
father
not
a
spy
from
behind
the
unyielding
back
came
a
statement
of
fact
firm
and
pitiless
and
it
cost
you
your
sword
your
life
morrison
centered
his
eyes
on
the
back
of
the
general
head
and
sent
his
answer
home
with
all
the
power
of
his
voice
and
spirit
i
have
no
he
said
in
the
duty
of
a
military
servant
i
have
failed
but
my
prisoner
still
lives
i
could
accept
the
confidence
of
his
child
the
trust
of
innocence
a
baby
kiss
with
the
blood
of
her
father
on
my
hands
he
dropped
his
hands
and
half
turned
away
the
general
turned
a
little
at
a
time
first
his
head
and
then
his
shoulders
a
very
pretty
sentiment
he
remarked
dryly
but
you
seem
to
forget
that
we
are
not
making
love
but
with
a
supreme
burst
of
anger
at
his
helplessness
before
the
brute
forces
which
would
presently
send
him
forth
to
the
firing
squad
morrison
wheeled
on
his
commanding
general
and
flared
forth
with
his
last
reply
yes
and
the
hellish
laws
that
govern
it
but
there
is
another
law
through
a
trooper
in
my
command
the
home
of
an
enemy
was
turned
to
ashes
his
loved
ones
flung
out
to
starve
when
a
helpless
tot
had
lost
its
mother
and
a
father
would
protect
it
then
demands
that
i
smash
a
baby
one
last
hope
in
the
name
of
the
stars
and
stripes
and
then
to
march
back
home
to
a
happy
triumphant
north
and
meet
baby
with
the
memory
of
a
butcher
in
my
heart
heaven
sir
i
rather
hang
for
a
moment
general
and
colonel
regarded
each
other
fixedly
and
then
the
general
turned
away
to
pace
the
floor
presently
he
came
to
his
decision
and
walked
slowly
back
to
his
desk
lieutenant
harris
he
said
in
tones
whose
significance
could
not
be
misunderstood
i
was
right
you
have
wasted
your
time
and
mine
then
he
sighed
wearily
and
made
a
last
gesture
to
forbes
he
said
it
was
all
over
and
then
to
the
ears
of
the
two
prisoners
who
stood
looking
at
one
another
with
sad
eyes
came
a
sound
which
made
both
men
start
and
look
again
with
apprehension
written
on
their
faces
the
shrill
scream
of
a
child
who
is
being
kept
from
something
she
has
set
her
heart
upon
another
moment
and
there
was
a
rush
of
tiny
feet
in
the
hall
whereupon
the
two
sentries
crossed
their
rifles
across
the
doorway
but
what
might
have
proved
a
serious
obstruction
for
a
man
was
only
an
absurdity
to
a
child
quick
wit
and
virgie
with
a
little
duck
of
her
sunny
head
dodged
quickly
under
the
muskets
and
charged
flushed
and
panting
on
the
general
desk
you
sha
shoot
colonel
morrison
cried
this
astonishing
new
comer
in
tones
of
shrill
command
as
she
stamped
her
little
foot
i
wo
let
you
you
sha
you
sha
a
moment
of
displeased
surprise
on
the
part
of
the
general
then
take
the
child
out
of
here
he
ordered
i
wo
answered
virgie
tossing
her
curls
back
and
standing
her
ground
with
angry
eyes
orderly
called
the
general
with
a
whirl
virgie
dashed
away
from
the
desk
eluded
the
orderly
and
threw
herself
into
her
father
arms
oh
daddy
daddy
you
wo
let
him
shoot
the
colonel
daddy
you
wo
you
wo
she
burst
into
a
passionate
flood
of
tears
cary
lifted
his
hand
to
the
general
in
a
plea
for
a
moment
respite
from
force
general
please
she
go
he
turned
to
the
sobbing
child
and
shook
her
gently
virgie
virgie
listen
honey
general
lee
the
bowed
head
rose
from
her
father
shoulder
the
little
shoulders
stiffened
and
eye
to
eye
she
looked
into
the
face
of
cary
as
his
pleading
voice
went
on
would
want
you
to
cry
like
this
he
said
a
brave
little
soldier
to
stay
there
all
alone
dixie
and
i
are
of
her
the
littlest
rebel
chin
went
up
and
she
bravely
choked
back
her
sobs
if
this
was
what
her
general
wanted
this
her
general
would
have
though
childhood
sobs
are
hard
to
check
when
a
little
heart
is
aching
for
the
pain
of
those
she
loves
go
now
darling
her
father
pleaded
go
she
kissed
him
and
turned
in
silent
slow
obedience
casting
a
scowl
at
the
grim
and
silent
general
grant
then
moved
toward
the
guarded
door
wait
said
a
quiet
voice
harris
they
say
that
fools
and
children
speak
the
truth
he
paused
and
then
said
gently
come
here
little
girl
come
here
and
talk
to
me
somewhat
in
fear
now
that
the
kind
voice
robbed
her
of
her
anger
the
little
pale
faced
child
choked
down
her
sobs
and
came
slowly
forward
to
the
desk
but
as
she
stood
there
her
courage
returned
and
marvel
of
marvels
her
tiny
hand
went
up
in
imitation
of
a
salute
grant
dropped
his
chin
in
his
hand
so
that
their
heads
were
nearly
on
a
level
across
his
desk
and
looked
at
her
with
gentle
kindness
in
his
eyes
the
littlest
rebel
eh
he
said
in
low
tones
how
old
are
you
goin
on
eight
responded
virgie
gulping
down
a
sob
and
nervously
fingering
her
tattered
dress
ah
yes
he
nodded
and
do
you
know
the
uniform
of
a
union
officer
when
you
see
it
virgie
small
mouth
dropped
open
at
the
absurdity
of
the
question
and
she
almost
laughed
a
yankee
she
queried
with
scorn
well
i
reckon
i
to
by
time
very
good
the
brown
bearded
man
nodded
and
gently
blew
smoke
at
the
ceiling
now
tell
me
when
you
lived
at
home
and
afterwards
in
your
cabin
did
your
father
come
to
see
you
often
virgie
sunny
head
nodded
in
emphatic
asseveration
yes
sir
often
often
asked
the
bearded
man
virgie
fingers
twisted
themselves
deep
in
her
dress
i
i
do
know
sir
but
heaps
of
times
good
again
and
the
questioner
actually
smiled
when
your
father
came
did
he
ever
wear
clothes
that
that
were
not
his
own
virgie
turned
a
look
on
her
father
but
as
he
could
not
help
her
puzzled
eyes
went
back
to
the
general
well
well
lots
of
our
men
do
have
hardly
clo
she
said
pathetically
another
smile
broke
the
sternness
of
the
general
face
that
is
what
i
mean
he
explained
gently
did
he
ever
wear
a
coat
of
blue
a
uniform
broke
in
harris
lieutenant
grant
frowned
he
turned
back
to
virgie
and
coaxed
her
a
little
well
tell
me
with
one
bare
big
toe
twisted
under
her
foot
and
fingers
interlocked
in
agony
the
child
turned
a
look
of
pure
anguish
on
her
silent
grave
faced
father
this
was
torture
and
she
could
not
escape
oh
daddy
daddy
she
burst
forth
with
a
wail
of
tragedy
in
her
voice
must
i
tell
the
father
lips
which
had
been
closed
against
the
pain
that
racked
him
softened
with
the
perfect
trust
which
went
into
his
gentle
command
the
virgie
whatever
the
general
asks
the
general
observant
eyes
rested
on
the
proud
southerner
for
an
instant
noted
that
his
face
was
quite
without
anxiety
then
went
back
to
the
little
child
well
did
he
he
asked
sir
answered
virgie
with
a
gulp
the
general
nodded
and
his
face
grew
grave
again
i
wonder
if
you
even
know
what
it
means
a
yes
sir
said
the
littlest
rebel
and
dropped
her
eyes
hm
and
do
you
remember
how
many
times
he
came
that
way
yes
sir
came
the
instant
answer
and
she
threw
up
her
head
echoed
the
general
surprised
are
you
sure
yes
sir
she
answered
she
drew
herself
up
proudly
forgetting
the
poor
tattered
dress
and
her
clear
eyes
rested
fearlessly
on
two
others
that
read
through
them
down
into
the
pure
whiteness
of
her
soul
said
the
quiet
voice
again
while
the
perspiration
started
out
on
the
forehead
of
more
than
one
listener
and
remember
what
your
father
said
just
now
when
was
it
again
the
fearless
eyes
of
the
child
the
littlest
rebel
of
them
all
rose
to
the
gaze
of
the
man
whose
iron
heel
was
crushing
them
into
the
ground
and
she
made
her
answer
as
crystal
clear
and
truthful
as
if
she
stood
before
the
throne
on
the
last
great
day
when
when
daddy
came
through
the
woods
an
an
put
my
mamma
in
the
ground
there
was
a
silence
no
one
moved
outside
in
the
trees
and
bushes
the
song
the
summer
insects
were
singing
suddenly
burst
upon
their
ears
and
the
myriad
noises
of
the
camp
hitherto
unnoticed
became
a
veritable
clamor
so
complete
was
the
stillness
in
the
room
everyone
except
perhaps
the
child
herself
realized
the
vital
importance
of
her
answer
and
now
that
it
had
been
given
the
crisis
had
passed
the
littlest
rebel
had
put
an
end
to
questioning
an
audible
sigh
went
up
from
everyone
except
the
man
behind
the
desk
this
one
turned
his
head
slowly
towards
the
confederate
prisoner
captain
cary
is
this
true
yes
general
came
the
straightforward
answer
i
went
to
your
nearest
post
with
a
flag
of
truce
and
asked
permission
to
go
to
my
dead
wife
i
was
refused
i
went
permission
general
grant
rose
to
his
feet
centering
the
other
eyes
with
his
own
he
spoke
to
him
as
one
officer
speaks
to
another
when
he
expects
the
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
and
you
give
me
your
word
as
a
soldier
and
a
gentleman
that
once
once
you
wore
a
federal
uniform
and
that
because
of
the
burial
of
your
wife
i
do
answered
herbert
cary
a
rebel
to
the
last
and
that
was
the
only
cause
in
heaven
or
hell
that
could
have
me
to
wear
it
for
a
moment
the
commander
of
the
army
of
the
potomac
surveyed
the
still
defiant
prisoner
then
turned
his
back
and
walked
to
the
window
where
he
tossed
away
a
much
chewed
cigar
meantime
thinking
out
his
last
analysis
here
was
a
man
who
had
been
hunted
tirelessly
month
after
month
as
a
rebel
spy
it
was
true
that
he
was
a
spy
and
true
that
he
had
worn
a
uniform
of
blue
yet
the
fact
had
been
established
by
the
spotless
honesty
of
a
little
child
that
he
had
worn
the
uniform
only
so
that
he
might
reach
his
home
and
bury
his
dead
and
went
on
the
cool
quiet
mind
since
the
man
was
a
spy
how
could
a
union
officer
be
executed
for
assisting
a
to
escape
coming
back
to
his
desk
again
the
general
picked
out
another
smoke
felt
of
it
thoughtfully
sniffed
at
it
then
raised
his
quiet
eyes
morrison
he
said
in
clear
incisive
tones
back
to
your
command
five
words
five
short
plain
words
yet
they
made
all
the
difference
between
a
firing
squad
and
a
chance
at
life
again
there
was
a
silence
then
a
gasp
from
morrison
dry
throat
at
the
sound
of
his
title
at
the
sound
of
that
blessed
order
which
by
right
of
supreme
power
instantly
restored
him
to
his
rank
the
union
officer
leaped
to
his
feet
with
a
cry
of
joy
but
it
was
not
even
for
those
around
him
in
that
little
room
to
know
the
wonderful
vista
of
happiness
which
opened
up
again
before
the
eyes
which
only
a
moment
ago
had
been
doomed
to
close
in
the
sleep
of
a
disgraceful
death
the
general
hand
went
up
in
a
gesture
which
checked
his
gratitude
the
time
you
are
forced
to
decide
between
military
duty
and
humanity
think
twice
he
turned
to
his
desk
and
took
up
a
small
piece
of
paper
crumpled
and
torn
captain
cary
he
said
i
sincerely
regret
that
i
can
not
honor
the
pass
as
given
you
by
colonel
morrison
and
he
turned
the
paper
over
but
i
do
honor
the
pass
of
your
general
lee
he
folded
the
paper
and
held
it
out
to
cary
who
came
forward
as
if
in
a
dream
then
the
general
turned
his
back
again
and
began
to
rummage
on
his
desk
the
incident
was
closed
but
there
was
a
rush
of
bare
childish
feet
sand
before
he
could
escape
virgie
brown
little
arms
were
round
him
and
her
dimpled
chin
was
pressed
against
his
waist
the
general
made
no
effort
to
release
himself
but
looked
down
on
her
with
a
softer
light
in
his
face
than
any
of
his
men
had
seen
there
in
many
months
and
as
for
you
young
lady
the
next
time
you
pervert
my
officers
and
upset
the
discipline
of
the
federal
army
well
i
do
know
do
with
you
he
looked
down
into
her
face
and
read
there
a
wistful
feminine
appeal
for
outward
and
visible
reconciliation
oh
well
he
said
with
mock
resignation
i
suppose
i
got
to
do
it
and
he
stooped
and
kissed
her
then
he
took
up
his
campaign
hat
and
walked
towards
the
door
behind
him
the
child
in
her
tattered
dress
and
bare
brown
legs
stood
still
and
threw
out
her
arms
to
him
in
a
last
thank
you
called
the
littlest
rebel
with
the
light
of
heaven
in
her
eyes
thank
you
for
daddy
and
colonel
morrison
and
you
another
mighty
good
damn
yankee
and
then
with
a
cry
of
surpassing
joy
and
love
she
rushed
back
to
where
the
two
men
waited
for
her
on
their
knees
chapter
x
in
the
shade
of
a
fringe
of
trees
that
edged
the
river
bank
a
troop
of
cavalry
was
drawn
up
in
one
long
thin
line
knee
to
knee
the
silent
riders
sat
waiting
waiting
not
for
a
charge
upon
the
enemy
or
orders
for
a
foray
through
an
already
harried
land
they
waited
for
a
leader
a
man
who
had
led
them
through
the
heat
and
cold
through
peaceful
valleys
and
the
bloody
ruck
of
battle
a
man
whom
they
loved
and
trusted
fearing
him
only
when
they
shirked
a
duty
or
disobeyed
the
iron
laws
of
war
this
man
had
been
taken
from
them
himself
a
servant
who
had
disobeyed
these
laws
his
sword
dishonored
his
shoulder
straps
ripped
off
before
their
eyes
and
now
the
troopers
waited
and
for
what
an
order
had
come
which
put
them
on
review
a
long
thin
line
of
horsemen
waiting
on
the
river
bank
while
the
sun
beat
down
on
the
parched
red
fields
and
the
waters
of
the
muddy
james
lazed
by
as
they
murmured
their
sad
low
song
the
troopers
were
silent
waiting
a
horse
stamped
idly
in
the
dust
and
a
saber
rattled
against
a
booted
leg
a
whisper
ran
down
the
line
the
eyes
of
the
men
turned
slowly
at
the
sight
of
a
single
rider
who
advanced
from
the
distant
union
camp
he
did
not
take
the
dusty
road
which
swept
in
a
wide
to
where
the
waiting
troopers
sat
in
line
but
jumped
a
low
and
came
straight
across
the
fields
an
officer
he
was
erect
in
his
saddle
chin
up
and
shoulders
squared
on
his
shoulders
his
straps
had
been
replaced
and
his
saber
rattled
against
his
thigh
to
the
rise
and
fall
of
his
horse
stride
straight
on
he
came
till
he
checked
his
mount
before
the
center
of
the
waiting
line
and
the
troopers
knew
that
morrison
had
once
more
come
into
his
own
their
sabers
rasped
from
out
the
scabbards
and
rose
in
a
joyous
swift
salute
while
morrison
once
dishonored
sword
acknowledged
it
the
long
line
stiffened
and
waited
for
their
officer
to
speak
yet
the
voice
was
not
the
voice
of
an
officer
in
command
but
that
of
a
comrade
and
a
friend
thank
you
boys
it
good
to
be
back
again
he
swallowed
something
in
his
throat
and
struggled
manfully
to
speak
in
even
tones
i
must
ask
you
to
be
quiet
and
not
to
he
stopped
again
his
troop
had
disobeyed
him
disobeyed
him
to
a
man
a
shout
went
up
deep
joyous
and
uncontrolled
its
echoes
pulsing
out
across
the
hot
red
fields
till
it
reached
the
distant
camp
and
grant
looked
up
from
a
war
map
crisscross
lines
grunted
and
lit
a
fresh
cigar
and
morrison
sat
his
horse
before
his
cheering
line
of
men
silent
happy
while
two
tears
rolled
unheeded
down
his
cheek
a
soldier
and
a
man
his
tenderness
to
a
little
child
had
torn
him
from
his
saddle
and
doomed
him
to
disgrace
and
death
and
then
one
line
from
her
baby
lips
had
mounted
him
again
and
set
him
before
his
troopers
on
parade
was
when
daddy
came
through
the
woods
and
put
my
mamma
in
the
two
lives
she
had
held
in
her
little
hands
and
had
saved
them
both
with
a
dozen
words
of
simple
unfaltering
truth
on
the
dusty
pike
which
led
to
virginia
capital
another
rider
plodded
through
the
heat
and
haze
his
coat
once
gray
now
hung
in
tatters
about
his
form
but
beneath
his
battered
campaign
hat
his
thin
pale
features
were
smoothed
by
a
smile
of
happiness
behind
his
saddle
one
hand
gripped
tightly
in
a
rent
in
the
soiled
gray
coat
sat
still
another
rebel
the
smallest
of
them
all
her
tiny
legs
stretched
out
almost
straight
on
the
horse
wide
fat
back
daddy
how
far
is
it
to
richmon
now
the
rider
turned
his
head
and
pointed
north
it
close
now
honey
see
that
line
of
hills
that
richmond
a
mile
or
two
and
we
be
at
home
again
they
plodded
on
past
fields
of
shriveled
corn
whose
stalks
stood
silently
in
parched
and
wilted
lines
lines
that
were
like
the
ranks
of
the
doomed
confederacy
its
stalks
erect
yet
sapped
of
the
juice
of
life
where
orchards
once
had
flourished
their
rotted
branches
now
hid
mouths
of
rifle
pits
and
low
red
clay
entrenchments
stretched
across
the
fields
daddy
broke
out
a
piping
voice
do
you
think
we
better
make
this
yankee
horse
get
up
a
little
somethin
might
happen
before
we
get
there
it
all
right
virgie
her
father
answered
with
a
pat
on
her
small
brown
knee
these
lines
are
ours
and
i
reckon
we
are
safe
at
last
they
were
two
rebels
on
a
yankee
horse
soon
made
their
triumphant
entry
into
richmond
they
passed
through
rockets
by
the
wharves
on
the
river
bank
where
a
crippled
gunboat
lay
then
clattered
over
the
cobble
stones
up
main
street
till
they
reached
the
square
on
the
state
house
the
stars
and
bars
still
floated
but
the
travelers
did
not
pause
northward
they
turned
then
westward
again
till
they
stopped
at
last
before
a
silent
stately
mansion
the
headquarters
of
their
general
general
lee
before
the
open
door
two
sentries
stood
but
as
cary
and
his
charge
dismounted
an
orderly
came
down
the
steps
and
out
of
the
iron
gate
a
word
or
two
from
cary
and
the
orderly
disappeared
into
the
house
returning
soon
with
word
that
the
visitors
would
be
received
at
once
up
the
stone
steps
went
virgie
holding
tightly
to
her
father
hand
for
now
as
she
neared
her
general
her
little
heart
was
pounding
and
her
breath
came
eagerly
and
fast
on
the
threshold
of
a
dim
and
shaded
room
they
paused
and
looked
he
sat
there
at
a
table
strewn
with
war
maps
and
reports
a
tall
gray
man
in
a
coat
of
gray
the
soldier
and
the
gentleman
as
father
and
child
came
in
he
rose
to
meet
them
looking
at
the
two
with
eyes
that
seemed
to
hold
the
sadness
and
the
tenderness
of
all
the
world
he
knew
their
story
in
fact
he
had
bent
his
every
effort
to
the
saving
of
cary
life
he
had
sent
a
courier
to
the
camp
of
general
grant
below
the
city
asking
a
stay
of
sentence
till
the
facts
in
the
case
were
cleared
and
only
a
half
hour
before
his
courier
had
returned
with
news
of
the
prisoner
release
and
now
as
he
advanced
and
gave
a
courtly
welcome
to
his
trusted
scout
the
hand
of
the
littlest
rebel
once
more
went
up
in
salute
to
a
superior
officer
she
said
as
she
stole
a
glance
at
her
father
smiling
face
i
brought
him
back
with
with
the
pass
you
gave
me
sir
and
the
general
stooped
six
feet
of
him
till
his
lips
were
on
a
level
with
virgie
lips
then
folded
her
closely
into
his
great
gray
arms
the
end
peace
hushed
is
the
rolling
drum
the
bugle
note
breathes
but
an
echo
of
its
martial
blast
the
proud
old
flags
in
mourning
silence
float
above
the
heroes
of
a
buried
past
frail
ivy
vines
rusting
cannon
creep
the
tattered
pennants
droop
against
the
wall
the
warriors
are
sunk
in
sleep
beyond
a
summons
of
the
trumpet
call
do
ye
still
dream
ye
voiceless
slumbering
ones
of
glories
gained
through
struggles
fierce
and
long
lulled
by
the
muffled
boom
of
ghostly
guns
that
weave
the
music
of
a
in
fitful
flight
do
misty
visions
reel
while
restless
chargers
toss
their
when
down
the
lines
gleam
points
of
polished
steel
and
phantom
columns
flood
the
plains
a
breathless
hush
a
shout
that
mounts
on
high
till
every
hoary
hill
from
sleep
awakes
swift
as
the
unleashed
lightning
cleaves
the
sky
the
tumbling
of
battle
breaks
the
cannon
launch
their
shells
the
rattling
crash
of
musketry
sharp
sound
sinks
in
the
deafening
din
of
hoarse
wild
yells
and
squadrons
charging
the
trampled
ground
down
down
they
rush
the
cursing
riders
reel
tearing
shot
and
savage
a
plunging
charger
stamps
with
iron
heel
his
dying
master
in
the
battle
dust
the
notes
of
victory
awake
the
black
guns
thunder
back
the
shout
amain
in
waves
the
columns
break
like
shattered
foam
across
the
plain
a
still
form
lies
upon
the
hill
with
sightless
eyes
gray
lips
that
may
not
speak
his
dead
hand
holds
his
banner
still
its
proud
folds
pressed
against
his
bloodstained
cheek
o
slumbering
heroes
cease
to
dream
of
war
let
hatreds
die
behind
the
tread
of
years
forget
the
past
like
some
scar
whose
smart
is
healed
in
drops
of
falling
tears
keep
keep
your
glory
but
forget
the
strife
roll
up
your
so
stained
and
torn
teach
teach
our
hearts
that
still
dream
on
in
life
to
let
the
dead
past
sleep
with
those
we
mourn
from
pitying
heaven
a
pitying
angel
came
smiling
she
bade
the
tongues
of
conflict
cease
her
wide
wings
fanned
away
the
smoke
and
flame
hushed
the
red
battle
roar
god
called
her
peace
from
land
and
sea
she
swept
mad
passion
glow
yet
left
a
laurel
for
the
hero
fame
she
whispered
hope
to
hearts
in
grief
bowed
low
and
taught
our
lips
in
love
to
shape
her
name
she
sheathed
the
dripping
sword
her
soft
hands
grim
foes
apart
who
scowled
in
anger
deep
she
laid
two
grand
old
standards
down
to
rest
and
on
her
breast
rocked
weary
war
to
sleep
peace
spreads
her
pinions
wide
from
south
to
north
dead
enmity
within
the
grave
is
laid
the
church
towers
ring
their
holy
anthems
forth
to
hush
the
thunders
of
the
cannonade
