la
me
to
crave
your
acceptance
of
the
following
work
as
a
respectful
tribute
of
my
felt
some
hesitation
in
offering
it
for
its
main
incident
can
not
be
deemed
altogether
proper
but
i
have
striven
that
in
its
expression
at
least
it
should
not
sin
against
good
taste
and
i
trust
that
my
endeavours
have
been
is
the
diary
of
a
summer
of
my
life
in
which
i
have
changed
nothing
not
even
the
dates
thinking
as
i
do
that
in
our
efforts
arrange
we
often
only
succeed
in
disarranging
them
although
the
most
important
rôle
may
appear
to
devolve
on
madame
chrysantheme
it
is
very
certain
that
the
three
principal
personages
myself
japan
the
effect
produced
on
me
by
that
you
remember
a
certain
ridiculous
i
must
that
big
fellow
yves
a
japanese
girl
and
myself
grouped
closely
together
as
we
were
placed
side
by
side
by
a
nagasaki
artist
you
smiled
when
i
assured
you
that
the
carefully
combed
little
creature
placed
between
us
two
had
one
of
our
neighbours
welcome
my
book
with
the
same
indulgent
smile
without
seeking
therein
a
meaning
either
good
or
bad
in
the
same
spirit
that
you
would
receive
some
quaint
bit
of
pottery
some
grotesquely
carved
ivory
idol
or
some
preposterous
trifle
brought
back
for
you
from
this
singular
fatherland
of
all
me
with
the
deepest
respect
madame
la

pierre
loti
introduction
at
sea
about
two
in
the
morning
on
a
clear
night
under
a
sky
yves
stood
near
me
on
the
bridge
and
we
were
talking
of
the
country
so
utterly
unknown
to
us
both
to
which
the
chances
of
our
destiny
were
now
wafting
us
as
we
were
to
cast
anchor
the
following
day
we
enjoyed
the
state
of
expectation
and
formed
a
thousand
plans
as
for
me
i
said
i
shall
at
once
marry
ah
returned
yves
with
the
indifferent
air
of
a
man
whom
nothing
can
surprise
yes
i
shall
choose
a
little
woman
with
black
hair
and
cat
eyes
she
must
be
pretty
not
much
bigger
than
a
doll
you
shall
have
a
room
in
our
house
a
little
paper
house
in
the
midst
of
green
gardens
prettily
shaded
we
shall
live
among
flowers
everything
around
us
shall
blossom
and
each
morning
our
dwelling
shall
be
filled
with
nosegays
nosegays
such
as
you
have
never
dreamt
of
yves
now
began
to
take
an
interest
in
these
plans
for
my
future
household
indeed
he
would
have
listened
with
as
much
confidence
if
i
had
manifested
the
intention
of
taking
temporary
vows
in
some
monastery
of
this
new
country
or
of
marrying
some
island
queen
and
shutting
myself
up
with
her
in
a
house
built
of
jade
in
the
middle
of
an
enchanted
lake
in
reality
i
had
quite
made
up
my
mind
to
carry
out
the
scheme
i
had
unfolded
to
him
yes
actually
led
on
by
ennui
and
solitude
i
had
gradually
arrived
at
dreaming
of
and
looking
forward
to
this
absurd
marriage
and
then
above
all
to
live
for
awhile
on
land
in
some
shady
nook
amid
trees
and
flowers
how
tempting
it
sounded
after
the
long
months
we
had
been
wasting
at
the
pescadores
hot
and
arid
islands
devoid
of
freshness
woods
or
streamlets
full
of
faint
odors
of
china
and
of
death
we
had
made
great
way
in
latitude
since
our
vessel
had
quitted
that
chinese
furnace
and
the
constellations
in
the
sky
had
undergone
a
series
of
rapid
changes
the
southern
cross
had
disappeared
at
the
same
time
as
the
other
austral
stars
and
the
great
bear
rising
on
the
horizon
was
almost
on
as
high
a
level
as
it
is
in
the
french
sky
the
fresh
evening
breeze
soothed
and
revived
us
bringing
back
to
us
the
memory
of
our
summer
night
watches
on
the
coast
of
brittany
what
a
distance
we
were
however
from
those
familiar
coasts
what
a
terrible
distance
madame
chrysantheme
madame
chrysantheme
i
at
dawn
of
day
we
sighted
japan
precisely
at
the
foretold
moment
japan
arose
before
us
afar
off
like
a
clear
and
distinct
dot
in
the
vast
sea
which
for
so
many
days
had
been
but
a
blank
space
at
first
we
saw
nothing
in
the
rising
sun
but
a
series
of
tiny
heights
the
foremost
portion
of
the
fukai
islands
soon
however
appeared
all
along
the
horizon
like
a
thick
cloud
a
dark
veil
over
the
waters
japan
itself
and
little
by
little
out
of
the
dense
shadow
arose
the
sharp
opaque
outlines
of
the
nagasaki
mountains
the
wind
was
dead
against
us
and
the
strong
breeze
which
steadily
increased
seemed
as
if
the
country
were
blowing
with
all
its
might
against
us
in
a
vain
effort
to
drive
us
away
from
its
shores
the
sea
the
rigging
the
vessel
itself
all
vibrated
and
quivered
as
if
with
emotion
ii
by
three
in
the
afternoon
all
these
objects
drew
close
to
us
so
close
indeed
that
they
overshadowed
us
by
their
rocky
masses
and
dense
green
thickets
we
now
entered
into
a
shady
kind
of
channel
enclosed
between
two
high
ranges
of
mountains
curiously
symmetrical
in
shape
like
stage
scenery
very
fine
though
unlike
nature
it
seemed
as
if
japan
opened
to
our
view
through
a
rent
which
thus
allowed
us
to
penetrate
into
her
very
heart
nagasaki
as
yet
unseen
must
be
at
the
extremity
of
this
long
and
curious
bay
all
around
us
was
admirably
green
the
strong
had
suddenly
fallen
and
was
succeeded
by
a
perfect
calm
the
atmosphere
now
very
warm
was
laden
with
the
perfume
of
flowers
in
the
valley
resounded
the
ceaseless
whirr
of
the
cicalas
answering
each
other
from
one
shore
to
another
the
mountains
reëchoed
with
innumerable
sounds
the
whole
country
seemed
to
vibrate
like
crystal
on
our
way
we
passed
among
myriads
of
japanese
junks
gliding
softly
wafted
by
imperceptible
breezes
on
the
unruffled
water
their
motion
could
scarcely
be
heard
and
their
white
sails
stretched
out
on
yards
fell
languidly
in
a
thousand
horizontal
folds
like
their
strangely
contorted
poops
rising
up
castlewise
in
the
air
reminding
one
of
the
towering
ships
of
the
middle
ages
in
the
midst
of
the
intense
greenery
of
this
wall
of
mountains
they
stood
out
with
a
snowy
whiteness
what
a
country
of
verdure
and
shade
is
japan
what
an
eden
beyond
us
at
sea
it
must
have
been
full
daylight
but
here
in
the
recesses
of
the
valley
we
already
felt
the
impression
of
evening
beneath
the
summits
in
full
sunlight
the
base
of
the
mountains
and
all
the
thickly
wooded
parts
near
the
water
edge
were
steeped
in
twilight
the
passing
junks
gleaming
white
against
the
background
of
dark
foliage
were
silently
and
dexterously
maneuvered
by
small
yellow
men
stark
naked
with
long
hair
piled
up
in
womanlike
fashion
on
their
heads
gradually
as
we
advanced
further
up
the
green
channel
the
perfumes
became
more
penetrating
and
the
monotonous
chirp
of
the
cicalas
swelled
out
like
an
orchestral
crescendo
above
us
on
the
luminous
sky
sharply
delineated
between
the
mountains
a
species
of
hawk
hovered
about
screaming
out
with
a
deep
human
voice
han
han
han
its
melancholy
call
lengthened
out
by
the
surrounding
echoes
all
this
fresh
and
luxurious
nature
bore
the
impress
of
a
peculiar
japanese
type
which
seemed
to
pervade
even
the
mountain
tops
and
consisted
as
it
were
in
an
untruthful
aspect
of
too
much
prettiness
the
trees
were
grouped
in
clusters
with
the
same
pretentious
grace
as
on
the
lacquered
trays
large
rocks
sprang
up
in
exaggerated
shapes
side
by
side
with
rounded
hillocks
all
the
incongruous
elements
of
landscape
were
grouped
together
as
though
it
were
an
artificial
creation
looking
intently
here
and
there
might
be
seen
often
built
in
counterscarp
on
the
very
brink
of
an
abyss
some
old
tiny
mysterious
pagoda
half
hidden
in
the
foliage
of
the
overhanging
trees
bringing
to
the
minds
of
new
arrivals
such
as
ourselves
the
sense
of
unfamiliarity
and
strangeness
and
the
feeling
that
in
this
country
the
spirits
the
sylvan
gods
the
antique
symbols
faithful
guardians
of
the
woods
and
forests
were
unknown
and
uncomprehended
when
nagasaki
rose
before
us
the
sight
that
greeted
our
eyes
was
disappointing
situated
at
the
foot
of
green
overhanging
mountains
it
looked
like
any
other
commonplace
town
in
front
of
it
lay
a
tangled
mass
of
vessels
carrying
all
the
flags
of
the
world
steamboats
just
as
in
any
other
port
with
dark
funnels
and
black
smoke
and
behind
them
quays
covered
with
factories
nothing
in
fact
was
wanting
in
the
way
of
ordinary
trivial
objects
some
day
when
man
shall
have
made
all
things
alike
the
earth
will
be
a
dull
tedious
and
we
shall
have
even
to
give
up
traveling
and
seeking
for
a
change
which
shall
no
longer
be
found
at
about
six
we
dropped
anchor
noisily
amid
the
mass
of
vessels
already
there
and
were
immediately
invaded
invaded
by
a
mercantile
bustling
comical
japan
which
rushed
upon
us
in
full
full
junks
like
a
rising
sea
little
men
and
little
women
coming
in
a
continuous
uninterrupted
stream
without
cries
without
squabbles
noiselessly
each
one
making
so
smiling
a
bow
that
it
was
impossible
to
be
angry
with
them
and
that
indeed
by
reflex
action
we
smiled
and
bowed
also
they
all
carried
on
their
backs
little
baskets
little
boxes
receptacles
of
every
shape
fitting
into
each
other
in
the
most
ingenious
manner
each
one
containing
several
others
and
multiplying
till
they
filled
up
everything
in
endless
number
from
these
they
drew
forth
all
manners
of
curious
and
unexpected
things
folding
screens
slippers
soap
lanterns
live
cicalas
chirping
in
little
cages
jewelry
tame
white
mice
turning
little
cardboard
mills
quaint
photographs
hot
soups
and
stews
in
bowls
ready
to
be
served
out
in
rations
to
the
crew
china
a
legion
of
vases
teapots
cups
little
pots
and
plates
in
one
moment
all
this
was
unpacked
spread
out
with
astounding
rapidity
and
a
certain
talent
for
arrangement
each
seller
squatting
hands
touching
feet
behind
his
fancy
ware
always
smiling
bending
low
with
the
most
engaging
bows
under
the
mass
of
these
things
the
deck
presented
the
appearance
of
an
immense
bazaar
the
sailors
very
much
amused
and
full
of
fun
walked
among
the
piles
taking
the
little
women
by
the
chin
buying
anything
and
everything
throwing
broadcast
their
white
dollars
but
good
gracious
how
ugly
mean
and
grotesque
all
those
folk
were
given
my
projects
of
marriage
i
began
to
feel
singularly
uneasy
and
disenchanted
yves
and
myself
were
on
duty
till
the
next
morning
and
after
the
first
bustle
which
always
takes
place
on
board
when
settling
down
in
harbor
boats
to
lower
booms
to
swing
out
running
rigging
to
make
taut
we
had
nothing
more
to
do
but
to
look
on
we
said
to
one
another
where
are
we
in
reality
in
the
united
states
in
some
english
colony
in
australia
or
in
new
zealand
consular
residences
offices
manufactories
a
dry
dock
in
which
a
russian
frigate
was
lying
on
the
heights
the
large
european
concession
sprinkled
with
villas
and
on
the
quays
american
bars
for
the
sailors
further
off
it
is
true
further
off
far
away
behind
these
objects
in
the
very
depths
of
the
immense
green
valley
peered
thousands
upon
thousands
of
tiny
black
houses
a
tangled
mass
of
curious
appearance
from
which
here
and
there
emerged
some
higher
dark
red
painted
roofs
probably
the
true
old
japanese
nagasaki
which
still
exists
and
in
those
quarters
who
knows
there
may
be
lurking
behind
a
paper
screen
some
affected
little
woman
whom
perhaps
in
two
or
three
days
having
no
time
to
lose
i
shall
marry
but
no
the
picture
painted
by
my
fancy
has
faded
i
can
no
longer
see
this
little
creature
in
my
mind
eye
the
sellers
of
the
white
mice
have
blurred
her
image
i
fear
now
lest
she
should
be
like
them
at
nightfall
the
decks
were
suddenly
cleared
as
by
enchantment
in
a
second
they
had
all
shut
up
their
boxes
folded
their
sliding
screens
their
trick
fans
and
humbly
bowing
to
each
of
us
the
little
men
and
little
women
disappeared
slowly
as
the
shades
of
night
closed
around
us
mingling
all
things
in
the
bluish
darkness
this
japan
surrounding
us
became
once
more
by
degrees
little
by
little
a
and
enchanted
country
the
great
mountains
now
all
black
were
mirrored
and
doubled
in
the
still
water
at
their
feet
on
which
we
floated
reflecting
therein
their
sharply
reversed
outlines
and
presenting
the
mirage
of
fearful
precipices
over
which
we
hung
the
stars
also
were
reversed
in
their
order
making
in
the
depths
of
the
imaginary
abyss
a
sprinkling
of
tiny
phosphorescent
lights
then
all
nagasaki
became
profusely
illuminated
covering
itself
with
multitudes
of
lanterns
the
smallest
suburb
the
smallest
village
was
lit
up
the
tiniest
hut
perched
up
on
high
among
the
trees
and
which
in
the
daytime
was
invisible
threw
out
its
little
glimmer
soon
there
were
numberless
lights
all
over
the
country
on
all
the
shores
of
the
bay
from
top
to
bottom
of
the
mountains
myriads
of
glowing
fires
shone
out
in
the
darkness
conveying
the
impression
of
a
vast
capital
rising
up
around
us
in
one
bewildering
amphitheater
beneath
in
the
silent
waters
another
town
also
illuminated
seemed
to
descend
into
the
depths
of
the
abyss
the
night
was
balmy
pure
delicious
the
atmosphere
laden
with
the
perfume
of
flowers
came
wafted
to
us
from
the
mountains
from
the
tea
houses
and
other
nocturnal
resorts
the
sound
of
guitars
reached
our
ears
seeming
in
the
distance
the
sweetest
of
music
and
the
whirr
of
the
cicalas
which
in
japan
is
one
of
the
continuous
noises
of
life
and
which
in
a
few
days
we
shall
no
longer
even
be
aware
of
so
completely
is
it
the
background
and
foundation
of
all
the
other
terrestrial
sounds
was
sonorous
incessant
softly
monotonous
just
like
the
cascade
of
a
crystal
waterfall
iii
the
next
day
the
rain
came
down
in
torrents
a
regular
downpour
merciless
and
unceasing
blinding
and
drenching
everything
a
thick
rain
so
dense
that
it
was
impossible
to
see
through
it
from
one
end
of
the
vessel
to
the
other
it
seemed
as
though
the
clouds
of
the
whole
world
had
amassed
themselves
in
nagasaki
bay
and
had
chosen
this
great
green
funnel
to
stream
down
to
their
hearts
content
and
it
rained
it
rained
it
became
almost
as
dark
as
night
so
thickly
did
the
rain
fall
through
a
veil
of
crumbled
water
we
still
perceived
the
base
of
the
mountains
but
the
summits
were
lost
to
sight
among
the
great
somber
masses
weighing
down
upon
us
above
us
shreds
of
clouds
seemingly
torn
from
the
dark
vault
draggled
across
the
trees
like
vast
gray
rags
continually
melting
away
in
water
torrents
of
water
there
was
wind
too
and
it
howled
through
the
ravines
with
a
tone
the
whole
surface
of
the
bay
bespattered
by
the
rain
flogged
by
the
gusts
of
wind
that
blew
from
all
quarters
splashed
moaned
and
seethed
in
violent
agitation
what
wretched
weather
for
a
first
landing
and
how
was
i
to
find
a
wife
through
such
a
deluge
in
an
unknown
country
no
matter
i
dressed
myself
and
said
to
yves
who
smiled
at
my
obstinate
determination
in
spite
of
unfavorable
circumstances
hail
me
a
brother
please
yves
then
by
a
motion
of
his
arm
through
the
wind
and
rain
summoned
a
kind
of
little
white
wooden
sarcophagus
which
was
skipping
near
us
on
the
waves
sculled
by
a
couple
of
yellow
boys
stark
naked
in
the
rain
the
craft
approached
us
i
jumped
into
it
then
through
a
little
shaped
like
a
that
one
of
the
scullers
throws
open
for
me
i
slipped
in
and
stretched
myself
at
full
length
on
a
mat
in
what
is
called
the
cabin
of
a
sampan
there
was
just
room
enough
for
my
body
to
lie
in
this
floating
coffin
which
is
moreover
scrupulously
clean
white
with
the
whiteness
of
new
deal
boards
i
was
well
sheltered
from
the
rain
that
fell
pattering
on
my
lid
and
thus
i
started
off
for
the
town
lying
in
this
box
flat
on
my
stomach
rocked
by
one
wave
roughly
shaken
by
another
at
moments
almost
and
through
the
door
of
my
i
saw
upside
down
the
two
little
creatures
to
whom
i
had
entrusted
my
fate
children
of
eight
or
ten
years
of
age
at
the
most
who
with
little
monkeyish
faces
had
however
fully
developed
muscles
like
miniature
men
and
were
already
as
skillful
as
any
regular
old
salts
they
began
to
shout
no
doubt
we
were
approaching
the
and
indeed
through
my
which
i
had
now
thrown
wide
open
i
saw
quite
near
to
me
the
gray
on
the
quays
i
got
out
of
my
sarcophagus
and
prepared
to
set
foot
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
on
japanese
soil
all
was
streaming
around
us
and
the
irritating
tiresome
rain
dashed
into
my
eyes
no
sooner
had
i
landed
than
there
bounded
towards
me
about
a
dozen
strange
beings
of
what
description
it
was
almost
impossible
to
make
out
through
the
blinding
showers
a
species
of
human
each
dragging
some
large
black
thing
they
came
screaming
around
me
and
stopped
my
progress
one
of
them
opened
and
held
over
my
head
an
enormous
umbrella
decorated
on
its
transparent
surface
with
paintings
of
storks
and
they
all
smiled
at
me
in
an
engaging
manner
with
an
air
of
expectation
i
had
been
forewarned
these
were
only
the
who
were
touting
for
the
honor
of
my
preference
nevertheless
i
was
startled
at
this
sudden
attack
this
japanese
welcome
on
a
first
visit
to
land
the
or
are
the
runners
who
drag
little
carts
and
are
paid
for
conveying
people
to
and
fro
being
hired
by
the
hour
or
the
distance
as
cabs
are
with
us
their
legs
were
naked
they
were
very
wet
and
their
heads
were
hidden
under
large
shady
conical
hats
by
way
of
waterproofs
they
wore
nothing
less
than
mats
of
straw
with
all
the
ends
of
the
straws
turned
outwards
bristling
like
porcupines
they
seemed
clothed
in
a
thatched
roof
they
went
on
smiling
awaiting
my
choice
not
having
the
honor
of
being
acquainted
with
any
of
them
in
particular
i
choose
at
haphazard
the
djin
with
the
umbrella
and
get
into
his
little
cart
of
which
he
carefully
lowers
the
hood
he
draws
an
apron
over
my
knees
pulling
it
up
to
my
face
and
then
advancing
near
asks
me
in
japanese
something
which
must
have
meant
where
to
sir
to
which
i
reply
in
the
same
language
to
the
of
my
friend
i
said
this
in
the
three
words
i
had
learnt
by
heart
astonished
that
such
sounds
could
mean
anything
astonished
too
at
their
being
understood
we
started
off
he
running
at
full
speed
i
dragged
along
by
him
jerked
about
in
his
light
chariot
wrapped
in
oiled
cloth
shut
up
as
if
in
a
box
both
of
us
unceasingly
drenched
all
the
while
and
dashing
all
around
us
the
water
and
mud
of
the
sodden
ground
to
the
of
i
had
said
like
an
habitual
frequenter
of
the
place
and
quite
surprised
at
hearing
myself
speak
but
i
was
less
ignorant
about
japan
than
might
have
been
supposed
many
of
my
friends
had
on
their
return
home
from
that
country
told
me
about
it
and
i
knew
a
great
deal
the
of
is
a
an
elegant
rendezvous
there
i
would
inquire
for
a
certain
who
is
at
the
same
time
interpreter
washerman
and
confidential
agent
for
the
intercourse
of
races
perhaps
this
very
evening
if
all
went
well
i
should
be
introduced
to
the
bride
destined
to
me
by
mysterious
fate
this
thought
kept
my
mind
on
the
alert
during
the
panting
journey
we
have
been
making
the
djin
and
myself
one
dragging
the
other
under
the
merciless
downpour
oh
what
a
curious
japan
i
saw
that
day
through
the
gaping
of
my
coverings
from
under
the
dripping
hood
of
my
little
cart
a
sullen
muddy
japan
all
these
houses
men
or
beasts
hitherto
only
known
to
me
by
drawings
all
these
that
i
had
beheld
painted
on
blue
or
pink
backgrounds
of
fans
or
vases
now
appeared
to
me
in
their
hard
reality
under
a
dark
sky
with
umbrellas
and
wooden
shoes
with
skirts
and
pitiful
aspect
at
moments
the
rain
fell
so
heavily
that
i
tightly
closed
up
every
chink
and
crevice
and
the
noise
and
shaking
benumbed
me
so
that
i
completely
forgot
in
what
country
i
was
in
the
hood
of
the
cart
were
holes
through
which
little
streams
ran
down
my
back
then
remembering
that
i
was
going
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
through
the
very
heart
of
nagasaki
i
cast
an
inquiring
look
outside
at
the
risk
of
receiving
a
douche
we
were
trotting
along
through
a
mean
narrow
little
back
street
there
are
thousands
like
it
a
perfect
labyrinth
of
them
the
rain
falling
in
cascades
from
the
tops
of
the
roofs
on
the
gleaming
flagstones
below
rendering
everything
indistinct
and
vague
through
the
misty
atmosphere
at
times
we
passed
by
a
lady
struggling
with
her
skirts
unsteadily
tripping
along
in
her
high
wooden
shoes
looking
exactly
like
the
figures
painted
on
screens
tucked
up
under
a
gaudily
daubed
paper
umbrella
or
else
we
passed
a
pagoda
where
an
old
granite
monster
squatting
in
the
water
seemed
to
make
a
hideous
ferocious
grimace
at
me
how
immense
this
nagasaki
is
here
had
we
been
running
hard
for
the
last
hour
and
still
it
seemed
it
is
a
flat
plain
and
one
could
never
suppose
from
the
offing
that
so
vast
a
plain
could
lie
in
the
recesses
of
this
valley
it
would
however
have
been
impossible
for
me
to
say
where
i
was
or
in
what
direction
we
had
run
i
abandoned
my
fate
to
my
djin
and
to
my
good
luck
what
a
of
a
man
my
djin
was
i
had
been
accustomed
to
the
chinese
runners
but
they
were
nothing
by
the
side
of
this
fellow
when
i
part
my
to
peep
at
anything
he
is
naturally
always
the
first
object
in
my
foreground
his
two
naked
brown
muscular
legs
scampering
one
after
the
other
splashing
all
around
and
his
bristling
hedgehog
back
bending
low
in
the
rain
do
the
gazing
at
this
little
dripping
cart
guess
that
it
contains
a
suitor
in
quest
of
a
bride
at
last
my
vehicle
stops
and
my
djin
with
many
smiles
and
precautions
lest
any
fresh
rivers
should
stream
down
my
back
lowers
the
hood
of
the
cart
there
is
a
break
in
the
storm
and
the
rain
has
ceased
i
had
not
yet
seen
his
face
by
exception
to
the
general
rule
he
is
a
young
man
of
about
thirty
years
of
age
of
intelligent
and
strong
appearance
and
an
open
countenance
who
could
have
foreseen
that
a
few
days
later
this
very
but
no
i
will
not
anticipate
and
run
the
risk
of
throwing
beforehand
any
discredit
on
chrysanthème
we
had
therefore
reached
our
destination
and
found
ourselves
at
the
foot
of
a
tall
overhanging
mountain
probably
beyond
the
limits
of
the
town
in
some
suburban
district
it
apparently
became
necessary
to
continue
our
journey
on
foot
and
climb
up
an
almost
perpendicular
narrow
path
around
us
a
number
of
small
country
houses
garden
walls
and
high
bamboo
palisades
closed
in
the
view
the
green
hill
crushed
us
with
its
towering
height
the
heavy
dark
clouds
lowering
over
our
heads
seemed
like
a
leaden
canopy
confining
us
in
this
unknown
spot
it
really
seemed
as
though
the
complete
absence
of
perspective
inclined
one
all
the
better
to
notice
the
details
of
this
tiny
corner
muddy
and
wet
of
homely
japan
now
lying
before
our
eyes
the
earth
was
very
red
the
grasses
and
wild
flowers
bordering
the
pathway
were
strange
to
me
nevertheless
the
palings
were
covered
with
convolvuli
like
our
own
and
i
recognized
in
the
gardens
china
asters
zinnias
and
other
familiar
flowers
the
atmosphere
seemed
laden
with
a
curiously
complicated
odor
something
besides
the
perfume
of
the
plants
and
soil
arising
no
doubt
from
the
human
a
mingled
smell
i
fancied
of
dried
fish
and
incense
not
a
creature
was
to
be
seen
of
the
inhabitants
of
their
homes
and
life
there
was
not
a
vestige
and
i
might
have
imagined
myself
anywhere
in
the
world
my
djin
had
fastened
up
his
little
cart
under
a
tree
and
together
we
clambered
the
steep
path
on
the
slippery
red
soil
we
are
going
to
the
of
are
we
not
i
inquired
anxious
to
ascertain
if
i
had
been
understood
yes
yes
replied
the
djin
it
is
up
there
and
quite
near
the
road
turned
steep
banks
hemming
it
in
and
darkening
it
on
one
side
it
skirted
the
mountain
all
covered
with
a
tangle
of
wet
ferns
on
the
other
appeared
a
large
wooden
house
almost
devoid
of
apertures
and
of
evil
aspect
it
was
there
that
my
djin
halted
what
that
house
was
the
of
he
assured
me
that
it
was
and
seemed
very
sure
of
the
fact
we
knocked
at
a
big
door
which
opened
immediately
slipping
back
in
its
groove
then
two
funny
little
women
appeared
but
with
evident
pretensions
to
youth
exact
types
of
the
figures
painted
on
vases
with
their
baby
hands
and
feet
on
catching
sight
of
me
they
threw
themselves
on
all
fours
their
faces
touching
the
floor
good
gracious
what
can
be
the
matter
nothing
at
all
it
is
only
the
ceremonious
salute
to
which
i
am
as
yet
unaccustomed
they
rise
and
proceed
to
take
off
my
boots
one
never
keeps
on
one
shoes
in
a
japanese
house
wiping
the
bottom
of
my
trousers
and
feeling
my
shoulders
to
see
if
i
am
wet
what
always
strikes
one
on
first
entering
a
japanese
dwelling
is
the
extreme
cleanliness
and
white
and
chilling
bareness
of
the
rooms
over
the
most
irreproachable
mattings
without
a
crease
a
line
or
a
stain
i
am
led
upstairs
to
the
first
story
and
ushered
into
a
big
empty
room
absolutely
empty
the
paper
walls
are
mounted
on
sliding
panels
which
fitting
into
each
other
can
be
made
to
disappear
entirely
and
all
one
side
of
the
apartment
opens
like
a
verandah
on
to
the
green
country
and
the
gray
sky
beyond
by
way
of
a
chair
i
am
given
a
square
piece
of
black
velvet
and
behold
me
seated
low
in
the
middle
of
this
large
empty
room
which
by
its
very
vastness
is
almost
chilly
the
two
little
women
who
are
the
servants
of
the
house
and
my
very
humble
servants
too
await
my
orders
in
attitudes
expressive
of
the
profoundest
humility
it
seemed
extraordinary
that
the
quaint
words
the
curious
phrases
i
had
learnt
during
our
exile
at
the
pescadores
islands
by
sheer
dint
of
dictionary
and
grammar
book
without
attaching
the
least
sense
to
them
should
mean
anything
but
so
it
seemed
however
for
i
was
at
once
understood
i
wish
in
the
first
place
to
speak
to
one
kangourou
who
is
interpreter
washerman
and
matrimonial
agent
nothing
could
be
better
they
know
him
and
will
go
at
once
in
search
of
him
and
the
elder
of
the
gets
ready
for
the
purpose
her
wooden
clogs
and
her
paper
umbrella
next
i
demand
a
repast
composed
of
the
greatest
delicacies
of
japan
better
and
better
they
rush
to
the
kitchen
to
order
it
finally
i
beg
they
will
give
tea
and
rice
to
my
djin
who
is
waiting
for
me
below
i
wish
in
short
i
wish
many
things
my
dear
little
dollies
which
i
will
mention
by
degrees
and
with
due
deliberation
when
i
shall
have
had
time
to
assemble
the
necessary
words
but
the
more
i
look
at
you
the
more
uneasy
i
feel
as
to
what
my
of
may
be
like
almost
pretty
i
grant
you
you
are
in
virtue
of
quaintness
delicate
hands
miniature
feet
but
ugly
after
all
and
absurdly
small
you
look
like
ouistitis
like
little
china
ornaments
like
i
do
know
what
i
begin
to
understand
that
i
have
arrived
at
this
house
at
an
moment
something
is
going
on
which
does
not
concern
me
and
i
feel
that
i
am
in
the
way
from
the
beginning
i
might
have
guessed
as
much
notwithstanding
the
excessive
politeness
of
my
welcome
for
i
remember
now
that
while
they
were
taking
off
my
boots
downstairs
i
heard
a
murmuring
chatter
overhead
then
a
noise
of
panels
moved
quickly
along
their
grooves
evidently
to
hide
from
me
something
i
was
not
intended
to
see
they
were
improvising
for
me
the
apartment
in
which
i
now
am
just
as
in
menageries
they
make
a
separate
compartment
for
some
beasts
when
the
public
is
admitted
now
i
am
left
alone
while
my
orders
are
being
executed
and
i
listen
attentively
squatted
like
a
buddha
on
my
black
velvet
cushion
in
the
midst
of
the
whiteness
of
the
walls
and
mats
behind
the
paper
partitions
voices
seemingly
numerous
are
talking
in
low
tones
then
rises
the
sound
of
a
guitar
and
the
song
of
a
woman
plaintive
and
gentle
in
the
echoing
sonority
of
the
bare
house
in
the
melancholy
of
the
rainy
weather
what
one
can
see
through
the
verandah
is
very
pretty
i
will
admit
it
resembles
the
landscape
of
a
fairy
tale
there
are
admirably
wooded
mountains
climbing
high
into
the
dark
and
gloomy
sky
and
hiding
in
it
the
peaks
of
their
summits
and
perched
up
among
the
clouds
a
temple
the
atmosphere
has
that
absolute
transparency
the
distance
that
clearness
which
follows
a
great
downpour
of
rain
but
a
thick
pall
still
heavy
with
moisture
remains
suspended
over
all
and
on
the
foliage
of
the
hanging
woods
still
float
great
flakes
of
gray
fluff
which
remain
there
motionless
in
the
foreground
in
front
of
and
below
all
this
almost
fantastic
landscape
is
a
miniature
garden
where
two
beautiful
white
cats
are
taking
the
air
amusing
themselves
by
pursuing
each
other
through
the
paths
of
a
lilliputian
labyrinth
shaking
from
their
paws
the
sand
which
is
still
wet
the
garden
is
as
conventional
as
possible
not
a
flower
but
little
rocks
little
lakes
dwarf
trees
cut
in
a
grotesque
fashion
all
this
is
not
natural
but
it
is
most
ingeniously
arranged
so
green
so
full
of
fresh
mosses
in
the
country
below
me
to
the
very
furthest
end
of
the
vast
scene
reigns
a
great
silence
an
absolute
calm
but
the
voice
behind
the
paper
wall
continues
to
sing
in
a
key
of
gentle
sadness
and
the
accompanying
guitar
has
somber
and
even
gloomy
notes
stay
though
now
the
music
is
somewhat
quicker
one
might
even
suppose
they
were
dancing
so
much
the
worse
i
shall
try
to
look
between
the
fragile
divisions
through
a
crack
which
has
revealed
itself
to
my
notice
what
a
singular
spectacle
it
is
evidently
the
gilded
youth
of
nagasaki
holding
a
great
clandestine
orgy
in
an
apartment
as
bare
as
my
own
there
are
a
dozen
of
them
seated
in
a
circle
on
the
ground
attired
in
long
blue
cotton
dresses
with
pagoda
sleeves
long
sleek
and
greasy
hair
surmounted
by
european
pot
hats
and
beneath
these
yellow
worn
out
bloodless
foolish
faces
on
the
floor
are
a
number
of
little
little
pipes
little
lacquer
trays
little
little
cups
all
the
accessories
and
all
the
remains
of
a
japanese
feast
resembling
nothing
so
much
as
a
doll
in
the
midst
of
this
circle
of
dandies
are
three
women
one
might
say
three
weird
visions
robed
in
garments
of
pale
and
undefinable
colors
embroidered
with
golden
monsters
and
their
great
chignons
arranged
with
fantastic
art
stuck
full
of
pins
and
flowers
two
are
seated
and
turn
their
back
to
me
one
is
holding
the
guitar
the
other
singing
with
that
soft
and
pretty
voice
thus
seen
furtively
from
behind
their
pose
their
hair
the
nape
of
the
neck
all
is
exquisite
and
i
tremble
lest
a
movement
should
reveal
to
me
faces
which
might
destroy
the
enchantment
the
third
one
is
on
her
feet
dancing
before
this
areopagus
of
idiots
with
their
lanky
locks
and
pot
hats
what
a
shock
when
she
turns
round
she
wears
over
her
face
the
horribly
grinning
deathly
mask
of
a
specter
or
vampire
the
mask
unfastened
falls
and
behold
a
darling
little
fairy
of
about
twelve
or
fifteen
years
of
age
slim
and
already
a
coquette
already
a
woman
dressed
in
a
long
robe
of
shaded
dark
blue
china
crape
covered
with
embroidery
representing
bats
gray
bats
black
bats
golden
bats
suddenly
there
are
steps
on
the
stairs
the
light
footsteps
of
barefooted
women
pattering
over
the
white
mats
no
doubt
the
first
course
of
my
lunch
just
about
to
be
served
i
quickly
fall
back
fixed
and
motionless
upon
my
black
velvet
cushion
there
are
three
of
them
now
three
who
arrive
in
single
file
with
smiles
and
curtsies
one
offers
me
the
and
the
another
preserved
fruits
in
delightful
little
plates
the
third
absolutely
indefinable
objects
upon
gems
of
little
trays
and
they
grovel
before
me
on
the
floor
placing
all
this
plaything
of
a
meal
at
my
feet
at
this
moment
my
impressions
of
japan
are
charming
enough
i
feel
myself
fairly
launched
upon
this
tiny
artificial
fictitious
world
which
i
felt
i
knew
already
from
the
paintings
of
lacquer
and
porcelains
it
is
so
exact
a
representation
the
three
little
squatting
women
graceful
and
dainty
with
their
narrow
slits
of
eyes
their
magnificent
chignons
in
huge
bows
smooth
and
shining
as
and
the
little
on
the
floor
the
landscape
seen
through
the
verandah
the
pagoda
perched
among
the
clouds
and
over
all
the
same
affectation
everywhere
in
every
detail
even
the
woman
melancholy
voice
still
to
be
heard
behind
the
paper
partition
was
so
evidently
the
way
they
should
sing
these
musicians
i
had
so
often
seen
painted
in
amazing
colors
on
half
closing
their
dreamy
eyes
in
the
midst
of
impossibly
large
flowers
long
before
i
came
to
it
i
had
perfectly
pictured
this
japan
to
myself
nevertheless
in
the
reality
it
almost
seems
to
be
smaller
more
finicking
than
i
had
imagined
it
and
also
much
more
mournful
no
doubt
by
reason
of
that
great
pall
of
black
clouds
hanging
over
us
and
this
incessant
rain
while
awaiting
kangourou
who
is
dressing
himself
it
appears
and
will
be
here
shortly
it
may
be
as
well
to
begin
lunch
in
the
daintiest
bowl
imaginable
adorned
with
flights
of
storks
is
the
most
wildly
impossible
soup
made
of
after
which
there
are
little
fish
dried
in
sugar
crabs
in
sugar
beans
in
sugar
and
fruits
in
vinegar
and
pepper
all
this
is
atrocious
but
above
all
unexpected
and
unimaginable
the
little
women
make
me
eat
laughing
much
with
that
perpetual
irritating
laugh
which
is
the
laugh
peculiar
to
japan
they
make
me
eat
according
to
their
fashion
with
dainty
fingered
with
mannered
grace
i
am
becoming
accustomed
to
their
faces
the
whole
effect
is
refined
a
refinement
so
utterly
different
from
our
own
that
at
first
sight
i
understand
nothing
of
it
although
in
the
long
run
it
may
end
by
pleasing
me
suddenly
there
enters
like
a
night
butterfly
awakened
in
broad
daylight
like
a
rare
and
surprising
moth
the
from
the
other
compartment
the
child
who
wore
the
horrible
mask
no
doubt
she
wishes
to
have
a
look
at
me
she
rolls
her
eyes
like
a
timid
kitten
and
then
all
at
once
tamed
nestles
against
me
with
a
coaxing
air
of
childishness
which
is
a
delightfully
transparent
assumption
she
is
slim
elegant
delicate
and
smells
sweet
drolly
painted
white
as
plaster
with
a
little
circle
of
rouge
marked
very
precisely
in
the
middle
of
each
cheek
the
mouth
reddened
and
a
touch
of
gilding
outlining
the
under
lip
as
they
could
not
whiten
the
back
of
the
neck
on
account
of
all
the
delicate
little
curls
of
hair
growing
there
they
had
in
their
love
of
exactitude
stopped
the
white
plaster
in
a
straight
line
which
might
have
been
cut
with
a
knife
and
in
consequence
at
the
nape
appears
a
square
of
natural
skin
of
a
deep
yellow
an
imperious
note
sounds
on
the
guitar
evidently
a
summons
crac
away
she
goes
the
little
fairy
to
rejoice
the
drivelling
fools
on
the
other
side
of
the
screens
supposing
i
marry
this
one
without
seeking
any
further
i
should
respect
her
as
a
child
committed
to
my
care
i
should
take
her
for
what
she
is
a
fantastic
and
charming
plaything
what
an
amusing
little
household
i
should
set
up
really
short
of
marrying
a
china
ornament
i
should
find
it
difficult
to
choose
better
at
this
moment
enters
kangourou
clad
in
a
suit
of
gray
tweed
which
might
have
come
from
belle
or
the
with
a
pot
hat
and
white
thread
gloves
his
countenance
is
at
once
foolish
and
cunning
he
has
hardly
a
nose
hardly
any
eyes
he
makes
a
real
japanese
salutation
an
abrupt
dip
the
hands
placed
flat
on
the
knees
the
body
making
a
right
angle
to
the
legs
as
if
the
fellow
were
breaking
in
two
a
little
hissing
produced
by
sucking
the
saliva
between
the
teeth
and
which
is
the
expression
plus
of
obsequious
politeness
in
this
country
you
speak
french
m
kangourou
sir
renewed
bows
he
makes
one
for
each
word
i
utter
as
if
he
were
a
mechanical
toy
pulled
by
a
string
when
he
is
seated
before
me
on
the
ground
he
limits
himself
to
a
duck
of
the
head
always
accompanied
by
the
same
hissing
noise
of
the
saliva
a
cup
of
tea
m
kangourou
fresh
salute
and
an
extra
affected
gesticulation
with
the
hands
as
if
to
say
i
should
hardly
dare
it
is
too
great
a
condescension
on
your
part
however
anything
to
oblige
you
he
guesses
at
the
first
words
what
i
require
from
him
of
course
he
replies
we
will
see
about
it
at
once
in
a
time
as
it
happens
a
family
from
simonosaki
in
which
there
are
two
charming
daughters
will
be
here
what
in
a
week
you
do
know
me
kangourou
no
no
either
now
or
not
at
all
again
a
hissing
bow
and
catching
my
agitation
begins
to
pass
in
feverish
review
all
the
young
persons
at
his
disposal
in
nagasaki
let
us
see
there
was
mdlle
œillet
what
a
pity
that
i
had
not
spoken
a
few
days
sooner
so
pretty
so
clever
at
playing
the
guitar
it
is
an
irreparable
misfortune
she
was
engaged
only
yesterday
by
a
russian
officer
ah
mdlle
abricot
would
she
suit
me
mdlle
abricot
she
is
the
daughter
of
a
wealthy
china
merchant
in
the
decima
bazaar
a
person
of
the
highest
merit
but
she
would
be
very
dear
her
parents
who
think
a
great
deal
of
her
will
not
let
her
go
under
a
hundred
yen
a
a
month
she
is
very
accomplished
thoroughly
understands
commercial
writings
and
has
at
her
finger
ends
more
than
two
thousand
characters
of
learned
writing
in
a
poetical
competition
she
gained
the
first
prize
with
a
sonnet
composed
in
praise
of
blossoms
of
the
hedges
seen
in
the
dew
of
early
morning
only
she
is
not
very
pretty
one
of
her
eyes
is
smaller
than
the
other
and
she
has
a
hole
in
her
cheek
resulting
from
an
illness
of
her
childhood
footnote
a
a
yen
is
equal
to
four
shillings
oh
no
on
no
account
that
one
let
us
seek
amongst
a
less
distinguished
class
of
young
persons
but
without
scars
and
how
about
those
on
the
other
side
of
the
screen
in
those
fine
dresses
for
instance
the
dancer
with
the
specter
mask
kangourou
or
again
she
who
sings
in
so
dulcet
a
strain
and
has
such
a
charming
nape
to
her
neck
he
does
not
at
first
understand
my
drift
then
when
he
gathers
my
meaning
he
shakes
his
head
almost
in
a
joking
way
and
says
no
sir
no
those
are
only
b
sir
footnote
b
are
professional
dancers
and
singers
trained
at
the
yeddo
conservatory
well
but
why
not
a
what
odds
can
it
be
to
me
whether
they
are
or
not
later
on
no
doubt
when
i
understand
japanese
affairs
better
i
shall
appreciate
myself
the
enormity
of
my
proposal
one
would
really
suppose
i
had
talked
of
marrying
the
devil
at
this
point
kangourou
suddenly
calls
to
mind
one
mdlle
jasmin
heavens
how
was
it
he
did
not
think
of
her
at
once
she
is
absolutely
and
exactly
what
i
want
he
will
go
or
this
very
evening
to
make
the
necessary
overtures
to
the
parents
of
this
young
person
who
live
a
long
way
off
on
the
opposite
hill
in
the
suburb
of
she
is
a
very
pretty
girl
of
about
fifteen
she
can
probably
be
engaged
for
about
eighteen
or
twenty
dollars
a
month
on
condition
of
presenting
her
with
a
few
dresses
of
the
best
fashion
and
of
lodging
her
in
a
pleasant
and
house
all
of
which
a
man
of
gallantry
like
myself
could
not
fail
to
do
well
let
us
fix
upon
mdlle
jasmin
then
and
now
we
must
part
time
presses
kangourou
will
come
on
board
to
communicate
to
me
the
result
of
his
first
proceedings
and
to
arrange
with
me
for
the
interview
for
the
present
he
refuses
to
accept
any
remuneration
but
i
am
to
give
him
my
washing
and
to
procure
him
the
custom
of
my
brother
officers
of
the
it
is
all
settled
profound
bows
they
put
on
my
boots
again
at
the
door
my
djin
profiting
by
the
interpreter
kind
fortune
has
placed
in
his
way
begs
to
be
recommended
to
me
for
future
custom
his
stand
is
on
the
quay
his
number
is
inscribed
in
french
characters
on
the
lantern
of
his
vehicle
we
have
a
number
on
board
one
le
goëlec
gunner
who
serves
the
left
of
one
of
my
guns
happy
thought
i
shall
remember
this
his
price
is
sixpence
the
journey
or
five
pence
an
hour
for
his
customers
capital
he
shall
have
my
custom
that
is
promised
and
now
let
us
be
off
the
who
have
escorted
me
to
the
door
fall
on
all
fours
as
a
final
salute
and
remain
prostrate
on
the
threshold
as
long
as
i
am
still
in
sight
down
the
dark
pathway
where
the
rain
trickles
off
the
great
bracken
upon
my
head
iv
three
days
have
passed
night
is
closing
in
an
apartment
which
has
been
mine
since
yesterday
yves
and
i
on
the
first
floor
move
restlessly
over
the
white
mats
striding
up
and
down
the
great
bare
room
of
which
the
thin
dry
flooring
cracks
beneath
our
footsteps
we
are
both
of
us
rather
irritated
by
prolonged
expectation
yves
whose
impatience
shows
itself
the
most
freely
from
time
to
time
takes
a
look
out
of
the
window
as
for
myself
a
chill
suddenly
seizes
me
at
the
idea
that
i
have
chosen
and
purpose
to
inhabit
this
lonely
house
lost
in
the
midst
of
the
suburb
of
a
totally
strange
town
perched
high
on
the
mountain
and
almost
opening
upon
the
woods
what
wild
notion
can
have
taken
possession
of
me
to
settle
myself
in
surroundings
so
utterly
foreign
and
unknown
breathing
of
isolation
and
sadness
the
waiting
unnerves
me
and
i
beguile
the
time
by
examining
all
the
little
details
of
the
building
the
woodwork
of
the
ceiling
is
complicated
and
ingenious
on
the
partitions
of
white
paper
which
form
the
walls
are
scattered
tiny
microscopic
tortoises
they
are
late
said
yves
who
is
still
looking
out
into
the
street
as
to
being
late
that
they
certainly
are
by
a
good
hour
already
and
night
is
falling
and
the
boat
which
should
take
us
back
to
dine
on
board
will
be
gone
probably
we
shall
have
to
sup
japanese
fashion
heaven
only
knows
where
the
people
of
this
country
have
no
sense
of
punctuality
or
of
the
value
of
time
therefore
i
continue
to
inspect
the
minute
and
comical
details
of
my
dwelling
here
instead
of
handles
such
as
we
should
have
put
to
pull
these
movable
partitions
they
have
made
little
oval
holes
just
the
shape
of
a
and
into
which
one
is
evidently
to
put
thumb
these
little
holes
have
a
bronze
ornamentation
and
on
looking
closely
one
sees
that
the
bronze
is
curiously
chased
here
is
a
lady
fanning
herself
there
in
the
next
hole
is
represented
a
branch
of
cherry
in
full
blossom
what
eccentricity
there
is
in
the
taste
of
this
people
to
bestow
assiduous
labor
on
such
miniature
work
and
then
to
hide
it
at
the
bottom
of
a
hole
to
put
one
finger
in
looking
like
a
mere
spot
in
the
middle
of
a
great
white
panel
to
accumulate
so
much
patient
and
delicate
workmanship
on
almost
imperceptible
accessories
and
all
to
produce
an
effect
which
is
absolutely
an
effect
of
the
most
utter
bareness
and
nudity
yves
still
continues
to
gaze
forth
like
sister
anne
from
the
side
on
which
he
leans
my
verandah
overlooks
a
street
or
rather
a
road
bordered
with
houses
which
climbs
higher
and
higher
and
loses
itself
almost
immediately
in
the
verdure
of
the
mountain
in
the
fields
of
tea
the
underwood
and
the
cemeteries
as
for
myself
this
delay
finishes
by
irritating
me
for
good
and
all
and
i
turn
my
glances
to
the
opposite
side
the
other
front
of
my
house
also
a
verandah
opens
first
of
all
upon
a
garden
then
upon
a
marvelous
panorama
of
woods
and
mountains
with
all
the
venerable
japanese
quarters
of
nagasaki
lying
confusedly
like
a
black
six
hundred
feet
below
us
this
evening
in
a
dull
twilight
notwithstanding
that
it
is
a
twilight
of
july
these
things
are
melancholy
there
are
great
clouds
heavy
with
rain
and
showers
ready
to
fall
traveling
across
the
sky
no
i
can
not
feel
at
home
in
this
strange
dwelling
i
have
chosen
i
feel
sensations
of
extreme
solitude
and
strangeness
the
mere
prospect
of
passing
the
night
in
it
gives
me
a
shudder
of
horror
ah
at
last
brother
said
yves
i
believe
yes
i
really
believe
she
is
coming
at
last
i
look
over
his
shoulder
and
i
see
a
back
view
of
a
little
doll
the
finishing
touches
to
whose
toilette
are
being
put
in
the
solitary
street
a
last
maternal
glance
given
to
the
enormous
bows
of
the
sash
the
folds
at
the
waist
her
dress
is
of
silk
her
sash
of
mauve
satin
a
sprig
of
silver
flowers
trembles
in
her
black
hair
a
parting
ray
of
sunlight
touches
the
little
figure
five
or
six
persons
accompany
her
yes
it
is
undoubtedly
mdlle
jasmin
they
are
bringing
me
my
i
rush
to
the
ground
floor
inhabited
by
old
madame
prune
my
landlady
and
her
aged
husband
they
are
absorbed
in
prayer
before
the
altar
of
their
ancestors
here
they
are
madame
prune
i
cry
in
japanese
here
they
are
bring
at
once
the
tea
the
lamp
the
embers
the
little
pipes
for
the
ladies
the
little
bamboo
pots
for
spittoons
bring
us
as
quickly
as
possible
all
the
accessories
for
my
reception
i
hear
the
front
door
open
and
hasten
upstairs
again
wooden
clogs
are
deposited
on
the
floor
the
staircase
creaks
gently
under
the
little
bare
feet
yves
and
i
look
at
each
other
with
a
longing
to
laugh
an
old
lady
enters
two
old
ladies
three
old
ladies
emerging
from
the
doorway
one
after
another
with
jerking
and
mechanical
salutations
which
we
return
as
best
we
can
fully
conscious
of
our
inferiority
in
this
particular
style
then
come
persons
of
intermediate
age
then
quite
young
ones
a
dozen
at
least
friends
neighbors
the
whole
quarter
in
fact
and
the
whole
company
on
arriving
becomes
confusedly
engaged
in
reciprocal
salutations
i
salute
you
you
salute
me
i
salute
you
again
and
you
return
it
and
i
you
again
and
i
express
that
i
shall
never
never
be
able
to
return
it
according
to
your
high
merit
and
i
bang
my
forehead
against
the
ground
and
you
stick
your
nose
between
the
planks
of
the
flooring
and
there
they
are
on
all
fours
one
before
the
other
it
is
a
polite
dispute
all
anxious
to
yield
precedence
as
to
sitting
down
or
passing
first
and
compliments
without
end
are
murmured
in
low
tones
with
faces
against
the
floor
they
seat
themselves
at
last
smiling
in
a
ceremonious
circle
we
two
remaining
standing
our
eyes
fixed
on
the
staircase
and
at
length
emerges
in
due
turn
the
little
aigrette
of
silver
flowers
the
ebony
chignon
the
gray
silk
robe
and
mauve
sash
of
mdlle
jasmin
my
fiancée
heavens
why
i
know
her
already
long
before
setting
foot
in
japan
i
had
met
with
her
on
every
fan
on
every
with
her
silly
air
her
puffy
little
visage
her
tiny
eyes
mere
above
those
expanses
of
impossible
pink
and
white
which
are
her
cheeks
she
is
young
that
is
all
i
can
say
in
her
favor
she
is
even
so
young
that
i
should
almost
scruple
to
accept
her
the
wish
to
laugh
quits
me
suddenly
and
instead
a
profound
chill
fastens
on
my
heart
what
share
even
an
hour
of
my
life
with
that
little
doll
never
the
next
question
is
how
to
get
out
of
it
she
advances
smiling
with
an
air
of
repressed
triumph
and
behind
her
looms
kangourou
in
his
suit
of
gray
tweed
fresh
salutes
and
behold
her
on
all
fours
she
too
before
my
landlady
and
before
my
neighbors
yves
the
big
yves
who
is
not
going
to
be
married
stands
behind
me
with
a
comical
grimace
hardly
repressing
his
laughter
while
to
give
myself
time
to
collect
my
ideas
i
offer
tea
in
little
cups
little
spittoons
and
embers
to
the
company
nevertheless
my
discomfited
air
does
not
escape
my
visitors
kangourou
anxiously
inquires
how
do
i
like
her
and
i
reply
in
a
low
voice
but
with
great
resolution
not
at
all
i
wo
have
that
one
never
i
believe
that
this
remark
was
almost
understood
in
the
circle
around
me
consternation
was
depicted
on
every
face
the
jaws
dropped
the
pipes
went
out
and
now
i
address
my
reproaches
to
kangourou
why
had
he
brought
her
to
me
in
such
pomp
before
friends
and
neighbors
of
both
sexes
instead
of
showing
her
to
me
discreetly
as
if
by
chance
as
i
had
wished
what
an
affront
he
will
compel
me
now
to
put
upon
all
these
polite
persons
the
old
ladies
the
mamma
no
doubt
and
aunts
prick
up
their
ears
and
kangourou
translates
to
them
softening
as
much
as
possible
my
heartrending
decision
i
feel
really
almost
sorry
for
them
the
fact
is
that
for
women
who
not
to
put
too
fine
a
point
upon
it
have
come
to
sell
a
child
they
have
an
air
i
was
not
prepared
for
i
can
hardly
say
an
air
of
a
word
in
use
with
us
which
is
absolutely
without
meaning
in
japan
but
an
air
of
unconscious
and
simplicity
they
are
only
accomplishing
an
act
perfectly
admissible
in
their
world
and
really
it
all
resembles
more
than
i
could
have
thought
possible
a
marriage
but
what
fault
do
i
find
with
the
little
girl
asks
kangourou
in
consternation
i
endeavor
to
present
the
matter
in
the
most
flattering
light
she
is
very
young
i
say
and
then
she
is
too
white
too
much
like
our
own
women
i
wished
for
a
yellow
one
just
as
a
change
but
that
is
only
the
paint
they
have
put
on
her
sir
beneath
it
i
assure
you
she
is
yellow
yves
leans
towards
me
and
whispers
look
over
there
brother
in
that
corner
by
the
last
panel
have
you
noticed
the
one
who
is
sitting
down
not
i
in
my
annoyance
i
had
not
observed
her
she
had
her
back
to
the
light
was
dressed
in
dark
colors
and
sat
in
the
careless
attitude
of
one
who
keeps
in
the
background
the
fact
is
this
one
pleased
me
much
better
eyes
with
long
lashes
rather
narrow
but
which
would
have
been
called
good
in
any
country
in
the
world
almost
an
expression
almost
a
thought
a
coppery
tint
on
her
rounded
cheeks
a
straight
nose
slightly
thick
lips
but
well
modeled
and
with
pretty
corners
less
young
than
mdlle
jasmin
about
eighteen
years
of
age
perhaps
already
more
of
a
woman
she
wore
an
expression
of
ennui
also
of
a
little
contempt
as
if
she
regretted
her
attendance
at
a
spectacle
which
dragged
so
much
and
was
so
little
amusing
kangourou
who
is
that
young
lady
over
there
in
dark
blue
over
there
sir
a
young
lady
called
mdlle
chrysanthème
she
came
with
the
others
you
see
here
she
is
only
here
as
a
spectator
she
pleases
you
said
he
with
eager
suddenness
espying
a
way
out
of
his
difficulty
then
forgetting
all
his
politeness
all
his
ceremoniousness
all
his
japanesery
he
takes
her
by
the
hand
forces
her
to
rise
to
stand
in
the
dying
daylight
to
let
herself
be
seen
and
she
who
has
followed
our
eyes
and
begins
to
guess
what
is
on
foot
lowers
her
head
in
confusion
with
a
more
decided
but
more
charming
pout
and
tries
to
step
back
half
sulky
half
smiling
it
makes
no
difference
continues
kangourou
it
can
be
arranged
just
as
well
with
this
one
she
is
not
married
either
sir
she
is
not
married
then
why
did
the
idiot
propose
her
to
me
at
once
instead
of
the
other
for
whom
i
have
a
feeling
of
the
greatest
pity
poor
little
soul
with
her
pearly
gray
dress
her
sprig
of
flowers
her
expression
which
grows
sadder
and
her
eyes
which
twinkle
like
those
of
a
child
about
to
cry
it
can
be
arranged
sir
repeats
kangourou
again
who
at
this
moment
appears
to
me
a
of
the
lowest
type
a
rascal
of
the
meanest
kind
only
he
adds
we
yves
and
i
are
in
the
way
during
the
negotiations
and
while
mdlle
chrysanthème
remains
with
her
eyelids
lowered
as
befits
the
occasion
while
the
various
families
on
whose
countenances
may
be
read
every
degree
of
astonishment
every
phase
of
expectation
remain
seated
in
a
circle
on
my
white
mats
he
sends
us
two
into
the
verandah
and
we
gaze
down
into
the
depths
below
us
upon
a
misty
and
vague
nagasaki
a
nagasaki
melting
into
a
blue
haze
of
darkness
then
ensue
long
discourses
in
japanese
arguments
without
end
kangourou
who
is
washerman
and
low
scamp
in
french
only
has
returned
for
these
discussions
to
the
long
formulas
of
his
country
from
time
to
time
i
express
impatience
i
ask
this
worthy
creature
whom
i
am
less
and
less
able
to
consider
in
a
serious
light
come
now
tell
us
frankly
kangourou
are
we
any
nearer
coming
to
some
arrangement
is
all
this
ever
going
to
end
in
a
moment
sir
in
a
moment
and
he
resumes
his
air
of
political
economist
seriously
debating
social
problems
well
one
must
submit
to
the
slowness
of
this
people
and
while
the
darkness
falls
like
a
veil
over
the
japanese
town
i
have
leisure
to
reflect
with
as
much
melancholy
as
i
please
upon
the
bargain
that
is
being
concluded
behind
me
night
has
closed
in
deep
night
it
has
been
necessary
to
light
the
lamps
it
is
ten
when
all
is
finally
settled
and
kangourou
comes
to
tell
me
all
is
arranged
sir
her
parents
will
give
her
up
for
twenty
dollars
a
month
the
same
price
as
mdlle
jasmin
on
hearing
this
i
am
possessed
suddenly
with
extreme
vexation
that
i
should
have
made
up
my
mind
so
quickly
to
link
myself
in
ever
so
fleeting
and
transient
a
manner
with
this
little
creature
and
dwell
with
her
in
this
isolated
house
we
come
back
into
the
room
she
is
the
center
of
the
circle
and
seated
and
they
have
placed
the
aigrette
of
flowers
in
her
hair
there
is
actually
some
expression
in
her
glance
and
i
am
almost
persuaded
that
she
this
one
thinks
yves
is
astonished
at
her
modest
attitude
at
her
little
timid
airs
of
a
young
girl
on
the
verge
of
matrimony
he
had
imagined
nothing
like
it
in
such
a
marriage
as
this
nor
i
either
i
must
confess
she
is
really
very
pretty
brother
said
he
very
pretty
take
my
word
for
it
these
good
folks
their
customs
this
scene
strike
him
dumb
with
astonishment
he
can
not
get
over
it
and
remains
in
a
maze
oh
this
is
too
much
and
the
idea
of
writing
a
long
letter
to
his
wife
at
toulven
describing
it
all
diverts
him
greatly
chrysanthème
and
i
join
hands
yves
too
advances
and
touches
the
dainty
little
paw
after
all
if
i
wed
her
it
is
chiefly
his
fault
i
should
never
have
remarked
her
without
his
observation
that
she
was
pretty
who
can
tell
how
this
strange
arrangement
will
turn
out
is
it
a
woman
or
a
doll
well
time
will
show
the
families
having
lighted
their
lanterns
swinging
at
the
ends
of
slight
sticks
prepare
to
beat
a
retreat
with
many
compliments
bows
and
curtsies
when
it
is
a
question
of
descending
the
stairs
no
one
is
willing
to
go
first
and
at
a
given
moment
the
whole
party
are
again
on
all
fours
motionless
and
murmuring
polite
phrases
in
undertones
haul
back
there
said
yves
laughing
and
employing
a
nautical
term
used
when
there
is
a
stoppage
of
any
kind
at
length
they
all
melt
away
descend
the
stairs
with
a
last
buzzing
accompaniment
of
civilities
and
polite
phrases
finished
from
one
step
to
another
in
voices
which
gradually
die
away
he
and
i
remain
alone
in
the
unfriendly
empty
apartment
where
the
mats
are
still
littered
with
the
little
cups
of
tea
the
absurd
little
pipes
and
the
miniature
trays
let
us
watch
them
go
away
said
yves
leaning
out
at
the
door
of
the
garden
is
a
renewal
of
the
same
salutations
and
curtsies
and
then
the
two
groups
of
women
separate
their
bedaubed
paper
lanterns
fade
away
trembling
in
the
distance
balanced
at
the
extremity
of
flexible
canes
which
they
hold
in
their
as
one
would
hold
a
in
the
dark
to
catch
the
procession
of
the
unfortunate
mdlle
jasmin
mounts
upwards
towards
the
mountain
while
that
of
mdlle
chrysanthème
winds
downwards
by
a
narrow
old
street
half
stairway
half
which
leads
to
the
town
then
we
also
depart
the
night
is
fresh
silent
exquisite
the
eternal
song
of
the
cicalas
fills
the
air
we
can
still
see
the
red
lanterns
of
my
new
family
dwindling
away
in
the
distance
as
they
descend
and
gradually
become
lost
in
that
yawning
abyss
at
the
bottom
of
which
lies
nagasaki
our
way
too
lies
downwards
but
on
an
opposite
slope
by
steep
paths
leading
to
the
sea
and
when
i
find
myself
once
more
on
board
when
the
scene
enacted
on
the
hill
up
above
recurs
to
my
mind
it
seems
to
me
that
my
betrothal
is
a
joke
and
my
new
family
a
set
of
puppets
it
is
three
days
now
since
my
marriage
was
an
accomplished
fact
in
the
lower
part
of
the
town
in
the
middle
of
one
of
the
new
cosmopolitan
districts
in
the
ugly
pretentious
building
which
is
a
kind
of
register
office
the
deed
has
been
signed
and
countersigned
with
marvelous
hieroglyphics
in
a
large
book
in
the
presence
of
those
ridiculous
little
creatures
formerly
but
now
called
policemen
and
dressed
up
in
tight
jackets
and
russian
caps
the
ceremony
took
place
in
the
full
heat
of
chrysanthème
and
her
mother
arrived
there
together
and
i
went
alone
we
seemed
to
have
met
for
the
purpose
of
ratifying
some
discreditable
contract
and
the
two
women
trembled
in
the
presence
of
these
ugly
little
individuals
who
in
their
eyes
were
the
personification
of
the
law
in
the
middle
of
their
official
scrawl
they
made
me
write
in
french
my
name
christian
name
and
profession
then
they
gave
me
an
extraordinary
document
on
a
sheet
of
which
set
forth
the
permission
granted
me
by
the
civilian
authorities
of
the
island
of
to
inhabit
a
house
situated
in
the
suburb
of
with
a
person
called
chrysanthème
the
said
permission
being
available
under
protection
of
the
police
during
the
whole
of
my
stay
in
japan
in
the
evening
however
up
there
in
our
own
quarter
our
little
marriage
became
a
very
pretty
affair
a
procession
carrying
lanterns
a
festive
tea
and
some
music
it
was
indeed
high
time
now
we
are
almost
an
old
married
couple
and
we
are
gently
settling
down
into
habits
chrysanthème
tends
the
flowers
in
our
bronze
vases
dresses
herself
with
studied
care
proud
of
her
socks
with
the
divided
big
toe
and
strums
all
day
on
a
kind
of
guitar
producing
therefrom
plaintive
and
sad
sounds
vi
in
our
home
all
has
the
appearance
of
a
japanese
picture
we
have
nothing
but
little
little
curiously
shaped
stools
bearing
vases
full
of
nosegays
and
at
the
further
end
of
the
apartment
in
a
nook
forming
an
altar
a
large
gilded
buddha
sits
enthroned
in
a
lotus
the
house
is
just
as
i
had
fancied
it
should
be
in
the
many
dreams
of
japan
i
had
made
before
my
arrival
during
my
long
night
watches
perched
on
high
in
a
peaceful
suburb
in
the
midst
of
green
gardens
made
up
of
paper
panels
and
taken
to
pieces
according
to
one
fancy
like
a
child
toy
whole
families
of
cicalas
chirp
day
and
night
under
our
old
resounding
roof
from
our
verandah
we
have
a
bewildering
view
of
nagasaki
of
its
streets
its
junks
and
its
great
pagodas
which
at
certain
hours
is
lit
up
at
our
feet
like
some
fairylike
scene
vii
as
a
mere
outline
little
chrysanthème
has
been
seen
everywhere
and
by
everybody
whoever
has
looked
at
one
of
those
paintings
on
china
or
on
silk
that
now
fill
our
bazaars
knows
by
heart
the
pretty
stiff
the
leaning
figure
ever
ready
to
try
some
new
gracious
salutation
the
scarf
fastened
behind
in
an
enormous
bow
the
large
falling
sleeves
the
dress
slightly
clinging
about
the
ankles
with
a
little
crooked
train
like
a
lizard
tail
but
her
face
no
every
one
has
not
seen
it
there
is
something
special
about
it
moreover
the
type
of
women
the
japanese
paint
mostly
on
their
vases
is
an
exceptional
one
in
their
country
it
is
almost
exclusively
among
the
nobility
that
these
personages
are
found
with
their
long
pale
faces
painted
in
tender
and
silly
long
necks
which
give
them
the
appearance
of
storks
this
distinguished
type
which
i
am
obliged
to
admit
was
also
mdlle
jasmin
is
rare
particularly
at
nagasaki
in
the
middle
class
and
the
people
the
ugliness
is
more
pleasant
and
sometimes
becomes
a
kind
of
prettiness
the
eyes
are
still
too
small
and
hardly
able
to
open
but
the
faces
are
rounder
browner
more
vivacious
and
in
the
women
there
remains
a
certain
vagueness
in
the
features
something
childlike
which
prevails
to
the
very
end
of
their
lives
they
are
so
laughing
so
merry
all
these
little
niponese
dolls
rather
a
forced
mirth
it
is
true
studied
and
at
times
with
a
false
ring
in
it
nevertheless
one
is
attracted
by
it
chrysanthème
is
an
exception
for
she
is
melancholy
what
thoughts
can
be
running
through
that
little
brain
my
knowledge
of
her
language
is
still
too
restricted
to
enable
me
to
find
out
moreover
it
is
a
hundred
to
one
that
she
has
no
thoughts
whatever
and
even
if
she
had
what
do
i
care
i
have
chosen
her
to
amuse
me
and
i
would
really
rather
she
should
have
one
of
those
insignificant
little
thoughtless
faces
like
all
the
others
viii
when
night
closes
in
we
light
two
hanging
lamps
of
a
religious
character
which
burn
till
morn
before
our
gilded
idol
we
sleep
on
the
floor
on
a
thin
cotton
mattress
which
is
unfolded
and
laid
out
over
our
white
mats
chrysanthème
pillow
is
a
little
wooden
block
scooped
out
to
fit
exactly
the
nape
of
the
neck
without
disturbing
the
elaborate
which
must
never
be
taken
down
the
pretty
black
hair
i
shall
probably
never
see
undone
my
pillow
a
chinese
model
is
a
kind
of
little
square
drum
covered
over
with
serpent
skin
we
sleep
under
a
gauze
mosquito
net
of
somber
greenish
blue
dark
as
the
shades
of
night
stretched
out
on
an
ribbon
these
are
the
traditional
colors
and
all
the
respectable
families
of
nagaski
possess
a
similar
gauze
it
envelops
us
like
a
tent
the
mosquitoes
and
the
dance
around
it
this
sounds
very
pretty
and
written
down
looks
very
well
in
reality
however
it
is
not
so
something
i
know
not
what
is
wanting
and
it
is
all
very
paltry
in
other
lands
in
the
delightful
isles
of
oceania
in
the
old
lifeless
quarters
of
stamboul
it
seemed
as
if
mere
words
could
never
express
all
i
felt
and
i
vainly
struggled
against
my
own
incompetence
to
render
in
human
language
the
penetrating
charm
surrounding
me
here
on
the
contrary
words
exact
and
truthful
in
themselves
seem
always
too
thrilling
too
great
for
the
subject
seem
to
embellish
it
unduly
i
feel
as
if
i
were
acting
for
my
own
benefit
some
wretchedly
trivial
and
comedy
and
whenever
i
try
to
consider
my
home
in
a
serious
spirit
the
scoffing
figure
of
kangourou
rises
up
before
me
the
matrimonial
agent
to
whom
i
am
indebted
for
my
happiness
ix
yves
comes
up
to
us
whenever
he
is
free
in
the
evening
at
five
after
his
work
on
board
he
is
our
only
european
visitor
and
with
the
exception
of
a
few
civilities
and
cups
of
tea
exchanged
with
our
neighbors
we
lead
a
very
retired
life
only
in
the
evenings
winding
our
way
through
the
precipitous
little
streets
and
carrying
our
lanterns
at
the
end
of
short
sticks
we
go
down
to
nagasaki
in
search
of
amusement
at
the
theaters
at
the
or
in
the
bazaars
yves
treats
this
wife
of
mine
as
if
she
were
a
plaything
and
continually
assures
me
that
she
is
charming
myself
i
find
her
as
exasperating
as
the
cicalas
on
my
roof
and
when
i
am
alone
at
home
side
by
side
with
this
little
creature
twanging
the
strings
of
her
guitar
in
front
of
this
marvelous
panorama
of
pagodas
and
mountains
i
am
overcome
by
a
sadness
full
of
tears
x
last
night
as
we
lay
under
the
japanese
roof
of
under
the
thin
and
ancient
wooden
roof
scorched
by
a
hundred
years
of
sunshine
vibrating
at
the
least
sound
like
the
parchment
of
a
tamtam
in
the
silence
which
prevails
at
two
in
the
morning
we
heard
overhead
a
regular
wild
huntsman
chase
passing
at
full
gallop
nidzoumi
the
mice
said
chrysanthème
suddenly
the
word
brings
back
to
my
mind
yet
another
spoken
in
a
very
different
language
in
a
country
far
away
from
here
setchan
a
word
heard
elsewhere
a
word
that
has
likewise
been
whispered
in
my
ear
by
a
woman
voice
under
similar
circumstances
in
a
moment
of
nocturnal
terror
setchan
it
was
during
one
of
our
first
nights
at
stamboul
spent
under
the
mysterious
roof
of
eyoub
when
danger
surrounded
us
on
all
sides
a
noise
on
the
steps
of
the
black
staircase
had
made
us
tremble
and
she
also
my
dear
little
turkish
companion
had
said
to
me
in
her
beloved
language
setchan
the
mice
at
that
fond
recollection
a
thrill
of
sweet
memories
coursed
through
my
veins
it
was
as
though
i
had
been
startled
out
of
a
long
ten
years
sleep
i
looked
down
upon
the
doll
beside
me
with
a
sort
of
hatred
wondering
why
i
was
there
and
i
arose
with
almost
a
feeling
of
remorse
to
escape
from
that
blue
gauze
net
i
stepped
out
upon
the
verandah
and
there
i
paused
gazing
into
the
depths
of
the
starlit
night
beneath
me
nagasaki
lay
asleep
wrapt
in
a
soft
light
slumber
hushed
by
the
murmuring
sound
of
a
thousand
insects
in
the
moonlight
and
fairylike
with
its
roseate
hues
then
turning
my
head
i
saw
behind
me
the
gilded
idol
with
our
lamps
burning
in
front
of
it
the
idol
smiling
its
impassive
buddha
smile
and
its
presence
seemed
to
cast
around
it
something
i
know
not
what
strange
and
incomprehensible
never
until
now
had
i
slept
under
the
eye
of
such
a
god
in
the
midst
of
the
calm
and
silence
of
the
night
i
strove
to
recall
my
poignant
impressions
of
stamboul
but
alas
i
strove
in
vain
they
would
not
return
to
me
in
this
strange
world
through
the
transparent
blue
gauze
appeared
my
little
japanese
as
she
lay
in
her
somber
with
all
the
fantastic
grace
of
her
country
the
nape
of
her
neck
resting
on
its
wooden
block
and
her
hair
arranged
in
large
shiny
bows
her
arms
pretty
and
delicate
emerged
bare
up
to
the
shoulders
from
her
wide
sleeves
what
can
those
mice
on
the
roof
have
done
to
him
thought
chrysanthème
of
course
she
could
not
understand
in
a
coaxing
manner
like
a
playful
kitten
she
glanced
at
me
with
her
eyes
inquiring
why
i
did
not
come
back
to
sleep
and
i
returned
to
my
place
by
her
side
xi
it
is
the
national
fête
day
of
france
in
nagasaki
roadstead
all
the
ships
are
dressed
out
with
flags
and
salutes
are
firing
in
our
honor
alas
all
day
long
i
can
not
help
thinking
of
that
last
fourteenth
of
july
spent
in
the
deep
calm
and
stillness
of
my
old
home
the
door
closed
to
all
intruders
while
the
gay
crowd
roared
outside
there
i
had
remained
till
evening
seated
on
a
bench
shaded
by
a
trellis
covered
with
honeysuckle
where
in
the
days
of
my
summers
i
used
to
settle
myself
with
my
copybooks
and
pretend
to
learn
my
lessons
oh
those
days
when
i
was
supposed
to
learn
my
lessons
how
my
thoughts
used
to
rove
what
voyages
what
distant
lands
what
tropical
forests
did
i
not
behold
in
my
dreams
at
that
time
near
the
garden
bench
in
some
of
the
crevices
in
the
stone
wall
there
dwelt
many
a
big
ugly
black
spider
ever
on
the
watch
peeping
out
of
his
nook
ready
to
pounce
upon
any
giddy
fly
or
wandering
centipede
one
of
my
amusements
consisted
in
tickling
the
spiders
gently
very
gently
with
a
blade
of
grass
or
a
cherry
stalk
in
their
holes
mystified
they
would
rush
out
fancying
they
had
to
deal
with
some
sort
of
prey
whilst
i
would
rapidly
draw
back
my
hand
in
disgust
well
last
year
on
that
fourteenth
of
july
as
i
recalled
my
days
of
latin
themes
and
translations
now
forever
flown
and
this
game
of
boyish
days
i
actually
recognized
the
very
same
spiders
or
at
least
their
daughters
lying
in
wait
in
the
very
same
holes
gazing
at
them
and
at
the
tufts
of
grass
and
moss
around
me
a
thousand
memories
of
those
summers
of
my
early
life
welled
up
within
me
memories
which
for
years
past
had
lain
slumbering
under
this
old
wall
sheltered
by
the
ivy
boughs
while
all
that
is
ourselves
perpetually
changes
and
passes
away
the
constancy
with
which
nature
repeats
always
in
the
same
manner
her
most
infinitesimal
details
seems
a
wonderful
mystery
the
same
peculiar
species
of
moss
grow
afresh
for
centuries
on
precisely
the
same
spot
and
the
same
little
insects
each
summer
do
the
same
thing
in
the
same
place
i
must
admit
that
this
episode
of
my
childhood
and
the
spiders
have
little
to
do
with
the
story
of
chrysanthème
but
an
incongruous
interruption
is
quite
in
keeping
with
the
taste
of
this
country
everywhere
it
is
practiced
in
conversation
in
music
even
in
painting
a
landscape
painter
for
instance
when
he
has
finished
a
picture
of
mountains
and
crags
will
not
hesitate
to
draw
in
the
very
middle
of
the
sky
a
circle
or
a
lozenge
or
some
kind
of
framework
within
which
he
will
represent
anything
incoherent
and
inappropriate
a
bonze
fanning
himself
or
a
lady
taking
a
cup
of
tea
nothing
is
more
thoroughly
japanese
than
such
digressions
made
without
the
slightest
àpropos
moreover
if
i
roused
my
past
memories
it
was
the
better
to
force
myself
to
notice
the
difference
between
that
of
july
last
year
so
peacefully
spent
amidst
surroundings
familiar
to
me
from
my
earliest
infancy
and
the
present
animated
one
passed
in
the
midst
of
such
a
novel
world
therefore
under
the
scorching
sun
at
two
three
djins
dragged
us
at
full
speed
yves
chrysanthème
and
myself
in
indian
file
each
in
a
little
jolting
cart
to
the
further
end
of
nagasaki
and
there
deposited
us
at
the
foot
of
some
gigantic
steps
that
run
straight
up
into
the
mountain
these
are
the
granite
steps
leading
to
the
great
temple
of
osueva
wide
enough
to
give
access
to
a
whole
regiment
they
are
as
grand
and
imposing
as
any
work
of
babylon
or
nineveh
and
in
complete
contrast
with
all
the
finical
surroundings
we
climb
up
and
up
chrysanthème
listlessly
affecting
fatigue
under
her
paper
parasol
painted
with
pink
butterflies
on
a
black
ground
as
we
ascended
we
passed
under
enormous
monastic
porticos
also
in
granite
of
rude
and
primitive
style
in
truth
these
steps
and
these
temple
porticos
are
the
only
imposing
works
that
this
people
has
created
and
they
astonish
for
they
scarcely
seem
japanese
we
climb
up
still
higher
at
this
sultry
hour
of
the
day
from
top
to
bottom
of
the
immense
gray
steps
only
we
three
are
to
be
seen
on
all
that
granite
there
are
but
the
pink
butterflies
on
parasol
to
throw
a
cheerful
and
brilliant
note
we
passed
through
the
first
temple
yard
in
which
are
a
couple
of
white
china
turrets
bronze
lanterns
and
the
statue
of
a
large
horse
in
jade
then
without
pausing
at
the
sanctuary
we
turned
to
the
left
and
entered
a
shady
garden
which
formed
a
terrace
halfway
up
the
hill
and
at
the
extremity
of
which
was
situated
the
in
english
of
the
it
was
here
that
chrysanthème
was
taking
us
we
sat
down
at
a
table
under
a
black
linen
tent
decorated
with
large
white
letters
of
funereal
aspect
and
two
laughing
hurried
up
to
wait
upon
us
the
word
means
a
young
girl
or
very
young
woman
it
is
one
of
the
prettiest
words
in
the
niponese
language
it
seems
almost
as
if
there
were
a
little
c
in
the
very
sound
and
as
if
a
pretty
taking
little
pout
such
as
they
put
on
and
also
a
little
pert
physiognomy
were
described
by
it
i
shall
often
make
use
of
it
knowing
none
other
in
our
own
language
that
conveys
the
same
meaning
footnote
c
means
pout
in
french
some
japanese
watteau
must
have
mapped
out
this
for
it
has
rather
an
affected
air
of
rurality
though
very
pretty
well
shaded
under
a
thick
vault
of
large
trees
densely
foliaged
a
miniature
lake
hard
by
the
chosen
residence
of
a
few
toads
has
given
it
its
attractive
denomination
lucky
toads
who
crawl
and
croak
on
the
finest
of
moss
in
the
midst
of
tiny
artificial
islets
decked
with
gardenias
in
full
bloom
from
time
to
time
one
of
them
informs
us
of
his
thoughts
by
a
couac
uttered
in
a
deep
bass
croak
infinitely
more
hollow
than
that
of
our
own
toads
under
the
tent
of
this
we
are
as
it
were
on
a
balcony
jutting
out
from
the
mountain
side
overhanging
from
on
high
the
grayish
town
and
its
suburbs
buried
in
greenery
around
above
and
beneath
us
cling
and
hang
on
every
possible
point
clumps
of
trees
and
fresh
green
woods
with
the
delicate
and
varying
foliage
of
the
temperate
zone
then
we
can
see
at
our
feet
the
deep
roadstead
and
slanting
diminished
in
appearance
till
it
looks
like
a
terrible
somber
tear
in
the
mass
of
large
green
mountains
and
further
still
quite
low
down
on
the
waters
which
seem
black
and
stagnant
are
to
be
seen
very
tiny
and
overwhelmed
the
the
steamboats
and
the
junks
flags
flying
from
every
mast
on
the
dark
green
which
is
the
dominant
shade
around
stand
out
these
thousand
scraps
of
bunting
emblems
of
the
different
nationalities
all
displayed
all
flying
in
honor
of
france
the
colors
most
prevailing
in
this
motley
assemblage
are
the
white
flag
with
a
red
ball
emblem
of
the
of
the
rising
where
we
now
are
with
the
exception
of
three
or
four
mousmés
at
the
further
end
who
are
practicing
with
bows
and
arrows
we
are
the
only
people
in
the
garden
and
the
mountain
round
about
is
silent
having
finished
her
cigarette
and
her
cup
of
tea
chrysanthème
also
wishes
to
exert
her
skill
for
archery
is
still
held
in
honor
among
the
young
women
the
old
man
who
keeps
the
range
picks
out
for
her
his
best
arrows
tipped
with
white
and
red
feathers
and
she
takes
aim
with
a
serious
air
the
mark
is
a
circle
traced
in
the
middle
of
a
picture
on
which
is
painted
in
flat
gray
tones
terrifying
chimera
flying
through
the
clouds
chrysanthème
is
certainly
an
adroit
markswoman
and
we
admire
her
as
much
as
she
expected
then
yves
who
is
usually
clever
at
all
games
of
skill
wishes
to
try
his
luck
and
fails
it
is
amusing
to
see
her
with
her
mincing
ways
and
smiles
arrange
with
the
tips
of
her
little
fingers
the
broad
hands
placing
them
on
the
bow
and
the
string
in
order
to
teach
him
the
proper
manner
never
have
they
seemed
to
get
on
so
well
together
yves
and
my
dolly
and
i
might
even
feel
anxious
were
i
less
sure
of
my
good
brother
and
if
moreover
it
were
not
a
matter
of
perfect
indifference
to
me
in
the
stillness
of
the
garden
mid
the
balmy
peacefulness
of
these
mountains
a
loud
noise
suddenly
startles
us
a
unique
powerful
terrible
sound
which
is
prolonged
in
infinite
metallic
vibrations
it
begins
again
sounding
more
appalling
borne
to
us
by
the
rising
wind
kané
explains
chrysanthème
and
she
again
takes
up
her
arrows
the
japanese
brass
it
is
the
japanese
brass
that
is
sounding
it
is
the
monstrous
gong
of
a
monastery
situated
in
a
suburb
beneath
us
well
it
is
powerful
indeed
the
japanese
brass
when
the
strokes
are
ended
when
it
is
no
longer
heard
a
vibration
seems
to
linger
among
the
suspended
foliage
and
an
endless
quiver
runs
through
the
air
i
am
obliged
to
admit
that
chrysanthème
looks
very
charming
shooting
her
arrows
her
figure
well
bent
back
the
better
to
bend
her
bow
her
sleeves
caught
up
to
her
shoulders
showing
the
graceful
bare
arms
polished
like
amber
and
very
much
of
the
same
color
each
arrow
whistles
by
with
the
rustle
of
a
bird
wing
then
a
short
sharp
little
blow
is
heard
the
target
is
hit
always
at
nightfall
when
chrysanthème
has
gone
up
to
we
cross
yves
and
myself
the
european
concession
on
our
way
to
the
ship
to
take
up
our
watch
till
the
following
day
the
cosmopolitan
quarter
exhaling
an
odor
of
absinthe
is
dressed
up
with
flags
and
squibs
are
being
fired
off
in
honor
of
france
long
lines
of
djins
pass
by
dragging
as
fast
as
their
naked
legs
can
carry
them
the
crew
of
the
who
are
shouting
and
fanning
themselves
the
marseillaise
is
heard
everywhere
english
sailors
are
singing
it
gutturally
with
a
dull
and
slow
cadence
like
their
own
god
save
in
all
the
american
bars
grinding
organs
are
hammering
it
with
many
an
odious
variation
and
flourish
in
order
to
attract
our
men
just
one
funny
recollection
comes
back
to
me
of
that
evening
on
our
return
we
had
by
mistake
got
into
a
street
inhabited
by
a
multitude
of
ladies
of
doubtful
reputation
i
can
still
see
that
big
fellow
yves
struggling
with
a
whole
band
of
tiny
little
mousmés
of
some
twelve
or
fifteen
years
of
age
who
barely
reached
up
to
his
waist
and
were
pulling
him
by
the
sleeves
anxious
to
lead
him
astray
astonished
and
indignant
he
repeated
as
he
extricated
himself
from
their
clutches
oh
this
is
too
much
so
shocked
was
he
at
seeing
such
mere
babies
so
young
so
tiny
already
so
brazen
and
shameless
xii
there
are
now
four
of
us
four
officers
of
my
ship
married
like
myself
and
inhabiting
the
slopes
of
the
same
suburb
it
is
quite
an
ordinary
occurrence
and
is
arranged
without
difficulties
mystery
or
danger
through
the
negotiations
of
the
same
kangourou
as
a
matter
of
course
we
are
on
visiting
terms
with
all
these
ladies
first
there
is
our
very
merry
neighbor
madame
campanule
who
is
little
charles
n
wife
then
madame
jonquille
who
is
even
merrier
than
campanule
like
a
young
bird
and
the
daintiest
fairy
of
the
whole
lot
she
has
married
x
a
fair
northerner
who
adores
her
they
are
a
loverlike
and
inseparable
pair
the
only
one
that
will
probably
weep
when
the
hour
of
parting
comes
then
with
doctor
y
and
lastly
the
midshipman
z
with
the
tiny
madame
no
taller
than
a
boot
thirteen
years
old
at
the
outside
and
already
a
regular
woman
full
of
her
own
importance
a
petulant
little
gossip
in
my
childhood
i
was
sometimes
taken
to
the
theater
and
i
remember
a
certain
madame
de
pompadour
a
principal
rôle
filled
by
a
gayly
old
monkey
reminds
me
of
her
in
the
evening
all
these
folk
generally
come
and
fetch
us
for
a
long
processional
walk
with
lighted
lanterns
my
wife
more
serious
more
melancholy
perhaps
even
more
refined
and
belonging
i
fancy
to
a
higher
class
tries
when
these
friends
come
to
us
to
play
the
part
of
the
lady
of
the
house
it
is
comical
to
see
the
entry
of
these
couples
partners
for
a
day
the
ladies
with
their
disjointed
bows
falling
on
all
fours
before
chrysanthème
the
queen
of
the
establishment
when
we
are
all
assembled
we
start
off
arm
in
arm
one
behind
the
other
and
always
carrying
at
the
end
of
our
short
sticks
little
white
or
red
paper
lanterns
it
seems
it
is
pretty
we
are
obliged
to
scramble
down
the
kind
of
street
or
rather
which
leads
to
the
japanese
nagasaki
with
the
prospect
alas
of
having
to
climb
up
again
at
night
clamber
up
all
the
steps
all
the
slippery
slopes
stumble
over
all
the
stones
before
we
shall
be
able
to
get
home
go
to
bed
and
sleep
we
make
our
descent
in
the
darkness
under
the
branches
under
the
foliage
betwixt
dark
gardens
and
venerable
little
houses
that
throw
but
a
faint
glimmer
on
the
road
and
when
the
moon
is
absent
or
clouded
over
our
lanterns
are
by
no
means
unnecessary
when
at
last
we
reach
the
bottom
suddenly
without
transition
we
find
ourselves
in
the
very
heart
of
nagasaki
and
its
busy
throng
in
a
long
illuminated
street
where
vociferating
djins
hurry
along
and
thousands
of
paper
lanterns
swing
and
gleam
in
the
wind
it
is
life
and
animation
after
the
peace
of
our
silent
suburb
here
decorum
requires
we
should
separate
from
our
wives
all
five
take
hold
of
each
others
hands
like
a
batch
of
little
girls
out
walking
we
follow
them
with
an
air
of
indifference
seen
from
behind
our
dolls
are
really
very
dainty
with
their
back
hair
so
tidily
done
up
their
tortoiseshell
pins
so
coquettishly
arranged
they
shuffle
along
their
high
wooden
clogs
making
an
ugly
sound
striving
to
walk
with
their
toes
turned
in
according
to
the
height
of
fashion
and
elegance
at
every
minute
they
burst
out
laughing
yes
seen
from
behind
they
are
very
pretty
they
have
like
all
japanese
women
the
most
lovely
turn
of
the
head
moreover
they
are
very
funny
thus
drawn
up
in
line
in
speaking
of
them
we
say
our
little
dancing
dogs
and
in
truth
they
are
singularly
like
them
this
great
nagasaki
is
the
same
from
one
end
to
another
with
its
numberless
petroleum
lamps
burning
its
lanterns
flickering
and
innumerable
panting
djins
always
the
same
narrow
streets
lined
on
each
side
with
the
same
low
houses
built
in
paper
and
wood
always
the
same
shops
without
glass
windows
open
to
all
the
winds
equally
rudimentary
whatever
may
be
sold
or
made
in
them
whether
they
display
the
finest
gold
lacquer
ware
the
most
marvelous
china
jars
or
old
pots
and
pans
dried
fish
and
ragged
frippery
all
the
salesmen
are
seated
on
the
ground
in
the
midst
of
their
valuable
or
trumpery
merchandise
their
legs
bared
nearly
to
the
waist
and
all
kinds
of
queer
little
trades
are
carried
on
under
the
public
gaze
by
strangely
primitive
means
by
workmen
of
the
most
ingenuous
type
oh
what
wonderful
goods
are
exposed
for
sale
in
those
streets
what
whimsical
extravagances
in
those
bazaars
no
horses
no
carriages
are
ever
seen
in
the
town
nothing
but
people
on
foot
or
the
comical
little
carts
dragged
along
by
the
runners
some
few
europeans
straggling
hither
and
thither
wanderers
from
the
ships
in
harbor
some
japanese
fortunately
as
yet
but
few
in
number
dressed
up
in
coats
other
natives
who
content
themselves
with
adding
to
their
national
costume
the
pot
hat
from
which
their
long
sleek
locks
hang
down
and
all
around
eager
haggling
bargaining
and
laughter
in
the
bazaars
every
evening
our
mousmés
make
endless
purchases
like
spoilt
children
they
buy
everything
they
fancy
toys
pins
ribbons
flowers
and
then
they
prettily
offer
each
other
presents
with
childish
little
smiles
for
instance
campanule
buys
for
chrysanthème
an
ingeniously
contrived
lantern
on
which
set
in
motion
by
some
invisible
machinery
chinese
shadows
dance
in
a
ring
round
the
flame
in
return
chrysanthème
gives
campanule
a
magic
fan
with
paintings
that
change
at
will
from
butterflies
fluttering
round
to
outlandish
monsters
pursuing
each
other
across
black
clouds
touki
offers
sikou
a
cardboard
mask
representing
the
bloated
countenance
of
god
of
wealth
and
sikou
replies
by
a
long
crystal
trumpet
by
means
of
which
are
produced
the
most
extraordinary
sounds
like
a
turkey
gobbling
everything
is
uncouth
fantastical
to
excess
grotesquely
lugubrious
everywhere
we
are
surprised
by
incomprehensible
conceptions
which
seem
the
work
of
distorted
imaginations
in
the
fashionable
where
we
finish
up
our
evenings
the
little
now
bow
to
us
on
our
arrival
with
an
air
of
respectful
recognition
as
belonging
to
the
fast
set
of
nagasaki
there
we
carry
on
desultory
conversations
full
of
misunderstandings
and
endless
pro
of
uncouth
words
in
little
gardens
lighted
up
with
lanterns
near
ponds
full
of
gold
fish
with
little
bridges
little
islets
and
little
ruined
towers
they
hand
us
tea
and
white
and
sweetmeats
flavored
with
pepper
that
taste
strange
and
unfamiliar
and
beverages
mixed
with
snow
tasting
of
flowers
or
perfumes
to
give
a
faithful
account
of
those
evenings
would
require
a
more
affected
style
than
our
own
and
some
kind
of
graphic
sign
would
have
also
to
be
expressly
invented
and
scattered
at
haphazard
amongst
the
words
indicating
the
moment
at
which
the
reader
should
laugh
rather
a
forced
laugh
perhaps
but
amiable
and
gracious
the
evening
at
an
end
it
is
time
to
return
up
there
oh
that
street
that
road
that
we
must
clamber
up
every
evening
under
the
starlit
sky
or
the
heavy
dragging
by
the
hand
our
drowsy
mousmé
in
order
to
regain
our
home
perched
on
high
up
the
hill
where
our
bed
of
matting
awaits
us

some

itself
without
invitation

scampering
over

see
the
manner
in

indicates
it

my
righteous
vengeance

pointing
her
finger
at
it

here
i
must
own

to
the
reader
of
my
story
it
must
appear
to
drag
a
little
in
default
of
exciting
intrigues
and
tragic
adventures
i
would
fain
have
known
how
to
infuse
into
it
a
little
of
the
sweet
perfumes
of
the
gardens
which
surround
me
something
of
the
gentle
warmth
of
the
sunshine
of
the
shade
of
these
graceful
trees
love
being
wanting
i
should
like
it
to
breathe
of
the
restful
tranquillity
of
this
suburb
then
too
i
should
like
it
to
reëcho
the
sound
of
chrysanthème
guitar
in
which
i
begin
to
find
a
certain
charm
for
want
of
something
better
in
the
silence
of
the
lovely
summer
evenings
all
through
these
moonlit
nights
of
july
the
weather
has
been
calm
luminous
and
magnificent
ah
what
glorious
clear
nights
what
exquisite
roseate
tints
beneath
that
wonderful
moon
what
mystery
of
blue
shadows
in
the
thick
tangle
of
trees
and
from
the
heights
where
stood
our
verandah
how
prettily
the
town
lay
sleeping
at
our
feet
after
all
i
do
not
positively
detest
this
little
chrysanthème

when
there
is
no
repugnance
on
either
side
habit
turns
into
a
of
attachment

always
over
in
and
through
everything
rises
day
and
night
from
this
japanese
landscape
the
song
of
the
cicalas
ceaseless
strident
and
prodigious
it
is
everywhere
and
at
no
matter
what
hour
of
the
burning
day
what
hour
of
the
cool
and
refreshing
night
in
the
midst
of
the
roads
as
we
approached
our
anchorage
we
had
heard
it
at
the
same
time
from
the
two
shores
from
both
walls
of
green
mountains
it
is
wearisome
and
haunting
it
seems
to
be
the
manifestation
the
noise
expressive
of
the
special
kind
of
life
peculiar
to
this
region
of
the
world
it
is
the
voice
of
summer
in
these
islands
it
is
the
song
of
unconscious
rejoicing
always
content
with
itself
and
always
appearing
to
inflate
to
rise
upwards
in
a
greater
and
greater
exultation
at
the
sheer
happiness
of
living
it
is
to
me
the
noise
characteristic
of
this
country
this
and
the
cry
of
the
falcon
which
had
in
like
manner
greeted
our
entry
into
japan
over
the
valleys
and
the
deep
bay
sail
these
birds
uttering
from
time
to
time
their
three
cries
han
han
han
in
a
key
of
sadness
which
seems
the
extreme
of
painful
astonishment

yves
chrysanthème
and
little
oyouki
have
struck
up
a
friendship
so
great
that
it
amuses
me
i
even
think
that
in
my
home
life
this
intimacy
is
what
affords
me
the
greatest
entertainment
they
form
a
contrast
which
gives
rise
to
the
most
absurd
jokes
and
most
unforeseen
situations
he
brings
into
this
fragile
little
paper
house
his
sailor
freedom
and
ease
of
manner
and
his
breton
accent
side
by
side
with
these
tiny
mousmés
of
affected
manners
and
voices
who
small
as
they
are
rule
the
big
fellow
as
they
please
make
him
eat
with
chopsticks
teach
him
japanese
and
cheat
him
and
quarrel
and
almost
die
of
laughter
over
it
all
certainly
he
and
chrysanthème
take
a
pleasure
in
each
other
company
but
i
remain
serenely
undisturbed
and
can
not
imagine
that
this
little
chance
doll
with
whom
i
play
at
married
life
could
possibly
bring
a
serious
trouble
between
this
brother
and
myself
xix
my
family
of
japanese
relations
very
numerous
and
very
conspicuous
is
a
great
source
of
diversion
to
those
of
my
brother
officers
who
visit
me
in
my
villa
on
the
hill
most
especially
to
taksan
takaï
the
immensely
tall
friend
i
have
a
charming
quite
a
woman
of
the
world
little
little
cousins
and
aunts
who
are
still
quite
young
i
have
even
a
poor
cousin
twice
removed
who
is
a
djin
there
was
some
hesitation
in
owning
this
latter
to
me
but
behold
during
the
ceremony
of
introduction
we
exchanged
a
smile
of
recognition
it
was
number
over
this
poor
my
friends
on
board
crack
no
end
of
jokes
one
in
particular
who
less
than
any
one
has
the
right
to
make
them
little
charles

for
his
was
once
a
porter
or
something
of
the
kind
at
the
gateway
of
a
pagoda
i
however
who
have
a
great
respect
for
strength
and
agility
much
appreciate
this
new
relative
of
mine
his
legs
are
undoubtedly
the
best
in
all
nagasaki
and
whenever
i
am
in
a
hurry
i
always
beg
madame

to
send
down
to
the
djin
stand

engage
my

i
arrived
unexpectedly
at
in
the
midst
of
a
burning
noonday
heat

the

wooden

her

open

through

came

chrysanthème
had
placed
in
our

were

and
my
eyes
fell
as
i
entered
upon
their
great
rosy
cups
according
to
her
usual
custom
she
was
lying
flat
on
the
floor
enjoying
her
daily
siesta
what
a
singular
originality
these
bouquets
of
chrysanthème
always
have
a
something
difficult
to
define
a
japanese
slimness
a
mannered
grace
which
we
should
never
succeed
in
imparting
to
them
she
was
sleeping
flat
on
her
face
upon
the
mats
her
high
headdress
and
tortoiseshell
pins
standing
out
boldly
from
the
rest
of
the
horizontal
figure
the
train
of
her
tunic
prolonged
her
delicate
little
body
like
the
tail
of
a
bird
her
arms
were
stretched
crosswise
the
sleeves
spread
out
like
wings
and
her
long
guitar
lay
beside
her
she
looked
like
a
dead
fairy
or
still
more
did
she
resemble
some
great
blue
which
having
alighted
on
that
spot
some
unkind
hand
had
pinned
to
the
floor
madame
prune
who
had
come
upstairs
after
me
always
officious
and
eager
manifested
by
her
gestures
her
sentiments
of
indignation
on
beholding
the
careless
reception
accorded
by
chrysanthème
to
her
lord
and
master
and
advanced
to
wake
her
pray
do
nothing
of
the
kind
my
good
madame
prune
you
do
know
how
much
i
prefer
her
like
that
i
had
left
my
shoes
below
according
to
custom
by
the
side
of
the
little
clogs
and
sandals
and
i
entered
on
the
tips
of
my
toes
very
very
softly
to
go
and
sit
awhile
under
the
verandah
what
a
pity
this
little
chrysanthème
can
not
always
be
asleep
she
is
really
extremely
decorative
seen
in
this
manner
and
like
this
at
least
she
does
not
bore
me
who
knows
what
may
perchance
be
going
on
in
that
little
head
and
heart
if
i
only
had
the
means
of
finding
out
but
strange
to
say
since
we
have
kept
house
together
instead
of
pushing
my
studies
in
the
japanese
language
further
i
have
neglected
them
so
much
have
i
felt
the
utter
impossibility
of
ever
interesting
myself
in
the
subject
seated
under
my
verandah
my
eyes
wandered
over
the
temples
and
cemeteries
spread
at
my
feet
over
the
woods
and
green
mountains
over
nagasaki
lying
bathed
in
the
sunlight
the
cicalas
were
chirping
their
loudest
the
strident
noise
trembling
feverishly
in
the
hot
air
all
was
calm
full
of
light
and
full
of
heat
nevertheless
to
my
taste
it
is
not
yet
enough
so
what
then
can
have
changed
upon
the
earth
the
burning
of
summer
such
as
i
can
recall
in
days
gone
by
were
more
brilliant
more
full
of
sunshine
nature
seemed
to
me
in
those
days
more
powerful
more
terrible
one
would
say
this
was
only
a
pale
copy
of
all
that
i
knew
in
early
years
a
copy
in
which
something
is
wanting
sadly
do
i
ask
myself
is
the
splendor
of
the
summer
only
this
only
this
or
is
it
the
fault
of
my
eyes
and
as
time
goes
on
shall
i
behold
everything
around
me
paling
still
more
behind
me
a
faint
and
melancholy
strain
of
music
melancholy
enough
to
make
one
shiver
and
shrill
shrill
as
the
song
of
the
grasshoppers
began
to
make
itself
heard
very
softly
at
first
then
growing
louder
and
rising
in
the
silence
of
the
noonday
like
the
diminutive
wail
of
some
poor
japanese
soul
in
pain
and
anguish
it
was
chrysanthème
and
her
guitar
awaking
together
it
pleased
me
that
the
idea
should
have
occurred
to
her
to
greet
me
with
music
instead
of
eagerly
hastening
to
wish
me
good
morning
at
no
time
have
i
ever
given
myself
the
trouble
to
pretend
the
slightest
affection
for
her
and
a
certain
coldness
even
has
grown
up
between
us
especially
when
we
are
alone
but
i
turn
to
her
with
a
smile
and
wave
my
hand
for
her
to
continue
go
on
it
amuses
me
to
listen
to
your
quaint
little
impromptu
it
is
singular
that
the
music
of
this
essentially
merry
people
should
be
so
plaintive
but
undoubtedly
that
which
chrysanthème
is
playing
at
this
moment
is
worth
listening
to
whence
can
it
have
come
to
her
what
unutterable
dreams
forever
hidden
from
me
fly
through
her
yellow
head
when
she
plays
or
sings
in
this
manner
suddenly
pan
pan
pan
some
one
knocks
three
times
with
a
harsh
and
bony
finger
against
one
of
the
steps
of
our
stairs
and
in
the
aperture
of
our
doorway
appears
an
idiot
clad
in
a
suit
of
gray
tweed
who
bows
low
come
in
come
in
kangourou
how
well
you
come
just
in
the
nick
of
time
i
was
actually
becoming
enthusiastic
over
your
country
it
was
a
little
washing
bill
which
kangourou
respectfully
wished
to
hand
to
me
with
a
profound
bend
of
the
whole
body
the
correct
pose
of
the
hands
on
the
knees
and
a
long
hiss
xxi
following
the
road
which
climbs
past
the
front
of
our
dwelling
one
passes
a
dozen
or
more
old
villas
a
few
garden
walls
and
then
there
is
nothing
but
the
lonely
mountain
side
with
little
paths
winding
upwards
towards
the
summit
through
plantations
of
tea
bushes
of
camellias
underwood
and
rocks
the
mountains
round
nagasaki
are
covered
with
cemeteries
for
centuries
and
centuries
past
it
is
up
here
they
have
brought
their
dead
but
there
is
neither
sadness
nor
horror
in
these
japanese
sepulchers
it
would
seem
as
if
among
this
frivolous
and
childish
people
death
itself
could
not
be
taken
seriously
the
monuments
are
either
buddhas
in
granite
seated
on
lotus
or
upright
funereal
stones
with
an
inscription
in
gold
they
are
grouped
together
in
little
enclosures
in
the
midst
of
the
woods
or
on
natural
terraces
delightfully
situated
and
are
generally
reached
by
long
stairways
of
stone
carpeted
with
moss
from
time
to
time
these
pass
under
one
of
the
sacred
gateways
of
which
the
shape
always
the
same
rude
and
simple
is
a
smaller
reproduction
of
those
in
the
temples
up
above
us
the
tombs
of
our
mountain
are
of
so
hoary
an
antiquity
that
they
no
longer
alarm
any
one
even
by
night
it
is
a
region
of
forsaken
cemeteries
the
dead
hidden
away
there
have
long
since
become
one
with
the
earth
around
them
and
these
thousands
of
little
gray
stones
these
multitudes
of
ancient
little
buddhas
eaten
away
by
lichens
seem
to
be
now
no
more
than
a
proof
of
a
series
of
existences
long
anterior
to
our
own
and
lost
forever
and
altogether
in
the
mysterious
depths
of
ages
xxii
chrysanthème
meals
are
something
indescribable
she
begins
in
the
morning
when
she
wakes
by
two
little
green
wild
plums
pickled
in
vinegar
and
rolled
in
powdered
sugar
a
cup
of
tea
completes
this
almost
traditional
breakfast
of
japan
the
very
same
madame
prune
is
eating
downstairs
the
same
served
up
to
travelers
in
the
inns
during
the
course
of
the
day
the
feeding
is
continued
by
two
little
dinners
of
the
drollest
composition
they
are
brought
up
on
a
tray
of
red
lacquer
in
microscopic
cups
with
covers
from
madame
apartment
where
they
are
cooked
a
hashed
sparrow
a
stuffed
prawn
seaweed
with
a
sauce
a
salt
sweetmeat
a
sugared
chili
chrysanthème
tastes
a
little
of
all
with
dainty
pecks
and
the
aid
of
her
little
chopsticks
raising
the
tips
of
her
fingers
with
affected
grace
at
every
dish
she
makes
a
face
leaves
three
parts
of
it
and
dries
her
after
it
in
apparent
disgust
these
menus
vary
according
to
the
inspiration
which
may
have
seized
madame
prune
but
one
thing
never
varies
either
in
our
household
or
in
any
other
neither
in
the
north
nor
in
the
south
of
the
empire
and
that
is
the
dessert
and
the
manner
of
eating
it
after
all
these
little
dishes
which
are
a
mere
is
brought
in
a
wooden
bowl
bound
with
copper
an
enormous
bowl
fit
for
gargantua
and
filled
to
the
very
brim
with
rice
plainly
cooked
in
water
chrysanthème
fills
another
large
bowl
from
it
sometimes
twice
sometimes
three
times
darkens
its
snowy
whiteness
with
a
black
sauce
flavored
with
fish
which
is
contained
in
a
delicately
shaped
blue
cruet
mixes
it
all
together
carries
the
bowl
to
her
lips
and
crams
down
all
the
rice
shoveling
it
with
her
two
chopsticks
into
her
very
throat
next
the
little
cups
and
covers
are
picked
up
as
well
as
the
tiniest
crumb
that
may
have
fallen
upon
the
white
mats
the
irreproachable
purity
of
which
nothing
is
allowed
to
tarnish
and
so
ends
the
dinner
xxiii
down
below
in
the
town
a
street
singer
had
established
herself
in
a
little
thoroughfare
people
had
collected
around
her
to
listen
to
her
singing
and
we
three
that
is
yves
chrysanthème
and
i
who
chanced
to
be
passing
stopped
like
others
quite
young
rather
fat
fairly
pretty
she
strummed
her
guitar
and
sang
rolling
her
eyes
fiercely
like
a
virtuoso
executing
feats
of
difficulty
she
lowered
her
head
stuck
her
chin
into
her
neck
in
order
to
draw
deeper
notes
from
the
furthermost
recesses
of
her
body
and
succeeded
in
bringing
forth
a
great
hoarse
voice
a
voice
that
might
have
belonged
to
an
aged
frog
a
ventriloquist
voice
coming
from
whence
it
would
be
impossible
to
say
this
is
the
best
stage
manner
the
final
word
of
art
for
the
interpretation
of
tragic
pieces
yves
cast
an
indignant
glance
upon
her
good
gracious
said
he
it
the
voice
of
a
words
failed
him
in
his
astonishment
it
the
voice
of
a
a
monster
and
he
looked
at
me
almost
frightened
by
this
little
being
and
anxious
to
know
what
i
thought
of
it
my
poor
yves
was
out
of
temper
on
this
occasion
because
i
had
induced
him
to
come
out
in
a
straw
hat
with
a
brim
which
did
not
please
him
it
suits
you
remarkably
well
yves
i
assure
you
oh
indeed
you
say
so
you
for
my
part
i
think
it
looks
like
a
magpie
nest
as
a
fortunate
diversion
from
the
singer
and
the
hat
here
comes
a
cortège
advancing
towards
us
from
the
end
of
the
street
something
remarkably
like
a
funeral
bonzes
march
in
front
dressed
in
robes
of
black
gauze
having
much
the
appearance
of
catholic
priests
the
principal
personage
of
the
procession
the
corpse
comes
last
laid
in
a
sort
of
little
closed
palanquin
which
is
daintily
pretty
this
is
followed
by
a
band
of
mousmés
hiding
their
laughing
faces
beneath
a
kind
of
veil
and
carrying
in
vases
of
the
sacred
shape
the
artificial
lotus
with
silver
petals
indispensable
at
a
funeral
then
come
fine
ladies
on
foot
smirking
and
stifling
a
wish
to
laugh
beneath
parasols
on
which
are
painted
in
the
gayest
colors
butterflies
and
storks
now
they
are
quite
close
to
us
we
must
stand
back
to
give
them
room
chrysanthème
all
at
once
assumes
a
suitable
air
of
gravity
and
yves
bares
his
head
taking
off
the
magpie
nest
yes
it
is
true
it
is
death
that
is
passing
by
i
had
almost
lost
sight
of
the
fact
so
little
does
this
recall
it
the
procession
will
climb
high
up
far
away
above
nagasaki
into
the
heart
of
the
green
mountain
all
peopled
with
tombs
there
the
poor
fellow
will
be
laid
at
rest
with
his
palanquin
above
him
and
his
vases
and
his
flowers
of
silvered
paper
well
at
least
the
poor
defunct
will
lie
in
a
charming
spot
commanding
a
lovely
view
they
will
now
return
half
laughing
half
sniveling
and
no
one
will
think
of
it
again
xxiv
the
which
has
been
lying
in
the
roadsteads
almost
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
on
which
stands
my
house
enters
the
dock
to
undergo
repairs
rendered
necessary
by
the
long
blockade
of
formosa
i
am
now
a
long
way
from
my
home
and
obliged
to
cross
by
boat
the
whole
breadth
of
the
bay
when
i
wish
to
see
chrysanthème
for
the
dock
is
situated
on
the
shore
opposite
to
it
is
sunk
in
a
little
valley
narrow
and
deep
midst
all
kinds
of
foliage
bamboos
camellias
trees
of
all
sorts
our
masts
and
spars
seen
from
the
deck
look
as
if
they
were
tangled
among
the
branches
the
situation
of
the
vessel
no
longer
afloat
gives
the
crew
a
greater
facility
for
clandestine
escapes
from
the
ship
at
no
matter
what
hour
of
the
night
and
our
sailors
have
made
friends
with
all
the
girls
of
the
villages
perched
on
the
mountains
above
us
these
quarters
and
his
excessive
liberty
give
me
some
uneasiness
about
my
poor
yves
for
this
country
of
frivolous
pleasure
has
a
little
turned
his
head
moreover
i
am
more
and
more
convinced
that
he
is
in
love
with
chrysanthème
it
is
really
a
pity
that
the
sentiment
has
not
occurred
to
me
instead
since
it
is
i
who
have
gone
the
length
of
marrying
her
xxv
notwithstanding
the
increased
distance
i
continue
my
daily
visits
to
when
night
has
fallen
and
the
four
couples
who
compose
our
society
have
joined
us
as
well
as
yves
and
the
tall
we
descend
again
into
the
town
stumbling
by
lantern
light
down
the
steep
stairways
and
slopes
of
the
old
suburb
this
nocturnal
stroll
is
always
the
same
and
accompanied
always
by
the
same
amusements
we
pause
before
the
same
queer
stalls
we
drink
the
same
sugared
drinks
served
to
us
in
the
same
little
gardens
but
our
troop
is
often
more
numerous
to
begin
with
we
chaperon
oyouki
who
is
confided
to
our
care
by
her
parents
then
we
have
two
cousins
of
my
wife
pretty
little
creatures
and
lastly
friends
guests
of
sometimes
only
ten
or
twelve
years
old
little
girls
of
the
neighborhood
to
whom
our
mousmés
wish
to
show
some
politeness
oh
what
a
singular
company
of
tiny
beings
forms
our
suite
and
follows
us
into
the
in
the
evenings
the
most
absurd
faces
with
sprigs
of
flowers
stuck
in
the
oddest
fashion
in
their
comical
and
childish
heads
one
might
suppose
it
was
a
whole
school
of
mousmés
out
for
an
evening
frolic
under
our
care
yves
returns
with
us
when
time
comes
to
remount
our
hill
chrysanthème
heaves
great
sighs
like
a
tired
child
and
stops
on
every
step
leaning
on
our
arms
when
we
have
reached
our
destination
he
says
just
touches
chrysanthème
hand
and
descending
once
more
by
the
slope
which
leads
to
the
quays
and
the
shipping
he
crosses
the
roadstead
in
a
sampan
to
get
on
board
the
meantime
we
with
the
aid
of
a
sort
of
secret
key
open
the
door
of
our
garden
where
madame
prune
pots
of
flowers
ranged
in
the
darkness
send
forth
delicious
odors
in
the
night
air
we
cross
the
garden
by
moonlight
or
starlight
and
mount
to
our
own
rooms
if
it
is
very
late
a
frequent
occurrence
we
find
all
our
wooden
panels
drawn
and
tightly
shut
by
the
careful
sucre
as
a
precaution
against
thieves
and
our
apartment
is
as
close
and
as
private
as
if
it
were
a
real
european
one
in
this
house
when
every
chink
is
thus
closed
a
strange
odor
mingles
with
the
musk
and
the
lotus
an
odor
essential
to
japan
to
the
yellow
race
belonging
to
the
soil
or
emanating
from
the
venerable
woodwork
almost
an
odor
of
wild
beast
the
mosquito
curtain
of
dark
blue
gauze
ready
hung
for
the
night
falls
from
the
ceiling
with
the
air
of
a
mysterious
velum
the
gilded
buddha
smiles
eternally
at
the
burning
before
him
some
great
moth
a
constant
frequenter
of
the
house
which
during
the
day
sleeps
clinging
to
our
ceiling
flutters
at
this
hour
under
the
very
nose
of
the
god
turning
and
flitting
round
the
thin
quivering
flames
and
motionless
on
the
wall
its
feelers
spread
out
starwise
sleeps
some
great
garden
spider
which
one
must
not
kill
because
it
is
night
hou
says
chrysanthème
indignantly
pointing
it
out
to
me
with
leveled
finger
quick
where
is
the
fan
kept
for
the
purpose
wherewith
to
hunt
it
out
of
doors
around
us
reigns
a
silence
which
is
almost
painful
after
all
the
joyous
noises
of
the
town
and
all
the
laughter
now
hushed
of
our
band
of
mousmés
a
silence
of
the
country
of
some
sleeping
village
xxvi
the
noise
of
the
innumerable
wooden
panels
which
at
the
fall
of
night
are
pulled
and
shut
in
every
japanese
house
is
one
of
the
peculiarities
of
the
country
which
will
remain
longest
imprinted
on
my
memory
from
our
neighbors
houses
floating
to
us
over
the
green
gardens
these
noises
reach
us
one
after
the
other
in
series
more
or
less
deadened
more
or
less
distant
just
below
us
those
of
madame
prune
move
very
badly
creak
and
make
a
hideous
noise
in
their
grooves
ours
are
somewhat
noisy
too
for
the
old
house
is
full
of
echoes
and
there
are
at
least
twenty
to
run
over
long
slides
in
order
to
close
in
completely
the
kind
of
open
hall
in
which
we
live
generally
it
is
chrysanthème
who
undertakes
this
piece
of
household
work
and
a
great
deal
of
trouble
it
gives
her
for
she
often
pinches
her
fingers
in
the
singular
awkwardness
of
her
too
tiny
hands
which
have
never
been
accustomed
to
do
any
work
then
comes
her
toilette
for
the
night
with
a
certain
grace
she
lets
fall
the
and
slips
on
a
more
simple
one
of
blue
cotton
which
has
the
same
pagoda
sleeves
the
same
shape
all
but
the
train
and
which
she
fastens
round
her
waist
by
a
sash
of
muslin
of
the
same
color
the
high
remains
untouched
it
is
needless
to
say
all
but
the
pins
which
are
taken
out
and
laid
beside
her
in
a
lacquer
box
then
there
is
the
little
silver
pipe
that
must
absolutely
be
smoked
before
going
to
sleep
this
is
one
of
the
customs
which
most
provokes
me
but
has
to
be
borne
chrysanthème
like
a
gypsy
squats
before
a
particular
square
box
made
of
red
wood
which
contains
a
little
tobacco
jar
a
little
porcelain
stove
full
of
hot
embers
and
finally
a
little
bamboo
pot
serving
at
the
same
time
as
and
spittoon
madame
downstairs
and
every
in
japan
both
of
men
and
women
is
exactly
the
same
and
contains
precisely
the
same
objects
arranged
in
precisely
the
same
manner
and
wherever
it
may
be
whether
in
the
house
of
the
rich
or
the
poor
it
always
lies
about
somewhere
on
the
floor
the
word
pipe
is
at
once
too
trivial
and
too
big
to
be
applied
to
this
delicate
silver
tube
which
is
perfectly
straight
and
at
the
end
of
which
in
a
microscopic
receptacle
is
placed
one
pinch
of
golden
tobacco
chopped
finer
than
silken
thread
two
puffs
or
at
most
three
it
lasts
scarcely
a
few
seconds
and
the
pipe
is
finished
then
pan
pan
pan
the
little
tube
is
struck
smartly
against
the
edge
of
the
to
knock
out
the
ashes
which
never
will
fall
and
this
tapping
heard
everywhere
in
every
house
at
every
hour
of
the
day
or
night
quick
and
droll
as
the
scratching
of
a
monkey
is
in
japan
one
of
the
noises
most
characteristic
of
human
life
anata
nominasé
you
must
smoke
too
says
chrysanthème
having
again
filled
the
vexatious
little
pipe
she
puts
the
silver
tube
to
my
lips
with
a
bow
courtesy
forbids
my
refusal
but
i
find
it
detestably
bitter
now
before
laying
myself
down
under
the
blue
i
open
two
of
the
panels
in
the
room
one
on
the
side
of
the
silent
and
deserted
footpath
the
other
one
on
the
garden
side
overlooking
the
terraces
so
that
the
night
air
may
breathe
upon
us
even
at
the
risk
of
bringing
us
the
company
of
some
belated
cockchafer
or
more
giddy
moth
our
wooden
house
with
its
thin
old
walls
vibrates
at
night
like
a
great
dry
fiddle
the
slightest
noises
grow
great
in
it
become
disfigured
and
positively
disquieting
beneath
the
verandah
are
hung
two
little
æolian
harps
which
at
the
least
ruffle
of
the
breeze
running
through
their
blades
of
grass
emit
a
gentle
tinkling
sound
like
the
harmonious
murmur
of
a
brook
outside
to
the
very
furthest
limits
of
the
distance
the
cicalas
continue
their
great
and
everlasting
concert
over
our
heads
on
the
black
roof
is
heard
passing
like
a
witch
sabbath
the
raging
battle
to
the
death
of
cats
rats
and
owls
presently
when
in
the
early
dawn
a
fresher
breeze
mounting
upwards
from
the
sea
and
the
deep
harbor
reaches
us
chrysanthème
will
slyly
get
up
and
shut
the
panels
i
have
opened
before
that
however
she
will
have
risen
at
least
three
times
to
smoke
having
yawned
like
a
cat
stretched
herself
twisted
in
every
direction
her
little
amber
arms
and
her
graceful
little
hands
she
sits
up
resolutely
with
all
the
waking
groans
and
half
words
of
a
child
pretty
and
fascinating
enough
then
she
emerges
from
the
gauze
tent
fills
her
little
pipe
and
breathes
a
few
puffs
of
the
bitter
and
unpleasant
mixture
then
comes
pan
pan
pan
against
the
box
to
shake
out
the
ashes
in
the
resounding
sonority
of
the
night
it
makes
quite
a
terrible
noise
which
wakes
madame
prune
this
is
fatal
madame
prune
is
at
once
seized
also
with
a
longing
to
smoke
which
may
not
be
denied
then
to
the
noise
from
above
comes
an
answering
pan
pan
pan
from
below
exactly
like
it
exasperating
and
inevitable
as
an
echo
xxvii
more
cheerful
are
the
noises
of
the
morning
the
cocks
crowing
the
wooden
panels
all
round
the
neighborhood
sliding
back
upon
their
rollers
or
the
strange
cry
of
some
little
patrolling
our
lofty
suburb
in
the
early
dawn
and
the
grasshoppers
absolutely
seem
to
chirp
more
loudly
to
celebrate
the
return
of
the
sunlight
above
all
rises
to
our
ears
from
below
the
sound
of
madame
long
prayers
ascending
through
the
floor
monotonous
as
the
song
of
a
somnambulist
regular
and
soothing
as
the
splash
of
a
fountain
it
lasts
of
an
hour
at
least
it
drones
along
a
rapid
flow
of
words
in
a
high
nasal
key
from
time
to
time
when
the
inattentive
spirits
are
not
listening
it
is
accompanied
by
a
clapping
of
dry
palms
or
by
harsh
sounds
from
a
kind
of
wooden
clapper
made
of
two
discs
of
mandragora
root
it
is
an
uninterrupted
stream
of
prayer
its
flow
never
ceases
and
the
quavering
continues
without
stopping
like
the
bleating
of
an
old
in
delirium
after
having
washed
the
hands
and
feet
say
the
sacred
books
the
great
god
who
is
the
royal
power
of
japan
must
be
invoked
the
manes
of
all
the
defunct

must
also
be
invoked
next
the
manes
of
all
his
personal

the

and

in
her
trembling
old
woman
falsetto
madame
prune
sings
out
all
this
without
omitting
anything
at
a
pace
which
almost
takes
away
her
breath
and
very
strange
it
is
to
hear
at
length
it
seems
hardly
a
human
voice
it
sounds
like
a
series
of
magic
formulas
unwinding
themselves
from
an
inexhaustible
roller
and
escaping
to
take
flight
through
the
air
by
its
very
weirdness
and
by
the
persistency
of
its
incantation
it
ends
by
producing
in
my
scarcely
awakened
brain
an
almost
religious
impression
every
day
i
wake
to
the
sound
of
this
shintoist
litany
chanted
beneath
me
vibrating
through
the
exquisite
clearness
of
the
summer
mornings
while
our
burn
low
before
the
smiling
buddha
while
the
eternal
sun
scarcely
risen
already
sends
through
the
cracks
of
our
wooden
panels
its
bright
rays
which
dart
like
golden
arrows
through
our
darkened
dwelling
and
our
blue
gauze
tent
this
is
the
moment
at
which
i
must
rise
descend
hurriedly
to
the
sea
by
grassy
footpaths
all
wet
with
dew
and
so
regain
my
ship
alas
in
the
days
gone
by
it
was
the
cry
of
the
muezzin
which
used
to
awaken
me
in
the
dark
winter
mornings
in
stamboul
xxviii
chrysanthème
has
brought
but
few
things
with
her
knowing
that
our
married
life
would
be
of
short
duration
she
has
placed
her
dresses
and
her
fine
sashes
in
little
closed
recesses
hidden
in
one
of
the
walls
of
our
apartment
the
north
wall
the
only
one
of
the
four
which
will
not
take
to
pieces
the
doors
of
these
niches
are
white
paper
panels
the
standing
shelves
and
inside
partitions
consisting
of
light
woodwork
are
put
together
in
too
finical
a
manner
too
ingenious
a
way
giving
rise
to
suspicions
of
secret
drawers
and
conjuring
tricks
we
only
put
there
things
without
any
value
having
a
vague
feeling
that
the
cupboards
themselves
might
spirit
them
away
the
box
in
which
chrysanthème
stores
away
her
gewgaws
and
letters
is
one
of
the
things
that
amuses
me
the
most
it
is
of
english
origin
in
tin
and
bears
on
its
cover
the
colored
representation
of
some
manufactory
in
the
neighborhood
of
london
of
course
it
is
as
an
exotic
work
of
art
as
a
precious
that
chrysanthème
prefers
it
to
any
of
her
other
boxes
in
lacquer
or
inlaid
work
it
contains
all
that
a
mousmé
requires
for
her
correspondence
indian
ink
a
paintbrush
very
thin
gray
tinted
paper
cut
up
in
long
narrow
strips
and
funnily
shaped
envelopes
into
which
these
strips
are
slipped
after
having
been
folded
up
in
some
thirty
folds
the
envelopes
being
ornamented
with
pictures
of
landscapes
fishes
crabs
or
birds
on
some
old
letters
addressed
to
her
i
can
make
out
the
two
characters
that
represent
her
name
chrysanthème
madame
and
when
i
question
her
she
replies
in
japanese
with
an
air
of
importance
my
dear
creature
they
are
letters
from
my
female
friends
oh
those
friends
of
chrysanthème
what
funny
little
faces
they
have
that

contains
their
portraits
their
photographs
stuck
on
visiting
cards
which
are
printed
on
the
back
with
the
name

assume
a
dignified
attitude
when
once
their
necks
have
been
placed
in

this
evening
it
rained
heavily
and
the
night
was
thick
and
black
at
about
ten
on
our
return
from
one
of
the
fashionable
we
constantly
frequent
we
arrived
yves
chrysanthème
and
myself
at
the
certain
familiar
angle
of
the
principal
street
the
certain
turn
where
we
must
take
leave
of
the
lights
and
noises
of
the
town
to
clamber
up
the
black
steps
and
steep
lanes
which
lead
to
our
home
at
there
before
beginning
our
ascension
we
must
first
buy
lanterns
from
an
old
called
madame
e
whose
faithful
customers
we
are
it
is
amazing
what
a
quantity
of
these
paper
lanterns
we
consume
they
are
invariably
decorated
in
the
same
way
with
painted
or
bats
fastened
to
the
ceiling
at
the
further
end
of
the
shop
they
hang
in
enormous
clusters
and
the
old
woman
seeing
us
arrive
gets
upon
a
table
to
take
them
down
gray
or
red
are
our
usual
choice
madame
knows
our
preferences
and
leaves
the
green
or
blue
lanterns
aside
but
it
is
always
hard
work
to
unhook
one
on
account
of
the
little
short
sticks
by
which
they
are
held
and
the
strings
by
which
they
are
tied
getting
entangled
together
in
an
exaggerated
pantomime
madame
expresses
her
despair
at
wasting
so
much
of
our
valuable
time
oh
if
it
only
depended
on
her
personal
efforts
but
ah
for
the
natural
perversity
of
inanimate
things
which
have
no
consideration
for
human
dignity
with
monkeyish
antics
she
even
deems
it
her
duty
to
threaten
the
lanterns
and
shake
her
fist
at
these
inextricably
tangled
strings
which
have
the
presumption
to
delay
us
it
is
all
very
well
but
we
know
this
maneuver
by
heart
and
if
the
old
lady
loses
patience
so
do
we
chrysanthème
who
is
half
asleep
is
seized
with
a
fit
of
yawning
which
she
does
not
even
trouble
to
hide
behind
her
hand
and
which
appears
to
be
endless
she
pulls
a
very
long
face
at
the
thought
of
the
steep
hill
we
must
struggle
up
through
the
pelting
rain

under
my
fantastic
umbrella
on
each
side
of
the
road
is
heard
the
roaring
torrent
of
stormy
waters
rolling
down
from
the
mountain
side
the
way
seems
long
difficult
and
slippery
a
succession
of
interminable
flights
of
steps
gardens
and
houses
piled
up
one
above
another
waste
lands
and
trees
which
in
the
darkness
shake
their
dripping
foliage
on
our
heads
one
would
say
that
nagasaki
is
ascending
at
the
same
time
as
ourselves
but
yonder
and
very
far
away
in
a
kind
of
vapory
mist
which
seems
luminous
on
the
blackness
of
the
sky
and
from
the
town
there
rises
a
confused
murmur
of
voices
and
rumbling
of
gongs
and
laughter
the
summer
rain
has
not
yet
refreshed
the
atmosphere
on
account
of
the
stormy
heat
the
little
suburban
houses
have
been
left
open
like
sheds
and
we
can
see
all
that
is
going
on
lamps
ever
lighted
burn
before
the
altars
dedicated
to
buddha
and
to
the
souls
of
the
ancestors
but
all
good
niponese
have
already
lain
down
to
rest
under
the
traditional
tents
of
gauze
we
can
see
them
stretched
out
in
rows
by
whole
families
they
are
either
sleeping
or
hunting
the
mosquitoes
or
fanning
themselves
niponese
men
and
women
niponese
babies
too
lying
side
by
side
with
their
parents
each
one
young
or
old
in
his
little
cotton
and
with
his
little
wooden
block
to
rest
the
nape
of
his
neck
a
few
houses
are
open
where
amusements
are
still
going
on
here
and
there
from
the
somber
gardens
the
sound
of
a
guitar
reaches
our
ears
some
dance
giving
in
its
weird
rhythm
a
strange
impression
of
sadness
here
is
the
well
surrounded
by
bamboos
where
we
are
wont
to
make
a
nocturnal
halt
for
chrysanthème
to
take
breath
yves
begs
me
to
throw
forward
the
red
gleam
of
my
lantern
in
order
to
recognize
the
place
for
it
marks
our
resting
place
and
at
last
at
last
here
is
our
house
the
door
is
closed
all
is
silent
and
black
our
panels
have
been
carefully
shut
by
sucre
and
madame
prune
the
rain
streams
down
the
wood
of
our
old
black
walls
in
such
weather
it
is
impossible
to
allow
yves
to
return
down
hill
and
wander
along
the
shore
in
quest
of
a
sampan
no
he
shall
not
return
on
board
we
will
put
him
up
in
our
house
his
little
room
has
indeed
been
already
provided
for
in
the
conditions
of
our
lease
and
notwithstanding
his
discreet
refusal
we
immediately
set
to
work
to
make
it
let
us
go
in
take
off
our
boots
shake
ourselves
like
so
many
cats
that
have
been
out
in
a
shower
and
step
up
to
our
apartment
in
front
of
buddha
the
little
lamps
are
burning
in
the
middle
of
the
room
the
gauze
is
stretched
on
entering
the
first
impression
is
a
favorable
one
our
dwelling
is
pretty
this
evening
the
late
hour
and
deep
silence
give
it
an
air
of
mystery
and
then
also
in
such
weather
it
is
always
pleasant
to
get
home
come
let
us
at
once
prepare
yves
room
chrysanthème
quite
elated
at
the
prospect
of
having
her
big
friend
near
her
sets
to
work
with
a
good
will
moreover
the
task
is
an
easy
one
we
have
only
to
slip
three
or
four
paper
panels
in
their
grooves
to
make
at
once
a
separate
room
or
compartment
in
the
great
box
we
live
in
i
had
thought
that
these
panels
were
entirely
white
but
no
on
each
of
them
is
a
group
of
two
storks
painted
in
gray
tints
in
those
inevitable
attitudes
consecrated
by
japanese
art
one
bearing
aloft
its
proud
head
and
haughtily
raising
its
leg
the
other
scratching
itself
oh
these
storks
how
sick
one
gets
of
them
at
the
end
of
a
month
spent
in
japan
yves
is
now
in
bed
and
sleeping
under
our
roof
sleep
has
come
to
him
sooner
than
to
me
for
somehow
i
fancy
i
had
seen
long
glances
exchanged
between
him
and
chrysanthème
i
have
left
this
little
creature
in
his
hands
like
a
toy
and
i
begin
to
fear
lest
i
should
have
thrown
some
perturbation
in
his
mind
i
do
not
trouble
my
head
about
this
little
japanese
girl
but
yves
it
would
be
decidedly
wrong
on
his
part
and
would
greatly
diminish
my
faith
in
him
we
hear
the
rain
falling
on
our
old
roof
the
cicalas
are
mute
odors
of
wet
earth
reach
us
from
the
gardens
and
the
mountain
i
feel
terribly
dreary
in
this
room
the
noise
of
the
little
pipe
irritates
me
more
than
usual
and
as
chrysanthème
crouches
in
front
of
her
i
suddenly
discover
in
her
an
air
of
low
breeding
in
the
very
worst
sense
of
the
word
i
should
hate
her
my
mousmé
if
she
were
to
entice
yves
into
committing
a
fault
a
fault
which
i
should
perhaps
never
be
able
to
forgive
xxx
the
y
and
couple
were
divorced
yesterday
the
charles
n
and
campanule
household
is
getting
on
very
badly
they
have
had
some
annoyance
with
those
prying
grinding
insupportable
little
men
dressed
up
in
suits
of
gray
who
are
called
police
agents
and
who
by
threatening
their
landlord
have
had
them
turned
out
of
their
house
under
the
obsequious
amiability
of
this
people
there
lurks
a
secret
hatred
towards
us
europeans
they
are
therefore
obliged
to
accept
their
hospitality
a
very
painful
position
and
then
charles
n
fancies
his
wife
is
faithless
it
is
hardly
possible
however
for
us
to
deceive
ourselves
these
maidens
to
whom
kangourou
has
introduced
us
are
young
people
who
have
already
had
in
their
lives
one
or
perhaps
more
than
one
adventure
it
is
therefore
only
natural
that
we
should
have
our
suspicions
the
z
and
couple
jog
on
quarreling
all
the
time
my
household
maintains
a
more
dignified
air
though
it
is
none
the
less
dreary
i
had
indeed
thought
of
a
divorce
but
have
really
no
good
reason
for
offering
chrysanthème
such
a
gratuitous
affront
moreover
there
is
another
more
imperative
reason
why
i
should
remain
quiet
i
too
have
had
difficulties
with
the
civilian
authorities
day
before
yesterday
sucre
quite
upset
madame
prune
almost
swooning
and
mdlle
oyouki
bathed
in
tears
stormed
my
rooms
the
niponese
police
agents
had
called
and
threatened
them
with
the
law
for
letting
rooms
outside
of
the
european
concession
to
a
frenchman
morganatically
married
to
a
japanese
and
the
terror
of
being
prosecuted
brought
them
to
me
with
a
thousand
apologies
but
the
humble
request
that
i
should
leave
the
next
day
i
therefore
went
off
accompanied
by
wonderfully
tall
who
expresses
himself
better
than
i
do
in
japanese
to
the
register
office
with
the
full
intention
of
making
a
terrible
row
in
the
language
of
this
exquisitely
polite
people
terms
of
abuse
are
totally
wanting
when
very
angry
one
is
obliged
to
be
satisfied
with
using
the
mark
of
and
the
habitual
towards
those
of
low
birth
seating
myself
on
the
table
used
for
weddings
in
the
midst
of
all
the
flurried
little
policemen
i
open
the
conversation
in
the
following
terms
in
order
that
leave
me
in
peace
in
the
suburb
i
am
inhabiting
what
bribe
must
i
offer
set
of
little
beings
more
contemptible
than
any
mere
street
porter
great
and
mute
scandal
silent
consternation
and
low
bows
greet
my
words
certainly
they
at
last
reply
my
honorable
person
shall
not
be
molested
indeed
they
ask
for
nothing
better
only
in
order
to
subscribe
to
the
laws
of
the
country
i
ought
to
have
come
here
and
given
my
name
and
that
of
the
young
person
that
with
whom
oh
that
is
going
too
far
i
came
here
on
purpose
contemptible
creatures
not
three
weeks
ago
then
taking
up
myself
the
civil
register
and
turning
over
the
pages
rapidly
i
found
my
signature
and
beside
it
the
little
hieroglyphics
drawn
by
chrysanthème
there
set
of
idiots
look
at
that
arrival
of
a
very
high
functionary
a
ridiculous
little
old
fellow
in
a
black
coat
who
from
his
office
has
been
listening
to
the
row
what
is
the
matter
what
is
it
what
is
this
annoyance
put
upon
the
french
officers
i
politely
state
my
case
to
this
personage
who
can
not
make
apologies
and
promises
enough
the
little
agents
prostrate
themselves
on
all
fours
sink
into
the
earth
and
we
leave
them
cold
and
dignified
without
returning
their
bows
sucre
and
madame
prune
can
now
make
their
minds
easy
they
will
not
be
disturbed
again
xxxi
the
prolonged
stay
of
the
in
the
dock
and
the
distance
of
our
home
from
town
have
been
my
pretext
these
last
two
or
three
days
for
not
going
up
to
to
see
chrysanthème
it
is
dreary
work
though
in
these
docks
with
the
early
dawn
a
legion
of
little
japanese
workmen
invade
us
bringing
their
dinners
in
baskets
and
gourds
like
the
in
our
arsenals
but
with
a
needy
shabby
appearance
and
a
ferreting
hurried
manner
which
reminds
one
of
rats
silently
they
slip
under
the
keel
at
the
bottom
of
the
hold
in
all
the
holes
sawing
nailing
repairing
the
heat
is
intense
in
this
spot
overshadowed
by
the
rocks
and
tangled
masses
of
foliage
at
two
in
the
broad
sunlight
we
have
a
new
and
far
prettier
kind
of
invasion
that
of
the
beetles
and
butterflies
butterflies
as
wonderful
as
those
on
the
fans
some
all
black
giddily
dash
up
against
us
so
light
and
airy
that
they
seem
merely
a
pair
of
quivering
wings
fastened
together
without
any
body
yves
astonished
gazes
at
them
saying
in
his
boyish
manner
oh
i
saw
such
a
big
one
just
now
such
a
big
one
it
quite
frightened
me
i
thought
it
was
a
bat
attacking
me
a
steersman
who
has
captured
a
very
curious
specimen
carries
it
off
carefully
to
press
between
the
leaves
of
his
like
a
flower
another
sailor
passing
by
taking
his
small
roast
to
the
oven
in
a
looks
at
him
funnily
and
says
you
had
much
better
give
it
to
me
i
cook
it
xxxii
it
is
nearly
five
days
since
i
have
abandoned
my
home
and
chrysanthème
since
yesterday
we
have
had
a
storm
of
rain
and
wind
a
typhoon
that
has
passed
or
is
passing
over
us
we
beat
to
quarters
in
the
middle
of
the
night
to
the
strike
the
lower
and
take
every
precaution
against
bad
weather
the
butterflies
no
longer
hover
around
us
but
everything
tosses
and
writhes
overhead
on
the
steep
slopes
of
the
mountain
the
trees
shiver
the
long
grasses
bend
low
as
though
in
pain
terrible
gusts
rack
them
with
a
hissing
sound
branches
bamboo
leaves
and
earth
are
showered
down
like
rain
upon
us
in
this
land
of
pretty
little
trifles
this
violent
tempest
is
out
of
all
harmony
it
seems
as
if
its
efforts
were
exaggerated
and
its
music
too
loud
towards
evening
the
big
dark
clouds
roll
by
so
rapidly
that
the
showers
are
of
short
duration
and
soon
pass
over
then
i
attempt
a
walk
on
the
mountain
above
us
in
the
wet
verdure
little
pathways
lead
up
it
between
thickets
of
camellias
and
bamboos
waiting
till
a
shower
is
over
i
take
refuge
in
the
courtyard
of
an
old
temple
up
the
hill
buried
in
a
wood
of
centennial
trees
of
gigantic
branches
it
is
reached
by
granite
steps
through
strange
gateways
as
deeply
furrowed
as
the
old
celtic
dolmens
the
trees
have
also
invaded
this
yard
the
daylight
is
overcast
with
a
greenish
tint
and
the
drenching
rain
that
pours
down
in
torrents
is
full
of
leaves
and
moss
old
granite
monsters
of
unknown
shapes
are
seated
in
the
corners
and
grimace
with
smiling
ferocity
their
faces
are
full
of
indefinable
mystery
that
makes
me
shudder
amid
the
moaning
music
of
the
wind
in
the
gloomy
shadows
of
the
clouds
and
branches
they
could
not
have
resembled
the
japanese
of
our
day
the
men
who
had
thus
conceived
these
ancient
temples
who
built
them
everywhere
and
filled
the
country
with
them
even
in
its
most
solitary
nooks
an
hour
later
in
the
twilight
of
that
stormy
day
on
the
same
mountain
i
chanced
upon
a
clump
of
trees
somewhat
similar
to
oaks
in
appearance
they
too
have
been
twisted
by
the
tempest
and
the
tufts
of
undulating
grass
at
their
feet
are
laid
low
tossed
about
in
every
direction
there
i
suddenly
have
brought
back
to
my
mind
my
first
impression
of
a
strong
wind
in
the
woods
of
limoise
in
the
province
of
saintonge
some
years
ago
in
a
month
of
march
of
my
childhood
that
the
first
storm
of
wind
my
eyes
ever
beheld
sweeping
over
the
landscape
blew
in
just
the
opposite
quarter
of
the
world
and
many
years
have
rapidly
passed
over
that
memory
since
then
the
best
part
of
my
life
has
been
spent
i
refer
too
often
i
fancy
to
my
childhood
i
am
foolishly
fond
of
it
but
it
seems
to
me
that
then
only
did
i
truly
experience
sensations
or
impressions
the
smallest
trifles
i
then
saw
or
heard
were
full
of
deep
and
hidden
meaning
recalling
past
images
out
of
oblivion
and
reawakening
memories
of
prior
existence
or
else
they
were
presentiments
of
existences
to
come
future
incarnations
in
the
land
of
dreams
expectations
of
wondrous
marvels
that
life
and
the
world
held
in
store
for
me
for
later
no
doubt
when
i
should
be
grown
up
well
i
have
grown
up
and
have
found
nothing
that
answered
to
my
undefinable
expectations
on
the
contrary
all
has
narrowed
and
darkened
around
me
my
vague
recollections
of
the
past
have
become
blurred
the
horizons
before
me
have
slowly
closed
in
and
become
full
of
a
gray
darkness
soon
will
my
time
come
to
return
to
eternal
rest
and
i
shall
leave
this
world
without
having
understood
the
mysterious
wherefore
of
these
mirages
of
my
childhood
i
shall
bear
away
with
me
a
lingering
regret
of
i
know
not
what
lost
home
that
i
have
failed
to
find
of
the
unknown
beings
ardently
longed
for
whom
alas
i
have
never
embraced
xxxiii
with
many
affectations
sucre
has
dipped
the
tip
of
his
delicate
in
indian
ink
and
traced
a
couple
of
charming
storks
on
a
pretty
sheet
of
offering
them
to
me
in
the
most
gracious
manner
as
a
souvenir
of
himself
they
are
here
in
my
cabin
on
board
and
whenever
i
look
at
them
i
can
fancy
i
see
sucre
tracing
them
in
an
airy
manner
with
elegant
facility
the
saucer
in
which
sucre
mixes
his
ink
is
in
itself
a
little
gem
chiselled
out
of
a
piece
of
jade
it
represents
a
tiny
lake
with
a
carved
border
imitating
rockwork
on
this
border
is
a
little
mama
toad
also
in
jade
advancing
as
though
to
bathe
in
the
little
lake
in
which
sucre
carefully
keeps
a
few
drops
of
very
dark
liquid
the
mama
toad
has
four
little
baby
toads
equally
in
jade
one
perched
on
her
head
the
other
three
playing
about
under
her
sucre
has
painted
many
a
stork
in
the
course
of
his
lifetime
and
he
really
excels
in
reproducing
groups
and
duets
if
one
may
so
express
it
of
this
kind
of
bird
few
japanese
possess
the
art
of
interpreting
this
subject
in
a
manner
at
once
so
rapid
and
so
tasteful
first
he
draws
the
two
beaks
then
the
four
claws
then
the
backs
the
feathers
dash
dash
dash
with
a
dozen
strokes
of
his
clever
brush
held
in
his
daintily
posed
hand
it
is
done
and
always
perfectly
well
done
kangourou
relates
without
seeing
anything
wrong
in
it
whatever
that
formerly
this
talent
was
of
great
service
to
sucre
it
appears
that
madame
prune
how
shall
i
say
such
a
thing
and
who
could
guess
it
now
on
beholding
so
devout
and
sedate
an
old
lady
with
eyebrows
so
scrupulously
shaven
however
it
appears
that
madame
prune
used
to
receive
a
great
many
visits
from
gentlemen
gentlemen
who
always
came
alone
and
it
led
to
some
gossip
therefore
when
madame
prune
was
engaged
with
one
visitor
if
a
new
arrival
made
his
appearance
the
ingenious
husband
to
make
him
wait
patiently
and
to
while
away
the
time
in
the
immediately
offered
to
paint
him
some
storks
in
a
variety
of
attitudes
and
this
is
how
in
nagasaki
all
the
japanese
gentlemen
of
a
certain
age
have
in
their
collections
two
or
three
of
these
little
pictures
for
which
they
are
indebted
to
the
delicate
and
original
talent
of
sucre
xxxiv
august
at
about
six
while
i
was
on
duty
the
left
her
prison
walls
between
the
mountains
and
came
out
of
dock
after
a
great
uproar
of
maneuvering
we
took
up
our
old
moorings
in
the
roadstead
at
the
foot
of
the
hills
the
weather
was
again
calm
and
cloudless
the
sky
presenting
a
peculiar
clearness
as
though
it
had
been
swept
clean
by
the
cyclone
an
exceeding
transparency
bringing
out
the
minutest
details
of
the
far
distance
till
then
unseen
as
if
the
terrible
blast
had
blown
away
every
vestige
of
the
floating
mists
and
left
behind
it
nothing
but
void
and
boundless
space
the
coloring
of
woods
and
mountains
stood
out
again
in
the
resplendent
verdancy
of
spring
after
the
torrents
of
rain
like
the
wet
colors
of
some
freshly
washed
painting
the
sampans
and
junks
which
for
the
last
three
days
had
been
lying
under
shelter
had
now
put
out
to
sea
and
the
bay
was
covered
with
their
white
sails
which
looked
like
an
immense
flight
of
seabirds
at
eight
at
nightfall
our
maneuver
being
at
an
end
i
embarked
with
yves
on
board
a
sampan
this
time
it
is
he
who
is
carrying
me
off
and
taking
me
back
to
my
home
on
land
a
delicious
perfume
of
hay
greets
us
and
the
road
across
the
mountains
lies
bathed
in
glorious
moonlight
we
go
straight
up
to
to
join
chrysanthème
i
feel
almost
remorseful
although
i
hardly
show
it
for
my
neglect
of
her
looking
up
i
recognize
from
afar
my
little
house
perched
on
high
it
is
wide
open
and
lit
up
i
even
hear
the
sound
of
guitar
then
i
perceive
the
gilt
head
of
my
buddha
between
the
little
bright
flames
of
its
two
hanging
night
lamps
now
chrysanthème
appears
on
the
verandah
looking
out
as
if
she
expected
us
and
with
her
wonderful
bows
of
hair
and
long
falling
sleeves
her
silhouette
is
thoroughly
niponese
as
i
enter
she
comes
forward
to
kiss
me
in
a
graceful
though
rather
hesitating
manner
while
oyouki
more
demonstrative
throws
her
arms
around
me
it
is
with
a
certain
pleasure
that
i
see
once
more
this
japanese
home
which
i
wonder
to
find
still
mine
when
i
had
almost
forgotten
its
existence
chrysanthème
has
put
fresh
flowers
in
our
vases
spread
out
her
hair
donned
her
best
clothes
and
lighted
our
lamps
to
honor
my
return
from
the
balcony
she
had
watched
the
leave
the
dock
and
in
the
expectation
of
our
now
prompt
return
she
had
made
her
preparations
then
to
while
away
the
time
she
was
studying
a
duet
on
the
guitar
with
oyouki
not
a
question
or
reproach
did
she
make
on
the
contrary
we
quite
understood
she
said
how
impossible
it
was
in
such
dreadful
weather
to
undertake
so
lengthy
a
crossing
in
a
sampan
she
smiled
like
a
pleased
child
and
i
should
be
fastidious
indeed
if
i
did
not
admit
that
she
is
charming
i
announce
my
intention
of
starting
off
for
a
long
stroll
through
nagasaki
we
will
take
and
two
little
cousins
who
happen
to
be
there
as
well
as
some
other
neighbors
if
they
wish
to
we
will
buy
the
funniest
toys
eat
all
sorts
of
cakes
and
amuse
ourselves
to
our
hearts
content
how
lucky
we
are
to
be
here
just
at
the
right
moment
they
exclaim
jumping
with
joy
how
fortunate
we
are
this
very
evening
there
is
to
be
a
pilgrimage
to
the
great
temple
of
the
tortoise
the
whole
town
will
be
there
all
our
married
friends
have
already
started
the
whole
set
x
y
z
campanule
and
jonquille
with
friend
of
amazing
and
those
two
poor
chrysanthème
and
poor
oyouki
would
have
been
obliged
to
stay
at
home
with
heavy
hearts
because
we
had
not
yet
arrived
and
because
madame
prune
had
been
seized
with
faintness
and
hysterics
after
her
dinner
quickly
the
mousmés
must
deck
themselves
out
chrysanthème
is
ready
oyouki
hurries
changes
her
dress
and
putting
on
a
gray
robe
begs
me
to
arrange
the
bows
of
her
fine
sash
black
satin
lined
with
yellow
sticking
at
the
same
time
in
her
hair
a
silver
we
light
our
lanterns
swinging
at
the
end
of
little
sticks
sucre
overwhelming
us
with
thanks
for
his
daughter
accompanies
us
on
all
fours
to
the
door
and
we
go
off
gayly
through
the
clear
and
balmy
night
below
we
find
the
town
in
all
the
animation
of
a
great
holiday
the
streets
are
thronged
the
crowd
passes
by
a
laughing
capricious
slow
unequal
tide
flowing
onwards
however
steadily
in
the
same
direction
towards
the
same
goal
there
arises
therefrom
an
immense
but
light
murmur
in
which
dominate
the
sounds
of
laughter
and
the
interchange
of
polite
speeches
then
follow
lanterns
upon
lanterns
never
in
my
life
have
i
seen
so
many
so
variegated
so
complicated
and
so
extraordinary
we
follow
drifting
with
the
surging
crowd
borne
along
by
it
there
are
groups
of
women
of
every
age
decked
out
in
their
smartest
clothes
crowds
of
mousmés
with
aigrettes
of
flowers
in
their
hair
or
little
silver
like
oyouki
pretty
little
physiognomies
little
narrow
eyes
peeping
between
slit
lids
like
those
of
a
kitten
fat
pale
little
cheeks
round
lips
they
are
pretty
nevertheless
these
little
niponese
in
their
smiles
and
childishness
the
men
on
the
other
hand
wear
many
a
pot
hat
pompously
added
to
the
long
national
robe
and
giving
thereby
a
finishing
touch
to
their
cheerful
ugliness
resembling
nothing
so
much
as
dancing
monkeys
they
carry
boughs
in
their
hands
whole
shrubs
even
amidst
the
foliage
of
which
dangle
all
sorts
of
curious
lanterns
in
the
shape
of
imps
and
birds
as
we
advance
in
the
direction
of
the
temple
the
streets
become
more
noisy
and
crowded
all
along
the
houses
are
endless
stalls
raised
on
trestles
displaying
sweetmeats
of
every
color
toys
branches
of
flowers
nosegays
and
masks
there
are
masks
everywhere
boxes
full
of
them
carts
full
of
them
the
most
popular
being
the
one
that
represents
the
livid
and
cunning
muzzle
contracted
as
by
a
deathlike
grimace
the
long
straight
ears
teeth
of
the
white
fox
sacred
to
the
god
of
rice
there
are
also
others
symbolic
of
gods
or
monsters
livid
grimacing
convulsed
with
wigs
and
beards
of
natural
hair
all
manner
of
folk
even
children
purchase
these
horrors
and
fasten
them
over
their
faces
every
sort
of
instrument
is
for
sale
amongst
them
many
of
those
crystal
trumpets
which
sound
so
strangely
this
evening
they
are
enormous
six
feet
long
at
least
and
the
noise
they
make
is
unlike
anything
ever
heard
before
one
would
say
gigantic
turkeys
gobbling
amongst
the
crowd
and
striving
to
inspire
fear
in
the
religious
amusements
of
this
people
it
is
not
possible
for
us
to
penetrate
the
mysteriously
hidden
meaning
of
things
we
can
not
divine
the
boundary
at
which
jesting
stops
and
mystic
fear
steps
in
these
customs
these
symbols
these
masks
all
that
tradition
and
atavism
have
jumbled
together
in
the
japanese
brain
proceed
from
sources
utterly
dark
and
unknown
to
us
even
the
oldest
records
fail
to
explain
them
to
us
in
anything
but
a
superficial
and
cursory
manner
because
we
have
absolutely
nothing
in
common
with
this
we
pass
in
the
midst
of
their
mirth
and
their
laughter
without
understanding
the
wherefore
so
totally
does
it
differ
from
our
own
chrysanthème
with
yves
oyouki
with
me
fraise
and
zinia
our
cousins
walking
before
us
under
our
watchful
eye
slowly
move
through
the
crowd
holding
each
others
hands
lest
we
should
lose
one
another
all
along
the
streets
leading
to
the
temple
the
wealthy
inhabitants
have
decorated
the
fronts
of
their
houses
with
a
quantity
of
vases
and
nosegays
the
peculiar
buildings
habitual
in
this
country
with
their
open
platform
frontage
are
particularly
well
suited
for
the
display
of
choice
objects
all
the
houses
have
been
thrown
open
and
the
interiors
are
hung
with
draperies
that
hide
the
back
of
the
apartments
in
front
of
these
hangings
and
slightly
standing
back
from
the
movement
of
the
passing
crowd
the
various
exhibited
articles
are
methodically
placed
in
a
row
under
the
full
glare
of
hanging
lamps
hardly
any
flowers
compose
the
nosegays
nothing
but
foliage
some
rare
and
priceless
others
chosen
as
if
purposely
from
amongst
the
commonest
plants
arranged
however
with
such
taste
as
to
make
them
appear
new
and
choice
ordinary
lettuce
leaves
tall
cabbage
stalks
are
placed
with
exquisite
artificial
taste
in
vessels
of
marvelous
workmanship
all
the
vases
are
of
bronze
but
the
designs
are
varied
according
to
each
changing
fancy
some
complicated
and
twisted
others
and
by
far
the
largest
number
graceful
and
simple
but
of
a
simplicity
so
studied
and
exquisite
that
to
our
eyes
they
seem
the
revelation
of
an
unknown
art
the
subversion
of
all
acquired
notions
on
form
on
turning
a
corner
of
a
street
by
good
luck
we
meet
our
married
comrades
of
the
and
jonquille
and
campanule
bows
and
curtsies
are
exchanged
by
the
mousmés
reciprocal
manifestations
of
joy
at
meeting
then
forming
a
compact
band
we
are
carried
off
by
the
crowd
and
continue
our
progress
in
the
direction
of
the
temple
the
streets
gradually
ascend
the
temples
are
always
built
on
a
height
and
by
degrees
as
we
mount
up
there
is
added
to
the
brilliant
fairyland
of
lanterns
and
costumes
yet
another
ethereally
blue
in
the
haze
of
distance
all
nagasaki
its
pagodas
its
mountains
its
still
waters
full
of
the
rays
of
moonlight
seem
to
rise
up
with
us
into
the
air
slowly
step
by
step
one
may
say
it
springs
up
around
enveloping
in
one
great
shimmering
veil
all
the
foreground
with
its
dazzling
red
lights
and
streamers
no
doubt
we
are
getting
near
for
here
are
the
religious
steps
porticos
and
monsters
hewn
out
of
enormous
blocks
of
granite
we
now
have
to
climb
a
series
of
steps
almost
earned
by
the
surging
crowd
ascending
with
us
the
temple
we
have
arrived
this
is
the
last
and
most
astonishing
scene
in
the
a
luminous
and
weird
scene
with
fantastic
distances
lighted
up
by
the
moon
and
the
gigantic
trees
the
sacred
cryptomerias
stretching
forth
their
dark
somber
boughs
like
a
vast
dome
here
we
are
all
seated
with
our
mousmés
beneath
the
light
awning
wreathed
in
flowers
of
one
of
the
many
little
improvised
in
this
courtyard
we
are
on
a
terrace
at
the
top
of
the
great
steps
up
which
the
crowd
continues
to
flock
we
are
at
the
foot
of
a
portico
which
stands
up
erect
with
the
rigid
massiveness
of
a
colossus
against
the
dark
night
sky
at
the
foot
also
of
a
monster
who
stares
down
upon
us
with
his
big
stony
eyes
his
cruel
grimace
and
smile
this
portico
and
the
monster
are
the
two
great
overwhelming
masses
in
the
foreground
of
the
incredible
scene
before
us
they
stand
out
with
dazzling
boldness
against
the
vague
and
ashy
blue
of
the
distant
sphere
beyond
behind
them
nagasaki
is
spread
out
in
a
view
faintly
outlined
in
the
transparent
darkness
with
myriads
of
little
colored
lights
and
the
extravagantly
dented
profile
of
the
mountains
is
delineated
on
the
starlit
sky
blue
upon
blue
transparency
upon
transparency
a
corner
of
the
harbor
is
also
visible
high
up
undefined
like
a
lake
lost
in
the
clouds
the
water
faintly
illumined
by
a
ray
of
moonlight
shining
forth
like
a
sheet
of
silver
around
us
the
long
crystal
trumpets
keep
up
their
gobble
groups
of
polite
and
frivolous
persons
pass
and
repass
like
fantastic
shadows
childish
bands
of
mousmés
with
smile
so
candidly
meaningless
and
chignons
shining
through
their
bright
silver
flowers
ugly
men
waving
at
the
end
of
long
branches
their
eternal
lanterns
shaped
like
birds
gods
or
insects
behind
us
in
the
and
temple
the
bonzes
sit
immovable
embodiments
of
doctrine
in
the
glittering
sanctuary
inhabited
by
divinities
chimeras
and
symbols
the
crowd
monotonously
droning
its
mingled
prayers
and
laughter
presses
around
them
sowing
its
alms
broadcast
with
a
continuous
jingle
the
money
rolls
on
the
ground
into
the
precincts
reserved
to
the
priests
where
the
white
mats
entirely
disappear
under
the
mass
of
coins
accumulated
there
as
after
a
deluge
of
silver
and
bronze
we
however
feel
thoroughly
at
sea
in
the
midst
of
this
festivity
we
look
on
we
laugh
like
the
rest
we
make
foolish
and
senseless
remarks
in
a
language
insufficiently
learned
and
which
this
evening
i
know
not
why
we
can
hardly
understand
notwithstanding
the
night
breeze
we
find
it
very
hot
under
our
awning
and
we
absorb
quantities
of
served
in
cups
which
taste
like
scented
frost
or
rather
like
flowers
steeped
in
snow
our
mousmés
order
for
themselves
great
bowls
of
candied
beans
mixed
with
hail
real
such
as
we
would
pick
up
after
a
in
march
glou
glou
glou
the
crystal
trumpets
slowly
repeat
their
notes
the
powerful
sonority
of
which
has
a
labored
and
smothered
sound
as
though
they
came
from
under
water
they
mingle
with
the
jingling
of
rattles
and
the
noise
of
castanets
we
also
have
the
impression
of
being
carried
away
in
the
irresistible
swing
of
this
incomprehensible
gayety
composed
in
proportions
we
can
scarcely
measure
of
elements
mystic
puerile
and
even
ghastly
a
sort
of
religious
terror
is
diffused
by
the
hidden
idols
divined
in
the
temple
behind
us
by
the
mumbled
prayers
confusedly
heard
above
all
by
the
horrible
heads
in
lacquered
wood
representing
foxes
which
as
they
pass
hide
human
faces
hideous
livid
masks
in
the
gardens
and
outbuildings
of
the
temple
the
most
inconceivable
mountebanks
have
taken
up
their
quarters
their
black
streamers
painted
with
white
letters
looking
like
funereal
trappings
as
they
float
in
the
wind
from
the
top
of
their
tall
flagstaffs
hither
we
turn
out
steps
as
soon
as
our
mousmés
have
ended
their
orisons
and
bestowed
their
alms
in
one
of
the
booths
a
man
stretched
on
a
table
flat
on
his
back
is
alone
on
the
stage
puppets
of
almost
human
size
with
horribly
grinning
masks
spring
out
of
his
body
they
speak
gesticulate
then
fall
back
like
empty
rags
with
a
sudden
spring
they
start
up
again
change
their
costumes
change
their
faces
tearing
about
in
one
continual
frenzy
suddenly
three
even
four
appear
at
the
same
time
they
are
nothing
more
than
the
four
limbs
of
the
outstretched
man
whose
legs
and
arms
raised
on
high
are
each
one
dressed
up
and
capped
with
a
wig
under
which
peers
a
mask
between
these
phantoms
tremendous
fighting
and
battling
take
place
and
many
a
is
exchanged
the
most
fearful
of
all
is
a
certain
puppet
representing
an
hag
every
time
she
appears
with
her
weird
head
and
ghastly
grin
the
lights
burn
low
the
music
of
the
accompanying
orchestra
moans
forth
a
sinister
strain
given
by
the
flutes
mingled
with
a
rattling
tremolo
which
sounds
like
the
clatter
of
bones
this
creature
evidently
plays
an
ugly
part
in
the
piece
that
of
a
horrible
old
ghoul
spiteful
and
famished
still
more
appalling
than
her
person
is
her
shadow
which
projected
upon
a
white
screen
is
abnormally
and
vividly
distinct
by
means
of
some
unknown
process
this
shadow
which
nevertheless
follows
all
her
movements
assumes
the
aspect
of
a
wolf
at
a
given
moment
the
hag
turns
round
and
presents
the
profile
of
her
distorted
snub
nose
as
she
accepts
the
bowl
of
rice
which
is
offered
to
her
on
the
screen
at
the
very
same
instant
appears
the
elongated
outline
of
the
wolf
with
its
pointed
ears
its
muzzle
and
chops
its
great
teeth
and
hanging
tongue
the
orchestra
grinds
wails
quivers
then
suddenly
bursts
out
into
funereal
shrieks
like
a
concert
of
owls
the
hag
is
now
eating
and
her
wolfish
shadow
is
eating
also
greedily
moving
its
jaws
and
nibbling
at
another
shadow
easy
to
recognize
the
arm
of
a
little
child
we
now
go
on
to
see
the
of
japan
an
animal
rare
in
this
country
and
quite
unknown
elsewhere
a
great
cold
mass
sluggish
and
benumbed
looking
like
some
antediluvian
forgotten
in
the
inner
seas
of
this
archipelago
next
comes
the
trained
elephant
the
terror
of
our
mousmés
the
equilibrists
the
menagerie
it
is
one
in
the
morning
before
we
are
back
at
we
first
get
yves
to
bed
in
the
little
paper
room
he
has
already
once
occupied
then
we
go
to
bed
ourselves
after
the
inevitable
preparations
the
smoking
of
the
little
pipe
and
the
pan
pan
pan
on
the
edge
of
the
box
suddenly
yves
begins
to
move
restlessly
in
his
sleep
to
toss
about
giving
great
kicks
on
the
wall
and
making
a
frightful
noise
what
can
be
the
matter
i
at
once
imagine
that
he
must
be
dreaming
of
the
old
hag
and
her
wolfish
shadow
chrysanthème
raises
herself
on
her
elbow
and
listens
with
astonishment
depicted
on
her
face
ah
happy
thought
she
has
discovered
what
is
tormenting
him
ka
mosquitoes
she
says
and
to
impress
the
more
forcibly
her
meaning
on
my
mind
she
pinches
my
arm
so
hard
with
her
little
pointed
nails
at
the
same
time
imitating
with
such
an
amusing
play
of
her
features
the
grimace
of
a
person
who
is
stung
that
i
exclaim
oh
stop
chrysanthème
this
pantomime
is
too
expressive
and
indeed
useless
i
know
the
word
and
had
quite
understood
i
assure
you
it
is
done
so
drolly
and
so
quickly
with
such
a
pretty
pout
that
in
truth
i
can
not
think
of
being
angry
although
i
shall
certainly
have
a
blue
mark
on
my
arm
about
that
there
is
no
doubt
come
we
must
get
up
and
go
to
yves
rescue
he
can
not
be
allowed
to
go
on
thumping
in
that
manner
let
us
take
a
lantern
and
see
what
has
happened
it
was
indeed
the
mosquitoes
they
are
hovering
in
a
thick
cloud
about
him
those
of
the
house
and
those
of
the
garden
all
seem
collected
together
swarming
and
buzzing
chrysanthème
indignantly
burns
several
at
the
flame
of
her
lantern
and
shows
me
others
hou
covering
the
white
paper
walls
he
tired
out
with
his
day
amusement
sleeps
on
but
his
slumbers
are
restless
as
can
be
easily
imagined
chrysanthème
gives
him
a
shake
wishing
him
to
get
up
and
share
our
blue
mosquito
net
after
a
little
pressing
he
does
as
he
is
bid
and
follows
us
looking
like
an
overgrown
boy
only
half
awake
i
make
no
objection
to
this
singular
hospitality
after
all
it
looks
so
little
like
a
bed
the
matting
we
are
to
share
and
we
sleep
in
our
clothes
as
we
always
do
according
to
the
niponese
fashion
after
all
on
a
journey
in
a
railway
do
not
the
most
estimable
ladies
stretch
themselves
without
demur
by
the
side
of
gentlemen
unknown
to
them
i
have
however
placed
chrysanthème
little
wooden
block
in
the
center
of
the
gauze
tent
between
our
two
pillows
then
without
saying
a
word
in
a
dignified
manner
as
though
she
were
rectifying
an
error
of
etiquette
that
i
had
inadvertently
committed
chrysanthème
takes
up
her
piece
of
wood
putting
in
its
place
my
drum
i
shall
therefore
be
in
the
middle
between
the
two
it
is
really
more
correct
decidedly
much
more
proper
chrysanthème
is
evidently
a
very
decorous
young
person
returning
on
board
next
morning
in
the
clear
morning
sun
we
walk
through
pathways
full
of
dew
accompanied
by
a
band
of
funny
little
mousmés
of
six
or
eight
years
of
age
who
are
going
off
to
school
needless
to
say
that
the
cicalas
around
us
keep
up
their
perpetual
sonorous
chirping
the
mountain
smells
delicious
the
atmosphere
the
dawning
day
the
infantine
grace
of
these
little
girls
in
their
long
frocks
and
shiny
chignons
all
is
redundant
with
freshness
and
youth
the
flowers
and
grasses
on
which
we
tread
sparkle
with
dewdrops
exhaling
a
perfume
of
freshness
what
undying
beauty
there
is
even
in
japan
in
the
first
fresh
morning
hours
in
the
country
and
the
dawning
hours
of
life
besides
i
am
quite
ready
to
admit
the
attractiveness
of
the
little
japanese
children
some
of
them
are
most
fascinating
but
how
is
it
that
their
charm
vanishes
so
rapidly
and
is
so
quickly
replaced
by
the
elderly
grimace
the
smiling
ugliness
the
monkeyish
face
xxxv
my
madame
renoncule
small
garden
is
without
exception
one
of
the
most
melancholy
spots
i
have
seen
during
all
my
peregrinations
through
the
world
oh
the
slow
enervating
dull
hours
spent
in
idle
and
diffuse
conversation
in
the
dimly
lighted
verandah
oh
the
horrid
peppered
jam
in
the
microscopic
pots
in
the
middle
of
the
town
enclosed
by
four
walls
is
this
park
of
five
yards
square
with
little
lakes
little
mountains
and
little
rocks
where
all
wears
an
antiquated
appearance
and
everything
is
covered
with
a
greenish
moldiness
from
want
of
sun
nevertheless
a
true
feeling
for
nature
has
inspired
this
tiny
representation
of
a
wild
spot
the
rocks
are
well
placed
the
dwarf
cedars
no
taller
than
cabbages
stretch
their
gnarled
boughs
over
the
valleys
in
the
attitude
of
giants
wearied
by
the
weight
of
centuries
and
their
look
of
perplexes
one
and
falsifies
the
perspective
when
from
the
dark
recesses
of
the
apartment
one
perceives
at
a
certain
distance
this
diminutive
landscape
dimly
lighted
up
the
wonder
is
whether
it
is
all
artificial
or
whether
one
is
not
oneself
the
victim
of
some
morbid
illusion
and
if
it
is
not
indeed
a
real
country
view
seen
through
a
distorted
vision
out
of
focus
or
through
the
wrong
end
of
a
telescope
to
any
one
familiar
with
japanese
life
my
house
in
itself
reveals
a
refined
nature
complete
nudity
two
or
three
screens
placed
here
and
there
a
teapot
a
vase
full
of
and
nothing
more
woodwork
devoid
of
paint
or
varnish
but
carved
in
most
elaborate
and
capricious
openwork
the
whiteness
of
the
pinewood
being
kept
up
by
constant
scrubbings
of
soap
and
water
the
posts
and
beams
of
the
framework
are
varied
by
the
most
fanciful
taste
some
are
cut
in
precise
geometrical
forms
others
artificially
twisted
imitating
trunks
of
old
trees
covered
with
tropical
creepers
everywhere
little
little
nooks
little
closets
concealed
in
the
most
ingenious
and
unexpected
manner
under
the
immaculate
uniformity
of
the
white
paper
panels
i
can
not
help
smiling
when
i
think
of
some
of
the
overcrowded
with
and
curios
and
hung
with
coarse
gold
embroideries
on
exported
satins
of
our
parisian
fine
ladies
i
would
advise
those
persons
to
come
and
look
at
the
houses
of
people
of
taste
out
here
to
visit
the
white
solitudes
of
the
palaces
at
yeddo
in
france
we
have
works
of
art
in
order
to
enjoy
them
here
they
possess
them
merely
to
ticket
them
and
lock
them
up
carefully
in
a
kind
of
mysterious
underground
room
shut
in
by
iron
gratings
called
a
on
rare
occasions
only
to
honor
some
visitor
of
distinction
do
they
open
this
impenetrable
depositary
the
true
japanese
manner
of
understanding
luxury
consists
in
a
scrupulous
and
indeed
almost
excessive
cleanliness
white
mats
and
white
woodwork
an
appearance
of
extreme
simplicity
and
an
incredible
nicety
in
the
most
infinitesimal
details
my
seems
to
be
really
a
very
nice
woman
and
were
it
not
for
the
insurmountable
feeling
of
spleen
the
sight
of
her
garden
produces
on
me
i
would
often
go
and
see
her
she
has
nothing
in
common
with
the
mammas
of
jonquille
campanule
or
touki
she
is
vastly
their
superior
and
then
i
can
see
that
she
has
been
very
and
stylish
her
past
life
puzzles
me
but
in
my
position
as
a
good
manners
prevent
my
making
further
inquiries
some
assert
that
she
was
formerly
a
celebrated
guécha
in
yeddo
who
lost
public
favor
by
her
folly
in
becoming
a
mother
this
would
account
for
her
daughter
talent
on
the
guitar
she
had
probably
herself
taught
her
the
touch
and
style
of
the
conservatory
since
the
birth
of
chrysanthème
her
eldest
child
and
first
cause
of
this
loss
of
favor
my
an
expansive
although
distinguished
nature
has
fallen
seven
times
into
the
same
fatal
error
and
i
have
two
little
mdlle

well
as

the
most
xxxvi
august
we
have
spent
the
day
yves
chrysanthème
oyouki
and
myself
wandering
through
dark
and
dusty
nooks
dragged
hither
and
thither
by
four
djins
in
search
of
antiquities
in
the
shops
towards
sunset
chrysanthème
who
has
wearied
me
more
than
ever
since
the
morning
and
who
doubtless
has
perceived
it
pulls
a
very
long
face
declares
herself
ill
and
begs
leave
to
spend
the
night
at
her
mother
madame
renoncule
i
agree
to
this
with
the
best
grace
in
the
world
let
her
go
tiresome
little
mousmé
oyouki
will
carry
a
message
to
her
parents
who
will
shut
up
our
rooms
we
shall
spend
the
evening
yves
and
i
in
roaming
about
as
fancy
takes
us
without
any
mousmé
dragging
at
our
heels
and
shall
afterwards
regain
our
own
quarters
on
board
the
without
having
the
trouble
of
climbing
up
that
hill
first
of
all
we
make
an
attempt
to
dine
together
in
some
fashionable
impossible
there
is
not
a
place
to
be
had
all
the
absurd
paper
rooms
all
the
compartments
contrived
by
so
many
ingenious
dodges
of
slipping
and
sliding
panels
all
the
nooks
and
corners
in
the
little
gardens
are
filled
with
japanese
men
and
women
eating
impossible
and
incredible
little
dishes
numberless
young
dandies
are
dining
with
the
lady
of
their
choice
and
sounds
of
dancing
girls
and
music
issue
from
the
private
rooms
the
fact
is
that
is
the
third
and
last
day
of
the
great
pilgrimage
to
the
temple
of
the
of
which
we
saw
the
commencement
yesterday
and
all
nagasaki
is
at
this
time
given
over
to
amusement
at
the
of
the
which
is
also
full
to
overflowing
but
where
we
are
they
have
had
the
bright
idea
of
throwing
a
temporary
flooring
over
the
little
lake
the
pond
where
the
live
and
it
is
here
that
our
meal
is
served
in
the
pleasant
freshness
of
the
fountain
which
continues
its
murmur
under
our
feet
after
dinner
we
follow
the
faithful
and
ascend
again
to
the
temple
up
there
we
find
the
same
elfin
revelry
the
same
masks
the
same
music
we
seat
ourselves
as
before
under
a
gauze
tent
and
sip
odd
little
drinks
tasting
of
flowers
but
this
evening
we
are
alone
and
the
absence
of
the
band
of
mousmés
whose
familiar
little
faces
formed
a
bond
of
union
between
this
people
and
ourselves
separates
and
isolates
us
more
than
usual
from
the
profusion
of
oddities
in
the
midst
of
which
we
seem
to
be
lost
beneath
us
lies
always
the
immense
blue
background
nagasaki
illumined
by
moonlight
and
the
expanse
of
silvered
glittering
water
which
seems
like
a
vaporous
vision
suspended
in
behind
us
is
the
great
open
temple
where
the
bonzes
officiate
to
the
accompaniment
of
sacred
bells
and
wooden
clappers
looking
from
where
we
sit
more
like
puppets
than
anything
else
some
squatting
in
rows
like
peaceful
mummies
others
executing
rhythmical
marches
before
the
golden
background
where
stand
the
gods
we
do
not
laugh
and
speak
but
little
more
forcibly
struck
by
the
scene
than
we
were
on
the
first
night
we
only
look
on
trying
to
understand
suddenly
yves
turning
round
says
hullo
brother
your
mousmé
actually
there
she
is
behind
him
chrysanthème
almost
on
all
fours
hidden
between
the
paws
of
a
great
granite
beast
half
tiger
half
dog
against
which
our
fragile
tent
is
leaning
she
pulled
my
trousers
with
her
nails
for
all
the
world
like
a
little
cat
said
yves
still
full
of
surprise
positively
like
a
cat
she
remains
bent
double
in
the
most
humble
form
of
salutation
she
smiles
timidly
afraid
of
being
ill
received
and
the
head
of
my
little
bambou
appears
smiling
too
just
above
her
own
she
has
brought
this
little
i
with
her
perched
astride
on
her
back
he
looks
as
absurd
as
ever
with
his
shaven
head
his
long
frock
and
the
great
bows
of
his
silken
sash
there
they
both
stand
gazing
at
us
anxious
to
know
how
their
joke
will
be
taken
footnote
i
is
the
masculine
of
and
signifies
little
boy
excessive
politeness
makes
it
little
boy
for
my
part
i
have
not
the
least
idea
of
giving
them
a
cold
reception
on
the
contrary
the
meeting
amuses
me
it
even
strikes
me
that
it
is
rather
pretty
of
chrysanthème
to
come
round
in
this
way
and
to
bring
to
the
festival
though
it
savors
somewhat
of
her
low
breeding
to
tell
the
truth
to
have
tacked
him
on
to
her
back
as
the
poorer
japanese
women
do
with
their
little
ones
however
let
her
sit
down
between
yves
and
myself
and
let
them
bring
her
those
iced
beans
she
loves
so
much
and
we
will
take
the
jolly
little
on
our
knees
and
cram
him
with
sugar
and
sweetness
to
his
heart
content
the
evening
over
when
we
begin
to
think
of
leaving
and
of
going
down
again
chrysanthème
replaces
her
little
bambou
astride
upon
her
back
and
sets
forth
bending
forward
under
his
weight
and
painfully
dragging
her
cinderella
slippers
over
the
granite
steps
and
flagstones
yes
decidedly
low
this
conduct
but
low
in
the
best
sense
of
the
word
nothing
in
it
displeases
me
i
even
consider
chrysanthème
affection
for
engaging
and
attractive
in
its
simplicity
one
can
not
deny
this
merit
to
the
japanese
a
great
love
for
little
children
and
a
talent
for
amusing
them
for
making
them
laugh
inventing
comical
toys
for
them
making
the
morning
of
their
life
happy
for
a
specialty
in
dressing
them
arranging
their
heads
and
giving
to
the
whole
little
personage
the
most
diverting
appearance
possible
it
is
the
only
thing
i
really
like
about
this
country
the
babies
and
the
manner
in
which
they
are
understood
on
our
way
we
meet
our
married
friends
of
the
who
much
surprised
at
seeing
me
with
this
chaffingly
exclaim
what
a
son
already
down
in
the
town
we
make
a
point
of
bidding
to
chrysanthème
at
the
turning
of
the
street
where
her
mother
lives
she
smiles
undecided
declares
herself
well
again
and
begs
to
return
to
our
house
on
the
heights
this
did
not
precisely
enter
into
my
plans
i
confess
however
it
would
look
very
ungracious
to
refuse
so
be
it
but
we
must
carry
the
home
to
his
mamma
and
then
begin
by
the
flickering
light
of
a
new
lantern
bought
afresh
from
madame
our
weary
homeward
ascent
here
however
we
find
ourselves
in
another
predicament
this
ridiculous
little
bambou
insists
upon
coming
with
us
no
he
will
take
no
denial
we
must
take
him
with
us
this
is
out
of
all
reason
quite
impossible
however
it
will
not
do
to
make
him
cry
on
the
night
of
a
great
festival
too
poor
little
so
we
must
send
a
message
to
madame
renoncule
that
she
may
not
be
uneasy
about
him
and
as
there
will
soon
not
be
a
living
creature
on
the
footpaths
of
to
laugh
at
us
we
will
take
it
in
turn
yves
and
i
to
carry
him
on
our
back
all
the
way
up
that
climb
in
the
darkness
and
here
am
i
who
did
not
wish
to
return
this
way
dragging
a
mousmé
by
the
hand
actually
carrying
an
extra
burden
in
the
shape
of
a
on
my
back
what
an
irony
of
fate
as
i
had
expected
all
our
shutters
and
doors
are
closed
bolted
and
barred
no
one
expects
us
and
we
have
to
make
a
prodigious
noise
at
the
door
chrysanthème
sets
to
work
and
calls
with
all
her
might
ho
in
english
hi
madame
these
intonations
in
her
little
voice
are
unknown
to
me
her
longdrawn
call
in
the
echoing
darkness
of
midnight
has
so
strange
an
accent
something
so
unexpected
and
wild
that
it
impresses
me
with
a
dismal
feeling
of
exile
at
last
madame
prune
appears
to
open
the
door
to
us
only
half
awake
and
much
astonished
by
way
of
a
she
wears
a
monstrous
cotton
turban
on
the
blue
ground
of
which
a
few
white
storks
are
playfully
disporting
themselves
holding
in
the
tips
of
her
fingers
with
an
affectation
of
graceful
fright
the
long
stalk
of
her
beflowered
lantern
she
gazes
intently
into
our
faces
one
after
another
to
assure
herself
of
our
identity
but
the
poor
old
lady
can
not
get
over
the
i
am
carrying
xxxvii
at
first
it
was
only
to
chrysanthème
guitar
that
i
listened
with
pleasure
now
i
am
beginning
to
like
her
singing
also
she
has
nothing
of
the
theatrical
or
the
deep
assumed
voice
of
the
virtuoso
on
the
contrary
her
notes
always
very
high
are
soft
thin
and
plaintive
she
will
often
teach
oyouki
some
romance
slow
and
dreamy
which
she
has
composed
or
which
comes
back
to
her
mind
then
they
both
astonish
me
for
on
their
guitars
they
will
search
out
accompaniments
in
parts
and
try
again
each
time
that
the
chords
are
not
perfectly
true
to
their
ear
without
ever
losing
themselves
in
the
confusion
of
these
dissonant
harmonies
always
weird
and
always
melancholy
generally
while
their
music
is
going
on
i
am
writing
in
the
verandah
with
the
superb
stretched
out
in
front
of
me
i
write
seated
on
a
mat
on
the
floor
and
leaning
upon
a
little
japanese
desk
ornamented
with
swallows
in
relief
my
ink
is
chinese
my
just
like
that
of
my
landlord
is
in
jade
with
dear
little
frogs
and
toads
carved
on
the
rim
in
short
i
am
writing
my
memoirs
exactly
as
sucre
does
downstairs
occasionally
i
fancy
i
resemble
him
a
very
disagreeable
fancy
my
memoirs
composed
of
incongruous
details
minute
observations
of
colors
shapes
scents
and
sounds
it
is
true
that
a
complete
imbroglio
worthy
of
a
romance
seems
ever
threatening
to
appear
upon
my
monotonous
horizon
a
regular
intrigue
seems
ever
ready
to
explode
in
the
midst
of
this
little
world
of
mousmés
and
grasshoppers
chrysanthème
in
love
with
yves
yves
with
chrysanthème
oyouki
with
me
i
with
no
one
we
might
even
find
here
ready
to
hand
the
elements
of
a
fratricidal
drama
were
we
in
any
other
country
than
japan
but
we
are
in
japan
and
under
the
narrowing
and
dwarfing
influence
of
the
surroundings
which
turn
everything
into
ridicule
nothing
will
come

xxxviii
there
is
in
this
good
town
of
nagasaki
towards
five
or
six
in
the
evening
one
hour
of
the
day
more
comical
than
any
other
at
this
moment
every
living
being
is
naked
children
young
people
old
people
old
men
old
women
every
one
is
seated
in
a
tub
of
some
sort
taking
a
bath
this
takes
place
no
matter
where
without
the
slightest
screen
in
the
gardens
the
courtyards
in
the
shops
even
upon
the
thresholds
in
order
to
give
greater
facility
for
conversation
among
the
neighbors
from
one
side
of
the
street
to
the
other
in
this
situation
visitors
are
received
and
the
bather
without
any
hesitation
leaves
his
tub
holding
in
his
hand
his
little
towel
invariably
blue
to
offer
the
caller
a
seat
and
to
exchange
with
him
some
amiable
remarks
nevertheless
neither
the
mousmés
nor
the
old
ladies
gain
anything
by
appearing
in
this
primeval
costume
a
japanese
woman
deprived
of
her
long
dress
and
her
huge
sash
with
its
pretentious
bows
is
nothing
but
a
diminutive
yellow
being
with
crooked
legs
and
flat
unshapely
bust
she
has
no
longer
a
remnant
of
her
artificial
little
charms
which
have
completely
disappeared
in
company
with
her
costume
there
is
yet
another
hour
at
once
joyous
and
melancholy
a
little
later
when
twilight
falls
when
the
sky
seems
one
vast
veil
of
yellow
against
which
stand
the
outlines
of
jagged
mountains
and
lofty
fantastic
pagodas
it
is
the
hour
at
which
in
the
labyrinth
of
little
gray
streets
down
below
the
sacred
lamps
begin
to
twinkle
in
the
houses
in
front
of
the
ancestors
altars
and
the
familiar
buddhas
while
outside
darkness
creeps
over
all
and
the
thousand
and
one
indentations
and
peaks
of
the
old
roofs
are
depicted
as
if
in
black
festoons
on
the
clear
golden
sky
at
this
moment
there
suddenly
passes
over
merry
laughing
japan
a
somber
shadow
strange
weird
a
breath
of
antiquity
of
savagery
of
something
indefinable
which
casts
a
gloom
of
sadness
and
then
the
only
gayety
that
remains
is
the
gayety
of
the
population
of
young
children
of
little
mouskos
and
little
mousmés
who
spread
themselves
like
a
wave
through
the
streets
filled
with
shadow
as
they
swarm
out
from
schools
and
workshops
on
the
dark
background
of
all
these
wooden
buildings
the
little
blue
and
scarlet
dresses
stand
out
in
startling
contrast
drolly
bedizened
drolly
draped
and
the
fine
loops
of
the
sashes
the
flowers
the
silver
or
gold
stuck
in
these
baby
chignons
add
to
the
vivid
effect
they
amuse
themselves
they
chase
each
other
their
great
pagoda
sleeves
fly
widely
open
and
these
tiny
little
mousmés
of
ten
of
five
years
old
or
even
younger
still
have
lofty
and
imposing
bows
of
hair
arranged
on
their
little
heads
like
women
oh
what
loves
of
supremely
absurd
dolls
at
this
hour
of
twilight
gambol
through
the
streets
in
their
long
frocks
blowing
their
crystal
trumpets
or
running
with
all
their
might
to
start
their
fanciful
kites
this
juvenile
world
of
japan
ludicrous
by
birth
and
fated
to
become
more
so
as
the
years
roll
on
starts
in
life
with
singular
amusements
with
strange
cries
and
shouts
its
playthings
are
somewhat
ghastly
and
would
frighten
the
children
of
other
countries
even
the
kites
have
great
squinting
eyes
and
vampire
shapes
and
every
evening
in
the
little
dark
streets
bursts
forth
this
overflow
of
joyousness
fresh
childish
but
withal
grotesque
to
excess
it
would
be
difficult
to
have
any
idea
of
the
incredible
things
which
carried
by
the
wind
float
in
the
evening
air
xxxix
little
chrysanthème
is
always
arrayed
in
dark
colors
a
sign
here
of
aristocratic
distinction
while
her
friends
madame
touki
and
others
delight
in
stuffs
and
stick
gorgeous
ornaments
in
their
chignons
she
always
wears
or
neutral
gray
fastened
round
her
waist
with
great
black
sashes
brocaded
in
tender
shades
and
puts
nothing
in
her
hair
but
pins
if
she
were
of
noble
descent
she
would
wear
embroidered
on
her
dress
in
the
middle
of
the
back
a
little
white
circle
looking
like
a
postmark
with
some
design
in
the
center
of
it
the
leaf
of
a
tree
generally
and
this
would
be
her
coat
of
arms
there
is
really
nothing
wanting
but
this
little
heraldic
blazon
on
the
back
to
give
her
the
appearance
of
a
lady
of
the
highest
position
in
japan
the
smart
dresses
of
bright
colors
shaded
in
clouds
embroidered
with
monsters
of
gold
or
silver
are
reserved
by
the
great
ladies
for
home
use
on
state
occasions
or
else
they
are
used
on
the
stage
for
the
dancers
and
the
courtesans
like
all
japanese
women
chrysanthème
carries
a
quantity
of
things
in
her
long
sleeves
in
which
pockets
are
cunningly
hidden
there
she
keeps
letters
various
notes
written
on
delicate
sheets
of
prayer
amulets
drawn
up
by
the
bonzes
and
above
all
a
number
of
squares
of
a
silky
paper
which
she
puts
to
the
most
unexpected
uses
to
dry
a
to
hold
the
damp
stalk
of
a
flower
or
to
blow
her
quaint
little
nose
when
the
necessity
presents
itself
after
the
operation
she
at
once
crumples
up
the
piece
of
paper
rolls
it
into
a
ball
and
throws
it
out
of
the
window
with
disgust
the
very
smartest
people
in
japan
blow
their
noses
in
this
manner
xl
chance
has
favored
us
with
a
friendship
as
singular
as
it
is
rare
that
of
the
head
bonzes
of
the
temple
of
the
where
we
had
witnessed
last
month
such
a
surprising
pilgrimage
the
approach
to
this
place
is
as
solitary
now
as
it
was
thronged
and
bustling
on
the
evenings
of
the
festival
and
in
broad
daylight
one
is
surprised
at
the
deathlike
decay
of
the
religious
surroundings
which
at
night
had
seemed
so
full
of
life
not
a
creature
to
be
seen
on
the
granite
steps
not
a
creature
beneath
the
vast
sumptuous
porticoes
the
colors
the
are
dim
with
dust
to
reach
the
temple
one
must
cross
several
deserted
courtyards
terraced
on
the
mountain
side
pass
through
several
solemn
gateways
and
up
and
up
endless
stairs
rising
far
above
the
town
and
the
noises
of
humanity
into
a
sacred
region
filled
with
innumerable
tombs
on
all
the
pavements
in
all
the
walls
lichen
and
stonecrop
and
over
all
the
gray
tint
of
extreme
age
spreads
everywhere
like
a
fall
of
ashes
in
a
side
temple
near
the
entrance
is
enthroned
a
colossal
buddha
seated
in
his
lotus
a
gilded
idol
some
or
sixty
feet
high
mounted
on
an
enormous
pedestal
of
bronze
at
length
appears
the
last
doorway
with
the
two
traditional
giants
guardians
of
the
sacred
court
which
stand
the
one
on
the
right
hand
the
other
on
the
left
shut
up
like
wild
beasts
each
one
in
a
cage
of
iron
they
are
in
attitudes
of
fury
with
fists
upraised
as
if
to
strike
and
features
atrociously
fierce
and
distorted
their
bodies
are
covered
all
over
with
bullets
of
crumbled
paper
which
have
been
aimed
at
them
through
the
bars
and
which
have
stuck
to
their
monstrous
limbs
like
a
white
leprosy
this
is
the
manner
in
which
the
faithful
strive
to
appease
them
by
conveying
to
them
their
prayers
written
upon
delicate
leaflets
by
the
pious
bonzes
passing
between
these
alarming
scarecrows
one
reaches
the
innermost
court
the
residence
of
our
friends
is
on
the
right
the
great
hall
of
the
pagoda
is
before
us
in
this
paved
court
are
bronze
as
high
as
turrets
here
too
stand
and
have
stood
for
centuries
cyca
palms
with
fresh
green
plumes
their
numerous
stalks
curving
with
a
heavy
symmetry
like
the
branches
of
massive
candelabra
the
temple
which
is
open
along
its
entire
length
is
dark
and
mysterious
with
touches
of
gilding
in
distant
corners
melting
away
into
the
gloom
in
the
very
remotest
part
are
seated
idols
and
from
outside
one
can
vaguely
see
their
clasped
hands
and
air
of
rapt
mysticism
in
front
are
the
altars
loaded
with
marvelous
vases
in
whence
spring
graceful
clusters
of
gold
and
silver
lotus
from
the
very
entrance
one
is
greeted
by
the
sweet
odor
of
the
unceasingly
burnt
by
the
priests
before
the
gods
to
penetrate
into
the
dwelling
of
our
friends
the
bonzes
which
is
situated
on
the
right
hand
side
as
you
enter
is
by
no
means
an
easy
matter
a
monster
of
the
fish
tribe
but
having
claws
and
horns
is
hung
over
their
door
by
iron
chains
at
the
least
breath
of
wind
he
swings
creakingly
we
pass
beneath
him
and
enter
the
first
immense
and
lofty
hall
dimly
lighted
in
the
corners
of
which
gleam
gilded
idols
bells
and
incomprehensible
objects
of
religious
use
quaint
little
creatures
choir
boys
or
pupils
come
forward
with
a
doubtful
welcome
to
ask
what
is
wanted
they
repeat
much
astonished
when
they
understand
to
whom
we
wish
to
be
conducted
oh
no
impossible
they
can
not
be
seen
they
are
resting
or
are
in
contemplation
orimas
say
they
clasping
their
hands
and
sketching
a
genuflection
or
two
to
make
us
understand
better
they
are
at
prayer
the
most
profound
prayer
we
insist
speak
more
imperatively
even
slip
off
our
shoes
like
people
determined
to
take
no
refusal
at
last
and
make
their
appearance
from
the
tranquil
depths
of
their
they
are
dressed
in
black
crape
and
their
heads
are
shaved
smiling
amiable
full
of
excuses
they
offer
us
their
hands
and
we
follow
with
our
feet
bare
like
theirs
to
the
interior
of
their
mysterious
dwelling
through
a
series
of
empty
rooms
spread
with
mats
of
the
most
unimpeachable
whiteness
the
successive
halls
are
separated
one
from
the
other
only
by
bamboo
curtains
of
exquisite
delicacy
caught
back
by
tassels
and
cords
of
red
silk
the
whole
wainscoting
of
the
interior
is
of
the
same
wood
of
a
pale
yellow
color
joinered
with
extreme
nicety
without
the
least
ornament
the
least
carving
everything
seems
new
and
unused
as
though
it
had
never
been
touched
by
human
hand
at
distant
intervals
in
this
studied
bareness
costly
little
stools
marvelously
inlaid
uphold
some
antique
bronze
monster
or
a
vase
of
flowers
on
the
walls
hang
a
few
masterly
sketches
vaguely
tinted
in
indian
ink
drawn
upon
strips
of
gray
paper
most
accurately
cut
but
without
the
slightest
attempt
at
a
frame
this
is
all
not
a
seat
not
a
cushion
not
a
scrap
of
furniture
it
is
the
very
acme
of
studied
simplicity
of
elegance
made
out
of
nothing
of
the
most
immaculate
and
incredible
cleanliness
and
while
following
the
bonzes
through
this
long
suite
of
empty
halls
we
are
struck
by
their
contrast
with
the
overflow
of
scattered
about
our
rooms
in
france
and
we
take
a
sudden
dislike
to
the
profusion
and
crowding
delighted
in
at
home
the
spot
where
this
silent
march
of
barefooted
folk
comes
to
an
end
the
spot
where
we
are
to
seat
ourselves
in
the
delightful
coolness
of
a
is
an
interior
verandah
opening
upon
an
artificial
site
we
might
suppose
it
were
the
bottom
of
a
well
it
is
a
miniature
garden
no
bigger
than
the
opening
of
an
overhung
on
all
sides
by
the
crushing
height
of
the
mountain
and
receiving
from
on
high
but
the
dim
light
of
nevertheless
here
is
simulated
a
great
natural
ravine
in
all
its
wild
grandeur
here
are
caverns
abrupt
rocks
a
torrent
a
cascade
islands
the
trees
dwarfed
by
a
japanese
process
of
which
we
have
not
the
secret
have
tiny
little
leaves
on
their
decrepit
and
knotty
branches
a
pervading
hue
of
the
mossy
green
of
antiquity
harmonizes
all
this
medley
which
is
undoubtedly
centuries
old
families
of
swim
round
and
round
in
the
clear
water
and
tiny
tortoises
probably
sleep
upon
the
granite
islands
which
are
of
the
same
color
as
their
own
gray
shell
there
are
even
blue
which
have
ventured
to
descend
heaven
knows
from
whence
and
alight
with
quivering
wings
upon
the
miniature
our
friends
the
bonzes
notwithstanding
an
unctuousness
of
manner
thoroughly
ecclesiastical
are
very
ready
to
laugh
a
simple
pleased
childish
laughter
plump
chubby
shaven
and
shorn
they
dearly
love
our
french
liqueurs
and
know
how
to
take
a
joke
we
talk
first
of
one
thing
and
then
another
to
the
tranquil
music
of
their
little
cascade
i
launch
out
before
them
with
phrases
of
the
most
erudite
japanese
i
try
the
effect
of
a
few
tenses
of
verbs
concessives
hypothetics
in
whilst

the

with

seals
for

trace
little
prayers
with
a
cunning
as
medical
remedies
to
be
swallowed
as
pills
by
invalids
at
a
distance
with
their
white
and
dimpled
hands
they
play
with
a
fan
as
cleverly
as
any
woman
and
when
we
have
tasted
different
native
drinks
flavored
with
essences
of

they

up

a

or

the
liqueurs
composed
by
their
western
colleagues
when
they
come
on
board
to
return
our
visits
they
by
no
means
disdain
to
fasten
their
great
round
spectacles
on
their
flat
noses
in
order
to
inspect
the
profane
drawings
in
our
illustrated
papers
the
for
instance
and
it
is
even
with
a
certain
complacency
that
they
let
their
fingers
linger
upon
the
pictures
which
represent
the
ladies
the
religious
ceremonies
in
their
great
temple
are
magnificent
and
to
one
of
these
we
are
now
invited
at
the
sound
of
the
gong
they
make
their
entrance
before
the
idols
with
a
stately
ritual
twenty
or
thirty
priests
officiate
in
gala
costumes
with
genuflections
clapping
of
hands
and
movements
to
and
fro
which
look
like
the
figures
of
some
mystic
quadrille
but
for
all
that
let
the
sanctuary
be
ever
so
immense
and
imposing
in
its
somber
gloom
the
idols
ever
so
superb
all
seems
in
japan
but
a
mere
semblance
of
grandeur
a
hopeless
pettiness
an
irresistible
feeling
of
the
ludicrous
lies
at
the
bottom
of
all
things
and
then
the
congregation
is
not
conducive
to
thoughtful
contemplation
for
among
it
we
generally
discover
some
acquaintance
my
or
a
cousin
or
the
woman
from
the
who
sold
us
a
vase
only
yesterday
charming
little
mousmés
old
ladies
enter
with
their
their
parasols
their
curtsies
their
little
cries
and
exclamations
prattling
complimenting
each
other
full
of
restless
movement
and
having
the
greatest
difficulty
in
maintaining
a
serious
demeanor
xli
chrysanthème
for
the
first
time
paid
me
a
visit
on
board
ship
chaperoned
by
madame
prune
and
followed
by
my
youngest
mdlle
la
neige
these
ladies
had
the
tranquil
manners
of
the
highest
gentility
in
my
cabin
is
a
great
buddha
on
his
throne
and
before
him
a
lacquer
tray
on
which
my
faithful
sailor
servant
places
any
small
change
he
may
find
lying
loose
in
the
pockets
of
my
clothes
madame
prune
whose
mind
is
much
swayed
by
mysticism
at
once
supposed
herself
before
a
regular
altar
in
the
gravest
manner
possible
she
addressed
a
brief
prayer
to
the
god
then
drawing
out
her
purse
which
according
to
custom
was
attached
to
her
sash
behind
her
back
along
with
her
little
pipe
and
placed
a
pious
offering
in
the
tray
while
executing
a
low
curtsey
they
remained
on
their
best
behavior
all
through
the
visit
but
when
the
moment
of
departure
came
chrysanthème
who
would
not
go
away
without
seeing
yves
asked
for
him
with
a
persistency
which
was
remarkable
yves
for
whom
i
then
sent
made
himself
particularly
charming
to
her
so
much
so
that
this
time
i
felt
a
shade
of
more
serious
annoyance
i
even
asked
myself
whether
the
laughably
pitiable
ending
which
i
had
hitherto
vaguely
foreseen
might
not
after
all
soon
break
upon
us
xlii
i
met
yesterday
in
an
old
and
ruined
quarter
of
the
town
a
perfectly
exquisite
mousmé
charmingly
dressed
a
fresh
note
of
color
against
the
dark
background
of
decayed
buildings
it
was
quite
at
the
farthest
end
of
nagasaki
in
the
most
ancient
part
of
the
town
in
this
region
are
trees
centuries
old
ancient
temples
of
buddha
of
amiddah
of
benten
or
kwanon
with
steep
and
pompous
roofs
monsters
carved
in
granite
sit
there
in
courtyards
silent
as
the
grave
where
the
grass
grows
between
the
this
deserted
quarter
is
traversed
by
a
narrow
torrent
running
in
a
deep
channel
across
which
are
thrown
little
curved
bridges
with
granite
balustrades
eaten
away
by
lichen
all
the
objects
there
wear
the
strange
grimace
the
quaint
arrangement
familiar
to
us
in
the
most
antique
japanese
drawings
i
walked
through
it
all
at
the
burning
hour
of
midday
and
saw
not
a
soul
unless
indeed
through
the
open
windows
of
the
i
caught
sight
of
some
priests
guardians
of
tombs
or
sanctuaries
taking
their
siesta
under
their
gauze
nets
all
at
once
this
little
mousmé
appeared
a
little
above
me
just
at
the
point
of
the
arch
of
one
of
these
bridges
carpeted
with
gray
moss
she
was
in
full
light
in
full
sunshine
and
stood
out
in
brilliant
clearness
like
a
fairy
vision
against
the
background
of
old
black
temples
and
deep
shadows
she
was
holding
her
dress
together
with
one
hand
gathering
it
close
round
her
ankles
to
give
herself
an
air
of
greater
slimness
over
her
quaint
little
head
her
round
umbrella
with
its
thousand
ribs
threw
a
great
halo
of
blue
and
red
edged
with
black
and
an
oleander
full
of
flowers
growing
among
the
stones
of
the
bridge
spread
its
glory
beside
her
bathed
like
herself
in
the
sunshine
behind
this
youthful
figure
and
this
flowering
shrub
all
was
blackness
upon
the
pretty
red
and
blue
parasol
great
white
letters
formed
this
inscription
much
used
among
the
mousmés
and
which
i
have
learned
to
recognize
clouds
to
see
her
pass
and
it
was
really
worth
the
trouble
to
stop
and
look
at
this
exquisite
little
person
of
a
type
so
ideally
japanese
however
it
will
not
do
to
stop
too
long
and
be
ensnared
it
would
only
be
another
a
doll
like
the
rest
evidently
an
ornament
for
a
china
shelf
and
nothing
more
while
i
gaze
at
her
i
say
to
myself
that
chrysanthème
appearing
in
this
same
place
with
this
dress
this
play
of
light
and
this
aureole
of
sunshine
would
produce
just
as
delightful
an
effect
for
chrysanthème
is
pretty
there
can
be
no
doubt
about
it
yesterday
evening
in
fact
i
positively
admired
her
it
was
quite
night
we
were
returning
with
the
usual
escort
of
little
married
couples
like
our
own
from
the
inevitable
tour
of
the
and
bazaars
while
the
other
mousmés
walked
along
hand
in
hand
adorned
with
new
silver
which
they
had
succeeded
in
having
presented
to
them
and
amusing
themselves
with
playthings
she
pleading
fatigue
followed
half
reclining
in
a
djin
carriage
we
had
placed
beside
her
great
bunches
of
flowers
destined
to
fill
our
vases
late
iris
and
lotus
the
last
of
the
season
already
smelling
of
autumn
and
it
was
really
very
pretty
to
see
this
japanese
girl
in
her
little
car
lying
carelessly
among
all
these
lighted
by
gleams
of
colors
as
they
chanced
from
the
lanterns
we
met
or
passed
if
on
the
evening
of
my
arrival
in
japan
any
one
had
pointed
her
out
to
me
and
said
that
shall
be
your
mousmé
there
can
not
be
a
doubt
i
should
have
been
charmed
in
reality
however
no
i
am
not
charmed
it
is
only
chrysanthème
always
chrysanthème
nothing
but
chrysanthème
a
mere
plaything
to
laugh
at
a
little
creature
of
finical
forms
and
thoughts
that
the
agency
of
kangourou
has
supplied
me
with
xliii
in
our
house
the
water
used
for
drinking
making
tea
and
lesser
washing
purposes
is
kept
in
large
white
china
tubs
decorated
with
paintings
representing
blue
fish
borne
along
by
a
swift
current
through
distorted
rushes
in
order
to
keep
them
cool
the
tubs
are
placed
out
of
doors
on
madame
prune
roof
at
a
place
where
we
can
from
the
top
of
our
projecting
balcony
easily
reach
them
by
stretching
out
the
arm
a
real
godsend
for
all
the
thirsty
cats
in
the
neighborhood
on
the
fine
summer
nights
is
this
corner
of
the
roof
with
our
bedaubed
tubs
and
it
proves
a
delightful
for
them
after
all
their
caterwauling
and
long
solitary
rambles
on
the
top
of
the
walls
i
had
thought
it
my
duty
to
warn
yves
the
first
time
he
wished
to
drink
this
water
oh
he
replied
rather
surprised
cats
do
you
say
they
are
not
dirty
on
this
point
chrysanthème
and
i
agree
with
him
we
do
not
consider
cats
as
unclean
animals
and
we
do
not
object
to
drink
after
them
yves
considers
chrysanthème
much
in
the
same
light
she
is
not
dirty
either
he
says
and
he
willingly
drinks
after
her
out
of
the
same
cup
putting
her
in
the
same
category
with
the
cats
well
these
china
tubs
are
one
of
the
daily
preoccupations
of
our
household
in
the
evening
when
we
return
from
our
walk
after
the
clamber
up
which
makes
us
thirsty
and
madame
waffles
which
we
have
been
eating
to
beguile
the
way
we
always
find
them
empty
it
seems
impossible
for
madame
prune
or
mdlle
oyouki
or
their
young
servant
mdlle
dédé
j
to
have
forethought
enough
to
fill
them
while
it
is
still
daylight
and
when
we
are
late
in
returning
home
these
three
ladies
are
asleep
so
we
are
obliged
to
attend
to
the
business
ourselves
footnote
j
means
miss
young
girl
a
very
common
name
we
must
therefore
open
all
the
closed
doors
put
on
our
boots
and
go
down
into
the
garden
to
draw
water
as
chrysanthème
would
die
of
fright
all
alone
in
the
dark
in
the
midst
of
the
trees
and
buzzing
of
the
insects
i
am
obliged
to
accompany
her
to
the
well
for
this
expedition
we
require
a
light
and
must
seek
among
the
quantity
of
lanterns
purchased
at
madame
booth
which
have
been
thrown
night
after
night
into
the
bottom
of
one
of
our
little
paper
closets
but
alas
all
the
candles
are
burnt
down
i
thought
as
much
well
we
must
resolutely
take
the
first
lantern
to
hand
and
stick
a
fresh
candle
on
the
iron
point
at
the
bottom
chrysanthème
puts
forth
all
her
strength
the
candle
splits
breaks
the
mousmé
pricks
her
fingers
pouts
and
whimpers
such
is
the
inevitable
scene
that
takes
place
every
evening
and
delays
our
retiring
to
rest
under
the
dark
blue
gauze
net
for
a
good
quarter
of
an
hour
while
the
cicalas
on
the
roof
seem
to
mock
us
with
their
ceaseless
song
all
this
which
i
should
find
amusing
in
any
one
else
any
one
i
loved
provokes
me
in
her
xliv
a
week
has
passed
by
peacefully
enough
during
which
i
have
written
down
nothing
little
by
little
i
am
becoming
accustomed
to
my
japanese
household
to
the
strangeness
of
the
language
costumes
and
faces
for
the
last
three
weeks
no
letters
have
arrived
from
europe
they
have
no
doubt
miscarried
and
their
absence
contributes
as
is
usually
the
case
to
throw
a
veil
of
oblivion
over
the
past
every
day
therefore
i
faithfully
climb
up
to
my
villa
sometimes
by
beautiful
nights
sometimes
through
stormy
downpours
of
rain
every
morning
as
the
sound
of
madame
prune
chanted
prayer
rises
through
the
reverberating
air
i
awake
and
go
down
towards
the
sea
by
the
grassy
pathways
full
of
dew
the
chief
occupation
of
this
japanese
country
seems
to
be
a
perpetual
hunt
after
curios
we
sit
down
on
the
mattings
in
the
little
booths
take
a
cup
of
tea
with
the
salesmen
and
rummage
with
our
own
hands
in
the
cupboards
and
chests
where
many
a
fantastic
piece
of
old
rubbish
is
huddled
away
the
bargaining
much
discussed
is
laughingly
carried
on
for
several
days
as
though
we
were
trying
to
play
off
some
excellent
little
practical
joke
upon
each
other
i
really
make
a
sad
abuse
of
the
adjective
i
am
quite
aware
of
it
but
how
can
i
do
otherwise
in
describing
this
country
the
temptation
is
great
to
use
it
ten
times
in
every
written
line
little
finical
affected
all
japan
is
contained
both
physically
and
morally
in
these
three
words
my
purchases
are
accumulating
up
there
in
my
little
wood
and
paper
house
but
how
much
more
japanese
it
really
was
in
its
bare
emptiness
such
as
sucre
and
madame
prune
had
conceived
it
there
are
now
many
lamps
of
a
religious
shape
hanging
from
the
ceiling
many
stools
and
many
vases
as
many
gods
and
goddesses
as
in
a
pagoda
there
is
even
a
little
shintoist
altar
before
which
madame
prune
has
not
been
able
to
restrain
her
feelings
and
before
which
she
has
fallen
down
and
chanted
her
prayers
in
her
bleating
old
voice
wash
me
clean
from
all
my
impurity
oh
as
one
washes
away
uncleanness
in
the
river
of
kamo
alas
for
poor
to
have
to
wash
away
the
impurities
of
madame
prune
what
a
tedious
and
ungrateful
task
chrysanthème
who
is
a
buddhist
prays
sometimes
in
the
evening
before
lying
down
although
overcome
with
sleep
she
prays
clapping
her
hands
before
the
largest
of
our
gilded
idols
but
she
smiles
with
a
childish
disrespect
for
her
buddha
directly
her
prayer
is
ended
i
know
that
she
has
also
a
certain
veneration
for
her
the
spirits
of
her
ancestors
whose
rather
sumptuous
altar
is
set
up
at
her
mother
madame
renoncule
she
asks
for
their
blessings
for
fortune
and
wisdom
who
can
make
out
her
ideas
about
the
gods
or
about
death
does
she
possess
a
soul
does
she
think
she
has
one
her
religion
is
an
obscure
chaos
of
theogonies
as
old
as
the
world
treasured
up
out
of
respect
for
ancient
customs
and
of
more
recent
ideas
about
the
blessed
final
annihilation
imported
from
india
at
the
epoch
of
our
middle
ages
by
saintly
chinese
missionaries
the
bonzes
themselves
are
puzzled
what
a
muddle
therefore
must
not
all
this
become
when
jumbled
together
in
the
childish
brain
of
a
sleepy
mousmé
two
very
insignificant
episodes
have
somewhat
attached
me
to
her
bonds
of
this
kind
seldom
fail
to
draw
closer
in
the
end
the
first
occasion
was
as
follows
madame
prune
one
day
brought
forth
a
relic
of
her
gay
youth
a
tortoiseshell
comb
of
rare
transparency
one
of
those
combs
that
it
is
good
style
to
place
on
the
summit
of
the
head
lightly
poised
scarcely
stuck
at
all
in
the
air
with
all
the
teeth
showing
taking
it
out
of
a
pretty
little
lacquered
box
she
held
it
up
in
the
air
and
blinked
her
eyes
looking
through
it
at
the
sky
a
bright
summer
sky
as
one
does
to
examine
the
quality
of
a
precious
stone
here
is
she
said
an
object
of
great
value
that
you
should
offer
to
your
little
wife
my
mousmé
very
much
taken
by
it
admired
the
clearness
of
the
comb
and
its
graceful
shape
the
lacquered
box
however
pleased
me
most
on
the
cover
was
a
wonderful
painting
in
gold
on
gold
representing
a
field
of
rice
seen
very
close
on
a
windy
day
a
tangle
of
ears
and
grass
beaten
down
and
twisted
by
a
terrible
squall
here
and
there
between
the
distorted
stalks
the
muddy
earth
of
the
was
visible
there
were
even
little
pools
of
water
produced
by
bits
of
the
transparent
lacquer
on
which
tiny
particles
of
gold
seemed
to
float
about
like
chaff
in
a
thick
liquid
two
or
three
insects
which
required
a
microscope
to
be
well
seen
were
clinging
in
a
terrified
manner
to
the
rushes
and
the
whole
picture
was
no
larger
than
a
woman
hand
as
for
madame
prune
comb
i
confess
it
left
me
indifferent
and
i
turned
a
deaf
ear
thinking
it
very
insignificant
and
expensive
then
chrysanthème
answered
mournfully
no
thank
you
i
do
want
it
take
it
away
dear
madame
prune
and
at
the
same
time
she
heaved
a
deep
sigh
full
of
meaning
which
plainly
said
he
is
not
so
fond
of
me
as
all
useless
to
bother
him
i
immediately
made
the
purchase
later
on
when
chrysanthème
will
have
become
an
old
monkey
like
madame
prune
with
her
black
teeth
and
long
orisons
she
in
her
turn
will
retail
that
comb
to
some
fine
lady
of
a
fresh
generation
on
another
occasion
the
sun
had
given
me
a
headache
i
lay
on
the
floor
resting
my
head
on
my
pillow
my
eyes
were
dim
and
everything
appeared
to
turn
round
the
open
verandah
the
big
expanse
of
luminous
evening
sky
and
a
variety
of
kites
hovering
against
its
background
i
felt
myself
vibrating
painfully
to
the
rhythmical
sound
of
the
cicalas
which
filled
the
atmosphere
she
crouching
down
by
my
side
strove
to
relieve
me
by
a
japanese
process
pressing
with
all
her
might
on
my
temples
with
her
little
thumbs
and
turning
them
rapidly
round
as
though
she
were
boring
a
hole
with
a
gimlet
she
had
become
quite
hot
and
red
over
this
hard
work
which
procured
me
real
comfort
something
similar
to
the
dreamy
intoxication
of
opium
then
anxious
and
fearful
lest
i
should
have
an
attack
of
fever
she
rolled
into
a
pellet
and
thrust
into
my
mouth
a
very
efficacious
prayer
written
on
which
she
carefully
kept
in
the
lining
of
one
of
her
sleeves
well
i
swallowed
that
prayer
without
a
smile
anxious
not
to
hurt
her
feelings
or
shake
her
funny
little
faith
xlv
yves
my
mousmé
and
myself
went
to
the
best
photographer
in
nagasaki
to
be
taken
in
a
group
together
we
shall
send
the
photograph
to
france
yves
already
smiles
as
he
thinks
of
his
wife
astonishment
when
she
sees
chrysanthème
little
face
between
us
two
and
he
wonders
what
explanation
he
will
give
her
well
i
will
just
say
it
is
one
of
your
friends
that
all
there
are
in
japan
photographers
in
the
style
of
our
own
with
this
one
difference
that
they
are
japanese
and
inhabit
japanese
houses
the
one
we
design
to
honor
carries
on
his
profession
in
the
suburbs
in
that
ancient
quarter
of
big
trees
and
gloomy
pagodas
where
the
other
day
i
met
the
pretty
little
mousmé
his
signboard
written
in
several
languages
is
stuck
up
against
a
wall
on
the
edge
of
the
little
torrent
which
rushing
down
from
the
green
mountain
above
is
crossed
by
many
a
curved
bridge
of
old
granite
and
lined
on
either
side
by
light
bamboos
or
oleanders
in
full
bloom
it
is
astonishing
and
puzzling
to
find
a
photographer
perched
there
in
the
very
heart
of
old
japan
we
have
come
at
the
wrong
moment
there
is
a
file
of
people
at
the
door
long
rows
of
djins
cars
are
stationed
there
awaiting
the
customers
they
have
brought
who
will
all
have
their
turn
before
us
the
runners
naked
and
tatooed
carefully
combed
in
sleek
bands
and
shiny
chignons
are
chatting
together
smoking
little
pipes
or
bathing
their
muscular
legs
in
the
fresh
water
of
the
torrent
the
courtyard
is
irreproachably
japanese
with
its
lanterns
and
dwarf
trees
but
the
studio
where
one
sits
might
be
in
paris
or
pontoise
the
chair
in
old
oak
the
same
faded
poufs
plaster
columns
and
pasteboard
rocks
the
people
who
are
being
at
this
moment
are
two
ladies
of
quality
evidently
mother
and
daughter
who
are
sitting
together
for
a
portrait
with
accessories
of
louis
xv
time
a
strange
group
this
the
first
great
ladies
of
this
country
i
have
seen
so
near
with
their
long
aristocratic
faces
dull
lifeless
almost
gray
by
dint
of
and
their
mouths
painted
in
vivid
carmine
withal
an
undeniable
look
of
good
breeding
that
strongly
impresses
us
notwithstanding
the
intrinsic
differences
of
races
and
acquired
notions
they
scanned
chrysanthème
with
an
obvious
look
of
scorn
although
her
costume
was
as
ladylike
as
their
own
for
my
part
i
could
not
take
my
eyes
off
these
two
creatures
they
captivated
me
like
incomprehensible
things
that
one
had
never
seen
before
their
fragile
bodies
outlandishly
graceful
in
posture
are
lost
in
stiff
materials
and
redundant
sashes
of
which
the
ends
droop
like
tired
wings
they
make
me
think
i
know
not
why
of
great
rare
insects
the
extraordinary
patterns
on
their
garments
have
something
of
the
dark
motley
of
above
all
the
mystery
of
their
tiny
slits
of
eyes
drawn
back
and
up
so
far
that
the
lids
can
scarcely
open
the
mystery
of
their
expression
which
seems
to
denote
inner
thoughts
of
a
silly
vague
complacent
absurdity
a
world
of
ideas
absolutely
closed
to
ourselves
and
i
think
as
i
gaze
at
them
how
far
we
are
from
this
japanese
people
how
utterly
dissimilar
are
our
races
then
we
have
to
let
several
english
sailors
pass
before
us
decked
out
in
their
white
drill
clothes
fresh
fat
and
pink
like
little
sugar
figures
who
attitudinize
in
a
sheepish
manner
round
the
shafts
of
the
columns
at
last
it
is
our
turn
chrysanthème
slowly
settles
herself
in
a
very
affected
style
turning
in
the
points
of
her
toes
as
much
as
possible
according
to
the
fashion
and
on
the
negative
we
are
shown
we
look
like
a
supremely
ridiculous
little
family
drawn
up
in
a
line
by
a
common
photographer
at
a
fair
xlvi
this
evening
yves
is
off
duty
three
hours
earlier
than
myself
from
time
to
time
this
is
the
case
according
to
the
arrangement
of
the
watches
on
those
occasions
he
lands
the
first
and
goes
up
to
wait
for
me
at
from
the
deck
i
can
see
him
through
the
glasses
climbing
up
the
green
mountain
path
he
walks
with
a
brisk
rapid
step
almost
running
what
a
hurry
he
seems
in
to
rejoin
little
chrysanthème
when
i
arrive
at
about
nine
i
find
him
seated
on
the
floor
in
the
middle
of
my
rooms
with
naked
torso
this
is
here
a
sufficiently
proper
costume
for
private
life
i
admit
around
him
are
grouped
chrysanthème
oyouki
and
mdlle
dédé
the
maid
all
eagerly
rubbing
his
back
with
little
blue
towels
decorated
with
storks
and
humorous
subjects
good
heavens
what
can
he
have
been
doing
to
be
so
hot
and
have
put
himself
in
such
a
state
he
tells
me
that
near
our
house
a
little
higher
up
the
mountain
he
has
discovered
a
fencing
gallery
that
till
nightfall
he
had
been
engaged
in
a
fencing
bout
against
japanese
who
fought
with
swords
springing
like
cats
as
is
the
custom
of
their
country
with
his
french
method
of
fencing
he
had
given
them
a
thorough
good
drubbing
upon
which
with
many
a
low
bow
they
had
shown
him
their
admiration
by
bringing
him
a
quantity
of
nice
little
iced
things
to
drink
all
this
combined
had
thrown
him
into
a
fearful
perspiration
ah
very
well
nevertheless
this
did
not
quite
explain
to
me
he
is
delighted
with
his
evening
intends
to
go
and
amuse
himself
every
day
by
beating
them
he
even
thinks
of
taking
pupils
once
his
back
dried
they
all
together
the
three
mousmés
and
himself
play
at
japanese
really
i
could
not
wish
for
anything
more
innocent
or
more
correct
in
every
respect
charles
n
and
madame
jonquille
his
wife
arrived
unexpectedly
at
about
ten
they
were
wandering
about
in
the
dark
shrubberies
in
our
neighborhood
and
seeing
our
lights
came
up
to
us
they
intend
to
finish
the
evening
at
the
of
the
toads
and
they
try
to
induce
us
to
go
and
drink
some
iced
sherbets
with
them
it
is
at
least
an
hour
walk
from
here
on
the
other
side
of
the
town
half
way
up
the
hill
in
the
gardens
of
the
large
pagoda
dedicated
to
osueva
but
they
stick
to
their
idea
pretending
that
in
this
clear
night
and
bright
moonlight
we
shall
have
a
lovely
view
from
the
terrace
of
the
temple
lovely
i
have
no
doubt
but
we
had
intended
going
to
bed
however
be
it
so
let
us
go
with
them
we
hire
five
djins
and
five
cars
down
below
in
the
principal
street
in
front
of
madame
shop
who
for
this
late
expedition
chooses
for
us
her
largest
round
lanterns
big
red
balloons
decorated
with
seaweed
and
green
sharks
it
is
nearly
eleven
when
we
make
our
start
in
the
central
quarters
the
virtuous
niponese
are
already
closing
their
little
booths
putting
out
their
lamps
shutting
the
wooden
framework
drawing
their
paper
panels
further
on
in
the
suburban
streets
all
is
shut
up
long
ago
and
our
carts
roll
on
through
the
black
night
we
cry
out
to
our
djins
ayakou
ayakou
quick
quick
and
they
run
as
hard
as
they
can
uttering
little
shrieks
like
some
merry
animal
full
of
wild
gayety
we
rush
like
a
whirlwind
through
the
darkness
all
five
in
indian
file
dashing
and
jolting
over
the
old
uneven
flagstones
dimly
lighted
up
by
our
red
balloons
fluttering
at
the
end
of
their
bamboo
stems
from
time
to
time
some
niponese
in
his
blue
kerchief
opens
a
window
to
see
who
these
noisy
madcaps
can
be
dashing
by
so
rapidly
and
so
late
or
else
some
faint
glimmer
thrown
by
us
on
our
passage
discovers
the
hideous
smile
of
a
large
stone
animal
seated
at
the
gate
of
a
pagoda
at
last
we
arrive
at
the
foot
of
osueva
temple
and
leaving
our
djins
with
our
little
gigs
we
clamber
up
the
gigantic
steps
completely
deserted
at
this
hour
of
the
night
chrysanthème
who
always
likes
to
play
the
part
of
a
tired
little
girl
of
a
spoilt
and
pouting
child
ascends
slowly
between
yves
and
myself
clinging
to
our
arms
jonquille
on
the
contrary
skips
up
like
a
bird
amusing
herself
by
counting
the
endless
steps
hitôts

she
lays
a
great

on
the
accentuations
as
though
to
make
the
numbers
sound
even
more
droll
a
little
silver
aigrette
glitters
in
her
beautiful
black
chignon
her
delicate
and
graceful
figure
seems
strangely
fantastic
and
the
darkness
that
envelops
us
conceals
the
fact
that
her
face
is
almost
ugly
and
almost
without
eyes
this
evening
chrysanthème
and
jonquille
really
look
like
little
fairies
at
certain
moments
the
most
insignificant
japanese
have
this
appearance
by
dint
of
whimsical
elegance
and
ingenious
arrangement
the
granite
stairs
immense
deserted
uniformly
gray
under
the
nocturnal
sky
seem
to
vanish
into
the
empty
space
above
us
and
when
we
turn
round
to
disappear
in
the
depths
beneath
to
fall
with
the
dizzy
rapidity
of
a
dream
into
the
abyss
below
on
the
sloping
steps
the
black
shadows
of
the
gateways
through
which
we
must
pass
stretch
out
inordinately
and
the
shadows
which
seem
to
be
broken
at
each
projecting
step
bear
on
all
their
extent
the
regular
creases
of
a
fan
the
porticos
stand
up
separately
rising
one
above
the
other
their
wonderful
shapes
are
at
once
remarkably
simple
and
studiously
affected
their
outlines
stand
out
sharp
and
distinct
having
nevertheless
the
vague
appearance
of
all
very
large
objects
in
the
pale
moonlight
the
curved
architraves
rise
up
at
each
extremity
like
two
menacing
horns
pointing
upwards
towards
the
blue
canopy
of
sky
bespangled
with
stars
as
thought
they
would
communicate
to
the
gods
the
knowledge
they
have
acquired
in
the
depths
of
their
foundations
from
the
earth
full
of
sepulchers
and
death
which
surrounds
them
we
are
indeed
a
very
small
group
lost
now
in
the
immensity
of
the
colossal
acclivity
as
we
move
onwards
lighted
partly
by
the
wan
moon
on
high
partly
by
the
red
lanterns
we
hold
in
our
hands
ever
floating
at
the
end
of
their
long
sticks
a
deep
silence
reigns
in
the
precincts
of
the
temple
the
sound
of
the
insects
even
is
hushed
as
we
ascend
higher
a
sort
of
reverence
a
kind
of
religious
fear
steals
over
us
and
at
the
same
moment
a
delicious
coolness
suddenly
pervades
the
air
and
passes
over
us
on
entering
the
courtyard
above
we
feel
a
little
daunted
here
we
find
the
horse
in
jade
and
the
china
turrets
the
enclosing
walls
make
it
the
more
gloomy
and
our
arrival
seems
to
disturb
i
know
not
what
mysterious
council
held
between
the
spirits
of
the
air
and
the
visible
symbols
that
are
there
chimeras
and
monsters
lit
up
by
the
blue
rays
of
the
moon
we
turn
to
the
left
and
go
through
the
terraced
gardens
to
reach
the
of
the
toads
which
this
evening
is
our
goal
we
find
it
shut
up
expected
as
much
closed
and
dark
at
this
hour
we
drum
all
together
on
the
door
in
the
most
coaxing
tones
we
call
by
name
the
we
know
so
well
mdlle
transparente
mdlle
etoile
mdlle
roséematinale
and
mdlle
not
an
answer
goodbye
perfumed
sherbets
and
frosted
beans
in
front
of
the
little
our
mousmés
suddenly
start
on
one
side
terrified
and
declaring
that
there
is
a
dead
body
on
the
ground
yes
indeed
someone
is
lying
there
we
cautiously
examine
the
place
by
the
light
of
our
red
balloons
carefully
held
out
at
length
for
fear
of
this
dead
man
it
is
only
the
marksman
he
who
on
the
of
july
chose
such
magnificent
arrows
for
chrysanthème
and
he
sleeps
good
man
with
his
chignon
somewhat
dishevelled
a
sound
sleep
which
it
would
be
cruel
to
disturb
let
us
go
to
the
end
of
the
terrace
contemplate
the
roadstead
at
our
feet
and
then
return
home
the
harbor
looks
only
like
a
dark
and
sinister
rent
which
the
moonbeams
can
not
fathom
a
yawning
crevasse
opening
into
the
very
bowels
of
the
earth
at
the
bottom
of
which
lie
faint
and
small
glimmers
an
assembly
of
in
a
ditch
the
lights
of
the
different
vessels
lying
at
anchor
xlvii
it
is
the
middle
of
the
night
somewhere
about
two
in
the
morning
our
are
burning
still
a
little
dimly
in
front
of
our
peaceful
idols
chrysanthème
wakes
me
suddenly
and
i
turn
to
look
at
her
she
has
raised
herself
on
one
arm
and
her
face
expresses
the
most
intense
terror
she
makes
me
a
sign
without
daring
to
speak
that
someone
is
near
or
something
creeping
up
to
us
what
visit
is
this
a
feeling
of
fear
gains
possession
of
me
also
i
have
a
rapid
impression
of
some
immense
unknown
danger
in
this
isolated
spot
in
this
strange
country
of
which
i
do
not
even
yet
comprehend
the
inhabitants
and
the
mysteries
it
must
be
something
very
frightful
to
hold
her
there
rooted
to
the
spot
half
dead
with
fright
she
who
comprehend
all
these
things
it
would
seem
to
be
outside
it
is
coming
from
the
garden
with
trembling
hand
she
indicates
to
me
that
it
will
come
through
the
verandah
over
madame
prune
roof
certainly
i
can
hear
faint
noises
and
they
do
approach
nearer
i
suggest
to
her
it
is
the
cats
no
she
replies
still
terrified
and
in
an
alarming
tone
is
it
my
lords
the
ghosts
i
have
already
the
japanese
habit
of
expressing
myself
with
excessive
politeness
dorobo
thieves
thieves
ah
this
is
better
i
much
prefer
this
to
a
visit
such
as
i
have
just
been
dreading
in
the
sudden
awakening
from
sleep
from
ghosts
or
spirits
of
the
dead
thieves
that
is
to
say
worthy
fellows
very
much
alive
and
having
undoubtedly
in
as
much
as
they
are
japanese
thieves
faces
of
the
most
meritorious
oddity
i
am
not
in
the
least
frightened
now
that
i
know
precisely
what
to
expect
and
we
will
immediately
set
to
work
to
ascertain
the
truth
for
something
is
decidedly
moving
on
madame
prune
roof
some
one
is
walking
upon
it
i
open
one
of
our
wooden
panels
and
look
out
i
can
see
only
a
vast
expanse
calm
peaceful
and
exquisite
under
the
full
brilliancy
of
the
moonlight
sleeping
japan
lulled
by
the
sonorous
song
of
the
grasshoppers
is
charming
indeed
and
the
free
pure
air
is
delicious
to
breathe
chrysanthème
half
hidden
behind
my
shoulder
listens
tremblingly
peering
forward
to
examine
the
gardens
and
the
roofs
with
dilated
eyes
like
a
frightened
cat
no
nothing
not
a
thing
moves
here
and
there
are
a
few
strangely
substantial
shadows
which
at
the
first
glance
were
not
easy
to
explain
but
which
turn
out
to
be
real
shadows
thrown
by
bits
of
wall
by
boughs
of
trees
and
which
preserve
an
extremely
reassuring
stillness
everything
seems
absolutely
tranquil
and
profound
silence
reigns
in
the
dreamy
vagueness
which
moonlight
sheds
over
all
nothing
nothing
to
be
seen
anywhere
it
was
messrs
the
cats
after
all
or
perhaps
my
ladies
the
owls
sounds
increase
in
volume
in
the
most
amazing
manner
at
night
in
this
house
of
ours
let
us
close
the
panel
again
carefully
as
a
measure
of
prudence
and
then
light
a
lantern
and
go
downstairs
to
see
if
there
may
be
any
one
hidden
in
corners
and
if
the
doors
are
tightly
shut
in
short
to
reassure
chrysanthème
we
will
go
the
round
of
the
house
behold
us
then
on
searching
together
every
hole
and
corner
of
the
house
which
to
judge
by
its
foundations
must
be
very
ancient
notwithstanding
the
fragile
appearance
of
its
panels
of
white
paper
it
contains
the
blackest
of
cavities
little
vaulted
cellars
with
beams
cupboards
for
rice
which
smell
of
mould
and
decay
mysterious
hollows
where
lies
accumulated
the
dust
of
centuries
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
during
a
hunt
for
thieves
this
part
of
the
house
as
yet
unknown
to
me
has
an
ugly
look
noiselessly
we
step
across
the
apartment
of
our
landlord
and
landlady
chrysanthème
drags
me
by
the
hand
and
i
allow
myself
to
be
led
there
they
are
sleeping
in
a
row
under
their
blue
gauze
tent
lighted
by
the
burning
before
the
altars
of
their
ancestors
ha
i
observe
that
they
are
arranged
in
an
order
which
might
give
rise
to
gossip
first
comes
mdlle
oyouki
very
taking
in
her
attitude
of
rest
then
madame
prune
who
sleeps
with
her
mouth
wide
open
showing
her
rows
of
blackened
teeth
from
her
throat
arises
an
intermittent
sound
like
the
grunting
of
a
sow
oh
poor
madame
prune
how
hideous
she
is
next
sucre
a
mere
mummy
for
the
time
being
and
finally
at
his
side
last
of
the
row
is
their
servant
mdlle
dédé
the
gauze
hanging
over
them
throws
reflections
as
of
the
sea
upon
them
one
might
suppose
them
victims
drowned
in
an
aquarium
and
withal
the
sacred
lamps
the
altar
crowded
with
strange
shintoist
symbols
give
a
mock
religious
air
to
this
family
picture
soit
qui
mal
y
but
why
is
not
that
rather
laid
by
the
side
of
her
mistresses
now
when
we
on
the
floor
above
offer
our
hospitality
to
yves
we
are
careful
to
place
ourselves
under
our
in
a
more
correct
style
one
corner
which
as
a
last
resort
we
inspect
inspires
me
with
a
certain
amount
of
apprehension
it
is
a
low
mysterious
loft
against
the
door
of
which
is
stuck
as
a
thing
no
longer
wanted
a
very
old
pious
image
with
the
thousand
arms
and
kwanon
with
the
horses
seated
among
clouds
and
flames
and
horrible
both
of
them
to
behold
with
their
spectral
grin
we
open
the
door
and
chrysanthème
starts
back
uttering
a
fearful
cry
i
should
have
thought
the
robbers
were
there
had
i
not
seen
a
little
grey
creature
rapid
and
noiseless
rush
by
her
and
disappear
a
young
rat
that
had
been
eating
rice
on
the
top
of
a
shelf
and
in
its
alarm
had
dashed
in
her
face
xlviii
yves
has
dropped
his
silver
whistle
in
the
sea
the
whistle
so
absolutely
indispensable
for
the
maneuvers
and
we
search
the
town
through
all
day
long
followed
by
chrysanthème
and
mdlles
la
neige
and
la
lune
her
sisters
in
the
endeavor
to
procure
another
it
is
however
very
difficult
to
find
such
a
thing
in
nagasaki
above
all
very
difficult
to
explain
in
japanese
what
is
a
sailor
whistle
of
the
traditional
shape
curved
and
with
a
little
ball
at
the
end
to
modulate
the
trills
and
the
various
sounds
of
official
orders
for
three
hours
we
are
sent
from
shop
to
shop
at
each
one
they
pretend
to
understand
perfectly
what
is
wanted
and
trace
on
with
a
the
addresses
of
the
shops
where
we
shall
without
fail
meet
with
what
we
require
away
we
go
full
of
hope
only
to
encounter
some
fresh
mystification
till
our
breathless
djins
get
quite
bewildered
they
understand
admirably
that
we
want
a
thing
that
will
make
a
noise
music
in
short
thereupon
they
offer
us
instruments
of
every
and
the
most
unexpected
shape
squeakers
for
voices
trumpets
each
time
it
is
something
more
and
more
absurd
so
that
at
last
we
are
overcome
with
uncontrollable
fits
of
laughter
last
of
all
an
aged
japanese
optician
who
assumes
a
most
knowing
air
a
look
of
sublime
wisdom
goes
off
to
forage
in
his
back
shop
and
brings
to
light
a
steam
a
relic
from
some
wrecked
steamer
after
dinner
the
chief
event
of
the
evening
is
a
deluge
of
rain
which
takes
us
by
surprise
as
we
leave
the
on
our
return
from
our
fashionable
stroll
it
so
happened
that
we
were
a
large
party
having
with
us
several
mousmé
guests
and
from
the
moment
that
the
rain
began
to
fall
from
the
skies
as
if
out
of
a
turned
upside
down
the
band
became
disorganized
the
mousmés
run
off
with
birdlike
cries
and
take
refuge
under
in
the
shops
under
the
hoods
of
the
djins
then
before
long
when
the
shops
shut
up
in
haste
when
the
emptied
streets
are
flooded
and
almost
black
and
the
paper
lanterns
piteous
objects
wet
through
and
extinguished
i
find
myself
i
know
not
how
it
happens
flattened
against
a
wall
under
the
projecting
eaves
alone
in
the
company
of
mdlle
fraise
my
cousin
who
is
crying
bitterly
because
her
fine
dress
is
wet
through
and
in
the
noise
of
the
rain
which
is
still
falling
and
splashing
everything
with
the
spouts
and
gutters
which
in
the
darkness
plaintively
murmur
like
running
streams
the
town
appears
to
me
suddenly
an
abode
of
the
gloomiest
sadness
the
shower
is
soon
over
and
the
mousmés
come
out
of
their
holes
like
so
many
mice
they
look
for
each
other
call
each
other
and
their
little
voices
take
the
singular
melancholy
dragging
inflections
they
assume
whenever
they
have
to
call
from
afar
hi
mdlle
une
hi
madame
ille
they
shout
from
one
to
the
other
their
outlandish
names
prolonging
them
indefinitely
in
the
now
silent
night
in
the
reverberations
of
the
damp
air
after
the
great
summer
rain
at
length
they
are
all
collected
and
united
again
these
tiny
personages
with
narrow
eyes
and
no
brains
and
we
return
to
all
wet
through
for
the
third
time
we
have
yves
sleeping
beside
us
under
our
blue
tent
there
is
a
great
row
soon
after
midnight
in
the
apartment
beneath
us
our
landlord
family
returning
from
a
pilgrimage
to
a
temple
of
the
goddess
of
grace
although
madame
prune
is
a
shintoist
she
reveres
this
deity
who
scandal
says
watched
over
her
youth
a
moment
after
mdlle
oyouki
bursts
into
our
room
like
a
rocket
bringing
on
a
charming
little
tray
sweetmeats
which
have
been
blessed
and
bought
at
the
gates
of
the
temple
yonder
on
purpose
for
us
and
which
we
must
positively
eat
at
once
before
the
virtue
is
gone
out
of
them
scarcely
rousing
ourselves
we
absorb
these
little
edibles
flavored
with
sugar
and
pepper
and
return
a
great
many
sleepy
thanks
yves
sleeps
quietly
on
this
occasion
without
dealing
any
blows
to
the
floor
or
the
panels
either
with
fists
or
feet
he
has
hung
his
watch
on
one
of
the
hands
of
our
gilded
idol
in
order
to
be
more
sure
of
seeing
the
hour
at
any
time
of
the
night
by
the
light
of
the
sacred
lamps
he
gets
up
betimes
in
the
morning
asking
well
did
i
behave
properly
and
dresses
in
haste
preoccupied
about
duty
and
the
outside
no
doubt
it
is
daylight
already
through
the
tiny
holes
which
time
has
pierced
in
our
wooden
panels
threads
of
morning
light
penetrate
our
chamber
and
in
the
atmosphere
of
our
room
where
night
still
lingers
they
trace
vague
white
rays
soon
when
the
sun
shall
have
risen
these
rays
will
lengthen
and
become
beautifully
golden
the
cocks
and
the
cicalas
make
themselves
heard
and
now
madame
prune
will
begin
her
mystic
drone
nevertheless
out
of
politeness
for
chrysanthème
lights
a
lantern
and
escorts
him
to
the
foot
of
the
dark
staircase
i
even
fancy
that
on
parting
i
hear
a
kiss
exchanged
in
japan
this
is
of
no
consequence
that
i
know
it
is
very
usual
and
quite
admissible
no
matter
where
one
goes
in
houses
one
enters
for
the
first
time
one
is
quite
at
liberty
to
kiss
any
mousmé
who
may
be
present
without
any
notice
being
taken
of
it
but
with
regard
to
chrysanthème
yves
is
in
a
delicate
position
and
he
ought
to
understand
it
better
i
begin
to
feel
uneasy
about
the
hours
they
have
so
often
spent
together
alone
and
i
make
up
my
mind
that
this
very
day
i
will
not
play
the
spy
upon
them
but
speak
frankly
to
yves
and
make
a
clear
breast
of
it
all
at
once
from
below
clac
two
dry
hands
clapped
together
it
is
madame
prune
warning
to
the
great
spirit
and
immediately
after
her
prayer
breaks
forth
soars
upwards
in
a
shrill
nasal
falsetto
like
a
morning
alarm
when
the
hour
for
waking
has
come
the
mechanical
noise
of
a
spring
let
go
and
running
down
the
richest
woman
in
the
world
cleansed
from
all
my
sins
o
in
the
river
of
kamo
and
this
extraordinary
bleating
scarcely
human
scatters
and
changes
my
ideas
which
were
very
nearly
clear
at
the
moment
i
awoke
xlix
there
is
a
rumor
of
departure
in
the
air
since
yesterday
there
has
been
vague
talk
of
our
being
sent
to
china
to
the
gulf
of
pekin
one
of
those
rumors
which
spread
no
one
knows
how
from
one
end
of
the
ship
to
the
other
two
or
three
days
before
the
official
orders
arrive
and
which
generally
turn
out
tolerably
correct
what
will
the
last
act
of
my
little
japanese
comedy
be
like
the
dénouement
the
separation
will
there
be
any
touch
of
sadness
on
the
part
of
my
mousmé
or
on
my
own
just
a
tightening
of
the
at
the
moment
of
our
final
farewell
at
this
moment
i
can
imagine
nothing
of
the
sort
and
then
the
adieux
of
yves
and
chrysanthème
what
will
they
be
this
question
preoccupies
me
more
than
all
there
is
nothing
very
precise
as
yet
but
it
is
certain
that
one
way
or
another
our
stay
in
japan
is
coming
to
an
end
it
is
this
perhaps
which
disposes
me
this
evening
to
throw
a
more
friendly
glance
on
my
surroundings
it
is
about
six
after
a
day
spent
on
duty
when
i
reach
the
evening
sun
low
in
the
sky
on
the
point
of
setting
pours
into
my
room
and
floods
it
with
rays
of
red
gold
lighting
up
the
buddhas
and
the
great
sheaves
of
quaintly
arranged
flowers
in
the
antique
vases
here
are
assembled
five
or
six
little
dolls
my
neighbors
amusing
themselves
by
dancing
to
the
sound
of
chrysanthème
guitar
and
this
evening
i
experience
a
real
charm
in
feeling
that
this
dwelling
and
the
woman
who
leads
the
dance
are
mine
on
the
whole
i
have
perhaps
been
unjust
to
this
country
it
seems
to
me
that
my
eyes
are
at
last
opened
to
see
it
in
its
true
light
that
all
my
senses
are
undergoing
a
strange
and
abrupt
transition
i
suddenly
have
a
better
perception
and
appreciation
of
all
the
infinity
of
dainty
trifles
amongst
which
i
live
of
the
fragile
and
studied
grace
of
their
forms
the
oddity
of
their
drawings
the
refined
choice
of
their
colors
i
stretch
myself
upon
the
white
mats
chrysanthème
always
eagerly
attentive
brings
me
my
pillow
of
serpent
skin
and
the
smiling
mousmés
with
the
interrupted
rhythm
of
a
while
ago
still
running
in
their
heads
move
round
me
with
measured
steps
their
irreproachable
socks
with
the
separate
great
toes
make
no
noise
nothing
is
heard
as
they
glide
by
but
a
froufrou
of
silken
stuffs
i
find
them
all
pleasant
to
look
upon
their
dollish
air
has
the
gift
of
pleasing
me
now
and
i
fancy
i
have
discovered
what
it
is
that
gives
it
to
them
it
is
not
only
their
round
inexpressive
faces
with
eyebrows
far
removed
from
the
eyelids
but
the
excessive
amplitude
of
their
dress
with
those
huge
sleeves
it
might
be
supposed
they
have
neither
back
nor
shoulders
their
delicate
figures
are
lost
in
these
wide
robes
which
float
around
what
might
be
little
marionnettes
without
bodies
at
all
and
which
would
slip
to
the
ground
of
themselves
were
they
not
kept
together
midway
about
where
a
waist
should
be
by
the
wide
silken
sashes
a
very
different
comprehension
of
the
art
of
dressing
to
ours
which
endeavors
as
much
as
possible
to
bring
into
relief
the
curves
real
or
false
of
the
figure
and
then
how
much
i
admire
the
flowers
arranged
by
chrysanthème
in
our
vases
with
her
japanese
taste
lotus
flowers
great
sacred
flowers
of
a
tender
veined
the
milky
seen
on
porcelain
they
resemble
when
in
full
bloom
great
and
when
only
in
bud
might
be
taken
for
long
pale
tulips
their
soft
but
rather
cloying
scent
is
added
to
that
other
indefinable
odor
of
mousmés
of
yellow
race
of
japan
which
is
always
and
everywhere
in
the
air
the
late
flowers
of
september
at
this
season
very
rare
and
expensive
grow
on
longer
stems
than
the
summer
blooms
chrysanthème
has
left
them
their
immense
aquatic
leaves
of
a
melancholy
and
mingled
with
them
tall
slight
rushes
i
look
at
them
and
recall
with
some
irony
those
great
round
bunches
in
the
shape
of
cauliflowers
which
our
florists
sell
in
france
wrapt
in
their
white
still
no
letters
from
europe
from
any
one
how
things
change
become
effaced
and
forgotten
here
i
am
accommodating
myself
to
this
finical
japan
and
dwindling
down
to
its
affected
mannerism
i
feel
that
my
thoughts
run
in
smaller
grooves
my
tastes
incline
to
smaller
things
things
which
suggest
nothing
greater
than
a
smile
i
am
becoming
used
to
tiny
and
ingenious
furniture
to
desks
to
miniature
bowls
with
which
to
play
at
dinner
to
the
immaculate
monotony
of
the
mats
to
the
finely
finished
simplicity
of
the
white
woodwork
i
am
even
losing
my
western
prejudices
all
my
preconceived
ideas
are
this
evening
evaporating
and
vanishing
crossing
the
garden
i
have
courteously
saluted
sucre
who
was
watering
his
dwarf
shrubs
and
his
deformed
flowers
and
madame
prune
appears
to
me
a
highly
respectable
old
lady
in
whose
past
there
is
nothing
to
criticise
we
shall
take
no
walk
my
only
wish
is
to
remain
stretched
out
where
i
am
listening
to
the
music
of
my
mousmé
till
now
i
have
always
used
the
word
to
avoid
exotic
terms
for
the
abuse
of
which
i
have
been
so
reproached
but
neither
the
word
nor
suffices
to
designate
this
slender
instrument
with
its
long
neck
the
high
notes
of
which
are
shriller
than
the
voice
of
the
grasshopper
henceforth
i
will
write
i
will
also
call
my
mousmé
this
name
suits
her
better
than
chrysanthème
which
though
translating
the
sense
exactly
does
not
preserve
the
euphony
of
the
original
i
therefore
say
to
kikou
my
wife
play
play
on
for
me
i
shall
remain
here
all
the
evening
and
listen
to
you
astonished
to
find
me
in
so
amiable
a
mood
she
requires
pressing
a
little
and
with
almost
a
bitter
curve
of
triumph
and
disdain
about
her
lips
she
seats
herself
in
the
attitude
of
an
idol
raises
her
long
sleeves
and
begins
the
first
hesitating
notes
are
murmured
faintly
and
mingle
with
the
music
of
the
insects
humming
outside
in
the
quiet
air
of
the
warm
and
golden
twilight
first
she
plays
slowly
a
confused
medley
of
fragments
which
she
does
not
seem
to
remember
perfectly
of
which
one
waits
for
the
finish
and
waits
in
vain
while
the
other
girls
giggle
inattentive
and
regretful
of
their
interrupted
dance
she
herself
is
absent
sulky
as
though
she
were
performing
a
duty
only
then
by
degrees
little
by
little
it
becomes
more
animated
and
the
mousmés
begin
to
listen
now
tremblingly
it
grows
into
a
feverish
rapidity
and
her
gaze
has
no
longer
the
vacant
stare
of
a
doll
then
the
music
changes
again
in
it
there
is
the
sighing
of
the
wind
the
hideous
laughter
of
ghouls
tears
heartrending
plaints
and
her
dilated
pupils
seem
to
be
directed
inwardly
in
settled
gaze
on
some
indescribable
within
her
own
soul
i
listen
lying
there
with
eyes
half
shut
looking
out
between
my
drooping
eyelids
which
are
gradually
lowering
in
involuntary
heaviness
upon
the
enormous
red
sun
dying
away
over
nagasaki
i
have
a
somewhat
melancholy
feeling
that
my
past
life
and
all
other
places
in
the
world
are
receding
from
my
view
and
fading
away
at
this
moment
of
nightfall
i
feel
almost
at
home
in
this
corner
of
japan
amidst
the
gardens
of
this
suburb
i
have
never
had
such
an
impression
before
seven
in
the
evening
we
shall
not
go
down
into
the
town
but
like
good
japanese
citizens
remain
in
our
loftly
suburb
in
undress
uniform
we
shall
go
yves
and
i
in
a
neighborly
way
as
far
as
the
fencing
gallery
which
is
only
two
steps
off
just
above
our
villa
and
almost
abutting
on
our
fresh
and
scented
garden
the
gallery
is
closed
already
and
a
little
mousko
seated
at
the
door
explains
with
many
low
bows
that
we
come
too
late
all
the
amateurs
are
gone
we
must
come
again
the
evening
is
so
mild
and
so
fine
that
we
remain
out
of
doors
following
without
any
definite
purpose
the
pathway
which
rises
ever
higher
and
higher
and
loses
itself
at
length
in
the
solitary
regions
of
the
mountain
among
the
upper
peaks
for
an
hour
at
least
we
wander
on
an
unintended
walk
and
finally
find
ourselves
at
a
great
height
commanding
an
endless
perspective
lighted
by
the
last
gleams
of
daylight
we
are
in
a
desolate
and
mournful
spot
in
the
midst
of
the
little
buddhist
cemeteries
which
are
scattered
over
the
country
in
every
direction
we
meet
a
few
belated
laborers
who
are
returning
from
the
fields
with
bundles
of
tea
upon
their
shoulders
these
peasants
have
a
half
savage
air
half
naked
too
or
clothed
only
in
long
robes
of
blue
cotton
as
they
pass
they
salute
us
with
humble
bows
no
trees
in
this
elevated
region
fields
of
tea
alternate
with
tombs
old
granite
statues
which
represent
buddha
in
his
lotus
or
else
old
monumental
stones
on
which
gleam
remains
of
inscriptions
in
golden
letters
rocks
brushwood
uncultivated
spaces
surround
us
on
all
sides
there
are
no
more
and
the
light
is
failing
we
will
halt
for
a
moment
and
then
it
will
be
time
to
turn
our
steps
downwards
but
close
to
the
spot
where
we
stand
a
box
in
white
wood
provided
with
handles
a
sort
of
rests
on
the
freshly
disturbed
earth
with
its
lotus
of
silvered
paper
and
the
little
burning
yet
by
its
side
clearly
someone
has
been
buried
here
this
very
evening
i
can
not
picture
this
personage
to
myself
the
japanese
are
so
grotesque
in
life
that
it
is
almost
impossible
to
imagine
them
in
the
calm
majesty
of
death
nevertheless
let
us
move
further
on
we
might
disturb
him
he
is
too
recently
dead
his
presence
unnerves
us
we
will
go
and
seat
ourselves
on
one
of
these
other
tombs
so
unutterably
ancient
that
there
can
no
longer
be
anything
within
it
but
dust
and
there
seated
yet
in
the
dying
sunlight
while
the
valleys
and
plains
of
the
earth
below
are
already
lost
in
shadow
we
will
talk
together
i
wish
to
speak
to
yves
about
chrysanthème
it
is
indeed
somewhat
in
view
of
this
that
i
have
persuaded
him
to
sit
down
but
how
to
set
about
it
without
hurting
his
feelings
and
without
making
myself
ridiculous
i
hardly
know
however
the
pure
air
playing
round
me
up
here
and
the
magnificent
landscape
spread
beneath
my
feet
impart
a
certain
serenity
to
my
thoughts
which
makes
me
feel
a
contemptuous
pity
both
for
my
suspicions
and
the
cause
of
them
we
speak
first
of
all
of
the
order
for
departure
which
may
arrive
at
any
moment
for
china
or
for
france
soon
we
shall
have
to
leave
this
easy
and
almost
amusing
life
this
japanese
suburb
where
chance
has
installed
us
and
our
little
house
buried
among
flowers
yves
perhaps
will
regret
all
this
more
than
i
shall
i
know
that
well
enough
for
it
is
the
first
time
that
any
such
interlude
has
broken
the
rude
monotony
of
his
career
formerly
when
in
an
inferior
rank
he
was
scarcely
more
often
on
shore
in
foreign
countries
than
the
themselves
whilst
i
have
from
the
very
beginning
been
spoilt
by
residence
in
all
sorts
of
charming
spots
infinitely
superior
to
this
in
all
sorts
of
countries
and
the
remembrance
pleasurably
haunts
me
still
in
order
to
discover
how
the
land
lies
i
risk
the
remark
you
will
perhaps
be
more
sorry
to
leave
this
little
chrysanthème
than
i
am
silence
reigns
between
us
after
which
i
pursue
and
burning
my
ships
i
add
you
know
after
all
if
you
have
such
a
fancy
for
her
i
really
married
her
one
ca
really
consider
her
my
wife
in
great
surprise
he
looks
in
my
face
not
your
wife
you
say
but
by
jove
though
that
just
it
she
is
your
wife
there
is
no
need
of
many
words
at
any
time
between
us
two
i
know
exactly
now
by
his
tone
by
his
great
smile
how
the
case
stands
i
understand
all
that
lies
in
the
little
phrase
just
it
she
is
your
wife
if
she
were
not
well
then
he
could
not
answer
for
what
might
happen
notwithstanding
any
remorse
he
might
have
in
the
depths
of
his
heart
since
he
is
no
longer
a
bachelor
and
free
as
air
as
in
former
days
but
he
considers
her
my
wife
and
she
is
sacred
i
have
the
fullest
faith
in
his
word
and
i
experience
a
positive
relief
a
real
joy
at
finding
my
staunch
yves
of
bygone
days
how
could
i
have
so
succumbed
to
the
demeaning
influence
of
my
surroundings
as
to
suspect
him
even
and
invent
for
myself
such
a
mean
petty
anxiety
we
will
never
even
mention
that
doll
again
we
remain
up
there
very
late
talking
of
other
things
gazing
the
while
at
the
immense
depths
below
our
feet
at
the
valleys
and
mountains
as
they
become
one
by
one
indistinct
and
lost
in
the
deepening
darkness
placed
as
we
are
at
an
enormous
height
in
the
wide
free
atmosphere
we
seem
already
to
have
quitted
this
miniature
country
already
to
be
freed
from
the
impression
of
littleness
which
it
has
given
us
and
from
the
little
links
by
which
it
was
beginning
to
bind
us
to
itself
seen
from
such
heights
as
these
all
the
countries
of
the
globe
bear
a
strong
resemblance
to
each
other
they
lose
the
imprint
made
upon
them
by
man
and
by
races
by
all
the
atoms
swarming
on
the
surface
as
of
old
in
the
breton
marshes
in
the
woods
of
toulven
or
at
sea
in
the
we
talk
of
all
those
things
to
which
thoughts
naturally
revert
in
darkness
of
ghosts
of
spirits
of
eternity
of
the
great
hereafter
of
chaos
and
we
entirely
forget
little
chrysanthème
when
we
arrive
at
in
the
starry
night
it
is
the
music
of
her
heard
from
afar
which
recalls
to
us
her
existence
she
is
studying
some
vocal
duet
with
mdlle
oyouki
her
pupil
i
feel
myself
in
very
good
humor
this
evening
and
relieved
from
any
absurd
suspicions
about
my
poor
yves
am
quite
disposed
to
enjoy
without
reserve
my
last
days
in
japan
and
derive
therefrom
all
the
amusement
possible
let
us
then
stretch
ourselves
out
on
the
dazzling
white
mats
and
listen
to
the
singular
duet
sung
by
these
two
mousmés
a
strange
musical
medley
slow
and
mournful
beginning
with
two
or
three
high
notes
and
descending
at
each
couplet
in
almost
an
imperceptible
manner
into
actual
solemnity
the
song
keeps
its
dragging
slowness
but
the
accompaniment
becoming
more
and
more
accentuated
is
like
the
impetuous
sound
of
a
hurricane
at
the
end
when
these
girlish
voices
generally
so
soft
give
out
their
hoarse
and
guttural
notes
chrysanthème
hands
fly
wildly
and
convulsively
over
the
quivering
strings
both
of
them
lower
their
heads
pout
their
in
the
effort
of
bringing
out
these
astonishingly
deep
notes
and
at
these
moments
their
little
narrow
eyes
open
and
seem
to
reveal
an
unexpected
something
almost
a
soul
under
these
trappings
of
marionnettes
but
it
is
a
soul
which
more
than
ever
appears
to
me
of
a
different
species
to
my
own
i
feel
my
thoughts
to
be
far
removed
from
theirs
as
from
the
flitting
conceptions
of
a
bird
or
the
dreams
of
a
monkey
i
feel
there
is
betwixt
them
and
myself
a
great
gulf
mysterious
and
awful
other
sounds
of
music
wafted
to
us
from
the
distance
outside
interrupt
for
a
moment
that
of
our
mousmés
from
the
depths
below
down
in
nagasaki
arises
a
sudden
noise
of
gongs
and
guitars
we
rush
to
the
balcony
of
the
verandah
to
hear
it
better
it
is
a
a
fête
a
procession
passing
through
the
quarter
which
is
not
so
virtuous
as
our
own
so
our
mousmés
tell
us
with
a
disdainful
toss
of
the
head
nevertheless
from
the
heights
on
which
we
dwell
seen
thus
in
a
view
by
the
uncertain
light
of
the
stars
this
district
has
a
singularly
chaste
air
and
the
concert
going
on
therein
purified
in
its
ascent
from
the
depths
of
the
abyss
to
our
lofty
altitudes
reaches
us
confusedly
a
smothered
enchanted
enchanting
sound
then
it
diminishes
and
dies
away
into
silence
the
two
little
friends
return
to
their
seats
on
the
mats
and
once
more
take
up
their
melancholy
duet
an
orchestra
discreetly
subdued
but
innumerable
of
crickets
and
cicalas
accompanies
them
in
an
unceasing
tremolo
the
immense
tremolo
which
gentle
and
eternal
never
ceases
on
japanese
land
li
during
the
hour
of
siesta
the
abrupt
order
arrives
to
start
for
china
for
tchefou
a
horrid
place
in
the
gulf
of
pekin
it
is
yves
who
comes
to
wake
me
in
my
cabin
to
bring
me
the
news
i
must
positively
get
leave
to
go
on
shore
this
evening
he
says
while
i
endeavor
to
shake
myself
awake
if
it
is
only
to
help
you
to
dismantle
and
pack
up
there
he
gazes
through
my
raising
his
glance
towards
the
green
summits
in
the
direction
of
and
our
echoing
old
cottage
hidden
from
us
by
a
turn
of
the
mountain
it
is
very
nice
of
him
to
wish
to
help
me
in
my
packing
but
i
think
he
also
counts
upon
saying
farewell
to
his
little
japanese
friends
up
there
and
i
really
can
not
find
fault
with
that
he
gets
through
his
work
and
does
in
fact
get
leave
without
help
from
me
to
go
on
shore
at
five
after
drill
and
manœuvres
as
for
myself
i
start
off
at
once
in
a
hired
sampan
in
the
vast
flood
of
midday
sunshine
to
the
quivering
noise
of
the
cicalas
i
mount
up
to
the
paths
are
solitary
the
plants
drooping
in
the
heat
here
however
is
madame
jonquille
taking
the
air
in
the
bright
sunshine
of
the
grasshoppers
sheltering
her
dainty
figure
and
her
charming
face
under
an
immense
paper
parasol
a
huge
circle
closely
ribbed
and
fantastically
striped
she
recognizes
me
from
afar
and
laughing
as
usual
runs
to
meet
me
i
announce
our
departure
and
a
tearful
pout
suddenly
contracts
her
childish
face
after
all
does
this
news
grieve
her
is
she
going
to
shed
tears
over
it
no
it
turns
to
a
fit
of
laughter
a
little
nervous
perhaps
but
unexpected
and
disconcerting
dry
and
clear
pealing
through
the
silence
and
warmth
of
the
narrow
paths
like
a
cascade
of
little
mock
pearls
ah
there
indeed
is
a
marriage
tie
which
will
be
broken
without
much
pain
but
she
fills
me
with
impatience
poor
linnet
with
her
laughter
and
i
turn
my
back
upon
her
to
continue
my
journey
up
above
chrysanthème
sleeps
stretched
out
on
the
floor
the
house
is
wide
open
and
the
soft
mountain
breeze
rustles
gently
through
it
that
same
evening
we
had
intended
to
give
a
and
by
my
orders
flowers
had
already
been
placed
in
every
nook
and
corner
of
the
house
there
were
lotus
in
our
vases
beautiful
lotus
the
last
of
the
season
i
verily
believe
they
must
have
been
ordered
from
a
special
gardener
out
yonder
near
the
great
temple
and
they
will
cost
me
dear
with
a
few
gentle
taps
of
a
fan
i
awake
my
surprised
mousmé
and
curious
to
catch
her
first
impressions
i
announce
my
departure
she
starts
up
rubs
her
eyelids
with
the
back
of
her
little
hands
looks
at
me
and
hangs
her
head
something
like
an
expression
of
sadness
passes
in
her
eyes
this
little
sinking
at
the
heart
is
for
yves
no
doubt
the
news
spreads
through
the
house
mdlle
oyouki
dashes
upstairs
with
half
a
tear
in
each
of
her
babyish
eyes
kisses
me
with
her
full
red
lips
which
always
leave
a
wet
ring
on
my
cheek
then
quickly
draws
from
her
wide
sleeve
a
square
of
wipes
away
her
stealthy
tears
blows
her
little
nose
rolls
the
bit
of
paper
in
a
ball
and
throws
it
into
the
street
on
the
parasol
of
a
then
madame
prune
makes
her
appearance
in
an
agitated
and
discomposed
manner
she
successively
adopts
every
attitude
expressive
of
utter
dismay
what
on
earth
is
the
matter
with
the
old
lady
and
why
will
she
keep
getting
closer
and
closer
to
me
till
she
is
almost
in
my
way
it
is
wonderful
all
i
still
have
to
do
this
last
day
and
the
endless
drives
i
have
to
make
to
the
old
curiosity
shops
to
my
tradespeople
and
to
the
packers
nevertheless
before
my
rooms
are
dismantled
i
intend
making
a
sketch
of
them
as
i
did
formerly
at
stamboul
it
really
seems
to
me
as
if
all
i
do
here
is
a
bitter
parody
of
all
i
did
over
there
this
time
however
it
is
not
that
i
care
for
this
dwelling
it
is
only
because
it
is
pretty
and
uncommon
and
the
sketch
will
be
an
interesting
souvenir
i
fetch
therefore
a
leaf
out
of
my
album
and
begin
at
once
seated
on
the
floor
and
leaning
on
my
desk
ornamented
with
grasshoppers
in
relief
while
behind
me
very
very
close
to
me
the
three
women
follow
the
movements
of
my
pencil
with
an
astonished
attention
japanese
art
being
entirely
conventional
they
have
never
before
seen
anyone
draw
from
nature
and
my
style
delights
them
i
may
not
perhaps
possess
the
steady
and
nimble
touch
of
sucre
as
he
groups
his
charming
storks
but
i
am
master
of
a
few
notions
of
perspective
which
are
wanting
in
him
and
i
have
been
taught
to
draw
things
as
i
see
them
without
giving
them
ingeniously
distorted
and
grimacing
attitudes
and
the
three
japanese
are
amazed
at
the
air
of
thrown
in
my
sketch
with
little
shrieks
of
admiration
they
point
out
to
each
other
the
different
things
as
little
by
little
their
shape
and
form
are
outlined
in
black
on
my
paper
chrysanthème
gazes
at
me
with
a
new
kind
of
interest
she
says
literally
thou
first
meaning
you
are
really
quite
a
swell
mdlle
oyouki
is
carried
away
by
her
admiration
and
exclaims
in
a
burst
of
enthusiasm
anata
bakari
thou
alone
that
is
to
say
there
is
no
one
like
you
in
the
world
all
the
rest
are
mere
rubbish
madame
prune
says
nothing
but
i
can
see
that
she
does
not
think
the
less
her
languishing
attitudes
her
hand
that
at
each
moment
gently
touches
mine
confirm
the
suspicions
that
her
look
of
dismay
a
few
moments
ago
awoke
within
me
evidently
my
physical
charms
speak
to
her
imagination
which
in
spite
of
years
has
remained
full
of
romance
i
shall
leave
with
the
regret
of
having
understood
her
too
late
if
the
ladies
are
satisfied
with
my
sketch
i
am
far
from
being
so
i
have
put
everything
in
its
place
most
exactly
but
as
a
whole
it
has
an
ordinary
indifferent
french
look
which
does
not
suit
the
sentiment
is
not
given
and
i
almost
wonder
whether
i
should
not
have
done
better
in
falsifying
the
perspective
japanese
style
and
exaggerating
to
the
very
utmost
the
already
abnormal
outlines
of
what
i
see
before
me
and
then
the
pictured
dwelling
lacks
the
fragile
look
and
its
sonority
that
reminds
one
of
a
dry
violin
in
the
penciled
delineation
of
the
woodwork
the
minute
delicacy
with
which
it
is
wrought
is
wanting
neither
have
i
been
able
to
render
the
extreme
antiquity
the
perfect
cleanliness
nor
the
vibrating
song
of
the
cicalas
that
seems
to
have
been
stored
away
within
it
in
its
fibers
during
some
hundreds
of
summers
it
does
not
either
convey
the
impression
this
place
gives
of
being
in
a
suburb
perched
aloft
among
trees
above
the
drollest
of
towns
no
all
this
can
not
be
drawn
can
not
be
expressed
but
remains
undemonstrable
undefinable
having
sent
out
our
invitations
we
shall
in
spite
of
everything
give
our
this
evening
a
parting
tea
therefore
in
which
we
will
display
as
much
pomp
as
possible
it
is
moreover
rather
my
custom
to
wind
up
my
exotic
existences
with
a
fête
in
other
countries
i
have
done
the
same
besides
our
usual
set
we
shall
have
my
my
relatives
and
all
the
mousmés
of
the
neighborhood
but
by
an
extra
japanese
refinement
we
shall
not
admit
a
single
european
friend
not
even
the
one
yves
alone
shall
be
admitted
and
even
he
shall
be
hidden
away
in
a
corner
behind
some
flowers
and
works
of
art
in
the
last
glimmer
of
twilight
by
the
first
twinkling
star
the
ladies
with
many
charming
curtseys
make
their
appearance
our
house
is
soon
full
of
the
little
crouching
women
with
their
tiny
slit
eyes
vaguely
smiling
their
beautifully
dressed
hair
shining
like
polished
ebony
their
fragile
bodies
lost
in
the
many
folds
or
the
exaggerated
wide
garments
that
gape
as
if
ready
to
drop
from
their
little
tapering
backs
and
reveal
the
exquisite
napes
of
their
little
necks
chrysanthème
with
somewhat
a
melancholy
air
my
renoncule
with
many
affected
graces
busy
themselves
in
the
midst
of
the
different
groups
where
ere
long
the
miniature
pipes
are
lighted
soon
there
arises
a
murmuring
sound
of
discreet
laughter
expressing
nothing
but
having
a
pretty
exotic
ring
about
it
and
then
begins
a
harmony
of
pan
pan
sharp
rapid
taps
against
the
edges
of
the
finely
lacquered
pickled
and
spiced
fruits
are
handed
round
on
trays
of
quaint
and
varied
shapes
then
transparent
china
no
larger
than
half
an
make
their
appearance
and
the
ladies
are
offered
a
few
drops
of
sugarless
tea
poured
out
of
toy
kettles
or
a
sip
of
a
spirit
made
from
rice
which
it
is
the
custom
to
serve
hot
in
elegantly
shaped
vases
like
a
heron
throat
several
mousmés
execute
one
after
the
other
improvizations
on
the
others
sing
in
sharp
high
voices
hopping
about
continually
like
cicalas
in
delirium
madame
prune
no
longer
able
to
make
a
mystery
of
the
up
feelings
that
agitate
her
pays
me
the
most
marked
and
tender
attentions
and
begs
my
acceptance
of
a
quantity
of
little
souvenirs
an
image
a
little
vase
a
little
porcelain
goddess
of
the
moon
in
satsuma
ware
a
marvelously
grotesque
ivory
figure
i
tremblingly
follow
her
into
the
dark
corners
whither
she
calls
me
to
give
me
these
presents
in
a
at
about
nine
with
a
silken
rustling
arrive
the
three
guéchas
in
vogue
in
nagasaki
mdlles
pureté
orange
and
printemps
whom
i
have
hired
at
four
dollars
a
head
an
enormous
price
in
this
country
these
three
guéchas
are
indeed
the
very
same
little
creatures
i
heard
singing
on
the
rainy
day
of
my
arrival
through
the
thin
paneling
of
the
of
but
as
i
have
now
become
thoroughly
they
appear
to
me
more
diminutive
less
outlandish
and
in
no
way
mysterious
i
treat
them
rather
as
dancers
that
i
have
hired
and
the
idea
that
i
had
ever
thought
of
marrying
one
of
them
now
makes
me
shrug
my
shoulders
as
it
formerly
did
kangourou
the
excessive
heat
caused
by
the
respiration
of
the
mousmés
and
the
burning
lamps
brings
out
the
perfume
of
the
lotus
which
fills
the
atmosphere
and
the
scent
of
the
the
ladies
use
in
profusion
to
make
their
hair
glisten
is
also
strong
in
the
room
mdlle
orange
the
youngest
guécha
tiny
and
dainty
her
lips
outlined
with
gilt
paint
executes
some
delightful
steps
donning
the
most
extraordinary
wigs
and
masks
in
wood
or
cardboard
she
has
masks
imitating
old
noble
ladies
which
are
valuable
works
of
art
signed
by
artists
she
has
also
magnificent
long
robes
fashioned
in
the
old
style
and
trains
trimmed
at
the
bottom
with
thick
pads
in
order
to
give
to
the
movements
of
the
costume
something
rigid
and
unnatural
which
however
is
becoming
now
the
soft
balmy
breezes
blow
through
the
room
from
one
verandah
to
the
other
making
the
flames
of
the
lamps
flicker
they
scatter
the
lotus
flowers
faded
by
the
artificial
heat
which
falling
in
pieces
from
every
vase
sprinkle
the
guests
with
their
pollen
and
large
pink
petals
looking
like
bits
of
broken
glass
the
sensational
piece
reserved
for
the
end
is
a
trio
on
the
long
and
monotonous
that
the
guéchas
perform
as
a
rapid
on
the
highest
strings
very
sharply
struck
it
sounds
like
the
very
quintescence
the
paraphrase
the
exasperation
if
i
may
so
call
it
of
the
eternal
buzz
of
insects
which
issues
from
the
trees
old
roofs
old
walls
from
everything
in
fact
and
which
is
the
of
all
japanese
sounds
ten
the
program
has
been
carried
out
and
the
reception
is
over
a
last
general
pan
pan
the
little
pipes
are
stowed
away
into
their
chased
sheaths
tied
up
in
the
sashes
and
the
mousmés
rise
to
depart
they
light
at
the
end
of
short
sticks
a
quantity
of
red
gray
or
blue
lanterns
and
after
a
series
of
endless
bows
and
curtseys
the
guests
disperse
themselves
in
the
darkness
of
the
lanes
and
trees
we
also
go
down
to
the
town
yves
chrysanthème
oyouki
and
myself
in
order
to
conduct
my
and
youthful
aunt
madame
nénufar
to
their
house
we
want
to
take
one
last
stroll
together
in
our
old
familiar
pleasure
haunts
drink
one
more
iced
sherbet
at
the
house
of
the
buy
one
more
lantern
at
madame
and
eat
some
parting
waffles
at
madame
i
try
to
be
affected
moved
by
this
but
without
success
in
this
japan
as
with
the
little
men
and
women
who
inhabit
it
there
is
something
decidedly
wanting
pleasant
enough
as
a
mere
pastime
it
begets
no
feeling
of
attachment
on
our
return
when
i
am
once
more
with
yves
and
the
two
mousmés
climbing
up
the
road
to
which
i
shall
probably
never
see
again
a
vague
feeling
of
melancholy
pervades
my
last
stroll
it
is
however
but
the
melancholy
inseparable
from
all
things
that
are
about
to
end
without
possibility
of
return
moreover
this
calm
and
splendid
summer
is
also
drawing
to
a
close
for
us
since
we
shall
go
forth
to
meet
the
autumn
in
northern
china
i
am
beginning
alas
to
count
the
youthful
summers
i
may
still
hope
for
i
feel
more
gloomy
each
time
another
fades
away
and
flies
to
rejoin
the
others
already
disappeared
in
the
dark
and
bottomless
abyss
where
all
past
things
lie
buried
at
midnight
we
return
home
and
my
removal
begins
while
on
board
the
tall
kindly
takes
my
watch
it
is
a
nocturnal
rapid
stealthy
removal
thieves
fashion
remarks
yves
who
in
frequenting
the
mousmés
has
picked
up
a
smattering
of
the
niponese
language
messrs
the
packers
have
at
my
request
sent
in
the
evening
several
charming
little
boxes
with
compartments
and
false
bottoms
and
several
paper
bags
in
the
untearable
japanese
paper
which
close
of
themselves
and
are
fastened
by
strings
also
in
paper
arranged
beforehand
in
the
most
ingenious
manner
quite
the
cleverest
and
most
handy
thing
of
its
kind
for
little
useful
trifles
these
people
are
unrivaled
it
is
a
real
treat
to
pack
them
and
everybody
lends
a
helping
hand
yves
chrysanthème
madame
prune
her
daughter
and
sucre
by
the
glimmer
of
the
which
are
still
burning
every
one
wraps
rolls
and
ties
up
expeditiously
for
it
is
already
late
although
oyouki
has
a
heavy
heart
she
can
not
prevent
herself
from
indulging
in
a
few
bursts
of
childish
laughter
while
she
works
madame
prune
bathed
in
tears
no
longer
restrains
her
feelings
poor
lady
i
really
very
much
regret
chrysanthème
is
and
silent
but
what
a
fearful
amount
of
luggage
eighteen
cases
or
parcels
containing
buddhas
chimeras
and
vases
without
mentioning
the
last
lotus
that
i
carry
away
tied
up
in
a
pink
cluster
all
this
is
piled
up
in
the
djins
carts
hired
at
sunset
which
are
waiting
at
the
door
while
their
runners
lie
asleep
on
the
grass
a
starlit
and
exquisite
night
we
start
off
with
lighted
lanterns
followed
by
the
three
sorrowful
ladies
who
accompany
us
and
by
abrupt
slopes
dangerous
in
the
darkness
we
descend
towards
the
sea
the
djins
stiffening
their
muscular
legs
hold
back
with
all
their
might
the
heavily
loaded
little
cars
which
would
run
down
by
themselves
if
let
alone
and
that
so
rapidly
that
they
would
rush
into
empty
space
with
my
most
valuable
chattels
chrysanthème
walks
by
my
side
and
expresses
in
a
soft
and
winning
manner
her
regret
that
the
tall
did
not
offer
to
replace
me
for
the
whole
of
my
as
that
would
have
allowed
me
to
spend
this
last
night
even
till
morning
under
our
roof
listen
she
says
come
back
in
the
daytime
before
getting
under
way
to
bid
me
i
shall
only
return
to
my
mother
in
the
evening
you
will
find
me
still
up
there
and
i
promise
they
stop
at
a
certain
turn
from
whence
we
have
a
view
of
the
whole
roadstead
the
black
stagnant
waters
reflect
innumerable
distant
fires
and
the
ships
tiny
immovable
little
objects
which
seen
from
our
point
of
view
take
the
shape
of
fish
seem
also
to
slumber
little
objects
which
serve
to
bear
us
to
go
far
away
and
to
forget
the
three
ladies
are
going
to
turn
back
home
for
the
night
is
already
far
advanced
and
lower
down
the
cosmopolitan
quarters
near
the
quays
are
not
safe
at
this
unusual
hour
the
moment
has
therefore
come
for
yves
who
will
not
land
again
to
make
his
last
tragic
farewells
to
his
friends
the
little
mousmés
now
i
am
very
curious
to
see
the
parting
between
yves
and
chrysanthème
i
listen
with
all
my
ears
i
look
with
all
my
eyes
it
takes
place
in
the
simplest
and
quietest
fashion
none
of
that
heartbreaking
which
will
be
inevitable
between
madame
prune
and
myself
i
even
notice
in
my
mousmé
an
indifference
an
unconcern
which
puzzles
me
i
positively
am
at
a
loss
to
understand
what
it
all
means
and
i
muse
to
myself
as
i
continue
to
descend
towards
the
sea
her
appearance
of
sadness
was
not
therefore
on
yves
account
on
whose
then
and
the
phrase
runs
through
my
head
come
back
before
setting
sail
to
bid
me
i
shall
only
return
to
my
mother
in
the
evening
you
will
find
me
still
up
there
japan
is
indeed
most
delightful
this
evening
so
fresh
and
so
sweet
and
little
chrysanthème
was
very
charming
just
now
as
she
silently
walked
beside
me
through
the
darkness
of
the
lane
it
is
about
two
when
we
reach
the
in
a
hired
sampan
where
i
have
heaped
up
all
my
cases
till
there
is
danger
of
sinking
the
tall
gives
over
to
me
the
watch
that
i
must
keep
till
four
and
the
sailors
on
duty
but
half
awake
make
a
chain
in
the
darkness
to
haul
on
board
all
my
fragile
luggage
lii
i
had
planned
to
sleep
late
this
morning
in
order
to
make
up
for
my
lost
sleep
of
last
night
but
behold
at
eight
three
persons
of
the
most
singular
appearance
led
by
kangourou
present
themselves
with
endless
bows
at
the
door
of
my
cabin
they
are
dressed
in
long
robes
bedizened
with
dark
patterns
they
have
the
flowing
locks
high
foreheads
and
pallid
countenances
of
persons
too
exclusively
devoted
to
the
fine
arts
and
perched
on
the
top
of
their
chignons
they
wear
sailor
hats
of
english
shape
stuck
jauntily
on
one
side
under
their
arms
they
carry
portfolios
filled
with
sketches
in
their
hands
boxes
of
pencils
and
tied
together
like
fasces
a
bundle
of
fine
stylets
the
sharp
points
of
which
glitter
ostensibly
at
the
first
glance
even
in
the
bewilderment
of
waking
i
gather
from
their
appearance
what
their
errand
is
and
guessing
with
what
visitors
i
have
to
deal
i
say
come
in
messieurs
the
tattooers
these
are
the
specialists
most
in
renown
in
nagasaki
i
had
engaged
them
two
days
ago
not
knowing
that
we
were
about
to
leave
and
since
they
are
come
i
will
not
turn
them
away
my
friendly
and
intimate
relations
with
primitive
man
in
oceania
and
elsewhere
have
imbued
me
with
a
deplorable
taste
for
tattoo
work
and
i
had
wished
to
carry
away
on
me
as
a
curiosity
an
ornament
a
specimen
of
the
work
of
the
japanese
tattooers
who
have
a
delicacy
of
finish
which
is
unequaled
from
their
albums
spread
out
upon
my
table
i
make
my
choice
there
are
some
remarkably
odd
designs
amongst
them
appropriate
to
the
different
parts
of
the
human
body
emblems
for
the
arms
and
legs
sprays
of
roses
for
the
shoulders
great
grinning
faces
for
the
middle
of
the
back
there
are
even
to
suit
the
taste
of
their
clients
who
belong
to
foreign
navies
trophies
of
arms
american
and
french
flags
entwined
a
god
save
the
queen
amid
encircling
stars
and
figures
of
women
taken
from
grévin
sketches
in
the
my
choice
rests
upon
a
singular
blue
and
pink
dragon
a
couple
of
inches
long
which
will
have
a
fine
effect
upon
my
chest
on
the
side
opposite
the
heart
then
follows
an
hour
and
a
half
of
irritation
and
positive
pain
stretched
out
on
my
bunk
and
delivered
over
to
the
tender
mercies
of
these
personages
i
stiffen
myself
and
submit
to
the
million
imperceptible
pricks
they
inflict
when
by
chance
a
little
blood
flows
confusing
the
outline
by
a
stream
of
red
one
of
the
artists
hastens
to
staunch
it
with
his
lips
and
i
make
no
objections
knowing
that
this
is
the
japanese
manner
the
method
used
by
their
doctors
for
the
wounds
of
both
man
and
beast
a
piece
of
work
as
minute
and
fine
as
that
of
an
engraver
upon
stone
is
slowly
executed
on
my
person
and
their
lean
hands
harrow
and
worry
me
with
automatic
precision
at
length
it
is
finished
and
the
tattooers
falling
back
with
an
air
of
satisfaction
to
contemplate
their
work
declare
it
will
be
lovely
i
dress
myself
quickly
to
go
on
shore
and
take
advantage
of
my
last
hours
in
japan
the
heat
is
fearful
the
powerful
september
sun
falls
with
a
certain
melancholy
upon
the
yellowing
leaves
it
is
a
day
of
clear
burning
heat
after
an
almost
chilly
morning
like
yesterday
it
is
during
the
drowsy
noon
that
i
ascend
to
my
lofty
suburb
by
deserted
pathways
filled
only
with
light
and
silence
i
noiselessly
open
the
door
of
my
dwelling
and
enter
cautiously
on
tiptoe
for
fear
of
madame
prune
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
upon
the
white
mats
by
the
side
of
the
little
clogs
and
little
sandals
which
are
always
lying
about
the
vestibule
there
is
a
great
array
of
luggage
ready
for
departure
which
i
recognize
at
a
glance
pretty
dresses
familiar
to
my
sight
carefully
folded
and
wrapped
in
blue
towels
tied
at
the
four
corners
i
even
fancy
i
feel
a
little
sad
when
i
catch
sight
of
a
corner
of
the
famous
box
of
letters
and
souvenirs
peeping
out
of
one
of
these
bundles
in
which
ray
portrait
by
uyeno
now
reposes
among
divers
photographs
of
mousmés
a
sort
of
mandolin
also
ready
for
departure
lies
on
the
top
of
the
pile
in
its
case
of
figured
silk
it
resembles
the
flitting
of
some
gypsy
or
rather
it
reminds
me
of
an
engraving
in
a
book
of
fables
i
owned
in
my
childhood
the
whole
thing
is
exactly
like
the
slender
wardrobe
and
the
long
guitar
which
the
cicala
who
had
sung
all
the
summer
carried
upon
her
back
when
she
knocked
at
the
door
of
her
neighbor
the
ant
poor
little
gypsy
i
mount
the
stairs
on
tiptoe
and
stop
at
the
sound
of
singing
that
i
hear
up
in
my
room
it
is
undoubtedly
chrysanthème
voice
and
the
song
is
a
cheerful
one
this
chills
me
and
changes
the
current
of
my
thoughts
i
am
almost
sorry
i
have
taken
the
trouble
to
come
mingled
with
the
song
is
a
noise
i
can
not
understand
dzinn
a
clear
metallic
ring
as
of
coins
being
flung
vigorously
on
the
floor
i
am
well
aware
that
this
vibrating
house
exaggerates
every
sound
during
the
silence
of
night
but
all
the
same
i
am
puzzled
to
know
what
my
mousmé
can
be
doing
dzinn
is
she
amusing
herself
with
quoits
or
the
du
or
pitch
and
toss
nothing
of
the
kind
i
fancy
i
have
guessed
and
i
continue
my
upward
progress
still
more
gently
on
all
fours
with
the
precautions
of
a
red
indian
to
give
myself
for
the
last
time
the
pleasure
of
surprising
her
she
has
not
heard
me
come
in
in
our
great
white
room
emptied
and
swept
out
where
the
clear
sunshine
pours
in
and
the
soft
wind
and
the
yellowed
leaves
of
the
garden
she
is
sitting
all
alone
her
back
turned
to
the
door
she
is
dressed
for
walking
ready
to
go
to
her
mother
her
parasol
beside
her
on
the
floor
are
spread
out
all
the
fine
silver
dollars
which
according
to
our
agreement
i
had
given
her
the
evening
before
with
the
competent
dexterity
of
an
old
she
fingers
them
turns
them
over
throws
them
on
the
floor
and
armed
with
a
little
mallet
hoc
rings
them
vigorously
against
her
ear
singing
the
while
i
know
not
what
little
pensive
song
which
i
daresay
she
improvises
as
she
goes
along
well
after
all
it
is
even
more
completely
japanese
than
i
could
possibly
have
imagined
it
this
last
scene
of
my
married
life
i
feel
inclined
to
laugh
how
simple
i
have
been
to
allow
myself
to
be
taken
in
by
the
few
clever
words
she
whispered
yesterday
as
she
walked
beside
me
by
a
tolerably
pretty
little
phrase
embellished
as
it
was
by
the
silence
of
two
in
the
morning
and
all
the
wonderful
enchantments
of
night
ah
not
more
for
yves
than
for
me
not
more
for
me
than
for
yves
has
any
feeling
passed
through
that
little
brain
that
little
heart
when
i
have
looked
at
her
long
enough
i
call
hi
chrysanthème
she
turns
confused
and
reddening
even
to
her
ears
at
having
been
caught
at
this
work
she
is
quite
wrong
however
to
be
so
much
troubled
for
i
am
on
the
contrary
delighted
the
fear
that
i
might
be
leaving
her
in
some
sadness
had
almost
given
me
a
pang
and
i
infinitely
prefer
that
this
marriage
should
end
as
it
had
begun
in
a
joke
that
is
a
good
idea
of
yours
i
say
a
precaution
which
should
always
be
taken
in
this
country
of
yours
where
so
many
people
are
clever
in
forging
money
make
haste
and
get
through
it
before
i
start
and
if
any
false
pieces
have
found
their
way
into
the
number
i
will
willingly
replace
them
however
she
refuses
to
continue
before
me
and
i
expected
as
much
to
do
so
would
have
been
contrary
to
all
her
notions
of
politeness
hereditary
and
acquired
all
her
conventionality
all
her
with
a
disdainful
little
foot
clothed
as
usual
in
exquisite
socks
with
a
special
hood
for
the
great
toe
she
pushes
away
the
piles
of
white
dollars
and
scatters
them
on
the
mats
we
have
hired
a
large
covered
sampan
she
says
to
change
the
conversation
and
we
are
all
going
together
campanule
jonquille
touki
all
your
mousmés
to
watch
your
vessel
set
sail
pray
sit
down
and
stay
a
few
minutes
no
i
really
can
not
stay
i
have
several
things
to
do
in
the
town
see
and
the
order
was
given
for
every
one
to
be
on
board
by
three
in
time
for
muster
before
starting
moreover
i
would
rather
escape
as
you
can
imagine
while
madame
prune
is
still
enjoying
her
siesta
i
should
be
afraid
of
being
drawn
into
some
corner
or
of
provoking
some
heartrending
parting
scene
chrysanthème
bows
her
head
and
says
no
more
but
seeing
that
i
am
really
going
rises
to
escort
me
without
speaking
without
the
slightest
noise
she
follows
me
as
we
descend
the
staircase
and
cross
the
garden
full
of
sunshine
where
the
dwarf
shrubs
and
the
deformed
flowers
seem
like
the
rest
of
the
household
plunged
in
warm
somnolence
at
the
outer
gate
i
stop
for
the
last
adieu
the
little
sad
pout
has
reappeared
more
accentuated
than
ever
on
chrysanthème
face
it
is
the
right
thing
it
is
correct
and
i
should
feel
offended
now
were
it
absent
well
little
mousmé
let
us
part
good
friends
one
last
kiss
even
if
you
like
i
took
you
to
amuse
me
you
have
not
perhaps
succeeded
very
well
but
after
all
you
have
done
what
you
could
given
me
your
little
face
your
little
curtseys
your
little
music
in
short
you
have
been
pleasant
enough
in
your
japanese
way
and
who
knows
perchance
i
may
yet
think
of
you
sometimes
when
i
recall
this
glorious
summer
these
pretty
quaint
gardens
and
the
ceaseless
concert
of
the
cicales
she
prostrates
herself
on
the
threshold
of
the
door
her
forehead
against
the
ground
and
remains
in
this
attitude
of
superlatively
polite
salute
as
long
as
i
am
in
sight
while
i
go
down
the
pathway
by
which
i
am
to
disappear
for
ever
as
the
distance
between
us
increases
i
turn
once
or
twice
to
look
at
her
again
but
it
is
a
mere
civility
and
meant
to
return
as
it
deserves
her
grand
final
salutation
liii
on
entering
the
town
at
the
turn
of
the
principal
street
i
have
the
good
luck
to
meet
no
my
poor
relation
i
was
just
at
that
moment
in
want
of
a
speedy
djin
and
i
at
once
get
into
his
vehicle
besides
it
will
be
an
alleviation
to
my
feelings
in
this
hour
of
departure
to
take
my
last
drive
in
company
with
a
member
of
my
family
unaccustomed
as
i
was
to
be
out
of
doors
during
the
hours
of
siesta
i
had
never
yet
seen
the
streets
of
the
town
thus
overwhelmed
by
the
sunshine
thus
deserted
in
the
silence
and
solitary
brilliancy
peculiar
to
all
hot
countries
in
front
of
all
the
shops
hang
white
shades
adorned
here
and
there
with
slight
designs
in
black
in
the
quaintness
of
which
lurks
i
know
not
what
something
mysterious
dragons
emblems
symbolical
figures
the
sky
is
too
glaring
the
light
crude
implacable
never
has
this
old
town
of
nagasaki
appeared
to
me
so
old
so
so
bald
notwithstanding
all
its
veneer
of
new
papers
and
gaudy
paintings
these
little
wooden
houses
of
such
marvelous
cleanly
whiteness
inside
are
black
outside
disjointed
and
when
one
looks
closely
this
grimace
is
to
be
found
everywhere
in
the
hideous
masks
laughing
in
the
shop
fronts
of
the
innumerable
in
the
grotesque
figures
the
playthings
the
idols
cruel
suspicious
mad
it
is
even
found
in
the
buildings
in
the
friezes
of
the
religious
porticos
in
the
roofs
of
the
thousand
pagodas
of
which
the
angles
and
writhe
and
twist
like
the
yet
dangerous
remains
of
ancient
and
malignant
beasts
and
the
disturbing
intensity
of
expression
reigning
over
inanimate
nature
contrasts
with
the
almost
absolute
blank
of
the
human
countenance
with
the
smiling
foolishness
of
the
simple
little
folk
who
meet
one
gaze
as
they
patiently
carry
on
their
minute
trades
in
the
gloom
of
their
tiny
houses
workmen
squatted
on
their
heels
carving
with
their
imperceptible
tools
the
droll
or
odiously
obscene
ivory
ornaments
marvelous
cabinet
curiosities
which
have
made
japan
so
famous
with
the
european
amateurs
who
have
never
seen
it
unconscious
artists
tracing
with
steady
hand
on
a
background
of
lacquer
or
of
porcelain
traditional
designs
learnt
by
heart
or
transmitted
to
their
brains
by
a
process
of
heredity
through
thousands
of
years
automatic
painters
whose
storks
are
similar
to
those
of
sucre
with
the
inevitable
little
rocks
or
little
butterflies
eternally
the
same
the
least
of
these
illuminators
with
his
insignificant
eyeless
face
possesses
at
his
fingers
ends
the
maximum
of
dexterity
in
this
art
of
decoration
light
and
wittily
incongruous
which
threatens
to
invade
us
in
france
in
this
epoch
of
imitative
decadence
and
which
has
become
the
great
resource
of
our
manufacturers
of
cheap
of
is
it
because
i
am
about
to
leave
this
country
because
i
have
no
longer
any
link
to
bind
me
to
it
any
on
its
soil
and
that
my
spirit
is
already
on
the
wing
i
know
not
but
it
seems
to
me
i
have
never
as
clearly
seen
and
comprehended
it
as
and
more
even
than
ever
do
i
find
it
little
aged
with
blood
and
sap
i
feel
more
fully
its
antediluvian
antiquity
its
centuries
of
mummification
which
will
soon
degenerate
into
hopeless
and
grotesque
buffoonery
as
it
comes
into
contact
with
western
novelties
it
is
getting
late
little
by
little
the
siestas
are
everywhere
coming
to
an
end
the
queer
little
streets
brighten
up
and
begin
to
swarm
in
the
sunshine
with
parasols
now
begins
the
procession
of
uglinesses
of
the
most
impossible
description
a
procession
of
grotesque
figures
capped
with
or
sailors
business
transactions
begin
again
and
the
struggle
for
existence
close
and
bitter
here
as
in
one
of
our
own
artisan
quarters
but
meaner
and
smaller
at
the
moment
of
my
departure
i
can
only
find
within
myself
a
smile
of
careless
mockery
for
the
swarming
crowd
of
this
liliputian
curtseying
people
laborious
industrious
greedy
of
gain
tainted
with
a
constitutional
affectation
hereditary
insignificance
and
incurable
monkeyishness
poor
cousin
how
right
i
was
to
have
held
him
in
good
esteem
he
is
by
far
the
best
and
most
disinterested
of
my
japanese
family
when
all
my
commissions
are
finished
he
puts
up
his
little
vehicle
under
a
tree
and
much
touched
by
my
departure
insists
upon
escorting
me
on
board
the
to
watch
over
my
final
purchases
in
the
sampan
which
conveys
me
to
the
ship
and
to
see
them
himself
safely
into
my
cabin
his
indeed
is
the
only
hand
i
clasp
with
a
really
friendly
feeling
without
a
suppressed
smile
on
quitting
this
japan
no
doubt
in
this
country
as
in
many
others
there
is
more
honest
friendship
and
less
ugliness
among
the
simple
beings
devoted
to
purely
physical
work
at
five
in
the
afternoon
we
set
sail
along
the
line
of
the
shore
are
two
or
three
sampans
in
them
the
mousmés
shut
up
in
the
narrow
cabins
peep
at
us
through
the
tiny
windows
half
hiding
their
faces
on
account
of
the
sailors
these
are
our
wives
who
have
wished
out
of
politeness
to
look
upon
us
once
more
there
are
other
sampans
as
well
in
which
other
japanese
women
are
also
watching
our
departure
these
stand
upright
under
great
parasols
decorated
with
big
black
letters
and
daubed
over
with
clouds
of
varied
and
startling
colors
liv
we
move
slowly
out
of
the
great
green
bay
the
groups
of
women
become
lost
in
the
distance
the
country
of
round
and
umbrellas
fades
gradually
from
our
sight
now
the
great
sea
opens
before
us
immense
colorless
solitary
a
solemn
repose
after
so
much
that
was
too
ingenious
and
too
small
the
wooded
mountains
the
charming
capes
disappear
and
japan
remains
faithful
to
itself
in
its
last
picturesque
rocks
its
quaint
islands
on
which
the
trees
tastefully
arrange
themselves
in
groups

cabin

evening
in

sea
my
eyes
chance
to
fall
upon
the
lotus
brought
from
they
had
lasted
for
two
or
three
days
but
now
they
have
faded
and
pitifully
strew
my
carpet
with
their
pale
pink
petals
i
who
have
carefully
preserved
so
many
faded
flowers
fallen
alas
into
dust

so
many
that
the
collection
is
now
almost

ridiculous
and
incoherent

try
hard
but
without
success
to
get
up
a
sentiment
for
these
lotus
and
yet
they
are
the
last
living
souvenirs
of
my
summer
at
nagasaki
i
pick
them
up
however
with
a
certain
amount
of
consideration
and
i
open
my
from
the
gray
misty

a
livid
light

upon

wan
and
gloomy
kind
of
twilight

down
yellowish
upon
this
yellow
sea
we
feel
that
we
are
moving
northwards
that
autumn
is
approaching
i
throw
the
poor
lotus
into
the
boundless
waste
of
waters
making
them
my
best
