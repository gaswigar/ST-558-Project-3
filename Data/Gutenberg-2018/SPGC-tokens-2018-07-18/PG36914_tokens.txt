part
i
a
son
of
the
sahara
chapter
i
in
the
days
when
france
was
pursuing
a
vigorous
forward
policy
in
africa
a
policy
started
by
general
faidherbe
and
carried
on
by
subsequent
governors
one
of
the
bravest
among
her
pioneer
soldiers
was
colonel
raoul
le
breton
he
was
a
big
handsome
man
with
a
swarthy
complexion
hair
and
dark
fiery
eyes
by
nature
impetuous
and
reckless
with
a
trio
of
white
sergeants
and
a
hundred
senegalese
soldiers
he
would
attempt
and
accomplish
things
that
no
man
with
ten
times
his
following
would
have
attempted
but
there
came
a
day
when
even
his
luck
failed
he
left
louis
in
senegal
and
went
upwards
to
the
intending
to
pierce
the
heart
of
the
sahara
from
that
expedition
however
he
never
returned
the
government
at
louis
assumed
that
he
and
his
little
pioneer
force
had
been
wiped
out
by
some
hostile
negro
king
or
arab
chief
it
was
but
one
of
the
tragedies
attached
to
extending
a
nation
territory
when
raoul
le
breton
went
on
that
expedition
he
did
what
no
man
should
have
done
who
attempts
to
explore
the
back
of
beyond
with
an
indifferent
force
he
took
his
wife
with
him
there
was
some
excuse
for
this
piece
of
folly
he
was
newly
married
he
adored
his
wife
and
she
worshipped
him
and
refused
to
let
him
go
unless
she
went
also
she
was
barely
half
his
age
a
girl
just
fresh
from
a
convent
school
whom
he
had
met
and
married
in
paris
during
his
last
leave
colonel
le
breton
journeyed
for
weeks
through
an
arid
country
an
almost
trackless
expanse
of
poor
grass
and
stunted
scrub
until
he
reached
the
edge
of
the
sahara
annette
le
breton
enjoyed
her
travels
she
did
not
mind
the
life
in
tents
the
rough
jolting
of
her
camel
the
poor
food
the
heat
the
flies
she
minded
nothing
so
long
as
she
was
with
her
husband
he
was
a
man
of
rare
fascination
as
many
women
had
found
to
their
cost
a
light
lover
until
annette
had
come
into
his
life
and
captured
his
straying
heart
once
and
for
all
on
the
edge
of
the
sahara
le
breton
met
a
man
who
on
the
surface
at
least
appeared
to
see
even
more
quickly
than
the
majority
of
negro
kings
and
arab
chiefs
he
had
come
in
contact
with
the
advantages
attached
to
being
under
the
shadow
of
the
french
flag
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
where
the
sultan
casim
ammeh
came
from
he
appeared
one
afternoon
riding
like
a
madman
out
of
the
blazing
distance
a
picturesque
figure
in
his
flowing
white
burnoose
sitting
his
black
stallion
like
a
centaur
he
was
a
young
man
perhaps
about
of
medium
height
lean
and
lithe
and
brown
with
fierce
black
eyes
and
a
cruel
mouth
the
hereditary
ruler
of
that
portion
of
the
sahara
his
capital
was
a
walled
city
that
so
far
had
not
been
visited
by
any
european
in
his
way
he
was
a
man
of
great
wealth
and
he
added
to
that
wealth
by
frequent
marauding
expeditions
and
with
a
slight
smile
he
listened
to
all
the
frenchman
had
to
say
already
he
had
heard
of
france
a
great
power
creeping
slowly
onwards
and
he
wondered
whether
he
was
strong
enough
to
oppose
it
or
whether
the
wiser
plan
might
not
be
just
to
rest
secure
under
the
shadow
of
its
distant
wing
and
under
its
protection
continue
his
wild
marauding
life
as
usual
as
he
sat
with
colonel
le
breton
in
the
latter
tent
something
happened
which
caused
the
sultan
casim
ammeh
to
make
up
his
mind
very
quickly
it
was
late
afternoon
from
the
open
flap
of
the
tent
an
endless
rolling
expense
of
sand
showed
with
here
and
there
a
knot
of
coarse
twisted
grass
a
dwarfed
shrub
or
a
flare
of
distorted
cacti
the
french
officer
camp
was
pitched
by
an
oasis
a
little
group
of
date
palms
where
a
spring
bubbled
among
brown
rocks
bringing
an
abundance
of
grass
and
herbs
where
horses
and
camels
browsed
as
the
two
men
sat
talking
a
soft
voice
said
unexpectedly
oh
raoul
i
no
idea
you
had
a
visitor
all
at
once
a
girl
had
appeared
in
the
entrance
of
the
tent
she
was
small
and
slim
with
two
thick
plaits
of
hair
reaching
to
her
knees
a
beautiful
girl
of
about
eighteen
with
wide
grey
eyes
and
a
creamy
white
skin
her
voice
brought
le
breton
to
his
feet
what
is
it
annette
he
asked
i
thought
i
come
later
she
said
the
blushes
mounting
to
her
cheeks
the
sultan
casim
ammeh
got
to
his
feet
also
not
out
of
any
sense
of
deference
he
had
none
where
women
were
concerned
but
drawn
there
by
the
beauty
of
the
girl
you
need
mind
what
you
say
in
front
of
this
man
her
husband
remarked
he
does
understand
a
word
of
french
ill
tell
you
later
raoul
when
there
nobody
here
she
would
have
gone
but
le
breton
called
her
forward
and
in
arabic
introduced
her
to
his
visitor
annette
bowed
to
the
lean
lithe
brown
man
in
the
white
burnoose
and
her
eyes
dropped
under
the
fierce
admiration
in
his
the
sultan
looked
at
her
all
the
time
wondering
why
the
white
man
was
such
a
fool
as
to
let
this
priceless
pearl
this
jewel
among
women
go
unveiled
and
allow
the
eyes
of
strange
men
to
rest
upon
her
with
desire
and
longing
annette
said
she
was
pleased
to
meet
him
a
message
her
husband
translated
and
which
brought
a
fierce
smile
to
the
young
sultan
face
and
made
the
wild
desire
in
his
savage
heart
suddenly
blossom
into
plans
so
she
this
houri
from
paradise
was
pleased
to
meet
him
this
fair
flower
from
a
far
land
but
not
so
pleased
as
he
was
to
meet
and
her
husband
let
her
say
such
things
to
strange
men
what
a
fool
the
man
was
not
worthy
of
this
houri
he
could
not
appreciate
the
treasure
he
possessed
not
as
he
the
sultan
would
were
she
his
casim
ammeh
despised
colonel
le
breton
utterly
as
soon
as
the
introduction
was
over
annette
would
have
gone
do
run
away
my
pet
her
husband
said
fondly
i
shall
soon
have
finished
but
the
girl
went
anxious
to
get
away
from
the
arab
chief
who
watched
her
with
such
covetous
desire
and
smouldering
passion
in
his
fierce
black
eyes
when
she
had
gone
the
two
men
seated
themselves
again
but
the
sultan
gave
no
thought
to
the
business
in
hand
he
only
wanted
one
thing
now
the
girl
who
had
just
gone
from
the
tent
soon
after
annette
departure
he
left
promising
to
visit
le
breton
again
within
the
course
of
a
few
days
he
kept
his
word
five
days
later
he
swept
out
of
the
desert
with
a
horde
of
wild
horsemen
and
in
less
than
half
an
hour
there
was
only
one
of
raoul
le
breton
expedition
left
alive
the
next
day
with
annette
limp
across
his
saddle
the
sultan
casim
ammeh
set
off
with
his
following
to
his
desert
stronghold

annette
le
breton
remembered
nothing
of
her
journey
to
her
life
was
a
nightmare
of
horror
that
held
nothing
but
her
murderer
whom
she
could
not
escape
from
she
was
taken
to
the
palace
and
placed
in
the
apartment
reserved
for
the
sultan
favourite
a
big
room
with
walls
and
floor
of
gold
mosaic
furnished
with
ottomans
rugs
and
cushions
and
little
tables
and
stools
of
carved
sandalwood
inlaid
with
ivory
and
silver
on
one
side
of
the
apartment
a
series
of
archways
opened
on
a
screened
and
fretted
gallery
at
the
end
of
which
a
flight
of
wide
shallow
steps
led
down
into
a
walled
garden
a
dream
of
roses
but
it
was
weeks
before
annette
knew
anything
of
this
all
day
long
she
lay
broken
and
suffering
on
one
of
the
ottomans
and
women
fawned
upon
her
saying
words
she
could
not
understand
women
who
looked
at
her
queerly
jealously
and
talked
about
her
among
themselves
a
strange
girl
this
new
fancy
of
the
sultan
who
wanted
none
of
the
things
he
piled
upon
her
not
even
his
love
a
girl
who
looked
as
though
life
were
a
mirage
as
if
she
moved
in
bad
dreams
a
listless
girl
beautiful
beyond
any
yet
seen
in
the
harem
who
seemed
to
have
neither
idea
nor
appreciation
of
the
honour
that
was
hers
who
lay
all
day
in
silence
her
only
language
tears
tears
that
even
the
sultan
could
not
charm
away
in
fact
they
seemed
to
fall
more
quickly
and
hopelessly
when
he
came
to
see
her
yet
he
did
everything
that
mortal
man
could
do
to
comfort
her
jewels
were
showered
upon
her
jewels
she
refused
to
wear
to
look
at
even
casting
them
from
her
with
weak
angry
hands
when
her
women
would
have
decked
her
with
them
for
her
master
coming
and
never
before
were
so
many
musicians
singers
dancers
and
conjurors
sent
to
the
women
apartments
hardly
a
day
passed
without
bringing
some
such
form
of
diversion
or
merchants
with
rare
silks
perfumes
and
ostrich
feathers
the
harem
had
never
had
such
a
perpetual
round
of
amusements
all
for
this
new
and
she
refused
to
be
either
amused
or
interested
she
would
look
neither
at
the
goods
nor
the
entertainers
she
just
stayed
with
her
face
turned
towards
the
wall
and
wept
one
day
when
the
sultan
came
to
the
harem
to
visit
his
new
favourite
some
of
the
older
women
drew
him
aside
and
whispered
with
him
they
suspected
they
had
found
a
reason
for
the
girl
strange
behaviour
their
words
sent
the
sultan
from
the
big
hall
of
the
harem
to
the
gilded
chamber
set
aside
for
annette
with
hope
in
his
savage
heart
and
left
him
looking
down
at
her
with
a
touch
of
tenderness
on
his
cruel
face
he
laid
a
dark
hand
on
the
girl
caressing
her
fondly
give
me
a
son
my
pearl
he
whispered
then
my
cup
will
be
full
indeed
annette
shuddered
at
his
touch
she
had
no
idea
what
he
said
he
and
his
language
were
beyond
her
as
the
long
weeks
ground
out
their
slow
and
dreary
course
annette
grew
to
suspect
what
her
attendants
now
knew
the
weeks
became
months
and
annette
languished
in
her
captor
palace
her
only
respite
the
times
he
was
away
on
some
marauding
expedition
he
loved
rapine
and
murder
and
was
never
happy
unless
dabbling
in
blood
sometimes
he
was
away
for
weeks
together
killing
and
stealing
bringing
slaves
for
the
of
his
city
and
fresh
women
for
his
harem
during
one
of
his
absences
annette
baby
arrived
the
child
came
a
week
or
so
before
the
women
had
expected
it
the
girl
has
wept
so
much
they
said
that
her
son
has
come
before
his
time
to
see
what
his
mother
tears
are
about
and
now
if
allah
is
kind
let
us
hope
the
child
will
dry
them
for
a
fortnight
annette
was
too
ill
to
know
even
that
she
had
a
son
when
the
baby
was
brought
to
her
she
hardly
dared
look
at
it
not
knowing
what
horror
might
have
come
from
those
ghastly
nights
spent
with
the
sultan
casim
ammeh
but
when
she
looked
it
was
not
his
face
dark
and
cruel
that
looked
back
at
her
in
miniature
she
saw
the
face
of
raoul
le
breton
this
son
of
hers
did
not
owe
his
life
to
the
sultan
he
was
a
legacy
from
her
murdered
husband
something
that
belonged
to
her
lost
life
with
a
wild
sob
of
joy
annette
held
out
weak
arms
for
her
baby
weeping
she
strained
the
mite
to
her
breast
baptizing
it
with
her
tears
tears
of
happiness
this
time
light
and
love
had
come
into
her
life
again
for
raoul
was
not
dead
he
had
come
back
to
her
weak
and
tiny
he
lay
upon
her
heart
hers
to
love
and
cherish
she
was
lying
on
her
couch
one
day
too
absorbed
in
tracing
out
each
one
of
her
dead
lover
features
in
the
tiny
face
pillowed
on
her
breast
to
notice
what
was
happening
when
the
voice
she
dreaded
said
in
a
fierce
fond
manner
so
pearl
of
my
heart
you
love
my
son
even
if
you
hate
me
annette
did
not
know
what
the
sultan
said
but
she
held
her
child
closer
watching
its
father
murderer
with
fear
and
loathing
afraid
that
he
might
put
his
dark
defiling
hands
upon
her
treasure
but
he
did
not
attempt
to
touch
either
her
or
the
child
seating
himself
at
her
side
he
stayed
watching
her
tenderness
on
his
cruel
face
for
the
first
time
having
pity
on
her
weakness
the
weakness
of
the
woman
who
had
given
him
the
one
thing
his
savage
heart
craved
for
and
which
until
now
had
been
denied
him
a
son
chapter
iii
by
the
time
annette
knew
enough
arabic
to
make
herself
understood
and
to
understand
what
was
said
around
her
she
realized
that
if
the
sultan
learnt
her
boy
was
not
his
this
one
joy
of
her
tragic
life
would
be
taken
from
her
he
would
murder
the
son
as
he
had
murdered
the
father
as
the
baby
grew
her
one
idea
was
to
keep
its
true
parentage
from
her
savage
captor
if
she
could
have
done
so
she
would
have
kept
his
dark
hands
from
touching
her
son
but
this
was
impossible
when
in
the
sultan
came
every
day
to
see
the
child
often
sitting
with
it
in
his
arms
watching
it
with
an
air
of
proud
possession
and
fearsomely
annette
would
watch
him
wondering
why
he
never
suspected
but
he
was
too
eaten
up
with
his
own
desire
for
a
son
ever
to
give
a
thought
to
her
dead
husband
the
baby
was
given
the
name
of
casim
ammeh
but
annette
always
called
her
boy
by
another
name
raoul
le
breton
and
at
the
age
of
five
he
said
to
her
why
do
you
always
call
me
not
as
my
father
does
his
father
annette
heart
ached
his
father
had
been
dead
these
long
years
murdered
by
the
man
her
son
now
called
by
that
name
the
sultan
and
myself
are
of
different
races
she
said
he
calls
you
by
his
name
i
by
one
of
my
own
choosing
raoul
le
breton
why
do
you
always
say
sultan
and
never
father
sadly
she
smiled
at
her
small
questioner
some
day
my
son
i
tell
you
when
you
are
a
man
and
understand
things
at
five
raoul
le
breton
was
a
big
handsome
boy
spoilt
and
pampered
by
the
whole
harem
and
spoilt
most
of
all
by
the
man
he
proudly
called
father
the
sultan
in
his
flowing
white
robes
with
his
horses
his
horde
of
wild
followers
and
barbaric
splendour
was
a
picturesque
figure
one
to
capture
any
brave
boy
heart
annette
did
all
she
could
to
counteract
her
captor
influence
but
as
the
child
grew
he
was
more
with
the
sultan
than
with
her
what
was
more
he
craved
for
men
company
he
soon
tired
of
the
amusements
the
harem
could
offer
he
much
preferred
to
be
on
his
own
horse
galloping
with
the
sultan
or
some
of
his
men
along
the
desert
tracks
about
the
city
and
knowing
annette
loved
her
son
and
hated
him
despite
their
years
together
the
sultan
did
all
he
could
to
win
the
boy
affection
and
wean
him
from
his
mother
he
might
have
succeeded
except
for
one
thing
the
boy
loved
learning
and
to
hear
of
the
great
world
that
his
mother
came
from
a
world
that
seemed
as
remote
from
as
the
paradise
his
moslem
teachers
spoke
of
the
sultan
was
not
averse
to
the
mother
teaching
her
son
he
was
a
shrewd
man
if
savage
and
cruel
and
that
france
from
where
the
girl
came
was
growing
ever
more
powerful
it
would
be
to
the
advantage
to
learn
all
the
arts
and
cunning
of
his
mother
people
the
sultan
casim
gave
annette
but
one
present
that
she
took
from
him
willingly
a
sandalwood
bureau
with
shelves
and
drawers
and
little
sliding
panels
an
elaborately
carved
and
handsome
piece
of
furniture
stocked
with
slate
and
pencil
paper
quills
and
ink
such
as
the
priests
at
the
mosques
used
themselves
for
this
strange
girl
who
hated
him
had
more
learning
than
all
the
priests
put
together
but
for
all
that
the
youngster
had
to
sit
at
their
feet
at
appointed
times
and
be
taught
all
the
sultan
had
ever
been
taught
to
read
and
write
and
recite
scraps
from
the
koran
and
to
be
a
true
moslem
annette
hated
this
wild
profligate
religion
and
into
her
son
she
tried
to
instil
her
own
roman
catholic
faith
but
at
eight
years
although
he
learnt
with
avidity
all
her
other
teachings
he
laughed
at
her
religion
yours
is
a
woman
religion
little
mother
he
said
one
day
all
right
for
you
a
religion
that
prays
to
a
woman
but
it
is
not
suitable
for
men
give
me
my
father
religion
a
religion
where
men
rule
in
that
one
does
not
bow
the
knee
to
a
woman
a
good
religion
my
father
fierce
and
strong
of
love
and
fighting
not
a
puling
thing
where
one
prays
to
a
woman
and
a
babe
no
little
mother
keep
your
religion
and
be
happy
with
it
i
prefer
my
father
and
my
own
raoul
my
son
you
must
forget
the
white
side
when
you
are
with
the
sultan
she
said
gently
a
touch
of
chiding
in
her
sad
voice
the
boy
looked
at
her
speculatively
knowing
already
that
his
mother
had
no
affection
for
the
man
he
called
father
you
should
be
proud
not
sorry
to
be
the
sultan
wife
he
remarked
it
is
an
honour
for
any
woman
to
be
loved
by
the
sultan
even
a
woman
as
lovely
and
learned
as
you
little
mother
at
annette
was
even
more
beautiful
than
on
the
day
the
sultan
casim
ammeh
first
saw
her
but
more
fragile
and
ethereal
although
her
captor
fancy
often
strayed
to
other
women
he
never
lost
his
passion
for
her
oh
my
boy
you
do
understand
she
said
sadly
when
you
are
a
man
i
tell
you
and
then
perhaps
you
think
differently
when
i
am
a
man
i
shall
be
like
my
father
but
richer
and
more
powerful
because
i
shall
have
more
knowledge
thanks
to
you
my
mother
i
hope
you
will
be
like
your
father
raoul
i
ask
for
nothing
better
when
her
boy
reached
manhood
annette
intended
to
tell
him
the
truth
and
to
leave
him
to
deal
with
the
situation
as
he
would
at
ten
years
her
son
had
as
much
general
knowledge
as
the
average
french
boy
of
his
age
thanks
to
his
mother
teachings
and
he
knew
too
a
great
deal
more
than
she
taught
him
he
was
a
big
lad
for
his
years
handsome
and
the
sultan
acknowledged
heir
on
every
side
there
were
people
anxious
to
spoil
him
and
curry
favour
with
him
in
the
scented
sensual
atmosphere
of
the
harem
he
learnt
things
his
mother
would
have
kept
from
him
but
she
was
powerless
among
so
many
all
ready
to
flatter
her
boy
and
gain
his
good
graces
when
i
grow
up
he
said
to
her
one
day
i
shall
have
a
hundred
wives
like
my
father
in
the
france
i
come
from
a
man
has
but
one
you
must
always
remember
that
raoul
only
one
then
mother
i
call
that
a
poor
country
how
can
a
man
be
satisfied
with
one
woman
my
father
has
promised
me
wives
of
my
own
when
i
am
sixteen
it
seemed
to
annette
that
in
this
profligate
atmosphere
her
boy
was
drifting
further
and
further
away
from
her
and
his
own
nation
becoming
daily
more
akin
to
the
barbaric
people
around
him
every
day
she
felt
she
must
tell
him
the
truth
yet
every
day
she
put
it
off
for
her
boy
was
only
a
child
still
and
in
his
anger
and
rage
he
would
not
be
able
to
keep
his
knowledge
from
the
sultan
then
evil
would
befall
him
it
was
written
that
many
years
were
to
pass
before
raoul
le
breton
learnt
the
truth
about
himself
soon
after
this
episode
the
sultan
took
the
boy
with
him
on
some
thieving
expedition
whilst
they
were
away
one
of
the
deadly
epidemics
that
occasionally
visited
swept
through
the
city
claiming
among
its
many
victims
annette
le
breton
chapter
iv
with
the
passing
years
the
sultan
casim
ammeh
increased
in
wealth
and
power
he
gave
very
little
thought
to
france
now
it
was
a
vague
power
too
far
away
to
trouble
him
and
only
once
had
it
really
sent
a
feeler
in
his
direction
that
expedition
headed
by
colonel
le
breton
emboldened
by
his
success
he
had
extended
his
marauding
but
if
he
heard
nothing
more
of
france
france
occasionally
heard
of
him
in
the
form
of
complaints
from
various
parts
of
the
protectorate
from
other
chiefs
whose
territory
he
had
raided
the
government
knew
his
name
but
it
had
no
idea
where
he
came
from
on
one
occasion
the
sultan
and
his
robber
horde
swept
down
to
within
a
hundred
miles
of
louis
but
there
he
met
with
a
severe
defeat
he
retired
to
his
desert
stronghold
deciding
not
to
adventure
in
that
direction
again
and
he
owed
his
defeat
to
strange
guns
such
as
had
not
come
into
his
life
before
guns
that
fired
not
a
couple
of
shots
but
a
whole
volley
an
endless
fusillade
that
even
his
wild
warriors
could
not
face
he
went
back
to
determined
to
get
hold
of
some
of
those
wonderful
guns
obviously
it
was
out
of
the
question
to
attack
louis
where
they
came
from
if
they
were
to
be
obtained
they
must
be
searched
for
in
some
other
direction
sore
with
defeat
he
brooded
on
the
strange
guns
and
very
often
he
talked
of
them
to
the
boy
he
called
his
son
raoul
le
breton
was
about
thirteen
when
the
sultan
met
with
his
first
rebuff
at
the
hands
of
france
and
he
had
the
welfare
and
prestige
of
the
desert
kingdom
at
heart
and
was
as
anxious
as
the
sultan
to
possess
this
new
weapon
far
away
in
the
south
was
the
outpost
of
another
european
power
just
a
handful
of
white
men
struggling
to
keep
a
hold
on
a
country
an
indifferent
and
government
was
inclined
to
let
slip
round
and
about
the
river
gambia
the
british
had
a
footing
among
the
men
most
determined
to
keep
a
hold
on
this
strip
of
territory
was
captain
george
barclay
he
was
a
man
of
about
of
medium
height
and
wiry
make
with
a
thin
face
and
steady
grey
eyes
where
tragedy
lurked
his
confrères
said
that
barclay
had
no
interests
outside
of
his
work
but
they
were
wrong
he
had
one
thing
that
was
more
to
him
than
his
own
life
a
tiny
daughter
he
had
come
out
to
africa
in
quest
of
forgetfulness
at
although
he
was
only
a
penniless
lieutenant
the
beauty
of
the
london
season
the
prospective
heiress
of
millions
had
thought
well
to
marry
him
it
was
a
runaway
match
for
his
sake
pansy
carrington
had
risked
losing
both
wealth
and
position
she
was
only
nineteen
and
her
guardian
and
godfather
whose
acknowledged
heiress
she
was
had
disapproved
of
george
barclay
gossip
said
because
he
was
madly
in
love
with
her
himself
although
he
was
nearly
thirty
years
her
senior
however
whether
this
was
so
or
not
henry
langham
had
forgiven
the
girl
he
had
taken
her
back
into
his
good
graces
and
in
due
course
had
become
godfather
to
the
second
pansy
the
child
called
him
as
soon
as
she
could
talk
it
had
seemed
to
george
barclay
that
no
man
life
could
be
happier
than
his
then
without
any
warning
tragedy
came
upon
him
after
five
years
of
bliss
for
one
day
his
was
brought
back
to
him
dead
the
result
of
an
accident
in
the
with
her
death
all
light
had
gone
out
of
his
life
to
escape
from
himself
he
had
gone
out
to
gambia
and
his
tiny
daughter
now
lived
as
her
mother
had
lived
before
her
with
her
godfather
henry
langham
but
it
was
not
of
his
daughter
barclay
was
thinking
at
that
moment
other
matters
occupied
his
mind
he
stood
on
the
roof
of
a
little
stone
fort
gazing
at
the
landscape
in
a
speculative
manner
the
building
itself
consisted
of
four
rooms
set
on
a
platform
of
rock
some
three
feet
from
the
ground
all
the
windows
were
small
and
high
up
and
barred
one
room
had
no
communication
with
the
others
it
was
a
sort
of
guardroom
entered
by
a
heavy
wooden
door
to
the
other
three
rooms
one
solid
door
gave
entry
and
from
one
of
them
a
ladder
and
led
up
to
the
roof
which
had
battlements
around
it
below
was
a
large
compound
rudely
stockaded
in
which
half
a
dozen
native
huts
were
built
in
that
part
of
gambia
captain
barclay
represented
the
british
government
he
had
to
administer
justice
and
keep
the
peace
and
in
this
task
he
was
aided
by
a
white
subaltern
twenty
hausa
soldiers
and
a
couple
of
maxim
guns
on
three
sides
of
the
little
british
outpost
an
endless
expanse
of
forest
showed
with
white
mist
curling
like
smoke
about
it
on
the
fourth
was
a
wide
shallow
valley
with
dwarf
cliffs
on
either
side
alive
with
baboons
the
valley
was
patched
with
swamps
and
lakes
and
through
it
a
river
wended
an
erratic
course
its
banks
heavily
fringed
with
reeds
and
mimosa
trees
a
valley
from
which
with
approaching
evening
a
stream
of
miasma
rose
barclay
gaze
however
never
strayed
in
the
direction
of
the
shallow
valley
he
looked
to
the
north
a
week
or
so
ago
word
had
come
through
that
a
notorious
raider
was
on
the
move
a
man
whom
the
french
government
had
been
endeavouring
to
catch
for
the
last
five
years
or
more
what
he
was
doing
so
far
south
as
gambia
the
district
officer
did
not
know
but
he
knew
he
was
there
only
the
previous
day
news
had
come
that
one
of
the
villages
within
his
barclay
jurisdiction
had
been
practically
wiped
out
a
similar
fate
might
easily
fall
to
the
lot
of
the
british
outpost
considering
that
the
arab
chief
force
outnumbered
barclay
ten
to
one
from
the
roof
of
his
quarters
the
englishman
saw
the
sun
set
it
seemed
to
sink
and
drown
in
a
lake
of
orange
that
lay
like
a
blazing
furnace
on
the
horizon
a
lake
that
spread
and
scattered
when
the
sun
disappeared
drifting
off
in
islands
of
clouds
gold
rose
mauve
and
vivid
red
sailing
slowly
across
a
tense
blue
sky
getting
ever
thinner
and
more
ragged
until
night
came
suddenly
and
swallowed
up
their
tattered
remains
a
dense
purple
darkness
fell
upon
the
land
soft
and
velvety
that
reminded
barclay
of
his
little
daughter
eyes
and
in
a
vault
as
darkly
purple
a
host
of
great
stars
flashed
away
in
the
forest
an
owl
hooted
from
the
wide
valley
came
the
coughing
roar
of
a
leopard
every
now
and
again
some
night
bird
passed
a
vague
shadow
in
the
darkness
in
silver
showers
the
fireflies
danced
in
the
thick
hot
air
down
in
the
compound
showed
looking
like
a
lot
of
smouldering
cigarette
ends
cast
carelessly
aside
upon
the
roof
with
gaze
fixed
on
the
misty
baffling
darkness
that
soughed
and
hissed
around
him
barclay
stayed
until
the
gong
took
him
down
to
dinner
there
his
junior
waited
a
youngster
of
about
nineteen
the
meal
was
a
poor
repast
of
tinned
soup
hashed
tinned
beef
yams
and
coffee
all
badly
cooked
and
indifferently
served
during
the
course
of
the
meal
the
youngster
remarked
what
a
joke
if
we
nabbed
the
sultan
casim
ammeh
or
whatever
he
calls
himself
and
went
one
better
than
the
french
johnnies
it
would
be
more
than
a
joke
it
would
be
a
jolly
good
riddance
barclay
responded
it
queer
nobody
knowing
where
he
really
comes
from
you
may
be
sure
he
does
play
his
tricks
anywhere
near
his
own
headquarters
more
likely
than
not
he
and
his
lot
start
out
disguised
as
peaceful
merchants
in
separate
bands
and
join
up
when
they
reach
the
seat
of
operations
there
are
vast
tracts
of
senegal
practically
unexplored
they
would
give
endless
cover
to
one
of
his
kidney
if
you
had
the
luck
to
bag
him
what
should
you
do
shoot
him
straight
off
knowing
the
earth
was
well
rid
of
a
villain
but
what
his
idea
in
coming
as
far
south
as
this
he
never
been
heard
of
on
this
side
of
the
senegal
river
before
plunder
guns
most
likely
he
heard
we
none
too
welcome
and
hardly
settled
here
and
thinks
we
shall
prove
an
easy
prey
however
the
little
english
force
was
not
to
prove
quite
the
easy
prey
the
sultan
had
imagined
when
he
came
south
in
quest
of
new
weapons
the
next
night
without
any
warning
he
attacked
barclay
headquarters
he
struck
at
an
hour
when
all
was
darkest
not
with
his
usual
swoop
of
wild
horsemen
but
stealthily
unchallenged
and
unmolested
he
and
his
following
scaled
the
stockade
and
crept
towards
the
tiny
fort
vague
shadows
moving
silently
in
the
purple
darkness
but
each
night
barclay
had
laid
a
trap
for
his
expected
foe
he
knew
the
enemy
force
outnumbered
his
and
that
his
little
handful
could
be
starved
out
within
a
week
if
the
arab
chief
wanted
to
make
a
siege
of
it
barclay
had
no
intention
of
letting
this
come
to
pass
he
did
a
bold
thing
each
night
after
dark
the
little
british
garrison
divided
into
three
units
a
hausa
sergeant
and
fifteen
men
were
left
on
the
roof
of
the
fort
barclay
two
soldiers
and
one
maxim
gun
his
junior
with
two
more
soldiers
and
the
other
gun
crept
out
from
the
place
and
hid
in
the
dense
undergrowth
at
different
points
outside
of
the
stockade
first
removing
a
plank
here
and
there
in
the
enclosure
to
enable
them
to
work
their
guns
through
barclay
ruse
succeeded
whilst
the
sultan
and
his
followers
were
busy
trying
to
scale
the
fort
and
get
at
the
handful
of
men
peppering
at
them
from
its
roof
without
any
warning
there
came
an
unexpected
fusillade
from
the
rear
he
turned
and
attacked
in
that
direction
only
to
find
a
further
fusillade
pouring
in
on
him
from
another
point
the
sultan
sensed
that
he
had
fallen
into
a
trap
that
he
was
surrounded
on
all
sides
sore
and
furious
he
turned
to
go
more
quickly
than
he
had
come
but
before
he
had
reached
the
stockade
the
world
slipped
from
him
suddenly
chapter
v
when
the
skirmish
was
over
barclay
and
his
junior
with
half
a
dozen
hausas
and
a
lantern
or
two
made
a
round
of
the
compound
counting
the
dead
and
attending
to
the
wounded
his
own
garrison
was
practically
unscathed
but
his
guns
had
played
grim
havoc
with
the
attacking
party
fully
fifty
dead
and
wounded
lay
within
the
stockade
barclay
went
about
his
task
cautiously
he
knew
arabs
and
their
little
ways
giving
no
quarter
themselves
they
expected
none
and
would
sham
death
and
then
stab
those
who
came
to
succour
them
among
the
prisoners
was
a
lean
lithe
man
of
about
forty
who
appeared
more
stunned
than
hurt
from
a
bullet
that
had
grazed
his
forehead
barclay
came
across
the
wounded
man
just
when
the
latter
was
coming
back
to
consciousness
although
in
dress
he
differed
in
no
way
from
the
rest
of
his
following
the
knives
in
his
belt
were
heavily
jewelled
and
gems
flashed
on
his
brown
fingers
by
the
light
of
a
lantern
the
englishman
scanned
him
noting
his
array
of
jewels
and
his
cruel
arrogant
commanding
face
the
face
of
a
savage
leader
my
son
he
said
to
the
subaltern
i
believe
your
joke
has
come
to
pass
my
joke
the
youngster
repeated
blankly
then
the
light
of
understanding
came
to
his
face
you
do
mean
to
say
this
cuss
is
the
sultan
casim
ammeh
i
be
surprised
to
hear
he
was
barclay
responded
suspicious
of
his
man
and
knowing
him
to
be
no
more
than
stunned
the
captain
had
him
handcuffed
and
locked
up
in
one
of
the
inner
rooms
of
the
fort
when
the
wounded
had
been
attended
to
they
were
left
in
the
guardroom
and
the
little
garrison
retired
once
more
within
the
fort
the
enemy
had
had
such
a
thorough
beating
that
barclay
did
not
expect
another
attack
for
all
that
he
was
taking
no
risks
just
before
daybreak
when
the
world
was
a
place
of
curling
white
mist
and
greyness
there
came
a
stampede
of
horses
and
above
the
thunder
of
hoofs
the
wild
mohammedan
deen
deen
muhammed
that
wild
swoop
and
yell
was
the
sultan
usual
way
of
attacking
it
seems
we
did
get
our
man
last
night
barclay
remarked
as
the
guns
were
trained
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
according
to
report
this
is
his
usual
method
of
attack
out
of
the
greyness
of
approaching
morning
a
mêlée
of
wild
horsemen
appeared
their
leader
was
hardly
the
man
barclay
had
pictured
to
himself
as
the
arab
chief
but
a
youth
in
white
burnoose
mounted
on
a
huge
black
stallion
more
than
this
barclay
did
not
wait
to
see
he
opened
fire
on
the
massed
horsemen
his
guns
playing
deadly
havoc
within
a
few
minutes
their
ranks
broke
in
wild
disorder
they
turned
and
stampeded
back
soon
to
be
lost
in
the
screening
mist
i
do
think
they
face
another
dose
the
junior
remarked
however
he
was
wrong
presently
from
out
of
the
fog
came
the
same
wild
and
the
thunder
of
hoofs
there
was
another
charge
with
sadly
depleted
numbers
for
reckless
courage
barclay
had
never
seen
anything
to
equal
their
youthful
leader
again
and
again
he
rallied
his
men
and
brought
them
on
until
finally
with
only
about
a
dozen
men
he
swept
through
the
deadly
zone
and
on
towards
the
fort
in
the
very
teeth
of
the
maxims
his
black
horse
literally
flew
over
the
high
stockade
but
the
youngster
was
the
only
one
who
faced
the
guns
his
following
broke
up
and
turned
back
under
the
fierce
fusillade
although
the
leader
got
over
the
stockade
alive
his
horse
did
not
it
crashed
and
fell
dead
beneath
him
with
a
quick
side
spring
a
marvellous
piece
of
horsemanship
he
avoided
injury
and
with
drawn
sword
rushed
on
towards
the
little
fort
the
hausas
would
have
shot
down
the
reckless
youngster
but
barclay
stopped
them
we
do
make
war
on
children
he
said
in
their
dialect
a
closer
inspection
showed
the
leader
of
the
arab
horde
to
be
hardly
more
than
a
child
a
handsome
boy
of
about
fourteen
who
suddenly
realising
that
his
followers
had
deserted
him
now
stood
gazing
round
in
a
fierce
thwarted
fashion
on
finding
he
was
alone
he
did
not
retreat
although
barclay
gave
him
every
opportunity
instead
he
stood
his
ground
and
hurled
a
challenge
in
arabic
at
the
men
clustered
on
the
top
of
the
fort
since
there
was
no
reply
to
that
he
shouted
again
this
time
in
french
who
and
what
is
the
youngster
barclay
asked
he
does
look
any
more
arabian
than
i
do
and
now
he
yelling
at
us
in
pure
parisian
french
however
nobody
could
find
any
reply
so
barclay
descended
alone
to
interview
the
one
remaining
member
of
the
sultan
casim
forces
he
was
hardly
out
in
the
compound
before
he
wished
he
had
not
gone
he
had
just
time
to
draw
his
sword
when
the
boy
fell
upon
him
barclay
was
a
skilled
duellist
but
in
this
wild
youth
from
the
desert
he
met
his
match
for
all
his
finesse
and
superior
height
and
weight
the
englishman
had
his
cheek
laid
open
and
his
arm
ripped
up
in
the
course
of
a
minute
things
would
have
gone
badly
with
him
except
that
a
shot
from
his
junior
put
the
boy
sword
arm
out
of
action
with
a
rattle
his
weapon
fell
to
the
ground
his
arm
useless
at
his
side
but
even
then
there
was
no
plea
for
mercy
with
a
proud
gesture
he
threw
up
his
head
facing
his
enemy
in
arrogant
fashion
kill
me
he
said
in
french
but
let
my
father
live
who
is
your
father
barclay
asked
as
with
a
handkerchief
he
tried
to
stop
the
blood
gushing
from
his
cheek
the
sultan
casim
ammeh
the
boy
answered
proudly
the
reply
told
barclay
that
the
man
he
had
under
lock
and
key
really
was
the
marauding
arab
chief
he
scanned
the
boy
closely
except
for
his
hair
and
eyes
and
fierce
arrogant
expression
there
was
no
resemblance
between
father
and
son
if
he
had
not
heard
to
the
contrary
he
would
have
said
the
boy
was
as
french
as
the
language
he
spoke
i
no
intention
of
killing
barclay
remarked
on
the
contrary
young
man
i
going
to
have
your
arm
set
and
bound
up
before
you
bleed
to
death
the
blood
was
dripping
from
the
boy
fingers
making
a
pool
on
the
ground
but
he
paid
no
heed
to
his
own
hurt
all
his
thoughts
were
for
the
sultan
casim
i
not
asking
mercy
for
myself
but
for
my
father
he
said
haughtily
i
afraid
that
useless
considering
two
governments
have
condemned
him
you
will
dare
to
kill
him
barclay
said
nothing
but
his
very
silence
was
ominous
a
dazed
incredulous
look
crossed
the
boy
face
as
the
englishman
watched
him
it
seemed
that
murderer
as
the
sultan
was
at
least
this
big
handsome
son
of
his
loved
him
like
one
stunned
the
youngster
submitted
to
being
led
into
the
fort
where
his
arm
was
set
and
his
wounds
bound
up
when
this
was
done
he
said
to
barclay
i
give
you
wealth
in
jewels
that
will
amount
to
three
hundred
thousand
francs
in
french
money
if
you
will
let
my
father
go
free
and
take
my
life
instead
barclay
made
no
reply
you
will
murder
my
father
the
boy
went
on
dreading
the
worst
from
barclay
silence
the
word
made
the
englishman
wince
for
it
did
seem
like
murder
with
this
fierce
handsome
boy
pleading
desperately
for
his
father
life
again
he
said
nothing
to
escape
from
the
sight
of
the
pain
and
anguish
his
silent
verdict
had
aroused
barclay
went
from
the
room
leaving
the
youngster
in
the
charge
of
a
couple
of
soldiers
about
noon
that
day
at
the
hands
of
the
british
government
the
sultan
casim
ammeh
met
a
end
he
met
it
bravely
refusing
to
be
blindfolded
with
a
slight
cruel
smile
facing
the
guns
levelled
at
him
it
was
evening
before
barclay
summoned
up
enough
courage
to
meet
his
youthful
prisoner
and
when
he
did
it
seemed
he
had
never
seen
so
much
concentrated
hatred
on
any
face
so
you
shot
my
father
the
boy
said
in
a
slow
savage
manner
barclay
had
not
come
to
discuss
the
dead
malefactor
he
wanted
to
learn
more
about
the
son
where
he
had
learnt
his
excellent
french
how
he
came
to
differ
so
in
appearance
from
the
arab
chief
and
his
wild
following
your
father
has
paid
the
penalty
of
his
crimes
he
said
quietly
and
you
shall
pay
the
penalty
of
yours
the
boy
cried
passionately
for
i
shall
kill
you
as
you
have
killed
my
father
your
daughters
i
shall
sell
as
slaves
your
sons
shall
toil
in
chains
in
my
city
your
wives
shall
become
the
bondswomen
of
my
servants
remember
white
man
for
i
do
not
speak
lightly
i
will
be
avenged
i
casim
ammeh
whose
father
you
have
thought
well
to
murder
the
savage
threats
of
a
wild
boy
did
not
trouble
george
barclay
much
but
his
mind
did
go
to
his
tiny
daughter
and
he
was
glad
she
was
safe
in
england
and
not
within
reach
of
this
savage
lad
at
that
moment
he
was
more
worried
about
his
youthful
captive
than
the
latter
wild
threats
he
did
not
want
to
make
a
criminal
of
the
boy
for
obviously
whatever
wrong
he
had
done
was
done
under
the
influence
of
his
savage
father
and
there
looked
to
be
the
makings
of
a
fine
man
in
him
if
only
he
had
good
guidance
barclay
decided
to
put
the
case
before
the
french
government
together
with
a
suggestion
of
his
own
that
the
youngster
should
be
sent
somewhere
where
he
could
be
brought
up
to
be
of
use
to
the
country
not
a
constant
thorn
in
its
flesh
as
his
father
had
been
but
captain
barclay
need
not
have
troubled
himself
with
making
plans
for
the
future
of
the
youthful
sultan
of
for
that
night
the
boy
escaped
and
his
future
was
left
in
his
own
hands
chapter
vi
after
some
two
years
out
in
gambia
george
barclay
returned
to
england
he
returned
with
a
scar
across
his
right
cheek
that
scar
was
the
first
thing
his
little
daughter
remarked
upon
when
the
excitement
of
reunion
had
died
down
perched
on
his
knee
she
touched
it
with
gentle
little
fingers
and
kissed
it
with
soft
lips
who
has
hurt
my
nice
new
daddy
she
asked
distressfully
then
there
followed
the
story
of
the
youthful
sultan
casim
ammeh
oh
what
a
wicked
boy
she
exclaimed
then
she
glanced
across
at
her
godfather
who
was
sitting
near
is
he
a
bad
naughty
boy
to
want
to
kill
my
daddy
and
sell
me
as
a
slave
henry
langham
had
listened
to
the
story
with
interest
and
very
heartily
he
agreed
with
her
i
shall
tell
bobby
the
little
girl
went
on
indignantly
and
go
and
kill
the
sultan
casim
ammeh
who
bobby
her
father
asked
my
sweetheart
master
robert
cameron
so
in
my
absence
i
been
cut
out
have
i
her
father
said
teasingly
i
dreadfully
jealous
but
pansy
snuggled
closer
to
him
and
her
arms
went
round
his
neck
in
a
tight
hug
there
never
be
anyone
as
nice
as
my
daddy
she
whispered
george
barclay
held
the
tiny
girl
closer
kissing
the
golden
head
often
during
his
months
in
england
pansy
would
scramble
on
his
knee
and
say
daddy
tell
me
the
story
of
casim
ammeh
that
naughty
boy
who
hurt
your
poor
face
to
pansy
it
was
some
new
arabian
nights
vastly
interesting
because
her
father
was
one
of
the
principal
characters
although
she
had
heard
it
quite
fifty
times
she
was
ready
to
hear
it
quite
fifty
times
more
but
my
darling
you
heard
it
scores
of
times
barclay
said
one
day
for
all
that
he
told
the
story
again
quietly
she
listened
until
the
end
was
reached
then
she
said
i
do
like
him
not
one
little
bit
do
you
like
him
daddy
to
tell
you
the
truth
pansy
i
did
like
him
he
was
a
very
brave
boy
i
shall
never
like
him
because
he
hurt
you
she
said
firmly
her
little
face
set
and
determined
well
my
girlie
you
never
likely
to
meet
him
so
it
wo
make
much
difference
to
him
whether
you
like
him
or
not
but
in
the
book
of
fate
it
was
written
otherwise
chapter
vii
somewhere
off
the
boulevard
michel
there
is
a
cabaret
the
big
dancing
hall
has
red
walls
painted
with
yellow
shooting
stars
and
overhead
electric
lights
blaze
under
red
and
yellow
shades
there
is
a
bar
at
one
end
and
several
little
tables
for
the
patrons
use
when
they
tire
of
dancing
in
the
evenings
a
band
in
seedy
red
uniforms
with
brass
buttons
fills
with
a
crash
of
sound
an
atmosphere
ladened
with
patchouli
and
cigarette
smoke
and
waiters
in
still
more
seedy
attend
to
the
tables
never
at
any
time
is
the
gathering
select
and
generally
there
are
quite
a
few
foreigners
of
all
colours
present
one
night
the
most
noticeable
among
the
patrons
was
an
englishman
and
tailored
and
a
big
youth
of
about
eighteen
in
a
flowing
white
burnoose
they
were
in
no
way
connected
with
each
other
but
chance
in
the
shape
of
their
female
companions
had
brought
them
to
adjacent
tables
the
girl
with
the
youngster
was
very
pretty
in
a
hard
metallic
way
with
the
white
face
and
vivid
red
lips
of
the
parisienne
and
brown
eyes
bright
and
that
were
about
as
expressionless
as
pebbles
she
was
attired
in
a
cheap
black
evening
dress
cut
very
low
and
about
her
plump
throat
was
a
coral
necklace
her
hair
was
elaborately
dressed
and
her
shoes
although
well
worn
were
tidy
by
day
marie
hamon
earned
a
meagre
living
for
herself
in
a
shop
at
night
she
added
to
her
earnings
in
the
recognized
way
of
quite
a
few
of
the
working
girls
of
paris
and
this
particular
cabaret
was
one
of
her
hunting
grounds
as
marie
sat
there
making
eyes
at
the
youth
in
the
white
burnoose
the
man
at
the
next
table
remarked
in
french
in
an
audible
and
disgusted
tone
look
at
that
girl
there
making
up
to
that
young
nigger
a
beastly
spectacle
i
call
it
before
his
companion
had
time
to
reply
the
youth
was
up
his
black
eyes
flashing
and
he
grasped
the
englishman
shoulder
in
an
angry
indignant
fashion
i
am
no
nigger
he
cried
i
the
sultan
casim
ammeh
i
do
care
a
damn
who
you
are
so
long
as
you
keep
your
black
paws
off
me
the
youth
hands
were
not
black
but
deeply
bronzed
like
his
face
which
looked
darker
than
it
really
was
against
the
whiteness
of
his
hood
take
back
that
word
he
said
savagely
or
by
allah
it
shall
be
wiped
out
in
blood
he
drew
his
knife
the
girls
screamed
excited
waiters
rushed
towards
the
table
the
mixed
company
stopped
dancing
and
pressed
forward
to
watch
what
looked
like
the
beginning
of
a
royal
row
such
incidents
were
by
no
means
unusual
in
the
cabaret
only
the
englishman
remained
calm
he
grasped
his
opponent
wrist
quickly
no
you
do
he
said
you
damned
niggers
seem
to
think
you
own
the
world
nowadays
there
was
a
brief
scuffle
but
the
englishman
was
big
and
heavy
and
half
a
dozen
waiters
were
hanging
on
to
the
enraged
and
insulted
youth
his
knife
was
wrested
from
his
hand
he
was
hustled
this
way
and
that
and
finally
worsted
and
smouldering
he
retired
to
be
led
to
another
and
more
distant
table
by
his
female
companion
the
episode
was
over
in
a
couple
of
minutes
disappointed
at
the
lack
of
bloodshed
the
spectators
returned
to
their
dancing
relieved
the
waiters
went
back
to
their
various
spheres
the
englishman
seated
himself
again
as
if
nothing
had
happened
at
a
distant
table
the
youth
sat
and
glowered
at
him
who
is
that
man
he
asked
presently
pointing
a
lean
forefinger
at
his
late
opponent
marie
shrugged
her
plump
shoulders
i
never
seen
him
here
before
he
looks
to
me
like
an
englishman
with
renewed
interest
the
youth
studied
the
distant
figure
hate
smouldering
in
his
black
eyes
so
he
was
one
of
the
nation
who
had
murdered
his
father
this
man
who
had
insulted
him
but
for
all
his
hatred
of
the
englishman
reluctantly
he
admired
his
coolness
and
his
clothes
the
world
had
enlarged
for
annette
le
breton
son
since
his
first
experience
with
the
english
on
escaping
from
barclay
with
the
remaining
handful
of
the
defunct
sultan
following
he
had
returned
to
at
the
age
of
fourteen
its
recognised
ruler
the
boy
was
not
lacking
in
sense
defeat
at
the
hands
of
both
british
and
french
made
him
decide
to
give
up
what
had
been
the
late
chief
source
of
income
marauding
with
a
wisdom
beyond
his
years
casim
ammeh
as
he
was
now
always
called
decided
to
go
in
for
trading
and
before
many
years
had
passed
he
saw
it
was
a
better
paying
game
than
marauding
despite
its
lack
of
excitement
then
he
extended
his
operations
there
were
always
caravans
coming
to
his
desert
city
and
a
great
demand
for
articles
that
came
from
the
europe
his
mother
had
told
him
of
with
one
or
two
of
his
principal
merchants
he
went
down
to
louis
but
he
did
not
go
as
the
sultan
casim
ammeh
that
name
was
too
well
known
to
the
french
government
instead
he
went
under
the
name
his
mother
used
to
call
him
raoul
le
breton
and
under
that
name
he
opened
a
store
in
louis
there
was
a
new
generation
in
the
town
since
his
real
father
day
and
the
name
roused
no
comment
it
was
an
ordinary
french
one
in
louis
there
were
quite
a
few
as
the
youth
supposed
himself
to
be
living
and
trading
under
european
names
his
business
ventures
were
so
successful
that
he
opened
several
more
stores
at
various
points
between
louis
and
his
own
capital
but
the
whereabouts
of
his
own
city
he
did
not
divulge
to
strangers
at
sixteen
it
had
seemed
to
the
boy
that
louis
was
the
hub
of
the
universe
but
at
eighteen
a
craving
that
amounted
to
nostalgia
drove
him
further
afield
to
paris
and
he
went
in
arabian
garments
for
he
was
intensely
proud
of
his
sultanship
and
the
desert
kingdom
he
ruled
with
undisputed
sway
to
his
surprise
he
felt
wonderfully
at
home
in
his
mother
city
it
did
not
feel
as
strange
as
louis
had
felt
but
more
as
if
he
had
once
lived
there
and
had
forgotten
about
it
he
had
been
a
couple
of
days
in
paris
wandering
at
will
when
on
the
second
evening
his
wanderings
had
brought
him
in
contact
with
marie
hamon
she
was
by
no
means
the
first
of
her
sort
to
accost
him
but
she
was
the
first
he
had
condescended
to
take
any
notice
of
she
had
smiled
at
him
as
aloof
and
haughty
he
had
stalked
along
the
boulevard
michel
and
had
fallen
into
step
beside
him
he
had
looked
at
her
in
a
peculiar
manner
that
was
half
amusement
half
contempt
but
he
had
not
shaken
her
off
she
had
suggested
they
should
have
dinner
together
and
he
had
fallen
in
with
her
suggestion
not
exactly
with
alacrity
but
as
if
he
wanted
to
study
the
girl
further
for
all
her
plump
prettiness
and
profession
there
was
a
shrewd
sensible
air
about
her
afterwards
at
her
instigation
they
had
repaired
to
the
cabaret
as
the
youth
continued
to
scowl
at
the
distant
englishman
with
the
idea
of
preventing
further
trouble
marie
tried
to
get
his
mind
on
other
matters
casim
let
have
a
dance
she
suggested
i
can
afford
to
pay
for
hired
dancers
so
why
should
i
posture
for
the
benefit
of
others
he
asked
scornfully
she
tittered
well
get
me
another
drink
instead
then
he
beckoned
a
waiter
and
gave
a
curt
order
however
he
did
not
touch
the
cheap
champagne
himself
instead
he
kept
strictly
to
coffee
have
a
drop
of
cognac
in
it
to
cheer
you
up
a
bit
marie
said
you
make
me
feel
as
if
i
were
at
a
funeral
i
a
mohammedan
and
strong
drink
is
forbidden
you
are
the
limit
i
should
quarrel
with
the
good
things
of
this
life
even
if
i
were
a
mohammedan
by
my
religion
women
have
no
souls
he
replied
in
a
voice
that
spoke
volumes
but
marie
was
not
easily
abashed
the
lack
of
a
soul
does
trouble
me
in
the
least
she
responded
lightly
a
pretty
body
is
of
greater
use
to
a
woman
any
day
do
you
think
i
pretty
casim
she
finished
coquettishly
i
should
be
with
you
unless
you
were
he
replied
as
if
her
question
were
an
insult
to
his
taste
for
some
minutes
there
was
silence
as
the
girl
sipped
her
champagne
she
watched
her
escort
in
a
calculating
manner
you
got
lots
of
money
have
you
she
said
presently
not
as
much
as
i
intend
to
have
he
replied
but
enough
to
buy
me
a
new
frock
she
questioned
fifty
if
you
want
them
marie
threw
her
arms
around
his
neck
you
nice
boy
she
cried
kissing
him
soundly
he
resented
her
attentions
removing
her
arms
in
a
none
too
gentle
manner
i
object
to
such
displays
of
affection
in
public
he
said
with
an
air
of
ruffled
dignity
come
home
with
me
then
she
suggested
home
to
marie
was
an
attic
in
a
poor
street
there
casim
ammeh
went
not
as
a
victim
to
her
charms
as
she
imagined
but
seeing
in
her
a
means
to
his
own
end
the
next
morning
as
he
sat
at
breakfast
with
the
girl
a
meagre
repast
of
black
coffee
and
rolls
from
somewhere
out
of
his
voluminous
robes
he
produced
a
string
of
pearls
and
dangled
it
before
his
hostess
marie
looked
at
them
her
mouth
round
with
surprise
for
they
were
real
and
worth
at
least
ten
thousand
francs
if
i
give
you
these
marie
will
you
teach
me
to
become
a
frenchman
he
asked
wo
i
just
she
cried
enthusiastically
and
without
hesitation
continued
first
of
all
we
must
get
an
apartment
and
dieu
yes
you
must
cut
your
hair
short
the
youth
wore
his
hair
long
knotted
under
his
hood
in
the
arab
fashion
it
was
three
months
before
casim
ammeh
left
paris
and
he
left
it
in
a
correctly
cut
english
suit
and
with
his
smooth
black
hair
brushed
back
over
his
head
in
the
young
man
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
recognise
the
barbaric
youth
who
had
come
there
knowing
nothing
of
civilised
life
except
what
his
mother
had
told
him
and
what
he
had
seen
in
louis
and
what
was
more
he
felt
at
ease
in
his
new
garments
in
spite
of
having
worn
burnoose
and
hood
all
his
life
the
day
before
he
left
marie
sat
with
him
in
the
of
the
pretty
flat
they
had
occupied
since
the
day
they
struck
their
bargain
and
she
looked
very
different
too
her
evening
frock
was
no
longer
of
shabby
black
it
was
one
of
the
several
elaborate
gowns
she
now
possessed
thanks
to
the
young
man
and
she
no
longer
wore
a
string
of
coral
beads
about
her
pretty
throat
but
the
pearl
necklace
although
marie
had
taken
on
the
youth
as
a
business
speculation
within
a
few
days
she
loved
him
passionately
she
was
loath
to
let
her
benefactor
go
but
all
her
wiles
failed
to
keep
him
when
you
back
in
africa
you
wo
quite
forget
your
little
marie
who
taught
you
to
be
a
man
will
you
she
whispered
tearfully
her
remarks
made
him
laugh
i
had
women
of
my
own
for
at
least
a
year
before
i
met
you
he
replied
it
seemed
to
marie
she
had
never
really
known
the
youth
who
had
come
to
her
a
savage
and
was
leaving
her
looking
a
finished
man
of
the
world
he
never
talked
to
her
of
himself
or
his
affairs
although
kind
and
generous
he
demanded
swift
obedience
and
he
treated
her
always
as
something
infinitely
inferior
to
himself
say
you
love
me
she
pleaded
that
you
think
of
me
sometimes
love
he
said
contemptuously
i
do
love
women
i
have
them
for
my
pleasure
i
not
one
of
your
white
men
who
spend
their
days
whining
at
some
one
woman
feet
pleading
for
favours
women
to
me
are
only
toys
good
to
look
upon
if
beautiful
but
not
so
good
as
horses
oh
you
are
cruel
she
said
weeping
and
i
thought
you
loved
me
it
is
the
woman
place
to
love
there
are
other
things
in
a
life
marie
realised
she
had
never
had
any
hold
on
her
protégé
she
had
been
of
use
to
him
and
he
had
paid
her
well
for
it
and
there
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
the
matter
ended
being
sensible
she
sat
up
and
dried
her
tears
gathering
consolation
from
the
fact
that
he
had
been
a
good
speculation
there
would
be
no
immediate
need
to
return
to
the
florist
shop
when
he
had
gone
in
fact
if
she
liked
to
sell
the
necklace
she
could
buy
a
business
of
her
own
shall
you
come
to
paris
again
casim
she
asked
oh
yes
often
it
a
good
city
full
of
beautiful
women
who
are
easy
to
buy
but
he
made
a
reservation
to
himself
when
he
came
again
he
would
come
under
the
name
his
mother
used
to
call
him
raoul
le
breton
and
he
would
come
in
european
clothes
then
the
english
he
hated
would
not
be
able
to
hurl
that
detestable
word
nigger
at
him
chapter
viii
in
a
select
french
a
girl
sat
reading
a
letter
she
was
about
fifteen
years
old
a
slender
lovely
child
light
and
graceful
with
a
cascade
of
golden
curls
reaching
to
her
waist
and
wide
purple
eyes
her
complexion
was
perfect
she
had
a
vivid
little
red
mouth
impulsive
and
generous
and
a
pink
rose
on
each
cheek
on
reading
the
letter
sorrow
clouded
her
face
for
it
ran
my
dear
little
pansy
when
you
get
this
letter
i
shall
be
with
your
mother
i
am
leaving
you
the
money
she
would
not
have
and
it
was
worth
having
you
will
agree
for
it
will
bring
you
in
about
a
year
the
only
condition
i
make
is
that
you
take
the
name
your
mother
refused
your
own
second
name
and
my
one
hope
is
that
you
will
be
more
successful
in
love
than
i
was
your
affectionate
henry
langham
for
some
minutes
pansy
sat
brooding
on
her
godfather
end
the
poor
old
boy
had
been
awfully
ill
for
a
long
time
and
now
he
was
dead
she
blinked
back
a
couple
of
tears
then
her
thoughts
went
to
the
fortune
she
had
inherited
presently
she
crossed
to
the
mirror
and
looked
at
herself
no
old
girl
she
said
to
her
reflection
your
head
is
turned
then
she
slipped
the
letter
into
her
pocket
and
made
straight
for
her
great
friend
and
confidante
to
the
average
eye
there
was
nothing
about
miss
grainger
to
attract
a
vivid
beautiful
girl
like
pansy
barclay
pansy
langham
as
she
would
be
now
miss
grainger
was
thin
and
the
english
mistress
with
no
qualifications
except
good
breeding
she
was
poor
and
friendless
and
life
had
gone
hard
with
her
but
these
facts
were
sufficient
to
fill
pansy
heart
with
a
warmth
of
generous
affection
and
sympathy
the
girl
principal
thought
as
she
went
along
was
not
so
much
of
the
millions
she
had
just
inherited
but
that
she
had
always
wanted
to
do
something
for
miss
grainger
and
now
she
saw
a
way
of
doing
it
she
entered
the
room
that
served
the
english
mistress
as
bedroom
study
and
disturbing
the
latter
in
the
midst
of
correcting
an
accumulated
pile
of
exercise
books
what
is
it
pansy
she
asked
smiling
at
her
favourite
miss
grainger
you
be
pleased
to
hear
i
a
millionaire
the
english
mistress
put
down
her
pen
carefully
and
then
sat
staring
at
the
child
really
my
dear
she
said
in
a
bewildered
tone
you
have
a
way
of
saying
the
most
surprising
things
in
the
most
manner
but
since
you
saying
it
it
must
be
true
that
a
character
in
itself
pansy
remarked
smiling
a
smile
that
brought
to
view
several
bewitching
dimples
she
produced
the
letter
and
handed
it
to
her
friend
the
english
mistress
read
it
through
sixty
thousand
pounds
a
year
she
exclaimed
it
makes
my
head
reel
then
yours
ca
be
so
firmly
screwed
on
as
mine
mine
is
turned
one
little
bit
i
looked
at
myself
in
a
glass
to
see
but
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
it
all
the
governess
asked
helplessly
spend
it
of
course
i
take
after
my
father
and
never
shirk
an
unpleasant
duty
she
went
on
a
mischievous
glint
in
her
eyes
to
begin
with
you
miss
grainger
are
going
to
be
my
companion
and
have
a
yacht
and
go
all
round
the
world
together
and
see
and
do
everything
that
can
be
seen
and
done
you
get
married
pansy
the
governess
said
looking
lovingly
at
the
beautiful
little
face
not
much
you
dear
old
antiquated
thing
i
not
going
to
be
tied
by
the
leg
in
that
fashion
as
the
english
mistress
i
must
remind
you
that
by
the
leg
is
slang
when
you
my
companion
you
be
talking
slang
yourself
i
not
so
sure
i
wo
make
that
one
of
the
stipulations
the
child
went
on
teasingly
it
be
such
a
change
for
you
after
thirty
years
of
correcting
stupid
exercises
it
will
be
rather
miss
grainger
said
wistfully
and
i
shall
come
out
at
seventeen
pansy
went
on
i
must
start
as
early
as
possible
if
i
to
spend
all
that
money
i
shall
write
and
ask
my
father
if
i
may
come
out
at
seventeen
do
you
think
refuse
no
man
will
ever
refuse
you
anything
pansy
you
too
sweet
and
good
and
beautiful
and
rich
do
forget
the
rich
that
be
a
tremendous
draw
miss
grainger
smiled
at
her
favourite
i
hope
the
man
who
marries
you
will
pick
you
for
your
good
heart
and
generous
nature
not
your
looks
and
money
she
remarked
still
harping
on
that
old
string
noah
women
do
get
married
nowadays
if
they
can
afford
to
stay
single
then
the
school
ringing
sent
pansy
from
the
room
but
not
before
she
had

chapter
ix
paris
always
has
a
welcome
for
millionaires
and
it
always
had
a
specially
warm
welcome
for
raoul
le
breton
the
african
not
only
was
he
fabulously
rich
but
he
was
young
and
remarkably
it
was
whispered
that
he
had
arab
blood
in
his
veins
but
he
was
wealthy
enough
for
the
majority
to
overlook
this
drawback
like
many
modern
frenchmen
he
dabbled
in
le
sport
he
was
a
brilliant
tennis
player
a
worthy
opponent
at
billiards
and
he
kept
a
stud
of
there
was
hardly
an
actress
of
any
repute
and
with
any
pretence
to
youth
and
beauty
who
had
not
had
his
patronage
at
one
time
or
the
other
mothers
with
marriageable
daughters
laid
snares
about
his
feet
with
surprising
agility
he
avoided
their
traps
none
of
the
daughters
proved
sufficiently
tempting
to
turn
him
from
the
broad
smooth
way
of
gay
parisian
bachelorhood
to
the
steep
and
jagged
path
of
matrimony
raoul
le
breton
was
about
when
he
paid
his
sixth
visit
to
paris
he
came
now
for
about
three
months
every
year
and
he
always
came
in
style
with
a
whole
retinue
of
arab
servants
silent
discreet
men
who
never
gossiped
about
their
master
it
was
whispered
also
that
out
in
africa
he
had
a
whole
harem
of
his
own
moreover
that
he
was
some
big
chief
or
the
other
in
fact
many
things
were
whispered
about
him
for
on
the
whole
paris
knew
very
little
except
that
he
was
wealthy
and
wild
his
french
acquaintances
tried
to
learn
more
of
his
doings
through
the
medium
of
his
own
private
doctor
a
stout
frenchman
who
accompanied
the
young
millionaire
to
and
fro
but
edouard
refused
to
gossip
about
his
friend
and
patron
in
spite
of
his
success
the
young
sultan
of
had
not
forgotten
george
barclay
on
getting
more
in
touch
with
civilisation
and
its
ways
he
had
tried
to
find
out
the
name
of
the
man
who
was
responsible
for
the
death
of
his
supposed
father
it
was
not
an
easy
task
george
barclay
had
left
gambia
five
years
before
raoul
le
breton
set
about
his
investigations
there
had
been
a
succession
of
men
since
barclay
time
and
the
shooting
of
a
native
malefactor
was
not
a
matter
of
great
note
in
the
annals
of
a
government
however
eventually
le
breton
managed
to
establish
the
identity
of
the
man
he
looked
upon
as
his
father
murderer
but
to
trace
george
barclay
in
england
proved
an
even
more
difficult
task
than
tracing
him
in
africa
the
englishman
had
not
stopped
long
in
his
country
in
search
of
forgetfulness
he
had
gone
from
one
place
to
another
holding
posts
in
various
parts
of
the
empire
the
sultan
casim
ammeh
was
when
he
heard
that
barclay
was
in
the
malay
straits
the
news
came
to
him
in
paris
just
when
he
was
setting
out
for
an
evening
amusement
in
company
with
edouard
the
letter
was
brought
to
him
as
he
stood
in
opera
hat
in
hand
in
his
own
private
at
the
palatial
hotel
he
always
patronised
when
in
paris
on
perusing
it
he
turned
to
his
companion
and
said
with
an
air
of
savage
triumph
well
edouard
i
managed
to
trace
my
man
at
last
the
doctor
knew
who
the
man
in
question
was
for
he
edouard
was
the
sultan
casim
one
confidant
rather
uneasily
he
glanced
at
his
patron
he
wished
the
young
man
would
be
content
with
money
and
the
many
joys
and
pleasures
it
could
buy
for
casim
ammeh
was
no
longer
a
strict
mohammedan
and
would
not
be
always
hankering
after
vengeance
a
vengeance
that
might
embroil
him
with
england
and
bring
his
wild
and
brilliant
career
to
an
abrupt
close
where
is
george
barclay
edouard
asked
uneasily
in
the
straits
settlements
the
doctor
experienced
a
feeling
of
intense
pleasure
on
hearing
barclay
was
in
so
remote
a
spot
it
be
difficult
for
you
to
get
hold
of
him
there
he
remarked
trying
to
keep
out
of
his
voice
the
relief
he
was
feeling
he
wo
stay
there
for
ever
i
waited
eleven
years
for
my
vengeance
i
can
go
on
waiting
a
little
longer
until
fate
thinks
well
to
place
him
in
a
more
accessible
position
with
a
savage
expression
le
breton
turned
to
a
desk
sitting
down
he
wrote
to
his
agents
telling
them
to
keep
him
informed
of
george
barclay
movements
part
ii
chapter
i
the
harem
in
the
palace
of
led
into
a
large
hall
with
carved
doors
and
tiny
arabesque
windows
fretted
and
scrolled
with
no
one
spot
big
enough
to
squeeze
more
than
a
hand
through
generally
speaking
the
women
of
the
harem
preferred
the
large
hall
where
they
could
gossip
among
themselves
and
with
their
attendant
women
to
the
little
rooms
that
were
their
own
private
quarters
but
there
was
one
special
apartment
that
they
all
in
turn
had
striven
after
and
in
turn
had
failed
to
attain
no
one
in
the
harem
had
seen
the
room
except
old
sara
and
she
had
plenty
of
tales
to
tell
about
its
magnificence
it
was
a
big
gilded
chamber
with
a
ceiling
like
the
sky
on
a
desert
night
and
great
golden
jewelled
lamps
there
was
a
wonderful
bathroom
a
fretted
gallery
that
gave
a
wide
view
of
the
desert
a
walled
garden
full
of
roses
and
above
all
a
door
that
led
into
the
sultan
private
suite
the
room
had
had
no
occupant
since
the
days
of
the
sultan
mother
the
lady
annette
the
first
wife
and
favourite
of
his
father
and
sara
had
been
her
special
slave
and
attendant
it
could
be
reached
from
the
harem
at
one
point
behind
the
silken
curtains
a
narrow
stairway
led
upwards
and
ended
in
a
scented
sandalwood
door
but
the
door
was
always
locked
and
only
the
sultan
had
the
key
it
was
common
harem
gossip
that
in
that
room
he
would
place
the
one
among
his
slaves
whom
he
deigned
to
make
his
first
wife
although
the
law
allowed
him
four
and
as
many
slaves
as
he
fancied
so
far
he
had
no
legal
wife
it
was
strange
considering
he
was
nearly
thirty
but
in
many
ways
he
differed
from
all
the
previous
sultans
according
to
old
sara
it
was
because
his
mother
belonged
to
quite
another
race
and
had
come
from
a
land
as
remote
from
as
paradise
where
the
women
were
all
white
a
land
that
the
sultan
now
visited
yearly
for
that
land
he
was
starting
he
had
just
been
to
the
harem
to
say
farewell
to
the
girls
there
departing
with
promises
of
new
jewels
and
novelties
to
please
and
amuse
these
toys
of
his
on
his
return
and
now
he
lingered
with
his
newest
slave
and
favourite
rayma
the
arab
girl
he
had
bought
but
six
weeks
ago
illustration
he
had
come
to
the
harem
to
say
farewell
envious
glances
were
cast
towards
the
door
behind
which
the
sultan
casim
ammeh
and
his
new
slave
rayma
took
farewell
of
one
another
one
girl
more
than
the
others
watched
the
door
with
hurt
angry
jealous
eyes
she
was
about
with
a
full
figure
a
creamy
skin
a
profusion
of
long
black
curls
and
great
soft
languid
eyes
a
girl
of
the
true
odalesque
type
her
attire
was
scanty
a
red
silk
slip
draped
her
from
shoulder
to
knee
held
on
by
ribbon
straps
and
on
her
hands
and
wrists
and
neck
a
quantity
of
barbaric
jewelery
flashed
i
pray
to
allah
that
on
his
travels
our
sultan
will
find
some
woman
he
loves
better
than
rayma
she
said
spite
and
jealousy
in
her
soft
voice
no
i
do
pray
that
leonora
one
of
her
companions
remarked
for
took
him
from
and
what
am
i
now
like
you
a
scent
that
has
lost
its
savour
for
it
is
but
a
shred
of
love
that
the
lord
casim
has
now
for
me
no
i
pray
may
know
what
it
is
to
love
and
be
denied
for
too
easily
do
women
hearts
go
to
him
and
no
man
values
what
comes
to
him
cheaply
our
day
is
done
mine
and
yours
leonora
as
rayma
will
be
when
another
woman
takes
his
fancy
no
pray
as
i
do
that
he
may
love
a
woman
who
has
no
desire
for
him
who
spurns
his
love
a
woman
whose
people
will
not
sell
her
who
is
no
slave
put
up
for
auction
as
we
were
may
his
heart
ache
as
mine
has
ached
may
passion
keep
him
sleepless
with
empty
arms
and
craving
desire
may
love
prove
to
him
a
mirage
that
he
can
see
yet
never
grasp
unconscious
of
these
wishes
the
sultan
casim
ammeh
and
the
slave
girl
rayma
lingered
together
behind
closed
doors
the
moon
shone
into
the
little
apartment
showing
a
big
man
in
a
white
burnoose
and
at
his
side
a
girl
lay
looking
at
him
with
tearful
eyes
she
was
about
seventeen
with
an
amber
skin
and
a
cloud
of
straight
black
hair
that
reached
to
her
heels
a
cloud
out
from
which
looked
a
little
oval
face
with
great
black
eyes
and
a
small
red
mouth
a
perfect
type
of
arab
beauty
my
lord
casim
beloved
my
heart
breaks
at
the
thought
of
your
going
she
said
tearfully
smilingly
he
watched
her
caressing
her
in
an
indulgent
fashion
but
my
desert
flower
i
shall
come
back
again
but
it
is
so
far
and
in
that
paris
there
are
so
many
women
i
know
because
sara
has
told
me
and
all
their
arms
will
be
stretched
out
to
keep
you
there
no
arms
have
kept
me
there
for
longer
than
three
months
he
replied
and
mine
mine
are
not
strong
enough
to
keep
you
here
she
sobbed
he
drew
the
sobbing
little
beauty
into
his
embrace
and
kissed
her
face
tell
me
my
jewel
what
favour
can
i
grant
you
before
i
go
i
want
nothing
but
just
to
rest
upon
your
heart
for
ever
with
a
tender
hand
he
stroked
her
long
black
hair
and
tried
to
soothe
away
the
tears
flattering
tears
resulting
from
his
coming
departure
do
go
to
paris
casim
beloved
she
whispered
stay
in
paris
is
so
far
and
i
am
so
ignorant
of
all
outside
of
the
desert
ignorant
of
everything
except
love
and
you
think
my
lord
only
six
weeks
have
we
been
together
and
now
you
would
go
only
six
weeks
since
my
father
brought
me
from
the
desert
to
sell
me
to
the
sultan
casim
ammeh
how
afraid
i
was
until
i
saw
you
and
then
i
was
afraid
i
might
not
find
favour
in
your
sight
for
my
heart
was
yours
the
moment
our
eyes
met
only
six
weeks
ago
casim
do
go
she
implored
stay
with
me
for
my
heart
is
breaking
little
one
there
is
business
as
well
as
love
he
said
gently
i
think
of
nothing
but
love
love
is
quite
enough
for
any
girl
to
think
of
and
those
women
in
paris
do
they
think
only
of
love
no
they
think
of
money
as
well
that
why
i
prefer
you
she
slipped
her
slim
arms
about
his
neck
pressing
her
slight
form
against
him
kissing
him
passionately
let
me
live
in
the
gilded
chamber
until
you
come
back
she
whispered
and
then
i
should
feel
the
most
honoured
among
your
slaves
however
he
avoided
this
suggestion
we
see
about
that
when
i
return
he
answered
with
an
amused
indulgent
air
then
he
held
the
girl
closer
now
before
i
go
rayma
is
there
nothing
you
want
nothing
i
can
do
for
you
there
is
one
thing
my
sultan
sell
leonora
i
hate
her
she
a
great
fat
toad
always
plotting
and
planning
to
steal
your
heart
from
me
i
could
do
that
i
not
quite
like
your
desert
men
remember
i
ca
sell
a
woman
who
has
once
pleased
me
but
on
my
return
find
her
a
nice
husband
if
that
will
satisfy
you
there
was
a
note
in
his
voice
that
brooked
no
argument
and
the
girl
reared
for
the
harem
was
quick
to
notice
it
she
gave
a
sharp
glance
at
her
owner
it
seemed
that
a
man
she
did
not
know
stood
behind
her
sultan
indulgent
master
as
he
had
proved
a
man
she
had
no
hold
over
chapter
ii
in
one
of
the
hotels
in
the
island
of
grand
canary
dinner
had
just
been
served
around
the
door
of
the
large
the
manager
the
head
waiter
and
several
underlings
hovered
with
an
air
of
awaiting
the
arrival
of
some
important
personage
presently
two
people
appeared
in
the
doorway
one
was
a
woman
with
grey
hair
and
a
prim
expression
she
was
wearing
a
plain
black
silk
evening
dress
and
she
had
the
look
of
a
retired
governess
her
companion
was
of
quite
another
type
she
was
a
slender
graceful
girl
of
medium
height
with
a
mop
of
short
golden
curls
dancing
round
a
small
frank
face
that
gave
her
the
look
of
some
lovely
delicate
schoolboy
she
wore
a
simple
white
silk
frock
and
her
only
mark
of
wealth
was
a
large
diamond
hanging
from
a
thin
platinum
chain
about
her
slender
neck
a
gem
in
itself
worth
a
fortune
evidently
she
was
the
personage
expected
as
she
appeared
the
manager
went
forward
to
meet
her
she
smiled
at
him
in
a
friendly
affable
manner
with
him
at
her
side
she
and
her
companion
went
up
the
big
room
towards
a
specially
reserved
table
the
and
a
little
group
of
others
following
behind
as
she
came
up
the
room
a
man
seated
at
one
of
the
tables
in
the
center
of
the
room
said
to
his
neighbour
who
is
that
girl
the
whole
hotel
is
falling
over
itself
to
wait
on
her
the
speaker
was
a
short
man
with
a
red
face
and
fishy
eyes
that
pansy
langham
the
millionairess
his
neighbour
replied
she
came
over
in
her
yacht
from
teneriffe
this
afternoon
barclay
her
name
was
before
she
came
into
her
money
a
millionaire
is
she
that
the
second
one
of
the
species
in
grand
canary
then
for
there
a
french
millionaire
staying
in
a
villa
at
the
back
here
le
breton
his
name
is
but
what
brought
the
girl
to
these
parts
there
not
much
here
to
attract
a
woman
with
money
she
here
for
her
health
i
believe
not
lungs
surely
she
looks
healthy
enough
no
she
had
an
accident
about
a
couple
of
months
ago
some
horse
mauled
her
horribly
all
but
killed
her
i
remember
reading
about
the
case
in
the
papers
they
say
she
a
very
decent
sort
in
spite
of
her
millions
gives
an
awful
lot
away
in
charity
as
the
girl
approached
the
table
the
man
screwed
an
eyeglass
into
one
fishy
eye
and
surveyed
her
from
head
to
foot
she
not
bad
looking
he
said
in
a
condescending
manner
as
if
it
were
his
prerogative
to
criticise
every
woman
who
crossed
his
horizon
but
she
not
a
patch
on
the
woman
in
the
villa
at
the
back
here
now
she
what
i
call
a
beauty
he
did
not
trouble
to
lower
his
voice
and
his
words
reached
pansy
she
glanced
in
his
direction
and
wrinkled
her
pretty
nose
as
if
she
were
smelling
a
bad
smell
and
with
no
more
notice
than
that
she
passed
on
to
her
own
table
chapter
iii
just
off
the
main
road
between
the
port
and
the
city
of
las
palmas
grand
canary
a
villa
stood
it
was
situated
on
a
hill
a
white
building
set
in
a
pleasant
garden
long
windows
opened
on
a
lawn
surrounded
by
trees
out
from
one
of
the
windows
a
flood
of
light
streamed
and
mingled
with
the
silver
of
the
night
the
apartment
it
came
from
was
elaborately
furnished
in
an
ornate
french
style
with
gilded
furniture
bevelled
mirrors
and
chairs
and
lounges
on
one
of
the
latter
a
woman
lolled
back
amongst
an
array
of
soft
cushions
she
was
big
and
with
a
skin
a
mass
of
flaming
red
hair
and
eyes
green
as
the
emerald
necklace
she
wore
she
had
on
an
extremely
black
satin
dress
that
suited
her
style
and
colouring
and
she
made
a
striking
if
somewhat
bizarre
picture
but
attractive
and
unique
as
she
looked
the
man
sitting
with
her
appeared
more
interested
in
the
view
from
the
window
than
in
his
companion
from
there
a
glint
of
moonlit
sea
showed
between
the
vaguely
moving
trees
a
peaceful
stretch
that
spread
away
to
the
purple
misty
horizon
he
was
a
big
man
of
about
thirty
well
groomed
and
handsome
with
smooth
black
hair
moustache
and
dark
smouldering
eyes
that
had
a
latent
searching
look
at
the
back
of
them
he
was
in
evening
attire
with
black
pearl
studs
in
his
pleated
dress
shirt
for
some
time
the
two
had
been
sitting
in
silence
the
man
gaze
on
the
sea
the
woman
on
the
man
in
a
hungry
anxious
manner
you
got
one
of
your
restless
moods
on
raoul
she
said
presently
i
get
them
frequently
nowadays
nothing
ever
satisfies
me
for
long
she
smiled
at
him
a
soft
slow
smile
yet
i
have
satisfied
you
longer
than
most
for
you
are
still
here
with
me
it
not
you
so
much
lucille
as
business
that
keeps
me
here
i
believe
you
have
no
heart
at
all
she
cried
a
catch
of
pain
in
her
voice
you
look
upon
all
women
as
animals
you
are
a
most
handsome
animal
you
must
agree
he
replied
you
talk
as
if
you
bought
me
i
do
know
that
i
ever
put
it
quite
so
crudely
as
that
put
it
as
crudely
as
you
like
she
cried
in
a
sudden
gust
of
temper
you
have
taken
all
from
me
and
given
me
nothing
in
return
he
made
no
reply
in
a
slightly
amused
manner
his
glance
rested
on
her
emerald
necklace
you
may
look
she
went
on
passionately
but
i
want
more
than
gifts
i
want
love
not
just
to
be
the
creature
of
your
passions
then
you
want
too
much
there
no
such
thing
as
love
between
men
and
women
there
only
passion
you
are
cruel
she
moaned
cruel
merely
because
i
refuse
to
be
enslaved
by
any
one
woman
eaten
up
in
mind
and
body
and
soul
as
some
of
the
men
i
know
are
i
brought
up
to
look
upon
women
as
superior
beings
and
i
never
met
one
yet
to
make
me
want
to
change
my
sentiments
they
are
here
for
my
convenience
and
pleasure
and
nothing
more
there
was
silence
again
lucille
sighed
she
knew
she
had
no
hold
over
him
other
than
her
sex
and
never
had
had
heroics
temper
and
entreaties
had
no
effect
on
him
whatsoever
he
remained
always
unmoved
and
indifferent
with
a
shrug
she
picked
out
a
chocolate
from
a
large
box
at
her
side
then
she
changed
the
conversation
what
the
business
raoul
i
no
idea
you
had
any
here
i
thought
ours
was
a
pleasure
trip
purely
or
impurely
the
business
is
strictly
private
he
replied
a
savage
note
in
his
voice
a
month
before
on
leaving
paris
when
le
breton
had
asked
lucille
lemesurier
the
actress
to
accompany
him
on
his
yacht
and
spend
a
week
or
so
in
grand
canary
it
had
been
for
pleasure
solely
but
a
few
days
ago
a
letter
had
reached
him
a
letter
to
the
effect
that
his
enemy
now
sir
george
barclay
had
been
appointed
governor
of
gambia
the
sultan
casim
ammeh
was
waiting
in
grand
canary
until
certain
that
his
man
was
for
his
new
post
chapter
iv
on
the
balcony
of
her
bedroom
pansy
langham
stood
slim
and
in
a
suit
of
silk
pyjamas
beneath
the
hotel
grounds
spread
running
down
to
the
shore
beyond
the
sea
stretched
a
silver
mirror
away
to
the
sparkling
frosty
mist
of
the
horizon
in
the
milky
sky
the
moon
soared
a
molten
globe
touching
the
drooping
palms
and
making
their
quivering
fronds
look
like
silver
fountains
a
little
line
of
waves
lapped
murmurously
on
the
shore
in
a
running
ridge
of
white
fire
the
stone
wall
edging
the
garden
was
turned
into
marble
here
and
there
across
the
beach
the
taller
trees
threw
thick
ebony
shadows
on
the
whole
expanse
of
silvered
sea
only
one
mark
showed
like
a
black
dot
in
the
distance
pansy
had
seen
the
mark
when
it
had
been
much
nearer
the
shore
a
dark
head
he
had
swum
out
and
out
away
into
the
mist
and
moonlight
it
was
long
after
midnight
in
the
whole
white
world
there
was
no
sign
of
life
except
that
dark
head
and
the
girl
on
the
balcony
who
was
watching
the
swimmer
the
black
dot
grew
bigger
as
with
powerful
overhand
strokes
the
man
made
his
way
shorewards
when
about
two
hundred
yards
away
from
the
beach
the
strong
ease
of
his
limbs
altered
suddenly
they
grew
contorted
he
threw
up
his
arms
and
a
moment
later
vanished
completely
pansy
gave
a
quick
gasp
of
alarm
but
the
man
appeared
again
trying
to
float
as
a
swimmer
does
when
cramps
seize
him
in
order
to
get
air
between
the
spasms
that
send
him
writhing
under
water
a
hopeless
task
usually
unless
aid
is
quickly
forthcoming
for
just
one
second
pansy
watched
with
horror
and
distress
on
her
face
then
she
turned
sharply
and
vanished
into
her
bedroom
a
moment
or
so
later
she
was
out
of
the
hotel
and
running
swiftly
through
the
silent
garden
towards
the
shore
to
le
breton
out
there
with
the
water
choking
his
powerful
lungs
gasping
and
fighting
for
his
life
against
a
death
that
only
his
own
nerve
and
wit
kept
at
bay
that
struggle
seemed
an
eternity
all
at
once
he
was
caught
and
held
from
behind
just
on
the
surface
of
the
water
a
slight
support
but
sufficient
to
keep
him
from
going
under
when
the
spasms
were
on
unlike
the
average
swimmer
in
difficulties
he
did
not
snatch
at
his
unseen
rescuer
for
all
his
dire
straits
he
had
the
presence
of
mind
to
let
his
preserver
alone
for
another
ten
minutes
or
more
the
attack
lasted
then
his
muscles
unknotted
and
strength
came
back
to
his
limbs
he
turned
himself
over
to
see
who
had
come
to
his
aid
out
of
the
misty
moonlit
sea
a
young
face
looked
at
him
from
under
a
mop
of
short
curls
you
did
come
a
moment
too
soon
my
boy
he
said
there
was
a
tired
look
about
pansy
but
that
did
not
prevent
her
dimpling
in
an
effort
not
to
smile
and
to
hide
her
mirth
she
dived
suddenly
and
struck
out
towards
the
land
le
breton
struck
out
too
he
reached
the
shore
first
pansy
however
did
not
go
in
his
direction
she
turned
off
and
landed
where
the
shadows
were
the
thickest
from
where
the
man
stood
he
saw
what
looked
to
be
a
slim
fragile
boy
of
about
fourteen
who
staggered
slightly
with
fatigue
as
he
made
towards
the
most
shadowed
pair
of
steps
leading
into
the
hotel
grounds
quickly
le
breton
went
towards
his
rescuer
with
the
idea
of
lending
a
hand
for
it
looked
as
if
the
boy
were
thoroughly
worn
out
by
the
time
he
reached
her
pansy
was
leaning
against
the
wall
under
cover
of
the
thickest
shadows
i
afraid
you
yourself
on
my
account
he
said
in
a
solicitous
way
i
do
usually
get
knocked
out
so
quickly
she
replied
but
i
had
a
nasty
accident
some
weeks
ago
and
i
not
quite
recovered
yet
the
answer
was
in
french
as
fluent
and
parisian
as
his
own
you
must
let
me
help
you
back
to
the
hotel
he
said
oh
no
it
not
necessary
i
shall
be
all
right
in
a
moment
what
you
need
my
boy
is
a
dose
of
brandy
he
remarked
that
would
soon
put
you
right
pansy
put
her
hand
to
her
mouth
to
hide
her
smiles
her
short
hair
pyjamas
and
the
shadows
had
deceived
him
completely
it
would
be
a
bad
idea
she
replied
but
i
do
happen
to
have
any
ring
for
some
then
when
you
get
back
to
the
hotel
i
would
dream
of
disturbing
people
at
this
hour
of
the
night
she
said
in
an
indignant
tone
of
voice
what
else
are
the
servants
there
for
he
asked
in
a
surprised
and
peremptory
way
they
not
there
for
me
to
root
out
of
bed
at
two
in
the
morning
he
laughed
in
an
amused
manner
i
not
so
considerate
of
menials
as
you
appear
to
be
but
tell
me
the
number
of
your
room
and
i
bring
you
some
there
was
a
brief
pause
out
from
the
shadows
pansy
scanned
the
man
she
could
not
see
much
except
that
he
was
big
and
of
splendid
proportions
but
he
had
a
air
and
his
deep
voice
if
imperious
was
pleasant
and
cultured
then
her
eyes
started
to
sparkle
with
mischief
my
room
is
number
three
on
the
first
floor
she
said
do
knock
come
straight
in
i
leave
the
door
ajar
i
do
want
to
disturb
my
neighbours
with
my
midnight
prowls
very
well
i
be
there
in
ten
minutes
or
so
they
parted
company
le
breton
going
along
the
shore
pansy
up
the
shadowed
steps
on
reaching
her
own
room
she
switched
on
the
light
slipping
off
her
sodden
garments
she
dried
herself
quickly
and
put
on
a
silk
nightgown
embroidered
with
purple
pansies
giving
a
quick
vigorous
rub
to
her
curls
she
opened
the
door
an
inch
or
so
then
she
skipped
into
bed
and
sat
there
and
delighted
with
the
surprise
she
had
prepared
for
the
man
unaware
of
what
was
in
store
for
him
le
breton
returned
to
the
hotel
knowing
the
place
well
he
made
his
way
noiselessly
along
the
dim
deserted
corridor
towards
a
door
that
stood
slightly
ajar
letting
out
a
sharp
knife
of
light
he
was
in
shirt
and
trousers
and
in
his
hand
he
carried
a
small
jewelled
flask
without
any
preamble
he
went
into
the
room
the
apartment
he
entered
was
a
sumptuous
one
to
average
eyes
the
best
the
hotel
boasted
on
the
wide
was
a
litter
of
silver
toilet
appointments
each
with
a
pansy
in
purple
enamel
on
it
le
breton
did
not
give
the
room
a
glance
he
had
eyes
for
nothing
but
the
figure
sitting
up
in
bed
a
figure
no
longer
in
pyjamas
they
lay
in
a
wet
heap
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
but
in
a
pretty
nightgown
and
from
beneath
a
flood
of
golden
curls
wide
purple
eyes
looked
at
him
sparkling
with
innocent
mischief
it
was
no
boy
who
had
come
to
his
assistance
but
a
girl
a
lovely
girl
with
a
full
perfect
mouth
vividly
red
a
skin
and
cheeks
where
roses
bloomed
he
backed
slightly
and
locked
the
door
as
if
the
situation
were
one
he
was
quite
accustomed
to
and
equal
to
dealing
with
there
no
need
to
lock
the
door
pansy
said
it
on
your
account
not
mine
a
little
incident
of
this
sort
damage
my
reputation
i
forgotten
about
my
reputation
she
said
a
note
of
concern
in
her
voice
i
only
thought
about
giving
you
a
surprise
it
is
a
most
delightful
one
too
in
fact
i
do
think
i
ever
experienced
anything
quite
so
delightful
and
unexpected
he
responded
drily
he
crossed
to
the
bed
and
stood
looking
at
the
girl
with
a
critical
appreciative
air
and
pansy
looked
at
him
with
candid
friendly
gaze
taking
stock
of
him
equally
he
struck
her
as
being
remarkably
but
his
expression
was
too
arrogant
his
mouth
too
hard
it
even
had
a
suspicion
of
cruelty
he
had
an
air
too
of
having
ridden
over
people
all
his
days
in
spite
of
his
appearance
there
was
a
suggestion
of
the
wild
about
him
as
if
he
had
never
been
properly
broken
in
there
was
a
brief
silence
as
the
two
surveyed
one
another
le
breton
was
the
first
to
speak
and
his
remark
was
of
a
critical
nature
why
do
you
wear
your
hair
short
it
would
suit
you
far
better
long
as
a
woman
hair
ought
to
be
i
like
it
short
it
less
trouble
there
was
a
note
in
her
voice
as
if
his
or
any
man
opinion
about
her
appearance
did
not
worry
her
in
the
least
an
air
of
thorough
independence
out
of
keeping
with
her
years
that
he
was
quick
to
notice
do
you
always
do
as
you
like
he
asked
always
it
an
excellent
habit
to
cultivate
and
one
cultivated
to
the
fullest
by
the
look
of
you
since
criticism
is
the
order
of
the
day
she
replied
le
breton
thought
of
the
desert
kingdom
he
had
ruled
with
undisputed
sway
for
sixteen
years
i
dare
say
i
do
as
i
like
more
than
most
people
you
come
across
he
answered
with
emphasis
pansy
dimpled
there
was
an
air
about
her
visitor
as
if
he
expected
and
were
accustomed
to
people
standing
in
awe
of
him
however
he
did
not
inspire
her
with
this
feeling
only
with
a
desire
to
tease
and
plague
him
he
was
so
big
and
masterful
looking
as
if
he
thought
himself
monarch
of
all
he
surveyed
even
herself
at
that
moment
are
you
in
the
habit
of
asking
strange
men
to
your
bedroom
he
asked
suddenly
if
i
remember
rightly
you
volunteered
to
come
and
now
i
here
what
am
i
supposed
to
do
to
be
surprised
to
give
me
a
drink
of
brandy
and
then
go
nicely
and
quietly
like
a
good
an
amused
look
crossed
le
breton
face
innocent
mischief
had
not
come
into
his
life
before
i
am
most
surprised
he
said
i
flattered
myself
i
could
tell
a
woman
anywhere
i
not
a
woman
not
until
next
year
so
that
must
account
for
your
deplorable
mistake
you
look
even
younger
than
twenty
are
you
english
or
american
why
ca
i
have
a
choice
of
being
either
french
or
russian
or
italian
or
spanish
or
german
only
an
english
or
an
american
girl
would
play
this
sort
of
a
trick
not
that
i
had
any
dealings
with
either
i
like
to
hear
you
were
american
what
wrong
with
being
english
i
dislike
and
despise
the
english
he
replied
a
latent
note
of
savagery
in
his
deep
voice
then
you
have
to
dislike
and
despise
me
because
i
one
of
them
pansy
stretched
out
her
hand
the
action
brought
into
view
a
network
of
disfiguring
red
ridges
and
scars
on
her
upper
arm
marring
an
otherwise
perfect
limb
please
give
me
a
drink
she
finished
the
excitement
of
the
surprise
she
had
prepared
was
dying
down
leaving
her
looking
what
she
really
was
worn
out
with
the
exertion
of
saving
him
crossing
to
the
le
breton
picked
up
a
glass
pouring
a
small
dose
of
brandy
into
it
he
added
the
requisite
water
and
brought
it
back
to
the
girl
then
he
seated
himself
on
the
bedside
watching
her
as
she
drank
it
what
a
nasty
scar
you
have
on
your
arm
he
remarked
is
if
any
flaw
on
such
perfection
annoyed
him
i
worse
scars
here
and
here
she
replied
touching
her
side
and
thigh
and
they
do
look
at
all
pretty
sultan
did
them
he
started
slightly
the
sultan
what
sultan
a
brown
sultan
a
very
nice
sultan
but
we
understand
one
another
now
le
breton
took
the
girl
arm
into
his
grip
with
the
light
firm
careful
touch
of
a
man
who
is
used
to
handling
women
they
the
marks
of
a
horse
teeth
he
remarked
after
a
brief
survey
with
an
air
of
relief
pansy
held
the
empty
glass
towards
him
thank
goodness
that
finished
now
with
your
permission
i
go
to
sleep
he
took
the
glass
placing
it
on
a
table
near
but
he
did
not
move
from
his
seat
on
the
bedside
you
must
tell
me
your
name
he
said
you
find
out
quite
soon
enough
without
my
telling
you
it
not
at
all
necessary
for
me
to
advertise
myself
nowadays
wo
you
tell
me
he
asked
in
a
cajoling
tone
pansy
shook
her
head
then
i
must
find
a
name
for
you
he
said
a
flower
name
would
suit
you
admirably
let
me
see
what
do
you
call
the
flower
in
english
he
hesitated
pansy
he
finished
after
a
moment
thought
but
why
specially
she
asked
smiling
at
him
why
not
lily
or
rose
or
may
since
i
to
be
given
a
stupid
flower
name
there
are
pansies
in
your
eyes
on
your
nightgown
on
the
appointments
of
your
on
your
handkerchief
here
with
a
deeply
bronzed
hand
he
touched
a
scrap
of
embroidered
muslin
that
peeped
out
from
beneath
her
pillow
and
which
had
a
pansy
worked
on
it
in
one
corner
pansy
laughed
amused
at
his
perception
now
i
too
tired
to
entertain
you
any
longer
she
said
good
night
and
thank
you
for
bringing
the
brandy
le
breton
was
not
accustomed
to
being
dismissed
when
he
was
prepared
to
stay
are
you
really
anxious
to
get
rid
of
me
he
asked
most
anxious
i
dying
to
go
to
sleep
in
a
reluctant
manner
he
got
to
his
feet
stooping
over
the
bed
he
gave
a
caressing
pat
to
the
tired
small
face
good
night
pansy
little
flower
he
said
softly
i
go
if
you
really
want
me
to
but
i
not
in
the
habit
of
going
unless
want
to
what
an
autocrat
you
sound
and
please
do
forget
my
reputation
i
ca
afford
to
lose
it
so
early
in
life
there
was
anxiety
in
the
girl
voice
for
all
her
light
tone
your
reputation
will
be
quite
safe
with
me
he
said
he
stood
for
a
moment
watching
her
an
amused
expression
lurking
in
his
dark
fiery
eyes
then
he
turned
and
switching
off
the
light
went
noiselessly
from
the
room
it
was
not
until
he
had
gone
that
pansy
recollected
that
he
had
touched
her
twice
and
she
had
not
minded
or
reproved
him
and
usually
she
very
strongly
resented
being
touched
by
men
and
it
was
not
until
le
breton
reached
his
villa
that
he
remembered
the
girl
had
not
even
troubled
to
ask
his
name
in
fact
once
the
trick
had
been
played
her
only
desire
had
been
to
get
him
out
of
the
room
chapter
v
in
one
of
the
private
of
the
hotel
miss
grainger
was
lolling
back
in
a
comfortable
wicker
chair
reading
a
newspaper
the
door
opening
made
her
look
round
a
slim
boyish
figure
entered
the
room
clad
in
a
white
riding
suit
the
neatest
of
brown
boots
and
leggings
and
a
white
felt
hat
pulled
well
on
to
a
mop
of
curls
you
late
starting
this
morning
pansy
i
am
but
last
night
i
saved
a
man
life
saved
a
man
life
really
my
dear
what
a
way
you
have
of
springing
surprises
on
one
teasingly
pansy
glanced
at
her
old
governess
miss
grainger
i
must
remind
you
that
surprises
is
slang
miss
grainger
ignored
the
reprimand
but
what
man
did
you
save
and
how
did
you
save
him
she
asked
in
a
slightly
bewildered
manner
i
forgot
to
ask
his
name
i
fished
him
out
of
the
sea
he
had
cramps
but
he
might
have
dragged
you
under
her
companion
said
in
a
horrified
voice
i
should
have
thought
that
last
experience
of
yours
with
that
awful
horse
would
have
taught
you
not
to
go
diving
headlong
into
danger
sultan
is
awful
you
know
it
was
all
a
mistake
on
his
part
besides
nothing
will
keep
me
from
headlong
into
danger
as
you
call
it
when
i
see
things
being
hurt
it
all
part
of
my
silly
impetuous
nature
well
i
hope
the
man
was
grateful
he
never
even
thanked
me
such
gross
ingratitude
left
miss
grainger
aghast
my
dear
she
exclaimed
he
thought
i
was
a
boy
and
when
he
found
i
was
a
girl
he
was
too
astonished
to
remember
his
manners
pansy
explained
but
do
say
anything
about
it
to
anybody
you
know
i
hate
a
fuss
what
was
he
like
big
and
dark
and
awfully
with
an
arrogant
manner
he
badly
needed
taking
down
a
peg
or
two
quite
different
from
captain
cameron
miss
grainger
suggested
oh
quite
bob
a
kid
beside
him
there
was
a
brief
pause
miss
grainger
glanced
at
the
girl
do
you
know
pansy
i
sorry
for
captain
cameron
so
am
i
the
girl
replied
a
touch
of
distress
in
her
voice
but
my
sorrow
refuses
to
blossom
into
love
he
a
very
good
sort
i
know
but
then
i
not
given
to
falling
in
love
some
day
you
find
yourself
in
love
before
you
know
it
pansy
smiled
at
her
old
governess
in
a
merry
fashion
what
a
persistent
bird
of
you
are
she
said
then
she
glanced
at
the
clock
now
i
off
i
sha
be
back
for
lunch
she
finished
she
went
leaving
miss
grainger
with
the
feeling
of
a
fresh
sweet
breeze
having
been
wafted
through
the
room
chapter
vi
in
the
large
patio
of
the
hotel
le
breton
sat
sipping
coffee
as
he
went
through
the
newspapers
solicitous
waiters
had
placed
on
a
table
at
his
elbow
it
was
not
often
he
came
to
the
hotel
but
when
he
did
the
whole
staff
was
at
his
disposal
for
he
scattered
largess
with
a
liberal
hand
he
had
lunched
there
his
gaze
wandering
over
the
crowded
as
if
in
search
of
someone
and
afterwards
he
had
stayed
on
it
was
now
about
three
in
the
afternoon
an
hour
when
the
patio
was
practically
deserted
as
he
sat
there
reading
pansy
entered
the
big
hall
still
in
breeches
and
leggings
just
as
she
had
returned
from
her
ride
she
would
have
passed
through
the
patio
without
coming
within
his
vision
except
that
something
about
the
smooth
black
head
was
familiar
so
she
changed
her
route
and
went
in
le
breton
direction
instead
have
you
gotten
over
your
disappointment
she
asked
in
an
unperturbed
manner
he
looked
round
then
he
got
to
his
feet
leisurely
surveying
the
slim
boyish
figure
with
disapproval
pansy
stood
with
her
hands
deep
in
her
pockets
smiling
at
him
a
smile
that
deepened
under
his
lack
of
appreciation
of
her
attire
what
disappointment
he
asked
of
finding
i
was
a
girl
you
had
to
be
polite
to
instead
of
a
boy
you
could
bully
i
inclined
to
go
back
to
my
first
impression
he
said
do
you
like
my
decidedly
i
do
not
why
do
you
wear
something
feminine
not
go
about
masquerading
as
a
man
adverse
criticism
rarely
came
pansy
way
she
laughed
what
a
back
number
you
are
all
women
ride
in
breeches
nowadays
but
since
you
do
approve
of
me
come
along
and
see
if
you
like
sultan
any
better
you
were
most
interested
in
his
mark
and
seal
there
was
an
air
about
her
as
if
she
never
expected
to
be
gainsaid
if
she
felt
like
favouring
a
man
for
she
turned
at
once
and
led
the
way
towards
the
main
entrance
picking
up
his
hat
le
breton
followed
once
outside
he
said
i
not
yet
thanked
you
for
saving
my
life
i
could
do
less
than
lend
a
hand
she
replied
with
a
casual
air
it
was
a
risky
thing
to
do
i
might
have
dragged
you
under
well
you
did
and
we
neither
of
us
any
the
worse
for
the
little
adventure
i
hope
we
shall
be
all
the
better
that
we
shall
be
excellent
friends
he
replied
then
he
drew
a
leather
case
from
his
pocket
and
held
it
towards
her
i
brought
you
a
little
memento
he
finished
with
inquisitive
hands
pansy
took
the
case
and
snapped
it
open
inside
was
a
string
of
pearls
worth
at
least
he
watched
the
girl
as
she
opened
the
case
but
none
of
the
coos
of
delight
and
surprise
at
his
generosity
that
he
expected
and
was
accustomed
to
under
such
circumstances
were
forthcoming
instead
she
closed
the
case
and
handed
it
back
to
him
it
very
pretty
and
very
kind
of
you
to
think
of
it
she
said
but
i
could
keep
it
to
have
his
gift
thrust
back
on
him
was
the
last
thing
le
breton
was
prepared
for
or
desired
why
not
he
asked
abruptly
i
never
take
presents
from
men
but
i
appreciate
your
kindness
all
the
same
he
glanced
at
her
a
peculiar
look
at
the
back
of
his
eyes
to
get
off
the
topic
pansy
hurried
forward
from
a
building
close
at
hand
there
came
a
gentle
whinny
that
sultan
she
remarked
he
hears
me
coming
when
the
stables
came
into
view
over
the
open
door
of
a
box
a
long
brown
head
and
neck
were
seen
stretched
towards
the
approaching
girl
i
going
to
let
him
out
she
said
but
you
must
come
too
close
he
hates
strangers
and
so
should
i
if
i
been
through
the
hell
been
through
le
breton
laughed
as
if
anyone
more
especially
the
slim
girl
with
him
telling
him
to
be
careful
of
anything
in
the
shape
of
a
horse
had
its
intensely
funny
side
as
pansy
opened
the
door
his
glance
ran
swiftly
over
the
animal
it
was
a
huge
gaunt
beast
a
chestnut
with
wild
roving
eyes
a
great
creature
well
on
in
years
and
undoubtedly
an
old
for
speed
was
written
all
over
it
and
on
it
too
were
scars
and
weals
that
spoke
of
past
pansy
kissed
its
soft
nose
and
patted
and
stroked
it
and
pulled
its
ears
and
the
great
animal
fawned
on
her
then
she
led
it
out
keeping
a
tight
grip
on
its
mane
for
it
bared
its
teeth
at
le
breton
and
stood
shivering
and
expectant
as
if
suspecting
every
man
hand
to
be
against
it
he
however
ignored
its
attentions
and
came
closer
but
it
swung
round
and
lashed
at
him
with
iron
heels
oh
do
be
careful
do
come
so
close
pansy
cried
in
spite
of
its
snarls
and
the
iron
hoofs
she
kept
her
grip
on
its
mane
but
neither
teeth
nor
hoofs
were
in
her
direction
ignoring
her
entreaties
le
breton
came
closer
all
the
time
talking
to
the
horse
gently
in
a
strange
language
the
animal
seemed
to
recognize
a
friend
it
quietened
down
suddenly
and
stretched
a
long
neck
in
his
direction
still
talking
he
patted
and
stroked
it
the
horse
submitted
to
his
attentions
and
before
many
moments
had
passed
was
rubbing
its
nose
against
him
all
interest
pansy
watched
the
two
make
friends
what
are
you
saying
to
him
she
asked
usually
he
wo
let
a
stranger
near
him
i
was
talking
to
him
in
the
language
all
understand
arabic
he
replied
but
how
did
you
come
by
such
a
brute
the
animal
was
of
the
type
only
the
most
hardened
of
could
handle
the
very
last
horse
for
a
girl
to
ride
i
dropped
across
him
quite
by
accident
le
breton
thought
of
the
scars
he
had
seen
on
the
girl
arm
and
he
had
heard
there
were
others
and
worse
beyond
his
view
i
should
say
it
was
accident
he
remarked
drily
i
like
to
hear
the
story
pansy
patted
the
big
horse
fondly
we
met
in
a
london
slum
she
said
i
happened
to
be
passing
a
stable
yard
when
i
heard
a
noise
like
a
horse
being
hurt
or
frightened
and
men
laughing
so
i
opened
the
gate
and
went
in
there
was
poor
old
sultan
tied
up
in
one
corner
and
half
a
dozen
roughs
baiting
him
all
the
time
taking
good
care
not
to
get
within
his
reach
for
he
was
almost
mad
with
terror
and
rage
and
i
told
them
what
i
thought
and
in
the
telling
i
got
too
close
to
sultan
and
he
grabbed
me
by
the
arm
in
ten
minutes
he
had
made
such
a
mess
of
me
that
it
took
a
month
to
patch
me
up
and
the
men
were
such
cowards
that
they
never
tried
to
rescue
me
it
was
sultan
himself
who
seemed
to
realise
he
set
on
his
best
friend
for
he
stopped
chewing
me
and
stood
sniffing
at
me
and
let
me
crawl
away
and
i
remember
anything
more
until
i
found
myself
back
home
then
i
remembered
the
poor
horse
left
to
the
mercy
of
those
cruel
wretches
and
i
sent
someone
along
to
buy
him
and
take
him
away
from
his
awful
surroundings
it
was
so
obvious
he
had
known
better
days
although
he
had
sunk
right
down
to
dragging
some
east
end
coal
higgler
cart
the
first
time
i
was
allowed
out
i
went
to
his
paddock
and
had
a
look
at
him
and
i
sure
he
knew
me
he
stretched
his
long
neck
over
the
gate
and
sniffed
and
snuffed
at
me
and
seemed
quite
at
the
end
of
a
fortnight
i
was
on
his
back
and
now
i
take
him
everywhere
i
go
as
he
gets
worried
if
he
does
see
me
about
he
ca
believe
his
awful
days
are
over
unless
i
here
to
reassure
him
as
pansy
told
the
tale
she
leant
against
the
big
horse
and
she
told
it
as
if
her
own
hurts
were
nothing
and
you
took
him
into
your
favour
after
he
had
treated
you
so
abominably
le
breton
said
i
could
be
hard
on
him
for
what
was
the
result
of
his
awful
surroundings
you
are
very
magnanimous
pansy
smiled
you
forgive
me
for
not
accepting
that
pretty
necklace
wo
you
she
asked
some
day
when
we
know
each
other
better
you
honour
me
by
accepting
it
he
said
he
spoke
to
the
girl
now
as
if
she
were
his
equal
not
just
some
pretty
toy
he
happened
to
have
fancied
i
never
take
anything
from
men
except
perhaps
a
few
flowers
there
was
a
subtle
contempt
for
his
sex
in
her
voice
which
le
breton
was
quick
to
note
so
you
despise
men
not
that
exactly
but
i
had
rather
an
overdose
of
them
since
been
here
sultan
and
i
go
off
early
every
morning
usually
and
are
miles
away
before
there
are
any
men
about
to
bother
us
with
this
pansy
turned
and
led
the
horse
back
to
its
box
now
she
said
when
this
was
done
i
must
keep
you
and
i
glad
you
none
the
worse
for
last
night
again
le
breton
was
dismissed
when
he
would
have
lingered
and
on
this
second
meeting
she
still
had
not
troubled
to
ask
his
name
there
was
a
curious
glint
in
his
eyes
as
they
rested
on
the
slim
white
indifferent
figure
of
the
girl
who
was
making
her
way
back
to
the
hotel
without
a
further
glance
in
his
direction
chapter
vii
at
six
in
the
morning
the
road
that
joins
the
port
and
the
city
of
las
palmas
shows
very
little
sign
of
the
peaceful
english
invasion
it
is
given
over
to
the
islanders
to
peasant
women
with
baskets
of
produce
on
their
heads
to
men
driving
donkeys
laden
with
fruit
and
vegetables
and
creaking
bullock
carts
the
early
morning
was
pansy
favourite
time
the
world
was
a
place
of
dew
and
brightness
with
the
sun
glinting
gold
on
sandy
hills
and
air
that
sparkled
like
champagne
she
trotted
along
on
her
big
horse
towards
the
white
city
its
flat
roofs
low
houses
and
palms
giving
it
an
oriental
aspect
biding
through
the
town
she
crossed
a
wide
bridge
and
went
upwards
through
a
grove
of
palms
past
banana
gardens
into
a
deserted
world
with
a
blue
sky
overhead
and
an
endless
stretch
of
sea
behind
as
she
mounted
higher
the
hill
grew
and
great
ragged
eucalyptus
trees
stood
in
tatters
by
the
roadside
here
and
there
was
a
stunted
pine
the
deep
green
of
a
walnut
tree
a
clump
of
bamboo
a
palm
and
occasionally
a
great
patch
of
prickly
cacti
whose
flaming
flowers
stood
out
red
against
a
dazzling
day
she
rode
without
spurs
or
whip
when
necessary
urging
her
horse
with
hand
and
voice
only
a
village
was
reached
where
men
in
slouch
hats
and
blanket
cloaks
lounged
in
groups
smoking
and
gossiping
and
swarthy
women
with
bright
handkerchiefs
around
their
heads
stared
at
the
girl
astride
the
big
horse
in
the
dust
of
the
road
a
little
group
of
children
dragged
a
trio
of
unfortunate
lizards
along
by
strings
around
their
necks
and
screamed
with
delight
at
the
writhings
of
the
tortured
reptiles
the
sight
brought
a
look
of
distress
to
pansy
face
reining
in
her
horse
she
slipped
of
and
went
towards
the
group
in
indifferent
spanish
she
gave
a
brief
lecture
on
cruelty
there
was
a
sprinkling
of
small
coins
and
the
lizards
changed
owners
pansy
stooped
loosening
the
strings
from
their
soft
throats
she
picked
them
out
of
the
dust
they
were
pretty
harmless
little
things
each
about
eighteen
inches
long
and
bright
green
in
colour
that
hung
limp
in
her
gentle
hands
and
looked
at
her
with
tortured
eyes
holding
them
carefully
she
went
back
to
her
horse
and
with
the
reins
over
her
arm
made
her
way
through
the
village
once
well
out
of
sight
of
the
place
she
seated
herself
on
a
bank
at
the
side
of
the
road
and
laid
the
three
limp
little
forms
on
a
warm
flat
sunny
rock
then
she
tried
to
coax
them
back
to
life
and
their
normal
state
of
bright
friskiness
as
she
sat
rubbing
with
a
gentle
forefinger
their
soft
panting
throats
crooning
over
them
with
pitying
words
too
intent
on
her
task
to
notice
what
was
going
on
around
her
a
deep
voice
said
with
an
unexpectedness
that
made
her
jump
they
do
exactly
the
same
with
the
next
lizards
they
catch
she
looked
round
quickly
in
the
middle
of
the
road
mounted
on
a
huge
black
horse
was
the
man
whose
life
she
had
saved
pansy
gaze
rested
on
him
for
a
moment
before
she
replied
he
made
such
a
picture
on
the
black
horse
with
his
strong
sunburnt
face
and
khaki
riding
suit
the
most
perfect
combination
of
horse
and
man
she
had
ever
seen
i
know
they
will
she
said
but
still
i
done
my
best
for
these
three
do
you
always
try
to
do
your
best
for
everything
that
comes
your
way
pansy
he
asked
tenderly
only
a
few
privileged
people
are
allowed
to
call
me
she
said
tartly
what
else
can
i
call
you
since
you
refuse
to
tell
me
your
name
you
mean
to
say
you
have
found
out
yet
she
exclaimed
i
never
gossip
he
replied
in
a
haughty
tone
i
do
know
yours
she
answered
so
we
what
is
called
in
english
what
exactly
does
mean
i
do
know
much
english
as
pansy
petted
the
lizards
she
explained
the
meaning
of
the
word
during
the
explanation
one
of
her
protégés
recovered
and
darted
off
in
a
most
thankless
manner
into
a
crevice
in
the
rocks
my
name
is
le
breton
he
said
when
he
had
grasped
her
meaning
raoul
le
breton
pansy
stared
at
him
she
had
surprised
him
on
the
occasion
of
their
first
meeting
but
he
had
turned
the
tables
on
her
during
her
stay
in
teneriffe
she
had
heard
of
raoul
le
breton
he
was
a
french
millionaire
an
african
merchant
prince
so
rumour
said
she
had
had
a
feeling
that
he
had
followed
her
that
morning
and
she
was
inclined
to
be
angry
about
it
now
she
saw
that
if
he
sought
her
out
it
was
not
from
mercenary
motives
since
he
was
quite
as
wealthy
as
she
was
what
was
more
he
had
no
idea
who
she
was
i
always
interested
in
millionaires
she
said
a
mischievous
glint
in
her
eyes
all
women
are
he
responded
grimly
but
you
not
the
only
millionaire
in
the
islands
she
remarked
so
i
gathered
there
is
or
was
one
here
quite
recently
an
englishwoman
of
the
name
of
langham
i
detest
women
with
money
they
are
invariably
ugly
and
conceited
pansy
laughed
a
ripple
of
sheer
enjoyment
perhaps
their
independence
annoys
you
she
suggested
i
believe
you
what
is
known
as
the
type
with
that
her
attention
went
back
to
the
lizards
dismounting
le
breton
came
to
her
side
you
speak
french
remarkably
well
he
commented
as
the
moments
passed
and
no
notice
was
taken
of
him
i
was
educated
in
paris
she
glanced
at
him
her
eyes
brimming
with
mischief
and
as
she
glanced
another
of
her
protégés
frisked
thanklessly
away
would
you
like
to
know
my
name
she
asked
at
present
it
sufficient
that
you
are
ease
do
you
say
in
english
i
wish
i
could
ease
this
one
poor
little
beast
she
said
touching
the
remaining
lizard
but
i
fear
it
hurt
beyond
redemption
stooping
he
picked
up
the
little
reptile
and
examined
it
it
hung
limp
in
his
grasp
a
hopeless
case
the
best
thing
to
do
with
it
is
to
kill
it
he
commented
oh
i
could
she
said
quickly
but
it
appeared
he
could
he
went
some
distance
away
from
the
girl
and
placed
the
lizard
on
a
flat
rock
in
a
moment
he
had
ground
all
tortured
life
out
of
it
with
his
heel
thank
you
she
said
gratefully
i
knew
it
was
suffering
but
i
could
have
done
that
to
save
my
life
as
a
reward
will
you
come
and
have
breakfast
with
me
there
nothing
i
should
like
better
he
answered
pansy
got
to
her
feet
he
helped
her
to
mount
then
he
rode
at
her
side
up
the
hill
i
love
the
clear
heights
she
remarked
presently
i
do
know
much
about
them
the
miry
depths
are
more
in
my
line
he
replied
critically
she
surveyed
him
you
do
look
so
specially
muddy
no
what
do
i
look
like
to
you
he
asked
a
caressing
note
in
his
voice
very
proud
very
passionate
very
strong
and
as
if
you
could
be
cruel
then
i
ca
look
very
attractive
he
said
smiling
slightly
being
proud
is
all
right
so
long
as
it
makes
you
too
proud
to
do
mean
things
and
what
about
the
passionate
he
asked
since
you
making
excuses
for
me
i
do
know
anything
about
it
well
what
about
my
being
strong
then
i
do
like
men
unless
they
are
and
the
cruelty
i
hate
it
life
sometimes
combines
to
make
people
cruel
who
otherwise
might
not
be
he
remarked
as
if
unaccustomed
to
finding
excuses
for
himself
you
ca
judge
a
person
fairly
until
you
know
all
that
has
gone
to
form
their
character
pansy
patted
her
gaunt
steed
i
know
that
she
said
that
why
i
stuck
to
sultan
when
my
friends
tried
to
persuade
me
to
have
him
shot
there
a
lot
in
his
life
that
i
do
know
these
marks
tell
me
that
she
pointed
to
the
various
old
scars
on
the
animal
now
you
shall
see
what
sultan
can
do
she
went
on
i
race
you
to
the
farm
over
there
where
breakfast
is
waiting
she
finished
pointing
to
a
green
patch
away
in
the
distance
a
touch
of
her
spurless
heel
sent
the
gaunt
beast
flying
along
the
dusty
deserted
road
in
a
long
loping
gallop
that
grew
more
and
more
rapid
egged
on
by
the
sound
of
another
horse
persistently
at
his
heels
pansy
had
not
expected
that
her
escort
would
be
able
to
keep
up
with
her
no
horse
she
had
met
could
keep
pace
with
her
protégé
at
the
end
of
half
a
mile
she
had
been
prepared
to
rein
up
and
wait
for
le
breton
but
at
the
end
of
a
mile
he
was
a
length
behind
her
and
at
the
end
of
two
he
was
there
just
the
same
pansy
tired
before
either
the
man
or
the
horses
oh
she
panted
as
le
breton
drew
up
beside
her
i
was
trained
as
a
jockey
you
did
get
away
from
me
quite
so
easily
as
you
expected
he
remarked
with
curious
emphasis
i
did
know
there
was
a
horse
in
the
islands
to
touch
sultan
in
spite
of
his
years
this
horse
i
on
has
won
several
races
in
paris
and
you
challenged
me
pansy
without
pausing
to
consider
what
you
might
be
let
in
for
he
said
watching
her
in
a
fierce
fond
manner
i
always
leap
before
i
look
it
my
besetting
sin
she
replied
then
she
pointed
to
a
side
track
leading
to
a
low
building
half
mud
half
timber
that
the
way
to
my
farm
she
said
but
i
do
know
that
my
breakfast
will
appeal
to
millionaires
do
thrust
that
down
my
throat
just
now
he
answered
i
want
to
see
life
from
your
point
of
view
the
farm
they
were
approaching
was
a
tiny
place
with
a
spreading
garden
where
orange
and
fig
trees
grew
in
one
corner
a
little
stood
wreathed
with
red
roses
that
gave
a
wide
view
of
the
island
and
a
glimpse
of
the
sea
evidently
pansy
was
expected
a
coarse
white
cloth
was
spread
on
the
table
in
the
and
it
was
set
with
thick
crockery
and
forks
and
spoons
leaving
le
breton
to
attend
to
the
horses
she
made
her
way
to
the
tiny
homestead
to
announce
her
presence
and
the
fact
of
a
guest
then
she
passed
on
towards
the
tossing
her
hat
on
a
seat
she
sat
with
the
light
glinting
on
her
golden
curls
her
elbows
on
the
table
watching
the
scene
dreamily
in
a
frame
of
red
roses
this
vision
of
her
greeted
le
breton
as
he
turned
the
corner
bringing
a
hungry
glint
to
his
eyes
breakfast
proved
a
simple
repast
there
was
a
thick
jug
full
of
coffee
another
of
milk
a
large
omelet
a
dish
of
fruit
rolls
butter
and
honey
now
she
said
when
it
was
set
before
them
how
do
you
like
your
coffee
as
it
should
be
according
to
the
orientals
black
as
sin
hot
as
hell
sweet
as
love
he
finished
lingering
over
the
word
she
poured
his
out
and
handed
it
to
him
black
as
he
desired
i
can
get
on
very
well
without
either
the
sin
or
the
love
she
remarked
as
she
helped
herself
to
a
cup
that
was
mostly
milk
and
with
no
sugar
in
it
i
thought
all
girls
liked
sweet
things
and
lived
for
love
he
said
as
he
set
about
serving
the
omelet
there
a
lot
more
in
life
for
women
nowadays
than
love
being
in
love
is
a
woman
normal
condition
he
said
in
a
forcible
dogmatic
manner
pansy
smiled
i
always
thought
you
had
come
out
of
the
ark
and
now
i
sure
of
it
you
got
such
antiquated
early
victorian
ideas
about
women
they
must
wear
knickers
they
must
always
be
yearning
after
some
mere
male
very
flattering
to
him
i
sure
she
finished
wrinkling
a
disdainful
nose
le
breton
gaze
rested
on
the
vivid
beautiful
little
face
with
the
full
perfect
generous
mouth
telling
of
an
unselfish
disinterested
nature
that
would
love
swiftly
and
deeply
some
day
you
find
yourself
in
love
before
you
know
it
he
commented
so
other
people
have
said
and
it
makes
me
horribly
nervous
at
times
like
a
blind
man
walking
on
the
edge
of
a
precipice
so
long
as
you
fell
in
love
with
a
man
who
could
appreciate
you
it
would
be
all
right
a
man
sufficiently
versed
in
women
to
know
you
have
qualities
beyond
your
beauty
to
recommend
you
with
some
surprise
pansy
glanced
at
him
a
soft
heart
lay
beneath
her
light
manner
quite
half
her
income
was
spent
for
the
benefit
of
others
she
wondered
how
he
knew
about
these
qualities
considering
their
brief
acquaintance
and
she
wondered
too
why
she
was
sitting
there
discussing
love
with
him
a
subject
she
never
would
let
any
man
approach
if
it
could
be
avoided
she
put
it
down
to
the
fact
that
her
identity
was
unknown
to
him
and
she
could
talk
to
him
freely
knowing
her
millions
were
no
temptation
one
thing
she
said
mischievously
money
will
never
attract
me
i
no
expensive
tastes
i
like
views
and
flowers
and
sunsets
moons
and
stars
and
seas
and
sago
pudding
horses
and
chocolates
and
my
own
way
all
things
that
do
require
a
tremendous
income
there
was
a
brief
silence
in
a
calculating
manner
le
breton
watched
her
she
was
a
new
type
to
him
a
girl
who
could
not
be
approached
in
the
way
most
women
could
be
by
the
easy
route
of
costly
presents
the
air
was
heavy
with
the
scent
of
roses
in
the
distance
a
guitar
was
playing
a
throb
of
melody
faint
and
seductive
that
fed
the
craving
in
the
man
heart
pansy
glanced
at
him
how
quiet
you
are
all
at
once
what
are
you
thinking
about
ways
and
means
he
replied
smiling
slightly
i
thought
only
people
were
troubled
in
that
way
the
trouble
with
me
now
is
that
i
want
something
which
i
fear
ca
be
bought
with
money
what
an
unpleasant
position
for
a
millionaire
to
be
in
still
it
makes
you
your
limitations
as
an
old
governess
of
mine
used
to
say
she
paused
for
a
moment
watching
him
with
an
air
of
subtle
mockery
and
mr
le
breton
it
wo
do
you
any
harm
to
have
to
go
without
a
few
of
the
things
you
want
there
a
look
about
you
as
if
you
always
had
things
too
much
your
own
way
i
not
so
sure
yet
that
i
going
to
do
without
it
fortunately
i
have
two
other
courses
left
open
to
me
persuasion
and
power
he
replied
power
i
thought
that
was
the
prerogative
of
kings
le
breton
said
nothing
he
knew
if
this
english
girl
had
any
idea
who
he
was
she
would
not
be
sitting
there
talking
to
him
so
freely
although
he
was
the
sultan
of
in
the
eyes
of
her
nation
he
was
a
nigger
there
was
a
further
silence
which
pansy
broke
what
made
you
swim
out
all
those
miles
the
other
night
she
asked
i
get
moods
when
i
want
to
lose
the
earth
and
find
a
heaven
to
my
own
liking
what
sort
of
heaven
would
that
be
where
there
would
be
only
one
houri
and
she
a
houri
why
that
a
sort
of
mohammedan
evidently
le
breton
was
in
a
confessional
mood
for
he
said
nowadays
i
often
wonder
what
use
my
life
is
there
no
pleasure
in
it
except
perhaps
women
so
long
as
it
it
all
right
the
trouble
starts
when
it
comes
to
these
words
from
the
innocent
girl
lips
made
him
laugh
who
told
you
that
he
asked
captain
cameron
he
likes
to
pose
as
an
authority
on
such
subjects
and
who
is
captain
cameron
there
was
a
suspicion
of
jealousy
in
le
breton
voice
at
present
he
possessed
with
a
demon
of
tennis
but
when
the
devil
has
been
cast
out
he
my
father
secretary
and
how
can
the
devil
be
cast
out
there
no
really
permanent
cure
but
it
can
be
assuaged
if
he
meets
someone
who
can
beat
him
in
teneriffe
he
carried
all
before
him
and
he
coming
over
here
to
beat
all
the
local
champions
he
one
of
the
few
people
i
really
like
i
known
him
all
my
life
these
remarks
of
hers
had
the
effect
of
reducing
le
breton
to
silence
again
chapter
viii
in
the
library
of
the
villa
le
breton
sat
alone
the
hour
was
late
getting
on
to
midnight
he
was
stretched
in
a
deep
chair
smoking
his
gaze
fixed
on
a
desk
close
by
on
which
was
a
wide
shallow
crystal
bowl
full
of
water
where
half
a
dozen
purple
pansies
floated
as
he
sat
there
indulging
in
some
dream
of
his
own
a
door
opened
and
he
looked
round
sharply
by
no
means
pleased
at
being
roused
from
his
reverie
the
room
was
his
special
sanctum
no
one
was
supposed
to
enter
without
his
permission
in
the
doorway
lucille
stood
in
a
foamy
white
her
wealth
of
red
hair
in
two
thick
ropes
down
her
back
on
seeing
her
a
look
of
suppressed
annoyance
crossed
his
face
what
is
it
he
asked
in
a
none
too
cordial
tone
she
crossed
to
his
side
and
stood
looking
down
at
him
anxiously
what
has
happened
to
you
the
last
two
days
she
asked
happened
to
me
what
do
you
mean
you
been
so
very
indifferent
was
i
ever
particularly
effusive
she
laid
her
hand
on
his
sleeve
with
a
lingering
caressing
touch
i
see
nothing
of
you
now
except
at
meals
she
said
with
an
impatient
gesture
he
drew
his
arm
away
i
not
always
in
the
mood
for
women
he
said
coldly
perhaps
it
would
be
nearer
the
truth
if
you
said
some
other
woman
has
taken
your
fancy
she
suggested
there
was
no
reply
le
breton
got
to
his
feet
and
crossed
to
the
desk
standing
there
with
his
back
to
her
as
if
he
resented
her
presence
it
was
most
obvious
to
lucille
that
she
was
not
welcome
what
is
this
new
fancy
of
yours
like
she
asked
in
a
hurt
jealous
tone
he
made
no
answer
but
his
very
back
oozed
annoyance
what
her
price
raoul
she
asked
in
a
wild
manner
is
it
emeralds
or
pearls
or
diamonds
or
is
she
one
whose
price
is
above
rubies
he
faced
round
suddenly
anger
flashing
in
his
eyes
be
quiet
woman
he
said
savagely
she
laughed
hysterically
so
she
something
too
good
for
me
to
talk
about
is
she
does
she
know
of
all
your
gay
doings
in
paris
oh
you
women
he
ejaculated
contemptuously
can
you
never
learn
the
virtue
of
silence
in
an
angry
manner
he
went
from
the
room
leaving
lucille
in
possession
she
watched
him
until
the
door
closed
then
she
sank
down
into
the
chair
he
had
vacated
and
stayed
there
with
bowed
head
weeping
bitterly
chapter
ix
at
a
spot
about
ten
miles
away
from
las
palmas
there
are
some
orange
groves
stretch
upon
stretch
of
scented
trees
they
made
a
of
smooth
boughs
and
shiny
leaves
overhead
with
a
glint
of
blue
sky
here
and
there
the
ground
was
strewn
with
white
petals
and
clusters
of
white
blossoms
made
fragrant
the
gilded
greenness
a
glimpse
of
the
sea
could
be
had
and
the
waves
filled
the
air
with
a
constant
soft
distant
murmur
at
one
spot
in
the
scented
grove
preparations
had
been
made
for
an
elaborate
picnic
piles
of
soft
silk
cushions
were
set
upon
the
ground
on
a
cloth
of
finest
linen
was
spread
an
array
of
frail
china
and
heavy
silver
with
here
and
there
some
golden
dish
holding
dainties
two
impassive
men
with
lean
brown
faces
clad
in
flowing
white
robes
stood
near
beyond
all
view
of
the
feast
came
a
faint
rattle
of
pots
and
pans
and
a
little
wavering
column
of
smoke
rose
from
a
fire
where
breakfast
was
being
prepared
when
pansy
had
come
down
the
hotel
steps
for
her
usual
early
morning
ride
she
had
not
been
very
surprised
to
find
le
breton
there
waiting
for
her
she
had
had
a
wide
experience
of
men
and
their
ways
and
she
knew
what
she
called
the
symptoms
generally
the
symptoms
annoyed
her
she
felt
they
had
more
to
do
with
her
money
than
herself
but
le
case
was
different
she
knew
who
he
was
but
he
had
no
idea
of
her
identity
i
going
to
take
you
out
for
breakfast
this
time
he
said
on
seeing
her
where
are
we
going
she
asked
to
the
orange
groves
beyond
telde
they
had
ridden
through
the
white
city
and
then
on
skirting
the
coast
past
banana
plantations
cliffs
and
a
lava
bed
where
the
poisonous
euphorbia
grew
ten
to
twelve
feet
high
stiff
and
straight
like
gigantic
candelabras
i
was
thinking
about
you
last
night
pansy
remarked
once
between
their
canters
what
you
said
about
the
miry
depths
and
i
remember
having
read
somewhere
that
water
can
always
reach
to
the
level
it
rises
from
when
people
get
into
the
depths
they
should
remember
that
help
them
to
scramble
out
the
miry
depths
of
dissipation
into
which
he
occasionally
plunged
had
never
troubled
le
breton
in
the
least
he
was
not
actively
aware
that
they
did
now
although
he
hoped
that
pansy
would
not
get
to
hear
of
them
but
it
was
all
part
of
the
girl
nature
to
have
ready
the
helpful
hand
so
pansy
he
said
having
saved
my
body
you
now
after
my
soul
oh
no
i
not
a
missionary
but
if
you
like
people
there
no
harm
in
giving
them
a
word
in
season
he
brought
his
horse
closer
and
bent
towards
the
girl
so
you
like
me
he
said
in
a
caressing
tone
i
should
be
here
if
i
did
she
answered
candidly
and
what
if
i
say
i
like
he
asked
laughing
softly
i
should
say
it
very
nice
of
you
considering
you
know
nothing
at
all
about
me
i
can
see
you
are
beautiful
i
know
your
heart
is
kind
circumstances
have
shown
me
you
are
not
mercenary
what
more
could
i
wish
to
know
about
you
is
the
combination
enough
to
attract
any
man
considering
you
are
french
you
missed
the
vital
point
she
said
demurely
you
have
said
anything
about
a
no
man
in
his
senses
would
want
a
with
you
he
would
get
much
money
out
of
my
father
anyhow
she
said
a
poor
man
who
has
to
work
hard
for
his
living
and
i
love
him
better
than
anyone
in
the
whole
wide
world
i
like
to
meet
him
le
breton
remarked
so
you
will
if
you
behave
yourself
he
coming
out
here
very
soon
what
constitutes
behaving
myself
he
asked
people
have
never
complained
of
my
behaviour
so
far
pansy
knew
he
was
arrogant
and
overbearing
by
his
own
telling
she
guessed
he
was
inclined
to
be
wild
she
suspected
him
of
having
little
or
no
respect
for
women
although
he
had
been
unfailingly
courteous
to
her
i
might
complain
if
i
had
much
to
do
with
you
though
she
said
it
would
be
refreshing
to
say
the
least
he
remarked
with
a
slight
smile
hovering
on
his
lips
and
what
would
you
complain
of
especially
you
need
a
lot
of
reforming
in
quite
a
few
ways
tell
me
and
i
endeavour
to
mould
myself
according
to
your
ideals
he
said
with
laughter
you
know
you
very
well
pleased
with
yourself
as
you
are
but
i
even
better
pleased
with
you
pansy
he
answered
watching
her
with
glowing
gaze
this
pansy
knew
quite
well
to
get
off
the
topic
she
touched
her
horse
lightly
and
broke
into
a
canter
for
it
seemed
to
her
the
symptoms
were
coming
to
a
head
even
more
rapidly
than
she
had
expected
when
the
edge
of
the
orange
grove
was
reached
a
couple
of
men
came
forward
to
take
their
horses
dark
men
with
faces
lean
and
who
bowed
low
before
her
escort
with
the
utmost
servility
they
look
like
arabs
pansy
said
they
are
arabs
some
of
my
servants
from
africa
i
generally
have
half
a
dozen
with
me
it
seemed
to
pansy
the
whole
were
in
the
grove
ready
to
wait
on
her
no
sooner
was
she
settled
among
the
cushions
than
one
of
the
servants
placed
a
little
box
before
her
about
six
inches
long
and
four
wide
a
costly
trifle
made
of
beaten
gold
inlaid
with
flat
emeralds
and
rubies
is
it
pandora
box
she
asked
picking
it
up
and
examining
it
with
curiosity
it
and
the
contents
are
for
you
le
breton
replied
she
turned
the
tiny
golden
key
inside
three
purple
pansies
reposed
on
a
nest
of
green
moss
smiling
up
at
her
with
velvety
eyes
i
have
the
contents
she
said
the
box
you
can
keep
for
another
time
with
slim
white
fingers
she
picked
out
the
pansies
and
tucked
them
into
her
coat
still
only
a
few
flowers
pansy
he
said
annoyed
yet
pleased
that
her
friendship
was
disinterested
suggest
something
else
that
you
would
accept
breakfast
she
said
promptly
i
dying
of
hunger
a
sumptuous
feast
was
spread
for
her
benefit
served
in
gold
and
dishes
an
array
of
the
most
expensive
luxuries
if
le
breton
idea
had
been
to
impress
her
with
his
wealth
and
magnificence
he
failed
it
seemed
to
pass
her
by
unnoticed
for
pansy
was
much
more
interested
in
his
arab
servants
the
grove
the
distant
view
of
the
sea
than
any
of
the
regal
extravagance
immediately
before
her
when
the
meal
was
over
she
sat
wistful
and
listening
to
the
sigh
of
the
sea
for
some
moments
le
breton
watched
her
just
then
her
mood
appeared
very
out
of
keeping
with
her
boyish
attire
i
like
to
see
you
dressed
in
something
really
feminine
he
remarked
presently
what
your
idea
of
something
feminine
she
inquired
just
one
garment
a
robe
that
would
come
from
your
shoulders
to
your
knees
loose
and
clinging
soft
and
white
with
a
strap
of
pearls
to
hold
it
on
it
sounds
draughty
she
commented
and
it
might
show
my
horrid
scars
it
would
suit
you
admirably
and
i
suppose
it
would
suit
you
admirably
too
to
be
lying
about
on
cushions
with
me
so
attired
waiting
on
you
she
said
quickly
bringing
you
sherbet
and
or
whatever
you
call
those
big
pipe
things
that
men
smoke
in
eastern
pictures
and
on
lids
and
i
should
dare
call
my
soul
my
own
i
should
tremble
at
your
look
that
one
garment
would
place
me
at
a
terrible
disadvantage
i
might
not
be
a
severe
i
might
only
ask
you
to
do
one
thing
and
what
would
that
be
in
english
i
could
say
it
in
two
words
spell
it
in
six
letters
pansy
darted
a
quick
look
at
him
and
a
little
mocking
smile
came
and
hovered
on
her
mouth
she
was
too
accustomed
to
men
and
their
ways
not
to
guess
what
the
two
words
that
could
be
spelt
in
six
letters
were
she
sat
quiet
for
a
moment
or
two
an
impish
look
on
her
face
then
she
rattled
off
a
riddle
in
english
my
first
is
in
apple
but
not
in
pie
my
second
is
in
do
but
not
in
die
my
third
is
in
veal
but
not
in
ham
my
fourth
is
in
sheep
but
not
in
lamb
my
fifth
is
in
morning
but
not
in
night
my
sixth
is
in
darkness
but
not
in
light
my
whole
is
just
a
word
or
two
which
is
known
to
me
as
well
as
to
you
le
breton
knew
more
english
than
he
pretended
but
riddles
did
not
often
come
his
way
say
it
again
slowly
he
requested
pansy
repeated
her
composition
he
stored
it
up
in
his
mind
deciding
to
go
into
the
matter
later
on
when
there
was
no
lovely
little
face
dimpled
with
mischief
looking
at
him
teasingly
from
beneath
a
halo
of
golden
curls
soon
after
this
pansy
glanced
at
her
wrist
watch
i
must
stay
any
longer
she
said
getting
to
her
feet
it
not
nine
yet
he
remarked
i
did
hurry
away
from
you
so
quickly
yesterday
this
pansy
knew
quite
well
he
had
sat
on
and
on
with
her
in
the
with
the
red
roses
and
she
had
been
pleased
to
let
him
stay
in
fact
it
had
been
afternoon
before
they
had
come
down
to
earth
again
captain
cameron
is
coming
this
morning
she
said
and
i
promised
to
be
on
the
quay
to
meet
him
so
saying
she
turned
towards
the
spot
where
the
horses
were
waiting
leaving
him
to
follow
or
not
as
he
liked
pansy
wanted
to
linger
in
the
grove
with
raoul
le
breton
as
she
had
been
pleased
to
stay
with
him
among
the
red
roses
on
the
previous
day
but
she
decided
the
mood
was
not
one
to
be
encouraged
especially
considering
his
desire
for
the
two
words
containing
in
all
six
letters
and
her
own
desire
for
untrammelled
liberty
chapter
x
under
the
trees
that
shadowed
one
corner
of
the
of
the
hotel
a
couple
stood
one
was
a
young
man
of
about
in
white
flannel
trousers
and
who
held
a
tennis
racket
in
one
hand
and
a
couple
of
balls
in
the
other
he
was
of
medium
height
fresh
and
fair
and
boyish
looking
at
his
side
pansy
stood
in
short
skirt
and
blouse
and
panama
hat
well
old
pal
is
there
anything
doing
yet
he
was
asking
cheerfully
there
nothing
doing
bob
much
as
i
try
anyhow
it
a
standing
order
he
said
i
know
and
i
doing
my
best
she
said
i
try
to
go
to
bed
every
night
with
your
name
on
my
lips
but
more
frequently
i
go
with
a
yawn
all
for
the
sake
of
the
dead
days
beyond
recall
which
ones
especially
cameron
inquired
when
i
was
five
and
you
were
nine
and
we
were
all
the
world
to
one
another
in
the
days
of
my
and
distant
youth
i
learnt
a
rotten
poem
from
dire
necessity
not
choice
you
bet
about
some
bore
of
a
scotch
king
and
a
spider
and
the
chorus
or
the
moral
i
forgotten
which
ran
at
first
you
do
succeed
try
again
perseverance
pansy
a
wonderful
thing
you
find
yourself
there
in
the
end
pansy
smiled
a
trifle
wistfully
at
the
boy
she
had
known
all
her
life
who
always
gave
her
nonsense
for
nonsense
and
incidentally
his
heart
bob
i
wish
i
could
love
you
she
said
suddenly
grave
smiling
at
her
he
started
juggling
with
the
two
balls
so
the
spirit
is
willing
he
responded
well
i
shall
go
on
hoping
for
a
triumph
of
mind
over
matter
for
some
reason
pansy
felt
intensely
sorry
for
her
old
playmate
she
caught
herself
making
comparisons
and
something
within
her
suddenly
whispered
that
they
would
never
be
more
than
friends
something
she
did
not
quite
realise
some
change
that
had
taken
place
within
herself
since
they
had
parted
in
teneriffe
only
a
week
before
chapter
xi
raoul
le
breton
took
pansy
riddle
home
to
solve
he
went
about
it
in
his
own
private
sanctum
seating
himself
at
the
desk
he
wrote
out
the
verse
with
a
dictionary
making
sure
his
spelling
was
correct
then
he
set
out
to
find
the
solution
he
was
not
long
in
doing
so
afterwards
he
sat
on
gazing
at
the
pansies
in
the
crystal
bowl
on
the
desk
a
tender
look
on
his
arrogant
face
a
daring
little
creature
that
beautiful
english
girl
frank
as
the
boy
she
looked
in
her
riding
suit
with
attractions
beyond
those
of
her
sex
and
beauty
a
courage
that
roused
his
admiration
a
kindness
that
moved
his
heart
a
disinterestedness
sweet
as
it
was
novel
an
ability
to
touch
parts
of
his
being
no
woman
had
touched
before
and
with
a
subtle
something
about
her
that
brought
him
an
ease
of
spirit
he
rarely
experienced
heart
ease
truly
as
he
brooded
on
pansy
he
forgot
his
vengeance
that
he
was
only
waiting
in
grand
canary
until
quite
certain
sir
george
barclay
was
on
his
way
to
gambia
he
thought
only
of
the
girl
who
had
answered
him
so
deftly
and
laughingly
the
riddle
had
told
him
the
one
thing
he
would
ask
her
to
do
his
two
words
spelt
with
six
letters
love
me
the
fact
sent
le
breton
to
the
hotel
that
evening
for
an
interview
with
the
the
place
was
a
blaze
of
light
and
a
crash
of
music
in
the
big
patio
the
usual
dance
was
taking
place
and
a
crowd
of
people
disported
themselves
to
the
strains
of
a
ragtime
band
le
breton
made
a
striking
figure
in
evening
clothes
and
more
than
one
woman
glanced
at
him
with
invitation
he
took
no
notice
of
them
all
he
wanted
was
a
slim
girl
with
a
mop
of
short
dancing
golden
curls
the
room
was
so
crowded
that
he
could
get
no
glimpse
of
his
quarry
although
he
altered
his
point
of
view
several
times
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
he
decided
to
take
a
turn
round
the
grounds
the
garden
was
soft
with
moonlight
filled
with
a
misty
brightness
and
the
palms
hung
limp
and
sighing
from
beyond
the
wall
came
the
murmur
of
the
sea
syringa
and
roses
filled
the
night
with
perfume
at
one
spot
a
fountain
sang
sweetly
to
itself
there
le
breton
lingered
with
the
moonlight
and
the
ebony
shadows
the
tropical
trees
sighing
languorously
around
him
as
he
waited
there
deep
in
some
reverie
of
his
own
the
sound
of
footsteps
reached
him
then
from
an
adjacent
path
voices
talking
in
english
a
man
thick
low
and
protesting
then
a
girl
clear
and
indignant
when
did
i
encourage
you
she
asked
her
voice
raised
in
righteous
anger
once
you
brought
me
a
cup
of
tea
i
did
want
twice
you
mixed
my
books
and
papers
with
somebody
else
i
was
three
times
your
partner
at
bridge
and
that
was
any
fault
of
mine
i
defy
you
to
mention
more
encouragement
than
that
go
to
your
woman
with
red
hair
and
do
talk
nonsense
to
me
the
man
voice
came
again
then
there
was
a
little
cry
of
anger
and
the
sound
of
a
struggle
the
girl
voice
brought
le
breton
out
of
his
reverie
he
knew
it
although
he
could
not
follow
a
quarter
of
what
was
said
but
the
little
cry
and
the
subsequent
scuffle
sent
him
quickly
in
that
direction
he
saw
pansy
struggling
vainly
to
get
away
from
a
short
man
with
a
red
face
and
fishy
eyes
who
held
her
by
one
bare
arm
le
breton
was
not
long
in
covering
the
distance
that
lay
between
himself
and
the
couple
his
coming
made
pansy
persecutor
let
go
quickly
and
make
off
the
girl
had
been
struggling
with
all
her
might
to
escape
from
his
coarse
hot
grip
and
she
was
too
intent
on
getting
out
of
an
undesirable
situation
even
to
notice
that
someone
approach
was
responsible
for
her
sudden
freedom
the
force
of
her
struggles
sent
her
staggering
backwards
right
on
le
breton
his
arm
went
round
her
he
held
her
pressed
against
him
his
hand
on
her
heart
it
seemed
to
pansy
she
had
gotten
out
of
the
into
the
fire
quivering
with
indignation
she
looked
up
then
she
laughed
in
a
tremulous
manner
oh
it
you
is
it
i
wondered
who
else
was
on
my
trail
you
ought
not
to
be
out
at
night
alone
he
said
severely
a
beautiful
girl
is
a
temptation
to
any
man
i
no
temptation
it
my
money
he
likes
women
with
red
hair
le
breton
scanned
pansy
more
closely
he
had
noticed
she
was
dressed
in
white
but
with
her
unexpectedly
in
his
arms
he
had
not
troubled
to
look
further
she
was
wearing
a
dress
of
chiffon
light
as
air
vague
as
moonlight
that
clung
about
her
like
a
mist
caught
up
here
and
there
with
tiny
diamond
buckles
which
made
the
garment
look
as
if
studded
with
dewdrops
and
on
a
thin
platinum
chain
about
her
neck
was
hung
one
great
sparkling
drop
of
light
le
breton
knew
real
gems
when
he
saw
them
and
that
one
diamond
alone
was
worth
a
fortune
he
bent
his
proud
head
until
his
lips
just
touched
the
fluff
of
golden
curls
who
are
you
really
pansy
he
asked
softly
you
despise
and
dislike
me
already
so
why
should
i
get
further
into
your
black
books
i
despise
and
dislike
you
you
said
you
disliked
all
the
english
i
quite
willing
to
make
an
exception
in
your
favour
when
you
learn
the
truth
you
me
never
he
said
emphatically
well
then
i
woman
of
the
name
of
langham
you
he
exclaimed
then
he
laughed
pansy
you
a
little
creature
of
rare
surprises
the
surprise
held
him
silent
for
some
moments
or
else
it
was
sufficient
to
have
the
girl
there
unresisting
against
his
heart
up
till
now
pansy
had
avoided
all
male
arms
as
far
as
it
was
possible
for
a
girl
who
was
beautiful
wealthy
and
whenever
caught
she
had
wriggled
out
indignantly
from
the
arm
that
held
her
now
she
made
no
attempt
to
escape
a
fearsome
fascination
lay
within
its
embrace
it
seemed
that
he
would
have
but
to
close
the
hand
that
rested
on
her
bosom
and
her
heart
would
be
in
his
grip
snatched
out
of
her
keeping
before
she
knew
it
suddenly
it
dawned
on
pansy
that
if
she
stayed
there
much
longer
she
would
want
to
stay
for
ever
one
by
one
she
lifted
the
sinewy
brown
fingers
from
her
dress
holding
them
in
one
hand
as
she
went
about
her
task
with
the
other
with
a
slight
smile
le
breton
watched
her
but
when
the
last
of
his
fingers
was
removed
she
was
still
a
prisoner
held
secure
within
his
arm
then
pansy
descended
to
strategy
mr
le
breton
will
you
lend
me
your
handkerchief
she
asked
in
a
mild
tone
why
do
you
want
it
the
voice
of
the
master
demanded
to
dip
it
in
the
fountain
there
and
wash
my
arm
it
feels
all
horrid
and
nasty
and
clammy
where
that
odious
man
touched
it
she
said
meekly
the
sentiment
was
one
le
breton
approved
of
and
sympathised
with
letting
her
go
he
drew
out
his
handkerchief
taking
it
pansy
turned
towards
the
fountain
he
followed
and
stood
beside
her
obviously
waiting
until
her
task
was
finished
before
carrying
the
situation
further
as
pansy
scrubbed
away
at
her
arm
she
kept
a
rather
nervous
eye
on
him
when
the
task
was
completed
she
screwed
the
handkerchief
up
into
a
loose
wet
ball
but
she
did
not
throw
it
on
the
ground
as
le
breton
expected
and
was
waiting
for
her
to
do
before
taking
her
into
his
arms
again
instead
she
threw
it
into
his
face
it
took
him
by
surprise
an
indignity
that
had
not
come
his
way
hitherto
people
were
not
in
the
habit
of
throwing
wet
handkerchiefs
with
stinging
force
into
the
face
of
the
sultan
casim
ammeh
the
force
and
wetness
temporarily
blinded
him
he
was
perhaps
ten
seconds
in
recovering
his
sight
and
his
dignity
then
he
looked
for
the
girl
she
was
running
as
fast
as
she
could
away
from
him
down
a
misty
moonlit
path
in
her
chiffon
and
diamonds
looking
a
shimmer
of
moonlight
and
sparkling
dew
herself
pansy
only
desire
just
then
was
to
get
out
of
the
white
romantic
moonlit
world
with
its
scents
and
sighs
and
seductive
murmurs
back
to
one
of
electric
light
and
ragtime
where
there
was
no
raoul
le
breton
looking
at
her
gravely
with
glowing
eyes
he
had
suddenly
become
a
startling
menace
to
her
cherished
liberty
this
big
dark
man
with
his
masterful
air
and
ways
whatever
he
said
she
would
have
to
listen
to
perhaps
even
agree
with
chapter
xii
le
breton
did
not
run
after
the
girl
he
watched
her
go
with
a
feeling
that
he
could
afford
to
bide
his
time
but
at
six
the
next
morning
he
was
round
at
the
hotel
waiting
for
pansy
to
come
for
her
usual
ride
however
there
was
no
sign
of
her
either
that
morning
or
the
following
in
fact
it
was
not
until
the
afternoon
of
the
second
day
that
he
saw
anything
of
her
a
tennis
tournament
was
taking
place
at
the
hotel
le
breton
went
feeling
sure
pansy
would
be
there
and
incidentally
to
find
out
what
captain
cameron
the
local
tennis
champion
was
like
he
saw
a
youngster
decidedly
than
the
rest
of
the
men
there
but
too
much
like
the
girl
herself
ever
to
be
able
to
hold
her
then
he
looked
for
pansy
she
was
seated
with
a
group
of
acquaintances
awaiting
her
turn
on
the
courts
on
seeing
le
breton
she
vouchsafed
him
a
smile
and
a
nod
but
no
further
attention
after
a
three
days
tournament
cameron
emerged
victor
but
le
breton
had
managed
to
get
no
word
with
pansy
whenever
he
came
within
speaking
distance
she
edged
away
taking
cover
behind
someone
to
catch
her
was
like
setting
a
trap
to
catch
a
moonbeam
at
the
end
of
the
tournament
word
went
round
that
a
rank
outsider
had
challenged
the
victor
who
is
it
bob
pansy
asked
when
the
news
reached
her
cameron
pointed
with
his
racket
across
the
court
to
where
le
breton
stood
in
panama
hat
and
grey
flannels
that
big
chap
over
there
he
said
he
got
a
nerve
has
he
and
did
you
accept
pansy
asked
of
course
i
did
i
could
let
that
sort
of
cheek
pass
other
people
had
heard
what
was
happening
an
interested
crowd
collected
around
the
court
for
word
had
gone
round
that
the
man
who
had
challenged
the
english
champion
was
raoul
le
breton
the
french
millionaire
captain
cameron
had
not
been
long
on
the
court
before
he
discovered
he
had
met
his
equal
if
not
his
superior
with
a
long
lithe
movement
le
breton
was
all
over
the
ground
seemingly
unhurried
but
always
there
at
the
right
moment
making
his
opponent
play
look
like
a
heated
scramble
but
le
breton
serving
was
his
great
point
a
lightning
stroke
that
gave
no
hint
as
to
where
the
ball
would
land
sometimes
it
was
just
over
the
net
sometimes
just
within
the
furthermost
limits
of
the
court
cameron
was
beaten
a
beating
he
took
with
a
boyish
smile
as
he
congratulated
the
winner
others
crowded
round
le
breton
anxious
to
add
their
quota
to
the
praise
when
the
crowd
dispersed
pansy
approached
him
as
he
stood
cool
and
dignified
despite
the
strenuous
game
you
never
told
me
you
could
play
tennis
she
remarked
there
are
lots
of
things
about
myself
i
have
told
you
he
replied
drily
what
are
they
she
asked
you
must
rouse
my
curiosity
and
then
not
satisfy
it
you
need
worry
i
shall
tell
you
some
day
he
answered
as
pansy
talked
to
him
she
played
battledore
and
shuttlecock
with
her
racket
and
ball
when
will
that
day
be
she
asked
the
sooner
the
better
it
bad
for
my
health
to
be
kept
in
a
state
of
inquisitive
suspense
the
sooner
the
better
will
suit
me
admirably
he
said
for
i
shall
tell
you
when
we
are
married
pansy
just
stared
at
him
then
i
shall
never
hear
she
said
when
she
had
recovered
her
breath
for
i
shall
never
get
married
never
at
least
not
before
forty
there
was
a
brief
pause
why
are
you
avoiding
me
he
asked
presently
what
a
stupid
thing
to
say
are
i
here
talking
to
you
now
with
a
whole
crowd
of
people
round
yes
she
tapped
the
tennis
ball
from
her
racket
to
his
chest
hitting
it
back
and
back
again
as
if
he
were
a
wall
for
some
minutes
le
breton
watched
her
in
an
amused
manner
as
if
she
were
something
so
favoured
that
she
could
do
what
she
liked
with
him
then
he
caught
the
ball
and
stopped
the
game
i
a
challenge
for
you
too
pansy
he
said
will
you
meet
me
after
dinner
near
the
fountain
it
would
require
a
great
amount
of
courage
to
do
that
will
you
come
then
you
said
i
was
to
wander
about
in
the
grounds
alone
at
night
i
come
for
you
then
since
you
so
anxious
to
comply
with
my
desires
with
my
desires
she
repeated
mockingly
that
a
nice
useful
phrase
to
hurl
about
there
was
an
air
of
unusual
and
unaccustomed
patience
about
le
breton
as
he
argued
with
his
moonbeam
curious
glances
were
cast
in
the
direction
of
the
couple
miss
langham
had
never
been
seen
to
favour
a
man
as
she
was
favouring
the
french
millionaire
birds
of
a
feather
someone
remarked
with
some
surprise
young
cameron
watched
her
another
watched
her
too
the
man
from
whose
undesired
attentions
le
breton
had
rescued
her
a
few
nights
before
if
you
do
come
i
shall
know
what
to
think
le
breton
said
that
you
dare
not
a
suspicion
of
a
blush
deepened
the
pink
in
the
girl
cheeks
and
if
i
do
come
what
shall
you
think
then
she
asked
him
with
a
nonchalant
air
it
be
quite
time
enough
to
tell
you
when
that
comes
to
pass
he
answered
pansy
had
no
intention
that
it
should
come
to
pass
raoul
le
breton
might
keep
the
tryst
if
he
liked
but
she
would
not
be
there
not
if
she
could
help
it
a
little
voice
within
her
added
chapter
xiii
when
night
came
pansy
tried
not
to
think
of
le
breton
but
the
idea
of
him
out
there
in
the
moonlight
haunted
her
she
wondered
how
long
he
would
wait
patience
did
not
look
to
be
one
of
his
virtues
there
was
a
dance
at
the
hotel
again
that
evening
as
she
whirled
round
and
round
slim
and
light
looking
in
her
chiffon
and
diamonds
a
creature
of
mist
and
dew
her
thoughts
were
with
none
of
her
partners
they
were
out
in
the
garden
with
the
big
masterful
man
who
was
so
different
from
all
others
of
his
sex
who
had
come
into
her
life
by
midnight
the
gaieties
were
over
pansy
went
up
to
her
room
but
she
did
not
go
to
bed
dismissing
her
maid
she
went
out
on
the
balcony
and
stood
there
watching
the
sea
as
she
had
watched
it
barely
a
week
before
when
le
breton
had
come
into
her
life
the
world
was
as
white
and
peaceful
as
then
the
sea
a
stretch
of
murmurous
silver
the
garden
vaguely
sighing
the
little
moist
cool
puffs
of
wind
ladened
with
the
scent
of
roses
and
the
fragrance
of
foreign
flowers
as
she
watched
the
scene
an
overpowering
desire
to
go
and
see
if
le
breton
were
still
there
seized
her
a
desire
that
rapidly
became
an
obsession
of
course
he
would
not
stay
from
nine
until
after
midnight
for
all
that
pansy
felt
she
must
go
that
she
must
linger
for
a
moment
in
the
spot
where
he
had
lingered
she
turned
quickly
into
her
room
then
out
into
the
corridor
down
the
stairs
and
on
towards
a
door
that
led
out
into
the
grounds
once
there
the
moonlight
drew
her
on
towards
the
fountain
on
reaching
the
there
was
no
sign
of
anybody
there
with
a
feeling
of
intense
disappointment
pansy
turned
towards
the
and
stood
there
with
the
soft
light
shimmering
on
her
her
face
wistful
as
she
watched
the
molten
sea
now
that
she
had
come
to
find
le
breton
gone
hurt
her
if
he
really
liked
her
he
would
have
stayed
all
night
on
the
chance
of
her
coming
she
would
if
she
were
really
fond
of
anybody
a
tear
came
and
sparkled
on
her
long
dark
lashes
he
could
not
love
her
very
much
or
he
would
not
have
left
a
slight
movement
in
the
shadows
behind
made
her
face
round
quickly
her
heart
giving
a
sudden
bound
well
pansy
the
voice
she
knew
so
well
said
in
a
caressing
tone
she
laughed
tremulously
i
thought
you
gone
hours
ago
she
said
le
breton
came
to
her
side
a
mocking
look
in
his
dark
smouldering
eyes
as
he
watched
her
there
are
two
things
a
man
will
always
wait
for
if
they
cut
deeply
enough
he
replied
love
and
revenge
how
dramatic
you
sound
which
has
kept
you
on
the
prowl
she
asked
lightly
edging
away
from
him
but
his
arm
went
round
her
quickly
and
she
was
drawn
back
to
his
side
no
my
little
girl
not
this
time
he
whispered
she
tried
to
free
herself
from
his
embrace
i
did
mean
to
come
i
really
did
she
said
breathlessly
he
laughed
in
a
tender
masterful
fashion
possibly
not
but
since
you
here
i
intend
that
you
shall
stay
no
no
she
said
quickly
let
me
go
pansy
struggled
after
a
liberty
that
she
saw
rapidly
vanishing
but
he
just
held
her
firmly
strongly
watching
her
with
an
amused
air
i
shall
spoil
my
dress
if
i
have
to
wrestle
with
you
like
this
she
panted
presently
do
wrestle
then
he
said
coolly
stay
where
you
are
little
moonbeam
and
no
harm
will
come
to
the
dress
it
was
fatal
to
be
in
his
arms
again
she
stopped
struggling
and
stayed
passive
within
his
embrace
with
easy
strength
le
breton
lifted
her
going
to
a
bench
he
sat
down
with
her
on
his
knee
why
did
you
run
away
from
me
the
other
night
he
asked
a
slim
finger
played
rather
nervously
with
a
black
pearl
stud
in
the
front
of
his
dress
shirt
i
do
know
she
said
her
eyes
avoiding
his
then
she
laughed
oh
yes
i
do
she
went
on
because
i
could
do
as
i
liked
if
i
stayed
with
you
i
could
never
be
a
hard
taskmaster
not
with
you
he
said
softly
are
you
with
some
people
she
asked
le
breton
thought
of
the
desert
kingdom
he
ruled
alone
and
he
laughed
then
he
kissed
the
little
mouth
so
temptingly
close
to
his
own
a
long
passionate
caress
that
seemed
to
take
all
strength
from
the
girl
her
head
fell
on
his
shoulder
and
she
lay
limp
within
his
arms
watching
him
in
a
vague
dreamy
manner
for
a
time
there
was
silence
le
breton
sat
with
her
pressed
against
his
heart
as
if
to
have
her
there
were
i
feel
like
jonah
pansy
said
presently
all
swallowed
up
there
seems
to
be
nothing
in
the
whole
wide
world
now
but
you
with
a
loving
hand
he
caressed
her
silky
curls
and
i
heart
ease
want
nothing
but
you
henceforth
and
forever
pansy
snuggled
closer
to
him
to
think
i
sitting
here
on
your
knee
she
whispered
a
week
ago
i
did
know
there
was
any
you
and
now
i
only
know
your
name
and
she
broke
off
a
blush
deepening
the
roses
on
her
cheeks
and
what
my
darling
he
asked
tenderly
put
your
ear
quite
close
it
not
a
matter
that
can
be
shouted
from
the
he
bent
his
proud
head
down
close
to
the
girl
lips
and
that
i
love
you
she
whispered
then
she
kissed
the
ear
the
confession
had
been
made
into
and
that
you
will
marry
me
he
added
perhaps
some
day
twenty
years
hence
she
said
airily
when
had
my
fling
le
breton
had
never
had
to
wait
for
any
woman
he
fancied
and
he
had
no
intention
of
waiting
now
no
pansy
you
must
marry
me
now
at
once
he
said
firmly
what
a
hustler
you
are
raoul
you
must
have
american
blood
in
you
she
said
his
name
as
if
she
loved
it
on
her
lips
it
was
a
caress
with
a
touch
of
savagery
his
arms
tightened
round
the
girl
even
with
her
in
his
embrace
he
guessed
that
if
she
knew
of
the
sultan
casim
ammeh
there
would
be
no
chance
for
him
his
dark
blood
would
be
an
efficient
barrier
one
she
would
never
cross
willingly
say
you
will
marry
me
next
week
my
little
english
flower
he
said
in
a
fierce
insistent
tone
i
could
dream
of
getting
married
for
ages
and
ages
he
held
her
closer
kissing
the
vivid
lips
that
refused
him
say
next
week
my
darling
he
whispered
passionately
i
shall
keep
you
here
until
you
say
next
week
pansy
looked
at
him
with
love
and
teasing
in
her
eyes
it
midnight
now
or
perhaps
it
one
or
even
two
in
the
morning
time
flies
so
when
i
with
you
but
at
six
the
gardeners
will
be
here
with
rakes
and
brooms
and
they
scratch
and
sweep
us
out
of
our
corner
six
hours
at
most
you
can
keep
me
but
the
gardeners
wo
let
you
keep
me
longer
than
that
raoul
i
go
to
sleep
in
the
meantime
in
a
pretence
of
slumber
pansy
closed
her
eyes
with
a
tender
smile
he
watched
the
little
face
that
looked
so
peacefully
asleep
on
his
shoulder
wake
up
my
flower
and
say
things
are
to
be
as
i
wish
he
said
presently
one
eye
opened
and
looked
at
him
full
of
love
and
mischief
in
ten
years
time
then
raoul
that
a
great
concession
in
a
fortnight
that
would
seem
eternity
enough
he
replied
well
five
years
then
pansy
answered
suddenly
wide
awake
i
could
see
and
do
a
lot
in
five
years
if
i
worked
hard
at
it
especially
with
the
thought
of
you
looming
ominously
in
the
background
in
three
weeks
little
girl
i
been
waiting
for
you
all
my
life
pansy
stroked
his
face
with
a
mocking
caressing
hand
poor
boy
you
do
look
like
a
waiter
he
took
the
small
teasing
hand
into
his
own
never
mind
what
i
look
like
just
now
he
said
say
in
three
time
my
darling
two
years
give
me
two
years
to
get
used
to
the
cramped
idea
of
matrimony
a
month
not
a
day
longer
heart
ease
unless
you
want
to
drive
me
quite
mad
he
said
a
note
of
desperate
entreaty
in
his
voice
suddenly
pansy
could
not
meet
the
eyes
that
watched
her
with
such
love
and
passion
in
their
smouldering
depths
this
big
dark
man
who
had
come
into
her
life
so
strangely
seemed
to
leave
her
nothing
but
a
desire
for
himself
at
that
moment
she
could
refuse
him
nothing
in
a
month
then
raoul
but
it
very
of
me
giving
in
to
you
this
way
he
laughed
in
a
tender
and
triumphant
manner
my
darling
i
promise
you
never
regret
it
he
said
a
slight
catch
in
his
strong
voice
then
he
sat
on
with
pansy
pressed
close
against
him
and
the
latent
searching
look
had
gone
from
his
eyes
as
if
the
girl
lying
on
his
heart
had
brought
him
ease
and
peace
and
pansy
was
content
to
stay
just
then
it
was
sufficient
to
be
with
him
to
feel
the
tender
strength
of
his
arms
to
listen
to
the
music
of
his
deep
caressing
voice
to
have
his
long
passionate
kisses
nothing
else
mattered
even
liberty
was
forgotten
chapter
xiv
the
next
morning
the
sun
streaming
into
pansy
bedroom
roused
her
she
awoke
with
the
feeling
of
having
indulged
in
some
delightful
dream
which
like
all
dreams
must
melt
with
the
morning
she
thought
of
the
episode
with
le
breton
in
the
garden
a
gentle
look
lingered
on
her
face
he
was
a
darling
the
nicest
man
she
had
ever
met
the
only
one
she
had
ever
liked
enough
to
let
kiss
her
the
only
one
in
whose
arms
she
had
been
content
to
stay
but
about
marrying
a
frown
came
and
rested
on
her
white
brow
marrying
was
quite
another
matter
in
a
month
time
a
thing
not
to
be
contemplated
pansy
sat
up
suddenly
hugging
her
knees
as
she
gazed
thoughtfully
at
the
brilliant
expanse
of
dancing
shimmering
sea
that
sparkled
at
her
through
the
open
bedroom
window
she
engaged
to
be
married
she
who
had
vowed
never
to
fall
in
love
until
forty
it
was
love
pansy
had
wanted
in
the
moonlit
garden
with
le
arms
about
her
but
it
was
liberty
she
wanted
now
as
she
sat
hugging
her
knees
amazed
at
herself
and
her
own
behaviour
she
had
bartered
her
liberty
for
a
man
arms
and
a
few
kisses
pansy
could
hardly
believe
herself
capable
of
such
folly
she
had
been
swept
off
her
feet
over
her
depth
before
she
knew
it
by
daylight
her
freedom
and
independence
were
as
sweet
to
her
as
le
breton
love
had
been
by
the
romantic
light
of
the
moon
in
the
sober
light
of
morning
she
tried
to
struggle
back
to
where
she
had
been
before
the
hot
flood
of
love
he
had
poured
over
her
had
made
her
promise
more
than
she
was
now
prepared
to
fulfill
it
a
woman
privilege
to
change
her
mind
pansy
grasped
at
the
old
adage
but
to
her
a
promise
was
a
promise
not
lightly
given
or
lightly
snatched
away
so
she
did
not
derive
much
comfort
from
dwelling
on
the
old
saw
she
was
sitting
up
in
bed
hugging
her
knees
and
frowning
in
dire
perplexity
when
her
maid
came
in
with
the
early
morning
tea
and
the
frown
was
there
when
the
woman
came
to
say
her
bath
was
ready
a
thoughtful
mood
enveloped
her
during
her
dressing
and
out
of
her
musing
this
note
was
born
my
dearest
raoul
i
can
call
you
that
because
you
are
dearer
to
me
than
any
one
on
this
earth
dearest
beyond
all
things
except
my
liberty
do
not
be
horrid
and
cross
when
i
say
i
can
not
marry
you
in
spite
of
all
i
promised
last
night
not
for
ten
years
at
least
and
even
then
i
can
not
bind
myself
in
any
way
for
i
might
be
still
hankering
after
freedom
i
do
love
you
really
more
than
anything
in
the
whole
wide
world
except
my
independence
you
must
not
be
too
hard
on
me
raoul
i
am
not
quite
the
same
as
other
women
it
is
not
every
girl
of
twenty
who
is
her
own
mistress
with
a
year
to
do
what
she
likes
with
it
has
made
life
seem
so
vast
matrimony
such
a
cramped
everyday
affair
and
i
do
not
want
to
handicap
myself
in
any
way
this
letter
sounds
awfully
selfish
i
know
i
am
not
selfish
really
only
i
love
my
liberty
it
is
the
one
thing
that
is
dearer
to
me
than
you
always
your
loving
pansy
when
the
letter
was
written
pansy
suddenly
remembered
she
did
not
know
his
address
once
satisfied
that
he
was
disinterested
she
had
bothered
about
nothing
else
and
after
that
one
day
spent
among
the
red
roses
he
had
become
something
quite
apart
from
the
rest
of
the
world
not
to
be
gossiped
about
to
mere
people
however
she
knew
that
twenty
pesetas
given
to
the
would
ensure
the
note
reaching
its
destination
the
hotel
staff
would
know
where
he
was
staying
even
if
she
did
not
because
the
note
was
to
le
breton
pansy
took
it
down
herself
and
gave
it
to
the
when
this
was
done
she
wandered
as
far
as
the
spot
where
she
had
made
her
fleeting
vows
to
see
how
it
looked
by
daylight
she
lingered
there
for
some
minutes
and
then
returned
to
her
suite
in
the
interval
a
message
had
come
from
le
breton
it
stood
on
one
of
the
little
tables
of
her
a
huge
gilded
wicker
basket
full
of
red
roses
in
the
midst
of
the
flowers
a
packet
reposed
tied
with
red
ribbon
pansy
opened
the
package
inside
was
the
gold
casket
she
had
once
refused
it
was
filled
with
purple
pansies
still
wet
with
dew
on
them
a
ring
reposed
with
one
huge
sapphire
deeply
blue
as
her
own
eyes
there
was
a
note
in
with
the
flowers
written
in
a
strong
masculine
hand
with
a
flutter
about
her
heart
pansy
picked
it
out
and
read
it
heart
ease
my
own
dear
little
girl
this
little
gift
comes
to
you
with
all
my
love
my
heart
my
soul
my
very
life
indeed
given
forever
into
your
keeping
a
week
ago
if
anyone
had
told
me
i
should
write
such
words
to
a
woman
i
should
have
laughed
at
them
until
meeting
you
i
did
not
know
what
love
was
i
had
no
idea
one
woman
could
be
so
satisfying
in
you
i
have
found
the
heaven
i
have
been
searching
for
all
my
life
my
one
houri
and
she
my
little
english
flower
so
sweet
and
winsome
so
kind
and
wayward
so
teasing
and
yet
so
tender
who
has
brought
a
new
fragrance
into
my
life
a
peace
my
soul
has
never
known
till
now
a
love
and
gratitude
into
my
heart
that
will
keep
me
hers
for
ever
your
devoted
lover
now
and
through
all
eternity
raoul
le
breton
as
pansy
read
the
note
her
lips
trembled
she
wished
she
had
never
tasted
of
the
sweets
of
liberty
and
independence
that
the
had
not
left
her
his
millions
she
wished
she
was
pansy
barclay
again
a
mere
girl
not
one
with
enormous
riches
luring
her
towards
all
sorts
of
goals
where
love
was
not
just
pansy
barclay
who
could
have
met
his
love
with
kisses
and
not
a
cruel
counter
note
chapter
xv
considering
it
was
nearly
two
in
the
morning
before
le
breton
would
let
pansy
out
of
his
arms
he
did
not
expect
her
to
be
out
and
about
at
six
for
her
usual
ride
nevertheless
he
looked
in
at
the
hotel
at
that
hour
and
then
rode
on
indulging
in
blissful
daydreams
he
knew
pansy
had
no
idea
who
he
really
was
he
was
prepared
to
marry
her
according
to
her
creed
for
her
sake
to
put
aside
the
fierce
profligate
religion
the
late
sultan
casim
ammeh
had
instilled
into
him
and
he
was
prepared
to
do
very
much
more
than
this
in
spite
of
his
colossal
pride
in
his
sultanship
and
his
desert
kingdom
he
knew
that
if
pansy
got
an
inkling
of
that
side
of
his
life
his
case
would
be
hopeless
his
one
idea
was
to
keep
all
knowledge
of
the
supposed
arab
strain
in
him
from
her
the
sultanship
could
go
his
kingdom
be
but
a
source
of
income
he
would
buy
a
house
in
paris
they
would
settle
down
there
and
he
would
become
wholly
the
european
she
imagined
him
to
be
full
of
a
future
that
held
nothing
but
the
english
girl
to
whom
he
was
betrothed
and
a
desire
to
keep
from
her
all
knowledge
of
his
dark
savage
heritage
at
least
until
it
would
be
too
late
for
her
to
draw
back
le
breton
rode
on
rejoicing
in
the
early
morning
freshness
that
reminded
him
of
the
girl
he
loved
on
returning
to
the
villa
he
interviewed
the
head
gardener
then
he
went
to
the
library
to
write
a
note
and
tie
up
the
package
he
was
sending
to
pansy
and
from
there
down
to
breakfast
a
solitary
meal
with
no
companion
save
a
few
purple
pansies
smiling
at
him
from
a
crystal
vase
as
he
sat
at
his
light
repast
one
of
his
arab
servants
entered
with
a
note
on
a
salver
le
breton
took
it
on
the
envelope
was
just
his
name
written
in
a
pretty
girlish
hand
although
he
had
never
seen
pansy
writing
before
he
guessed
it
was
hers
a
tender
smile
hovered
about
his
hard
mouth
as
he
opened
it
what
had
she
to
say
to
him
this
slim
winsome
girl
who
held
his
fierce
heart
in
her
small
white
hands
some
fond
reply
no
doubt
in
return
for
his
gifts
and
flowers
thanks
and
words
of
love
that
she
could
not
keep
until
he
went
round
to
see
her
there
were
many
things
le
breton
expected
of
pansy
but
certainly
not
the
news
the
note
contained
he
read
it
through
unable
to
believe
what
he
saw
written
before
him
and
as
he
read
his
face
lost
all
its
tender
caressing
look
and
took
on
instead
a
savage
incredulous
expression
women
had
always
come
to
him
easily
as
easily
as
pansy
herself
had
come
but
they
had
not
withdrawn
themselves
again
he
had
done
the
withdrawing
for
some
moments
he
just
stared
at
the
note
he
flouted
and
scorned
and
played
with
by
a
girl
he
to
whom
all
women
were
but
toys
he
the
sultan
of
le
breton
was
like
one
plunged
suddenly
into
an
icy
cold
bath
the
unexpectedness
of
it
all
left
him
numb
then
a
surge
of
hot
rage
went
through
him
finally
leaving
him
cold
collected
and
furious
she
had
dared
to
scorn
him
this
english
girl
dared
to
hurl
his
love
and
protestations
back
into
his
teeth
protestations
such
as
he
had
made
to
no
other
woman
it
was
the
greatest
shock
and
surprise
le
breton
had
had
during
the
course
of
his
wild
life
of
unquestioned
power
and
limitless
money
he
was
in
no
mood
to
see
the
love
her
note
breathed
he
saw
only
one
fact
that
he
had
been
cast
aside
a
woman
had
dared
to
act
towards
him
as
he
had
often
acted
towards
women
as
he
brooded
on
the
note
trying
to
grasp
the
almost
incredible
truth
the
cruel
look
about
his
mouth
deepened
putting
the
note
into
his
pocket
he
poured
himself
another
cup
of
coffee
then
he
sat
on
staring
at
the
purple
pansies
no
longer
lost
in
dreams
of
love
and
delight
where
his
one
aim
was
to
be
all
the
girl
imagined
him
to
be
but
in
a
savage
reverie
that
had
love
in
it
perhaps
but
of
quite
another
quality
than
that
which
he
had
already
offered
full
of
anger
and
injured
pride
as
le
breton
was
it
did
not
prevent
him
going
over
to
the
hotel
and
inquiring
for
miss
langham
he
learnt
that
she
was
out
on
board
her
yacht
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
had
fled
from
his
wrath
but
he
was
wrong
pansy
had
gone
there
knowing
he
would
be
sure
to
come
and
inquire
into
the
meaning
of
her
note
on
board
her
yacht
there
was
more
privacy
a
privacy
she
wanted
for
le
breton
sake
not
her
own
considering
his
fiery
latin
temperament
he
might
not
take
his
in
the
manner
of
her
more
stolid
nation
there
might
be
a
scene
she
never
imagined
he
would
take
her
decree
calmly
there
was
an
air
about
him
as
if
he
had
never
been
thwarted
in
any
way
she
was
prepared
for
some
unpleasant
minutes
minutes
nevertheless
that
she
had
no
intention
of
shirking
which
she
knew
she
had
brought
upon
herself
by
her
impetuous
promises
she
was
sitting
alone
in
her
own
special
sanctum
on
the
yacht
it
was
a
large
saloon
boudoir
and
study
combined
white
and
gold
and
purple
like
herself
with
a
grand
piano
in
one
corner
deep
chairs
upholstered
in
yellow
with
purple
cushions
a
yellow
carpet
and
white
walls
and
ceiling
in
the
midst
of
it
she
sat
cool
and
collected
in
a
simple
white
yachting
suit
as
le
breton
entered
she
rose
scanning
him
quickly
she
had
never
seen
him
so
proud
and
his
face
so
set
and
hard
but
there
was
a
look
of
suppressed
suffering
in
his
eyes
that
cut
her
to
the
quick
neither
said
a
word
until
the
door
closed
behind
the
steward
then
le
breton
crossed
to
the
girl
side
what
nonsense
is
this
he
asked
in
a
cold
angry
voice
holding
her
note
towards
her
you
promised
to
marry
me
and
you
must
carry
out
your
promise
i
not
going
to
be
put
lightly
to
one
side
in
this
manner
i
have
put
you
lightly
to
one
side
she
answered
i
think
i
explained
exactly
how
things
were
in
my
note
explanations
i
not
here
for
explanations
he
said
with
cold
impatience
but
to
insist
that
you
fulfill
your
promise
i
could
do
that
she
replied
quietly
with
the
air
of
still
moving
in
the
midst
of
some
incredible
truth
he
stared
at
her
you
been
flirting
with
me
he
said
presently
a
note
of
savagery
and
scorn
in
his
voice
you
are
a
true
english
you
rouse
a
man
without
the
least
intention
of
satisfying
him
pansy
flushed
under
his
contempt
she
hated
being
called
a
flirt
she
was
not
one
she
did
not
know
why
she
had
acted
as
she
had
done
the
previous
night
but
once
in
his
arms
she
had
wanted
to
stay
and
once
he
had
started
talking
of
love
she
wanted
to
listen
with
him
she
had
forgotten
all
about
her
own
scheme
of
life
and
her
cherished
liberty
she
knew
she
had
not
played
the
game
with
le
breton
from
the
bottom
of
her
heart
she
was
sorry
she
did
not
blame
him
but
herself
i
not
a
flirt
she
said
quietly
i
never
let
any
man
kiss
me
before
i
very
sorry
for
all
that
happened
last
night
he
laughed
in
a
harsh
grating
manner
good
god
pansy
there
are
a
hundred
women
and
more
plotting
and
scheming
to
try
and
make
me
feel
for
them
what
i
feel
for
you
and
you
say
you
sorry
he
broke
off
his
proud
face
twisted
with
pain
and
chagrin
pansy
knew
his
was
no
idle
boast
an
army
of
women
must
lie
in
wait
for
a
man
of
his
wealth
combined
with
good
looks
and
such
powers
of
fascination
i
only
sorry
you
picked
on
me
she
said
a
note
of
distress
in
her
voice
more
sorry
than
i
can
say
you
know
i
hate
giving
pain
like
one
dazed
the
sultan
casim
ammeh
listened
to
a
woman
saying
she
was
sorry
he
had
favoured
her
as
he
had
no
other
of
her
sex
to
an
extent
he
had
never
imagined
he
would
favour
any
woman
so
that
he
was
ready
to
change
his
religion
his
whole
mode
of
life
for
her
sake
but
i
could
give
up
my
liberty
her
voice
was
saying
i
get
married
and
i
a
perfect
right
to
change
my
mind
it
not
a
privilege
i
intend
to
allow
you
he
said
in
a
strangled
voice
well
it
one
i
intend
to
assert
she
answered
suddenly
goaded
by
his
imperious
attitude
you
deliberately
fooled
me
he
said
savagely
no
i
have
really
she
replied
patient
again
under
the
pain
in
the
fierce
restless
eyes
watching
her
i
like
you
immensely
but
not
enough
to
marry
you
i
suppose
i
ought
to
feel
flattered
he
said
cuttingly
pansy
laid
a
hand
on
his
sleeve
with
a
little
soothing
conciliatory
gesture
do
be
so
horrid
raoul
do
try
and
see
things
as
i
see
them
i
did
mean
to
say
last
night
but
when
you
held
me
in
your
arms
and
kissed
me
there
was
nothing
else
i
could
do
his
name
on
her
lips
her
touch
on
his
arm
broke
through
his
seethe
of
cold
anger
and
if
i
held
and
kissed
you
again
what
then
he
asked
suddenly
melting
here
in
the
light
of
day
it
would
alter
my
intention
in
the
least
she
said
there
are
so
many
things
that
call
me
in
the
daytime
but
last
night
raoul
there
was
only
you
he
bent
over
her
dark
and
handsome
looking
the
king
the
sultan
casim
ammeh
had
made
him
give
me
the
nights
pansy
he
whispered
and
the
days
i
leave
to
you
oh
no
i
could
before
so
long
you
have
swallowed
up
my
days
too
for
there
an
air
about
you
as
if
you
would
be
satisfied
until
you
had
the
whole
of
me
but
i
shall
often
think
of
last
night
she
went
on
a
touch
of
longing
in
her
voice
in
days
to
come
when
we
thousands
of
miles
apart
in
the
midst
of
my
schemes
when
the
lights
are
brightest
and
the
bands
their
loudest
and
the
fun
at
its
highest
i
shall
stop
all
at
once
with
a
little
pain
in
my
heart
and
wonder
where
the
nice
man
is
who
kissed
me
under
the
palms
in
the
grand
canary
and
i
shall
say
to
myself
if
i
been
a
marrying
sort
i
have
married
him
and
twenty
years
hence
when
pleasure
palls
i
shall
wish
i
had
married
him
because
there
never
be
any
man
i
shall
like
half
as
much
as
i
like
you
as
she
talked
le
breton
watched
her
wild
schemes
budding
and
blossoming
in
his
head
and
i
what
shall
i
be
thinking
he
asked
you
oh
you
have
forgotten
all
about
me
by
next
year
perhaps
next
month
even
she
replied
smiling
at
him
rather
sadly
one
girl
is
much
the
same
to
you
as
the
next
provided
she
equally
pretty
and
you
be
thinking
an
idiotic
fuss
i
made
over
that
girl
i
met
in
grand
canary
let
me
see
what
her
name
violet
or
daisy
or
some
stupid
flower
name
who
said
yes
in
the
moonlight
and
no
in
the
cool
calm
light
of
day
good
lord
but
for
her
sense
i
should
be
married
now
married
phew
what
an
escape
for
if
roped
me
in
there
have
been
no
gallivanting
with
other
women
le
breton
laughed
now
i
forgiven
she
said
quickly
forgiven
heart
ease
yes
but
whilst
there
life
in
me
never
be
forgotten
he
paused
looking
at
her
speculatively
so
far
as
i
see
there
nothing
between
us
except
that
you
too
fond
of
your
own
way
to
get
married
he
remarked
presently
yes
i
suppose
that
it
really
i
were
a
king
in
babylon
and
you
were
a
christian
slave
he
quoted
or
to
get
down
to
more
modern
times
if
i
were
a
barbaric
sultan
somewhere
in
africa
and
you
a
girl
i
fancied
and
caught
and
carried
off
i
just
take
you
into
my
harem
and
nothing
more
would
be
said
i
should
fight
like
a
wildcat
you
get
horribly
scratched
and
bitten
possibly
but
i
should
win
in
the
end
pansy
face
went
suddenly
crimson
under
the
glowing
eyes
that
watched
her
with
such
love
and
desire
in
their
dark
depths
i
think
we
talking
a
lot
of
nonsense
she
remarked
what
is
it
you
english
say
many
a
true
word
spoken
in
jest
he
replied
with
curious
emphasis
it
was
not
jest
to
him
even
as
he
stood
talking
to
pansy
he
was
cogitating
on
how
he
could
best
get
her
into
his
power
should
persuasion
fail
to
bring
her
back
to
his
arms
within
a
week
or
two
his
yacht
was
in
the
harbour
she
was
in
the
habit
of
wandering
about
alone
he
had
half
a
dozen
arab
servants
with
him
men
who
would
do
without
question
anything
their
sultan
told
them
to
abduct
her
would
be
an
easy
matter
once
she
was
in
his
power
he
would
take
her
to
and
keep
her
there
as
his
wife
if
she
would
marry
him
as
his
slave
if
she
would
not
le
breton
had
no
desire
to
do
any
such
thing
except
as
a
last
resource
but
he
had
no
intention
of
letting
pansy
go
her
voice
broke
into
his
broodings
since
you
been
so
nice
about
everything
i
going
to
keep
you
and
take
you
for
a
cruise
round
the
island
i
want
to
have
just
one
day
alone
with
you
so
that
in
years
to
come
i
shall
know
exactly
how
much
i
missed
he
smiled
in
a
slightly
savage
manner
it
amused
him
to
hear
the
girl
talking
as
if
he
were
but
a
pleasant
incident
in
her
life
when
he
intended
to
be
the
biggest
fact
that
had
ever
been
there
in
your
way
of
doing
things
pansy
you
remind
me
rather
of
myself
he
remarked
you
carrying
me
off
willy
nilly
as
i
might
be
tempted
to
carry
you
it
must
be
because
we
both
millionaires
she
replied
little
facts
of
the
sort
are
apt
to
make
one
a
trifle
she
touched
a
bell
when
a
steward
appeared
she
put
le
breton
into
his
care
leaving
the
saloon
she
went
herself
to
interview
the
captain
about
her
plans
she
was
leaning
against
the
yacht
rail
slim
and
white
with
the
breeze
blowing
her
curls
when
le
breton
joined
her
and
she
smiled
at
him
in
a
frank
boyish
fashion
as
if
their
little
difference
of
opinion
had
never
been
what
can
i
do
to
amuse
you
she
asked
i
do
need
any
amusing
when
i
with
you
he
said
you
must
say
things
like
that
raoul
she
replied
they
apt
to
make
one
decisions
wobble
for
pansy
the
morning
sped
quickly
for
le
breton
it
was
part
of
the
dream
he
had
dreamt
before
her
note
had
come
and
upset
his
calculations
making
him
rearrange
his
plans
in
a
manner
that
although
it
would
give
him
a
certain
amount
of
satisfaction
might
not
be
so
pleasing
to
the
girl
the
vessel
skirted
the
rounded
island
bringing
glimpses
of
quiet
bays
where
white
houses
nestled
rocky
cliffs
stony
barrancos
cut
deep
into
the
and
heights
there
was
a
lunch
with
attentive
stewards
hovering
in
the
background
afterwards
they
had
coffee
and
liqueurs
and
cigarettes
on
deck
an
hour
or
so
was
dawdled
away
there
then
pansy
took
her
guest
back
to
her
own
special
sanctum
he
went
over
to
the
piano
touching
a
note
here
and
there
play
me
something
she
said
for
he
touched
the
instrument
with
the
hand
of
a
music
lover
i
was
brought
up
in
the
backwoods
he
replied
and
i
never
saw
a
piano
until
i
was
nearly
nineteen
after
that
i
was
too
busy
making
money
and
doing
what
i
thought
was
enjoying
myself
to
have
time
to
go
in
for
anything
of
the
sort
but
i
like
to
listen
to
you
he
finished
willingly
pansy
seated
herself
at
the
piano
le
breton
likewise
sat
himself
in
a
deep
chair
close
by
and
gave
himself
up
to
the
delight
of
her
playing
she
wandered
from
one
song
to
another
quick
to
see
she
had
an
appreciative
audience
in
the
end
she
paused
and
glanced
at
him
as
he
sat
quiet
all
his
restless
look
gone
as
if
at
peace
with
himself
and
the
world
does
music
your
savage
breast
she
asked
it
could
never
be
savage
where
you
concerned
pansy
you
talk
as
if
i
were
quite
different
from
other
people
so
you
are
the
only
woman
i
ever
loved
when
you
talk
like
that
the
wobbling
comes
on
she
remarked
to
avoid
his
reply
she
started
playing
again
getting
to
his
feet
le
breton
went
to
the
piano
standing
behind
her
his
arms
encircling
her
he
lifted
the
small
hands
from
the
keys
and
holding
them
drew
her
back
until
her
head
rested
against
him
pansy
suppose
i
consent
to
a
six
months
engagement
the
waiting
would
be
purgatory
but
i
could
do
it
with
paradise
beyond
i
not
taking
on
any
engagements
not
for
the
next
ten
years
at
least
he
laughed
softly
and
put
the
slim
hands
back
on
the
piano
with
a
lingering
careful
touch
letting
them
pursue
their
way
whether
she
liked
it
or
not
this
lovely
wayward
girl
would
be
his
before
many
weeks
had
passed
then
he
returned
to
his
chair
and
sat
there
deep
in
some
reverie
this
time
not
planning
the
sort
of
home
he
would
make
for
her
in
paris
but
how
he
would
have
certain
rooms
in
his
palace
at
furnished
for
her
reception
a
steward
announcing
tea
brought
him
out
of
his
meditations
tea
was
served
on
deck
with
the
sun
glinting
on
the
blue
water
and
running
in
golden
cascades
down
the
together
they
watched
the
sun
set
and
saw
night
barely
shadow
the
world
when
the
moon
rose
filling
the
scene
with
silver
glory
its
white
light
led
them
back
into
harbour
and
in
its
flood
the
two
walked
to
the
hotel
together
in
the
garden
le
breton
paused
to
take
leave
of
his
hostess
just
one
kiss
heart
ease
for
the
sake
of
last
night
he
whispered
willingly
pansy
lifted
her
face
to
his
just
one
then
raoul
you
darling
since
you
been
so
nice
about
everything
as
le
breton
stooped
to
kiss
her
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
would
not
have
to
resort
to
force
in
order
to
get
the
girl
only
a
little
patience
and
persuasion
were
needed
and
he
would
win
her
in
her
own
white
english
way
chapter
xvi
along
the
deserted
corridor
of
the
big
hotel
pansy
was
hurrying
her
outing
with
le
breton
had
made
her
late
by
the
time
she
was
dressed
and
ready
dinner
was
well
started
she
went
along
quickly
still
thinking
over
the
events
of
the
day
everything
had
turned
out
exactly
as
she
had
hoped
she
wanted
to
keep
le
breton
love
and
yet
not
be
tied
in
any
way
to
have
him
in
the
background
to
marry
if
or
when
she
felt
so
disposed
in
the
full
glare
of
the
electric
light
going
down
the
wide
stairs
she
entered
the
large
patio
looking
a
picture
she
was
wearing
a
dress
of
some
yellow
gauzy
material
that
matched
her
hair
a
garment
that
clung
around
her
like
a
sunbeam
bright
and
shimmering
there
were
gold
shoes
on
her
feet
and
around
her
neck
a
long
chain
of
yellow
amber
beads
as
she
crossed
the
big
empty
hall
making
towards
the
a
man
rose
from
his
chair
the
short
man
from
whom
le
breton
had
rescued
her
a
few
nights
before
there
was
an
air
about
him
as
if
he
had
been
waiting
there
to
waylay
her
pansy
saw
him
and
she
swerved
slightly
but
beyond
that
she
gave
him
no
attention
however
he
was
not
so
easily
avoided
he
took
up
his
stand
immediately
before
her
leering
at
her
in
a
malicious
disagreeable
fashion
you
fond
of
chucking
women
in
my
teeth
he
said
go
and
chuck
at
the
fellow
you
were
spooning
with
outside
just
now
annoyed
that
the
man
should
have
witnessed
her
parting
with
le
breton
pansy
would
have
passed
without
a
word
but
he
dodged
and
was
in
front
of
her
again
at
least
she
is
my
fancy
woman
he
went
on
i
do
run
a
villa
for
her
even
if
i
do
admire
her
looks
the
weight
of
insinuation
in
his
voice
brought
the
girl
to
a
halt
what
is
it
what
do
you
want
to
say
she
asked
coldly
you
mean
to
tell
me
you
do
know
le
breton
runs
that
french
actress
lucille
lemesurier
pansy
did
not
know
nor
did
she
believe
a
word
the
man
said
how
dare
you
say
such
things
about
mr
le
breton
she
flashed
how
dare
i
indeed
he
laughed
coarsely
it
is
only
me
that
talking
about
it
everybody
knows
he
went
on
everybody
did
know
pansy
among
the
number
i
do
believe
a
word
you
say
she
said
in
an
angry
manner
do
you
all
right
trot
along
then
and
ask
the
manager
ask
anybody
they
all
talking
about
it
you
would
be
too
except
that
you
so
conceited
that
you
never
come
and
gossip
with
the
crowd
ask
who
is
running
that
villa
for
lucille
lemesurier
and
they
tell
you
it
that
high
and
mighty
french
millionaire
chap
le
breton
the
same
as
i
do
for
a
moment
pansy
just
stared
at
him
horror
and
disbelief
on
her
face
then
she
turned
quickly
away
she
did
not
go
towards
the
but
towards
the
main
entrance
of
the
hotel
she
had
never
troubled
to
make
any
inquiries
about
le
breton
she
had
liked
him
and
that
was
enough
pansy
could
not
believe
what
the
man
said
for
all
that
she
was
going
to
the
to
le
breton
to
hear
what
he
had
to
say
on
the
subject
chapter
xvii
a
flood
of
light
poured
out
from
le
breton
villa
from
french
windows
on
to
a
moonlit
lawn
around
the
house
palms
drooped
and
bamboos
whispered
the
night
was
laden
with
the
scent
of
roses
and
syringa
and
about
the
fragrant
shrubs
fireflies
glinted
like
showers
of
silver
sparks
in
one
of
the
apartments
opening
on
the
lawn
le
breton
sat
at
dinner
with
lucille
over
a
little
round
table
sparkling
with
crystal
and
gold
where
electric
lights
glowed
among
banks
of
flowers
it
was
a
large
room
lavishly
furnished
with
priceless
rugs
and
furniture
that
might
have
come
out
of
some
paris
museum
there
were
three
arab
servants
in
attendance
silent
men
well
trained
and
observant
who
waited
upon
their
master
as
if
their
lives
held
nothing
but
his
wishes
and
desires
opposite
to
him
lucille
sat
in
a
white
satin
gown
that
left
none
of
her
charms
to
the
imagination
with
the
emerald
necklace
flashing
against
her
skin
she
was
talking
in
a
soft
languid
voice
sometimes
witty
often
suggestive
but
never
at
a
loss
for
a
subject
as
women
do
talk
who
are
paid
well
to
interest
and
amuse
their
masters
le
breton
did
not
look
either
particularly
interested
or
amused
in
fact
he
looked
bored
and
indifferent
answering
her
in
monosyllables
as
if
her
perpetual
chatter
interrupted
some
pleasant
reverie
of
his
own
as
he
sat
intent
on
his
own
thoughts
one
of
the
servants
came
to
his
side
stooping
he
said
in
a
deferential
voice
in
arabic
there
is
the
english
lady
your
highness
deigned
to
breakfast
with
in
the
orange
groves
of
telde
le
breton
started
he
glanced
round
his
gaze
following
the
arab
to
one
of
the
wide
french
windows
opening
on
the
lawn
standing
there
light
and
slight
a
graceful
golden
reed
was
the
girl
who
was
now
all
the
world
to
him
but
pansy
was
not
looking
in
his
direction
but
at
lucille
as
if
she
could
not
believe
what
she
saw
before
her
the
sight
brought
le
breton
quickly
to
his
feet
pansy
he
exclaimed
his
voice
and
action
made
lucille
glance
towards
the
window
she
looked
at
the
girl
standing
there
then
she
smiled
lazily
a
trifle
maliciously
lucille
saw
before
her
the
rival
she
had
suspected
who
had
changed
le
breton
lukewarm
liking
into
cutting
indifference
with
the
perception
of
her
kind
she
realised
that
pansy
was
something
quite
different
from
herself
and
the
women
le
breton
usually
amused
himself
with
that
slim
girl
with
her
wide
purple
eyes
and
vivid
face
was
no
courtesan
no
toy
but
a
woman
with
a
spirit
and
a
soul
that
could
hold
and
draw
a
man
apart
from
her
physical
attractions
the
sort
of
woman
in
fact
that
a
man
like
raoul
le
breton
might
be
tempted
to
marry
at
sound
of
his
voice
pansy
came
into
the
room
her
eyes
blazing
her
breast
heaving
her
two
hands
clutching
the
long
amber
chain
in
an
effort
to
keep
herself
calm
and
collected
so
it
was
true
he
was
living
here
with
that
creature
this
man
who
had
come
to
her
vowing
she
was
the
only
woman
he
had
ever
loved
this
man
whom
she
had
kissed
and
whom
she
had
allowed
to
kiss
and
fondle
her
pansy
looked
at
lucille
in
her
white
satin
and
emeralds
lucille
big
and
voluptuous
her
profession
written
on
her
face
who
is
that
woman
she
demanded
lucille
did
not
wait
for
le
breton
to
answer
one
glance
at
him
told
her
everything
on
his
face
were
concern
love
and
annoyance
the
look
that
comes
to
a
man
face
when
the
girl
he
would
make
his
wife
and
the
woman
who
is
his
mistress
by
some
unfortunate
circumstance
chance
to
meet
her
star
never
particularly
bright
had
waned
and
set
within
a
week
all
thanks
to
this
slim
girl
in
the
yellow
dress
any
day
she
lucille
might
be
shipped
back
to
france
with
only
the
emerald
necklace
to
soothe
her
sore
heart
as
things
were
she
could
lose
nothing
and
she
might
have
the
pleasure
of
parting
le
breton
from
the
woman
he
really
loved
the
girl
looked
one
who
would
countenance
no
backslidings
before
he
could
say
anything
she
said
in
a
languid
voice
my
name
is
lucille
lemesurier
i
an
actress
at
mr
le
invitation
i
came
here
with
him
from
paris
to
stay
until
he
tires
of
me
or
i
of
him
vous
she
finished
with
a
shrug
for
a
moment
pansy
just
stared
at
the
truth
confronting
her
the
truth
lazy
languid
and
smiling
in
white
satin
and
emeralds
there
was
a
little
noise
hard
and
sharp
like
a
shower
of
frozen
tears
rattling
down
on
the
table
the
hands
clinging
to
the
string
of
amber
beads
clung
just
a
thought
too
hard
for
the
necklace
snapped
suddenly
the
beads
poured
down
like
tears
the
tears
pansy
herself
was
past
shedding
the
knowledge
of
le
breton
treachery
and
deceit
had
turned
her
into
ice
she
cast
one
look
at
him
of
utter
contempt
and
scorn
then
silently
as
she
had
come
she
turned
and
went
from
the
room
she
did
not
get
far
however
before
le
breton
was
at
her
side
ignoring
him
she
hurried
across
the
moonlit
lawn
her
only
desire
to
escape
from
his
presence
pansy
he
began
like
a
whirlwind
she
turned
on
him
with
a
hand
that
shook
with
rage
she
pointed
to
the
open
window
go
go
back
to
that
creature
she
said
in
a
voice
that
trembled
with
anger
i
never
want
to
see
or
speak
to
you
again
never
at
her
words
le
breton
hands
clenched
and
his
swarthy
face
went
white
do
you
think
i
going
to
be
dismissed
in
this
manner
he
asked
in
a
strangled
voice
without
a
further
word
pansy
would
have
hurried
on
but
before
she
knew
what
was
happening
he
had
taken
her
into
his
arms
how
dare
you
touch
me
how
dare
you
touch
me
she
gasped
struggling
furiously
after
freedom
amazed
at
his
audacity
but
he
laughed
and
crushing
her
against
him
kissed
her
fiercely
le
breton
knew
his
case
was
hopeless
no
amount
of
persuasion
would
bring
the
girl
back
to
his
arms
he
was
no
longer
a
polished
man
of
the
world
but
the
sultan
of
a
barbaric
ruler
who
knew
no
law
save
his
own
desire
pansy
was
too
furious
to
be
afraid
with
all
her
might
she
struggled
to
get
away
from
his
arms
and
the
deluge
of
hot
passionate
kisses
not
because
of
the
danger
oozing
from
the
man
but
because
she
knew
he
had
held
and
kissed
that
other
woman
but
all
her
struggles
were
in
vain
she
was
helpless
against
his
strength
crushed
within
his
arms
almost
breathless
under
the
force
and
passion
of
the
kisses
she
could
not
escape
from
if
you
go
on
behaving
in
this
brutal
manner
i
shall
scream
she
panted
presently
her
words
sobered
him
the
road
lay
not
twenty
yards
away
and
her
screams
might
bring
a
dozen
people
to
her
rescue
he
remembered
that
he
was
in
grand
canary
where
even
had
to
conform
with
rules
not
in
where
none
would
dare
question
his
doings
he
let
pansy
out
of
his
arms
look
what
a
state
you
put
me
in
she
flashed
the
moment
she
was
free
as
she
endeavoured
to
tidy
her
torn
and
crumpled
dress
with
hands
that
shook
with
anger
you
a
brute
a
savage
i
hate
you
she
finished
but
le
breton
just
stood
and
laughed
she
might
go
but
she
would
be
on
his
yacht
where
she
might
scream
to
her
heart
content
without
a
soul
coming
to
her
rescue
his
laughter
fierce
and
fond
followed
pansy
from
the
garden
chapter
xviii
the
hotel
patio
was
full
of
people
just
out
from
dinner
in
the
midst
of
a
crowd
of
acquaintances
captain
cameron
stood
laughing
and
talking
with
those
around
him
all
at
once
a
voice
at
his
elbow
said
tensely
bob
i
want
to
speak
to
you
alone
for
a
moment
he
turned
quickly
then
he
stood
surveying
the
speaker
with
surprise
for
the
girl
beside
him
looked
very
different
from
the
pansy
he
knew
there
was
an
almost
tortured
air
about
her
her
face
was
set
and
white
there
were
deep
dark
rings
under
eyes
that
were
limpid
pools
of
pain
hello
old
pal
what
has
happened
he
asked
with
concern
pansy
did
not
stop
to
answer
him
with
impatient
hands
she
led
him
away
from
the
crowd
of
listening
staring
people
into
a
quiet
corner
i
going
back
to
england
at
once
help
me
to
get
off
please
she
said
with
blank
amazement
cameron
stared
at
her
what
got
hold
of
you
now
he
managed
to
ask
i
going
home
she
said
at
once
but
i
thought
you
were
staying
here
until
sir
george
came
out
well
i
changed
my
mind
she
snapped
and
i
going
back
even
if
you
are
all
pansy
wanted
now
was
to
get
to
the
one
other
man
she
loved
her
father
to
get
to
him
as
quickly
as
possible
with
her
bruised
and
wounded
heart
of
course
i
come
with
you
old
girl
cameron
said
a
trifle
helplessly
i
would
dream
of
leaving
you
in
the
lurch
but
you
have
a
way
of
springing
surprises
on
people
i
send
along
and
tell
the
captain
to
get
steam
up
yes
do
bob
please
she
said
gratefully
and
ask
miss
grainger
to
see
about
the
packing
and
find
out
where
jenkins
is
and
send
him
along
to
the
stables
i
i
past
doing
anything
cameron
scanned
the
girl
quickly
suddenly
aware
that
something
more
than
a
whim
was
at
the
bottom
of
her
hurried
departure
what
is
it
pansy
he
asked
nothing
she
answered
bravely
but
i
get
moods
when
i
just
feel
i
must
see
my
old
dad
she
turned
away
quickly
to
avoid
any
further
questions
leaving
cameron
staring
at
her
receding
back
chapter
xix
the
next
morning
le
breton
set
about
his
scheme
for
trapping
pansy
the
task
appeared
easy
he
would
get
one
of
his
men
to
note
when
she
left
the
hotel
and
mark
which
route
she
took
there
were
not
many
roads
in
the
place
and
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
guess
where
she
was
going
he
and
his
men
would
follow
and
waylay
and
capture
her
at
some
lonely
spot
they
would
take
her
across
the
island
to
a
little
port
on
the
far
side
where
his
yacht
would
be
waiting
once
he
had
her
safely
on
board
he
would
start
for
africa
as
he
sat
at
breakfast
savage
and
brooding
craving
for
the
girl
who
had
flouted
him
one
of
his
servants
entered
well
he
asked
glaring
at
the
man
the
arab
made
a
deep
obeisance
your
highness
the
english
lady
has
gone
gone
the
sultan
repeated
in
an
incredulous
tone
gone
where
she
left
the
island
last
night
in
her
yacht
about
two
hours
after
she
was
here
like
one
thunderstruck
le
breton
stared
at
the
arab
this
unexpected
move
of
pansy
had
upset
his
calculations
altogether
without
a
word
he
rose
from
the
table
there
and
then
he
went
over
to
the
hotel
to
see
the
manager
his
only
idea
to
find
out
where
the
girl
had
gone
he
could
not
believe
that
she
had
escaped
him
yet
the
mere
thought
that
she
might
have
done
so
filled
him
with
a
seething
passion
by
the
time
he
reached
the
hotel
he
had
recovered
himself
in
some
degree
sufficiently
to
inquire
in
a
normal
tone
for
the
manager
he
was
taken
to
the
latter
office
you
had
an
english
lady
staying
here
a
miss
langham
le
breton
said
the
moment
he
was
ushered
in
i
wanted
to
see
her
rather
particularly
but
i
hear
she
has
left
can
you
tell
me
where
gone
on
seeing
who
the
visitor
was
the
manager
was
anxious
to
give
all
possible
assistance
but
he
knew
little
more
about
pansy
than
le
breton
did
she
left
rather
hurriedly
he
said
and
as
far
as
i
could
gather
she
was
going
back
to
england
do
you
know
her
address
there
le
breton
asked
no
i
do
the
manager
said
regretfully
miss
langham
did
not
talk
much
about
herself
this
was
all
le
breton
was
able
to
learn
but
he
knew
one
thing
that
the
girl
his
fierce
heart
hungered
for
had
escaped
him
that
morning
his
black
horse
had
a
hard
time
for
le
breton
rode
like
a
madman
in
a
vain
endeavour
to
get
away
from
the
whirl
of
wild
love
and
thwarted
hopes
that
raged
within
him

casim
ammeh
for
the
first
time
deprived
of
the
woman
he
wanted
wanted
as
he
had
never
wanted
any
other
he
went
to
the
where
pansy
had
been
pleased
to
linger
with
him
to
the
orange
groves
at
telde
where
they
had
breakfasted
together
night
found
him
in
the
hotel
gardens
near
the
fountain
where
they
had
met
and
plighted
their
troth
his
hands
clenched
at
the
thought
of
all
she
had
promised
there
she
haunted
him
her
ghost
was
in
his
arms
kissing
and
teasing
him
a
recollection
that
was
torture
the
one
real
love
of
his
life
had
proved
but
dead
sea
fruit
he
would
have
given
his
kingdom
all
his
riches
to
have
pansy
back
in
his
arms
as
he
had
had
her
that
night
unresisting
watching
him
with
eyes
full
of
love
wanting
him
as
much
as
he
had
wanted
her
the
one
woman
who
had
ever
scorned
him

governor
although
his
thoughts
just
then
were
in
gambia
the
incident
of
the
shooting
of
the
sultan
casim
ammeh
had
long
since
gone
from
his
mind
and
he
never
gave
a
thought
nowadays
to
the
boy
who
unavailingly
had
come
to
the
arab
chief
rescue
but
he
still
carried
the
mark
of
the
youngster
sword
upon
his
cheek
the
passing
years
had
changed
barclay
very
little
his
hair
was
grey
his
face
thinner
and
a
studious
look
now
lurked
in
the
grey
eyes
where
tragedy
had
once
been
for
in
his
profession
barclay
had
found
some
of
the
forgetfulness
he
had
set
out
in
search
of
as
he
sat
at
his
desk
the
door
opened
suddenly
the
manner
of
opening
told
him
that
the
daughter
he
imagined
to
be
a
thousand
or
more
miles
away
was
home
again
for
no
one
save
this
cherished
legacy
from
his
lost
love
would
enter
his
study
with
such
lack
of
ceremony
he
looked
round
quickly
as
a
slim
girl
in
ermine
and
purple
velvet
entered
why
pansy
my
darling
i
thought
you
were
in
grand
canary
he
said
rising
quickly
to
greet
her
so
i
was
father
five
days
ago
and
then
and
then
she
paused
and
laughing
in
a
rather
forced
manner
kissed
him
affectionately
father
will
you
take
me
out
to
gambia
with
you
she
finished
there
was
very
little
george
barclay
ever
refused
his
daughter
on
this
occasion
he
did
make
some
sort
of
stand
gambia
is
no
place
for
you
my
darling
there
nothing
there
to
amuse
and
interest
a
young
girl
perhaps
not
pansy
said
as
she
took
off
her
hat
and
gloves
watching
him
with
a
rather
set
smile
but
i
do
care
where
i
go
so
long
as
i
can
be
with
you
and
get
away
from
myself
her
words
made
barclay
look
at
her
sharply
to
want
to
get
away
from
one
self
was
a
feeling
he
could
understand
and
sympathise
with
only
too
well
but
to
hear
such
a
sentiment
on
his
daughter
lips
surprised
and
hurt
him
my
little
girl
what
has
happened
he
asked
gently
pansy
laughed
again
but
there
was
a
sharp
catch
of
pain
in
her
mirth
i
think
my
heart
is
broken
that
all
she
said
with
a
casual
air
barclay
did
not
wait
to
hear
any
more
at
that
moment
he
drew
her
down
on
to
a
couch
and
sat
there
with
his
arm
about
her
my
poor
little
girl
he
whispered
tell
me
all
about
it
pansy
laid
her
head
on
his
shoulder
and
smiled
at
him
with
lips
that
trembled
woefully
it
nobody
fault
but
my
own
daddy
she
said
i
brought
it
on
myself
with
my
silly
impetuous
ways
and
it
serves
me
right
for
hankering
after
strange
men
and
not
being
content
with
my
old
father
for
all
her
light
talk
barclay
knew
something
serious
had
happened
to
him
his
daughter
was
but
a
new
edition
of
a
book
the
girl
was
her
mother
over
again
there
was
a
brief
pause
as
sir
george
sat
watching
his
child
stroking
her
curls
with
a
thin
affectionate
hand
wondering
what
tragedy
had
come
into
this
bright
young
life
hearts
are
silly
things
are
they
pansy
said
suddenly
soft
flabby
squashy
sort
of
things
that
get
hurt
easily
if
you
do
keep
a
sharp
eye
on
them
and
i
so
many
things
to
keep
an
eye
on
that
i
forgot
all
about
mine
hearts
ought
not
to
be
left
without
protection
they
should
have
iron
rails
put
round
them
to
keep
all
trespassers
off
like
the
rails
we
put
round
the
trees
in
the
park
to
keep
the
cattle
from
hurting
them
there
was
a
further
pause
and
a
little
sniff
then
pansy
said
father
lend
me
your
handkerchief
i
know
it
a
nice
big
one
i
believe
i
going
to
cry
for
the
first
time
since
it
happened
it
must
be
seeing
you
again
and
i
shall
cry
a
lot
on
your
coat
and
perhaps
spoil
it
but
since
it
me
i
know
you
wo
mind
sir
george
drew
out
a
handkerchief
i
was
walking
along
in
heaven
with
my
head
up
and
my
nose
in
the
air
the
sweet
hurt
voice
explained
blissfully
happy
because
he
was
there
there
was
a
hole
in
the
floor
of
heaven
and
i
never
saw
it
and
i
fell
right
through
crash
bang
right
down
to
earth
again
a
rotten
old
earth
with
all
the
fun
gone
out
of
it
and
i
awfully
sore
and
bruised
and
the
shock
has
injured
my
heart
it
has
never
been
the
same
since
and
will
never
be
the
same
again
because
because
i
did
love
him
awfully
as
she
talked
sir
george
watched
her
with
affection
and
concern
his
heart
aching
for
this
slim
beautiful
daughter
of
his
to
whom
love
had
come
as
a
tragedy
oh
daddy
she
said
tears
choking
her
voice
why
is
life
so
hard
then
the
storm
broke
sir
george
listened
to
her
sobs
as
with
a
gentle
hand
he
stroked
the
golden
curls
all
the
time
he
wondered
who
was
responsible
for
her
tears
who
had
broken
the
heart
of
his
cherished
daughter
he
went
over
the
multitude
of
men
she
knew
but
he
never
gave
one
thought
to
the
savage
boy
who
sixteen
years
before
had
scarred
his
face
the
sultan
casim
ammeh
chapter
xxi
in
a
fashionable
london
hotel
a
little
party
of
three
sat
at
dinner
the
was
a
large
place
full
of
people
it
was
bright
with
electric
light
and
under
a
cover
of
greenery
a
band
played
not
too
loudly
among
the
crowd
of
diners
none
seemed
better
known
than
the
girl
with
the
short
golden
curls
who
sat
with
the
thin
man
and
the
boy
very
often
lorgnettes
were
turned
in
her
direction
for
when
in
town
no
girl
was
more
sought
after
than
pansy
langham
as
pansy
sat
with
her
father
and
captain
cameron
a
man
who
had
been
sitting
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
came
to
their
table
greeting
all
three
with
the
air
of
an
old
acquaintance
afterwards
he
turned
to
cameron
well
and
how
tennis
are
you
still
champion
in
your
own
little
way
he
asked
to
tell
you
the
truth
dennis
cameron
answered
in
grand
canary
one
man
gave
me
a
thorough
licking
and
he
was
a
rank
outsider
too
how
pleased
you
must
have
felt
who
was
your
executioner
a
man
of
the
name
of
le
breton
a
french
millionaire
dennis
laughed
in
a
disparaging
manner
french
he
calls
himself
does
he
that
like
his
cheek
i
met
him
once
in
paris
a
haughty
sort
of
customer
who
thinks
the
whole
world
is
run
for
him
he
a
really
for
all
his
money
and
his
ways
the
conversation
had
taken
a
turn
that
held
a
fearsome
interest
for
pansy
but
to
hear
raoul
le
breton
described
as
a
was
a
shock
and
surprise
to
her
mr
le
breton
a
she
exclaimed
dennis
glanced
at
her
where
did
you
drop
across
him
he
asked
sharply
in
grand
canary
also
well
the
less
you
have
to
do
with
the
better
he
said
in
a
brotherly
way
he
a
hot
lot
the
very
devil
no
sort
of
a
pal
for
a
girl
like
you
i
thought
he
was
french
pansy
said
in
a
strained
voice
he
poses
as
such
but
he
is
he
a
nigger
cross
and
what
more
he
a
mohammedan
you
a
trifle
sweeping
dennis
sir
george
interposed
if
dealt
with
coloured
people
as
much
as
i
have
you
know
there
was
a
great
difference
between
a
nigger
and
an
arab
an
arab
in
his
own
way
is
a
gentleman
and
his
religion
has
a
great
resemblance
to
our
own
he
is
not
a
naked
like
the
negro
pansy
welcomed
her
father
intervention
at
that
moment
her
world
was
crashing
into
even
greater
ruins
around
her
raoul
le
breton
a
the
man
she
loved
a
nigger
pansy
did
not
hide
from
herself
the
fact
that
she
still
loved
le
breton
but
this
last
piece
of
news
about
him
put
him
quite
beyond
the
pale
also
it
put
a
new
light
on
the
affair
of
lucille
lemesurier
he
was
of
a
different
race
a
different
religion
a
different
colour
with
a
wholly
different
outlook
after
the
first
gust
of
temper
was
over
pansy
had
wanted
to
find
some
excuse
for
le
breton
over
the
affair
of
the
french
actress
it
is
easy
to
find
excuses
for
a
person
when
one
is
anxious
to
find
them
and
now
it
seemed
she
had
one
he
was
a
mohammedan
his
religion
allowed
him
four
wives
and
as
many
other
women
as
he
pleased
no
wonder
he
had
been
angry
at
the
fuss
she
had
made
over
lucille
lemesurier
according
to
his
code
he
had
done
no
wrong
now
pansy
wanted
to
apologise
for
her
rudeness
in
invading
his
villa
for
her
temper
and
the
scene
that
followed
the
fault
was
all
hers
she
ought
to
have
found
out
more
about
him
before
letting
things
go
so
far
she
had
liked
him
and
she
had
troubled
about
nothing
else
she
ought
never
to
have
encouraged
him
for
when
they
had
breakfasted
together
that
morning
among
the
red
roses
she
knew
he
was
in
love
with
her
there
are
lots
of
things
about
myself
i
have
told
you
le
breton
remark
came
back
to
her
mind
no
wonder
he
had
wanted
to
marry
her
at
once
before
she
found
out
anything
about
him
pansy
tried
to
feel
angry
with
her
erstwhile
lover
but
the
strength
of
his
arms
was
around
her
his
handsome
sunburnt
face
was
close
to
her
own
his
voice
was
whispering
words
of
love
and
longing
his
lips
on
hers
in
those
passionate
kisses
that
made
her
forget
everything
but
himself
her
eyes
went
round
the
room
a
brave
tortured
look
in
them
were
there
other
women
there
suffering
as
she
was
suffering
suffering
and
who
yet
had
to
go
on
smiling
the
world
demanded
her
smiles
and
it
should
have
them
although
her
heart
was
bleeding
at
the
tragedy
of
her
own
making
not
only
her
heart
but
raoul
because
she
had
encouraged
him
she
must
not
blame
him
for
the
odds
were
all
against
him
she
must
try
and
see
things
from
his
point
of
view
the
point
of
view
of
a
polygamist
that
night
when
pansy
got
back
home
she
wrote
the
following
note
dear
mr
le
breton
i
owe
you
an
apology
only
i
have
learnt
that
you
are
of
another
race
another
religion
than
mine
it
makes
things
look
quite
different
you
see
things
from
the
point
of
view
of
your
race
i
of
mine
i
am
sorry
i
did
not
know
all
this
sooner
i
should
have
acted
very
differently
i
should
not
have
come
to
your
villa
that
night
and
made
a
stupid
fuss
for
one
thing
about
such
matters
men
of
your
race
and
religion
are
quite
different
from
men
of
my
own
i
am
sorry
for
all
that
occurred
for
my
own
bad
temper
and
the
annoyance
i
must
have
caused
you
but
i
did
not
know
anything
about
you
then
yours
regretfully
pansy
langham
i
shall
be
calling
at
grand
canary
in
about
ten
days
time
with
my
father
sir
george
barclay
i
am
going
out
to
africa
with
him
if
you
care
to
come
on
board
during
the
evening
i
should
like
to
see
you
and
say
how
sorry
i
am
chapter
xxii
one
day
when
le
breton
returned
from
one
of
the
mad
rides
he
frequently
indulged
in
in
a
vain
effort
to
assuage
the
pain
and
chagrin
that
raged
within
him
he
found
among
a
pile
of
letters
put
aside
for
his
inspection
one
with
an
english
stamp
letters
from
that
country
rarely
came
his
way
but
it
was
not
the
novelty
that
attracted
him
making
him
pick
it
out
from
the
others
but
the
writing
he
had
seen
it
once
before
on
a
note
that
had
turned
his
heaven
into
hell
when
for
the
first
time
he
had
learnt
what
it
was
to
be
rejected
by
a
woman
he
tore
the
envelope
open
eager
for
the
contents
what
had
the
girl
to
say
to
him
why
had
she
written
with
a
wild
throb
of
hope
he
drew
out
the
message
once
he
had
called
pansy
a
little
creature
of
rare
surprises
but
none
equalled
the
surprise
in
store
for
him
now
it
was
not
the
apologies
in
the
note
he
saw
nor
a
girl
desire
to
try
and
see
things
from
his
point
of
view
nor
the
fact
that
despite
everything
she
was
unable
to
break
away
from
him
he
saw
only
one
thing
she
was
sir
george
barclay
daughter
the
girl
he
loved
to
distraction
was
the
child
of
his
father
murderer
astounded
he
stared
at
the
note
he
could
not
believe
it
yet
it
was
there
written
in
pansy
own
hand
with
my
father
sir
george
barclay
pansy
the
child
of
the
man
he
hated
that
brave
kind
slim
teasing
girl
who
for
one
brief
week
had
filled
him
with
a
happiness
and
love
and
contentment
such
as
he
had
once
deemed
impossible
as
he
brooded
on
the
note
a
variety
of
emotions
raged
within
him
a
vengeance
that
had
rankled
for
sixteen
years
fought
with
a
love
that
had
grown
up
in
a
week
then
he
pulled
himself
together
as
if
amazed
at
his
own
indecision
he
took
the
note
with
its
pathos
and
pleading
a
girl
endeavour
to
meet
the
view
of
the
man
she
loved
whose
outlook
was
quite
beyond
her
deliberately
he
tore
it
across
and
across
into
shreds
slowly
and
with
a
cruel
look
on
his
face
as
if
it
were
something
alive
that
he
was
torturing
and
that
gave
him
pleasure
to
torture
for
le
breton
had
decided
what
his
course
was
to
be
the
vengeance
he
had
promised
long
years
ago
should
be
carried
out
with
slight
alterations
he
had
a
way
now
of
torturing
sir
george
barclay
that
would
be
punishment
beyond
any
death
and
pansy
was
the
tool
he
intended
to
use
what
was
more
she
was
to
pay
the
penalty
of
her
father
crime
for
he
would
mete
out
to
her
the
measure
he
had
promised
sixteen
years
ago
however
this
decision
did
not
prevent
le
breton
from
going
to
yacht
the
evening
of
its
arrival
in
grand
canary
after
dinner
he
made
his
way
along
the
quay
towards
the
white
vessel
with
its
flare
of
light
that
stood
out
against
the
dark
night
evidently
he
was
expected
on
inquiring
for
miss
langham
he
was
shown
into
the
cabin
where
he
had
had
his
previous
interview
with
her
and
with
the
feeling
that
things
would
go
his
way
if
he
had
but
a
little
patience
a
virtue
he
had
never
been
called
upon
to
exercise
where
a
woman
was
concerned
le
breton
feelings
as
he
stayed
on
in
the
pretty
cabin
would
be
difficult
to
describe
everything
was
redolent
of
the
girl
touching
his
heart
with
fairy
fingers
a
heart
he
had
hardened
against
her
but
as
he
waited
there
he
despised
himself
for
even
having
momentarily
contemplated
letting
a
woman
come
between
him
and
his
cherished
vengeance
once
in
africa
sir
george
barclay
would
prove
an
easy
and
unsuspecting
prey
according
to
custom
the
governor
should
tour
his
province
that
tour
would
bring
him
within
six
hundred
miles
of
le
desert
kingdom
the
latter
intended
to
keep
himself
well
posted
in
his
enemy
movements
and
he
knew
exactly
the
spot
where
he
would
wait
for
the
governor
and
his
suite
the
spot
where
sixteen
years
before
the
sultan
casim
ammeh
had
been
shot
he
le
breton
would
wait
near
there
with
a
troop
of
his
arab
soldiers
unsuspecting
the
governor
would
walk
into
the
trap
the
whole
party
would
be
captured
with
a
completeness
and
unexpectedness
that
would
leave
no
trace
of
what
had
happened
with
his
prisoners
he
would
sweep
back
to
the
desert
once
in

slave
in

public
market
to
become
the
property
of
any
arab
or
negro
chief
who
fancied
her
and
her
father
should
see
her
sold
but
he
should
not
be
killed
afterwards
he
should
live
on
to
brood
over
his
child
fate
a
torture
worse
than
any
death
put
your
ear
quite
close
it
not
a
matter
that
can
be
shouted
from
the
like
a
sign
from
the
sea
the
echo
of
pansy
voice
whispered
in
his
ear
a
breath
from
his
one
night
in
heaven
but
he
would
not
listen
vengeance
had
stifled
love
vengeance
he
had
waited
sixteen
years
for
he
glanced
round
with
set
cold
face
it
seemed
to
him
no
other
woman
could
look
so
lovely
and
desirable
as
the
girl
entering
pansy
was
wearing
a
flounced
dress
of
some
soft
pink
silky
material
that
spread
around
her
like
the
petals
of
a
flower
the
one
great
diamond
sparkled
on
her
breast
a
dewdrop
in
the
heart
of
a
rose
on
seeing
her
le
breton
caught
his
breath
sharply
this
girl
the
daughter
of
his
father
murderer
this
lovely
english
rose
what
a
trick
fate
had
played
him
then
ashamed
of
his
momentary
craving
he
faced
her
a
cruel
smile
on
his
lips
there
was
a
brief
silence
pansy
looked
at
him
thinking
she
had
never
seen
him
so
handsome
so
proud
so
aloof
so
hard
as
now
he
stood
watching
her
coldly
with
no
word
of
welcome
no
greeting
on
his
lips
he
was
the
first
to
speak
and
he
said
none
of
the
things
pansy
was
expecting
and
was
prepared
for
why
did
you
tell
me
your
name
was
langham
he
asked
in
a
peremptory
manner
it
is
langham
she
answered
with
some
surprise
how
is
it
then
that
you
say
sir
george
barclay
is
your
father
he
is
my
father
langham
was
my
godfather
name
my
own
second
name
i
had
to
take
it
when
i
inherited
his
money
that
was
his
one
stipulation
another
pause
ensued
there
was
a
hurt
look
in
pansy
soft
eyes
as
she
watched
le
breton
as
he
looked
back
at
her
a
hungry
gleam
came
to
his
hard
ones
what
have
you
learnt
about
me
he
demanded
presently
that
you
half
arab
he
had
almost
expected
her
to
say
she
had
discovered
he
was
the
sultan
casim
ammeh
her
own
and
her
father
sworn
enemy
is
that
all
he
asked
with
a
savage
laugh
it
quite
enough
to
account
for
everything
pansy
replied
even
for
your
coming
into
my
arms
and
letting
me
kiss
and
caress
you
he
said
with
biting
sarcasm
pansy
flushed
i
did
know
anything
about
you
then
and
you
know
i
did
she
said
with
indignation
or
you
would
have
listened
to
a
word
of
love
from
me
much
as
he
tried
to
hate
the
girl
now
that
he
was
with
her
he
could
not
keep
the
word
love
off
his
lips
pansy
felt
she
was
not
shining
she
wanted
to
apologise
but
he
seemed
determined
to
be
disagreeable
what
was
more
she
had
a
feeling
she
was
dealing
with
quite
a
different
man
from
the
raoul
le
breton
who
had
won
and
broken
her
heart
within
a
week
she
put
it
down
to
her
own
treatment
of
him
and
it
made
her
all
the
more
anxious
for
an
understanding
she
could
not
bear
to
see
him
looking
at
her
in
that
hard
cruel
way
as
if
she
were
his
mortal
enemy
someone
who
had
injured
him
past
all
forgiveness
it
not
that
i
want
to
talk
about
at
all
she
said
desperately
what
do
you
want
to
talk
about
then
he
asked
his
cruel
smile
deepening
i
want
to
say
how
sorry
i
am
that
i
was
angry
with
you
that
night
but
i
i
did
know
you
were
are
pansy
stopped
before
she
got
deeper
into
the
mire
she
was
going
to
say
a
coloured
man
but
with
him
standing
before
her
her
lips
refused
to
form
the
words
however
le
breton
finished
the
sentence
for
her
nigger
do
spare
my
feelings
i
had
it
cast
up
at
me
before
by
you
english
you
know
i
would
say
anything
so
cruel
and
untrue
again
there
was
silence
le
breton
watched
her
torturing
himself
with
the
thought
of
what
might
have
been
if
you
kept
your
word
you
be
my
wife
now
the
wife
of
nigger
he
said
presently
do
be
so
cruel
i
never
thought
you
be
like
this
she
cried
her
voice
full
of
pain
and
i
never
thought
you
would
break
your
word
in
any
case
i
could
have
married
you
considering
you
a
mohammedan
she
said
goaded
out
of
all
patience
by
his
unfriendly
attitude
religion
is
nothing
to
me
nowadays
i
was
quite
prepared
to
change
to
yours
you
could
have
done
that
there
would
be
your
your
wives
to
consider
i
have
no
wife
by
my
religion
or
yours
but
that
woman
at
your
villa
was
she
pansy
began
i
half
a
dozen
women
in
one
of
my
houses
but
none
of
them
are
my
wives
you
the
only
woman
i
ever
asked
for
in
marriage
you
he
laughed
in
a
cruel
hard
way
as
if
at
some
devil
joke
pansy
hand
went
to
her
head
a
weary
hopeless
gesture
he
was
beyond
her
comprehension
this
man
who
calmly
confessed
to
having
a
half
a
dozen
women
in
one
of
his
houses
to
a
woman
he
would
have
made
his
wife
i
sorry
she
said
in
a
dreary
tone
but
i
ca
understand
you
i
no
idea
there
were
men
who
seemed
just
like
other
men
and
yet
behaved
in
this
this
extraordinary
fashion
i
not
aware
that
my
behaviour
is
extraordinary
every
man
in
my
country
has
a
harem
if
he
can
afford
it
deliberately
he
put
these
facts
before
the
girl
in
his
desire
to
hurt
and
hate
her
as
he
hated
her
father
but
the
look
of
suffering
on
her
face
hurt
him
as
much
as
he
was
hurting
her
and
he
hated
himself
more
than
he
hated
her
because
uprooting
the
love
he
had
for
her
out
of
his
heart
was
proving
such
a
difficult
task
it
a
harem
is
it
pansy
said
distastefully
now
i
beginning
to
understand
but
i
do
want
to
hear
anything
more
about
it
i
see
now
it
was
a
mistake
my
asking
you
here
but
i
wanted
you
to
know
to
know
she
floundered
and
stopped
and
started
again
anxious
to
be
fair
with
him
in
spite
of
everything
i
wanted
you
to
understand
that
the
fact
of
your
religion
and
race
made
your
behaviour
seem
quite
different
from
what
it
would
have
been
were
you
a
a
european
i
want
you
to
see
that
i
know
you
have
your
point
of
view
that
i
ca
in
all
fairness
blame
you
for
doing
what
is
not
wrong
according
to
your
standpoint
even
if
it
is
according
to
mine
with
his
cold
cruel
smile
deepening
he
watched
her
floundering
after
excuses
for
him
endeavouring
to
see
his
point
of
view
to
be
just
and
fair
you
very
magnanimous
he
said
with
biting
scorn
and
you
are
very
unkind
she
flashed
suddenly
out
of
patience
you
making
everything
as
hard
for
me
as
you
possibly
can
doing
it
deliberately
and
you
look
as
if
you
enjoyed
hurting
me
i
never
thought
you
be
like
this
raoul
i
would
have
liked
to
part
as
friends
since
since
anything
else
is
impossible
his
name
on
her
lips
made
a
spasm
cross
le
breton
face
as
he
stood
there
fighting
against
himself
he
knew
he
was
still
madly
in
love
with
the
girl
he
was
determined
to
hate
and
he
despised
himself
for
his
own
weakness
pansy
watched
him
a
look
of
suppressed
suffering
shadowing
her
eyes
she
would
have
given
all
she
possessed
her
cherished
freedom
her
vast
riches
her
life
to
have
had
him
as
she
once
thought
him
a
man
of
her
own
colour
not
with
this
dreadful
black
barrier
between
them
a
tragedy
so
ghastly
that
the
fact
of
lucille
lemesurier
now
seemed
a
laughing
matter
he
was
lost
to
her
for
ever
no
amount
of
love
or
understanding
could
pull
down
that
barrier
she
said
holding
out
her
hand
i
sorry
we
ever
dropped
across
one
another
le
breton
made
no
reply
cold
and
unsmiling
he
watched
her
there
was
a
brief
silence
outside
the
sea
sobbed
and
splashed
like
tears
against
the
side
but
all
the
tears
in
the
world
could
not
wash
the
black
stain
from
him
as
they
stood
looking
at
one
another
a
verse
came
and
sang
like
a
dirge
in
pansy
head
what
are
we
waiting
for
oh
my
heart
kiss
me
straight
on
the
brow
and
part
again
again
my
heart
my
heart
what
are
we
waiting
for
you
and
i
a
pleading
look
a
stifled
cry
for
ever
she
said
again
then
he
smiled
his
cold
cruel
smile
no
pansy
i
say
au
revoir
ignoring
her
outstretched
hand
he
bowed
then
after
one
long
look
at
her
he
turned
and
was
gone
as
the
door
closed
behind
him
pansy
blinked
back
two
tears
it
had
hurt
her
horribly
to
see
him
so
set
and
cold
with
that
cruel
look
in
his
eyes
where
love
once
had
been
she
wished
that
the
sultan
had
killed
her
that
day
in
the
east
end
of
london
or
that
raoul
le
breton
had
been
drowned
that
night
in
the
sea
anything
rather
than
that
they
should
have
met
to
make
each
other
suffer
part
iii
chapter
i
over
great
stars
flashed
like
silver
lamps
in
the
purple
dome
above
the
desert
city
their
light
gave
a
faint
misty
white
tinge
to
the
scented
blueness
of
the
harem
garden
there
trees
sighed
softly
moving
vague
and
as
a
warm
breeze
stirred
them
the
walled
pleasance
was
filled
with
the
scent
of
flowers
of
roses
magnolia
heliotrope
mimosa
and
a
hundred
other
blossoms
for
night
lay
heavy
upon
the
garden
in
sunken
ponds
the
stars
were
mirrored
rocking
gently
on
the
surface
of
the
ruffled
water
close
by
one
of
the
silvered
pools
a
figure
showed
big
and
white
in
flowing
garments
against
him
a
slender
girl
leant
rayma
eyes
rivalled
the
stars
as
she
gazed
up
at
her
sultan
and
owner
yet
in
their
dark
depths
a
touch
of
anxiety
lurked
a
fortnight
ago
the
sultan
had
returned
to
the
first
week
had
been
one
of
blissful
happiness
for
the
arab
girl
for
her
master
had
returned
more
her
lover
than
ever
but
as
the
days
went
on
doubts
crept
into
her
heart
vague
and
haunting
at
times
it
seemed
to
her
he
was
not
quite
the
same
man
who
left
her
for
paris
for
he
had
a
habit
now
that
he
had
not
had
before
he
went
away
a
disconcerting
habit
of
looking
at
her
with
unseeing
eyes
as
if
his
thoughts
were
elsewhere
this
mood
was
on
him
now
although
the
night
called
for
nothing
but
love
and
caresses
none
had
fallen
to
her
lot
although
she
rested
against
him
she
might
not
have
been
there
for
all
the
notice
he
took
he
appeared
to
have
forgotten
her
as
he
gazed
in
a
brooding
longing
manner
at
the
soft
velvety
depths
of
the
purple
sky
sky
as
deeply
softly
purple
as
pansies
rayma
pressed
closer
to
her
lord
and
sultan
looking
at
him
with
anxious
eyes
beloved
she
whispered
softly
are
your
thoughts
with
some
woman
in
paris
with
a
start
his
attention
came
back
to
her
in
the
starlight
he
scanned
her
little
face
in
a
fierce
hungry
disappointed
manner
for
the
slight
golden
girl
who
now
rested
upon
his
heart
brought
him
none
of
the
contentment
he
had
known
when
pansy
had
been
there
no
little
one
he
said
gently
i
prefer
you
to
all
the
women
i
met
in
paris
her
slim
arms
went
round
his
neck
in
a
clinging
passionate
embrace
oh
my
lord
she
whispered
such
words
are
my
life
at
times
i
think
you
do
not
love
me
as
you
once
did
you
seem
not
quite
the
same
for
often
although
your
arms
are
around
me
you
forget
that
i
am
there
a
bitter
expression
crossed
his
face
he
did
not
forget
that
she
was
there
although
he
had
come
back
to
the
desert
girl
he
had
once
loved
it
was
not
her
he
wanted
but
the
girl
who
had
scorned
and
flouted
him
his
enemy
daughter
and
he
tried
to
forget
her
in
the
slim
golden
arms
that
held
him
with
such
desire
and
passion
no
rayma
i
not
quite
the
same
he
said
stroking
the
little
face
that
watched
him
with
such
love
and
longing
for
sixteen
years
and
more
i
have
waited
to
avenge
my
father
death
and
now
he
broke
off
and
laughed
savagely
and
now
my
father
murderer
is
almost
within
my
grip
next
week
i
start
out
with
my
men
to
capture
him
revenge
was
a
sentiment
the
arab
girl
could
understand
oh
my
lord
she
whispered
little
wonder
that
your
mind
wanders
from
me
even
though
i
am
within
your
arms
i
wept
when
you
went
to
paris
but
i
would
speed
you
on
this
quest
for
vengeance
the
sultan
made
no
reply
deep
down
in
his
own
heart
he
knew
his
excuse
was
a
false
one
it
was
not
vengeance
that
came
between
him
and
rayma
but
pansy
and
now
he
hated
the
english
girl
for
she
had
robbed
all
other
women
of
their
sweetness
chapter
ii
over
the
old
fort
near
the
river
the
british
flag
drooped
limply
many
years
had
passed
since
it
had
last
hung
there
nowadays
the
place
was
not
used
the
country
was
too
peaceful
to
need
forts
and
the
district
officer
lived
in
a
corrugated
iron
bungalow
just
beyond
the
remains
of
the
stockade
it
was
getting
on
towards
evening
the
mist
still
rose
from
forest
and
shadow
valley
as
it
had
risen
sixteen
years
before
when
barclay
first
came
to
these
parts
and
in
the
stunted
cliffs
another
generation
of
baboons
swarmed
on
the
roof
of
the
old
fort
pansy
stood
with
her
father
watching
as
she
had
often
watched
during
her
months
in
africa
the
sunset
that
each
night
painted
the
world
with
glory
a
golden
mist
draped
the
horizon
its
edge
gilded
sharply
and
clearly
across
the
golden
curtain
swept
great
rays
of
rose
and
green
and
glowing
carmine
all
radiating
from
a
blurred
mass
of
orange
hung
on
the
world
edge
where
the
sun
sank
slowly
behind
the
veil
of
gold
the
mist
rolled
up
from
the
wide
shallow
valley
in
banks
and
tattered
ribbons
rainbow
tinted
and
the
lakes
that
in
the
dry
season
marked
the
course
of
the
shrunken
river
gleamed
like
jewels
in
the
flood
of
light
poured
out
from
the
heavens
the
constant
change
and
variety
of
the
last
few
months
had
eased
pansy
pain
a
little
with
her
father
she
had
toured
the
colony
she
had
slept
under
canvas
in
native
huts
and
iron
bungalows
and
there
were
officers
on
the
governor
staff
all
anxious
to
entertain
his
daughter
but
for
the
nights
pansy
would
have
enjoyed
herself
immensely
give
me
the
nights
pansy
and
the
days
i
leave
to
you
very
often
raoul
le
breton
words
came
back
to
her
as
she
lay
sleepless
it
seemed
that
he
had
her
nights
now
that
man
she
loved
yet
could
not
marry
often
her
heart
ached
with
a
violence
that
kept
her
awake
until
the
morning
pansy
tried
to
make
her
nights
as
short
as
possible
she
was
always
the
last
to
bed
and
the
first
to
rise
often
up
and
dressed
before
alice
her
plump
pretty
mulatto
maid
a
mission
girl
pansy
had
engaged
for
her
stay
in
africa
appeared
with
the
early
morning
tea
and
whenever
it
was
possible
she
was
out
and
away
on
her
old
racehorse
with
some
member
of
her
father
staff
and
the
day
that
followed
was
generally
full
of
novelty
and
interest
there
were
new
people
to
see
a
wild
country
to
travel
through
some
negro
chief
to
interview
a
native
village
to
visit
as
the
journey
continued
the
europeans
grew
fewer
until
that
day
it
was
nearly
a
week
since
pansy
had
seen
a
white
face
except
those
of
her
father
suite
only
that
afternoon
the
furthermost
point
of
the
tour
had
been
reached
a
mile
or
so
beyond
was
french
territory
with
her
father
pansy
often
went
over
the
maps
of
the
district
and
the
country
that
lay
around
it
she
knew
that
beyond
the
british
possessions
lay
a
sparsely
populated
and
but
little
known
district
vast
areas
scarcely
explored
of
scrub
and
poor
grass
that
led
on
to
the
back
of
beyond
the
limitless
expanse
of
the
burning
sahara
but
interested
as
pansy
always
was
in
all
connected
with
her
province
and
all
that
lay
about
it
she
was
not
thinking
of
any
of
these
things
as
she
stood
on
the
roof
with
him
but
of
her
old
playmate
captain
cameron
the
governor
his
staff
and
the
district
officer
were
going
the
next
day
to
visit
some
rather
important
negro
chief
pansy
was
to
have
been
one
of
the
party
but
on
reaching
their
journey
end
cameron
had
suddenly
developed
a
bad
attack
of
malaria
i
do
think
i
go
father
she
was
saying
i
like
leaving
bob
i
know
his
orderly
can
look
after
him
all
right
but
he
says
he
feels
better
when
i
about
so
i
promised
to
stay
and
hold
his
hand
just
as
you
like
sir
george
answered
in
any
case
the
will
be
very
similar
to
a
dozen
others
you
seen
and
bob
needs
keeping
cheerful
he
takes
it
very
philosophically
pansy
answered
it
the
only
way
to
take
life
her
father
answered
a
trifle
sadly
pansy
rubbed
a
soft
cheek
against
his
in
silent
sympathy
she
loved
and
understood
her
quiet
indulgent
father
more
than
ever
but
the
dead
girl
he
still
grieved
for
was
only
a
misty
memory
to
his
child
yes
daddy
i
learnt
that
too
she
said
it
no
use
grousing
about
things
it
far
better
to
laugh
in
the
teeth
of
fate
george
barclay
arm
went
round
his
daughter
she
had
followed
out
her
own
precepts
this
brave
bright
girl
of
his
as
she
went
about
his
camp
no
one
would
have
guessed
her
life
was
a
tragedy
and
even
he
knew
no
more
than
she
had
told
him
on
her
unexpected
return
from
grand
canary
she
was
fighting
her
battle
alone
as
he
in
past
years
had
fought
his
in
her
own
unselfish
way
refusing
to
let
her
shadows
fall
on
those
about
her
chapter
iii
about
five
miles
away
from
the
old
fort
deep
in
the
forest
there
was
a
large
grassy
glade
an
unfrequented
spot
within
it
now
were
encamped
what
looked
to
be
a
large
party
of
arab
merchants
there
were
about
a
hundred
of
them
and
they
had
come
early
that
morning
with
horses
and
camels
and
mules
and
bales
of
merchandise
and
they
outnumbered
barclay
party
by
nearly
three
to
one
his
following
were
not
more
than
forty
including
thirty
hausa
soldiers
immediately
on
arriving
in
the
glade
two
of
the
arabs
with
curios
had
been
dispatched
to
the
english
camp
outwardly
to
sell
their
goods
but
in
reality
as
spies
they
had
hardly
gone
before
the
rest
of
the
party
put
aside
its
peaceful
air
out
of
their
bales
weapons
were
produced
guns
of
the
latest
pattern
and
knives
in
his
tent
the
sultan
casim
ammeh
sat
in
white
burnoose
awaiting
the
return
of
his
spies
with
him
was
edouard
his
french
doctor
who
was
watching
his
royal
master
with
an
air
of
concern
i
shall
be
glad
when
this
thing
is
through
and
done
with
he
remarked
presently
his
voice
heavy
with
anxiety
and
all
i
hope
is
that
the
english
do
get
hold
of
you
there
be
short
shrift
for
you
if
you
caught
meddling
with
their
officials
they
shoot
me
as
barclay
shot
my
father
the
sultan
replied
grimly
but
i
willing
to
risk
that
in
order
to
get
hold
of
him
i
wish
we
were
safely
back
in
the
doctor
said
you
never
experienced
either
a
deep
love
or
a
deep
hate
edouard
the
surface
of
things
has
always
satisfied
you
you
to
be
envied
well
i
hope
that
love
will
never
run
you
into
the
dangers
that
this
revenge
of
yours
is
likely
to
edouard
replied
getting
up
he
went
from
the
tent
leaving
the
sultan
alone
awaiting
the
return
of
his
spies
it
was
nearly
midday
when
they
got
back
to
the
glade
at
once
they
were
taken
into
the
royal
presence
what
have
you
learnt
the
sultan
demanded
the
arabs
bowed
low
before
their
ruler
your
highness
the
english
party
has
broken
up
one
replied
the
chief
and
his
officers
with
half
the
soldiers
have
gone
to
a
village
that
lies
about
half
way
between
here
and
the
fort
and
the
white
lady
his
daughter
is
left
behind
with
but
fifteen
men
to
guard
her
as
le
breton
listened
the
task
he
had
set
himself
appeared
even
easier
than
he
had
imagined
at
the
head
of
his
men
he
would
waylay
and
capture
the
governor
and
his
party
on
their
return
from
the
village
when
this
was
accomplished
he
would
send
off
a
contingent
to
seize
pansy
with
this
idea
in
view
he
summoned
a
couple
of
native
officers
into
his
presence
when
they
appeared
he
gave
them
various
instructions
about
the
matter
on
hand
and
finally
his
plans
concerning
pansy
no
shot
must
be
fired
in
the
presence
of
the
english
lady
he
finished
at
all
costs
she
must
be
captured
without
injury
with
deference
the
arab
officers
listened
to
his
instructions
then
they
bowed
and
left
the
royal
presence
not
long
afterwards
the
glade
was
practically
empty
save
for
the
tents
and
camels
and
mules
at
the
head
of
his
men
the
sultan
casim
ammeh
had
gone
in
quest
of
the
vengeance
he
had
waited
quite
sixteen
years
for
chapter
iv
in
the
of
the
old
fort
where
george
barclay
had
once
housed
his
wounded
arab
prisoners
captain
cameron
sat
propped
up
with
pillows
in
a
camp
bed
it
was
a
cool
dim
room
with
thick
stone
walls
tiny
windows
high
up
near
the
ceiling
and
a
strong
wooden
door
that
was
barred
from
the
inside
beside
him
pansy
sat
pouring
out
the
tea
that
his
orderly
had
just
brought
in
and
trying
to
coax
an
appetite
that
malaria
had
left
capricious
cameron
fever
had
burnt
itself
out
in
hours
as
such
fevers
will
but
it
had
left
the
young
man
very
weak
and
washed
out
scarcely
able
to
stand
on
his
legs
as
pansy
sat
talking
and
coaxing
trying
to
make
a
sick
man
forget
his
sickness
into
the
stillness
of
the
drowsy
afternoon
there
came
a
sound
that
neither
of
them
expected
the
thunder
of
horses
hoofs
like
a
regiment
sweeping
towards
them
as
far
as
cameron
knew
there
were
no
horses
in
the
district
except
their
own
and
they
numbered
only
about
half
a
dozen
not
enough
to
produce
anything
like
that
amount
of
sound
what
on
earth
can
that
be
he
asked
suddenly
alert
almost
as
he
spoke
there
was
a
further
sound
a
sound
of
firing
not
a
single
shot
but
a
volley
it
was
followed
immediately
by
cries
and
screams
and
a
hubbub
of
native
voices
cameron
had
seen
active
service
that
sound
made
him
forget
all
about
his
fever
he
knew
it
for
a
surprise
attack
but
who
had
attacked
them
and
why
he
could
not
imagine
for
the
district
was
peaceful
barefooted
and
in
pyjamas
he
scrambled
out
of
bed
swaying
he
fumbled
under
his
pillow
and
producing
a
revolver
slipped
it
into
his
pocket
then
he
staggered
across
to
the
door
pansy
at
his
heels
when
they
looked
out
it
appeared
that
the
stockade
was
filled
with
figures
on
horseback
lean
brown
men
whom
pansy
immediately
recognised
for
arabs
the
surprised
hausa
soldiers
had
been
driven
into
one
corner
of
the
compound
and
back
to
back
were
fighting
valiantly
against
overwhelming
odds
cameron
did
not
wait
to
see
any
more
already
a
score
or
more
of
the
wild
horsemen
were
sweeping
on
towards
the
old
fort
where
the
two
stood
quick
as
thought
he
shut
the
guardroom
door
with
hands
that
shook
with
fever
he
stooped
and
picked
up
one
of
the
two
iron
bars
that
held
it
in
position
lend
me
a
hand
pansy
he
said
sharply
but
pansy
did
not
need
any
telling
already
she
had
seized
the
other
end
of
the
heavy
bar
it
was
in
position
just
as
the
horde
outside
reached
the
there
was
a
rattle
of
arms
the
sound
of
horses
being
brought
sharply
to
a
halt
then
orders
shouted
in
a
wild
barbaric
language
there
followed
a
shower
of
heavy
blows
upon
the
door
when
the
second
iron
bar
was
in
position
the
boy
and
the
girl
stood
for
a
moment
and
looked
at
one
another
pansy
was
the
first
to
speak
what
has
happened
she
asked
it
looks
like
a
desert
tribe
out
on
some
marauding
expedition
he
replied
in
as
cool
a
voice
as
he
could
muster
but
i
sure
i
know
what
they
doing
down
as
far
as
here
my
father
pansy
said
quickly
cameron
made
no
reply
he
hoped
the
governor
party
had
not
fallen
foul
of
the
marauders
but
the
fate
of
sir
george
and
his
staff
was
not
the
one
that
troubled
him
now
all
his
thoughts
were
for
the
girl
he
loved
to
keep
her
from
falling
into
the
hands
of
that
barbaric
horde
and
fall
she
must
dead
or
alive
before
so
very
long
strong
as
the
door
was
it
would
not
be
able
to
withstand
the
assaults
the
arabs
could
put
upon
it
with
a
casual
air
cameron
examined
his
revolver
to
make
sure
that
the
five
cartridges
were
complete
then
he
glanced
at
the
girl
she
caught
his
eye
and
smiled
bravely
she
had
grasped
the
situation
also
we
all
have
to
die
sooner
or
later
she
remarked
i
hope
it
be
sooner
in
my
case
cameron
young
face
grew
even
whiter
and
more
drawn
this
time
with
something
more
than
fever
the
thought
of
the
task
before
him
four
shots
for
them
pansy
and
the
fifth
for
you
he
answered
hoarsely
yes
bob
whatever
you
do
do
forget
the
fifth
as
they
talked
thundering
blows
were
falling
on
the
door
filling
the
room
with
constantly
recurring
echoes
but
the
wood
and
iron
withstood
the
assault
the
noise
stopped
suddenly
from
outside
voices
could
be
heard
evidently
discussing
what
had
better
be
done
next
pansy
and
cameron
crossed
to
the
far
side
of
the
room
and
stood
there
side
by
side
their
backs
against
the
wall
waiting
when
the
blows
came
again
they
were
different
one
heavy
ponderous
thud
that
made
the
door
creak
and
groan
with
a
pause
between
each
blow
they
got
a
to
work
now
a
tree
trunk
or
something
cameron
remarked
that
good
old
door
wo
be
able
to
stand
the
strain
much
longer
then
he
glanced
at
the
girl
longing
in
his
eyes
let
me
give
you
one
kiss
pansy
a
kiss
he
whispered
it
years
since
i
kissed
you
you
such
a
one
for
keeping
a
fellow
at
arm
length
nowadays
with
death
knocking
at
the
door
pansy
could
not
refuse
him
this
nice
boy
she
had
always
liked
yet
never
loved
she
thought
of
the
man
who
had
feasted
so
freely
on
her
lips
that
night
in
the
moonlit
garden
in
grand
canary
she
wanted
no
man
kisses
but
his
no
man
love
but
his
and
his
race
and
colour
barred
him
out
from
her
for
ever
kiss
me
if
you
like
bob
for
old
time
sake
but
she
broke
off
listening
to
the
noises
from
outside
the
heavy
regular
thud
on
the
door
that
had
now
set
the
stone
walls
trembling
now
i
shall
die
a
young
maid
instead
of
an
old
one
that
all
she
said
suddenly
cameron
watched
her
pain
on
his
face
this
girl
who
could
face
death
with
a
courage
that
equalled
his
own
then
he
kissed
her
tenderly
pansy
little
pal
he
said
hoarsely
afterwards
there
was
silence
in
the
room
between
the
heavy
blows
flies
droned
droned
as
if
all
were
well
with
the
world
as
if
nothing
untoward
were
happening
pansy
listened
to
them
a
strained
look
on
her
face
so
they
would
go
on
droning
after
she
was
dead
how
painful
the
thought
would
once
have
been
but
the
world
had
grown
so
tragic
since
she
had
met
and
parted
with
raoul
le
breton
life
had
become
so
dreary
there
was
a
constant
gnawing
pain
at
her
heart
now
a
pain
that
pansy
hoped
would
not
follow
her
from
this
world
into
another
there
was
a
crash
of
falling
timber
the
door
gave
way
suddenly
letting
in
a
flood
of
wild
men
if
cameron
thought
of
anything
beyond
getting
his
four
shots
home
among
the
swarming
crowd
it
was
to
wonder
why
they
did
not
fire
instead
of
rushing
towards
him
and
the
girl
but
he
did
not
give
much
time
to
the
problem
within
four
seconds
four
shots
had
been
fired
at
the
onrushing
arabs
and
with
ruthless
joy
cameron
noted
that
four
of
them
fell
then
he
turned
his
weapon
on
the
girl
beside
him
now
that
her
turn
had
come
pansy
smiled
at
him
bravely
with
white
lips
but
as
cameron
turned
a
shot
grazed
his
hand
fired
by
the
leader
of
the
arabs
who
appeared
to
have
grasped
what
the
englishman
was
about
to
do
the
bullet
did
not
reach
pansy
brain
as
cameron
intended
for
the
pain
of
his
wound
sent
his
hand
slightly
downwards
just
as
he
pulled
the
trigger
his
bullet
found
a
in
her
heart
it
seemed
with
a
faint
gasp
she
fell
as
if
dead
at
his
feet
a
red
stain
on
the
front
of
her
white
dress
this
contretemps
left
the
onrushing
horde
aghast
they
halted
abruptly
in
silence
they
stood
staring
at
the
limp
form
of
the
prostrate
girl
the
fear
of
death
upon
their
swarthy
faces
chapter
v
in
his
tent
the
sultan
casim
ammeh
was
waiting
for
the
return
of
the
party
sent
on
to
the
old
fort
to
capture
pansy
so
far
there
had
been
no
hitch
in
his
schemes
sir
george
and
his
staff
had
proved
an
easy
prey
already
one
portion
of
his
arab
following
with
barclay
officers
had
set
out
on
the
long
journey
back
to
sir
george
and
pansy
the
sultan
had
arranged
to
take
up
himself
as
soon
as
the
girl
was
in
his
hands
for
he
had
no
desire
to
linger
in
british
territory
but
it
was
not
the
punishment
england
would
dole
out
to
him
if
he
were
caught
that
filled
le
breton
mind
as
he
sat
among
the
cushions
with
the
cruel
lines
about
his
mouth
very
much
in
evidence
his
thoughts
were
all
with
sir
george
barclay
daughter
what
desert
harem
would
be
her
future
home
what
wild
chief
would
call
that
girl
his
chattel
casim
ammeh
had
determined
to
carry
out
his
vengeance
to
the
letter
where
pansy
was
concerned
to
sell
her
in
the
of
his
capital
and
keep
her
father
alive
tortured
by
the
knowledge
of
his
daughter
fate
what
would
the
girl
say
when
she
saw
him
when
she
recognised
him
for
the
sultan
of
the
man
her
father
had
wronged
past
all
forgiveness
would
that
sweet
brave
face
go
white
at
the
knowledge
of
the
fate
before
her
would
she
try
to
plead
with
him
or
herself
and
her
father
would
le
breton
pulled
his
straying
thoughts
up
sharply
lest
they
should
go
wandering
down
forbidden
ways
ways
that
led
to
where
love
was
he
had
determined
to
hate
pansy
a
hatred
he
had
to
keep
continually
before
him
lest
he
should
forget
it
the
afternoon
wore
on
bringing
long
shadows
creeping
into
the
glade
and
the
sultan
sat
waiting
for
the
full
fruit
of
his
vengeance
there
might
be
peace
in
his
heart
once
the
wrong
done
to
his
father
was
righted
peace
in
the
restless
heart
that
throbbed
within
him
that
seemed
always
searching
for
a
life
other
than
the
one
he
lived
a
peace
he
had
known
just
once
or
twice
when
a
girl
slight
form
had
rested
upon
it
his
enemy
daughter
the
sound
of
approaching
hoofs
broke
into
his
thoughts
he
knew
what
they
were
those
of
the
party
sent
on
to
capture
pansy
when
the
cavalcade
halted
his
eyes
went
to
the
open
flap
of
the
big
tent
a
savage
expression
in
them
he
could
not
see
the
returned
party
from
there
only
the
guards
posted
outside
of
the
royal
quarters
presently
a
couple
of
men
in
flowing
white
robes
came
into
view
the
two
officers
who
had
headed
the
expedition
they
were
challenged
by
the
sentries
then
they
passed
on
towards
the
tent
where
their
sultan
was
waiting
there
was
concern
upon
their
faces
that
deepened
to
resignation
and
despair
when
the
royal
gaze
rested
upon
them
where
is
the
english
lady
their
sultan
demanded
coldly
your
highness
there
was
a
man
of
her
colour
with
her
and
one
of
the
officers
began
le
breton
made
an
impatient
gesture
bring
me
the
girl
he
commanded
the
officers
glanced
at
one
another
then
one
knelt
before
the
sultan
the
instructions
were
carried
out
he
said
but
the
english
lady
is
dead
there
was
a
moment
of
tense
silence
a
feeling
of
someone
fighting
against
an
incredible
truth
pansy
dead
impossible
the
sultan
sat
as
if
turned
into
stone
the
contretemps
was
one
he
had
never
anticipated
dead
the
echoes
whispered
at
him
mockingly
through
the
tent
dead
they
sighed
unto
themselves
as
if
in
dire
pain
and
that
one
tragic
word
stripped
love
of
its
garment
of
hate
and
set
it
before
him
alive
and
vital
the
tent
suddenly
became
charged
with
suffering
and
the
feeling
of
a
fierce
proud
heart
breaking
dead
the
sultan
repeated
in
a
hoarse
incredulous
voice
then
allah
have
pity
on
the
man
who
killed
her
for
i
shall
have
none
your
highness
there
was
a
white
man
with
her
he
shot
her
the
kneeling
officer
explained
le
breton
hardly
heard
him
for
the
first
time
in
his
wild
arrogant
life
he
felt
regret
regret
for
a
deed
of
his
own
doing
the
regret
that
is
the
forerunner
of
conscience
as
conscience
precedes
the
birth
of
a
soul
the
soul
he
had
once
laughingly
accused
pansy
of
trying
to
save
his
schemes
had
brought
her
to
her
death
morally
his
was
the
hand
that
had
killed
her
his
hand
the
thought
staggered
him
he
got
to
his
feet
suddenly
reeling
slightly
as
if
in
dire
agony
the
officer
kneeling
before
him
bowed
his
head
submissively
he
expected
the
fate
of
all
who
bring
bad
news
to
a
sultan
the
sword
upon
his
neck
but
le
breton
hardly
noticed
the
man
he
only
saw
his
own
deed
before
him
love
had
leapt
out
of
its
scabbard
of
hate
the
one
fact
he
had
tried
to
keep
hidden
from
himself
was
shouting
at
him
in
spite
of
who
and
what
pansy
was
he
still
loved
her
madly
ragingly
hopelessly
but
it
had
taken
her
death
to
bring
the
truth
home
to
him
where
is
the
girl
he
asked
in
a
stiff
harsh
voice
we
brought
her
so
that
your
highness
could
see
we
spoke
the
truth
the
officer
replied
let
her
be
brought
in
to
me
then
and
laid
there
the
sultan
said
indicating
a
wide
couch
full
of
cushions
glad
to
escape
with
their
lives
the
officers
hurried
out
to
do
the
royal
bidding
there
were
no
cruel
lines
about
the
sultan
mouth
as
he
waited
their
return
but
deep
gashes
of
pain
instead
a
silent
cavalcade
entered
the
tent
some
minutes
later
as
silent
as
the
sultan
who
stood
awaiting
them
as
silent
as
the
girl
with
the
red
stain
on
her
breast
and
the
red
blood
on
her
lips
a
look
from
the
sultan
dismissed
the
men
when
they
had
gone
he
crossed
to
pansy
side
and
stood
gazing
down
at
her
she
lay
limp
and
white
a
broken
lily
before
him
his
enemy
daughter
this
still
white
lovely
girl
this
pearl
among
women
whom
he
had
tried
to
hate
and
now
pain
twisted
his
face
he
thought
of
pansy
as
he
had
last
seen
her
that
night
on
her
yacht
she
had
wanted
to
bring
about
an
understanding
between
them
she
had
tried
to
see
things
from
his
point
of
view
she
was
prepared
to
make
allowances
to
find
excuses
for
him
and
he
had
treated
her
with
harshness
wilfully
set
her
at
a
disadvantage
purposely
had
misunderstood
her
deliberately
had
said
all
he
could
to
wound
her
he
had
done
his
best
to
hate
her
he
had
put
vengeance
before
love
now
he
had
his
reward
his
wild
lust
for
revenge
had
stilled
that
kind
heart
that
had
lived
to
do
its
best
for
all
a
stifled
groan
came
to
his
lips
what
a
trick
fate
had
played
upon
him
leaning
over
the
couch
he
took
one
of
her
limp
white
hands
into
his
strong
brown
one
the
little
hand
whose
touch
could
always
soothe
his
restless
spirit
that
had
once
teased
and
caressed
him
opening
out
visions
of
a
paradise
that
his
own
deeds
had
now
shut
out
from
him
for
ever
the
fruit
of
the
tree
of
vengeance
is
bitter
and
this
le
breton
realized
to
the
fullest
as
he
gazed
at
the
silent
girl
pansy
do
mock
me
from
beyond
the
styx
he
whispered
for
you
know
now
that
my
heart
is
broken
there
nothing
but
grief
for
me
here
and
hereafter
then
it
seemed
to
the
tortured
man
that
a
miracle
happened
the
girl
eyes
opened
for
a
brief
second
she
gazed
at
him
in
a
dazed
bewildered
manner
then
her
lids
dropped
weakly
as
if
even
that
slight
effort
were
too
much
for
her
chapter
vi
night
surrounded
the
arab
encampment
here
and
there
a
red
punctuated
the
darkness
although
well
past
midnight
a
light
burnt
in
the
sultan
tent
it
came
from
a
heavy
silver
lamp
slung
from
the
bar
joining
the
two
main
supporting
poles
the
light
flickered
on
the
couch
where
pansy
still
lay
limp
and
white
among
the
silken
cushions
her
curls
making
a
halo
about
her
face
she
was
no
longer
clad
in
her
muslin
frock
but
in
a
silk
nightgown
with
her
namesakes
embroidered
upon
it
a
light
silk
rug
covered
her
up
to
her
waist
on
it
her
hands
lay
weak
and
helpless
on
discovering
there
was
a
spark
of
life
left
in
his
prisoner
the
sultan
had
sent
to
an
adjacent
tent
for
edouard
when
the
doctor
arrived
le
breton
stood
silent
whilst
the
patient
was
examined
in
an
agony
of
tortured
love
awaiting
the
verdict
there
no
hope
unless
i
can
get
the
bullet
out
the
doctor
had
remarked
at
the
end
of
the
examination
it
escaped
her
heart
by
about
half
an
inch
but
it
means
constant
haemorrhage
if
it
left
in
the
lungs
and
if
it
removed
the
sultan
asked
hoarsely
edouard
shrugged
his
shoulders
in
a
manner
it
be
touch
and
go
even
then
but
she
might
pull
through
with
care
and
attention
she
young
and
healthy
but
if
she
survives
she
feel
the
effects
of
that
bullet
for
some
time
to
come
with
that
edouard
left
to
fetch
his
instruments
leaving
the
sultan
gazing
down
at
the
result
of
his
own
mad
desire
for
vengeance
a
red
oozing
wound
on
a
girl
white
breast
when
the
doctor
returned
whilst
he
probed
after
the
bullet
le
breton
held
pansy
with
firm
careful
strength
lest
in
pain
she
should
move
and
send
the
instrument
into
the
heart
cameron
shot
had
just
missed
but
she
was
unconscious
through
it
all
although
the
probing
brought
a
further
gush
of
blood
edouard
managed
to
locate
the
bullet
and
extract
it
after
the
wound
was
dressed
and
pansy
bound
and
bandaged
up
the
doctor
left
with
his
departure
the
sultan
sent
for
pansy
belongings
which
his
soldiers
had
brought
up
as
plunder
from
the
raid
there
was
no
woman
among
his
following
so
he
sent
one
of
the
guards
to
inquire
if
there
was
one
among
the
captives
presently
pansy
mulatto
maid
was
brought
to
him
alice
was
a
pretty
brown
girl
of
about
seventeen
clad
in
a
blue
cotton
slip
and
she
wore
a
yellow
silk
handkerchief
tied
around
her
black
curls
with
awe
she
gazed
about
the
sumptuous
tent
with
admiration
at
her
handsome
kingly
captor
he
however
had
nothing
to
say
to
her
beyond
giving
her
instructions
to
serve
her
mistress
and
warning
her
to
use
the
utmost
care
when
alice
set
about
her
task
he
went
from
the
tent
to
interview
edouard
pansy
condition
had
upset
his
plans
even
if
the
girl
recovered
she
could
not
be
moved
for
a
week
at
least
no
matter
how
carefully
her
litter
was
carried
and
a
force
as
large
as
his
could
not
stay
a
week
in
the
neighbourhood
without
the
fact
becoming
known
when
le
breton
returned
he
dismissed
alice
and
he
seated
himself
by
the
couch
and
stayed
there
watching
the
unconscious
girl
evening
shadows
crept
into
the
tent
bringing
a
silent
servant
who
lighted
the
heavy
silver
lamp
and
withdrew
as
silently
as
he
had
come
dinner
appeared
a
sumptuous
meal
that
the
sultan
waved
aside
impatiently
then
edouard
came
again
to
see
how
the
patient
was
faring
to
give
an
injection
and
go
after
a
curious
glance
at
the
big
impassive
figure
of
his
patron
sitting
silent
and
brooding
at
his
captive
side
gradually
the
noises
of
the
camp
died
down
until
outside
there
was
only
the
sough
of
the
forest
the
whisper
of
the
wind
in
the
the
occasional
stamp
of
a
horse
hoof
the
hoot
of
an
owl
in
the
glade
and
every
now
and
again
in
the
distance
the
mocking
laugh
of
hyenas
mocking
at
him
it
seemed
to
le
breton
at
a
man
whose
own
doings
had
brought
his
beloved
to
death
door
within
the
tent
there
was
no
longer
silence
faint
little
moans
whispered
through
it
occasionally
mingling
with
the
rustle
of
silken
curtains
and
the
sparking
of
the
lamp
and
every
now
and
again
there
were
weak
bouts
of
coughing
coughs
that
brought
an
ominous
red
stain
to
pansy
lips
stains
the
sultan
dabbed
off
carefully
with
a
handkerchief
his
strong
hand
shaking
slightly
his
arrogant
face
working
strangely
for
he
knew
he
was
responsible
for
the
upon
her
lips
every
hour
edouard
came
to
give
the
injection
which
held
the
soul
back
from
the
grim
bony
hands
of
death
that
groped
after
it
once
or
twice
pansy
eyes
opened
but
they
closed
almost
instantly
as
if
she
had
not
strength
enough
to
hold
them
open
but
before
daybreak
her
coughs
had
ceased
an
hour
passed
then
two
without
that
ominous
red
stain
coming
to
her
lips
edouard
nodded
to
himself
in
a
satisfied
way
as
he
left
the
tent
a
little
of
the
strained
look
left
the
sultan
face
the
haemorrhage
had
stopped
youth
and
health
were
winning
the
battle
just
as
the
first
pink
streak
of
dawn
entered
the
tent
pansy
eyes
opened
again
and
stayed
open
purple
wells
of
pain
that
rested
on
the
sultan
with
a
puzzled
expression
into
the
misty
world
of
suffering
and
weakness
in
which
she
moved
it
seemed
to
her
that
raoul
le
breton
had
come
looking
at
her
as
he
had
once
looked
with
love
and
tenderness
in
his
glowing
eyes
she
could
not
make
out
where
she
was
or
how
he
came
to
be
there
she
had
no
recollection
of
the
horde
who
had
broken
into
the
guardroom
where
she
and
cameron
had
been
she
was
too
full
of
suffering
to
give
any
thought
to
the
problem
raoul
le
breton
was
with
her
that
was
enough
a
wan
smile
of
recognition
trembled
for
a
moment
on
her
lips
raoul
she
said
faintly
it
was
more
a
sigh
than
a
word
but
his
name
whispered
so
feebly
brought
him
kneeling
beside
her
couch
bending
over
her
eagerly
my
darling
forgive
me
he
whispered
passionately
he
bent
his
head
still
lower
with
infinite
tenderness
kissing
the
white
lips
that
had
breathed
his
name
so
faintly
pansy
eyes
closed
again
a
look
of
contentment
came
to
mingle
with
the
suffering
on
her
face
outside
the
hyenas
still
laughed
mockingly
derisive
echoes
from
a
distance
but
le
breton
did
not
hear
them
despite
his
treatment
of
her
pansy
had
smiled
upon
him
for
the
first
time
in
his
wild
life
he
felt
humility
and
gratitude
both
new
sensations
when
edouard
came
again
he
pronounced
the
girl
sleeping
not
unconscious
with
care
and
attention
she
pull
through
he
said
thank
god
his
patron
exclaimed
with
unfeigned
relief
and
joy
edouard
glanced
at
his
master
speculatively
he
had
heard
nothing
about
pansy
existence
until
he
had
been
hurriedly
summoned
to
attend
her
and
he
wondered
why
his
friend
and
patron
had
made
no
mention
of
the
girl
you
never
told
me
barclay
had
a
daughter
he
commented
i
did
not
know
myself
until
quite
recently
the
sultan
replied
is
she
to
share
her
father
fate
the
doctor
asked
drily
tenderly
the
sultan
gazed
at
the
small
white
face
on
the
cushions
she
not
my
enemy
he
said
in
a
caressing
tone
with
a
feeling
of
relief
edouard
left
the
tent
it
was
most
evident
that
the
sultan
had
fallen
in
love
with
his
beautiful
captive
if
the
girl
played
her
cards
well
she
would
be
able
to
save
her
father
and
prevent
his
patron
doling
out
death
to
a
british
official
thus
embroiling
himself
still
further
with
the
english
government
after
the
doctor
had
left
le
breton
sat
on
pansy
couch
yet
he
had
not
learnt
his
lesson
although
he
loved
the
daughter
he
hated
the
father
as
intensely
as
ever
now
he
was
making
other
plans
plans
that
would
enable
him
to
keep
both
love
and
vengeance
plans
too
that
might
make
the
girl
forget
his
colour
and
give
him
the
love
he
now
craved
for
so
wildly
chapter
vii
in
one
of
the
tents
in
the
glade
sir
george
barclay
sat
an
arab
guard
on
either
side
of
him
there
was
an
almost
stupefied
air
about
him
of
a
man
whose
world
has
suddenly
got
beyond
his
control
the
previous
afternoon
without
any
warning
his
party
had
been
set
upon
and
captured
but
by
whom
and
why
he
did
not
know
there
was
no
rebellious
chief
in
the
district
no
discontent
yet
he
was
a
prisoner
in
the
hands
of
some
wild
tribe
captured
so
suddenly
that
not
one
of
his
men
had
escaped
to
take
word
to
the
next
british
outpost
and
bring
up
a
force
to
his
assistance
there
was
but
one
streak
of
consolation
in
his
broodings
the
knowledge
that
his
daughter
had
not
fallen
alive
into
the
hands
of
the
barbaric
soldiery
some
little
time
after
he
had
been
brought
a
prisoner
to
the
glade
he
had
seen
cameron
come
in
white
and
shaking
with
fever
on
seeing
his
chief
the
young
man
had
shouted
across
the
space
thank
god
the
niggers
have
got
pansy
alive
they
were
given
no
time
for
further
conversation
for
one
was
hustled
this
way
and
one
that
as
barclay
sat
brooding
on
the
fate
that
had
overtaken
his
party
and
trying
to
find
a
reason
for
it
someone
entered
the
tent
in
the
newcomer
he
recognised
the
leader
of
the
force
that
had
waylaid
and
captured
him
and
his
party
so
george
barclay
we
meet
for
a
second
time
a
deep
voice
said
savagely
in
french
barclay
scanned
the
big
man
in
the
white
burnoose
who
stood
looking
at
him
with
hatred
in
his
dark
fiery
eyes
to
his
knowledge
he
had
never
seen
him
before
where
did
we
first
meet
he
asked
quietly
sixteen
years
ago
when
you
murdered
my
father
the
sultan
casim
ammeh
sir
george
started
violently
and
scanned
the
man
anew
he
had
a
reason
now
for
the
untoward
happenings
do
you
remember
all
i
promised
for
you
and
yours
that
day
you
refused
to
listen
to
my
pleadings
the
savage
voice
asked
barclay
remembered
only
too
well
and
as
he
looked
at
the
ruthless
face
before
him
he
was
more
than
ever
thankful
for
one
thing
thank
god
my
daughter
is
dead
he
said
the
sultan
smiled
coldly
cruelly
your
daughter
is
not
dead
he
replied
she
is
alive
just
alive
and
you
may
rest
assured
that
she
have
every
care
and
attention
the
news
left
barclay
staring
in
a
stricken
manner
at
his
captor
my
doctor
assures
me
that
she
will
live
the
sultan
went
on
and
you
will
live
too
to
see
her
sold
as
a
slave
in
the
public
market
of
my
city
sir
george
said
nothing
the
thought
of
pansy
ghastly
fate
placed
him
beyond
speech
at
that
moment
he
could
only
pray
that
she
might
die
chapter
viii
three
days
elapsed
before
pansy
returned
to
full
consciousness
and
even
then
the
world
was
a
very
hazy
place
one
morning
she
woke
up
almost
too
weak
to
move
with
a
feeling
that
she
must
have
had
a
bad
attack
of
fever
she
tried
to
sit
up
but
alice
her
mulatto
maid
bent
over
her
quickly
pressing
her
back
gently
on
the
pillows
no
missy
pansy
that
familiar
crooning
voice
said
with
an
air
of
authority
de
doctor
say
you
stay
dere
and
no
move
pansy
was
not
at
all
anxious
to
move
after
that
one
attempt
the
effort
had
brought
pains
cutting
through
her
chest
and
she
had
had
to
bite
her
lip
to
keep
herself
from
crying
out
in
agony
all
day
she
lay
in
silence
sleeping
most
of
the
time
when
awake
thankful
just
to
lie
still
for
even
to
talk
hurt
her
grateful
when
alice
fed
her
because
she
would
rather
have
gone
hungry
than
have
faced
the
pain
that
sitting
up
entailed
sometimes
from
outside
came
the
rattle
of
harness
the
stamp
of
a
hoof
men
voices
talking
in
a
strange
language
but
pansy
was
used
to
such
sounds
now
and
thought
nothing
of
them
they
had
been
around
her
all
the
time
she
had
been
on
tour
with
her
father
the
next
day
the
mist
had
cleared
considerably
pansy
realised
she
was
in
a
big
tent
not
an
affair
of
plain
green
canvas
such
as
she
had
lived
in
quite
a
lot
during
her
expedition
into
the
wilds
but
a
place
of
barbaric
splendour
silk
hangings
draped
the
canvas
walls
rich
curtains
heavily
embroidered
with
gold
the
very
poles
that
held
the
structure
up
were
of
silver
and
a
heavy
silver
lamp
was
suspended
from
the
central
bar
priceless
rugs
covered
the
ground
and
here
and
there
were
piles
of
soft
silk
cushions
there
were
one
or
two
little
ebony
tables
and
stools
inlaid
with
silver
and
ivory
her
bed
was
a
low
couch
of
soft
silk
and
down
cushions
and
on
the
floor
beside
her
was
a
beaten
gold
tray
where
jewelled
cups
reposed
and
dishes
with
coloured
sherbets
and
other
tempting
dainties
pansy
gaze
stayed
on
alice
in
a
puzzling
manner
alice
looked
much
the
same
as
plump
and
pretty
as
ever
but
with
an
even
more
pleased
with
herself
expression
than
usual
upon
her
round
smiling
face
from
her
maid
pansy
glanced
towards
the
entrance
of
the
tent
the
flap
was
fastened
back
letting
in
a
flood
of
fresh
morning
air
just
outside
two
men
were
stationed
and
beyond
were
others
and
a
glimpse
of
trees
pansy
eyes
stayed
on
the
arabs
guarding
her
quarters
in
a
vague
way
they
were
familiar
with
a
rush
came
back
the
happenings
of
the
afternoon
when
she
had
been
having
tea
with
cameron
in
the
old
guardroom
men
such
as
those
outside
had
burst
in
upon
them
when
the
brave
old
door
had
given
way
a
wave
of
sickly
fear
swept
over
the
girl
was
she
a
prisoner
in
the
hands
of
that
wild
horde
but
if
so
what
was
she
doing
in
the
midst
of
all
this
splendour
this
riot
of
luxury
with
the
softest
of
cushions
to
lie
on
the
choicest
of
silk
rugs
to
cover
her
and
alice
sitting
contentedly
at
her
side
perhaps
bob
could
give
her
the
key
to
the
situation
alice
she
said
weakly
run
and
tell
captain
cameron
i
want
to
speak
to
him
he
no
be
here
miss
pansy
the
girl
replied
he
go
to
de
sultan
casim
ammeh
city
alice
pronounced
the
sultan
name
with
gusto
the
desert
ruler
with
his
barbaric
splendour
and
troop
of
wild
horsemen
had
impressed
her
far
more
than
the
english
governor
and
his
retinue
she
did
not
at
all
mind
being
his
prisoner
moreover
she
was
a
privileged
person
told
off
specially
by
the
sultan
to
nurse
her
mistress
for
some
moments
pansy
pondered
on
what
her
maid
had
said
the
sultan
casim
ammeh
pansy
repeated
presently
with
an
air
of
bewilderment
dat
be
him
alice
assured
her
a
great
big
fine
man
awful
i
see
him
an
my
heart
go
all
soft
he
so
rich
and
proud
and
grand
but
he
no
look
at
me
only
at
you
miss
pansy
she
finished
sighing
pansy
hardly
heard
this
rhapsody
over
her
captor
his
name
was
familiar
but
half
forgotten
like
the
fairy
tales
of
her
childhood
then
she
suddenly
remembered
who
and
what
he
was
the
youthful
sultan
who
long
years
ago
had
sworn
to
kill
her
father
and
sell
her
as
a
slave
the
man
alice
mentioned
must
be
the
boy
grown
up
it
must
have
been
his
hordes
who
had
swept
down
on
her
and
bob
that
afternoon
but
it
was
not
of
herself
that
pansy
thought
when
the
truth
dawned
on
her
with
vivid
sickening
force
in
anxiety
for
her
father
she
forgot
the
fate
promised
for
herself
my
father
what
has
happened
to
him
she
asked
in
quick
alarm
de
sultan
he
catch
sir
george
too
alice
answered
coolly
pansy
heart
stood
still
is
he
still
alive
she
asked
breathlessly
horror
clutching
at
her
sir
george
he
go
also
to
the
city
of
de
sultan
city
a
feeling
of
overwhelming
relief
swept
over
pansy
on
hearing
her
father
was
still
alive
for
some
minutes
she
lay
brooding
on
the
horrible
situation
and
how
she
could
best
cope
with
it
all
the
time
feeling
as
if
she
were
in
some
wild
nightmare
then
she
remembered
her
own
vast
riches
all
these
arab
chiefs
knew
the
value
of
money
she
might
be
able
to
ransom
her
father
herself
the
whole
party
where
is
the
sultan
tell
him
i
want
to
see
him
she
said
suddenly
in
a
weak
excited
way
he
no
be
here
he
go
back
to
you
go
too
miss
pansy
i
go
wid
you
when
doctor
edouard
say
you
be
fit
to
move
pansy
clutched
at
the
name
of
edouard
after
that
of
the
sultan
casim
ammeh
it
had
a
welcome
european
sound
where
is
doctor
edouard
can
i
speak
to
him
she
asked
quickly
she
hardly
noticed
the
pain
within
herself
now
torn
as
she
was
with
anxiety
for
her
father
and
friends
alice
rose
ready
to
oblige
i
go
fetch
him
she
said
leaving
the
tent
she
interviewed
one
of
the
guards
then
she
passed
on
beyond
pansy
view
she
reappeared
some
few
moments
later
accompanied
by
a
short
stoutish
man
with
a
pointed
black
beard
unmistakably
of
french
nationality
who
was
dressed
in
a
neat
white
drill
suit
and
a
sun
helmet
anxiously
pansy
watched
him
approach
with
no
room
in
her
mind
to
think
how
he
came
to
be
there
a
person
as
european
as
herself
in
this
savage
sultan
following
do
tell
me
what
has
happened
she
said
without
any
preliminaries
the
moment
he
halted
at
her
bedside
however
edouard
did
not
tell
pansy
much
more
than
she
had
already
culled
for
herself
but
she
learnt
that
the
whole
of
her
party
were
prisoners
in
the
hands
of
this
desert
chief
and
were
now
on
their
way
back
to
his
capital
but
ca
you
do
something
she
asked
in
despair
i
virtually
a
prisoner
like
yourself
edouard
replied
in
a
tone
he
was
not
a
prisoner
but
he
was
paid
a
good
price
for
his
services
and
his
silence
and
he
had
no
intention
of
playing
an
excellent
friend
and
patron
false
but
is
there
nothing
i
can
do
pansy
asked
aghast
at
her
own
utter
helplessness
edouard
smiled
remembering
the
sultan
concern
for
the
beautiful
captive
girl
yes
there
one
thing
he
replied
in
a
soothing
tone
do
worry
about
the
matter
just
at
present
but
when
you
get
to
use
all
your
personal
influence
with
the
sultan
in
the
meantime
you
can
rest
assured
that
no
harm
will
happen
to
sir
george
and
his
staff
afterwards
i
rather
fancy
everything
depends
on
you
with
this
pansy
had
to
be
content
chapter
ix
in
bathhurst
the
deputy
governor
awaited
news
of
sir
george
barclay
more
than
a
month
had
passed
since
he
had
left
the
town
and
during
most
of
the
time
letters
had
come
through
regularly
to
official
headquarters
the
deputy
knew
that
the
furthermost
point
of
the
tour
must
now
be
about
reached
but
nearly
a
week
had
passed
without
any
communication
official
or
otherwise
coming
from
the
party
the
fact
was
not
alarming
the
part
sir
george
must
now
be
in
was
the
wildest
in
the
colony
and
a
week
might
easily
pass
without
any
message
coming
through
but
when
another
day
or
so
passed
without
bringing
any
news
the
deputy
began
to
wonder
what
had
happened
the
letters
must
have
gone
astray
one
of
the
officers
remarked
or
some
leopard
has
gobbled
up
the
postman
another
suggested
for
a
couple
of
days
longer
the
deputy
and
military
officers
waited
hourly
expecting
some
message
from
the
governor
party
but
none
came
there
was
no
reason
to
think
that
harm
had
befallen
them
for
the
colony
was
in
perfect
order
then
they
sent
up
for
news
to
the
next
town
of
any
importance
only
to
hear
that
nothing
had
been
heard
there
either
the
answer
astounded
them
an
expedition
was
sent
off
to
find
out
what
had
happened
to
the
party
they
were
nearly
a
fortnight
in
reaching
the
old
fort
the
last
spot
where
any
message
had
come
from
and
there
they
found
the
british
flag
still
flying
over
the
official
headquarters
but
both
the
bungalow
and
the
fortress
were
deserted
in
the
old
guardroom
and
the
compound
were
a
few
gnawed
human
bones
but
there
was
no
other
trace
of
the
missing
expedition
although
there
was
every
sign
that
disaster
had
overtaken
it
the
officials
were
aghast
sir
george
and
his
staff
had
completely
disappeared
that
there
had
been
fighting
was
evident
the
bones
in
the
guardroom
and
compound
told
them
that
much
but
all
trace
of
their
identity
had
been
gnawed
off
by
prowling
hyenas
the
country
around
was
scoured
but
it
brought
no
clue
the
french
government
was
communicated
with
but
it
could
throw
no
light
on
the
affair
when
the
news
reached
england
it
caused
a
sensation
for
society
culled
that
sir
george
barclay
daughter
the
lovely
heiress
pansy
langham
was
among
those
missing
dead
now
or
perhaps
worse
the
chattel
of
one
of
the
wild
marauders
who
had
fallen
so
swiftly
and
silently
upon
her
father
party
and
in
a
pleasant
english
country
house
miss
grainger
wept
for
the
bright
brave
girl
who
had
always
been
such
a
generous
friend
and
considerate
mistress
chapter
x
by
the
time
the
news
of
the
disappearance
of
sir
george
barclay
party
reached
england
pansy
was
well
on
her
way
to
she
arrived
there
one
night
after
dark
a
darkness
out
from
which
high
walls
loomed
and
over
them
strange
sounds
came
the
thin
wail
of
stringed
instruments
a
throbbing
through
the
blue
night
the
plaintive
song
of
some
itinerant
musician
and
the
shuffle
of
crowded
human
life
she
was
not
given
much
time
to
dwell
upon
those
things
her
escort
skirted
the
high
walls
a
big
arch
loomed
up
with
heavy
iron
gates
gates
that
clanged
back
as
they
approached
and
the
flare
of
torches
showed
a
long
passage
leading
into
darkness
into
the
passage
her
litter
was
carried
with
a
swaying
somnolent
movement
then
the
gates
closed
with
a
clang
behind
her
leaving
the
escort
outside
and
she
and
alice
were
alone
with
the
flaming
torches
the
black
engulfing
passage
and
half
a
dozen
huge
negroes
in
gorgeous
raiment
with
a
sickly
feeling
pansy
slipped
from
her
litter
her
journey
end
the
journey
had
lasted
over
six
weeks
under
other
circumstances
pansy
would
have
enjoyed
it
it
could
not
have
been
more
comfortable
she
had
travelled
in
the
cool
of
the
morning
and
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
always
for
the
long
midday
halt
the
same
sumptuous
tent
was
up
awaiting
her
reception
taken
down
again
after
she
had
departed
and
up
again
before
she
arrived
at
the
next
halting
place
the
country
she
travelled
through
was
an
interesting
one
and
grassy
at
first
as
the
weeks
passed
becoming
ever
more
sandy
and
arid
with
occasional
patches
that
were
wonderfully
fertile
until
finally
like
a
glowing
yellow
sea
before
her
she
had
her
first
glimpse
of
the
sahara
on
its
southern
side
billow
upon
billow
of
flaming
sand
stretching
away
to
a
tensely
blue
sky
with
here
and
there
a
stunted
bush
a
twist
of
coarse
grass
or
a
clump
of
distorted
cacti
with
red
flowers
blazing
against
the
heated
shimmering
air
a
vast
solitude
where
nothing
moved
for
a
week
they
had
journeyed
through
the
desert
late
one
evening
a
lake
came
into
view
with
fruitful
gardens
growing
around
it
where
date
palms
olives
and
clustering
vines
flourished
on
the
far
side
a
walled
city
showed
it
lay
golden
in
the
misty
glow
of
evening
its
minarets
standing
out
against
a
shadowed
sky
even
as
she
approached
it
had
been
swallowed
by
darkness
softly
the
lake
lapped
as
they
skirted
it
and
the
world
was
filled
with
a
constant
hissing
sigh
the
sound
of
shifting
sand
when
the
wind
roamed
over
it
the
voice
of
the
desert
much
as
pansy
dreaded
her
journey
end
she
welcomed
it
she
lived
for
nothing
now
but
to
see
the
sultan
to
plead
with
him
for
her
father
her
friends
herself
and
she
buoyed
herself
up
with
the
hope
that
her
own
riches
would
enable
her
to
ransom
them
all
but
if
she
failed
she
grew
sick
at
the
thought
and
the
thought
was
with
her
as
she
stood
in
the
stone
passage
her
strained
eyes
on
the
gigantic
negro
guards
who
had
come
to
escort
her
to
her
new
quarters
they
were
attired
from
head
to
foot
in
rich
brightly
coloured
silks
and
they
literally
blazed
with
jewels
the
man
who
was
their
master
might
have
so
much
money
that
he
would
prefer
revenge
this
thought
was
in
pansy
mind
some
minutes
later
when
she
sat
alone
with
her
maid
in
one
of
the
many
apartments
in
the
palace
of
it
was
a
big
room
with
walls
and
floor
of
gold
mosaic
and
a
domed
ceiling
of
where
cut
flashed
like
stars
five
golden
lamps
hung
from
it
suspended
by
golden
chains
lamps
set
with
flat
emeralds
and
rubies
and
sapphires
it
was
furnished
very
much
as
her
tent
had
been
except
that
there
were
wide
ottomans
against
the
gilded
walls
and
the
tables
and
stools
were
of
sandalwood
in
one
corner
stood
a
large
bureau
of
the
same
wood
beautifully
carved
three
heavy
pointed
doors
of
sandalwood
led
into
the
apartment
the
place
was
heavy
with
its
sensuous
odour
in
a
little
alcove
draped
with
curtains
of
gold
tissue
the
negroes
deposited
pansy
belongings
then
they
withdrew
leaving
the
girl
and
her
maid
alone
pansy
with
the
depressing
feeling
that
money
might
not
have
much
influence
with
the
sultan
casim
ammeh
two
of
the
doors
of
her
gilded
prison
were
locked
pansy
quickly
discovered
outside
of
the
one
she
had
entered
by
a
couple
of
negro
guards
were
stationed
who
refused
to
let
her
pass
on
learning
this
she
went
out
into
the
fretted
gallery
below
a
garden
lay
she
stood
at
the
head
of
the
steps
leading
into
it
anxious
to
get
away
from
the
dim
scented
silence
of
the
great
room
in
touch
with
the
trees
and
stars
and
the
cool
breath
of
night
that
she
understood
she
tried
to
argue
that
all
the
splendour
and
luxury
placed
at
her
disposal
boded
well
for
the
future
that
her
captor
might
not
be
going
to
carry
out
his
threats
her
gaze
turned
towards
the
room
with
its
wealth
and
luxury
a
fit
setting
for
a
sultan
favourite
pansy
shivered
what
price
might
she
not
have
to
pay
for
her
father
life
then
she
thought
of
raoul
le
breton
the
dark
blood
in
him
seemed
nothing
now
compared
with
the
thought
of
having
to
become
the
chattel
of
this
wild
desert
chief
slight
sounds
in
the
big
room
roused
her
from
her
reverie
she
started
violently
expecting
to
see
the
sultan
coming
to
make
his
bargain
but
only
a
couple
of
servants
were
there
the
biggest
of
the
inlaid
tables
was
set
for
dinner
a
dinner
for
one
set
in
a
european
way
and
the
meal
that
followed
was
the
work
of
a
skilled
french
but
the
sumptuous
repast
had
no
charm
for
a
girl
worried
to
death
at
the
thought
of
her
own
fate
and
her
father
to
please
alice
she
made
some
pretence
of
eating
leaving
her
maid
to
revel
in
the
neglected
dainties
pansy
went
back
to
her
vigil
in
the
arches
in
course
of
time
the
lamps
burning
low
alice
prodigious
yawns
drove
her
to
lie
wakeful
among
the
soft
cushions
of
one
of
the
ottomans
from
fitful
slumbers
alice
voice
roused
her
the
next
morning
alice
with
the
usual
early
morning
tea
a
tray
of
choice
fruit
and
a
basket
full
of
rare
and
beautiful
flowers
distastefully
pansy
looked
at
the
choice
blossoms
she
felt
they
were
from
the
sultan
to
his
unwilling
visitor
a
silent
message
of
admiration
of
homage
perhaps
take
them
away
alice
she
said
quickly
and
put
them
where
i
see
them
with
a
curious
glance
at
her
mistress
the
girl
obeyed
pansy
drank
her
tea
all
the
time
pondering
on
her
future
if
she
had
to
go
under
she
would
go
under
fighting
if
this
wild
chief
were
prepared
to
give
her
her
father
life
in
exchange
for
herself
she
would
see
that
he
got
as
little
pleasure
as
possible
out
of
his
bargain
if
he
were
infatuated
with
her
as
alice
and
edouard
seemed
to
think
so
much
the
better
all
the
more
keenly
he
would
feel
the
lashes
her
tongue
would
be
able
to
give
pansy
knew
he
spoke
french
for
this
fact
had
come
into
the
story
her
father
had
told
her
in
years
gone
by
in
thinking
of
the
cutting
things
she
would
be
able
to
lay
to
her
captor
pansy
tried
to
keep
at
bay
the
dread
she
felt
since
he
was
not
there
to
hit
at
in
person
she
hit
at
him
with
sneers
at
his
race
to
alice
i
do
suppose
there
anywhere
i
can
have
a
bath
she
remarked
when
her
tea
was
finished
cleanliness
is
one
of
the
virtues
of
these
arabs
dere
be
one
alice
assured
her
de
most
beautifullest
one
you
eber
saw
pansy
agreed
with
her
maid
some
minutes
later
when
she
was
splashing
about
in
its
cool
waters
alice
had
pointed
out
the
place
to
her
in
and
slippers
pansy
had
passed
through
the
wide
gallery
a
lacy
prison
of
stone
it
seemed
to
the
girl
for
although
it
gave
a
wide
view
of
the
desert
there
was
not
one
spot
in
its
carved
side
that
she
could
have
put
her
hand
through
immediately
beneath
lay
a
garden
surrounded
by
a
high
wall
pansy
had
seen
many
gardens
but
none
to
equal
the
one
before
her
in
peace
and
beauty
it
was
a
dream
of
roses
in
the
middle
was
a
sunken
pond
where
floated
and
carp
swam
and
gaped
at
her
with
greedy
mouths
when
her
shadow
fell
across
them
as
if
expecting
to
be
fed
vivid
green
velvety
turf
surrounded
the
pond
a
rarity
in
that
arid
country
there
was
nothing
else
in
the
garden
but
roses
of
every
shade
and
colour
they
streamed
in
cascades
over
the
high
walls
they
grew
in
banks
by
the
pond
in
trellised
alleys
and
single
bushes
the
garden
was
a
gem
of
cool
greenness
scent
and
silence
and
over
it
brooded
the
shadows
of
gigantic
cypresses
the
lay
beneath
the
stone
gallery
with
fretted
and
columned
arches
where
more
roses
clung
and
climbed
opening
directly
on
the
scented
quiet
of
the
garden
it
was
a
huge
basin
of
white
marble
about
thirty
feet
across
and
deep
enough
to
swim
in
with
a
carved
edge
delicate
as
lace
pansy
was
in
no
mood
to
appreciate
her
surroundings
and
the
beauty
of
her
prison
in
no
way
softened
her
heart
towards
her
captor
as
she
splashed
about
in
the
bath
over
the
high
walls
came
the
sound
of
bells
like
church
chimes
wrangling
in
the
distance
on
an
english
sunday
wistfully
pansy
stopped
and
listened
to
them
she
was
travelled
enough
to
recognize
them
as
camel
bells
some
train
coming
to
this
barbaric
city
when
she
returned
to
the
dim
gilded
room
breakfast
was
awaiting
her
an
ordinary
continental
breakfast
she
pecked
at
it
too
sick
at
heart
to
eat
then
she
sat
on
awaiting
edouard
appearance
he
had
parted
with
her
the
previous
night
promising
to
come
and
see
her
when
she
was
installed
in
the
palace
it
was
evening
before
he
came
pansy
greeted
him
eagerly
all
day
she
had
dreaded
that
her
captor
might
appear
but
she
wanted
to
see
him
to
satisfy
herself
about
her
father
edouard
visits
to
her
were
purely
professional
and
brief
always
his
idea
was
to
get
away
for
his
conscience
pricked
him
where
pansy
was
concerned
he
was
used
to
his
patron
wild
ways
and
he
knew
the
girl
position
was
not
of
her
own
choosing
will
you
tell
the
sultan
i
want
to
see
him
she
said
when
he
rose
to
go
has
he
paid
you
a
visit
yet
the
doctor
asked
with
surprise
no
and
i
so
worried
about
my
father
edouard
left
promising
to
deliver
her
message
but
he
came
the
next
day
saying
the
sultan
had
refused
to
grant
her
an
interview
i
wonder
why
he
wo
see
me
she
said
drearily
edouard
wondered
also
that
evening
he
dined
with
his
friend
and
patron
not
in
a
gorgeous
eastern
apartment
like
pansy
but
in
one
that
was
decidedly
western
in
its
fittings
and
appointments
and
the
sultan
was
attired
as
pansy
had
seen
him
several
times
in
grand
canary
in
black
white
pleated
shirt
and
the
black
pearl
studs
dinner
was
over
before
edouard
approached
the
subject
of
the
if
i
were
you
i
see
miss
barclay
he
said
this
suspense
wo
do
her
any
good
she
frets
all
day
about
her
father
it
not
in
my
plans
to
see
her
just
yet
the
sultan
replied
edouard
glanced
at
him
then
he
did
what
for
him
was
a
bold
thing
fat
and
comfortable
and
fond
of
his
easy
berth
as
he
was
he
challenged
his
royal
master
concerning
his
intentions
towards
the
captive
girl
what
are
your
plans
with
regard
to
miss
barclay
he
ventured
not
one
of
the
sort
who
can
be
bought
with
a
string
of
pearls
or
a
diamond
bracelet
i
going
to
marry
her
the
sultan
said
easily
edouard
experienced
a
feeling
of
relief
on
his
own
account
as
much
as
pansy
the
doctor
studied
her
with
renewed
interest
the
next
day
when
he
paid
her
his
usual
visit
if
i
sent
a
note
to
the
sultan
do
you
think
it
would
be
any
use
pansy
asked
him
anxiously
the
moment
he
had
done
with
professional
matters
it
would
do
no
harm
at
any
rate
he
replied
pansy
got
to
her
feet
quickly
she
knew
edouard
was
in
touch
with
her
captor
a
prisoner
like
herself
she
imagined
but
free
to
come
and
go
because
of
his
calling
she
did
not
know
he
was
a
man
so
faithful
to
his
master
that
the
smallest
wish
was
carried
out
to
the
letter
going
into
the
alcove
where
her
belongings
were
pansy
seated
herself
on
the
edge
of
a
couch
with
a
on
her
knee
for
some
minutes
she
stayed
frowning
at
a
blank
piece
of
paper
it
was
so
difficult
to
know
what
to
say
to
this
savage
chief
who
held
the
lives
of
her
father
and
friends
in
his
hands
after
some
minutes
thinking
she
wrote
to
the
sultan
casim
ammeh
perhaps
you
do
not
know
that
i
am
very
rich
any
price
you
may
ask
i
am
prepared
to
give
for
my
father
life
and
freedom
for
the
lives
and
freedom
of
my
english
friends
who
are
also
your
prisoners
and
for
my
own
the
ransom
will
be
paid
to
you
in
gold
all
you
will
have
to
do
will
be
to
mention
the
sum
you
want
and
allow
me
to
send
a
message
through
to
my
bank
in
england
pansy
langham
barclay
the
note
was
put
into
an
envelope
sealed
addressed
and
taken
out
to
edouard
on
handing
it
over
however
pansy
suddenly
recollected
that
the
sultan
for
all
his
wealth
and
power
might
be
ignorant
of
the
arts
of
reading
and
writing
can
he
read
french
she
asked
an
amused
look
came
to
the
doctor
face
if
he
ca
make
it
out
i
read
it
to
him
he
replied
it
was
evening
before
le
breton
got
the
note
le
breton
again
as
pansy
knew
him
in
khaki
just
as
he
had
returned
from
a
ride
on
her
old
that
had
been
brought
to
his
camp
the
day
of
her
capture
and
was
now
in
the
palace
stables
the
note
was
lying
on
his
desk
with
the
name
that
pansy
now
hated
the
sultan
casim
ammeh
written
on
the
envelope
in
her
pretty
hand
a
tender
look
hovered
about
his
mouth
as
he
picked
up
the
letter
and
read
it
again
the
girl
was
doing
her
best
for
some
helpless
creatures
his
prisoners
although
the
fact
filled
him
with
an
even
greater
admiration
for
pansy
it
did
not
lessen
his
hatred
for
her
father
he
sat
down
and
dashed
off
a
brief
reply
in
an
assumed
hand
all
the
gold
in
africa
will
not
buy
my
vengeance
from
me
casim
ammeh
his
answer
reached
pansy
with
her
dinner
reducing
her
to
despair
it
seemed
that
nothing
she
could
do
would
have
any
influence
with
this
savage
ruler
hopeless
days
followed
days
that
brought
her
nothing
but
a
series
of
elaborate
meals
yet
she
knew
that
life
went
on
around
her
a
life
quite
different
from
any
she
had
been
accustomed
to
morning
and
night
she
heard
faint
voices
wailing
from
unseen
minarets
over
the
high
walls
of
her
garden
came
the
hum
of
a
crowded
city
from
her
screened
gallery
she
saw
camel
trains
loom
out
of
the
haze
of
distance
to
with
a
wrangle
of
sweet
bells
camels
that
came
from
some
vast
unknown
and
there
was
another
sound
that
pansy
heard
a
sound
that
hailed
from
somewhere
within
the
palace
that
always
came
about
bedtime
and
always
set
her
shivering
the
sound
of
a
girl
screaming
each
morning
with
her
early
tea
there
was
a
basket
of
rare
flowers
flowers
she
did
not
trouble
to
tell
alice
to
move
now
she
put
them
down
to
some
palace
custom
nothing
that
had
any
bearing
on
the
sultan
she
never
thought
of
le
breton
words
still
only
a
few
flowers
pansy
and
each
evening
she
sat
in
the
dim
scented
room
and
waited
for
those
muffled
screams
she
knew
where
they
came
from
now
from
somewhere
behind
one
of
the
locked
doors
leading
into
her
room
limp
and
listless
she
dragged
through
the
hot
monotonous
days
brooding
on
her
own
fate
and
her
father
envying
the
ragged
black
crows
that
flew
free
like
bits
of
burnt
paper
high
in
the
scorching
sky
pansy
had
been
about
a
fortnight
in
when
something
happened
one
morning
as
she
stood
by
the
sunken
pond
feeding
the
greedy
carp
with
rolls
she
was
too
miserable
to
eat
alice
came
to
her
and
oh
miss
pansy
dey
hab
come
for
you
she
gasped
who
pansy
asked
quickly
de
sultan
soldiers
are
they
going
to
take
me
to
him
she
asked
feeling
the
interview
she
desired
and
dreaded
was
now
at
hand
dey
take
you
to
de
slave
market
to
be
sold
oh
oh
the
girl
wailed
alice
hysterical
sobs
followed
pansy
down
the
dim
passage
some
minutes
later
when
with
strained
face
and
tortured
eyes
she
went
with
a
guard
of
eight
arab
soldiers
to
meet
the
fate
the
sultan
casim
ammeh
had
promised
for
her
more
than
sixteen
years
before
chapter
xi
sir
george
barclay
and
most
of
his
staff
had
a
knowledge
of
eastern
prisons
from
the
outside
they
knew
them
to
be
abodes
of
misery
dark
insanitary
dens
alive
with
vermin
squalid
and
filthy
filled
with
a
gaunt
ragged
crowd
who
all
day
long
held
piteous
hands
through
iron
bars
begging
for
food
from
the
the
only
food
they
were
given
the
governor
staff
did
not
look
forward
to
a
sojourn
in
as
for
sir
george
himself
he
had
other
matters
than
his
own
personal
comfort
to
dwell
on
his
thoughts
were
always
with
pansy
and
always
in
his
heart
was
the
prayer
that
she
would
succumb
to
the
effects
of
cameron
bullet
and
not
have
to
meet
the
fate
his
enemy
had
in
store
for
her
after
the
one
interview
the
sultan
had
ignored
barclay
but
during
the
long
journey
sir
george
often
saw
his
enemy
and
if
he
thought
of
anything
outside
of
his
daughter
fate
it
was
to
wonder
why
casim
ammeh
looked
so
different
from
the
wild
hordes
he
ruled
exactly
like
a
man
of
the
darker
latin
type
certainly
not
the
son
of
the
savage
marauder
whom
he
barclay
had
had
to
condemn
to
death
on
reaching
the
europeans
found
the
quarters
awaiting
them
very
different
from
what
experience
had
led
them
to
expect
they
were
ushered
into
a
large
courtyard
dotted
with
trees
and
surrounded
by
high
walls
into
it
a
dozen
little
cells
opened
within
the
enclosure
they
were
free
to
wander
as
they
pleased
a
glance
around
the
place
showed
them
why
the
walls
were
twenty
feet
high
and
as
smooth
as
glass
and
there
were
always
a
dozen
arabs
stationed
by
the
gate
watching
all
they
did
at
night
they
were
each
locked
in
separate
cells
it
was
impossible
to
bribe
the
guards
as
cameron
and
his
fellow
officers
discovered
before
a
week
had
passed
for
the
imprisoned
englishmen
the
time
passed
slowly
often
they
speculated
on
their
own
ultimate
fate
whether
death
would
be
their
portion
or
whether
they
would
be
left
there
to
stew
for
years
after
the
manner
of
more
than
one
european
who
had
had
the
misfortune
to
fall
into
the
clutches
of
some
desert
chief
they
all
knew
the
reason
of
their
capture
merely
because
they
happened
to
be
on
the
governor
staff
he
had
told
them
the
story
of
casim
ammeh
and
the
promised
revenge
they
never
thought
of
blaming
barclay
what
the
present
sultan
of
called
murder
was
the
sort
of
thing
any
one
of
them
might
be
called
upon
to
do
a
day
came
when
it
seemed
to
barclay
that
the
fate
that
wild
youth
had
promised
him
long
years
ago
was
at
hand
one
morning
an
escort
came
for
him
in
their
company
he
was
led
out
of
prison
to
his
execution
he
expected
his
staff
thought
so
too
for
they
took
a
brief
unemotional
farewell
of
him
they
expected
the
same
fate
themselves
at
any
moment
however
barclay
was
not
led
to
his
death
the
escort
took
him
through
a
twist
of
narrow
streets
into
a
house
and
up
a
flight
of
dark
stairs
he
was
left
alone
in
an
upper
room
with
a
heavily
barred
window
through
which
came
a
hum
of
wild
voices
with
an
occasional
loud
guttural
excited
call
he
crossed
to
the
window
and
stood
there
riveted
there
was
a
big
square
beneath
seething
with
men
all
gazing
in
one
direction
in
the
direction
of
a
raised
platform
where
a
girl
stood
a
slim
white
girl
it
would
have
been
much
easier
for
sir
george
to
have
faced
death
than
the
sight
before
him
pansy
was
on
the
platform
his
daughter
standing
there
in
full
view
of
the
wild
crowd
being
sold
as
a
slave
in
the
market
of
this
desert
city
to
become
the
property
of
one
of
those
savages
barclay
hand
went
across
his
anguished
face
to
try
and
shut
out
the
horrible
sight
it
could
not
be
true
it
must
be
some
hideous
nightmare
yet
there
she
was
with
white
face
and
strained
eyes
meeting
her
fate
bravely
as
his
daughter
would
pansy
as
he
had
often
seen
her
in
a
simple
white
muslin
dress
and
a
wide
white
drooping
hat
with
a
long
blue
floating
veil
garbed
as
she
had
gone
about
his
camp
during
his
fatal
tour
even
as
sir
george
looked
pansy
tortured
eyes
met
his
and
she
tried
to
smile
the
sight
broke
him
utterly
bringing
a
groan
to
his
lips
at
the
sound
a
voice
said
in
french
with
a
note
of
savage
triumph
now
perhaps
understand
what
suffered
when
you
shot
my
father
standing
behind
him
was
a
big
man
in
a
khaki
a
european
he
looked
for
the
moment
barclay
did
not
know
him
for
his
enemy
the
sultan
casim
ammeh
when
he
recognised
him
he
did
for
pansy
what
he
would
never
have
done
for
himself
he
begged
for
mercy
for
god
sake
for
the
sake
of
the
civilisation
you
know
condemn
my
child
to
such
a
fate
he
entreated
in
a
voice
hoarse
with
agony
you
showed
my
father
no
mercy
why
should
i
show
you
any
now
the
sultan
asked
coldly
at
least
have
pity
on
the
girl
do
what
you
like
with
me
but
spare
my
daughter
did
you
show
me
any
pity
when
i
begged
for
my
father
life
ye
sow
so
shall
ye
reap
is
that
what
you
christians
say
there
is
your
harvest
a
pleasing
sight
for
me
when
i
think
of
my
father
the
sultan
gaze
went
to
the
window
but
there
was
more
tenderness
than
anything
else
in
his
eyes
as
they
rested
on
the
slim
girl
who
faced
the
crowd
with
such
white
courage
now
one
figure
stood
out
from
the
surge
that
of
a
big
lean
man
in
turban
and
with
long
matted
hair
and
beard
the
latter
he
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
platform
and
his
eyes
never
left
the
girl
as
he
bid
up
and
up
against
the
other
competitors
cursing
everyone
who
bid
against
him
yet
always
going
higher
look
at
that
wild
man
from
the
desert
the
sultan
said
i
know
him
he
is
a
feather
merchant
a
miser
his
home
is
a
squalid
tent
yet
he
has
more
money
than
any
man
who
comes
to
love
has
unlocked
his
heart
he
will
give
all
his
hoarded
wealth
to
possess
that
pretty
slave
on
the
platform
there
he
will
be
a
fitting
mate
for
your
daughter
think
of
her
in
his
arms
and
remember
the
man
you
murdered
my
father
the
sultan
casim
ammeh
whom
i
have
now
avenged
at
the
taunts
despite
the
difference
in
their
years
and
physique
george
barclay
turned
on
his
tormentor
you
brute
you
devil
he
cried
springing
at
him
with
easy
strength
the
sultan
caught
and
held
him
you
misjudge
me
he
said
it
justice
merely
eye
for
an
eye
and
a
tooth
for
a
tooth
then
he
pushed
the
older
man
from
him
and
turning
on
his
heel
went
from
the
room
chapter
xii
the
market
of
was
situated
in
the
centre
of
the
city
it
was
surrounded
by
a
huddle
of
whitewashed
houses
of
varying
heights
and
shapes
leaning
one
against
the
other
with
here
and
there
over
some
high
wall
a
glimpse
of
greenery
the
feathery
head
of
a
palm
the
shiny
leaves
of
a
camphor
tree
a
pomegranate
an
orange
or
a
fig
tree
on
the
side
overlooking
the
square
the
houses
were
practically
without
windows
and
the
few
there
were
were
small
and
under
most
of
the
buildings
were
dim
shops
hung
with
rare
silks
and
ostrich
feathers
or
littered
with
articles
in
beaten
silver
copper
and
iron
there
was
quaint
leatherwork
and
coarse
pottery
and
a
good
sprinkling
of
european
goods
several
narrow
streets
led
into
the
square
entering
it
in
some
cases
under
dark
archways
sometimes
these
ways
were
barred
to
the
mere
public
the
poorer
people
who
daily
sold
produce
in
the
square
and
only
those
with
special
permits
were
allowed
to
enter
men
of
wealth
and
substance
every
month
a
sale
of
slaves
was
held
in
the
market
generally
of
arab
and
negro
girls
but
occasionally
something
very
different
figured
there
perhaps
some
creamy
beauty
brought
right
across
the
sahara
from
the
barbary
states
a
thousand
miles
away
or
some
girl
from
the
soudan
even
further
afield
when
this
happened
there
were
always
plenty
of
buyers
men
of
wealth
flocked
in
from
hundreds
of
miles
around
for
any
skin
lighter
than
brown
was
a
rarity
within
the
last
few
weeks
word
had
gone
round
the
district
blown
hither
and
thither
in
the
desert
that
a
girl
even
more
beautiful
than
those
creamy
beauties
from
the
barbary
states
was
to
be
on
sale
at
the
next
auction
a
girl
hailing
from
allah
alone
knew
what
far
land
paradise
if
her
description
were
a
true
one
a
girl
with
a
skin
white
as
milk
hair
golden
as
the
sunshine
and
eyes
of
a
blue
deep
as
desert
night
a
maid
moreover
not
another
man
discarded
fancy
for
days
before
the
sale
as
flies
are
drawn
towards
a
the
caravans
of
wealthy
merchants
came
trickling
in
from
the
desert
when
the
day
itself
arrived
they
hurried
with
their
retinues
to
the
square
some
to
buy
if
possible
others
less
wealthy
to
see
if
the
maid
were
as
beautiful
as
report
said
on
one
side
of
the
market
square
was
a
raised
platform
from
the
house
behind
a
room
opened
on
it
a
big
shadowy
room
whitewashed
and
with
a
barred
window
high
up
near
the
ceiling
into
that
room
pansy
was
taken
by
her
escort
in
a
curtained
litter
during
the
journey
to
the
market
she
had
had
the
sensation
of
moving
in
some
ghastly
nightmare
from
which
she
could
not
wake
herself
much
as
she
tried
it
could
not
be
possible
that
she
pansy
langham
the
fêted
and
heiress
was
to
be
sold
as
one
might
sell
a
horse
or
a
cow
she
had
the
horrible
feeling
of
having
lost
her
own
identity
and
taken
on
someone
else
yet
all
the
time
remembering
what
had
happened
when
she
was
pansy
langham
she
felt
she
must
have
slipped
back
hundreds
of
years
to
some
previous
existence
when
girls
were
sold
as
slaves
for
surely
this
appalling
fate
could
not
be
happening
to
her
in
the
twentieth
century
a
riot
of
thought
ran
through
the
girl
head
during
the
journey
from
the
palace
to
the
market
a
riot
of
numb
sickly
terror
the
outstanding
feature
of
which
was
an
inability
to
credit
the
fate
before
her
when
pansy
reached
the
room
she
gave
up
all
hope
she
knew
she
was
awake
painfully
horribly
wide
awake
with
a
future
before
her
that
made
her
shudder
to
contemplate
there
were
a
dozen
or
more
girls
in
the
room
but
they
were
railed
off
from
pansy
by
a
thick
wooden
trellis
like
sheep
in
a
pen
brown
and
black
girls
the
majority
attired
in
nothing
more
than
a
cloth
reaching
from
waist
to
knee
they
had
been
chattering
shrilly
among
themselves
at
her
entry
apparently
in
no
way
appalled
at
the
fate
before
them
but
they
broke
off
when
she
came
in
and
crowded
to
the
lattice
to
get
a
closer
view
gazing
at
the
newcomer
and
giving
vent
to
little
exclamations
of
awe
and
envy
and
admiration
pansy
arrival
brought
a
stout
bearded
man
in
white
burnoose
in
from
the
house
behind
his
glance
ran
over
the
english
girl
but
he
made
no
attempt
to
touch
her
then
he
looked
at
her
escort
who
had
stationed
themselves
on
either
side
of
her
by
allah
he
exclaimed
this
is
a
houri
straight
from
paradise
you
have
brought
me
never
have
i
sold
such
loveliness
there
will
be
high
bidding
in
the
market
of
this
morning
i
for
one
ca
understand
why
the
sultan
has
not
kept
this
pearl
for
himself
the
leader
of
the
escort
said
the
auctioneer
smiled
in
a
peculiar
knowing
fashion
our
sultan
has
been
in
lands
where
there
are
many
such
he
replied
now
he
gives
his
subjects
a
chance
to
revel
in
delights
that
have
been
his
other
men
appeared
from
behind
negroes
at
a
word
from
their
master
they
opened
the
door
leading
out
on
the
platform
then
they
stood
on
either
side
whilst
he
passed
through
through
the
open
door
came
a
blaze
of
sunshine
the
buzz
of
a
multitude
and
presently
a
long
declamation
in
arabic
as
the
auctioneer
enlarged
upon
the
quality
of
his
wares
the
girls
behind
the
trellis
craned
their
necks
to
see
what
was
going
on
chattering
shrilly
among
themselves
from
where
pansy
stood
she
could
see
nothing
she
did
not
want
to
see
anything
the
horror
would
be
upon
her
quite
soon
enough
one
of
the
negro
assistants
opened
a
gate
in
the
trellis
and
motioned
to
a
girl
as
she
appeared
on
the
platform
from
outside
there
came
a
sigh
of
disappointment
then
guttural
voices
bidding
another
and
another
of
the
girls
passed
out
all
apparently
indifferent
to
the
ordeal
before
them
then
the
auctioneer
appeared
on
the
threshold
on
seeing
him
pansy
felt
her
turn
had
come
and
the
world
started
reeling
around
her
she
knew
she
passed
from
shadow
into
sunshine
that
dead
silence
greeted
her
appearance
on
the
dais
a
silence
that
was
followed
by
a
din
of
wild
excited
shouting
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
world
was
nothing
but
eyes
the
eyes
of
a
surging
crowd
of
men
watching
her
with
desire
and
admiration
to
pansy
and
fastidious
it
was
a
vision
of
hell
this
swarm
of
wild
men
looking
at
her
with
covetous
desire
the
pit
gaped
at
her
feet
peopled
with
demons
any
one
of
which
might
spring
upon
her
then
the
din
died
down
to
a
subdued
hum
as
men
whispered
one
to
another
their
eyes
still
on
the
girl
on
the
dais
there
was
a
horrible
sort
of
despair
on
the
faces
of
some
as
they
thought
of
their
more
wealthy
neighbours
lustful
triumph
on
the
faces
of
others
as
they
thought
of
their
own
hoarded
gold
illustration
for
sale
as
a
common
slave
at
the
taureg
auction
block
then
out
from
the
crowd
a
voice
made
an
offer
the
sum
staggered
the
auctioneer
it
equalled
nearly
five
hundred
pounds
of
english
money
no
girl
even
the
creamy
barbary
beauties
had
ever
fetched
that
amount
wild
commotion
followed
but
the
price
went
up
and
up
doubling
itself
in
ten
minutes
to
escape
for
a
moment
from
the
sea
of
covetous
eyes
pansy
raised
her
own
there
was
someone
watching
her
from
a
window
someone
who
looked
as
tortured
as
herself
another
soul
condemned
to
hell
it
was
a
moment
before
she
recognised
that
drawn
haggard
face
as
her
fathers
it
looked
an
old
man
he
was
there
the
father
she
loved
condemned
by
his
enemy
to
see
her
sold
she
tried
to
smile
it
was
a
woeful
effort
and
when
the
blur
of
tears
that
seeing
him
brought
to
her
eyes
had
passed
he
was
gone
it
seemed
to
pansy
that
for
an
eternity
she
stood
on
the
edge
of
the
pit
waiting
until
one
of
the
devils
more
powerful
than
the
rest
should
drag
her
in
the
din
died
down
as
the
sale
proceeded
lost
in
tense
excitement
of
the
twenty
or
more
who
had
started
bidding
for
her
only
three
were
left
now
one
of
them
mad
with
lust
and
excitement
had
forced
his
way
up
to
the
edge
of
the
dais
and
was
clinging
to
it
with
grimy
hands
a
lean
man
in
turban
and
only
with
long
matted
hair
and
beard
who
foaming
at
the
mouth
was
cursing
his
competitors
yet
always
bidding
higher
as
he
stared
at
pansy
with
the
glare
of
a
maddened
beast
pansy
tried
not
to
see
him
but
he
was
always
there
horrible
beyond
comprehension
the
worst
of
the
demons
in
the
hell
surrounding
her
presently
over
the
murmur
of
the
crowd
came
the
thunder
of
a
hoofs
of
someone
riding
at
breakneck
speed
through
one
of
the
resounding
arches
leading
into
the
market
pansy
did
not
notice
this
she
realised
nothing
now
but
the
foaming
horror
at
her
feet
suddenly
another
cry
rang
through
the
fortunately
for
le
breton
plans
pansy
knew
no
arabic
or
she
would
have
recognised
that
cry
as
the
sultan
the
sultan
for
casim
ammeh
had
had
his
vengeance
and
now
had
come
in
pursuit
of
love
the
cry
grew
to
such
a
roar
of
sound
that
it
penetrated
the
world
of
dumb
terror
in
which
pansy
moved
and
made
her
raise
her
eyes
the
crowd
in
the
square
had
opened
up
giving
way
to
a
man
on
a
huge
prancing
black
stallion
across
the
tortured
blue
eyes
met
fiery
black
ones
then
it
seemed
to
pansy
that
she
must
be
dreaming
a
vision
of
heaven
beyond
this
hell
for
raoul
le
breton
was
there
a
god
among
these
demons
some
figment
of
her
own
creating
that
must
vanish
as
she
gazed
but
he
did
not
vanish
he
came
closer
straight
towards
her
the
crowd
receding
like
a
wave
before
him
raoul
le
breton
looking
more
handsome
more
arrogant
more
of
a
king
than
ever
sitting
his
black
horse
like
a
centaur
pansy
hands
went
to
her
heart
and
the
world
started
spinning
around
her
like
a
knight
of
old
he
had
come
to
her
rescue
how
he
could
have
got
there
she
was
in
no
condition
to
consider
it
was
enough
that
he
was
there
in
time
to
save
her
from
the
pit
of
hell
gaping
at
her
feet
he
rode
ride
up
to
the
dais
reining
in
at
her
side
with
outstretched
arms
he
went
towards
her
come
heart
ease
my
own
brave
little
girl
there
nothing
to
fear
now
he
said
swaying
slightly
pansy
looked
at
him
again
as
if
he
were
some
vision
then
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
fainted
with
a
little
laugh
of
tender
triumph
he
caught
her
and
lifted
her
on
his
horse
as
he
turned
to
go
grimy
covetous
hands
clutched
pansy
skirts
the
hands
of
the
miser
feather
merchant
with
a
savage
oath
the
sultan
raised
his
heavy
riding
whip
and
felled
the
defiler
then
he
rode
off
with
pansy
but
before
this
happened
sir
george
barclay
had
been
taken
from
the
room
overlooking
the
slave
market
he
did
not
see
the
sultan
casim
ammeh
come
in
person
to
save
the
girl
he
did
not
know
that
in
pansy
case
at
any
rate
the
auction
had
been
but
a
pretence
chapter
xiii
when
pansy
returned
to
consciousness
she
felt
she
had
awakened
from
some
nightmare
and
was
back
in
her
own
world
a
civilized
world
her
capture
by
the
sultan
casim
ammeh
and
all
the
subsequent
happenings
some
wild
dream
terrifying
in
its
reality
as
dreams
can
be
she
was
lying
on
a
big
bed
in
a
shady
room
among
sheets
and
pillows
of
finest
linen
a
solid
brass
bedstead
such
as
might
have
come
from
any
good
shop
in
london
not
among
silken
cushions
and
rugs
on
an
ottoman
and
there
was
a
bedroom
suite
of
some
choice
grey
wood
with
a
litter
of
gold
toilet
appointments
on
the
wide
an
elderly
woman
brown
skinned
and
black
eyed
dressed
in
a
swathing
of
white
muslin
was
seated
by
the
bedside
fanning
herself
with
a
gentle
regular
movement
and
the
air
was
fresh
with
the
scent
of
beyond
the
woman
all
down
one
side
of
the
room
ran
a
series
of
arches
over
which
were
drawn
blinds
of
split
bamboo
with
the
feeling
of
fragments
of
her
nightmare
still
clinging
about
her
pansy
sat
up
then
with
a
rush
came
back
the
scene
in
the
slave
market
where
is
mr
le
breton
she
asked
in
a
dazed
manner
she
expected
the
woman
to
disclaim
all
knowledge
of
any
such
person
however
she
rose
immediately
i
fetch
him
she
said
in
french
she
made
towards
a
curtained
doorway
pansy
watched
her
go
and
her
gaze
stayed
anxiously
on
the
spot
where
the
woman
had
disappeared
a
few
moments
passed
and
the
curtains
were
drawn
aside
again
the
woman
entered
in
her
wake
was
a
big
man
in
white
drill
with
sleek
black
hair
and
a
black
moustache
on
seeing
him
pansy
gave
a
little
hysterical
cry
oh
raoul
i
was
so
afraid
you
were
just
a
dream
no
i
not
a
dream
but
a
solid
fact
he
replied
going
towards
her
come
quite
close
i
want
to
touch
you
to
make
sure
nothing
loath
he
seated
himself
on
the
bed
pansy
took
one
of
his
hands
holding
it
in
a
tight
nervous
grip
yes
it
is
really
you
she
said
in
the
whole
wide
world
there
no
one
who
feels
quite
the
same
as
you
she
had
forgotten
his
coldness
and
harshness
on
the
occasion
of
their
last
meeting
in
grand
canary
his
colour
his
religion
everything
except
that
he
was
there
and
she
was
safe
he
laughed
tenderly
and
put
the
loose
curls
back
from
her
face
with
a
lingering
caressing
touch
it
was
pansy
as
he
had
never
known
her
frightened
and
clinging
to
him
pansy
as
he
would
have
her
looking
at
him
with
eyes
full
of
love
so
little
girl
you
quite
pleased
to
see
me
did
you
buy
me
she
asked
in
a
bewildered
voice
how
else
could
i
get
you
he
asked
smiling
slightly
his
voice
and
touch
calmed
her
a
little
but
how
did
get
here
she
asked
you
know
i
an
african
merchant
do
you
he
said
easily
this
is
my
special
province
i
do
most
of
the
trading
in
this
part
and
is
my
headquarters
but
how
did
you
know
was
here
she
asked
in
a
dazed
tone
you
told
me
you
were
coming
out
to
africa
i
heard
the
governor
of
the
adjacent
english
colony
was
on
tour
his
ultimate
point
a
spot
some
six
hundred
miles
or
so
from
here
some
weeks
ago
the
sultan
went
out
on
a
foray
returning
with
some
english
prisoners
a
girl
among
them
there
are
not
many
girls
in
these
parts
pansy
so
i
guessed
who
she
was
it
all
sounded
very
feasible
and
pansy
was
in
no
mood
to
dispute
with
miracles
he
hates
my
father
that
why
he
did
it
she
began
in
a
weak
wild
way
never
mind
about
that
just
now
he
replied
fortunately
i
was
there
to
save
you
she
clung
tighter
to
the
strong
sinewy
hand
that
had
snatched
her
back
from
the
brink
of
hell
oh
raoul
what
would
have
happened
if
you
had
come
she
whispered
well
i
did
come
so
there
nothing
more
for
you
to
worry
about
he
said
tenderly
there
my
father
the
sultan
has
threatened
to
kill
him
she
began
hysterically
you
must
worry
about
your
father
either
leave
things
to
me
you
may
be
sure
i
do
my
best
for
him
too
under
the
tension
of
the
last
few
weeks
and
the
final
reaction
pansy
broke
down
completely
in
a
weak
wild
manner
she
started
sobbing
almost
as
if
her
brain
had
snapped
under
the
strain
and
relief
evidently
le
breton
had
expected
something
of
the
sort
going
to
a
table
he
poured
some
water
into
a
glass
and
dropped
a
couple
of
cachets
into
it
when
they
had
melted
he
came
back
to
the
distraught
girl
seating
himself
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
he
slipped
an
arm
around
her
come
drink
this
up
he
said
authoritatively
then
when
you
had
a
good
sleep
you
can
tell
me
all
your
adventures
i
dare
go
to
sleep
she
sobbed
for
fear
i
should
wake
up
in
hell
he
drew
the
golden
head
on
his
shoulder
with
a
soothing
protective
touch
i
stay
with
you
and
see
that
does
happen
he
said
tenderly
at
the
promise
pansy
drank
the
proffered
draught
then
she
lay
back
among
the
pillows
he
held
the
empty
glass
towards
the
arab
woman
she
took
it
and
would
have
gone
from
the
room
as
she
was
accustomed
to
going
when
the
sultan
pleased
to
linger
with
any
one
of
his
slave
girls
but
his
voice
stopped
her
there
no
need
to
go
sara
he
said
then
he
stayed
smiling
down
at
the
worn
little
face
on
the
pillows
until
the
wild
blue
eyes
closed
in
drugged
slumber
afterwards
he
sat
watching
pansy
in
a
calculating
manner
just
then
it
seemed
to
le
breton
that
his
plans
had
succeeded
that
he
was
going
to
have
all
he
wanted
revenge
he
had
had
love
now
seemed
within
his
grip
a
sense
of
gratitude
for
her
supposed
rescue
in
conjunction
with
the
love
pansy
still
had
for
him
would
be
a
strong
enough
combination
to
make
her
forget
his
colour
and
bring
her
into
his
arms
in
the
way
he
wanted
of
her
own
free
will
yet
he
was
not
wholly
satisfied
for
the
method
he
had
used
to
attain
his
ends
was
not
one
a
civilised
person
would
approve
of
a
huddled
heap
against
one
of
the
fluted
columns
old
sara
sat
and
watched
him
from
time
to
time
she
muttered
to
herself
and
cracked
her
knuckles
for
luck
and
to
keep
off
the
evil
eye
she
had
seen
another
sultan
bewitched
by
one
of
these
lovely
white
girls
and
she
hoped
that
this
girl
would
prove
kinder
to
the
son
than
the
lady
annette
had
been
to
the
father
chapter
xiv
great
stars
flashed
in
a
desert
sky
a
sky
deep
and
soft
like
purple
velvet
they
looked
down
on
a
sea
of
sand
over
which
the
wind
roamed
and
always
and
ever
in
its
train
there
followed
a
sighing
hiss
sometimes
loud
sometimes
soft
but
always
there
a
constant
stealthy
menace
in
the
night
in
the
dark
depths
one
great
curling
billow
of
sand
showed
the
coarse
grass
that
fringed
its
crest
looking
like
spray
lashing
through
the
night
beneath
a
little
yellow
fire
glowed
in
the
glimmer
a
few
ragged
tents
stood
patched
and
squalid
dwellings
among
them
mangy
camels
lay
and
groaned
and
gurgled
and
snored
with
their
long
necks
stretched
along
the
sand
looking
like
prehistoric
beasts
here
and
there
men
and
boys
slept
and
gaunt
dogs
prowled
slinking
furtive
shadows
through
the
encampment
nosing
about
for
scraps
of
the
evening
meal
there
had
been
no
meal
for
the
owner
of
the
caravan
that
night
a
hunger
that
could
not
be
assuaged
with
food
and
a
thirst
that
no
drink
could
quench
raged
within
him
now
a
burning
lust
kept
sleep
at
bay
and
sent
him
prowling
like
some
wild
beast
into
the
desert
hoping
that
there
relief
might
be
found
but
for
him
none
was
to
be
had
there
the
blue
of
the
sky
was
like
the
eyes
of
the
girl
he
had
lost
her
skin
had
rivalled
the
stars
in
its
purity
the
very
fire
that
burnt
outside
of
his
squalid
home
mocked
him
it
was
golden
as
her
hair
but
for
the
sultan
that
girl
would
be
his
now
this
night
his
to
hold
within
his
arms
that
maid
he
flung
his
arms
out
to
the
night
then
strained
them
across
his
chest
but
for
the
sultan
all
that
maddening
beauty
would
lie
within
his
grip
his
to
crush
and
caress
his
the
thought
was
torture
curse
him
curse
him
curse
him
he
cried
aloud
to
the
mocking
night
then
he
stretched
grimy
paws
towards
a
voiceless
heaven
allah
give
him
into
my
hands
the
sultan
casim
ammeh
who
has
robbed
me
of
the
flower
of
my
desire
that
maid
a
houri
of
thy
sending
guide
my
step
to
those
who
are
his
enemies
to
those
who
would
break
him
as
he
has
broken
me
surely
a
man
so
mighty
has
others
as
mighty
who
hate
him
there
are
always
kings
ready
to
make
war
on
other
kings
allah
most
high
let
me
find
them
allah
most
merciful
grant
my
prayer
like
the
wind
in
the
desert
i
will
roam
to
the
east
the
west
the
north
the
south
until
i
find
his
enemies
then
i
will
deliver
him
unto
their
hands
the
mad
prayer
of
a
wandering
feather
merchant
against
his
sultan
the
prayer
of
a
man
whom
in
his
wealth
and
power
and
arrogance
casim
ammeh
had
not
considered
but
one
which
was
to
bear
fruit
chapter
xv
giving
no
thought
to
the
grimy
wretch
out
there
in
the
desert
the
sultan
was
seated
in
one
of
the
deep
open
galleries
of
his
palace
some
ten
feet
below
a
garden
sighed
and
the
soft
wind
that
wandered
in
and
out
of
the
fretted
arches
was
ladened
with
the
scent
of
a
thousand
flowers
close
at
hand
a
fountain
whispered
and
from
the
distance
came
the
gentle
lap
of
the
lake
however
he
noticed
none
of
these
things
there
was
something
of
far
greater
interest
close
beside
him
among
the
cushions
of
a
wicker
lounge
pansy
lay
her
head
pillowed
on
silk
and
down
a
worn
look
still
on
her
face
night
had
fallen
before
she
awoke
from
her
drugged
slumber
she
had
found
le
breton
still
beside
her
and
the
room
full
of
the
soft
glow
of
shaded
lamps
once
she
was
fully
awake
he
had
left
promising
to
come
again
after
dinner
she
had
dined
in
the
gallery
the
roofed
terrace
was
lighted
by
the
glow
coming
from
the
two
rooms
behind
one
was
her
bedroom
the
other
a
gorgeously
appointed
but
at
the
end
of
these
two
rooms
an
iron
grille
went
across
the
gallery
stopping
all
further
investigations
when
le
breton
came
he
found
pansy
on
the
terrace
once
he
was
seated
she
told
him
what
had
happened
to
her
father
party
then
she
went
back
to
the
beginning
sixteen
years
before
with
the
story
of
the
youthful
sultan
but
she
did
not
mention
that
she
had
been
wounded
and
ill
for
fear
of
having
to
meet
a
host
of
anxious
enquiries
without
comment
he
listened
when
she
finished
all
he
said
was
well
i
suppose
the
sultan
has
his
point
of
view
since
it
appears
your
father
was
responsible
for
the
death
of
his
but
it
was
my
father
duty
to
condemn
him
he
would
hate
doing
it
for
he
ca
bear
to
hurt
people
it
was
not
as
the
present
sultan
seems
to
think
to
this
le
breton
had
nothing
to
say
you
must
let
the
french
government
know
my
father
is
a
prisoner
here
she
went
on
then
they
send
an
expedition
and
rescue
him
and
his
officers
i
could
do
that
pansy
you
forget
i
half
arab
i
ca
go
back
on
my
father
people
pansy
had
forgotten
this
fact
about
him
and
it
seemed
her
freedom
was
not
quite
so
close
at
hand
as
she
had
imagined
could
i
send
my
father
a
note
she
asked
anxiously
that
cruel
sultan
sent
him
to
see
me
sold
it
must
have
been
torture
for
him
for
i
all
he
got
and
he
awfully
fond
of
me
i
want
to
say
i
safe
here
with
you
i
ca
bear
to
think
of
him
in
torment
write
a
note
if
you
like
and
i
see
what
i
can
do
he
replied
at
once
she
got
up
and
went
into
the
where
she
had
noticed
a
the
place
was
more
like
a
hall
than
a
room
a
spreading
columned
apartment
with
walls
and
floor
and
ceiling
of
white
marble
where
fountains
played
into
basins
and
palms
stood
in
huge
gilded
tubs
there
were
deep
soft
chairs
and
lounges
a
sprinkling
of
gilded
tables
and
a
large
grand
piano
some
minutes
later
pansy
returned
to
her
host
with
a
letter
in
her
hand
he
took
it
and
then
rose
to
go
you
must
sit
up
too
late
he
said
looking
down
at
her
with
an
air
of
possession
you
had
a
trying
day
and
do
worry
any
more
about
anything
or
anybody
so
saying
he
left
her
full
of
gratitude
pansy
watched
him
go
and
her
conscience
smote
her
on
the
whole
she
had
treated
him
rather
badly
she
had
promised
to
marry
him
and
then
had
gone
back
on
her
word
she
did
not
deserve
his
kindness
and
consideration
he
had
been
so
cold
and
harsh
that
night
on
her
yacht
in
grand
canary
he
was
none
of
these
things
now
he
was
just
as
he
had
been
during
their
one
brief
week
of
friendship
but
even
nicer
pansy
sighed
and
her
face
grew
wistful
why
was
he
just
like
other
men
why
had
fate
been
so
unkind
giving
her
love
but
in
such
a
form
that
pride
revolted
from
taking
it
then
pansy
went
to
bed
to
lie
awake
for
some
time
brooding
on
the
miracle
the
day
had
brought
forth
and
the
black
barrier
that
stood
between
her
and
her
lover
she
was
about
early
the
next
morning
and
wandering
in
the
garden
it
was
a
long
stretch
of
shady
walks
and
sunken
ponds
and
splashing
fountains
full
of
tropical
trees
scented
shrubs
and
rare
blossoms
a
tangle
of
delights
in
one
spot
she
found
a
tennis
court
walled
with
pink
roses
the
grounds
went
on
ending
in
a
wide
flagged
terrace
with
stone
seats
and
shallow
steps
leading
down
to
the
blue
waters
of
the
lake
high
walls
ran
down
either
side
of
the
spreading
garden
behind
a
huge
building
rose
in
domes
and
turrets
and
terraces
the
palace
of
had
pansy
but
known
it
of
which
her
new
quarters
were
but
a
further
portion
blissfully
ignorant
of
this
fact
she
turned
her
steps
from
the
rippling
lake
and
wandered
along
a
path
that
twisted
under
shady
trees
and
arches
coming
presently
to
a
locked
iron
gate
let
into
the
massive
walls
it
gave
a
view
of
a
scorched
paddock
where
a
dozen
or
more
horses
were
browsing
pansy
paused
and
scanned
the
animals
one
was
strangely
familiar
that
gaunt
chestnut
browsing
there
could
only
be
the
sultan
amazed
at
her
discovery
she
called
the
horse
by
name
at
once
the
brown
head
was
up
and
the
beast
came
galloping
in
her
direction
even
in
the
days
of
her
illness
and
during
her
imprisonment
in
the
palace
pansy
had
spared
a
thought
for
her
protégé
she
imagined
he
had
become
the
property
of
one
of
the
arab
raiders
and
she
hoped
his
new
master
would
be
kind
to
him
and
understand
him
as
she
did
through
the
iron
bars
pansy
caressed
her
pet
i
never
expected
to
see
you
again
sultan
old
boy
she
said
raoul
must
have
bought
you
too
she
was
standing
there
talking
to
and
petting
the
animal
when
le
breton
step
roused
her
are
you
pleased
to
see
him
again
he
asked
after
greeting
her
pleased
is
the
word
for
it
but
how
did
you
manage
to
get
hold
of
him
he
was
really
the
cause
of
my
getting
hold
of
you
he
replied
without
hesitation
i
saw
him
in
the
possession
of
one
of
the
soldiers
who
had
come
back
from
that
foray
that
made
me
doubly
certain
who
the
white
girl
was
whom
the
sultan
was
going
to
put
up
for
sale
raoul
you
must
let
me
give
you
back
all
you
had
to
pay
for
me
she
said
why
should
you
he
asked
a
slight
smile
hovering
about
his
lips
you
saved
my
life
now
we
is
that
what
you
called
it
pansy
did
not
argue
the
point
nevertheless
she
determined
to
repay
him
once
she
and
her
father
were
back
in
civilisation
how
long
will
it
take
to
get
my
father
free
she
asked
it
all
depends
on
the
sort
of
mood
i
catch
the
sultan
in
with
the
best
of
luck
it
be
some
weeks
has
he
got
my
note
yet
do
you
think
she
asked
anxiously
he
go
grey
with
worrying
over
me
i
ca
bear
to
think
of
the
look
on
his
face
when
he
saw
me
in
that
that
awful
slave
market
le
breton
had
destroyed
her
message
the
moment
he
had
reached
his
own
rooms
now
he
could
not
meet
the
beautiful
eyes
that
looked
at
him
with
such
perfect
trust
i
expect
the
message
will
get
through
before
the
day
is
out
he
answered
it
merely
a
matter
of
at
his
words
the
world
became
quite
a
nice
place
again
for
pansy
the
only
shadow
in
it
now
the
dark
blood
in
her
lover
chapter
xvi
night
filled
the
harem
with
shadows
and
scent
the
silver
lamps
cast
a
soft
glow
through
the
huge
hall
glinting
on
wide
ottomans
and
piles
of
cushions
on
little
tables
set
with
coffee
and
sherbet
sweets
and
fruit
and
cigarettes
there
were
perhaps
thirty
women
in
the
great
room
but
the
majority
of
them
were
the
attendants
of
the
girls
lolling
on
couches
and
cushions
around
the
splashing
fountain
full
length
on
a
wide
ottoman
leonora
was
stretched
her
dark
eyes
fixed
spitefully
on
an
adjacent
lounge
where
the
arab
girl
lay
her
face
hidden
in
the
cushions
her
golden
form
almost
buried
in
her
wealth
of
black
hair
see
rayma
it
night
again
leonora
said
malice
in
her
soft
drawling
voice
night
and
still
our
lord
casim
has
not
come
to
visit
you
there
was
a
sob
from
the
other
girl
but
no
reply
how
you
jeered
at
me
rayma
when
you
stole
his
heart
from
me
leonora
went
on
but
now
it
seems
another
has
stolen
his
heart
from
you
since
he
no
longer
comes
to
see
you
another
whom
i
shall
welcome
as
a
sister
at
the
taunt
rayma
sat
up
suddenly
with
a
wild
gesture
pushing
the
mass
of
black
hair
back
from
her
face
for
weeks
and
weeks
he
has
not
been
here
she
wailed
oh
my
heart
it
breaks
for
love
of
him
leonora
laughed
but
an
elderly
woman
sitting
near
laid
a
soothing
hand
on
the
distraught
girl
hush
rayma
my
pearl
she
said
have
i
often
told
you
our
sultan
has
had
thoughts
for
nothing
but
vengeance
of
late
would
vengeance
keep
him
away
from
me
all
these
weeks
it
more
than
vengeance
it
love
love
for
some
other
girl
rayma
clutched
at
the
woman
with
slim
jewelled
hands
tell
me
sara
you
come
and
go
at
will
through
the
palace
is
there
one
my
pearl
if
there
was
one
would
she
be
here
in
the
harem
sara
answered
diplomatically
yes
and
so
she
would
rayma
replied
more
quietly
and
i
could
measure
my
beauty
against
hers
then
she
started
rocking
herself
to
and
fro
in
an
agony
of
grief
did
he
but
come
my
love
my
lord
casim
his
heart
would
be
mine
again
she
sobbed
then
she
stopped
wailing
suddenly
and
faced
the
old
woman
anxiously
sara
tell
me
quickly
have
these
weeks
of
weeping
made
me
less
beautiful
however
she
did
not
wait
for
any
reply
her
gaze
went
to
the
arches
where
night
looked
in
at
her
mockingly
look
it
is
night
she
cried
and
my
heart
is
hungry
for
love
for
the
love
of
my
lord
casim
for
his
arms
his
kisses
again
it
is
night
and
he
has
not
come
then
through
the
vaulted
room
piercing
shriek
after
piercing
shriek
rang
the
shrieks
of
a
lovesick
girl
in
the
throes
of
hysteria
as
sara
sat
patting
rayma
hands
and
trying
to
soothe
her
she
thought
of
the
maid
with
the
wide
blue
eyes
and
the
golden
curls
whom
the
sultan
himself
had
brought
unconscious
to
his
palace
and
who
was
lodged
as
no
other
slave
girl
had
ever
been
in
his
own
private
suite
and
who
treated
her
master
as
no
other
slave
had
ever
treated
him
as
if
she
were
his
equal
even
his
superior
making
him
wait
on
her
a
task
the
sultan
seemed
to
find
pleasure
in
chapter
xvii
on
the
terrace
of
her
quarters
pansy
sat
at
dinner
with
her
host
three
days
had
passed
since
her
rescue
from
the
three
delightful
days
for
the
girl
assured
of
her
own
safety
her
coming
freedom
and
the
welfare
of
her
friends
during
the
time
le
breton
had
been
with
her
almost
constantly
from
breakfast
time
until
after
dinner
always
at
her
disposal
ready
to
fall
in
with
her
wishes
so
long
as
they
did
not
entail
too
much
exertion
on
her
part
she
was
anxious
to
be
on
the
sultan
and
off
for
a
long
gallop
but
this
he
vetoed
firmly
it
would
cause
too
much
of
a
sensation
he
had
said
in
this
country
women
do
ride
about
on
horseback
we
should
have
the
whole
city
at
our
heels
pansy
had
no
desire
for
this
to
happen
lest
the
sultan
casim
should
learn
she
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
a
friend
and
snatch
her
away
from
her
rescuer
so
she
did
not
urge
further
but
it
was
on
account
of
her
health
and
not
the
idea
of
a
crowd
of
his
own
subjects
that
made
le
breton
refuse
this
indulgence
for
fear
she
should
not
be
strong
enough
to
stand
the
shaking
he
was
quite
willing
to
take
her
rowing
on
the
lake
to
play
croquet
with
her
or
a
game
of
billiards
but
most
of
all
willing
to
sit
at
her
side
in
the
peaceful
scented
garden
or
in
the
cool
gallery
or
the
watching
her
an
occupation
that
pansy
with
an
extensive
knowledge
of
men
and
their
ways
knew
the
ultimate
end
of
an
end
she
was
doing
her
best
to
keep
at
bay
but
in
spite
of
everything
she
had
the
feeling
of
being
a
prisoner
the
iron
grilles
at
either
end
of
the
long
gallery
were
never
unlocked
nor
was
the
gate
into
the
paddock
there
was
never
a
boat
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
leading
to
the
lake
except
when
le
breton
was
with
her
she
had
explored
her
quarters
further
beyond
the
there
was
a
combined
and
library
and
its
one
exit
led
into
a
sort
of
big
alcove
beyond
that
was
her
host
bedroom
as
to
her
dismay
she
had
discovered
on
opening
the
door
for
she
had
found
him
there
in
shirt
sleeves
and
trousers
with
a
valet
who
on
seeing
her
had
melted
away
discreetly
pansy
would
have
melted
away
also
but
it
was
too
late
in
a
perfectly
unperturbed
manner
le
breton
had
crossed
to
her
side
so
pansy
you
come
to
pay
me
a
visit
he
said
teasingly
hardly
the
sort
of
thing
i
expected
of
you
i
no
idea
she
began
in
a
confused
manner
there
no
need
to
make
excuses
you
find
all
the
roads
here
lead
to
mecca
and
i
always
pleased
to
see
you
he
broke
in
in
the
same
teasing
strain
if
you
kept
your
promise
we
should
be
quite
a
staid
married
couple
by
now
and
you
be
free
to
come
and
go
in
my
apartments
think
of
it
pansy
pansy
thought
of
it
and
her
face
went
crimson
her
blushes
made
him
laugh
to
the
sound
of
his
laughter
soft
and
mocking
she
retreated
and
she
did
not
explore
in
that
direction
again
she
explored
by
way
of
her
own
bedroom
instead
only
to
find
that
led
into
his
study
and
after
that
she
did
no
more
exploring
for
it
seemed
that
all
roads
did
lead
to
mecca
whichever
way
she
turned
raoul
le
breton
was
there
coming
between
her
and
the
man
she
feared
and
hated
the
sultan
casim
ammeh
i
feel
like
a
prisoner
she
remarked
on
one
occasion
they
were
sitting
by
the
lake
under
the
shade
of
fragrant
trees
with
the
blue
water
lapping
the
marble
steps
and
the
sun
setting
over
the
desert
a
gilded
world
where
a
golden
sunset
edged
the
golden
sand
one
flaming
yellow
sea
above
another
you
a
novelty
here
he
replied
a
pearl
of
great
price
if
i
did
keep
you
well
guarded
there
would
be
a
hundred
ready
to
steal
you
and
i
flatter
myself
that
on
the
whole
you
rather
be
with
me
he
paused
watching
her
with
dark
smouldering
eyes
am
i
right
heart
ease
he
finished
tenderly
pansy
coloured
slightly
under
the
ardour
of
his
gaze
had
he
been
as
other
men
were
she
would
not
have
hesitated
in
her
reply
she
would
have
said
in
her
own
impulsive
truthful
way
i
rather
be
with
you
than
anyone
in
the
whole
wide
world
but
now
his
colour
and
religion
were
constantly
before
her
and
pride
kept
any
such
confession
from
her
lips
so
instead
she
said
no
one
could
have
been
kinder
than
you
raoul
i
can
never
be
grateful
enough
his
kindness
had
been
before
her
that
night
when
she
dressed
for
dinner
pansy
had
no
clothes
except
the
ones
in
which
he
had
brought
her
but
within
three
days
there
was
an
elaborate
wardrobe
at
her
disposal
the
frocks
fashioned
like
those
she
had
worn
in
grand
canary
in
one
of
these
dresses
she
now
sat
at
dinner
with
him
a
misty
robe
of
chiffon
but
there
were
no
diamonds
sparkling
like
dew
upon
it
all
her
jewels
had
been
left
behind
in
the
dim
gilded
room
in
the
palace
of
when
dinner
was
over
as
they
sat
together
in
the
le
breton
remarked
on
the
fact
they
stolen
all
your
pretty
jewels
pansy
he
said
you
must
let
me
give
you
some
others
you
done
quite
enough
for
me
already
she
replied
promptly
i
can
manage
without
jewels
until
i
get
back
to
england
at
her
words
his
eyes
narrowed
could
you
be
content
to
stay
here
he
asked
in
a
rather
abrupt
manner
for
a
few
weeks
perhaps
then
i
should
be
craving
change
and
variety
light
of
the
harem
act
is
one
that
would
satisfy
me
for
long
then
pansy
was
sorry
she
had
spoken
she
remembered
that
he
had
admitted
to
having
a
harem
probably
somewhere
in
this
very
house
but
she
had
spoken
with
the
idea
of
letting
him
see
his
case
was
hopeless
of
saving
him
the
pain
of
refusal
considering
how
ill
you
been
the
of
the
harem
act
as
you
call
it
would
be
the
best
sort
of
life
for
you
for
some
time
to
come
how
do
you
know
i
been
ill
she
asked
quickly
le
breton
saw
he
had
made
a
slip
but
he
covered
it
up
smartly
gossip
told
me
he
said
coolly
there
was
silence
for
a
time
during
which
he
sat
with
his
gaze
on
her
why
do
you
smoke
pansy
asked
suddenly
anxious
to
get
something
between
herself
and
him
when
you
about
i
do
need
any
soothing
syrups
he
replied
he
was
approaching
dangerous
ground
again
to
ward
him
off
pansy
rose
and
went
to
the
piano
seating
herself
there
she
wandered
from
one
item
to
another
with
scarcely
a
pause
between
but
the
feeling
of
his
eyes
never
off
her
made
her
stop
all
at
once
and
laugh
hysterically
a
crisis
had
to
be
faced
sooner
or
later
things
might
as
well
come
to
a
head
now
as
or
next
week
at
that
moment
pansy
remembered
the
man
who
had
held
her
with
such
fierce
strength
and
passion
in
the
garden
of
the
villa
and
she
wondered
not
without
a
touch
of
alarm
how
he
would
take
her
refusal
she
got
up
and
went
to
his
side
i
must
give
you
something
else
to
do
than
just
watching
me
it
makes
me
nervous
she
said
from
a
box
on
a
table
near
she
took
a
cigarette
and
placed
it
between
his
lips
then
she
struck
a
match
and
held
it
towards
him
in
a
lazy
contented
manner
he
let
her
do
it
but
when
the
cigarette
was
lighted
he
did
not
give
her
time
to
draw
her
hand
away
he
caught
her
wrist
and
drawing
her
hand
a
little
closer
blew
out
the
match
when
this
was
done
he
did
not
let
her
hand
go
instead
he
took
one
or
two
puffs
at
the
cigarette
all
the
time
watching
her
closely
i
did
give
you
my
hand
keeps
she
said
i
want
it
back
again
please
it
was
hint
enough
for
any
man
but
le
breton
did
not
take
it
in
a
deliberate
manner
and
with
her
still
a
prisoner
he
got
to
his
feet
and
put
the
cigarette
on
the
table
pansy
did
not
try
to
free
herself
the
situation
had
to
be
faced
when
the
cigarette
was
laid
down
he
took
the
other
delicate
wrist
into
his
keeping
then
he
drew
the
girl
right
up
to
him
until
her
hands
were
resting
on
his
chest
pansy
suppose
i
ask
you
to
redeem
your
promise
he
said
oh
no
i
could
she
answered
a
trifle
breathlessly
why
not
i
exactly
the
same
man
now
that
i
was
when
you
promised
to
marry
me
a
much
better
man
if
you
only
knew
it
thanks
to
meeting
you
i
did
know
anything
about
you
then
but
you
knew
you
loved
me
i
do
now
raoul
she
said
does
the
fact
of
my
arab
blood
make
marriage
between
us
impossible
there
was
no
reply
in
her
silence
le
breton
read
his
answer
his
hands
tightened
on
her
wrists
and
a
baulked
look
crossed
his
face
so
the
black
barrier
was
one
that
neither
love
nor
gratitude
would
make
her
cross
willingly
there
were
some
bitter
moments
for
him
as
he
realised
this
for
all
his
wealth
and
power
for
all
his
scheming
despite
the
fact
that
pansy
confessed
to
loving
him
she
refused
to
be
his
wife
it
seemed
that
nothing
he
could
do
would
bring
her
into
his
arms
in
the
willing
way
he
wanted
pansy
was
the
first
to
speak
in
that
crushing
grip
on
her
wrists
she
read
an
agony
of
pain
and
disappointment
that
her
one
desire
now
was
to
soothe
it
not
you
raoul
it
the
idea
she
said
in
a
low
voice
so
the
idea
of
marrying
me
is
repugnant
and
yet
you
love
me
she
nodded
loosing
her
wrists
he
turned
to
the
table
and
took
another
cigarette
this
however
he
lighted
for
himself
pansy
watched
him
marvelling
at
the
cool
way
he
had
taken
her
refusal
considering
the
fire
and
temper
in
the
man
and
his
air
of
never
having
been
thwarted
in
any
way
it
was
hardly
what
she
had
expected
she
put
it
down
to
the
fact
that
she
was
completely
at
his
mercy
alone
and
helpless
in
this
barbaric
city
her
heart
ached
at
the
thought
that
through
no
fault
of
his
own
she
could
only
give
him
pain
in
return
for
all
his
kindness
going
to
his
side
she
laid
a
slim
hand
on
his
sleeve
raoul
i
hope
you
know
you
awful
nice
about
things
she
said
he
glanced
at
her
at
the
beautiful
eyes
raised
to
his
with
infinite
gentleness
in
their
velvety
depths
and
he
laughed
am
i
he
said
then
he
laughed
again
and
his
mirth
was
a
mingling
of
bitterness
and
savagery

saw
nothing
of
her
host
until
the
following
afternoon
almost
immediately
after
his
declaration
le
breton
left
her
most
of
his
time
had
been
spent
in
contemplating
the
truth
now
before
him
his
scheming
had
failed
a
sense
of
gratitude
had
not
made
the
girl
forget
his
colour
after
a
sleepless
night
he
was
up
and
away
riding
madly
along
one
of
the
sandy
tracks
that
served
his
kingdom
as
roads
in
a
vain
endeavour
to
escape
from
his
chagrin
and
disappointment
and
trying
to
decide
on
his
next
move
he
was
surprised
at
his
own
hesitation
having
failed
to
attain
his
object
he
was
astonished
that
he
should
pause
before
doing
what
was
obviously
the
only
course
left
open
to
him
just
take
the
girl
whether
she
liked
it
or
not
but
he
knew
why
he
hesitated
pansy
loved
him
in
her
own
way
as
she
might
love
a
man
of
her
own
nationality
if
he
took
her
in
his
fashion
that
love
might
be
swept
from
him
and
the
idea
was
one
that
he
could
not
bear
to
contemplate
he
returned
from
his
wild
ride
still
undecided
on
the
next
move
in
this
frame
of
mind
he
came
upon
pansy
in
the
midst
of
a
solitary
afternoon
tea
set
in
a
shady
corner
of
the
tennis
court
she
greeted
him
as
if
the
episode
of
the
previous
afternoon
had
never
been
what
have
you
been
doing
with
yourself
all
day
she
asked
as
she
handed
him
a
cup
of
tea
i
been
trying
to
ride
off
my
disappointment
he
replied
pansy
too
had
been
fighting
a
battle
of
her
own
most
of
her
night
had
been
spent
in
arguing
with
temptation
she
was
rich
and
independent
why
should
she
marry
the
man
she
loved
even
if
it
were
going
against
all
the
canons
of
her
society
she
was
wealthy
enough
to
defy
society
she
owed
more
than
her
life
to
him
gratitude
as
well
as
love
urged
her
towards
him
why
should
she
make
him
suffer
through
no
fault
of
his
own
why
should
she
suffer
herself
why
should
she
shut
herself
up
from
the
man
she
loved
because
he
happened
to
be
a
a
a
nigger
the
echo
of
dennis
voice
shouted
the
word
at
her
as
it
had
seemed
to
shout
that
night
in
the
london
hotel
when
le
breton
name
had
been
mentioned
pansy
looked
at
her
host
as
he
lolled
beside
her
a
picture
of
strength
and
handsomeness
she
wished
his
dark
blood
were
more
in
evidence
that
he
did
not
look
exactly
like
some
of
the
big
french
spanish
and
italian
men
she
had
seen
occasionally
in
various
places
on
the
continent
so
absolutely
european
was
he
that
it
was
impossible
to
think
he
was
i
wish
you
were
so
nice
and
handsome
raoul
she
said
impulsively
he
cast
a
quick
speculative
glance
at
her
perhaps
after
all
a
little
more
patience
was
all
that
was
needed
patience
combined
with
his
own
presence
when
tea
was
over
pansy
got
up
in
a
restless
way
i
feel
i
must
do
something
active
or
else
go
mad
she
remarked
the
feeling
was
one
he
could
sympathise
with
we
have
a
game
of
tennis
then
if
you
promise
to
go
easy
pansy
remembered
the
way
he
had
played
that
afternoon
in
grand
canary
you
simply
mop
the
floor
with
me
she
said
i
play
you
only
too
anxious
to
get
away
from
her
own
thoughts
and
the
temptation
they
brought
pansy
turned
towards
the
court
when
the
game
started
he
handled
his
opponent
carefully
putting
the
balls
where
she
could
get
them
without
any
effort
at
the
end
of
the
first
set
pansy
objected
to
his
methods
you
not
really
trying
you
only
playing
with
me
she
said
it
would
be
fair
for
me
to
pit
all
my
strength
against
yours
would
it
now
he
asked
well
do
make
a
game
of
it
if
you
go
on
like
this
i
could
sit
down
comfortably
in
the
middle
of
the
court
and
win
you
need
put
the
balls
on
my
racket
i
can
stretch
an
inch
or
so
around
without
fatal
results
the
next
game
was
more
strenuous
but
as
it
went
on
pansy
getting
excited
forgot
caution
a
long
stretch
and
an
upward
spring
to
intercept
one
of
her
opponent
balls
brought
cutting
pains
tearing
at
her
chest
the
racket
dropped
from
her
grip
she
stood
white
and
swaying
her
hand
on
her
heart
in
a
moment
he
had
vaulted
the
net
and
was
at
her
side
his
arm
about
her
concern
on
his
face
it
nothing
she
gasped
it
that
accursed
bullet
he
said
when
edouard
extracted
it
he
warned
me
you
feel
the
effects
for
some
time
he
spoke
without
thinking
the
sight
of
her
suffering
making
him
forget
his
double
rôle
at
the
moment
pansy
was
too
full
of
pain
to
grasp
what
he
had
said
half
leading
half
carrying
her
he
took
her
to
the
nearest
chair
settling
her
there
with
a
cushion
at
her
head
with
white
lips
she
smiled
at
him
her
only
desire
to
allay
his
concern
there
nothing
to
worry
about
she
said
faintly
i
a
long
way
from
being
dead
it
all
my
fault
he
said
hoarsely
oh
no
you
always
said
i
must
be
too
strenuous
she
contradicted
le
breton
let
it
stay
at
that
aware
that
he
had
said
more
than
he
intended
to
say
and
hoping
the
girl
had
not
grasped
all
that
lay
within
his
comment
for
some
minutes
pansy
sat
quiet
and
as
her
pain
receded
her
companion
sentence
came
more
to
the
fore
it
that
accursed
bullet
when
edouard
extracted
it
he
warned
me
you
feel
the
effects
for
some
time
from
alice
pansy
had
learnt
that
the
bullet
had
been
extracted
on
the
day
she
was
brought
into
her
enemy
camp
then
raoul
must
have
been
there
with
the
sultan
forces
but
why
had
he
told
her
why
had
he
pretended
that
he
only
had
she
was
the
girl
captured
why
had
he
never
mentioned
edouard
before
why
had
edouard
never
mentioned
him
it
looked
as
if
he
had
not
wanted
her
to
know
but
why
had
he
wanted
her
to
know
as
pansy
pondered
on
the
problem
mingled
with
the
sweetness
of
the
roses
came
another
scent
she
knew
one
that
had
greeted
her
every
morning
during
her
stay
in
the
palace
above
the
screening
trellis
of
roses
a
tree
grew
covered
with
great
bunches
of
pink
flowers
like
apple
blossom
but
more
vivid
filling
the
air
with
fragrance
pansy
had
seen
the
flower
before
among
the
blossoms
that
used
to
come
to
her
every
morning
in
the
dim
gilded
chamber
still
only
a
few
flowers
pansy
le
breton
remark
in
the
orange
groves
at
telde
suddenly
flashed
across
her
mind
she
remembered
also
his
array
of
arab
servants
how
obsequious
they
had
been
to
their
master
on
that
occasion
and
his
wealth
and
magnificence
a
splendour
that
was
almost
regal
close
to
where
she
sat
the
stood
among
the
assortment
of
cakes
were
one
or
two
of
a
kind
she
had
seen
previous
to
her
rescue
tiny
dainties
made
from
layers
of
sponge
cake
and
marzipan
with
chocolate
icing
on
the
top
often
in
those
long
hopeless
days
in
the
gilded
prison
a
similar
morsel
was
all
she
had
been
able
to
eat
for
her
tea
sixteen
years
ago
a
boy
of
about
fourteen
had
sworn
to
kill
her
father
he
would
be
thirty
now
the
same
age
as
and
the
sultan
spoke
french
too
they
were
little
things
but
they
all
pointed
in
one
and
the
same
direction
and
as
pansy
brooded
on
them
an
incredulous
expression
came
to
her
eyes
and
with
it
a
look
as
if
she
were
fighting
to
keep
some
horrible
impossible
truth
at
bay
her
gaze
went
to
le
breton
a
great
big
fine
man
awful
alice
description
of
the
sultan
casim
ammeh
came
back
to
her
words
that
fitted
her
host
exactly
as
she
looked
at
him
from
the
paddock
came
the
stamp
of
a
horse
hoof
she
was
here
her
favourite
horse
was
here
raoul
le
breton
was
here
all
of
them
in
this
desert
city
hundreds
of
miles
from
civilisation
such
a
combination
could
not
be
unless
if
i
were
a
king
in
babylon
and
you
were
a
christian
slave
or
to
get
down
to
more
modern
times
if
i
were
a
barbaric
sultan
somewhere
in
africa
and
you
a
girl
i
fancied
and
caught
and
carried
off
his
own
words
came
echoing
through
her
head
condemning
words
then
she
recollected
with
what
unpleasant
emphasis
he
had
said
au
revoir
on
parting
with
her
that
night
on
her
yacht
all
at
once
pansy
miracle
exploded
she
wondered
how
she
could
have
been
such
a
fool
as
not
to
have
guessed
sooner
this
was
the
sultan
casim
ammeh
this
man
standing
before
her
he
caught
her
gaze
and
smiled
it
seemed
to
the
girl
mockingly
well
heart
ease
are
you
feeling
better
he
asked
after
this
you
agree
with
me
that
light
of
the
harem
act
is
the
most
suitable
life
for
you
just
at
present
it
seemed
to
pansy
that
he
was
gibing
at
her
trust
her
belief
her
incredulous
folly
what
a
blind
fool
she
had
been
it
was
all
as
plain
as
daylight
now
raoul
le
breton
was
the
sultan
casim
ammeh
it
was
her
father
enemy
she
had
confessed
to
loving
had
wept
in
front
of
clung
to
trusted
displaying
a
weakness
that
had
fallen
to
no
man
lot
save
her
father
at
the
thought
pansy
soul
writhed
within
her
how
could
she
have
been
such
a
fool
how
he
must
have
laughed
at
her
raoul
le
breton
had
condemned
her
to
the
unspeakable
ordeal
of
the
slave
market
in
order
to
torture
her
father
he
had
done
it
raoul
le
breton
the
man
she
loved
pansy
did
not
love
him
now
she
hated
him
for
a
moment
she
was
too
stunned
by
her
discovery
to
say
or
do
anything
then
she
said
in
a
voice
that
wild
anger
stifled
somewhat
so
are
the
sultan
casim
ammeh
as
pansy
spoke
she
got
to
her
feet
her
eyes
blazing
there
was
no
mistaking
what
was
on
her
face
she
had
guessed
the
truth
on
realising
this
he
made
no
attempt
at
further
deception
am
the
sultan
casim
ammeh
he
said
smiling
and
my
little
slave
are
my
most
cherished
possession
more
to
me
than
my
kingdom
his
cool
confession
staggered
her
as
he
stood
there
unabashed
and
unrepentant
she
looked
round
quickly
in
search
of
something
to
strike
him
with
for
the
knowledge
of
his
deceit
and
duplicity
had
made
her
beside
herself
with
rage
since
there
was
no
weapon
at
hand
she
set
off
rapidly
across
the
lawn
heedless
of
where
she
went
her
only
desire
to
get
away
from
him
she
had
not
gone
very
far
however
before
he
was
at
her
side
where
are
you
going
pansy
he
asked
with
a
masterful
air
that
he
should
dare
to
follow
her
dare
to
call
her
by
her
name
enraged
her
beyond
all
bounds
and
his
words
added
to
her
fury
they
made
her
realise
there
was
nowhere
she
could
go
to
escape
him
like
a
whirlwind
she
turned
upon
him
i
wish
i
wish
i
could
kill
you
she
gasped
there
was
a
tennis
racket
lying
at
her
feet
as
if
to
carry
out
this
design
she
stooped
and
picked
it
up
her
only
desire
now
to
send
it
crashing
into
the
mocking
masterful
face
but
he
guessed
her
intention
in
a
moment
he
had
grasped
the
racket
and
wrested
it
away
no
pansy
he
said
no
one
has
ever
struck
me
and
you
not
going
to
for
i
do
quite
know
what
the
consequences
might
be
there
was
a
brief
tense
silence
as
he
looked
at
the
girl
it
seemed
that
fate
had
decided
the
next
move
for
him
we
may
as
well
come
to
an
understanding
he
went
on
i
hate
your
father
but
i
love
you
and
you
got
to
have
me
whether
you
like
it
or
not
i
prefer
to
marry
you
in
your
english
way
but
if
you
consent
to
that
then
i
shall
take
you
in
mine
the
choice
is
with
you
there
was
only
one
part
of
his
ultimatum
that
pansy
thoroughly
grasped
and
there
seemed
no
limit
to
his
audacity
i
rather
die
than
marry
you
she
flamed
for
i
hate
you
do
you
hear
i
hate
you
more
than
anything
on
this
earth
he
heard
right
enough
and
his
face
blanched
at
her
words
then
before
he
had
recovered
from
this
blow
pansy
struck
him
across
the
mouth
with
all
her
strength
bringing
blood
to
the
lips
that
dared
to
talk
of
love
to
chapter
xix
there
was
a
new
slave
in
the
sultan
harem
a
dazed
girl
who
looked
as
if
she
moved
in
dreams
she
was
not
reclining
on
a
lounge
or
cushions
as
the
other
girls
around
the
fountain
were
she
half
sat
half
knelt
upon
her
cushions
her
slim
bare
legs
beneath
her
her
hands
lying
listlessly
on
her
knee
staring
straight
ahead
as
if
in
a
trance
since
that
episode
on
the
tennis
court
pansy
felt
as
if
she
were
living
in
the
midst
of
some
wild
story
in
which
raoul
le
breton
and
the
sultan
casim
ammeh
had
got
mixed
the
sultan
wanted
to
marry
her
and
she
had
refused
then
then
infuriated
with
the
sense
of
her
own
helplessness
and
his
complete
power
she
had
struck
him
she
could
see
him
now
with
the
blood
oozing
on
his
lips
his
face
white
with
rage
his
eyes
flaming
looking
as
if
he
could
kill
her
and
she
had
wished
he
would
then
there
would
have
been
an
end
of
it
all
she
would
have
done
with
him
herself
her
own
folly
and
the
hatred
that
raged
like
a
fire
within
her
but
he
had
not
touched
her
white
with
passion
he
had
just
stood
and
looked
at
her
and
she
had
looked
back
waiting
for
the
end
that
had
not
come
instead
three
women
had
come
and
she
had
been
taken
out
of
his
presence
through
the
big
and
along
dim
passages
past
jewelled
guards
and
into
a
little
room
with
an
ottoman
and
cushions
and
a
tiny
window
all
fretted
like
lace
impossible
to
get
out
of
then
the
women
had
undressed
her
they
were
three
to
one
it
was
useless
to
struggle
dignity
seemed
all
that
was
left
to
her
there
was
not
much
of
that
even
when
the
women
had
done
with
her
they
put
her
into
a
white
silk
slip
that
reached
only
to
her
knees
and
with
nothing
more
than
a
strap
of
pearls
on
either
shoulder
they
would
have
heaped
more
pearls
upon
her
string
upon
string
about
her
neck
but
she
would
not
have
that
she
tore
them
off
so
angrily
that
the
slender
threads
snapped
and
they
fell
like
frozen
tears
upon
the
marble
floor
as
her
amber
beads
had
fallen
that
night
in
his
villa
what
a
minor
thing
lucille
lemesurier
was
now
forgivable
when
she
had
learnt
his
race
and
religion
not
like
this
gigantic
deception
a
deception
that
had
forced
her
into
saying
she
loved
the
sultan
casim
ammeh
the
man
who
had
tortured
her
father
leaving
the
women
grovelling
after
the
scattered
pearls
pansy
had
rushed
from
the
room
her
only
desire
to
seek
some
way
of
escape
she
had
gone
in
her
short
slip
and
short
curls
looking
like
some
lovely
rebellious
child
her
steps
had
taken
her
into
a
big
room
like
a
hall
where
a
crowd
of
women
were
gathered
half
a
dozen
of
them
girls
dressed
in
a
similar
style
to
herself
then
pansy
strength
went
from
her
suddenly
she
realized
where
she
was
in
the
sultan
harem
and
she
knew
there
would
be
no
escape
sara
had
come
to
her
and
had
led
her
towards
a
pile
of
cushions
set
by
a
fountain
where
the
other
girls
were
and
the
woman
had
said
sharp
words
to
the
assembly
who
had
risen
as
if
to
crowd
around
her
words
that
had
kept
them
at
bay
when
she
was
seated
they
had
stayed
looking
at
her
most
of
them
with
curiosity
and
friendliness
but
there
was
one
face
that
pansy
for
all
her
numbness
saw
was
hostile
the
face
of
a
beautiful
girl
there
was
one
girl
too
who
was
more
than
specially
friendly
who
said
to
her
in
a
soft
cooing
voice
where
do
you
come
from
sister
for
your
skin
is
whiter
than
mine
pansy
did
not
answer
leonora
question
she
was
wondering
herself
where
she
came
from
from
another
world
it
seemed
it
was
incredible
that
she
pansy
langham
could
be
a
slave
in
a
sultan
harem
garbed
as
these
other
slave
girls
were
incredible
that
only
that
afternoon
she
had
been
playing
tennis
with
raoul
le
breton
as
she
might
have
played
with
any
man
in
her
own
place
in
england
what
ages
ago
it
was
yet
perhaps
it
was
only
an
hour
like
a
beautiful
dream
that
had
vanished
there
was
no
raoul
le
breton
no
big
masterful
man
whom
she
had
had
to
love
in
spite
of
everything
there
was
only
this
barbaric
sultan
who
hated
her
father
who
because
she
refused
to
marry
him
had
sent
her
to
this
strange
room
his
harem
and
she
was
his
slave
she
pansy
langham
who
had
never
obeyed
any
will
except
her
own
her
hands
clenched
how
she
hated
him
he
was
so
supremely
master
any
moment
he
might
come
to
pick
whichever
of
his
slaves
he
fancied
and
he
might
pick
her
the
ignominy
of
it
just
to
be
a
man
chattel
and
hitherto
all
men
had
been
abject
and
willing
slaves
heedless
alike
of
leonora
cooing
advances
and
rayma
dark
scowls
pansy
sat
down
the
shadows
gathered
the
lamps
were
lit
then
dinner
time
came
a
conglomeration
of
sweets
and
fruit
and
dainties
set
out
on
silver
trays
with
only
a
spoon
to
eat
with
again
leonora
voice
broke
into
pansy
broodings
come
wo
you
eat
my
sister
she
coaxed
pushing
one
of
the
trays
closer
but
pansy
felt
as
if
she
could
never
eat
a
bite
again
rayma
ate
nothing
either
with
angry
eyes
she
studied
the
newcomer
pansy
was
very
beautiful
in
her
way
but
no
more
beautiful
than
rayma
was
in
hers
and
what
was
more
she
was
not
perfect
there
was
an
ugly
red
scar
on
one
of
her
arms
and
the
lord
casim
hated
flaw
or
blemish
on
a
woman
would
this
new
slave
presence
bring
him
to
the
harem
if
he
came
rayma
clenched
her
little
white
teeth
then
there
would
be
a
battle
royal
between
this
white
girl
and
herself
for
his
favors
but
she
would
not
let
his
heart
go
lightly
stretched
full
length
on
her
couch
her
elbows
on
the
soft
cushions
her
pointed
chin
in
the
cup
of
her
hands
the
arab
girl
lay
watching
her
rival
and
waiting
the
evening
wore
on
the
lamps
burnt
low
and
started
to
flare
and
crackle
without
any
sign
of
the
sultan
coming
presently
shriek
after
shriek
echoing
through
the
vaulted
hall
roused
pansy
from
her
broodings
making
her
look
round
in
a
quick
startled
manner
the
shrieks
were
familiar
muffled
they
had
reached
her
every
evening
in
that
dim
gilded
chamber
it
only
rayma
leonora
said
indifferently
she
has
hysterics
every
night
because
the
sultan
does
not
come
he
has
not
been
to
the
harem
now
for
three
months
or
longer
not
since
he
left
the
city
on
some
foray
she
fears
some
other
girl
has
stolen
his
heart
from
her
leonora
paused
her
great
eyes
on
the
is
it
you
my
sister
she
finished
inquisitively
for
if
so
i
shall
love
you
but
pansy
had
nothing
to
say
at
that
moment
she
was
wondering
why
rayma
shrieked
because
the
sultan
had
not
come
there
seemed
to
her
more
reason
to
shriek
if
he
did
come
chapter
xx
on
one
of
the
terraces
of
his
palace
the
sultan
sat
and
brooded
his
face
hard
and
savage
as
he
glowered
at
the
scene
ahead
of
him
a
harmless
scene
where
night
shadows
settled
on
a
scented
garden
with
the
glint
of
a
lake
beyond
never
in
his
life
had
such
an
indignity
been
put
upon
him
never
had
anyone
dared
dispute
his
right
to
do
what
he
pleased
never
until
this
english
girl
had
come
into
his
life
and
she
had
struck
him
the
sultan
as
if
he
were
some
erring
menial
whose
ways
had
annoyed
her
under
the
recollection
the
man
untamed
soul
writhed
she
had
done
as
she
liked
all
her
life
all
that
money
of
hers
had
given
her
ideas
no
woman
ought
to
have
now
she
had
to
learn
that
he
was
her
master
she
was
in
the
harem
now
and
there
she
could
stay
a
spell
there
would
cool
her
temper
and
make
her
more
amenable
to
his
wishes
the
trees
in
the
garden
sighed
faintly
the
soft
wind
brought
the
scent
of
roses
and
the
splash
of
a
fountain
his
mind
went
back
to
another
garden
in
grand
canary
the
echoes
of
a
girl
voice
whispered
put
your
ear
quite
close
it
not
a
matter
that
can
be
shouted
from
the
she
had
shouted
loud
enough
that
she
hated
him
she
had
not
whispered
that
fact
a
spasm
of
pain
crossed
his
face
why
did
she
fight
against
him
this
slender
lovely
helpless
girl
whom
he
could
break
with
one
hand
she
fought
bravely
with
all
the
odds
against
her
and
she
had
dared
to
do
what
no
one
else
in
the
place
dared
do
what
no
one
had
ever
done
in
the
whole
of
his
wild
unbridled
life
she
had
dared
to
strike
him
fair
and
square
with
all
her
strength
across
the
mouth
then
suddenly
his
anger
melted
a
smile
came
and
played
about
his
scarred
lips
surely
no
man
could
be
angry
for
long
with
a
girl
so
brave
and
helpless
he
deserved
it
for
his
deception
just
as
he
had
deserved
her
scorn
and
contempt
over
lucille
she
was
always
giving
him
what
he
deserved
this
little
english
flower
of
his
more
than
he
deserved
a
struggling
conscience
breathed
for
he
had
never
deserved
those
three
words
she
had
once
whispered
in
his
ear
i
love
you
chapter
xxi
all
the
following
day
rayma
waited
for
the
sultan
coming
pansy
waited
also
by
now
she
realised
more
fully
what
she
had
done
struck
and
infuriated
the
man
who
held
her
father
life
in
his
hand
however
nothing
was
seen
of
the
sultan
either
that
day
or
the
next
for
pansy
the
days
were
the
longest
she
had
ever
spent
in
her
life
she
could
not
doze
away
her
time
as
the
other
girls
did
with
coffee
and
sherbet
and
cigarettes
their
greatest
exertion
a
bath
or
making
sweetmeats
over
a
charcoal
brazier
or
doing
intricate
embroidery
she
kept
out
of
their
way
as
much
as
possible
in
her
own
room
or
wandering
aimlessly
in
the
garden
looking
at
walls
impossible
for
her
to
scale
wondering
what
had
happened
to
her
father
and
her
friends
and
what
would
happen
to
herself
but
even
the
garden
was
barred
to
her
except
in
the
very
early
morning
and
the
brief
space
after
sunset
if
she
tried
to
go
at
other
times
there
were
twenty
women
to
stop
her
the
order
was
the
sultan
she
was
told
lest
to
escape
him
she
should
wander
in
the
tropic
heat
and
make
herself
all
her
meals
had
to
be
taken
in
the
harem
and
for
bathing
there
was
only
the
harem
bathroom
that
was
a
vast
underground
tank
approached
by
marble
steps
cool
and
still
and
dim
its
silence
only
broken
by
the
dip
of
water
there
the
girls
disported
themselves
several
times
a
day
but
pansy
was
not
used
to
company
when
she
bathed
and
to
avoid
them
she
rose
very
early
when
she
was
sure
of
having
the
great
marble
tank
to
herself
during
the
afternoon
of
the
third
day
the
sultan
came
pansy
was
not
in
the
harem
at
the
time
but
lying
on
the
lounge
in
her
own
room
sara
entrance
roused
her
my
pearl
the
sultan
is
here
she
said
cajolingly
and
he
desires
to
see
you
i
prefer
to
stay
where
i
am
was
the
cold
response
the
woman
looked
at
her
speculating
on
the
relations
between
this
girl
and
the
sultan
they
had
once
been
so
fond
of
one
another
always
together
and
now
the
girl
had
been
sent
to
the
harem
and
for
three
days
the
sultan
had
not
come
near
her
it
useless
to
resist
my
pearl
sara
explained
if
you
do
come
when
the
sultan
commands
servants
will
be
sent
to
fetch
you
pansy
had
no
wish
to
be
dragged
into
her
captor
presence
since
she
had
to
go
she
might
as
well
go
with
dignity
however
she
did
not
go
very
far
only
just
beyond
the
door
of
her
own
quarters
once
there
she
sank
down
quickly
on
a
pile
of
cushions
in
her
usual
position
half
sitting
half
kneeling
a
position
that
made
the
scantiness
of
her
garment
not
quite
so
obvious
at
once
she
knew
who
the
man
in
the
white
burnoose
was
although
she
had
never
seen
him
in
anything
but
civilised
attire
before
he
was
sitting
on
an
ottoman
near
the
fountain
with
the
girls
clustered
around
him
fawning
on
him
like
dogs
round
a
loved
master
pansy
turned
a
slender
disdainful
shoulder
on
the
scene
but
if
she
did
not
look
in
the
direction
of
the
group
there
was
one
at
least
who
kept
a
sharp
suspicious
eye
on
her
by
the
sultan
side
rayma
sat
with
her
pointed
chin
resting
upon
his
knee
why
have
you
come
sooner
to
see
that
new
slave
of
yours
casim
beloved
she
asked
pointing
a
slim
finger
at
the
distant
girl
i
had
other
things
than
women
to
think
about
he
replied
evasively
a
bitter
reminiscent
smile
curved
his
lips
as
he
spoke
some
words
of
pansy
were
in
his
mind
so
long
as
it
it
all
right
the
trouble
starts
when
it
comes
to
certainly
for
him
the
trouble
had
started
when
it
came
to
woman
when
this
slender
wayward
girl
came
into
his
life
for
she
had
robbed
all
other
women
of
their
sweetness
with
longing
his
gaze
rested
on
pansy
what
a
fool
he
was
not
to
take
to
let
her
whim
come
between
himself
and
his
desires
but
there
was
something
more
than
a
girl
whim
had
he
but
realised
it
a
feeble
new
self
that
pansy
was
responsible
for
the
man
he
might
have
been
but
for
his
profligate
training
rayma
saw
where
his
gaze
was
to
get
his
eyes
away
from
pansy
she
took
one
of
his
hands
and
pressed
it
on
her
bosom
when
first
i
came
here
my
lord
she
whispered
there
was
nothing
else
you
could
think
of
his
attention
came
back
to
her
you
were
very
pretty
rayma
he
said
a
trifle
absently
and
am
i
not
beautiful
still
she
asked
quickly
you
always
a
picture
he
answered
he
talked
as
if
to
a
spoilt
child
who
bored
him
rayma
hitched
herself
closer
until
her
soft
breast
pressed
against
his
knee
but
he
remained
silent
without
look
or
caress
his
gaze
still
on
the
distant
girl
he
was
wondering
whether
he
would
take
pansy
out
of
her
present
surroundings
or
if
a
spell
in
the
harem
might
not
make
her
realise
to
the
fullest
her
own
helplessness
and
his
complete
supremacy
leonora
watched
her
master
her
dark
eyes
full
of
joy
and
malice
there
are
some
people
who
never
know
when
they
not
wanted
she
remarked
and
to
no
one
in
particular
rayma
cast
a
venomous
look
at
her
but
leonora
only
smiled
at
her
glances
can
she
dance
this
new
slave
of
yours
the
arab
girl
asked
suddenly
she
dances
very
nicely
he
answered
in
an
indifferent
manner
as
well
as
i
do
she
asked
jealously
he
thought
of
the
writhing
rayma
called
dancing
she
dances
quite
differently
from
you
let
us
both
dance
before
you
then
so
that
you
may
judge
which
is
the
better
of
us
she
said
quickly
illustration
let
us
both
dance
for
you
so
that
you
may
judge
between
us
however
he
vetoed
this
neat
arrangement
the
girl
has
been
wounded
and
she
still
not
strong
enough
for
much
exertion
rayma
brooded
on
this
fact
and
the
more
she
thought
about
it
the
less
she
liked
it
did
you
capture
her
on
that
foray
she
asked
presently
she
was
part
of
my
booty
he
said
a
lingering
tenderness
in
his
voice
again
rayma
was
silent
very
quickly
she
put
two
and
two
together
the
sultan
had
not
been
near
the
harem
since
his
return
from
that
quest
for
vengeance
and
this
new
slave
had
been
captured
during
that
foray
so
this
was
the
girl
who
had
stolen
the
sultan
heart
who
had
kept
him
away
from
the
harem
all
these
dreary
weeks
the
girl
sitting
there
by
the
distant
doorway
the
girl
who
would
not
come
near
him
whom
he
watched
yet
did
not
go
to
rayma
scowled
at
pansy
back
then
she
turned
to
one
of
the
women
attendants
sitting
near
fetch
that
girl
to
me
she
said
pointing
to
pansy
the
woman
rose
ready
and
anxious
to
do
a
favourite
bidding
but
the
sultan
motioned
her
down
again
she
comes
at
no
one
bidding
except
mine
he
said
firmly
pouting
rayma
wriggled
closer
to
him
may
not
even
call
her
she
asked
softly
the
rule
applies
to
all
here
he
replied
somewhat
impatiently
he
pushed
rayma
aside
then
he
got
to
his
feet
and
went
towards
pansy
his
step
behind
her
made
the
girl
heart
start
beating
violently
he
was
coming
to
issue
some
further
ultimatum
perhaps
not
an
ultimatum
even
but
an
order
pansy
had
wanted
to
see
her
captor
to
plead
for
her
father
now
that
he
was
there
the
words
refused
to
pass
her
lips
to
have
asked
any
favour
of
him
would
have
choked
her
well
pansy
are
you
going
to
marry
me
he
asked
he
might
not
have
been
there
for
all
the
notice
she
took
of
him
come
he
went
on
in
an
authoritative
manner
you
must
realise
that
i
supreme
and
that
you
must
obey
me
pansy
realised
this
to
the
fullest
and
the
sense
of
her
own
helplessness
only
infuriated
her
since
she
had
no
weapon
she
could
turn
on
him
except
her
tongue
she
hit
at
him
with
that
and
she
hit
her
very
hardest
on
the
spot
she
knew
would
hurt
the
most
english
women
do
marry
niggers
she
said
contemptuously
the
word
cut
deep
into
his
proud
spirit
all
the
deeper
for
coming
from
her
lips
although
he
whitened
under
the
insult
the
knowledge
of
his
own
complete
supremacy
held
his
fiery
temper
in
check
the
marrying
is
just
as
you
like
he
replied
forms
and
ceremonies
are
nothing
to
me
but
i
an
idea
you
preferred
them
there
was
a
brief
silence
with
her
face
turned
away
pansy
sat
ignoring
him
entirely
leaving
him
only
a
slender
white
neck
a
small
ear
and
part
of
a
cheek
to
study
and
the
sultan
studied
them
amused
that
anything
so
helpless
should
dare
to
defy
him
you
not
only
yourself
to
consider
when
you
set
me
at
defiance
in
this
manner
he
remarked
presently
there
your
father
and
your
english
friends
his
words
brought
pansy
eyes
to
him
fear
in
their
velvety
depths
at
her
look
he
laughed
your
kind
heart
has
given
me
some
hostages
pansy
he
said
but
nothing
will
happen
to
them
for
another
week
i
give
you
that
much
time
to
make
up
your
mind
not
longer
for
my
patience
is
wearing
very
thin
and
i
had
a
lot
where
you
concerned
more
than
i
ever
dreamt
i
was
capable
of
in
the
meantime
my
little
girl
try
and
remember
i
not
quite
the
hopeless
villain
you
think
me
or
you
would
have
liked
me
even
for
a
day
but
just
then
it
seemed
to
pansy
there
was
no
greater
villain
on
earth
than
the
sultan
casim
ammeh
chapter
xxii
early
the
next
morning
when
pansy
was
splashing
about
in
the
great
underground
tank
a
voice
made
her
look
up
in
a
startled
fashion
so
far
no
one
had
intruded
on
her
ablutions
it
was
a
soft
purring
malicious
little
voice
that
said
in
lisping
french
now
i
see
why
you
always
come
here
early
why
you
do
bathe
with
me
and
the
other
girls
on
the
broad
marble
steps
rayma
stood
looking
down
at
her
rival
spitefully
i
come
early
because
i
not
used
to
bathing
before
people
pansy
replied
hoping
the
other
would
take
the
hint
and
go
but
rayma
did
not
go
she
seated
herself
on
the
steps
and
stayed
there
her
black
eyes
fixed
on
the
graceful
girl
in
the
water
has
the
sultan
seen
those
scars
she
asked
pointing
a
slim
disparaging
finger
at
the
network
of
red
marks
and
ridges
on
thigh
and
side
pansy
flushed
at
the
question
of
course
not
she
cried
indignantly
when
he
bought
me
i
stood
before
him
with
only
my
hair
for
a
covering
and
i
stood
gladly
for
i
knew
i
was
perfect
rayma
finished
as
if
the
fact
gave
her
pleasure
pansy
had
no
desire
to
discuss
the
sultan
likes
and
dislikes
to
avoid
further
conversation
she
swam
out
to
the
far
end
of
the
great
bath
and
stayed
there
until
rayma
had
gone
all
that
day
whenever
the
arab
girl
eyes
met
hers
there
was
a
look
of
malicious
triumph
in
them
and
when
the
two
girls
came
within
speaking
distance
that
purring
little
voice
whispered
spitefully
only
wait
until
the
sultan
comes
i
shall
find
a
way
of
taking
his
love
from
you
despondently
pansy
wished
this
would
come
to
pass
she
was
between
the
upper
and
nether
millstones
her
father
on
one
side
her
captor
on
the
other
several
days
passed
without
anything
being
seen
of
the
sultan
then
one
night
he
came
when
the
girls
were
gathered
in
the
harem
drinking
coffee
and
smoking
cigarettes
after
dinner
pansy
was
in
the
group
and
the
sight
of
his
big
figure
brought
her
to
her
feet
sharply
with
a
feeling
of
choking
alarm
then
she
stayed
where
she
was
fully
aware
that
escape
was
impossible
he
seated
himself
at
her
side
she
would
have
edged
away
but
his
voice
stopped
her
no
pansy
stay
where
you
are
he
said
quickly
and
since
i
smoke
bubbles
like
the
men
in
pictures
and
on
lids
you
once
mentioned
you
can
give
me
a
cigarette
and
light
it
if
you
like
he
added
with
a
touch
of
teasing
pansy
did
not
like
she
stood
slim
and
straight
and
defiant
ignoring
his
request
conscious
that
all
eyes
were
upon
them
all
ears
listening
to
what
was
said
since
she
refused
to
do
the
sultan
bidding
and
since
he
made
no
attempt
to
force
obedience
there
were
half
a
dozen
pairs
of
hands
ready
and
eager
to
do
the
task
pansy
scorned
rayma
gaze
rested
jealously
on
the
english
girl
is
it
always
what
she
likes
casim
my
lord
and
never
what
you
wish
she
has
been
ill
and
i
humour
her
he
replied
shortly
ill
or
not
she
should
be
only
too
pleased
to
do
your
bidding
are
you
not
her
sultan
and
her
master
have
no
will
except
your
wishes
have
no
secrets
hidden
from
you
there
was
a
world
of
insinuation
in
rayma
voice
and
it
made
the
sultan
glance
at
pansy
in
a
quick
suspicious
manner
the
only
thing
he
suspected
her
of
doing
was
trying
to
escape
he
failed
to
see
how
she
could
get
out
of
her
present
quarters
but
the
mere
idea
of
losing
her
sent
a
chill
through
him
what
are
you
hiding
from
me
pansy
he
asked
presently
his
close
scrutiny
brought
a
flush
to
her
face
not
through
any
sense
of
guilt
but
because
of
her
unaccustomed
and
scanty
attire
he
saw
the
flush
and
his
suspicions
deepened
she
was
capable
of
doing
herself
some
injury
in
order
to
get
away
from
him
what
do
you
mean
rayma
he
asked
as
pansy
refused
to
answer
the
arab
girl
sidled
up
to
pansy
malice
and
triumph
in
her
eyes
do
you
really
want
to
know
my
lord
she
asked
smiling
at
him
softly
he
nodded
before
pansy
realised
what
was
happening
there
was
a
feeling
of
cold
steel
at
her
breast
totally
unprepared
it
seemed
that
rayma
was
going
to
stab
her
she
moved
back
quickly
as
she
moved
there
was
the
sharp
snip
of
scissors
a
rending
sound
a
quick
jerk
and
her
one
garment
was
dragged
from
her
the
arab
girl
retreated
quickly
holding
the
silk
slip
behind
her
leaving
pansy
nothing
but
her
curls
to
cover
her
a
covering
that
reached
no
further
than
the
nape
of
her
neck
with
a
cry
she
sank
on
the
floor
and
crouched
there
her
face
hidden
in
her
hands
flushed
with
shame
from
head
to
foot
laughing
triumphantly
rayma
pointed
a
scornful
finger
at
her
rival
look
casim
look
beloved
she
cried
that
is
the
secret
she
would
hide
from
you
those
ugly
scars
and
she
bathes
early
in
the
morning
when
none
of
us
are
there
so
that
we
shall
not
see
them
and
tell
you
for
she
knows
that
you
would
not
love
a
woman
so
flawed
the
other
women
looked
at
pansy
in
an
unconcerned
manner
clothing
was
of
no
great
consequence
to
them
moreover
it
was
just
as
well
not
to
interfere
when
rayma
chose
to
play
her
tricks
and
amuse
their
master
but
he
did
not
look
at
all
amused
what
was
more
his
gaze
did
not
go
to
the
slim
bare
girl
crouched
on
the
floor
he
looked
instead
at
rayma
give
the
girl
back
her
garment
he
said
in
an
ominously
quiet
tone
look
casim
look
my
lord
a
girl
so
blemished
is
not
worthy
of
often
you
have
said
no
woman
has
a
form
as
perfect
as
mine
but
look
and
compare
then
say
which
of
us
is
more
deserving
of
your
favour
she
snatched
off
her
own
light
garment
and
stood
before
him
slim
and
perfect
a
golden
statue
a
model
for
an
artist
the
sultan
eyes
were
fixed
on
her
still
but
there
was
no
appreciation
in
them
only
anger
give
the
girl
back
her
garment
he
said
again
when
you
have
looked
at
her
and
not
before
rayma
cried
defiant
in
the
surety
of
her
own
perfections
give
it
back
when
i
tell
you
he
said
in
a
savage
voice
a
tense
silence
followed
the
girls
and
women
glanced
at
one
another
and
waited
for
what
they
had
seen
happen
from
time
to
time
the
fall
of
a
favourite
rayma
coup
had
fallen
surprisingly
ominously
flat
the
sultan
refused
to
look
at
the
girl
whose
blemishes
had
been
unveiled
for
his
inspection
rayma
knew
it
too
and
as
she
gazed
at
the
cold
angry
face
of
her
master
she
saw
her
star
had
set
she
threw
the
silk
slip
at
pansy
who
still
crouched
on
the
floor
paralysed
with
shame
beside
herself
with
jealous
rage
the
arab
girl
then
stooped
and
picking
up
a
heavy
silver
goblet
hurled
it
at
her
rival
fortunately
it
missed
its
aim
and
went
skimming
and
crashing
along
the
marble
floor
this
attempted
assault
was
the
last
straw
a
savage
merciless
expression
came
to
her
master
face
at
this
look
rayma
fell
prostrate
at
his
feet
casim
love
me
a
little
and
i
ask
for
nothing
else
she
wailed
a
gong
stood
at
his
side
ignoring
her
he
struck
it
angrily
its
musical
notes
echoed
through
the
room
a
moment
later
a
couple
of
negroes
appeared
in
the
doorway
of
the
harem
the
sultan
gave
a
sharp
order
in
arabic
what
it
was
pansy
did
not
know
she
was
now
the
centre
of
a
group
of
women
who
with
brooch
and
jewelled
pin
were
adjusting
her
silk
slip
they
were
all
anxious
to
gain
her
good
graces
since
there
was
no
doubt
now
who
was
the
sultan
favourite
in
her
ear
leonora
was
whispering
there
no
need
to
be
ashamed
my
sister
our
lord
casim
never
once
glanced
at
you
his
eyes
and
his
anger
were
all
for
rayma
thanks
to
you
she
now
feels
what
i
once
felt
and
her
heart
is
breaking
but
if
pansy
did
not
know
what
the
sultan
said
the
crowd
around
her
did
they
whispered
affrightedly
among
themselves
and
edged
further
away
from
their
master
for
the
sultan
in
a
temper
was
a
person
to
be
avoided
and
rayma
knew
what
was
going
to
happen
she
started
up
with
dilated
eyes
and
screaming
then
clung
piteously
to
his
feet
casim
my
lord
beloved
not
that
she
cried
her
little
face
frantic
not
that
i
entreat
you
for
the
sake
of
the
nights
that
have
been
there
was
no
pity
on
his
face
only
savagery
all
mercy
had
been
swept
out
of
him
by
her
attempt
to
shame
and
injure
pansy
the
guards
returned
bringing
whips
on
seeing
them
rayma
screams
broke
out
afresh
piteous
little
pleas
for
mercy
wild
promises
never
to
offend
again
that
he
ignored
completely
then
she
fell
a
sobbing
golden
statue
at
the
feet
rayma
cries
and
helpless
reached
pansy
in
the
midst
of
her
own
dazed
shame
making
her
glance
in
the
direction
of
the
man
she
hoped
never
to
have
to
face
again
she
saw
the
huge
negroes
with
their
whips
awaiting
the
sultan
order
the
sobbing
helpless
girl
at
his
feet
and
on
his
face
a
look
she
had
never
seen
before
the
look
of
an
angered
and
pitiless
despot
for
a
moment
she
stood
aghast
not
able
to
credit
the
scene
before
her
as
she
looked
the
sultan
nodded
the
guards
raised
their
whips
and
they
fell
with
cruel
stinging
force
but
they
did
not
fall
on
rayma
there
was
one
in
the
harem
who
dared
come
between
the
sultan
and
his
wrath
the
whips
fell
on
white
shoulders
not
golden
ones
bringing
the
blood
oozing
to
skin
the
weight
and
pain
brought
pansy
to
her
knees
before
her
captor
raoul
she
gasped
i
ca
let
you
do
this
dreadful
thing
the
whips
fell
from
the
negroes
hands
aghast
they
stared
at
the
girl
before
them
it
was
not
their
fault
the
lashes
had
fallen
on
the
new
favourite
and
not
on
the
culprit
but
they
would
be
held
responsible
and
doubtless
beaten
nevertheless
the
women
and
girls
started
to
scream
and
wail
their
master
might
turn
on
them
for
letting
the
new
slave
get
within
reach
of
the
whips
but
who
was
to
know
she
would
dare
come
between
the
sultan
and
a
girl
he
thought
well
to
punish
he
paid
no
heed
to
the
frightened
stares
of
the
guards
the
wails
of
the
scared
women
to
rayma
still
sobbing
with
fright
not
pain
he
had
thoughts
and
eyes
for
nothing
but
the
girl
on
her
knees
before
him
with
the
red
weals
on
her
shoulders
horror
and
entreaty
in
her
eyes
pansy
calling
him
once
again
by
name
with
a
fierce
possessive
movement
he
stooped
and
gathered
her
into
his
arms
crushing
her
against
him
until
she
was
almost
lost
in
his
voluminous
robes
my
little
english
flower
you
ca
quite
hate
me
he
whispered
passionately
or
you
would
try
to
keep
me
what
you
once
thought
me
you
would
try
to
come
between
me
and
the
man
i
am
with
the
girl
in
his
arms
he
rose
scared
eyes
watched
him
as
he
crossed
the
big
hall
and
disappeared
behind
the
silken
curtains
then
the
girls
started
to
whisper
among
themselves
for
the
sultan
had
taken
this
new
slave
to
the
gilded
chamber
of
their
desires
chapter
xxiii
through
the
open
arches
of
the
gilded
chamber
the
moonlight
dripped
making
silver
ponds
on
the
golden
floor
filling
the
place
with
a
vague
shimmering
glow
one
bar
of
moonlight
fell
on
a
couch
where
pansy
lay
her
face
buried
in
the
cushions
by
her
side
the
sultan
knelt
one
arm
across
her
watching
her
with
glowing
passionate
eyes
the
last
few
minutes
had
been
a
haze
to
the
girl
a
blur
of
great
negroes
with
whips
of
rayma
sobbing
and
helpless
of
raoul
le
breton
cruel
as
she
had
always
felt
he
might
be
he
had
come
back
into
her
life
suddenly
that
lover
with
the
strong
arms
and
the
deep
caressing
voice
the
big
arrogant
man
whom
from
the
first
she
had
liked
and
had
never
been
afraid
of
what
dare
i
hope
what
dare
i
think
his
voice
was
saying
dare
i
think
that
you
do
quite
hate
me
look
at
me
my
little
slave
and
let
me
see
what
is
in
your
eyes
but
pansy
did
not
look
at
him
she
was
too
full
of
shame
and
confusion
despite
leonora
assurance
a
shame
and
confusion
that
the
sultan
guessed
at
for
he
stayed
caressing
her
golden
curls
with
a
soothing
touch
for
a
time
there
was
silence
through
the
room
the
wind
strayed
its
soft
breath
mingling
with
the
subtle
scent
of
sandalwood
somewhere
in
the
garden
an
owl
hooted
a
peevish
wail
in
the
night
came
the
cry
of
jackals
prowling
around
the
city
walls
under
that
firm
strong
soothing
hand
pansy
shame
subsided
a
little
for
the
girl
there
was
always
magic
in
his
touch
except
when
anger
raged
within
her
there
was
no
anger
now
only
a
sense
of
her
own
helplessness
and
the
knowledge
of
the
lives
he
held
in
his
power
under
the
silence
and
his
soothing
hand
a
question
trembled
to
her
lips
born
of
her
own
helplessness
and
the
dire
straits
of
her
father
and
friends
if
if
i
marry
you
will
you
send
my
father
and
friends
safely
back
to
gambia
she
asked
in
a
low
voice
he
laughed
tenderly
if
i
were
as
big
a
villain
as
you
think
me
i
say
and
then
break
faith
with
you
pansy
as
you
broke
faith
with
me
if
i
sent
them
back
my
little
flower
do
you
know
what
would
happen
your
english
friends
would
complain
to
the
french
government
an
expedition
would
be
sent
up
here
and
they
would
dole
out
to
me
the
fate
your
father
doled
out
to
mine
his
words
made
pansy
realise
for
the
first
time
that
his
summary
abduction
of
his
father
party
had
brought
him
foul
of
two
governments
horrified
she
gazed
at
him
her
father
and
friends
all
forgotten
at
the
thought
of
the
fate
awaiting
her
captor
they
would
shoot
him
this
big
fierce
man
all
fire
would
die
out
of
those
flashing
eyes
that
handsome
face
would
be
stiff
and
stark
in
death
never
again
would
that
hard
mouth
curve
into
lines
of
tenderness
when
he
smiled
at
her
there
would
be
no
strength
left
in
his
arms
no
deep
passionate
caressing
voice
no
untamed
masterful
man
using
all
his
power
to
bend
her
to
his
will
it
was
one
thing
for
pansy
to
want
to
kill
him
herself
but
quite
another
for
other
people
to
set
about
it
at
that
moment
she
realised
that
in
spite
of
everything
she
did
not
hate
the
sultan
casim
ammeh
and
what
was
more
he
knew
it
too
for
he
bent
over
her
laughing
softly
so
heart
ease
you
do
quite
hate
me
he
said
that
fact
will
keep
me
patient
for
quite
a
little
time
and
you
will
be
whispering
in
my
ear
as
i
would
have
you
whisper
it
of
your
own
free
will
as
you
whispered
love
you
on
that
sweet
night
six
months
ago
he
bent
still
lower
and
kissed
the
little
face
that
watched
him
with
such
strained
anxiety
good
night
my
darling
he
said
fondly
long
after
he
had
gone
pansy
lay
trying
to
crush
the
truth
back
into
its
in
her
heart
and
his
voice
tender
and
triumphant
seemed
to
echo
back
mockingly
from
the
jewelled
ceiling
for
surely
she
could
not
love
a
man
so
cruel
so
barbaric
so
profligate
as
the
sultan
casim
ammeh
chapter
xxiv
the
next
morning
pansy
awoke
to
find
herself
back
in
her
gilded
prison
and
alice
beside
her
with
the
customary
morning
tea
a
dish
of
fruit
and
a
basket
of
flowers
all
as
if
the
last
ten
days
had
never
been
she
knew
now
the
flowers
were
from
the
sultan
but
she
did
not
tell
alice
to
take
them
away
instead
as
she
drank
her
tea
and
ate
some
fruit
she
looked
at
them
in
a
meditating
manner
and
alice
looked
at
her
mistress
in
an
inquisitive
way
wondering
what
had
happened
to
her
during
the
last
few
days
de
sultan
he
no
sell
you
den
miss
pansy
no
pansy
replied
in
an
absent
manner
since
you
go

servants

the
girl
continued
her
eyes
round
with
awe
at
her
captor
wealth
and
power
she
spoke
too
as
if
anxious
for
an
exchange
of
confidences
however
pansy
said
nothing
she
stayed
with
her
gaze
on
the
flowers
despising
herself
for
having
been
so
upset
at
the
thought
of
the
sultan
demise
that
morning
alice
dressed
her
in
her
usual
civilised
attire
in
spite
of
this
pansy
found
she
was
still
a
prisoner
still
within
the
precincts
of
the
harem
the
rose
garden
was
hers
to
wander
in
at
will
but
the
guards
were
still
stationed
outside
one
of
the
sandalwood
doors
as
they
had
been
on
the
day
of
her
arrival
at
the
palace
however
one
of
the
two
other
doors
was
unlocked
pansy
opened
it
hoping
some
way
of
escape
might
lay
beyond
a
dim
flight
of
stairs
led
downwards
she
descended
only
to
find
herself
in
the
harem
the
girls
and
women
greeted
her
with
an
awed
and
servile
air
to
them
now
she
was
the
sultan
first
wife
the
most
envied
and
most
honoured
woman
in
the
province
of
curious
glances
were
cast
at
her
attire
leonora
appeared
most
at
her
ease
for
she
fingered
pansy
garments
with
soft
slow
indolent
hands
it
quite
ten
years
since
i
seen
a
woman
dressed
as
you
are
she
remarked
not
since
i
lived
in
tangier
before
my
uncle
sold
me
to
an
arab
merchant
pansy
knew
leonora
history
it
did
not
sound
a
pretty
one
to
civilised
ears
sold
at
the
age
of
fourteen
she
had
been
handed
from
one
desert
chief
to
another
until
finally
she
had
appeared
in
the
slave
market
of
and
had
taken
the
sultan
fancy
what
an
awful
life
you
had
pansy
said
pity
in
her
voice
leonora
languid
eyes
opened
with
surprise
me
oh
no
i
beautiful
and
most
of
my
masters
have
been
kind
but
none
so
kind
and
generous
as
the
sultan
casim
besides
now
my
travels
are
at
an
end
when
the
sultan
tires
of
a
slave
he
does
not
sell
her
she
is
given
in
marriage
to
one
of
his
officers
with
a
good
dowry
and
she
is
then
a
woman
with
an
established
position
he
is
always
generous
to
a
woman
who
has
pleased
him
how
lucky
for
you
to
be
picked
for
his
first
wife
you
find
him
almost
always
kind
i
been
here
more
than
a
year
and
i
know
he
is
never
harsh
without
a
reason
he
is
never
hard
and
unjust
like
some
of
the
masters
known
as
pansy
listened
to
this
eulogy
on
her
captor
she
was
surprised
and
ashamed
of
herself
for
having
a
scrap
of
liking
left
for
him
all
her
instincts
revolted
at
his
doings
but
much
as
she
tried
she
could
not
make
them
revolt
at
the
man
himself
he
was
hard
enough
last
night
she
remarked
but
he
had
a
reason
rayma
would
have
shamed
and
injured
you
she
could
not
see
what
i
saw
that
the
sultan
has
eyes
and
thoughts
and
heart
for
no
one
but
you
now
she
is
a
stupid
girl
that
rayma
because
he
loved
her
for
a
month
or
two
she
thought
he
would
love
her
for
ever
he
was
her
first
master
he
bought
her
but
a
few
weeks
before
he
last
went
to
paris
and
he
is
so
angry
now
that
he
will
sell
her
again
not
give
her
in
marriage
to
one
of
his
officers
making
her
a
woman
of
importance
leonora
remarks
made
pansy
glance
sharply
round
the
big
hall
suddenly
aware
that
rayma
was
not
present
already
she
saw
the
arab
girl
having
to
face
that
dreadful
sea
of
eyes
as
she
herself
had
faced
it
where
is
rayma
she
asked
quickly
the
guards
took
her
away
last
night
leonora
answered
indifferently
she
trouble
you
no
more
hastily
pansy
got
to
her
feet
and
went
to
the
big
door
leading
out
of
the
harem
she
knew
what
lay
beyond
a
large
vestibule
where
day
and
night
half
a
dozen
eunuchs
lounged
seeing
pansy
on
the
threshold
brought
them
to
their
feet
barring
her
exit
i
must
see
the
sultan
she
said
although
she
made
the
request
she
hardly
expected
to
have
it
granted
for
the
sultan
came
when
he
felt
disposed
lady
i
inform
the
sultan
of
your
desires
one
of
the
guards
replied
with
that
he
left
the
vestibule
pansy
waited
conscious
of
the
servility
and
overwhelming
desire
to
please
that
oozed
from
these
menials
before
long
the
messenger
returned
it
appeared
that
the
girl
wish
was
to
be
granted
with
a
negro
on
either
side
of
her
pansy
was
taken
through
an
intricate
maze
of
corridors
past
closed
doors
open
arches
and
arabesque
windows
to
a
further
door
that
her
escort
opened
pansy
found
herself
in
a
room
that
looked
more
like
a
sumptuous
office
than
anything
else
with
a
balcony
that
jutted
over
the
lake
at
a
large
desk
a
man
was
seated
in
a
white
drill
suit
with
a
black
cummerbund
who
rose
at
her
entry
and
smiled
at
her
as
if
the
last
week
had
never
been
as
if
he
were
still
raoul
le
breton
and
there
had
been
no
unveiling
well
pansy
it
flattering
to
think
you
want
to
see
me
he
remarked
pansy
did
not
waste
any
time
before
stating
the
reason
of
her
visit
is
it
true
you
going
to
sell
rayma
she
asked
in
a
tone
the
mere
mention
of
her
name
made
a
savage
expression
flit
across
his
face
what
i
going
to
do
with
her
is
my
own
concern
how
can
you
be
such
a
brute
such
a
savage
so
abominably
cruel
she
cried
distress
in
her
voice
do
you
know
my
little
slave
that
you
the
only
person
in
the
place
who
dare
take
me
to
task
about
my
doings
he
remarked
pansy
did
not
know
or
care
her
only
desire
was
to
save
him
from
himself
i
shall
stay
here
until
you
premise
not
to
sell
her
she
said
tensely
if
you
stay
until
doomsday
it
wo
worry
me
he
replied
you
must
find
some
other
threat
pansy
could
have
shaken
him
for
daring
to
poke
fun
at
her
when
her
only
desire
was
to
keep
him
from
how
can
you
even
contemplate
such
a
ghastly
thing
she
gasped
as
what
he
asked
in
an
unconcerned
manner
do
you
know
that
is
an
abomination
it
may
be
in
your
country
but
it
is
in
mine
i
ca
bear
to
think
of
you
doing
anything
so
dreadful
she
said
in
a
strained
voice
he
glanced
at
her
a
soft
mocking
light
in
his
eyes
should
you
like
me
any
better
if
i
did
sell
rayma
i
should
hate
you
if
you
did
i
could
run
such
a
risk
a
second
time
he
replied
i
send
her
back
to
the
harem
and
keep
her
there
until
i
can
find
a
suitable
husband
if
that
please
you
better
pansy
experienced
a
feeling
of
relief
the
victory
was
easier
than
she
had
expected
there
was
a
brief
pause
then
he
said
so
you
still
returning
good
for
evil
pansy
your
power
of
forgiveness
is
astonishing
rayma
deserved
punishment
for
her
treatment
of
you
if
anyone
deserves
punishment
it
you
pansy
retorted
how
do
you
make
that
out
for
trifling
with
her
for
a
moment
he
was
too
astonished
to
speak
if
you
call
that
trifling
then
i
must
have
trifled
with
at
least
a
hundred
women
in
my
day
he
remarked
at
length
how
can
you
stand
there
and
say
such
dreadful
things
she
gasped
there
nothing
dreadful
about
it
from
my
point
of
view
pansy
said
nothing
she
just
stared
at
him
as
if
at
some
fascinating
horror
under
her
gaze
he
began
to
find
excuses
and
explanations
for
himself
and
his
behaviour
do
you
remember
telling
me
in
that
letter
of
yours
that
you
were
not
quite
the
same
as
other
girls
putting
that
forward
as
a
sufficient
reason
for
breaking
faith
with
me
well
pansy
i
not
quite
the
same
as
the
other
men
you
known
to
begin
with
my
religion
is
different
in
my
own
small
way
i
a
king
i
rule
absolutely
within
a
radius
of
more
than
a
hundred
miles
round
here
then
i
a
millionaire
and
my
trading
extends
far
beyond
my
kingdom
as
far
as
louis
in
fact
and
millionaires
more
especially
if
they
men
and
unmarried
are
fêted
and
welcomed
everywhere
and
like
kings
millionaires
can
do
no
wrong
then
i
which
you
must
agree
is
a
wild
combination
such
a
mixture
does
tend
to
make
a
man
exactly
virtuous
i
done
exactly
what
i
liked
practically
ever
since
i
was
born
everybody
except
my
mother
did
their
best
to
spoil
me
she
was
the
only
one
who
ever
tried
to
keep
me
in
order
in
any
way
but
she
died
when
i
was
ten
years
old
at
fourteen
i
was
sultan
here
in
my
own
right
and
no
one
ever
dared
or
troubled
to
criticise
my
doings
until
you
came
along
and
now
expecting
me
to
be
a
better
man
than
ever
fate
or
nature
intended
me
to
be
pansy
said
nothing
she
still
looked
at
him
trying
now
to
see
his
point
of
view
call
what
you
done
with
me
promising
to
marry
me
and
then
drawing
back
i
never
trifled
with
you
and
if
you
can
believe
such
a
thing
and
if
you
try
and
see
it
in
my
light
been
faithful
to
you
i
never
had
a
thought
for
another
woman
since
the
night
you
came
into
my
life
until
i
learnt
you
were
daughter
then
i
tried
to
hate
you
and
went
back
to
my
old
life
but
when
you
were
brought
to
me
dead
as
i
thought
i
knew
i
did
hate
you
and
since
that
day
pansy
there
been
no
other
woman
but
you
and
you
satisfy
me
for
the
rest
of
my
life
pansy
listened
to
him
trying
to
see
things
as
he
saw
them
knowing
she
ought
to
be
disgusted
with
him
instead
she
was
intensely
sorry
because
there
had
never
been
anyone
at
hand
to
check
or
train
him
except
a
mother
who
had
died
twenty
years
ago
but
his
speech
brought
her
father
plight
before
her
again
it
seemed
hardly
feasible
that
the
sultan
would
have
sent
her
letter
to
the
man
he
desired
to
punish
did
you
give
that
note
of
mine
to
my
father
she
asked
a
trifle
askance
he
glanced
at
her
no
i
did
he
confessed
pansy
was
past
being
angry
with
him
she
was
just
sorely
wounded
in
soul
and
mind
at
his
doings
this
must
have
showed
on
her
face
for
he
went
on
quickly
you
can
send
another
and
i
promise
it
be
delivered
not
only
that
but
that
your
father
and
friends
will
be
well
treated
among
other
things
pansy
you
taken
the
edge
off
my
vengeance
he
paused
leaning
over
her
he
said
i
granting
you
all
these
favours
but
what
are
you
going
to
do
for
me
pansy
wanted
nothing
now
but
to
get
away
from
him
right
away
beyond
his
reach
but
not
because
she
hated
him
just
for
a
moment
my
little
english
flower
will
you
rest
upon
my
heart
he
asked
in
a
soft
caressing
voice
there
no
savagery
left
in
me
when
you
there
of
your
own
accord
he
held
out
his
arms
waiting
to
complete
the
bargain
but
she
moved
away
quickly
oh
no
she
said
alarm
in
her
voice
he
laughed
you
never
been
afraid
of
me
before
why
are
you
now
pansy
are
you
afraid
you
might
love
me
how
could
i
love
anyone
so
depraved
she
asked
but
her
voice
was
quavering
not
scornful
as
she
intended
it
to
be
depraved
so
that
what
i
am
now
is
it
well
it
all
point
of
view
i
suppose
and
it
one
degree
better
than
saying
you
hate
me
he
turned
towards
the
desk
and
drew
out
paper
and
envelopes
write
your
letter
my
little
girl
he
finished
pansy
sat
down
as
she
wrote
to
her
father
in
her
heart
was
a
wish
that
she
had
been
left
undisturbed
in
her
fool
paradise
that
she
had
married
raoul
le
breton
at
the
end
of
a
month
knowing
nothing
about
him
except
that
she
loved
him
once
he
was
her
husband
if
she
had
learnt
the
truth
she
would
not
have
had
to
fight
against
herself
and
him
there
would
have
been
only
one
course
left
open
to
her
to
do
her
utmost
to
make
a
better
man
of
him
and
circumstances
had
shown
her
that
in
her
hands
the
task
would
have
been
an
easy
one
chapter
xxv
when
sir
george
barclay
returned
to
prison
he
was
a
broken
man
his
officers
were
surprised
to
see
him
back
alive
and
anxious
to
hear
what
had
occurred
but
a
day
or
two
passed
before
he
was
able
to
talk
about
what
had
happened
and
always
before
him
was
the
bestial
figure
of
the
miser
feather
merchant
into
whose
hands
he
imagined
his
daughter
had
fallen
when
he
told
the
story
of
her
sale
a
strained
silence
fell
on
his
officers
a
silence
that
cameron
broke
the
damned
brute
he
said
in
a
wild
way
and
he
knew
her
in
grand
canary
the
fact
of
pansy
acquaintance
with
the
sultan
casim
ammeh
barclay
had
learnt
from
cameron
in
the
early
days
of
their
capture
the
younger
man
immediately
had
recognised
the
sultan
as
the
raoul
le
breton
who
when
out
of
africa
posed
as
a
french
millionaire
he
worse
than
a
savage
one
of
the
other
officers
put
in
since
he
knows
better
sir
george
had
nothing
to
say
once
the
story
was
told
pansy
fate
was
always
before
him
an
agony
that
chased
him
into
dreams
compared
with
which
his
own
death
would
have
been
as
nothing
one
morning
about
ten
days
after
the
sale
of
slaves
one
of
the
arab
guards
brought
him
a
letter
to
his
amazement
he
saw
his
daughter
writing
on
the
envelope
with
trembling
fingers
he
opened
it
wondering
how
she
had
managed
to
get
a
message
through
to
him
with
a
prayer
in
his
heart
that
by
some
miracle
she
might
have
escaped
her
horrible
fate
no
one
knows
better
than
i
how
you
must
have
suffered
on
my
account
i
tried
to
get
a
letter
through
to
you
before
but
i
have
just
heard
it
never
reached
you
so
i
am
sending
another
i
was
not
sold
that
day
in
the
the
sultan
never
intended
to
sell
me
he
only
sent
me
there
and
made
a
pretence
of
selling
me
in
order
to
hurt
you
i
am
in
the
palace
here
and
no
one
could
be
better
treated
than
i
am
i
asked
the
sultan
to
let
you
all
go
back
to
gambia
but
he
will
not
consent
to
that
but
he
has
promised
that
you
all
will
be
well
treated
you
must
not
worry
because
of
me
it
is
not
as
if
the
sultan
and
i
were
strangers
i
met
him
in
grand
canary
but
i
did
not
know
who
he
really
was
then
he
was
passing
under
a
french
name
it
is
very
difficult
to
know
what
to
say
to
cheer
you
up
i
know
you
will
worry
whatever
i
say
i
am
quite
safe
here
and
no
harm
will
happen
to
me
i
can
not
bear
to
think
of
you
worrying
and
you
must
try
not
to
do
so
for
my
sake
your
loving
daughter
pansy
as
george
barclay
read
through
the
letter
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
knew
what
had
happened
the
girl
had
bartered
herself
in
exchange
for
his
life
and
the
lives
of
her
friends
he
tried
to
gather
what
cold
comfort
he
could
by
keeping
the
picture
of
the
sultan
before
him
as
he
had
last
seen
him
big
and
handsome
in
his
khaki
riding
suit
looking
thoroughly
european
at
least
the
man
who
had
his
daughter
was
a
king
if
a
barbaric
one
and
civilised
to
a
certain
extent
she
had
not
fallen
into
the
clutches
of
that
grimy
naked
foaming
wretch
as
he
had
imagined
and
the
knowledge
eased
his
tortured
spirit
considerably
chapter
xxvi
after
that
interview
with
her
captor
pansy
life
rapidly
developed
into
one
long
struggle
between
inclination
and
upbringing
she
knew
she
loved
the
sultan
but
all
her
standards
revolted
against
marrying
him
she
could
not
bear
to
think
about
the
wild
past
that
was
his
but
she
equally
could
not
bear
to
think
that
he
might
fall
into
sin
again
when
hers
was
the
power
to
prevent
him
what
was
more
she
knew
he
had
guessed
her
love
for
him
and
was
doing
his
best
to
make
her
succumb
to
his
attractions
after
that
one
interview
she
was
not
allowed
out
of
the
sensual
scented
precincts
of
the
harem
she
had
no
occupation
no
amusements
no
books
even
nothing
to
do
all
day
except
just
think
about
her
lover
and
fight
her
battle
and
he
made
the
battle
all
the
harder
never
a
day
passed
but
what
he
was
there
big
and
handsome
and
fascinating
he
would
come
upon
her
in
the
little
walled
garden
and
linger
with
her
among
the
roses
by
the
hour
he
would
sit
with
her
in
the
wide
gallery
overlooking
the
desert
very
often
he
dined
with
her
in
the
gilded
chamber
and
stayed
on
afterwards
in
the
dim
light
of
the
shaded
lamps
watching
her
with
soft
mocking
eyes
and
very
often
he
would
say
well
pansy
have
you
made
up
your
mind
whether
you
are
going
to
marry
me
or
not
it
seemed
to
the
girl
that
the
whole
world
was
combining
to
drive
her
into
the
arms
of
a
man
she
ought
to
turn
from
with
contempt
and
disgust
at
the
end
of
a
fortnight
he
said
pansy
you
the
first
woman
who
has
ever
fought
against
her
love
for
me
it
an
amusing
sight
but
i
beginning
to
wish
you
were
such
a
determined
fighter
at
the
end
of
a
month
some
of
the
mockery
had
gone
out
of
his
eyes
giving
place
to
a
hungry
gleam
for
the
girl
had
not
succumbed
to
his
fascinations
although
her
face
was
growing
white
and
weary
with
close
confinement
and
the
ceaseless
battle
that
went
on
within
herself
and
the
man
who
acknowledged
no
law
except
his
own
appetites
and
who
up
till
now
had
lived
for
nothing
else
loved
the
girl
all
the
more
deeply
because
she
did
not
succumb
to
his
attractions
because
she
had
a
soul
above
her
senses
and
tried
to
live
up
to
her
own
ideals
refusing
to
come
down
to
his
level
at
times
he
felt
he
must
try
and
grope
his
way
up
to
the
heights
and
unconsciously
he
was
rising
from
the
depths
water
can
always
reach
the
level
it
rises
from
pansy
had
once
said
although
a
wild
craving
for
his
often
kept
him
wakeful
although
there
was
none
to
stop
him
and
only
a
short
length
of
passage
and
a
locked
door
to
which
he
alone
had
the
key
lay
between
him
and
his
desire
the
passage
was
never
crossed
the
door
never
unlocked
to
escape
his
presence
as
much
as
possible
pansy
spent
a
lot
of
her
time
in
the
big
hall
of
the
harem
with
the
other
girls
but
one
by
one
they
disappeared
to
become
the
wives
of
various
men
of
importance
in
the
place
until
only
rayma
was
left
a
quiet
subdued
rayma
who
watched
pansy
and
the
sultan
with
longing
envious
gaze
how
happy
you
must
be
now
you
are
his
wife
and
you
know
that
he
thrust
you
from
him
should
another
woman
take
his
fancy
the
arab
girl
sighed
one
day
to
her
rival
pansy
was
not
his
wife
and
she
had
no
intention
of
being
in
her
desire
to
escape
from
temptation
she
grew
absolutely
reckless
i
should
be
much
happier
if
i
could
get
right
away
from
him
she
said
in
response
to
rayma
remark
do
you
love
him
rayma
exclaimed
i
hate
him
pansy
said
lying
to
her
heart
i
never
want
to
see
him
again
she
went
on
in
a
hysterical
way
i
only
want
to
escape
from
him
and
this
place
once
and
for
ever
astonished
rayma
gazed
at
her
supplanter
then
a
look
of
hope
darted
into
her
dark
eyes
if
only
this
strange
girl
were
out
of
the
way
the
sultan
heart
might
return
to
her
chapter
xxvii
outside
a
little
french
military
settlement
several
ragged
tents
had
been
pitched
in
the
largest
of
them
the
miser
feather
merchant
was
sitting
on
a
pile
of
dirty
cushions
as
chance
would
have
it
his
caravan
had
gone
to
the
and
that
night
he
had
halted
within
three
hundred
miles
of
louis
with
him
was
an
arab
friend
a
nomad
like
himself
who
chanced
also
to
be
encamped
outside
the
little
settlement
a
year
had
passed
since
their
last
meeting
after
the
first
exchange
of
compliments
as
the
two
sat
smoking
together
the
remarked
to
the
miser
in
your
hunger
for
gold
you
grow
ever
thinner
and
more
haggard
a
wild
look
came
into
the
feather
merchant
eyes
it
is
not
hunger
for
gold
that
has
robbed
my
bones
of
their
flesh
he
replied
but
another
hunger
far
more
raging
his
friend
puffed
away
in
silence
and
as
he
puffed
he
had
in
mind
an
arab
proverb
wherein
it
is
said
that
a
man
can
fall
madly
in
love
with
the
shadow
of
a
woman
heel
then
it
the
shadow
of
some
woman
heel
he
remarked
more
than
her
shadow
the
miser
replied
in
a
parched
voice
i
saw
her
before
me
as
plainly
as
i
see
you
a
houri
from
paradise
his
friend
made
no
reply
considering
a
woman
was
under
discussion
it
was
bad
manners
to
ask
questions
he
waited
knowing
that
silence
on
his
part
would
be
the
most
likely
way
of
hearing
the
story
the
miser
bony
hands
clenched
and
his
tongue
went
round
his
bearded
lips
there
was
a
girl
i
desired
he
began
presently
a
maid
more
beautiful
than
the
morning
with
hair
golden
as
the
sun
and
eyes
deep
blue
as
desert
night
she
was
a
slave
and
with
my
wealth
i
would
have
bought
her
she
was
more
to
me
than
my
gold
but
there
was
another
more
rich
and
powerful
and
he
took
her
may
his
soul
perish
in
hell
as
the
miser
talked
an
amazed
look
crossed
his
friend
face
and
where
did
you
see
her
this
maid
with
the
hair
of
gold
and
deep
blue
eyes
he
asked
quickly
in
a
desert
city
a
month
journey
or
more
from
here
and
how
did
she
come
to
be
there
she
was
captured
by
the
sultan
who
rules
there
allah
curse
him
so
his
friend
ejaculated
then
he
stayed
for
some
moments
ruminating
on
the
matter
such
a
maid
was
stolen
three
months
or
more
ago
from
a
mighty
white
nation
whose
territory
lies
far
beyond
the
senegal
he
began
presently
and
that
white
nation
has
made
great
stir
and
commotion
with
our
rulers
the
french
for
the
maid
is
one
of
great
wealth
and
importance
in
her
own
country
possessed
of
riches
a
fortune
in
gold
pieces
more
numerous
than
the
grains
of
sand
in
the
sahara
a
month
ago
i
was
in
the
town
of
louis
and
the
people
there
talked
of
nothing
else
the
white
officers
here
search
for
her
in
all
directions
and
great
will
be
the
reward
of
the
man
who
can
lead
them
to
her
abductor
and
great
also
will
be
the
punishment
of
that
desert
ruler
even
death
tensely
the
feather
merchant
listened
then
he
started
up
with
a
wild
cry
allah
be
praised
he
shouted
for
my
prayer
has
been
granted
i
have
found
those
who
are
the
enemies
of
the
sultan
casim
ammeh
the
nation
most
mighty
of
all
on
this
earth
and
they
will
break
him
as
he
has
broken
me
then
he
darted
from
the
tent
running
like
a
madman
in
the
direction
of
the
french
military
quarters
chapter
xxviii
one
day
when
pansy
was
in
the
large
hall
of
the
harem
rayma
came
to
her
a
look
of
feverish
excitement
in
her
eyes
do
you
still
wish
to
escape
she
asked
watching
her
supplanter
as
if
she
could
not
believe
such
a
desire
could
lie
in
the
heart
of
any
woman
the
sultan
pleased
to
favour
for
pansy
her
struggle
became
daily
more
difficult
it
was
an
obsession
now
her
wish
to
escape
from
her
captor
how
can
i
whichever
way
i
turn
someone
is
there
to
stop
me
there
is
one
who
will
not
stop
you
not
if
he
is
paid
well
enough
rayma
said
her
voice
dropping
to
a
whisper
who
is
that
pansy
asked
quickly
one
of
the
eunuchs
who
guards
your
room
at
night
he
loves
jewels
beyond
all
things
on
earth
and
surely
the
sultan
has
given
you
plenty
although
you
never
wear
them
the
sultan
had
given
pansy
none
because
he
knew
she
would
not
accept
them
but
she
had
jewels
of
her
own
one
that
would
be
bribe
enough
for
anybody
the
great
diamond
that
had
aroused
her
lover
comments
one
night
in
the
moonlit
garden
of
grand
canary
pansy
clutched
at
the
mere
idea
of
escape
where
she
would
escape
to
she
did
not
pause
to
consider
to
escape
she
forgot
his
colour
his
religion
his
wild
life
his
treatment
of
her
father
everything
except
her
own
love
for
him
how
do
you
know
he
let
himself
be
bribed
she
asked
one
of
the
women
told
me
he
is
her
brother
i
spent
days
in
trying
to
help
you
get
away
oh
rayma
i
can
never
thank
you
enough
pansy
said
hysterically
grateful
the
arab
girl
cast
a
spiteful
glance
at
her
wondering
why
the
other
could
not
guess
that
it
was
her
rayma
one
desire
to
get
rid
of
her
rival
each
night
after
dark
you
must
open
your
door
the
arab
girl
went
on
there
will
come
a
night
when
only
one
of
the
guards
will
be
here
then
if
you
bribe
him
enough
he
will
let
you
pass
rayma
did
not
imagine
that
pansy
would
escape
she
expected
and
hoped
that
she
would
be
caught
in
the
attempt
judging
by
her
desert
standards
death
would
be
the
portion
of
any
who
dared
attempt
to
fly
from
her
owner
after
that
every
night
when
she
was
alone
pansy
opened
the
sandalwood
door
leading
into
the
long
dark
passage
by
which
she
had
first
entered
the
palace
then
one
evening
she
found
only
one
of
the
jewelled
guards
there
on
seeing
this
she
closed
the
door
again
and
going
to
her
jewel
case
got
out
the
one
big
diamond
from
the
gallery
of
her
sumptuous
prison
she
had
gathered
that
beyond
the
rose
garden
lay
the
grounds
of
the
sultan
own
quarters
where
she
had
spent
those
three
days
prior
to
his
unveiling
during
that
brief
time
she
had
noticed
that
at
night
and
during
the
heat
of
the
day
the
horses
that
browsed
in
the
paddock
were
stabled
in
a
long
low
building
at
the
far
end
of
the
scanty
field
and
she
knew
too
that
the
iron
gates
by
which
she
had
entered
the
palace
could
not
lie
so
very
far
away
from
the
paddock
with
trembling
hands
and
almost
sick
with
anxiety
and
excitement
pansy
opened
the
door
of
her
prison
she
said
nothing
to
the
guard
there
she
merely
held
the
gem
towards
him
on
seeing
it
his
eyes
glittered
covetously
without
a
word
he
took
the
diamond
pansy
passed
down
the
dim
passage
she
hardly
knew
how
her
feet
took
her
along
its
length
every
moment
she
expected
to
meet
someone
or
that
one
of
the
several
doors
leading
into
it
would
open
and
her
flight
be
brought
to
an
abrupt
end
however
unchallenged
she
reached
the
iron
gates
a
lamp
flickering
in
a
niche
close
by
showed
her
that
one
of
the
doors
was
slightly
ajar
with
shaking
hands
she
pulled
it
further
open
and
slipped
out
outside
all
was
silence
and
whiteness
like
a
sea
the
desert
stretched
away
to
a
milky
horizon
in
a
luminous
vault
the
moon
hung
a
great
round
molten
mass
that
filled
the
world
with
a
shimmer
of
silver
finding
herself
really
beyond
the
palace
precincts
took
all
strength
from
the
girl
hardly
daring
to
breathe
she
crept
a
few
steps
further
and
leant
against
the
city
wall
to
recover
a
little
and
get
her
bearings
then
furtive
as
a
shadow
she
made
her
way
towards
a
long
low
building
that
showed
up
like
a
huge
ebony
block
in
the
whiteness
there
were
others
as
furtive
as
pansy
prowling
round
the
city
walls
jackals
searching
for
offal
snarled
at
her
as
she
passed
along
slinking
away
and
showing
teeth
that
gleamed
like
ivory
in
the
moonlight
the
first
sound
of
them
made
her
start
violently
for
she
felt
the
sultan
hand
upon
her
drawing
her
back
to
himself
and
captivity
but
when
she
saw
the
prowlers
were
she
passed
on
heedless
of
them
until
the
paddock
fence
was
reached
to
climb
over
was
a
simple
task
then
she
ran
swiftly
across
the
grassy
space
suddenly
deadly
afraid
not
of
the
loneliness
but
that
the
stable
doors
might
be
locked
and
she
would
not
be
able
to
carry
out
her
project
however
in
there
were
no
thieves
daring
enough
to
steal
the
sultan
horses
so
the
doors
were
never
locked
they
creaked
ominously
when
pansy
opened
them
filling
the
still
night
with
harsh
sounds
sounds
that
she
felt
must
reach
her
captor
ears
inside
the
stables
were
vaguely
light
with
the
rays
of
the
moon
that
dripped
in
from
high
little
windows
fortunately
for
pansy
plan
it
was
the
hour
for
the
palace
servants
evening
meal
or
there
might
have
been
half
a
dozen
men
in
the
building
as
it
was
there
was
only
a
long
row
of
horses
each
in
separate
stalls
pansy
knew
that
if
her
protégé
were
there
he
would
answer
to
her
call
sultan
she
said
softly
there
was
a
whinny
from
a
stall
some
twenty
yards
away
guided
by
the
sound
she
went
in
that
direction
it
was
the
work
of
a
few
moments
to
unfasten
the
animal
but
to
pansy
it
seemed
an
age
her
hands
trembled
as
she
fumbled
at
the
halter
for
she
heard
pursuit
in
every
sound
then
she
led
the
animal
out
of
the
building
into
the
moonlight
and
closed
the
door
behind
her
she
was
an
expert
rider
leading
the
horse
to
the
fence
she
mounted
then
she
trotted
him
back
to
the
middle
of
the
enclosure
and
with
voice
and
hand
urged
him
towards
the
fence
again
in
his
old
steeplechasing
days
a
hurdle
the
height
of
the
rails
had
presented
no
difficulties
to
the
sultan
and
even
now
he
took
the
fence
at
an
easy
bound
once
over
it
seemed
to
pansy
that
the
last
obstacle
between
herself
and
freedom
had
been
circumvented
she
leant
forward
patting
her
horse
encouragingly
oh
sultan
she
said
hysterically
i
do
mind
where
you
take
me
so
long
as
i
can
get
away
from
here
left
to
itself
after
the
manner
of
horses
the
animal
picked
the
route
it
knew
the
best
the
sandy
track
along
which
the
sultan
casim
generally
took
it
for
exercise
for
the
first
mile
or
so
pansy
was
conscious
of
nothing
except
that
she
had
escaped
escaped
from
a
love
she
could
not
conquer
a
man
she
could
not
hate
white
and
billowy
the
world
lay
around
her
an
undulating
sea
of
sand
with
only
one
dark
patch
upon
it
the
city
of
the
track
the
horse
followed
wound
through
tufted
hillocks
mounds
of
silver
in
the
moonlight
here
and
there
a
stunted
shrub
cast
black
lines
on
the
whiteness
at
the
end
of
an
hour
pansy
discovered
she
was
not
the
rider
she
once
was
her
months
of
confinement
had
left
her
sadly
out
of
form
she
was
worn
out
with
the
exertion
and
the
excitement
of
escape
it
took
all
her
skill
to
keep
her
seat
on
the
horse
and
the
animal
knew
for
it
slackened
speed
as
a
good
horse
will
when
conscious
of
a
tired
rider
others
also
seemed
aware
that
something
weak
and
helpless
was
abroad
and
with
the
strange
magnetism
of
the
wild
they
were
drawn
towards
the
girl
here
and
there
in
the
melting
misty
distance
a
dark
form
appeared
lopping
along
at
a
safe
range
keeping
pace
with
the
old
horse
and
its
rider
every
now
and
again
glancing
at
the
two
with
glaring
green
eyes
and
calling
one
to
another
with
shrieks
of
maniacal
laughter
pansy
hardly
heard
the
hyenas
she
was
too
intent
on
keeping
her
seat
but
the
horse
heard
them
and
he
snorted
with
rage
and
fear
as
the
miles
sped
by
the
girl
was
aware
of
nothing
except
a
desire
to
get
further
and
further
away
from
her
lover
and
to
keep
her
seat
on
the
horse
then
she
became
aware
of
something
else
for
the
horse
halted
and
she
fell
off
flat
on
the
soft
sand
shaken
but
not
hurt
she
sat
up
and
gazed
around
a
little
oasis
had
been
reached
where
date
palms
stood
black
against
the
silver
and
a
tiny
spring
bubbled
with
cheerful
whisper
when
the
sultan
took
his
namesake
out
for
exercise
this
was
the
extreme
limit
of
their
ride
the
horse
had
been
there
once
already
that
day
and
in
the
shade
of
the
date
palms
the
man
and
the
horse
would
rest
awhile
before
returning
to
the
city
but
pansy
knew
none
of
these
things
she
only
knew
that
valuable
time
was
being
lost
sitting
there
on
the
ground
but
it
was
such
an
effort
to
get
up
green
eyes
had
seen
her
fall
as
if
dead
the
hyenas
crept
stealthily
forward
to
feast
upon
what
lay
helpless
in
the
sand
but
when
she
sat
up
they
retreated
to
squat
on
their
haunches
at
a
safe
distance
and
fill
the
night
with
demoniacal
laughter
the
sound
brought
pansy
to
her
feet
swaying
with
fatigue
she
had
heard
it
before
around
her
father
camp
in
gambia
but
it
was
one
thing
to
hear
the
hyenas
when
there
were
thirty
or
more
people
between
herself
and
them
and
another
now
that
she
was
quite
alone
in
the
desert
with
no
one
to
come
to
her
aid
the
chorus
of
mad
mocking
mirth
brought
fear
clutching
at
her
a
fear
that
the
horse
wild
snorts
increased
she
looked
round
sharply
to
find
there
were
at
least
a
dozen
of
the
brutes
on
her
trail
it
was
not
pansy
nature
to
show
fear
even
though
she
felt
it
going
to
the
spring
she
picked
up
several
large
stones
and
threw
them
at
the
hyenas
a
note
of
fear
crept
into
their
hideous
voices
they
beat
a
swift
retreat
melting
away
into
distance
there
was
too
much
life
left
in
the
girl
and
horse
for
them
to
attack
as
yet
gathering
her
tired
self
together
pansy
looked
round
for
a
rock
high
enough
to
enable
her
to
mount
by
as
it
happened
there
was
none
handy
taking
her
horse
by
the
mane
she
led
him
from
the
oasis
somewhat
protestingly
he
went
pansy
had
to
stagger
on
for
nearly
a
mile
on
foot
in
the
deep
fatiguing
sand
before
she
could
find
a
tussock
high
enough
to
mount
by
once
on
she
left
the
route
to
her
horse
to
the
uninitiated
one
portion
of
the
desert
looks
very
similar
to
another
and
the
girl
had
no
idea
that
the
horse
was
retracing
his
steps
making
his
way
slowly
and
laboriously
back
to
she
had
not
the
strength
left
even
to
look
around
her
the
hot
night
the
long
ride
the
sickly
excitement
attached
to
escaping
the
thirst
that
now
raged
within
her
and
the
final
tiring
walk
after
months
of
inactivity
had
told
upon
her
utterly
worn
out
she
just
managed
to
keep
her
seat
in
a
world
that
had
become
a
place
of
aching
weariness
through
which
there
rang
occasional
wild
shrieks
of
laughter
then
it
became
impossible
to
cling
on
any
longer
all
at
once
she
fell
off
and
stayed
in
the
sand
half
stunned
by
her
fall
conscious
of
nothing
except
that
she
had
escaped
from
the
sultan
casim
ammeh
when
she
fell
the
horse
stopped
he
stretched
a
long
neck
and
sniffed
and
sniffed
at
her
but
since
she
did
not
get
up
he
did
not
leave
her
he
waited
until
she
was
ready
to
start
off
again
quite
glad
of
the
rest
himself
however
there
was
not
to
be
much
rest
for
him
a
shriek
of
diabolical
laughter
rang
out
at
his
very
heels
with
a
snort
of
fear
and
rage
he
lashed
out
the
laughter
turned
into
a
howl
of
pain
and
one
of
the
hyenas
retreated
on
three
legs
with
a
broken
shoulder
but
there
were
twenty
or
more
of
them
now
against
one
old
horse
and
a
girl
too
utterly
exhausted
to
know
even
that
her
life
was
in
danger
and
each
of
the
hyenas
had
a
strength
of
jaw
that
could
break
the
thigh
of
an
ox
and
a
cowardice
of
heart
equalled
only
by
their
strength
for
sometime
they
circled
round
watching
their
prey
with
ravenous
glaring
green
eyes
and
every
now
and
again
one
or
the
other
made
a
forward
rush
only
to
find
those
iron
heels
between
it
and
its
meal
the
horse
understood
being
baited
in
this
manner
by
foes
just
beyond
his
reach
it
had
been
part
of
the
hell
the
girl
he
guarded
had
rescued
him
from
as
time
went
on
the
hyenas
grew
bolder
once
they
rushed
in
a
body
but
they
retreated
one
with
a
broken
jaw
one
with
a
mouthful
of
live
flesh
torn
from
the
sultan
flank
and
one
did
not
retreat
at
all
it
lay
with
its
skull
smashed
in
its
brains
bespattering
the
horse
hoofs
hoofs
over
which
now
a
red
stream
oozed
filling
the
hot
night
air
with
the
smell
of
live
blood
a
desperate
battle
raged
in
the
lonely
desert
under
the
white
light
of
the
moon
a
battle
that
filled
the
night
with
the
mad
mirth
of
hyenas
and
the
wild
shrieks
of
a
frightened
hurt
infuriated
horse
the
sultan
fighting
as
he
had
fought
that
day
in
the
east
end
of
london
when
pansy
had
first
come
across
him
but
fighting
for
her
life
as
well
as
his
own
against
the
cowards
that
beset
him
chapter
xxix
the
sound
of
that
desperate
conflict
rang
through
the
stillness
of
the
night
reaching
the
ears
of
a
man
who
was
riding
at
speed
along
the
sandy
track
leading
in
the
direction
of
the
oasis
those
diabolical
shrieks
of
laughter
filled
him
with
a
torture
of
mind
almost
past
bearing
in
them
he
heard
the
voices
of
hyenas
mangling
the
girl
he
loved
le
breton
had
always
known
pansy
would
run
away
if
an
opportunity
occurred
but
he
had
imagined
that
he
had
made
escape
impossible
after
dinner
he
went
to
the
gilded
room
to
pay
an
evening
visit
to
his
prisoner
since
business
affairs
had
kept
him
from
dining
with
her
however
she
was
not
there
experience
had
taught
him
that
it
would
be
no
use
looking
for
her
in
the
moonlit
garden
she
never
went
there
after
sunset
for
fear
he
should
come
across
her
and
the
beauty
and
romance
of
it
all
combined
with
his
presence
should
force
the
surrender
he
was
waiting
for
not
finding
pansy
in
her
own
private
quarters
he
went
into
the
big
hall
of
the
harem
only
to
be
told
she
had
not
been
there
since
well
before
dinner
on
learning
this
he
set
the
women
searching
in
every
corner
of
the
harem
but
pansy
was
nowhere
to
be
found
beyond
a
doubt
she
had
managed
to
escape
for
a
moment
the
news
dazed
him
he
did
not
waste
time
in
trying
to
discover
how
she
had
escaped
or
who
was
responsible
for
her
getting
away
she
had
gone
that
one
fact
glared
at
him
no
one
knew
better
than
the
sultan
himself
the
dangers
awaiting
the
girl
once
she
strayed
beyond
his
care
within
a
few
minutes
all
his
servants
and
soldiers
were
out
looking
for
the
fugitive
scouring
the
city
with
threats
of
the
dire
fate
awaiting
anyone
who
dared
either
hide
or
injure
the
sultan
wife
a
hasty
search
brought
no
trace
of
the
girl
but
one
of
the
search
parties
learnt
that
a
horse
was
missing
from
the
royal
stables
on
hearing
this
the
sultan
went
at
once
to
the
stables
looking
for
a
clue
there
the
missing
horse
was
pansy
the
discovery
sent
a
sudden
glow
of
hope
coursing
through
him
it
argued
that
somehow
or
other
she
had
managed
to
reach
the
stables
and
had
set
out
into
the
desert
the
sultan
understood
horses
even
better
it
seemed
to
him
now
than
he
understood
women
left
to
its
own
devices
the
old
horse
would
go
the
way
it
knew
the
best
the
way
he
generally
took
it
and
left
to
itself
it
was
almost
certain
to
be
since
its
rider
had
no
knowledge
of
any
of
the
sandy
tracks
that
lay
around
the
city
within
a
few
moments
he
was
on
the
swiftest
of
his
own
horses
riding
with
all
speed
towards
the
oasis
but
not
before
leaving
orders
with
his
officers
to
scour
the
desert
in
every
direction
he
had
ridden
perhaps
five
miles
when
into
the
stealthy
hiss
of
the
sand
another
sound
came
at
first
so
far
away
that
it
was
but
a
distant
moan
in
the
night
as
he
tore
on
rapidly
it
grew
louder
developing
into
a
chorus
of
hideous
laughter
the
cry
of
hyenas
howling
round
their
prey
desert
reared
instinctively
he
knew
there
must
be
at
least
twenty
of
them
when
above
the
mêlée
he
heard
the
terrorized
screams
of
a
horse
a
deadly
fear
clutched
him
where
the
horse
was
the
girl
was
and
the
sound
told
him
the
two
had
been
attacked
around
pansy
the
ghastly
conflict
was
raging
around
her
mangled
corpse
perhaps
he
suffered
all
the
tortures
of
the
damned
as
with
spur
and
crop
he
urged
the
great
stallion
onwards
until
the
animal
was
a
lather
of
sweat
and
foam
the
hyenas
heard
the
throb
of
those
approaching
hoofs
and
fear
gripped
their
cowardly
hearts
the
disconcerting
noise
grew
speedily
louder
on
the
whiteness
of
the
lonely
desert
a
dark
patch
appeared
a
patch
that
rapidly
became
bigger
and
headed
straight
towards
them
it
was
one
thing
to
attack
a
tired
old
horse
and
a
girl
but
another
to
face
a
huge
black
stallion
and
the
big
man
in
the
white
burnoose
who
rode
it
the
hyenas
did
not
face
the
combination
with
a
weird
howl
of
disappointment
they
turned
tail
suddenly
and
scuttled
away
into
the
desert
leaving
the
old
horse
shivering
with
relief
and
pain
and
exhaustion
the
feeling
of
someone
touching
her
made
pansy
open
her
eyes
into
her
hazy
world
her
captor
face
intruded
he
was
on
the
sand
beside
her
examining
her
limbs
feeling
her
heart
to
see
if
she
were
injured
in
any
way
for
a
moment
pansy
could
not
believe
her
eyes
then
she
put
out
a
weak
hand
to
push
him
away
but
a
push
did
not
remove
him
he
was
still
there
in
white
cloak
and
hood
a
desert
chief
who
wanted
to
marry
her
big
and
solid
he
knelt
beside
her
a
fact
not
to
be
escaped
from
and
his
hand
was
on
her
bosom
as
if
to
steal
the
heart
she
would
not
give
him
satisfied
pansy
was
not
hurt
in
any
way
the
sultan
got
to
his
feet
and
turned
towards
the
horse
it
needed
more
attention
than
the
girl
he
petted
and
patted
the
shivering
animal
talking
to
it
in
a
deep
caressing
voice
as
he
bound
up
its
gaping
wounds
with
lengths
torn
from
his
own
white
garments
then
he
lifted
the
girl
on
his
own
horse
and
mounting
himself
set
out
on
a
slow
walk
towards
his
city
pansy
made
a
feeble
struggle
when
she
found
herself
in
his
arms
her
head
resting
against
his
shoulder
held
in
a
tight
possessive
grip
so
little
flower
you
would
still
try
to
escape
from
me
he
said
in
a
fierce
fond
manner
but
i
do
let
love
go
so
lightly
he
ignored
her
struggles
as
he
talked
to
and
encouraged
the
old
horse
that
hobbled
along
by
their
side
with
stiff
painful
steps
as
the
slow
journey
went
on
pansy
fell
asleep
against
the
strength
that
held
her
the
sultan
was
quick
to
note
this
and
he
smiled
at
the
small
tired
face
on
his
shoulder
he
knew
the
nature
of
the
girl
he
held
it
would
be
impossible
for
her
to
go
to
sleep
in
any
man
arms
except
those
of
the
man
she
loved
she
was
very
foolish
to
fight
against
him
but
fight
she
would
until
he
used
his
strength
and
ended
the
battle
an
uneven
contest
the
last
round
would
be
with
no
doubt
as
to
who
would
be
the
victor
chapter

on
a

in

pansy
lay
the

burning
low
casting
black
shadows
on
the
gilded
walls
of
her
cage
through
the
open
arches
the
moonlight
streamed
pouring
in
from
a
misty
mystic
world
where
trees
sighed
vaguely
in
a
silvered
air
early
that
morning
the
sultan
had
brought
pansy
back
to
the
palace
since
then
she
had
seen
nothing
of
him
she
brooded
on
her
attempt
to
escape
which
had
only
ended
in
her
being
more
of
a
prisoner
than
ever
the
guards
about

quarters
had
been
doubled

door

said
to
her

she
lay
among
the
silken
cushions
brooding
on
the
life
that
had
once
been
hers
a
life
so
remote
from
her
present
one
that
it
might
never
have

it
was
impossible
to
believe
that
far
beyond
this
desert
city
there
lay
a
place
called
london
where
she
had
been
free
as
air
where
she
could
come
and
go
as
she
pleased
where
she
had
dined
and
danced

the

in
on

dreary
reverie
it
was
close
on
midnight
she
had
never
been
disturbed
at
that
hour
before
she
looked
up
quickly
the
third
door
of
her
room
was
opening
one
that
had
never
opened
before
a
door
the
harem
girls
had
told
her
led
to
the
sultan
private
suite
and
the
sultan
himself
was
entering
the
sultan
attired
as
she
had
never
seen
him
before
in
silk
pyjamas
pansy
started
to
her
feet
she
stood
slight
and
white
and
against
the
golden
walls
her
heart
beating
with
a
sickly
force
that
almost
choked
her
her
eyes
wide
with
fear
the
end
had
come
with
a
suddenness
she
was
not
prepared
for
he
crossed
to
her
side
tenderness
and
determination
on
his
face
love
and
passion
in
his
eyes
for
a
moment
there
was
silence
so
pansy
he
said
at
length
you
tried
to
solve
the
problem
your
way
now
i
going
to
solve
it
mine
you
fought
against
love
quite
long
enough
against
yourself
and
against
me
i
going
to
end
the
fight
between
us
my
little
slave
you
sleep
within
my
arms
and
learn
all
that
love
means
at
his
words
a
flood
of
crimson
swept
over
her
strained
face
she
had
but
a
vague
idea
of
what
was
before
her
but
instinct
told
her
it
was
something
she
must
fight
against
her
gaze
went
to
the
arches
as
if
in
search
of
some
way
of
escape
there
there
was
none
only
the
white
stars
looked
in
coldly
and
night
breathed
on
her
soft
and
sensuous
he
knew
where
her
thoughts
were
and
he
laughed
softly
there
no
escape
this
time
pansy
he
said
the
fear
in
her
eyes
deepened
wildly
she
searched
round
in
her
head
for
a
way
of
getting
rid
of
him
for
the
time
being
and
only
one
course
presented
itself
i
i
marry
you
she
stammered
we
be
married
by
all
means
if
you
wish
as
soon
as
i
can
find
a
man
to
do
the
job
but
you
been
just
a
little
too
long
in
making
up
your
mind
my
patience
is
worn
out
in
her
determination
to
live
up
to
her
own
standards
standards
that
had
no
value
in
this
desert
city
pansy
saw
she
had
tried
this
man
too
far
he
came
closer
and
held
out
his
arms
come
my
little
flower
he
whispered
passionately
quickly
she
moved
further
away
from
the
arms
that
would
have
held
her
wo
you
come
willingly
he
asked
in
soft
caressing
tones
do
you
still
refuse
me
the
love
i
want
and
which
i
know
is
mine
i
do
want
you
or
your
love
she
cried
wildly
frantic
at
the
knowledge
of
her
own
helplessness
he
laughed
with
a
touch
of
fierceness
what
cruel
words
to
throw
at
your
lover
but
since
you
wo
come
my
little
slave
then
i
must
take
you
he
would
have
taken
her
there
and
then
but
with
a
swift
movement
she
avoided
him
then
pansy
ran
as
she
had
run
from
him
once
before
like
a
white
wraith
in
the
moonlight
but
this
time
he
followed
there
were
no
electric
lights
and
ragtime
band
to
run
to
now
only
a
moonlit
garden
full
of
the
scent
of
roses
there
was
no
crowd
of
people
to
give
her
shelter
only
the
deep
shadows
of
the
cypresses
in
the
darkness
she
paused
out
of
breath
hoping
he
would
not
see
her
a
vain
hope
his
eyes
had
learnt
to
pierce
the
gloom
she
was
in
his
arms
almost
before
she
knew
it
there
was
a
brief
uneven
struggle
as
pansy
fought
against
a
man
who
knew
no
law
except
his
own
desires
weak
and
weeping
she
collapsed
against
him
on
a
heart
that
leapt
to
meet
her
there
was
a
stone
seat
near
on
it
the
sultan
seated
himself
the
girl
in
his
arms
and
in
the
scented
sighing
silence
he
tried
to
soothe
the
tears
his
methods
had
roused
and
trembling
she
lay
against
the
passion
and
power
that
held
her
refusing
to
be
comforted
there
nothing
to
weep
about
my
darling
he
whispered
sooner
or
later
you
have
to
learn
that
i
your
master
just
as
you
taught
me
that
all
women
are
not
ripe
fruit
willing
and
anxious
to
fall
into
my
hands
and
i
must
have
some
closer
tie
between
us
since
love
alone
wo
keep
you
from
running
away
from
me
pansy
tears
fell
all
the
faster
for
now
it
seemed
her
own
doings
were
responsible
for
this
crisis
he
sat
on
waiting
until
the
storm
was
over
the
tremors
of
the
slight
form
that
lay
against
his
heart
so
helpless
yet
so
anxious
not
to
do
wrong
struck
through
the
fire
and
passion
in
the
man
to
what
lay
beneath
true
love
and
protection
presently
he
kissed
the
strained
face
pillowed
against
his
shoulder
it
like
old
times
to
be
sitting
in
the
moonlight
and
among
the
roses
with
you
in
my
arms
he
said
all
at
once
do
you
remember
pansy
that
sweet
night
in
grand
canary
but
you
were
not
weeping
then
why
are
you
now
my
little
slave
because
a
sultan
loves
you
more
than
his
life
more
than
anything
that
has
been
in
his
life
you
not
very
flattering
but
then
you
never
were
he
paused
for
a
moment
watching
her
tenderly
yet
you
paid
me
the
greatest
compliment
i
ever
had
in
my
life
when
you
said
you
loved
me
there
could
be
no
sweeter
music
that
those
words
and
the
choicest
gift
life
has
ever
given
me
was
a
kiss
from
your
lips
given
willingly
he
bent
his
head
wo
you
give
me
another
pansy
but
the
girl
strained
face
was
turned
away
from
the
proud
passionate
one
so
close
to
her
own
no
my
little
flower
will
you
make
a
thief
of
your
sultan
will
you
give
him
nothing
willingly
now
i
know
i
do
deserve
it
but
still
i
want
it
and
my
wants
have
been
my
only
law
so
far
again
he
paused
stroking
her
curls
with
a
loving
hand
just
now
as
man
and
woman
together
pansy
i
know
i
do
deserve
you
i
know
i
not
worthy
of
you
but
i
want
my
soul
although
only
a
blackened
body
to
offer
it
and
the
soul
will
have
to
do
the
best
it
can
with
the
grimy
accommodation
for
i
must
have
you
my
darling
you
taken
everything
out
of
my
life
but
a
desire
for
you
from
a
tangle
of
trees
in
an
adjacent
garden
a
nightingale
burst
into
song
filling
the
night
with
liquid
melody
at
the
sound
the
arms
tightened
around
the
slender
figure
he
held
no
man
appreciates
virtue
so
much
as
the
one
who
has
had
his
fill
of
vice
he
continued
presently
and
i
was
born
into
it
steeped
and
sodden
in
it
from
my
earliest
recollection
until
i
did
realise
it
was
vice
until
i
met
you
and
then
it
seemed
to
me
i
had
run
off
the
lines
and
pretty
badly
as
he
sat
talking
and
caressing
her
pansy
sobs
died
down
there
was
always
magic
in
his
touch
happiness
within
his
arms
with
throbbing
heart
she
lay
against
him
watching
him
anxiously
he
smiled
into
the
tired
purple
eyes
no
perhaps
i
wo
be
a
thief
he
said
perhaps
i
shall
climb
up
and
up
with
many
a
stumble
to
the
clear
heights
where
you
are
my
darling
what
would
you
say
if
you
saw
me
there
is
a
poor
wretch
who
has
climbed
painfully
upwards
to
touch
the
feet
of
his
ideal
you
would
say
to
yourself
and
to
me
you
would
say
a
reward
will
you
come
and
have
breakfast
with
me
and
i
should
come
like
a
shot
and
i
should
want
lunch
and
tea
and
dinner
and
you
just
you
my
soul
always
and
for
ever
after
this
outburst
he
was
quiet
passive
within
his
arms
pansy
waited
for
the
last
hopeless
struggle
for
right
against
wrong
he
sat
on
as
if
at
peace
with
himself
and
the
world
the
restless
look
that
always
lurked
in
his
eyes
had
gone
in
its
place
was
one
of
happiness
and
contentment
pansy
shivers
roused
him
from
his
reverie
not
shivers
of
fear
but
of
chilliness
a
heavy
dew
had
started
falling
bringing
a
sudden
coolness
into
the
night
why
heart
ease
he
said
full
of
concern
i
keeping
you
out
here
when
you
ought
to
be
indoors
but
with
you
in
my
arms
i
forget
everything
but
you
getting
to
his
feet
he
took
her
back
to
the
gilded
room
the
lamps
had
burnt
out
it
was
a
place
of
deep
shadows
and
here
and
there
the
silver
of
the
moon
patched
its
golden
richness
once
within
its
dimness
pansy
started
struggling
again
he
took
the
slim
white
hands
into
one
of
his
own
and
kissed
them
there
no
need
for
you
to
fight
against
me
with
weak
little
hands
he
whispered
there
another
fighting
for
you
far
stronger
than
you
are
a
new
raoul
le
breton
of
your
making
pansy
a
man
strong
enough
to
wait
until
we
really
married
laying
his
burden
on
a
couch
he
bent
his
head
until
his
ear
almost
touched
the
girl
lips
say
pansy
and
i
go
and
quietly
like
a
good
boy
still
remembering
reputation
he
said
in
a
teasing
tone
into
his
ear
yes
trembled
he
kissed
the
lips
that
at
last
had
consented
to
his
wishes
good
night
my
little
girl
and
if
you
go
on
at
this
rate
you
make
a
white
man
of
me
yet
long
after
he
had
gone
pansy
stayed
brooding
on
his
words
the
battle
between
them
was
over
at
last
chapter
xxxi
on
one
of
the
terraces
of
his
palace
the
sultan
sat
at
breakfast
as
he
lingered
in
the
sweet
cool
air
of
early
morning
he
pondered
on
the
happenings
of
the
night
before
at
last
he
had
wrung
a
reluctant
consent
from
his
cherished
prisoner
there
was
a
flaw
in
his
victory
that
he
tried
not
to
see
that
yes
would
not
have
come
except
that
the
girl
had
been
absolutely
cornered
the
word
had
not
come
from
her
lips
spontaneously
as
those
three
words
i
love
you
had
he
tried
to
forget
this
fact
as
he
thought
out
the
best
means
of
bringing
about
a
speedy
wedding
there
was
no
minister
of
her
faith
in
the
nearest
christian
mission
lay
at
least
two
hundred
miles
distant
it
would
be
risky
work
bringing
a
white
missionary
to
his
city
the
safest
course
would
be
to
take
her
down
to
a
mission
station
and
marry
her
there
no
one
would
know
then
where
they
had
come
from
and
the
journey
back
would
make
a
delightful
honeymoon
on
the
delights
of
that
honeymoon
he
pondered
from
his
reverie
he
was
rudely
aroused
by
a
sound
which
made
marriage
seem
very
remote
and
death
much
more
likely
to
be
his
portion
there
was
a
sudden
shriek
high
above
the
city
followed
by
a
deafening
roar
as
a
shell
exploded
over
a
command
for
its
surrender
the
sultan
started
to
his
feet
his
face
reckless
and
savage
the
cup
was
at
his
lips
only
to
be
dashed
away
he
knew
what
had
happened
somehow
or
other
the
french
government
must
have
heard
that
he
was
responsible
for
the
capture
of
the
english
governor
and
an
expedition
had
been
sent
up
to
punish
him
for
his
marauding
ways
that
same
sound
startled
pansy
as
she
stood
by
the
sunken
pond
in
the
rose
garden
feeding
the
carp
wondering
what
had
happened
she
looked
up
at
the
smoke
that
lay
like
a
little
cloud
between
the
city
and
the
sky
she
did
not
wonder
for
very
long
present
another
shell
came
shrieking
out
of
the
distance
then
she
guessed
what
had
occurred
and
her
face
blanched
swiftly
she
went
to
her
room
her
only
idea
to
reach
the
sultan
and
save
him
from
his
enemies
but
all
the
doors
of
her
prison
were
locked
and
neither
knocks
nor
shouts
produced
any
answer
she
went
back
to
the
fretted
gallery
to
see
what
could
be
seen
from
there
a
mile
or
so
away
like
a
dark
snake
on
the
desert
she
saw
the
relief
party
as
she
watched
a
force
left
an
array
of
arab
soldiers
on
recognising
their
leader
her
soul
went
sick
within
her
he
was
there
her
lover
the
man
she
ought
to
hate
going
out
to
fight
the
men
who
had
come
to
her
rescue
if
the
french
officers
heading
the
expeditionary
force
imagined
the
sultan
of
had
come
out
to
surrender
they
quickly
discovered
their
mistake
he
had
come
out
to
fight
and
what
was
more
fight
well
and
recklessly
against
a
force
that
if
inferior
in
numbers
was
vastly
superior
in
arms
presently
the
shells
no
longer
shrieked
above
they
were
aimed
at
it
from
her
gallery
pansy
saw
the
two
forces
meet
then
she
could
look
no
longer
men
fell
in
the
sand
and
rose
no
more
and
any
one
of
them
might
be
her
lover
she
went
back
to
her
room
and
crouched
there
in
terror
her
father
and
friends
all
forgotten
at
the
thought
of
the
man
who
might
be
lying
dead
in
the
sand
as
the
morning
wore
on
the
din
of
battle
grew
nearer
every
now
and
again
a
shell
got
home
there
were
screams
of
terrified
people
the
heavy
fall
of
masonry
the
moans
and
cries
of
the
injured
once
pansy
thought
her
end
had
come
a
shell
struck
the
palace
the
place
rocked
to
its
foundations
there
was
the
thunder
of
falling
masonry
as
if
the
four
walls
of
her
room
were
crashing
down
upon
her
she
closed
her
eyes
and
waited
a
few
moments
later
she
opened
them
and
was
surprised
to
find
her
gilded
prison
very
little
damaged
it
was
badly
cracked
and
several
blocks
of
stone
had
crashed
down
from
the
ceiling
one
on
the
sandalwood
bureau
near
where
she
crouched
smashing
it
to
splinters
and
scattering
the
contents
about
her
feet
more
than
once
pansy
had
rummaged
in
its
scented
recesses
until
she
knew
its
contents
by
heart
she
had
found
nothing
but
a
few
quills
sheets
of
paper
yellow
with
age
and
quaint
bottles
in
which
the
coloured
inks
had
dried
she
knew
the
desk
had
belonged
to
the
sultan
mother
just
as
she
knew
the
gilded
room
had
been
the
french
girl
prison
as
she
gazed
at
the
debris
at
her
feet
it
seemed
she
could
not
have
searched
thoroughly
among
the
splinters
was
something
she
had
not
seen
before
a
few
sheets
of
paper
folded
flat
and
tied
with
a
strand
of
silk
that
must
have
been
hidden
behind
one
of
the
many
drawers
more
to
get
her
thoughts
away
from
the
battle
raging
round
her
than
anything
else
pansy
picked
up
the
tiny
packet
untying
the
silk
she
opened
the
faded
scented
sheets
and
glanced
at
them
after
the
first
glance
she
stayed
riveted
and
as
she
read
on
she
forgot
everything
except
what
the
letter
said
it
was
in
french
in
a
woman
hand
and
the
date
was
now
more
than
twenty
years
old
a
statement
written
by
annette
le
breton
before
she
died
proclaiming
her
son
real
identity
and
left
by
her
in
the
bureau
some
servant
rummaging
in
the
desk
for
trinkets
after
her
mistress
death
must
have
let
it
slip
behind
one
of
the
numerous
drawers
pansy
read
of
colonel
raoul
le
breton
expedition
to
the
how
he
and
his
little
force
had
been
murdered
by
the
sultan
casim
ammeh
she
learnt
of
annette
le
breton
fate
at
the
hands
of
her
savage
captor
of
the
son
who
had
come
nearly
nine
months
after
her
husband
death
the
son
the
sultan
casim
ammeh
imagined
to
be
his
raoul
is
not
the
son
of
the
sultan
casim
ammeh
the
faint
handwriting
declared
he
is
the
son
of
my
murdered
husband
colonel
raoul
le
breton
i
know
for
every
day
he
grows
more
like
his
dear
dead
father
yet
he
imagines
the
sultan
to
be
his
father
and
i
dare
not
tell
him
the
truth
for
if
the
sultan
learnt
the
boy
was
not
his
he
would
kill
him
for
raoul
sake
i
must
let
the
deception
go
on
for
the
sake
of
my
son
who
is
all
i
have
to
live
for
and
my
heart
breaks
for
daily
my
boy
grows
more
and
more
to
love
that
savage
chief
who
murdered
his
real
father
pansy
read
of
annette
dreary
years
in
the
harem
of
her
captor
years
that
have
no
light
in
them
save
my
son
years
that
i
should
not
have
endured
except
for
my
child
my
boy
the
son
of
my
brave
raoul
it
was
a
story
of
love
and
sacrifice
of
a
mother
tortured
to
save
her
child
from
the
fate
that
had
befallen
his
father
the
sultan
will
make
my
boy
like
himself
the
letter
went
on
for
there
is
no
one
at
hand
to
stop
him
daily
my
influence
grows
less
and
his
stronger
the
boy
admires
and
copies
the
man
he
deems
his
father
he
is
too
young
to
know
the
sultan
for
what
he
really
is
he
sees
only
a
man
bold
and
picturesque
and
the
sultan
spoils
him
utterly
he
encourages
him
to
be
cruel
and
arrogant
he
fosters
all
that
is
bad
in
the
boy
it
is
useless
for
me
to
try
and
check
him
for
my
own
son
laughs
at
me
now
the
writing
grew
more
feeble
as
the
letter
went
on
the
wild
entreaty
of
a
mother
who
had
no
life
outside
of
her
son
and
who
saw
him
being
ruined
by
his
own
father
murderer
whoever
finds
this
be
kind
to
my
boy
my
raoul
for
the
sake
of
a
woman
who
has
suffered
much
for
the
sake
of
his
martyred
father
colonel
raoul
le
breton
do
not
judge
my
son
by
what
he
is
but
by
what
he
might
have
been
in
the
sultan
casim
he
has
a
bad
example
a
savage
teacher
a
wild
profligate
cruel
man
who
would
make
the
boy
as
barbarous
as
he
is
himself
the
writing
grew
even
more
feeble
a
faint
scrawl
on
the
yellow
paper
i
am
dying
and
my
son
is
far
away
i
shall
not
live
until
my
boy
returns
and
he
will
be
left
with
no
influence
but
the
sultan
o
fate
deal
kindly
with
my
boy
my
raoul
left
alone
with
savages
in
this
barbaric
city
i
have
only
endured
these
dreadful
years
for
the
sake
of
my
son
in
the
name
of
pity
be
kind
to
him
he
will
have
no
chance
in
the
hands
of
his
present
teacher
have
mercy
for
the
sake
of
his
tortured
mother
and
his
father
that
brave
soldier
who
gave
his
life
for
france
annette
le
breton
pansy
read
the
sheets
through
without
once
raising
her
eyes
she
was
ravenous
for
the
contents
at
that
moment
it
seemed
as
if
the
dim
gilded
room
were
full
of
tears
and
sorrows
the
faint
sweet
fragrance
of
the
girl
who
had
lived
there
long
years
ago
suffering
and
enduring
for
the
sake
of
her
boy
it
was
not
in
pansy
kind
heart
to
refuse
that
tragic
mother
pleading
for
her
son
then
she
remembered
that
colonel
le
breton
son
was
out
there
fighting
against
his
own
people
if
indeed
he
were
still
left
alive
to
fight
her
lips
moved
in
silent
prayer
she
kissed
the
faded
scented
sheets
and
tucked
them
against
her
heart
she
was
not
going
to
fail
annette
all
she
wanted
now
was
to
be
at
the
side
of
the
dead
girl
son
to
help
him
to
build
up
a
new
character
according
to
the
best
white
codes
and
standards
then
she
sat
on
listening
to
the
battle
that
raged
around
the
desert
city
if
raoul
le
breton
were
spared
there
was
another
battle
before
her
a
battle
with
two
governments
for
his
life
but
she
had
not
many
qualms
about
the
result
with
annette
letter
her
own
wealth
and
her
father
on
her
side
as
he
would
be
once
she
had
explained
the
situation
morning
dragged
on
into
afternoon
and
the
sound
of
the
conflict
died
down
somewhat
all
at
once
as
if
muffled
by
distance
she
heard
her
lover
voice
calling
hoarsely
pansy
she
started
to
her
feet
before
she
could
answer
there
was
a
sound
of
fighting
just
beyond
her
quarters
then
she
heard
her
father
voice
strained
and
anxious
pansy
are
you
in
there
oh
father
she
called
back
frantically
do
let
them
kill
the
sultan
there
came
more
muffled
voices
then
the
sound
of
masonry
being
shifted
as
the
men
outside
her
prison
started
clearing
away
the
debris
that
blocked
the
door
chapter
xxxii
evening
shadows
were
settling
over
deep
grey
shadows
that
for
all
their
gloomy
darkness
were
not
as
dark
and
gloomy
as
the
thoughts
of
a
man
who
was
a
prisoner
in
one
of
the
rooms
of
his
own
palace
against
a
fluted
column
the
sultan
stood
watching
night
settle
on
the
lake
a
night
that
would
soon
settle
on
him
for
ever
the
day
had
gone
against
him
outmatched
he
had
been
driven
back
to
his
city
walls
even
then
he
could
have
escaped
with
a
handful
of
his
following
and
have
started
life
afresh
as
a
desert
marauder
but
there
was
one
treasure
in
his
palace
the
greatest
treasure
of
his
life
that
he
wanted
to
take
with
him
in
a
vain
effort
to
secure
pansy
before
he
fled
he
had
been
captured
with
his
enemies
close
at
his
heels
he
had
made
a
dash
for
the
palace
to
fetch
the
girl
on
arriving
outside
of
her
prison
he
found
a
fall
of
masonry
had
blocked
the
doorway
before
he
could
retrace
his
steps
and
try
another
entrance
his
pursuers
were
upon
him
the
french
were
already
in
possession
of
that
part
of
the
city
where
the
englishmen
had
been
imprisoned
immediately
they
were
released
sir
george
barclay
and
his
officers
supplemented
by
a
few
senegalese
soldiers
had
gone
to
the
palace
to
pansy
rescue
there
they
had
found
the
sultan
a
brief
struggle
against
overpowering
odds
ensued
and
once
more
the
casim
ammeh
was
a
prisoner
in
the
hands
of
george
barclay
with
the
shadows
gathering
round
him
the
sultan
stood
in
white
burnoose
a
bitter
expression
on
his
arrogant
face
he
had
nothing
now
neither
wealth
nor
power
nor
his
kingdom
nor
the
girl
he
had
risked
all
for
in
a
vain
attempt
to
win
he
would
have
even
less
there
was
short
shrift
for
such
as
he
his
life
would
have
been
taken
from
him
a
life
that
had
become
empty
as
he
had
grown
older
and
pleasures
palled
until
pansy
had
come
into
it
filling
it
with
freshness
and
innocence
the
battle
between
them
was
over
at
last
death
would
end
it
his
death
a
european
entered
a
man
he
knew
george
barclay
the
man
he
hated
more
than
ever
the
man
responsible
for
his
capture
barclay
ordered
one
of
the
soldiers
to
light
the
lamp
then
he
dismissed
his
escort
there
were
half
a
dozen
senegalese
soldiers
mounting
guard
over
the
sultan
the
englishman
dismissed
them
also
leaving
himself
alone
with
the
prisoner
you
doing
a
bold
thing
barclay
leaving
the
two
of
us
together
like
this
the
sultan
remarked
it
will
give
me
great
pleasure
to
wring
your
neck
before
i
sent
the
way
of
my
father
as
if
to
carry
out
this
design
he
took
a
step
towards
the
governor
from
his
pocket
barclay
drew
out
a
few
sheets
of
faded
scented
paper
read
this
he
said
quietly
handing
them
to
the
prisoner
with
some
surprise
the
sultan
took
them
on
opening
the
letter
he
started
for
he
recognised
his
writing
as
he
read
on
his
bronzed
face
whitened
and
a
dazed
look
came
to
his
eyes
like
a
man
reeling
under
a
tremendous
blow
in
a
critical
but
not
unfriendly
manner
barclay
studied
his
companion
he
knew
now
why
the
sultan
of
differed
so
in
appearance
from
the
wild
people
he
ruled
on
reaching
pansy
he
had
had
annette
le
breton
letter
thrust
into
his
hands
his
daughter
had
had
no
greeting
for
him
only
wild
entreaties
for
him
to
save
the
sultan
when
barclay
read
the
tragic
confession
he
was
quite
ready
to
do
his
best
then
pansy
had
told
him
more
how
raoul
le
breton
was
the
man
she
loved
but
she
did
not
say
that
lucille
lemesurier
was
responsible
for
their
parting
she
led
her
father
to
believe
that
the
discovery
of
the
supposed
black
blood
in
her
lover
had
been
her
hole
in
the
floor
of
heaven
barclay
did
not
trouble
his
daughter
with
many
questions
it
was
enough
that
she
was
safe
what
was
more
he
knew
she
would
marry
the
man
of
her
choice
no
matter
what
obstacles
were
put
in
her
way
as
the
first
pansy
had
married
him
with
the
world
against
her
all
he
wanted
now
was
to
save
the
man
his
daughter
had
set
her
heart
on
that
death
should
not
blight
her
life
as
it
had
blighted
his
when
the
conflict
was
over
and
the
french
and
english
officers
met
again
barclay
had
shown
the
letter
to
the
commander
of
the
expeditionary
force
the
man
who
held
the
sultan
life
in
his
hand
the
officer
had
read
annette
le
breton
statement
through
in
silence
considering
the
contents
it
did
not
need
pansy
lovely
anxious
face
or
her
father
pleadings
to
make
him
promise
them
life
and
liberty
for
colonel
le
breton
son
more
he
could
not
promise
the
two
governments
would
want
an
indemnity
that
would
swallow
up
most
of
the
kingdom
of
but
his
life
was
all
pansy
wanted
his
life
and
to
be
at
his
side
when
the
blow
fell
for
a
blow
it
was
bound
to
be
to
a
man
as
proud
and
fierce
as
her
lover
a
shock
and
then
a
relief
as
raoul
le
breton
read
the
letter
his
old
world
crashed
in
ruins
about
him
now
he
understood
his
dead
mother
hatred
of
the
sultan
casim
her
endeavours
to
mould
him
on
european
lines
her
pleadings
and
entreaties
for
him
not
to
forget
the
white
side
that
poor
frail
tortured
little
mother
who
had
suffered
so
much
for
his
sake
his
hand
went
across
his
anguished
face
he
had
not
forgotten
the
white
side
he
had
done
worse
he
had
just
ignored
it
knowing
good
he
had
preferred
evil
he
had
gone
his
way
as
barbaric
and
licentious
as
the
savage
who
had
murdered
his
father
with
tortured
eyes
he
glanced
at
barclay
this
man
whom
he
had
hated
so
bitterly
for
sixteen
years
and
more
was
his
best
friend
not
his
enemy
for
barclay
had
shot
the
savage
chief
who
had
murdered
his
father
and
outraged
his
mother
like
a
whisper
through
the
chaos
surrounding
him
le
breton
heard
barclay
talking
telling
him
pansy
had
found
the
letter
on
account
of
its
contents
the
french
commander
was
not
going
to
push
the
case
against
him
he
would
be
given
his
life
and
freedom
but
an
indemnity
would
have
to
be
paid
and
the
price
would
leave
him
only
a
shadow
of
his
wealth
le
breton
knew
that
again
pansy
had
saved
his
worthless
life
for
worthless
it
seemed
judging
from
his
new
standpoint
i
owe
you
thanks
not
hatred
he
said
to
barclay
his
voice
hoarse
with
suffering
and
i
owe
you
thanks
too
the
governor
replied
my
daughter
tells
me
you
treated
her
with
every
kindness
and
consideration
it
seemed
to
le
breton
that
he
had
been
anything
but
kind
and
considerate
that
no
woman
could
forgive
such
dealings
as
his
had
been
with
her
he
had
taken
a
girl
used
to
a
free
and
active
life
and
had
shut
her
up
in
a
scented
sensual
prison
trying
to
make
her
fall
a
victim
to
himself
and
her
own
senses
until
she
had
grown
morbid
and
hysterical
seeking
death
in
preference
to
himself
and
the
sort
of
life
he
had
forced
her
to
lead
i
do
know
that
i
should
call
myself
exactly
kind
or
considerate
to
your
daughter
he
remarked
not
after
reading
this
letter
or
to
you
either
he
finished
i
would
worry
too
much
about
the
past
if
i
were
you
barclay
replied
you
plenty
of
time
ahead
of
you
to
good
in
le
breton
said
nothing
he
stayed
brooding
on
the
ruins
around
him
hating
himself
and
the
savage
chief
who
had
been
his
teacher
all
his
old
world
had
been
swept
away
from
him
lost
and
alone
he
would
have
to
start
afresh
according
to
new
lights
and
new
ideals
and
without
a
hand
to
guide
him
he
had
nothing
neither
wealth
nor
kingdom
not
his
pride
even
unknowingly
he
had
been
a
renegade
fighting
against
his
own
nation
he
was
utterly
broken
but
he
did
not
look
it
only
unutterably
dreary
as
he
pondered
on
his
past
life
he
realised
to
the
fullest
what
he
must
look
like
to
pansy
no
wonder
she
had
fought
against
her
love
for
him
any
decent
woman
would
he
did
not
hear
barclay
go
leaving
him
alone
with
his
thoughts
and
the
deepening
shadows
he
was
aware
of
nothing
except
his
own
wild
career
and
how
he
had
run
foul
of
all
white
ideals
the
door
opened
but
he
did
not
hear
that
either
he
was
too
full
of
suffering
and
repentance
then
another
whisper
penetrated
the
whirl
in
which
he
moved
raoul
a
girl
voice
said
gently
he
looked
at
pansy
as
a
man
dying
of
thirst
in
a
desert
would
look
at
a
mirage
of
lakes
and
fountains
a
vision
of
torturing
desire
that
he
knew
was
not
for
him
no
apologies
could
condone
for
his
behaviour
love
he
dared
not
mention
not
with
a
past
like
his
not
to
this
innocent
girl
pansy
came
to
his
side
stoop
down
a
bit
raoul
she
said
i
want
to
say
something
he
bent
his
dark
head
into
his
ear
i
love
you
was
whispered
shyly
as
it
had
been
that
night
months
ago
in
a
moonlit
garden
in
grand
canary
at
her
whispered
words
his
face
started
working
strangely
i
do
deserve
such
love
such
forgiveness
he
said
in
a
broken
voice
she
laughed
the
laughter
that
kept
tears
at
bay
and
slipping
her
arms
about
his
neck
and
kissed
the
lips
that
dared
not
touch
her
now
and
i
want
to
marry
you
at
once
i
want
to
be
with
you
always
at
her
words
his
arms
went
round
her
in
their
old
possessive
manner
then
he
remembered
that
all
his
wealth
had
been
swept
from
him
that
now
he
had
the
girl
he
had
nothing
left
to
give
her
i
nothing
to
offer
you
he
said
his
voice
bitter
except
a
love
that
not
worth
having
with
soft
gentle
hands
pansy
stroked
the
lines
of
bitterness
from
the
proud
face
that
watched
her
with
such
love
and
longing
you
can
have
all
that
mine
i
do
want
anything
but
you
he
kissed
the
lips
that
were
held
up
to
his
so
willingly
my
darling
help
me
to
grope
back
to
your
white
ways
he
said
his
voice
hoarse
with
emotion
you
wo
have
to
grope
you
got
there
last
night
when
you
my
reputation
and
nicely
and
quietly
like
a
good
boy
he
laughed
but
there
was
a
slight
catch
in
his
laughter
and
pressed
the
girl
closer
to
the
heart
she
could
always
ease
there
were
no
shadows
now
no
ruins
for
the
greatest
treasure
of
his
life
was
left
to
him

end

of
egypt
love
story
without
damaris
bowed
her
head
so
that
the
curls
danced
and
glistened
in
the
light
as
the
torrent
of
his
words
in
the
egyptian
tongue
swept
about
her
like
a
flood
hast
thou
come
to
me
in
love
thou
dove
from
the
nest
nay
what
knowest
thou
of
love
i
ask
it
not
of
thee
yet
but
the
seed
i
shall
plant
within
thee
shall
grow
in
the
passing
of
the
days
and
the
nights
and
the
months
and
the
years
until
it
is
as
a
grove
of
perfumed
flowers
which
shall
change
to
golden
fruit
ready
to
the
plucking
of
my
hand
he
pressed
her
little
hands
back
against
her
breast
so
that
the
light
fell
full
upon
her
face
and
he
held
her
thuswise
watching
the
colour
rise
and
fade
allah
he
whispered
allah
god
of
all
what
have
i
done
to
deserve
such
signs
of
thy
great
goodness
wilt
thou
love
me
he
laughed
gently
canst
thou
look
into
mine
eyes
and
shake
thy
golden
head
which
shall
be
pillowed
upon
my
heart
my
wife
the
mother
of
my
children
look
at
me
look
at
me
ah
thine
eyes
which
were
as
the
pools
of
lebanon
at
night
are
as
a
sea
of
love
thou
it
not
but
love
is
within
thee
for
me
thy
master
and
was
there
not
truth
in
what
he
said
may
there
not
have
been
love
in
the
heart
of
the
girl
not
maybe
the
love
which
stands
sweet
and
sturdy
like
the
stocky
hyacinth
to
bloom
afresh
no
matter
how
often
the
flowers
be
struck
or
the
leaves
be
bruised
from
the
humdrum
bulb
deep
in
the
soil
of
quiet
content
but
the
iridescent
love
of
youth
for
youth
with
its
passion
so
swift
so
sweet
a
love
like
the
which
hangs
over
the
door
in
the
dawn
which
is
to
the
sun
at
noon
which
scatters
its
petals
at
dusk
the
rose
she
has
filled
your
days
with
the
memory
of
her
fragrance
her
leaves
still
scent
the
night
from
out
the
sealed
crystal
vase
which
is
your
heart
but
an
you
would
attain
the
priceless
boon
of
peace
see
to
it
that
a
humdrum
bulb
be
planted
in
the
brown
which
is
your
home
and
because
of
this
love
of
youth
which
was
causing
her
heart
to
thud
and
the
blood
to
race
through
her
veins
she
did
not
withdraw
her
hands
when
he
held
and
kissed
them
and
pressed
his
forehead
upon
them
he
whispered
so
that
she
could
scarcely
hear
bud
of
innocence
ivory
tower
of
womanhood
temple
of
love
beloved
beloved
i
am
at
thy
feet
and
he
knelt
and
kissed
the
little
feet
in
the
heelless
little
slippers
then
rising
took
both
her
hands
and
led
her
to
the
door
and
his
eyes
were
filled
with
a
great
sadness
in
spite
of
the
joy
which
sang
in
his
heart
as
he
took
her
into
the
shelter
of
his
arms
i
love
thee
too
well
he
said
as
he
bent
and
kissed
the
riotous
curls
so
near
his
mouth
yes
i
love
thee
too
well
to
snatch
thee
even
as
a
hungry
dog
snatches
his
food
though
verily
i
be
more
near
to
starving
than
