the
last
of
the
chapter
i
a
talk
on
the
doorsteps
it
was
one
of
those
afternoons
in
late
april
which
are
as
mild
and
balmy
as
any
june
day
the
air
was
full
of
the
chirps
and
twitters
of
birds
and
of
sweet
indefinable
odors
from
and
cherry
and
pear
blossoms
the
wisterias
overhead
were
thickly
starred
with
pointed
sacs
growing
purpler
with
each
hour
which
would
be
flowers
before
long
the
hedges
were
quickening
into
life
the
long
pensile
and
the
hung
in
a
mist
of
fine
green
against
the
sky
and
delicious
smells
came
with
every
puff
of
wind
from
the
bed
of
white
violets
under
the
parlor
windows
katy
and
clover
carr
sitting
with
their
sewing
on
the
drew
in
with
every
breath
the
sense
of
spring
who
does
not
know
the
delightfulness
of
that
first
sitting
out
of
doors
after
a
long
confinement
it
seems
like
flinging
the
gauntlet
down
to
the
powers
of
cold
hope
and
renovation
are
in
the
air
life
has
conquered
death
and
to
the
happy
hearts
in
love
with
life
there
is
joy
in
the
victory
the
two
sisters
talked
busily
as
they
sewed
but
all
the
time
an
only
rapture
informed
their
senses
the
sympathy
of
that
which
is
immortal
in
human
souls
with
the
resurrection
of
natural
things
which
is
the
sure
pledge
of
immortality
it
was
nearly
a
year
since
katy
had
come
back
from
that
too
brief
journey
to
europe
with
ashe
and
amy
about
which
some
of
you
have
read
and
many
things
of
interest
to
the
carr
family
had
happened
during
the
interval
the
natchitoches
had
duly
arrived
in
new
york
in
october
and
presently
afterward
burnet
was
convulsed
by
the
appearance
of
a
tall
young
fellow
in
naval
uniform
and
the
announcement
of
katy
engagement
to
lieutenant
worthington
it
was
a
piece
of
news
which
interested
everybody
in
the
little
town
for
carr
was
a
universal
friend
and
favorite
for
a
time
he
had
been
the
only
physician
in
the
place
and
though
with
the
gradual
growth
of
population
two
or
three
younger
men
had
appeared
to
dispute
the
ground
with
him
they
were
forced
for
the
most
part
to
content
themselves
with
doctoring
the
new
arrivals
and
with
such
fragments
and
leavings
of
practice
as
carr
chose
to
intrust
to
them
none
of
the
old
established
families
would
consent
to
call
in
any
one
else
if
they
could
possibly
get
the
old
doctor
a
skilful
practitioner
who
is
at
the
same
time
a
wise
adviser
a
helpful
friend
and
an
agreeable
man
must
necessarily
command
a
wide
influence
carr
was
by
all
odds
and
far
away
as
our
english
cousins
would
express
it
the
most
popular
person
in
burnet
wanted
for
all
pleasant
occasions
and
doubly
wanted
for
all
painful
ones
so
the
news
of
katy
engagement
was
made
a
matter
of
personal
concern
by
a
great
many
people
and
caused
a
general
stir
partly
because
she
was
her
father
daughter
and
partly
because
she
was
herself
for
katy
had
won
many
friends
by
her
own
merit
so
long
as
ned
worthington
stayed
a
sort
of
tide
of
congratulation
and
sympathy
seemed
to
sweep
through
the
house
all
day
long
and
chrysanthemums
and
baskets
of
pears
and
the
beautiful
burnet
grapes
flooded
the
premises
and
the
rang
so
often
that
clover
threatened
to
leave
the
door
open
with
a
card
attached
walk
straight
in
is
in
the
parlor
everybody
wanted
to
see
and
know
katy
lover
and
to
have
him
as
a
guest
ten
a
week
would
scarcely
have
contented
had
the
limitations
of
mortal
weeks
permitted
such
a
thing
and
not
a
can
of
oysters
would
have
been
left
in
the
place
if
lieutenant
worthington
leave
had
lasted
three
days
longer
clover
and
elsie
loudly
complained
that
they
themselves
never
had
a
chance
to
see
him
for
whenever
he
was
not
driving
or
walking
with
katy
or
having
long
in
the
library
he
was
eating
muffins
somewhere
or
making
calls
on
old
ladies
whose
feelings
would
be
dreadfully
hurt
if
he
went
away
without
their
seeing
him
sisters
seem
to
come
off
worst
of
all
protested
johnnie
but
in
spite
of
their
lamentations
they
all
saw
enough
of
their
future
to
grow
fond
of
him
and
notwithstanding
some
natural
pangs
of
jealousy
at
having
to
share
katy
with
an
outsider
it
was
a
happy
visit
and
every
one
was
sorry
when
the
leave
of
absence
ended
and
ned
had
to
go
away
a
month
later
the
natchitoches
sailed
for
the
bahamas
it
was
to
be
a
six
months
cruise
only
and
on
her
return
she
was
for
a
while
to
make
part
of
the
home
squadron
this
furnished
a
good
opportunity
for
her
first
lieutenant
to
marry
so
it
was
agreed
that
the
wedding
should
take
place
in
june
and
katy
set
about
her
preparations
in
the
leisurely
and
simple
fashion
which
was
characteristic
of
her
she
had
no
ambition
for
a
great
and
desired
to
save
her
father
expense
so
her
outfit
as
compared
with
that
of
most
modern
brides
was
a
very
moderate
one
but
being
planned
and
mostly
made
at
home
it
necessarily
involved
thought
time
and
a
good
deal
of
personal
exertion
dear
little
clover
flung
herself
into
the
affair
with
even
more
interest
than
if
it
had
been
her
own
many
happy
mornings
that
winter
did
the
sisters
spend
together
over
their
dainty
stitches
and
white
seam
elsie
and
johnnie
were
good
now
and
could
help
in
many
ways
ashe
often
joined
them
even
amy
could
contribute
aid
in
the
plainer
sewing
and
thread
everybody
needles
but
the
most
daring
and
indefatigable
of
all
was
clover
who
never
swerved
in
her
determination
that
katy
things
should
be
as
nice
and
as
pretty
as
love
and
industry
combined
could
make
them
her
ideas
as
to
decoration
soared
far
beyond
katy
she
she
she
she
she
tucked
and
frilled
and
embroidered
and
generally
worked
her
fingers
off
while
the
bride
vainly
protested
that
all
this
finery
was
quite
unnecessary
and
that
simple
hems
and
a
little
hamburg
edging
would
answer
just
as
well
clover
merely
repeated
the
words
hamburg
edging
with
an
accent
of
scorn
and
went
straight
on
in
her
elected
way
as
each
article
received
its
last
touch
and
came
from
the
laundry
white
and
immaculate
it
was
folded
to
perfection
tied
with
a
narrow
blue
or
pale
ribbon
and
laid
aside
in
a
sacred
receptacle
known
as
the
wedding
bureau
the
handkerchiefs
grouped
in
dozens
were
strewn
with
dried
violets
and
to
make
them
sweet
and
sachets
of
orris
lay
among
the
linen
and
perfumes
as
of
araby
were
discernible
whenever
a
drawer
in
the
bureau
was
pulled
out
so
the
winter
passed
and
now
spring
was
come
and
the
two
girls
on
the
doorsteps
were
talking
about
the
wedding
which
seemed
very
near
now
tell
me
just
what
sort
of
an
affair
you
want
it
to
be
said
clover
it
seems
more
your
wedding
than
mine
you
have
worked
so
hard
for
it
replied
katy
you
might
give
your
ideas
first
my
ideas
are
not
very
distinct
it
only
lately
that
i
have
begun
to
think
about
it
at
all
there
has
been
so
much
to
do
i
like
to
have
you
have
a
beautiful
dress
and
a
great
many
and
everything
as
pretty
as
can
be
but
not
so
many
bridesmaids
as
cecy
because
there
is
always
such
a
fuss
in
getting
them
nicely
up
the
aisle
in
church
and
out
again
that
is
as
far
as
i
got
but
so
long
as
you
are
pleased
and
it
goes
off
well
i
do
care
exactly
how
it
is
managed
then
since
you
are
in
such
an
accommodating
frame
of
mind
it
seems
a
good
time
to
break
my
views
to
you
do
be
shocked
clovy
but
do
you
know
i
do
want
to
be
married
in
church
at
all
or
to
have
any
bridesmaids
or
anything
arranged
for
beforehand
particularly
i
should
like
things
to
be
simple
and
to
just
but
katy
you
ca
do
it
like
that
it
will
all
get
into
a
snarl
if
there
is
no
planning
beforehand
or
rehearsals
it
would
be
confused
and
horrid
i
do
see
why
it
would
be
confused
if
there
were
nothing
to
confuse
please
not
be
vexed
but
i
always
have
hated
the
ordinary
kind
of
wedding
with
its
fuss
and
worry
and
so
much
of
everything
and
just
like
all
the
other
weddings
and
the
bride
looking
tired
to
death
and
nobody
enjoying
it
a
bit
i
like
mine
to
be
different
and
more
more
real
i
want
any
show
or
processing
about
but
just
to
have
things
nice
and
pretty
and
all
the
people
i
love
and
who
love
me
to
come
to
it
and
nothing
cut
and
dried
and
nobody
tired
and
to
make
it
a
sort
of
dear
loving
occasion
with
leisure
to
realize
how
dear
it
is
and
what
it
all
means
do
you
think
it
would
really
be
nicer
in
that
way
well
yes
as
you
put
it
and
from
the
higher
standard
as
miss
inches
would
say
perhaps
it
would
still
bridesmaids
and
all
that
are
very
pretty
to
look
at
and
folks
will
be
surprised
if
you
do
have
them
never
mind
folks
remarked
the
irreverent
katy
i
do
care
a
button
for
that
argument
yes
bridesmaids
and
going
up
the
aisle
in
a
long
procession
and
all
the
rest
pretty
to
look
at
or
were
before
they
got
to
be
so
hackneyed
i
can
imagine
the
first
bridal
procession
up
the
aisle
of
some
early
cathedral
as
having
been
perfectly
beautiful
but
nowadays
when
the
butcher
and
baker
and
and
everybody
else
do
it
just
alike
the
custom
seems
to
me
to
have
lost
its
charm
i
never
did
enjoy
having
things
exactly
as
every
one
else
has
them
all
going
in
the
same
direction
like
a
flock
of
sheep
i
would
like
my
little
wedding
to
be
something
especially
my
own
there
was
a
poetical
meaning
in
those
old
customs
but
now
that
the
custom
has
swallowed
up
so
much
of
the
meaning
it
would
please
me
better
to
retain
the
meaning
and
drop
the
custom
i
see
what
you
mean
said
clover
not
quite
convinced
but
inclined
as
usual
to
admire
katy
and
think
that
whatever
she
meant
must
be
right
but
tell
me
a
little
more
you
mean
to
have
a
do
you
doubtfully
yes
indeed
have
you
thought
what
it
shall
be
do
you
recollect
that
beautiful
white
crape
shawl
of
mamma
which
papa
gave
me
two
years
ago
it
has
a
lovely
wreath
of
embroidery
round
it
and
it
came
to
me
the
other
day
that
it
would
make
a
charming
gown
with
white
surah
or
something
for
the
i
should
like
that
better
than
anything
new
because
mamma
used
to
wear
it
and
it
would
seem
as
if
she
were
here
still
helping
me
to
get
ready
do
you
think
so
it
is
a
lovely
idea
said
clover
the
tears
dimming
her
happy
blue
eyes
for
a
moment
and
just
like
you
yes
that
shall
be
the
dress
dear
mamma
shawl
it
will
please
papa
too
i
think
to
have
you
choose
it
i
thought
perhaps
it
would
said
katy
soberly
then
i
have
a
wide
white
watered
sash
which
aunt
izzy
gave
me
and
i
mean
to
have
that
worked
into
the
dress
somehow
i
should
like
to
wear
something
of
hers
too
for
she
was
really
good
to
us
when
we
were
little
and
all
that
long
time
that
i
was
ill
and
we
were
not
always
good
to
her
i
am
afraid
poor
aunt
izzy
what
troublesome
little
wretches
we
were
i
most
of
all
were
you
somehow
i
never
can
recollect
the
time
when
you
were
not
a
born
angel
i
am
afraid
i
do
remember
aunt
izzy
well
i
just
have
a
vague
memory
of
somebody
who
was
pretty
strict
and
cross
ah
you
never
had
a
back
and
needed
to
be
waited
on
night
and
day
or
you
would
recollect
a
great
deal
more
than
that
cousin
helen
helped
me
to
appreciate
what
aunt
izzy
really
was
by
the
way
one
of
the
two
things
i
have
set
my
heart
on
is
to
have
cousin
helen
come
to
my
wedding
it
would
be
lovely
if
she
could
do
you
suppose
there
is
any
chance
i
wrote
her
week
before
last
but
she
has
answered
yet
of
course
it
depends
on
how
she
is
but
the
accounts
from
her
have
been
pretty
good
this
year
what
is
the
other
thing
you
have
set
your
heart
on
you
said
the
other
is
that
rose
red
shall
be
here
and
little
rose
i
wrote
to
her
the
other
day
also
and
coaxed
hard
would
it
be
too
enchanting
you
know
how
we
have
always
longed
to
have
her
in
burnet
and
if
she
could
come
now
it
would
make
everything
twice
as
pleasant
katy
what
an
enchanting
thought
cried
clover
who
had
not
seen
rose
since
they
all
left
hillsover
it
would
be
the
greatest
lark
that
ever
was
to
have
the
roses
when
do
you
suppose
we
shall
hear
i
can
hardly
wait
i
am
in
such
a
hurry
to
have
her
say
but
suppose
she
says
i
wo
think
of
such
a
possibility
now
go
on
i
suppose
your
principles
do
preclude
a
on
the
contrary
they
include
a
great
deal
of
i
want
to
send
a
box
to
everybody
in
burnet
all
the
poor
people
i
mean
and
the
old
people
and
the
children
at
the
home
and
those
forlorn
creatures
at
the
and
all
papa
patients
but
katy
that
will
cost
a
lot
objected
the
thrifty
clover
i
know
it
so
we
must
do
it
in
the
cheapest
way
and
make
the
cake
ourselves
i
have
aunt
izzy
recipe
which
is
a
very
good
one
and
if
we
all
take
hold
it
wo
be
such
an
immense
piece
of
work
debby
has
quantities
of
raisins
stoned
already
she
has
been
doing
them
in
the
evenings
a
few
at
a
time
for
the
last
month
ashe
knows
a
factory
where
you
can
get
the
little
white
boxes
for
ten
dollars
a
thousand
and
i
have
commissioned
her
to
send
for
five
hundred
five
hundred
what
an
immense
quantity
yes
but
there
are
all
the
hillsover
girls
to
be
remembered
and
all
our
kith
and
kin
and
everybody
at
the
wedding
will
want
one
i
do
think
it
will
be
too
many
oh
i
have
arranged
it
all
in
my
mind
johnnie
will
slice
the
citron
elsie
will
wash
the
currants
debby
measure
and
bake
alexander
mix
you
and
i
will
attend
to
the
icing
and
all
of
us
will
cut
it
up
alexander
alexander
he
is
quite
pleased
with
the
idea
and
has
constructed
an
implement
a
sort
of
spade
cut
out
of
new
pine
wood
for
the
purpose
he
says
it
will
be
a
sight
easier
than
digging
we
will
set
about
it
next
week
for
the
cake
improves
by
keeping
and
as
it
is
the
heaviest
job
we
have
to
do
it
will
be
well
to
get
it
out
of
the
way
early
you
have
a
floral
bell
or
a
bower
to
stand
in
or
something
of
that
kind
ventured
clover
timidly
indeed
i
shall
not
replied
katy
i
particularly
dislike
floral
bells
and
bowers
they
are
next
worst
to
anchors
and
harps
and
and
all
the
rest
of
the
dreadful
things
that
they
have
at
funerals
no
we
will
have
plenty
of
fresh
flowers
but
not
in
stiff
arrangements
i
want
it
all
to
seem
easy
and
to
easy
do
look
so
disgusted
clovy
oh
i
not
disgusted
it
your
wedding
i
want
you
to
have
everything
in
your
own
way
it
everybody
wedding
i
think
said
katy
tenderly
everybody
is
so
kind
about
it
did
you
see
the
thing
that
polly
sent
this
morning
no
it
must
have
come
after
i
went
out
what
was
it
seven
yards
of
beautiful
nun
lace
which
she
bought
in
florence
she
says
it
is
to
trim
a
morning
dress
but
it
really
too
pretty
how
dear
polly
is
she
sends
me
something
almost
every
day
i
seem
to
be
in
her
thoughts
all
the
time
it
is
because
she
loves
ned
so
much
of
course
but
it
is
just
as
kind
of
her
i
think
she
loves
you
almost
as
much
as
ned
said
clover
oh
she
could
do
that
ned
is
her
only
brother
there
is
amy
at
the
gate
now
it
was
a
much
taller
amy
than
had
come
home
from
italy
the
year
before
who
was
walking
toward
them
under
the
budding
roman
fever
had
seemed
to
quicken
and
stimulate
all
amy
powers
and
she
had
grown
very
fast
during
the
past
year
her
face
was
as
frank
and
childlike
as
ever
and
her
eyes
as
blue
but
she
was
prettier
than
when
she
went
to
europe
for
her
cheeks
were
pink
and
the
mane
of
waving
hair
which
framed
them
in
was
very
becoming
the
hair
was
just
long
enough
now
to
touch
her
shoulders
it
was
turning
brown
as
it
lengthened
but
the
ends
of
the
locks
still
shone
with
childish
gold
and
caught
the
sun
in
little
shining
rings
as
it
filtered
down
through
the
tree
branches
she
kissed
clover
several
times
and
gave
katy
a
long
close
hug
then
she
produced
a
parcel
daintily
hid
in
silver
paper
tanta
she
said
this
was
a
pet
name
lately
invented
for
katy
here
is
something
for
you
from
mamma
it
something
quite
particular
i
think
for
mamma
cried
when
she
was
writing
the
note
not
a
hard
cry
you
know
but
just
two
little
tears
in
her
eyes
she
kept
smiling
though
and
she
looked
happy
so
i
guess
it
is
anything
very
bad
she
said
i
was
to
give
it
to
you
with
her
best
love
katy
opened
the
parcel
and
beheld
a
square
veil
of
beautiful
old
blonde
the
note
said
this
was
my
dearest
katy
and
my
mother
wore
it
before
me
it
has
been
laid
aside
all
these
years
with
the
idea
that
perhaps
amy
might
want
it
some
day
but
instead
i
send
it
to
you
without
whom
there
would
be
no
amy
to
wear
this
or
anything
else
i
think
it
would
please
ned
to
see
it
on
your
head
and
i
know
it
would
make
me
very
happy
but
if
you
feel
like
using
it
do
mind
for
a
moment
saying
so
to
your
loving
polly
illustration
katy
opened
the
parcel
and
beheld
a
square
veil
of
beautiful
old
blonde
katy
handed
the
note
silently
to
clover
and
laid
her
face
for
a
little
while
among
the
soft
folds
of
the
lace
about
which
a
faint
odor
of
roses
hung
like
the
breath
of
and
unforgotten
loves
and
affections
shall
you
queried
clover
softly
why
of
course
does
it
seem
too
sweet
both
our
mothers
there
cried
amy
you
are
going
to
cry
too
tanta
i
thought
weddings
were
nice
funny
things
i
never
supposed
they
made
people
feel
badly
i
ever
let
mabel
get
married
i
think
but
she
have
to
stay
a
little
girl
always
in
that
case
for
i
certainly
wo
have
her
an
old
maid
what
do
you
know
about
old
maids
midget
asked
clover
why
miss
clover
i
have
seen
lots
of
them
there
was
that
one
at
the
pension
suisse
you
remember
tanta
and
the
two
on
the
steamer
when
we
came
home
and
there
miss
fitz
who
made
my
blue
frock
ellen
said
she
was
a
regular
old
maid
i
never
mean
to
let
mabel
be
like
that
i
do
think
there
the
least
danger
remarked
katy
glancing
at
the
inseparable
mabel
who
was
perched
on
amy
arm
and
who
did
not
look
a
day
older
than
she
had
done
eighteen
months
previously
amy
we
going
to
make
next
week
heaps
and
heaps
of
you
want
to
come
and
help
why
of
course
i
do
what
fun
which
day
may
i
come
the
did
really
turn
out
fun
many
hands
made
light
work
of
what
would
have
been
a
formidable
job
for
one
or
two
it
was
all
done
gradually
johnnie
cut
the
golden
citron
quarters
into
thin
transparent
slices
in
the
one
morning
while
the
others
were
sewing
and
reading
tennyson
aloud
elsie
and
amy
made
a
regular
frolic
of
the
katy
with
debby
assistance
weighed
and
measured
and
the
mixture
was
enthusiastically
stirred
by
alexander
with
the
spade
which
he
had
invented
in
a
large
new
then
came
the
baking
which
for
two
days
filled
the
house
with
spicy
odors
then
the
great
feat
of
icing
the
big
square
loaves
and
then
the
cutting
up
in
which
all
took
part
there
was
much
careful
measurement
that
the
slices
might
be
an
exact
fit
and
the
kitchen
rang
with
bright
laughter
and
chat
as
katy
and
clover
wielded
the
sharp
and
the
others
fitted
the
portions
into
their
boxes
and
tied
the
ribbons
in
crisp
little
bows
many
delicious
crumbs
and
odd
corners
and
fragments
fell
to
the
share
of
the
younger
workers
and
altogether
the
occasion
struck
amy
as
so
enjoyable
that
she
announced
with
her
mouth
full
that
she
had
changed
her
mind
and
that
mabel
might
get
married
as
often
as
she
pleased
if
she
would
have
cake
like
every
time
a
liberality
of
permission
which
mabel
listened
to
with
her
invariable
waxen
smile
when
all
was
over
and
the
last
ribbons
tied
the
hundreds
of
little
boxes
were
stacked
in
careful
piles
on
a
shelf
of
the
inner
closet
of
the
doctor
office
to
wait
till
they
were
wanted
an
arrangement
which
naughty
clover
pronounced
eminently
suitable
since
there
should
always
be
a
doctor
close
at
hand
where
there
was
so
much
but
before
all
this
was
accomplished
came
what
katy
in
imitation
of
one
of
miss
edgeworth
heroines
called
the
day
of
happy
letters
chapter
ii
the
day
of
happy
letters
the
arrival
of
the
morning
boat
with
letters
and
newspapers
from
the
east
was
the
great
event
of
the
day
in
burnet
it
was
due
at
eleven
and
everybody
consciously
or
unconsciously
was
on
the
lookout
for
it
the
gentlemen
were
at
the
office
bright
and
early
and
stood
chatting
with
each
other
and
fingering
the
keys
of
their
little
drawers
till
the
rattle
of
the
shutter
announced
that
the
mail
was
distributed
their
wives
and
daughters
at
home
meanwhile
were
equally
in
a
state
of
expectation
and
whatever
they
might
be
doing
kept
ears
and
eyes
on
the
alert
for
the
step
on
the
gravel
and
the
click
of
the
latch
which
betokened
the
arrival
of
the
family
doctors
can
not
command
their
time
like
other
people
and
carr
was
often
detained
by
his
patients
and
made
late
for
the
mail
so
it
was
all
the
pleasanter
a
surprise
when
on
the
great
day
of
the
he
came
in
earlier
than
usual
with
his
hands
quite
full
of
letters
and
parcels
all
the
girls
made
a
rush
for
him
at
once
but
he
fended
them
off
with
an
elbow
while
with
teasing
slowness
he
read
the
addresses
on
the
envelopes
miss
carr
miss
carr
miss
katherine
carr
miss
carr
again
four
for
you
katy
carr
a
bill
and
a
newspaper
i
perceive
all
that
an
old
country
doctor
with
a
daughter
about
to
be
married
ought
to
expect
i
suppose
miss
clover
carr
one
for
the
in
white
linen
here
take
it
clovy
miss
carr
again
katy
you
have
the
lion
share
miss
joanna
carr
in
the
unmistakable
handwriting
of
miss
inches
miss
katherine
carr
care
carr
that
looks
like
a
wedding
present
katy
miss
elsie
carr
cecy
hand
i
should
say
miss
carr
once
more
from
the
conquering
hero
judging
from
the
carr
another
newspaper
and
hollo
one
more
for
miss
carr
well
children
i
hope
for
once
you
are
satisfied
with
the
amount
of
your
correspondence
my
arm
fairly
aches
with
the
weight
of
it
i
hope
the
letters
are
not
so
heavy
inside
as
out
i
am
quite
satisfied
papa
thank
you
said
katy
looking
up
with
a
happy
smile
from
ned
letter
which
she
had
torn
open
first
of
all
are
you
going
dear
she
laid
her
packages
down
to
help
him
on
with
his
coat
katy
never
forgot
her
father
yes
i
am
going
time
and
rheumatism
wait
for
no
man
you
can
tell
me
your
news
when
i
come
back
it
is
not
fair
to
peep
into
love
letters
so
i
will
only
say
of
ned
that
it
was
very
long
very
entertaining
katy
thought
and
contained
the
pleasant
information
that
the
natchitoches
was
to
sail
four
days
after
it
was
posted
and
would
reach
new
york
a
week
sooner
than
any
one
had
dared
to
hope
the
letter
contained
several
other
things
as
well
which
showed
katy
how
continually
she
had
been
in
his
thoughts
a
painting
on
rice
paper
a
dried
flower
or
two
a
couple
of
little
sketches
of
the
harbor
of
santa
lucia
and
the
shipping
and
a
small
cravat
of
an
odd
convent
lace
folded
very
flat
and
smooth
altogether
it
was
a
delightful
letter
and
katy
read
it
as
it
were
in
leaps
her
eyes
catching
at
the
salient
points
and
leaving
the
details
to
be
dwelt
upon
when
she
should
be
alone
this
done
she
thrust
the
letter
into
her
pocket
and
proceeded
to
examine
the
others
the
first
was
in
cousin
helen
clear
beautiful
handwriting
dear
katy
if
any
one
had
told
us
ten
years
ago
that
in
this
particular
year
of
grace
you
would
be
getting
ready
to
be
married
and
i
preparing
to
come
to
your
wedding
i
think
we
should
have
listened
with
some
incredulity
as
to
an
agreeable
fairy
tale
which
could
not
possibly
come
true
we
did
look
much
like
it
did
we
you
in
your
big
chair
and
i
on
my
sofa
yet
here
we
are
when
your
letter
first
reached
me
it
seemed
a
sort
of
impossible
thing
that
i
should
accept
your
invitation
but
the
more
i
thought
about
it
the
more
i
felt
as
if
i
must
and
now
things
seem
to
be
working
round
to
that
end
quite
marvellously
i
have
had
a
good
winter
but
the
doctor
wishes
me
to
try
the
experiment
of
the
water
cure
again
which
benefited
me
so
much
the
summer
of
your
accident
this
brings
me
in
your
direction
and
i
do
see
why
i
might
not
come
a
little
earlier
than
i
otherwise
should
and
have
the
great
pleasure
of
seeing
you
married
and
making
acquaintance
with
lieutenant
worthington
that
is
if
you
are
perfectly
sure
that
to
have
at
so
busy
a
time
a
guest
who
like
the
queen
of
spain
has
the
disadvantage
of
being
without
legs
will
not
be
more
care
than
enjoyment
think
seriously
over
this
point
and
do
send
for
me
unless
you
are
certain
meanwhile
i
am
making
ready
alex
and
emma
and
little
helen
who
is
a
pretty
big
helen
now
are
to
be
my
escorts
as
far
as
buffalo
on
their
way
to
niagara
after
that
is
all
plain
sailing
and
jane
carter
and
i
can
manage
very
well
for
ourselves
it
seems
like
a
dream
to
think
that
i
may
see
you
all
so
soon
but
it
is
such
a
pleasant
one
that
i
would
not
wake
up
on
any
account
i
have
a
little
gift
which
i
shall
bring
you
myself
my
katy
but
i
have
a
fancy
also
that
you
shall
wear
some
trifling
thing
on
your
which
comes
from
me
so
for
fear
of
being
forestalled
i
will
say
now
please
do
buy
any
stockings
for
the
occasion
but
wear
the
pair
which
go
with
this
for
the
sake
of
your
loving
cousin
helen
these
must
be
they
cried
elsie
pouncing
on
one
of
the
little
packages
may
i
cut
the
string
katy
permission
was
granted
and
elsie
cut
the
string
it
was
indeed
a
pair
of
beautiful
white
silk
stockings
embroidered
in
an
open
pattern
and
far
finer
than
anything
which
katy
would
have
thought
of
choosing
for
herself
do
they
look
exactly
like
cousin
helen
she
said
fondling
them
her
things
always
are
choicer
and
prettier
than
anybody
else
somehow
i
ca
think
how
she
does
it
when
she
never
by
any
chance
goes
into
a
shop
who
can
this
be
from
i
wonder
this
was
the
second
little
package
it
proved
to
contain
a
small
volume
bound
in
white
and
gold
entitled
advice
to
brides
on
the
appeared
this
inscription
to
katherine
carr
on
the
occasion
of
her
approaching
bridal
from
her
affectionate
teacher
marianne
nipson
timothy
ii
clover
at
once
ran
to
fetch
her
testament
that
she
might
verify
the
quotation
and
announced
with
a
shriek
of
laughter
that
it
was
let
the
women
learn
in
silence
with
all
subjection
while
katy
much
diverted
read
extracts
casually
selected
from
the
work
such
as
a
wife
should
receive
her
husband
decree
without
cavil
or
question
remembering
that
the
husband
is
the
head
of
the
wife
and
that
in
all
matters
of
dispute
his
opinion
naturally
and
scripturally
outweighs
her
own
or
soft
answer
turneth
away
wrath
if
your
husband
comes
home
fretted
and
impatient
do
not
answer
him
sharply
but
soothe
him
with
gentle
words
and
caresses
strict
attention
to
the
minor
details
of
domestic
management
will
often
avail
to
secure
peace
and
again
keep
in
mind
the
epitaph
raised
in
honor
of
an
exemplary
wife
of
the
last
century
never
banged
the
door
qualify
yourself
for
a
similar
testimonial
tanta
never
does
bang
doors
remarked
amy
who
had
come
in
as
this
last
elegant
extract
was
being
read
no
that
true
she
does
said
clover
her
prevailing
vice
is
to
leave
them
open
i
like
that
truth
about
a
good
dinner
to
secure
peace
and
the
advice
to
your
bear
when
he
is
at
his
crossest
ned
never
does
issue
though
i
fancy
and
on
the
whole
katy
i
do
believe
nipson
present
is
going
to
be
any
particular
comfort
in
your
future
trials
do
read
something
else
to
take
the
taste
out
of
our
mouths
we
will
listen
in
subjection
katy
was
already
deep
in
a
long
epistle
from
rose
this
is
too
delicious
she
said
do
listen
and
she
began
again
at
the
beginning
my
sweetest
of
all
old
sweets
come
to
your
wedding
of
course
i
shall
it
would
never
seem
to
me
to
have
any
legal
sanction
whatever
if
i
were
not
there
to
add
my
blessing
only
let
me
know
which
day
early
in
june
it
is
to
be
that
i
may
make
ready
deniston
will
fetch
us
on
and
by
a
special
piece
of
good
luck
a
man
in
chicago
whose
name
i
shall
always
bless
if
only
i
can
remember
what
it
is
has
been
instigated
by
our
mutual
good
angel
to
want
him
on
business
just
about
that
time
so
that
he
would
have
to
go
west
anyway
and
would
rather
have
me
along
than
not
and
is
perfectly
resigned
to
his
fate
i
mean
to
come
three
days
before
and
stay
three
days
after
the
wedding
if
i
may
and
altogether
it
is
going
to
be
a
lark
of
larks
little
rose
can
talk
quite
fluently
now
and
almost
read
that
is
she
knows
six
letters
of
her
picture
alphabet
she
composes
poems
also
the
other
day
she
suddenly
announced
mamma
i
have
made
up
a
sort
of
a
im
may
i
say
it
to
you
i
naturally
consented
and
this
was
the
im
jump
in
the
parlor
jump
in
the
hall
god
made
us
all
now
did
you
ever
hear
of
anything
quite
so
dear
as
that
for
a
baby
only
three
years
and
five
months
old
i
tell
you
she
is
a
wonder
you
will
all
adore
her
clover
particularly
oh
my
dear
little
to
think
i
am
going
to
see
her
i
met
both
ellen
gray
and
esther
dearborn
the
other
day
and
where
do
you
think
it
was
at
mary
silver
wedding
yes
she
is
actually
married
to
the
rev
charles
playfair
strothers
and
settled
in
a
little
parsonage
somewhere
in
the
hoosac
tunnel
or
near
it
and
already
immersed
in
duties
i
think
what
arguments
he
used
to
screw
her
up
to
the
rash
act
but
there
she
is
it
was
exactly
what
one
would
call
a
cheerful
wedding
all
the
connection
took
it
very
seriously
and
mary
uncle
who
married
her
preached
quite
a
lengthy
funeral
discourse
to
the
young
couple
and
got
them
nicely
ready
for
death
burial
and
the
next
world
before
he
would
consent
to
unite
them
for
this
he
was
a
old
person
who
had
been
a
missionary
and
had
laid
away
three
dear
wives
in
foreign
lands
as
he
confided
to
me
afterward
over
a
plate
of
he
seemed
to
me
to
be
taking
notice
as
they
say
of
babies
and
it
is
barely
possible
that
he
mistook
me
for
a
single
woman
for
his
attentions
were
rather
pronounced
till
i
introduced
my
husband
prominently
into
conversation
after
that
he
seemed
more
attracted
by
ellen
gray
mary
cried
straight
through
the
ceremony
in
fact
i
imagine
she
cried
straight
through
the
engagement
for
her
eyes
looked
wept
out
and
had
scarlet
rims
and
she
was
as
white
as
her
veil
in
fact
whiter
for
that
was
made
of
beautiful
de
and
was
just
a
trifle
yellowish
everybody
cried
her
mother
and
sister
sobbed
aloud
so
did
several
maiden
aunts
and
a
grandmother
or
two
and
a
few
cousins
the
church
resounded
with
guggles
and
gasps
like
a
great
deal
of
running
out
of
an
tub
silver
also
wept
as
a
business
man
may
in
a
series
of
sniffs
interspersed
with
silk
handkerchief
you
know
the
kind
altogether
it
was
a
most
cheerless
affair
i
seemed
to
be
the
only
person
present
who
was
not
in
tears
but
i
really
did
see
anything
to
cry
about
so
far
as
i
was
concerned
though
i
felt
very
i
had
to
go
alone
for
deniston
was
in
new
york
i
got
to
the
church
rather
early
and
my
new
spring
bonnet
which
is
a
superior
one
seemed
to
impress
the
ushers
so
they
put
me
in
a
very
distinguished
front
pew
all
by
myself
i
bore
my
honors
meekly
and
found
them
quite
agreeable
in
fact
you
know
i
always
did
like
to
be
made
much
of
so
you
can
imagine
my
disgust
when
presently
three
of
the
stoutest
ladies
you
ever
saw
came
sailing
up
the
aisle
and
prepared
to
invade
pew
please
move
up
madam
said
the
fattest
of
all
who
wore
a
wonderful
yellow
hat
but
i
was
not
raised
at
hillsover
for
nothing
and
remembering
the
success
of
our
little
ruse
on
the
railroad
train
long
ago
i
stepped
out
into
the
aisle
and
with
my
sweetest
smile
made
room
for
them
to
pass
perhaps
i
would
better
keep
the
seat
next
the
door
i
murmured
to
the
yellow
lady
in
case
an
attack
should
come
on
an
attack
she
repeated
in
an
accent
of
alarm
she
whispered
to
the
others
all
three
eyed
me
suspiciously
while
i
stood
looking
as
pensive
and
suffering
as
i
could
then
after
confabulating
together
for
a
little
they
all
swept
into
the
seat
behind
mine
and
i
heard
them
speculating
in
low
tones
as
to
whether
it
was
epilepsy
or
catalepsy
or
convulsions
that
i
was
subject
to
i
presume
they
made
signs
to
all
the
other
people
who
came
in
to
steer
clear
of
the
lady
with
fits
for
nobody
invaded
my
privacy
and
i
sat
in
lonely
splendor
with
a
pew
to
myself
and
was
very
comfortable
indeed
mary
dress
was
white
satin
with
a
great
deal
of
point
lace
and
pearl
passementerie
and
she
wore
a
pair
of
diamond
which
her
father
gave
her
and
a
bouquet
almost
but
not
quite
as
large
which
was
the
gift
of
the
bridegroom
he
has
a
nice
face
and
i
think
silvery
mary
will
be
happy
with
him
much
happier
than
with
her
rather
dismal
family
though
his
salary
is
only
fifteen
hundred
a
year
and
pearl
passementerie
i
believe
quite
unknown
and
useless
in
the
hoosac
region
she
had
loads
of
the
most
beautiful
presents
you
ever
saw
all
the
silvers
are
rolling
in
riches
you
know
one
little
thing
made
me
laugh
for
it
was
so
like
her
when
the
clergyman
said
mary
wilt
thou
take
this
man
to
be
thy
wedded
husband
i
distinctly
saw
her
put
her
fingers
over
her
mouth
in
the
old
frightened
way
it
was
only
for
a
second
and
after
that
i
rather
think
strothers
held
her
hand
tight
for
fear
she
might
do
it
again
she
sent
her
love
to
you
katy
what
sort
of
a
gown
are
going
to
have
by
the
way
i
have
kept
my
best
news
to
the
last
which
is
that
deniston
has
at
last
given
way
and
we
are
to
move
into
town
in
october
we
have
taken
a
little
house
in
west
cedar
street
it
is
quite
small
and
very
dingy
and
i
presume
inconvenient
but
i
already
love
it
to
distraction
and
feel
as
if
i
should
sit
up
all
night
for
the
first
month
to
enjoy
the
sensation
of
being
no
longer
that
horrid
thing
a
resident
of
the
suburbs
i
hunt
the
paper
shops
and
collect
samples
of
odd
and
occult
pattern
and
compare
them
with
carpets
and
am
altogether
in
my
element
only
longing
for
the
time
to
come
when
i
may
put
together
my
pots
and
pans
and
betake
me
across
the
meantime
roslein
is
living
in
a
state
of
quarantine
she
is
not
permitted
to
speak
with
any
other
children
or
even
to
look
out
of
window
at
one
for
fear
she
may
contract
some
sort
of
contagious
disease
and
spoil
our
beautiful
visit
to
burnet
she
sends
you
a
kiss
and
so
do
i
and
mother
and
sylvia
and
deniston
and
grandmamma
particularly
desire
their
love
your
loving
rose
red
oh
cried
clover
catching
katy
round
the
waist
and
waltzing
wildly
about
the
room
what
a
delicious
letter
what
fun
we
are
going
to
have
it
seems
too
good
to
be
true
keep
step
katy
i
forgive
you
for
the
first
time
for
getting
married
i
never
did
before
really
and
truly
i
am
so
happy
that
i
must
dance
there
go
my
letters
said
katy
as
with
the
last
rapid
twirl
epistle
and
the
advice
to
brides
flew
to
right
and
left
there
go
two
of
your
clover
oh
do
stop
we
shall
all
be
in
pieces
clover
brought
her
gyrations
to
a
close
by
landing
her
unwilling
partner
suddenly
on
the
sofa
then
with
a
last
squeeze
and
a
rapid
kiss
she
began
to
pick
up
the
scattered
letters
now
read
the
rest
she
commanded
though
anything
else
will
sound
flat
after
rose
hear
this
first
said
elsie
who
had
taken
advantage
of
the
pause
to
open
her
own
letter
it
is
from
cecy
and
she
says
she
is
coming
to
spend
a
month
with
her
mother
on
purpose
to
be
here
for
katy
wedding
she
sends
heaps
of
love
to
you
katy
and
says
she
only
hopes
that
worthington
will
prove
as
perfectly
satisfactory
in
all
respects
as
her
own
dear
sylvester
my
gracious
i
should
hope
he
would
put
in
clover
who
was
still
in
the
wildest
spirits
what
a
dear
old
goose
cecy
is
i
never
hankered
in
the
least
for
sylvester
slack
did
you
katy
certainly
not
it
would
be
a
most
improper
proceeding
if
i
had
replied
katy
with
a
laugh
whom
do
you
think
this
letter
is
from
girls
do
listen
to
it
it
written
by
that
nice
old
allen
beach
whom
we
met
in
london
do
you
recollect
my
telling
you
about
him
my
dear
miss
carr
our
friends
in
harley
street
have
told
me
a
piece
of
news
concerning
you
which
came
to
them
lately
in
a
letter
from
ashe
and
i
hope
you
will
permit
me
to
offer
you
my
most
sincere
congratulations
and
good
wishes
i
recollect
meeting
lieutenant
worthington
when
he
was
here
two
years
ago
and
liking
him
very
much
one
is
always
glad
in
a
foreign
land
to
be
able
to
show
so
good
a
specimen
of
one
young
countrymen
as
he
affords
not
that
england
need
be
counted
as
a
foreign
country
by
any
american
and
least
of
all
by
myself
who
have
found
it
a
true
home
for
so
many
years
as
a
little
souvenir
of
our
week
of
together
of
which
i
retain
most
agreeable
remembrances
i
have
sent
you
by
my
friends
the
sawyers
who
sail
for
america
shortly
a
copy
of
hare
walks
in
london
which
a
young
of
mine
has
for
the
past
year
been
illustrating
with
photographs
of
the
many
curious
old
buildings
described
you
took
so
much
interest
in
them
while
here
that
i
hope
you
may
like
to
see
them
again
will
you
please
accept
with
it
my
most
cordial
wishes
for
your
future
and
believe
me
very
faithfully
your
friend
allen
beach
what
a
nice
letter
said
clover
is
it
replied
katy
with
shining
eyes
what
a
thing
it
is
to
be
a
gentleman
and
to
know
how
to
say
and
do
things
in
the
right
way
i
am
so
surprised
and
pleased
that
beach
should
remember
me
i
never
supposed
he
would
he
sees
so
many
people
in
london
all
the
time
and
it
is
quite
a
long
time
since
we
were
there
nearly
two
years
was
your
letter
from
miss
inches
john
yes
and
mamma
marian
sends
you
her
love
and
there
a
present
coming
by
express
for
you
some
sort
of
a
book
with
a
hard
name
i
can
scarcely
make
it
out
the
ru
ru
something
of
omar
kay
y
well
anyway
it
a
book
and
she
hopes
you
will
read
emerson
on
friendship
over
before
you
are
married
because
it
a
helpful
utterance
and
adjusts
the
mind
to
mutual
conditions
worse
than
timothy
ii
muttered
clover
well
katy
dear
what
next
what
you
laughing
at
you
will
never
guess
i
am
sure
this
is
a
letter
from
miss
jane
and
she
has
made
me
this
pincushion
the
pincushion
was
of
a
familiar
type
two
circles
of
pasteboard
covered
with
gray
silk
neatly
together
and
stuck
with
a
row
of
closely
fitting
pins
miss
jane
note
ran
as
follows
hillsover
april
dear
katy
i
hear
from
nipson
that
you
are
to
be
married
shortly
and
i
want
to
say
that
you
have
my
best
wishes
for
your
future
i
think
a
man
ought
to
be
happy
who
has
you
for
a
wife
i
only
hope
the
one
you
have
chosen
is
worthy
of
you
probably
he
is
but
perhaps
you
wo
find
it
out
life
is
a
knotty
problem
for
most
of
us
may
you
solve
it
satisfactorily
to
yourself
and
others
i
have
nothing
to
send
but
my
good
wishes
and
a
few
pins
they
are
not
an
unlucky
present
i
believe
as
scissors
are
said
to
be
remember
me
to
your
sister
and
believe
me
to
be
with
true
regard
yours
jane
bangs
dear
me
is
that
her
name
cried
clover
i
always
supposed
she
was
baptized
jane
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
she
had
any
other
title
what
appropriate
initials
how
she
used
to
with
us
now
clovy
that
not
kind
it
a
very
nice
note
indeed
and
i
am
touched
by
it
it
a
beautiful
compliment
to
say
that
the
man
ought
to
be
happy
who
has
got
me
i
think
i
never
supposed
that
miss
jane
could
pay
a
compliment
or
make
a
joke
that
touch
about
the
scissors
is
really
jocose
for
miss
jane
rose
red
will
shriek
over
the
letter
and
that
particularly
rigid
pincushion
they
are
both
of
them
so
exactly
like
her
dear
me
only
one
letter
left
who
is
that
from
katy
how
fast
one
does
eat
up
pleasures
but
you
had
a
letter
yourself
surely
papa
said
so
what
was
that
you
have
read
it
to
us
no
for
it
contains
a
secret
which
you
are
not
to
hear
just
yet
replied
clover
brides
must
ask
questions
go
on
with
yours
mine
is
from
louisa
agnew
quite
a
long
one
too
it
an
age
since
we
heard
from
her
you
know
ashburn
april
dear
katy
your
delightful
letter
and
invitation
came
day
before
yesterday
and
thank
you
for
both
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
that
would
please
me
better
than
to
come
to
your
wedding
if
it
were
possible
but
it
simply
is
if
you
lived
in
new
haven
now
or
even
boston
but
burnet
is
so
dreadfully
far
off
it
seems
as
inaccessible
as
kamchatka
to
a
person
who
like
myself
has
a
house
to
keep
and
two
babies
to
take
care
of
do
look
so
alarmed
the
house
is
the
same
house
you
saw
when
you
were
here
and
so
is
one
of
the
babies
the
other
is
a
new
acquisition
just
two
years
old
and
as
great
a
darling
as
daisy
was
at
the
same
age
my
mother
has
been
really
better
in
health
since
he
came
but
just
now
she
is
at
a
sort
of
rest
cure
in
kentucky
and
i
have
my
hands
full
with
papa
and
the
children
as
you
can
imagine
so
i
ca
go
off
two
days
journey
to
a
wedding
not
even
to
yours
my
dearest
old
katy
i
shall
think
about
you
all
day
long
on
day
when
i
know
which
it
is
and
try
to
imagine
just
how
everything
looks
and
yet
i
find
that
quite
easy
for
somehow
i
fancy
that
your
wedding
will
be
a
little
different
from
the
common
run
you
always
were
different
from
other
people
to
me
you
know
you
and
clover
and
i
love
you
so
much
and
i
always
shall
papa
has
taken
a
portrait
of
me
in
oils
and
a
blue
dress
which
he
thinks
is
like
and
which
i
am
going
to
send
you
as
soon
as
it
comes
home
from
the
framers
i
hope
you
will
like
it
a
little
for
my
sake
dear
katy
i
send
so
much
love
with
it
i
have
only
seen
the
pages
in
the
street
since
they
came
home
from
europe
but
the
last
piece
of
news
here
is
engagement
to
comte
ernest
de
conflans
he
has
something
to
do
with
the
french
legation
in
washington
i
believe
and
they
crossed
in
the
same
steamer
i
saw
him
driving
with
her
the
other
day
a
little
man
not
handsome
and
very
dark
i
do
not
know
when
they
are
to
be
married
your
cousin
clarence
is
in
colorado
with
two
kisses
apiece
and
a
great
hug
for
you
katy
i
am
always
your
affectionate
friend
louisa
dear
me
said
the
insatiable
clover
is
that
the
very
last
i
wish
we
had
another
mail
and
twelve
more
letters
coming
in
at
once
what
a
blessed
institution
the
is
chapter
iii
the
first
wedding
in
the
family
the
great
job
of
the
over
a
sense
of
leisure
settled
on
the
house
there
seemed
nothing
left
to
be
done
which
need
put
any
one
out
of
his
or
her
way
particularly
katy
had
among
her
other
qualities
a
great
deal
of
what
is
called
forehandedness
to
leave
things
to
be
attended
to
at
the
last
moment
in
a
flurry
and
a
hurry
would
have
been
intolerable
to
her
she
firmly
believed
in
the
doctrine
of
a
certain
wise
man
of
our
own
day
who
says
that
to
push
your
work
before
you
is
easy
enough
but
to
pull
it
after
you
is
very
hard
indeed
all
that
winter
without
saying
much
about
it
for
katy
did
not
do
her
thinking
outside
her
head
she
had
been
gradually
making
ready
for
the
great
event
of
the
spring
little
by
little
a
touch
here
and
a
touch
there
matters
had
been
put
in
train
and
the
result
now
appeared
in
a
surprising
ease
of
mind
and
absence
of
confusion
the
house
had
received
its
spring
cleaning
a
fortnight
earlier
than
usual
and
was
in
fair
nice
order
with
carpets
and
curtains
dresses
were
ordered
betimes
and
had
come
home
been
tried
on
and
folded
away
ten
days
before
the
wedding
they
were
not
many
in
number
but
all
were
pretty
and
in
good
taste
for
the
frigate
was
to
be
in
bar
harbor
and
newport
for
a
part
of
the
summer
and
katy
wanted
to
do
ned
credit
and
look
well
in
his
eyes
and
those
of
his
friends
all
the
arrangements
kept
studiously
simple
were
beautifully
systematized
and
their
very
simplicity
made
them
easy
to
carry
out
the
guest
chambers
were
completely
ready
one
or
two
extra
helpers
were
engaged
that
the
servants
might
not
be
overworked
the
order
of
every
meal
for
the
three
busiest
days
was
settled
and
written
down
each
of
the
younger
sisters
had
some
special
charge
committed
to
her
elsie
was
to
wait
on
cousin
helen
and
see
that
she
and
her
nurse
had
everything
they
wanted
clover
was
to
care
for
the
two
roses
johnnie
to
oversee
the
table
arrangements
and
make
sure
that
all
was
right
in
that
direction
dear
little
amy
was
indefatigable
as
a
doer
of
errands
and
her
quick
feet
were
at
everybody
service
to
save
steps
cecy
arrived
and
haunted
the
house
all
day
long
anxious
to
be
of
use
to
somebody
ashe
put
her
time
at
their
disposal
there
was
such
a
superabundance
of
helpers
in
fact
that
no
one
could
feel
over
taxed
and
katy
while
still
serving
as
main
spring
to
the
whole
had
plenty
of
time
to
write
her
notes
open
her
wedding
presents
and
enjoy
her
friends
in
a
leisurely
unfatigued
fashion
which
was
a
standing
wonderment
to
cecy
whose
own
wedding
had
been
of
the
onerous
sort
and
had
worn
her
to
skin
and
bone
i
am
only
just
beginning
to
recover
from
it
now
she
remarked
plaintively
and
there
you
sit
katy
looking
as
fresh
as
a
rose
not
tired
a
bit
and
never
seeming
to
have
anything
on
your
mind
i
think
how
you
do
it
i
never
was
at
a
wedding
before
where
everybody
was
not
perfectly
worn
out
you
never
were
at
such
a
simple
wedding
before
explained
katy
i
not
ambitious
you
see
i
want
to
keep
things
pretty
much
as
they
are
every
day
only
with
a
little
more
of
everything
because
of
there
being
more
people
to
provide
for
if
i
were
attempting
to
make
it
a
beautiful
picturesque
wedding
we
should
get
as
tired
as
anybody
i
have
no
doubt
katy
gifts
were
numerous
enough
to
satisfy
even
clover
and
comprised
all
manner
of
things
from
a
silver
tray
which
came
with
a
rather
stiff
note
from
mrs
page
and
lilly
to
mary
new
debby
sifter
and
a
bottle
of
hair
tonic
from
an
old
woman
in
the
county
home
each
of
the
brothers
and
sisters
had
made
her
something
katy
having
expressed
a
preference
for
presents
of
home
manufacture
ashe
gave
her
a
beautiful
sapphire
ring
and
cecy
hall
as
they
still
called
her
inadvertently
half
the
time
an
elaborate
embroidered
by
herself
katy
liked
all
her
gifts
both
large
and
small
both
for
what
they
were
and
for
what
they
meant
and
took
a
good
healthy
hearty
satisfaction
in
the
fact
that
so
many
people
cared
for
her
and
had
worked
to
give
her
a
pleasure
cousin
helen
was
the
first
guest
to
arrive
five
days
before
the
wedding
when
carr
who
had
gone
to
buffalo
to
meet
and
escort
her
down
lifted
her
from
the
carriage
and
carried
her
indoors
all
of
them
could
easily
have
fancied
that
it
was
the
first
visit
happening
over
again
for
she
looked
exactly
as
she
did
then
and
scarcely
a
day
older
she
happened
to
have
on
a
soft
gray
travelling
dress
too
much
like
that
which
she
wore
on
the
previous
occasion
which
made
the
illusion
more
complete
but
there
was
no
illusion
to
cousin
helen
herself
everything
to
her
seemed
changed
and
quite
different
the
ten
years
which
had
passed
so
lightly
over
her
head
had
made
a
vast
alteration
in
the
cousins
whom
she
remembered
as
children
the
older
ones
were
grown
up
the
younger
ones
in
a
fair
way
to
be
so
even
phil
who
had
been
in
white
frocks
with
curls
falling
over
his
shoulders
at
the
time
of
her
former
visit
to
burnet
was
now
fifteen
and
as
tall
as
his
father
he
was
very
slight
in
build
and
looked
delicate
she
thought
but
katy
assured
her
that
he
was
perfectly
well
and
thin
only
because
he
had
outgrown
his
strength
it
was
one
of
the
delightful
results
of
katy
forehandedness
that
she
could
command
time
during
those
next
two
days
to
thoroughly
enjoy
cousin
helen
she
sat
beside
her
sofa
for
hours
at
a
time
holding
her
hand
and
talking
with
a
freedom
of
confidence
such
as
she
could
have
shown
to
no
one
else
except
perhaps
to
clover
she
had
the
feeling
that
in
so
doing
she
was
rendering
account
to
a
sort
of
visible
conscience
of
all
the
events
the
mistakes
the
successes
the
glad
and
the
sorry
of
the
long
interval
that
had
passed
since
they
met
it
was
a
pleasure
and
relief
to
her
and
to
cousin
helen
the
recital
was
of
equal
interest
for
though
she
knew
the
main
facts
by
letter
there
was
a
satisfaction
in
collecting
the
little
details
which
seldom
get
fully
put
into
letters
one
subject
only
katy
touched
rather
guardedly
and
that
was
ned
she
was
so
desirous
that
her
cousin
should
approve
of
him
and
so
anxious
not
to
raise
her
expectations
and
have
her
disappointed
that
she
would
not
half
say
how
very
nice
she
herself
thought
him
to
be
but
cousin
helen
could
read
between
the
lines
and
out
of
katy
very
reserve
she
constructed
an
idea
of
ned
which
satisfied
her
pretty
well
so
the
two
happy
days
passed
and
on
the
third
arrived
the
other
anxiously
expected
guests
rose
red
and
little
rose
they
came
early
in
the
morning
when
no
one
was
particularly
looking
for
them
which
made
it
all
the
pleasanter
clover
was
on
the
porch
twisting
the
honeysuckle
tendrils
upon
the
trellis
when
the
carriage
drove
up
to
the
gate
and
rose
sunny
face
popped
out
of
the
window
clover
recognized
her
at
once
and
with
a
shriek
which
brought
all
the
others
downstairs
flew
down
the
path
and
had
little
rose
in
her
arms
before
any
one
else
could
get
there
you
see
before
you
a
deserted
wife
was
rose
first

deniston

just
dumped

wharf
and

abominable

deniston

with
a
rapturous
squeeze

a
little
while

got
you
now
and
we
mean
to
keep
you
how
pleasant

said
rose
glancing
up
the
locust
walk
toward
the
house
which
wore
a
most
inviting
and
hospitable
air
with
doors
and
windows
wide
open
and
the
soft
wind
fluttering
the
vines
and
the
white
curtains
ah
there
comes
katy
now
she
ran
forward
to
meet
her
while
clover
followed
with
little
rose
let
me
det
down

said
that
young
lady
the
first
remark
she
had
made
i
tan

all
by
myself
i
am
not
a
baby
any
more
you
hear
her
talk
cried
katy
catching
her
up

wonderful
rosebud

aunt

dess
betause

waiting
for
you
and
mamma
to
come
and
help
me
well
we
is
here
in
a
tone
of
immense
satisfaction
now
you
tan
the
larger
rose
meanwhile
was
making
acquaintance
with
the
others
she
needed
no
introductions
but
seemed
to
know
by
instinct
which
was
each
boy
and
each
girl
and
to
fit
the
right
names
to
them
all
in
five
minutes
she
seemed
as
much
at
home
as
though
she
had
spent
her
life
in
burnet
they
bore
her
into
the
house
in
a
sort
of
triumph
and
upstairs
to
the
blue
bedroom
which
katy
and
clover
had
vacated
for
her
and
such
a
hubbub
of
talk
and
laughter
presently
issued
therefrom
that
cousin
helen
on
the
other
side
the
entry
asked
jane
to
set
her
door
open
that
she
might
enjoy
the
sounds
they
were
so
merry
rose
bright
rather
voice
was
easily
distinguishable
above
the
rest
she
was
evidently
relating
some
experience
of
her
journey
with
an
occasional
splash
by
way
of
accompaniment
which
suggested
that
she
might
be
washing
her
hands
yes
she
really
has
grown
awfully
pretty
and
she
had
on
the
loveliest
suit
you
ever
saw
with
a
hat
and
was
altogether
dazzling
and
do
you
know
i
was
really
quite
glad
to
see
her
i
imagine
why
but
i
was
i
did
stay
glad
long
however
why
not
what
did
she
do
this
in
clover
voice
well
she
did
do
anything
but
she
was
distant
and
disagreeable
i
scarcely
observed
it
at
first
i
was
so
pleased
to
see
one
of
the
old
hillsover
girls
and
i
went
on
being
very
cordial
then
lilly
tried
to
put
me
down
by
running
over
a
list
of
her
fine
acquaintances
lady
this
and
the
marquis
of
that
people
whom
she
and
her
mother
had
known
abroad
it
made
me
think
of
my
old
autograph
book
with
antonio
de
vallombrosa
and
the
rest
do
you
remember
of
course
we
do
well
go
on
at
last
she
said
something
about
comte
ernest
de
conflans
i
had
heard
of
him
perhaps
he
crossed
in
the
steamer
with
and
me
it
seems
and
we
have
seen
a
great
deal
of
him
this
appeared
a
good
opportunity
to
show
that
i
too
have
relations
with
the
nobility
so
i
said
yes
i
had
met
him
in
boston
and
my
sister
had
seen
a
good
deal
of
him
in
washington
last
winter
what
did
she
think
of
him
demanded
lilly
said
i
did
seem
to
think
a
great
deal
about
him
she
says
all
the
young
men
at
the
french
legation
seem
more
than
usually
foolish
but
comte
ernest
is
the
worst
of
the
lot
he
really
look
like
an
absolute
fool
you
know
i
added
pleasantly
now
girls
what
was
there
in
that
to
make
her
angry
can
you
tell
she
grew
scarlet
and
glared
as
if
she
wanted
to
bite
my
head
off
and
then
she
turned
her
back
and
would
scarcely
speak
to
me
again
does
she
always
behave
that
way
when
the
aristocracy
is
lightly
spoken
of
oh
rose
oh
rose
cried
clover
in
fits
of
laughter
did
you
really
tell
her
that
i
really
did
why
should
i
is
there
any
reason
in
particular
only
that
she
is
engaged
to
him
replied
katy
in
an
extinguished
voice
good
gracious
no
wonder
she
scowled
this
is
really
dreadful
but
then
why
did
she
look
so
black
when
she
asked
where
we
were
going
and
i
said
to
your
wedding
that
did
seem
to
please
her
any
more
than
my
little
remarks
about
the
nobility
i
do
pretend
to
understand
lilly
said
katy
temperately
she
is
an
odd
girl
i
suppose
an
odd
girl
ca
be
expected
to
have
an
even
temper
remarked
rose
apparently
speaking
with
a
hairpin
in
her
mouth
well
i
done
for
myself
that
is
evident
i
need
never
expect
any
notice
in
future
from
the
comtesse
de
conflans
cousin
helen
heard
no
more
but
presently
steps
sounded
outside
her
door
and
katy
looked
in
to
ask
if
she
were
dressed
and
if
she
might
bring
rose
in
a
request
which
was
gladly
granted
it
was
a
pretty
sight
to
see
rose
with
cousin
helen
she
knew
all
about
her
already
from
clover
and
katy
and
fell
at
once
under
the
gentle
spell
which
seemed
always
to
surround
that
invalid
sofa
begged
leave
to
say
cousin
helen
as
the
others
did
and
was
altogether
at
her
best
and
sweetest
when
with
her
full
of
merriment
but
full
too
of
a
deference
and
sympathy
which
made
her
particularly
charming
i
never
did
see
anything
so
lovely
in
all
my
life
before
she
told
clover
in
confidence
to
watch
her
lying
there
looking
so
radiant
and
so
peaceful
and
so
interested
in
katy
affairs
and
never
once
seeming
to
remember
that
except
for
that
accident
she
too
would
have
been
a
bride
and
had
a
wedding
it
perfectly
wonderful
do
you
suppose
she
is
never
sorry
for
herself
she
seems
the
merriest
of
us
all
i
do
think
she
remembers
herself
often
enough
to
be
sorry
she
is
always
thinking
of
some
one
else
it
seems
to
me
well
i
am
glad
to
have
seen
her
added
rose
in
a
more
serious
tone
than
was
usual
to
her
she
and
grandmamma
are
of
a
different
order
of
beings
from
the
rest
of
the
world
i
do
wonder
you
and
katy
always
were
so
good
you
ought
to
be
with
such
a
cousin
helen
i
do
think
we
were
as
good
as
you
make
us
out
but
cousin
helen
has
really
been
one
of
the
strong
influences
of
our
lives
she
was
the
making
of
katy
when
she
had
that
long
illness
and
katy
has
made
the
rest
of
us
little
rose
from
the
first
moment
became
the
delight
of
the
household
and
especially
of
amy
ashe
who
could
not
do
enough
for
her
and
took
her
off
her
mother
hands
so
entirely
that
rose
complained
that
she
seemed
to
have
lost
her
child
as
well
as
her
husband
she
was
a
sedate
little
maiden
and
wonderfully
wise
for
her
years
already
in
some
ways
she
seemed
older
than
her
erratic
little
mother
of
whom
in
a
droll
fashion
she
assumed
a
sort
of
charge
she
was
a
born
housewife
mamma
you
have
fordotten
your
wings
clover
would
hear
her
saying
mamma
you
has
a
wip
in
your
seeve
you
must
mend
it
or
mamma
fordet
dat
your
teys
is
in
the
top
dwawer
all
these
reminders
and
advices
being
made
particularly
comical
by
the
baby
pronunciation
theory
was
that
little
rose
was
a
messenger
from
heaven
sent
to
buffet
her
and
correct
her
mistakes
the
bane
and
the
antidote
she
would
say
think
of
my
having
a
child
with
powers
of
ratiocination
rose
came
down
the
night
of
her
arrival
after
a
long
freshening
nap
looking
rested
and
bonny
in
a
pretty
blue
dress
and
saying
that
as
little
rose
too
had
taken
a
good
sleep
she
might
sit
up
to
tea
if
the
family
liked
the
family
were
only
too
pleased
to
have
her
do
so
after
tea
rose
carried
her
off
ostensibly
to
go
to
bed
but
clover
heard
a
great
deal
of
confabulating
and
giggling
in
the
hall
and
on
the
stairs
and
soon
after
rose
returned
the
rang
loudly
and
there
entered
an
astonishing
vision
little
rose
costumed
as
a
cupid
or
a
no
one
knew
exactly
which
with
a
pair
of
large
white
wings
fastened
on
her
shoulders
and
dragging
behind
her
by
a
loop
of
ribbon
a

but
she
teached

to
me
so
i
tould
say
it
the
bundles
of
course
contained
wedding
gifts
rose
seemed
to
have
brought
her
trunk
full
of
them
there
were
a
pretty
pair
of
from
redding
a
charming
of
silver
with
an
antique
coin
set
in
the

long

little
pitcher
marked
with
love
from
mary
silver
then
a
parcel
tied
with
pink
ribbons
containing
a
of
japanese
leather
which
was
little
rose
gift
and
last
of
all
rose
own
present
a
delightful
case
full
of
ivory
brushes
and
combs
altogether
never
was
such
a
satisfactory
fardel
brought
by
hymen
or
any
other
express
company
before
and
in
opening
the
packages
reading
the
notes
that
came
with
them
and
exclaiming
and
admiring
time
flew
so
fast
that
rose
quite
forgot
the
hour
till
little
rose
growing
sleepy
reminded
her
of
it
by
saying
mamma
i
dess
i
better
do
to
bed
now
betause
if
i
do
i
shall
be
too
seepy
to
turn
to
aunt
taty
wedding
dear
me
cried
rose
catching
the
child
up
this
is
simply
dreadful
what
a
mother
i
am
things
come
to
a
pass
indeed
if
babes
and
sucklings
have
to
ask
to
be
put
to
bed
baby
you
ought
to
have
been
christened
nathan
the
wise
she
disappeared
with
roslein
drowsy
eyes
looking
over
her
shoulder
next
afternoon
came
ned
and
with
him
to
katy
surprise
and
pleasure
appeared
the
good
old
commodore
who
had
played
such
a
kind
part
in
their
affairs
in
italy
the
year
before
it
was
a
great
compliment
that
he
should
think
it
worth
while
to
come
so
far
to
see
one
of
his
junior
officers
married
and
it
showed
so
much
real
regard
for
ned
that
everybody
was
delighted
these
guests
were
quartered
with
ashe
but
they
took
most
of
their
meals
with
the
carrs
and
it
was
arranged
that
they
with
polly
and
amy
should
come
to
an
early
breakfast
on
the
marriage
morning
after
ned
arrival
things
did
seem
to
grow
a
little
fuller
and
busier
for
he
naturally
wanted
katy
to
himself
and
she
was
too
preoccupied
to
keep
her
calm
grasp
on
events
still
all
went
smoothly
and
rose
declared
that
there
never
was
such
a
wedding
since
the
world
was
made
no
tears
no
worries
nobody
looking
tired
nothing
disagreeable
clover
one
great
subject
of
concern
was
the
fear
that
it
might
rain
there
was
a
little
haze
about
the
sunset
the
night
before
and
she
expressed
her
intention
to
cousin
helen
of
lying
awake
all
night
to
see
how
things
looked
i
really
feel
as
if
i
could
not
bear
it
if
it
should
storm
she
said
after
all
this
fine
weather
too
and
i
know
i
shall
not
sleep
a
wink
anyway
i
think
we
can
trust
god
to
take
care
of
the
weather
even
on
replied
cousin
helen
gently
and
after
all
it
was
she
who
lay
awake
pain
had
made
her
a
restless
sleeper
and
as
her
bed
commanded
the
great
arch
of
western
sky
she
saw
the
moon
a
silver
shape
descend
and
disappear
a
little
before
midnight
she
roused
again
when
all
was
still
solemn
darkness
except
for
a
spangle
of
stars
and
later
opened
her
eyes
in
time
to
catch
the
faint
rose
flush
of
dawn
reflected
from
the
east
she
raised
herself
on
her
elbow
to
watch
the
light
grow
it
is
a
fair
day
for
the
child
she
whispered
to
herself
how
good
god
is
then
she
slept
again
for
a
long
restful
space
and
woke
refreshed
so
that
katy
secret
fear
that
cousin
helen
might
be
ill
from
excitement
and
not
able
to
come
to
her
wedding
was
not
realized
clover
meantime
had
slept
soundly
all
night
she
and
katy
shared
the
same
room
and
waked
almost
at
the
same
moment
it
was
early
still
but
the
sisters
felt
bright
and
rested
and
ready
for
work
so
they
rose
at
once
they
dressed
in
silence
after
a
little
whispered
rejoicing
over
the
beautiful
morning
and
in
silence
took
their
bibles
and
sat
down
side
by
side
to
read
the
daily
portion
which
was
their
habit
then
hand
in
hand
they
stole
downstairs
disturbing
nobody
softly
opened
doors
and
windows
carried
bowls
and
jars
out
on
the
porch
and
proceeded
to
arrange
a
great
basket
full
of
roses
which
had
been
brought
the
night
before
and
set
in
the
shade
of
the
willows
to
keep
fresh
before
breakfast
all
the
house
had
put
on
festal
airs
summer
had
come
early
to
burnet
that
year
every
garden
was
in
bud
and
blossom
and
every
one
who
had
flowers
had
sent
their
best
to
grace
katy
wedding
the
whole
world
seemed
full
of
delicious
smells
each
table
and
bore
a
fragrant
load
a
great
bowl
of
jacqueminots
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
and
two
large
jars
of
the
same
on
the
porch
where
clover
had
arranged
various
seats
and
cushions
that
it
might
serve
as
a
sort
of
outdoor
parlor
nobody
who
came
to
that
early
breakfast
ever
forgot
its
peace
and
pleasantness
and
the
sweet
atmosphere
of
affection
which
seemed
to
pervade
everything
about
it
after
breakfast
came
family
prayers
as
usual
carr
reading
the
chapter
and
the
dear
old
commodore
joining
with
a
hearty
nautical
voice
in
awake
my
soul
and
with
the
sun
which
was
a
favorite
hymn
with
all
of
them
ned
shared
katy
book
and
his
face
and
hers
alone
would
have
been
breakfast
enough
for
the
company
if
everything
else
had
failed
as
rose
remarked
to
clover
in
a
whisper
though
nobody
found
any
fault
with
the
more
substantial
fare
which
debby
had
sent
in
previously
somehow
this
little
mutual
service
of
prayer
and
praise
seemed
to
fit
in
with
the
spirit
of
the
day
and
give
it
its
keynote
it
just
the
sweetest
wedding
ashe
told
her
brother
and
the
wonderful
thing
is
that
everything
comes
so
naturally
katy
is
precisely
her
usual
self
only
a
little
more
so
i
under
great
obligations
to
amy
for
having
that
fever
was
somewhat
indirect
answer
but
his
sister
understood
what
he
meant
breakfast
over
the
guests
discreetly
removed
themselves
and
the
whole
family
joined
in
resetting
the
table
for
the
luncheon
which
was
to
be
at
two
katy
and
ned
departing
in
the
boat
at
four
it
was
a
simple
but
abundant
repast
with
plenty
of
delicious
food
oysters
and
salads
and
cold
chicken
fresh
salmon
from
lake
superior
a
big
virginia
ham
baked
to
perfection
red
and
translucent
to
its
savory
centre
hot
coffee
and
quantities
of
debby
perfect
rolls
there
were
strawberries
also
and
and
the
best
of
cake
and
jellies
and
everywhere
vases
of
fresh
roses
to
perfume
the
feast
when
all
was
arranged
there
was
still
time
for
katy
to
make
cousin
helen
a
visit
and
then
go
to
her
room
for
a
quiet
rest
before
dressing
and
still
that
same
unhurried
air
pervaded
the
house
there
had
been
a
little
discussion
the
night
before
as
to
just
how
the
bride
should
make
her
appearance
at
the
decisive
moment
but
katy
had
settled
it
by
saying
simply
that
she
should
come
downstairs
and
ned
could
meet
her
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
it
is
the
simplest
way
she
said
and
you
know
i
do
want
any
fuss
i
will
just
come
down
i
dare
say
she
right
remarked
rose
but
it
seems
to
me
to
require
a
great
deal
of
courage
and
after
all
it
did
the
simple
and
natural
way
of
doing
a
thing
generally
turns
out
the
easiest
clover
helped
katy
to
put
on
the
of
soft
crape
and
creamy
white
silk
it
was
trimmed
with
old
lace
and
knots
of
ribbon
and
katy
wore
with
it
two
or
three
white
roses
which
ned
had
brought
her
and
a
pearl
pendant
which
was
his
gift
then
clover
had
to
go
downstairs
to
receive
the
guests
and
see
that
cousin
helen
sofa
was
put
in
the
right
place
and
rose
who
remained
behind
had
the
pleasure
of
arranging
katy
veil
the
of
the
old
blonde
was
very
becoming
and
altogether
the
effect
though
not
stylish
was
very
sweet
katy
was
a
little
pale
but
otherwise
exactly
like
her
usual
self
with
no
tremors
or
presently
little
rose
came
up
with
a
message
aunty
tover
says
dat
dr
tone
has
tum
and
everything
is
weddy
and
better
tum
down
she
announced
katy
gave
rose
a
last
kiss
and
went
down
the
hall
but
little
rose
was
so
fascinated
by
the
appearance
of
the
white
dress
and
veil
that
she
kept
fast
hold
of
katy
hand
disregarding
her
mother
suggestion
that
she
should
slip
down
the
back
staircase
as
she
herself
proposed
to
do
no
i
want
to
do
with
my
aunt
taty
she
persisted
so
it
chanced
that
katy
came
downstairs
with
pretty
little
rose
clinging
to
her
like
a
sort
of
impromptu
bridesmaid
and
meeting
ned
eyes
as
he
stood
at
the
foot
waiting
for
her
she
forgot
herself
lost
the
little
sense
of
shyness
which
was
creeping
over
her
and
responded
to
his
look
with
a
tender
brilliant
smile
the
light
from
the
caught
her
face
and
figure
just
then
the
color
flashed
into
her
cheeks
and
she
looked
like
a
beautiful
happy
picture
of
a
bride
and
all
by
accident
which
was
the
best
thing
about
it
for
effects
are
not
always
effective
and
are
apt
to
betray
their
then
katy
took
ned
arm
little
rose
let
go
her
hand
and
they
went
into
the
parlor
and
were
married
stone
had
an
and
very
solemn
wedding
service
which
he
was
accustomed
to
use
on
such
occasions
he
generally
spoke
of
the
bride
as
thy
handmaiden
which
was
a
form
that
clover
particularly
deprecated
he
had
also
been
known
to
advert
to
the
world
where
there
is
neither
marrying
nor
giving
in
marriage
as
a
great
improvement
on
this
which
seemed
to
say
the
least
an
unfortunate
allusion
under
the
circumstances
but
upon
this
occasion
his
feelings
were
warmed
and
touched
and
he
called
katy
my
dear
child
which
was
much
better
than
thy
handmaiden
when
the
ceremony
was
over
ned
kissed
katy
and
her
father
kissed
her
and
the
girls
and
dorry
and
phil
and
then
without
waiting
for
any
one
else
she
left
her
place
and
went
straight
to
where
cousin
helen
lay
on
her
sofa
watching
the
scene
with
those
clear
tender
eyes
in
which
no
shadow
of
past
regrets
could
be
detected
katy
knelt
down
beside
her
and
they
exchanged
a
long
silent
embrace
there
was
no
need
for
words
between
hearts
which
knew
each
other
so
well
after
that
for
a
little
while
all
was
congratulations
and
good
wishes
i
think
no
bride
ever
carried
more
hearty
into
her
new
life
than
did
my
katy
all
sorts
of
people
took
ned
off
into
corners
to
tell
him
privately
what
a
fortunate
person
he
was
in
winning
such
a
wife
each
fresh
confidence
of
this
sort
was
a
fresh
delight
to
him
he
so
thoroughly
agreed
with
it
she
a
prize
sir
she
a
prize
old
worrett
kept
repeating
shaking
ned
hand
with
each
repetition
worrett
had
not
been
able
to
come
she
never
left
home
now
on
account
of
the
prevailing
weakness
of
carryalls
but
she
sent
katy
her
best
love
and
a
gorgeous
broom
made
of
the
tails
of
her
own
peacocks
are
you
sorry
you
are
not
going
to
stay
and
have
a
nice
time
with
us
all
and
help
eat
up
the
rest
of
the
cake
demanded
clover
as
she
put
her
head
into
the
carriage
for
a
last
kiss
two
hours
later
very
said
katy
but
she
did
look
sorry
at
all
there
one
comfort
clover
remarked
valiantly
as
she
walked
back
to
the
house
with
her
arm
round
rose
waist
she
coming
back
in
december
when
the
ship
sails
and
as
likely
as
not
she
will
stay
a
year
or
perhaps
two
that
what
i
like
about
the
navy
you
can
eat
your
cake
and
have
it
too
husbands
go
off
for
good
long
times
and
leave
their
wives
behind
them
i
think
it
delightful
i
wonder
if
katy
will
think
it
quite
so
delightful
remarked
rose
girls
are
not
always
so
anxious
to
ship
their
husbands
off
for
what
you
call
long
times
i
think
she
ought
it
seems
to
me
perfectly
unnatural
that
any
one
should
want
to
leave
her
own
family
and
go
away
for
always
i
like
ned
dearly
but
except
for
this
blessed
arrangement
about
going
to
sea
i
do
see
how
katy
could
clover
you
are
a
goose
you
be
wiser
one
of
these
days
see
if
you
are
was
rose
only
reply
chapter
iv
two
long
years
in
one
short
chapter
katy
absence
left
a
sad
blank
in
the
household
every
one
missed
her
but
nobody
so
much
as
clover
who
all
her
life
long
had
been
her
confidante
and
intimate
friend
it
was
a
great
help
that
rose
was
there
for
the
first
three
lonely
days
dulness
and
sadness
were
impossible
with
that
vivacious
little
person
at
hand
and
so
long
as
she
stayed
clover
had
small
leisure
to
be
mournful
rose
was
so
bright
and
merry
and
affectionate
that
elsie
and
john
were
almost
as
much
in
love
with
her
as
clover
herself
and
sat
and
sunned
themselves
in
her
warmth
so
to
speak
all
day
long
while
phil
and
dorry
fairly
quarrelled
as
to
which
should
have
the
pleasure
of
doing
little
services
for
her
and
baby
rose
if
she
could
have
remained
the
summer
through
all
would
have
seemed
easy
but
that
of
course
was
impossible
browne
appeared
with
a
provoking
punctuality
on
the
morning
of
the
fourth
day
prepared
to
carry
his
family
away
with
him
he
spent
one
night
at
carr
and
they
all
liked
him
very
much
no
one
could
help
it
he
was
so
cordial
and
friendly
and
pleasant
still
for
all
her
liking
clover
could
have
found
it
in
her
heart
to
quite
detest
him
as
the
final
moment
drew
near
let
him
go
home
without
you
she
urged
coaxingly
stay
with
us
all
summer
you
and
little
rose
he
can
come
back
in
september
to
fetch
you
and
it
would
be
so
delightful
to
us
my
dear
i
could
live
without
deniston
till
september
said
the
disappointing
rose
it
may
not
show
itself
to
a
casual
observer
but
i
am
really
quite
foolish
about
deniston
i
should
be
happy
away
from
him
at
all
he
the
only
husband
i
got
a
thing
but
mine
own
as
the
william
puts
it
oh
dear
groaned
clover
that
is
the
way
that
katy
is
going
to
talk
about
ned
i
suppose
matrimony
is
the
most
aggravating
condition
of
things
for
outsiders
that
was
ever
invented
i
wish
nobody
invented
it
here
it
would
be
so
nice
for
us
to
have
you
stay
and
the
moment
that
provoking
husband
of
yours
appears
you
ca
think
of
any
one
else
too
true
much
too
true
now
clovy
do
embitter
our
last
moments
with
reproaches
it
hard
enough
to
leave
you
as
it
is
when
i
just
found
you
again
after
all
these
years
i
had
the
most
beautiful
visit
that
ever
was
and
you
all
been
awfully
dear
and
nice
me
quick
and
let
me
go
as
the
song
says
i
only
wish
burnet
was
next
door
to
west
cedar
street
next
day
browne
sailed
away
with
his
handful
of
roses
as
elsie
sentimentally
termed
them
and
indeed
rose
by
herself
would
have
been
a
handful
for
almost
any
man
and
clover
like
lord
ullin
was
left
lamenting
cousin
helen
remained
however
and
it
was
not
till
she
too
departed
a
week
later
that
clover
fully
recognized
what
it
meant
to
have
katy
married
then
indeed
she
could
have
found
it
in
her
heart
to
emulate
eugénie
de
la
ferronayes
and
shed
tears
over
all
the
little
inanimate
objects
which
her
sister
had
left
behind
the
gloves
the
old
dressing
slippers
in
the
but
dear
me
we
get
used
to
everything
and
it
is
fortunate
that
we
do
life
is
too
full
and
hearts
too
flexible
and
really
sad
things
too
sad
for
the
survival
of
sentimental
regrets
over
changes
which
do
not
involve
real
loss
and
the
wide
separation
of
death
in
time
clover
learned
to
live
without
katy
and
to
be
cheerful
still
her
cheerfulness
was
greatly
helped
by
the
letters
which
came
regularly
and
showed
how
contented
katy
herself
was
she
and
ned
were
having
a
beautiful
time
first
in
new
york
and
making
visits
near
it
then
in
portsmouth
and
portland
when
the
frigate
moved
on
to
these
harbors
and
in
newport
which
was
full
and
gay
and
amusing
to
the
last
degree
later
in
august
the
letters
came
from
bar
harbor
where
katy
had
followed
in
company
with
the
commodore
wife
who
seemed
as
nice
as
her
husband
and
clover
heard
of
all
manner
of
delightful
doings
sails
excursions
receptions
on
board
ship
and
long
moonlight
paddles
with
ned
who
was
an
expert
canoeist
everybody
was
so
wonderfully
kind
katy
said
but
ned
wrote
to
his
sister
that
katy
was
a
great
favorite
every
one
liked
her
and
his
particular
friends
were
all
raging
wildly
round
in
quest
of
girls
just
like
her
to
marry
but
it
no
use
for
as
i
tell
them
he
added
that
sort
is
made
in
batches
there
is
only
one
katy
and
happily
she
belongs
to
me
and
the
other
fellows
must
get
along
as
they
can
this
was
all
satisfactory
and
comforting
and
clover
could
endure
a
little
loneliness
herself
so
long
as
her
beloved
katy
seemed
so
happy
she
was
very
busy
besides
and
there
compensations
as
she
admitted
to
herself
she
liked
the
consequence
of
being
at
the
head
of
domestic
affairs
and
succeeding
to
katy
position
as
papa
special
daughter
the
person
to
whom
he
came
for
all
he
wanted
and
to
whom
he
told
his
little
secrets
she
and
elsie
became
more
intimate
than
they
had
ever
been
before
and
elsie
in
her
turn
enjoyed
being
clover
lieutenant
as
clover
had
been
katy
so
the
summer
did
not
seem
long
to
any
of
them
and
when
september
was
once
past
and
they
could
begin
to
say
month
after
next
the
time
sped
much
faster
hall
asked
me
this
morning
when
the
worthingtons
were
coming
said
johnnie
one
day
it
seems
so
funny
to
have
katy
spoken
of
as
worthingtons
i
only
wish
the
worthingtons
would
write
and
say
when
remarked
clover
it
is
more
than
a
week
since
we
heard
from
them
the
next
day
brought
the
letter
and
the
good
news
that
ned
had
a
fortnight
leave
and
meant
to
bring
katy
home
the
middle
of
november
and
stay
for
thanksgiving
after
that
the
natchitoches
was
to
sail
for
an
eighteen
months
cruise
to
china
and
japan
and
then
ned
would
probably
have
two
years
ashore
at
the
torpedo
station
or
naval
academy
or
somewhere
and
they
would
start
a
little
home
for
themselves
meantime
wrote
katy
i
am
coming
to
spend
a
year
and
a
half
with
you
if
urged
do
all
speak
at
once
and
do
mind
saying
so
if
you
want
me
the
bitter
drop
in
this
pleasant
intelligence
there
generally
is
one
you
know
was
that
the
fortnight
of
ned
stay
was
to
be
spent
at
ashe
it
her
only
chance
to
see
ned
said
katy
so
i
know
you
wo
mind
for
afterward
you
will
have
me
for
such
a
long
visit
but
they
mind
very
much
i
do
think
it
fair
cried
johnnie
hotly
while
clover
and
elsie
exchanged
disgusted
looks
katy
belongs
to
us
katy
belongs
to
her
husband
on
the
contrary
said
carr
overhearing
her
you
must
learn
that
lesson
once
for
all
children
there
no
escape
from
the
melancholy
fact
and
it
quite
right
and
natural
that
ned
should
wish
to
go
to
his
sister
and
she
should
want
to
have
him
ned
yes
but
katy
my
dear
katy
ned
answered
carr
with
a
twinkle
then
noticing
the
extremely
unconvinced
expression
of
johnnie
face
he
added
more
seriously
do
be
cross
children
and
spoil
all
katy
pleasure
in
coming
home
with
your
foolish
jealousies
clover
i
trust
to
you
to
take
these
young
mutineers
in
hand
and
make
them
listen
to
reason
thus
appealed
to
clover
rallied
her
powers
and
while
laboring
to
bring
elsie
and
john
to
a
proper
frame
of
mind
schooled
herself
as
well
so
as
to
be
able
to
treat
ashe
amiably
when
they
met
dear
unconscious
polly
meanwhile
was
devising
all
sorts
of
pleasant
and
hospitable
plans
designed
to
make
ned
stay
a
sort
of
continuous
fête
to
everybody
she
put
on
no
airs
over
the
preference
shown
her
and
was
altogether
so
kind
and
friendly
and
sweet
that
no
one
could
quarrel
with
her
even
in
thought
and
johnnie
herself
had
to
forgive
her
and
be
contented
with
a
little
whispered
grumble
to
dorry
now
and
then
over
the
inconvenience
of
possessing
and
then
katy
came
the
same
katy
only
as
clover
thought
nicer
brighter
dearer
and
certainly
than
ever
sea
air
had
tanned
her
a
little
but
the
brown
was
becoming
and
she
had
gained
an
ease
and
polish
of
manner
which
her
sisters
admired
very
much
and
after
all
it
seemed
to
make
little
difference
at
which
house
they
stayed
for
they
were
in
and
out
of
both
all
day
long
and
ashe
threw
her
doors
open
to
the
carrs
and
wanted
some
or
all
of
them
for
every
meal
so
that
except
for
the
name
of
the
thing
it
was
almost
as
satisfactory
to
have
katy
over
the
way
as
occupying
her
old
quarters
the
fortnight
sped
only
too
rapidly
ned
departed
and
katy
settled
herself
in
the
familiar
corner
to
wait
till
he
should
come
back
again
navy
wives
have
to
learn
the
hard
lesson
of
patience
in
the
long
separations
entailed
by
their
husbands
profession
katy
missed
ned
sorely
but
she
was
too
unselfish
to
mope
or
to
let
the
others
know
how
hard
to
bear
his
loss
seemed
to
her
she
never
told
any
one
how
she
lay
awake
in
stormy
nights
or
when
the
wind
blew
and
it
seemed
to
blow
oftener
than
usual
that
winter
imagining
the
frigate
in
a
gale
and
whispering
little
prayers
for
ned
safety
then
her
good
sense
would
come
back
and
remind
her
that
wind
in
burnet
did
not
necessarily
mean
wind
in
shanghai
or
yokohama
or
wherever
the
natchitoches
might
be
and
she
would
put
herself
to
sleep
with
the
repetition
of
that
lovely
verse
of
keble
evening
hymn
left
out
in
most
of
the
collections
but
which
was
particularly
dear
to
her
thou
ruler
of
the
light
and
dark
guide
through
the
tempest
thine
own
ark
amid
the
howling
wintry
sea
we
are
in
port
if
we
have
thee
so
the
winter
passed
and
the
spring
and
another
summer
came
and
went
with
little
change
to
the
quiet
burnet
household
and
katy
brief
life
with
her
husband
began
to
seem
dreamy
and
unreal
it
lay
so
far
behind
and
then
with
the
beginning
of
the
second
winter
came
a
new
anxiety
phil
as
we
said
in
the
last
chapter
had
grown
too
fast
to
be
very
strong
and
was
the
most
delicate
of
the
family
in
looks
and
health
though
full
of
spirit
and
fun
going
out
to
skate
with
some
other
boys
the
week
before
christmas
on
a
pond
which
was
not
so
securely
frozen
as
it
looked
the
ice
gave
way
and
though
no
one
was
drowned
the
whole
party
had
a
drenching
and
were
thoroughly
chilled
none
of
the
others
minded
it
much
but
the
exposure
had
a
serious
effect
on
phil
he
caught
a
bad
cold
which
rapidly
increased
into
pneumonia
and
christmas
day
usually
such
a
bright
one
in
the
carr
household
was
overshadowed
by
anxious
forebodings
for
phil
was
seriously
ill
and
the
doctor
felt
by
no
means
sure
how
things
would
turn
with
him
the
sisters
nursed
him
devotedly
and
by
march
he
was
out
again
but
he
did
not
get
or
lose
the
persistent
little
cough
which
kept
him
thin
and
weak
carr
tried
this
remedy
and
that
but
nothing
seemed
to
do
much
good
and
katy
thought
that
her
father
looked
graver
and
more
anxious
every
time
that
he
tested
temperature
or
listened
at
his
chest
it
not
serious
yet
he
told
her
in
private
but
i
do
like
the
look
of
things
the
boy
is
just
at
a
any
little
thing
might
set
him
one
way
or
the
other
i
wish
i
could
send
him
away
from
this
damp
lake
climate
but
sending
a
boy
away
is
not
such
an
easy
thing
nor
was
it
quite
clear
where
he
ought
to
go
so
matters
drifted
along
for
another
month
and
then
phil
settled
the
question
for
himself
by
having
a
slight
hemorrhage
it
was
evident
that
something
must
be
done
and
speedily
but
what
carr
wrote
to
various
medical
acquaintances
and
in
reply
pamphlets
and
letters
poured
in
each
designed
to
prove
that
the
particular
part
of
the
country
to
which
the
pamphlet
or
the
letter
referred
was
the
only
one
to
which
it
was
at
all
worth
while
to
consign
an
invalid
with
delicate
lungs
one
recommended
florida
another
georgia
a
third
south
carolina
a
fourth
and
fifth
recommended
cold
instead
of
heat
and
an
open
air
life
with
the
mercury
at
zero
it
was
hard
to
decide
what
was
best
he
ought
not
to
go
off
alone
either
said
the
puzzled
father
he
is
neither
old
enough
nor
wise
enough
to
manage
by
himself
but
who
to
send
with
him
is
the
puzzle
it
doubles
the
expense
too
perhaps
i
began
katy
but
her
father
cut
her
short
with
a
gesture
no
katy
i
could
permit
that
your
husband
is
due
in
a
few
weeks
now
you
must
be
free
to
go
to
him
wherever
he
is
not
hampered
with
the
care
of
a
sick
brother
besides
whoever
takes
charge
of
phil
must
be
prepared
for
a
long
absence
at
least
a
year
it
must
be
either
clover
or
myself
and
as
it
seems
out
of
the
question
that
i
shall
drop
my
practice
for
a
year
clover
is
the
person
phil
is
seventeen
now
suggested
katy
that
is
not
so
very
young
no
not
if
he
were
in
full
health
plenty
of
boys
no
older
than
he
have
gone
out
west
by
themselves
and
fared
perfectly
well
but
in
condition
that
would
never
answer
he
has
a
tendency
to
be
about
himself
too
and
he
needs
incessant
care
and
watchfulness
out
west
repeated
katy
have
you
decided
then
yes
the
letter
i
had
yesterday
from
hope
makes
me
pretty
sure
that
helen
is
the
best
place
we
have
heard
of
helen
where
is
that
it
is
one
of
the
new
in
colorado
which
has
lately
come
into
notice
for
consumptives
it
very
high
up
nearly
or
quite
six
thousand
feet
and
the
air
is
said
to
be
something
remarkable
clover
will
manage
beautifully
i
think
she
is
such
a
sensible
little
thing
said
katy
she
seems
to
me
and
he
too
about
as
fit
to
go
off
two
thousand
miles
by
themselves
as
the
babes
in
the
wood
remarked
carr
who
like
many
other
fathers
found
it
hard
to
realize
that
his
children
had
outgrown
their
childhood
however
there
no
help
for
it
if
i
do
stay
and
grind
away
at
the
mill
there
is
no
one
to
pay
for
this
long
journey
clover
will
have
to
do
her
best
and
a
very
good
best
it
will
be
you
see
said
katy
consolingly
does
hope
tell
you
anything
about
the
place
she
added
turning
over
the
letter
which
her
father
had
handed
her
oh
he
says
the
scenery
is
fine
and
the
mean
is
this
and
the
mean
precipitation
that
and
that
can
be
had
that
is
pretty
much
all
so
far
as
climate
goes
it
is
the
right
place
but
i
presume
the
accommodations
are
poor
enough
the
children
must
go
prepared
to
rough
it
the
town
was
only
settled
ten
or
eleven
years
ago
there
has
been
time
to
make
things
comfortable
remarked
carr
with
a
truly
eastern
ignorance
of
the
rapid
way
in
which
things
march
in
the
far
west
clover
feelings
when
the
decision
was
announced
to
her
it
would
be
hard
to
explain
in
full
she
was
both
confused
and
exhilarated
by
the
sudden
weight
of
responsibility
laid
upon
her
to
leave
everybody
and
everything
she
had
always
been
used
to
and
go
away
to
such
a
distance
alone
with
phil
made
her
gasp
with
a
sense
of
dismay
while
at
the
same
time
the
idea
that
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
was
trusted
with
something
really
important
roused
her
energies
and
made
her
feel
braced
and
valiant
like
a
soldier
to
whom
some
difficult
enterprise
is
intrusted
on
the
day
of
battle
many
consultations
followed
as
to
what
the
travellers
should
carry
with
them
by
what
route
they
would
best
go
and
how
prepare
for
the
journey
a
great
deal
of
contradictory
advice
was
offered
as
is
usually
the
case
when
people
are
starting
on
a
voyage
or
a
long
railway
ride
one
friend
wrote
to
recommend
that
they
should
provide
themselves
with
a
provisions
in
advance
and
enclosed
a
list
of
crackers
jam
potted
meats
tea
fruit
and
hardware
which
would
have
made
a
heavy
load
for
a
donkey
or
mule
to
carry
how
were
poor
clover
and
phil
to
transport
such
a
weight
of
things
another
advised
against
umbrellas
and
cloaks
what
was
the
use
of
such
things
where
it
never
rained
while
a
second
letter
received
the
same
day
assured
them
that
thunder
and
hail
storms
were
things
for
which
travellers
in
colorado
must
live
in
a
state
of
continual
preparation
who
shall
decide
when
doctors
disagree
in
the
end
clover
concluded
that
it
was
best
to
follow
the
leadings
of
commonsense
and
rational
precaution
do
about
a
quarter
of
what
people
advised
and
leave
the
rest
undone
and
she
found
that
this
worked
very
well
as
they
knew
so
little
of
the
resources
of
helen
and
there
was
such
a
strong
impression
prevailing
in
the
family
as
to
its
being
a
rough
sort
of
place
clover
and
katy
judged
it
wise
to
pack
a
large
box
of
stores
to
go
out
by
freight
oatmeal
and
arrowroot
and
and
albert
biscuits
things
which
philly
ought
to
have
and
which
in
a
wild
region
might
be
hard
to
come
by
debby
filled
all
the
corners
with
dainties
of
various
sorts
and
clover
besides
a
and
a
put
into
her
trunks
various
small
decorations
japanese
fans
and
pictures
photographs
a
vase
or
two
books
and
a
things
which
took
little
room
and
which
she
thought
would
make
their
quarters
look
more
comfortable
in
case
they
were
very
bare
and
unfurnished
people
felt
sorry
for
the
probable
hardships
the
brother
and
sister
were
to
undergo
and
they
had
as
many
little
gifts
and
notes
of
sympathy
and
counsel
as
katy
herself
when
she
was
starting
for
europe
but
i
am
anticipating
before
the
trunks
were
packed
carr
anxieties
about
his
babes
in
the
wood
were
greatly
allayed
by
a
visit
from
hall
she
came
to
tell
him
that
she
had
heard
of
a
possible
matron
for
clover
i
am
not
acquainted
with
the
lady
myself
she
said
but
my
cousin
who
writes
about
her
knows
her
quite
well
and
says
she
is
a
highly
respectable
person
and
belongs
to
nice
people
her
sister
or
some
one
married
a
phillips
of
boston
and
i
always
heard
that
that
family
was
one
of
the
best
there
she
had
some
malarial
trouble
and
is
at
the
west
now
on
account
of
it
staying
with
a
friend
in
omaha
but
she
wants
to
spend
the
summer
at
helen
and
as
i
know
you
have
worried
a
good
deal
over
having
clover
and
phil
go
off
by
themselves
i
thought
it
might
be
a
comfort
to
you
to
hear
of
this
mrs
watson
you
are
very
good
if
she
proves
to
be
the
right
sort
of
person
it
be
an
immense
comfort
do
you
know
when
she
wants
to
start
about
the
end
of
may
just
the
right
time
you
see
she
could
join
clover
and
philip
as
they
go
through
which
will
work
nicely
for
them
all
so
it
will
well
this
is
quite
a
relief
please
write
to
your
cousin
hall
and
make
the
arrangement
i
do
want
watson
to
be
burdened
with
any
real
care
of
the
children
of
course
but
if
she
can
arrange
to
go
along
with
them
and
give
clover
a
word
of
advice
now
and
then
should
she
need
it
i
shall
be
easier
in
my
mind
about
them
clover
was
only
doubtfully
grateful
when
she
heard
of
this
arrangement
papa
always
will
persist
in
thinking
that
i
am
a
baby
still
she
said
to
katy
drawing
her
little
figure
up
to
look
as
tall
as
possible
i
am
i
would
have
him
remember
how
do
we
know
what
this
watson
is
like
she
may
be
the
most
disagreeable
person
in
the
world
for
all
papa
can
tell
i
really
ca
find
it
in
my
heart
to
be
sorry
that
it
has
happened
papa
looks
so
much
relieved
by
it
katy
rejoined
but
all
dissatisfactions
and
worries
and
misgivings
took
wings
and
flew
away
when
just
ten
days
before
the
travellers
were
to
start
a
new
and
delightful
change
was
made
in
the
programme
ned
telegraphed
that
the
ship
instead
of
coming
to
new
york
was
ordered
to
san
francisco
to
refit
and
he
wanted
katy
to
join
him
there
early
in
june
prepared
to
spend
the
summer
while
almost
simultaneously
came
a
letter
from
ashe
who
with
amy
had
been
staying
a
couple
of
months
in
new
york
to
say
that
hearing
of
ned
plan
had
decided
her
also
to
take
a
trip
to
california
with
some
friends
who
had
previously
asked
her
to
join
them
these
friends
were
it
seemed
the
daytons
of
albany
dayton
was
a
railroad
magnate
and
had
the
control
of
a
private
car
in
which
the
party
were
to
travel
and
ashe
was
authorized
to
invite
katy
and
clover
and
phil
also
to
go
along
with
them
the
former
all
the
way
to
california
and
the
others
as
far
as
denver
where
the
roads
separated
this
was
truly
delightful
such
an
offer
was
surely
worth
a
few
delay
the
plan
seemed
to
settle
itself
all
in
one
minute
watson
whom
every
one
now
regretted
as
a
complication
was
the
only
difficulty
but
a
couple
of
telegrams
settled
that
perplexity
and
it
was
arranged
that
she
should
join
them
on
the
same
train
though
in
a
different
car
to
have
katy
as
a
and
ashe
and
amy
made
a
different
thing
of
the
long
journey
and
clover
proceeded
with
her
preparations
in
jubilant
spirits
chapter
car
it
is
they
who
stay
behind
who
suffer
most
from
those
who
go
have
the
continual
change
of
scenes
and
impressions
to
help
them
to
forget
those
who
remain
must
bear
as
best
they
may
the
dull
heavy
sense
of
loss
and
separation
the
parting
at
burnet
was
not
a
cheerful
one
clover
was
oppressed
with
the
nearness
of
untried
responsibilities
and
though
she
kept
up
a
brave
face
she
was
inwardly
homesick
phil
slept
badly
the
night
before
the
start
and
looked
so
wan
and
thin
as
he
stood
on
the
steamer
deck
beside
his
sisters
waving
to
the
party
on
the
wharf
that
a
new
and
sharp
thrill
of
anxiety
shot
through
his
father
heart
the
boy
looked
so
young
and
helpless
to
be
sent
away
ill
among
strangers
and
little
clover
seemed
such
a
fragile
support
there
was
no
help
for
it
the
thing
was
decided
on
decided
for
the
best
as
they
all
hoped
but
carr
was
not
at
all
happy
in
his
mind
as
he
watched
the
steamer
become
a
gradually
lessening
speck
in
the
distance
and
he
sighed
heavily
when
at
last
he
turned
away
elsie
echoed
the
sigh
she
too
had
noticed
phil
looks
and
gravity
and
her
heart
felt
heavy
within
her
the
house
when
they
reached
it
seemed
lonely
and
empty
papa
went
at
once
to
his
office
and
they
heard
him
lock
the
door
this
was
such
an
unusual
proceeding
in
the
middle
of
the
morning
that
she
and
johnnie
opened
wide
eyes
of
dismay
at
each
other
is
papa
crying
do
you
suppose
whispered
john
no
i
do
think
it
can
be
papa
never
does
cry
but
i
afraid
he
feeling
badly
responded
elsie
in
the
same
hushed
tone
oh
dear
how
horrid
it
is
not
even
to
have
clover
at
home
what
we
going
to
do
without
her
and
katy
i
do
know
i
sure
you
ca
think
how
queer
i
feel
elsie
just
as
if
my
heart
had
slipped
out
of
its
place
and
was
going
down
down
into
my
boots
i
think
it
must
be
the
way
people
feel
when
they
are
homesick
i
had
it
once
before
when
i
was
at
inches
mills
but
never
since
then
how
i
wish
philly
had
never
gone
to
skate
on
that
nasty
pond
and
john
burst
into
a
passion
of
tears
oh
do
do
cried
poor
elsie
for
johnnie
sobs
were
infectious
and
she
felt
an
ominous
lump
coming
into
her
own
throat
do
behave
so
johnnie
think
if
papa
came
out
and
found
us
crying
clover
particularly
said
that
we
must
make
the
house
bright
for
him
i
going
to
sow
the
mignonette
seed
desperately
come
and
help
me
the
trowel
is
on
the
back
porch
and
you
might
get
dorry
and
cut
some
little
sticks
to
mark
the
places
this
expedient
was
successful
johnnie
who
loved
to
whittle
above
all
things
dried
her
tears
and
ran
for
her
shade
hat
and
by
the
time
the
tiny
brown
seeds
were
sprinkled
into
the
brown
earth
of
the
borders
both
the
girls
were
themselves
again
carr
appeared
from
his
retirement
half
an
hour
later
a
note
had
come
for
him
meanwhile
but
somehow
no
one
had
quite
liked
to
knock
at
the
door
and
deliver
it
elsie
handed
it
to
him
now
with
a
timid
anxious
look
whose
import
seemed
to
strike
him
for
he
laughed
a
little
and
pinched
her
cheek
as
he
read
i
been
writing
to
hope
about
the
children
he
said
that
all
do
wait
dinner
for
me
chicks
i
off
for
the
corners
to
see
a
boy
who
had
a
fall
and
i
get
a
bite
there
order
something
good
for
tea
elsie
and
afterward
we
have
a
game
of
cribbage
if
i
not
called
out
we
must
be
as
jolly
as
we
can
or
clover
will
scold
us
when
she
comes
back
meanwhile
the
three
travellers
were
faring
through
the
first
stage
of
their
journey
very
comfortably
the
fresh
air
and
change
brightened
phil
he
ate
a
good
dinner
and
afterward
took
quite
a
long
nap
on
a
sofa
clover
sitting
by
to
keep
him
covered
and
see
that
he
did
not
get
cold
late
in
the
evening
they
changed
to
the
express
train
and
there
again
phil
after
being
tucked
up
behind
the
curtains
of
his
section
went
to
sleep
and
passed
a
satisfactory
night
so
that
he
reached
chicago
looking
so
much
better
than
when
they
left
burnet
that
his
father
heart
would
have
been
lightened
could
he
have
seen
him
ashe
came
down
to
the
station
to
meet
them
together
with
dayton
a
kind
friendly
man
with
a
tired
but
particularly
pleasant
face
all
the
necessary
transfer
of
baggage
was
made
easy
and
they
were
carried
off
at
once
to
the
hotel
where
rooms
had
been
secured
there
they
were
rapturously
received
by
amy
and
introduced
to
dayton
a
sweet
spirited
little
matron
with
a
face
as
kindly
as
her
husband
but
not
so
worn
dayton
looked
as
if
for
years
he
had
been
bearing
the
whole
weight
of
a
railroad
on
his
shoulders
as
in
one
sense
it
may
be
said
that
he
had
we
have
been
here
almost
a
whole
day
said
amy
who
had
taken
possession
as
a
matter
of
course
of
her
old
perch
on
katy
knee
chicago
is
the
biggest
place
you
ever
saw
tanta
but
it
is
so
pretty
as
burnet
and
oh
do
you
think
car
is
nice
the
one
we
are
going
out
west
in
you
know
and
this
morning
dayton
took
us
to
see
it
it
the
cunningest
place
that
ever
was
there
one
dear
little
drawer
in
the
wall
that
dayton
says
i
may
have
to
keep
mabel
things
in
i
never
saw
a
drawer
in
a
car
before
there
a
lovely
little
bedroom
too
and
such
a
nice
and
a
kitchen
and
all
sorts
of
things
i
can
hardly
wait
till
i
show
them
to
you
do
you
think
that
travelling
is
the
most
delightful
thing
in
the
world
miss
clover
yes
if
only
people
do
get
too
tired
said
clover
with
an
anxious
glance
at
phil
as
he
lay
back
in
an
she
did
not
dare
say
if
phil
does
get
too
tired
for
she
had
already
discovered
that
nothing
annoyed
him
so
much
as
being
talked
about
as
an
invalid
and
that
he
was
very
apt
to
revenge
himself
by
doing
something
imprudent
immediately
afterward
to
disguise
from
an
observant
world
the
fact
that
he
could
do
it
without
running
a
risk
like
most
boys
he
resented
being
fussed
over
a
fact
which
made
the
care
of
him
more
difficult
than
it
would
otherwise
have
been
the
room
which
had
been
taken
for
clover
and
katy
looked
out
on
the
lake
which
was
not
far
away
and
the
reach
of
blue
water
would
have
made
a
pretty
view
if
trains
of
cars
had
not
continually
steamed
between
it
and
the
hotel
staining
the
sky
and
blurring
the
prospect
with
their
smokes
katy
wondered
how
it
happened
that
the
early
settlers
who
laid
out
chicago
had
not
bethought
themselves
to
secure
this
fine
water
frontage
as
an
ornament
to
the
future
city
but
dayton
explained
that
in
the
rapid
growth
of
western
towns
things
arranged
themselves
rather
than
were
arranged
for
and
that
the
first
pioneers
had
other
things
to
think
about
than
what
a
new
englander
would
call
sightliness
and
katy
could
easily
believe
this
to
be
true
car
was
on
the
track
when
they
drove
to
the
station
at
noon
next
day
it
was
the
end
car
of
a
long
express
train
which
dayton
told
them
is
considered
the
place
of
honor
and
generally
assigned
to
private
cars
it
was
of
an
pattern
and
did
not
compare
as
they
were
informed
with
the
palaces
on
wheels
built
nowadays
for
the
use
of
railroad
presidents
and
directors
but
though
katy
heard
of
cars
with
french
beds
plunge
baths
open
fireplaces
and
other
incredible
luxuries
car
still
seemed
to
her
inexperienced
eyes
and
clover
a
marvel
of
comfort
and
convenience
a
small
kitchen
a
store
closet
and
a
sort
of
fitted
with
berths
for
two
servants
occupied
the
end
of
the
car
nearest
the
engine
then
came
a
with
ample
marble
basins
where
hot
water
as
well
as
cold
was
always
on
tap
then
a
wide
with
a
bed
on
either
side
and
then
a
large
compartment
occupying
the
middle
of
the
car
where
by
day
four
nice
little
could
be
set
with
a
seat
on
either
side
and
by
night
six
sleeping
sections
made
up
the
rest
of
the
car
was
arranged
as
a
glassed
all
around
and
furnished
with
comfortable
seats
of
various
kinds
a
two
or
three
tables
of
different
sizes
and
various
small
lockers
and
receptacles
fitted
into
the
partitions
to
serve
as
for
loose
articles
of
all
sorts
bunches
of
lovely
roses
and
baskets
of
strawberries
stood
on
the
tables
and
quite
a
number
of
the
daytons
friends
had
come
down
to
see
them
off
each
bringing
some
sort
of
gift
for
the
travellers
flowers
hothouse
grapes
early
cherries
or
cake
they
were
all
so
cordial
and
pleasant
and
so
interested
in
phil
that
katy
and
clover
lost
their
hearts
to
each
in
turn
and
forever
afterward
were
ready
to
stand
up
for
chicago
as
the
kindest
place
that
ever
was
seen
then
amid
farewells
and
good
wishes
the
train
moved
slowly
out
of
the
station
and
the
inmates
of
car
proceeded
to
go
to
housekeeping
as
dayton
expressed
it
and
to
settle
themselves
and
their
belongings
in
these
new
quarters
ashe
and
amy
it
was
decided
should
occupy
the
and
the
other
ladies
were
to
dress
there
when
it
was
convenient
sections
were
assigned
to
everybody
opposite
phil
so
that
she
might
hear
him
if
he
needed
anything
in
the
night
and
dayton
called
for
all
the
bonnets
and
hats
and
amid
much
laughter
proceeded
to
pin
up
each
in
thick
folds
of
newspaper
and
fasten
it
on
a
hook
not
to
be
taken
down
till
the
end
of
the
journey
feathered
turban
took
its
turn
with
the
rest
at
amy
particular
request
dust
was
the
main
thing
to
be
guarded
against
and
katy
having
been
duly
forewarned
had
gone
out
in
the
morning
and
bought
for
herself
and
clover
soft
hats
of
felt
and
veils
of
the
same
color
like
those
which
dayton
and
polly
had
provided
for
the
journey
and
which
had
the
advantage
of
being
light
as
well
as
unspoilable
but
there
was
no
dust
that
first
morning
as
the
train
ran
smoothly
across
the
fertile
prairies
of
illinois
first
and
then
of
iowa
between
fields
dazzling
with
the
fresh
green
of
wheat
and
rye
and
waysides
studded
with
such
as
none
of
them
had
ever
seen
or
dreamed
of
before
pink
spikes
and
white
and
vivid
blue
spikes
masses
of
brown
and
orange
cups
like
tulips
ranks
of
beautiful
vetches
and
purple
lupines
escholtzias
like
immense
sweeps
of
golden
sunlight
wild
sweet
peas
blossoms
whose
name
no
one
knew
all
flung
broadcast
over
the
face
of
the
land
and
in
such
stintless
quantities
that
it
dazzled
the
mind
to
think
of
as
it
did
the
eyes
to
behold
them
the
horizons
looked
infinitely
far
off
the
sense
of
space
was
confusing
here
and
there
appeared
a
backed
with
a
of
trees
but
the
general
impression
was
of
vast
still
distance
endless
reaches
of
sky
and
uncounted
flowers
growing
for
their
own
pleasure
and
with
no
regard
for
human
observation
in
studying
car
katy
was
much
impressed
by
the
thoroughness
of
dayton
preparations
for
the
comfort
of
her
party
everything
that
could
possibly
be
needed
seemed
to
have
been
thought
of
pins
cologne
sewing
materials
all
sorts
of
softening
washes
for
the
skin
to
be
used
on
the
alkaline
plains
sponges
to
wet
and
fasten
into
the
crown
of
hats
other
sponges
to
breathe
through
medicines
of
various
kinds
and
arnica
whisk
brooms
piles
of
magazines
and
novels
telegraph
blanks
stationery
nothing
seemed
forgotten
clover
said
that
it
reminded
her
of
the
mother
of
the
swiss
family
robinson
and
that
wonderful
bag
out
of
which
everything
was
produced
that
could
be
thought
of
from
a
grand
piano
to
a
bottle
of
pickles
and
after
that
robinson
became
dayton
pet
name
among
her
she
adopted
it
cheerfully
and
her
wonderful
bag
proving
quite
as
unfailing
and
trustworthy
as
that
of
her
prototype
the
title
seemed
justified
pretty
soon
after
starting
came
their
first
dinner
on
the
car
such
a
nice
one
soup
roast
chicken
and
lamb
green
peas
new
potatoes
stewed
tomato
all
as
hot
and
as
perfectly
served
as
if
they
had
been
on
dry
land
as
amy
phrased
it
there
was
fresh
curly
lettuce
too
with
mayonnaise
dressing
and
a
dessert
of
strawberries
and
the
latter
made
and
frozen
on
the
car
whose
resources
seemed
inexhaustible
the
cook
had
been
attached
to
car
for
some
years
and
had
a
celebrity
on
his
own
road
for
the
preparation
of
certain
dishes
which
no
one
else
could
do
as
well
however
many
markets
and
refrigerators
and
kitchen
ranges
might
be
at
command
one
of
these
dishes
was
a
peculiar
form
of
cracked
wheat
made
crisp
and
savory
after
some
mysterious
fashion
and
eaten
with
thick
cream
like
most
the
cook
liked
to
do
the
things
in
which
he
excelled
and
finding
that
it
was
admired
he
gave
the
party
this
delicious
wheat
every
morning
the
car
seems
paved
with
bottles
of
apollinaris
and
with
lemons
wrote
katy
to
her
father
there
seems
no
limit
to
the
supply
just
as
surely
as
it
grows
warm
and
dusty
and
we
begin
to
remember
that
we
are
thirsty
a
tinkle
is
heard
and
bayard
appears
with
a
tray
iced
lemonade
if
you
please
made
with
apollinaris
water
with
strawberries
floating
on
top
what
do
you
think
of
that
at
thirty
miles
an
hour
bayard
is
the
colored
butler
the
cook
is
named
roland
we
have
a
fine
flavor
of
peers
and
paladins
among
us
you
perceive
the
first
day
out
was
cool
and
delicious
and
we
had
no
dust
at
six
we
stopped
at
a
junction
and
our
car
was
detached
and
run
off
on
a
siding
this
was
because
dayton
had
business
in
the
place
and
we
were
to
wait
and
be
taken
on
by
the
next
express
train
soon
after
midnight
at
first
they
ran
us
down
to
a
pretty
place
by
the
side
of
the
river
where
it
was
cool
and
we
could
look
out
on
the
water
and
a
green
bank
opposite
and
we
thought
we
were
going
to
have
such
a
nice
night
but
the
authorities
changed
their
minds
and
presently
to
our
deep
disgust
a
locomotive
came
puffing
down
the
road
clawed
us
up
ran
us
back
and
finally
left
us
in
the
middle
of
innumerable
tracks
and
switches
just
where
all
the
freight
trains
came
in
and
met
all
night
long
they
were
arriving
and
going
out
cars
loaded
with
cattle
cars
loaded
with
sheep
with
pigs
such
bleatings
and
mooings
and
gruntings
i
never
heard
in
all
my
life
before
i
could
think
of
nothing
but
that
verse
in
the
psalms
bulls
of
bashan
have
beset
me
round
and
could
only
hope
that
the
poor
animals
did
not
feel
half
as
badly
as
they
sounded
then
long
before
light
as
we
lay
listening
to
these
lamentable
roarings
and
grunts
and
quite
unable
to
sleep
for
heat
and
noise
came
the
blessed
express
and
presently
we
were
away
out
of
all
the
din
with
the
fresh
air
of
the
prairie
blowing
in
and
in
no
time
at
all
we
were
so
sound
asleep
that
it
seemed
but
a
minute
before
morning
phil
slumbers
lasted
so
long
that
we
had
to
breakfast
without
him
for
dayton
would
not
let
us
wake
him
up
you
ca
think
how
kind
she
is
and
dayton
too
and
this
way
of
travelling
is
so
easy
and
delightful
that
it
scarcely
seems
to
tire
one
at
all
phil
has
borne
the
journey
wonderfully
well
so
far
at
omaha
on
the
evening
of
the
second
day
clover
future
matron
and
adviser
watson
was
to
join
them
she
had
been
telegraphed
to
from
chicago
and
had
replied
so
that
they
knew
she
was
expecting
them
clover
thoughts
were
so
occupied
with
curiosity
as
to
what
she
would
turn
out
to
be
that
she
scarcely
realized
that
she
was
crossing
the
mississippi
for
the
first
time
and
she
gave
scant
attention
to
the
low
bluffs
which
bound
the
river
and
on
which
the
indians
used
to
hold
their
councils
in
those
dim
days
when
there
was
still
an
undiscovered
west
set
down
in
geographies
and
atlases
as
soon
as
they
reached
the
omaha
side
of
the
river
she
and
katy
jumped
down
from
the
car
and
immediately
found
themselves
face
to
face
with
an
little
old
lady
with
white
hair
frizzled
and
banged
over
a
puckered
forehead
and
a
pair
of
watery
blue
eyes
peering
from
beneath
evidently
in
search
of
somebody
her
hands
were
quite
full
of
bags
and
parcels
and
a
little
heap
of
similar
articles
lay
on
the
platform
near
her
of
which
she
seemed
afraid
to
lose
sight
for
a
moment
oh
is
it
miss
carr
was
her
first
salutation
i
watson
i
thought
it
might
be
you
from
the
fact
that
you
got
out
of
that
car
and
it
seems
rather
different
i
am
quite
relieved
to
see
you
i
did
know
but
something
my
daughter
she
said
to
me
as
i
was
coming
away
mother
do
lose
yourself
whatever
you
do
it
seems
quite
wild
to
think
of
you
in
canyon
this
and
canyon
that
and
the
garden
of
the
gods
do
get
some
one
to
keep
an
eye
on
you
or
we
shall
never
hear
of
you
again
you
it
quite
a
comfort
that
you
have
got
here
i
supposed
you
would
but
the
uncertainty
oh
dear
that
man
is
carrying
off
my
trunks
please
run
after
him
and
tell
him
to
bring
them
back
it
all
right
he
the
porter
explained
dayton
did
you
get
your
checks
for
denver
or
st
helen
oh
i
have
any
checks
yet
i
did
know
which
it
ought
to
be
so
i
waited
till
miss
carr
and
her
brother
would
see
to
it
for
me
i
knew
and
i
wrote
my
daughter
my
friend
peters
i
been
staying
with
her
you
know
was
sick
in
bed
and
i
would
let
dear
me
what
has
that
gentleman
gone
off
for
in
such
a
hurry
he
has
gone
to
get
your
checks
said
clover
divided
between
diversion
and
dismay
at
this
specimen
of
her
future
matron
we
only
stay
here
a
few
minutes
i
believe
do
you
know
exactly
when
the
train
starts
mrs
watson
no
dear
i
do
i
never
know
anything
about
trains
and
things
like
that
somebody
always
has
to
tell
me
and
put
me
on
the
cars
i
shall
trust
to
you
and
your
brother
to
do
that
now
it
a
great
comfort
to
have
a
gentleman
to
see
to
things
for
you
a
gentleman
poor
philly
dayton
now
came
back
to
them
it
was
lucky
that
he
knew
the
station
and
was
used
to
the
ways
of
railroads
for
it
appeared
that
watson
had
made
no
arrangements
whatever
for
her
journey
but
had
blindly
devolved
the
care
of
herself
and
her
belongings
on
her
young
friends
as
she
called
clover
and
phil
she
had
no
sleeping
section
secured
and
no
tickets
and
they
had
to
be
procured
at
the
last
moment
and
in
such
a
scramble
that
the
last
of
her
parcels
was
handed
on
to
the
platform
by
a
porter
at
full
run
after
the
train
was
in
motion
she
was
not
at
all
flurried
by
the
commotion
though
others
were
and
blandly
repeated
that
she
knew
from
the
beginning
that
all
would
be
right
as
soon
as
miss
carr
and
her
brother
arrived
dayton
had
sent
a
courteous
invitation
to
the
old
lady
to
come
to
car
for
tea
but
watson
did
not
at
all
like
being
left
alone
meantime
and
held
fast
to
clover
when
the
others
moved
to
go
i
used
to
being
a
good
deal
looked
after
she
explained
all
the
family
know
my
ways
and
they
never
do
let
me
be
alone
much
i
taken
faint
sometimes
and
the
doctor
says
it
my
heart
or
something
the
cause
of
it
so
my
daughter
she
you
ai
going
my
dear
are
you
i
must
look
after
my
brother
said
poor
clover
he
been
ill
you
know
and
this
is
the
time
for
his
medicine
dear
me
is
he
ill
said
watson
in
an
aggrieved
tone
i
prepared
for
that
you
have
your
hands
pretty
full
with
him
and
me
both
wo
you
for
though
i
well
enough
just
now
there
no
knowing
what
a
day
may
bring
forth
and
you
all
i
have
to
depend
upon
sure
you
must
go
it
seems
as
if
your
sister
worthing
is
that
the
name
might
see
to
the
medicine
and
give
you
a
little
freedom
do
let
your
brother
be
too
exacting
dear
it
is
the
worst
thing
for
a
young
man
i
sit
here
a
little
while
and
then
i
the
conductor
will
help
me
i
suppose
or
perhaps
that
gentleman
might
i
hate
to
be
left
by
myself
these
were
the
last
words
which
clover
heard
as
she
escaped
she
entered
car
with
such
a
rueful
and
disgusted
countenance
that
everybody
burst
out
laughing
what
is
the
matter
miss
clover
asked
dayton
has
your
old
lady
left
something
after
all
do
call
her
old
lady
i
supposed
to
be
her
young
lady
under
her
charge
said
clover
trying
to
smile
but
the
moment
she
got
katy
to
herself
she
burst
out
with
my
dear
what
i
going
to
do
it
really
too
dreadful
instead
of
some
one
to
help
me
which
is
what
papa
meant
watson
seems
to
depend
on
me
to
take
all
the
care
of
her
and
she
says
she
has
fainting
fits
and
disease
of
the
heart
how
can
i
take
care
of
her
phil
needs
me
all
the
time
and
a
great
deal
more
than
she
does
i
do
see
how
i
can
you
ca
of
course
you
are
here
to
take
care
of
phil
and
it
is
out
of
the
question
that
you
should
have
another
person
to
look
after
but
i
think
you
must
mistake
watson
clovy
i
know
that
hall
wrote
plainly
about
phil
illness
for
she
showed
me
the
letter
just
wait
till
you
hear
her
talk
cried
the
exasperated
clover
you
will
find
that
i
did
mistake
her
at
all
oh
why
did
hall
interfere
it
would
all
seem
so
easy
in
comparison
so
perfectly
easy
if
only
philly
and
i
were
alone
together
katy
thought
that
clover
was
fretted
and
disposed
to
exaggerate
but
after
watson
joined
them
a
little
later
she
changed
her
opinion
the
old
lady
was
an
inveterate
talker
and
her
habit
of
only
half
finishing
her
sentences
made
it
difficult
to
follow
the
meanderings
of
her
rambling
discourse
it
turned
largely
on
her
daughter
phillips
her
husband
children
house
furniture
habits
tastes
and
the
phillips
connection
generally
she
the
only
one
i
got
she
informed
dayton
so
of
course
she
to
me
jane
phillips
that
henry
youngest
sister
often
says
that
really
of
all
the
women
she
ever
knew
ellen
is
the
most
and
there
plenty
to
do
always
of
course
with
three
children
and
such
a
large
elegant
house
and
company
coming
all
the
it
lucky
that
there
plenty
to
do
with
henry
very
liberal
he
likes
to
have
things
nice
so
ellen
she
why
when
i
was
packing
up
to
come
away
he
brought
me
that
there
in
my
bag
oh
it
in
my
other
bag
never
mind
i
show
it
to
you
some
other
time
solid
silver
you
know
bigelow
and
kennard
their
things
always
good
though
expensive
and
my
he
said
going
to
a
fruit
country
and
peters
does
think
there
is
so
much
fruit
though
all
sent
on
from
california
as
i
wrote
and
i
guess
ellen
and
henry
were
surprised
to
hear
it
katy
held
serious
counsel
with
herself
that
night
as
to
what
she
should
do
about
this
extraordinary
guide
philosopher
and
friend
whom
the
fates
had
provided
for
clover
she
saw
that
her
father
from
very
had
made
a
mistake
and
complicated
clover
inevitable
cares
with
a
most
undesirable
companion
who
would
add
to
rather
than
relieve
them
she
could
not
decide
what
was
best
to
do
and
in
fact
the
time
was
short
for
doing
anything
for
the
next
evening
would
bring
them
to
denver
and
poor
clover
must
be
left
to
face
the
situation
by
herself
as
best
she
might
katy
finally
concluded
to
write
her
father
plainly
how
things
stood
and
beg
him
to
set
clover
mind
quite
at
rest
as
to
any
responsibility
for
watson
and
also
to
have
a
talk
with
that
lady
herself
and
explain
matters
as
clearly
as
she
could
it
seemed
all
that
was
in
her
power
next
day
the
party
woke
to
a
wonderful
sense
of
lightness
and
exhilaration
which
no
one
could
account
for
till
the
conductor
told
them
that
the
apparently
level
plain
over
which
they
were
speeding
was
more
than
four
thousand
feet
above
the
sea
it
seemed
impossible
to
believe
it
hour
by
hour
they
climbed
but
the
climb
was
imperceptible
now
four
thousand
six
hundred
feet
of
elevation
was
reported
now
four
thousand
eight
hundred
at
last
above
five
thousand
and
still
there
seemed
about
them
nothing
but
a
vast
expanse
of
flat
levels
the
of
nebraska
there
was
little
that
was
beautiful
in
the
landscape
which
was
principally
made
up
of
wide
reaches
of
sand
dotted
with
cactus
and
and
with
the
droll
burrows
of
the
who
could
be
seen
gravely
sitting
on
the
roofs
of
their
houses
or
turning
sudden
somersaults
in
at
the
holes
on
top
as
the
train
whizzed
by
they
passed
and
repassed
long
links
of
a
broad
shallow
river
which
the
maps
showed
to
be
the
platte
and
which
seemed
to
be
made
of
sand
to
water
now
and
again
mounted
horsemen
appeared
in
the
distance
whom
dayton
said
were
but
no
cows
were
visible
and
the
rapidly
moving
figures
were
neither
as
picturesque
nor
as
formidable
as
they
had
expected
them
to
be
flowers
were
still
abundant
and
their
splendid
masses
gave
the
charm
of
color
to
the
rather
arid
landscape
soon
after
noon
dim
blue
outlines
came
into
view
which
grew
rapidly
bolder
and
more
distinct
and
revealed
themselves
as
the
rocky
mountains
the
backbone
of
the
american
continent
of
which
we
have
all
heard
so
much
in
geographies
and
the
newspapers
it
was
delightful
in
spite
of
dust
and
glare
to
sit
with
that
sweep
of
magnificent
air
rushing
into
their
lungs
and
watch
the
great
ranges
grow
and
grow
and
deepen
in
hue
till
they
seemed
close
at
hand
to
katy
they
were
like
enchanted
land
somewhere
on
the
other
side
of
them
on
the
dim
pacific
coast
her
husband
was
waiting
for
her
to
come
and
the
wheels
seemed
to
revolve
with
a
regular
rhythmic
beat
to
the
cadence
of
the
old
scotch
song
and
will
i
see
his
face
again
and
will
i
hear
him
speak
but
to
clover
the
wheels
sang
something
less
jubilant
and
she
studied
the
mountains
on
her
little
and
measured
their
distance
from
burnet
with
a
sigh
they
were
the
walls
of
what
seemed
to
her
a
sort
of
prison
as
she
realized
that
presently
she
should
be
left
alone
among
them
katy
and
polly
gone
and
these
new
friends
whom
she
had
learned
to
like
so
much
left
alone
with
phil
and
what
was
worse
with
watson
there
was
a
comic
side
to
the
latter
situation
undoubtedly
but
at
the
moment
she
could
not
enjoy
it
katy
carried
out
her
intention
she
made
a
long
call
on
watson
in
her
section
and
listened
patiently
to
her
bemoanings
over
the
noise
of
the
car
which
had
kept
her
from
sleeping
the
lady
in
gray
over
there
who
had
taken
such
a
long
time
to
dress
in
the
morning
that
she
watson
could
not
get
into
the
at
the
precise
moment
that
she
wished
the
newspaper
boy
who
would
not
let
her
just
glance
over
the
denver
republican
unless
she
bought
and
paid
for
it
and
i
only
wanted
to
see
the
washington
news
my
dear
and
something
about
a
tin
wedding
in
east
dedham
my
mother
came
from
there
and
i
recognized
one
of
the
names
and
but
he
took
it
away
quite
rudely
and
when
i
complained
the
conductor
would
attend
to
what
i
and
the
bad
piece
of
beefsteak
which
had
been
brought
for
her
breakfast
at
the
katy
soothed
and
comforted
to
the
best
of
her
ability
and
then
plunged
into
her
subject
explaining
phil
very
delicate
condition
and
the
necessity
for
constant
watchfulness
on
the
part
of
clover
and
saying
most
distinctly
and
in
the
plainest
of
english
that
watson
must
not
expect
clover
to
take
care
of
her
too
the
old
lady
was
not
in
the
least
offended
but
her
replies
were
so
incoherent
that
katy
was
not
sure
that
she
understood
the
matter
any
better
for
the
explanation
certainly
my
dear
certainly
your
brother
does
appear
so
very
sick
but
he
must
be
looked
after
of
course
boys
always
ought
to
be
remind
your
sister
if
she
seems
to
be
forgetting
anything
i
hope
i
shall
keep
well
myself
so
as
not
to
be
a
worry
to
her
and
we
can
take
little
excursions
together
i
dare
say
girls
always
like
to
go
and
of
course
an
older
person
oh
no
your
brother
wo
need
her
so
much
as
you
think
he
seems
pretty
strong
to
me
and
you
must
worry
about
them
worthing
we
shall
all
get
on
very
well
i
sure
provided
i
do
break
down
and
i
guess
i
though
they
say
almost
every
one
does
in
this
air
why
we
shall
be
as
high
up
as
the
top
of
mount
washington
katy
went
back
to
in
despair
to
comfort
herself
with
a
long
confidential
chat
with
clover
in
which
she
exhorted
her
not
to
let
herself
be
imposed
upon
be
good
to
her
and
make
her
as
happy
as
you
can
but
do
feel
bound
to
wait
on
her
and
run
her
errands
i
am
sure
papa
would
not
wish
it
and
it
will
half
kill
you
if
you
attempt
it
phil
till
he
gets
stronger
is
all
you
can
manage
you
not
only
have
to
nurse
him
you
know
but
to
keep
him
happy
it
so
bad
for
him
to
mope
you
want
all
your
time
to
read
with
him
and
take
walks
and
drives
that
is
if
there
are
any
carriages
at
helen
do
let
watson
seize
upon
you
clover
i
awfully
afraid
that
she
means
to
and
i
can
see
that
she
is
a
real
old
woman
of
the
sea
once
she
gets
on
your
back
you
will
never
be
able
to
throw
her
off
she
shall
not
get
on
my
back
said
clover
straightening
her
small
figure
but
does
it
seem
that
i
should
have
an
old
woman
of
the
sea
to
grapple
with
as
well
as
phil
provoking
things
are
apt
to
seem
unnecessary
i
fancy
you
must
let
yourself
get
worried
dear
clovy
the
old
lady
means
kindly
enough
i
think
only
she
naturally
tiresome
and
has
become
helpless
from
habit
be
nice
to
her
but
hold
your
own
is
the
first
law
of
nature
just
at
dusk
the
train
reached
denver
and
the
dreaded
moment
of
parting
came
there
were
kisses
and
tearful
but
not
much
time
was
allowed
for
either
the
last
glimpse
that
clover
had
of
katy
was
as
the
train
moved
away
when
she
put
her
head
far
out
of
the
window
of
car
to
kiss
her
hand
once
more
and
call
back
in
a
tone
oracular
and
solemn
enough
to
suit
king
charles
the
first
his
own
admonitory
word
remember
chapter
vi
helen
never
in
her
life
had
clover
felt
so
small
and
incompetent
and
so
very
very
young
as
when
the
train
with
car
attached
vanished
from
sight
and
left
her
on
the
platform
of
the
denver
station
with
her
two
companions
there
they
stood
phil
on
one
side
tired
and
drooping
watson
on
the
other
blinking
anxiously
about
both
evidently
depending
on
her
for
guidance
and
direction
for
one
moment
a
sort
of
pale
consternation
swept
over
her
then
the
sense
of
the
inevitable
and
the
nobler
sense
of
responsibility
came
to
her
aid
she
rallied
herself
the
color
returned
to
her
cheeks
and
she
said
bravely
to
watson
now
if
you
and
phil
will
just
sit
down
on
that
settee
over
there
and
make
yourselves
comfortable
i
will
find
out
about
the
trains
for
helen
and
where
we
had
better
go
for
the
night
watson
and
phil
seated
themselves
accordingly
and
clover
stood
for
a
moment
considering
what
she
should
do
outside
was
a
wilderness
of
tracks
up
and
down
which
trains
were
puffing
in
obedience
doubtless
to
some
law
understood
by
themselves
but
which
looked
to
the
uninitiated
like
the
direst
confusion
inside
the
station
the
scene
was
equally
confused
travellers
just
arrived
and
just
going
away
were
rushing
in
and
out
porters
and
with
their
hands
full
hurried
to
and
fro
no
one
seemed
at
leisure
to
answer
a
question
or
even
to
listen
to
one
just
then
she
caught
sight
of
a
shrewd
yet
face
looking
at
her
from
the
window
of
the
and
without
hesitation
she
went
up
to
the
enclosure
it
was
the
whose
eye
she
had
caught
he
was
at
liberty
at
the
moment
and
his
answers
to
her
inquiries
though
brief
were
polite
and
kind
people
generally
did
soften
to
clover
there
was
such
an
odd
and
pretty
contrast
between
her
girlish
appealing
look
and
her
dignified
little
manner
like
a
child
trying
to
be
stately
but
only
succeeding
in
being
primly
sweet
the
next
train
for
helen
left
at
nine
in
the
morning
it
seemed
and
the
recommended
the
sherman
house
as
a
hotel
where
they
would
be
very
comfortable
for
the
night
the
omnibus
is
just
outside
he
said
encouragingly
you
find
it
a
house
best
there
is
west
of
chicago
from
the
east
just
so
you
not
seen
our
yet
i
suppose
denver
folks
are
rather
proud
of
it
biggest
in
the
country
except
the
new
one
in
new
york
hope
you
find
time
to
visit
it
i
should
like
to
said
clover
but
we
are
here
for
only
one
night
my
brother
been
ill
and
we
are
going
directly
on
to
helen
i
very
much
obliged
to
you
her
look
of
pretty
honest
gratitude
seemed
to
touch
the
heart
of
the
he
opened
the
door
of
his
fastness
and
came
out
actually
came
out
and
with
a
long
shrill
whistle
summoned
a
porter
whom
he
addressed
as
here
you
pat
and
bade
take
this
lady
things
and
put
them
into
the
for
the
sherman
look
sharp
now
and
see
that
she
all
right
then
to
clover
you
find
it
very
comfortable
at
the
sherman
miss
and
i
hope
have
a
good
night
if
you
come
to
me
in
the
morning
i
explain
about
the
baggage
transfer
clover
thanked
this
obliging
being
again
and
rejoined
her
party
who
were
patiently
sitting
where
she
had
left
them
dear
me
said
watson
as
the
omnibus
rolled
off
i
had
no
idea
that
denver
was
such
a
large
place
street
cars
too
well
i
declare
and
what
nice
shops
said
clover
equally
surprised
her
ideas
had
been
rather
vague
as
to
what
was
to
be
expected
in
the
close
neighborhood
of
the
rocky
mountains
but
she
knew
that
denver
had
only
existed
a
few
years
and
was
prepared
to
find
everything
looking
rough
and
unfinished
why
they
have
restaurants
here
and
jewellers
shops
she
cried
look
phil
what
a
nice
grocery
we
need
have
packed
all
those
oatmeal
biscuits
if
only
we
had
known
and
electric
lights
how
wonderful
but
of
course
helen
is
quite
different
their
amazement
increased
when
they
reached
the
hotel
and
were
taken
in
a
large
to
order
dinner
from
a
bill
of
fare
which
seemed
to
include
every
known
luxury
from
oregon
salmon
and
lake
superior
to
frozen
sherbets
and
california
peaches
and
apricots
but
wonderment
yielded
to
fatigue
and
again
as
clover
fell
asleep
she
was
conscious
of
a
deep
depression
what
had
she
undertaken
to
do
how
could
she
do
it
but
a
night
of
sound
sleep
followed
by
such
a
morning
of
unclouded
brilliance
as
is
seldom
seen
east
of
colorado
banished
these
misgivings
courage
rose
under
the
stimulus
of
such
air
and
sunshine
i
must
just
live
for
each
day
as
it
comes
said
little
clover
to
herself
do
my
best
as
things
turn
up
keep
phil
happy
and
satisfy
watson
if
i
can
and
not
worry
about
or
yesterdays
that
is
the
only
safe
way
and
i
wo
forget
if
i
can
help
it
with
these
wise
resolves
she
ran
down
stairs
looking
so
blithe
and
bright
that
phil
cheered
at
the
sight
of
her
and
lost
the
long
morning
face
he
had
got
up
with
while
even
watson
caught
the
contagion
and
became
fairly
hopeful
and
content
a
little
leaven
of
and
good
heart
in
one
often
avails
to
lighten
the
heaviness
of
many
the
distance
between
denver
and
helen
is
less
than
a
hundred
miles
but
as
the
railroad
has
to
climb
and
cross
a
range
of
hills
between
two
and
three
thousand
feet
high
the
journey
occupies
several
hours
as
the
train
gradually
rose
higher
and
higher
the
travellers
began
to
get
wide
views
first
of
the
magnificent
panorama
of
mountains
which
lies
to
the
northwest
of
denver
sixty
miles
away
with
long
peak
in
the
middle
and
after
crossing
the
crest
of
the
divide
where
a
blue
little
lake
rimmed
with
sparkled
in
the
sun
of
the
more
southern
ranges
after
a
while
they
found
themselves
running
parallel
to
a
mountain
chain
of
strange
and
beautiful
forms
green
almost
to
the
top
and
intersected
with
deep
ravines
and
cliffs
which
the
conductor
informed
them
were
canyons
they
seemed
quite
near
at
hand
for
their
bases
sank
into
low
rounded
hills
covered
with
woods
these
melted
into
undulating
and
those
again
into
a
narrow
strip
of
plain
across
which
ran
the
track
flowers
innumerable
grew
on
this
plain
mixed
with
grass
of
a
tawny
there
were
cactuses
red
and
yellow
scarlet
and
white
gillias
tall
spikes
of
yucca
in
full
bloom
and
masses
of
a
superb
white
poppy
with
an
centre
whose
foliage
was
prickly
like
that
of
the
thistle
here
and
there
on
the
higher
uplands
appeared
strange
rock
shapes
of
red
and
pink
and
pale
yellow
which
looked
like
castles
with
towers
and
pinnacles
or
like
primitive
fortifications
clover
thought
it
all
strangely
beautiful
but
watson
found
fault
with
it
as
queer
it
looks
unnatural
somehow
she
objected
not
a
bit
like
the
east
red
never
was
a
favorite
color
of
mine
ellen
had
a
magenta
bonnet
once
and
it
always
worried
but
henry
liked
it
so
of
course
people
ca
see
things
the
same
way
now
the
green
hat
she
had
winter
before
last
was
do
you
think
those
mountains
are
dreadfully
bright
and
distinct
i
do
like
such
rocks
even
the
green
looks
red
somehow
i
like
soft
hazy
mountains
like
blue
hill
and
wachusett
ellen
spent
a
summer
up
at
princeton
once
it
was
when
little
cynthia
had
diphtheria
she
named
after
me
you
know
and
henry
he
thought
but
i
do
like
the
staring
kind
like
these
and
somehow
those
buildings
which
the
conductor
says
are
not
buildings
but
rocks
make
my
flesh
creep
they
be
scrumptious
places
to
repel
attacks
of
indians
from
observed
phil
two
or
three
scouts
with
up
on
that
scarlet
wall
there
could
keep
off
a
hundred
piutes
i
do
feel
that
way
a
bit
clover
was
saying
to
watson
i
like
the
color
it
so
rich
and
i
think
the
mountains
are
perfectly
beautiful
if
helen
is
like
this
i
am
going
to
like
it
i
know
helen
when
they
reached
it
proved
to
be
very
much
like
this
only
more
so
as
phil
remarked
the
little
settlement
was
built
on
a
low
plateau
facing
the
mountains
and
here
the
plain
narrowed
and
the
beautiful
range
seen
through
the
clear
atmosphere
seemed
only
a
mile
or
two
away
though
in
reality
it
was
eight
or
ten
to
the
east
the
plain
widened
again
into
great
upland
sweeps
like
the
kentish
downs
with
here
and
there
a
belt
of
black
woodland
and
here
and
there
a
line
of
low
bluffs
viewed
from
a
height
with
the
sweeping
across
it
it
had
the
extent
and
splendor
of
the
sea
and
looked
very
much
like
it
the
town
seen
from
below
seemed
a
larger
place
than
clover
had
expected
and
again
she
felt
the
creeping
nervous
feeling
come
over
her
but
before
the
train
had
fairly
stopped
a
brisk
active
little
man
jumped
on
board
and
walking
into
the
car
began
to
look
about
him
with
keen
observant
eyes
after
one
sweeping
glance
he
came
straight
to
where
clover
was
collecting
her
bags
and
parcels
held
out
his
hand
and
said
in
a
pleasant
voice
i
think
this
must
be
miss
carr
i
am
hope
he
went
on
your
father
telegraphed
when
you
were
to
leave
chicago
and
i
have
come
down
to
two
or
three
trains
in
the
hope
of
meeting
you
have
you
indeed
said
clover
with
a
rush
of
relief
how
very
kind
of
you
and
so
papa
telegraphed
i
never
thought
of
that
phil
here
is
hope
papa
friend
hope
mrs
watson
this
is
really
a
very
agreeable
attention
your
coming
to
meet
us
said
watson
a
very
agreeable
attention
indeed
well
i
shall
write
ellen
that
my
daughter
phillips
you
know
that
before
we
had
got
out
of
the
cars
a
gentleman
and
though
i
always
been
in
the
habit
of
going
about
a
good
deal
it
always
been
in
the
east
of
course
and
things
are
what
are
we
going
to
do
first
hope
miss
carr
has
a
great
deal
of
energy
for
a
girl
but
naturally
i
suppose
there
an
hotel
at
helen
ellen
is
rather
particular
where
i
stay
your
age
mother
you
must
be
made
comfortable
whatever
it
costs
she
says
and
so
i
an
only
daughter
you
know
but
you
attend
to
all
those
things
for
us
now
doctor
there
quite
a
good
hotel
said
hope
his
eyes
twinkling
a
little
i
show
it
to
you
as
we
drive
up
you
find
it
very
comfortable
if
you
prefer
to
go
there
but
for
these
young
people
i
taken
rooms
at
a
a
quieter
and
less
expensive
place
i
thought
it
was
what
your
father
would
prefer
he
added
in
a
lower
tone
to
clover
i
am
sure
he
would
she
replied
but
watson
broke
in
oh
i
shall
go
wherever
miss
carr
goes
she
under
my
care
you
know
though
at
the
same
time
i
must
say
that
in
the
long
run
i
have
generally
found
that
the
most
expensive
places
turn
out
the
cheapest
as
ellen
often
says
get
the
best
and
what
do
they
charge
at
this
hotel
that
you
speak
of
dr
hope
the
shoshone
house
about
dollars
a
week
i
think
if
you
make
a
permanent
arrangement
that
a
good
deal
remarked
watson
meditatively
while
clover
hastened
to
say
it
is
a
great
deal
more
than
phil
and
i
can
spend
hope
i
am
glad
you
have
chosen
the
other
place
for
us
i
suppose
it
better
admitted
mm
watson
but
when
they
gained
the
top
of
the
hill
and
a
picturesque
structure
was
pointed
out
as
the
shoshone
her
regrets
returned
and
she
began
again
to
murmur
that
very
often
the
most
expensive
places
turned
out
the
cheapest
in
the
end
and
that
it
stood
to
reason
that
they
must
be
the
best
hope
rather
encouraged
this
view
and
proposed
that
she
should
stop
and
look
at
some
rooms
but
no
she
could
not
desert
her
young
charges
and
would
go
on
though
at
the
same
time
she
must
say
that
her
opinion
as
an
older
person
who
had
seen
more
of
the
world
was
she
was
used
to
being
consulted
why
addy
phillips
would
order
that
crushed
strawberry
bengaline
of
hers
till
watson
saw
the
sample
and
but
girls
had
their
own
ideas
and
were
bound
to
carry
them
out
ellen
always
said
so
and
for
her
part
she
knew
her
duty
and
meant
to
do
it
hope
flashed
one
rapid
comical
look
at
clover
western
life
sharpens
the
wits
if
it
does
nothing
else
and
westerners
as
a
general
thing
become
pretty
good
judges
of
character
it
had
not
taken
ten
minutes
for
the
little
doctor
to
fathom
the
peculiarities
of
chaperone
and
he
would
most
willingly
have
planted
her
in
the
congenial
soil
of
the
shoshone
house
which
would
have
provided
a
wider
field
for
her
restlessness
and
and
many
more
people
to
listen
to
her
narratives
and
sympathize
with
her
complaints
but
it
was
no
use
she
was
resolved
to
abide
by
the
fortunes
of
her
young
friends
while
this
discussion
was
proceeding
the
carriage
had
been
rolling
down
a
wide
street
running
along
the
edge
of
the
plateau
opposite
the
mountain
range
pretty
houses
stood
on
either
side
in
green
shaded
with
roses
and
piazzas
and
grass
why
it
looks
like
a
new
england
town
said
clover
amazed
i
thought
there
were
no
trees
here
yes
i
know
said
hope
smiling
you
came
like
most
eastern
people
prepared
to
find
us
sitting
in
the
middle
of
a
sandy
waste
on
cactus
pincushions
picking
our
teeth
with
and
with
no
neighbors
but
indians
and
grizzly
bears
well
sixteen
years
ago
we
could
have
filled
the
bill
pretty
well
then
there
was
not
a
single
house
in
helen
not
even
a
tent
and
not
one
of
the
trees
that
you
see
here
had
been
planted
now
we
have
three
railroads
meeting
at
our
depot
a
population
of
nearly
seven
thousand
electric
lights
telephones
a
good
a
system
of
works
which
brings
spring
water
into
the
town
from
six
miles
away
in
short
pretty
much
all
the
modern
conveniences
but
what
made
the
place
grow
so
fast
asked
clover
if
i
may
be
allowed
a
professional
pun
it
is
built
up
on
coughings
it
is
a
town
for
invalids
half
the
people
here
came
out
for
the
benefit
of
their
lungs
is
that
rather
depressing
it
would
be
more
so
if
most
of
them
did
not
look
so
well
that
no
one
would
suspect
them
of
being
ill
here
we
are
clover
looked
out
eagerly
there
was
nothing
picturesque
about
the
house
at
whose
gate
the
carriage
had
stopped
it
was
a
large
shabby
structure
with
a
piazza
above
as
well
as
below
and
on
these
piazzas
various
people
were
sitting
who
looked
unmistakably
ill
the
front
of
the
house
however
commanded
the
fine
mountain
view
you
see
explained
hope
drawing
clover
aside
that
are
both
comfortable
and
reasonable
are
rather
scarce
at
helen
i
know
all
about
the
table
here
and
the
drainage
and
the
view
is
desirable
and
marsh
who
keeps
the
house
is
one
of
the
best
women
we
have
she
from
down
your
way
too
barnstable
i
think
clover
privately
wondered
how
barnstable
could
be
classed
as
down
the
same
way
with
burnet
not
having
learned
as
yet
that
to
the
soaring
western
mind
that
insignificant
fraction
of
the
whole
country
known
as
the
east
means
anywhere
from
maine
to
michigan
and
that
such
trivial
geographical
differences
as
exist
between
the
different
sections
seem
scarcely
worth
consideration
when
compared
with
the
vast
spaces
which
lie
beyond
toward
the
setting
sun
but
perhaps
hope
was
only
trying
to
tease
her
for
he
twinkled
amusedly
at
her
puzzled
face
as
he
went
on
i
think
you
can
make
yourselves
comfortable
here
it
was
the
best
i
could
do
but
your
old
lady
would
be
much
better
suited
at
the
shoshone
and
i
wish
she
go
there
clover
could
not
help
laughing
i
wish
that
people
would
persist
in
calling
watson
my
old
lady
she
thought
marsh
a
person
came
to
meet
them
as
they
entered
she
showed
clover
and
phil
their
rooms
which
had
been
secured
for
them
and
then
carried
watson
off
to
look
at
another
which
she
could
have
if
she
liked
the
rooms
were
on
the
third
floor
a
big
front
one
for
phil
with
a
sunny
south
window
and
two
others
looking
towards
the
west
and
the
mountains
and
opening
from
it
a
smaller
room
for
clover
your
brother
ought
to
live
in
fresh
air
both
in
doors
and
out
said
hope
and
i
thought
this
large
room
would
answer
as
a
sort
of
sitting
place
for
both
of
you
it
ever
so
nice
and
we
are
both
more
obliged
to
you
than
we
can
say
replied
clover
holding
out
her
hand
as
the
doctor
rose
to
go
he
gave
a
pleased
little
laugh
as
he
shook
it
that
all
right
he
said
i
owe
your
father
children
any
good
turn
in
my
power
for
he
was
a
good
friend
to
me
when
i
was
a
poor
boy
just
beginning
and
needed
friends
that
my
house
with
the
red
roof
miss
clover
you
see
how
near
it
is
and
please
remember
that
besides
the
care
of
this
boy
here
i
in
charge
of
you
too
and
have
the
inside
track
of
the
rest
of
the
friends
you
are
going
to
make
in
colorado
i
expect
to
be
called
on
whenever
you
want
anything
or
feel
lonesome
or
are
at
a
loss
in
any
way
my
wife
is
coming
to
see
you
as
soon
as
you
have
had
your
dinner
and
got
settled
a
little
she
sent
those
to
you
indicating
a
vase
on
the
table
filled
with
flowers
they
were
of
a
sort
which
clover
had
never
seen
before
deep
blossoms
of
beautiful
pale
purple
and
white
oh
what
are
they
she
called
after
the
doctor
anemones
he
answered
and
was
gone
what
a
dear
nice
kind
man
cried
clover
is
it
delightful
to
have
a
friend
right
off
who
knows
papa
and
does
things
for
us
because
we
are
papa
children
you
like
him
do
you
phil
and
do
you
like
your
room
yes
only
it
does
seem
fair
that
i
should
have
the
largest
oh
yes
it
is
perfectly
fair
i
never
shall
want
to
be
in
mine
except
when
i
am
dressing
or
asleep
i
shall
sit
here
with
you
all
the
time
and
is
it
lovely
that
we
have
those
enchanting
mountains
just
before
our
eyes
i
never
saw
anything
in
my
life
that
i
liked
so
much
as
i
do
that
one
it
was
cheyenne
mountain
at
which
she
pointed
the
last
of
the
chain
and
set
a
little
apart
as
it
were
from
the
others
there
is
as
much
difference
between
mountains
as
between
people
as
know
and
like
people
they
present
characters
and
individualities
of
their
own
the
noble
lines
of
mount
cheyenne
are
full
of
a
strange
dignity
but
it
is
dignity
mixed
with
an
indefinable
charm
the
canyons
nestle
about
its
base
as
children
at
a
parent
knee
its
cedar
forests
clothe
it
like
drapery
it
lifts
its
head
to
the
dawn
and
the
sunset
and
the
sun
seems
to
love
it
best
of
all
and
lies
longer
on
it
than
on
the
other
peaks
clover
did
not
analyze
her
impressions
but
she
fell
in
love
with
it
at
first
sight
and
loved
it
better
and
better
all
the
time
that
she
stayed
at
helen
hope
and
mount
cheyenne
were
our
first
friends
in
the
place
she
used
to
say
in
how
nice
it
is
to
be
by
ourselves
said
phil
as
he
lay
comfortably
on
the
sofa
watching
clover
unpack
i
get
so
tired
of
being
all
the
time
with
people
dear
me
the
room
looks
quite
homelike
already
clover
had
spread
a
pretty
towel
over
the
bare
table
laid
some
books
and
her
upon
it
and
was
now
pinning
up
a
photograph
over
the
we
make
it
nice
she
said
cheerfully
and
now
that
tidied
up
a
little
i
think
i
go
and
see
what
has
become
of
watson
she
think
i
have
quite
forgotten
her
you
lie
quiet
and
rest
till
dinner
wo
you
yes
said
phil
who
looked
very
sleepy
i
all
right
for
an
hour
to
come
do
hurry
back
if
the
ancient
female
wants
you
clover
spread
a
shawl
over
him
before
she
went
and
shut
one
of
the
windows
illustration
clover
spread
a
shawl
over
him
before
she
left
and
shut
one
of
the
windows
we
wo
have
you
catching
cold
the
very
first
morning
she
said
that
would
be
a
bad
story
to
send
back
to
papa
she
found
watson
in
very
low
spirits
about
her
room
it
not
that
it
small
she
said
i
do
need
a
very
big
room
but
i
do
like
being
poked
away
at
the
back
so
i
always
had
a
front
room
all
my
life
and
at
ellen
in
the
summer
i
have
a
corner
chamber
and
see
the
sea
and
everything
it
an
elegant
room
solid
black
walnut
with
marble
tops
and
lighthouses
too
i
have
three
of
them
in
view
and
they
are
really
company
for
me
on
dark
nights
i
do
want
to
be
fussy
but
really
to
look
out
on
nothing
but
a
side
yard
with
some
trees
and
they
are
elms
or
anything
that
i
used
to
but
a
new
kind
there
a
thing
out
there
too
that
i
never
saw
before
which
looks
like
one
of
the
giant
ants
nests
of
africa
in
geography
that
i
used
to
read
about
when
i
was
it
makes
me
really
nervous
clover
went
to
the
window
to
look
at
the
mysterious
object
it
was
a
thing
of
white
unburned
clay
whose
use
she
could
not
guess
she
found
later
that
it
was
a
receptacle
for
ashes
i
suppose
rooms
are
front
ones
went
on
watson
querulously
mine
is
it
quite
a
little
one
at
the
side
i
think
it
must
be
just
under
this
phil
is
in
front
and
is
a
nice
large
one
with
a
view
of
the
mountains
i
wish
there
were
one
just
like
it
for
you
the
doctor
says
that
it
very
important
for
him
to
have
a
great
deal
of
air
in
his
room
doctors
always
say
that
and
of
course
hope
being
a
friend
of
yours
and
all
it
quite
natural
he
should
give
you
the
preference
though
the
phillips
are
accustomed
but
there
it
no
use
only
as
i
tell
ellen
boston
is
the
place
for
me
where
my
family
is
known
and
people
realize
what
i
used
to
i
so
sorry
clover
said
again
perhaps
somebody
will
go
away
and
marsh
have
a
front
room
for
you
before
long
she
did
say
that
she
might
i
suppose
she
thinks
some
of
her
boarders
will
be
dying
off
in
fact
there
is
one
that
tall
man
in
gray
in
the
who
did
seem
to
me
likely
to
last
long
well
we
will
hope
for
the
best
i
not
one
who
likes
to
make
difficulties
this
prospect
together
with
dinner
which
was
presently
announced
raised
watson
spirits
a
little
and
clover
left
her
in
the
parlor
exchanging
experiences
and
discussing
symptoms
with
some
ladies
who
had
sat
opposite
them
at
table
hope
came
for
a
call
a
pretty
little
woman
as
friendly
and
kind
as
her
husband
then
clover
and
phil
went
out
for
a
stroll
about
the
town
their
wonder
increased
at
every
turn
that
a
place
so
well
equipped
and
complete
in
its
appointments
could
have
been
created
out
of
nothing
in
fifteen
years
was
a
marvel
after
two
or
three
turns
they
found
themselves
among
shops
whose
windows
revealed
all
manner
of
wares
confectionery
new
books
pretty
glass
and
china
bonnets
of
the
latest
fashion
one
or
two
large
pharmacies
glittered
with
jars
purple
and
otherwise
enough
to
tempt
any
number
of
rosamonds
handsome
carriages
drawn
by
fine
horses
rolled
past
them
with
people
inside
in
short
was
exactly
like
a
thriving
eastern
town
of
double
its
size
with
the
difference
that
here
a
great
many
more
people
seemed
to
ride
than
to
drive
some
one
cantered
past
every
moment
a
lady
alone
two
or
three
girls
together
or
a
party
of
men
in
long
boots
or
a
single
ranchman
sitting
loose
in
his
stirrups
and
swinging
a
stock
whip
clover
and
phil
were
standing
on
a
corner
looking
at
some
rocky
mountain
curiosities
displayed
for
sale
minerals
pueblo
pottery
stuffed
animals
and
indian
blankets
and
phil
had
just
commented
on
the
beauty
of
a
black
horse
which
was
tied
to
a
post
close
by
when
its
rider
emerged
from
a
shop
and
prepared
to
mount
he
was
a
rather
young
fellow
sunburnt
and
not
very
tall
but
with
a
lithe
active
figure
eyes
and
a
long
mustache
of
tawny
chestnut
he
wore
spurs
and
a
sombrero
and
carried
in
his
hand
a
whip
which
seemed
lash
as
he
put
his
foot
into
the
stirrup
he
turned
for
another
look
at
clover
whom
he
had
rather
stared
at
while
passing
and
then
changing
his
intention
took
it
out
again
and
came
toward
them
i
beg
your
pardon
he
said
but
are
you
is
it
clover
carr
yes
said
clover
wondering
but
still
without
the
least
notion
as
to
whom
the
stranger
might
be
you
forgotten
me
went
on
the
young
man
with
a
smile
which
made
his
face
very
bright
that
rather
hard
too
for
i
knew
you
at
once
i
suppose
i
a
good
deal
changed
though
and
perhaps
i
should
have
made
you
out
except
for
your
eyes
they
just
the
same
why
clover
i
your
cousin
clarence
page
clarence
page
cried
clover
joyfully
not
really
why
clarence
i
never
should
have
known
you
in
the
world
and
i
ca
think
how
you
came
to
know
me
i
was
only
fourteen
when
i
saw
you
last
and
you
were
quite
a
little
boy
what
good
luck
that
we
should
meet
and
on
our
first
day
too
some
one
wrote
that
you
were
in
colorado
but
i
had
no
idea
that
you
lived
at
st
helen
i
do
not
much
i
living
on
a
ranch
out
that
way
jerking
his
elbow
toward
the
northwest
but
i
ride
in
often
to
get
the
mail
have
you
just
come
you
said
the
first
day
yes
we
only
got
here
this
morning
and
this
is
my
brother
phil
you
recollect
how
i
used
to
tell
you
about
him
at
ashburn
i
should
think
you
did
shaking
hands
cordially
she
used
to
talk
about
you
all
the
time
so
that
i
felt
intimately
acquainted
with
all
the
family
well
i
call
this
first
rate
luck
it
two
years
since
i
saw
any
one
from
home
home
well
the
east
you
know
it
all
seems
like
home
when
you
out
here
and
i
mean
any
one
that
i
know
of
course
people
from
the
east
come
out
all
the
while
they
are
as
thick
as
bumblebees
at
helen
but
they
do
amount
to
much
unless
you
know
them
have
you
seen
anything
of
mother
and
lilly
since
they
got
back
from
europe
clover
no
indeed
i
have
seen
them
since
we
left
hillsover
katy
has
though
she
met
them
in
nice
when
she
was
there
and
they
sent
her
a
wedding
present
you
knew
that
she
was
married
did
you
yes
i
got
her
cards
pa
sent
them
he
writes
oftener
than
the
others
do
and
he
came
out
once
and
stayed
a
month
on
the
ranch
with
me
that
was
while
mother
was
in
europe
where
are
you
stopping
the
shoshone
i
suppose
no
at
a
quieter
place
marsh
on
the
same
street
oh
i
know
mother
marsh
i
went
there
when
i
first
came
out
and
had
caught
the
mountain
fever
and
she
was
ever
so
kind
to
me
i
glad
you
are
there
she
a
nice
woman
how
far
away

summer
we
have
a
for
you
if
you
will
what
is
a
and
who
is
said
clover
smiling
well
a
is
a
kind
of
general
muster
of
the
stock
all
the
animals
are
driven
in
and
counted
and
the
young
ones
branded
it
pretty
exciting
sometimes
i
can
tell
you
for
the
cattle
get
wild
and
it
all
we
can
do
to
manage
them
you
should
see
some
of
our
boys
ride
splendid
and
there
one
that
the
best
hand
with
the
lasso
i
ever
saw
phil
will
like
it
i
know
and
is
me
and
my
partner
have
you
a
partner
yes
two
in
fact
but
one
of
them
lives
in
new
mexico
just
now
so
he
does
not
count
that
bert
talcott
he
a
new
york
fellow
the
english
a
devonshire
man
geoff
templestowe
is
his
name
is
he
nice
you
can
just
bet
your
pile
that
he
is
said
clarence
who
seemed
to
have
assimilated
western
slang
with
the
rest
of
the
west
wait
till
i
bring
him
to
see
you
we
come
in
on
purpose
some
day
soon
well
i
must
be
going
clover
phil
it
awfully
jolly
to
have
you
here
i
never
should
have
guessed
who
it
was
remarked
clover
as
they
watched
the
active
figure
canter
down
the
street
and
turn
for
a
last
flourish
of
the
hat
he
was
the
roughest
scrubbiest
boy
when
we
last
met
what
a
fellow
he
has
grown
to
be
and
how
well
he
rides
no
wonder
a
fellow
who
can
have
a
horse
whenever
he
has
a
mind
to
said
phil
enviously
life
on
a
ranch
must
be
great
fun
i
think
yes
in
one
way
but
pretty
rough
and
lonely
too
sometimes
it
will
be
nice
to
go
out
and
see
clarence
if
we
can
get
some
lady
to
go
with
us
wo
it
well
just
do
let
it
be
watson
whoever
else
it
is
she
would
spoil
it
all
if
she
went
now
philly
do
we
supposed
to
be
leaning
on
her
for
support
oh
come
now
lean
on
that
old
thing
why
she
could
support
a
postage
stamp
standing
edgewise
as
the
man
says
in
the
play
do
you
suppose
i
do
know
how
you
have
to
look
out
for
her
and
do
everything
she
not
a
bit
of
use
yes
but
you
and
i
have
got
to
be
polite
to
her
philly
we
forget
that
oh
i
be
polite
enough
if
she
will
just
leave
us
alone
retorted
phil
promising
chapter
vii
making
acquaintance
phil
was
better
than
his
word
he
was
never
uncivil
to
watson
and
his
distant
manners
which
really
signified
distaste
were
set
down
by
that
lady
to
boyish
shyness
they
often
are
like
that
when
they
are
young
she
told
clover
but
they
get
bravely
over
it
after
a
while
he
outgrow
it
dear
and
you
let
it
worry
you
a
bit
meanwhile
watson
own
flow
of
conversation
was
so
ample
that
there
was
never
any
danger
of
awkward
silences
when
she
was
present
which
was
a
comfort
she
had
taken
clover
into
high
favor
now
and
clover
deserved
it
for
though
she
protected
herself
against
encroachments
and
resolutely
kept
the
greater
part
of
her
time
free
for
phil
she
was
always
considerate
and
sweet
in
manner
to
the
older
lady
and
she
found
spare
every
day
in
which
to
sit
and
go
out
with
her
so
that
she
should
not
feel
neglected
watson
grew
quite
fond
of
her
young
friend
though
she
stood
a
little
in
awe
of
her
too
and
was
disposed
to
be
jealous
if
any
one
showed
more
attention
to
clover
than
to
herself
an
early
outburst
of
this
feeling
came
on
the
third
day
after
their
arrival
when
hope
asked
phil
and
clover
to
dinner
and
did
ask
watson
she
had
discussed
the
point
with
her
husband
but
the
doctor
jumped
on
the
idea
forcibly
and
protested
that
if
that
old
thing
was
to
come
too
he
would
have
a
consultation
in
pueblo
and
be
off
in
the
five
thirty
train
sure
as
fate
it
not
that
i
care
watson
assured
clover
plaintively
i
had
so
much
done
for
me
all
my
life
that
of
course
but
i
like
to
be
properly
treated
it
is
as
if
i
were
just
anybody
i
do
suppose
hope
knows
much
about
boston
society
anyway
but
still
and
i
should
think
a
girl
from
south
framingham
did
you
say
she
was
from
south
framingham
would
at
least
know
who
the
abraham
peabodys
are
and
henry
but
i
do
imagine
she
was
much
of
anybody
before
she
was
married
and
out
here
it
all
hail
fellow
and
well
met
they
say
though
in
that
case
i
do
see
well
well
it
no
matter
only
it
seems
queer
to
me
and
i
think
you
better
drop
a
hint
about
it
when
you
there
and
just
explain
that
my
daughter
lives
next
door
to
the
when
she
is
in
the
country
and
opposite
the
in
town
and
has
one
of
the
harvard
overseers
for
a
near
neighbor
and
is
distantly
related
to
the
reveres
you
think
even
a
south
framingham
girl
must
know
about
the
lantern
and
the
old
south
and
how
much
they
always
been
respected
at
home
clover
pacified
her
as
well
as
she
could
by
assurances
that
it
was
not
a
and
they
were
only
asked
to
meet
one
girl
whom
hope
wanted
her
to
know
if
it
were
a
large
affair
i
am
sure
you
would
have
been
asked
too
she
said
and
so
left
her
old
woman
of
the
sea
partly
consoled
it
was
the
most
lovely
evening
possible
as
clover
and
phil
walked
down
the
street
toward
hope
soft
shadows
lay
over
the
lower
spurs
of
the
ranges
the
canyons
looked
black
and
deep
but
the
peaks
still
glittered
in
rosy
light
the
mesa
was
in
shadow
but
the
nearer
plain
lay
in
full
sunshine
hot
and
yellow
and
the
west
wind
was
full
of
mountain
fragrance
phil
gave
little
skips
as
he
went
along
already
he
seemed
like
a
different
boy
all
the
droop
and
languor
had
gone
and
given
place
to
an
exhilaration
which
half
frightened
clover
who
had
constant
trouble
in
keeping
him
from
doing
things
which
she
knew
to
be
imprudent
hope
had
warned
her
that
invalids
often
harmed
themselves
by
under
the
first
stimulus
of
the
high
air
why
how
queer
she
exclaimed
stopping
suddenly
before
one
of
the
pretty
places
just
above
marsh
what
do
you
see
that
yard
when
we
came
by
here
yesterday
it
was
all
green
grass
and
and
girls
were
playing
croquet
and
now
look
a
pond
sure
enough
there
were
the
still
and
the
croquet
arches
but
they
were
standing
so
to
speak
up
to
their
knees
in
pools
of
water
which
seemed
several
inches
deep
and
covered
the
whole
place
with
the
exception
of
the
flagged
walks
which
ran
from
the
gates
to
the
front
and
side
doors
of
the
house
clover
noticed
now
for
the
first
time
that
these
walks
were
several
inches
higher
than
the
on
either
side
she
wondered
if
they
were
made
so
on
purpose
and
resolved
to
notice
if
the
next
place
had
the
same
arrangement
but
as
they
reached
the
next
place
and
the
next
lo
the
phenomenon
was
repeated
and
hope
lawn
too
was
in
the
same
condition
everything
was
overlaid
with
water
they
began
to
suspect
what
it
must
mean
and
hope
confirmed
the
suspicion
it
was
irrigation
day
in
mountain
avenue
it
seemed
every
street
in
the
town
had
its
appointed
period
when
the
invaluable
water
brought
from
a
long
distance
for
the
purpose
was
laid
on
and
kept
at
a
certain
depth
for
a
prescribed
number
of
hours
we
owe
our
grass
and
shrubs
and
entirely
to
this
arrangement
hope
told
them
nothing
could
live
through
our
dry
summers
if
we
did
not
have
the
irrigating
system
are
the
summers
so
dry
asked
clover
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
had
a
almost
every
day
since
we
came
we
do
have
a
good
many
thunderstorms
hope
admitted
but
we
depend
on
them
for
the
gardens
and
did
you
ever
hear
such
magnificent
thunder
asked
hope
colorado
thunder
beats
the
world
wait
till
you
see
our
magnificent
colorado
hail
put
in
hope
wickedly
that
beats
the
world
too
it
cuts
our
flowers
to
pieces
and
sometimes
kills
the
sheep
on
the
plains
we
are
very
proud
of
it
the
doctor
thinks
everything
in
colorado
perfection
i
have
always
pitied
places
which
had
to
be
irrigated
remarked
clover
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
little
which
yesterday
were
lawns
but
i
begin
to
think
i
was
mistaken
it
very
superior
of
course
to
have
rains
but
then
at
the
east
we
sometimes
do
have
rain
when
we
want
it
and
the
grass
gets
dreadfully
yellow
do
you
remember
phil
how
hard
katy
and
i
worked
last
summer
to
keep
the
geraniums
and
fuschias
alive
in
that
long
drought
now
if
we
had
had
water
like
this
to
come
once
a
week
and
make
a
nice
deep
pond
for
us
how
different
it
would
have
been
oh
you
must
come
out
west
for
real
comfort
said
hope
the
east
is
a
dreadfully
little
place
anyhow
but
you
do
mean
new
york
and
boston
when
you
say
little
place
surely
do
i
said
the
undaunted
doctor
wait
till
you
see
more
of
us
out
here
here
poppy
at
last
cried
hope
as
a
girl
came
hurriedly
up
the
walk
you
late
dear
poppy
whose
real
name
was
marian
chase
was
the
girl
who
had
been
asked
to
meet
them
she
was
a
tall
rosy
creature
to
whom
clover
took
an
instant
fancy
and
seemed
in
perfect
health
yet
she
told
them
that
when
she
came
out
to
colorado
three
years
before
she
had
travelled
on
a
mattress
with
a
doctor
and
a
trained
nurse
in
attendance
your
brother
will
be
as
strong
or
stronger
than
i
at
the
end
of
a
year
she
said
or
if
he
does
get
well
as
fast
as
he
ought
you
must
take
him
up
to
the
ute
valley
that
where
i
made
my
first
gain
where
is
the
valley
thirty
miles
away
to
the
northwest
up
there
among
the
mountains
it
is
a
great
deal
higher
than
this
and
such
a
lovely
peaceful
place
i
hope
you
go
there
we
shall
of
course
if
phil
needs
it
but
i
like
helen
so
much
that
i
would
rather
stay
here
if
we
can
dinner
was
now
announced
and
hope
led
the
way
into
a
pretty
room
hung
with
engravings
and
old
plates
after
the
modern
fashion
where
a
table
stood
decorated
with
with
little
tapers
and
a
pyramid
of
plums
and
apricots
there
was
the
usual
succession
of
soup
and
fish
and
roast
and
salad
which
one
looks
for
at
a
dinner
on
the
winding
up
with
of
a
highly
civilized
description
but
clover
could
scarcely
eat
for
wondering
how
all
these
things
had
come
there
so
soon
so
very
soon
it
seemed
like
magic
one
minute
the
solemn
peaks
and
passes
the
and
the
thorny
plain
the
next
all
these
portières
and
rugs
and
etchings
and
down
pillows
and
pretty
devices
in
glass
and
china
as
if
some
enchanter
wand
had
tapped
the
wilderness
and
hey
presto
modern
civilization
had
sprung
up
like
jonah
gourd
all
in
a
minute
or
like
the
palace
which
aladdin
summoned
into
being
in
a
single
night
for
the
occupation
of
the
princess
of
china
by
the
rubbing
of
his
wonderful
lamp
and
then
just
as
the
were
put
on
the
table
came
a
call
and
the
doctor
was
out
in
the
hall
holloing
and
conducting
with
some
distant
patient
one
of
those
mysterious
telephonic
conversations
which
to
those
who
overhear
seem
all
replies
and
no
questions
it
was
most
remarkable
and
quite
unlike
her
preconceived
ideas
of
what
was
likely
to
take
place
at
the
base
of
the
rocky
mountains
a
pleasant
evening
followed
poppy
played
delightfully
on
the
piano
later
came
a
rubber
of
whist
it
was
like
home
before
these
children
go
let
us
settle
about
the
drive
said
hope
to
his
wife
oh
yes
miss
carr
oh
please
wo
you
call
me
clover
indeed
i
will
clover
then
we
want
to
take
you
for
a
good
long
drive
and
show
you
something
but
the
trouble
is
the
doctor
and
i
are
at
variance
as
to
what
the
something
shall
be
i
want
you
to
see
odin
garden
and
the
doctor
insists
that
you
ought
to
go
to
the
cheyenne
canyons
first
because
those
are
his
favorites
now
which
shall
it
be
we
will
leave
it
to
you
but
how
can
i
choose
i
do
know
either
of
them
what
a
queer
name
odin
garden
i
tell
you
how
to
settle
it
cried
marian
chase
whose
nickname
it
seemed
had
been
given
her
because
when
she
first
came
to
helen
she
wore
a
bunch
of
poppies
in
her
hat
take
them
to
cheyenne
and
the
next
day
or
thursday
let
me
get
up
a
picnic
for
odin
garden
just
a
few
of
our
special
cronies
the
allans
and
the
blanchards
and
mary
pelham
and
will
amory
will
you
dear
hope
and
be
our
matron
that
would
be
lovely
hope
consented
and
clover
walked
home
as
if
treading
on
air
was
this
the
helen
to
which
she
had
looked
forward
with
so
much
dread
this
gay
delightful
place
where
such
pleasant
things
happened
and
people
were
so
kind
how
she
wished
that
she
could
get
at
katy
and
papa
for
five
minutes
on
a
wishing
carpet
or
something
to
tell
them
how
different
everything
was
from
what
she
had
expected
one
thing
only
marred
her
anticipations
for
the
morrow
which
was
the
fear
that
watson
might
be
hurt
and
make
a
scene
happily
thoughts
took
the
same
direction
and
by
some
occult
process
of
influence
the
use
of
which
good
wives
understand
she
prevailed
on
her
refractory
doctor
to
allow
the
old
lady
to
be
asked
to
join
the
party
so
early
next
morning
came
a
very
polite
note
and
it
was
proposed
that
phil
should
ride
the
doctor
horse
and
act
as
escort
to
miss
chase
who
was
to
go
on
horseback
likewise
no
proposal
could
have
been
more
agreeable
to
phil
who
adored
horses
and
seldom
had
the
chance
to
mount
one
so
every
one
was
pleased
and
watson
preened
her
ancestral
feathers
with
great
satisfaction
you
see
dear
how
well
it
was
to
give
that
little
hint
about
the
reveres
and
the
abraham
peabodys
she
said
clover
felt
dreadfully
dishonest
but
she
dared
not
confess
that
she
had
forgotten
all
about
the
hint
still
less
that
she
had
never
meant
to
give
one
the
better
part
of
valor
is
discretion
she
remembered
so
she
held
her
peace
though
her
cheeks
glowed
guiltily
at
three
they
set
forth
in
a
light
roomy
carriage
not
exactly
a
carryall
but
of
the
carryall
family
with
a
pair
of
fast
horses
miss
chase
and
phil
cantering
happily
alongside
or
before
or
behind
just
as
it
happened
the
sun
was
very
hot
but
there
was
a
delicious
breeze
and
the
dryness
and
elasticity
of
the
air
made
the
heat
easy
to
bear
the
way
lay
across
and
down
the
southern
slope
of
the
plateau
on
which
the
town
was
built
then
they
came
to
splendid
fields
of
grain
and
afalfa
a
cereal
quite
new
to
them
with
broad
very
green
leaves
the
roadside
was
gay
with
flowers
gillias
and
mountain
balm
high
pink
and
purple
spikes
like
foxgloves
which
they
were
told
were
pentstemons
painters
brush
whose
green
tips
seemed
dipped
in
liquid
vermilion
and
masses
of
the
splendid
wild
poppies
they
crossed
a
foaming
little
river
and
a
sharp
turn
brought
them
into
a
narrower
and
wilder
road
which
ran
straight
toward
the
mountain
side
this
was
overhung
by
trees
whose
shade
was
grateful
after
the
hot
sun
narrower
and
narrower
grew
the
road
more
and
more
sharp
the
turns
they
were
at
the
entrance
of
a
deep
defile
up
which
the
road
wound
and
wound
following
the
links
of
the
river
which
they
crossed
and
recrossed
repeatedly
such
a
wonderful
and
perfect
little
river
with
water
clear
as
air
and
cold
as
ice
flowing
over
a
bed
of
smooth
granite
here
slipping
noiselessly
down
long
slopes
of
rock
like
thin
films
of
glass
there
deepening
into
pools
of
translucent
like
or
beryl
again
plunging
down
in
mimic
waterfalls
a
sheet
of
iridescent
foam
the
sound
of
its
rush
and
its
ripple
was
like
a
laugh
never
was
such
happy
water
clover
thought
as
it
curved
and
bent
and
swayed
this
way
and
that
on
its
downward
course
as
if
moved
by
some
merry
capricious
instinct
like
a
child
dancing
as
it
goes
regiments
or
great
ferns
grew
along
its
banks
and
immense
thickets
of
wild
roses
of
all
shades
from
deep
jacqueminot
red
to
pale
here
and
there
rose
a
lonely
spike
of
yucca
and
in
the
little
ravines
to
right
and
left
grew
in
the
crevices
of
the
rocks
clumps
of
superb
columbines
four
feet
high
looking
up
clover
saw
above
the
strange
pinnacles
and
spires
and
obelisks
which
seemed
of
and
and
pale
pinkish
gray
and
terra
cotta
in
which
the
sunshine
and
the
broke
in
a
multiplicity
of
wonderful
above
them
was
the
dazzling
blue
of
the
colorado
sky
she
drew
a
long
long
breath
so
this
is
a
canyon
she
said
how
glad
i
am
that
i
have
lived
to
see
one
yes
this
is
a
canyon
hope
replied
some
of
us
think
it
canyon
but
there
are
dozens
of
others
and
no
two
of
them
are
alike
glad
you
are
pleased
with
this
for
it
my
favorite
i
wish
your
father
could
see
it
clover
hardly
understood
what
he
said
she
was
so
fascinated
and
absorbed
she
looked
up
at
the
bright
pinnacles
down
at
the
flowers
and
the
sheen
of
the
and
the
mad
rush
of
its
cascades
and
felt
as
though
she
were
in
a
dream
through
the
dream
she
caught
fragments
of
conversation
from
the
seat
behind
watson
was
giving
her
impressions
of
the
scenery
it
pretty
i
suppose
she
remarked
but
it
so
very
queer
and
not
used
to
queer
things
and
this
road
is
frightfully
narrow
if
a
load
of
hay
or
a
big
concord
coach
should
come
along
i
ca
think
what
we
should
do
i
see
that
hope
drives
carefully
but
yet
you
do
think
we
shall
meet
anything
of
the
kind
do
you
doctor
not
a
concord
coach
and
certainly
not
a
for
they
do
make
hay
up
here
in
the
mountains
well
that
is
a
relief
i
did
know
ellen
she
always
says
you
a
real
fidget
but
when
one
grows
old
and
has
valves
in
the
heart
as
i
have
you
never
we
might
meet
one
of
those
big
pedler
wagons
though
and
they
frighten
horses
worse
than
anything
oh
what
that
coming
now
let
us
get
out
hope
pray
let
us
all
get
out
sit
still
said
the
doctor
sternly
for
watson
was
wildly
fumbling
at
the
fastening
of
the
door
mary
put
your
arm
round
watson
and
hold
her
tight
there
be
a
real
accident
sure
as
fate
if
you
do
then
in
a
gentler
tone
it
only
a
buggy
plenty
of
room
there
no
possible
risk
of
a
pedler
wagon
what
on
earth
should
a
pedler
be
doing
up
here
on
the
side
of
cheyenne
do
use
pomatum
or
oh
i
did
know
repeated
poor
watson
nervously
she
watched
the
buggy
timorously
till
it
was
safely
past
then
her
spirits
revived
well
she
cried
we
safe
this
time
but
i
call
it
tempting
providence
to
drive
so
fast
on
such
a
rough
road
if
all
canyons
are
as
wild
as
this
i
ever
venture
to
go
into
another
bless
me
this
is
one
of
our
mildest
specimens
said
hope
who
seemed
to
have
a
perverse
desire
to
give
watson
a
distaste
for
canyons
this
is
a
smooth
one
but
some
canyons
are
really
rough
do
you
remember
mary
the
day
we
got
stuck
up
at
the
top
of
the
westmoreland
and
had
to
unhitch
the
horses
and
how
i
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
creek
and
yanked
the
carriage
round
while
you
held
them
that
was
the
day
we
heard
the
mountain
lion
and
there
were
fresh
all
over
the
mud
you
remember
good
gracious
cried
watson
quite
pale
what
an
awful
place
bears
and
lions
what
on
earth
did
you
go
there
for
oh
purely
for
pleasure
replied
the
doctor
lightly
we
do
mind
such
little
matters
out
west
we
try
to
accustom
ourselves
to
wild
beasts
and
make
friends
of
them
john
do
talk
such
nonsense
cried
his
wife
quite
angrily
watson
you
must
believe
a
word
the
doctor
says
i
lived
in
colorado
nine
years
and
i
never
once
seen
a
mountain
lion
or
a
bear
either
except
the
stuffed
ones
in
the
shops
do
let
the
doctor
frighten
you
but
hope
wicked
work
was
done
watson
quite
unconvinced
by
these
assurances
sat
pale
and
repeating
under
her
breath
dreadful
what
ellen
say
bears
and
lions
oh
dear
me
look
look
cried
clover
who
had
not
listened
to
a
word
of
this
conversation
did
you
ever
see
anything
so
lovely
she
referred
to
what
she
was
looking
at
a
small
point
of
pale
rock
some
hundreds
of
feet
in
height
which
a
turn
in
the
road
had
just
revealed
soaring
above
the
tops
of
the
trees
i
do
see
that
it
lovely
at
all
said
watson
testily
unnatural
if
that
what
you
mean
rocks
ought
not
to
be
that
color
they
never
are
at
the
east
it
looks
to
me
exactly
like
an
enormous
unripe
banana
standing
on
end
this
simile
nearly
finished
the
party
it
big
enough
to
disagree
with
all
the
in
creation
at
once
remarked
the
doctor
between
his
shouts
while
even
clover
shook
with
laughter
watson
felt
that
she
had
made
a
hit
and
grew
complacent
again
see
what
your
brother
picked
for
me
cried
poppy
riding
alongside
and
exhibiting
a
great
sheaf
of
columbine
tied
to
the
pommel
of
her
saddle
and
how
do
you
like
north
cheyenne
is
it
an
exquisite
place
perfectly
lovely
i
feel
as
if
i
must
come
here
every
day
yes
i
know
but
there
are
so
many
other
places
out
here
about
which
you
have
that
feeling
now
we
will
show
you
the
other
cheyenne
canyon
the
twin
of
this
said
hope
but
you
must
prepare
your
mind
to
find
it
entirely
different
after
rather
a
rough
mile
or
two
through
woods
they
came
to
a
wooden
shed
or
shanty
at
the
mouth
of
a
gorge
and
here
hope
drew
up
his
horses
and
helped
them
all
out
is
it
much
of
a
walk
asked
watson
it
is
rather
long
and
rather
steep
said
hope
but
it
is
lovely
if
you
only
go
a
little
way
in
and
you
and
i
will
sit
down
the
moment
you
feel
tired
and
let
the
others
go
forward
south
cheyenne
canyon
was
indeed
entirely
different
instead
of
a
ravine
it
is
a
wild
mountain
gorge
walled
with
precipitous
cliffs
of
great
height
and
its
river
every
canyon
has
a
river
comes
from
a
source
at
the
top
of
the
gorge
in
a
series
of
mad
leaps
forming
seven
waterfalls
which
plunge
into
circular
basins
of
rock
worn
smooth
by
the
action
of
the
stream
these
pools
are
curiously
various
in
shape
and
the
color
of
the
water
as
it
pauses
a
moment
to
rest
in
each
before
taking
its
next
plunge
is
beautiful
little
plank
walks
are
laid
along
the
and
rude
staircases
for
the
steepest
pitches
up
these
the
party
went
leaving
watson
and
hope
far
behind
poppy
with
her
habit
over
her
arm
clover
stopping
every
other
moment
to
pick
some
new
flower
phil
shying
stones
into
the
rapids
as
he
passed
till
the
top
of
the
topmost
cascade
was
reached
and
looking
back
they
could
see
the
whole
wonderful
way
by
which
they
had
climbed
and
down
which
the
river
made
its
turbulent
rush
clover
gathered
a
great
mat
of
green
vine
like
glorified
cranberry
which
hope
told
her
was
the
famous
kinnikinnick
and
was
just
remarking
on
the
cool
which
filled
the
place
when
all
of
a
sudden
these
sounds
seemed
to
grow
angry
the
defile
of
precipices
turned
a
frowning
blue
and
looking
up
they
saw
a
great
gathering
overhead
we
must
run
cried
hope
and
down
they
flew
racing
at
full
speed
along
the
long
flights
of
steps
and
the
plank
walks
which
echoed
to
the
sound
of
their
flying
feet
far
below
they
could
see
two
specks
which
they
guessed
to
be
hope
and
watson
hurrying
to
a
place
of
shelter
nearer
and
nearer
came
the
storm
louder
the
growl
of
the
thunder
and
great
pattered
on
their
heads
before
they
gained
the
cabin
none
too
soon
for
in
another
moment
the
cloud
broke
and
the
air
was
full
of
a
dizzy
whirl
of
sleet
and
rain
others
besides
themselves
had
been
surprised
in
the
ravine
and
every
few
minutes
another
and
another
wet
figure
would
come
flying
down
the
path
so
that
the
little
refuge
was
soon
full
the
storm
lasted
half
an
hour
then
it
scattered
as
rapidly
as
it
had
come
the
sun
broke
out
brilliantly
and
the
drive
home
would
have
been
delightful
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
sad
fact
that
watson
had
left
her
parasol
in
the
carriage
and
it
had
been
wet
and
somewhat
stained
by
the
blanket
which
had
been
thrown
over
it
for
protection
her
lamentations
were
pathetic
jane
phillips
gave
it
to
me
she
was
a
sampson
you
know
and
i
thought
ever
so
much
of
it
it
was
at
hovey
we
were
there
together
and
i
admired
it
and
she
said
watson
you
must
let
me
six
dollars
was
the
price
of
it
that
a
good
deal
for
a
parasol
you
know
unless
it
really
a
nice
one
but
hovey
things
are
always
i
had
the
handle
shortened
a
little
just
before
i
came
away
too
so
that
it
would
go
into
my
trunk
it
had
to
be
mended
anyhow
so
that
it
seemed
a
good
dear
dear
and
now
it
spoiled
what
a
pity
i
left
it
in
the
carriage
i
shall
know
better
another
time
but
this
climate
is
so
different
it
never
rains
in
this
way
at
home
it
takes
a
little
while
about
it
and
gives
notice
and
we
say
that
there
going
to
be
a
northeaster
or
that
it
looks
like
a
and
we
put
on
our
clothes
or
we
stay
at
home
it
a
great
deal
nicer
i
think
i
am
so
sorry
said
kind
little
hope
our
storms
out
here
do
come
up
very
suddenly
i
wish
i
had
noticed
that
you
had
left
your
parasol
well
clover
you
had
a
chance
now
to
see
the
doctor
beautiful
colorado
hail
and
thunder
to
perfection
how
do
you
like
them
i
like
everything
in
colorado
i
believe
replied
clover
laughing
i
wo
even
except
the
hail
she
the
girl
for
this
part
of
the
world
cried
hope
approvingly
she
make
a
pioneer
we
keep
her
out
here
mary
and
never
let
her
go
home
she
was
born
to
live
at
the
west
was
i
it
seems
queer
then
that
i
should
have
been
born
to
live
in
burnet
oh
we
change
all
that
i
sure
i
do
see
how
there
are
ways
and
means
oracularly
watson
was
so
cast
down
by
the
misadventure
to
her
parasol
that
she
expressed
no
regret
at
not
being
asked
to
join
in
the
picnic
next
day
especially
as
she
understood
that
it
consisted
of
young
people
hope
very
rightly
decided
that
a
whole
day
out
of
doors
in
a
rough
place
would
give
pain
rather
than
pleasure
to
a
person
who
was
both
so
feeble
and
so
fussy
and
did
not
suggest
her
going
clover
and
phil
waked
up
quite
fresh
and
untired
after
a
sound
night
sleep
there
seemed
no
limit
to
what
might
be
done
and
enjoyed
in
that
inexhaustibly
renovating
air
odin
garden
proved
to
be
a
wonderful
assemblage
of
rocky
shapes
rising
from
the
grass
and
flowers
of
a
lonely
little
plain
on
the
far
side
of
the
mesa
four
or
five
miles
from
helen
the
name
of
the
place
came
probably
from
something
suggestive
in
the
forms
of
the
rocks
which
reminded
clover
of
pictures
she
had
seen
of
assyrian
and
egyptian
rock
carvings
there
were
lion
shapes
and
bull
shapes
like
the
rudely
chiselled
gods
of
some
heathen
worship
there
were
slender
points
and
obelisks
three
hundred
feet
high
and
something
suggesting
a
deity
and
queer
similitudes
of
crocodiles
and
apes
all
in
the
strange
orange
and
red
and
pale
yellow
formations
of
the
region
it
was
a
wonderful
rather
than
a
beautiful
place
but
the
day
was
spent
very
happily
under
those
mysterious
stones
which
as
the
long
afternoon
shadows
gathered
over
the
plain
and
the
sky
glowed
with
sunset
crimson
which
seemed
like
a
reflection
from
the
rocks
themselves
became
more
mysterious
still
of
the
merry
young
party
which
made
up
the
picnic
seven
out
of
nine
had
come
to
colorado
for
health
but
no
one
would
have
guessed
it
they
seemed
so
well
and
so
full
of
the
enjoyment
of
life
altogether
it
was
a
day
to
be
marked
not
with
a
white
stone
that
would
not
have
seemed
appropriate
to
colorado
but
with
a
red
one
clover
writing
about
it
afterward
to
elsie
felt
that
her
descriptions
to
sober
might
easily
sound
overdrawn
and
exaggerated
and
wound
up
her
letter
thus
perhaps
you
think
that
i
am
romancing
but
i
am
not
a
bit
every
word
i
say
is
perfectly
true
only
i
have
not
made
the
colors
half
bright
or
the
things
half
beautiful
enough
colorado
is
the
most
beautiful
place
in
the
world
clover
had
seen
but
a
limited
portion
of
the
world
so
far
i
only
wish
you
could
all
come
out
to
observe
for
yourselves
that
i
am
not
fibbing
though
it
sounds
like
it
chapter
viii
high
valley
clover
was
putting
phil
chamber
to
rights
and
turning
it
into
a
for
the
day
which
was
always
her
first
task
in
the
morning
they
had
been
at
helen
nearly
three
weeks
now
and
the
place
had
taken
on
a
very
homelike
appearance
all
the
books
and
the
photographs
were
unpacked
the
washstand
had
vanished
behind
a
screen
made
of
a
draped
with
chintz
while
a
ruffled
cover
of
the
same
gay
chintz
on
which
bunches
of
crimson
and
pink
geraniums
straggled
over
a
ground
gave
to
the
narrow
bed
the
air
of
a
respectable
wide
sofa
there
those
look
very
nice
i
think
she
said
giving
the
last
touch
to
a
bowl
full
of
beautiful
garden
roses
how
sweet
they
are
your
young
man
seems
rather
clever
about
roses
remarked
phil
who
dearly
loved
to
tease
his
sister
my
young
man
as
you
call
him
has
a
father
with
a
gardener
replied
clover
calmly
no
very
brilliant
cleverness
is
required
for
that
in
a
cordial
kindly
place
like
helen
people
soon
make
acquaintances
and
clover
and
phil
felt
as
if
they
already
knew
half
the
people
in
the
town
every
one
had
come
to
see
them
and
deluged
them
with
flowers
and
invitations
to
dine
to
drive
to
take
tea
among
the
rest
came
thurber
wade
whom
phil
was
pleased
to
call
clover
young
man
the
son
of
a
rich
new
york
banker
whose
had
brought
him
to
live
in
helen
and
who
had
built
a
handsome
house
on
the
principal
street
this
gilded
youth
had
several
times
sent
roses
to
clover
a
fact
which
phil
had
noticed
and
upon
which
he
was
fond
of
commenting
speaking
of
young
men
went
on
clover
what
do
you
suppose
has
become
of
clarence
page
he
said
he
should
come
in
to
see
us
soon
but
that
was
ever
so
long
ago
he
a
fraud
i
suspect
replied
phil
lazily
from
his
seat
in
the
window
he
had
a
geometry
on
his
knees
and
was
supposed
to
be
going
on
with
his
education
but
in
reality
he
was
looking
at
the
mountains
i
suppose
people
are
pretty
busy
on
ranches
though
he
added
perhaps
they
oh
it
is
a
sheep
ranch
do
you
remember
his
saying
that
the
cattle
got
very
wild
and
they
had
to
ride
after
them
they
would
ride
after
sheep
i
hope
he
has
forgotten
about
us
i
was
so
glad
to
see
him
while
this
talk
went
on
clarence
was
cantering
down
the
lower
end
of
the
ute
pass
on
his
way
to
helen
three
hours
later
his
name
was
brought
up
to
them
how
nice
cried
clover
i
think
as
he
a
relative
we
might
let
him
come
here
phil
it
so
much
pleasanter
than
the
parlor
clarence
who
had
passed
the
interval
of
waiting
in
noting
the
different
varieties
of
cough
among
the
sick
people
in
the
parlor
was
quite
of
her
opinion
how
jolly
you
look
was
almost
his
first
remark
i
glad
you
got
a
little
place
of
your
own
and
do
have
to
sit
with
those
poor
creatures
downstairs
all
the
time
it
is
much
nicer
some
of
them
are
getting
better
though
some
of
them
are
there
one
poor
fellow
in
a
who
looks
badly
that
the
one
whose
room
watson
has
marked
for
her
own
she
asks
him
three
times
a
day
how
he
feels
with
all
the
solicitude
of
a
mother
said
phil
who
mrs
watson
well
she
an
old
lady
who
is
somehow
fastened
to
us
and
who
considers
herself
our
chaperone
replied
clover
with
a
little
laugh
i
must
introduce
you
but
first
we
want
a
good
talk
all
by
ourselves
now
tell
us
why
you
have
come
to
see
us
before
we
have
been
hoping
for
you
every
day
well
i
wanted
to
come
badly
enough
but
there
has
been
a
combination
of
hindrances
two
of
our
men
got
sick
so
there
was
more
to
do
than
usual
then
geoff
had
to
be
away
four
days
and
almost
as
soon
as
he
got
back
he
had
bad
news
from
home
and
i
hated
to
leave
him
alone
what
sort
of
bad
news
his
sister
dead
poor
fellow
in
england
too
you
said
he
was
english
did
you
yes
she
was
married
her
husband
was
a
clergyman
down
in
cornwall
somewhere
she
was
older
than
geoff
a
good
deal
but
he
was
very
fond
of
her
and
the
news
cut
him
up
dreadfully
no
wonder
it
is
horrible
to
hear
such
a
thing
when
one
is
far
from
home
observed
clover
she
tried
to
realize
how
she
should
feel
if
word
came
to
helen
of
katy
death
or
elsie
or
johnnie
but
her
mind
refused
to
accept
the
question
the
very
idea
made
her
shiver
poor
fellow
she
said
again
what
could
you
do
for
him
clarence
not
much
i
a
poor
hand
at
comforting
any
one
men
generally
are
i
guess
geoff
knows
i
sorry
for
him
but
it
takes
a
woman
to
say
the
right
thing
at
such
times
we
sit
and
smoke
when
the
work
done
and
i
know
what
he
thinking
about
but
we
do
say
anything
to
each
other
now
let
speak
of
something
else
i
want
to
settle
about
your
coming
to
high
valley
high
valley
is
that
the
name
of
your
place
yes
i
want
you
to
see
it
it
an
awfully
pretty
place
to
my
thinking
not
so
very
much
higher
than
this
but
you
have
to
climb
a
good
deal
to
get
there
ca
you
come
this
is
just
the
time
raspberries
ripe
and
lots
of
flowers
wherever
the
beasts
do
get
at
them
phil
can
have
all
the
riding
he
wants
and
it
do
poor
geoff
lots
of
good
to
see
some
one
it
would
be
very
nice
indeed
doubtfully
but
who
could
we
get
to
go
with
us
i
thought
of
that
we
do
take
much
stock
in
grundy
out
here
but
i
supposed
you
want
another
lady
how
would
it
be
if
i
asked
hope
the
doctor
got
to
come
out
anyway
to
see
one
of
our
herders
who
put
his
shoulder
out
in
a
fall
if
he
would
drive
you
out
and
hope
would
stay
on
would
you
come
for
a
week
i
guess
you
like
it
i
we
should
exclaimed
clover
her
face
lighting
up
clarence
how
delightful
it
sounds
it
will
be
lovely
to
come
if
hope
says
yes
then
that
all
right
replied
clarence
looking
extremely
pleased
i
ride
up
to
the
doctor
as
soon
as
dinner
over
you
dine
with
us
of
course
oh
i
always
come
to
mother
marsh
for
a
bite
whenever
i
stay
over
the
day
she
likes
to
have
me
we
been
great
chums
ever
since
i
had
fever
here
and
she
took
care
of
me
clover
was
amused
at
dinner
to
watch
the
cool
deliberation
with
which
clarence
studied
watson
and
her
tortuous
conversation
and
as
he
would
have
expressed
it
took
stock
of
her
the
result
was
not
favorable
apparently
what
on
earth
did
they
send
that
old
thing
with
you
for
he
asked
as
soon
as
they
went
upstairs
she
as
much
out
of
her
element
here
as
a
would
be
in
a
cyclone
she
ca
be
any
use
to
you
clover
well
no
i
do
think
she
is
it
was
a
sort
of
mistake
i
tell
you
about
it
sometime
but
she
likes
to
imagine
that
she
taking
care
of
me
and
as
it
does
no
harm
i
let
her
taking
care
of
you
great
thunder
i
would
trust
her
to
take
care
of
a
kitten
observed
the
irreverent
clarence
well
i
ride
up
and
settle
with
the
hopes
and
stop
and
let
you
know
as
i
come
back
hope
and
the
doctor
were
not
hard
to
persuade
in
colorado
people
keep
their
lamps
of
enjoyment
filled
and
trimmed
so
to
speak
and
their
travelling
energies
ready
girt
about
them
and
easily
adopt
any
plan
which
promises
pleasure
the
following
day
was
fixed
for
the
start
and
clover
packed
her
valise
and
phil
bag
with
a
sense
of
exhilaration
and
escape
she
was
in
truth
getting
very
tired
of
the
exactions
of
watson
watson
on
her
part
did
not
at
all
approve
of
the
excursion
i
think
she
said
swelling
with
offended
dignity
that
your
cousin
did
know
much
about
politeness
when
he
left
me
out
of
his
invitation
and
asked
hope
instead
yes
i
know
the
doctor
had
to
go
up
anyway
that
may
be
true
and
it
may
not
but
it
does
alter
the
case
what
am
i
to
do
i
should
like
to
know
if
the
valves
of
my
heart
do
open
or
do
shut
whichever
it
is
while
i
left
all
alone
here
among
strangers
send
for
hope
suggested
phil
he
only
be
gone
one
night
clover
does
know
anything
about
valves
my
cousin
lives
in
a
rather
rough
way
i
imagine
interposed
clover
with
a
reproving
look
at
phil
he
would
hardly
like
to
ask
a
stranger
and
an
invalid
to
his
house
when
he
might
not
be
able
to
make
her
comfortable
hope
has
been
there
before
and
she
an
old
friend
oh
i
dare
say
there
are
always
reasons
i
do
say
that
i
should
have
felt
like
going
but
he
ought
to
have
asked
me
ellen
will
be
surprised
and
so
will
he
from
ashburn
too
and
he
must
know
the
parmenters
and
parmenter
brother
son
is
partner
to
henry
of
no
consequence
of
course
still
respect
older
people
boston
not
used
to
phillips
watson
voice
died
away
into
fragmentary
and
inaudible
lamentings
clover
attempted
no
further
excuse
her
good
sense
told
her
that
she
had
a
perfect
right
to
accept
this
little
pleasure
that
watson
plans
for
western
travel
had
been
formed
quite
independently
of
their
own
and
that
papa
would
not
wish
her
to
sacrifice
herself
and
phil
to
such
unreasonable
humors
still
it
was
not
pleasant
and
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
from
this
time
dated
a
change
of
feeling
on
watson
part
toward
her
young
friends
she
took
up
a
chronic
position
of
grievance
toward
them
confided
her
wrongs
to
all
and
met
clover
with
an
offended
air
which
though
clover
ignored
it
did
not
add
to
the
happiness
of
her
life
at
marsh
it
was
early
in
the
afternoon
when
they
started
and
the
sun
was
just
dipping
behind
the
mountain
wall
when
they
drove
into
the
high
valley
it
was
one
of
those
natural
parks
four
miles
long
which
lie
like
gardens
among
the
colorado
ranges
the
richest
of
grass
clothed
it
fine
trees
grew
in
clumps
and
clusters
here
and
there
and
the
spaces
about
the
house
where
fences
of
barbed
wire
defended
the
grass
from
the
cattle
seemed
a
carpet
of
clover
exclaimed
with
delight
at
the
view
the
ranges
which
lapped
and
held
the
high
sheltered
upland
in
embrace
opened
toward
the
south
and
revealed
a
splendid
lonely
peak
on
whose
summit
a
drift
of
snow
was
lying
the
contrast
with
the
verdure
and
bloom
below
was
charming
the
cabin
it
was
little
more
stood
facing
this
view
and
was
backed
by
a
group
of
noble
red
cedars
it
was
built
of
logs
long
and
low
with
a
rude
porch
in
front
supported
on
unbarked
tree
trunks
two
fine
collies
rushed
to
meet
them
barking
vociferously
and
at
the
sound
clarence
hurried
to
the
door
he
met
them
with
great
enthusiasm
lifted
out
hope
then
clover
and
then
began
shouting
for
his
chum
who
was
inside
hollo
geoff
where
are
you
hurry
up
they
come
then
as
he
appeared
ladies
and
gentleman
my
partner
geoffrey
templestowe
was
a
tall
sinewy
young
englishman
with
ruddy
hair
and
beard
grave
blue
eyes
and
an
unmistakable
air
of
good
breeding
he
wore
a
blue
flannel
shirt
and
high
boots
like
clarence
yet
somehow
he
made
clarence
look
a
little
rough
and
undistinguished
he
was
quiet
in
speech
reserved
in
manner
and
seemed
depressed
and
under
a
cloud
but
clover
liked
his
face
at
once
he
looked
both
strong
and
kind
she
thought
the
house
consisted
of
one
large
square
room
in
the
middle
which
served
as
parlor
and
both
and
on
either
side
two
bedrooms
the
kitchen
was
in
a
separate
building
there
was
no
lack
of
comfort
though
things
were
rather
rude
and
the
place
had
a
bare
masculine
look
the
floor
was
strewn
with
coyote
and
fox
skins
two
or
three
stood
around
the
fireplace
in
which
july
as
it
was
a
big
log
was
blazing
their
covers
were
shabby
and
worn
but
they
looked
comfortable
and
were
evidently
in
constant
use
there
was
not
the
least
attempt
at
prettiness
anywhere
pipes
and
books
and
old
newspapers
littered
the
chairs
and
tables
when
an
extra
seat
was
needed
clarence
simply
tipped
a
great
pile
of
these
on
to
the
floor
a
hung
upon
the
wall
together
with
sundry
long
and
two
or
three
pairs
of
spurs
and
a
smell
of
tobacco
pervaded
the
place
clover
eyes
wandered
to
a
corner
where
stood
a
small
parlor
organ
and
over
it
a
shelf
of
books
she
rose
to
examine
them
to
her
surprise
they
were
all
hymnals
and
church
of
england
there
were
no
others
she
wondered
what
it
meant
clarence
had
given
up
his
own
bedroom
to
phil
and
was
to
chum
with
his
friend
some
little
attempt
had
been
made
to
adorn
the
rooms
which
were
meant
for
the
ladies
clean
towels
had
been
spread
over
the
pine
shelves
which
did
duty
for
and
on
each
stood
a
tumbler
stuffed
as
full
as
it
could
hold
with
purple
pentstemons
clover
could
not
help
laughing
yet
there
was
something
pathetic
to
her
in
the
clumsy
arrangement
she
relieved
the
tumbler
by
putting
a
few
of
the
flowers
in
her
dress
and
went
out
again
to
the
parlor
where
hope
sat
by
the
fire
quizzing
the
two
partners
who
were
hard
at
work
setting
their
it
was
rather
a
droll
spectacle
the
two
muscular
young
fellows
creaking
to
and
fro
in
their
heavy
boots
and
taking
such
an
infinitude
of
pains
with
their
operations
one
would
set
a
plate
on
the
table
and
the
other
would
forthwith
alter
its
position
slightly
or
lift
and
scrutinize
a
tumbler
and
dust
it
sedulously
with
a
each
spoon
was
polished
with
the
greatest
particularity
before
it
was
laid
on
the
tray
each
knife
passed
under
inspection
visitors
were
not
an
luxury
in
the
high
valley
and
too
much
care
could
not
be
taken
for
their
entertainment
it
seemed
supper
was
brought
in
by
a
chinese
cook
in
a
pigtail
wooden
shoes
and
a
blue
mother
hubbard
choo
loo
by
name
he
was
evidently
a
good
cook
for
the
and
fresh
mountain
trout
and
the
ham
and
eggs
were
savory
to
the
last
degree
and
the
flapjacks
with
which
the
meal
concluded
and
which
were
eaten
with
a
sauce
of
melted
raspberry
jelly
deserved
even
higher
encomium
we
are
willing
to
be
treated
as
company
this
first
night
observed
hope
but
if
you
are
going
to
keep
us
a
week
you
must
let
us
make
ourselves
useful
and
set
the
table
and
arrange
the
rooms
for
you
we
will
begin
morning
added
clover
may
we
clarence
may
we
play
that
it
is
our
house
and
do
what
we
like
and
change
about
and
arrange
things
it
will
be
such
fun
fire
away
said
her
cousin
calmly
the
more
you
change
the
more
we
shall
like
it
geoff
and
i
are
set
in
our
ways
and
are
glad
enough
to
be
let
off
duty
for
a
week
the
hut
is
yours
just
as
long
as
you
will
stay
do
just
what
you
like
with
it
though
we
pretty
good
housekeepers
too
considering
do
you
think
so
do
you
believe
he
meant
it
asked
clover
confidentially
afterward
of
hope
do
you
think
they
really
would
mind
being
tidied
up
a
little
i
should
so
like
to
give
that
room
a
good
dusting
if
it
vex
them
my
dear
they
will
probably
never
know
the
difference
except
by
a
vague
sense
of
improved
comfort
men
are
dreadfully
untidy
as
a
general
thing
when
left
to
themselves
but
they
like
very
well
to
have
other
people
make
things
neat
templestowe
told
phil
that
they
go
off
early
in
the
morning
and
come
back
till
breakfast
at
seven
so
if
i
wake
early
enough
i
shall
try
to
do
a
little
setting
to
rights
before
they
come
in
and
i
come
and
help
if
i
do
declared
hope
but
this
air
makes
me
feel
dreadfully
as
if
i
should
i
call
you
said
clover
but
it
will
be
nice
to
have
you
if
you
come
she
stood
at
her
window
after
hope
had
gone
for
a
last
look
at
the
peak
which
glittered
sharply
in
the
light
of
the
moon
the
air
was
like
scented
wine
she
drew
a
long
breath
how
lovely
it
is
she
said
to
herself
and
kissed
her
hand
to
the
mountain
you
beautiful
thing
she
woke
with
the
first
beam
of
yellow
sun
after
eight
hours
of
dreamless
sleep
with
a
keen
sense
of
renovation
and
refreshment
a
great
splashing
was
going
on
in
the
opposite
wing
and
manly
voices
hushed
to
suppressed
tones
were
audible
then
came
a
sound
of
boots
on
the
porch
and
peeping
from
behind
her
curtain
she
saw
clarence
and
his
friend
striding
across
the
grass
in
the
direction
of
the
she
glanced
at
her
watch
it
was
a
quarter
past
five
now
is
my
chance
she
thought
and
dressing
rapidly
she
put
on
a
little
cambric
jacket
knotted
her
hair
up
tied
a
handkerchief
over
it
and
hurried
into
the
her
first
act
was
to
throw
open
all
the
windows
to
let
out
the
smell
of
stale
tobacco
her
next
to
hunt
for
a
broom
she
found
one
at
last
hanging
on
the
door
of
a
sort
of
and
moving
the
furniture
as
noiselessly
as
she
could
she
gave
the
room
a
rapid
but
effectual
sweeping
while
the
dust
settled
she
stole
out
to
a
place
on
the
hillside
where
the
night
before
she
had
noticed
some
mariposa
lilies
growing
and
gathered
a
large
bunch
then
she
proceeded
to
dust
and
straighten
sorted
out
the
newspapers
wiped
the
woodwork
with
a
damp
cloth
arranged
the
disorderly
books
and
set
the
when
all
this
was
done
there
was
still
time
to
finish
her
toilet
and
put
her
pretty
hair
in
its
accustomed
coils
and
waves
so
that
clarence
and
templestowe
came
in
to
find
the
fire
blazing
the
room
bright
and
neat
hope
sitting
at
the
table
in
a
pretty
violet
gingham
ready
to
pour
the
coffee
which
choo
loo
had
brought
in
and
clover
the
good
fairy
of
this
transformation
scene
in
a
fresh
blue
muslin
with
a
ribbon
to
match
in
her
hair
just
setting
the
mariposas
in
the
middle
of
the
table
their
bells
nodded
from
a
tall
vase
of
ground
glass
oh
i
say
cried
clarence
this
something
like
is
it
scrumptious
geoff
the
hut
never
looked
like
this
before
it
wonderful
what
a
woman
no
two
women
with
a
bow
to
hope
can
do
toward
making
things
pleasant
where
did
that
vase
come
from
clover
we
never
owned
anything
so
fine
as
that
i
sure
it
came
from
my
bag
and
it
a
present
for
you
and
templestowe
i
saw
it
in
a
yesterday
and
it
occurred
to
me
that
it
might
be
just
the
thing
for
high
valley
and
fill
a
gap
and
hope
has
brought
you
each
a
pretty
it
was
a
merry
meal
the
pleasant
look
of
the
room
the
little
surprises
and
the
refreshment
of
seeing
new
and
kindly
faces
raised
templestowe
spirits
and
warmed
him
out
of
his
reserve
he
grew
cheerful
and
friendly
clarence
was
in
uproarious
spirits
and
phil
even
worse
it
seemed
as
if
the
air
of
the
high
valley
had
got
into
his
head
hope
left
at
noon
after
making
a
second
visit
to
the
lame
herder
and
hope
and
clover
settled
themselves
for
a
week
of
enjoyment
they
were
alone
for
hours
every
day
while
their
young
hosts
were
off
on
the
ranch
and
they
devoted
part
of
this
time
to
various
useful
and
decorative
arts
they
took
all
manner
of
liberties
poked
about
and
rummaged
mended
sponged
assorted
and
felt
themselves
completely
mistresses
of
the
situation
a
note
to
marian
chase
brought
up
a
big
parcel
by
stage
to
the
ute
valley
four
miles
away
from
which
it
was
fetched
over
by
a
on
horseback
and
clover
worked
away
busily
at
scrim
curtains
for
the
windows
while
hope
shaped
a
slip
cover
of
gay
chintz
for
the
shabbiest
of
the
armchairs
hemmed
a
great
square
of
canton
flannel
for
the
bare
unsightly
table
and
made
a
bright
red
pincushion
apiece
for
the
bachelor
quarters
the
took
on
quite
a
new
aspect
and
every
added
touch
gave
immense
satisfaction
to
the
boys
as
hope
called
them
who
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
effect
of
these
ministrations
though
they
had
not
the
least
idea
how
to
produce
it
themselves
creature
comforts
were
not
forgotten
the
two
ladies
amused
themselves
with
experiments
in
cookery
the
herders
brought
a
basket
of
wild
raspberries
and
clover
turned
them
into
jam
for
winter
use
clarence
gloated
over
the
little
white
pots
and
was
never
tired
of
counting
them
they
looked
so
like
new
england
he
declared
that
he
felt
as
if
he
must
get
a
girl
at
once
and
go
and
walk
in
the
graveyard
a
pastime
which
he
remembered
as
universal
in
his
native
town
various
cakes
and
puddings
appeared
to
attest
the
industry
of
the
housekeepers
and
on
the
only
wet
evening
when
a
wild
was
sweeping
down
the
valley
they
had
a
wonderful
and
made
enough
to
give
all
the
a
treat
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
all
their
time
went
in
these
domestic
pursuits
no
indeed
hope
had
brought
her
own
and
had
borrowed
one
for
clover
the
place
was
full
of
horses
and
not
a
day
passed
without
a
long
ride
up
or
down
the
valley
and
into
the
charming
little
side
canyons
which
opened
from
it
a
spirited
broncho
named
sorrel
had
been
made
over
to
phil
use
for
the
time
of
his
stay
and
he
was
never
out
of
the
saddle
when
he
could
help
it
except
to
eat
and
sleep
he
shared
in
the
herders
wild
gallops
after
stock
and
though
clover
felt
nervous
about
the
risks
he
ran
whenever
she
took
time
to
think
them
over
he
was
so
very
happy
that
she
had
not
the
heart
to
interfere
or
check
his
pleasure
she
and
hope
rode
out
with
the
gentlemen
on
the
great
day
of
the
and
stationed
at
a
safe
point
a
little
way
up
the
hillside
watched
the
spectacle
the
plunging
excited
herd
the
madly
galloping
swinging
their
long
whips
and
lassos
darting
to
and
fro
to
head
off
refractory
beasts
or
check
the
tendency
to
stampede
both
clarence
and
geoffrey
templestowe
were
bold
and
expert
riders
but
the
mexican
and
texan
herders
in
their
employ
far
surpassed
them
the
ladies
had
never
seen
anything
like
it
phil
and
his
broncho
were
in
the
midst
of
things
of
course
and
had
one
or
two
tumbles
but
nothing
to
hurt
them
only
clover
was
very
thankful
when
it
was
all
safely
over
in
their
rides
and
scrambling
walks
it
generally
happened
that
clarence
took
possession
of
clover
and
left
geoff
in
charge
of
hope
cousinship
and
old
friendship
gave
him
a
right
he
considered
and
he
certainly
took
full
advantage
of
it
clover
liked
clarence
but
there
were
moments
when
she
felt
that
she
would
rather
enjoy
the
chance
to
talk
more
with
templestowe
and
there
was
a
look
in
his
eyes
now
and
then
which
seemed
to
say
that
he
might
enjoy
it
too
but
clarence
did
not
observe
this
look
and
he
had
no
idea
of
sharing
his
favorite
cousin
with
any
one
if
he
could
help
it
sunday
brought
the
explanation
of
the
shelf
full
of
which
had
puzzled
them
on
their
first
arrival
there
was
no
church
within
reach
and
it
was
geoff
regular
custom
it
seemed
to
hold
a
little
service
for
the
men
in
the
valley
almost
all
of
them
came
except
the
few
mexicans
who
were
roman
catholics
and
the
room
was
quite
full
geoff
read
the
service
well
and
reverently
gave
out
the
hymns
and
played
the
accompaniments
for
them
closing
with
a
brief
bit
of
a
sermon
by
the
elder
arnold
it
was
all
done
simply
and
as
a
matter
of
course
and
clarence
seemed
to
join
in
it
with
much
but
clover
privately
wondered
whether
the
idea
of
doing
such
a
thing
would
have
entered
into
his
head
had
he
been
left
alone
or
if
so
whether
he
would
have
cared
enough
about
it
to
carry
it
out
regularly
she
doubted
whatever
the
shortcomings
of
the
church
of
england
may
be
she
certainly
trains
her
children
into
a
devout
observance
of
sunday
the
next
day
monday
was
to
be
their
last
a
fact
lamented
by
every
one
particularly
phil
who
regarded
the
high
valley
as
a
paradise
and
would
gladly
have
remained
there
for
the
rest
of
his
natural
life
clover
hated
to
take
him
away
but
hope
had
warned
her
privately
that
a
week
would
be
enough
of
it
and
that
with
phil
tendency
to
overdo
too
long
a
stay
would
be
undesirable
so
she
stood
firm
though
clarence
urged
a
delay
and
phil
seconded
the
proposal
with
all
his
might
the
very
pleasantest
moment
of
the
visit
perhaps
came
on
that
last
afternoon
when
geoff
got
her
to
himself
for
once
and
took
her
up
a
trail
where
she
had
not
yet
been
in
search
of
scarlet
pentstemons
to
carry
back
to
helen
they
found
great
sheaves
of
the
slender
stems
threaded
as
it
were
with
blossoms
but
what
was
better
still
they
had
a
talk
and
clover
felt
that
she
had
now
a
new
friend
geoff
told
her
of
his
people
at
home
and
a
little
about
the
sister
who
had
lately
died
only
a
little
he
could
not
yet
trust
himself
to
talk
long
about
her
clover
listened
with
frank
and
gentle
interest
she
liked
to
hear
about
the
old
grange
at
the
head
of
a
chine
above
clovelley
where
geoff
was
born
and
which
had
once
been
full
of
boys
and
girls
now
scattered
in
the
english
fashion
to
all
parts
of
the
world
there
was
ralph
with
his
regiment
in
india
he
was
the
heir
it
seemed
and
jim
and
jack
in
australia
and
oliver
with
his
wife
and
children
in
new
zealand
and
allen
at
harrow
and
another
boy
fitting
for
the
civil
service
there
was
a
married
sister
in
scotland
and
another
in
london
and
isabel
the
youngest
of
all
still
at
home
the
light
of
the
house
and
the
special
pet
of
the
old
squire
and
of
geoff
mother
who
he
told
clover
had
been
a
great
beauty
in
her
youth
and
though
nearly
seventy
was
in
his
eyes
beautiful
still
it
pretty
quiet
there
for
isabel
he
said
but
she
has
my
sister
helen
two
children
to
care
for
and
that
will
keep
her
busy
i
used
to
think
she
come
out
to
me
one
of
these
years
for
a
twelvemonth
but
there
little
chance
of
her
being
spared
now
clover
sympathy
did
not
take
the
form
of
words
it
looked
out
of
her
eyes
and
spoke
in
the
hushed
tones
of
her
soft
voice
geoff
felt
that
it
was
there
and
it
comforted
him
the
poor
fellow
was
very
lonely
in
those
days
and
inclined
to
be
homesick
as
even
a
manly
man
sometimes
is
what
an
awful
time
adam
must
have
had
of
it
before
eve
came
growled
clarence
that
evening
as
they
sat
around
the
fire
he
had
a
pretty
bad
time
after
she
came
if
i
remember
said
clover
laughing
ah
but
he
had
stuff
and
nonsense
he
was
a
long
shot
happier
without
her
and
her
old
apple
i
think
put
in
phil
you
fellows
do
know
when
you
well
off
everybody
laughed
phil
notion
of
paradise
is
the
high
valley
and
sorrel
and
no
girls
about
to
bother
and
tell
him
not
to
get
too
tired
remarked
clover
a
fair
vision
but
like
all
fair
visions
it
must
end
and
end
it
did
next
day
when
hope
appeared
with
the
carriage
and
the
bags
and
saddles
were
put
in
and
the
great
bundle
of
with
their
stems
tied
in
wet
moss
and
phil
torn
from
his
beloved
broncho
on
whose
back
he
had
passed
so
many
happy
hours
was
forced
to
accompany
the
others
back
to
civilization
i
shall
see
you
very
soon
said
clarence
tucking
the
round
clover
there
the
mail
to
fetch
and
other
things
i
shall
be
riding
in
every
day
or
two
i
shall
see
you
very
soon
said
geoff
on
the
other
side
clarence
is
not
coming
without
me
i
can
assure
you
then
the
carriage
drove
away
and
the
two
partners
went
back
into
the
house
which
looked
suddenly
empty
and
deserted
i
tell
you
what
began
clarence
and
i
tell
what
rejoined
geoff
a
house
is
worth
a
red
cent
which
has
a
woman
in
it
you
might
ride
down
and
ask
miss
perkins
to
step
up
and
adorn
our
lives
said
his
friend
grimly
miss
perkins
was
a
particularly
rigid
spinster
who
taught
a
school
six
miles
distant
and
for
whom
clarence
entertained
a
particular
distaste
you
be
hanged
i
do
mean
that
kind
i
mean
the
nice
kind
like
hope
and
your
cousin
well
i
agreed
i
shall
go
down
after
the
mail
remarked
clarence
between
the
puffs
of
his
pipe
so
shall
i
all
right
come
along
but
though
the
words
sounded
hearty
the
tone
rather
belied
them
clarence
was
a
little
puzzled
by
and
did
not
quite
like
this
newborn
enthusiasm
on
the
part
of
his
comrade
chapter
ix
over
a
pass
true
to
their
resolve
the
young
heads
of
the
high
valley
ranch
rode
together
to
helen
next
day
ostensibly
to
get
their
letters
in
reality
to
call
on
their
late
departed
guests
they
talked
amicably
as
they
went
but
unconsciously
each
was
watching
the
other
mood
and
speech
to
like
the
same
girl
makes
young
men
curiously
observant
of
each
other
a
disappointment
was
in
store
for
them
they
had
taken
it
for
granted
that
clover
would
be
as
disengaged
and
as
much
at
their
service
as
she
had
been
in
the
valley
and
lo
she
sat
on
the
piazza
with
a
knot
of
girls
about
her
and
a
young
man
in
an
extremely
fetching
costume
of
duck
with
a
flower
in
his
was
bending
over
her
chair
and
talking
in
a
low
voice
of
something
which
seemed
of
interest
he
looked
provokingly
cool
and
comfortable
to
the
dusty
horsemen
and
very
much
at
home
phil
who
lounged
against
the
opposite
dispensed
an
enormous
and
meaning
wink
at
his
two
friends
as
they
came
up
the
steps
clover
jumped
up
from
her
chair
and
gave
them
a
most
cordial
reception
how
delightful
to
see
you
again
so
soon
she
said
then
she
introduced
them
to
a
girl
in
pink
and
a
girl
in
blue
as
miss
perham
and
miss
blanchard
and
they
shook
hands
with
marian
chase
whom
they
already
knew
and
lastly
were
presented
to
wade
the
youth
in
white
the
three
young
men
eyed
one
another
with
a
not
very
friendly
scrutiny
just
veiled
by
the
necessary
outward
politeness
then
you
will
be
all
ready
for
thursday
and
your
brother
too
of
course
and
my
mother
will
stop
for
you
at
ten
on
her
way
down
they
heard
him
say
miss
chase
will
go
with
the
hopes
oh
yes
there
will
be
plenty
of
room
no
danger
about
that
we
almost
sure
to
have
good
weather
too
i
so
glad
you
enjoyed
the
roses
there
was
a
splendid
cluster
of
jacqueminot
buds
in
clover
dress
at
which
clarence
glared
wrathfully
as
he
caught
these
words
the
only
consolation
was
that
the
creature
in
duck
was
going
he
was
making
his
last
bows
and
one
of
the
girls
went
with
him
which
still
farther
reduced
the
number
of
what
in
his
heart
clarence
stigmatized
as
a
crowd
i
must
go
too
said
the
girl
in
blue
clover
i
shall
run
in
a
minute
to
talk
over
the
last
arrangements
for
thursday
what
going
to
happen
on
thursday
growled
clarence
as
soon
as
she
had
departed
oh
such
a
delightful
thing
cried
clover
sparkling
and
dimpling
old
wade
the
father
of
young
wade
whom
you
saw
just
now
is
a
director
on
the
railroad
you
know
and
they
have
given
him
the
director
car
to
take
a
party
over
the
marshall
pass
and
he
has
asked
phil
and
me
to
go
it
is
a
surprise
ever
since
we
came
to
helen
people
have
been
telling
us
what
a
beautiful
journey
it
is
but
i
never
supposed
we
should
have
the
chance
to
take
it
hope
is
going
too
and
the
doctor
and
miss
chase
and
miss
perham
all
the
people
we
know
best
in
fact
is
it
nice
oh
certainly
very
nice
replied
clarence
in
a
tone
of
deep
offence
he
was
most
unreasonably
in
the
sulks
clover
glanced
at
him
with
surprise
and
then
at
geoff
who
was
talking
to
marian
he
looked
a
little
serious
and
not
so
bright
as
in
the
valley
but
he
was
making
himself
very
pleasant
notwithstanding
surely
he
had
the
same
causes
for
annoyance
as
clarence
but
his
breeding
forbade
him
to
show
whatever
inward
vexation
he
may
have
felt
certainly
not
to
allow
it
to
influence
his
manners
clover
drew
a
mental
contrast
between
the
two
which
was
not
to
clarence
advantage
who
that
fellow
anyway
demanded
clarence
how
long
have
you
known
him
what
business
has
he
to
be
bringing
you
roses
and
making
up
parties
to
take
you
off
on
private
cars
something
in
clover
usually
soft
eyes
made
him
stop
suddenly
i
beg
your
pardon
he
said
in
an
altered
tone
i
really
think
you
should
replied
clover
with
pretty
dignity
then
she
moved
away
and
began
to
talk
to
geoff
whose
grave
courtesy
at
once
warmed
into
cheer
and
sun
clarence
thus
left
a
prey
to
remorse
was
wretched
he
tried
to
catch
clover
eye
but
she
would
look
at
him
he
leaned
against
the
balustrade
moody
and
miserable
phil
who
had
watched
these
various
interludes
with
interest
indicated
his
condition
to
clover
with
another
telegraphic
wink
she
glanced
across
relented
and
made
clarence
a
little
signal
to
come
and
sit
by
her
after
that
all
went
happily
clover
was
honestly
delighted
to
see
her
two
friends
again
and
now
that
clarence
had
recovered
from
his
there
was
nothing
to
mar
their
enjoyment
geoff
horse
had
cast
a
shoe
on
the
way
down
it
seemed
and
must
be
taken
to
the
blacksmith
so
they
did
not
stay
very
long
but
it
was
arranged
that
they
should
come
back
to
dinner
at
marsh
what
a
raving
belle
you
are
remarked
marian
chase
as
the
young
men
rode
away
three
is
a
good
many
at
a
time
though
is
it
three
what
three
hem
leaves
to
one
clover
it
the
usual
allowance
i
believe
if
there
were
four
now
oh
i
dare
say
there
will
be
they
seem
to
collect
round
you
like
wasps
round
honey
it
some
natural
law
i
presume
gravitation
or
levitation
which
is
it
i
sure
i
do
know
and
do
try
to
tease
me
poppy
people
out
here
are
so
kind
that
it
enough
to
spoil
anybody
kind
forsooth
do
you
consider
it
all
pure
kindness
really
for
such
a
belle
you
very
innocent
i
wish
you
would
protested
clover
laughing
and
coloring
i
never
was
a
belle
in
my
life
and
that
the
second
time
you
called
me
that
nobody
ever
said
such
things
to
me
in
burnet
ah
you
had
to
come
to
colorado
to
find
out
how
attractive
you
could
be
burnet
must
be
a
very
quiet
place
never
mind
you
be
teased
clover
dear
only
do
let
this
trefoil
of
yours
get
to
fighting
with
one
another
that
cousin
of
yours
was
casting
quite
murderous
glances
at
poor
thurber
wade
just
now
clarence
is
a
dear
boy
but
he
rather
spoiled
and
not
quite
grown
up
yet
i
think
when
are
you
coming
back
from
the
marshall
pass
inquired
geoff
after
dinner
when
clarence
had
gone
for
the
horses
on
saturday
we
shall
only
be
gone
two
days
then
i
will
ride
in
on
thursday
morning
if
you
will
permit
with
my
it
is
a
particularly
good
one
and
you
may
find
it
useful
for
the
distant
views
when
are
you
coming
back
demanded
clarence
a
little
later
saturday
then
i
be
in
again
before
monday
wo
you
want
your
letters
oh
i
guess
there
wo
be
any
worth
coming
for
till
then
not
a
letter
from
your
mother
she
only
writes
once
in
a
while
most
of
what
i
get
comes
from
cousin
olivia
never
did
seem
to
care
much
for
clarence
remarked
clover
after
they
were
gone
he
would
have
been
a
great
deal
nicer
if
he
had
had
a
pleasanter
time
at
home
it
makes
such
a
difference
with
boys
now
templestowe
has
a
lovely
mother
i
sure
oh
was
all
the
reply
that
phil
would
vouchsafe
how
queer
people
are
thought
little
clover
to
herself
afterward
neither
of
those
boys
quite
liked
our
going
on
this
expedition
i
think
though
i
sure
i
ca
imagine
why
but
they
behaved
so
differently
templestowe
thought
of
us
and
something
which
might
give
us
pleasure
and
clarence
only
thought
about
himself
poor
clarence
he
never
had
half
a
chance
till
he
came
here
it
is
all
his
fault
the
party
in
the
director
car
proved
a
merry
one
wade
a
jolly
motherly
woman
fond
of
the
good
things
of
life
and
delighting
in
making
people
comfortable
had
spared
no
pains
of
preparation
there
were
quantities
of
and
fans
and
the
larder
was
stocked
with
all
imaginable
dainties
iced
tea
lemonade
and
champagne
cup
flowed
on
the
least
provocation
for
all
the
hot
moments
and
each
table
was
a
bank
of
flowers
each
lady
had
a
superb
bouquet
and
on
the
second
day
a
great
tin
box
of
roses
met
them
at
pueblo
so
that
they
came
back
as
gayly
furnished
forth
as
they
went
having
the
privilege
of
the
road
the
car
was
attached
or
detached
to
suit
their
convenience
and
this
enabled
them
to
command
daylight
for
all
the
finest
points
of
the
excursion
first
of
these
was
the
royal
gorge
where
the
arkansas
river
pours
through
a
magnificent
canyon
between
precipices
so
steep
and
with
curves
so
sharp
that
only
engineering
genius
of
the
most
daring
order
could
it
would
seem
have
devised
a
way
through
then
after
a
pause
at
the
pretty
town
of
salida
with
the
magnificent
range
of
the
sangre
de
cristo
mountains
in
full
sight
they
began
to
mount
the
pass
over
long
loops
of
rail
which
doubled
and
on
themselves
again
and
again
on
their
way
to
the
summit
the
train
had
been
divided
and
the
first
half
with
its
two
engines
was
seen
at
times
puffing
and
snorting
directly
overhead
of
the
second
half
on
the
lower
curve
with
each
hundred
feet
of
elevation
the
view
changed
and
widened
now
it
was
of
hills
set
with
little
mésas
like
folds
of
green
velvet
flung
over
the
rocks
now
of
valley
depths
with
winding
links
of
silver
rivers
and
again
of
countless
mountain
peaks
against
the
sunset
sky
some
rosy
pink
some
shining
with
snow
the
flowers
were
a
continual
marvel
at
the
top
of
the
pass
eleven
thousand
feet
and
more
above
the
sea
their
colors
and
their
abundance
were
more
profuse
and
splendid
than
on
the
lower
levels
there
were
whole
fields
of
pentstemons
pink
blue
royal
purple
or
the
rare
scarlet
variety
like
stems
of
asparagus
strung
with
rubies
there
were
masses
of
gillias
and
of
wonderful
coreopsis
enormous
stars
with
centres
and
deep
yellow
ones
with
scarlet
centres
thickets
of
mentzelia
and
of
wild
rose
while
here
and
there
a
tall
red
lily
burned
like
a
little
lonely
flame
in
the
green
or
regiments
of
convolvuli
waved
their
stately
heads
from
below
came
now
and
again
the
tinkle
of
distant
these
and
the
plaintive
coo
of
in
the
branches
and
the
rush
of
the
wind
which
was
like
cool
wine
was
all
that
broke
the
stillness
of
the
high
places
to
think
i
so
much
nearer
heaven
than
when
i
was
a
boy
misquoted
clover
as
she
sat
on
the
rear
platform
of
the
car
with
poppy
and
thurber
wade
are
you
sure
your
head
does
ache
this
elevation
plays
the
mischief
with
some
people
my
mother
has
taken
to
her
berth
with
ice
on
her
temples
headache
no
indeed
this
air
is
too
delicious
i
feel
as
though
i
could
dance
all
the
way
from
here
to
the
black
canyon
you
do
look
as
if
your
head
ached
or
anything
said
wade
staring
at
clover
admiringly
her
cheeks
were
pink
with
excitement
her
eyes
full
of
light
and
exhilaration
oh
dear
we
are
beginning
to
go
down
she
cried
watching
one
of
the
beautiful
peaks
of
the
sangre
de
cristos
as
it
dipped
out
of
sight
i
think
i
could
find
it
in
my
heart
to
cry
if
it
were
not
that
we
are
coming
up
again
so
down
down
down
they
went
dusk
slowly
gathered
about
them
and
the
butler
set
the
little
tables
and
brought
in
broiled
chicken
and
grilled
salmon
and
salad
and
hot
rolls
and
peaches
and
they
were
all
very
hungry
and
clover
did
not
cry
but
fell
to
work
on
her
supper
with
an
excellent
appetite
quite
unconscious
that
they
were
speeding
through
another
wonderful
gorge
without
seeing
one
of
its
beauties
then
the
car
was
detached
from
the
train
and
when
she
awoke
next
morning
they
were
at
the
little
station
called
cimmaro
at
the
head
of
the
famous
black
canyon
with
three
hours
to
spare
before
the
train
from
utah
should
arrive
to
take
them
back
to
helen
early
as
it
was
the
small
settlement
was
awake
lights
glanced
from
the
where
cooks
were
preparing
breakfast
for
the
through
passengers
and
smokes
curled
from
the
chimneys
close
to
the
car
was
a
large
brick
structure
which
seemed
to
be
a
sort
of
hotel
for
locomotives
a
number
of
the
enormous
creatures
had
evidently
passed
the
night
there
and
just
waked
up
clover
now
watched
their
antics
with
great
amusement
from
her
window
as
their
engineers
ran
them
in
and
out
rubbed
them
down
like
horses
and
fed
them
with
oil
and
coal
while
they
snorted
and
backed
and
sidled
a
good
deal
as
real
horses
do
clover
could
not
at
all
understand
what
all
these
manoeuvres
were
for
they
seemed
only
designed
to
show
the
paces
of
the
iron
steeds
and
what
they
were
good
for
miss
clover
whispered
a
voice
outside
her
curtains
i
got
hold
of
a
and
a
couple
of
men
and
do
you
want
to
take
a
spin
down
the
canyon
and
see
the
view
with
no
smoke
to
spoil
it
just
you
and
me
and
miss
chase
she
says
she
go
if
you
will
hurry
and
do
make
a
noise
we
wo
wake
the
others
of
course
clover
wanted
to
she
finished
her
dressing
at
hurried
on
her
hat
and
jacket
stole
softly
out
to
where
the
others
awaited
her
and
in
five
minutes
they
were
smoothly
running
down
the
gorge
over
high
bridges
and
round
sharp
curves
which
made
her
draw
her
breath
a
little
faster
there
was
no
danger
the
men
who
managed
the
assured
them
it
was
a
couple
of
hours
yet
before
the
next
train
came
in
there
was
plenty
of
time
to
go
three
or
four
miles
down
and
return
anything
more
delicious
than
the
early
morning
air
in
the
black
canyon
it
would
be
difficult
to
imagine
cool
odorous
with
pines
and
with
the
breath
of
the
mountains
it
was
like
a
zestful
draught
of
iced
summer
close
beside
the
track
ran
a
wondrous
river
which
seemed
made
of
melted
jewels
so
curiously
brilliant
were
its
waters
and
mixed
of
so
many
hues
its
course
among
the
rocks
was
a
flash
of
foaming
rapids
broken
here
and
there
by
pools
of
exquisite
deepening
into
under
the
shadow
of
the
cliffs
and
such
cliffs
one
two
three
thousand
feet
high
not
like
those
about
helen
but
of
steadfast
mountain
hues
and
of
magnificent
forms
buttresses
and
spires
crags
whose
bases
were
lost
in
untrodden
forests
pinnacles
like
the
swiss
aiguilles
the
morning
was
just
making
its
way
into
the
canyon
and
the
loftier
tops
flashed
with
yellow
sun
while
the
rest
were
still
in
cold
shadow
breakfast
was
just
ready
when
the
arrived
again
at
the
upper
end
of
the
gorge
and
loud
were
the
reproaches
which
met
the
happy
three
as
they
alighted
from
it
phil
was
particularly
afflicted
i
call
it
mean
not
to
wake
a
fellow
he
said
but
a
fellow
was
sound
asleep
said
clover
i
really
had
the
heart
i
did
peep
in
at
your
curtain
and
if
you
had
moved
so
much
as
a
finger
i
should
have
called
you
but
you
did
the
return
journey
was
equally
fortunate
and
the
party
reached
helen
late
in
the
evening
of
the
second
day
in
what
wade
called
excellent
form
monday
brought
the
young
men
from
the
ranch
in
again
and
another
fortnight
passed
happily
clover
three
leaves
being
most
faithfully
attentive
to
their
central
point
of
attraction
three
is
a
good
many
as
marian
chase
had
said
but
all
girls
like
to
be
liked
and
clover
did
not
find
this
her
first
little
experience
of
the
kind
at
all
disagreeable
the
excursion
to
the
marshall
pass
however
had
an
after
effect
which
was
not
so
pleasant
either
the
high
elevation
had
disagreed
with
phil
or
he
had
taken
a
little
cold
at
all
events
he
was
distinctly
less
well
with
the
lowering
of
his
physical
forces
came
a
corresponding
depression
of
spirits
watson
worried
him
the
sick
people
troubled
him
the
sound
of
coughing
depressed
him
his
appetite
nagged
and
his
sleep
was
broken
clover
felt
that
he
must
have
a
change
and
consulted
hope
who
advised
their
going
to
the
ute
valley
for
a
month
this
involved
giving
up
their
rooms
at
marsh
which
was
a
pity
as
it
was
by
no
means
certain
that
they
would
be
able
to
get
them
again
later
clover
regretted
this
but
fate
as
fate
often
does
brought
a
compensation
watson
had
no
mind
whatever
for
the
ute
valley
it
a
dull
place
they
tell
me
and
there
nothing
to
do
there
but
ride
on
horseback
and
as
i
do
ride
on
horseback
i
really
do
see
what
use
there
would
be
in
my
going
she
said
to
clover
if
i
were
young
and
there
were
young
men
ready
to
ride
with
me
all
the
time
it
would
be
different
though
ellen
never
did
care
to
except
with
henry
of
course
after
they
and
i
really
ca
see
that
your
brother
much
different
from
what
he
was
though
if
hope
says
so
naturally
you
he
a
queer
kind
of
doctor
it
seems
to
me
to
send
lung
patients
up
higher
than
this
which
is
high
already
gracious
knows
no
if
you
decide
to
go
i
shall
just
move
over
to
the
shoshone
for
the
rest
of
the
time
that
here
i
sure
that
carr
could
expect
me
to
stay
on
here
alone
just
for
the
chance
that
you
may
want
to
come
back
when
as
like
as
not
marsh
wo
be
able
to
take
you
again
oh
no
i
quite
sure
he
would
only
i
thought
doubtfully
that
as
you
always
admired
phil
room
so
much
you
might
like
to
secure
it
now
that
we
have
to
go
well
yes
if
you
were
to
be
here
i
might
if
that
man
who
so
sick
had
got
better
or
gone
away
or
something
i
dare
say
i
should
have
settled
down
in
his
room
and
been
comfortable
enough
but
he
seems
just
about
as
he
was
when
we
came
so
there
no
use
waiting
and
i
rather
go
to
the
shoshone
anyway
i
always
said
it
was
a
mistake
that
we
did
go
there
in
the
first
place
it
was
hope
doing
and
i
have
not
the
least
confidence
in
him
he
has
osculated
me
once
since
i
came
has
he
said
clover
feeling
her
voice
tremble
and
perfectly
aware
of
the
shaking
of
phil
shoulders
behind
her
no
and
i
do
call
just
putting
his
ear
to
my
chest
listening
bangs
at
home
would
be
ashamed
to
come
to
the
house
without
his
stethoscope
i
mean
to
move
this
afternoon
i
given
marsh
notice
so
watson
and
her
belongings
went
to
the
shoshone
and
clover
packed
the
trunks
with
a
lighter
heart
for
her
departure
the
last
day
of
july
found
clover
and
phil
settled
in
the
ute
park
it
was
a
wild
and
beautiful
valley
some
hundreds
of
feet
higher
than
helen
and
seemed
the
very
home
of
peace
a
quiet
pervaded
the
place
whose
stillness
was
never
broken
except
by
and
the
rustle
of
the
pine
branches
the
sides
of
the
valley
near
its
opening
were
dotted
here
and
there
with
huts
and
cabins
belonging
to
parties
who
had
fled
from
the
heat
of
the
plains
for
the
summer
at
the
upper
end
stood
the
ranch
house
a
large
rather
rudely
built
structure
and
about
it
were
a
number
of
cabins
and
cottages
in
which
two
four
or
six
people
could
be
accommodated
clover
and
phil
were
lodged
in
one
of
these
the
tiny
structure
contained
only
a
sitting
and
two
sleeping
rooms
and
was
very
plain
and
bare
but
there
was
a
fireplace
wood
was
abundant
so
that
a
cheerful
blaze
could
be
had
for
cool
evenings
and
the
little
piazza
faced
the
south
and
made
a
sheltered
sitting
place
on
windy
days
one
pleasant
feature
of
the
spot
was
its
nearness
to
the
high
valley
clarence
and
geoff
templestowe
thought
nothing
of
riding
four
miles
and
scarcely
a
day
passed
when
one
or
both
did
not
come
over
they
brought
or
cream
or
butter
as
offerings
from
the
ranch
and
what
clover
valued
as
a
greater
kindness
yet
they
brought
phil
beloved
broncho
sorrel
and
arranged
with
the
owner
of
the
ute
ranch
that
it
should
remain
as
long
as
phil
was
there
this
gave
phil
hours
of
delightful
exercise
every
day
and
though
sometimes
he
set
out
early
in
the
morning
for
the
high
valley
and
stayed
later
in
the
afternoon
than
his
sister
thought
prudent
she
had
not
the
heart
to
chide
so
long
as
he
was
visibly
getting
better
hour
by
hour
sundays
the
friends
spent
together
as
a
matter
of
course
geoff
waited
till
his
little
home
service
for
the
ranchmen
was
over
and
then
would
gallop
across
with
clarence
to
pass
the
rest
of
the
day
there
was
no
lack
of
kind
people
at
the
main
house
and
in
the
cottages
to
take
an
interest
in
the
delicate
boy
and
his
sweet
motherly
sister
so
clover
had
an
abundance
of
volunteer
matrons
and
plenty
of
pleasant
ways
in
which
to
spend
those
occasional
days
on
which
the
high
valley
attaches
failed
to
appear
it
was
a
simple
healthful
life
the
happiest
on
the
whole
which
they
had
led
since
leaving
home
once
or
twice
thurber
wade
made
his
appearance
gallantly
mounted
and
freighted
with
flowers
and
kind
messages
from
his
mother
to
miss
carr
but
clover
was
never
sorry
when
he
rode
away
again
somehow
he
did
not
seem
to
belong
to
the
happy
valley
as
in
her
heart
she
denominated
the
place
there
was
a
remarkable
deal
of
full
moon
that
month
as
it
seemed
at
least
the
fact
served
as
an
excuse
for
a
good
many
late
transits
between
the
valley
and
the
park
now
and
then
either
clarence
or
geoff
would
lead
over
a
and
give
clover
a
good
gallop
up
or
down
the
valley
which
she
always
enjoyed
the
habit
which
she
had
extemporized
for
her
visit
to
the
high
valley
answered
very
well
and
hope
had
lent
her
a
hat
on
one
of
these
occasions
she
and
clarence
had
ridden
farther
than
usual
quite
down
to
the
end
of
the
pass
where
the
road
dipped
and
descended
to
the
little
of
canyon
creek
a
village
of
hotels
and
and
shops
for
the
sale
of
minerals
and
mineral
waters
set
along
the
steep
sides
of
a
narrow
green
valley
they
were
chatting
gayly
and
had
just
agreed
that
it
was
time
to
turn
their
horses
heads
homeward
when
a
sudden
darkening
made
them
aware
that
one
of
the
unexpected
peculiar
to
the
region
was
upon
them
they
were
still
a
mile
above
the
village
but
as
no
nearer
place
of
shelter
presented
itself
they
decided
to
proceed
but
the
storm
moved
more
rapidly
than
they
and
long
before
the
first
houses
came
in
sight
the
heavy
drops
began
to
pelt
down
a
brown
young
fellow
lying
flat
on
his
back
under
a
thick
bush
with
his
horse
standing
over
him
shouted
to
them
to
try
the
cave
waving
his
hand
in
its
direction
and
hurrying
on
they
saw
in
another
moment
a
shelving
brow
of
rock
in
the
cliff
under
which
was
a
deep
recess
to
this
clarence
directed
the
horses
he
lifted
clover
down
she
half
sat
half
leaned
on
the
slope
of
the
rock
well
under
cover
while
he
stretched
himself
at
full
length
on
a
higher
ledge
and
held
the
bridles
fast
the
horses
heads
and
the
saddles
were
fairly
well
protected
but
the
hindquarters
of
the
animals
were
presently
streaming
with
water
this
is
is
it
clarence
said
his
mouth
was
so
close
to
clover
ear
that
she
could
catch
his
words
in
spite
of
the
noisy
thunder
and
the
roar
of
the
descending
rain
no
i
call
it
fun
you
look
awfully
pretty
do
you
know
was
the
next
and
very
unexpected
remark
nonsense
not
nonsense
at
all
at
that
moment
a
carriage
dashed
rapidly
by
the
driver
guiding
the
horses
as
well
as
he
could
between
the
points
of
an
umbrella
which
constantly
menaced
his
eyes
other
travellers
in
the
pass
had
evidently
been
surprised
by
the
storm
besides
themselves
the
lady
who
held
the
umbrella
looked
out
and
caught
the
picture
of
the
group
under
the
cliff
it
was
a
suggestive
one
clover
hat
was
a
little
pushed
forward
by
the
rock
against
which
she
leaned
which
in
its
turn
pushed
forward
the
waving
rings
of
hair
which
shaded
her
forehead
but
did
not
hide
her
laughing
eyes
or
the
dimples
in
her
pink
cheeks
the
fair
slender
girl
the
dark
stalwart
young
fellow
so
close
to
her
the
rain
the
horses
it
was
easy
enough
to
construct
a
little
romance
the
lady
evidently
did
so
it
was
what
photographers
call
an
instantaneous
effect
caught
in
three
seconds
as
the
carriage
whirled
past
but
in
that
fraction
of
a
minute
the
lady
had
nodded
and
flashed
a
brilliant
sympathetic
smile
in
their
direction
and
clover
had
nodded
in
return
and
laughed
back
a
good
many
people
seem
to
have
been
caught
as
we
have
she
said
as
another
streaming
vehicle
dashed
by
i
wish
it
would
rain
for
a
week
observed
clarence
my
gracious
what
a
wish
what
would
become
of
us
if
it
did
we
should
stay
here
just
where
we
are
and
i
should
have
you
all
to
myself
for
once
and
nobody
could
come
in
to
interfere
with
me
thank
you
extremely
how
hungry
we
should
be
how
can
you
be
so
absurd
clarence
i
not
absurd
at
all
i
perfectly
in
earnest
do
you
mean
that
you
really
want
to
stay
a
week
under
this
rock
with
nothing
to
eat
well
no
not
exactly
that
perhaps
though
if
you
could
i
would
but
i
mean
that
i
would
like
to
get
you
for
a
whole
solid
week
to
myself
there
is
such
a
gang
of
people
about
always
and
they
all
want
you
clover
he
went
on
for
puzzled
at
his
tone
she
made
no
answer
could
you
like
me
a
little
i
like
you
a
great
deal
you
come
next
to
phil
and
dorry
with
me
hang
phil
and
dorry
who
wants
to
come
next
to
them
i
want
you
to
like
me
a
great
deal
more
than
that
i
want
you
to
love
me
could
you
clover
how
strangely
you
talk
i
do
love
you
of
course
you
my
cousin
i
do
care
to
be
loved
course
i
want
to
be
loved
for
myself
clover
you
know
what
i
mean
you
must
know
i
can
afford
to
marry
now
wo
you
stay
in
colorado
and
be
my
wife
i
do
think
you
know
what
you
are
saying
clarence
i
older
than
you
are
i
thought
you
looked
upon
me
as
a
sort
of
mother
or
older
sister
only
fifteen
months
older
retorted
clarence
i
never
heard
of
any
one
being
a
mother
at
that
age
i
a
man
now
i
would
have
you
remember
though
i
am
a
little
younger
than
you
and
know
my
own
mind
as
well
as
if
i
were
fifty
dear
clovy
coaxingly
could
you
you
liked
the
high
valley
did
you
i
do
anything
possible
to
make
it
nice
and
pleasant
for
you
i
do
like
the
high
valley
very
much
said
clover
still
with
the
feeling
that
clarence
must
be
half
in
joke
or
she
half
in
dream
but
my
dear
boy
it
is
my
home
i
could
leave
papa
and
the
children
and
stay
out
here
even
with
you
it
would
seem
so
strange
and
far
away
you
could
if
you
cared
for
me
replied
clarence
dejectedly
kind
argumentative
tone
was
precisely
that
which
is
most
discouraging
to
a
lover
oh
dear
cried
poor
clover
not
far
from
tears
herself
this
is
dreadful
what
moodily
having
an
offer
you
must
have
had
lots
of
them
before
now
indeed
i
never
did
people
do
do
such
things
in
burnet
please
say
any
more
clarence
i
very
fond
of
you
just
as
i
am
of
the
boys
but
but
what
go
on
how
can
i
clover
was
fairly
crying
you
mean
that
you
ca
love
me
in
the
other
way
yes
the
word
came
out
half
as
a
sob
but
the
sincerity
of
the
accent
was
unmistakable
well
said
poor
clarence
after
a
long
bitter
pause
it
is
your
fault
i
suppose
i
not
good
enough
for
you
still
i
have
done
my
best
if
you
would
have
taken
me
clover
i
am
sure
you
would
eagerly
you
always
been
my
favorite
cousin
you
know
people
ca
themselves
care
for
each
other
it
has
to
come
in
spite
of
them
or
not
at
all
at
least
that
is
what
the
novels
say
but
you
not
angry
with
me
are
you
dear
we
will
be
good
friends
always
we
persuasively
i
wonder
if
we
can
said
clarence
in
a
hopeless
tone
it
does
seem
likely
but
i
do
know
any
more
about
it
than
you
do
it
my
first
offer
as
well
as
yours
then
after
a
silence
and
a
struggle
he
added
in
a
more
manful
tone
we
try
for
it
at
least
i
ca
afford
to
give
you
up
you
the
sweetest
girl
in
the
world
i
always
said
so
and
i
say
so
still
it
will
be
hard
at
first
but
perhaps
it
may
grow
easier
with
time
oh
it
will
cried
clover
hopefully
it
only
because
you
so
lonely
out
here
and
see
so
few
people
that
makes
you
suppose
i
am
better
than
the
rest
one
of
these
days
you
find
a
girl
who
is
a
great
deal
nicer
than
i
am
and
then
you
be
glad
that
i
did
say
yes
there
the
rain
is
just
stopping
it
easy
enough
to
talk
remarked
clarence
gloomily
as
he
gathered
up
the
bridles
of
the
horses
but
i
shall
do
nothing
of
the
kind
i
declare
i
wo
chapter
x
no
piute
street
clover
did
not
see
clarence
again
for
several
days
after
this
conversation
the
remembrance
of
which
was
uncomfortable
to
her
she
feared
he
was
feeling
hurt
or
huffy
and
would
show
it
in
his
manner
and
she
disliked
very
much
the
idea
that
phil
might
suspect
the
reason
or
worse
still
templestowe
but
when
he
finally
appeared
he
seemed
much
the
same
as
usual
after
all
she
reflected
it
has
only
been
a
boyish
impulse
he
has
already
got
over
it
or
not
meant
all
he
said
in
this
she
did
clarence
an
injustice
he
had
been
very
much
in
earnest
when
he
spoke
and
it
showed
the
good
stuff
which
was
in
him
and
his
real
regard
for
clover
that
he
should
be
making
so
manly
a
struggle
with
his
disappointment
and
pain
his
life
had
been
a
lonely
one
in
colorado
he
could
not
afford
to
quarrel
with
his
favorite
cousin
and
with
him
as
with
other
lovers
there
may
have
been
besides
some
lurking
hope
that
she
might
yet
change
her
mind
but
perhaps
clover
in
a
measure
was
right
in
her
conviction
that
clarence
was
still
too
young
and
undeveloped
to
have
things
go
very
deep
with
him
he
seemed
to
her
in
many
ways
as
boyish
and
as
undisciplined
as
phil
with
early
september
the
summering
of
the
ute
park
came
to
a
close
the
cold
begins
early
at
that
elevation
and
light
frosts
and
red
leaves
warned
the
dwellers
in
tents
and
cabins
to
flee
clover
made
her
preparations
for
departure
with
real
reluctance
she
had
grown
very
fond
of
the
place
but
phil
was
perfectly
himself
again
and
there
seemed
no
reason
for
their
staying
longer
so
back
to
helen
they
went
and
to
marsh
who
in
reply
to
clover
letter
had
written
that
she
must
make
room
for
them
somehow
though
for
the
life
of
her
she
could
say
how
it
proved
to
be
in
two
small
back
rooms
an
irruption
of
eastern
invalids
had
filled
the
house
to
overflowing
and
new
faces
met
them
at
every
turn
two
or
three
of
the
last
summer
inmates
had
died
during
their
stay
one
of
them
the
very
sick
man
whose
room
watson
had
coveted
his
death
took
place
as
if
on
purpose
she
told
clover
the
very
week
after
her
removal
to
the
shoshone
watson
herself
was
preparing
for
return
to
the
east
i
seen
the
west
now
she
said
all
i
want
to
see
and
i
quite
ready
to
go
back
to
my
own
part
of
the
country
ellen
writes
that
she
thinks
i
better
start
for
home
so
as
to
get
settled
before
the
cold
and
it
so
cold
here
that
i
ca
realize
that
they
still
in
the
middle
of
peaches
at
home
ellen
always
spices
a
great
they
better
than
preserves
and
as
for
the
canned
ones
why
peaches
and
water
is
what
i
call
them
well
my
dear
distance
lends
enchantment
and
clover
had
become
my
dear
again
glad
i
could
come
out
and
help
you
along
and
now
that
you
know
so
many
people
here
you
wo
need
me
so
much
as
you
did
at
first
i
shall
tell
perkins
to
write
to
hall
to
tell
your
father
how
well
your
brother
is
looking
and
i
know
he
be
and
here
a
little
handkerchief
for
a
keepsake
it
was
a
pretty
handkerchief
of
pale
yellow
silk
with
embroidered
corners
and
clover
kissed
the
old
lady
as
she
thanked
her
and
they
parted
good
friends
but
their
intercourse
had
led
her
to
make
certain
firm
resolutions
i
will
try
to
keep
my
mind
clear
and
my
talk
clear
to
learn
what
i
want
and
what
i
have
a
right
to
want
and
what
i
mean
to
say
so
as
not
to
puzzle
and
worry
people
when
i
grow
old
by
being
vague
and
helpless
and
fussy
she
reflected
i
suppose
if
i
do
form
the
habit
now
i
be
able
to
then
and
it
would
be
dreadful
to
end
by
being
like
poor
mrs
watson
altogether
marsh
house
had
lost
its
homelike
character
and
it
was
not
strange
that
under
the
circumstances
phil
should
flag
a
little
he
was
not
ill
but
he
was
out
of
sorts
and
dismal
and
disposed
to
consider
the
presence
of
so
many
strangers
as
a
personal
wrong
clover
felt
that
it
was
not
a
good
atmosphere
for
him
and
anxiously
revolved
in
her
mind
what
was
best
to
do
the
shoshone
was
much
too
expensive
good
in
helen
were
few
and
far
between
and
all
of
them
shared
in
a
still
greater
degree
the
disadvantages
which
had
made
themselves
felt
at
marsh
the
solution
to
her
puzzle
came
as
solutions
often
do
unexpectedly
she
was
walking
down
piute
street
on
her
way
to
call
on
alice
blanchard
when
her
attention
was
attracted
to
a
small
house
on
which
was
a
sign
no
to
let
furnished
the
sign
was
not
printed
but
written
on
a
of
foolscap
which
was
what
led
clover
to
notice
it
she
studied
the
house
a
while
then
opened
the
gate
and
went
in
two
or
three
steps
led
to
a
little
piazza
she
seated
herself
on
the
top
step
and
tried
to
peep
in
at
the
closed
blinds
of
the
nearest
window
while
she
was
doing
so
a
woman
with
a
shawl
over
her
head
came
hastily
down
a
narrow
side
street
or
alley
and
approached
her
oh
did
you
want
the
key
she
said
the
key
replied
clover
surprised
of
this
house
do
you
mean
yes
mis
starkey
left
it
with
me
when
she
went
away
because
she
said
it
was
handy
and
i
could
give
it
to
anybody
who
wished
to
look
at
the
place
you
the
first
that
has
come
so
when
i
see
you
setting
here
i
just
ran
over

beloit

the
house
yes
but
i
can
let
folks
in
i
told
mis
starkey
i
air
and
dust
a
little
now
and
then
if
it
was
took
poor
soul
she
was
anxious
enough
about
it
and
it
all
had
to
be
done
on
a
sudden
and
she
in
such
a
heap
of
trouble
that
she
did
know
which
way
to
turn
it
was
just
and
go
tell
me
about
her
said
clover
making
room
on
the
step
for
the
woman
to
sit
down
well
she
come
out
last
year
with
her
man
who
had
lung
trouble
and
he
was
no
better
at
first
and
then
he
seemed
to
pick
up
for
a
while
and
they
took
this
house
and
fixed
themselves
to
stay
for
a
year
at
least
they
made
it
real
nice
too
and
slicked
up
considerable
mis
starkey
said
said
she
do
want
to
spend
no
more
money
on
it
than
i
can
help
but
starkey
must
be
made
comfortable
says
she
them
was
her
very
words
he
used
to
set
out
on
this
stoop
all
day
long
in
the
summer
and
she
alongside
him
except
when
she
had
to
be
indoors
doing
the
work
she
did
keep
no
regular
help
i
did
the
washing
for
her
and
come
in
now
and
then
for
a
day
to
clean
so
she
managed
very
well
then
wednesday
before
last
it
was
he
had
a
bleeding
and
sank
away
like
all
in
a
minute
and
was
gone
before
the
doctor
could
be
had
mis
starkey
was
all
stunned
like
with
the
shock
of
it
and
before
she
had
got
her
mind
cleared
up
so
to
order
about
anything
come
a
telegraph
to
say
her
son
was
down
with
diphtheria
and
his
wife
with
a
young
baby
and
both
was
very
low
and
between
one
and
the
other
she
was
pretty
near
out
of
her
wits
we
packed
her
up
as
quick
as
we
could
and
he
was
sent
off
by
express
and
she
says
to
me
kenny
you
see
how
is
i
got
this
house
on
my
hands
till
may
there
no
time
to
see
to
anything
and
got
no
heart
to
care
but
if
any
one
take
it
for
the
winter
well
and
good
and
i
leave
the
sheets
and
and
everything
in
it
because
it
may
make
a
difference
and
i
do
mind
about
them
nohow
and
if
no
one
does
take
it
i
just
have
to
bear
the
loss
says
she
poor
soul
she
was
in
a
world
of
trouble
surely
do
you
know
what
rent
she
asks
for
the
house
said
clover
in
whose
mind
a
vague
plan
was
beginning
to
take
shape
a
month
was
what
she
paid
and
she
said
she
throw
the
furniture
in
for
the
rest
of
the
time
just
to
get
rid
of
the
rent
clover
reflected
dollars
a
week
was
what
they
were
paying
at
marsh
could
they
take
this
house
and
live
on
the
same
sum
after
deducting
the
rent
and
perhaps
get
this
woman
to
come
in
for
a
certain
number
of
hours
and
help
do
the
work
she
almost
fancied
that
they
could
if
they
kept
no
regular
servant
i
think
i
like
to
see
the
house
she
said
at
last
after
a
silent
calculation
and
a
scrutinizing
look
at
kenny
who
was
a
faded
wiry
but
withal
person
shrewd
and
clean
a
north
of
ireland
protestant
as
she
afterward
told
clover
in
fact
her
accent
was
rather
scotch
than
irish
they
went
in
the
front
door
opened
into
a
minute
hall
from
which
another
door
led
into
a
back
hall
with
a
staircase
there
was
a
tiny
an
equally
tiny
a
small
kitchen
and
above
two
bedrooms
and
a
sort
of
unplastered
space
which
would
answer
to
put
trunks
in
that
was
all
save
a
little
woodshed
everything
was
bare
and
scanty
and
rather
particularly
ugly
the
had
a
frightful
paper
of
mingled
mustard
and
molasses
tint
and
a
matted
floor
but
there
was
a
open
fireplace
for
the
burning
of
wood
in
which
two
bricks
did
duty
for
andirons
three
or
four
splint
and
cane
bottomed
chairs
a
lounge
and
a
table
while
the
pipe
of
the
large
stove
in
the
expanded
into
a
sort
of
drum
in
the
chamber
above
this
secured
a
warm
sleeping
place
for
phil
clover
began
to
think
that
they
could
make
it
do
kenny
who
evidently
considered
the
house
as
a
wonder
of
luxury
and
convenience
opened
various
cupboards
and
pointed
admiringly
to
the
glass
and
china
the
kitchen
tins
and
utensils
and
the
cotton
sheets
and
which
they
respectively
held
there
water
laid
on
she
said
you
do
have
to
pump
any
the
washtubs
in
the
shed
that
a
real
nice
tin
boiler
for
the
clothes
i
never
see
a
nicer
mis
starkey
had
that
heater
in
the
set
the
very
week
before
she
went
away
coming
on
she
says
i
must
see
about
keeping
my
husband
warm
never
thinking
poor
thing
how
was
to
be
does
this
chimney
draw
asked
the
practical
clover
and
does
the
kitchen
stove
bake
well
i
seen
mis
starkey
take
her
biscuits
out
many
a
time
as
nice
a
brown
as
ever
you
want
and
the
chimney
do
smoke
a
mite
they
kep
a
wood
fire
here
in
may
most
all
the
time
so
i
know
clover
thought
the
matter
over
for
a
day
or
two
consulted
with
hope
and
finally
decided
to
try
the
experiment
no
was
taken
and
kenny
engaged
for
two
days
work
each
week
with
such
other
occasional
assistance
as
clover
might
require
she
was
a
widow
it
seemed
with
one
son
who
being
employed
on
the
railroad
only
came
home
for
the
nights
she
was
glad
of
a
regular
engagement
and
proved
an
excellent
and
a
great
help
to
clover
to
whom
she
had
taken
a
fancy
from
the
start
and
many
were
the
good
turns
which
she
did
for
love
rather
than
hire
for
my
little
miss
as
she
called
her
to
phil
the
plan
seemed
altogether
delightful
this
was
natural
as
all
the
fun
fell
to
his
share
and
none
of
the
trouble
a
fact
of
which
hope
occasionally
reminded
him
clover
persisted
however
that
it
was
all
fair
and
that
she
got
lots
of
fun
out
of
it
too
and
did
mind
the
trouble
the
house
was
so
absurdly
small
that
it
seemed
to
strike
every
one
as
a
good
joke
and
clover
friends
set
themselves
to
help
in
the
preparations
as
if
the
establishment
in
piute
street
were
a
kind
of
about
which
they
could
amuse
themselves
at
will
it
is
a
temptation
always
to
make
a
house
pretty
but
clover
felt
herself
on
honor
to
spend
no
more
than
was
necessary
papa
had
trusted
her
and
she
was
resolved
to
justify
his
trust
so
she
bravely
withstood
her
desire
for
several
things
which
would
have
been
great
improvements
so
far
as
looks
went
and
confined
her
purchases
to
articles
of
clear
necessity
extra
blankets
a
bedside
carpet
for
phil
room
and
a
over
which
she
could
prepare
little
impromptu
dishes
and
so
save
fuel
and
fatigue
she
allowed
herself
some
cheap
madras
curtains
for
the
parlor
and
a
few
yards
of
flannel
to
cover
sundry
shelves
and
corner
brackets
which
geoffrey
templestowe
who
had
a
turn
for
carpentry
put
up
for
her
various
loans
and
gifts
too
appeared
from
friendly
attics
and
to
help
out
hope
hunted
up
some
old
iron
firedogs
and
a
pair
of
bellows
poppy
contributed
a
pair
of
tongs
and
marsh
lent
her
a
lamp
no
began
to
look
attractive
they
were
nearly
ready
but
not
yet
moved
in
when
one
day
as
clover
stood
in
the
queer
little
parlor
contemplating
the
effect
of
geoff
last
effort
an
extra
pine
shelf
above
the
narrow
a
pair
of
arms
stole
round
her
waist
and
a
cheek
which
had
a
sweet
familiarity
about
it
was
pressed
against
hers
she
turned
and
gave
a
great
shriek
of
amazement
and
joy
for
it
was
her
sister
katy
arms
that
held
her
beyond
in
the
doorway
were
ashe
and
amy
with
phil
between
them
is
it
you
is
it
really
you
cried
clover
laughing
and
sobbing
all
at
once
in
her
happy
excitement
how
did
it
happen
i
never
knew
that
you
were
coming
neither
did
we
it
all
happened
suddenly
explained
katy
the
ship
was
ordered
to
new
york
on
three
days
notice
and
as
soon
as
ned
sailed
polly
and
i
made
haste
to
follow
there
would
have
been
just
time
to
get
a
letter
here
if
we
had
written
at
once
but
i
had
the
fancy
to
give
you
a
surprise
oh
it
is
a
nice
surprise
but
when
did
you
come
and
where
are
you
at
the
shoshone
house
at
least
our
bags
are
there
but
we
only
stayed
a
minute
we
were
in
such
a
hurry
to
get
to
you
we
went
to
and
found
phil
who
brought
us
here
have
you
really
taken
this
funny
little
house
as
phil
tells
us
we
really
have
oh
what
a
comfort
it
will
be
to
tell
you
all
about
it
and
have
you
say
if
i
have
done
right
dear
dear
katy
i
feel
as
if
home
had
just
arrived
by
train
and
polly
too
you
all
look
so
well
and
as
if
california
had
agreed
with
you
amy
has
grown
so
that
i
should
scarcely
have
known
her
four
delightful
days
followed
katy
flung
herself
into
all
clover
plans
with
the
full
warmth
of
sisterly
interest
and
though
the
hopes
and
other
kind
friends
made
many
hospitable
overtures
and
would
gladly
have
turned
her
short
visit
into
a
continuous
she
persisted
in
keeping
the
main
part
of
her
time
free
she
must
see
a
little
of
helen
she
declared
so
as
to
be
able
to
tell
her
father
about
it
and
she
must
help
clover
to
get
to
housekeeping
these
were
the
important
things
and
nothing
else
must
interfere
with
them
most
effectual
assistance
did
she
render
in
the
way
of
unpacking
and
arranging
more
than
that
one
day
when
clover
rather
to
her
own
disgust
had
been
made
to
go
with
polly
and
amy
to
denver
while
katy
stayed
behind
lo
on
her
return
a
transformation
had
taken
place
and
the
ugly
paper
in
the
parlor
of
no
was
found
replaced
with
one
of
warm
sunny
oh
why
did
you
cried
clover
it
only
for
a
few
months
and
the
other
would
have
answered
perfectly
well
why
did
you
katy
i
suppose
it
foolish
katy
admitted
but
somehow
i
could
bear
to
have
you
sitting
opposite
that
deplorable
thing
all
winter
long
and
really
and
truly
it
hardly
cost
anything
it
was
a
remnant
reduced
to
ten
cents
a
roll
the
whole
thing
was
less
than
four
dollars
you
can
call
it
your
christmas
present
from
me
if
you
like
and
i
shall
besides
that
the
other
paper
had
arsenic
in
it
i
sure
it
looked
as
if
it
had
and
corrosive
sublimate
too
clover
laughed
outright
it
was
so
funny
to
hear
katy
fertility
of
excuse
you
dear
ridiculous
darling
she
said
giving
her
sister
a
good
hug
it
was
just
like
you
and
though
i
scold
i
am
perfectly
delighted
i
did
hate
that
paper
with
all
my
heart
and
this
is
lovely
it
makes
the
room
look
like
a
different
thing
other
benefactions
followed
polly
it
appeared
had
bought
more
indian
curiosities
in
denver
than
she
knew
what
to
do
with
and
begged
permission
to
leave
a
big
and
two
with
clover
for
the
winter
and
a
splendid
striped
navajo
blanket
as
a
portière
to
keep
off
draughts
from
the
entry
katy
had
set
herself
up
in
california
blankets
while
they
were
in
san
francisco
and
she
now
insisted
on
leaving
a
pair
behind
and
loaning
clover
besides
one
of
two
beautiful
japanese
silk
pictures
which
ned
had
given
her
and
which
made
a
fine
spot
of
color
on
the
pretty
new
wall
there
were
presents
in
her
trunks
for
all
at
home
and
ned
had
sent
clover
a
beautiful
lacquered
box
somehow
clover
seemed
like
a
new
and
clover
to
katy
she
was
struck
by
the
which
had
grown
upon
her
by
her
bright
ways
and
the
capacity
and
judgment
which
all
her
arrangements
exhibited
and
she
listened
with
delight
to
hope
praises
of
her
sister
she
really
is
a
wonderful
little
creature
so
wise
and
judgmatical
and
yet
so
pretty
and
full
of
fun
people
are
quite
cracked
about
her
out
here
i
do
think
you
ever
get
her
back
at
the
east
again
worthington
there
seems
a
strong
determination
on
the
part
of
several
persons
to
keep
her
here
what
do
you
mean
but
hope
who
believed
in
the
old
proverb
about
not
addling
eggs
by
meddling
with
them
prematurely
refused
to
say
another
word
clover
when
questioned
could
not
imagine
what
hope
meant
and
katy
had
to
go
away
with
her
curiosity
unsatisfied
clarence
came
in
once
while
she
was
there
but
she
did
not
see
templestowe
katy
last
gift
to
clover
was
a
pretty
of
japanese
ware
i
meant
it
for
cecy
she
explained
but
as
you
have
none
i
give
it
to
you
instead
and
take
her
the
fan
i
meant
for
you
it
seems
more
appropriate
phil
and
clover
moved
into
no
the
day
before
the
eastern
party
left
so
as
to
be
able
to
celebrate
the
occasion
by
having
them
all
to
an
impromptu
there
was
not
much
to
eat
and
things
were
still
a
little
unsettled
but
clover
scrambled
some
eggs
on
her
little
blazer
for
them
the
fire
burned
cheerfully
and
a
good
deal
of
quiet
fun
went
on
about
it
amy
was
so
charmed
with
the
minute
establishment
that
she
declared
she
meant
to
have
one
exactly
like
it
for
mabel
whenever
she
got
married
and
a
too
just
like
clover
and
a
cunning
kitchen
and
a
stove
to
boil
things
on
mamma
when
shall
i
be
old
enough
to
have
a
house
all
of
my
own
not
till
you
are
tired
of
playing
with
dolls
i
am
afraid
well
that
will
be
never
if
i
thought
i
ever
could
be
tired
of
mabel
i
should
be
so
ashamed
of
myself
that
i
should
not
know
what
to
do
you
ought
to
say
such
things
mamma
she
might
hear
you
too
and
have
her
feelings
hurt
and
please
do
call
her
said
amy
who
had
as
strong
an
objection
to
the
word
doll
as
mice
are
said
to
have
to
the
word
cat
next
morning
the
dear
home
people
proceeded
on
their
way
and
clover
fell
to
work
resolutely
on
her
housekeeping
glad
to
keep
busy
for
she
had
a
little
fear
of
being
homesick
for
katy
every
small
odd
and
end
that
she
had
brought
with
her
from
burnet
came
into
play
now
the
photographs
were
pinned
on
the
wall
the
few
books
and
ornaments
took
their
places
on
the
extemporized
shelves
and
on
the
table
which
thanks
to
hope
was
no
longer
bare
but
hidden
by
a
big
square
of
red
canton
flannel
there
was
almost
always
a
little
bunch
of
flowers
from
the
wade
greenhouses
which
were
supposed
to
come
from
wade
and
altogether
the
effect
was
cosey
and
the
little
interior
looked
absolutely
pretty
though
the
result
was
attained
by
such
very
simple
means
phil
thought
it
heavenly
to
be
by
themselves
and
out
of
the
reach
of
strangers
everything
tasted
delicious
all
the
arrangements
pleased
him
never
was
boy
so
easily
suited
as
he
for
those
first
few
weeks
at
no
you
awfully
good
to
me
clover
he
said
one
night
rather
suddenly
from
the
depths
of
his
the
remark
was
so
little
in
phil
line
that
it
quite
made
her
jump
why
phil
what
made
you
say
that
she
asked
oh
i
do
know
i
was
thinking
about
it
we
used
to
call
katy
the
nicest
but
you
just
as
good
as
she
is
this
clover
justly
considered
a
tremendous
compliment
you
always
make
a
fellow
feel
like
home
as
geoff
templestowe
says
did
geoff
say
that
with
a
warm
sense
of
gladness
at
her
heart
how
nice
of
him
what
made
him
say
it
oh
i
do
know
it
was
up
in
the
canyon
one
day
when
we
got
to
talking
replied
phil
there
are
no
flies
on
you
he
considers
i
asked
him
once
if
he
did
think
miss
chase
pretty
and
he
said
not
half
so
pretty
as
you
were
really
you
seem
to
have
been
very
confidential
and
what
is
that
about
flies
phil
phil
you
really
must
use
such
slang
i
suppose
it
is
slang
but
it
an
awfully
nice
expression
anyway
but
what
it
mean
oh
you
must
see
just
by
the
sound
of
it
what
it
means
that
there
no
nonsense
sticking
out
all
over
you
like
some
of
the
girls
it
a
great
compliment
is
it
well
i
glad
to
know
but
templestowe
never
used
such
a
phrase
i
sure
no
he
did
admitted
phil
but
that
what
he
meant
so
the
winter
drew
on
the
strange
beautiful
colorado
winter
with
weeks
of
golden
sunshine
broken
by
occasional
storms
of
wind
and
sand
or
by
skurries
of
snow
which
made
the
plains
white
for
a
few
hours
and
then
vanished
leaving
them
dry
and
firm
as
before
the
nights
were
often
cold
so
cold
that
comfortables
and
blankets
seemed
all
too
few
and
clover
roused
with
a
shiver
to
think
that
presently
it
would
be
her
duty
to
get
up
and
start
the
fires
so
that
phil
might
find
a
warm
house
when
he
came
downstairs
then
before
she
knew
it
fires
would
seem
oppressive
first
one
window
and
then
another
would
be
thrown
up
and
phil
would
be
sitting
on
the
piazza
in
the
balmy
sunshine
as
comfortable
as
on
a
june
morning
at
home
it
was
a
wonderful
climate
and
as
clover
wrote
her
father
the
winter
was
better
even
than
the
summer
and
was
certainly
doing
phil
more
good
he
was
able
to
spend
hours
every
day
in
the
open
air
walking
or
riding
hope
horse
and
improved
steadily
clover
felt
very
happy
about
him
this
early
rising
and
were
the
hardest
things
she
had
to
encounter
though
all
the
housekeeping
proved
more
onerous
than
in
her
inexperience
she
had
expected
it
to
be
after
the
first
week
or
two
however
she
managed
very
well
and
gradually
learned
the
little
ways
which
can
only
be
learned
by
actual
experiment
getting
breakfast
and
tea
she
enjoyed
for
they
could
be
chiefly
managed
by
the
use
of
the
dinners
were
more
difficult
till
she
hit
on
the
happy
idea
of
having
kenny
roast
a
big
piece
of
beef
or
mutton
or
a
pair
of
fowls
every
monday
these
de
in
their
different
stages
of
hot
cold
and
warmed
over
carried
them
well
along
through
the
week
and
supplemented
with
an
occasional
chop
or
steak
served
very
well
fairly
good
soups
could
be
bought
in
tins
which
needed
only
to
be
seasoned
and
heated
for
use
on
table
oysters
were
easily
procurable
there
as
everywhere
in
the
west
good
and
rolls
came
from
the
bakery
and
clover
developed
a
hitherto
dormant
talent
for
cookery
and
the
making
of
graham
gems
baked
on
a
barrel
head
before
the
parlor
fire
and
wonderful
little
flaky
biscuits
raised
all
in
a
minute
with
royal
baking
powder
she
also
became
expert
in
that
other
fine
art
of
condensing
work
and
making
it
move
in
easy
grooves
her
tea
things
she
washed
with
her
breakfast
things
just
setting
the
cups
and
plates
in
the
sink
for
the
night
pouring
a
dipper
full
of
boiling
water
over
them
there
was
no
silver
to
care
for
no
delicate
glass
or
valuable
china
the
very
simplicity
of
apparatus
made
the
house
an
easy
one
to
keep
clover
was
kept
busy
for
simplify
as
you
will
providing
for
the
daily
needs
of
two
persons
does
take
time
but
she
liked
her
cares
and
rarely
felt
tired
the
elastic
and
vigorous
air
seemed
to
build
up
her
forces
from
moment
to
moment
and
each
day
fatigues
were
more
than
repaired
by
each
rest
which
is
the
balance
of
true
health
in
living
little
pleasures
came
from
time
to
time
christmas
day
they
spent
with
the
hopes
who
from
first
to
last
proved
the
kindest
and
most
helpful
of
friends
to
them
the
young
men
from
the
high
valley
were
there
also
and
the
day
was
brightly
kept
from
the
home
letters
by
the
early
mail
to
the
grand
and
dance
with
which
it
wound
up
everybody
had
some
little
present
for
everybody
else
wade
sent
clover
a
tall
plant
in
a
china
pot
which
made
a
spire
of
green
in
the
south
window
for
the
rest
of
the
winter
and
clover
had
spent
many
odd
moments
and
stitches
in
the
fabrication
of
a
gorgeous
sideboard
cloth
for
the
hopes
but
of
all
clover
offerings
the
one
which
pleased
her
most
as
showing
a
close
observation
of
her
needs
came
from
geoff
templestowe
it
was
a
prosaic
gift
being
a
of
piñon
wood
for
the
fire
but
the
gnarled
oddly
twisted
sticks
were
heaped
high
with
pine
boughs
and
long
trails
of
kinnikinnick
to
serve
as
a
christmas
dressing
and
somehow
the
gift
gave
clover
a
peculiar
pleasure
how
dear
of
him
she
thought
lifting
one
of
the
big
piñon
logs
with
a
gentle
touch
and
how
like
him
to
think
of
it
i
wonder
what
makes
him
so
different
from
other
people
he
never
says
fine
flourishing
things
like
thurber
wade
or
abrupt
rather
rude
things
like
clarence
or
inconsiderate
things
like
phil
or
satirical
funny
things
like
the
doctor
but
he
always
doing
something
kind
he
a
little
bit
like
papa
i
think
and
yet
i
do
know
i
wish
katy
could
have
seen
him
life
at
helen
in
the
winter
season
is
never
dull
but
the
gayest
fortnight
of
all
was
when
late
in
january
the
high
valley
partners
deserted
their
duties
and
came
in
for
a
visit
to
the
hopes
all
sorts
of
small
festivities
had
been
saved
for
this
special
fortnight
and
among
the
rest
clover
and
phil
gave
a
party
if
you
can
squeeze
into
the
and
if
you
can
do
with
just
for
tea
she
explained
it
would
be
such
fun
to
have
you
come
i
ca
give
you
anything
to
eat
to
speak
of
because
i
have
any
cook
you
know
but
you
can
all
eat
a
great
deal
of
dinner
and
then
you
wo
starve
thurber
wade
the
hopes
clarence
geoff
marian
and
alice
made
a
party
of
nine
and
it
was
hard
work
indeed
to
squeeze
so
many
into
the
tiny
of
no
the
very
difficulties
however
made
it
all
the
jollier
clover
which
she
prepared
before
their
eyes
on
the
blazer
her
little
tarts
made
of
crackers
split
buttered
and
toasted
brown
with
a
spoonful
of
raspberry
jam
in
each
and
the
big
loaf
of
hot
to
be
eaten
with
thick
cream
from
the
high
valley
were
pronounced
each
in
its
way
to
be
absolute
perfection
clarence
and
phil
kindly
volunteered
to
shunt
the
dishes
into
the
kitchen
after
the
repast
was
concluded
and
they
gathered
round
the
fire
to
play
twenty
questions
and
and
all
manner
of
what
clover
called
games
crambo
and
criticism
and
anagrams
and
consequences
there
was
immense
laughter
over
some
of
these
as
for
instance
when
hope
was
reported
as
having
met
watson
in
the
north
cheyenne
canyon
and
he
said
that
knowledge
is
power
and
she
that
when
larks
flew
round
ready
roasted
poor
folks
could
stick
a
fork
in
and
the
consequence
was
that
they
eloped
together
to
a
cannibal
island
where
each
suffered
a
process
of
disillusionation
and
the
world
said
it
was
the
natural
result
of
osculation
this
last
sentence
was
phil
and
i
fear
he
had
peeped
a
little
or
his
context
would
not
have
been
so
apropos
but
altogether
the
swarry
as
he
called
it
was
a
pronounced
success
it
was
not
long
after
this
that
a
mysterious
little
cloud
of
difference
seemed
to
fall
on
thurber
wade
he
ceased
to
call
at
no
or
to
bring
flowers
from
his
mother
and
it
was
learned
that
he
had
started
for
a
visit
to
the
east
no
one
knew
what
had
caused
these
phenomena
though
some
people
may
have
suspected
later
it
was
announced
that
he
was
in
chicago
and
very
attentive
to
a
pretty
miss
somebody
whose
father
had
made
a
great
deal
of
money
in
standard
oil
poppy
arched
her
brows
and
made
great
amused
eyes
at
clover
trying
to
entangle
her
into
admissions
as
to
this
or
that
and
clarence
experimented
in
the
same
direction
but
clover
was
innocently
impervious
to
these
efforts
and
no
one
ever
knew
what
had
happened
between
her
and
thurber
if
indeed
anything
had
happened
so
may
came
to
helen
in
due
course
of
time
the
and
the
were
things
of
the
past
the
tawny
yellow
of
the
plains
began
to
flush
with
green
and
every
day
the
sun
grew
more
warm
and
beautiful
phil
seemed
perfectly
well
and
sound
now
their
occupancy
of
no
was
drawing
to
a
close
and
clover
as
she
reflected
that
colorado
would
soon
be
a
thing
of
the
past
and
must
be
left
behind
was
sensible
of
a
little
sinking
of
the
heart
even
though
she
and
phil
were
going
home
chapter
xi
the
last
of
the
last
days
are
very
apt
to
be
hard
days
as
the
time
drew
near
for
quitting
no
clover
was
conscious
of
a
growing
reluctance
i
wonder
why
it
is
that
i
mind
it
so
much
she
asked
herself
phil
has
got
well
here
to
be
sure
that
would
be
enough
of
itself
to
make
me
fond
of
the
place
and
we
have
had
a
happy
winter
in
this
little
house
but
still
papa
elsie
john
it
seems
very
queer
that
i
am
not
gladder
to
go
back
to
them
i
ca
account
for
it
it
is
natural
and
it
seems
wrong
in
me
it
was
a
rainy
afternoon
in
which
clover
made
these
reflections
phil
weary
of
being
shut
indoors
had
donned
ulster
and
overshoes
and
gone
up
to
make
a
call
on
hope
clover
was
quite
alone
in
the
house
as
she
sat
with
her
beside
the
fireplace
in
which
was
burning
the
last
but
three
of
the
piñon
logs
geoff
templestowe
christmas
present
they
will
just
last
us
out
reflected
clover
what
a
comfort
they
have
been
i
would
like
to
carry
the
very
last
of
them
home
with
me
and
keep
it
to
look
at
but
i
suppose
it
would
be
silly
she
looked
about
the
little
room
nothing
as
yet
had
been
moved
or
disturbed
though
the
next
week
would
bring
their
term
of
occupancy
to
a
close
this
is
a
good
evening
to
begin
to
take
things
down
and
pack
them
she
thought
no
one
is
likely
to
come
in
and
phil
is
away
she
rose
from
her
chair
moved
restlessly
to
and
fro
and
at
last
leaned
forward
and
unpinned
a
corner
of
one
of
the
photographs
on
the
wall
she
stood
for
a
moment
irresolutely
with
the
pin
in
her
fingers
then
she
jammed
it
determinedly
back
into
the
photograph
again
and
returned
to
her
sewing
i
almost
think
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
no
she
said
half
aloud
i
wo
spoil
it
yet
we
have
one
more
pleasant
night
with
everything
just
as
it
is
and
then
i
go
to
work
and
pull
all
to
pieces
at
once
it
the
easiest
way
just
then
a
foot
sounded
on
the
steps
and
a
knock
was
heard
clover
opened
the
door
and
gave
an
exclamation
of
pleasure
it
was
geoffrey
templestowe
splashed
and
wet
from
a
muddy
ride
down
the
pass
but
wearing
a
very
bright
face
how
nice
and
unexpected
this
is
was
clover
greeting
it
is
such
a
bad
day
that
i
did
suppose
you
or
clarence
could
possibly
get
in
come
to
the
fire
and
warm
yourself
is
he
here
too
no
he
is
out
at
the
ranch
i
came
in
to
meet
a
man
on
business
but
it
seems
there
a
somewhere
between
here
and
santa
fé
and
my
man
telegraphs
that
he
ca
get
through
till
noon
so
you
will
spend
the
night
in
town
yes
i
took
marigold
to
the
stable
and
spoke
to
marsh
about
a
room
and
then
i
walked
up
to
see
you
and
phil
how
is
he
by
the
way
quite
well
i
never
saw
him
so
strong
or
so
jolly
papa
will
hardly
believe
his
eyes
when
we
get
back
he
has
gone
up
to
the
hopes
but
will
be
in
presently
you
stay
and
take
tea
with
us
of
course
thanks
if
you
will
have
me
i
was
hoping
to
be
asked
oh
we
only
too
glad
to
have
you
our
time
here
is
getting
so
short
that
we
want
to
make
the
very
most
of
all
our
friends
and
by
good
luck
there
is
a
can
of
oysters
in
the
house
so
i
can
give
you
something
hot
do
you
really
go
so
soon
our
lease
is
out
next
week
you
know
really
so
soon
as
that
it
is
soon
we
have
lived
here
nearly
eight
months
what
a
good
time
we
have
all
had
in
this
little
house
cried
geoff
regretfully
it
has
been
a
sort
of
warm
little
centre
to
us
homeless
people
all
winter
you
do
count
yourself
among
the
homeless
ones
i
hope
with
such
a
pleasant
place
as
the
high
valley
to
live
in
oh
the
hut
is
all
very
well
in
its
way
of
course
but
i
do
look
at
it
as
a
home
exactly
it
answers
to
eat
and
sleep
in
and
for
a
shelter
when
it
rains
but
you
ca
make
much
more
of
it
than
that
the
only
time
it
ever
seemed
in
the
least
was
when
you
and
hope
were
there
that
week
spoiled
it
for
me
for
all
time
that
a
pity
if
it
true
but
i
hope
it
is
it
was
a
delightful
week
though
and
i
think
you
do
the
valley
an
injustice
it
a
beautiful
place
now
if
you
will
excuse
me
i
am
going
to
get
supper
let
me
help
you
oh
there
is
almost
nothing
to
do
i
much
rather
you
would
sit
still
and
rest
you
are
tired
from
your
ride
i
sure
and
if
you
do
mind
i
bring
my
blazer
and
cook
the
oysters
here
by
the
fire
i
always
did
like
to
in
the
as
whitney
calls
it
clover
had
set
the
before
she
sat
down
to
sew
so
there
really
was
almost
nothing
to
do
geoff
lay
back
in
his
chair
and
looked
on
with
a
sort
of
dreamy
pleasure
as
she
went
lightly
to
and
fro
making
her
arrangements
which
simple
as
they
were
had
a
certain
dainty
quality
about
them
which
seemed
peculiar
to
all
that
clover
did
twisted
a
trail
of
kinnikinnick
about
the
laid
a
garnish
of
fresh
parsley
on
the
slices
of
cold
beef
and
set
a
glass
full
of
wild
crocuses
in
the
middle
of
the
table
then
she
returned
to
the
parlor
put
the
kettle
which
had
already
begun
to
sing
on
the
fire
and
began
to
stir
and
season
her
oysters
which
presently
sent
out
a
savory
smell
i
have
learned
six
ways
of
cooking
oysters
this
winter
she
announced
gleefully
this
is
a
i
wonder
if
you
approve
of
it
and
i
wonder
why
phil
does
come
i
wish
he
would
make
haste
for
these
are
nearly
done
there
he
is
now
remarked
geoff
but
instead
it
was
hope
with
a
note
dear
hope
wants
me
for
a
fourth
hand
at
whist
so
staying
if
you
do
mind
she
says
if
it
did
pour
so
ask
you
to
come
too
well
i
glad
said
clover
it
been
a
dull
day
for
him
and
now
he
have
a
pleasant
evening
only
he
miss
you
i
call
it
very
inconsiderate
of
the
little
scamp
observed
geoff
he
does
know
but
that
he
leaving
you
to
spend
the
evening
quite
alone
oh
boys
do
think
of
things
like
that
boys
ought
to
then
however
i
can
stand
his
absence
if
you
can
it
was
a
very
merry
little
meal
to
which
they
presently
sat
down
full
of
the
charm
which
the
unexpected
brings
with
it
clover
had
grown
to
regard
geoff
as
one
of
her
very
best
friends
and
was
perfectly
at
her
ease
with
him
while
to
him
poor
lonely
fellow
such
a
glimpse
of
cosey
was
like
a
peep
at
paradise
he
prolonged
the
pleasure
as
much
as
possible
ate
each
oyster
slowly
descanting
on
its
flavor
and
drank
more
cups
of
tea
than
were
at
all
good
for
him
for
the
pleasure
of
having
clover
pour
them
out
he
made
no
further
offers
of
help
when
supper
was
ended
but
looked
on
with
fascinated
eyes
as
she
cleared
away
and
made
things
tidy
at
last
she
finished
and
came
back
to
the
fire
there
was
a
silence
geoff
was
first
to
break
it
it
would
seem
like
a
prison
to
you
i
am
afraid
he
said
abruptly
what
would
i
was
thinking
of
what
you
said
about
the
high
valley
oh
you
only
seen
it
in
summer
you
know
it
quite
a
different
place
in
the
winter
i
do
believe
a
person
could
live
on
the
year
round
and
be
contented
it
would
depend
upon
the
person
of
course
if
it
were
a
lady
yourself
for
instance
could
it
be
made
anyway
tolerable
do
you
think
of
course
one
might
get
away
now
and
then
i
do
know
it
not
easy
to
tell
beforehand
how
people
are
going
to
feel
but
i
ca
imagine
the
high
valley
ever
seeming
like
a
prison
replied
clover
vexed
to
find
herself
blushing
and
yet
unable
to
help
it
geoff
manner
had
such
an
odd
intensity
in
it
if
i
were
sure
that
you
could
realize
what
it
would
be
he
began
impetuously
then
quieting
himself
but
you
do
how
could
you
ranch
life
is
well
enough
in
summer
for
a
short
time
by
way
of
a
frolic
but
in
winter
and
spring
with
the
upper
canyon
full
of
snow
and
the
road
down
muddy
and
slippery
and
the
storms
and
short
days
and
the
sense
of
being
shut
in
and
lonely
it
would
be
a
dismal
place
for
a
lady
nobody
has
a
right
to
expect
a
woman
to
undergo
such
a
life
clover
absorbed
herself
in
her
sewing
she
did
not
speak
but
still
that
deep
uncomfortable
blush
burned
on
her
cheeks
what
do
you
think
persisted
geoff
would
it
be
inexcusable
selfishness
in
a
man
to
ask
such
a
thing
i
think
said
clover
shyly
and
softly
that
a
man
has
a
right
to
ask
for
whatever
he
wants
and
she
paused
and
what
urged
geoff
bending
forward
well
a
woman
has
always
the
right
to
say
no
if
she
does
want
to
say
yes
you
tempt
me
awfully
cried
geoff
starting
up
when
i
think
what
this
place
is
going
to
seem
like
after
you
gone
and
what
the
ranch
will
be
with
all
the
heart
taken
from
it
and
the
loneliness
made
twice
as
lonely
by
comparison
i
grow
desperate
and
feel
as
if
i
could
not
let
you
go
without
at
least
risking
the
question
but
clover
let
me
call
you
so
this
once
no
woman
could
consent
to
such
a
life
unless
she
cared
very
much
for
a
man
could
you
ever
love
me
well
enough
for
that
do
you
think
it
seems
to
me
a
very
unfair
sort
of
question
to
put
said
clover
with
a
mischievous
glint
in
her
usually
soft
eyes
suppose
i
said
i
could
and
then
you
turned
round
and
remarked
that
you
were
ever
so
sorry
that
you
could
reciprocate
my
feelings
clover
catching
her
hand
how
can
you
torment
me
so
is
it
necessary
that
i
should
tell
you
that
i
love
you
with
every
bit
of
heart
that
is
in
me
and
need
you
and
want
you
and
long
for
you
but
have
never
dared
to
hope
that
you
could
want
me
loveliest
sweetest
i
do
and
i
always
shall
whether
it
is
yes
or
no
then
geoff
if
you
feel
like
that
if
you
quite
sure
you
feel
like
that
i
think
what
do
you
think
dearest
i
think
that
i
could
be
very
happy
even
in
winter
in
the
high
valley
and
papa
and
the
children
and
the
lonely
and
feelings
there
was
never
a
mention
of
them
in
this
frank
acceptance
oh
clover
clover
circumstances
alter
cases
hope
rubber
of
whist
seemed
a
long
one
for
phil
did
not
get
home
till
a
quarter
before
eleven
by
which
time
the
two
by
the
fire
had
settled
the
whole
progress
of
their
future
lives
while
the
last
logs
of
the
piñon
wood
crackled
smouldered
and
at
length
broke
apart
into
flaming
brands
in
imagination
the
little
ranch
house
had
thrown
out
as
many
wings
and
as
easily
as
a
had
been
beautified
and
made
convenient
in
all
sorts
of
ways
a
had
sprouted
round
its
base
plenty
of
room
had
been
made
for
papa
and
the
children
and
katy
and
ned
who
were
to
come
out
continually
for
visits
in
the
long
lovely
summers
they
themselves
also
were
to
go
to
and
fro
to
burnet
and
still
farther
afield
over
seas
to
the
old
devonshire
grange
which
geoff
remembered
so
fondly
how
my
mother
and
isabel
will
delight
in
you
he
said
and
the
squire
you
are
precisely
the
girl
to
take
his
fancy
we
go
over
and
see
them
as
soon
as
we
can
wo
we
clover
clover
listened
delightedly
to
all
these
schemes
but
through
them
all
like
that
young
irish
lady
who
went
over
the
marriage
service
with
her
lover
adding
at
the
end
of
every
clause
provided
my
father
gives
his
consent
she
interposed
a
little
running
thread
of
protest
if
papa
is
willing
you
know
geoff
i
ca
really
promise
anything
till
i
talked
with
papa
it
was
settled
that
until
carr
had
been
consulted
the
affair
was
not
to
be
called
an
engagement
or
spoken
of
to
any
one
only
clover
asked
geoff
to
tell
clarence
all
about
it
at
once
the
thought
of
clarence
was
in
truth
the
one
cloud
in
her
happiness
just
then
it
was
impossible
to
calculate
how
he
would
take
the
news
if
it
made
him
angry
or
very
unhappy
if
it
broke
up
his
friendship
with
geoff
and
perhaps
interfered
with
their
partnership
so
that
one
or
other
of
them
must
leave
the
high
valley
clover
felt
that
it
would
grievously
mar
her
contentment
there
was
no
use
in
planning
anything
till
they
knew
how
he
would
feel
and
act
in
any
case
she
realized
that
they
were
bound
to
consider
him
before
themselves
and
make
it
as
easy
and
as
little
painful
as
possible
if
he
were
vexatious
they
must
be
patient
if
sulky
they
must
be
forbearing
phil
opened
his
eyes
very
wide
at
the
pair
sitting
so
coseyly
over
the
fire
when
at
last
he
came
in
i
say
have
been
here
all
the
evening
he
cried
well
that
a
sell
i
would
have
gone
out
if
i
known
we
missed
you
very
much
quoth
geoff
and
then
he
laughed
as
at
some
extremely
good
joke
and
clover
laughed
too
you
seem
to
have
kept
up
your
spirits
pretty
well
considering
remarked
phil
dryly
boys
of
eighteen
are
not
apt
to
enjoy
jokes
which
do
not
originate
with
themselves
they
are
suspicious
of
them
i
suppose
i
must
go
now
said
geoff
looking
at
his
watch
but
i
shall
see
you
again
before
i
leave
i
come
in
after
i
met
my
man
all
right
said
phil
i
wo
go
out
till
you
come
oh
pray
do
feel
obliged
to
stay
in
i
ca
at
all
tell
when
i
shall
be
able
to
get
through
with
the
fellow
come
to
dinner
if
you
can
suggested
clover
phil
is
sure
to
be
at
home
then
lovers
are
like
ostriches
geoff
went
away
just
shaking
hands
casually
and
was
very
particular
to
say
miss
carr
and
he
and
clover
felt
that
they
had
managed
so
skilfully
and
concealed
their
secret
so
well
yet
the
first
remark
made
by
phil
as
the
door
shut
was
geoff
seems
queer
somehow
and
so
do
you
what
have
you
been
talking
about
all
the
evening
an
observant
younger
brother
is
a
difficult
factor
in
a
love
affair
two
days
passed
clover
looked
in
vain
for
a
note
from
the
high
valley
to
say
how
clarence
had
borne
the
revelation
and
she
grew
more
nervous
with
every
hour
it
was
absolutely
necessary
now
to
dismantle
the
house
and
she
found
a
certain
relief
in
keeping
exceedingly
busy
somehow
the
had
lost
its
inexplicable
pain
and
a
glad
little
voice
sang
all
the
time
at
her
heart
i
shall
come
back
i
shall
certainly
come
back
papa
will
let
me
i
am
sure
when
he
knows
geoff
and
how
nice
he
is
she
was
at
the
wrapping
a
row
of
books
in
paper
ready
for
packing
when
a
step
sounded
and
glancing
round
she
saw
clarence
himself
standing
in
the
doorway
he
did
not
look
angry
as
she
had
feared
he
might
or
moody
and
though
he
avoided
her
eye
at
first
his
face
was
resolute
and
kind
geoff
has
told
me
were
his
first
words
i
know
from
what
he
said
that
you
and
he
too
are
afraid
that
i
shall
make
myself
disagreeable
so
come
in
to
say
that
i
shall
do
nothing
of
the
kind
dear
clarence
that
was
what
geoff
meant
or
i
either
said
clover
with
a
rush
of
relief
and
holding
out
both
her
hands
to
him
what
we
were
afraid
of
was
that
you
might
be
unhappy
well
in
a
husky
tone
and
holding
the
little
hands
very
tight
it
is
easy
of
course
to
give
up
a
hope
i
held
on
to
mine
all
this
time
though
i
told
myself
a
hundred
times
that
i
was
a
fool
for
doing
so
and
though
i
knew
in
my
heart
it
was
no
use
now
i
had
two
days
to
think
it
over
and
get
past
the
first
shock
and
clover
i
decided
you
and
geoff
are
the
best
friends
i
got
in
the
world
i
never
seemed
to
make
friends
somehow
till
you
came
to
hillsover
that
time
nobody
liked
me
much
i
do
know
why
i
ca
get
along
without
you
two
so
i
give
you
up
without
any
hard
feeling
and
i
mean
to
be
as
jolly
as
i
can
about
it
after
all
to
have
you
at
the
high
valley
will
be
a
sort
of
happiness
even
if
you
do
come
for
my
sake
exactly
with
an
attempt
at
a
laugh
clarence
you
really
are
a
dear
boy
i
ca
tell
you
how
i
thank
you
and
how
i
admire
you
for
being
so
nice
about
this
then
that
worth
something
too
i
do
a
good
deal
to
win
your
approval
clover
so
it
all
settled
do
worry
about
me
or
be
afraid
that
i
shall
spoil
your
comfort
with
sour
looks
if
i
find
i
ca
stand
it
i
go
away
for
a
while
but
i
do
think
it
come
to
that
make
a
real
home
out
of
the
ranch
house
and
you
let
me
have
my
share
of
your
life
and
be
a
brother
to
you
and
geoff
and
i
try
to
be
a
good
one
clover
was
touched
to
the
heart
by
these
manful
words
so
gently
spoken
you
shall
be
our
dear
special
brother
always
she
said
only
this
was
needed
to
make
me
quite
happy
i
am
so
glad
you
do
want
to
go
away
and
leave
us
or
to
have
us
leave
you
we
make
the
ranch
over
into
the
dearest
little
home
in
the
world
and
be
so
cosey
there
all
together
and
papa
and
the
others
shall
come
out
for
visits
and
you
like
them
so
much
i
know
elsie
especially
does
she
look
like
you
not
a
bit
she
ever
so
much
prettier
i
do
believe
a
word
of
that
clover
heart
being
thus
lightened
of
its
only
burden
by
this
treaty
of
mutual
amity
she
proceeded
joyously
with
her
packing
hope
said
she
was
not
half
sorry
enough
to
go
away
and
poppy
upbraided
her
as
a
gay
deceiver
without
any
conscience
or
affections
she
laughed
and
protested
and
denied
but
looked
so
radiantly
satisfied
the
while
as
to
give
a
fair
color
for
her
friends
accusations
especially
as
she
could
not
explain
the
reasons
of
her
contentment
or
hint
at
her
hopes
of
return
hope
probably
had
her
suspicions
for
she
was
rather
urgent
with
clover
to
leave
this
thing
and
that
for
safe
keeping
in
case
you
ever
come
back
but
clover
declined
these
offers
and
resolutely
packed
up
everything
with
a
foolish
little
superstition
that
it
was
better
luck
to
do
so
and
that
papa
would
like
it
better
quite
a
little
group
of
friends
assembled
at
the
railway
station
to
see
her
and
phil
set
off
they
were
laden
with
flowers
and
fruit
and
natural
with
which
to
beguile
the
long
journey
and
with
many
good
wishes
and
affectionate
hopes
that
they
might
return
some
day
something
tells
me
that
you
will
hope
declared
i
feel
it
in
my
bones
and
they
hardly
ever
deceive
me
my
mother
had
the
same
kind
in
the
family
something
tells
me
that
you
must
cried
poppy
embracing
clover
but
i
afraid
it
is
bones
or
anything
prophetic
but
only
the
fact
that
i
want
you
to
so
very
much
from
the
midst
of
these
farewells
clover
eyes
crossed
the
valley
and
sought
out
mount
cheyenne
how
differently
i
should
be
feeling
she
thought
if
this
were
going
away
with
no
real
hope
of
coming
back
i
could
hardly
have
borne
to
look
at
you
had
that
been
the
case
you
dear
beautiful
thing
but
i
coming
back
to
live
close
beside
you
always
and
oh
how
glad
i
am
is
that
to
cheyenne
asked
marian
catching
the
little
wave
of
a
hand
yes
it
but
i
have
promised
him
that
it
shall
soon
be
again
mount
cheyenne
and
i
understand
each
other
i
know
you
have
always
had
a
sentimental
attachment
to
that
mountain
now
pike
peak
is
affinity
we
get
on
beautifully
together
pike
peak
indeed
i
am
ashamed
of
you
then
the
train
moved
away
amid
a
flutter
of
handkerchiefs
but
still
clover
and
phil
were
not
left
to
themselves
for
hope
who
had
a
consultation
in
denver
was
to
see
them
safely
off
in
the
night
express
and
geoff
had
some
real
or
invented
business
which
made
it
necessary
for
him
to
go
also
clover
carried
with
her
through
all
the
three
days
ride
the
lingering
pressure
of
geoff
hand
and
his
whispered
promise
to
come
on
soon
it
made
the
long
way
seem
short
but
when
they
arrived
amid
all
the
kisses
and
rejoicings
the
exclamations
over
phil
look
of
health
and
vigor
the
girls
intense
interest
in
all
that
she
had
seen
and
done
papa
warm
approval
of
her
management
her
secret
began
to
burn
guiltily
within
her
what
they
all
say
when
they
knew
and
what
did
they
say
i
think
few
of
you
will
be
at
a
loss
to
guess
life
real
life
as
well
as
life
in
is
full
of
such
shocks
and
surprises
they
are
half
happy
half
unhappy
but
they
have
to
be
borne
younger
sisters
till
their
own
turns
come
are
apt
to
take
a
severe
view
of
marriage
plans
and
to
feel
that
they
cruelly
interrupt
a
past
order
of
things
which
so
far
as
they
are
concerned
need
no
improvement
and
parents
who
say
less
and
understand
better
suffer
perhaps
more
to
bear
to
rear
to
lose
is
the
order
of
family
history
generally
unexpected
always
recurring
but
true
love
is
not
selfish
in
time
it
accustoms
itself
to
anything
which
secures
happiness
for
its
object
carr
did
confide
to
katy
in
a
moment
of
private
explosion
that
he
wished
the
great
west
had
never
been
invented
and
that
such
a
prohibitory
tax
could
be
laid
upon
young
englishmen
as
to
make
it
impossible
that
another
one
should
ever
be
landed
on
our
shores
but
he
had
never
in
his
life
refused
clover
anything
upon
which
she
had
set
her
heart
and
he
saw
in
her
eyes
that
her
heart
was
very
much
set
on
this
john
and
elsie
scolded
and
cried
and
then
in
time
began
to
talk
of
their
future
visits
to
high
valley
till
they
grew
to
anticipate
them
and
be
rather
in
a
hurry
for
them
to
begin
arrival
completed
their
conversion
nicer
than
ned
johnnie
pronounced
him
and
even
carr
was
forced
to
confess
that
the
with
which
fate
had
provided
him
were
of
a
superior
sort
only
he
wished
that
they
did
want
to
marry
girls
phil
from
first
to
last
was
in
favor
of
the
plan
and
a
firm
ally
to
the
lovers
he
had
grown
extremely
western
in
his
ideas
and
was
persuaded
in
his
mind
that
this
old
east
as
he
termed
it
with
its
puny
possibilities
did
not
amount
to
much
and
that
as
soon
as
he
was
old
enough
to
shape
his
own
destinies
he
should
return
to
the
only
section
of
the
country
worthy
the
attention
of
a
young
man
of
parts
meanwhile
he
was
perfectly
well
again
and
willing
to
comply
with
his
father
desire
that
before
he
made
any
positive
arrangements
for
his
future
he
should
get
a
sound
and
thorough
education
so
you
are
actually
going
out
to
the
wild
and
barbarous
west
to
live
on
a
ranch
milk
cows
chase
the
wild
buffalo
to
its
lair
and
hold
the
by
its
favorite
forelock
wrote
rose
red
what
was
that
you
were
saying
only
the
other
day
about
nice
convenient
husbands
who
cruise
off
for
long
times
and
leave
their
wives
comfortably
at
home
with
their
own
families
and
here
you
are
planning
to
marry
a
man
who
whenever
he
is
galloping
after
cattle
will
be
in
your
pocket
at
home
oh
clover
clover
how
inconsistent
a
thing
is
woman
not
to
say
girl
and
what
havoc
that
queer
deity
named
cupid
does
make
with
preconceived
opinions
i
did
think
i
could
rely
on
you
but
you
are
just
as
bad
as
the
rest
of
us
and
when
a
lad
whistles
go
off
after
him
wherever
he
happens
to
lead
and
think
it
the
best
thing
possible
to
do
so
it
a
mad
world
my
masters
and
i
thankful
that
roslein
is
only
four
and
a
half
years
old
and
clover
answer
was
one
line
on
a
postal
card
guilty
but
recommended
to
mercy
