by

norris
the
following
novel
was
completed
march
and
sent
to
the
printer
in
october
of
the
same
year
after
the
plates
had
been
made
notice
was
received
that
a
play
called
a
man
woman
had
been
written
by
anne
crawford
flexner
and
that
this
title
had
been
copyrighted
as
it
was
impossible
to
change
the
name
of
the
novel
at
the
time
this
notice
was
received
it
has
been
published
under
its
original
title
new

a
man
woman
i
at
four
in
the
morning
everybody
in
the
tent
was
still
asleep
exhausted
by
the
terrible
march
of
the
previous
day
the
hummocky
ice
and
that
bennett
had
foreseen
had
at
last
been
met
with
and
though
camp
had
been
broken
at
six
and
though
men
and
dogs
had
hauled
and
tugged
and
wrestled
with
the
heavy
sledges
until
five
in
the
afternoon
only
a
mile
and
a
half
had
been
covered
but
though
the
progress
was
slow
it
was
yet
progress
it
was
not
the
harrowing
immobility
of
those
long
months
aboard
the
freja
every
yard
to
the
southward
though
won
at
the
expense
of
a
battle
with
the
ice
brought
them
nearer
to
wrangel
island
and
ultimate
safety
then
too
at
the
unexpected
had
happened
bennett
moved
no
doubt
by
their
weakened
condition
had
dealt
out
extra
rations
to
each
man
one
and
ounces
of
butter
and
six
and
ounces
of
aleuronate
bread
a
veritable
luxury
after
the
unvarying
diet
of
pemmican
lime
juice
and
dried
potatoes
of
the
past
fortnight
the
men
had
got
into
their
early
and
until
four
in
the
morning
had
slept
profoundly
inert
stupefied
almost
without
movement
but
a
few
minutes
after
four
bennett
awoke
he
was
usually
up
about
half
an
hour
before
the
others
on
the
day
before
he
had
been
able
to
get
a
meridian
altitude
of
the
sun
and
was
anxious
to
complete
his
calculations
as
to
the
expedition
position
on
the
chart
that
he
had
begun
in
the
evening
he
pushed
back
the
flap
of
the
and
rose
to
his
full
height
passing
his
hands
over
his
face
rubbing
the
sleep
from
his
eyes
he
was
an
enormous
man
standing
six
feet
two
inches
in
his
reindeer
footnips
and
having
the
look
more
of
a
than
of
a
scientist
even
making
allowances
for
its
coating
of
dirt
and
its
harsh
black
stubble
of
half
a
week
growth
the
face
was
not
pleasant
bennett
was
an
ugly
man
his
lower
jaw
was
huge
almost
to
deformity
like
that
of
the
bulldog
the
chin
salient
the
mouth
with
great
lips
indomitable
brutal
the
forehead
was
contracted
and
small
the
forehead
of
men
of
single
ideas
and
the
eyes
too
were
small
and
twinkling
one
of
them
marred
by
a
sharply
defined
cast
but
as
bennett
was
fumbling
in
the
tin
box
that
was
lashed
upon
the
number
four
sledge
looking
for
his
notebook
wherein
he
had
begun
his
calculations
for
latitude
he
was
surprised
to
find
a
copy
of
the
record
he
had
left
in
the
instrument
box
under
the
cairn
at
cape
kammeni
at
the
beginning
of
this
southerly
march
he
had
supposed
that
this
copy
had
been
mislaid
and
was
not
a
little
relieved
to
come
across
it
now
he
read
it
through
hastily
his
mind
reviewing
again
the
incidents
of
the
last
few
months
certain
extracts
of
this
record
ran

bennett
commanding

arctic
exploring
expedition
bennett
returned
this
copy
of
the
record
to
its
place
in
the
box
and
stood
for
a
moment
in
the
centre
of
the
tent
his
head
bent
to
avoid
the
looking
thoughtfully
upon
the
ground
well
so
far
all
had
gone
right
no
scurvy
provisions
in
plenty
the
dogs
were
in
good
condition
his
men
cheerful
trusting
in
him
as
in
a
god
and
surely
no
leader
could
wish
for
a
better
lieutenant
and
comrade
than
richard
ferriss
but
this
hummocky
ice
these
which
the
expedition
had
met
the
day
before
instead
of
turning
at
once
to
his
ciphering
bennett
drew
the
hood
of
the
wolfskin
coat
over
his
head
buttoned
a
red
flannel
mask
across
his
face
and
raising
the
flap
of
the
tent
stepped
outside
under
the
lee
of
the
tent
the
dogs
were
sleeping
moveless
bundles
of
fur
black
and
white
perceptibly
steaming
the
three
great
mcclintock
sledges
weighted
down
with
the
freja
boats
and
with
the
impedimenta
lay
where
they
had
been
halted
the
evening
before
in
the
sky
directly
in
front
of
bennett
as
he
issued
from
the
tent
three
moons
hooped
in
a
vast
circle
of
nebulous
light
shone
roseate
through
a
fine
mist
while
in
the
western
heavens
streamers
of
green
orange
and
vermilion
light
immeasurably
vast
were
shooting
noiselessly
from
horizon
to
zenith
but
bennett
had
more
on
his
mind
that
morning
than
and
auroras
to
the
south
and
east
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
tent
the
pressure
of
the
floes
had
thrown
up
an
enormous
ridge
of
shattered
a
mound
a
long
hill
of
slabs
and
blocks
huddling
together
at
every
conceivable
angle
it
was
nearly
twenty
feet
in
height
quite
the
highest
point
that
bennett
could
discover
scrambling
and
climbing
over
countless
other
ridges
that
intervened
he
made
his
way
to
it
ascended
it
almost
on
hands
and
knees
and
standing
upon
its
highest
point
looked
long
and
carefully
to
the
southward
a
wilderness
beyond
all
thought
words
or
imagination
desolate
stretched
out
before
him
there
forever
and
forever
ice
ice
ice
fields
and
floes
of
ice
laying
themselves
out
under
that
gloomy
sky
league
after
league
endless
sombre
infinitely
vast
infinitely
formidable
but
now
it
was
no
longer
the
smooth
ice
over
which
the
expedition
had
for
so
long
been
travelling
in
every
direction
intersecting
one
another
at
ten
thousand
points
crossing
and
recrossing
weaving
a
gigantic
bewildering
network
of
gashed
jagged
splintered
ran
the
and
hummocks
in
places
a
score
or
more
of
these
ridges
had
been
wedged
together
to
form
one
huge
field
of
broken
slabs
of
ice
miles
in
width
miles
in
length
from
horizon
to
horizon
there
was
no
level
place
no
open
water
no
pathway
the
view
to
the
southward
resembled
a
ocean
suddenly
frozen
one
of
these
ridges
bennett
had
just
climbed
and
upon
it
he
now
stood
even
for
him
unencumbered
carrying
no
weight
the
climb
had
been
difficult
more
than
once
he
had
slipped
and
fallen
at
times
he
had
been
obliged
to
go
forward
almost
on
his
hands
and
knees
and
yet
it
was
across
that
jungle
of
ice
that
unspeakable
tangle
of
slabs
and
cakes
and
blocks
that
the
expedition
must
now
advance
dragging
its
boats
its
sledges
its
provisions
instruments
and
baggage
bennett
stood
looking
before
him
lay
his
task
there
under
his
eyes
was
the
enemy
face
to
face
with
him
was
the
titanic
primal
strength
of
a
chaotic
world
the
stupendous
still
force
of
a
merciless
nature
waiting
calmly
waiting
silently
to
close
upon
and
crush
him
for
a
long
time
he
stood
watching
then
the
great
brutal
jaw
grew
more
salient
than
ever
the
teeth
set
and
clenched
behind
the
lips
the
cast
in
the
small
twinkling
eyes
grew
suddenly
more
pronounced
one
huge
fist
raised
and
the
arm
slowly
extended
forward
like
the
resistless
moving
of
a
piston
then
when
his
arm
was
at
its
full
reach
bennett
spoke
as
though
in
answer
to
the
voiceless
terrible
challenge
of
the
ice
through
his
clenched
teeth
his
words
came
slow
and
measured
but
i
break
you
by
god
believe
me
i
will
after
a
while
he
returned
to
the
tent
awoke
the
cook
and
while
breakfast
was
being
prepared
completed
his
calculations
for
latitude
wrote
up
his
and
noted
down
the
temperature
and
the
direction
and
velocity
of
the
wind
as
he
was
finishing
richard
ferriss
who
was
the
chief
engineer
and
second
in
command
awoke
and
immediately
asked
the
latitude
answered
bennett
without
looking
up
repeated
ferriss
nodding
his
head
we
make
much
distance
yesterday
i
hope
we
can
make
as
much
returned
bennett
grimly
as
he
put
away
his
and
how
the
ice
to
the
bad
wake
the
men
after
breakfast
and
while
the
mcclintocks
were
being
loaded
bennett
sent
ferriss
on
ahead
to
choose
a
road
through
and
over
the
ridges
it
was
dreadful
work
for
two
hours
ferriss
wandered
about
amid
the
broken
ice
all
but
hopelessly
bewildered
but
at
length
to
his
great
satisfaction
he
beheld
a
fairly
open
stretch
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
in
length
lying
out
to
the
southwest
and
not
too
far
out
of
the
expedition
line
of
march
some
dozen
ridges
would
have
to
be
crossed
before
this
level
was
reached
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
so
ferriss
planted
his
flags
where
the
heaps
of
seemed
least
impracticable
and
returned
toward
the
camp
it
had
already
been
broken
and
on
his
way
he
met
the
entire
expedition
involved
in
the
intricacies
of
the
first
rough
ice
all
of
the
eighteen
dogs
had
been
harnessed
to
the
number
two
sledge
that
carried
the
whaleboat
and
the
major
part
of
the
provisions
and
every
man
of
the
party
bennett
included
was
straining
at
the
with
the
dogs
foot
by
foot
the
sledge
came
over
the
ridge
grinding
and
lurching
among
the
then
partly
by
guiding
partly
by
lifting
it
was
piloted
down
the
slope
only
in
the
end
to
escape
from
all
control
and
come
crashing
downward
among
the
dogs
jolting
one
of
the
medicine
chests
from
its
lashings
and
butting
its
nose
heavily
against
the
foot
of
the
next
hummock
immediately
beyond
but
the
men
scrambled
to
their
places
again
the
medicine
chest
was
replaced
and
muck
tu
the
esquimau
whipped
forward
his
dogs
ferriss
too
laid
hold
the
next
hummock
was
surmounted
the
dogs
panting
and
the
men
even
in
that
icy
air
reeking
with
perspiration
then
suddenly
and
without
the
least
warning
bennett
and
mcpherson
who
were
in
the
lead
broke
through
some
young
ice
into
water
up
to
their
breasts
muck
tu
and
one
of
the
dogs
breaking
through
immediately
afterward
the
men
were
pulled
out
or
of
their
own
efforts
climbed
upon
the
ice
again
but
in
an
instant
their
clothes
were
frozen
to
rattling
armor
bear
off
to
the
here
commanded
bennett
shaking
the
icy
stinging
water
from
his
sleeves
everybody
on
the
ropes
now
another
was
surmounted
then
a
third
and
by
an
hour
after
the
start
they
had
arrived
at
the
first
one
of
ferriss
flags
here
the
number
two
sledge
was
left
and
the
entire
expedition
dogs
and
men
returned
to
camp
to
bring
up
the
number
one
mcclintock
loaded
with
the
freja
cutter
and
with
the
instruments
and
tent
this
sledge
was
successfully
dragged
over
the
first
two
hummocks
but
as
it
was
being
hauled
up
the
third
its
runner
suddenly
buckled
and
turned
under
it
with
a
loud
snap
there
was
nothing
for
it
now
but
to
remove
the
entire
load
and
to
set
hawes
the
carpenter
to
work
upon
its
repair
up
your
other
sledge
ordered
bennett
once
more
the
expedition
returned
to
the
morning
and
harnessing
itself
to
the
third
mcclintock
struggled
forward
with
it
for
an
hour
and
a
half
until
it
was
up
with
the
first
sledge
and
flag
fortunately
the
two
four
and
five
were
light
and
bennett
dividing
his
forces
brought
them
up
in
a
single
haul
but
hawes
called
out
that
the
broken
sledge
was
now
repaired
the
men
turned
to
at
once
reloaded
it
and
hauled
it
onward
so
that
by
noon
every
sledge
had
been
moved
forward
quite
a
quarter
of
a
mile
but
now
for
the
moment
the
men
after
going
over
the
same
ground
seven
times
were
used
up
and
muck
tu
could
no
longer
whip
the
dogs
to
their
work
bennett
called
a
halt
hot
tea
was
made
and
pemmican
and
hardtack
served
out
we
have
easier
hauling
this
afternoon
men
said
bennett
this
next
ridge
is
the
worst
of
the
lot
beyond
that
ferriss
says
got
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
level
floes
on
again
at
one
but
the
hummock
of
which
bennett
had
spoken
proved
absolutely
impassable
for
the
loaded
sledges
it
was
all
one
that
the
men
lay
to
the
ropes
like
and
that
muck
tu
flogged
the
dogs
till
the
goad
broke
in
his
hands
the
men
lost
their
footing
upon
the
slippery
ice
and
fell
to
their
knees
the
dogs
laid
down
in
the
traces
groaning
and
whining
the
sledge
would
not
move
unload
commanded
bennett
the
lashings
were
taken
off
and
the
loads
including
the
great
cumbersome
whaleboat
itself
carried
over
the
hummock
by
hand
then
the
sledge
itself
was
hauled
over
and
reloaded
upon
the
other
side
thus
the
whole
five
sledges
the
work
was
bitter
hard
the
knots
of
the
lashings
were
frozen
tight
and
coated
with
ice
the
cases
of
provisions
the
medicine
chests
the
canvas
bundle
of
sails
and
tents
unwieldy
and
of
enormous
weight
the
footing
on
the
slippery
uneven
ice
precarious
and
more
than
once
a
man
staggering
under
his
load
broke
through
the
crust
into
water
so
cold
that
the
sensation
was
like
that
of
burning
but
at
last
everything
was
over
the
sledges
reloaded
and
the
forward
movement
resumed
only
one
low
hummock
now
intervened
between
them
and
the
level
floe
however
as
they
were
about
to
start
forward
again
a
lamentable
gigantic
sound
began
vibrating
in
their
ears
a
rumbling
groaning
note
rising
by
quick
degrees
to
a
strident
shriek
other
sounds
hollow
and
shrill
treble
mingling
with
diapason
joined
in
the
first
the
noise
came
from
just
beyond
the
at
the
foot
of
which
the
party
had
halted
forward
shouted
bennett
hurry
there
men
desperately
eager
the
men
bent
panting
to
their
work
the
sledge
bearing
the
whaleboat
topped
the
hummock
now
then
over
with
her
cried
ferriss
but
it
was
too
late
as
they
stood
looking
down
upon
it
for
an
instant
the
level
floe
their
one
sustaining
hope
during
all
the
day
suddenly
cracked
from
side
to
side
with
the
noise
of
ordnance
then
the
groaning
and
shrieking
recommenced
the
crack
immediately
closed
up
the
pressure
on
the
sides
of
the
floe
began
again
and
on
the
smooth
surface
of
the
ice
domes
and
mounds
abruptly
reared
themselves
as
the
pressure
increased
these
domes
and
mounds
cracked
and
burst
into
countless
blocks
and
slabs
ridge
after
ridge
was
formed
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
thundering
like
a
cannonade
of
siege
guns
the
whole
floe
burst
up
jagged
splintered
hummocky
in
less
than
three
minutes
and
while
the
freja
men
stood
watching
the
level
stretch
toward
which
since
morning
they
had
struggled
with
incalculable
toil
was
ground
up
into
a
vast
mass
of
confused
and
pathless
rubble
oh
this
will
never
do
muttered
ferriss
disheartened
come
on
men
exclaimed
bennett
ferriss
go
forward
and
choose
a
road
for
us
the
labour
of
the
morning
was
recommenced
with
infinite
patience
infinite
hardship
the
sledges
one
by
one
were
advanced
so
heavy
were
the
three
larger
mcclintocks
that
only
one
could
be
handled
at
a
time
and
that
one
taxed
the
combined
efforts
of
men
and
dogs
to
the
uttermost
the
same
ground
had
to
be
covered
seven
times
for
every
yard
gained
seven
had
to
be
travelled
it
was
not
a
march
it
was
a
battle
a
battle
without
rest
and
without
end
and
without
mercy
a
battle
with
an
enemy
whose
power
was
beyond
all
estimate
and
whose
movements
were
not
reducible
to
any
known
law
a
certain
course
would
be
mapped
certain
plans
formed
a
certain
objective
determined
and
before
the
course
could
be
finished
the
plans
executed
or
the
objective
point
attained
the
perverse
inexplicable
movement
of
the
ice
baffled
their
determination
and
set
at
naught
their
best
ingenuity
at
four
it
began
to
snow
since
the
middle
of
the
forenoon
the
horizon
had
been
obscured
by
clouds
and
mist
so
that
no
observation
for
position
could
be
taken
steadily
the
clouds
had
advanced
and
by
four
the
expedition
found
itself
enveloped
by
wind
and
driving
snow
the
flags
could
no
longer
be
distinguished
thin
and
treacherous
ice
was
concealed
under
drifts
the
dogs
floundered
helplessly
the
men
could
scarcely
open
their
eyes
against
the
wind
and
fine
snow
and
at
times
when
they
came
to
drag
forward
the
last
sledge
they
found
it
so
nearly
buried
in
the
snow
that
it
must
be
dug
out
before
it
could
be
moved
toward
half
past
five
the
odometer
on
one
of
the
registered
a
distance
of
of
a
mile
made
since
morning
bennett
called
a
halt
and
camp
was
pitched
in
the
lee
of
one
of
the
larger
hummocks
the
alcohol
cooker
was
set
going
and
supper
was
had
under
the
tent
the
men
eating
as
they
lay
in
their
but
even
while
eating
they
fell
asleep
drooping
lower
and
lower
finally
collapsing
upon
the
canvas
floor
of
the
tent
the
food
still
in
their
mouths
yet
for
all
that
the
night
was
miserable
even
after
that
day
of
superhuman
struggle
they
were
not
to
be
allowed
a
few
hours
of
unbroken
rest
by
midnight
the
wind
had
veered
to
the
east
and
was
blowing
a
gale
an
hour
later
the
tent
came
down
exhausted
as
they
were
they
must
turn
out
and
wrestle
with
that
slatting
canvas
and
it
was
not
until
half
an
hour
later
that
everything
was
fast
again
once
more
they
crawled
into
the
but
soon
the
heat
from
their
bodies
melted
the
ice
upon
their
clothes
and
pools
of
water
formed
under
each
man
wetting
him
to
the
skin
sleep
was
impossible
it
grew
colder
and
colder
as
the
night
advanced
and
the
gale
increased
at
three
in
the
morning
the
centigrade
thermometer
was
at
eighteen
degrees
below
the
cooker
was
lighted
again
and
until
six
the
party
huddled
wretchedly
about
it
dozing
and
waking
shivering
continually
breakfast
at
half
past
six
under
way
again
an
hour
later
there
was
no
change
in
the
nature
of
the
ice
ridge
succeeded
ridge
hummock
followed
upon
hummock
the
wind
was
going
down
but
the
snow
still
fell
as
fine
and
bewildering
as
ever
the
cold
was
intense
dennison
the
doctor
and
naturalist
of
the
expedition
having
slipped
his
mitten
had
his
hand
frostbitten
before
he
could
recover
it
two
of
the
dogs
big
joe
and
stryelka
were
noticeably
giving
out
but
bennett
his
huge
jaws
clenched
his
small
distorted
eyes
twinkling
viciously
through
the
apertures
of
the
his
harsh
black
eyebrows
lowering
under
the
narrow
contracted
forehead
drove
the
expedition
to
its
work
relentlessly
not
muck
tu
the
had
his
ostiaks
more
completely
under
his
control
than
he
his
men
he
himself
did
the
work
of
three
on
that
vast
frame
of
bone
and
muscle
fatigue
seemed
to
leave
no
trace
upon
that
inexorable
bestial
determination
difficulties
beyond
belief
left
no
mark
not
one
of
the
twelve
men
under
his
command
fighting
the
stubborn
ice
with
tooth
and
nail
who
was
not
galvanised
with
his
tremendous
energy
it
was
as
though
a
spur
was
in
their
flanks
a
lash
upon
their
backs
their
minds
their
wills
their
efforts
their
physical
strength
to
the
last
ounce
and
pennyweight
belonged
indissolubly
to
him
for
the
time
being
they
were
his
slaves
his
serfs
his
beasts
of
burden
his
draught
animals
no
better
than
the
dogs
straining
in
the
traces
beside
them
forward
they
must
and
would
go
until
they
dropped
in
the
harness
or
he
gave
the
word
to
pause
at
four
in
the
afternoon
bennett
halted
two
miles
had
been
made
since
the
last
camp
and
now
human
endurance
could
go
no
farther
sometimes
when
the
men
fell
they
were
unable
to
get
up
it
was
evident
there
was
no
more
in
them

day

stryelka

and

and
every

the
next
morning
was
clear
for
two
hours
after
breakfast
and
when
ferriss
returned
from
his
task
of
he
reported
to
bennett
that
he
had
seen
a
great
many
off
to
the
southwest
the
wind
of
yesterday
has
broken
the
ice
up
observed
bennett
we
shall
have
hard
work
a
little
after
midday
at
a
time
when
they
had
wrested
some
thousand
yards
to
the
southward
from
the
grip
of
the
ice
the
expedition
came
to
the
first
lane
of
open
water
about
three
hundred
feet
in
width
bennett
halted
the
sledges
and
at
once
set
about
constructing
a
bridge
of
floating
cakes
of
ice
but
the
work
of
keeping
these
in
place
long
enough
for
the
transfer
of
even
a
single
sledge
seemed
at
times
to
be
beyond
their
most
strenuous
endeavour
the
first
sledge
with
the
cutter
crossed
in
safety
then
came
the
turn
of
number
two
loaded
with
the
provisions
and
whaleboat
it
was
of
the
way
across
when
the
opposite
side
of
the
floe
abruptly
shifted
its
position
and
thirty
feet
of
open
water
suddenly
widened
out
directly
in
front
of
the
line
of
progress
cut
loose
commanded
bennett
upon
the
instant
the
upon
which
they
were
gathered
was
set
free
in
the
current
the
situation
was
one
of
the
greatest
peril
the
entire
expedition
men
and
dogs
together
with
their
most
important
sledge
was
adrift
but
the
oars
and
mast
and
the
pole
of
the
tent
were
had
from
the
whaleboat
and
little
by
little
they
ferried
themselves
across
the
gap
was
bridged
again
and
the
transferred
but
now
occurred
the
first
real
disaster
since
the
destruction
of
the
ship
across
the
crazy
pontoon
bridge
of
ice
the
dogs
harnessed
to
one
of
the
small
sleds
became
suddenly
terrified
before
any
one
could
interfere
they
had
bolted
from
muck
tu
control
in
a
wild
break
for
the
farther
side
of
the
ice
the
sled
was
overturned
the
dogs
threw
themselves
into
the
water
the
sled
sank
the
parted
and
two
medicine
chests
the
bag
of
sewing
materials
of
priceless
worth
a
coil
of
wire
ropes
and
three
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
of
pemmican
were
lost
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
without
comment
bennett
at
once
addressed
himself
to
making
the
best
of
the
business
the
dogs
were
hauled
upon
the
ice
the
few
loads
that
yet
remained
upon
the
sled
were
transferred
to
another
that
sled
was
abandoned
and
once
more
the
expedition
began
its
battle
to
the
southward
the
lanes
of
open
water
as
foreshadowed
by
the
that
ferriss
had
noted
in
the
morning
were
frequent
alternating
steadily
with
hummocks
and
but
the
perversity
of
the
ice
was
all
but
at
every
hour
the
lanes
opened
and
closed
at
one
time
in
the
afternoon
they
had
arrived
upon
the
edge
of
a
lane
wide
enough
to
justify
them
in
taking
to
their
boats
the
sledges
were
unloaded
and
stowed
upon
the
boats
themselves
and
oars
and
sails
made
ready
then
as
bennett
was
about
to
launch
the
lane
suddenly
closed
up
what
had
been
water
became
a
level
floe
and
again
the
process
of
unloading
and
reloading
had
to
be
undertaken
that
evening
big
joe
and
two
other
dogs
gavriga
and
patsy
were
shot
because
of
their
uselessness
in
the
traces
their
bodies
were
cut
up
to
feed
their
mates
i
can
spare
the
dogs
wrote
bennett
in
his
journal
for
that
day
a
sunday
but
mcpherson
one
of
the
best
men
of
the
command
gives
me
some
uneasiness
his
frozen
footnips
have
chafed
sores
in
his
ankle
one
of
these
has
ulcerated
and
the
doctor
tells
me
is
in
a
serious
condition
his
pain
is
so
great
that
he
can
no
longer
haul
with
the
others
shall
relieve
him
from
work
during
the
morrow
march
less
than
a
mile
covered
meridian
observation
for
latitude
impossible
on
account
of
fog
divine
services
at
a
week
passed
then
another
there
was
no
change
neither
in
the
character
of
the
ice
nor
in
the
expedition
daily
routine
their
toil
was
incredible
at
times
an
hour
unremitting
struggle
would
gain
but
a
few
yards
the
dogs
instead
of
aiding
them
were
rapidly
becoming
mere
encumbrances
four
more
had
been
killed
a
fifth
had
been
drowned
and
two
wandering
from
camp
had
never
returned
the
second
had
been
abandoned
the
condition
of
mcpherson
foot
was
such
that
no
work
could
be
demanded
from
him
hawes
the
carpenter
was
down
with
fever
and
kept
everybody
awake
all
night
by
talking
in
his
sleep
worse
than
all
however
ferriss
right
hand
was
again
frostbitten
and
this
time
dennison
the
doctor
was
obliged
to
amputate
it
above
the
wrist
but
i
am
no
whit
disheartened
wrote
bennett
succeed
i
must
and
shall
a
few
days
after
the
operation
on
ferriss
hand
bennett
decided
it
would
be
advisable
to
allow
the
party
a
full
hours
rest
the
march
of
the
day
before
had
been
harder
than
any
they
had
yet
experienced
and
in
addition
to
mcpherson
and
the
carpenter
the
doctor
himself
was
upon
the
sick
list
in
the
evening
bennett
and
ferriss
took
a
long
walk
or
rather
climb
over
the
ice
to
the
southwest
picking
out
a
course
for
the
next
day
march
a
great
friendship
not
to
say
affection
had
sprung
up
between
these
two
men
a
result
of
their
long
and
close
intimacy
on
board
the
freja
and
of
the
hardships
and
perils
they
had
shared
during
the
past
few
weeks
while
leading
the
expedition
in
the
retreat
to
the
southward
when
they
had
decided
upon
the
track
of
the
morrow
advance
they
sat
down
for
a
moment
upon
the
crest
of
a
hummock
to
breathe
themselves
their
elbows
on
their
knees
looking
off
to
the
south
over
the
desolation
of
broken
ice
with
his
one
good
hand
ferriss
drew
a
pipe
and
a
handful
of
tea
leaves
wrapped
in
oiled
paper
from
the
breast
of
his
parkie
do
you
mind
filling
this
pipe
for
me
ward
he
asked
of
bennett
bennett
glanced
at
the
tea
leaves
and
handed
them
back
to
ferriss
and
in
answer
to
his
remonstrance
produced
a
pouch
of
his
own
tobacco
cried
ferriss
astonished
why
i
thought
we
smoked
our
last
aboard
ship
no
i
saved
a
little
of
mine
oh
well
answered
ferriss
trying
to
interfere
with
bennett
who
was
filling
his
pipe
i
do
want
your
tobacco
this
tea
does
very
well
i
tell
you
i
have
of
a
kilo
left
lied
bennett
lighting
the
pipe
and
handing
it
back
to
him
whenever
you
want
a
smoke
you
can
set
to
me
bennett
lit
a
pipe
of
his
own
and
the
two
began
to
smoke
ah
murmured
ferriss
drawing
upon
the
pipe
ecstatically
i
thought
i
never
was
going
to
taste
good
weed
again
till
we
should
get
home
bennett
said
nothing
there
was
a
long
silence
home
what
did
not
that
word
mean
for
them
to
leave
all
this
hideous
grisly
waste
of
ice
behind
to
have
done
with
fighting
to
rest
to
forget
responsibility
to
have
no
more
anxiety
to
be
warm
once
more
warm
and
well
fed
and
dry
to
see
a
tree
again
to
rub
elbows
with
one
fellows
to
know
the
meaning
of
warm
handclasps
and
the
faces
of
one
friends
dick
began
bennett
abruptly
after
a
long
while
if
we
get
stuck
here
in
this
damned
ice
i
going
to
send
you
and
probably
metz
on
ahead
for
help
we
make
a
kyack
for
you
to
use
when
you
reach
the
limit
of
the
pack
but
besides
the
kyack
you
carry
nothing
but
your
provisions
and
rifle
and
travel
as
fast
as
you
can
bennett
paused
for
a
moment
then
in
a
different
voice
continued
i
wrote
a
letter
last
night
that
i
was
going
to
give
you
in
case
i
should
have
to
send
you
on
such
a
journey
but
i
think
i
might
as
well
give
it
to
you
now
he
drew
from
his
pocket
an
envelope
carefully
wrapped
in
oilskin
if
anything
should
happen
to
the
expedition
to
me
i
want
you
to
see
that
this
letter
is
delivered
he
paused
again
you
see
dick
it
like
this
there
a
girl
his
face
flamed
suddenly
no
no
a
woman
a
grand
noble
man
woman
back
in
country
who
is
a
great
deal
to
me
everything
in
fact
she
do
know
has
a
guess
that
i
care
i
never
spoke
to
her
about
it
but
if
anything
should
turn
up
i
should
want
her
to
know
how
it
had
been
with
me
how
much
she
was
to
me
so
i
written
her
you
see
that
she
gets
it
will
you
he
handed
the
little
package
to
ferriss
and
continued
indifferently
and
resuming
his
accustomed
manner
if
we
get
as
far
as
wrangel
island
you
can
give
it
back
to
me
we
are
bound
to
meet
the
relief
ships
or
the
steam
whalers
in
that
latitude
oh
you
can
look
at
the
address
added
bennett
as
ferriss
turning
the
envelope
bottom
side
up
was
thrusting
it
into
his
breast
pocket
you
know
her
even
better
than
i
do
it
lloyd
searight
ferriss
teeth
shut
suddenly
upon
his
pipestem
bennett
rose
tell
muck
tu
he
said
in
case
i
do
think
of
it
again
that
the
dogs
must
be
fed
from
now
on
from
those
that
die
i
shall
want
the
dog
biscuit
and
dried
fish
for
our
own
use
i
suppose
it
will
come
to
that
answered
ferriss
come
to
that
returned
bennett
grimly
i
hope
the
dogs
themselves
will
live
long
enough
for
us
to
eat
them
and
do
misunderstand
he
added
i
talk
about
our
getting
stuck
in
the
ice
about
my
not
pulling
through
it
only
because
one
must
foresee
everything
be
prepared
for
everything
remember
i
shall
pull
through
but
that
night
long
after
the
rest
were
sleeping
ferriss
who
had
not
closed
his
eyes
bestirred
himself
and
as
quietly
as
possible
crawled
from
his
he
fancied
there
was
some
slight
change
in
the
atmosphere
and
wanted
to
read
the
barometer
affixed
to
a
stake
just
outside
the
tent
yet
when
he
had
noted
that
it
was
after
all
stationary
he
stood
for
a
moment
looking
out
across
the
ice
with
unseeing
eyes
then
from
a
pocket
in
his
furs
he
drew
a
little
folder
of
morocco
it
was
pitiably
worn
stained
with
patched
and
repatched
its
frayed
edges
sewed
together
again
with
ravellings
of
cloth
and
loosening
with
his
teeth
the
thong
of
with
which
it
was
tied
ferriss
opened
it
and
held
it
to
the
faint
light
of
an
aurora
just
paling
in
the
northern
sky
so
he
muttered
after
a
while
so
bennett
too
for
a
long
time
ferriss
stood
looking
at
lloyd
picture
till
the
purple
streamers
in
the
north
faded
into
the
cold
gray
of
the
heavens
then
he
shot
a
glance
above
him
god
almighty
bless
her
and
keep
her
he
prayed
far
off
miles
away
an
split
with
the
prolonged
reverberation
of
thunder
the
aurora
was
gone
ferriss
returned
to
the
tent
the
following
week
the
expedition
suffered
miserably
snowstorm
followed
snowstorm
the
temperature
dropped
to
degrees
below
the
and
gales
of
wind
from
the
east
whipped
and
scourged
the
struggling
men
incessantly
with
myriad
lashes
at
night
the
agony
in
their
feet
was
all
but
unbearable
it
was
impossible
to
be
warm
impossible
to
be
dry
dennison
in
a
measure
recovered
his
health
but
the
ulcer
on
mcpherson
foot
had
so
eaten
the
flesh
that
the
muscles
were
visible
hawes
monotonous
chatter
and
crazy
whimperings
filled
the
tent
every
night
the
only
pleasures
left
them
the
only
breaks
in
the
monotony
of
that
life
were
to
eat
and
when
possible
to
sleep
thought
reason
and
reflection
dwindled
in
their
brains
instincts
the
primitive
elemental
impulses
of
the
animal
possessed
them
instead
to
eat
to
sleep
to
be
warm
they
asked
nothing
better
the
night
supper
was
a
vision
that
dwelt
in
their
imaginations
hour
after
hour
throughout
the
entire
day
oh
to
sit
about
the
blue
flame
of
alcohol
sputtering
underneath
the
old
and
battered
cooker
of
to
smell
the
delicious
savour
of
the
thick
boiling
soup
and
then
the
meal
itself
to
taste
the
hot
coarse
meaty
food
to
feel
that
unspeakably
grateful
warmth
and
glow
that
almost
divine
sensation
of
satiety
spreading
through
their
poor
shivering
bodies
and
then
sleep
sleep
though
quivering
with
cold
sleep
though
the
wet
searched
the
flesh
to
the
very
marrow
sleep
though
the
feet
burned
and
crisped
with
torture
sleep
sleep
the
dreamless
stupefaction
of
exhaustion
the
few
hours
oblivion
the
short
armistice
from
pain
but
stronger
more
insistent
than
even
these
instincts
of
the
animal
was
the
blind
unreasoned
impulse
that
set
their
faces
to
the
southward
to
get
forward
to
get
forward
answering
the
resistless
influence
of
their
leader
that
indomitable
man
of
iron
whom
no
fortune
could
break
nor
bend
and
who
imposed
his
will
upon
them
as
it
were
a
yoke
of
steel
this
idea
became
for
them
a
sort
of
obsession
forward
if
it
were
only
a
yard
if
it
were
only
a
foot
forward
over
the
rubble
ice
forward
against
the
biting
shrieking
wind
forward
in
the
face
of
the
blinding
snow
forward
through
the
brittle
crusts
and
icy
water
forward
although
every
step
was
an
agony
though
the
cut
like
a
dull
knife
though
their
clothes
were
sheets
of
ice
blinded
panting
bruised
bleeding
and
exhausted
dogs
and
men
animals
all
the
expedition
struggled
forward
one
day
a
little
before
noon
while
lunch
was
being
cooked
the
sun
broke
through
the
clouds
and
for
upward
of
half
an
hour
the
was
one
blinding
diamond
glitter
bennett
ran
for
his
sextant
and
got
an
observation
the
first
that
had
been
possible
for
nearly
a
month
he
worked
out
their
latitude
that
same
evening
the
next
morning
ferriss
was
awakened
by
a
touch
on
his
shoulder
bennett
was
standing
over
him
come
outside
here
a
moment
said
bennett
in
a
low
voice
do
wake
the
men
did
you
get
our
latitude
asked
ferriss
as
the
two
came
out
of
the
tent
yes
that
what
i
want
to
tell
you
what
is
it
why
what
do
you
mean
asked
ferriss
quickly
just
this
that
the
we
on
is
drifting
faster
to
the
north
than
we
are
marching
to
the
south
we
are
farther
north
now
than
we
were
a
month
ago
for
all
our
marching
ii
by
eleven
at
night
the
gale
had
increased
to
such
an
extent
and
the
sea
had
begun
to
build
so
high
that
it
was
a
question
whether
or
not
the
whaleboat
would
ride
the
storm
bennett
finally
decided
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
reach
the
land
stretching
out
in
a
long
dark
blur
to
the
southwest
that
night
and
that
the
boat
must
run
before
the
wind
if
he
was
to
keep
her
afloat
the
number
two
cutter
with
ferriss
in
command
was
a
bad
sailer
and
had
fallen
astern
she
was
already
out
of
hailing
distance
but
bennett
who
was
at
the
tiller
in
the
instant
glance
that
he
dared
to
shoot
behind
him
saw
with
satisfaction
that
ferriss
had
followed
his
example
the
whaleboat
and
the
number
two
cutter
were
the
only
boats
now
left
to
the
expedition
the
third
boat
had
been
abandoned
long
before
they
had
reached
open
water
an
hour
later
adler
the
who
had
been
bailing
and
who
sat
facing
bennett
looked
back
through
the
storm
then
turning
to
bennett
said
beg
pardon
sir
i
think
they
are
signalling
us
bennett
did
not
answer
but
with
his
hand
gripping
the
tiller
kept
his
face
to
the
front
his
glance
alternating
between
the
heaving
prow
of
the
boat
and
the
huge
gray
billows
hissing
with
froth
careering
rapidly
alongside
to
pause
for
a
moment
to
vary
by
ever
so
little
from
the
course
of
the
storm
might
mean
the
drowning
of
them
all
after
a
few
moments
adler
spoke
again
touching
his
cap
i
sure
i
see
a
signal
sir
no
you
do
answered
bennett
beg
pardon
i
quite
sure
i
do
bennett
leaned
toward
him
the
cast
in
his
eyes
twinkling
with
a
wicked
light
the
furrow
between
the
eyebrows
deepening
i
tell
you
you
see
any
signal
do
you
understand
you
do
see
any
signal
until
i
choose
to
have
you
the
night
was
bitter
hard
for
the
occupants
of
the
whaleboat
in
their
weakened
condition
they
were
in
no
shape
to
fight
a
polar
hurricane
in
an
open
boat
for
three
weeks
they
had
not
known
the
meaning
of
full
rations
during
the
first
days
after
the
line
of
march
over
the
ice
had
been
abruptly
changed
to
the
west
in
the
hope
of
reaching
open
water
only
rations
had
been
issued
and
now
for
the
last
two
days
half
rations
had
been
their
portion
the
gnawing
of
hunger
had
begun
every
man
was
perceptibly
weaker
matters
were
getting
desperate
but
by
seven
the
next
morning
the
storm
had
blown
itself
out
to
bennett
inexpressible
relief
the
cutter
hove
in
view
shaping
their
course
to
landward
once
more
the
boats
kept
company
and
by
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
bennett
and
the
crew
of
the
whaleboat
successfully
landed
upon
a
bleak
desolate
and
coast
but
in
some
way
never
afterward
sufficiently
explained
the
cutter
under
command
was
crushed
in
the
floating
ice
within
one
hundred
yards
of
the
shore
the
men
and
stores
were
landed
the
water
being
shallow
enough
for
wading
but
the
boat
was
a
hopeless
wreck
i
believe
it
cape
shelaski
said
bennett
to
ferriss
when
camp
had
been
made
and
their
maps
consulted
but
if
it
is
it
charted
minutes
too
far
to
the
west
before
breaking
camp
the
next
morning
bennett
left
this
record
under
a
cairn
of
rocks
upon
the
highest
point
of
the
cape
further
marking
the
spot
by
one
of
the

flags
the
freja
arctic
exploring
expedition
landed
at
this
point
october
our
ship
was
nipped
and
sunk
in
deg
min
north
latitude
on
the
of
july
last
i
then
attempted
a
southerly
march
to
wrangel
island
but
found
such
a
course
impracticable
on
account
of
northerly
drift
of
ice
on
the
lst
of
october
i
accordingly
struck
off
to
the
westward
to
find
open
water
at
the
limit
of
the
ice
being
compelled
to
abandon
one
boat
and
two
sledges
on
the
way
a
second
boat
was
crushed
beyond
repair
in
drifting
ice
while
attempting
a
landing
at
this
place
our
one
remaining
boat
being
too
small
to
accommodate
the
members
of
the
expedition
circumstances
oblige
me
to
begin
an
overland
march
toward
kolyuchin
bay
following
the
line
of
the
coast
we
expect
either
to
winter
among
the
chuckch
settlements
mentioned
by
nordenskjold
as
existing
upon
the
eastern
shores
of
kolyuchin
bay
or
to
fall
in
with
the
relief
ships
or
the
steam
whalers
en
route
by
issuing
half
rations
i
have
enough
provisions
for
eighteen
days
and
have
saved
all

and
lack

food
signed
ward
bennett
commanding
but
during
the
night
their
first
night
on
land
bennett
resolved
upon
a
desperate
expedient
not
only
the
boat
was
to
be
abandoned
but
also
the
sledges
and
not
only
the
sledges
but
every
article
of
weight
not
absolutely
necessary
to
the
existence
of
the
party
two
weeks
before
the
sun
had
set
not
to
rise
again
for
six
months
winter
was
upon
them
and
darkness
the
enemy
was
drawing
near
the
great
remorseless
grip
of
the
ice
was
closing
it
was
no
time
for
and
hesitation
now
it
was
life
or
death
the
sense
of
their
peril
the
nearness
of
the
enemy
strung
nerves
taut
as
his
will
hardened
to
the
flinty
hardness
of
the
ice
itself
his
strength
of
mind
and
of
body
seemed
suddenly
to
quadruple
itself
his
determination
was
that
of
the
blind
deaf
resistless
the
ugly
set
of
his
face
became
all
the
more
ugly
the
contorted
eyes
flashing
the
great
jaw
all
but
simian
he
appeared
physically
larger
it
was
no
longer
a
man
it
was
a
giant
an
ogre
a
colossal
jotun
hurling
fighting
out
a
battle
unspeakable
in
the
dawn
of
the
world
in
chaos
and
in
darkness
the
impedimenta
of
the
expedition
were
broken
up
into
packs
that
each
man
carried
upon
his
shoulders
from
now
on
everything
that
hindered
the
rapidity
of
their
movements
must
be
left
behind
six
dogs
all
that
remained
of
the
pack
of
eighteen
still
accompanied
them
bennett
had
hoped
and
had
counted
upon
his
men
for
an
average
daily
march
of
sixteen
miles
but
the
winter
gales
driving
down
from
the
northeast
beat
them
back
the
ice
and
snow
that
covered
the
land
were
no
less
uneven
than
the
hummocks
of
the
pack
all
game
had
migrated
far
to
the
southward
every
day
the
men
grew
weaker
and
weaker
their
provisions
dwindled
again
and
again
one
or
another
of
them
worn
out
beyond
human
endurance
would
go
to
sleep
while
marching
and
would
fall
to
the
ground
upon
the
third
day
of
this
overland
march
one
of
the
dogs
suddenly
collapsed
upon
the
ground
exhausted
and
dying
bennett
had
ordered
such
of
the
dogs
that
gave
out
cut
up
and
their
meat
added
to
the
store
of
the
party
provisions
ferriss
and
muck
tu
had
started
to
pick
up
the
dead
dog
when
the
other
dogs
famished
and
savage
sprang
upon
their
fallen
mate
the
two
men
struck
and
kicked
all
to
no
purpose
the
dogs
turned
upon
them
snarling
and
snapping
they
too
demanded
to
live
they
too
wanted
to
be
fed
it
was
a
hideous
business
there
in
that
of
the
polar
circle
lost
and
forgotten
on
a
primordial
shore
back
into
the
stone
age
once
more
men
and
animals
fought
one
another
for
the
privilege
of
eating
a
dead
dog
but
their
life
was
not
all
inhuman
bennett
at
least
could
rise
even
above
humanity
though
his
men
must
perforce
be
dragged
so
far
below
it
at
the
end
of
the
first
week
hawes
the
carpenter
died
when
they
awoke
in
the
morning
he
was
found
motionless
and
stiff
in
his
some
sort
of
grave
was
dug
the
poor
racked
body
lowered
into
it
and
before
it
was
filled
with
snow
and
broken
ice
bennett
standing
quietly
in
the
midst
of
the
group
opened
his
and
began
with
the
tremendous
words
i
am
the
resurrection
and
the
life
it
was
the
beginning
of
the
end
a
week
later
the
actual
starvation
began
slower
and
slower
moved
the
expedition
on
its
daily
march
faltering
staggering
blinded
and
buffeted
by
the
incessant
northeast
winds
cruel
merciless
keen
as
hope
long
since
was
dead
resolve
wore
thin
under
friction
of
disaster
like
a
rat
hunger
gnawed
at
them
hour
after
hour
the
cold
was
one
unending
agony
still
bennett
was
unbroken
still
he
urged
them
forward
for
so
long
as
they
could
move
he
would
drive
them
on
toward
four
on
the
afternoon
of
one
particularly
hard
day
word
was
passed
forward
to
bennett
at
the
head
of
the
line
that
something
was
wrong
in
the
rear
it
adler
he
down
again
and
ca
get
up
asks
you
to
leave
him
bennett
halted
the
line
and
went
back
some
little
distance
to
find
adler
lying
prone
upon
his
back
his
eyes
half
closed
breathing
short
and
fast
he
shook
him
roughly
by
the
shoulder
up
with
you
adler
opened
his
eyes
and
shook
his
head
i
i
done
for
this
time
sir
just
leave
me
here
please
shouted
bennett
you
not
done
for
i
know
better
really
sir
i
i
if
you
would
only
please
for
god
sake
sir
it
more
than
i
made
for
bennett
kicked
him
in
the
side
with
you
adler
struggled
to
his
feet
again
bennett
aiding
him
now
then
can
you
go
five
yards
i
think
i
do
know
perhaps
go
them
then
the
other
moved
forward
can
you
go
five
more
answer
speak
up
can
you
adler
nodded
his
head
go
them
and
another
five
and
another
there
that
something
like
a
man
and
let
have
no
more
woman
drivel
about
dying
but
bennett
came
close
to
him
shaking
a
forefinger
in
his
face
thrusting
forward
his
chin
wickedly
my
friend
i
drive
you
like
a
dog
but
his
fist
clenched
in
the
man
face
i
you
pull
through
two
hours
later
adler
finished
the
day
march
at
the
head
of
the
line
the
expedition
began
to
eat
its
dogs
every
evening
bennett
sent
muck
tu
and
adler
down
to
the
shore
to
gather
shrimps
though
fifteen
hundred
of
these
shrimps
hardly
filled
a
gill
measure
the
party
chewed
growing
in
scant
patches
in
the
rocks
and
at
times
made
a
thin
sickly
infusion
from
the
arctic
willow
again
and
again
bennett
despatched
the
esquimau
and
clarke
the
best
shots
in
the
party
on
hunting
expeditions
to
the
southward
invariably
they
returned
occasionally
they
reported
old
tracks
of
reindeer
and
foxes
but
the
winter
colds
had
driven
everything
far
inland
once
only
clarke
shot
a
a
little
bird
hardly
bigger
than
a
sparrow
still
bennett
pushed
forward
one
morning
in
the
beginning
of
the
third
week
after
a
breakfast
of
two
ounces
of
dog
meat
and
a
half
cup
of
willow
tea
ferriss
and
bennett
found
themselves
a
little
apart
from
the
others
the
men
were
engaged
in
lowering
the
tent
ferriss
glanced
behind
to
be
assured
he
was
out
of
hearing
then
how
about
mcpherson
he
said
in
a
low
voice
mcpherson
foot
was
all
but
eaten
to
the
bone
by
now
it
was
a
miracle
how
the
man
had
kept
up
thus
far
but
at
length
he
had
begun
to
fall
behind
every
day
he
straggled
more
and
more
and
the
previous
evening
had
reached
camp
nearly
an
hour
after
the
tent
had
been
pitched
but
he
was
a
plucky
fellow
of
sterner
stuff
than
the
adler
and
had
no
thought
of
giving
up
bennett
made
no
reply
to
ferriss
and
the
chief
engineer
did
not
repeat
the
question
the
day
march
began
almost
at
once
snowdrifts
were
encountered
and
when
these
had
been
left
behind
the
expedition
involved
itself
upon
the
precipitate
slopes
of
a
huge
talus
of
ice
and
bare
black
slabs
of
basalt
fully
two
hours
were
spent
in
clambering
over
this
obstacle
and
on
its
top
bennett
halted
to
breathe
the
men
but
when
they
started
forward
again
it
was
found
that
mcpherson
could
not
keep
his
feet
when
he
had
fallen
adler
and
dennison
had
endeavoured
to
lift
him
but
they
themselves
were
so
weak
that
they
too
fell
dennison
could
not
rise
of
his
own
efforts
and
instead
of
helping
mcpherson
had
to
be
aided
himself
bennett
came
forward
put
an
arm
about
mcpherson
and
hauled
him
to
an
upright
position
the
man
took
a
step
forward
but
his
left
foot
immediately
doubled
under
him
and
he
came
to
the
ground
again
three
times
this
manoeuvre
was
repeated
so
far
from
marching
mcpherson
could
not
even
stand
if
i
could
have
a
day
rest
began
mcpherson
unsteadily
bennett
cast
a
glance
at
dennison
the
doctor
dennison
shook
his
head
the
foot
the
entire
leg
below
the
knee
should
have
been
amputated
days
ago
a
month
rest
even
in
a
hospital
at
home
would
have
benefited
mcpherson
nothing
for
the
fraction
of
a
minute
bennett
debated
the
question
then
he
turned
to
the
command
forward
men
what
wh
began
mcpherson
sitting
upon
the
ground
looking
from
one
face
to
another
bewildered
terrified
some
of
the
men
began
to
move
off
wait
wait
exclaimed
the
cripple
i
i
can
get
along
i
he
rose
to
his
knees
made
a
great
effort
to
regain
his
footing
and
once
more
came
crashing
down
upon
the
ice
forward
but
but
but
you
not
going
to
leave
me
forward
he
been
my
chum
sir
all
through
the
voyage
said
one
of
the
men
touching
his
cap
to
bennett
i
had
just
as
soon
be
left
with
him
about
done
myself
another
joined
in
i
stay
too
i
ca
leave
it
it
too
terrible
there
was
a
moment
hesitation
those
who
had
begun
to
move
on
halted
the
whole
expedition
wavered
bennett
caught
the
from
muck
tu
hand
his
voice
rang
like
the
alarm
of
a
trumpet
forward
once
more
bennett
discipline
prevailed
his
iron
hand
shut
down
upon
his
men
more
than
ever
resistless
obediently
they
turned
their
faces
to
the
southward
the
march
was
resumed
another
day
passed
then
two
still
the
expedition
struggled
on
with
every
hour
their
sufferings
increased
it
did
not
seem
that
anything
human
could
endure
such
stress
and
yet
survive
toward
three
in
the
morning
of
the
third
night
adler
woke
bennett
it
clarke
sir
he
and
i
sleep
in
the
same
bag
i
think
he
going
sir
one
by
one
the
men
in
the
tent
were
awakened
and
the
lamp
was
lit
clarke
lay
in
his
unconscious
and
at
long
intervals
drawing
a
faint
quick
breath
the
doctor
bent
over
him
feeling
his
pulse
but
shook
his
head
hopelessly
he
dying
quietly
exhaustion
from
starvation
a
few
moments
later
clarke
began
to
tremble
slightly
the
mouth
opened
wide
a
faint
rattle
came
from
the
throat
four
miles
was
as
much
as
could
be
made
good
the
next
day
and
this
though
the
ground
was
comparatively
smooth
ferriss
was
continually
falling
dennison
and
metz
were
a
little
and
bennett
at
one
time
wondered
if
ferriss
himself
had
absolute
control
of
his
wits
since
morning
the
wind
had
been
blowing
strongly
in
their
faces
by
noon
it
had
increased
at
four
a
violent
gale
was
howling
over
the
reaches
of
ice
and
land
it
was
impossible
to
go
forward
while
it
lasted
the
stronger
gusts
fairly
carried
their
feet
from
under
them
at
four
the
party
halted
the
gale
was
now
a
hurricane
the
expedition
paused
collected
itself
went
forward
halted
again
again
attempted
to
move
and
came
at
last
to
a
definite
standstill
in
whirling
and
blinding
stupefying
blasts
pitch
the
tent
said
bennett
quietly
we
must
wait
now
till
it
blows
over
in
the
lee
of
a
mound
of
rock
some
hundred
yards
from
the
coast
the
tent
was
pitched
and
supper
such
as
it
was
eaten
in
silence
all
knew
what
this
enforced
halt
must
mean
for
them
that
supper
each
man
could
hold
his
portion
in
the
hollow
of
one
hand
was
the
last
of
their
regular
provisions
march
they
could
not
what
now
before
crawling
into
their
and
at
bennett
request
all
joined
in
repeating
the
creed
and
the
lord
prayer
the
next
day
passed
and
the
next
and
the
next
the
gale
continued
steadily
the
southerly
march
was
discontinued
all
day
and
all
night
the
men
kept
in
the
tent
huddled
in
the
sometimes
sleeping
eighteen
and
twenty
hours
out
of
the
they
lost
all
consciousness
of
the
lapse
of
time
sensation
even
of
suffering
left
them
the
very
hunger
itself
had
ceased
to
gnaw
only
bennett
and
ferriss
seemed
to
keep
their
heads
then
slowly
the
end
began
for
that
last
week
bennett

in
his

this

between

and

too
weak
to

out

tent
he
must
lie
where
he
is
divine
services
at
last
spoonful
of
glycerine
and
hot
water
the
next
day
was
monday
and
at
some
indeterminate
hour
of
the
though
whether
it
was
night
or
noon
he
could
not
say
ferriss
woke
in
his
and
raised
himself
on
an
elbow
and
for
a
moment
sat
stupidly
watching
bennett
writing
in
his
journal
noticing
that
he
was
awake
bennett
looked
up
from
the
page
and
spoke
in
a
voice
thick
and
muffled
because
of
the
swelling
of
his
tongue
how
long
has
this
wind
been
blowing
ferriss
since
a
week
ago
answered
the
other
bennett
continued
his
writing
incessant
gales
of
wind
for
over
a
week
impossible
to
move
against
them
in
our
weakened
condition
but
to
stay
here
is
to
perish
god
help
us
it
is
the
end
of
everything
bennett
drew
a
line
across
the
page
under
the
last
entry
and
still
holding
the
book
in
his
hand
gazed
slowly
about
the
tent
there
were
six
of
them
left
five
huddled
together
in
that
miserable
tent
the
sixth
adler
being
down
on
the
shore
gathering
shrimps
in
the
strange
and
gloomy
that
filled
the
tent
these
survivors
of
the
freja
looked
less
like
men
than
beasts
their
hair
and
beards
were
long
and
seemed
one
with
the
fur
covering
of
their
bodies
their
faces
were
absolutely
black
with
dirt
and
their
limbs
were
monstrously
distended
and
fat
fat
as
things
bloated
and
swollen
are
fat
it
was
the
abnormal
fatness
of
starvation
the
irony
of
misery
the
huge
joke
that
arctic
famine
plays
upon
those
whom
it
afterward
destroys
the
men
moved
about
at
times
on
their
hands
and
knees
their
tongues
were
distended
round
and
like
the
tongues
of
parrots
and
when
they
spoke
they
bit
them
helplessly
near
the
flap
of
the
tent
lay
the
swollen
dead
body
of
dennison
two
of
the
party
dozed
inert
and
stupefied
in
their
muck
tu
was
in
the
corner
of
the
tent
boiling
his
sealskin
footnips
over
the
cooker
ferriss
and
bennett
sat
on
opposite
sides
of
the
tent
bennett
using
his
knee
as
a
desk
ferriss
trying
to
free
himself
from
the
with
the
stumps
of
his
arms
upon
one
of
these
stumps
the
right
one
a
tin
spoon
had
been
lashed
the
tent
was
full
of
foul
smells
the
smell
of
drugs
and
of
mouldy
gunpowder
the
smell
of
dirty
rags
of
unwashed
bodies
the
smell
of
stale
smoke
of
scorching
sealskin
of
soaked
and
rotting
canvas
that
exhaled
from
the
tent
cover
every
smell
but
that
of
food
outside
the
unleashed
wind
yelled
incessantly
like
a
sabbath
of
witches
and
spun
about
the
pitiful
shelter
and
went
rioting
past
leaping
and
somersaulting
from
rock
to
rock
tossing
handfuls
of
dry
snow
into
the
air
insensate
an
enormous
mad
monster
gambolling
there
in
some
hideous
dance
of
death
capricious
headstrong
pitiless
as
a
famished
wolf
in
front
of
the
tent
and
over
a
ridge
of
barren
rocks
was
an
arm
of
the
sea
dotted
with
blocks
of
ice
moving
silently
and
swiftly
onward
while
back
from
the
coast
and
back
from
the
tent
and
to
the
south
and
to
the
west
and
to
the
east
stretched
the
illimitable
waste
of
land
rugged
gray
harsh
snow
and
ice
and
rock
rock
and
ice
and
snow
stretching
away
there
under
the
sombre
sky
forever
and
forever
gloomy
untamed
terrible
an
empty
region
the
scarred
battlefield
of
chaotic
forces
the
savage
desolation
of
a
prehistoric
world
where
adler
asked
ferriss
he
away
after
shrimps
responded
bennett
bennett
eyes
returned
to
his
journal
and
rested
on
the
open
page
thoughtfully
do
you
know
what
i
just
written
here
ferriss
he
asked
adding
without
waiting
for
an
answer
i
written
the
end
of
everything
i
suppose
it
is
admitted
ferriss
looking
about
the
tent
yes
the
end
of
everything
it
come
at
last
well
there
was
a
long
silence
one
of
the
men
in
the
groaned
and
turned
upon
his
face
outside
the
wind
lapsed
suddenly
to
a
prolonged
sigh
of
infinite
sadness
clamouring
again
upon
the
instant
dick
said
bennett
returning
his
journal
to
the
box
of
records
it
the
end
of
everything
and
just
because
it
is
i
want
to
talk
to
you
to
ask
you
something
ferriss
came
nearer
the
horrid
shouting
of
the
wind
deadened
the
sound
of
their
voices
the
others
could
not
hear
and
by
now
it
would
have
mattered
very
little
to
any
of
them
if
they
had
dick
began
bennett
nothing
makes
much
difference
now
in
a
few
hours
we
shall
all
be
like
dennison
here
he
tapped
the
body
of
the
doctor
who
had
died
during
the
night
it
was
already
frozen
so
hard
that
his
touch
upon
it
resounded
as
if
it
had
been
a
log
of
wood
we
shall
be
like
this
pretty
soon
but
before
well
while
i
can
i
want
to
ask
you
something
about
lloyd
searight
you
known
her
all
your
life
and
you
saw
her
later
than
i
did
before
we
left
you
remember
i
had
to
come
to
the
ship
two
days
before
you
about
the
bilge
pumps
while
bennett
had
been
speaking
ferriss
had
been
sitting
very
erect
upon
his
drawing
figures
and
vague
patterns
in
the
fur
of
his
coat
with
the
tip
of
the
tin
spoon
yes
bennett
was
right
he
ferriss
had
known
her
all
his
life
and
it
was
no
doubt
because
of
this
very
fact
that
she
had
come
to
be
so
dear
to
him
but
he
had
not
always
known
it
had
never
discovered
his
love
for
her
until
the
time
was
at
hand
to
say
to
leave
her
for
this
mad
dash
for
the
pole
it
had
been
too
late
to
speak
then
and
ferriss
had
never
told
her
she
was
never
to
know
that
he
too
like
bennett
cared
it
seems
rather
foolish
continued
bennett
clumsily
but
if
i
thought
she
had
ever
cared
for
me
in
that
way
why
it
would
make
this
that
is
coming
to
us
seem
i
do
know
easier
to
be
borne
perhaps
i
say
it
very
badly
but
it
would
not
be
so
hard
to
die
if
i
thought
she
had
ever
loved
me
a
bit
ferriss
was
thinking
very
fast
why
was
it
he
had
never
guessed
something
like
this
but
in
ferriss
mind
the
idea
of
the
love
of
a
woman
had
never
associated
itself
with
bennett
that
great
harsh
man
of
colossal
frame
so
absorbed
in
his
huge
projects
so
welded
to
his
single
aim
furthering
his
purposes
to
the
exclusion
of
every
other
thought
desire
or
emotion
bennett
was
a
man
man
but
here
ferriss
checked
himself
bennett
himself
had
called
her
a
man
woman
a
grand
splendid
man
woman
he
was
right
he
was
right
she
was
no
less
than
that
small
wonder
after
all
that
bennett
had
been
attracted
to
her
what
a
pair
they
were
strong
masterful
both
insolent
in
the
consciousness
of
their
power
you
have
known
her
so
well
and
for
so
long
continued
bennett
that
i
am
sure
she
must
have
said
something
to
you
about
me
tell
me
did
she
ever
say
anything
or
not
that
but
imply
in
her
manner
give
you
to
understand
that
she
would
have
married
me
if
i
had
asked
her
ferriss
found
time
even
in
such
an
hour
to
wonder
at
the
sudden
and
unexpected
break
in
the
uniform
hardness
of
bennett
character
ferriss
knew
him
well
by
now
bennett
was
not
a
man
to
ask
concessions
to
catch
at
small
favours
what
he
wanted
he
took
with
an
iron
hand
without
ruth
and
without
scruple
but
in
the
unspeakable
dissolution
in
which
they
were
now
involved
did
anything
make
a
difference
the
dreadful
mill
in
which
they
had
been
ground
had
crushed
from
them
all
petty
distinctions
of
personality
individuality
humanity
the
elements
of
character
common
to
all
men
only
remained
but
ferriss
was
puzzled
as
to
how
he
should
answer
bennett
on
the
one
hand
was
the
woman
he
loved
and
on
the
other
bennett
his
best
friend
his
chief
his
hero
they
too
had
lived
together
for
so
long
had
fought
out
the
fight
with
the
enemy
shoulder
to
shoulder
had
battled
with
the
same
dangers
had
dared
the
same
sufferings
had
undergone
the
same
defeats
and
disappointments
ferriss
felt
himself
in
grievous
straits
must
he
tell
bennett
the
truth
must
this
final
disillusion
be
added
to
that
long
train
of
others
the
disasters
the
failures
the
disappointments
and
deferred
hopes
of
all
those
past
months
must
bennett
die
hugging
to
his
heart
this
bitterness
as
well
i
sometimes
thought
observed
bennett
with
a
weak
smile
that
she
did
care
a
little
i
surely
seen
something
like
that
in
her
eyes
at
certain
moments
i
wish
i
had
spoken
did
she
ever
say
anything
to
you
do
you
think
she
would
have
married
me
if
i
had
asked
her
he
paused
waiting
for
an
answer
oh
yes
hazarded
ferriss
driven
to
make
some
sort
of
response
hoping
to
end
the
conversation
yes
i
think
she
would
you
do
said
bennett
quickly
you
think
she
would
what
did
she
say
did
she
ever
say
anything
to
you
the
thing
was
too
cruel
ferriss
shrank
from
it
but
suddenly
an
idea
occurred
to
him
did
anything
make
any
difference
now
why
not
tell
his
friend
that
which
he
wanted
to
hear
even
if
it
were
not
the
truth
after
all
that
bennett
had
suffered
why
could
he
not
die
content
at
least
in
this
what
did
it
matter
if
he
spoke
did
anything
matter
at
such
a
time
when
they
were
all
to
die
within
the
next
hours
bennett
was
looking
straight
into
his
eyes
there
was
no
time
to
think
of
consequences
consequences
but
there
were
to
be
consequences
this
was
the
end
yet
could
ferriss
make
bennett
receive
such
an
untruth
ferriss
did
not
believe
that
lloyd
cared
for
bennett
knew
that
she
did
not
in
fact
and
if
she
had
cared
did
bennett
think
for
an
instant
that
she
of
all
women
would
have
confessed
the
fact
confessed
it
to
him
bennett
most
intimate
friend
ferriss
had
known
lloyd
well
for
a
long
time
had
at
last
come
to
love
her
but
could
he
himself
tell
whether
or
no
lloyd
cared
for
him
no
he
could
not
certainly
he
could
not
meanwhile
bennett
was
waiting
for
his
answer
ferriss
mind
was
all
confused
he
could
no
longer
distinguish
right
from
wrong
if
the
lie
would
make
bennett
happier
in
this
last
hour
of
his
life
why
not
tell
the
lie
yes
answered
ferriss
she
did
say
something
once
she
did
yes
continued
ferriss
slowly
trying
to
invent
the
most
plausible
lie
we
had
been
speaking
of
the
expedition
and
of
you
i
do
know
how
the
subject
was
brought
up
but
it
came
in
very
naturally
at
length
she
said
yes
i
recall
it
she
said
must
bring
him
back
to
me
remember
he
is
everything
to
me
everything
in
the
world
she
bennett
cleared
his
throat
then
tugged
at
his
mustache
she
said
that
ferriss
nodded
ah
said
bennett
with
a
quick
breath
then
he
added
i
glad
of
that
you
have
any
idea
how
glad
i
am
dick
in
spite
of
everything
oh
yes
i
guess
i
have
murmured
ferriss
no
no
indeed
you
have
returned
the
other
one
has
to
love
a
woman
like
that
dick
and
have
her
and
find
out
and
have
things
come
right
to
appreciate
it
she
would
have
been
my
wife
after
all
i
know
how
to
thank
you
dick
congratulate
me
he
rose
holding
out
his
hand
ferriss
feebly
rose
too
and
instinctively
extended
his
arm
but
withdrew
it
suddenly
bennett
paused
abruptly
letting
his
hand
fall
to
his
side
and
the
two
men
remained
there
an
instant
looking
at
the
stumps
of
ferriss
arms
the
tin
spoon
still
lashed
to
the
right
wrist
a
few
hours
later
bennett
noted
that
the
gale
had
begun
perceptibly
to
abate
by
afternoon
he
was
sure
that
the
storm
would
be
over
as
he
turned
to
the
tent
after
reading
the
he
noted
that
kamiska
their
one
remaining
dog
had
come
back
and
was
sitting
on
a
projection
of
ice
a
little
distance
away
uncertain
as
to
her
reception
after
her
absence
bennett
was
persuaded
that
kamiska
had
not
run
away
of
all
the
ostiaks
she
had
been
the
most
faithful
bennett
chose
to
believe
that
she
had
wandered
from
the
tent
and
had
lost
herself
in
the
blinding
snow
but
here
was
food
kamiska
could
be
killed
life
could
be
prolonged
a
day
or
two
perhaps
three
while
the
strongest
man
of
the
party
carrying
the
greater
portion
of
the
dog
meat
on
his
shoulders
could
push
forward
and
perhaps
after
all
reach
kolyuchin
bay
and
the
chuckch
settlements
and
return
with
aid
but
who
could
go
assuredly
not
ferriss
so
weak
he
could
scarcely
keep
on
his
feet
not
adler
who
at
times
was
delirious
and
who
needed
the
discipline
of
a
powerful
leader
to
keep
him
to
his
work
muck
tu
the
esquimau
could
not
be
trusted
with
the
lives
of
all
of
them
and
the
two
remaining
men
were
in
all
but
a
dying
condition
only
one
man
of
them
all
was
equal
to
the
task
only
one
of
them
who
still
retained
his
strength
of
body
and
mind
he
himself
bennett
yes
but
to
abandon
his
men
he
crawled
into
the
tent
again
to
get
the
rifle
with
which
to
shoot
the
dog
but
suddenly
possessed
of
an
idea
paused
for
a
moment
seated
on
the
his
head
in
his
hands
beaten
was
he
beaten
at
last
had
the
enemy
conquered
had
the
ice
enclosed
him
in
its
vast
remorseless
grip
then
once
more
his
determination
grew
big
within
him
for
a
last
time
that
iron
will
rose
up
in
mighty
protest
of
defeat
no
no
no
he
was
not
beaten
he
would
live
he
the
strongest
the
fittest
would
survive
was
it
not
right
that
the
mightiest
should
live
was
it
not
the
great
law
of
nature
he
knew
himself
to
be
strong
enough
to
move
to
march
perhaps
for
two
whole
days
and
now
food
had
come
to
them
to
him
yes
but
to
abandon
his
men
he
had
left
mcpherson
it
is
true
but
then
the
lives
of
all
of
them
had
been
involved
one
life
against
eleven
now
he
was
thinking
only
of
himself
but
ferriss
no
he
could
not
leave
ferriss
ferriss
would
come
with
him
they
would
share
the
dog
meat
between
them
the
whole
of
it
he
with
ferriss
would
push
on
he
would
reach
kolyuchin
bay
and
the
settlements
he
would
be
saved
he
would
reach
home
would
come
back
come
back
to
lloyd
who
loved
him
yes
but
to
abandon
his
men
then
bennett
great
fist
closed
closed
and
smote
heavily
upon
his
knee
no
he
said
decisively
he
had
spoken
his
thoughts
aloud
and
ferriss
who
had
crawled
into
his
again
looked
at
him
curiously
even
muck
tu
turned
his
head
from
the
sickening
mess
reeking
upon
the
cooker
there
was
a
noise
of
feet
at
the
flap
of
the
tent
it
adler
muttered
ferriss
adler
tore
open
the
flap
then
he
shouted
to
bennett
three
steam
whalers
off
the
foot
of
the
floe
sir
boat
putting
off
what
orders
sir
bennett
looked
at
him
stupidly
as
yet
without
definite
thought
what
did
you
say
the
men
in
the
roused
by
adler
shout
sat
up
and
listened
stolidly
steam
whalers
said
bennett
slowly
where
i
guess
not
he
added
shaking
his
head
adler
was
swaying
in
his
place
with
excitement
three
whalers
he
repeated
close
in
they
put
off
oh
my
god
listen
to
that
the
unmistakable
sound
of
a
steamer
whistle
raucous
and
prolonged
came
to
their
ears
from
the
direction
of
the
coast
one
of
the
men
broke
into
a
feeble
cheer
the
whole
tent
was
rousing
up
again
and
again
came
the
hoarse
insistent
cry
of
the
whistle
what
orders
sir
repeated
adler
a
clamour
of
voices
filled
the
tent
ferriss
came
quickly
up
to
bennett
trying
to
make
himself
heard
listen
he
cried
with
eager
intentness
what
i
told
you
a
while
ago
about
lloyd
i
thought
it
all
a
mistake
you
do
understand
bennett
was
not
listening
what
orders
sir
exclaimed
adler
for
the
third
time
bennett
drew
himself
up
my
compliments
to
the
officer
in
command
tell
him
there
are
six
of
us
left
tell
him
oh
tell
him
anything
you
damn
please
men
he
cried
his
harsh
face
suddenly
radiant
make
ready
to
get
out
of
this
going
home
going
home
to
those
who
love
us
men
iii
as
lloyd
searight
turned
into
calumet
square
on
her
way
from
the
bookseller
with
her
purchases
under
her
arm
she
was
surprised
to
notice
a
drop
of
rain
upon
the
back
of
one
of
her
white
gloves
she
looked
up
quickly
the
sun
was
gone
on
the
east
side
of
the
square
under
the
trees
the
houses
that
at
this
hour
of
the
afternoon
should
have
been
overlaid
with
golden
light
were
in
shadow
the
heat
that
had
been
palpitating
through
all
the
city
streets
since
early
morning
was
swiftly
giving
place
to
a
certain
cool
and
odorous
dampness
there
was
even
a
breeze
beginning
to
stir
in
the
tops
of
the
higher
elms
as
the
drops
began
to
thicken
upon
the
warm
asphalt
under
foot
lloyd
sharply
quickened
her
pace
but
the
summer
storm
was
coming
up
rapidly
by
the
time
she
reached
the
great
agency
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
square
she
was
all
but
running
and
as
she
put
her
key
in
the
door
the
rain
swept
down
with
a
prolonged
and
muffled
roar
she
let
herself
into
the
spacious
airy
hallway
of
the
agency
shutting
the
door
by
leaning
against
it
and
stood
there
for
an
instant
to
get
her
breath
rownie
the
young
mulatto
girl
one
of
the
servants
of
the
house
who
was
going
upstairs
with
an
armful
of
clean
towels
turned
about
at
the
closing
of
the
door
and
called
jus
in
time
miss
lloyd

time

miss
lloyd
while
rownie
had
been
speaking
lloyd
had
crossed
the
hall
to
where
the
roster
of
the
nurses
names
in
little
movable
slides
hung
against
the
wall
as
often
as
a
nurse
was
called
out
she
removed
her
name
from
the
top
of
this
list
and
slid
it
into
place
at
the
bottom
so
that
whoever
found
her
name
at
the
top
of
the
roster
knew
that
she
was
next
on
call
and
prepared
herself
accordingly
lloyd
name
was
now
at
the
top
of
the
list
she
had
not
been
gone
five
minutes
from
the
agency
and
it
was
rare
for
two
nurses
to
be
called
out
in
so
short
a
time
is
it
your
asked
rownie
as
lloyd
faced
quickly
about
yes
yes
answered
lloyd
running
up
the
stairs
adding
as
she
passed
the
mulatto
there
been
no
call
sent
in
since
miss
thielman
left
has
there
rownie
rownie
shook
her
head
lloyd
went
directly
to
her
room
tossed
her
books
aside
without
removing
the
wrappers
and
set
about
packing
her
satchel
when
this
was
done
she
changed
her
street
dress
and
crisp
skirt
for
clothes
that
would
not
rustle
when
she
moved
and
put
herself
neatly
to
rights
stripping
off
her
rings
and
removing
the
from
her
waist
then
she
went
to
the
round
mirror
that
hung
between
the
windows
of
her
room
and
combed
back
her
hair
in
a
great
roll
from
her
forehead
and
temples
and
stood
there
a
moment
or
so
when
she
had
done
looking
at
her
reflection
she
was
tall
and
of
a
very
vigorous
build
with
large
strong
hands
and
solid
round
wrists
her
face
was
rather
serious
one
did
not
expect
her
to
smile
easily
the
eyes
dull
blue
with
no
trace
of
sparkle
and
set
deep
under
heavy
level
eyebrows
her
mouth
was
the
mouth
of
the
obstinate
of
the
and
her
chin
was
not
small
but
her
hair
was
a
veritable
glory
a
flame
that
bore
back
from
her
face
in
one
great
solid
roll
dull
red
like
copper
or
old
bronze
thick
heavy
almost
gorgeous
in
its
sombre
radiance
hair
eyes
and
a
faint
dull
glow
forever
on
her
cheeks
lloyd
was
a
beautiful
woman
much
about
her
that
was
regal
for
she
was
very
straight
as
well
as
very
tall
and
could
look
down
upon
most
women
and
upon
not
a
few
men
lloyd
turned
from
the
mirror
laying
down
the
comb
she
had
yet
to
pack
her
nurse
bag
or
since
this
was
always
ready
to
make
sure
that
none
of
its
equipment
was
lacking
she
was
very
proud
of
this
bag
as
she
had
caused
it
to
be
made
after
her
own
ideas
and
design
it
was
of
black
russia
leather
and
in
the
form
of
an
ordinary
valise
but
set
off
with
a
fine
silver
clasp
bearing
her
name
and
the
agency
address
she
brought
it
from
the
closet
and
ran
over
its
contents
murmuring
the
while
to
herself
clinical
thermometer
brandy
hypodermic
syringe
vial
of
crystals
temperature
charts
yes
yes
everything
right
while
she
was
still
speaking
miss
douglass
the
fever
nurse
knocked
at
her
door
and
finding
it
ajar
entered
without
further
ceremony
are
you
in
miss
searight
called
miss
douglass
looking
about
the
room
for
lloyd
had
returned
to
the
closet
and
was
busy
washing
the
yes
yes
cried
lloyd
i
am
sit
down
rownie
told
me
you
are
next
on
call
said
the
other
dropping
on
lloyd
couch
so
i
am
i
was
very
nearly
caught
too
i
ran
over
across
the
square
for
five
minutes
and
while
i
was
gone
miss
wakeley
and
esther
thielman
were
called
my
name
is
at
the
top
now
esther
got
a
typhoid
case
from
pitts
do
you
know
lloyd
that
let
me
see
that
four
seven
nine
that
ten
typhoid
cases
in
the
city
that
i
can
think
of
right
now
it
everywhere
yes
i
know
answered
lloyd
coming
out
of
the
room
carefully
drying
the
we
are
going
to
have
trouble
with
it
continued
the
fever
nurse
plenty
of
it
before
cool
weather
comes
it
almost
epidemic
lloyd
held
the
against
the
light
scrutinising
it
with
narrowed
lids
what
did
esther
say
when
she
knew
it
was
an
infectious
case
she
asked
did
she
hesitate
at
all
not
she
declared
miss
douglass
she
no
harriet
freeze
lloyd
did
not
answer
this
case
of
harriet
freeze
was
one
that
the
nurses
of
the
house
had
never
forgotten
and
would
never
forgive
miss
freeze
a
young
english
woman
newly
graduated
suddenly
called
upon
to
nurse
a
patient
stricken
with
smallpox
had
flinched
and
had
been
found
wanting
at
the
crucial
moment
had
discovered
an
excuse
for
leaving
her
post
having
once
accepted
it
it
was
cowardice
in
the
presence
of
the
enemy
anything
could
have
been
forgiven
but
that
on
the
girl
return
to
the
agency
nothing
was
said
no
action
taken
but
for
all
that
she
was
none
the
less
expelled
dishonourably
from
the
midst
of
her
companions
nothing
could
have
been
stronger
than
the
de
of
this
group
of
young
women
whose
lives
were
devoted
to
an
unending
battle
with
disease
lloyd
continued
the
overhauling
of
her
equipment
and
began
ruling
forms
for
nourishment
charts
while
miss
douglass
importuned
her
to
subscribe
to
a
purse
the
nurses
were
making
up
for
an
old
cripple
dying
of
cancer
lloyd
refused
you
know
very
well
miss
douglass
that
i
only
give
to
charity
through
the
association
i
know
persisted
the
other
and
i
know
you
give
twice
as
much
as
all
of
us
put
together
but
with
this
poor
old
fellow
it
different
we
know
all
about
him
and
every
one
of
us
in
the
house
has
given
something
you
are
the
only
one
that
wo
lloyd
and
i
had
so
hoped
i
could
make
it
tip
to
fifty
dollars
no
we
need
only
three
dollars
now
we
can
buy
that
little
cigar
stand
for
him
for
fifty
dollars
no
and
you
wo
give
us
just
three
dollars
no
well
you
give
half
and
i
give
half
said
miss
douglass
do
you
think
it
a
question
of
money
with
me
lloyd
smiled
indeed
this
was
a
poor
argument
with
which
to
move
lloyd
lloyd
whose
railroad
stock
alone
brought
her
some
fifteen
thousand
dollars
a
year
well
no
i
do
mean
that
of
course
but
lloyd
do
let
us
have
three
dollars
and
i
can
send
word
to
the
old
chap
this
very
afternoon
it
will
make
him
happy
for
the
rest
of
his
life
no
no
no
not
three
dollars
nor
three
cents
miss
douglass
made
a
gesture
of
despair
she
might
have
expected
that
she
could
not
move
lloyd
once
her
mind
was
made
up
one
might
argue
with
her
till
one
breath
failed
she
shook
her
head
at
lloyd
and
exclaimed
but
not
obstinate
obstinate
obstinate
lloyd
put
away
the
hypodermic
syringe
and
the
in
their
places
in
the
bag
added
a
little
to
its
contents
and
shut
the
bag
with
a
snap
now
she
announced
i
ready
when
miss
douglass
had
taken
herself
away
lloyd
settled
herself
in
the
place
she
had
vacated
and
stripping
the
wrappings
from
the
books
and
magazines
she
had
bought
began
to
turn
the
pages
looking
at
the
pictures
but
her
interest
flagged
she
tried
to
read
but
soon
cast
the
book
from
her
and
leaned
back
upon
the
great
couch
her
hands
clasped
behind
the
great
coils
at
the
back
of
her
head
her
eyes
fixed
and
vacant
for
hours
the
preceding
night
she
had
lain
broad
awake
in
her
bed
staring
at
the
shifting
shadow
pictures
that
the
electric
lights
shining
through
the
trees
down
in
the
square
threw
upon
the
walls
and
ceiling
of
her
room
she
had
eaten
but
little
since
morning
a
growing
spirit
of
unrest
had
possessed
her
for
the
last
two
days
now
it
had
reached
a
head
she
could
no
longer
put
her
thoughts
from
her
it
had
all
come
back
again
for
the
fiftieth
time
for
the
hundredth
time
the
old
intolerable
burden
of
anxiety
growing
heavier
month
by
month
year
by
year
it
seemed
to
her
that
a
shape
of
terror
formless
intangible
and
invisible
was
always
by
her
now
withdrawing
now
advancing
but
always
there
there
close
at
hand
in
some
dark
corner
where
she
could
not
see
ready
at
every
instant
to
assume
a
terrible
and
all
too
form
and
to
jump
at
her
from
behind
from
out
the
dark
and
to
clutch
her
throat
with
cold
fingers
the
thing
played
with
her
tormented
her
at
times
it
all
but
disappeared
at
times
she
believed
she
had
fought
it
from
her
for
good
and
then
she
would
wake
of
a
night
in
the
stillness
and
in
the
dark
and
know
it
to
be
there
once
more
at
her
bedside
at
her
back
at
her
throat
till
her
heart
went
wild
with
fear
and
the
suspense
of
waiting
for
an
enemy
that
would
not
strike
but
that
lurked
and
leered
in
dark
corners
wrung
from
her
a
suppressed
cry
of
anguish
and
exasperation
and
drove
her
from
her
sleep
with
streaming
eyes
and
hands
and
wordless
prayers
for
a
few
moments
lloyd
lay
back
upon
the
couch
then
regained
her
feet
with
a
brusque
harassed
movement
of
head
and
shoulders
ah
no
she
exclaimed
under
her
breath
it
is
too
dreadful
she
tried
to
find
diversion
in
her
room
rearranging
the
few
ornaments
winding
the
clock
that
struck
ships
bells
instead
of
hours
and
turning
the
wicks
of
the
old
empire
lamps
that
hung
in
brass
brackets
on
either
side
the
fireplace
lloyd
after
building
the
agency
had
felt
no
scruple
in
choosing
the
best
room
in
the
house
and
furnishing
it
according
to
her
taste
her
room
was
beautiful
but
very
simple
in
its
appointments
there
were
great
flat
unspoiled
by
the
floor
marquetry
with
but
few
rugs
the
fireplace
and
its
appurtenances
were
of
brass
her
a
huge
affair
of
ancient
and
almost
black
san
domingo
mahogany
but
soon
she
wearied
of
the
small
business
of
pottering
about
her
clock
and
lamps
and
turning
to
the
window
opened
it
and
leaning
upon
her
elbows
looked
down
into
the
square
by
now
the
thunderstorm
was
gone
like
the
withdrawal
of
a
dark
curtain
the
sun
was
out
again
over
the
city
the
square
deserted
but
half
an
hour
ago
was
reinvaded
with
its
little
people
of
policemen
and
loungers
reading
their
papers
on
the
benches
near
the
fountain
the
elms
still
dripped
their
wet
leaves
glistening
again
to
the
sun
there
was
a
delicious
smell
in
the
air
a
smell
of
warm
wet
grass
of
leaves
and
drenched
bark
from
the
trees
on
the
far
side
of
the
square
seen
at
intervals
in
the
spaces
between
the
foliage
a
passing
truck
painted
vermilion
set
a
brisk
note
of
colour
in
the
scene
a
newsboy
appeared
chanting
the
evening
editions
on
a
sudden
and
from
somewhere
close
at
hand
an
unseen
broke
out
into
a
gay
jangling
quickstep
marking
the
time
with
delightful
precision
a
carriage
its
fine
lacquered
flanks
gleaming
in
the
sunlight
rolled
through
the
square
on
its
way
no
doubt
to
the
very
fashionable
quarter
of
the
city
just
beyond
lloyd
had
a
glimpse
of
the
girl
leaning
back
in
its
cushions
a
girl
of
her
own
age
with
whom
she
had
some
slight
acquaintance
for
a
moment
lloyd
ridden
with
her
terrors
asked
herself
if
this
girl
with
no
capabilities
for
either
great
happiness
or
great
sorrow
were
not
perhaps
after
all
happier
than
she
but
she
recoiled
instantly
murmuring
to
herself
with
a
certain
fierce
energy
no
no
after
all
i
have
lived
and
how
had
she
lived
for
the
moment
lloyd
was
willing
to
compare
herself
with
the
girl
in
the
landau
swiftly
she
ran
over
her
own
life
from
the
time
when
left
an
orphan
in
the
year
of
her
majority
she
had
become
her
own
mistress
and
the
mistress
of
the
searight
estate
but
even
at
that
time
she
had
long
since
broken
away
from
the
conventional
world
she
had
known
lloyd
was
a
nurse
in
the
great
st
luke
hospital
even
then
had
been
a
probationer
there
at
the
time
of
her
death
six
months
before
she
had
always
been
ambitious
but
vaguely
so
having
no
determined
object
in
view
she
recalled
how
at
that
time
she
knew
only
that
she
was
in
love
with
her
work
her
chosen
profession
and
was
accounted
the
best
operating
nurse
in
the
ward
she
remembered
too
the
various
steps
of
her
advancement
the
positions
she
had
occupied
probationer
first
then
full
member
of
the
active
corps
next
operating
nurse
then
ward
manager
and
after
her
graduation
head
nurse
of
ward
four
where
the
maternity
cases
were
treated
then
had
come
the
time
when
she
had
left
the
hospital
and
practised
private
nursing
by
herself
and
at
last
not
so
long
ago
the
day
when
her
idea
had
so
abruptly
occurred
to
her
when
her
ambition
no
longer
vague
no
longer
personal
had
crystallised
and
taken
shape
when
she
had
discovered
a
use
for
her
money
and
had
built
and
founded
the
house
on
calumet
square
for
a
time
she
had
been
the
superintendent
of
nurses
here
until
her
own
theories
and
ideas
had
obtained
and
prevailed
in
its
management
then
her
work
fairly
started
she
had
resigned
her
position
to
an
older
woman
and
had
taken
her
place
in
the
rank
and
file
of
the
nurses
themselves
she
wished
to
be
one
of
them
living
the
same
life
subject
to
the
same
rigorous
discipline
and
to
that
end
she
had
never
allowed
it
to
be
known
that
she
was
the
founder
of
the
house
the
other
nurses
knew
that
she
was
very
rich
very
independent
and
but
that
was
all
lloyd
did
not
know
and
cared
very
little
how
they
explained
the
origin
and
support
of
the
agency
lloyd
was
animated
by
no
great
philanthropy
no
vast
love
of
humanity
in
her
work
only
she
wanted
with
all
her
soul
she
wanted
to
count
in
the
general
economy
of
things
to
choose
a
work
and
do
it
to
help
on
un
coup
and
this
supported
by
her
own
stubborn
energy
and
her
immense
wealth
she
felt
that
she
was
doing
to
do
things
had
become
her
creed
to
do
things
not
to
think
them
to
do
things
not
to
talk
them
to
do
things
not
to
read
them
no
matter
how
lofty
the
thoughts
how
brilliant
the
talk
how
beautiful
the
literature
for
her
first
last
and
always
were
acts
acts
acts
concrete
substantial
material
acts
the
greatest
and
happiest
day
of
her
life
had
been
when
at
last
she
laid
her
bare
hand
upon
the
rough
hard
stone
of
the
house
in
the
square
and
looked
up
at
the
facade
her
eyes
flashing
with
the
light
that
so
rarely
came
to
them
while
she
murmured
between
her
teeth
i
did
this
as
she
recalled
this
moment
now
leaning
upon
her
elbows
looking
down
upon
the
trees
and
grass
and
asphalt
of
the
square
and
upon
a
receding
landau
a
wave
of
a
certain
natural
pride
in
her
strength
the
satisfaction
of
attainment
came
to
her
ah
she
was
better
than
other
women
ah
she
was
stronger
than
other
women
she
was
carrying
out
a
splendid
work
she
straightened
herself
to
her
full
height
abruptly
stretching
her
outspread
hands
vaguely
to
the
sunlight
to
the
city
to
the
world
to
the
great
engine
of
life
whose
lever
she
could
grasp
and
could
control
smiling
proudly
almost
insolently
in
the
consciousness
of
her
strength
the
fine
steadfastness
of
her
purpose
then
all
at
once
the
smile
was
struck
from
her
lips
the
stiffness
of
her
poise
suddenly
relaxed
there
there
it
was
again
the
terror
the
dreadful
fear
she
dared
not
name
back
in
its
place
once
more
at
her
side
at
her
shoulder
at
her
throat
ready
to
clutch
at
her
from
out
the
dark
she
wheeled
from
the
window
from
the
sunlight
her
hands
clasped
before
her
trembling
lips
the
tears
brimming
her
eyes
for
hours
she
had
fought
this
from
her
but
now
it
was
no
longer
to
be
resisted
no
no
she
cried
half
aloud
i
am
no
better
no
stronger
than
the
others
what
does
it
all
amount
to
when
i
know
that
after
all
i
am
just
a
woman
just
a
woman
whose
heart
is
slowly
breaking
but
there
was
an
interruption
rownie
had
knocked
twice
at
her
door
before
lloyd
had
heard
her
when
lloyd
had
opened
the
door
the
girl
handed
her
a
card
with
an
address
written
on
it
in
the
hand
this
here
jus
now
come
in
street
miss
lloyd
said
rownie
miss
bergyn
this
was
the
superintendent
nurse
ast
me
to
give
it
to
you
it
was
a
call
to
an
address
that
seemed
familiar
to
lloyd
at
first
but
she
did
not
stop
at
that
moment
to
reflect
her
stable
telephone
hung
against
the
wall
of
the
closet
she
rang
for
lewis
and
while
waiting
for
him
to
get
around
dressed
for
the
street
for
the
moment
at
the
prospect
of
action
even
her
haunting
fear
drew
off
and
stood
away
from
her
she
was
absorbed
in
her
work
upon
the
instant
alert
watchful
what
the
case
was
she
could
only
surmise
how
long
she
would
be
away
she
had
no
means
of
knowing
a
week
a
month
a
year
she
could
not
tell
but
she
was
ready
for
any
contingency
usually
the
doctors
informed
the
nurses
as
to
the
nature
of
the
case
at
the
time
of
sending
for
them
but
street
had
not
done
so
now
however
rownie
called
up
to
her
that
her
coupé
was
at
the
door
lloyd
caught
up
her
satchels
and
ran
down
the
stairs
crying
to
miss
douglass
whom
she
saw
at
the
farther
end
of
the
hall
in
the
hallway
by
the
vestibule
she
changed
the
slide
bearing
her
name
from
the
top
to
the
bottom
of
the
roster
how
about
your
mail
cried
miss
douglass
after
her
keep
it
here
for
me
until
i
see
how
long
i
to
be
away
answered
lloyd
her
hand
upon
the
knob
i
let
you
know
lewis
had
put
rox
in
the
shafts
and
while
the
coupé
spun
over
the
asphalt
at
a
smart
clip
lloyd
tried
to
remember
where
she
had
heard
of
the
address
before
suddenly
she
snapped
her
fingers
she
knew
the
case
had
even
been
assigned
to
it
some
eight
months
before
yes
yes
that
it
campbell
wife
dead
lafayette

little
daughter
hattie
hip
disease
hopeless
poor
little
baby
arriving
at
the
house
lloyd
found
the
surgeon
street
and
campbell
who
was
a
widower
waiting
for
her
in
a
small
off
the
library
the
surgeon
was
genuinely
surprised
and
delighted
to
see
her
most
of
the
doctors
of
the
city
knew
lloyd
for
the
best
trained
nurse
in
the
hospitals
oh
it
you
miss
searight
good
enough
the
surgeon
introduced
her
to
the
little
patient
father
adding
if
any
one
can
pull
us
through
campbell
it
will
be
miss
searight
the
surgeon
and
nurse
began
to
discuss
the
case
i
think
you
know
it
already
do
you
miss
searight
said
the
surgeon
you
took
care
of
it
a
while
last
winter
well
there
was
a
little
improvement
in
the
spring
not
so
much
pain
but
that
in
itself
is
a
bad
sign
we
have
done
what
we
could
farnham
and
i
but
it
yield
to
treatment
you
know
how
these
things
are
stubborn
we
made
a
preliminary
examination
yesterday
sinuses
have
occurred
and
the
probe
leads
down
to
nothing
but
dead
bone
farnham
and
i
had
a
consultation
this
morning
we
must
play
our
last
card
i
shall
exsect
the
joint
campbell
drew
in
his
breath
and
held
it
for
a
moment
looking
out
of
the
window
very
attentive
lloyd
merely
nodded
her
head
murmuring
i
understand
when
street
had
gone
lloyd
immediately
set
to
work
the
operation
was
to
take
place
at
noon
the
following
day
and
she
foresaw
there
would
be
no
sleep
for
her
that
night
street
had
left
everything
to
her
even
to
the
sterilising
of
his
instruments
until
daylight
the
following
morning
lloyd
came
and
went
about
the
house
with
an
untiring
energy
yet
with
the
silence
of
a
swiftly
moving
shadow
getting
together
the
things
needed
for
the
operation
strychnia
tablets
absorbent
cotton
the
rubber
tubing
for
the
tourniquet
bandages
salt
and
the
like
and
preparing
the
little
chamber
adjoining
the
as
an
the
little
patient
herself
hattie
hardly
into
her
teens
remembered
lloyd
at
once
before
she
went
to
sleep
lloyd
contrived
to
spend
an
hour
in
the
with
her
told
her
as
much
as
was
necessary
of
what
was
contemplated
and
by
her
cheery
talk
her
gentleness
and
sympathy
inspired
the
little
girl
with
a
certain
sense
of
confidence
and
trust
in
her
but
but
but
just
how
bad
will
it
hurt
miss
searight
inquired
hattie
looking
at
her
and
serious
dear
it
wo
hurt
you
at
all
just
two
or
three
breaths
of
the
ether
and
you
will
be
sound
asleep
when
you
wake
up
it
will
be
all
over
and
you
will
be
well
lloyd
made
the
ether
cone
from
a
stiff
towel
and
set
it
on
last
of
all
and
just
before
the
operation
the
gauze
sponges
occupied
her
attention
the
daytime
brought
her
no
rest
hattie
was
not
to
have
any
breakfast
but
toward
the
middle
of
the
forenoon
lloyd
gave
her
a
stimulating
enema
of
whiskey
and
water
following
it
about
an
hour
later
by
a
hundredth
grain
of
atropia
she
braided
the
little
girl
hair
in
two
long
plaits
so
that
her
head
would
rest
squarely
and
flatly
upon
the
pillow
hattie
herself
was
now
ready
for
the
surgeon
now
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
done
lloyd
could
but
wait
she
took
her
place
at
the
bedside
and
tried
to
talk
as
lightly
as
was
possible
to
her
patient
but
now
there
was
a
pause
in
the
round
of
action
her
mind
no
longer
keenly
intent
upon
the
immediate
necessities
of
the
moment
began
to
hark
back
again
to
the
one
great
haunting
fear
that
for
so
long
had
overshadowed
it
even
while
she
exerted
herself
to
be
cheerful
and
watched
for
the
smiles
on
hattie
face
her
hands
twisted
tight
and
tighter
under
the
folds
of
her
blouse
and
some
second
self
within
her
seemed
to
say
suppose
suppose
it
should
come
this
thing
i
dread
but
dare
not
name
what
then
what
then
should
i
not
expect
it
is
it
not
almost
a
certainty
have
i
not
been
merely
deceiving
myself
with
the
forlornest
hopes
is
it
not
the
most
reasonable
course
to
expect
the
worst
do
not
all
indications
point
that
way
has
not
my
whole
life
been
shaped
to
this
end
was
not
this
calamity
this
mighty
sorrow
prepared
for
me
even
before
i
was
born
and
one
can
do
nothing
absolutely
nothing
nothing
but
wait
and
hope
and
fear
and
eat
out
one
heart
with
longing
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
instead
of
calling
to
enter
lloyd
went
to
it
softly
and
opened
it
a
few
inches
campbell
was
there
they
come
street
and
the
assistant
lloyd
heard
a
murmur
of
voices
in
the
hall
below
and
the
closing
of
the
front
door
farnham
and
street
went
at
once
to
the
to
make
their
hands
and
wrists
aseptic
campbell
had
gone
downstairs
to
his
it
had
been
decided
though
contrary
to
custom
that
lloyd
should
administer
the
chloroform
at
length
street
tapped
with
the
handle
of
a
scalpel
on
the
door
to
say
that
he
was
ready
now
dear
said
lloyd
turning
to
hattie
and
picking
up
the
ether
cone
but
the
little
girl
courage
suddenly
failed
her
she
began
to
plead
in
a
low
voice
choked
with
tears
her
supplications
were
pitiful
but
lloyd
once
more
intent
upon
her
work
every
faculty
and
thought
concentrated
upon
what
must
be
done
did
not
temporise
an
instant
quietly
she
gathered
hattie
frail
wrists
in
the
grip
of
one
strong
palm
and
held
the
cone
to
her
face
until
she
had
passed
off
with
a
long
sigh
she
picked
her
up
lightly
carried
her
into
the
next
room
and
laid
her
upon
the
at
the
last
moment
lloyd
had
busied
herself
with
the
preparation
of
her
own
person
over
her
dress
she
passed
her
hospital
blouse
which
had
been
under
a
dry
heat
for
hours
she
rolled
her
sleeves
up
from
her
strong
white
forearms
with
their
thick
wrists
and
fine
blue
veining
and
for
upward
of
ten
minutes
scrubbed
them
with
a
new
in
water
as
hot
as
she
could
bear
it
after
this
she
let
her
hands
and
forearms
lie
in
the
permanganate
of
potash
solution
till
they
were
brown
to
the
elbow
then
washed
away
the
stain
in
the
solution
and
in
sterilised
hot
water
street
and
farnham
wearing
their
sterilised
gowns
and
gloves
took
their
places
there
was
no
conversation
the
only
sounds
were
an
occasional
sigh
from
the
patient
a
direction
given
in
a
low
tone
and
at
intervals
the
click
of
the
knives
and
scalpel
from
outside
the
window
came
the
persistent
chirping
of
a
band
of
sparrows
promptly
the
operation
was
begun
there
was
no
delay
no
hesitation
what
there
was
to
be
done
had
been
carefully
planned
beforehand
even
to
the
minutest
details
street
a
master
of
his
profession
thoroughly
familiar
with
every
difficulty
that
might
present
itself
during
the
course
of
the
work
in
hand
foreseeing
every
contingency
prepared
for
every
emergency
calm
watchful
set
about
the
exsecting
of
the
joint
with
no
trace
of
compunction
no
embarrassment
no
misgiving
his
assistants
as
well
as
he
himself
knew
that
life
or
death
hung
upon
the
issue
of
the
next
ten
minutes
upon
street
alone
devolved
the
life
of
the
little
girl
a
second
hesitation
at
the
wrong
stage
of
the
operation
a
slip
of
bistoury
or
scalpel
a
tremor
of
the
wrist
a
single
instant
clumsiness
of
the
fingers
and
the
enemy
watching
for
every
chance
intent
for
every
momentarily
opened
chink
or
cranny
wherein
he
could
thrust
his
lean
fingers
entered
the
frail
tenement
with
a
leap
a
rushing
headlong
spring
that
jarred
the
house
of
life
to
its
foundations
lowering
close
over
her
head
lloyd
felt
the
shadow
of
his
approach
he
had
arrived
there
in
that
commonplace
little
room
with
its
commonplace
accessories
its
ornaments
that
suddenly
seemed
so
trivial
so
impertinent
the
stopped
french
clock
with
its
simpering
gilded
cupids
on
the
mantelpiece
the
photograph
of
a
number
of
picnickers
grouped
on
a
hotel
piazza
gazing
with
monolithic
cheerfulness
at
this
grim
business
this
struggle
of
the
two
world
forces
this
crisis
in
a
life
then
abruptly
the
operation
was
over
the
nurse
and
surgeons
eased
their
positions
immediately
drawing
long
breaths
they
began
to
talk
commenting
upon
the
operation
and
lloyd
intensely
interested
asked
street
why
he
had
contrary
to
her
expectations
removed
the
bone
above
the
lesser
trochanter
he
smiled
delighted
at
her
intelligence
it
better
than
cutting
through
the
neck
miss
searight
he
told
her
if
i
had
gone
through
the
neck
do
you
see
the
trochanter
major
would
come
over
the
hole
and
prevent
the
discharges
yes
yes
i
see
of
course
assented
lloyd
the
incision
was
sewn
up
and
when
all
was
over
lloyd
carried
hattie
back
to
the
bed
in
the
next
room
slowly
the
little
girl
regained
consciousness
and
lloyd
began
to
regard
her
once
more
as
a
human
being
during
the
operation
she
had
forgotten
the
very
existence
of
hattie
campbell
a
little
girl
she
knew
she
had
only
seen
a
bit
of
mechanism
out
of
order
and
in
the
hands
of
a
repairer
it
was
always
so
with
lloyd
her
charges
were
not
infrequently
persons
whom
she
knew
often
intimately
but
during
the
time
of
their
sickness
their
personalities
vanished
for
the
trained
nurse
she
saw
only
the
case
only
the
mechanism
only
the
deranged
clockwork
in
imminent
danger
of
running
down
but
the
danger
was
by
no
means
over
the
operation
had
been
near
the
trunk
there
had
been
considerable
loss
of
blood
and
the
child
power
of
resistance
had
been
weakened
by
long
periods
of
suffering
lloyd
feared
that
the
shock
might
prove
too
great
farnham
departed
but
for
a
little
while
the
surgeon
remained
with
lloyd
to
watch
the
symptoms
at
length
however
he
too
pressed
for
time
and
expected
at
one
of
the
larger
hospitals
of
the
city
went
away
leaving
directions
for
lloyd
to
telephone
him
in
case
of
the
slightest
change
at
this
hour
late
in
the
afternoon
there
were
no
indications
that
the
little
girl
would
not
recover
from
the
shock
street
believed
she
would
rally
and
ultimately
regain
her
health
but
he
told
lloyd
as
he
bade
her
i
do
need
to
impress
upon
you
the
need
of
care
and
the
greatest
vigilance
absolute
rest
is
the
only
thing
she
must
see
nobody
not
even
her
father
the
whole
system
is
numbed
and
deadened
just
yet
but
there
will
be
a
change
either
for
better
or
worse
some
time
for
hours
lloyd
had
not
closed
an
eye
but
of
that
she
had
no
thought
her
supper
was
sent
up
to
her
and
she
prepared
herself
for
her
night
watch
she
gave
the
child
such
nourishment
as
she
believed
she
could
stand
and
from
time
to
time
took
her
pulse
making
records
of
it
upon
her
chart
for
the
surgeon
inspection
later
on
at
intervals
she
took
hattie
temperature
placing
the
clinical
thermometer
in
the
armpit
toward
nine
in
the
evening
while
she
was
doing
this
for
the
third
time
within
the
hour
one
of
the
house
servants
came
to
the
room
to
inform
her
that
she
was
wanted
on
the
telephone
lloyd
hesitated
unwilling
to
leave
hattie
for
an
instant
however
the
telephone
was
close
at
hand
and
it
was
quite
possible
that
street
had
rung
her
up
to
ask
for
news
but
it
was
the
agency
that
had
called
and
miss
douglass
informed
her
that
a
telegram
had
arrived
there
for
her
a
few
moments
before
should
she
hold
it
or
send
it
to
her
by
rownie
lloyd
reflected
a
moment
oh
open
it
and
read
it
to
me
she
said
it
a
call
it
or
no
send
it
here
by
rownie
and
send
my
hospital
slippers
with
her
the
ones
without
heels
but
do
ring
up
again
expecting
a
crisis
almost
any
moment
lloyd
returned
to
the
sent
away
the
servant
and
once
more
settled
herself
for
the
night
hattie
had
roused
for
a
moment
am
i
going
to
get
well
am
i
going
to
get
well
miss
searight
lloyd
put
her
finger
to
her
lips
nodding
her
head
and
hattie
closed
her
eyes
again
with
a
long
breath
a
certain
great
tenderness
and
compassion
for
the
little
girl
grew
big
in
lloyd
heart
to
herself
she
said
god
helping
me
you
shall
get
well
they
believe
in
me
these
people
any
one
could
pull
us
through
it
would
be
miss
searight
we
will
through
yes
for
i
do
it
the
night
closed
down
dark
and
still
and
very
hot
lloyd
regulating
the
ventilation
opened
one
of
the
windows
from
the
top
the
noises
of
the
city
steadily
decreasing
as
the
hours
passed
reached
her
ears
in
a
subdued
droning
murmur
on
her
bed
that
had
for
so
long
been
her
bed
of
pain
hattie
lay
with
closed
eyes
inert
motionless
hardly
seeming
to
breathe
her
life
in
the
balance
unhappy
little
invalid
wasted
with
suffering
with
drawn
pinched
face
and
bloodless
lips
and
at
her
side
lloyd
her
eyes
never
leaving
her
patient
face
alert
and
vigilant
despite
her
long
wakefulness
her
great
flame
of
hair
rolling
from
her
forehead
and
temples
the
sombre
glow
in
her
cheeks
no
whit
diminished
by
her
day
of
fatigue
of
responsibility
and
untiring
activity
for
the
time
being
she
could
thrust
her
fear
the
relentless
enemy
that
for
so
long
had
hung
upon
her
heels
back
and
away
from
her
there
was
another
enemy
now
to
fight
or
was
it
another
was
it
not
the
same
enemy
the
very
same
whose
shadow
loomed
across
that
across
the
frail
small
body
and
pale
drawn
face
with
her
pity
and
compassion
for
the
sick
child
there
arose
in
lloyd
a
certain
unreasoned
intuitive
obstinacy
a
banding
together
of
all
her
powers
and
faculties
in
one
great
effort
at
resistance
a
steadfastness
under
great
stress
a
stubbornness
that
shut
its
ears
and
eyes
it
was
her
one
dominant
characteristic
rising
up
strong
and
insistent
the
instant
she
knew
herself
to
be
thwarted
in
her
desires
or
checked
in
a
course
she
believed
to
be
right
and
good
and
now
as
she
felt
the
advance
of
the
enemy
and
saw
the
shadow
growing
darker
across
the
bed
her
obstinacy
hardened
like
tempered
steel
no
she
murmured
her
brows
levelled
her
lips
compressed
she
shall
not
die
i
will
not
let
her
go
a
little
later
perhaps
an
hour
after
midnight
at
a
time
when
she
believed
hattie
to
be
asleep
lloyd
watchful
as
ever
noted
that
her
cheeks
began
alternately
to
puff
out
and
contract
with
her
breathing
in
an
instant
the
nurse
was
on
her
feet
she
knew
the
meaning
of
this
sign
hattie
had
fainted
while
asleep
lloyd
took
the
temperature
it
was
falling
rapidly
the
pulse
was
weak
rapid
and
irregular
it
seemed
impossible
for
hattie
to
take
a
deep
breath
then
swiftly
the
expected
crisis
began
to
develop
itself
lloyd
ordered
street
to
be
sent
for
but
only
as
a
matter
of
form
long
before
he
could
arrive
the
issue
would
be
decided
she
knew
that
now
hattie
life
depended
on
herself
alone
now
she
murmured
as
though
the
enemy
she
fought
could
hear
her
now
let
us
see
who
is
the
stronger
you
or
i
swiftly
and
gently
she
drew
the
bed
from
the
wall
and
raised
its
foot
propping
it
in
position
with
half
a
dozen
books
then
while
waiting
for
the
servants
whom
she
had
despatched
for
hot
blankets
administered
a
hypodermic
injection
of
brandy
we
will
pull
you
through
she
kept
saying
to
herself
we
will
pull
you
through
i
shall
not
let
you
go
the
enemy
was
close
now
and
the
fight
was
hand
to
hand
lloyd
could
almost
feel
physically
actually
feel
the
slow
sullen
resistless
pull
that
little
by
little
was
dragging
hattie
life
from
her
grip
she
set
her
teeth
holding
back
with
all
her
might
bracing
herself
against
the
strain
refusing
with
all
inborn
stubbornness
to
yield
her
position
no
no
she
repeated
to
herself
you
shall
not
have
her
i
will
not
give
her
up
you
shall
not
triumph
over
me
campbell
was
in
the
room
warned
by
the
ominous
coming
and
going
of
hushed
footsteps
what
is
the
use
nurse
it
all
over
let
her
die
in
peace
it
too
cruel
let
her
die
in
peace
the
passed
then
the
hour
once
more
lloyd
administered
hypodermically
the
second
dose
of
brandy
campbell
unable
to
bear
the
sight
had
withdrawn
to
the
adjoining
room
where
he
could
be
heard
pacing
the
floor
from
time
to
time
he
came
back
for
a
moment
whispering
will
she
live
nurse
will
she
live
shall
we
pull
her
through
i
do
know
lloyd
told
him
i
do
know
wait
go
back
i
will
let
you
know
another
fifteen
minutes
passed
lloyd
fancied
that
the
heart
action
was
growing
a
little
stronger
a
great
stillness
had
settled
over
the
house
the
two
servants
waiting
lloyd
orders
in
the
hall
outside
the
door
refrained
even
from
whispering
from
the
next
room
came
the
muffled
sound
of
pacing
footsteps
hurried
irregular
while
with
that
strange
perversity
which
seizes
upon
the
senses
at
moments
when
they
are
more
than
usually
acute
lloyd
began
to
be
aware
of
a
vague
unwonted
movement
in
the
city
itself
outside
there
behind
the
drawn
curtains
and
window
a
faint
uncertain
agitation
a
trouble
a
passing
ripple
on
the
still
black
pool
of
the
night
coming
and
going
and
coming
again
each
time
a
little
more
insistent
each
time
claiming
a
little
more
attention
and
notice
it
was
about
half
past
three
but
the
little
patient
temperature
was
rising
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
that
the
lungs
expanded
wider
and
deeper
hattie
breathing
was
unmistakably
easier
and
as
lloyd
put
her
fingers
to
the
wrist
she
could
hardly
keep
back
a
little
exultant
cry
as
she
felt
the
pulse
throbbing
fuller
a
little
slower
a
little
more
regularly
now
she
redoubled
her
attention
her
hold
upon
the
little
life
shut
tighter
her
power
of
resistance
her
strength
of
purpose
seemed
to
be
suddenly
quadrupled
she
could
imagine
the
enemy
drawing
off
she
could
think
that
the
grip
of
cold
fingers
was
loosening
slowly
the
crisis
passed
off
slowly
the
reaction
began
hattie
was
still
unconscious
but
there
was
a
new
look
upon
her
face
a
look
that
lloyd
had
learned
to
know
from
long
experience
an
intangible
and
most
illusive
expression
nothing
something
the
sign
that
only
those
who
are
trained
to
search
for
it
may
see
and
appreciate
the
earliest
faint
flicker
after
the
passing
of
the
shadow
will
she
live
will
she
live
nurse
came
campbell
whisper
at
her
shoulder
i
think
i
am
almost
sure
but
we
must
not
be
too
certain
yet
still
there
a
chance
yes
there
a
chance
campbell
suddenly
gone
white
put
out
his
hand
and
leaned
a
moment
against
the
mantelpiece
he
did
not
now
leave
the
room
the
rang
street
murmured
lloyd
but
what
had
happened
in
the
city
there
in
the
still
dark
hours
of
that
hot
summer
night
an
event
of
national
perhaps
even
international
importance
had
surely
transpired
it
was
in
the
air
a
sense
of
a
great
thing
come
suddenly
to
a
head
somewhere
in
the
world
footsteps
sounded
rapidly
on
the
echoing
sidewalks
here
and
there
a
street
door
opened
from
corner
to
corner
growing
swiftly
nearer
came
the
cry
of
newsboys
chanting
extras
a
subdued
excitement
was
abroad
finding
expression
in
a
vague
murmur
the
mingling
of
many
sounds
into
one
huge
note
a
note
that
gradually
swelled
and
grew
louder
and
seemed
to
be
rising
from
all
corners
of
the
city
at
once
there
was
a
step
at
the
door
street
no
rownie
rownie
with
two
telegrams
for
lloyd
lloyd
took
them
from
her
then
with
a
sharp
brusque
movement
of
her
head
and
suddenly
smitten
with
an
idea
turned
from
them
to
listen
to
the
low
swelling
murmur
of
the
city
these
despatches
no
they
were
no
call
for
her
she
guessed
what
they
might
be
why
had
they
come
to
her
now
why
was
there
this
sense
of
some
great
tidings
in
the
wind
the
same
tidings
that
had
come
to
the
world
might
come
to
her
in
these
despatches
might
it
not
be
so
she
caught
her
breath
quickly
the
terror
the
fearful
anxiety
that
had
haunted
and
oppressed
her
for
so
long
was
it
to
be
lifted
now
at
last
the
enemy
that
lurked
in
the
dark
corners
ever
ready
to
clutch
her
was
it
to
be
driven
back
and
away
from
her
forever
she
dared
not
hope
for
it
but
something
was
coming
to
her
she
knew
it
she
felt
it
something
was
preparing
for
her
coming
to
her
swifter
with
every
second
coming
coming
coming
from
out
the
north
she
saw
street
in
the
room
though
how
and
when
he
had
arrived
she
could
not
afterward
recall
her
mind
was
all
alert
intent
upon
other
things
listening
waiting
the
surgeon
had
been
leaning
over
the
bed
suddenly
he
straightened
up
saying
aloud
to
campbell
good
good
we
safe
we
have
pulled
through
lloyd
tore
open
her
telegrams
one
was
signed
bennett
the
other
ferriss
thank
god
exclaimed
campbell
oh
cried
lloyd
a
great
sob
shaking
her
from
head
to
heel
a
smile
of
infinite
happiness
flashing
from
her
face
oh
yes
thank
god
we
we
pulled
through
am
i
going
to
get
well
am
i
going
to
get
well
miss
searight
hattie
once
more
conscious
raised
her
voice
weak
and
faint
lloyd
was
on
her
knees
beside
her
her
head
bent
over
her
hush
yes
dear
you
are
safe
then
the
royal
hair
bent
lower
still
the
eyes
were
streaming
now
the
voice
one
low
quiver
of
sobs
tenderly
gently
lloyd
put
an
arm
about
the
child
her
head
bending
lower
and
lower
her
cheek
touched
hattie
for
a
moment
the
little
girl
frail
worn
pitifully
wasted
and
the
strong
vigorous
woman
with
her
imperious
will
and
indomitable
purpose
rested
their
heads
upon
the
same
pillow
both
broken
with
suffering
the
one
of
the
body
the
other
of
the
mind
safe
yes
dear
safe
whispered
lloyd
her
face
all
but
hidden
safe
safe
and
saved
to
me
oh
dearest
of
all
the
world
and
then
to
her
ears
the
murmur
of
the
city
seemed
to
leap
suddenly
to
articulate
words
the
clanging
thunder
of
the
entire
nation
the
whole
round
world
thrilling
with
this
great
news
that
had
come
to
it
from
out
the
north
in
the
small
hours
of
this
hot
summer
night
and
the
chanting
cries
of
the
street
rolled
to
her
like
the
tremendous
diapason
of
a
gigantic
organ
rescued
rescued
rescued
iv
on
the
day
that
lloyd
returned
to
the
house
on
calumet
square
recovery
being
long
since
assured
and
while
she
was
unpacking
her
valise
and
settling
herself
again
in
her
room
a
messenger
boy
brought
her
a
note
have
just
arrived
in
the
city
when
may
i
see
you
bennett
news
of
ward
bennett
and
of
richard
ferriss
had
not
been
wanting
during
the
past
fortnight
or
so
their
names
and
that
of
the
ship
herself
even
the
names
of
adler
hansen
clarke
and
dennison
even
muck
tu
even
that
of
kamiska
the
one
surviving
dog
filled
the
mouths
and
minds
of
men
to
the
exclusion
of
everything
else
the
return
of
the
expedition
after
its
long
imprisonment
in
the
ice
and
at
a
time
when
all
hope
of
its
safety
had
been
abandoned
was
one
of
the
great
events
of
that
year
the
fact
that
the
expedition
had
failed
to
reach
the
pole
or
to
attain
any
unusual
high
latitude
was
forgotten
or
ignored
nothing
was
remembered
but
the
masterly
retreat
toward
kolyuchin
bay
the
wonderful
march
over
the
ice
the
indomitable
courage
unshaken
by
hardship
perils
obstacles
and
privations
almost
beyond
imagination
all
this
together
with
a
multitude
of
details
some
of
them
palpably
fictitious
the
press
of
the
city
where
bennett
and
ferriss
both
had
their
homes
published
and
republished
and
published
again
and
again
news
of
the
men
their
whereabouts
and
intentions
invaded
the
where
lloyd
watched
over
the
convalescence
of
her
little
patient
by
the
very
chinks
of
the
windows
lloyd
learned
how
the
ship
had
been
nipped
how
after
inconceivable
toil
the
members
of
the
expedition
had
gained
the
land
how
they
had
marched
southward
toward
the
chuckch
settlements
how
at
the
eleventh
hour
the
survivors
exhausted
and
starving
had
been
rescued
by
the
steam
whalers
how
these
whalers
themselves
had
been
caught
in
the
ice
and
how
the
survivors
of
the
freja
had
been
obliged
to
spend
another
winter
in
the
arctic
she
learned
the
details
of
their
final
return
in
the
quiet
darkened
room
where
hattie
lay
she
heard
from
without
the
echo
of
the
thunder
of
the
nations
she
saw
how
the
figure
of
bennett
towered
suddenly
magnificent
in
the
world
how
that
the
people
were
brusquely
made
aware
of
a
new
hero
she
learned
that
honours
came
thronging
about
him
unsought
that
the
king
of
the
belgians
had
conferred
a
decoration
upon
him
that
the
geographical
societies
of
continental
europe
had
elected
him
to
honourary
membership
that
the
president
and
the
secretary
of
war
had
sent
telegrams
of
congratulations
and
what
does
he
do
she
murmured
the
first
of
all
upon
his
return
asks
to
see
me
me
she
sent
an
answer
to
his
note
by
the
same
boy
who
brought
it
naming
the
following
afternoon
explaining
that
two
days
later
she
expected
to
go
into
the
country
to
a
little
town
called
bannister
to
take
her
annual
fortnight
vacation
but
what
of
of
the
other
she
murmured
as
she
stood
at
the
window
of
her
room
watching
the
messenger
boy
bicycling
across
the
square
why
does
not
he
he
too
she
put
her
chin
in
the
air
and
turned
about
looking
abstractedly
at
the
rugs
on
the
parquetry
lloyd
vacation
had
really
begun
two
days
before
her
name
was
off
the
roster
of
the
house
and
till
the
end
of
the
month
her
time
was
her
own
the
afternoon
was
hot
and
very
still
even
in
the
cool
agency
with
its
windows
wide
and
heavily
shaded
with
awnings
the
heat
was
oppressive
for
a
long
time
lloyd
had
been
shut
away
from
fresh
air
and
the
sun
and
now
she
suddenly
decided
to
drive
out
in
the
park
she
rang
up
her
stable
and
ordered
lewis
to
put
her
ponies
to
her
phaeton
she
spent
a
delightful
two
hours
in
the
great
park
losing
herself
in
its
farthest
shadiest
and
most
unfrequented
corners
she
drove
herself
and
intelligently
horses
were
her
passion
and
not
lewis
himself
understood
their
care
and
management
better
toward
the
cool
of
the
day
and
just
as
she
had
pulled
the
ponies
down
to
a
walk
in
a
long
deserted
avenue
overspanned
with
elms
and
great
cottonwoods
she
was
all
at
once
aware
of
an
open
carriage
that
had
turned
into
the
far
end
of
the
same
avenue
approaching
at
an
easy
trot
it
drew
near
and
she
saw
that
its
only
occupant
was
a
man
leaning
back
rather
limply
in
the
cushions
as
the
eye
of
the
trained
nurse
fell
upon
him
she
at
once
placed
him
in
the
category
of
convalescents
or
chronic
invalids
and
she
was
vaguely
speculating
as
to
the
nature
of
his
complaint
when
the
carriage
drew
opposite
her
phaeton
and
she
recognised
richard
ferriss
ferriss
but
not
the
same
ferriss
to
whom
she
had
said
on
that
march
afternoon
with
its
gusts
and
rain
four
long
years
ago
the
ferriss
she
had
known
then
had
been
an
alert
keen
man
with
quick
bright
eyes
alive
to
every
impression
responsive
to
every
sensation
living
his
full
allowance
of
life
she
was
looking
now
at
a
man
unnaturally
old
of
deadened
nerves
listless
as
he
caught
sight
of
her
and
recognised
her
he
suddenly
roused
himself
with
a
quick
glad
smile
and
with
a
look
in
his
eyes
that
to
lloyd
was
unmistakable
but
there
was
not
that
joyful
exuberant
start
she
had
anticipated
and
for
that
matter
wished
neither
did
lloyd
set
any
too
great
store
by
the
small
amenities
of
life
but
that
ferriss
should
remain
covered
hurt
her
a
little
she
wondered
how
she
could
note
so
trivial
a
detail
at
such
a
moment
but
this
was
ferriss
her
heart
was
beating
fast
and
thick
as
she
halted
her
ponies
the
driver
of
the
carriage
jumped
down
and
held
the
door
for
ferriss
and
the
chief
engineer
stepped
quickly
toward
her
so
it
was
they
met
after
four
years
and
such
years
unexpectedly
without
warning
or
preparation
and
not
at
all
as
she
had
expected
what
they
said
to
each
other
in
those
first
few
moments
lloyd
could
never
afterward
clearly
remember
one
incident
alone
detached
itself
vividly
from
the
blur
i
have
just
come
from
the
square
ferriss
had
explained
and
they
told
me
that
you
had
left
for
a
drive
out
here
only
the
moment
before
so
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
come
after
you
sha
we
walk
a
little
she
remembered
she
had
asked
after
a
while
we
can
have
the
carriages
wait
or
do
you
feel
strong
enough
i
forgot
but
he
interrupted
her
protesting
his
fitness
the
doctor
merely
sent
me
out
to
get
the
air
and
it
humiliating
to
be
wheeled
about
like
an
old
woman
lloyd
passed
the
reins
back
of
her
to
lewis
and
gathering
her
skirts
about
her
started
to
descend
from
the
phaeton
the
step
was
rather
high
from
the
ground
ferriss
stood
close
by
why
did
he
not
help
her
why
did
he
stand
there
his
hands
in
his
pockets
so
listless
and
unconscious
of
her
difficulty
a
little
glow
of
irritation
deepened
the
dull
crimson
of
her
cheeks
even
returned
arctic
explorers
could
not
afford
to
ignore
entirely
life
little
courtesies
and
he
of
all
men
well
she
said
expectantly
hesitating
before
attempting
to
descend
then
she
caught
ferriss
eyes
fixed
upon
her
he
was
smiling
a
little
but
the
dull
stupefied
expression
of
his
face
seemed
for
a
brief
instant
to
give
place
to
one
of
great
sadness
he
raised
a
shoulder
resignedly
and
lloyd
with
the
suddenness
of
a
blow
remembered
that
ferriss
had
no
hands
she
dropped
back
in
the
seat
of
the
phaeton
covering
her
eyes
shaken
and
unnerved
for
the
moment
with
a
great
thrill
of
infinite
pity
of
shame
at
her
own
awkwardness
and
of
horror
as
for
one
brief
instant
the
smiling
summer
park
the
afternoon
warmth
the
avenue
of
green
trees
the
trim
lacquered
vehicles
and
horses
were
struck
from
her
mind
and
she
had
a
swift
vision
of
the
ice
the
darkness
of
the
winter
night
the
lacerating
merciless
cold
the
blinding
whirling
snow
for
half
an
hour
they
walked
slowly
about
in
the
park
the
carriages
following
at
a
distance
they
did
not
talk
very
much
it
seemed
to
lloyd
that
she
would
never
tire
of
scrutinising
his
face
that
her
interest
in
his
point
of
view
his
opinions
would
never
flag
he
had
had
an
experience
that
came
but
to
few
men
for
four
years
he
had
been
out
of
the
world
had
undergone
privation
beyond
conception
what
now
was
to
be
his
attitude
how
had
he
changed
that
he
had
not
changed
to
her
lloyd
knew
in
an
instant
he
still
loved
her
that
was
beyond
all
doubt
but
this
terrible
apathy
that
seemed
now
to
be
a
part
of
him
she
had
heard
of
the
numbing
stupor
that
invades
those
who
stay
beyond
their
time
in
the
ice
but
never
before
had
she
seen
it
in
its
reality
it
was
not
a
lack
of
intelligence
it
seemed
rather
to
be
the
machinery
of
intelligence
rusted
and
clogged
from
long
disuse
he
deliberated
long
before
he
spoke
it
took
him
some
time
to
understand
things
speech
did
not
come
to
him
readily
and
he
became
easily
confused
in
the
matter
of
words
once
suddenly
he
had
interrupted
her
breaking
out
with
oh
the
smell
of
the
trees
of
the
grass
is
it
wonderful
is
it
wonderful
and
a
few
seconds
later
quite
irrelevantly
and
after
all
we
failed
at
once
lloyd
was
all
aroused
defending
him
against
himself
failed
and
you
say
that
if
you
did
not
reach
the
pole
what
then
the
world
will
judge
you
by
results
perhaps
and
the
world
judgment
will
be
wrong
is
it
nothing
that
you
have
given
the
world
an
example
of
heroism
oh
do
call
it
that
of
heroism
of
courage
of
endurance
is
it
nothing
that
you
have
overcome
obstacles
before
which
other
men
would
have
died
is
it
nothing
that
you
have
shown
us
all
how
to
be
patient
how
to
be
strong
there
are
some
things
better
even
than
reaching
the
pole
to
suffer
and
be
calm
is
one
of
them
not
to
give
up
never
to
be
beaten
is
another
oh
if
i
were
a
man
ten
thousand
a
hundred
thousand
people
are
reading
of
what
you
have
done
of
what
you
have
done
you
understand
not
of
what
you
have
failed
to
do
they
have
seen
you
have
shown
them
what
the
man
can
do
who
says
and
you
have
done
a
little
more
have
gone
a
little
further
have
been
a
little
braver
a
little
hardier
a
little
nobler
a
little
more
determined
than
any
one
has
ever
been
before
whoever
fails
now
can
not
excuse
himself
by
saying
that
he
has
done
as
much
as
a
man
can
do
he
will
have
to
remember
the
men
of
the
freja
he
will
have
to
remember
you
do
you
suppose
i
am
proud
of
you
do
you
suppose
that
i
am
stronger
and
better
because
of
what
you
have
done
do
you
think
it
is
nothing
for
me
to
be
sitting
here
beside
you
here
in
this
park
to
be
yes
to
be
with
you
ca
you
understand
is
it
something
to
me
that
you
are
the
man
you
are
not
the
man
whose
name
the
people
are
shouting
just
now
not
the
man
to
whom
a
king
gave
a
bit
of
ribbon
and
enamel
but
the
man
who
lived
like
a
man
who
would
not
die
just
because
it
was
easier
to
die
than
to
live
who
fought
like
a
man
not
only
for
himself
but
for
the
lives
of
those
he
led
who
showed
us
all
how
to
be
strong
and
how
strong
one
could
be
if
one
would
only
try
what
does
the
pole
amount
to
the
world
wants
men
great
strong
harsh
brutal
men
men
with
purposes
who
let
nothing
nothing
nothing
stand
in
their
way
you
mean
bennett
said
ferriss
looking
up
quickly
you
commenced
by
speaking
of
me
but
it
bennett
you
are
talking
of
now
but
he
caught
her
glance
and
saw
that
she
was
looking
steadfastly
at
him
at
him
a
look
was
in
her
face
a
light
in
her
eyes
that
he
had
never
seen
there
before
lloyd
he
said
quietly
which
one
of
us
bennett
or
i
were
you
speaking
of
just
then
you
know
what
i
mean
which
one
of
us
i
was
speaking
of
the
man
who
was
strong
enough
to
do
great
things
she
said
ferriss
drew
the
stumps
of
his
arms
from
his
pockets
and
smiled
at
them
grimly
h
can
one
do
much
this
way
he
muttered
with
a
movement
she
did
not
try
to
restrain
lloyd
put
both
her
hands
over
his
poor
shapeless
wrists
never
in
her
life
had
she
been
so
strongly
moved
pity
such
as
she
had
never
known
a
tenderness
and
compassion
such
as
she
had
never
experienced
went
knocking
at
her
breast
she
had
no
words
at
hand
for
so
great
emotions
she
longed
to
tell
him
what
was
in
her
heart
but
all
speech
failed
do
she
exclaimed
do
i
will
not
have
you
a
little
later
as
they
were
returning
toward
the
carriages
lloyd
after
a
moment
deliberation
upon
the
matter
said
ca
i
set
you
down
somewhere
near
your
rooms
let
your
carriage
go
he
shook
his
head
i
just
given
up
my
downtown
rooms
bennett
and
i
have
taken
other
rooms
much
farther
uptown
in
fact
i
believe
i
am
supposed
to
be
going
there
now
it
would
be
quite
out
of
your
way
to
take
me
there
we
are
much
quieter
out
there
and
people
ca
get
at
us
so
readily
the
doctor
says
we
both
need
rest
after
our
shaking
up
bennett
himself
iron
as
he
is
is
none
too
strong
and
what
with
the
mail
the
telegrams
reporters
deputations
editors
and
visitors
and
the
like
we
are
kept
on
something
of
a
strain
besides
we
have
still
a
good
deal
of
work
to
do
getting
our
notes
into
shape
lewis
brought
the
ponies
to
the
edge
of
the
walk
and
lloyd
and
ferriss
separated
she
turning
the
ponies
heads
homeward
starting
away
at
a
brisk
trot
and
leaving
him
in
his
carriage
which
he
had
directed
to
carry
him
to
his
new
quarters
but
at
the
turn
of
the
avenue
lloyd
leaned
from
the
phaeton
and
looked
back
the
carriage
was
just
disappearing
down
the
vista
of
elms
and
cottonwoods
she
waved
her
hand
gayly
and
ferriss
responded
with
the
stump
of
one
forearm
on
the
next
day
but
one
a
friday
lloyd
was
to
go
to
the
country
every
year
in
the
heat
of
the
summer
lloyd
spent
her
short
vacation
in
the
sleepy
and
little
village
of
bannister
the
country
around
the
village
was
part
of
the
searight
estate
it
was
quiet
off
the
railroad
just
the
place
to
forget
duties
responsibilities
and
the
wearing
anxieties
of
but
thursday
afternoon
she
expected
bennett
thursday
morning
she
was
in
her
room
her
trunk
was
already
packed
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
done
she
was
off
duty
there
was
neither
care
nor
responsibility
upon
her
mind
but
she
was
too
joyful
too
happily
exalted
too
exuberant
in
gayety
to
pass
her
time
in
reading
she
wanted
action
movement
life
and
instinctively
threw
open
a
window
of
her
room
and
according
to
her
habit
leaned
upon
her
elbows
and
looked
out
and
down
upon
the
square
the
morning
was
charming
later
in
the
day
it
probably
would
be
very
hot
but
as
yet
the
breeze
of
the
earliest
hours
was
stirring
nimbly
the
cool
of
it
put
a
brisker
note
in
the
sombre
glow
of
her
cheeks
and
just
stirred
a
lock
that
escaping
from
her
gorgeous
coils
of
hair
hung
curling
over
her
ear
and
neck
into
her
eyes
of
dull
blue
like
the
blue
of
old
china
the
morning
sun
sent
an
occasional
unwonted
sparkle
over
the
asphalt
and
over
the
green
of
the
square
the
shadows
of
the
venerable
elms
wove
a
shifting
maze
of
tracery
traffic
avoided
the
place
it
was
invariably
quiet
in
the
square
and
one
as
now
could
always
hear
the
subdued
ripple
and
murmur
of
the
fountain
in
the
centre
but
the
crowning
delight
of
that
morning
was
the
sudden
appearance
of
a
robin
in
a
tree
close
to
lloyd
window
he
was
searching
his
breakfast
at
every
moment
he
came
and
went
between
the
and
the
very
important
very
preoccupied
chittering
and
calling
the
while
as
though
he
would
never
tire
lloyd
whistled
to
him
and
instantly
he
answered
cocking
his
head
sideways
she
whistled
again
and
he
piped
back
an
impudent
response
and
for
quite
five
minutes
the
two
held
an
elaborate
altercation
between
and
lloyd
caught
herself
laughing
outright
and
aloud
for
no
assignable
reason
ah
the
world
was
a
pretty
good
place
after
all
a
little
later
and
while
she
was
still
at
the
window
rownie
brought
her
a
note
from
bennett
sent
by
special
messenger
ferriss
woke
up
sick
this
morning
nobody
here
but
the
two
of
us
ca
leave
him
alone
bennett
oh
exclaimed
lloyd
searight
a
little
blankly
the
robin
and
his
effrontery
at
once
ceased
to
be
amusing
she
closed
the
window
abruptly
shutting
out
the
summer
morning
gayety
and
charm
turning
her
back
upon
the
sunlight
now
she
was
more
in
the
humour
of
reading
on
the
great
divan
against
the
wall
lay
the
month
magazines
and
two
illustrated
weeklies
lloyd
had
bought
them
to
read
on
the
train
but
now
she
settled
herself
upon
the
divan
and
picking
up
one
of
the
weeklies
turned
its
leaves
listlessly
all
at
once
she
came
upon
two
pictures
admirably
reproduced
from
photographs
and
serving
as
illustrations
to
the
weekly
main
article
the
two
leaders
of
the
freja
expedition
one
was
a
picture
of
bennett
the
other
of
ferriss
the
suddenness
with
which
she
had
come
upon
his
likeness
almost
took
lloyd
breath
from
her
it
was
the
last
thing
she
had
expected
if
he
himself
had
abruptly
entered
the
room
in
person
she
could
hardly
have
been
more
surprised
her
heart
gave
a
great
leap
the
dull
crimson
of
her
cheeks
shot
to
her
forehead
then
with
a
charming
movement
at
once
impulsive
and
shamefaced
smiling
the
while
her
eyes
she
laid
her
cheek
upon
the
picture
murmuring
to
herself
words
that
only
herself
should
hear
the
next
day
she
left
for
the
country
on
that
same
day
when
pitts
arrived
at
the
rooms
ferriss
and
bennett
had
taken
he
found
the
anteroom
already
crowded
with
visitors
a
knot
of
interviewers
the
manager
of
a
lecture
bureau
as
well
as
the
agent
of
a
patented
cereal
who
sought
the
man
of
the
hour
for
an
endorsement
of
his
article
and
two
female
reporters
decidedly
richard
ferriss
was
ill
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
that
bennett
had
not
slept
the
night
before
but
had
gone
to
and
fro
about
the
rooms
tending
to
his
wants
with
a
solicitude
and
a
gentleness
that
in
a
man
so
harsh
and
so
toughly
fibred
seemed
strangely
out
of
place
bennett
was
far
from
well
himself
the
terrible
milling
which
he
had
undergone
had
told
even
upon
that
enormous
frame
but
his
own
ailments
were
promptly
ignored
now
that
ferriss
the
man
of
all
men
to
him
was
down
i
did
pull
through
with
you
old
man
he
responded
to
all
of
ferriss
protests
to
have
you
get
sick
on
my
hands
at
this
time
of
day
no
more
of
your
damned
foolishness
now
here
the
quinine
down
with
it
bennett
met
pitts
at
the
door
of
ferriss
room
and
before
going
in
drew
him
into
a
corner
he
a
sick
boy
pitts
and
is
going
to
be
worse
though
he
just
enough
of
a
fool
boy
not
to
admit
it
i
seen
them
start
off
this
gait
before
remember
too
when
you
look
him
over
that
it
not
as
though
he
had
been
in
a
healthy
condition
before
our
work
in
the
ice
ground
him
down
about
as
fine
as
he
could
go
and
yet
live
and
the
hardtack
and
salt
pork
on
the
steam
whalers
were
not
a
good
diet
for
a
convalescent
and
see
here
pitts
said
bennett
clearing
his
throat
i
well
rather
fond
of
that
fool
boy
in
there
we
are
not
taking
any
chances
you
understand
after
the
doctor
had
seen
the
chief
engineer
and
had
prescribed
calomel
and
a
milk
diet
bennett
followed
him
out
into
the
hall
and
accompanied
him
to
the
door
verdict
he
demanded
fixing
the
physician
intently
with
his
small
distorted
eyes
but
pitts
was
yes
he
a
sick
boy
but
the
thing
whatever
it
is
going
to
be
has
been
gathering
slowly
he
complains
of
headache
great
weakness
and
nausea
and
you
speak
of
frequent
during
the
night
the
abdomen
is
tender
upon
pressure
which
is
a
symptom
i
would
rather
not
have
found
but
i
ca
make
any
positive
diagnosis
as
yet
some
big
sickness
is
coming
on
that
i
am
afraid
is
certain
i
shall
come
out
here
but
bennett
be
careful
of
yourself
even
steel
can
weaken
you
know
you
see
this
rabble
he
motioned
with
his
head
toward
the
anteroom
where
the
other
visitors
were
waiting
that
is
hounding
you
everybody
knows
where
you
are
man
you
must
have
rest
i
need
to
look
at
you
more
than
once
to
know
that
get
away
get
away
even
from
your
mails
hide
from
everybody
for
a
while
do
think
you
can
nurse
your
friend
through
these
next
few
weeks
because
you
ca
well
answered
bennett
wait
a
few
days
we
see
by
the
end
of
the
week
the
week
passed
ferriss
went
gradually
from
bad
to
worse
though
as
yet
the
disease
persistently
refused
to
declare
itself
he
was
quite
helpless
and
bennett
watched
over
him
night
and
day
pottering
around
him
by
the
hour
giving
him
his
medicines
cooking
his
food
and
even
when
ferriss
complained
of
the
hotness
of
the
bedclothes
changing
the
very
linen
that
he
might
lie
upon
cool
sheets
but
at
the
end
of
the
week
pitts
declared
that
bennett
himself
was
in
great
danger
of
breaking
down
and
was
of
no
great
service
to
the
sick
man
said
the
doctor
i
shall
have
a
young
fellow
here
who
happens
to
be
a
cousin
of
mine
he
is
an
excellent
trained
nurse
a
fellow
we
can
rely
upon
he
take
your
place
i
have
him
here
and
you
must
get
away
hide
somewhere
do
even
allow
your
mail
to
be
forwarded
the
nurse
and
i
will
take
care
of
ferriss
you
can
leave
me
your
address
and
i
will
wire
you
if
it
is
necessary
now
be
persuaded
like
a
reasonable
man
i
will
stake
my
professional
reputation
that
you
will
knock
under
if
you
stay
here
with
a
sick
man
on
your
hands
and
newspaper
men
taking
the
house
by
storm
at
all
hours
of
the
day
come
now
will
you
go
ferriss
is
in
no
danger
and
you
will
do
him
more
harm
by
staying
than
by
going
so
long
as
you
remain
here
you
will
have
this
raft
of
people
in
the
rooms
at
all
hours
deny
yourself
keep
them
out
keep
out
the
american
reporter
when
he
goes
gunning
for
a
returned
explorer
do
you
think
this
and
he
pointed
again
to
the
crowd
in
the
anteroom
is
the
right
condition
for
a
sick
man
quarters
you
are
imperilling
his
safety
to
say
nothing
of
your
own
by
staying
beside
him
you
draw
the
fire
mr
bennett
well
there
something
in
that
muttered
bennett
pulling
at
his
mustache
but
bennett
hesitated
then
pitts
i
want
you
to
take
my
place
here
if
i
go
away
have
a
nurse
if
you
like
but
i
should
feel
justified
in
leaving
the
boy
in
his
condition
unless
i
knew
you
were
with
him
continually
i
do
know
what
your
practice
is
worth
to
you
say
for
a
month
or
until
the
boy
is
out
of
danger
but
make
me
a
proposition
i
think
we
can
come
to
an
understanding
but
it
wo
be
necessary
to
have
a
doctor
with
ferriss
constantly
i
should
see
him
every
day
and
the
nurse
bennett
promptly
overrode
his
objections
harshly
and
abruptly
he
exclaimed
i
not
taking
any
chances
it
shall
be
as
i
say
i
want
the
boy
well
and
i
want
you
and
the
nurse
to
see
to
it
that
he
well
i
meet
the
expenses
bennett
did
not
hear
the
doctor
response
and
his
suggestion
as
to
the
advisability
of
taking
ferriss
to
his
own
house
in
the
country
while
he
could
be
moved
for
the
moment
he
was
not
listening
an
idea
had
abruptly
presented
itself
to
him
he
was
to
go
to
the
country
but
where
a
grim
smile
began
to
relax
the
lips
and
the
hard
set
of
the
protruding
jaw
he
tugged
again
at
his
mustache
scowling
at
the
doctor
trying
to
hide
his
humour
well
that
settled
then
he
said
i
get
away
somewhere
whereabouts
demanded
the
doctor
i
shall
want
to
let
you
know
how
we
progress
bennett
chose
to
feel
a
certain
irritation
what
business
of
pitts
was
it
whom
he
went
to
see
or
rather
where
he
meant
to
go
you
told
me
to
hide
away
from
everybody
not
even
to
allow
my
mail
to
be
forwarded
but
i
let
you
know
where
to
reach
me
of
course
as
soon
as
i
get
there
it
wo
be
far
from
town
and
i
will
take
your
place
here
with
ferriss
somebody
will
be
with
him
at
every
moment
and
i
shall
only
wire
you
continued
the
doctor
in
case
of
urgent
necessity
i
want
you
to
have
all
the
rest
you
can
and
stay
away
as
long
as
possible
i
sha
annoy
you
with
telegrams
unless
i
must
you
understand
that
no
news
is
good
news
on
that
particular
morning
lloyd
sat
in
her
room
in
the
old
farmhouse
that
she
always
elected
to
call
her
home
as
often
as
she
visited
bannister
it
was
some
quarter
of
a
mile
outside
the
little
village
and
on
the
road
that
connected
it
with
the
railway
at
fourth
lake
some
six
miles
over
the
hills
to
the
east
it
was
yet
early
in
the
morning
and
lloyd
was
writing
letters
that
she
would
post
at
fourth
lake
later
in
the
forenoon
she
intended
driving
over
to
the
lake
two
days
before
lewis
had
arrived
with
rox
the
ponies
and
the
phaeton
a
very
gorgeous
affair
was
always
kept
at
bannister
the
room
in
which
she
now
sat
was
delightful
everything
was
white
from
the
curtains
of
the
bed
to
the
chintz
hangings
on
the
walls
a
rug
of
white
fur
was
on
the
floor
the
panellings
and
wooden
shutters
of
the
windows
were
painted
white
the
fireplace
was
set
in
tiles
and
its
opening
covered
with
a
screen
of
white
feathers
the
windows
were
flung
wide
and
a
great
flood
of
white
sunlight
came
pouring
into
the
room
lloyd
herself
was
dressed
in
white
from
the
clean
crisp
scarf
tied
about
her
neck
to
the
tip
of
her
canvas
tennis
shoes
and
in
all
this
array
of
white
only
the
flame
of
her
hair
in
the
sunshine
glowing
like
burnished
copper
set
a
vivid
note
of
colour
the
little
strands
and
locks
about
her
neck
and
ears
coruscating
as
the
breeze
from
the
open
windows
stirred
them
the
morning
was
veritably
royal
still
cool
and
odorous
of
woods
and
cattle
and
growing
grass
a
great
sense
of
gayety
of
exhilaration
was
in
the
air
lloyd
was
all
in
tune
with
it
while
she
wrote
her
left
elbow
rested
on
the
table
and
in
her
left
hand
she
held
a
huge
green
apple
unripe
sour
delicious
beyond
words
and
into
which
she
bit
from
time
to
time
with
the
silent
enjoyment
of
a
her
letter
was
to
hattie
father
campbell
and
she
wrote
to
ask
if
the
little
girl
might
not
spend
a
week
with
her
at
bannister
when
the
letter
was
finished
and
addressed
she
thrust
it
into
her
belt
and
putting
on
her
hat
ran
downstairs
lewis
had
brought
the
to
the
gate
and
stood
waiting
in
the
road
by
rox
head
but
as
lloyd
went
down
the
walk
of
the
front
yard
applegate
who
owned
the
farmhouse
and
who
was
at
once
lloyd
tenant
landlady
housekeeper
and
cook
appeared
on
the
porch
of
the
house
the
head
of
a
fish
in
her
hand
and
the
yellow
tomcat
at
her
heels
eyeing
her
with
painful
intentness
say
miss
searight
she
called
her
forearm
across
her
forehead
to
shade
her
eyes
the
hand
still
holding
the
fish
head

answered
lloyd
climbing
to
the
high
seat
and
if
i
find
him
i
shall
drag
him
back
by
the
scruff
of
his
neck
lewis
why
have
you
put
the
overhead
check
on
rox
lewis
touched
his
cap
he
feels
his
oats
some
this
morning
and
if
he
gets
his
lower
jaw
his
chest
there
no
holding
of
him
miss
no
holding
of
him
in
the
world
lloyd
gathered
up
the
reins
and
spoke
to
the
horse
and
lewis
stood
aside
rox
promptly
went
up
into
the
air
on
his
hind
legs
shaking
his
head
with
a
great
snort
steady
you
old
pig
said
lloyd
calmly
soh
soh
who
trying
to
kill
you
had
i
better
come
with
you
miss
inquired
lewis
anxiously
lloyd
shook
her
head
no
indeed
she
said
decisively
rox
after
vindicating
his
own
independence
by
the
proper
amount
of
showing
off
started
away
down
the
road
with
as
high
an
action
as
he
could
command
playing
to
the
gallery
looking
back
and
out
of
the
tail
of
his
eye
to
see
if
lewis
observed
what
a
terrible
fellow
he
was
that
morning
well
of
all
the
critters
commented
applegate
from
the
porch
but
with
an
almost
hypnotic
fixity
in
his
yellow
eyes
and
who
during
the
last
few
minutes
had
several
times
opened
his
mouth
wide
in
an
ineffectual
attempt
to
mew
suddenly
found
his
voice
with
a
prolonged
and
complaining
note
well
heavens
an
airth
take
your
fish
then
exclaimed
applegate
suddenly
remembering
the
cat
an
get
my
porch
with
it
she
pushed
him
away
with
the
side
of
her
foot
and
with
the
fish
head
in
his
teeth
retired
around
the
corner
of
the
house
by
the
rain
barrel
where
at
intervals
he
could
be
heard
growling
to
himself
in
a
key
pretending
the
approach
of
some
terrible
enemy
meanwhile
lloyd
already
well
on
her
way
was
having
an
exciting
tussle
with
rox
the
horse
had
begun
by
making
an
exhibition
of
himself
for
all
who
could
see
but
in
the
end
he
had
so
worked
upon
his
own
nerves
that
instead
of
frightening
others
he
only
succeeded
in
terrifying
himself
he
was
and
the
sudden
change
from
brick
houses
to
open
fields
had
demoralised
him
he
began
to
have
a
dim
consciousness
of
just
how
strong
he
was
there
was
nothing
vicious
about
him
he
would
not
have
lowered
himself
to
kick
but
he
did
want
with
all
the
big
strong
heart
of
him
to
run
but
back
of
him
there
he
felt
it
thrilling
along
the
reins
was
a
calm
powerful
grip
even
steady
masterful
turn
his
head
he
could
not
but
he
knew
very
well
that
lloyd
had
taken
a
double
twist
upon
the
reins
and
that
her
hands
even
if
they
were
gloved
in
white
were
strong
strong
enough
to
hold
him
to
his
work
and
besides
this
he
could
tell
it
by
the
very
feel
of
the
bit
he
knew
that
she
did
not
take
him
very
seriously
that
he
could
not
make
her
afraid
of
him
he
knew
that
she
could
tell
at
once
whether
he
shied
because
he
was
really
frightened
or
because
he
wanted
to
break
the
shaft
and
that
in
the
latter
case
he
would
get
the
whip
and
mercilessly
too
across
his
haunch
a
degradation
above
all
things
to
be
avoided
and
she
had
called
him
an
old
pig
once
already
that
morning
lloyd
drove
on
she
keenly
enjoyed
this
struggle
between
the
strength
and
her
own
determination
her
own
obstinacy
no
she
would
not
let
rox
have
his
way
she
would
not
allow
him
to
triumph
over
her
for
a
single
moment
she
would
neither
be
forced
nor
tricked
into
yielding
a
single
point
however
small
she
would
be
mistress
of
the
situation
by
the
end
of
half
an
hour
she
had
him
well
in
hand
and
was
bowling
smoothly
along
a
level
stretch
of
road
at
the
foot
of
an
abrupt
rise
of
land
covered
with
scrub
oak
and
broken
with
outcroppings
of
granite
of
a
curious
formation
just
beyond
here
the
road
crossed
the
canal
by
a
narrow
in
fact
a
much
too
narrow
plank
bridge
without
the
had
just
sufficient
room
on
either
hand
and
lloyd
too
good
a
whip
to
take
chances
with
so
nervous
a
horse
as
rox
drew
him
down
to
a
walk
as
she
approached
it
but
of
a
sudden
her
eyes
were
arrested
by
a
curious
sight
she
halted
the
cart
at
the
roadside
some
fifty
yards
from
the
plank
bridge
were
two
dogs
evidently
there
had
just
been
a
dreadful
fight
here
and
there
a
stone
was
streaked
with
blood
the
grass
and
smaller
bushes
were
flattened
out
and
tufts
of
hair
were
scattered
about
upon
the
ground
of
the
two
dogs
lloyd
recognised
one
upon
the
instant
it
was
dan
the
white
of
the
farmhouse
the
fighter
and
terror
of
the
country
but
he
was
lying
upon
his
side
now
the
foreleg
broken
or
rather
crushed
as
if
in
a
vise
the
throat
torn
open
the
in
a
great
pool
about
his
head
he
was
dead
or
in
the
very
throes
of
death
poor
dan
he
had
fought
his
last
fight
had
found
more
than
his
match
at
last
lloyd
looked
at
the
other
dog
the
victor
then
looked
at
him
a
second
time
and
a
third
well
she
murmured
that
a
dog
in
fact
he
was
a
curious
animal
his
broad
strong
body
was
covered
with
a
brown
fur
as
dense
as
thick
and
as
soft
as
a
wolf
the
ears
were
pricked
and
pointed
the
muzzle
sharp
the
eyes
slant
and
beady
the
breast
was
disproportionately
broad
the
forelegs
short
and
apparently
very
powerful
around
his
neck
was
a
broad
nickelled
collar
but
as
lloyd
sat
in
the
cart
watching
him
he
promptly
demonstrated
the
fact
that
his
nature
was
as
extraordinary
as
his
looks
he
turned
again
from
a
momentary
inspection
of
the
intruders
sniffed
once
or
twice
at
his
dead
enemy
then
suddenly
began
to
eat
him
lloyd
gorge
rose
with
anger
and
disgust
even
if
dan
had
been
killed
it
had
been
in
fair
fight
and
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
dan
himself
had
been
the
aggressor
she
could
even
feel
a
little
respect
for
the
conqueror
of
the
champion
but
to
turn
upon
the
dead
foe
now
that
the
heat
of
battle
was
past
and
in
no
spirit
of
hate
or
rage
deliberately
to
eat
him
what
a
horror
she
took
out
her
whip
shame
on
you
she
exclaimed
ugh
what
a
savage
i
sha
allow
you
a
was
coming
across
the
plank
bridge
and
as
he
drew
near
the
cart
lloyd
asked
him
to
hold
rox
for
a
moment
rox
was
one
of
those
horses
who
when
standing
still
are
docile
as
a
kitten
and
she
had
no
hesitancy
in
leaving
him
with
a
man
at
his
head
she
jumped
out
the
whip
in
her
hand
dan
was
beyond
all
help
but
she
wanted
at
least
to
take
his
collar
back
to
applegate
the
strange
dog
permitted
himself
to
be
driven
off
a
little
distance
part
of
his
strangeness
seemed
to
be
that
through
it
all
he
retained
a
certain
placidity
of
temper
there
was
no
ferocity
in
his
desire
to
eat
dan
that
just
what
makes
it
so
disgusting
said
lloyd
shaking
her
whip
at
him
he
sat
down
upon
his
haunches
eyeing
her
calmly
his
tongue
lolling
when
she
had
unbuckled
dan
collar
and
tossed
it
into
the
cart
under
the
seat
she
inquired
of
the
as
to
where
the
new
dog
came
from
it
beats
me
miss
searight
he
answered
never
saw
such
a
bird
in
these
parts
before
belongs
down
to
applegate
come
let
have
a
look
at
you
said
lloyd
putting
back
the
whip
let
me
see
your
collar
disregarding
the
man
warning
she
went
up
to
the
stranger
whistling
and
holding
out
her
hand
and
he
came
up
to
her
a
little
suspiciously
at
first
but
in
the
end
wagging
his
tail
willing
to
be
friendly
lloyd
parted
the
thick
fur
around
his
neck
and
turned
the
plate
of
the
collar
to
the
light
on
the
plate
was
engraved
kamiska
arctic
return
to
ward
bennett
anything
on
the
collar
asked
the
man
lloyd
settled
a
hairpin
in
a
coil
of
hair
at
the
back
of
her
neck
nothing
nothing
that
i
can
make
out
she
climbed
into
the
cart
again
and
dismissed
the
with
a
quarter
he
disappeared
around
the
turn
of
the
road
but
as
she
was
about
to
drive
on
lloyd
heard
a
great
clattering
of
stones
upon
the
hill
above
her
a
crashing
in
the
bushes
and
a
shrill
whistle
thrice
repeated
kamiska
started
up
at
once
cocking
alternate
ears
then
turned
about
and
ran
up
the
hill
to
meet
ward
bennett
who
came
scrambling
down
jumping
from
one
granite
outcrop
to
another
holding
on
the
whiles
by
the
lower
branches
of
the
scrub
he
was
dressed
as
if
for
an
outing
in
knickerbockers
and
huge
shoes
he
wore
an
old
and
a
woollen
cap
a
little
leather
sack
was
slung
from
his
shoulder
and
in
his
hand
he
carried
a
geologist
hammer
and
then
after
so
long
a
time
lloyd
saw
his
face
again
the
rugged
unhandsome
face
the
massive
jaw
huge
almost
to
deformity
the
great
brutal
indomitable
lips
the
chin
with
its
forward
aggressive
thrust
the
narrow
forehead
seamed
and
contracted
and
the
twinkling
keen
eyes
so
marred
by
the
cast
so
heavily
shadowed
by
the
shaggy
eyebrows
when
he
spoke
the
voice
came
heavy
and
vibrant
from
the
great
chest
a
harsh
deep
bass
a
voice
in
which
to
command
men
not
a
voice
in
which
to
talk
to
women
lloyd
long
schooled
to
and
the
control
of
her
emotions
when
such
repression
and
control
were
necessary
sat
absolutely
moveless
on
her
high
seat
her
hands
only
shutting
tighter
and
tighter
upon
the
reins
she
had
often
wondered
how
she
would
feel
what
was
to
be
her
dominant
impulse
at
such
moments
as
these
and
now
she
realised
that
it
was
not
so
much
joy
not
so
much
excitement
as
a
resolute
determination
not
for
one
instant
to
lose
her
poise
she
was
thinking
rapidly
for
four
years
they
had
not
met
at
one
time
she
believed
him
to
be
dead
but
in
the
end
he
had
been
saved
had
come
back
and
ignoring
the
plaudits
of
an
entire
christendom
had
addressed
himself
straight
to
her
for
one
of
them
at
least
this
meeting
was
a
crisis
what
would
they
first
say
to
each
other
how
be
equal
to
the
situation
how
rise
to
its
dramatic
possibilities
but
the
moment
had
come
to
them
suddenly
had
found
them
all
unprepared
there
was
no
time
to
think
of
adequate
words
afterward
when
she
reviewed
this
encounter
she
told
herself
that
they
both
had
failed
and
that
if
the
meeting
had
been
faithfully
reproduced
upon
the
stage
or
in
the
pages
of
a
novel
it
would
have
seemed
tame
and
commonplace
these
two
living
the
actual
scene
with
all
the
deep
strong
real
emotions
of
them
surging
to
the
surface
the
vitality
of
them
all
aroused
and
vibrating
suddenly
confronting
actuality
itself
were
not
even
natural
were
not
even
true
to
life
it
was
as
though
they
had
parted
but
a
fortnight
ago
bennett
caught
his
cap
from
his
head
and
came
toward
her
exclaiming
miss
searight
i
believe
and
she
reaching
her
right
hand
over
the
left
that
still
held
the
reins
leaned
from
her
high
seat
shaking
hands
with
him
and
replying
well
bennett
i
so
very
glad
to
see
you
again
where
did
you
come
from
from
the
city
and
from
degrees
north
latitude
i
congratulate
you
we
had
almost
given
up
hope
of
you
thank
you
he
answered
we
were
not
so
roseate
with
hope
ourselves
all
the
time
but
i
have
not
felt
as
though
i
had
really
come
back
until
this
well
until
i
had
reached
the
road
between
bannister
and
fourth
lake
for
instance
and
his
face
relaxed
to
its
characteristic
grim
smile
you
reached
it
too
late
then
she
responded
your
dog
has
killed
our
dan
and
what
is
much
worse
started
to
eat
him
he
a
perfect
savage
kamiska
well
he
added
reflectively
it
my
fault
for
setting
her
a
bad
example
i
ate
her
and
was
rather
close
to
eating
kamiska
herself
at
one
time
but
i
did
come
down
here
to
talk
about
that
you
are
looking
rather
worn
mr
bennett
i
suppose
the
doctor
sent
me
into
the
country
to
call
back
the
roses
to
my
pallid
cheek
so
i
came
down
here
to
geologise
i
presume
that
excuse
will
do
as
well
as
another
then
suddenly
he
cried
hello
steady
there
miss
searight
it
all
came
so
abruptly
that
neither
of
them
could
afterward
reconstruct
the
scene
with
any
degree
of
accuracy
probably
in
scrambling
down
the
steep
slope
of
the
bank
bennett
had
loosened
the
earth
or
smaller
stones
that
hitherto
had
been
barely
sufficient
support
to
the
mass
of
earth
gravel
rocks
and
bushes
that
all
at
once
and
with
a
sharp
crackling
noise
slid
downward
toward
the
road
from
the
overhanging
bank
the
slip
was
small
hardly
more
than
three
square
yards
of
earth
moving
from
its
place
but
it
came
with
a
smart
quick
rush
throwing
up
a
cloud
of
dust
and
scattering
pebbles
and
hard
clods
of
dirt
far
before
its
advance
as
rox
leaped
lloyd
threw
her
weight
too
suddenly
on
the
reins
the
horse
arched
his
neck
and
the
overhead
check
snapped
like
a
again
he
reared
from
the
object
of
his
terror
shaking
his
head
from
side
to
side
trying
to
get
a
purchase
on
the
bit
then
his
lower
jaw
settled
against
his
chest
and
all
at
once
he
realised
that
no
pair
of
human
hands
could
hold
him
now
he
did
not
rear
again
his
haunches
suddenly
lowered
and
with
the
hoofs
of
his
hind
feet
he
began
feeling
the
ground
for
his
spring
but
now
bennett
was
at
his
head
gripping
at
the
bit
striving
to
thrust
him
back
lloyd
half
risen
from
her
seat
each
rein
wrapped
twice
around
her
hands
her
long
strong
arms
at
their
fullest
reach
held
back
against
the
horse
with
all
her
might
her
body
swaying
and
jerking
with
his
plunges
but
the
overhead
check
once
broken
lloyd
might
as
well
have
pulled
against
a
locomotive
bennett
was
a
powerful
man
by
nature
but
his
great
strength
had
been
not
a
little
sapped
by
his
recent
experiences
between
the
instant
his
hand
caught
at
the
bit
and
that
in
which
rox
had
made
his
first
ineffectual
attempt
to
spring
forward
he
recognised
the
inequality
of
the
contest
he
could
hold
rox
back
for
a
second
or
two
perhaps
three
then
the
horse
would
get
away
from
him
he
shot
a
glance
about
him
not
twenty
yards
away
was
the
canal
and
the
perilously
narrow
bridge
the
bridge
without
the
quick
miss
searight
he
shouted
jump
we
ca
hold
him
quick
do
as
i
tell
you
jump
but
even
as
he
spoke
rox
dragged
him
from
his
feet
his
hoofs
trampling
the
hollow
road
till
it
reverberated
like
the
roll
of
drums
bracing
himself
against
every
unevenness
of
the
ground
his
teeth
set
his
face
scarlet
the
veins
in
his
neck
swelling
suddenly
bennett
wrenched
at
the
bit
till
the
horse
mouth
went
bloody
but
all
to
no
purpose
faster
and
faster
rox
was
escaping
from
his
control
jump
i
tell
you
he
shouted
again
looking
over
his
shoulder
another
second
and
he
away
lloyd
dropped
the
reins
and
turned
to
jump
but
the
had
slipped
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
cart
when
she
had
risen
and
was
in
a
tangle
about
her
feet
the
cart
was
rocking
like
a
ship
in
a
storm
twice
she
tried
to
free
herself
holding
to
the
dashboard
with
one
hand
then
the
cart
suddenly
lurched
forward
and
she
fell
to
her
knees
rox
was
off
it
was
all
over
not
quite
in
one
brief
second
of
time
a
hideous
vision
come
and
gone
between
two
breaths
lloyd
saw
the
fearful
thing
done
there
in
the
road
almost
within
reach
of
her
hand
she
saw
the
man
and
horse
at
grapples
the
yellow
reach
of
road
that
lay
between
her
and
the
canal
the
canal
itself
and
the
narrow
bridge
then
she
saw
the
geologist
hammer
gripped
in
bennett
fist
heave
high
in
the
air
down
it
came
swift
resistless
terrible
one
blow
the
cart
tipped
forward
as
rox
his
knees
bowing
from
under
him
slowly
collapsed
then
he
rolled
upon
the
shaft
that
snapped
under
him
and
the
cart
vibrated
from
end
to
end
as
a
long
shuddering
tremble
ran
through
him
with
his
last
deep
breath
when
lloyd
at
length
managed
to
free
herself
and
jump
to
the
ground
bennett
came
quickly
toward
her
and
drew
her
away
to
the
side
of
the
road
are
you
hurt
he
demanded
tell
me
are
you
hurt
no
no
not
in
the
least
why
in
the
world
did
you
want
to
drive
such
a
horse
do
ever
take
such
chances
again
i
wo
have
it
for
a
few
moments
lloyd
was
too
excited
to
trust
herself
to
talk
and
could
only
stand
helplessly
to
one
side
watching
bennett
as
he
stripped
off
the
harness
from
the
dead
horse
stowed
it
away
under
the
seat
of
the
cart
and
rolled
the
cart
itself
to
the
edge
of
the
road
then
at
length
she
said
trying
to
smile
and
to
steady
her
voice
it
it
seems
to
me
bennett
you
do
about
about
as
you
like
with
my
sit
down
he
commanded
you
are
trembling
all
over
sit
down
on
that
rock
there
and
with
me
she
added
sinking
down
upon
the
boulder
he
had
indicated
with
a
movement
of
his
head
his
hands
busy
with
the
harness
i
sorry
i
had
to
do
that
he
explained
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
nothing
else
to
do
he
would
have
had
you
in
the
canal
in
another
second
if
he
did
not
kill
you
on
the
way
there
poor
old
rox
murmured
lloyd
i
was
very
fond
of
rox
bennett
put
himself
in
her
way
as
she
stepped
forward
he
had
the
over
his
arm
and
the
whip
in
his
hand
no
do
look
at
him
he
not
a
pretty
sight
come
shall
i
take
you
home
do
worry
about
the
cart
i
will
see
that
it
is
sent
back
and
that
rox
is
buried
somewhere
i
do
want
him
left
out
there
for
the
crows
in
spite
of
bennett
injunction
she
looked
over
her
shoulder
for
a
moment
as
they
started
off
down
the
road
i
only
hope
you
were
sure
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
bennett
she
said
there
was
no
time
to
think
he
answered
and
i
was
taking
any
chances
but
the
savagery
of
the
whole
affair
stuck
in
lloyd
imagination
there
was
a
primitiveness
a
certain
hideous
simplicity
in
the
way
bennett
had
met
the
situation
that
filled
her
with
wonder
and
with
even
a
little
terror
and
mistrust
of
him
the
vast
brutal
directness
of
the
deed
was
out
of
place
and
incongruous
at
this
time
it
ignored
two
thousand
years
of
civilisation
it
was
a
harsh
clanging
brazen
note
powerful
uncomplicated
which
came
jangling
in
discordant
and
inharmonious
with
the
tune
of
the
age
it
savoured
of
the
days
when
men
fought
the
brutes
with
their
hands
or
with
their
clubs
but
also
it
was
an
indication
of
a
force
and
a
power
of
mind
that
stopped
at
nothing
to
attain
its
ends
that
chose
the
shortest
cut
the
most
direct
means
disdainful
of
hesitation
holding
delicacy
and
finessing
in
measureless
contempt
rushing
straight
to
its
object
driving
in
breaking
down
resistance
smashing
through
obstacles
with
a
boundless
crude
blind
brobdignag
power
to
oppose
which
was
to
be
trampled
under
foot
upon
the
instant
it
was
long
before
their
talk
turned
from
the
incident
of
the
morning
but
when
it
did
its
subject
was
richard
ferriss
bennett
was
sounding
his
praises
and
commending
upon
his
pluck
and
endurance
during
the
retreat
from
the
ship
when
lloyd
after
hesitating
once
or
twice
asked
how
is
ferriss
in
your
note
you
said
he
was
so
he
is
he
told
her
and
i
could
not
have
left
him
if
i
was
not
sure
i
was
doing
him
harm
by
staying
but
the
doctor
is
to
wire
me
if
he
gets
any
worse
and
only
if
he
does
i
am
to
believe
that
no
news
is
good
news
but
this
meeting
with
lloyd
and
the
intense
excitement
of
those
few
moments
by
the
canal
had
quite
driven
from
bennett
mind
the
fact
that
he
had
forwarded
his
present
address
either
to
ferriss
or
to
his
doctor
he
had
so
intended
that
morning
but
all
the
faculties
of
his
mind
were
suddenly
concentrated
upon
another
issue
for
the
moment
he
believed
that
he
had
actually
written
to
pitts
as
he
had
planned
and
when
he
thought
of
his
intended
message
at
all
thought
of
it
as
an
accomplished
fact
the
matter
did
not
occur
to
him
again
as
he
walked
by
lloyd
side
listening
to
her
and
talking
to
her
snapping
the
whip
the
while
or
flicking
the
heads
from
the
mullein
stalks
by
the
roadside
with
its
lash
he
was
thinking
how
best
he
might
say
to
her
what
he
had
come
from
the
city
to
say
to
lead
up
to
his
subject
to
guide
the
conversation
to
prepare
the
right
psychological
moment
skilfully
and
without
apparent
effort
were
maneuvers
in
the
game
that
bennett
ignored
and
despised
he
knew
only
that
he
loved
her
that
she
was
there
at
his
side
that
the
object
of
all
his
desires
and
hopes
was
within
his
reach
straight
as
a
homing
pigeon
he
went
to
his
goal
miss
searight
he
began
his
harsh
bass
voice
pitched
even
lower
than
usual
what
do
you
think
i
am
down
here
for
this
is
not
the
only
part
of
the
world
where
i
could
recuperate
i
suppose
and
as
for
spending
god
day
in
chipping
at
stones
like
a
professor
of
a
young
seminary
he
hurled
the
hammer
from
him
into
the
bushes
that
for
geology
now
we
can
talk
you
know
very
well
that
i
love
you
and
i
believe
that
you
love
me
i
have
come
down
here
to
ask
you
to
marry
me
lloyd
might
have
done
any
one
of
a
dozen
things
might
have
answered
in
any
one
of
a
dozen
ways
but
what
she
did
do
what
she
did
say
took
bennett
completely
by
surprise
a
little
coldly
and
very
calmly
she
answered
you
believe
you
say
you
believe
that
i
she
broke
off
then
began
again
it
is
not
right
for
you
to
say
that
to
me
i
have
never
led
you
to
believe
that
i
cared
for
you
whatever
our
relations
are
to
be
let
us
have
that
understood
at
once
bennett
uttered
an
impatient
exclamation
i
am
not
good
at
fencing
and
quibbling
he
declared
i
tell
you
that
i
love
you
with
all
my
heart
i
tell
you
that
i
want
you
to
be
my
wife
and
i
tell
you
that
i
know
you
do
love
me
you
are
not
like
other
women
why
should
you
coquette
with
me
good
god
are
you
not
big
enough
to
be
above
such
things
i
know
you
are
of
all
the
people
in
the
world
we
two
ought
to
be
above
pretence
ought
to
understand
each
other
if
i
did
not
know
you
cared
for
me
i
would
not
have
spoken
i
do
understand
you
she
answered
i
think
we
had
better
talk
of
other
things
this
morning
i
came
down
here
to
talk
of
just
this
and
nothing
else
he
declared
very
well
then
she
said
squaring
her
shoulders
with
a
quick
brisk
movement
we
will
talk
of
it
you
say
we
two
should
understand
each
other
let
us
come
to
the
bottom
of
things
at
once
i
despise
quibbling
and
fencing
as
much
perhaps
as
you
tell
me
how
have
i
ever
led
you
to
believe
that
i
cared
for
you
at
a
time
when
our
last
hope
was
gone
answered
bennett
meeting
her
eyes
when
i
was
very
near
to
death
and
thought
that
i
should
go
to
my
god
within
the
day
i
was
made
happier
than
i
think
i
ever
was
in
my
life
before
by
finding
out
that
i
was
dear
to
you
that
you
loved
me
lloyd
searched
his
face
with
a
look
of
surprise
and
bewilderment
i
do
not
understand
you
she
repeated
oh
exclaimed
bennett
with
sudden
vehemence
you
could
say
it
to
ferriss
why
ca
you
say
it
to
me
to
mr
ferriss
you
could
tell
that
you
cared
i
tell
ferriss
that
i
cared
for
you
she
began
to
smile
you
are
a
little
absurd
mr
bennett
and
i
can
not
see
why
you
should
deny
it
now
or
if
anything
has
caused
you
to
change
your
mind
to
be
sorry
for
what
you
said
why
should
i
not
know
it
even
a
petty
thief
may
be
heard
in
his
own
defence
i
loved
you
because
i
believed
you
to
be
a
woman
a
great
strong
noble
woman
above
little
things
above
the
little
niggling
contemptible
devices
of
the
i
loved
you
because
the
great
things
of
the
world
interested
you
because
you
had
no
place
in
your
life
for
petty
graces
petty
affectations
petty
deceits
and
shams
and
insincerities
if
you
did
not
love
me
why
did
you
say
so
if
you
do
love
me
now
why
should
you
not
admit
it
do
you
think
you
can
play
with
me
do
you
think
you
can
coquette
with
me
if
you
were
small
enough
to
stoop
to
such
means
do
you
think
i
am
small
enough
to
submit
to
them
i
have
known
ferriss
too
well
i
know
him
to
be
incapable
of
such
falsity
as
you
would
charge
him
with
to
have
told
such
a
lie
such
an
useless
gratuitous
lie
is
a
thing
he
could
not
have
done
you
must
have
told
him
that
you
cared
why
are
you
you
of
all
women
brave
enough
strong
enough
big
enough
to
stand
by
your
words
because
i
never
said
them
what
do
you
think
of
me
even
if
i
did
care
do
you
suppose
i
would
say
as
much
and
to
another
man
oh
she
exclaimed
with
sudden
indignation
let
talk
of
something
else
this
is
too
preposterous
you
never
told
ferriss
that
you
cared
for
me
no
bennett
took
off
his
cap
very
well
then
that
is
enough
miss
searight
do
you
believe
i
told
ferriss
i
loved
you
i
do
not
believe
that
the
man
who
has
been
more
to
me
than
a
brother
is
a
liar
and
a
rascal
mr
bennett
they
had
come
rather
near
to
the
farmhouse
by
this
time
without
another
word
bennett
gave
the
whip
and
the
into
her
hands
and
turning
upon
his
heel
walked
away
down
the
road
lloyd
told
lewis
as
much
of
the
morning
accident
by
the
canal
as
was
necessary
and
gave
orders
about
the
and
the
burying
of
rox
then
slowly
her
eyes
fixed
and
wide
she
went
up
to
her
own
room
and
without
removing
either
her
hat
or
her
gloves
sat
down
upon
the
edge
of
the
bed
letting
her
hands
fall
limply
into
her
lap
gazing
abstractedly
at
the
white
curtain
just
stirring
at
the
open
window
she
could
not
say
which
hurt
her
most
that
ferriss
had
told
the
lie
or
that
bennett
believed
it
but
why
in
heaven
name
why
had
ferriss
so
spoken
to
bennett
what
object
had
he
in
view
what
had
he
to
gain
by
it
why
had
ferriss
the
man
who
loved
her
chosen
so
to
humiliate
her
to
put
her
in
a
position
so
galling
to
her
pride
her
dignity
bennett
too
loved
her
how
could
he
believe
that
she
had
so
demeaned
herself
she
had
been
hurt
and
to
the
heart
at
a
point
where
she
believed
herself
most
unassailable
and
he
who
held
the
weapon
was
the
man
that
with
all
the
heart
of
her
and
soul
of
her
she
loved
much
of
the
situation
was
all
beyond
her
try
as
she
would
she
could
not
understand
one
thing
however
she
saw
clearly
unmistakably
bennett
believed
that
she
loved
him
believed
that
she
had
told
as
much
to
ferriss
and
that
when
she
had
denied
all
knowledge
of
ferriss
lie
she
was
only
coquetting
with
him
she
knew
bennett
and
his
character
well
enough
to
realise
that
an
idea
once
rooted
in
his
mind
was
all
but
ineradicable
bennett
was
not
a
man
of
easy
changes
nothing
mobile
about
him
the
thought
of
this
belief
of
bennett
was
intolerable
as
she
sat
there
alone
in
her
white
room
the
dull
crimson
of
her
cheeks
flamed
suddenly
scarlet
and
with
a
quick
involuntary
gesture
she
threw
her
hand
palm
outward
across
her
face
to
hide
it
from
the
sunlight
she
went
quickly
from
one
mood
to
another
now
her
anger
grew
suddenly
hot
against
ferriss
how
had
he
dared
how
had
he
dared
to
put
this
indignity
this
outrageous
insult
upon
her
now
her
wrath
turned
upon
bennett
what
audacity
had
been
his
to
believe
that
she
would
so
forget
herself
she
set
her
teeth
in
her
impotent
anger
rising
to
her
feet
her
hands
clenching
tears
of
sheer
passion
starting
to
her
eyes
for
the
greater
part
of
the
afternoon
she
kept
to
her
room
pacing
the
floor
from
wall
to
wall
trying
to
think
clearly
to
resolve
upon
something
that
would
readjust
the
situation
that
would
give
her
back
her
peace
of
mind
her
dignity
and
her
happiness
of
the
early
morning
for
now
the
great
joy
that
had
come
to
her
in
his
safe
return
was
all
but
gone
for
one
moment
she
even
told
herself
she
could
not
love
him
but
the
next
was
willing
to
admit
that
it
was
only
because
of
her
love
of
him
as
strong
and
deep
as
ever
that
the
humiliation
cut
so
deeply
and
cruelly
now
ferriss
had
lied
about
her
and
bennett
had
believed
the
lie
to
meet
bennett
again
under
such
circumstances
was
not
to
be
thought
of
for
one
moment
her
vacation
was
spoiled
the
charm
of
the
country
had
vanished
lloyd
returned
to
the
city
the
next
day
she
found
that
she
was
glad
to
get
back
to
her
work
the
subdued
murmur
of
the
city
that
hourly
assaulted
her
windows
was
a
relief
to
her
ears
after
the
profound
and
numbing
silence
of
the
country
the
square
was
never
so
beautiful
as
at
this
time
of
summer
and
even
the
restless
shadow
pictures
that
after
dark
were
thrown
upon
the
ceiling
of
her
room
by
the
electrics
shining
through
the
great
elms
in
the
square
below
were
a
pleasure
on
the
morning
after
her
arrival
and
as
she
was
unpacking
her
trunk
miss
douglass
came
into
her
room
and
seated
herself
according
to
her
custom
on
the
couch
after
some
talk
the
fever
nurse
said
do
you
remember
lloyd
what
i
told
you
about
typhoid
in
the
spring
that
it
was
almost
epidemic
lloyd
nodded
turning
about
from
her
trunk
her
arms
full
of
dresses
it
worse
than
ever
now
continued
miss
douglass
three
of
our
people
have
been
on
cases
only
in
the
short
time
you
have
been
away
and
there
a
case
out
in
medford
that
has
killed
one
nurse
well
exclaimed
lloyd
in
some
astonishment
it
seems
to
me
that
one
should
confine
typhoid
easily
enough
not
always
not
always
answered
the
other
a
virulent
case
would
be
quite
as
bad
as
yellow
fever
or
smallpox
you
remember
when
we
were
at
the
hospital
miss
helmuth
that
little
polish
nurse
contracted
it
from
her
case
and
died
even
before
her
patient
did
then
there
was
eva
blayne
she
very
nearly
died
i
did
like
the
way
miss
wakeley
took
this
case
out
at
medford
even
when
the
other
nurse
had
died
she
never
hesitated
for
has
one
of
our
people
got
this
case
inquired
lloyd
of
course
did
i
tell
you
i
hope
we
cure
it
said
lloyd
her
in
her
hands
i
think
we
have
ever
lost
a
case
yet
when
good
nursing
could
pull
it
through
and
in
typhoid
the
whole
treatment
really
is
the
nursing
lloyd
said
miss
douglass
decisively
i
would
give
anything
i
can
think
of
now
to
have
been
on
that
hip
disease
case
of
yours
and
have
brought
my
patient
through
as
you
did
you
should
hear
what
street
says
of
you
and
the
little
girl
father
by
the
way
i
had
nearly
forgotten
hattie
campbell
that
her
name
is
it
telephoned
to
know
if
you
had
come
back
from
the
country
yet
that
was
yesterday
i
said
we
expected
you
and
she
told
me
to
say
she
was
coming
to
see
you
the
next
afternoon
toward
three
hattie
and
her
father
drove
to
the
square
in
an
open
carriage
hattie
carrying
a
great
bunch
of
violets
for
lloyd
the
little
invalid
was
well
on
the
way
to
complete
recovery
by
now
sometimes
she
was
allowed
to
walk
a
little
but
as
often
as
not
her
maid
wheeled
her
about
in
an
invalid
chair
she
drove
out
in
the
carriage
frequently
by
way
of
exercise
she
would
no
doubt
always
limp
a
little
but
in
the
end
it
was
certain
she
would
be
sound
and
strong
for
hattie
and
her
father
lloyd
had
become
a
sort
of
tutelary
in
what
was
left
of
the
family
she
had
her
place
hardly
less
revered
than
even
the
dead
wife
campbell
himself
who
had
made
a
fortune
in
bessemer
steel
a
gentleman
and
with
hair
that
was
none
too
gray
more
than
once
caught
himself
standing
before
lloyd
picture
that
stood
on
the
mantelpiece
in
hattie
room
looking
at
it
vaguely
as
he
clipped
the
nib
from
his
cigar
but
on
this
occasion
as
the
carriage
stopped
in
front
of
the
ample
pile
of
the
house
hattie
called
out
oh
there
she
is
now
and
lloyd
came
down
the
steps
carrying
her
nurse
bag
in
her
hand
are
we
too
late
began
hattie
are
you
going
out
are
you
on
a
case
is
that
why
you
got
your
bag
we
thought
you
were
on
a
vacation
campbell
yielding
to
a
certain
feeling
of
uneasiness
that
lloyd
should
stand
on
the
curb
while
he
remained
seated
got
out
of
the
carriage
and
stood
at
her
side
gravely
listening
to
the
talk
between
the
nurse
and
her
patient
lloyd
was
obliged
to
explain
turning
now
to
hattie
now
to
her
father
she
told
them
that
she
was
in
something
of
a
hurry
she
had
just
been
specially
called
to
take
a
very
bad
case
of
typhoid
fever
in
a
little
suburb
of
the
city
called
medford
it
was
not
her
turn
to
go
but
the
physicians
in
charge
of
the
case
as
sometimes
happened
had
asked
especially
for
her
one
of
our
people
a
young
woman
named
miss
wakeley
has
been
on
this
case
she
continued
but
it
seems
she
has
allowed
herself
to
contract
the
disease
herself
she
went
to
the
hospital
this
noon
campbell
his
gravity
suddenly
broken
up
exclaimed
surely
miss
searight
this
is
not
the
same
case
i
read
of
in
yesterday
paper
it
must
be
too
medford
was
the
name
of
the
place
that
case
has
killed
one
nurse
already
and
now
the
second
one
is
down
do
tell
me
you
are
going
to
take
the
same
case
it
is
the
same
case
answered
lloyd
and
of
course
i
am
going
to
take
it
did
you
ever
hear
of
a
nurse
doing
otherwise
why
it
would
seem
seem
so
funny
there
was
no
dissuading
her
and
campbell
and
hattie
soon
ceased
even
to
try
she
was
impatient
to
be
gone
the
station
was
close
at
hand
and
she
would
not
hear
of
taking
the
carriage
thither
however
before
she
left
them
she
recurred
again
to
the
subject
of
her
letter
to
campbell
and
then
and
there
it
was
decided
that
hattie
and
her
maid
should
spend
the
following
ten
days
at
lloyd
place
in
bannister
the
still
country
air
now
that
hattie
was
able
to
take
the
short
journey
would
be
more
to
her
than
many
medicines
and
the
ponies
and
phaeton
would
be
left
there
with
lewis
for
her
use
and
write
often
wo
you
miss
searight
exclaimed
hattie
as
lloyd
was
saying
lloyd
shook
her
head
not
that
of
all
things
she
answered
if
i
did
that
we
might
have
you
too
down
with
typhoid
but
you
may
write
to
me
and
i
hope
you
will
and
she
gave
hattie
her
new
address
harriet
said
campbell
as
the
carriage
drove
back
across
the
square
the
father
and
daughter
waving
their
hands
to
lloyd
briskly
on
her
way
to
the
railroad
station
harriet
yes
papa
there
goes
a
noble
woman
pluck
intelligence
strong
will
she
has
them
all
and
a
great
big
heart
that
heart
that
he
clipped
the
end
of
a
cigar
thoughtfully
and
fell
silent
a
day
or
two
later
as
hattie
was
sitting
in
her
little
on
the
veranda
of
applegate
house
watching
hunting
grasshoppers
underneath
the
currant
bushes
she
was
surprised
by
the
sharp
closing
of
the
front
gate
a
huge
man
with
one
squint
eye
and
a
heavy
jaw
was
coming
up
the
walk
followed
by
a
dog
withdrew
swiftly
to
his
particular
hole
under
the
veranda
moving
rapidly
his
body
low
to
the
ground
and
taking
an
unnecessary
number
of
very
short
steps
the
little
girl
distinguished
the
visitor
from
a
country
man
at
once
hattie
had
ideas
of
her
own
as
to
propriety
and
so
rose
to
her
feet
as
bennett
came
up
and
after
a
moment
hesitation
made
him
a
little
bow
bennett
at
once
gravely
took
off
his
cap
excuse
me
he
said
as
though
hattie
were
instead
of
twelve
is
miss
searight
at
home
oh
exclaimed
hattie
delighted
do
you
know
miss
searight
she
was
my
nurse
when
i
was
so
sick
because
you
know
i
had
hip
disease
and
there
was
an
operation
no
she
not
here
any
more
she
gone
away
gone
back
to
the
city
gone
back
to
the
city
yes
three
or
four
days
ago
but
i
going
to
write
to
her
this
afternoon
shall
i
say
who
called
then
without
waiting
for
a
reply
she
added
i
guess
i
had
better
introduce
myself
my
name
is
harriet
campbell
and
my
papa
is
craig
campbell
of
the
hercules
wrought
steel
company
in
the
city
wo
you
have
a
chair
the
little
convalescent
and
the
arctic
explorer
shook
hands
with
great
solemnity
i
so
pleased
to
meet
you
said
bennett
i
have
a
card
but
my
name
is
ward
bennett
of
the
freja
expedition
he
added
but
to
his
relief
the
little
girl
had
not
heard
of
him
very
well
she
said
i
tell
miss
searight
bennett
called
no
he
replied
hesitatingly
no
you
need
do
that
why
she
wo
answer
my
letter
you
know
explained
hattie
because
she
is
afraid
her
letters
would
give
me
typhoid
fever
that
they
might
she
continued
carefully
hazarding
a
remembered
phrase
carry
the
contagion
you
see
she
has
gone
to
nurse
a
dreadful
case
of
typhoid
fever
out
at
medford
near
the
city
and
we
so
worried
and
anxious
about
her
papa
and
i
one
nurse
that
had
this
case
has
died
already
and
another
one
has
caught
the
disease
and
is
very
sick
and
miss
searight
though
she
knew
just
how
dangerous
it
was
would
go
just
like
like
hattie
hesitated
then
confused
memories
of
her
school
reader
coming
to
her
finished
with
like
casabianca
oh
said
bennett
turning
his
head
so
as
to
fix
her
with
his
own
good
eye
she
has
gone
to
nurse
a
typhoid
fever
patient
has
she
yes
and
papa
told
me
and
hattie
became
suddenly
very
grave
that
we
might
might
oh
dear
never
see
her
again
hum
whereabouts
is
this
place
in
medford
she
gave
you
her
address
what
is
it
hattie
told
him
and
he
took
himself
abruptly
away
bennett
had
gone
some
little
distance
down
the
road
before
the
real
shock
came
upon
him
lloyd
was
in
a
position
of
imminent
peril
her
life
was
in
the
issue
with
blind
unreasoned
directness
he
leaped
at
once
to
this
conclusion
and
as
he
strode
along
with
teeth
and
fists
tight
shut
he
kept
muttering
to
himself
she
may
die
she
may
die
we
we
may
never
see
her
again
then
suddenly
came
the
fear
the
sickening
sink
of
heart
the
choke
at
the
throat
first
the
tightening
and
then
the
sudden
relaxing
of
all
the
nerves
lashed
and
harried
by
the
sense
of
a
fearful
calamity
an
unspeakable
grief
that
was
pursuing
after
him
bennett
did
not
stop
to
think
to
reflect
he
chose
instantly
to
believe
that
lloyd
was
near
her
death
and
once
the
idea
was
fixed
in
his
brain
it
was
not
thereafter
to
be
reasoned
away
suddenly
at
a
turn
in
the
road
he
stopped
his
hands
deep
in
his
pockets
his
bootheel
digging
into
the
ground
now
then
he
exclaimed
what
to
be
done
just
one
thing
lloyd
must
leave
the
case
at
once
that
very
day
if
it
were
possible
he
must
save
her
must
turn
her
back
from
this
destruction
toward
which
she
was
rushing
impelled
by
such
a
foolish
mistaken
notion
of
duty
yes
he
said
there
just
that
to
be
done
and
by
god
it
shall
be
done
but
would
lloyd
be
turned
back
from
a
course
she
had
chosen
for
herself
could
he
persuade
her
then
with
this
thought
of
possible
opposition
bennett
resolve
all
at
once
tightened
to
the
sticking
point
never
in
the
darkest
hours
of
his
struggle
with
the
arctic
ice
had
his
determination
grown
so
fierce
never
had
his
resolution
so
girded
itself
so
nerved
itself
to
crush
down
resistance
the
force
of
his
will
seemed
brusquely
to
be
quadrupled
and
decupled
he
would
do
as
he
desired
come
what
might
he
would
gain
his
end
he
would
stop
at
nothing
hesitate
at
nothing
it
would
probably
be
difficult
to
get
her
from
her
post
but
with
all
his
giant
strength
bennett
set
himself
to
gain
her
safety
a
great
point
that
he
believed
was
in
his
favour
a
consideration
that
influenced
him
to
adopt
so
irrevocable
a
resolution
was
his
belief
that
lloyd
loved
him
bennett
was
not
a
woman
man
men
he
could
understand
and
handle
like
so
many
manikins
but
the
nature
of
his
life
and
work
did
not
conduce
to
a
knowledge
of
women
bennett
did
not
understand
them
in
his
interview
with
lloyd
when
she
had
so
strenuously
denied
ferriss
story
bennett
could
not
catch
the
ring
of
truth
it
had
gotten
into
his
mind
that
lloyd
loved
him
he
believed
easily
what
he
wanted
to
believe
and
his
faith
in
lloyd
love
for
him
had
become
a
part
and
parcel
of
his
fundamental
idea
of
things
not
readily
to
be
driven
out
even
by
lloyd
herself
bennett
resolution
was
taken
never
had
he
failed
in
accomplishing
that
upon
which
he
set
his
mind
he
would
not
fail
now
beyond
a
certain
limit
a
limit
which
now
he
swiftly
reached
and
passed
determination
to
carry
his
point
became
as
it
were
a
sort
of
obsession
the
sweep
of
the
tremendous
power
he
unchained
carried
his
own
self
along
with
it
in
its
resistless
onrush
at
such
times
there
was
no
light
of
reason
in
his
actions
he
saw
only
his
point
beheld
only
his
goal
deaf
to
all
voices
that
would
call
him
back
blind
to
all
consideration
that
would
lead
him
to
swerve
reckless
of
everything
that
he
trampled
under
foot
he
stuck
to
his
aim
until
that
aim
was
an
accomplished
fact
when
the
grip
of
the
ice
had
threatened
to
close
upon
him
and
crush
him
he
had
hurled
himself
against
its
barriers
with
an
energy
and
resolve
to
conquer
that
was
little
short
of
directed
frenzy
so
it
was
with
him
now
when
lloyd
had
parted
from
the
campbells
in
the
square
before
the
house
she
had
gone
directly
to
the
railway
station
of
a
suburban
line
and
within
the
hour
was
on
her
way
to
medford
as
always
happened
when
an
interesting
case
was
to
be
treated
her
mind
became
gradually
filled
with
it
to
the
exclusion
of
everything
else
the
campbells
and
bennett
ready
acceptance
of
a
story
that
put
her
in
so
humiliating
a
light
were
forgotten
as
the
train
swept
her
from
the
heat
and
dust
of
the
city
out
into
the
green
reaches
of
country
to
the
southward
what
had
been
done
upon
the
case
she
had
no
means
of
telling
she
only
knew
that
the
case
was
of
unusual
virulence
and
well
advanced
it
had
killed
one
nurse
already
and
seriously
endangered
the
life
of
another
but
so
far
from
reflecting
on
the
danger
to
herself
lloyd
felt
a
certain
exhilaration
in
the
thought
that
she
was
expected
to
succeed
where
others
had
succumbed
another
battle
with
the
enemy
was
at
hand
the
enemy
who
though
conquered
on
a
hundred
fields
must
inevitably
triumph
in
the
end
once
again
this
enemy
had
stooped
and
caught
a
human
being
in
his
cold
grip
once
again
life
and
death
were
at
grapples
and
death
was
strong
and
from
out
the
struggle
a
cry
had
come
had
come
to
her
a
cry
for
help
all
the
exuberance
of
battle
grew
big
within
her
breast
she
was
impatient
to
be
there
there
at
hand
to
face
the
enemy
again
across
the
where
she
had
so
often
faced
and
outfought
him
before
and
matching
her
force
against
his
force
her
obstinacy
against
his
strength
the
strength
that
would
pull
the
life
from
her
grasp
her
sleepless
vigilance
against
his
stealth
her
intelligence
against
his
cunning
her
courage
against
his
terrors
her
resistance
against
his
attack
her
skill
against
his
strategy
her
science
against
his
worldwide
experience
win
the
fight
save
the
life
hold
firm
against
his
slow
resistless
pull
and
triumph
again
if
it
was
only
for
the
day
succeed
she
would
and
must
her
inborn
obstinacy
her
sturdy
refusal
to
yield
her
ground
whatever
it
should
be
her
stubborn
power
of
resistance
her
tenacity
of
her
chosen
course
came
to
her
aid
as
she
drew
swiftly
near
to
the
spot
whereon
the
battle
would
be
fought
mentally
she
braced
herself
holding
back
with
all
her
fine
native
strength
no
she
would
not
yield
the
life
to
the
enemy
no
she
would
not
give
up
no
she
would
not
recede
let
the
enemy
do
his
worst
she
was
strong
against
his
efforts
at
medford
which
she
reached
toward
four
in
the
afternoon
after
an
hour
ride
from
the
city
she
found
a
conveyance
waiting
for
her
and
was
driven
rapidly
through
streets
bordered
with
villas
and
closely
shaven
lawns
to
a
country
seat
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
the
housekeeper
met
her
at
the
door
with
the
information
that
the
doctor
was
at
the
moment
in
the
and
had
left
orders
that
the
nurse
should
be
brought
to
him
the
moment
she
arrived
the
housekeeper
showed
lloyd
the
way
to
the
second
landing
knocking
upon
the
door
at
the
end
of
the
hall
and
ushering
her
in
without
waiting
for
an
answer
lloyd
took
in
the
room
at
a
glance
the
closely
drawn
curtains
the
screen
between
the
bed
and
the
windows
the
doctor
standing
on
the
and
the
face
of
the
patient
on
the
pillow
then
all
her
power
of
could
not
keep
her
from
uttering
a
smothered
exclamation
for
she
the
woman
who
with
all
the
savage
energy
of
him
bennett
loved
had
at
peril
of
her
life
come
to
nurse
bennett
nearest
friend
the
man
of
all
others
dear
to
him
richard
ferriss
vi
two
days
after
pitts
had
brought
ferriss
to
his
country
house
in
the
outskirts
of
medford
he
had
been
able
to
diagnose
his
sickness
as
typhoid
fever
and
at
once
had
set
about
telegraphing
the
fact
to
bennett
then
it
had
occurred
to
him
that
he
did
not
know
where
bennett
had
gone
bennett
had
omitted
notifying
him
of
his
present
whereabouts
and
acting
upon
pitts
advice
had
hidden
himself
away
from
everybody
neither
at
his
club
nor
at
his
hotel
where
his
mail
accumulated
in
extraordinary
quantities
had
any
forwarding
address
been
left
bennett
would
not
even
know
that
ferriss
had
been
moved
to
medford
so
much
the
worse
it
could
not
be
helped
there
was
nothing
for
the
doctor
to
do
but
to
leave
bennett
in
ignorance
and
go
ahead
and
fight
for
the
life
of
ferriss
as
best
he
could
pitts
arranged
for
a
brother
physician
to
take
over
his
practice
and
devoted
himself
entirely
to
ferriss
and
ferriss
sickened
and
sickened
and
went
steadily
from
bad
to
worse
the
fever
advanced
regularly
to
a
certain
stage
a
stage
of
imminent
danger
and
there
paused
rarely
had
pitts
been
called
upon
to
fight
a
more
virulent
form
of
the
disease
what
made
matters
worse
was
that
ferriss
hung
on
for
so
long
a
time
without
change
one
way
or
another
pitts
had
long
since
been
convinced
of
ulceration
in
the
membrane
of
the
intestines
but
it
astonished
him
that
this
symptom
persisted
so
long
without
signs
either
of
progressing
or
diminishing
the
course
of
the
disease
was
unusually
slow
the
first
nurse
had
already
had
time
to
sicken
and
die
a
second
had
been
infected
and
yet
ferriss
hung
on
neither
sinking
nor
improving
yet
at
every
hour
lying
perilously
near
death
it
was
not
often
that
death
and
life
locked
horns
for
so
long
not
often
that
the
chance
was
so
even
many
was
the
hour
many
was
the
moment
when
a
hair
would
have
turned
the
balance
and
yet
the
balance
was
preserved
at
her
abrupt
recognition
of
ferriss
in
this
patient
whom
she
had
been
summoned
to
nurse
and
whose
hold
upon
life
was
so
pitifully
weak
lloyd
heart
gave
a
great
leap
and
then
sank
ominously
in
her
breast
her
first
emotion
was
one
of
boundless
why
had
she
not
known
of
this
why
had
she
not
questioned
bennett
more
closely
as
to
his
friend
sickness
might
she
not
have
expected
something
like
this
was
not
typhoid
the
one
evil
to
be
feared
and
foreseen
after
experiences
such
as
ferriss
had
undergone
the
fatigue
and
privations
of
the
march
over
the
ice
and
the
subsequent
months
aboard
the
steam
whaler
with
its
bad
food
its
dirt
and
its
inevitable
overcrowding
and
while
she
had
been
idling
in
the
country
this
man
whom
she
had
known
since
her
girlhood
better
and
longer
than
any
of
her
few
acquaintances
had
been
struck
down
and
day
by
day
had
weakened
and
sickened
and
wasted
until
now
at
any
hour
at
any
moment
the
life
might
be
snuffed
out
like
the
fight
of
a
spent
candle
what
a
miserable
incompetent
had
she
been
that
day
in
the
park
when
she
had
come
upon
him
so
weak
and
broken
and
far
spent
why
had
she
not
with
all
her
training
and
experience
known
that
even
then
the
flame
was
flickering
down
to
the
socket
that
a
link
in
the
silver
chain
was
weakening
now
perhaps
it
was
too
late
but
quick
her
original
obstinacy
rose
up
in
protest
no
she
would
not
yield
the
life
no
no
no
again
and
a
thousand
times
no
he
belonged
to
her
others
she
had
saved
others
far
less
dear
to
her
than
ferriss
her
last
patient
the
little
girl
she
had
caught
back
from
death
at
the
eleventh
hour
and
of
all
men
would
she
not
save
ferriss
in
such
sickness
as
this
it
was
the
nurse
and
not
the
doctor
who
must
be
depended
upon
and
once
again
never
so
strong
never
so
fine
never
so
glorious
her
splendid
independence
her
pride
in
her
own
strength
her
indomitable
leaped
in
her
breast
leaped
and
stood
firm
hard
as
tempered
steel
head
to
the
enemy
daring
the
assault
defiant
immovable
unshaken
in
its
resolve
unconquerable
in
the
steadfast
tenacity
of
its
purpose
the
story
that
ferriss
had
told
to
bennett
that
and
inexplicable
falsehood
was
a
thing
forgotten
death
stood
at
the
and
in
that
room
the
little
things
of
life
had
no
place
the
king
was
holding
court
and
the
swarm
of
small
everyday
issues
like
a
crowd
of
petty
courtiers
were
not
admitted
to
his
presence
life
was
in
danger
lloyd
saw
no
more
than
that
at
once
she
set
about
the
work
in
a
few
rapid
sentences
exchanged
in
low
voices
between
her
and
the
doctor
lloyd
made
herself
acquainted
with
the
case
we
been
using
the
and
to
bring
down
the
temperature
in
place
of
the
cold
bath
the
doctor
explained
afraid
of
pericarditis
quinine
inquired
lloyd
from
twenty
to
forty
grains
in
the
morning
and
evening
here
the
temperature
chart
for
the
last
week
if
we
reach
this
point
in
axilla
again
he
indicated
one
hundred
and
two
degrees
with
a
we
have
to
risk
the
cold
bath
but
only
in
that
case
and
the
tympanites
pitts
put
his
chin
in
the
air
grave
there
an
intestinal
ulcer
no
doubt
of
it
and
if
it
perforates
well
we
can
send
for
the
undertaker
then
has
he
had
hemorrhages
two
in
the
first
week
but
not
profuse
he
seemed
to
rally
fairly
well
afterward
we
have
been
injecting
ether
in
case
of
anemia
really
miss
searight
the
case
is
interesting
but
wicked
wicked
as
original
sin
killed
off
my
first
nurse
out
of
hand
good
little
boy
conscientious
enough
took
no
care
of
himself
ate
his
meals
in
the
against
my
wishes
off
he
went
dicrotic
pulse
diarrhea
vomiting
hospital
thrombosis
of
pulmonary
artery
requiescat
and
miss
wakeley
knocked
under
yesterday
and
she
was
fairly
saturated
with
creolin
night
and
morning
i
do
know
how
it
happened
well
god
for
us
all
here
he
is
that
the
point
for
us
he
glanced
toward
the
bed
and
for
the
third
time
lloyd
looked
at
the
patient
ferriss
was
in
a
quiet
delirium
and
at
intervals
from
behind
his
lips
dry
and
brown
and
fissured
there
came
the
sounds
of
low
and
indistinct
muttering
barring
a
certain
prominence
of
the
his
face
was
not
very
wasted
but
its
skin
was
a
strange
dusky
pallor
the
cold
pack
was
about
his
head
like
a
sort
of
caricatured
crown
well
repeated
pitts
in
a
moment
i
been
waiting
for
you
to
come
to
get
a
little
rest
was
up
all
last
night
suppose
you
take
over
charge
lloyd
nodded
her
head
removing
her
hat
and
gloves
making
herself
ready
pitts
gave
her
some
final
directions
and
left
her
alone
in
the
for
the
moment
there
was
nothing
to
do
for
the
patient
lloyd
put
on
her
hospital
slippers
and
moved
silently
about
the
room
preparing
for
the
night
and
making
some
few
changes
in
the
matter
of
light
and
ventilation
then
for
a
while
the
medicine
occupied
her
attention
and
she
was
at
some
pains
to
carefully
sort
out
the
antiseptic
and
disinfectants
from
the
drugs
themselves
these
latter
she
arranged
on
a
table
by
themselves
studying
the
labels
assuring
herself
of
their
uses
quinine
for
the
regular
morning
and
evening
doses
sulphonal
and
trional
for
insomnia
ether
for
injections
in
case
of
anemia
after
hemorrhage
morphine
for
delirium
citrite
of
caffeine
for
weakness
of
the
heart
tincture
of
valerian
for
the
tympanites
bismuth
to
relieve
nausea
and
vomiting
and
the
crushed
ice
wrapped
in
flannel
cloths
for
the
cold
pack
in
the
event
of
hyperpyrexia
later
in
the
evening
she
took
the
temperature
in
the
armpit
noted
the
condition
of
the
pulse
and
managed
to
get
ferriss
still
in
his
quiet
muttering
delirium
to
drink
a
glass
of
peptonised
milk
she
administered
the
quinine
reading
the
label
as
was
her
custom
three
times
once
as
she
took
it
up
again
as
she
measured
the
dose
and
a
last
time
as
she
returned
the
bottle
to
its
place
everything
she
did
every
minute
change
in
ferriss
condition
she
entered
upon
a
chart
so
that
in
the
morning
when
pitts
should
relieve
her
he
could
grasp
the
situation
at
a
glance
the
night
passed
without
any
but
the
expected
variations
of
the
pulse
and
temperature
though
toward
daylight
lloyd
could
fancy
that
ferriss
for
a
few
moments
came
out
of
his
delirium
and
was
conscious
of
his
surroundings
for
a
few
seconds
his
eyes
seemed
to
regain
something
of
their
intelligence
and
his
glance
moved
curiously
about
the
room
but
lloyd
sitting
near
the
of
the
bed
turned
her
head
from
him
it
was
not
expedient
that
ferriss
should
recognise
her
now
lloyd
could
not
but
commend
the
wisdom
of
bringing
ferriss
to
pitts
own
house
in
so
quiet
a
place
as
medford
the
doctor
risked
nothing
he
was
without
a
family
the
only
other
occupants
of
the
house
being
the
housekeeper
and
cook
on
more
than
one
occasion
when
an
interesting
case
needed
constant
watching
pitts
had
used
his
house
as
a
sanatorium
quiet
as
the
little
village
itself
was
the
house
was
removed
some
little
distance
from
its
outskirts
the
air
was
fine
and
pure
the
stillness
the
calm
the
unbroken
repose
was
almost
in
the
early
watches
of
the
night
just
at
the
turn
of
the
dawn
lloyd
heard
the
faint
rumble
of
a
passing
train
at
the
station
nearly
five
miles
away
for
hours
that
and
the
prolonged
stridulating
of
the
crickets
were
the
only
sounds
then
at
last
while
it
was
yet
dark
a
faint
chittering
of
waking
birds
began
from
under
the
eaves
and
from
the
in
the
yard
about
the
house
lloyd
went
to
the
window
and
drawing
aside
the
curtains
stood
there
for
a
moment
looking
out
she
could
see
part
of
the
road
leading
to
the
town
and
in
the
distance
the
edge
of
the
town
itself
a
few
country
residences
of
suburban
dwellers
of
the
city
and
farther
on
a
large
rectangular
brick
building
with
cupola
and
flagstaff
perhaps
the
public
school
or
the
bank
or
the
odd
fellows
hall
nearer
by
were
fields
and
corners
of
pasture
land
with
here
and
there
the
formless
shapes
of
drowsing
cows
one
of
these
as
lloyd
watched
changed
position
and
she
could
almost
hear
the
long
deep
breath
that
accompanied
the
motion
far
off
miles
upon
miles
so
it
seemed
a
rooster
was
crowing
at
exact
intervals
all
at
once
and
close
at
hand
another
answered
a
gay
brisk
carillon
that
woke
the
echoes
in
an
instant
for
the
first
time
lloyd
noticed
a
pale
dim
belt
of
light
low
in
the
east
toward
eight
in
the
morning
the
doctor
came
to
relieve
her
and
while
he
was
examining
the
charts
and
she
was
making
her
report
for
the
night
the
housekeeper
announced
breakfast
go
down
to
your
breakfast
miss
searight
said
the
doctor
i
stay
here
the
while
the
housekeeper
will
show
you
to
your
room
but
before
breakfasting
lloyd
went
to
the
room
the
housekeeper
had
set
apart
for
her
a
different
one
than
had
been
occupied
by
either
of
the
previous
nurses
changed
her
dress
and
bathed
her
face
and
hands
in
a
disinfecting
solution
when
she
came
out
of
her
room
the
doctor
met
her
in
the
hall
his
hat
and
stick
were
in
his
hand
he
has
gone
to
sleep
he
informed
her
and
is
resting
quietly
i
am
going
to
get
a
mouthful
of
fresh
air
along
the
road
the
housekeeper
is
with
him
if
he
wakes
she
call
you
i
will
not
be
gone
fifteen
minutes
i
not
been
out
of
the
house
for
five
days
and
there
no
danger
breakfast
had
been
laid
in
what
the
doctor
spoke
of
as
the
this
was
an
enclosed
veranda
one
side
being
of
glass
and
opening
by
french
windows
directly
upon
a
little
lawn
that
sloped
away
under
the
to
the
road
it
was
a
charming
apartment
an
idea
of
a
sister
of
pitts
who
at
one
time
had
spent
two
years
at
medford
lloyd
breakfasted
here
alone
and
it
was
here
that
bennett
found
her
the
one
public
carriage
of
medford
a
sort
of
carryall
that
met
all
the
trains
at
the
depot
had
driven
to
the
gate
at
the
foot
of
the
yard
and
had
pulled
up
the
horses
reeking
and
blowing
even
before
it
had
stopped
a
tall
man
had
alighted
but
it
was
not
until
he
was
up
the
gravel
walk
that
lloyd
had
recognised
him
bennett
caught
sight
of
her
at
the
same
moment
and
strode
swiftly
across
the
lawn
and
came
into
the
by
one
of
the
open
french
windows
at
once
the
room
seemed
to
shrink
in
size
his
first
step
upon
the
floor
a
step
that
was
almost
a
stamp
so
eager
it
was
so
masterful
and
resolute
set
the
panes
of
glass
jarring
in
their
frames
never
had
bennett
seemed
more
out
of
place
than
in
this
almost
dainty
with
its
small
feminine
appurtenances
its
fragile
glassware
its
pots
of
flowers
and
growing
plants
the
incongruous
surroundings
emphasized
his
every
roughness
his
every
angularity
against
its
background
of
delicate
mild
tints
his
figure
loomed
suddenly
colossal
the
great
span
of
his
chest
and
shoulders
seemed
never
so
huge
his
face
the
great
brutal
jaw
with
its
aggressive
bullying
forward
thrust
the
lips
the
contracted
forehead
the
small
eyes
marred
with
the
sharply
defined
cast
appeared
never
so
harsh
never
so
massive
never
so
significant
of
the
resistless
crude
force
of
the
man
his
energy
his
overpowering
determination
as
he
towered
there
before
her
one
hand
gripped
upon
a
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
hand
had
but
to
close
to
crush
the
little
varnished
woodwork
to
a
splinter
and
when
he
spoke
lloyd
could
imagine
that
the
fine
frail
china
of
the
table
vibrated
to
the
bass
of
his
voice
lloyd
had
only
to
look
at
him
once
to
know
that
bennett
was
at
the
moment
aroused
and
agitated
to
an
extraordinary
degree
his
face
was
congested
and
flaming
under
his
frown
his
eyes
seemed
flashing
veritable
sparks
his
teeth
were
set
in
his
temple
a
vein
stood
prominent
and
throbbing
but
lloyd
was
not
surprised
bennett
had
no
doubt
heard
of
ferriss
desperate
illness
small
wonder
he
was
excited
when
the
life
of
his
dearest
friend
was
threatened
lloyd
could
ignore
her
own
quarrel
with
bennett
at
such
a
moment
i
am
so
sorry
she
began
that
you
could
not
have
known
sooner
but
you
remember
you
left
no
address
there
was
what
are
you
doing
here
he
broke
in
abruptly
what
is
the
use
why
he
paused
for
a
moment
to
steady
his
voice
you
ca
stay
here
he
went
on
do
you
know
the
risk
you
are
running
you
stay
here
another
moment
that
answered
lloyd
smiling
is
a
matter
that
is
interesting
chiefly
to
me
i
suppose
you
know
that
mr
bennett
i
know
that
you
are
risking
your
life
and
and
that
too
is
my
affair
i
have
made
it
mine
he
responded
quickly
oh
he
exclaimed
sharply
striking
the
back
of
the
chair
with
his
open
palm
why
must
we
always
be
at
with
each
other
i
not
good
at
talking
what
is
the
use
of
tangling
ourselves
with
phrases
i
love
you
and
i
come
out
here
to
ask
you
to
beg
you
you
understand
to
leave
this
house
where
you
are
foolishly
risking
your
life
you
must
do
it
he
went
on
rapidly
i
love
you
too
well
your
life
is
too
much
to
me
to
allow
you
to
hazard
it
senselessly
foolishly
there
are
other
women
other
nurses
who
can
take
your
place
but
you
are
not
going
to
stay
here
lloyd
felt
her
indignation
rising
this
is
my
profession
she
answered
trying
to
keep
back
her
anger
i
am
here
because
it
is
my
duty
to
be
here
then
suddenly
as
his
extraordinary
effrontery
dawned
upon
her
she
exclaimed
rising
to
her
feet
do
i
need
to
explain
to
you
what
i
do
i
am
here
because
i
choose
to
be
here
that
is
enough
i
do
care
to
go
any
further
with
such
a
discussion
as
this
you
will
not
leave
here
then
no
bennett
hesitated
an
instant
searching
for
his
words
then
i
do
not
know
how
to
ask
favours
i
had
little
experience
in
that
sort
of
thing
you
must
know
how
hard
it
is
for
me
and
you
must
understand
to
what
lengths
i
am
driven
then
when
i
entreat
you
when
i
beg
of
you
as
humbly
as
it
is
possible
for
me
to
do
so
to
leave
this
house
now
at
once
there
is
a
train
to
the
city
within
the
hour
some
one
else
can
take
your
place
before
noon
we
can
telegraph
will
you
go
you
are
absurd
lloyd
ca
you
see
do
you
understand
it
as
though
i
saw
you
rushing
toward
a
precipice
with
your
eyes
shut
my
place
is
here
i
shall
not
leave
but
bennett
next
move
surprised
her
his
eagerness
his
agitation
left
him
upon
the
instant
he
took
out
his
watch
i
was
wrong
he
said
quietly
the
next
train
will
not
go
for
an
hour
and
a
quarter
there
is
more
time
than
i
supposed
then
with
as
much
gentleness
as
he
could
command
he
added
lloyd
you
are
going
to
take
that
train
now
you
are
becoming
a
little
more
than
absurd
she
answered
i
do
know
bennett
whether
or
not
you
intend
to
be
offensive
but
i
think
you
are
succeeding
rather
well
you
came
to
this
house
uninvited
you
invade
a
gentleman
private
residence
and
you
attempt
to
meddle
and
to
interfere
with
me
in
the
practice
of
my
profession
if
you
think
you
can
impress
me
with
heroics
and
declamation
please
correct
yourself
at
once
you
have
only
succeeded
in
making
yourself
a
little
vulgar
that
may
be
true
or
not
he
answered
with
an
indifferent
movement
of
his
shoulders
it
is
all
one
to
me
i
have
made
up
my
mind
that
you
shall
leave
this
house
this
morning
and
believe
me
miss
searight
i
shall
carry
my
point
for
the
moment
lloyd
caught
her
breath
for
the
moment
she
saw
clearly
with
just
what
sort
of
man
she
had
to
deal
there
was
a
conviction
in
his
manner
now
that
he
had
quieted
himself
that
suddenly
appeared
unanswerable
it
was
like
the
slow
still
moving
of
a
piston
but
the
next
moment
her
own
character
reasserted
itself
she
remembered
what
she
was
herself
if
he
was
determined
she
was
obstinate
if
he
was
resolved
she
was
stubborn
if
he
was
powerful
she
was
unyielding
never
had
she
conceded
her
point
before
never
had
she
allowed
herself
to
be
thwarted
in
the
pursuance
of
a
course
she
believed
to
be
right
was
she
of
all
women
to
yield
now
the
consciousness
of
her
own
power
of
resistance
came
suddenly
to
her
aid
bennett
was
strong
but
was
she
not
strong
herself
where
under
the
blue
sky
was
the
power
that
could
break
down
her
will
when
death
itself
could
not
prevail
against
her
what
in
life
could
shake
her
resolution
suddenly
the
tremendous
import
of
the
moment
the
magnitude
of
the
situation
flashed
upon
lloyd
both
of
them
had
staked
everything
upon
this
issue
two
characters
of
extraordinary
power
clashed
violently
together
there
was
to
be
no
compromise
no
either
she
or
bennett
must
in
the
end
be
beaten
one
of
them
was
to
be
broken
and
humbled
beyond
all
retrieving
there
in
that
commonplace
little
room
with
its
trivial
accessories
its
inadequate
background
a
battle
royal
swiftly
prepared
itself
with
the
abruptness
of
an
explosion
the
crisis
developed
do
i
need
to
tell
you
remarked
bennett
that
your
life
is
rather
more
to
me
than
any
other
consideration
in
the
world
do
you
suppose
when
the
lives
of
every
member
of
my
command
depended
upon
me
i
was
any
less
resolved
to
succeed
than
i
am
now
i
succeeded
then
and
i
shall
succeed
now
now
when
there
is
much
more
at
stake
i
am
not
accustomed
to
failure
and
i
shall
not
fail
now
i
assure
you
that
i
shall
stop
at
nothing
it
was
beyond
lloyd
to
retain
her
calmness
under
such
aggression
it
seemed
as
though
her
demanded
that
she
should
lose
her
temper
and
you
think
you
can
drive
me
as
you
drove
your
she
exclaimed
what
have
you
to
do
with
me
am
i
your
subordinate
do
you
think
you
can
bully
me
we
are
not
in
kolyuchin
bay
mr
bennett
you
the
woman
i
love
he
answered
with
an
abrupt
return
of
vehemence
and
by
god
i
shall
stop
at
nothing
to
save
your
life
and
my
love
for
you
that
you
pretend
is
so
much
to
you
i
suppose
that
this
is
the
means
you
take
to
awaken
it
admitting
for
the
moment
that
you
could
induce
me
to
shirk
my
duty
how
should
i
love
you
for
it
ask
yourself
that
but
bennett
had
but
one
answer
to
all
her
words
he
struck
his
fist
into
the
palm
of
his
hand
as
he
answered
your
life
is
more
to
me
than
any
other
consideration
but
my
life
how
do
you
know
it
is
a
question
of
my
life
come
if
we
are
to
quarrel
let
us
quarrel
upon
reasonable
grounds
it
does
not
follow
that
i
risk
my
life
by
staying
leave
the
house
first
we
can
talk
of
that
afterward
i
have
allowed
you
to
talk
too
much
already
she
exclaimed
angrily
let
us
come
to
the
bottom
of
things
at
once
i
will
not
be
influenced
nor
cajoled
nor
bullied
into
leaving
my
post
now
do
you
understand
that
is
my
final
answer
you
who
were
a
commander
who
were
a
leader
of
men
what
would
you
have
done
if
one
of
your
party
had
left
his
post
at
a
time
of
danger
i
can
tell
you
what
you
would
have
done
you
would
have
shot
him
after
first
disgracing
him
and
now
you
would
disgrace
me
is
it
reasonable
is
it
consistent
bennett
snapped
his
fingers
that
for
consistency
and
you
would
be
willing
to
disgrace
me
to
have
me
disgrace
myself
your
life
began
bennett
again
but
suddenly
lloyd
flashed
out
upon
him
with
my
life
my
life
are
there
not
some
things
better
than
life
you
above
all
men
should
understand
that
much
oh
be
yourself
be
the
man
i
thought
you
were
you
have
your
code
let
me
have
mine
you
could
not
be
what
you
are
you
could
not
have
done
what
you
did
if
you
had
not
set
so
many
things
above
merely
your
life
admit
that
you
could
not
have
loved
me
unless
you
believed
that
i
could
do
the
same
how
could
you
still
love
me
if
you
knew
i
had
failed
in
my
duty
how
could
you
still
love
me
if
you
knew
that
you
had
broken
down
my
will
i
know
you
better
than
you
know
yourself
you
loved
me
because
you
knew
me
to
be
strong
and
brave
and
to
be
above
petty
deceptions
and
shams
and
subterfuges
and
now
you
ask
me
to
fail
to
give
up
to
shirk
and
you
tell
me
you
do
so
because
you
love
me
that
is
all
so
many
words
to
me
i
can
not
argue
with
you
and
there
is
no
time
for
it
i
did
not
come
here
to
converse
never
in
her
life
before
had
lloyd
been
so
angry
as
at
that
moment
the
sombre
crimson
of
her
cheeks
had
suddenly
given
place
to
an
unwonted
paleness
even
her
eyes
that
so
rarely
sparkled
were
all
alight
she
straightened
herself
very
well
then
she
answered
quietly
our
conversation
can
stop
where
it
is
you
will
excuse
me
bennett
if
i
leave
you
i
have
my
work
to
do
bennett
was
standing
between
her
and
the
door
he
did
not
move
very
gravely
he
said
do
please
do
bring
it
to
that
lloyd
flashed
a
look
at
him
her
eyes
wide
exclaiming
you
do
mean
you
do
dare
i
tell
you
again
that
i
mean
to
carry
my
point
and
i
tell
you
that
i
shall
leave
my
patient
bennett
met
her
glance
for
an
instant
and
holding
her
gaze
with
his
answered
but
two
words
speaking
in
a
low
voice
and
with
measured
slowness
he
said
you
shall
there
was
a
silence
the
two
stood
there
looking
straight
into
one
another
eyes
their
mutual
opposition
at
its
climax
the
seconds
began
to
pass
the
conflict
between
the
man
aggression
and
the
resistance
reached
its
turning
point
before
another
word
should
be
spoken
before
the
minute
should
pass
one
of
the
two
must
give
ground
and
then
it
was
that
lloyd
felt
something
breakdown
within
her
something
to
which
she
could
not
put
a
name
a
mysterious
element
of
her
character
hitherto
rigid
and
intact
was
beginning
at
last
to
crumble
somewhere
a
breach
had
been
opened
somewhere
the
barrier
had
been
undermined
the
fine
steadfastness
that
was
hers
and
that
she
had
so
dearly
prized
her
strength
in
which
she
had
gloried
her
independence
her
splendid
arrogant
and
conscious
power
seemed
all
at
once
to
weaken
before
this
iron
resolve
that
shut
its
ears
and
eyes
this
colossal
untutored
savage
intensity
of
purpose
and
abruptly
her
eyes
were
opened
and
the
inherent
weakness
of
her
sex
became
apparent
to
her
was
it
a
mistake
then
could
not
a
woman
be
strong
was
her
strength
grafted
upon
elemental
weakness
not
her
individual
weakness
but
the
weakness
of
her
sex
the
intended
natural
weakness
of
the
woman
had
she
built
her
fancied
impregnable
fortress
upon
sand
but
habit
was
too
strong
for
an
instant
brief
as
the
opening
and
shutting
of
an
eye
a
vision
was
vouchsafed
to
her
one
of
those
swift
glimpses
into
unplumbed
depths
that
come
sometimes
to
the
human
mind
in
the
moments
of
its
exaltation
but
that
are
gone
with
such
rapidity
that
they
may
not
be
trusted
for
an
instant
lloyd
saw
deep
down
into
the
black
mysterious
gulf
of
sex
down
down
down
where
immeasurably
below
the
world
of
little
things
the
changeless
dreadful
machinery
of
life
itself
worked
clashing
and
resistless
in
its
grooves
it
was
a
glimpse
fortunately
brief
a
vision
that
does
not
come
too
often
lest
reason
brought
to
the
edge
of
the
abyss
grow
giddy
at
the
sight
and
reeling
topple
headlong
but
quick
the
vision
passed
the
gulf
closed
and
she
felt
the
firm
ground
again
beneath
her
feet
i
shall
not
she
cried
was
it
the
same
woman
who
had
spoken
but
one
moment
before
did
her
voice
ring
with
the
same
undaunted
defiance
was
there
not
a
note
of
despair
in
her
tones
a
barely
perceptible
quaver
the
symbol
of
her
wavering
resolve
was
not
the
very
fact
that
she
must
question
her
strength
proof
positive
that
her
strength
was
waning
but
her
courage
was
unshaken
even
if
her
strength
was
breaking
to
the
last
she
would
strive
to
the
end
she
would
hold
her
forehead
high
not
till
the
last
hope
had
been
tried
would
she
acknowledge
her
defeat
but
in
any
case
she
said
risk
is
better
than
certainty
if
i
risk
my
life
by
staying
it
is
certain
that
he
will
die
if
i
leave
him
at
this
critical
moment
so
much
the
worse
then
you
can
not
stay
lloyd
stared
at
him
in
amazement
it
is
possible
i
do
believe
you
can
understand
do
you
know
how
sick
he
is
do
you
know
that
he
is
lying
at
the
point
of
death
at
this
very
moment
and
that
the
longer
i
stay
away
from
him
the
more
his
life
is
in
peril
has
he
not
rights
as
well
as
i
has
he
not
a
right
to
live
it
is
not
only
my
own
humiliation
that
is
at
stake
it
is
the
life
of
your
dearest
friend
the
man
who
stood
by
you
and
helped
you
and
who
suffered
the
same
hardships
and
privations
as
yourself
what
that
demanded
bennett
with
a
sudden
frown
if
i
leave
ferriss
now
if
he
is
left
alone
here
for
so
much
as
half
an
hour
i
will
not
answer
ferriss
what
are
you
talking
about
what
is
your
patient
name
did
you
know
ferriss
dick
ferriss
do
tell
me
it
dick
ferriss
i
thought
all
the
time
you
knew
that
you
had
heard
yes
it
is
mr
ferriss
is
he
very
sick
what
is
he
doing
out
here
no
i
had
not
heard
nobody
told
me
pitts
was
to
write
to
to
wire
will
he
pull
through
the
matter
with
him
is
it
he
who
had
typhoid
he
is
very
dangerously
pitts
brought
him
here
this
is
his
house
we
do
not
know
if
he
will
get
well
it
is
only
by
watching
him
every
instant
that
we
can
hope
for
anything
at
this
moment
there
is
no
one
with
him
but
a
servant
bennett
am
i
to
go
to
my
patient
but
but
we
can
get
some
one
else
not
before
three
hours
and
it
only
the
truth
when
i
tell
you
he
may
die
at
any
minute
am
i
to
go
in
a
second
of
time
the
hideous
situation
leaped
up
before
eyes
right
or
wrong
the
conviction
that
lloyd
was
terribly
imperilling
her
life
by
remaining
at
her
patient
bedside
had
sunk
into
his
mind
and
was
not
to
be
eradicated
it
was
a
terror
that
had
gripped
him
close
and
that
could
not
be
reasoned
away
but
ferriss
what
of
him
now
it
had
brusquely
transpired
that
his
life
too
hung
in
the
balance
how
to
decide
how
to
meet
this
abominable
complication
wherein
he
must
sacrifice
the
woman
he
so
dearly
loved
or
the
man
who
was
the
damon
to
his
pythias
the
jonathan
to
his
david
am
i
to
go
repeated
lloyd
for
the
third
time
bennett
closed
his
eyes
clasping
his
head
with
both
hands
great
god
wait
wait
i
ca
think
i
i
oh
this
is
terrible
lloyd
drove
home
her
advantage
mercilessly
wait
i
tell
you
we
ca
wait
then
bennett
realised
with
a
great
spasm
of
horror
that
for
him
there
was
no
going
back
all
his
life
accustomed
to
quick
decisions
in
moments
of
supreme
peril
he
took
his
decision
now
facing
with
such
courage
as
he
could
muster
its
unspeakable
consequences
consequences
that
he
knew
must
harry
and
hound
him
all
the
rest
of
his
life
whichever
way
he
decided
he
opened
his
heart
to
the
beak
and
talons
of
a
pitiless
remorse
he
could
no
longer
see
in
the
dreadful
confusion
of
his
mind
the
right
of
things
or
the
wrong
of
things
could
not
accurately
weigh
chances
or
possibilities
for
him
only
two
alternatives
presented
themselves
the
death
of
ferriss
or
the
death
of
lloyd
he
could
see
no
compromise
could
imagine
no
escape
it
was
as
though
a
headsman
with
ready
axe
stood
at
his
elbow
awaiting
his
commands
and
besides
all
this
he
had
long
since
passed
the
limit
though
perhaps
he
did
not
know
it
himself
where
he
could
see
anything
but
the
point
he
had
determined
to
gain
the
goal
he
had
determined
to
reach
his
mind
was
made
up
his
furious
energy
his
resolve
to
conquer
at
all
costs
had
become
at
last
a
sort
of
directed
frenzy
the
engine
he
had
set
in
motion
was
now
beyond
his
control
he
could
not
now
whether
he
would
or
no
reverse
its
action
swerve
it
from
its
iron
path
call
it
back
from
the
monstrous
catastrophe
toward
which
it
was
speeding
him
god
help
us
all
he
muttered
well
said
lloyd
expectantly
bennett
drew
a
deep
breath
his
hands
falling
helplessly
at
his
sides
in
a
way
he
appeared
suddenly
bowed
the
great
frame
of
bone
and
sinew
seemed
in
some
strange
indefinable
manner
to
shrink
to
stagger
under
the
sudden
assumption
of
an
intolerable
burden
a
burden
that
was
never
to
be
lifted
even
then
however
bennett
still
believed
in
the
wisdom
of
his
course
still
believed
himself
to
be
right
but
right
or
wrong
he
now
must
go
forward
was
it
fate
was
it
doom
was
it
destiny
bennett
entire
life
had
been
spent
in
the
working
out
of
great
ideas
in
the
face
of
great
obstacles
continually
he
had
been
called
upon
to
overcome
enormous
difficulties
with
enormous
strength
for
long
periods
of
time
he
had
been
isolated
from
civilisation
had
been
face
to
face
with
the
simple
crude
forces
of
an
elemental
world
forces
that
were
to
be
combated
and
overthrown
by
means
no
less
simple
and
crude
than
themselves
he
had
lost
the
faculty
possessed
no
doubt
by
smaller
minds
of
dealing
with
complicated
situations
to
resort
to
expedients
to
make
concessions
was
all
beyond
him
for
him
a
thing
was
absolutely
right
or
absolutely
wrong
and
between
the
two
there
was
no
gradation
for
so
long
a
time
had
he
looked
at
the
larger
broader
situations
of
life
that
his
mental
vision
had
become
all
deformed
and
confused
he
saw
things
invariably
magnified
beyond
all
proportion
or
else
dwarfed
to
a
littleness
that
was
beneath
consideration
normal
vision
was
denied
him
it
was
as
though
he
studied
the
world
through
one
or
the
other
ends
of
a
telescope
and
when
as
at
present
his
emotions
were
aroused
matters
were
only
made
the
worse
the
idea
that
ferriss
might
recover
though
lloyd
should
leave
him
at
this
moment
hardly
presented
itself
to
his
mind
he
was
convinced
that
if
lloyd
went
away
ferriss
would
die
lloyd
had
said
as
much
herself
the
hope
that
lloyd
might
after
all
nurse
him
through
his
sickness
without
danger
to
herself
was
so
remote
that
he
did
not
consider
it
for
one
instant
if
lloyd
remained
she
like
the
other
nurse
would
contract
the
disease
and
die
these
were
the
measures
bennett
did
not
understand
the
expedients
he
could
no
longer
see
it
was
either
lloyd
or
ferriss
he
must
choose
between
them
bennett
went
to
the
door
of
the
room
closed
it
and
leaned
against
it
no
he
said
lloyd
was
stricken
speechless
for
the
instant
she
shrank
before
him
as
if
from
a
murderer
bennett
now
knew
precisely
the
terrible
danger
in
which
he
left
the
man
who
was
his
dearest
friend
would
he
actually
consent
to
his
death
it
was
almost
beyond
belief
and
for
the
moment
lloyd
herself
quailed
before
him
her
first
thoughts
were
not
of
herself
but
of
ferriss
if
he
was
bennett
friend
he
was
her
friend
too
at
that
very
moment
he
might
be
dying
for
want
of
her
care
she
was
fast
becoming
desperate
for
the
moment
she
could
put
all
thought
of
herself
and
of
her
own
dignity
in
the
background
what
is
it
you
want
she
cried
is
it
my
humiliation
you
ask
well
then
you
have
it
it
is
as
hard
for
me
to
ask
favours
as
it
is
for
you
i
am
as
proud
as
you
but
i
entreat
you
you
hear
me
as
humbly
as
i
can
to
let
me
go
what
do
you
want
more
than
that
oh
ca
you
understand
while
we
talk
here
while
you
keep
me
here
he
may
be
dying
is
it
a
time
for
arguments
is
it
a
time
for
misunderstandings
is
it
a
time
to
think
of
ourselves
of
our
own
lives
our
own
little
affairs
she
clasped
her
hands
will
you
please
can
i
can
i
say
more
than
that
will
you
please
let
me
go
no
with
a
great
effort
lloyd
tried
to
regain
her
she
paused
a
moment
then
listen
she
said
you
say
that
you
love
me
that
i
am
more
to
you
than
even
ferriss
your
truest
friend
i
do
not
wish
to
think
of
myself
at
such
a
time
as
this
but
supposing
that
you
should
make
me
that
i
should
consent
to
leave
my
patient
think
of
me
then
afterward
can
i
go
back
there
to
the
house
the
house
that
i
built
can
i
face
the
women
of
my
profession
what
would
they
think
of
me
what
would
my
friends
think
of
me
i
who
have
held
my
head
so
high
you
will
ruin
my
life
i
should
have
to
give
up
my
profession
oh
ca
you
see
in
what
position
you
would
place
me
suddenly
the
tears
sprang
to
her
eyes
no
she
cried
vehemently
no
no
no
i
will
not
i
will
not
be
disgraced
i
have
no
wish
to
disgrace
you
answered
bennett
it
is
strange
for
you
to
say
that
to
me
if
i
love
you
so
well
that
i
can
give
up
ferriss
for
then
if
you
love
me
so
much
as
that
there
must
be
one
thing
that
you
would
set
even
above
my
life
do
you
wish
to
make
me
hate
you
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
more
to
me
than
your
life
you
know
that
how
can
you
think
it
of
me
because
you
do
understand
because
you
do
know
that
oh
that
i
love
you
i
no
i
did
mean
i
did
mean
what
had
she
said
what
had
happened
how
was
it
that
the
words
that
yesterday
she
would
have
been
ashamed
to
so
much
as
whisper
to
herself
had
now
rushed
to
her
lips
almost
of
their
own
accord
after
all
those
years
of
repression
suddenly
the
sweet
dim
thought
she
had
hidden
in
her
secretest
heart
heart
had
leaped
to
light
and
to
articulate
words
unasked
unbidden
she
had
told
him
that
she
loved
him
she
she
had
done
this
thing
when
but
a
few
moments
before
her
anger
against
him
had
shaken
her
to
her
very
the
hot
intolerable
shame
of
it
smote
like
fire
into
her
face
her
world
was
cracking
about
her
ears
everything
she
had
prized
the
dearest
was
being
torn
from
her
everything
she
had
fancied
the
strongest
was
being
overthrown
had
she
she
who
had
held
herself
so
proud
and
high
come
at
last
to
this
swiftly
she
turned
from
him
and
clasped
her
hands
before
her
eyes
and
sank
down
into
the
chair
she
had
quitted
bowing
her
head
upon
her
arms
hiding
her
face
shutting
herself
from
the
light
of
day
quivering
and
thrilling
with
an
agony
of
shame
and
with
an
utter
an
abject
that
was
beyond
all
power
of
expression
but
the
instant
she
felt
bennett
touch
upon
her
shoulder
she
sprang
up
as
if
a
knife
had
pierced
her
and
shrank
from
him
turning
her
head
away
her
hand
palm
outward
before
her
eyes
oh
please
she
begged
piteously
almost
inarticulately
in
the
stress
of
her
emotion
do
if
you
are
a
man
do
take
advantage
please
please
do
touch
me
let
me
go
away
she
was
talking
to
deaf
ears
in
two
steps
bennett
had
reached
her
side
and
had
taken
her
in
his
arms
lloyd
could
not
resist
her
vigour
of
body
as
well
as
of
mind
was
crushed
and
broken
and
beaten
down
and
why
was
it
that
in
spite
of
her
shame
that
in
spite
of
her
unutterable
the
very
touch
of
her
cheek
upon
his
shoulder
was
a
comfort
why
was
it
that
to
feel
herself
carried
away
in
the
rush
of
this
harsh
impetuous
masculine
power
was
a
happiness
why
was
it
that
to
know
that
her
prided
fortitude
and
hitherto
unshaken
power
were
being
overwhelmed
and
broken
with
a
brutal
ruthless
strength
was
an
exultation
and
a
glory
why
was
it
that
she
who
but
a
moment
before
quailed
from
his
lightest
touch
now
put
her
arms
about
his
neck
and
clung
to
him
with
a
sense
of
protection
and
of
refuge
the
need
of
which
she
had
always
and
until
that
very
moment
disdained
why
should
you
be
sorry
because
you
spoke
said
bennett
i
knew
that
you
loved
me
and
you
knew
that
i
loved
you
what
does
it
matter
if
you
said
it
or
did
not
say
it
we
know
each
other
you
and
i
we
understand
you
knew
that
i
loved
you
you
think
that
i
have
been
strong
and
determined
and
have
done
the
things
i
set
out
to
do
what
i
am
is
what
you
made
me
what
i
have
done
i
have
done
because
i
thought
you
would
approve
do
you
think
i
would
have
come
back
if
i
had
not
known
that
i
was
coming
back
to
you
suddenly
an
impatient
exclamation
escaped
him
and
his
clasp
about
her
tightened
oh
words
the
mere
things
that
one
can
seem
so
pitiful
so
miserably
inadequate
do
you
know
ca
you
feel
what
you
are
to
me
tell
me
do
you
think
i
love
you
but
she
could
not
bear
to
meet
his
glance
just
yet
her
eyes
were
closed
and
she
could
only
nod
her
head
but
bennett
took
her
head
in
both
his
hands
and
turned
her
face
to
his
even
yet
she
kept
her
eyes
closed
lloyd
he
said
and
his
voice
was
almost
a
command
lloyd
look
at
me
do
you
love
me
she
drew
a
deep
breath
then
her
sweet
eyes
opened
and
through
the
tears
that
brimmed
them
and
wet
her
lashes
she
looked
at
him
and
met
his
glance
fearlessly
and
almost
proudly
and
her
voice
trembled
and
vibrated
with
an
infinite
tenderness
as
she
answered
i
do
love
you
ward
love
you
with
all
my
heart
then
after
a
pause
she
said
drawing
a
little
from
him
and
resting
a
hand
upon
either
shoulder
but
listen
dear
we
must
not
think
of
ourselves
now
we
must
think
of
him
so
sick
and
weak
and
helpless
this
is
a
terrible
moment
in
our
lives
i
do
know
why
it
has
come
to
us
i
do
know
why
it
should
all
have
happened
as
it
has
this
morning
just
a
few
moments
ago
i
was
angry
as
i
never
was
in
my
life
before
and
at
you
and
now
it
seems
to
me
that
i
never
was
so
happy
i
do
know
myself
any
more
everything
is
confused
all
we
can
do
is
to
hold
to
what
we
know
is
right
and
trust
that
everything
will
be
well
in
the
end
it
is
a
crisis
is
it
and
all
our
lives
and
all
our
happiness
depend
upon
how
we
meet
it
i
am
all
different
now
i
am
not
the
woman
i
was
a
ago
you
must
be
brave
for
me
now
and
you
must
be
strong
for
me
and
help
me
to
do
my
duty
we
must
live
up
to
the
best
that
is
in
us
and
do
what
we
think
is
right
no
matter
what
risks
we
run
no
matter
what
the
consequences
are
i
would
not
have
asked
you
to
help
me
before
before
what
has
happened
but
now
i
need
your
help
you
have
said
i
helped
you
to
be
brave
help
me
to
be
brave
now
and
to
do
what
i
know
is
right
but
bennett
was
still
blind
if
she
had
been
dear
to
him
before
how
doubly
so
had
she
become
since
she
had
confessed
her
love
for
him
ferriss
was
forgotten
ignored
he
could
not
let
her
go
he
could
not
let
her
run
the
slightest
risk
was
he
to
take
any
chance
of
losing
her
now
he
shook
his
head
ward
she
exclaimed
with
deep
and
serious
earnestness
if
you
do
not
wish
me
to
risk
my
life
by
going
to
my
post
be
careful
oh
be
very
careful
that
you
do
not
risk
something
that
is
more
to
us
both
than
life
itself
by
keeping
me
from
it
do
you
think
i
could
love
you
so
deeply
and
so
truly
as
i
do
if
i
had
not
kept
my
standards
high
if
i
had
not
believed
in
the
things
that
were
better
than
life
and
stronger
than
death
and
dearer
to
me
than
even
love
itself
there
are
some
things
i
can
not
do
i
can
not
be
false
i
can
not
be
cowardly
i
can
not
shirk
my
duty
now
i
am
helpless
in
your
hands
you
have
conquered
and
you
can
do
with
me
as
you
choose
but
if
you
make
me
do
what
is
false
and
what
is
cowardly
and
what
is
dishonourable
if
you
stand
between
me
and
what
i
know
is
my
duty
how
can
i
love
you
how
can
i
love
you
persistently
perversely
bennett
stopped
his
ears
to
every
consideration
to
every
argument
she
wished
to
hazard
her
life
that
was
all
he
understood
no
lloyd
he
answered
you
must
not
do
it
and
i
want
to
love
you
she
went
on
as
though
she
had
not
heard
i
want
you
to
be
everything
to
me
i
have
trusted
you
so
long
had
faith
in
you
so
long
i
do
want
to
think
of
you
as
the
man
who
failed
me
when
i
most
needed
his
help
who
made
me
do
the
thing
that
was
contemptible
and
unworthy
believe
me
she
went
on
with
sudden
energy
you
will
kill
my
love
for
you
if
you
persist
but
before
bennett
could
answer
there
was
a
cry
it
is
the
servant
exclaimed
lloyd
quickly
she
has
been
watching
there
in
the
room
with
him
nurse
miss
searight
came
the
cry
quick
there
is
something
wrong
i
do
know
oh
hurry
do
you
hear
cried
lloyd
it
is
the
crisis
he
may
be
dying
oh
ward
it
is
the
man
you
love
we
can
save
him
she
stamped
her
foot
in
the
frenzy
of
her
emotion
her
hands
twisting
together
i
go
i
forbid
you
to
keep
to
hinder
to
to
oh
what
is
to
become
of
us
if
you
love
me
if
you
love
him
will
you
let
me
go
bennett
put
his
hands
over
his
ears
his
eyes
closed
in
the
horror
of
that
moment
when
he
realised
that
no
matter
how
he
might
desire
it
he
could
not
waver
in
his
resolution
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
reason
must
give
way
but
he
set
his
back
to
the
door
his
hand
gripped
tight
upon
the
knob
and
through
his
set
teeth
his
answer
came
as
before
no
nurse
miss
searight
where
are
you
hurry
oh
hurry
will
you
let
me
go
no
lloyd
caught
at
his
hand
shut
so
desperately
upon
the
knob
striving
to
loosen
his
clasp
she
hardly
knew
what
she
was
doing
she
threw
her
arms
about
his
neck
imploring
commanding
now
submissive
now
imperious
her
voice
now
vibrating
with
anger
now
trembling
with
passionate
entreaty
you
are
not
only
killing
him
you
are
killing
my
love
for
you
will
you
let
me
go
the
love
that
is
so
dear
to
me
let
me
love
you

listen
to
me
do
make
me
hate
you
let
me
love
you
dear
hurry
oh
hurry

me
love

him
live
i
want
to
love
you
it
the
best
happiness
in
my
life
let
me
be
happy
ca
you
see
what
this
moment
is
to
mean
for
us
it
is
our
happiness
or
wretchedness
forever
will
you
let
me
go
no
for
the
last
time
ward
listen
it
is
my
love
for
you
and
his
life
do
crush
us
both
yes
and
yourself
you
who

are
so
powerful
do
trample
all
our
happiness
under
foot
hurry
hurry
oh
will
nobody
come
to
help
will
you
let
me
go
no
her
strength
seemed
all
at
once
to
leave
her
all
the
fabric
of
her
character
so
mercilessly
assaulted
appeared
in
that
moment
to
reel
topple
and
go
crashing
to
its
wreck
she
was
shattered
broken
humbled
and
beaten
down
to
the
dust
her
pride
was
gone
her
faith
in
herself
was
gone
her
fine
strong
energy
was
gone
the
pity
of
it
the
grief
of
it
all
that
she
held
dearest
her
fine
and
confident
steadfastness
the
great
love
that
had
brought
such
happiness
into
her
life
that
had
been
her
inspiration
all
torn
from
her
and
tossed
aside
like
chaff
and
her
patient
ferriss
the
man
who
loved
her
who
had
undergone
such
suffering
such
hardship
who
trusted
her
and
whom
it
was
her
duty
to
nurse
back
to
life
and
health
if
he
should
perish
for
want
of
her
care
then
what
infinite
sorrow
then
what
endless
remorse
then
what
long
agony
of
unavailing
regret
her
world
her
universe
grew
dark
to
her
she
was
driven
from
her
firm
stand
she
was
lost
she
was
whirled
away
away
with
the
storm
landmarks
obliterated
lights
gone
away
with
the
storm
out
into
the
darkness
out
into
the
void
out
into
the
waste
places
and
wilderness
and
trackless
desolation
hurry
oh
hurry
it
was
too
late
she
had
failed
the
mistake
had
been
made
the
question
had
been
decided
that
insensate
bestial
determination
had
beaten
down
opposition
had
carried
its
point
life
and
love
had
been
crushed
beneath
its
trampling
without
pity
without
hesitation
the
tragedy
of
the
hour
was
done
the
tragedy
of
the
long
years
to
come
was
just
beginning
lloyd
sank
down
in
the
chair
before
the
table
and
the
head
that
she
had
held
so
high
bowed
down
upon
her
folded
arms
the
violence
of
her
grief
shook
her
from
head
to
foot
like
a
dry
light
reed
her
heart
seemed
literally
to
be
breaking
she
must
set
her
teeth
with
all
her
strength
to
keep
from
groaning
aloud
from
crying
out
in
her
hopeless
sorrow
her
impotent
shame
and
despair
once
more
came
the
cry
for
help
then
the
house
fell
silent
the
minutes
passed
but
for
lloyd
stifled
grief
there
was
no
sound
bennett
leaning
heavily
against
the
door
his
great
shoulders
stooping
and
bent
his
face
ashen
his
eyes
fixed
did
not
move
he
did
not
speak
to
lloyd
there
was
no
word
of
comfort
he
could
address
to
her
that
would
have
seemed
the
last
mockery
he
had
prevailed
as
he
knew
he
should
as
he
knew
he
must
when
once
his
resolve
was
taken
the
force
that
once
it
was
unleashed
was
beyond
him
to
control
had
accomplished
its
purpose
his
will
remained
unbroken
but
at
what
cost
however
that
was
for
future
consideration
the
costs
had
he
not
his
whole
life
before
him
in
which
to
count
them
the
present
moment
still
called
upon
him
to
act
he
looked
at
his
watch
the
next
quarter
of
an
hour
was
all
a
confusion
to
him
its
incidents
refused
to
define
themselves
upon
his
memory
when
afterward
he
tried
to
recall
them
he
could
remember
however
that
when
he
helped
lloyd
into
the
carryall
that
was
to
take
her
to
the
depot
in
the
village
she
had
shrunk
from
his
touch
and
had
drawn
away
from
him
as
if
from
a
criminal
a
murderer
he
placed
her
satchel
on
the
front
seat
with
the
driver
and
got
up
beside
the
driver
himself
she
had
drawn
her
veil
over
her
face
and
during
the
drive
sat
silent
and
motionless
can
you
make
it
asked
bennett
of
the
driver
watch
in
hand
the
time
was
of
the
shortest
but
the
driver
put
the
whip
to
his
horses
and
at
a
run
they
reached
the
railway
station
a
few
moments
ahead
of
time
bennett
told
the
driver
to
wait
and
while
lloyd
remained
in
her
place
he
bought
her
ticket
for
the
city
then
he
went
to
the
telegraph
office
and
sent
a
peremptory
despatch
to
the
house
on
calumet
square
a
few
moments
later
the
train
had
come
and
gone
an
abrupt
eruption
of
roaring
iron
and
shrieking
steam
bennett
was
left
on
the
platform
alone
watching
it
lessen
to
a
smoky
blur
where
the
rails
converged
toward
the
horizon
for
an
instant
he
stood
watching
watching
a
resistless
force
whirling
her
away
out
of
his
reach
out
of
his
life
then
he
shook
himself
turning
sharply
about
back
to
the
doctor
house
now
he
commanded
the
driver
on
the
run
you
understand
but
the
other
protested
his
horses
were
all
but
exhausted
twice
they
had
covered
that
distance
at
top
speed
and
under
the
whip
he
refused
to
return
bennett
took
the
young
man
by
the
arm
and
lifted
him
from
his
seat
to
the
ground
then
he
sprang
to
his
place
and
lashed
the
horses
to
a
gallop
when
he
arrived
at
pitts
house
he
did
not
stop
to
tie
the
horses
but
threw
the
reins
over
their
backs
and
entered
the
front
hall
out
of
breath
and
panting
but
the
doctor
during
bennett
absence
had
returned
and
it
was
he
who
met
him
up
the
stairs
how
is
he
demanded
bennett
i
have
sent
for
another
nurse
she
will
be
out
here
on
the
next
train
i
wired
from
the
station
the
only
objection
to
that
answered
the
doctor
looking
fixedly
at
him
is
that
it
is
not
necessary
ferriss
has
just
died
vii
throughout
her
ride
from
medford
to
the
city
it
was
impossible
for
lloyd
so
great
was
the
confusion
in
her
mind
to
think
connectedly
she
had
been
so
fiercely
shocked
so
violently
shattered
and
weakened
that
for
a
time
she
lacked
the
power
and
even
the
desire
to
collect
and
to
concentrate
her
scattering
thoughts
for
the
time
being
she
felt
but
only
dimly
that
a
great
blow
had
fallen
that
a
great
calamity
had
overwhelmed
her
but
so
extraordinary
was
the
condition
of
her
mind
that
more
than
once
she
found
herself
calmly
awaiting
the
inevitable
moment
when
the
full
extent
of
the
catastrophe
would
burst
upon
her
for
the
moment
she
was
merely
tired
she
was
willing
even
to
put
off
this
reaction
for
a
while
willing
to
remain
passive
and
dizzied
and
stupefied
resigning
herself
helplessly
and
supinely
to
the
swift
current
of
events
yet
while
that
part
of
her
mind
which
registered
the
greater
deeper
and
more
lasting
impressions
remained
inactive
the
smaller
faculty
that
took
cognisance
of
the
little
matters
was
as
busy
and
bright
as
ever
it
appeared
that
the
blow
had
been
struck
over
this
latter
faculty
and
not
as
one
so
often
supposes
through
it
she
seemed
in
that
hour
to
understand
the
reasonableness
of
this
phenomenon
that
before
had
always
appeared
so
inexplicable
and
saw
how
great
sorrow
as
well
as
great
joy
strikes
only
at
the
greater
machinery
of
the
brain
overpassing
and
ignoring
the
little
wheels
and
cogs
that
work
on
as
briskly
as
ever
in
storm
or
calm
being
moved
only
by
temporary
and
trivial
emotions
and
impressions
so
it
was
that
for
upward
of
an
hour
while
the
train
carried
her
swiftly
back
to
the
city
lloyd
sat
quietly
in
her
place
watching
the
landscape
rushing
past
her
and
cut
into
regular
divisions
by
the
telegraph
poles
like
the
whirling
pictures
of
a
kinetoscope
she
noted
and
even
with
some
particularity
the
other
passengers
a
young
girl
in
a
smart
gown
reading
a
book
cutting
the
leaves
raggedly
with
a
hairpin
a
gentleman
with
a
large
stomach
who
breathed
loudly
through
his
nose
the
book
agent
with
his
oval
boxes
of
dried
figs
and
endless
thread
of
talk
a
woman
with
a
little
boy
who
wore
spectacles
and
who
was
continually
making
unsteady
raids
upon
the
and
the
brakeman
and
train
conductor
laughing
and
chatting
in
the
forward
seat
she
took
an
interest
in
every
unusual
feature
of
the
country
through
which
the
train
was
speeding
and
noted
each
stop
or
increase
of
speed
she
found
a
certain
diversion
as
she
had
often
done
before
in
watching
for
the
and
in
keeping
count
of
the
miles
she
even
asked
the
conductor
at
what
time
the
train
would
reach
the
city
and
uttered
a
little
murmur
of
vexation
when
she
was
told
that
it
was
a
late
the
next
instant
she
was
asking
herself
why
this
delay
should
seem
annoying
to
her
then
toward
the
close
of
the
afternoon
came
the
city
itself
first
a
smudge
on
the
horizon
then
a
world
of
grimy
streets
rows
of
miserable
tenements
festooned
with
rags
then
a
tunnel
or
two
and
at
length
the
echoing
terminal
of
the
station
lloyd
alighted
and
remembering
that
the
distance
was
short
walked
steadily
toward
her
destination
till
the
streets
and
neighbourhood
became
familiar
suddenly
she
came
into
the
square
directly
opposite
was
the
massive
granite
front
of
the
agency
she
paused
abruptly
she
was
returning
to
the
house
after
abandoning
her
post
what
was
she
to
say
to
them
the
other
women
of
her
profession
then
all
at
once
came
the
reaction
instantly
the
larger
machinery
of
the
mind
resumed
its
functions
the
hurt
of
the
blow
came
back
with
a
fierce
wrench
of
pain
the
wound
reopened
full
consciousness
returned
lloyd
remembered
then
that
she
had
proved
false
to
her
trust
at
a
moment
of
danger
that
ferriss
would
probably
die
because
of
what
she
had
done
that
her
strength
of
will
and
of
mind
wherein
she
had
gloried
was
broken
beyond
redemption
that
bennett
had
failed
her
that
her
love
for
him
the
one
great
happiness
of
her
life
was
dead
and
cold
and
could
never
be
revived
and
that
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
she
stood
dishonoured
and
disgraced
now
she
must
enter
that
house
now
she
must
face
its
inmates
her
companions
what
to
say
to
them
how
explain
her
defection
how
tell
them
that
she
had
not
left
her
post
of
her
own
will
lloyd
fancied
herself
saying
in
substance
that
the
man
who
loved
her
and
whom
she
loved
had
made
her
abandon
her
patient
she
set
her
teeth
no
not
that
confession
of
miserable
weakness
not
that
of
all
things
and
yet
the
other
alternative
what
was
that
it
could
be
only
that
she
had
been
afraid
she
lloyd
searight
must
she
who
had
been
the
bravest
of
them
all
stand
before
that
little
band
of
devoted
women
in
the
light
of
a
coward
she
remembered
the
case
of
the
young
english
woman
harriet
freeze
who
when
called
upon
to
nurse
a
smallpox
patient
had
been
found
wanting
in
courage
at
the
crucial
moment
and
had
discovered
an
excuse
for
leaving
her
post
miss
freeze
had
been
expelled
dishonourably
from
the
midst
of
her
companions
and
now
she
lloyd
standing
apparently
convicted
of
the
same
dishonour
must
face
the
same
tribunal
there
was
no
escape
she
must
enter
that
house
she
must
endure
that
ordeal
and
this
at
precisely
the
time
when
her
resolution
had
been
shattered
her
will
broken
her
courage
daunted
for
a
moment
the
idea
of
flight
suggested
itself
to
her
she
would
avoid
the
issue
she
would
hide
from
reproach
and
contumely
and
without
further
explanation
go
back
to
her
place
in
the
country
at
bannister
but
the
little
exigencies
of
her
position
made
this
impossible
besides
her
nurse
bag
her
satchel
was
the
only
baggage
she
had
at
that
moment
and
she
knew
that
there
was
but
little
money
in
her
purse
all
at
once
she
realised
that
while
debating
the
question
she
had
been
sitting
on
one
of
the
benches
under
the
trees
in
the
square
the
sun
was
setting
evening
was
coming
on
maybe
if
she
waited
until
six
she
could
enter
the
house
while
the
other
nurses
were
at
supper
gain
her
room
unobserved
then
lock
herself
in
and
deny
herself
to
all
callers
but
lloyd
made
a
weary
resigned
movement
of
her
shoulders
sooner
or
later
she
must
meet
them
all
eye
to
eye
it
would
be
only
putting
off
the
humiliation
she
rose
and
turning
to
the
house
began
to
walk
slowly
toward
it
why
put
it
off
it
would
be
as
hard
at
one
time
as
another
but
so
great
was
her
sense
of
shame
that
even
as
she
walked
she
fancied
that
the
very
the
loungers
on
the
benches
around
the
fountain
must
know
that
here
was
a
disgraced
woman
was
it
not
apparent
in
her
very
face
in
the
very
uncertainty
of
her
gait
she
told
herself
she
had
not
done
wisely
to
sit
even
for
a
moment
upon
the
bench
she
had
just
quitted
she
wondered
if
she
had
been
observed
and
furtively
glanced
about
her
there
was
not
that
nursemaid
studying
her
too
narrowly
and
the
policeman
close
at
hand
was
he
not
watching
her
quizzically
she
quickened
her
gait
moved
with
a
sudden
impulse
to
get
out
of
sight
to
hide
within
doors
where
in
the
house
there
where
so
soon
as
she
set
foot
in
it
her
companions
the
other
nurses
must
know
her
dishonour
where
was
she
to
go
where
to
turn
what
was
to
become
of
her
but
she
go
to
the
house
it
was
inevitable
she
went
forward
as
it
were
step
by
step
that
little
journey
across
the
square
under
the
elms
and
cottonwoods
was
for
her
a
veritable
de
la
every
step
was
an
agony
every
yard
covered
only
brought
her
nearer
the
time
and
place
of
exposure
it
was
all
the
more
humiliating
because
she
knew
that
her
impelling
motive
was
not
one
of
duty
there
was
nothing
lofty
in
the
matter
nothing
she
went
back
because
she
had
to
go
back
little
material
necessities
almost
ludicrous
in
their
pettiness
forced
her
on
as
she
came
nearer
she
looked
cautiously
at
the
windows
of
the
agency
who
would
be
the
first
to
note
her
would
it
be
miss
douglass
or
esther
thielman
or
miss
bergyn
the
superintendent
nurse
what
would
first
be
said
to
her
with
what
words
would
she
respond
then
how
the
news
of
the
betrayal
of
her
trust
would
flash
from
room
to
room
how
it
would
be
discussed
how
condemned
how
deplored
not
one
of
the
nurses
of
that
little
band
but
would
not
feel
herself
hurt
by
what
she
had
done
by
what
she
had
been
forced
to
do
and
the
news
of
her
failure
would
spread
to
all
her
acquaintances
and
friends
throughout
the
city
street
would
know
it
every
physician
to
whom
she
had
hitherto
been
so
welcome
an
aid
would
know
it
in
all
the
hospitals
it
would
be
a
nine
days
gossip
campbell
would
hear
of
it
and
hattie
all
at
once
within
thirty
feet
of
the
house
lloyd
turned
about
and
walked
rapidly
away
from
it
the
movement
was
all
but
involuntary
every
instinct
in
her
every
sense
of
shame
brusquely
revolted
it
was
stronger
than
she
a
power
for
the
moment
irresistible
dragged
her
back
from
that
doorway
once
entering
here
she
left
all
hope
behind
yet
the
threshold
must
be
crossed
yet
the
hope
must
be
abandoned
she
felt
that
if
she
faced
about
now
a
second
time
she
would
indeed
attract
attention
so
while
her
cheeks
flamed
hot
at
the
meanness
the
miserable
ridiculousness
of
the
imposture
she
assumed
a
brisk
determined
gait
as
though
she
knew
just
where
she
were
going
and
turning
out
of
the
square
down
a
walked
around
the
block
even
stopping
once
or
twice
before
a
store
pretending
an
interest
in
the
display
it
seemed
to
her
that
by
now
everybody
in
the
streets
must
have
noted
that
there
was
something
wrong
with
her
twice
as
a
brushed
past
her
she
looked
back
to
see
if
he
was
watching
her
how
to
live
through
the
next
ten
minutes
if
she
were
only
in
her
room
bolted
in
locked
and
in
why
was
there
not
some
back
way
through
which
she
could
creep
to
that
seclusion
and
so
it
was
that
lloyd
came
back
to
the
house
she
had
built
to
the
little
community
she
had
so
proudly
organised
to
the
agency
she
had
founded
and
with
her
own
money
endowed
and
supported
at
last
she
found
herself
at
the
bottom
of
the
steps
her
foot
upon
the
lowest
one
her
hand
clasping
the
heavy
bronze
rail
there
was
no
going
back
now
she
went
up
and
pushed
the
button
of
the
electric
bell
and
then
the
step
once
taken
the
irrevocable
once
dared
something
like
the
calmness
of
resignation
came
to
her
there
was
no
help
for
it
now
for
the
ordeal
rownie
opened
the
door
for
her
with
a
cheery
welcome
lloyd
was
dimly
conscious
that
the
girl
said
something
about
her
mail
and
that
she
was
just
in
time
for
supper
but
the
hall
and
stairway
were
deserted
and
empty
while
from
the
came
a
subdued
murmur
of
conversation
and
the
clink
of
dishes
the
nurses
were
at
supper
as
lloyd
had
hoped
the
moment
favoured
her
and
she
brushed
by
rownie
and
almost
ran
and
trembling
up
the
stairs
she
gained
the
hall
of
the
second
floor
there
was
the
door
of
her
room
standing
ajar
with
a
little
gasp
of
infinite
relief
she
hurried
to
it
entered
shut
and
locked
and
bolted
it
behind
her
and
casting
her
satchel
and
handbag
from
her
flung
herself
down
upon
the
great
couch
and
buried
her
head
deep
among
the
cushions
at
lloyd
abrupt
entrance
miss
douglass
turned
about
from
the
in
an
angle
of
the
room
and
stared
a
moment
in
no
little
surprise
then
she
exclaimed
why
lloyd
why
what
is
it
what
is
the
matter
lloyd
sprang
up
sharply
at
the
sound
of
her
voice
and
then
sank
down
to
a
sitting
posture
upon
the
edge
of
the
couch
quietly
enough
she
said
oh
is
it
you
i
did
know
expect
to
find
any
one
you
do
mind
do
you
i
just
ran
in
to
get
a
book
something
to
read
i
had
a
headache
all
day
and
did
go
down
to
supper
lloyd
nodded
of
course
i
do
mind
she
said
a
little
wearily
but
tell
me
continued
the
fever
nurse
whatever
is
the
matter
when
you
came
in
just
now
i
never
saw
you
so
oh
i
understand
your
case
at
medford
lloyd
hands
closed
tight
upon
the
edge
of
the
couch
no
one
could
have
got
a
patient
through
when
the
fever
had
got
as
far
as
that
continued
the
other
this
must
have
been
the
fifth
or
sixth
week
the
second
telegram
came
just
in
time
to
prevent
my
going
i
was
just
going
out
of
the
door
when
the
boy
came
with
it
you
what
telegram
inquired
lloyd
yes
i
was
on
call
the
first
despatch
asking
for
another
extra
nurse
came
about
two
the
was
the
first
train
i
could
have
taken
the
express
is
a
through
train
and
do
stop
at
medford
and
as
i
say
i
was
just
going
out
of
the
door
when
pitts
second
despatch
came
countermanding
the
first
and
telling
us
that
the
patient
had
died
it
seems
that
it
was
one
of
the
officers
of
the
freja
expedition
we
did
know
died
interrupted
lloyd
looking
fixedly
at
her
but
lloyd
you
must
take
it
so
to
heart
you
could
have
got
him
through
no
one
could
at
that
time
he
was
probably
dying
when
you
were
sent
for
we
must
all
lose
a
case
now
and
then
died
repeated
lloyd
pitts
wired
that
ferriss
died
yes
it
was
to
prevent
my
coming
out
there
uselessly
he
must
have
sent
the
wire
quite
an
hour
before
you
left
it
was
very
thoughtful
of
him
he
dead
said
lloyd
in
a
low
expressionless
voice
looking
vacantly
about
the
room
ferriss
is
dead
then
suddenly
she
put
a
fist
to
either
temple
and
for
the
moment
shaken
with
hysteria
from
head
to
foot
her
eyes
widening
with
an
expression
almost
of
terror
dead
she
cried
oh
it
horrible
why
did
i
why
could
i
i
know
just
how
you
feel
answered
miss
douglass
soothingly
i
am
that
way
myself
sometimes
it
not
professional
i
know
but
when
you
have
been
successful
in
two
or
three
bad
cases
you
think
you
can
always
win
and
then
when
you
lose
the
next
case
you
believe
that
somehow
it
must
have
been
your
fault
that
if
you
had
been
a
little
more
careful
at
just
that
moment
or
done
a
little
different
in
that
particular
point
you
might
have
saved
your
patient
but
you
of
all
people
ought
not
to
feel
like
that
if
you
could
not
have
saved
your
case
nobody
could
it
was
just
because
i
had
the
case
that
it
was
lost
nonsense
lloyd
do
talk
like
that
you
not
had
enough
sleep
your
nerves
have
been
you
worn
out
and
a
little
hysterical
and
morbid
now
lie
down
and
keep
quiet
and
i
bring
you
your
supper
you
need
a
good
night
sleep
and
bromide
of
potassium
when
she
had
gone
lloyd
rose
to
her
feet
and
drew
her
hand
wearily
across
her
eyes
the
situation
adjusted
itself
in
her
mind
after
the
first
recoil
of
horror
at
ferriss
death
she
was
able
to
see
the
false
position
in
which
she
stood
she
had
been
so
certain
already
that
ferriss
would
die
leaving
him
as
she
did
at
so
critical
a
moment
that
now
the
sharpness
of
miss
douglass
news
was
blunted
a
little
she
had
only
been
unprepared
for
the
suddenness
of
the
shock
but
now
she
understood
clearly
how
miss
douglass
had
been
deceived
by
circumstances
the
fever
nurse
had
heard
of
ferriss
death
early
in
the
afternoon
and
supposed
of
course
that
lloyd
had
left
the
case
and
not
before
it
had
occurred
this
was
the
story
the
other
nurses
would
believe
instantly
in
the
flood
of
grief
and
remorse
and
humiliation
that
had
overwhelmed
her
lloyd
caught
at
this
straw
of
hope
only
pitts
and
bennett
knew
the
real
facts
bennett
of
course
would
not
speak
and
lloyd
knew
that
the
physician
would
understand
the
cruelty
and
injustice
of
her
situation
and
because
of
that
would
also
keep
silence
to
make
sure
of
this
she
could
write
him
a
letter
or
better
still
see
him
personally
it
would
be
hard
to
tell
him
the
truth
but
that
was
nothing
when
compared
with
the
world
denunciation
of
her
if
she
had
really
been
false
to
her
charge
if
she
had
actually
flinched
and
faltered
at
the
crucial
moment
had
truly
been
the
coward
this
deception
which
had
been
thrust
upon
her
at
the
moment
of
her
return
to
the
house
this
part
which
it
was
so
easy
to
play
would
have
been
a
hideous
and
unspeakable
hypocrisy
but
lloyd
had
not
faltered
had
not
been
false
in
her
heart
of
hearts
she
had
been
true
to
herself
and
to
her
trust
how
would
she
deceive
her
companions
then
by
allowing
them
to
continue
in
the
belief
of
her
constancy
fidelity
and
courage
what
she
hid
from
them
or
rather
what
they
could
not
see
was
a
state
of
things
that
it
was
impossible
for
any
one
but
herself
to
understand
she
could
not
no
woman
could
bring
herself
to
confess
to
another
woman
what
had
happened
that
day
at
medford
it
would
be
believed
that
she
could
have
stayed
at
her
patient
bedside
if
she
had
so
desired
no
one
who
did
not
know
bennett
could
understand
the
terrible
vast
force
of
the
man
try
as
she
would
lloyd
could
not
but
think
first
of
herself
at
this
moment
bennett
was
ignored
forgotten
once
she
had
loved
him
but
that
was
all
over
now
the
thought
of
ferriss
death
for
which
in
a
manner
she
had
been
forced
to
be
responsible
came
rushing
to
her
mind
from
time
to
time
and
filled
her
with
a
horror
and
at
times
even
a
perverse
sense
of
remorse
almost
beyond
words
but
lloyd
pride
her
her
strength
of
character
and
independence
had
been
dearer
to
her
than
almost
anything
in
life
so
she
told
herself
and
at
that
moment
honestly
believed
and
though
she
knew
that
her
pride
had
been
humbled
it
was
not
gone
and
enough
of
it
remained
to
make
her
desire
and
strive
to
keep
the
fact
a
secret
from
the
world
it
seemed
very
easy
she
would
only
have
to
remain
passive
circumstances
acted
for
her
miss
douglass
returned
followed
by
rownie
carrying
a
tray
when
the
mulatto
had
gone
after
arranging
lloyd
supper
on
a
little
table
near
the
couch
the
fever
nurse
drew
up
a
chair
now
we
can
talk
she
said
unless
you
are
too
tired
i
been
so
interested
in
this
case
at
medford
tell
me
what
was
the
immediate
cause
of
death
was
it
perforation
or
just
gradual
collapse
it
was
neither
said
lloyd
quickly
it
was
a
hemorrhage
she
had
uttered
the
words
with
as
little
consciousness
as
a
phonograph
and
the
lie
had
escaped
her
before
she
was
aware
how
did
she
know
what
had
been
the
immediate
cause
of
death
what
right
had
she
to
speak
why
was
it
that
all
at
once
a
falsehood
had
come
so
easy
to
her
to
her
whose
whole
life
until
then
had
been
so
sincere
so
genuine
a
hemorrhage
repeated
the
other
had
there
been
many
before
then
was
there
coma
vigil
when
the
end
came
i
oh
cried
lloyd
with
a
quick
gesture
of
impatience
do
do
ask
me
any
more
i
am
tired
nervous
i
am
worn
out
yes
of
course
you
must
be
answered
the
fever
nurse
we
wo
talk
any
more
about
it
that
night
and
the
following
day
were
terrible
lloyd
neither
ate
nor
slept
not
once
did
she
set
foot
out
of
her
room
giving
out
that
she
was
ill
which
was
not
far
from
the
truth
and
keeping
to
herself
and
to
the
companionship
of
the
thoughts
and
terrors
that
crowded
her
mind
until
that
day
at
medford
her
life
had
run
easily
and
happily
and
in
channels
she
was
successful
in
her
chosen
profession
and
work
she
imagined
herself
to
be
stronger
and
of
finer
fibre
than
most
other
women
and
her
love
for
bennett
had
lent
a
happiness
and
a
sweetness
to
her
life
dear
to
her
beyond
all
words
suddenly
and
within
an
hour
time
she
had
lost
everything
her
will
had
been
broken
her
spirit
crushed
she
had
been
forced
to
become
fearfully
instrumental
in
causing
the
death
of
her
patient
a
man
who
loved
and
trusted
her
while
her
love
for
bennett
which
for
years
had
been
her
deep
and
abiding
joy
the
one
great
influence
of
her
life
was
cold
and
dead
and
could
never
be
revived
this
in
the
end
came
to
be
lloyd
greatest
grief
she
could
forget
that
she
herself
had
been
humbled
and
broken
horrible
unspeakably
horrible
as
ferriss
death
seemed
to
her
it
was
upon
bennett
and
not
upon
her
that
its
responsibility
must
be
laid
she
had
done
what
she
could
of
that
she
was
assured
but
first
and
above
all
things
lloyd
was
a
woman
and
her
love
for
bennett
was
a
very
different
matter
when
during
that
scene
in
the
of
the
doctor
house
she
had
warned
bennett
that
if
he
persisted
in
his
insane
resolution
he
would
stamp
out
her
affection
for
him
lloyd
had
only
half
believed
what
she
said
but
when
at
last
it
dawned
upon
her
that
she
had
spoken
wiser
than
she
knew
that
this
was
actually
true
and
that
now
no
matter
how
she
might
desire
it
she
could
not
love
him
any
longer
it
seemed
as
though
her
heart
must
break
it
was
precisely
as
though
bennett
himself
the
bennett
she
had
known
had
been
blotted
out
of
existence
it
was
much
worse
than
if
bennett
had
merely
died
even
then
he
would
have
still
existed
for
her
somewhere
as
it
was
the
man
she
had
known
simply
ceased
to
be
irrevocably
finally
and
the
warmth
of
her
love
dwindled
and
grew
cold
because
now
there
was
nothing
left
for
it
to
feed
upon
never
until
then
had
lloyd
realised
how
much
he
had
been
to
her
how
he
had
not
only
played
so
large
a
part
in
her
life
but
how
he
had
become
a
very
part
of
her
life
itself
her
love
for
him
had
been
like
the
air
like
the
sunlight
was
delicately
knitted
and
intertwined
into
all
the
innumerable
intricacies
of
her
life
and
character
literally
not
an
hour
had
ever
passed
that
directly
or
indirectly
he
had
not
occupied
her
thoughts
he
had
been
her
inspiration
he
had
made
her
want
to
be
brave
and
strong
and
determined
and
it
was
because
of
him
that
the
greater
things
of
the
world
interested
her
she
had
chosen
a
work
to
be
done
because
he
had
set
her
an
example
so
only
that
she
preserved
her
womanliness
she
too
wanted
to
count
to
help
on
to
have
her
place
in
the
world
progress
in
reality
all
her
ambitions
and
hopes
had
been
looking
toward
one
end
only
that
she
might
be
his
equal
that
he
might
find
in
her
a
companion
and
a
confidante
one
who
could
share
his
enthusiasms
and
understand
his
vast
projects
and
great
aims
and
how
had
he
treated
her
when
at
last
opportunity
had
been
given
her
to
play
her
part
to
be
courageous
and
strong
to
prevail
against
great
odds
while
he
stood
by
to
see
he
had
ignored
and
misunderstood
and
tossed
aside
as
childish
and
absurd
that
which
she
had
been
building
up
for
years
instead
of
appreciating
her
heroism
he
had
forced
her
to
become
a
coward
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
she
had
hoped
to
be
his
equal
and
he
had
treated
her
as
a
it
had
all
been
a
mistake
she
was
not
and
could
not
be
the
woman
she
had
hoped
he
was
not
and
never
had
been
the
man
she
had
imagined
they
had
nothing
in
common
but
it
was
not
easy
to
give
bennett
up
to
let
him
pass
out
of
her
life
she
wanted
to
love
him
yet
with
all
her
heart
and
strength
in
spite
of
everything
woman
that
she
was
she
had
come
to
that
in
spite
of
everything
she
wanted
to
love
him
though
he
had
broken
her
will
thwarted
her
ambitions
ignored
her
cherished
hopes
misunderstood
and
mistaken
her
yet
if
she
could
lloyd
would
yet
have
loved
him
loved
him
even
for
the
very
fact
that
he
had
been
stronger
than
she
again
and
again
she
tried
to
awaken
this
dead
affection
to
call
back
this
vanished
love
she
tried
to
remember
the
bennett
she
had
known
she
told
herself
that
he
loved
her
that
he
had
said
that
the
great
things
he
had
done
had
been
done
only
with
an
eye
to
her
approval
that
she
had
been
his
inspiration
no
less
than
he
had
been
hers
that
he
had
fought
his
way
back
not
only
to
life
but
to
her
she
thought
of
all
he
had
suffered
of
the
hardships
and
privations
beyond
her
imagination
to
conceive
that
he
had
undergone
she
tried
to
recall
the
infinite
joy
of
that
night
when
the
news
of
his
safe
return
had
come
to
her
she
thought
of
him
at
his
very
best
how
he
had
always
seemed
to
her
the
type
of
the
perfect
man
masterful
aggressive
accomplishing
great
projects
with
an
energy
and
determination
almost
superhuman
one
of
the
world
great
men
whose
name
the
world
still
shouted
she
called
to
mind
how
the
very
ruggedness
of
his
face
with
its
massive
lines
and
harsh
angles
had
attracted
her
how
she
had
been
proud
of
his
giant
strength
the
vast
span
of
his
shoulders
the
depth
of
his
chest
the
sense
of
enormous
physical
power
suggested
by
his
every
movement
but
it
was
all
of
no
effect
that
bennett
was
worse
than
dead
to
her
the
bennett
that
now
came
to
her
mind
and
imagination
was
the
brutal
perverse
man
of
the
at
medford
coarse
insolent
intractable
stamping
out
all
that
was
finest
in
her
breaking
and
flinging
away
the
very
gifts
he
had
inspired
her
to
offer
him
it
was
nothing
to
him
that
she
should
stand
degraded
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
he
did
not
want
her
to
be
brave
and
strong
she
had
been
wrong
it
was
not
that
kind
of
woman
he
desired
he
had
not
acknowledged
that
she
too
as
well
as
he
a
woman
as
well
as
a
man
might
have
her
principles
her
standards
of
honour
her
ideas
of
duty
it
was
not
her
character
then
that
he
prized
the
nobility
of
her
nature
was
nothing
to
him
he
took
no
thought
of
the
texture
of
her
mind
how
then
did
she
appeal
to
him
it
was
not
her
mind
it
was
not
her
soul
what
then
was
left
nothing
but
the
physical
the
shame
of
it
the
degradation
of
it
to
be
so
cruelly
mistaken
in
the
man
she
loved
to
be
able
to
appeal
to
him
only
on
his
lower
side
lloyd
clasped
her
hands
over
her
eyes
shutting
her
teeth
hard
against
a
cry
of
grief
and
pain
and
impotent
anger
no
no
now
it
was
irrevocable
now
her
eyes
were
opened
the
bennett
she
had
known
and
loved
had
been
merely
a
creature
of
her
own
imagining
the
real
man
had
suddenly
discovered
himself
and
this
man
in
spite
of
herself
she
hated
as
a
victim
hates
its
tyrant
but
her
grief
for
her
vanished
happiness
the
happiness
that
this
love
however
mistaken
had
brought
into
her
life
was
pitiful
lloyd
could
not
think
of
it
without
the
choke
coming
to
her
throat
and
the
tears
brimming
her
eyes
while
at
times
a
veritable
paroxysm
of
sorrow
seized
upon
her
and
flung
her
at
full
length
upon
her
couch
her
face
buried
and
her
whole
body
shaken
with
stifled
sobs
it
was
gone
it
was
gone
and
could
never
be
called
back
what
was
there
now
left
to
her
to
live
for
why
continue
her
profession
why
go
on
with
the
work
what
pleasure
now
in
striving
and
overcoming
where
now
was
the
exhilaration
of
battle
with
the
enemy
even
supposing
she
yet
had
the
strength
to
continue
the
fight
who
was
there
now
to
please
to
approve
to
encourage
to
what
end
the
days
of
grave
responsibilities
the
long
still
nights
of
vigil
she
began
to
doubt
herself
bennett
the
man
had
loved
his
work
for
its
own
sake
but
how
about
herself
the
woman
in
what
spirit
had
she
gone
about
her
work
had
she
been
genuine
after
all
had
she
not
undertaken
it
rather
as
a
means
than
as
an
end
not
because
she
cared
for
it
but
because
she
thought
he
would
approve
because
she
had
hoped
by
means
of
the
work
she
would
come
into
closer
companionship
with
him
she
wondered
if
this
must
always
be
so
the
man
loving
the
work
for
the
work
sake
the
woman
more
complex
weaker
and
more
dependent
doing
the
work
only
in
reference
to
the
man
but
often
she
distrusted
her
own
conclusions
and
no
doubt
rightly
so
her
mind
was
yet
too
confused
to
reason
calmly
soberly
and
accurately
her
distress
was
yet
too
keen
too
poignant
to
permit
her
to
be
logical
at
one
time
she
was
almost
ready
to
admit
that
she
had
misjudged
bennett
that
though
he
had
acted
cruelly
and
unjustly
he
had
done
what
he
thought
was
best
his
sacrifice
of
ferriss
was
sufficient
guarantee
of
his
sincerity
but
this
mistrust
of
herself
did
not
affect
her
feeling
toward
him
there
were
moments
when
she
condoned
his
offence
there
was
never
an
instant
she
did
not
hate
him
and
this
sentiment
of
hatred
itself
independent
of
and
apart
from
its
object
was
distasteful
and
foreign
to
her
never
in
her
life
had
lloyd
hated
any
one
before
to
be
kind
to
be
gentle
to
be
womanly
was
her
second
nature
and
kindness
gentleness
and
womanliness
were
qualities
that
her
profession
only
intensified
and
deepened
this
newcomer
in
her
heart
this
fierce
evil
visitor
that
goaded
her
and
pricked
and
harried
her
from
day
to
day
and
throughout
so
many
waking
nights
that
roused
the
unwonted
flash
in
her
eye
and
drove
the
hot
angry
blood
to
her
smooth
white
forehead
and
knotted
her
levelled
brows
to
a
dark
and
lowering
frown
had
entered
her
life
and
being
unsought
for
and
undesired
it
did
not
belong
to
her
world
yet
there
it
sat
on
its
usurped
throne
deformed
and
hideous
driving
out
all
tenderness
and
compunction
ruling
her
with
a
rod
of
iron
hardening
her
embittering
her
and
belittling
her
making
a
mockery
of
all
sweetness
fleering
at
nobility
and
magnanimity
lowering
the
queen
to
the
level
of
the
fishwife
when
the
first
shock
of
the
catastrophe
had
spent
its
strength
and
lloyd
perforce
must
turn
again
to
the
life
she
had
to
live
groping
for
its
scattered
tangled
ends
piecing
together
again
as
best
she
might
its
broken
fragments
she
set
herself
honestly
to
drive
this
hatred
from
her
heart
if
she
could
not
love
bennett
at
least
she
need
not
hate
him
she
was
moved
to
this
by
no
feeling
of
concern
for
bennett
it
was
not
a
consideration
that
she
owed
to
him
but
something
rather
that
was
due
to
herself
yet
try
as
she
would
the
hatred
still
remained
she
could
not
put
it
from
her
hurt
her
and
contaminate
her
as
it
did
in
spite
of
all
her
best
efforts
in
spite
of
her
very
prayers
the
evil
thing
abode
with
her
strong
malignant
she
saw
that
in
the
end
she
would
continue
in
her
profession
but
she
believed
that
she
could
not
go
on
with
it
consistently
based
as
it
was
upon
sympathy
and
love
and
kindness
while
a
active
hatred
dwelt
with
her
harassing
her
at
every
moment
and
perverting
each
good
impulse
and
each
unselfish
desire
it
was
an
ally
of
the
very
enemy
she
would
be
called
upon
to
fight
a
traitor
that
at
any
moment
might
open
the
gates
to
his
triumphant
entry
but
was
this
his
only
ally
was
this
the
only
false
and
ugly
invader
that
had
taken
advantage
of
her
shattered
defence
had
the
unwelcome
visitor
entered
her
heart
alone
was
there
not
a
companion
still
more
wicked
more
perverted
more
insidious
more
dangerous
for
the
first
time
lloyd
knew
what
it
meant
to
deceive
it
was
supposed
by
her
companions
and
accepted
by
them
as
a
matter
of
course
that
she
had
not
left
the
bedside
of
her
patient
until
after
his
death
at
first
she
had
joyfully
welcomed
this
mistake
as
her
salvation
the
one
happy
coincidence
that
was
to
make
her
life
possible
and
for
a
time
had
ceased
to
think
about
it
that
phase
of
the
incident
was
closed
matters
would
readjust
themselves
in
a
few
days
time
the
incident
would
be
forgotten
but
she
found
that
she
herself
could
not
forget
it
and
that
as
days
went
on
the
idea
of
this
passive
silent
deception
she
was
obliged
to
maintain
occurred
to
her
oftener
and
oftener
she
remembered
again
how
glibly
and
easily
she
had
lied
to
her
friend
upon
the
evening
of
her
return
how
was
it
that
the
lie
had
flowed
so
smoothly
from
her
lips
to
her
knowledge
she
had
never
deliberately
lied
before
she
would
have
supposed
that
because
of
this
fact
falsehood
would
come
difficult
to
her
that
she
would
have
bungled
hesitated
stammered
but
it
was
the
reverse
that
had
been
the
case
the
facility
with
which
she
had
uttered
the
lie
was
what
now
began
to
disturb
and
to
alarm
her
it
argued
some
sudden
collapse
of
her
whole
system
of
morals
some
fundamental
disarrangement
of
the
entire
machine
abruptly
she
recoiled
whither
was
she
tending
if
she
supinely
resigned
herself
to
the
current
of
circumstance
where
would
she
be
carried
yet
how
was
she
to
free
herself
from
the
current
how
to
face
this
new
situation
that
suddenly
presented
itself
at
a
time
when
she
had
fancied
the
real
shock
of
battle
and
contention
was
spent
and
past
how
was
she
to
go
back
now
how
could
she
retrace
her
steps
there
was
but
one
way
correct
the
false
impression
it
would
not
be
necessary
to
acknowledge
that
she
had
been
forced
to
leave
her
post
the
essential
was
that
her
companions
should
know
that
she
had
deceived
them
that
she
had
left
the
bedside
before
her
patient
death
but
at
the
thought
of
making
such
confession
public
as
it
must
be
everything
that
was
left
of
her
wounded
pride
revolted
she
who
had
been
so
firm
she
who
had
held
so
tenaciously
to
her
principles
she
who
had
posed
before
them
as
an
example
of
devotion
and
courage
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
that
no
no
she
exclaimed
as
this
alternative
presented
itself
to
her
mind
no
i
can
not
it
is
beyond
me
i
simply
can
not
do
it
but
she
could
yes
she
could
do
it
if
she
would
deep
down
in
her
mind
that
little
thought
arose
she
could
if
she
wanted
to
hide
it
though
she
might
cover
it
and
bury
it
with
what
false
reasoning
she
could
invent
the
little
thought
would
not
be
smothered
would
not
be
crushed
out
well
then
she
would
not
was
it
not
her
chance
was
not
this
deception
which
others
and
not
herself
had
created
her
opportunity
to
recover
herself
to
live
down
what
had
been
done
what
she
had
been
forced
to
do
rather
absolute
right
was
never
to
be
attained
was
not
life
to
be
considered
rather
in
the
light
of
a
compromise
between
good
and
evil
to
do
what
one
could
under
the
circumstances
was
not
that
the
golden
mean
but
she
ought
and
quick
another
little
thought
sprang
up
in
the
deeper
recesses
of
her
mind
and
took
its
place
beside
the
other
it
was
right
that
she
should
be
true
she
ought
to
do
the
right
argument
the
pleas
of
weakness
the
demands
of
expediency
the
plausibility
of
compromise
were
all
of
no
avail
the
idea
i
ought
persisted
and
persisted
and
persisted
she
could
and
she
ought
there
was
no
excuse
for
her
and
no
sooner
had
she
thrust
aside
the
shifty
mass
of
sophistries
under
which
she
had
striven
to
conceal
them
no
sooner
had
she
let
in
the
light
than
these
two
conceptions
of
duty
and
will
began
suddenly
to
grow
but
what
was
she
to
gain
what
would
be
the
result
of
such
a
course
as
her
conscience
demanded
she
should
adopt
it
was
inevitable
that
she
would
be
misunderstood
cruelly
misjudged
what
action
would
her
confession
entail
she
could
not
say
but
results
did
not
matter
what
she
was
to
gain
or
lose
did
not
matter
around
her
and
before
her
all
was
dark
and
vague
and
terrible
if
she
was
to
escape
there
was
but
one
thing
to
do
suddenly
her
own
words
came
back
to
her
all
we
can
do
is
to
hold
to
what
we
know
is
right
and
trust
that
everything
will
come
well
in
the
end
she
knew
what
was
right
and
she
had
the
strength
to
hold
to
it
then
all
at
once
there
came
to
lloyd
a
grand
breathless
sense
of
uplifting
almost
a
transfiguration
she
felt
herself
carried
high
above
the
sphere
of
little
things
the
region
of
petty
considerations
what
did
she
care
for
consequences
what
mattered
to
her
the
unjust
condemnation
of
her
world
if
only
she
remained
true
to
herself
if
only
she
did
right
what
did
she
care
for
what
she
gained
it
was
no
longer
a
question
of
gain
or
loss
it
was
a
question
of
being
true
and
strong
and
brave
the
conflict
of
that
day
at
medford
between
the
man
power
and
the
resistance
had
been
cruel
the
crisis
had
been
intense
and
though
she
had
been
conquered
then
had
it
after
all
been
beyond
recall
no
she
was
not
conquered
no
she
was
not
subdued
her
will
had
not
been
broken
her
courage
had
not
been
daunted
her
strength
had
not
been
weakened
here
was
the
greater
fight
here
was
the
higher
test
here
was
the
ultimate
supreme
crisis
of
all
and
here
at
last
come
what
might
she
would
not
would
not
would
not
fail
as
soon
as
lloyd
reached
this
conclusion
she
sat
about
carrying
her
resolution
into
effect
if
i
do
do
it
now
while
i
strong
she
told
herself
if
i
wait
i
never
will
do
it
perhaps
there
was
yet
a
touch
of
the
hysterical
in
her
actions
even
then
the
jangled
feminine
nerves
were
yet
vibrating
far
above
their
normal
pitch
she
was
overwrought
and
oversensitive
for
just
as
a
fanatic
rushes
eagerly
upon
the
fire
and
the
steel
preferring
the
more
exquisite
torture
so
lloyd
sought
out
the
more
painful
situation
the
more
trying
ordeal
the
line
of
action
that
called
for
the
greatest
fortitude
the
most
unflinching
courage
she
chose
to
make
known
her
real
position
to
correct
the
false
impression
at
a
time
when
all
the
nurses
of
the
house
should
be
together
this
would
be
at
since
her
return
from
medford
lloyd
had
shut
herself
away
from
the
other
inmates
of
the
house
and
had
taken
her
meals
in
her
room
with
the
exception
of
miss
douglass
and
the
superintendent
nurse
no
one
had
seen
her
she
had
passed
her
time
lying
at
full
length
upon
her
couch
her
hands
clasped
behind
her
head
or
pacing
the
floor
or
gazing
listlessly
out
of
her
windows
while
her
thoughts
raced
at
a
gallop
through
her
mind
now
however
she
bestirred
herself
she
had
arrived
at
her
final
decision
early
in
the
afternoon
of
the
third
day
after
her
return
and
at
once
she
resolved
that
she
would
endure
the
ordeal
that
very
evening
she
passed
the
intervening
time
singularly
enough
in
very
carefully
setting
her
room
to
rights
adjusting
and
readjusting
the
few
ornaments
on
the
and
walls
winding
the
clock
that
struck
bells
instead
of
the
hours
and
minutely
sorting
the
letters
and
papers
in
her
desk
it
was
the
same
as
if
she
were
going
upon
a
long
journey
or
were
preparing
for
a
great
sickness
toward
four
miss
douglass
looking
in
to
ask
how
she
did
found
her
before
her
mirror
carefully
combing
and
arranging
her
great
bands
and
braids
of
hair
the
fever
nurse
declared
that
she
was
immensely
improved
in
appearance
and
asked
at
once
if
she
was
not
feeling
better
yes
answered
lloyd
very
much
better
adding
i
shall
be
down
to
supper
for
some
reason
that
she
could
not
explain
lloyd
took
unusual
pains
with
her
toilet
debating
long
over
each
detail
of
dress
and
ornament
at
length
toward
five
she
was
ready
and
sat
down
by
her
window
a
book
in
her
lap
to
await
the
announcement
of
supper
as
the
condemned
await
the
summons
to
execution
her
plan
was
to
delay
her
appearance
in
the
until
she
was
sure
that
everybody
was
present
then
she
would
go
down
and
standing
there
before
them
all
say
what
she
had
to
say
state
the
few
bald
facts
of
the
case
without
excuse
or
palliation
and
leave
them
to
draw
the
one
inevitable
conclusion
but
this
final
hour
of
waiting
was
a
long
agony
for
lloyd
her
moods
changed
with
every
moment
the
action
she
contemplated
presented
itself
to
her
mind
in
a
multitude
of
varying
lights
at
one
time
she
quivered
with
the
apprehension
of
it
as
though
at
the
slow
approach
of
hot
irons
at
another
she
could
see
no
reason
for
being
greatly
concerned
over
the
matter
did
the
whole
affair
amount
to
so
much
after
all
her
companions
would
of
their
own
accord
make
excuses
for
her
risking
one
life
in
the
case
of
a
virulent
contagious
disease
was
no
small
matter
no
one
could
be
blamed
for
leaving
such
a
case
at
one
moment
lloyd
idea
of
public
confession
seemed
to
her
little
less
than
sublime
at
another
almost
ridiculous
but
she
remembered
the
case
of
harriet
freeze
who
had
been
unable
to
resist
the
quiet
unexpressed
force
of
opinion
of
her
it
would
be
strange
if
lloyd
should
find
herself
driven
from
the
very
house
she
had
built
the
hour
before
seemed
interminable
the
quarter
passed
then
the
half
then
the
lloyd
imagined
she
began
to
detect
a
faint
odour
of
the
kitchen
in
the
air
suddenly
the
remaining
minutes
of
the
hour
began
to
be
stricken
from
the
dial
of
her
clock
with
bewildering
rapidity
from
the
immediately
below
came
the
sounds
of
the
piano
that
was
esther
thielman
no
doubt
playing
one
of
her
interminable
polish
compositions
all
at
once
the
piano
stopped
and
with
a
quick
sinking
of
the
heart
lloyd
heard
the
sliding
doors
separating
the
from
the
roll
back
miss
douglass
and
another
one
of
the
nurses
miss
truslow
a
young
girl
a
newcomer
in
the
house
came
out
of
the
former
room
and
went
downstairs
discussing
the
merits
of
burlap
as
preferable
to
lloyd
even
heard
miss
truslow
remark
yes
that
very
true
but
if
it
is
sized
it
will
wrinkle
in
damp
weather
rownie
came
to
lloyd
door
and
knocked
and
without
waiting
for
a
reply
said
dinneh
served
miss
searight
and
lloyd
heard
her
make
the
same
announcement
at
miss
bergyn
room
farther
down
the
hall
one
by
one
lloyd
heard
the
others
go
downstairs
the
rooms
and
hallways
on
the
second
floor
fell
quiet
a
faint
subdued
murmur
of
talk
came
to
her
ears
in
the
direction
of
the
lloyd
waited
for
five
for
ten
for
fifteen
minutes
then
she
rose
drawing
in
her
breath
straightening
herself
to
her
full
height
she
went
to
the
door
then
paused
for
a
moment
looking
back
at
all
the
familiar
objects
the
plain
rich
furniture
the
the
great
comfortable
couch
the
round
mirror
that
hung
between
the
windows
and
her
of
blackened
mahogany
it
seemed
to
her
that
in
some
way
she
was
never
to
see
these
things
again
as
if
she
were
saying
to
them
and
to
the
life
she
had
led
in
that
room
and
in
their
surroundings
she
would
be
a
different
woman
when
she
came
back
to
that
room
slowly
she
descended
the
stairs
and
halted
for
a
moment
in
the
hall
below
it
was
not
too
late
to
turn
back
even
now
she
could
hear
her
companions
at
their
supper
very
plainly
and
could
distinguish
esther
thielman
laugh
as
she
exclaimed
why
of
course
that
the
very
thing
i
mean
it
was
a
strange
surprise
that
lloyd
had
in
store
for
them
all
her
heart
began
to
beat
heavy
and
thick
could
she
even
find
her
voice
to
speak
when
the
time
came
would
it
not
be
better
to
put
it
off
to
think
over
the
whole
matter
again
between
now
and
morning
but
she
moved
her
head
impatiently
no
she
would
not
turn
back
she
found
that
the
sliding
doors
in
the
had
been
closed
and
so
went
to
the
door
that
opened
into
the
from
the
hall
itself
it
stood
ajar
lloyd
pushed
it
open
entered
and
closing
the
door
behind
her
stood
there
leaning
against
it
the
table
was
almost
full
only
two
or
three
places
besides
her
own
were
unoccupied
there
was
miss
bergyn
at
the
head
the
fever
nurse
miss
douglass
at
her
right
and
lower
down
lloyd
saw
esther
thielman
delia
craig
just
back
from
a
surgical
case
of
street
miss
page
the
oldest
and
most
experienced
nurse
of
them
all
gilbertson
whom
every
one
called
by
her
last
name
miss
ives
and
eleanor
bogart
who
had
both
taken
doctors
degrees
and
could
have
practised
if
they
had
desired
miss
wentworth
who
had
served
an
apprenticeship
in
a
missionary
hospital
in
armenia
and
had
known
clara
barton
and
last
of
all
the
newcomer
miss
truslow
very
young
and
very
pretty
who
had
never
yet
had
a
case
and
upon
whose
diploma
the
ink
was
hardly
dry
at
first
so
quietly
had
she
entered
no
one
took
any
notice
of
lloyd
and
she
stood
a
moment
her
back
to
the
door
wondering
how
she
should
begin
everybody
seemed
to
be
in
the
best
of
humour
a
babel
of
talk
was
in
the
air
conversations
were
going
forward
carried
on
across
the
table
or
over
intervening
shoulders
why
of
course
do
you
see
that
the
very
thing
i
meant
i
think
you
can
get
that
already
sized
though
and
with
a
stencil
figure
if
you
want
it
really
it
very
interesting
the
first
part
is
stupid
but
she
has
some
very
good
ideas
yes
at
vanoni
but
we
get
a
reduction
you
know
and
oh
listen
this
is
too
funny
she
turned
around
and
said
very
prim
and
stiff
indeed
i
too
old
a
woman
funny
if
i
think
of
that
on
my
deathbed
i
shall
laugh
and
so
that
settled
it
how
could
i
go
on
after
that
must
you
tack
it
on
the
walls
are
so
hard
let
rownie
do
it
she
knows
oh
here
the
invalid
oh
why
it
lloyd
we
so
glad
you
able
to
come
down
but
when
they
had
done
exclaiming
over
her
reappearance
among
them
lloyd
still
remained
as
she
was
her
back
against
the
door
standing
very
straight
her
hands
at
her
side
she
did
not
immediately
reply
heads
were
turned
in
her
direction
the
talk
fell
away
by
rapid
degrees
as
they
began
to
notice
the
paleness
of
her
face
and
the
strange
firm
set
of
her
mouth
sit
down
lloyd
said
miss
bergyn
do
stand
you
are
not
very
well
yet
i
have
rownie
bring
you
a
glass
of
sherry
there
was
a
silence
then
at
length
no
said
lloyd
quietly
i
do
want
any
sherry
i
do
want
any
supper
i
came
down
to
tell
you
that
you
are
all
wrong
in
thinking
i
did
what
i
could
with
my
typhoid
case
at
medford
you
think
i
left
only
after
the
patient
had
died
i
did
not
i
left
before
there
was
a
crisis
of
some
kind
i
do
know
what
it
was
because
i
was
not
in
the
at
the
time
and
i
did
not
go
when
i
was
called
the
doctor
was
not
there
either
he
had
gone
out
and
left
the
case
in
my
charge
there
was
nobody
with
the
patient
but
a
servant
the
servant
called
me
but
i
did
not
go
instead
i
came
away
and
left
the
house
the
patient
died
that
same
day
it
is
that
that
i
wanted
to
tell
you
do
you
all
understand
perfectly
i
left
my
patient
at
the
moment
of
a
crisis
and
with
no
one
with
him
but
a
servant
and
he
died
that
same
afternoon
then
she
went
out
and
the
closing
of
the
door
jarred
sharply
upon
the
great
silence
that
had
spread
throughout
the
room
lloyd
went
back
to
her
room
closed
and
locked
the
door
and
sinking
down
upon
the
floor
by
the
couch
bowed
her
head
upon
her
folded
arms
but
she
was
in
no
mood
for
weeping
and
her
eyes
were
dry
she
was
conscious
chiefly
that
she
had
taken
an
irrevocable
step
that
her
head
had
begun
to
ache
there
was
no
exhilaration
in
her
mind
now
she
did
not
feel
any
of
the
satisfaction
of
attainment
after
struggle
of
triumph
after
victory
more
than
once
she
even
questioned
herself
if
after
all
her
confession
had
been
necessary
but
now
she
was
weary
unto
death
of
the
whole
wretched
business
now
she
only
knew
that
her
head
was
aching
fiercely
she
did
not
care
either
to
look
into
the
past
or
forward
into
the
future
the
present
occupied
her
for
the
present
her
head
was
aching
but
before
lloyd
went
to
bed
that
night
miss
bergyn
knew
the
whole
truth
as
to
what
had
happened
at
pitts
house
the
superintendent
nurse
had
followed
lloyd
to
her
room
almost
immediately
and
would
not
be
denied
she
knew
very
well
that
lloyd
searight
had
never
left
a
dying
patient
of
her
own
volition
intuitively
she
guessed
at
something
hidden
lloyd
she
said
decisively
do
ask
me
to
believe
that
you
went
of
your
own
free
will
tell
me
just
what
happened
why
did
you
go
ask
me
to
believe
anything
but
that
you
no
i
wo
say
the
word
there
was
some
very
good
reason
was
there
i
i
can
not
explain
lloyd
answered
you
must
think
what
you
choose
you
would
understand
but
happily
when
lloyd
reticence
finally
broke
miss
bergyn
did
understand
the
superintendent
nurse
knew
bennett
only
by
report
but
lloyd
she
had
known
for
years
and
realised
that
if
she
had
yielded
it
had
only
been
after
the
last
hope
had
been
tried
in
the
end
lloyd
told
her
everything
that
had
occurred
but
though
she
even
admitted
bennett
affection
for
her
she
said
nothing
about
herself
and
miss
bergyn
did
not
ask
i
know
of
course
said
the
superintendent
nurse
at
length
you
hate
to
think
that
you
were
made
to
go
but
men
are
stronger
than
women
lloyd
and
such
a
man
as
that
must
be
stronger
than
most
men
you
were
not
to
blame
because
you
left
the
case
and
you
are
certainly
not
to
blame
for
ferriss
death
now
i
shall
give
it
out
here
in
the
house
that
you
had
a
very
good
reason
for
leaving
your
case
and
that
while
we
ca
explain
it
any
more
particularly
i
have
had
a
talk
with
you
and
know
all
about
it
and
am
perfectly
satisfied
then
i
shall
go
out
to
medford
and
see
pitts
it
would
be
best
she
added
for
lloyd
had
made
a
gesture
of
feeble
dissent
he
must
understand
perfectly
and
we
need
not
be
afraid
of
any
talk
about
the
matter
at
all
what
has
happened
has
happened
the
profession
and
i
do
believe
it
will
go
any
further
lloyd
returned
to
bannister
toward
the
end
of
the
week
how
long
she
would
remain
she
did
not
know
but
for
the
present
the
association
of
the
other
nurses
was
more
than
she
was
able
to
bear
later
when
the
affair
had
become
something
of
an
old
story
she
would
return
resuming
her
work
as
though
nothing
had
happened
hattie
met
her
at
the
railway
station
with
the
phaeton
and
the
ponies
she
was
radiant
with
delight
at
the
prospect
of
having
lloyd
all
to
herself
for
an
indefinite
period
of
time
and
you
did
get
sick
after
all
she
exclaimed
clasping
her
hands
was
your
patient
as
sick
as
i
was
were
his
parents
glad
that
you
made
him
well
again
lloyd
put
her
hand
over
the
little
girl
mouth
let
us
not
talk
any
hattie
she
said
trying
to
smile
but
on
the
morning
after
her
arrival
lloyd
woke
in
her
own
white
room
of
the
old
farmhouse
abruptly
conscious
of
some
subtle
change
that
had
occurred
to
her
overnight
for
the
first
time
since
the
scene
in
the
at
medford
she
was
aware
of
a
certain
calmness
that
had
come
to
her
perhaps
she
had
at
last
begun
to
feel
the
good
effects
of
the
trial
by
fire
which
she
had
voluntarily
undergone
to
know
a
certain
happiness
that
now
there
was
no
longer
any
deceit
in
her
heart
this
she
had
uprooted
and
driven
out
by
force
of
her
own
will
it
was
gone
but
now
on
this
morning
she
seemed
to
feel
that
this
was
not
all
something
else
had
left
her
something
that
of
late
had
harassed
her
and
goaded
her
and
embittered
her
life
and
mocked
at
her
gentleness
and
kindness
was
gone
that
fierce
truculent
hatred
that
she
had
so
striven
to
put
from
her
now
behold
of
its
own
accord
it
had
seemed
to
leave
her
how
had
it
happened
before
she
had
dared
the
ordeal
of
confession
this
feeling
of
hatred
this
perverse
and
ugly
changeling
that
had
brooded
in
her
heart
had
seemed
too
strong
too
deeply
seated
to
be
moved
now
suddenly
it
had
departed
unbidden
without
effort
on
her
part
vaguely
lloyd
wondered
at
this
thing
in
driving
deceit
from
her
it
would
appear
that
she
had
also
driven
out
hatred
that
the
one
could
not
stay
so
soon
as
the
other
had
departed
could
the
one
exist
apart
from
the
other
was
there
then
some
strange
affinity
in
all
evil
as
perhaps
in
all
good
so
that
a
victory
over
one
bad
impulse
meant
a
victory
over
many
without
thought
of
gain
or
of
reward
she
had
held
to
what
was
right
through
the
confusion
and
storm
and
darkness
was
this
to
be
after
all
her
reward
her
gain
possibly
but
she
could
not
tell
she
could
not
see
the
confusion
was
subsiding
the
storm
had
passed
but
much
of
the
darkness
yet
remained
deceit
she
had
fought
from
out
her
heart
silently
hatred
had
stolen
after
it
love
had
not
returned
to
his
old
place
and
never
never
would
but
the
changeling
was
gone
and
the
house
was
swept
and
garnished
viii
the
day
after
the
funeral
bennett
returned
alone
to
pitts
house
at
medford
and
the
same
evening
his
trunks
and
baggage
containing
his
papers
the
records
observations
journals
and
of
the
expedition
followed
him
as
bennett
entered
the
gate
of
the
place
that
he
had
chosen
to
be
his
home
for
the
next
year
he
was
aware
that
the
windows
of
one
of
the
front
rooms
upon
the
second
floor
were
wide
open
the
curtains
tied
up
into
loose
knots
inside
a
servant
came
and
went
putting
the
room
to
rights
again
airing
it
and
changing
the
furniture
in
the
road
before
the
house
he
had
seen
the
marks
of
the
wheels
of
the
undertaker
wagon
where
it
had
been
backed
up
to
the
as
he
closed
the
front
door
behind
him
and
stood
for
a
moment
in
the
hallway
his
valise
in
his
hand
he
saw
hanging
upon
one
of
the
pegs
of
the
the
hat
ferriss
had
last
worn
bennett
put
down
his
valise
quickly
and
steadying
himself
against
the
wall
leaned
heavily
against
it
drawing
a
deep
breath
his
eyes
closing
the
house
was
empty
and
but
for
the
occasional
subdued
noises
that
came
from
the
front
room
at
the
end
of
the
hall
silent
bennett
picked
up
his
valise
again
and
went
upstairs
to
the
rooms
that
had
been
set
apart
for
him
he
did
not
hang
his
hat
upon
the
but
carried
it
with
him
the
housekeeper
who
met
him
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
and
showed
him
the
way
to
his
apartments
inquired
of
him
as
to
the
hours
he
wished
to
have
his
meals
served
bennett
told
her
and
then
added
i
will
have
all
my
meals
in
the
the
one
you
call
the
i
believe
and
as
soon
as
the
front
room
is
ready
i
shall
sleep
there
that
will
be
my
room
after
this
the
housekeeper
stared
it
wo
be
quite
safe
sir
for
some
time
the
doctor
gave
very
strict
orders
about
ventilating
it
and
changing
the
furniture
bennett
merely
nodded
as
if
to
say
he
understood
and
the
housekeeper
soon
after
left
him
to
himself
the
afternoon
passed
then
the
evening
such
supper
as
bennett
could
eat
was
served
according
to
his
orders
in
the
afterward
he
called
kamiska
and
went
for
a
long
walk
over
the
country
roads
in
a
direction
away
from
the
town
proceeding
slowly
his
hands
clasped
behind
his
back
later
toward
ten
he
returned
he
went
upstairs
toward
his
room
with
the
idea
of
looking
over
and
arranging
his
papers
before
going
to
bed
sleep
he
could
not
he
foresaw
that
clearly
but
bennett
was
not
yet
familiar
with
the
arrangement
of
the
house
his
mind
was
busy
with
other
things
he
was
thoughtful
abstracted
and
upon
reaching
the
stair
landing
on
the
second
floor
turned
toward
the
front
of
the
house
when
he
should
have
turned
toward
the
rear
he
entered
what
he
supposed
to
be
his
room
lit
the
gas
then
stared
about
him
in
some
perplexity
the
room
he
was
in
was
almost
bare
of
furniture
even
part
of
the
carpet
had
been
taken
up
the
windows
were
wide
open
a
stale
odour
of
drugs
pervaded
the
air
while
upon
the
bed
nothing
remained
but
the
mattress
and
bolster
for
a
moment
bennett
looked
about
him
bewildered
then
he
started
sharply
this
was
had
been
the
here
upon
that
bed
ferriss
had
died
here
had
been
enacted
one
scene
in
the
terrible
drama
wherein
he
bennett
had
played
so
conspicuous
a
part
as
bennett
stood
there
looking
about
him
one
hand
upon
the
of
the
bed
a
strange
formless
oppression
of
the
spirit
weighed
heavily
upon
him
he
seemed
to
see
upon
that
naked
bed
the
wasted
body
of
the
dearest
friend
he
had
ever
known
it
was
as
though
ferriss
were
lying
in
state
there
with
black
draperies
hung
about
the
bier
and
candles
burning
at
the
head
and
foot
death
had
been
in
that
room
empty
though
it
was
a
certain
religious
solemnity
almost
a
certain
awe
seemed
to
bear
down
upon
the
senses
before
he
knew
it
bennett
found
himself
kneeling
at
the
denuded
bed
his
face
buried
his
arms
flung
wide
across
the
place
where
ferriss
had
last
reposed
he
could
not
say
how
long
he
remained
thus
perhaps
ten
minutes
perhaps
an
hour
he
seemed
to
come
to
himself
once
more
when
he
stepped
out
into
the
hall
again
closing
and
locking
the
door
of
the
behind
him
but
now
all
thought
of
work
had
left
him
in
the
morning
he
would
arrange
his
papers
it
was
out
of
the
question
to
think
of
sleep
he
descended
once
more
to
the
lower
floor
of
the
silent
house
and
stepped
out
again
into
the
open
air
on
the
veranda
close
beside
him
was
a
wicker
bennett
sank
down
into
it
drawing
his
hands
wearily
across
his
forehead
the
stillness
of
a
summer
night
had
settled
broadly
over
the
vast
dim
landscape
there
was
no
moon
all
the
stars
were
out
very
far
off
a
whippoorwill
was
calling
incessantly
once
or
twice
from
the
little
orchard
close
at
hand
an
apple
dropped
with
a
faint
rustle
of
leaves
and
a
muffled
velvety
impact
upon
the
turf
kamiska
wide
awake
sat
motionless
upon
her
haunches
on
the
steps
looking
off
into
the
night
cocking
an
ear
to
every
faintest
sound
well
ferriss
was
dead
and
he
bennett
was
responsible
his
friend
the
man
whom
most
he
loved
was
dead
the
splendid
fight
he
had
made
for
his
life
during
that
ferocious
struggle
with
the
ice
had
been
all
of
no
effect
without
a
murmur
without
one
complaint
he
had
borne
starvation
the
bitter
arctic
cold
privation
beyond
words
the
torture
of
the
frost
that
had
gnawed
away
his
hands
the
blinding
fury
of
the
snow
and
wind
the
unceasing
and
incredible
toil
with
sledge
and
pack
all
the
terrible
hardship
of
an
unsuccessful
attempt
to
reach
the
pole
only
to
die
miserably
in
his
bed
alone
abandoned
by
the
man
and
woman
whom
of
all
people
of
the
world
he
had
most
loved
and
trusted
and
he
bennett
had
been
to
blame
was
ferriss
conscious
during
that
last
moment
did
he
know
would
he
sometime
somewhere
know
it
could
not
be
said
forever
that
must
remain
a
mystery
and
after
all
had
bennett
done
right
in
keeping
lloyd
from
the
now
that
all
was
over
now
that
the
whole
fearful
tragedy
could
be
judged
somewhat
calmly
and
in
the
light
of
reason
the
little
stealthy
doubt
began
to
insinuate
itself
at
first
he
had
turned
from
it
raging
and
furious
stamping
upon
it
as
upon
an
intruding
reptile
the
man
with
his
arrogant
and
vast
his
blind
unshaken
belief
in
the
wisdom
of
his
own
decisions
had
never
in
his
life
before
been
willing
to
admit
that
he
could
be
mistaken
that
it
was
possible
for
him
to
resolve
upon
a
false
line
of
action
he
had
always
been
right
but
now
a
change
had
come
a
woman
had
entangled
herself
in
the
workings
of
his
world
the
world
that
hitherto
had
been
only
a
world
of
men
for
him
and
now
he
faltered
now
he
questioned
himself
now
he
scrutinised
his
motives
now
the
simple
became
complicated
the
straight
crooked
right
mingled
with
wrong
bitter
with
sweet
falseness
with
truth
he
who
had
faith
in
himself
to
remove
mountains
he
who
could
drive
his
as
a
herder
drives
his
sheep
he
who
had
forced
the
vast
grip
of
the
ice
had
with
a
battering
ram
force
crushed
his
way
through
those
terrible
walls
shattered
and
breached
and
broken
down
the
barriers
now
in
this
situation
involving
a
woman
had
he
failed
had
he
weakened
and
bigger
stronger
and
more
persistently
doubt
intruded
itself
into
his
mind
hitherto
bennett
only
salvation
from
absolute
despair
had
been
the
firm
consciousness
of
his
own
rectitude
in
that
lay
his
only
comfort
his
only
hope
his
one
fabric
of
defence
if
that
was
undermined
if
that
was
eaten
away
what
was
there
left
for
him
carefully
painfully
and
with
such
minuteness
as
he
could
command
he
went
over
the
whole
affair
from
beginning
to
end
forcing
his
unwilling
mind
so
unaccustomed
to
such
work
to
weigh
each
chance
to
gauge
each
opportunity
if
were
so
if
had
been
done
then
would
results
have
followed
suppose
he
had
not
interfered
suppose
he
had
stood
aside
would
lloyd
have
run
such
danger
after
all
and
would
ferriss
at
this
time
have
been
alive
and
perhaps
recovering
had
he
bennett
been
absolutely
mad
had
he
been
blind
and
deaf
to
reason
had
he
acted
the
part
of
a
brute
a
purblind
stupid
and
unutterably
selfish
brute
thinking
chiefly
of
himself
after
all
crushing
the
woman
who
was
so
dear
to
him
sacrificing
the
life
of
the
man
he
loved
blundering
in
there
besotted
and
ignorant
acting
the
bully
part
unnecessarily
frightened
cowardly
where
he
imagined
himself
brave
weak
contemptibly
weak
where
he
imagined
himself
strong
might
it
not
have
been
avoided
if
he
had
been
even
merely
reasonable
as
in
like
case
an
ordinary
man
would
have
been
he
who
prided
himself
upon
the
promptness
and
soundness
of
his
judgment
in
great
crises
had
lost
his
head
and
all
power
of
in
this
greatest
crisis
of
all
the
doubt
came
back
to
him
again
and
again
trample
it
stifle
it
dash
it
from
him
as
he
would
each
time
it
returned
a
little
stronger
a
little
larger
a
little
more
insistent
perhaps
after
all
he
had
made
a
mistake
perhaps
after
all
lloyd
ran
no
great
danger
perhaps
after
all
ferriss
might
now
have
been
alive
all
at
once
bennett
seemed
to
be
sure
of
this
then
it
became
terrible
alone
there
in
the
darkness
and
in
the
night
bennett
went
down
into
the
pit
abruptly
he
seemed
to
come
to
himself
to
realise
what
he
had
done
as
if
rousing
from
a
nightmare
remorse
horror
the
anguish
of
bereavement
the
infinite
regret
of
things
that
never
were
to
be
again
the
bitterness
of
a
vanished
love
too
abject
for
expression
the
grief
of
the
dreadful
one
by
one
he
knew
them
all
one
by
one
like
the
slow
accumulation
of
gigantic
burdens
the
consequences
of
his
folly
descended
upon
him
heavier
more
intolerably
more
inexorably
fixed
with
every
succeeding
moment
while
the
light
of
truth
and
reason
searched
every
corner
of
his
mind
and
his
doubt
grew
and
hardened
into
certainty
if
only
bennett
could
have
believed
that
in
spite
of
what
had
happened
lloyd
yet
loved
him
he
could
have
found
some
ray
of
light
in
the
darkness
wherein
he
groped
some
saving
strength
to
bear
the
weight
of
his
remorse
and
sorrow
but
now
just
in
proportion
as
he
saw
clearer
and
truer
he
saw
that
he
must
look
for
no
help
in
that
direction
being
what
lloyd
was
it
was
impossible
for
her
even
though
she
wished
it
to
love
him
now
love
the
man
who
had
broken
her
the
thought
was
preposterous
he
remembered
clearly
that
she
had
warned
him
of
just
this
no
that
too
the
one
sweetness
of
his
rugged
life
he
must
put
from
him
as
well
had
already
and
of
his
own
accord
put
from
him
how
go
on
of
what
use
now
was
ambition
endeavour
and
the
striving
to
attain
great
ends
the
thread
of
his
life
was
snapped
his
friend
was
dead
and
the
love
of
the
one
woman
of
his
world
for
both
he
was
to
blame
of
what
avail
was
it
now
to
continue
his
work
ferriss
was
dead
who
now
would
stand
at
his
side
when
the
darkness
thickened
on
ahead
and
obstacles
drew
across
the
path
and
death
overhead
hung
poised
and
menacing
lloyd
love
for
him
was
dead
who
now
to
bid
him
godspeed
as
his
vessel
prow
swung
northward
and
the
water
whitened
in
her
wake
who
now
to
wait
behind
when
the
great
fight
was
dared
again
to
wait
behind
and
watch
for
his
and
when
the
mighty
hope
had
been
achieved
the
goal
of
all
the
centuries
attained
who
now
to
send
that
first
and
dearest
welcome
out
to
him
when
the
returning
ship
showed
over
the
horizon
rim
flagged
from
her
decks
to
her
crosstrees
in
all
the
royal
blazonry
of
an
immortal
triumph
now
that
triumph
was
never
to
be
for
him
ambition
too
was
dead
some
other
was
to
win
where
now
he
could
but
lose
to
gain
where
now
he
could
but
fail
some
other
stronger
than
he
more
resolute
more
determined
at
last
bennett
had
come
to
this
he
who
once
had
been
so
imperial
in
the
consciousness
of
his
power
so
arrogant
so
uncompromising
beaten
beaten
at
last
defeated
daunted
driven
from
his
highest
hopes
abandoning
his
dearest
ambitions
and
how
and
why
not
by
the
enemy
he
had
so
often
faced
and
dared
not
by
any
power
external
to
himself
but
by
his
very
self
self
crushed
by
the
engine
he
himself
had
set
in
motion
shattered
by
the
recoil
of
the
very
force
that
for
so
long
had
dwelt
within
himself
nothing
in
all
the
world
could
have
broken
him
but
that
danger
however
great
could
not
have
cowed
him
circumstances
however
hopeless
could
not
have
made
him
despair
obstacles
however
vast
could
not
have
turned
him
back
himself
was
the
only
enemy
that
could
have
conquered
his
own
power
the
only
one
to
which
he
would
have
yielded
and
fate
had
so
ordered
it
that
this
one
enemy
of
all
others
this
one
power
of
all
others
had
turned
upon
and
rent
him
the
mystery
of
it
the
terror
of
it
why
had
he
never
known
how
was
it
he
had
never
guessed
what
was
this
ruthless
monster
this
other
self
that
for
so
long
had
slept
within
his
flesh
strong
with
his
better
strength
feeding
and
growing
big
with
that
he
fancied
was
the
best
in
him
that
tricked
him
with
his
noblest
emotion
the
love
of
a
good
woman
lured
him
to
a
moment
of
weakness
then
suddenly
and
without
warning
leaped
at
his
throat
and
struck
him
to
the
ground
he
had
committed
one
of
those
offences
which
the
law
does
not
reach
but
whose
punishment
is
greater
than
any
law
can
inflict
retribution
had
been
fearfully
swift
his
career
ferriss
and
lloyd
ambition
friendship
and
the
love
of
a
woman
had
been
a
trinity
of
dominant
impulses
in
his
life
abruptly
almost
in
a
single
instant
he
had
lost
them
all
had
thrown
them
away
he
could
never
get
them
back
bennett
started
sharply
what
was
this
on
his
cheek
what
was
this
that
suddenly
dimmed
his
eyes
had
it
actually
come
to
this
and
this
was
he
bennett
the
same
man
who
had
commanded
the
freja
expedition
no
it
was
not
the
same
man
that
man
was
dead
he
ground
his
teeth
shaken
with
the
violence
of
emotions
that
seemed
to
be
tearing
his
heart
to
pieces
lost
lost
to
him
forever
bennett
bowed
his
head
upon
his
folded
arms
through
his
clenched
teeth
his
words
seemed
almost
wrenched
from
him
each
word
an
agony
dick
dick
old
man
you
gone
gone
from
me
and
it
was
i
who
did
it
and
lloyd
she
too
she
god
help
me
then
the
tension
snapped
the
great
massive
frame
shook
with
grief
from
head
to
heel
and
the
harsh
angular
face
with
its
salient
jaw
and
hard
uncouth
lines
was
wet
with
the
first
tears
he
had
ever
known
he
was
roused
at
length
by
a
sudden
movement
on
the
part
of
the
dog
kamiska
had
risen
to
her
feet
with
a
low
growl
then
as
the
clinked
she
threw
up
her
head
and
gave
tongue
to
the
night
with
all
the
force
of
her
lungs
bennett
straightened
up
thanking
fortune
that
the
night
was
dark
and
looked
about
him
a
figure
was
coming
up
the
front
walk
the
gravel
crunching
under
foot
it
was
the
figure
of
a
man
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
of
the
veranda
he
paused
and
as
bennett
made
a
movement
turned
in
his
direction
and
said
is
this
pitts
house
bennett
reply
was
drowned
in
the
clamour
of
the
dog
but
the
other
seemed
to
understand
for
he
answered
i
looking
for
ferriss
richard
ferriss
of
the
freja
they
told
me
he
was
brought
here
kamiska
stopped
her
barking
sniffed
once
or
twice
at
the
man
trouser
legs
then
in
brusque
frenzy
of
delight
leaped
against
him
licking
his
hands
dancing
about
him
on
two
legs
whining
and
yelping
bennett
came
forward
and
the
man
changed
his
position
so
that
the
light
from
the
front
door
shone
upon
his
face
why
adler
exclaimed
bennett
well
where
did
you
come
from
mr
bennett
almost
shouted
the
other
snatching
off
his
cap
it
ai
really
you
sir
his
face
beamed
and
radiated
a
joy
little
short
of
beatitude
the
man
was
actually
trembling
with
happiness
words
failed
him
and
as
with
a
certain
clumsy
tenderness
he
clasped
hand
in
both
his
own
his
chief
saw
the
tears
in
his
eyes
oh
maybe
i
ai
glad
to
see
you
sir
i
thought
you
had
gone
away
i
did
know
where
i
i
did
know
as
i
was
ever
going
to
see
you
again
kamiska
herself
had
been
no
less
tremulously
glad
to
see
adler
than
was
adler
to
see
bennett
he
stammered
he
confused
himself
he
shifted
his
weight
from
one
foot
to
the
other
his
eyes
danced
he
laughed
and
choked
he
dropped
his
cap
his
joy
was
that
of
a
child
unrestrained
unaffected
as
genuine
as
gold
when
they
turned
back
to
the
veranda
he
eagerly
drew
up
bennett
chair
for
him
his
eyes
never
leaving
his
face
it
was
the
quivering
inarticulate
affection
of
a
dog
for
its
master
faithful
submissive
unquestioning
happy
for
hours
over
a
chance
look
a
kind
word
a
touch
of
the
hand
to
adler
mind
it
would
have
been
a
privilege
and
an
honour
to
have
died
for
bennett
why
he
was
his
chief
his
king
his
god
his
master
who
could
do
no
wrong
bennett
could
have
slain
him
where
he
stood
and
adler
would
still
have
trusted
him
adler
would
not
sit
down
until
bennett
had
twice
ordered
him
to
do
so
and
then
he
deposited
himself
in
a
nearby
chair
in
as
uncomfortable
a
position
as
he
could
devise
allowing
only
the
smallest
fraction
of
his
body
to
be
supported
as
a
mark
of
deference
he
remained
uncovered
and
from
time
to
time
nervously
saluted
but
suddenly
he
remembered
the
object
of
his
visit
oh
but
i
forgot
seeing
you
like
this
unexpected
sir
clean
drove
ferriss
out
of
my
mind
how
is
he
getting
on
i
saw
in
the
papers
he
was
main
sick
he
dead
said
bennett
quietly
adler
was
for
the
moment
stricken
speechless
his
jaw
dropped
he
stared
and
caught
his
breath
ferriss
dead
he
exclaimed
at
length
i
i
ca
believe
it
he
crossed
himself
rapidly
bennett
made
no
reply
and
for
upward
of
five
minutes
the
two
men
sat
motionless
in
the
chairs
looking
off
into
the
night
after
a
while
adler
broke
silence
and
asked
a
few
questions
as
to
ferriss
sickness
and
the
nature
and
time
of
his
death
questions
which
bennett
answered
as
best
he
might
but
it
was
evident
that
bennett
alive
and
present
there
in
the
flesh
was
more
to
adler
than
ferriss
dead
but
all
right
sir
ai
you
he
asked
at
length
there
ai
anything
the
matter
with
you
no
said
bennett
looking
at
him
steadily
then
suddenly
he
added
adler
i
was
to
blame
for
ferriss
death
if
it
had
been
for
me
he
would
probably
have
been
alive
it
was
my
fault
i
did
what
i
thought
was
right
when
i
knew
all
the
time
just
as
i
know
now
that
i
was
wrong
so
when
any
one
asks
you
about
ferriss
death
you
are
to
tell
him
just
what
you
know
about
it
understand
through
a
mistake
i
was
responsible
for
his
death
i
shall
not
tell
you
more
than
that
but
that
much
you
ought
to
know
adler
looked
at
bennett
curiously
and
with
infinite
amazement
the
order
of
his
universe
was
breaking
up
about
his
ears
bennett
the
inscrutable
who
performed
his
wonders
in
a
mystery
impenetrable
to
common
eyes
who
moved
with
his
head
in
the
clouds
behold
he
was
rendering
account
to
him
adler
the
meanest
of
his
subjects
the
king
was
condescending
to
the
vassal
was
admitting
him
to
his
confidence
and
what
was
this
thing
he
was
saying
that
he
was
responsible
for
ferriss
death
adler
did
not
understand
his
wits
could
not
adjust
themselves
to
such
information
ferriss
was
dead
but
how
was
bennett
to
blame
the
king
could
do
no
wrong
adler
did
not
understand
no
doubt
bennett
was
referring
to
something
that
had
happened
during
the
retreat
over
the
ice
something
that
had
to
be
done
and
that
in
the
end
and
after
all
this
lapse
of
time
had
brought
about
ferriss
death
in
any
case
bennett
had
done
what
was
right
for
that
matter
he
had
been
responsible
for
mcpherson
death
but
what
else
had
there
been
to
do
bennett
had
spoken
as
he
did
after
a
moment
rapid
thinking
to
questions
as
to
the
manner
of
the
chief
engineer
death
bennett
had
at
first
given
evasive
replies
but
a
sudden
sense
of
shame
at
being
compelled
to
dissemble
before
a
subordinate
had
lashed
him
across
the
face
true
he
had
made
a
mistake
a
fearful
unspeakable
mistake
but
at
least
let
him
be
man
enough
to
face
and
to
accept
its
consequences
it
might
not
be
necessary
or
even
expedient
to
make
acknowledgment
of
his
folly
in
all
quarters
but
at
that
moment
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
men
at
least
one
of
them
who
had
been
under
the
command
of
himself
and
his
friend
had
a
right
to
be
told
the
truth
it
had
been
only
one
degree
less
distasteful
to
undeceive
adler
than
it
had
been
to
deceive
him
in
the
first
place
bennett
was
not
the
general
to
explain
his
actions
to
his
men
but
he
had
not
hesitated
a
moment
however
adler
was
full
of
another
subject
and
soon
broke
out
with
you
know
sir
there
another
expedition
forming
i
suppose
you
have
heard
an
english
one
they
call
it
the
expedition
they
are
going
to
try
the
old
route
by
smith
sound
they
are
going
to
winter
at
tasiusak
and
try
to
get
through
the
sound
as
soon
as
the
ice
breaks
up
in
the
spring
but
duane
ideas
are
all
wrong
he
make
no
very
high
northing
not
above
i
bet
a
hat
when
we
go
up
again
sir
will
you
will
you
let
me
will
you
take
me
along
did
i
give
satisfaction
this
last
i
never
going
up
again
adler
answered
bennett
sho
said
adler
a
little
blankly
i
thought
sure
i
never
thought
that
you
why
there
ai
no
one
else
but
you
do
it
captain
oh
yes
there
is
said
bennett
listlessly
duane
can
if
he
has
luck
i
know
him
he
a
good
man
no
i
out
of
it
adler
i
had
my
chance
it
is
somebody
else
turn
now
do
you
want
to
go
with
duane
i
can
give
you
letters
to
him
he
be
glad
to
have
you
i
know
adler
started
from
his
place
why
do
you
think
he
exclaimed
vehemently
do
you
think
i
go
with
anybody
else
but
you
sir
oh
you
will
be
going
some
of
these
days
sure
of
it
we
we
have
another
try
at
it
sir
before
we
die
we
ai
beaten
yet
yes
we
are
adler
returned
bennett
smiling
calmly
we
stay
at
home
now
and
write
our
book
but
we
let
some
one
else
reach
the
pole
that
not
for
us
never
will
be
adler
at
the
end
of
their
talk
some
later
adler
stood
up
remarking
guess
i
better
be
standing
by
if
i
to
get
the
last
train
back
to
the
city
they
told
me
at
the
station
that
she
clear
about
midnight
suddenly
he
began
to
show
signs
of
uneasiness
turning
his
cap
about
between
his
fingers
changing
his
weight
from
foot
to
foot
then
at
length
you
would
be
wanting
a
man
about
the
place
would
you
sir
and
before
bennett
could
reply
he
continued
eagerly
i
been
a
bit
of
most
trades
in
my
time
and
i
know
how
to
take
care
of
a
garden
like
as
you
have
here
i
a
main
good
hand
with
plants
and
flower
things
and
i
could
help
around
generally
then
earnestly
let
me
stay
sir
it
wo
cost
i
would
think
of
taking
a
cent
from
you
captain
just
let
me
act
as
your
orderly
for
a
spell
sir
i
sure
give
satisfaction
will
you
sir
will
you
nonsense
adler
returned
bennett
stay
if
you
like
i
presume
i
can
find
use
for
you
but
you
must
be
paid
of
course
not
a
soomarkee
protested
the
other
almost
indignantly
the
next
day
adler
brought
his
chest
down
from
the
city
and
took
up
his
quarters
with
bennett
at
medford
though
pitts
had
long
since
ceased
to
keep
horses
the
stable
still
adjoined
the
house
and
adler
swung
his
hammock
in
the
coachman
old
room
bennett
could
not
induce
him
to
room
in
the
house
itself
adler
prided
himself
that
he
knew
his
place
after
their
first
evening
conversation
he
never
spoke
to
bennett
until
spoken
to
first
and
the
resumed
relationship
of
commander
and
subordinate
was
inexpressibly
dear
to
him
it
was
something
to
see
adler
waiting
on
the
table
in
the
in
his
blue
jersey
standing
at
attention
at
the
door
happy
in
the
mere
sight
of
bennett
at
his
meals
in
the
mornings
as
soon
as
breakfast
was
ready
it
was
privilege
to
announce
the
fact
to
bennett
whom
he
usually
found
already
at
work
upon
his
writing
returning
thence
to
the
adler
waited
for
his
lord
to
appear
as
soon
as
he
heard
bennett
step
in
the
hall
a
little
tremor
of
excitement
possessed
him
he
ran
to
chair
drawing
it
back
for
him
and
as
soon
as
bennett
had
seated
himself
circled
about
him
with
all
the
pride
and
solicitude
of
a
motherly
hen
he
opened
his
napkin
for
him
delivered
him
his
paper
and
pushed
his
cup
of
coffee
a
nearer
his
hand
throughout
the
duration
of
the
meal
he
hardly
took
his
eyes
from
bennett
face
watching
his
every
movement
with
a
glow
of
pride
his
hands
gently
stroking
one
another
in
an
excess
of
satisfaction
and
silent
enjoyment
the
days
passed
soon
a
fortnight
was
gone
by
drearily
mechanically
bennett
had
begun
work
upon
his
book
the
narrative
of
the
expedition
it
was
repugnant
to
him
long
since
he
had
lost
all
interest
in
polar
exploration
as
he
had
said
to
adler
he
was
out
of
it
finally
and
irrevocably
his
bolt
was
shot
his
role
upon
the
stage
of
the
world
was
ended
he
only
desired
now
to
be
forgotten
as
quickly
as
possible
to
lapse
into
mediocrity
as
easily
and
quietly
as
he
could
fame
was
nothing
to
him
now
the
thundering
applause
of
an
entire
world
that
had
once
been
his
was
mere
noise
empty
and
meaningless
he
did
not
care
to
reawaken
it
the
appearance
of
his
book
he
knew
was
expected
and
waited
for
in
every
civilised
nation
of
the
globe
it
would
be
printed
in
languages
whereof
he
was
ignorant
but
it
was
all
one
with
him
now
the
task
of
writing
was
hateful
to
him
beyond
expression
but
with
such
determination
as
he
could
yet
summon
to
his
aid
bennett
stuck
to
it
eight
ten
and
sometimes
fourteen
hours
each
day
in
a
way
his
narrative
was
an
atonement
ferriss
was
its
hero
almost
instinctively
bennett
kept
the
figure
of
himself
his
own
achievements
his
own
plans
and
ideas
in
the
background
on
more
than
one
page
he
deliberately
ascribed
to
ferriss
triumphs
which
no
one
but
himself
had
attained
it
was
ferriss
who
was
the
leader
the
victor
to
whom
all
laurels
were
due
it
was
ferriss
whose
example
had
stimulated
the
expedition
to
its
best
efforts
in
the
darkest
hours
it
was
practically
ferriss
who
had
saved
the
party
after
the
destruction
of
the
ship
whose
determination
unbroken
courage
endurance
and
intelligence
had
pervaded
all
minds
and
hearts
during
the
retreat
to
kolyuchin
bay
though
nominally
in
command
wrote
bennett
i
continually
gave
place
to
him
without
his
leadership
we
should
all
unquestionably
have
perished
before
even
reaching
land
his
resolution
to
conquer
at
whatever
cost
was
an
inspiration
to
us
all
where
he
showed
the
way
we
had
to
follow
his
courage
was
never
daunted
his
hope
was
never
dimmed
his
foresight
his
intelligence
his
ingenuity
in
meeting
and
dealing
with
apparently
unsolvable
problems
were
nothing
short
of
marvellous
his
was
the
genius
of
leadership
he
was
the
explorer
born
to
his
work
one
day
just
after
luncheon
as
bennett
according
to
his
custom
was
walking
in
the
garden
by
the
house
smoking
a
cigar
before
returning
to
his
work
he
was
surprised
to
find
himself
bleeding
at
the
nose
it
was
but
a
trifling
matter
and
passed
off
in
a
few
moments
but
the
fact
of
its
occurrence
directed
his
attention
to
the
state
of
his
health
and
he
told
himself
that
for
the
last
few
days
he
had
not
been
at
all
his
accustomed
self
there
had
been
dull
pains
in
his
back
and
legs
more
than
once
his
head
had
pained
him
and
of
late
the
continuance
of
his
work
had
been
growing
steadily
more
obnoxious
to
him
the
very
physical
effort
of
driving
the
pen
from
line
to
line
was
a
burden
hum
he
said
to
himself
later
on
in
the
day
when
the
bleeding
at
the
nose
returned
upon
him
i
think
we
need
a
little
quinine
but
the
next
day
he
found
he
could
not
eat
and
all
the
afternoon
though
he
held
doggedly
to
his
work
he
was
troubled
with
nausea
at
times
a
great
weakness
a
relaxing
of
all
the
muscles
came
over
him
in
the
evening
he
sent
a
note
to
pitts
address
in
the
city
asking
him
to
come
down
to
medford
the
next
day
on
the
monday
morning
of
the
following
week
some
two
hours
after
breakfast
lloyd
met
miss
douglass
on
the
stairs
dressed
for
the
street
and
carrying
her
nurse
bag
are
you
going
out
she
asked
of
the
fever
nurse
in
some
astonishment
where
are
you
going
for
lloyd
had
returned
to
duty
and
it
was
her
name
that
now
stood
at
the
top
of
the
list
i
thought
it
was
my
turn
to
go
out
she
added
miss
douglass
was
evidently
much
confused
her
meeting
with
lloyd
had
apparently
been
unexpected
she
halted
upon
the
stairs
in
great
embarrassment
stammering
no
no
i
on
call
i
i
was
called
out
of
my
turn
specially
called
that
was
it
were
you
demanded
lloyd
sharply
for
the
other
nurse
was
disturbed
to
an
extraordinary
degree
well
then
no
i
was
but
the
superintendent
miss
bergyn
she
thought
she
advised
you
had
better
see
her
i
will
see
her
declared
lloyd
but
do
you
go
till
i
find
out
why
i
was
skipped
lloyd
hurried
at
once
to
miss
bergyn
room
indignant
at
this
slight
surely
after
what
had
happened
she
was
entitled
to
more
consideration
than
this
of
all
the
staff
in
the
house
she
should
have
been
the
one
to
be
preferred
miss
bergyn
rose
at
lloyd
sudden
entrance
into
her
room
and
to
her
question
responded
it
was
only
because
i
wanted
to
spare
you
further
trouble
and
and
embarrassment
lloyd
that
i
told
miss
douglass
to
take
your
place
this
call
is
from
medford
pitts
was
here
himself
this
morning
and
he
thought
as
i
did
thought
what
i
do
understand
it
seemed
to
me
answered
the
superintendent
nurse
that
this
one
case
of
all
others
would
be
the
hardest
the
most
disagreeable
for
you
to
take
it
seems
that
bennett
has
leased
pitts
house
from
him
he
is
there
now
at
the
time
when
ferriss
was
beginning
to
be
ill
bennett
was
with
him
a
great
deal
and
undertook
to
nurse
him
till
pitts
interfered
and
put
a
professional
nurse
on
the
case
since
then
too
the
doctor
has
found
out
that
bennett
has
exposed
himself
imprudently
at
any
rate
in
some
way
he
has
contracted
the
same
disease
and
is
rather
seriously
ill
with
it
pitts
wants
us
to
send
him
a
nurse
at
once
it
just
happened
that
it
was
your
turn
and
i
thought
i
had
better
skip
your
name
and
send
louise
douglass
lloyd
sank
into
a
chair
her
hands
falling
limply
in
her
lap
a
frown
of
perplexity
gathered
on
her
forehead
but
suddenly
she
exclaimed
i
know
that
all
as
it
may
be
but
all
the
staff
know
that
it
is
my
turn
to
go
everybody
in
the
house
knows
who
is
on
call
how
will
it
be
what
will
be
thought
when
it
is
known
that
i
have
gone
and
after
after
my
failing
once
after
this
this
other
affair
no
i
must
go
i
of
all
people
must
go
and
just
because
it
is
a
typhoid
case
like
the
other
but
lloyd
how
you
true
how
could
she
her
patient
would
be
the
same
man
who
had
humiliated
her
and
broken
her
had
so
cruelly
misunderstood
and
wronged
her
for
whom
all
her
love
was
dead
how
could
she
face
him
again
yet
how
refuse
to
take
the
case
how
explain
a
second
failure
to
her
companions
lloyd
made
a
little
movement
of
distress
clasping
her
hands
together
how
the
complications
followed
fast
upon
each
other
no
sooner
was
one
difficult
situation
met
and
disposed
of
than
another
presented
itself
bennett
was
nothing
to
her
now
yet
for
all
that
she
recoiled
instinctively
from
meeting
him
again
not
only
must
she
meet
him
but
she
must
be
with
him
day
after
day
hour
after
hour
at
his
very
side
in
all
the
intimacy
that
the
involved
on
the
other
hand
how
could
she
decline
this
case
the
staff
might
condone
one
apparent
and
inexplicable
defection
another
would
certainly
not
be
overlooked
but
was
not
this
new
situation
a
happy
and
opportunity
to
vindicate
her
impaired
prestige
in
the
eyes
of
her
companions
lloyd
made
up
her
mind
upon
the
instant
she
rose
i
shall
take
the
case
she
said
she
was
not
a
little
surprised
at
herself
hardly
an
instant
had
she
hesitated
on
that
other
occasion
when
she
had
believed
it
right
to
make
confession
to
her
associates
it
had
been
hard
at
times
almost
impossible
for
her
to
do
her
duty
as
she
saw
and
understood
it
this
new
complication
was
scarcely
less
difficult
but
once
having
attained
the
fine
moral
rigour
that
had
carried
her
through
her
former
ordeal
it
became
easy
now
to
do
right
under
all
or
any
circumstances
however
adverse
if
she
had
failed
then
she
certainly
would
have
failed
now
that
she
had
succeeded
then
made
it
all
the
easier
to
succeed
now
dimly
lloyd
commenced
to
understand
that
the
mastery
of
self
the
steady
firm
control
of
natural
intuitive
impulses
selfish
because
natural
was
a
progression
each
victory
not
only
gained
the
immediate
end
in
view
but
braced
the
mind
and
increased
the
force
of
will
for
the
next
shock
the
next
struggle
she
had
imagined
and
had
told
herself
that
bennett
had
broken
her
strength
for
good
but
was
it
really
so
had
not
defeat
in
that
case
been
only
temporary
was
she
not
slowly
getting
back
her
strength
by
an
unflinching
adherence
to
the
simple
fundamental
principles
of
right
and
duty
and
truth
was
not
the
struggle
with
one
self
the
greatest
fight
of
all
greater
far
greater
than
had
been
the
conflict
between
bennett
will
and
her
own
within
the
hour
she
found
herself
once
again
on
her
way
to
medford
how
much
had
happened
through
what
changes
had
she
passed
since
the
occasion
of
her
first
journey
and
bennett
how
he
too
changed
how
different
he
had
come
to
stand
in
her
estimation
once
the
thought
that
he
was
in
danger
had
been
a
constant
terror
to
her
and
haunted
her
days
and
lurked
at
her
side
through
many
a
waking
night
was
it
possible
that
now
his
life
or
death
was
no
more
to
her
than
that
of
any
of
her
former
patients
she
could
not
say
she
avoided
answering
the
question
certainly
her
heart
beat
no
faster
at
this
moment
to
know
that
he
was
in
the
grip
of
a
perilous
disease
she
told
herself
that
her
bennett
was
dead
already
that
she
was
coming
back
to
medford
not
to
care
for
and
watch
over
the
individual
but
to
combat
the
disease
when
she
arrived
at
the
doctor
house
in
medford
a
man
opened
the
door
for
her
and
asked
immediately
if
she
was
the
nurse
yes
said
lloyd
i
am
is
pitts
here
upstairs
in
his
room
answered
the
other
in
a
whisper
closing
the
front
door
with
infinite
softness
he
wo
let
me
go
in
the
doctor
wo
i
i
ai
seen
him
in
four
days
ask
the
doctor
if
i
ca
just
have
a
blink
at
him
just
a
little
blink
through
the
crack
of
the
door
just
think
miss
i
ai
seen
him
in
four
days
just
think
of
that
and
look
here
they
ai
giving
him
enough
to
eat
nothing
but
milk
and
chicken
soup
with
rice
in
it
he
never
did
like
rice
that
no
kind
of
rations
for
a
sick
man
i
fixed
him
up
a
bit
of
duff
yesterday
what
he
used
to
like
so
much
aboard
ship
and
pitts
would
let
him
have
it
he
regularly
laughed
in
my
face
lloyd
sent
word
to
the
doctor
by
the
housekeeper
that
she
had
arrived
and
on
going
up
found
pitts
waiting
for
her
at
the
door
of
the
not
that
which
had
been
occupied
by
ferriss
but
another
the
of
the
house
situated
toward
the
rear
of
the
building
why
i
expected
miss
douglass
exclaimed
the
doctor
in
a
low
voice
as
soon
as
his
eye
fell
upon
lloyd
any
one
of
them
but
you
i
had
to
come
lloyd
answered
quietly
flushing
hotly
for
all
that
it
was
my
turn
and
it
was
not
right
for
me
to
stay
away
the
doctor
hesitated
an
instant
and
then
dismissed
the
subject
putting
his
chin
in
the
air
as
if
to
say
that
after
all
it
was
not
his
affair
well
he
said
it
queer
to
see
how
things
will
tangle
themselves
sometimes
i
do
know
whether
he
took
this
thing
from
ferriss
or
not
both
of
them
were
exposed
to
the
same
conditions
when
their
expedition
went
to
pieces
and
they
were
taken
off
by
the
whaling
ships
bad
water
weakened
constitution
not
much
power
of
resistance
in
prime
condition
for
the
bacillus
and
the
same
cause
might
have
produced
the
same
effect
at
any
rate
he
in
a
bad
way
is
he
very
bad
asked
lloyd
well
he
not
the
sort
that
ferriss
was
nothing
undecided
about
captain
ward
bennett
when
he
sick
he
sick
rushes
right
at
it
like
a
blind
bull
he
as
bad
now
as
ferriss
was
in
his
third
week
do
you
think
he
will
recognise
me
the
doctor
shook
his
head
no
delirious
most
of
the
time
of
course
regulation
thing
if
we
do
keep
the
fever
down
he
go
out
sure
that
the
danger
in
his
case
look
at
him
yourself
here
he
is
the
devil
the
animal
is
sitting
up
again
as
lloyd
entered
the
room
she
saw
bennett
sitting
bolt
upright
in
his
bed
staring
straight
before
him
his
small
eyes
with
their
deforming
cast
open
to
their
fullest
extent
the
fingers
of
his
shrunken
bony
hands
dancing
nervously
on
the
coverlet
a
week
growth
of
stubble
blackened
the
lower
part
of
his
face
without
a
moment
pause
he
mumbled
and
muttered
with
astonishing
rapidity
but
for
the
most
part
the
words
were
undistinguishable
it
was
indeed
not
the
same
bennett
lloyd
had
last
seen
the
great
body
was
collapsed
upon
itself
the
skin
of
the
face
was
like
dry
brown
parchment
and
behind
it
the
big
massive
bones
stood
out
in
great
knobs
and
ridges
it
needed
but
a
glance
to
know
that
here
was
a
man
dangerously
near
to
his
death
while
lloyd
was
removing
her
hat
and
preparing
herself
for
her
work
the
doctor
got
bennett
upon
his
back
again
and
replenished
the
about
his
head
not
much
strength
left
in
our
friend
now
he
murmured
how
long
has
he
been
like
this
asked
lloyd
as
she
arranged
the
contents
of
her
nurse
bag
on
a
table
near
the
window
pretty
close
to
eight
hours
now
he
was
conscious
yesterday
morning
however
for
a
little
while
and
wanted
to
know
what
his
chances
were
they
were
neither
good
nor
many
the
strength
once
so
formidable
was
ebbing
away
like
a
refluent
tide
and
that
with
ominous
swiftness
stimulate
the
life
as
the
doctor
would
strive
against
the
advance
as
lloyd
might
bennett
continued
to
sink
the
devil
of
it
is
muttered
the
doctor
that
he
do
seem
to
care
he
had
as
soon
give
up
as
not
it
hard
to
save
a
patient
that
want
to
save
himself
if
he
fight
for
his
life
as
he
did
in
the
arctic
we
could
pull
him
through
yet
otherwise
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
almost
helplessly
the
next
night
toward
nine
lloyd
took
the
doctor
place
at
their
patient
bedside
and
pitts
without
taking
off
his
clothes
stretched
himself
out
upon
the
sofa
in
one
of
the
rooms
on
the
lower
floor
of
the
house
with
the
understanding
that
the
nurse
was
to
call
him
in
case
of
any
change
but
as
the
doctor
was
groping
his
way
down
the
darkened
stairway
he
stumbled
against
adler
and
kamiska
adler
was
sitting
on
one
of
the
steps
and
the
dog
was
on
her
haunches
close
at
his
side
the
two
were
huddled
together
there
in
the
dark
broad
awake
shoulder
to
shoulder
waiting
watching
and
listening
for
the
faint
sounds
that
came
at
long
intervals
from
the
direction
of
the
room
where
bennett
lay
as
the
physician
passed
him
adler
stood
up
and
saluted
is
he
doing
any
better
now
sir
he
whispered
nothing
new
returned
the
other
brusquely
he
may
get
well
in
three
weeks
time
or
he
may
die
before
midnight
so
there
you
are
you
know
as
much
about
it
as
i
do
damn
that
dog
he
trod
upon
kamiska
who
forbore
heroically
to
yelp
and
went
on
his
way
adler
resumed
his
place
on
the
stairs
sitting
down
gingerly
so
that
the
boards
should
not
creak
under
his
weight
he
took
head
between
his
hands
and
rocked
himself
gently
to
and
fro
what
are
we
going
to
do
little
dog
he
whispered
what
are
we
going
to
do
if
if
our
captain
should
if
he
should
he
had
no
words
to
finish
kamiska
took
her
place
again
by
his
side
and
the
two
resumed
their
vigil
meanwhile
not
fifty
feet
away
a
low
voice
monotonous
and
rapid
was
keeping
up
a
continuous
murmuring
flow
of
words
that
well

only
a
quarter
of
a
mile
covered
everybody
suffering
in
their
feet
and
so
weak
and
starving
and
freezing
all
at
once
the
voice
became
a
wail
my
god
is
it
never
going
to
end
sh
h
steady
what
was
that
who
whimpered

that

what

latitude
the
voice
began
to
grow
louder
come
on
men
we
most
there
he
rose
to
a
sitting
position
suddenly
the
voice
rose
to
a
shout
ninety
degrees
god
it
the
pole
the
voice
died
away
to
indistinct
mutterings
lloyd
was
at
the
bedside
by
now
and
quietly
pressed
bennett
down
upon
his
back
but
as
she
did
so
a
thrill
of
infinite
pity
and
compassion
quivered
through
her
she
had
forced
him
down
so
easily
he
was
so
pitifully
weak
woman
though
she
was
she
could
with
one
small
hand
upon
his
breast
control
this
man
who
at
one
time
had
been
of
such
colossal
strength
such
vast
physical
force
suddenly
bennett
began
again
where
ferriss
where
richard
ferriss
where
the
chief
engineer
of
the
freja
arctic
exploring
expedition
he
fell
silent
again
and
but
for
the
twitching
dancing
hands
lay
quiet
then
he
cried
attention
to
the
rapidly
and
in
a
low
voice
he
began
calling
off
the
muster
of
the
freja

and
officers

waited
for
a
moment
then
repeated
the
name
chief
engineer
richard
ferriss
again
he
was
silent
but
after
a
few
seconds
he
called
aloud
in
agony
of
anxiety
chief
engineer
richard
ferriss
answer
to
the
then
once
more

began
his
disordered

and
again
bennett
repeated
this
phrase
calling
richard
ferriss
richard
ferriss
and
immediately
adding
in
a
broken
voice
died
by
the
act
of
his
best
friend
captain
ward
bennett
or
at
times
it
was
only
the
absence
of
ferriss
that
seemed
to
torture
him
he
would
call
the
roll
answering
here
to
each
name
until
he
reached
ferriss
then
he
would
not
respond
but
instead
would
cry
aloud
over
and
over
again
in
accents
of
the
bitterest
grief
richard

answer
to
the
richard

suddenly
with
a
feeble
quavering
cry
for
sake
dick

to
the
the
hours
passed
ten
struck
then
eleven
at
midnight
lloyd
took
the
temperature
which
had
decreased
considerably
and
the
pulse
and
refilled
the
about
the
head
bennett
was
still
muttering
in
the
throes
of
delirium
still
calling
for
ferriss
imploring
him
to
answer
to
the
or
repeating
the
words
dick
ferriss
chief
engineer
died
at
the
hands
of
his
best

in
tones
so
pitiful

down
her
cheeks

lloyd
searight
what
are
you
doing
in
this
room
on
the
instant
the
voice
had
changed
from
confused
mutterings
to
distinct
words
the
transition
was
so
sudden
that
lloyd
at
the
moment
busy
at
her
nurse
bag
her
back
to
the
bed
wheeled
sharply
about
to
find
bennett
sitting
bolt
upright
looking
straight
at
her
with
intelligent
eyes
lloyd
heart
for
an
instant
stood
still
almost
in
terror
this
sudden
leap
back
from
the
darkness
of
delirium
into
the
daylight
of
consciousness
was
almost
like
a
rising
from
the
dead
appalling
she
caught
her
breath
trembling
in
spite
of
her
best
efforts
and
for
an
instant
leaned
a
hand
upon
the
table
behind
her
but
on
bennett
face
ghastly
ravaged
by
disease
with
its
vast
protruding
jaw
its
narrow
contracted
forehead
and
unkempt
growth
of
beard
the
dawning
of
intelligence
and
surprise
swiftly
gave
place
to
an
expression
of
terrible
anxiety
and
apprehension
what
are
you
doing
here
lloyd
he
cried
hush
she
answered
quickly
as
she
came
forward
above
all
things
you
must
not
sit
up
lie
down
again
and
do
talk
you
are
very
sick
i
know
i
know
he
answered
feebly
i
know
what
it
is
but
you
must
leave
here
it
a
terrible
risk
every
moment
you
stay
in
this
room
i
want
you
to
go
you
understand
at
once
call
the
doctor
do
come
near
the
bed
he
went
on
excitedly
struggling
to
keep
himself
from
sinking
back
upon
the
pillows
his
breath
was
coming
quick
his
eyes
were
flashing
all
the
poor
shattered
senses
were
aroused
and
quivering
with
excitement
and
dread
it
will
kill
you
to
stay
here
he
continued
almost
breathless
out
of
this
room
he
commanded
out
of
this
house
it
is
mine
now
i
the
master
here
do
you
understand
do
he
exclaimed
as
lloyd
put
her
hands
upon
his
shoulders
to
force
him
to
lie
down
again
do
do
touch
me
stand
away
from
me
he
tried
to
draw
back
from
her
in
the
bed
then
suddenly
he
made
a
great
effort
to
rise
resisting
her
efforts
i
shall
put
you
out
then
he
declared
struggling
against
clasp
upon
his
shoulders
catching
at
her
wrists
his
excitement
was
so
intense
his
fervour
so
great
that
it
could
almost
be
said
he
touched
the
edge
of
his
delirium
again
do
you
hear
do
you
hear
out
of
this
room
no
said
lloyd
calmly
you
must
be
quiet
you
must
try
to
go
to
sleep
this
time
you
can
not
make
me
leave
he
caught
her
by
one
arm
and
bracing
himself
with
the
other
against
the
headboard
of
the
bed
thrust
her
back
from
him
with
all
his
might
keep
away
from
me
i
tell
you
keep
back
you
shall
do
as
i
say
i
have
always
carried
my
point
and
i
shall
not
fail
now
believe
me
i
shall
not
you
you
he
panted
as
he
struggled
with
her
ashamed
of
his
weakness
humiliated
beyond
words
that
she
should
know
it
i
you
shall
you
will
compel
me
to
use
force
do
let
it
come
to
that
calmly
lloyd
took
both
his
wrists
in
the
strong
quiet
clasp
of
one
palm
and
while
she
supported
his
shoulders
with
her
other
arm
laid
him
down
among
the
pillows
again
as
though
he
had
been
a
child
i
i
a
bit
weak
and
trembly
just
now
he
admitted
panting
with
his
exertion
but
lloyd
listen
i
know
how
you
must
dislike
me
now
but
will
you
please
go
go
go
at
once
no
what
a
strange
spinning
of
the
wheel
of
fate
was
here
in
so
short
a
time
had
their
mutual
positions
been
reversed
now
it
was
she
who
was
strong
and
he
who
was
weak
it
was
she
who
conquered
and
he
who
was
subdued
it
was
she
who
triumphed
and
he
who
was
humiliated
it
was
he
who
implored
and
she
who
denied
it
was
her
will
and
no
longer
his
that
must
issue
victorious
from
the
struggle
and
how
complete
now
was
bennett
defeat
the
very
contingency
he
had
fought
so
desperately
to
avert
and
for
which
he
had
sacrificed
ferriss
lloyd
care
of
so
perilous
a
disease
behold
the
mysterious
turn
of
the
wheel
had
brought
it
about
and
now
he
was
powerless
to
resist
oh
he
cried
have
i
not
enough
upon
my
mind
already
ferriss
and
his
death
are
you
going
to
make
me
imperil
your
life
too
and
after
i
have
tried
so
hard
you
must
not
stay
here
i
shall
stay
she
answered
i
order
you
to
go
this
is
my
house
send
the
doctor
here
adler
suddenly
he
fainted
an
hour
or
two
later
in
the
gray
of
the
morning
at
a
time
when
bennett
was
sleeping
quietly
under
the
influence
of
opiates
lloyd
found
herself
sitting
at
the
window
in
front
of
the
small
table
there
her
head
resting
on
her
hand
thoughtful
absorbed
and
watching
with
but
eyes
the
dawn
growing
pink
over
the
tops
of
the
in
the
orchard
near
by
the
window
was
open
just
wide
enough
for
the
proper
ventilation
of
the
room
for
a
long
time
she
sat
thus
without
moving
only
from
time
to
time
smoothing
back
the
heavy
hair
from
her
temples
and
ears
by
degrees
the
thinking
faculties
of
her
brain
as
it
were
a
myriad
of
delicate
interlacing
wheels
slowly
decreased
in
the
rapidity
and
intensity
of
their
functions
she
began
to
feel
instead
of
to
think
as
the
activity
of
her
mind
lapsed
to
a
certain
pleasant
numbness
a
vague
formless
nameless
emotion
seemed
to
be
welling
to
the
surface
it
was
no
longer
a
question
of
the
brain
what
then
was
it
the
heart
she
gave
no
name
to
this
new
emotion
it
was
too
confused
as
yet
too
undefinable
a
certain
great
sweetness
seemed
to
be
coming
upon
her
but
she
could
not
say
whether
she
was
infinitely
sad
or
supremely
happy
a
smile
was
on
her
lips
and
yet
the
tears
began
to
brim
in
her
eyes
she
felt
as
if
some
long
fierce
struggle
or
series
of
struggles
were
at
last
accomplished
as
if
for
a
long
period
of
time
she
had
been
involved
in
the
maze
and
tortuous
passages
of
some
gloomy
cavern
but
at
length
thence
issuing
had
again
beheld
the
stars
a
great
tenderness
a
certain
tremulous
joy
in
all
things
that
were
true
and
good
and
right
grew
big
and
strong
within
her
the
delight
in
living
returned
to
her
the
dawn
was
brightening
and
flushing
over
all
the
world
and
colour
light
and
warmth
were
coming
back
into
her
life
the
night
had
been
still
and
mild
but
now
the
first
breath
of
the
morning
breeze
stirred
in
the
trees
in
the
grass
in
the
flowers
and
the
thick
bushes
along
the
roadside
and
a
delicious
aroma
of
fields
and
woods
and
gardens
came
to
her
the
sweetness
of
life
and
the
sweetness
of
those
things
better
than
life
and
more
enduring
the
things
that
do
not
fail
nor
cease
nor
vanish
away
suddenly
entered
into
that
room
and
descended
upon
her
almost
in
the
sense
of
a
benediction
a
visitation
something
mystic
and
miraculous
it
was
a
moment
to
hope
all
things
to
believe
all
things
to
endure
all
things
she
caught
her
breath
listening
for
what
she
did
not
know
once
again
just
as
it
had
been
in
that
other
dawn
in
that
other
room
where
the
enemy
had
been
conquered
the
sense
of
some
great
happiness
was
in
the
air
was
coming
to
her
swiftly
but
now
the
greater
enemy
had
been
outfought
the
morning
of
a
greater
day
was
breaking
and
spreading
and
the
greatest
happiness
in
the
world
was
preparing
for
her
how
it
had
happened
she
did
not
know
now
was
not
the
moment
to
think
to
reason
to
reflect
it
seemed
as
though
the
rushing
of
wings
was
all
about
her
as
though
a
light
brighter
than
the
day
was
just
about
to
break
upon
her
sight
as
though
a
music
divinely
beautiful
was
just
about
to
burst
upon
her
ear
but
the
light
was
not
for
her
eye
the
music
was
not
for
her
ear
the
radiance
and
the
harmony
came
from
herself
from
within
her
the
intellect
was
numb
only
the
heart
was
alive
on
this
wonderful
midsummer
morning
and
it
was
in
her
heart
that
the
radiance
shone
and
the
harmony
vibrated
back
in
his
place
once
more
high
on
his
throne
the
love
that
she
believed
had
forever
departed
from
her
sat
exalted
and
triumphant
singing
to
the
cadence
of
that
unheard
music
shining
and
magnificent
in
the
glory
of
that
light
would
bennett
live
suddenly
that
question
leaped
up
in
her
mind
and
stood
in
the
eye
of
her
imagination
terrible
menacing
a
hideous
grim
spectre
before
which
lloyd
quailed
with
failing
heart
and
breath
the
light
the
almost
divine
radiance
that
had
burst
upon
her
nevertheless
threw
a
dreadful
shadow
before
it
beneath
the
music
she
heard
the
growl
of
the
thunder
her
happiness
was
not
without
its
accompanying
dismay
love
had
not
returned
to
her
heart
alone
with
it
had
returned
the
old
enemy
she
had
once
believed
had
left
her
forever
now
it
had
come
back
as
before
it
lurked
and
leered
at
her
from
dark
corners
it
crept
to
her
side
to
her
back
ready
to
leap
ready
to
strike
to
clutch
at
her
throat
with
cold
fingers
and
bear
her
to
the
earth
rending
her
heart
with
a
grief
she
told
herself
she
could
not
endure
and
live
she
loved
him
now
with
all
her
mind
and
might
how
could
it
ever
have
been
otherwise
he
belonged
to
her
and
she
why
she
only
lived
with
his
life
she
seemed
so
bound
to
him
as
to
be
part
of
his
very
self
literally
she
could
not
understand
how
it
would
be
possible
for
her
to
live
if
he
should
die
it
seemed
to
her
that
with
his
death
some
mysterious
element
of
her
life
something
vital
and
fundamental
for
which
there
was
no
name
would
disintegrate
upon
the
instant
and
leave
her
without
the
strength
necessary
for
further
existence
but
this
would
however
be
a
relief
the
prospect
of
the
years
after
his
death
the
fearful
loneliness
of
life
without
him
was
a
horror
before
which
she
veritably
believed
her
reason
itself
must
collapse
lloyd
bennett
was
awake
again
and
watching
her
with
feverish
anxiety
from
where
he
lay
among
the
pillows
lloyd
he
repeated
the
voice
once
so
deep
and
powerful
quavering
pitifully
i
was
wrong
i
do
want
you
to
go
do
leave
me
in
an
instant
lloyd
was
at
his
side
kneeling
by
the
bed
she
caught
one
of
the
great
gnarled
hands
seamed
and
corded
and
burning
with
the
fever
never
never
dearest
never
so
long
as
i
shall
live
ix
when
adler
heard
bennett
uncertain
steps
upon
the
stairs
and
the
sound
of
lloyd
voice
speaking
to
him
and
urging
that
there
was
no
hurry
and
that
he
was
to
take
but
one
step
at
a
time
he
wheeled
swiftly
about
from
the
windows
of
the
where
he
had
been
watching
the
october
breeze
stirring
the
crimson
and
yellow
leaves
in
the
orchard
and
drew
back
his
master
chair
from
the
breakfast
table
and
stood
behind
it
expectantly
his
eyes
watching
the
door
lloyd
held
back
the
door
and
bennett
came
in
leaning
heavily
on
pitts
shoulder
adler
stiffened
upon
the
instant
as
if
in
answer
to
some
unheard
and
when
bennett
had
taken
his
seat
pushed
his
chair
gently
to
the
table
and
unfolded
his
napkin
with
a
flourish
as
though
giving
a
banner
to
the
wind
pitts
almost
immediately
left
the
room
but
lloyd
remained
supervising
bennett
breakfast
pouring
his
milk
buttering
his
toast
and
opening
his
eggs
coffee
suddenly
inquired
bennett
lloyd
shook
her
head
not
for
another
week
bennett
looked
with
grim
disfavour
upon
the
glass
of
milk
that
lloyd
had
placed
at
his
elbow
such
slop
he
growled
why
not
a
little
sugar
and
warm
water
and
be
done
with
it
lloyd
i
ca
drink
this
stuff
any
more
why
it
warm
yet
he
exclaimed
aggrievedly
and
with
deep
disgust
abruptly
setting
down
the
glass
why
of
course
it
is
she
answered
we
brought
the
cow
here
especially
for
you
and
the
boy
has
just
done
milking
her
and
it
not
slop
slop
slop
declared
bennett
he
picked
up
the
glass
again
and
looked
at
her
over
the
rim
i
drink
this
stuff
this
one
more
time
to
please
you
he
said
but
i
promise
you
this
will
be
the
last
time
you
need
ask
me
again
i
have
drunk
enough
milk
the
past
three
weeks
to
support
a
foundling
hospital
for
a
year
invariably
since
the
period
of
his
convalescence
began
bennett
made
this
scene
over
his
hourly
glass
of
milk
and
invariably
it
ended
by
his
gulping
it
down
at
nearly
a
single
swallow
adler
brought
in
the
mail
and
the
morning
paper
three
letters
had
come
for
lloyd
and
for
bennett
a
small
volume
on
recent
arctic
research
and
exploration
sent
by
his
publisher
with
a
note
to
the
effect
that
as
the
latest
authority
on
the
subject
bennett
was
sure
to
find
it
of
great
interest
in
an
appendix
inserted
after
the
body
of
the
book
had
been
made
up
the
freja
expedition
and
his
own
work
were
briefly
described
lloyd
put
her
letters
aside
and
unfolding
the
paper
said
i
read
it
while
you
eat
your
breakfast
have
you
everything
you
want
did
you
drink
your
milk
all
of
it
but
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eye
she
noted
that
adler
was
chuckling
behind
the
tray
that
he
held
to
his
face
and
with
growing
suspicion
she
leaned
forward
and
peered
about
among
the
breakfast
things
bennett
had
hidden
his
glass
behind
the
and
it
only
empty
she
declared
ward
why
will
you
be
such
a
boy
oh
well
he
grumbled
and
without
more
ado
drank
off
the
balance
now
i
read
to
you
if
you
have
everything
you
want
adler
i
think
you
can
open
one
of
those
windows
it
so
warm
out
of
doors
while
he
ate
his
breakfast
of
toast
milk
and
eggs
lloyd
skimmed
through
the
paper
reading
aloud
everything
she
thought
would
be
of
interest
to
him
then
after
a
moment
her
eye
was
caught
and
held
by
a
article
expanded
from
an
associated
press
despatch
oh
she
cried
listen
to
this
and
continued
has
been
received
at
this
place
of
the
safe
arrival
of
the
arctic
steamship
curlew
at
tasiusak
on
the
greenland
coast
bearing
eighteen
members
of
the
expedition
captain
duane
reports
all
well
and
an
uneventful
voyage
it
is
his
intention
to
pass
the
winter
at
tasiusak
collecting
dogs
and
also
esquimau
sledges
which
he
believes
superior
to
european
manufacture
for
work
in
and
to
push
on
with
the
curlew
in
the
spring
as
soon
as
smith
sound
shall
be
navigable
this
may
be
later
than
captain
duane
supposes
as
the
whalers
who
have
been
working
in
the
sound
during
the
past
months
bring
back
news
of
an
unusually
early
winter
and
extraordinary
quantities
of
both
in
the
sound
itself
and
in
kane
basin
this
means
a
proportionately
late
open
season
next
year
and
the
curlew
departure
from
tasiusak
may
be
considerably
later
than
anticipated
it
is
considered
by
the
best
arctic
experts
an
unfortunate
circumstance
that
captain
duane
elected
to
winter
south
of
cape
sabine
as
the
condition
of
the
ice
in
smith
sound
can
never
be
relied
upon
nor
foretold
should
the
entrance
to
the
sound
still
be
encumbered
with
ice
as
late
as
july
which
is
by
no
means
impossible
captain
duane
will
be
obliged
to
spend
another
winter
at
tasiusak
or
upernvick
consuming
alike
his
store
of
provisions
and
the
patience
of
his
men
there
was
a
silence
when
lloyd
finished
reading
bennett
chipped
at
the
end
of
his
second
egg
well
she
said
at
length
well
returned
bennett
what
all
that
to
me
it
your
work
she
answered
almost
vehemently
no
indeed
it
duane
work
what
do
you
mean
let
him
try
now
and
you
exclaimed
lloyd
looking
intently
at
him
my
dear
girl
i
had
my
chance
and
failed
now
he
raised
a
shoulder
indifferently
now
i
do
care
much
about
it
i
lost
interest
i
do
believe
you
she
cried
energetically
you
of
all
men
behind
bennett
chair
she
had
a
momentary
glimpse
of
adler
who
had
tucked
his
tray
under
his
arm
and
was
silently
applauding
in
elaborate
pantomime
she
saw
his
lips
form
the
words
that
it
that
right
go
right
ahead
besides
i
have
my
book
to
do
and
besides
that
i
an
invalid
an
invalid
who
drinks
slop
and
you
intend
to
give
it
all
up
your
career
well
if
i
should
what
then
suddenly
he
turned
to
her
abruptly
i
should
not
think
would
want
me
to
go
again
do
urge
me
to
go
lloyd
made
a
sudden
little
gasp
and
her
hand
involuntarily
closed
upon
his
as
it
rested
near
her
on
the
table
oh
no
she
cried
oh
no
i
do
you
are
right
it
not
your
work
now
well
then
muttered
bennett
as
though
the
question
was
forever
settled
lloyd
turned
to
her
mail
and
one
after
another
slit
the
envelopes
woman
fashion
with
a
shell
hairpin
but
while
she
was
glancing
over
the
contents
of
her
letters
bennett
began
to
stir
uneasily
in
his
place
from
time
to
time
he
stopped
eating
and
shot
a
glance
at
lloyd
from
under
his
frown
noting
the
crisp
white
texture
of
her
gown
and
waist
the
white
scarf
with
its
high
tight
bands
about
the
neck
the
tiny
golden
buttons
in
her
cuffs
the
sombre
ruddy
glow
of
her
cheeks
her
eyes
and
the
piles
and
coils
of
her
hair
then
abruptly
he
said
adler
you
can
go
adler
saluted
and
withdrew
whom
are
your
letters
from
bennett
demanded
by
way
of
a
beginning
lloyd
replaced
the
hairpin
in
her
hair
answering
from
street
from
louise
douglass
and
from
mr
campbell
hum
well
what
do
they
say
street
and
louise
douglass
street
asks
me
to
take
a
very
important
surgical
case
as
soon
as
i
get
through
here
of
the
most
important
and
delicate
as
well
as
one
of
the
most
interesting
operations
in
his
professional
experience
those
are
his
words
louise
writes
four
pages
but
she
says
nothing
just
chatters
and
campbell
bennett
indicated
with
his
chin
the
third
rather
voluminous
letter
at
lloyd
elbow
he
seems
to
have
written
rather
more
than
four
pages
what
does
he
say
does
he
too
lloyd
smoothed
back
her
hair
from
one
temple
h
no
he
says
something
but
never
mind
what
he
says
ward
i
must
be
going
back
to
the
city
you
do
need
a
nurse
any
more
what
that
bennett
frown
gathered
on
the
instant
and
with
a
sharp
movement
of
the
head
that
was
habitual
to
him
he
brought
his
one
good
eye
to
bear
upon
her
lloyd
repeated
her
statement
answering
his
remonstrance
and
expostulation
with
you
are
almost
perfectly
well
and
it
would
not
be
at
all
discreet
for
me
to
stay
here
an
hour
longer
than
absolutely
necessary
i
shall
go
back
or
next
day
but
i
tell
you
i
am
still
very
sick
i
a
poor
miserable
shattered
wreck
he
made
a
great
show
of
coughing
in
hollow
lamentable
tones
listen
to
that
and
last
night
i
had
a
high
fever
and
this
morning
i
had
a
queer
sort
of
pain
about
here
he
vaguely
indicated
the
region
of
his
chest
i
think
i
am
about
to
have
a
relapse
nonsense
you
ca
frighten
me
at
all
oh
well
he
answered
easily
i
shall
go
with
you
that
is
all
i
suppose
you
want
to
see
me
venture
out
in
such
raw
bleak
weather
as
this
with
my
weak
lungs
your
weak
lungs
how
long
since
well
i
i
sometimes
thought
my
lungs
were
not
very
strong
why
dear
me
you
poor
thing
i
suppose
the
climate
at
kolyuchin
bay
a
trifle
too
bracing
what
does
campbell
say
and
the
diet
too
rich
for
your
blood
what
does
campbell
say
and
perhaps
you
did
overexert
lloyd
searight
what
does
campbell
say
in
that
he
asks
me
to
marry
him
to
mum
mar
marry
him
well
damn
his
impudence
campbell
is
an
eminently
respectable
and
worthy
gentleman
oh
well
i
do
care
go
go
marry
campbell
be
happy
i
forgive
you
both
go
leave
me
to
die
alone
sir
i
will
go
forget
that
you
ever
knew
an
unhappy
wom
female
whose
only
fault
was
that
she
loved
you
go
and
sometimes
think
of
me
far
away
on
the
billow
and
drop
a
silent
tear
i
say
how
are
you
going
to
answer
campbell
letter
just
one
word
lloyd
be
serious
this
is
no
joke
joke
she
repeated
hollowly
it
is
indeed
a
sorry
joke
ah
had
i
but
loved
with
a
girlish
love
it
would
have
been
better
for
me
then
suddenly
she
caught
him
about
the
neck
with
both
her
arms
and
kissed
him
on
the
cheek
and
on
the
lips
a
little
quiver
running
through
her
to
her
her
mood
changing
abruptly
to
a
deep
sweet
earnestness
oh
ward
ward
she
cried
all
our
unhappiness
and
all
our
sorrow
and
trials
and
anxiety
and
cruel
suspense
are
over
now
and
now
we
really
have
each
other
and
love
each
other
dear
and
all
the
years
to
come
are
only
going
to
bring
happiness
to
us
and
draw
us
closer
and
nearer
to
each
other
but
here
a
point
lloyd
said
bennett
after
a
few
moments
and
when
they
had
returned
to
coherent
speech
how
about
your
work
you
talk
about
my
career
what
about
yours
we
are
to
be
married
but
i
know
just
how
you
have
loved
your
work
it
will
be
a
hard
wrench
for
you
if
you
give
that
up
i
am
not
sure
that
i
should
ask
it
of
you
this
letter
of
street
now
i
know
just
how
eager
you
must
be
to
take
charge
of
such
operations
such
important
cases
as
he
mentions
it
would
be
very
selfish
of
me
to
ask
you
to
give
up
your
work
it
your
your
profession
your
career
lloyd
took
up
street
letter
and
holding
it
delicately
at
length
tore
it
in
two
and
let
the
pieces
flutter
to
the
floor
that
for
my
said
lloyd
searight
as
she
drew
back
from
him
an
instant
later
bennett
all
at
once
and
very
earnestly
demanded
lloyd
do
you
love
me
with
all
my
heart
ward
and
you
will
be
my
wife
you
know
that
i
will
then
bennett
picked
up
the
little
volume
of
arctic
research
which
he
had
received
that
morning
and
tossed
it
from
him
upon
the
floor
that
for
my
career
he
answered
for
a
moment
they
were
silent
looking
gladly
into
each
other
eyes
then
bennett
drew
her
to
him
again
and
held
her
close
to
him
and
once
more
she
put
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
nestled
her
head
down
upon
his
shoulder
with
a
little
comfortable
sigh
of
contentment
and
relief
and
quiet
joy
for
that
the
long
fierce
trial
was
over
that
there
were
no
more
fights
to
be
fought
no
more
grim
hard
situations
to
face
no
more
relentless
duties
to
be
done
she
had
endured
and
she
had
prevailed
now
her
reward
was
come
now
for
the
long
calm
years
of
happiness
later
in
the
day
about
an
hour
after
noon
bennett
took
his
daily
nap
carefully
wrapped
in
shawls
and
stretched
out
in
a
wicker
in
the
lloyd
in
the
meantime
was
busy
in
the
garden
at
the
side
of
the
house
gathering
flowers
which
she
intended
to
put
in
a
huge
china
bowl
in
bennett
room
while
she
was
thus
occupied
adler
followed
by
kamiska
came
up
adler
pulled
off
his
cap
i
beg
pardon
miss
he
began
turning
his
cap
about
between
his
fingers
i
do
want
to
seem
to
intrude
and
if
i
do
i
just
guess
you
better
tell
me
so
first
off
but
what
did
he
say
or
did
he
say
anything
the
captain
i
mean
this
morning
about
going
up
again
i
heard
you
talking
to
him
at
breakfast
that
it
that
the
kind
of
talk
he
needs
i
ca
talk
that
talk
to
him
i
so
main
scared
of
him
i
would
believed
the
captain
would
ever
say
he
give
up
would
ever
say
he
was
beaten
but
miss
i
thinking
as
there
something
wrong
main
wrong
with
the
captain
these
days
besides
fever
getting
soft
that
what
he
is
if
you
only
know
the
man
that
he
was
before
while
we
was
up
there
in
the
ice
that
his
work
what
he
cut
out
for
there
ai
nobody
can
do
it
but
him
and
to
see
him
quit
to
see
him
chuck
up
his
chance
to
a
like
duane
a
coastwise
college
professor
that
do
know
no
more
about
ice
than
than
you
do
it
regularly
makes
me
sick
why
what
will
become
of
the
captain
now
if
he
quits
he
just
settle
down
to
an
ordinary
professor
and
write
articles
for
the
papers
and
magazines
and
maybe
he
get
down
to
lecturing
just
fancy
miss
him
the
captain
lecturing
and
while
he
stays
at
home
and
writes
and
oh
lord
lectures
somebody
else
without
a
fifth
of
his
ability
will
do
the
it
just
naturally
break
my
heart
it
will
exclaimed
adler
if
the
captain
chucks
i
would
be
so
main
sorry
that
he
wo
reach
the
pole
as
that
he
quit
trying
as
that
a
man
like
the
captain
or
like
what
i
thought
he
was
gave
up
and
chucked
when
he
could
win
but
adler
returned
lloyd
the
captain
bennett
it
seems
to
me
has
done
his
share
think
what
he
been
through
you
ca
have
forgotten
the
march
to
kolyuchin
bay
but
adler
made
an
impatient
gesture
with
the
hand
that
held
the
cap
the
danger
do
figure
what
he
have
to
go
through
with
figure
the
chances
of
life
or
death
do
figure
nothing
in
the
world
do
figure
his
god
cut
him
out
for
that
and
he
got
to
do
it
ai
you
got
any
influence
with
him
miss
wo
you
talk
good
talk
to
him
do
let
him
chuck
do
let
him
get
soft
make
him
be
a
man
and
not
a
professor
when
adler
had
left
her
lloyd
sank
into
a
little
seat
at
the
edge
of
the
garden
walk
and
let
the
flowers
drop
into
her
lap
and
leaned
back
in
her
place
and
thoughtful
reviewing
in
her
imagination
the
events
of
the
past
few
months
what
a
change
that
summer
had
brought
to
both
of
them
how
they
had
been
shaped
anew
in
the
mould
of
circumstance
suddenly
and
without
warning
they
two
strong
determined
had
clashed
together
the
man
force
against
the
strength
and
the
woman
inherently
weaker
had
been
crushed
and
humbled
for
a
time
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
been
broken
beyond
hope
so
humbled
that
she
could
never
rise
again
as
though
a
great
crisis
had
developed
in
her
life
and
that
having
failed
once
she
must
fail
again
and
again
and
again
as
if
her
whole
subsequent
life
must
be
one
long
failure
but
a
greater
crisis
had
followed
hard
upon
the
heels
of
the
first
the
struggle
with
self
the
greatest
struggle
of
all
against
the
abstract
principle
of
evil
the
woman
who
had
failed
in
the
material
conflict
with
a
masculine
masterful
will
had
succeeded
had
conquered
self
had
been
true
when
it
was
easy
to
be
false
had
dared
the
judgment
of
her
peers
so
only
that
she
might
not
deceive
her
momentary
perhaps
fancied
hatred
of
bennett
who
had
so
cruelly
misunderstood
and
humiliated
her
had
apparently
of
its
own
accord
departed
from
her
heart
then
had
come
the
hour
when
the
strange
hazard
of
fortune
had
reversed
their
former
positions
when
she
could
be
masterful
while
he
was
weak
when
it
was
the
man
turn
to
be
broken
to
be
prevailed
against
her
own
discomfiture
had
been
offset
by
his
she
no
longer
need
look
to
him
as
her
conqueror
her
master
and
when
she
had
seen
him
so
weak
so
pathetically
unable
to
resist
the
lightest
pressure
of
her
hand
when
it
was
given
her
not
only
to
witness
but
to
relieve
his
suffering
the
great
love
for
him
that
could
not
die
had
returned
with
the
mastery
of
self
had
come
the
forgetfulness
of
self
and
her
profession
her
of
which
she
had
been
so
proud
had
seemed
to
her
of
small
concern
now
she
was
his
and
his
life
was
hers
she
should
so
she
told
herself
be
henceforward
happy
in
his
happiness
and
her
only
pride
would
be
the
pride
in
his
achievements
but
now
the
unexpected
had
happened
and
bennett
had
given
up
his
career
during
the
period
of
bennett
convalescence
lloyd
had
often
talked
long
and
earnestly
with
him
and
partly
from
what
he
had
told
her
and
partly
from
much
that
she
inferred
she
had
at
last
been
able
to
trace
out
and
follow
the
mental
processes
and
changes
through
which
bennett
had
passed
he
too
had
been
proved
by
fire
he
too
had
had
his
ordeal
his
trial
by
nature
by
training
and
by
virtue
of
the
life
he
lived
bennett
had
been
a
man
harsh
somewhat
brutal
inordinately
selfish
and
at
all
times
magnificently
arrogant
he
had
neither
patience
nor
toleration
for
natural
human
weakness
while
selfish
he
was
not
and
it
never
occurred
to
him
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
see
that
he
was
a
giant
among
men
his
heart
was
callous
his
whole
nature
and
character
hard
and
flinty
from
the
buffetings
he
gave
rather
than
received
then
had
come
misfortune
ferriss
had
died
and
bennett
recognition
and
acknowledgment
of
the
fact
that
he
ward
bennett
who
never
failed
who
never
blundered
had
made
at
last
the
great
and
terrible
error
of
his
life
had
shaken
his
character
to
its
very
foundations
this
was
only
the
beginning
the
breach
once
made
humanity
entered
into
the
gloomy
waste
places
of
his
soul
remorse
crowded
hard
upon
his
wonted
arrogance
generosity
and
the
impulse
to
make
amends
took
the
place
of
selfishness
kindness
thrust
out
the
native
brutality
the
harshness
and
imperiousness
gave
way
to
a
certain
spirit
of
toleration
it
was
the
influence
of
these
new
emotions
that
had
moved
bennett
to
make
the
statement
to
adler
that
had
so
astonished
and
perplexed
his
subordinate
he
bennett
too
like
lloyd
was
at
that
time
endeavouring
to
free
himself
from
a
false
position
and
through
the
medium
of
confession
stand
in
his
true
colours
in
the
eyes
of
his
associates
unconsciously
they
were
both
working
out
their
salvation
along
the
same
lines
then
had
come
bennett
resolve
to
give
ferriss
the
conspicuous
and
prominent
place
in
his
book
the
account
of
the
expedition
the
more
bennett
dwelt
upon
ferriss
heroism
intelligence
and
ability
the
more
his
task
became
a
labour
of
love
and
the
more
the
idea
of
self
dropped
away
from
his
thought
and
imagination
then
and
perhaps
this
was
not
the
least
important
factor
in
bennett
transformation
sickness
had
befallen
the
strong
and
man
had
been
brought
to
the
weakness
of
a
child
whom
the
pressure
of
a
finger
could
control
he
suddenly
changed
places
with
the
woman
he
believed
he
had
at
such
fearful
cost
broken
and
subdued
his
physical
strength
once
so
enormous
was
as
a
reed
in
the
woman
hand
his
will
so
indomitable
was
as
powerless
as
an
infant
before
the
woman
calm
resolve
rising
up
there
before
him
and
overmastering
him
at
a
time
he
believed
it
to
be
forever
weakened
bennett
had
come
forth
from
the
ordeal
chastened
softened
and
humbled
but
he
was
shattered
broken
brought
to
the
earth
with
sorrow
and
the
load
of
unavailing
regret
ambition
was
numb
and
lifeless
within
him
reaction
from
his
former
attitude
of
aggression
and
defiance
had
carried
him
far
beyond
the
normal
here
widened
the
difference
between
the
man
and
the
woman
discontinuance
of
her
had
been
in
the
nature
of
heroic
subjugation
of
self
bennett
abandonment
of
his
career
was
hardly
better
than
weakness
in
the
one
it
had
been
renunciation
in
the
other
surrender
in
the
end
and
after
all
was
over
it
was
the
woman
who
remained
the
stronger
but
for
her
the
woman
was
it
true
that
all
was
over
had
the
last
conflict
been
fought
was
it
not
rather
to
be
believed
that
life
was
one
long
conflict
was
it
not
for
her
lloyd
to
rouse
that
sluggard
ambition
was
not
this
her
career
after
all
to
be
his
inspiration
his
incentive
to
urge
him
to
the
accomplishment
of
a
great
work
now
of
the
two
she
was
the
stronger
in
these
new
conditions
what
was
her
duty
adler
clumsy
phrases
persisted
in
her
mind
that
his
work
adler
had
said
god
almighty
cut
him
out
for
that
and
he
got
to
do
it
do
let
him
chuck
do
let
him
get
soft
make
him
be
a
man
and
not
a
professor
had
she
so
much
influence
over
bennett
could
she
rouse
the
restless
daring
spirit
again
perhaps
but
what
would
it
mean
for
her
for
her
who
must
be
left
behind
to
wait
and
wait
and
wait
for
three
years
for
five
years
for
ten
years
perhaps
forever
and
now
at
this
moment
when
she
believed
that
at
last
happiness
had
come
to
her
when
the
duty
had
been
done
the
grim
problems
solved
when
sickness
had
been
overcome
when
love
had
come
back
and
the
calm
untroubled
days
seemed
lengthening
out
ahead
there
came
to
her
recollection
the
hideous
lapse
of
time
that
had
intervened
between
the
departure
of
the
freja
and
the
expedition
return
what
sleepless
nights
what
days
of
unspeakable
suspense
what
dreadful
alternations
between
hope
and
despair
what
silent
repressed
suffering
what
haunting
dread
of
a
thing
she
dared
not
name
was
the
fear
to
come
into
her
life
again
the
enemy
that
lurked
and
leered
and
forebore
to
strike
that
hung
upon
her
heels
at
every
hour
of
the
day
that
sat
down
with
her
to
her
every
occupation
that
followed
after
when
she
stirred
abroad
that
came
close
to
her
in
the
still
watches
of
the
night
creeping
creeping
to
her
bedside
looming
over
her
in
the
darkness
the
cold
fingers
reaching
closer
and
closer
the
awful
face
growing
ever
more
distinct
till
the
suspense
of
waiting
for
the
blow
to
fall
for
the
fingers
to
grip
became
more
than
she
could
bear
and
she
sprang
from
her
bed
with
a
stifled
sob
of
anguish
driven
from
her
rest
with
quivering
lips
and
streaming
eyes
abruptly
lloyd
rose
to
her
feet
the
flowers
falling
unheeded
from
her
lap
her
arms
rigid
at
her
side
her
hands
shut
tight
no
she
murmured
i
can
not
this
at
last
is
more
than
i
can
do
instantly
adler
halting
words
went
ringing
through
her
brain
the
danger
do
figure
nothing
in
the
world
do
figure
it
his
work
adler
words
were
the
words
of
the
world
she
alone
of
the
thousands
whose
eyes
were
turned
toward
bennett
was
blinded
she
was
wrong
she
belonged
to
him
but
he
did
not
belong
to
her
the
world
demanded
him
the
world
called
him
from
her
side
to
do
the
terrible
work
that
god
had
made
him
for
was
she
because
she
loved
him
because
of
her
own
single
anguish
to
stand
between
him
and
the
clamour
of
the
world
between
him
and
his
work
between
him
and
god
a
work
there
was
for
him
to
do
he
must
play
the
man
part
the
battle
must
be
fought
again
that
horrible
grisly
enemy
far
up
there
to
the
north
upon
the
high
curve
of
the
globe
the
shoulder
of
the
world
huge
remorseless
terrible
in
its
vast
titanic
strength
guarding
its
secret
through
all
the
centuries
in
the
innermost
of
a
thousand
gleaming
coils
must
be
defied
again
the
monster
that
defended
the
great
prize
the
object
of
so
many
fruitless
quests
must
be
once
more
attacked
his
was
the
work
for
him
the
shock
of
battle
the
rigour
of
the
fight
the
fierce
assault
the
ceaseless
onset
the
unfailing
and
unflinching
courage
hers
was
the
woman
part
already
she
had
assumed
it
steadfast
unselfishness
renunciation
patience
the
heroism
greater
than
all
others
that
sits
with
folded
hands
quiet
unshaken
and
under
fearful
stress
endures
and
endures
and
endures
to
be
the
inspiration
of
great
deeds
high
hopes
and
firm
resolves
and
then
while
the
fight
was
dared
to
wait
in
calmness
for
its
issue
that
was
her
duty
that
the
woman
part
in
the
world
great
work
lloyd
was
dimly
conscious
of
a
certain
sweet
and
subtle
element
in
her
love
for
bennett
that
only
of
late
she
had
begun
to
recognise
and
be
aware
of
this
was
a
certain
vague
protective
almost
maternal
instinct
perhaps
it
was
because
of
his
present
weakness
both
of
body
and
character
or
perhaps
it
was
an
element
always
to
be
found
in
the
deep
and
earnest
love
of
any
woman
she
felt
that
she
not
as
herself
individually
but
as
a
woman
was
not
only
stronger
than
bennett
but
in
a
manner
older
more
mature
she
was
conscious
of
depths
in
her
nature
far
greater
than
in
his
and
also
that
she
was
capable
of
attaining
heights
of
heroism
devotion
and
sacrifice
which
he
for
all
his
masculine
force
could
not
only
never
reach
but
could
not
even
conceive
of
it
was
this
consciousness
of
her
larger
better
nature
that
made
her
feel
for
bennett
somewhat
as
a
mother
feels
for
a
son
a
sister
for
her
younger
brother
a
great
tenderness
mingled
with
her
affection
a
vast
and
almost
divine
magnanimity
a
broad
womanly
pity
for
his
shortcomings
his
errors
his
faults
it
was
to
her
he
must
look
for
encouragement
it
was
for
her
to
bind
up
and
reshape
the
great
energy
that
had
been
so
rudely
checked
and
not
only
to
call
back
his
strength
but
to
guide
it
and
direct
into
its
appointed
channels
lloyd
returned
toward
the
veranda
to
find
bennett
just
arousing
from
his
nap
she
drew
the
shawls
closer
about
him
and
rearranged
the
pillows
under
his
head
and
then
sat
down
on
the
steps
near
at
hand
tell
me
about
this
captain
duane
she
began
where
is
he
now
bennett
yawned
and
passed
his
hand
across
his
face
rubbing
the
sleep
from
his
eyes
what
time
is
it
i
must
have
slept
over
an
hour
duane
why
you
saw
what
the
paper
said
i
presume
he
is
at
tasiusak
do
you
think
he
will
succeed
do
you
think
he
will
reach
the
pole
adler
thinks
he
wo
oh
perhaps
if
he
has
luck
and
an
open
season
but
tell
me
why
does
he
take
so
many
men
is
that
contrary
to
the
custom
i
know
a
great
deal
about
arctic
work
while
you
were
away
i
read
every
book
i
could
get
upon
the
subject
the
best
work
has
been
done
with
small
expeditions
if
you
should
go
again
when
you
go
again
will
you
take
so
many
i
saw
you
quoted
somewhere
as
being
in
favour
of
only
six
or
eight
men
ten
should
be
the
limit
but
some
one
else
will
make
the
attempt
now
i
out
of
it
i
tried
and
failed
failed
you
the
idea
of
you
ever
failing
of
you
ever
giving
up
of
course
it
was
all
very
well
to
joke
this
morning
about
giving
up
your
career
but
i
know
you
will
be
up
and
away
again
only
too
soon
i
am
trying
to
school
myself
to
expect
that
lloyd
i
tell
you
that
i
am
out
of
it
i
do
believe
the
pole
ever
can
be
reached
and
i
do
much
care
whether
it
is
reached
or
not
suddenly
lloyd
turned
to
him
the
unwonted
light
flashing
in
her
eyes
do
though
she
cried
vehemently
it
can
be
done
and
we
america
ought
to
do
it
bennett
stared
at
her
startled
by
her
outburst
this
english
expedition
lloyd
continued
the
colour
flushing
in
her
cheeks
this
expedition
they
will
have
the
start
of
everybody
next
year
nearly
every
attempt
that
is
made
now
establishes
a
new
record
for
a
high
latitude
one
nation
after
another
is
creeping
nearer
and
nearer
almost
every
year
and
each
expedition
is
profiting
by
the
experiences
and
observations
made
by
the
one
that
preceded
it
some
day
and
not
very
long
now
some
nation
is
going
to
succeed
and
plant
its
flag
there
at
last
why
should
it
not
be
us
why
should
flag
be
first
at
the
pole
we
who
have
had
so
many
heroes
such
great
sailors
such
splendid
leaders
such
explorers
our
stanleys
our
farraguts
our
decaturs
our
de
longs
our
lockwoods
how
we
would
stand
ashamed
before
the
world
if
some
other
nation
should
succeed
where
we
have
all
but
succeeded
norway
or
france
or
russia
or
england
profiting
by
our
experiences
following
where
we
have
made
the
way
that
is
very
fine
admitted
bennett
it
would
be
a
great
honour
the
greatest
perhaps
and
once
i
well
i
had
my
ambitions
too
but
all
different
now
something
in
me
died
when
dick
when
i
oh
let
duane
try
let
him
do
his
best
i
know
it
ca
be
done
and
if
he
should
win
i
would
be
the
first
to
wire
congratulations
lloyd
i
care
i
lost
interest
i
suppose
it
is
my
punishment
i
out
of
the
race
i
a
back
number
i
down
lloyd
shook
her
head
i
do
i
ca
believe
you
do
you
want
to
see
me
go
demanded
bennett
after
this
last
experience
do
you
urge
me
to
it
lloyd
turned
her
head
away
leaning
it
against
one
of
the
veranda
pillars
a
sudden
dimness
swam
in
her
eyes
the
choking
ache
she
knew
so
well
came
to
her
throat
ah
life
was
hard
for
her
the
very
greatness
of
her
nature
drove
from
her
the
happiness
so
constantly
attained
by
little
minds
by
commonplace
souls
when
was
it
to
end
this
continual
sacrifice
of
inclination
to
duty
this
eternal
abnegation
this
yielding
up
of
herself
her
dearest
most
cherished
wishes
to
the
demands
of
duty
and
the
great
world
i
do
know
what
i
want
she
said
faintly
it
do
seem
as
if
one
be
happy
very
long
all
at
once
she
moved
close
to
him
and
laid
her
cheek
upon
the
arm
of
his
chair
and
clasped
his
hand
in
both
her
own
murmuring
but
i
have
you
now
i
have
you
now
no
matter
what
is
coming
to
us
a
sense
of
weakness
overcame
her
what
did
she
care
that
bennett
should
fulfil
his
destiny
should
round
out
his
career
should
continue
to
be
the
great
man
it
was
he
bennett
that
she
loved
not
his
greatness
not
his
career
let
it
all
go
let
ambition
die
let
others
less
worthy
succeed
in
the
mighty
task
what
were
fame
and
honour
and
glory
and
the
sense
of
a
divinely
appointed
duty
done
at
last
to
the
clasp
of
his
hand
and
the
sound
of
his
voice
in
november
of
that
year
lloyd
and
bennett
were
married
two
guests
only
assisted
at
the
ceremony
these
were
campbell
and
his
little
daughter
hattie
x
the
months
passed
christmas
came
and
went
until
then
the
winter
had
been
unusually
mild
but
january
set
in
with
a
succession
of
vicious
cold
snaps
and
great
blustering
winds
out
of
the
northeast
lloyd
and
bennett
had
elected
to
remain
quietly
in
their
new
home
at
medford
they
had
no
desire
to
travel
and
bennett
forthcoming
book
demanded
his
attention
adler
stayed
on
about
the
house
he
and
the
dog
kamiska
were
companions
inseparable
at
long
intervals
visitors
presented
themselves
street
or
pitts
or
certain
friends
of
bennett
but
the
great
rush
of
interviewers
editors
and
projectors
of
marvellous
schemes
that
had
crowded
bennett
anterooms
during
the
spring
and
early
summer
was
conspicuously
dwindling
the
press
ceased
to
speak
of
him
even
his
mail
had
fallen
away
now
whenever
the
journals
of
the
day
devoted
space
to
arctic
exploration
it
was
invariably
in
reference
to
the
english
expedition
wintering
on
the
greenland
coast
that
world
that
had
clamoured
so
loudly
upon
bennett
return
while
perhaps
not
yet
forgetting
him
was
already
ignoring
him
was
looking
in
other
directions
another
man
was
in
the
public
eye
but
in
every
sense
these
two
lloyd
and
bennett
were
out
of
the
world
they
had
freed
themselves
from
the
current
of
affairs
they
stood
aside
while
the
great
tide
went
careering
past
swift
and
turbulent
and
one
of
them
at
least
lacked
even
the
interest
to
look
on
and
watch
its
progress
for
a
time
lloyd
was
supremely
happy
their
life
was
unbroken
uneventful
the
calm
monotonous
days
of
undisturbed
happiness
to
which
she
had
looked
forward
were
come
at
last
thus
it
was
always
to
be
isolated
and
apart
she
could
shut
her
ears
to
the
thunder
of
the
world
great
tide
that
somewhere
off
beyond
the
hills
in
the
direction
of
the
city
went
swirling
through
its
channels
hardly
an
hour
went
by
that
she
and
bennett
were
not
together
lloyd
had
transferred
her
stable
to
her
new
home
lewis
was
added
to
the
number
of
their
servants
and
until
bennett
vigour
completely
returned
to
him
she
drove
out
almost
daily
with
her
husband
covering
the
country
for
miles
around
much
of
their
time
however
they
spent
in
bennett
study
this
was
a
great
apartment
in
the
rear
of
the
house
scantily
almost
meanly
furnished
papers
littered
the
floor
bundles
of
manuscripts
lists
charts
and
observations
the
worn
and
battered
tin
box
of
records
journals
tables
of
logarithms
were
piled
upon
desk
a
bookcase
crammed
with
volumes
of
reference
statistical
pamphlets
and
the
like
stood
between
the
windows
while
one
of
the
walls
was
nearly
entirely
occupied
by
a
vast
map
of
the
arctic
circle
upon
which
the
course
of
the
freja
her
drift
in
the
pack
and
the
route
of
the
expedition
southerly
march
were
accurately
plotted
the
room
was
bare
of
ornament
the
desk
and
a
couple
of
chairs
were
its
only
furniture
pictures
there
were
none
their
places
were
taken
by
photographs
and
a
great
blue
print
of
the
shipbuilder
plans
and
specifications
of
the
freja
the
photographs
were
some
of
those
that
dennison
had
made
of
the
expedition
the
freja
nipped
in
the
ice
a
group
of
the
officers
and
crew
upon
the
forward
deck
the
coast
of
wrangel
island
cape
kammeni
peculiar
ice
formations
views
of
the
pack
under
different
conditions
and
temperatures
and
scenes
of
the
expedition
daily
life
in
the
arctic
the
manufacture
of
sledges
bennett
taking
soundings
and
reading
the
and
one
the
last
view
of
the
freja
taken
just
as
the
ship
her
dripping
bows
heaved
high
in
the
air
the
flag
still
at
the
peak
sank
from
sight
however
on
the
wall
over
the
plans
of
the
freja
one
of
the
boat
flags
that
had
been
used
by
the
expedition
throughout
all
the
time
of
its
stay
in
the
ice
hung
suspended
a
faded
tattered
square
of
stars
and
bars
as
the
new
life
settled
quietly
and
evenly
to
its
grooves
a
routine
began
to
develop
about
an
hour
after
breakfast
lloyd
and
bennett
shut
themselves
in
bennett
workroom
as
he
called
it
lloyd
taking
her
place
at
the
desk
she
had
become
his
amanuensis
had
insisted
upon
writing
to
his
dictation
look
at
that
manuscript
she
had
exclaimed
one
day
turning
the
sheets
that
bennett
had
written
literally
the
very
worst
handwriting
i
have
ever
seen
what
do
you
suppose
a
printer
would
make
out
of
your
and
it
hieroglyphics
you
know
she
informed
him
gravely
nodding
her
head
at
him
it
was
quite
true
bennett
wrote
with
amazing
rapidity
and
with
ragged
vigorous
strokes
of
the
pen
not
unfrequently
driving
the
point
through
the
paper
itself
his
script
was
pothooks
clumsy
slanting
in
all
directions
all
but
illegible
in
the
end
lloyd
had
almost
pushed
him
from
his
place
at
the
desk
taking
the
pen
from
between
his
fingers
exclaiming
get
up
give
me
your
chair
and
that
pen
handwriting
like
that
is
nothing
else
but
a
sin
bennett
allowed
her
to
bully
him
protesting
merely
for
the
enjoyment
of
squabbling
with
her
come
i
like
this
what
are
you
doing
in
my
workroom
anyhow
bennett
i
think
you
had
better
go
to
your
housework
do
talk
she
answered
here
are
your
notes
and
journal
now
tell
me
what
to
write
in
the
end
matters
adjusted
themselves
daily
lloyd
took
her
place
at
the
desk
pen
in
hand
the
sleeve
of
her
right
arm
rolled
back
to
the
elbow
a
habit
of
hers
whenever
writing
and
which
bennett
found
to
be
charming
beyond
words
her
pen
travelling
steadily
from
line
to
line
he
on
his
part
paced
the
floor
a
cigar
between
his
teeth
his
notes
and
in
his
hand
dictating
comments
of
his
own
or
quoting
from
the
pages
stained
frayed
and
crumpled
written
by
the
light
of
the
auroras
the
midnight
suns
or
the
unsteady
flickering
of
lanterns
and
what
long
delicious
hours
they
spent
thus
as
the
winter
drew
on
in
the
absolute
quiet
of
that
country
house
ignored
and
lost
in
the
brown
bare
fields
and
leafless
orchards
of
the
open
country
no
one
troubled
them
no
one
came
near
them
they
asked
nothing
better
than
that
the
world
wherein
they
once
had
lived
whose
hurtling
activity
and
febrile
unrest
they
both
had
known
so
well
should
leave
them
alone
only
one
jarring
note
and
that
none
too
resonant
broke
the
long
harmony
of
lloyd
happiness
during
these
days
bennett
was
deaf
to
it
but
for
lloyd
it
vibrated
continuously
and
as
time
passed
with
increasing
insistence
and
distinctness
but
for
one
person
in
the
world
lloyd
could
have
told
herself
that
her
life
was
without
a
single
element
of
discontent
this
was
adler
it
was
not
that
his
presence
about
the
house
was
a
reproach
to
bennett
wife
for
the
man
was
scrupulously
unobtrusive
he
had
the
instinctive
delicacy
that
one
sometimes
discovers
in
simple
undeveloped
natures
seafaring
folk
especially
and
though
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
leave
his
former
chief
he
had
withdrawn
himself
more
than
ever
from
notice
since
the
time
of
bennett
marriage
he
rarely
even
waited
on
the
table
these
days
for
lloyd
and
bennett
often
chose
to
breakfast
and
dine
quite
to
themselves
but
for
all
that
lloyd
saw
adler
from
time
to
time
kamiska
invariably
at
his
heels
she
came
upon
him
polishing
the
brasses
upon
the
door
of
the
house
or
binding
strips
of
burlaps
and
sacking
about
the
in
the
garden
or
returning
from
the
village
with
the
mail
invariably
wearing
the
same
woollen
cap
the
old
and
the
jersey
with
the
name
freja
upon
the
breast
he
rarely
spoke
to
her
unless
she
first
addressed
him
and
then
always
with
a
precise
salute
bringing
his
heels
sharply
together
standing
stiffly
at
attention
but
the
man
though
all
unwittingly
radiated
gloom
lloyd
readily
saw
that
adler
was
labouring
under
a
certain
cloud
of
disappointment
and
deferred
hope
naturally
she
understood
the
cause
lloyd
was
too
to
feel
any
irritation
at
the
sight
of
adler
but
she
could
not
regard
him
with
indifference
to
her
mind
he
stood
for
all
that
bennett
had
given
up
for
the
great
career
that
had
stopped
for
the
work
half
done
the
task
only
half
completed
in
a
way
was
not
adler
now
superior
to
bennett
his
one
thought
and
aim
and
hope
was
to
try
again
his
ambition
was
yet
alive
and
alight
the
soldier
was
willing
where
the
chief
lost
heart
never
again
had
adler
addressed
himself
to
lloyd
on
the
subject
of
bennett
inactivity
now
he
seemed
to
understand
to
realise
that
once
married
and
to
lloyd
he
must
no
longer
expect
bennett
to
continue
the
work
all
this
lloyd
interpreted
from
adler
attitude
and
again
and
again
told
herself
that
she
could
read
the
man
thoughts
aright
she
even
fancied
she
caught
a
mute
appeal
in
his
eyes
upon
those
rare
occasions
when
they
met
as
though
he
looked
to
her
as
the
only
hope
the
only
means
to
wake
bennett
from
his
lethargy
she
imagined
that
she
heard
him
say
ai
you
got
any
influence
with
him
miss
wo
you
talk
good
talk
to
him
do
let
him
chuck
make
him
be
a
man
and
not
a
professor
nothing
else
in
the
world
do
figure
it
his
work
god
cut
him
out
for
that
and
he
got
to
do
it
his
work
his
work
god
made
him
for
that
appointed
the
task
made
the
man
and
now
she
came
between
god
man
and
the
work
the
three
vast
elements
of
an
entire
system
the
whole
universe
epitomised
in
the
tremendous
trinity
again
and
again
such
thoughts
assailed
her
duty
once
more
stirred
and
awoke
it
seemed
to
her
as
if
some
great
engine
ordained
of
heaven
to
run
its
appointed
course
had
come
to
a
standstill
was
rusting
to
its
ruin
and
that
she
alone
of
all
the
world
had
power
to
grasp
its
lever
to
send
it
on
its
way
whither
she
did
not
know
why
she
could
not
tell
she
knew
only
that
it
was
right
that
she
should
act
by
degrees
her
resolution
hardened
bennett
must
try
again
but
at
first
it
seemed
to
her
as
though
her
heart
would
break
and
more
than
once
she
wavered
as
bennett
continued
to
dictate
to
her
the
story
of
the
expedition
he
arrived
at
the
account
of
the
march
toward
kolyuchin
bay
and
finally
at
the
description
of
the
last
week
with
its
terrors
its
sufferings
its
starvation
its
despair
when
one
by
one
the
men
died
in
their
to
be
buried
under
slabs
of
ice
when
this
point
in
the
narrative
was
reached
bennett
inserted
no
comment
of
his
own
but
while
lloyd
wrote
read
simply
and
with
grim
directness
from
the
entries
in
his
journal
precisely
as
they
had
been
written
lloyd
had
known
in
a
vague
way
that
the
expedition
had
suffered
abominably
but
hitherto
bennett
had
never
consented
to
tell
her
the
story
in
detail
it
was
a
hard
week
he
informed
her
a
rather
bad
grind
now
for
the
first
time
she
was
to
know
just
what
had
happened
just
what
he
had
endured
as
usual
bennett
paced
the
floor
from
wall
to
wall
his
cigar
in
his
teeth
his
tattered
grimy
in
his
hand
at
the
desk
round
bare
arm
the
sleeve
turned
up
to
the
elbow
moved
evenly
back
and
forth
as
she
wrote
in
the
intervals
of
bennett
dictation
the
scratching
of
lloyd
pen
made
itself
heard
a
little
fire
snapped
and
crackled
on
the
hearth
the
morning
sun
came
flooding
in
at
the
windows
gale
of
wind
from
the
northeast
prompted
lloyd
raising
her
head
from
her
writing
bennett
continued
impossible
to
march
against
it
in
our
weakened
condition
he
paused
for
her
to
complete
the
sentence
must
camp
here
till
it
abates
have
you
got
that
lloyd
nodded
made
soup
of
the
last
of
the
this
afternoon
our
last
pemmican
gone
there
was
a
pause
then
bennett
resumed
december
wednesday
everybody
getting
weaker
metz
breaking
down
sent
adler
to
the
shore
to
gather
shrimps
we
had
about
a
mouthful
apiece
at
noon
supper
a
spoonful
of
glycerine
and
hot
water
lloyd
put
her
hand
to
her
temple
smoothing
back
her
hair
her
face
turned
away
as
before
in
the
park
on
that
warm
and
glowing
summer
afternoon
a
swift
clear
vision
of
the
ice
was
vouchsafed
to
her
she
saw
the
coast
of
kolyuchin
bay
primordial
desolation
whirling
snow
the
unleashed
wind
yelling
like
a
sabbath
of
witches
leaping
and
somersaulting
from
rock
to
rock
and
insensate
in
its
hideous
dance
of
death
bennett
continued
his
voice
insensibly
lowered
itself
a
certain
gravity
of
manner
came
upon
him
at
times
he
looked
at
the
written
pages
in
his
hand
with
vague
unseeing
eyes
no
doubt
he
too
was
remembering
he
resumed
december
thursday
metz
died
during
the
night
hansen
dying
still
blowing
a
gale
from
the
northeast
a
hard
night
lloyd
pen
moved
slower
and
slower
as
she
wrote
the
lines
of
the
manuscript
began
to
blur
and
swim
before
her
eyes
and
it
was
to
this
that
she
must
send
him
to
this
inhuman
horrible
region
to
this
life
of
prolonged
suffering
where
death
came
slowly
through
days
of
starvation
exhaustion
and
agony
hourly
renewed
he
must
dare
it
all
again
she
must
force
him
to
it
her
decision
had
been
taken
her
duty
was
plain
to
her
now
it
was
irrevocable
hansen
died
during
early
morning
dennison
breaking
down
december
sunday
dennison
found
dead
this
morning
between
adler
and
myself
the
vision
became
plainer
more
distinct
she
fancied
she
saw
the
interior
of
the
tent
and
the
dwindling
number
of
the
freja
survivors
moving
about
on
their
hands
and
knees
in
its
gloomy
their
hair
and
beards
were
long
their
faces
black
with
dirt
monstrously
distended
and
fat
with
the
bloated
irony
of
starvation
they
were
no
longer
men
after
that
unspeakable
stress
of
misery
nothing
but
the
animal
remained
too
weak
to
bury
him
or
even
carry
him
out
of
the
tent
he
must
lie
where
he
is
last
spoonful
of
glycerine
and
hot
water
divine
service
at
once
more
lloyd
faltered
in
her
writing
her
hand
moved
slower
shut
her
teeth
though
she
might
the
sobs
would
come
swiftly
the
tears
brimmed
her
eyes
but
she
tried
to
wink
them
back
lest
bennett
should
see
heroically
she
wrote
to
the
end
of
the
sentence
a
pause
followed
yes
divine
services
at
i
i
the
pen
dropped
from
her
fingers
and
she
sank
down
upon
her
desk
her
head
bowed
in
the
hollow
of
her
bare
arm
shaken
from
head
to
foot
with
the
violence
of
the
crudest
grief
she
had
ever
known
bennett
threw
his
journal
from
him
and
came
to
her
taking
her
in
his
arms
putting
her
head
upon
his
shoulder
why
lloyd
what
is
it
why
old
chap
what
the
devil
i
was
a
beast
to
read
that
to
you
it
was
really
as
bad
as
that
you
know
and
besides
look
here
look
at
me
it
all
happened
three
years
ago
all
over
with
now
without
raising
her
head
and
clinging
to
him
all
the
closer
lloyd
answered
brokenly
no
no
it
not
all
over
it
never
never
will
be
pshaw
nonsense
bennett
blustered
you
must
not
take
it
to
heart
like
this
we
going
to
forget
all
about
it
now
here
damn
the
book
anyhow
we
had
enough
of
it
put
your
hat
on
we
have
the
ponies
out
and
drive
somewhere
and
we
go
into
town
and
see
a
show
at
a
theatre
no
protested
lloyd
pushing
back
from
him
drying
her
eyes
you
shall
not
think
i
so
weak
we
will
go
on
with
what
we
have
to
do
with
our
work
i
all
right
now
bennett
marched
her
out
of
the
room
without
more
ado
and
following
her
closed
and
locked
the
door
behind
them
we
not
write
another
word
of
that
stuff
get
your
hat
and
things
i
going
out
to
tell
lewis
to
put
the
ponies
in
but
that
day
marked
a
beginning
from
that
time
on
lloyd
never
faltered
and
if
there
were
moments
when
the
iron
bit
deeper
than
usual
into
her
heart
bennett
never
knew
her
pain
by
degrees
a
course
of
action
planned
itself
for
her
a
direct
appeal
to
bennett
she
believed
would
not
only
be
useless
but
beyond
even
her
heroic
courage
she
must
influence
him
indirectly
the
initiative
must
appear
to
come
from
him
it
must
seem
to
him
that
he
of
his
own
accord
roused
his
dormant
resolution
it
was
a
situation
that
called
for
all
her
feminine
tact
all
her
delicacy
all
her
instinctive
diplomacy
the
round
of
their
daily
life
was
renewed
but
now
there
was
a
change
it
was
subtle
illusive
a
vague
indefinite
trouble
in
the
air
lloyd
had
addressed
herself
to
her
task
and
from
day
to
day
from
hour
to
hour
she
held
to
it
unseen
unnoticed
now
it
was
a
remark
dropped
as
if
by
chance
in
the
course
of
conversation
now
an
extract
cut
from
a
newspaper
or
scientific
journal
and
left
where
bennett
would
find
it
now
merely
a
look
in
her
eyes
an
instant
significant
glance
when
her
gaze
met
her
husband
or
a
moment
enthusiasm
over
the
news
of
some
discovery
insensibly
and
with
infinite
caution
she
directed
his
attention
to
the
world
he
believed
he
had
abjured
she
called
into
being
his
interest
in
his
own
field
of
action
reading
to
him
by
the
hour
from
the
writings
of
other
men
or
advancing
and
championing
theories
which
she
knew
to
be
false
and
ridiculous
but
which
she
goaded
him
to
deny
and
refute
one
morning
she
even
feigned
an
exclamation
of
unbounded
astonishment
as
she
opened
the
newspaper
while
the
two
were
at
breakfast
pretending
to
read
from
imaginary
headlines
ward
listen
pole
at
last
a
norwegian
expedition
solves
the
mystery
of
the
arctic
the
goal
reached
after
what
cried
bennett
sharply
his
frown
after
centuries
of
failure
lloyd
put
down
the
paper
with
a
note
of
laughter
suppose
you
should
read
it
some
day
bennett
subsided
with
a
growl
you
did
scare
me
for
a
moment
i
thought
i
thought
i
did
scare
you
why
were
you
scared
what
did
you
think
she
leaned
toward
him
eagerly
i
thought
well
oh
that
some
other
chap
duane
perhaps
he
still
at
tasiusak
but
he
will
succeed
i
do
believe
i
read
a
great
deal
about
him
he
has
energy
and
determination
if
anybody
succeeds
it
will
be
duane
he
never
somebody
then
you
said
once
that
if
your
husband
could
nobody
could
yes
yes
i
know
she
answered
cheerfully
but
you
you
are
out
of
it
now
huh
he
grumbled
it
not
because
i
do
think
i
could
if
i
wanted
to
no
you
could
not
ward
nobody
can
but
you
just
said
you
thought
somebody
would
some
day
did
i
oh
suppose
you
really
should
one
of
these
days
and
suppose
i
never
came
back
nonsense
of
course
you
would
come
back
they
all
do
nowadays
de
long
did
but
you
are
not
de
long
and
for
the
rest
of
the
day
lloyd
noted
with
a
sinking
heart
that
bennett
was
unusually
thoughtful
and
preoccupied
she
said
nothing
and
was
studious
to
avoid
breaking
in
upon
his
reflections
whatever
they
might
be
she
kept
out
of
his
way
as
much
as
possible
but
left
upon
his
desk
as
if
by
accident
a
copy
of
a
pamphlet
issued
by
a
geographical
society
open
at
an
article
upon
the
future
of
exploration
within
the
arctic
circle
at
supper
that
night
bennett
suddenly
broke
in
upon
a
rather
prolonged
silence
with
it
all
in
the
ship
build
a
ship
strong
enough
to
withstand
lateral
pressure
of
the
ice
and
the
whole
thing
becomes
easy
lloyd
yawned
and
stirred
her
tea
indifferently
as
she
answered
yes
but
you
know
that
ca
be
done
bennett
frowned
thoughtfully
drumming
upon
the
table
i
wager
could
build
one
but
it
not
the
ship
alone
it
the
man
whom
would
you
get
to
command
your
ship
bennett
stared
why
i
would
take
her
of
course
you
you
have
had
your
share
your
chance
now
you
can
afford
to
stay
home
and
finish
your
book
and
well
you
might
deliver
lectures
what
rot
lloyd
can
you
see
me
posing
on
a
lecture
platform
i
would
rather
see
you
doing
that
than
trying
to
beat
duane
than
getting
into
the
ice
again
i
would
rather
see
you
doing
that
than
to
know
that
you
were
away
up
there
in
the
north
in
the
ice
at
your
work
again
fighting
your
way
toward
the
pole
leading
your
men
and
overcoming
every
obstacle
that
stood
in
your
way
never
giving
up
never
losing
heart
trying
to
do
the
great
splendid
impossible
thing
risking
your
life
to
reach
merely
a
point
on
a
chart
yes
i
would
rather
see
you
on
a
lecture
platform
than
on
the
deck
of
an
arctic
steamship
you
know
that
ward
he
shot
a
glance
at
her
i
would
like
to
know
what
you
mean
he
muttered
the
winter
went
by
then
the
spring
and
by
june
all
the
country
around
medford
was
royal
with
summer
during
the
last
days
of
may
bennett
practically
had
completed
the
body
of
his
book
and
now
occupied
himself
with
its
appendix
there
was
little
variation
in
their
daily
life
adler
became
more
and
more
of
a
fixture
about
the
place
in
the
first
week
of
june
lloyd
and
bennett
had
a
visitor
a
guest
this
was
hattie
campbell
campbell
was
away
upon
a
business
trip
and
lloyd
had
arranged
to
have
the
little
girl
spend
the
fortnight
of
his
absence
with
her
at
medford
the
summer
was
delightful
a
vast
pervading
warmth
lay
close
over
all
the
world
the
trees
the
orchards
the
in
the
garden
about
the
house
all
the
teeming
life
of
trees
and
plants
hung
motionless
and
poised
in
the
still
tideless
ocean
of
the
air
it
was
very
quiet
all
distant
noises
the
crowing
of
cocks
the
persistent
calling
of
robins
and
jays
the
sound
of
wheels
upon
the
road
the
rumble
of
the
trains
passing
the
station
down
in
the
town
seemed
muffled
and
subdued
the
long
calm
summer
days
succeeded
one
another
in
an
unbroken
glimmering
procession
from
dawn
to
twilight
one
heard
the
faint
innumerable
murmurs
of
the
summer
the
dull
bourdon
of
bees
in
the
rose
and
lilac
bushes
the
prolonged
strident
buzzing
of
the
harsh
dry
scrape
of
grasshoppers
the
stridulating
of
an
occasional
cricket
in
the
twilight
and
all
through
the
night
itself
the
frogs
shrilled
from
the
hedgerows
and
in
the
damp
north
corners
of
the
fields
while
from
the
direction
of
the
hills
toward
the
east
the
whippoorwills
called
incessantly
during
the
day
the
air
was
full
of
odours
distilled
as
it
were
by
the
heat
of
high
noon
the
sweet
smell
of
ripening
apples
the
fragrance
of
warm
sap
and
leaves
and
growing
grass
the
smell
of
cows
from
the
nearby
pastures
the
pungent
ammoniacal
suggestion
of
the
stable
back
of
the
house
and
the
odour
of
scorching
paint
blistering
on
the
southern
walls
july
was
very
hot
no
breath
of
wind
stirred
the
vast
invisible
sea
of
air
quivering
and
oily
under
the
vertical
sun
the
landscape
was
deserted
of
animated
life
there
was
little
stirring
abroad
in
the
house
one
kept
within
the
cool
darkened
rooms
with
matting
on
the
floors
and
comfortable
deep
wicker
chairs
the
windows
wide
to
the
least
stirring
of
the
breeze
adler
dozed
in
his
canvas
hammock
slung
between
a
and
a
tree
in
the
shade
behind
the
stable
kamiska
sprawled
at
full
length
underneath
the
her
tongue
lolling
panting
incessantly
an
immeasurable
sunday
stillness
seemed
to
hang
suspended
in
the
atmosphere
a
drowsy
numbing
hush
there
was
no
thought
of
the
passing
of
time
the
day
of
the
week
was
always
a
matter
of
conjecture
it
seemed
as
though
this
life
of
heat
and
quiet
and
unbroken
silence
was
to
last
forever
then
suddenly
there
was
an
one
morning
a
day
or
so
after
hattie
campbell
had
returned
to
the
city
just
as
lloyd
and
bennett
were
finishing
their
breakfast
in
the
now
heavily
awninged
they
were
surprised
to
see
adler
running
down
the
road
toward
the
house
kamiska
racing
on
ahead
barking
excitedly
adler
had
gone
into
the
town
for
the
mail
and
morning
paper
this
latter
he
held
wide
open
in
his
hand
and
as
soon
as
he
caught
sight
of
lloyd
and
bennett
waved
it
about
him
shouting
as
he
ran
lloyd
heart
began
to
beat
there
was
only
one
thing
that
could
excite
adler
to
this
degree
the
english
expedition
adler
had
news
of
it
it
was
in
the
paper
duane
had
succeeded
had
been
working
steadily
northward
during
all
these
past
months
while
bennett
stuck
in
the
ice
stuck
in
the
ice
shouted
adler
as
he
swung
wide
the
front
gate
and
came
hastening
toward
the
veranda
across
the
lawn
what
did
we
say
hooray
he
stuck
i
knew
it
any
galoot
might
known
it
duane
stuck
a
wedge
off
bache
island
in
kane
basin
here
it
all
is
read
it
for
yourself
bennett
took
the
paper
from
him
and
read
aloud
to
the
effect
that
the
curlew
accompanied
by
her
collier
which
was
to
follow
her
to
the
southerly
limit
of
kane
basin
had
attempted
the
passage
of
smith
sound
late
in
june
but
the
season
as
had
been
feared
was
late
the
enormous
quantities
of
ice
reported
by
the
whalers
the
previous
year
had
not
debouched
from
the
narrow
channel
and
on
the
last
day
of
june
the
curlew
had
found
her
further
progress
effectually
blocked
in
essaying
to
force
her
way
into
a
lead
the
ice
had
closed
in
behind
her
and
while
not
as
yet
nipped
the
vessel
was
immobilised
there
was
no
hope
that
she
would
advance
northward
until
the
following
summer
the
collier
which
had
not
been
beset
had
returned
to
tasiusak
with
the
news
of
the
failure
what
a
galoot
what
a
a
professor
exclaimed
adler
with
a
vast
disdain
him
loafing
at
tasiusak
waiting
for
open
water
when
the
alert
wintered
in
well
he
shelved
for
another
year
anyhow
later
on
after
breakfast
lloyd
and
bennett
shut
themselves
in
bennett
workroom
and
for
upward
of
three
hours
addressed
themselves
to
the
unfinished
work
of
the
previous
day
compiling
from
notes
a
table
of
temperatures
of
the
taken
at
different
soundings
alternating
with
the
scratching
of
lloyd
pen
voice
continued
monotonously
august
meters
or
fathoms
minus
degrees
centigrade
or
fahrenheit
fahrenheit
repeated
lloyd
as
she
wrote
the
last
word
august
meters
or
fathoms
eight
hundred
and
fathoms
repeated
lloyd
as
bennett
paused
abstractedly
or
he
in
a
bad
way
you
know
what
do
you
mean
it
a
bad
bit
of
navigation
along
there
the
proteus
was
nipped
and
crushed
to
kindling
in
about
that
same
latitude
h
bennett
tugged
at
his
mustache
then
suddenly
as
if
coming
to
himself
well
these
temperatures
now
where
were
we
hundred
and
fathoms
minus
hundredths
degrees
centigrade
on
the
afternoon
of
the
next
day
just
as
they
were
finishing
this
table
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
it
was
adler
and
as
bennett
opened
the
door
he
saluted
and
handed
him
three
bennett
uttered
an
exclamation
of
surprise
and
lloyd
turned
about
from
the
desk
her
pen
poised
in
the
air
over
the
sheet
they
might
have
let
me
know
they
were
coming
she
heard
bennett
mutter
what
do
they
want
guess
they
came
on
that
noon
train
sir
hazarded
adler
they
say
what
they
wanted
just
inquired
for
you
who
is
it
asked
lloyd
coming
forward
bennett
read
off
the
names
on
the
cards
well
it
tremlidge
that
the
tremlidge
of
the
times
he
the
editor
and
proprietor
and
hamilton
garlock
has
something
to
do
with
that
new
geographical
society
president
i
believe
and
this
one
he
handed
her
the
third
card
is
a
friend
of
yours
craig
campbell
of
the
hercules
wrought
steel
company
lloyd
stared
what
can
they
want
she
murmured
looking
up
to
him
from
the
card
in
some
perplexity
bennett
shook
his
head
tell
them
to
come
up
here
he
said
to
adler
lloyd
hastily
drew
down
her
sleeve
over
her
bare
arm
why
up
here
ward
she
inquired
abruptly
should
we
have
seen
them
downstairs
he
demanded
with
a
frown
i
suppose
so
i
did
think
do
go
he
added
putting
a
hand
on
her
arm
as
she
started
for
the
door
you
might
as
well
hear
what
they
have
to
say
the
visitors
entered
adler
holding
open
the
door
campbell
well
groomed
and
gloved
even
in
that
warm
weather
tremlidge
the
editor
of
one
of
the
greater
daily
papers
of
the
city
and
of
the
country
for
the
matter
of
that
who
wore
a
monocle
and
carried
a
straw
hat
under
his
arm
and
garlock
the
of
an
international
geographical
society
an
old
man
with
beautiful
white
hair
curling
about
his
ears
a
great
bow
of
black
silk
knotted
about
his
collar
the
group
presented
all
unconsciously
three
great
and
highly
developed
phases
of
intelligence
science
manufactures
and
journalism
each
man
of
them
a
master
in
his
calling
when
the
introductions
and
preliminaries
were
over
bennett
took
up
his
position
again
in
front
of
the
fireplace
leaning
against
the
mantle
his
hands
in
his
pockets
lloyd
sat
opposite
to
him
at
the
desk
resting
her
elbow
on
the
edge
hanging
against
the
wall
behind
her
was
the
vast
chart
of
the
arctic
circle
tremlidge
the
editor
sat
on
the
bamboo
sofa
near
the
end
of
the
room
his
elbows
on
his
knees
gently
tapping
the
floor
with
the
ferrule
of
his
slim
garlock
the
scientist
had
dropped
into
the
depths
of
a
huge
leather
chair
and
leaned
back
in
it
comfortably
his
legs
crossed
one
boot
swinging
gently
campbell
stood
behind
this
chair
drumming
on
the
back
occasionally
with
the
fingers
of
one
hand
speaking
to
bennett
over
garlock
shoulder
and
from
time
to
time
turning
to
tremlidge
for
corroboration
and
support
of
what
he
was
saying
abruptly
the
conference
began
well
bennett
you
got
our
wire
campbell
said
by
way
of
commencement
bennett
shook
his
head
no
he
returned
in
some
surprise
no
i
got
no
wire
that
strange
said
tremlidge
i
wired
three
days
ago
asking
for
this
interview
the
address
was
right
i
think
i
wired
of
dr
pitts
is
that
right
that
probably
accounts
for
it
answered
bennett
this
is
house
but
he
does
not
live
here
now
your
despatch
no
doubt
went
to
his
office
in
the
city
and
was
forwarded
to
him
he
away
just
now
travelling
i
believe
but
you
here
that
the
essential
yes
murmured
garlock
looking
to
campbell
we
here
and
we
want
to
have
a
talk
with
you
campbell
who
had
evidently
been
chosen
spokesman
cleared
his
throat
well
bennett
i
do
know
just
how
to
begin
so
suppose
i
begin
at
the
beginning
tremlidge
and
i
belong
to
the
same
club
in
the
city
and
in
some
way
or
other
we
have
managed
to
see
a
good
deal
of
each
other
during
the
last
years
we
find
that
we
have
a
good
deal
in
common
i
do
think
his
editorial
columns
are
for
sale
and
he
does
believe
there
are
in
my
steel
plates
i
really
do
believe
we
have
certain
convictions
tremlidge
seems
to
have
an
idea
that
journalism
can
be
clean
and
yet
enterprising
and
tries
to
run
his
sheet
accordingly
and
i
am
afraid
that
i
would
not
make
a
bid
for
bridge
girders
below
what
it
would
cost
to
manufacture
them
honestly
tremlidge
and
i
differ
in
politics
we
hold
conflicting
views
as
to
municipal
government
we
attend
different
churches
we
are
at
variance
in
the
matter
of
public
education
of
the
tariff
of
emigration
and
heaven
save
the
mark
of
capital
and
labour
but
we
tell
ourselves
that
we
are
and
are
a
little
proud
that
god
allowed
us
to
be
born
in
the
united
states
also
it
appears
that
we
have
more
money
than
henry
george
believes
to
be
right
now
continued
campbell
straightening
himself
as
though
he
were
about
to
touch
upon
the
real
subject
of
his
talk
when
the
news
of
your
return
bennett
was
received
it
was
as
of
course
you
understand
the
one
topic
of
conversation
in
the
streets
the
clubs
the
newspaper
offices
everywhere
tremlidge
and
i
met
at
our
club
at
luncheon
the
next
week
and
i
remember
perfectly
well
how
long
and
how
very
earnestly
we
talked
of
your
work
and
of
arctic
exploration
in
general
we
found
out
all
of
a
sudden
that
here
at
last
was
a
subject
we
were
agreed
upon
a
subject
in
which
we
took
an
extraordinary
mutual
interest
we
discovered
that
we
had
read
almost
every
explorer
book
from
sir
john
franklin
down
we
knew
all
about
the
different
theories
and
plans
of
reaching
the
pole
we
knew
how
and
why
they
had
all
failed
but
for
all
that
we
were
both
of
the
opinion
campbell
leaned
forward
speaking
with
considerable
energy
that
it
can
be
done
and
that
america
ought
to
do
it
that
would
be
something
better
than
even
a
world
fair
we
give
out
a
good
deal
of
money
tremlidge
and
i
every
year
to
public
works
and
one
thing
or
another
we
buy
pictures
by
american
artists
pictures
that
we
do
want
we
found
a
scholarship
now
and
then
we
contribute
money
to
build
groups
of
statuary
in
the
park
we
give
checks
to
the
finance
committees
of
libraries
and
museums
and
all
the
rest
of
it
but
for
the
lives
of
us
we
can
feel
only
a
mild
interest
in
the
pictures
and
statues
and
museums
and
colleges
though
we
go
on
buying
the
one
and
supporting
the
other
because
we
think
that
somehow
it
is
right
for
us
to
do
it
i
afraid
we
are
men
more
of
action
than
of
art
literature
and
the
like
tremlidge
is
i
know
he
wants
facts
accomplished
results
when
he
gives
out
his
money
he
wants
to
see
the
concrete
substantial
return
and
i
not
sure
that
i
am
not
of
the
same
way
of
thinking
well
with
this
and
with
that
and
after
talking
it
all
over
a
dozen
times
twenty
times
we
came
to
the
conclusion
that
what
we
would
most
like
to
aid
financially
would
be
a
successful
attempt
by
an
ship
manned
by
american
seamen
led
by
an
american
commander
to
reach
the
north
pole
we
came
to
be
very
enthusiastic
about
our
idea
but
we
want
it
american
from
start
to
finish
we
will
start
the
subscription
and
want
to
head
the
list
with
our
checks
but
we
want
every
bolt
in
that
ship
forged
in
american
foundries
from
metal
dug
out
of
american
soil
we
want
every
plank
in
her
hull
shaped
from
american
trees
every
sail
of
her
woven
by
american
looms
every
man
of
her
born
of
american
parents
and
we
want
it
this
way
because
we
believe
in
american
manufactures
because
we
believe
in
american
shipbuilding
because
we
believe
in
american
sailmakers
and
because
we
believe
in
the
intelligence
and
pluck
and
endurance
and
courage
of
the
american
sailor
well
campbell
continued
changing
his
position
and
speaking
in
a
quieter
voice
we
did
not
say
much
to
anybody
and
in
fact
we
never
really
planned
any
expedition
at
all
we
merely
talked
about
its
practical
nature
and
the
desirability
of
having
it
distinctively
american
this
was
all
last
summer
what
we
wanted
to
do
was
to
make
the
scheme
a
popular
one
it
would
not
be
hard
to
raise
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
from
among
a
dozen
or
so
men
whom
we
both
know
and
we
found
that
we
could
count
upon
the
financial
support
of
garlock
society
that
was
all
very
well
but
we
wanted
the
to
back
this
enterprise
we
would
rather
get
a
thousand
subscriptions
than
five
of
a
thousand
dollars
each
when
our
ship
went
out
we
wanted
her
commander
to
feel
not
that
there
were
merely
a
few
millionaires
who
had
paid
for
his
equipment
and
his
vessel
behind
him
but
that
he
had
seventy
millions
of
people
a
whole
nation
at
his
back
so
tremlidge
went
to
work
and
telegraphed
instructions
to
the
washington
correspondents
of
his
paper
to
sound
quietly
the
temper
of
as
many
congressmen
as
possible
in
the
matter
of
making
an
appropriation
toward
such
an
expedition
it
was
not
so
much
the
money
we
wanted
as
the
sanction
of
the
united
states
anything
that
has
to
do
with
the
navy
is
popular
just
at
present
we
had
got
a
congressman
to
introduce
and
father
an
appropriation
bill
and
we
could
count
upon
the
support
of
enough
members
of
both
houses
to
put
it
through
we
wanted
congress
to
appropriate
twenty
thousand
dollars
we
hoped
to
raise
another
ten
thousand
dollars
by
popular
subscription
garlock
could
assure
us
two
thousand
dollars
tremlidge
would
contribute
twenty
thousand
dollars
in
the
name
of
the
times
and
i
pledged
myself
to
ten
thousand
dollars
and
promised
to
build
the
ship
engines
and
fittings
we
kept
our
intentions
to
ourselves
as
tremlidge
did
not
want
the
other
papers
to
get
hold
of
the
story
before
the
times
printed
it
but
we
continued
to
lay
our
wires
at
washington
everything
was
going
as
smooth
as
oil
we
seemed
sure
of
the
success
of
our
appropriation
bill
and
it
was
even
to
be
introduced
next
week
when
the
news
came
of
the
collapse
of
the
english
expedition
the
affair
you
would
have
expected
precisely
an
opposite
effect
but
it
has
knocked
our
chances
with
congress
into
a
cocked
hat
our
member
who
was
to
father
the
bill
declared
to
us
that
so
sure
as
it
was
brought
up
now
it
would
be
killed
in
committee
i
went
to
washington
at
once
it
was
this
and
not
as
you
supposed
private
business
that
has
taken
me
away
i
saw
our
member
and
tremlidge
head
correspondent
it
was
absolutely
no
use
these
men
who
have
their
finger
upon
the
congressional
pulse
were
all
of
the
same
opinion
it
would
be
useless
to
try
to
put
through
our
bill
at
present
our
member
said
all
tremlidge
men
said
wait
for
another
year
until
this
english
expedition
and
its
failure
are
forgotten
and
then
try
again
but
we
do
want
to
wait
suppose
duane
blocked
for
the
present
he
has
a
tremendous
start
he
on
the
ground
by
next
summer
the
chances
are
the
ice
will
have
so
broken
up
as
to
permit
him
to
push
ahead
and
by
the
time
our
bill
gets
through
and
our
ship
built
and
launched
he
may
be
heaven
knows
where
right
up
to
the
pole
perhaps
no
we
ca
afford
to
give
england
such
long
odds
we
want
to
lay
the
keel
of
our
ship
as
soon
as
we
can
next
week
if
possible
we
got
the
balance
of
the
summer
and
all
the
winter
to
prepare
in
and
a
year
from
this
month
we
want
our
american
expedition
to
be
inside
the
polar
circle
to
be
up
with
duane
and
at
least
to
break
even
with
england
if
we
can
do
that
we
not
afraid
of
the
result
provided
continued
campbell
provided
bennett
are
in
command
if
you
consent
to
make
the
attempt
only
one
point
remains
to
be
settled
congress
has
failed
us
we
will
give
up
the
idea
of
an
appropriation
now
then
and
this
is
particularly
what
we
want
to
consult
you
about
how
are
we
going
to
raise
the
twenty
thousand
dollars
lloyd
rose
to
her
feet
you
may
draw
on
me
for
the
amount
she
said
quietly
garlock
uncrossed
his
legs
and
sat
up
abruptly
in
the
chair
tremlidge
screwed
his
monocle
into
his
eye
and
stared
while
campbell
turned
about
sharply
at
the
sound
of
lloyd
voice
with
a
murmur
of
astonishment
bennett
alone
did
not
move
as
before
he
leaned
heavily
against
the
mantelpiece
his
hands
in
his
pockets
his
head
and
his
huge
shoulders
a
little
bent
only
from
under
his
thick
knotted
frown
he
shot
a
swift
glance
toward
his
wife
lloyd
paid
no
attention
to
the
others
after
that
one
quiet
movement
that
had
brought
her
to
her
feet
she
remained
motionless
and
erect
her
hands
hanging
straight
at
her
sides
the
colour
slowly
mounting
to
her
cheeks
she
met
glance
and
held
it
steadily
calmly
looking
straight
into
his
eyes
she
said
no
word
but
all
her
love
for
him
all
her
hopes
of
him
all
the
fine
strong
resolve
that
come
what
would
his
career
should
not
be
broken
his
ambition
should
not
faint
through
any
weakness
of
hers
all
her
eager
sympathy
for
his
great
work
all
her
strong
womanly
encouragement
for
him
to
accomplish
his
destiny
spoke
to
him
and
called
to
him
in
that
long
earnest
look
of
her
eyes
now
she
was
no
longer
weak
now
she
could
face
the
dreary
consequences
that
for
her
must
follow
the
rousing
of
his
dormant
energy
now
was
no
longer
the
time
for
indirect
appeal
the
screen
was
down
between
them
more
eloquent
than
any
spoken
words
was
the
calm
steady
gaze
in
which
she
held
his
own
there
was
a
long
silence
while
husband
and
wife
stood
looking
deep
into
each
other
eyes
and
then
as
a
certain
slow
kindling
took
place
in
his
look
lloyd
saw
that
at
last
bennett
after
that
the
conference
broke
up
rapidly
campbell
as
the
head
and
spokesman
of
the
committee
noted
the
long
significant
glance
that
had
passed
between
bennett
and
lloyd
and
perhaps
vaguely
divined
that
he
had
touched
upon
a
matter
of
a
particularly
delicate
and
intimate
nature
something
was
in
the
air
something
was
passing
between
husband
and
wife
in
which
the
outside
world
had
no
concern
something
not
meant
for
him
to
see
he
brought
the
interview
to
an
end
as
quickly
as
possible
he
begged
of
bennett
to
consider
this
talk
as
a
mere
preliminary
a
breaking
of
the
ground
he
would
give
bennett
time
to
think
it
over
speaking
for
himself
and
the
others
he
was
deeply
impressed
with
that
generous
offer
to
meet
the
unexpected
deficiency
but
it
had
been
made
upon
the
spur
of
the
moment
no
doubt
bennett
and
his
wife
would
wish
to
talk
it
over
between
themselves
to
consider
the
whole
matter
the
committee
temporarily
had
its
headquarters
in
his
campbell
offices
he
left
bennett
the
address
he
would
await
his
decision
and
answer
there
when
the
conference
ended
bennett
accompanied
the
members
of
the
committee
downstairs
and
to
the
front
door
of
the
house
the
three
had
with
thanks
and
excuses
declined
all
invitations
to
dine
at
medford
with
bennett
and
his
wife
they
could
conveniently
catch
the
next
train
back
to
the
city
campbell
and
tremlidge
were
in
a
hurry
to
return
to
their
respective
businesses
the
front
gate
closed
bennett
was
left
alone
he
shut
the
front
door
of
the
house
and
for
an
instant
stood
leaning
against
it
his
small
eyes
twinkling
under
his
frown
his
glance
straying
aimlessly
about
amid
the
familiar
objects
of
the
hallway
and
adjoining
rooms
he
was
thoughtful
perturbed
tugging
slowly
at
the
ends
of
his
mustache
slowly
he
ascended
the
stairs
gaining
the
landing
on
the
second
floor
and
going
on
toward
the
door
of
the
workroom
he
had
just
quitted
lloyd
was
uppermost
in
his
mind
he
wanted
her
his
wife
and
that
at
once
he
was
conscious
that
a
great
thing
had
suddenly
transpired
that
all
the
calm
and
infinitely
happy
life
of
the
last
year
was
ruthlessly
broken
up
but
in
his
mind
there
was
nothing
more
definite
nothing
stronger
than
the
thought
of
his
wife
and
the
desire
for
her
companionship
and
advice
he
came
into
the
workroom
closing
the
door
behind
him
with
his
heel
his
hands
deep
in
his
pockets
lloyd
was
still
there
standing
opposite
him
as
he
entered
she
hardly
seemed
to
have
moved
while
he
had
been
gone
they
did
not
immediately
speak
once
more
their
eyes
met
then
at
length
well
lloyd
well
my
husband
bennett
was
about
to
answer
what
he
hardly
knew
but
at
that
moment
there
was
a
diversion
the
old
boat
flag
the
tattered
little
square
of
faded
stars
and
bars
that
had
been
used
to
mark
the
line
of
many
a
weary
march
had
been
hanging
as
usual
over
the
plans
of
the
freja
on
the
wail
opposite
the
window
inadequately
fixed
in
its
place
the
jar
of
the
closing
door
as
bennett
shut
it
behind
him
dislodged
it
and
it
fell
to
the
floor
close
beside
him
he
stooped
and
picked
it
up
and
holding
it
in
his
hand
turned
toward
the
spot
whence
it
had
fallen
he
cast
a
glance
at
the
wall
above
the
plans
of
the
freja
about
to
replace
it
willing
for
the
instant
to
defer
the
momentous
words
he
felt
must
soon
be
spoken
willing
to
put
off
the
inevitable
a
few
seconds
longer
i
do
know
he
muttered
looking
from
the
flag
to
the
empty
about
the
room
i
do
know
just
where
to
put
this
do
you
do
you
know
interrupted
lloyd
suddenly
her
blue
eyes
all
alight
no
said
bennett
i
lloyd
caught
the
flag
from
his
hands
and
with
one
great
sweep
of
her
arm
drove
its
shaft
full
into
the
centre
of
the
great
chart
of
the
polar
region
into
the
innermost
concentric
circle
where
the
pole
was
marked
put
that
flag
there
she
cried
xi
that
particular
day
in
the
last
week
in
april
was
sombre
and
somewhat
chilly
but
there
was
little
wind
the
water
of
the
harbour
lay
smooth
as
a
sheet
of
tightly
stretched
gray
silk
overhead
the
drifted
gradually
landward
descending
as
it
drifted
till
the
outlines
of
the
city
grew
blurred
and
indistinct
resolving
to
a
dim
vast
mass
rugged
with
office
buildings
and
bulging
domes
confused
and
mysterious
under
the
cloak
of
the
fog
in
the
nearer
foreground
along
the
lines
of
the
wharves
and
docks
a
wilderness
of
masts
and
spars
of
a
tone
just
darker
than
the
gray
of
the
mist
stood
away
from
the
blur
of
the
background
with
the
distinctness
and
delicacy
of
but
amid
all
this
grayness
of
sky
and
water
and
fog
one
distinguished
certain
black
and
shifting
masses
they
outlined
every
wharf
they
banked
every
dock
every
quay
every
small
and
inconsequent
jetty
had
its
fringe
of
black
even
the
roofs
of
the
buildings
along
the
were
crested
with
the
same
mass
it
was
the
people
the
crowd
rank
upon
rank
expectant
thronging
there
upon
the
city
edge
swelling
in
size
with
the
lapse
of
every
minute
vast
conglomerate
restless
and
throwing
off
into
the
stillness
of
the
quiet
gray
air
a
prolonged
indefinite
murmur
a
monotonous
minor
note
the
surface
of
the
bay
was
dotted
over
with
all
manner
of
craft
black
with
people
rowboats
perilously
overcrowded
were
everywhere
ferryboats
and
excursion
steamers
chartered
for
that
day
heeled
over
almost
to
the
water
edge
with
the
unsteady
weight
of
their
passengers
tugboats
passed
up
and
down
similarly
crowded
and
displaying
the
flags
of
various
journals
and
news
organisations
the
news
the
press
the
times
and
the
associated
press
private
yachts
trim
and
very
graceful
and
gleaming
with
brass
and
varnish
slipped
by
with
scarcely
a
ripple
to
mark
their
progress
while
full
in
the
centre
of
the
bay
gigantic
solid
formidable
her
grim
silent
guns
thrusting
their
snouts
from
her
turrets
a
great
white
battleship
rode
motionless
to
her
anchor
an
hour
passed
noon
came
at
long
intervals
a
faint
seaward
breeze
compressed
the
fog
and
high
clouds
and
a
fine
and
penetrating
rain
came
drizzling
down
the
crowds
along
the
wharves
grew
denser
and
blacker
the
numbers
of
yachts
boats
and
steamers
increased
even
the
yards
and
masts
of
the
were
dotted
over
with
watchers
then
at
length
from
far
up
the
bay
there
came
a
faint
a
barely
perceptible
droning
sound
the
sound
of
distant
shouting
instantly
the
crowds
were
alert
and
a
quick
surging
movement
rippled
from
end
to
end
of
the
throng
along
the
its
subdued
murmur
rose
in
pitch
upon
the
second
like
a
flock
of
agitated
gulls
the
boats
in
the
harbour
stirred
nimbly
from
place
to
place
a
belated
newspaper
tug
tore
by
headed
for
the
upper
bay
smoking
fiercely
the
water
boiling
from
her
bows
from
the
battleship
came
the
tap
of
a
drum
the
excursion
steamers
and
chartered
ferryboats
moved
to
points
of
vantage
and
took
position
occasionally
feeling
the
water
with
their
paddles
the
distant
droning
sound
drew
gradually
nearer
swelling
in
volume
and
by
degrees
splitting
into
innumerable
component
parts
one
began
to
distinguish
the
various
notes
that
contributed
to
its
volume
a
sharp
quick
volley
of
inarticulate
shouts
or
a
cadenced
cheer
or
a
hoarse
salvo
of
steam
whistles
bells
began
to
ring
in
different
quarters
of
the
city
then
all
at
once
the
advancing
wave
of
sound
swept
down
like
the
rush
of
a
great
storm
a
roar
as
of
the
unchained
wind
leaped
upward
from
those
banked
and
crowding
masses
it
swelled
louder
and
louder
deafening
inarticulate
a
vast
bellow
of
exultation
split
the
gray
heavens
erect
plumes
of
steam
shot
upward
from
the
ferry
and
excursion
boats
but
the
noise
of
their
whistles
was
lost
and
drowned
in
the
reverberation
of
that
mighty
and
prolonged
clamour
but
suddenly
the
indeterminate
thunder
was
pierced
and
dominated
by
a
sharp
and
report
and
a
jet
of
white
smoke
shot
out
from
the
flanks
of
the
battleship
her
guns
had
spoken
instantly
and
from
another
quarter
of
her
hull
came
another
jet
of
white
smoke
stabbed
through
with
its
thin
yellow
flash
and
another
abrupt
clap
of
thunder
shook
the
windows
of
the
city
the
boats
that
all
the
morning
had
been
moving
toward
the
upper
bay
were
returning
they
came
slowly
a
veritable
fleet
steaming
down
the
bay
headed
for
the
open
sea
beyond
the
entrance
of
the
harbour
each
crowded
and
careening
to
the
very
gunwales
each
whistling
with
might
and
main
and
in
their
midst
the
round
which
this
tempest
of
acclamation
surged
the
object
on
which
so
many
eyes
were
focussed
the
hope
of
an
entire
nation
one
ship
she
was
small
and
seemingly
pitifully
inadequate
for
the
great
adventure
on
which
she
was
bound
her
lines
were
short
and
ungraceful
from
her
clumsy
bow
to
her
high
round
stern
from
her
bulging
sides
to
the
summit
of
her
short
powerful
masts
there
was
scant
beauty
in
her
she
was
broad
blunt
evidently
slow
in
her
movements
and
in
the
smooth
waters
of
the
bay
seemed
out
of
her
element
but
for
all
that
she
imparted
an
impression
of
compactness
the
compactness
of
things
dwarfed
and
stunted
vast
indeed
would
be
the
force
that
would
crush
those
bulging
flanks
so
cunningly
built
moreover
that
the
ship
must
slip
and
rise
to
any
too
great
lateral
pressure
far
above
her
waist
rose
her
smokestack
overhead
upon
the
mainmast
was
affixed
the
crow
nest
whaleboats
and
cutters
swung
from
her
davits
while
all
her
decks
were
cumbered
with
barrels
with
crates
with
boxes
and
strangely
shaped
bales
and
cases
she
drew
nearer
continuing
that
slow
proud
progress
down
the
bay
honoured
as
no
visiting
sovereign
had
ever
been
the
great
white
dressed
ship
as
she
passed
and
the
ensign
at
her
dipped
and
rose
again
at
once
there
was
a
movement
aboard
the
little
outbound
ship
one
of
her
crew
ran
aft
and
hauled
sharply
at
the
halyards
and
then
at
her
peak
there
was
broken
out
not
the
brilliant
banner
gay
and
brave
and
clean
but
a
little
length
of
bunting
tattered
and
soiled
a
faded
breadth
of
stars
and
bars
a
veritable
eloquent
of
strenuous
endeavour
of
fighting
without
quarter
and
of
hardship
borne
without
flinching
and
without
complaining
the
ship
with
her
crowding
escorts
held
onward
by
degrees
the
city
was
passed
the
bay
narrowed
oceanwards
little
by
little
the
throng
of
people
the
boom
of
cannon
and
the
noise
of
shouting
dropped
astern
one
by
one
the
boats
of
the
escorting
squadron
halted
drew
off
and
turning
with
a
parting
blast
of
their
whistles
headed
back
to
the
city
only
the
larger
heavier
steamers
and
the
tugs
still
kept
on
their
way
on
either
shore
of
the
bay
the
houses
began
to
dwindle
giving
place
to
open
fields
brown
and
sear
under
the
scudding
for
now
a
wind
was
building
up
from
out
the
east
and
the
surface
of
the
bay
had
begun
to
ruffle
half
a
mile
farther
on
the
slow
huge
groundswells
began
to
come
in
a
lighthouse
was
passed
full
in
view
on
ahead
stretched
the
open
empty
waste
of
ocean
another
steamer
turned
back
then
another
then
another
then
the
last
of
the
newspaper
tugs
the
fleet
reduced
now
to
half
a
dozen
craft
ploughed
on
through
and
over
the
groundswells
the
ship
they
were
escorting
leading
the
way
her
ragged
little
ensign
straining
stiff
in
the
ocean
wind
at
the
entrance
of
the
bay
where
the
enclosing
shores
drew
together
and
trailed
off
to
three
more
of
the
escort
halted
and
unwilling
to
face
the
tumbling
expanse
of
the
ocean
bleak
and
gray
turned
homeward
then
just
beyond
the
bar
two
more
of
the
remaining
boats
fell
off
and
headed
cityward
a
third
immediately
did
likewise
the
outbound
ship
was
left
with
only
one
companion
but
that
one
a
sturdy
little
tug
held
close
close
to
the
flank
of
the
departing
vessel
keeping
even
pace
with
her
and
lying
alongside
as
nearly
as
she
dared
for
the
fog
had
begun
to
thicken
and
distant
objects
were
shut
from
sight
by
occasional
drifting
patches
on
board
the
tug
there
was
but
one
passenger
a
woman
she
stood
upon
the
forward
deck
holding
to
a
stanchion
with
one
strong
white
hand
the
strands
of
her
hair
whipping
across
her
face
the
salt
spray
damp
upon
her
cheeks
she
was
dressed
in
a
long
brown
ulster
its
cape
flying
from
her
shoulders
as
the
wind
lifted
it
small
as
was
the
outgoing
ship
the
tug
was
still
smaller
and
its
single
passenger
had
to
raise
her
eyes
above
her
to
see
the
figure
of
a
man
upon
the
bridge
of
the
ship
a
tall
heavily
built
figure
buttoned
from
heel
to
chin
in
a
greatcoat
who
stood
there
gripping
the
rail
of
the
bridge
with
one
hand
and
from
time
to
time
giving
an
order
to
his
who
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
bridge
before
the
compass
and
electric
indicator
between
the
man
upon
the
bridge
and
the
woman
on
the
forward
deck
of
the
tug
there
was
from
time
to
time
a
little
conversation
they
called
to
one
another
above
the
throbbing
of
the
engines
and
the
wash
of
the
sea
alongside
and
in
the
sound
of
their
voices
there
was
a
note
of
attempted
cheerfulness
practically
they
were
alone
with
the
exception
of
the
on
the
bridge
the
crew
of
the
ship
were
nowhere
in
sight
on
the
tug
no
one
but
the
woman
was
to
be
seen
all
around
them
stretched
the
sea
then
at
last
in
answer
to
a
question
from
the
man
on
the
bridge
the
woman
said
yes
i
think
i
had
better
an
order
was
given
the
tug
bell
rang
in
her
and
the
engine
slowed
and
stopped
for
some
time
the
tug
continued
her
headway
ranging
alongside
the
ship
as
before
then
she
began
to
fall
behind
at
first
slowly
then
with
increasing
swiftness
the
outbound
ship
continued
on
her
way
and
between
the
two
the
water
widened
and
widened
but
the
fog
was
thick
in
another
moment
the
two
would
be
shut
out
from
each
other
sight
the
moment
of
separation
was
come
then
lloyd
standing
alone
on
that
heaving
deck
drew
herself
up
to
her
full
height
her
head
a
little
back
her
blue
eyes
all
alight
a
smile
upon
her
lips
she
spoke
no
word
she
made
no
gesture
but
stood
there
the
smile
yet
upon
her
lips
erect
firm
motionless
looking
steadily
calmly
proudly
into
bennett
eyes
as
his
ship
carried
him
farther
and
farther
away
suddenly
the
fog
shut
down
the
two
vessels
were
shut
from
each
sight
as
bennett
stood
leaning
upon
the
rail
of
the
bridge
behind
him
his
hands
deep
in
the
pockets
of
his
greatcoat
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
visible
strip
of
water
just
ahead
of
his
ship
prow
the
adler
approached
and
saluted
beg
pardon
sir
he
said
we
just
clear
of
the
last
buoy
our
course
now
sir
bennett
glanced
at
the
chart
that
adler
held
and
then
at
the
compass
affixed
to
the
rail
of
the
bridge
close
at
hand
quietly
he
answered
due
north
