the
delicious
intangible
joke
good
enough
he
chuckled
every
girl
like
cornelia
had
to
go
south
sometime
between
november
and
march
an
elderly
dame
a
appeared
dragging
an
exceedingly
obstreperous
well
i
be
hanged
growled
stanton
if
i
going
to
be
strung
by
any
boy
some
poor
old
maybe
she
is
he
volunteered
at
last
oh
do
i
look
gorgeous
she
stammered
what
cried
stanton
plunging
forward
in
his
chair
cornelia
mother
answered
this
time
he
unbuckled
the
straps
of
his
suitcase
and
turned
the
cover
backward
on
the
floor
are
you
a
good
boy
she
asked
it
only
carl
he
said
molly
i
the
morning
was
as
dark
and
cold
as
city
snow
could
make
it
a
dingy
whirl
at
the
window
a
smoky
gust
through
the
fireplace
a
shadow
black
as
a
bear
cave
under
the
table
nothing
in
all
the
cavernous
room
loomed
really
warm
or
familiar
except
a
glass
of
stale
water
and
a
vapid
packed
into
his
pudgy
pillows
like
a
fragile
piece
of
china
instead
of
a
human
being
carl
stanton
lay
and
cursed
the
brutal
northern
winter
between
his
sturdy
restive
shoulders
the
rheumatism
snarled
and
clawed
like
some
utterly
frenzied
animal
trying
to
its
way
out
along
the
tortured
hollow
of
his
back
a
plaster
fumed
and
mulled
and
sucked
at
the
pain
like
a
hideously
poisoned
fang
trying
to
its
way
in
worse
than
this
every
four
or
five
minutes
an
agony
as
miserably
comic
as
a
crashing
blow
on
crazy
bone
went
jarring
and
shuddering
through
his
whole
abnormally
vibrant
system
in
stanton
swollen
fingers
cornelia
large
crisp
letter
rustled
not
softly
like
a
lady
skirts
but
bleakly
as
an
in
december
woods
cornelia
whole
angular
handwriting
in
fact
was
not
at
all
unlike
a
thicket
of
twigs
stripped
from
root
to
branch
of
every
possible
softening
leaf
dear
carl
crackled
the
letter
in
spite
of
your
unpleasant
tantrum
yesterday
because
i
would
not
kiss
you
in
the
presence
of
my
mother
i
am
enough
you
see
to
write
you
a
letter
after
all
but
i
certainly
will
not
promise
to
write
you
daily
so
kindly
do
not
tease
me
any
more
about
it
in
the
first
place
you
understand
that
i
greatly
dislike
in
the
second
place
you
know
jacksonville
quite
as
well
as
i
do
so
there
is
no
use
whatsoever
in
wasting
either
my
time
or
yours
in
purely
geographical
descriptions
and
in
the
third
place
you
ought
to
be
bright
enough
to
comprehend
by
this
time
just
what
i
think
about
anyway
i
have
told
you
once
that
i
love
you
and
that
ought
to
be
enough
people
like
myself
do
not
change
i
may
not
talk
quite
as
much
as
other
people
but
when
i
once
say
a
thing
i
mean
it
you
will
never
have
cause
i
assure
you
to
worry
about
my
fidelity
i
will
honestly
try
to
write
you
every
sunday
these
next
six
weeks
but
i
am
not
willing
to
literally
promise
even
that
mother
indeed
thinks
that
we
ought
not
to
write
very
much
at
all
until
our
engagement
is
formally
announced
trusting
that
your
rheumatism
is
very
much
better
this
morning
i
am
hastily
yours
cornelia
apropos
of
your
sentimental
passion
for
letters
i
enclose
a
ridiculous
circular
which
was
handed
to
me
yesterday
at
the
woman
exchange
you
had
better
investigate
it
it
seems
to
be
rather
your
kind
as
the
letter
fluttered
out
of
his
hand
stanton
closed
his
eyes
with
a
twitch
of
physical
suffering
then
he
picked
up
the
letter
again
and
scrutinized
it
very
carefully
from
the
severe
silver
monogram
to
the
huge
gothic
signature
but
he
could
not
find
one
single
thing
that
he
was
looking
for
not
a
nourishing
paragraph
not
a
stimulating
sentence
not
even
so
much
as
one
small
word
that
was
worth
filching
out
of
the
prosy
text
to
tuck
away
in
the
pockets
of
his
mind
for
his
memory
to
munch
on
in
its
hungry
hours
now
everybody
who
knows
anything
at
all
knows
perfectly
well
that
even
a
business
letter
does
not
deserve
the
paper
which
it
is
written
on
unless
it
contains
at
least
one
significant
phrase
that
is
worth
waking
up
in
the
night
to
remember
and
think
about
and
as
to
the
lover
who
does
not
write
significant
phrases
heaven
help
the
young
mate
who
finds
himself
thus
mismated
to
so
spiritually
commonplace
a
nature
baffled
perplexed
strangely
uneasy
stanton
lay
and
studied
the
barren
page
before
him
then
suddenly
his
poor
heart
puckered
up
like
a
persimmon
with
the
ghastly
grim
shock
which
a
man
experiences
when
he
realizes
for
the
first
time
that
the
woman
whom
he
loves
is
not
shy
but
with
snow
and
gloom
and
pain
and
loneliness
the
rest
of
the
day
dragged
by
hour
after
hour
helpless
hopeless
utterly
impotent
as
though
time
itself
were
bleeding
to
death
the
minutes
bubbled
and
dripped
from
the
old
wooden
clock
by
noon
the
room
was
as
murky
as
and
stanton
lay
and
fretted
in
the
messy
sudsy
like
a
forgotten
knife
or
spoon
until
the
janitor
wandered
casually
in
about
three
and
wrung
a
piercing
little
wisp
of
flame
out
of
the
bulb
over
the
sick
man
head
and
raised
him
clumsily
out
of
his
soggy
pillows
and
fed
him
indolently
with
a
sad
thin
soup
worst
of
all
four
times
in
the
dreadful
interim
between
breakfast
and
supper
the
postman
thrilly
footsteps
soared
up
the
long
metallic
stairway
like
an
ecstatically
towering
only
to
flat
off
discordantly
at
stanton
door
without
even
so
much
as
a
advertisement
issuing
from
the
and
there
would
be
thirty
or
forty
more
days
just
like
this
the
doctor
had
assured
him
and
cornelia
had
said
that
perhaps
if
she
felt
like
it
she
would
write
six
times
then
night
came
down
like
the
feathery
soot
of
a
smoky
lamp
and
smutted
first
the
bedquilt
then
the
then
the
and
then
at
last
the
great
stormy
faraway
outside
world
but
sleep
did
not
come
oh
no
nothing
new
came
at
all
except
that
particularly
wretched
itching
type
of
insomnia
which
seems
to
rip
away
from
one
body
the
whole
kind
protecting
skin
and
expose
all
the
raw
ticklish
fretwork
of
nerves
to
the
mercy
of
a
gritty
blanket
or
a
wrinkled
sheet
pain
came
too
in
its
most
brutally
high
and
sweat
like
the
smother
of
furs
in
summer
and
thirst
like
the
scrape
of
hot
and
chill
like
the
clammy
horror
of
raw
fish
then
just
as
the
mawkish
cold
gray
dawn
came
nosing
over
the
and
the
poor
fellow
mind
had
reached
the
point
where
the
slam
of
a
window
or
the
ripping
creak
of
a
floorboard
would
have
shattered
his
brittle
nerves
into
a
thousand
cursing
tortures
then
that
teasing
tantalizing
little
friend
of
all
rheumatic
invalids
the
morning
nap
came
swooping
down
upon
him
like
a
sponge
and
wiped
out
of
his
face
every
single
bit
of
the
sharp
precious
evidence
of
pain
which
he
had
been
accumulating
so
laboriously
all
night
long
to
present
to
the
doctor
as
an
incontestable
argument
in
favor
of
an
opiate
whiter
than
his
rumpled
bed
but
freshened
and
brightened
and
deceptively
free
from
pain
he
woke
at
last
to
find
the
pleasant
yellow
sunshine
mottling
his
dingy
carpet
like
a
cat
instinctively
with
his
first
yawny
return
to
consciousness
he
reached
back
under
his
pillow
for
cornelia
letter
out
of
the
stiff
envelope
fluttered
instead
the
tiny
circular
to
which
cornelia
had
referred
so
scathingly
it
was
a
dainty
bit
of
gray
japanese
tissue
with
the
text
glowing
gaily
across
it
something
in
the
whole
color
scheme
and
the
riotously
quirky
typography
suggested
at
once
the
audaciously
original
work
of
some
young
art
student
who
was
fairly
splashing
her
way
along
the
road
to
financial
independence
if
not
to
fame
and
this
is
what
the
little
circular
said
flushing
redder
and
redder
and
redder

each
ingenuous
statement

as
stanton
finished
reading
the
last
solemn
business
detail
he
crumpled
up
the
circular
into
a
little
gray
wad
and
pressed
his
blond
head
back
into
the
pillows
and
grinned
and
grinned
good
enough
he
chuckled
if
cornelia
wo
write
to
me
there
seem
to
be
lots
of
other
congenial
souls
who
will
cannibals
and
rodents

all
the
same
he
ruminated
suddenly
all
the
same
wager
that
there
an
awfully
decent
little
brain
working
away
behind
all
that
red
ink
and
nonsense
still
grinning
he
conjured
up
the
vision
of
some
in
a
desolate
country
town
starting
out
at
last
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
with
real
cheery
rain
or
shine
to
join
the
laughing
jostling
deliriously
human
saturday
night
crowd
at
the
village
herself
the
only
person
whose
expected
letter
never
failed
to
come
from
squirrel
or
pirate
or
hopping
hottentot
what
did
it
matter
to
her
just
the
envelope
alone
was
worth
the
price
of
the
subscription
how
the
high
school
girls
elbowed
each
other
to
get
a
peep
at
the
how
the
better
still
perhaps
some
hopelessly
unpopular
man
in
a
dingy
city
office
would
go
running
up
the
last
steps
just
a
little
wee
bit
faster
say
the
second
and
fourth
mondays
in
the
month
because
of
even
a
bought
letter
from
mary
queen
of
scots
that
he
knew
absolutely
without
slip
or
blunder
would
be
waiting
there
for
him
on
his
dusty
desk
among
all
the
litter
of
bills
and
invoices
concerning
shoe
leather
whether
queen
of
scots
prattled
pertly
of
ancient
english
politics
or
whimpered
piteously
about
modern
fashions
what
did
it
matter
so
long
as
the
letter
came
and
smelled
of
faded
or
of
darnley
tobacco
smoke
altogether
pleased
by
the
vividness
of
both
these
pictures
stanton
turned
quite
amiably
to
his
breakfast
and
gulped
down
a
lukewarm
bowl
of
milk
without
half
his
usual
complaint
illustration
good
enough
he
chuckled
it
was
almost
noon
before
his
troubles
commenced
again
then
like
a
raging
hot
tide
the
pain
began
in
the
soft
fleshy
soles
of
his
feet
and
mounted
up
inch
by
inch
through
the
calves
of
his
legs
through
his
aching
thighs
through
his
tortured
back
through
his
cringing
neck
till
the
whole
reeking
misery
seemed
to
foam
and
froth
in
his
brain
in
an
utter
frenzy
of
furious
resentment
again
the
day
dragged
by
with
maddening
monotony
and
loneliness
again
the
clock
mocked
him
and
the
postman
shirked
him
and
the
janitor
forgot
him
again
the
big
black
night
came
crowding
down
and
stung
him
and
smothered
him
into
a
countless
number
of
new
torments
again
the
treacherous
morning
nap
wiped
out
all
traces
of
the
pain
and
left
the
doctor
still
mercilessly
obdurate
on
the
subject
of
an
opiate
and
cornelia
did
not
write
not
till
the
fifth
day
did
a
brief
little
southern
note
arrive
informing
him
of
the
ordinary
vital
truths
concerning
a
comfortable
journey
and
expressing
a
chaste
hope
that
he
would
not
forget
her
not
even
surprise
not
even
curiosity
tempted
stanton
to
wade
twice
through
the
fashionable
angular
handwriting
dully
impersonal
bleak
as
the
shadow
of
a
brown
leaf
across
a
block
of
gray
granite
plainly
unforgivably
written
with
ink
and
ink
only
the
stupid
loveless
page
slipped
through
his
fingers
to
the
floor
after
the
long
waiting
and
the
fretful
impatience
of
the
past
few
days
there
were
only
two
plausible
ways
in
which
to
treat
such
a
letter
one
way
was
with
anger
one
way
was
with
amusement
with
conscientious
effort
stanton
finally
summoned
a
real
smile
to
his
lips
stretching
out
perilously
from
his
snug
bed
he
gathered
the
into
his
arms
and
commenced
to
dig
in
it
like
a
sportive
terrier
after
a
messy
minute
or
two
he
successfully
excavated
the
crumpled
little
gray
tissue
circular
and
smoothed
it
out
carefully
on
his
knees
the
expression
in
his
eyes
all
the
time
was
quite
a
curious
mixture
of
mischief
and
malice
and
rheumatism
after
all
he
reasoned
out
of
one
corner
of
his
mouth
after
all
perhaps
i
have
misjudged
cornelia
maybe
it
only
that
she
really
does
know
just
what
a
ought
to
be
like
then
with
a
slobbering
and
a
few
exclamations
he
proceeded
to
write
out
a
rather
large
check
and
a
very
small
note
to
the
he
addressed
himself
brazenly
for
the
enclosed
check
which
you
will
notice
doubles
the
amount
of
your
advertised

etc
sorrowfully
then
for
a
moment
he
studied
the
depleted
balance
in
his
of
course
he
argued
not
unguiltily
of
course
that
check
was
just
the
amount
that
i
was
planning
to
spend
on
a
belt
for
cornelia
birthday
but
if
brains
really
need
more
adorning
than
does
her
body
if
this
special
investment
in
fact
will
mean
more
to
both
of
us
in
the
long
run
than
a
dozen
turquoise
belts
big
and
bland
and
blond
and
beautiful
cornelia
physical
personality
loomed
up
suddenly
in
his
memory
so
big
in
fact
so
bland
so
blond
so
splendidly
beautiful
that
he
realized
abruptly
with
a
strange
little
tucked
feeling
in
his
heart
that
the
question
of
brains
had
never
yet
occurred
to
him
pushing
the
thought
impatiently
aside
he
sank
back
luxuriantly
again
into
his
pillows
and
grinned
without
any
perceptible
effort
at
all
as
he
planned
adroitly
how
he
would
paste
the
serial
love
letters
one
by
one
into
the
gaudiest
looking
that
he
could
find
and
present
it
to
cornelia
on
her
birthday
as
a
for
the
newly
engaged
girl
and
he
hoped
and
prayed
with
all
his
heart
that
every
individual
letter
would
be
printed
with
crimson
ink
on
a
page
and
would
fairly
reek
from
date
to
signature
with
all
the
joyous
ecstatic
silliness
that
graces
either
an
novel
or
a
modern
suit
so
quite
worn
out
at
last
with
all
this
unwonted
excitement
he
drowsed
off
to
sleep
for
as
long
as
ten
minutes
and
dreamed
that
he
was
a
bigamist
the
next
day
and
the
next
night
were
stale
and
mean
and
musty
with
a
drizzling
winter
rain
but
the
following
morning
crashed
inconsiderately
into
the
world
limp
face
like
a
snowball
spiked
with
icicles
gasping
for
breath
and
crunching
for
foothold
the
sidewalk
people
breasted
the
gritty
cold
puckered
with
chills
and
the
fireside
people
huddled
and
sneezed
around
their
respective
hearths
shivering
like
the
ague
between
his
blankets
stanton
courage
fairly
raced
the
mercury
in
its
downward
course
by
noon
his
teeth
were
chattering
like
a
mouthful
of
cracked
ice
by
night
the
sob
in
his
thirsty
throat
was
like
a
lump
of
salt
and
snow
but
nothing
outdoors
or
in
from
morning
till
night
was
half
as
wretchedly
cold
and
clammy
as
the
rapidly
congealing
bottle
that
slopped
and
gurgled
between
his
aching
shoulders
it
was
just
after
supper
when
a
messenger
boy
blurted
in
from
the
frigid
hall
with
a
great
gust
of
cold
and
a
long
pasteboard
box
and
a
letter
frowning
with
perplexity
stanton
clumsy
fingers
finally
dislodged
from
the
box
a
big
soft
with
an
astonishingly
strange
blurry
pattern
of
green
and
red
against
a
somber
background
of
rusty
black
with
increasing
amazement
he
picked
up
the
accompanying
letter
and
scanned
it
hastily
dear
lad
the
letter
began
quite
intimately
but
it
was
not
signed
cornelia
it
was
signed
molly
ii
turning
nervously
back
to
the
box
stanton
read
once
more
the
perfectly
plain
perfectly
unmistakable
name
and
address
his
own
repeated
in
absolute
duplicate
on
the
envelope
quicker
than
his
mental
comprehension
mere
physical
embarrassment
began
to
flush
across
his
then
suddenly
the
whole
truth
dawned
on
him
the
first
installment
of
his
had
arrived
but
i
thought
thought
it
would
be
he
stammered
miserably
to
himself
i
thought
it
would
be
a
be
a
hectographed
kind
of
a
thing
why
hang
it
all
it
a
real
letter
and
when
i
doubled
my
check
and
called
for
a
special
edition
de
luxe
i
sitting
up
on
my
hind
legs
begging
for
real
presents
but
dear
lad
persisted
the
pleasant
round
almost
childish
handwriting
dear
lad
i
could
have
yesterday
when
i
got
your
letter
telling
me
how
sick
you
were
yes
but
crying
you
any
would
it
so
just
to
send
you
something
to
prove
that
i
thinking
of
you
here
a
great
rollicking
woolly
wrapper
to
keep
you
snug
and
warm
this
very
night
i
wonder
if
it
would
interest
you
any
at
all
to
know
that
it
is
made
out
of
a
most
larksome
outlaw
up
on
my
grandfather
farm
a
really
truly
black
sheep
that
i
raised
all
my
own
sweaters
and
mittens
on
for
the
past
five
years
only
it
takes
two
whole
seasons
to
raise
a
so
please
be
awfully
much
delighted
with
it
and
oh
sick
boy
when
you
look
at
the
funny
blurry
colors
could
you
just
please
pretend
that
the
tinge
of
green
is
the
flavor
of
pleasant
pastures
and
that
the
streak
of
red
is
the
cardinal
flower
that
blazed
along
the
edge
of
the
noisy
brook
goodby
till
molly
with
a
face
so
altogether
crowded
with
astonishment
that
there
was
no
room
left
in
it
for
pain
stanton
lame
fingers
reached
out
inquisitively
and
patted
the
warm
woolly
fabric
nice
old
lamb
y
he
acknowledged
judicially
then
suddenly
around
the
corners
of
his
under
lip
a
little
balky
smile
began
to
flicker
of
course
i
save
the
letter
for
cornelia
he
protested
but
no
one
could
really
expect
me
to
paste
such
a
scrumptious
into
a
laboriously
wriggling
his
thinness
and
his
coldness
into
the
black
sheep
luxuriant
irresponsible
fleece
a
bulging
in
the
wrapper
bruised
his
hip
reaching
down
very
temperishly
to
the
pocket
he
drew
forth
a
small
handkerchief
knotted
pudgily
across
a
brimming
handful
of
needles
like
a
scorching
hot
august
breeze
the
magic
woodsy
fragrance
crinkled
through
his
nostrils
these
people
certainly
know
how
to
play
the
game
all
right
he
reasoned
whimsically
noting
even
the
consistent
little
letter
m
embroidered
in
one
corner
of
the
handkerchief
then
because
he
was
really
very
sick
and
really
very
tired
he
snuggled
down
into
the
new
blessed
warmth
and
turned
his
gaunt
cheek
to
the
pillow
and
cupped
his
hand
for
sleep
like
a
drowsy
child
with
its
nose
and
mouth
burrowed
eagerly
down
into
the
expectant
draught
but
the
cup
did
not
yet
scented
deep
in
his
curved
empty
fingers
lurked
somehow
somewhere
the
dregs
of
a
wonderful
dream
boyhood
with
the
hot
sweet
flutter
of
summer
woods
and
the
pillowing
warmth
of
the
soft
sunbaked
earth
and
the
crackle
of
a
twig
and
the
call
of
a
bird
and
the
drone
of
a
bee
and
the
great
blue
blue
mystery
of
the
sky
glinting
down
through
a
canopy
overhead
for
the
first
time
in
a
whole
cruel
tortuous
week
he
actually
smiled
his
way
into
his
morning
nap
when
he
woke
again
both
the
sun
and
the
doctor
were
staring
pleasantly
into
his
face
you
look
better
said
the
doctor
and
more
than
that
you
do
look
half
so
cross
sure
grinned
stanton
with
all
the
deceptive
undauntable
optimism
of
the
nevertheless
continued
the
doctor
more
soberly
there
ought
to
be
somebody
a
trifle
more
interested
in
you
than
the
janitor
to
look
after
your
food
and
your
medicine
and
all
that
i
going
to
send
you
a
nurse
oh
no
gasped
stanton
i
do
need
one
and
frankly
i
afford
one
shy
as
a
girl
his
eyes
eluded
the
doctor
frank
stare
you
see
he
explained
diffidently
you
see
i
just
engaged
to
be
married
and
though
business
is
fairly
good
and
all
that
my
being
away
from
the
office
six
or
eight
weeks
is
going
to
cut
like
the
deuce
into
my
commissions
and
roses
cost
such
a
horrid
price
last
fall
and
there
seems
to
be
a
game
law
on
diamonds
this
year
they
practically
fine
you
for
buying
them
and
the
doctor
face
brightened
irrelevantly
is
she
a
boston
young
lady
he
queried
oh
yes
beamed
stanton
good
said
the
doctor
then
of
course
she
can
keep
some
sort
of
an
eye
on
you
i
like
to
see
her
i
like
to
talk
with
her
give
her
just
a
few
general
directions
as
it
were
a
flush
deeper
than
any
mere
spread
suddenly
over
stanton
face
she
is
here
he
acknowledged
with
barely
analyzable
mortification
she
just
gone
south
gone
south
repeated
the
doctor
you
do
mean
since
you
been
sick
stanton
nodded
with
a
rather
wobbly
grin
and
the
doctor
changed
the
subject
abruptly
and
busied
himself
quickly
with
the
least
medicine
that
he
could
concoct
then
left
alone
once
more
with
a
short
breakfast
and
a
long
morning
stanton
sank
back
gradually
into
a
depression
infinitely
deeper
than
his
pillows
in
which
he
seemed
to
realize
with
bitter
contrition
that
in
some
strange
unintentional
manner
his
purely
innocent
statement
that
cornelia
had
just
gone
south
had
assumed
the
gigantic
disloyalty
of
a
public
proclamation
that
the
lady
of
his
choice
was
not
quite
up
to
the
accepted
standard
of
feminine
intelligence
or
affections
though
to
save
his
life
he
could
not
recall
any
single
glum
word
or
gloomy
gesture
that
could
possibly
have
conveyed
any
such
erroneous
impression
to
the
doctor
illustration
every
girl
like
cornelia
had
to
go
south
sometime
between
november
and
march
why
cornelia
to
go
south
he
reasoned
conscientiously
every
girl
like
cornelia
to
go
south
sometime
between
november
and
march
how
could
any
mere
man
even
hope
to
keep
rare
choice
exquisite
creatures
like
that
cooped
up
in
a
slushy
snowy
new
england
city
when
all
the
bright
gorgeous
south
was
waiting
for
them
with
open
arms
arms
apparently
it
was
only
that
were
allowed
any
such
privileges
with
girls
like
cornelia
yet
after
all
was
it
just
exactly
that
very
quality
of
serene
dignified
aloofness
that
had
attracted
him
first
to
cornelia
among
the
score
of
girls
of
his
acquaintance
glumly
reverting
to
his
morning
paper
he
began
to
read
and
reread
with
dogged
persistence
each
item
of
politics
and
foreign
news
each
gibbering
advertisement
at
noon
the
postman
dropped
some
kind
of
a
message
through
the
slit
in
the
door
but
the
plainly
discernible
green
stamp
forbade
any
possible
hope
that
it
was
a
letter
from
the
south
at
four
again
someone
thrust
an
offensive
pink
gas
bill
through
the
at
six
stanton
stubbornly
shut
his
eyes
up
perfectly
tight
and
muffled
his
ears
in
the
pillow
so
that
he
would
not
even
know
whether
the
postman
came
or
not
the
only
thing
that
finally
roused
him
to
plain
sense
again
was
the
joggle
of
the
janitor
foot
kicking
mercilessly
against
the
bed
here
your
supper
growled
the
janitor
on
the
bare
tin
tray
tucked
in
between
the
cup
of
gruel
and
the
slice
of
toast
loomed
an
envelope
a
real
rather
envelope
instantly
from
stanton
mind
vanished
every
conceivable
sad
thought
concerning
cornelia
with
his
heart
thumping
like
the
heart
of
any
school
girl
he
reached
out
and
grabbed
what
he
supposed
was
cornelia
letter
but
it
was
boston
and
the
handwriting
was
quite
plainly
the
handwriting
of
the
muttering
an
exclamation
that
was
not
altogether
pretty
he
threw
the
letter
as
far
as
he
could
throw
it
out
into
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
turning
back
to
his
supper
began
to
crunch
his
toast
furiously
like
a
dragon
crunching
bones
at
nine
he
was
still
awake
at
ten
he
was
still
awake
at
eleven
he
was
still
awake
at
twelve
he
was
still
awake
at
one
he
was
almost
crazy
by
quarter
past
one
as
though
fairly
hypnotized
his
eyes
began
to
rivet
themselves
on
the
little
bright
spot
in
the
rug
where
the
lay
gleaming
whitely
in
a
beam
of
electric
light
from
the
street
finally
in
one
supreme
childish
impulse
of
petulant
curiosity
he
scrambled
shiveringly
out
of
his
blankets
with
many
o
h
and
recaptured
the
letter
and
took
it
growlingly
back
to
his
warm
bed
worn
out
quite
as
much
with
the
grinding
monotony
of
his
rheumatic
pains
as
with
their
actual
acuteness
the
new
discomfort
of
straining
his
eyes
under
the
feeble
rays
of
his
seemed
almost
a
pleasant
diversion
the
envelope
was
certainly
fat
as
he
ripped
it
open
three
or
four
folded
papers
like
all
duly
numbered
fell
out
of
it
with
increasing
inquisitiveness
he
drew
forth
the
letter
itself
dear
honey
said
the
letter
quite
boldly
absurd
as
it
was
the
phrase
crinkled
stanton
heart
just
the
merest
trifle
dear
honey
there
are
so
many
things
about
your
sickness
that
worry
me
yes
there
are
i
worry
about
your
pain
i
worry
about
the
horrid
food
that
you
probably
getting
i
worry
about
the
coldness
of
your
room
but
most
of
anything
in
the
world
i
worry
about
your
of
course
you
sleep
that
the
trouble
with
rheumatism
it
such
an
old
now
do
you
know
what
i
going
to
do
to
you
i
going
to
evolve
myself
into
a
sort
of
a
rheumatic
nights
entertainment
for
the
sole
and
explicit
purpose
of
trying
to
while
away
some
of
your
long
dark
hours
because
if
you
simply
to
stay
awake
all
night
long
and
think
you
might
just
as
well
be
thinking
about
me
carl
stanton
what
do
you
dare
smile
and
suggest
for
a
moment
that
just
because
of
the
absence
between
us
i
can
not
make
myself
vivid
to
you
ho
silly
boy
do
you
know
that
the
plainest
sort
of
black
ink
throbs
more
than
some
blood
and
the
touch
of
the
softest
hand
is
a
harsh
caress
compared
to
the
touch
of
a
reasonably
shrewd
pen
here
now
i
say
this
very
moment
lift
this
letter
of
mine
to
your
face
and
swear
if
you
honestly
able
to
that
you
ca
smell
the
rose
in
my
hair
a
cinnamon
rose
would
you
say
a
yellow
cinnamon
rose
not
quite
so
lusciously
fragrant
as
those
in
your
grandmother
july
garden
a
trifle
paler
perceptibly
cooler
something
forced
into
blossom
perhaps
behind
brittle
glass
under
barren
winter
moonshine
and
yet
hear
me
laugh
you
did
really
mean
to
let
yourself
lift
the
page
and
smell
it
did
you
but
what
did
i
tell
you
i
must
waste
too
much
time
though
on
this
nonsense
what
i
really
wanted
to
say
to
you
was
here
are
four
not
potions
but
waking
potions
just
four
silly
little
bits
of
news
for
you
to
think
about
at
one
and
two
and
three
and
four
if
you
happen
to
be
so
miserable
as
to
be
awake
even
then
with
my
love
molly
whimsically
stanton
rummaged
around
in
the
creases
of
the
and
extricated
the
little
folded
paper
marked
no
the
news
in
it
was
utterly
brief
my
hair
is
red
was
all
that
it
announced
with
a
sniff
of
amusement
stanton
collapsed
again
into
his
pillows
for
almost
an
hour
then
he
lay
considering
solemnly
whether
a
girl
could
possibly
be
pretty
by
two
he
had
finally
visualized
quite
a
striking
type
of
beauty
with
a
figure
about
the
regal
height
of
cornelia
and
blue
eyes
perhaps
just
a
trifle
hazier
and
more
mischievous
but
the
little
folded
paper
marked
no
announced
destructively
my
eyes
are
brown
and
i
am
little
with
an
absurdly
resolute
intention
to
play
the
game
every
bit
as
genuinely
as
miss
was
playing
it
stanton
refrained
quite
heroically
from
opening
the
third
dose
of
news
until
at
least
two
big
resonant
city
clocks
had
insisted
that
the
hour
was
ripe
by
that
time
the
grin
in
his
face
was
almost
bright
enough
of
itself
to
illuminate
any
ordinary
page
i
am
lame
confided
the
third
message
somewhat
depressingly
then
snugglingly
in
parenthesis
like
the
tickle
of
lips
against
his
ear
whispered
the
one
phrase
my
picture
is
in
the
fourth
paper
if
you
should
happen
still
to
be
awake
at
four
where
now
was
stanton
boasted
sense
of
honor
concerning
the
ethics
of
playing
the
game
according
to
directions
wait
a
whole
hour
to
see
what
molly
looked
like
well
he
guessed
not
fumbling
frantically
under
his
pillow
and
across
the
medicine
stand
he
began
to
search
for
the
missing
no
quite
out
of
breath
at
last
he
discovered
it
lying
on
the
floor
a
whole
arm
length
away
from
the
bed
only
with
a
really
acute
stab
of
pain
did
he
finally
succeed
in
reaching
it
then
with
fingers
fairly
trembling
with
effort
he
opened
forth
and
disclosed
a
tiny
photograph
of
a
much
elderly
dame
with
a
huge
gray
pompadour
illustration
an
elderly
dame
stung
said
stanton
rheumatism
or
anger
or
something
buzzed
in
his
heart
like
a
bee
the
rest
of
the
night
fortunately
in
the
very
first
mail
the
next
morning
a
came
from
cornelia
such
a
pretty
too
with
a
picture
of
an
inordinately
riggy
looking
ostrich
staring
over
a
neat
wire
fence
at
an
eager
group
of
unmistakably
northern
tourists
underneath
the
picture
was
written
in
cornelia
own
precious
hand
the
information
we
went
to
see
the
ostrich
farm
yesterday
it
was
really
very
interesting
iii
for
quite
a
long
time
stanton
lay
and
considered
the
matter
judicially
from
every
possible
point
of
view
it
would
have
been
rather
pleasant
he
mused
to
know
who
were
almost
childishly
his
face
cuddled
into
the
pillow
she
might
at
least
have
told
me
the
name
of
the
ostrich
he
smiled
grimly
thus
quite
utterly
denied
any
nourishing
food
for
his
thoughts
his
hungry
mind
reverted
very
naturally
to
the
tantalizing
evasive
sweetly
spicy
fragrance
of
the
episode
before
the
really
dreadful
photograph
of
the
unhappy
had
burst
upon
his
blinking
vision
scowlingly
he
picked
up
the
picture
and
stared
and
stared
at
it
certainly
it
was
grim
but
even
from
its
grimness
emanated
the
same
faint
mysterious
odor
of
cinnamon
roses
that
lurked
in
the
accompanying
letter
there
some
dreadful
mistake
somewhere
he
insisted
then
suddenly
he
began
to
laugh
and
reaching
out
once
more
for
pen
and
paper
inscribed
his
second
letter
and
his
first
complaint
to
the
to
the
he
wrote
sternly
with
many
ferocious
tremors
of
dignity
and
rheumatism
kindly
allow
me
to
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
in
my
recent
order
of
the
the
specifications
distinctly
stated
and
any
correspondence
whatsoever
no
matter
how
exhilarating
from
either
a
squirrel
or
a
sea
pirate
as
evidenced
by
enclosed
photograph
which
i
am
hereby
returning
please
refund
money
at
once
or
forward
me
without
delay
a
consistent
photograph
of
a
edition
de
luxe
girl
very
truly
yours
the
letter
was
mailed
by
the
janitor
long
before
noon
even
as
late
as
eleven
that
night
stanton
was
still
hopefully
expecting
an
answer
nor
was
he
altogether
disappointed
just
before
midnight
a
messenger
boy
appeared
with
a
manilla
envelope
quite
stiff
and
important
looking
oh
please
sir
said
the
enclosed
letter
oh
please
sir
we
can
not
refund
your
subscription
money
because
we
have
spent
it
but
if
you
will
only
be
patient
we
feel
quite
certain
that
you
will
be
altogether
satisfied
in
the
long
run
with
the
material
offered
you
as
for
the
photograph
recently
forwarded
to
you
kindly
accept
our
apologies
for
a
very
clumsy
mistake
made
here
in
the
office
do
any
of
these
other
types
suit
you
better
kindly
mark
selection
and
return
all
pictures
at
your
earliest
convenience
before
the
messenger
boy
astonished
interest
stanton
spread
out
on
the
bed
all
around
him
a
dozen
soft
photographs
of
a
dozen
different
girls
stately
in
satin
or
simple
in
gingham
or
deliciously
hoydenish
in
they
challenged
his
surprised
attention
blonde
brunette
tall
short
posing
with
wistful
tenderness
in
the
flickering
glow
of
an
open
fire
or
smiling
frankly
out
of
a
purely
conventional
vignette
they
one
and
all
defied
him
to
choose
between
them
oh
oh
laughed
stanton
to
himself
am
i
to
try
and
separate
her
picture
from
eleven
pictures
of
her
friends
so
that
the
game
is
it
well
i
guess
not
does
she
think
i
going
to
risk
choosing
a
girl
if
the
gentle
little
creature
with
the
pansies
is
really
herself
or
suppose
she
truly
is
the
enchanting
little
would
she
probably
write
me
any
more
nice
funny
letters
if
i
solemnly
selected
her
sentimental
friend
at
the
heavily
draped
window
craftily
he
returned
all
the
pictures
unmarked
to
the
envelope
and
changing
the
address
hurried
the
messenger
boy
off
to
remail
it
just
this
little
note
hastily
scribbled
in
pencil
went
with
the
envelope
dear
the
pictures
are
not
altogether
satisfactory
it
is
a
that
i
am
looking
for
but
a
definite
likeness
of
herself
kindly
rectify
the
mistake
without
further
delay
or
refund
the
money
almost
all
the
rest
of
the
night
he
amused
himself
chuckling
to
think
how
the
terrible
threat
about
refunding
the
money
would
confuse
and
conquer
the
extravagant
little
art
student
but
it
was
his
own
hands
that
did
the
nervous
trembling
when
he
opened
the
big
express
package
that
arrived
the
next
evening
just
as
his
tiresome
porridge
supper
was
finished
ah
sweetheart
said
the
dainty
note
tucked
inside
the
package
ah
sweetheart
the
little
god
of
love
be
praised
for
one
true
lover
yourself
so
it
is
a
picture
of
that
you
want
the
the
no
mere
pink
and
white
likeness
no
actual
proof
even
of
and
yellow
age
no
coquettish
attractiveness
that
the
and
the
trapped
me
into
for
that
one
single
second
no
deceptive
profile
of
the
best
side
of
my
face
and
i
perhaps
blind
in
the
other
eye
not
even
a
fair
honest
portrait
of
my
father
and
mother
composite
features
but
a
picture
of
hooray
for
you
a
picture
then
not
of
my
physiognomy
but
of
my
very
well
sir
here
is
the
portrait
true
to
the
life
in
this
great
clumsy
conglomerate
package
of
articles
that
represent
perhaps
not
even
so
much
the
prosy
literal
things
that
i
am
as
the
much
more
illuminating
and
significant
things
that
would
like
to
it
what
we
would
to
be
that
really
tells
most
about
us
it
carl
stanton
the
brown
that
i
have
to
wear
talks
loudly
enough
for
instance
about
the
color
of
my
complexion
but
the
forbidden
pink
that
i
most
crave
whispers
infinitely
more
intimately
concerning
the
color
of
my
spirit
and
as
to
my
face
i
really
obliged
to
have
a
oh
no
o
without
words
are
surely
the
only
songs
in
the
world
that
are
packed
to
the
last
lilting
note
with
utterly
limitless
meanings
so
in
these
without
faces
i
cast
myself
quite
serenely
upon
the
mercy
of
your
imagination
what
that
you
say
that
i
simply
to
have
a
face
oh
darn
well
do
your
worst
conjure
up
for
me
then
here
and
now
any
sort
of
features
whatsoever
that
please
your
fancy
only
man
of
mine
just
remember
this
in
your
imaginings
gift
me
with
beauty
if
you
like
or
gift
me
with
brains
but
do
not
make
the
crude
masculine
mistake
of
gifting
me
with
both
thought
furrows
faces
you
know
and
after
adolescence
only
inanity
retains
its
heavenly
smoothness
beauty
even
at
its
worst
is
a
gorgeously
perfect
lawn
over
which
the
most
ordinary
errands
of
life
can
not
cross
without
scarring
and
brains
at
their
best
are
only
a
ploughed
field
teeming
always
and
forever
with
the
worries
of
incalculable
harvests
make
me
a
little
pretty
if
you
like
and
a
little
wise
but
not
too
much
of
either
if
you
value
the
verities
of
your
vision
there
i
say
do
your
worst
make
me
that
face
and
that
face
only
that
you
the
in
all
this
big
lonesome
world
food
for
your
heart
or
fragrance
for
your
nostrils
only
one
face
or
another
i
insist
upon
having
molly
with
his
lower
lip
twisted
oddly
under
the
bite
of
his
strong
white
teeth
stanton
began
to
unwrap
the
various
packages
that
comprised
the
large
bundle
if
it
was
a
portrait
it
certainly
represented
a
first
there
was
a
small
scarlet
slipper
with
a
fluffy
gold
toe
to
it
definitely
feminine
definitely
small
so
much
for
that
then
there
was
a
ferociously
stubby
and
rather
confusingly
boyish
after
that
round
and
flat
and
tantalizing
as
an
empty
plate
the
phonograph
disc
of
a
totally
unfamiliar
song
the
sea
gull
cry
a
clue
surely
to
neither
age
nor
sex
but
indicative
possibly
of
musical
preference
or
mere
individual
temperament
after
that
a
tiny
geographical
globe
with
kipling
phrase
for
to
admire
an
for
to
see
for
to
this
world
so
wide
it
never
done
no
good
to
me
but
i
ca
drop
it
if
i
tried
written
slantingly
in
very
black
ink
across
both
hemispheres
then
an
empty
purse
with
a
hole
in
it
a
gauntlet
such
as
horsemen
wear
on
the
mexican
frontier
a
white
partly
embroidered
with
silky
blue
the
threaded
needle
still
jabbed
in
the
work
and
the
small
thimble
stanton
could
have
sworn
still
warm
from
the
snuggle
of
somebody
finger
last
of
all
a
fat
and
formidable
edition
of
robert
browning
poems
a
tiny
black
such
as
masqueraders
wear
and
a
shimmering
gilt
picture
frame
inclosing
a
pert
yet
not
irreverent
handmade
adaptation
of
a
certain
portion
of
paul
epistle
to
the
corinthians
though
i
speak
with
the
tongues
of
men
and
of
angels
and
have
not
a
sense
of
humor
i
am
become
as
sounding
brass
or
a
tinkling
symbol
and
though
i
have
the
gift
of
prophecy
and
all
knowledge
so
that
i
could
remove
mountains
and
have
not
a
sense
of
humor
i
am
nothing
and
though
i
bestow
all
my
goods
to
feed
the
poor
and
though
i
give
my
body
to
be
burned
and
have
not
a
sense
of
humor
it
profiteth
me
nothing
a
sense
of
humor
suffereth
long
and
is
kind
a
sense
of
humor
envieth
not
a
sense
of
humor
vaunteth
not

not
puffed
up

not
easily
provoked
thinketh
no
evil
beareth
all

all
things
a
sense
of
humor
never
faileth
but
whether
there
be
unpleasant
prophecies
they
shall
fail
whether
there
be
scolding
tongues
they
shall
cease
whether
there

unfortunate
knowledge
it
shall
vanish
away
when
i
was
a
child
i

as
a
child
i
understood
as
a
child
but
when
i
became
a
woman
i
put
away

and
now

hope
charity
these
three
the
greatest
of
these
is
a
sense
of
humor
with
a
little
chuckle
of
amusement
not
altogether
devoid
of
a
very
definite
consciousness
of
being
stanton
spread
all
the
articles
out
on
the
before
him
and
tried
to
piece
them
together
like
the
fragments
of
any
other
puzzle
was
the
young
lady
as
intellectual
as
the
robert
browning
poems
suggested
or
did
she
mean
simply
to
imply
that
she
she
were
and
did
the
fit
by
any
possible
chance
with
the
dainty
feminine
scrap
of
domestic
embroidery
and
was
the
empty
purse
supposed
to
be
especially
significant
of
an
inordinate
fondness
for
phonograph
music
or
what
pondering
puzzling
fretting
fussing
he
dozed
off
to
sleep
at
last
before
he
even
knew
that
it
was
almost
morning
and
when
he
finally
woke
again
he
found
the
doctor
laughing
at
him
because
he
lay
holding
a
scarlet
slipper
in
his
hand
iv
the
next
night
very
very
late
in
a
furious
riot
of
wind
and
snow
and
sleet
a
clerk
from
the
just
around
the
corner
appeared
with
a
perfectly
huge
bottle
fairly
sizzling
and
bubbling
with
warmth
and
relief
for
aching
rheumatic
backs
well
where
in
thunder
groaned
stanton
out
of
his
cold
and
pain
and
misery
search
me
said
the
drug
clerk
the
order
and
the
money
for
it
came
in
the
last
mail
this
evening
deliver
bottle
boiling
hot
to
carl
stanton
gasped
stanton
then
oh
i
wish
i
could
purr
as
he
settled
cautiously
back
at
last
to
toast
his
pains
against
the
blessed
scorching
heat
most
girls
he
reasoned
with
surprising
interest
would
have
sent
ice
cold
violets
shrouded
in
tissue
paper
now
how
does
this
special
girl
know
oh
ouch
i
t
y
he
crooned
himself
to
sleep
the
next
night
just
at
a
appeared
dragging
an
exceedingly
obstreperous
on
the
end
of
a
dangerously
frayed
leash
planting
himself
firmly
on
the
rug
in
the
middle
of
the
room
with
the
faintest
gleam
of
saucy
pink
tongue
showing
between
his
teeth
the
little
beast
sat
and
defied
the
entire
situation
nothing
apparently
but
the
correspondence
concerning
the
situation
was
actually
transferable
from
the
freckled
messenger
boy
to
stanton
himself
oh
dear
lad
said
the
tiny
note
i
forgot
to
tell
you
my
real
name
did
i
well
my
last
name
and
the
dog
first
name
are
just
the
same
funny
is
it
you
find
it
in
the
back
of
almost
any
dictionary
with
love
molly
just
turn
the
puppy
out
in
the
morning
and
he
go
home
all
right
of
his
own
accord
with
his
own
pink
tongue
showing
just
a
trifle
between
his
teeth
stanton
lay
for
a
moment
and
watched
the
dog
on
the
rug
cocking
his
small
keen
white
head
from
one
tippy
angle
to
another
the
little
terrier
returned
the
stare
with
an
expression
that
was
altogether
and
unmistakably
mirthful
oh
it
a
jolly
little
beggar
is
it
said
stanton
come
here
sir
only
a
suddenly
pointed
ear
acknowledged
the
summons
the
dog
himself
did
not
budge
come
here
i
say
stanton
repeated
with
harsh
peremptoriness
palpably
the
little
dog
winked
at
him
then
in
succession
the
little
dog
dodged
adroitly
a
knife
a
spoon
a
copy
of
browning
poems
and
several
other
sizable
articles
from
the
table
close
to
stanton
elbow
nothing
but
the
dictionary
seemed
too
big
to
throw
finally
with
a
grin
that
could
not
be
disguised
even
from
the
dog
stanton
began
to
rummage
with
eye
and
hand
through
the
intricate
back
pages
of
the
dictionary
illustration
a
appeared
dragging
an
exceedingly
obstreperous
you
silly
little
fool
he
said
wo
you
mind
unless
you
are
spoken
to
by
name

he
began
to
read
out
with
petulant
curiosity

what
nonsense

how
could
a

be
named

like
that

imagine
whistling
a
dog
to
the
name
of
gershom

oh

stolidly
with
unheedful
drooping
ears
the
little

seat
on
the
rug
ichabod
jabez
joab
stanton
voice
persisted
experimentally
by
nine
in
all
possible
variations
of
accent
and
intonation
he
had
quite
completely
exhausted
the
alphabetical
list
as
far
as
and
the
little
dog
was
blinking
himself
to
sleep
on
the
far
side
of
the
room
something
about
the
dog
nodding
contentment
started
stanton
mouth
to
yawning
and
for
almost
an
hour
he
lay
in
the
lovely
restful
consciousness
of
being
at
least
half
asleep
but
at
ten
he
roused
up
sharply
and
resumed
the
task
at
hand
which
seemed
suddenly
to
have
assumed
really
vital
importance

lorenzo
marcellus
he
began
again
in
a
loud
clear
compelling
voice
meredith
did
the
little
dog
stir
did
he
sit
up
meredith
meredith
the
little
dog
barked
something
in
stanton
brain
flashed
it
is
for
the
dog
he
quizzed
here
merry
in
another
instant
the
little
creature
had
leaped
upon
the
foot
of
his
bed
and
was
talking
away
at
a
great
rate
with
all
sorts
of
ecstatic
grunts
and
growls
stanton
hand
went
out
almost
shyly
to
the
dog
head
so
it
meredith
he
mused
but
after
all
there
was
no
reason
to
be
shy
about
it
it
was
the
head
he
was
stroking
tied
to
the
little
dog
collar
when
he
went
home
the
next
morning
was
a
tiny
inconspicuous
tag
that
said
that
was
easy
the
name
and
yours
is
funny
name
for
a
dog
but
nice
for
a
girl
the
answers
were
always
prompt
even
though
perplexing
dear
lad
came
this
special
answer
you
are
quite
right
about
the
dog
and
i
compliment
you
heartily
on
your
shrewdness
but
i
must
confess
even
though
it
makes
you
very
angry
with
me
that
i
have
deceived
you
absolutely
concerning
my
own
name
will
you
forgive
me
utterly
if
i
hereby
promise
never
to
deceive
you
again
why
what
could
i
possibly
possibly
do
with
a
great
solemn
name
like
my
truly
name
sir
my
really
truly
name
is
do
you
know
the
funny
little
old
song
about
oh
surely
you
do
molly
keep
to
your
play
if
you
would
not
grieve
for
here
a
hint
for
you
things
that
are
true
are
apt
to
be
blue
now
you
remember
it
do
you
then
there
something
about
molly
wear
it
swear
it
all
the
while
long
as
your
lips
are
framed
for
a
joke
who
can
prove
that
your
heart
is
broke
do
you
love
that
broke
then
there
the
last
verse
my
favorite
molly
make
him
of
mist
or
make
him
of
snow
long
as
your
dream
stays
fine
and
fair
molly
what
do
you
care
well
i
wager
that
her
name
just
the
same
vowed
stanton
and
she
probably
madder
than
scat
to
think
that
i
hit
it
right
whether
the
daily
overtures
from
the
proved
to
be
dogs
or
or
bottles
or
funny
old
songs
it
was
reasonably
evident
that
something
unique
was
practically
guaranteed
to
happen
every
single
individual
night
of
the
six
weeks
subscription
contract
like
a
youngster
joyous
dream
of
chronic
christmas
eves
this
realization
alone
was
enough
to
put
an
absurdly
delicious
thrill
of
expectancy
into
any
invalid
otherwise
prosy
thoughts
yet
the
next
bit
of
attention
from
the
did
not
please
stanton
one
half
as
much
as
it
embarrassed
him
wandering
socially
into
the
room
from
his
own
apartments
below
a
young
lawyer
friend
of
stanton
had
only
just
seated
himself
on
the
foot
of
stanton
bed
when
an
expressman
also
arrived
with
two
large
pasteboard
which
he
straightway
dumped
on
the
bed
between
the
two
men
with
the
laconic
message
that
he
would
call
for
them
again
in
the
morning
heaven
preserve
me
gasped
stanton
what
is
this
fearsomely
out
of
the
smaller
of
the
two
boxes
he
lifted
with
much
rustling
snarl
of
tissue
paper
a
woman
brown
very
soft
very
fluffy
inordinately
jaunty
with
a
rose
nestling
deep
in
the
fur
out
of
the
other
box
twice
as
large
twice
as
rustly
flaunted
a
green
velvet
cavalier
hat
with
a
green
ostrich
feather
as
long
as
a
man
arm
drooping
languidly
off
the
brim
holy
cat
said
stanton
pinned
to
the
green
hat
crown
was
a
tiny
note
the
handwriting
at
least
was
pleasantly
familiar
by
this
time
oh
i
say
cried
the
lawyer
delightedly
with
a
desperately
painful
effort
at
nonchalance
stanton
shoved
his
right
fist
into
the
brown
hat
and
his
left
fist
into
the
green
one
and
raised
them
quizzically
from
the
bed
darned
hats
he
stammered
oh
i
say
repeated
the
lawyer
with
accumulative
delight
crimson
to
the
tip
of
his
ears
stanton
rolled
his
eyes
frantically
towards
the
little
note
she
sent
up
just
to
show
to
me
he
quoted
wildly
just
i
laid
up
so
and
ca
get
out
on
the
streets
to
see
the
styles
for
and
i
got
to
choose
between
them
for
her
he
ejaculated
she
says
she
ca
decide
alone
which
one
to
keep
bully
for
her
cried
the
lawyer
surprisingly
slapping
his
knee
the
cunning
little
girl
speechless
with
astonishment
stanton
lay
and
watched
his
visitor
then
well
which
one
would
you
choose
he
asked
with
unmistakable
relief
the
lawyer
took
the
hats
and
scanned
them
carefully
let
me
see
he
considered
her
hair
is
so
blond
no
it
red
snapped
stanton
with
perfect
courtesy
the
lawyer
swallowed
his
mistake
oh
excuse
me
he
said
i
forgot
but
with
her
height
she
has
any
height
groaned
stanton
i
tell
you
she
little
choose
to
suit
yourself
said
the
lawyer
coolly
he
himself
had
admired
cornelia
from
afar
off
the
next
night
to
stanton
mixed
feelings
of
relief
and
disappointment
the
surprise
seemed
to
consist
in
the
fact
that
nothing
happened
at
all
fully
until
midnight
the
sense
of
relief
comforted
him
utterly
but
some
time
after
midnight
his
hungry
mind
like
a
robbed
of
an
accustomed
meal
began
to
wake
and
fret
and
stalk
around
ferociously
through
all
the
long
empty
aching
early
morning
hours
searching
for
something
novel
to
think
about
by
the
next
evening
he
was
in
an
irritable
mood
that
made
him
fairly
clutch
the
special
delivery
letter
out
of
the
hand
it
was
rather
a
thin
tantalizing
little
letter
too
all
it
said
was
dearest
until
one
in
a
gown
all
shimmery
with
green
and
blue
and
september
i
going
to
sit
up
by
my
white
fire
and
read
aloud
to
you
yes
and
out
of
browning
too
did
you
notice
your
copy
was
marked
what
shall
i
read
to
you
shall
it
be
i
could
have
that
little
head
of
hers
painted
upon
a
background
of
pale
gold
or
i
you
about
myself
do
i
live
in
a
house
you
would
like
to
see
or
am
a
painter
who
can
not
paint
no
end
to
all
i
can
not
do
do
one
thing
at
least
i
can
love
a
man
or
hate
a
man
or
just
me
never
beloved
while
i
am
i
and
you
are
you
oh
honey
wo
it
be
fun
just
you
and
i
perhaps
in
all
this
big
city
sitting
up
and
thinking
about
each
other
can
you
smell
the
white
birch
smoke
in
this
letter
illustration
well
i
be
hanged
growled
stanton
if
i
going
to
be
strung
by
any
boy
almost
unconsciously
stanton
raised
the
page
to
his
face
unmistakably
up
from
the
paper
rose
the
strong
vivid
scent
of
a
pipe
well
i
be
hanged
growled
stanton
if
i
going
to
be
strung
by
any
boy
out
of
all
proportion
the
incident
irritated
him
but
when
the
next
evening
a
perfectly
tremendous
bunch
of
yellow
jonquils
arrived
with
a
penciled
line
suggesting
if
you
put
these
solid
gold
posies
in
your
window
morning
at
eight
so
i
surely
know
just
which
window
is
yours
i
look
up
when
i
go
past
stanton
most
peremptorily
ordered
the
janitor
to
display
the
bouquet
as
ornately
as
possible
along
the
narrow
of
the
biggest
window
that
faced
the
street
then
all
through
the
night
he
lay
dozing
and
waking
intermittently
with
a
lovely
scared
feeling
in
the
pit
of
his
stomach
that
something
really
rather
exciting
was
about
to
happen
by
surely
seven
he
rose
laboriously
from
his
bed
huddled
himself
into
his
wrapper
and
settled
himself
down
as
warmly
as
could
be
expected
close
to
the
draughty
edge
of
the
window
v
little
and
lame
and
and
he
kept
repeating
to
himself
old
people
and
young
people
and
jaunty
young
girls
and
fat
blue
policeman
looked
up
one
and
all
with
faces
at
the
really
gorgeous
flame
of
jonquils
but
in
a
whole
chilly
wearisome
hour
the
only
person
that
passed
was
an
irish
setter
puppy
and
the
only
lame
person
was
a
beggar
cold
and
disgusted
as
he
was
stanton
could
not
altogether
help
laughing
at
his
own
discomfiture
why
hang
that
little
girl
she
ought
to
be
he
chuckled
as
he
climbed
back
into
his
tiresome
bed
then
as
though
to
reward
his
ultimate
the
very
next
mail
brought
him
a
letter
from
cornelia
and
rather
a
remarkable
letter
too
as
in
addition
to
the
usual
impersonal
comments
on
the
weather
and
the
tennis
and
the
annual
orange
crop
there
was
actually
one
whole
individual
intimate
sentence
that
distinguished
the
letter
as
having
been
intended
solely
for
him
rather
than
for
dressmaker
or
her
coachman
invalid
daughter
or
her
own
youngest
brother
this
was
the
sentence
really
carl
you
do
know
how
glad
i
am
that
in
spite
of
all
your
foolish
objections
i
kept
to
my
original
purpose
of
not
announcing
my
engagement
until
after
my
southern
trip
you
no
idea
what
a
big
difference
it
makes
in
a
girl
good
time
at
a
great
hotel
like
this
this
sentence
surely
gave
stanton
a
good
deal
of
food
for
his
thoughts
but
the
mental
indigestion
that
ensued
was
not
altogether
pleasant
not
until
evening
did
his
mood
brighten
again
then
lad
of
mine
whispered
molly
gentler
letter
lad
of
mine
blond
your
hair
even
across
the
tops
of
those
yellow
jonquils
this
morning
i
almost
laughed
to
see
the
blond
blond
shine
of
some
day
i
going
to
stroke
that
hair
yes
the
little
dog
came
home
all
right
with
a
gasp
of
dismay
stanton
sat
up
abruptly
in
bed
and
tried
to
revisualize
every
single
individual
pedestrian
who
had
passed
his
window
in
the
vicinity
of
eight
that
morning
she
evidently
is
lame
at
all
he
argued
or
little
or
or
anything
probably
her
name
is
molly
and
presumably
it
is
even
but
at
least
she
did
go
by
and
is
my
hair
so
very
blond
he
asked
himself
suddenly
against
all
intention
his
mouth
began
to
prance
a
little
at
the
corners
as
soon
as
he
could
possibly
summon
the
janitor
he
despatched
his
third
note
to
the
but
this
one
bore
a
distinctly
sealed
inner
envelope
directed
for
molly
personal
and
the
message
in
it
though
brief
was
utterly
to
the
point
could
you
tell
a
fellow
who
you
are
but
by
the
conventional
hour
the
next
night
he
wished
most
heartily
that
he
had
not
been
so
inquisitive
for
the
only
entertainment
that
came
to
him
at
all
was
a
telegram
warning
him
where
the
apple
reddens
do
not
pry
lest
we
lose
our
eden
you
and
i
the
couplet
was
quite
unfamiliar
to
stanton
but
it
rhymed
sickeningly
through
his
brain
all
night
long
like
the
consciousness
of
an
bank
account
it
was
the
very
next
morning
after
this
that
all
the
boston
papers
flaunted
cornelia
aristocratic
young
portrait
on
their
front
pages
with
the
striking
announcement
that
one
of
fairest
debutantes
makes
a
daring
rescue
in
florida
waters
hotel
cook
capsized
from
row
boat
owes
his
life
to
the
pluck
and
endurance
etc
with
a
great
sob
in
his
throat
and
every
pulse
pounding
stanton
lay
and
read
the
infinite
details
of
the
really
splendid
story
a
group
of
young
girls
dallying
on
the
pier
a
shrill
cry
from
the
bay
the
sudden
helplessness
of
the
spectators
and
then
with
equal
suddenness
the
plunge
of
a
single
feminine
figure
into
the
water
the
long
hard
swim
the
furious
struggle
the
final
victory
stingingly
as
though
it
had
been
fairly
branded
into
his
eyes
he
saw
the
vision
of
cornelia
heroic
young
face
battling
above
the
horrible
depths
of
the
bay
the
bravery
the
risk
the
ghastly
chances
of
a
less
fortunate
ending
sent
shiver
after
shiver
through
his
already
tortured
senses
all
the
loving
thoughts
in
his
nature
fairly
leaped
to
do
tribute
to
cornelia
yes
he
reasoned
cornelia
was
made
like
that
no
matter
what
the
cost
to
herself
no
matter
what
was
the
price
cornelia
would
never
never
fail
to
do
her
when
he
thought
of
the
weary
lagging
riskful
weeks
that
were
still
to
ensue
before
he
should
actually
see
cornelia
again
he
felt
as
though
he
should
go
utterly
mad
the
letter
that
he
wrote
to
cornelia
that
night
was
like
a
letter
written
in
a
man
own
his
hand
trembled
so
that
he
could
scarcely
hold
the
pen
cornelia
did
not
like
the
letter
she
said
so
frankly
the
letter
did
not
seem
to
her
quite
nice
certainly
she
attested
it
was
not
exactly
the
sort
of
letter
that
one
would
like
to
show
one
mother
then
in
a
palpably
conscientious
effort
to
be
kind
as
well
as
just
she
began
to
prattle
inkily
again
about
the
pleasant
warm
sunny
weather
her
only
comment
on
saving
the
drowning
man
was
the
mere
phrase
that
she
was
very
glad
that
she
had
learned
to
be
a
good
swimmer
never
indeed
since
her
absence
had
she
spoken
of
missing
stanton
not
even
now
after
what
was
inevitably
a
adventure
did
she
yield
her
lover
one
single
iota
of
the
information
which
he
had
a
lover
right
to
claim
had
she
been
frightened
for
instance
way
down
in
the
bottom
of
that
serene
heart
of
hers
had
she
been
frightened
in
the
ensuing
desperate
struggle
for
life
had
she
struggled
just
one
little
tiny
bit
harder
because
stanton
was
in
that
life
now
in
the
dreadful
unstrung
reaction
of
the
adventure
did
her
whole
nature
waken
and
yearn
and
cry
out
for
that
one
heart
in
all
the
world
that
belonged
to
her
plainly
by
her
silence
in
the
matter
she
did
not
intend
to
share
anything
as
intimate
even
as
her
fear
of
death
with
the
man
whom
she
claimed
to
love
it
was
just
this
last
touch
of
deliberate
selfish
aloofness
that
startled
stanton
thoughts
with
the
one
persistent
brutally
nagging
question
after
all
was
a
woman
undeniably
glorious
ability
to
save
a
drowning
man
the
supreme
requisite
of
a
happy
marriage
day
by
day
night
by
night
hour
by
hour
minute
by
minute
the
question
began
to
dig
into
stanton
brain
throwing
much
dust
and
confusion
into
otherwise
perfectly
orderly
and
sweet
and
clean
week
by
week
grown
suddenly
and
morbidly
analytical
he
watched
for
cornelia
letters
with
increasingly
passionate
hopefulness
and
met
each
fresh
disappointment
with
increasingly
passionate
resentment
except
for
the
ingeniously
varied
attentions
there
was
practically
nothing
to
help
him
make
either
day
or
night
bearable
more
and
more
cornelia
infrequent
letters
suggested
exquisitely
painted
empty
dishes
offered
to
a
starving
person
more
and
more
molly
whimsical
messages
fed
him
and
nourished
him
and
joyously
pleased
him
like
some
nonsensically
fashioned
that
yet
proved
brimming
full
of
real
food
for
a
real
man
fight
as
he
would
against
it
he
began
to
cherish
a
sense
of
furious
annoyance
that
cornelia
failure
to
provide
for
him
had
so
thrust
him
out
as
it
were
to
feed
among
strangers
with
frowning
perplexity
and
real
worry
he
felt
the
tingling
vivid
consciousness
of
molly
personality
begin
to
permeate
and
impregnate
his
whole
nature
yet
when
he
tried
to
acknowledge
and
thereby
cancel
his
personal
sense
of
obligation
to
this
molly
by
writing
an
exceptionally
civil
note
of
appreciation
to
the
the
answered
him
tersely
pray
do
not
thank
us
for
the
jonquils
etc
surely
they
are
merely
presents
from
yourself
to
yourself
it
is
your
money
that
bought
them
and
when
he
had
replied
briefly
well
thank
you
for
your
brains
then
the
company
had
persisted
with
undue
sharpness
do
thank
us
for
our
brains
brains
are
our
business
vi
it
was
one
day
just
about
the
end
of
the
fifth
week
that
poor
stanton
perplexity
blew
up
noisily
just
like
any
other
kind
of
steam
it
was
the
first
day
too
throughout
all
his
illness
that
he
had
made
even
the
slightest
pretext
of
being
up
and
about
slippered
if
not
booted
if
not
coated
shaven
at
least
if
not
shorn
he
had
established
himself
fairly
comfortably
late
in
the
afternoon
at
his
big
close
to
the
fire
where
in
his
low
morris
chair
with
his
books
and
his
papers
and
his
lamp
close
at
hand
he
had
started
out
once
more
to
try
and
solve
the
absurd
little
problem
that
confronted
him
only
an
occasional
twitch
of
pain
in
his
or
an
intermittent
shudder
of
nerves
along
his
spine
had
interrupted
in
any
possible
way
his
almost
frenzied
absorption
in
his
subject
here
at
the
desk
very
soon
after
the
doctor
had
joined
him
and
with
an
unusual
expression
of
leisure
and
friendliness
had
settled
down
lollingly
on
the
other
side
of
the
fireplace
with
his
great
shoes
nudging
the
bright
brassy
edge
of
the
fender
and
his
big
meerschaum
pipe
puffing
the
whole
bleak
room
most
deliciously
tantalizingly
full
of
forbidden
tobacco
smoke
it
was
a
comfortable
warm
place
to
chat
the
talk
had
begun
with
politics
drifted
a
little
way
toward
the
architecture
of
several
new
city
buildings
hovered
a
moment
over
the
marriage
of
some
mutual
friend
and
then
languished
utterly
with
a
sudden
shrewdness
the
doctor
turned
and
watched
an
unwonted
flicker
of
worry
on
stanton
forehead
what
bothering
you
stanton
he
asked
quickly
surely
you
not
worrying
any
more
about
your
rheumatism
no
said
stanton
it
is
rheumatism
for
an
instant
the
two
men
eyes
held
each
other
and
then
stanton
began
to
laugh
a
trifle
uneasily
doctor
he
asked
quite
abruptly
doctor
do
you
believe
that
any
possible
conditions
could
exist
that
would
make
it
justifiable
for
a
man
to
show
a
woman
to
another
man
why
said
the
doctor
cautiously
i
think
so
there
might
be
circumstances
still
without
any
perceptible
cause
stanton
laughed
again
and
reaching
out
picked
up
a
folded
sheet
of
paper
from
the
table
and
handed
it
to
the
doctor
read
that
will
you
he
asked
and
read
it
out
loud
with
a
slight
protest
of
diffidence
the
doctor
unfolded
the
paper
scanned
the
page
for
an
instant
and
began
slowly
carl
of
mine
there
one
thing
i
forgot
to
tell
you
when
you
go
to
buy
my
engagement
ring
i
do
want
any
no
i
rather
have
two
instead
two
perfectly
plain
gold
and
the
ring
for
my
passive
left
hand
i
want
inscribed
be
a
sweetness
more
desired
than
spring
and
the
ring
for
my
active
right
hand
i
want
inscribed
soul
to
keep
just
that
and
you
need
bother
to
write
me
that
you
understand
because
you
are
not
expected
to
understand
it
is
not
man
prerogative
to
understand
but
you
are
perfectly
welcome
if
you
want
to
call
me
crazy
because
i
am
utterly
crazy
on
just
one
subject
and
why
beloved
if
here
cried
stanton
suddenly
reaching
out
and
grabbing
the
letter
here
you
need
read
any
more
his
cheeks
were
crimson
the
doctor
eyes
focused
sharply
on
his
face
that
girl
loves
you
said
the
doctor
tersely
for
a
moment
then
the
doctor
lips
puffed
silently
at
his
pipe
until
at
last
with
an
almost
bashful
gesture
he
cried
out
abruptly
stanton
somehow
i
feel
as
though
i
owed
you
an
apology
or
rather
owed
your
fiancée
one
somehow
when
you
told
me
that
day
that
your
young
lady
had
gone
gadding
off
to
florida
and
left
you
alone
with
your
sickness
why
i
thought
well
most
evidently
i
have
misjudged
her
stanton
throat
gave
a
little
gasp
then
silenced
again
he
bit
his
lips
furiously
as
though
to
hold
back
an
exclamation
then
suddenly
the
whole
perplexing
truth
burst
forth
from
him
that
is
from
my
fiancée
he
cried
out
that
just
a
professional
i
buy
them
by
the
dozen
so
much
a
week
reaching
back
under
his
pillow
he
extricated
another
letter
is
from
my
fiancée
he
said
read
it
yes
do
aloud
gasped
the
doctor
stanton
nodded
his
forehead
was
wet
with
sweat
dear
carl
the
weather
is
still
very
warm
i
am
riding
horseback
almost
every
morning
however
and
playing
tennis
almost
every
afternoon
there
seem
to
be
an
exceptionally
large
number
of
interesting
people
here
this
winter
in
regard
to
the
list
of
names
you
sent
me
for
the
wedding
really
carl
i
do
not
see
how
i
can
possibly
accommodate
so
many
of
your
friends
without
seriously
curtailing
my
own
list
after
all
you
must
remember
that
it
is
the
bride
day
not
the
groom
and
in
regard
to
your
question
as
to
whether
we
expect
to
be
home
for
christmas
and
could
i
possibly
arrange
to
spend
christmas
day
with
you
why
carl
you
are
perfectly
preposterous
of
course
it
is
very
kind
of
you
to
invite
me
and
all
that
but
how
could
mother
and
i
possibly
come
to
your
rooms
when
our
engagement
is
not
even
announced
and
besides
there
is
going
to
be
a
very
smart
dance
here
christmas
eve
that
i
particularly
wish
to
attend
and
there
are
plenty
of
christmases
coming
for
you
and
me
cordially
yours
cornelia
mother
and
i
hope
that
your
rheumatism
is
much
better
that
the
girl
who
loves
me
said
stanton
not
unhumorously
then
suddenly
all
the
muscles
around
his
mouth
tightened
like
the
facial
muscles
of
a
man
who
is
hammering
something
i
mean
it
he
insisted
i
mean
it
absolutely
that
the
girl
who
loves
me
silently
the
two
men
looked
at
each
other
for
a
second
then
they
both
burst
out
laughing
oh
yes
said
stanton
at
last
i
know
it
funny
that
just
the
trouble
with
it
it
altogether
too
funny
out
of
a
book
on
the
table
beside
him
he
drew
the
thin
gray
and
crimson
circular
of
the
and
handed
it
to
the
doctor
then
after
a
moment
rummaging
around
on
the
floor
beside
him
he
produced
with
some
difficulty
a
long
pasteboard
box
fairly
bulging
with
papers
and
things
these
are
the
communications
from
my
girl
he
confessed
grinningly
oh
of
course
they
not
all
letters
he
hurried
to
explain
here
a
book
on
south
i
a
rubber
broker
you
know
and
of
course
i
always
been
keen
enough
about
the
new
england
end
of
my
job
but
i
never
thought
anything
so
very
special
about
the
south
american
end
of
it
but
that
girl
that
girl
i
mean
insists
that
i
ought
to
know
all
about
south
america
so
she
sent
me
this
book
and
it
corking
reading
too
all
about
funny
things
like
eating
monkeys
and
parrots
and
toasted
and
sleeping
outdoors
in
black
under
mosquito
netting
mind
you
as
a
protection
against
prowling
and
here
a
queer
little
newspaper
cutting
that
she
sent
me
one
blizzardy
sunday
telling
all
about
some
big
violin
maker
who
always
went
out
into
the
forests
himself
and
chose
his
violin
woods
from
the
side
of
the
trees
casual
little
item
you
think
anything
about
it
at
the
moment
it
probably
is
true
and
to
save
your
soul
you
could
tell
what
kind
of
trees
violins
are
made
out
of
anyway
but
i
wager
that
never
again
will
you
wake
in
the
night
to
listen
to
the
wind
without
thinking
of
the
great
moaning
groaning
forest
trees
learning
to
be
violins
and
here
a
funny
little
old
silver
porringer
that
she
gave
me
she
says
to
make
my
gray
gruel
taste
shinier
and
down
at
the
bottom
of
the
bowl
the
ruthless
little
pirate
she
taken
a
knife
or
a
pin
or
something
and
scratched
the
words
child
but
you
know
i
never
noticed
that
part
of
it
at
all
till
last
week
you
see
i
only
been
eating
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
bowl
just
about
a
and
here
a
catalogue
of
a
boy
school
four
or
five
catalogues
in
fact
that
she
sent
me
one
evening
and
asked
me
if
i
please
would
look
them
over
right
away
and
help
her
decide
where
to
send
her
little
brother
why
man
it
took
me
almost
all
night
if
you
get
the
athletics
you
want
in
one
school
then
likelier
than
not
you
slip
up
on
the
manual
training
and
if
they
going
to
schedule
eight
hours
a
week
for
latin
why
where
in
creation
shrugging
his
shoulders
as
though
to
shrug
aside
absolutely
any
possible
further
responsibility
concerning
little
brother
stanton
began
to
dig
down
deeper
into
the
box
then
suddenly
all
the
grin
came
back
to
his
face
and
here
are
some
sample
wall
papers
that
she
sent
me
for
house
he
confided
flushing
what
do
you
think
of
that
bronze
one
there
with
the
peacock
feathers
say
old
man
think
of
a
library
and
a
cannel
coal
fire
and
a
big
mahogany
desk
and
a
girl
sitting
against
that
paper
and
this
tint
for
a
is
half
bad
is
it
oh
yes
and
here
are
the
and
all
the
pink
and
blue
maps
about
colorado
and
arizona
and
the
desert
if
we
can
it
she
writes
she
we
could
go
to
the
painted
desert
on
our
wedding
trip
but
really
old
man
you
know
it
is
such
a
frightfully
expensive
journey
why
if
you
leave
new
york
on
wednesday
oh
hang
it
all
what
the
use
of
showing
you
any
more
of
this
nonsense
he
finished
abruptly
with
brutal
haste
he
started
cramming
everything
back
into
place
it
is
nothing
but
nonsense
he
acknowledged
conscientiously
nothing
in
the
world
except
a
boxful
of
thoughts
from
a
girl
and
here
he
finished
resolutely
are
my
own
thoughts
concerning
me
out
of
his
pocket
he
produced
and
spread
out
before
the
doctor
eyes
five
thin
letters
and
a
not
exactly
thoughts
concerning
even
so
are
they
quizzed
the
doctor
stanton
began
to
grin
again
well
thoughts
concerning
the
weather
then
if
that
suits
you
any
better
twice
the
doctor
swallowed
audibly
then
but
it
hardly
fair
is
it
to
weigh
a
boxful
of
even
the
prettiest
lies
against
five
of
even
the
slimmest
real
true
letters
he
asked
drily
but
they
not
lies
snapped
stanton
surely
you
do
call
anything
a
lie
unless
not
only
the
fact
is
false
but
the
fancy
also
is
maliciously
distorted
now
take
this
case
right
before
us
suppose
there
is
any
brother
at
all
suppose
there
is
any
desert
suppose
there
is
any
sheep
up
on
a
grandfather
farm
suppose
there
is
suppose
i
say
that
every
single
individual
fact
stated
is
what
earthly
difference
does
it
make
so
long
as
the
still
remains
the
truest
realest
dearest
funniest
thing
that
ever
happened
to
a
fellow
in
his
life
oh
ho
said
the
doctor
so
that
the
trouble
is
it
it
is
just
rheumatism
that
keeping
you
thin
and
worried
looking
eh
it
only
that
you
find
yourself
suddenly
in
the
embarrassing
predicament
of
being
engaged
to
one
girl
and
in
love
with
another
n
o
cried
stanton
frantically
n
o
that
the
mischief
of
it
the
very
mischief
i
do
even
know
that
the
a
girl
why
it
might
be
an
old
lady
rather
whimsically
inclined
even
the
oldest
lady
i
presume
might
very
reasonably
perfume
her
with
cinnamon
roses
it
might
even
be
a
boy
one
letter
indeed
smelt
very
strongly
of
being
a
boy
and
mighty
good
tobacco
too
and
great
heavens
what
have
i
got
to
prove
that
it
is
even
an
old
man
some
poor
old
worn
out
trying
to
ease
out
the
ragged
end
of
his
years
illustration
some
poor
old
have
you
told
your
fiancée
about
it
asked
the
doctor
stanton
jaw
dropped
have
i
told
my
fiancée
about
it
he
mocked
why
it
was
she
who
sent
me
the
circular
in
the
first
place
but
her
about
it
why
man
in
ten
thousand
years
and
then
some
how
could
i
make
any
sane
person
understand
you
beginning
to
make
me
understand
confessed
the
doctor
then
you
no
longer
sane
scoffed
stanton
the
crazy
magic
of
it
has
surely
then
taken
possession
of
you
too
why
how
could
i
go
to
any
sane
person
like
cornelia
and
cornelia
is
the
most
absolutely
hopelessly
sane
person
you
ever
saw
in
your
life
how
could
i
go
to
anyone
like
that
and
announce
if
you
find
any
perplexing
change
in
me
during
your
absence
and
your
unconscious
neglect
it
is
only
that
i
have
fallen
quite
madly
in
love
with
a
person
would
you
call
it
a
person
who
does
even
exist
therefore
for
the
sake
of
this
who
does
exist
i
ask
to
be
released
oh
so
you
do
ask
to
be
released
interrupted
the
doctor
why
no
certainly
not
insisted
stanton
suppose
the
girl
you
love
does
hurt
your
feelings
a
little
bit
now
and
then
would
any
man
go
ahead
and
give
up
a
real
sweetheart
for
the
sake
of
even
the
most
wonderful
girl
whom
he
was
reading
about
in
an
unfinished
serial
story
would
he
i
say
would
he
said
the
doctor
soberly
i
think
he
would
if
what
you
call
the
girl
suggested
suddenly
an
entirely
new
vista
of
emotional
and
spiritual
satisfaction
but
i
tell
you
probably
a
boy
persisted
stanton
doggedly
well
why
do
you
go
ahead
and
find
out
quizzed
the
doctor
find
out
cried
stanton
hotly
find
out
i
like
to
know
how
anybody
is
going
to
find
out
when
the
only
given
address
is
a
private
box
and
as
far
as
i
know
there
no
sex
to
a
box
find
out
why
man
that
basket
over
there
is
full
of
my
letters
returned
to
me
because
i
tried
to
out
the
first
time
i
asked
they
answered
me
with
just
a
teasing
snubbing
telegram
but
ever
since
then
they
simply
sent
back
my
questions
with
a
stern
printed
slip
announcing
your
letter
of
is
hereby
returned
to
you
kindly
allow
us
to
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
we
are
not
running
a
correspondence
bureau
our
circular
distinctly
states
etc
sent
you
a
printed
slip
cried
the
doctor
scoffingly
the
business
must
be
thriving
very
evidently
you
are
by
no
means
the
only
importunate
subscriber
oh
thunder
growled
stanton
the
idea
seemed
to
be
new
to
him
and
not
altogether
to
his
taste
then
suddenly
his
face
began
to
brighten
no
i
lying
he
said
no
they
have
always
sent
me
a
printed
slip
it
was
only
yesterday
that
they
sent
me
a
rather
real
sort
of
letter
you
see
he
explained
i
got
pretty
mad
at
last
and
i
wrote
them
frankly
and
told
them
that
i
did
give
a
darn
who
was
but
simply
wanted
to
know
she
was
i
told
them
that
it
was
just
gratitude
on
my
part
the
most
formal
impersonal
sort
of
gratitude
a
perfectly
plausible
desire
to
say
you
to
some
one
who
had
been
awfully
decent
to
me
these
past
few
weeks
i
said
right
out
that
if
was
a
boy
why
we
surely
have
to
go
fishing
together
in
the
spring
and
if
was
an
old
man
the
very
least
i
could
do
would
be
to
endow
her
with
tobacco
and
if
was
an
old
lady
why
simply
be
obliged
to
drop
in
now
and
then
of
a
rainy
evening
and
hold
her
knitting
for
her
and
if
were
a
girl
probed
the
doctor
stanton
mouth
began
to
twitch
then
heaven
help
me
he
laughed
well
what
answer
did
you
get
persisted
the
doctor
what
do
you
call
a
realish
sort
of
letter
with
palpable
reluctance
stanton
drew
a
gray
envelope
out
of
the
cuff
of
his
wrapper
i
suppose
you
might
as
well
see
the
whole
business
he
admitted
consciously
there
was
no
special
diffidence
in
the
doctor
manner
this
time
his
clutch
on
the
letter
was
distinctly
inquisitive
and
he
read
out
the
opening
sentences
with
almost
rhetorical
effect
oh
carl
dear
you
silly
boy
why
do
you
persist
in
hectoring
me
so
do
you
understand
that
i
got
only
a
certain
amount
of
ingenuity
anyway
and
if
you
force
me
to
use
it
all
in
trying
to
conceal
my
identity
from
you
how
much
shall
i
possibly
have
left
to
devise
schemes
for
your
amusement
why
do
you
persist
for
instance
in
wanting
to
see
my
face
maybe
i
have
got
any
face
maybe
i
lost
my
face
in
a
railroad
accident
how
do
you
suppose
it
would
make
me
feel
then
to
have
you
keep
teasing
and
oh
carl
is
it
enough
for
me
just
to
tell
you
once
for
all
that
there
is
an
insuperable
obstacle
in
the
way
of
our
ever
meeting
maybe
i
got
a
husband
who
is
cruel
to
me
maybe
biggest
obstacle
of
all
i
got
a
husband
whom
i
am
utterly
devoted
to
maybe
instead
of
any
of
these
things
i
a
poor
old
tossing
day
and
night
on
a
very
small
bed
of
very
big
pain
maybe
worse
than
being
sick
i
starving
poor
and
maybe
worse
than
being
sick
or
poor
i
am
most
horribly
tired
of
myself
of
course
if
you
are
very
young
and
very
prancy
and
reasonably
and
still
are
tired
of
yourself
you
can
almost
always
rest
yourself
by
going
on
the
stage
where
with
a
little
rouge
and
a
different
colored
wig
and
a
new
nose
and
skirts
instead
of
trousers
or
trousers
instead
of
skirts
and
age
instead
of
youth
and
badness
instead
of
goodness
you
can
give
your
ego
a
perfectly
limitless
number
of
happy
holidays
but
if
you
were
oldish
i
say
and
pitifully
in
just
how
would
you
go
to
work
i
wonder
to
rest
your
personality
how
for
instance
could
you
take
your
biggest
grayest
oldest
worry
about
your
doctor
bill
and
rouge
it
up
into
a
radiant
young
joke
and
how
for
instance
out
of
your
lonely
dreary
orphanhood
are
you
going
to
find
a
way
to
your
rheumatic
pains
and
braid
into
two
perfectly
huge
pigtails
the
hair
that
you
and
caper
round
so
ecstatically
before
the
that
the
old
gentleman
and
lady
in
the
front
seat
absolutely
swear
you
to
be
the
living
image
of
their
lost
amy
and
how
if
the
farthest
journey
you
ever
will
take
again
is
the
monotonous
from
your
pillow
to
your
medicine
bottle
then
how
for
instance
with
map
or
tinsel
or
attar
of
roses
can
you
go
to
work
to
solve
even
just
for
your
own
satisfaction
the
romantic
shimmering
secrets
of
morocco
ah
you
got
me
now
you
think
all
decided
in
your
mind
that
i
am
an
aged
invalid
i
did
say
so
i
just
said
likelier
than
not
i
saved
my
climax
for
its
proper
place
how
do
you
know
for
instance
that
i
not
a
pusson
so
many
people
are
without
signature
of
any
sort
the
letter
ended
abruptly
then
and
there
and
as
though
to
satisfy
his
sense
of
something
left
unfinished
the
doctor
began
at
the
beginning
and
read
it
all
over
again
in
a
mumbling
husky
whisper
maybe
she
is
he
volunteered
at
last
very
likely
said
stanton
perfectly
cheerfully
it
just
those
occasional
humorous
suggestions
that
keep
me
keyed
so
heroically
up
to
the
point
where
i
actually
infuriated
if
you
even
suggest
that
i
might
be
getting
really
interested
in
this
mysterious
miss
molly
you
have
said
a
single
sentimental
thing
about
her
that
i
scoffed
at
now
have
you
n
o
acknowledged
the
doctor
i
can
see
that
you
covered
your
retreat
all
right
even
if
the
author
of
these
letters
should
turn
out
to
be
a
veteran
of
the
war
of
you
still
could
say
told
you
so
but
all
the
same
i
wager
that
you
gladly
give
a
hundred
dollars
cash
down
if
you
could
only
go
ahead
and
prove
the
little
girl
actual
existence
stanton
shoulders
squared
suddenly
but
his
mouth
retained
at
least
a
faint
vestige
of
its
original
smile
you
mistake
the
situation
entirely
he
said
it
the
little
that
i
am
most
anxious
to
prove
then
utterly
without
reproach
or
interference
he
reached
over
and
grabbed
a
forbidden
cigar
from
the
doctor
cigar
case
and
lighted
it
and
retreated
as
far
as
possible
into
the
gray
film
of
smoke
it
was
minutes
and
minutes
before
either
man
spoke
again
then
at
last
after
much
crossing
and
of
his
knees
the
doctor
asked
drawlingly
and
when
is
it
that
you
and
cornelia
are
planning
to
be
married
next
april
said
stanton
briefly
u
m
m
said
the
doctor
after
a
few
more
minutes
he
said
u
m
m
again
illustration
maybe
she
is
he
volunteered
at
last
the
second
u
m
m
seemed
to
irritate
stanton
unduly
is
it
your
head
that
spinning
round
he
asked
tersely
you
sound
like
a
dutch
top
the
doctor
raised
his
hands
cautiously
to
his
forehead
your
story
does
make
me
feel
a
little
bit
giddy
he
acknowledged
then
with
sudden
intensity
stanton
you
playing
a
dangerous
game
for
an
engaged
man
cut
it
out
i
say
cut
what
out
said
stanton
stubbornly
the
doctor
pointed
exasperatedly
towards
the
big
box
of
letters
cut
those
out
he
said
a
sentimental
correspondence
with
a
girl
who
more
interesting
than
your
fiancée
growled
stanton
i
hardly
stand
for
that
statement
well
then
lie
down
for
it
taunted
the
doctor
keep
right
on
being
sick
and
worried
and
peremptorily
he
reached
out
both
hands
towards
the
box
here
he
insisted
let
dump
the
whole
mischievous
nonsense
into
the
fire
and
burn
it
up
with
an
ouch
of
pain
stanton
knocked
the
doctor
hands
away
burn
up
my
letters
he
laughed
well
i
guess
not
i
would
even
burn
up
the
wall
papers
i
had
altogether
too
much
fun
out
of
them
and
as
for
the
books
the
browning
why
hang
it
all
i
gotten
awfully
fond
of
those
books
idly
he
picked
up
the
south
american
volume
and
opened
the
for
the
doctor
to
see
carl
from
his
molly
it
said
quite
distinctly
oh
yes
mumbled
the
doctor
it
looks
very
pleasant
there
absolutely
no
denying
that
it
looks
very
pleasant
and
some
day
out
of
an
old
trunk
or
tucked
down
behind
your
library
encyclopedias
your
wife
will
discover
the
book
and
ask
blandly
was
molly
i
do
remember
your
ever
saying
anything
about
a
molly
just
someone
you
used
to
know
and
your
answer
will
be
innocent
enough
dear
whom
i
never
but
how
about
the
pucker
along
your
spine
and
the
awfully
foolish
grinny
feeling
around
your
and
on
the
street
and
in
the
cars
and
at
the
theaters
you
always
and
forever
be
looking
and
searching
and
asking
yourself
it
by
any
chance
possible
that
this
girl
sitting
next
to
me
now
and
your
wife
will
keep
saying
with
just
a
barely
perceptible
edge
in
her
voice
do
you
know
that
girl
whom
we
just
passed
you
stared
at
her
so
and
you
say
no
i
was
merely
wondering
if
oh
yes
you
always
and
forever
be
if
and
mark
my
words
stanton
people
who
go
about
the
world
with
even
the
most
innocent
chronic
question
in
their
eyes
are
pretty
apt
to
run
up
against
an
unfortunately
large
number
of
wrong
answers
but
you
take
it
all
so
horribly
seriously
protested
stanton
why
you
rave
and
rant
about
it
as
though
it
was
actually
my
affections
that
were
involved
your
affections
cried
the
doctor
in
great
exasperation
your
affections
why
man
if
it
was
only
your
affections
do
you
suppose
be
wasting
even
so
much
as
half
a
minute
worry
on
you
but
it
your
that
involved
that
where
the
blooming
mischief
lies
affection
is
all
right
affection
is
nothing
but
a
nice
safe
flame
that
feeds
only
on
one
special
kind
of
fuel
its
own
particular
object
you
got
an
for
cornelia
and
wherever
cornelia
fails
to
feed
that
affection
it
is
mercifully
ordained
that
the
starved
flame
shall
go
out
into
cold
gray
ashes
without
making
any
further
trouble
whatsoever
but
you
got
an
for
this
girl
heaven
help
you
and
an
is
a
great
wild
seething
insatiate
tongue
of
fire
that
thwarted
once
and
for
all
in
its
original
desire
to
gorge
itself
with
realities
will
turn
upon
you
body
and
soul
and
lick
up
your
crackling
fancy
like
so
much
kindling
wood
and
sear
your
common
sense
and
scorch
your
young
wife
happiness
nothing
but
cornelia
herself
will
ever
make
you
want
cornelia
but
the
other
girl
the
unknown
girl
why
she
the
face
in
the
clouds
she
the
voice
in
the
sea
she
the
glow
of
the
sunset
she
the
hush
of
the
june
twilight
every
summer
breeze
every
winter
gale
will
fan
the
embers
every
thumping
twittering
twanging
pulse
of
an
orchestra
every
oh
stanton
i
say
it
is
the
ghost
of
the
things
that
are
dead
that
will
ever
come
between
you
and
cornelia
there
never
yet
was
the
ghost
of
any
lost
thing
that
could
be
tamed
into
a
purring
household
pet
but
the
ghost
of
a
thing
that
you
never
yet
found
i
tell
you
is
a
very
different
matter
pounding
at
his
heart
and
blazing
in
his
cheeks
the
insidious
argument
the
subtle
justification
that
had
been
teeming
in
veins
all
the
week
burst
suddenly
into
speech
but
i
gave
cornelia
the
to
be
the
world
to
me
he
protested
doggedly
and
she
did
seem
to
care
a
hang
about
it
great
scott
man
are
you
going
to
call
a
fellow
unfaithful
because
he
hikes
off
into
a
corner
now
and
then
and
reads
a
bit
of
browning
for
instance
all
to
himself
or
wanders
out
on
the
piazza
some
night
all
sole
alone
to
stare
at
the
stars
that
happen
to
bore
his
wife
to
extinction
but
you
never
be
able
to
read
browning
again
by
yourself
taunted
the
doctor
whether
you
buy
it
fresh
from
the
presses
or
borrow
it
stale
and
old
from
a
public
library
you
never
find
another
copy
as
long
as
you
live
that
does
smell
of
cinnamon
roses
and
as
to
or
any
other
weird
thing
that
your
wife
does
care
for
you
never
go
out
alone
any
more
into
dawns
or
darknesses
without
the
very
tingling
conscious
presence
of
a
wonder
whether
the
girl
have
cared
for
it
oh
shucks
said
stanton
then
suddenly
his
forehead
puckered
up
of
course
i
got
a
worry
he
acknowledged
frankly
any
got
a
worry
who
finds
himself
engaged
to
be
married
to
a
girl
who
is
keen
enough
about
it
to
want
to
be
all
the
world
to
him
but
i
do
know
that
even
the
most
worried
fellow
has
any
real
cause
to
be
scared
as
long
as
the
girl
in
question
still
remains
the
only
girl
on
the
face
of
the
earth
whom
he
wishes
like
him
well
enough
to
want
to
be
the
world
to
him
the
only
girl
scoffed
the
doctor
oh
you
all
right
stanton
i
like
you
and
all
that
but
i
mighty
glad
just
the
same
that
it
is
my
daughter
whom
you
going
to
marry
with
all
this
nonsense
lurking
in
the
background
cut
it
out
stanton
i
say
cut
it
out
cut
it
out
mused
stanton
somewhat
distrait
cut
it
out
what
molly
under
the
quick
jerk
of
his
knees
the
big
box
of
letters
and
papers
and
things
brimmed
over
in
rustling
froth
across
the
whole
surface
of
the
table
just
for
a
second
the
muscles
in
his
throat
tightened
a
trifle
then
suddenly
he
burst
out
laughing
wildly
uproariously
like
an
excited
boy
cut
it
out
he
cried
but
it
such
a
joke
ca
you
see
that
nothing
in
the
world
except
a
perfectly
delicious
perfectly
intangible
joke
u
m
m
reiterated
the
doctor
in
the
very
midst
of
his
reiteration
there
came
a
sharp
rap
at
the
door
and
in
answer
to
stanton
cheerful
permission
to
enter
the
delicious
intangible
joke
manifested
itself
abruptly
in
the
person
of
a
rather
small
feminine
figure
very
heavily
muffled
up
in
a
great
black
cloak
and
a
veil
that
shrouded
her
nose
and
chin
bluntly
like
the
nose
and
chin
of
a
face
only
half
hewed
out
as
yet
from
a
block
of
pink
granite
it
only
molly
explained
an
undeniably
sweet
little
alto
voice
am
i
interrupting
you
vii
jumping
to
his
feet
the
doctor
stood
staring
wildly
from
amazed
face
to
the
perfectly
calm
perfectly
accustomed
air
of
poise
that
characterized
every
movement
of
the
visitor
the
amazement
in
fact
never
wavered
for
a
second
from
stanton
visage
nor
the
supreme
serenity
from
the
lady
whole
attitude
but
across
the
doctor
startled
features
a
fearful
outraged
consciousness
of
having
been
deceived
warred
mightily
with
a
consciousness
of
unutterable
mirth
advancing
toward
the
fireplace
with
a
rather
hesitating
gait
the
little
visitor
attention
focused
suddenly
on
the
cluttered
table
and
she
cried
out
with
unmistakable
delight
why
what
are
you
people
doing
with
all
my
letters
and
things
then
climbing
up
on
the
sturdy
brass
fender
she
thrust
her
pink
impenetrable
features
right
into
the
scared
pallid
face
of
the
shabby
old
clock
and
announced
pointedly
it
almost
seven
and
i
can
stay
till
just
eight
when
she
turned
around
again
the
doctor
was
gone
with
a
tiny
shrug
of
her
shoulders
she
settled
herself
down
then
in
a
big
chair
before
the
fire
and
stretched
out
her
overshoed
toes
to
the
shining
edge
of
the
fender
as
far
as
any
apparent
was
concerned
she
might
just
as
well
have
been
all
alone
in
the
room
convulsed
with
amusement
yet
almost
paralyzed
by
a
certain
stubborn
dumb
sort
of
embarrassment
nothing
on
earth
could
have
forced
stanton
into
making
even
an
indefinite
speech
to
the
girl
until
she
had
made
at
least
one
perfectly
definite
and
reasonably
illuminating
sort
of
speech
to
him
biting
his
grinning
lips
into
as
straight
a
line
as
possible
he
gathered
up
the
scattered
pages
of
the
evening
paper
and
attacked
them
furiously
with
scowling
eyes
after
a
really
dreadful
interim
of
silence
the
mysterious
little
visitor
rose
in
a
gloomy
discouraged
kind
of
way
and
climbing
up
again
on
the
narrow
brass
fender
peered
once
more
into
the
face
of
the
clock
it
twenty
minutes
of
eight
now
she
announced
into
her
voice
crept
for
the
first
time
the
faintest
perceptible
suggestion
of
a
tremor
it
twenty
minutes
of
eight
now
and
i
got
to
leave
here
exactly
at
eight
twenty
minutes
is
a
rather
a
rather
stingy
little
bit
out
of
a
whole
lifetime
she
added
falteringly
then
and
then
only
did
stanton
nervousness
break
forth
suddenly
into
one
wild
uproarious
laugh
that
seemed
to
light
up
the
whole
dark
ominous
room
as
though
the
gray
sulky
smoldering
itself
had
exploded
into
iridescent
flame
chasing
close
behind
the
musical
contagion
of
his
deep
guffaws
followed
the
softer
gentler
giggle
of
the
dainty
lady
by
the
time
they
had
both
finished
laughing
it
was
fully
quarter
of
eight
but
you
see
it
was
just
this
way
explained
the
pleasant
little
voice
all
alto
notes
again
cautiously
a
slim
unringed
hand
burrowed
out
from
the
somber
folds
of
the
big
cloak
and
raised
the
pink
veil
as
much
as
half
an
inch
above
the
speech
line
you
see
it
was
just
this
way
you
paid
me
a
lot
of
money
all
in
advance
for
a
six
weeks
special
edition
de
luxe
serial
and
i
spent
your
money
the
day
i
got
it
and
worse
than
that
i
owed
it
long
before
i
even
got
it
and
worst
of
all
i
got
a
chance
now
to
go
home
for
all
the
rest
of
the
winter
no
i
do
mean
that
exactly
i
mean
i
found
a
chance
to
go
up
to
vermont
and
have
all
my
expenses
paid
just
for
reading
aloud
every
day
to
a
lady
who
is
so
awfully
deaf
but
you
see
i
still
owe
you
a
subscription
and
i
ca
refund
you
the
money
because
i
have
got
it
and
it
happens
that
i
ca
run
a
fancy
business
from
the
special
house
that
i
going
to
there
are
enough
resources
there
and
all
that
so
i
thought
that
perhaps
perhaps
considering
how
much
you
been
teasing
and
teasing
to
know
who
i
was
i
thought
that
perhaps
if
i
came
here
this
evening
and
let
you
really
see
me
that
maybe
you
know
maybe
not
positively
but
just
you
be
willing
to
call
that
equivalent
to
one
week
subscription
you
in
the
sharp
eagerness
of
her
question
she
turned
her
shrouded
face
to
stanton
curious
gaze
and
he
saw
the
little
nervous
mischievous
twitch
of
her
lips
at
the
edge
of
her
masking
pink
veil
resolve
itself
suddenly
into
a
whimper
of
real
pain
yet
so
vivid
were
the
lips
so
blissfully
youthfully
lusciously
carmine
that
every
single
individual
statement
she
made
seemed
only
like
a
festive
little
announcement
printed
in
red
ink
i
guess
i
not
a
very
good
business
manager
faltered
the
voice
with
incongruous
pathos
indeed
i
know
i
not
because
well
because
the
has
broke
bankrupt
is
it
that
you
really
say
with
a
little
mockingly
playful
imitation
of
a
stride
she
walked
the
first
two
fingers
of
her
right
hand
across
the
surface
of
the
table
to
stanton
discarded
supper
dishes
oh
please
may
i
have
that
piece
of
cold
toast
she
asked
plaintively
no
professional
actress
on
the
stage
could
have
spoken
the
words
more
deliciously
even
to
the
actual
crunching
of
the
toast
in
her
little
shining
white
teeth
she
sought
to
illustrate
as
fantastically
as
possible
the
ultimate
misery
of
a
bankrupt
person
starving
for
cold
toast
stanton
spontaneous
laughter
attested
his
full
appreciation
of
her
mimicry
but
i
tell
you
the
broke
she
persisted
a
trifle
wistfully
i
guess
i
guess
it
takes
a
man
to
really
run
a
business
with
any
sort
of
financial
success
you
see
a
man
never
puts
anything
except
his
head
into
his
business
and
of
course
if
you
only
put
your
head
into
it
then
you
go
right
along
giving
always
just
a
little
wee
bit
less
than
received
and
so
you
ca
help
sir
making
a
profit
why
people
would
think
you
were
plain
stark
crazy
if
you
gave
them
even
one
more
pair
of
poor
rubber
boots
than
they
paid
for
but
a
woman
well
you
see
my
little
business
was
a
sort
of
a
scheme
to
sell
sympathy
perfectly
good
sympathy
you
know
but
to
sell
it
to
people
who
really
needed
it
instead
of
giving
it
away
to
people
who
did
care
anything
about
it
at
all
and
you
have
to
run
that
sort
of
business
almost
entirely
with
your
heart
and
you
would
feel
decent
at
all
unless
you
delivered
to
everybody
just
a
little
tiny
bit
more
sympathy
than
he
paid
for
otherwise
you
see
you
would
be
delivering
perfectly
good
sympathy
so
that
why
you
understand
now
that
why
i
had
to
send
you
my
very
own
woolly
and
my
very
own
silver
porringer
and
my
very
own
that
i
fight
city
cats
with
because
you
see
i
had
to
use
every
single
cent
of
your
money
right
away
to
pay
for
the
things
that
i
already
bought
for
other
people
for
other
people
quizzed
stanton
a
bit
resentfully
oh
yes
acknowledged
the
girl
for
several
other
people
then
did
you
like
the
idea
of
the
nights
entertainment
she
asked
quite
abruptly
did
i
like
it
cried
stanton
did
i
it
with
a
little
shrugging
air
of
apology
the
girl
straightened
up
very
stiffly
in
her
chair
of
course
it
was
exactly
an
original
idea
she
explained
contritely
that
is
i
mean
not
original
for
you
you
see
really
a
little
club
of
mine
a
little
subscription
club
of
rheumatic
people
who
ca
sleep
and
i
go
every
night
in
the
week
an
hour
to
each
one
of
them
there
are
only
three
you
know
there
a
youngish
lady
in
boston
and
a
very
very
old
gentleman
out
in
brookline
and
the
tiniest
sort
of
a
poor
little
sick
girl
in
cambridge
sometimes
i
turn
up
just
at
and
jolly
them
along
a
bit
with
their
gruels
sometimes
i
do
get
around
till
ten
or
eleven
in
the
great
dark
from
two
to
three
in
the
morning
seems
to
be
the
cruelest
grayest
coldest
time
for
the
little
girl
in
cambridge
and
i
play
the
banjo
decently
well
you
know
and
sing
more
or
less
and
tell
stories
or
read
aloud
and
i
most
always
go
dressed
up
in
some
sort
of
a
fancy
costume
i
ca
seem
to
find
any
other
thing
to
do
that
astonishes
sick
people
so
much
and
makes
them
sit
up
so
bravely
and
look
so
shiny
and
really
it
is
such
dreadfully
hard
work
to
do
because
everything
fits
together
so
well
the
short
skirts
for
instance
that
turn
me
into
such
a
jolly
prattling
for
the
poor
old
gentleman
make
me
just
a
perfectly
rational
for
the
small
cambridge
girl
i
so
very
very
little
only
of
course
she
finished
wryly
only
of
course
it
costs
such
a
horrid
big
lot
for
costumes
and
carriages
and
things
that
me
as
the
boys
say
and
then
of
course
i
most
dreadfully
sleepy
all
the
day
times
when
i
ought
to
be
writing
nice
things
for
my
business
and
then
one
day
last
week
the
vivid
red
lips
twisted
oddly
at
one
corner
one
night
last
week
they
sent
me
word
from
cambridge
that
the
little
little
girl
was
going
to
die
and
was
calling
and
calling
for
the
squirrel
lady
so
i
hired
a
big
gray
squirrel
coat
from
a
furrier
whom
i
know
and
i
ripped
up
my
muff
and
made
me
the
very
best
sort
of
a
hot
gray
smothery
face
that
i
could
and
i
went
out
to
cambridge
and
sat
three
hours
on
the
footboard
of
a
bed
cracking
jokes
and
nuts
to
beguile
a
little
child
and
somehow
it
broke
my
heart
or
my
spirit
or
something
somehow
i
think
i
could
have
stood
it
better
with
my
own
skin
face
anyway
the
little
girl
does
need
me
any
more
anyway
it
does
matter
if
someone
did
need
me
i
tell
you
i
i
tell
you
i
have
got
one
single
solitary
more
thing
to
give
it
is
just
my
that
empty
it
my
head
that
spent
too
it
my
heart
that
altogether
stripped
going
to
run
away
yes
i
am
jumping
to
her
feet
she
stood
there
for
an
instant
all
out
of
breath
as
though
just
the
mere
fancy
thought
of
running
away
had
almost
exhausted
her
then
suddenly
she
began
to
laugh
i
so
tired
of
making
up
things
she
confessed
why
i
so
tired
of
making
up
grandfathers
i
so
tired
of
making
up
pirates
i
so
tired
of
lovers
that
i
actually
cherish
the
bill
collector
as
the
only
real
genuine
acquaintance
whom
i
have
in
boston
certainly
there
no
slightest
trace
of
pretence
about
him
excuse
me
for
being
so
flippant
she
added
soberly
but
you
see
i
got
any
sympathy
left
even
for
myself
but
for
heaven
sake
cried
stanton
why
do
you
let
somebody
help
you
why
do
you
let
me
oh
you
help
me
cried
the
little
voice
excitedly
oh
yes
indeed
you
can
help
me
that
why
i
came
here
this
evening
you
see
i
settled
up
now
with
every
one
of
my
creditors
except
you
and
the
youngish
boston
lady
and
i
on
my
way
to
her
house
now
we
reading
oriental
fairy
stories
together
truly
i
think
she
be
very
glad
indeed
to
release
me
from
my
contract
when
i
offer
her
my
coral
beads
instead
because
they
are
dreadfully
nice
beads
my
real
unpretended
grandfather
carved
them
for
me
himself
but
how
can
i
settle
with
you
i
have
got
anything
left
to
settle
with
and
it
might
be
months
and
months
before
i
could
refund
the
actual
cash
money
so
would
you
could
you
please
call
my
coming
here
this
evening
an
equivalent
to
one
week
subscription
illustration
oh
do
i
look
gorgeous
she
stammered
wriggling
out
of
the
cloak
and
veil
that
wrapped
her
like
a
chrysalis
she
emerged
suddenly
a
glimmering
shimmering
little
oriental
figure
of
satin
and
silver
and
haunting
sandalwood
a
veritable
little
incandescent
rainbow
of
spangled
moonlight
and
flaming
scarlet
and
dark
purple
shadows
great
heavy
curls
caught
back
from
her
small
piquant
face
by
a
blazing
rhinestone
fillet
cheeks
just
a
tiny
bit
with
rouge
and
excitement
big
eyes
packed
full
of
high
lights
like
a
startled
fawn
bold
in
the
utter
security
of
her
masquerade
yet
scared
almost
to
death
by
the
persistent
underlying
of
her
unescapable
altogether
as
tantalizing
altogether
as
unreal
as
a
vision
out
of
the
arabian
nights
she
stood
there
staring
quizzically
at
stanton
you
call
it
an
equivalent
you
she
asked
nervously
then
pirouetting
over
to
the
largest
mirror
in
sight
she
began
to
smooth
and
twist
her
silken
sash
into
place
somewhere
at
wrist
or
ankle
twittered
the
jingle
of
innumerable
bangles
oh
do
i
look
gorgeous
she
stammered
o
h
h
viii
everything
that
was
discreet
and
in
conservative
exploded
suddenly
into
one
utterly
irresponsible
speech
you
little
witch
he
cried
out
you
little
beauty
for
sake
come
over
here
and
sit
down
in
this
chair
where
i
can
look
at
you
i
want
to
talk
to
you
i
pirouetting
once
more
before
the
mirror
she
divided
one
fleet
glance
between
admiration
for
herself
and
scorn
for
stanton
oh
yes
i
felt
perfectly
sure
that
you
insist
upon
having
me
she
announced
sternly
then
courtesying
low
to
the
ground
in
mock
humility
she
began
to
mischievously
so
molly
molly
made
it
of
rouge
and
made
it
of
lace
long
as
the
rouge
and
the
lace
are
fair
oh
man
what
do
you
care
you
do
need
any
rouge
or
lace
to
make
pretty
stanton
fairly
shouted
in
his
vehemence
anybody
might
have
known
that
that
lovely
little
mind
of
yours
could
only
live
in
a
nonsense
the
girl
interrupted
almost
temperishly
then
with
a
quick
impatient
sort
of
gesture
she
turned
to
the
table
and
picking
up
book
after
book
opened
it
and
stared
in
it
as
though
it
had
been
a
mirror
oh
maybe
my
mind
is
pretty
enough
she
acknowledged
reluctantly
but
likelier
than
not
my
face
is
not
becoming
to
me
crossing
slowly
over
to
stanton
side
she
seated
herself
with
much
jingling
dignity
in
the
chair
that
the
doctor
had
just
vacated
poor
dear
you
been
pretty
sick
have
you
she
mused
gently
cautiously
then
she
reached
out
and
touched
the
soft
woolly
cuff
of
his
did
you
really
like
it
she
asked
stanton
began
to
smile
again
did
i
really
like
it
he
repeated
joyously
why
do
you
know
that
if
it
had
been
for
you
i
should
have
gone
utterly
mad
these
past
few
weeks
do
you
know
that
if
it
had
been
for
you
do
you
know
that
if
a
little
he
clutched
at
the
tinsel
fringe
on
the
oriental
lady
fan
you
know
do
you
know
that
i
engaged
to
be
married
he
finished
weakly
the
oriental
lady
shivered
suddenly
as
any
lady
might
shiver
on
a
november
night
in
thin
silken
clothes
engaged
to
be
married
she
stammered
oh
yes
why
of
course
most
men
are
really
unless
you
catch
a
man
very
young
and
keep
him
absolutely
constantly
by
your
side
you
can
not
hope
to
walk
even
into
his
friendship
except
across
the
heart
of
some
other
woman
again
she
shivered
and
jingled
a
hundred
merry
little
bangles
but
why
she
asked
abruptly
why
if
you
engaged
to
be
married
did
you
come
and
buy
of
me
my
are
distinctly
for
lonely
people
she
added
severely
how
dared
you
how
dared
you
go
into
the
business
in
the
first
place
quizzed
stanton
dryly
and
when
it
comes
to
asking
personal
questions
how
dared
you
send
me
printed
slips
in
answer
to
my
letters
to
you
printed
slips
mind
you
how
many
men
are
you
writing
to
anyway
the
oriental
lady
threw
out
her
small
hands
deprecatingly
how
many
men
only
two
besides
yourself
there
such
a
fad
for
nature
study
these
days
that
almost
everybody
this
year
has
ordered
the
squirrel
series
but
i
doing
one
or
two
fairies
for
sick
children
and
a
high
school
history
class
out
in
omaha
has
ordered
a
weekly
epistle
from
william
of
orange
hang
the
high
school
class
out
in
omaha
said
stanton
it
was
the
that
i
was
asking
about
oh
yes
i
forgot
murmured
the
oriental
lady
just
two
men
besides
yourself
i
said
did
i
well
one
of
them
is
a
life
convict
out
in
an
illinois
prison
he
subscribed
for
a
whole
year
for
a
fortnightly
letter
from
a
girl
in
killarney
who
has
got
to
be
named
he
a
very
very
old
man
i
think
but
i
do
even
know
his
name
he
only
a
number
now
or
something
like
that
and
i
have
to
send
all
my
letters
over
to
killarney
to
be
mailed
oh
he
awfully
particular
about
that
and
it
was
pretty
hard
at
first
working
up
all
the
geography
that
he
knew
and
i
did
but
pshaw
you
not
interested
in
killarney
then
there
a
new
york
boy
down
in
ceylon
on
a
smelly
old
tea
plantation
his
people
have
dropped
him
i
guess
for
some
reason
or
other
so
i
just
girl
from
home
to
him
and
i
prattle
to
him
every
month
or
so
about
the
things
he
used
to
care
about
it
easy
enough
to
work
that
up
from
the
social
columns
in
the
new
york
papers
and
twice
i
been
over
to
new
york
to
get
special
details
for
him
once
to
find
out
if
his
mother
was
really
as
sick
as
the
sunday
paper
said
and
once
yes
really
once
i
butted
in
to
a
tea
his
sister
was
giving
and
wrote
him
yes
wrote
him
all
about
how
the
moths
were
eating
up
the
big
in
his
own
front
hall
and
he
sent
an
awfully
funny
nice
letter
of
thanks
to
the
yes
he
did
and
then
there
a
crippled
french
girl
out
in
the
berkshires
who
is
utterly
crazy
it
seems
about
the
musketeers
so
i
to
her
and
it
dreadfully
hard
work
in
french
but
i
learning
a
lot
out
of
that
and
there
do
tell
me
any
more
cried
stanton
then
suddenly
the
pulses
in
his
temples
began
to
pound
so
hard
and
so
loud
that
he
could
not
seem
to
estimate
at
all
just
how
loud
he
was
speaking
who
are
you
he
insisted
who
are
you
tell
me
instantly
i
say
are
you
anyway
the
oriental
lady
jumped
up
in
alarm
i
no
one
at
all
to
you
she
said
coolly
except
just
molly
something
in
her
tone
seemed
to
fairly
madden
stanton
you
shall
tell
me
who
you
are
he
cried
you
shall
i
say
you
shall
plunging
forward
he
grabbed
at
her
little
bangled
wrists
and
held
them
in
a
vise
that
sent
the
rheumatic
pains
shooting
up
his
arms
to
add
even
further
frenzy
to
his
brain
tell
me
who
you
are
he
grinned
you
sha
go
out
of
here
in
ten
thousand
years
till
you
told
me
who
you
are
frightened
infuriated
quivering
with
astonishment
the
girl
stood
trying
to
wrench
her
little
wrists
out
of
his
mighty
grasp
stamping
in
perfectly
impotent
rage
all
the
while
with
her
jingling
feet
i
wo
tell
you
who
i
am
i
wo
i
wo
she
swore
and
reswore
in
a
dozen
different
staccato
accents
the
whole
daring
passion
of
the
orient
that
costumed
her
seemed
to
have
permeated
every
fiber
of
her
small
being
then
suddenly
she
drew
in
her
breath
in
a
long
quivering
sigh
staring
up
into
her
face
stanton
gave
a
little
groan
of
dismay
and
released
her
hands
why
molly
molly
you
crying
he
whispered
why
little
girl
why
backing
slowly
away
from
him
she
made
a
desperate
effort
to
smile
through
her
tears
now
you
spoiled
everything
she
said
oh
no
not
everything
argued
stanton
helplessly
from
his
chair
afraid
to
rise
to
his
feet
afraid
even
to
shuffle
his
slippers
on
the
floor
lest
the
slightest
suspicion
of
vehemence
on
his
part
should
hasten
that
steady
backward
retreat
of
hers
towards
the
door
already
she
had
her
cloak
and
overshoes
and
was
groping
out
somewhat
blindly
for
her
veil
in
a
frantic
effort
to
avoid
any
possible
chance
of
turning
her
back
even
for
a
second
on
so
dangerous
a
person
as
himself
yes
everything
nodded
the
small
grieved
face
yet
the
tragic
snuffling
little
sob
that
accompanied
the
words
only
served
to
add
a
most
entrancing
vivacity
to
the
statement
oh
of
course
i
know
she
added
hastily
oh
of
course
i
know
perfectly
well
that
i
ought
to
have
come
alone
to
your
rooms
like
this
madly
she
began
to
wind
the
pink
veil
round
and
round
and
round
her
cheeks
like
a
bandage
oh
of
course
i
know
perfectly
well
that
it
was
even
remotely
proper
but
do
you
think
do
you
think
that
if
you
always
been
awfully
awfully
strict
and
particular
with
yourself
about
things
all
your
life
that
you
might
have
risked
safely
just
one
little
innocent
mischievous
sort
of
a
half
hour
especially
if
it
was
the
only
possible
way
you
could
think
of
to
square
up
everything
and
add
just
a
little
wee
present
besides
nothing
you
know
that
you
can
to
give
ever
seems
exactly
like
giving
a
really
truly
present
it
got
to
hurt
you
somewhere
to
be
a
so
my
coming
here
this
evening
this
way
was
altogether
the
bravest
scariest
unwisest
that
i
could
possibly
think
of
to
do
for
you
and
even
if
you
had
spoiled
everything
i
was
going
away
just
the
same
forever
and
ever
and
ever
cautiously
she
perched
herself
on
the
edge
of
a
chair
and
thrust
her
narrow
toes
into
the
wide
blunt
depths
of
her
overshoes
forever
and
ever
she
insisted
almost
gloatingly
not
forever
and
protested
stanton
vigorously
you
think
for
a
moment
do
you
that
after
all
this
wonderful
jolly
friendship
of
ours
you
going
to
drop
right
out
of
sight
as
though
the
earth
had
opened
even
the
little
quick
forward
lurch
of
his
shoulders
in
the
chair
sent
the
girl
scuttling
to
her
feet
again
one
overshoe
still
in
her
hand
just
at
the
edge
of
the
she
turned
and
smiled
at
him
mockingly
really
it
had
been
a
long
time
since
she
had
smiled
surely
you
do
think
that
you
be
able
to
recognize
me
in
my
street
clothes
do
you
she
asked
bluntly
stanton
answering
smile
was
quite
as
mocking
as
hers
why
not
he
queried
did
i
have
the
pleasure
of
choosing
your
winter
hat
for
you
let
me
see
it
was
brown
with
a
pink
rose
was
it
i
should
know
it
among
a
million
with
a
little
shrug
of
her
shoulders
she
leaned
back
against
the
door
and
stared
at
him
suddenly
out
of
her
big
eyes
with
singular
intentness
well
you
call
it
an
equivalent
to
one
week
subscription
she
asked
very
gravely
some
devil
of
mischief
awoke
in
stanton
senses
equivalent
to
one
whole
week
subscription
he
repeated
with
mock
incredulity
a
whole
week
seven
days
and
nights
oh
no
no
no
i
do
think
you
given
me
yet
more
than
about
four
days
worth
to
think
about
just
about
four
days
worth
i
should
think
pushing
the
pink
veil
further
and
further
back
from
her
features
with
plainly
quivering
hands
the
girl
whole
soul
seemed
to
blaze
out
at
him
suddenly
and
then
wince
back
again
then
just
as
quickly
a
droll
little
gleam
of
malice
glinted
in
her
eyes
oh
all
right
then
she
smiled
if
you
really
think
i
given
you
only
four
days
and
nights
worth
of
thoughts
here
something
for
the
fifth
day
and
night
very
casually
yet
still
very
accurately
her
right
hand
reached
out
to
the
knob
of
the
door
to
cancel
my
debt
for
the
fifth
day
she
said
do
you
really
want
to
know
who
i
am
i
tell
you
first
seen
me
before
what
cried
stanton
plunging
forward
in
his
chair
something
in
the
girl
quick
clutch
of
the
warned
him
quite
distinctly
to
relax
again
into
his
cushions
yes
she
repeated
triumphantly
and
you
talked
with
me
too
as
often
as
twice
and
moreover
you
danced
with
me
tossing
her
head
with
daring
she
reached
up
and
snatched
off
her
curly
black
wig
and
shook
down
all
around
her
such
a
great
shining
utterly
glorious
mass
of
mahogany
colored
hair
that
astonishment
turned
almost
into
faintness
what
he
cried
out
what
you
say
i
seen
you
before
talked
with
you
waltzed
with
you
perhaps
never
i
have
i
tell
you
i
have
i
never
saw
that
hair
before
if
i
had
i
should
have
forgotten
it
to
my
dying
day
why
with
a
little
wail
of
despair
she
leaned
back
against
the
door
you
do
even
remember
me
she
mourned
oh
dear
dear
dear
and
i
thought
were
so
beautiful
then
her
whole
sympathy
rushed
to
defend
him
from
her
own
accusations
oh
well
it
was
at
a
masquerade
party
she
acknowledged
generously
and
i
suppose
you
go
to
a
great
many
masquerades
heaping
up
her
hair
like
so
much
molten
copper
into
the
hood
of
her
cloak
and
trying
desperately
to
snare
all
the
wild
escaping
tendrils
with
the
softer
mesh
of
her
veil
she
reached
out
a
free
hand
at
last
and
opened
the
door
just
a
crack
and
to
give
you
something
to
think
about
for
the
sixth
day
and
night
she
resumed
suddenly
with
the
same
strange
little
glint
in
her
eyes
to
give
you
something
to
think
about
the
sixth
day
tell
you
that
i
really
was
hungry
when
i
asked
you
for
your
toast
i
have
had
anything
to
eat
and
illustration
what
cried
stanton
plunging
forward
in
his
chair
before
she
could
finish
the
sentence
stanton
had
sprung
from
his
chair
and
stood
trying
to
reason
out
madly
whether
one
single
more
stride
would
catch
her
or
lose
her
and
as
for
something
for
you
to
think
about
the
seventh
day
and
night
she
gasped
hurriedly
already
the
door
had
opened
to
her
hand
and
her
little
figure
stood
silhouetted
darkly
against
the
bright
hallway
here
something
for
you
to
think
about
for
days
and
nights
wildly
her
little
hands
went
clutching
at
the
woodwork
i
did
know
you
were
engaged
to
be
married
she
cried
out
passionately
and
i
you
you
you
then
in
a
flash
she
was
gone
ix
with
absolute
finality
the
big
door
banged
behind
her
a
minute
later
the
street
door
four
flights
down
rang
out
in
jarring
reverberation
a
minute
after
that
it
seemed
as
though
every
door
in
every
house
on
the
street
slammed
shrilly
then
the
charred
sagged
down
into
the
ashes
with
a
sad
puffing
sigh
then
a
whole
row
of
books
on
a
loosely
packed
shelf
toppled
over
on
each
other
with
soft
jocose
slaps
crawling
back
into
his
morris
chair
with
every
bone
in
his
body
aching
like
a
magnetized
charged
with
pain
stanton
collapsed
again
into
his
pillows
and
sat
staring
staring
into
the
dying
fire
nine
rang
out
dully
from
the
nearest
church
spire
ten
eleven
followed
in
turn
with
monotonous
chiming
insistency
gradually
the
relaxing
began
to
grunt
and
grumble
into
a
chill
quietude
gradually
along
the
bare
bleak
stretches
of
unrugged
floor
little
cold
draughts
of
air
came
creeping
exploringly
to
his
feet
and
still
he
sat
staring
staring
into
the
fast
graying
ashes
oh
glory
glory
he
said
think
what
it
would
mean
if
all
that
wonderful
imagination
were
turned
loose
upon
just
one
fellow
even
if
she
did
love
you
think
how
she
play
the
game
and
if
she
did
love
you
oh
lordy
lordy
lordy
towards
midnight
to
ease
the
melancholy
smell
of
the
dying
lamp
he
drew
reluctantly
forth
from
his
deepest
pocket
the
little
knotted
handkerchief
that
encased
the
handful
of
fragrant
and
bending
groaningly
forward
in
his
chair
sifted
the
brittle
pungent
needles
into
the
face
of
the
one
glowing
ember
that
survived
instantly
in
a
single
dazzling
flash
of
flame
the
tangible
forest
symbol
vanished
in
intangible
fragrance
but
along
the
hollow
of
his
hand
across
the
edge
of
his
sleeve
up
from
the
ragged
pile
of
books
and
papers
out
from
the
farthest
remotest
corners
of
the
room
lurked
the
unutterable
undestroyable
sweetness
of
all
forests
since
the
world
was
made
almost
with
a
sob
in
his
throat
stanton
turned
again
to
the
box
of
letters
on
his
table
by
dawn
the
feverish
excited
sleeplessness
in
his
brain
had
driven
him
on
and
on
to
one
last
supremely
fantastic
impulse
writing
to
cornelia
he
told
her
bluntly
frankly
dear
cornelia
when
i
asked
you
to
marry
me
you
made
me
promise
very
solemnly
at
the
time
that
if
i
ever
changed
my
mind
regarding
you
i
would
surely
tell
you
and
i
laughed
at
you
do
you
remember
but
you
were
right
it
seems
and
i
was
wrong
for
i
believe
that
i
have
changed
my
mind
that
is
i
do
know
how
to
express
it
exactly
but
it
has
been
made
very
very
plain
to
me
lately
that
i
do
not
by
any
manner
of
means
love
you
as
little
as
you
need
to
be
loved
in
all
sincerity
carl
to
which
surprising
communication
cornelia
answered
immediately
but
the
involved
a
week
almost
maddening
interim
dear
carl
neither
mother
nor
i
can
make
any
sense
whatsoever
out
of
your
note
by
any
possible
chance
was
it
meant
to
be
a
joke
you
say
you
do
not
love
me
little
as
i
need
to
be
loved
you
mean
much
do
you
carl
what
do
you
mean
laboriously
with
the
full
prospect
of
yet
another
week
agonizing
strain
and
suspense
stanton
wrote
again
to
cornelia
dear
cornelia
no
i
meant
little
as
you
need
to
be
loved
i
have
no
adequate
explanation
to
make
i
have
no
adequate
apology
to
offer
i
do
think
anything
i
do
hope
anything
all
i
know
is
that
i
suddenly
believe
positively
that
our
engagement
is
a
mistake
certainly
i
am
neither
giving
you
all
that
i
am
capable
of
giving
you
nor
yet
receiving
from
you
all
that
i
am
capable
of
receiving
just
this
fact
should
decide
the
matter
i
think
carl
cornelia
did
not
wait
to
write
an
answer
to
this
she
telegraphed
instead
the
message
even
in
the
telegraph
operator
handwriting
looked
a
little
nervous
do
you
mean
that
you
are
tired
of
it
she
asked
quite
boldly
with
miserable
perplexity
stanton
wired
back
no
i
could
exactly
say
that
i
was
tired
of
it
cornelia
answer
to
that
was
fluttering
in
his
hands
within
twelve
hours
do
you
mean
that
there
is
someone
else
the
words
fairly
ticked
themselves
off
the
yellow
page
it
was
hours
before
stanton
made
up
his
mind
just
what
to
reply
then
no
i
could
exactly
say
there
is
anybody
else
he
confessed
wretchedly
cornelia
mother
answered
this
time
the
telegram
fairly
rustled
with
sarcasm
you
do
seem
to
be
very
sure
about
anything
said
cornelia
mother
somehow
these
words
brought
the
first
cheerful
smile
to
his
lips
no
you
quite
right
i
not
at
all
sure
about
anything
he
wired
almost
gleefully
in
return
wiping
his
pen
with
delicious
joy
on
the
edge
of
the
clean
white
then
because
it
is
really
very
dangerous
for
people
to
try
to
make
any
noise
like
laughter
a
great
choking
bitter
sob
caught
him
up
suddenly
and
sent
his
face
burrowing
down
like
a
child
into
the
safe
soft
feathery
depths
of
his
pillow
where
with
his
knuckles
ground
so
hard
into
his
eyes
that
all
his
tears
were
turned
to
stars
there
came
to
him
very
very
slowly
so
slowly
in
fact
that
it
did
not
alarm
him
at
all
the
strange
electrifying
vision
of
the
one
fact
on
earth
that
he
sure
of
a
little
keen
luminous
face
with
a
look
in
it
and
a
look
for
him
only
so
help
him
god
such
as
he
had
never
seen
on
the
face
of
any
other
woman
since
the
world
was
made
was
it
possible
was
it
really
possible
suddenly
his
whole
heart
seemed
to
irradiate
light
and
color
and
music
and
sweet
smelling
things
illustration
cornelia
mother
answered
this
time
oh
molly
molly
molly
he
shouted
i
want
i
want
in
the
strange
lonesome
days
that
followed
neither
burly
doctor
nor
slim
paper
sweetheart
tramped
noisily
over
the
threshold
or
slid
thuddingly
through
the
no
one
apparently
was
ever
coming
to
see
stanton
again
unless
actually
compelled
to
do
so
even
the
laundryman
seemed
to
have
skipped
his
usual
day
and
twice
in
succession
the
morning
paper
had
most
annoyingly
failed
to
appear
certainly
neither
the
boldest
private
inquiry
nor
the
most
delicately
worded
public
advertisement
had
proved
able
to
discover
the
whereabouts
of
molly
much
less
succeeded
in
bringing
her
back
but
the
doctor
at
least
could
be
summoned
by
ordinary
telephone
and
cornelia
and
her
mother
would
surely
be
moving
north
eventually
whether
stanton
last
message
hastened
their
movements
or
not
in
subsequent
experience
it
seemed
to
take
two
telephone
messages
to
produce
the
doctor
a
trifle
coolly
a
trifle
distantly
more
than
a
trifle
disapprovingly
he
appeared
at
last
and
stared
dully
at
stanton
astonishing
progress
towards
health
always
glad
to
serve
you
professionally
murmured
the
doctor
with
an
undeniably
definite
accent
on
the
word
oh
cut
it
out
quoted
stanton
emphatically
what
in
creation
are
you
so
stuffy
about
well
really
growled
the
doctor
considering
the
deception
you
practised
on
me
considering
nothing
shouted
stanton
on
my
word
of
honor
i
tell
you
i
never
consciously
in
all
my
life
before
ever
ever
set
eyes
upon
that
wonderful
little
girl
until
that
evening
i
never
knew
that
she
even
existed
i
never
knew
i
tell
you
i
never
knew
as
limply
as
any
stout
man
could
sink
into
a
chair
the
doctor
sank
into
the
seat
nearest
him
tell
me
instantly
all
about
it
he
gasped
there
are
only
two
things
to
tell
said
stanton
quite
blithely
and
the
first
thing
is
what
i
already
stated
on
my
honor
that
the
evening
we
speak
of
was
actually
and
positively
the
first
time
i
ever
saw
the
girl
and
the
second
thing
is
that
equally
upon
my
honor
i
do
not
intend
to
let
it
remain
the
last
time
but
cornelia
cried
the
doctor
what
about
cornelia
almost
half
the
sparkle
faded
from
stanton
eyes
cornelia
and
i
have
annulled
our
engagement
he
said
very
quietly
then
with
more
vehemence
oh
you
old
do
you
worry
about
cornelia
i
look
out
for
cornelia
cornelia
is
going
to
get
hurt
i
tell
you
i
figured
and
reasoned
it
all
out
very
very
carefully
and
i
can
see
now
quite
plainly
that
cornelia
never
really
loved
me
at
all
else
she
would
have
dropped
me
so
accidentally
through
her
fingers
why
there
never
was
even
the
ghost
of
a
clutch
in
cornelia
fingers
but
you
loved
persisted
the
doctor
scowlingly
it
was
hard
just
that
second
for
stanton
to
lift
his
troubled
eyes
to
the
doctor
face
but
he
did
lift
them
and
he
lifted
them
very
squarely
and
steadily
yes
i
think
i
did
love
cornelia
he
acknowledged
frankly
the
very
first
time
that
i
saw
her
i
said
to
myself
is
the
end
of
my
journey
but
i
seem
to
have
found
out
suddenly
that
the
mere
fact
of
loving
a
woman
does
not
necessarily
prove
her
that
much
coveted
end
i
do
know
exactly
how
to
express
it
indeed
i
feel
beastly
clumsy
about
expressing
it
but
somehow
it
seems
as
though
it
were
cornelia
herself
who
had
proved
herself
perfectly
amiably
no
end
after
all
but
only
a
way
station
not
equipped
to
receive
my
particular
kind
of
a
permanent
guest
it
is
that
i
wanted
any
grand
fixings
oh
ca
you
understand
that
i
not
finding
any
fault
with
cornelia
there
never
was
any
slightest
pretence
about
cornelia
she
never
never
even
in
the
first
place
made
any
possible
effort
to
attract
me
ca
you
see
that
cornelia
to
me
exactly
the
way
that
she
looked
to
me
in
the
first
place
very
amazingly
beautiful
but
a
traveler
you
know
can
not
dally
indefinitely
to
feed
his
eyes
on
even
the
most
wonderful
view
while
all
his
precious
lifelong
companions
his
whims
his
hobbies
his
cravings
his
yearnings
are
crouching
starved
and
unwelcome
outside
the
door
and
i
ca
even
flatter
myself
he
added
wryly
i
ca
even
flatter
myself
that
my
going
is
going
to
inconvenience
cornelia
in
the
slightest
because
i
ca
see
that
my
coming
has
made
even
the
remotest
perceptible
difference
in
her
daily
routine
anyway
he
finished
more
lightly
when
you
come
right
down
to
or
or
or
whatever
you
choose
to
call
it
it
seems
to
be
written
in
the
stars
that
plans
or
no
plans
preferences
or
no
preferences
initiatives
or
no
initiatives
we
belong
to
those
and
to
those
only
hang
it
all
who
happen
to
love
most
fairly
jumping
from
his
chair
the
doctor
snatched
hold
of
shoulder
who
happen
to
love
most
he
repeated
wildly
love
for
heaven
sake
who
loving
you
utterly
irrelevantly
stanton
brushed
him
aside
and
began
to
rummage
anxiously
among
the
books
on
his
table
do
you
know
much
about
vermont
he
asked
suddenly
it
funny
but
almost
nobody
seems
to
know
anything
about
vermont
it
a
darned
good
state
too
and
i
ca
imagine
why
all
the
geographies
neglect
it
so
idly
his
finger
seemed
to
catch
in
a
half
open
pamphlet
and
he
bent
down
casually
to
straighten
out
the
page
area
in
square
miles
he
read
aloud
musingly
principal
products
hay
oats
suddenly
he
threw
down
the
pamphlet
and
flung
himself
into
the
nearest
chair
and
began
to
laugh
he
ejaculated
oh
glory
and
i
suppose
there
are
some
people
who
think
that
is
the
sweetest
thing
that
ever
came
out
of
vermont
the
doctor
started
to
give
him
some
fresh
advice
but
left
him
a
bromide
instead
x
though
the
ensuing
interview
with
cornelia
and
her
mother
began
quite
as
coolly
as
the
interview
with
the
doctor
it
did
not
happen
to
end
even
in
hysterical
laughter
it
was
just
two
days
after
the
doctor
hurried
exit
that
stanton
received
a
formal
starchy
little
note
from
cornelia
mother
notifying
him
of
their
return
except
for
an
experimental
somewhat
journey
or
two
to
the
edge
of
the
public
garden
he
had
made
no
attempts
as
yet
to
resume
any
outdoor
life
yet
for
sundry
personal
reasons
of
his
own
he
did
not
feel
to
postpone
the
necessary
meeting
in
the
immediate
emergency
at
hand
strong
courage
was
infinitely
more
of
an
asset
than
strong
knees
filling
his
suitcase
at
once
with
all
the
explanatory
evidence
that
he
could
carry
he
proceeded
on
to
cornelia
grimly
dignified
residence
the
street
lamps
were
just
beginning
to
be
lighted
when
he
arrived
as
the
butler
ushered
him
gravely
into
the
beautiful
drawing
room
he
realized
with
a
horrid
sinking
of
the
heart
that
cornelia
and
her
mother
were
already
sitting
there
waiting
for
him
with
a
dreadful
tight
lipped
expression
on
their
faces
which
seemed
to
suggest
that
though
he
was
already
fifteen
minutes
ahead
of
his
appointment
they
had
been
waiting
for
him
there
since
early
dawn
the
drawing
room
itself
was
deliciously
familiar
to
him
green
carpeted
shining
with
heavy
gilt
picture
frames
and
prismatic
chandeliers
often
with
posies
and
candies
and
he
had
strutted
across
that
erstwhile
magic
threshold
and
fairly
lolled
in
the
big
chairs
while
waiting
for
the
advent
of
the
ladies
but
now
with
his
suitcase
clutched
in
his
hand
no
armenian
peddler
of
laces
and
ointments
could
have
felt
more
grotesquely
out
of
his
element
indolently
cornelia
mother
lifted
her
lorgnette
and
gazed
at
him
skeptically
from
the
spot
just
behind
his
left
ear
where
the
barber
had
clipped
him
too
short
to
the
edge
of
his
right
heel
that
the
bootblack
had
neglected
to
polish
apparently
she
did
not
even
see
the
suitcase
but
oh
are
you
leaving
town
she
asked
icily
only
by
the
utmost
tact
on
his
part
did
he
finally
succeed
in
establishing
relations
with
cornelia
herself
and
even
then
if
the
house
had
been
a
tower
ten
stories
high
mother
rustling
up
the
stairs
could
not
have
swished
her
skirts
any
more
definitely
like
a
hissing
snake
in
absolute
dumbness
stanton
and
cornelia
sat
listening
until
the
horrid
sound
died
away
then
and
then
only
did
cornelia
cross
the
room
to
stanton
side
and
proffer
him
her
hand
the
hand
was
very
cold
and
the
manner
of
offering
it
was
very
cold
but
stanton
was
quite
man
enough
to
realize
that
this
special
temperature
was
purely
a
matter
of
physical
nervousness
rather
than
of
mental
intention
slipping
naturally
into
the
most
conventional
groove
either
of
word
or
deed
cornelia
eyed
the
suitcase
inquisitively
what
are
you
doing
she
asked
thoughtlessly
returning
my
presents
you
never
gave
me
any
presents
said
stanton
cheerfully
why
did
i
murmured
cornelia
slowly
around
her
strained
mouth
a
smile
began
to
flicker
faintly
is
that
why
you
broke
it
off
she
asked
flippantly
yes
partly
laughed
stanton
then
cornelia
laughed
a
little
bit
too
after
this
stanton
lost
no
possible
time
in
getting
down
to
facts
stooping
over
from
his
chair
exactly
after
the
manner
of
peddlers
whom
he
had
seen
in
other
people
houses
he
unbuckled
the
straps
of
his
suitcase
and
turned
the
cover
backward
on
the
floor
cornelia
followed
every
movement
of
his
hand
with
vaguely
perplexed
blue
eyes
surely
said
stanton
this
is
the
weirdest
combination
of
circumstances
that
ever
happened
to
a
man
and
a
girl
or
rather
i
should
say
to
a
man
and
two
girls
quite
accustomed
as
he
now
was
to
the
general
effect
on
himself
of
the
whole
unique
adventure
with
the
his
heart
could
not
help
giving
a
little
extra
jump
on
this
the
verge
of
the
astonishing
revelation
that
he
was
about
to
make
to
cornelia
here
he
stammered
a
tiny
bit
out
of
breath
here
is
the
small
thin
circular
that
you
sent
me
from
the
with
your
advice
to
subscribe
and
there
pointing
earnestly
to
the
teeming
suitcase
there
are
the
minor
results
of
having
taken
your
advice
in
cornelia
face
the
expression
showed
sudden
signs
of
immediate
disorganization
snatching
the
circular
out
of
his
hand
she
read
it
hurriedly
once
twice
three
times
then
kneeling
cautiously
down
on
the
floor
with
all
the
dignity
that
characterized
every
movement
of
her
body
she
began
to
poke
here
and
there
into
the
contents
of
the
suitcase
illustration
he
unbuckled
the
straps
of
his
suitcase
and
turned
the
cover
backward
on
the
floor
the
results
she
asked
soberly
why
yes
said
stanton
there
were
several
things
i
did
have
room
to
bring
there
was
a
and
there
was
a
girl
and
there
was
a
cornelia
blonde
eyebrows
lifted
perceptibly
a
girl
whom
you
did
know
at
all
sent
you
a
she
whispered
yes
smiled
stanton
you
see
no
girl
whom
i
knew
very
well
seemed
to
care
a
hang
whether
i
froze
to
death
or
not
o
h
said
cornelia
very
very
slowly
o
her
eyes
had
a
strange
new
puzzled
expression
in
them
like
the
expression
of
a
person
who
was
trying
to
look
outward
and
think
inward
at
the
same
time
but
you
must
be
so
critical
and
haughty
about
it
all
protested
stanton
when
i
really
trying
so
hard
to
explain
everything
perfectly
honestly
to
you
so
that
you
understand
exactly
how
it
happened
i
should
like
very
much
to
be
able
to
understand
exactly
how
it
happened
mused
cornelia
gingerly
she
approached
in
succession
the
roll
of
sample
the
maps
the
the
books
the
little
silver
porringer
the
scrap
of
unfinished
one
by
one
stanton
explained
them
to
her
visualizing
by
eager
phrase
or
whimsical
gesture
the
particularly
lonesome
and
susceptible
conditions
under
which
each
gift
had
happened
to
arrive
at
the
great
pile
of
letters
cornelia
hand
faltered
a
trifle
how
many
did
i
write
you
she
asked
with
real
curiosity
five
thin
ones
and
a
said
stanton
almost
apologetically
choosing
the
fattest
looking
letter
that
she
could
find
cornelia
toyed
with
the
envelope
for
a
second
would
it
be
all
right
for
me
to
read
one
she
asked
doubtfully
why
yes
said
stanton
i
think
you
might
read
one
after
a
few
minutes
she
laid
down
the
letter
without
any
comment
would
it
be
all
right
for
me
to
read
another
she
questioned
why
yes
cried
stanton
let
read
them
all
let
read
them
together
only
of
course
we
must
read
them
in
order
almost
tenderly
he
picked
them
up
and
sorted
them
out
according
to
their
dates
of
course
he
explained
very
earnestly
of
course
i
would
think
of
showing
these
letters
to
any
one
ordinarily
but
after
all
these
particular
letters
represent
only
a
mere
business
proposition
and
certainly
this
particular
situation
must
justify
one
in
making
extraordinary
exceptions
one
by
one
he
perused
the
letters
hastily
and
handed
them
over
to
cornelia
for
her
more
careful
inspection
no
single
associate
detail
of
time
or
circumstance
seemed
to
have
eluded
his
astonishing
memory
letter
by
letter
page
by
page
he
annotated
that
was
the
week
you
did
write
at
all
or
this
was
the
stormy
agonizing
night
when
i
did
care
whether
i
lived
or
died
or
it
was
just
about
that
time
you
know
that
you
snubbed
me
for
being
scared
about
your
swimming
stunt
breathless
in
the
midst
of
her
reading
cornelia
looked
up
and
faced
him
squarely
how
could
any
girl
write
all
that
nonsense
she
gasped
it
was
so
much
what
stanton
answered
as
the
expression
in
his
eyes
that
really
startled
cornelia
nonsense
he
quoted
deliberatingly
but
i
like
it
he
said
exactly
what
i
like
but
i
could
possibly
have
given
you
anything
like
that
stammered
cornelia
no
i
know
you
could
said
stanton
very
gently
for
an
instant
cornelia
turned
and
stared
a
bit
resentfully
into
his
face
then
suddenly
the
very
gentleness
of
his
smile
ignited
a
little
answering
smile
on
her
lips
oh
you
mean
she
asked
with
unmistakable
relief
oh
you
mean
that
really
after
all
it
was
your
letter
that
jilted
me
but
my
temperament
that
jilted
you
exactly
said
stanton
cornelia
whole
somber
face
flamed
suddenly
into
unmistakable
radiance
oh
that
puts
an
entirely
different
light
upon
the
matter
she
exclaimed
oh
now
it
does
hurt
at
all
rustling
to
her
feet
she
began
to
smooth
the
wrinkles
out
of
her
skirt
with
long
even
strokes
of
her
hands
i
think
i
really
beginning
to
understand
she
said
pleasantly
and
truly
absurd
as
it
sounds
to
say
it
i
honestly
believe
that
i
care
more
for
you
this
moment
than
i
ever
cared
before
but
glancing
with
acute
dismay
at
the
cluttered
suitcase
on
the
floor
but
i
would
marry
you
now
if
we
could
live
in
the
finest
asylum
in
the
land
shrugging
his
shoulders
with
mirthful
appreciation
stanton
proceeded
then
and
there
to
his
treasures
and
end
the
interview
just
at
the
edge
of
the
threshold
cornelia
voice
called
him
back
carl
she
protested
you
are
looking
rather
sick
i
hope
you
are
going
straight
home
no
i
not
going
straight
home
said
stanton
bluntly
but
hoping
that
the
way
round
will
prove
even
yet
the
very
shortest
possible
route
to
the
particular
home
that
as
yet
even
exist
i
going
hunting
cornelia
hunting
for
molly
and
what
more
i
going
to
find
her
if
it
takes
me
all
the
rest
of
my
natural
life
xi
driving
downtown
again
with
every
thought
in
his
head
every
plan
every
purpose
hurtling
around
and
around
in
absolute
chaos
his
roving
eyes
lit
casually
upon
the
huge
sign
of
a
detective
bureau
that
loomed
across
the
street
white
as
a
sheet
with
the
sudden
new
determination
that
came
to
him
and
trembling
miserably
with
the
very
strength
of
the
determination
warring
against
the
weakness
and
fatigue
of
his
body
he
dismissed
his
cab
and
went
climbing
up
the
first
narrow
dingy
stairway
that
seemed
most
liable
to
connect
with
the
brain
behind
the
it
was
almost
before
he
came
down
the
stairs
again
yet
i
think
her
name
is
meredith
and
i
think
she
gone
to
vermont
and
she
has
the
most
wonderful
head
of
hair
that
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
were
the
only
definite
clues
that
he
had
been
able
to
contribute
to
the
cause
in
the
slow
lagging
week
that
followed
stanton
did
not
find
himself
at
all
pleased
with
the
particular
steps
which
he
had
apparently
been
obliged
to
take
in
order
to
ferret
out
molly
real
name
and
her
real
city
address
but
the
actual
audacity
of
the
situation
did
not
actually
reach
its
climax
until
the
gentle
little
quarry
had
been
literally
tracked
to
vermont
with
detectives
fairly
baying
on
her
trail
like
the
melodramatic
bloodhounds
that
pursue
eliza
across
the
ice
party
found
at
woodstock
the
valiant
sleuth
had
wired
with
unusual
delicacy
and
caution
denies
acquaintance
boston
everything
positively
refuses
interview
temper
very
bad
sure
it
the
party
the
second
message
had
come
the
very
next
train
found
stanton
fretting
the
interminable
hours
away
between
boston
and
woodstock
across
the
sparkling
landscape
his
straining
eyes
went
plowing
on
to
their
unknown
destination
sometimes
the
engine
pounded
louder
than
his
heart
sometimes
he
could
not
even
seem
to
hear
the
grinding
of
the
brakes
above
the
dreadful
of
his
temples
sometimes
in
horrid
shuddering
chills
he
huddled
into
his
great
and
cursed
the
porter
for
having
a
disposition
like
a
polar
bear
sometimes
almost
gasping
for
breath
he
went
out
and
stood
on
the
bleak
rear
platform
of
the
last
car
and
watched
the
pleasant
rails
go
speeding
back
to
boston
all
along
the
journey
little
absolutely
unnecessary
villages
kept
bobbing
up
to
impede
the
progress
of
the
train
all
along
the
journey
innumerable
little
empty
barren
as
bells
robbed
of
their
own
tongues
seemed
to
lie
waiting
waiting
for
the
noisy
to
clang
them
into
temporary
noise
and
life
was
his
quest
really
almost
at
an
end
was
it
was
it
a
thousand
vague
apprehensions
tortured
through
his
mind
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
in
the
early
brisk
winter
twilight
woodstock
happened
climbing
out
of
the
train
stanton
stood
for
a
second
rubbing
his
eyes
at
the
final
abruptness
and
unreality
of
it
all
woodstock
what
was
it
going
to
mean
to
him
woodstock
everybody
else
on
the
platform
seemed
to
be
accepting
the
astonishing
geographical
fact
with
perfect
simplicity
already
along
the
edge
of
the
platform
the
quaint
yellow
set
on
runners
were
fast
filling
up
with
utterly
serene
passengers
a
jog
at
his
elbow
made
him
turn
quickly
and
he
found
himself
gazing
into
the
detective
not
ungenial
face
say
said
the
detective
were
you
going
up
to
the
hotel
first
well
you
better
not
you
better
not
lose
any
time
she
leaving
town
in
the
morning
it
was
beyond
human
nature
for
the
detective
man
not
to
nudge
stanton
once
in
the
ribs
say
he
grinned
you
sure
had
better
go
easy
and
not
send
in
your
name
or
anything
his
grin
broadened
suddenly
in
a
laugh
say
he
confided
once
in
a
magazine
i
read
something
about
a
lady
animosity
that
her
and
oh
my
five
minutes
later
stanton
found
himself
lolling
back
in
the
quaintest
brightest
most
coach
of
all
gliding
with
almost
magical
smoothness
through
the
streets
of
the
little
narrow
the
meredith
homestead
the
driver
had
queried
oh
yes
all
right
but
it
quite
a
journey
do
get
discouraged
a
sense
of
discouragement
regarding
long
distances
was
just
at
that
moment
the
most
remote
sensation
in
stanton
sensibilities
if
the
railroad
journey
had
seemed
unhappily
drawn
out
the
reversed
the
emotion
to
the
point
of
almost
telescopic
calamity
a
stingy
transient
vista
of
village
lights
a
brief
narrow
road
that
looked
for
all
the
world
like
the
aisle
of
a
flanked
on
either
side
by
shelves
where
miniature
twinkled
cunningly
a
sudden
stumble
of
hoofs
into
a
and
then
absolutely
unavoidable
absolutely
unescapable
an
old
white
colonial
house
with
its
great
solemn
elm
trees
stretching
out
their
long
arms
protectingly
all
around
and
about
it
after
the
blessed
habit
of
a
hundred
years
nervously
and
yet
almost
reverently
stanton
went
crunching
up
the
snowy
path
to
the
door
knocked
resonantly
with
a
slim
much
worn
old
brass
knocker
and
was
admitted
promptly
and
hospitably
by
meredith
herself
molly
grandmother
evidently
and
such
a
darling
little
grandmother
small
like
molly
quick
like
molly
even
young
like
molly
she
appeared
to
be
simple
sincere
and
oh
so
comfortable
like
the
fine
old
mahogany
furniture
and
the
pewter
and
the
flickering
firelight
that
seemed
to
be
everywhere
good
old
stuff
was
stanton
immediate
silent
comment
on
everything
in
sight
it
was
perfectly
evident
that
the
little
old
lady
knew
nothing
whatsoever
about
stanton
but
it
was
equally
evident
that
she
suspected
him
of
being
neither
a
highwayman
nor
a
book
agent
and
was
really
sincerely
sorry
that
molly
had
a
headache
and
would
be
unable
to
see
him
but
i
come
so
far
persisted
stanton
all
the
way
from
boston
is
she
very
ill
has
she
been
ill
long
the
little
old
lady
mind
ignored
the
questions
but
clung
a
trifle
nervously
to
the
word
boston
boston
her
sweet
voice
quavered
boston
why
you
look
so
nice
surely
you
not
that
mysterious
man
who
has
been
annoying
mollie
so
dreadfully
these
past
few
days
i
told
her
no
good
would
ever
come
of
her
going
to
the
city
annoying
molly
cried
stanton
annoying
molly
i
why
to
prevent
anybody
in
the
whole
wide
world
from
ever
annoying
her
again
about
anything
that
i
come
here
now
he
persisted
rashly
and
do
you
see
we
had
a
little
misunderstanding
and
into
the
little
old
lady
ivory
cheek
crept
a
small
bright
oh
you
had
a
little
misunderstanding
she
repeated
softly
a
little
quarrel
oh
is
that
why
molly
has
been
crying
so
much
ever
since
she
came
home
very
gently
she
reached
out
her
tiny
hand
and
turned
stanton
big
body
around
so
that
the
smote
him
squarely
on
his
face
are
you
a
good
boy
she
asked
are
you
good
enough
for
my
little
molly
impulsively
stanton
grabbed
her
small
hands
in
his
big
ones
and
raised
them
very
tenderly
to
his
lips
illustration
are
you
a
good
boy
she
asked
oh
little
molly
little
grandmother
he
said
nobody
on
the
face
of
this
earth
is
good
enough
for
your
molly
but
you
give
me
a
chance
could
you
please
give
me
a
chance
now
this
minute
is
she
so
very
ill
no
she
not
so
very
ill
that
is
she
not
sick
in
bed
mused
the
old
lady
waveringly
she
well
enough
to
be
sitting
up
in
her
big
chair
in
front
of
her
open
fire
big
chair
open
fire
quizzed
stanton
then
are
there
two
chairs
he
asked
casually
why
yes
answered
the
in
surprise
and
a
mantelpiece
with
a
clock
on
it
he
probed
the
eyes
opened
wide
and
blue
with
astonishment
yes
she
said
but
the
clock
has
gone
for
forty
years
oh
great
exclaimed
stanton
then
wo
you
please
please
i
tell
you
it
a
case
of
life
or
death
wo
you
go
right
upstairs
and
sit
down
in
that
extra
big
chair
and
not
say
a
word
or
anything
but
just
wait
till
i
come
and
of
course
he
said
it
would
be
good
for
you
to
run
upstairs
but
if
you
could
hurry
just
a
little
i
should
be
much
obliged
as
soon
as
he
dared
he
followed
cautiously
up
the
unfamiliar
stairs
and
peered
inquisitively
through
the
illuminating
crack
of
a
loosely
closed
door
the
grandmother
as
he
remembered
her
was
dressed
in
some
funny
sort
of
a
dullish
purple
but
peeping
out
from
the
edge
of
one
of
the
chairs
he
caught
an
unmistakable
flutter
of
blue
catching
his
breath
he
tapped
gently
on
the
woodwork
round
the
big
winged
arm
of
the
chair
a
wonderful
bright
aureole
of
hair
showed
suddenly
come
in
faltered
molly
perplexed
voice
all
muffled
up
in
his
great
he
pushed
the
door
wide
open
and
entered
boldly
it
only
carl
he
said
am
i
interrupting
you
the
really
dreadful
collapsed
expression
on
molly
face
stanton
did
not
appear
to
notice
at
all
he
merely
walked
over
to
the
mantelpiece
and
leaning
his
elbows
on
the
little
cleared
space
in
front
of
the
clock
stood
staring
fixedly
at
the
which
had
not
changed
its
expression
for
forty
years
it
almost
seven
he
announced
pointedly
and
i
can
stay
till
just
eight
only
the
little
grandmother
smiled
almost
immediately
it
twenty
minutes
of
eight
now
he
announced
severely
my
how
time
flies
laughed
the
little
grandmother
when
he
turned
around
again
the
little
grandmother
had
fled
but
molly
did
not
laugh
as
he
himself
had
laughed
on
that
faraway
dreamlike
evening
in
his
rooms
instead
of
laughter
two
great
tears
welled
up
in
her
eyes
and
glistened
slowly
down
her
flushing
cheeks
what
if
this
old
clock
has
moved
a
minute
in
forty
years
whispered
stanton
passionately
it
such
a
little
time
to
eight
even
if
the
hands
never
get
there
then
turning
suddenly
to
molly
he
held
out
his
great
strong
arms
to
her
oh
molly
molly
he
cried
out
beseechingly
i
love
you
and
free
to
love
you
wo
you
please
come
to
me
illustration
it
only
carl
he
said
sliding
very
cautiously
out
of
the
big
deep
chair
molly
came
walking
hesitatingly
towards
him
like
a
little
wraith
miraculously
tinted
with
bronze
and
blue
she
stopped
and
faced
him
piteously
for
a
second
then
suddenly
she
made
a
little
wild
rush
into
his
arms
and
burrowed
her
small
frightened
face
in
his
shoulder
oh
carl
sweetheart
she
cried
i
can
really
love
you
now
love
you
carl
love
you
and
not
have
to
be
just
molly
any
more
the
end
