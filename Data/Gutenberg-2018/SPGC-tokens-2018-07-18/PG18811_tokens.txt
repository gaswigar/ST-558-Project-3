the
light
princess
i
what
no
children
once
upon
a
time
so
long
ago
that
i
have
quite
forgotten
the
date
there
lived
a
king
and
queen
who
had
no
children
and
the
king
said
to
himself
all
the
queens
of
my
acquaintance
have
children
some
three
some
seven
and
some
as
many
as
twelve
and
my
queen
has
not
one
i
feel
so
he
made
up
his
mind
to
be
cross
with
his
wife
about
it
but
she
bore
it
all
like
a
good
patient
queen
as
she
was
then
the
king
grew
very
cross
indeed
but
the
queen
pretended
to
take
it
all
as
a
joke
and
a
very
good
one
too
why
do
you
have
any
daughters
at
least
said
he
i
do
say
that
might
be
too
much
to
expect
i
am
sure
dear
king
i
am
very
sorry
said
the
queen
so
you
ought
to
be
retorted
the
king
you
are
not
going
to
make
a
virtue
of
surely
but
he
was
not
an
king
and
in
any
matter
of
less
moment
would
have
let
the
queen
have
her
own
way
with
all
his
heart
this
however
was
an
affair
of
state
the
queen
smiled
you
must
have
patience
with
a
lady
you
know
dear
king
said
she
she
was
indeed
a
very
nice
queen
and
heartily
sorry
that
she
could
not
oblige
the
king
immediately
the
king
tried
to
have
patience
but
he
succeeded
very
badly
it
was
more
than
he
deserved
therefore
when
at
last
the
queen
gave
him
a
daughter
as
lovely
a
little
princess
as
ever
cried
ii
wo
i
just
the
day
drew
near
when
the
infant
must
be
christened
the
king
wrote
all
the
invitations
with
his
own
hand
of
course
somebody
was
forgotten
now
it
does
not
generally
matter
if
somebody
forgotten
only
you
must
mind
who
unfortunately
the
king
forgot
without
intending
to
forget
and
so
the
chance
fell
upon
the
princess
makemnoit
which
was
awkward
for
the
princess
was
the
king
own
sister
and
he
ought
not
to
have
forgotten
her
but
she
had
made
herself
so
disagreeable
to
the
old
king
their
father
that
he
had
forgotten
her
in
making
his
will
and
so
it
was
no
wonder
that
her
brother
forgot
her
in
writing
his
invitations
but
poor
relations
do
do
anything
to
keep
you
in
mind
of
them
why
do
they
the
king
could
not
see
into
the
garret
she
lived
in
could
he
she
was
a
sour
spiteful
creature
the
wrinkles
of
contempt
crossed
the
wrinkles
of
peevishness
and
made
her
face
as
full
of
wrinkles
as
a
pat
of
butter
if
ever
a
king
could
be
justified
in
forgetting
anybody
this
king
was
justified
in
forgetting
his
sister
even
at
a
christening
she
looked
very
odd
too
her
forehead
was
as
large
as
all
the
rest
of
her
face
and
projected
over
it
like
a
precipice
when
she
was
angry
her
little
eyes
flashed
blue
when
she
hated
anybody
they
shone
yellow
and
green
what
they
looked
like
when
she
loved
anybody
i
do
not
know
for
i
never
heard
of
her
loving
anybody
but
herself
and
i
do
not
think
she
could
have
managed
that
if
she
had
not
somehow
got
used
to
herself
but
what
made
it
highly
imprudent
in
the
king
to
forget
her
was
that
she
was
awfully
clever
in
fact
she
was
a
witch
and
when
she
bewitched
anybody
he
very
soon
had
enough
of
it
for
she
beat
all
the
wicked
fairies
in
wickedness
and
all
the
clever
ones
in
cleverness
she
despised
all
the
modes
we
read
of
in
history
in
which
offended
fairies
and
witches
have
taken
their
revenges
and
therefore
after
waiting
and
waiting
in
vain
for
an
invitation
she
made
up
her
mind
at
last
to
go
without
one
and
make
the
whole
family
miserable
like
a
princess
as
she
was
so
she
put
on
her
best
gown
went
to
the
palace
was
kindly
received
by
the
happy
monarch
who
forgot
that
he
had
forgotten
her
and
took
her
place
in
the
procession
to
the
royal
chapel
when
they
were
all
gathered
about
the
font
she
contrived
to
get
next
to
it
and
throw
something
into
the
water
after
which
she
maintained
a
very
respectful
demeanour
till
the
water
was
applied
to
the
child
face
but
at
that
moment
she
turned
round
in
her
place
three
times
and
muttered
the
following
words
loud
enough
for
those
beside
her
to
hear
light
of
spirit
by
my
charms
light
of
body
every
part
never
weary
human
arms
only
crush
thy
parents
heart
they
all
thought
she
had
lost
her
wits
and
was
repeating
some
foolish
nursery
rhyme
but
a
shudder
went
through
the
whole
of
them
notwithstanding
the
baby
on
the
contrary
began
to
laugh
and
crow
while
the
nurse
gave
a
start
and
a
smothered
cry
for
she
thought
she
was
struck
with
paralysis
she
could
not
feel
the
baby
in
her
arms
but
she
clasped
it
tight
and
said
nothing
the
mischief
was
done
iii
she
ca
be
ours
her
atrocious
aunt
had
deprived
the
child
of
all
her
gravity
if
you
ask
me
how
this
was
effected
i
answer
in
the
easiest
way
in
the
world
she
had
only
to
destroy
gravitation
for
the
princess
was
a
philosopher
and
knew
all
the
and
of
the
laws
of
gravitation
as
well
as
the
and
of
her
and
being
a
witch
as
well
she
could
abrogate
those
laws
in
a
moment
or
at
least
so
clog
their
wheels
and
rust
their
bearings
that
they
would
not
work
at
all
but
we
have
more
to
do
with
what
followed
than
with
how
it
was
done
the
first
awkwardness
that
resulted
from
this
unhappy
privation
was
that
the
moment
the
nurse
began
to
float
the
baby
up
and
down
she
flew
from
her
arms
towards
the
ceiling
happily
the
resistance
of
the
air
brought
her
ascending
career
to
a
close
within
a
foot
of
it
there
she
remained
horizontal
as
when
she
left
her
nurse
arms
kicking
and
laughing
amazingly
the
nurse
in
terror
flew
to
the
bell
and
begged
the
footman
who
answered
it
to
bring
up
the
directly
trembling
in
every
limb
she
climbed
upon
the
steps
and
had
to
stand
upon
the
very
top
and
reach
up
before
she
could
catch
the
floating
tail
of
the
baby
long
clothes
when
the
strange
fact
came
to
be
known
there
was
a
terrible
commotion
in
the
palace
the
occasion
of
its
discovery
by
the
king
was
naturally
a
repetition
of
the
nurse
experience
astonished
that
he
felt
no
weight
when
the
child
was
laid
in
his
arms
he
began
to
wave
her
up
and
not
down
for
she
slowly
ascended
to
the
ceiling
as
before
and
there
remained
floating
in
perfect
comfort
and
satisfaction
as
was
testified
by
her
peals
of
tiny
laughter
the
king
stood
staring
up
in
speechless
amazement
and
trembled
so
that
his
beard
shook
like
grass
in
the
wind
at
last
turning
to
the
queen
who
was
just
as
as
himself
he
said
gasping
staring
and
stammering
she
be
ours
queen
now
the
queen
was
much
cleverer
than
the
king
and
had
begun
already
to
suspect
that
this
effect
defective
came
by
cause
i
am
sure
she
is
ours
answered
she
but
we
ought
to
have
taken
better
care
of
her
at
the
christening
people
who
were
never
invited
ought
not
to
have
been
present
oh
ho
said
the
king
tapping
his
forehead
with
his
forefinger
i
have
it
all
i
found
her
out
do
you
see
it
queen
princess
makemnoit
has
bewitched
her
that
just
what
i
say
answered
the
queen
i
beg
your
pardon
my
love
i
did
not
hear
john
bring
the
steps
i
get
on
my
throne
with
for
he
was
a
little
king
with
a
great
throne
like
many
other
kings
the
were
brought
and
set
upon
the
and
john
got
upon
the
top
of
them
but
he
could
not
reach
the
little
princess
who
lay
like
a
in
the
air
exploding
continuously
take
the
tongs
john
said
his
majesty
and
getting
up
on
the
table
he
handed
them
to
him
john
could
reach
the
baby
now
and
the
little
princess
was
handed
down
by
the
tongs
iv
where
is
she
one
fine
summer
day
a
month
after
these
her
first
adventures
during
which
time
she
had
been
very
carefully
watched
the
princess
was
lying
on
the
bed
in
the
queen
own
chamber
fast
asleep
one
of
the
windows
was
open
for
it
was
noon
and
the
day
so
sultry
that
the
little
girl
was
wrapped
in
nothing
less
ethereal
than
slumber
itself
the
queen
came
into
the
room
and
not
observing
that
the
baby
was
on
the
bed
opened
another
window
a
frolicsome
fairy
wind
which
had
been
watching
for
a
chance
of
mischief
rushed
in
at
the
one
window
and
taking
its
way
over
the
bed
where
the
child
was
lying
caught
her
up
and
rolling
and
floating
her
along
like
a
piece
of
flue
or
a
carried
her
with
it
through
the
opposite
window
and
away
the
queen
went
quite
ignorant
of
the
loss
she
had
herself
occasioned
when
the
nurse
returned
she
supposed
that
her
majesty
had
carried
her
off
and
dreading
a
scolding
delayed
making
inquiry
about
her
but
hearing
nothing
she
grew
uneasy
and
went
at
length
to
the
boudoir
where
she
found
her
majesty
please
your
majesty
shall
i
take
the
baby
said
she
where
is
she
asked
the
queen
please
forgive
me
i
know
it
was
wrong
what
do
you
mean
said
the
queen
looking
grave
oh
do
frighten
me
your
majesty
exclaimed
the
nurse
clasping
her
hands
the
queen
saw
that
something
was
amiss
and
fell
down
in
a
faint
the
nurse
rushed
about
the
palace
screaming
my
baby
my
baby
every
one
ran
to
the
queen
room
but
the
queen
could
give
no
orders
they
soon
found
out
however
that
the
princess
was
missing
and
in
a
moment
the
palace
was
like
a
beehive
in
a
garden
and
in
one
minute
more
the
queen
was
brought
to
herself
by
a
great
shout
and
a
clapping
of
hands
they
had
found
the
princess
fast
asleep
under
a
to
which
the
elvish
little
had
carried
her
finishing
its
mischief
by
shaking
a
shower
of
red
all
over
the
little
white
sleeper
startled
by
the
noise
the
servants
made
she
woke
and
furious
with
glee
scattered
the
in
all
directions
like
a
shower
of
spray
in
the
sunset
she
was
watched
more
carefully
after
this
no
doubt
yet
it
would
be
endless
to
relate
all
the
odd
incidents
resulting
from
this
peculiarity
of
the
young
princess
but
there
never
was
a
baby
in
a
house
not
to
say
a
palace
that
kept
the
household
in
such
constant
at
least
if
it
was
not
easy
for
her
nurses
to
hold
her
at
least
she
made
neither
their
arms
nor
their
hearts
ache
and
she
was
so
nice
to
play
at
ball
with
there
was
positively
no
danger
of
letting
her
fall
they
might
throw
her
down
or
knock
her
down
or
push
her
down
but
could
her
down
it
is
true
they
might
let
her
fly
into
the
fire
or
the
or
through
the
window
but
none
of
these
accidents
had
happened
as
yet
if
you
heard
peals
of
laughter
resounding
from
some
unknown
region
you
might
be
sure
enough
of
the
cause
going
down
into
the
kitchen
or
you
would
find
jane
and
thomas
and
robert
and
susan
all
and
sum
playing
at
ball
with
the
little
princess
she
was
the
ball
herself
and
did
not
enjoy
it
the
less
for
that
away
she
went
flying
from
one
to
another
screeching
with
laughter
and
the
servants
loved
the
ball
itself
better
even
than
the
game
but
they
had
to
take
some
care
how
they
threw
her
for
if
she
received
an
upward
direction
she
would
never
come
down
again
without
being
fetched
what
is
to
be
done
but
it
was
different
one
day
for
instance
after
breakfast
the
king
went
into
his
and
counted
out
his
money
the
operation
gave
him
no
pleasure
to
think
said
he
to
himself
that
every
one
of
these
gold
sovereigns
weighs
a
quarter
of
an
ounce
and
my
real
live
princess
weighs
nothing
at
all
and
he
hated
his
gold
sovereigns
as
they
lay
with
a
broad
smile
of
all
over
their
yellow
faces
the
queen
was
in
the
parlour
eating
bread
and
honey
but
at
the
second
mouthful
she
burst
out
crying
and
could
not
swallow
it
the
king
heard
her
sobbing
glad
of
anybody
but
especially
of
his
queen
to
quarrel
with
he
clashed
his
gold
sovereigns
into
his
clapped
his
crown
on
his
head
and
rushed
into
the
parlour
what
is
all
this
about
exclaimed
he
what
are
you
crying
for
queen
i
ca
eat
it
said
the
queen
looking
ruefully
at
the
no
wonder
retorted
the
king
you
just
eaten
your
breakfast
two
turkey
eggs
and
three
anchovies
oh
that
not
it
sobbed
her
majesty
it
my
child
my
child
well
what
the
matter
with
your
child
she
neither
up
the
chimney
nor
down
the
just
hear
her
laughing
yet
the
king
could
not
help
a
sigh
which
he
tried
to
turn
into
a
cough
saying
it
is
a
good
thing
to
be
i
am
sure
whether
she
be
ours
or
not
it
is
a
bad
thing
to
be
answered
the
queen
looking
with
prophetic
soul
far
into
the
future
is
a
good
thing
to
be
said
the
king
is
a
bad
thing
to
be
answered
the
queen
is
a
good
thing
to
be
said
the
king
is
a
bad
thing
began
the
queen
but
the
king
interrupted
her
in
fact
said
he
with
the
tone
of
one
who
concludes
an
argument
in
which
he
has
had
only
imaginary
opponents
and
in
which
therefore
he
has
come
off
triumphant
in
fact
it
is
a
good
thing
altogether
to
be
but
it
is
a
bad
thing
altogether
to
be
retorted
the
queen
who
was
beginning
to
lose
her
temper
this
last
answer
quite
discomfited
his
majesty
who
turned
on
his
heel
and
betook
himself
to
his
again
but
he
was
not
towards
it
when
the
voice
of
his
queen
overtook
him
and
it
a
bad
thing
to
be
screamed
she
determined
to
have
more
last
words
now
that
her
spirit
was
roused
the
queen
hair
was
black
as
night
and
the
king
had
been
and
his
daughter
was
golden
as
morning
but
it
was
not
this
reflection
on
his
hair
that
arrested
him
it
was
the
double
use
of
the
word
for
the
king
hated
all
witticisms
and
punning
especially
and
besides
he
could
not
tell
whether
the
queen
meant
or
for
why
might
she
not
aspirate
her
vowels
when
she
was
herself
he
turned
upon
his
other
heel
and
rejoined
her
she
looked
angry
still
because
she
knew
that
she
was
guilty
or
what
was
much
the
same
knew
that
he
thought
so
my
dear
queen
said
he
duplicity
of
any
sort
is
exceedingly
objectionable
between
married
people
of
any
rank
not
to
say
kings
and
queens
and
the
most
objectionable
form
duplicity
can
assume
is
that
of
punning
there
said
the
queen
i
never
made
a
jest
but
i
broke
it
in
the
making
i
am
the
most
unfortunate
woman
in
the
world
she
looked
so
rueful
that
the
king
took
her
in
his
arms
and
they
sat
down
to
consult
can
you
bear
this
said
the
king
no
i
ca
said
the
queen
well
what
to
be
done
said
the
king
i
sure
i
do
know
said
the
queen
but
might
you
not
try
an
apology
to
my
old
sister
i
suppose
you
mean
said
the
king
yes
said
the
queen
well
i
do
mind
said
the
king
so
he
went
the
next
morning
to
the
house
of
the
princess
and
making
a
very
humble
apology
begged
her
to
undo
the
spell
but
the
princess
declared
with
a
grave
face
that
she
knew
nothing
at
all
about
it
her
eyes
however
shone
pink
which
was
a
sign
that
she
was
happy
she
advised
the
king
and
queen
to
have
patience
and
to
mend
their
ways
the
king
returned
disconsolate
the
queen
tried
to
comfort
him
we
will
wait
till
she
is
older
she
may
then
be
able
to
suggest
something
herself
she
will
know
at
least
how
she
feels
and
explain
things
to
us
but
what
if
she
should
marry
exclaimed
the
king
in
sudden
consternation
at
the
idea
well
what
of
that
rejoined
the
queen
just
think
if
she
were
to
have
children
in
the
course
of
a
hundred
years
the
air
might
be
as
full
of
floating
children
as
of
gossamers
in
autumn
that
is
no
business
of
ours
replied
the
queen
besides
by
that
time
they
will
have
learned
to
take
care
of
themselves
a
sigh
was
the
king
only
answer
he
would
have
consulted
the
court
physicians
but
he
was
afraid
they
would
try
experiments
upon
her
vi
she
laughs
too
much
meantime
notwithstanding
awkward
occurrences
and
griefs
that
she
brought
upon
her
parents
the
little
princess
laughed
and
grew
not
fat
but
plump
and
tall
she
reached
the
age
of
seventeen
without
having
fallen
into
any
worse
scrape
than
a
chimney
by
rescuing
her
from
which
a
little
urchin
got
fame
and
a
black
face
nor
thoughtless
as
she
was
had
she
committed
anything
worse
than
laughter
at
everybody
and
everything
that
came
in
her
way
when
she
was
told
for
the
sake
of
experiment
that
general
clanrunfort
was
cut
to
pieces
with
all
his
troops
she
laughed
when
she
heard
that
the
enemy
was
on
his
way
to
besiege
her
papa
capital
she
laughed
hugely
but
when
she
was
told
that
the
city
would
certainly
be
abandoned
to
the
mercy
of
the
enemy
soldiery
why
then
she
laughed
immoderately
she
never
could
be
brought
to
see
the
serious
side
of
anything
when
her
mother
cried
she
said
what
queer
faces
mamma
makes
and
she
squeezes
water
out
of
her
cheeks
funny
mamma
and
when
her
papa
stormed
at
her
she
laughed
and
danced
round
and
round
him
clapping
her
hands
and
crying
do
it
again
papa
do
it
again
it
such
fun
dear
funny
papa
and
if
he
tried
to
catch
her
she
glided
from
him
in
an
instant
not
in
the
least
afraid
of
him
but
thinking
it
part
of
the
game
not
to
be
caught
with
one
push
of
her
foot
she
would
be
floating
in
the
air
above
his
head
or
she
would
go
dancing
backwards
and
forwards
and
sideways
like
a
great
butterfly
it
happened
several
times
when
her
father
and
mother
were
holding
a
consultation
about
her
in
private
that
they
were
interrupted
by
vainly
repressed
outbursts
of
laughter
over
their
heads
and
looking
up
with
indignation
saw
her
floating
at
full
length
in
the
air
above
them
whence
she
regarded
them
with
the
most
comical
appreciation
of
the
position
one
day
an
awkward
accident
happened
the
princess
had
come
out
upon
the
lawn
with
one
of
her
attendants
who
held
her
by
the
hand
spying
her
father
at
the
other
side
of
the
lawn
she
snatched
her
hand
from
the
maid
and
sped
across
to
him
now
when
she
wanted
to
run
alone
her
custom
was
to
catch
up
a
stone
in
each
hand
so
that
she
might
come
down
again
after
a
bound
whatever
she
wore
as
part
of
her
attire
had
no
effect
in
this
way
even
gold
when
it
thus
became
as
it
were
a
part
of
herself
lost
all
its
weight
for
the
time
but
whatever
she
only
held
in
her
hands
retained
its
downward
tendency
on
this
occasion
she
could
see
nothing
to
catch
up
but
a
huge
toad
that
was
walking
across
the
lawn
as
if
he
had
a
hundred
years
to
do
it
in
not
knowing
what
disgust
meant
for
this
was
one
of
her
peculiarities
she
snatched
up
the
toad
and
bounded
away
she
had
almost
reached
her
father
and
he
was
holding
out
his
arms
to
receive
her
and
take
from
her
lips
the
kiss
which
hovered
on
them
like
a
butterfly
on
a
rosebud
when
a
puff
of
wind
blew
her
aside
into
the
arms
of
a
young
page
who
had
just
been
receiving
a
message
from
his
majesty
now
it
was
no
great
peculiarity
in
the
princess
that
once
she
was
set
agoing
it
always
cost
her
time
and
trouble
to
check
herself
on
this
occasion
there
was
no
time
she
kiss
and
she
kissed
the
page
she
did
not
mind
it
much
for
she
had
no
shyness
in
her
composition
and
she
knew
besides
that
she
could
not
help
it
so
she
only
laughed
like
a
musical
box
the
poor
page
fared
the
worst
for
the
princess
trying
to
correct
the
unfortunate
tendency
of
the
kiss
put
out
her
hands
to
keep
her
off
the
page
so
that
along
with
the
kiss
he
received
on
the
other
cheek
a
slap
with
the
huge
black
toad
which
she
poked
right
into
his
eye
he
tried
to
laugh
too
but
the
attempt
resulted
in
such
an
odd
contortion
of
countenance
as
showed
that
there
was
no
danger
of
his
pluming
himself
on
the
kiss
as
for
the
king
his
dignity
was
greatly
hurt
and
he
did
not
speak
to
the
page
for
a
whole
month
i
may
here
remark
that
it
was
very
amusing
to
see
her
run
if
her
mode
of
progression
could
properly
be
called
running
for
first
she
would
make
a
bound
then
having
alighted
she
would
run
a
few
steps
and
make
another
bound
sometimes
she
would
fancy
she
had
reached
the
ground
before
she
actually
had
and
her
feet
would
go
backwards
and
forwards
running
upon
nothing
at
all
like
those
of
a
chicken
on
its
back
then
she
would
laugh
like
the
very
spirit
of
fun
only
in
her
laugh
there
was
something
missing
what
it
was
i
find
myself
unable
to
describe
i
think
it
was
a
certain
tone
depending
upon
the
possibility
of
sorrow
perhaps
she
never
smiled
vii
try
metaphysics
after
a
long
avoidance
of
the
painful
subject
the
king
and
queen
resolved
to
hold
a
council
of
three
upon
it
and
so
they
sent
for
the
princess
in
she
came
sliding
and
flitting
and
gliding
from
one
piece
of
furniture
to
another
and
put
herself
at
last
in
an
armchair
in
a
sitting
posture
whether
she
could
be
said
to
seeing
she
received
no
support
from
the
seat
of
the
chair
i
do
not
pretend
to
determine
my
dear
child
said
the
king
you
must
be
aware
by
this
time
that
you
are
not
exactly
like
other
people
oh
you
dear
funny
papa
i
have
got
a
nose
and
two
eyes
and
all
the
rest
so
have
you
so
has
mamma
now
be
serious
my
dear
for
once
said
the
queen
no
thank
you
mamma
i
had
rather
not
would
you
not
like
to
be
able
to
walk
like
other
people
said
the
king
no
indeed
i
should
think
not
you
only
crawl
you
are
such
slow
coaches
how
do
you
feel
my
child
he
resumed
after
a
pause
of
discomfiture
quite
well
thank
you
i
mean
what
do
you
feel
like
like
nothing
at
all
that
i
know
of
you
must
feel
like
something
i
feel
like
a
princess
with
such
a
funny
papa
and
such
a
dear
pet
of
a
now
really
began
the
queen
but
the
princess
interrupted
her
oh
yes
she
added
i
remember
i
have
a
curious
feeling
sometimes
as
if
i
were
the
only
person
that
had
any
sense
in
the
whole
world
she
had
been
trying
to
behave
herself
with
dignity
but
now
she
burst
into
a
violent
fit
of
laughter
threw
herself
backwards
over
the
chair
and
went
rolling
about
the
floor
in
an
ecstasy
of
enjoyment
the
king
picked
her
up
easier
than
one
does
a
down
quilt
and
replaced
her
in
her
former
relation
to
the
chair
the
exact
preposition
expressing
this
relation
i
do
not
happen
to
know
is
there
nothing
you
wish
for
resumed
the
king
who
had
learned
by
this
time
that
it
was
quite
useless
to
be
angry
with
her
oh
you
dear
papa
yes
answered
she
what
is
it
my
darling
i
have
been
longing
for
it
oh
such
a
time
ever
since
last
night
tell
me
what
it
is
will
you
promise
to
let
me
have
it
the
king
was
on
the
point
of
saying
but
the
wiser
queen
checked
him
with
a
single
motion
of
her
head
tell
me
what
it
is
first
said
he
no
no
promise
first
i
dare
not
what
is
it
mind
i
hold
you
to
your
it
is
to
be
tied
to
the
end
of
a
string
a
very
long
string
indeed
and
be
flown
like
a
kite
oh
such
fun
i
would
rain
and
hail
and
snow
and
and
and
a
fit
of
laughing
checked
her
and
she
would
have
been
off
again
over
the
floor
had
not
the
king
started
up
and
caught
her
just
in
time
seeing
nothing
but
talk
could
be
got
out
of
her
he
rang
the
bell
and
sent
her
away
with
two
of
her
now
queen
he
said
turning
to
her
majesty
what
to
be
done
there
is
but
one
thing
left
answered
she
let
us
consult
the
college
of
metaphysicians
bravo
cried
the
king
we
will
now
at
the
head
of
this
college
were
two
very
wise
chinese
philosophers
by
name
and
for
them
the
king
sent
and
straightway
they
came
in
a
long
speech
he
communicated
to
them
what
they
knew
very
well
already
as
who
did
not
namely
the
peculiar
condition
of
his
daughter
in
relation
to
the
globe
on
which
she
dwelt
and
requested
them
to
consult
together
as
to
what
might
be
the
cause
and
probable
cure
of
her
the
king
laid
stress
upon
the
word
but
failed
to
discover
his
own
pun
the
queen
laughed
but
and
heard
with
humility
and
retired
in
silence
the
consultation
consisted
chiefly
in
propounding
and
supporting
for
the
thousandth
time
each
his
favourite
theories
for
the
condition
of
the
princess
afforded
delightful
scope
for
the
discussion
of
every
question
arising
from
the
division
of
thought
in
fact
of
all
the
metaphysics
of
the
chinese
empire
but
it
is
only
justice
to
say
that
they
did
not
altogether
neglect
the
discussion
of
the
practical
question
was
to
be
was
a
materialist
and
was
a
spiritualist
the
former
was
slow
and
sententious
the
latter
was
quick
and
flighty
the
latter
had
generally
the
first
word
the
former
the
last
i
reassert
my
former
assertion
began
with
a
plunge
there
is
not
a
fault
in
the
princess
body
or
soul
only
they
are
wrong
put
together
listen
to
me
now
and
i
will
tell
you
in
brief
what
i
think
do
speak
do
answer
me
i
hear
you
till
i
have
at
that
decisive
moment
when
souls
seek
their
appointed
habitations
two
eager
souls
met
struck
rebounded
lost
their
way
and
arrived
each
at
the
wrong
place
the
soul
of
the
princess
was
one
of
those
and
she
went
far
astray
she
does
not
belong
by
rights
to
this
world
at
all
but
to
some
other
planet
probably
mercury
her
proclivity
to
her
true
sphere
destroys
all
the
natural
influence
which
this
orb
would
otherwise
possess
over
her
corporeal
frame
she
cares
for
nothing
here
there
is
no
relation
between
her
and
this
world
she
must
therefore
be
taught
by
the
sternest
compulsion
to
take
an
interest
in
the
earth
as
the
earth
she
must
study
every
department
of
its
history
its
animal
history
its
vegetable
history
its
mineral
history
its
social
history
its
moral
history
its
political
history
its
scientific
history
its
literary
history
its
musical
history
its
artistical
history
above
all
its
metaphysical
history
she
must
begin
with
the
chinese
dynasty
and
end
with
japan
but
first
of
all
she
must
study
geology
and
especially
the
history
of
the
extinct
races
of
animals
their
natures
their
habits
their
loves
their
hates
their
revenges
she
must
hold
roared
it
is
certainly
my
turn
now
my
rooted
and
insubvertible
conviction
is
that
the
causes
of
the
anomalies
evident
in
the
princess
condition
are
strictly
and
solely
physical
but
that
is
only
tantamount
to
acknowledging
that
they
exist
hear
my
from
some
cause
or
other
of
no
importance
to
our
inquiry
the
motion
of
her
heart
has
been
reversed
that
remarkable
combination
of
the
suction
and
the
works
the
wrong
way
i
mean
in
the
case
of
the
princess
it
draws
in
where
it
should
force
out
and
forces
out
where
it
should
draw
in
the
offices
of
the
auricles
and
the
ventricles
are
subverted
the
blood
is
sent
forth
by
the
veins
and
returns
by
the
arteries
consequently
it
is
running
the
wrong
way
through
all
her
corporeal
organism
lungs
and
all
is
it
then
at
all
mysterious
seeing
that
such
is
the
case
that
on
the
other
particular
of
gravitation
as
well
she
should
differ
from
normal
humanity
my
proposal
for
the
cure
is
this
phlebotomize
until
she
is
reduced
to
the
last
point
of
safety
let
it
be
affected
if
necessary
in
a
warm
bath
when
she
is
reduced
to
a
state
of
perfect
asphyxy
apply
a
ligature
to
the
left
ankle
drawing
it
as
tight
as
the
bone
will
bear
apply
at
the
same
moment
another
of
equal
tension
around
the
right
wrist
by
means
of
plates
constructed
for
the
purpose
place
the
other
foot
and
hand
under
the
receivers
of
two
exhaust
the
receivers
exhibit
a
pint
of
french
brandy
and
await
the
result
which
would
presently
arrive
in
the
form
of
grim
death
said
if
it
should
she
would
yet
die
in
doing
our
duty
retorted
but
their
majesties
had
too
much
tenderness
for
their
volatile
offspring
to
subject
her
to
either
of
the
schemes
of
the
equally
unscrupulous
philosophers
indeed
the
most
complete
knowledge
of
the
laws
of
nature
would
have
been
unserviceable
in
her
case
for
it
was
impossible
to
classify
her
she
was
a
fifth
imponderable
body
sharing
all
the
other
properties
of
the
ponderable
viii
try
a
drop
of
water
perhaps
the
best
thing
for
the
princess
would
have
been
to
fall
in
love
but
how
a
princess
who
had
no
gravity
could
fall
into
anything
is
a
difficulty
perhaps
difficulty
as
for
her
own
feelings
on
the
subject
she
did
not
even
know
that
there
was
such
a
beehive
of
honey
and
stings
to
be
fallen
into
but
now
i
come
to
mention
another
curious
fact
about
her
the
palace
was
built
on
the
shore
of
the
loveliest
lake
in
the
world
and
the
princess
loved
this
lake
more
than
father
or
mother
the
root
of
this
preference
no
doubt
although
the
princess
did
not
recognize
it
as
such
was
that
the
moment
she
got
into
it
she
recovered
the
natural
right
of
which
she
had
been
so
wickedly
deprived
namely
gravity
whether
this
was
owing
to
the
fact
that
water
had
been
employed
as
the
means
of
conveying
the
injury
i
do
not
know
but
it
is
certain
that
she
could
swim
and
dive
like
the
duck
that
her
old
nurse
said
she
was
the
manner
in
which
this
alleviation
of
her
misfortune
was
discovered
was
as
follows
one
summer
evening
during
the
carnival
of
the
country
she
had
been
taken
upon
the
lake
by
the
king
and
queen
in
the
royal
barge
they
were
accompanied
by
many
of
the
courtiers
in
a
fleet
of
little
boats
in
the
middle
of
the
lake
she
wanted
to
get
into
the
lord
barge
for
his
daughter
who
was
a
great
favourite
with
her
was
in
it
with
her
father
now
though
the
old
king
rarely
condescended
to
make
light
of
his
misfortune
yet
happening
on
this
occasion
to
be
in
a
particularly
good
humour
as
the
barges
approached
each
other
he
caught
up
the
princess
to
throw
her
into
the
chancellor
barge
he
lost
his
balance
however
and
dropping
into
the
bottom
of
the
barge
lost
his
hold
of
his
daughter
not
however
before
imparting
to
her
the
downward
tendency
of
his
own
person
though
in
a
somewhat
different
direction
for
as
the
king
fell
into
the
boat
she
fell
into
the
water
with
a
burst
of
delightful
laughter
she
disappeared
in
the
lake
a
cry
of
horror
ascended
from
the
boats
they
had
never
seen
the
princess
go
down
before
half
the
men
were
under
water
in
a
moment
but
they
had
all
one
after
another
come
up
to
the
surface
again
for
breath
when
tinkle
tinkle
babble
and
gush
came
the
laugh
over
the
water
from
far
away
there
she
was
swimming
like
a
swan
nor
would
she
come
out
for
king
or
queen
chancellor
or
daughter
she
was
perfectly
obstinate
but
at
the
same
time
she
seemed
more
sedate
than
usual
perhaps
that
was
because
a
great
pleasure
spoils
laughing
at
all
events
after
this
the
passion
of
her
life
was
to
get
into
the
water
and
she
was
always
the
better
behaved
and
the
more
beautiful
the
more
she
had
of
it
summer
and
winter
it
was
quite
the
same
only
she
could
not
stay
so
long
in
the
water
when
they
had
to
break
the
ice
to
let
her
in
any
day
from
morning
till
evening
in
summer
she
might
be
descried
a
streak
of
white
in
the
blue
water
lying
as
still
as
the
shadow
of
a
cloud
or
shooting
along
like
a
dolphin
disappearing
and
coming
up
again
far
off
just
where
one
did
not
expect
her
she
would
have
been
in
the
lake
of
a
night
too
if
she
could
have
had
her
way
for
the
balcony
of
her
window
overhung
a
deep
pool
in
it
and
through
a
shallow
reedy
passage
she
could
have
swum
out
into
the
wide
wet
water
and
no
one
would
have
been
any
the
wiser
indeed
when
she
happened
to
wake
in
the
moonlight
she
could
hardly
resist
the
temptation
but
there
was
the
sad
difficulty
of
getting
into
it
she
had
as
great
a
dread
of
the
air
as
some
children
have
of
the
water
for
the
slightest
gust
of
wind
would
blow
her
away
and
a
gust
might
arise
in
the
stillest
moment
and
if
she
gave
herself
a
push
towards
the
water
and
just
failed
of
reaching
it
her
situation
would
be
dreadfully
awkward
irrespective
of
the
wind
for
at
best
there
she
would
have
to
remain
suspended
in
her
till
she
was
seen
and
angled
for
by
someone
from
the
window
oh
if
i
had
my
gravity
thought
she
contemplating
the
water
i
would
flash
off
this
balcony
like
a
long
white
headlong
into
the
darling
wetness
this
was
the
only
consideration
that
made
her
wish
to
be
like
other
people
another
reason
for
her
being
fond
of
the
water
was
that
in
it
alone
she
enjoyed
any
freedom
for
she
could
not
walk
out
without
a
consisting
in
part
of
a
troop
of
light
horse
for
fear
of
the
liberties
which
the
wind
might
take
with
her
and
the
king
grew
more
apprehensive
with
increasing
years
till
at
last
he
would
not
allow
her
to
walk
abroad
at
all
without
some
twenty
silken
cords
fastened
to
as
many
parts
of
her
dress
and
held
by
twenty
noblemen
of
course
horseback
was
out
of
the
question
but
she
bade
to
all
this
ceremony
when
she
got
into
the
water
and
so
remarkable
were
its
effects
upon
her
especially
in
restoring
her
for
the
time
to
the
ordinary
human
gravity
that
and
agreed
in
recommending
the
king
to
bury
her
alive
for
three
years
in
the
hope
that
as
the
water
did
her
so
much
good
the
earth
would
do
her
yet
more
but
the
king
had
some
vulgar
prejudices
against
the
experiment
and
would
not
give
his
consent
foiled
in
this
they
yet
agreed
in
another
recommendation
which
seeing
that
the
one
imported
his
opinions
from
china
and
the
other
from
thibet
was
very
remarkable
indeed
they
argued
that
if
water
of
external
origin
and
application
could
be
so
efficacious
water
from
a
deeper
source
might
work
a
perfect
cure
in
short
that
if
the
poor
afflicted
princess
could
by
any
means
be
made
to
cry
she
might
recover
her
lost
gravity
but
how
was
this
to
be
brought
about
therein
lay
all
the
difficulty
to
meet
which
the
philosophers
were
not
wise
enough
to
make
the
princess
cry
was
as
impossible
as
to
make
her
weigh
they
sent
for
a
professional
beggar
commanded
him
to
prepare
his
most
touching
oracle
of
woe
helped
him
out
of
the
court
to
whatever
he
wanted
for
dressing
up
and
promised
great
rewards
in
the
event
of
his
success
but
it
was
all
in
vain
she
listened
to
the
mendicant
story
and
gazed
at
his
marvellous
till
she
could
contain
herself
no
longer
and
went
into
the
most
undignified
contortions
for
relief
shrieking
positively
screeching
with
laughter
when
she
had
a
little
recovered
herself
she
ordered
her
attendants
to
drive
him
away
and
not
give
him
a
single
copper
whereupon
his
look
of
mortified
discomfiture
wrought
her
punishment
and
his
revenge
for
it
sent
her
into
violent
hysterics
from
which
she
was
with
difficulty
recovered
but
so
anxious
was
the
king
that
the
suggestion
should
have
a
fair
trial
that
he
put
himself
in
a
rage
one
day
and
rushing
up
to
her
room
gave
her
an
awful
whipping
yet
not
a
tear
would
flow
she
looked
grave
and
her
laughing
sounded
uncommonly
like
screaming
that
was
all
the
good
old
tyrant
though
he
put
on
his
best
gold
spectacles
to
look
could
not
discover
the
smallest
cloud
in
the
serene
blue
of
her
eyes
ix
put
me
in
again
it
must
have
been
about
this
time
that
the
son
of
a
king
who
lived
a
thousand
miles
from
lagobel
set
out
to
look
for
the
daughter
of
a
queen
he
travelled
far
and
wide
but
as
sure
as
he
found
a
princess
he
found
some
fault
in
her
of
course
he
could
not
marry
a
mere
woman
however
beautiful
and
there
was
no
princess
to
be
found
worthy
of
him
whether
the
prince
was
so
near
perfection
that
he
had
a
right
to
demand
perfection
itself
i
can
not
pretend
to
say
all
i
know
is
that
he
was
a
fine
handsome
brave
generous
and
youth
as
all
princes
are
in
his
wanderings
he
had
come
across
some
reports
about
our
princess
but
as
everybody
said
she
was
bewitched
he
never
dreamed
that
she
could
bewitch
him
for
what
indeed
could
a
prince
do
with
a
princess
that
had
lost
her
gravity
who
could
tell
what
she
might
not
lose
next
she
might
lose
her
visibility
or
her
tangibility
or
in
short
the
power
of
making
impressions
upon
the
radical
sensorium
so
that
he
should
never
be
able
to
tell
whether
she
was
dead
or
alive
of
course
he
made
no
further
inquiries
about
her
one
day
he
lost
sight
of
his
retinue
in
a
great
forest
these
forests
are
very
useful
in
delivering
princes
from
their
courtiers
like
a
sieve
that
keeps
back
the
bran
then
the
princes
get
away
to
follow
their
fortunes
in
this
they
have
the
advantage
of
the
princesses
who
are
forced
to
marry
before
they
have
had
a
bit
of
fun
i
wish
our
princesses
got
lost
in
a
forest
sometimes
one
lovely
evening
after
wandering
about
for
many
days
he
found
that
he
was
approaching
the
outskirts
of
this
forest
for
the
trees
had
got
so
thin
that
he
could
see
the
sunset
through
them
and
he
soon
came
upon
a
kind
of
heath
next
he
came
upon
signs
of
human
neighbourhood
but
by
this
time
it
was
getting
late
and
there
was
nobody
in
the
fields
to
direct
him
after
travelling
for
another
hour
his
horse
quite
worn
out
with
long
labour
and
lack
of
food
fell
and
was
unable
to
rise
again
so
he
continued
his
journey
on
foot
at
length
he
entered
another
wood
not
a
wild
forest
but
a
civilized
wood
through
which
a
footpath
led
him
to
the
side
of
a
lake
along
this
path
the
prince
pursued
his
way
through
the
gathering
darkness
suddenly
he
paused
and
listened
strange
sounds
came
across
the
water
it
was
in
fact
the
princess
laughing
now
there
was
something
odd
in
her
laugh
as
i
have
already
hinted
for
the
hatching
of
a
real
hearty
laugh
requires
the
incubation
of
gravity
and
perhaps
this
was
how
the
prince
mistook
the
laughter
for
screaming
looking
over
the
lake
he
saw
something
white
in
the
water
and
in
an
instant
he
had
torn
off
his
tunic
kicked
off
his
sandals
and
plunged
in
he
soon
reached
the
white
object
and
found
that
it
was
a
woman
there
was
not
light
enough
to
show
that
she
was
a
princess
but
quite
enough
to
show
that
she
was
a
lady
for
it
does
not
want
much
light
to
see
that
now
i
can
not
tell
how
it
came
about
whether
she
pretended
to
be
drowning
or
whether
he
frightened
her
or
caught
her
so
as
to
embarrass
her
but
certainly
he
brought
her
to
shore
in
a
fashion
ignominious
to
a
swimmer
and
more
nearly
drowned
than
she
had
ever
expected
to
be
for
the
water
had
got
into
her
throat
as
often
as
she
had
tried
to
speak
at
the
place
to
which
he
bore
her
the
bank
was
only
a
foot
or
two
above
the
water
so
he
gave
her
a
strong
lift
out
of
the
water
to
lay
her
on
the
bank
but
her
gravitation
ceasing
the
moment
she
left
the
water
away
she
went
up
into
the
air
scolding
and
screaming
you
naughty
naughty
naughty
man
she
cried
no
one
had
ever
succeeded
in
putting
her
into
a
passion
when
the
prince
saw
her
ascend
he
thought
he
must
have
been
bewitched
and
have
mistaken
a
great
swan
for
a
lady
but
the
princess
caught
hold
of
the
topmost
cone
upon
a
lofty
fir
this
came
off
but
she
caught
at
another
and
in
fact
stopped
herself
by
gathering
cones
dropping
them
as
the
stocks
gave
way
the
prince
meantime
stood
in
the
water
staring
and
forgetting
to
get
out
but
the
princess
disappearing
he
scrambled
on
shore
and
went
in
the
direction
of
the
tree
there
he
found
her
climbing
down
one
of
the
branches
towards
the
stem
but
in
the
darkness
of
the
wood
the
prince
continued
in
some
bewilderment
as
to
what
the
phenomenon
could
be
until
reaching
the
ground
and
seeing
him
standing
there
she
caught
hold
of
him
and
said
i
tell
papa
oh
no
you
wo
returned
the
prince
yes
i
will
she
persisted
what
business
had
you
to
pull
me
down
out
of
the
water
and
throw
me
to
the
bottom
of
the
air
i
never
did
you
any
harm
pardon
me
i
did
not
mean
to
hurt
you
i
do
believe
you
have
any
brains
and
that
is
a
worse
loss
that
your
wretched
gravity
i
pity
you
the
prince
now
saw
that
he
had
come
upon
the
bewitched
princess
and
had
already
offended
her
but
before
he
could
think
what
to
say
next
she
burst
out
angrily
giving
a
stamp
with
her
foot
that
would
have
sent
her
aloft
again
but
for
the
hold
she
had
of
his
arm
put
me
up
directly
put
you
up
where
you
beauty
asked
the
prince
he
had
fallen
in
love
with
her
almost
already
for
her
anger
made
her
more
charming
than
any
one
else
had
ever
beheld
her
and
as
far
as
he
could
see
which
certainly
was
not
far
she
had
not
a
single
fault
about
her
except
of
course
that
she
had
not
any
gravity
no
prince
however
would
judge
of
a
princess
by
weight
the
loveliness
of
her
foot
he
would
hardly
estimate
by
the
depth
of
the
impression
it
could
make
in
the
mud
put
you
up
where
you
beauty
asked
the
prince
in
the
water
you
stupid
answered
the
princess
come
then
said
the
prince
the
condition
of
her
dress
increasing
her
usual
difficulty
in
walking
compelled
her
to
cling
to
him
and
he
could
hardly
persuade
himself
that
he
was
not
in
a
delightful
dream
notwithstanding
the
torrent
of
musical
abuse
with
which
she
overwhelmed
him
the
prince
being
therefore
in
no
hurry
they
came
upon
the
lake
at
quite
another
part
where
the
bank
was
feet
high
at
least
and
when
they
had
reached
the
edge
he
turned
towards
the
princess
and
said
how
am
i
to
put
you
in
that
is
your
business
she
answered
quite
snappishly
you
took
me
out
put
me
in
again
very
well
said
the
prince
and
catching
her
up
in
his
arms
he
sprang
with
her
from
the
rock
the
princess
had
just
time
to
give
one
delighted
shriek
of
laughter
before
the
water
closed
over
them
when
they
came
to
the
surface
she
found
that
for
a
moment
or
two
she
could
not
even
laugh
for
she
had
gone
down
with
such
a
rush
that
it
was
with
difficulty
she
recovered
her
breath
the
instant
they
reached
the
surface
how
do
you
like
falling
in
said
the
prince
after
some
effort
the
princess
panted
out
is
that
what
you
call
yes
answered
the
prince
i
should
think
it
a
very
tolerable
specimen
it
seemed
to
me
like
going
up
rejoined
she
my
feeling
was
certainly
one
of
elevation
too
the
prince
conceded
the
princess
did
not
appear
to
understand
him
for
she
retorted
his
question
how
do
like
falling
in
said
the
princess
beyond
everything
answered
he
for
i
have
fallen
in
with
the
only
perfect
creature
i
ever
saw
no
more
of
that
i
am
tired
of
it
said
the
princess
perhaps
she
shared
her
father
aversion
to
punning
do
you
like
falling
in
then
said
the
prince
it
is
the
most
delightful
fun
i
ever
had
in
my
life
answered
she
i
never
fell
before
i
wish
i
could
learn
to
think
i
am
the
only
person
in
my
father
kingdom
that
ca
fall
here
the
poor
princess
looked
almost
sad
i
shall
be
most
happy
to
fall
in
with
you
any
time
you
like
said
the
prince
devotedly
thank
you
i
do
know
perhaps
it
would
not
be
proper
but
i
care
at
all
events
as
we
have
fallen
in
let
us
have
a
swim
together
with
all
my
heart
responded
the
prince
and
away
they
went
swimming
and
diving
and
floating
until
at
last
they
heard
cries
along
the
shore
and
saw
lights
glancing
in
all
directions
it
was
now
quite
late
and
there
was
no
moon
i
must
go
home
said
the
princess
i
am
very
sorry
for
this
is
delightful
so
am
i
returned
the
prince
but
i
am
glad
i
have
a
home
to
go
to
at
least
i
do
exactly
know
where
it
is
i
wish
i
had
one
either
rejoined
the
princess
it
is
so
stupid
i
have
a
great
mind
she
continued
to
play
them
all
a
trick
why
could
they
leave
me
alone
they
wo
trust
me
in
the
lake
for
a
single
night
you
see
where
that
green
light
is
burning
that
is
the
window
of
my
room
now
if
you
would
just
swim
there
with
me
very
quietly
and
when
we
are
all
but
under
the
balcony
give
me
such
a
push
you
call
it
as
you
did
a
little
while
ago
i
should
be
able
to
catch
hold
of
the
balcony
and
get
in
at
the
window
and
then
they
may
look
for
me
till
morning
with
more
obedience
than
pleasure
said
the
prince
gallantly
and
away
they
swam
very
gently
will
you
be
in
the
lake
night
the
prince
ventured
to
ask
to
be
sure
i
will
i
do
think
so
perhaps
was
the
somewhat
strange
answer
but
the
prince
was
intelligent
enough
not
to
press
her
further
and
merely
whispered
as
he
gave
her
the
parting
lift
do
tell
the
only
answer
the
princess
returned
was
a
roguish
look
she
was
already
a
yard
above
his
head
the
look
seemed
to
say
never
fear
it
is
too
good
fun
to
spoil
that
way
so
perfectly
like
other
people
had
she
been
in
the
water
that
even
yet
the
prince
could
scarcely
believe
his
eyes
when
he
saw
her
ascend
slowly
grasp
the
balcony
and
disappear
through
the
window
he
turned
almost
expecting
to
see
her
still
by
his
side
but
he
was
alone
in
the
water
so
he
swam
away
quietly
and
watched
the
lights
roving
about
the
shore
for
hours
after
the
princess
was
safe
in
her
chamber
as
soon
as
they
disappeared
he
landed
in
search
of
his
tunic
and
sword
and
after
some
trouble
found
them
again
then
he
made
the
best
of
his
way
round
the
lake
to
the
other
side
there
the
wood
was
wilder
and
the
shore
steeper
rising
more
immediately
towards
the
mountains
which
surrounded
the
lake
on
all
sides
and
kept
sending
it
messages
of
silvery
streams
from
morning
to
night
and
all
night
long
he
soon
found
a
spot
whence
he
could
see
the
green
light
in
the
room
and
where
even
in
the
broad
daylight
he
would
be
in
no
danger
of
being
discovered
from
the
opposite
shore
it
was
a
sort
of
cave
in
the
rock
where
he
provided
himself
a
bed
of
withered
leaves
and
lay
down
too
tired
for
hunger
to
keep
him
awake
all
night
long
he
dreamed
that
he
was
swimming
with
the
princess
x
look
at
the
moon
early
the
next
morning
the
prince
set
out
to
look
for
something
to
eat
which
he
soon
found
at
a
forester
hut
where
for
many
following
days
he
was
supplied
with
all
that
a
brave
prince
could
consider
necessary
and
having
plenty
to
keep
him
alive
for
the
present
he
would
not
think
of
wants
not
yet
in
existence
whenever
care
intruded
this
prince
always
bowed
him
out
in
the
most
princely
manner
when
he
returned
from
his
breakfast
to
his
he
saw
the
princess
already
floating
about
in
the
lake
attended
by
the
king
or
queen
whom
he
knew
by
their
crowns
and
a
great
company
in
lovely
little
boats
with
canopies
of
all
the
colours
of
the
rainbow
and
flags
and
streamers
of
a
great
many
more
it
was
a
very
bright
day
and
soon
the
prince
burned
up
with
the
heat
began
to
long
for
the
cold
water
and
the
cool
princess
but
he
had
to
endure
till
twilight
for
the
boats
had
provisions
on
board
and
it
was
not
till
the
sun
went
down
that
the
gay
party
began
to
vanish
boat
after
boat
drew
away
to
the
shore
following
that
of
the
king
and
queen
till
only
one
apparently
the
princess
own
boat
remained
but
she
did
not
want
to
go
home
even
yet
and
the
prince
thought
he
saw
her
order
the
boat
to
the
shore
without
her
at
all
events
it
rowed
away
and
now
of
all
the
radiant
company
only
one
white
speck
remained
then
the
prince
began
to
sing
and
this
is
what
he
sang
lady
fair
lift
thine
eyes
banish
night
by
the
might
of
thine
eyes
snowy
arms
oars
of
snow
oar
her
hither
plashing
low
soft
and
slow
oar
her
hither
stream
behind
her
the
lake
radiant
whiteness
in
her
wake
following
following
for
her
sake
radiant
whiteness
cling
about
her
waters
blue
part
not
from
her
but
renew
cold
and
true
kisses
round
her
lap
me
round
waters
sad
that
have
left
her
make
me
glad
for
ye
had
kissed
her
ere
ye
left
her
before
he
had
finished
his
song
the
princess
was
just
under
the
place
where
he
sat
and
looking
up
to
find
him
her
ears
had
led
her
truly
would
you
like
a
fall
princess
said
the
prince
looking
down
ah
there
you
are
yes
if
you
please
prince
said
the
princess
looking
up
how
do
you
know
i
am
a
prince
princess
said
the
prince
because
you
are
a
very
nice
young
man
prince
said
the
princess
come
up
then
princess
fetch
me
prince
the
prince
took
off
his
scarf
then
his
then
his
tunic
and
tied
them
all
together
and
let
them
down
but
the
line
was
far
too
short
he
unwound
his
turban
and
added
it
to
the
rest
when
it
was
all
but
long
enough
and
his
purse
completed
it
the
princess
just
managed
to
lay
hold
of
the
knot
of
money
and
was
beside
him
in
a
moment
this
rock
was
much
higher
than
the
other
and
the
splash
and
the
dive
were
tremendous
the
princess
was
in
ecstasies
of
delight
and
their
swim
was
delicious
night
after
night
they
met
and
swam
about
in
the
dark
clear
lake
where
such
was
the
prince
gladness
that
whether
the
princess
way
of
looking
at
things
infected
him
or
he
was
actually
getting
he
often
fancied
that
he
was
swimming
in
the
sky
instead
of
the
lake
but
when
he
talked
about
being
in
heaven
the
princess
laughed
at
him
dreadfully
when
the
moon
came
she
brought
them
fresh
pleasure
everything
looked
strange
and
new
in
her
light
with
an
old
withered
yet
unfading
newness
when
the
moon
was
nearly
full
one
of
their
great
delights
was
to
dive
deep
in
the
water
and
then
turning
round
look
up
through
it
at
the
great
blot
of
light
close
above
them
shimmering
and
trembling
and
wavering
spreading
and
contracting
seeming
to
melt
away
and
again
grow
solid
then
they
would
shoot
up
through
the
blot
and
lo
there
was
the
moon
far
off
clear
and
steady
and
cold
and
very
lovely
at
the
bottom
of
a
deeper
and
bluer
lake
than
theirs
as
the
princess
said
the
prince
soon
found
out
that
while
in
the
water
the
princess
was
very
like
other
people
and
besides
this
she
was
not
so
forward
in
her
questions
or
pert
in
her
replies
at
sea
as
on
shore
neither
did
she
laugh
so
much
and
when
she
did
laugh
it
was
more
gently
she
seemed
altogether
more
modest
and
maidenly
in
the
water
than
out
of
it
but
when
the
prince
who
had
really
fallen
in
love
when
he
fell
in
the
lake
began
to
talk
to
her
about
love
she
always
turned
her
head
towards
him
and
laughed
after
a
while
she
began
to
look
puzzled
as
if
she
were
trying
to
understand
what
he
meant
but
could
not
revealing
a
notion
that
he
meant
something
but
as
soon
as
ever
she
left
the
lake
she
was
so
altered
that
the
prince
said
to
himself
if
i
marry
her
i
see
no
help
for
it
we
must
turn
merman
and
mermaid
and
go
out
to
sea
at
once
xi
hiss
the
princess
pleasure
in
the
lake
had
grown
to
a
passion
and
she
could
scarcely
bear
to
be
out
of
it
for
an
hour
imagine
then
her
consternation
when
diving
with
the
prince
one
night
a
sudden
suspicion
seized
her
that
the
lake
was
not
so
deep
as
it
used
to
be
the
prince
could
not
imagine
what
had
happened
she
shot
to
the
surface
and
without
a
word
swam
at
full
speed
towards
the
higher
side
of
the
lake
he
followed
begging
to
know
if
she
was
ill
or
what
was
the
matter
she
never
turned
her
head
or
took
the
smallest
notice
of
his
question
arrived
at
the
shore
she
coasted
the
rocks
with
minute
inspection
but
she
was
not
able
to
come
to
a
conclusion
for
the
moon
was
very
small
and
so
she
could
not
see
well
she
turned
therefore
and
swam
home
without
saying
a
word
to
explain
her
conduct
to
the
prince
of
whose
presence
she
seemed
no
longer
conscious
he
withdrew
to
his
cave
in
great
perplexity
and
distress
next
day
she
made
many
observations
which
alas
strengthened
her
fears
she
saw
that
the
banks
were
too
dry
and
that
the
grass
on
the
shore
and
the
trailing
plants
on
the
rocks
were
withering
away
she
caused
marks
to
be
made
along
the
borders
and
examined
them
day
after
day
in
all
directions
of
the
wind
till
at
last
the
horrible
idea
became
a
certain
fact
that
the
surface
of
the
lake
was
slowly
sinking
the
poor
princess
nearly
went
out
of
the
little
mind
she
had
it
was
awful
to
her
to
see
the
lake
which
she
loved
more
than
any
living
thing
lie
dying
before
her
eyes
it
sank
away
slowly
vanishing
the
tops
of
rocks
that
had
never
been
seen
till
now
began
to
appear
far
down
in
the
clear
water
before
long
they
were
dry
in
the
sun
it
was
fearful
to
think
of
the
mud
that
would
soon
lie
there
baking
and
festering
full
of
lovely
creatures
dying
and
ugly
creatures
coming
to
life
like
the
unmaking
of
a
world
and
how
hot
the
sun
would
be
without
any
lake
she
could
not
bear
to
swim
in
it
any
more
and
began
to
pine
away
her
life
seemed
bound
up
with
it
and
ever
as
the
lake
sank
she
pined
people
said
she
would
not
live
an
hour
after
the
lake
was
gone
but
she
never
cried
proclamation
was
made
to
all
the
kingdom
that
whosoever
should
discover
the
cause
of
the
lake
decrease
would
be
rewarded
after
a
princely
fashion
and
applied
themselves
to
their
physics
and
metaphysics
but
in
vain
not
even
they
could
suggest
a
cause
now
the
fact
was
that
the
old
princess
was
at
the
root
of
the
mischief
when
she
heard
that
her
niece
found
more
pleasure
in
the
water
than
anyone
else
out
of
it
she
went
into
a
rage
and
cursed
herself
for
her
want
of
foresight
but
said
she
i
will
soon
set
all
right
the
king
and
the
people
shall
die
of
thirst
their
brains
shall
boil
and
frizzle
in
their
skulls
before
i
will
lose
my
revenge
and
she
laughed
a
ferocious
laugh
that
made
the
hairs
on
the
back
of
her
black
cat
stand
erect
with
terror
then
she
went
to
an
old
chest
in
the
room
and
opening
it
took
out
what
looked
like
a
piece
of
dried
seaweed
this
she
threw
into
a
tub
of
water
then
she
threw
some
powder
into
the
water
and
stirred
it
with
her
bare
arm
muttering
over
it
words
of
hideous
sound
and
yet
more
hideous
import
then
she
set
the
tub
aside
and
took
from
the
chest
a
huge
bunch
of
a
hundred
rusty
keys
that
clattered
in
her
shaking
hands
then
she
sat
down
and
proceeded
to
oil
them
all
before
she
had
finished
out
from
the
tub
the
water
of
which
had
kept
on
a
slow
motion
ever
since
she
had
ceased
stirring
it
came
the
head
and
half
the
body
of
a
huge
gray
snake
but
the
witch
did
not
look
round
it
grew
out
of
the
tub
waving
itself
backwards
and
forwards
with
a
slow
horizontal
motion
till
it
reached
the
princess
when
it
laid
its
head
upon
her
shoulder
and
gave
a
low
hiss
in
her
ear
she
started
but
with
joy
and
seeing
the
head
resting
on
her
shoulder
drew
it
towards
her
and
kissed
it
then
she
drew
it
all
out
of
the
tub
and
wound
it
round
her
body
it
was
one
of
those
dreadful
creatures
which
few
have
ever
beheld
the
white
snakes
of
darkness
then
she
took
the
keys
and
went
down
to
her
cellar
and
as
she
unlocked
the
door
she
said
to
herself
this
worth
living
for
locking
the
door
behind
her
she
descended
a
few
steps
into
the
cellar
and
crossing
it
unlocked
another
door
into
a
dark
narrow
passage
she
locked
this
also
behind
her
and
descended
a
few
more
steps
if
anyone
had
followed
the
he
would
have
heard
her
unlock
exactly
one
hundred
doors
and
descend
a
few
steps
after
unlocking
each
when
she
had
unlocked
the
last
she
entered
a
vast
cave
the
roof
of
which
was
supported
by
huge
natural
pillars
of
rock
now
this
roof
was
the
under
side
of
the
bottom
of
the
lake
she
then
untwined
the
snake
from
her
body
and
held
it
by
the
tail
high
above
her
the
hideous
creature
stretched
up
its
head
towards
the
roof
of
the
cavern
which
it
was
just
able
to
reach
it
then
began
to
move
its
head
backwards
and
forwards
with
a
slow
oscillating
motion
as
if
looking
for
something
at
the
same
moment
the
witch
began
to
walk
round
and
round
the
cavern
coming
nearer
to
the
centre
every
circuit
while
the
head
of
the
snake
described
the
same
path
over
the
roof
that
she
did
over
the
floor
for
she
kept
holding
it
up
and
still
it
kept
slowly
oscillating
round
and
round
the
cavern
they
went
ever
lessening
the
circuit
till
at
last
the
snake
made
a
sudden
dart
and
clung
to
the
roof
with
its
mouth
that
right
my
beauty
cried
the
princess
drain
it
dry
she
let
it
go
left
it
hanging
and
sat
down
on
a
great
stone
with
her
black
cat
which
had
followed
her
all
round
the
cave
by
her
side
then
she
began
to
knit
and
mutter
awful
words
the
snake
hung
like
a
huge
leech
sucking
at
the
stone
the
cat
stood
with
his
back
arched
and
his
tail
like
a
piece
of
cable
looking
up
at
the
snake
and
the
old
woman
sat
and
knitted
and
muttered
seven
days
and
seven
nights
they
remained
thus
when
suddenly
the
serpent
dropped
from
the
roof
as
if
exhausted
and
shrivelled
up
till
it
was
again
like
a
piece
of
dried
seaweed
the
witch
started
to
her
feet
picked
it
up
put
it
in
her
pocket
and
looked
up
at
the
roof
one
drop
of
water
was
trembling
on
the
spot
where
the
snake
had
been
sucking
as
soon
as
she
saw
that
she
turned
and
fled
followed
by
her
cat
shutting
the
door
in
a
terrible
hurry
she
locked
it
and
having
muttered
some
frightful
words
sped
to
the
next
which
also
she
locked
and
muttered
over
and
so
with
all
the
hundred
doors
till
she
arrived
in
her
own
cellar
there
she
sat
down
on
the
floor
ready
to
faint
but
listening
with
malicious
delight
to
the
rushing
of
the
water
which
she
could
hear
distinctly
through
all
the
hundred
doors
but
this
was
not
enough
now
that
she
had
tasted
revenge
she
lost
her
patience
without
further
measures
the
lake
would
be
too
long
in
disappearing
so
the
next
night
with
the
last
shred
of
the
dying
old
moon
rising
she
took
some
of
the
water
in
which
she
had
revived
the
snake
put
it
in
a
bottle
and
set
out
accompanied
by
her
cat
before
morning
she
had
made
the
entire
circuit
of
the
lake
muttering
fearful
words
as
she
crossed
every
stream
and
casting
into
it
some
of
the
water
out
of
her
bottle
when
she
had
finished
the
circuit
she
muttered
yet
again
and
flung
a
handful
of
water
towards
the
moon
thereupon
every
spring
in
the
country
ceased
to
throb
and
bubble
dying
away
like
the
pulse
of
a
dying
man
the
next
day
there
was
no
sound
of
falling
water
to
be
heard
along
the
borders
of
the
lake
the
very
courses
were
dry
and
the
mountains
showed
no
silvery
streaks
down
their
dark
sides
and
not
alone
had
the
fountains
of
mother
earth
ceased
to
flow
for
all
the
babies
throughout
the
country
were
crying
dreadfully
only
without
tears
xii
where
is
the
prince
never
since
the
night
when
the
princess
left
him
so
abruptly
had
the
prince
had
a
single
interview
with
her
he
had
seen
her
once
or
twice
in
the
lake
but
as
far
as
he
could
discover
she
had
not
been
in
it
any
more
at
night
he
had
sat
and
sung
and
looked
in
vain
for
his
nereid
while
she
like
a
true
nereid
was
wasting
away
with
her
lake
sinking
as
it
sank
withering
as
it
dried
when
at
length
he
discovered
the
change
that
was
taking
place
in
the
level
of
the
water
he
was
in
great
alarm
and
perplexity
he
could
not
tell
whether
the
lake
was
dying
because
the
lady
had
forsaken
it
or
whether
the
lady
would
not
come
because
the
lake
had
begun
to
sink
but
he
resolved
to
know
so
much
at
least
he
disguised
himself
and
going
to
the
palace
requested
to
see
the
lord
chamberlain
his
appearance
at
once
gained
his
request
and
the
lord
chamberlain
being
a
man
of
some
insight
perceived
that
there
was
more
in
the
prince
solicitation
than
met
the
ear
he
felt
likewise
that
no
one
could
tell
whence
a
solution
of
the
present
difficulties
might
arise
so
he
granted
the
prince
prayer
to
be
made
to
the
princess
it
was
rather
cunning
in
the
prince
to
request
such
an
easy
post
for
the
princess
could
not
possibly
soil
as
many
shoes
as
other
princesses
he
soon
learned
all
that
could
be
learned
about
the
princess
he
went
nearly
distracted
but
after
roaming
about
the
lake
for
days
and
diving
in
every
depth
that
remained
all
that
he
could
do
was
to
put
an
extra
polish
on
the
dainty
pair
of
boots
that
was
never
called
for
for
the
princess
kept
her
room
with
the
curtains
drawn
to
shut
out
the
dying
lake
but
she
could
not
shut
it
out
of
her
mind
for
a
moment
it
haunted
her
imagination
so
that
she
felt
as
if
the
lake
were
her
soul
drying
up
within
her
first
to
mud
then
to
madness
and
death
she
thus
brooded
over
the
change
with
all
its
dreadful
accompaniments
till
she
was
nearly
distracted
as
for
the
prince
she
had
forgotten
him
however
much
she
had
enjoyed
his
company
in
the
water
she
did
not
care
for
him
without
it
but
she
seemed
to
have
forgotten
her
father
and
mother
too
the
lake
went
on
sinking
small
slimy
spots
began
to
appear
which
glittered
steadily
amidst
the
changeful
shine
of
the
water
these
grew
to
broad
patches
of
mud
which
widened
and
spread
with
rocks
here
and
there
and
floundering
fishes
and
crawling
eels
swarming
the
people
went
everywhere
catching
these
and
looking
for
anything
that
might
have
dropped
from
the
royal
boats
at
length
the
lake
was
all
but
gone
only
a
few
of
the
deepest
pools
remaining
unexhausted
it
happened
one
day
that
a
party
of
youngsters
found
themselves
on
the
brink
of
one
of
these
pools
in
the
very
centre
of
the
lake
it
was
a
rocky
basin
of
considerable
depth
looking
in
they
saw
at
the
bottom
something
that
shone
yellow
in
the
sun
a
little
boy
jumped
in
and
dived
for
it
it
was
a
plate
of
gold
covered
with
writing
they
carried
it
to
the
king
on
one
side
of
it
stood
these
words
death
alone
from
death
can
save
love
is
death
and
so
is
brave
love
can
fill
the
deepest
grave
love
loves
on
beneath
the
wave
now
this
was
enigmatical
enough
to
the
king
and
courtiers
but
the
reverse
of
the
plate
explained
it
a
little
its
writing
amounted
to
this
if
the
lake
should
disappear
they
must
find
the
hole
through
which
the
water
ran
but
it
would
be
useless
to
try
to
stop
it
by
any
ordinary
means
there
was
but
one
effectual
the
body
of
a
living
man
could
alone
stanch
the
flow
the
man
must
give
himself
of
his
own
will
and
the
lake
must
take
his
life
as
it
filled
otherwise
the
offering
would
be
of
no
avail
if
the
nation
could
not
provide
one
hero
it
was
time
it
should
perish
xiii
here
i
am
this
was
a
very
disheartening
revelation
to
the
king
not
that
he
was
unwilling
to
sacrifice
a
subject
but
that
he
was
hopeless
of
finding
a
man
willing
to
sacrifice
himself
no
time
was
to
be
lost
however
for
the
princess
was
lying
motionless
on
her
bed
and
taking
no
nourishment
but
which
was
now
none
of
the
best
therefore
the
king
caused
the
contents
of
the
wonderful
plate
of
gold
to
be
published
throughout
the
country
no
one
however
came
forward
the
prince
having
gone
several
days
journey
into
the
forest
to
consult
a
hermit
whom
he
had
met
there
on
his
way
to
lagobel
knew
nothing
of
the
oracle
till
his
return
when
he
had
acquainted
himself
with
all
the
particulars
he
sat
down
and
thought
she
will
die
if
i
do
do
it
and
life
would
be
nothing
to
me
without
her
so
i
shall
lose
nothing
by
doing
it
and
life
will
be
as
pleasant
to
her
as
ever
for
she
will
soon
forget
me
and
there
will
be
so
much
more
beauty
and
happiness
in
the
world
to
be
sure
i
shall
not
see
it
here
the
poor
prince
gave
a
sigh
how
lovely
the
lake
will
be
in
the
moonlight
with
that
glorious
creature
sporting
in
it
like
a
wild
goddess
it
is
rather
hard
to
be
drowned
by
inches
though
let
me
see
that
will
be
seventy
inches
of
me
to
drown
here
he
tried
to
laugh
but
could
not
the
longer
the
better
however
he
resumed
for
can
i
not
bargain
that
the
princess
shall
be
beside
me
all
the
time
so
i
shall
see
her
once
more
kiss
her
perhaps
who
knows
and
die
looking
in
her
eyes
it
will
be
no
death
at
least
i
shall
not
feel
it
and
to
see
the
lake
filling
for
the
beauty
again
all
right
i
am
ready
he
kissed
the
princess
boot
laid
it
down
and
hurried
to
the
apartment
but
feeling
as
he
went
that
anything
sentimental
would
be
disagreeable
he
resolved
to
carry
off
the
whole
affair
with
nonchalance
so
he
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
king
where
it
was
all
but
a
capital
crime
to
disturb
him
when
the
king
heard
the
knock
he
started
up
and
opened
the
door
in
a
rage
seeing
only
the
shoeblack
he
drew
his
sword
this
i
am
sorry
to
say
was
his
usual
mode
of
asserting
his
regality
when
he
thought
his
dignity
was
in
danger
but
the
prince
was
not
in
the
least
alarmed
please
your
majesty
i
your
butler
said
he
my
butler
you
lying
rascal
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
i
will
cork
your
big
bottle
is
the
fellow
mad
bawled
the
king
raising
the
point
of
his
sword
i
will
put
a
stopper
plug
what
you
call
it
in
your
leaky
lake
grand
monarch
said
the
prince
the
king
was
in
such
a
rage
that
before
he
could
speak
he
had
time
to
cool
and
to
reflect
that
it
would
be
great
waste
to
kill
the
only
man
who
was
willing
to
be
useful
in
the
present
emergency
seeing
that
in
the
end
the
insolent
fellow
would
be
as
dead
as
if
he
had
died
by
his
majesty
own
hand
oh
said
he
at
last
putting
up
his
sword
with
difficulty
it
was
so
long
i
am
obliged
to
you
you
young
fool
take
a
glass
of
wine
no
thank
you
replied
the
prince
very
well
said
the
king
would
you
like
to
run
and
see
your
parents
before
you
make
your
experiment
no
thank
you
said
the
prince
then
we
will
go
and
look
for
the
hole
at
once
said
his
majesty
and
proceeded
to
call
some
attendants
stop
please
your
majesty
i
have
a
condition
to
make
interposed
the
prince
what
exclaimed
the
king
a
condition
and
with
me
how
dare
you
as
you
please
returned
the
prince
coolly
i
wish
your
majesty
a
good
morning
you
wretch
i
will
have
you
put
in
a
sack
and
stuck
in
the
hole
very
well
your
majesty
replied
the
prince
becoming
a
little
more
respectful
lest
the
wrath
of
the
king
should
deprive
him
of
the
pleasure
of
dying
for
the
princess
but
what
good
will
that
do
your
majesty
please
to
remember
that
the
oracle
says
the
victim
must
offer
himself
well
you
offered
yourself
retorted
the
king
yes
upon
one
condition
condition
again
roared
the
king
once
more
drawing
his
sword
begone
somebody
else
will
be
glad
enough
to
take
the
honour
off
your
shoulders
your
majesty
knows
it
will
not
be
easy
to
get
another
to
take
my
place
well
what
is
your
condition
growled
the
king
feeling
that
the
prince
was
right
only
this
replied
the
prince
that
as
i
must
on
no
account
die
before
i
am
fairly
drowned
and
the
waiting
will
be
rather
wearisome
the
princess
your
daughter
shall
go
with
me
feed
me
with
her
own
hands
and
look
at
me
now
and
then
to
comfort
me
for
you
must
confess
it
rather
hard
as
soon
as
the
water
is
up
to
my
eyes
she
may
go
and
be
happy
and
forget
her
poor
shoeblack
here
the
prince
voice
faltered
and
he
very
nearly
grew
sentimental
in
spite
of
his
resolution
why
did
you
tell
me
before
what
your
condition
was
such
a
fuss
about
nothing
exclaimed
the
king
do
you
grant
it
persisted
the
prince
of
course
i
do
replied
the
king
very
well
i
am
ready
go
and
have
some
dinner
then
while
i
set
my
people
to
find
the
place
the
king
ordered
out
his
guards
and
gave
directions
to
the
officers
to
find
the
hole
in
the
lake
at
once
so
the
bed
of
the
lake
was
marked
out
in
divisions
and
thoroughly
examined
and
in
an
hour
or
so
the
hole
was
discovered
it
was
in
the
middle
of
a
stone
near
the
centre
of
the
lake
in
the
very
pool
where
the
golden
plate
had
been
found
it
was
a
hole
of
no
great
size
there
was
water
all
round
the
stone
but
very
little
was
flowing
through
the
hole
xiv
this
is
very
kind
of
you
the
prince
went
to
dress
for
the
occasion
for
he
was
resolved
to
die
like
a
prince
when
the
princess
heard
that
a
man
had
offered
to
die
for
her
she
was
so
transported
that
she
jumped
off
the
bed
feeble
as
she
was
and
danced
about
the
room
for
joy
she
did
not
care
who
the
man
was
that
was
nothing
to
her
the
hole
wanted
stopping
and
if
only
a
man
would
do
why
take
one
in
an
hour
or
two
more
everything
was
ready
her
maid
dressed
her
in
haste
and
they
carried
her
to
the
side
of
the
lake
when
she
saw
it
she
shrieked
and
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
they
bore
her
across
to
the
stone
where
they
had
already
placed
a
little
boat
for
her
the
water
was
not
deep
enough
to
float
it
but
they
hoped
it
would
be
before
long
they
laid
her
on
cushions
placed
in
the
boat
wines
and
fruits
and
other
nice
things
and
stretched
a
canopy
over
all
in
a
few
minutes
the
prince
appeared
the
princess
recognized
him
at
once
but
did
not
think
it
worth
while
to
acknowledge
him
here
i
am
said
the
prince
put
me
in
they
told
me
it
was
a
shoeblack
said
the
princess
so
i
am
said
the
prince
i
blacked
your
little
boots
three
times
a
day
because
they
were
all
i
could
get
of
you
put
me
in
the
courtiers
did
not
resent
his
bluntness
except
by
saying
to
each
other
that
he
was
taking
it
out
in
impudence
but
how
was
he
to
be
put
in
the
golden
plate
contained
no
instructions
on
this
point
the
prince
looked
at
the
hole
and
saw
but
one
way
he
put
both
his
legs
into
it
sitting
on
the
stone
and
stooping
forward
covered
the
corner
that
remained
open
with
his
two
hands
in
this
uncomfortable
position
he
resolved
to
abide
his
fate
and
turning
to
the
people
said
now
you
can
go
the
king
had
already
gone
home
to
dinner
now
you
can
go
repeated
the
princess
after
him
like
a
parrot
the
people
obeyed
her
and
went
presently
a
little
wave
flowed
over
the
stone
and
wetted
one
of
the
prince
knees
but
he
did
not
mind
it
much
he
began
to
sing
and
the
song
he
sung
was
this
as
a
world
that
has
no
well
darkly
bright
in
forest
dell
as
a
world
without
the
gleam
of
the
stream
as
a
world
without
the
glance
of
the
ocean
fair
expanse
as
a
world
where
never
rain
glittered
on
the
sunny
plain
such
my
heart
thy
world
would
be
if
no
love
did
flow
in
thee
as
a
world
without
the
sound
of
the
rivulets
underground
or
the
bubbling
of
the
spring
out
of
darkness
wandering
or
the
mighty
rush
and
flowing
of
the
river
downward
going
or
the
that
drop
on
the
outspread
beech
top
or
the
ocean
mighty
voice
when
his
lifted
waves
rejoice
such
my
soul
thy
world
would
be
if
no
love
did
sing
in
thee
lady
keep
thy
world
delight
keep
the
waters
in
thy
sight
love
hath
made
me
strong
to
go
for
thy
sake
to
realms
below
where
the
water
shine
and
hum
through
the
darkness
never
come
let
i
pray
one
thought
of
me
spring
a
little
well
in
thee
lest
thy
loveless
soul
be
found
like
a
dry
and
thirsty
ground
sing
again
prince
it
makes
it
less
tedious
said
the
princess
but
the
prince
was
too
much
overcome
to
sing
any
more
and
a
long
pause
followed
this
is
very
kind
of
you
prince
said
the
princess
at
last
quite
coolly
as
she
lay
in
the
boat
with
her
eyes
shut
i
am
sorry
i
ca
return
the
compliment
thought
the
prince
but
you
are
worth
dying
for
after
all
again
a
wavelet
and
another
and
another
flowed
over
the
stone
and
wetted
both
the
prince
knees
but
he
did
not
speak
or
move
two
three
four
hours
passed
in
this
way
the
princess
apparently
asleep
and
the
prince
very
patient
but
he
was
much
disappointed
in
his
position
for
he
had
none
of
the
consolation
he
had
hoped
for
at
last
he
could
bear
it
no
longer
princess
said
he
but
at
the
moment
up
started
the
princess
crying
i
afloat
i
afloat
and
the
little
boat
bumped
against
the
stone
princess
repeated
the
prince
encouraged
by
seeing
her
wide
awake
and
looking
eagerly
at
the
water
well
said
she
without
looking
round
your
papa
promised
that
you
should
look
at
me
and
you
have
looked
at
me
once
did
he
then
i
suppose
i
must
but
i
am
so
sleepy
sleep
then
darling
and
do
mind
me
said
the
poor
prince
really
you
are
very
good
replied
the
princess
i
think
i
will
go
to
sleep
again
just
give
me
a
glass
of
wine
and
a
biscuit
first
said
the
prince
very
humbly
with
all
my
heart
said
the
princess
and
gaped
as
she
said
it
she
got
the
wine
and
the
biscuit
however
and
leaning
over
the
side
of
the
boat
towards
him
was
compelled
to
look
at
him
why
prince
she
said
you
do
look
well
are
you
sure
you
mind
it
not
a
bit
answered
he
feeling
very
faint
in
deed
only
i
shall
die
before
it
is
of
any
use
to
you
unless
i
have
something
to
eat
there
then
said
she
holding
out
the
wine
to
him
ah
you
must
feed
me
i
dare
not
move
my
hands
the
water
would
run
away
directly
good
gracious
said
the
princess
and
she
began
at
once
to
feed
him
with
bits
of
biscuit
and
sips
of
wine
as
she
fed
him
he
contrived
to
kiss
the
tips
of
her
fingers
now
and
then
she
did
not
seem
to
mind
it
one
way
or
the
other
but
the
prince
felt
better
now
for
your
own
sake
princess
said
he
i
can
not
let
you
go
to
sleep
you
must
sit
and
look
at
me
else
i
shall
not
be
able
to
keep
up
well
i
will
do
anything
i
can
to
oblige
you
answered
she
with
condescension
and
sitting
down
she
did
look
at
him
and
kept
looking
at
him
with
wonderful
steadiness
considering
all
things
the
sun
went
down
and
the
moon
rose
and
gush
after
gush
the
waters
were
rising
up
the
prince
body
they
were
up
to
his
waist
now
why
ca
we
go
and
have
a
swim
said
the
princess
there
seems
to
be
water
enough
just
about
here
i
shall
never
swim
more
said
the
prince
oh
i
forgot
said
the
princess
and
was
silent
so
the
water
grew
and
grew
and
rose
up
and
up
on
the
prince
and
the
princess
sat
and
looked
at
him
she
fed
him
now
and
then
the
night
wore
on
the
waters
rose
and
rose
the
moon
rose
likewise
higher
and
higher
and
shone
full
on
the
face
of
the
dying
prince
the
water
was
up
to
his
neck
will
you
kiss
me
princess
said
he
feebly
the
nonchalance
was
all
gone
now
yes
i
will
answered
the
princess
and
kissed
him
with
a
long
sweet
cold
kiss
now
said
he
with
a
sigh
of
content
i
die
happy
he
did
not
speak
again
the
princess
gave
him
some
wine
for
the
last
time
he
was
past
eating
then
she
sat
down
again
and
looked
at
him
the
water
rose
and
rose
it
touched
his
chin
it
touched
his
lower
lip
it
touched
between
his
lips
he
shut
them
hard
to
keep
it
out
the
princess
began
to
feel
strange
it
touched
his
upper
lip
he
breathed
through
his
nostrils
the
princess
looked
wild
it
covered
his
nostrils
her
eyes
looked
scared
and
shone
strange
in
the
moonlight
his
head
fell
back
the
water
closed
over
it
and
the
bubbles
of
his
last
breath
bubbled
up
through
the
water
the
princess
gave
a
shriek
and
sprang
into
the
lake
she
laid
hold
first
of
one
leg
and
then
of
the
other
and
pulled
and
tugged
but
she
could
not
move
either
she
stopped
to
take
breath
and
that
made
her
think
that
he
could
not
get
any
breath
she
was
frantic
she
got
hold
of
him
and
held
his
head
above
the
water
which
was
possible
now
his
hands
were
no
longer
on
the
hole
but
it
was
of
no
use
for
he
was
past
breathing
love
and
water
brought
back
all
her
strength
she
got
under
the
water
and
pulled
and
pulled
with
her
whole
might
till
at
last
she
got
one
leg
out
the
other
easily
followed
how
she
got
him
into
the
boat
she
never
could
tell
but
when
she
did
she
fainted
away
coming
to
herself
she
seized
the
oars
kept
herself
steady
as
best
she
could
and
rowed
and
rowed
though
she
had
never
rowed
before
round
rocks
and
over
shallows
and
through
mud
she
rowed
till
she
got
to
the
of
the
palace
by
this
time
her
people
were
on
the
shore
for
they
had
heard
her
shriek
she
made
them
carry
the
prince
to
her
own
room
and
lay
him
in
her
bed
and
light
a
fire
and
send
for
the
doctors
but
the
lake
your
highness
said
the
chamberlain
who
roused
by
the
noise
came
in
in
his
nightcap
go
and
drown
yourself
in
it
she
said
this
was
the
last
rudeness
of
which
the
princess
was
ever
guilty
and
one
must
allow
that
she
had
good
cause
to
feel
provoked
with
the
lord
chamberlain
had
it
been
the
king
himself
he
would
have
fared
no
better
but
both
he
and
the
queen
were
fast
asleep
and
the
chamberlain
went
back
to
his
bed
somehow
the
doctors
never
came
so
the
princess
and
her
old
nurse
were
left
with
the
prince
but
the
old
nurse
was
a
wise
woman
and
knew
what
to
do
they
tried
everything
for
a
long
time
without
success
the
princess
was
nearly
distracted
between
hope
and
fear
but
she
tried
on
and
on
one
thing
after
another
and
everything
over
and
over
again
at
last
when
they
had
all
but
given
it
up
just
as
the
sun
rose
the
prince
opened
his
eyes
xv
look
at
the
rain
the
princess
burst
into
a
passion
of
tears
and
on
the
floor
there
she
lay
for
an
hour
and
her
tears
never
ceased
all
the
crying
of
her
life
was
spent
now
and
a
rain
came
on
such
as
had
never
been
seen
in
that
country
the
sun
shone
all
the
time
and
the
great
drops
which
fell
straight
to
the
earth
shone
likewise
the
palace
was
in
the
heart
of
a
rainbow
it
was
a
rain
of
rubies
and
sapphires
and
emeralds
and
topazes
the
torrents
poured
from
the
mountains
like
molten
gold
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
its
subterraneous
outlet
the
lake
would
have
overflowed
and
inundated
the
country
it
was
full
from
shore
to
shore
but
the
princess
did
not
heed
the
lake
she
lay
on
the
floor
and
wept
and
this
rain
within
doors
was
far
more
wonderful
than
the
rain
out
of
doors
for
when
it
abated
a
little
and
she
proceeded
to
rise
she
found
to
her
astonishment
that
she
could
not
at
length
after
many
efforts
she
succeeded
in
getting
upon
her
feet
but
she
tumbled
down
again
directly
hearing
her
fall
her
old
nurse
uttered
a
yell
of
delight
and
ran
to
her
screaming
my
darling
child
she
found
her
gravity
oh
that
it
is
it
said
the
princess
rubbing
her
shoulder
and
her
knee
alternately
i
consider
it
very
unpleasant
i
feel
as
if
i
should
be
crushed
to
pieces
hurrah
cried
the
prince
from
the
bed
if
you
come
round
princess
so
have
i
how
the
lake
brimful
answered
the
nurse
then
we
all
happy
that
we
are
indeed
answered
the
princess
sobbing
and
there
was
rejoicing
all
over
the
country
that
rainy
day
even
the
babies
forgot
their
past
troubles
and
danced
and
crowed
amazingly
and
the
king
told
stories
and
the
queen
listened
to
them
and
he
divided
the
money
in
his
box
and
she
the
honey
in
her
pot
to
all
the
children
and
there
was
such
jubilation
as
was
never
heard
of
before
of
course
the
prince
and
princess
were
betrothed
at
once
but
the
princess
had
to
learn
to
walk
before
they
could
be
married
with
any
propriety
and
this
was
not
so
easy
at
her
time
of
life
for
she
could
walk
no
more
than
a
baby
she
was
always
falling
down
and
hurting
herself
is
this
the
gravity
you
used
to
make
so
much
of
said
she
one
day
to
the
prince
as
he
raised
her
from
the
floor
for
my
part
i
was
a
great
deal
more
comfortable
without
it
no
no
that
not
it
this
is
it
replied
the
prince
as
he
took
her
up
and
carried
her
about
like
a
baby
kissing
her
all
the
time
this
is
gravity
that
better
said
she
i
do
mind
that
so
much
and
she
smiled
the
sweetest
loveliest
smile
in
the
prince
face
and
she
gave
him
one
little
kiss
in
return
for
all
his
and
he
thought
them
overpaid
for
he
was
beside
himself
with
delight
i
fear
she
complained
of
her
gravity
more
than
once
after
this
notwithstanding
it
was
a
long
time
before
she
got
reconciled
to
walking
but
the
pain
of
learning
it
was
quite
counterbalanced
by
two
things
either
of
which
would
have
been
sufficient
consolation
the
first
was
that
the
prince
himself
was
her
teacher
and
the
second
that
she
could
tumble
into
the
lake
as
often
as
she
pleased
still
she
preferred
to
have
the
prince
jump
in
with
her
and
the
splash
they
made
before
was
nothing
to
the
splash
they
made
now
the
lake
never
sank
again
in
process
of
time
it
wore
the
roof
of
the
cavern
quite
through
and
was
twice
as
deep
as
before
the
only
revenge
the
princess
took
upon
her
aunt
was
to
tread
pretty
hard
on
her
gouty
toe
the
next
time
she
saw
her
but
she
was
sorry
for
it
the
very
next
day
when
she
heard
that
the
water
had
undermined
her
house
and
that
it
had
fallen
in
the
night
burying
her
in
its
ruins
whence
no
one
ever
ventured
to
dig
up
her
body
there
she
lies
to
this
day
so
the
prince
and
princess
lived
and
were
happy
and
had
crowns
of
gold
and
clothes
of
cloth
and
shoes
of
leather
and
children
of
boys
and
girls
not
one
of
whom
was
ever
known
on
the
most
critical
occasion
to
lose
the
smallest
atom
of
his
or
her
due
proportion
of
gravity
the
giant
heart
there
was
once
a
giant
who
lived
on
the
borders
of
giantland
where
it
touched
on
the
country
of
common
people
everything
in
giantland
was
so
big
that
the
common
people
saw
only
a
mass
of
awful
mountains
and
clouds
and
no
living
man
had
ever
come
from
it
as
far
as
anybody
knew
to
tell
what
he
had
seen
in
it
somewhere
near
these
borders
on
the
other
side
by
the
edge
of
a
great
forest
lived
a
labourer
with
his
wife
and
a
great
many
children
one
day
as
they
called
her
teased
her
brother
till
he
could
not
bear
it
any
longer
and
gave
her
a
box
on
the
ear
cried
and
was
so
sorry
and
so
ashamed
of
himself
that
he
cried
too
and
ran
off
into
the
wood
he
was
so
long
gone
that
began
to
be
frightened
for
she
was
very
fond
of
her
brother
and
she
was
so
distressed
that
she
had
first
teased
him
and
then
cried
that
at
last
she
ran
into
the
wood
to
look
for
him
though
there
was
more
chance
of
losing
herself
than
of
finding
him
and
indeed
so
it
seemed
likely
to
turn
out
for
running
on
without
looking
she
at
length
found
herself
in
a
valley
she
knew
nothing
about
and
no
wonder
for
what
she
thought
was
a
valley
with
round
rocky
sides
was
no
other
than
the
space
between
two
of
the
roots
of
a
great
tree
that
grew
on
the
borders
of
giantland
she
climbed
over
the
side
of
it
and
went
towards
what
she
took
for
a
black
mountain
far
away
but
which
she
soon
discovered
to
be
close
to
her
and
to
be
a
hollow
place
so
great
that
she
could
not
tell
what
it
was
hollowed
out
of
staring
at
it
she
found
that
it
was
a
doorway
and
going
nearer
and
staring
harder
she
saw
the
door
far
in
with
a
knocker
of
iron
upon
it
a
great
many
yards
above
her
head
and
as
large
as
the
anchor
of
a
big
ship
now
nobody
had
ever
been
unkind
to
and
therefore
she
was
not
afraid
of
anybody
for
box
on
the
ear
she
did
not
think
worth
considering
so
spying
a
little
hole
at
the
bottom
of
the
door
which
had
been
nibbled
by
some
giant
mouse
she
crept
through
it
and
found
herself
in
an
enormous
hall
she
could
not
have
seen
the
other
end
of
it
at
all
except
for
the
great
fire
that
was
burning
there
diminished
to
a
spark
in
the
distance
towards
this
fire
she
ran
as
fast
as
she
could
and
was
not
far
from
it
when
something
fell
before
her
with
a
great
clatter
over
which
she
tumbled
and
went
rolling
on
the
floor
she
was
not
much
hurt
however
and
got
up
in
a
moment
then
she
saw
that
what
she
had
fallen
over
was
not
unlike
a
great
iron
bucket
when
she
examined
it
more
closely
she
discovered
that
it
was
a
thimble
and
looking
up
to
see
who
had
dropped
it
beheld
a
huge
face
with
spectacles
as
big
as
the
round
windows
in
a
church
bending
over
her
and
looking
everywhere
for
the
thimble
immediately
laid
hold
of
it
in
both
her
arms
and
lifted
it
about
an
inch
nearer
to
the
nose
of
the
peering
giantess
this
movement
made
the
old
lady
see
where
it
was
and
her
finger
popping
into
it
it
vanished
from
the
eyes
of
buried
in
the
folds
of
a
white
stocking
like
a
cloud
in
the
sky
which
mrs
giant
was
busy
darning
for
it
was
saturday
night
and
her
husband
would
wear
nothing
but
white
stockings
on
sunday
to
be
sure
he
did
eat
little
children
but
only
little
ones
and
if
ever
it
crossed
his
mind
that
it
was
wrong
to
do
so
he
always
said
to
himself
that
he
wore
whiter
stockings
on
sunday
than
any
other
giant
in
all
giantland
at
the
same
instant
heard
a
sound
like
the
wind
in
a
tree
full
of
leaves
and
could
not
think
what
it
could
be
till
looking
up
she
found
that
it
was
the
giantess
whispering
to
her
and
when
she
tried
very
hard
she
could
hear
what
she
said
well
enough
run
away
dear
little
girl
she
said
as
fast
as
you
can
for
my
husband
will
be
home
in
a
few
minutes
but
i
never
been
naughty
to
your
husband
said
looking
up
in
the
giantess
face
that
does
matter
you
had
better
go
he
is
fond
of
little
children
particularly
little
girls
oh
then
he
wo
hurt
me
i
am
not
sure
of
that
he
is
so
fond
of
them
that
he
eats
them
up
and
i
am
afraid
he
could
help
hurting
you
a
little
he
a
very
good
man
though
oh
then
began
feeling
rather
frightened
but
before
she
could
finish
her
sentence
she
heard
the
sound
of
footsteps
very
far
apart
and
very
heavy
the
next
moment
who
should
come
running
towards
her
full
speed
and
as
pale
as
death
but
she
held
out
her
arms
and
he
ran
into
them
but
when
she
tried
to
kiss
him
she
only
kissed
the
back
of
his
head
for
his
white
face
and
round
eyes
were
turned
to
the
door
run
children
run
and
hide
said
the
giantess
come
buffy
said
tricksey
yonder
a
great
brake
we
hide
in
it
the
brake
was
a
big
broom
and
they
had
just
got
into
the
bristles
of
it
when
they
heard
the
door
open
with
a
sound
of
thunder
and
in
stalked
the
giant
you
would
have
thought
you
saw
the
whole
earth
through
the
door
when
he
opened
it
so
wide
was
it
and
when
he
closed
it
it
was
like
nightfall
where
is
that
little
boy
he
cried
with
a
voice
like
the
bellowing
of
a
cannon
he
looked
a
very
nice
boy
indeed
i
am
almost
sure
he
crept
through
the
mousehole
at
the
bottom
of
the
door
where
is
he
my
dear
i
do
know
answered
the
giantess
but
you
know
it
is
wicked
to
tell
lies
do
you
my
dear
retorted
the
giant
now
you
ridiculous
old
thunderthump
said
his
wife
with
a
smile
as
broad
as
the
sea
in
the
sun
how
can
i
mend
your
white
stockings
and
look
after
little
boys
you
have
got
plenty
to
last
you
over
sunday
i
am
sure
just
look
what
good
little
boys
they
are
and
peered
through
the
bristles
and
discovered
a
row
of
little
boys
about
a
dozen
with
very
fat
faces
and
goggle
eyes
sitting
before
the
fire
and
looking
stupidly
into
it
thunderthump
intended
the
most
of
these
for
pickling
and
was
feeding
them
well
before
salting
them
now
and
then
however
he
could
not
keep
his
teeth
off
them
and
would
eat
one
by
the
bye
without
salt
he
strode
up
to
the
wretched
children
now
what
made
them
very
wretched
indeed
was
that
they
knew
if
they
could
only
keep
from
eating
and
grow
thin
the
giant
would
dislike
them
and
turn
them
out
to
find
their
way
home
but
notwithstanding
this
so
greedy
were
they
that
they
ate
as
much
as
ever
they
could
hold
the
giantess
who
fed
them
comforted
herself
with
thinking
that
they
were
not
real
boys
and
girls
but
only
little
pigs
pretending
to
be
boys
and
girls
now
tell
me
the
truth
cried
the
giant
bending
his
face
down
over
them
they
shook
with
terror
and
every
one
hoped
it
was
somebody
else
the
giant
liked
best
where
is
the
little
boy
that
ran
into
the
hall
just
now
whoever
tells
me
a
lie
shall
be
instantly
boiled
he
in
the
broom
cried
one
boy
he
in
there
and
a
little
girl
with
him
the
naughty
children
cried
the
giant
to
hide
from
and
he
made
a
stride
towards
the
broom
catch
hold
of
the
bristles
bobby
get
right
into
a
tuft
and
hold
on
cried
just
in
time
the
giant
caught
up
the
broom
and
seeing
nothing
under
it
set
it
down
again
with
a
force
that
threw
them
both
on
the
floor
he
then
made
two
strides
to
the
boys
caught
the
one
by
the
neck
took
the
lid
off
a
great
pot
that
was
boiling
on
the
fire
popped
him
in
as
if
he
had
been
a
trussed
chicken
put
the
lid
on
again
and
saying
there
boys
see
what
comes
of
lying
asked
no
more
questions
for
as
he
always
kept
his
word
he
was
afraid
he
might
have
to
do
the
same
to
them
all
and
he
did
not
like
boiled
boys
he
like
to
eat
them
crisp
as
radishes
whether
forked
or
not
ought
to
be
eaten
he
then
sat
down
and
asked
his
wife
if
his
supper
was
ready
she
looked
into
the
pot
and
throwing
the
boy
out
with
the
ladle
as
if
he
had
been
a
black
beetle
that
had
tumbled
in
and
had
had
the
worst
of
it
answered
that
she
thought
it
was
whereupon
he
rose
to
help
her
and
taking
the
pot
from
the
fire
poured
the
whole
contents
bubbling
and
splashing
into
a
dish
like
a
vat
then
they
sat
down
to
supper
the
children
in
the
broom
could
not
see
what
they
had
but
it
seemed
to
agree
with
them
for
the
giant
talked
like
thunder
and
the
giantess
answered
like
the
sea
and
they
grew
chattier
and
chattier
at
length
the
giant
said
i
do
feel
quite
comfortable
about
that
heart
of
mine
and
as
he
spoke
instead
of
laying
his
hand
on
his
bosom
he
waved
it
away
towards
the
corner
where
the
children
were
peeping
from
the
like
frightened
little
mice
well
you
know
my
darling
thunderthump
answered
his
wife
i
always
thought
it
ought
to
be
nearer
home
but
you
know
best
of
course
ha
ha
you
do
know
where
it
is
wife
i
moved
it
a
month
ago
what
a
man
you
are
thunderthump
you
trust
any
creature
alive
rather
than
your
wife
here
the
giantess
gave
a
sob
which
sounded
exactly
like
a
wave
going
flop
into
the
mouth
of
a
cave
up
to
the
roof
where
have
you
got
it
now
she
resumed
checking
her
emotion
well
doodlem
i
do
mind
telling
answered
the
giant
soothingly
the
great
has
got
it
for
a
nest
egg
she
sits
on
it
night
and
day
and
thinks
she
will
bring
the
greatest
eagle
out
of
it
that
ever
sharpened
his
beak
on
the
rocks
of
mount
skycrack
i
can
warrant
no
one
else
will
touch
it
while
she
has
got
it
but
she
is
rather
capricious
and
i
confess
i
am
not
easy
about
it
for
the
least
scratch
of
one
of
her
claws
would
do
for
me
at
once
and
she
claws
i
refer
anyone
who
doubts
this
part
of
my
story
to
certain
chronicles
of
giantland
preserved
among
the
celtic
nations
it
was
quite
a
common
thing
for
a
giant
to
put
his
heart
out
to
nurse
because
he
did
not
like
the
trouble
and
responsibility
of
doing
it
himself
although
i
must
confess
it
was
a
dangerous
sort
of
plan
to
take
especially
with
such
a
delicate
viscus
as
the
heart
all
this
time
and
were
listening
with
long
ears
oh
thought
if
i
could
but
find
the
giant
cruel
heart
would
i
give
it
a
squeeze
the
giant
and
giantess
went
on
talking
for
a
long
time
the
giantess
kept
advising
the
giant
to
hide
his
heart
somewhere
in
the
house
but
he
seemed
afraid
of
the
advantage
it
would
give
her
over
him
you
could
hide
it
at
the
bottom
of
the
said
she
that
would
make
me
feel
chokey
answered
he
well
in
the
or
in
the
that
the
place
no
one
would
think
of
looking
for
your
heart
in
the
worse
and
worse
cried
the
giant
well
the
suggested
she
no
no
it
would
grow
spongy
there
said
he
well
what
you
do
with
it
i
will
leave
it
a
month
longer
where
it
is
and
then
i
will
give
it
to
the
queen
of
the
kangaroos
and
she
will
carry
it
in
her
pouch
for
me
it
is
best
to
change
its
place
you
know
lest
my
enemies
should
scent
it
out
but
dear
doodlem
it
a
fretting
care
to
have
a
heart
of
one
own
to
look
after
the
responsibility
is
too
much
for
me
if
it
were
not
for
a
bite
of
a
radish
now
and
then
i
never
could
bear
it
here
the
giant
looked
lovingly
towards
the
row
of
little
boys
by
the
fire
all
of
whom
were
nodding
or
asleep
on
the
floor
why
do
you
trust
it
to
me
dear
thunderthump
said
his
wife
i
would
take
the
best
possible
care
of
it
i
do
doubt
it
my
love
but
the
responsibility
would
be
too
much
for
you
would
no
longer
be
my
darling
airy
laughing
doodlem
it
would
transform
you
into
a
heavy
oppressed
woman
weary
of
life
as
i
am
the
giant
closed
his
eyes
and
pretended
to
go
to
sleep
his
wife
got
his
stockings
and
went
on
with
her
darning
soon
the
giant
pretence
became
reality
and
the
giantess
began
to
nod
over
her
work
now
buffy
whispered
now
our
time
i
think
moonlight
and
we
had
better
be
off
there
a
door
with
a
hole
for
the
cat
just
behind
us
all
right
said
bob
i
ready
so
they
got
out
of
the
and
crept
to
the
door
but
to
their
great
disappointment
when
they
got
through
it
they
found
themselves
in
a
sort
of
shed
it
was
full
of
tubs
and
things
and
though
it
was
built
of
wood
only
they
could
not
find
a
crack
let
us
try
this
hole
said
tricksey
for
the
giant
and
giantess
were
sleeping
behind
them
and
they
dared
not
go
back
all
right
said
bob
he
seldom
said
anything
else
than
now
this
hole
was
in
a
mound
that
came
in
through
the
wall
of
the
shed
and
went
along
the
floor
for
some
distance
they
crawled
into
it
and
found
it
very
dark
but
groping
their
way
along
they
soon
came
to
a
small
crack
through
which
they
saw
grass
pale
in
the
moonshine
as
they
crept
on
they
found
the
hole
began
to
get
wider
and
lead
upwards
what
is
that
noise
of
rushing
said
i
ca
tell
replied
tricksey
for
you
see
i
do
know
what
we
are
in
the
fact
was
they
were
creeping
along
a
channel
in
the
heart
of
a
giant
tree
and
the
noise
they
heard
was
the
noise
of
the
sap
rushing
along
in
its
wooden
pipes
when
they
laid
their
ears
to
the
wall
they
heard
it
gurgling
along
with
a
pleasant
noise
it
sounds
kind
and
good
said
tricksey
it
is
water
running
now
it
must
be
running
from
somewhere
to
somewhere
i
think
we
had
better
go
on
and
we
shall
come
somewhere
it
was
now
rather
difficult
to
go
on
for
they
had
to
climb
as
if
they
were
climbing
a
hill
and
now
the
passage
was
wide
nearly
worn
out
they
saw
light
overhead
at
last
and
creeping
through
a
crack
into
the
open
air
found
themselves
on
the
fork
of
a
huge
tree
a
great
broad
uneven
space
lay
around
them
out
of
which
spread
boughs
in
every
direction
the
smallest
of
them
as
big
as
the
biggest
tree
in
the
country
of
common
people
overhead
were
leaves
enough
to
supply
all
the
trees
they
had
ever
seen
not
much
moonlight
could
come
through
but
the
leaves
would
glimmer
white
in
the
wind
at
times
the
tree
was
full
of
giant
birds
every
now
and
then
one
would
sweep
through
with
a
great
noise
but
except
an
occasional
chirp
sounding
like
a
shrill
pipe
in
a
great
organ
they
made
no
noise
all
at
once
an
owl
began
to
hoot
he
thought
he
was
singing
as
soon
as
he
began
other
birds
replied
making
rare
game
of
him
to
their
astonishment
the
children
found
they
could
understand
every
word
they
sang
and
what
they
sang
was
something
like
this
i
will
sing
a
song
i
the
owl
sing
a
song
you
ugly
fowl
what
will
you
sing
about
night
in
and
day
out
sing
about
the
night
i
the
owl
you
could
not
see
for
the
light
stupid
fowl
oh
the
moon
and
the
dew
and
the
shadows
the
owl
spread
out
his
silent
soft
sly
wings
and
lighting
between
and
nearly
smothered
them
closing
up
one
under
each
wing
it
was
like
being
buried
in
a
down
bed
but
the
owl
did
not
like
anything
between
his
sides
and
his
wings
so
he
opened
his
wings
again
and
the
children
made
haste
to
get
out
immediately
went
in
front
of
the
bird
and
looking
up
into
his
huge
face
which
was
as
round
as
the
eyes
of
the
giantess
spectacles
and
much
bigger
dropped
a
pretty
courtesy
and
said
please
owl
i
want
to
whisper
to
you
very
well
small
child
answered
the
owl
looking
important
and
stooping
his
ear
towards
her
what
is
it
please
tell
me
where
the
eagle
lives
that
sits
on
the
giant
heart
oh
you
naughty
child
that
a
secret
for
shame
and
with
a
great
hiss
that
terrified
them
the
owl
flew
into
the
tree
all
birds
are
fond
of
secrets
but
not
many
of
them
can
keep
them
so
well
as
the
owl
so
the
children
went
on
because
they
did
not
know
what
else
to
do
they
found
the
way
very
rough
and
difficult
the
tree
was
so
full
of
humps
and
hollows
now
and
then
they
plashed
into
a
pool
of
rain
now
and
then
they
came
upon
twigs
growing
out
of
the
trunk
where
they
had
no
business
and
they
were
as
large
as
poplars
sometimes
they
came
upon
great
cushions
of
soft
moss
and
on
one
of
them
they
lay
down
and
rested
but
they
had
not
lain
long
before
they
spied
a
large
nightingale
sitting
on
a
branch
with
its
bright
eyes
looking
up
at
the
moon
in
a
moment
more
he
began
to
sing
and
the
birds
about
him
began
to
reply
but
in
a
different
tone
from
that
in
which
they
had
replied
to
the
owl
oh
the
birds
did
call
the
nightingale
such
pretty
names
the
nightingale
sang
and
the
birds
replied
like
this
i
will
sing
a
song
i
the
nightingale
sing
a
song
long
long
little
neverfail
what
will
you
sing
about
light
in
or
light
out
sing
about
the
light
gone
away
down
away
and
out
of
sight
poor
lost
day
mourning
for
the
day
dead
his
dim
bed
the
nightingale
sang
so
sweetly
that
the
children
would
have
fallen
asleep
but
for
fear
of
losing
any
of
the
song
when
the
nightingale
stopped
they
got
up
and
wandered
on
they
did
not
know
where
they
were
going
but
they
thought
it
best
to
keep
going
on
because
then
they
might
come
upon
something
or
other
they
were
very
sorry
they
had
forgotten
to
ask
the
nightingale
about
the
eagle
nest
but
his
music
had
put
everything
else
out
of
their
heads
they
resolved
however
not
to
forget
the
next
time
they
had
a
chance
so
they
went
on
and
on
till
they
were
both
tired
and
said
at
last
trying
to
laugh
i
declare
my
legs
feel
just
like
a
dutch
doll
then
here
the
place
to
go
to
bed
in
said
they
stood
at
the
edge
of
a
last
year
nest
and
looked
down
with
delight
into
the
round
mossy
cave
then
they
crept
gently
in
and
lying
down
in
each
other
arms
found
it
so
deep
and
warm
and
comfortable
and
soft
that
they
were
soon
fast
asleep
now
close
beside
them
in
a
hollow
was
another
nest
in
which
lay
a
lark
and
his
wife
and
the
children
were
awakened
very
early
in
the
morning
by
a
dispute
between
and
lark
let
me
up
said
the
lark
it
is
not
time
said
the
lark
wife
it
is
said
the
lark
rather
rudely
the
darkness
is
quite
thin
i
can
almost
see
my
own
beak
nonsense
said
the
lark
wife
you
know
you
came
home
yesterday
morning
quite
worn
out
you
had
to
fly
so
very
high
before
you
saw
him
i
am
sure
he
would
not
mind
if
you
took
it
a
little
easier
do
be
quiet
and
go
to
sleep
again
that
not
it
at
all
said
the
lark
he
does
want
me
i
want
him
let
me
up
i
say
he
began
to
sing
and
and
having
now
learned
the
way
answered
him
i
will
sing
a
song
i
the
lark
sing
sing
little
what
will
you
sing
about
now
the
night
is
out
i
can
only
call
i
ca
think
let
me
up
that
all
let
me
drink
thirsting
all
the
long
night
for
a
drink
of
light
by
this
time
the
lark
was
standing
on
the
edge
of
his
nest
and
looking
at
the
children
poor
little
things
you
ca
fly
said
the
lark
no
but
we
can
look
up
said
tricksey
ah
you
do
know
what
it
is
to
see
the
very
first
of
the
sun
but
we
know
what
it
is
to
wait
till
he
comes
he
no
worse
for
your
seeing
him
first
is
he
oh
no
certainly
not
answered
the
lark
with
condescension
and
then
bursting
into
his
he
sprang
aloft
clapping
his
wings
like
a
clock
running
down
tell
us
where
began
but
the
lark
was
out
of
sight
his
song
was
all
that
was
left
of
him
that
was
everywhere
and
he
was
nowhere
selfish
bird
said
buffy
it
all
very
well
for
larks
to
go
hunting
the
sun
but
they
have
no
business
to
despise
their
neighbours
for
all
that
can
i
be
of
any
use
to
you
said
a
sweet
out
of
the
nest
this
was
the
lark
wife
who
stayed
at
home
with
the
young
larks
while
her
husband
went
to
church
oh
thank
you
if
you
please
answered
and
up
popped
a
pretty
brown
head
and
then
up
came
a
brown
feathery
body
and
last
of
all
came
the
slender
legs
on
to
the
edge
of
the
nest
there
she
turned
and
looking
down
into
the
nest
from
which
came
a
whole
litany
of
chirpings
for
breakfast
said
lie
still
little
ones
then
she
turned
to
the
children
my
husband
is
king
of
the
larks
she
said
took
off
his
cap
and
courtesied
very
low
oh
it
not
me
said
the
bird
looking
very
shy
i
am
only
his
wife
it
my
husband
and
she
looked
up
after
him
into
the
sky
whence
his
song
was
still
falling
like
a
shower
of
musical
hailstones
perhaps
could
see
him
he
a
splendid
bird
said
only
you
know
he
get
up
a
little
too
early
oh
no
he
does
it
only
his
way
you
know
but
tell
me
what
i
can
do
for
you
tell
us
please
lady
lark
where
the
lives
that
sits
on
giant
thunderthump
heart
oh
that
is
a
secret
did
you
promise
not
to
tell
no
but
larks
ought
to
be
discreet
they
see
more
than
other
birds
but
you
do
fly
up
high
like
your
husband
do
you
not
often
but
it
no
matter
i
come
to
know
things
for
all
that

tell
me
and

song

wings

i
will

song
i
learned
the
other
day
about
a
lark
and
his
wife
please

said
the
lark
wife
be
quiet
children
and
listen
was
very
glad
she
happened
to
know
a
song
which
would
please
the
lark
wife
at
least
whatever
the
lark
himself
might
have
thought
of
it
if
he
had
heard
it
so
she
sang
morrow
my
lord
in
the
sky
alone
sang
the
lark
as
the
sun
ascended
his
throne
on
me
my
lord
i
only

come
of
all
your
servants
to

to
catch
the
first
shine
of
your
golden
hair
i
thank
you
then
said
the
king
lark
for
flying
so
high
and
hating
the
dark
you
ask
a
full
cup
for
half
a
thirst
half
is
love
of
me
and
half
love
to
be
first
there
many
a
bird
that
makes
no
haste
but
waits
till
i
come
that
as
much
to
my
taste
and
the
king
hid
his
head
in
a
turban
of
cloud
and
the
lark
stopped
singing
quite
vexed
and
cowed
but
he
flew
up
higher
and
thought
the
wrath
of
the
king
will
be
over
and
gone
and
his
crown
shining
out
of
its
cloudy
fold
will
change
my
brown
feathers
to
a
glory
of
gold
so
he
flew
with
the
strength
of
a
lark
he
flew
but
as
he
rose
the
cloud
rose
too
and
not
a
gleam
of
the
golden
hair
came
through
the
depth
of
the
misty
air
till
weary
with
flying
with
sighing
sore
the
strong
could
do
no
more
his
wings
had
had
no
chrism
of
gold
and
his
feathers
felt
withered
and
worn
and
old
so
he
quivered
and
sank
and
dropped
like
a
stone
and
there
on
his
nest
where
he
left
her
alone
sat
his
little
wife
on
her
little
eggs
keeping
them
warm
with
wings
and
legs
did
i
say
alone
ah
no
such
thing
full
in
her
face
was
shining
the
king
sir
lark
you
look
tired
said
he
is
not
always
the
best
way
to
me
while
you
have
been
singing
so
high
and
away
i
been
shining
to
your
little
wife
all
day
he
had
set
his
crown
all
about
the
nest
and
out
of
the
midst
shone
her
little
brown
breast
and
so
glorious
was
she
in
russet
gold
that
for
wonder
and
awe
sir
lark
grew
cold
he
popped
his
head
under
her
wing
and
lay
as
still
as
a
stone
till
the
king
was
away
as
soon
as
had
finished
her
song
the
lark
wife
began
a
low
sweet
modest
little
song
of
her
own
and
after
she
had
piped
away
for
two
or
three
minutes
she
said
you
dear
children
what
can
i
do
for
you
tell
us
where
the
lives
please
said
well
i
do
think
there
can
be
much
harm
in
telling
such
wise
good
children
said
lady
lark
i
am
sure
you
do
want
to
do
any
mischief
oh
no
quite
the
contrary
said
then
i
tell
you
she
lives
on
the
very
topmost
peak
of
mount
skycrack
and
the
only
way
to
get
up
is
to
climb
on
the
spiders
webs
that
cover
it
from
top
to
bottom
that
rather
serious
said
but
you
do
want
to
go
up
you
foolish
little
thing
you
ca
go
and
what
do
you
want
to
go
up
for
that
is
a
secret
said
well
it
no
business
of
mine
rejoined
lady
lark
a
little
offended
and
quite
vexed
that
she
had
told
them
so
she
flew
away
to
find
some
breakfast
for
her
little
ones
who
by
this
time
were
chirping
very
impatiently
the
children
looked
at
each
other
joined
hands
and
walked
off
in
a
minute
more
the
sun
was
up
and
they
soon
reached
the
outside
of
the
tree
the
bark
was
so
knobby
and
rough
and
full
of
twigs
that
they
managed
to
get
down
though
not
without
great
difficulty
then
far
away
to
the
north
they
saw
a
huge
peak
like
the
spire
of
a
church
going
right
up
into
the
sky
they
thought
this
must
be
mount
skycrack
and
turned
their
faces
towards
it
as
they
went
on
they
saw
a
giant
or
two
now
and
then
striding
about
the
fields
or
through
the
woods
but
they
kept
out
of
their
way
nor
were
they
in
much
danger
for
it
was
only
one
or
two
of
the
border
giants
that
were
so
very
fond
of
children
at
last
they
came
to
the
foot
of
mount
skycrack
it
stood
in
a
plain
alone
and
shot
right
up
i
do
know
how
many
thousand
feet
into
the
air
a
long
narrow
spearlike
mountain
the
whole
face
of
it
from
top
to
bottom
was
covered
with
a
network
of
spiders
webs
with
threads
of
various
sizes
from
that
of
silk
to
that
of
whipcord
the
webs
shook
and
quivered
and
waved
in
the
sun
glittering
like
silver
all
about
ran
huge
greedy
spiders
catching
huge
silly
flies
and
devouring
them
here
they
sat
down
to
consider
what
could
be
done
the
spiders
did
not
heed
them
but
ate
away
at
the
now
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
and
all
round
it
was
a
ring
of
water
not
very
broad
but
very
deep
as
they
sat
watching
them
one
of
the
spiders
whose
web
was
woven
across
this
water
somehow
or
other
lost
his
hold
and
fell
in
on
his
back
and
ran
to
his
assistance
and
laying
hold
each
of
one
of
his
legs
succeeded
with
the
help
of
the
other
legs
which
struggled
spiderfully
in
getting
him
out
upon
dry
land
as
soon
as
he
had
shaken
himself
and
dried
himself
a
little
the
spider
turned
to
the
children
saying
and
now
what
can
i
do
for
you
tell
us
please
said
they
how
we
can
get
up
the
mountain
to
the
nest
nothing
is
easier
answered
the
spider
just
run
up
there
and
tell
them
all
i
sent
you
and
nobody
will
mind
you
but
we
have
got
claws
like
you
spider
said
buffy
ah
no
more
you
have
poor
unprovided
creatures
still
i
think
we
can
manage
it
come
home
with
me
you
wo
eat
us
will
you
said
buffy
my
dear
child
answered
the
spider
in
a
tone
of
injured
dignity
i
eat
nothing
but
what
is
mischievous
or
useless
you
have
helped
me
and
now
i
will
help
you
the
children
rose
at
once
and
climbing
as
well
as
they
could
reached
the
spider
nest
in
the
centre
of
the
web
nor
did
they
find
it
very
difficult
for
whenever
too
great
a
gap
came
the
spider
spinning
a
strong
cord
stretched
it
just
where
they
would
have
chosen
to
put
their
feet
next
he
left
them
in
his
nest
after
bringing
them
two
enormous
taken
from
bees
that
he
had
caught
but
presently
about
six
of
the
wisest
of
the
spiders
came
back
with
him
it
was
rather
horrible
to
look
up
and
see
them
all
round
the
mouth
of
the
nest
looking
down
on
them
in
contemplation
as
if
wondering
whether
they
would
be
nice
eating
at
length
one
of
them
said
tell
us
truly
what
you
want
with
the
eagle
and
we
will
try
to
help
you
then
told
them
that
there
was
a
giant
on
the
borders
who
treated
little
children
no
better
than
radishes
and
that
they
had
narrowly
escaped
being
eaten
by
him
that
they
had
found
out
that
the
great
of
mount
skycrack
was
at
present
sitting
on
his
heart
and
that
if
they
could
only
get
hold
of
the
heart
they
would
soon
teach
the
giant
better
behaviour
but
said
their
host
if
you
get
at
the
heart
of
the
giant
you
will
find
it
as
large
as
one
of
your
elephants
what
can
you
do
with
it
the
least
scratch
will
kill
it
replied
ah
but
you
might
do
better
than
that
said
the
now
we
have
resolved
to
help
you
here
is
a
little
bag
of
the
giants
can
not
bear
spiders
and
this
juice
is
dreadful
poison
to
them
we
are
all
ready
to
go
up
with
you
and
drive
the
eagle
away
then
you
must
put
the
heart
into
this
other
bag
and
bring
it
down
with
you
for
then
the
giant
will
be
in
your
power
but
how
can
we
do
that
said
buffy
the
bag
is
not
much
bigger
than
a
but
it
is
as
large
as
you
will
be
able
to
carry
yes
but
what
are
we
to
do
with
the
heart
put
it
in
the
bag
to
be
sure
only
first
you
must
squeeze
a
drop
out
of
the
other
bag
upon
it
you
will
see
what
will
happen
very
well
we
will
do
as
you
tell
us
said
and
now
if
you
please
how
shall
we
go
oh
that
our
business
said
the
first
spider
you
come
with
me
and
my
grandfather
will
take
your
brother
get
up
so
mounted
on
the
narrow
part
of
the
spider
back
and
held
fast
and
got
on
the
grandfather
back
and
up
they
scrambled
over
one
web
after
another
up
and
up
so
fast
and
every
spider
followed
so
that
when
looked
back
she
saw
a
whole
army
of
spiders
scrambling
after
them
what
can
we
want
with
so
many
she
thought
but
she
said
nothing
the
moon
was
now
up
and
it
was
a
splendid
sight
below
and
around
them
all
giantland
was
spread
out
under
them
with
its
great
hills
lakes
trees
and
animals
and
all
above
them
was
the
clear
heaven
and
mount
skycrack
rising
into
it
with
its
endless
ladders
of
glittering
like
cords
made
of
moonbeams
and
up
the
moonbeams
went
crawling
and
scrambling
and
racing
a
huge
army
of
huge
spiders
at
length
they
reached
all
but
the
very
summit
where
they
stopped
and
could
see
above
them
a
great
globe
of
feathers
that
finished
off
the
mountain
like
an
ornamental
knob
but
how
shall
we
drive
her
off
said
buffy
we
soon
manage
that
answered
the
come
on
you
down
there
up
rushed
the
whole
army
past
the
children
over
the
edge
of
the
nest
on
to
the
and
buried
themselves
in
her
feathers
in
a
moment
she
became
very
restless
and
went
pecking
about
with
her
beak
all
at
once
she
spread
out
her
wings
with
a
sound
like
a
whirlwind
and
flew
off
to
bathe
in
the
sea
and
then
the
spiders
began
to
drop
from
her
in
all
directions
on
their
gossamer
wings
the
children
had
to
hold
fast
to
keep
the
wind
of
the
eagle
flight
from
blowing
them
off
as
soon
as
it
was
over
they
looked
into
the
nest
and
there
lay
the
heart
an
awful
and
ugly
thing
make
haste
child
said
tricksey
spider
so
tricksey
took
her
bag
and
squeezed
a
drop
out
of
it
upon
the
heart
she
thought
she
heard
the
giant
give
a
roar
of
pain
and
she
nearly
fell
from
her
seat
with
terror
the
heart
instantly
began
to
shrink
it
shrunk
and
shrivelled
till
it
was
nearly
gone
and
caught
it
up
and
put
it
into
his
bag
then
the
two
spiders
turned
and
went
down
again
as
fast
as
they
could
before
they
got
to
the
bottom
they
heard
the
shrieks
of
the
over
the
loss
of
her
egg
but
the
spiders
told
them
not
to
be
alarmed
for
her
eyes
were
too
big
to
see
by
the
time
they
reached
the
foot
of
the
mountain
all
the
spiders
had
got
home
and
were
busy
again
catching
flies
as
if
nothing
had
happened
after
renewed
thanks
to
their
friends
the
children
set
off
carrying
the
giant
heart
with
them
if
you
should
find
it
at
all
troublesome
just
give
it
a
little
more
directly
said
the
grandfather
as
they
took
their
leave
now
the
giant
had
given
an
awful
roar
of
pain
the
moment
they
anointed
his
heart
and
had
fallen
down
in
a
fit
in
which
he
lay
so
long
that
all
the
boys
might
have
escaped
if
they
had
not
been
so
fat
one
did
and
got
home
in
safety
for
days
the
giant
was
unable
to
speak
the
first
words
he
uttered
were
oh
my
heart
my
heart
your
heart
is
safe
enough
dear
thunderstump
said
his
wife
really
a
man
of
your
size
ought
not
to
be
so
nervous
and
apprehensive
i
am
ashamed
of
you
you
have
no
heart
doodlem
answered
he
i
assure
you
that
at
this
moment
mine
is
in
the
greatest
danger
it
has
fallen
into
the
hands
of
foes
though
who
they
are
i
can
not
tell
here
he
fainted
again
for
finding
the
heart
begin
to
swell
a
little
had
given
it
the
least
touch
of
again
he
recovered
and
said
dear
doodlem
my
heart
is
coming
back
to
me
it
is
coming
nearer
and
nearer
after
lying
silent
for
hours
he
exclaimed
it
is
in
the
house
i
know
and
he
jumped
up
and
walked
about
looking
in
every
corner
as
he
rose
and
came
out
of
the
hole
in
the
and
through
the
in
the
door
and
walked
boldly
towards
the
giant
both
kept
their
eyes
busy
watching
him
led
by
the
love
of
his
own
heart
the
giant
soon
spied
them
and
staggered
furiously
towards
them
i
will
eat
you
you
vermin
he
cried
here
with
my
heart
tricksey
gave
the
heart
a
sharp
pinch
down
fell
the
giant
on
his
knees
blubbering
and
crying
and
begging
for
his
heart
you
shall
have
it
if
you
behave
yourself
properly
said
tricksey
how
shall
i
behave
myself
properly
asked
he
whimpering
take
all
those
boys
and
girls
and
carry
them
home
at
once
i
not
able
i
too
ill
i
should
fall
down
take
them
up
directly
i
ca
till
you
give
me
my
heart
very
well
said
tricksey
and
she
gave
the
heart
another
pinch
the
giant
jumped
to
his
feet
and
catching
up
all
the
children
thrust
some
into
his
waistcoat
pockets
some
into
his
breast
pocket
put
two
or
three
into
his
hat
and
took
a
bundle
of
them
under
each
arm
then
he
staggered
to
the
door
all
this
time
poor
doodlem
was
sitting
in
her
crying
and
mending
a
white
stocking
the
giant
led
the
way
to
the
borders
he
could
not
go
so
fast
but
that
buffy
and
tricksey
managed
to
keep
up
with
him
when
they
reached
the
borders
they
thought
it
would
be
safer
to
let
the
children
find
their
own
way
home
so
they
told
him
to
set
them
down
he
obeyed
have
you
put
them
all
down
mr
thunderthump
asked
yes
said
the
giant
that
a
lie
squeaked
a
little
voice
and
out
came
a
head
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
pinched
the
heart
till
the
giant
roared
with
pain
you
not
a
gentleman
you
tell
stories
she
said
he
was
the
thinnest
of
the
lot
said
thunderthump
crying
are
you
all
there
now
children
asked
tricksey
yes
returned
they
after
counting
themselves
very
carefully
and
with
some
difficulty
for
they
were
all
stupid
children
now
said
to
the
giant
will
you
promise
to
carry
off
no
more
children
and
never
to
eat
a
child
again
all
you
life
yes
yes
i
promise
answered
thunderthump
sobbing
and
you
will
never
cross
the
borders
of
giantland
never
and
you
shall
never
again
wear
white
stockings
on
a
sunday
all
your
life
do
you
promise
the
giant
hesitated
at
this
and
began
to
expostulate
but
believing
it
would
be
good
for
his
morals
insisted
and
the
giant
promised
then
she
required
of
him
that
when
she
gave
him
back
his
heart
he
should
give
it
to
his
wife
to
take
care
of
for
him
for
ever
after
the
poor
giant
fell
on
his
knees
and
began
again
to
beg
but
giving
the
heart
a
slight
pinch
he
bawled
out
yes
yes
doodlem
shall
have
it
i
swear
only
she
must
not
put
it
in
the
or
in
the
certainly
not
make
your
own
bargain
with
and
you
promise
not
to
interfere
with
my
brother
and
me
or
to
take
any
revenge
for
what
we
have
done
yes
yes
my
dear
children
i
promise
everything
do
pray
make
haste
and
give
me
back
my
poor
heart
wait
there
then
till
i
bring
it
to
you
yes
yes
only
make
haste
for
i
feel
very
faint
began
to
undo
the
mouth
of
the
bag
but
who
had
got
very
knowing
on
his
travels
took
out
his
knife
with
the
pretence
of
cutting
the
string
but
in
reality
to
be
prepared
for
any
emergency
no
sooner
was
the
heart
out
of
the
bag
than
it
expanded
to
the
size
of
a
bullock
and
the
giant
with
a
yell
of
rage
and
vengeance
rushed
on
the
two
children
who
had
stepped
sideways
from
the
terrible
heart
but
was
too
quick
for
thunderthump
he
sprang
to
the
heart
and
buried
his
knife
in
it
up
to
the
hilt
a
fountain
of
blood
spouted
from
it
and
with
a
dreadful
groan
the
giant
fell
dead
at
the
feet
of
little
who
could
not
help
being
sorry
for
him
after
all
the
golden
key
there
was
a
boy
who
used
to
sit
in
the
twilight
and
listen
to
his
stories
she
told
him
that
if
he
could
reach
the
place
where
the
end
of
the
rainbow
stands
he
would
find
there
a
golden
key
and
what
is
the
key
for
the
boy
would
ask
what
is
it
the
key
of
what
will
it
open
that
nobody
knows
his
aunt
would
reply
he
has
to
find
that
out
i
suppose
being
gold
the
boy
once
said
thoughtfully
that
i
could
get
a
good
deal
of
money
for
it
if
i
sold
it
better
never
find
it
than
sell
it
returned
his
aunt
and
then
the
boy
went
to
bed
and
dreamed
about
the
golden
key
now
all
that
his
told
the
boy
about
the
golden
key
would
have
been
nonsense
had
it
not
been
that
their
little
house
stood
on
the
borders
of
fairyland
for
it
is
perfectly
well
known
that
out
of
fairyland
nobody
ever
can
find
where
the
rainbow
stands
the
creature
takes
such
good
care
of
its
golden
key
always
flitting
from
place
to
place
lest
anyone
should
find
it
but
in
fairyland
it
is
quite
different
things
that
look
real
in
this
country
look
very
thin
indeed
in
fairyland
while
some
of
the
things
that
here
can
not
stand
still
for
a
moment
will
not
move
there
so
it
was
not
in
the
least
absurd
of
the
old
lady
to
tell
her
nephew
such
things
about
the
golden
key
did
you
ever
know
anybody
find
it
he
asked
one
evening
yes
your
father
i
believe
found
it
and
what
did
he
do
with
it
can
you
tell
me
he
never
told
me
what
was
it
like
he
never
showed
it
to
me
how
does
a
new
key
come
there
always
i
do
know
there
it
is
perhaps
it
is
the
rainbow
egg
perhaps
it
is
you
will
be
a
happy
boy
if
you
find
the
nest
perhaps
it
comes
tumbling
down
the
rainbow
from
the
sky
perhaps
it
does
one
evening
in
summer
he
went
into
his
own
room
and
stood
at
the
and
gazed
into
the
forest
which
fringed
the
outskirts
of
fairyland
it
came
close
up
to
his
garden
and
indeed
sent
some
straggling
trees
into
it
the
forest
lay
to
the
east
and
the
sun
which
was
setting
behind
the
cottage
looked
straight
into
the
dark
wood
with
his
level
red
eye
the
trees
were
all
old
and
had
few
branches
below
so
that
the
sun
could
see
a
great
way
into
the
forest
and
the
boy
being
could
see
almost
as
far
as
the
sun
the
trunks
stood
like
rows
of
red
columns
in
the
shine
of
the
red
sun
and
he
could
see
down
aisle
after
aisle
in
the
vanishing
distance
and
as
he
gazed
into
the
forest
he
began
to
feel
as
if
the
trees
were
all
waiting
for
him
and
had
something
they
could
not
go
on
with
till
he
came
to
them
but
he
was
hungry
and
wanted
his
supper
so
he
lingered
suddenly
far
among
the
trees
as
far
as
the
sun
could
shine
he
saw
a
glorious
thing
it
was
the
end
of
a
rainbow
large
and
brilliant
he
could
count
all
the
seven
colours
and
could
see
shade
after
shade
beyond
the
violet
while
before
the
red
stood
a
colour
more
gorgeous
and
mysterious
still
it
was
a
colour
he
had
never
seen
before
only
the
spring
of
the
was
visible
he
could
see
nothing
of
it
above
the
trees
the
golden
key
he
said
to
himself
and
darted
out
of
the
house
and
into
the
wood
he
had
not
gone
far
before
the
sun
set
but
the
rainbow
only
glowed
the
brighter
for
the
rainbow
of
fairyland
is
not
dependent
upon
the
sun
as
ours
is
the
trees
welcomed
him
the
bushes
made
way
for
him
the
rainbow
grew
larger
and
brighter
and
at
length
he
found
himself
within
two
trees
of
it
it
was
a
grand
sight
burning
away
there
in
silence
with
its
gorgeous
its
lovely
its
delicate
colours
each
distinct
all
combining
he
could
now
see
a
great
deal
more
of
it
it
rose
high
into
the
blue
heavens
but
bent
so
little
that
he
could
not
tell
how
high
the
crown
of
the
arch
must
reach
it
was
still
only
a
small
portion
of
a
huge
bow
he
stood
gazing
at
it
till
he
forgot
himself
with
delight
even
forgot
the
key
which
he
had
come
to
seek
and
as
he
stood
it
grew
more
wonderful
still
for
in
each
of
the
colours
which
was
as
large
as
the
column
of
a
church
he
could
faintly
see
beautiful
forms
slowly
ascending
as
if
by
the
steps
of
a
winding
stair
the
forms
appeared
irregularly
now
one
now
many
now
several
now
none
men
and
women
and
children
all
different
all
beautiful
he
drew
nearer
to
the
rainbow
it
vanished
he
started
back
a
step
in
dismay
it
was
there
again
as
beautiful
as
ever
so
he
contented
himself
with
standing
as
near
it
as
he
might
and
watching
the
forms
that
ascended
the
glorious
colours
towards
the
unknown
height
of
the
arch
which
did
not
end
abruptly
but
faded
away
in
the
blue
air
so
gradually
that
he
could
not
say
where
it
ceased
when
the
thought
of
the
golden
key
returned
the
boy
very
wisely
proceeded
to
mark
out
in
his
mind
the
space
covered
by
the
foundation
of
the
rainbow
in
order
that
he
might
know
where
to
search
should
the
rainbow
disappear
it
was
based
chiefly
upon
a
bed
of
moss
meantime
it
had
grown
quite
dark
in
the
wood
the
rainbow
alone
was
visible
by
its
own
light
but
the
moment
the
moon
rose
the
rainbow
vanished
nor
could
any
change
of
place
restore
the
vision
to
the
eyes
so
he
threw
himself
down
upon
the
mossy
bed
to
wait
till
the
sunlight
would
give
him
a
chance
of
finding
the
key
there
he
fell
fast
asleep
when
he
woke
in
the
morning
the
sun
was
looking
straight
into
his
eyes
he
turned
away
from
it
and
the
same
moment
saw
a
brilliant
little
thing
lying
on
the
moss
within
a
foot
of
his
face
it
was
the
golden
key
the
pipe
of
it
was
of
plain
gold
as
bright
as
gold
could
be
the
handle
was
curiously
wrought
and
set
with
sapphires
in
a
terror
of
delight
he
put
out
his
hand
and
took
it
and
had
it
he
lay
for
a
while
turning
it
over
and
over
and
feeding
his
eyes
upon
its
beauty
then
he
jumped
to
his
feet
remembering
that
the
pretty
thing
was
of
no
use
to
him
yet
where
was
the
lock
to
which
the
key
belonged
it
must
be
somewhere
for
how
could
anybody
be
so
silly
as
make
a
key
for
which
there
was
no
lock
where
should
he
go
to
look
for
it
he
gazed
about
him
up
into
the
air
down
to
the
earth
but
saw
no
keyhole
in
the
clouds
in
the
grass
or
in
the
trees
just
as
he
began
to
grow
disconsolate
however
he
saw
something
glimmering
in
the
wood
it
was
a
mere
glimmer
that
he
saw
but
he
took
it
for
a
glimmer
of
rainbow
and
went
towards
and
now
i
will
go
back
to
the
borders
of
the
forest
not
far
from
the
house
where
the
boy
had
lived
there
was
another
house
the
owner
of
which
was
a
merchant
who
was
much
away
from
home
he
had
lost
his
wife
some
years
before
and
had
only
one
child
a
little
girl
whom
he
left
to
the
charge
of
two
servants
who
were
very
idle
and
careless
so
she
was
neglected
and
left
untidy
and
was
sometimes
besides
now
it
is
well
known
that
the
little
creatures
commonly
called
fairies
though
there
are
many
different
kinds
of
fairies
in
fairyland
have
an
exceeding
dislike
to
untidiness
indeed
they
are
quite
spiteful
to
slovenly
people
being
used
to
all
the
lovely
ways
of
the
trees
and
flowers
and
to
the
neatness
of
the
birds
and
all
woodland
creatures
it
makes
them
feel
miserable
even
in
their
deep
woods
and
on
their
grassy
carpets
to
think
that
within
the
same
moonlight
lies
a
dirty
uncomfortable
slovenly
house
and
this
makes
them
angry
with
the
people
that
live
in
it
and
they
would
gladly
drive
them
out
of
the
world
if
they
could
they
want
the
whole
earth
nice
and
clean
so
they
pinch
the
maids
black
and
blue
and
play
them
all
manner
of
uncomfortable
tricks
but
this
house
was
quite
a
shame
and
the
fairies
in
the
forest
could
not
endure
it
they
tried
everything
on
the
maids
without
effect
and
at
last
resolved
upon
making
a
clean
riddance
beginning
with
the
child
they
ought
to
have
known
that
it
was
not
her
fault
but
they
have
little
principle
and
much
mischief
in
them
and
they
thought
that
if
they
got
rid
of
her
the
maids
would
be
sure
to
be
turned
away
so
one
evening
the
poor
little
girl
having
been
put
to
bed
early
before
the
sun
was
down
the
servants
went
off
to
the
village
locking
the
door
behind
them
the
child
did
not
know
she
was
alone
and
lay
contentedly
looking
out
of
her
window
towards
the
forest
of
which
however
she
could
not
see
much
because
of
the
ivy
and
other
creeping
plants
which
had
straggled
across
her
window
all
at
once
she
saw
an
ape
making
faces
at
her
out
of
the
mirror
and
the
heads
carved
upon
a
great
old
wardrobe
grinning
fearfully
then
two
old
chairs
came
forward
into
the
middle
of
the
room
and
began
to
dance
a
queer
dance
this
set
her
laughing
and
she
forgot
the
ape
and
the
grinning
heads
so
the
fairies
saw
they
had
made
a
mistake
and
sent
the
chairs
back
to
their
places
but
they
knew
that
she
had
been
reading
the
story
of
silverhair
all
day
so
the
next
moment
she
heard
the
voices
of
the
three
bears
upon
the
stair
big
voice
middle
voice
and
little
voice
and
she
heard
their
soft
heavy
tread
as
if
they
had
had
stockings
over
their
boots
coming
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
door
of
her
room
till
she
could
bear
it
no
longer
she
did
just
as
silverhair
did
and
as
the
fairies
wanted
her
to
do
she
darted
to
the
window
pulled
it
open
got
upon
the
ivy
and
so
scrambled
to
the
ground
she
then
fled
to
the
forest
as
fast
as
she
could
run
now
although
she
did
not
know
it
this
was
the
very
best
way
she
could
have
gone
for
nothing
is
ever
so
mischievous
in
its
own
place
as
it
is
out
of
it
and
besides
these
mischievous
creatures
were
only
the
children
of
fairyland
as
it
were
and
there
are
many
other
beings
there
as
well
and
if
a
wanderer
gets
in
among
them
the
good
ones
will
always
help
him
more
than
the
evil
ones
will
be
able
to
hurt
him
the
sun
was
now
set
and
the
darkness
coming
on
but
the
child
thought
of
no
danger
but
the
bears
behind
her
if
she
had
looked
round
however
she
would
have
seen
that
she
was
followed
by
a
very
different
creature
from
a
bear
it
was
a
curious
creature
made
like
a
fish
but
covered
instead
of
scales
with
feathers
of
all
colours
sparkling
like
those
of
a
it
had
fins
not
wings
and
swam
through
the
air
as
a
fish
does
through
the
water
its
head
was
like
the
head
of
a
small
owl
after
running
a
long
way
and
as
the
last
of
the
light
was
disappearing
she
passed
under
a
tree
with
drooping
branches
it
dropped
its
branches
to
the
ground
all
about
her
and
caught
her
as
in
a
trap
she
struggled
to
get
out
but
the
branches
pressed
her
closer
and
closer
to
the
trunk
she
was
in
great
terror
and
distress
when
the
swimming
into
the
thicket
of
branches
began
tearing
them
with
its
beak
they
loosened
their
hold
at
once
and
the
creature
went
on
attacking
them
till
at
length
they
let
the
child
go
then
the
came
from
behind
her
and
swam
on
in
front
glittering
and
sparkling
all
lovely
colours
and
she
followed
it
led
her
gently
along
till
all
at
once
it
swam
in
at
a
the
child
followed
still
there
was
a
bright
fire
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
upon
which
stood
a
pot
without
a
lid
full
of
water
that
boiled
and
bubbled
furiously
the
swam
straight
to
the
pot
and
into
the
boiling
water
where
it
lay
quiet
a
beautiful
woman
rose
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
fire
and
came
to
meet
the
girl
she
took
her
up
in
her
arms
and
said
ah
you
are
come
at
last
i
have
been
looking
for
you
a
long
time
she
sat
down
with
her
on
her
lap
and
there
the
girl
sat
staring
at
her
she
had
never
seen
anything
so
beautiful
she
was
tall
and
strong
with
white
arms
and
neck
and
a
delicate
flush
on
her
face
the
child
could
not
tell
what
was
the
colour
of
her
hair
but
could
not
help
thinking
it
had
a
tinge
of
dark
green
she
had
not
one
ornament
upon
her
but
she
looked
as
if
she
had
just
put
off
quantities
of
diamonds
and
emeralds
yet
here
she
was
in
the
simplest
poorest
little
cottage
where
she
was
evidently
at
home
she
was
dressed
in
shining
green
the
girl
looked
at
the
lady
and
the
lady
looked
at
the
girl
what
is
your
name
asked
the
lady
the
servants
always
call
me
tangle
ah
that
was
because
your
hair
was
so
untidy
but
that
was
their
fault
the
naughty
women
still
it
is
a
pretty
name
and
i
will
call
you
tangle
too
you
must
not
mind
my
asking
you
questions
for
you
may
ask
me
the
same
questions
every
one
of
them
and
any
others
that
you
like
how
old
are
you
ten
answered
tangle
you
do
look
like
it
said
the
lady
how
old
are
you
please
returned
tangle
thousands
of
years
old
answered
the
lady
you
do
look
like
it
said
tangle
do
i
i
think
i
do
do
you
see
how
beautiful
i
am
and
her
great
blue
eyes
looked
down
on
the
little
tangle
as
if
all
the
stars
in
the
sky
were
melted
in
them
to
make
their
brightness
ah
but
said
tangle
when
people
live
long
they
grow
old
at
least
i
always
thought
so
i
have
no
time
to
grow
old
said
the
lady
i
am
too
busy
for
that
it
is
very
idle
to
grow
but
i
can
not
have
my
little
girl
so
untidy
do
you
know
i
ca
find
a
clean
spot
on
your
face
to
kiss
perhaps
suggested
tangle
feeling
ashamed
but
not
too
much
so
to
say
a
word
for
herself
perhaps
that
is
because
the
tree
made
me
cry
so
my
poor
darling
said
the
lady
looking
now
as
if
the
moon
were
melted
in
her
eyes
and
kissing
her
little
face
dirty
as
it
was
the
naughty
tree
must
suffer
for
making
a
girl
cry
and
what
is
your
name
please
asked
tangle
grandmother
answered
the
lady
is
it
really
yes
indeed
i
never
tell
stories
even
in
fun
how
good
of
you
i
could
if
i
tried
it
would
come
true
if
i
said
it
and
then
i
should
be
punished
enough
and
she
smiled
like
the
sun
through
a
but
now
she
went
on
i
must
get
you
washed
and
dressed
and
then
we
shall
have
some
supper
oh
i
had
supper
long
ago
said
tangle
yes
indeed
you
had
answered
the
lady
three
years
ago
you
know
that
it
is
three
years
since
you
ran
away
from
the
bears
you
are
thirteen
and
more
now
tangle
could
only
stare
she
felt
quite
sure
it
was
true
you
will
not
be
afraid
of
anything
i
do
with
you
will
you
said
the
lady
i
will
try
very
hard
not
to
be
but
i
ca
be
certain
you
know
replied
tangle
i
like
your
saying
so
and
i
shall
be
quite
satisfied
answered
the
lady
she
took
off
the
girl
rose
with
her
in
her
arms
and
going
to
the
wall
of
the
cottage
opened
a
door
then
tangle
saw
a
deep
tank
the
sides
of
which
were
filled
with
green
plants
which
had
flowers
of
all
colours
there
was
a
roof
over
it
like
the
roof
of
the
cottage
it
was
filled
with
beautiful
clear
water
in
which
swam
a
multitude
of
such
fishes
as
the
one
that
had
led
her
to
the
cottage
it
was
the
light
their
colours
gave
that
showed
the
place
in
which
they
were
the
lady
spoke
some
words
tangle
could
not
understand
and
threw
her
into
the
tank
the
fishes
came
crowding
about
her
two
or
three
of
them
got
under
her
head
and
kept
it
up
the
rest
of
them
rubbed
themselves
all
over
her
and
with
their
wet
feathers
washed
her
quite
clean
then
the
lady
who
had
been
looking
on
all
the
time
spoke
again
whereupon
some
thirty
or
forty
of
the
fishes
rose
out
of
the
water
underneath
tangle
and
so
bore
her
up
to
the
arms
the
lady
held
out
to
take
her
she
carried
her
back
to
the
fire
and
having
dried
her
well
opened
a
chest
and
taking
out
the
finest
linen
garments
smelling
of
grass
and
lavender
put
them
upon
her
and
over
all
a
green
dress
just
like
her
own
shining
like
hers
and
soft
like
hers
and
going
into
just
such
lovely
folds
from
the
waist
where
it
was
tied
with
a
brown
cord
to
her
bare
feet
wo
you
give
me
a
pair
of
shoes
too
grandmother
said
tangle
no
my
dear
no
shoes
look
here
i
wear
no
shoes
so
saying
she
lifted
her
dress
a
little
and
there
were
the
loveliest
white
feet
but
no
shoes
then
tangle
was
content
to
go
without
shoes
too
and
the
lady
sat
down
with
her
again
and
combed
her
hair
and
brushed
it
and
then
left
it
to
dry
while
she
got
the
supper
first
she
got
bread
out
of
one
hole
in
the
wall
then
milk
out
of
another
then
several
kinds
of
fruit
out
of
a
third
and
then
she
went
to
the
pot
on
the
fire
and
took
out
the
fish
now
nicely
cooked
and
as
soon
as
she
had
pulled
off
its
feathered
skin
ready
to
be
eaten
but
exclaimed
tangle
and
she
stared
at
the
fish
and
could
say
no
more
i
know
what
you
mean
returned
the
lady
you
do
not
like
to
eat
the
messenger
that
brought
you
home
but
it
is
the
kindest
return
you
can
make
the
creature
was
afraid
to
go
until
it
saw
me
put
the
pot
on
and
heard
me
promise
it
should
be
boiled
the
moment
it
returned
with
you
then
it
darted
out
of
the
door
at
once
you
saw
it
go
into
the
pot
of
itself
the
moment
it
entered
did
you
not
i
did
answered
tangle
and
i
thought
it
very
strange
but
then
i
saw
you
and
forgot
all
about
the
fish
in
fairyland
resumed
the
lady
as
they
sat
down
to
the
table
the
ambition
of
the
animals
is
to
be
eaten
by
the
people
for
that
is
their
highest
end
in
that
condition
but
they
are
not
therefore
destroyed
out
of
that
pot
comes
something
more
than
the
dead
fish
you
will
see
tangle
now
remarked
that
the
lid
was
on
the
pot
but
the
lady
took
no
further
notice
of
it
till
they
had
eaten
the
fish
which
tangle
found
nicer
than
any
fish
she
had
ever
tasted
before
it
was
as
white
as
snow
and
as
delicate
as
cream
and
the
moment
she
had
swallowed
a
mouthful
of
it
a
change
she
could
not
describe
began
to
take
place
in
her
she
heard
a
murmuring
all
about
her
which
became
more
and
more
articulate
and
at
length
as
she
went
on
eating
grew
intelligible
by
the
time
she
had
finished
her
share
the
sounds
of
all
the
animals
in
the
forest
came
crowding
through
the
door
to
her
ears
for
the
door
still
stood
wide
open
though
it
was
pitch
dark
outside
and
they
were
no
longer
sounds
only
they
were
speech
and
speech
that
she
could
understand
she
could
tell
what
the
insects
in
the
cottage
were
saying
to
each
other
too
she
had
even
a
suspicion
that
the
trees
and
flowers
all
about
the
cottage
were
holding
midnight
communications
with
each
other
but
what
they
said
she
could
not
hear
as
soon
as
the
fish
was
eaten
the
lady
went
to
the
fire
and
took
the
lid
off
the
pot
a
lovely
little
creature
in
human
shape
with
large
white
wings
rose
out
of
it
and
flew
round
and
round
the
roof
of
the
cottage
then
dropped
fluttering
and
nestled
in
the
lap
of
the
lady
she
spoke
to
it
some
strange
words
carried
it
to
the
door
and
threw
it
out
into
the
darkness
tangle
heard
the
flapping
of
its
wings
die
away
in
the
distance
now
have
we
done
the
fish
any
harm
she
said
returning
no
answered
tangle
i
do
not
think
we
have
i
should
not
mind
eating
one
every
day
they
must
wait
their
time
like
you
and
me
too
my
little
tangle
and
she
smiled
a
smile
which
the
sadness
in
it
made
more
lovely
but
she
continued
i
think
we
may
have
one
for
supper
so
saying
she
went
to
the
door
of
the
tank
and
spoke
and
now
tangle
understood
her
perfectly
i
want
one
of
you
she
said
the
wisest
thereupon
the
fishes
got
together
in
the
middle
of
the
tank
with
their
heads
forming
a
circle
above
the
water
and
their
tails
a
larger
circle
beneath
it
they
were
holding
a
council
in
which
their
relative
wisdom
should
be
determined
at
length
one
of
them
flew
up
into
the
hand
looking
lively
and
ready
you
know
where
the
rainbow
stands
she
asked
yes
mother
quite
well
answered
the
fish
bring
home
a
young
man
you
will
find
there
who
does
not
know
where
to
go
the
fish
was
out
of
the
door
in
a
moment
then
the
lady
told
tangle
it
was
time
to
go
to
bed
and
opening
another
door
in
the
side
of
the
cottage
showed
her
a
little
arbour
cool
and
green
with
a
bed
of
purple
heath
growing
in
it
upon
which
she
threw
a
large
wrapper
made
of
the
feathered
skins
of
the
wise
fishes
shining
gorgeous
in
the
firelight
tangle
was
soon
lost
in
the
strangest
loveliest
dreams
and
the
beautiful
lady
was
in
every
one
of
her
dreams
in
the
morning
she
woke
to
the
rustling
of
leaves
over
her
head
and
the
sound
of
running
water
but
to
her
surprise
she
could
find
no
door
nothing
but
the
wall
of
the
cottage
so
she
crept
through
an
opening
in
the
arbour
and
stood
in
the
forest
then
she
bathed
in
a
stream
that
ran
merrily
through
the
trees
and
felt
happier
for
having
once
been
in
her
grandmother
pond
she
must
be
clean
and
tidy
ever
after
and
having
put
on
her
green
dress
felt
like
a
lady
she
spent
that
day
in
the
wood
listening
to
the
birds
and
beasts
and
creeping
things
she
understood
all
that
they
said
though
she
could
not
repeat
a
word
of
it
and
every
kind
had
a
different
language
while
there
was
a
common
though
more
limited
understanding
between
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
forest
she
saw
nothing
of
the
beautiful
lady
but
she
felt
that
she
was
near
her
all
the
time
and
she
took
care
not
to
go
out
of
sight
of
the
cottage
it
was
round
like
a
or
a
wigwam
and
she
could
see
neither
door
nor
window
in
it
the
fact
was
it
had
no
windows
and
though
it
was
full
of
doors
they
all
opened
from
the
inside
and
could
not
even
be
seen
from
the
outside
she
was
standing
at
the
foot
of
a
tree
in
the
twilight
listening
to
a
quarrel
between
a
mole
and
a
squirrel
in
which
the
mole
told
the
squirrel
that
the
tail
was
the
best
of
him
and
the
squirrel
called
the
mole
when
the
darkness
having
deepened
around
her
she
became
aware
of
something
shining
in
her
face
and
looking
round
saw
that
the
door
of
the
cottage
was
open
and
the
red
light
of
the
fire
flowing
from
it
like
a
river
through
the
darkness
she
left
mole
and
squirrel
to
settle
matters
as
they
might
and
darted
off
to
the
cottage
entering
she
found
the
pot
boiling
on
the
fire
and
the
grand
lovely
lady
sitting
on
the
other
side
of
it
i
been
watching
you
all
day
said
the
lady
you
shall
have
something
to
eat
by
and
by
but
we
must
wait
till
our
supper
comes
home
she
took
tangle
on
her
knee
and
began
to
sing
to
her
such
songs
as
made
her
wish
she
could
listen
to
them
for
ever
but
at
length
in
rushed
the
shining
fish
and
snuggled
down
in
the
pot
it
was
followed
by
a
youth
who
had
outgrown
his
worn
garments
his
face
was
ruddy
with
health
and
in
his
hand
he
carried
a
little
jewel
which
sparkled
in
the
firelight
the
first
words
the
lady
said
were
what
is
that
in
your
hand
mossy
now
mossy
was
the
name
his
companions
had
given
him
because
he
had
a
favourite
stone
covered
with
moss
on
which
he
used
to
sit
whole
days
reading
and
they
said
the
moss
had
begun
to
grow
upon
him
too
mossy
held
out
his
hand
the
moment
the
lady
saw
that
it
was
the
golden
key
she
rose
from
her
chair
kissed
mossy
on
the
forehead
made
him
sit
down
on
her
seat
and
stood
before
him
like
a
servant
mossy
could
not
bear
this
and
rose
at
once
but
the
lady
begged
him
with
tears
in
her
beautiful
eyes
to
sit
and
let
her
wait
on
him
but
you
are
a
great
splendid
beautiful
lady
said
mossy
yes
i
am
but
i
work
all
day
long
that
is
my
pleasure
and
you
will
have
to
leave
me
so
soon
how
do
you
know
that
if
you
please

mossy
because

got
the
golden
key
but
i
do
know
what
it
is
for

ca

for
the
that

your
work
i

not
help

i
can
only
tell
you
that
if
you
look
for
it
you
will
find
it
what
kind
of
box

what

there

i
do

of

supper
but
you

the
morning
all
i
can
do
for
you
is
to
give
you
clothes
here
is
a
girl
called
tangle
whom
you
must
take
with

nice
said
mossy
no

said
tangle
i
do
want
to
leave
you
please
grandmother
you
must
go
with
him
tangle
i
am
sorry
to
lose
you
but
it
will
be
the
best
thing
for
you
even
the
fishes
you
see
have
to
go
into
the
pot
and
then
out
into
the
dark
if
you
fall
in
with
the
old
man
of
the
sea
mind
you
ask
him
whether
he
has
not
got
some
more
fishes
ready
for
me
my
tank
is
getting
thin
so
saying
she
took
the
fish
from
the
pot
and
put
the
lid
on
as
before
they
sat
down
and
ate
the
fish
and
then
the
winged
creature
rose
from
the
pot
circled
the
roof
and
settled
on
the
lady
lap
she
talked
to
it
carried
it
to
the
door
and
threw
it
out
into
the
dark
they
heard
the
flap
of
its
wings
die
away
in
the
distance
the
lady
then
showed
mossy
into
just
such
another
chamber
as
that
of
tangle
and
in
the
morning
he
found
a
suit
of
clothes
laid
beside
him
he
looked
very
handsome
in
them
but
the
wearer
of
clothes
never
thinks
about
how
he
or
she
looks
but
thinks
always
how
handsome
other
people
are
tangle
was
very
unwilling
to
go
why
should
i
leave
you
i
do
know
the
young
man
she
said
to
the
lady
i
am
never
allowed
to
keep
my
children
long
you
need
not
go
with
him
except
you
please
but
you
must
go
some
day
and
i
should
like
you
to
go
with
him
for
he
has
the
golden
key
no
girl
need
be
afraid
to
go
with
a
youth
that
has
the
golden
key
you
will
take
care
of
her
mossy
will
you
not
that
i
will
said
mossy
and
tangle
cast
a
glance
at
him
and
thought
she
should
like
to
go
with
him
and
said
the
lady
if
you
should
lose
each
other
as
you
go
through
the
the
i
never
can
remember
the
name
of
that
country
do
not
be
afraid
but
go
on
and
on
she
kissed
tangle
on
the
mouth
and
mossy
on
the
forehead
led
them
to
the
door
and
waved
her
hand
eastward
mossy
and
tangle
took
each
other
hand
and
walked
away
into
the
depth
of
the
forest
in
his
right
hand
mossy
held
the
golden
key
they
wandered
thus
a
long
way
with
endless
amusement
from
the
talk
of
the
animals
they
soon
learned
enough
of
their
language
to
ask
them
necessary
questions
the
squirrels
were
always
friendly
and
gave
them
nuts
out
of
their
own
hoards
but
the
bees
were
selfish
and
rude
justifying
themselves
on
the
ground
that
tangle
and
mossy
were
not
subjects
of
their
queen
and
charity
must
begin
at
home
though
indeed
they
had
not
one
drone
in
their
poorhouse
at
the
time
even
the
blinking
moles
would
fetch
them
an
or
a
truffle
now
and
then
talking
as
if
their
mouths
as
well
as
their
eyes
and
ears
were
full
of
cotton
wool
or
their
own
velvety
fur
by
the
time
they
got
out
of
the
forest
they
were
very
fond
of
each
other
and
tangle
was
not
in
the
least
sorry
that
her
grandmother
had
sent
her
away
with
mossy
at
length
the
trees
grew
smaller
and
stood
farther
apart
and
the
ground
began
to
rise
and
it
got
more
and
more
steep
till
the
trees
were
all
left
behind
and
the
two
were
climbing
a
narrow
path
with
rocks
on
each
side
suddenly
they
came
upon
a
rude
doorway
by
which
they
entered
a
narrow
gallery
cut
in
the
rock
it
grew
darker
and
darker
till
it
was
and
they
had
to
feel
their
way
at
length
the
light
began
to
return
and
at
last
they
came
out
upon
a
narrow
path
on
the
face
of
a
lofty
precipice
this
path
went
winding
down
the
rock
to
a
wide
plain
circular
in
shape
and
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
mountains
those
opposite
to
them
were
a
great
way
off
and
towered
to
an
awful
height
shooting
up
sharp
blue
pinnacles
an
utter
silence
reigned
where
they
stood
not
even
the
sound
of
water
reached
them
looking
down
they
could
not
tell
whether
the
valley
below
was
a
grassy
plain
or
a
great
still
lake
they
had
never
seen
any
space
look
like
it
the
way
to
it
was
difficult
and
dangerous
but
down
the
narrow
path
they
went
and
reached
the
bottom
in
safety
they
found
it
composed
of
smooth
sandstone
undulating
in
parts
but
mostly
level
it
was
no
wonder
to
them
now
that
they
had
not
been
able
to
tell
what
it
was
for
this
surface
was
everywhere
crowded
with
shadows
the
mass
was
chiefly
made
up
of
the
shadows
of
leaves
innumerable
of
all
lovely
and
imaginative
forms
waving
to
and
fro
floating
and
quivering
in
the
breath
of
a
breeze
whose
motion
was
unfelt
whose
sound
was
unheard
no
forests
clothed
the
no
trees
were
anywhere
to
be
seen
and
yet
the
shadows
of
the
leaves
branches
and
stems
of
all
various
trees
covered
the
valley
as
far
as
their
eyes
could
reach
they
soon
spied
the
shadows
of
flowers
mingled
with
those
of
the
leaves
and
now
and
then
the
shadow
of
a
bird
with
open
beak
and
throat
distended
with
song
at
times
would
appear
the
forms
of
strange
graceful
creatures
running
up
and
down
the
and
along
the
branches
to
disappear
in
the
foliage
as
they
walked
they
waded
in
the
lovely
lake
for
the
shadows
were
not
merely
lying
on
the
surface
of
the
ground
but
heaped
up
above
it
like
substantial
forms
of
darkness
as
if
they
had
been
cast
upon
a
thousand
different
planes
of
the
air
tangle
and
mossy
often
lifted
their
heads
and
gazed
upwards
to
discry
whence
the
shadows
came
but
they
could
see
nothing
more
than
a
bright
mist
spread
above
them
higher
than
the
tops
of
the
mountains
which
stood
clear
against
it
no
forests
no
leaves
no
birds
were
visible
after
a
while
they
reached
more
open
spaces
where
the
shadows
were
thinner
and
came
even
to
portions
over
which
shadows
only
flitted
leaving
them
clear
for
such
as
might
follow
now
a
wonderful
form
half
half
human
would
float
across
on
outspread
sailing
pinions
anon
an
exquisite
shadow
group
of
gambolling
children
would
be
followed
by
the
loveliest
female
form
and
that
again
by
the
grand
stride
of
a
titanic
shape
each
disappearing
in
the
surrounding
press
of
shadowy
foliage
sometimes
a
profile
of
unspeakable
beauty
or
grandeur
would
appear
for
a
moment
and
vanish
sometimes
they
seemed
lovers
that
passed
linked
arm
in
arm
sometimes
father
and
son
sometimes
brothers
in
loving
contest
sometimes
sisters
entwined
in
gracefullest
community
of
complex
form
sometimes
wild
horses
would
tear
across
free
or
bestrode
by
noble
shadows
of
ruling
men
but
some
of
the
things
which
pleased
them
most
they
never
knew
how
to
describe
about
the
middle
of
the
plain
they
sat
down
to
rest
in
the
heart
of
a
heap
of
shadows
after
sitting
for
a
while
each
looking
up
saw
the
other
in
tears
they
were
each
longing
after
the
country
whence
the
shadows
fell
we
find
the
country
from
which
the
shadows
come
said
mossy
we
must
dear
mossy
responded
tangle
what
if
your
golden
key
should
be
the
key
to
ah
that
would
be
grand
returned
but
we
must
rest
here
for
a
little
and
then
we
shall
be
able
to
cross
the
plain
before
night
so
he
lay
down
on
the
ground
and
about
him
on
every
side
and
over
his
head
was
the
constant
play
of
the
wonderful
shadows
he
could
look
through
them
and
see
the
one
behind
the
other
till
they
mixed
in
a
mass
of
darkness
tangle
too
lay
admiring
and
wondering
and
longing
after
the
country
whence
the
shadows
came
when
they
were
rested
they
rose
and
pursued
their
journey
how
long
they
were
in
crossing
this
plain
i
can
not
tell
but
before
night
mossy
hair
was
streaked
with
gray
and
tangle
had
got
wrinkles
on
her
forehead
as
evening
grew
on
the
shadows
fell
deeper
and
rose
higher
at
length
they
reached
a
place
where
they
rose
above
their
heads
and
made
all
dark
around
them
then
they
took
hold
of
each
other
hand
and
walked
on
in
silence
and
in
some
dismay
they
felt
the
gathering
darkness
and
something
strangely
solemn
besides
and
the
beauty
of
the
shadows
ceased
to
delight
them
all
at
once
tangle
found
that
she
had
not
a
hold
of
mossy
hand
though
when
she
lost
it
she
could
not
tell
mossy
mossy
she
cried
aloud
in
terror
but
no
mossy
replied
a
moment
after
the
shadows
sank
to
her
feet
and
down
under
her
feet
and
the
mountains
rose
before
her
she
turned
towards
the
gloomy
region
she
had
left
and
called
once
more
upon
mossy
there
the
gloom
lay
tossing
and
heaving
a
dark
stormy
foamless
sea
of
shadows
but
no
mossy
rose
out
of
it
or
came
climbing
up
the
hill
on
which
she
stood
she
threw
herself
down
and
wept
in
despair
suddenly
she
remembered
that
the
beautiful
lady
had
told
them
if
they
lost
each
other
in
a
country
of
which
she
could
not
remember
the
name
they
were
not
to
be
afraid
but
to
go
straight
on
and
besides
she
said
to
herself
mossy
has
the
golden
key
and
so
no
harm
will
come
to
him
i
do
believe
she
rose
from
the
ground
and
went
on
before
long
she
arrived
at
a
precipice
in
the
face
of
which
a
stair
was
cut
when
she
had
ascended
the
stair
ceased
and
the
path
led
straight
into
the
mountain
she
was
afraid
to
enter
and
turning
again
towards
the
stair
grew
giddy
at
sight
of
the
depth
beneath
her
and
was
forced
to
throw
herself
down
in
the
mouth
of
the
cave
when
she
opened
her
eyes
she
saw
a
beautiful
little
figure
with
wings
standing
beside
her
waiting
i
know
you
said
tangle
you
are
my
fish
yes
but
i
am
a
fish
no
longer
i
am
an
now
what
is
that
asked
tangle
what
you
see
i
am
answered
the
shape
and
i
am
come
to
lead
you
through
the
mountain
oh
thank
you
dear
fish
i
mean
returned
tangle
rising
thereupon
the
took
to
his
wings
and
flew
on
through
the
long
narrow
passage
reminding
tangle
very
much
of
the
way
he
had
swum
on
before
her
when
he
was
a
fish
and
the
moment
his
white
wings
moved
they
began
to
throw
off
a
continuous
shower
of
sparks
of
all
colours
which
lighted
up
the
passage
before
all
at
once
he
vanished
and
tangle
heard
a
low
sweet
sound
quite
different
from
the
rush
and
crackle
of
his
wings
before
her
was
an
open
arch
and
through
it
came
light
mixed
with
the
sound
of
she
hurried
out
and
fell
tired
and
happy
upon
the
yellow
sand
of
the
shore
there
she
lay
half
asleep
with
weariness
and
rest
listening
to
the
low
plash
and
retreat
of
the
tiny
waves
which
seemed
ever
enticing
the
land
to
leave
off
being
land
and
become
sea
and
as
she
lay
her
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
foot
of
a
great
rainbow
standing
far
away
against
the
sky
on
the
other
side
of
the
sea
at
length
she
fell
fast
asleep
when
she
awoke
she
saw
an
old
man
with
long
white
hair
down
to
his
shoulders
leaning
upon
a
stick
covered
with
green
buds
and
so
bending
over
her
what
do
you
want
here
beautiful
woman
he
said
am
i
beautiful
i
am
so
glad
said
tangle
rising
my
grandmother
is
beautiful
yes
but
what
do
you
want
he
repeated
kindly
i
think
i
want
you
are
not
you
the
old
man
of
the
sea
i
am
then
grandmother
says
have
you
any
more
fishes
ready
for
her
we
will
go
and
see
my
dear
answered
the
old
man
speaking
yet
more
kindly
than
before
and
i
can
do
something
for
you
can
i
not
yes
show
me
the
way
up
to
the
country
from
which
the
shadows
fall
said
tangle
for
there
she
hoped
to
find
mossy
again
ah
indeed
that
would
be
worth
doing
said
the
old
man
but
i
can
not
for
i
do
not
know
the
way
myself
but
i
will
send
you
to
the
old
man
of
the
earth
perhaps
he
can
tell
you
he
is
much
older
than
i
am
leaning
on
his
staff
he
conducted
her
along
the
shore
to
a
steep
rock
that
looked
like
a
petrified
ship
turned
upside
down
the
door
of
it
was
the
rudder
of
a
great
vessel
ages
ago
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
immediately
within
the
door
was
a
stair
in
the
rock
down
which
the
old
man
went
and
tangle
followed
at
the
bottom
the
old
man
had
his
house
and
there
he
lived
as
soon
as
she
entered
it
tangle
heard
a
strange
noise
unlike
anything
she
had
ever
heard
before
she
soon
found
that
it
was
the
fishes
talking
she
tried
to
understand
what
they
said
but
their
speech
was
so
and
rude
and
undefined
that
she
could
not
make
much
of
it
i
will
go
and
see
about
those
fishes
for
my
daughter
said
the
old
man
of
the
sea
and
moving
a
slide
in
the
wall
of
his
house
he
first
looked
out
and
then
tapped
upon
a
thick
piece
of
crystal
that
filled
the
round
opening
tangle
came
up
behind
him
and
peeping
through
the
window
into
the
heart
of
the
great
deep
green
ocean
saw
the
most
curious
creatures
some
very
ugly
all
very
odd
and
with
especially
queer
mouths
swimming
about
everywhere
above
and
below
but
all
coming
towards
the
window
in
answer
to
the
tap
of
the
old
man
of
the
sea
only
a
few
could
get
their
mouths
against
the
glass
but
those
who
were
floating
miles
away
yet
turned
their
heads
towards
it
the
old
man
looked
through
the
whole
flock
carefully
for
some
minutes
and
then
turning
to
tangle
said
i
am
sorry
i
have
not
got
one
ready
yet
i
want
more
time
than
she
does
but
i
will
send
some
as
soon
as
i
can
he
then
shut
the
slide
presently
a
great
noise
arose
in
the
sea
the
old
man
opened
the
slide
again
and
tapped
on
the
glass
whereupon
the
fishes
were
all
as
still
as
sleep
they
were
only
talking
about
you
he
said
and
they
do
speak
such
nonsense
he
continued
i
must
show
you
the
way
to
the
old
man
of
the
earth
he
lives
a
long
way
from
here
do
let
me
go
at
once
said
tangle
no
that
is
not
possible
you
must
come
this
way
first
he
led
her
to
a
hole
in
the
wall
which
she
had
not
observed
before
it
was
covered
with
the
green
leaves
and
white
blossoms
of
a
creeping
plant
only
plants
can
grow
under
the
sea
said
the
old
man
in
there
you
will
find
a
bath
in
which
you
must
lie
till
i
call
you
tangle
went
in
and
found
a
smaller
room
or
cave
in
the
further
corner
of
which
was
a
great
basin
hollowed
out
of
a
rock
and
of
the
clearest
little
streams
were
constantly
running
into
it
from
cracks
in
the
wall
of
the
cavern
it
was
polished
quite
smooth
inside
and
had
a
carpet
of
yellow
sand
in
the
bottom
of
it
large
green
leaves
and
white
flowers
of
various
plants
crowded
up
and
over
it
draping
and
covering
it
almost
entirely
no
sooner
was
she
undressed
and
lying
in
the
bath
than
she
began
to
feel
as
if
the
water
were
sinking
into
her
and
she
were
receiving
all
the
good
of
sleep
without
undergoing
its
forgetfulness
she
felt
the
good
coming
all
the
time
and
she
grew
happier
and
more
hopeful
than
she
had
been
since
she
lost
mossy
but
she
could
not
help
thinking
how
very
sad
it
was
for
a
poor
old
man
to
live
there
all
alone
and
have
to
take
care
of
a
whole
seaful
of
stupid
and
riotous
fishes
after
about
an
hour
as
she
thought
she
heard
his
voice
calling
her
and
rose
out
of
the
bath
all
the
fatigue
and
aching
of
her
long
journey
had
vanished
she
was
as
whole
and
strong
and
well
as
if
she
had
slept
for
seven
days
returning
to
the
opening
that
led
into
the
other
part
of
the
house
she
started
back
with
amazement
for
through
it
she
saw
the
form
of
a
grand
man
with
a
majestic
and
beautiful
face
waiting
for
her
come
he
said
i
see
you
are
ready
she
entered
with
reverence
where
is
the
old
man
of
the
sea
she
asked
humbly
there
is
no
one
here
but
me
he
answered
smiling
some
people
call
me
the
old
man
of
the
sea
others
have
another
name
for
me
and
are
terribly
frightened
when
they
meet
me
taking
a
walk
by
the
shore
therefore
i
avoid
being
seen
by
them
for
they
are
so
afraid
that
they
never
see
what
i
really
am
you
see
me
but
i
must
show
you
the
way
to
the
old
man
of
the
earth
he
led
her
into
the
cave
where
the
bath
was
and
there
she
saw
in
the
opposite
corner
a
second
opening
in
the
rock
go
down
that
stair
and
it
will
bring
you
to
him
said
the
old
man
of
the
sea
with
humble
thanks
tangle
took
her
leave
she
went
down
the
winding
stair
till
she
began
to
fear
there
was
no
end
to
it
still
down
and
down
it
went
rough
and
broken
with
springs
of
water
bursting
out
of
the
rocks
and
running
down
the
steps
beside
her
it
was
quite
dark
about
her
and
yet
she
could
see
for
after
being
in
that
bath
people
eyes
always
give
out
a
light
they
can
see
by
there
were
no
creeping
things
in
the
way
all
was
safe
and
pleasant
though
so
dark
and
damp
and
deep
at
last
there
was
not
one
step
more
and
she
found
herself
in
a
glimmering
cave
on
a
stone
in
the
middle
of
it
sat
a
figure
with
its
back
towards
her
the
figure
of
an
old
man
bent
double
with
age
from
behind
she
could
see
his
white
beard
spread
out
on
the
rocky
floor
in
front
of
him
he
did
not
move
as
she
entered
so
she
passed
round
that
she
might
stand
before
him
and
speak
to
him
the
moment
she
looked
in
his
face
she
saw
that
he
was
a
youth
of
marvellous
beauty
he
sat
entranced
with
the
delight
of
what
he
beheld
in
a
mirror
of
something
like
silver
which
lay
on
the
floor
at
his
feet
and
which
from
behind
she
had
taken
for
his
white
beard
he
sat
on
heedless
of
her
presence
pale
with
the
joy
of
his
vision
she
stood
and
watched
him
at
length
all
trembling
she
spoke
but
her
voice
made
no
sound
yet
the
youth
lifted
up
his
head
he
showed
no
surprise
however
at
seeing
her
only
smiled
a
welcome
are
you
the
old
man
of
the
earth
tangle
had
said
and
the
youth
answered
and
tangle
heard
him
though
not
with
her
ears
i
am
what
can
i
do
for
you
tell
me
the
way
to
the
country
whence
the
shadows
fall
ah
that
i
do
not
know
i
only
dream
about
it
myself
i
see
its
shadows
sometimes
in
my
mirror
the
way
to
it
i
do
not
know
but
i
think
the
old
man
of
the
fire
must
know
he
is
much
older
than
i
am
he
is
the
oldest
man
of
all
where
does
he
live
i
will
show
you
the
way
to
his
place
i
never
saw
him
myself
so
saying
the
young
man
rose
and
then
stood
for
a
while
gazing
at
tangle
i
wish
i
could
see
that
country
too
he
said
but
i
must
mind
my
work
he
led
her
to
the
side
of
the
cave
and
told
her
to
lay
her
ear
against
the
wall
what
do
you
hear
he
asked
i
hear
answered
tangle
the
sound
of
a
great
water
running
inside
the
rock
that
river
runs
down
to
the
dwelling
of
the
oldest
man
of
all
the
old
man
of
the
fire
i
wish
i
could
go
to
see
him
but
i
must
mind
my
work
that
river
is
the
only
way
to
him
then
the
old
man
of
the
earth
stooped
over
the
floor
of
the
cave
raised
a
huge
stone
from
it
and
left
it
leaning
it
disclosed
a
great
hole
that
went
that
is
the
way
he
said
but
there
are
no
stairs
you
must
throw
yourself
in
there
is
no
other
way
she
turned
and
looked
him
full
in
the
face
stood
so
for
a
whole
minute
as
she
thought
it
was
a
whole
year
then
threw
herself
headlong
into
the
hole
when
she
came
to
herself
she
found
herself
gliding
down
fast
and
deep
her
head
was
under
water
but
that
did
not
signify
for
when
she
thought
about
it
she
could
not
remember
that
she
had
breathed
once
since
her
bath
in
the
cave
of
the
old
man
of
the
sea
when
she
lifted
up
her
head
a
sudden
and
fierce
heat
struck
her
and
she
sank
it
again
instantly
and
went
sweeping
on
gradually
the
stream
grew
shallower
at
length
she
could
hardly
keep
her
head
under
then
the
water
could
carry
her
no
farther
she
rose
from
the
channel
and
went
step
for
step
down
the
burning
descent
the
water
ceased
altogether
the
heat
was
terrible
she
felt
scorched
to
the
bone
but
it
did
not
touch
her
strength
it
grew
hotter
and
hotter
she
said
i
can
bear
it
no
longer
yet
she
went
on
at
the
long
last
the
stair
ended
at
a
rude
archway
in
an
all
but
glowing
rock
through
this
archway
tangle
fell
exhausted
into
a
cool
mossy
cave
the
floor
and
walls
were
covered
with
moss
green
soft
and
damp
a
little
stream
spouted
from
a
rent
in
the
rock
and
fell
into
a
basin
of
moss
she
plunged
her
face
into
it
and
drank
then
she
lifted
her
head
and
looked
around
then
she
rose
and
looked
again
she
saw
no
one
in
the
cave
but
the
moment
she
stood
upright
she
had
a
marvellous
sense
that
she
was
in
the
secret
of
the
earth
and
all
its
ways
everything
she
had
seen
or
learned
from
books
all
that
her
grandmother
had
said
or
sung
to
her
all
the
talk
of
the
beasts
birds
and
fishes
all
that
had
happened
to
her
on
her
journey
with
mossy
and
since
then
in
the
heart
of
the
earth
with
the
old
man
and
the
older
man
all
was
plain
she
understood
it
all
and
saw
that
everything
meant
the
same
thing
though
she
could
not
have
put
it
into
words
again
the
next
moment
she
descried
in
a
corner
of
the
cave
a
little
naked
child
sitting
on
the
moss
he
was
playing
with
balls
of
various
colours
and
sizes
which
he
disposed
in
strange
figures
upon
the
floor
beside
him
and
now
tangle
felt
that
there
was
something
in
her
knowledge
which
was
not
in
her
understanding
for
she
knew
there
must
be
an
infinite
meaning
in
the
change
and
sequence
and
individual
forms
of
the
figures
into
which
the
child
arranged
the
balls
as
well
as
in
the
varied
harmonies
of
their
colours
but
what
it
all
meant
she
could
not
tell
he
went
on
busily
tirelessly
playing
his
solitary
game
without
looking
up
or
seeming
to
know
that
there
was
a
stranger
in
his
cell
diligently
as
a
shifts
her
bobbins
he
shifted
and
arranged
his
balls
flashes
of
meaning
would
now
pass
from
them
to
tangle
and
now
again
all
would
be
not
merely
obscure
but
utterly
dark
she
stood
looking
for
a
long
time
for
there
was
fascination
in
the
sight
and
the
longer
she
looked
the
more
an
indescribable
vague
intelligence
went
on
rousing
itself
in
her
mind
for
seven
years
she
had
stood
there
watching
the
naked
child
with
his
coloured
balls
and
it
seemed
to
her
like
seven
hours
when
all
at
once
the
shape
the
balls
took
she
knew
not
why
reminded
her
of
the
valley
of
shadows
and
she
spoke
where
is
the
old
man
of
the
fire
she
said
i
think
i
must
be
indebted
to
novalis
for
these
geometrical
figures
here
i
am
answered
the
child
rising
and
leaving
his
balls
on
the
moss
what
can
i
do
for
you
there
was
such
an
awfulness
of
absolute
repose
on
the
face
of
the
child
that
tangle
stood
dumb
before
him
he
had
no
smile
but
the
love
in
his
large
gray
eyes
was
deep
as
the
centre
and
with
the
repose
there
lay
on
his
face
a
shimmer
as
of
moonlight
which
seemed
as
if
any
moment
it
might
break
into
such
a
ravishing
smile
as
would
cause
the
beholder
to
weep
himself
to
death
but
the
smile
never
came
and
the
moonlight
lay
there
unbroken
for
the
heart
of
the
child
was
too
deep
for
any
smile
to
reach
from
it
to
his
face
are
you
the
oldest
man
of
all
tangle
at
length
although
filled
with
awe
ventured
to
ask
yes
i
am
i
am
very
very
old
i
am
able
to
help
you
i
know
i
can
help
everybody
and
the
child
drew
near
and
looked
up
in
her
face
so
that
she
burst
into
tears
can
you
tell
me
the
way
to
the
country
the
shadows
fall
from
she
sobbed
yes
i
know
the
way
quite
well
i
go
there
myself
sometimes
but
you
could
not
go
my
way
you
are
not
old
enough
i
will
show
you
how
you
can
go
do
not
send
me
out
into
the
great
heat
again
prayed
tangle
i
will
not
answered
the
child
and
he
reached
up
and
put
his
little
cool
hand
on
her
heart
now
he
said
you
can
go
the
fire
will
not
burn
you
come
he
led
her
from
the
cave
and
following
him
through
another
archway
she
found
herself
in
a
vast
desert
of
sand
and
rock
the
sky
of
it
was
of
rock
lowering
over
them
like
solid
thunderclouds
and
the
whole
place
was
so
hot
that
she
saw
in
bright
rivulets
the
yellow
gold
and
white
silver
and
red
copper
trickling
molten
from
the
rocks
but
the
heat
never
came
near
her
when
they
had
gone
some
distance
the
child
turned
up
a
great
stone
and
took
something
like
an
egg
from
under
it
he
next
drew
a
long
curved
line
in
the
sand
with
his
finger
and
laid
the
egg
in
it
he
then
spoke
something
tangle
could
not
understand
the
egg
broke
a
small
snake
came
out
and
lying
in
the
line
in
the
sand
grew
and
grew
till
he
filled
it
the
moment
he
was
thus
he
began
to
glide
away
undulating
like
a
follow
that
serpent
said
the
child
he
will
lead
you
the
right
way
tangle
followed
the
serpent
but
she
could
not
go
far
without
looking
back
at
the
marvellous
child
he
stood
alone
in
the
midst
of
the
glowing
desert
beside
a
fountain
of
red
flame
that
had
burst
forth
at
his
feet
his
naked
whiteness
glimmering
a
pale
rosy
red
in
the
torrid
fire
there
he
stood
looking
after
her
till
from
the
lengthening
distance
she
could
see
him
no
more
the
serpent
went
straight
on
turning
neither
to
the
right
nor
left
meantime
mossy
had
got
out
of
the
lake
of
shadows
and
following
his
mournful
lonely
way
had
reached
the
it
was
a
dark
stormy
evening
the
sun
had
set
the
wind
was
blowing
from
the
sea
the
waves
had
surrounded
the
rock
within
which
lay
the
old
man
house
a
deep
water
rolled
between
it
and
the
shore
upon
which
a
majestic
figure
was
walking
alone
mossy
went
up
to
him
and
said
will
you
tell
me
where
to
find
the
old
man
of
the
sea
i
am
the
old
man
of
the
sea
the
figure
answered
i
see
a
strong
kingly
man
of
middle
age
returned
mossy
then
the
old
man
looked
at
him
more
intently
and
said
your
sight
young
man
is
better
than
that
of
most
who
take
this
way
the
night
is
stormy
come
to
my
house
and
tell
me
what
i
can
do
for
you
mossy
followed
him
the
waves
flew
from
before
the
footsteps
of
the
old
man
of
the
sea
and
mossy
followed
upon
dry
sand
when
they
had
reached
the
cave
they
sat
down
and
gazed
at
each
other
now
mossy
was
an
old
man
by
this
time
he
looked
much
older
than
the
old
man
of
the
sea
and
his
feet
were
very
weary
after
looking
at
him
for
a
moment
the
old
man
took
him
by
the
hand
and
led
him
into
his
inner
cave
there
he
helped
him
to
undress
and
laid
him
in
the
bath
and
he
saw
that
one
of
his
hands
mossy
did
not
open
what
have
you
in
that
hand
he
asked
mossy
opened
his
hand
and
there
lay
the
golden
key
ah
said
the
old
man
that
accounts
for
your
knowing
me
and
i
know
the
way
you
have
to
go
i
want
to
find
the
country
whence
the
shadows
fall
said
mossy
i
dare
say
you
do
so
do
i
but
meantime
one
thing
is
what
is
that
key
for
do
you
think
for
a
somewhere
but
i
do
know
why
i
keep
it
i
never
could
find
the
and
i
have
lived
a
good
while
i
believe
said
mossy
sadly
i
not
sure
that
i
not
old
i
know
my
feet
ache
do
they
said
the
old
man
as
if
he
really
meant
to
ask
the
question
and
mossy
who
was
still
lying
in
the
bath
watched
his
feet
for
a
moment
before
he
replied
no
they
do
not
perhaps
i
am
not
old
either
get
up
and
look
at
yourself
in
the
water
he
rose
and
looked
at
himself
in
the
water
and
there
was
not
a
gray
hair
on
his
head
or
a
wrinkle
on
his
skin
you
have
tasted
of
death
now
said
the
old
man
is
it
good
it
is
good
said
mossy
it
is
better
than
life
no
said
the
old
man
it
is
only
more
your
feet
will
make
no
holes
in
the
water
now
what
do
you
mean
i
will
show
you
that
presently
they
returned
to
the
outer
cave
and
sat
and
talked
together
for
a
long
time
at
length
the
old
man
of
the
sea
rose
and
said
to
mossy
follow
me
he
led
him
up
the
stair
again
and
opened
another
door
they
stood
on
the
level
of
the
raging
sea
looking
towards
the
east
across
the
waste
of
waters
against
the
bosom
of
a
fierce
black
cloud
stood
the
foot
of
a
rainbow
glowing
in
the
dark
this
indeed
is
my
way
said
mossy
as
soon
as
he
saw
the
rainbow
and
stepped
out
upon
the
sea
his
feet
made
no
holes
in
the
water
he
fought
the
wind
and
clomb
the
waves
and
went
on
towards
the
rainbow
the
storm
died
away
a
lovely
day
and
a
lovelier
night
followed
a
cool
wind
blew
over
the
wide
plain
of
the
quiet
ocean
and
still
mossy
journeyed
eastward
but
the
rainbow
had
vanished
with
the
storm
day
after
day
he
held
on
and
he
thought
he
had
no
guide
he
did
not
see
how
a
shining
fish
under
the
water
directed
his
steps
he
crossed
the
sea
and
came
to
a
great
precipice
of
rock
up
which
he
could
discover
but
one
path
nor
did
this
lead
him
farther
than
up
the
rock
where
it
ended
on
a
platform
here
he
stood
and
it
could
not
be
that
the
way
stopped
here
else
what
was
the
path
for
it
was
a
rough
path
not
very
plain
yet
certainly
a
he
examined
the
face
of
the
rock
it
was
smooth
as
glass
but
as
his
eyes
kept
roving
hopelessly
over
it
something
glittered
and
he
caught
sight
of
a
row
of
small
sapphires
they
bordered
a
little
hole
in
the
rock
the
he
cried
he
tried
the
key
it
fitted
it
turned
a
great
clang
and
clash
as
of
iron
bolts
on
huge
brazen
caldrons
echoed
thunderously
within
he
drew
out
the
key
the
rock
in
front
of
him
began
to
fall
he
retreated
from
it
as
far
as
the
breadth
of
the
platform
would
allow
a
great
slab
fell
at
his
feet
in
front
was
still
the
solid
rock
with
this
one
slab
fallen
forward
out
of
it
but
the
moment
he
stepped
upon
it
a
second
fell
just
short
of
the
edge
of
the
first
making
the
next
step
of
a
stair
which
thus
kept
dropping
itself
before
him
as
he
ascended
into
the
heart
of
the
precipice
it
led
him
into
a
hall
fit
for
such
an
approach
irregular
and
rude
in
formation
but
floor
sides
pillars
and
vaulted
roof
all
one
mass
of
shining
stones
of
every
colour
that
light
can
show
in
the
centre
stood
seven
columns
ranged
from
red
to
violet
and
on
the
pedestal
of
one
of
them
sat
a
woman
motionless
with
her
face
bowed
upon
her
knees
seven
years
had
she
sat
there
waiting
she
lifted
her
head
as
mossy
drew
near
it
was
tangle
her
hair
had
grown
to
her
feet
and
was
rippled
like
the
windless
sea
on
broad
sands
her
face
was
beautiful
like
her
grandmother
and
as
still
and
peaceful
as
that
of
the
old
man
of
the
fire
her
form
was
tall
and
noble
yet
mossy
knew
her
at
once
how
beautiful
you
are
tangle
he
said
in
delight
and
astonishment
am
i
she
returned
oh
i
have
waited
for
you
so
long
but
you
you
are
like
the
old
man
of
the
sea
no
you
are
like
the
old
man
of
the
earth
no
no
you
are
like
the
oldest
man
of
all
you
are
like
them
all
and
yet
you
are
my
own
old
mossy
how
did
you
come
here
what
did
you
do
after
i
lost
you
did
you
find
the
have
you
got
the
key
still
she
had
a
hundred
questions
to
ask
him
and
he
a
hundred
more
to
ask
her
they
told
each
other
all
their
adventures
and
were
as
happy
as
man
and
woman
could
be
for
they
were
younger
and
better
and
stronger
and
wiser
than
they
had
ever
been
before
it
began
to
grow
dark
and
they
wanted
more
than
ever
to
reach
the
country
whence
the
shadows
fall
so
they
looked
about
them
for
a
way
out
of
the
cave
the
door
by
which
mossy
entered
had
closed
again
and
there
was
half
a
mile
of
rock
between
them
and
the
sea
neither
could
tangle
find
the
opening
in
the
floor
by
which
the
serpent
had
led
her
thither
they
searched
till
it
grew
so
dark
that
they
could
see
nothing
and
gave
it
up
after
a
while
however
the
cave
began
to
glimmer
again
the
light
came
from
the
moon
but
it
did
not
look
like
moonlight
for
it
gleamed
through
those
seven
pillars
in
the
middle
and
filled
the
place
with
all
colours
and
now
mossy
saw
that
there
was
a
pillar
beside
the
red
one
which
he
had
not
observed
before
and
it
was
of
the
same
new
colour
that
he
had
seen
in
the
rainbow
when
he
saw
it
first
in
the
fairy
forest
and
on
it
he
saw
a
sparkle
of
blue
it
was
the
sapphires
round
the
he
took
his
key
it
turned
in
the
lock
to
the
sound
of
aeolian
music
a
door
opened
upon
slow
hinges
and
disclosed
a
winding
stair
within
the
key
vanished
from
his
fingers
tangle
went
up
mossy
followed
the
door
closed
behind
them
they
climbed
out
of
the
earth
and
still
climbing
rose
above
it
they
were
in
the
rainbow
far
abroad
over
ocean
and
land
they
could
see
through
its
transparent
walls
the
earth
beneath
their
feet
stairs
beside
stairs
wound
up
together
and
beautiful
beings
of
all
ages
climbed
along
with
them
they
knew
that
they
were
going
up
to
the
country
whence
the
shadows
fall
and
by
this
time
i
think
they
must
have
got
there
