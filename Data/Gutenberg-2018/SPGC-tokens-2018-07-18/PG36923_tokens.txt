note
last
spring
i
visited
the
pawnee
agency
in
the
indian
territory
on
the
day
after
my
arrival
i
rode
over
to
the
house
of
eagle
chief
whom
under
his
warrior
name
white
eagle
i
had
known
for
many
years
entering
the
door
i
found
myself
in
the
presence
of
the
chief
who
after
quickly
putting
his
hand
over
his
mouth
in
his
astonishment
greeted
me
with
a
cordial
then
we
sat
down
and
filled
the
pipe
and
talked
through
all
our
talk
i
could
see
that
he
was
curious
to
know
the
object
of
my
visit
at
last
he
said
my
son
i
am
glad
that
you
have
come
to
us
once
more
my
mind
is
big
when
i
look
at
you
and
talk
to
you
it
is
good
that
you
are
here
why
have
you
come
again
to
the
pawnee
village
what
brings
you
here
at
this
time
i
answered
father
we
have
come
down
here
to
visit
the
people
and
to
talk
to
them
to
ask
them
about
how
things
used
to
be
in
the
olden
times
to
hear
their
stories
to
get
their
history
and
then
to
put
all
these
things
down
in
a
book
so
that
in
the
years
to
come
after
the
tribe
have
all
become
like
white
people
the
old
things
of
the
pawnees
shall
not
be
forgotten
the
chief
meditated
for
a
while
and
then
said
it
is
good
and
it
is
time
already
the
old
things
are
being
lost
and
those
who
knew
the
secrets
are
many
of
them
dead
if
we
had
known
how
to
write
we
would
have
put
all
these
things
down
and
they
would
not
have
been
forgotten
but
we
could
not
write
and
these
stories
were
handed
down
from
one
to
another
the
old
men
told
their
grandchildren
and
they
told
their
grandchildren
and
so
the
secrets
and
the
stories
and
the
doings
of
long
ago
have
been
handed
down
it
may
be
that
they
have
changed
as
they
passed
from
father
to
son
and
it
is
well
that
they
should
be
put
down
so
that
our
children
when
they
are
like
the
white
people
can
know

were

the
pawnees
and
their
stories
once
the
pawnees
were
a
great
people
they
were
very
numerous
they
were
undisputed
masters
of
a
vast
territory
they
had
everything
that
heart
could
wish
their
corn
and
their
buffalo
gave
them
food
clothing
and
shelter
they
had
weapons
for
war
and
for
the
chase
they
roamed
over
the
country
without
let
or
hindrance
in
peace
they
were
and
contented
in
war
cunning
fierce
and
successful
their
name
was
a
terror
to
their
enemies
this
was
in
the
past
now
they
are
few
in
number
poor
a
prey
to
disease
a
vanishing
race
my
acquaintance
with
the
tribe
began
in
from
that
time
to
the
present
i
have
had
frequent
intercourse
with
them
have
lived
in
their
villages
and
been
with
them
on
their
buffalo
hunts
during
the
weeks
and
months
spent
in
camp
and
village
i
have
listened
to
many
stories
of
pawnee
heroes
and
to
of
the
miraculous
doings
of
the
olden
time
in
my
intercourse
with
the
tribe
extending
over
a
period
of
nearly
twenty
years
i
have
been
deeply
impressed
by
the
high
qualities
of
the
pawnee
character
and
the
more
familiar
i
have
become
with
this
people
the
more
strongly
have
i
felt
that
a
permanent
record
should
be
made
of
the
tales
which
reflect
that
character
unless
thus
collected
now
much
of
this
lore
must
inevitably
be
forgotten
for
the
pawnees
are
passing
away
when
i
first
joined
them
on
their
buffalo
hunts
from
their
old
home
on
the
loup
fork
in
nebraska
the
tribe
numbered
three
thousand
last
march
in
the
indian
territory
i
found
but
eight
hundred
and
more
rapidly
than
the
dwindling
of
the
people
are
their
traditions
lapsing
from
memory
under
the
changed
conditions
of
the
tribe
life
the
lore
which
sprang
up
as
an
indigenous
growth
of
the
prairie
and
the
wilderness
where
the
wild
pawnee
warrior
hunted
free
finds
scanty
nurture
in
the
uncongenial
soil
of
fields
tilled
by
pawnee
followers
of
the
plow
with
the
new
modes
of
living
come
new
views
of
life
new
motives
new
sympathies
in
a
word
civilization
to
earn
a
living
by
toil
to
wrest
subsistence
from
the
earth
this
is
the
problem
confronting
the
pawnees
the
task
which
is
engaging
the
sinew
and
purpose
of
the
tribe
in
the
transition
stage
the
memory
of
the
old
days
of
old
manners
and
rites
and
ceremonies
and
of
old
heroes
is
with
the
elders
of
the
race
those
ancient
braves
whose
lives
bridge
the
past
and
the
present
when
i
visited
the
agency
last
march
it
was
to
write
down
from
the
lips
of
these
old
men
such
material
as
i
could
collect
when
they
shall
die
much
of
the
unwritten
lore
will
perish
too
for
with
them
will
cease
that
sympathetic
and
perfect
credence
which
alone
gives
to
vitality
and
lastingness
what
is
written
in
this
volume
then
belongs
distinctly
to
the
wild
indian
the
task
that
i
have
set
for
myself
is
that
of
a
recorder
no
attempt
has
been
made
to
give
a
literary
color
to
the
hero
stories
and
here
written
out
i
have
scrupulously
avoided
putting
into
them
anything
of
my
own
the
stories
are
told
to
the
reader
as
they
were
told
to
me
they
are
not
elaborated
i
have
tried
to
show
how
indians
think
and
speak
rather
than
to
make
their
stories
more
entertaining
by
dressing
them
up
to
suit
the
civilized
taste
my
object
in
giving
these
narratives
in
their
present
shape
is
to
make
a
book
which
shall
be
true
to
life
and
shall
faithfully
reflect
the
pawnee
character
as
the
story
tellers
have
themselves
painted
it
in
a
very
few
cases
i
have
added
some
words
explaining
matters
so
well
understood
by
those
familiar
with
the
indians
as
to
need
no
explanation
if
these
tales
have
any
ethnological
value
it
will
be
enhanced
by
their
being
given
in
the
precise
form
in
which
they
were
told
by
those
to
whom
they
have
been
handed
down
from
generation
to
generation
but
quite
apart
from
this
is
another
point
which
is
entitled
to
consideration
the
entire
ignorance
concerning
indians
which
prevails
among
the
general
public
can
be
dispelled
only
by
letting
that
public
understand
something
of
the
ways
of
life
of
the
wild
indian
something
of
the
subjects
about
which
he
thinks
and
talks
as
well
as
of
how
he
looks
at
these
subjects
and
what
he
has
to
say
about
them
the
late
jackson
charming
story
ramona
did
much
to
bring
the
more
intelligent
class
of
readers
in
touch
with
the
indians
and
to
awaken
sympathy
for
them
by
pointing
out
the
unnumbered
wrongs
perpetrated
on
this
race
by
the
government
jackson
book
was
a
story
a
novel
wonderfully
well
told
and
full
of
truth
and
feeling
but
while
it
may
have
been
a
relation
of
facts
it
did
not
profess
to
treat
of
actual
persons
it
is
looked
upon
by
many
readers
as
a
mere
romance
it
is
a
book
about
which
i
was
once
asked
skeptically
did
you
ever
see
any
indians
like
those
in
the
pawnee
stories
here
set
down
there
is
no
romance
nor
coloring
the
indians
themselves
are
talking
and
whatever
the
faults
and
weak
points
of
these
tales
and
some
of
them
are
sufficiently
obvious
they
at
least
give
the
reader
a
true
conception
of
indians
as
they
have
actually
lived
they
are
stories
of
indians
by
indians
there
is
about
them
nothing
of
the
white
man
and
the
intelligent
person
who
is
sufficiently
interested
in
the
subject
to
read
this
book
through
will
gain
from
it
a
new
insight
into
indian
character
the
indian
of
cooper
with
his
bravery
his
endurance
his
acuteness
his
high
qualities
of
honesty
generosity
courtesy
and
hospitality
has
been
laughed
at
for
half
a
century
yet
every
man
who
has
mingled
much
with
the
indians
in
their
homes
has
known
individuals
who
might
have
sat
for
the
portraits
which
cooper
drew
of
some
of
his
aboriginal
heroes
there
are
good
men
among
indians
just
as
among
the
whites
the
prevalent
notion
of
the
indian
has
been
formed
from
the
worst
class
of
this
people
the
lazy
filthy
beggars
who
haunt
the
settlements
of
the
west
who
to
their
own
vices
have
added
new
ones
picked
up
from
their
surroundings
and
who
are
hopelessly
degraded
these
are
not
typical
indians
and
it
is
unjust
to
judge
a
whole
race
from
such
degenerate
specimens
there
is
still
another
notion
of
the
indian
fondly
cherished
by
many
worthy
people
whose
sympathies
have
been
wrought
upon
by
the
cruelty
and
injustice
with
which
we
have
treated
this
race
these
good
people
look
upon
all
indians
as
simple
children
of
nature
who
would
do
no
wrong
if
they
had
not
been
contaminated
by
contact
with
vicious
whites
it
is
unnecessary
to
say
that
this
notion
of
the
indian
is
also
incorrect
the
indian
is
neither
a
fiend
nor
a
saint
there
are
good
ones
and
bad
ones
as
a
rule
perhaps
they
try
to
act
up
to
their
ideas
of
what
is
right
but
the
standard
of
a
race
of
barbarians
can
not
be
the
same
as
that
of
a
civilized
people
and
in
judging
of
their
character
we
must
make
allowances
for
this
difference
the
standard
of
right
and
wrong
among
civilized
people
is
a
growth
the
product
of
the
experience
of
thousands
of
years
the
indian
races
have
not
been
through
a
like
experience
they
have
regarded
as
virtues
some
things
which
seem
to
us
the
worst
of
crimes
the
indian
differs
from
the
white
man
in
education
and
manner
of
life
and
so
of
course
in
his
modes
of
thought
he
has
not
been
taught
the
lesson
of
which
his
surroundings
oblige
each
civilized
man
to
begin
to
learn
as
a
child
he
has
known
until
recent
times
no
law
save
that
of
strength
he
has
been
taught
that
war
is
the
noblest
of
pursuits
the
only
one
worthy
of
man
and
that
war
has
consisted
in
making
forays
upon
his
enemies
taking
their
possessions
and
if
possible
their
lives
and
their
scalps
his
warfare
consisted
in
surprises
rather
than
open
combat
a
scalp
taken
was
a
trophy
of
victory
and
the
scalp
of
a
woman
was
almost
as
eagerly
sought
as
that
of
a
brave
or
of
a
chief
it
was
an
evidence
of
injury
inflicted
on
the
enemy
to
steal
horses
from
the
enemy
was
an
achievement
creditable
and
also
profitable
we
commonly
speak
of
the
raids
of
war
parties
as
horse
stealing
expeditions
but
this
is
wholly
misleading
because
to
the
civilized
understanding
the
phrase
horse
stealing
carries
with
it
an
idea
of
dishonesty
no
such
meaning
attaches
to
the
indian
equivalent
of
this
phrase
they
take
horses
by
stratagem
or
secretly
by
the
usual
and
to
them
legitimate
methods
of
warfare
to
speak
of
their
stealing
horses
using
that
verb
in
the
sense
which
we
commonly
give
it
would
be
like
saying
that
an
army
stole
the
cannon
which
it
captured
in
an
engagement
with
the
enemy
captured
horses
were
the
legitimate
spoils
of
war
the
wealth
of
the
indians
was
in
their
horses
they
had
no
fortified
places
no
ships
of
war
no
cannon
no
works
of
art
their
only
valuable
possessions
were
their
horses
these
were
the
only
property
that
could
be
carried
off
therefore
when
an
expedition
was
made
against
a
hostile
tribe
scalps
and
horses
were
naturally
its
object
horses
being
their
only
valuable
possessions
constituted
their
medium
of
exchange
so
far
as
they
had
any
did
a
man
wish
to
purchase
an
ornament
or
an
article
of
dress
which
took
his
fancy
he
gave
a
horse
for
it
if
he
bought
a
wife
he
paid
for
her
in
horses
the
most
valuable
present
that
could
be
made
was
a
good
horse
and
horses
were
often
given
by
the
to
their
friends
and
relations
who
had
been
sick
or
unfortunate
on
the
other
hand
when
as
was
sometimes
the
case
a
conquered
tribe
was
condemned
to
pay
a
war
indemnity
they
paid
it
in
horses
it
is
related
that
when
the
skidi
broke
their
treaty
with
the
other
bands
and
were
afterward
conquered
by
them
they
were
obliged
to
pay
such
a
fine
this
view
of
indian
warfare
being
understood
the
motive
of
the
hero
stories
here
given
and
of
many
of
the
becomes
plain
the
pawnees
are
essentially
a
religious
people
they
worship
who
is
in
and
of
everything
unlike
many
of
the
indian
tribes
of
the
west
they
do
not
adore
any
material
thing
they
regard
certain
places
as
sacred
but
these
are
so
only
because
blessed
by
the
divine
presence
the
pawnee
deity
is
not
personified
he
is
intangible
quite
as
much
so
as
the
god
of
the
christians
the
sacred
character
of
extends
to
animal
nature
the
fishes
which
swim
in
the
rivers
the
birds
of
the
air
and
the
beasts
which
roam
over
the
prairie
have
sometimes
intelligence
knowledge
and
power
far
beyond
those
of
man
but
they
are
not
gods
their
miraculous
attributes
are
given
them
by
the
ruler
whose
servants
they
are
and
who
often
makes
them
the
medium
of
his
communications
to
man
they
are
his
messengers
his
angels
and
their
powers
are
always
used
for
good
prayers
are
made
to
them
sometimes
for
direct
help
in
time
of
need
but
more
often
for
intercession
often
in
the
it
will
be
seen
that
when
the
blessing
asked
for
is
some
small
thing
a
prayer
is
made
to
the
animals
but
if
the
petitioners
are
asking
for
some
great
thing
something
which
is
very
difficult
to
grant
then
the
prayer
is
made
to
one
above
to
the
ruler
that
is
to
the
supreme
being
nothing
of
importance
was
ever
undertaken
without
a
prayer
for
help
for
success
all
the
serious
undertakings
of
the
year
whose
success
would
affect
the
general
welfare
were
preceded
by
religious
ceremonies
when
all
the
tribe
took
part
and
prayers
were
made
and
sacrifices
offered
to
and
in
all
lesser
enterprises
the
individuals
who
were
interested
humbled
themselves
and
implored
the
divine
assistance
a
party
starting
off
on
the
warpath
prayed
for
success
and
made
a
burnt
offering
prayer
and
sacrifice
always
marked
the
beginning
of
the
feast
and
often
its
end
success
in
their
undertakings
was
acknowledged
by
grateful
offerings
to
the
ruler
the
victorious
warrior
sometimes
sacrificed
the
scalp
torn
from
the
head
of
his
enemy
and
this
was
burned
with
elaborate
ceremonies
by
the
high
priest
he
who
brought
back
from
a
foray
many
horses
gave
one
to
the
priest
as
a
to
the
ruler
one
of
the
seven
brothers
said
to
me
it
is
our
aim
after
we
have
been
helped
to
give
thanks
the
feeling
of
these
indians
toward
their
god
is
one
of
humility
and
reverence
they
do
not
love
him
but
they
look
to
him
for
help
at
all
times
the
young
are
exhorted
to
humble
themselves
before
him
to
pray
to
him
to
look
to
one
above
to
ask
help
from
the
ruler
in
the
stories
which
are
included
in
this
book
the
allusions
constantly
made
to
the
supreme
power
the
prayers
offered
and
the
humility
and
so
often
expressed
show
faith
profound
religious
feelings
and
great
elevation
of
thought
among
tribal
names
of
north
american
indians
none
is
more
familiar
to
us
than
pawnee
yet
of
no
tribe
is
less
known
frequent
allusions
to
them
occur
in
the
writings
of
early
travelers
in
the
west
but
only
one
satisfactory
attempt
has
been
made
to
write
a
connected
history
of
this
family
in
the
of
american
for
john
dunbar
published
a
most
interesting
account
of
this
tribe
but
his
sketch
is
mainly
historical
and
does
not
profess
to
treat
exhaustively
of
the
lives
and
modes
of
thought
of
this
people
it
is
however
a
history
of
very
great
importance
and
value
and
in
preparing
the
historical
matter
which
is
included
in
this
volume
i
have
not
hesitated
to
draw
on
dunbar
papers
which
must
form
the
basis
of
any
subsequent
account
of
the
pawnees
and
which
should
be
read
by
all
who
are
interested
in
this
people
i
owe
much
of
my
interest
in
and
knowledge
of
the
pawnees
to
my
long
intimacy
with
the
late
major
frank
north
who
from
his
extended
intercourse
and
close
connection
with
this
people
a
connection
which
lasted
more
than
thirty
years
was
unquestionably
better
informed
about
them
than
any
other
white
man
has
ever
been
and
with
capt
north
his
brother
who
was
for
many
years
associated
with
major
north
in
command
of
the
pawnee
scouts
in
gathering
the
material
here
presented
i
have
been
assisted
also
by

murie

nephew
of

and
frank
white
and
by
many
others
of
my
pawnee
friends
to
all
of
whom
my
acknowledgments
are
due
in
the
pronunciation
of
the
few
pawnee
words
used
in
these
stories
the
vowel
sounds
as
nearly
as
i
can
give
them
are
as
follows
as
in
father
as
the
in
ale
as
in
cede
long
as
in
pool
short
as
in
us
as
in
house
these
sounds
depend
somewhat
on
the
letters
which
follow
the
vowels
and
the
spelling
does
not
always
conform
to
the
rule
laid
down
the
last
two
syllables
in
the
word
for
example
are
pronounced
or
the
sounds
of
and
are
difficult
to
express
by
english
letters
sometimes
has
its
own
sound
quite
distinctly
at
others
more
the
sound
of
often
has
a
sound
and
a
sound
of
it
will
be
noted
that
throughout
this
volume
i
have
used
the
familiar
english
word
pawnee
instead
of
the
evidently
more
correct
finally
i
have
refrained
from
commenting
on
the
stories
though
there
is
abundant
opportunity
for
comment
july
comanche
chief
the
i
many
years
ago
there
lived
in
the
village
a
young
man
about
sixteen
years
old
his
name
was
the
hawk
at
this
time
the
pawnees
wore
their
hair
in
the
ancient
fashion
cut
as
the
osages
wear
theirs
the
whole
head
was
shaved
except
a
roach
running
back
from
the
forehead
beyond
the
scalp
lock
a
war
party
went
off
to
the
south
and
he
joined
them
as
a
servant
they
went
a
long
way
and
a
long
way
traveling
far
but
they
got
no
horses
and
came
back
afterward
another
party
started
off
on
the
warpath
and
he
went
with
it
they
traveled
many
days
going
to
the
southwest
and
at
length
they
came
to
a
camp
and
hid
themselves
to
wait
until
it
was
dark
it
was
a
camp
of
the
comanches
when
night
had
come
they
all
went
into
the
camp
to
steal
horses
this
young
man
went
to
a
lodge
near
which
stood
three
horses
two
spotted
horses
and
one
gray
they
were
tied
near
the
door
of
the
lodge
and
from
this
he
thought
they
must
be
fast
for
the
indians
usually
tie
up
their
best
horses
close
to
the
lodge
door
where
they
will
be
under
their
eyes
as
much
as
possible
he
went
to
the
lodge
to
cut
the
ropes
and
just
as
he
was
about
to
do
so
he
thought
he
heard
some
one
inside
he
stepped
up
close
to
the
lodge
and
looked
in
through
a
little
opening
between
the
door
and
the
lodge
and
saw
a
small
fire
burning
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
fire
was
sitting
a
young
girl
combing
her
long
hair
the
young
man
looked
around
the
lodge
to
see
who
else
was
there
and
saw
only
an
old
man
and
an
old
woman
and
the
he
cut
the
ropes
of
the
two
spotted
horses
standing
outside
led
the
horses
out
of
the
camp
and
met
his
companion
to
him
he
said
now
brother
you
take
these
horses
and
go
to
the
hill
where
we
were
hiding
and
wait
for
me
there
i
have
seen
another
fine
spotted
horse
that
i
want
to
get
i
will
go
back
for
it
and
will
meet
you
before
morning
at
that
place
he
went
back
as
if
to
get
the
spotted
horse
but
returned
to
the
lodge
where
the
girl
was
he
went
all
around
it
and
looked
at
it
carefully
he
saw
that
there
were
feathers
on
the
lodge
and
rows
of
animals
hoofs
hanging
down
the
sides
which
rattled
in
the
wind
and
to
one
of
the
was
tied
a
buffalo
tail
which
hung
down
then
he
went
back
to
the
door
and
looked
in
at
the
girl
again
she
had
braided
her
hair
and
was
sitting
there
by
the
fire
he
stayed
there
a
long
time
that
night
looking
at
her
toward
morning
he
went
to
look
for
his
companion
when
he
met
him
he
told
him
that
some
one
had
taken
the
spotted
horse
before
he
got
to
it
he
could
not
find
it
when
the
party
all
met
next
morning
they
found
that
they
had
taken
a
lot
of
horses
and
they
started
north
to
go
home
they
reached
the
pawnee
village
and
every
one
was
glad
of
their
success
after
this
whenever
this
young
man
saw
anything
that
was
nice
or
pretty
such
as
medals
finger
rings
for
women
beadwork
leggings
bracelets
necklaces
wampum
beads
things
that
the
comanches
did
not
have
he
would
give
a
pony
for
it
for
one
year
he
went
on
like
this
gathering
together
these
pretty
things
when
the
year
had
gone
by
he
had
no
horses
left
he
had
given
them
all
away
to
get
these
presents
he
packed
all
these
things
up
in
a
bundle
and
then
spoke
one
night
to
his
friend
saying

intend
to
go
off
on
the
warpath

would
like
to

it
was
now

middle
of
the
night
when
he
came
to
the
lodge
he
saw
there
was
a
fire
in
it
he
did
not
go
in
at
once
he
wanted
the
fire
to
go
out
he
stayed
around
the
lodge
and
gradually
the
fire
died
down
it
was
dark
he
went
into
the
lodge
he
was
painted
and
finely
dressed
and
had
his
bundle
with
him
he
took
his
moccasins
off
and
his
leggings
and
hung
them
up
over
the
girl
bed
then
strings
of
beads
then
five
or
six
medals
bracelets
beaded
leggings
everything
he
had
his
shirt
he
took
his
blanket
and
spread
it
over
the
bed
where
the
girl
was
lying
stepped
over
the
bed
and
crept
under
his
own
blanket
and
lay
down
by
her
side
when
he
lay
down
she
woke
up
and
found
that
there
was
some
one
lying
by
her
and
she
spoke
to
him
but
he
did
not
answer
he
could
not
understand
her
for
he
did
not
know
comanche
she
talked
for
a
long
time
but
he
did
not
speak
then
she
began
to
feel
of
him
and
when
she
put
her
hands
on
his
head
pawnee
an
enemy
then
she
raised
herself
up
took
a
handful
of
grass
from
under
the
bed
spread
the
fire
and
put
the
grass
on
it
the
fire
blazed
up
and
she
saw
him
then
she
sprang
up
and
took
the
top
blanket
which
was
his
off
the
bed
and
put
it
about
her
and
sat
by
the
fire
she
called
her
father
and
said
father
get
up
there
is
a
man
here
the
old
man
got
up
and
got
his
pipe
and
began
smoking
this
old
man

the
head
chief
of
the
comanches
he
called
the
servant
and
told
him
to
make
a
fire
the
girl
got
up
and
went
over
to
where
her
mother
was
lying
and
called
her
the
mother
got
up
and
they
all
sat
by
the
fire
the
old
man
smoked
for
a
long
time
every
now
and
then
he
would
look
at
the
bed
to
see
who
it
could
be
that
was
lying
there
and
then
he
would
look
at
all
the
things
hanging
up
over
the
bed
at
the
medals
and
other
things
he
did
not
know
what
they
were
for
and
he
wondered
at
length
the
old
man
told
the
servant
to
go
and
call
the
chiefs
of
the
tribe
and
tell
them
to
come
to
his
lodge
presently
the
chiefs
came
in
one
by
one
and
sat
down
when
they
had
come
there
was
still
one
brave
who
ought
to
have
come
that
was
not
there
his
name
was
skin
shirt
the
father
wanted
him
he
sent
for
him
three
times
he
sent
word
back
to
the
chief
to
go
on
with
the
council
and
that
he
would
agree
to
whatever
they
decided
the
fourth
time
he
was
sent
for
he
came
and
took
a
seat
by
the
chief
the
girl
father
this
brave
spoke
to
and
told
him
to
get
up
and
take
a
seat
among
them
he
did
so
the
girl
was
sitting
on
the
other
side
of
the
fire
when
he
got
up
he
had
to
take
the
blanket
that
was
left
which
was
the
girl
he
put
it
around
him
and
sat
down
among
them
when
the
chiefs
came
in
there
was
among
them
a
pawnee
who
had
been
captured
long
ago
and
adopted
by
the
comanches
and
was
now
himself
a
chief
he
talked
with
and
interpreted
for
him
telling
him
everything
that
was
said
as
each
one
spoke
after
the
young
man
had
seated
himself
the
chief
filled
his
pipe
and
gave
the
pipe
to
his
brave
to
decide
what
should
be
done
with
this
enemy
the
brave
took
the
pipe
but
he
did
not
wish
to
decide
so
he
did
not
light
it
but
passed
it
on
to
another
chief
to
decide
he
passed
it
on
to
another
and
he
to
another
and
so
it
went
until
the
pipe
came
back
to
the
head
chief
when
he
got
it
again
he
asked
why
have
you
come
here
this
night
and
lain
down
in
my
lodge
you
who
are
an
enemy
to
my
people
and
why
have
you
hung
up
in
the
lodge
all
these
strange
things
which
we
see
here
i
do
not
understand
it
and
i
wish
to
know
your
reasons
the
boy
said
to
him
a
long
time
ago
i
came
south
on
the
warpath
to
steal
horses
i
traveled
until
i
came
to
your
camp
i
saw
three
horses
tied
outside
a
lodge
two
spotted
horses
and
a
gray
while
i
was
cutting
one
of
the
ropes
i
heard
a
little
noise
inside
the
lodge
and
pushing
aside
the
door
i
looked
in
and
saw
that
girl
combing
her
hair
i
stole
the
two
spotted
horses
and
took
them
out
of
the
camp
and
gave
them
to
a
friend
of
mine
and
came
back
to
your
lodge
and
kept
looking
at
the
girl
i
stayed
there
until
she
went
to
bed
for
a
long
year
i
have
been
buying
presents
beads
and
many
other
things
for
i
had
made
up
my
mind
that
i
would
go
after
this
girl
i
came
down
here
to
find
her
i
have
been
to
where
you
were
camped
last
year
and
to
two
other
camps
that
i
discovered
she
was
not
in
these
and
i
left
them
and
came
on
until
i
found
the
right
camp
this
is
the
fourth
place
now
i
am
here
i
made
up
my
mind
to
do
this
thing
and
if
her
relations
do
not
like
it
they
can
do
as
they
please
i
would
be
happy
to
die
on
her
account
when
he
had
spoken
the
old
chief
laughed
he
said
those
two
spotted
horses
that
you
stole
i
did
not
care
much
about
the
gray
horse
was
the
best
one
of
the
three
and
you
left
him
i
was
glad
that
you
did
not
take
him
he
was
the
best
of
all
then
for
a
little
while
there
was
silence
in
the
lodge
then
the
chief
the
girl
father
began
to
talk
again
he
said
if
i
wanted
to
decide
what
should
be
done
with
this
man
i
would
decide
right
now
but
here
is
my
brave
skin
shirt
i
want
him
to
decide
if
i
were
to
decide
it
would
be
against
this
man
but
he
has
my
daughter
blanket
on
and
she
has
his
and
i
do
not
want
to
decide
i
pass
the
pipe
to
my
brave
and
want
him
to
light
it
the
brave
said
i
want
this
chief
next
to
me
to
decide
and
he
passed
him
the
pipe
and
so
it
went
on
around
the
circle
until
it
came
to
the
head
chief
again
he
was
just
about
to
take
it
and
decide
the
question
when
they
heard
outside
the
lodge
the
noise
made
by
some
one
coming
shouting
and
laughing
then
the
door
was
pushed
aside
and
an
old
man
came
in
and
as
he
passed
the
door
he
stumbled
and
fell
on
his
knees
it
was
the
girl
grandfather
he
had
been
outside
the
lodge
listening
the
pipe
was
passed
to
the
chief
and
he
gave
it
again
to
his
brave
to
decide
while
the
brave
was
sitting
there
holding
the
pipe
the
old
grandfather
said
give
me
the
pipe
if
you
men
can
not
decide
let
me
do
it
in
my
time
we
did
not
do
things
this
way
i
never
passed
the
pipe
i
could
always
decide
for
myself
then
skin
shirt
passed
him
the
pipe
and
he
lit
it
and
smoked
then
he
said
i
do
not
wish
to
condemn
to
death
a
man
who
is
wearing
my
granddaughter
blanket
the
interpreter
began
to
tell
that
the
old
man
was
going
to
decide
in
his
favor
and
that
when
he
got
through
speaking
he
must
get
up
and
pass
his
hands
over
him
and
thank
him
for
taking
pity
on
him
and
so
to
all
the
others
the
old
man
continued
now
chiefs
do
not
think
hardly
of
what
i
am
going
to
say
nor
be
dissatisfied
with
my
decision
i
am
old
i
have
heard
in
my
time
that
there
is
a
tribe
up
north
that
is
raising
from
the
ground
something
that
is
long
and
white
and
something
that
is
round
and
that
these
things
are
good
to
eat
now
chiefs
before
i
die
i
want
to
eat
of
these
things
and
i
want
my
granddaughter
to
go
and
take
her
seat
by
this
man
and
for
them
to
be
man
and
wife
since
i
was
young
we
have
been
enemies
but
now
i
want
the
two
tribes
to
come
together
join
hands
and
be
friends
and
so
it
was
decided
the
young
man
got
up
and
passed
his
hands
over
the
old
man
and
over
the
brave
and
passed
around
the
circle
and
blessed
them
all
the
pawnee
who
was
interpreter
now
told
him
to
get
up
and
get
a
medal
and
put
it
on
the
brave
and
then
another
and
put
it
on
the
chief
and
so
on
until
all
the
presents
were
gone
and
he
did
so
and
put
on
them
the
medals
and
and
strings
of
beads
and
of
wampum
until
each
had
something
and
these
things
were
new
to
them
and
they
felt
proud
to
be
wearing
them
and
thought
how
nice
they
looked
iv
by
this
time
it
was
daylight
and
it
had
got
noised
abroad
through
the
camp
that
there
was
a
pawnee
at
the
head
chief
lodge
and
all
the
people
gathered
there
they
called
out
bring
him
out
we
want
him
out
here
they
crowded
about
the
lodge
all
the
people
the
old
men
and
the
women
and
the
young
men
so
many
that
at
last
they
pushed
the
lodge
down
they
shouted
let
us
have
the
pawnee
last
night
they
stole
many
horses
from
us
the
chiefs
and
braves
got
around
the
pawnee
and
kept
the
comanches
off
from
him
and
protected
him
from
the
people
the
cheyennes
were
camped
close
by
near
the
hill
southeast
of
the
comanches
and
they
too
had
heard
that
the
comanches
had
a
pawnee
in
the
camp
they
came
over
and
rode
about
in
the
crowd
to
try
and
get
the
pawnee
and
they
rode
over
a
comanche
or
two
and
knocked
them
down
so
skin
shirt
got
his
bow
and
arrows
and
jumped
on
his
horse
and
rode
out
and
drove
the
cheyennes
away
back
to
their
camp
again
the
cheyennes
saw
that
the
comanches
did
not
want
the
pawnee
killed
so
they
sent
a
message
inviting
him
over
to
a
feast
with
them
intending
to
kill
him
but
skin
shirt
told
them
that
he
was
married
into
the
tribe
while
the
cheyennes
were
parading
round
the
comanche
camp
they
were
shooting
off
their
guns
in
the
air
just
to
make
a
noise
now
the
young
pawnee
on
the
hill
who
was
watching
the
camp
to
see
what
would
happen
to
his
friend
saw
the
crowd
and
heard
the
shooting
and
made
up
his
mind
that
had
been
killed
so
he
took
his
knife
and
put
the
handle
against
a
tree
and
the
point
against
his
breast
and
put
his
arms
around
the
tree
and
hugged
it
and
the
knife
blade
passed
through
his
heart
and
he
fell
down
and
died
in
the
afternoon
when
all
the
excitement
had
quieted
down
the
cheyennes
came
over
again
to
the
comanche
camp
and
invited
the
pawnee
and
his
wife
to
go
to
their
village
and
visit
with
them
then
skin
shirt
said
all
right
we
will
go
three
chiefs
of
the
comanches
went
ahead
the
pawnee
followed
with
his
wife
and
skin
shirt
went
behind
they
went
to
the
cheyenne
camp
the
cheyennes
received
them
and
made
a
great
feast
for
them
and
gave
the
pawnee
many
horses
then
they
went
back
to
the
comanche
camp
never
went
up
to
the
hill
until
the
next
morning
then
he
went
singing
the
song
he
had
told
his
friend
he
would
sing
he
called
to
him
but
there
was
no
reply
he
called
again
it
was
all
silent
he
looked
for
his
friend
and
at
last
he
found
him
there
dead
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
then
stayed
with
the
comanches
the
cheyennes
came
north
and
east
and
the
comanches
went
on
west
nearer
to
the
mountains
while
the
pawnee
was
with
the
comanches
they
had
several
wars
with
the
utes
lipans
and
tonkaways
proved
himself
a
brave
man
and
as
the
of
the
chief
he
soon
gained
great
influence
and
was
himself
made
a
chief
after
some
years
the
old
man
his
wife
grandfather
told
the
pawnee
that
he
thought
it
was
time
that
he
should
eat
some
of
those
things
that
he
had
long
wanted
to
eat
that
grew
up
north
that
he
was
getting
pretty
old
now
said
it
is
time
we
will
go
so
he
had
his
horses
packed
and
with
his
immediate
family
and
the
old
man
started
north
toward
the
pawnee
country
at
this
time
he
was
called
which
means
see
the
hawk
when
going
into
battle
he
would
ride
straight
out
to
strike
his
enemy
and
the
comanches
who
were
looking
at
him
would
say
see
the
hawk
so
that
became
his
name
they
traveled
a
long
time
until
they
came
to
the
pawnee
ground
as
they
were
traveling
along
they
came
to
a
field
where
were
growing
corn
beans
and
squashes
the
pawnee
said
to
the
old
man
grandfather
look
at
that
field
there
are
the
things
that
you
have
desired
to
eat
he
got
off
his
horse
and
went
into
the
field
and
pulled
some
corn
some
beans
and
some
squashes
and
took
them
to
the
old
man
and
gave
them
to
him
the
old
man
supposed
they
were
to
be
eaten
just
as
they
were
and
he
tried
to
bite
the
squashes
this
made
the
pawnee
laugh
when
they
came
to
the
village
the
pawnees
were
very
glad
to
see
him
who
had
been
lost
long
ago
he
told
the
people
that
he
had
brought
these
indians
to
eat
of
the
corn
and
other
things
that
they
were
his
kinsfolk
he
told
them
too
about
the
young
man
who
had
killed
himself
his
relations
went
out
into
the
fields
and
gathered
corn
and
beans
and
squashes
and
cooked
them
for
the
comanches
they
stayed
there
a
long
time
at
the
pawnee
village
when
they
were
getting
ready
to
return
the
pawnees
dried
their
corn
and
gave
a
great
deal
of
it
to
the
comanches
packing
many
horses
with
it
for
the
indians
at
home
then
the
comanches
started
south
again
and
some
of
the
pawnee
young
men
relations
of
joined
him
and
went
back
with
them
after
they
had
returned
to
the
comanche
camp
the
old
grandfather
died
happy
because
he
had
eaten
the
things
he
wanted
to
eat
soon
after
this
started
back
to
the
pawnee
village
and
some
young
men
of
the
comanches
joined
him
some
time
after
reaching
the
village
he
went
south
again
accompanied
by
some
young
pawnees
but
leaving
most
of
the
comanches
behind
he
had
arranged
with
the
chiefs
of
the
pawnees
that
they
should
journey
south
meet
the
comanches
on
the
plains
and
make
peace
when
he
reached
the
comanches
the
whole
village
started
north
to
visit
the
pawnees
and
met
them
on
their
way
south
when
they
met
the
two
tribes
made
friends
smoked
together
ate
together
became
friends
after
they
had
camped
together
for
some
time
some
comanches
stayed
in
the
pawnee
camp
and
some
pawnees
in
the
comanche
camp
was
called
by
the
pawnees
comanche
chief
he
would
have
remained
with
the
comanches
but
when
he
went
back
with
them
his
wife
fell
sick
the
comanche
doctors
could
not
help
her
and
he
wanted
to
take
her
north
to
see
the
pawnee
doctors
but
the
comanches
would
not
let
him
they
kept
him
there
and
his
wife
died
then
he
was
angry
for
he
thought
if
he
had
taken
her
north
her
life
might
have
been
saved
so
he
left
the
comanches
and
went
and
lived
with
the
pawnees
and
was
known
among
them
always
as
comanche
chief
the
because
he
made
peace
between
the
pawnees
and
comanches
he
was
chief
of
the

a
progressive

lone

the
son
of
the

his
father
died
when
the
boy
was
very
young
less
than
a
year
old
until
he
was
old
enough
to
go
to
war
his
mother
had
supported
him
by
farming
raising
corn

and
pumpkins
she
taught
the
boy
many
things
and
advised
him
how
to
live
and
how
to
act
so
that
he
might
be
successful
she
used
to
say
to
him
you
must
trust
always
in
he
made
us
and
through
him
we
live
when
you
grow
up
you
must
be
a
man
be
brave
and
face
whatever
danger
may
meet
you
do
not
forget
when
you
look
back
to
your
young
days
that
i
have
raised
you
and
always
supported
you
you
had
no
father
to
do
it
your
father
was
a
chief
but
you
must
not
think
of
that
because
he
was
a
chief
it
does
not
follow
that
you
will
be
one
it
is
not
the
man
who
stays
in
the
lodge
that
becomes
great
it
is
the
man
who
works
who
sweats
who
is
always
tired
from
going
on
the
warpath
much
good
advice
his
mother
gave
him
she
said
when
you
get
to
be
a
man
remember
that
it
is
his
ambition
that
makes
the
man
if
you
go
on
the
warpath
do
not
turn
around
when
you
have
gone
part
way
but
go
on
as
far
as
you
were
going
and
then
come
back
if
i
should
live
to
see
you
become
a
man
i
want
you
to
become
a
great
man
i
want
you
to
think
about
the
hard
times
we
have
been
through
take
pity
on
people
who
are
poor
because
we
have
been
poor
and
people
have
taken
pity
on
us
if
i
live
to
see
you
a
man
and
to
go
off
on
the
warpath
i
would
not
cry
if
i
were
to
hear
that
you
had
been
killed
in
battle
that
is
what
makes
a
man
to
fight
and
to
be
brave
i
should
be
sorry
to
see
you
die
from
sickness
if
you
are
killed
i
would
rather
have
you
die
in
the
open
air
so
that
the
birds
of
the
air
will
eat
your
flesh
and
the
wind
will
breathe
on
you
and
blow
over
your
bones
it
is
better
to
be
killed
in
the
open
air
than
to
be
smothered
in
the
earth
love
your
friend
and
never
desert
him
if
you
see
him
surrounded
by
the
enemy
do
not
run
away
go
to
him
and
if
you
can
not
save
him
be
killed
together
and
let
your
bones
lie
side
by
side
be
killed
on
a
hill
high
up
your
grandfather
said
it
is
not
manly
to
be
killed
in
a
hollow
it
is
not
a
man
who
is
talking
to
you
advising
you
heed
my
words
even
if
i
am
a
woman
the
boy
listened
to
these
words
and
he
did
not
forget
them
ii
in
the
year
he
enlisted
in
the
pawnee
scouts
under
major
frank
north
and
served
in
north
company
he
was
always
a
good
soldier
ready
willing
and
brave
at
a
fight
near
the
cheyenne
pass
in
he
counted
on
a
woman
and
a
man
arapahoes
who
had
stolen
some
horses
at
fort
laramie
at
this
time
the
boy
name
was
running
chief
after
he
came
back
from
this
scout
he
went
on
a
war
party
of
which
left
hand
was
the
leader
and
they
went
to
the
osage
country
he
was
no
longer
a
servant
but
a
scout
a
leading
man
in
the
party
one
of
those
who
went
ahead
as
spies
he
had
good
judgment
and
understood
his
duties
when
they
came
to
the
osage
country
he
was
selected
as
one
of
the
leaders
of
a
small
branch
party
to
steal
horses
his
party
took
thirty
head
of
horses
in
the
osage
country
the
young
men
were
not
allowed
to
take
all
the
horses
they
could
on
account
of
the
few
fords
where
they
could
cross
the
streams
they
could
not
take
a
big
herd
but
only
what
they
could
ride
and
lead
and
at
the
same
time
go
fast
across
one
river
there
was
only
one
rocky
ford
and
over
another
stream
with
deep
banks
there
was
only
one
rocky
ford
where
they
could
cross
because
they
did
not
know
this
in
former
times
many
pawnees
had
been
caught
and
killed
in
the
osage
country
so
now
they
took
but
few
horses
at
a
time
because
these
rivers
were
very
deep
and
no
one
could
cross
them
except
at
these
rock
fords
out
of
the
horses
taken
at
this
time
running
chief
obtained
one
of
the
best
and
fastest
ever
known
among
the
pawnees
a
horse
long
famous
in
the
tribe
for
his
skillful
leadership
of
this
party
he
was
given
much
credit
after
returning
home
the
same
year
he
led
a
party
to
go
off
on
the
warpath
to
the
cheyennes
he
found
a
camp
on
the
headwaters
of
the
north
canadian
and
his
party
took
seven
horses
but
these
horses
looked
thin
and
rough
and
he
was
not
satisfied
with
them
he
was
ashamed
to
go
home
with
only
these
he
told
his
party
to
take
them
home
but
that
he
was
going
off
by
himself
to
get
some
better
ones
he
had
with
him
a
friend
with
whom
he
had
grown
up
and
whom
he
loved
this
young
man
was
like
a
brother
to
running
chief
these
two
went
off
together
and
went
to
the
osage
camp
and
staid
about
it
for
three
nights
and
then
took
five
horses
the
best
in
the
camp
they
took
them
back
to
the
village
it
was
customary
for
the
leading
man
in
a
party
to
make
a
sacrifice
to
running
chief
did
this
giving
one
horse
to
the
chief
priest
this
sacrifice
promoted
him
to
be
a
warrior
iii
the
next
year
he
led
a
party
again
to
the
osage
country
he
took
some
horses
and
brought
them
home
this
same
year
a
party
started
south
he
was
not
the
leader
but
he
went
with
them
they
went
to
the
wichita
comanche
and
kiowa
villages
they
were
all
camped
together
stole
some
horses
and
started
back
with
them
before
they
had
gone
very
far
running
chief
stopped
and
said
he
was
going
back
his
friend
was
with
the
party
and
when
he
found
that
running
chief
had
resolved
to
go
back
he
said
i
will
stop
here
with
you
the
two
went
back
toward
the
village
that
they
had
just
left
and
climbed
a
hill
that
stood
near
it
and
hid
themselves
there
they
waited
watching
for
they
had
not
decided
what
they
would
do
the
next
day
in
the
afternoon
they
began
to
get
hungry
and
they
began
to
talk
together
running
chief
said
to
his
friend
my
brother
are
you
poor
in
your
mind
do
you
feel
like
doing
some
great
thing
something
that
is
very
dangerous
poor
in
mind
despondent
unhappy
miserable
his
friend
answered
at
once
yes
i
am
poor
i
am
ready
why
do
you
ask
me
running
chief
thought
a
little
while
before
he
answered
and
as
he
thought
all
the
pain
and
suffering
of
his
life
seemed
to
rise
up
before
him
so
that
he
could
see
it
he
remembered
how
he
had
been
a
poor
boy
supported
by
his
mother
and
all
that
they
two
had
suffered
together
while
he
was
yet
a
child
he
remembered
how
his
sister
had
been
killed
when
he
was
a
boy
only
ten
years
old
and
how
he
had
mourned
for
her
when
her
husband
who
was
jealous
of
her
had
shot
her
through
the
body
with
an
arrow
and
killed
her
she
was
the
only
sister
he
had
and
he
had
loved
her
he
felt
that
he
was
poor
now
and
that
there
was
no
hope
of
anything
better
for
him
and
he
did
not
want
to
live
any
longer
after
he
had
thought
of
all
these
things
he
said
to
his
friend
my
life
is
not
worth
anything
to
me
and
then
he
told
him
of
his
bad
feelings
finally
he
said
now
you
go
off
and
leave
me
here
alone
i
am
tired
of
living
but
you
go
home
you
have
relations
who
would
mourn
for
you
i
do
not
want
you
to
lose
your
life
on
my
account
his
friend
answered
him
i
will
not
go
away
from
you
we
have
grown
up
together
and
i
will
stick
to
you
wherever
you
go
i
will
go
and
whatever
you
do
i
will
do
then
running
chief
meditated
for
a
long
time
he
had
not
made
up
his
mind
what
to
do
he
thought
to
himself
this
my
friend
will
stay
with
me
i
do
not
want
to
be
the
cause
of
his
death
so
he
considered
finally
he
said
to
his
friend
if
i
shall
make
up
my
mind
to
go
to
some
place
where
there
is
great
danger
i
shall
go
his
friend
said
i
will
go
with
you
running
chief
thought
again
and
at
last
he
said
on
account
of
my
feelings
i
have
decided
to
go
into
the
camp
of
my
enemies
and
be
eaten
by
their
dogs
the
other
man
said
whatever
you
have
determined
on
i
also
will
do
iv
then
they
jumped
up
out
of
the
hole
they
were
hiding
in
and
tied
up
their
waists
and
prepared
to
start
they
were
not
very
far
from
a
trail
which
connected
two
villages
along
which
persons
kept
passing
and
the
indians
of
these
villages
were
all
about
them
when
they
jumped
up
to
go
toward
the
trail
they
saw
four
or
five
persons
passing
at
a
little
distance
when
they
saw
these
people
running
chief
called
out
to
them
and
made
motions
for
them
to
come
to
him
he
wanted
to
show
his
strong
will
and
that
on
account
of
his
bad
feelings
he
wished
to
have
his
troubles
ended
right
there
he
called
to
them
twice
and
each
time
the
indians
stopped
and
looked
at
the
pawnees
and
then
went
on
they
did
not
know
who
it
was
that
was
calling
them
perhaps
they
thought
the
pawnees
were
two
squaws
the
two
young
men
went
out
to
the
trail
and
followed
these
persons
toward
the
village
they
went
over
a
little
hill
and
as
soon
as
they
had
come
to
the
top
and
looked
over
it
they
saw
the
village
on
this
side
of
it
and
nearest
to
them
were
three
lodges
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
was
a
river
which
they
must
cross
to
come
to
these
three
lodges
when
they
came
to
the
river
the
friend
asked
shall
we
take
off
our
moccasins
and
leggings
to
cross
running
chief
replied
why
should
i
take
off
my
moccasins
and
leggings
when
i
know
that
my
life
is
just
going
over
a
precipice
let
us
go
in
as
we
are
so
they
crossed
with
moccasins
and
leggings
on
the
river
was
only
deep
just
as
they
reached
the
further
bank
all
on
a
sudden
it
came
over
running
chief
what
they
were
doing
that
they
were
going
to
certain
death
all
his
courage
seemed
to
leave
him
and
he
felt
as
if
he
had
no
bones
in
his
body
then
for
a
moment
he
faltered
but
he
could
not
give
up
now
he
felt
that
if
he
was
a
man
he
must
go
forward
he
could
not
turn
back
he
stopped
for
an
instant
and
his
friend
looked
at
him
and
said
come
let
us
hurry
on
we
are
near
the
lodges
he
stepped
forward
then
but
his
feet
seemed
to
be
heavy
and
to
drag
on
the
ground
he
walked
as
if
he
were
asleep
there
was
no
one
about
near
at
hand
and
as
they
went
forward
running
chief
prayed
with
all
his
mind
to
that
no
one
might
come
until
they
had
reached
the
lodge
and
had
got
inside
when
they
had
got
to
within
about
one
hundred
yards
of
the
lodge
a
little
boy
came
out
and
began
to
play
around
the
door
and
when
they
were
about
fifty
yards
from
him
he
saw
them
as
soon
as
he
looked
at
them
he
knew
that
they
did
not
belong
to
the
camp
and
he
gave
a
kind
of
a
scream
and
darted
into
the
lodge
but
no
one
came
out
the
people
within
paid
no
attention
to
the
boy
as
they
walked
toward
the
lodges
running
chief
seemed
not
to
know
where
he
was
but
to
be
walking
in
a
dream
he
thought
of
nothing
except
his
longing
to
get
to
this
lodge
they
went
to
the
largest
of
the
three
lodges
running
chief
raised
the
door
and
put
his
head
in
and
as
he
did
so
it
seemed
as
if
his
breath
stopped
he
went
in
and
sat
down
far
back
in
the
lodge
opposite
the
entrance
and
though
his
breath
was
stopped
his
heart
was
beating
like
a
drum
his
friend
had
followed
him
in
and
sat
down
beside
him
both
had
their
bows
in
their
hands
strung
and
a
sheaf
of
arrows
when
they
entered
the
lodge
the
man
who
was
lying
down
at
the
back
of
the
lodge
uttered
a
loud
exclamation
and
then
seemed
struck
dumb
a
plate
of
corn
mush
had
just
been
handed
him
but
he
did
not
take
it
and
it
sat
there
on
the
ground
by
him
one
woman
was
just
raising
a
buffalo
horn
spoon
of
mush
to
her
mouth
but
her
hand
stopped
before
reaching
it
and
she
stared
at
them
holding
the
mush
before
her
face
another
woman
was
ladling
some
mush
into
a
plate
and
she
held
the
plate
in
one
hand
and
the
ladle
above
it
and
looked
at
them
without
moving
they
all
seemed
turned
into
stone
as
the
two
pawnees
sat
there
running
chief
breath
suddenly
came
back
to
him
before
it
had
all
been
dark
about
him
as
if
he
had
been
asleep
but
now
the
clouds
had
cleared
away
and
he
could
see
the
road
ahead
of
him
now
he
felt
a
man
and
brave
as
he
looked
around
him
and
saw
the
man
lying
motionless
and
one
woman
just
ready
to
take
a
mouthful
and
the
other
woman
with
the
ladle
held
over
the
dish
he
perceived
that
they
could
not
move
they
were
so
astonished
at
length
the
wichita
had
come
to
his
senses
he
drew
a
long
breath
and
sat
up
and
for
a
while
looked
at
the
two
pawnees
then
he
made
some
sign
to
them
which
they
did
not
understand
but
they
guessed
that
he
was
trying
to
ask
who
they
were
running
chief
struck
his
breast
and
said
pawnee
as
soon
as
the
wichita
heard
that
he
caught
his
breath
and
heaved
a
long
sigh
he
did
not
know
what
to
think
of
two
pawnees
coming
into
his
lodge
he
could
not
think
what
it
meant
he
drew
a
long
breath
he
did
not
touch
his
plate
of
food
but
motioned
a
woman
to
take
it
away
presently
he
called
to
some
one
in
the
neighboring
lodge
he
was
answered
and
in
a
moment
a
man
came
in
he
called
again
and
another
entered
and
the
three
looked
for
a
long
time
at
the
two
pawnees
these
were
sitting
motionless
but
watching
like
two
wildcats
to
see
what
was
going
to
happen
each
had
his
bow
and
arrows
by
his
side
and
his
knife
inside
his
robe
at
length
the
owner
of
the
lodge
spoke
and
one
of
the
men
went
out
and
after
a
little
they
heard
the
sound
of
horses
hoofs
coming
and
they
supposed
some
one
was
riding
up
every
now
and
then
running
chief
would
touch
his
friend
knee
with
his
own
as
if
to
say
watch
the
owner
of
the
lodge
made
a
sign
and
pointed
to
the
east
and
said
at
the
same
time
he
was
dressing
himself
up
putting
on
a
pair
of
officer
trousers
and
a
uniform
coat
meantime
the
pawnees
heard
the
rattle
of
one
saddle
and
then
of
another
the
wichita
chief
put
on
his
blanket
and
his
pistol
belt
around
it
and
then
made
signs
for
them
to
go
out
he
led
the
way
and
the
pawnees
followed
as
they
went
running
chief
touched
his
friend
as
if
to
say
watch
they
may
shoot
us
as
we
go
out
but
when
they
looked
out
of
the
lodge
the
wichita
was
walking
toward
the
horses
so
there
was
no
danger
he
mounted
a
horse
and
signed
to
running
chief
to
get
up
behind
him
another
man
mounted
the
other
horse
and
the
friend
got
up
behind
him
a
spanish
word
meaning
chief
as
they
rode
toward
the
main
village
it
came
into
the
mind
of
running
chief
to
kill
the
man
he
was
riding
behind
and
to
ride
away
there
was
where
he
had
to
fight
his
hardest
battle
he
was
tempted
to
kill
this
man
in
front
of
him
but
he
was
not
overpowered
by
this
temptation
he
overcame
it
he
thought
that
perhaps
he
might
be
mounted
on
a
poor
horse
and
even
if
he
did
kill
this
man
and
his
friend
the
other
they
might
be
on
slow
horses
and
be
caught
at
once
every
little
while
he
would
look
at
his
friend
and
roll
his
eyes
as
if
to
say
watch
on
your
side
and
i
will
watch
on
mine
as
he
came
near
to
the
village
the
wichita
warrior
called
out
and
began
to
sing
a
song
and
all
at
once
the
village
was
in
an
uproar
the
men
women
and
children
seemed
to
start
up
out
of
the
ground
and
the
lodges
poured
forth
their
inmates
running
chief
felt
that
he
was
in
danger
but
he
knew
that
he
was
not
in
as
much
danger
as
the
man
before
him
he
could
take
the
pistol
out
of
the
belt
that
he
had
hold
of
and
kill
him
or
he
could
use
his
own
knife
the
wichita
knew
that
he
was
in
danger
he
knew
that
he
was
in
the
power
of
the
enemy
after
the
wichita
had
called
out
to
the
people
that
they
had
enemies
with
them
he
kept
on
talking
saying
keep
quiet
do
not
do
anything
wait
keep
away
from
me
and
be
still
i
am
in
danger
they
would
not
have
listened
to
him
if
it
had
not
been
that
he
was
a
leading
man
and
a
brave
warrior
the
riders
came
to
the
largest
lodge
which
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
village
here
they
stopped
when
running
chief
got
off
the
horse
he
held
tightly
the
belt
of
the
wichita
who
dismounted
and
they
went
together
into
the
lodge
of
the
head
chief
and
the
others
followed
and
went
in
and
all
sat
down
opposite
the
door
all
this
time
there
was
a
hubbub
outside
people
were
flying
from
their
lodges
to
that
of
the
head
chief
and
lifting
up
the
edge
of
the
lodge
and
peeping
under
it
at
the
pawnees
they
chattered
to
each
other
and
called
out
to
those
who
were
coming
all
was
noise
and
confusion
the
under
chiefs
came
in
one
by
one
until
all
were
present
then
one
of
them
made
a
speech
saying
that
it
would
be
best
to
leave
everything
to
the
head
chief
and
that
he
should
decide
what
ought
to
be
done
with
these
enemies
then
it
was
silent
for
a
time
while
the
chief
was
making
up
his
mind
what
should
be
done
and
during
this
silence
running
chief
felt
a
touch
on
his
shoulder
and
looked
behind
him
and
there
was
handed
to
him
under
the
edge
of
the
lodge
a
dish
of
meat
he
took
it
and
began
to
eat
and
his
companion
also
ate
with
him
after
he
had
eaten
a
few
mouthfuls
he
took
his
arrows
which
he
had
held
in
his
hand
and
put
them
in
his
quiver
and
unstrung
his
bow
and
laid
it
aside
and
his
friend
did
the
same
then
the
chief
stood
up
and
spoke
to
those
sitting
there
and
said
what
can
i
do
they
have
eaten
of
my
food
i
can
not
make
war
on
people
who
have
been
eating
with
me
while
he
was
saying
this
running
chief
was
again
touched
on
the
shoulder
and
some
one
handed
him
a
cup
of
water
and
he
drank
and
the
chief
as
he
saw
this
added
and
have
also
drunk
of
my
water
he
then
turned
and
called
to
a
certain
man
who
could
speak
pawnee
and
told
him
to
ask
these
men
if
they
were
on
the
warpath
he
asked
them
are
you
on
the
warpath
and
they
replied
yes
we
are
on
the
warpath
then
said
he
what
are
you
here
for
running
chief
answered
you
have
plenty
of
dogs
i
am
here
that
my
body
may
be
eaten
by
them
when
the
wichitas
heard
this
they
all
made
a
sound
for
they
were
surprised
at
his
bravery
the
chief
asked
him
do
you
know
anything
about
the
horses
that
were
missed
last
night
he
said
yes
where
are
they
said
the
head
chief
running
chief
replied
the
party
have
gone
off
with
them
pawnees
were
you
with
them
yes
i
was
with
them
and
i
stopped
behind
on
purpose
to
come
into
your
village
the
head
chief
then
turned
to
the
others
and
talked
for
a
little
while
he
said
see
what
a
brave
man
this
is
he
had
resolved
to
die
but
he
shall
not
die
because
he
has
eaten
our
food
and
drunk
of
our
water
although
we
are
enemies
of
this
man
tribe
yet
we
are
the
same
people
with
them
who
have
been
apart
for
a
long
time
i
can
not
help
it
my
heart
is
touched
by
his
talk
and
by
their
bravery
by
their
bravery
they
are
safe
and
all
the
wichitas
said
then
the
head
chief
through
the
interpreter
talked
to
running
chief
he
said
are
you
a
chief
running
chief
replied
no
i
am
not
a
chief
i
am
like
a
dog
i
am
poor
the
head
chief
said
to
him
by
your
bravery
you
have
saved
yourselves
you
shall
have
the
road
to
your
home
made
white
before
you
let
there
not
be
one
blood
spot
on
it
then
he
turned
to
those
who
were
sitting
about
the
lodge
and
said
now
my
young
men
do
something
for
them
a
young
man
named
crazy
wolf
stood
up
and
spoke
and
when
he
had
finished
the
interpreter
said
that
man
has
given
you
a
black
horse
the
best
that
he
has
another
young
man
on
the
other
side
of
the
lodge
spoke
and
the
interpreter
said
he
has
given
you
a
roan
horse
the
best
that
he
has
then
all
the
wichitas
began
to
speak
at
once
and
before
they
knew
it
the
pawnees
had
ten
head
of
horses
and
robes
and
blankets
saddles
bridles
shields
spears
and
moccasins
many
beautiful
presents
so
they
were
well
provided
the
head
chief
again
stood
up
and
talked
to
the
assembly
praising
these
pawnees
and
he
stepped
over
to
running
chief
and
shook
hands
with
him
and
when
he
did
so
running
chief
stood
up
and
put
his
arms
around
the
chief
and
pressed
him
to
his
breast
and
the
chief
did
the
same
to
him
and
when
running
chief
had
his
arms
around
the
chief
the
chief
trembled
and
came
near
to
crying
the
chief
embraced
the
other
pawnee
and
looked
him
in
the
face
and
said
what
brave
men
you
are
the
friend
said
what
my
friend
stepped
that
i
stepped
i
trod
in
his
footprints
i
had
one
mind
with
him
as
the
chief
stepped
back
to
his
place
he
spoke
through
the
interpreter
now
you
have
eaten
of
my
food
and
drunk
of
my
water
everything
that
i
have
is
yours
my
women
and
my
children
are
yours
you
are
not
a
chief
but
you
are
a
chief
then
he
spoke
to
the
crowd
and
they
all
went
away
leaving
only
the
principal
men
in
the
lodge
you
are
not
a
chief
but
you
have
made
yourself
a
chief
by
your
great
qualities
that
afternoon
the
pawnees
were
feasted
everywhere
and
had
to
eat
till
they
were
almost
dead
and
as
they
went
about
all
of
their
former
sadness
seemed
to
be
swept
away
and
running
chief
felt
like
crying
for
joy
while
they
were
feasting
the
man
who
had
given
the
black
horse
went
out
and
caught
it
up
and
painted
it
handsomely
and
rode
into
the
village
and
put
on
it
a
silver
bridle
and
eagle
feathers
in
its
mane
and
tail
and
when
running
chief
was
going
from
one
lodge
to
another
he
met
him
and
jumped
off
the
horse
and
said
brother
ride
this
he
gave
him
also
a
shield
and
a
spear
these
pawnees
staid
two
months
with
the
wichitas
and
all
their
troubles
seemed
at
an
end
at
length
running
chief
called
a
council
of
the
chiefs
and
told
them
that
now
he
wished
to
make
ready
to
go
home
to
his
village
he
thanked
them
for
all
that
they
had
done
for
him
and
said
that
now
he
would
go
the
chiefs
said
it
is

are
glad
that
you
have
been
with
us
and
visited
us
take
the
good
news
back
to

them
that
we
are
one
people
though
long
separated
let
the
road
between
our
villages
be
made
white
let
it
no
more
show
any
spots
of
blood
running
chief
thanked
them
and
said
i
will
go
and
take
the
good
news
to
my
people
i
shall
show
them
the
presents
you
have
made
us
and
tell
them
how
well
we
have
been
treated
it
may
be
that
some
of
the
chiefs
of
my
tribe
will
wish
to
come
down
to
visit
you
as
i
have
done
the
head
chief
said
can
i
rely
on
your
words
that
i
shall
be
visited
running
chief
replied
you
can
rely
on
them
if
i
have
to
come
alone
to
visit
you
again
the
chief
got
up
and
put
his
arms
about
him
and
said
i
want
to
be
visited
let
there
be
no
more
war
between
us
we
are
brothers
let
us
always
be
brothers
then
they
gave
him
many
more
presents
and
packed
his
horses
and
six
braves
offered
to
go
with
him
through
the
cheyenne
country
they
went
through
in
the
night
running
chief
said
afterward
i
could
have
stolen
a
lot
of
horses
from
the
cheyennes
but
i
thought
i
will
be
coming
back
through
this
country
and
it
is
better
not
at
the
pawnee
village
these
two
young
men
had
been
mourned
by
their
relations
as
lost
or
dead
it
was
in
the
spring
march
when
they
reached
home
and
there
was
joy
in
the
tribe
when
they
came
in
with
the
presents
running
chief
was
praised
and
so
was
his
friend

been
brave
and
had
done
great
things

the
leadership
of
lone

the
wichitas
who
received
them
well
and
gave
them
many
horses
lone

was
not
satisfied
with
the
peace
that
he
had
made
with
the
wichitas
he
also
visited
the
kiowas
and
made
peace
and
was
given
by
them
eight
fine
horses

also
led
his
party
to
the
comanches

to
their

of
them

the
lodges

that
camp
there
was
not

hoof

night
and
all
next

herd
then
lone
chief
said
let

not
run
the
horses
any
longer
they
will
not
come
after
us
they
are
afoot
when
the
party
got
on
the
north
side
of
the
republican
on
the
table
lands
a
terrible
storm
of
snow
and
wind
came
upon
them
and
they
were
nearly
lost
for
three
days
and
three
nights
they
lay
in
the
storm

were
frozen

losing
toes
and
fingers
they
survived
however
and
brought
in
all
their
horses

a
notable

court

is
a
high
bluff
or

on

it

of
a

is

soft

of
moderate
extent
a
number
of
years
ago
a
war
party
of
skidi
who
were
camped
near
court
house
rock
were
surprised
by
a
party
of
sioux
there
were
many
of
them
and
they
drove
the
skidi
back
and
at
length
these
were
obliged
to
climb
the
steep
side
of
court
house
rock
the
sioux
dared
not
follow
them
up
on
to
the
rock
but
guarded
the
only
place
where
it
was
possible
to
come
down
and
camped
all
around
the
rock
below
to
starve
the
skidi
out
the
skidi
had
nothing
to
eat
nor
to
drink
and
suffered
terribly
from
hunger
and
still
more
from
thirst
the
leader
of
the
party
suffered
most
of
any
for
he
thought
that
he
would
surely
lose
all
his
men
he
felt
that
this
was
the
worst
of
all
he
must
not
only
die
but
must
also
be
disgraced
because
under
his
leadership
the
young
men
of
his
party
had
been
lost
he
used
to
go
off
at
night
apart
from
the
others
and
pray
to
for
help
for
some
way
to
save
his
party
one
night
while
he
was
praying
something
spoke
to
him
and
said
look
hard
for
a
place
where
you
may
get
down
from
this
rock
and
so
save
both
your
men
and
yourself
he
kept
on
praying
that
night
and
when
day
came
he
looked
all
along
the
edge
of
the
rock
for
a
place
where
it
might
be
possible
to
get
down
at
last
he
found
near
the
edge
of
the
cliff
a
point
of
the
soft
clay
rock
sticking
up
above
the
level
of
the
rest
the
side
of
the
rock
below
it
was
straight
up
and
down
and
smooth
at
night
he
took
his
knife
and
began
to
cut
about
the
base
of
this
point
of
rock
and
night
after
night
he
kept
at
this
until
he
had
cut
away
the
base
of
the
point
so
that
it
was
no
larger
around
than
a
man
body
then
he
secretly
took
all
the
lariats
that
the
party
had
and
tied
them
together
and
let
them
down
and
found
that
his
rope
was
long
enough
to
reach
the
ground
he
put
the
rope
around
the
point
and
made
a
loop
in
it
for
his
feet
and
slowly
let
himself
down
to
the
ground
he
got
there
safely
and
then
climbed
back
again
the
next
night
he
called
his
men
about
him
and
told
them
how
it
was
and
that
they
might
all
be
saved
then
he
ordered
the
youngest
and
least
important
man
of
the
party
to
let
himself
down
and
after
him
the
next
youngest
and
so
on
up
to
the
more
important
men
and
last
of
all
the
leader
turn
came
he
let
himself
down
and
they
all
crept
through
the
sioux
camp
and
escaped
they
never
knew
how
long
the
sioux
stayed
there
watching
the
rock
probably
until
they
thought
that
the
skidi
had
all
starved
to
death
wolves
in
the
night
in
the
year
little
warrior
with
a
chaui
boy
and
a
soldier
was
off
scouting
on
the
plains
east
of
the
mountains
they
saw
a
long
way
off
perhaps
twenty
miles
some
objects
that
seemed
to
be
moving
it
was
one
of
those
hot
dry
days
in
summer
when
all
the
air
is
quivering
and
all
things
are
distorted
by
the
mirage
they
watched
these
objects
through
their
glasses
for
a
long
time
they
seemed
to
move
and
quiver
and
they
could
not
tell
what
they
were
but
little
warrior
thought
they
were
mounted
men
they
seemed
to
be
traveling
in
the
same
direction
with
this
scouting
party
at
length
they
could
see
that
they
were
mounted
men
and
were
driving
some
loose
animals
when
night
came
the
two
pawnees
left
their
horses
with
the
soldier
and
started
on
foot
to
look
for
the
camp
of
the
strangers
and
to
find
out
who
they
were
they
formed
the
plan
to
make
themselves
look
like
coyotes
so
that
they
could
go
close
to
the
camp
each
took
from
under
his
saddle
a
white
sheet
which
when
the
time
came
they
would
tie
around
their
bodies
having
their
guns
inside
held
under
their
arms
and
their
pistols
in
their
belts
about
their
waists
it
was
a
bright
moonlight
night
the
moon
being
so
bright
that
it
made
it
hard
to
see
far
on
the
prairie
the
camp
was
found
in
a
little
hollow
and
was
occupied
by
seven
ute
indians
they
had
a
dog
with
them
the
pawnees
could
hear
them
talking
and
laughing
as
they
sat
about
the
big
fire
they
had
built
they
could
see
the
horses
too
the
men
put
on
their
white
sheets
and
getting
down
on
all
fours
prowled
about
like
wolves
gradually
drawing
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
camp
two
or
three
times
the
dog
smelt
them
and
barked
but
they
paid
no
attention
to
it
but
trotted
hither
and
thither
smelling
the
ground
and
sometimes
sitting
up
on
their
haunches
like
wolves
and
then
going
on
again
after
a
little
while
they
came
so
close
to
the
camp
that
they
could
see
that
the
horses
were
staked
out
and
that
there
were
some
mules
feeding
about
hobbled
one
of
the
utes
who
noticed
the
wolves
prowling
near
the
camp
got
his
gun
and
shot
at
the
chaui
boy
but
he
did
not
hit
him
the
boy
loped
off
and
joined
little
warrior
behind
a
hill
and
there
the
two
waited
little
warrior
said
to
his
companion
these
men
have
come
far
they
are
pretty
tired
wait
and
they
will
lie
down
and
go
to
sleep
presently
the
camp
quieted
down
and
the
utes
slept
the
pawnees
then
made
themselves
wolves
again
and
went
close
to
the
ute
camp
the
horses
were
staked
close
to
where
the
men
were
sleeping
but
the
mules
had
wandered
off
a
little
to
one
side
six
mules
were
together
and
one
was
by
itself
on
the
other
side
of
the
camp
little
warrior
went
around
the
camp
to
this
one
and
cut
its
hobbles
and
then
drove
it
slowly
toward
the
others
then
they
drove
the
whole
seven
quietly
away
from
the
camp
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
dog
they
could
very
likely
have
stolen
the
horses
too
and
left
the
utes
afoot
and
perhaps
they
might
have
been
able
to
kill
the
utes
they
drove
the
mules
about
two
miles
and
then
went
on
to
where
they
had
left
their
horses
they
found
the
soldier
nearly
frightened
to
death
he
said
he
did
not
like
to
be
left
by
himself
in
such
a
lonely
place
he
wanted
to
go
to
camp
they
told
him
they
were
going
to
return
and
get
those
mules
they
did
so
and
secured
them
and
drove
them
in
to
their
own
camp
which
they
reached
about
six
the
next
morning
it
was
learned
afterward
that
fourteen
mules
had
been
stolen
from
a
government
train
and
a
reward
of
had
been
offered
for
their
recovery
these
taken
by
the
two
pawnees
were
seven
of
the
stolen
animals
and
each
of
the
men
received
as
his
proportion
of
the
reward

when

from

if
a
man
goes
away
from
the
village
and
sits
or
stands
by
himself
on
the
top
of
a
hill
it
is
a
sign
that
he
wants
to
be
alone
perhaps
to
meditate
perhaps
to

no
one
speaks
to
him
or
goes

now
there
was
once
a
pawnee
boy
who
went
off
on
the
warpath
to
the
cheyenne
camp
in
some
way
he
had
obtained
a
cheyenne
blanket
this
pawnee
came
close
to
the
cheyenne
camp
and
hid
himself
there
to
wait
about
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
he
left
his
hiding
place
and
walked
to
the
top
of
the
hill
overlooking
the
village
he
had
his
cheyenne
blanket
wrapped
about
him
and
over
his
head
with
only
a
little
hole
for
his
eyes
he
stood
there
for
an
hour
or
two
looking
over
the
cheyenne
camp
they
were
coming
in
from
buffalo
hunting
and
some
were
leading
in
the
pack
horses
loaded
down
with
meat
a
man
came
along
riding
a
horse
packed
with
meat
and
leading
another
pack
horse
and
a
black
spotted
horse
that
was
his
running
horse
these
running
horses
are
ridden
only
on
the
chase
or
on
war
parties
and
are
well
cared
for
after
being
used
they
are
taken
down
to
the
river
and
are
washed
and
cleaned
with
care
when
the
boy
saw
this
spotted
horse
he
thought
to
himself
that
this
was
the
horse
that
he
would
take
when
the
man
who
was
leading
it
reached
his
lodge
he
dismounted
and
handed
the
ropes
to
his
women
and
went
inside
then
the
pawnee
made
up
his
mind
what
he
would
do
he
started
down
the
hill
into
the
village
and
walked
straight
to
this
lodge
where
the
women
were
unloading
the
meat
he
walked
up
to
them
reached
out
his
hand
and
took
the
ropes
of
the
spotted
horse
and
one
of
the
others
as
he
did
so
the
women
fell
back
probably
they
thought
that
this
was
some
one
of
the
relations
of
the
owner
who
was
going
to
take
the
running
horse
down
to
the
river
to
wash
it
the
pawnee
could
not
talk
cheyenne
but
as
he
turned
away
he
mumbled
something
as
if
speaking
in
a
low
voice
and
then
walked
down
toward
the
river
as
soon
as
he
had
gone
down
over
the
bank
and
was
out
of
sight
he
jumped
on
the
spotted
horse
and
rode
into
the
brush
and
pretty
soon
was
away
with
two
horses
stolen
out
of
the
cheyenne
camp

broad
daylight

the
they
have
counted
and
the
horses
they
have

the
glory
of
comanche
chief
and
of
lone
chief
depends
mainly
on
their
bravery
rather
than
on
the
fact
that
they
were
yet
there
should
be
room
among
these
stories
for
the
account
of
an
educated
pawnee
a
brave
who
by
his
wise
counsel
to
an
indian
of
a
hostile
tribe
saved
many
lives
both
of
indians
and
of
white
men
little
warrior
was
educated
at
a
western
college
but
has
shown
his
bravery
on
the
field
of
battle
and
has
sacrificed
a
scalp
to
in
the
year
at
the
time
of
the
ute
outbreak
after
major
thornburgh
command
had
been
annihilated
little
warrior
was
employed
as
a
scout
for
the
troops
on
the
headwaters
of
the
arkansas
river
he
was
one
day
scouting
in
advance
of
the
command
in
company
with
four
white
soldiers
and
four
indian
scouts
one
day
the
party
saw
far
off
on
the
prairie
an
indian
who
showed
a
white
flag
and
came
toward
them
when
he
had
come
near
to
them
the
soldiers
proposed
to
kill
him
and
report
that
he
was
a
ute
one
of
the
indians
that
they
were
looking
for
but
little
warrior
said
no
he
has
a
white
flag
up
and
it
may
be
that
he
is
carrying
a
dispatch
or
perhaps
he
is
a
white
man
disguised
as
an
indian
when
the
man
had
come
close
to
them
they
saw
that
he
was
dressed
like
a
comanche
he
did
not
have
the
bristling
fringe
of
hair
over
the
forehead
that
the
utes
wear
and
his
side
locks
were
unbraided
little
warrior
asked
him
by
signs
if
he
was
alone
to
which
he
replied
in
the
same
language
that
he
was
alone
then
little
warrior
inquired
who
he
was
the
stranger
made
the
sign
for
comanche
a
friendly
tribe
they
took
him
into
the
camp
and
after
a
while
little
warrior
began
to
talk
to
him
in
comanche
he
could
not
understand
a
word
of
it
then
the
pawnee
said
to
him
my
friend
you
are
a
ute
the
stranger
acknowledged
that
he
was
then
little
warrior
talked
to
him
and
gave
him
much
good
advice
he
said
my
friend
you
and
i
have
the
same
skin
and
what
i
tell
you
now
is
for
your
good
i
speak
to
you
as
a
friend
and
what
i
say
to
you
now
is
so
that
you
may
save
your
women
and
your
children
it
is
of
no
use
for
you
to
try
to
fight
the
white
people
i
have
been
among
them
and
i
know
how
many
they
are
they
are
like
the
grass
even
if
you
were
to
kill
a
hundred
it
would
be
nothing
it
would
be
like
burning
up
a
few
handfuls
of
prairie
grass
there
would
be
just
as
many
left
if
you
try
to
fight
them
they
will
hunt
you
like
a
ghost
wherever
you
go
they
will
follow
after
you
and
you
will
get
no
rest
the
soldiers
will
be
continually
on
your
tracks
even
if
you
were
to
go
up
on
top
of
a
high
mountain
where
there
was
nothing
but
rocks
and
where
no
one
else
could
come
the
soldiers
would
follow
you
and
get
around
you
and
wait
and
wait
even
for
fifty
years
they
would
have
plenty
to
eat
and
they
could
wait
until
after
you
were
dead
there
is
one
white
man
who
is
the
chief
of
all
this
country
and
what
he
says
must
be
done
it
is
no
use
to
fight
him
now
if
you
are
wise
you
will
go
out
and
get
all
your
people
and
bring
them
in
on
to
the
reservation
and
give
yourself
up
it
will
be
better
for
you
in
the
end
i
speak
to
you
as
a
friend
because
we
are
both
the
same
color
and
i
hope
that
you
will
listen
to
my
words
the
ute
said
my
friend
your
words
are
good
and
i
thank
you
for
the
friendly
advice
you
have
given
me
i
will
follow
it
and
will
agree
to
go
away
and
bring
in
my
people

how
do
you
make

promise

ute
said
by
raising
the
right
hand
to
one
above
little
warrior
said
that
is
the
custom
also
among
my
people
the
ute
raised
his
hand
and
made
the
promise
after
he
had
been
detained
two
or
three
weeks
he
was
allowed
to
go
and
about
a
month
afterward
he
brought
in
the
band
of
which
he
was
chief
and
surrendered
through
his
influence
afterward
the
whole
tribe
came
in
and
gave
themselves
up
he
was
grateful
to
little
warrior
for
what
he
had
done
for
him
and
told
him
that
if
he
ever
came
back
into
his
country
he
would
give
him
many
ponies
a
comanche
bundle
a
pawnee
boy
went
to
the
comanche
village
after
horses
at
night
he
went
into
the
camp
crept
to
the
door
of
a
lodge
and
took
a
horse
that
was
tied
there
it
was
bright
moonlight
and
as
he
was
cutting
the
rope
he
saw
hanging
before
the
lodge
a
handsome
shield
and
a
spear
which
he
took
there
was
also
a
bundle
hanging
there
he
took
this
down
opened
it
and
found
in
it
a
war
bonnet
beaded
moccasins
and
leggings
and
a
of
long
beads
he
dressed
himself
in
all
these
fine
things
mounted
the
horse
and
rode
away
the
dun
horse
i
many
years
ago
there
lived
in
the
pawnee
tribe
an
old
woman
and
her
grandson
a
boy
about
sixteen
years
old
these
people
had
no
relations
and
were
very
poor
they
were
so
poor
that
they
were
despised
by
the
rest
of
the
tribe
they
had
nothing
of
their
own
and
always
after
the
village
started
to
move
the
camp
from
one
place
to
another
these
two
would
stay
behind
the
rest
to
look
over
the
old
camp
and
pick
up
anything
that
the
other
indians
had
thrown
away
as
worn
out
or
useless
in
this
way
they
would
sometimes
get
pieces
of
robes
worn
out
moccasins
with
holes
in
them
and
bits
of
meat
now
it
happened
one
day
after
the
tribe
had
moved
away
from
the
camp
that
this
old
woman
and
her
boy
were
following
along
the
trail
behind
the
rest
when
they
came
to
a
miserable
old
worn
out
dun
horse
which
they
supposed
had
been
abandoned
by
some
indians
he
was
thin
and
exhausted
was
blind
of
one
eye
had
a
bad
sore
back
and
one
of
his
forelegs
was
very
much
swollen
in
fact
he
was
so
worthless
that
none
of
the
pawnees
had
been
willing
to
take
the
trouble
to
try
to
drive
him
along
with
them
but
when
the
old
woman
and
her
boy
came
along
the
boy
said
come
now
we
will
take
this
old
horse
for
we
can
make
him
carry
our
pack
so
the
old
woman
put
her
pack
on
the
horse
and
drove
him
along
but
he
limped
and
could
only
go
very
slowly
ii
the
tribe
moved
up
on
the
north
platte
until
they
came
to
court
house
rock
the
two
poor
indians
followed
them
and
camped
with
the
others
one
day
while
they
were
here
the
young
men
who
had
been
sent
out
to
look
for
buffalo
came
hurrying
into
camp
and
told
the
chiefs
that
a
large
herd
of
buffalo
were
near
and
that
among
them
was
a
spotted
calf
the
head
chief
of
the
pawnees
had
a
very
beautiful
daughter
and
when
he
heard
about
the
spotted
calf
he
ordered
his
old
crier
to
go
about
through
the
village
and
call
out
that
the
man
who
killed
the
spotted
calf
should
have
his
daughter
for
his
wife
for
a
spotted
robe
is
big
medicine
the
buffalo
were
feeding
about
four
miles
from
the
village
and
the
chiefs
decided
that
the
charge
should
be
made
from
there
in
this
way
the
man
who
had
the
fastest
horse
would
be
the
most
likely
to
kill
the
calf
then
all
the
warriors
and
the
young
men
picked
out
their
best
and
fastest
horses
and
made
ready
to
start
among
those
who
prepared
for
the
charge
was
the
poor
boy
on
the
old
dun
horse
but
when
they
saw
him
all
the
rich
young
braves
on
their
fast
horses
pointed
at
him
and
said
oh
see
there
is
the
horse
that
is
going
to
catch
the
spotted
calf
and
they
laughed
at
him
so
that
the
poor
boy
was
ashamed
and
rode
off
to
one
side
of
the
crowd
where
he
could
not
hear
their
jokes
and
laughter
when
he
had
ridden
off
some
little
way
the
horse
stopped
and
turned
his
head
round
and
spoke
to
the
boy
he
said
take
me
down
to
the
creek
and
plaster
me
all
over
with
mud
cover
my
head
and
neck
and
body
and
legs
when
the
boy
heard
the
horse
speak
he
was
afraid
but
he
did
as
he
was
told
then
the
horse
said
now
mount
but
do
not
ride
back
to
the
warriors
who
laugh
at
you
because
you
have
such
a
poor
horse
stay
right
here
until
the
word
is
given
to
charge
so
the
boy
stayed
there
and
presently
all
the
fine
horses
were
drawn
up
in
line
and
pranced
about
and
were
so
eager
to
go
that
their
riders
could
hardly
hold
them
in
and
at
last
the
old
crier
gave
the
word
go
then
the
pawnees
all
leaned
forward
on
their
horses
and
yelled
and
away
they
went
suddenly
away
off
to
the
right
was
seen
the
old
dun
horse
he
did
not
seem
to
run
he
seemed
to
sail
along
like
a
bird
he
passed
all
the
fastest
horses
and
in
a
moment
he
was
among
the
buffalo
first
he
picked
out
the
spotted
calf
and
charging
up
alongside
of
it
straight
flew
the
arrow
the
calf
fell
the
boy
drew
another
arrow
and
killed
a
fat
cow
that
was
running
by
then
he
dismounted
and
began
to
skin
the
calf
before
any
of
the
other
warriors
had
come
up
but
when
the
rider
got
off
the
old
dun
horse
how
changed
he
was
he
pranced
about
and
would
hardly
stand
still
near
the
dead
buffalo
his
back
was
all
right
again
his
legs
were
well
and
fine
and
both
his
eyes
were
clear
and
bright
the
boy
skinned
the
calf
and
the
cow
that
he
had
killed
and
then
he
packed
all
the
meat
on
the
horse
and
put
the
spotted
robe
on
top
of
the
load
and
started
back
to
the
camp
on
foot
leading
the
dun
horse
but
even
with
this
heavy
load
the
horse
pranced
all
the
time
and
was
scared
at
everything
he
saw
on
the
way
to
camp
one
of
the
rich
young
chiefs
of
the
tribe
rode
up
by
the
boy
and
offered
him
twelve
good
horses
for
the
spotted
robe
so
that
he
could
marry
the
head
beautiful
daughter
but
the
boy
laughed
at
him
and
would
not
sell
the
robe
now
while
the
boy
walked
to
the
camp
leading
the
dun
horse
most
of
the
warriors
rode
back
and
one
of
those
that
came
first
to
the
village
went
to
the
old
woman
and
said
to
her
your
grandson
has
killed
the
spotted
calf
and
the
old
woman
said
why
do
you
come
to
tell
me
this
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
to
make
fun
of
my
boy
because
he
is
poor
the
warrior
said
what
i
have
told
you
is
true
and
then
he
rode
away
after
a
little
while
another
brave
rode
up
to
the
old
woman
and
said
to
her
your
grandson
has
killed
the
spotted
calf
then
the
old
woman
began
to
cry
she
felt
so
badly
because
every
one
made
fun
of
her
boy
because
he
was
poor
pretty
soon
the
boy
came
along
leading
the
horse
up
to
the
lodge
where
he
and
his
grandmother
lived
it
was
a
little
lodge
just
big
enough
for
two
and
was
made
of
old
pieces
of
skin
that
the
old
woman
had
picked
up
and
was
tied
together
with
strings
of
rawhide
and
sinew
it
was
the
meanest
and
worst
lodge
in
the
village
when
the
old
woman
saw
her
boy
leading
the
dun
horse
with
the
load
of
meat
and
the
robes
on
it
she
was
very
much
surprised
the
boy
said
to
her
here
i
have
brought
you
plenty
of
meat
to
eat
and
here
is
a
robe
that
you
may
have
for
yourself
take
the
meat
off
the
horse
then
the
old
woman
laughed
for
her
heart
was
glad
but
when
she
went
to
take
the
meat
from
the
horse
back
he
snorted
and
jumped
about
and
acted
like
a
wild
horse
the
old
woman
looked
at
him
in
wonder
and
could
hardly
believe
that
it
was
the
same
horse
so
the
boy
had
to
take
off
the
meat
for
the
horse
would
not
let
the
old
woman
come
near
him
iii
that
night
the
horse
spoke
again
to
the
boy
and
said
the
sioux
are
coming
a
large
war
party
they
will
attack
the
village
and
you
will
have
a
great
battle
now
when
the
sioux
are
drawn
up
in
line
of
battle
and
are
all
ready
to
fight
you
jump
on
to
me
and
ride
as
hard
as
you
can
right
into
the
middle
of
the
sioux
and
up
to
their
head
chief
their
greatest
warrior
and
count
on
him
and
kill
him
and
then
ride
back
do
this
four
times
and
count
on
four
of
the
bravest
sioux
and
kill
them
but
do
go
again
if
you
go
the
fifth
time
may
be
you
will
be
killed
or
else
you
will
lose
me
remember
so
the
boy
promised
the
next
day
it
happened
as
the
horse
had
said
and
the
sioux
came
down
and
formed
a
line
of
battle
then
the
boy
took
his
bow
and
arrows
and
jumped
on
the
dun
horse
and
charged
into
the
midst
of
them
and
when
the
sioux
saw
that
he
was
going
to
strike
their
head
chief
they
all
shot
their
arrows
at
him
and
the
arrows
flew
so
thickly
across
each
other
that
the
sky
became
dark
but
none
of
them
hit
the
boy
and
he
counted
on
the
chief
and
killed
him
and
then
rode
back
after
that
he
charged
again
among
the
sioux
where
they
were
gathered
thickest
and
counted
on
their
bravest
warrior
and
killed
him
and
then
twice
more
until
he
had
gone
four
times
as
the
horse
had
told
him
but
the
sioux
and
the
pawnees
kept
on
fighting
and
the
boy
stood
around
and
watched
the
battle
and
at
last
he
said
to
himself
i
have
been
four
times
and
have
killed
four
sioux
and
i
am
all
right
i
am
not
hurt
anywhere
why
may
i
not
go
again
so
he
jumped
on
the
dun
horse
and
charged
again
but
when
he
got
among
the
sioux
one
sioux
warrior
drew
an
arrow
and
shot
the
arrow
struck
the
dun
horse
behind
the
forelegs
and
pierced
him
through
and
the
horse
fell
down
dead
but
the
boy
jumped
off
and
fought
his
way
through
the
sioux
and
ran
away
as
fast
as
he
could
to
the
pawnees
now
as
soon
as
the
horse
was
killed
the
sioux
said
to
each
other
this
horse
was
like
a
man
he
was
brave
he
was
not
like
a
horse
and
they
took
their
knives
and
hatchets
and
hacked
the
dun
horse
and
gashed
his
flesh
and
cut
him
into
small
pieces
the
pawnees
and
sioux
fought
all
day
long
but
toward
night
the
sioux
broke
and
fled
iv
the
boy
felt
very
badly
that
he
had
lost
his
horse
and
after
the
fight
was
over
he
went
out
from
the
village
to
where
it
had
taken
place
to
mourn
for
his
horse
he
went
to
the
spot
where
the
horse
lay
and
gathered
up
all
the
pieces
of
flesh
which
the
sioux
had
cut
off
and
the
legs
and
the
hoofs
and
put
them
all
together
in
a
pile
then
he
went
off
to
the
top
of
a
hill
near
by
and
sat
down
and
drew
his
robe
over
his
head
and
began
to
mourn
for
his
horse
as
he
sat
there
he
heard
a
great
wind
storm
coming
up
and
it
passed
over
him
with
a
loud
rushing
sound
and
after
the
wind
came
a
rain
the
boy
looked
down
from
where
he
sat
to
the
pile
of
flesh
and
bones
which
was
all
that
was
left
of
his
horse
and
he
could
just
see
it
through
the
rain
and
the
rain
passed
by
and
his
heart
was
very
heavy
and
he
kept
on
mourning
and
pretty
soon
came
another
rushing
wind
and
after
it
a
rain
and
as
he
looked
through
the
driving
rain
toward
the
spot
where
the
pieces
lay
he
thought
that
they
seemed
to
come
together
and
take
shape
and
that
the
pile
looked
like
a
horse
lying
down
but
he
could
not
see
well
for
the
thick
rain
after
this
came
a
third
storm
like
the
others
and
now
when
he
looked
toward
the
horse
he
thought
he
saw
its
tail
move
from
side
to
side
two
or
three
times
and
that
it
lifted
its
head
from
the
ground
the
boy
was
afraid
and
wanted
to
run
away
but
he
stayed
and
as
he
waited
there
came
another
storm
and
while
the
rain
fell
looking
through
the
rain
the
boy
saw
the
horse
raise
himself
up
on
his
forelegs
and
look
about
then
the
dun
horse
stood
up
the
boy
left
the
place
where
he
had
been
sitting
on
the
hilltop
and
went
down
to
him
when
the
boy
had
come
near
to
him
the
horse
spoke
and
said
you
have
seen
how
it
has
been
this
day
and
from
this
you
may
know
how
it
will
be
after
this
but
has
been
good
and
has
let
me
come
back
to
you
after
this
do
what
i
tell
you
not
any
more
not
any
less
then
the
horse
said
now
lead
me
off
far
away
from
the
camp
behind
that
big
hill
and
leave
me
there
and
in
the
morning
come
for
me
and
the
boy
did
as
he
was
told
and
when
he
went
for
the
horse
in
the
morning
he
found
with
him
a
beautiful
white
gelding
much
more
handsome
than
any
horse
in
the
tribe
that
night
the
dun
horse
told
the
boy
to
take
him
again
to
the
place
behind
the
big
hill
and
to
come
for
him
the
next
morning
and
when
the
boy
went
for
him
again
he
found
with
him
a
beautiful
black
gelding
and
so
for
ten
nights
he
left
the
horse
among
the
hills
and
each
morning
he
found
a
different
colored
horse
a
bay
a
roan
a
gray
a
blue
a
spotted
horse
and
all
of
them
finer
than
any
horses
that
the
pawnees
had
ever
had
in
their
tribe
before
now
the
boy
was
rich
and
he
married
the
beautiful
daughter
of
the
head
chief
and
when
he
became
older
he
was
made
head
chief
himself
he
had
many
children
by
his
beautiful
wife
and
one
day
when
his
oldest
boy
died
he
wrapped
him
in
the
spotted
calf
robe
and
buried
him
in
it
he
always
took
good
care
of
his
old
grandmother
and
kept
her
in
his
own
lodge
until
she
died
the
dun
horse
was
never
ridden
except
at
feasts
and
when
they
were
going
to
have
a
doctors
dance
but
he
was
always
led
about
with
the
chief
wherever
he
went
the
horse
lived
in
the
village
for
many
years
until
he
became
very
old
and
at
last
he
died
a
story
of
faith
long
ago
before
they
ever
had
any
of
these
doctors
dances
there
was
in
the
tribe
a
young
boy
small
growing
up
he
seemed
not
to
go
with
the
other
boys
nor
to
play
with
them
but
would
keep
away
from
them
he
would
go
off
by
himself
and
lie
down
and
sometimes
they
would
find
him
crying
or
half
crying
he
seemed
to
have
peculiar
ways
his
father
and
mother
did
not
try
to
interfere
with
him
but
let
him
alone
sometimes
they
would
find
him
with
mud
or
clay
smeared
over
his
face
and
head
that
is
the
sign
of
a
doctor
when
you
see
a
person
putting
mud
on
his
face
or
head
it
shows
that
he
has
faith
in
the
earth
from
the
earth
are
taken
the
roots
that
they
use
in
medicine
when
the
parents
saw
this
they
did
not
understand
it
how
should
he
know
anything
about
mud
being
the
sign
of
a
doctor
they
did
not
understand
but
they
just
let
him
do
it
the
boy
grew
up
till
he
came
to
have
the
ways
of
a
young
man
but
he
never
went
with
any
of
the
other
boys
after
he
had
grown
up
they
saw
that
he
had
something
in
his
mind
sometimes
he
would
fast
for
two
days
and
sit
by
himself
smoking
and
praying
to
and
not
saying
anything
to
any
one
his
father
was
a
brave
but
not
a
chief
and
had
plenty
of
horses
the
son
was
well
dressed
and
comfortably
off
when
any
one
in
the
camp
was
sick
this
young
man
would
take
pity
on
him
and
of
his
own
accord
would
go
and
doctor
him
and
pretty
soon
the
person
would
be
well
again
through
his
doing
this
the
people
began
to
hear
about
him
and
his
name
became
great
he
was
humble
and
did
not
want
to
be
thought
well
of
he
was
not
proud
but
he
was
always
doing
good
at
that
time
there
were
many
doctors
in
the
tribe
and
they
wondered
how
it
was
that
he
could
cure
so
many
people
when
he
had
never
been
taught
by
any
of
them
they
could
not
understand
it
and
they
began
to
be
jealous
of
him
he
never
wanted
to
be
with
the
doctors
but
liked
to
stay
by
himself
he
wanted
to
be
alone
rather
than
with
any
one
in
that
time
there
were
bad
doctors
and
they
began
to
hear
about
this
humble
man
and
to
be
jealous
of
him
these
bad
doctors
could
curse
a
man
and
he
would
be
cursed
and
could
poison
one
they
had
great
power
and
influence
for
everybody
feared
them
the
bands
of
the
pawnees
were
not
then
together
as
they
are
now
as
the
people
talked
about
this
young
man
one
of
the
other
bands
heard
about
him
in
this
band
was
a
great
doctor
and
this
doctor
thought
to
himself
this
young
man
influence
is
growing
if
i
do
not
do
something
he
will
soon
be
ahead
of
me
this
great
doctor
went
to
the
village
to
visit
this
young
man
to
see
how
he
looked
and
to
find
out
how
he
got
his
knowledge
and
his
power
for
he
knew
he
had
never
been
taught
he
wanted
to
eat
with
him
and
talk
with
him
and
find
out
whence
his
learning
came
he
reached
the
village
he
was
welcomed
and
the
young
man
treated
him
with
respect
and
asked
him
to
come
into
the
lodge
and
sit
down
with
him
at
night
they
talked
together
the
great
doctor
said
i
am
glad
to
see
you
you
can
come
to
me
for
advice
sometimes
the
young
man
thanked
him
they
smoked
together
it
is
the
custom
always
when
an
indian
is
visiting
another
for
the
one
that
is
being
visited
to
present
all
the
smokes
but
at
this
time
the
great
doctor
said
we
will
smoke
my
tobacco
so
all
night
they
smoked
his
tobacco
the
next
morning
he
went
away
he
did
not
again
eat
with
the
young
man
he
said
i
am
glad
and
i
am
going
and
he
went
away
to
his
village
this
happened
in
the
winter
this
young
man
was
not
married
his
father
had
asked
him
to
marry
but
he
would
not
he
said
he
had
reasons
about
summer
time
he
felt
different
from
what
he
had
he
was
drowsy
and
felt
badly
he
felt
heavy
he
seemed
to
be
swelling
up
with
some
strange
new
disease
the
great
doctor
had
poisoned
him
with
this
result
how
it
was
no
one
can
tell
but
it
was
so
this
was
a
disgrace
and
he
did
not
know
how
to
get
out
of
it
there
was
no
way
he
would
go
off
and
cry
and
pray
to
and
sometimes
would
stay
for
three
or
four
days
without
anything
to
eat
he
was
so
miserable
that
one
time
he
was
going
to
kill
himself
he
did
not
tell
his
father
or
any
one
about
this
but
kept
it
to
himself
the
tribe
went
off
on
a
hunt
and
left
the
old
village
before
they
started
the
man
went
off
on
a
hill
somewhere
to
meditate
and
pray
and
his
father
told
him
that
when
he
was
ready
to
start
he
should
ride
such
a
horse
and
he
left
it
in
the
village
for
him
when
he
should
come
in
when
he
came
into
the
empty
village
he
found
the
horse
tied
there
and
he
saddled
it
and
started
but
instead
of
going
in
the
direction
the
tribe
had
taken
he
went
east
his
horse
was
a
fine
one
he
went
away
off
by
himself
for
some
days
and
at
last
he
stopped
and
got
off
his
horse
and
tied
it
to
a
tree
then
he
called
aloud
and
said
my
father
in
all
places
it
is
through
you
that
i
am
living
perhaps
it
was
through
you
that
this
man
put
me
in
this
condition
you
are
the
ruler
nothing
is
impossible
to
you
if
you
see
fit
take
this
away
from
me
then
he
turned
round
and
said
now
you
all
fish
of
the
rivers
and
you
all
birds
of
the
air
and
all
animals
that
move
upon
the
earth
and
you
oh
sun
i
present
to
you
this
animal
he
said
again
you
birds
in
the
air
and
you
animals
upon
the
earth
we
are
related
we
are
alike
in
this
respect
that
one
ruler
made
us
all
you
see
me
how
unhappy
i
am
if
you
have
any
power
intercede
for
me
when
he
had
finished
his
prayer
he
went
up
to
the
horse
and
stabbed
it
with
his
knife
and
killed
it
and
it
fell
down
dead
he
turned
it
so
that
its
head
was
toward
the
east
and
raised
it
on
its
belly
doubling
its
knees
under
it
and
cut
the
hide
down
the
back
and
skinned
it
down
on
both
sides
so
that
the
birds
of
the
air
and
the
animals
of
the
earth
might
feed
on
it
the
tribe
at
this
time
was
camped
on
the
head
of
the
republican
river
he
went
on
toward
the
east
until
he
came
to
the
place
on
the
platte
river
called
hill
island
he
saw
that
there
were
many
wild
animals
on
this
point
and
he
liked
it
and
thought
he
would
stay
there
and
perhaps
dream
he
stopped
there
a
while
feeling
very
badly
and
mourning
all
the
time
on
this
point
he
was
there
several
days
and
one
night
it
happened
that
he
went
to
sleep
fainted
for
he
was
exhausted
with
much
weeping
and
praying
something
spoke
to
him
and
said
what
are
you
doing
here
he
woke
up
and
looked
around
but
saw
no
one
it
was
only
a
voice
another
night
when
he
was
asleep
a
voice
asked
him
what
are
you
doing
here
he
awoke
and
looked
about
but
saw
no
one
a
third
night
the
same
thing
happened
and
he
was
wondering
what
it
meant
then
he
answered
and
said
who
ever
you
are
who
speaks
to
me
look
at
me
and
you
will
see
that
i
am
poor
in
mind
i
am
a
man
and
yet
i
am
in
a
condition
that
no
man
was
ever
in
before
i
am
here
only
to
suffer
and
to
die
whoever
you
are
who
speaks
to
me
take
pity
on
me
and
help
me
he
received
no
answer
poor
in
mind
despondent
miserable
unhappy
the
fourth
night
something
touched
him
he
was
half
awake
when
he
felt
it
something
said
what
are
you
doing
here
he
was
lying
on
his
side
his
head
toward
the
east
and
his
feet
toward
the
west
something
tapped
him
on
the
shoulder
and
he
looked
up
and
saw
a
great
big
animal
big
black
eyes
and
a
whitish
body
big
elk
when
he
looked
at
it
the
animal
said
get
up
and
sit
down
and
the
elk
too
sat
down
the
elk
said
i
have
heard
of
you
and
of
your
condition
and
i
am
here
to
tell
you
that
we
all
know
your
trouble
right
here
where
you
are
under
you
is
the
home
of
the
animals
i
know
that
it
is
impossible
to
help
you
but
i
shall
let
them
know
they
already
know
that
you
are
here
i
can
only
help
you
so
far
as
to
take
you
to
the
places
where
these
animals
are
if
this
animal
home
can
not
help
you
i
will
take
you
to
another
place
if
that
fails
i
will
take
you
to
another
place
if
that
fails
to
another
then
you
will
see
that
i
have
done
my
part
if
it
is
impossible
for
the
animals
to
do
it
we
have
still
one
above
that
we
look
to
as
soon
as
he
had
said
this
he
vanished
like
a
wind
disappeared
all
at
once
while
the
boy
sat
there
thinking
about
what
the
animal
had
said
to
him
he
fell
asleep
with
his
mind
full
of
these
things
in
his
sleep
something
talked
to
him
it
said
i
know
that
you
feel
badly
and
that
your
mind
is
poor
i
have
passed
you
many
times
and
i
have
heard
you
crying
i
belong
here
but
i
am
one
of
the
servants
i
have
informed
my
leaders
those
who
command
me
about
you
and
that
you
are
so
poor
in
your
mind
and
they
have
said
to
me
you
take
pity
on
him
do
as
you
please
because
you
are
our
servant
at
this
time
he
woke
up
and
saw
sitting
by
him
a
little
bird
he
talked
to
it
he
said
oh
my
brother
i
feel
pleased
that
you
understand
my
poor
mind
now
take
pity
on
me
and
help
me
the
bird
said
to
him
you
must
not
talk
in
this
way
to
me
i
am
only
a
servant
night
i
will
come
this
way
and
will
show
you
what
to
do
night
i
will
come
this
way
and
whatever
you
see
me
do
you
do
the
same
thing
then
he
disappeared
the
man
then
felt
a
little
easier
in
his
mind
and
more
as
if
there
were
some
hope
for
him
this
is
a
small
bird
blue
above
white
below
with
red
legs
it
is
and
sometimes
dives
down
into
the
water
it
is
the
messenger
bird
of
the
see
also
story
of
the
boy
who
was
sacrificed
the
next
night
the
bird
came
and
was
flying
about
near
him
after
dark
waiting
for
the
time
when
the
time
came
the
bird
flew
close
to
him
and
said
come
let
us
go
to
the
edge
of
the
cut
bank
when
they
had
come
to
the
edge
of
the
bank
above
the
water
in
the
river
the
bird
said
now
my
friend
you
are
poor
what
i
do
you
do
when
i
dive
down
off
this
bank
you
follow
me
the
man
replied
to
him
yes
i
am
poor
whatever
you
tell
me
to
do
i
will
do
so
when
the
bird
dived
down
off
the
cut
bank
the
man
threw
off
everything
and
cared
nothing
for
what
he
did
except
to
follow
the
bird
he
leaped
down
after
it
and
as
he
sprang
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
felt
like
a
bird
and
could
sail
this
way
and
that
he
did
not
feel
as
if
he
were
falling
and
were
going
to
be
hurt
but
as
if
he
were
flying
and
could
control
his
movements
just
as
he
reached
the
water
in
his
fall
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
standing
in
the
entrance
way
of
a
lodge
and
could
look
through
into
it
and
see
the
fire
burning
in
the
middle
while
he
was
standing
there
the
bird
flew
in
ahead
of
him
and
he
heard
it
say
here
he
is
he
stepped
toward
the
entrance
and
just
as
he
came
to
it
the
all
made
their
different
noises
for
they
are
not
used
to
the
smell
of
human
beings
the
bears
growled
and
the
panthers
and
wild
cats
and
wolves
and
rattlesnakes
and
other
animals
all
made
their
sounds
as
he
went
in
there
was
a
bear
standing
on
one
side
and
a
great
snake
on
the
other
and
it
was
very
difficult
for
the
man
to
go
in
he
hesitated
a
little
to
enter
that
narrow
passage
but
something
behind
him
seemed
to
push
him
ahead
although
the
bear
stood
ready
to
seize
him
and
the
snake
was
rattling
and
standing
up
as
if
about
to
strike
if
he
had
not
had
the
courage
to
pass
them
he
would
have
been
lost
but
he
looked
neither
to
the
right
nor
to
the
left
but
walked
straight
ahead
past
them
as
soon
as
he
had
passed
them
they
both
sank
back
and
were
quiet
then
all
the
made
another
kind
of
a
noise
as
if
welcoming
him
the
bear
began
to
lie
down
and
the
snake
stretched
itself
out
again
as
he
went
in
he
just
stood
there
and
looked
around
he
saw
there
all
kinds
of
animals
the
head
doctor
was
a
white
beaver
very
large
there
was
another
a
garfish
another
an
otter
and
the
fourth
was
a
sandhill
crane
the
man
sat
down
and
he
looked
very
pitiful
then
for
a
while
everything
was
silent
then
the
servant
said
to
the
four
head
doctors
i
have
brought
this
man
here
i
have
taken
pity
on
him
and
i
want
you
to
take
pity
on
him
then
it
was
more
silent
than
ever
the
man
looked
about
him
and
saw
all
the
animals
and
saw
them
roll
their
eyes
around
at
him
presently
the
servant
got
up
and
stood
right
in
the
midst
the
head
doctors
sat
at
the
back
of
the
lodge
opposite
the
door
on
the
other
side
of
the
fire
the
bird
said
my
rulers
you
know
me
i
am
your
servant
and
i
am
always
obedient
to
your
commands
no
matter
what
you
tell
me
to
do
i
do
it
no
matter
how
long
the
journeys
you
send
me
on
i
go
many
nights
i
have
lost
sleep
because
of
carrying
out
your
commands
i
have
seen
this
man
many
times
and
i
am
weary
of
his
crying
as
i
fly
back
and
forth
now
i
want
you
to
take
pity
on
this
man
because
i
pity
him
look
on
this
man
and
pity
him
then
the
bird
went
to
the
young
man
and
took
from
him
his
pipe
which
was
filled
and
carried
it
round
and
stood
before
the
beaver
the
head
doctor
and
held
out
the
pipe
to
him
to
take
the
white
beaver
did
not
stretch
out
his
hand
for
it
and
the
bird
stood
there
for
a
long
time
at
last
the
bird
began
to
cry
and
the
tears
began
to
run
down
its
face
and
it
cried
hard
and
at
last
the
white
beaver
stretched
out
his
hand
and
then
drew
it
back
again
and
hesitated
and
the
bird
kept
on
crying
and
at
length
the
head
doctor
reached
out
his
hand
and
took
the
pipe
just
as
soon
as
he
took
the
pipe
all
the
animals
made
a
kind
of
a
hissing
sound
as
much
as
to
say
good
they
were
pleased
then
the
white
beaver
holding
the
pipe
said
i
can
not
help
but
reach
out
for
this
pipe
for
i
take
pity
on
my
servant
but
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
promise
that
i
will
do
this
thing
but
i
will
do
what
i
can
i
will
leave
it
to
this
other
to
say
what
shall
be
done
and
he
passed
the
pipe
to
the
other
who
sat
next
to
him
this
animal
reached
for
the
pipe
and
took
it
he
made
a
speech
and
said
my
friends
i
am
poor
i
am
poor
i
have
not
such
power
as
that
and
he
passed
the
pipe
to
another
and
he
said
i
have
not
the
power
and
he
passed
it
to
another
and
so
it
went
around
the
circle
the
pipe
had
passed
around
and
none
of
the
had
the
power
none
of
them
seemed
to
understand
how
to
help
the
man
then
the
white
beaver
said
my
friend
you
see
that
no
one
of
us
have
the
power
to
help
you
there
is
another
lodge
of
at
you
must
go
there
and
ask
them
then
the
made
medicine
and
the
young
man
went
to
sleep
and
when
he
awoke
at
daylight
he
found
himself
on
the
point
where
he
had
lain
down
to
sleep
the
night
before
he
was
discouraged
and
wept
all
day
long
at
night
the
elk
came
to
him
and
said
go
to
sleep
i
will
take
you
over
to
the
man
slept
and
the
elk
took
him
on
its
back
and
carried
him
while
asleep
and
the
next
morning
he
found
himself
on
that
point
of
that
night
the
messenger
bird
came
to
him
and
said
now
my
friend
follow
me
and
what
you
see
me
do
that
do
yourself
when
i
dive
down
into
you
follow
me
the
bird
dived
down
into
the
spring
and
the
young
man
jumped
after
him
and
again
found
himself
standing
at
the
door
of
a
lodge
and
the
same
things
took
place
as
before
here
the
same
animals
were
the
head
doctors
the
chief
head
doctor
talked
to
the
boy
and
said
my
friend
i
am
sorry
you
have
come
to
me
in
the
condition
you
are
in
my
friend
this
is
something
impossible
if
it
were
anything
else
it
might
be
possible
for
us
to
cure
your
trouble
nothing
like
it
was
ever
known
before
when
he
had
said
this
he
turned
to
the
and
said
now
you
shall
be
the
leaders
if
there
are
any
of
you
who
understand
things
like
this
if
any
of
you
can
take
the
lead
in
things
like
this
why
do
it
it
is
beyond
my
power
say
what
shall
be
done
any
of
you
my
mind
would
be
big
if
any
of
you
could
take
pity
on
this
poor
man
another
one
of
the
stood
up
and
spoke
my
brother
to
the
white
beaver
and
my
brother
to
the
young
man
do
not
feel
hard
at
me
this
is
beyond
my
power
i
can
not
do
anything
to
help
him
so
it
went
around
the
circle
every
one
saying
that
it
was
impossible
after
it
had
gone
round
the
head
doctor
again
stood
up
and
said
now
my
friend
you
can
see
that
it
is
impossible
to
cure
you
of
this
trouble
but
there
is
another
lodge
of
the
on
the
west
side
of
the
loup
river
you
go
there
then
they
put
him
to
sleep
and
when
he
awoke
next
morning
he
was
on
top
of
the
ground
near
that
night
the
elk
took
him
while
he
was
asleep
to
the
place
on
the
loup
the
next
night
he
was
sitting
on
the
ground
there
and
the
bird
came
to
him
and
he
followed
the
bird
down
over
the
bank
and
into
the
lodge
here
the
head
doctors
were
the
same
animals
and
they
made
speeches
as
had
been
done
at
the
other
places
and
as
before
it
was
left
to
the
assembly
and
all
agreed
that
it
was
beyond
their
power
then
the
white
beaver
directed
him
to
go
to
an
island
in
the
platte
near
the
lone
tree
where
there
was
another
lodge
of
the
the
elk
took
him
to
this
island
under
the
center
of
this
island
was
the
lodge
the
messenger
bird
was
with
him
and
went
into
the
lodge
and
asked
the
to
help
him
the
white
beaver
made
a
speech
and
said
my
friend
i
have
heard
the
condition
that
you
are
in
of
all
these
lodges
that
you
have
visited
that
lodge
at
is
the
head
i
want
you
to
go
back
there
and
tell
the
leaders
there
that
they
are
the
rulers
and
that
whatever
they
shall
do
will
be
right
and
will
be
agreed
to
by
the
other
lodges
they
must
help
you
if
they
can
if
they
can
not
do
it
no
one
can
when
the
elk
took
him
back
to
the
bird
again
conducted
him
into
the
lodge
he
had
left
his
pipe
here
when
he
entered
the
lodge
all
the
animals
made
a
hissing
sound
they
were
glad
to
see
him
again
the
man
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
lodge
and
spoke
he
said
now
you
animals
all
you
are
the
leaders
you
see
how
poor
my
mind
is
i
am
tired
of
the
long
journeys
you
have
sent
me
on
i
want
you
to
take
pity
on
me
the
white
beaver
stood
up
and
took
the
pipe
and
said
oh
my
brother
i
have
done
this
to
try
these
other
lodges
of
to
see
if
any
of
them
were
equal
to
me
that
was
the
reason
that
i
sent
you
around
to
all
these
other
lodges
to
see
if
any
of
them
would
be
willing
to
undertake
to
rid
you
of
your
burden
but
i
see
that
they
all
still
acknowledge
that
i
am
the
leader
now
i
have
here
an
animal
that
i
think
will
undertake
to
help
you
and
to
rid
you
of
your
trouble
saying
this
he
stepped
out
to
the
right
and
walked
past
some
of
the
until
he
came
to
a
certain
animal
a
ground
dog
and
held
out
the
pipe
to
it
there
were
twelve
of
these
animals
all
alike
small
with
round
faces
and
black
whiskers
sitting
on
their
haunches
he
held
out
the
pipe
to
the
head
one
of
these
twelve
when
the
white
beaver
reached
out
the
pipe
to
this
animal
he
did
not
take
it
he
hesitated
a
long
time
and
held
his
head
down
he
did
not
want
to
take
the
pipe
he
looked
around
the
lodge
and
at
the
man
and
drew
in
his
breath
at
last
he
reached
out
his
paws
and
took
the
pipe
and
as
he
did
so
all
the
made
a
noise
the
biggest
kind
of
a
noise
they
were
glad
then
the
head
ground
dog
got
up
and
said
now
doctors
i
have
accepted
this
pipe
on
account
of
our
servant
who
is
so
faithful
and
who
many
a
night
has
lost
sleep
on
account
of
our
commands
i
have
accepted
it
for
his
sake
it
is
impossible
to
do
this
thing
if
it
had
been
earlier
i
could
perhaps
have
done
it
even
now
i
will
try
and
if
i
fail
now
we
can
do
nothing
for
him
after
they
had
smoked
they
told
the
man
to
go
and
sit
down
opposite
the
entrance
to
the
lodge
between
the
head
doctors
and
the
fire
these
twelve
animals
stood
up
and
walked
back
and
forth
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
fire
from
him
facing
him
after
a
while
they
told
him
to
stand
up
the
head
ground
dog
now
asked
the
other
to
help
him
by
singing
and
they
all
sang
and
the
ground
dogs
danced
keeping
time
to
the
singing
and
moved
their
hands
up
and
down
and
made
their
jaws
go
as
if
eating
but
did
not
open
their
mouths
after
a
while
they
told
him
to
lie
down
with
his
head
toward
the
doctors
and
his
feet
toward
the
entrance
after
he
had
lain
down
they
began
to
move
and
went
round
the
lodge
toward
him
and
the
head
ground
dog
jumped
over
the
man
belly
and
as
he
jumped
over
him
he
was
seen
to
have
a
big
piece
of
flesh
in
his
mouth
and
was
eating
it
another
ground
dog
followed
him
and
another
and
each
one
ran
until
he
came
to
the
man
and
as
each
one
jumped
over
him
it
had
a
piece
of
flesh
in
its
mouth
eating
it
so
they
kept
going
until
they
had
eaten
all
the
swelling
the
young
man
was
unconscious
all
this
time
for
he
afterward
said
he
knew
nothing
of
what
had
happened
the
head
ground
dog
spoke
to
the
animals
and
said
now
you
have
seen
what
i
can
do
this
is
the
power
that
i
have
that
is
the
reason
i
am
afraid
to
be
out
on
the
prairie
because
when
i
get
hungry
i
would
kill
men
and
would
eat
them
my
appetite
would
overpower
me
and
i
do
not
want
to
do
these
things
i
want
to
be
friendly
this
is
the
reason
that
i
do
not
travel
around
on
top
of
the
ground
i
stay
hid
all
the
time
the
man
was
still
unconscious
and
the
head
ground
dog
said
now
i
do
not
understand
how
to
restore
this
man
i
leave
that
to
you
then
the
ground
dogs
went
back
to
their
places
and
sat
down
then
the
head
doctor
the
beaver
spoke
to
the
bears
he
said
now
this
man
belongs
to
you
let
me
see
what
you
can
do
the
head
bear
got
up
and
said
very
well
i
will
come
i
will
let
you
see
what
i
can
do
then
the
bears
stood
up
and
began
to
sing
the
head
bear
would
jump
on
top
of
the
man
and
act
as
if
he
were
going
to
tear
him
to
pieces
and
the
others
would
take
hold
of
him
and
shake
him
around
and
at
last
his
blood
began
to
flow
and
the
man
began
to
breathe
but
he
was
still
unconscious
after
a
while
he
moved
and
came
to
life
and
felt
himself
just
as
he
had
been
many
months
before
he
found
that
his
trouble
was
gone
and
that
he
was
cured
the
head
bear
still
stood
by
him
and
spoke
to
the
he
said
now
this
is
what
i
can
do
i
do
not
care
how
dangerously
wounded
i
may
be
i
know
how
to
cure
myself
if
they
leave
any
breath
at
all
in
me
i
know
how
to
cure
myself
then
the
bears
went
to
their
place
and
sat
down
the
man
got
up
and
spoke
to
the
thanking
them
for
what
they
had
done
for
him
he
stayed
there
several
nights
watching
the
doings
of
the
they
taught
him
all
their
ways
all
the
animal
secrets
the
head
doctor
said
to
him
now
i
am
going
to
send
you
back
to
your
home
but
i
will
ask
a
favor
of
you
in
return
for
what
i
have
done
for
you
the
man
answered
him
it
will
be
so
whatever
you
say
the
doctor
said
through
you
let
my
animals
that
move
in
the
river
be
fed
now
you
can
see
who
we
are
i
move
in
the
water
i
have
no
breath
but
i
exist
we
every
one
of
us
shall
die
except
he
made
us
just
as
he
made
you
he
made
you
to
live
in
the
air
we
live
where
there
is
no
air
you
see
the
difference
i
know
where
is
that
great
water
that
surrounds
us
the
ocean
i
know
that
the
heaven
sky
is
the
house
of
and
we
live
inside
of
it
you
must
imitate
us
do
as
we
do
you
must
place
your
dependence
on
us
but
still
if
anything
comes
up
that
is
very
difficult
you
must
put
your
dependence
on
ask
help
from
the
ruler
he
made
us
he
made
every
thing
there
are
different
ways
to
different
creatures
what
you
do
i
do
not
do
and
what
i
do
you
do
not
do
we
are
different
when
you
imitate
us
you
must
always
blow
a
smoke
to
each
one
of
these
four
chief
doctors
once
to
each
but
to
you
must
blow
four
smokes
and
always
blow
four
to
the
night
to
the
east
because
something
may
tell
you
in
your
sleep
a
thing
which
will
happen
this
smoke
represents
the
air
filled
with
the
smoke
of
hazy
days
that
smoke
is
pleasant
to
he
made
it
himself
now
go
home
and
after
you
have
been
there
for
a
time
go
and
pay
a
visit
to
the
doctor
who
put
you
in
this
condition
the
young
man
went
home
to
his
village
and
got
there
in
the
night
he
had
long
been
mourned
as
dead
and
his
father
was
now
poor
in
mind
on
account
of
him
he
went
into
his
father
lodge
and
touched
him
and
said
wake
up
i
am
here
his
father
could
not
believe
it
he
had
thought
him
dead
a
long
time
he
said
is
it
you
or
is
it
a
ghost
the
young
man
answered
it
is
i
just
the
same
as
ever
get
up
and
go
and
tell
my
uncles
and
all
my
relations
that
i
am
here
i
want
you
to
give
me
something
a
blue
bead
and
some
indian
tobacco
and
some
buffalo
meat
and
a
pipe
the
father
went
about
and
told
his
relations
that
his
son
had
come
back
and
they
were
very
glad
and
came
into
the
lodge
bringing
the
presents
and
gave
them
to
the
boy
he
took
them
and
went
down
to
the
river
and
threw
them
in
and
they
were
carried
down
to
the
lodge
at
a
few
days
after
this
the
boy
got
on
his
horse
and
rode
away
to
visit
the
doctor
who
had
brought
his
trouble
on
him
when
he
reached
the
village
the
people
said
to
the
doctor
a
man
is
coming
to
visit
you
and
the
doctor
was
troubled
for
he
knew
what
he
had
done
to
the
boy
but
he
thought
that
he
knew
so
much
that
no
one
could
get
the
better
of
him
when
the
boy
came
to
the
lodge
he
got
off
his
horse
went
in
and
was
welcomed
after
they
had
eaten
the
boy
said
to
him
when
you
visited
me
we
smoked
your
tobacco
we
will
smoke
mine
they
did
so
for
the
doctor
thought
that
no
one
could
overcome
him
they
smoked
until
daylight
and
while
they
were
smoking
the
boy
kept
moving
his
jaws
as
if
eating
but
did
not
open
his
mouth
at
daylight
the
boy
said
he
must
be
going
he
went
and
when
he
got
down
to
the
river
he
blew
strongly
upon
the
ice
and
immediately
the
water
in
the
river
was
full
of
blood
it
was
the
blood
of
the
doctor
it
seems
that
the
ground
dogs
had
taught
the
young
man
how
to
do
their
things
when
the
people
found
the
doctor
he
was
dead
in
his
lodge
and
he
was
all
hollow
all
his
blood
and
the
inside
of
him
had
gone
into
the
river
and
had
gone
down
to
feed
the
animals
so
the
boy
kept
his
promise
to
the
and
had
revenge
on
the
doctor
the
boy
was
the
greatest
doctor
in
the
band
and
was
the
first
who
taught
them
all
the
doctors
ceremonies
that
they
have
he
taught
them
all
the
wonderful
things
that
the
doctors
can
do
and
many
other
things
illustration
knife
the
bear
man
there
was
once
a
young
boy
who
when
he
was
playing
with
his
fellows
used
often
to
imitate
the
ways
of
a
bear
and
to
pretend
that
he
was
one
the
boys
did
not
know
much
about
bears
they
only
knew
that
there
were
such
animals
now
it
had
happened
that
before
this
boy
was
born
his
mother
had
been
left
alone
at
home
for
his
father
had
gone
on
the
warpath
toward
the
enemy
and
this
was
about
five
or
six
months
before
the
babe
would
be
born
as
the
man
was
going
on
the
warpath
he
came
upon
a
little
bear
cub
very
small
whose
mother
had
gone
away
and
he
caught
it
he
did
not
want
to
kill
it
because
it
was
so
young
and
helpless
it
seemed
to
him
like
a
little
child
it
looked
up
to
him
and
cried
after
him
because
it
knew
no
better
and
he
hated
to
kill
it
or
to
leave
it
there
after
he
had
thought
about
this
for
a
while
he
put
a
string
around
its
neck
and
tied
some
medicine
smoking
stuff
indian
tobacco
to
it
and
said
child
you
are
a
made
you
and
takes
care
of
you
he
will
look
after
you
but
i
put
these
things
about
your
neck
to
show
that
i
have
good
feelings
toward
you
i
hope
that
when
my
child
is
born
the
will
take
care
of
him
and
see
that
he
grows
up
a
good
man
and
i
hope
that
will
take
care
of
you
and
of
mine
he
looked
at
the
little
bear
for
quite
a
long
time
and
talked
to
it
and
then
he
went
on
his
way
when
he
returned
to
the
village
from
his
warpath
he
told
his
wife
about
the
little
bear
and
how
he
had
looked
at
it
and
talked
to
it
when
his
child
was
born
it
had
all
the
ways
of
a
bear
so
it
is
among
the
pawnees
a
woman
before
her
child
is
born
must
not
look
hard
at
any
animal
for
the
child
may
be
like
it
there
was
a
woman
in
the
band
who
caught
a
rabbit
and
because
it
was
gentle
and
soft
she
took
it
up
in
her
hands
and
held
it
before
her
face
and
petted
it
and
when
her
child
was
born
it
had
a
split
nose
like
a
rabbit
this
man
is
still
alive
this
boy
who
was
like
a
bear
as
he
grew
up
had
still
more
the
ways
of
a
bear
often
he
would
go
off
by
himself
and
try
to
pray
to
the
bear
because
he
felt
like
a
bear
he
used
to
say
in
a
joking
way
to
the
other
young
men
that
he
could
make
himself
a
bear
after
he
had
come
to
be
a
man
he
started
out
once
on
the
warpath
with
a
party
of
about
others
he
was
the
leader
of
the
party
they
went
away
up
on
the
running
water
and
before
they
had
come
to
any
village
they
were
discovered
by
sioux
the
enemy
pursued
them
and
surrounded
them
and
fought
with
them
the
pawnees
were
overpowered
their
enemies
were
so
many
and
all
were
killed
the
country
where
this
took
place
is
rocky
and
much
cedar
grows
there
many
bears
lived
there
the
battle
was
fought
in
the
morning
and
the
pawnees
were
all
killed
in
a
hollow
right
after
the
fight
in
the
afternoon
two
bears
came
traveling
along
by
this
place
when
they
came
to
the
spot
where
the
pawnees
had
been
killed
they
found
one
of
the
bodies
and
the
she
bear
recognized
it
as
that
of
the
boy
who
was
like
a
bear
she
called
to
the
he
bear
and
said
here
is
the
man
that
was
very
good
to
us
he
often
sacrificed
smokes
to
us
and
every
time
he
ate
he
used
always
to
take
a
piece
of
food
and
give
it
to
us
saying
is
something
for
you
to
eat
eat
this
here
is
the
one
that
always
imitated
us
and
sung
about
us
and
talked
about
us
can
you
do
anything
for
him
the
he
bear
said
i
fear
i
can
not
do
it
i
have
not
the
power
but
i
will
try
i
can
do
anything
if
the
sun
is
shining
i
seem
to
have
more
power
when
the
sun
is
shining
on
me
that
day
it
was
cloudy
and
cold
and
snowing
every
now
and
then
the
clouds
would
pass
and
the
sun
come
out
for
a
little
while
and
then
the
clouds
would
cover
it
up
again
the
man
was
all
cut
up
pretty
nearly
hacked
in
small
pieces
for
he
was
the
bravest
of
all
the
two
bears
gathered
up
the
pieces
of
the
man
and
put
them
together
and
then
the
he
bear
lay
down
and
took
the
man
on
his
breast
and
the
she
bear
lay
on
top
of
it
to
warm
the
body
they
worked
over
it
with
their
medicine
and
every
now
and
then
the
he
bear
would
cry
out
and
say
father
help
me
i
wish
the
sun
was
shining
after
a
while
the
dead
body
grew
warm
and
then
began
to
breathe
a
little
it
was
still
all
cut
up
but
it
began
to
have
life
pretty
soon
the
man
began
to
move
and
to
come
to
life
and
then
he
became
conscious
and
had
life
when
he
came
to
himself
and
opened
his
eyes
he
was
in
the
presence
of
two
bears
the
he
bear
spoke
to
him
and
said
it
is
not
through
me
that
you
are
living
it
was
the
she
bear
who
asked
for
help
for
you
and
had
you
brought
back
to
life
now
you
are
not
yet
whole
and
well
you
must
come
away
with
us
and
live
with
us
for
a
time
until
all
your
wounds
are
healed
the
bears
took
him
away
with
them
but
the
man
was
very
weak
and
every
now
and
then
as
they
were
going
along
he
would
faint
and
fall
down
but
still
they
would
help
him
up
and
support
him
and
they
took
him
along
with
them
until
they
came
to
a
cave
in
the
rocks
among
the
cedars
which
was
their
home
when
he
entered
the
cave
he
found
there
their
young
ones
that
they
had
left
behind
when
they
started
out
the
man
was
all
cut
up
and
gashed
he
had
also
been
scalped
and
had
no
hair
on
his
head
he
lived
with
the
bears
until
he
was
quite
healed
of
his
wounds
and
also
had
come
to
understand
all
their
ways
the
two
old
bears
taught
him
everything
that
they
knew
the
he
bear
said
to
him
none
of
all
the
beings
and
animals
that
roam
over
the
country
are
as
great
and
as
wise
as
the
bears
no
animal
is
equal
to
us
when
we
get
hungry
we
go
out
and
kill
something
and
eat
it
i
did
not
make
the
wisdom
that
i
have
i
am
an
animal
and
i
look
to
one
above
he
made
me
and
he
made
me
to
be
great
i
am
made
to
live
here
and
to
be
great
but
still
there
will
be
an
end
to
my
days
just
as
with
all
of
us
that
has
created
upon
this
earth
i
am
going
to
make
you
a
great
man
but
you
must
not
deceive
yourself
you
must
not
think
that
i
am
great
or
can
do
great
things
of
myself
you
must
always
look
up
above
for
the
giver
of
all
power
you
shall
be
great
in
war
and
great
in
wealth
now
you
are
well
and
i
shall
take
you
back
to
your
home
and
after
this
i
want
you
to
imitate
us
this
shall
be
a
part
of
your
greatness
i
shall
look
after
you
i
shall
give
to
you
a
part
of
myself
if
i
am
killed
you
shall
be
killed
if
i
grow
old
you
shall
be
old
i
want
you
to
look
at
one
of
the
trees
that
made
in
this
earth
and
place
your
dependence
on
it
made
this
tree
pointing
to
a
cedar
it
never
gets
old
it
is
always
green
and
young
take
notice
of
this
tree
and
always
have
it
with
you
and
when
you
are
in
the
lodge
and
it
thunders
and
lightens
throw
some
of
it
on
the
fire
and
let
the
smoke
rise
hold
that
fast
a
cedar
is
never
struck
by
lightning
the
he
bear
took
the
skin
of
a
bear
and
made
a
cap
for
him
to
hide
his
naked
skull
his
wounds
were
now
all
healed
and
he
was
well
and
strong
the
man
people
had
nearly
forgotten
him
it
had
been
so
long
ago
and
they
had
supposed
that
the
whole
party
had
been
killed
soon
after
this
the
he
bear
said
now
we
will
take
that
journey
they
started
and
went
to
the
village
and
waited
near
it
till
it
was
night
then
the
bear
said
to
him
go
into
the
village
and
tell
your
father
that
you
are
here
then
get
for
me
a
piece
of
buffalo
meat
and
a
blue
bead
and
some
indian
tobacco
and
some
sweet
smelling
clay
a
green
clay
which
they
roast
and
which
then
turns
dark
red
and
has
a
sweet
smell
the
man
went
into
the
village
and
his
father
was
very
much
surprised
and
very
glad
to
see
him
again
he
got
the
presents
and
brought
them
to
the
bear
and
gave
them
to
him
and
the
bear
talked
to
him
when
they
were
about
to
part
the
bear
came
up
to
him
and
put
his
arms
about
him
and
hugged
him
and
put
his
mouth
against
the
mouth
and
said
as
the
fur
that
i
am
in
has
touched
you
it
will
make
you
great
and
this
will
be
a
blessing
to
you
his
paws
were
around
the
man
shoulders
and
he
drew
them
down
his
arms
until
they
came
to
his
hands
and
he
held
them
and
said
as
my
hands
have
touched
your
hands
they
are
made
great
not
to
fear
anything
i
have
rubbed
my
hands
down
over
you
so
that
you
shall
be
as
tough
as
i
am
because
my
mouth
has
touched
your
mouth
you
shall
be
made
wise
then
he
left
him
and
went
away
so
this
man
was
the
greatest
of
all
warriors
and
was
brave
he
was
like
a
bear
he
originated
the
bear
dance
which
still
exists
among
the
tribe
of
pawnees
he
came
to
be
an
old
man
and
at
last
died
of
old
age
i
suspect
the
old
bear
died
at
the
same
time
illustration
a
rattle
the
ghost
wife
one
time
there
were
living
together
a
man
and
his
wife
they
had
a
young
child
the
woman
died
the
man
was
very
sad
and
mourned
for
his
wife
one
night
he
took
the
child
in
his
arms
and
went
out
from
the
village
to
the
place
where
his
wife
was
buried
and
stood
over
the
grave
and
mourned
for
his
wife
the
little
child
was
very
helpless
and
cried
all
the
time
the
man
heart
was
sick
with
grief
and
loneliness
late
in
the
night
he
fell
asleep
fainting
and
worn
out
with
sorrow
after
a
while
he
awoke
and
when
he
looked
up
there
was
a
form
standing
by
him
the
form
standing
there
was
the
one
who
had
died
she
spoke
to
her
husband
and
said
you
are
very
unhappy
here
there
is
a
place
to
go
where
we
would
not
be
unhappy
where
i
have
been
nothing
bad
happens
to
one
here
you
never
know
what
evil
will
come
to
you
you
and
the
child
had
better
come
to
me
the
man
did
not
want
to
die
he
said
to
her
no
it
will
be
better
if
you
can
come
back
to
us
we
love
you
if
you
were
with
us
we
would
be
unhappy
no
longer
for
a
long
time
they
discussed
this
to
decide
which
one
should
go
to
the
other
at
length
the
man
by
his
persuasions
overcame
her
and
the
woman
agreed
to
come
back
she
said
to
the
man
if
i
am
to
come
back
you
must
do
exactly
as
i
tell
you
for
four
nights
for
four
days
the
curtain
must
remain
let
down
before
my
sleeping
place
it
must
not
be
raised
no
one
must
look
behind
it
the
man
did
as
he
had
been
told
and
after
four
days
had
passed
the
curtain
was
lifted
and
the
woman
came
out
from
behind
it
then
they
all
saw
her
first
her
relations
and
afterward
the
whole
tribe
her
husband
and
her
child
were
very
glad
and
they
lived
happily
together
a
long
time
after
this
the
man
took
another
wife
the
first
wife
was
always
pleasant
and
but
the
new
one
was
and
after
some
time
she
grew
jealous
of
the
first
woman
and
quarreled
with
her
at
length
one
day
the
last
married
became
angry
with
the
other
and
called
her
bad
names
and
finally
said
to
her
you
ought
not
to
be
here
you
are
nothing
but
a
ghost
anyway
that
night
when
the
man
went
to
bed
he
lay
down
as
was
his
custom
by
the
side
of
his
first
wife
during
the
night
he
awoke
and
found
that
his
wife
had
disappeared
she
was
seen
no
more
the
next
night
after
this
happened
the
man
and
the
child
both
died
in
sleep
the
wife
had
called
them
to
her
they
had
gone
to
that
place
where
there
is
a
living
this
convinced
everybody
that
there
is
a
hereafter
the
man
who
called
the
buffalo
this
happened
in
the
olden
time
before
we
had
met
the
white
people
then
the
different
bands
lived
in
separate
villages
the
lodges
were
made
of
dirt
the
band
went
off
on
a
winter
hunt
roaming
over
the
country
as
they
used
to
do
after
buffalo
at
this
time
they
did
not
find
the
buffalo
near
they
scouted
in
all
directions
but
could
discover
no
signs
of
them
it
was
a
hard
time
of
starvation
the
children
cried
and
the
women
cried
they
had
nothing
at
all
to
eat
there
was
a
person
who
looked
at
the
children
crying
for
something
to
eat
and
it
touched
his
heart
they
were
very
poor
and
he
felt
sorry
for
them
he
said
to
the
head
chief
tell
the
chiefs
and
other
head
men
to
do
what
i
tell
them
my
heart
is
sick
on
account
of
the
suffering
of
the
people
it
may
be
that
i
can
help
them
let
a
new
lodge
be
set
up
outside
the
village
for
us
to
meet
in
i
will
see
if
i
can
do
anything
to
relieve
the
tribe
the
chief
said
that
it
was
well
to
do
this
and
he
gave
orders
for
it
while
they
were
preparing
to
build
this
lodge
they
would
miss
this
man
in
the
night
he
would
disappear
like
a
wind
and
go
off
a
long
way
and
just
as
daylight
came
he
would
be
there
again
sometimes
while
sitting
in
his
own
lodge
during
the
day
he
would
reach
behind
him
and
bring
out
a
small
piece
of
buffalo
meat
fat
and
lean
and
would
give
it
to
some
one
saying
when
you
have
had
enough
save
what
is
left
and
give
it
to
some
one
else
when
he
would
give
this
small
piece
of
meat
to
any
one
the
person
would
think
this
is
not
enough
to
satisfy
my
hunger
but
after
eating
until
he
was
full
there
was
always
enough
left
to
give
to
some
other
person
in
those
days
it
was
the
custom
for
the
head
chief
of
the
tribe
once
in
a
while
to
mount
his
horse
and
ride
about
through
the
village
talking
to
the
people
and
giving
them
good
advice
and
telling
them
that
they
ought
to
do
what
was
right
by
each
other
at
this
time
the
chief
spoke
to
the
people
and
explained
that
this
man
was
going
to
try
to
benefit
the
tribe
so
the
people
made
him
many
fine
presents
otter
skins
and
eagle
feathers
and
when
they
gave
him
these
things
each
one
said
i
give
you
this
it
is
for
yourself
try
to
help
us
he
thanked
them
for
these
presents
and
when
they
were
all
gathered
together
he
said
now
you
chiefs
and
head
men
of
the
tribe
and
you
people
you
have
done
well
to
give
me
these
things
i
shall
give
them
to
that
person
who
gives
me
that
power
and
who
has
taken
pity
on
me
i
shall
let
you
starve
yet
four
days
then
help
will
come
during
these
four
days
every
day
and
night
he
disappeared
but
would
come
back
the
same
night
he
would
say
to
the
people
that
he
had
been
far
off
where
it
would
take
a
person
three
or
four
days
to
go
but
he
was
always
back
the
same
night
when
he
got
back
on
the
fourth
night
he
told
the
people
that
the
buffalo
were
near
that
the
next
morning
they
would
be
but
a
little
way
off
he
went
up
on
the
hill
near
the
camp
and
sacrificed
some
eagle
feathers
and
some
blue
beads
and
some
indian
tobacco
and
then
returned
to
the
camp
then
he
said
to
the
people
when
that
object
comes
to
that
place
of
sacrifice
do
not
interfere
with
it
do
not
turn
it
back
let
it
go
by
just
watch
and
see
the
next
morning
at
daylight
all
the
people
came
out
of
their
lodges
to
watch
this
hill
and
the
place
where
he
had
sacrificed
while
they
were
looking
they
saw
a
great
buffalo
bull
come
up
over
the
hill
to
the
place
he
stood
there
for
a
short
time
and
looked
about
and
then
he
walked
on
down
the
hill
and
went
galloping
off
past
the
village
then
this
man
spoke
to
the
people
and
said
there
that
is
what
i
meant
that
is
the
leader
of
the
buffalo
where
he
went
the
whole
herd
will
follow
he
sent
his
servant
to
the
chiefs
to
tell
them
to
choose
four
boys
and
let
them
go
to
the
top
of
the
hill
where
the
bull
had
come
over
and
to
look
beyond
it
the
boys
were
sent
and
ran
to
the
top
of
the
hill
and
when
they
looked
over
beyond
it
they
stopped
and
then
turned
and
came
back
running
they
went
to
the
chiefs
lodge
and
said
to
the
chiefs
sitting
there
beyond
that
place
of
sacrifice
there
is
coming
a
whole
herd
of
buffalo
many
many
crowding
and
pushing
each
other
then
as
it
used
to
be
in
the
old
times
as
soon
as
the
young
men
had
told
the
chief
that
the
buffalo
were
coming
the
chief
rode
about
the
village
and
told
every
one
to
get
ready
to
chase
them
he
said
to
them
besides
do
not
leave
anything
on
the
killing
ground
bring
into
the
camp
not
only
the
meat
and
hides
but
the
heads
and
legs
and
all
parts
bring
the
best
portions
in
first
and
take
them
over
to
the
new
lodge
so
that
we
may
have
a
feast
there
for
so
the
man
had
directed
presently
the
buffalo
came
over
the
hill
and
the
people
were
ready
and
they
made
a
surround
and
killed
all
that
they
could
and
brought
them
home
each
man
brought
in
his
ribs
and
his
young
buffalo
and
left
them
there
at
that
lodge
the
other
parts
they
brought
into
the
village
as
he
had
directed
after
they
had
brought
in
this
meat
they
went
to
the
lodge
and
staid
there
four
days
and
four
nights
and
had
a
great
feast
roasting
these
ribs
the
man
told
them
that
they
would
make
four
surrounds
like
this
and
to
get
all
the
meat
that
they
could
but
he
said
in
surrounding
these
buffalo
you
must
see
that
all
the
meat
is
saved
does
not
like
the
people
to
waste
the
buffalo
and
for
that
reason
i
advise
you
to
make
good
use
of
all
you
kill
during
the
four
nights
they
feasted
this
man
used
to
disappear
each
night
on
the
night
of
the
fourth
day
he
said
to
the
people
the
buffalo
will
come
again
and
you
will
make
another
surround
be
careful
not
to
kill
a
yellow
calf
a
little
one
that
you
will
see
with
the
herd
nor
its
mother
this
was
in
winter
and
yet
the
calf
was
the
same
color
as
a
young
calf
born
in
the
spring
they
made
the
surround
and
let
the
yellow
calf
and
its
mother
go
a
good
many
men
in
the
tribe
saw
that
this
man
was
great
and
that
he
had
done
great
things
for
the
tribe
and
they
made
him
many
presents
the
best
horses
that
they
had
he
thanked
them
but
he
did
not
want
to
accept
the
presents
the
tribe
believed
that
he
had
done
this
wonderful
thing
had
brought
them
buffalo
and
all
the
people
wanted
to
do
just
what
he
told
them
to
in
the
first
two
surrounds
they
killed
many
buffalo
and
made
much
dried
meat
all
their
sacks
were
full
and
the
dried
meat
was
piled
up
out
of
doors
after
the
second
surround
they
feasted
as
before
after
four
days
as
they
were
going
out
to
surround
the
buffalo
the
third
time
the
wind
changed
and
before
the
people
got
near
them
the
buffalo
smelt
them
and
stampeded
while
they
were
galloping
away
the
man
ran
up
on
to
the
top
of
the
hill
to
the
place
of
sacrifice
carrying
a
pole
on
which
was
tied
the
skin
of
a
kit
fox
and
when
he
saw
the
buffalo
running
and
that
the
people
could
not
catch
them
he
waved
his
pole
and
called
out
and
the
buffalo
turned
right
about
and
charged
back
right
through
the
people
and
they
killed
many
of
them
he
wished
to
show
the
people
that
he
had
the
power
over
the
buffalo
after
the
third
surround
they
had
a
great
deal
of
meat
and
he
called
the
chiefs
together
and
said
now
my
chiefs
are
you
satisfied
they
said
yes
we
are
satisfied
and
we
are
thankful
to
you
for
taking
pity
on
us
and
helping
us
it
is
through
your
power
that
the
tribe
has
been
saved
from
starving
to
death
he
said
you
are
to
make
one
more
surround
and
that
will
be
the
end
i
want
you
to
get
all
you
can
kill
as
many
as
possible
for
this
will
be
the
last
of
the
buffalo
this
winter
those
presents
that
you
have
made
to
me
and
that
i
did
not
wish
to
take
i
give
them
back
to
you
some
of
the
people
would
not
take
back
the
presents
but
insisted
that
he
should
keep
them
and
at
last
he
said
he
would
do
so
the
fourth
surround
was
made
and
the
people
killed
many
buffalo
and
saved
the
meat
the
night
after
this
last
surround
he
disappeared
and
drove
the
buffalo
back
the
next
morning
he
told
the
people
to
look
about
and
tell
him
if
they
saw
anything
they
did
so
but
they
could
not
see
any
buffalo
the
next
day
they
moved
camp
and
went
east
toward
their
home
they
had
so
much
dried
meat
that
they
could
not
take
it
all
at
once
but
had
to
come
back
and
make
two
trips
for
it
when
they
moved
below
going
east
they
had
no
fresh
meat
only
dried
meat
but
sometimes
when
this
man
would
come
in
from
his
journeys
he
would
bring
a
piece
of
meat
a
little
piece
and
he
would
divide
it
up
among
the
people
and
they
would
put
it
into
the
kettles
and
boil
it
and
everybody
would
eat
but
they
could
not
eat
it
all
up
there
would
always
be
some
left
over
this
man
was
so
wonderful
that
he
could
change
even
the
buffalo
chips
that
you
see
on
the
prairie
into
meat
he
would
cover
them
up
with
his
robe
and
when
he
would
take
it
off
again
you
would
see
there
pounded
buffalo
meat
and
tallow
pemmican
the
man
was
not
married
he
was
a
young
man
and
by
this
time
the
people
thought
that
he
was
one
of
the
greatest
men
in
the
tribe
and
they
wanted
him
to
marry
they
went
to
one
of
the
chiefs
and
told
him
that
they
wanted
him
to
be
this
man
for
they
wanted
him
to
raise
children
thinking
that
they
might
do
something
to
benefit
the
tribe
they
did
not
want
that
race
to
die
out
the
old
people
say
that
it
would
have
been
good
if
he
had
had
children
but
he
had
none
if
he
had
perhaps
they
would
have
had
the
same
power
as
their
father
that
person
called
the
buffalo
twice
and
twice
saved
the
tribe
from
a
famine
the
second
time
the
suffering
was
great
and
they
held
a
council
to
ask
him
to
help
the
tribe
they
filled
up
the
pipe
and
held
it
out
to
him
asking
him
to
take
pity
on
the
tribe
he
took
the
pipe
and
lighted
it
and
smoked
he
did
it
in
the
same
way
as
the
first
time
and
they
made
four
surrounds
and
got
much
meat
when
this
man
died
all
the
people
mourned
for
him
a
long
time
the
chief
would
ride
around
the
village
and
call
out
now
i
am
poor
in
mind
on
account
of
the
death
of
this
man
because
he
took
pity
on
us
and
saved
the
tribe
now
he
is
gone
and
there
is
no
one
left
like
him
this
is
a
true
and
sacred
story
that
belongs
to
the
band
it
happened
once
long
ago
and
has
been
handed
down
from
father
to
son
in
this
band
the
skidi
had
a
man
who
once
called
the
buffalo
causing
them
to
return
when
stampeded
as
was
done
in
this
story
big
knife
a
skidi
who
died
only
recently
said
that
the
man
was
alive
in
his
time
bear
chief
a
skidi
says
that
he
knew
the
man
his
name
was
carrying
mother
illustration
baby
on
board
about
the
end
of
the
winter
before
the
grass
began
to
grow
in
the
spring
a
company
of
three
brothers
and
two
other
men
went
out
from
the
village
to
trap
beaver
when
they
had
been
gone
about
ten
days
and
had
got
up
above
the
forks
of
the
loup
river
they
camped
on
the
south
fork
and
in
the
morning
sent
one
man
ahead
to
see
if
he
could
find
any
beaver
sign
and
could
look
out
a
good
trapping
ground
when
he
had
gone
a
little
distance
from
the
camp
he
saw
some
sioux
and
at
the
same
moment
they
saw
him
he
did
not
run
back
to
the
camp
he
was
too
anxious
to
save
himself
but
ran
across
to
a
little
creek
and
hid
in
the
brush
not
trying
to
let
his
brothers
know
that
the
enemy
were
near
the
sioux
followed
him
and
found
him
and
chased
him
about
and
shot
at
him
all
day
until
near
sundown
when
they
killed
him
the
four
other
men
had
stopped
in
camp
but
were
not
so
far
off
but
that
they
could
hear
the
shouts
and
yells
and
they
ran
off
from
the
camp
and
hid
themselves
and
waited
when
the
other
man
did
not
come
back
they
knew
that
he
had
been
killed
the
next
morning
the
four
men
talked
together
one
said
we
had
better
go
up
and
see
if
he
is
killed
another
said
yes
let
us
go
there
it
may
be
that
we
can
bury
him
so
they
went
up
where
he
had
been
going
very
carefully
and
looking
over
all
the
hills
as
they
went
so
as
to
see
any
enemies
if
they
were
about
they
found
him
he
was
dead
shot
full
of
arrows
scalped
his
whole
head
skinned
his
arms
and
legs
unjointed
his
head
cut
off
he
was
all
cut
to
pieces
so
they
thought
that
there
was
not
enough
of
him
left
to
bury
and
besides
those
killed
in
battle
are
often
left
unburied
when
they
found
how
it
was
they
started
back
to
the
village
and
when
they
came
close
to
it
one
of
the
men
called
out
is
killed
he
called
that
out
so
that
the
people
might
know
and
might
begin
to
mourn
when
they
came
into
the
village
the
relations
of
this
man
felt
very
badly
because
he
was
killed
it
was
coming
on
toward
the
time
when
they
begin
to
clear
up
their
patches
to
plant
the
corn
and
to
hoe
and
his
father
and
mother
mourned
and
said
now
we
have
no
one
to
help
us
hoe
we
are
old
and
he
helped
us
but
now
he
is
gone
so
they
mourned
for
him
they
did
not
visit
the
place
where
he
had
been
killed
for
some
time
it
was
now
spring
and
they
were
planting
and
hoeing
the
corn
and
when
they
got
through
their
work
the
whole
tribe
started
out
on
the
summer
hunt
to
get
buffalo
as
they
used
to
do
they
started
up
the
loup
and
when
they
had
traveled
along
a
number
of
days
they
came
near
the
place
where
the
man
had
been
killed
when
they
got
there
the
men
who
had
been
with
him
said
this
is
the
place
where
was
killed
and
his
father
and
mother
and
all
his
relations
went
over
to
the
place
where
he
had
lain
to
gather
his
bones
together
and
then
to
bury
them
when
they
got
to
the
place
they
could
find
no
bones
at
all
but
the
arrows
were
there
sticking
straight
up
in
the
ground
all
the
arrows
that
had
been
shot
into
the
body
they
wondered
that
they
had
not
fallen
down
for
they
thought
that
the
wolves
might
have
dragged
the
body
but
when
they
looked
everywhere
about
for
the
bones
they
could
find
no
sign
of
them
anywhere
it
seemed
strange
to
them
that
the
arrows
should
be
there
standing
up
in
the
ground
and
they
wondered
what
had
become
of
the
bones
at
length
they
gave
up
looking
for
them
and
went
back
to
the
camp
when
they
could
not
find
the
bones
they
went
on
and
hunted
buffalo
and
killed
plenty
and
made
dried
meat
after
two
months
they
started
back
to
the
village
going
down
the
platte
river
his
mother
had
cried
so
much
for
that
she
had
become
blind
one
pleasant
afternoon
they
were
camped
on
the
platte
the
evening
was
warm
and
soft
and
still
as
the
sun
went
down
toward
the
earth
long
shining
rays
seemed
to
come
down
from
it
to
the
ground
all
through
the
air
was
a
light
smoke
and
in
the
west
the
sky
was
red
just
as
the
sun
was
setting
the
people
all
heard
a
voice
calling
from
the
other
side
of
the
river
they
listened
and
the
voice
said
is
coming
back
to
you
then
all
the
indians
jumped
up
and
ran
across
the
river
to
meet
him
for
they
thought
perhaps
he
was
coming
back
when
they
had
got
to
the
other
side
they
looked
about
but
could
see
no
one
then
they
heard
a
voice
from
behind
them
on
the
other
side
of
the
camp
which
said
he
is
coming
from
here
they
all
turned
round
and
ran
back
to
the
other
side
of
the
camp
but
no
one
was
there
and
in
a
little
while
they
heard
the
voice
again
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
saying
he
is
coming
then
they
knew
it
was
only
a
voice
and
not
a
person
they
stopped
running
about
and
that
night
they
talked
about
the
voice
the
next
day
they
went
on
down
the
river
and
at
length
got
back
to
the
main
village
there
they
stayed
six
months
and
by
this
time
their
dried
meat
was
all
eaten
and
it
was
toward
spring
the
mother
of
had
her
bed
near
the
door
of
the
lodge
on
the
left
hand
side
the
last
bed
next
to
the
door
one
night
at
midnight
he
came
into
the
lodge
and
touched
his
mother
and
said
mother
mother
his
mother
used
to
dream
of
him
almost
every
night
and
she
thought
she
was
dreaming
now
she
said
oh
my
son
do
not
do
this
you
are
deceiving
me
again
he
stopped
but
presently
he
touched
her
again
and
pushed
her
shoulder
and
she
awoke
he
said
to
her
mother
i
am
here
and
she
reached
out
and
felt
him
she
said
are
you
really
my
son
he
answered
yes
i
am
your
son
then
she
put
her
arms
around
him
and
hugged
him
and
said
to
him
oh
my
son
my
son
you
have
come
back
to
me
she
cried
she
was
so
glad
then
they
talked
together
he
gave
her
a
piece
of
meat
a
piece
of
fresh
buffalo
meat
though
they
had
had
no
fresh
meat
in
the
village
for
six
months
he
said
to
his
mother
i
am
really
alive
though
i
was
killed
the
animals
took
pity
on
me
and
have
made
me
alive
again
and
now
i
am
going
off
but
do
not
cry
about
me
any
more
then
he
went
away
the
next
morning
when
his
mother
awoke
she
found
by
her
side
the
piece
of
fresh
meat
and
she
began
to
cook
it
on
the
coals
the
people
wondered
where
she
got
the
fresh
meat
and
asked
her
about
it
but
she
would
not
tell
them
where
she
got
it
for
her
son
had
told
her
to
say
nothing
they
asked
her
again
where
she
got
it
and
she
told
them
she
found
it
in
her
bed
after
a
long
time
her
son
came
again
in
the
night
and
went
into
the
lodge
and
spoke
to
his
mother
saying
mother
i
am
here
again
she
awoke
and
rejoiced
that
he
had
come
back
he
said
to
her
my
mother
i
know
that
you
are
poor
you
are
blind
on
account
of
me
because
you
have
cried
so
much
now
my
mother
there
is
standing
by
the
side
of
your
daughter
bed
water
in
a
wooden
bowl
after
i
have
left
you
go
over
there
and
put
your
face
down
deep
into
the
water
and
open
your
eyes
in
the
water
and
then
you
will
see
before
he
left
her
he
gave
her
some
chopped
buffalo
meat
tied
up
in
the
small
intestine
after
he
had
gone
she
did
as
he
had
told
her
she
got
up
and
feeling
her
way
along
with
her
hands
crept
into
the
place
where
her
daughter
slept
there
she
felt
the
wooden
bowl
with
water
in
it
and
she
put
her
face
deep
down
into
the
water
and
opened
her
eyes
in
it
and
when
she
took
her
face
out
of
the
water
and
opened
her
eyes
again
she
could
see
then
she
was
glad
everybody
wondered
how
the
mother
eyes
had
been
cured
but
she
told
no
one
except
only
her
oldest
son
after
a
long
time
came
down
again
to
see
his
mother
he
said
to
her
mother
i
am
going
up
to
see
my
oldest
brother
he
went
to
see
his
brother
in
the
night
his
brother
was
expecting
him
for
his
mother
had
warned
him
said
now
my
brother
i
think
you
have
heard
that
i
come
all
the
time
to
see
our
mother
i
wish
that
you
would
put
up
your
lodge
outside
the
camp
so
that
i
can
come
and
see
you
often
i
want
to
talk
to
you
and
tell
you
my
thoughts
and
all
my
troubles
i
am
a
spirit
his
brother
answered
him
that
he
would
do
as
he
had
asked
and
the
first
night
after
the
lodge
had
been
set
up
outside
the
camp
came
down
and
said
to
his
brother
night
i
want
you
to
select
the
two
bravest
men
in
the
tribe
and
let
them
go
about
through
the
camp
and
call
all
the
chiefs
and
all
the
bravest
warriors
in
the
tribe
and
let
them
gather
at
your
home
do
not
build
any
fire
in
the
lodge
let
it
all
be
dark
for
i
am
coming
down
in
the
night
to
see
them
when
the
next
night
came
the
chiefs
and
the
braves
gathered
at
the
lodge
just
about
dark
they
made
no
fire
but
sat
there
waiting
for
to
come
down
after
a
while
he
came
down
to
the
lodge
and
came
in
where
they
were
sitting
when
they
were
all
silent
he
came
in
and
every
step
he
made
it
seemed
that
sparks
of
fire
were
flying
out
from
him
he
went
and
stood
before
his
brother
and
said
to
him
i
am
in
everything
in
the
grass
the
water
the
trees
i
am
a
part
of
all
these
things
i
know
every
thought
of
yours
and
if
you
only
whispered
i
would
hear
it
i
know
everything
and
about
everything
even
about
the
ocean
which
is
so
far
off
and
where
the
water
is
salt
there
are
two
dances
that
i
like
in
which
there
are
songs
sung
about
me
then
he
sang
these
songs
and
told
them
how
to
dance
these
dances
he
said
dance
these
dances
and
sing
about
me
calling
me
by
name
these
dances
afterward
were
practiced
in
two
of
the
secret
societies
then
he
said
brother
i
want
you
to
know
that
there
is
a
tribe
of
your
enemies
getting
ready
to
go
on
the
warpath
against
you
i
will
let
you
know
when
they
start
and
all
they
do
every
move
they
make
i
will
tell
you
of
they
are
coming
from
far
up
the
missouri
river
two
or
three
nights
later
appeared
to
his
brother
and
said
they
are
coming
night
they
will
be
here
spying
round
the
camp
be
ready
for
them
you
must
ask
me
to
take
pity
on
you
telling
me
what
you
want
to
do
and
i
will
make
you
strong
so
that
you
can
succeed
if
you
want
to
strike
two
or
three
ask
me
if
you
want
to
kill
two
or
three
tell
me
you
must
call
me
grandfather
the
next
night
they
danced
and
asked
him
to
take
pity
on
them
one
young
man
prayed
saying
let
me
strike
nine
and
at
the
tenth
let
me
be
wounded
but
let
me
not
die
a
second
young
man
prayed
saying
i
want
to
strike
five
and
capture
the
biggest
man
in
the
party
another
man
asked
him
let
me
strike
two
and
then
let
me
be
killed
to
each
one
who
asked
a
favor
of
him
he
said
let
it
be
so
they
did
not
see
him
for
there
was
no
fire
in
the
lodge
it
was
dark
he
said
to
them
be
ready
morning
is
the
time
when
the
enemy
will
attack
you
i
will
send
a
fog
from
the
north
as
a
warning
they
will
come
down
toward
the
village
and
you
must
go
out
on
the
plain
in
front
of
the
village
and
have
a
skirmish
with
them
then
draw
off
and
look
toward
the
point
of
bluff
which
runs
down
into
the
plain
on
the
east
end
of
the
battle
field
watch
that
point
and
you
will
see
me
i
will
appear
to
you
there
and
this
shall
be
a
sign
to
you
that
it
is
i
whom
you
see
when
i
come
up
over
that
point
and
turn
around
facing
to
the
north
the
wind
will
change
and
will
come
from
the
south
and
when
the
wind
blows
from
the
south
you
make
a
charge
on
them
so
it
was
the
next
morning
the
enemy
made
an
attack
on
them
and
came
down
toward
the
village
it
was
the
very
day
he
had
said
the
warriors
went
out
on
the
plain
to
meet
them
they
were
wondering
in
what
shape
would
appear
to
them
how
he
would
look
on
that
morning
before
the
sioux
appeared
a
white
fog
came
down
from
the
north
then
the
sioux
made
the
attack
and
the
people
began
to
look
for
and
while
they
were
looking
toward
the
bluff
a
great
white
wolf
came
up
over
the
point
and
stood
looking
first
one
way
and
then
another
and
then
it
turned
around
and
faced
the
north
and
immediately
the
wind
changed
and
blew
from
the
south
when
the
wolf
appeared
some
of
the
braves
doubted
whether
it
was
but
when
it
turned
round
and
the
wind
changed
then
they
knew
that
it
was
he
then
they
made
the
charge
and
each
one
of
those
who
had
asked
a
favor
received
it
in
every
case
what
had
promised
came
true
the
man
who
had
prayed
that
he
might
strike
nine
and
at
the
tenth
be
wounded
struck
nine
and
was
wounded
at
the
tenth
but
he
did
not
die
the
one
who
asked
to
strike
five
and
to
capture
the
biggest
man
in
the
party
did
so
he
caught
the
prisoner
and
overcame
him
and
put
a
rope
around
his
neck
and
led
him
into
the
village
and
when
he
got
him
to
the
village
the
women
beat
the
captive
with
sticks
and
clubs
and
threw
dirt
at
him
and
had
lots
of
fun
with
him
the
young
man
who
had
asked
it
killed
two
and
then
was
himself
killed
all
that
had
promised
came
to
pass
the
people
killed
many
of
the
sioux
and
drove
them
far
chasing
and
killing
them
all
day
long
then
they
came
back
to
the
village
bringing
with
them
the
scalps
and
the
weapons
that
they
had
taken
the
bows
and
the
spears
the
shields
and
the
war
bonnets
they
danced
in
the
village
and
sang
and
rejoiced
every
one
was
glad
because
the
people
had
won
a
great
victory
the
next
night
after
the
day
of
the
battle
came
down
to
his
brother
lodge
and
told
him
that
he
wanted
to
speak
to
him
his
brother
awoke
all
his
wives
and
sent
them
out
of
the
lodge
telling
them
not
to
come
back
until
he
called
them
then
said
to
his
brother
now
my
brother
you
people
have
seen
whether
what
i
say
to
you
is
true
or
not
you
have
seen
what
has
happened
you
can
judge
now
brother
i
want
you
to
feel
of
me
all
over
nobody
else
but
you
to
feel
of
me
my
brother
his
brother
passed
his
hands
all
over
his
breast
and
arms
and
body
and
legs
said
now
put
your
hands
on
top
of
my
head
and
feel
there
he
did
so
and
felt
something
soft
said
do
you
know
what
that
is
that
is
the
down
feathers
then
he
told
the
story
of
his
being
killed
he
said
that
time
after
i
got
killed
all
kinds
of
took
pity
on
me
the
flies
and
bugs
the
fishes
and
birds
the
deer
and
the
wolves
all
the
animals
took
pity
on
me
and
helped
me
to
come
to
life
again
they
looked
all
over
for
my
flesh
and
my
bones
and
brought
them
all
together
one
part
of
me
the
top
part
of
my
skull
they
could
not
find
the
bugs
crept
through
the
ground
looking
for
it
the
fishes
swam
through
the
water
and
sought
it
the
flies
buzzed
about
over
the
sand
and
the
deer
and
wolves
hunted
for
it
on
the
prairie
but
they
could
not
find
this
piece
anywhere
nor
could
they
find
my
brains
perhaps
when
i
was
killed
the
crows
eat
them
out
when
they
had
gathered
the
pieces
all
together
they
laid
each
piece
in
its
own
place
so
that
they
had
the
form
of
a
man
and
in
place
of
the
top
of
the
skull
and
the
brains
they
put
the
down
feathers
after
they
had
put
all
the
pieces
together
they
stood
around
me
and
prayed
and
passed
their
paws
over
me
and
danced
and
sang
and
at
last
i
breathed
a
little
then
they
prayed
again
and
passed
their
paws
over
me
and
at
length
i
breathed
regularly
then
i
was
not
dead
any
more
i
was
alive
again
not
as
a
person
was
i
alive
but
as
a
spirit
i
am
in
every
thing
in
the
wind
in
the
rain
in
the
grass
i
go
over
the
whole
world
i
am
the
wind
and
i
go
everywhere
all
over
the
world
there
is
no
one
above

but
he
is
the
only
one

am
under

ruler
of
all
whenever
any
human
being
on
this
earth

helped
i
will

so
long
as

come
to
you
i
want
you
people
to
conquer
the
sioux
all
you
can
on
account
of
what
they
did
to
me
when
they
killed
me
and
cut
me
in
pieces
so
long
as
the
sioux
come
down
to
attack
you
i
want
you
to
conquer
them
every
time
now

come
down
to
see
you

must
not
get
tired
of
me
i
want
to
come
down
often
to
see
you
and
talk
to
you
to
tell
you
what
is
going
to
happen
and
to
warn
you
whenever
the
sioux
are
coming
down
to
attack
the
skidi
i
go
about
everywhere
to
the
camps
of
the
different
bands
of
sioux
and
i
know
what
the
chiefs
are
saying
in
council
when
they
are
talking
of
sending
out
war
parties
against
you
if
i
come
down
to
you
often
do
not
get
tired
of
seeing
me
he
knew
himself
that
his
brother
would
some
time
refuse
to
listen
to
him
but
his
brother
did
not
know
it
and
he
said
i
will
never
get
tired
of
you
some
time
after
this
the
sioux
came
down
again
to
attack
the
skidi
village
two
days
before
they
came
came
down
to
his
brother
and
warned
him
saying
a
big
war
party
of
sioux
will
be
here
day
after
to
fight
with
you
but
i
am
going
to
attend
to
them
on
the
morning
of
the
second
day
from
this
tell
all
the
people
to
be
ready
and
to
have
their
horses
tied
up
close
to
the
lodges
where
they
can
get
at
them
then
if
you
look
up
in
the
sky
you
will
see
thick
black
clouds
as
if
you
were
going
to
have
a
great
rain
when
you
begin
fighting
do
not
be
afraid
of
the
enemy
do
not
be
afraid
of
them
go
right
up
to
them
they
will
not
be
able
to
shoot
their
bowstrings
will
be
wet
and
the
sinews
will
stretch
and
slip
off
the
ends
of
the
bows
they
will
not
be
able
to
hurt
you
on
the
morning
that
he
had
said
the
sioux
came
down
and
the
people
went
out
to
meet
them
the
sky
above
was
black
with
clouds
when
they
began
fighting
a
heavy
rain
commenced
to
fall
but
it
did
not
rain
everywhere
but
only
just
where
the
sioux
were
the
bowstrings
of
the
sioux
got
wet
so
that
they
could
not
use
them
for
the
sinews
stretched
so
that
when
they
bent
their
bows
the
strings
slipped
off
the
ends
of
the
bows
and
there
was
no
force
to
their
arrows
the
skidi
overcame
the
sioux
and
drove
them
and
the
sioux
ran
far
the
rain
followed
the
sioux
and
rained
over
them
but
nowhere
else
and
the
sioux
fled
and
the
skidi
won
a
great
victory
soon
after
this
came
down
and
visited
his
brother
and
said
to
him
my
brother
whenever
you
have
a
feast
or
a
council
of
old
men
you
must
smoke
to
me
and
say
we
want
you
to
help
us
then
i
will
hear
you
at
the
same
time
you
must
pray
to
there
is
one
above
us
who
is
the
ruler
of
all
i
do
not
wish
to
be
talked
about
commonly
or
by
common
men
but
that
whenever
you
have
a
feast
you
should
call
in
the
young
men
and
tell
them
about
me
and
let
them
hear
he
did
not
want
his
name
used
irreverently
nor
wish
that
the
story
of
what
he
had
suffered
and
done
should
be
told
commonly
or
for
mere
amusement
it
is
sacred
and
should
be
told
only
at
solemn
times
some
time
after
this
talk
with
his
brother
he
came
down
again
to
see
him
another
man
was
living
in
his
brother
lodge
and
on
this
night
his
brother
was
not
there
he
was
sleeping
somewhere
else
asked
this
man
where
his
brother
was
he
answered

is
sleeping
somewhere
else
said

over
and
tell
him
that
i
am
here
and
that
i
want
to
see

the
man
went
and
gave
the
message
to
the
brother
who
said
i
do
not
want
to
go
tell
him
i
am
asleep
the
man
went
back
and
told
that
his
brother

much
the
brother
said

him

ca

want
to
sleep
the
man
returned
and
said
he
does
not
want
to
come
he
is

he
was
sent
back
for
the
brother
the
third
time
to
tell
the
brother
he
must
come
he
was
wanted
he
sent
word
back
that
he
could

too

then
said

and
tell
him
to

before
that
he

of
me
at
last
let
him

to
him

sometimes
and
to
pray
to
me
and
i
will
help
them
and
care
for
the
tribe
so
went
away
to
the
rees
and
the
people
knew
him
no
more
after
that
he
never
came
down
to
see
them
when
the
people
learned
this
they
felt
very
badly
and
were
angry
at
his
brother
who
would
not
see
him
there
was
living
not
long
ago
among
the
rees
an
old
woman
who
when
she
was
a
girl
had
seen
and
talked
to
this
is
a
skidi
story
the
rees
have
a
story
of
what
did
after
he
had
come
to
them
the
lower
village
tribes
have
a
story
of
a
hero
of
this
same
name
which
is
quite
different
from
that
of
the
skidi
illustration
lone
chief
skidi
the
boy
who
was
sacrificed
there
was
a
time
far
back
when
some
people
thought
that
it
was
good
to
sacrifice
to
whatever
they
had
that
was
most
precious
to
them
the
sacrifice
of
the
animal
the
burnt
offering
has
always
been
made
by
all
the
pawnees
that
is
one
of
the
things
handed
down
from
the
ruler
it
is
very
old
the
skidi
have
always
performed
the
sacrifice
of
the
captive
each
one
of
these
is
sacred
and
solemn
but
it
is
not
like
giving
up
something
that
belongs
to
you
and
that
you
love
it
is
a
sacrifice
but
it
does
not
cost
much
many
years
ago
in
the
skidi
village
on
the
loup
there
lived
a
man
who
believed
that
if
he
sacrificed
his
son
to
it
would
be
a
blessing
to
him
he
thought
that
if
he
did
this
thing
perhaps
would
speak
to
him
face
to
face
and
that
he
could
talk
to
him
just
as
two
people
would
talk
to
one
another
and
that
in
this
way
he
would
learn
many
things
that
other
people
did
not
understand
his
child
was
a
nice
boy
about
ten
years
old
strong
growing
up
well
and
the
man
loved
him
it
made
him
feel
badly
to
think
of
killing
him
he
meditated
long
about
this
but
the
more
he
thought
about
it
the
more
he
believed
that
this
sacrifice
would
please
there
were
many
things
that
he
wanted
to
understand
and
to
do
and
he
thought
if
he
gave
up
his
son
these
good
things
would
come
to
him
so
he
resolved
to
make
the
sacrifice
one
morning
he
started
out
from
the
village
and
took
the
boy
with
him
they
went
over
to
the
platte
when
they
got
to
the
river
as
they
were
walking
along
the
man
took
his
knife
from
its
sheath
and
caught
the
boy
by
the
shoulder
and
stabbed
him
quickly
and
cut
him
open
when
the
boy
was
dead
he
threw
the
body
into
the
river
and
then
went
back
to
the
village
when
he
got
there
he
went
into
his
lodge
and
sat
down
after
a
time
he
said
to
his
wife
where
is
the
boy
the
woman
said
he
went
out
with
you
when
you
went
over
to
see
the
horses
the
man
answered
no
i
went
out
to
where
the
horses
are
feeding
and
looked
at
them
but
he
did
not
go
with
me
the
man
went
out
and
looked
for
the
boy
all
through
the
village
but
he
could
not
find
him
at
night
when
the
boy
did
not
come
home
they
began
to
get
frightened
and
for
two
days
they
hunted
for
the
boy
and
at
last
they
got
the
old
crier
to
call
out
for
him
from
the
top
of
the
lodge
and
ask
if
any
one
had
seen
him
but
none
of
the
people
knew
what
had
become
of
the
boy
now
the
mother
was
mourning
and
the
father
pretended
to
feel
very
badly
they
could
not
find
the
boy
and
soon
after
this
the
tribe
started
on
the
summer
hunt
and
the
father
and
mother
went
with
them
the
village
made
a
good
hunt
killing
plenty
of
buffalo
and
made
much
dried
meat
after
the
boy
had
been
thrown
into
the
river
he
floated
down
with
the
current
sometimes
turning
over
and
over
in
the
swift
water
and
sometimes
grounding
for
a
little
while
on
a
sand
bar
and
then
being
floated
off
again
and
being
carried
further
down
at
length
he
came
near
to
the
place
where
the
whirlpool
is
under
the
bluff
at
where
is
the
lodge
of
the
there
were
two
buzzards
sitting
on
the
bluff
just
above
this
place
and
as
they
sat
there
one
of
them
stretched
out
his
neck
and
looked
up
the
river
and
after
he
had
looked
he
said
to
the
other
i
see
a
body
then
both
the
buzzards
flew
down
to
where
the
boy
was
floating
in
the
water
and
got
down
under
him
and
raised
him
on
their
backs
and
lifted
him
up
out
of
the
water
and
flew
up
to
the
bluff
carrying
the
boy
on
their
backs
and
placed
him
on
the
ground
on
top
of
the
bluff
over
the
big
cave
which
is
the
home
of
the
in
this
lodge
were
all
kinds
of
animals
and
all
kinds
of
birds
there
were
bears
and
mountain
lions
and
buffalo
and
elk
and
beaver
and
otter
and
deer
all
kinds
of
animals
great
and
small
and
all
kinds
of
birds
there
is
a
little
bird
smaller
than
a
pigeon
its
back
is
blue
and
its
breast
white
and
its
head
is
spotted
it
flies
swiftly
over
the
water
and
when
it
sees
a
fish
it
dives
down
into
the
water
to
catch
it
this
bird
is
a
servant
or
a
messenger
for
the
such
a
bird
came
flying
by
just
as
the
buzzards
put
the
body
on
the
ground
and
he
stopped
and
looked
at
it
when
he
saw
how
it
was
for
he
knew
all
that
had
happened

after

in

the
messenger
was
not
long
in
deciding
he
did
not
hesitate
he
said
i
want
this
boy
brought
back
to
life
then
all
the
stood
up
and
went
to
where
the
boy
lay
and
stood
around
him
and
prayed
and
at
last
the
boy
breathed
once
and
then
after
a
little
while
he
breathed
again
and
at
last
he
came
to
life
and
sat
up
he
looked
about
and
saw
all
these
animals
standing
around
him
and
he
wondered
he
said
to
himself
why
my
father
stabbed
me
and
killed
me
and
now
here
i
am
among
this
great
crowd
of
animals
what
does
this
mean
he
was
surprised
the
all
went
back
into
the
lodge
and
took
the
boy
with
them
when
all
were
seated
in
the
lodge
the
four
judges
talked
to
each
other
and
the
chief
one
stood
up
and
said
now
my
people

brought
this
boy
back
to
life
but
he
is
poor
and
we
must
do
something
for
him
let
us
teach
him
all
we
know
and
make
him
one
of
us
then
the
all
made
a
noise
they
were
glad
then
they
began
to
sing
and
they
danced
they
taught
the
boy
all
their
secrets
and
all
their
ways
they
taught
him
how
to
cut
a
man
open
and
cure
him
again
and
how
to
shoot
an
arrow
through
a
man
and
then
cure
him
and
how
to
cut
a
man
tongue
out
and
then
to
put
it
back
and
how
to
make
well
a
broken
leg
and
many
other
things
after
they
had
done
all
these
things
they
said
to
the
boy
now
we
have
brought
you
back
to
life
and
have
taught
you
all
these
things
so
that
you
are
one
of
us
now
you
must
stop
with
us
one
season
your
people
have
gone
off
on
the
summer
hunt

must
stay
with
us
until
the
autumn

to
your
people
so
the
boy
stayed
with
the
in
their
lodge
at
length
the
skidi

returned
from
the
hunt
with
plenty
of
dried
meat

the
boy
went
home
to
the
village
he
got
there
in
the
night
and
went
to
his
father
lodge
and
went
in
there
was
a
little
fire
burning
in
the
lodge
it
was
nearly
out
and
gave
only
a
little
light
but
he
knew
the
place
where
his
mother
slept
he
went
up
to
her
and
put
out
his
hand
and
touched
her
and
pushed
her
a
little
she
awoke
and
sat
up
and
looked
at
him
and
he
said
i
come
back
when
she
saw
him
and
heard
him
speak
she
was
very
much
surprised
and
her
heart
was
glad
to
see
her
boy
again
she
called
to
his
father
and
he
woke
up
when
he
saw
the
boy
he
was
afraid
for
he
thought
it
was
a
ghost
the
boy
told
them
nothing
of
what
had
happened
or
where
he
had
been
he
just
said
i
have
come
back
again
in
the
morning
all
the
people
were
surprised
to
hear
that
he
had
come
back
and
to
see
him
and
they
stood
around
looking
at
him
and
asking
him
questions
but
he
said
nothing
the
next
day
the
people
still
questioned
him
and
at
last
the
boy
said
i
have
been
all
summer
with
friends
with
people
who
have
been
good
to
me
i
should
like
to
take
them
a
present
of
some
nice
dried
meat
so
that
we
can
have
a
feast
the
people
said
that
this
was
good
they
picked
out
four
strong
horses
and
loaded
them
with
dried
meat
the
nicest
pieces
the
father
gave
some
of
it
and
all
the
other
people
brought
pieces
and
put
them
on
the
horses
until
they
had
big
loads
they
sent
two
young
men
with
the
boy
to
help
him
load
and
drive
the
horses
and
they
started
to
go
to
the
lodge
at
when
they
had
come
pretty
near
the
place
the
boy
sent
the
young
men
back
to
the
village
and
he
went
on
alone
driving
the
before
him
when
he
reached
the
home
of
the
he
unloaded
the
horses
and
turned
them
loose
and
then
went
into
the
lodge
when
he
went
in
and
when
the
saw
him
they
all
made
a
hissing
noise
they
were
glad
to
see
him
the
boy
brought
into
the
lodge
all
the
dried
meat
and
they
had
a
great
feast
after
the
feast
they
had
a
doctors
dance
and
the
boy
was
made
a
doctor
and
again
was
taught
all
that
the
knew
after
that
he
could
do
many
wonderful
things
he
could
sometimes
go
to
a
man
that
had
been
dead
for
a
day
and
then
bring
him
back
to
life
no
one
ever
knew
what
the
father
had
done
for
the
boy
never
told
any
one
he
knew
that
he
could
never
have
learned
all
these
wonderful
things
unless
his
father
had
sacrificed
him
illustration
fleshers
the
snake
brother
one
time
long
ago
a
big
party
of
pawnees
went
on
the
warpath
down
to
the
south
they
could
find
no
enemies
anywhere
and
they
went
a
long
way
south
in
this
party
were
two
brothers
poor
boys
and
one
day
as
they
were
traveling
along
apart
from
the
others
in
a
piece
of
woods
where
it
was
very
thick
they
got
lost
when
they
found
that
they
were
lost
they
tried
to
go
back
to
the
camp
but
they
could
not
find
the
others
and
at
last
gave
up
looking
for
them
and
started
to
go
back
north
to
their
home
they
had
no
food
with
them
and
were
looking
about
for
something
to
kill
so
that
they
might
eat
as
they
were
going
along
they
came
upon
a
dead
buffalo
that
had
been
killed
some
time
and
there
was
nothing
of
it
left
but
the
bones
so
they
took
some
of
the
marrow
bones
and
carried
them
along
with
them
until
they
made
a
camp
not
far
beyond
here
they
stopped
to
rest
there
was
a
tree
growing
near
where
they
stopped
and
as
they
looked
up
into
it
they
saw
a
squirrel
run
up
the
tree
one
of
the
brothers
caught
up
his
bow
and
arrows
and
the
other
said
oh
kill
him
kill
him
quick
the
boy
shot
and
killed
it
and
they
skinned
it
and
roasted
it
over
the
fire
while
they
were
cooking
it
the
elder
brother
said
i
wonder
if
it
is
good
to
eat
the
marrow
and
the
squirrel
together
the
younger
said
no
it
is
not
good
to
do
so
this
is
not
real
meat
the
elder
thought
the
two
kinds
of
food
would
be
good
together
and
they
disputed
about
this
for
some
time
the
elder
brother
kept
coaxing
the
younger
to
eat
the
squirrel
and
the
marrow
together
but
the
younger
said
oh
brother
i
do
not
like
to
do
this
to
me
it
does
not
seem
good
but
if
you
wish
to
do
it
why
do
you
the
elder
said
i
think
i
will
do
so
and
he
did
so
taking
a
bite
of
squirrel
and
then
a
bite
of
marrow
he
said
it
is
nice
you
had
better
take
some
but
the
younger
brother
would
not
he
ate
only
the
marrow
after
they
had
eaten
they
did
not
go
on
further
but
slept
there
like
buffalo
meat
or
elk
or
deer
about
the
middle
of
the
night
the
elder
brother
felt
a
noise
in
his
feet
and
he
sat
up
and
felt
of
his
legs
and
feet
and
he
found
that
his
feet
were
stuck
together
and
were
beginning
to
get
round
like
a
snake
and
had
a
rattle
on
the
end
of
them
and
that
his
legs
were
round
and
like
the
tail
of
a
great
big
rattlesnake
he
reached
over
and
put
his
hands
on
his
brother
and
shook
him
and
said
to
him
get
up
there
is
something
the
matter
with
me
the
younger
brother
woke
up
and
felt
of
his
brother
and
found
how
it
was
as
if
he
was
changing
into
a
snake
beginning
at
his
feet
when
he
saw
this
he
felt
very
badly
then
the
older
brother
began
to
talk
to
the
younger
and
to
give
him
good
advice
for
he
felt
very
sad
he
said
now
i
am
going
to
die
and
leave
my
young
brother
here
alone
on
this
prairie
he
is
so
young
he
will
not
be
able
to
find
his
way
home
and
he
must
die
too
surely
this
has
happened
because
i
ate
the
marrow
and
the
squirrel
together
while
he
was
talking
the
change
had
moved
up
to
his
waist
after
a
little
while
he
got
more
hopeful
and
he
said
now
brother
i
know
that
you
will
get
home
safely
i
will
protect
you
i
know
that
i
am
going
to
be
a
snake
and
i
shall
stay
right
here
you
see
that
hole
and
he
pointed
to
a
hole
in
the
bank
when
i
have
changed
into
a
snake
take
me
in
your
arms
and
carry
me
over
to
that
hole
i
am
going
to
stay
there
forever
that
will
be
my
home
for
that
is
the
house
of
the
snakes
when
you
go
back
home
you
must
tell
our
father
and
mother
how
it
was
and
whenever
you
want
to
go
on
the
warpath
take
a
big
party
and
come
down
this
way
and
come
right
here
to
this
very
place
and
you
will
see
me
for
i
shall
be
here
now
brother
when
you
go
back
home
some
time
after
you
have
reached
home
i
want
you
to
come
back
all
alone
come
right
here
you
know
what
i
told
you
do
not
be
afraid
of
me
i
believe
this
was
to
happen
to
me
and
i
could
not
help
it
after
you
have
once
come
all
alone
then
the
second
time
you
may
bring
some
others
with
you
but
the
first
time
come
alone
so
he
talked
to
his
brother
and
as
he
spoke
the
change
kept
going
on
while
it
was
moving
up
his
body
until
it
got
to
his
head
he
was
still
like
a
man
in
his
mind
but
all
his
body
was
like
a
great
big
snake
then
he
spoke
to
his
brother
and
said
now
brother
cover
up
my
head
with
the
robe
and
after
a
little
while
take
it
off
again
the
younger
brother
did
as
he
was
told
and
when
after
a
while
he
took
the
robe
off
there
he
saw
an
immense
snake
head
as
broad
as
his
two
hands
the
elder
brother
had
completely
changed
into
a
snake
the
young
man
took
the
snake
in
his
arms
and
carried
him
over
to
the
hole
and
put
him
on
the
ground
by
it
he
felt
very
sad
to
go
away
and
leave
his
brother
here
before
he
started
he
spoke
good
words
to
the
snake
and
said
now
brother
i
am
going
home
and
i
ask
you
to
take
pity
on
me
and
to
protect
me
i
do
not
know
the
country
i
am
going
through
and
you
must
take
care
of
me
do
not
forget
the
promises
you
have
made
me
after
he
had
spoken
he
did
not
wait
to
see
the
snake
go
into
the
hole
but
started
on
his
journey
and
went
off
toward
his
home
when
he
reached
the
village
he
told
all
these
things
to
his
father
and
his
mother
he
said
to
all
his
relations
do
not
mourn
for
him
he
is
alive
and
he
is
well
the
only
trouble
is
that
he
is
in
the
shape
of
a
snake
after
he
had
been
home
ten
days
he
told
his
mother
to
make
for
him
five
pairs
of
moccasins
that
he
was
going
on
the
warpath
for
himself
his
mother
did
so
and
he
stuffed
them
full
of
parched
corn
and
took
a
little
sack
of
pounded
buffalo
meat
on
his
back
and
started
back
to
see
his
brother
it
took
him
seven
days
fast
traveling
to
get
to
where
he
left
the
snake
when
he
had
come
near
the
place
he
saw
there
the
hole
where
he
had
left
his
brother
he
went
up
close
to
the
hole
and
began
to
speak
he
said
brother
i
am
here
i
have
come
on
the
warpath
and
i
am
here
to
see
you
you
told
me
to
come
and
to
come
alone
i
have
done
what
you
bade
me
and
am
here
now
brother
remember
to
keep
your
promises
i
want
to
see
you
this
afternoon
he
stood
there
a
little
while
and
then
there
began
in
the
hole
a
rattling
and
a
rustling
and
scraping
noise
and
presently
dust
began
to
roll
out
and
then
out
of
the
hole
came
this
great
big
snake
which
was
his
brother
first
came
out
this
great
snake
and
after
him
many
other
large
ones
came
out
and
crept
all
about
but
the
great
snake
his
brother
lay
just
outside
the
hole
the
boy
went
up
to
the
big
snake
and
took
it
in
his
arms
and
hugged
it
and
spoke
to
it
and
the
snake
put
out
its
tongue
as
if
it
were
kissing
him
then
the
boy
put
it
down
on
the
ground
and
all
the
other
snakes
came
back
and
went
in
the
hole
and
after
them
all
last
the
big
snake
went
in
the
hole
then
the
boy
left
this
place
and
went
on
a
little
further
and
about
sunset
he
came
to
a
little
creek
and
here
he
lay
down
and
slept
in
the
night
he
dreamed
of
his
brother
who
spoke
to
him
and
said
now
brother
i
am
glad
that
you
have
come
down
to
see
me
as
i
told
you
to
and
now
i
say
to
you
be
brave
have
courage
morning
when
you
awake
dress
yourself
up
as
if
you
were
going
to
fight
paint
your
face
put
feathers
in
your
head
make
yourself
ready
to
fight
the
next
morning
the
boy
woke
up
and
as
the
snake
had
told
him
in
the
dream
so
he
did
he
painted
his
face
and
tied
feathers
in
his
head
and
dressed
himself
up
for
the
fight
then
he
started
on
pretty
soon
he
came
to
a
little
hill
and
as
he
looked
over
it
he
saw
people
coming
toward
him
people
and
many
horses
he
thought
they
were
sioux
and
when
he
saw
them
he
went
back
a
little
to
find
a
place
where
he
could
hide
he
went
back
to
the
little
creek
where
he
had
slept
and
there
he
sat
down
in
the
brush
when
he
had
hidden
himself
in
the
brush
he
waited
and
the
people
came
straight
toward
where
he
had
hidden
himself
and
camped
just
below
where
he
was
after
a
little
while
he
raised
himself
up
and
looked
at
them
and
saw
only
two
persons
and
presently
he
saw
that
one
of
them
was
a
woman
he
watched
for
a
long
time
looking
about
to
see
if
there
were
any
more
but
he
could
see
only
these
two
then
he
considered
what
he
should
do
while
he
was
thinking
it
came
to
him
what
the
snake
brother
had
said
to
him
in
the
night
and
then
he
knew
what
to
do
he
crept
slowly
along
through
the
brush
toward
their
camp
and
when
he
got
close
to
them
about
twenty
yards
distant
he
raised
up
his
head
and
looked
he
saw
the
woman
cooking
and
there
were
hanging
on
a
little
tree
the
man
bow
and
arrows
and
shield
and
spear
but
the
man
he
could
not
see
he
was
lying
down
asleep
somewhere
near
by
the
boy
waited
and
watched
he
was
excited
and
his
heart
was
pounding
against
his
ribs
after
a
little
while
the
woman
left
the
fire
and
walked
away
toward
the
horses
perhaps
her
husband
had
said
to
her
the
horses
are
going
off
you
had
better
go
and
turn
them
back
when
she
went
toward
the
horses
the
boy
was
going
to
run
up
to
the
man
and
kill
him
but
before
doing
so
he
changed
his
mind
for
he
thought
if
i
kill
him
perhaps
the
woman
will
get
on
a
horse
and
ride
away
driving
the
other
horses
with
her
so
he
waited
until
the
woman
had
come
back
when
she
had
returned
to
the
fire
he
ran
up
toward
her
and
she
heard
him
coming
and
ran
to
wake
her
husband
but
just
as
she
got
to
him
the
boy
was
by
her
side
he
shot
two
arrows
into
the
man
and
killed
him
and
counted
on
him
and
captured
the
woman
he
took
the
whole
scalp
of
his
enemy
head
then
he
took
the
woman
and
went
down
to
where
the
horses
were
and
they
got
on
two
of
them
and
rode
back
to
where
his
brother
the
snake
lived
driving
the
horses
before
them
just
before
they
got
to
the
hole
the
boy
took
his
lariat
and
caught
a
nice
spotted
horse
and
a
mule
and
tied
them
up
to
the
tree
and
called
up
the
woman
and
tied
her
up
against
the
tree
as
tight
as
he
could
tie
her
when
he
had
done
this
he
went
up
to
the
hole
and
began
to
talk
he
said
oh
my
brother
i
see
now
that
what
you
have
promised
me
comes
true
i
did
what
you
told
me
now
here
are
these
two
animals
and
the
woman
i
give
them
to
you
for
being
good
to
me
they
are
yours
i
am
glad
for
what
you
have
done
for
me
this
day
when
he
had
finished
saying
this
he
spoke
again
saying
now
brother
i
want
to
see
you
once
more
i
am
going
off
and
i
want
to
see
you
before
i
go
after
a
little
while
he
heard
again
the
rattling
sound
in
the
hole
and
saw
the
dust
coming
out
of
it
and
then
his
brother
came
out
of
the
hole
and
then
afterward
the
smaller
snakes
and
these
all
went
down
to
the
tree
and
climbed
up
into
it
the
tree
was
thick
with
them
then
the
boy
did
as
he
had
done
before
he
went
close
to
the
hole
and
took
his
brother
up
in
his
arms
and
hugged
him
and
the
great
snake
thrust
out
his
tongue
as
if
kissing
him
then
the
boy
spoke
again
and
said
now
brother
i
am
going
away
and
i
give
you
these
two
animals
and
this
woman
to
keep
they
are
yours
then
he
started
for
his
home
and
after
a
long
time
he
arrived
at
the
village
after
a
time
he
determined
to
start
off
again
on
the
warpath
and
this
time
he
took
a
party
with
him
he
had
told
the
whole
tribe
what
had
happened
and
how
his
brother
had
protected
and
helped
him
and
he
said
to
those
warriors
who
were
going
with
him
let
each
one
of
you
take
a
present
with
you
for
my
brother
some
beads
or
eagle
feathers
or
some
tobacco
as
an
offering
so
that
he
may
help
you
they
started
south
to
go
to
the
place
where
his
brother
lived
when
they
got
there
the
young
man
said
to
the
others
now
you
must
each
one
of
you
give
something
to
my
brother
call
him
by
his
kin
name
and
ask
him
to
help
you
and
to
make
you
successful
and
leave
the
things
before
the
hole
they
did
as
he
said
and
when
they
had
made
their
presents
they
went
by
they
saw
nothing
for
the
brother
did
not
call
out
the
great
snake
two
or
three
days
after
they
had
passed
the
place
they
found
a
camp
of
sioux
and
took
a
lot
of
horses
and
killed
some
of
the
enemy
then
they
went
back
and
when
they
came
to
the
snake
home
they
took
a
horse
and
led
it
up
near
the
hole
and
killed
it
and
gave
it
to
him
and
left
the
scalps
at
the
mouth
of
the
hole
as
presents
to
him
when
they
reached
the
village
there
was
great
joy
and
a
good
time
they
had
all
kinds
of
dances
for
they
were
glad
that
the
war
party
had
killed
some
sioux
after
that
another
war
party
started
out
and
the
brother
said
to
them
go
straight
to
my
brother
and
make
him
a
present
and
ask
him
to
give
you
good
luck
and
you
will
be
successful
and
it
happened
as
he
had
said
the
brother
was
always
fortunate
in
war
he
became
a
chief
and
was
very
rich
having
many
horses
ever
after
that
time
when
he
took
the
lead
of
a
war
party
all
the
poor
men
would
come
and
say
i
want
to
go
with
you
they
knew
that
his
brother
was
a
snake
and
would
give
him
good
luck
a
long
time
ago
as
the
tribe
were
on
their
summer
hunt
a
man
and
his
wife
got
to
quarreling
they
had
a
child
a
boy
about
ten
months
old
it
was
while
they
were
traveling
along
going
from
one
camp
to
another
that
they
began
to
quarrel
at
length
the
wife
became
very
angry
and
threw
the
baby
to
the
man
saying
you
take
that
baby
it
belongs
to
you
for
it
is
a
man
child
i
am
not
going
to
nurse
it
for
you
any
longer
then
she
went
away
the
man
took
the
child
and
carried
it
along
with
him
he
felt
very
badly
both
on
his
own
account
and
on
account
of
his
child
he
was
so
unhappy
that
he
almost
wanted
to
kill
himself
he
was
so
because
it
was
a
disgrace
that
he
being
a
man
should
be
obliged
to
take
care
of
his
child
until
it
was
grown
up
and
he
had
no
female
relatives
to
whom
he
could
turn
it
over
to
be
reared
so
he
was
very
unhappy
and
determined
to
leave
the
tribe
and
wander
off
alone
far
from
his
people
he
did
so
he
carried
the
child
on
his
back
as
a
woman
does
when
it
cried
for
its
mother
milk
he
had
none
to
give
it
he
could
only
cry
with
it
he
hated
to
kill
the
child
or
to
leave
it
behind
to
die
on
the
prairie
he
wandered
off
to
the
south
he
traveled
on
for
a
time
until
he
came
near
to
where
the
buffalo
were
by
this
time
the
child
had
changed
from
a
very
fat
baby
to
a
very
thin
one
because
it
had
not
been
nursed
when
he
got
to
the
buffalo
he
killed
a
cow
and
took
its
udder
and
while
it
was
fresh
he
let
the
child
suck
it
until
it
became
sour
then
he
killed
another
cow
and
did
the
same
thing
in
every
way
he
did
the
best
he
could
to
nourish
the
child
sometimes
he
would
get
a
slice
of
meat
and
half
cook
it
and
let
the
child
suck
the
juice
the
child
began
to
improve
and
to
get
a
little
stronger
in
this
way
he
supported
it
for
quite
a
long
time
and
it
did
pretty
well
and
at
last
it
got
used
to
this
food
and
became
strong
and
well
by
this
time
he
had
gone
a
long
way
at
length
he
found
that
the
child
could
sit
up
alone
then
he
began
to
give
it
all
sorts
of
playthings
so
that
it
could
amuse
itself
first
he
made
for
it
a
little
bow
and
some
arrows
and
taught
it
how
to
use
them
he
made
other
things
for
the
child
to
play
with
and
at
last
it
got
to
be
contented
playing
alone
then
the
father
would
leave
the
child
for
a
few
minutes
and
go
off
a
little
way
perhaps
to
the
top
of
a
hill
near
by
to
look
off
over
the
country
but
he
would
look
back
at
the
child
every
few
steps
to
see
that
it
was
all
right
when
he
would
come
back
he
would
find
the
child
safe
playing
well
contented
after
a
while
he
got
so
that
he
would
leave
it
for
about
an
hour
and
when
he
came
back
find
it
safe
and
contented
playing
by
this
time
the
child
had
begun
to
walk
finally
the
father
went
off
once
for
half
a
day
and
when
he
came
back
he
found
the
child
playing
about
safe
it
did
not
seem
to
mind
much
about
the
father
being
absent
about
this
time
he
killed
a
buffalo
cow
and
made
some
dried
meat
and
put
it
in
a
certain
place
and
told
the
child
when
it
was
hungry
to
go
there
and
get
a
a
piece
he
now
went
off
and
was
gone
a
whole
day
and
when
he
came
back
at
night
the
child
was
safe
finally
he
made
his
preparations
and
went
off
to
stay
over
night
and
be
gone
two
days
he
did
so
and
when
he
came
back
the
boy
was
asleep
a
second
time
he
went
away
and
was
absent
for
two
days
going
quite
a
long
distance
when
he
came
back
he
found
that
the
child
was
painted
with
white
clay
the
father
thought
this
was
strange
he
said
to
himself
something
must
have
come
and
talked
to
my
child
and
is
taking
care
of
him
while
i
am
gone
when
he
came
back
the
third
time
after
a
two
days
journey
he
found
that
the
child
had
about
his
neck
a
string
of
the
fourth
long
journey
he
took
lasted
three
days
and
when
he
returned
he
found
his
boy
still
wearing
this
same
string
of
beads
and
with
a
feather
tied
in
his
head
now
his
father
knew
that
something
was
looking
after
his
child
while
he
was
away
and
when
he
went
off
he
would
pray
for
the
child
he
would
say
whatever
it
is
that
is
taking
pity
on
my
child
also
take
pity
on
me
wild
currants
strung
like
beads
the
child
had
now
grown
so
large
that
it
could
talk
with
him
and
one
day
it
said
father
you
go
away
and
you
be
gone
for
four
days
i
will
be
all
right
here
when
you
come
back
you
will
find
me
safe
the
man
went
he
started
to
go
way
down
south
to
be
gone
for
four
days
after
he
had
been
gone
two
days
and
two
nights
he
saw
a
signal
smoke
and
went
toward
it
as
he
raised
up
his
head
and
peeped
over
a
hill
before
crossing
it
he
saw
far
off
a
lot
of
people
and
horses
coming
toward
the
river
which
lay
between
him
and
them
he
lay
on
the
hill
a
long
time
watching
to
see
where
they
would
camp
when
they
had
made
camp
he
went
into
a
ravine
and
crept
down
close
to
the
camp
until
he
could
see
that
it
was
just
one
lodge
and
that
about
it
were
a
whole
herd
of
horses
he
waited
until
evening
and
then
went
over
to
the
lodge
it
was
after
dark
when
he
went
the
lodge
was
all
surrounded
by
horses
everywhere
nothing
but
horses
there
were
so
many
he
crept
close
to
the
lodge
and
looked
in
through
an
opening
by
the
door
and
saw
lying
down
opposite
the
door
a
great
big
man
and
on
either
side
a
woman
only
three
persons
in
all
as
he
looked
at
these
persons
he
thought
he
recognized
one
of
the
women
he
kept
looking
at
her
and
at
last
he
remembered
who
she
was
and
that
she
had
been
captured
long
ago
from
the
pawnees
her
people
were
still
living
the
man
was
a
comanche
while
the
pawnee
was
watching
the
man
inside
the
lodge
asked
for
something
and
the
captive
woman
stood
up
to
go
out
of
the
lodge
and
the
pawnee
stepped
to
one
side
out
of
sight
the
woman
came
out
into
the
darkness
and
went
out
among
the
horses
the
pawnee
stepped
up
behind
her
very
softly
and
put
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
and
said
to
her
in
pawnee
friend
do
you
belong
to
my
tribe
the
woman
started
to
scream
but
he
put
his
hand
on
her
mouth
and
said
to
her
be
quiet
keep
still
do
not
call
out
she
answered
him
yes
i
belong
to
your
tribe
then
she
said
in
a
very
low
voice
that
shook
for
she
was
afraid
do
you
belong
to
my
tribe
the
man
said
yes
then
he
asked
her
who
is
that
other
woman
that
i
see
in
the
lodge
she
answered
him
she
also
belongs
to
our
tribe
and
is
a
prisoner
then
the
man
said
you
just
wait
and
keep
still
i
am
going
to
kill
that
man
the
woman
said
that
is
good
that
is
good
this
man
is
the
biggest
man
of
all
the
comanches
he
has
come
first
to
this
place
and
all
the
rest
of
the
comanches
are
coming
here
to
meet
him
i
am
glad
that
my
people
are
living
and
that
i
am
going
back
to
see
them
once
more
do
not
fail
to
kill
him
i
will
tell
the
other
woman
to
be
ready
that
our
friend
is
here
and
we
will
wait
and
watch
when
the
woman
went
into
the
lodge
she
whispered
to
the
other
woman
and
said
be
ready
a
friend
who
belongs
to
our
tribe
is
here
take
your
hatchet
and
be
prepared
to
help
to
kill
our
husband
the
two
women
waited
and
the
pawnee
made
ready
to
shoot
the
comanche
with
his
bow
and
arrow
the
woman
had
said
to
him
push
aside
the
door
a
little
and
be
ready
he
made
a
little
bit
of
an
opening
by
the
door
just
big
enough
to
let
an
arrow
pass
through
and
when
the
time
came
he
let
it
go
the
arrow
flew
straight
and
pierced
the
comanche
through
the
heart
so
he
died
and
the
pawnee
counted
on
him
and
took
his
scalp
the
women
felt
so
glad
to
meet
a
friend
that
they
put
their
arms
around
the
man
and
patted
him
they
were
going
back
home
to
see
their
relations
they
asked
him
how
many
of
you
are
here
he
answered
i
am
alone
they
were
surprised
they
took
down
the
lodge
and
packed
everything
on
the
horses
and
drove
off
the
herd
leaving
the
dead
body
of
the
enemy
in
the
camp
all
night
they
traveled
and
all
the
next
day
and
as
they
were
going
he
told
them
how
it
came
about
that
he
was
alone
they
told
him
that
there
were
about
three
hundred
head
of
horses
in
the
herd
that
they
had
with
them
when
they
had
come
pretty
close
to
where
he
had
left
the
child
he
told
them
about
the
boy
being
there
all
alone
and
the
women
just
ran
their
horses
to
get
to
the
boy
whichever
got
there
first
he
should
be
hers
when
they
came
to
the
boy
they
took
him
in
their
arms
and
petted
him
and
took
him
as
their
own
now
the
father
was
no
longer
sad
he
had
recovered
two
captured
women
had
killed
his
enemy
and
had
taken
a
lot
of
horses
they
went
on
and
traveled
far
and
at
length
one
night
they
came
to
the
pawnee
tribe
and
camped
with
them
the
horses
just
surrounded
the
lodge
you
could
just
see
the
top
of
it
over
their
backs
the
next
morning
all
the
people
wondered
who
these
strangers
could
be
they
found
out
that
the
man
and
child
who
were
lost
had
returned
and
with
them
two
women
captured
long
ago
by
the
comanches
so
there
was
great
joy
in
the
tribe
then
the
man
gave
his
relations
many
horses
in
those
days
the
pawnees
had
not
many
horses
and
it
seems
that
this
man
brought
good
luck
in
horses
to
the
tribe
ever
since
that
time
they
have
had
many
horses
the
mother
of
the
child
came
to
see
it
she
was
so
glad
it
was
alive
but
she
was
whipped
out
of
the
lodge
the
child
grew
to
be
a
man
and
was
wealthy
after
he
had
grown
up
he
told
his
father
that
ever
since
he
could
remember
anything
a
buck
deer
had
talked
to
him
and
taken
care
of
him
that
it
had
saved
them
and
brought
them
good
fortune
in
order
that
the
might
be
remembered
he
established
a
dance
called
the
deer
dance
which
has
been
kept
up
to
this
day
many
wonderful
things
happened
to
this
same
young
man
once
he
went
on
a
war
party
against
the
cheyennes
and
stole
some
horses
from
them
the
cheyennes
followed
and
overtook
them
and
they
had
a
great
fight
the
first
man
killed
was
this
young
man
he
was
very
brave
and
the
cheyennes
cut
him
up
into
small
pieces
but
that
night
it
lightened
and
thundered
and
rained
and
soon
after
the
storm
was
over
the
young
man
came
walking
into
camp
alive
he
was
all
scarred
over
where
he
had
been
cut
up
but
he
had
come
to
life
because
the
deer
had
looked
after
him
he
lived
long
to
show
the
scars
of
the
battles
he
had
been
through
the
ghost
bride
in
a
place
where
we
used
to
have
a
village
a
young
woman
died
just
before
the
tribe
started
on
the
hunt
when
she
died
they
dressed
her
up
in
her
finest
clothes
and
buried
her
and
soon
after
this
the
tribe
started
on
the
hunt
a
party
of
young
men
had
gone
off
to
visit
another
tribe
and
they
did
not
get
back
until
after
this
girl
had
died
and
the
tribe
had
left
the
village
most
of
this
party
did
not
go
back
to
the
village
but
met
the
tribe
and
went
with
them
on
the
hunt
among
the
young
men
who
had
been
away
was
one
who
had
loved
this
girl
who
had
died
he
went
back
alone
to
the
village
it
was
empty
and
silent
but
before
he
reached
it
he
could
see
far
off
some
one
sitting
on
top
of
a
lodge
when
he
came
near
he
saw
that
it
was
the
girl
he
loved
he
did
not
know
that
she
had
died
and
he
wondered
to
see
her
there
alone
for
the
time
was
coming
when
he
would
be
her
husband
and
she
his
wife
when
she
saw
him
coming
she
came
down
from
the
top
of
the
lodge
and
went
inside
when
he
came
close
to
her
he
spoke
and
said
why
are
you
here
alone
in
the
village
she
answered
him
they
have
gone
off
on
the
hunt
i
was
sulky
with
my
relations
and
they
went
off
and
left
me
behind
the
man
wanted
her
now
to
be
his
wife
but
the
girl
said
to
him
no
not
yet
but
later
we
will
be
married
she
said
to
him
you
must
not
be
afraid
there
will
be
dances
here
the
ghosts
will
dance
this
is
an
old
custom
of
the
pawnees
when
they
danced
they
used
to
go
from
one
lodge
to
another
singing
dancing
and
hallooing
so
now
when
the
tribe
had
gone
and
the
village
was
deserted
the
ghosts
did
this
he
could
hear
them
coming
along
the
empty
streets
and
going
from
one
lodge
to
another
they
came
into
the
lodge
where
he
was
and
danced
about
and
whooped
and
sang
and
sometimes
they
almost
touched
him
and
he
came
pretty
near
being
scared
the
next
day
the
young
man
persuaded
the
girl
to
go
on
with
him
and
follow
the
tribe
to
join
it
on
the
hunt
they
started
to
travel
together
and
she
promised
him
that
she
would
surely
be
his
wife
but
not
until
the
time
came
they
overtook
the
tribe
but
before
they
got
to
the
camp
the
girl
stopped
she
said
now
we
have
arrived
but
you
must
go
first
to
the
village
and
prepare
a
place
for
me
where
i
sleep
let
it
be
behind
a
curtain
for
four
days
and
four
nights
i
must
remain
behind
this
curtain
do
not
speak
of
me
do
not
mention
my
name
to
any
one
the
young
man
left
her
there
and
went
into
the
camp
when
he
got
to
his
lodge
he
told
a
woman
one
of
his
relations
to
go
out
to
a
certain
place
and
bring
in
a
woman
who
was
waiting
there
for
him
his
relative
asked
him
who
is
the
woman
and
to
avoid
speaking
her
name
he
told
who
were
her
father
and
mother
his
relation
in
surprise
said
it
can
not
be
that
girl
for
she
died
some
days
before
we
started
on
the
hunt
when
the
woman
went
to
look
for
the
girl
she
could
not
find
her
the
girl
had
disappeared
the
young
man
had
disobeyed
her
and
had
told
who
she
was
she
had
told
him
that
she
must
stay
behind
a
curtain
for
four
days
and
that
no
one
must
know
who
she
was
instead
of
doing
what
she
had
said
he
told
who
she
was
and
the
girl
disappeared
because
she
was
a
ghost
if
he
had
obeyed
the
girl
she
would
have
lived
a
second
time
upon
earth
that
same
night
this
young
man
died
in
sleep
then
the
people
were
convinced
that
there
must
be
a
life
after
this
one
illustration
interior
of
dirt
lodge
the
boy
who
saw
many
years
ago
the
pawnees
started
on
their
winter
hunt
the
buffalo
were
scarce
and
the
people
could
get
hardly
any
meat
it
was
very
cold
and
the
snow
lay
deep
on
the
ground
the
tribe
traveled
southward
and
crossed
the
republican
but
still
found
no
buffalo
they
had
eaten
all
the
dried
meat
and
all
the
corn
that
they
had
brought
with
them
and
now
they
were
starving
the
sufferings
of
the
people
were
great
and
the
little
ones
began
to
die
of
hunger
now
they
began
to
eat
their
robes
and
and
moccasins
there
was
in
the
tribe
a
boy
about
sixteen
years
old
who
was
all
alone
and
was
very
poor
he
had
no
relations
who
could
take
care
of
him
and
he
lived
with
a
woman
whose
husband
had
been
killed
by
the
sioux
she
had
two
children
a
boy
and
a
girl
and
she
had
a
good
heart
and
was
sorry
for
the
poor
boy
in
this
time
of
famine
these
people
had
scarcely
anything
to
eat
and
whenever
the
boy
got
hold
of
any
food
he
gave
it
to
the
woman
who
divided
it
among
them
all
the
tribe
kept
traveling
southward
looking
for
buffalo
but
they
had
to
go
very
slowly
because
they
were
all
so
weak
still
they
found
no
buffalo
and
each
day
the
young
men
that
were
sent
out
to
look
for
them
climbed
the
highest
hills
and
came
back
at
night
and
reported
that
they
could
only
see
the
white
prairie
covered
with
snow
all
this
time
little
ones
were
dying
of
hunger
and
the
men
and
women
were
growing
weaker
every
day
the
poor
boy
suffered
with
the
rest
and
at
last
he
became
so
weak
that
he
hardly
could
keep
up
with
the
camp
even
though
it
moved
very
slowly
one
morning
he
was
hardly
able
to
help
the
old
woman
pack
the
lodge
and
after
it
had
been
packed
he
went
back
to
the
fire
and
sat
down
beside
it
and
watched
the
camp
move
slowly
off
across
the
valley
and
up
over
the
bluffs
he
thought
to
himself
why
should
i
go
on
i
ca
keep
up
for
more
than
a
day
or
two
longer
anyhow
i
may
as
well
stay
here
and
die
so
he
gathered
together
the
ends
of
the
sticks
that
lay
by
the
fire
and
put
them
on
the
coals
and
spread
his
hands
over
the
blaze
and
rubbed
them
together
and
got
warm
and
then
lay
down
by
the
fire
and
pretty
soon
he
went
to
sleep
when
he
came
to
himself
it
was
about
the
middle
of
the
day
and
as
he
looked
toward
the
sky
he
saw
two
spots
there
between
him
and
the
sun
and
he
wondered
what
they
were
as
he
looked
at
them
they
became
larger
and
larger
and
at
last
he
could
see
that
they
were
birds
and
by
and
by
as
they
came
still
nearer
he
saw
that
they
were
two
swans
the
swans
kept
coming
lower
and
lower
and
at
last
they
alighted
on
the
ground
right
by
the
fire
and
walked
up
to
where
the
boy
lay
he
was
so
weak
he
could
not
get
up
and
they
came
to
him
one
on
each
side
and
stooped
down
and
pushed
their
shoulders
under
him
and
raised
him
up
and
put
him
on
their
backs
and
then
spread
their
broad
wings
and
flew
away
upward
then
the
boy
went
to
sleep
again
when
he
awoke
he
was
lying
on
the
ground
before
a
very
big
lodge
it
was
large
and
high
and
on
it
were
painted
pictures
of
many
strange
animals
in
beautiful
colors
the
boy
had
never
seen
such
a
fine
lodge
the
air
was
warm
here
and
he
felt
stronger
than
before
he
tried
to
raise
himself
up
and
after
trying
once
or
twice
he
got
on
his
feet
and
walked
to
the
door
of
the
lodge
and
went
in
opposite
the
door
sat
he
was
very
large
and
very
handsome
and
his
face
was
kind
and
gentle
he
was
dressed
in
beautiful
clothes
and
wore
a
white
buffalo
robe
behind
him
from
the
lodge
poles
hung
many
strange
weapons
around
the
lodge
on
each
side
sat
many
chiefs
and
doctors
and
warriors
they
all
wore
fine
clothes
of
white
buckskin
embroidered
with
beautifully
colored
quills
their
robes
were
all
of
beaver
skin
very
beautiful
when
the
boy
entered
the
lodge
said
to
him
welcome
my
son
and
sit
down
and
he
said
to
one
of
the
warriors
give
him
something
to
eat
the
warrior
took
down
a
beautifully
painted
sack
of
and
took
his
knife
from
its
sheath
and
cut
off
a
piece
of
dried
meat
about
as
big
as
one
two
fingers
and
a
piece
of
fat
about
the
same
size
and
gave
them
to
the
boy
the
boy
who
was
so
hungry
thought
that
this
was
not
very
much
to
give
to
one
who
was
starving
but
took
it
and
began
to
eat
he
put
the
fat
on
the
lean
and
cut
the
pieces
off
and
ate
for
a
long
time
but
after
he
had
eaten
for
a
long
time
the
pieces
of
meat
remained
the
same
size
and
he
ate
all
that
he
wanted
and
then
put
the
pieces
down
still
the
same
size
after
the
boy
had
finished
eating
spoke
to
him
he
told
him
that
he
had
seen
the
sufferings
of
his
people
and
had
been
sorry
for
them
and
then
he
told
the
boy
what
to
do
so
he
kept
the
boy
there
for
a
little
while
longer
and
gave
him
some
fine
new
clothing
and
weapons
and
then
he
told
one
of
the
warriors
to
send
the
boy
back
and
the
warrior
led
him
out
of
the
lodge
to
where
the
swans
were
standing
near
the
entrance
and
the
boy
got
on
to
their
backs
then
the
warrior
put
his
hand
on
his
face
and
pressed
his
eyelids
together
and
the
boy
went
to
sleep
and
by
and
by
the
boy
awoke
and
found
himself
alone
by
the
fire
the
fire
had
gone
out
but
the
ground
was
still
covered
with
snow
and
it
was
very
cold
now
the
boy
felt
strong
and
he
stood
up
and
started
running
along
the
trail
which
the
camp
had
taken
that
night
after
dark
he
overtook
the
camp
for
they
traveled
very
slowly
and
he
walked
through
the
village
till
he
came
to
the
lodge
where
the
woman
was
and
went
in
she
was
surprised
to
see
him
in
his
new
clothes
and
looking
so
well
and
strong
and
told
him
to
sit
down
there
was
a
little
fire
in
the
lodge
and
the
boy
could
see
that
the
woman
was
cutting
up
something
into
small
pieces
with
her
knife
the
boy
said
to
her
what
are
you
doing
she
answered
i
am
going
to
boil
our
last
piece
of
robe
after
we
have
eaten
this
there
will
be
nothing
left
and
we
can
then
only
die
the
boy
said
nothing
but
watched
her
for
a
little
while
and
then
stood
up
and
went
out
of
the
lodge
the
door
had
hardly
fallen
behind
him
when
the
woman
heard
a
buffalo
coughing
and
then
the
breaking
of
the
crisp
snow
as
if
a
heavy
weight
was
settling
on
it
in
a
moment
the
boy
lifted
the
lodge
door
and
came
in
and
sat
down
by
the
fire
and
said
to
the
woman
go
out
and
bring
in
some
meat
the
woman
looked
at
him
for
she
was
astonished
but
he
said
nothing
so
she
went
out
and
there
in
the
snow
by
the
side
of
the
lodge
was
a
fat
buffalo
cow
then
the
woman
heart
was
glad
she
skinned
the
cow
and
brought
some
of
the
meat
into
the
lodge
and
cooked
it
and
they
all
ate
and
were
satisfied
the
woman
was
good
so
she
sent
her
son
to
the
lodges
of
all
her
relations
and
all
her
friends
and
told
them
all
to
come
next
morning
to
her
lodge
to
a
feast
for
she
said
i
have
plenty
of
meat
so
the
next
morning
all
her
relations
and
all
her
friends
came
so
many
that
they
could
not
all
get
into
the
lodge
but
some
had
to
stand
outside
and
they
ate
with
her
and
she
cooked
the
meat
of
the
cow
for
them
and
they
ate
until
it
was
all
gone
and
they
were
satisfied
and
after
they
had
done
eating
they
lighted
their
pipes
and
prayed
saying
father
you
are
the
ruler
while
they
were
smoking
the
poor
boy
called
the
woman
son
to
him
and
pointed
to
a
high
hill
near
the
camp
and
said
run
hard
to
the
top
of
that
hill
and
tell
me
what
you
see
so
the
boy
threw
off
his
robe
and
smoothed
back
his
hair
and
started
and
ran
as
hard
as
he
could
over
the
snow
to
the
top
of
the
hill
when
he
got
there
he
shaded
his
eyes
with
his
hand
for
the
sun
shone
bright
on
the
snow
and
blinded
him
and
he
looked
east
and
west
and
north
and
south
but
he
could
see
nothing
but
the
shining
white
snow
on
the
prairie
after
he
had
looked
all
ways
he
ran
back
as
hard
as
he
could
to
the
village
when
he
came
to
the
lodge
he
went
to
the
poor
boy
and
said
to
him
i
do
see
anything
but
the
snow
the
poor
boy
said
you
do
look
good
go
again
so
the
boy
started
again
and
ran
as
hard
as
he
could
to
the
hilltop
and
when
he
got
there
panting
he
looked
all
ways
long
and
carefully
but
still
he
could
see
nothing
but
the
snow
so
he
turned
and
ran
back
to
the
village
and
told
the
poor
boy
again
that
he
saw
nothing
the
boy
said
you
do
look
good
then
he
took
his
bow
in
his
hand
and
put
his
quiver
on
his
back
and
drew
his
robe
up
under
his
arm
so
that
he
could
run
well
and
started
himself
and
ran
as
hard
as
he
could
to
the
top
of
the
hill
and
when
he
got
there
he
looked
off
to
the
south
and
there
as
far
as
he
could
see
the
plain
was
black
with
buffalo
struggling
in
the
deep
snow
and
he
turned
to
the
village
and
signaled
them
with
his
robe
that
buffalo
were
in
sight
in
a
few
minutes
all
the
pawnees
had
seized
their
bows
and
arrows
and
were
running
toward
him
and
the
women
fixed
the
and
took
their
knives
and
followed
the
boy
waited
on
the
hilltop
until
the
warriors
came
up
and
then
they
went
down
to
the
buffalo
running
on
the
snow
the
buffalo
could
not
get
away
on
account
of
the
deep
snow
and
the
pawnees
made
a
great
killing
plenty
of
fat
meat
they
got
enough
to
last
them
until
the
summer
hunt
and
plenty
of
warm
winter
robes
they
did
not
have
to
move
any
further
but
stayed
right
here
killing
meat
and
drying
it
until
they
were
all
fat
and
strong
again
and
the
poor
boy
became
a
great
doctor
in
the
tribe
and
got
rich
before
this
the
pawnees
had
always
had
a
woman
chief
but
when
the
woman
who
was
chief
died
she
named
the
poor
boy
as
her
successor
and
the
people
made
him
head
chief
of
the
tribe

how
the
deer
lost
his
gall
a
long
time
ago
the
deer
and
the
antelope
met
upon
the
prairie
at
that
time
both
of
them
had
and
both
had
galls
after
they
had
talked
for
a
little
while
each
one
of
them
began
to
boast
about
how
fast
he
could
run
each
one
the
deer
and
the
antelope
claimed
that
he
could
run
faster
than
any
other
animal
and
at
length
they
became
very
angry
in
their
dispute
and
determined
that
they
would
have
a
race
they
staked
their
galls
on
the
race
and
it
was
run
on
the
prairie
the
antelope
ran
the
faster
and
won
and
took
the
deer
gall
the
deer
felt
very
badly
that
he
had
lost
it
and
he
seemed
so
miserable
that
the
antelope
felt
sorry
for
him
and
to
cheer
him
up
he
took
off
his
and
gave
them
to
him
since
that
time
the
deer
has
had
no
gall
and
the
antelope
no
a
story
somewhat
similar
to
this
is
current
among
the
blackfeet
tribes
of
the
northern
country
in
this
tale
the
antelope
won
the
deer
gall
as
in
the
pawnee
story
then
the
deer
said
you
have
won
but
that
race
was
not
a
fair
one
for
it
was
over
the
prairie
alone
we
ought
to
run
another
race
in
the
timber
to
decide
which
is
really
the
faster
they
agreed
to
run
this
second
race
and
on
it
they
bet

ran
the
faster

the
thick
timber
and
over

a
long
time
ago
while
the

were
on
their

hunt
a
young
boy
yellow
fox
went
out
alone
to
hunt
to
see
if
he
could
kill
a
deer
when
he
left
the
camp
in
the
morning
it
was
warm
and
pleasant
but
in
the
middle
of
the
day
a
great
storm
of
wind
and
snow
came
up
and
the
flying
snow
hid
everything
and
it
grew
very
cold
by
and
by
the
ground
was
covered
with
snow
and
the
whole
look
of
the
prairie
was
changed
and
the
boy
became
lost
and
did
not
know
where
he
was
nor
what
way
to
go
to
get
to
the
camp
all
day
he
walked
but
he
saw
nothing
of
the
camp
nor
of
any
trail
and
as
it
became
colder
and
colder
he
thought
that
he
would
surely
freeze
to
death
he
thought
that
he
must
die
and
that
there
was
no
hope
of
his
ever
seeing
his
people
again
as
he
was
wandering
along
numbed
and
stiffened
by
the
cold
and
stumbling
through
the
deep
snow
he
heard
behind
him
a
curious
singing
sound
and
in
time
with
the
singing
was
the
noise
made
by
some
heavy
animal
running
the
sounds
came
nearer
and
at
last
close
by
the
boy
ran
a
great
big
buffalo
bull
and
as
he
ran
near
the
boy
he
sang
a
song
and
as
he
sang
the
sound
of
his
hoofs
on
the
ground
kept
time
to
the
measure
of
the
song
this
is
what
he
sang
my
father
says
go
on
he
keeps
saying
keep
going
on
it
will
be
well
the
boy
heart
became
strong
when
he
heard
that
the
father
had
sent
the
bull
and
he
followed
him
and
the
bull
led
him

to
the
camp

the
notes
on
the
origin
customs
and
character
of
the
pawnees
which
follow
have
been
gathered
during
twenty
years
acquaintance
with
this
people
they
are
what
they
profess
to
be
not
a
history
of
the
people
but
a
series
of
notes
bearing
on
their
mode
of
life
in
the
old
wild
days
an
attempt
to
give
some
clues
to
their
habits
of
thought
and
thus
to
indicate
the
character
of
the
people
such
notes
may
be
of
use
to
some
future
historian
who
shall
have
the
time
and
the
inclination
to
trace
out
more
fully
the
history
of
the
pawnees
and
to
tell
as
it
ought
to
be
told
the
story
of
a
people
who
once
were
great
i
could
wish
that
it
might
be
my
privilege
to
undertake
this
congenial
task
but
the
constantly
increasing
pressure
of
other
duties
forbids
me
to
hope
that
i
shall
be
able
to
do
so
i
feel
satisfaction
however
in
being
able
to
record
the
observations
here
set
down
in
the
collection
of
this
material
i
had
for
years
the
assistance
and
coöperation
of
the
late
major
frank
north
who
always
placed
at
my
disposal
his
great
store
of
pawnee
lore
luther
north
his
brother
has
given
me
a
vast
deal
of
assistance
and
last
spring
accompanied
me
to
the
pawnee
reservation
without
his
aid
this
book
would
never
have
been
written
john
dunbar
has
been
most
kind
in
reading
over
the
chapter
on
the
pawnees
and
has
aided
me
with
many
suggestions
besides
giving
me
help
on
certain
linguistic
points
nothing
is
said
in
this
volume
about
the
pawnee
language
a
subject
which
is
sufficiently
important
to
deserve
a
volume
by
itself
to
every
intelligent
student
of
north
american
aborigines
it
must
be
a
matter
of
keen
regret
that
nothing
is
known
of
the
language
of
this
people
that
a
distinct
linguistic
stock
like
the
pawnee
should
pass
away
unrecorded
would
be
a
serious
misfortune
and
the
bureau
of
ethnology
of
the
smithsonian
institution
ought
certainly
to
take
some
steps
to
preserve
a
record
of
the
pawnee
language
major
frank
north
was
undoubtedly
more
conversant
with
the
spoken
pawnee
tongue
than
any
other
white
man
has
ever
been
since
his
death
there
is
no
one
who
is
so
familiar
with
the
language
as
john
dunbar
who
has
devoted
much
time
to
its
study
and
has
made
himself
acquainted
not
only
with
its
vocabulary
but
also
with
its
grammar
born
and
reared
among
the
pawnees
familiar
with
them
until
early
manhood
a
frequent
visitor
to
the
tribe
in
later
years
he
is
well
fitted
by
interest
and
association
to
undertake
the
task
of
recording
in
permanent
form
the
unwritten
speech
of
this
people
add
to
this
a
long
training
as
a
student
of
language
and
history
and
a
keen
logical
mind
and
we
have
in
dunbar
the
man
more
than
all
others
best
fitted
to
undertake
this
difficult
but
most
delightful
task
the
director
of
the
bureau
of
ethnology
could
not
easily
perform
a
greater
service
to
aboriginal
linguistics
than
to
intrust
to
dunbar
the
labor
of
preparing
an
extended
work
on
the
pawnee
language
the
pawnees
i
relationships
until
within
a
few
years
the
home
of
the
pawnees
was
in
southern
nebraska
and
northern
kansas
this
group
of
tribes
may
be
called
the
main
stock
of
the
family
from
them
it
took
its
name
they
are
its
best
and
longest
known
members
in
the
earlier
accounts
of
this
people
the
pawnee
picts
or
wichitas
are
often
confounded
with
their
more
northern
relatives
the
pawnees
proper
consisted
at
one
time
of
three
bands
or
tribes
federated
under
a
single
head
chief
these
bands
in
the
order
of
their
importance
were
the
the
and
the
to
these
three
was
subsequently
added
after
the
northern
migration
of
the
tribes
and
their
settlement
in
northern
kansas
and
nebraska
but
probably
long
anterior
to
the
advent
of
the
whites
and
by
conquest
the
large
powerful
and
intelligent
allied
tribe
known
as
the
skidi
or
pawnee
loups
these
four
have
always
been
known
in
the
writings
of
the
earlier
explorers
in
the
west
as
respectively
the
grand
the
republican
the
tapage
and
the
wolf
pawnees
and
they
constituted
the
pawnee
nation
the
three
tribes
first
named
have
always
been
together
and
their
pawnee
names
according
to
major
north
denoted
the
relative
situations
of
the
three
villages
thus
means
on
a
hill
in
the
middle
down
the
stream
or
east
and
in
the
olden
times
these
were
the
relative
positions
of
the
different
villages
when
the
three
bands
were
camping
together
the
village
was
always
the
westernmost
of
the
three
the
were
next
to
them
and
the
were
furthest
east
after
the
incorporation
of
the
skidi
with
the
pawnees
the
village
of
that
tribe
was
always
placed
furthest
to
the
west
and
it
was
spoken
of
as
the
upper
village
while
the
other
bands
were
termed
the
lower
village
tribes
illustration
good
chief
of
the
three
original
bands
the
has
always
been
first
in
importance
and
the
head
chief
has
been
chosen
from
it
the
band
in
numbers
importance
and
intelligence
appear
to
rank
about
with
the
while
on
the
other
hand
the
are
regarded
as
less
intelligent
responsible
and
worthy
than
the
other
bands
the
skidi
are
usually
looked
upon
as
more
intelligent
than
the
pawnees
and
also
as
fiercer
in
their
nature
and
as
making
better
soldiers
the
skidi
traditions
though
such
testimony
of
course
is
not
of
much
value
speak
rather
contemptuously
of
the
prowess
of
the
other
bands
in
war
and
the
superiority
of
the
skidi
is
grudgingly
acknowledged
by
the
others
this
is
contrary
to
the
view
held
by
j
dunbar
who
speaks
of
the
skidi
as
more
intelligent
than
the
other
bands
but
as
not
being
so
good
as
warriors
besides
this
main
group
of
tribes
the
members
of
the
pawnee
family
as
given
by
dunbar
are
the
arickaras
known
also
as
the
arickarees
ricarees
or
rees
the
caddos
the
huecos
or
wacos
the
keechies
the
tawaconies
and
the
wichitas
or
pawnee
picts
to
these
may
be
added
with
some
confidence
the
tonkaways
and
the
lipans
the
caddos
huecos
keechies
and
tawaconies
are
regarded
by
the
pawnees
as
closely
connected
with
the
wichitas
they
had
but
one
name
for
all
these
tribes
and
knew
no
distinction
between
them
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
arickaras
were
recently
perhaps
within
a
century
either
a
band
of
the
skidi
tribe
or
at
least
allied
to
them
as
closely
as
the
have
always
been
to
the
and
the
the
relationship
of
the
tonkaways
and
the
lipans
has
only
recently
been
discovered
and
has
come
to
light
through
the
removal
of
the
pawnees
from
their
home
in
nebraska
to
their
present
reservation
in
the
indian
territory
in
a
note
appended
to
his
article
on
the
pawnees
published
in
the
of
american
for
november
dunbar
says
a
friend
who
has
had
much
experience
with
the
indians
of
the
southwest
informs
me
that
he
is
inclined
to
believe
that
the
lipans
of
mexico
are
of
pawnee
stock
they
have
in
times
past
exchanged
frequent
hospitalities
with
the
wichitas
or
pawnee
picts
and
the
two
understand
each
other
dialects
readily
the
name
lipans
he
explains
as
that
is
pawnees
while
this
suggestion
is
very
interesting
so
far
as
it
goes
it
scarcely
furnishes
sufficient
ground
on
which
to
base
a
genetic
connection
of
the
lipans
with
the
pawnee
family
i
have
recently
secured
additional
and
more
satisfactory
evidence
of
such
a
connection
it
is
generally
believed
by
the
pawnees
especially
by
those
who
are
most
intelligent
and
have
had
most
intercourse
with
the
southern
tribes
that
the
lipans
are
allied
to
them
and
that
this
relationship
is
traceable
through
the
wichitas
and
the
tonkaways
the
evidence
consists
of
statements
by
the
wichitas
and
tonkaways
an
alleged
similarity
of
language
and
personal
names
and
a
similarity
in
the
songs
of
the
tribes
a
pawnee
indian
who
has
lived
for
seven
seasons
with
the
wichitas
gave
me
the
following
story
which
he
had
gathered
from
that
people
they
say
that
long
ago
they
did
not
know
the
tonkaways
but
that
when
the
tribes
met
they
found
that
they
could
understand
each
other
speech
their
languages
were
not
the
same
but
they
were
not
more
unlike
than
were
the
tongues
spoken
by
the
skidi
and
the
three
other
pawnee
bands
long
ago
in
other
words
they
were
dialects
of
the
same
language
after
that
meeting
the
tonkaways
and
the
wichitas
lived
together
for
a
time
but
the
tonkaways
had
bad
ways
they
would
eat
human
flesh
when
they
could
find
a
wichita
boy
out
away
from
the
camp
they
would
capture
him
and
strangle
and
eat
him
sometimes
they
would
kill
a
man
of
the
wichitas
if
they
could
catch
him
away
off
on
the
prairie
therefore
the
wichitas
drove
the
tonkaways
off
south
and
soon
afterward
moved
up
across
the
arkansas
river
and
into
southern
kansas
since
then
the
wichitas
and
the
tonkaways
have
never
lived
together
a
tonkaway
chief
named
charlie
told
ralph
j
weeks
an
educated
pawnee
i
have
heard
that
my
people
are
pawnees
but
that
we
separated
long
ago
i
am
informed
that
the
personal
names
of
the
tonkaways
are
the
same
as
those
of
the
pawnees
and
are
readily
comprehended
by
the
latter
ralph
weeks
while
in
a
tonkaway
lodge
heard
a
man
call
out
to
a
girl
addressing
her
as
which
means
woman
chief
house
ralph
inquired
about
this
name
and
found
that
it
was
the
same
in
sound
as
pawnee
and
had
the
same
meaning
the
tonkaways
say
that
some
of
the
pawnee
words
are
the
same
as
those
used
by
their
relations
to
the
south
the
lipans
and
others
the
songs
of
the
tonkaways
are
the
same
as
those
of
the
pawnees
and
the
latter
at
once
recognize
them
the
old
songs
of
the
lipans
are
the
same
as
those
of
the
pawnees
according
to
both
pawnee
and
tonkaway
testimony
finally
the
tonkaways
and
lipans
claim
close
relationship
they
speak
different
dialects
of
the
same
language
the
pawnees
however
say
that
they
never
knew
of
the
existence
of
the
tonkaways
until
they
came
down
into
the
indian
territory
and
of
course
never
met
them
until
after
that
time
neither
did
they
know
the
caddos
as
the
pawnees
knew
nothing
of
the
caddos
and
tonkaways
so
the
wichitas
knew
nothing
of
the
arickaras
until
recently
and
were
greatly
surprised
to
learn
that
far
to
the
north
there
was
another
tribe
which
spoke
their
language
the
wichitas
claim
that
they
and
the
caddos
are
one
people
their
languages
are
said
to
differ
somewhat
but
only
dialectically
the
southern
members
of
the
pawnee
family
appear
always
to
have
lived
on
excellent
terms
with
the
other
wild
tribes
which
inhabited
their
country
they
were
allies
of
the
kiowas
comanches
and
cheyennes
tribes
with
which
the
northern
pawnees
were
long
at
war
ii
origin
and
migrations
the
pawnees
came
from
the
south
all
the
information
bearing
on
their
origin
which
has
as
yet
been
secured
points
to
the
conclusion
that
the
primitive
home
of
this
family
was
in
the
south
although
dunbar
has
carefully
traced
out
the
later
history
of
several
of
the
members
of
this
group
his
researches
carry
us
back
scarcely
further
than
the
beginning
of
the
present
century
and
we
have
no
actual
knowledge
of
the
origin
and
early
history
of
the
pawnees
except
the
arickaras
none
of
the
tribes
belonging
to
this
family
have
ever
dwelt
much
north
of
the
platte
river
and
in
this
we
have
an
indication
of
their
southern
origin
the
traditions
of
the
tribe
confirm
this
suggestion
and
dunbar
has
given
other
reasons
derived
from
his
study
of
this
people
which
abundantly
justify
us
in
regarding
them
as
migrants
from
the
south
there
are
still
current
among
the
pawnees
two
traditions
as
to
the
region
from
which
they
came
but
both
of
these
are
vague
and
so
lacking
in
detail
as
to
be
of
little
value
except
as
suggestions
which
need
confirmation
before
being
accepted
as
having
any
solid
basis
of
fact
the
first
of
these
traditions
now
half
forgotten
is
known
only
to
the
very
oldest
men
it
is
to
the
effect
that
long
ago
they
came
from
the
far
southwest
where
they
used
to
live
in
stone
houses
this
might
point
to
an
original
home
for
the
pawnees
in
old
mexico
and
even
suggests
a
possible
connection
with
the
pueblo
tribes
who
still
live
in
houses
made
of
stone
and
entered
from
above
secret
pipe
chief
a
very
old
the
high
priest
of
the
tribe
gave
me
the
history
of
their
wanderings
in
these
words
long
ago
he
said
very
far
back
all
of
one
color
were
together
but
something
mysterious
happened
so
that
they
came
to
speak
different
languages
they
were
all
together
and
determined
that
they
would
separate
into
different
parties
to
go
and
get
sinew
they
could
not
all
go
in
company
there
were
too
many
of
them
they
were
so
numerous
that
when
they
traveled
the
rocks
where
their
lodge
poles
dragged
were
worn
into
deep
grooves
then
they
were
far
off
in
the
southwest
and
came
from
beyond
two
ranges
of
mountains
when
they
scattered
out
each
party
became
a
tribe
at
that
time
the
pawnees
and
the
wichitas
were
together
we
made
that
journey
and
went
so
far
east
that
at
last
we
came
to
the
missouri
river
and
stopped
there
for
a
time
when
the
season
came
round
we
made
out
of
the
shoulder
blade
of
a
buffalo
an
implement
to
cultivate
the
ground
there
we
made
our
fields
another
very
old
man
bear
chief
a
skidi
said
long
ago
we
were
far
in
the
southwest
away
beyond
the
rio
grande
we
came
north
and
settled
near
the
wichita
mountains
one
summer
there
we
planted
our
corn
so
we
came
from
the
south
after
we
left
the
wichita
mountains
that
summer
we
came
north
as
far
as
the
arkansas
river
and
made
our
fields
and
raised
corn
afterward
we
went
to
the
mississippi
river
where
the
missouri
runs
into
it
my
father
was
born
while
we
lived
on
the
mississippi
as
bear
chief
must
be
nearly
or
quite
eighty
years
old
it
would
seem
likely
that
the
skidi
or
some
village
of
that
tribe
may
have
been
established
on
the
mississippi
one
hundred
years
ago
but
this
was
not
a
permanent
location
the
second
of
these
traditions
tells
of
a
migration
from
the
southeast
it
states
that
the
tribe
originally
came
from
somewhere
in
the
southeast
that
is
from
what
is
now
missouri
or
arkansas
they
started
north
after
sinew
to
hunt
buffalo
and
followed
up
the
game
until
they
reached
the
northern
country
the
region
of
the
republican
and
the
platte
rivers
they
found
this
a
pleasant
country
abounding
in
game
and
they
liked
it
and
remained
there
the
wichitas
accompanied
them
part
way
on
their
journey
but
turned
aside
when
they
had
reached
southern
kansas
and
went
south
again
all
the
traditions
agree
that
up
to
the
time
of
the
journey
which
brought
the
pawnees
to
their
homes
on
the
solomon
republican
platte
and
loup
rivers
the
wichitas
were
considered
a
part
of
the
pawnee
tribe
they
agree
also
that
after
this
separation
the
two
divisions
of
the
tribe
lost
sight
of
each
other
for
a
very
long
time
and
that
each
was
entirely
ignorant
as
to
what
had
become
of
the
other
we
know
that
for
a
long
time
they
were
at
war
and
the
difference
of
the
dialects
spoken
by
these
two
divisions
of
the
family
shows
that
the
period
of
separation
was
a
long
one
the
tradition
of
the
migration
of
the
pawnees
from
the
southwest
is
evidently
much
older
than
the
one
which
tells
of
their
coming
from
the
southeast
most
of
the
younger
men
know
the
latter
but
for
the
account
of
the
journey
over
the
mountains
from
the
southwest
and
across
the
rio
grande
it
is
necessary
to
go
to
the
very
old
men
it
is
quite
possible
that
both
stories
are
founded
on
fact
and
if
this
is
the
case
the
migration
from
the
southeast
may
have
taken
place
only
a
few
generations
ago
such
a
supposition
would
in
part
explain
its
general
currency
at
the
present
time
in
the
existing
state
of
our
knowledge
of
this
people
we
have
no
facts
to
go
on
nothing
in
the
nature
of
evidence
as
to
their
early
history
and
we
can
only
speculate
as
to
the
probabilities
in
regard
to
their
wanderings
it
may
be
conjectured
that
the
pawnees
came
from
somewhere
in
old
mexico
and
either
as
a
number
of
related
tribes
or
as
a
single
tribe
made
up
of
different
bands
they
crossed
the
mountains
and
the
rio
grande
in
a
body
and
wandered
eastward
across
what
is
now
texas
from
this
body
it
seems
probable
that
the
ancestors
of
the
lipans
and
the
tonkaways
were
the
first
to
separate
themselves
the
main
tribe
perhaps
gradually
drifted
further
and
further
to
the
east
until
it
had
crossed
texas
and
reached
northwestern
louisiana
and
perhaps
even
the
neighborhood
of
the
mississippi
river
during
this
long
journey
which
must
have
occupied
many
years
perhaps
many
generations
we
may
imagine
that
the
huecos
and
possibly
the
keechies
dropped
behind
and
remained
on
the
plains
how
long
the
pawnees
sojourned
in
louisiana
no
one
can
say
they
now
found
themselves
in
a
country
which
in
climate
productions
and
topography
differed
widely
from
anything
they
had
before
known
up
to
this
time
these
people
had
always
inhabited
the
high
dry
tablelands
of
mexico
or
the
almost
equally
arid
plains
of
texas
and
now
they
had
come
to
a
country
having
a
heavy
rainfall
abounding
in
swamps
and
overgrown
with
deciduous
timber
the
traditions
of
both
skidi
and
pawnees
speak
of
a
time
when
they
lived
in
a
country
where
grows
the
cane
which
the
white
men
use
for
fishing
poles
we
may
imagine
that
this
forest
country
was
a
barrier
to
their
further
progress
eastward
and
that
it
turned
their
steps
in
a
new
direction
when
the
pawnees
left
louisiana
the
caddos
certainly
and
perhaps
the
keechies
and
the
tawaconies
were
left
behind
and
for
a
very
long
time
lived
in
and
near
what
is
now
caddo
parish
louisiana
where
they
were
at
the
time
of
the
louisiana
purchase
geographical
names
in
this
region
indicate
that
their
residence
there
was
a
long
one
and
caddo
lake
caddo
fork
caddo
gap
and
a
town
named
keatchie
still
bear
testimony
of
the
former
occupants
of
the
soil
from
there
the
caddos
moved
up
to
the
brazos
river
in
texas
they
have
always
kept
up
a
close
intimacy
with
the
wichitas
perhaps
it
was
during
the
sojourn
of
the
pawnees
on
the
western
borders
of
louisiana
and
arkansas
though
it
may
have
been
much
earlier
that
the
skidi
and
the
arickaras
either
as
a
single
tribe
or
as
already
divided
into
two
separate
bands
left
the
pawnees
and
moved
north
and
northwest
there
appears
to
be
reason
for
supposing
that
for
a
while
this
section
of
the
tribe
lived
on
the
red
river
the
canadian
and
the
arkansas
and
it
is
quite
certain
that
sometimes
they
went
as
far
east
as
the
banks
of
the
mississippi
near
where
louis
now
is
but
their
permanent
home
since
they
have
been
known
to
the
whites
was
on
the
platte
and
the
loup
rivers
in
nebraska
the
pawnees
with
the
wichitas
moved
northwest
into
what
is
now
the
indian
territory
and
southern
kansas
where
they
separated
the
latter
turning
off
to
the
south
and
living
at
various
times
on
the
canadian
and
red
rivers
and
near
the
wichita
mountains
while
the
pawnees
proper
slowly
continued
their
march
northward
and
westward
residing
for
a
time
on
the
arkansas
and
solomon
the
republican
and
platte
rivers
here
they
again
met
the
skidi
it
is
impossible
to
conjecture
when
this
settlement
in
the
northern
country
took
place
but
it
was
certainly
long
ago
dunbar
has
pointed
out
that
and
signify
strictly
above
and
below
of
a
stream
respectively
now
their
villages
have
usually
been
situated
upon
the
banks
of
the
platte
the
general
course
of
which
is
from
west
to
east
hence
each
of
these
words
has
acquired
a
new
meaning
west
and
east
in
the
same
way
toward
the
omahas
has
come
to
mean
north
and
toward
the
wichitas
to
mean
south
the
coining
of
such
words
points
to
a
long
sojourn
by
the
pawnees
in
the
region
of
the
platte
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
the
omahas
have
never
in
historic
times
lived
north
of
the
pawnees
but
always
east
of
them
though
we
know
that
long
ago
they
did
live
to
the
north
these
remarks
on
the
movements
of
the
pawnees
are
to
be
sure
very
largely
speculative
but
speculation
guided
by
the
hints
gathered
from
conversations
with
the
older
men
it
is
a
surmise
as
to
what
may
have
been
the
wanderings
of
these
people
if
it
were
possible
to
talk
with
all
the
different
tribes
of
the
family
something
more
definite
might
be
reached
but
at
this
late
day
this
seems
hopeless
a
study
of
the
lipans
and
an
investigation
of
their
relationships
with
other
southwestern
tribes
might
furnish
us
clues
of
the
utmost
importance
in
tracing
the
origin
of
the
pawnee
family
iii
the
skidi
ranking
high
among
the
pawnee
bands
for
their
intelligence
energy
and
courage
stand
the
skidi
their
past
history
is
obscure
and
we
know
little
about
it
beyond
the
fact
that
it
was
different
from
that
of
the
other
bands
although
the
relationship
between
them
is
perfectly
well
established
still
both
pawnee
and
skidi
traditions
agree
that
the
two
tribes
were
originally
distinct
and
that
their
first
meeting
took
place
long
ago
but
after
the
migration
of
the
pawnees
to
the
northern
country
we
know
too
that
the
arickaras
were
close
neighbors
and
near
relatives
of
the
skidi
and
it
is
probable
that
they
constituted
a
band
village
or
division
of
that
tribe
it
is
believed
by
those
who
should
be
well
informed
that
the
northward
migration
of
the
rees
took
place
not
more
than
a
century
ago
one
tradition
of
the
separation
runs
in
this
way
the
skidi
started
out
on
a
hunt
a
part
going
ahead
and
the
others
following
later
the
first
party
were
killing
buffalo
when
they
were
attacked
by
a
large
war
party
of
sioux
these
got
between
the
two
parties
of
the
skidi
driving
one
of
them
back
to
the
village
while
the
other
retreated
northward
this
retreat
continued
until
they
had
been
driven
some
distance
up
the
missouri
river
where
their
enemies
left
them
they
remained
there
through
the
winter
and
planted
their
corn
in
the
spring
nor
did
they
apparently
for
some
time
make
any
attempt
to
rejoin
their
tribe
after
some
years
however
the
two
bands
came
together
on
the
loup
and
for
a
time
lived
together
the
rees
even
went
further
south
to
the
neighborhood
of
the
wichita
mountains
where
the
pawnees
at
that
time
were
living
but
soon
afterward
they
went
north
again
and
rejoined
the
skidi
on
the
loup
and
lived
near
them
there
and
on
the
platte
near
scott
bluffs
it
was
not
long
however
before
a
disagreement
arose
between
the
rees
and
the
skidi
and
the
rees
again
moved
off
north
it
is
probable
that
this
quarrel
may
have
originated
in
the
fact
that
the
rees
wished
to
make
war
on
the
whites
but
there
is
some
reason
to
believe
that
there
was
also
jealousy
about
the
head
chieftainship
of
the
two
bands
the
testimony
of
men
still
living
indicates
that
about
one
hundred
years
ago
some
of
the
skidi
lived
on
the
mississippi
river
near
the
present
site
of
louis
and
it
is
said
that
it
was
only
the
coming
in
of
the
white
settlers
in
considerable
numbers
that
caused
them
to
move
further
westward
i
am
inclined
to
regard
this
location
as
only
a
temporary
one
and
to
believe
that
their
real
home
prior
to
this
had
been
to
the
west
on
the
platte
and
loup
rivers
it
is
of
course
impossible
to
fix
even
approximately
the
time
when
the
pawnees
and
the
skidi
came
together
but
it
probably
was
soon
after
the
pawnees
had
settled
on
the
republican
in
their
northward
migration
it
is
said
that
their
first
meeting
was
friendly
and
that
they
made
a
treaty
and
smoked
together
but
no
peace
between
two
such
warlike
tribes
could
last
very
long
and
there
were
frequent
collisions
and
disagreements
there
was
a
sharp
rivalry
between
the
and
the
skidi
and
their
disputes
finally
culminated
in
an
unprovoked
attack
by
the
skidi
upon
some
pawnees
while
they
were
hunting
buffalo
in
which
about
one
hundred
of
the
latter
were
killed
the
pawnees
made
ready
to
avenge
this
injury
and
marshaled
all
their
forces
they
made
a
night
march
to
the
vicinity
of
the
skidi
village
which
is
said
to
have
been
on
the
north
side
of
the
loup
distant
from
their
own
only
about
twenty
miles
and
just
at
daylight
sent
out
about
one
hundred
warriors
all
mounted
on
dark
colored
horses
to
decoy
the
skidi
from
the
village
these
men
lying
down
on
their
horses
and
covering
themselves
with
their
robes
represented
buffalo
and
rode
over
the
hill
in
sight
of
the
skidi
village
the
ruse
was
successful
the
skidi
at
once
started
out
to
kill
the
buffalo
leaving
their
village
unprotected
the
disguised
warriors
fled
leading
the
skidi
further
away
while
the
pawnees
who
were
in
reserve
rushed
into
the
defenseless
village
and
captured
it
almost
without
striking
a
blow
they
took
all
the
inhabitants
back
with
them
to
their
own
village
the
skidi
were
forced
to
sue
for
peace
and
for
their
breach
of
faith
were
heavily
fined
by
the
victorious
pawnees
they
were
incorporated
into
the
tribe
and
since
that
time
have
lived
as
a
part
of
the
pawnee
nation
this
event
was
probably
the
culminating
point
of
a
series
of
petty
fights
and
skirmishes
which
must
have
been
annoying
to
the
pawnees
this
fighting
went
on
within
the
memory
of
men
now
living
though
there
are
but
few
who
are
old
enough
to
remember
it
curly
chief
who
is
about
years
old
can
remember
a
man
who
took
part
in
these
wars
and
whose
name
was
bear
chief
a
very
old
and
decrepit
skidi
and
secret
pipe
chief
an
old
have
both
told
me
that
they
can
remember
one
or
more
fights
between
the
skidi
and
the
other
bands
a
rather
interesting
evidence
of
the
feeling
once
existing
between
the
skidi
and
the
other
bands
and
even
now
surviving
among
some
of
the
oldest
men
is
the
statement
by
bear
chief
that
the
three
other
bands
were
known
as
big
shields
the
implication
being
that
as
they
hid
themselves
behind
these
big
shields
they
were
not
so
brave
as
those
who
used
smaller
ones
the
existence
of
such
a
feeling
at
the
present
day
indicates
that
the
final
conquest
of
the
skidi
and
their
incorporation
into
the
pawnee
tribe
took
place
not
very
long
ago
dunbar
sums
up
the
traditions
of
the
meeting
of
the
tribes
their
wars
and
subsequent
union
in
the
following
language
the
historic
basis
of
this
may
be
somewhat
as
follows
in
the
migration
of
the
pawnees
from
the
south
the
skidi
preceded
the
other
bands
perhaps
by
nearly
a
century
with
them
were
the
arickaras
these
two
bands
together
possessed
themselves
of
the
region
of
the
loup
when
the
other
bands
arrived
they
were
regarded
as
intruders
and
hence
arose
open
hostilities
the
result
of
the
struggle
was
that
the
two
bands
were
forced
to
admit
the
new
comers
and
aid
in
reducing
the
surrounding
territory
subsequently
the
arickaras
seem
to
have
wandered
or
more
probably
to
have
been
driven
from
the
confederacy
and
to
have
passed
up
the
missouri
later
the
skidi
in
consequence
of
some
real
or
fancied
provocation
attempted
to
retrieve
their
losses
but
were
sorely
punished
and
henceforth
obliged
to
content
themselves
with
a
subordinate
position
in
the
tribe
it
is
said
that
in
the
olden
time
the
skidi
were
very
powerful
the
tribe
was
made
up
of
four
bands
or
villages
each
of
which
numbered
people
or
for
the
whole
tribe
this
estimate
which
is
founded
merely
on
the
statements
of
old
men
now
living
is
probably
excessive
there
is
no
doubt
however
that
they
were
a
large
and
powerful
tribe
while
their
warlike
habits
and
fierce
natures
caused
them
to
be
feared
and
hated
by
all
their
neighbors
the
four
divisions
of
the
skidi
tribe
exist
now
only
in
name
and
the
origin
of
these
names
is
almost
forgotten
as
the
result
of
much
effort
and
inquiry
i
have
secured
the
following
list
of
the
skidi
pumpkin
vine
village
this
name
is
said
to
have
come
from
the
fact
that
once
after
planting
time
this
band
went
off
on
the
summer
hunt
and
while
they
were
away
the
pumpkin
vines
grew
so
luxuriantly
that
they
climbed
up
over
the
lodges
covering
and
hiding
them
wolves
in
the
pools
of
water
the
name
originated
in
this
way
long
ago
one
band
of
the
skidi
were
camped
on
the
loup
river
it
was
winter
and
the
buffalo
came
to
them
in
great
numbers
they
killed
many
and
prepared
great
quantities
of
dried
meat
the
buffalo
kept
coming
and
at
length
they
had
so
much
meat
that
they
had
room
for
no
more
when
they
could
no
longer
store
dried
meat
they
stopped
taking
the
flesh
of
the
buffalo
and
took
only
the
hides
the
buffalo
continued
to
come
and
to
cross
the
river
just
below
the
camp
and
the
men
on
foot
would
chase
the
buffalo
on
the
ice
where
the
great
animals
would
slip
and
sprawl
so
that
the
skidi
could
run
up
close
and
stab
them
they
would
skin
them
there
and
leave
the
carcasses
on
the
ice
from
far
and
near
great
numbers
of
wolves
gathered
to
feed
on
the
carcasses
and
as
it
was
toward
spring
and
the
weather
was
growing
milder
the
ice
began
to
melt
on
top
and
little
pools
of
water
stood
on
it
about
this
time
there
came
to
this
village
a
skidi
from
another
band
who
were
half
starving
for
they
could
find
no
buffalo
at
all
when
the
man
saw
that
this
village
had
so
much
meat
he
wondered
at
the
plenty
and
asked
how
it
was
they
took
him
out
from
the
village
down
to
where
the
dead
buffalo
lay
on
the
ice
and
pointed
them
out
to
him
and
he
saw
the
wolves
standing
in
the
water
and
feeding
on
the
carcasses
then
they
took
him
back
to
the
village
gave
him
all
the
dried
meat
he
could
carry
and
sent
him
away
to
his
home
heavily
loaded
when
he
reached
his
own
village
he
told
the
people
there
how
those
in
the
other
camp
had
plenty
and
when
they
asked
him
where
it
was
he
told
them
and
said
that
it
was
where
the
wolves
stand
in
the
pools
of
water
village
on
a
ridge
village
the
central
roach
on
the
head
of
a
man
whose
hair
has
been
shaved
on
both
sides
curving
over
this
village
was
on
a
ridge
reaching
over
on
both
sides
of
it
village
on
a
point
or
peninsula
village
camp
or
band
a
point
there
are
yet
to
be
seen
on
the
loup
fork
in
nebraska
innumerable
remains
of
skidi
villages
some
of
which
are
very
ancient
iv
name
and
emblem
it
is
probable
that
the
name
pawnee
as
dunbar
has
remarked
is
an
abbreviated
form
of
the
word
which
means
a
horn
and
referred
to
the
peculiar
erect
scalp
lock
which
may
once
have
been
worn
by
this
tribe
as
dunbar
says
the
name
probably
once
embraced
the
pawnee
picts
or
wichitas
among
whom
this
fashion
of
wearing
the
hair
seems
to
have
persisted
long
after
it
had
been
abandoned
by
the
pawnees
the
same
writer
gives
the
name
arickara
as
from
a
horn
with
a
verbal
or
plural
suffix
being
thus
simply
a
later
and
exact
equivalent
of
itself
the
name
pawnee
picts
so
commonly
applied
to
the
wichitas
appears
to
mean
pawnee
picked
or
tattooed
pawnees
and
refers
to
the
markings
upon
the
faces
and
breasts
of
these
people
which
are
picked
in
with
a
sharp
instrument
the
northern
indians
speak
of
the
pawnees
as
while
the
southern
tribes
call
them
and
the
dakotas
call
the
arickaras
all
these
appear
to
be
merely
attempts
to
reproduce
the
name
by
which
the
pawnees
call
themselves
the
english
names
of
the
four
bands
of
the
pawnees
are
as
has
been
already
stated
for
the
skidi
the
wolf
for
the
the
grand
for
the
the
republican
and
for
the
the
tapaje
pawnees
an
old
french
trader
who
has
known
these
people
for
many
years
states
that
the
skidi
are
called
wolf
pawnees
from
the
river
loup
on
which
they
lived
that
grand
is
an
abbreviation
for
because
the
were
mostly
tall
men
and
took
long
steps
that
the
were
called
republican
from
the
river
of
that
name
and
the
fr
noisy
because
they
are
noisy
and
restless
and
are
continually
moving
about
from
place
to
place
this
explanation
of
these
english
names
is
not
altogether
satisfactory
dunbar
informs
me
that
he
believes
that
the
were
called
grand
from
the
appellation
given
them
by
the
spaniards
who
called
them
referring
to
their
physical
stature
in
the
chapter
on
the
skidi
the
names
of
the
four
bands
of
that
tribe
have
been
given
and
their
origin
and
derivation
the
other
tribes
were
divided
into
bands
or
gentes
but
these
divisions
have
almost
been
forgotten
of
the
there
is
now
said
to
be
only
one
band
of
the
three
the
great
little
and
blackhead
while
of
the
there
were
two
bands
the
proper
and
the
this
division
appears
to
have
had
some
customs
peculiar
to
itself
and
quite
different
from
anything
known
to
the
other
pawnees
the
pawnees
call
the
wichitas
and
the
other
related
southern
tribes
the
reason
for
this
appellation
is
obscure
the
only
explanation
of
it
that
i
have
been
able
to
obtain
is
that
when
the
pawnees
first
saw
the
wichitas
they
thought
they
had
eyes
like
a
bear
as
dunbar
has
suggested
to
me
the
allusion
may
have
been
to
the
ring
sometimes
painted
or
tattooed
about
the
eyes
of
the
wichitas
it
is
generally
supposed
that
an
indian
receives
his
personal
name
from
some
peculiarly
memorable
act
that
he
has
performed
or
from
some
incident
that
has
happened
to
him
this
is
not
now
commonly
the
case
in
the
tribes
with
which
i
am
best
acquainted
personal
names
formerly
originated
in
this
way
among
the
indians
but
at
the
present
day
i
question
much
if
they
are
often
given
for
such
reasons
most
of
the
names
borne
by
the
warriors
have
been
long
known
in
the
tribe
and
i
believe
the
coining
of
new
names
to
fit
a
special
set
of
circumstances
to
be
now
quite
unusual
children
were
named
soon
after
they
were
born
and
retained
their
childish
names
until
well
grown
white
was
a
common
boy
name
as
was
black
bright
eyes
was
often
given
to
little
girls
nicknames
referring
to
personal
peculiarities
were
common
here
is
a
list
which
will
give
some
notion
of
the
general
character
of
the
pawnee
names
lucky

good
fox

dunbar
states
that
the
tribal
mark
of
the
pawnees
in
their
pictographic
or
historic
painting
was
the
scalp
lock
dressed
to
stand
nearly
erect
or
curving
slightly
backward
something
like
a
horn
i
have
never
met
a
pawnee
who
knew
of
this
manner
of
dressing
the
hair
in
his
own
tribe
but
all
unite
in
stating
that
the
wichitas
used
to
wear
the
lock
in
this
manner
if
this
is
the
case
no
doubt
in
ancient
times
it
was
common
to
the
pawnees
as
well
but
with
them
it
has
become
obsolete
and
is
now
forgotten
in
books
the
sign
for
pawnee
is
sometimes
given
as
the
forefinger
of
the
right
hand
held
at
the
back
of
the
crown
of
the
head
and
pointing
upward
to
represent
this
erect
scalp
lock
but
i
conceive
that
this
sign
is
really
that
of
the
pawnee
picts
or
wichitas
who
have
been
so
constantly
confused
with
the
true
or
northern
pawnees
illustration
sign
for
pawnee
the
only
sign
for
pawnee
that
i
have
ever
seen
employed
among
indians
in
the
west
is
that
for
wolf
which
is
the
name
under
which
the
pawnees
are
or
at
least
were
formerly
known
to
most
other
tribes
this
sign
is
made
in
two
ways
by
holding
the
two
hands
palm
forward
the
first
and
middle
fingers
extended
close
together
upward
and
a
little
forward
thumb
and
other
fingers
closed
close
to
the
head
about
opposite
the
temple
the
right
hand
alone
may
be
held
palm
forward
at
the
height
of
and
just
in
front
of
the
shoulder
the
first
and
middle
fingers
extended
separated
and
pointing
upward
the
thumb
and
others
closed
the
hand
is
then
moved
forward
and
downward
from
the
wrist
so
that
the
extended
fingers
point
almost
to
the
front
both
these
signs
represent
the
pricked
ears
of
a
wolf
and
so
far
as
my
experience
goes
are
universally
understood
to
mean
pawnee
the
one
last
described
is
now
much
the
more
common
of
the
two
the
first
of
these
signs
is
shown
in
the
frontispiece
which
is
copied
from
an
engraving
in
the
first
annual
report
of
the
bureau
of
ethnology
the
pawnees
have
always
been
called
by
their
neighbors
to
the
south
wolves
it
has
been
suggested
that
this
term
was
applied
to
them
by
their
enemies
in
contempt
but
there
seems
no
reason
for
believing
this
to
have
been
the
case
since
it
may
be
doubted
that
an
indian
feels
contempt
for
a
wolf
any
more
than
he
does
for
a
fox
a
rabbit
or
an
elk
an
indian
going
into
an
enemy
country
is
often
called
a
wolf
and
the
sign
for
a
scout
is
made
up
of
the
signs
wolf
and
look
the
pawnees
were
most
adroit
scouts
warriors
and
stealers
of
horses
and
it
seems
perfectly
natural
that
they
should
have
received
from
the
neighboring
tribes
who
had
such
frequent
evidences
of
their
skill
as
scouts
and
horse
takers
the
appellation
wolf
the
pawnees
themselves
believe
that
the
term
was
applied
to
them
because
of
their
great
endurance
as
well
as
of
their
skill
in
imitating
wolves
so
as
to
escape
detection
by
the
enemy
either
by
day
or
night
the
cheyennes
wichitas
and
comanches
all
testify
that
they
call
the
pawnees
wolves
because
they
prowl
like
wolves
because
too
they
have
the
endurance
of
wolves
and
can
travel
all
day
and
dance
all
night
and
can
make
long
journeys
living
on
the
carcasses
they
find
on
their
way
or
on
no
food
at
all
the
pawnees
when
they
went
on
the
warpath
were
always
prepared
to
simulate
wolves
this
was
one
of
their
regular
practices
and
this
no
doubt
was
one
reason
for
their
remarkable
success
in
taking
horses
for
it
enabled
them
to
escape
observation
and
to
reconnoitre
at
close
quarters
without
danger
of
discovery
wolves
on
the
prairie
were
too
common
to
excite
remark
and
at
night
they
would
approach
close
to
the
indian
camps
and
often
venture
into
them
the
pawnee
who
was
disguised
as
a
wolf
could
trot
up
close
to
the
village
of
his
enemy
see
where
the
horses
were
tied
and
perhaps
even
hear
what
was
being
said
and
lay
his
plans
accordingly
the
pawnee
starting
off
on
the
warpath
usually
carried
a
robe
made
of
wolf
skins
or
in
later
times
a
white
blanket
or
a
white
sheet
and
at
night
wrapping
himself
in
this
and
getting
down
on
his
hands
and
knees
he
walked
or
trotted
here
and
there
like
a
wolf
having
thus
transformed
himself
into
a
common
object
of
the
landscape
this
disguise
was
employed
by
day
as
well
to
escape
observation
when
traveling
in
daylight
the
pawnee
war
party
always
chose
the
ravines
and
lower
ground
to
march
in
sometimes
especially
in
a
country
where
there
was
danger
of
coming
unexpectedly
on
the
enemy
it
was
important
that
a
reconnoissance
should
be
made
from
some
commanding
point
a
man
walking
up
to
the
top
of
a
hill
might
be
seen
and
recognized
as
a
suspicious
object
a
long
way
off
but
no
one
would
look
a
second
time
at
a
wolf
while
the
party
remained
hidden
in
some
ravine
or
hollow
therefore
the
man
who
was
to
ascend
the
hill
would
put
his
white
robe
over
him
and
gallop
to
the
top
on
all
fours
and
would
sit
there
on
his
haunches
looking
all
over
the
country
and
any
one
at
a
distance
who
saw
him
would
take
him
for
a
wolf
it
was
acknowledged
on
all
hands
that
the
pawnees
could
imitate
wolves
best
in
one
of
the
stories
already
given
an
instance
is
mentioned
in
which
two
pawnees
in
the
united
states
service
made
use
of
this
device
to
recover
captured
animals
the
name
wolf
as
given
to
the
pawnees
is
probably
merely
a
translation
of
the
word
meaning
wolf
from
which
the
name
of
the
skidi
band
may
be
supposed
to
be
derived
dunbar
says
the
emblem
probably
originated
from
the
skidi
band
they
being
in
advance
of
the
other
bands
in
the
northern
migration
became
known
to
the
tribes
about
them
as
wolves
and
as
the
other
bands
arrived
the
sign
was
naturally
made
to
include
them
also
and
in
this
enlarged
use
was
at
length
accepted
by
the
pawnees
themselves

pawnee
customs
i
early
days
pawnee
history
goes
back
to
a
time
when
the
tribe
knew
nothing
of
horses
in
those
early
days
they
went
on
foot
and
depended
for
animal
food
on
their
bows
and
arrows
at
that
time
their
bows
did
not
differ
from
those
recently
in
use
but
the
heads
of
their
arrows
were
made
of
stone
and
their
knives
were
of
flint
with
this
simple
equipment
they
set
out
on
the
hunt
choosing
a
still
day
they
would
surround
a
small
bunch
of
buffalo
stretching
out
in
a
long
line
whose
extremities
would
gradually
draw
together
as
the
hunters
perhaps
disguised
as
wolves
stole
from
hill
to
hill
around
the
unconscious
prey
when
the
circle
was
complete
some
one
man
would
shout
and
startle
the
buffalo
and
then
as
they
turned
to
run
another
man
would
show
himself
before
them
and
call
out
and
turn
them
and
whichever
way
they
ran
some
one
would
appear
before
them
and
turn
them
back
the
buffalo
becoming
each
moment
more
frightened
would
run
now
this
way
now
that
and
gradually
the
pawnees
would
close
in
on
them
but
would
still
keep
the
buffalo
from
breaking
through
the
line
by
yelling
and
by
tossing
their
robes
in
the
air
as
the
prey
became
more
and
more
and
confused
they
would
run
here
and
there
and
round
and
round
within
the
ring
of
men
and
as
they
grew
more
tired
the
men
would
close
in
on
them
still
more
and
first
one
and
then
another
would
shoot
an
arrow
until
at
last
the
arrows
were
flying
fast
and
some
of
the
great
beasts
were
down
and
others
were
staggering
along
with
the
blood
pouring
from
their
mouths
and
soon
the
buffalo
were
so
worn
out
that
they
could
run
no
longer
and
it
was
an
easy
matter
for
the
indians
to
dispatch
them
even
those
which
were
only
slightly
wounded
were
secured
for
it
is
said
that
when
the
animals
were
hit
by
the
arrows
even
if
it
were
only
in
the
leg
they
would
soon
swell
up
and
die
this
statement
refers
to
a
belief
which
i
find
quite
widespread
among
plains
indians
that
the
ancient
stone
arrow
heads
were
peculiarly
deadly
and
possessed
this
property
that
even
a
slight
touch
with
them
made
a
wound
which
was
likely
to
be
fatal
the
blackfeet
indians
have
often
told
me
the
same
thing
about
the
stone
arrow
heads
which
they
used
in
early
times
game
which
inhabited
the
underbrush
or
the
forest
was
captured
by
a
method
similar
to
that
employed
to
secure
the
buffalo
if
the
pawnees
discovered
that
deer
or
elk
were
in
a
piece
of
timber
they
would
surround
it
and
then
alarm
the
game
and
keep
them
from
breaking
through
the
line
of
men
the
animals
frightened
and
confused
would
run
round
and
round
in
a
circle
until
exhausted
when
the
pawnees
would
close
in
and
kill
them
with
their
arrows
it
must
be
remembered
in
this
connection
that
in
those
days
game
animals
were
enormously
abundant
and
comparatively
tame
and
also
that
the
pawnees
from
the
necessities
of
their
lives
were
tremendously
active
very
swift
runners
and
as
tireless
as
the
wolves
from
which
they
took
their
name
their
endurance
was
something
astonishing
in
their
long
journeys
on
the
warpath
they
often
traversed
on
foot
six
or
eight
hundred
miles
of
country
carrying
during
a
part
of
the
time
very
heavy
loads
instances
are
not
uncommon
where
runners
have
traveled
one
hundred
miles
in
hours
i
myself
know
of
a
case
where
two
men
ran
over
seventy
miles
in
eleven
hours
we
may
imagine
that
in
the
old
days
when
the
pawnees
made
all
their
journeys
on
foot
and
were
thus
constantly
exercising
their
speed
and
activity
were
greater
and
their
powers
of
endurance
still
more
remarkable
although
their
ancient
arrows
were
usually
headed
with
flint
they
sometimes
used
bone
or
the
sharpened
tine
of
a
deer
horn
no
one
now
alive
can
remember
when
these
were
in
common
use
but
there
are
men
who
have
heard
their
fathers
and
their
grandfathers
tell
of
them
and
who
say
that
these
arrows
were
good
for
war
and
for
the
chase
you
could
drive
them
through
a
thick
shield
said
bear
chief
as
soon
as
they
began
to
trade
with
the
whites
arrow
heads
of
came
into
use
they
say
that
so
long
as
the
pawnees
used
flint
for
making
arrow
heads
they
used
to
find
plenty
of
these
stones
lying
on
the
prairie
but
that
when
the
whites
brought
them
iron
said
to
himself
the
pawnees
no
longer
need
these
flint
stones
i
will
make
no
more
of
them
this
shows
an
odd
confusion
of
ideas
for
of
course
the
reason
that
they
did
not
find
the
stones
was
that
they
no
longer
looked
for
them
their
use
having
been
abandoned
although
these
stone
arrow
heads
must
have
passed
out
of
general
use
toward
the
end
of
the
last
century
yet
some
of
them
were
preserved
much
later
and
it
is
possible
that
there
may
even
now
be
some
among
the
pawnees
hidden
away
in
the
sacred
bundles
after
they
ceased
to
be
used
for
general
purposes
they
took
on
a
sacred
character
and
were
employed
to
slay
the
sacrifices
among
the
skidi
to
kill
the
captive
and
in
the
lower
village
tribes
the
buffalo
and
deer
for
sacrifice
there
was
a
time
when
it
was
deemed
essential
that
the
animals
to
be
sacrificed
to
should
be
killed
by
one
of
these
ancient
and
so
sacred
arrows
in
the
early
days
the
pawnees
did
not
depend
for
food
wholly
perhaps
not
even
largely
on
the
flesh
of
the
animals
which
they
killed
by
hunting
they
have
always
been
an
agricultural
people
cultivating
the
ground
and
raising
corn
beans
pumpkins
and
squashes
they
also
dug
up
many
edible
roots
and
collected
and
dried
various
berries
and
other
fruits
besides
this
they
captured
birds
and
smaller
mammals
by
means
of
snares
and
traps
it
is
said
that
before
they
obtained
horses
they
killed
but
few
buffalo
only
enough
to
provide
themselves
with
clothing
and
with
sinew
for
sewing
backing
bows
and
other
uses
the
pawnees
aver
that
they
have
cultivated
the
corn
as
far
back
as
they
can
remember
they
say
also
that
this
is
their
corn
that
it
is
not
the
corn
of
the
whites
but
is
different
from
it
which
is
true
and
that
they
did
not
get
it
from
the
whites
it
is
their
own
on
this
they
insist
strenuously
i
have
found
it
impossible
to
obtain
any
clue
as
to
where
the
corn
came
from
or
how
they
obtained
it
to
all
inquiries
on
this
point
they
reply
that
it
must
have
been
handed
down
from
above
that
it
was
given
them
by
the
ruler
various
stories
are
told
about
it
but
none
of
them
are
very
pointed
or
satisfactory
they
call
the
corn
mother
it
has
a
sacred
character
and
plays
an
important
part
in
many
of
their
religious
ceremonies
this
name
which
they
give
it
the
mother
corn
no
doubt
refers
to
the
fact
that
it
nourishes
and
supports
them
that
by
it
they
are
made
strong
i
have
also
heard
it
said
that
it
is
called
mother
because
it
produces
others
it
has
young
ones
like
a
woman
you
put
it
in
the
ground
and
it
brings
forth
others
the
pawnees
cultivated
their
fields
with
hoes
made
from
the
shoulder
blade
of
the
buffalo
taking
the
ligament
from
the
back
of
a
neck
they
lashed
a
stick
firmly
to
the
articulation
of
the
shoulder
blade
nearly
at
right
angles
to
the
plane
of
the
bone
and
to
its
length
then
dipping
the
joint
into
hot
water
the
ligament
would
shrink
and
bind
the
bone
and
the
handle
together
as
firmly
as
iron
years
ago
on
the
sites
of
abandoned
pawnee
villages
on
the
loup
fork
and
on
the
platte
fragments
of
pottery
used
to
be
found
among
the
débris
of
the
fallen
lodges
the
manufacture
of
this
pottery
was
no
doubt
abandoned
long
ago
and
has
probably
not
been
practiced
to
any
considerable
extent
since
they
met
the
whites
a
man
about
fifty
years
of
age
stated
to
me
that
he
had
never
seen
these
pots
in
use
but
that
his
grandmother
had
told
him
that
in
her
days
they
made
and
used
them
he
said
that
they
were
accustomed
to
smooth
off
the
end
of
a
tree
for
a
mould
a
hot
fire
was
then
built
in
which
stones
were
roasted
which
were
afterward
pounded
into
fine
powder
or
sand
this
pounded
stone
they
mixed
with
fine
clay
and
when
the
material
was
of
the
proper
consistency
they
smeared
it
over
the
rounded
mould
which
was
perhaps
first
well
greased
with
buffalo
tallow
after
the
clay
had
been
made
of
even
thickness
throughout
and
smooth
on
the
outside
they
took
a
small
sharp
stone
and
made
marks
on
the
outside
to
ornament
it
when
the
material
was
sufficiently
dry
they
lifted
it
from
the
mould
and
burned
it
in
the
fire
and
while
it
was
baking
put
corn
in
the
pot
and
stirred
it
about
and
this
made
it
hard
as
iron
this
may
mean
that
it
gave
the
pot
a
glaze
on
the
inside
in
these
pots
they
boiled
food
of
all
kinds
dunbar
informs
me
that
these
pots
were
also
made
in
later
times
within
a
of
willow
twigs
the
clay
made
very
stiff
was
smeared
on
this
frame
the
inside
being
repeatedly
smoothed
with
the
moistened
hand
and
but
little
attention
being
given
to
the
appearance
of
the
outside
after
they
had
been
such
pots
were
baked
without
removing
the
frame
which
burned
away
in
the
fire
leaving
the
marks
of
the
twigs
visible
on
the
outside
of
the
pot
corn
was
and
is
still
crushed
in
wooden
mortars
hollowed
out
by
fire
and
the
pestle
is
also
of
wood
about
four
feet
long
with
an
enlargement
at
the
upper
end
to
give
added
weight
dishes
and
bowls
were
made
of
wood
or
of
large
gourds
spoons
and
ladles
were
fashioned
from
the
horns
of
the
buffalo
mats
were
woven
of
rushes
ropes
of
buffalo
hair
and
lariats
of
rawhide
fire
in
the
early
days
was
obtained
by
means
of
fire
sticks
the
point
of
one
being
twirled
on
a
hollow
in
the
other
until
the
charred
dust
at
first
smoked
and
then
ignited
it
is
said
that
sometimes
it
would
take
four
men
to
make
a
fire
one
relieving
another
as
they
grew
tired
it
was
hard
slow
work
but
sometimes
one
man
if
he
was
stout
could
make
a
fire
alone
the
use
of
fire
sticks
on
war
parties
has
continued
till
within
a
short
time
perhaps
within
twenty
years
as
their
clothing
was
manufactured
wholly
from
skins
sewing
occupied
a
considerable
part
of
the
time
of
the
women
this
was
done
by
means
of
a
bone
needle
often
the
metacarpal
or
metatarsal
bone
supporting
the
accessory
hooflets
on
the
deer
and
a
thread
twisted
of
sinews
such
sewing
was
extremely
durable
the
other
implements
and
utensils
of
the
pawnees
did
not
differ
materially
from
those
of
other
plains
indians
it
is
a
long
time
since
they
first
began
to
use
articles
and
implements
manufactured
by
the
whites
curly
chief
related
to
me
the
story
of
what
was
perhaps
the
first
official
visits
from
the
whites
ever
received
by
the
pawnees
he
said
i
heard
that
long
ago
there
was
a
time
when
there
were
no
people
in
this
country
except
indians
after
that
the
people
began
to
hear
of
men
that
had
white
skins
they
had
been
seen
far
to
the
east
before
i
was
born
they
came
out
to
our
country
and
visited
us
the
man
who
came
was
from
the
government
he
wanted
to
make
a
treaty
with
us
and
to
give
us
presents
blankets
and
guns
and
flint
and
steel
and
knives
the
head
chief
told
him
that
we
needed
none
of
these
things
he
said
have
our
buffalo
and
our
corn
these
things
the
ruler
gave
to
us
and
they
are
all
that
we
need
see
this
robe
this
keeps
me
warm
in
winter
i
need
no
blanket
the
white
men
had
with
them
some
cattle
and
the
pawnee
chief
said
out
a
heifer
here
on
the
prairie
they
led
her
out
and
the
chief
stepping
up
to
her
shot
her
through
behind
the
shoulder
with
his
arrow
and
she
fell
down
and
died
then
the
chief
said
not
my
arrow
kill
i
do
not
need
your
guns
then
he
took
his
stone
knife
and
skinned
the
heifer
and
cut
off
a
piece
of
fat
meat
when
he
had
done
this
he
said
should
i
take
your
knives
the
ruler
has
given
me
something
to
cut
with
then
taking
the
fire
sticks
he
kindled
a
fire
to
roast
the
meat
and
while
it
was
cooking
he
spoke
again
and
said
see
my
brother
that
the
ruler
has
given
us
all
that
we
need
the
buffalo
for
food
and
clothing
the
corn
to
eat
with
our
dried
meat
bows
arrows
knives
and
hoes
all
the
implements
which
we
need
for
killing
meat
or
for
cultivating
the
ground
now
go
back
to
the
country
from
whence
you
came
we
do
not
want
your
presents
and
we
do
not
want
you
to
come
into
our
country
afterward
however
a
treaty
was
made
the
first
treaties
were
not
to
purchase
land
the
government
made
presents
and
bought
the
right
to
pass
through
the
country
roads
were
made
up
the
republican
the
platte
and
the
solomon
rivers
ii
life
in
these
hasty
remarks
upon
the
ways
of
the
pawnees
which
are
in
fact
no
more
than
a
series
of
rough
notes
supplementary
to
fuller
history
of
this
people
i
shall
not
attempt
to
give
any
general
account
of
their
habits
these
can
be
learned
by
reference
to
the
papers
so
often
quoted
my
object
is
to
give
a
picture
of
the
pawnee
ways
of
thought
rather
than
of
their
material
life
their
government
was
they
were
ruled
by
a
head
chief
in
later
times
always
the
head
chief
of
the
band
and
this
title
was
hereditary
but
the
chief
if
he
had
not
the
requisite
strength
of
character
might
lose
all
his
influence
and
his
position
be
practically
though
not
in
name
held
by
a
or
even
warrior
of
his
own
or
another
band
as
has
been
well
said
the
office
itself
was
hereditary
but
authority
could
be
gained
only
by
acknowledged
personal
accomplishments
each
band
was
ruled
as
to
its
own
affairs
by
four
chiefs
a
head
chief
second
chief
third
and
fourth
chiefs
but
often
some
warrior
who
held
no
office
and
bore
no
title
might
wield
more
power
and
influence
than
any
of
these
in
minor
matters
the
chief
gave
his
orders
without
consultation
with
any
one
but
more
important
affairs
were
usually
discussed
in
council
by
chiefs
head
men
and
warriors
and
the
opinion
of
the
assemblage
prevailed
even
if
it
were
opposed
to
the
opinion
of
the
chief
among
the
pawnees
as
elsewhere
a
man
personal
character
determined
the
position
he
should
occupy
and
the
influence
he
should
wield
bravery
wisdom
and
personal
popularity
were
the
important
factors
in
acquiring
and
retaining
influence
and
authority
dunbar
alludes
to
one
matter
which
is
little
understood
in
general
that
is
the
existence
among
the
pawnees
of
a
class
of
servants
these
were
for
the
most
part
young
men
or
boys
growing
up
who
had
not
yet
acquired
any
special
standing
they
lived
in
the
family
of
men
of
position
and
influence
from
whom
they
received
support
and
for
whom
they
performed
many
offices
which
were
almost
menial
the
relation
which
they
held
to
the
head
of
the
family
was
not
altogether
unlike
that
of
a
page
or
a
squire
to
his
knight
in
mediæval
times
these
young
men
drove
in
and
saddled
the
horses
made
the
fires
ran
errands
and
carried
messages
for
the
leaders
whom
they
followed
the
same
menial
offices
were
often
performed
by
other
older
men
who
were
too
lazy
and
too
worthless
to
make
positions
for
themselves
and
who
were
willing
to
continue
to
serve
for
their
support
this
relation
of
servant
persisted
even
among
the
pawnee
scouts
after
their
enlistment
and
while
among
the
privates
in
this
body
all
were
of
course
equal
in
name
it
was
yet
common
as
the
camp
prepared
to
start
in
the
morning
to
see
the
younger
men
saddling
up
the
horses
and
performing
other
duties
for
the
chiefs
and
the
proved
warriors
whose
military
standing
was
no
higher
than
those
who
were
serving
them
the
dress
of
the
pawnee
male
consisted
of
a
breech
clout
leggings
fringed
at
the
side
and
reaching
from
ankle
to
thigh
and
moccasins
over
all
this
when
the
weather
demanded
it
was
worn
the
buffalo
robe
the
hair
side
being
turned
in
the
dress
of
the
women
consisted
of
a
sort
of
sleeveless
shirt
and
a
skirt
of
dressed
buffalo
cow
skin
reaching
to
below
the
knee
with
leggings
of
cloth
or
buckskin
laced
above
the
knee
and
moccasins
they
also
wore
the
robe
or
blanket
no
head
covering
was
used
though
in
war
and
on
great
occasions
the
men
wore
bonnets
or
chaplets
of
eagle
feathers
and
sometimes
both
men
and
women
wove
wreaths
out
of
cottonwood
or
willow
twigs
with
the
green
leaves
left
on
to
shade
their
eyes
from
the
fierce
rays
of
the
sun
the
children
were
at
first
scantily
clad
the
boy
after
he
was
released
from
his
board
went
naked
except
perhaps
for
a
string
of
beads
around
his
neck
until
he
was
ten
or
twelve
years
old
though
usually
he
assumed
the
breech
clout
before
that
age
girls
were
clad
in
a
shirt
or
smock
almost
as
soon
as
they
could
walk
at
the
present
time
but
few
of
the
pawnees
wear
their
hair
cut
in
the
ancient
fashion
but
twenty
years
ago
a
large
proportion
of
the
older
men
had
the
whole
head
shaved
except
a
narrow
roach
which
ran
from
the
forehead
to
the
back
of
the
head
this
roach
on
which
the
hair
was
usually
left
less
than
an
inch
long
was
sometimes
stiffened
at
the
sides
with
grease
and
paint
to
make
it
stand
up
well
from
this
roach
the
scalp
lock
fell
back
in
its
natural
position
at
the
present
day
many
of
the
men
cut
their
hair
short
like
the
whites
the
women
usually
wore
their
hair
in
two
braids
one
on
each
side
falling
behind
the
ears
and
the
younger
ones
were
careful
in
tending
it
all
hair
upon
the
face
and
on
other
parts
of
the
body
was
usually
plucked
out
but
i
have
seen
a
pawnee
with
a
heavy
beard
under
his
chin
paint
was
freely
used
in
ornamentation
especially
on
the
face
and
breast
black
as
is
the
case
with
most
tribes
was
the
color
for
war
red
white
and
yellow
were
used
merely
for
ornament
as
already
indicated
the
arms
of
the
pawnees
were
the
bow
and
arrow
the
lance
the
club
and
the
hatchet
the
bow
was
almost
invariably
made
of
the
and
was
backed
with
sinew
and
had
a
string
of
the
same
material
the
arrows
were
made
with
the
greatest
labor
care
and
exactness
and
those
manufactured
by
each
individual
were
so
marked
that
they
could
at
once
be
distinguished
from
those
of
every
other
maker
it
is
well
known
that
the
arrows
of
each
indian
tribe
differed
from
those
of
every
other
tribe
but
besides
this
each
arrows
bore
his
private
mark
the
manufacture
of
the
bow
and
arrows
was
a
long
slow
process
and
after
they
had
been
completed
they
were
carefully
guarded
and
protected
from
injury
although
the
pawnees
have
long
been
accustomed
to
use
firearms
in
war
yet
the
use
of
the
bow
and
arrow
in
hunting
persisted
up
to
quite
recent
times
in
fact
up
to
the
date
of
the
disappearance
of
the
buffalo
a
reason
for
this
is
readily
found
in
the
fact
that
an
arrow
cost
only
time
to
manufacture
and
the
indian
has
an
abundance
of
time
for
cartridges
or
for
powder
and
lead
he
must
pay
money
or
trade
some
of
his
possessions
an
arrow
too
may
be
used
over
and
over
again
and
may
thus
account
for
many
head
of
game
whereas
a
cartridge
can
be
used
but
once
in
their
secret
war
expeditions
too
the
bow
was
a
favorite
weapon
because
it
was
noiseless
an
enemy
found
at
a
little
distance
from
his
camp
could
be
stealthily
approached
and
silently
shot
down
without
necessarily
alarming
persons
in
the
neighborhood
when
a
rifle
shot
ringing
over
the
prairie
and
echoing
among
the
bluffs
would
call
out
every
warrior
in
the
village
to
learn
whence
it
came
i
have
been
told
by
warriors
that
on
their
war
parties
they
left
their
rifles
at
home
and
carried
only
their
bows
so
that
they
might
not
be
tempted
by
the
sight
of
an
enemy
to
fire
a
shot
which
might
bring
themselves
and
their
companions
into
danger
the
pawnees
were
superb
horsemen
and
owned
many
ponies
i
can
learn
nothing
definite
as
to
when
they
first
obtained
these
animals
nor
from
what
source
a
tradition
exists
that
up
to
the
time
of
the
tribe
advent
into
the
northern
country
their
only
beast
of
burden
was
the
dog
which
then
carried
their
packs
and
hauled
their
the
story
goes
that
the
pawnees
obtained
their
first
horses
soon
after
their
separation
from
the
wichitas
the
three
bands
were
traveling
north
together
when
the
scouts
who
had
been
sent
ahead
to
overlook
the
country
hastened
back
and
announced
to
the
chiefs
that
they
had
discovered
a
camp
of
indians
a
council
was
at
once
held
to
determine
whether
they
should
attack
this
unknown
village
as
enemies
or
should
approach
them
as
friends
the
majority
declared
for
an
attack
and
it
was
so
decided
approaching
under
cover
as
near
as
possible
the
horde
of
dusky
footmen
poured
over
the
hills
and
down
into
the
valley
where
stood
the
doomed
village
the
attack
was
sudden
fierce
and
successful
they
killed
and
captured
many
of
the
enemy
and
took
the
camp
while
the
survivors
fled
in
hopeless
confusion
among
the
plunder
taken
were
a
lot
of
horses
strange
beasts
then
to
the
rude
pawnees
and
at
which
they
wondered
greatly
a
captive
woman
explained
to
the
conquerors
that
these
creatures
were
good
to
ride
and
useful
to
pack
on
old
men
still
tell
with
a
smile
of
the
ludicrous
first
attempts
of
the
warriors
to
ride
the
horses
this
occurrence
is
said
to
have
taken
place
on
the
smoky
hill
river
in
what
is
now
kansas
and
the
indians
from
whom
the
horses
were
captured
are
understood
to
have
been

the
permanent
habitations
of
the
pawnees
were
dirt
or
sod
houses
often
of
very
considerable
size
the
remains
of
the
old
medicine
lodge
of
the
skidi
on
the
loup
show
it
to
have
been
two
hundred
and
ten
feet
in
diameter
the
lodges
were
circular
in
form
with
walls
seven
or
eight
feet
high
and
the
roof
rose
from
these
walls
to
the
apex
above
the
center
of
the
lodge
where
was
the
hole
for
the
escape
of
smoke
from
the
fire
which
burned
on
the
floor
below
a
covered
passageway
led
to
the
entrance
around
the
walls
the
inmates
slept
the
beds
being
partitioned
off
and
protected
in
front
as
well
by
a
curtain
which
might
be
a
skin
or
a
mat
woven
of
reeds
or
coarse
grass
the
cooking
was
all
done
over
the
fire
in
the
middle
of
the
lodge
possessions
were
stowed
away
behind
the
beds
or
hung
up
on
the
posts
which
supported
the
roof
on
their
hunts
or
when
traveling
the
pawnees
used
the
ordinary
cow
skin
lodge
of
the
plains
indians
this
was
composed
of
neatly
dressed
buffalo
hides
from
which
the
hair
had
been
removed
set
up
over
a
made
up
usually
of
sixteen
long
slender
poles
an
opening
at
the
top
gave
exit
to
the
smoke
and
wings
projecting
at
either
side
of
the
smoke
hole
and
so
arranged
that
their
positions
could
be
changed
by
moving
two
additional
poles
on
the
outside
of
the
lodge
served
to
regulate
the
draft
and
keep
the
lodge
free
from
smoke
the
inmates
slept
close
to
the
walls
and
the
fire
with
the
inevitable
pot
hanging
over
it
burned
in
the
middle
these
lodges
were
warm
and
usually
dry
and
made
good
shelters
they
were
occupied
for
the
greater
part
of
the
year
for
the
pawnees
after
the
spring
planting
was
fairly
over
usually
started
at
once
on
their
summer
hunt
from
which
they
only
returned
in
time
to
harvest
their
crops
at
the
beginning
of
winter
when
the
robes
were
at
their
best
they
made
the
winter
hunt
from
which
they
did
not
return
until
toward
spring
the
planting
over
they
set
out
again
on
the
hunt
in
their
personal
intercourse
with
each
other
and
with
strangers
the
pawnees
were
kindly
and
accommodating
i
have
had
little
kindnesses
unostentatiously
done
me
by
pawnee
men
such
as
i
should
never
expect
to
receive
from
white
persons
not
connected
with
me
by
ties
of
blood
in
the
village
the
gave
freely
to
those
who
were
poor
and
all
were
very
hospitable
they
were
a
merry
race
keenly
alive
to
the
ridiculous
and
very
fond
of
a
joke
they
were
great
chatterers
and
had
about
them
nothing
of
the
supposed
taciturnity
of
the
indian
of
modesty
or
delicacy
in
conversation
as
we
know
it
they
had
none
both
sexes
spoke
freely
to
each
other
of
matters
which
are
never
mentioned
in
civilized
society
and
much
of
their
conversation
as
well
as
many
of
their
stories
could
not
well
be
printed
iii
a
summer
hunt
it
was
in
the
month
of
july
the
pawnees
were
preparing
to
start
on
their
buffalo
hunt
and
only
the
last
religious
rites
remained
to
be
performed
before
the
nation
should
leave
the
village
for
the
buffalo
range
idadi
came
from
without
the
lodge
and
as
i
replied
the
sturdy
figure
of
appeared
in
the
doorway
idad
come
brother
they
are
going
to
dance
he
said
and
then
he
turned
and
went
out
i
rose
from
the
pile
of
robes
on
which
i
had
been
dozing
and
after
rolling
them
up
strolled
out
after
him
the
village
seemed
deserted
but
off
toward
the
medicine
lodge
which
stood
upon
its
outskirts
i
could
see
a
throng
of
indians
and
a
low
murmur
of
voices
and
of
footsteps
the
hum
which
always
accompanies
any
large
assemblage
was
borne
to
my
ears
on
the
evening
breeze
the
ceremonies
which
comprised
the
consecration
of
the
buffalo
staves
and
the
buffalo
dance
were
about
to
begin
the
great
dirt
lodge
was
crowded
i
pushed
my
way
through
the
throng
of
women
and
boys
who
made
up
the
outer
circle
of
spectators
and
soon
found
myself
among
the
men
who
made
way
for
me
until
i
reached
a
position
from
which
i
could
see
all
that
was
going
on
within
the
circle
about
which
they
stood
for
several
days
the
priests
and
the
doctors
had
been
preparing
for
this
solemn
religious
ceremonial
they
had
fasted
long
earnest
prayers
had
been
made
to
and
sacrifices
had
been
offered
now
the
twelve
buffalo
skulls
had
been
arranged
on
the
ground
in
a
and
near
them
stood
the
chiefs
and
doctors
reverently
holding
in
their
hands
the
buffalo
staves
and
sacred
bows
and
arrows
and
other
implements
of
the
chase
for
a
little
while
they
stood
silent
with
bowed
heads
but
presently
one
and
then
another
began
to
murmur
their
petitions
to
the
spirit
father
at
first
their
voices
were
low
and
mumbling
but
gradually
they
became
more
earnest
and
lifted
their
eyes
toward
heaven
it
was
impossible
to
distinguish
what
each
one
said
but
now
and
then
disjointed
sentences
reached
me
father
you
are
the
ruler
we
are
poor
take
pity
on
us
send
us
plenty
of
buffalo
plenty
of
fat
cows
father
we
are
your
children
help
the
people
send
us
plenty
of
meat
so
that
we
may
be
strong
and
our
bodies
may
increase
and
our
flesh
grow
hard
father
you
see
us
listen
as
they
prayed
they
moved
their
hands
backward
and
forward
over
the
implements
which
they
held
and
at
length
reverently
deposited
them
on
the
ground
within
the
line
of
buffalo
skulls
and
then
stepped
back
still
continuing
their
prayers
it
was
a
touching
sight
to
witness
these
men
calling
upon
their
god
for
help
all
of
them
had
passed
middle
life
and
some
were
blind
and
tottering
but
they
prayed
with
a
fervor
and
earnestness
that
compelled
respect
they
threw
their
souls
into
their
prayers
and
as
a
son
might
entreat
his
earthly
father
for
some
great
gift
so
they
plead
with
their
bodies
quivered
with
emotion
and
great
drops
of
sweat
stood
upon
their
brows
they
were
thoroughly
sincere
after
the
last
of
the
articles
had
been
placed
upon
the
ground
their
voices
grew
lower
and
at
length
died
away
a
moment
later
a
drum
sounded
and
a
dozen
or
twenty
young
warriors
sprang
into
the
circle
and
began
the
buffalo
dance
this
was
kept
up
without
intermission
for
three
days
and
as
soon
as
it
was
over
the
tribe
moved
out
of
the
village
on
the
hunt
from
the
village
on
the
loup
we
traveled
southward
for
in
those
days
the
region
between
the
platte
and
the
smoky
rivers
swarmed
with
buffalo
with
the
pawnees
were
a
few
poncas
omahas
and
otoes
so
that
there
were
about
four
thousand
indians
in
the
camp
it
was
the
summer
hunt
of
the
tribe
twice
each
year
the
agent
permitted
them
to
visit
the
buffalo
range
the
meat
which
they
killed
and
dried
on
these
hunts
the
corn
and
squashes
which
they
grew
on
their
farms
and
the
small
annuities
received
from
the
government
were
all
they
had
to
subsist
on
from
season
to
season
thus
the
occasion
was
one
of
importance
to
the
indians
perhaps
only
the
older
heads
among
them
fully
appreciated
its
economic
interest
but
for
all
it
was
a
holiday
time
a
temporary
escape
from
confinement
life
on
the
reservation
was
monotonous
there
was
nothing
to
do
except
to
sit
in
the
sun
and
smoke
and
tell
stories
of
the
former
glories
of
the
nation
of
successful
fights
with
the
sioux
and
cheyennes
and
of
horse
stealing
expeditions
from
which
the
heroes
had
returned
with
great
herds
of
ponies
and
much
glory
now
for
a
little
while
they
returned
to
the
old
free
life
of
earlier
years
when
the
land
had
been
all
their
own
and
they
had
wandered
at
will
over
the
broad
expanse
of
the
rolling
prairie
now
for
a
time
it
was
as
it
had
been
before
the
cornfields
of
the
white
man
had
begun
to
dot
their
river
bottoms
before
the
sound
of
his
rifle
had
made
wild
their
game
before
the
whistle
had
shrieked
through
the
still
hot
summer
air
half
a
provision
was
now
to
be
secured
the
comfort
almost
the
existence
of
the
tribe
for
the
next
six
months
depended
on
the
accumulation
of
an
abundant
supply
of
dried
buffalo
meat
and
no
precaution
was
omitted
to
make
the
hunt
successful
it
would
not
do
to
permit
each
individual
to
hunt
independently
indiscriminate
buffalo
running
by
six
or
eight
hundred
men
scattered
over
the
prairie
each
one
working
for
himself
alone
would
result
in
the
killing
of
some
few
buffalo
but
would
terrify
and
drive
away
all
the
others
in
the
neighborhood
this
matter
was
too
important
to
be
trusted
to
chance
the
hunting
was
systematized
the
government
of
the
hunt
was
intrusted
to
the
pawnee
soldiers
these
were
warriors
of
mature
age
not
so
old
as
to
be
unfitted
for
active
work
yet
with
the
fires
of
early
youth
somewhat
tempered
by
years
of
experience
men
whose
judgment
and
discretion
could
at
all
times
be
relied
on
these
soldiers
acted
under
the
chiefs
but
the
practical
guidance
of
the
hunt
was
wholly
in
their
hands
they
determined
the
direction
and
length
of
each
day
march
and
the
spot
for
camping
they
selected
the
young
men
who
should
act
as
scouts
and
arranged
all
the
details
of
the
approach
and
the
charge
when
a
herd
of
buffalo
was
discovered
large
enough
to
call
for
a
general
surround
all
the
men
were
under
their
control
and
amenable
to
their
discipline
they
did
not
hesitate
to
exercise
their
authority
nor
to
severely
punish
any
one
who
committed
an
act
by
which
the
success
of
the
hunt
might
be
imperilled
the
scouts
sent
out
by
the
soldiers
were
chosen
from
among
the
younger
men
they
acted
merely
as
spies
their
office
was
to
find
the
buffalo
they
moved
rapidly
along
far
in
advance
of
the
marching
column
and
from
the
tops
of
the
highest
hills
carefully
scanned
the
country
before
them
in
search
of
buffalo
if
a
herd
was
discerned
they
were
not
to
show
themselves
nor
in
any
way
to
alarm
it
having
found
the
game
their
duty
was
to
observe
its
movement
learn
where
it
was
likely
to
be
for
the
next
few
hours
and
then
to
report
as
quickly
as
possible
to
the
camp
the
soldiers
then
determined
what
action
should
be
taken
if
the
news
was
received
late
in
the
day
and
the
buffalo
were
at
some
distance
the
camp
would
probably
be
moved
as
near
as
practicable
to
where
the
herd
was
feeding
and
the
chase
would
take
place
in
the
early
morning
if
on
the
other
hand
the
scouts
found
the
herd
in
the
morning
the
men
would
start
off
at
once
for
the
surround
leaving
the
women
to
follow
and
make
camp
as
near
as
possible
to
where
the
dead
buffalo
lay
day
after
day
we
traveled
southward
crossing
the
platte
river
and
then
the
republican
about
due
south
of
the
present
flourishing
town
of
kearney
south
of
the
platte
a
few
scattering
buffalo
were
found
but
no
large
herds
had
been
met
with
nothing
that
called
for
a
surround
at
length
we
camped
one
night
on
the
beaver
a
small
affluent
of
the
republican
emptying
into
it
from
the
south
with
the
gray
dawn
of
morning
the
camp
as
usual
is
astir
by
the
time
our
little
party
have
turned
out
of
our
blankets
some
of
the
indians
have
already
finished
eating
and
are
catching
up
their
horses
and
preparing
to
ride
off
over
the
bluffs
leaving
the
squaws
to
take
down
the
lodges
pack
the
ponies
and
pursue
the
designated
line
of
march
before
we
are
ready
to
pull
out
most
of
the
ponies
have
been
packed
and
a
long
irregular
line
of
indians
is
creeping
across
the
level
valley
and
beginning
to
wind
up
the
face
of
the
bluffs
the
procession
moves
slowly
proceeding
at
a
walk
most
of
those
who
remain
with
the
column
are
on
foot
the
squaws
leading
the
ponies
and
many
of
the
men
wrapped
in
their
blankets
and
with
only
their
bows
and
arrows
on
their
backs
walking
briskly
over
the
prairie
a
little
to
one
side
these
last
are
the
poorer
indians
those
who
have
but
few
horses
they
travel
on
foot
letting
their
horses
run
without
burdens
so
that
they
may
be
fresh
and
strong
whenever
they
shall
be
needed
for
running
the
buffalo
side
by
side
at
the
head
of
the
column
walk
eight
men
who
carry
the
buffalo
staves
these
are
slender
spruce
poles
like
a
short
wrapped
with
blue
and
red
cloth
and
elaborately
ornamented
with
bead
work
and
with
the
feathers
of
hawks
and
of
the
war
eagle
these
sticks
are
carried
by
men
selected
by
the
chiefs
and
doctors
in
private
council
and
are
religiously
guarded
upon
the
care
of
these
emblems
and
the
respect
paid
to
them
depends
in
a
great
measure
the
success
of
the
hunt
while
borne
before
the
moving
column
no
one
is
permitted
to
cross
the
line
of
march
in
front
of
them
close
behind
the
staff
bearers
follow
a
number
of
the
principal
men
of
the
tribe
the
head
chief
old
and
a
dozen
or
fifteen
or
head
men
all
mounted
on
superb
horses
behind
them
comes
the
camp
at
large
a
fantastically
mingled
multitude
marching
without
any
appearance
of
order
here
most
of
the
individuals
are
women
young
girls
and
children
for
the
men
who
accompany
the
camp
usually
march
singly
or
by
twos
and
threes
a
little
apart
from
the
mob
most
of
those
rich
enough
in
horses
to
be
able
to
ride
at
all
times
are
scattered
over
the
prairie
for
miles
in
every
direction
picking
up
the
small
bands
of
buffalo
which
have
been
passed
by
the
scouts
as
not
large
enough
to
call
for
a
general
surround
the
hunters
are
careful
however
not
to
follow
too
close
upon
the
advance
line
whose
movements
they
can
readily
observe
upon
the
bare
bluffs
far
ahead
of
them
at
the
time
of
which
i
am
writing
the
pawnees
had
no
wagons
all
their
possessions
being
transported
on
pack
horses
the
indian
pack
pony
is
apt
to
be
old
and
sedate
requiring
no
special
guidance
nor
control
a
strip
of
rawhide
knotted
about
the
lower
jaw
serves
as
a
bridle
and
is
either
tied
up
to
the
saddle
or
held
in
the
hand
in
packing
the
animals
a
bundle
of
is
tied
on
either
side
of
the
saddle
one
end
projecting
forward
toward
the
head
the
other
dragging
on
the
ground
behind
this
is
the
cross
poles
are
often
tied
between
these
two
dragging
bundles
and
on
these
are
carried
packages
of
meat
and
robes
often
too
on
a
robe
stretched
between
them
a
sick
or
wounded
indian
unable
to
ride
is
transported
the
having
been
fastened
to
the
saddle
the
lodge
is
folded
up
and
placed
on
it
between
them
and
blankets
robes
and
other
articles
are
piled
on
top
of
this
until
the
horse
has
on
its
back
what
appears
to
be
about
as
much
as
it
can
carry
the
pack
is
then
lashed
firmly
in
position
and
pots
buckets
and
other
utensils
are
tied
about
it
wherever
there
is
room
on
top
of
the
load
so
arranged
one
or
two
women
or
three
or
four
children
clamber
and
settle
themselves
comfortably
there
and
the
old
horse
is
turned
loose
each
rider
carries
in
her
hand
a
whip
with
which
she
strikes
the
horse
at
every
step
not
cruelly
at
all
but
just
from
force
of
habit
if
the
pack
is
low
so
that
her
feet
reach
down
to
the
animal
sides
she
keeps
up
also
a
constant
drumming
on
his
ribs
with
her
heels
the
old
horse
pays
not
the
slightest
attention
to
any
of
these
demonstrations
of
impatience
but
plods
steadily
along
at
a
quiet
walk
his
eyes
half
closed
and
his
ears
nodding
at
each
step
if
the
riders
are
women
each
one
holds
a
child
or
two
in
her
arms
or
on
her
back
or
perhaps
the
baby
board
is
hung
over
the
end
of
a
and
swings
free
if
the
living
load
consists
of
children
they
have
in
their
arms
a
lot
of
puppies
for
puppies
occupy
with
relation
to
the
small
indian
girls
the
place
which
dolls
hold
among
the
white
children
many
of
the
pack
animals
are
mares
with
young
colts
and
these
last
instead
of
following
quietly
at
their
mothers
heels
range
here
and
there
sometimes
before
and
sometimes
behind
their
dams
they
are
thus
constantly
getting
lost
in
the
crowd
and
then
they
charge
backward
and
forward
in
wild
affright
neighing
shrilly
until
they
have
again
found
their
proper
place
in
the
line
of
march
many
of
the
yearling
colts
have
very
small
and
light
packs
tied
on
their
backs
while
the
are
often
ridden
by
the
tiniest
of
indian
boys
who
are
now
giving
them
their
first
lesson
in
loose
horses
of
all
ages
roam
about
at
will
and
their
continual
cries
mingle
with
the
barking
of
dogs
the
calls
of
women
and
the
yells
of
boys
and
make
an
unceasing
noise
the
boys
are
boiling
over
with
animal
spirits
and
like
their
civilized
brothers
of
the
same
age
are
continually
running
about
chasing
each
other
wrestling
shooting
arrows
and
playing
games
of
which
the
familiar
stick
game
seems
the
favorite
whenever
the
column
draws
near
any
cover
which
may
shelter
game
such
as
a
few
bushes
in
a
ravine
or
the
fringe
of
low
willows
along
some
little
watercourse
the
younger
men
and
boys
scatter
out
and
surround
it
they
beat
it
in
the
most
thorough
manner
and
any
game
which
it
contains
is
driven
out
on
the
prairie
surrounded
and
killed
the
appearance
even
of
a
jackass
rabbit
throws
the
boys
into
a
fever
of
excitement
and
causes
them
to
shriek
and
yell
as
if
in
a
frenzy
all
the
morning
i
rode
with
the
indians
either
at
the
head
of
the
column
chatting
as
best
i
could
with
and
other
chiefs
or
falling
back
and
riding
among
the
women
and
children
whom
i
never
tired
of
watching
frequently
during
the
day
i
saw
at
a
distance
on
the
prairie
small
bunches
of
buffalo
in
full
flight
hotly
pursued
by
riders
and
occasionally
two
or
three
men
would
ride
up
to
the
marching
columns
with
heavy
loads
of
meat
the
wet
flanks
of
the
ponies
told
a
story
of
sharp
rapid
chases
and
their
tossing
heads
and
eager
excited
looks
showed
how
much
interest
they
took
in
the
hunt
the
report
of
firearms
was
seldom
heard
most
of
the
indians
hunted
with
the
primitive
weapon
of
their
forefathers
the
bow
and
arrow
for
buffalo
running
an
arrow
is
nearly
as
effective
as
lead
the
power
of
the
bow
in
expert
hands
is
tremendous
riding
within
half
a
dozen
yards
of
the
victim
side
the
practiced
bowman
will
drive
the
dart
so
far
through
the
body
of
the
buffalo
that
its
shaft
may
project
a
foot
or
more
from
the
opposite
side
sometimes
indeed
may
pass
quite
through
besides
the
bow
can
be
used
very
rapidly
and
accurately
i
have
seen
an
indian
take
a
sheaf
of
six
arrows
in
his
hand
and
discharge
them
at
a
mark
more
rapidly
and
with
more
certainty
of
hitting
his
target
than
i
could
fire
the
six
barrels
of
a
revolver
it
was
nearly
noon
and
i
was
riding
along
at
the
head
of
the
column
i
had
but
one
horse
and
did
not
care
to
wear
him
out
by
chasing
around
over
the
prairie
preferring
to
save
him
for
some
great
effort
we
were
traveling
along
a
smooth
divide
between
two
sets
of
ravines
which
ran
off
one
to
the
east
and
the
other
to
the
west
had
just
informed
me
by
signs
that
we
should
make
camp
about
two
miles
further
on
by
a
stream
whose
course
we
could
trace
from
where
we
then
were
suddenly
without
the
slightest
warning
the
huge
dark
bodies
of
half
a
dozen
buffalo
sprang
into
view
rising
out
of
a
ravine
on
our
left
not
a
hundred
yards
distant
when
they
saw
the
multitude
before
them
they
stopped
and
stared
at
us
they
were
too
close
for
me
to
resist
the
temptation
to
pursue
as
i
lifted
the
reins
from
my
pony
neck
and
bent
forward
the
little
animal
sprang
into
a
sharp
gallop
toward
the
game
and
as
he
did
so
i
saw
half
a
dozen
indians
shoot
out
from
the
column
and
follow
me
the
buffalo
wheeled
and
in
an
instant
were
out
of
sight
but
when
i
reached
the
edge
of
the
bank
down
which
they
had
plunged
i
could
see
through
the
cloud
of
dust
which
they
left
behind
them
their
uncouth
forms
dashing
down
the
ravine
my
nimble
pony
as
eager
for
the
race
as
his
rider
hurled
himself
down
the
steep
pitch
and
sped
along
the
narrow
broken
bed
of
the
gully
i
could
feel
that
sometimes
he
would
lengthen
his
stride
to
leap
wide
ditches
where
the
water
from
some
side
ravine
had
cut
away
the
ground
but
i
never
knew
of
these
until
they
were
passed
my
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
fleeing
herd
my
ears
were
intent
on
the
pursuing
horsemen
close
behind
me
i
could
hear
the
quick
pounding
of
many
hoofs
and
could
feel
that
one
of
the
horses
nearer
than
the
rest
was
steadily
drawing
up
to
me
but
i
was
gaining
on
the
buffalo
already
the
confused
rumble
of
their
almost
drowned
those
of
the
horses
behind
me
and
the
air
was
full
of
the
dust
and
small
pebbles
thrown
up
by
their
hurrying
feet
but
they
were
still
ahead
of
me
and
the
gulch
was
so
narrow
that
i
could
not
shoot
the
leading
horseman
drew
nearer
and
nearer
and
was
now
almost
at
my
side
i
could
see
the
lean
head
and
long
slim
neck
of
his
pony
under
my
right
arm
and
could
hear
the
rider
speak
to
his
horse
and
urge
him
forward
in
the
race
my
horse
did
his
best
but
the
other
had
the
most
speed
he
shot
by
me
and
a
moment
later
was
alongside
the
last
buffalo
as
he
passed
me
the
young
indian
made
a
laughing
gesture
of
triumph
slipped
an
arrow
on
his
bowstring
and
drew
it
to
its
head
but
just
as
he
was
about
to
let
it
fly
his
horse
which
was
but
a
colt
took
fright
at
the
huge
animal
which
it
had
overtaken
and
shied
violently
to
the
right
almost
unseating
its
rider
at
the
same
moment
the
buffalo
swerved
a
little
to
the
left
and
thus
lost
a
few
feet
truly
the
race
is
not
always
to
the
swift
as
i
passed
the
indian
i
could
not
restrain
a
little
whoop
of
satisfaction
and
then
swinging
my
rifle
around
i
fired
the
buffalo
fell
in
its
stride
tossing
up
a
mighty
cloud
of
the
soft
yellow
earth
and
my
pony
ran
by
him
fifty
yards
before
he
could
be
checked
then
i
turned
and
rode
back
to
look
at
the
game
the
other
indians
had
passed
me
like
a
whirlwind
and
close
at
the
heels
of
the
herd
had
swept
around
a
point
of
bluff
and
out
of
sight
only
my
rival
remained
and
he
was
excitedly
arguing
with
his
horse
the
logic
of
a
applied
with
vigor
about
the
creature
ears
convinced
it
that
it
must
approach
the
dead
buffalo
and
then
the
rider
dismounting
and
passing
his
lariat
about
the
animal
horns
drew
the
pony
head
to
within
a
few
feet
of
the
terrifying
mass
and
fastened
the
rope
when
he
had
accomplished
this
he
grinned
pleasantly
at
me
and
i
responded
in
kind
and
in
dumb
show
transferred
to
him
all
my
right
and
title
in
the
dead
buffalo
at
this
he
smiled
still
more
cheerfully
and
set
to
work
butchering
the
animal
was
a
superb
specimen
just
entering
his
prime
and
was
fat
round
and
sleek
his
horns
were
symmetrically
curved
and
beautifully
polished
not
a
scratch
marred
their
shining
surfaces
nor
a
splinter
was
frayed
from
their
sharp
points
the
sweeping
black
beard
was
long
and
full
and
the
thick
curls
upon
his
hump
and
massive
shoulders
were
soft
and
deep
while
the
short
hair
of
his
sides
and
hips
was
smooth
as
the
coat
of
a
horse
his
size
was
enormous
it
seemed
that
he
would
have
turned
the
scale
at
quite
two
thousand
pounds
certainly
his
weight
exceeded
that
of
both
the
ponies
that
stood
beside
him
a
few
moments
later
i
was
again
in
the
saddle
and
riding
on
along
the
course
taken
by
the
remaining
buffalo
for
i
was
anxious
to
see
what
had
become
of
them
on
rounding
the
point
of
the
bluff
where
i
had
last
seen
them
my
curiosity
was
satisfied
the
valley
here
widened
out
until
it
was
perhaps
sixty
yards
across
and
on
either
side
rose
vertical
bluffs
of
yellow
chalk
to
a
height
of
forty
feet
scattered
about
over
the
little
plain
lay
half
a
dozen
buffalo
over
each
of
which
bent
one
or
two
indians
busily
plying
the
knife
at
the
foot
of
the
bluff
at
one
side
of
the
valley
stood
four
or
five
others
looking
at
a
cow
perched
on
a
narrow
shelf
ten
feet
below
the
top
i
shall
never
understand
how
that
animal
reached
the
position
it
occupied
there
was
evidently
no
way
of
getting
to
it
except
by
jumping
up
from
below
which
was
obviously
impossible
or
down
from
above
which
seemed
out
of
the
question
the
shelf
was
so
short
that
the
animal
could
move
neither
backward
nor
forward
and
was
just
wide
enough
for
it
to
stand
on
as
i
rode
up
and
joined
the
little
group
below
it
the
head
and
shoulders
of
a
indian
appeared
over
the
top
of
the
bluff
above
the
cow
he
lay
down
flat
on
his
breast
and
holding
in
both
hands
an
pistol
attempted
to
shoot
the
cow
from
above
but
his
old
arm
would
not
go
off
he
snapped
it
half
a
dozen
times
and
then
discouraged
called
out
something
to
us
below
one
of
the
boys
turned
to
me
and
said
very
slowly
and
distinctly
he
say
you
shoot
i
therefore
dismounted
and
fired
at
the
cow
which
responded
by
shaking
her
head
angrily
and
whisking
her
short
tail
another
call
came
from
the
old
fellow
on
top
of
the
bluff
and
the
young
man
said
to
me
he
say
you
hit
her
right
spot
a
moment
later
the
cow
bent
forward
and
fell
on
her
knees
and
the
indian
above
dropped
down
on
her
back
turning
my
horse
head
in
the
direction
from
which
i
had
come
i
rode
up
through
a
side
ravine
on
to
the
high
prairie
a
mile
away
i
could
see
the
column
of
marching
indians
plodding
along
at
their
old
slow
pace
here
and
there
over
the
rolling
hills
dark
forms
were
visible
some
of
them
in
rapid
motion
others
apparently
stationary
often
it
was
impossible
to
determine
whether
these
figures
were
horsemen
or
buffalo
but
sometimes
far
away
i
could
see
a
mimic
chase
in
which
pursuer
and
pursued
appeared
no
larger
than
ants
as
i
came
up
with
the
indians
they
were
just
descending
into
the
stream
bottom
where
camp
was
to
be
made
the
small
boys
had
as
usual
dispersed
themselves
over
the
valley
and
among
the
underbrush
many
of
the
squaws
leaving
the
ponies
and
packs
to
their
or
children
were
hurrying
up
or
down
the
stream
to
gather
wood
already
the
leading
ponies
were
being
relieved
of
their
loads
suddenly
from
the
mouth
of
a
little
ravine
coming
down
into
the
stream
bottom
rose
a
chorus
of
shrill
yelps
and
shrieks
from
childish
throats
and
a
gang
of
wild
turkeys
were
seen
running
rapidly
through
the
high
grass
toward
the
hills
a
moment
later
with
a
loud
of
alarm
they
took
wing
but
not
before
several
of
their
number
had
fallen
before
the
missiles
of
the
boys
most
of
them
went
up
or
down
the
creek
but
one
inexperienced
bird
took
its
course
directly
over
our
heads
those
who
have
seen
the
indian
only
on
dress
parade
talk
of
his
stolidity
impassiveness
and
his
marvelous
control
over
his
countenance
and
his
emotions
this
demeanor
he
can
and
does
assume
and
when
he
is
with
white
men
or
among
strangers
he
is
usually
all
that
he
has
been
pictured
but
take
him
by
himself
and
he
expresses
his
feelings
with
as
little
restraint
as
a
child
so
it
was
now
no
grave
chief
nor
warrior
nor
mighty
worker
of
magic
was
too
dignified
to
express
his
interest
at
the
appearance
of
this
great
bird
sailing
laboriously
along
thirty
or
forty
feet
above
him
it
was
as
if
the
turkey
had
flown
over
a
great
company
of
schoolboys
and
the
utter
abandonment
of
the
excited
multitude
the
entire
absence
of
restraint
the
perfect
naturalness
of
the
expression
of
feeling
had
in
them
something
very
delightful
and
infectious
every
indian
who
held
in
his
hand
anything
that
was
light
enough
to
throw
hurled
it
at
the
bird
and
a
cloud
of
whips
sticks
hatchets
fleshers
and
arrows
rose
to
meet
it
as
it
passed
along
one
missile
knocked
from
its
tail
a
few
long
feathers
which
drifted
slowly
down
on
the
heads
of
the
people
it
kept
on
but
before
it
had
passed
beyond
the
long
line
of
indians
extending
back
over
the
plain
its
strength
became
exhausted
it
came
to
the
ground
and
was
at
once
dispatched
by
those
nearest
to
it
almost
before
the
turkey
fate
had
been
decided
many
of
the
lodges
had
been
pitched
and
now
the
slender
gray
columns
from
a
hundred
began
to
climb
up
through
the
still
air
toward
the
blue
above
the
women
were
hard
at
work
cooking
or
spreading
out
freshly
killed
robes
or
putting
up
drying
scaffolds
while
the
men
lounged
in
the
shade
and
smoked
or
chatted
our
wagon
was
halted
at
one
side
of
the
camp
and
the
tired
horses
and
mules
stripped
of
saddles
and
harness
and
picketed
near
at
hand
the
indian
pack
ponies
were
collected
and
driven
off
on
the
upland
in
charge
of
several
boys
we
had
invitations
to
eat
meat
at
several
lodges
that
day
usually
we
did
not
accept
these
freely
proffered
hospitalities
because
we
had
no
means
of
returning
them
but
one
of
these
invitations
came
from
a
particular
friend
and
we
broke
through
our
rule
we
feasted
on
roast
ribs
and
dried
meat
and
really
had
a
delightful
time
it
was
about
three
when
we
finished
the
meal
and
we
were
lounging
about
the
lodge
smoking
and
chatting
in
lazy
fashion
when
we
were
startled
by
a
series
of
yells
and
shouts
among
which
i
distinguished
the
words
the
sioux
are
coming
our
indian
companions
snatched
up
their
arms
and
rushed
out
of
the
lodge
and
we
were
not
slow
in
following
get
on
your
horses
quick
shouted
our
host
the
camp
was
in
a
state
of
wild
excitement
naked
men
were
running
to
their
horses
and
jerking
their
lariats
from
the
picket
pins
sprang
on
their
backs
and
rode
hard
for
the
hills
while
women
and
boys
rushed
about
catching
horses
and
bringing
them
in
among
the
lodges
where
they
were
securely
fastened
less
than
a
mile
away
we
saw
the
horse
herd
dashing
along
at
top
speed
and
a
little
to
one
side
of
it
a
horseman
riding
in
circles
and
waving
his
blanket
before
him
it
was
evident
that
the
sioux
were
trying
to
run
off
the
herd
we
ran
as
hard
as
we
could
to
the
wagon
caught
up
rifles
and
cartridge
belts
and
buckling
on
the
latter
as
we
ran
kept
on
to
the
horses
there
was
no
time
to
saddle
up
we
looped
the
ropes
around
their
jaws
sprang
on
their
naked
backs
and
were
off
as
we
rode
up
on
the
prairie
the
herd
of
ponies
thundered
by
and
swept
down
the
bluffs
to
the
camp
the
rolling
expanse
before
us
was
dotted
with
indians
each
one
urging
forward
his
horse
to
its
utmost
speed
many
of
them
were
already
a
long
way
in
advance
and
were
passing
over
the
furthest
high
bluff
which
seemed
to
rise
up
and
meet
the
sky
hard
as
we
might
push
our
ponies
there
was
little
hope
that
we
would
be
in
time
to
have
any
hand
in
the
encounter
if
one
took
place
between
the
pawnees
and
their
hereditary
foes
we
kept
on
until
we
reached
the
crest
of
the
high
bluff
from
here
we
could
see
far
off
over
the
plain
dozens
of
black
dots
strung
out
after
one
another
nearer
at
hand
other
indians
whose
steeds
like
ours
had
proved
too
slow
for
the
swift
pursuit
were
riding
back
toward
us
showing
in
their
faces
the
disappointment
which
they
felt
at
being
left
behind
with
these
we
turned
about
and
rode
toward
the
camp
among
them
was
one
of
the
herd
boys
for
the
moment
a
hero
who
had
to
repeat
his
story
again
and
again
he
had
been
sitting
on
top
of
a
hill
not
far
from
the
horses
when
he
discovered
several
sioux
stealing
toward
them
through
a
ravine
signaling
his
comrades
they
succeeded
in
getting
the
herd
in
motion
before
the
robbers
had
approached
very
close
to
them
eight
of
the
slowest
horses
had
dropped
behind
during
the
flight
and
had
no
doubt
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
one
by
one
the
indians
came
straggling
back
to
camp
during
the
afternoon
and
evening
but
it
was
not
until
late
that
night
that
the
main
body
of
the
pursuers
came
in
they
had
ten
extra
horses
two
of
which
they
had
taken
in
turn
from
the
sioux
they
had
no
scalps
however
for
they
had
been
unable
to
overtake
the
enemy
long
we
sat
that
night
by
the
fire
in
lodge
talking
over
the
exciting
event
of
the
afternoon
and
as
we
rose
to
go
to
our
wagons
and
said
good
night
the
old
man
who
had
been
silently
gazing
into
the
coals
for
some
time
looked
up
at
me
and
smiled
saying
we
will
kill
buffalo
when
we
turned
out
of
our
blankets
the
next
morning
a
heavy
mist
hung
over
the
prairie
this
was
unfortunate
for
so
long
as
the
fog
lasted
it
would
be
impossible
for
the
scouts
to
see
far
enough
to
discover
the
buffalo
the
first
few
hours
of
the
march
were
uneventful
once
or
twice
the
huge
bodies
of
a
small
band
of
buffalo
loomed
up
through
the
white
mist
about
us
their
size
and
shape
greatly
exaggerated
and
distorted
by
its
deceptive
effect
as
the
sun
climbed
toward
the
zenith
the
air
grew
brighter
and
by
the
fog
had
risen
from
the
ground
and
though
still
clinging
in
white
cottony
wreaths
about
the
tops
of
the
higher
bluffs
near
us
we
now
could
see
for
quite
a
long
distance
over
the
prairie
a
little
later
the
sun
burst
forth
and
the
sky
became
clear
soon
after
noon
we
went
into
camp
we
had
but
just
begun
our
dinner
when
a
runner
was
seen
coming
at
full
gallop
down
the
bluffs
it
was
one
of
the
scouts
he
dashed
through
the
village
and
did
not
check
his
pony
speed
until
he
had
reached
old
lodge
here
he
stopped
and
bending
from
his
horse
spoke
a
few
words
very
earnestly
gesticulating
and
pointing
back
over
the
prairie
in
the
direction
whence
he
had
come
as
he
rode
on
and
past
us
he
called
out
i
saw
many
buffalo
and
we
shouted
back
to
him
it
is
good
at
once
the
women
began
to
take
down
the
lodges
and
pack
the
ponies
buffalo
had
been
discovered
about
fifteen
miles
to
the
southwest
and
orders
had
been
issued
to
move
the
village
to
the
creek
on
which
they
were
feeding
while
the
men
should
go
on
at
once
and
make
the
surround
our
teamster
to
whom
the
indians
had
already
from
his
occupation
given
the
name
jackass
chief
was
directed
to
move
with
the
camp
and
leaving
everything
save
guns
and
ammunition
belts
in
the
wagons
we
joined
the
crowd
of
men
who
were
riding
out
of
the
village
the
scene
that
we
now
beheld
was
such
as
might
have
been
witnessed
here
a
hundred
years
ago
it
is
one
that
can
never
be
seen
again
here
were
eight
hundred
warriors
stark
naked
and
mounted
on
naked
animals
a
strip
of
rawhide
or
a
lariat
knotted
about
the
lower
jaw
was
all
their
horses
furniture
among
all
these
men
there
was
not
a
gun
nor
a
pistol
nor
any
indication
that
they
had
ever
met
with
the
white
men
for
the
moment
they
had
put
aside
whatever
they
had
learned
of
civilization
their
bows
and
arrows
they
held
in
their
hands
armed
with
these
ancestral
weapons
they
had
become
once
more
the
simple
children
of
the
plains
about
to
slay
the
wild
cattle
that
had
given
them
for
food
here
was
barbarism
pure
and
simple
here
was
nature
a
brief
halt
was
made
on
the
upper
prairie
until
all
the
riders
had
come
up
and
then
at
a
moderate
gallop
we
set
off
a
few
yards
in
advance
rode
the
soldiers
at
first
curbing
in
their
spirited
little
steeds
till
the
horses
chins
almost
touched
their
chests
and
occasionally
by
a
simple
motion
of
the
hand
waving
back
some
impetuous
boy
who
pressed
too
close
upon
them
many
of
the
indians
led
a
spare
horse
still
riding
the
one
that
had
carried
them
through
the
day
often
two
men
would
be
seen
mounted
on
the
same
animal
the
one
behind
having
the
lariats
of
two
led
horses
wound
about
his
arm
here
and
there
a
man
with
his
arm
over
the
neck
would
run
along
on
foot
by
the
side
of
the
animal
which
was
to
serve
him
in
the
charge
as
we
proceeded
the
pace
became
gradually
a
little
more
rapid
the
horses
went
along
easily
and
without
effort
each
naked
indian
seemed
a
part
of
his
steed
and
rose
and
fell
with
it
in
the
rhythmic
swing
of
its
stride
the
plain
was
peopled
with
centaurs
out
over
each
horse
croup
floated
the
long
black
hair
of
his
rider
spread
out
on
the
wings
of
the
breeze
gradually
the
slow
gallop
became
a
fast
one
the
flanks
of
the
horses
showed
here
and
there
patches
of
wet
which
glistened
in
the
slanting
rays
of
the
westering
sun
eight
ten
a
dozen
miles
had
been
left
behind
us
and
we
were
approaching
the
top
of
a
high
bluff
when
the
signal
was
given
to
halt
in
a
moment
every
man
was
off
his
horse
but
not
a
pony
of
them
all
showed
any
sign
of
distress
nor
gave
any
evidence
of
the
work
he
had
done
except
by
his
wet
flanks
and
his
slightly
accelerated
breathing
two
or
three
of
the
soldiers
rode
up
nearly
to
the
top
of
the
hill
dismounted
and
then
peered
over
and
a
moment
later
at
another
signal
all
mounted
and
the
swift
gallop
began
again
over
the
ridge
we
passed
down
the
smooth
slope
and
across
a
wide
level
plain
where
the
prairie
dogs
and
the
owls
and
the
rattlesnakes
had
their
home
through
the
dog
town
we
hurried
on
thundering
hoofs
no
doubt
amazing
the
dogs
and
perhaps
even
arousing
some
slight
interest
in
the
sluggish
stupid
snakes
bad
places
these
to
ride
through
at
such
a
pace
for
a
little
carelessness
on
your
horse
part
might
cost
him
a
broken
leg
and
you
an
ugly
tumble
but
no
one
took
much
thought
of
dog
town
or
horse
or
possible
accident
for
the
minds
of
all
were
upon
the
next
high
ridge
behind
which
we
felt
sure
that
the
buffalo
would
be
found
and
so
it
proved
just
before
reaching
it
we
were
again
halted
two
of
the
soldiers
reconnoitered
and
then
signaled
that
the
buffalo
were
in
sight
the
tired
horses
were
now
turned
loose
and
the
extra
ones
mounted
as
we
rode
slowly
up
over
the
ridge
we
saw
spread
out
before
us
a
wide
valley
black
with
buffalo
two
miles
away
on
the
other
side
rose
steep
ragged
bluffs
up
which
the
clumsy
buffalo
would
make
but
slow
progress
while
the
ponies
could
run
there
nearly
as
fast
as
on
level
ground
it
was
the
very
place
that
would
have
been
chosen
for
a
surround
at
least
a
thousand
buffalo
were
lying
down
in
the
midst
of
this
amphitheater
here
and
there
away
from
the
main
herd
on
the
lower
hills
were
old
bulls
singly
and
by
twos
and
threes
some
of
them
quietly
chewing
the
cud
others
sullenly
pawing
up
the
dust
or
grinding
their
battered
horns
into
the
yellow
dirt
of
the
hillsides
not
the
slightest
notice
was
taken
of
us
as
we
rode
down
the
slope
at
a
pace
that
was
almost
a
run
but
still
held
in
check
by
the
soldiers
the
orders
for
the
charge
had
not
yet
been
given
our
line
was
now
much
more
extended
than
it
had
been
each
man
pressing
as
far
forward
as
he
dared
and
those
on
either
flank
being
so
far
ahead
of
the
center
that
they
were
almost
on
a
line
with
the
soldiers
we
had
covered
perhaps
half
the
distance
between
the
hilltop
and
the
buffalo
when
some
of
the
outlying
bulls
seemed
to
observe
us
and
after
looking
for
a
moment
or
two
these
started
in
rapid
flight
this
attracted
the
attention
of
the
herd
and
when
we
were
yet
half
a
mile
from
them
they
took
the
alarm
at
once
all
were
on
their
feet
for
a
moment
they
gazed
bewildered
at
the
dark
line
that
was
sweeping
toward
them
and
then
down
went
every
huge
head
and
up
flew
every
little
tail
and
the
herd
was
off
in
a
headlong
stampede
for
the
opposite
hills
as
they
sprang
to
their
feet
the
oldest
man
of
the
soldiers
who
was
riding
in
the
center
of
the
line
turned
back
toward
us
and
uttered
a
shrill
it
was
the
word
we
had
waited
for
like
an
arrow
from
a
bow
each
horse
darted
forward
now
all
restraint
was
removed
and
each
man
might
do
his
best
what
had
been
only
a
wild
gallop
became
a
mad
race
each
rider
hoped
to
be
the
first
to
reach
the
top
of
the
opposite
ridge
and
to
turn
the
buffalo
back
into
the
valley
so
that
the
surround
might
be
completely
successful
how
swift
those
little
ponies
were
and
how
admirably
the
indians
managed
to
get
out
of
them
all
their
speed
i
had
not
gone
much
more
than
across
the
valley
when
i
saw
the
leading
indians
pass
the
head
of
the
herd
and
begin
to
turn
the
buffalo
this
was
the
first
object
of
the
chase
for
in
a
stampede
the
cows
and
young
are
always
in
the
lead
the
bulls
bringing
up
the
rear
this
position
is
not
taken
from
chivalric
motives
on
the
part
of
the
males
but
simply
because
they
can
not
run
so
fast
as
their
wives
and
children
bulls
are
never
killed
when
cows
and
heifers
can
be
had
back
came
the
herd
and
i
soon
found
myself
in
the
midst
of
a
throng
of
buffalo
horses
and
indians
there
was
no
yelling
nor
shouting
on
the
part
of
the
men
but
their
stern
set
faces
and
the
fierce
gleam
of
their
eyes
told
of
the
fires
of
excitement
that
were
burning
within
them
three
or
four
times
my
rifle
spoke
out
and
to
some
purpose
and
one
shot
placed
too
far
back
drew
on
me
a
quick
savage
charge
from
a
vicious
young
cow
my
pony
while
a
good
cattle
horse
was
new
at
buffalo
running
and
his
deliberation
in
the
matter
of
dodging
caused
me
an
anxious
second
or
two
as
i
saw
the
cow
head
sweep
close
to
his
flank
it
was
far
more
interesting
to
watch
the
scene
than
to
take
part
in
it
and
i
soon
rode
to
a
little
knoll
from
which
i
could
overlook
the
whole
plain
many
brown
bodies
lay
stretched
upon
the
ground
and
many
more
were
dashing
here
and
there
closely
attended
by
relentless
pursuers
it
was
sad
to
see
so
much
death
but
the
people
must
have
food
and
none
of
this
meat
would
be
wasted
before
i
turned
my
horse
head
toward
the
camp
the
broad
disk
of
the
setting
sun
had
rested
on
the
tops
of
the
western
bluffs
and
tipped
their
crests
with
fire
his
horizontal
beams
lit
up
with
a
picturesque
redness
the
dusky
forms
which
moved
about
over
the
valley
up
the
ravines
and
over
the
hills
were
stringing
long
lines
of
squaws
leading
patient
ponies
whose
backs
were
piled
high
with
dark
dripping
meat
and
with
soft
shaggy
skins
late
into
the
night
the
work
continued
and
the
loads
kept
coming
into
the
camp
about
the
flickering
fires
in
and
before
the
lodges
there
was
feasting
and
merriment
marrow
bones
were
tossed
among
the
red
embers
calf
head
was
baked
in
the
hot
earth
fat
ribs
were
roasted
boiled
and
eaten
raw
with
laughter
and
singing
and
story
telling
and
dance
the
night
wore
away
over
the
plain
where
the
buffalo
had
fallen
the
gray
wolf
was
prowling
and
with
the
coyote
the
fox
and
the
badger
tore
at
the
bones
of
the
slain
when
day
came
the
golden
eagle
and
the
buzzard
perched
upon
the
naked
red
skeletons
and
took
their
toll
and
far
away
to
the
southward
a
few
frightened
buffalo
some
of
which
had
arrows
sticking
in
their
sore
sides
were
cropping

the
pawnee
in
war
i
enemies
and
methods
of
warfare
the
pawnees
were
a
race
of
warriors
war
was
their
pleasure
and
their
business
by
war
they
gained
credit
respect
fame
by
war
they
acquired
wealth
on
their
long
journey
from
their
primitive
home
in
the
far
southwest
they
must
have
met
fought
with
and
conquered
many
tribes
by
conquest
so
says
tradition
they
obtained
their
first
horses
captured
no
one
knows
how
long
ago
in
an
attack
on
a
cheyenne
village
they
were
brave
men
but
brave
after
their
own
peculiar
fashion
their
courage
was
not
displayed
in
the
same
way
as
that
of
the
white
man
they
thought
it
folly
to
expose
themselves
unnecessarily
an
enemy
was
to
be
surprised
and
killed
while
asleep
if
possible
or
shot
through
by
an
arrow
from
behind
to
meet
him
in
what
we
call
fair
fight
when
there
was
a
chance
to
kill
him
from
an
ambush
would
have
seemed
an
insane
or
desperate
proceeding
and
yet
as
has
been
shown
by
some
of
the
stories
already
narrated
they
often
faced
death
with
a
calmness
and
an
indifference
which
indicated
the
highest
physical
courage
it
has
been
very
well
said
that
the
purpose
of
the
indian
in
his
warfare
was
to
inflict
the
greatest
amount
of
injury
on
his
enemy
with
the
least
possible
risk
to
himself
in
the
old
time
wars
the
participants
exercised
the
greatest
prudence
and
caution
they
took
no
risks
where
risks
could
be
avoided
it
was
more
glorious
for
a
war
party
to
kill
a
single
enemy
without
receiving
a
wound
than
to
kill
a
dozen
if
thereby
they
lost
a
man
the
warrior
who
led
out
a
war
party
and
brought
it
back
without
loss
received
credit
his
skill
as
a
leader
was
praised
and
his
influence
grew
a
leader
who
lost
men
lost
also
prestige
the
chiefs
withdrew
their
confidence
from
him
the
young
men
might
decline
after
that
to
join
his
party
when
the
pawnees
came
into
the
northern
country
they
found
it
occupied
by
the
poncas
the
omahas
and
the
otoes
according
to
their
custom
they
attacked
these
tribes
and
after
a
resistance
more
or
less
prolonged
conquered
them
the
poncas
appear
to
have
made
the
most
stubborn
fight
against
the
invaders
and
it
is
related
that
they
made
an
alliance
with
the
sioux
against
their
common
enemy
from
time
to
time
there
would
be
a
cessation
of
hostilities
and
peace
would
be
made
but
this
never
endured
long
there
still
exists
among
the
pawnees
a
triumph
song
composed
after
a
treacherous
attack
on
the
pawnees
by
the
poncas
during
a
time
of
peace
dunbar
remarks
on
this
song
are
so
interesting
that
i
quote
them
in
full
he
says
the
pawnee
has
a
song
constituting
the
finest
satirical
production
in
the
language
relating
to
an
attempt
that
the
poncas
are
said
to
have
once
made
to
recover
their
independence
their
warriors
in
a
body
so
the
account
states
made
a
pretended
visit
of
peace
to
the
village
of
at
that
time
the
head
band
of
the
pawnees
after
lulling
to
rest
as
they
supposed
the
suspicions
of
the
according
to
a
preconcerted
plan
they
made
an
attack
on
them
but
were
signally
discomfited
in
commemoration
of
the
victory
then
achieved
the
pawnees
composed
this
song
and
the
presumption
is
that
such
a
remarkable
production
would
not
have
originated
and
maintained
its
position
permanently
in
their
minds
without
a
good
historic
basis
this
is
the
song
aha
you
ponca
it
was
pretended
peace
did
you
find
what
you
were
laughing
at
me
about
you
meant
fight
the
keen
satire
of
the
interrogation
is
exquisite
it
conceives
of
the
poncas
as
quietly
laughing
in
their
sleeves
during
their
ostensibly
amicable
visit
in
anticipation
of
the
summary
retribution
that
they
expected
to
inflict
upon
their
oppressors
at
last
the
poncas
omahas
and
otoes
were
effectively
subjugated
and
were
permitted
to
live
on
the
borders
of
the
pawnee
territory
and
under
the
of
that
tribe
in
the
old
days
before
the
coming
of
the
whites
the
pawnees
had
no
enemies
near
at
hand
they
had
conquered
all
surrounding
nations
and
claimed
and
held
the
country
from
the
missouri
river
to
the
rocky
mountains
and
from
the
niobrara
south
to
the
arkansas
river
or
to
the
canadian
then
when
they
wished
to
go
to
war
they
were
forced
to
journey
either
to
the
rocky
mountains
to
fight
the
utes
or
up
the
missouri
to
attack
the
crows
or
down
into
mexico
to
plunder
the
spaniards
or
into
texas
to
steal
horses
from
the
comanches
the
wichitas
and
other
southern
tribes
then
the
war
parties
were
great
bodies
sometimes
one
thousand
men
and
all
on
foot
afterward
as
settlements
approached
them
and
other
tribes
were
driven
into
their
country
and
the
different
pawnee
bands
were
crowded
together
their
campaigns
diminished
in
importance
the
war
parties
became
smaller
and
smaller
until
at
last
only
half
a
dozen
men
would
start
out
and
sometimes
a
single
individual
would
go
off
by
himself
to
steal
horses
the
pawnees
were
true
ishmaelites
they
had
no
friends
upon
the
prairies
save
those
whom
they
had
conquered
and
held
by
fear
foes
swarmed
about
them
to
the
north
were
the
different
bands
of
the
dakotas
and
the
crows
to
the
west
the
utes
with
the
arapahoes
the
kiowas
and
the
cheyennes
and
to
the
south
the
comanches
cheyennes
kiowas
kansas
osages
and
their
relations
the
wichitas
with
these
last
they
were
long
at
war
for
the
pawnees
and
wichitas
had
forgotten
each
other
existence
or
rather
each
tribe
was
wholly
ignorant
as
to
what
had
become
of
the
other
only
a
tradition
of
the
old
relationship
still
remained
the
kinship
was
rediscovered
within
the
last
thirty
years
when
some
kaws
came
north
on
a
visit
to
the
pawnee
village
and
brought
with
them
a
wichita
who
had
been
visiting
at
the
kaw
agency
the
pawnees
found
that
this
man
spoke
a
language
nearly
like
their
own
and
at
length
discovered
that
the
wichitas
were
a
part
of
their
own
people
attempts
were
made
to
establish
a
peace
and
to
renew
their
old
friendly
relations
but
the
fact
that
the
wichitas
were
so
closely
allied
to
the
comanches
kiowas
and
cheyennes
made
it
very
difficult
for
the
tribes
to
come
together
on
a
friendly
footing
hostilities
still
continued
therefore
nor
was
a
lasting
peace
made
until
the
visit
of
already
described
as
a
result
of
this
well
nigh
universal
hostility
the
pawnees
were
constantly
being
attacked
and
were
constantly
losing
men
women
and
children
dunbar
who
has
taken
pains
to
collect
some
facts
bearing
on
this
point
says
probably
not
a
year
in
this
century
has
been
without
losses
from
this
source
warfare
though
only
occasionally
have
they
been
marked
with
considerable
disasters
in
the
skidi
band
suffered
a
severe
defeat
on
the
arkansas
from
the
comanches
in
a
dakota
war
party
numbering
over
seven
hundred
attacked
a
village
occupied
by
two
hundred
and
sixteen
pawnees
and
succeeded
in
killing
in
a
party
of
one
hundred
and
thirteen
were
cut
off
by
an
overwhelming
body
of
cheyennes
and
kiowas
and
killed
almost
to
a
man
in
a
hunting
party
of
about
four
hundred
two
hundred
and
thirteen
of
whom
were
men
on
the
republican
while
in
the
act
of
killing
a
herd
of
buffalo
were
attacked
by
nearly
six
hundred
dakota
warriors
and
were
killed
but
the
usual
policy
of
their
enemies
has
been
to
cut
off
individual
or
small
scattered
parties
while
engaged
in
the
chase
or
in
tilling
isolated
corn
patches
losses
of
this
kind
trifling
when
taken
singly
have
in
the
aggregate
borne
heavily
on
the
tribe
it
would
seem
that
such
losses
annually
recurring
should
have
taught
them
to
be
more
on
their
guard
but
let
it
be
remembered
that
the
struggle
has
not
been
in
one
direction
against
one
enemy
the
dakotas
crows
kiowas
cheyennes
arapahoes
comanches
osages
and
kansas
have
faithfully
aided
each
other
though
undesignedly
in
the
main
in
this
crusade
of
extermination
against
the
pawnee
it
has
been
in
the
most
emphatic
sense
a
struggle
of
the
one
against
the
many
with
the
possible
exception
of
the
dakotas
there
is
much
reason
to
believe
that
the
animosity
of
these
tribes
has
been
exacerbated
by
the
galling
tradition
of
disastrous
defeats
which
pawnee
prowess
had
inflicted
upon
themselves
in
past
generations
to
them
the
last
seventy
years
have
been
a
carnival
of
revenge
dunbar
regards
the
constant
warfare
against
their
many
enemies
as
one
principal
cause
of
the
rapid
diminution
in
numbers
of
the
pawnees
and
no
doubt
it
was
a
cause
but
a
far
more
important
one
was
the
sapping
of
the
tribe
vitality
by
contact
with
the
whites
their
villages
lay
almost
directly
in
the
path
of
emigration
and
it
was
the
introduction
of
spirits
and
the
special
diseases
contracted
from
the
whites
which
weakened
the
tribe
and
made
the
tough
and
sinewy
pawnee
a
ready
prey
to
sickness
and
death
although
so
ferocious
to
people
of
their
own
color
the
pawnees
have
ever
been
at
peace
with
the
whites
bad
men
among
them
have
no
doubt
sometimes
stolen
horses
but
the
tribe
has
never
carried
on
an
organized
war
against
the
government
while
they
have
often
been
provoked
by
wanton
outrages
inflicted
on
them
yet
they
have
always
borne
themselves
peaceably
and
mildly
and
sought
redress
by
legal
or
persuasive
rather
than
by
hostile
measures
there
is
one
instance
on
record
which
while
it
shows
their
ferocity
exemplifies
also
their
natural
justice
and
deserves
to
be
repeated
this
is
the
story
of
the
rawhide
in
the
year
among
a
small
party
of
emigrants
who
were
crossing
the
plains
on
their
way
to
california
was
a
man
who
had
frequently
asserted
that
he
would
kill
the
first
indian
he
saw
while
the
train
was
camped
on
a
small
creek
flowing
into
the
elkhorn
a
young
squaw
was
seen
who
belonged
to
the
neighboring
village
some
accounts
say
that
she
came
to
the
camp
to
beg
others
that
she
was
going
to
the
stream
for
a
bucket
of
water
at
all
events
she
was
seen
by
the
emigrants
who
bantered
the
young
man
to
carry
out
his
boast
that
he
would
kill
the
first
indian
he
saw
he
shot
and
killed
the
woman
the
train
moved
on
during
the
night
on
the
following
day
the
tribe
learned
of
this
wanton
butchery
they
pursued
the
train
and
surrounding
it
demanded
the
murderer
he
was
at
once
given
up
and
a
council
was
held
at
which
his
fate
was
decided
the
train
was
ordered
back
to
the
scene
of
the
murder
and
there
in
the
presence
of
his
horrified
companions
the
pawnees
proceeded
to
flay
the
murderer
alive
after
this
had
been
done
the
emigrants
were
permitted
to
proceed
on
their
journey
the
stream
on
whose
banks
this
act
of
grim
justice
took
place
is
still
known
as
rawhide
creek
not
only
have
the
pawnees
never
been
at
war
with
the
whites
but
for
the
past
years
they
have
been
their
allies
in
every
serious
indian
war
which
has
taken
place
east
of
the
rocky
mountains
the
pawnee
was
taught
to
deal
in
ambuscades
and
surprises
yet
he
could
fight
in
the
open
too
if
necessity
demanded
sometimes
they
had
pitched
battles
with
their
foes
but
their
weapons
were
very
primitive
and
such
combats
were
in
view
of
the
numbers
engaged
on
either
side
comparatively
bloodless
between
the
years
and
such
battles
frequently
took
place
near
the
pawnee
village
when
the
sioux
who
were
far
more
numerous
than
the
pawnees
would
come
down
from
the
north
to
try
to
destroy
the
village
many
a
time
i
have
heard
from
the
lips
of
grizzled
warriors
the
stories
of
these
battles
sometimes
the
enemy
would
come
down
in
small
parties
and
steal
horses
or
kill
squaws
who
were
working
in
the
corn
patches
but
at
other
times
large
bodies
of
warriors
would
approach
the
village
without
any
attempt
at
concealment
about
sunrise
the
sioux
would
ride
up
over
the
hills
in
a
line
fronting
toward
the
village
they
appeared
mounted
on
their
best
ponies
clad
in
their
most
elaborate
war
costume
and
wearing
long
war
bonnets
of
the
feathers
of
the
war
eagle
which
almost
swept
the
ground
as
their
horses
curveted
along
to
the
music
of
the
monotonous
but
thrilling
war
chant
at
the
instant
of
their
appearance
the
pawnee
village
would
begin
to
stir
like
a
disturbed
ant
hill
the
shouts
of
command
by
the
men
the
piercing
calls
from
women
the
alarmed
and
excited
shrieks
of
the
children
the
neighing
and
heavy
of
the
horses
the
barking
and
howling
of
the
dogs
as
they
were
kicked
out
of
the
way
made
a
very
babel
of
sounds
the
men
snatched
their
arms
and
springing
on
their
horses
rode
out
on
to
the
plain
to
meet
the
enemy
while
the
women
and
children
after
the
horses
had
been
secured
mounted
to
the
tops
of
the
dirt
lodges
to
watch
the
fight
the
sioux
when
they
had
come
into
full
view
stopped
and
sat
there
on
their
horses
proud
of
their
brave
attire
and
courting
admiration
the
pawnees
too
if
time
permitted
would
don
their
finest
war
dresses
though
often
they
fought
naked
and
elaborately
paint
themselves
and
their
horses
as
the
pawnees
rode
toward
their
enemy
the
sioux
slowly
advanced
toward
them
both
with
extended
front
each
party
chanted
its
songs
of
war
and
uttered
yells
of
defiance
while
they
were
still
six
or
seven
hundred
yards
apart
they
halted
and
stood
facing
each
other
after
a
short
wait
a
warrior
from
one
side
or
the
other
rode
out
before
the
line
and
addressed
his
party
he
opened
his
speech
with
some
remarks
derogatory
to
the
foe
and
in
praise
of
his
own
people
from
these
generalities
he
passed
to
a
consideration
of
his
own
excellent
qualities
told
of
what
he
had
done
in
the
past
and
what
he
now
intended
doing
and
when
he
had
finished
speaking
he
bent
low
over
his
horse
neck
and
rode
furiously
toward
one
end
of
the
enemy
line
when
he
had
come
within
easy
bowshot
he
usually
turned
his
horse
head
and
rode
as
hard
as
he
could
down
along
the
line
leaning
down
half
hidden
by
his
horse
and
discharging
arrow
after
arrow
at
the
enemy
they
also
shot
at
him
as
he
flew
by
and
as
he
rode
along
those
whom
he
had
passed
dashed
out
in
pursuit
until
the
whole
party
were
riding
after
him
as
hard
as
they
could
go
if
he
passed
along
the
line
without
injury
he
turned
his
horse
toward
his
own
party
and
rode
back
his
pursuers
following
him
but
a
short
distance
if
however
he
was
wounded
by
the
arrows
shot
at
him
and
fell
from
his
horse
or
if
his
horse
was
hit
and
disabled
or
if
on
account
of
the
greater
speed
of
their
ponies
it
seemed
likely
that
the
enemy
would
overtake
him
the
whole
body
of
his
tribe
made
a
headlong
charge
to
rescue
and
bring
him
off
the
enemy
were
as
eager
to
take
his
scalp
as
his
own
people
were
to
save
it
and
the
opposing
warriors
came
together
in
a
hot
melee
there
was
little
twanging
of
bow
strings
and
not
much
thrusting
of
lances
for
the
most
part
the
fighting
was
at
quarters
too
close
for
this
and
the
combatants
pounded
at
each
other
heads
with
hatchets
war
clubs
whip
handles
bows
and
sticks
bruises
were
given
and
received
sometimes
a
few
men
were
gashed
with
hatchets
and
lances
and
occasionally
a
man
was
killed
if
the
man
about
whom
the
struggle
was
taking
place
was
scalped
his
party
at
once
drew
off
leaving
his
body
which
had
now
ceased
to
have
any
interest
for
them
in
the
hands
of
the
enemy
if
however
he
escaped
scalping
his
friends
and
foes
soon
separated
and
withdrew
to
their
former
positions
then
after
a
breathing
spell
a
man
of
the
other
party
rode
forward
and
made
his
speech
and
the
charge
and
general
attack
might
be
repeated
occasionally
a
very
daring
or
desperate
man
instead
of
riding
down
the
opposing
line
would
charge
through
it
and
as
he
reached
it
would
let
fly
an
arrow
at
some
particular
man
and
count
on
and
scalp
him
as
he
dashed
by
he
would
at
once
be
surrounded
by
foes
who
did
their
best
to
kill
him
while
his
own
tribesmen
would
charge
upon
them
and
for
a
short
time
the
struggle
would
be
very
fierce
a
brave
man
killed
and
scalped
was
mutilated
in
all
conceivable
ways
by
the
enemy
and
was
often
cut
up
into
small
pieces
in
this
way
the
battle
might
go
on
for
the
greater
part
of
a
day
with
varying
fortunes
but
without
the
loss
on
either
side
of
more
than
a
man
or
two
until
at
last
one
party
or
the
other
would
become
discouraged
and
would
break
and
run
the
sioux
in
their
attacks
on
the
pawnee
village
were
never
the
victors
they
were
always
defeated
and
driven
back
and
often
in
the
pursuit
two
or
three
times
as
many
men
were
killed
as
in
the
actual
battle
it
was
but
natural
that
the
pawnees
should
have
been
successful
in
this
defense
of
their
village
for
in
such
fights
they
felt
that
they
must
conquer
defeat
to
them
there
meant
the
loss
of
all
that
they
possessed
the
slaughter
of
their
women
and
children
and
the
destruction
of
their
village
besides
if
defeated
they
had
no
place
to
retreat
to
they
would
fight
to
the
death
their
fierce
courage
and
their
fighting
qualities
were
well
shown
on
one
famous
occasion
the
tribe
had
gone
off
south
on
the
buffalo
hunt
and
there
were
left
in
the
village
only
some
of
the
sick
the
old
men
and
a
few
boys
women
and
children
among
the
sick
who
remained
was
crooked
hand
a
skidi
brave
recognized
as
a
leader
in
battle
and
one
of
the
bravest
warriors
in
the
tribe
the
sioux
had
learned
of
the
departure
of
the
pawnees
with
all
the
fighting
men
and
had
planned
to
come
down
kill
all
the
people
left
at
home
and
destroy
the
village
one
morning
to
the
dismay
of
those
who
had
been
left
behind
six
hundred
of
the
very
best
of
the
sioux
warriors
rode
slowly
into
view
over
the
hills
and
down
on
to
the
plain
above
the
village
they
made
no
charge
for
it
was
unnecessary
to
hurry
about
killing
the
few
women
the
old
men
and
the
sick
who
were
to
be
their
unresisting
victims
they
wished
to
prolong
the
agony
of
these
wretched
pawnees
whose
scalps
were
already
theirs
and
whose
village
would
soon
be
only
a
few
heaps
of
smoking
ruins
as
they
rode
slowly
down
the
hill
there
was
no
clink
of
steel
nor
rattle
of
harness
only
the
soft
rustling
of
the
prairie
grass
under
the
unshod
hoofs
of
their
spirited
war
ponies
but
this
sound
was
drowned
by
the
ominous
music
of
their
triumphant
war
song
which
now
loud
now
low
was
faintly
borne
on
the
breeze
to
the
fated
village
very
deliberately
they
came
on
singing
as
they
marched
proudly
like
conquerors
while
the
sun
glittered
on
polished
and
gleaming
hair
plate
and
the
wind
blew
out
the
fringes
of
their
white
war
shirts
or
gaily
tossed
the
streaming
plumes
of
their
superb
war
bonnets
the
news
of
their
appearance
was
brought
to
crooked
hand
where
he
lay
sick
in
his
lodge
at
once
he
threw
aside
the
robe
in
which
he
was
wrapped
and
as
he
rose
to
his
feet
he
cast
away
from
him
by
the
same
motion
his
sickness
his
orders
were
quickly
issued
and
as
promptly
obeyed
the
village
must
fight
tottering
old
men
whose
sinews
were
now
too
feeble
to
bend
the
bow
seized
their
long
disused
arms
and
clambered
on
their
horses
boys
too
young
to
hunt
whose
bodies
had
never
been
toughened
by
the
long
journeys
of
the
warpath
whose
hearts
had
not
been
made
strong
by
the
first
fast
grasped
the
weapons
that
they
had
as
yet
used
only
on
rabbits
and
ground
squirrels
flung
themselves
on
their
ponies
and
rode
with
the
old
men
even
squaws
taking
what
weapons
they
could
axes
hoes
mauls
pestles
mounted
horses
and
marshaled
themselves
for
battle
the
force
for
the
defense
numbered
two
hundred
superannuated
old
men
boys
and
women
among
them
all
were
not
perhaps
ten
active
warriors
and
these
had
just
risen
from
sick
beds
to
take
their
place
in
the
line
of
battle
but
then
this
little
force
had
a
leader
crooked
hand
mounted
on
a
superb
war
pony
was
as
cool
and
unconcerned
as
if
he
were
about
to
ride
out
to
a
band
of
buffalo
instead
of
leading
a
force
of
old
men
and
children
against
six
hundred
of
the
best
warriors
that
the
sioux
could
muster
at
that
time
the
pawnee
village
was
encompassed
by
a
high
sod
wall
and
some
of
crooked
hand
people
wished
to
await
the
charge
of
the
sioux
behind
this
shelter
but
their
leader
would
not
permit
this
he
said
to
them
we
can
conquer
the
sioux
anywhere
so
led
his
forces
out
to
meet
the
attack
in
fair
open
combat
on
the
plain
on
the
same
ground
where
so
many
times
the
pawnees
had
routed
their
enemies
as
the
pawnees
passed
out
of
the
village
on
to
the
plain
the
sioux
saw
for
the
first
time
the
force
they
had
to
meet
they
laughed
in
derision
calling
out
bitter
jibes
and
telling
what
they
would
do
when
they
had
made
the
charge
and
as
crooked
hand
heard
their
laughter
he
smiled
too
but
not
mirthfully
he
knew
what
perhaps
the
sioux
had
forgotten
that
his
people
were
and
that
they
would
fight
until
they
died
their
strokes
would
be
for
their
homes
and
lives
the
battle
began
it
seemed
like
an
unequal
fight
surely
one
charge
would
be
enough
to
overthrow
this
motley
pawnee
throng
who
had
ventured
out
to
try
to
oppose
the
triumphal
march
of
the
sioux
but
it
was
not
ended
so
quickly
the
fight
began
about
the
middle
of
the
morning
and
to
the
amazement
of
the
sioux
these
old
men
with
shrunken
shanks
and
piping
voices
these
children
with
their
small
white
teeth
and
soft
round
limbs
these
women
clad
in
skirts
and
armed
with
hoes
held
the
invaders
where
they
were
they
could
make
no
advance
a
little
latter
it
became
evident
that
the
pawnees
were
driving
the
sioux
back
presently
this
backward
movement
became
a
retreat
the
retreat
a
rout
the
rout
a
wild
panic
then
indeed
the
pawnees
made
a
great
killing
of
their
enemies
many
an
old
man
whose
feeble
legs
had
long
refused
to
bear
him
on
the
warpath
again
quavered
his
war
cry
again
counted
upon
his
enemy
many
a
boy
who
had
never
shed
the
blood
of
any
creature
larger
than
a
prairie
chicken
that
day
struck
his
enemy
and
with
shrill
childish
voice
shouted
his
whoop
of
triumph
as
he
tore
away
the
reeking
scalp
more
than
one
woman
used
only
to
pounding
corn
and
dressing
robes
that
day
counted
her
and
when
the
tribe
returned
told
what
she
had
done
and
changed
her
name
like
a
warrior
to
the
pawnees
that
day
was
like
the
day
of
thermopylæ
to
the
greeks
crooked
hand
preëminent
among
the
heroes
of
that
fight
with
his
own
hand
killed
six
of
the
sioux
and
had
three
horses
shot
under
him
his
wounds
were
many
but
he
laughed
at
them
he
was
content
he
had
saved
the
village
the
same
indomitable
spirit
here
shown
has
characterized
the
pawnees
always
for
generations
they
fought
as
their
fathers
had
fought
in
their
own
way
with
their
native
enemies
but
when
they
were
enlisted
in
the
government
service
and
trained
in
the
white
man
ways
of
war
they
adapted
themselves
readily
to
their
new
conditions
a
body
of
men
braver
than
the
pawnee
scouts
under
major
frank
north
and
his
brother
luther
never
rode
on
horses
they
were
far
better
than
any
white
soldiers
that
ever
fought
on
the
plains
for
besides
their
natural
courage
they
had
at
their
finger
ends
all
the
wonderful
wisdom
of
the
savage
they
could
tell
as
it
seemed
by
instinct
where
a
trail
would
lead
where
the
enemy
that
they
were
pursuing
would
camp
what
were
his
plans
they
had
the
endurance
of
their
prototype
the
wolf
no
labor
was
too
severe
no
journey
too
long
if
its
end
was
a
battle
with
their
foes
their
courage
their
discipline
their
knowledge
of
the
plains
their
acquaintance
with
the
habits
of
their
enemies
their
endurance
made
them
superb
soldiers
but
perhaps
more
than
all
this
and
yet
a
part
of
all
this
was
the
absorbing
devotion
and
trust
which
they
felt
for
their
white
leader
through
all
the
years
that
they
followed
him
he
never
led
them
but
to
victory
through
all
these
years
he
never
lost
a
man
in
battle
and
the
belief
of
the
pawnees
in
his
ability
and
his
success
was
like
the
devotion
felt
by
the
for
napoleon
ii
and
his
scouts
no
account
of
the
pawnees
warfare
would
give
any
just
impression
of
their
prowess
if
it
omitted
to
mention
and
the
forces
which
he
commanded
the
pawnee
scouts
under
the
gallant
and
able
leadership
of
frank
north
did
splendid
service
against
hostile
indians
they
saved
hundreds
of
lives
and
millions
of
dollars
worth
of
property
and
in
their
campaigns
wiped
out
in
blood
the
memory
of
many
an
injury
done
to
their
race
by
the
sioux
the
cheyennes
the
arapahoes
and
the
kiowas
frank
north
was
born
in
ohio
march
when
about
fifteen
years
of
age
he
accompanied
his
family
westward
to
council
bluffs
and
a
little
later
across
the
missouri
river
into
nebraska
at
about
this
time
his
father
who
was
a
surveyor
was
lost
in
a
snow
storm
and
the
responsibility
of
caring
for
his
family
fell
in
large
measure
on
the
boy
soon
after
this
he
obtained
employment
as
clerk
in
the
trader
store
at
the
pawnee
agency
and
thus
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
tribe
his
strong
character
early
brought
him
to
the
notice
of
their
principal
men
and
almost
before
attaining
manhood
he
had
become
a
person
of
influence
in
the
councils
of
the
pawnee
nation
in
the
year
frank
north
was
authorized
to
enlist
a
company
of
pawnee
scouts
to
be
employed
against
the
bands
of
hostile
indians
whose
depredations
were
at
that
time
becoming
very
troublesome
the
command
was
organized
that
autumn
and
did
some
service
along
the
old
emigrant
trail
it
was
not
until
the
summer
of
however
that
it
saw
any
serious
fighting
in
that
year
general
connor
of
california
commanded
a
large
expedition
to
the
powder
river
country
and
the
pawnee
scouts
accompanied
him
and
rendered
brilliant
service
later
during
the
building
of
the
union
pacific
railway
the
depredations
of
the
hostile
sioux
cheyennes
and
arapahoes
became
so
serious
along
the
line
of
the
road
that
the
government
authorized
north
to
enlist
a
battalion
of
scouts
from
the
pawnee
nation
and
offered
him
the
command
with
the
rank
of
major
several
companies
of
these
scouts
were
so
enlisted
and
for
years
the
battalion
did
good
service
on
the
plains
and
in
the
mountains
in
nebraska
kansas
and
wyoming
serving
under
generals
auger
emory
carr
royal
mackenzie
and
crook
some
of
the
most
successful
indian
fighters
in
that
department
the
pawnee
scouts
were
everywhere
and
at
all
times
brave
men
good
soldiers
and
victorious
warriors
the
amount
of
property
saved
to
the
government
the
settlers
and
the
railroad
through
the
efforts
of
major
north
command
can
scarcely
be
computed
in
all
his
service
of
almost
constant
fighting
extending
over
a
period
of
more
than
ten
years
he
never
lost
a
man
on
the
battle
field
and
this
caused
him
to
be
regarded
by
the
pawnees
as
divinely
favored
it
is
impossible
within
the
limits
of
a
few
pages
to
give
even
a
sketch
of
the
services
performed
by
frank
north
and
his
scouts
two
or
three
isolated
episodes
in
his
career
will
show
something
of
the
constant
danger
and
hardship
of
the
life
he
led
and
of
the
courage
coolness
and
determination
of
the
leader
and
his
men
such
an
episode
memorable
alike
for
its
danger
the
completeness
of
the
victory
gained
and
the
fact
that
it
won
for
him
the
title
by
which
he
was
ever
after
known
among
the
pawnees
marked
his
first
campaign
it
was
in
the
powder
river
country
and
captain
north
had
started
with
a
detachment
of
his
scouts
in
pursuit
of
a
party
of
indians
whose
trail
he
had
found
for
some
weeks
his
men
had
been
hard
worked
and
at
this
time
their
horses
were
so
jaded
that
although
they
had
come
within
sight
of
the
cheyennes
they
were
unable
to
overtake
them
and
force
them
to
a
fight
captain
north
who
was
mounted
on
a
fresh
horse
rode
far
ahead
of
his
men
who
were
constantly
falling
further
and
further
behind
at
length
realizing
the
futility
of
continuing
the
pursuit
north
dismounted
fired
a
parting
shot
at
the
indians
and
was
about
to
ride
back
toward
camp
when
the
fleeing
cheyennes
about
in
number
turned
and
charged
him
he
then
discovered
that
he
had
outridden
all
his
men
not
one
of
them
was
in
sight
hastily
dismounting
he
prepared
to
receive
the
enemy
and
firing
as
they
advanced
killed
one
the
rest
sheered
off
and
rode
out
of
rifle
shot
and
then
formed
again
for
another
charge
feeling
for
a
cartridge
to
reload
his
rifle
north
made
the
startling
discovery
that
he
had
but
three
left
all
the
others
having
been
lost
during
his
rapid
ride
he
found
too
that
his
horse
had
been
wounded
by
a
ball
from
the
cheyennes
and
was
in
no
condition
for
running
indeed
it
could
not
be
ridden
his
situation
seemed
well
nigh
hopeless
but
he
prepared
to
make
the
best
of
it
by
retreating
on
foot
leading
his
wounded
horse
as
a
shelter
from
behind
which
to
fight
when
the
cheyennes
charged
him
he
would
face
about
raise
his
gun
to
his
shoulder
as
if
about
to
fire
and
the
indians
who
had
already
tasted
the
quality
of
his
lead
would
drop
down
behind
their
horses
and
sheer
off
never
coming
so
close
to
him
as
to
make
it
necessary
for
him
to
use
one
of
his
precious
cartridges
after
a
long
weary
walk
of
twelve
or
fifteen
miles
during
which
his
feet
were
cruelly
lacerated
by
the
thorns
of
the
cactus
over
which
he
walked
his
pursuers
left
him
and
he
reached
his
command
in
safety
no
sooner
had
he
arrived
at
the
camp
than
taking
a
fresh
horse
and
ordering
out
a
detachment
of
his
men
he
set
out
in
pursuit
of
the
enemy
all
that
afternoon
they
rode
hard
and
when
night
fell
dismounting
a
couple
of
pawnees
to
follow
the
trail
on
foot
the
pursuit
was
still
kept
up
just
after
daylight
as
they
rode
out
into
a
little
park
in
the
mountains
a
tiny
column
of
blue
smoke
rising
from
a
clump
of
cottonwood
trees
showed
where
the
hostiles
were
camped
the
pawnees
rode
steadily
forward
in
double
file
in
military
fashion
and
the
cheyennes
supposing
that
they
were
white
soldiers
jumped
on
their
horses
and
rode
out
on
to
the
open
hillside
where
they
formed
a
line
of
battle
to
meet
the
enemy
the
pawnees
rode
quietly
onward
until
they
were
quite
near
the
cheyennes
and
then
loud
and
clear
their
ringing
war
whoop
broke
out
upon
the
morning
air
when
the
cheyennes
heard
this
which
told
them
that
the
attacking
party
were
pawnees
their
hearts
became
like
water
and
they
turned
and
fled
already
however
seven
of
their
number
had
fallen
before
the
pawnee
bullets
and
the
fresher
horses
of
the
pawnees
easily
overtook
the
tired
ones
ridden
by
the
pursued
of
that
party
of
cheyennes
not
one
escaped
and
with
scalps
and
all
the
plunder
the
victorious
pawnees
returned
that
afternoon
to
their
command
among
the
captured
property
were
horses
and
mules
some
of
which
had
been
taken
from
a
party
of
fifteen
soldiers
killed
to
a
man
by
these
cheyennes
but
a
few
days
before
there
were
also
the
scalps
of
these
soldiers
and
wearing
apparel
belonging
to
white
women
and
children
which
justified
the
belief
that
they
had
recently
massacred
a
party
of
emigrants
it
was
on
the
occasion
of
the
scalp
dance
which
followed
this
victory
and
when
the
scouts
were
changing
their
names
as
was
the
custom
after
a
successful
encounter
with
the
enemy
that
the
pawnees
gave
to
major
north
the
title
chief
of
the
pawnees
a
name
which
has
been
borne
by
only
one
other
white
man
general
john
fremont
the
pathfinder
the
story
of
the
killing
of
tall
bull
and
the
fight
with
turkey
band
of
sioux
illustrate
the
readiness
and
the
daring
of
major
north
in
battle
tall
bull
was
a
chief
who
commanded
a
large
village
of
renegade
sioux
and
cheyennes
who
had
given
great
trouble
by
their
depredations
major
north
with
his
pawnees
and
some
white
united
states
troops
had
been
looking
for
this
village
for
some
time
and
at
length
succeeded
in
surprising
it
near
summit
springs
the
village
was
captured
in
the
charge
and
many
of
the
hostiles
killed
others
fled
or
concealed
themselves
in
the
ravines
and
washouts
which
seamed
the
prairie
and
made
a
desperate
fight
the
pawnees
were
scattered
about
in
little
parties
killing
the
indians
thus
concealed
when
major
north
and
his
brother
came
riding
rapidly
along
side
by
side
over
the
open
prairie
they
had
approached
within
fifty
or
sixty
yards
of
a
narrow
ravine
of
the
existence
of
which
they
were
ignorant
when
an
indian
raised
his
head
above
its
side
and
fired
the
ball
whistled
between
the
heads
of
the
two
riders
major
north
threw
up
his
hands
and
reeled
in
the
saddle
as
if
about
to
fall
and
the
indian
head
disappeared
from
sight
springing
from
his
horse
the
major
handed
his
bridle
rein
to
his
brother
and
directed
him
to
ride
away
at
a
gallop
the
tramp
of
the
two
horses
sounded
more
and
more
faintly
on
the
hard
ground
and
the
indian
thinking
that
the
whites
were
riding
off
raised
his
head
to
note
the
effect
of
his
shot
north
rifle
was
already
leveled
at
the
spot
where
the
head
had
disappeared
and
as
the
black
hair
came
into
view
the
finger
pressed
the
trigger
more
and
more
closely
and
as
the
eyes
appeared
above
the
ground
a
ball
pierced
the
brain
of
tall
bull
a
hundred
yards
up
the
ravine
was
found
his
war
pony
stabbed
to
the
heart
and
by
it
sat
his
squaw
awaiting
with
indian
patience
whatever
fate
might
come
to
her
during
one
of
the
summer
hunts
on
which
major
north
accompanied
the
pawnees
they
were
one
day
scattered
out
over
the
prairie
running
buffalo
when
all
at
once
north
heard
the
whistle
of
rifle
balls
and
saw
the
dirt
thrown
up
about
his
horse
by
the
bullets
he
called
to
a
pawnee
near
him
to
tell
those
boys
to
be
more
careful
about
shooting
the
pawnee
looked
in
the
direction
from
which
the
balls
were
coming
and
after
an
instant
called
back
they
are
sioux
you
had
better
run
it
was
a
large
party
of
sioux
under
the
chief
turkey
leg
north
and
the
pawnee
rode
for
the
bluffs
near
at
hand
and
before
reaching
them
were
joined
by
morse
his
and
half
a
dozen
pawnees
the
little
party
was
surrounded
by
the
sioux
and
took
refuge
in
a
shallow
washout
at
the
head
of
a
ravine
where
they
were
somewhat
sheltered
from
the
enemy
fire
by
the
sunflower
stalks
and
the
low
edges
of
the
bank
their
horses
were
at
once
killed
and
the
sioux
who
were
numerous
became
very
bold
charging
up
to
the
edge
of
the
washout
and
shooting
down
into
it
they
were
led
by
an
indian
apparently
of
some
importance
who
was
conspicuous
by
a
large
american
flag
which
he
carried
this
man
was
constantly
exhorting
his
men
and
would
lead
them
part
way
on
the
charge
turning
off
however
before
coming
within
range
of
the
washout
where
north
and
his
with
the
seven
pawnees
were
lying
concealed
after
each
charge
he
would
ride
to
the
top
of
a
hill
near
at
hand
and
make
a
speech
to
his
warriors
it
occurred
to
major
north
that
if
he
could
kill
the
man
who
carried
the
flag
the
other
sioux
might
lose
some
of
their
courage
as
they
were
retiring
from
a
charge
therefore
he
crept
cautiously
down
the
ravine
concealed
by
the
long
grass
which
grew
in
its
bed
until
he
had
come
within
rifle
range
of
the
hill
from
which
the
leader
was
making
his
speech
and
by
a
careful
shot
killed
him
and
regained
the
shelter
of
the
washout
without
injury
disheartened
by
the
fall
of
their
leader
the
sioux
made
no
further
attempt
to
kill
the
besieged
company
but
after
a
little
desultory
firing
drew
off
so
that
north
and
his
little
party
regained
the
main
village
in
safety
the
pawnee
scouts
were
last
called
out
in
when
general
mackenzie
fought
the
hostile
cheyennes
in
the
powder
river
country
and
led
by
major
north
and
his
brother
they
made
that
famous
charge
on
the
village
which
inflicted
on
the
hostiles
the
crushing
blow
from
which
they
never
recovered
how
held
his
men
under
fire
that
day
when
the
bullets
were
raining
on
them
from
the
hillsides
was
told
in
a
letter
written
to
me
by
a
participant
in
the
fight
for
cool
bravery
it
ran
he
beats
anything
that
you
ever
saw
why
at
one
time
we
were
under
such
hot
fire
that
even
our
scouts
wanted
to
run
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
felt
sort
of
that
way
myself
but
frank
just
straightened
himself
up
on
the
old
black
horse
and
said
very
quietly
first
one
of
men
that
runs
i
will
kill
they
did
run
if
the
full
story
of
major
north
life
were
written
it
would
constitute
a
history
of
the
indian
wars
in
nebraska
and
wyoming
from
to
a
history
so
complete
that
there
would
be
little
left
to
add
to
it
wherever
the
hostile
indians
were
worst
there
frank
north
was
to
be
found
at
the
head
of
his
pawnee
scouts
doing
the
hardest
of
the
fighting
and
accomplishing
work
that
could
have
been
done
by
no
other
body
of
men
from
his
long
service
in
the
army
major
north
was
known
to
all
officers
who
have
ever
been
stationed
in
the
field
where
his
operations
were
conducted
and
by
all
of
them
he
was
admired
and
respected
he
was
closely
connected
with
the
growth
of
the
state
of
nebraska
several
times
he
represented
platte
county
in
the
legislature
and
the
strength
and
uprightness
of
his
character
won
the
confidence
of
all
who
knew
him
he
died
at
his
home
in
columbus
nebraska
march
aged
years
his
was
a
singularly
lovable
nature
if
the
stronger
manly
points
of
his
character
inspired
respect
and
admiration
not
less
did
his
gentleness
and
consideration
for
others
win
the
deepest
affection
he
was
modest
almost
to
diffidence
and
it
was
with
difficulty
that
he
could
be
induced
to
speak
of
his
own
heroic
achievements
and
yet
his
face
told
the
story
of
the
power
within
the
man
the
secret
of
major
north
success
in
commanding
the
pawnees
who
loved
him
as
much
as
they
respected
him
lay
in
the
unvarying
firmness
justice
patience
and
kindness
with
which
he
treated
them
he
never
demanded
anything
unreasonable
of
them
but
when
he
gave
an
order
even
though
obedience
involved
great
peril
or
appeared
to
mean
certain
death
it
was
a
command
that
must
be
carried
out
he
was
their
commander
but
at
the
same
time
their
brother
and
friend
above
all
he
was
their
leader
in
going
into
battle
he
never
said
to
them
go
but
always
come
on
it
is
little
wonder
then
that
the
devotion
felt
for
him
by
all
the
pawnee
nation
and
especially
by
the
men
who
had
served
under
him
in
battle
was
as
steadfast
as
it
was
touching
iii
war
parties
it
has
already
been
said
that
the
highest
ambition
of
the
pawnee
young
man
was
to
be
successful
in
war
his
whole
training
all
his
surroundings
caused
him
to
believe
that
this
success
was
the
only
thing
worth
living
for
life
at
best
he
regarded
as
hard
enough
and
only
the
fame
to
be
acquired
by
the
performance
of
brave
deeds
could
sweeten
it
so
as
to
make
it
endurable
to
convey
a
notion
of
the
way
in
which
these
war
parties
were
originated
and
of
the
manner
in
which
they
were
led
i
give
here
stories
told
me
by
three
brave
men
who
in
the
old
days
led
out
many
war
parties
the
three
stories
were
taken
down
from
the
lips
of
the
narrators
only
one
who
is
familiar
with
scenes
in
an
indian
camp
can
conceive
how
much
these
stories
lose
by
being
put
into
cold
type
as
heard
from
the
lips
of
the
indian
they
have
accessories
of
surroundings
voice
and
gesticulation
which
add
tremendously
to
their
vividness
and
their
interest
your
indian
is
a
real
actor
and
in
telling
a
story
he
throws
himself
into
his
tale
and
helps
out
his
vocal
speech
with
a
sign
vocabulary
which
almost
tells
the
whole
story
to
one
who
is
ignorant
of
the
language
in
the
middle
of
the
lodge
the
fire
is
burning
and
over
it
hangs
the
pot
which
is
ever
bubbling
at
the
back
of
the
lodge
opposite
the
doorway
sits
the
host
and
above
him
to
the
lodge
poles
are
tied
the
sacred
bundles
their
buckskin
coverings
black
with
the
smoke
and
wear
of
years
perhaps
of
centuries
to
the
left
of
the
host
are
the
most
important
guests
and
the
other
inmates
of
the
lodge
are
scattered
about
here
and
there
the
women
being
nearest
the
door
the
host
hands
the
pipe
to
some
young
man
who
carefully
fills
it
and
soon
it
is
passing
around
the
circle
then
a
few
remarks
are
made
by
the
older
men
and
some
question
is
asked
which
starts
discussion
after
that
comes
a
pause
and
then
a
warrior
begins
a
story
he
is
and
he
tells
how
he
took
the
horses
they
tell
me
that
my
father
was
a
warrior
and
in
his
time
led
out
many
war
parties
in
my
young
days
i
went
out
with
war
parties
as
a
volunteer
many
times
in
my
trips
with
warriors
i
had
closely
watched
their
ways
and
movements
i
had
learned
from
them
how
to
shoot
and
how
to
travel
so
as
to
escape
discovery
i
made
three
trips
as
leader
i
resolved
one
time
just
as
we
were
setting
out
on
the
summer
hunt
that
during
the
hunt
i
would
lead
a
party
off
on
the
warpath
i
made
my
plans
but
i
waited
first
to
make
the
sacrifice
at
that
time
we
did
not
go
far
we
came
back
to
the
village
because
the
sioux
were
about
us
on
the
hunt
on
a
certain
day
i
played
all
day
the
stick
game
in
the
afternoon
i
had
lost
everything
i
had
late
in
the
afternoon
i
called
a
few
of
the
young
men
to
sit
down
with
me
when
they
had
come
and
sat
down
with
me
there
were
only
a
few
i
said
to
them
have
called
you
together
to
let
you
know
that
i
am
poor
in
mind
i
want
to
find
out
if
will
take
pity
on
me
and
help
me
i
intend
that
you
and
i
shall
go
off
somewhere
on
the
warpath
make
your
preparations
to
start
in
two
days
get
your
moccasins
filled
with
food
get
your
awls
and
sinews
your
arrows
and
your
bows
on
the
day
i
had
set
in
the
night
we
went
out
from
the
village
having
with
us
the
old
man
who
had
performed
the
ceremonies
of
the
sacred
things
that
i
was
to
have
with
me
on
the
outskirts
of
the
village
we
stood
in
a
row
and
the
old
man
prayed
for
our
success
then
we
were
ready
to
start
different
war
parties
had
gone
out
before
i
started
but
i
considered
to
see
if
there
was
not
some
way
in
which
i
could
beat
them
i
made
a
plan
by
which
i
got
ahead
of
them
we
traveled
fast
and
went
up
to
grand
island
to
get
some
arrows
for
my
young
men
had
but
few
arrows
and
also
to
get
some
provisions
the
next
morning
we
again
started
and
went
as
far
as
we
could
that
day
at
night
i
performed
ceremonies
as
i
had
been
directed
i
filled
a
pipe
and
smoked
to
as
we
have
always
done
that
is
the
first
thing
we
have
to
do
then
i
told
some
of
my
young
men
to
build
a
fire
and
others
to
go
off
to
a
distance
to
watch
on
a
war
party
some
one
was
always
taken
along
who
could
shoot
well
this
time
we
had
no
one
except
myself
the
next
day
i
killed
an
antelope
but
i
did
not
sacrifice
then
because
those
are
not
animals
which
we
sacrifice
we
had
been
gone
three
nights
more
before
i
killed
anything
more
the
fourth
day
i
killed
a
buck
deer
and
i
sacrificed
it
from
that
day
on
i
never
killed
anything
after
i
had
been
out
nine
days
i
stole
the
horses
it
was
not
always
the
same
about
stealing
horses
it
was
not
always
done
in
the
same
way
it
was
daytime
when
my
scouts
discovered
that
there
were
people
about
they
saw
signs
of
a
village
they
told
me
afterward
that
they
had
heard
reports
of
guns
during
the
day
they
had
not
come
back
to
tell
me
of
this
but
had
gone
by
i
was
coming
on
behind
with
the
young
men
when
all
at
once
i
heard
the
report
of
a
gun
as
soon
as
i
heard
it
i
stopped
and
sent
two
spies
out
to
see
what
it
was
and
whether
a
camp
was
near
they
wandered
about
in
the
timber
and
came
back
and
said
that
they
saw
nothing
i
told
my
men
that
we
would
go
off
to
a
distance
and
wait
there
during
the
night
we
waited
there
until
morning
and
when
the
sun
got
up
we
heard
the
report
of
guns
in
different
directions
and
sometimes
coming
toward
us
we
went
to
a
cañon
and
hid
in
the
plum
brush
and
ate
plums
of
course
we
were
afraid
but
we
ate
the
plums
we
thought
that
this
might
be
the
last
time
we
would
ever
have
any
plums
they
were
shooting
all
about
us
and
seemed
to
be
coming
closer
in
the
afternoon
the
shots
stopped
and
they
went
on
to
their
camp
while
we
were
hiding
here
many
of
the
party
feared
that
we
had
been
seen
they
wanted
to
start
back
as
soon
as
it
grew
dark
but
i
deceived
them
i
told
them
that
i
was
very
thirsty
and
that
we
would
have
to
go
down
to
a
certain
place
near
the
river
and
get
a
drink
of
water
after
night
we
started
and
as
we
were
going
along
we
heard
a
dog
bark
we
stopped
and
sat
down
and
i
told
my
companions
that
two
men
whom
i
called
by
name
were
to
go
and
steal
horses
i
said
am
going
with
them
to
look
after
them
i
told
them
to
pull
off
their
leggings
and
moccasins
because
the
brush
was
dry
and
caught
on
them
making
a
noise
we
went
together
to
a
certain
place
near
the
village
and
then
these
young
men
told
me
that
they
had
been
there
the
day
before
and
had
been
discovered
then
they
turned
around
and
went
back
to
where
the
party
were
hiding
but
i
went
on
to
the
village
when
i
came
close
to
the
village
everything
was
still
the
people
were
asleep
where
i
entered
the
camp
there
was
a
little
timber
growing
and
here
i
stopped
while
i
was
considering
what
i
should
do
a
girl
came
out
of
a
lodge
but
she
went
away
from
me
if
she
had
come
toward
me
i
should
have
killed
her
for
she
would
have
discovered
me
after
the
girl
had
entered
a
lodge
i
went
into
the
camp
to
where
there
were
some
horses
i
drove
them
out
of
the
camp
six
went
back
and
i
drove
nine
to
where
i
had
left
my
party
the
two
that
i
had
ordered
to
steal
horses
for
me
were
there
when
i
came
to
the
place
and
found
all
my
men
there
i
said
to
them
is
very
good
i
have
stolen
some
horses
for
you
now
i
will
go
back
and
get
the
rest
of
them
for
you
one
of
the
other
men
persuaded
me
not
to
go
again
but
to
let
him
go
he
did
so
and
brought
the
six
other
horses
it
was
the
custom
if
it
was
very
difficult
or
dangerous
to
go
to
a
place
to
steal
horses
for
the
leader
himself
to
go
and
do
the
work
after
two
nights
on
the
return
journey
i
divided
the
horses
among
the
men
it
used
to
be
the
custom
after
a
party
had
been
successful
and
brought
back
the
horses
for
them
to
change
their
names
after
this
trip
my
name
was
changed
to
it
was
the
custom
among
the
pawnees
if
they
brought
in
horses
to
make
an
offering
we
felt
that
we
owed
something
to
and
we
gave
a
horse
to
the
priest
the
old
man
who
had
performed
the
ceremonies
i
was
gone
but
thirteen
days
and
returned
to
my
tribe
after
him
follows
he
too
tells
his
story
and
explains
why
one
of
his
war
parties
was
unsuccessful
my
father
told
me
if
i
should
ever
want
to
go
off
on
a
war
party
to
humble
myself
and
not
to
let
a
day
pass
without
praying
to
by
my
smokes
i
must
always
remember
to
pray
to
to
give
me
a
strong
will
and
to
encourage
and
bless
me
in
my
worship
to
him
even
when
i
was
eating
i
must
always
remember
to
pray
to
him
this
i
must
do
for
some
time
before
starting
out
at
one
time
i
felt
that
i
was
poor
and
i
resolved
to
go
off
on
the
warpath
a
warrior
whom
i
knew
went
out
and
took
a
lot
of
horses
he
had
been
as
poor
as
i
believed
that
this
man
had
got
his
horses
because
he
had
prayed
to
and
i
thought
i
pray
to
why
may
i
not
do
the
same
so
i
prayed
no
one
else
knew
what
i
intended
after
i
had
made
up
my
mind
i
selected
another
man
one
whom
i
could
trust
and
called
him
to
tell
him
of
my
resolve
i
made
him
sit
by
me
in
the
lodge
and
said
to
him
want
you
to
sit
by
me
and
smoke
and
learn
my
intention
after
we
had
smoked
i
said
to
him
friend
i
want
you
to
know
that
we
are
on
the
warpath
we
are
going
out
to
look
for
some
horses
after
he
had
smoked
the
other
man
replied
saying
it
is
well
let
us
ask
to
take
pity
on
us
to
help
us
on
our
war
trip
and
to
let
us
bring
home
many
horses
we
two
were
the
leaders
some
time
after
we
had
talked
together
and
made
up
our
minds
what
we
would
do
we
selected
certain
young
men
that
we
could
depend
on
and
told
them
that
we
were
on
the
warpath
this
was
done
in
this
way
we
selected
a
pipe
with
which
to
have
a
sacred
smoke
filled
it
and
smoked
then
we
called
together
into
the
lodge
the
others
who
did
not
know
our
purpose
after
they
had
assembled
i
filled
the
pipe
and
said
are
going
on
a
war
party
we
have
filled
this
pipe
and
must
decide
what
is
to
be
done
then
i
passed
the
pipe
to
the
man
who
sat
next
to
me
if
he
wished
to
join
us
he
smoked
and
passed
it
to
the
next
man
it
was
not
allowed
for
any
one
to
smoke
unless
he
would
go
with
this
party
some
might
refuse
the
pipe
saying
have
decided
to
go
with
another
party
the
smoking
of
the
pipe
was
a
promise
that
the
leader
could
depend
on
the
man
who
smoked
they
used
to
have
a
certain
ceremony
to
follow
before
starting
out
on
the
warpath
it
was
something
handed
down
a
special
manner
of
praying
to
that
he
would
bless
them
in
their
warfare
at
last
everything
was
ready
for
the
start
the
young
men
had
their
packs
made
up
they
carried
cooked
pounded
corn
and
pounded
buffalo
meat
mixed
with
tallow
and
sometimes
the
loads
were
heavy
some
would
carry
ten
pairs
of
moccasins
each
one
stuffed
full
of
corn
or
pounded
buffalo
meat
they
were
well
fed
the
loads
were
so
heavy
that
at
first
we
would
only
make
short
marches
the
leaders
had
to
see
that
the
young
men
were
not
overworked
when
all
was
ready
the
priest
who
performed
the
ceremonies
met
us
he
brought
with
him
the
sacred
bundle
which
we
were
to
take
with
us
at
night
when
it
was
all
still
after
every
one
was
asleep
the
ceremonies
were
performed
we
smoked
and
worshiped
to
the
east
and
west
and
to
the
north
and
south
and
prayed
for
success
on
that
night
we
started
and
went
as
far
as
we
could
and
the
next
day
toward
evening
when
we
stopped
we
dug
out
a
like
the
one
in
a
lodge
and
we
two
leaders
sat
by
it
facing
the
east
while
before
us
were
the
sacred
things
the
leader
has
to
be
a
good
orator
he
has
to
speak
to
his
young
men
and
advise
them
well
encouraging
them
to
be
he
would
speak
to
them
and
say
have
but
a
short
time
to
live
so
while
we
are
on
this
trip
let
us
determine
to
be
let
us
all
look
to
who
is
the
ruler
over
all
things
and
ask
him
to
take
pity
on
us
and
bless
our
warpath
we
must
respect
the
animals
that
the
ruler
has
made
and
not
kill
any
of
them
no
birds
nor
wolves
nor
any
creeping
things
not
a
night
passed
but
that
after
we
were
seated
in
a
circle
i
would
talk
to
the
party
and
pray
and
hope
that
would
bless
us
and
take
pity
on
us
and
that
we
might
be
the
party
that
would
have
good
success
on
my
war
parties
i
had
to
watch
at
all
times
even
when
i
was
resting
to
see
that
my
young
men
should
before
they
slept
pray
to
that
they
might
dream
something
good
and
that
it
might
come
to
pass
the
old
priest
who
had
performed
the
ceremonies
and
had
let
me
take
the
sacred
things
had
told
me
to
kill
a
particular
kind
of
animal
a
deer
and
sacrifice
it
i
sent
some
spies
ahead
to
look
over
the
country
and
a
messenger
came
back
from
them
saying
that
they
had
seen
some
animals
he
did
not
describe
them
and
i
ordered
the
messenger
to
have
the
hunter
kill
them
i
heard
the
report
of
a
gun
the
hunter
with
two
shots
killed
three
they
were
antelope
when
the
hunter
came
to
me
he
told
me
what
he
had
done
and
described
the
animals
which
he
had
killed
they
were
not
the
animals
i
had
been
directed
to
kill
for
the
sacrifice
i
hesitated
for
i
did
not
know
what
to
do
i
did
not
wish
to
eat
these
animals
before
the
sacrifice
had
been
made
to
do
this
is
bad
it
troubled
me
i
was
troubled
because
if
we
ate
them
it
would
look
as
if
we
cared
nothing
for
finally
we
ate
what
had
been
killed
and
made
no
sacrifice
afterward
we
killed
two
more
and
ate
them
and
still
made
no
sacrifice
one
night
i
dreamed
that
the
hunter
had
shot
a
buffalo
it
fell
but
as
we
went
up
to
it
it
got
up
and
ran
off
we
went
on
for
eight
days
and
had
made
no
sacrifice
to
one
day
my
scouts
saw
a
man
sitting
on
a
hill
some
of
them
wanted
to
shoot
at
him
but
the
others
said
they
came
back
to
tell
me
about
it
and
when
they
had
returned
to
the
place
where
they
had
seen
him
the
man
was
gone
the
man
had
seen
my
spies
not
far
off
was
a
village
and
the
warriors
in
it
came
to
look
for
us
but
we
ran
away
they
hunted
for
us
but
we
had
got
out
of
their
sight
after
this
we
came
back
home
curly
chief
second
chief
of
the
band
is
the
last
and
he
tells
how
he
sacrificed
a
scalp
it
was
in
the
fall
before
the
winter
buffalo
hunt
was
made
that
i
thought
i
would
go
on
the
warpath
every
little
while
i
would
call
a
few
men
to
sit
down
with
me
and
would
tell
them
that
i
had
it
in
mind
to
go
on
the
warpath
the
people
went
out
on
the
winter
hunt
and
killed
buffalo
and
while
they
were
on
their
way
back
to
the
village
i
started
on
the
warpath
with
a
number
of
young
men
from
the
camp
we
went
south
to
the
arkansas
river
when
we
reached
that
river
it
began
to
snow
and
the
snow
fell
six
feet
deep
we
stopped
in
one
place
eleven
days
till
the
snow
got
less
deep
from
there
we
went
on
to
the
sandhills
by
the
north
canadian
one
day
as
we
were
going
along
we
saw
far
off
three
indians
on
foot
they
were
kiowas
probably
they
had
been
on
the
warpath
and
had
lost
their
horses
we
attacked
and
killed
them
they
did
not
fight
we
killed
them
like
women
then
indeed
we
divided
the
scalps
and
made
many
of
them
from
there
we
started
home
and
found
the
tribe
camped
on
the
solomon
river
when
we
reached
home
there
was
great
joy
and
we
danced
the
scalp
dance

chief
i
sacrificed
a
scalp
to
i
felt
that
he
had
given
me
the
victory
over
my
enemies
and
for
this
reason
i
wanted
to
give
him
something
i
wanted
to
make
an
acknowledgment
of
his
goodness
to
me
he
had
taken
pity
on
me
and
helped
me
it
was
a
sacrifice
greater
than
the
sacrifice
of
the
buffalo
meat
not
many
men
have
made
it
but
once
in
a
while
you
see
some
one
who
has
been
noticed
by
the
ruler
it
is
our
aim
after
we
have
been
helped
to
give

the
doctor
and
had
nothing
in
common
with
it
the
priest
was
in
a
sense
the
medium
of
communication
with
he
prayed
to
the
deity
more
efficaciously
than
could
a
common
person
acted
in
fact
as
an
intercessor
he
knew
the
secrets
of
the
sacred
bundles
and
when
he
asked
anything
good
for
the
tribe
or
for
an
individual
it
was
likely
to
be
granted
his
education
and
the
power
given
him
from
above
brought
him
into
specially
close
relations
with
who
seemed
to
watch
over
him
and
to
listen
to
him
when
he
interceded
for
the
tribe
he
was
an
intermediary
between
and
the
people
and
held
a
relation
to
the
pawnees
and
their
deity
not
unlike
that
occupied
by
moses
to
jehovah
and
the
israelites
the
office
of
the
medicine
man
shaman
or
doctor
had
to
do
only
with
sickness
or
injury
he
was
the
healer
disease
was
caused
by
bad
spirits
and
it
was
the
doctor
part
to
drive
off
these
evil
influences
in
the
lodge
or
house
of
every
pawnee
of
influence
hanging
on
the
west
side
and
so
opposite
the
door
is
the
sacred
bundle
neatly
wrapped
in
buckskin
and
black
with
smoke
and
age
what
these
bundles
contain
we
do
not
know
sometimes
from
the
ends
protrude
bits
of
scalps
and
the
tips
of
pipe
stems
and
slender
sticks
but
the
whole
contents
of
the
bundle
are
known
only
to
the
priests
and
to
its
owner
perhaps
not
always
even
to
him
the
sacred
bundles
are
kept
on
the
west
side
of
the
lodge
because
being
thus
furthest
from
the
door
fewer
people
will
pass
by
them
than
if
they
were
hung
in
any
other
part
of
the
lodge
various
superstitions
attach
to
these
bundles
in
the
lodges
where
certain
of
them
are
kept
it
is
forbidden
to
put
a
knife
in
the
fire
in
others
a
knife
may
not
be
thrown
in
others
it
is
not
permitted
to
enter
the
lodge
with
the
face
painted
or
again
a
man
can
not
go
in
if
he
has
feathers
tied
in
his
head
on
certain
sacred
occasions
the
bundles
are
opened
and
their
contents
form
part
of
the
ceremonial
of
worship
no
one
knows
whence
the
bundles
came
many
of
them
are
very
old
too
old
even
to
have
a
history
their
origin
is
lost
in
the
haze
of
the
long
ago
they
say
the
sacred
bundles
were
given
us
long
ago
no
one
knows
when
they
came
to
us
secret
pipe
chief
one
of
the
very
oldest
men
in
the
tribe
and
its
high
priest
said
to
me
all
the
sacred
bundles
are
from
the
far
off
country
in
the
southwest
from
which
we
came
long
ago
they
were
handed
down
to
the
people
before
they
started
on
their
journey
then
they
had
never
seen
anything
like
iron
but
they
had
discovered
how
to
make
the
flint
knives
and
arrow
points
there
was
nothing
that
came
to
us
through
the
whites
it
all
came
to
us
through
the
power
of
through
his
power
we
were
taught
how
to
make
bows
and
stone
knives
and
arrow
heads
it
was
through
the
ruler
of
the
universe
that
the
sacred
bundles
were
given
to
us
we
look
to
them
because
through
them
and
the
buffalo
and
the
corn
we
worship
we
all
even
the
chiefs
respect
the
sacred
bundles
when
a
man
goes
on
the
warpath
and
has
led
many
scouts
and
brought
the
scalps
he
has
done
it
through
the
sacred
bundles
there
were
many
different
ceremonies
that
they
used
to
go
through
the
high
priest
performs
these
ceremonies
the
high
priestship
was
founded
in
this
way
the
black
eagle
spoke
to
a
person
and
said
to
him
am
one
of
those
nearest
to
and
you
must
look
to
me
to
be
helped
to
the
birds
and
the
animals
look
to
me
the
black
eagle
to
the
eagle
to
the
otter
and
the
buffalo
the
black
eagle
sent
the
buzzard
as
a
messenger
to
this
person
and
he
gave
him
the
corn
the
secrets
of
the
high
priestship
and
the
other
secrets
were
handed
down
at
the
same
time
the
buzzard
because
he
is
bald
stands
for
the
old
men
who
have
little
hair
the
eagle
also
represents
the
old
men
those
whose
hair
is
white
these
are
the
messengers
through
whom
sends
his
words
to
the
people
the
wichitas
also
had
these
secrets
and
so
have
the
rees
the
pawnees
believe
that
they
were
created
by
but
that
there
had
been
people
on
the
earth
before
them
they
say
the
first
men
who
lived
on
the
earth
were
very
large
indians
they
were
giants
very
big
and
very
strong
the
animals
that
lived
then
were
the
same
that
we
know
now
and
of
the
same
size
these
giants
used
to
hunt
the
buffalo
on
foot
they
were
so
swift
and
strong
that
a
man
could
run
down
a
buffalo
and
kill
it
with
a
great
stone
or
a
club
or
even
with
his
flint
knife
then
when
he
had
killed
it
if
it
was
a
big
buffalo
bull
he
would
tie
it
up
throw
it
over
his
back
and
carry
it
into
camp
just
as
a
man
would
carry
in
an
antelope
when
one
killed
a
yearling
he
would
push
its
head
up
under
his
belt
and
let
its
body
swing
by
his
side
just
as
we
would
carry
a
rabbit
these
people
did
not
believe
in
when
it
would
thunder
and
rain
they
would
shake
their
fists
at
the
sky
and
call
out
bad
words
in
these
days
all
people
wherever
they
live
all
indians
all
white
men
all
mexicans
and
all
black
men
when
they
smoke
up
speak
to
and
ask
that
he
will
give
them
the
right
kind
of
a
mind
and
that
he
will
bless
them
so
that
they
may
have
plenty
to
eat
and
may
be
successful
in
war
and
may
be
made
chiefs
and
head
men
when
we
smoke
toward
the
earth
we
say
of
the
dead
you
see
us
this
means
that
this
is
ground
it
belongs
to
him
and
we
ask
him
that
he
will
let
us
walk
on
it
and
will
let
us
be
buried
in
it
we
believe
that
after
we
are
dead
we
will
live
again
with
up
in
the
sky
we
fear
nothing
after
death
worse
than
we
know
now
all
will
live
again
with
and
be
happy
a
thief
one
who
steals
from
others
in
the
camp
one
who
is
bad
dies
and
that
is
the
end
of
him
he
goes
into
the
ground
and
does
not
live
again
one
reason
why
we
believe
that
there
is
a
life
after
death
is
that
sometimes
when
asleep
we
dream
and
see
these
things
we
see
ourselves
living
with
then
too
we
often
dream
of
our
people
whom
we
have
known
and
who
have
died
we
dream
of
being
dead
ourselves
and
of
meeting
these
people
and
talking
with
them
and
going
to
war
with
them
now
these
giants
did
not
believe
in
any
of
these
things
they
did
not
pray
to
and
they
thought
that
they
were
very
strong
and
that
nothing
could
overcome
them
they
grew
worse
and
worse
at
last
got
angry
and
he
made
the
water
rise
up
level
with
the
land
and
all
the
ground
became
soft
and
these
great
people
sank
down
into
the
mud
and
were
drowned
the
great
bones
found
on
the
prairie
are
the
bones
of
these
people
and
we
have
been
in
deep
cañons
and
have
seen
big
bones
under
ground
which
convinces
us
that
these
people
did
sink
into
the
soft
ground
after
the
destruction
of
the
race
of
giants
created
a
new
race
of
men
small
like
those
of
he
made
first
a
man
and
a
woman
they
lived
on
the
earth
and
were
good
to
them
was
given
the
corn
from
this
man
and
this
woman
the
pawnees
sprung
and
they
have
always
cultivated
the
corn
from
the
earliest
times
there
can
be
no
doubt
as
to
the
belief
of
the
pawnees
in
a
future
life
the
spirits
of
the
dead
live
after
their
bodies
have
become
dust
the
stories
of
the
ghost
bride
and
the
ghost
wife
already
given
are
examples
of
this
belief
secret
pipe
chief
told
me
of
himself
i
was
dead
once
just
as
i
died
i
found
my
way
leading
to
an
indian
village
i
entered
it
and
went
straight
to
the
lodge
of
my
friends
and
my
relations
i
saw
them
and
when
i
saw
them
i
knew
them
again
i
even
knew
my
old
relations
whom
i
had
never
looked
on
when
i
was
alive
i
went
into
a
lodge
but
i
was
not
offered
a
seat
and
i
thought
that
i
was
not
welcome
i
came
out
of
the
lodge
and
went
out
of
the
village
toward
the
west
then
i
came
back
to
life
again
in
the
morning
i
had
died
and
i
came
to
life
in
the
afternoon
that
must
be
the
reason
that
i
still
live
and
am
getting
old
i
was
not
welcome
yet
they
did
not
receive
me
from
this
i
am
convinced
that
there
is
a
life
after
we
are
dead
sometimes
ghosts
appear
to
them
but
more
often
they
merely
speak
to
them
only
a
voice
is
heard
they
believe
that
the
little
whirlwinds
often
seen
in
summer
are
ghosts
the
reason
for
this
is
that
once
a
person
shot
at
a
whirlwind
with
his
arrow
the
arrow
passed
through
it
and
it
all
disappeared
and
came
to
nothing
then
the
man
was
convinced
that
it
was
a
ghost
and
that
he
had
killed
it
the
different
bands
of
the
pawnees
had
not
all
the
same
beliefs
thus
the
skidi
band
offered
up
the
human
sacrifice
a
captive
taken
in
war
to
the
morning
star
this
is
thought
to
have
been
a
propitiatory
offering
to
avert
the
evil
influences
exerted
by
that
planet
at
the
present
day
the
indians
speak
of
the
sacrifice
as
having
been
made
to
none
of
the
other
tribes
had
this
form
of
worship
and
in
this
fact
we
have
another
indication
that
the
separation
of
the
skidi
from
the
pawnees
had
been
a
long
one
the
band
of
the
are
said
to
have
been
the
only
ones
of
the
pawnees
who
did
not
worship
they
worshiped
toward
the
west
mention
has
been
made
of
the
or
animals
which
possess
miraculous
attributes
given
them
by
the
pawnees
know
of
five
places
where
these
animals
meet
to
hold
council
five
of
these
lodges
one
of
these
is
at
on
the
south
side
of
the
platte
river
opposite
the
town
of
fremont
in
nebraska
the
word
means
hill
island
another
animal
home
is
under
an
island
in
the
platte
river
near
the
town
of
central
city
it
is
called
by
the
pawnees
meaning
dark
island
the
third
of
these
sacred
places
is
on
the
loup
fork
opposite
the
mouth
of
the
cedar
river
and
under
a
high
white
cut
bank
it
is
called
white
bank
another
is
on
the
solomon
river
water
on
a
bank
it
is
called
sometimes
this
is
a
mound
shaped
like
a
dirt
lodge
at
the
top
of
the
mound
in
the
middle
is
a
round
hole
in
which
down
below
can
be
seen
water
at
certain
times
the
people
gather
there
and
throw
into
this
hole
their
offerings
to
blankets
and
robes
blue
beads
tobacco
eagle
feathers
and
moccasins
sometimes
when
they
are
gathered
there
the
water
rises
to
the
top
of
the
hole
and
flows
out
running
down
the
side
of
the
mound
into
the
river
then
the
mothers
take
their
little
children
and
sprinkle
the
water
over
them
and
pray
to
to
bless
them
the
water
running
out
of
the
hole
often
carries
with
it
the
offerings
and
the
ground
is
covered
with
the
old
rotten
things
that
have
been
thrown
in
the
fifth
place
is
a
hard
smooth
flinty
rock
sticking
up
out
of
the
ground
they
call
it
hill
that
points
the
way
in
the
side
of
the
hill
there
is
a
great
hole
where
the
hold
councils
this
hill
is
in
kansas
and
can
be
seen
from
the
burlington
missouri
river
railroad
it
is
known
to
the
whites
as
guide
rock
ii
ceremonies
to
describe
satisfactorily
any
considerable
proportion
of
the
religious
ceremonials
of
the
pawnees
would
require
a
more
extended
space
than
is
here
at
my
command
several
of
the
special
ceremonies
however
may
be
mentioned
in
general
terms
like
some
other
tribes
of
the
plains
indians
the
pawnees
had
a
certain
special
worship
at
the
time
of
the
first
thunder
in
the
spring
this
first
thunder
warned
them
that
winter
was
at
an
end
and
that
the
time
of
the
planting
was
drawing
near
of
this
worship
a
said
to
me
we
all
believe
in
we
know
that
there
is
a
power
above
that
moves
the
universe
and
that
he
controls
all
things
in
the
old
days
when
they
had
buffalo
meat
they
used
to
make
a
sacrifice
at
the
time
of
the
first
thunder
in
the
spring
the
next
day
after
it
had
thundered
all
the
people
would
go
into
the
sacred
lodge
where
the
sacred
bundles
were
kept
at
that
time
when
they
had
all
come
together
the
priest
would
open
the
bundles
and
take
out
the
sacred
things
among
which
were
indian
tobacco
and
some
little
pieces
of
scalp
tied
to
a
stick
through
these
sacred
things
we
worshiped
and
the
sacrifices
were
made
to
the
ruler
above
this
seemed
to
be
a
help
to
us
and
we
used
to
live
increase
and
grow
strong
up
north
when
we
worshiped
at
the
time
of
the
first
thunder
we
never
had
cyclones
down
here
now
that
this
worship
has
been
given
up
we
have
them
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
most
important
of
the
religious
ceremonials
of
the
pawnees
were
the
burnt
offering
of
the
animal
and
of
the
scalp
these
two
though
different
had
yet
the
same
meaning
in
each
the
sacrifice
was
an
offering
to
perhaps
next
in
importance
to
these
were
the
buffalo
dance
and
the
corn
dance
which
were
special
ceremonies
to
implore
a
blessing
on
the
hunt
and
on
the
harvest
the
first
animal
killed
on
the
hunt
was
sacrificed
it
was
necessary
that
this
animal
should
be
either
a
deer
or
a
buffalo
the
first
one
killed
on
the
hunt
of
these
two
kinds
they
were
not
permitted
to
kill
any
other
sort
of
an
animal
save
only
these
two
until
after
the
sacrifice
had
been
made
when
this
first
animal
had
been
killed
it
was
brought
into
the
camp
and
taken
to
the
sacred
lodge
and
there
the
priests
themselves
went
through
the
secret
ceremonies
then
they
divided
the
meat
and
took
a
part
of
it
to
the
southeast
end
of
the
village
there
they
built
a
fire
of
sticks
and
placed
the
meat
on
it
as
the
fire
burned
the
flesh
the
whole
tribe
marched
slowly
and
reverently
by
the
fire
and
grasped
handfuls
of
the
smoke
and
rubbed
it
over
their
bodies
and
arms
and
prayed
saying
now
you
the
ruler
look
at
your
children
and
bless
them
keep
them
and
have
mercy
upon
them
and
care
for
them
if
any
could
not
understand
such
as
little
children
their
elders
who
did
understand
their
relations
prayed
for
them
the
sick
were
carried
out
to
the
place
and
prayed
and
the
smoke
was
rubbed
over
them
the
young
men
would
run
races
starting
from
a
certain
place
and
going
around
the
village
until
they
came
to
the
place
where
the
smoke
of
the
sacrifice
rose
the
sacrifice
by
burning
of
the
scalp
was
a
very
elaborate
performance
and
occupied
a
whole
day
the
high
priest
faced
the
east
and
prayed
and
sang
twelve
times
descriptions
of
it
given
me
in
general
terms
indicate
that
this
ceremony
was
extremely
interesting
it
was
rather
unusual
but
was
performed
once
in
the
sacrifice
of
the
captive
has
not
been
practiced
by
the
skidi
for
a
long
time
perhaps
forty
or
fifty
years
bear
chief
told
me
that
he
had
witnessed
it
six
times
eagle
chief
who
is
perhaps
between
fifty
and
sixty
years
old
says
he
has
seen
it
once
the
old
skidi
described
the
ceremony
as
follows
the
skidi
alone
of
the
pawnees
sacrificed
human
beings
to
when
they
had
returned
home
from
war
successful
bringing
captives
with
them
they
selected
one
of
these
for
the
sacrifice
the
others
were
adopted
into
the
tribe
but
this
one
who
must
be
young
and
stout
one
who
would
fatten
easily
was
kept
apart
eating
by
himself
fed
on
the
best
of
food
and
treated
with
the
greatest
kindness
no
hint
of
the
fate
in
store
for
him
was
given
until
the
day
of
the
sacrifice
for
four
nights
before
that
day
the
people
danced
and
for
four
days
they
feasted
each
day
after
they
had
got
through
feasting
the
dishes
were
taken
to
their
especial
place
each
woman
after
she
got
through
eating
rose
and
said
to
the
prisoner
have
finished
eating
and
i
hope
that
i
may
be
blessed
from
that
he
may
take
pity
on
me
that
when
i
put
my
seed
in
the
ground
they
may
grow
and
that
i
may
have
plenty
of
everything
at
the
end
of
the
four
days
two
old
men
went
one
to
each
end
of
the
village
and
called
aloud
directing
every
male
person
in
the
village
to
make
a
bow
and
an
arrow
and
to
be
ready
for
the
sacrifice
for
every
male
child
that
had
been
born
a
bow
and
an
arrow
was
made
for
the
little
boys
small
bows
that
they
could
bend
and
small
arrows
the
arrows
must
be
feathered
with
the
feathers
of
the
eagle
or
of
some
bird
of
prey
a
hawk
an
owl
or
an
eagle
they
must
not
cut
the
feathers
nor
burn
them
to
make
them
low
the
next
day
before
daybreak
every
one
was
ready
all
of
the
warriors
who
had
led
parties
on
the
warpath
took
from
their
sacred
bundles
their
collars
made
from
the
feathers
of
the
bird
they
wore
and
put
them
on
their
backs
and
tied
them
about
their
necks
they
held
their
pipes
in
their
left
hands
to
signify
that
they
were
warriors
every
male
carried
his
bow
and
arrow
every
woman
had
a
lance
or
a
stick
just
before
daylight
they
all
went
out
to
the
west
end
of
the
village
and
stood
there
looking
for
the
prisoner
to
be
brought
here
two
stout
posts
had
been
set
up
one
of
ash
and
the
other
of
hackberry
and
between
these
had
been
tied
four
the
three
lower
ones
to
aid
in
climbing
up
to
the
highest
of
the
four
the
purple
martin
as
day
broke
the
people
looking
back
toward
the
village
could
see
the
captive
being
led
toward
them
bound
hand
and
foot
behind
him
as
he
was
led
along
followed
a
warrior
carrying
the
heart
and
tongue
of
a
buffalo
after
him
came
another
carrying
a
blazing
stick
then
one
with
a
bow
and
arrow
and
last
a
warrior
with
the
stuffed
skin
of
an
owl
they
led
the
naked
captive
to
the
posts
and
lifting
him
up
tied
first
the
left
hand
and
then
the
right
to
the
top
and
afterward
tied
the
feet
below
every
one
stood
there
silent
looking
waiting
the
men
holding
their
weapons
and
the
women
their
sticks
and
lances
on
the
ground
under
the
sacrifice
was
laid
the
wood
for
a
great
fire
which
was
now
lighted
then
the
man
with
the
blazing
stick
stepped
forward
but
before
he
reached
the
captive
the
warrior
with
the
bow
and
arrow
he
who
had
taken
the
captive
ran
up
close
to
the
victim
and
shot
him
through
from
side
to
side
beneath
the
arms
with
the
sacred
arrow
whose
point
was
of
flint
such
as
they
used
in
the
olden
time
after
the
blood
had
run
down
upon
the
fire
below
the
warrior
who
carried
the
buffalo
tongue
and
the
heart
placed
them
on
the
fire
beneath
the
body
when
this
had
been
done
the
man
who
carried
the
owl
ran
up
and
seized
the
burning
stick
and
burned
the
body
once
under
each
arm
and
once
in
each
groin
in
all
four
times
then
at
a
given
signal
the
males
all
ran
up
and
shot
their
arrows
into
the
body
if
any
male
children
were
not
large
enough
to
shoot
some
one
shot
for
them
there
were
so
many
arrows
that
the
body
was
stuck
full
of
them
it
bristled
with
them
a
man
chosen
for
this
purpose
now
climbed
up
and
pulled
out
all
the
arrows
from
the
body
except
the
one
which
was
first
shot
through
the
side
of
the
sacrifice
and
placed
them
together
in
a
pile
on
the
ground
where
they
were
left
after
pulling
out
the
arrows
this
man
took
his
knife
and
cut
open
the
breast
of
the
captive
and
putting
his
hand
in
the
opening
took
out
a
handful
of
blood
and
smeared
it
over
his
face
and
then
jumped
to
the
ground
and
ran
away
as
fast
as
he
could
each
of
the
four
men
after
he
had
done
his
part
ran
away
very
fast
and
went
down
to
the
river
and
washed
himself
when
this
had
been
done
the
women
came
with
their
sticks
and
spears
and
struck
the
body
and
counted
on
it
even
the
little
children
struck
it
after
they
had
done
this
they
put
their
sticks
together
on
the
ground
in
a
pile
and
left
them
there
by
this
time
the
fire
was
burning
up
high
and
scorching
the
body
and
it
was
kept
up
until
the
whole
body
was
consumed
and
while
the
smoke
of
the
blood
and
the
buffalo
meat
and
of
the
burning
body
ascended
to
the
sky
all
the
people
prayed
to
and
walked
by
the
fire
and
grasped
handfuls
of
the
smoke
and
passed
it
over
their
bodies
and
over
those
of
their
children
and
prayed
to
take
pity
on
them
and
to
give
them
health
and
success
in
war
and
plenteous
crops
the
man
who
had
killed
the
captive
fasted
and
mourned
for
four
days
and
asked
to
take
pity
on
him
for
he
knew
that
he
had
taken
the
life
of
a
human
being
this
sacrifice
always
seemed
acceptable
to
and
when
the
skidi
made
it
they
always
seemed
to
have
good
fortune
in
war
and
good
crops
and
they
were
always
well
after
the
sacrifice
was
over
then
came
the
old
women
to
rejoice
over
what
had
been
done
they
would
act
as
the
warriors
used
to
do
when
coming
back
from
a
war
party
they
carried
the
mother
corn
they
went
to
the
body
and
counted
on
it
and
then
went
back
to
the
village
some
of
them
would
take
the
large
hollow
stalks
of
the
sunflower
and
put
dust
in
them
and
then
blow
it
out
pretending
to
shoot
the
puff
of
dust
standing
for
the
smoke
of
a
shot
they
would
go
up
to
the
secret
lodge
and
standing
outside
of
it
would
tell
the
story
of
how
they
came
to
go
on
their
pretended
war
party
and
what
they
did
while
they
were
gone
and
what
enemies
they
struck
the
whole
long
story
the
people
meanwhile
would
stand
about
and
laugh
at
them
as
they
did
these
things
imitating
the
warriors
the
old
women
changed
their
names
also
one
of
the
leading
old
women
once
took
the
name
on
the
meat
another
skin
tobacco
pouch
another
fish
old
man
another
man
stepping
on
the
heart
the
old
men
standing
about
would
joke
with
the
old
women
and
these
would
joke
and
make
fun
of
each
other
the
different
acts
of
this
sacrifice
appear
to
have
been
typical
of
the
deeds
and
necessities
of
warfare
thus
the
feathers
of
the
eagle
used
on
the
arrows
shot
into
the
captive
represented
success
in
war
their
use
was
a
prayer
to
that
as
these
birds
were
fierce
and
successful
when
making
an
attack
so
those
who
shot
might
be
fierce
in
war
and
always
conquerors
the
burning
of
the
body
of
the
captive
with
the
blazing
stick
perhaps
typified
the
lighting
of
the
sacred
pipe
which
could
only
be
done
by
one
who
had
sacrificed
a
scalp
the
shooting
arrows
into
the
body
by
the
males
and
the
striking
it
by
the
women
typified
the
killing
of
and
counting
on
the
enemy
the
cutting
open
the
belly
was
the
first
act
in
the
sacrifice
of
the
animal
the
burnt
offering
it
will
be
noted
that
this
account
differs
in
many
particulars
from
that
given
by
dunbar
in
his
papers
on
this
people
but
i
think
it
worth
recording
as
being
an
independent
relation
by
a
very
old
man
who
i
have
no
doubt
has
been
an
of
more
than
one
of
these
remarkable
sacrifices
i
know
of
no
satisfactory
and
detailed
account
of
any
of
the
sacred
dances
of
the
pawnees
there
were
many
of
these
among
them
the
corn
dance
the
buffalo
dance
the
wild
horse
dance
the
deer
bear
dog
dances
and
so
on
i
give
below
an
account
of
the
corn
dance
as
detailed
to
me
by
curly
chief
who
said
the
windy
month
march
was
the
one
in
which
gave
us
the
seed
to
cultivate
the
first
moon
of
april
is
the
one
during
which
they
had
a
special
worship
about
the
corn
until
these
ceremonies
had
been
performed
no
one
would
clear
out
the
patch
where
they
intended
to
plant
the
crop
everybody
waited
for
this
time
the
was
the
only
tribe
in
which
this
special
ceremony
was
handed
down
the
and
worshiped
with
them
the
preparations
for
this
dance
are
always
made
by
a
woman
she
has
to
think
about
it
a
long
time
before
she
can
make
up
her
mind
to
undertake
it
in
making
ready
for
the
dance
she
must
furnish
the
dried
meat
made
from
the
whole
of
a
buffalo
fat
and
lean
every
part
of
it
the
sack
which
holds
the
heart
she
dries
and
fills
it
with
all
the
kinds
of
corn
the
five
colors
the
blue
corn
which
represents
the
blue
sky
the
red
corn
which
stands
for
the
evening
sunset
the
yellow
corn
which
typifies
the
morning
sunrise
the
white
corn
which
stands
for
a
white
cloud
and
the
spotted
corn
which
represents
the
sky
dotted
with
clouds
all
these
she
puts
in
the
bag
placing
in
the
sack
three
grains
of
each
at
a
time
on
the
special
day
which
has
been
fixed
for
the
dance
she
must
offer
these
things
to
the
people
are
all
gathered
together
the
women
standing
on
the
outside
of
the
circle
behind
and
the
men
on
the
inner
side
of
the
circle
in
front
this
is
a
woman
dance
and
yet
the
men
are
there
in
front
of
the
women
these
men
are
the
leading
warriors
of
the
tribe
they
have
been
off
on
the
warpath
and
in
time
of
corn
have
gone
to
the
enemy
they
have
been
successful
in
war
and
therefore
they
are
with
the
women
they
stand
about
the
circle
holding
their
pipes
in
their
left
hands
showing
that
they
are
leaders
of
war
parties
and
each
with
the
skin
of
a
particular
bird
tied
on
top
of
the
head
showing
that
they
are
warriors
a
martin
the
floor
of
the
lodge
must
be
hard
and
swept
as
clean
as
it
can
be
on
the
left
hand
side
as
you
look
toward
the
door
is
a
buffalo
skull
when
the
day
has
come
all
the
people
are
gathered
together
and
are
standing
about
the
lodge
the
high
priest
stands
at
the
back
of
the
lodge
with
the
sacred
bundles
of
the
three
bands
before
him
then
this
leading
woman
comes
forward
and
presents
to
the
high
priest
the
dried
meat
and
the
sack
of
corn
and
two
ancient
sacred
hoes
made
from
the
of
a
buffalo
bound
to
a
handle
by
the
neck
ligament
she
places
them
on
the
ground
before
the
sacred
bundles
the
corn
in
the
middle
and
the
two
hoes
on
either
side
with
these
things
she
also
presents
a
sacred
pipe
filled
and
ready
for
lighting
taken
from
a
sacred
bundle
then
she
steps
back
the
old
high
priest
must
well
know
the
ceremonies
to
be
performed
he
prays
to
and
lights
the
sacred
pipe
blowing
smoke
to
heaven
to
the
earth
and
to
the
four
points
of
the
compass
while
the
ceremonies
are
going
on
the
buffalo
skull
is
taken
to
the
sacred
place
in
this
lodge
and
put
in
a
particular
position
then
the
leading
woman
steps
forward
again
followed
by
two
others
she
takes
the
bag
of
corn
and
the
other
two
women
take
the
hoes
and
they
stand
in
front
of
the
high
priest
he
sings
and
prays
the
leading
woman
stands
in
a
particular
position
as
directed
by
the
high
priest
holding
the
bag
of
corn
up
to
the
sky
in
both
her
hands
and
as
he
sings
she
raises
and
lowers
it
in
time
to
the
music
of
the
song
after
these
ceremonies
the
women
come
forward
holding
their
hoes
in
their
hands
and
dance
about
the
lodge
one
after
another
in
single
file
following
the
leading
woman
four
times
they
dance
about
the
lodge
she
can
not
pass
the
priest
the
fifth
time
these
ceremonies
and
the
songs
and
prayers
were
to
ask
for
a
blessing
on
the
hunt
and
on
the
corn
and
to
learn
whether
they
would
be
blessed
in
both
after
the
women
had
danced
and
gone
back
to
their
places
everybody
looked
on
the
floor
of
the
lodge
to
see
whether
there
were
any
buffalo
hairs
there
if
they
saw
them
they
all
said
we
are
going
to
be
successful
in
our
hunt
and
in
our
corn
everybody
said
are
blessed
then
when
they
would
go
out
on
the
hunt
they
would
find
plenty
of
buffalo
and
the
messenger
sent
back
to
the
village
from
the
hunt
would
return
to
the
camp
and
say
have
plenty
of
corn
if
they
saw
a
great
many
buffalo
hairs
they
would
get
many
buffalo
if
but
few
they
would
get
some
buffalo
the
next
day
after
these
ceremonies
every
one
would
begin
to
clear
up
their
patches
and
get
ready
to
plant
corn
the
leading
woman
who
prepared
the
dance
is
respected
and
highly
thought
of
after
that
she
is
like
a
chief
this
ceremony
is
the
next
principal
thing
we
have
after
the
burnt
offering
of
the
animal
and
of
the
scalp
we
did
not
invent
this
it
came
to
us
from
the
ruler
and
we
worship
him
through
it
he
gave
us
the
corn
and
blessed
us
through
it
by
it
we
are
made
strong
we
are
like
seed
and
we
worship
through
the
corn
iii
medicine
and
mystery
it
has
been
said
that
the
medicine
men
or
doctors
among
the
pawnees
occupied
a
position
by
themselves
their
guild
was
entirely
distinct
from
that
of
the
priests
a
priest
might
be
a
doctor
as
well
but
not
because
he
was
a
priest
the
doctors
were
primarily
healers
their
function
was
to
fight
disease
like
many
other
savage
nations
the
pawnees
believed
that
sickness
was
caused
by
evil
spirits
which
had
entered
into
the
patient
and
must
be
driven
out
if
he
was
to
recover
in
their
treatment
of
injuries
the
doctors
were
often
singularly
successful
major
north
has
cited
for
me
a
number
of
instances
in
which
men
whose
hurts
had
refused
to
yield
to
the
treatment
of
the
united
states
army
surgeons
had
been
cured
by
pawnee
doctors
some
of
these
have
been
detailed
elsewhere
as
might
be
imagined
however
the
pawnee
treatment
of
disease
was
less
efficacious
simple
ailments
were
often
treated
with
success
by
means
of
the
familiar
sudatory
or
sweat
house
but
in
the
case
of
more
serious
complaints
the
dancing
and
rattling
which
constitute
so
large
a
part
of
the
doctor
treatment
tend
to
aggravate
rather
than
to
check
the
disease
i
have
not
space
to
discuss
the
very
interesting
subject
of
the
system
of
therapeutics
practiced
by
the
pawnee
doctors
dunbar
has
gone
into
this
matter
quite
fully
and
the
reader
is
referred
to
his
papers
for
an
account
of
their
practice
as
the
doctors
had
to
fight
evil
spirits
it
is
not
surprising
that
they
should
have
summoned
magic
to
their
aid
but
this
magic
probably
served
its
more
important
purpose
in
impressing
the
other
indians
with
a
belief
in
the
doctors
powers
some
of
the
performances
which
took
place
at
the
doctors
dances
were
very
marvellous
and
most
of
them
were
quite
inexplicable
to
those
who
saw
what
was
done
that
they
should
have
imposed
on
the
indian
spectator
is
perhaps
not
surprising
but
it
is
further
to
be
noted
that
intelligent
white
men
whose
powers
of
observation
have
been
highly
trained
have
confessed
themselves
wholly
unable
to
explain
these
startling
performances
or
to
hazard
a
guess
as
to
the
means
by
which
they
were
accomplished
that
these
things
happened
as
detailed
is
well
authenticated
by
the
testimony
of
many
perfectly
credible
witnesses
other
masters
of
mystery
are
provided
with
mechanical
aids
of
one
kind
or
another
some
apparatus
which
assists
them
in
imposing
on
their
audiences
by
concealing
certain
objects
or
certain
acts
by
means
of
which
they
cause
things
to
appear
different
from
what
they
really
are
the
pawnee
doctors
had
nothing
of
this
their
dances
were
conducted
by
naked
men
in
a
ring
surrounded
by
spectators
the
floor
of
bare
earth
packed
hard
and
worn
smooth
by
the
tread
of
many
feet
afforded
no
apparent
opportunity
for
concealment
or
trickery
under
such
conditions
were
performed
their
mysteries
a
few
of
which
i
will
mention
as
they
appeared
to
watchful
spectators
distant
not
more
than
or
thirty
feet
and
often
much
nearer
the
simplest
performances
were
the
swallowing
of
spears
and
arrows
these
feats
were
merely
mechanical
and
were
no
doubt
really
as
they
appeared
the
arrows
and
the
spears
being
driven
down
the
gullet
to
the
distance
of
a
foot
or
eighteen
inches
instances
occurred
where
men
who
had
swallowed
arrows
died
from
the
injuries
received
in
the
operation
bear
chief
himself
a
doctor
and
tattooed
with
a
bear
on
the
right
side
told
me
that
it
was
much
harder
and
more
painful
to
swallow
an
arrow
than
a
spear
among
the
more
remarkable
performances
witnessed
and
vouched
for
by
my
friend
captain
north
are
the
following
several
men
representing
elk
came
into
the
ring
and
trotted
about
so
as
to
be
seen
by
every
one
imitating
the
movements
of
those
animals
to
their
heads
were
tied
branches
to
represent
horns
and
each
wore
an
elk
skin
thrown
over
his
back
a
doctor
came
into
the
ring
and
handed
to
the
spectators
his
arrows
which
they
examined
and
found
to
be
ordinary
arrows
with
the
usual
points
on
receiving
back
the
arrows
from
those
who
had
examined
them
the
doctor
pretended
to
hunt
the
elk
and
at
length
shot
at
them
striking
them
in
the
sides
or
on
the
legs
the
arrows
instead
of
penetrating
the
flesh
bounded
back
some
of
them
flying
fifteen
or
twenty
feet
in
the
air
they
appeared
to
be
shot
with
the
full
force
of
the
bow
and
when
picked
up
and
handed
to
the
onlookers
the
points
were
found
to
be
doubled
back
as
if
they
had
been
shot
against
a
plate
of
iron
and
the
shafts
of
some
of
them
were
split
the
elk
trotted
away
and
out
of
the
ring
without
injury
a
man
representing
an
enemy
came
into
the
ring
on
foot
a
doctor
followed
armed
with
a
hatchet
which
he
passed
to
the
spectators
for
examination
it
was
an
ordinary
hatchet
of
the
tomahawk
form
on
receiving
back
the
hatchet
the
doctor
started
in
pursuit
of
the
enemy
who
fled
the
doctor
overtook
him
and
with
a
vigorous
blow
sunk
the
hatchet
up
to
the
handle
in
the
enemy
skull
leaving
it
there
the
wounded
man
staggered
on
passing
within
five
or
six
feet
of
the
ring
of
spectators
who
plainly
saw
the
blood
from
the
wound
running
down
the
man
face
and
dripping
from
his
hair
behind
they
saw
also
the
gray
oozing
from
the
wound
the
wounded
man
was
taken
from
the
ring
into
the
doctor
lodge
a
few
days
later
he
was
seen
about
and
in
his
usual
health
a
small
boy
six
or
eight
years
of
age
was
led
into
the
ring
quite
naked
he
was
placed
upon
the
ground
and
two
men
sat
upon
him
one
on
his
chest
the
other
on
his
legs
with
a
knife
an
incision
was
made
in
his
belly
one
of
the
doctors
inserted
his
fingers
and
after
feeling
about
pulled
out
of
the
cut
what
looked
like
a
portion
of
the
liver
this
he
cut
off
and
gave
to
the
other
man
who
ate
it
the
remainder
of
the
liver
was
crowded
back
into
the
hole
and
the
boy
was
carried
off
subsequently
he
was
seen
about
apparently
in
good
health
a
man
representing
a
bear
came
into
the
ring
and
was
pursued
by
a
number
of
indians
who
shot
arrows
at
him
for
some
time
without
appearing
to
injure
him
at
length
however
an
arrow
pierced
him
through
the
bowels
and
the
wound
was
plainly
seen
on
each
side
the
man
fell
and
appeared
to
be
dying
he
was
removed
to
the
lodge
and
in
a
short
time
was
entirely
recovered
major
north
saw
one
of
these
bear
performances
in
which
the
pretended
bear
having
attacked
one
of
his
pursuers
the
latter
slashed
him
across
the
abdomen
with
a
large
knife
inflicting
a
cut
from
which
the
bowels
hung
down
so
that
they
dragged
on
the
ground
the
bear
was
carried
off
and
in
a
short
time
was
healed
and
went
about
as
usual
major
north
told
me
that
he
saw
with
his
own
eyes
the
doctors
make
the
corn
grow
this
was
in
the
medicine
lodge
in
the
middle
of
the
lodge
the
doctor
dug
up
a
piece
of
the
hard
trodden
floor
of
the
lodge
about
as
large
as
a
dinner
plate
and
broke
up
between
his
fingers
the
hard
pieces
of
soil
until
the
dirt
was
soft
and
friable
the
ground
having
thus
been
prepared
and
having
been
moistened
with
water
a
few
kernels
of
corn
were
buried
in
the
loose
earth
then
the
doctor
retired
a
little
from
the
spot
and
sang
and
as
the
place
where
the
corn
was
buried
was
watched
the
soil
was
seen
to
move
and
a
tiny
green
blade
came
slowly
into
view
this
continued
to
increase
in
height
and
size
until
in
the
course
of
twenty
minutes
or
half
an
hour
from
the
time
of
planting
the
stalk
of
corn
was
a
foot
or
fifteen
inches
in
height
at
this
point
major
north
was
obliged
to
leave
the
lodge
to
take
out
a
white
woman
who
was
fainting
from
the
heat
and
so
did
not
see
the
maturing
of
the
corn
all
the
indians
and
white
men
who
remained
assured
him
that
the
stalks
continued
to
grow
until
they
were
of
full
height
and
that
they
then
tasseled
out
and
put
forth
one
or
more
ears
of
corn
which
grew
to
full
size
and
that
then
the
doctor
approached
the
plant
plucked
an
ear
and
passed
it
to
the
spectators
similar
to
this
was
a
feat
performed
with
a
cedar
berry
the
berry
was
passed
around
among
the
spectators
for
examination
and
was
then
planted
as
the
corn
had
been
then
after
a
few
moments
the
doctor
approached
the
spot
put
his
thumb
and
forefinger
down
into
the
soft
dirt
and
seemed
to
lay
hold
of
something
very
slowly
he
raised
his
hand
and
was
seen
to
hold
on
the
tips
of
his
fingers
the
end
of
a
cedar
twig
slowly
his
hand
was
moved
from
the
ground
the
twig
growing
longer
and
longer
when
nine
or
ten
inches
high
it
began
to
have
side
branches
the
doctor
still
holding
the
topmost
twig
of
what
was
by
this
time
a
cedar
bush
continued
to
lift
his
hand
very
slowly
until
it
was
about
three
feet
from
the
ground
and
then
let
go
of
the
bush
then
presently
he
took
hold
of
the
stem
close
to
the
ground
and
seeming
to
exert
a
good
deal
of
force
pulled
up
the
bush
by
the
roots
and
all
the
people
saw
the
bush
and
its
bunch
of
fresh
and
growing
roots
enough
has
been
said
of
these
mystery
ceremonies
to
indicate
that
they
were
very
remarkable
the
circumstances
under
which
they
were
performed
would
seem
to
remove
them
from
the
more
commonplace
tricks
of
professional
jugglers
and
i
have
never
found
any
one
who
could
even
suggest
an
explanation
of
them
as
might
be
inferred
these
mysterious
doings
greatly
impressed
the
pawnees
and
the
older
men
among
them
have
a
vast
store
of
reminiscences
of
past
dances
which
they
delight
in
repeating
in
the
course
of
a
long
talk
with
bear
chief
one
evening
he
recounted
a
number
of
instances
which
he
had
seen
he
said
a
man
in
our
tribe
was
blind
he
could
not
see
he
could
travel
in
the
night
as
well
as
we
can
in
the
day
but
when
daylight
came
he
could
see
nothing
at
one
time
he
called
together
his
relations
and
told
them
that
though
blind
he
wished
to
lead
out
a
war
party
he
said
know
that
i
with
my
party
will
kill
an
enemy
they
started
out
a
young
man
leading
him
by
the
hand
all
day
long
after
they
had
been
out
several
days
he
told
the
young
men
to
be
ready
that
the
next
morning
he
was
going
to
kill
an
enemy
the
next
morning
while
they
were
traveling
along
they
saw
an
enemy
and
surrounded
and
killed
him
they
took
the
scalp
and
brought
it
home
and
he
had
great
credit
because
being
blind
he
had
killed
an
enemy
they
were
all
surprised
that
a
blind
man
should
have
killed
an
enemy
he
sacrificed
the
scalp
to
and
was
made
a
warrior
and
went
to
the
sacred
lodge
and
told
the
story
of
his
campaign
and
was
made
a
warrior
a
blind
warrior
it
was
a
wonderful
thing
for
a
blind
person
to
be
able
to
travel
in
the
night
this
must
have
come
from
one
of
the
wonderful
things
done
by
this
man
was
at
a
medicine
dance
everybody
was
there
he
stood
up
with
his
bearskin
over
him
and
was
led
out
before
the
people
a
cedar
branch
was
given
him
and
he
sharpened
the
end
where
it
had
been
cut
off
and
stuck
it
in
the
ground
everybody
was
now
asked
to
pull
up
this
branch
and
many
tried
to
do
so
but
the
strongest
men
in
the
tribe
could
not
move
it
he
could
pull
it
up
as
if
it
were
stuck
in
the
mud
he
thrust
the
pointed
end
in
the
ground
again
and
asked
the
doctors
to
pull
up
the
cedar
branch
they
tried
to
do
so
but
could
not
stir
it
the
chiefs
also
were
asked
to
try
to
do
this
they
tried
but
could
not
move
it
something
seemed
to
hold
it
in
the
ground
after
everybody
had
tried
to
pull
it
up
and
failed
this
blind
man
went
to
it
and
taking
hold
of
it
pulled
with
all
his
strength
and
pulled
up
with
it
about
six
feet
of
roots
there
lay
the
tree
with
all
it
roots
fresh
and
growing
there
was
in
my
young
days
a
certain
brave
man
in
the
tribe
his
name
was
elk
left
behind
he
was
so
brave
that
when
the
sioux
surrounded
him
he
would
kill
so
many
that
he
would
scare
the
rest
away
in
one
of
the
doctors
dances
he
had
the
skin
of
a
fawn
in
his
hands
he
called
out
to
the
people
you
people
watch
me
look
close
and
see
what
i
shall
do
and
you
will
find
out
what
my
bravery
is
and
that
it
all
comes
from
this
that
you
see
in
our
presence
he
shook
this
fawn
skin
and
the
fawn
slipped
out
of
his
hands
and
then
stood
before
him
a
living
fawn
looking
at
him
is
what
i
mean
said
he
the
enemies
surround
me
that
is
the
way
i
come
out
of
it
the
fawn
can
run
so
fast
that
it
can
never
be
caught
nor
can
it
ever
be
shot
this
man
was
wonderful
he
used
to
imitate
the
deer
and
the
elk
he
could
never
be
driven
into
timber
or
brush
or
where
there
were
thickets
he
said
i
am
ever
wounded
it
will
be
when
i
go
into
timber
or
brush
he
always
wanted
to
be
in
the
open
plain
where
he
could
be
surrounded
he
never
ran
to
the
timber
for
shelter
if
they
suspected
that
the
sioux
were
coming
to
attack
the
village
he
would
load
a
gun
and
shoot
it
off
if
the
ball
came
back
to
him
there
were
no
sioux
coming
if
it
did
not
then
they
would
be
coming
when
i
was
present
it
always
came
back
to
him
there
were
no
sioux
coming
at
one
time
in
the
doctors
dance
i
saw
him
driving
ten
young
men
who
pretended
that
they
were
deer
he
had
a
gun
and
loaded
it
and
shot
the
ten
men
one
after
another
through
the
side
they
fell
down
wounded
and
then
got
up
and
limped
off
half
dying
he
drove
them
around
the
ring
so
that
the
people
might
see
their
wounds
after
they
had
looked
at
them
he
went
up
to
the
first
and
slapped
him
on
the
back
and
the
ball
dropped
out
of
him
on
to
the
ground
and
the
man
straightened
up
healed
so
he
did
to
all
up
to
the
tenth
man
and
they
were
all
healed
this
was
wonderful
illustration
sun
chief
at
one
time
he
wanted
to
show
the
people
that
he
could
stand
anything
he
and
two
others
were
attacked
by
sioux
he
said
want
to
be
wounded
let
us
go
to
the
thickets
they
did
so
and
a
sioux
shot
him
through
the
back
and
the
other
two
were
wounded
but
he
healed
them
all
after
they
had
got
away
from
the
sioux
another
man
in
the
doctors
dance
had
four
young
men
pretend
that
they
were
horses
all
had
manes
and
tails
and
were
painted
to
imitate
horses
he
had
a
gun
to
which
was
tied
a
scalp
he
loaded
the
gun
and
while
he
was
doing
this
the
horses
ran
off
and
stood
looking
back
at
the
man
he
cocked
the
gun
and
laid
it
on
the
ground
pointing
toward
the
horses
and
placed
the
scalp
near
the
trigger
and
walked
some
steps
away
then
he
motioned
to
the
scalp
and
the
gun
went
off
and
one
of
the
horses
went
down
wounded
it
seems
that
the
ghost
of
the
scalp
obeyed
his
motion
and
shot
off
the
gun
he
loaded
the
gun
again
and
placed
it
on
the
ground
as
before
the
second
time
he
went
way
off
and
as
soon
as
he
waved
his
hand
and
said
the
gun
went
off
and
another
horse
went
down
this
was
repeated
until
all
the
horses
were
down
the
people
examined
them
and
saw
that
they
were
really
wounded
in
the
breast
the
man
went
up
to
them
and
they
seemed
to
be
dying
and
vomited
blood
and
the
young
man
slapped
them
and
the
balls
came
out
of
their
mouths
and
as
soon
as
the
balls
came
away
from
them
they
were
healed
there
were
two
people
a
brother
and
sister
children
of
a
man
who
had
been
helped
by
a
bear
one
time
when
we
were
having
a
dance
the
sister
and
brother
came
forward
each
carrying
five
cedar
branches
about
three
feet
long
they
rolled
a
big
rock
into
the
middle
of
the
lodge
so
that
all
might
see
what
they
were
going
to
do
then
they
called
ten
private
men
who
were
not
doctors
and
told
them
to
thrust
the
ends
of
the
branches
into
the
stone
as
if
they
had
grown
there
and
they
sang
the
trees
growing
in
the
rock
the
cedar
tree
grows
in
the
rock
these
cedar
branches
were
cut
square
off
at
the
butt
and
were
set
on
the
stone
they
were
not
big
enough
to
be
even
and
balance
but
still
they
stood
upright
as
if
grown
from
the
rock
the
doctors
tried
to
blow
them
down
with
their
fans
made
of
eagle
feathers
but
they
could
not
do
it
you
could
not
blow
them
off
nor
pull
them
off
at
length
the
men
who
put
them
there
were
told
to
take
them
off
they
had
hard
work
to
do
it
but
at
last
they
succeeded
the
sister
i
saw
her
do
it
put
her
hands
up
to
the
sun
and
then
putting
them
on
the
ground
and
scratching
and
throwing
up
dust
she
would
take
up
her
hands
and
have
hands
like
a
bear
with
hair
and
long
claws
she
used
to
understand
how
to
make
plums
and
other
fruits
grow
on
trees
she
supplied
the
doctors
with
choke
cherries
and
plums
the
doctors
had
trees
brought
in
that
had
no
fruit
on
them
she
would
make
the
plums
grow
and
shaking
the
tree
they
would
fall
down
and
everybody
would
have
a
taste
of
them
this
was
at
a
doctors
dance
illustration
a
parfleche
later
history
i
removal
to
the
indian
territory
the
project
of
removing
the
pawnees
from
their
reservation
on
the
loup
river
in
nebraska
appears
to
have
been
first
heard
of
in
the
year
the
pawnee
reservation
was
close
to
civilization
and
the
settlers
moving
west
into
nebraska
coveted
the
indians
lands
it
was
the
old
story
the
same
one
that
has
been
heard
ever
since
the
rapacious
whites
first
set
foot
on
the
shores
of
this
continent
the
pawnees
were
strongly
attached
to
their
home
in
nebraska
they
had
always
lived
there
and
were
used
to
it
their
forefathers
were
buried
there
up
to
the
winter
of
they
had
no
idea
of
moving
but
they
were
constantly
being
subjected
to
annoyances
settlers
crowded
in
close
to
the
pawnee
agency
and
even
located
on
it
on
the
south
and
east
and
in
the
most
matter
of
fact
way
drove
their
teams
into
the
pawnee
timber
and
cut
and
carried
off
the
pawnee
wood
on
which
the
tribe
depended
for
fuel
and
for
building
materials
this
open
robbery
gave
rise
to
constant
disputes
and
bickerings
between
the
indians
and
the
whites
in
which
the
former
were
invariably
worsted
on
the
south
and
east
side
of
the
reservation
the
crowding
and
the
depredations
were
continuous
on
the
north
and
west
the
reservation
was
exposed
to
frequent
incursions
from
the
different
bands
of
sioux
war
parties
came
down
from
their
reservations
stole
the
pawnees
horses
killed
their
women
while
at
work
in
the
fields
and
sometimes
even
attacked
the
village
these
attacks
though
always
successfully
repelled
by
the
pawnees
were
a
continual
source
of
annoyance
and
irritation
to
them
while
their
consistent
desire
to
obey
the
rules
laid
down
for
their
guidance
by
the
government
prevented
them
from
retaliating
in
kind
upon
their
enemies
the
first
proposition
to
remove
the
pawnees
to
the
indian
territory
originated
with
the
whites
but
there
is
some
reason
to
think
that
an
independent
movement
with
the
same
object
in
view
was
made
by
members
of
the
pawnee
tribe
as
nearly
as
i
can
learn
from
conversation
with
indians
who
took
a
leading
part
in
the
movement
this
project
for
a
removal
of
a
part
of
the
tribe
to
the
south
originated
with
lone
chief
the
and
was
taken
up
and
supported
by
left
hand
known
also
as
spotted
horse
a
turbulent
spirit
who
was
killed
a
few
years
ago
by
an
united
states
marshal
and
by
frank
white
an
intelligent
soldier
of
the
band
in
the
summer
of
lone
chief
led
a
visiting
party
which
is
said
to
have
numbered
three
hundred
men
south
to
the
wichitas
when
this
party
turned
back
to
go
north
in
the
fall
many
of
them
were
sick
with
chills
and
fever
a
disease
unknown
to
them
until
that
time
and
some
died
on
the
way
at
this
time
the
notion
of
the
removal
had
not
been
suggested
but
it
is
probable
that
even
then
lone
chief
was
considering
the
advisability
of
moving
south
with
his
own
immediate
family
and
taking
up
his
residence
with
the
wichitas
he
had
not
yet
spoken
of
this
project
however
but
in
the
winter
of
he
announced
his
intention
of
doing
this
and
even
started
on
his
journey
but
for
some
reason
turned
back
the
next
winter
while
the
tribe
was
absent
on
the
buffalo
hunt
the
northern
sioux
came
down
and
stole
from
the
pawnees
a
number
of
horses
this
made
the
pawnees
uneasy
and
some
war
parties
started
out
it
was
at
this
time
that
lone
chief
conceived
the
idea
of
increasing
the
company
which
should
proceed
south
with
him
after
some
consideration
and
consultation
lone
chief
spotted
horse
and
frank
white
planned
that
a
small
party
should
go
south
and
visit
the
different
tribes
in
the
indian
territory
for
the
purpose
of
learning
how
these
tribes
would
regard
a
general
movement
of
the
pawnees
down
into
their
country
the
plan
was
not
fully
developed
until
this
small
party
of
which
spotted
horse
and
frank
white
were
the
leaders
was
on
its
way
the
party
visited
first
the
otoes
and
kaws
and
then
going
south
came
to
the
wichitas
comanches
kiowas
and
apaches
and
were
everywhere
hospitably
entertained
and
given
presents
of
horses
they
asked
the
chiefs
and
headmen
of
the
various
tribes
which
they
visited
to
come
together
at
a
certain
specified
time
at
the
wichita
camp
telling
them
that
they
had
something
that
they
wished
to
say
to
them
there
the
pawnees
then
returned
to
the
wichita
village
and
awaited
the
appointed
time
soon
the
representatives
of
the
different
tribes
began
to
arrive
day
after
day
they
kept
coming
in
until
all
were
present
when
they
had
assembled
in
council
spotted
horse
rose
to
speak
he
said
my
brothers
i
want
you
to
know
one
thing
we
the
pawnees
want
to
be
brothers
and
to
be
at
peace
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
come
down
here
with
my
party
of
pawnees
to
live
with
you
the
chiefs
representing
the
different
tribes
all
expressed
their
satisfaction
at
this
announcement
and
urged
him
to
come
as
he
had
intended
they
said
we
have
good
land
here
and
lots
of
buffalo
we
shall
be
glad
if
you
decide
to
come
after
all
had
spoken
spotted
horse
again
stood
up
and
said
brothers
there
is
here
with
me
one
leading
man
among
the
pawnees
he
also
will
tell
you
what
he
thinks
about
this
frank
white
then
spoke
and
said
that
he
intended
to
accompany
spotted
horse
when
he
should
move
south
the
chiefs
of
the
different
tribes
again
expressed
the
hope
that
they
would
carry
out
their
intentions
and
arrangements
were
made
with
the
tribes
that
they
should
come
down
and
live
with
them
it
is
stated
that
just
before
this
visiting
party
started
north
toward
their
home
news
came
from
the
pawnee
agency
that
the
tribe
had
been
attacked
and
massacred
on
the
republican
river
by
sioux
and
as
they
journeyed
north
they
learned
the
details
of
the
occurrence
on
reaching
the
village
spotted
horse
and
frank
white
reported
to
lone
chief
and
to
their
families
what
they
had
done
and
their
action
was
confirmed
the
chiefs
of
the
tribe
and
the
agent
were
then
notified
soon
afterward
a
general
council
was
held
at
which
public
announcement
of
their
intention
was
made
by
these
three
men
to
most
of
those
present
the
project
was
wholly
new
and
there
was
a
good
deal
of
confusion
in
the
council
the
people
exclaiming
at
the
news
and
discussing
it
efforts
were
made
by
the
chiefs
of
the
bands
to
dissuade
those
who
proposed
to
move
the
head
chief
tried
to
persuade
frank
white
not
to
leave
the
tribe
but
he
said
that
he
had
promised
and
he
should
go
in
the
autumn
of
lone
chief
spotted
horse
and
frank
white
accompanied
by
their
personal
following
started
south
with
them
went
about
of
the
tribe
the
three
leaders
had
a
pass
from
the
superintendent
of
indian
affairs
at
the
pawnee
agency
the
chiefs
of
the
tribe
were
still
bitterly
opposed
to
the
notion
of
the
removal
and
the
head
chief
exerted
all
his
influence
to
prevent
the
movement
after
the
migrating
party
had
gone
about
fifty
miles
messengers
from
the
chiefs
overtook
them
directing
them
to
return
to
the
village
the
march
was
stopped
and
the
three
leaders
as
delegates
returned
to
the
agency
to
learn
the
cause
of
the
order
they
reached
there
in
the
evening
and
spent
the
whole
night
conferring
with
the
agent
burgess
to
whom
they
gave
presents
to
persuade
him
to
accede
to
their
request
to
continue
their
journey
lone
chief
was
the
most
determined
and
insisted
that
they
should
be
permitted
to
go
on
without
interference
at
length
the
authorities
yielded
and
a
new
pass
having
been
given
them
they
returned
to
the
camp
the
responsibility
of
taking
away
so
large
a
part
of
the
tribe
was
weighing
heavily
on
these
three
men
however
and
they
determined
to
send
back
all
except
their
own
families
on
reaching
the
camp
therefore
they
told
the
indians
that
they
all
were
to
go
back
but
hid
their
own
horses
pretending
that
they
had
strayed
off
so
that
the
main
body
would
start
back
without
them
after
the
others
had
moved
out
of
camp
on
their
return
march
to
the
agency
the
lost
horses
were
at
once
found
and
the
three
men
with
their
families
went
on
south
the
following
year
all
the
tribe
followed
except
the
skidi
lone
chief
and
a
few
personal
friends
who
still
refused
to
leave
the
old
reservation
this
small
company
remained
in
their
old
home
one
year
longer
and
then
they
too
went
south
to
their
present
reservation
shortly
before
the
removal
of
the
tribe
to
the
indian
territory
in
the
head
chief
was
shot
and
died
from
his
wound
it
has
been
stated
and
generally
believed
that
his
death
resulted
from
the
accidental
discharge
of
his
own
pistol
but
there
are
persons
who
believe
that
he
was
murdered
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
the
shot
did
not
come
from
his
own
weapon
but
that
he
was
shot
by
a
white
man
in
order
to
get
rid
of
his
influence
which
was
consistently
exerted
to
keep
the
pawnees
in
their
northern
home
the
chief
wound
was
not
a
serious
one
and
he
was
doing
well
under
the
charge
of
a
white
surgeon
when
he
was
induced
to
put
himself
in
the
care
of
a
pawnee
doctor
under
whose
treatment
he
died
another
bitter
opponent
of
removal
had
been
killed
in
and
the
death
of
left
lone
chief
skidi
the
only
man
of
strong
character
to
oppose
the
movement
the
full
history
of
the
plot
to
eject
the
pawnees
from
their
northern
home
may
never
be
recorded
for
there
are
few
men
alive
who
know
the
facts
if
it
should
be
written
there
would
be
disclosed
a
carefully
planned
and
successfully
carried
out
conspiracy
to
rob
this
people
of
their
lands
this
outrage
has
cost
hundreds
of
lives
and
an
inconceivable
amount
of
suffering
and
is
another
damning
and
ineffaceable
blot
on
the
record
of
the
american
people
and
one
which
ought
surely
to
have
had
a
place
in
jackson
century
of
dishonor
ii
present
condition
and
progress
during
the
first
four
years
of
their
sojourn
in
the
indian
territory
the
condition
of
the
pawnees
was
most
miserable
they
had
left
the
high
dry
sandy
country
of
the
loup
and
come
south
into
the
more
fertile
but
also
more
humid
country
of
the
indian
territory
where
they
found
a
region
entirely
different
from
that
to
which
they
had
been
accustomed
soon
after
their
settlement
on
their
new
reservation
they
were
attacked
by
fever
and
ague
a
disease
which
had
been
unknown
to
them
in
their
northern
home
and
many
of
them
died
while
all
were
so
weakened
by
disease
and
so
discouraged
by
homesickness
that
their
nature
seemed
wholly
changed
they
lost
their
old
spirit
and
their
energy
and
were
possessed
only
by
a
desire
to
return
to
their
northern
home
this
was
of
course
impossible
since
their
old
reservation
had
been
thrown
open
to
settlement
and
in
part
occupied
by
the
whites
during
the
first
ten
years
of
their
sojourn
in
the
territory
more
than
one
of
the
agents
appointed
to
look
after
the
pawnees
were
either
incompetent
or
dishonest
so
that
the
people
suffered
from
lack
of
food
and
some
of
them
even
starved
to
death
they
were
miserably
poor
for
they
did
not
know
how
to
work
and
no
one
tried
to
encourage
or
help
them
to
do
so
the
few
horses
which
they
had
were
stolen
from
them
by
white
horse
thieves
and
they
were
now
in
a
country
and
under
conditions
where
they
could
not
practice
their
old
war
methods
the
tribes
against
which
their
expeditions
had
once
been
made
were
now
their
neighbors
and
their
friends
when
major
north
and
his
brother
luther
visited
the
agency
in
to
enlist
scouts
for
general
crook
northern
campaign
they
found
the
pawnees
in
a
pitiable
condition
they
were
without
food
without
clothing
without
arms
and
without
horses
their
sole
covering
consisted
of
cotton
sheets
which
afforded
no
protection
against
cold
and
wet
it
is
not
strange
that
under
such
circumstances
the
people
died
off
fast
at
this
time
major
north
had
orders
to
enlist
only
one
hundred
scouts
but
he
was
greatly
perplexed
in
selecting
his
men
for
four
hundred
wanted
to
go
with
him
every
man
in
the
tribe
and
many
who
were
not
tried
to
get
their
names
on
the
muster
roll
each
man
at
any
cost
sought
to
get
away
from
the
suffering
of
his
present
life
from
the
fever
that
made
him
quake
the
chill
that
caused
him
to
shiver
and
above
all
from
the
deadly
monotony
of
the
reservation
life
after
major
north
had
enlisted
his
quota
of
men
and
started
with
them
on
his
way
north
more
than
a
hundred
others
followed
him
on
foot
to
arkansas
city
in
the
hope
that
he
could
be
persuaded
to
increase
his
force
or
else
that
some
of
those
enlisted
would
drop
out
through
sickness
and
there
might
be
room
for
others
the
wretched
condition
of
the
pawnees
continued
up
to
about
or
before
this
time
the
people
had
become
in
a
measure
acclimated
in
their
new
home
and
had
come
to
realize
that
it
was
absolutely
necessary
for
them
to
go
to
work
if
the
tribe
was
to
continue
to
exist
they
began
to
work
at
first
only
a
few
but
gradually
many
of
the
skidi
and
then
the
and
the
presently
a
point
was
reached
where
it
was
no
longer
necessary
to
issue
them
government
rations
they
raised
enough
on
their
farms
to
support
themselves
each
year
of
late
they
have
done
better
and
better
a
drought
one
season
and
a
cyclone
another
destroyed
their
crops
but
undiscouraged
and
undaunted
they
push
ahead
striving
earnestly
to
become
like
white
men
the
are
the
least
progressive
of
the
four
bands
and
many
of
them
still
live
in
dirt
lodges
and
cultivate
patches
of
corn
scarcely
larger
than
those
tilled
in
their
old
villages
but
as
the
other
bands
advance
and
as
the
results
of
manual
labor
are
seen
and
understood
by
those
who
are
more
idle
they
too
will
catch
the
spirit
of
progress
and
will
lay
hold
of
the
plow
last
march
as
i
drove
along
toward
the
agency
and
as
we
came
in
sight
of
black
bear
creek
i
was
surprised
to
see
what
looked
like
good
farm
houses
dotting
the
distant
bottom
a
nearer
view
and
a
closer
investigation
showed
me
that
the
most
of
the
pawnees
live
in
houses
as
good
as
those
of
many
a
new
england
land
owner
and
very
much
better
than
those
inhabited
by
new
settlers
in
the
farther
west
many
of
them
have
considerable
farms
under
fence
a
barn
a
garden
in
which
vegetables
are
raised
and
a
peach
orchard
they
realize
that
as
yet
they
are
only
beginning
but
to
me
who
knew
them
in
their
old
barbaric
condition
their
progress
seems
a
marvel
nowadays
by
far
the
greater
number
of
the
pawnees
wear
civilized
clothing
ride
in
wagons
and
send
their
children
to
the
agency
school
they
are
making
rapid
strides
toward
civilization
just
such
progress
as
might
be
expected
from
the
intelligent
and
courageous
people
that
they
are
and
always
have
been
the
pawnees
receive
from
the
government
a
perpetual
annuity
of
thirty
thousand
dollars
of
which
is
paid
in
money
and
in
goods
besides
this
they
have
a
credit
with
the
government
of
about
two
hundred
and
eighty
thousand
dollars
the
proceeds
of
the
sale
of
their
old
reservation
in
nebraska
on
which
they
receive
interest
and
for
some
years
past
they
have
leased
to
cattlemen
about
one
hundred
and
thousand
acres
of
their
reservation
for
which
they
receive
about
three
thousand
eight
hundred
dollars
per
annum
it
will
thus
be
seen
that
in
addition
to
the
crops
which
they
raise
the
tribe
is
fairly
well
provided
with
money
while
a
considerable
part
of
this
is
of
course
wasted
being
spent
for
trifles
and
for
luxuries
it
is
nevertheless
the
fact
that
a
certain
proportion
of
it
is
invested
by
the
indians
in
tools
farming
implements
and
in
furniture
three
years
ago
the
indians
merely
dropped
their
corn
into
the
furrow
while
some
planted
with
a
hoe
there
was
then
only
one
on
the
reservation
now
there
are
thirteen
of
these
implements
of
improved
pattern
bought
by
the
indians
and
paid
for
with
their
own
money
reapers
and
mowers
belong
to
the
indian
department
and
are
loaned
not
issued
and
these
pass
round
from
one
family
to
another
within
the
last
four
years
one
hundred
breaking
and
stirring
plows
have
been
issued
and
one
hundred
and
five
double
shovel
cultivators
eighty
wagons
and
one
hundred
and
fifty
sets
of
harness
have
been
issued
in
the
same
length
of
time
besides
these
eight
cultivators
are
loaned
them
by
the
government
the
pawnees
seem
to
be
saving
up
their
money
to
put
into
farming
implements
and
they
are
looking
ahead
of
the
houses
built
in
the
last
three
years
have
been
built
by
the
who
are
pushing
the
skidi
hard
in
their
advance
toward
civilization

the
indians
during

and

in
a
severe
cyclone
and
hail
storm
destroyed
the
growing
crops
and
in
a
prolonged
drought
again
ruined
them
during
these
two
years
it
was
necessary
to
issue
to
the
indians
half
rations
and
rations
respectively
this
year
no
rations
have
been
issued
as
will
be
seen
by
these
figures
corn
is
the
principal
crop
raised
by
the
pawnees
and
a
large
part
of
the
surplus
beyond
their
own
wants
is
sold
at
from
to
fifty
cents
a
bushel
to
the
dealers
in
arkansas
city
or
to
the
cattlemen
in
the
neighborhood
the
pawnees
have
as
yet
few
cattle
their
old
habits
have
not
yet
been
overcome
and
there
is
a
tendency
among
them
to
eat
any
cattle
they
may
obtain
rather
than
to
use
them
for
breeding
purposes
they
ought
to
be
encouraged
to
keep
cattle
to
which
they
could
feed
their
corn
and
in
this
way
obtain
a
better
return
for
their
labor
than
is
yielded
by
the
direct
sale
of
the
grain
they
are
fairly
well
provided
with
horses
but
most
of
these
are
small
and
of
the
indian
pony
type
they
should
be
encouraged
to
raise
a
better
class
of
horses
and
at
least
two
well
bred
heavy
stallions
should
be
kept
by
the
government
at
pawnee
for
indian
use
there
is
one
now
at
ponca
miles
away
but
the
pawnees
will
not
take
their
mares
so
far
much
of
the
improvement
in
the
condition
of
the
pawnees
has
taken
place
within
the
last
three
years
and
much
of
it
has
been
due
as
i
believe
to
the
wisdom
and
judgment
of
major
osborne
their
agent
and
to
the
mckenzie
who
have
for
three
years
or
more
been
the
clerks
directly
in
charge
of
these
people
these
gentlemen
appear
to
have
been
honest
and
firm
and
yet
helpful
in
their
treatment
of
the
people
under
their
charge
and
the
results
of
their
administration
show
for
themselves
and
are
something
in
which
these
officials
may
feel
a
just
pride
few
and
rapidly
diminishing
in
numbers
as
are
the
pawnee
people
i
have
yet
confidence
that
by
the
innate
strength
of
their
character
their
decline
may
be
checked
and
their
race
may
rise
again
it
can
never
do
so
in
its
old
purity
it
must
take
to
itself
fresh
blood
from
other
stocks
and
thus
renew
its
vitality
what
i
hope
for
the
pawnee
and
in
the
future
is
that
the
native
vigor
of
the
race
the
strong
heart
and
singleness
of
purpose
which
in
ancient
times
led
the
wild
brave
to
success
on
his
warpath
and
gave
his
tribe
so
high
a
place
among
the
savage
warriors
of
the
plains
may
now
be
exercised
in
the
pursuits
of
peace
and
that
the
same
qualities
may
give
to
these
earnest
toilers
as
they
tread
new
paths
strength
courage
and
endurance
to
hold
a
front
rank
among
those
indians
who
so
far
behind
are
nevertheless
resolutely
setting
their
steps
toward
a
place
with
civilized
people
but
whatever
the
fate
of
the
pawnee
people
whether
like
so
many
other
native
stocks
it
shall
dwindle
away
and
disappear
leaving
behind
it
no
reminder
of
its
existence
or
whether
its
native
force
shall
enable
it
under
its
new
conditions
to
survive
and
make
some
mark
we
may
remember
it
always
as
a
race
of
strong
brave
people
whose
good
qualities
are
deserving
of
more
than
a
passing
tribute
it
was
the
last
day
of
my
stay
at
the
pawnee
agency
i
had
seen
many
an
old
friend
had
laughed
and
joked
with
some
over
incidents
of
former
years
and
with
others
had
mourned
over
brave
warriors
or
wise
old
men
who
were
no
longer
with
us
my
visit
had
been
full
of
pleasure
and
yet
full
of
pain
when
i
had
first
known
the
tribe
it
numbered
more
than
three
thousand
people
now
there
are
only
a
little
more
than
eight
hundred
of
them
the
evidences
of
their
progress
toward
civilization
are
cheering
they
are
now
they
no
longer
die
of
hunger
but
the
character
of
the
people
has
changed
in
the
old
barbaric
days
they
were
merry
makers
of
jokes
keenly
alive
to
the
humorous
side
of
life
now
they
are
serious
grave
little
disposed
to
laugh
then
they
were
like
children
without
a
care
now
they
are
like
men
on
whom
the
anxieties
of
life
weigh
heavily
civilization
bringing
with
it
some
measure
of
material
prosperity
has
also
brought
to
these
people
care
responsibility
repression
no
doubt
it
is
best
and
it
is
inevitable
but
it
is
sad
too
it
was
my
last
day
and
i
was
again
sitting
with
eagle
chief
telling
him
that
the
time
had
come
for
me
to
go
he
said
ah
my
son
i
like
to
see
you
here
i
like
to
sit
with
you
and
to
talk
over
the
old
times
my
heart
is
sick
when
i
think
that
you
are
going
away
and
that
we
may
never
see
each
other
any
more
but
he
added
solemnly
it
may
be
that
will
be
good
to
us
and
will
let
us
live
a
long
time
until
we
are
very
old
and
then
some
day
we
may
meet
again
