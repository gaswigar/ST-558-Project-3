chapter
i
the
brunnenthal
peacock
if
ever
there
was
a
tory
upon
earth
the
frau
frohmann
was
a
tory
for
i
hold
that
landed
possessions
gentle
blood
a
butler
behind
one
s
chair
and
adherence
to
the
church
of
england
are
not
necessarily
the
distinguishing
marks
of
toryism
the
frau
frohmann
was
a
woman
who
loved
power
but
who
loved
to
use
it
for
the
benefit
of
those
around
her
or
at
any
rate
to
think
that
she
so
used
it
she
believed
in
the
principles
of
despotism
and
paternal
government
but
always
on
the
understanding
that
she
was
to
be
the
despot
in
her
heart
of
hearts
she
disliked
education
thinking
that
it
unfitted
the
minds
of
her
humbler
brethren
for
the
duties
of
their
lives
she
hated
indeed
all
changes
changes
in
costume
changes
in
hours
changes
in
cookery
and
changes
in
furniture
but
of
all
changes
she
perhaps
hated
changes
in
prices
the
most
gradually
there
had
come
over
her
a
melancholy
conviction
that
the
world
can
not
go
on
altogether
unaltered
there
was
she
felt
a
fate
in
things
a
necessity
which
in
some
dark
way
within
her
own
mind
she
connected
with
the
fall
of
adam
and
the
general
imperfection
of
humanity
which
demanded
changes
but
they
were
always
changes
for
the
worse
and
therefore
though
to
those
around
her
she
was
mostly
silent
on
this
matter
she
was
afflicted
by
a
general
idea
that
the
world
was
going
on
towards
ruin
that
all
things
throve
with
herself
was
not
sufficient
for
her
comfort
for
being
a
good
woman
with
a
large
heart
she
was
anxious
for
the
welfare
not
only
of
herself
and
of
her
children
but
for
that
of
all
who
might
come
after
her
at
any
rate
in
her
own
locality
thus
when
she
found
that
there
was
a
tendency
to
dine
at
one
instead
of
twelve
to
wear
the
same
clothes
on
week
days
as
on
sundays
to
desire
easy
chairs
and
linen
that
should
be
bleached
absolutely
white
thoughts
as
to
the
failing
condition
of
the
world
would
get
the
better
of
her
and
make
her
melancholy
these
traits
are
perhaps
the
evidences
of
the
weakness
of
toryism
but
then
frau
frohmann
also
had
all
its
strength
she
was
thoroughly
pervaded
by
a
determination
that
in
as
far
as
in
her
lay
all
that
had
aught
to
do
with
herself
should
be
in
the
world
it
was
a
grand
ambition
in
her
mind
that
every
creature
connected
with
her
establishment
from
the
oldest
and
most
guest
down
to
the
last
stray
cat
that
had
taken
refuge
under
her
roof
should
always
have
enough
to
eat
hunger
unsatisfied
hunger
disagreeable
hunger
on
the
part
of
any
dependent
of
hers
would
have
been
a
reproach
to
her
her
own
eating
troubled
her
little
or
not
at
all
but
the
cooking
of
the
establishment
generally
was
a
great
care
to
her
mind
in
bargaining
she
was
perhaps
hard
but
hard
only
in
getting
what
she
believed
to
be
her
own
right
aristides
was
not
more
just
of
bonds
written
bonds
her
neighbours
knew
not
much
but
her
word
for
twenty
miles
round
was
as
good
as
any
bond
and
though
she
was
perhaps
a
little
apt
to
domineer
in
her
bargains
to
expect
that
she
should
fix
the
prices
and
to
resent
opposition
it
was
only
to
the
strong
that
she
was
tyrannical
the
poor
sick
widow
and
the
little
orphan
could
generally
deal
with
her
at
their
own
rates
on
which
occasions
she
would
endeavour
to
hide
her
dealings
from
her
own
people
and
would
give
injunctions
to
the
favoured
ones
that
the
details
of
the
transaction
should
not
be
made
public
and
then
though
the
frau
was
i
regret
to
say
no
better
than
a
papist
she
was
a
thoroughly
religious
woman
believing
in
real
truth
what
she
professed
to
believe
and
complying
as
far
as
she
knew
how
with
the
ordinances
of
her
creed
therefore
i
say
that
if
ever
there
was
a
tory
the
frau
frohmann
was
one
and
now
it
will
be
well
that
the
reader
should
see
the
residence
of
the
frau
and
learn
something
of
her
condition
in
life
in
one
of
the
districts
of
the
tyrol
lying
some
miles
south
of
innsbruck
between
that
town
and
brixen
there
is
a
valley
called
the
brunnenthal
a
most
charming
spot
in
which
all
the
delights
of
scenery
may
be
found
without
the
necessity
of
climbing
up
mountains
or
sitting
in
oily
steamboats
or
paying
for
greedy
guides
or
riding
upon
ponies
in
this
valley
frau
frohmann
kept
an
hotel
called
the
peacock
which
however
though
it
was
known
as
an
inn
and
was
called
by
that
name
could
hardly
be
regarded
as
a
house
of
common
public
entertainment
its
purpose
was
to
afford
recreation
and
comfort
to
a
certain
class
of
customers
during
the
summer
months
persons
well
enough
to
do
in
the
world
to
escape
from
their
town
work
and
their
town
residences
for
a
short
holiday
and
desirous
during
that
time
of
enjoying
picturesque
scenery
good
living
moderate
comfort
and
some
amount
of
society
such
institutions
have
now
become
so
common
that
there
is
hardly
any
one
who
has
not
visited
or
at
any
rate
seen
such
a
place
they
are
to
be
found
in
every
country
in
europe
and
are
very
common
in
america
our
own
scotland
is
full
of
them
but
when
the
peacock
was
first
opened
in
brunnenthal
they
were
not
so
general
of
the
husband
of
the
frau
there
are
not
many
records
in
the
neighbourhood
the
widow
has
been
a
widow
for
the
last
twenty
years
at
least
and
her
children
for
she
has
a
son
and
daughter
have
no
vivid
memories
of
their
father
the
house
and
everything
in
it
and
the
adjacent
farm
and
the
right
of
cutting
timber
in
the
forests
and
the
neighbouring
quarry
are
all
the
undoubted
property
of
the
frau
who
has
a
reputation
for
great
wealth
though
her
son
is
perhaps
nearly
thirty
and
is
very
diligent
in
the
affairs
of
the
establishment
he
has
no
real
authority
he
is
only
as
it
were
the
right
hand
of
his
mother
as
his
sister
who
is
perhaps
five
years
younger
is
an
right
hand
but
they
are
only
hands
the
brain
the
intelligence
the
mind
the
will
by
which
the
brunnenthal
peacock
is
conducted
and
managed
come
all
from
the
frau
frohmann
herself
to
this
day
she
can
hardly
endure
a
suggestion
either
from
peter
her
son
or
from
her
daughter
amalia
who
is
known
among
her
friends
as
malchen
but
is
called
the
fraulein
by
the
brunnenthal
world
at
large
a
suggestion
as
to
the
purchase
of
things
new
in
their
nature
she
will
not
stand
at
all
though
she
is
liberal
enough
in
maintaining
the
appurtenances
of
the
house
generally
but
the
peacock
is
more
than
a
house
it
is
almost
a
village
and
yet
every
shed
cottage
or
barn
at
or
near
the
place
forms
a
part
of
the
frau
s
establishment
the
centre
or
main
building
is
a
large
ordinary
house
of
three
stories
to
the
lower
of
which
there
is
an
ascent
by
some
stone
steps
covered
with
red
tiles
and
with
gable
ends
crowded
with
innumerable
windows
the
is
devoted
to
kitchens
offices
the
frau
s
own
uses
and
the
needs
of
the
servants
on
the
are
the
two
living
rooms
of
the
guests
the
greater
and
by
far
the
more
important
being
devoted
to
eating
and
drinking
here
at
certain
hours
are
collected
all
the
forces
of
the
establishment
and
especially
at
one
o
clock
when
with
many
ringing
of
bells
and
great
struggles
in
the
culinary
department
the
dinner
is
served
for
to
the
adoption
of
this
hour
has
the
frau
at
last
been
driven
by
the
increasing
infirmities
of
the
world
around
her
the
scenery
of
the
locality
is
lovely
the
air
is
considered
to
be
peculiarly
the
gossipings
during
the
untrammelled
idleness
of
the
day
are
very
grateful
to
those
whose
lives
are
generally
laborious
the
are
frequent
and
no
doubt
sweet
skittles
and
bowls
and
draughts
and
dominoes
have
their
devotees
and
the
smoking
of
many
pipes
fills
up
the
vacant
hours
of
the
men
but
at
the
brunnenthal
dinner
is
the
great
glory
of
the
day
it
would
be
vain
for
any
Ã¦sthetical
guest
who
might
conceive
himself
to
be
superior
to
the
allurements
of
the
table
to
make
little
of
the
frau
s
dinner
such
a
one
had
better
seek
other
quarters
for
his
summer
s
holiday
at
the
brunnenthal
peacock
it
is
necessary
that
you
should
believe
in
the
paramount
importance
of
dinner
not
to
come
to
it
at
the
appointed
time
would
create
first
marvel
in
the
frau
s
mind
then
pity
as
to
the
state
of
your
health
and
at
last
hot
anger
should
it
be
found
that
such
neglect
arose
from
contempt
what
muse
will
assist
me
to
describe
these
dinners
in
a
few
words
they
were
commenced
of
course
by
soup
real
soup
not
barley
broth
with
a
strong
prevalence
of
the
barley
then
would
follow
the
boiled
meats
from
which
the
soup
was
supposed
to
have
been
made
but
such
boiled
meat
so
good
that
the
supposition
must
have
contained
a
falsehood
with
this
there
would
be
always
potatoes
and
pickled
cabbages
and
various
relishes
then
there
would
be
two
other
kinds
of
meat
generally
with
accompaniment
of
stewed
fruit
after
that
fish
trout
from
the
neighbouring
stream
for
the
preservation
of
which
great
tanks
had
been
made
vegetables
with
unknown
sauces
would
follow
and
then
would
come
the
roast
which
consisted
always
of
poultry
and
was
accompanied
of
course
by
salad
but
it
was
after
this
that
were
made
the
efforts
on
which
the
frau
s
fame
most
depended
the
puddings
i
think
were
the
subject
of
her
greatest
struggles
and
most
complete
success
two
puddings
daily
were
by
the
rules
of
the
house
required
to
be
eaten
not
two
puddings
brought
together
so
that
you
might
choose
with
careless
haste
either
one
or
the
other
but
two
separate
courses
of
puddings
with
an
interval
between
for
appreciation
for
thought
and
for
digestion
either
one
or
both
can
no
doubt
be
declined
no
absolute
punishment
such
as
notice
to
leave
the
house
follows
such
abstention
but
the
frau
is
displeased
and
when
dressed
in
her
best
on
sundays
does
not
smile
on
those
who
abstain
after
the
puddings
there
is
dessert
and
there
are
little
cakes
to
nibble
if
you
will
they
are
nibbled
very
freely
but
the
heat
of
the
battle
is
over
with
the
second
pudding
they
have
a
great
fame
these
banquets
so
that
ladies
and
gentlemen
from
innsbruck
have
themselves
driven
out
here
to
enjoy
them
the
distance
each
way
is
from
two
to
three
hours
so
that
a
pleasant
holiday
is
made
by
a
visit
to
the
frau
s
establishment
there
is
a
ramble
up
to
the
waterfall
and
a
smoking
of
pipes
among
the
rocks
and
pleasant
opportunities
for
secret
whispers
among
young
people
but
the
frau
would
not
be
well
pleased
if
it
were
presumed
that
the
great
inducement
for
the
visit
were
not
to
be
found
in
the
dinner
which
she
provides
in
this
way
though
the
guests
at
the
house
may
not
exceed
perhaps
thirty
in
number
it
will
sometimes
be
the
case
that
nearly
twice
as
many
are
seated
at
the
board
that
the
frau
has
an
eye
to
profit
can
not
be
doubted
fond
of
money
she
is
certainly
fond
of
prosperity
generally
but
judging
merely
from
what
comes
beneath
his
eye
the
observer
will
be
led
to
suppose
that
her
sole
ambition
on
these
occasions
is
to
see
the
food
which
she
has
provided
devoured
by
her
guests
a
weak
stomach
a
halting
appetite
conscientious
scruples
as
to
the
of
victuals
restraint
in
reference
to
subsequent
excesses
or
subsequent
eatings
all
these
things
are
a
scandal
to
her
if
you
can
t
or
won
t
or
don
t
eat
your
dinner
when
you
get
it
you
ought
not
to
go
to
the
brunnenthal
peacock
this
or
occupies
a
great
part
of
the
but
here
also
is
the
or
as
it
is
called
having
over
the
door
painted
so
that
its
purpose
may
not
be
doubted
but
the
is
not
much
and
the
guests
generally
spend
their
time
chiefly
out
of
doors
or
in
their
bedrooms
when
they
are
not
banqueting
there
are
two
other
banquets
breakfast
and
supper
which
need
not
be
specially
described
but
of
the
latter
it
may
be
said
that
it
is
a
curtailed
dinner
having
limited
courses
of
hot
meat
and
only
one
pudding
on
this
floor
there
is
a
bedroom
or
two
and
a
nest
of
others
above
but
the
accommodation
is
chiefly
afforded
in
other
buildings
of
which
the
one
opposite
is
longer
though
not
so
high
as
the
central
house
and
there
is
another
a
little
down
the
road
near
the
mill
and
another
as
far
up
the
stream
where
the
baths
have
been
built
an
innovation
to
which
frau
frohmann
did
not
lend
herself
without
much
inward
suffering
and
there
are
huge
barns
and
many
stables
for
the
frau
keeps
a
posting
establishment
and
a
diligence
passes
the
door
three
times
each
way
in
the
course
of
the
day
and
night
and
the
horses
are
changed
at
the
peacock
or
it
was
so
at
any
rate
in
the
days
of
which
i
am
speaking
not
very
long
ago
and
there
is
the
blacksmith
s
forge
and
the
great
carpenter
s
shed
in
which
not
only
are
the
carts
and
carriages
mended
but
very
much
of
the
house
furniture
is
made
and
there
is
the
mill
as
has
been
said
before
in
which
the
corn
is
ground
and
three
or
four
cottages
for
married
men
and
a
pretty
little
chapel
built
by
the
frau
herself
in
which
mass
is
performed
by
her
favourite
priest
once
a
month
for
the
parish
chapel
is
nearly
three
miles
distant
if
you
walk
by
the
mountain
path
but
is
fully
five
if
you
have
yourself
carried
round
by
the
coach
road
it
must
i
think
be
many
years
since
the
frau
can
have
walked
there
for
she
is
a
dame
of
portly
dimensions
whether
the
buildings
are
in
themselves
picturesque
i
will
not
pretend
to
say
i
doubt
whether
there
has
been
an
attempt
that
way
in
regard
to
any
one
except
the
chapel
but
chance
has
so
grouped
them
and
nature
has
so
surrounded
them
that
you
can
hardly
find
anywhere
a
prettier
spot
behind
the
house
so
as
to
leave
only
space
for
a
little
meadow
which
is
always
as
green
as
irrigation
can
make
it
a
hill
rises
not
high
enough
to
be
called
a
mountain
which
is
from
the
foot
to
the
summit
in
front
and
around
the
ground
is
broken
but
immediately
before
the
door
there
is
a
way
up
to
a
lateral
valley
down
which
comes
a
nameless
stream
which
just
below
the
house
makes
its
way
into
the
ivil
the
little
river
which
runs
from
the
mountain
to
the
inn
taking
its
course
through
that
meadow
which
lies
between
the
hill
and
the
house
it
is
here
a
quarter
of
a
mile
perhaps
up
this
little
stream
at
a
spot
which
is
hidden
by
many
turnings
from
the
road
that
visitors
come
upon
the
waterfall
the
waterfall
which
at
innsbruck
is
so
often
made
to
be
the
excuse
of
these
outings
which
are
in
truth
performed
in
quest
of
frau
frohmann
s
dinners
below
the
peacock
where
the
mill
is
placed
the
valley
is
closely
confined
as
the
sombre
rise
abruptly
on
each
side
and
here
or
very
little
lower
is
that
gloomy
or
pass
through
the
rocks
which
is
called
the
hÃ¶llenthor
a
name
which
i
will
not
translate
but
it
is
a
narrow
ravine
very
dark
in
dark
weather
and
at
night
as
black
as
pitch
among
the
superstitious
people
of
the
valley
the
spot
is
regarded
with
the
awe
which
belonged
to
it
in
past
ages
to
visitors
of
the
present
day
it
is
simply
picturesque
and
sublime
above
the
house
the
valley
spreads
itself
rising
however
rapidly
and
here
modern
engineering
has
carried
the
road
in
various
curves
and
turns
round
knolls
of
hills
and
spurs
of
mountains
till
the
traveller
as
he
ascends
hardly
knows
which
way
he
is
going
from
one
or
two
points
among
these
curves
the
view
down
upon
the
peacock
with
its
various
appendages
with
its
roofs
and
many
windows
glittering
in
the
sun
is
so
charming
that
the
tourist
is
almost
led
to
think
that
they
must
all
have
been
placed
as
they
are
with
a
view
to
effect
the
frau
herself
is
what
used
to
be
called
a
personable
woman
to
say
that
she
is
handsome
would
hardly
convey
a
proper
idea
let
the
reader
suppose
a
woman
of
about
fifty
very
tall
and
of
large
dimensions
it
would
be
unjust
to
call
her
fat
because
though
very
large
she
is
still
symmetrical
when
she
is
dressed
in
her
full
tyrolese
costume
which
is
always
the
case
at
a
certain
hour
on
sunday
and
on
other
stated
and
by
no
means
unfrequent
days
as
to
which
i
was
never
quite
able
to
learn
the
exact
rule
when
she
is
so
dressed
her
arms
are
bare
down
from
her
shoulders
and
such
arms
i
never
saw
on
any
human
being
her
back
is
very
broad
and
her
bust
expansive
but
her
head
stands
erect
upon
it
as
the
head
of
some
old
juno
and
in
all
her
motions
though
i
doubt
whether
she
could
climb
by
the
mountain
path
to
her
parish
church
she
displays
a
certain
stately
alertness
which
forbids
one
to
call
her
fat
her
smile
when
she
really
means
to
smile
and
to
show
thereby
her
and
to
be
gracious
is
as
sweet
as
hebe
s
then
it
is
that
you
see
that
in
her
prime
she
must
in
truth
have
been
a
lovely
woman
there
is
at
these
moments
a
kindness
in
her
eyes
and
a
playfulness
about
her
mouth
which
is
apt
to
make
you
think
that
you
can
do
what
you
like
with
the
frau
who
has
not
at
times
been
charmed
by
the
frolic
playfulness
of
the
tiger
not
that
frau
frohmann
has
aught
of
the
tiger
in
her
nature
but
its
power
but
the
power
is
all
there
and
not
unfrequently
the
signs
of
power
if
she
be
thwarted
contradicted
counselled
by
unauthorised
counsellors
above
all
if
she
be
censured
then
the
signs
of
power
are
shown
then
the
frau
does
not
smile
at
such
times
she
is
wont
to
speak
her
mind
very
plainly
and
to
make
those
who
hear
her
understand
that
within
the
precincts
and
purlieus
of
the
brunnenthal
peacock
she
is
an
irresponsible
despot
there
have
been
guests
there
rash
enough
to
find
some
trifling
faults
with
the
comforts
provided
for
them
whose
beds
perhaps
have
been
too
hard
or
their
towels
too
limited
or
perhaps
their
hours
not
agreeably
arranged
for
them
few
however
have
ever
done
so
twice
and
they
who
have
so
sinned
and
have
then
been
told
that
the
next
diligence
would
take
them
quickly
to
innsbruck
if
they
were
discontented
have
rarely
stuck
to
their
complaints
and
gone
the
comforts
of
the
house
and
the
prices
charged
and
the
general
charms
of
the
place
have
generally
prevailed
so
that
the
complainants
sometimes
with
spoken
apologies
have
in
most
cases
sought
permission
to
remain
in
late
years
the
frau
s
certainty
of
victory
has
created
a
feeling
that
nothing
is
to
be
said
against
the
arrangements
of
the
peacock
a
displeased
guest
can
exercise
his
displeasure
best
by
taking
himself
away
in
silence
the
frau
of
late
years
has
had
two
counsellors
for
though
she
is
but
ill
inclined
to
admit
advice
from
those
who
have
received
no
authority
to
give
it
she
is
not
therefore
so
as
to
feel
that
she
can
live
and
thrive
without
listening
to
the
wisdom
of
others
and
those
two
counsellors
may
be
regarded
as
representing
the
first
or
elder
her
conscience
and
the
second
and
younger
her
worldly
prudence
and
in
the
matter
of
her
conscience
very
much
more
is
concerned
than
simple
honesty
it
is
not
against
cheating
or
extortion
that
her
counsellor
is
sharp
to
her
but
rather
in
regard
to
those
innovations
which
he
and
she
think
to
be
prejudicial
to
the
manner
and
life
of
brunnenthal
of
innsbruck
of
the
tyrol
of
the
austrian
empire
generally
and
indeed
of
the
world
at
large
to
be
as
her
father
had
been
before
her
for
her
father
too
had
kept
the
peacock
to
let
life
be
cheap
and
simple
but
yet
very
plentiful
as
it
had
been
in
his
days
this
was
the
counsel
given
by
father
conolin
the
old
priest
who
always
spent
two
nights
in
each
month
at
the
establishment
and
was
not
unfrequently
to
be
seen
there
on
other
occasions
he
had
been
opposed
to
many
things
which
had
been
effected
that
alteration
of
the
hour
of
dinner
the
erection
of
the
bathhouse
the
changing
of
plates
at
each
course
and
especially
certain
notifications
and
advertisements
by
which
foreigners
may
have
been
induced
to
come
to
the
brunnenthal
the
kaplan
or
chaplain
as
he
was
called
was
particularly
averse
to
strangers
seeming
to
think
that
the
advantages
of
the
place
should
be
reserved
if
not
altogether
for
the
tyrolese
at
any
rate
for
the
germans
of
southern
germany
and
was
probably
of
opinion
that
no
real
good
could
be
obtained
by
harbouring
lutherans
but
of
late
english
also
had
come
to
whom
though
he
was
personally
very
courteous
he
was
much
averse
in
his
heart
of
hearts
such
had
ever
been
the
tendency
of
his
advice
and
it
had
always
been
received
with
willing
nay
with
loving
ears
but
the
fate
of
the
kaplan
had
been
as
is
the
fate
of
all
such
counsellors
let
the
toryism
of
the
tory
be
ever
so
strong
it
is
his
destiny
to
carry
out
the
purposes
of
his
opponents
so
it
had
been
and
was
with
the
frau
though
she
was
always
in
spirit
antagonistic
to
the
other
counsellor
it
was
the
other
counsellor
who
prevailed
with
her
at
innsbruck
for
many
years
there
had
lived
a
lawyer
or
rather
a
family
of
lawyers
men
always
of
good
repute
and
moderate
means
named
schlessen
and
in
their
hands
had
been
reposed
by
the
frau
that
confidence
as
to
business
matters
which
almost
every
one
in
business
must
have
in
some
lawyer
the
first
schlessen
whom
the
frau
had
known
in
her
youth
and
who
was
then
a
very
old
man
had
been
almost
as
conservative
as
the
priest
then
had
come
his
son
who
had
been
less
so
but
still
lived
and
died
without
much
either
of
the
light
of
progress
or
contamination
of
revolutionary
ideas
from
the
outer
world
but
about
three
years
before
the
date
of
our
tale
he
also
had
passed
away
and
now
young
fritz
schlessen
sat
in
the
chair
of
his
forefathers
it
was
the
opinion
of
innsbruck
generally
that
the
young
lawyer
was
certainly
equal
probably
superior
in
attainments
and
intellect
to
any
of
his
predecessors
he
had
learned
his
business
both
at
munich
and
vienna
and
though
he
was
only
when
he
was
left
to
manage
his
clients
himself
most
of
them
adhered
to
him
among
others
so
did
our
frau
and
this
she
did
knowing
the
nature
of
the
man
and
of
the
counsel
she
might
expect
to
receive
from
him
for
though
she
loved
the
priest
and
loved
her
old
ways
and
loved
to
be
told
that
she
could
live
and
thrive
on
the
rules
by
which
her
father
had
lived
and
thriven
before
her
still
there
was
always
present
to
her
mind
the
fact
that
she
was
engaged
in
trade
and
that
the
first
object
of
a
tradesman
must
be
to
make
money
no
shoemaker
can
set
himself
to
work
to
make
shoes
having
as
his
first
intention
an
ambition
to
make
the
feet
of
his
customers
comfortable
that
may
come
second
and
to
him
as
a
conscientious
man
may
be
essentially
necessary
but
he
sets
himself
to
work
to
make
shoes
in
order
that
he
may
earn
a
living
that
law
almost
of
nature
we
may
say
had
become
so
recognised
by
the
frau
that
she
felt
that
it
must
be
followed
even
in
spite
of
the
priest
if
need
were
and
that
in
order
that
it
might
be
followed
it
would
be
well
that
she
should
listen
to
the
advice
of
herr
schlessen
she
heard
therefore
all
that
her
kaplan
would
say
to
her
with
gracious
smiles
and
something
of
what
her
lawyer
would
say
to
her
not
always
very
graciously
but
in
the
she
would
take
her
lawyer
s
advice
it
will
have
to
be
told
in
a
following
chapter
how
it
was
that
fritz
schlessen
had
a
preponderating
influence
in
the
brunnenthal
arising
from
other
causes
than
his
professional
soundness
and
general
prudence
it
may
however
be
as
well
to
explain
here
that
peter
frohmann
the
son
sided
always
with
the
priest
and
attached
himself
altogether
to
the
conservative
interest
but
he
though
he
was
honest
diligent
and
dutiful
to
his
mother
was
lumpy
uncouth
and
slow
both
of
speech
and
action
he
understood
the
cutting
of
timber
and
the
making
of
hay
something
perhaps
of
the
care
of
horses
and
of
the
nourishment
of
pigs
but
in
money
matters
he
was
not
efficient
amalia
or
malchen
the
daughter
who
was
four
or
five
years
her
brother
s
junior
was
much
brighter
and
she
was
strong
on
the
reforming
side
british
money
was
to
her
thinking
as
good
as
austrian
or
even
tyrolese
to
thrive
even
better
than
her
forefathers
had
thriven
seemed
to
her
to
be
desirable
she
therefore
though
by
her
brightness
and
feminine
ways
she
was
very
dear
to
the
priest
was
generally
opposed
to
him
in
the
family
conclaves
it
was
chiefly
in
consequence
of
her
persistency
that
the
table
napkins
at
the
peacock
were
now
changed
twice
a
week
chapter
ii
the
beginning
of
troubles
of
late
days
and
up
to
the
time
of
which
we
are
speaking
the
chief
contest
between
the
frau
with
the
kaplan
and
peter
on
one
side
and
malchen
with
fritz
schlessen
on
the
other
was
on
that
most
important
question
whether
the
whole
rate
of
charges
should
not
be
raised
at
the
establishment
the
prices
had
been
raised
no
doubt
within
the
last
twenty
years
or
the
frau
could
not
have
kept
her
house
open
but
this
had
been
done
indirectly
that
the
matter
may
not
be
complicated
for
our
readers
we
will
assume
that
all
charges
are
made
at
the
peacock
in
zwansigers
and
kreutzers
and
that
the
zwansiger
containing
twenty
kreutzers
is
worth
eightpence
of
english
money
now
it
must
be
understood
that
the
guests
at
the
peacock
were
entertained
at
the
rate
of
six
zwansigers
or
four
shillings
a
day
and
that
this
included
everything
necessary
a
bed
breakfast
dinner
a
cup
of
coffee
after
dinner
supper
as
much
fresh
milk
as
anybody
chose
to
drink
when
the
cows
were
milked
and
the
use
of
everything
in
and
about
the
establishment
guests
who
required
wine
or
beer
of
course
were
charged
for
what
they
had
those
who
were
rich
enough
to
be
taken
about
in
carriages
paid
so
much
per
job
each
separate
jaunt
having
been
inserted
in
a
tariff
no
doubt
there
were
other
possible
and
probable
extras
but
an
ordinary
guest
might
live
for
his
six
zwansigers
a
day
and
the
bulk
of
them
did
so
live
with
the
addition
of
whatever
allowance
of
beer
each
might
think
appropriate
from
time
to
time
a
little
had
been
added
to
the
cost
of
luxuries
wine
had
become
dearer
and
perhaps
the
carriages
a
bath
was
an
addition
to
the
bill
and
certain
larger
and
more
commodious
rooms
were
supposed
to
be
entitled
to
an
extra
zwansiger
per
week
but
the
main
charge
had
always
remained
fixed
in
the
time
of
the
frau
s
father
guests
had
been
entertained
at
let
us
say
four
shillings
a
head
and
guests
were
so
entertained
now
all
the
world
at
any
rate
all
the
tyrolese
world
south
of
innsbruck
knew
that
six
zwansigers
was
the
charge
in
the
brunnenthal
it
would
be
like
adding
a
new
difficulty
to
the
path
of
life
to
make
a
change
the
frau
had
always
held
her
head
high
had
never
been
ashamed
of
looking
her
neighbour
in
the
face
but
when
she
was
advised
to
rush
at
once
up
to
seven
zwansigers
and
a
half
or
five
shillings
a
day
she
felt
that
should
she
do
so
she
would
be
overwhelmed
with
shame
would
not
her
customers
then
have
cause
of
complaint
would
not
they
have
such
cause
that
they
would
in
truth
desert
her
did
she
not
know
that
herr
weiss
the
magistrate
from
brixen
with
his
wife
and
his
wife
s
sister
and
the
children
who
came
yearly
to
the
peacock
could
not
afford
to
bring
his
family
at
this
increased
rate
of
expenses
and
the
fraulein
tendel
with
her
sister
would
never
come
from
innsbruck
if
such
an
announcement
was
made
to
her
it
was
the
pride
of
this
woman
s
heart
to
give
all
that
was
necessary
for
good
living
to
those
who
would
come
and
submit
themselves
to
her
for
four
shillings
a
day
among
the
extras
she
could
endure
some
alteration
she
did
not
like
extras
and
if
people
would
have
luxuries
they
must
be
made
to
pay
for
them
but
the
peacock
had
always
been
kept
open
for
six
zwansigers
and
though
fritz
schlessen
was
very
eloquent
she
would
not
give
way
to
him
fritz
schlessen
simply
told
her
that
the
good
things
which
she
provided
for
her
guests
cost
at
present
more
than
six
zwansigers
and
could
not
therefore
be
sold
by
her
at
that
price
without
a
loss
she
was
rich
fritz
remarked
shrugging
his
shoulders
and
having
amassed
property
could
if
she
pleased
dispose
of
it
gradually
by
entertaining
her
guests
at
a
loss
to
herself
only
let
her
know
what
she
was
doing
that
might
be
charity
might
be
generosity
might
be
friendliness
but
it
was
not
trade
everything
else
in
the
world
had
become
dearer
and
therefore
living
at
the
peacock
should
be
dearer
as
to
the
weisses
and
the
tendels
no
doubt
they
might
be
shocked
and
perhaps
hindered
from
coming
but
their
places
would
surely
be
filled
by
others
was
not
the
house
always
full
from
the
of
june
till
the
end
of
september
were
not
strangers
refused
admittance
week
after
week
from
want
of
accommodation
if
the
new
prices
were
found
to
be
too
high
for
the
tyrolese
and
bavarians
they
would
not
offend
the
germans
from
the
rhine
or
the
belgians
or
the
english
was
it
not
plain
to
every
one
that
people
now
came
from
greater
distances
than
heretofore
these
were
the
arguments
which
herr
schlessen
used
and
though
they
were
very
disagreeable
they
were
not
easily
answered
the
frau
repudiated
altogether
the
idea
of
keeping
open
her
house
on
other
than
true
trade
principles
when
the
young
lawyer
talked
to
her
about
generosity
she
waxed
angry
and
accused
him
of
laughing
at
her
dearest
frau
frohmann
he
said
it
is
so
necessary
you
should
know
the
truth
of
course
you
intend
to
make
a
profit
but
if
you
can
not
do
so
at
your
present
prices
and
yet
will
not
raise
them
at
any
rate
understand
what
it
is
that
you
are
now
the
last
year
had
been
a
bad
year
and
she
knew
that
she
had
not
increased
her
store
this
all
took
place
in
the
month
of
april
when
a
proposition
was
being
made
as
to
the
prices
for
the
coming
season
the
lawyer
had
suggested
that
a
circular
should
be
issued
giving
notice
of
an
altered
tariff
malchen
was
clearly
in
favour
of
the
new
idea
she
could
not
see
that
the
weisses
and
tendels
and
other
neighbours
should
be
entertained
at
a
manifest
loss
and
indeed
she
had
prepossessions
in
favour
of
foreigners
especially
of
the
english
which
when
expressed
brought
down
upon
her
head
sundry
hard
words
from
her
mother
who
called
her
a
pert
hussey
and
implied
that
if
fritz
schlessen
wanted
to
pull
the
house
down
she
malchen
would
be
willing
that
it
should
be
done
better
do
that
mother
than
keep
the
roof
on
at
a
loss
said
malchen
who
upon
that
was
turned
at
once
out
of
the
little
inner
room
in
which
the
conference
was
being
held
peter
who
was
present
on
the
occasion
was
decidedly
opposed
to
all
innovations
partly
because
his
conservative
nature
so
prompted
him
and
partly
because
he
did
not
regard
herr
schlessen
with
a
friendship
so
warm
as
that
entertained
by
his
sister
he
was
perhaps
a
little
jealous
of
the
lawyer
and
then
he
had
an
idea
that
as
things
were
prosperous
to
the
eye
they
would
certainly
come
right
at
last
the
fortunes
of
the
house
had
been
made
at
the
rate
of
six
zwansigers
a
day
and
there
was
he
thought
no
wisdom
more
clear
than
that
of
adhering
to
a
line
of
conduct
which
had
proved
itself
to
be
advantageous
the
kaplan
was
clear
against
any
change
of
prices
but
then
he
burdened
his
advice
on
the
question
with
a
suggestion
which
was
peculiarly
disagreeable
to
the
frau
he
acknowledged
the
truth
of
much
that
the
lawyer
had
said
it
appeared
to
him
that
the
good
things
provided
could
not
in
truth
be
sold
at
the
terms
as
they
were
now
fixed
he
was
quite
alive
to
the
fact
that
it
behoved
the
frau
as
a
wise
woman
to
make
a
profit
charity
is
one
thing
and
business
is
another
the
frau
did
her
charities
like
a
christian
generally
using
father
conolin
as
her
almoner
in
such
matters
but
as
a
keeper
of
a
house
of
public
entertainment
it
was
necessary
that
she
should
live
the
kaplan
was
as
wide
awake
to
this
as
was
the
frau
herself
or
the
lawyer
but
he
thought
that
the
changes
should
not
be
in
the
direction
indicated
by
schlessen
the
condition
of
the
weisses
and
of
the
tendels
should
be
considered
how
would
it
be
if
one
of
the
meats
and
one
of
the
puddings
were
discontinued
and
if
the
cup
of
coffee
after
dinner
were
made
an
extra
would
not
that
so
reduce
the
expenditure
as
to
leave
a
profit
and
in
that
case
the
weisses
and
the
tendels
need
not
necessarily
incur
any
increased
charges
when
the
kaplan
had
spoken
the
lawyer
looked
closely
into
the
frau
s
face
the
proposition
might
no
doubt
for
the
present
meet
the
difficulty
but
he
knew
that
it
would
be
disagreeable
there
came
a
cloud
upon
the
old
woman
s
brow
and
she
frowned
even
upon
the
priest
they
d
want
to
be
helped
twice
out
of
the
one
pudding
and
you
d
gain
nothing
said
peter
according
to
that
said
the
lawyer
if
there
were
only
one
course
the
dinner
would
cost
the
same
the
fewer
the
dishes
the
less
the
cost
no
i
don
t
believe
you
know
anything
about
it
said
the
frau
perhaps
not
said
the
lawyer
on
those
little
details
no
doubt
you
are
the
best
judge
but
i
think
i
have
shown
that
something
should
be
you
might
try
the
coffee
frau
frohmann
said
the
priest
they
would
not
take
any
you
d
only
save
the
coffee
said
the
lawyer
and
the
sugar
said
the
priest
but
then
they
d
never
ask
for
brandy
suggested
peter
the
frau
on
that
occasion
said
not
a
word
further
but
after
a
little
while
got
up
from
her
chair
and
stood
silent
among
them
which
was
known
to
be
a
sign
that
the
conference
was
dismissed
all
this
had
taken
place
immediately
after
dinner
which
at
this
period
of
the
year
was
eaten
at
noon
it
had
simply
been
a
family
meal
at
which
the
frau
had
sat
with
her
two
children
and
her
two
friends
the
kaplan
on
such
occasions
was
always
free
nothing
that
he
had
in
that
house
ever
cost
him
a
kreutzer
but
the
attorney
paid
his
way
like
any
one
else
when
called
on
for
absolute
work
done
not
exactly
for
advice
given
in
conference
he
made
his
charges
it
might
be
that
a
time
was
coming
in
which
no
money
would
pass
on
either
side
but
that
time
had
not
arrived
as
yet
as
soon
as
the
frau
was
left
alone
she
reseated
herself
in
her
accustomed
and
set
herself
to
work
in
sober
and
almost
solemn
sadness
to
think
over
it
all
it
was
a
most
perplexing
question
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
all
the
wealth
which
she
at
present
owned
had
been
made
by
a
business
carried
on
at
the
present
prices
and
after
the
existing
fashion
why
should
there
be
any
change
she
was
told
that
she
must
make
her
customers
pay
more
because
she
herself
was
made
to
pay
more
but
why
should
she
pay
more
she
could
understand
that
in
the
general
prosperity
of
the
brunnenthal
those
about
her
should
have
somewhat
higher
wages
as
she
had
prospered
why
should
not
they
also
prosper
the
servants
of
the
poor
must
she
thought
be
poorer
than
the
servants
of
the
rich
but
why
should
poultry
be
dearer
and
meat
some
things
she
knew
were
cheaper
as
tea
and
sugar
and
coffee
she
had
bought
three
horses
during
the
winter
and
they
certainly
had
been
costly
her
father
had
not
given
such
prices
nor
before
this
had
she
but
that
probably
had
been
peter
s
fault
who
had
too
rashly
acceded
to
the
demands
made
upon
him
and
now
she
remembered
with
regret
that
on
the
of
january
she
had
acceded
to
a
petition
from
the
carpenter
for
an
addition
of
six
zwansigers
to
his
monthly
wages
he
had
made
the
request
on
the
plea
of
a
sixth
child
adding
also
that
journeymen
carpenters
both
at
brixen
and
at
innsbruck
were
getting
what
he
asked
she
had
granted
to
the
coming
of
the
additional
baby
that
which
she
would
probably
have
denied
to
the
other
argument
but
it
had
never
occurred
to
her
that
she
was
really
paying
the
additional
four
shillings
a
month
because
carpenters
were
becoming
dearer
throughout
the
world
malchen
s
clothes
were
certainly
much
more
costly
than
her
own
had
been
when
she
was
young
but
then
malchen
was
a
foolish
girl
fond
of
fashion
from
munich
and
just
at
this
moment
was
in
love
it
could
hardly
be
right
that
those
poor
tendel
females
with
their
small
and
fixed
means
should
be
made
to
pay
more
for
their
necessary
summer
excursions
because
malchen
would
dress
herself
in
french
finery
instead
of
adhering
as
she
ought
to
tyrolese
customs
the
frau
on
this
occasion
spent
an
hour
in
solitude
thinking
over
it
all
she
had
dismissed
the
conference
but
that
could
not
be
regarded
as
an
end
to
the
matter
herr
schlessen
had
come
out
from
innsbruck
with
a
written
document
in
his
pocket
which
he
was
proposing
to
have
printed
and
circulated
and
which
if
printed
and
circulated
would
intimate
to
the
world
at
large
that
the
frau
frohmann
had
raised
her
prices
therein
the
new
rates
seven
zwansigers
and
a
half
a
head
were
inserted
unblushingly
at
full
length
as
though
such
a
disruption
of
old
laws
was
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
there
was
a
flippancy
about
it
which
disgusted
the
old
woman
malchen
seemed
to
regard
an
act
which
would
banish
from
the
peacock
the
old
friends
and
customers
of
the
house
as
though
it
were
an
easy
trifle
and
almost
desirable
with
that
very
object
the
frau
s
heart
warmed
to
the
faces
as
she
thought
of
this
would
she
not
have
infinitely
greater
satisfaction
in
cooking
good
dinners
for
her
simple
tyrolese
neighbours
than
for
rich
foreigners
who
after
all
were
too
often
indifferent
to
what
was
done
for
them
by
those
tendel
ladies
her
puddings
were
recognised
as
real
works
of
art
they
thought
of
them
talked
of
them
ate
them
and
no
doubt
dreamed
of
them
and
herr
weiss
how
he
enjoyed
her
dinners
and
how
proud
he
always
was
as
he
encouraged
his
children
around
him
to
help
themselves
to
every
dish
in
succession
and
the
frau
weiss
with
all
her
cares
and
her
narrow
means
was
she
to
be
deprived
of
that
cheap
month
s
holiday
which
was
so
necessary
for
her
in
order
that
the
peacock
and
the
charms
of
the
brunnenthal
generally
might
be
devoted
to
jews
from
frankfort
or
rich
shopkeepers
from
hamburg
or
worse
still
to
proud
and
thankless
englishmen
at
the
end
of
the
hour
the
frau
had
determined
that
she
would
not
raise
her
prices
but
yet
something
must
be
done
had
she
resolved
even
silently
resolved
that
she
would
carry
on
her
business
at
a
loss
she
would
have
felt
that
she
was
worthy
of
restraint
as
a
lunatic
to
keep
a
house
of
public
entertainment
and
to
lose
by
it
was
to
her
mind
a
very
sad
idea
to
work
and
be
out
of
pocket
by
working
to
her
who
knew
little
or
nothing
of
modern
speculation
such
a
catastrophe
was
most
melancholy
but
to
work
with
the
intention
of
losing
could
be
the
condition
only
of
a
lunatic
and
schlessen
had
made
good
his
point
as
to
the
last
season
the
money
spent
had
been
absolutely
more
than
the
money
received
something
must
be
done
and
yet
she
would
not
raise
her
prices
then
she
considered
the
priest
s
proposition
peter
she
knew
had
shown
himself
to
be
a
fool
though
his
feelings
were
good
he
always
was
a
fool
the
expenses
of
the
house
no
doubt
might
be
much
diminished
in
the
manner
suggested
by
herr
conolin
salt
butter
could
be
given
instead
of
fresh
at
breakfast
cheaper
coffee
could
be
procured
the
courses
at
dinner
might
be
reduced
the
second
pudding
might
be
discontinued
with
economical
results
but
had
not
her
success
in
these
things
been
the
pride
of
her
life
and
of
what
good
would
her
life
be
to
her
if
its
pride
were
crushed
the
weisses
no
doubt
would
come
all
the
same
but
how
would
they
whisper
and
talk
of
her
among
themselves
when
they
found
these
parsimonious
changes
the
tendel
ladies
would
not
complain
it
was
not
likely
that
a
breath
of
complaint
would
ever
pass
their
humble
lips
but
she
herself
she
frau
frohmann
who
was
perhaps
somewhat
unduly
proud
of
her
character
for
wealth
would
have
to
explain
to
them
why
it
was
that
that
second
pudding
had
been
abolished
she
would
be
forced
to
declare
that
she
could
no
longer
afford
to
supply
it
a
declaration
which
to
her
would
have
in
it
something
of
meanness
something
of
degradation
no
she
could
not
abandon
the
glory
of
her
dinner
it
was
as
though
you
should
ask
a
royal
academician
to
cease
to
exhibit
his
pictures
or
an
actor
to
consent
to
have
his
name
withdrawn
from
the
bills
thus
at
last
she
came
to
that
further
resolve
the
kaplan
s
advice
must
be
rejected
as
must
that
of
the
lawyer
but
something
must
be
done
for
a
moment
there
came
upon
her
a
sad
idea
that
she
would
leave
the
whole
thing
to
others
and
retire
into
obscurity
at
schwatz
the
village
from
whence
the
frohmanns
had
originally
come
there
would
be
ample
means
for
private
comfort
but
then
who
would
carry
on
the
peacock
who
would
look
after
the
farm
and
the
timber
and
the
posting
and
the
mill
peter
was
certainly
not
efficient
for
all
that
and
malchen
s
ambition
lay
elsewhere
there
was
too
a
cowardice
in
this
idea
of
running
away
which
was
very
displeasing
to
her
why
need
there
be
any
raising
of
prices
at
all
either
in
one
direction
or
in
the
other
had
she
herself
never
been
persuaded
into
paying
more
to
others
then
she
would
not
have
been
driven
to
demand
more
from
others
and
those
higher
payments
on
her
part
had
she
thought
not
been
obligatory
on
her
she
had
been
soft
and
and
therefore
it
was
that
she
was
now
called
upon
to
be
exorbitant
there
was
something
abominable
to
her
in
this
general
greed
of
the
world
for
more
money
at
the
moment
she
felt
almost
a
hatred
for
poor
seppel
the
carpenter
and
regarded
that
new
baby
of
his
as
an
impertinent
intrusion
she
would
fall
back
upon
the
old
wages
the
old
prices
for
everything
there
would
be
a
difficulty
with
that
innsbruck
butcher
but
unless
he
would
give
way
she
would
try
the
man
at
brixen
in
that
matter
of
fowls
she
would
not
yield
a
kreutzer
to
the
entreaties
of
her
poor
neighbours
who
brought
them
to
her
for
sale
then
she
walked
forth
from
the
house
to
a
little
arbour
or
which
was
close
to
the
chapel
opposite
in
which
she
found
schlessen
smoking
his
pipe
with
a
cup
of
coffee
before
him
and
malchen
by
his
side
i
have
made
up
my
mind
herr
schlessen
she
said
it
was
only
when
she
was
very
angry
with
him
that
she
called
him
herr
schlessen
and
what
shall
i
do
asked
the
lawyer
do
nothing
at
all
but
just
destroy
that
bit
of
so
saying
the
frau
walked
back
to
the
house
and
fritz
schlessen
looking
round
at
malchen
did
destroy
that
bit
of
paper
chapter
iii
the
question
of
the
mitgift
about
two
months
after
the
events
described
in
the
last
chapter
malchen
and
fritz
schlessen
were
sitting
in
the
same
little
arbour
and
he
was
again
smoking
his
pipe
and
again
drinking
his
coffee
and
they
were
again
alone
when
these
two
were
seated
together
in
the
arbour
at
this
early
period
of
the
season
they
were
usually
left
alone
as
they
were
known
to
be
lovers
by
the
guests
who
would
then
be
assembled
at
the
peacock
when
the
summer
had
grown
into
autumn
and
the
strangers
from
a
distance
had
come
and
the
place
was
crowded
then
the
ordinary
and
smokers
would
crowd
round
the
arbour
regardless
of
the
loves
of
amalia
and
fritz
the
whole
family
of
the
weisses
were
now
at
the
peacock
and
the
two
tendel
ladies
and
three
or
four
others
men
with
their
wives
and
daughters
from
botzen
brunecken
and
places
around
at
no
great
distance
it
was
now
the
end
of
june
but
it
is
not
till
july
that
the
house
becomes
full
and
it
is
in
august
that
the
real
crowd
is
gathered
at
frau
frohmann
s
board
it
is
then
that
folk
from
a
distance
can
not
find
beds
and
the
whole
culinary
resources
of
the
establishment
are
put
to
their
greatest
stress
it
was
now
monday
and
the
lawyer
had
been
making
a
holiday
having
come
to
the
brunnenthal
on
the
previous
saturday
on
the
sunday
there
had
been
perhaps
a
dozen
visitors
from
innsbruck
who
had
been
driven
out
after
early
mass
for
their
dinner
and
sunday
holiday
everything
had
been
done
at
the
peacock
on
the
old
style
there
had
been
no
diminution
either
in
the
number
or
in
the
excellence
of
the
dishes
nor
had
there
been
any
increase
in
the
tariff
it
had
been
the
first
day
of
the
season
at
which
there
had
been
a
full
table
and
the
frau
had
done
her
best
everybody
had
known
that
the
sojourners
in
the
house
were
to
be
entertained
at
the
old
rates
but
it
had
been
hoped
by
the
lawyer
and
the
priest
and
by
malchen
even
by
peter
himself
that
a
zwansiger
would
be
added
to
the
charge
for
dinner
demanded
from
the
townspeople
but
at
the
last
moment
word
had
gone
forth
that
there
should
be
no
increase
all
the
morning
the
old
lady
had
been
very
gloomy
she
had
heard
mass
in
her
own
chapel
and
had
then
made
herself
very
busy
in
the
kitchen
she
had
spoken
no
word
to
any
one
till
at
the
moment
before
dinner
she
gave
her
instructions
to
malchen
who
always
made
out
the
bills
and
saw
that
the
money
was
duly
received
there
was
to
be
no
increase
then
when
the
last
pudding
had
been
sent
in
she
went
according
to
her
custom
to
her
room
and
decorated
herself
in
her
grand
costume
when
the
guests
had
left
the
and
were
clustering
about
in
the
passages
and
on
the
seats
in
front
of
the
house
waiting
for
their
coffee
she
had
come
forth
very
fine
with
her
grand
cap
on
her
head
with
her
gold
and
silver
ornaments
with
her
arms
bare
and
radiant
with
smiles
she
shook
madame
weiss
very
graciously
by
the
hand
and
stooped
down
and
kissed
the
youngest
child
to
one
fraulein
after
another
she
said
a
civil
word
and
when
as
it
happened
seppel
the
carpenter
went
by
dressed
in
his
sunday
best
with
a
child
in
each
hand
she
stopped
him
and
asked
kindly
after
the
baby
she
had
made
up
her
mind
that
at
any
rate
for
a
time
she
would
not
submit
to
the
humiliation
of
acknowledging
that
she
was
driven
to
the
necessity
of
asking
increased
prices
that
had
taken
place
on
the
sunday
and
it
was
on
the
following
day
that
the
two
lovers
were
in
the
arbour
together
now
it
must
be
understood
that
all
the
world
knew
that
these
lovers
were
lovers
and
that
all
the
world
presumed
that
they
were
to
become
husband
and
wife
there
was
not
and
never
had
been
the
least
secrecy
about
it
malchen
was
four
or
five
and
twenty
and
he
was
perhaps
thirty
they
knew
their
own
minds
and
were
neither
of
them
likely
to
be
persuaded
by
others
either
to
marry
or
not
to
marry
the
frau
had
given
her
consent
not
with
that
ecstacy
of
joy
with
which
are
sometimes
welcomed
but
still
without
reserve
the
kaplan
had
given
in
his
adhesion
the
young
lawyer
was
not
quite
the
man
he
liked
entertained
some
of
the
new
ideas
about
religion
and
was
given
to
innovations
but
he
was
respectable
and
he
was
a
lover
against
whom
he
as
a
friend
of
the
family
could
not
lift
up
his
voice
peter
did
not
like
the
man
and
peter
in
his
way
was
fond
of
his
sister
but
he
had
not
objected
had
he
done
so
it
would
not
have
mattered
much
malchen
was
stronger
at
the
brunnenthal
than
peter
thus
it
may
be
said
that
things
generally
smiled
upon
the
lovers
but
yet
no
one
had
ever
heard
that
a
day
was
fixed
for
their
marriage
madame
weiss
had
once
asked
malchen
and
malchen
had
told
her
not
exactly
to
mind
her
own
business
but
that
had
been
very
nearly
the
meaning
of
what
she
had
said
there
was
indeed
a
difficulty
and
this
was
the
difficulty
the
frau
had
assented
in
a
gradual
fashion
rather
by
not
dissenting
as
the
thing
had
gone
on
so
that
it
had
come
to
be
understood
that
the
thing
was
to
be
but
she
had
never
said
a
word
as
to
the
young
lady
s
fortune
as
to
that
mitgift
which
in
such
a
case
would
certainly
be
necessary
such
a
woman
as
the
frau
in
giving
her
daughter
would
surely
have
to
give
something
with
her
but
the
frau
was
a
woman
who
did
not
like
parting
with
her
money
and
was
such
a
woman
that
even
the
lawyer
did
not
like
asking
the
question
the
fraulein
had
once
inquired
but
the
mother
had
merely
raised
her
eyebrows
and
remained
silent
then
the
lawyer
had
told
the
priest
that
in
the
performance
of
her
moral
duties
the
frau
ought
to
settle
something
in
her
own
mind
the
priest
had
assented
but
had
seemed
to
imply
that
in
the
performance
of
such
a
duty
an
old
lady
ought
not
to
be
hurried
a
year
or
two
he
seemed
to
think
would
not
be
too
much
for
consideration
and
so
the
matter
stood
at
the
present
moment
perhaps
it
is
that
the
germans
are
a
slow
people
it
may
be
that
the
tyrolese
are
especially
so
be
that
as
it
may
herr
schlessen
did
not
seem
to
be
driven
into
any
agony
of
despair
by
these
delays
he
was
fondly
attached
to
his
malchen
but
as
to
offering
to
take
her
without
any
mitgift
quite
just
as
she
stood
that
was
out
of
the
question
no
young
man
who
had
anything
ever
among
his
acquaintances
did
that
kind
of
thing
scales
should
be
somewhat
equally
balanced
he
had
a
good
income
and
was
entitled
to
some
substantial
mitgift
he
was
quite
ready
to
marry
her
if
only
this
important
question
could
get
itself
settled
malchen
was
quite
as
well
aware
as
was
he
that
her
mother
should
be
brought
to
do
her
duty
in
this
matter
but
perhaps
of
the
two
she
was
a
little
the
more
impatient
if
there
should
at
last
be
a
slip
between
the
cup
and
the
lip
the
effect
to
her
would
be
so
much
more
disastrous
than
to
him
he
could
very
easily
get
another
wife
young
women
were
as
plenty
as
blackberries
so
the
fraulein
told
herself
but
she
might
find
it
difficult
to
suit
herself
if
at
last
this
affair
were
to
be
broken
off
she
knew
herself
to
be
a
fair
upstanding
lass
with
personal
attractions
sufficient
to
make
such
a
young
man
as
fritz
schlessen
like
her
society
but
she
knew
also
that
her
good
looks
such
as
they
were
would
not
be
improved
by
fretting
it
might
be
possible
that
fritz
should
change
his
mind
some
day
if
he
were
kept
waiting
till
he
saw
her
becoming
day
by
day
more
commonplace
under
his
eyes
malchen
had
good
sense
enough
not
to
overrate
her
own
charms
and
she
knew
the
world
well
enough
to
be
aware
that
she
would
be
wise
to
secure
if
possible
a
comfortable
home
while
she
was
at
her
best
it
was
not
that
she
suspected
fritz
but
she
did
not
think
that
she
would
be
justified
in
supposing
him
to
be
more
angelic
than
other
young
men
simply
because
he
was
her
lover
therefore
malchen
was
impatient
and
for
the
last
month
or
two
had
been
making
up
her
mind
to
be
very
round
with
her
mother
on
the
subject
at
the
present
moment
however
the
lovers
as
they
were
sitting
in
the
arbour
were
discussing
rather
the
frau
s
affairs
in
regard
to
the
establishment
than
their
own
schlessen
had
in
truth
come
to
the
brunnenthal
on
this
present
occasion
to
see
what
would
be
done
thinking
that
if
the
thin
edge
of
the
wedge
could
have
been
got
in
if
those
people
from
the
town
could
have
been
made
to
pay
an
extra
zwansiger
each
for
their
sunday
dinner
then
even
yet
the
old
lady
might
be
induced
to
raise
her
prices
in
regard
to
the
autumn
and
more
fashionable
visitors
but
she
had
been
obstinate
and
had
gloried
in
her
obstinacy
dressing
herself
up
in
her
grandest
ornaments
and
smiling
her
best
smiles
as
in
triumph
at
her
own
victory
the
fact
is
you
know
it
won
t
do
said
the
lawyer
to
his
love
i
don
t
know
how
i
am
to
say
any
more
but
anybody
can
see
with
half
an
eye
that
she
will
simply
go
on
losing
money
year
after
year
it
is
all
very
fine
for
the
weisses
and
tendels
and
very
fine
for
old
trauss
old
trauss
was
a
retired
from
vienna
who
lived
at
innsbruck
and
was
accustomed
to
eat
many
dinners
at
the
peacock
a
man
who
could
afford
to
pay
a
proper
price
but
who
was
well
pleased
to
get
a
good
dinner
at
a
cheap
rate
and
very
well
for
old
trauss
continued
the
lawyer
becoming
more
energetic
as
he
went
on
to
regale
themselves
at
your
mother
s
expense
but
that
s
what
it
comes
to
everybody
knows
that
everybody
has
raised
the
price
of
everything
look
at
the
golden
the
golden
lion
was
the
grand
hotel
in
the
town
do
you
think
they
haven
t
raised
their
prices
during
the
last
twenty
years
why
is
it
fritz
everything
goes
up
together
of
course
if
you
ll
look
into
old
accounts
you
ll
see
that
three
hundred
years
ago
you
could
buy
a
sheep
at
salzburg
for
two
florins
and
a
half
i
saw
it
somewhere
in
a
book
if
a
lawyer
s
clerk
then
had
eighty
florins
a
year
he
was
well
off
that
would
not
surprise
her
she
can
understand
that
there
should
be
an
enormous
change
in
three
hundred
years
but
she
can
t
make
out
why
there
should
be
a
little
change
in
thirty
but
many
things
have
got
cheaper
living
altogether
hasn
t
got
cheaper
look
at
wages
i
don
t
know
why
we
should
pay
more
everybody
says
that
bread
is
lower
than
it
used
to
what
sort
of
bread
do
the
people
eat
now
look
at
that
the
man
was
seppel
who
was
dragging
a
cart
which
he
had
just
mended
out
of
the
shed
which
was
close
by
in
which
cart
were
seated
his
three
eldest
children
so
that
he
might
help
their
mother
as
assistant
nurse
even
while
he
was
at
his
work
don
t
you
think
he
gets
more
wheaten
flour
into
his
house
in
a
week
than
his
grandfather
did
in
a
year
his
grandfather
never
saw
white
why
should
he
have
it
because
he
likes
it
and
because
he
can
get
it
do
you
think
he
d
have
stayed
here
if
his
wages
had
not
been
raised
i
don
t
think
seppel
ever
would
have
moved
out
of
the
brunnenthal
then
seppel
would
have
been
more
stupid
than
the
cow
which
knows
very
well
on
which
side
of
the
field
it
can
find
the
best
grass
everything
gets
dearer
and
if
one
wants
to
live
one
has
to
swim
with
the
stream
you
might
as
well
try
to
fight
with
bows
and
arrows
or
with
the
flint
rifles
as
to
live
at
the
same
rate
as
your
the
young
lawyer
as
he
said
this
rapped
his
pipe
on
the
table
to
knock
out
the
ashes
and
threw
himself
back
on
his
seat
with
a
full
conviction
that
he
had
spoken
words
of
wisdom
what
will
it
all
come
to
fritz
this
malchen
asked
with
real
anxiety
in
her
voice
she
was
not
slow
to
join
two
things
together
it
might
well
be
that
her
mother
should
be
induced
by
her
pride
to
carry
on
the
business
for
a
while
so
as
to
lose
some
of
her
money
but
that
she
should
at
last
be
induced
to
see
the
error
of
her
ways
before
serious
damage
had
been
done
her
financial
position
was
too
good
to
be
brought
to
ruin
by
small
losses
but
during
the
period
of
her
discomfiture
she
certainly
would
not
be
got
to
open
her
hand
in
that
matter
of
the
mitgift
malchen
s
own
little
affair
would
never
get
itself
settled
till
this
other
question
should
have
arranged
itself
satisfactorily
there
could
be
no
mitgift
from
a
failing
business
and
if
the
business
were
to
continue
to
fail
for
the
next
year
or
two
where
would
malchen
be
then
it
was
not
therefore
wonderful
that
she
should
be
in
earnest
your
mother
is
a
very
clever
woman
said
the
lover
it
seems
to
me
that
she
is
very
foolish
about
this
said
malchen
whose
feeling
of
filial
reverence
was
not
at
the
moment
very
strong
she
is
a
clever
woman
and
has
done
uncommonly
well
in
the
world
the
place
is
worth
double
as
much
as
when
she
married
your
father
but
it
is
that
very
success
which
makes
her
obstinate
she
thinks
that
she
can
see
her
way
she
fancies
that
she
can
compel
people
to
work
for
her
and
deal
with
her
at
the
old
prices
it
will
take
her
perhaps
a
couple
of
years
to
find
out
that
this
is
wrong
when
she
has
lost
three
or
four
thousand
florins
she
ll
come
fritz
as
he
said
this
seemed
to
be
almost
contented
with
this
view
of
the
case
as
though
it
made
no
difference
to
him
but
with
the
fraulein
the
matter
was
so
essentially
personal
that
she
could
not
allow
it
to
rest
there
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
be
round
with
her
mother
but
it
seemed
to
her
to
be
necessary
also
that
something
should
be
said
to
her
lover
won
t
all
that
be
very
bad
for
you
fritz
her
business
with
me
will
go
on
just
the
this
was
felt
to
be
unkind
and
very
unloverlike
but
she
could
not
afford
at
the
present
moment
to
quarrel
with
him
i
mean
about
our
settling
she
said
it
ought
not
to
make
a
i
don
t
know
about
ought
but
won
t
it
you
don
t
see
her
as
i
do
but
of
course
it
puts
her
into
a
bad
i
suppose
she
means
to
give
you
some
fixed
sum
i
don
t
doubt
but
she
has
it
all
arranged
in
her
own
why
doesn
t
she
name
it
then
ah
my
dear
mein
schatz
there
is
nobody
who
likes
too
well
to
part
with
his
but
when
is
there
to
be
an
end
of
it
you
should
find
that
out
you
are
her
child
and
she
has
only
two
that
she
should
hang
back
is
a
matter
of
course
when
one
has
the
money
of
his
own
one
can
do
anything
it
is
all
in
her
own
hand
see
what
i
bear
when
i
tell
her
this
or
that
she
turns
upon
me
as
if
i
were
nobody
do
you
think
i
should
suffer
it
if
she
were
only
just
a
client
you
must
persuade
her
and
be
gentle
with
her
but
if
she
would
name
the
sum
it
would
be
a
comfort
of
the
fraulein
herself
did
not
in
the
least
know
what
the
sum
ought
to
be
but
she
thought
she
did
know
that
it
was
a
matter
which
should
be
arranged
between
her
lover
and
her
parent
what
she
would
have
liked
to
have
told
him
was
this
that
as
there
were
only
two
children
and
as
her
mother
was
at
any
rate
an
honest
woman
he
might
be
sure
that
a
proper
dowry
would
come
at
last
but
she
was
well
aware
that
he
would
think
that
a
mitgift
should
be
a
mitgift
the
bride
should
come
with
it
in
her
hand
so
that
she
might
be
a
comfort
to
her
husband
s
household
schlessen
would
not
be
at
all
willing
to
wait
patiently
for
the
frau
s
death
or
even
for
some
final
settlement
of
her
affairs
when
she
might
make
up
her
mind
to
leave
the
peacock
and
betake
herself
to
schwatz
you
would
not
like
to
ask
her
yourself
she
said
he
was
silent
for
a
while
and
then
he
answered
her
by
another
question
are
you
afraid
of
her
not
afraid
but
she
would
just
tell
me
i
was
impertinent
i
am
not
a
bit
afraid
but
it
would
do
no
good
it
would
be
so
reasonable
for
you
to
do
there
is
just
the
difference
malchen
i
am
afraid
of
she
could
not
bite
no
but
she
might
say
something
sharp
and
then
i
might
answer
her
sharply
and
then
there
might
be
a
quarrel
if
she
were
to
tell
me
that
she
did
not
want
to
see
me
any
more
in
the
brunnenthal
where
should
we
be
then
mein
schatz
if
you
will
take
my
advice
you
will
just
say
a
word
yourself
in
your
softest
sweetest
then
he
got
up
and
made
his
way
across
to
the
stable
where
was
the
horse
which
was
to
take
him
back
to
innsbruck
malchen
was
not
altogether
well
pleased
with
her
lover
but
she
perceived
that
on
the
present
occasion
she
must
perforce
follow
his
advice
chapter
iv
the
frau
returns
to
the
simplicity
of
the
old
days
two
or
three
weeks
went
by
in
the
brunnenthal
without
any
special
occurrence
and
malchen
had
not
as
yet
spoken
to
her
mother
about
her
fortune
the
frau
had
during
this
time
been
in
more
than
ordinary
good
humour
with
her
own
household
july
had
opened
with
lovely
weather
and
the
house
had
become
full
earlier
than
usual
the
frau
liked
to
have
the
house
full
even
though
there
might
be
no
profit
and
therefore
she
was
in
a
good
humour
but
she
had
been
exceptionally
busy
and
was
trying
experiments
in
her
housekeeping
as
to
which
she
was
still
in
hope
that
they
would
carry
her
through
all
her
difficulties
she
had
been
both
to
brixen
on
one
side
of
the
mountain
and
to
innsbruck
on
the
other
and
had
changed
her
butcher
her
old
friend
hoff
at
the
latter
place
had
altogether
declined
to
make
any
reduction
in
his
prices
of
course
they
had
been
raised
within
the
last
five
or
six
years
who
did
not
know
that
that
had
been
the
case
with
butchers
meat
all
the
world
over
as
it
was
he
charged
the
frau
less
than
he
charged
the
people
at
the
golden
lion
so
at
least
he
swore
and
when
she
told
him
that
unless
an
alteration
was
made
she
must
take
her
custom
elsewhere
he
bade
her
go
elsewhere
therefore
she
did
make
a
contract
with
the
butcher
at
brixen
on
lower
terms
and
seemed
to
think
that
she
had
got
over
her
difficulty
but
brixen
was
further
than
innsbruck
and
the
carriage
was
more
costly
it
was
whispered
also
about
the
house
that
the
meat
was
not
equally
good
nobody
however
had
as
yet
dared
to
say
a
word
on
that
subject
to
the
frau
and
she
though
in
the
midst
of
her
new
efforts
she
was
herself
as
is
the
case
with
many
people
while
they
have
faith
in
the
efforts
they
are
making
had
become
the
cause
of
much
unhappiness
among
others
butter
eggs
poultry
honey
fruit
and
vegetables
she
was
in
the
habit
of
buying
from
her
neighbours
and
had
been
so
excellent
a
customer
that
she
was
as
good
as
a
market
to
the
valley
in
general
there
had
usually
been
some
haggling
but
that
i
think
by
such
vendors
is
considered
a
necessary
and
almost
an
agreeable
part
of
the
operation
the
produce
had
been
bought
and
sold
and
the
frau
had
upon
the
whole
been
regarded
as
a
kind
of
providence
to
the
brunnenthal
but
now
there
were
sad
tales
told
at
many
a
cottage
and
small
farmstead
around
the
frau
had
declared
that
she
would
give
no
more
than
three
zwansigers
a
pair
for
chickens
and
had
insisted
on
having
both
butter
and
eggs
at
a
lower
price
than
she
had
paid
last
year
and
she
had
succeeded
after
infinite
clamours
she
had
been
their
one
market
their
providence
and
they
had
no
other
immediate
customers
to
whom
to
betake
themselves
the
eggs
and
the
butter
the
raspberries
and
the
currants
must
be
sold
she
had
been
imperious
and
had
succeeded
for
a
while
but
there
were
deep
murmurs
and
already
a
feeling
was
growing
up
in
favour
of
innsbruck
and
a
market
cart
it
was
very
dreadful
how
were
they
to
pay
their
taxes
how
were
they
to
pay
anything
if
they
were
to
be
crimped
and
curtailed
in
this
way
one
poor
woman
had
already
walked
to
innsbruck
with
three
dozen
eggs
and
had
got
nearly
twice
the
money
which
the
frau
had
offered
the
labour
of
the
walk
had
been
very
hard
upon
her
and
the
economy
of
the
proceeding
generally
may
have
been
doubtful
but
it
had
been
proved
that
the
thing
could
be
done
early
in
july
there
had
come
a
letter
addressed
to
peter
from
an
english
gentleman
who
with
his
wife
and
daughter
had
been
at
the
brunnenthal
on
the
preceding
year
cartwright
had
now
written
to
say
that
the
same
party
would
be
glad
to
come
again
early
in
august
and
had
asked
what
were
the
present
prices
now
the
very
question
seemed
to
imply
a
conviction
on
the
gentleman
s
mind
that
the
prices
would
be
raised
even
peter
when
he
took
the
letter
to
his
mother
thought
that
this
would
be
a
good
opportunity
for
taking
a
step
in
advance
these
were
english
people
and
entitled
to
no
loving
forbearance
the
cartwrights
need
know
nothing
as
to
the
demands
made
on
the
weisses
and
tendels
peter
who
had
always
been
on
his
mother
s
side
peter
who
hated
changes
even
he
suggested
that
he
might
write
back
word
that
seven
zwansigers
and
a
half
was
now
the
tariff
don
t
you
know
i
have
settled
all
that
said
the
old
woman
turning
upon
him
fiercely
then
he
wrote
to
cartwright
to
say
that
the
charge
would
be
six
zwansigers
a
day
as
heretofore
it
was
certainly
a
throwing
away
of
money
cartwright
was
a
briton
and
would
therefore
almost
have
preferred
to
pay
another
zwansiger
or
two
so
at
least
peter
thought
and
he
even
an
englishman
with
his
wife
and
daughter
was
to
be
taken
in
and
entertained
at
a
loss
at
a
loss
unless
indeed
the
frau
could
be
successful
in
her
new
mode
of
keeping
her
house
father
conolin
in
these
days
kept
away
the
complaints
made
by
the
neighbours
around
reached
his
ears
very
sad
complaints
and
he
hardly
knew
how
to
speak
of
them
to
the
frau
it
was
becoming
very
serious
with
him
he
had
counselled
her
against
any
rise
in
her
own
prices
but
had
certainly
not
intended
that
she
should
make
others
lower
that
had
not
been
his
plan
and
now
he
did
not
know
what
advice
to
give
but
the
frau
resolute
in
her
attempt
and
proud
of
her
success
as
far
as
it
had
gone
constantly
adducing
the
conduct
of
these
two
rival
butchers
as
evidence
of
her
own
wisdom
kept
her
ground
like
a
trojan
all
the
old
courses
were
served
and
the
puddings
and
the
fruit
were
at
first
as
copious
as
ever
if
the
meat
was
inferior
in
quality
and
it
could
not
be
so
without
her
knowledge
for
she
had
not
reigned
so
long
in
the
kitchen
of
the
peacock
without
having
become
a
judge
in
such
matters
she
was
willing
to
pass
the
fault
over
for
a
time
she
tried
to
think
that
there
was
not
much
difference
she
almost
tried
to
believe
that
meat
would
do
as
well
as
there
should
at
least
be
no
lack
of
anything
in
the
cookery
and
so
she
toiled
and
struggled
and
was
hopeful
that
she
might
have
her
own
way
and
prove
to
all
her
advisers
that
she
knew
how
to
manage
the
house
better
than
any
of
them
there
was
great
apparent
good
humour
though
she
had
frowned
upon
peter
when
he
had
shown
a
disposition
to
spoil
those
egyptians
the
cartwrights
she
had
only
done
so
in
defence
of
her
own
resolute
purpose
and
soon
returned
to
her
kind
looks
she
was
too
very
civil
to
malchen
omitting
for
the
time
her
usual
gibes
and
jeers
as
to
her
daughter
s
taste
for
french
finery
and
general
rejection
of
tyrolese
customs
and
she
said
nothing
of
the
prolonged
absence
of
her
two
counsellors
the
priest
and
the
lawyer
a
great
struggle
was
going
on
within
her
own
bosom
as
to
which
she
in
these
days
said
not
a
word
to
anybody
one
counsellor
had
told
her
to
raise
her
prices
another
had
advised
her
to
lessen
the
luxuries
supplied
as
both
the
one
proposition
and
the
other
had
gone
against
her
spirit
she
had
looked
about
her
to
find
some
third
way
out
of
her
embarrassments
she
had
found
it
and
the
way
was
one
which
recommended
itself
to
her
own
sense
of
abstract
justice
the
old
prices
should
prevail
in
the
valley
everywhere
she
would
extort
nothing
from
cartwright
but
then
neither
should
her
neighbours
extort
anything
from
her
seppel
s
wife
was
ill
and
she
had
told
him
that
in
consequence
of
that
misfortune
the
increased
wages
should
be
continued
for
three
months
but
that
after
that
she
must
return
to
the
old
rate
in
the
softness
of
her
heart
she
would
have
preferred
to
say
six
months
but
that
in
doing
so
she
would
have
seemed
to
herself
to
have
departed
from
the
necessary
rigour
of
her
new
doctrine
but
when
seppel
stood
before
her
scratching
his
head
a
picture
of
wretchedness
and
doubt
she
was
not
comfortable
in
her
mind
seppel
had
a
dim
idea
of
his
own
rights
and
did
not
like
to
be
told
that
his
extra
zwansigers
came
to
him
from
the
frau
s
charity
to
go
away
from
the
brunnenthal
at
the
end
of
the
summer
to
go
away
at
all
would
be
terrible
to
him
but
to
work
for
less
than
fair
wages
would
that
not
be
more
terrible
of
all
which
the
frau
as
she
looked
at
him
understood
much
and
she
understood
much
also
of
the
discontent
and
almost
despair
which
was
filling
the
minds
of
the
poor
women
all
around
her
all
those
poor
women
were
dear
to
her
it
was
in
her
nature
to
love
those
around
her
and
especially
those
who
were
dependent
on
her
she
knew
the
story
of
every
household
what
children
each
mother
had
reared
and
what
she
had
lost
when
each
had
been
brought
to
affliction
by
a
husband
s
illness
or
a
son
s
misconduct
she
had
never
been
deaf
to
their
troubles
and
though
she
might
have
been
heard
in
violent
discussions
now
with
one
and
now
with
another
as
to
the
selling
value
of
this
or
that
article
she
had
always
been
held
by
them
to
be
a
just
woman
and
a
constant
friend
now
they
were
up
in
arms
against
her
to
the
extreme
grief
of
her
heart
nevertheless
it
was
necessary
that
she
should
support
herself
by
an
outward
appearance
of
tranquillity
so
that
the
world
around
her
might
know
that
she
was
not
troubled
by
doubts
as
to
her
own
conduct
she
had
heard
somewhere
that
no
return
can
be
made
from
evil
to
good
courses
without
temporary
disruptions
and
that
all
lovers
of
justice
are
subject
to
unreasonable
odium
things
had
gone
astray
because
there
had
been
unintentional
lapses
from
justice
she
herself
had
been
the
delinquent
when
she
had
allowed
herself
to
be
talked
into
higher
payments
than
those
which
had
been
common
in
the
valley
in
her
young
days
she
had
not
understood
when
she
made
these
lapses
gradually
how
fatal
would
be
their
result
now
she
understood
and
was
determined
to
plant
her
foot
firmly
down
on
the
old
figures
all
this
evil
had
come
from
a
departure
from
the
old
ways
there
must
be
sorrow
and
trouble
and
perhaps
some
ill
blood
in
this
return
that
going
back
to
simplicity
is
always
so
difficult
but
it
should
be
done
so
she
smiled
and
refused
to
give
more
than
three
zwansigers
a
pair
for
her
chickens
one
old
woman
came
to
her
with
the
express
purpose
of
arguing
it
all
out
suse
krapp
was
the
wife
of
an
old
woodman
who
lived
high
up
above
the
peacock
among
the
pines
in
a
spot
which
could
only
be
reached
by
a
long
and
very
steep
ascent
and
who
being
old
and
having
a
daughter
and
granddaughters
whom
she
could
send
down
with
her
eggs
and
wild
fruit
did
not
very
often
make
her
appearance
in
the
valley
but
she
had
known
the
frau
well
for
many
years
having
been
one
of
those
to
welcome
her
when
she
had
arrived
there
as
a
bride
and
had
always
been
treated
with
exceptional
courtesy
suse
krapp
was
a
woman
who
had
brought
up
a
large
family
and
had
known
troubles
but
she
had
always
been
able
to
speak
her
own
mind
and
when
she
arrived
at
the
house
with
nothing
to
sell
declaring
at
once
her
purpose
of
remonstrating
with
the
frau
the
frau
regarded
her
as
a
delegate
from
the
commercial
females
of
the
valley
generally
and
she
took
the
coming
in
good
part
asking
suse
into
her
own
inner
room
after
sundry
inquiries
on
each
side
respecting
the
children
and
the
guests
and
the
state
of
things
in
the
world
at
large
the
real
question
was
asked
ah
meine
liebe
frau
frohmann
my
very
dear
frohmann
as
one
might
say
here
why
are
you
dealing
with
us
all
in
the
brunnenthal
after
this
hard
fashion
what
do
you
call
a
hard
fashion
suse
only
giving
half
price
for
everything
that
you
buy
why
should
anything
be
cheaper
this
year
than
it
was
last
ah
alas
does
not
everybody
know
that
everything
is
dearer
why
should
anything
be
dearer
suse
the
people
who
come
here
are
not
charged
more
than
they
were
twenty
years
who
can
tell
how
can
an
old
woman
say
it
is
all
very
bad
the
world
i
suppose
is
getting
worse
but
it
is
so
look
at
the
the
taxes
whether
imperial
or
municipal
was
a
matter
on
which
frau
did
not
want
to
speak
she
felt
that
they
were
altogether
beyond
her
reach
no
doubt
there
had
been
a
very
great
increase
in
such
demands
during
her
time
and
it
was
an
increase
against
which
nobody
could
make
any
stand
at
all
but
if
that
was
all
there
had
been
a
rise
in
prices
quite
sufficient
to
answer
that
she
was
willing
to
pay
three
zwansigers
a
pair
for
chickens
and
yet
she
could
remember
when
they
were
to
be
bought
for
a
zwansiger
each
yes
taxes
she
said
they
are
an
evil
which
we
must
all
endure
it
is
no
good
grumbling
at
them
but
we
have
had
the
roads
made
for
this
was
an
unfortunate
admission
for
it
immediately
gave
suse
krapp
an
easy
way
to
her
great
argument
roads
yes
and
they
are
all
saying
that
they
must
make
use
of
them
to
send
the
things
into
market
josephine
bull
took
her
eggs
into
the
city
and
got
two
kreutzers
apiece
for
the
frau
had
already
heard
of
that
journey
and
had
also
heard
that
poor
josephine
bull
had
been
very
much
fatigued
by
her
labours
it
had
afflicted
her
much
both
that
the
poor
woman
should
have
been
driven
to
such
a
task
and
that
such
an
innovation
should
have
been
attempted
she
had
never
loved
innsbruck
dearly
and
now
she
was
beginning
to
hate
the
place
what
good
did
she
get
by
that
suse
none
i
fear
she
had
better
have
given
her
eggs
away
in
the
but
they
will
have
a
do
you
think
a
cart
won
t
cost
money
there
must
be
somebody
to
drive
the
cart
i
on
this
point
the
frau
spoke
feelingly
as
she
was
beginning
to
appreciate
the
inconvenience
of
sending
twice
a
week
all
the
way
to
brixen
for
her
meat
there
was
a
diligence
but
though
the
horses
were
kept
in
her
own
stables
she
had
not
as
yet
been
able
to
come
to
terms
with
the
proprietor
there
is
all
that
to
think
of
certainly
said
suse
but
wouldn
t
you
come
back
meine
liebe
frau
to
the
prices
you
were
paying
last
year
do
you
not
know
that
they
would
sooner
sell
to
you
than
to
any
other
human
being
in
all
the
world
and
they
must
live
by
their
little
earnings
but
the
frau
could
not
be
persuaded
indeed
had
she
allowed
herself
to
be
persuaded
all
her
purpose
would
have
been
brought
to
an
end
of
course
there
must
be
trouble
and
her
refusal
of
such
a
prayer
as
this
was
a
part
of
her
trouble
she
sent
for
a
glass
of
to
mitigate
the
rigour
of
her
denial
and
as
suse
drank
the
cordial
she
endeavoured
to
explain
her
system
there
could
be
no
happiness
no
real
prosperity
in
the
valley
till
they
had
returned
to
their
old
ways
it
makes
me
unhappy
said
the
frau
shaking
her
head
when
i
see
the
girls
making
for
themselves
long
suse
quite
agreed
with
the
frau
as
to
the
long
petticoats
but
as
she
went
she
declared
that
the
butter
and
eggs
must
be
taken
into
innsbruck
and
another
allusion
to
the
cart
was
the
last
word
upon
her
tongue
it
was
on
the
evening
of
that
same
day
that
malchen
unaware
that
her
mother
s
feelings
had
just
then
been
peculiarly
stirred
up
by
an
appeal
from
the
women
of
the
valley
came
at
last
to
the
determination
of
asking
that
something
might
be
settled
as
to
the
mother
she
said
fritz
schlessen
thinks
that
something
should
be
arranged
as
how
i
suppose
he
wants
to
be
if
he
don
t
i
suppose
somebody
else
does
said
the
mother
smiling
well
mother
of
course
it
is
not
pleasant
to
be
as
we
are
now
you
must
feel
that
yourself
fritz
is
a
good
young
man
and
there
is
nothing
about
him
that
i
have
a
right
to
complain
of
but
of
course
like
all
the
rest
of
em
he
expects
some
money
when
he
takes
a
wife
couldn
t
you
tell
him
what
you
mean
to
give
not
at
present
and
why
not
now
it
has
been
going
on
two
nina
cobard
at
schwatz
was
ten
years
before
her
people
would
let
it
come
off
just
at
present
i
am
trying
a
great
experiment
and
i
can
say
nothing
about
money
till
the
season
is
with
this
answer
malchen
was
obliged
to
be
content
and
was
not
slow
in
perceiving
that
it
almost
contained
a
promise
that
the
affairs
should
be
settled
when
the
season
was
over
chapter
a
zwansiger
is
a
zwansiger
in
the
beginning
of
august
the
weisses
and
the
tendels
and
herr
trauss
had
all
left
the
brunnenthal
and
our
friend
frau
frohmann
was
left
with
a
house
full
of
guests
who
were
less
intimately
known
to
her
but
who
not
the
less
demanded
and
received
all
her
care
but
as
those
departed
whom
she
had
taught
herself
to
regard
as
neighbours
and
who
were
therefore
entitled
to
something
warmer
and
more
generous
than
mere
tavern
hospitality
she
began
to
feel
the
hardness
of
her
case
in
having
to
provide
so
sumptuously
for
all
these
strangers
at
a
loss
there
was
a
party
of
americans
in
the
house
who
had
absolutely
made
no
inquiry
whatsoever
as
to
prices
till
they
had
shown
themselves
at
her
door
peter
had
been
very
urgent
with
her
to
mulct
the
americans
who
were
likely
he
thought
to
despise
the
house
merely
because
it
was
cheap
but
she
would
not
give
way
if
the
american
gentleman
should
find
out
the
fact
and
turn
upon
her
and
ask
her
why
he
was
charged
more
than
others
how
would
she
be
able
to
answer
him
she
had
never
yet
been
so
placed
as
not
to
be
able
to
answer
any
complaints
boldly
and
even
indignantly
it
was
hard
upon
her
but
if
the
prices
were
to
be
raised
to
any
they
must
be
raised
to
all
the
whole
valley
now
was
in
a
hubbub
in
the
matter
of
butter
there
had
been
so
great
a
commotion
that
the
frau
had
absolutely
gone
back
to
the
making
of
her
own
a
system
which
had
been
abandoned
at
the
peacock
a
few
years
since
with
the
express
object
of
befriending
the
neighbours
there
had
been
a
dairy
with
all
its
appurtenances
but
it
had
come
to
pass
that
the
women
around
had
got
cows
and
that
the
frau
had
found
that
without
damage
to
herself
she
could
buy
their
supplies
and
in
this
way
her
own
dairy
had
gone
out
of
use
she
had
kept
her
cows
because
there
had
grown
into
use
a
great
drinking
of
milk
at
the
peacock
and
as
the
establishment
had
gradually
increased
the
demand
for
cream
custards
and
such
luxuries
had
of
course
increased
also
now
when
remembering
this
she
conceived
that
she
had
a
peculiar
right
to
receive
submission
as
to
the
price
of
butter
and
yet
found
more
strong
rebellion
here
than
on
any
other
point
she
at
once
took
the
bull
by
the
horns
and
threw
not
only
her
energies
but
herself
bodily
into
the
dairy
it
was
repaired
and
whitewashed
and
scoured
and
supplied
with
all
necessary
furniture
in
so
marvellously
short
a
time
that
the
owners
of
cows
around
could
hardly
believe
their
ears
and
their
eyes
of
course
there
was
a
spending
of
money
but
there
had
never
been
any
slackness
as
to
capital
at
the
peacock
when
good
results
might
be
expected
from
its
expenditure
so
the
dairy
was
set
agoing
but
there
was
annoyance
even
shame
and
to
the
old
woman
s
feeling
almost
disgrace
arising
from
this
as
you
can
not
eat
your
cake
and
have
it
so
neither
can
you
make
your
butter
and
have
your
cream
the
supply
of
new
milk
to
the
was
at
first
curtailed
and
then
altogether
stopped
the
guests
were
not
entitled
to
the
luxury
by
any
contract
and
were
simply
told
that
as
the
butter
was
now
made
at
home
the
milk
was
wanted
for
that
purpose
and
then
there
certainly
was
a
deterioration
in
the
puddings
there
had
hitherto
been
a
rich
plenty
which
was
now
wanting
no
one
complained
but
the
frau
herself
felt
the
falling
off
the
puddings
now
were
such
as
might
be
seen
at
other
places
at
the
golden
lion
for
instance
hitherto
her
puddings
had
been
unrivalled
in
the
tyrol
then
there
had
suddenly
appeared
a
huckster
a
pedlar
an
itinerant
dealer
in
the
valley
who
absolutely
went
round
to
the
old
women
s
houses
and
bought
the
butter
at
the
prices
which
she
had
refused
to
give
and
this
was
a
man
who
had
been
in
her
own
employment
had
been
brought
to
the
valley
by
herself
and
had
once
driven
her
own
horses
and
it
was
reported
to
her
that
this
man
was
simply
an
agent
for
a
certain
tradesman
in
innsbruck
there
was
an
ingratitude
in
all
this
which
nearly
broke
her
heart
it
seemed
to
her
that
those
to
whom
in
their
difficulties
she
had
been
most
kind
were
now
turning
upon
her
in
her
difficulty
and
she
thought
that
there
was
no
longer
left
among
the
people
any
faith
any
feeling
of
decent
economy
any
principle
disregarding
right
or
wrong
they
would
all
go
where
they
could
get
half
a
zwansiger
more
they
knew
what
it
was
she
was
attempting
to
do
for
had
she
not
explained
it
all
to
suse
krapp
and
yet
they
turned
against
her
the
poor
frau
knew
nothing
of
that
great
principle
of
selling
in
the
dearest
market
however
much
the
other
lesson
as
to
buying
in
the
cheapest
had
been
brought
home
to
her
when
a
fixed
price
had
become
fixed
that
she
thought
should
not
be
altered
she
was
demanding
no
more
than
she
had
been
used
to
demand
though
to
do
so
would
have
been
so
easy
but
her
neighbours
those
to
whom
she
had
even
been
most
friendly
refused
to
assist
her
in
her
efforts
to
the
old
and
salutary
simplicity
of
course
when
the
butter
was
taken
into
innsbruck
the
chickens
and
the
eggs
went
with
the
butter
when
she
learned
how
all
this
was
she
sent
for
suse
krapp
and
suse
krapp
again
came
down
to
her
they
mean
then
to
quarrel
with
me
utterly
said
the
frau
with
her
sternest
frown
meine
liebe
frau
frohmann
said
the
old
woman
embracing
the
arm
of
her
ancient
friend
but
they
do
mean
it
what
can
we
do
poor
wretches
we
must
you
lived
well
enough
before
said
the
frau
raising
her
fist
in
the
unpremeditated
eloquence
of
her
indignation
will
it
be
better
for
you
now
to
deal
with
strangers
who
will
rob
you
at
every
turn
will
karl
muntz
the
blackguard
that
he
is
advance
money
to
any
of
you
at
your
need
well
let
it
be
so
i
too
can
deal
with
strangers
but
when
once
i
have
made
arrangements
in
the
town
i
will
not
come
back
to
the
people
of
the
valley
if
we
are
to
be
severed
we
will
be
severed
it
goes
sadly
against
the
grain
with
me
as
i
have
a
heart
in
my
you
have
you
have
my
dearest
frau
as
for
the
cranberries
we
can
do
without
now
it
had
been
the
case
that
suse
krapp
with
her
grandchildren
had
supplied
the
peacock
with
wild
fruits
in
plentiful
abundance
which
wild
fruits
stewed
as
the
frau
knew
how
to
stew
them
had
been
in
great
request
among
the
guests
at
the
brunnenthal
great
bowls
of
cranberries
and
bilberries
had
always
at
this
period
of
the
year
turned
the
frau
s
modest
suppers
into
luxurious
banquets
but
there
must
be
an
end
to
that
now
not
in
any
way
because
the
price
paid
for
the
fruit
was
grudged
but
because
the
quarrel
if
quarrel
there
must
be
should
be
internecine
at
all
points
she
had
loved
them
all
but
if
they
turned
against
her
not
the
less
because
of
her
love
would
she
punish
them
poor
old
suse
wiped
her
eyes
and
took
her
departure
without
any
on
this
occasion
it
all
went
on
from
bad
to
worse
seppel
the
carpenter
gave
her
notice
that
he
would
leave
her
service
at
the
end
of
august
why
at
the
end
of
august
she
asked
remembering
that
she
had
promised
to
give
him
the
higher
rate
of
wages
up
to
a
later
date
than
that
then
seppel
explained
that
as
he
must
do
something
for
himself
that
is
find
another
place
the
sooner
he
did
that
the
better
now
seppel
the
carpenter
was
brother
to
that
anton
who
had
most
wickedly
undertaken
the
huckstering
business
on
the
part
of
karl
muntz
the
dealer
in
innsbruck
and
it
turned
out
that
seppel
was
to
join
him
there
was
an
ingratitude
in
this
which
almost
drove
the
old
woman
frantic
if
any
one
in
the
valley
was
more
bound
to
her
by
kindly
ties
than
another
it
was
seppel
with
his
wife
and
six
children
wages
there
had
been
no
question
of
wages
when
babette
seppel
s
wife
had
been
ill
and
babette
had
always
been
and
when
he
had
chopped
his
own
foot
with
his
own
axe
and
had
gone
into
the
hospital
for
six
weeks
they
had
wanted
nothing
that
he
should
leave
her
for
a
matter
of
six
zwansigers
a
month
and
not
only
leave
her
but
become
her
active
enemy
was
dreadful
to
her
nor
was
her
anger
at
all
modified
when
he
explained
it
all
to
her
as
a
man
and
as
a
carpenter
who
was
bound
to
keep
up
his
own
respect
among
carpenters
he
could
not
allow
himself
to
work
for
less
than
the
ordinary
wages
the
frau
had
been
very
kind
to
him
and
he
and
his
wife
and
children
were
all
grateful
but
she
would
not
therefore
wish
him
this
was
his
argument
she
would
not
on
that
account
require
him
to
work
for
less
than
his
due
seppel
put
his
hand
on
his
heart
and
declared
that
his
honour
was
concerned
as
for
his
brother
s
cart
and
his
huckstery
trade
and
karl
muntz
he
was
simply
lending
a
hand
to
that
till
he
could
get
a
settled
place
as
carpenter
he
was
doing
the
frau
no
harm
if
he
did
not
look
after
the
cart
somebody
else
would
he
was
very
submissive
and
most
anxious
to
avoid
her
anger
but
yet
would
not
admit
that
he
was
doing
wrong
but
she
towered
in
her
wrath
and
would
listen
to
no
reason
it
was
to
her
all
wrong
it
was
innovation
a
spirit
of
change
coming
from
the
source
of
all
evil
bringing
with
it
unkindness
absence
of
charity
ingratitude
it
was
flat
mutiny
and
rebellion
against
their
betters
for
some
weeks
it
seemed
to
the
frau
that
all
the
world
was
going
to
pieces
her
position
was
the
more
painful
because
at
the
time
she
was
without
counsellors
the
kaplan
came
indeed
as
usual
and
was
as
attentive
and
flattering
to
her
as
of
yore
but
he
said
nothing
to
her
about
her
own
affairs
unless
he
was
asked
and
she
did
not
ask
him
knowing
that
he
would
not
give
her
palatable
counsel
the
kaplan
himself
was
not
well
versed
in
political
economy
or
questions
of
money
generally
but
he
had
a
vague
idea
that
the
price
of
a
chicken
ought
to
be
higher
now
than
it
was
thirty
years
ago
then
why
not
also
the
price
of
living
to
the
guests
at
the
peacock
on
that
matter
he
argued
with
himself
that
the
higher
prices
for
the
chickens
had
prevailed
for
some
time
and
that
it
was
at
any
rate
impossible
to
go
back
and
perhaps
the
lawyer
had
been
right
in
recommending
the
frau
to
rush
at
once
to
seven
zwansigers
and
a
half
his
mind
was
vacillating
and
his
ideas
misty
but
he
did
agree
with
suse
krapp
when
she
declared
that
the
poor
people
must
live
he
could
not
therefore
do
the
frau
any
good
by
his
advice
as
for
schlessen
he
had
not
been
at
the
brunnenthal
for
a
month
and
had
told
malchen
in
innsbruck
that
unless
he
were
specially
wanted
he
would
not
go
to
the
peacock
until
something
had
been
settled
as
to
the
mitgift
of
course
she
is
going
to
lose
a
lot
of
money
said
schlessen
anybody
can
see
that
with
half
an
eye
everybody
in
the
town
is
talking
about
it
but
when
i
tell
her
so
she
is
only
angry
with
malchen
of
course
could
give
no
advice
every
step
which
her
mother
took
seemed
to
her
to
be
unwise
of
course
the
old
women
would
do
the
best
they
could
with
their
eggs
the
idea
that
any
one
out
of
gratitude
should
sell
cheaper
to
a
friend
than
to
an
enemy
was
to
her
monstrous
but
when
she
found
that
her
mother
was
determined
to
swim
against
the
stream
to
wound
herself
by
kicking
against
the
pricks
to
set
at
defiance
all
the
common
laws
of
trade
and
that
in
this
way
money
was
to
be
lost
just
at
that
very
epoch
of
her
own
life
in
which
it
was
so
necessary
that
money
should
be
forthcoming
for
her
own
advantage
then
she
became
moody
unhappy
and
silent
what
a
pity
it
was
that
all
this
power
should
be
vested
in
her
mother
s
hands
as
for
peter
he
had
been
altogether
converted
when
he
found
that
a
cart
had
to
be
sent
twice
a
week
to
brixen
and
that
the
very
poultry
which
had
been
carried
from
the
valley
to
the
town
had
to
be
brought
back
from
the
town
to
the
valley
then
his
spirit
of
conservatism
deserted
him
he
went
so
far
as
to
advise
his
mother
to
give
way
i
don
t
see
that
you
do
any
good
by
ruining
yourself
he
said
but
she
turned
at
him
very
fiercely
i
suppose
i
may
do
as
i
like
with
my
own
she
replied
yes
she
could
do
what
she
liked
with
her
own
but
now
it
was
declared
by
all
those
around
her
by
her
neighbours
in
the
valley
and
by
those
in
innsbruck
who
knew
anything
about
her
that
it
was
a
sad
thing
and
a
bad
thing
that
an
old
woman
should
be
left
with
the
power
of
ruining
all
those
who
belonged
to
her
and
that
there
should
be
none
to
restrain
her
and
yet
for
the
last
years
previous
to
this
it
had
been
the
general
opinion
in
these
parts
that
nobody
had
ever
managed
such
a
house
as
well
as
the
frau
frohmann
as
for
being
ruined
schlessen
who
was
really
acquainted
with
her
affairs
knew
better
than
that
she
might
lose
a
large
sum
of
money
but
there
was
no
fear
of
ruin
schlessen
was
inclined
to
think
that
all
this
trouble
would
end
in
the
frau
retiring
to
schwatz
and
that
the
settlement
of
the
mitgift
might
thus
be
accelerated
perhaps
he
and
the
frau
herself
were
the
only
two
persons
who
really
knew
how
well
she
had
thriven
he
was
not
afraid
and
being
naturally
patient
was
quite
willing
to
let
things
take
their
course
the
worst
of
it
to
the
frau
herself
was
that
she
knew
so
well
what
people
were
saying
of
her
she
had
enjoyed
for
many
years
all
that
delight
which
comes
from
success
and
domination
it
had
not
been
merely
nor
even
chiefly
the
feeling
that
money
was
being
made
it
is
not
that
which
mainly
produces
the
comfortable
condition
of
mind
which
attends
success
it
is
the
sense
of
respect
which
it
engenders
the
frau
had
held
her
head
high
and
felt
herself
inferior
to
none
because
she
had
enjoyed
to
the
full
this
conviction
things
had
gone
pleasantly
with
her
nothing
is
so
enfeebling
as
failure
but
she
hitherto
had
never
failed
now
a
new
sensation
had
fallen
upon
her
by
which
at
certain
periods
she
was
almost
prostrated
the
woman
was
so
brave
that
at
her
worst
moments
she
would
betake
herself
to
solitude
and
shed
her
tears
where
no
one
could
see
her
then
she
would
come
out
and
so
carry
herself
that
none
should
guess
how
she
suffered
to
no
ears
did
she
utter
a
word
of
complaint
unless
her
indignation
to
seppel
to
suse
and
the
others
might
be
called
complaining
she
asked
for
no
sympathy
even
to
the
kaplan
she
was
silent
feeling
that
the
kaplan
too
was
against
her
it
was
natural
that
he
should
take
part
with
the
poor
she
was
now
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
driven
alas
to
feel
that
the
poor
were
against
her
the
house
was
still
full
but
there
had
of
late
been
a
great
falling
off
in
the
midday
visitors
it
had
indeed
almost
come
to
pass
that
that
custom
had
died
away
she
told
herself
with
bitter
regret
that
this
was
the
natural
consequence
of
her
deteriorated
dinners
the
brixen
meat
was
not
good
sometimes
she
was
absolutely
without
poultry
and
in
those
matters
of
puddings
cream
and
custards
we
know
what
a
falling
off
there
had
been
i
doubt
however
whether
her
old
friends
had
been
stopped
by
that
cause
it
may
have
been
so
with
herr
trauss
who
in
going
to
brunnenthal
or
elsewhere
cared
for
little
else
but
what
he
might
get
to
eat
and
drink
but
with
most
of
those
concerned
the
feeling
had
been
that
things
were
generally
going
wrong
in
the
valley
and
that
in
existing
circumstances
the
peacock
could
not
be
pleasant
she
at
any
rate
felt
herself
to
be
deserted
and
this
feeling
greatly
aggravated
her
trouble
you
are
having
beautiful
weather
cartwright
said
to
her
one
day
when
in
her
full
costume
she
came
out
among
the
in
the
front
of
the
house
cartwright
spoke
german
and
was
on
friendly
terms
with
the
old
lady
she
was
perhaps
a
little
in
awe
of
him
as
being
a
rich
man
an
englishman
and
one
with
a
white
beard
and
a
general
deportment
of
dignity
the
weather
is
well
enough
sir
she
said
i
never
saw
the
place
all
round
look
more
lovely
i
was
up
at
sustermann
s
this
morning
and
i
and
my
daughter
agreed
that
it
is
the
most
lovely
spot
we
the
is
a
pretty
spot
sir
no
it
seems
to
me
that
the
house
becomes
fuller
and
fuller
every
year
frau
the
house
is
full
enough
sir
perhaps
too
then
she
hesitated
as
though
she
would
say
something
further
but
the
words
were
wanting
to
her
in
which
to
explain
her
difficulties
with
sufficient
clearness
for
the
foreigner
and
she
retreated
therefore
back
into
her
own
domains
he
of
course
had
heard
something
of
the
frau
s
troubles
and
had
been
willing
enough
to
say
a
word
to
her
about
things
in
general
if
the
occasion
arose
but
he
had
felt
that
the
subject
must
be
introduced
by
herself
she
was
too
great
a
potentate
to
have
advice
thrust
upon
her
uninvited
a
few
days
after
this
she
asked
malchen
whether
schlessen
was
ever
coming
out
to
the
brunnenthal
again
this
was
almost
tantamount
to
an
order
for
his
presence
he
will
come
directly
mother
if
you
want
to
see
him
said
malchen
the
frau
would
do
no
more
than
grunt
in
answer
to
this
it
was
too
much
to
expect
that
she
should
say
positively
that
he
must
come
but
malchen
understood
her
and
sent
the
necessary
word
to
innsbruck
on
the
following
day
schlessen
was
at
the
peacock
and
took
a
walk
up
to
the
waterfall
with
malchen
before
he
saw
the
frau
she
won
t
ruin
herself
said
fritz
it
would
take
a
great
deal
to
ruin
her
what
she
is
losing
in
the
house
she
is
making
up
in
the
forests
and
in
the
then
it
won
t
matter
if
it
does
go
on
like
this
it
does
matter
because
it
makes
her
so
fierce
and
unhappy
and
because
the
more
she
is
knocked
about
the
more
obstinate
she
will
get
she
has
only
to
say
the
word
and
all
would
be
right
what
word
asked
malchen
just
to
acknowledge
that
everything
has
got
to
be
per
cent
dearer
than
it
was
years
but
she
does
not
like
paying
more
fritz
that
s
just
the
what
does
it
matter
what
she
pays
i
should
think
it
mattered
a
great
not
in
the
least
what
does
matter
is
whether
she
makes
a
profit
out
of
the
money
she
spends
florins
and
zwansigers
are
but
names
what
you
can
manage
to
eat
and
drink
and
wear
and
what
sort
of
a
house
you
can
live
in
and
whether
you
can
get
other
people
to
do
for
you
what
you
don
t
like
to
do
yourself
that
is
what
you
have
got
to
look
but
fritz
money
is
just
so
but
it
is
no
more
than
money
if
she
could
find
out
suddenly
that
what
she
has
been
thinking
was
a
zwansiger
was
in
truth
only
half
a
zwansiger
then
she
would
not
mind
paying
two
where
she
had
hitherto
paid
one
and
would
charge
two
where
she
now
charges
one
as
a
matter
of
course
that
s
about
the
but
a
zwansiger
is
a
no
not
in
her
sense
a
zwansiger
now
is
not
much
more
than
half
what
it
used
to
be
if
the
change
had
come
all
at
once
she
could
have
understood
it
but
why
is
it
changed
here
schlessen
scratched
his
head
he
was
not
quite
sure
that
he
knew
and
felt
himself
unable
to
explain
clearly
what
he
himself
only
conjectured
dimly
at
any
rate
it
is
so
that
s
what
she
has
got
to
be
made
to
understand
or
else
she
must
give
it
up
and
go
and
live
quietly
in
private
it
ll
come
to
that
that
she
won
t
have
a
servant
about
the
place
if
she
goes
on
like
this
her
own
grandfather
and
grandmother
were
very
good
sort
of
people
but
it
is
useless
to
try
and
live
like
them
you
might
just
as
well
go
back
further
and
give
up
knives
and
forks
and
cups
and
such
was
the
wisdom
of
herr
schlessen
and
when
he
had
spoken
it
he
was
ready
to
go
back
from
the
waterfall
near
which
they
were
seated
to
the
house
but
malchen
thought
that
there
was
another
subject
as
to
which
he
ought
to
have
something
to
say
to
her
it
is
all
very
bad
for
us
isn
t
it
fritz
it
will
come
right
in
time
my
your
darling
i
don
t
think
you
care
for
me
a
as
she
spoke
she
moved
herself
a
little
further
away
from
him
if
you
did
you
would
not
take
it
all
so
what
can
i
do
malchen
she
did
not
quite
know
what
he
could
do
but
she
was
sure
that
when
her
lover
after
a
month
s
absence
got
an
opportunity
of
sitting
with
her
by
a
waterfall
he
should
not
confine
his
conversation
to
a
discussion
on
the
value
of
zwansigers
you
never
seem
to
think
about
anything
except
money
that
is
very
unfair
malchen
it
was
you
asked
me
and
so
i
endeavoured
to
explain
if
you
have
said
all
that
you
ve
got
to
say
i
suppose
we
may
go
back
of
course
malchen
i
wish
she
d
settle
what
she
means
to
do
about
you
we
have
been
engaged
long
perhaps
you
d
like
to
break
it
you
never
knew
me
break
off
anything
that
was
true
she
did
know
him
to
be
a
man
of
a
constant
if
not
of
an
enthusiastic
temperament
and
now
as
he
helped
her
up
from
off
the
rock
and
contrived
to
snatch
a
kiss
in
the
process
she
was
restored
to
her
good
humour
what
s
the
good
of
that
she
said
thumping
him
but
not
with
much
violence
i
did
speak
to
mother
a
little
while
ago
and
asked
her
what
she
meant
to
was
she
angry
no
not
angry
but
she
said
that
everything
must
remain
as
it
is
till
after
the
season
oh
fritz
i
hope
it
won
t
go
on
for
another
winter
i
suppose
she
has
got
the
oh
yes
she
has
got
it
but
as
i
ve
told
you
before
people
who
have
got
money
do
not
like
to
part
with
then
they
returned
to
the
house
and
malchen
thinking
of
it
all
felt
reassured
as
to
her
lover
s
constancy
but
was
more
than
ever
certain
that
though
it
might
be
for
five
years
he
would
never
marry
her
till
the
mitgift
had
been
arranged
shortly
afterwards
he
was
summoned
into
the
frau
s
private
room
and
there
had
an
interview
with
her
alone
but
it
was
very
short
and
as
he
afterwards
explained
to
malchen
she
gave
him
no
opportunity
of
proffering
any
advice
she
had
asked
him
nothing
about
prices
and
had
made
no
allusion
whatever
to
her
troubles
with
her
neighbours
she
said
not
a
word
about
the
butcher
either
at
innsbruck
or
at
brixen
although
they
were
both
at
this
moment
very
much
on
her
mind
nor
did
she
tell
him
anything
of
the
wickedness
of
anton
nor
of
the
ingratitude
of
seppel
she
had
simply
wanted
so
many
hundred
florins
for
a
purpose
as
she
said
and
had
asked
him
how
she
might
get
them
with
the
least
inconvenience
hitherto
the
money
coming
in
which
had
always
gone
into
her
own
hands
had
sufficed
for
her
expenditure
unless
when
some
new
building
was
required
but
now
a
considerable
sum
was
necessary
she
simply
communicated
her
desire
and
said
nothing
of
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
wanted
the
lawyer
told
her
that
she
could
have
the
money
very
easily
at
a
day
s
notice
and
without
any
peculiar
damage
to
her
circumstances
with
that
the
interview
was
over
and
schlessen
was
allowed
to
return
to
his
lady
love
or
to
the
amusements
of
the
peacock
generally
what
did
she
want
of
you
asked
peter
only
a
question
about
i
suppose
it
was
about
business
but
what
is
she
going
to
do
you
ought
to
know
that
i
should
think
at
any
rate
she
told
me
it
is
getting
very
bad
here
said
peter
with
a
peculiarly
gloomy
countenance
i
don
t
know
where
we
are
to
get
anything
soon
we
have
not
milk
enough
and
half
the
time
the
visitors
can
t
have
eggs
if
they
want
them
and
as
for
fowls
they
have
to
be
bought
for
double
what
we
used
to
give
i
wonder
the
folk
here
put
up
with
it
without
it
ll
come
right
after
this
such
a
name
as
the
place
is
getting
said
peter
and
then
i
sometimes
think
it
will
drive
her
distracted
i
told
her
yesterday
we
must
buy
more
cows
and
oh
she
did
look
at
me
chapter
vi
hoff
the
butcher
the
lawyer
returned
to
town
and
on
the
next
day
the
money
was
sent
out
to
the
brunnenthal
frau
frohmann
had
not
winced
when
she
demanded
the
sum
needed
nor
had
she
shown
by
any
contorted
line
in
her
countenance
that
she
was
suffering
when
she
asked
for
it
but
in
truth
the
thing
had
not
been
done
without
great
pain
year
by
year
she
had
always
added
something
to
her
store
either
by
investing
money
or
by
increasing
her
property
in
the
valley
and
it
would
generally
be
at
this
time
of
the
year
that
some
deposit
was
made
but
now
the
stream
which
had
always
run
so
easily
and
so
prosperously
in
one
direction
had
begun
to
flow
backwards
it
was
to
her
as
though
she
were
shedding
her
blood
but
as
other
heroes
have
shed
their
blood
in
causes
that
have
been
dear
to
them
so
would
she
shed
hers
in
this
if
it
were
necessary
that
these
veins
of
her
heart
should
be
opened
she
would
give
them
to
the
knife
she
had
scowled
when
peter
had
told
her
that
more
cows
must
be
bought
but
before
the
week
was
over
the
cows
were
there
and
she
had
given
a
large
order
at
innsbruck
for
poultry
to
be
sent
out
to
her
almost
irrespective
of
price
all
idea
of
profit
was
gone
it
was
pride
now
for
which
she
was
fighting
she
would
not
give
way
at
any
rate
till
the
end
of
this
season
then
then
then
there
had
come
upon
her
mind
an
idea
that
some
deluge
was
about
to
flow
over
her
but
also
an
idea
that
even
among
the
roar
of
the
waters
she
would
hold
her
head
high
and
carry
herself
with
dignity
but
there
had
come
to
her
now
a
very
trouble
of
troubles
a
crushing
blow
a
misfortune
which
could
not
be
got
over
which
could
not
even
be
endured
without
the
knowledge
of
all
those
around
her
it
was
not
only
that
she
must
suffer
but
that
her
sufferings
must
be
exposed
to
all
the
valley
to
all
innsbruck
when
schlessen
was
closeted
with
her
at
that
very
moment
she
had
in
her
pocket
a
letter
from
that
traitorous
butcher
at
brixen
saying
that
after
such
and
such
a
date
he
could
not
continue
to
supply
her
with
meat
at
the
prices
fixed
and
this
was
the
answer
which
the
man
had
sent
to
a
remonstrance
from
her
as
to
the
quality
of
the
article
after
submitting
for
weeks
to
inferior
meat
she
had
told
him
that
there
must
be
some
improvement
and
he
had
replied
by
throwing
her
over
altogether
what
was
she
to
do
of
all
the
blows
which
had
come
to
her
this
was
the
worst
she
must
have
meat
she
could
when
driven
to
it
by
necessity
make
her
own
butter
but
she
could
not
kill
her
own
beef
and
mutton
she
could
send
into
the
town
for
ducks
and
chickens
and
feel
that
in
doing
so
she
was
carrying
out
her
own
project
that
at
any
rate
she
was
encountering
no
public
disgrace
but
now
she
must
own
herself
beaten
and
must
go
back
to
innsbruck
and
there
came
upon
her
dimly
a
conviction
that
she
was
bound
both
by
prudence
and
justice
to
go
back
to
her
old
friend
hoff
she
had
clearly
been
wrong
in
this
matter
of
meat
hoff
had
plainly
told
her
that
she
was
wrong
explaining
to
her
that
he
had
to
give
much
more
for
his
beasts
and
sheep
than
he
did
twenty
years
ago
to
pay
more
wages
to
the
men
who
killed
them
and
cut
them
up
and
also
to
make
a
greater
profit
himself
so
as
to
satisfy
the
increased
needs
of
his
wife
and
daughters
hoff
had
been
outspoken
and
had
never
wavered
for
a
moment
but
he
had
seemed
to
the
frau
to
be
almost
insolent
she
would
have
said
too
independent
when
she
had
threatened
to
take
away
her
custom
he
had
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
had
simply
remarked
that
he
would
endeavour
to
live
without
it
the
words
had
been
spoken
with
perhaps
something
of
a
jeer
and
the
frau
had
left
the
shop
in
wrath
she
had
since
repented
herself
of
this
because
hoff
had
been
an
old
friend
and
had
attended
to
all
her
wishes
with
friendly
care
but
there
had
been
the
quarrel
and
her
custom
had
been
transferred
to
that
wretch
at
brixen
if
it
had
been
simply
a
matter
of
forgiving
and
forgetting
she
could
have
made
it
up
with
hoff
easily
enough
an
hour
after
her
anger
had
shown
itself
but
now
she
must
own
herself
to
have
been
beaten
she
must
confess
that
she
had
been
wrong
it
was
in
that
matter
of
meat
from
that
fallacious
undertaking
made
by
the
traitor
at
brixen
that
she
in
the
first
instance
had
been
led
to
think
that
she
could
triumph
had
she
not
been
convinced
of
the
truth
of
her
own
theory
by
that
success
she
would
not
have
been
led
on
to
quarrel
with
all
her
neighbours
and
to
attempt
to
reduce
seppel
s
wages
but
now
when
this
her
great
foundation
was
taken
away
from
her
she
had
no
ground
on
which
to
stand
she
had
the
misery
of
failure
all
around
her
and
added
to
that
the
growing
feeling
that
in
some
step
of
her
argument
she
must
have
been
wrong
one
should
be
very
sure
of
all
the
steps
before
one
allows
oneself
to
be
guided
in
important
matters
by
one
s
own
theories
but
after
some
ten
days
time
the
supply
of
meat
from
brixen
would
cease
and
something
therefore
must
be
done
the
brixen
traitor
demanded
now
exactly
the
price
which
hoff
had
heretofore
charged
and
then
there
was
the
carriage
that
was
not
to
be
thought
of
she
would
not
conceal
her
failure
from
the
world
by
submission
so
disgraceful
as
that
with
the
brixen
man
she
certainly
would
deal
no
more
she
took
hours
to
think
of
it
and
then
she
made
up
her
mind
that
she
would
herself
go
into
the
town
and
acknowledge
her
mistake
to
hoff
as
to
the
actual
difference
of
price
she
did
not
now
care
very
much
about
it
when
a
deluge
is
coming
one
does
not
fret
oneself
as
to
small
details
of
cost
but
even
when
a
deluge
is
coming
one
s
heart
and
pride
and
perhaps
one
s
courage
may
remain
unchanged
on
a
certain
morning
it
was
known
throughout
the
peacock
at
an
early
hour
that
the
frau
was
going
into
town
that
day
but
breakfast
was
over
before
any
one
was
told
when
and
how
she
was
to
go
such
journeyings
which
were
not
made
very
often
had
always
about
them
something
of
ceremony
on
such
occasions
her
dress
would
be
not
magnificent
as
when
she
was
arrayed
for
festive
occasions
at
home
but
yet
very
carefully
arranged
and
equally
unlike
her
ordinary
habiliments
when
she
was
first
seen
on
this
day
after
her
early
visit
to
the
kitchen
which
was
not
a
affair
she
was
clad
in
what
may
be
called
the
beginnings
or
substratum
of
her
travelling
gear
she
wore
a
very
full
merino
gown
which
came
much
lower
to
the
ground
than
her
usual
dress
and
which
covered
her
up
high
round
the
throat
whenever
this
was
seen
it
was
known
as
a
certainty
that
the
frau
was
going
to
travel
then
there
was
the
question
of
the
carriage
and
the
horses
it
was
generally
peter
s
duty
and
high
privilege
to
drive
her
in
to
town
and
as
peter
seldom
allowed
himself
a
holiday
the
occasion
was
to
him
always
a
welcome
one
it
was
her
custom
to
let
him
know
what
was
to
befall
him
at
any
rate
the
night
before
but
now
not
a
word
had
been
said
after
breakfast
however
a
message
went
out
that
the
carriage
and
horses
would
be
needed
and
peter
prepared
himself
accordingly
i
don
t
think
i
need
take
you
said
the
frau
why
not
me
there
is
no
one
else
to
drive
them
the
men
are
all
then
she
remembered
that
when
last
she
had
dispensed
with
peter
s
services
anton
had
driven
her
that
anton
who
was
now
carrying
the
butter
and
eggs
into
market
she
shook
her
head
and
was
silent
for
a
while
in
her
misery
then
she
asked
whether
the
boy
jacob
could
not
take
her
he
would
not
be
safe
with
those
horses
down
the
mountains
said
peter
at
last
it
was
decided
that
peter
should
go
but
she
yielded
unwillingly
being
very
anxious
that
no
one
in
the
valley
should
be
informed
that
she
was
about
to
visit
hoff
of
course
it
would
be
known
at
last
everybody
about
the
place
would
learn
whence
the
meat
came
but
she
could
not
bear
to
think
that
those
around
her
should
talk
of
her
as
having
been
beaten
in
the
matter
about
ten
they
started
and
on
the
whole
road
to
innsbruck
hardly
a
word
was
spoken
between
the
mother
and
son
she
was
quite
resolved
that
she
would
not
tell
him
whither
she
was
going
and
resolved
also
that
she
would
pay
the
visit
alone
but
of
course
his
curiosity
would
be
excited
if
he
chose
to
follow
her
about
and
watch
her
there
could
be
no
help
for
that
only
he
had
better
not
speak
to
her
on
the
subject
or
she
would
pour
out
upon
him
all
the
vials
of
her
wrath
in
the
town
there
was
a
little
hostel
called
the
black
eagle
kept
by
a
cousin
of
her
late
husband
which
on
these
journeys
she
always
frequented
there
she
and
peter
ate
their
dinner
at
table
they
sat
of
course
close
to
each
other
but
still
not
a
word
was
spoken
as
to
her
business
he
made
no
inquiry
and
when
she
rose
from
the
table
simply
asked
her
whether
there
was
anything
for
him
to
do
i
am
going
alone
to
see
a
friend
she
said
no
doubt
he
was
curious
probably
suspecting
that
hoff
the
butcher
might
be
the
friend
but
he
asked
no
further
question
she
declared
that
she
would
be
ready
to
start
on
the
return
journey
at
four
and
then
she
went
forth
alone
so
great
was
her
perturbation
of
spirit
that
she
did
not
take
the
directest
way
to
the
butcher
s
house
which
was
not
indeed
above
two
hundred
yards
from
the
black
eagle
but
walked
round
slowly
by
the
river
studying
as
she
went
the
words
with
which
she
would
announce
her
purpose
to
the
man
studying
also
by
what
wiles
and
subtlety
she
might
get
the
man
all
to
herself
so
that
no
other
ears
should
hear
her
disgrace
when
she
entered
the
shop
hoff
himself
was
there
conspicuous
with
the
huge
which
hung
from
his
capacious
girdle
as
though
it
were
the
sword
of
his
knighthood
but
with
him
there
was
a
crowd
either
of
loungers
or
customers
in
the
midst
of
whom
he
stood
tall
above
all
the
others
laughing
and
talking
to
our
poor
frau
it
was
terrible
to
be
seen
by
so
many
eyes
in
that
shop
for
had
not
her
quarrel
with
hoff
and
her
dealings
at
brixen
been
so
public
that
all
would
know
why
she
had
come
ah
my
friend
frau
frohmann
said
the
butcher
coming
up
to
her
with
hand
extended
this
is
good
for
sore
eyes
i
am
delighted
to
see
thee
in
the
old
this
was
all
very
well
and
she
gave
him
her
hand
as
long
as
no
public
reference
was
made
to
that
last
visit
of
hers
she
would
still
hold
up
her
head
but
she
said
nothing
she
did
not
know
how
to
speak
as
long
as
all
those
eyes
were
looking
at
her
the
butcher
understood
it
all
being
a
man
and
intelligent
also
from
the
first
moment
of
her
entrance
he
knew
that
there
was
something
to
be
said
intended
only
for
his
own
ears
come
in
come
in
frau
frohmann
he
said
we
will
sit
down
within
out
of
the
noise
of
the
street
and
the
smell
of
the
with
that
he
led
the
way
into
an
inner
room
and
the
frau
followed
him
there
were
congregated
three
or
four
of
his
children
but
he
sent
them
away
bidding
them
join
their
mother
in
the
kitchen
and
now
my
friend
he
said
again
taking
her
hand
i
am
glad
to
see
thee
thirty
years
of
good
fellowship
is
not
to
be
broken
by
a
by
this
time
the
frau
was
endeavouring
to
hide
with
her
handkerchief
the
tears
which
were
running
down
her
face
i
was
thinking
i
would
go
out
to
the
valley
one
of
these
days
because
my
heart
misgave
me
that
there
should
be
anything
like
a
quarrel
between
me
and
thee
i
should
have
gone
but
that
day
after
day
there
comes
always
something
to
be
done
and
now
thou
art
come
thyself
what
shall
the
price
of
a
side
of
beef
stand
betwixt
thee
and
me
then
she
told
her
tale
quite
otherwise
than
as
she
had
intended
to
tell
it
she
had
meant
to
be
dignified
and
very
short
she
had
meant
to
confess
that
the
brixen
arrangement
had
broken
down
and
that
she
would
resort
to
the
old
plan
and
the
old
prices
to
the
saying
of
this
she
had
looked
forward
with
an
agony
of
apprehension
fearing
that
the
man
would
be
unable
to
abstain
from
some
killing
expression
of
triumph
fearing
that
perhaps
he
might
decline
her
offer
for
the
butcher
was
a
wealthy
man
who
could
afford
himself
the
luxury
of
nursing
his
enmity
but
his
manner
with
her
had
been
so
gracious
that
she
was
altogether
unable
to
be
either
dignified
or
reticent
before
half
an
hour
was
over
she
had
poured
out
to
him
with
many
tears
all
her
troubles
how
she
had
refused
to
raise
her
rate
of
charges
first
out
of
consideration
for
her
poorer
customers
and
then
because
she
did
not
like
to
demand
from
one
class
more
than
from
another
and
she
explained
how
she
had
endeavoured
to
reduce
her
expenditure
and
how
she
had
failed
she
told
him
of
seppel
and
anton
of
suse
krapp
and
josephine
bull
and
above
all
of
that
traitor
at
brixen
with
respect
to
the
valley
folk
hoff
expressed
himself
with
magnanimity
and
kindness
but
in
regard
to
the
rival
tradesman
at
brixen
his
scorn
was
so
great
that
he
could
not
restrain
himself
from
expressing
wonder
that
a
woman
of
such
experience
should
have
trusted
to
so
poor
a
reed
for
support
in
all
other
respects
he
heard
her
with
excellent
patience
putting
in
a
little
word
here
and
there
to
encourage
her
running
his
great
steel
all
the
while
through
his
fingers
as
he
sat
opposite
to
her
on
a
side
of
the
table
thou
must
pay
them
for
their
ducks
and
chickens
as
before
he
said
and
you
i
will
make
all
that
straight
do
not
trouble
thyself
about
me
thy
guests
at
the
peacock
shall
once
again
have
a
joint
of
meat
fit
for
the
stomach
of
a
christian
but
my
friend
my
friend
echoed
the
frau
waiting
to
hear
what
further
the
butcher
would
say
to
her
let
a
man
who
has
brought
up
five
sons
and
five
daughters
and
who
has
never
owed
a
florin
which
he
could
not
pay
tell
thee
something
that
shall
be
useful
swim
with
the
she
looked
up
into
his
face
feeling
rather
than
understanding
the
truth
of
what
he
was
saying
swim
with
the
stream
it
is
the
easiest
and
the
most
you
think
i
should
raise
my
is
not
everybody
doing
so
the
tendel
ladies
are
very
good
but
i
can
not
sell
them
meat
at
a
loss
that
is
not
selling
it
is
giving
swim
with
the
stream
when
other
things
are
dearer
let
the
peacock
be
dearer
but
why
are
other
things
dearer
nay
who
shall
say
that
young
schlessen
is
a
lad
and
he
was
right
when
he
told
thee
of
the
price
of
sheep
in
the
old
days
but
why
there
i
can
say
nothing
nor
is
there
reason
why
i
should
trouble
my
head
about
it
there
is
a
man
who
has
brought
me
sheep
from
the
achensee
these
thirty
years
he
and
his
father
before
him
i
have
to
pay
him
now
ay
more
than
a
third
above
his
first
do
you
give
always
what
he
asks
certainly
not
that
or
there
would
be
no
end
to
his
asking
but
we
can
generally
come
to
terms
without
hard
words
when
i
pay
him
more
for
sheep
then
i
charge
more
for
mutton
and
if
people
will
not
pay
it
then
they
must
go
without
but
i
do
sell
my
meat
and
i
live
at
any
rate
as
well
now
as
i
did
when
the
prices
were
then
he
repeated
his
great
advice
swim
with
the
stream
my
friend
swim
with
the
stream
if
you
turn
your
head
the
other
way
the
chances
are
you
will
go
backwards
at
any
rate
you
will
make
no
exactly
at
four
o
clock
she
started
on
her
return
with
her
son
who
with
admirable
discretion
asked
no
question
as
to
her
employment
during
the
day
the
journey
back
took
much
longer
than
that
coming
as
the
road
was
up
hill
all
the
way
so
that
she
had
ample
time
to
think
over
the
advice
which
had
been
given
her
as
she
leaned
back
in
the
carriage
she
certainly
was
happier
in
her
mind
than
she
had
been
in
the
morning
she
had
made
no
step
towards
success
in
her
system
had
rather
been
made
to
feel
that
no
such
step
was
possible
but
nevertheless
she
had
been
comforted
the
immediate
trouble
as
to
the
meat
had
been
got
over
without
offence
to
her
feelings
of
course
she
must
pay
the
old
prices
but
she
had
come
to
understand
that
the
world
around
her
was
in
that
matter
too
strong
for
her
she
knew
now
that
she
must
give
up
the
business
or
else
raise
her
own
terms
at
the
end
of
the
season
she
almost
thought
that
she
would
retire
to
schwatz
and
devote
the
remainder
of
her
days
to
tranquillity
and
religion
but
her
immediate
anxiety
had
reference
to
the
next
six
weeks
so
that
when
she
should
have
gone
to
schwatz
it
might
be
said
of
her
that
the
house
had
not
lost
its
reputation
for
good
living
up
to
the
very
last
at
any
rate
within
a
very
few
days
she
would
again
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
good
meat
roasting
in
her
oven
peter
as
was
his
custom
had
walked
half
the
hill
and
then
while
the
horses
were
slowly
advancing
climbed
up
to
his
seat
on
the
box
peter
she
said
calling
to
him
from
the
open
carriage
behind
then
peter
looked
back
peter
the
meat
is
to
come
from
hoff
again
after
next
he
turned
round
quick
on
hearing
the
words
that
s
a
good
thing
it
is
a
good
thing
we
were
nearly
poisoned
by
that
scoundrel
at
hoff
is
a
good
butcher
said
peter
hoff
is
a
good
man
said
the
frau
then
peter
pricked
up
because
he
knew
that
his
mother
was
happy
in
her
mind
and
became
eloquent
about
the
woods
and
the
quarry
and
the
farm
chapter
vii
and
gold
becomes
cheap
but
if
there
is
more
money
sir
that
ought
to
make
us
all
more
this
was
said
by
the
frau
to
cartwright
a
few
days
after
her
return
from
innsbruck
and
was
a
reply
to
a
statement
made
by
him
she
had
listened
to
advice
from
hoff
the
butcher
and
now
she
was
listening
to
advice
from
her
guest
he
had
told
her
that
these
troubles
of
hers
had
come
from
the
fact
that
gold
had
become
more
plentiful
in
the
world
than
heretofore
or
rather
from
that
other
fact
that
she
had
refused
to
accommodate
herself
to
this
increased
plenty
of
gold
then
had
come
her
very
natural
suggestion
if
there
is
more
money
that
ought
to
make
us
all
more
not
at
all
frau
well
sir
then
she
paused
not
wishing
to
express
an
unrestrained
praise
of
wealth
and
so
to
appear
too
but
yet
feeling
that
he
certainly
was
wrong
according
to
the
clearly
expressed
opinion
of
the
world
not
at
all
though
you
had
your
barn
and
your
stores
filled
with
gold
you
could
not
make
your
guests
comfortable
with
that
they
could
not
eat
it
nor
drink
it
nor
sleep
upon
it
nor
delight
themselves
with
looking
at
it
as
we
do
at
the
waterfall
or
at
the
mill
up
but
i
could
buy
all
those
things
for
ah
if
you
could
buy
them
that
s
just
the
question
but
if
everybody
had
gold
so
common
if
all
the
barns
were
full
of
it
then
people
would
not
care
to
take
it
for
their
meat
and
it
never
can
be
like
that
there
is
no
knowing
probably
not
but
it
is
a
question
of
degree
when
you
have
your
here
very
plentiful
don
t
you
find
that
hay
becomes
cheap
that
s
of
and
gold
becomes
cheap
you
just
think
it
over
and
you
ll
find
how
it
is
when
hay
is
plentiful
you
can
t
get
so
much
for
a
load
because
it
becomes
cheap
but
you
can
feed
more
cows
and
altogether
you
know
that
such
plenty
is
a
blessing
so
it
is
with
gold
when
it
is
plentiful
you
can
t
get
so
much
meat
for
it
as
you
used
to
do
but
as
you
can
get
the
gold
much
easier
it
will
come
to
the
same
thing
if
you
will
swim
with
the
stream
as
your
friend
in
innsbruck
counselled
then
the
frau
again
considered
and
again
found
that
she
could
not
accept
this
doctrine
as
bearing
upon
her
own
case
i
don
t
think
it
can
be
like
that
here
sir
she
said
why
not
here
as
well
as
elsewhere
because
we
never
see
a
bit
of
gold
from
one
year
s
end
to
the
other
barns
full
of
it
why
it
s
so
precious
that
you
english
people
and
the
french
and
the
americans
always
change
it
for
paper
before
you
come
here
if
you
mean
that
it
is
because
are
so
common
then
cartwright
scratched
his
head
feeling
that
there
would
be
a
difficulty
in
making
the
frau
understand
the
increased
use
of
an
article
which
common
as
it
had
become
in
the
great
marts
of
the
world
had
not
as
yet
made
its
way
into
her
valley
it
is
because
are
less
the
frau
gazed
at
him
steadfastly
trying
to
understand
something
about
it
you
still
use
at
innsbruck
nothing
else
she
said
there
is
a
little
silver
among
the
shops
but
you
never
see
a
bit
of
and
at
munich
at
munich
they
tell
me
the
french
pieces
have
become
well
not
common
but
not
so
very
and
at
dresden
i
do
not
know
perhaps
dresden
is
the
and
at
paris
ah
paris
do
they
have
gold
there
when
i
was
young
it
was
all
silver
at
paris
gold
is
now
as
plentiful
as
blackberries
and
at
berlin
it
is
nearly
the
same
just
here
in
austria
you
have
not
quite
got
through
your
i
think
we
are
doing
very
well
in
austria
at
any
rate
in
the
very
well
frau
frohmann
very
well
indeed
pray
do
not
suppose
that
i
mean
anything
to
the
contrary
but
though
you
haven
t
got
into
the
way
of
using
gold
money
yourself
the
world
all
around
you
has
done
so
and
of
course
if
meat
is
dear
at
munich
because
gold
won
t
buy
so
much
there
as
it
used
to
do
meat
will
be
dearer
also
at
innsbruck
even
though
you
continue
to
pay
for
it
with
it
is
dearer
sir
no
doubt
said
the
frau
shaking
her
head
she
had
endeavoured
to
contest
that
point
gallantly
but
had
been
beaten
by
the
conduct
of
the
two
butchers
the
higher
prices
of
hoff
at
innsbruck
had
become
at
any
rate
better
than
the
lower
prices
of
that
deceitful
enemy
at
brixen
it
is
dearer
for
the
world
generally
that
may
suffice
your
friend
s
doctrine
is
quite
enough
for
the
world
at
large
swim
with
the
stream
in
buying
and
selling
what
we
call
trade
things
arrange
themselves
so
subtly
that
we
are
often
driven
to
accept
them
without
quite
knowing
why
they
are
so
then
we
can
only
swim
with
the
stream
but
in
this
matter
if
you
want
to
find
out
the
cause
if
you
can
not
satisfy
your
mind
without
knowing
why
it
is
that
you
must
pay
more
for
everything
and
must
therefore
charge
more
to
other
people
it
is
because
the
gold
which
your
notes
represent
has
become
more
common
in
the
world
during
the
last
thirty
she
did
want
to
know
she
was
not
satisfied
to
swim
with
the
stream
as
hoff
had
done
not
caring
to
inquire
but
simply
feeling
sure
that
as
things
were
so
so
they
must
be
that
such
changes
should
take
place
had
gone
much
against
the
grain
of
her
conservative
nature
she
in
her
own
mind
had
attributed
these
pestilently
increased
expenses
to
elongated
petticoats
french
bonnets
coats
and
a
taste
for
sour
wine
she
had
imagined
that
josephine
bull
might
have
been
contented
with
the
old
price
for
her
eggs
if
she
would
also
be
contented
with
the
old
raiment
and
the
old
food
grounding
her
resolutions
on
that
belief
she
had
endeavoured
not
only
to
resist
further
changes
but
even
to
go
back
to
the
good
old
times
but
she
now
was
quite
aware
that
in
doing
so
she
had
endeavoured
to
swim
against
the
stream
whether
it
ought
to
be
so
or
not
she
was
not
as
yet
quite
sure
but
she
was
becoming
sure
that
such
was
the
fact
and
that
the
fact
was
too
strong
for
her
to
combat
she
did
not
at
all
like
swimming
with
the
stream
there
was
something
conveyed
by
the
idea
which
was
repugnant
to
her
sense
of
honour
did
it
not
mean
that
she
was
to
increase
her
prices
because
other
people
increased
theirs
whether
it
was
wrong
or
right
she
hated
the
doing
of
anything
because
other
people
did
it
was
not
that
base
propensity
to
imitation
the
cause
of
the
long
petticoats
which
all
the
girls
were
wearing
was
it
not
thus
that
all
those
vile
changes
were
effected
which
she
saw
around
her
on
every
side
had
it
not
been
her
glory
her
great
resolve
to
stand
as
fast
as
possible
on
the
old
ways
and
now
in
her
great
attempt
to
do
so
was
she
to
be
foiled
thus
easily
it
was
clear
to
her
that
she
must
be
foiled
if
not
in
one
way
then
in
another
she
must
either
raise
her
prices
or
else
retire
to
schwatz
she
had
been
thoroughly
beaten
in
her
endeavour
to
make
others
carry
on
their
trade
in
accordance
with
her
theories
on
every
side
she
had
been
beaten
there
was
not
a
poor
woman
in
the
valley
not
one
of
those
who
had
wont
to
be
so
submissive
and
gracious
to
her
who
had
not
deserted
her
a
proposed
reduction
of
two
kreutzers
on
a
dozen
of
eggs
had
changed
the
most
constant
of
humble
friends
into
the
bitterest
foes
seppel
would
have
gone
through
fire
and
water
for
her
anything
that
a
man
s
strength
or
courage
could
do
he
would
have
done
but
a
threat
of
going
back
to
the
old
wages
had
conquered
even
seppel
s
gratitude
concurrent
testimony
had
convinced
her
that
she
must
either
yield
or
go
but
when
she
came
to
think
of
it
in
her
solitude
she
did
not
wish
to
go
schwatz
oh
yes
it
would
be
very
well
to
have
a
quiet
place
ready
chosen
for
retirement
when
retirement
should
be
necessary
but
what
did
retirement
mean
would
it
not
be
to
her
simply
a
beginning
of
dying
a
man
or
a
woman
should
retire
when
no
longer
able
to
do
the
work
of
the
world
but
who
in
all
the
world
could
keep
the
brunnenthal
peacock
as
well
as
she
was
she
fatigued
with
her
kitchen
or
worn
out
with
the
charge
of
her
guests
or
worried
inwardly
by
the
anxieties
of
her
position
not
in
the
least
not
at
all
but
for
this
later
misfortune
which
had
come
upon
her
a
misfortune
which
she
knew
how
to
remedy
at
once
if
only
she
could
bring
herself
to
apply
the
remedy
the
kaplan
had
indiscreetly
suggested
to
her
that
as
malchen
was
about
to
marry
and
be
taken
away
into
the
town
it
would
be
a
good
thing
that
peter
should
take
a
wife
so
that
there
might
be
a
future
mistress
of
the
establishment
in
readiness
the
idea
caused
her
to
arm
herself
instantly
with
renewed
so
they
were
already
preparing
for
her
departure
to
schwatz
it
was
thus
she
communed
with
herself
they
had
already
made
up
their
minds
that
she
must
succumb
to
these
difficulties
and
go
the
idea
had
come
simply
from
the
kaplan
without
consultation
with
any
one
but
to
the
frau
it
seemed
as
though
the
whole
valley
were
already
preparing
for
her
departure
no
she
would
not
go
with
her
strength
and
her
energy
why
should
she
shut
herself
up
as
ready
for
death
she
would
not
go
to
schwatz
yet
awhile
but
if
not
then
she
must
raise
her
prices
to
waste
her
substance
to
expend
the
success
of
her
life
in
entertaining
folk
gratis
who
after
all
would
believe
that
they
were
paying
for
their
entertainment
would
be
worse
even
than
going
to
schwatz
i
have
been
thinking
over
what
you
were
telling
me
she
said
to
cartwright
about
a
week
after
their
last
interview
on
the
day
before
his
departure
from
the
valley
i
hope
you
do
not
find
i
was
wrong
frau
as
for
wrong
and
right
that
is
very
difficult
to
get
at
in
this
wicked
but
one
can
acknowledge
a
that
is
where
it
is
sir
one
can
see
what
is
necessary
but
if
one
could
only
see
that
it
were
right
also
one
would
be
so
much
more
there
are
things
so
hard
to
be
seen
my
friend
that
let
us
do
what
we
will
we
can
not
see
clearly
into
the
middle
of
them
perhaps
i
could
have
explained
to
you
better
all
this
about
the
depreciation
of
money
and
the
nominal
rise
in
the
value
of
everything
else
if
i
had
understood
it
better
i
am
sure
you
understand
all
about
it
which
a
poor
woman
can
t
ever
but
this
at
any
rate
ought
to
give
you
confidence
that
that
which
you
purpose
to
do
is
being
done
by
everybody
around
you
you
were
talking
to
me
about
the
weisses
herr
weiss
i
hear
had
his
salary
raised
last
had
he
asked
the
frau
with
energy
and
a
little
start
for
this
piece
of
news
had
not
reached
her
before
somebody
was
saying
so
the
other
day
no
doubt
it
was
found
that
he
must
be
paid
more
because
he
had
to
pay
more
for
everything
he
wanted
therefore
he
ought
to
expect
to
have
to
pay
you
this
piece
of
information
gave
the
frau
more
comfort
than
anything
she
had
yet
heard
that
gold
should
be
common
what
people
call
a
drug
in
the
market
did
not
come
quite
within
the
scope
of
her
comprehension
gold
to
her
was
gold
and
a
zwansiger
a
zwansiger
but
if
herr
weiss
got
more
for
his
services
from
the
community
she
ought
to
get
more
from
him
for
her
services
that
did
seem
plain
to
her
but
then
her
triumph
in
that
direction
was
immediately
diminished
by
a
tender
feeling
as
to
other
customers
but
what
of
those
poor
fraulein
tendels
she
said
ah
yes
said
cartwright
there
you
come
to
fixed
to
what
to
people
with
fixed
incomes
they
must
suffer
frau
frohmann
there
is
an
old
saying
that
in
making
laws
you
can
not
look
after
all
the
little
things
the
people
who
work
and
earn
their
living
are
the
multitude
and
to
them
these
matters
adjust
themselves
the
few
who
live
upon
what
they
have
saved
or
others
have
saved
for
them
must
go
to
the
neither
did
the
frau
understand
this
but
she
at
once
made
up
her
mind
that
however
necessary
it
might
be
to
raise
her
prices
against
the
weisses
and
the
rest
of
the
world
she
would
never
raise
them
against
those
two
poor
desolate
frauleins
so
herr
weiss
had
had
his
salary
raised
and
had
said
nothing
to
her
about
it
no
doubt
prudently
wishing
to
conceal
the
matter
he
had
said
nothing
to
her
about
it
although
he
had
talked
to
her
about
her
own
affairs
and
had
applauded
her
courage
and
her
old
conservatism
in
that
she
would
not
demand
that
extra
zwansiger
and
a
half
this
hardened
her
heart
so
much
that
she
felt
she
would
have
a
pleasure
in
sending
a
circular
to
him
as
to
the
new
tariff
he
might
come
or
let
it
alone
as
he
pleased
certainly
he
ought
to
have
told
her
that
his
own
salary
had
been
increased
but
there
was
more
to
do
than
sending
out
the
new
circular
to
her
customers
how
was
she
to
send
a
circular
round
the
valley
to
the
old
women
and
the
others
concerned
how
was
she
to
make
seppel
and
anton
and
josephine
bull
understand
that
they
should
be
forgiven
and
have
their
old
prices
and
their
increased
wages
if
they
would
come
back
to
their
allegiance
and
never
say
a
word
again
as
to
the
sad
affairs
of
the
past
summer
this
circular
must
be
of
a
nature
very
different
from
that
which
would
serve
for
her
customers
thinking
over
it
she
came
to
the
opinion
that
suse
krapp
would
be
the
best
circular
a
day
or
two
after
the
cartwrights
were
gone
she
sent
for
suse
suse
was
by
no
means
a
bad
diplomate
when
gaining
her
point
she
had
no
desire
to
triumph
outwardly
when
feeling
herself
a
conqueror
she
was
quite
ready
to
flatter
the
conquered
one
she
had
never
been
more
gracious
more
submissive
or
more
ready
to
declare
that
in
all
matters
the
frau
s
will
was
the
law
of
the
valley
than
now
when
she
was
given
to
understand
that
everything
should
be
bought
on
the
same
terms
as
heretofore
that
the
dairy
should
be
discontinued
during
the
next
season
and
that
the
wild
fruits
of
the
woods
and
mountains
should
be
made
welcome
at
the
peacock
as
had
heretofore
always
been
the
case
will
be
the
happiest
day
that
ever
was
in
the
valley
said
suse
in
her
enthusiasm
and
as
for
seppel
he
was
telling
me
only
yesterday
that
he
would
never
be
a
happy
man
again
till
he
could
find
himself
once
more
at
work
in
the
old
shed
behind
the
then
suse
was
told
that
seppel
might
come
as
soon
as
he
pleased
he
ll
be
there
the
morning
after
next
if
i
m
a
living
woman
continued
suse
energetically
and
then
she
said
another
word
oh
meine
liebe
frau
frohmann
it
broke
my
heart
when
they
told
me
you
were
going
going
away
said
the
frau
as
though
she
had
been
stung
who
said
that
i
was
going
away
i
did
hear
psha
it
was
that
stupid
she
had
never
before
been
heard
to
say
a
word
against
the
kaplan
but
now
she
could
hardly
restrain
herself
why
should
i
go
away
no
indeed
i
am
not
thinking
of
going
away
it
would
be
a
bad
thing
if
i
were
to
be
driven
out
of
my
house
by
a
little
trouble
as
to
the
price
of
eggs
and
butter
no
suse
krapp
i
am
not
going
it
will
be
the
best
word
we
have
all
of
us
heard
this
many
a
day
frau
frohmann
when
it
came
to
that
we
were
all
as
though
we
would
have
broken
our
then
she
was
sent
away
upon
her
mission
not
upon
this
occasion
without
a
full
glass
of
on
the
very
day
following
seppel
was
back
there
was
nothing
said
between
him
and
his
mistress
but
he
waited
about
the
front
of
the
house
till
he
had
an
opportunity
of
putting
his
hand
up
to
his
cap
and
smiling
at
her
as
she
stood
upon
the
doorstep
and
then
before
the
week
was
over
all
the
old
women
and
all
the
young
girls
were
crowding
round
the
place
with
little
presents
which
on
this
their
first
return
to
their
allegiance
they
brought
to
the
frau
as
the
season
was
nearly
over
when
she
signified
to
malchen
her
desire
that
fritz
schlessen
should
come
out
to
the
valley
this
she
did
with
much
good
humour
explaining
frankly
that
fritz
would
have
to
prepare
the
new
circulars
and
that
she
must
discuss
with
him
the
nature
of
the
altered
propositions
which
were
to
be
made
to
the
public
fritz
of
course
came
and
was
closeted
with
her
for
a
full
hour
during
which
he
absolutely
prepared
the
document
for
the
innsbruck
printer
it
was
a
simple
announcement
that
for
the
future
the
charge
made
at
the
brunnenthal
peacock
would
be
seven
and
a
half
zwansigers
per
head
per
day
it
then
went
on
to
declare
that
as
heretofore
the
frau
frohmann
would
endeavour
to
give
satisfaction
to
all
those
who
would
do
her
the
honour
of
visiting
her
establishment
and
instructions
were
given
to
schlessen
as
to
sending
the
circulars
out
to
the
public
but
whatever
you
do
said
the
frau
don
t
send
one
to
those
tendel
and
something
else
was
settled
at
this
conference
as
soon
as
it
was
over
fritz
schlessen
was
encountered
by
malchen
who
on
such
occasions
would
never
be
far
away
though
the
spot
on
which
they
met
was
one
which
might
not
have
been
altogether
secure
from
intrusive
eyes
he
took
her
fondly
by
the
waist
and
whispered
a
word
in
her
ear
and
will
that
do
asked
malchen
anxiously
to
which
question
his
reply
was
made
by
a
kiss
in
that
whisper
he
had
conveyed
to
her
the
amount
now
fixed
for
the
mitgift
chapter
viii
it
doesn
t
make
any
difference
to
any
of
them
and
so
frau
frohmann
had
raised
her
prices
and
had
acknowledged
herself
to
all
the
world
to
have
been
beaten
in
her
enterprise
there
are
however
certain
misfortunes
which
are
infinitely
worse
in
their
anticipation
than
in
their
reality
and
this
which
had
been
looked
forward
to
as
a
terrible
humiliation
was
soon
found
to
be
one
of
them
no
note
of
triumph
was
sounded
none
at
least
reached
her
ear
indeed
it
so
fell
out
that
those
with
whom
she
had
quarrelled
for
awhile
seemed
now
to
be
more
friendly
with
her
than
ever
between
her
and
hoff
things
were
so
sweet
that
no
mention
was
ever
made
of
money
the
meat
was
sent
and
the
bills
were
paid
with
a
reticence
which
almost
implied
that
it
was
not
trade
but
an
amiable
giving
and
taking
of
the
good
things
of
the
world
there
had
never
been
a
word
of
explanation
with
seppel
but
he
was
late
and
early
about
the
carts
and
the
furniture
and
innumerable
little
acts
of
kindnesses
made
their
way
up
to
the
mother
and
her
many
children
suse
and
josephine
had
never
been
so
brisk
and
the
eggs
had
never
been
so
fresh
or
the
vegetables
so
good
except
from
the
working
of
her
own
mind
she
received
no
wounds
but
the
real
commencement
of
the
matter
did
not
take
place
till
the
following
summer
the
commencement
as
regarded
the
public
the
circulars
were
sent
out
but
to
such
letters
no
answers
are
returned
and
up
to
the
following
june
the
frau
was
ignorant
what
effect
the
charge
would
have
upon
the
coming
of
her
customers
there
were
times
at
which
she
thought
that
her
house
would
be
left
desolate
that
the
extra
charge
would
turn
away
from
her
the
hearts
of
her
visitors
and
that
in
this
way
she
would
be
compelled
to
retire
to
schwatz
suppose
they
don
t
come
at
all
she
said
to
peter
one
day
that
would
be
very
bad
said
peter
who
also
had
his
fears
in
the
same
direction
fritz
schlessen
thinks
it
won
t
make
any
difference
said
the
frau
a
zwansiger
and
a
half
a
day
does
make
a
difference
to
most
men
replied
peter
uncomfortably
this
was
uncomfortable
but
when
schlessen
came
out
he
raised
her
spirits
perhaps
old
weiss
won
t
come
he
said
but
then
there
will
be
plenty
in
his
place
there
are
houses
like
the
peacock
all
over
the
country
now
in
the
engadine
and
the
bregenz
and
the
salzkammergut
and
it
seems
to
me
the
more
they
charge
the
fuller
they
but
they
are
for
the
grand
for
anybody
that
chooses
it
has
come
to
that
that
the
more
money
people
are
charged
the
better
they
like
it
money
has
become
so
plentiful
with
the
rich
that
they
don
t
know
what
to
do
with
this
was
a
repetition
of
cartwright
s
barn
full
of
gold
there
was
something
in
the
assertion
that
money
could
be
plentiful
in
the
idea
that
gold
could
be
a
drug
which
savoured
to
her
of
innovation
and
was
therefore
unpleasant
she
still
felt
that
the
old
times
were
good
and
that
no
other
times
could
be
so
good
as
the
old
times
but
if
the
people
would
come
and
fill
her
house
and
pay
her
the
zwansiger
and
a
half
extra
without
grumbling
there
would
be
some
consolation
in
it
early
in
june
malchen
made
a
call
at
the
house
of
the
frauleins
tendel
malchen
at
this
time
was
known
to
all
innsbruck
as
the
handsome
frau
schlessen
who
had
been
brought
home
in
the
winter
to
her
husband
s
house
with
so
very
comfortable
a
mitgift
in
her
hand
that
was
now
quite
an
old
story
and
there
were
people
in
the
town
who
said
that
the
young
wife
already
knew
quite
as
much
about
her
husband
s
business
as
she
had
ever
done
about
her
mother
s
but
at
this
moment
she
was
obeying
one
of
her
mother
s
commands
mother
hopes
you
are
both
coming
out
to
the
brunnenthal
this
year
said
malchen
the
elder
fraulein
shook
her
head
sadly
because
then
malchen
paused
and
the
younger
of
the
two
ladies
shook
her
head
because
you
always
have
been
yes
we
mother
means
this
the
change
in
the
price
won
t
have
anything
to
do
with
you
if
you
will
we
couldn
t
think
of
that
then
mother
will
be
very
unhappy
that
s
all
the
new
circular
was
not
sent
to
of
course
we
heard
of
if
you
don
t
come
mother
will
take
it
very
then
of
course
the
ladies
said
they
would
come
and
so
that
little
difficulty
was
overcome
this
took
place
in
june
but
at
that
time
the
young
wife
was
staying
out
in
the
valley
with
her
mother
and
had
only
gone
into
innsbruck
on
a
visit
she
was
with
her
mother
preparing
for
the
guests
but
perhaps
as
the
frau
too
often
thought
preparing
for
guests
who
would
never
arrive
from
day
to
day
however
there
came
letters
bespeaking
rooms
as
usual
and
when
the
of
june
came
there
was
herr
weiss
with
all
his
family
she
had
taught
herself
to
regard
the
coming
of
the
weisses
as
a
kind
of
touchstone
by
which
she
might
judge
of
the
success
of
what
she
had
done
if
he
remained
away
it
would
be
because
in
spite
of
the
increase
in
his
salary
he
could
not
encounter
the
higher
cost
of
this
recreation
for
his
wife
and
family
he
was
himself
too
fond
of
the
good
living
of
the
peacock
not
to
come
if
he
could
afford
it
but
if
he
could
not
pay
so
much
then
neither
could
others
in
his
rank
of
life
and
it
would
be
sad
indeed
to
the
frau
if
her
house
were
to
be
closed
to
her
neighbour
germans
even
though
she
might
succeed
in
filling
it
with
foreigners
from
a
distance
but
now
the
weisses
had
come
not
having
given
their
usual
notice
but
having
sent
a
message
for
rooms
only
two
days
before
their
arrival
and
at
once
there
was
a
little
sparring
match
between
herr
weiss
and
the
frau
i
didn
t
suppose
that
there
would
be
much
trouble
as
to
finding
rooms
said
herr
weiss
why
shouldn
t
there
be
as
much
trouble
as
usual
asked
the
frau
in
return
she
had
felt
that
there
was
some
slight
in
this
arrival
of
the
whole
family
without
the
usual
preliminary
inquiries
as
though
there
would
never
again
be
competition
for
rooms
at
the
peacock
well
my
friend
i
suppose
that
that
little
letter
which
was
sent
about
the
country
will
make
a
that
s
as
people
like
to
take
it
it
hasn
t
made
any
difference
with
you
it
i
had
to
think
a
good
deal
about
it
frau
frohmann
and
i
suppose
we
shall
have
to
make
our
stay
shorter
i
own
i
am
a
little
surprised
to
see
the
tendel
women
here
a
zwansiger
and
a
half
a
day
comes
to
a
deal
of
money
at
the
end
of
a
month
when
there
are
two
or
i
am
happy
to
think
it
won
t
hurt
you
herr
weiss
as
you
have
had
your
salary
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
frau
frohmann
said
the
magistrate
almost
with
a
touch
of
anger
all
the
world
knew
or
ought
to
know
how
very
insufficient
was
his
stipend
when
compared
with
the
invaluable
public
services
which
he
rendered
such
at
least
was
the
light
in
which
he
looked
at
the
question
at
any
rate
said
the
frau
as
he
stalked
away
the
house
is
like
to
be
as
full
as
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
i
am
glad
to
hear
these
were
his
last
words
on
the
occasion
but
before
the
day
was
over
he
told
his
wife
that
he
thought
the
place
was
not
as
comfortable
as
usual
and
that
the
frau
with
her
high
prices
was
more
upsetting
than
ever
his
wife
who
took
delight
in
being
called
madame
weiss
at
brixen
and
who
considered
herself
to
be
in
some
degree
a
lady
of
fashion
had
nevertheless
been
very
much
disturbed
in
her
mind
by
the
increased
prices
and
had
suggested
that
the
place
should
be
abandoned
a
raising
of
prices
was
in
her
eyes
extortion
though
a
small
raising
of
salary
was
simply
justice
and
as
she
thought
inadequate
justice
but
the
living
at
the
peacock
was
good
nobody
could
deny
that
and
when
a
man
is
taken
away
from
the
comforts
of
his
home
how
is
he
to
console
himself
in
the
midst
of
his
idleness
unless
he
has
a
good
dinner
herr
weiss
had
therefore
determined
to
endure
the
injury
and
as
usual
to
pass
his
holiday
in
the
brunnenthal
but
when
madame
weiss
saw
those
two
frauleins
from
innsbruck
in
the
house
whose
means
she
knew
down
to
the
last
kreutzer
and
who
certainly
could
not
afford
the
increased
demand
she
thought
that
there
must
be
something
not
apparent
to
view
could
it
be
possible
that
the
frau
should
be
so
unjust
so
dishonest
so
extortious
as
to
have
different
prices
for
different
neighbours
that
an
englishman
or
even
a
german
from
berlin
should
be
charged
something
extra
might
not
perhaps
be
unjust
or
extortious
but
among
friends
of
the
same
district
to
put
a
zwansiger
and
a
half
on
to
one
and
not
to
another
seemed
to
madame
weiss
to
be
a
sin
for
which
there
should
be
no
pardon
i
am
so
glad
to
see
you
here
she
said
to
the
younger
fraulein
that
is
so
kind
of
you
but
we
always
are
here
you
yes
yes
but
i
feared
that
perhaps
i
know
that
with
us
we
had
to
think
more
than
once
about
it
before
we
could
make
up
our
minds
to
pay
the
increased
charges
the
magistrat
felt
a
little
hurt
about
to
this
the
fraulein
at
first
answered
nothing
thinking
that
perhaps
she
ought
not
to
make
public
the
special
benevolence
shown
by
the
frau
to
herself
and
her
sister
a
zwansiger
and
a
half
each
is
a
great
deal
of
money
to
add
on
said
madame
weiss
it
is
we
might
have
got
it
cheaper
elsewhere
and
then
i
thought
that
perhaps
you
might
have
done
so
she
has
made
no
increase
to
us
said
the
poor
lady
who
at
last
was
forced
to
tell
the
truth
as
by
not
doing
so
she
would
have
been
guilty
of
a
direct
falsehood
in
allowing
it
to
be
supposed
that
she
and
her
sister
paid
the
increased
price
soh
oh
oh
exclaimed
madame
weiss
clasping
her
hands
together
and
bobbing
her
head
up
and
down
soh
oh
oh
she
had
found
it
all
out
then
shortly
after
that
the
next
day
there
was
an
uncomfortable
perturbation
of
affairs
at
the
peacock
which
was
not
indeed
known
to
all
the
guests
but
which
to
those
who
heard
it
or
heard
of
it
seemed
for
the
time
to
be
very
terrible
madame
weiss
and
the
frau
had
what
is
commonly
called
a
few
words
together
frau
frohmann
said
madame
weiss
i
was
quite
astonished
to
hear
from
agatha
tendel
that
you
were
only
charging
them
the
old
why
shouldn
t
i
charge
them
just
what
i
please
or
nothing
at
all
if
i
pleased
asked
the
frau
sharply
of
course
you
can
but
i
do
think
among
neighbours
there
shouldn
t
be
one
price
to
one
and
one
to
would
it
do
you
any
good
frau
weiss
if
i
were
to
charge
those
ladies
more
than
they
can
pay
does
it
do
you
any
harm
if
they
live
here
at
a
cheap
rate
surely
there
should
be
one
price
among
neighbours
herr
weiss
got
my
circular
no
doubt
he
knew
i
don
t
suppose
he
wants
to
live
here
at
a
rate
less
than
it
costs
me
to
keep
him
you
and
he
can
do
what
you
like
about
coming
and
you
and
he
can
do
what
you
like
about
staying
away
you
knew
my
prices
i
have
not
made
any
secret
about
the
change
but
as
for
interference
between
me
and
my
other
customers
it
is
what
i
won
t
put
up
with
so
now
you
know
all
about
by
the
end
of
her
speech
the
frau
had
worked
herself
up
into
a
grand
passion
and
spoke
aloud
so
that
all
near
her
heard
her
then
there
was
a
great
commotion
in
the
peacock
and
it
was
thought
that
the
weisses
would
go
away
but
they
remained
for
their
allotted
time
this
was
the
only
disturbance
which
took
place
and
it
passed
off
altogether
to
the
credit
of
the
frau
something
in
a
vague
way
came
to
be
understood
about
fixed
incomes
so
that
peter
and
malchen
with
the
kaplan
even
down
to
seppel
and
suse
krapp
were
aware
that
the
two
frauleins
ought
not
to
be
made
to
pay
as
much
as
the
prosperous
magistrate
who
had
had
his
salary
raised
and
then
it
was
quite
understood
that
the
difference
made
in
favour
of
those
two
poor
ladies
was
a
kindness
shown
to
them
and
could
not
therefore
be
an
injury
to
any
one
else
later
in
the
year
when
the
establishment
was
full
and
everything
was
going
on
briskly
when
the
two
puddings
were
at
the
very
height
of
their
glory
and
the
wild
fruits
were
brought
up
on
the
in
huge
bowls
when
the
brunnenthal
was
at
its
loveliest
and
the
frau
was
appearing
on
holidays
in
her
gayest
costume
the
cartwrights
returned
to
the
valley
of
course
they
had
ordered
their
rooms
much
beforehand
and
the
frau
trusting
altogether
to
the
wisdom
of
those
counsels
which
she
did
not
even
yet
quite
understand
had
kept
her
very
best
apartments
for
them
the
greeting
between
them
was
most
friendly
the
frau
condescending
to
put
on
something
of
her
holiday
costume
to
add
honour
to
their
arrival
a
thing
which
she
had
never
been
known
to
do
before
on
behalf
of
any
guests
of
course
there
was
not
then
time
for
conversation
but
a
day
or
two
had
not
passed
before
she
made
known
to
cartwright
her
later
experience
the
people
have
come
sir
just
the
same
she
said
so
i
it
don
t
seem
to
make
any
difference
to
any
of
i
didn
t
think
it
would
and
i
don
t
suppose
anybody
has
well
there
was
a
little
said
by
one
lady
cartwright
but
that
was
not
because
i
charged
her
more
but
because
another
old
friend
was
allowed
to
pay
she
didn
t
do
you
any
harm
i
dare
harm
oh
dear
no
she
couldn
t
do
me
any
harm
if
she
tried
but
i
thought
i
d
tell
you
sir
because
you
said
it
would
be
so
the
people
don
t
seem
to
think
any
more
of
seven
zwansigers
and
a
half
than
they
do
of
six
it
s
very
odd
very
odd
indeed
i
suppose
it
s
all
right
sir
this
she
asked
still
thinking
that
there
must
be
something
wrong
in
the
world
when
so
monstrous
a
condition
of
things
seemed
to
prevail
they
d
think
a
great
deal
of
it
if
you
charged
them
more
than
they
believed
sufficient
to
give
you
a
fair
profit
for
your
outlay
and
how
can
they
know
anything
about
it
cartwright
ah
indeed
how
do
they
but
they
do
you
and
i
frau
frohmann
must
study
these
matters
very
closely
before
we
can
find
out
how
they
adjust
themselves
but
we
may
be
sure
of
this
that
the
world
will
never
complain
of
fair
prices
will
never
long
endure
unfair
prices
and
will
give
no
thanks
at
all
to
those
who
sell
their
goods
at
a
the
frau
curtseyed
and
retired
quite
satisfied
that
she
had
done
the
right
thing
in
raising
her
prices
but
still
feeling
that
she
had
many
a
struggle
to
make
before
she
could
understand
the
matter
the
lady
of
launay
chapter
i
how
bessy
pryor
became
a
young
lady
of
importance
how
great
is
the
difference
between
doing
our
duty
and
desiring
to
do
it
between
doing
our
duty
and
a
conscientious
struggle
to
do
it
between
duty
really
done
and
that
satisfactory
state
of
mind
which
comes
from
a
conviction
that
it
has
been
performed
mrs
miles
was
a
lady
who
through
her
whole
life
had
thought
of
little
else
than
duty
though
she
was
possessed
of
wealth
and
social
position
though
she
had
been
a
beautiful
woman
though
all
phases
of
life
had
been
open
to
her
she
had
always
adhered
to
her
own
idea
of
duty
many
delights
had
tempted
her
she
would
fain
have
travelled
so
as
to
see
the
loveliness
of
the
world
but
she
had
always
remained
at
home
she
could
have
enjoyed
the
society
of
intelligent
sojourners
in
capitals
but
she
had
confined
herself
to
that
of
her
country
neighbours
in
early
youth
she
had
felt
herself
to
be
influenced
by
a
taste
for
dress
she
had
consequently
compelled
herself
to
use
raiment
of
extreme
simplicity
she
would
buy
no
pictures
no
gems
no
china
because
when
young
she
found
that
she
liked
such
things
too
well
she
would
not
leave
the
parish
church
to
hear
a
good
sermon
elsewhere
because
even
a
sermon
might
be
a
snare
in
the
early
days
of
her
widowed
life
it
became
she
thought
her
duty
to
adopt
one
of
two
little
motherless
fatherless
girls
who
had
been
left
altogether
unprovided
for
in
the
world
and
having
the
choice
between
the
two
she
took
the
plain
one
who
had
weak
eyes
and
a
downcast
unhappy
look
because
it
was
her
duty
to
deny
herself
it
was
not
her
fault
that
the
child
who
was
so
unattractive
at
six
had
become
beautiful
at
sixteen
with
sweet
soft
eyes
still
downcast
occasionally
as
though
ashamed
of
their
own
loveliness
nor
was
it
her
fault
that
bessy
pryor
had
so
ministered
to
her
in
her
advancing
years
as
almost
to
force
upon
her
the
delights
of
mrs
miles
had
struggled
manfully
against
these
wiles
and
in
the
performance
of
her
duty
had
fought
with
them
even
to
an
attempt
to
make
herself
generally
disagreeable
to
the
young
child
the
child
however
had
conquered
having
wound
herself
into
the
old
woman
s
heart
of
hearts
when
bessy
at
fifteen
was
like
to
die
mrs
miles
for
awhile
broke
down
altogether
she
lingered
by
the
bedside
caressed
the
thin
hands
stroked
the
soft
locks
and
prayed
to
the
lord
to
stay
his
hand
and
to
alter
his
purpose
but
when
bessy
was
strong
again
she
strove
to
return
to
her
wonted
duties
but
bessy
through
it
all
was
quite
aware
that
she
was
loved
looking
back
at
her
own
past
life
and
looking
also
at
her
days
as
they
were
passing
mrs
miles
thought
that
she
did
her
duty
as
well
as
it
is
given
to
frail
man
or
frail
woman
to
perform
it
there
had
been
lapses
but
still
she
was
conscious
of
great
strength
she
did
believe
of
herself
that
should
a
great
temptation
come
in
her
way
she
would
stand
strong
against
it
a
great
temptation
did
come
in
her
way
and
it
is
the
purport
of
this
little
story
to
tell
how
far
she
stood
and
how
far
she
fell
something
must
be
communicated
to
the
reader
of
her
condition
in
life
and
of
bessy
s
something
but
not
much
mrs
miles
had
been
a
miss
launay
and
by
the
death
of
four
brothers
almost
in
their
infancy
had
become
heiress
to
a
large
property
in
somersetshire
at
she
was
married
to
mr
miles
who
had
a
property
of
his
own
in
the
next
county
and
who
at
the
time
of
their
marriage
represented
that
county
in
parliament
when
she
had
been
married
a
dozen
years
she
was
left
a
widow
with
two
sons
the
younger
of
whom
was
then
about
three
years
old
her
own
property
which
was
much
the
larger
of
the
two
was
absolutely
her
own
but
was
intended
for
philip
who
was
her
younger
boy
frank
miles
who
was
eight
years
older
inherited
the
other
circumstances
took
him
much
away
from
his
mother
s
wings
there
were
troubles
among
trustees
and
executors
and
the
father
s
heir
after
he
came
of
age
saw
but
little
of
his
mother
she
did
her
duty
but
what
she
suffered
in
doing
it
may
be
imagined
philip
was
brought
up
by
his
mother
who
perhaps
had
some
consolation
in
remembering
that
the
younger
boy
who
was
always
good
to
her
would
become
a
man
of
higher
standing
in
the
world
than
his
brother
he
was
called
philip
launay
the
family
name
having
passed
on
through
the
mother
to
the
intended
heir
of
the
launay
property
he
was
thirteen
when
bessy
pryor
was
brought
home
to
launay
park
and
as
a
had
been
good
to
the
poor
little
creature
who
for
the
first
year
or
two
had
hardly
dared
to
think
her
life
her
own
amidst
the
strange
huge
spaces
of
the
great
house
he
had
despised
her
of
course
but
had
not
been
boyishly
cruel
to
her
and
had
given
her
his
old
playthings
everybody
at
launay
had
at
first
despised
bessy
pryor
though
the
mistress
of
the
house
had
been
thoroughly
good
to
her
there
was
no
real
link
between
her
and
launay
pryor
had
as
a
humble
friend
been
under
great
obligations
to
launay
and
these
obligations
as
is
their
wont
had
produced
deep
love
in
the
heart
of
the
person
conferring
them
then
both
and
pryor
had
died
and
mrs
miles
had
declared
that
she
would
take
one
of
the
children
she
fully
intended
to
bring
the
girl
up
sternly
and
well
with
hard
belongings
such
as
might
suit
her
condition
but
there
had
been
lapses
occasioned
by
those
unfortunate
female
prettinesses
and
by
that
equally
unfortunate
sickness
bessy
never
rebelled
and
gave
therefore
no
scope
to
an
exhibition
of
extreme
duty
and
she
had
a
way
of
kissing
her
adopted
mamma
which
mrs
miles
knew
to
be
dangerous
she
struggled
not
to
be
kissed
but
ineffectually
she
preached
to
herself
in
the
solitude
of
her
own
room
sharp
sermons
against
the
sweet
softness
of
the
girl
s
caresses
but
she
could
not
put
a
stop
to
them
yes
i
will
the
girl
would
say
so
softly
but
so
persistently
then
there
would
be
a
great
embrace
which
mrs
miles
felt
to
be
as
dangerous
as
a
diamond
as
bad
as
a
box
at
the
opera
bessy
had
been
despised
at
first
all
around
launay
unattractive
children
are
despised
especially
when
as
in
this
case
they
are
nobodies
bessy
pryor
was
quite
nobody
and
certainly
there
had
never
been
a
child
more
powerless
to
assert
herself
she
was
for
a
year
or
two
inferior
to
the
parson
s
children
and
was
not
thought
much
of
by
the
farmers
wives
the
servants
called
her
miss
bessy
of
course
but
it
was
not
till
after
that
illness
that
there
existed
among
them
any
of
that
reverence
which
is
generally
felt
in
the
servants
hall
for
the
young
ladies
of
the
house
it
was
then
too
that
the
parson
s
daughters
found
that
bessy
was
nice
to
walk
with
and
that
the
tenants
began
to
make
much
of
her
when
she
called
the
old
lady
s
secret
manifestations
in
the
sick
bedroom
had
perhaps
been
seen
the
respect
paid
to
mrs
miles
in
that
and
the
next
parish
was
of
the
most
reverential
kind
had
she
chosen
that
a
dog
should
be
treated
as
one
of
the
launays
the
dog
would
have
received
all
the
family
honours
it
must
be
acknowledged
of
her
that
in
the
performance
of
her
duty
she
had
become
a
rural
tyrant
she
gave
away
many
petticoats
but
they
all
had
to
be
stitched
according
to
her
idea
of
stitching
a
petticoat
she
administered
physic
gratis
to
the
entire
estate
but
the
estate
had
to
take
the
doses
as
she
chose
to
have
them
mixed
it
was
because
she
had
fallen
something
short
of
her
acknowledged
duty
in
regard
to
bessy
pryor
that
the
parson
s
daughters
were
soon
even
proud
of
an
intimacy
with
the
girl
and
that
the
old
butler
when
she
once
went
away
for
a
week
in
the
winter
was
so
careful
to
wrap
her
feet
up
warm
in
the
carriage
in
this
way
during
the
two
years
subsequent
to
bessy
s
illness
there
had
gradually
come
up
an
altered
condition
of
life
at
launay
it
could
not
have
been
said
before
that
bessy
though
she
had
been
miss
bessy
was
as
a
daughter
in
the
house
but
now
a
daughter
s
privileges
were
accorded
to
her
when
the
old
squiress
was
driven
out
about
the
county
bessy
was
expected
but
was
asked
rather
than
ordered
to
accompany
her
she
always
went
but
went
because
she
decided
on
going
not
because
she
was
told
and
she
had
a
horse
to
ride
and
she
was
allowed
to
arrange
flowers
for
the
and
the
gardener
did
what
she
told
him
what
daughter
could
have
more
extensive
privileges
but
poor
mrs
miles
had
her
misgivings
often
asking
herself
what
would
come
of
it
all
when
bessy
had
been
recovering
from
her
illness
philip
who
was
seven
years
her
senior
was
making
a
grand
tour
about
the
world
he
had
determined
to
see
not
paris
vienna
and
rome
which
used
to
make
a
grand
tour
but
japan
patagonia
and
the
south
sea
islands
he
had
gone
in
such
a
way
as
to
ensure
the
consent
of
his
mother
two
other
young
men
of
fortune
had
accompanied
him
and
they
had
been
intent
on
botany
the
social
condition
of
natives
and
the
progress
of
the
world
generally
there
had
been
no
rushing
about
without
an
object
philip
had
been
away
for
more
than
two
years
and
had
seen
all
there
was
to
be
seen
in
japan
patagonia
and
the
south
sea
islands
between
them
the
young
men
had
written
a
book
and
the
critics
had
been
unanimous
in
observing
how
improved
in
those
days
were
the
aspirations
of
young
men
on
his
return
he
came
to
launay
for
a
week
or
two
and
then
went
up
to
london
when
after
four
months
he
returned
to
his
mother
s
house
he
was
years
of
age
and
bessy
was
just
twenty
mrs
miles
knew
that
there
was
cause
for
fear
but
she
had
already
taken
steps
to
prevent
the
danger
which
she
had
foreseen
chapter
ii
how
bessy
pryor
wouldn
t
marry
the
parson
of
course
there
would
be
danger
mrs
miles
had
been
aware
of
that
from
the
commencement
of
things
there
had
been
to
her
a
sort
of
pleasure
in
feeling
that
she
had
undertaken
a
duty
which
might
possibly
lead
to
circumstances
which
would
be
altogether
the
duty
of
mothering
bessy
was
so
much
more
a
duty
because
even
when
the
little
girl
was
and
thin
there
was
present
to
her
mind
all
the
horror
of
a
love
affair
between
her
son
and
the
little
girl
the
mileses
had
always
been
much
and
the
launays
very
much
in
the
west
of
england
bessy
had
not
a
single
belonging
that
was
anything
then
she
had
become
beautiful
and
attractive
and
worse
than
that
so
much
of
a
person
about
the
house
that
philip
himself
might
be
tempted
to
think
that
she
was
fit
to
be
his
wife
among
the
duties
prescribed
to
herself
by
mrs
miles
was
none
stronger
than
that
of
maintaining
the
family
position
of
the
launays
she
was
one
of
those
who
not
only
think
that
blue
blood
should
remain
blue
but
that
blood
not
blue
should
be
allowed
no
azure
mixture
the
proper
severance
of
classes
was
a
religion
to
her
bessy
was
a
gentlewoman
so
much
had
been
admitted
and
therefore
she
had
been
brought
into
the
instead
of
being
relegated
among
the
servants
and
had
thus
grown
up
to
be
oh
so
dangerous
she
was
a
gentlewoman
and
fit
to
be
a
gentleman
s
wife
but
not
fit
to
be
the
wife
of
the
heir
of
the
launays
the
reader
will
understand
perhaps
that
i
the
writer
of
this
little
history
think
her
to
have
been
fit
to
become
the
wife
of
any
man
who
might
have
been
happy
enough
to
win
her
young
heart
however
blue
his
blood
but
mrs
miles
had
felt
that
precautions
and
remedies
and
arrangements
were
necessary
mrs
miles
had
altogether
approved
of
the
journey
to
japan
that
had
been
a
preventive
and
might
probably
afford
time
for
an
arrangement
she
had
even
used
her
influence
to
prolong
the
travelling
till
the
arrangements
should
be
complete
but
in
this
she
had
failed
she
had
written
to
her
son
saying
that
as
his
sojourn
in
strange
lands
would
so
certainly
tend
to
the
amelioration
of
the
human
races
generally
for
she
had
heard
of
the
philanthropic
inquiries
of
the
book
and
the
botany
she
would
by
no
means
press
upon
him
her
own
natural
longings
if
another
year
was
required
the
necessary
remittances
should
be
made
with
a
liberal
hand
but
philip
who
had
chosen
to
go
because
he
liked
it
came
back
when
he
liked
it
and
there
he
was
at
launay
before
a
certain
portion
of
the
arrangements
had
been
completed
as
to
which
mrs
miles
had
been
urgent
during
the
last
six
months
of
his
absence
a
young
clergyman
in
the
neighbourhood
with
a
living
of
a
year
and
a
fortune
of
of
his
own
had
during
the
time
been
proposed
to
bessy
by
mrs
miles
morrison
the
rev
alexander
morrison
was
an
excellent
young
man
but
it
may
be
doubted
whether
the
patronage
by
which
he
was
put
into
the
living
of
budcombe
at
an
early
age
over
the
head
of
many
senior
curates
had
been
exercised
with
sound
clerical
motives
mrs
miles
was
herself
the
patroness
and
having
for
the
last
six
years
felt
the
necessity
of
providing
a
husband
for
bessy
had
looked
about
for
a
young
man
who
should
have
good
gifts
and
might
probably
make
her
happy
a
couple
of
thousand
pounds
added
had
at
first
suggested
itself
to
mrs
miles
then
love
had
ensnared
her
and
bessy
had
become
dear
to
every
one
and
money
was
plenty
the
thing
should
be
made
so
beautiful
to
all
concerned
that
there
should
be
no
doubt
of
its
acceptance
the
young
parson
didn
t
doubt
why
should
he
the
living
had
been
a
wonderful
stroke
of
luck
for
him
the
portion
proposed
would
put
him
at
once
among
the
gentlemen
of
the
county
and
then
the
girl
herself
bessy
had
loomed
upon
him
as
feminine
perfection
from
the
first
moment
he
had
seen
her
it
was
to
him
as
though
the
heavens
were
raining
their
choicest
blessings
on
his
head
nor
had
mrs
miles
any
reason
to
find
fault
with
bessy
had
bessy
jumped
into
the
man
s
arms
directly
he
had
been
offered
to
her
as
a
lover
mrs
miles
would
herself
have
been
shocked
she
knew
enough
of
bessy
to
be
sure
that
there
would
be
no
such
jumping
bessy
had
at
first
been
startled
and
throwing
herself
into
her
old
friend
s
arms
had
pleaded
her
youth
mrs
miles
had
accepted
the
embrace
had
acknowledged
the
plea
and
had
expressed
herself
quite
satisfied
simply
saying
that
morrison
would
be
allowed
to
come
about
the
house
and
use
his
own
efforts
to
make
himself
agreeable
the
young
parson
had
come
about
the
house
and
had
shown
himself
to
be
and
pleasant
bessy
never
said
a
word
against
him
did
in
truth
try
to
persuade
herself
that
it
would
be
nice
to
have
him
as
a
lover
but
she
failed
i
think
he
is
very
good
she
said
one
day
when
she
was
pressed
by
mrs
miles
and
he
is
a
oh
yes
said
bessy
and
i
don
t
know
that
that
no
my
dear
no
only
he
is
handsome
and
then
he
is
very
fond
of
but
bessy
would
not
commit
herself
and
certainly
had
never
given
any
encouragement
to
the
gentleman
himself
this
had
taken
place
just
before
philip
s
return
at
that
time
his
stay
at
launay
was
to
be
short
and
during
his
sojourn
his
hands
were
to
be
very
full
there
would
not
be
much
danger
during
that
fortnight
as
bessy
was
not
prone
to
put
herself
forward
in
any
man
s
way
she
met
him
as
his
little
pet
of
former
days
and
treated
him
quite
as
though
he
were
a
superior
being
she
ran
about
for
him
as
he
arranged
his
botanical
treasures
and
took
in
all
that
he
said
about
the
races
mrs
miles
as
she
watched
them
still
trusted
that
there
might
be
no
danger
but
she
went
on
with
her
safeguards
i
hope
you
like
morrison
she
said
to
her
son
very
much
indeed
mother
but
why
do
you
ask
it
is
a
secret
but
i
ll
tell
you
i
think
he
will
become
the
husband
of
our
dear
marry
bessy
why
not
then
there
was
a
pause
you
know
how
dearly
i
love
bessy
i
hope
you
will
not
think
me
wrong
when
i
tell
you
that
i
propose
to
give
what
will
be
for
her
a
large
fortune
considering
all
you
should
treat
her
just
as
though
she
were
a
daughter
and
a
sister
said
philip
not
quite
that
but
you
will
not
begrudge
her
six
thousand
pounds
it
is
not
half
well
well
six
thousand
pounds
is
a
large
sum
of
money
to
give
away
however
i
am
sure
we
shall
not
differ
about
bessy
don
t
you
think
morrison
would
make
her
a
good
husband
philip
looked
very
serious
knitted
his
brows
and
left
the
room
saying
that
he
would
think
about
it
to
make
him
think
that
the
marriage
was
all
but
arranged
would
be
a
great
protection
there
was
a
protection
to
his
mother
also
in
hearing
him
speak
of
bessy
as
being
almost
a
sister
but
there
was
still
a
further
protection
down
away
in
cornwall
there
was
another
launay
heiress
coming
up
some
third
or
fourth
cousin
and
it
had
long
since
been
settled
among
certain
elders
that
the
launay
properties
should
be
combined
to
this
philip
had
given
no
absolute
assent
had
even
run
away
to
japan
just
when
it
had
been
intended
that
he
should
go
to
cornwall
the
launay
heiress
had
then
only
been
seventeen
and
it
had
been
felt
to
be
almost
as
well
that
there
should
be
delay
so
that
the
time
was
not
passed
by
the
young
man
in
dangerous
neighbourhoods
the
south
sea
islands
and
patagonia
had
been
safe
and
now
when
the
idea
of
combining
the
properties
was
again
mooted
he
at
first
said
nothing
against
it
surely
such
precautions
as
these
would
suffice
especially
as
bessy
s
retiring
nature
would
not
allow
her
to
fall
in
love
with
any
man
within
the
short
compass
of
a
fortnight
not
a
word
more
was
said
between
mrs
miles
and
her
son
as
to
the
prospects
of
morrison
not
a
word
more
then
she
was
intelligent
enough
to
perceive
that
the
match
was
not
agreeable
to
him
but
she
attributed
this
feeling
on
his
part
to
an
idea
that
bessy
ought
to
be
treated
in
all
respects
as
though
she
were
a
daughter
of
the
house
of
launay
the
idea
was
absurd
but
safe
the
match
if
it
could
be
managed
would
of
course
go
on
but
should
not
be
mentioned
to
him
again
till
it
could
be
named
as
a
thing
absolutely
arranged
but
there
was
no
present
danger
mrs
miles
felt
sure
that
there
was
no
present
danger
mrs
miles
had
seen
bessy
grow
out
of
meagre
thinness
and
early
want
of
ruddy
health
into
gradual
proportions
of
perfect
feminine
loveliness
but
having
seen
the
gradual
growth
she
did
not
know
how
lovely
the
girl
was
a
woman
hardly
ever
does
know
how
omnipotent
may
be
the
attraction
which
some
feminine
natures
and
some
feminine
forms
diffuse
unconsciously
on
the
young
men
around
them
but
philip
knew
or
rather
felt
as
he
walked
about
the
park
he
declared
to
himself
that
alexander
morrison
was
an
insufferably
impudent
clerical
prig
for
which
assertion
there
was
in
truth
no
ground
whatsoever
then
he
accused
his
mother
of
a
sordid
love
of
money
and
property
and
swore
to
himself
that
he
would
never
stir
a
step
towards
cornwall
if
they
chose
to
have
that
launay
girl
up
from
the
far
west
he
would
go
away
to
london
or
perhaps
back
to
japan
but
what
shocked
him
most
was
that
such
a
girl
as
bessy
a
girl
whom
he
treated
always
just
like
his
own
sister
should
give
herself
to
such
a
man
as
that
young
parson
at
the
very
first
asking
he
struck
the
trees
among
which
he
was
walking
with
his
stick
as
he
thought
of
the
meanness
of
feminine
nature
and
then
such
a
greasy
ugly
brute
but
morrison
was
not
at
all
greasy
and
would
have
been
acknowledged
by
the
world
at
large
to
be
much
better
looking
than
philip
launay
then
came
the
day
of
his
departure
he
was
going
up
to
london
in
march
to
see
his
book
through
the
press
make
himself
intimate
at
his
club
and
introduce
himself
generally
to
the
ways
of
that
life
which
was
to
be
his
hereafter
it
had
been
understood
that
he
was
to
pass
the
season
in
london
and
that
then
the
question
should
come
on
in
earnest
such
was
his
mother
s
understanding
but
by
this
time
by
the
day
of
his
departure
he
was
quite
determined
that
the
question
should
never
receive
any
consideration
at
his
hands
early
on
that
day
he
met
bessy
somewhere
about
the
house
she
was
very
sweet
to
him
on
this
occasion
partly
because
she
loved
him
dearly
as
her
adopted
brother
partly
because
he
was
going
partly
because
it
was
her
nature
to
be
sweet
there
is
one
question
i
want
to
ask
you
he
said
suddenly
turning
round
upon
her
with
a
frown
he
had
not
meant
to
frown
but
it
was
his
nature
to
do
so
when
his
heart
frowned
within
him
what
is
it
philip
she
turned
pale
as
she
spoke
but
looked
him
full
in
the
face
are
you
engaged
to
that
parson
she
went
on
looking
at
him
but
did
not
answer
a
word
are
you
going
to
marry
him
i
have
a
right
to
then
she
shook
her
head
you
certainly
are
not
now
as
he
spoke
his
voice
was
changed
and
the
frown
had
vanished
again
she
shook
her
head
then
he
got
hold
of
her
hand
and
she
left
her
hand
with
him
not
thinking
of
him
as
other
than
a
brother
i
am
so
glad
i
detest
that
oh
philip
he
is
very
good
i
do
not
care
for
his
goodness
you
are
quite
sure
now
she
nodded
her
head
it
would
have
been
most
awful
and
would
have
made
me
miserable
miserable
of
course
my
mother
is
the
best
woman
in
the
world
but
why
can
t
she
let
people
alone
to
find
husbands
and
wives
for
themselves
there
was
a
slight
frown
and
then
with
a
visible
effort
he
completed
his
speech
bessy
you
have
grown
to
be
the
loveliest
woman
that
ever
i
looked
she
withdrew
her
hand
very
suddenly
philip
you
should
not
say
such
a
thing
as
why
not
if
i
think
it
people
should
never
say
anything
to
anybody
about
shouldn
t
they
you
know
what
i
mean
it
is
not
nice
it
s
the
sort
of
stuff
which
people
who
ain
t
ladies
and
gentlemen
put
into
i
should
have
thought
i
might
say
so
you
may
and
of
course
you
are
different
but
there
are
things
that
are
so
disagreeable
and
i
am
one
of
them
no
philip
you
are
the
truest
and
best
of
at
any
rate
you
won
t
then
he
paused
no
i
won
that
s
a
promise
to
your
best
and
dearest
brother
she
nodded
her
head
again
and
he
was
satisfied
he
went
away
and
when
he
returned
to
launay
at
the
end
of
four
months
he
found
that
things
were
not
going
on
pleasantly
at
the
park
morrison
had
been
refused
with
a
positive
assurance
from
the
young
lady
that
she
would
never
change
her
mind
and
mrs
miles
had
become
more
stern
than
ever
in
the
performance
of
her
duty
to
her
family
chapter
iii
how
bessy
pryor
came
to
love
the
heir
of
launay
matters
became
very
unpleasant
at
the
park
soon
after
philip
went
away
there
had
been
something
in
his
manner
as
he
left
and
a
silence
in
regard
to
him
on
bessy
s
part
which
created
not
at
first
surprise
but
uneasiness
in
the
mind
of
mrs
miles
bessy
hardly
mentioned
his
name
and
mrs
miles
knew
enough
of
the
world
to
feel
that
such
restraint
must
have
a
cause
it
would
have
been
natural
for
a
girl
so
circumstanced
to
have
been
full
of
philip
and
his
botany
feeling
this
she
instigated
the
parson
to
renewed
attempts
but
the
parson
had
to
tell
her
that
there
was
no
chance
for
him
what
has
she
said
asked
mrs
miles
that
it
can
never
but
it
shall
be
said
mrs
miles
stirred
on
this
occasion
to
an
assertion
of
the
obstinacy
which
was
in
her
nature
then
there
was
a
most
unpleasant
scene
between
the
old
lady
and
her
dependent
what
is
it
that
you
expect
she
asked
expect
aunt
bessy
had
been
instructed
to
call
mrs
miles
her
aunt
what
do
you
think
is
to
be
done
for
you
done
for
me
you
have
done
everything
may
i
not
stay
with
you
then
mrs
miles
gave
utterance
to
a
very
long
lecture
in
which
many
things
were
explained
to
bessy
bessy
s
position
was
said
to
be
one
very
peculiar
in
its
nature
were
mrs
miles
to
die
there
would
be
no
home
for
her
she
could
not
hope
to
find
a
home
in
philip
s
house
as
a
real
sister
might
have
done
everybody
loved
her
because
she
had
been
good
and
gracious
but
it
was
her
duty
to
marry
especially
her
duty
so
that
there
might
be
no
future
difficulty
morrison
was
exactly
the
man
that
such
a
girl
as
bessy
ought
to
want
as
a
husband
bessy
through
her
tears
declared
that
she
didn
t
want
any
husband
and
that
she
certainly
did
not
want
morrison
has
philip
said
anything
asked
the
imprudent
old
woman
then
bessy
was
silent
what
has
philip
said
to
you
i
told
him
when
he
asked
that
i
should
never
marry
then
it
was
in
that
very
moment
that
mrs
miles
in
truth
suspected
the
blow
that
was
to
fall
upon
her
and
in
that
same
moment
she
resolved
that
let
the
pain
be
what
it
might
to
any
or
all
of
them
she
would
do
her
duty
by
her
family
yes
she
said
to
herself
as
she
sat
alone
in
the
unadorned
unattractive
sanctity
of
her
own
bedroom
i
will
do
my
duty
at
any
rate
with
deep
remorse
she
acknowledged
to
herself
that
she
had
been
remiss
for
a
moment
her
anger
was
very
bitter
she
had
warmed
a
reptile
in
her
bosom
the
very
words
came
to
her
thoughts
though
they
were
not
pronounced
but
the
words
were
at
once
rejected
the
girl
had
been
no
reptile
the
girl
had
been
true
the
girl
had
been
as
sweet
a
girl
as
had
ever
brightened
the
hearth
of
an
old
woman
she
acknowledged
so
much
to
herself
even
in
this
moment
of
her
agony
but
not
the
less
would
she
do
her
duty
by
the
family
of
the
launays
let
the
girl
do
what
she
might
she
must
be
sent
away
got
rid
of
sacrificed
in
any
way
rather
than
that
philip
should
be
allowed
to
make
himself
a
fool
when
for
a
couple
of
days
she
had
turned
it
all
in
her
mind
she
did
not
believe
that
there
was
as
yet
any
understanding
between
the
girl
and
philip
but
still
she
was
sure
that
the
danger
existed
not
only
had
the
girl
refused
her
destined
husband
just
such
a
man
as
such
a
girl
as
bessy
ought
to
have
loved
but
she
had
communicated
her
purpose
in
that
respect
to
philip
there
had
been
more
of
confidence
between
them
than
between
her
and
the
girl
how
could
they
two
have
talked
on
such
a
subject
unless
there
had
been
between
them
something
of
stricter
closer
friendship
even
than
that
of
brother
and
sister
there
had
been
something
of
a
conspiracy
between
them
against
her
her
who
at
launay
was
held
to
be
omnipotent
against
her
who
had
in
her
hands
all
the
income
all
the
power
all
the
ownership
the
mother
of
one
of
them
and
the
protectress
and
only
friend
of
the
other
she
would
do
her
duty
let
bessy
be
ever
so
sweet
the
girl
must
be
made
to
marry
morrison
or
must
be
made
to
go
but
whither
should
she
go
and
if
that
whither
should
be
found
how
should
philip
be
prevented
from
following
her
mrs
miles
in
her
agony
conceived
an
idea
that
it
would
be
easier
to
deal
with
the
girl
herself
than
with
philip
a
woman
if
she
thinks
it
to
be
a
duty
will
more
readily
sacrifice
herself
in
the
performance
of
it
than
will
a
man
so
at
least
thought
mrs
miles
judging
from
her
own
feelings
and
bessy
was
very
good
very
affectionate
very
grateful
had
always
been
obedient
if
possible
she
should
be
driven
into
the
arms
of
morrison
should
she
stand
firm
against
such
efforts
as
could
be
made
in
that
direction
then
an
appeal
should
be
made
to
herself
after
all
that
had
been
done
for
her
would
she
ruin
the
family
of
the
launays
for
the
mere
whim
of
her
own
heart
during
the
process
of
driving
her
into
morrison
s
arms
a
process
which
from
first
to
last
was
altogether
hopeless
not
a
word
had
been
said
about
philip
but
bessy
understood
the
reticence
she
had
been
asked
as
to
her
promise
to
philip
and
never
forgot
that
she
had
been
asked
nor
did
she
ever
forget
those
words
which
at
the
moment
so
displeased
her
you
have
grown
to
be
the
loveliest
woman
that
i
have
ever
looked
she
remembered
now
that
he
had
held
her
hand
tightly
while
he
had
spoken
them
and
that
an
effort
had
been
necessary
as
she
withdrew
it
she
had
been
perfectly
serious
in
decrying
the
personal
compliment
but
still
still
there
had
been
a
flavour
of
love
in
the
words
which
now
remained
among
her
heartstrings
of
course
he
was
not
her
brother
not
even
her
cousin
there
was
not
a
touch
of
blood
between
them
to
warrant
such
a
compliment
as
a
joke
he
as
a
young
man
had
told
her
that
he
thought
her
as
a
young
woman
to
be
lovely
above
all
others
she
was
quite
sure
of
this
that
no
possible
amount
of
driving
should
drive
her
into
the
arms
of
morrison
the
old
woman
became
more
and
more
stern
dear
aunt
bessy
said
to
her
one
day
with
an
air
of
firmness
which
had
evidently
been
assumed
purposely
for
the
occasion
indeed
indeed
i
can
not
love
then
mrs
miles
had
resolved
that
she
must
resort
to
the
other
alternative
bessy
must
go
she
did
believe
that
when
everything
should
be
explained
bessy
herself
would
raise
no
difficulty
as
to
her
own
going
bessy
had
no
more
right
to
live
at
launay
than
had
any
other
fatherless
motherless
penniless
living
creature
but
how
to
explain
it
what
reason
should
be
given
and
whither
should
the
girl
be
sent
then
there
came
delay
caused
by
another
great
trouble
on
a
sudden
mrs
miles
was
very
ill
this
began
about
the
end
of
may
when
philip
was
still
up
in
london
inhaling
the
incense
which
came
up
from
the
success
of
his
book
at
first
she
was
very
eager
that
her
son
should
not
be
recalled
to
launay
why
should
a
young
man
be
brought
into
the
house
with
a
sick
old
woman
of
course
she
was
eager
what
evils
might
not
happen
if
they
two
were
brought
together
during
her
illness
at
the
end
of
three
weeks
however
she
was
worse
so
much
worse
that
the
people
around
her
were
afraid
and
it
became
manifest
to
all
of
them
that
the
truth
must
be
told
to
philip
in
spite
of
her
injunctions
bessy
s
position
became
one
of
great
difficulty
because
words
fell
from
mrs
miles
which
explained
to
her
almost
with
accuracy
the
condition
of
her
aunt
s
mind
you
should
not
be
here
she
said
over
and
over
again
now
it
had
been
the
case
as
a
matter
of
course
that
bessy
during
the
old
lady
s
illness
had
never
left
her
bedside
day
or
night
of
course
she
had
been
the
nurse
of
course
she
had
tended
the
invalid
in
everything
it
had
been
so
much
a
matter
of
course
that
the
poor
lady
had
been
impotent
to
prevent
it
in
her
ineffectual
efforts
to
put
an
end
to
bessy
s
influence
the
servants
even
the
doctors
obeyed
bessy
in
regard
to
the
household
matters
mrs
miles
found
herself
quite
unable
to
repel
bessy
from
her
bedside
and
then
with
her
mind
always
intent
on
the
necessity
of
keeping
the
young
people
apart
and
when
it
was
all
but
settled
that
philip
should
be
summoned
she
said
again
and
again
you
should
not
be
here
bessy
you
must
not
be
here
but
whither
should
she
go
no
place
was
even
suggested
to
her
and
were
she
herself
to
consult
some
other
friend
as
to
a
place
the
clergyman
of
their
own
parish
for
instance
who
out
of
that
house
was
her
most
intimate
friend
she
would
have
to
tell
the
whole
story
a
story
which
could
not
be
told
by
her
lips
philip
had
never
said
a
word
to
her
except
that
one
word
you
have
grown
to
be
the
loveliest
woman
that
ever
i
looked
the
word
was
very
frequent
in
her
thoughts
but
she
could
tell
no
one
of
that
if
he
did
think
her
lovely
if
he
did
love
her
why
should
not
things
run
smoothly
she
had
found
it
to
be
quite
out
of
the
question
that
she
should
be
driven
into
the
arms
of
morrison
but
she
soon
came
to
own
to
herself
that
she
might
easily
be
enticed
into
those
other
arms
but
then
perhaps
he
had
meant
nothing
so
probably
had
meant
nothing
but
if
not
why
should
she
be
driven
away
from
launay
as
her
aunt
became
worse
and
worse
and
when
philip
came
down
from
london
and
with
philip
a
london
physician
nothing
was
settled
about
poor
bessy
and
nothing
was
done
when
philip
and
bessy
stood
together
at
the
sick
woman
s
bedside
she
was
nearly
insensible
wandering
in
her
mind
but
still
with
that
care
heavy
at
her
heart
no
philip
no
no
no
she
said
what
is
it
mother
asked
philip
then
bessy
escaped
from
the
room
and
resolved
that
she
would
always
be
absent
when
philip
was
by
his
mother
s
bedside
there
was
a
week
in
which
the
case
was
almost
hopeless
and
then
a
week
during
which
the
mistress
of
launay
crept
slowly
back
to
life
it
could
not
but
be
that
they
two
should
see
much
of
each
other
during
such
weeks
at
every
meal
they
sat
together
bessy
was
still
constant
at
the
bedside
of
her
aunt
but
now
and
again
she
was
alone
with
philip
at
first
she
struggled
to
avoid
him
but
she
struggled
altogether
in
vain
he
would
not
be
avoided
and
then
of
course
he
spoke
bessy
i
am
sure
you
know
that
i
love
i
am
sure
i
hope
you
do
she
replied
purposely
misinterpreting
him
then
he
frowned
at
her
i
am
sure
bessy
you
are
above
all
what
subterfuges
why
do
you
say
that
you
are
no
sister
of
mine
no
cousin
even
you
know
what
i
mean
when
i
say
that
i
love
you
will
you
be
my
wife
oh
if
she
might
only
have
knelt
at
his
feet
and
hidden
her
face
among
her
hands
and
have
gladly
answered
him
with
a
little
yes
extracted
from
amidst
her
happy
blushes
but
in
every
way
there
was
no
time
for
such
joys
philip
think
how
ill
your
mother
is
she
said
that
can
not
change
it
i
have
to
ask
you
whether
you
can
love
me
i
am
bound
to
ask
you
whether
you
will
love
she
would
not
answer
him
then
but
during
that
second
week
in
which
mrs
miles
was
creeping
back
to
life
she
swore
that
she
did
love
him
and
would
love
him
and
would
be
true
to
him
for
ever
and
ever
chapter
iv
how
bessy
pryor
owned
that
she
was
engaged
when
these
pretty
oaths
had
been
sworn
and
while
mrs
miles
was
too
ill
to
keep
her
eyes
upon
them
or
to
separate
them
of
course
the
two
lovers
were
much
together
for
whispering
words
of
love
for
swearing
oaths
for
sweet
kisses
and
looking
into
each
other
s
eyes
a
few
minutes
now
and
again
will
give
ample
opportunities
the
long
hours
of
the
day
and
night
were
passed
by
bessy
with
her
aunt
but
there
were
short
moments
heavenly
moments
which
sufficed
to
lift
her
off
the
earth
into
an
elysium
of
joy
his
love
for
her
was
so
perfect
so
assured
in
a
matter
such
as
this
he
said
in
his
fondly
serious
air
my
mother
can
have
no
right
to
interfere
with
but
with
me
she
may
said
bessy
foreseeing
in
the
midst
of
her
paradise
the
storm
which
would
surely
come
why
should
she
wish
to
do
so
why
should
she
not
allow
me
to
make
myself
happy
in
the
only
way
in
which
it
is
possible
there
was
such
an
ecstacy
of
bliss
coming
from
such
words
as
these
such
a
perfection
of
the
feeling
of
mutual
love
that
she
could
not
but
be
exalted
to
the
heavens
although
she
knew
that
the
storm
would
surely
come
if
her
love
would
make
him
happy
then
then
surely
he
should
be
happy
of
course
she
has
given
up
her
idea
about
that
parson
he
said
i
fear
she
has
not
it
seems
to
me
too
monstrous
that
any
human
being
should
go
to
work
and
settle
whom
two
other
human
beings
are
to
there
was
never
a
possibility
of
she
told
me
it
was
to
be
it
never
could
have
been
said
bessy
with
great
emphasis
not
even
for
her
much
as
i
love
her
not
even
for
her
to
whom
i
owe
everything
could
i
consent
to
marry
a
man
i
did
not
love
but
but
what
i
do
not
know
how
i
shall
answer
her
when
she
bids
me
give
you
up
oh
my
love
how
shall
i
answer
her
then
he
told
her
at
considerable
length
what
was
the
answer
which
he
thought
should
in
such
circumstances
be
made
to
his
mother
bessy
was
to
declare
that
nothing
could
alter
her
intentions
that
her
own
happiness
and
that
of
her
lover
depended
on
her
firmness
and
that
they
two
did
in
fact
intend
to
have
their
own
way
in
this
matter
sooner
or
later
bessy
as
she
heard
the
lesson
made
no
direct
reply
but
she
knew
too
well
that
it
could
be
of
no
service
to
her
all
that
it
would
be
possible
for
her
to
say
when
the
resolute
old
woman
should
declare
her
purpose
would
be
that
come
what
might
she
must
always
love
philip
launay
that
she
never
never
never
could
become
the
wife
of
any
other
man
so
much
she
thought
she
would
say
but
as
to
asserting
her
right
to
her
lover
that
she
was
sure
would
be
beyond
her
everyone
in
the
house
except
mrs
miles
was
aware
that
philip
and
bessy
were
lovers
and
from
the
dependents
of
the
house
the
tidings
spread
through
the
parish
there
had
been
no
special
secrecy
a
lover
does
not
usually
pronounce
his
vows
in
public
little
corners
and
twilight
hours
are
chosen
or
banks
beneath
the
trees
supposed
to
be
safe
from
vulgar
eyes
or
lonely
wanderings
philip
had
followed
the
usual
way
of
the
world
in
his
but
had
sought
his
secret
moments
with
no
special
secrecy
before
the
servants
he
would
whisper
to
bessy
with
that
look
of
thorough
confidence
in
his
eyes
which
servants
completely
understand
and
thus
while
the
poor
old
woman
was
still
in
her
bed
while
she
was
unaware
both
of
the
danger
and
of
her
own
immediate
impotence
the
secret
as
far
as
it
was
a
secret
became
known
to
all
launay
morrison
heard
it
over
at
budcombe
and
with
his
heart
down
in
his
boots
told
himself
that
now
certainly
there
could
be
no
chance
for
him
at
launay
gregory
was
the
rector
and
it
was
with
his
daughters
that
bessy
had
become
intimate
knowing
much
of
the
mind
of
the
first
lady
of
the
parish
he
took
upon
himself
to
say
a
word
or
two
to
philip
i
am
so
glad
to
hear
that
your
mother
is
much
better
this
very
much
it
has
been
a
most
serious
terribly
serious
then
there
was
a
pause
and
sundry
other
faltering
allusions
were
made
to
the
condition
of
things
up
at
the
house
from
which
philip
was
aware
that
words
of
counsel
or
perhaps
reproach
were
coming
i
hope
you
will
excuse
me
philip
if
i
tell
you
i
think
i
shall
excuse
anything
from
people
are
saying
about
the
place
that
during
your
mother
s
illness
you
have
engaged
yourself
to
bessy
that
s
very
odd
said
philip
odd
repeated
the
parson
very
odd
indeed
because
what
the
people
about
the
place
say
is
always
supposed
to
be
untrue
but
this
report
is
it
is
true
quite
true
and
i
am
proud
to
be
in
a
position
to
assure
you
that
i
have
been
accepted
i
am
really
sorry
for
morrison
you
but
what
will
your
mother
say
i
do
not
think
that
she
or
anyone
can
say
that
bessy
is
not
fit
to
be
the
wife
of
the
finest
gentleman
in
the
this
he
said
with
an
air
of
pride
which
showed
plainly
enough
that
he
did
not
intend
to
be
talked
out
of
his
purpose
i
should
not
have
spoken
but
that
your
dear
mother
is
so
ill
rejoined
the
parson
i
understand
that
i
must
fight
my
own
battle
and
bessy
s
as
best
i
may
but
you
may
be
quite
sure
gregory
that
i
mean
to
fight
nor
did
bessy
deny
the
fact
when
her
friend
mary
gregory
interrogated
her
the
question
of
bessy
s
marriage
with
morrison
had
somewhat
cruelly
in
regard
to
her
and
more
cruelly
still
in
regard
to
the
gentleman
become
public
property
in
the
neighbourhood
everybody
had
known
that
mrs
miles
intended
to
marry
bessy
to
the
parson
of
budcombe
and
everybody
had
thought
that
bessy
would
as
a
matter
of
course
accept
her
destiny
everybody
now
knew
that
bessy
had
rebelled
and
as
miles
s
autocratic
disposition
was
well
understood
everybody
was
waiting
to
see
what
would
come
of
it
the
neighbourhood
generally
thought
that
bessy
was
unreasonable
and
ungrateful
morrison
was
a
very
nice
man
and
nothing
could
have
been
more
appropriate
now
when
the
truth
came
out
everybody
was
very
much
interested
indeed
that
mrs
miles
should
assent
to
a
marriage
between
the
heir
and
bessy
pryor
was
quite
out
of
the
question
she
was
too
well
known
to
leave
a
doubt
on
the
mind
of
anyone
either
in
launay
or
budcombe
on
that
matter
men
and
women
drew
their
breath
and
looked
at
each
other
it
was
just
when
the
parishes
thought
that
she
was
going
to
die
that
the
parishioners
first
heard
that
bessy
would
not
marry
morrison
because
of
the
young
squire
and
now
when
it
was
known
that
mrs
miles
was
not
going
to
die
it
was
known
that
the
young
squire
was
absolutely
engaged
to
bessy
pryor
there
ll
be
a
deal
o
vat
in
the
voir
said
the
old
head
ploughman
of
launay
talking
over
the
matter
with
the
wife
of
gregory
s
gardener
there
was
going
to
be
a
deal
of
fat
in
the
mrs
miles
was
not
like
other
mothers
everything
in
respect
to
present
income
was
in
her
hands
and
bessy
was
not
like
other
girls
she
had
absolutely
no
locus
standi
in
the
world
except
what
came
to
her
from
the
bounty
of
the
old
lady
by
favour
of
the
lady
of
launay
she
held
her
head
among
the
girls
of
that
part
of
the
country
as
high
as
any
girl
there
she
was
only
bessy
pryor
but
from
love
and
kindness
she
was
the
recognised
daughter
of
the
house
of
launay
everybody
knew
it
all
everybody
was
aware
that
she
had
done
much
towards
reaching
her
present
position
by
her
own
special
sweetness
but
should
mrs
miles
once
frown
bessy
would
be
nobody
oh
bessy
how
is
this
all
to
be
asked
mary
gregory
as
god
pleases
said
bessy
very
solemnly
what
does
mrs
miles
say
i
don
t
want
anybody
to
ask
me
about
it
said
bessy
of
course
i
love
him
what
is
the
good
of
denying
it
but
i
can
not
talk
about
then
mary
gregory
looked
as
though
some
terrible
secret
had
been
revealed
to
her
some
secret
of
which
the
burden
might
probably
be
too
much
for
her
to
bear
the
first
storm
arose
from
an
interview
which
took
place
between
the
mother
and
son
as
soon
as
the
mother
found
herself
able
to
speak
on
a
subject
which
was
near
her
heart
she
sent
for
him
and
once
again
besought
him
to
take
steps
towards
that
combining
of
the
properties
which
was
so
essential
to
the
launay
interests
generally
then
he
declared
his
purpose
very
plainly
he
did
not
intend
to
combine
the
properties
he
did
not
care
for
the
launay
cousin
it
was
his
intention
to
marry
bessy
pryor
yes
he
had
proposed
to
her
and
she
had
accepted
him
the
poor
sick
mother
was
at
first
almost
overwhelmed
with
despair
what
can
i
do
but
tell
you
the
truth
when
you
ask
me
he
said
do
she
screamed
what
could
you
do
you
could
have
remembered
your
honour
you
could
have
remembered
your
blood
you
could
have
remembered
your
duty
then
she
bade
him
leave
her
and
after
an
hour
passed
in
thought
she
sent
for
bessy
i
have
had
my
son
with
me
she
said
sitting
bolt
upright
in
her
bed
looking
awful
in
her
wanness
speaking
with
low
studied
harsh
voice
with
her
two
hands
before
her
on
the
counterpane
i
have
had
my
son
with
me
and
he
has
told
bessy
felt
that
she
was
trembling
she
was
hardly
able
to
support
herself
she
had
not
a
word
to
say
the
sick
old
woman
was
terrible
in
her
severity
is
it
true
yes
it
is
true
whispered
bessy
and
this
is
to
be
my
return
oh
my
dearest
my
darling
oh
my
aunt
dear
dearest
dearest
aunt
do
not
speak
like
that
do
not
look
at
me
like
that
you
know
i
love
you
don
t
you
know
i
love
you
then
bessy
prostrated
herself
on
the
bed
and
getting
hold
of
the
old
woman
s
hand
covered
it
with
kisses
yes
her
aunt
did
know
that
the
girl
loved
her
and
she
knew
that
she
loved
the
girl
perhaps
better
than
any
other
human
being
in
the
world
the
eldest
son
had
become
estranged
from
her
even
philip
had
not
been
half
so
much
to
her
as
this
girl
bessy
had
wound
herself
round
her
very
heartstrings
it
made
her
happy
even
to
sit
and
look
at
bessy
she
had
denied
herself
all
pretty
things
but
this
prettiest
of
all
things
had
grown
up
beneath
her
eyes
she
did
not
draw
away
her
hand
but
while
her
hand
was
being
kissed
she
made
up
her
mind
that
she
would
do
her
duty
of
what
service
will
be
your
love
she
said
if
this
is
to
be
my
return
bessy
could
only
lie
and
sob
and
hide
her
face
say
that
you
will
give
it
not
to
say
that
not
to
give
him
up
was
the
only
resolution
at
which
bessy
had
arrived
if
you
will
not
say
so
you
must
leave
me
and
i
shall
send
you
word
what
you
are
to
do
if
you
are
my
enemy
you
shall
not
remain
pray
pray
do
not
call
me
an
you
had
better
the
woman
s
voice
as
she
said
this
was
dreadful
in
its
harshness
then
bessy
slowly
creeping
down
from
the
bed
slowly
slunk
out
of
the
room
chapter
how
bessy
pryor
ceased
to
be
a
young
lady
of
importance
when
the
old
woman
was
alone
she
at
once
went
to
work
in
her
own
mind
resolving
what
should
be
her
course
of
proceeding
to
yield
in
the
matter
and
to
confirm
the
happiness
of
the
young
people
never
occurred
to
her
again
and
again
she
repeated
to
herself
that
she
would
do
her
duty
and
again
and
again
she
repeated
to
herself
that
in
allowing
philip
and
bessy
to
come
together
she
had
neglected
her
duty
that
her
duty
required
her
to
separate
them
in
spite
of
their
love
in
spite
of
their
engagement
though
all
the
happiness
of
their
lives
might
depend
upon
it
she
did
not
in
the
least
doubt
duty
is
duty
and
it
was
her
duty
to
aggrandise
the
house
of
launay
so
that
the
old
autocracy
of
the
land
might
so
far
as
in
her
lay
be
preserved
that
it
would
be
a
good
and
pious
thing
to
do
to
keep
them
apart
to
force
philip
to
marry
the
girl
in
cornwall
to
drive
bessy
into
morrison
s
arms
was
to
her
so
certain
that
it
required
no
further
thought
she
had
never
indulged
herself
her
life
had
been
so
led
as
to
maintain
the
power
of
her
own
order
and
relieve
the
wants
of
those
below
her
she
had
done
nothing
for
her
own
pleasure
how
should
it
occur
to
her
that
it
would
be
well
for
her
to
change
the
whole
course
of
her
life
in
order
that
she
might
administer
to
the
joys
of
a
young
man
and
a
young
woman
it
did
not
occur
to
her
to
do
so
lying
thus
all
alone
white
sick
and
feeble
but
very
strong
of
heart
she
made
her
resolutions
as
bessy
could
not
well
be
sent
out
of
the
house
till
a
home
should
be
provided
for
her
elsewhere
philip
should
be
made
to
go
as
that
was
to
be
the
first
step
she
again
sent
for
philip
that
day
no
mother
not
while
you
are
so
this
he
said
in
answer
to
her
first
command
that
he
should
leave
launay
at
once
it
had
not
occurred
to
him
that
the
house
in
which
he
had
been
born
and
bred
the
house
of
his
ancestors
the
house
which
he
had
always
supposed
was
at
some
future
day
to
be
his
own
was
not
free
to
him
but
feeble
as
she
was
she
soon
made
him
understand
her
purpose
he
must
go
because
she
ordered
him
because
the
house
was
hers
and
not
his
because
he
was
no
longer
welcome
there
as
a
guest
unless
he
would
promise
to
abandon
bessy
this
is
tyranny
mother
he
said
i
do
not
mean
to
argue
the
question
said
mrs
miles
leaning
back
among
the
pillows
gaunt
with
hollow
cheeks
yellow
with
her
long
sickness
seeming
to
be
all
eyes
as
she
looked
at
him
i
tell
you
that
you
must
mother
then
at
considerable
length
she
explained
her
intended
arrangements
he
must
go
and
live
upon
the
very
modest
income
which
she
proposed
at
any
rate
he
must
go
and
go
at
once
the
house
was
hers
and
she
would
not
have
him
there
she
would
have
no
one
in
the
house
who
disputed
her
will
she
had
been
an
mother
to
him
and
this
had
been
the
return
made
to
her
she
had
condescended
to
explain
to
him
her
intention
in
regard
to
bessy
and
he
had
immediately
resolved
to
thwart
her
when
she
was
dead
and
gone
it
might
perhaps
be
in
his
power
to
ruin
the
family
if
he
chose
as
to
that
she
would
take
further
thought
but
she
as
long
as
she
lived
would
do
her
duty
i
suppose
i
may
understand
she
said
that
you
will
leave
launay
early
after
breakfast
do
you
mean
to
turn
me
out
of
the
house
i
do
she
said
looking
full
at
him
all
eyes
with
her
grey
hair
coming
dishevelled
from
under
the
large
frill
of
her
nightcap
with
cheeks
gaunt
and
yellow
her
extended
hands
were
very
thin
she
had
been
very
near
death
and
seemed
as
he
gazed
at
her
to
be
very
near
it
now
if
he
went
it
might
be
her
fate
never
to
see
him
again
i
can
not
leave
you
like
this
he
said
then
obey
why
should
we
not
be
married
mother
i
will
not
argue
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
will
you
obey
me
not
in
this
mother
i
could
not
do
so
without
perjuring
then
go
you
out
of
this
house
at
she
was
sitting
now
bolt
upright
on
her
bed
supporting
herself
on
her
hands
behind
her
the
whole
thing
was
so
dreadful
that
he
could
not
endure
to
prolong
the
interview
and
he
left
the
room
then
there
came
a
message
from
the
old
housekeeper
to
bessy
forbidding
her
to
leave
her
own
room
it
was
thus
that
bessy
first
understood
that
her
great
sin
was
to
be
made
public
to
all
the
household
knowl
who
was
the
head
of
the
domestics
had
been
told
and
now
felt
that
a
sort
of
authority
over
bessy
had
been
confided
to
her
no
miss
bessy
you
are
not
to
go
into
her
room
at
all
she
says
that
she
will
not
see
you
till
you
promise
to
be
said
by
but
why
knowl
well
miss
i
suppose
it
s
along
of
philip
but
you
know
that
better
than
me
philip
is
to
go
morning
and
never
come
back
any
never
come
back
to
launay
not
while
things
is
as
they
is
miss
but
you
are
to
stay
here
and
not
go
out
at
all
that
s
what
madam
the
servants
about
the
place
all
called
mrs
miles
madam
there
was
a
potency
about
mrs
miles
which
enabled
her
to
have
her
will
carried
out
although
she
was
lying
ill
in
bed
to
have
her
will
carried
out
as
far
as
the
immediate
severance
of
the
lovers
was
concerned
when
the
command
had
been
brought
by
the
mouth
of
a
servant
bessy
determined
that
she
would
not
see
philip
again
before
he
went
she
understood
that
she
was
bound
by
her
position
bound
by
gratitude
bound
by
a
sense
of
propriety
to
so
much
obedience
as
that
no
earthly
authority
could
be
sufficient
to
make
her
abandon
her
troth
in
that
she
could
not
allow
even
her
aunt
to
sway
her
her
aunt
though
she
were
sick
and
suffering
even
though
she
were
dying
both
her
love
and
her
vow
were
sacred
to
her
but
obedience
at
the
moment
she
did
owe
and
she
kept
her
room
philip
came
to
the
door
but
she
sat
mute
and
would
not
speak
to
him
knowl
when
she
brought
her
some
food
asked
her
whether
she
intended
to
obey
the
order
your
aunt
wants
a
promise
from
you
miss
bessy
i
am
sure
my
aunt
knows
that
i
shall
obey
her
said
bessy
on
the
following
morning
philip
left
the
house
he
sent
a
message
to
his
mother
asking
whether
she
would
see
him
but
she
refused
i
think
you
had
better
not
disturb
her
philip
said
knowl
then
he
went
and
as
the
waggonette
took
him
away
from
the
door
bessy
sat
and
listened
to
the
sound
of
the
wheels
on
the
gravel
all
that
day
and
all
the
next
passed
on
and
she
was
not
allowed
to
see
her
aunt
knowl
repeated
that
she
could
not
take
upon
herself
to
say
that
madam
was
better
no
doubt
the
worry
of
the
last
day
or
two
had
been
a
great
trouble
to
her
knowl
grew
much
in
at
the
time
and
felt
that
she
was
overtopping
miss
bessy
in
the
affairs
of
launay
it
was
no
less
true
than
singular
that
all
the
sympathies
of
the
place
should
be
on
the
side
of
the
old
woman
her
illness
probably
had
something
to
do
with
it
and
then
she
had
been
so
autocratic
all
launay
and
budcombe
had
been
so
accustomed
to
bow
down
to
her
that
rebellion
on
the
part
of
anyone
seemed
to
be
shocking
and
who
was
bessy
pryor
that
she
should
dare
to
think
of
marrying
the
heir
who
even
was
the
supposed
heir
that
he
should
dare
to
think
of
marrying
anyone
in
opposition
to
the
actual
owner
of
the
acres
heir
though
he
was
called
he
was
not
necessarily
the
heir
she
might
do
as
she
pleased
with
all
launay
and
all
budcombe
and
there
were
those
who
thought
that
if
philip
was
still
obstinate
she
would
leave
everything
to
her
elder
son
she
did
not
love
her
elder
son
in
these
days
she
never
saw
him
he
was
a
gay
man
of
the
world
who
had
never
been
dutiful
to
her
but
he
might
take
the
name
of
launay
and
the
family
would
be
perpetuated
as
well
that
way
as
the
other
philip
was
very
foolish
and
as
for
bessy
bessy
was
worse
than
foolish
that
was
the
verdict
of
the
place
generally
i
think
launay
liked
it
the
troubles
of
our
neighbours
are
generally
endurable
and
any
subject
for
conversation
is
a
blessing
launay
liked
the
excitement
but
nevertheless
felt
itself
to
be
compressed
into
whispers
and
a
solemn
demeanour
the
gregory
girls
were
solemn
conscious
of
the
iniquity
of
their
friend
and
deeply
sensitive
of
the
danger
to
which
poor
philip
was
exposed
when
a
rumour
came
to
the
vicarage
that
a
fly
had
been
up
at
the
great
house
it
was
immediately
conceived
that
jones
the
lawyer
from
taunton
had
been
sent
for
with
a
view
to
an
alteration
of
the
will
this
suddenness
this
anger
this
disruption
of
all
things
was
dreadful
but
when
it
was
discovered
that
the
fly
contained
no
one
but
the
doctor
there
was
disappointment
on
the
third
day
there
came
a
message
from
mrs
miles
to
the
rector
would
gregory
step
up
and
see
mrs
miles
then
it
was
thought
at
the
rectory
that
the
dear
old
lady
was
again
worse
and
that
she
had
sent
for
her
clergyman
that
she
might
receive
the
last
comforts
of
religion
but
this
again
was
wrong
mr
gregory
she
said
very
suddenly
i
want
to
consult
you
as
to
a
future
home
for
bessy
must
she
go
from
this
yes
she
must
go
from
this
you
have
heard
perhaps
about
her
and
my
gregory
acknowledged
that
he
had
heard
of
course
she
must
go
i
can
not
have
philip
banished
from
the
house
which
is
to
be
his
own
in
this
matter
he
probably
has
been
the
most
to
they
have
both
perhaps
been
it
is
wickedness
rather
than
folly
but
he
has
been
the
wickeder
it
should
have
been
a
duty
to
him
a
great
duty
and
he
should
have
been
the
stronger
but
he
is
my
son
and
i
can
not
banish
oh
no
but
they
must
not
be
brought
together
i
love
bessy
pryor
dearly
gregory
oh
so
dearly
since
she
came
to
me
now
so
many
years
ago
she
has
been
like
a
gleam
of
sunlight
in
the
house
she
has
always
been
gentle
with
me
the
very
touch
of
her
hand
is
sweet
to
me
but
i
must
not
on
that
account
sacrifice
the
honour
of
the
family
i
have
a
duty
to
do
and
i
must
do
it
though
i
tear
my
heart
in
pieces
where
can
i
send
her
permanently
well
yes
permanently
if
philip
were
married
of
course
she
might
come
back
but
i
will
still
trust
that
she
herself
may
be
married
first
i
do
not
mean
to
cast
her
off
only
she
must
go
anything
that
may
be
wanting
in
money
shall
be
paid
for
her
she
shall
be
provided
for
comfortably
you
know
what
i
had
hoped
about
morrison
perhaps
he
may
even
yet
be
able
to
persuade
her
but
it
must
be
away
from
here
where
can
i
send
her
this
was
a
question
not
very
easy
to
answer
and
gregory
said
that
he
must
take
time
to
think
of
it
mrs
miles
when
she
asked
the
question
was
aware
that
gregory
had
a
maiden
sister
living
at
avranches
in
normandy
who
was
not
in
opulent
circumstances
chapter
vi
how
bessy
pryor
was
to
be
banished
when
a
man
is
asked
by
his
friend
if
he
knows
of
a
horse
to
be
sold
he
does
not
like
immediately
to
suggest
a
transfer
of
the
animal
which
he
has
in
his
own
stable
though
he
may
at
the
moment
be
in
want
of
money
and
anxious
to
sell
his
steed
so
it
was
with
gregory
his
sister
would
be
delighted
to
take
as
a
boarder
a
young
lady
for
whom
liberal
payment
would
be
made
but
at
the
first
moment
he
had
hesitated
to
make
an
offer
by
which
his
own
sister
would
be
benefited
on
the
next
morning
however
he
wrote
as
follows
dear
mrs
miles
my
sister
amelia
is
living
at
avranches
where
she
has
a
pleasant
little
house
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
with
a
garden
an
old
friend
was
living
with
her
but
she
died
last
year
and
my
sister
is
now
alone
if
you
think
that
bessy
would
like
to
sojourn
for
awhile
in
normandy
i
will
write
to
amelia
and
make
the
proposition
bessy
will
find
my
sister
and
faithfully
yours
joshua
mrs
miles
did
not
care
much
for
the
good
temper
and
the
kind
heart
had
she
asked
herself
whether
she
wished
bessy
to
be
happy
she
would
no
doubt
have
answered
herself
in
the
affirmative
she
would
probably
have
done
so
in
regard
to
any
human
being
or
animal
in
the
world
of
course
she
wanted
them
all
to
be
happy
but
happiness
was
to
her
thinking
of
much
less
importance
than
duty
and
at
the
present
moment
her
duty
and
bessy
s
duty
and
philip
s
duty
were
so
momentous
that
no
idea
of
happiness
ought
to
be
considered
in
the
matter
at
all
had
gregory
written
to
say
that
his
sister
was
a
woman
of
severe
morals
of
stern
aspect
prone
to
repress
all
youthful
ebullitions
and
supposed
to
be
disagreeable
because
of
her
temper
all
that
would
have
been
no
obstacle
in
the
present
condition
of
things
suffering
would
be
better
than
happiness
more
in
accord
with
the
feelings
and
position
of
the
person
concerned
it
was
quite
intelligible
to
mrs
miles
that
bessy
should
really
love
philip
almost
to
the
breaking
of
her
heart
quite
intelligible
that
philip
should
have
set
his
mind
upon
the
untoward
marriage
with
all
the
obstinacy
of
a
proud
man
when
young
men
and
young
women
neglect
their
duty
hearts
have
to
be
broken
but
it
is
not
a
soft
and
silken
operation
which
can
be
made
pleasant
by
good
temper
and
social
kindness
it
was
necessary
for
certain
quite
adequate
reasons
that
bessy
should
be
put
on
the
wheel
and
be
racked
and
tormented
to
talk
to
her
of
the
good
temper
of
the
old
woman
who
would
have
to
turn
the
wheel
would
be
to
lie
to
her
mrs
miles
did
not
want
her
to
think
that
things
could
be
made
pleasant
for
her
soon
after
the
receipt
of
gregory
s
letter
she
sent
for
bessy
who
was
then
brought
into
the
room
under
the
guard
as
it
were
of
knowl
knowl
accompanied
her
along
the
corridor
which
was
surely
unnecessary
as
bessy
s
door
had
not
been
locked
upon
her
her
imprisonment
had
only
come
from
obedience
but
knowl
felt
that
a
great
trust
had
been
confided
to
her
and
was
anxious
to
omit
none
of
her
duties
she
opened
the
door
so
that
the
invalid
on
the
bed
could
see
that
this
duty
had
been
done
and
then
bessy
crept
into
the
room
she
crept
in
but
very
quickly
and
in
a
moment
had
her
arms
round
the
old
woman
s
back
and
her
lips
pressed
to
the
old
woman
s
forehead
why
may
not
i
come
and
be
with
you
she
said
because
you
are
no
no
i
do
all
that
you
tell
me
i
have
not
stirred
from
my
room
though
it
was
hard
to
think
you
were
ill
so
near
me
and
that
i
could
do
nothing
i
did
not
try
to
say
a
word
to
him
or
even
to
look
at
him
and
now
that
he
has
gone
why
should
i
not
be
with
you
it
can
not
but
why
not
aunt
even
though
you
would
not
speak
to
me
i
could
be
with
you
who
is
there
to
read
to
you
there
is
no
one
of
course
it
is
dreary
but
there
are
worse
things
than
why
should
not
i
come
back
now
that
he
has
gone
she
still
had
her
arm
round
the
old
woman
s
back
and
had
now
succeeded
in
dragging
herself
on
to
the
bed
and
in
crouching
down
by
her
aunt
s
side
it
was
her
perseverance
in
this
fashion
that
had
so
often
forced
mrs
miles
out
of
her
own
ordained
method
of
life
and
compelled
her
to
leave
for
a
moment
the
strictness
which
was
congenial
to
her
it
was
this
that
had
made
her
declare
to
gregory
in
the
midst
of
her
severity
that
bessy
had
been
like
a
gleam
of
sunshine
in
the
house
even
now
she
knew
not
how
to
escape
from
the
softness
of
an
embrace
which
was
in
truth
so
grateful
to
her
it
was
a
consciousness
of
this
of
the
potency
of
bessy
s
charm
even
over
herself
which
had
made
her
hasten
to
send
her
away
from
her
bessy
would
read
to
her
all
the
day
would
hold
her
hand
when
she
was
half
dozing
would
assist
in
every
movement
with
all
the
patience
and
much
more
than
the
tenderness
of
a
there
was
no
voice
so
sweet
no
hand
so
cool
no
memory
so
mindful
no
step
so
soft
as
bessy
s
and
now
bessy
was
there
lying
on
her
bed
caressing
her
more
closely
bound
to
her
than
had
ever
been
any
other
being
in
the
world
and
yet
bessy
was
an
enemy
from
whom
it
was
imperatively
necessary
that
she
should
be
divided
get
down
bessy
she
said
go
off
from
no
no
no
said
bessy
still
clinging
to
her
and
kissing
her
i
have
that
to
say
to
you
which
must
be
said
i
am
calm
quite
calm
i
will
do
whatever
you
tell
me
only
pray
pray
do
not
send
me
away
from
you
say
that
you
will
obey
i
will
i
have
i
always
have
obeyed
will
you
give
up
your
love
for
philip
could
i
give
up
my
love
for
you
if
anybody
told
me
how
can
i
do
it
love
comes
of
itself
i
did
not
try
to
love
him
oh
if
you
could
know
how
i
tried
not
to
love
him
if
somebody
came
and
said
i
was
not
to
love
you
would
it
be
possible
i
am
speaking
of
another
yes
i
know
one
is
a
kind
of
love
that
is
always
welcome
the
other
comes
first
as
a
shock
and
one
struggles
to
avoid
it
but
when
it
has
come
how
can
it
be
helped
i
do
love
him
better
than
all
the
as
she
said
this
she
raised
herself
upon
the
bed
so
as
to
look
round
upon
her
aunt
s
face
but
still
she
kept
her
arm
upon
the
old
woman
s
shoulder
is
it
not
natural
how
could
i
have
helped
it
you
must
have
known
that
it
was
no
you
did
not
know
that
it
would
displease
me
i
knew
that
it
was
unfortunate
not
wrong
what
did
i
do
that
was
wrong
when
he
asked
me
could
i
tell
him
anything
but
the
truth
you
should
have
told
him
at
this
reply
bessy
shook
her
head
it
can
not
be
that
you
should
think
that
in
such
a
matter
there
should
be
no
restraint
did
you
expect
that
i
should
give
my
consent
to
such
a
marriage
i
want
to
hear
from
yourself
what
you
thought
of
my
i
knew
you
would
be
well
i
knew
you
must
think
me
unfit
to
be
philip
s
well
i
knew
that
you
wanted
something
else
for
him
and
something
else
also
for
and
did
such
knowledge
go
for
nothing
it
made
me
feel
that
my
love
was
unfortunate
but
not
that
it
was
wrong
i
could
not
help
it
he
had
come
to
me
and
i
loved
him
the
other
man
came
and
i
could
not
love
him
why
should
i
be
shut
up
for
this
in
my
own
room
why
should
i
be
sent
away
from
you
to
be
miserable
because
i
know
that
you
want
things
done
he
is
not
here
if
he
were
here
and
you
bade
me
not
to
go
near
him
i
would
not
go
though
he
were
in
the
next
room
i
would
not
see
him
i
would
obey
you
altogether
but
i
must
love
him
and
as
i
love
him
i
can
not
love
another
you
would
not
wish
me
to
marry
a
man
when
my
heart
has
been
given
to
the
old
woman
had
not
at
all
intended
that
there
should
be
such
arguments
as
these
it
had
been
her
purpose
simply
to
communicate
her
plan
to
tell
bessy
that
she
would
have
to
live
probably
for
a
few
years
at
avranches
and
then
to
send
her
back
to
her
prison
but
bessy
had
again
got
the
best
of
her
and
then
had
come
caressing
talking
and
excuses
bessy
had
been
nearly
an
hour
in
her
room
before
mrs
miles
had
disclosed
her
purpose
and
had
hovered
round
her
aunt
doing
as
had
been
her
wont
when
she
was
recognised
as
having
all
the
powers
of
head
nurse
in
her
hands
then
at
last
in
a
manner
very
different
from
that
which
had
been
planned
mrs
miles
proposed
the
normandy
scheme
she
had
been
involuntarily
so
much
softened
that
she
condescended
even
to
repeat
what
gregory
had
said
as
to
the
good
temper
and
general
kindness
of
his
maiden
sister
but
why
should
i
go
asked
bessy
almost
sobbing
i
wonder
that
you
should
he
is
not
but
he
may
if
he
came
ever
so
i
would
not
see
him
if
you
bade
me
not
i
think
you
hardly
understand
me
aunt
i
will
obey
you
in
everything
i
am
sure
you
will
not
now
ask
me
to
marry
she
could
not
say
that
philip
would
be
more
likely
to
become
amenable
and
marry
the
cornish
heiress
if
bessy
were
away
at
avranches
than
if
she
still
remained
shut
up
at
launay
but
that
was
her
feeling
philip
she
knew
would
be
less
obedient
than
bessy
but
then
too
philip
might
be
less
obstinate
of
purpose
you
can
not
live
here
bessy
unless
you
will
say
that
you
will
never
become
the
wife
of
my
never
never
i
can
not
say
there
was
a
long
pause
before
she
found
the
courage
to
pronounce
these
words
but
she
did
pronounce
them
at
last
then
you
must
i
may
stay
and
nurse
you
till
you
are
well
let
me
do
that
i
will
go
whenever
you
may
bid
no
there
shall
be
no
terms
between
us
we
must
be
friends
bessy
or
we
must
be
enemies
we
can
not
be
friends
as
long
as
you
hold
yourself
to
be
engaged
to
philip
launay
while
that
is
so
i
will
not
take
a
cup
of
water
from
your
hands
no
no
for
the
girl
was
again
trying
to
embrace
her
i
will
not
have
your
love
nor
shall
you
have
my
heart
would
break
were
i
to
say
then
let
it
break
is
my
heart
not
broken
what
is
it
though
our
hearts
do
break
what
is
it
though
we
die
if
we
do
our
duty
you
owe
this
for
what
i
have
done
for
i
owe
you
then
say
that
you
will
give
him
i
owe
you
everything
except
this
i
will
not
speak
to
him
i
will
not
write
to
him
i
will
not
even
look
at
him
but
i
will
not
give
him
up
when
one
loves
one
can
not
give
it
then
she
was
ordered
to
go
back
to
her
room
and
back
to
her
room
she
went
chapter
vii
how
bessy
pryor
was
banished
to
normandy
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
go
after
the
interview
described
in
the
last
chapter
mrs
miles
sent
a
message
to
the
obstinate
girl
informing
her
that
she
need
not
any
longer
consider
herself
as
a
prisoner
but
that
she
had
better
prepare
her
clothes
so
as
to
be
ready
to
start
within
a
week
the
necessary
correspondence
had
taken
place
between
launay
and
avranches
and
within
ten
days
from
the
time
at
which
gregory
had
made
the
proposition
in
less
than
a
fortnight
from
the
departure
of
her
lover
bessy
came
down
from
her
room
all
equipped
and
took
her
place
in
the
same
waggonette
which
so
short
a
time
before
had
taken
her
lover
away
from
her
during
the
week
she
had
had
liberty
to
go
where
she
pleased
except
into
her
aunt
s
room
but
she
had
in
truth
been
almost
as
much
a
prisoner
as
before
she
did
for
a
few
minutes
each
day
go
out
into
the
garden
but
she
would
not
go
beyond
the
garden
into
the
park
nor
did
she
accept
an
invitation
from
the
gregory
girls
to
spend
an
evening
at
the
rectory
it
would
be
so
necessary
one
of
them
wrote
that
everything
should
be
told
to
her
as
to
the
disposition
and
ways
of
life
of
aunt
amelia
but
bessy
would
not
see
the
gregory
girls
she
was
being
sent
away
from
home
because
of
the
wickedness
of
her
love
and
all
launay
knew
it
in
such
a
condition
of
things
she
could
not
go
out
to
eat
and
and
to
be
told
of
the
delights
of
a
small
norman
town
she
would
not
even
see
the
gregory
girls
when
they
came
up
to
the
house
but
wrote
an
affectionate
note
to
the
elder
of
them
explaining
that
her
misery
was
too
great
to
allow
her
to
see
any
friend
she
was
in
truth
very
miserable
it
was
not
only
because
of
her
love
from
which
she
had
from
the
first
been
aware
that
misery
must
come
undoubted
misery
if
not
misery
that
would
last
through
her
whole
life
but
now
there
was
added
to
this
the
sorrow
of
absolute
banishment
from
her
aunt
mrs
miles
would
not
see
her
again
before
she
started
bessy
was
well
aware
of
all
that
she
owed
to
the
mistress
of
launay
and
being
intelligent
in
the
reading
of
character
was
aware
also
that
through
many
years
she
had
succeeded
in
obtaining
from
the
old
woman
more
than
the
intended
performance
of
an
undertaken
duty
she
had
forced
the
old
woman
to
love
her
and
was
aware
that
by
means
of
that
love
the
old
woman
s
life
had
been
brightened
she
had
not
only
received
but
had
conferred
kindness
and
it
is
by
conferring
kindness
that
love
is
created
it
was
an
agony
to
her
that
she
should
be
compelled
to
leave
this
dearest
friend
who
was
still
sick
and
infirm
without
seeing
her
but
mrs
miles
was
inexorable
these
four
words
written
on
a
scrap
of
paper
were
brought
to
her
on
that
morning
pray
pray
see
me
she
was
still
inexorable
there
had
been
long
notes
between
them
on
the
previous
day
if
bessy
would
pledge
herself
to
give
up
her
lover
all
might
yet
be
changed
the
old
woman
at
avranches
should
be
compensated
for
her
disappointment
bessy
should
be
restored
to
all
her
privileges
at
launay
you
shall
be
my
own
own
child
said
mrs
miles
she
condescended
even
to
promise
that
not
a
word
more
should
be
said
about
morrison
but
bessy
also
could
be
inexorable
i
can
not
say
that
i
will
give
him
up
she
wrote
thus
it
came
to
pass
that
she
had
to
get
into
the
waggonette
without
seeing
her
old
friend
knowl
went
with
her
having
received
instructions
to
wait
upon
miss
bessy
all
the
way
to
avranches
knowl
felt
that
she
was
sent
as
a
guard
against
the
lover
mrs
miles
had
known
bessy
too
well
to
have
fear
of
that
kind
and
had
sent
knowl
as
general
guardian
against
the
wild
beasts
which
are
supposed
to
be
roaming
about
the
world
in
quest
of
unprotected
young
females
in
the
distribution
of
her
anger
mrs
miles
had
for
the
moment
been
very
severe
towards
philip
as
to
pecuniary
matters
he
had
chosen
to
be
rebellious
and
therefore
he
was
not
only
turned
out
of
the
house
but
told
that
he
must
live
on
an
uncomfortably
small
income
but
to
bessy
mrs
miles
was
liberal
she
had
astounded
miss
gregory
by
the
nobility
of
the
terms
she
had
proposed
and
on
the
evening
before
the
journey
had
sent
ten
notes
in
a
blank
envelope
to
bessy
then
in
a
subsequent
note
she
had
said
that
a
similar
sum
would
be
paid
to
her
every
in
none
of
these
notes
was
there
any
expression
of
endearment
to
none
of
them
was
there
even
a
signature
but
they
all
conveyed
evidence
of
the
amount
of
thought
which
mrs
miles
was
giving
to
bessy
and
her
affairs
bessy
s
journey
was
very
comfortless
she
had
learned
to
hate
knowl
who
assumed
all
the
airs
of
a
duenna
she
would
not
leave
bessy
out
of
sight
for
a
moment
as
though
philip
might
have
been
hidden
behind
every
curtain
or
under
every
table
once
or
twice
the
duenna
made
a
little
attempt
at
persuasion
herself
it
ain
t
no
good
miss
and
it
had
better
be
give
then
bessy
looked
at
her
and
desired
that
she
might
be
left
alone
this
had
been
at
the
hotel
at
dover
then
again
knowl
spoke
as
the
carriage
was
approaching
avranches
if
you
wish
to
come
back
miss
bessy
the
way
is
never
mind
my
wishes
knowl
said
bessy
when
on
her
return
to
launay
knowl
once
attempted
to
intimate
to
her
mistress
that
miss
bessy
was
very
obstinate
she
was
silenced
so
sternly
so
shortly
that
the
housekeeper
began
to
doubt
whether
she
might
not
have
made
a
mistake
and
whether
bessy
would
not
at
last
prevail
it
was
evident
that
mrs
miles
would
not
hear
a
word
against
bessy
on
her
arrival
at
avranches
miss
gregory
was
very
kind
to
her
she
found
that
she
was
received
not
at
all
as
a
naughty
girl
who
had
been
sent
away
from
home
in
order
that
she
might
be
subjected
to
severe
treatment
miss
gregory
fulfilled
all
the
promises
which
her
brother
had
made
on
her
behalf
and
was
thoroughly
kind
and
for
nearly
a
month
not
a
word
was
said
about
philip
or
the
love
affairs
it
seemed
to
be
understood
that
bessy
had
come
to
avranches
quite
at
her
own
desire
she
was
introduced
to
the
genteel
society
with
which
that
place
abounds
and
was
conscious
that
a
much
freer
life
was
vouchsafed
to
her
than
she
had
ever
known
before
at
launay
she
had
of
course
been
subject
to
mrs
miles
now
she
was
subject
to
no
one
miss
gregory
exercised
no
authority
over
her
was
indeed
rather
subject
to
bessy
as
being
recipient
of
the
money
paid
for
bessy
s
board
and
lodging
but
by
the
end
of
the
month
there
had
grown
up
so
much
of
friendship
between
the
elder
and
the
younger
lady
that
something
came
to
be
said
about
philip
it
was
impossible
that
bessy
should
be
silent
as
to
her
past
life
by
degrees
she
told
all
that
mrs
miles
had
done
for
her
how
she
herself
had
been
a
penniless
orphan
how
mrs
miles
had
taken
her
in
from
simple
charity
how
love
had
grown
up
between
them
two
the
warmest
truest
love
and
then
how
that
other
love
had
grown
the
telling
of
secrets
begets
the
telling
of
secrets
miss
gregory
though
she
was
now
old
with
the
marks
of
little
feeble
crow
round
her
gentle
eyes
though
she
wore
a
false
front
and
was
much
withered
had
also
had
her
love
affair
she
took
delight
in
pouring
forth
her
little
tale
how
she
had
loved
an
officer
and
had
been
beloved
how
there
had
been
no
money
how
the
officer
s
parents
had
besought
her
to
set
the
officer
free
so
that
he
might
marry
money
how
she
had
set
the
officer
free
and
how
in
consequence
the
officer
had
married
money
and
was
now
a
with
a
large
family
a
comfortable
house
and
the
gout
and
i
have
always
thought
it
was
right
said
the
excellent
spinster
what
could
i
have
done
for
him
it
couldn
t
be
right
if
he
loved
you
best
said
bessy
why
not
my
dear
he
has
made
an
excellent
husband
perhaps
he
didn
t
love
me
best
when
he
stood
at
the
i
think
love
should
be
more
mine
has
been
very
holy
to
me
myself
for
a
time
i
wept
but
now
i
think
i
am
happier
than
if
i
had
never
seen
him
it
adds
something
to
one
s
life
to
have
been
loved
bessy
who
was
of
a
stronger
temperament
told
herself
that
happiness
such
as
that
would
not
suffice
for
her
she
wanted
not
only
to
be
happy
herself
but
also
to
make
him
so
in
the
simplicity
of
her
heart
she
wondered
whether
philip
would
be
different
from
that
but
in
the
strength
of
her
heart
she
was
sure
he
would
be
very
different
she
would
certainly
not
release
him
at
the
request
of
any
parent
but
he
should
be
free
as
air
at
the
slightest
hint
of
a
request
from
himself
she
did
not
believe
for
a
moment
that
such
a
request
would
come
but
if
it
did
if
it
did
then
there
should
be
no
difficulty
then
would
she
submit
to
banishment
at
avranches
or
elsewhere
as
it
might
be
decided
for
her
till
it
might
please
the
lord
to
release
her
from
her
troubles
at
the
end
of
six
weeks
miss
gregory
knew
the
whole
secret
of
philip
and
bessy
s
love
and
knew
also
that
bessy
was
quite
resolved
to
persevere
there
were
many
discussions
about
love
in
which
bessy
always
clung
to
the
opinion
that
when
it
was
once
offered
and
taken
given
and
received
it
ought
to
be
held
as
more
sacred
than
any
other
bond
she
owed
much
to
mrs
miles
she
acknowledged
that
but
she
thought
that
she
owed
more
to
philip
miss
gregory
would
never
quite
agree
with
her
was
strong
in
her
own
opinion
that
women
are
born
to
yield
and
suffer
and
live
mutilated
lives
like
herself
but
not
the
less
did
they
become
fast
friends
at
the
end
of
six
weeks
it
was
determined
between
them
that
bessy
should
write
to
mrs
miles
mrs
miles
had
signified
her
wish
not
to
be
written
to
and
had
not
herself
written
messages
as
to
the
improving
state
of
her
health
had
come
from
the
gregory
girls
but
no
letter
had
as
yet
passed
then
bessy
wrote
as
follows
in
direct
disobedience
to
her
aunt
s
orders
dearest
aunt
i
can
not
help
writing
a
line
because
i
am
so
anxious
about
you
mary
gregory
says
you
have
been
up
and
out
on
the
lawn
in
the
sunshine
but
it
would
make
me
so
happy
if
i
could
see
the
words
in
your
own
dear
handwriting
do
send
me
one
little
word
and
though
i
know
what
you
told
me
still
i
think
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
that
your
poor
affectionate
loving
bessy
is
well
i
will
not
say
that
i
am
quite
happy
i
can
not
be
quite
happy
away
from
launay
and
you
but
miss
gregory
has
been
very
very
kind
to
me
and
there
are
nice
people
here
we
live
almost
as
quietly
as
at
launay
but
sometimes
we
see
the
people
i
am
reading
german
and
making
lace
and
i
try
not
to
be
idle
dear
dearest
aunt
try
to
think
kindly
of
me
i
pray
for
you
every
morning
and
night
if
you
will
send
me
a
little
note
from
yourself
it
will
fill
me
with
your
most
affectionate
and
devoted
niece
bessy
this
was
brought
up
to
mrs
miles
when
she
was
still
in
bed
for
as
yet
she
had
not
returned
to
the
early
hours
of
her
healthy
life
when
she
had
read
it
she
at
first
held
it
apart
from
her
then
she
put
it
close
to
her
bosom
and
wept
bitterly
as
she
thought
how
void
of
sunshine
the
house
had
been
since
that
gleam
had
been
turned
away
from
it
chapter
viii
how
bessy
pryor
received
two
letters
from
launay
the
same
post
brought
bessy
two
letters
from
england
about
the
middle
of
august
both
of
which
the
reader
shall
see
but
first
shall
be
given
that
which
bessy
read
the
last
it
was
from
mrs
miles
and
had
been
sent
when
she
was
beginning
to
think
that
her
aunt
was
still
resolved
not
to
write
to
her
the
letter
was
as
follows
and
was
written
on
square
paper
which
in
these
days
is
only
used
even
by
the
when
the
letter
to
be
sent
is
supposed
to
be
one
of
great
importance
my
dear
bessy
though
i
had
told
you
not
to
write
to
me
still
i
am
glad
to
hear
that
you
are
well
and
that
your
new
home
has
been
made
as
comfortable
for
you
as
circumstances
will
permit
launay
has
not
been
comfortable
since
you
went
i
miss
you
very
much
you
have
become
so
dear
to
me
that
my
life
is
sad
without
you
my
days
have
never
been
bright
but
now
they
are
less
so
than
ever
i
should
scruple
to
admit
so
much
as
this
to
you
were
it
not
that
i
intend
it
as
a
prelude
to
that
which
will
follow
we
have
been
sent
into
this
world
my
child
that
we
may
do
our
duties
independent
of
that
fleeting
feeling
which
we
call
happiness
in
the
smaller
affairs
of
life
i
am
sure
you
would
never
seek
a
pleasure
at
the
cost
of
your
conscience
if
not
in
the
smaller
things
then
certainly
should
you
not
do
so
in
the
greater
to
deny
yourself
to
remember
the
welfare
of
others
when
temptation
is
urging
you
to
do
wrong
then
do
that
which
you
know
to
be
right
that
is
your
duty
as
a
christian
and
especially
your
duty
as
a
woman
to
sacrifice
herself
is
the
special
heroism
which
a
woman
can
achieve
men
who
are
called
upon
to
work
may
gratify
their
passions
and
still
be
heroes
a
woman
can
soar
only
by
suffering
you
will
understand
why
i
tell
you
this
i
and
my
son
have
been
born
into
a
special
degree
of
life
which
i
think
it
to
be
my
duty
and
his
to
maintain
it
is
not
that
i
or
that
he
may
enjoy
any
special
delights
that
i
hold
fast
to
this
opinion
but
that
i
may
do
my
part
towards
maintaining
that
order
of
things
which
has
made
my
country
more
blessed
than
others
it
would
take
me
long
to
explain
all
this
but
i
know
you
will
believe
me
when
i
say
that
an
imperative
sense
of
duty
is
my
guide
you
have
not
been
born
into
that
degree
that
this
does
not
affect
my
own
personal
feeling
to
you
you
must
know
you
have
had
many
signs
how
dear
you
are
to
me
at
this
moment
my
days
are
heavy
to
bear
because
i
have
not
my
bessy
with
me
my
bessy
who
has
been
so
good
to
me
so
loving
such
an
infinite
blessing
that
to
see
the
hem
of
her
garments
to
hear
the
sound
of
her
foot
has
made
things
bright
around
me
now
there
is
nothing
to
see
nothing
to
hear
that
is
not
unsightly
and
harsh
of
sound
oh
bessy
if
you
could
come
back
to
me
but
i
have
to
do
that
duty
of
which
i
have
spoken
and
i
shall
do
it
though
i
were
never
to
see
you
again
i
shall
do
it
i
am
used
to
suffering
and
sometimes
think
it
wrong
even
to
wish
that
you
were
back
with
me
but
i
write
to
you
thus
that
you
may
understand
everything
if
you
will
say
that
you
will
give
him
up
you
shall
return
to
me
and
be
my
own
own
beloved
child
i
tell
you
that
you
are
not
of
the
same
degree
i
am
bound
to
tell
you
so
but
you
shall
be
so
near
my
heart
that
nothing
shall
separate
us
you
two
can
not
marry
while
i
am
living
i
do
not
think
it
possible
that
you
should
be
longing
to
be
made
happy
by
my
death
and
you
should
remember
that
he
can
not
be
the
first
to
break
away
from
this
foolish
engagement
without
dishonour
as
he
is
the
wealthy
one
and
the
higher
born
and
as
he
is
the
man
he
ought
not
to
be
the
first
to
say
the
word
you
may
say
it
without
falsehood
and
without
disgrace
you
may
say
it
and
all
the
world
will
know
that
you
have
been
actuated
only
by
a
sense
of
duty
it
will
be
acknowledged
that
you
have
sacrificed
yourself
as
it
becomes
a
woman
to
do
one
word
from
you
will
be
enough
to
assure
me
since
you
came
to
me
you
have
never
been
false
one
word
and
you
shall
come
back
to
me
and
to
launay
my
friend
and
my
treasure
if
it
be
that
there
must
be
suffering
we
will
suffer
together
if
tears
are
necessary
there
shall
be
joint
tears
though
i
am
old
still
i
can
understand
i
will
acknowledge
the
sacrifice
but
bessy
my
bessy
dearest
bessy
the
sacrifice
must
be
made
of
course
he
must
live
away
from
launay
for
awhile
the
fault
will
have
been
his
and
what
of
inconvenience
there
may
be
he
must
undergo
he
shall
not
come
here
till
you
yourself
shall
say
that
you
can
bear
his
presence
without
an
added
sorrow
i
know
you
will
not
let
this
letter
be
in
vain
i
know
you
will
think
it
over
deeply
and
that
you
will
not
keep
me
too
long
waiting
for
an
answer
i
need
hardly
tell
you
that
i
am
your
most
loving
friend
when
bessy
was
reading
this
when
the
strong
words
with
which
her
aunt
had
pleaded
her
cause
were
harrowing
her
heart
she
had
clasped
in
her
hand
this
other
letter
from
her
lover
this
too
was
written
from
launay
my
own
dearest
bessy
it
is
absolutely
only
now
that
i
have
found
out
where
you
are
and
have
done
so
simply
because
the
people
at
the
rectory
could
not
keep
the
secret
can
anything
be
more
absurd
than
supposing
that
my
mother
can
have
her
way
by
whisking
you
away
and
shutting
you
up
in
normandy
it
is
too
foolish
she
has
sent
for
me
and
i
have
come
like
a
dutiful
son
i
have
indeed
been
rejoiced
to
see
her
looking
again
so
much
like
herself
but
i
have
not
extended
my
duty
to
obeying
her
in
a
matter
in
which
my
own
future
happiness
is
altogether
bound
up
and
in
which
perhaps
the
happiness
of
another
person
may
be
slightly
concerned
i
have
told
her
that
i
would
venture
to
say
nothing
of
the
happiness
of
the
other
person
the
other
person
might
be
indifferent
though
i
did
not
believe
it
was
so
but
i
was
quite
sure
of
my
own
i
have
assured
her
that
i
know
what
i
want
myself
and
that
i
do
not
mean
to
abandon
my
hope
of
achieving
it
i
know
that
she
is
writing
to
you
she
can
of
course
say
what
she
pleases
the
idea
of
separating
two
people
who
are
as
old
as
you
and
i
and
who
completely
know
our
own
minds
you
see
that
i
do
not
really
doubt
as
to
yours
is
about
as
foolish
as
anything
well
can
be
it
is
as
though
we
were
going
back
half
a
dozen
centuries
into
the
tyrannies
of
the
middle
ages
my
object
shall
be
to
induce
her
to
let
you
come
home
and
be
married
properly
from
launay
if
she
will
not
consent
by
the
end
of
this
month
i
shall
go
over
to
you
and
we
must
contrive
to
be
married
at
avranches
when
the
thing
has
been
once
done
all
this
rubbish
will
be
swept
away
i
do
not
believe
for
a
moment
that
my
mother
will
punish
us
by
any
injustice
as
to
money
write
and
tell
me
that
you
agree
with
me
and
be
sure
that
i
shall
remain
as
i
am
always
altogether
your
own
truly
and
affectionately
philip
when
bessy
pryor
began
to
consider
these
two
letters
together
she
felt
that
the
task
was
almost
too
much
for
her
her
lover
s
letter
had
been
the
first
read
she
had
known
his
handwriting
and
of
course
had
read
his
the
first
and
as
she
had
read
it
everything
seemed
to
be
of
rose
colour
of
course
she
had
been
filled
with
joy
something
had
been
done
by
the
warnings
of
miss
gregory
something
but
not
much
to
weaken
her
strong
faith
in
her
lover
the
had
been
worldly
and
untrue
and
it
had
been
possible
that
her
philip
should
be
as
had
been
the
there
had
been
moments
of
doubt
in
which
her
heart
had
fainted
a
little
but
as
she
read
her
lover
s
words
she
acknowledged
to
herself
how
wrong
she
had
been
to
faint
at
all
he
declared
it
to
be
a
matter
in
which
his
own
future
happiness
was
altogether
bound
and
then
there
had
been
his
playful
allusion
to
her
happiness
which
was
not
the
less
pleasant
to
her
because
he
had
pretended
to
think
that
the
other
person
might
be
she
pouted
her
lips
at
him
as
though
he
were
present
while
she
was
reading
with
a
joyous
affectation
of
disdain
no
no
she
could
not
consent
to
an
immediate
marriage
at
avranches
there
must
be
some
delay
but
she
would
write
to
him
and
explain
all
that
then
she
read
her
aunt
s
letter
it
moved
her
very
much
she
had
read
it
all
twice
before
there
came
upon
her
a
feeling
of
doubt
an
acknowledgment
to
herself
that
she
must
reconsider
the
matter
but
even
when
she
was
only
reading
it
before
she
had
begun
to
consider
her
former
joy
was
repressed
and
almost
quenched
so
much
of
it
was
too
true
terribly
true
of
course
her
duty
should
be
paramount
if
she
could
persuade
herself
that
duty
required
her
to
abandon
philip
she
must
abandon
him
let
the
suffering
to
herself
or
to
others
be
what
it
might
but
then
what
was
it
that
duty
required
of
her
to
sacrifice
herself
is
the
special
heroism
which
a
woman
can
yes
she
believed
that
but
then
how
about
sacrificing
philip
who
no
doubt
was
telling
the
truth
when
he
said
that
his
own
happiness
was
altogether
bound
up
in
his
love
she
was
moved
too
by
all
that
which
mrs
miles
said
as
to
the
grandeur
of
the
launay
family
she
had
learned
enough
of
the
manners
of
launay
to
be
quite
alive
to
the
aristocratic
idiosyncrasies
of
the
old
woman
she
bessy
pryor
was
nobody
it
would
have
been
well
that
philip
launay
should
have
founded
his
happiness
on
some
girl
of
higher
birth
but
he
had
not
done
so
king
cophetua
s
marriage
had
been
recognised
by
the
world
at
large
philip
was
no
more
than
king
cophetua
nor
was
she
less
than
the
like
to
like
in
marriages
was
no
doubt
expedient
but
not
indispensable
and
though
she
was
not
philip
s
equal
yet
she
was
a
lady
she
would
not
disgrace
him
at
his
table
or
among
his
friends
she
was
sure
that
she
could
be
a
comfort
to
him
in
his
work
but
the
parts
of
the
old
woman
s
letter
which
moved
her
most
were
those
in
which
she
gave
full
play
to
her
own
heart
and
spoke
without
reserve
of
her
own
love
for
her
dearest
bessy
my
days
are
heavy
to
bear
because
i
have
not
my
bessy
with
it
was
impossible
to
read
this
and
not
to
have
some
desire
to
yield
how
good
this
lady
had
been
to
her
was
it
not
through
her
that
she
had
known
philip
but
for
mrs
miles
what
would
her
own
life
have
been
she
thought
that
had
she
been
sure
of
philip
s
happiness
could
she
have
satisfied
herself
that
he
would
bear
the
blow
she
would
have
done
as
she
was
asked
she
would
have
achieved
her
heroism
and
shown
the
strength
of
her
gratitude
and
would
have
taken
her
delight
in
administering
to
the
comforts
of
her
old
friend
only
that
philip
had
her
promise
all
that
she
could
possibly
owe
to
all
the
world
beside
must
be
less
so
infinitely
less
than
what
she
owed
to
him
she
would
have
consulted
miss
gregory
but
she
knew
so
well
what
miss
gregory
would
have
advised
miss
gregory
would
only
have
mentioned
the
and
her
own
experiences
bessy
determined
therefore
to
lie
awake
and
think
of
it
and
to
take
no
other
counsellor
beyond
her
own
heart
chapter
ix
how
bessy
pryor
answered
the
two
letters
and
what
came
of
it
the
letters
were
read
very
often
and
that
from
mrs
miles
i
think
the
oftener
philip
s
love
was
plainly
expressed
and
what
more
is
expected
from
a
lover
s
letter
than
a
strong
manly
expression
of
love
it
was
quite
satisfactory
declaring
the
one
important
fact
that
his
happiness
was
bound
up
in
hers
but
miles
was
the
stronger
letter
and
by
far
the
more
suggestive
she
had
so
mingled
hardness
and
softness
had
enveloped
her
stern
lesson
of
feminine
duty
in
so
sweet
a
frame
of
personal
love
that
it
was
hardly
possible
that
such
a
girl
as
bessy
pryor
should
not
be
shaken
by
her
arguments
there
were
moments
during
the
night
in
which
she
had
almost
resolved
to
yield
a
woman
can
soar
only
by
she
was
not
sure
that
she
wanted
to
soar
but
she
certainly
did
want
to
do
her
duty
even
though
suffering
should
come
of
it
but
there
was
one
word
in
her
aunt
s
letter
which
militated
against
the
writer
s
purpose
rather
than
assisted
it
since
you
first
came
to
me
you
have
never
been
false
no
she
hoped
she
had
not
been
false
whatever
might
be
the
duty
of
a
man
or
a
woman
that
duty
should
be
founded
on
truth
was
it
not
her
special
duty
at
this
moment
to
be
true
to
philip
i
do
not
know
that
she
was
altogether
logical
i
do
not
know
but
that
in
so
supporting
herself
in
her
love
there
may
have
been
a
bias
of
personal
inclination
bessy
perhaps
was
a
little
prone
to
think
that
her
delight
and
her
duty
went
together
but
that
flattering
assurance
that
she
had
never
yet
been
false
strengthened
her
resolution
to
be
true
now
to
philip
she
took
the
whole
of
the
next
day
to
think
abstaining
during
the
whole
day
from
a
word
of
confidential
conversation
with
miss
gregory
then
on
the
following
morning
she
wrote
her
letters
that
to
philip
would
be
easily
written
words
come
readily
when
one
has
to
give
a
hearty
assent
to
an
eager
and
welcome
proposition
but
to
deny
to
make
denial
to
one
loved
and
respected
to
make
denial
of
that
which
the
loved
one
has
a
right
to
ask
must
be
difficult
bessy
like
a
brave
girl
went
to
the
hard
task
first
and
she
rushed
instantly
at
her
subject
as
a
brave
horseman
rides
at
his
fence
without
craning
dearest
aunt
i
can
not
do
as
you
bid
me
my
word
to
him
is
so
sacred
to
me
that
i
do
not
dare
to
break
it
i
can
not
say
that
i
won
t
be
his
when
i
feel
that
i
have
already
given
myself
to
him
dear
dearest
aunt
my
heart
is
very
sad
as
i
write
this
because
i
feel
that
i
am
separating
myself
from
you
almost
for
ever
you
know
that
i
love
you
you
know
that
i
am
miserable
because
you
have
banished
me
from
your
side
all
the
sweet
kind
words
of
your
love
to
me
are
like
daggers
to
me
because
i
can
not
show
my
gratitude
by
doing
as
you
would
have
me
it
seems
so
hard
i
know
it
is
probable
that
i
may
never
see
him
again
and
yet
i
am
to
be
separated
from
you
and
you
will
be
my
enemy
in
all
the
world
there
are
but
two
that
i
really
love
though
i
can
not
and
will
not
give
him
up
i
desire
to
be
back
at
launay
now
only
that
i
might
be
with
you
my
love
for
him
would
be
contented
with
a
simple
permission
that
it
should
exist
my
love
for
you
can
not
be
satisfied
unless
i
am
allowed
to
be
close
to
you
once
again
you
say
that
a
woman
s
duty
consists
in
suffering
i
am
striving
to
do
my
duty
but
i
know
how
great
is
my
suffering
in
doing
it
however
angry
you
may
be
with
your
bessy
you
will
not
think
that
she
can
appear
even
to
be
ungrateful
without
a
pang
though
i
will
not
give
him
up
you
need
not
fear
that
i
shall
do
anything
should
he
come
here
i
could
not
i
suppose
avoid
seeing
him
but
i
should
ask
him
to
go
at
once
and
i
should
beg
miss
gregory
to
tell
him
that
she
could
not
make
him
welcome
to
her
house
in
all
things
i
will
do
as
though
i
were
your
daughter
though
i
know
so
well
how
far
i
am
from
any
right
to
make
use
of
so
dear
a
name
but
dear
dear
aunt
no
daughter
could
love
you
better
nor
strive
more
faithfully
to
be
obedient
i
shall
always
be
even
when
you
are
most
angry
with
me
your
own
poor
loving
most
affectionate
the
other
letter
need
perhaps
be
not
given
in
its
entirety
even
in
such
a
chronicle
as
this
there
seems
to
be
something
of
treachery
something
of
a
want
of
that
forbearance
to
which
young
ladies
are
entitled
in
making
public
the
words
of
love
which
such
a
one
may
write
to
her
lover
bessy
s
letter
was
no
doubt
full
of
love
but
it
was
full
of
prudence
also
she
begged
him
not
to
come
to
avranches
as
to
such
a
marriage
as
that
of
which
he
had
spoken
it
was
she
assured
him
quite
impossible
she
would
never
give
him
up
and
so
she
had
told
mrs
miles
in
that
respect
her
duty
to
him
was
above
her
duty
to
her
aunt
but
she
was
so
subject
to
her
aunt
that
she
would
not
in
any
other
matter
disobey
her
for
his
sake
for
philip
s
sake
only
for
philip
s
sake
she
grieved
that
there
should
be
more
delay
of
course
she
was
aware
that
it
might
possibly
be
a
trouble
in
life
too
many
for
him
to
bear
in
that
case
he
might
make
himself
free
from
it
without
a
word
of
reproach
from
her
of
that
he
alone
must
be
the
judge
but
for
the
present
she
could
be
no
partner
to
any
plans
for
the
future
her
aunt
had
desired
her
to
stay
at
avranches
and
at
avranches
she
must
remain
there
were
words
of
love
no
doubt
but
the
letter
taken
altogether
was
much
sterner
and
less
demonstrative
of
affection
than
that
written
to
her
aunt
there
very
soon
came
a
rejoinder
from
mrs
miles
but
it
was
so
curt
and
harsh
as
almost
to
crush
bessy
by
its
laconic
severity
you
are
separated
from
me
and
i
am
your
that
was
all
beneath
that
one
line
the
old
woman
had
signed
her
name
miles
in
large
plain
angry
letters
bessy
who
knew
every
turn
of
the
woman
s
mind
understood
exactly
how
it
had
been
with
her
when
she
wrote
those
few
words
and
when
with
care
she
had
traced
that
indignant
signature
then
everything
shall
be
broken
and
though
there
was
but
one
gleam
of
sunshine
left
to
me
that
gleam
shall
be
extinguished
no
one
shall
say
that
i
as
lady
of
launay
did
not
do
my
it
was
thus
the
lady
of
launay
had
communed
with
herself
when
she
penned
that
dreadful
line
bessy
understood
it
all
and
could
almost
see
the
woman
as
she
wrote
it
then
in
her
desolation
she
told
everything
to
miss
gregory
showed
the
two
former
letters
showed
that
dreadful
denunciation
of
lasting
wrath
and
described
exactly
what
had
been
her
own
letter
both
to
mrs
miles
and
to
her
lover
miss
gregory
had
but
one
recipe
to
offer
in
such
a
malady
that
namely
which
she
had
taken
herself
in
a
somewhat
similar
sickness
the
gentleman
should
be
allowed
to
go
forth
into
the
world
and
seek
a
fitter
wife
whereas
bessy
should
content
herself
for
the
remainder
of
her
life
with
the
pleasures
of
memory
miss
gregory
thought
that
it
was
much
even
to
have
been
once
loved
by
the
when
bessy
almost
angrily
declared
that
this
would
not
be
enough
for
her
miss
gregory
very
meekly
suggested
that
possibly
affection
might
change
in
the
lapse
of
years
and
that
some
other
suitor
perhaps
morrison
might
in
course
of
time
suffice
but
at
the
idea
bessy
became
indignant
and
miss
gregory
was
glad
to
confine
herself
to
the
remedy
pure
and
simple
which
she
acknowledged
to
have
been
good
for
herself
then
there
passed
a
month
a
month
without
a
line
from
launay
or
from
philip
that
mrs
miles
should
not
write
again
was
to
be
expected
she
had
declared
her
enmity
and
there
was
an
end
of
everything
during
the
month
there
had
come
a
cheque
to
miss
gregory
from
some
man
of
business
and
with
the
cheque
there
had
been
no
intimation
that
the
present
arrangement
was
to
be
brought
to
a
close
it
appeared
therefore
that
mrs
miles
in
spite
of
her
enmity
intended
to
provide
for
the
mutinous
girl
a
continuation
of
the
comforts
which
she
now
enjoyed
certainly
nothing
more
than
this
could
have
been
expected
from
her
but
in
regard
to
philip
though
bessy
had
assured
herself
and
had
assured
miss
gregory
also
that
she
did
not
at
all
desire
a
correspondence
in
the
present
condition
of
affairs
still
she
felt
so
total
a
cessation
of
all
tidings
to
be
hard
to
bear
mary
gregory
when
writing
to
her
aunt
said
nothing
of
philip
merely
remarked
that
bessy
pryor
would
be
glad
to
know
that
her
aunt
had
nearly
recovered
her
health
and
was
again
able
to
go
out
among
the
poor
then
bessy
began
to
think
not
that
philip
was
like
the
for
to
that
idea
she
would
not
give
way
at
all
but
that
higher
and
nobler
motives
had
induced
him
to
yield
to
his
mother
if
so
she
would
never
reproach
him
if
so
she
would
forgive
him
in
her
heart
of
hearts
if
so
she
would
accept
her
destiny
and
entreat
her
old
friend
to
allow
her
to
return
once
more
to
launay
and
thenceforth
to
endure
the
evil
thing
which
fate
would
have
done
to
her
in
patient
submission
if
once
the
word
should
have
come
to
her
from
philip
then
would
she
freely
declare
that
everything
should
be
over
then
and
for
always
between
her
and
her
lover
after
such
suffering
as
that
while
she
was
undergoing
agony
so
severe
surely
her
friend
would
forgive
her
that
terrible
word
i
am
your
enemy
would
surely
then
be
withdrawn
but
if
it
were
to
be
so
if
this
was
to
be
the
end
of
her
love
philip
at
least
would
write
he
would
not
leave
her
in
doubt
after
such
a
decision
on
his
own
part
that
thought
ought
to
have
sustained
her
but
it
was
explained
to
her
by
miss
gregory
that
the
had
taken
three
months
before
he
had
been
inspirited
to
send
the
fatal
letter
and
to
declare
his
purpose
of
marrying
money
there
could
be
but
little
doubt
according
to
miss
gregory
that
philip
was
undergoing
the
same
process
it
was
she
thought
the
natural
end
to
such
an
affair
this
was
the
kind
of
thing
which
young
ladies
without
dowry
but
with
hearts
to
love
are
doomed
to
suffer
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
miss
gregory
regarded
the
termination
of
the
affair
with
a
certain
amount
of
sympathetic
satisfaction
could
she
have
given
bessy
all
launay
and
her
lover
she
would
have
done
so
but
sadness
and
disappointment
were
congenial
to
her
and
a
heart
broken
but
still
constant
was
to
her
thinking
a
pretty
feminine
acquisition
she
was
to
herself
the
heroine
of
her
own
romance
and
she
thought
it
good
to
be
a
heroine
but
bessy
was
indignant
not
that
philip
should
be
false
but
that
he
should
not
dare
to
write
and
say
so
i
think
he
ought
to
write
was
on
her
lips
when
the
door
was
opened
and
lo
all
of
a
sudden
philip
miles
was
in
the
room
chapter
x
how
bessy
pryor
s
lover
argued
his
case
we
must
now
go
back
to
launay
it
will
be
remembered
that
bessy
received
both
her
letters
on
the
same
day
those
namely
from
mrs
miles
and
from
philip
and
that
they
both
came
from
launay
philip
had
been
sent
away
from
the
place
when
the
fact
of
his
declared
love
was
first
made
known
to
the
old
lady
as
though
into
a
banishment
which
was
to
be
perpetual
till
he
should
have
repented
of
his
sin
such
certainly
had
been
his
mother
s
intention
he
was
to
be
sent
one
way
and
the
girl
another
and
everyone
concerned
was
to
be
made
to
feel
the
terrible
weight
of
her
displeasure
till
repentance
and
retractation
should
come
he
was
to
be
starved
into
obedience
by
a
minimised
allowance
and
she
by
the
weariness
of
her
life
at
avranches
but
the
person
most
grievously
punished
by
these
arrangements
was
herself
she
had
declared
to
herself
that
she
would
endure
anything
everything
in
the
performance
of
her
duty
but
the
desolation
of
her
life
was
so
extreme
that
it
was
very
hard
to
bear
she
did
not
shrink
and
tell
herself
that
it
was
unendurable
but
after
awhile
she
persuaded
herself
that
now
that
bessy
was
gone
there
could
be
no
reason
why
philip
also
should
be
exiled
would
not
her
influence
be
more
potent
over
philip
if
he
were
at
launay
she
therefore
sent
for
him
and
he
came
thus
it
was
that
the
two
letters
were
written
from
the
same
house
philip
obeyed
his
mother
s
behest
in
coming
as
he
had
obeyed
it
in
going
but
he
did
not
hesitate
to
show
her
that
he
felt
himself
to
be
aggrieved
launay
of
course
belonged
to
her
she
could
leave
it
and
all
the
property
to
some
hospital
if
she
chose
he
was
well
aware
of
that
but
he
had
been
brought
up
as
the
heir
and
he
could
not
believe
that
there
should
come
such
a
ruin
of
heaven
and
earth
as
would
be
produced
by
any
change
in
his
mother
s
intentions
as
to
the
launay
property
touching
his
marriage
he
felt
that
he
had
a
right
to
marry
whom
he
pleased
as
long
as
she
was
a
lady
and
that
any
dictation
from
his
mother
in
such
a
matter
was
a
tyranny
not
to
be
endured
he
had
talked
it
all
over
with
the
rector
before
he
went
of
course
it
was
possible
that
his
mother
should
commit
such
an
injustice
as
that
at
which
the
rector
hinted
there
are
said
philip
no
bounds
to
it
was
however
he
thought
all
but
impossible
and
whether
probable
or
improbable
no
fear
of
such
tyranny
should
drive
him
from
his
purpose
he
was
a
little
magniloquent
perhaps
in
what
he
said
but
he
was
very
resolved
it
was
therefore
with
some
feeling
of
an
injury
inflicted
upon
him
that
he
first
greeted
his
mother
on
his
return
to
the
house
for
a
day
or
two
not
a
word
passed
about
bessy
of
course
i
am
delighted
to
be
with
you
and
glad
enough
to
have
the
shooting
he
said
in
answer
to
some
word
of
hers
i
shouldn
t
have
gone
as
you
know
unless
you
had
driven
me
this
was
hard
on
the
old
woman
but
she
bore
it
and
for
some
days
was
simply
affectionate
and
gentle
to
her
son
more
gentle
than
was
her
wont
then
she
wrote
to
bessy
and
told
her
son
that
she
was
writing
it
is
so
impossible
she
said
that
i
can
not
conceive
that
bessy
should
not
obey
me
when
she
comes
to
regard
it
at
a
i
see
no
impossibility
but
bessy
can
of
course
do
as
she
pleases
replied
philip
almost
jauntily
then
he
determined
that
he
also
would
write
there
were
no
further
disputes
on
the
matter
till
bessy
s
answer
came
and
then
mrs
miles
was
very
angry
indeed
she
had
done
her
best
so
to
write
her
letter
that
bessy
should
be
conquered
both
by
the
weight
of
her
arguments
and
by
the
warmth
of
her
love
if
reason
would
not
prevail
surely
gratitude
would
compel
her
to
do
as
she
was
bidden
but
the
very
first
words
of
bessy
s
letter
contained
a
flat
refusal
i
can
not
do
as
you
bid
who
was
this
girl
that
had
been
picked
out
of
a
gutter
that
she
should
persist
in
the
right
of
becoming
the
mistress
of
launay
in
a
moment
the
old
woman
s
love
was
turned
into
a
feeling
of
condemnation
nearly
akin
to
hatred
then
she
sent
off
her
short
rejoinder
declaring
herself
to
be
bessy
s
enemy
on
the
following
morning
regret
had
come
and
perhaps
remorse
she
was
a
woman
of
strong
passion
subject
to
impulses
which
were
at
the
time
uncontrollable
but
she
was
one
who
was
always
compelled
by
her
conscience
to
quick
repentance
and
sometimes
to
an
agonising
feeling
of
wrong
done
by
herself
to
declare
that
bessy
was
her
enemy
bessy
who
for
so
many
years
had
prevented
all
her
wishes
who
had
never
been
weary
of
to
her
who
had
been
patient
in
all
things
who
had
been
her
gleam
of
sunshine
of
whom
she
had
sometimes
said
to
herself
in
her
closet
that
the
child
was
certainly
nearer
to
perfection
than
any
other
human
being
that
she
had
known
true
it
was
not
fit
that
the
girl
should
become
mistress
of
launay
a
misfortune
had
happened
which
must
be
cured
if
even
by
the
severance
of
persons
so
dear
to
each
other
as
she
and
her
bessy
but
she
knew
that
she
had
signed
in
declaring
one
so
good
and
one
so
dear
to
be
her
enemy
but
what
should
she
do
next
days
went
on
and
she
did
nothing
she
simply
suffered
there
was
no
pretext
on
which
she
could
frame
an
affectionate
letter
to
her
child
she
could
not
write
and
ask
to
be
forgiven
for
the
harshness
of
her
letter
she
could
not
simply
revoke
the
sentence
she
had
pronounced
without
any
reference
to
philip
and
his
love
in
great
misery
with
a
strong
feeling
of
because
she
had
allowed
herself
to
be
violent
in
her
wrath
she
went
on
repentant
but
still
obstinate
till
philip
himself
forced
the
subject
upon
her
mother
he
said
one
day
is
it
not
time
that
things
should
be
settled
what
things
philip
you
know
my
what
intention
as
to
making
bessy
my
that
can
never
but
it
will
be
it
has
to
be
if
as
regards
my
own
feelings
i
could
bring
myself
to
yield
to
you
how
could
i
do
so
with
honour
in
regard
to
her
but
for
myself
nothing
on
earth
would
induce
me
to
change
my
mind
it
is
a
matter
on
which
a
man
has
to
judge
for
himself
and
i
have
not
heard
a
word
from
you
or
from
anyone
to
make
me
think
that
i
have
judged
do
birth
and
rank
go
for
nothing
he
paused
a
moment
and
then
he
answered
her
very
seriously
standing
up
and
looking
down
upon
her
as
he
did
so
for
very
much
with
me
i
do
not
think
that
i
could
have
brought
myself
to
choose
a
wife
whatever
might
have
been
a
woman
s
charms
except
among
ladies
i
found
this
one
to
be
the
chosen
companion
and
dearest
friend
of
the
finest
lady
i
at
this
the
old
woman
old
as
she
was
first
blushed
and
then
finding
herself
to
be
sobbing
turned
her
face
away
from
him
i
came
across
a
girl
of
whose
antecedents
i
could
be
quite
sure
of
whose
bringing
up
i
knew
all
the
particulars
as
to
whom
i
could
be
certain
that
every
hour
of
her
life
had
been
passed
among
the
best
possible
associations
i
heard
testimony
as
to
her
worth
and
her
temper
which
i
could
not
but
believe
as
to
her
outward
belongings
i
had
eyes
of
my
own
to
judge
could
i
be
wrong
in
asking
such
a
one
to
be
my
wife
can
i
be
regarded
as
unhappy
in
having
succeeded
with
her
could
i
be
acquitted
of
dishonour
if
i
were
to
desert
her
shall
i
be
held
to
be
contemptible
if
i
am
true
to
her
at
every
word
he
spoke
he
grew
in
her
esteem
at
this
present
crisis
of
her
life
she
did
not
wish
to
think
specially
well
of
him
though
he
was
her
son
but
she
could
not
help
herself
he
became
bigger
before
her
than
he
had
ever
been
before
and
more
of
a
man
it
was
she
felt
almost
vain
for
a
woman
to
lay
her
commands
either
this
way
or
that
upon
a
man
who
could
speak
to
her
as
philip
had
spoken
but
not
the
less
was
the
power
in
her
hands
she
could
bid
him
go
and
marry
and
be
a
beggar
she
could
tell
him
that
all
launay
should
go
to
his
brother
and
she
could
instantly
make
a
will
to
that
effect
so
strong
was
the
desire
for
masterdom
upon
her
that
she
longed
to
do
it
in
the
very
teeth
of
her
honest
wish
to
do
what
was
right
there
was
another
wish
a
longing
to
do
what
she
knew
to
be
wrong
there
was
a
struggle
within
during
which
she
strove
to
strengthen
herself
for
evil
but
it
was
vain
she
knew
of
herself
that
were
she
to
swear
to
him
that
he
was
disinherited
were
she
to
make
a
will
before
nightfall
carrying
out
her
threat
the
pangs
of
conscience
would
be
so
heavy
during
the
night
that
she
would
certainly
change
it
all
on
the
next
morning
of
what
use
is
a
sword
in
your
hand
if
you
have
not
the
heart
to
use
it
why
seek
to
be
turbulent
with
a
pistol
if
your
bosom
be
of
such
a
nature
that
your
finger
can
not
be
forced
to
pull
the
trigger
power
was
in
her
possession
but
she
could
not
use
it
the
power
rather
was
in
her
hands
she
could
not
punish
her
boy
even
though
he
had
deserved
it
she
had
punished
her
girl
and
from
that
moment
she
had
been
crushed
by
torments
because
of
the
thing
that
she
had
done
others
besides
mrs
miles
have
felt
with
something
of
regret
that
they
have
lacked
the
hardness
necessary
for
cruelty
and
the
courage
necessary
for
its
doing
how
shall
it
be
mother
asked
philip
as
she
knew
not
what
to
answer
she
rose
slowly
from
her
chair
and
leaving
the
room
went
to
the
seclusion
of
her
own
chamber
days
again
passed
before
philip
renewed
his
question
and
repeated
it
in
the
same
words
how
shall
it
be
mother
wistfully
she
looked
up
at
him
as
though
even
yet
something
might
be
accorded
by
him
to
pity
as
though
the
son
might
even
yet
be
induced
to
accede
to
his
mother
s
prayers
it
was
not
that
she
thought
so
no
she
had
thought
much
and
was
aware
that
it
could
not
be
so
but
as
a
dog
will
ask
with
its
eyes
when
it
knows
that
asking
is
in
vain
so
did
she
ask
one
word
from
you
mother
will
make
us
all
no
not
all
of
will
not
my
happiness
make
you
happy
then
he
stooped
over
her
and
kissed
her
forehead
could
you
be
happy
if
you
knew
that
i
were
wretched
i
do
not
want
to
be
happy
it
should
be
enough
that
one
does
one
s
and
what
is
my
duty
can
it
be
my
duty
to
betray
the
girl
i
love
in
order
that
i
may
increase
an
estate
which
is
already
large
enough
it
is
for
the
what
is
a
family
but
you
or
i
or
whoever
for
the
moment
may
be
its
representative
say
that
it
shall
be
as
i
would
have
it
and
then
i
will
go
to
her
and
let
her
know
that
she
may
come
back
to
your
not
then
or
on
the
next
day
or
on
the
next
did
she
yield
though
she
knew
well
during
all
these
hours
that
it
was
her
fate
to
yield
she
had
indeed
yielded
she
had
confessed
to
herself
that
it
must
be
so
and
as
she
did
so
she
felt
once
more
the
soft
pressure
of
bessy
s
arms
as
they
would
cling
round
her
neck
and
she
could
see
once
more
the
brightness
of
bessy
s
eyes
as
the
girl
would
hang
over
her
bed
early
in
the
morning
i
do
not
want
to
be
happy
she
had
said
but
she
did
want
sorely
want
to
see
her
girl
you
may
go
and
tell
her
she
said
one
night
as
she
was
preparing
to
go
to
her
chamber
then
she
turned
quickly
away
and
was
out
of
the
room
before
he
could
answer
her
with
a
word
chapter
xi
how
bessy
pryor
received
her
lover
miss
gregory
was
certainly
surprised
when
on
the
entrance
of
the
young
man
bessy
jumped
from
her
chair
and
rushed
into
his
arms
she
knew
that
bessy
had
no
brother
and
her
instinct
rather
than
her
experience
told
her
that
the
greeting
which
she
saw
was
more
than
fraternal
more
than
cousinly
she
did
not
doubt
but
that
the
young
man
was
philip
launay
and
knowing
what
she
knew
she
was
not
disposed
to
make
spoken
complaints
but
when
bessy
lifted
her
face
to
be
kissed
miss
gregory
became
red
and
very
uneasy
it
is
probable
that
she
herself
had
never
progressed
as
far
as
this
with
the
young
man
who
afterwards
became
the
bessy
herself
had
a
minute
been
allowed
to
her
for
reflection
would
have
been
less
affectionate
she
knew
nothing
of
the
cause
which
had
brought
philip
to
avranches
she
only
knew
that
her
dear
friend
at
launay
had
declared
her
to
be
an
enemy
and
that
she
had
determined
that
she
could
not
for
years
become
the
wife
of
philip
launay
without
the
consent
of
her
who
had
used
that
cruel
word
and
at
the
moment
of
philip
s
entering
the
room
her
heart
had
been
sore
with
reproaches
against
him
he
ought
at
any
rate
to
the
words
had
been
on
her
lips
as
the
door
had
been
opened
and
the
words
had
been
spoken
in
the
soreness
of
heart
coming
from
a
fear
that
she
was
to
be
abandoned
then
he
was
there
in
the
moment
that
sufficed
for
the
glance
of
his
eye
to
meet
hers
she
knew
that
she
was
not
abandoned
with
whatever
tidings
he
had
come
that
was
not
to
be
the
burden
of
his
news
no
man
desirous
of
being
released
from
his
vows
ever
looked
like
that
so
up
she
jumped
and
flew
to
him
not
quite
knowing
what
she
intended
but
filled
with
delight
when
she
found
herself
pressed
to
his
bosom
then
she
had
to
remember
herself
and
to
escape
from
his
arms
philip
she
said
this
is
miss
gregory
miss
gregory
i
do
not
think
you
ever
met
then
miss
gregory
had
to
endeavour
to
look
as
though
nothing
particular
had
taken
place
which
was
a
trial
but
bessy
bore
her
part
if
not
without
a
struggle
at
least
without
showing
it
and
now
philip
she
said
how
is
my
aunt
a
great
deal
stronger
than
when
you
left
quite
well
yes
for
her
i
think
i
may
say
quite
she
goes
out
every
day
every
day
after
the
old
plan
the
carriage
toddles
round
to
the
door
at
three
and
then
toddles
about
the
parish
at
the
rate
of
four
miles
an
hour
and
toddles
home
exactly
at
five
the
people
at
launay
miss
gregory
don
t
want
clocks
to
tell
them
the
hour
in
the
i
do
love
punctuality
said
miss
gregory
i
wish
i
were
with
her
said
bessy
i
have
come
to
take
you
said
philip
have
you
then
bessy
blushed
for
the
first
time
she
blushed
as
a
hundred
various
thoughts
rushed
across
her
mind
if
he
had
been
sent
to
take
her
back
sent
by
her
aunt
instead
of
knowl
what
a
revulsion
of
circumstances
must
there
not
have
been
at
launay
how
could
it
all
have
come
to
pass
even
to
have
been
sent
for
at
all
to
be
allowed
to
go
back
even
in
disgrace
would
have
been
an
inexpressible
joy
had
knowl
come
for
her
with
a
grim
look
and
an
assurance
that
she
was
to
be
brought
back
because
a
prison
at
launay
was
thought
to
be
more
secure
than
a
prison
at
avranches
the
prospect
of
a
return
would
have
been
hailed
with
joy
but
now
to
be
taken
back
by
philip
to
launay
there
was
a
whole
heaven
of
delight
in
the
thought
of
the
very
journey
miss
gregory
endeavoured
to
look
pleased
but
in
truth
the
prospect
to
her
was
not
so
pleasant
as
to
bessy
she
was
to
be
left
alone
again
she
was
to
lose
her
pensioner
after
so
short
a
fruition
of
the
double
bliss
of
society
and
pay
she
was
to
be
deserted
without
a
thought
but
to
be
deserted
without
many
thoughts
had
been
her
lot
in
life
and
now
she
bore
her
misfortune
like
a
heroine
you
will
be
glad
to
go
back
to
your
aunt
bessy
will
you
not
glad
the
ecstacy
was
almost
unkind
but
poor
miss
gregory
bore
it
and
maintained
that
pretty
smile
of
gratified
serenity
as
though
everything
were
well
with
all
of
them
but
bessy
felt
that
she
had
as
yet
heard
nothing
of
the
real
news
and
that
the
real
news
could
not
be
told
in
the
presence
of
miss
gregory
it
had
not
even
yet
occurred
to
her
that
mrs
miles
had
actually
given
her
sanction
to
the
marriage
this
is
a
very
pretty
place
said
philip
what
avranches
said
miss
gregory
mindful
of
future
possible
pensioners
oh
delightful
it
is
the
prettiest
place
in
normandy
and
i
think
the
most
healthy
town
in
all
it
seemed
nice
as
i
came
up
from
the
hotel
suppose
we
go
out
for
a
walk
bessy
we
have
to
start
back
ejaculated
bessy
she
would
have
been
ready
to
go
in
half
an
hour
had
he
demanded
it
if
you
can
manage
it
i
promised
my
mother
to
be
as
quick
as
i
could
and
when
i
arranged
to
come
i
had
ever
so
many
if
she
must
go
she
won
t
have
much
time
for
walking
said
miss
gregory
with
almost
a
touch
of
anger
in
her
voice
but
bessy
was
determined
to
have
her
walk
all
her
fate
in
life
was
to
be
disclosed
to
her
within
the
next
few
minutes
she
was
already
exultant
but
she
was
beginning
to
think
that
there
was
a
heaven
indeed
opening
for
her
so
she
ran
away
for
her
hat
and
gloves
leaving
her
lover
and
miss
gregory
together
it
is
very
sudden
said
the
poor
old
lady
with
a
gasp
my
mother
felt
that
and
bade
me
tell
you
that
of
course
the
full
twelvemonth
i
was
not
thinking
about
that
said
miss
gregory
i
did
not
mean
to
allude
to
such
a
thing
mrs
miles
has
always
been
so
kind
to
my
brother
and
anything
i
could
have
done
i
should
have
been
so
happy
without
thinking
of
money
but
philip
sat
with
the
air
of
an
attentive
listener
so
that
miss
gregory
could
get
no
answer
to
her
question
without
absolutely
asking
it
but
there
seems
to
be
a
yes
there
is
a
change
miss
we
were
afraid
that
mrs
miles
had
been
it
is
the
old
story
miss
gregory
young
people
and
old
people
very
often
will
not
think
alike
but
it
is
the
young
people
who
generally
have
their
she
had
not
had
her
way
she
remembered
that
at
the
moment
but
then
perhaps
the
had
had
his
when
a
period
of
life
has
come
too
late
for
success
when
all
has
been
failure
the
expanding
triumphs
of
the
glorious
young
grate
upon
the
feelings
even
of
those
who
are
generous
and
miss
gregory
was
generous
by
nature
and
by
practice
but
philip
s
pÃ¦an
and
bessy
s
wondrous
prosperity
were
for
a
moment
a
little
hard
upon
her
there
had
been
a
comfort
to
her
in
the
conviction
that
philip
was
no
better
than
the
i
suppose
it
is
so
she
said
that
is
if
one
of
them
has
but
if
they
are
both
poor
i
don
t
see
how
their
being
young
can
enable
them
to
live
upon
she
intended
to
imply
that
philip
probably
would
have
been
another
but
that
he
was
heir
to
launay
philip
who
had
never
heard
of
the
was
a
little
puzzled
nevertheless
he
acceded
to
the
proposition
not
caring
however
to
say
anything
as
to
his
own
circumstances
on
so
very
short
an
acquaintance
then
bessy
came
down
with
her
hat
and
they
started
for
their
walk
now
tell
me
all
about
it
she
said
in
a
fever
of
expectation
as
soon
as
the
front
door
was
closed
behind
them
there
is
nothing
more
to
tell
said
he
nothing
more
unless
you
want
me
to
say
that
i
love
of
course
i
well
then
i
love
you
there
philip
you
are
not
half
nice
to
not
after
coming
all
the
way
from
launay
to
say
that
there
must
be
so
much
to
tell
me
why
has
my
aunt
sent
for
me
because
she
wants
and
why
has
she
sent
you
because
i
want
you
but
does
she
want
me
certainly
she
for
you
if
he
could
say
this
then
everything
would
have
been
said
if
he
could
say
this
truly
then
everything
would
have
been
done
necessary
for
the
perfection
of
her
happiness
oh
philip
do
tell
me
it
is
so
strange
that
she
should
send
for
me
do
you
know
what
she
said
to
me
in
her
last
letter
it
was
not
a
letter
it
was
only
a
word
she
said
that
i
was
her
all
that
is
she
will
be
glad
to
have
me
again
very
glad
i
fancy
that
she
has
been
miserable
without
i
shall
be
as
glad
to
be
with
her
again
philip
you
do
not
know
how
i
love
her
think
of
all
she
has
done
for
me
she
has
done
something
now
that
i
hope
will
beat
everything
what
has
she
done
she
has
consented
that
you
and
i
shall
be
man
and
wife
isn
t
that
more
than
all
the
rest
but
has
she
oh
philip
has
she
really
done
that
then
at
last
he
told
his
whole
story
yes
his
mother
had
yielded
from
the
moment
in
which
she
had
walked
out
of
the
room
having
said
that
he
might
go
and
tell
her
she
had
never
endeavoured
to
renew
the
fight
when
he
had
spoken
to
her
endeavouring
to
draw
from
her
some
warmth
of
assent
she
had
generally
been
very
silent
she
had
never
brought
herself
absolutely
to
wish
him
joy
she
had
not
as
yet
so
crucified
her
own
spirit
in
the
matter
as
to
be
able
to
tell
him
that
he
had
chosen
his
wife
well
but
she
had
shown
him
in
a
hundred
ways
that
her
anger
was
at
an
end
and
that
if
any
feeling
was
left
opposed
to
his
own
happiness
it
was
simply
one
of
sorrow
and
there
were
signs
which
made
him
think
that
even
that
was
not
she
would
pat
him
stroking
his
hair
and
leaning
on
his
shoulder
administering
to
his
comforts
with
a
nervous
accuracy
as
to
little
things
which
was
peculiar
to
her
and
then
she
gave
him
an
infinity
of
directions
as
to
the
way
in
which
it
would
be
proper
that
bessy
should
travel
being
anxious
at
first
to
send
over
a
maid
for
her
behoof
not
knowl
but
a
younger
woman
who
would
have
been
at
bessy
s
command
philip
however
objected
to
the
maid
and
when
mrs
miles
remarked
that
if
it
was
bessy
s
fate
to
become
mistress
of
launay
bessy
ought
to
have
a
maid
to
attend
her
philip
said
that
that
would
be
very
well
a
month
or
two
hence
when
bessy
would
have
become
not
mistress
of
launay
which
was
a
place
which
he
trusted
might
not
be
vacant
for
many
a
long
day
but
first
lieutenant
to
the
mistress
by
right
of
marriage
he
refused
altogether
to
take
the
maid
with
him
as
he
explained
to
bessy
with
much
laughter
and
so
they
came
to
understand
each
other
thoroughly
and
bessy
knew
that
the
great
trouble
of
her
life
which
had
been
as
a
mountain
in
her
way
had
disappeared
suddenly
as
might
some
visionary
mountain
and
then
when
they
thoroughly
understood
each
other
they
started
back
to
england
and
to
launay
together
chapter
xii
how
bessy
pryor
was
brought
back
and
what
then
became
of
her
bessy
understood
the
condition
of
the
old
woman
much
better
than
did
her
son
i
am
sad
a
little
she
said
on
her
way
home
because
of
her
sad
because
she
is
to
have
you
you
yourself
for
her
yes
indeed
philip
because
i
know
that
she
has
not
wanted
me
she
will
be
kind
because
i
shall
belong
to
you
and
perhaps
partly
because
she
loves
me
but
she
will
always
regret
that
that
young
lady
down
in
cornwall
has
not
been
allowed
to
add
to
the
honour
and
greatness
of
the
family
the
launays
are
everything
to
her
and
what
can
i
do
for
the
launays
of
course
he
said
many
pretty
things
to
her
in
answer
to
this
but
he
could
not
eradicate
from
her
mind
the
feeling
that
in
regard
to
the
old
friend
who
had
been
so
kind
to
her
she
was
returning
evil
for
good
but
even
bessy
did
not
quite
understand
the
old
woman
when
she
found
that
she
had
yielded
there
was
disappointment
in
the
old
woman
s
heart
who
can
have
indulged
in
a
certain
longing
for
a
lifetime
in
a
special
ambition
and
seen
that
ambition
and
that
longing
crushed
and
trampled
on
without
such
a
feeling
and
she
had
brought
this
failure
on
herself
by
her
own
weakness
as
she
told
herself
why
had
she
given
way
to
bessy
and
to
bessy
s
blandishments
it
was
because
she
had
not
been
strong
to
do
her
duty
that
this
ruin
had
fallen
upon
her
hopes
the
power
in
her
own
hands
had
been
sufficient
but
for
her
philip
need
never
have
seen
bessy
pryor
might
not
bessy
pryor
have
been
sent
somewhere
out
of
the
way
when
it
became
evident
that
she
had
charms
of
her
own
with
which
to
be
dangerous
and
even
after
the
first
evil
had
been
done
her
power
had
been
sufficient
she
need
not
have
sent
for
philip
back
she
need
have
written
no
letter
to
bessy
she
might
have
been
calm
and
steady
in
her
purpose
so
that
there
should
have
been
no
violent
ebullition
of
anger
so
violent
as
to
induce
repentance
and
with
repentance
renewed
softness
and
all
the
pangs
of
renewed
repentance
when
philip
had
left
her
on
his
mission
to
normandy
her
heart
was
heavy
with
regret
and
heavy
also
with
anger
but
it
was
with
herself
that
she
was
angry
she
had
known
her
duty
and
she
had
not
done
it
she
had
known
her
duty
and
had
neglected
it
because
bessy
had
been
soft
to
her
and
dear
and
pleasant
it
was
here
that
bessy
did
not
quite
understand
her
friend
bessy
reproached
herself
because
she
had
made
to
her
friend
a
bad
return
to
all
the
kindness
she
had
received
the
old
woman
would
not
allow
herself
to
entertain
any
such
a
thought
once
she
had
spoken
to
herself
of
having
warmed
a
serpent
in
her
bosom
but
instantly
with
infinite
she
had
declared
to
herself
that
bessy
was
no
serpent
for
all
that
she
had
done
for
bessy
bessy
had
made
ample
return
the
only
possible
return
that
could
be
full
enough
bessy
had
loved
her
she
too
had
loved
bessy
but
that
should
have
had
no
weight
though
they
two
had
been
linked
together
by
their
very
heartstrings
it
had
been
her
duty
to
make
a
severance
because
their
joint
affection
had
been
dangerous
she
had
allowed
her
own
heart
to
her
own
sense
of
duty
and
therefore
she
was
angry
not
with
bessy
but
with
herself
but
the
thing
was
done
to
quarrel
with
philip
had
been
impossible
to
her
one
feeling
coming
upon
another
her
own
repentance
her
own
weakness
her
acknowledgment
of
a
certain
man
s
strength
on
the
part
of
her
son
had
brought
her
to
such
a
condition
that
she
had
yielded
then
it
was
natural
that
she
should
endeavour
to
make
the
best
of
it
but
even
the
doing
of
that
was
a
trial
to
her
when
she
told
herself
that
as
far
as
the
woman
went
the
mere
woman
philip
could
not
have
found
a
better
wife
had
he
searched
the
world
all
round
she
found
that
she
was
being
tempted
from
her
proper
path
even
in
that
what
right
could
she
have
to
look
for
consolation
there
for
other
reasons
which
she
still
felt
to
be
adequate
she
had
resolved
that
something
else
should
be
done
that
something
else
had
not
been
done
because
she
had
failed
in
her
duty
and
now
she
was
trying
to
salve
the
sore
by
the
very
poison
which
had
created
the
wound
bessy
s
sweet
temper
and
bessy
s
soft
voice
and
bessy
s
bright
eye
and
bessy
s
devotion
to
the
delight
of
others
were
all
so
many
temptations
grovelling
as
she
was
in
sackcloth
and
ashes
because
she
had
yielded
to
them
how
could
she
console
herself
by
a
prospect
of
these
future
enjoyments
either
for
herself
or
her
son
but
there
were
various
duties
to
which
she
could
attend
grievously
afflicted
as
she
was
by
her
want
of
attention
to
that
great
duty
as
fate
had
determined
that
bessy
pryor
was
to
become
mistress
of
launay
it
was
proper
that
all
launay
should
know
and
recognise
its
future
mistress
bessy
certainly
should
not
be
punished
by
any
want
of
earnestness
in
this
respect
no
one
should
be
punished
but
herself
the
new
mistress
should
be
made
as
welcome
as
though
she
had
been
the
girl
from
cornwall
knowl
was
a
good
deal
put
about
because
mrs
miles
remembering
a
few
hard
words
which
knowl
had
allowed
herself
to
use
in
the
days
of
the
imprisonment
became
very
stern
it
is
settled
that
miss
pryor
is
to
become
philip
launay
and
you
will
obey
her
just
as
knowl
who
had
saved
a
little
money
began
to
consider
whether
it
would
not
be
as
well
to
retire
into
private
life
when
the
day
came
on
which
the
two
travellers
were
to
reach
launay
mrs
miles
was
very
much
disturbed
in
her
mind
in
what
way
should
she
receive
the
girl
in
her
last
communication
her
very
last
she
had
called
bessy
her
enemy
and
now
bessy
was
being
brought
home
to
be
made
her
under
her
own
roof
how
sweet
it
would
be
to
stand
at
the
door
and
welcome
her
in
the
hall
among
all
the
smiling
servants
to
make
a
tender
fuss
and
hovering
over
her
as
would
be
so
natural
with
a
who
loved
an
adopted
daughter
as
tenderly
as
mrs
miles
loved
bessy
how
pleasant
to
take
her
by
the
hand
and
lead
her
away
into
some
inner
sanctum
where
warm
kisses
as
between
mother
and
child
would
be
given
and
taken
to
hear
her
praises
of
philip
and
then
to
answer
again
with
other
praises
to
tell
her
with
words
half
serious
and
half
drollery
that
she
must
now
buckle
on
her
armour
and
do
her
work
and
take
upon
herself
the
task
of
managing
the
household
there
was
quite
enough
of
softness
in
the
old
woman
to
make
all
this
delightful
her
imagination
revelled
in
thinking
of
it
even
at
the
moment
in
which
she
was
telling
herself
that
it
was
impossible
but
it
was
impossible
were
she
to
force
such
a
change
upon
herself
bessy
would
not
believe
in
the
sincerity
of
the
change
she
had
told
bessy
that
she
was
her
enemy
at
last
the
carriage
which
had
gone
to
the
station
was
here
not
the
waggonette
on
this
occasion
but
the
real
carriage
itself
the
carriage
which
was
wont
to
toddle
four
miles
an
hour
about
the
parish
this
is
an
honour
meant
for
the
prodigal
daughter
said
philip
as
he
took
his
seat
if
you
had
never
been
naughty
we
should
only
have
had
the
waggonette
and
we
then
should
have
been
there
in
half
the
mrs
miles
when
she
heard
the
wheels
on
the
gravel
was
even
yet
uncertain
where
she
would
place
herself
she
was
fluttered
moving
about
from
the
room
into
the
hall
and
back
when
the
old
butler
spoke
a
careful
word
go
into
the
library
madam
and
philip
will
bring
her
to
you
then
she
obeyed
the
butler
as
she
had
probably
never
done
in
her
life
before
bessy
as
soon
as
her
step
was
off
the
carriage
ran
very
quickly
into
the
house
where
is
my
aunt
she
said
the
butler
was
there
showing
the
way
and
in
a
moment
she
had
thrown
her
arms
round
the
old
woman
bessy
had
a
way
of
making
her
kisses
obligatory
from
which
mrs
miles
had
never
been
able
to
escape
then
when
the
old
woman
was
seated
bessy
was
at
once
upon
her
knees
before
her
say
that
you
love
me
aunt
say
that
at
once
say
that
first
of
all
you
know
i
love
i
know
i
love
you
oh
i
am
so
glad
to
have
you
again
it
was
so
hard
not
to
be
with
you
when
i
thought
that
you
were
ill
i
did
not
know
how
sick
it
would
make
me
to
be
away
from
neither
then
nor
at
any
time
afterwards
was
there
a
word
spoken
on
the
one
side
or
the
other
as
to
that
declaration
of
enmity
there
was
nothing
then
said
in
way
of
explanation
there
was
nothing
perhaps
necessary
it
was
clear
to
bessy
that
she
was
received
at
launay
as
philip
s
future
wife
not
only
by
mrs
miles
herself
but
by
the
whole
household
and
that
all
the
honours
of
the
place
were
to
be
awarded
to
her
without
stint
for
herself
that
would
have
sufficed
to
her
any
explanation
of
the
circumstances
which
had
led
to
a
change
so
violent
was
quite
unnecessary
but
it
was
not
so
with
mrs
miles
herself
she
could
not
but
say
some
word
in
justification
of
herself
in
excuse
rather
than
justification
she
had
bessy
into
her
bedroom
that
night
and
said
the
word
holding
between
her
two
thin
hands
the
hand
of
the
girl
she
addressed
you
have
known
bessy
that
i
did
not
wish
bessy
muttered
that
she
did
know
it
and
i
think
you
knew
how
could
i
help
it
aunt
upon
this
the
old
woman
patted
the
hand
i
suppose
he
could
not
help
it
and
if
i
had
been
a
young
man
i
could
not
have
helped
it
i
could
not
help
it
as
i
was
though
i
am
an
old
woman
i
think
i
am
as
foolish
as
he
perhaps
he
is
foolish
but
you
are
well
i
do
not
know
i
have
my
misgivings
about
that
my
dear
i
had
objects
which
i
thought
were
sacred
and
holy
to
which
i
had
been
wedded
through
many
years
they
have
had
to
be
thrust
then
you
will
hate
me
no
my
child
i
will
love
you
with
all
my
heart
you
will
be
my
son
s
wife
now
and
as
such
you
will
be
dear
to
me
almost
as
he
is
dear
and
you
will
still
be
my
own
bessy
my
gleam
of
sunlight
without
whom
the
house
is
so
gloomy
that
it
is
like
a
prison
to
me
for
myself
do
you
think
i
could
want
any
other
young
woman
about
the
house
than
my
own
dear
bessy
that
any
other
wife
for
philip
could
come
as
near
my
heart
as
you
do
but
if
i
have
stood
in
the
way
we
will
not
think
of
it
any
more
you
at
any
rate
need
not
think
of
it
added
the
old
woman
as
she
remembered
all
the
circumstances
you
shall
be
made
welcome
with
all
the
honours
and
all
the
privileges
due
to
philip
s
wife
and
if
there
be
a
regret
it
shall
never
trouble
your
path
it
may
be
a
comfort
to
you
to
hear
me
say
that
you
at
least
in
all
things
have
done
your
then
at
last
there
were
more
tears
more
embracings
and
before
either
of
them
went
to
their
rest
a
perfect
ecstacy
of
love
little
or
nothing
more
is
necessary
for
the
telling
of
the
story
of
the
lady
of
launay
before
the
autumn
had
quite
gone
and
the
last
tint
had
left
the
trees
bessy
pryor
became
bessy
launay
under
the
hand
of
gregory
in
the
launay
parish
church
everyone
in
the
neighbourhood
around
was
there
except
morrison
who
had
taken
this
opportunity
of
having
a
holiday
and
visiting
switzerland
but
even
he
when
he
returned
soon
became
reconciled
to
the
arrangement
and
again
became
a
guest
in
the
of
the
mansion
i
hope
i
shall
have
no
reader
who
will
not
think
that
philip
launay
did
well
in
not
following
the
example
of
the
christmas
at
thompson
hall
chapter
brown
s
success
everyone
remembers
the
severity
of
the
christmas
of
i
will
not
designate
the
year
more
closely
lest
i
should
enable
those
who
are
too
curious
to
investigate
the
circumstances
of
this
story
and
inquire
into
details
which
i
do
not
intend
to
make
known
that
winter
however
was
especially
severe
and
the
cold
of
the
last
ten
days
of
december
was
more
felt
i
think
in
paris
than
in
any
part
of
england
it
may
indeed
be
doubted
whether
there
is
any
town
in
any
country
in
which
thoroughly
bad
weather
is
more
afflicting
than
in
the
french
capital
snow
and
hail
seem
to
be
colder
there
and
fires
certainly
are
less
warm
than
in
london
and
then
there
is
a
feeling
among
visitors
to
paris
that
paris
ought
to
be
gay
that
gaiety
prettiness
and
liveliness
are
its
aims
as
money
commerce
and
general
business
are
the
aims
of
london
which
with
its
outside
sombre
darkness
does
often
seem
to
want
an
excuse
for
its
ugliness
but
on
this
occasion
at
this
christmas
of
paris
was
neither
gay
nor
pretty
nor
lively
you
could
not
walk
the
streets
without
being
ankle
deep
not
in
snow
but
in
snow
that
had
just
become
slush
and
there
was
falling
throughout
the
day
and
night
of
the
of
december
a
succession
of
damp
abominations
from
the
sky
which
made
it
almost
impossible
for
men
and
women
to
go
about
their
business
it
was
at
ten
o
clock
on
that
evening
that
an
english
lady
and
gentleman
arrived
at
the
grand
hotel
on
the
boulevard
des
italiens
as
i
have
reasons
for
concealing
the
names
of
this
married
couple
i
will
call
them
and
brown
now
i
wish
it
to
be
understood
that
in
all
the
general
affairs
of
life
this
gentleman
and
this
lady
lived
happily
together
with
all
the
amenities
which
should
bind
a
husband
and
a
wife
brown
was
one
of
a
wealthy
family
and
brown
when
he
married
her
had
been
relieved
from
the
necessity
of
earning
his
bread
nevertheless
she
had
at
once
yielded
to
him
when
he
expressed
a
desire
to
spend
the
winters
of
their
life
in
the
south
of
france
and
he
though
he
was
by
disposition
somewhat
idle
and
but
little
prone
to
the
energetic
occupations
of
life
would
generally
allow
himself
at
other
periods
of
the
year
to
be
carried
hither
and
thither
by
her
whose
more
robust
nature
delighted
in
the
excitement
of
travelling
but
on
this
occasion
there
had
been
a
little
difference
between
them
early
in
december
an
intimation
had
reached
brown
at
pau
that
on
the
coming
christmas
there
was
to
be
a
great
gathering
of
all
the
thompsons
in
the
thompson
family
hall
at
and
that
she
who
had
been
a
thompson
was
desired
to
join
the
party
with
her
husband
on
this
occasion
her
only
sister
was
desirous
of
introducing
to
the
family
generally
a
most
excellent
young
man
to
whom
she
had
recently
become
engaged
the
thompsons
the
real
name
however
is
in
fact
concealed
were
a
numerous
and
a
thriving
people
there
were
uncles
and
cousins
and
brothers
who
had
all
done
well
in
the
world
and
who
were
all
likely
to
do
better
still
one
had
lately
been
returned
to
parliament
for
the
essex
flats
and
was
at
the
time
of
which
i
am
writing
a
conspicuous
member
of
the
gallant
conservative
majority
it
was
partly
in
triumph
at
this
success
that
the
great
christmas
gathering
of
the
thompsons
was
to
be
held
and
an
opinion
had
been
expressed
by
the
legislator
himself
that
should
brown
with
her
husband
fail
to
join
the
family
on
this
happy
occasion
she
and
he
would
be
regarded
as
being
but
thompsons
since
her
marriage
which
was
an
affair
now
nearly
eight
years
old
brown
had
never
passed
a
christmas
in
england
the
desirability
of
doing
so
had
often
been
mooted
by
her
her
very
soul
craved
the
festivities
of
holly
and
there
had
ever
been
meetings
of
the
thompsons
at
thompson
hall
though
meetings
not
so
significant
not
so
important
to
the
family
as
this
one
which
was
now
to
be
collected
more
than
once
had
she
expressed
a
wish
to
see
old
christmas
again
in
the
old
house
among
the
old
faces
but
her
husband
had
always
pleaded
a
certain
weakness
about
his
throat
and
chest
as
a
reason
for
remaining
among
the
delights
of
pau
year
after
year
she
had
yielded
and
now
this
loud
summons
had
come
it
was
not
without
considerable
trouble
that
she
had
induced
brown
to
come
as
far
as
paris
most
unwillingly
had
he
left
pau
and
then
twice
on
his
journey
both
at
bordeaux
and
tours
he
had
made
an
attempt
to
return
from
the
first
moment
he
had
pleaded
his
throat
and
when
at
last
he
had
consented
to
make
the
journey
he
had
stipulated
for
sleeping
at
those
two
towns
and
at
paris
brown
who
without
the
slightest
feeling
of
fatigue
could
have
made
the
journey
from
pau
to
stratford
without
stopping
had
assented
to
everything
so
that
they
might
be
at
thompson
hall
on
christmas
eve
when
brown
uttered
his
unavailing
complaints
at
the
two
first
towns
at
which
they
stayed
she
did
not
perhaps
quite
believe
all
that
he
said
of
his
own
condition
we
know
how
prone
the
strong
are
to
suspect
the
weakness
of
the
weak
as
the
weak
are
to
be
disgusted
by
the
strength
of
the
strong
there
were
perhaps
a
few
words
between
them
on
the
journey
but
the
result
had
hitherto
been
in
favour
of
the
lady
she
had
succeeded
in
bringing
brown
as
far
as
paris
had
the
occasion
been
less
important
no
doubt
she
would
have
yielded
the
weather
had
been
bad
even
when
they
left
pau
but
as
they
had
made
their
way
northwards
it
had
become
worse
and
still
worse
as
they
left
tours
brown
in
a
hoarse
whisper
had
declared
his
conviction
that
the
journey
would
kill
him
brown
however
had
unfortunately
noticed
half
an
hour
before
that
he
had
scolded
the
waiter
on
the
score
of
an
overcharged
franc
or
two
with
a
loud
and
clear
voice
had
she
really
believed
that
there
was
danger
or
even
suffering
she
would
have
yielded
but
no
woman
is
satisfied
in
such
a
matter
to
be
taken
in
by
false
pretences
she
observed
that
he
ate
a
good
dinner
on
his
way
to
paris
and
that
he
took
a
small
glass
of
cognac
with
complete
relish
which
a
man
really
suffering
from
bronchitis
surely
would
not
do
so
she
persevered
and
brought
him
into
paris
late
in
the
evening
in
the
midst
of
all
that
slush
and
snow
then
as
they
sat
down
to
supper
she
thought
that
he
did
speak
hoarsely
and
her
loving
feminine
heart
began
to
misgive
her
but
this
now
was
at
any
rate
clear
to
her
that
he
could
not
be
worse
off
by
going
on
to
london
than
he
would
be
should
he
remain
in
paris
if
a
man
is
to
be
ill
he
had
better
be
ill
in
the
bosom
of
his
family
than
at
an
hotel
what
comfort
could
he
have
what
relief
in
that
huge
barrack
as
for
the
cruelty
of
the
weather
london
could
not
be
worse
than
paris
and
then
she
thought
she
had
heard
that
sea
air
is
good
for
a
sore
throat
in
that
bedroom
which
had
been
allotted
to
them
au
quatriÃ¨me
they
could
not
even
get
a
decent
fire
it
would
in
every
way
be
wrong
now
to
forego
the
great
christmas
gathering
when
nothing
could
be
gained
by
staying
in
paris
she
had
perceived
that
as
her
husband
became
really
ill
he
became
also
more
tractable
and
less
disputatious
immediately
after
that
little
glass
of
cognac
he
had
declared
that
he
would
be
if
he
would
go
beyond
paris
and
she
began
to
fear
that
after
all
everything
would
have
been
done
in
vain
but
as
they
went
down
to
supper
between
ten
and
eleven
he
was
more
subdued
and
merely
remarked
that
this
journey
would
he
was
sure
be
the
death
of
him
it
was
eleven
when
they
got
back
to
their
bedroom
and
then
he
seemed
to
speak
with
good
sense
and
also
with
much
real
apprehension
if
i
can
t
get
something
to
relieve
me
i
know
i
shall
never
make
my
way
on
he
said
it
was
intended
that
they
should
leave
the
hotel
at
five
the
next
morning
so
as
to
arrive
at
stratford
travelling
by
the
tidal
train
at
seven
on
christmas
eve
the
early
hour
the
long
journey
the
infamous
weather
the
prospect
of
that
horrid
gulf
between
boulogne
and
folkestone
would
have
been
as
nothing
to
brown
had
it
not
been
for
that
settled
look
of
anguish
which
had
now
pervaded
her
husband
s
face
if
you
don
t
find
something
to
relieve
me
i
shall
never
live
through
it
he
said
again
sinking
back
into
the
questionable
comfort
of
a
parisian
hotel
but
my
dear
what
can
i
do
she
asked
almost
in
tears
standing
over
him
and
caressing
him
he
was
a
thin
man
with
a
fine
long
soft
brown
beard
a
little
bald
at
the
top
of
the
head
but
certainly
a
man
she
loved
him
dearly
and
in
her
softer
moods
was
apt
to
spoil
him
with
her
caresses
what
can
i
do
my
dearie
you
know
i
would
do
anything
if
i
could
get
into
bed
my
pet
and
be
warm
and
then
morning
you
will
be
all
at
this
moment
he
was
preparing
himself
for
his
bed
and
she
was
assisting
him
then
she
tied
a
piece
of
flannel
round
his
throat
and
kissed
him
and
put
him
in
beneath
the
i
ll
tell
you
what
you
can
do
he
said
very
hoarsely
his
voice
was
so
bad
now
that
she
could
hardly
hear
him
so
she
crept
close
to
him
and
bent
over
him
she
would
do
anything
if
he
would
only
say
what
then
he
told
her
what
was
his
plan
down
in
the
salon
he
had
seen
a
large
jar
of
mustard
standing
on
a
sideboard
as
he
left
the
room
he
had
observed
that
this
had
not
been
withdrawn
with
the
other
appurtenances
of
the
meal
if
she
could
manage
to
find
her
way
down
there
taking
with
her
a
handkerchief
folded
for
the
purpose
and
if
she
could
then
appropriate
a
part
of
the
contents
of
that
jar
and
returning
with
her
prize
apply
it
to
his
throat
he
thought
that
he
could
get
some
relief
so
that
he
might
be
able
to
leave
his
bed
the
next
morning
at
five
but
i
am
afraid
it
will
be
very
disagreeable
for
you
to
go
down
all
alone
at
this
time
of
night
he
croaked
out
in
a
piteous
whisper
of
course
i
ll
go
said
she
i
don
t
mind
going
in
the
least
nobody
will
bite
me
and
she
at
once
began
to
fold
a
clean
handkerchief
i
won
t
be
two
minutes
my
darling
and
if
there
is
a
grain
of
mustard
in
the
house
i
ll
have
it
on
your
chest
she
was
a
woman
not
easily
cowed
and
the
journey
down
into
the
salon
was
nothing
to
her
before
she
went
she
tucked
the
clothes
carefully
up
to
his
ears
and
then
she
started
to
run
along
the
first
corridor
till
she
came
to
a
flight
of
stairs
was
easy
enough
and
easy
enough
to
descend
them
then
there
was
another
corridor
and
another
flight
and
a
third
corridor
and
a
third
flight
and
she
began
to
think
that
she
was
wrong
she
found
herself
in
a
part
of
the
hotel
which
she
had
not
hitherto
visited
and
soon
discovered
by
looking
through
an
open
door
or
two
that
she
had
found
her
way
among
a
set
of
private
which
she
had
not
seen
before
then
she
tried
to
make
her
way
back
up
the
same
stairs
and
through
the
same
passages
so
that
she
might
start
again
she
was
beginning
to
think
that
she
had
lost
herself
altogether
and
that
she
would
be
able
to
find
neither
the
salon
nor
her
bedroom
when
she
happily
met
the
she
was
dressed
in
a
loose
white
with
a
white
net
over
her
loose
hair
and
with
white
worsted
slippers
i
ought
perhaps
to
have
described
her
personal
appearance
sooner
she
was
a
large
woman
with
a
commanding
bust
thought
by
some
to
be
handsome
after
the
manner
of
juno
but
with
strangers
there
was
a
certain
severity
of
manner
about
her
a
fortification
as
it
were
of
her
virtue
against
all
possible
attacks
a
declared
determination
to
maintain
at
all
points
the
beautiful
character
of
a
british
matron
which
much
as
it
had
been
appreciated
at
thompson
hall
had
met
with
some
criticism
among
french
men
and
women
at
pau
she
had
been
called
la
fiÃ¨re
anglaise
the
name
had
reached
her
own
ears
and
those
of
her
husband
he
had
been
much
annoyed
but
she
had
taken
it
in
good
part
had
indeed
been
somewhat
proud
of
the
title
and
had
endeavoured
to
live
up
to
it
with
her
husband
she
could
on
occasion
be
soft
but
she
was
of
opinion
that
with
other
men
a
british
matron
should
be
stern
she
was
now
greatly
in
want
of
assistance
but
nevertheless
when
she
met
the
porter
she
remembered
her
character
i
have
lost
my
way
wandering
through
these
horrid
passages
she
said
in
her
severest
tone
this
was
in
answer
to
some
question
from
him
some
question
to
which
her
reply
was
given
very
slowly
then
when
he
asked
where
madame
wished
to
go
she
paused
again
thinking
what
destination
she
would
announce
no
doubt
the
man
could
take
her
back
to
her
bedroom
but
if
so
the
mustard
must
be
renounced
and
with
the
mustard
as
she
now
feared
all
hope
of
reaching
thompson
hall
on
christmas
eve
but
she
though
she
was
in
many
respects
a
brave
woman
did
not
dare
to
tell
the
man
that
she
was
prowling
about
the
hotel
in
order
that
she
might
make
a
midnight
raid
upon
the
mustard
pot
she
paused
therefore
for
a
moment
that
she
might
collect
her
thoughts
erecting
her
head
as
she
did
so
in
her
best
juno
fashion
till
the
porter
was
lost
in
admiration
thus
she
gained
time
to
fabricate
a
tale
she
had
she
said
dropped
her
handkerchief
under
the
would
he
show
her
the
way
to
the
salon
in
order
that
she
might
pick
it
up
but
the
porter
did
more
than
that
and
accompanied
her
to
the
room
in
which
she
had
supped
here
of
course
there
was
a
prolonged
and
it
need
hardly
be
said
a
vain
search
the
man
insisted
on
emptying
an
enormous
receptacle
of
soiled
and
on
turning
them
over
one
by
one
in
order
that
the
lady
s
property
might
be
found
the
lady
stood
by
unhappy
but
still
patient
and
as
the
man
was
stooping
to
his
work
her
eye
was
on
the
mustard
pot
there
it
was
capable
of
containing
enough
to
blister
the
throats
of
a
score
of
sufferers
she
edged
off
a
little
towards
it
while
the
man
was
busy
trying
to
persuade
herself
that
he
would
surely
forgive
her
if
she
took
the
mustard
and
told
him
her
whole
story
but
the
descent
from
her
juno
bearing
would
have
been
so
great
she
must
have
owned
not
only
to
the
quest
for
mustard
but
also
to
a
fib
and
she
could
not
do
it
the
porter
was
at
last
of
opinion
that
madame
must
have
made
a
mistake
and
madame
acknowledged
that
she
was
afraid
it
was
so
with
a
longing
lingering
eye
with
an
eye
turned
back
oh
so
sadly
to
the
great
jar
she
left
the
room
the
porter
leading
the
way
she
assured
him
that
she
could
find
it
by
herself
but
he
would
not
leave
her
till
he
had
put
her
on
to
the
proper
passage
the
journey
seemed
to
be
longer
now
even
than
before
but
as
she
ascended
the
many
stairs
she
swore
to
herself
that
she
would
not
even
yet
be
baulked
of
her
object
should
her
husband
want
comfort
for
his
poor
throat
and
the
comfort
be
there
within
her
reach
and
he
not
have
it
she
counted
every
stair
as
she
went
up
and
marked
every
turn
well
she
was
sure
now
that
she
would
know
the
way
and
that
she
could
return
to
the
room
without
fault
she
would
go
back
to
the
salon
even
though
the
man
should
encounter
her
again
she
would
go
boldly
forward
and
seize
the
remedy
which
her
poor
husband
so
grievously
required
ah
yes
she
said
when
the
porter
told
her
that
her
room
no
was
in
the
corridor
which
they
had
then
reached
i
know
it
all
now
i
am
so
much
obliged
do
not
come
a
step
he
was
anxious
to
accompany
her
up
to
the
very
door
but
she
stood
in
the
passage
and
prevailed
he
lingered
awhile
naturally
unluckily
she
had
brought
no
money
with
her
and
could
not
give
him
the
piece
which
he
had
earned
nor
could
she
fetch
it
from
her
room
feeling
that
were
she
to
return
to
her
husband
without
the
mustard
no
second
attempt
would
be
possible
the
disappointed
man
turned
on
his
heel
at
last
and
made
his
way
down
the
stairs
and
along
the
passage
it
seemed
to
her
to
be
almost
an
eternity
while
she
listened
to
his
still
audible
footsteps
she
had
gone
on
creeping
noiselessly
up
to
the
very
door
of
her
room
and
there
she
stood
shading
the
candle
in
her
hand
till
she
thought
that
the
man
must
have
wandered
away
into
some
furthest
corner
of
that
endless
building
then
she
turned
once
more
and
retraced
her
steps
there
was
no
difficulty
now
as
to
the
way
she
knew
it
every
stair
at
the
head
of
each
flight
she
stood
and
listened
but
not
a
sound
was
to
be
heard
and
then
she
went
on
again
her
heart
beat
high
with
anxious
desire
to
achieve
her
object
and
at
the
same
time
with
fear
what
might
have
been
explained
so
easily
at
first
would
now
be
as
difficult
of
explanation
at
last
she
was
in
the
great
public
vestibule
which
she
was
now
visiting
for
the
third
time
and
of
which
at
her
last
visit
she
had
taken
the
bearings
accurately
the
door
was
there
closed
indeed
but
it
opened
easily
to
the
hand
in
the
hall
and
on
the
stairs
and
along
the
passages
there
had
been
gas
but
here
there
was
no
light
beyond
that
given
by
the
little
taper
which
she
carried
when
accompanied
by
the
porter
she
had
not
feared
the
darkness
but
now
there
was
something
in
the
obscurity
which
made
her
dread
to
walk
the
length
of
the
room
up
to
the
mustard
jar
she
paused
and
listened
and
trembled
then
she
thought
of
the
glories
of
thompson
hall
of
the
genial
warmth
of
a
british
christmas
of
that
proud
legislator
who
was
her
first
cousin
and
with
a
rush
she
made
good
the
distance
and
laid
her
hand
upon
the
copious
delf
she
looked
round
but
there
was
no
one
there
no
sound
was
heard
not
the
distant
creak
of
a
shoe
not
a
rattle
from
one
of
those
thousand
doors
as
she
paused
with
her
fair
hand
upon
the
top
of
the
jar
while
the
other
held
the
white
cloth
on
which
the
medicinal
compound
was
to
be
placed
she
looked
like
lady
macbeth
as
she
listened
at
duncan
s
chamber
door
there
was
no
doubt
as
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
contents
the
jar
was
full
nearly
up
to
the
lips
the
mixture
was
no
doubt
very
different
from
that
good
wholesome
english
mustard
which
your
cook
makes
fresh
for
you
with
a
little
water
in
two
minutes
it
was
impregnated
with
a
sour
odour
and
was
to
english
eyes
unwholesome
of
colour
but
still
it
was
mustard
she
seized
the
horn
spoon
and
without
further
delay
spread
an
ample
sufficiency
on
the
folded
square
of
the
handkerchief
then
she
commenced
to
hurry
her
return
but
still
there
was
a
difficulty
no
thought
of
which
had
occurred
to
her
before
the
candle
occupied
one
hand
so
that
she
had
but
the
other
for
the
sustenance
of
her
treasure
had
she
brought
a
plate
or
saucer
from
the
salon
it
would
have
been
all
well
as
it
was
she
was
obliged
to
keep
her
eye
intent
on
her
right
hand
and
to
proceed
very
slowly
on
her
return
journey
she
was
surprised
to
find
what
an
aptitude
the
thing
had
to
slip
from
her
grasp
but
still
she
progressed
slowly
and
was
careful
not
to
miss
a
turning
at
last
she
was
safe
at
her
chamber
door
there
it
was
no
chapter
ii
brown
s
failure
with
her
eye
still
fixed
upon
her
burden
she
glanced
up
at
the
number
of
the
door
she
had
been
determined
all
through
not
to
forget
that
then
she
turned
the
latch
and
crept
in
the
chamber
also
was
dark
after
the
gaslight
on
the
stairs
but
that
was
so
much
the
better
she
herself
had
put
out
the
two
candles
on
the
before
she
had
left
her
husband
as
she
was
closing
the
door
behind
her
she
paused
and
could
hear
that
he
was
sleeping
she
was
well
aware
that
she
had
been
long
absent
quite
long
enough
for
a
man
to
fall
into
slumber
who
was
given
that
way
she
must
have
been
gone
she
thought
fully
an
hour
there
had
been
no
end
to
that
turning
over
of
napkins
which
she
had
so
well
known
to
be
altogether
vain
she
paused
at
the
centre
table
of
the
room
still
looking
at
the
mustard
which
she
now
delicately
dried
from
off
her
hand
she
had
had
no
idea
that
it
would
have
been
so
difficult
to
carry
so
light
and
so
small
an
affair
but
there
it
was
and
nothing
had
been
lost
she
took
some
small
instrument
from
the
and
with
the
handle
collected
the
flowing
fragments
into
the
centre
then
the
question
occurred
to
her
whether
as
her
husband
was
sleeping
so
sweetly
it
would
be
well
to
disturb
him
she
listened
again
and
felt
that
the
slight
murmur
of
a
snore
with
which
her
ears
were
regaled
was
altogether
free
from
any
real
malady
in
the
throat
then
it
occurred
to
her
that
after
all
fatigue
perhaps
had
only
made
him
cross
she
bethought
herself
how
during
the
whole
journey
she
had
failed
to
believe
in
his
illness
what
meals
he
had
eaten
how
thoroughly
he
had
been
able
to
enjoy
his
full
complement
of
cigars
and
then
that
glass
of
brandy
against
which
she
had
raised
her
voice
slightly
in
feminine
opposition
and
now
he
was
sleeping
there
like
an
infant
with
full
round
perfected
almost
sonorous
workings
of
the
throat
who
does
not
know
that
sound
almost
of
two
rusty
bits
of
iron
scratching
against
each
other
which
comes
from
a
suffering
windpipe
there
was
no
semblance
of
that
here
why
disturb
him
when
he
was
so
thoroughly
enjoying
that
rest
which
more
certainly
than
anything
else
would
fit
him
for
the
fatigue
of
the
morrow
s
journey
i
think
that
after
all
her
labour
she
would
have
left
the
pungent
cataplasm
on
the
table
and
have
crept
gently
into
bed
beside
him
had
not
a
thought
suddenly
struck
her
of
the
great
injury
he
had
been
doing
her
if
he
were
not
really
to
send
her
down
there
in
a
strange
hotel
wandering
among
the
passages
in
the
middle
of
the
night
subject
to
the
contumely
of
anyone
who
might
meet
her
on
a
commission
which
if
it
were
not
sanctified
by
absolute
necessity
would
be
so
thoroughly
objectionable
at
this
moment
she
hardly
did
believe
that
he
had
ever
really
been
let
him
have
the
cataplasm
if
not
as
a
remedy
then
as
a
punishment
it
could
at
any
rate
do
him
no
harm
it
was
with
an
idea
of
avenging
rather
than
of
justifying
the
past
labours
of
the
night
that
she
proceeded
at
once
to
quick
action
leaving
the
candle
on
the
table
so
that
she
might
steady
her
right
hand
with
the
left
she
hurried
stealthily
to
the
bedside
even
though
he
was
behaving
badly
to
her
she
would
not
cause
him
discomfort
by
waking
him
roughly
she
would
do
a
wife
s
duty
to
him
as
a
british
matron
should
she
would
not
only
put
the
warm
mixture
on
his
neck
but
would
sit
carefully
by
him
for
twenty
minutes
so
that
she
might
relieve
him
from
it
when
the
proper
period
should
have
come
for
removing
the
counter
irritation
from
his
throat
there
would
doubtless
be
some
little
difficulty
in
this
in
collecting
the
mustard
after
it
had
served
her
purpose
had
she
been
at
home
surrounded
by
her
own
comforts
the
application
would
have
been
made
with
some
delicate
linen
bag
through
which
the
pungency
of
the
spice
would
have
penetrated
with
strength
sufficient
for
the
purpose
but
the
circumstance
of
the
occasion
had
not
admitted
this
she
had
she
felt
done
wonders
in
achieving
so
much
success
as
this
which
she
had
obtained
if
there
should
be
anything
disagreeable
in
the
operation
he
must
submit
to
it
he
had
asked
for
mustard
for
his
throat
and
mustard
he
should
have
as
these
thoughts
passed
quickly
through
her
mind
leaning
over
him
in
the
dark
with
her
eye
fixed
on
the
mixture
lest
it
should
slip
she
gently
raised
his
flowing
beard
with
her
left
hand
and
with
her
other
inverted
rapidly
steadily
but
very
softly
fixed
the
handkerchief
on
his
throat
from
the
bottom
of
his
chin
to
the
spot
at
which
the
collar
bones
meeting
together
form
the
orifice
of
the
chest
it
covered
the
whole
noble
expanse
there
was
barely
time
for
a
glance
but
never
had
she
been
more
conscious
of
the
grand
proportions
of
that
manly
throat
a
sweet
feeling
of
pity
came
upon
her
causing
her
to
determine
to
relieve
his
sufferings
in
the
shorter
space
of
fifteen
minutes
he
had
been
lying
on
his
back
with
his
lips
apart
and
as
she
held
back
his
beard
that
and
her
hand
nearly
covered
the
features
of
his
face
but
he
made
no
violent
effort
to
free
himself
from
the
encounter
he
did
not
even
move
an
arm
or
a
leg
he
simply
emitted
a
snore
louder
than
any
that
had
come
before
she
was
aware
that
it
was
not
his
wont
to
be
so
loud
that
there
was
generally
something
more
delicate
and
perhaps
more
querulous
in
his
nocturnal
voice
but
then
the
present
circumstances
were
exceptional
she
dropped
the
beard
very
softly
and
there
on
the
pillow
before
her
lay
the
face
of
a
stranger
she
had
put
the
mustard
plaster
on
the
wrong
man
not
priam
wakened
in
the
dead
of
night
not
dido
when
first
she
learned
that
Ã¦neas
had
fled
not
othello
when
he
learned
that
desdemona
had
been
chaste
not
medea
when
she
became
conscious
of
her
slaughtered
children
could
have
been
more
struck
with
horror
than
was
this
british
matron
as
she
stood
for
a
moment
gazing
with
awe
on
that
stranger
s
bed
one
vain
snatching
grasp
she
made
at
the
handkerchief
and
then
drew
back
her
hand
if
she
were
to
touch
him
would
he
not
wake
at
once
and
find
her
standing
there
in
his
bedroom
and
then
how
could
she
explain
it
by
what
words
could
she
so
quickly
make
him
know
the
circumstances
of
that
strange
occurrence
that
he
should
accept
it
all
before
he
had
said
a
word
that
might
offend
her
for
a
moment
she
stood
all
but
paralyzed
after
that
faint
ineffectual
movement
of
her
arm
then
he
stirred
his
head
uneasily
on
the
pillow
opened
wider
his
lips
and
twice
in
rapid
succession
snored
louder
than
before
she
started
back
a
couple
of
paces
and
with
her
body
placed
between
him
and
the
candle
with
her
face
averted
but
with
her
hand
still
resting
on
the
foot
of
the
bed
she
endeavoured
to
think
what
duty
required
of
her
she
had
injured
the
man
though
she
had
done
it
most
unwittingly
there
could
be
no
doubt
but
that
she
had
injured
him
if
for
a
moment
she
could
be
brave
the
injury
might
in
truth
be
little
but
how
disastrous
might
be
the
consequences
if
she
were
now
in
her
cowardice
to
leave
him
who
could
tell
applied
for
fifteen
to
twenty
minutes
a
mustard
plaster
may
be
the
salvation
of
a
throat
ill
at
ease
but
if
left
there
throughout
the
night
upon
the
neck
of
a
strong
man
ailing
nothing
only
too
prone
in
his
strength
to
slumber
soundly
how
sad
how
painful
for
aught
she
knew
how
dangerous
might
be
the
effects
and
surely
it
was
an
error
which
any
man
with
a
heart
in
his
bosom
would
pardon
judging
from
what
little
she
had
seen
of
him
she
thought
that
he
must
have
a
heart
in
his
bosom
was
it
not
her
duty
to
wake
him
and
then
quietly
to
extricate
him
from
the
embarrassment
which
she
had
brought
upon
him
but
in
doing
this
what
words
should
she
use
how
should
she
wake
him
how
should
she
make
him
understand
her
goodness
her
beneficence
her
sense
of
duty
before
he
should
have
jumped
from
the
bed
and
rushed
to
the
bell
and
have
summoned
all
above
and
all
below
to
the
rescue
sir
sir
do
not
move
do
not
stir
do
not
scream
i
have
put
a
mustard
plaster
on
your
throat
thinking
that
you
were
my
husband
as
yet
no
harm
has
been
done
let
me
take
it
off
and
then
hold
your
peace
for
where
is
the
man
of
such
native
constancy
and
grace
of
spirit
that
at
the
first
moment
of
waking
with
a
shock
he
could
hear
these
words
from
the
mouth
of
an
unknown
woman
by
his
bedside
and
at
once
obey
them
to
the
letter
would
he
not
surely
jump
from
his
bed
with
that
horrid
compound
falling
about
him
from
which
there
could
be
no
complete
relief
unless
he
would
keep
his
present
attitude
without
a
motion
the
picture
which
presented
itself
to
her
mind
as
to
his
probable
conduct
was
so
terrible
that
she
found
herself
unable
to
incur
the
risk
then
an
idea
presented
itself
to
her
mind
we
all
know
how
in
a
moment
quick
thoughts
will
course
through
the
subtle
brain
she
would
find
that
porter
and
send
him
to
explain
it
all
there
should
be
no
concealment
now
she
would
tell
the
story
and
would
bid
him
to
find
the
necessary
aid
alas
as
she
told
herself
that
she
would
do
so
she
knew
well
that
she
was
only
running
from
the
danger
which
it
was
her
duty
to
encounter
once
again
she
put
out
her
hand
as
though
to
return
along
the
bed
then
thrice
he
snorted
louder
than
before
and
moved
up
his
knee
uneasily
beneath
the
clothes
as
though
the
sharpness
of
the
mustard
were
already
working
upon
his
skin
she
watched
him
for
a
moment
longer
and
then
with
the
candle
in
her
hand
she
fled
poor
human
nature
had
he
been
an
old
man
even
a
man
she
would
not
have
left
him
to
his
unmerited
sufferings
as
it
was
though
she
completely
recognised
her
duty
and
knew
what
justice
and
goodness
demanded
of
her
she
could
not
do
it
but
there
was
still
left
to
her
that
plan
of
sending
the
to
him
it
was
not
till
she
was
out
of
the
room
and
had
gently
closed
the
door
behind
her
that
she
began
to
bethink
herself
how
she
had
made
the
mistake
with
a
glance
of
her
eye
she
looked
up
and
then
saw
the
number
on
the
door
remarking
to
herself
with
a
briton
s
natural
criticism
on
things
french
that
those
horrid
foreigners
do
not
know
how
to
make
their
figures
she
scudded
rather
than
ran
along
the
corridor
and
then
down
some
stairs
and
along
another
passage
so
that
she
might
not
be
found
in
the
neighbourhood
should
the
poor
man
in
his
agony
rush
rapidly
from
his
bed
in
the
confusion
of
her
first
escape
she
hardly
ventured
to
look
for
her
own
passage
nor
did
she
in
the
least
know
how
she
had
lost
her
way
when
she
came
upstairs
with
the
mustard
in
her
hand
but
at
the
present
moment
her
chief
object
was
the
she
went
on
descending
till
she
came
again
to
that
vestibule
and
looking
up
at
the
clock
saw
that
it
was
now
past
one
it
was
not
yet
midnight
when
she
left
her
husband
but
she
was
not
at
all
astonished
at
the
lapse
of
time
it
seemed
to
her
as
though
she
had
passed
a
night
among
these
miseries
and
oh
what
a
night
but
there
was
yet
much
to
be
done
she
must
find
that
porter
and
then
return
to
her
own
suffering
husband
ah
what
now
should
she
say
to
him
if
he
should
really
be
ill
how
should
she
assuage
him
and
yet
how
more
than
ever
necessary
was
it
that
they
should
leave
that
hotel
early
in
the
morning
that
they
should
leave
paris
by
the
very
earliest
and
quickest
train
that
would
take
them
as
fugitives
from
their
present
dangers
the
door
of
the
salon
was
open
but
she
had
no
courage
to
go
in
search
of
a
second
supply
she
would
have
lacked
strength
to
carry
it
up
the
stairs
where
now
oh
where
was
that
man
from
the
vestibule
she
made
her
way
into
the
hall
but
everything
seemed
to
be
deserted
through
the
glass
she
could
see
a
light
in
the
court
beyond
but
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
endeavour
even
to
open
the
hall
doors
and
now
she
was
very
cold
chilled
to
her
very
bones
all
this
had
been
done
at
christmas
and
during
such
severity
of
weather
as
had
never
before
been
experienced
by
living
parisians
a
feeling
of
great
pity
for
herself
gradually
came
upon
her
what
wrong
had
she
done
that
she
should
be
so
grievously
punished
why
should
she
be
driven
to
wander
about
in
this
way
till
her
limbs
were
failing
her
and
then
so
absolutely
important
as
it
was
that
her
strength
should
support
her
in
the
morning
the
man
would
not
die
even
though
he
were
left
there
without
aid
to
rid
himself
of
the
cataplasm
as
best
he
might
was
it
absolutely
necessary
that
she
should
disgrace
herself
but
she
could
not
even
procure
the
means
of
disgracing
herself
if
that
telling
her
story
to
the
would
have
been
a
disgrace
she
did
not
find
him
and
at
last
resolved
to
make
her
way
back
to
her
own
room
without
further
quest
she
began
to
think
that
she
had
done
all
that
she
could
do
no
man
was
ever
killed
by
a
mustard
plaster
on
his
throat
his
discomfort
at
the
worst
would
not
be
worse
than
hers
had
been
or
too
probably
than
that
of
her
poor
husband
so
she
went
back
up
the
stairs
and
along
the
passages
and
made
her
way
on
this
occasion
to
the
door
of
her
room
without
any
difficulty
the
way
was
so
well
known
to
her
that
she
could
not
but
wonder
that
she
had
failed
before
but
now
her
hands
had
been
empty
and
her
eyes
had
been
at
her
full
command
she
looked
up
and
there
was
the
number
very
manifest
on
this
occasion
she
opened
the
door
most
gently
thinking
that
her
husband
might
be
sleeping
as
soundly
as
that
other
man
had
slept
and
she
crept
into
the
room
chapter
iii
brown
attempts
to
escape
but
her
husband
was
not
sleeping
he
was
not
even
in
bed
as
she
had
left
him
she
found
him
sitting
there
before
the
on
which
one
log
still
retained
a
spark
of
what
had
once
pretended
to
be
a
fire
nothing
more
wretched
than
his
appearance
could
be
imagined
there
was
a
single
lighted
candle
on
the
table
on
which
he
was
leaning
with
his
two
elbows
while
his
head
rested
between
his
hands
he
had
on
a
over
his
but
otherwise
was
not
clothed
he
shivered
audibly
or
rather
shook
himself
with
the
cold
and
made
the
table
to
chatter
as
she
entered
the
room
then
he
groaned
and
let
his
head
fall
from
his
hands
on
to
the
table
it
occurred
to
her
at
the
moment
as
she
recognised
the
tone
of
his
querulous
voice
and
as
she
saw
the
form
of
his
neck
that
she
must
have
been
deaf
and
blind
when
she
had
mistaken
that
stalwart
stranger
for
her
husband
oh
my
dear
she
said
why
are
you
not
in
bed
he
answered
nothing
in
words
but
only
groaned
again
why
did
you
get
up
i
left
you
warm
and
where
have
you
been
all
night
he
half
whispered
half
croaked
with
an
agonising
effort
i
have
been
looking
for
the
have
been
looking
all
night
and
haven
t
found
it
where
have
you
been
she
refused
to
speak
a
word
to
him
till
she
had
got
him
into
bed
and
then
she
told
her
story
but
alas
that
which
she
told
was
not
the
true
story
as
she
was
persuading
him
to
go
back
to
his
rest
and
while
she
arranged
the
clothes
again
around
him
she
with
difficulty
made
up
her
mind
as
to
what
she
would
do
and
what
she
would
say
living
or
dying
he
must
be
made
to
start
for
thompson
hall
at
five
on
the
next
morning
it
was
no
longer
a
question
of
the
amenities
of
christmas
no
longer
a
mere
desire
to
satisfy
the
family
ambition
of
her
own
people
no
longer
an
anxiety
to
see
her
new
she
was
conscious
that
there
was
in
that
house
one
whom
she
had
deeply
injured
and
from
whose
vengeance
even
from
whose
aspect
she
must
fly
how
could
she
endure
to
see
that
face
which
she
was
so
well
sure
that
she
would
recognise
or
to
hear
the
slightest
sound
of
that
voice
which
would
be
quite
familiar
to
her
ears
though
it
had
never
spoken
a
word
in
her
hearing
she
must
certainly
fly
on
the
wings
of
the
earliest
train
which
would
carry
her
towards
the
old
house
but
in
order
that
she
might
do
so
she
must
propitiate
her
husband
so
she
told
her
story
she
had
gone
forth
as
he
had
bade
her
in
search
of
the
mustard
and
then
had
suddenly
lost
her
way
up
and
down
the
house
she
had
wandered
perhaps
nearly
a
dozen
times
had
she
met
no
one
he
asked
in
that
raspy
husky
whisper
surely
there
must
have
been
some
one
about
the
hotel
nor
was
it
possible
that
she
could
have
been
roaming
about
all
those
only
one
hour
my
dear
she
said
then
there
was
a
question
about
the
duration
of
time
in
which
both
of
them
waxed
angry
and
as
she
became
angry
her
husband
waxed
stronger
and
as
he
became
violent
beneath
the
clothes
the
comfortable
idea
returned
to
her
that
he
was
not
perhaps
so
ill
as
he
would
seem
to
be
she
found
herself
driven
to
tell
him
something
about
the
porter
having
to
account
for
that
lapse
of
time
by
explaining
how
she
had
driven
the
poor
man
to
search
for
the
handkerchief
which
she
had
never
lost
why
did
you
not
tell
him
you
wanted
the
mustard
my
dear
why
not
there
is
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
in
wanting
at
one
o
clock
in
the
morning
i
couldn
t
do
it
to
tell
you
the
truth
he
wasn
t
very
civil
and
i
thought
that
he
was
perhaps
a
little
tipsy
now
my
dear
do
go
to
why
didn
t
you
get
the
mustard
there
was
none
there
nowhere
at
all
about
the
room
i
went
down
again
and
searched
everywhere
that
s
what
took
me
so
long
they
always
lock
up
those
kind
of
things
at
these
french
hotels
they
are
too
to
leave
anything
out
when
you
first
spoke
of
it
i
knew
that
it
would
be
gone
when
i
got
there
now
my
dear
do
go
to
sleep
because
we
positively
must
start
in
the
that
is
impossible
said
he
jumping
up
in
bed
we
must
go
my
dear
i
say
that
we
must
go
after
all
that
has
passed
i
wouldn
t
not
be
with
uncle
john
and
my
cousin
robert
evening
for
more
more
more
than
i
would
venture
to
bother
he
exclaimed
it
s
all
very
well
for
you
to
say
that
charles
but
you
don
t
know
i
say
that
we
must
go
and
we
i
do
believe
you
want
to
kill
me
that
is
very
cruel
charles
and
most
false
and
most
unjust
as
for
making
you
ill
nothing
could
be
so
bad
for
you
as
this
wretched
place
where
nobody
can
get
warm
either
day
or
night
if
anything
will
cure
your
throat
for
you
at
once
it
will
be
the
sea
air
and
only
think
how
much
more
comfortable
they
can
make
you
at
thompson
hall
than
anywhere
in
this
country
i
have
so
set
my
heart
upon
it
charles
that
i
will
do
it
if
we
are
not
there
night
uncle
john
won
t
consider
us
as
belonging
to
the
i
don
t
believe
a
word
of
jane
told
me
so
in
her
letter
i
wouldn
t
let
you
know
before
because
i
thought
it
so
unjust
but
that
has
been
the
reason
why
i
ve
been
so
earnest
about
it
all
it
was
a
thousand
pities
that
so
good
a
woman
should
have
been
driven
by
the
sad
stress
of
circumstances
to
tell
so
many
fibs
one
after
another
she
was
compelled
to
invent
them
that
there
might
be
a
way
open
to
her
of
escaping
the
horrors
of
a
prolonged
sojourn
in
that
hotel
at
length
after
much
grumbling
he
became
silent
and
she
trusted
that
he
was
sleeping
he
had
not
as
yet
said
that
he
would
start
at
the
required
hour
in
the
morning
but
she
was
perfectly
determined
in
her
own
mind
that
he
should
be
made
to
do
so
as
he
lay
there
motionless
and
as
she
wandered
about
the
room
pretending
to
pack
her
things
she
more
than
once
almost
resolved
that
she
would
tell
him
everything
surely
then
he
would
be
ready
to
make
any
effort
but
there
came
upon
her
an
idea
that
he
might
perhaps
fail
to
see
all
the
circumstances
and
that
so
failing
he
would
insist
on
remaining
that
he
might
tender
some
apology
to
the
injured
gentleman
an
apology
might
have
been
very
well
had
she
not
left
him
there
in
his
misery
but
what
apology
would
be
possible
now
she
would
have
to
see
him
and
speak
to
him
and
everyone
in
the
hotel
would
know
every
detail
of
the
story
everyone
in
france
would
know
that
it
was
she
who
had
gone
to
the
strange
man
s
bedside
and
put
the
mustard
plaster
on
the
strange
man
s
throat
in
the
dead
of
night
she
could
not
tell
the
story
even
to
her
husband
lest
even
her
husband
should
betray
her
her
own
sufferings
at
the
present
moment
were
not
light
in
her
perturbation
of
mind
she
had
foolishly
resolved
that
she
would
not
herself
go
to
bed
the
tragedy
of
the
night
had
seemed
to
her
too
deep
for
personal
comfort
and
then
how
would
it
be
were
she
to
sleep
and
have
no
one
to
call
her
it
was
imperative
that
she
should
have
all
her
powers
ready
for
thoroughly
arousing
him
it
occurred
to
her
that
the
servant
of
the
hotel
would
certainly
run
her
too
short
of
time
she
had
to
work
for
herself
and
for
him
too
and
therefore
she
would
not
sleep
but
she
was
very
cold
and
she
put
on
first
a
shawl
over
her
and
then
a
cloak
she
could
not
consume
all
the
remaining
hours
of
the
night
in
packing
one
bag
and
one
portmanteau
so
that
at
last
she
sat
down
on
the
narrow
red
cotton
velvet
sofa
and
looking
at
her
watch
perceived
that
as
yet
it
was
not
much
past
two
o
clock
how
was
she
to
get
through
those
other
three
long
tedious
chilly
hours
then
there
came
a
voice
from
the
bed
ain
t
you
coming
i
hoped
you
were
asleep
my
i
haven
t
been
asleep
at
all
you
d
better
come
if
you
don
t
mean
to
make
yourself
as
ill
as
i
you
are
not
so
very
bad
are
you
darling
i
don
t
know
what
you
call
bad
i
never
felt
my
throat
so
choked
in
my
life
before
still
as
she
listened
she
thought
that
she
remembered
his
throat
to
have
been
more
choked
if
the
husband
of
her
bosom
could
play
with
her
feelings
and
deceive
her
on
such
an
occasion
as
this
then
then
then
she
thought
that
she
would
rather
not
have
any
husband
of
her
bosom
at
all
but
she
did
creep
into
bed
and
lay
down
beside
him
without
saying
another
word
of
course
she
slept
but
her
sleep
was
not
the
sleep
of
the
blest
at
every
striking
of
the
clock
in
the
quadrangle
she
would
start
up
in
alarm
fearing
that
she
had
let
the
time
go
by
though
the
night
was
so
short
it
was
very
long
to
her
but
he
slept
like
an
infant
she
could
hear
from
his
breathing
that
he
was
not
quite
so
well
as
she
could
wish
him
to
be
but
still
he
was
resting
in
beautiful
tranquillity
not
once
did
he
move
when
she
started
up
as
she
did
so
frequently
orders
had
been
given
and
repeated
over
and
over
again
that
they
should
be
called
at
five
the
man
in
the
office
had
almost
been
angry
as
he
assured
brown
for
the
fourth
time
that
monsieur
and
madame
would
most
assuredly
be
wakened
at
the
appointed
time
but
still
she
would
trust
to
no
one
and
was
up
and
about
the
room
before
the
clock
had
struck
four
in
her
heart
of
hearts
she
was
very
tender
towards
her
husband
now
in
order
that
he
might
feel
a
gleam
of
warmth
while
he
was
dressing
himself
she
collected
together
the
fragments
of
wood
and
endeavoured
to
make
a
little
fire
then
she
took
out
from
her
bag
a
small
pot
and
a
patent
lamp
and
some
chocolate
and
prepared
for
him
a
warm
drink
so
that
he
might
have
it
instantly
as
he
was
awakened
she
would
do
anything
for
him
in
the
way
of
ministering
to
his
comfort
only
he
must
go
yes
he
certainly
must
go
and
then
she
wondered
how
that
strange
man
was
bearing
himself
at
the
present
moment
she
would
fain
have
ministered
to
him
too
had
it
been
possible
but
ah
it
was
so
impossible
probably
before
this
he
would
have
been
aroused
from
his
troubled
slumbers
but
then
how
aroused
at
what
time
in
the
night
would
the
burning
heat
upon
his
chest
have
awakened
him
to
a
sense
of
torture
which
must
have
been
so
altogether
incomprehensible
to
him
her
strong
imagination
showed
to
her
a
clear
picture
of
the
scene
clear
though
it
must
have
been
done
in
the
dark
how
he
must
have
tossed
and
hurled
himself
under
the
clothes
how
those
strong
knees
must
have
worked
themselves
up
and
down
before
the
potent
god
of
sleep
would
allow
him
to
return
to
perfect
consciousness
how
his
fingers
restrained
by
no
reason
would
have
trampled
over
his
feverish
throat
scattering
everywhere
that
unhappy
poultice
then
when
he
should
have
sat
up
wide
awake
but
still
in
the
dark
with
her
mind
s
eye
she
saw
it
all
feeling
that
some
fire
as
from
the
infernal
regions
had
fallen
upon
him
but
whence
he
would
know
not
how
fiercely
wild
would
be
the
working
of
his
spirit
ah
now
she
knew
now
she
felt
now
she
acknowledged
how
bound
she
had
been
to
awaken
him
at
the
moment
whatever
might
have
been
the
personal
inconvenience
to
herself
in
such
a
position
what
would
he
do
or
rather
what
had
he
done
she
could
follow
much
of
it
in
her
own
thoughts
how
he
would
scramble
madly
from
his
bed
and
with
one
hand
still
on
his
throat
would
snatch
hurriedly
at
the
matches
with
the
other
how
the
light
would
come
and
how
then
he
would
rush
to
the
mirror
ah
what
a
sight
he
would
behold
she
could
see
it
all
to
the
last
widespread
daub
but
she
could
not
see
she
could
not
tell
herself
what
in
such
a
position
a
man
would
do
at
any
rate
not
what
that
man
would
do
her
husband
she
thought
would
tell
his
wife
and
then
the
two
of
them
between
them
would
put
up
with
it
there
are
misfortunes
which
if
they
be
published
are
simply
aggravated
by
ridicule
but
she
remembered
the
features
of
the
stranger
as
she
had
seen
them
at
that
instant
in
which
she
had
dropped
his
beard
and
she
thought
that
there
was
a
ferocity
in
them
a
certain
tenacity
of
which
would
not
permit
their
owner
to
endure
such
treatment
in
silence
would
he
not
storm
and
rage
and
ring
the
bell
and
call
all
paris
to
witness
his
revenge
but
the
storming
and
the
raging
had
not
reached
her
yet
and
now
it
wanted
but
a
quarter
to
five
in
of
an
hour
they
would
be
in
that
which
they
had
ordered
for
themselves
and
in
half
an
hour
after
that
they
would
be
flying
towards
thompson
hall
then
she
allowed
herself
to
think
of
the
coming
comforts
of
those
comforts
so
sweet
if
only
they
would
come
that
very
day
now
present
to
her
was
the
december
and
on
that
very
evening
she
would
be
sitting
in
christmas
joy
among
all
her
uncles
and
cousins
holding
her
new
affectionately
by
the
hand
oh
what
a
change
from
pandemonium
to
paradise
from
that
wretched
room
from
that
miserable
house
in
which
there
was
such
ample
cause
for
fear
to
all
the
domestic
christmas
bliss
of
the
home
of
the
thompsons
she
resolved
that
she
would
not
at
any
rate
be
deterred
by
any
light
opposition
on
the
part
of
her
husband
it
wants
just
a
quarter
to
five
she
said
putting
her
hand
steadily
upon
his
shoulder
and
i
ll
get
a
cup
of
chocolate
for
you
so
that
you
may
get
up
i
ve
been
thinking
about
it
he
said
rubbing
his
eyes
with
the
back
of
his
hands
it
will
be
so
much
better
to
go
over
by
the
mail
train
we
should
be
in
time
for
christmas
just
the
that
will
not
do
at
all
she
answered
energetically
come
charles
after
all
the
trouble
do
not
disappoint
it
is
such
a
horrid
think
what
i
have
gone
through
what
i
have
done
for
you
in
twelve
hours
we
shall
be
there
among
them
all
you
won
t
be
so
little
like
a
man
as
not
to
go
on
he
threw
himself
back
upon
the
bed
and
tried
to
readjust
the
clothes
round
his
neck
no
charles
no
she
continued
not
if
i
know
it
take
your
chocolate
and
get
up
there
is
not
a
moment
to
be
with
that
she
laid
her
hand
upon
his
shoulder
and
made
him
clearly
understand
that
he
would
not
be
allowed
to
take
further
rest
in
that
bed
grumbling
sulky
coughing
continually
and
declaring
that
life
under
such
circumstances
was
not
worth
having
he
did
at
last
get
up
and
dress
himself
when
once
she
knew
that
he
was
obeying
her
she
became
again
tender
to
him
and
certainly
took
much
more
than
her
own
share
of
the
trouble
of
the
proceedings
long
before
the
time
was
up
she
was
ready
and
the
porter
had
been
summoned
to
take
the
luggage
downstairs
when
the
man
came
she
was
rejoiced
to
see
that
it
was
not
he
whom
she
had
met
among
the
passages
during
her
nocturnal
rambles
he
shouldered
the
box
and
told
them
that
they
would
find
coffee
and
bread
and
butter
in
the
small
below
i
told
you
that
it
would
be
so
when
you
would
boil
that
stuff
said
the
ungrateful
man
who
had
nevertheless
swallowed
the
hot
chocolate
when
it
was
given
to
him
they
followed
their
luggage
down
into
the
hall
but
as
she
went
at
every
step
the
lady
looked
around
her
she
dreaded
the
sight
of
that
porter
of
the
night
she
feared
lest
some
potential
authority
of
the
hotel
should
come
to
her
and
ask
her
some
horrid
question
but
of
all
her
fears
her
greatest
fear
was
that
there
should
arise
before
her
an
apparition
of
that
face
which
she
had
seen
recumbent
on
its
pillow
as
they
passed
the
door
of
the
great
salon
brown
looked
in
why
there
it
is
still
said
he
what
said
she
trembling
in
every
limb
the
they
have
put
it
in
there
since
she
exclaimed
energetically
in
her
despair
but
never
mind
the
omnibus
is
here
come
and
she
absolutely
took
him
by
the
arm
but
at
that
moment
a
door
behind
them
opened
and
brown
heard
herself
called
by
her
name
and
there
was
the
with
a
handkerchief
in
his
hand
but
the
further
doings
of
that
morning
must
be
told
in
a
further
chapter
chapter
iv
brown
does
escape
it
had
been
visible
to
brown
from
the
first
moment
of
her
arrival
on
the
ground
floor
that
something
was
the
matter
if
we
may
be
allowed
to
use
such
a
phrase
and
she
felt
all
but
convinced
that
this
something
had
reference
to
her
she
fancied
that
the
people
of
the
hotel
were
looking
at
her
as
she
swallowed
or
tried
to
swallow
her
coffee
when
her
husband
was
paying
the
bill
there
was
something
disagreeable
in
the
eye
of
the
man
who
was
taking
the
money
her
sufferings
were
very
great
and
no
one
sympathised
with
her
her
husband
was
quite
at
his
ease
except
that
he
was
complaining
of
the
cold
when
she
was
anxious
to
get
him
out
into
the
carriage
he
still
stood
there
leisurely
arranging
shawl
after
shawl
around
his
throat
you
can
do
that
quite
as
well
in
an
omnibus
she
had
just
said
to
him
very
crossly
when
there
appeared
upon
the
scene
through
a
side
door
that
very
whom
she
dreaded
with
a
soiled
in
his
hand
even
before
the
sound
of
her
own
name
met
her
ears
brown
knew
it
all
she
understood
the
full
horror
of
her
position
from
that
man
s
hostile
face
and
from
the
little
article
which
he
held
in
his
hand
if
during
the
watches
of
the
night
she
had
had
money
in
her
pocket
if
she
had
made
a
friend
of
this
greedy
fellow
by
liberality
all
might
have
been
so
different
but
she
reflected
that
she
had
allowed
him
to
go
unfee
d
after
all
his
trouble
and
she
knew
that
he
was
her
enemy
it
was
the
handkerchief
that
she
feared
she
thought
that
she
might
have
brazened
out
anything
but
that
no
one
had
seen
her
enter
or
leave
that
strange
man
s
room
no
one
had
seen
her
dip
her
hands
in
that
jar
she
had
no
doubt
been
found
wandering
about
the
house
while
the
slumberer
had
been
made
to
suffer
so
strangely
and
there
might
have
been
suspicion
and
perhaps
accusation
but
she
would
have
been
ready
with
frequent
protestations
to
deny
all
charges
made
against
her
and
though
no
one
might
have
believed
her
no
one
could
have
convicted
her
here
however
was
evidence
against
which
she
would
be
unable
to
stand
for
a
moment
at
the
first
glance
she
acknowledged
the
potency
of
that
damning
morsel
of
linen
during
all
the
horrors
of
the
night
she
had
never
given
a
thought
to
the
handkerchief
and
yet
she
ought
to
have
known
that
the
evidence
it
would
bring
against
her
was
palpable
and
certain
her
name
m
brown
was
plainly
written
on
the
corner
what
a
fool
she
had
been
not
to
have
thought
of
this
had
she
but
remembered
the
plain
marking
which
she
as
a
careful
british
matron
had
put
upon
all
her
clothes
she
would
at
any
hazard
have
recovered
the
article
oh
that
she
had
waked
the
man
or
bribed
the
porter
or
even
told
her
husband
but
now
she
was
as
it
were
friendless
without
support
without
a
word
that
she
could
say
in
her
own
defence
convicted
of
having
committed
this
assault
upon
a
strange
man
in
his
own
bedroom
and
then
of
having
left
him
the
thing
must
be
explained
by
the
truth
but
how
to
explain
such
truth
how
to
tell
such
story
in
a
way
to
satisfy
injured
folk
and
she
with
only
barely
time
sufficient
to
catch
the
train
then
it
occurred
to
her
that
they
could
have
no
legal
right
to
stop
her
because
the
had
been
found
in
a
strange
gentleman
s
bedroom
yes
it
is
mine
she
said
turning
to
her
husband
as
the
porter
with
a
loud
voice
asked
if
she
were
not
madame
brown
take
it
charles
and
come
brown
naturally
stood
still
in
astonishment
he
did
put
out
his
hand
but
the
porter
would
not
allow
the
evidence
to
pass
so
readily
out
of
his
custody
what
does
it
all
mean
asked
brown
a
gentleman
has
been
eh
eh
something
has
been
done
to
a
gentleman
in
his
bedroom
said
the
clerk
something
done
to
a
gentleman
repeated
brown
something
very
bad
indeed
said
the
porter
look
here
and
he
showed
the
condition
of
the
handkerchief
charles
we
shall
lose
the
train
said
the
affrighted
wife
what
the
mischief
does
it
all
mean
demanded
the
husband
did
madame
go
into
the
gentleman
s
room
asked
the
clerk
then
there
was
an
awful
silence
and
all
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
lady
what
does
it
all
mean
demanded
the
husband
did
you
go
into
anybody
s
room
i
did
said
brown
with
much
dignity
looking
round
upon
her
enemies
as
a
stag
at
bay
will
look
upon
the
hounds
which
are
attacking
him
give
me
the
but
the
quickly
put
it
behind
his
back
charles
we
can
not
allow
ourselves
to
be
delayed
you
shall
write
a
letter
to
the
keeper
of
the
hotel
explaining
it
then
she
essayed
to
swim
out
through
the
front
door
into
the
courtyard
in
which
the
vehicle
was
waiting
for
them
but
three
or
four
men
and
women
interposed
themselves
and
even
her
husband
did
not
seem
quite
ready
to
continue
his
journey
is
christmas
eve
said
brown
and
we
shall
not
be
at
thompson
hall
think
of
my
sister
why
did
you
go
into
the
man
s
bedroom
my
dear
whispered
brown
in
english
but
the
porter
heard
the
whisper
and
understood
the
language
the
porter
who
had
not
been
ye
es
vy
asked
the
porter
it
was
a
mistake
charles
there
is
not
a
moment
to
lose
i
can
explain
it
all
to
you
in
the
then
the
clerk
suggested
that
madame
had
better
postpone
her
journey
a
little
the
gentleman
upstairs
had
certainly
been
very
badly
treated
and
had
demanded
to
know
why
so
great
an
outrage
had
been
perpetrated
the
clerk
said
that
he
did
not
wish
to
send
for
the
police
here
brown
gasped
terribly
and
threw
herself
on
her
husband
s
shoulder
but
he
did
not
think
he
could
allow
the
party
to
go
till
the
gentleman
upstairs
had
received
some
satisfaction
it
had
now
become
clearly
impossible
that
the
journey
could
be
made
by
the
early
train
even
brown
gave
it
up
herself
and
demanded
of
her
husband
that
she
should
be
taken
back
to
her
own
bedroom
but
what
is
to
be
said
to
the
gentleman
asked
the
porter
of
course
it
was
impossible
that
brown
should
be
made
to
tell
her
story
there
in
the
presence
of
them
all
the
clerk
when
he
found
he
had
succeeded
in
preventing
her
from
leaving
the
house
was
satisfied
with
a
promise
from
brown
that
he
would
inquire
from
his
wife
what
were
these
mysterious
circumstances
and
would
then
come
down
to
the
office
and
give
some
explanation
if
it
were
necessary
he
would
see
the
strange
gentleman
whom
he
now
ascertained
to
be
a
certain
jones
returning
from
the
east
of
europe
he
learned
also
that
this
jones
had
been
most
anxious
to
travel
by
that
very
morning
train
which
he
and
his
wife
had
intended
to
use
that
jones
had
been
most
particular
in
giving
his
orders
accordingly
but
that
at
the
last
moment
he
had
declared
himself
to
be
unable
even
to
dress
himself
because
of
the
injury
which
had
been
done
him
during
the
night
when
brown
heard
this
from
the
clerk
just
before
he
was
allowed
to
take
his
wife
upstairs
while
she
was
sitting
on
a
sofa
in
a
corner
with
her
face
hidden
a
look
of
awful
gloom
came
over
his
own
countenance
what
could
it
be
that
his
wife
had
done
to
the
man
of
so
terrible
a
nature
you
had
better
come
up
with
me
he
said
to
her
with
marital
severity
and
the
poor
cowed
woman
went
with
him
tamely
as
might
have
done
some
patient
grizel
not
a
word
was
spoken
till
they
were
in
the
room
and
the
door
was
locked
now
said
he
what
does
it
all
mean
it
was
not
till
nearly
two
hours
had
passed
that
brown
came
down
the
stairs
very
slowly
turning
it
all
over
in
his
mind
he
had
now
gradually
heard
the
absolute
and
exact
truth
and
had
very
gradually
learned
to
believe
it
it
was
first
necessary
that
he
should
understand
that
his
wife
had
told
him
many
fibs
during
the
night
but
as
she
constantly
alleged
to
him
when
he
complained
of
her
conduct
in
this
respect
they
had
all
been
told
on
his
behalf
had
she
not
struggled
to
get
the
mustard
for
his
comfort
and
when
she
had
secured
the
prize
had
she
not
hurried
to
put
it
on
as
she
had
fondly
thought
his
throat
and
though
she
had
fibbed
to
him
afterwards
had
she
not
done
so
in
order
that
he
might
not
be
troubled
you
are
not
angry
with
me
because
i
was
in
that
man
s
room
she
asked
looking
full
into
his
eyes
but
not
quite
without
a
sob
he
paused
a
moment
and
then
declared
with
something
of
a
true
husband
s
confidence
in
his
tone
that
he
was
not
in
the
least
angry
with
her
on
that
account
then
she
kissed
him
and
bade
him
remember
that
after
all
no
one
could
really
injure
them
what
harm
has
been
done
charles
the
gentleman
won
t
die
because
he
has
had
a
mustard
plaster
on
his
throat
the
worst
is
about
uncle
john
and
dear
jane
they
do
think
so
much
of
christmas
eve
at
thompson
hall
brown
when
he
again
found
himself
in
the
clerk
s
office
requested
that
his
card
might
be
taken
up
to
jones
jones
had
sent
down
his
own
card
which
was
handed
to
brown
mr
barnaby
and
how
was
it
all
sir
asked
the
clerk
in
a
whisper
a
whisper
which
had
at
the
same
time
something
of
authoritative
demand
and
something
also
of
submissive
respect
the
clerk
of
course
was
anxious
to
know
the
mystery
it
is
hardly
too
much
to
say
that
everyone
in
that
vast
hotel
was
by
this
time
anxious
to
have
the
mystery
unravelled
but
brown
would
tell
nothing
to
anyone
it
is
merely
a
matter
to
be
explained
between
me
and
jones
he
said
the
card
was
taken
upstairs
and
after
awhile
he
was
ushered
into
jones
room
it
was
of
course
that
very
with
which
the
reader
is
already
acquainted
there
was
a
fire
burning
and
the
remains
of
jones
breakfast
were
on
the
table
he
was
sitting
in
his
and
slippers
with
his
shirt
open
in
the
front
and
a
silk
handkerchief
very
loosely
covering
his
throat
brown
as
he
entered
the
room
of
course
looked
with
considerable
anxiety
at
the
gentleman
of
whose
condition
he
had
heard
so
sad
an
account
but
he
could
only
observe
some
considerable
stiffness
of
movement
and
demeanour
as
jones
turned
his
head
round
to
greet
him
this
has
been
a
very
disagreeable
accident
jones
said
the
husband
of
the
lady
accident
i
don
t
know
how
it
could
have
been
an
accident
it
has
been
a
most
most
most
a
most
monstrous
er
er
i
must
say
interference
with
a
gentleman
s
privacy
and
personal
quite
so
jones
but
on
the
part
of
the
lady
who
is
my
wife
so
i
understand
i
myself
am
about
to
become
a
married
man
and
i
can
understand
what
your
feelings
must
be
i
wish
to
say
as
little
as
possible
to
harrow
here
brown
bowed
but
there
s
the
fact
she
did
do
she
thought
it
was
me
what
i
give
you
my
word
as
a
gentleman
jones
when
she
was
putting
that
mess
upon
you
she
thought
it
was
me
she
did
jones
looked
at
his
new
acquaintance
and
shook
his
head
he
did
not
think
it
possible
that
any
woman
would
make
such
a
mistake
as
that
i
had
a
very
bad
sore
throat
continued
brown
and
indeed
you
may
perceive
it
still
in
saying
this
he
perhaps
aggravated
a
little
the
sign
of
his
distemper
and
i
asked
brown
to
go
down
and
get
one
just
what
she
put
on
i
wish
you
d
had
it
said
jones
putting
his
hand
up
to
his
neck
i
wish
i
had
for
your
sake
as
well
as
mine
and
for
hers
poor
woman
i
don
t
know
when
she
will
get
over
the
i
don
t
know
when
i
shall
and
it
has
stopped
me
on
my
journey
i
was
to
have
been
this
very
night
this
christmas
eve
with
the
young
lady
i
am
engaged
to
marry
of
course
i
couldn
t
travel
the
extent
of
the
injury
done
nobody
can
imagine
at
it
has
been
just
as
bad
to
me
sir
we
were
to
have
been
with
our
family
this
christmas
eve
there
were
particular
reasons
most
particular
we
were
only
hindered
from
going
by
hearing
of
your
why
did
she
come
into
my
room
at
all
i
can
t
understand
that
a
lady
always
knows
her
own
room
at
an
that
s
yours
that
s
ours
don
t
you
see
how
easy
it
was
she
had
lost
her
way
and
she
was
a
little
afraid
lest
the
thing
should
fall
i
wish
it
had
with
all
my
that
s
how
it
was
now
i
m
sure
jones
you
ll
take
a
lady
s
apology
it
was
a
most
unfortunate
mistake
most
unfortunate
but
what
more
can
be
said
jones
gave
himself
up
to
reflection
for
a
few
moments
before
he
replied
to
this
he
supposed
that
he
was
bound
to
believe
the
story
as
far
as
it
went
at
any
rate
he
did
not
know
how
he
could
say
that
he
did
not
believe
it
it
seemed
to
him
to
be
almost
incredible
especially
incredible
in
regard
to
that
personal
mistake
for
except
that
they
both
had
long
beards
and
brown
beards
jones
thought
that
there
was
no
point
of
resemblance
between
himself
and
brown
but
still
even
that
he
felt
must
be
accepted
but
then
why
had
he
been
left
deserted
to
undergo
all
those
torments
she
found
out
her
mistake
at
last
i
suppose
oh
why
didn
t
she
wake
a
fellow
and
take
it
off
again
ah
she
can
t
have
cared
very
much
for
a
man
s
comfort
when
she
went
away
and
left
him
like
ah
there
was
the
difficulty
difficulty
who
was
it
that
had
done
it
to
come
to
me
in
my
bedroom
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
put
that
thing
on
me
and
then
leave
it
there
and
say
nothing
about
it
it
seems
to
me
deuced
like
a
practical
no
jones
that
s
the
way
i
look
at
it
said
jones
plucking
up
his
courage
there
isn
t
a
woman
in
all
england
or
in
all
france
less
likely
to
do
such
a
thing
than
my
wife
she
s
as
steady
as
a
rock
jones
and
would
no
more
go
into
another
gentleman
s
bedroom
in
joke
than
oh
dear
no
you
re
going
to
be
a
married
man
unless
all
this
makes
a
difference
said
jones
almost
in
tears
i
had
sworn
that
i
would
be
with
her
this
christmas
oh
jones
i
can
not
believe
that
will
interfere
with
your
happiness
how
could
you
think
that
your
wife
as
is
to
be
would
do
such
a
thing
as
that
in
joke
she
wouldn
t
do
it
at
all
joke
or
how
can
you
tell
what
accident
might
happen
to
anyone
she
d
have
wakened
the
man
then
afterwards
i
m
sure
she
would
she
would
never
have
left
him
to
suffer
in
that
way
her
heart
is
too
soft
why
didn
t
she
send
you
to
wake
me
and
explain
it
all
that
s
what
my
jane
would
have
done
and
i
should
have
gone
and
wakened
him
but
the
whole
thing
is
impossible
he
said
shaking
his
head
as
he
remembered
that
he
and
his
jane
were
not
in
a
condition
as
yet
to
undergo
any
such
mutual
trouble
at
last
jones
was
brought
to
acknowledge
that
nothing
more
could
be
done
the
lady
had
sent
her
apology
and
told
her
story
and
he
must
bear
the
trouble
and
inconvenience
to
which
she
had
subjected
him
he
still
however
had
his
own
opinion
about
her
conduct
generally
and
could
not
be
brought
to
give
any
sign
of
amity
he
simply
bowed
when
brown
was
hoping
to
induce
him
to
shake
hands
and
sent
no
word
of
pardon
to
the
great
offender
the
matter
however
was
so
far
concluded
that
there
was
no
further
question
of
police
interference
nor
any
doubt
but
that
the
lady
with
her
husband
was
to
be
allowed
to
leave
paris
by
the
night
train
the
nature
of
the
accident
probably
became
known
to
all
brown
was
interrogated
by
many
and
though
he
professed
to
declare
that
he
would
answer
no
question
nevertheless
he
found
it
better
to
tell
the
clerk
something
of
the
truth
than
to
allow
the
matter
to
be
shrouded
in
mystery
it
is
to
be
feared
that
jones
who
did
not
once
show
himself
through
the
day
but
who
employed
the
hours
in
endeavouring
to
assuage
the
injury
done
him
still
lived
in
the
convicsion
that
the
lady
had
played
a
practical
joke
on
him
but
the
subject
of
such
a
joke
never
talks
about
it
and
jones
could
not
be
induced
to
speak
even
by
the
friendly
adherence
of
the
brown
also
clung
to
the
seclusion
of
her
own
bedroom
never
once
stirring
from
it
till
the
time
came
in
which
she
was
to
be
taken
down
to
the
omnibus
upstairs
she
ate
her
meals
and
upstairs
she
passed
her
time
in
packing
and
unpacking
and
in
requesting
that
telegrams
might
be
sent
repeatedly
to
thompson
hall
in
the
course
of
the
day
two
such
telegrams
were
sent
in
the
latter
of
which
the
thompson
family
were
assured
that
the
browns
would
arrive
probably
in
time
for
breakfast
on
christmas
day
certainly
in
time
for
church
she
asked
more
than
once
tenderly
after
jones
welfare
but
could
obtain
no
information
he
was
very
cross
and
that
s
all
i
know
about
it
said
brown
then
she
made
a
remark
as
to
the
gentleman
s
christian
name
which
appeared
on
the
card
as
my
sister
s
husband
s
name
will
be
burnaby
she
said
and
this
man
s
christian
name
is
barnaby
that
s
all
the
difference
said
her
husband
with
jocularity
we
all
know
how
people
under
a
cloud
are
apt
to
fail
in
asserting
their
personal
dignity
on
the
former
day
a
separate
vehicle
had
been
ordered
by
brown
to
take
himself
and
his
wife
to
the
station
but
now
after
his
misfortunes
he
contented
himself
with
such
provision
as
the
people
at
the
hotel
might
make
for
him
at
the
appointed
hour
he
brought
his
wife
down
thickly
veiled
there
were
many
strangers
as
she
passed
through
the
hall
ready
to
look
at
the
lady
who
had
done
that
wonderful
thing
in
the
dead
of
night
but
none
could
see
a
feature
of
her
face
as
she
stepped
across
the
hall
and
was
hurried
into
the
omnibus
and
there
were
many
eyes
also
on
jones
who
followed
very
quickly
for
he
also
in
spite
of
his
sufferings
was
leaving
paris
on
the
evening
in
order
that
he
might
be
with
his
english
friends
on
christmas
day
he
as
he
went
through
the
crowd
assumed
an
air
of
great
dignity
to
which
perhaps
something
was
added
by
his
endeavours
as
he
walked
to
save
his
poor
throat
from
irritation
he
too
got
into
the
same
omnibus
stumbling
over
the
feet
of
his
enemy
in
the
dark
at
the
station
they
got
their
tickets
one
close
after
the
other
and
then
were
brought
into
each
other
s
presence
in
the
i
think
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
here
jones
was
conscious
not
only
of
her
presence
but
of
her
consciousness
of
his
presence
and
that
he
assumed
an
attitude
as
though
he
should
have
said
now
do
you
think
it
possible
for
me
to
believe
that
you
mistook
me
for
your
husband
she
was
perfectly
quiet
but
sat
through
that
quarter
of
an
hour
with
her
face
continually
veiled
brown
made
some
little
overture
of
conversation
to
jones
but
jones
though
he
did
mutter
some
reply
showed
plainly
enough
that
he
had
no
desire
for
further
intercourse
then
came
the
accustomed
stampede
the
awful
rush
the
internecine
struggle
in
which
seats
had
to
be
found
seats
i
fancy
are
regularly
found
even
by
the
most
tardy
but
it
always
appears
that
every
british
father
and
every
british
husband
is
actuated
at
these
stormy
moments
by
a
conviction
that
unless
he
proves
himself
a
very
hercules
he
and
his
daughters
and
his
wife
will
be
left
desolate
in
paris
brown
was
quite
herculean
carrying
two
bags
and
a
in
his
own
hands
besides
the
cloaks
the
coats
the
rugs
the
sticks
and
the
umbrellas
but
when
he
had
got
himself
and
his
wife
well
seated
with
their
faces
to
the
engine
with
a
corner
seat
for
her
there
was
jones
immediately
opposite
to
her
jones
as
soon
as
he
perceived
the
inconvenience
of
his
position
made
a
scramble
for
another
place
but
he
was
too
late
in
that
contiguity
the
journey
as
far
as
calais
had
to
be
made
she
poor
woman
never
once
took
up
her
veil
there
he
sat
without
closing
an
eye
stiff
as
a
ramrod
sometimes
showing
by
little
uneasy
gestures
that
the
trouble
at
his
neck
was
still
there
but
never
speaking
a
word
and
hardly
moving
a
limb
crossing
from
calais
to
dover
the
lady
was
of
course
separated
from
her
victim
the
passage
was
very
bad
and
she
more
than
once
reminded
her
husband
how
well
it
would
have
been
with
them
now
had
they
pursued
their
journey
as
she
had
intended
as
though
they
had
been
detained
in
paris
by
his
fault
jones
as
he
laid
himself
down
on
his
back
gave
himself
up
to
wondering
whether
any
man
before
him
had
ever
been
made
subject
to
such
absolute
injustice
now
and
again
he
put
his
hand
up
to
his
own
beard
and
began
to
doubt
whether
it
could
have
been
moved
as
it
must
have
been
moved
without
waking
him
what
if
chloroform
had
been
used
many
such
suspicions
crossed
his
mind
during
the
misery
of
that
passage
they
were
again
together
in
the
same
railway
carriage
from
dover
to
london
they
had
now
got
used
to
the
close
neighbourhood
and
knew
how
to
endure
each
the
presence
of
the
other
but
as
yet
jones
had
never
seen
the
lady
s
face
he
longed
to
know
what
were
the
features
of
the
woman
who
had
been
so
blind
if
indeed
that
story
were
true
or
if
it
were
not
true
of
what
like
was
the
woman
who
would
dare
in
the
middle
of
the
night
to
play
such
a
trick
as
that
but
still
she
kept
her
veil
close
over
her
face
from
cannon
street
the
browns
took
their
departure
in
a
cab
for
the
liverpool
street
station
whence
they
would
be
conveyed
by
the
eastern
counties
railway
to
stratford
now
at
any
rate
their
troubles
were
over
they
would
be
in
ample
time
not
only
for
christmas
day
church
but
for
christmas
day
breakfast
it
will
be
just
the
same
as
getting
in
there
last
night
said
brown
as
he
walked
across
the
platform
to
place
his
wife
in
the
carriage
for
stratford
she
entered
it
the
first
and
as
she
did
so
there
she
saw
jones
seated
in
the
corner
hitherto
she
had
borne
his
presence
well
but
now
she
could
not
restrain
herself
from
a
little
start
and
a
little
scream
he
bowed
his
head
very
slightly
as
though
acknowledging
the
compliment
and
then
down
she
dropped
her
veil
when
they
arrived
at
stratford
the
journey
being
over
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
jones
was
out
of
the
carriage
even
before
the
browns
there
is
uncle
john
s
carriage
said
brown
thinking
that
now
at
any
rate
she
would
be
able
to
free
herself
from
the
presence
of
this
terrible
stranger
no
doubt
he
was
a
handsome
man
to
look
at
but
on
no
face
so
sternly
hostile
had
she
ever
before
fixed
her
eyes
she
did
not
perhaps
reflect
that
the
owner
of
no
other
face
had
ever
been
so
deeply
injured
by
herself
chapter
brown
at
thompson
hall
please
sir
we
were
to
ask
for
jones
said
the
servant
putting
his
head
into
the
carriage
after
both
and
brown
had
seated
themselves
mr
jones
exclaimed
the
husband
why
ask
for
jones
demanded
the
wife
the
servant
was
about
to
tender
some
explanation
when
jones
stepped
up
and
said
that
he
was
jones
we
are
going
to
thompson
hall
said
the
lady
with
great
vigour
so
am
i
said
jones
with
much
dignity
it
was
however
arranged
that
he
should
sit
with
the
coachman
as
there
was
a
rumble
behind
for
the
other
servant
the
luggage
was
put
into
a
cart
and
away
all
went
for
thompson
hall
what
do
you
think
about
it
mary
whispered
brown
after
a
pause
he
was
evidently
by
the
horror
of
the
occasion
i
can
not
make
it
out
at
all
what
do
you
think
i
don
t
know
what
to
think
jones
going
to
thompson
hall
he
s
a
very
young
man
said
brown
well
that
s
as
people
think
a
stiff
fellow
i
should
say
up
to
this
moment
he
has
never
forgiven
you
for
what
you
did
to
would
you
have
forgiven
his
wife
charles
if
she
d
done
it
to
you
he
hasn
t
got
a
wife
how
do
you
know
he
is
coming
home
now
to
be
married
said
brown
he
expects
to
meet
the
young
lady
this
very
christmas
day
he
told
me
so
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
why
he
was
so
angry
at
being
stopped
by
what
you
did
last
i
suppose
he
knows
uncle
john
or
he
wouldn
t
be
going
to
the
hall
said
brown
i
can
t
make
it
out
said
brown
shaking
his
head
he
looks
quite
like
a
gentleman
said
brown
though
he
has
been
so
stiff
jones
barnaby
jones
you
re
sure
it
was
barnaby
that
was
the
name
on
the
not
burnaby
asked
brown
it
was
barnaby
jones
on
the
card
just
the
same
as
barnaby
rudge
and
as
for
looking
like
a
gentleman
i
m
by
no
means
quite
so
sure
a
gentleman
takes
an
apology
when
it
s
perhaps
my
dear
that
depends
on
the
condition
of
his
throat
if
you
had
had
a
mustard
plaster
on
all
night
you
might
not
have
liked
it
but
here
we
are
at
thompson
hall
at
thompson
hall
was
an
old
brick
mansion
standing
within
a
huge
iron
gate
with
a
gravel
sweep
before
it
it
had
stood
there
before
stratford
was
a
town
or
even
a
suburb
and
had
then
been
known
by
the
name
of
bow
place
but
it
had
been
in
the
hands
of
the
present
family
for
the
last
thirty
years
and
was
now
known
far
and
wide
as
thompson
hall
a
comfortable
roomy
place
perhaps
a
little
dark
and
dull
to
look
at
but
much
more
substantially
built
than
most
of
our
modern
villas
brown
jumped
with
alacrity
from
the
carriage
and
with
a
quick
step
entered
the
home
of
her
forefathers
her
husband
followed
her
more
leisurely
but
he
too
felt
that
he
was
at
home
at
thompson
hall
then
jones
walked
in
also
but
he
looked
as
though
he
were
not
at
all
at
home
it
was
still
very
early
and
no
one
of
the
family
was
as
yet
down
in
these
circumstances
it
was
almost
necessary
that
something
should
be
said
to
jones
do
you
know
thompson
asked
brown
i
never
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
him
as
yet
answered
jones
very
stiffly
oh
i
didn
t
know
because
you
said
you
were
coming
and
i
have
come
here
are
you
friends
of
thompson
oh
dear
yes
said
brown
i
was
a
thompson
myself
before
i
oh
indeed
said
jones
how
very
odd
very
odd
during
this
time
the
luggage
was
being
brought
into
the
house
and
two
old
family
servants
were
offering
them
assistance
would
the
new
comers
like
to
go
up
to
their
bedrooms
then
the
housekeeper
green
intimated
with
a
wink
that
miss
jane
would
she
was
sure
be
down
quite
immediately
the
present
moment
however
was
still
very
unpleasant
the
lady
probably
had
made
her
guess
as
to
the
mystery
but
the
two
gentlemen
were
still
altogether
in
the
dark
brown
had
no
doubt
declared
her
parentage
but
jones
with
such
a
multitude
of
strange
facts
crowding
on
his
mind
had
been
slow
to
understand
her
being
somewhat
suspicious
by
nature
he
was
beginning
to
think
whether
possibly
the
mustard
had
been
put
by
this
lady
on
his
throat
with
some
reference
to
his
connexion
with
thompson
hall
could
it
be
that
she
for
some
reason
of
her
own
had
wished
to
prevent
his
coming
and
had
contrived
this
untoward
stratagem
out
of
her
brain
or
had
she
wished
to
make
him
ridiculous
to
the
thompson
family
to
whom
as
a
family
he
was
at
present
unknown
it
was
becoming
more
and
more
improbable
to
him
that
the
whole
thing
should
have
been
an
accident
when
after
the
first
horrid
torments
of
that
morning
in
which
he
had
in
his
agony
invoked
the
assistance
of
the
he
had
begun
to
reflect
on
his
situation
he
had
determined
that
it
would
be
better
that
nothing
further
should
be
said
about
it
what
would
life
be
worth
to
him
if
he
were
to
be
known
wherever
he
went
as
the
man
who
had
been
in
the
middle
of
the
night
by
a
strange
lady
the
worst
of
a
practical
joke
is
that
the
remembrance
of
the
absurd
condition
sticks
so
long
to
the
sufferer
at
the
hotel
that
who
had
possessed
himself
of
the
handkerchief
and
had
read
the
name
and
had
connected
that
name
with
the
occupant
of
whom
he
had
found
wandering
about
the
house
with
some
strange
purpose
had
not
permitted
the
thing
to
sleep
the
porter
had
pressed
the
matter
home
against
the
browns
and
had
produced
the
interview
which
has
been
recorded
but
during
the
whole
of
that
day
jones
had
been
resolving
that
he
would
never
again
either
think
of
the
browns
or
speak
of
them
a
great
injury
had
been
done
to
him
a
most
outrageous
injustice
but
it
was
a
thing
which
had
to
be
endured
a
horrid
woman
had
come
across
him
like
a
nightmare
all
he
could
do
was
to
endeavour
to
forget
the
terrible
visitation
such
had
been
his
resolve
in
making
which
he
had
passed
that
long
day
in
paris
and
now
the
browns
had
stuck
to
him
from
the
moment
of
his
leaving
his
room
he
had
been
forced
to
travel
with
them
but
had
travelled
with
them
as
a
stranger
he
had
tried
to
comfort
himself
with
the
reflection
that
at
every
fresh
stage
he
would
shake
them
off
in
one
railway
after
another
the
vicinity
had
been
bad
but
still
they
were
strangers
now
he
found
himself
in
the
same
house
with
them
where
of
course
the
story
would
be
told
had
not
the
thing
been
done
on
purpose
that
the
story
might
be
told
there
at
thompson
hall
brown
had
acceded
to
the
proposition
of
the
housekeeper
and
was
about
to
be
taken
to
her
room
when
there
was
heard
a
sound
of
footsteps
along
the
passage
above
and
on
the
stairs
and
a
young
lady
came
bounding
on
to
the
scene
you
have
all
of
you
come
a
quarter
of
an
hour
earlier
than
we
thought
possible
said
the
young
lady
i
did
so
mean
to
be
up
to
receive
you
with
that
she
passed
her
sister
on
the
stairs
for
the
young
lady
was
miss
jane
thompson
sister
to
our
brown
and
hurried
down
into
the
hall
here
brown
who
had
ever
been
on
affectionate
terms
with
his
put
himself
forward
to
receive
her
embraces
but
she
apparently
not
noticing
him
in
her
ardour
rushed
on
and
threw
herself
on
to
the
breast
of
the
other
gentleman
this
is
my
charles
she
said
oh
charles
i
thought
you
never
would
be
charles
burnaby
jones
for
such
was
his
name
since
he
had
inherited
the
jones
property
in
pembrokeshire
received
into
his
arms
the
ardent
girl
of
his
heart
with
all
that
love
and
devotion
to
which
she
was
entitled
but
could
not
do
so
without
some
external
shrinking
from
her
embrace
oh
charles
what
is
it
she
said
nothing
dearest
only
only
then
he
looked
piteously
up
into
brown
s
face
as
though
imploring
her
not
to
tell
the
story
perhaps
jane
you
had
better
introduce
us
said
brown
introduce
you
i
thought
you
had
been
travelling
together
and
staying
at
the
same
hotel
and
all
so
we
have
but
people
may
be
in
the
same
hotel
without
knowing
each
other
and
we
have
travelled
all
the
way
home
with
jones
without
in
the
least
knowing
who
he
how
very
odd
do
you
mean
you
have
never
spoken
not
a
word
said
brown
i
do
so
hope
you
ll
love
each
other
said
jane
it
shan
t
be
my
fault
if
we
don
t
said
brown
i
m
sure
it
shan
t
be
mine
said
brown
tendering
his
hand
to
the
other
gentleman
the
various
feelings
of
the
moment
were
too
much
for
jones
and
he
could
not
respond
quite
as
he
should
have
done
but
as
he
was
taken
upstairs
to
his
room
he
determined
that
he
would
make
the
best
of
it
the
owner
of
the
house
was
old
uncle
john
he
was
a
bachelor
and
with
him
lived
various
members
of
the
family
there
was
the
great
thompson
of
them
all
cousin
robert
who
was
now
member
of
parliament
for
the
essex
flats
and
young
john
as
a
certain
enterprising
thompson
of
the
age
of
forty
was
usually
called
and
then
there
was
old
aunt
bess
and
among
other
young
branches
there
was
miss
jane
thompson
who
was
now
engaged
to
marry
charles
burnaby
jones
as
it
happened
no
other
member
of
the
family
had
as
yet
seen
burnaby
jones
and
he
being
by
nature
of
a
retiring
disposition
felt
himself
to
be
ill
at
ease
when
he
came
into
the
breakfast
parlour
among
all
the
thompsons
he
was
known
to
be
a
gentleman
of
good
family
and
ample
means
and
all
the
thompsons
had
approved
of
the
match
but
during
the
first
christmas
breakfast
he
did
not
seem
to
accept
his
condition
jovially
his
own
jane
sat
beside
him
but
then
on
the
other
side
sat
brown
she
assumed
an
immediate
intimacy
as
women
know
how
to
do
on
such
occasions
being
determined
from
the
very
first
to
regard
her
sister
s
husband
as
a
brother
but
he
still
feared
her
she
was
still
to
him
the
woman
who
had
come
to
him
in
the
dead
of
night
with
that
horrid
mixture
and
had
then
left
him
it
was
so
odd
that
both
of
you
should
have
been
detained
on
the
very
same
day
said
jane
yes
it
was
odd
said
brown
with
a
smile
looking
round
upon
her
neighbour
it
was
abominably
bad
weather
you
know
said
brown
but
you
were
both
so
determined
to
come
said
the
old
gentleman
when
we
got
the
two
telegrams
at
the
same
moment
we
were
sure
that
there
had
been
some
agreement
between
not
exactly
an
agreement
said
brown
whereupon
jones
looked
as
grim
as
death
i
m
sure
there
is
something
more
than
we
understand
yet
said
the
member
of
parliament
then
they
all
went
to
church
as
a
united
family
ought
to
do
on
christmas
day
and
came
home
to
a
fine
old
english
early
dinner
at
three
o
clock
a
sirloin
of
beef
a
broad
a
turkey
as
big
as
an
ostrich
a
bigger
than
the
turkey
and
two
or
three
dozen
that
s
a
very
large
bit
of
beef
said
jones
who
had
not
lived
much
in
england
latterly
it
won
t
look
so
large
said
the
old
gentleman
when
all
our
friends
downstairs
have
had
their
say
to
a
on
christmas
day
can
t
be
too
big
he
said
again
if
the
cook
will
but
take
time
enough
over
it
i
never
knew
a
bit
go
to
waste
by
this
time
there
had
been
some
explanation
as
to
past
events
between
the
two
sisters
brown
had
indeed
told
jane
all
about
it
how
ill
her
husband
had
been
how
she
had
been
forced
to
go
down
and
look
for
the
mustard
and
then
what
she
had
done
with
the
mustard
i
don
t
think
they
are
a
bit
alike
you
know
mary
if
you
mean
that
said
jane
well
no
perhaps
not
quite
alike
i
only
saw
his
beard
you
know
no
doubt
it
was
stupid
but
i
did
why
didn
t
you
take
it
off
again
asked
the
sister
oh
jane
if
you
d
only
think
of
it
could
you
then
of
course
all
that
occurred
was
explained
how
they
had
been
stopped
on
their
journey
how
brown
had
made
the
best
apology
in
his
power
and
how
jones
had
travelled
with
them
and
had
never
spoken
a
word
the
gentleman
had
only
taken
his
new
name
a
week
since
but
of
course
had
had
his
new
card
printed
immediately
i
m
sure
i
should
have
thought
of
it
if
they
hadn
t
made
a
mistake
with
the
first
name
charles
said
it
was
like
barnaby
not
at
all
like
barnaby
rudge
said
jane
charles
burnaby
jones
is
a
very
good
very
good
indeed
and
i
m
sure
that
after
a
little
bit
he
won
t
be
at
all
the
worse
for
the
before
dinner
the
secret
had
been
told
no
further
but
still
there
had
crept
about
among
the
thompsons
and
indeed
downstairs
also
among
the
retainers
a
feeling
that
there
was
a
secret
the
old
housekeeper
was
sure
that
miss
mary
as
she
still
called
brown
had
something
to
tell
if
she
could
only
be
induced
to
tell
it
and
that
this
something
had
reference
to
jones
personal
comfort
the
head
of
the
family
who
was
a
sharp
old
gentleman
felt
this
also
and
the
member
of
parliament
who
had
an
idea
that
he
specially
should
never
be
kept
in
the
dark
was
almost
angry
jones
suffering
from
some
kindred
feeling
throughout
the
dinner
remained
silent
and
unhappy
when
two
or
three
toasts
had
been
drunk
the
queen
s
health
the
old
gentleman
s
health
the
young
couple
s
health
brown
s
health
and
the
general
health
of
all
the
thompsons
then
tongues
were
loosened
and
a
question
was
asked
i
know
that
there
has
been
something
doing
in
paris
between
these
young
people
that
we
haven
t
heard
as
yet
said
the
uncle
then
brown
laughed
and
jane
laughing
too
gave
jones
to
understand
that
she
at
any
rate
knew
all
about
it
if
there
is
a
mystery
i
hope
it
will
be
told
at
once
said
the
member
of
parliament
angrily
come
brown
what
is
it
asked
another
male
cousin
well
there
was
an
accident
i
d
rather
jones
should
tell
said
he
jones
brow
became
blacker
than
thunder
but
he
did
not
say
a
word
you
mustn
t
be
angry
with
mary
jane
whispered
into
her
lover
s
ear
come
mary
you
never
were
slow
at
talking
said
the
uncle
i
do
hate
this
kind
of
thing
said
the
member
of
parliament
i
will
tell
it
all
said
brown
very
nearly
in
tears
or
else
pretending
to
be
very
nearly
in
tears
i
know
i
was
very
wrong
and
i
do
beg
his
pardon
and
if
he
won
t
say
that
he
forgives
me
i
never
shall
be
happy
then
she
clasped
her
hands
and
turning
round
looked
him
piteously
in
the
face
oh
yes
i
do
forgive
you
said
jones
my
brother
said
she
throwing
her
arms
round
him
and
kissing
him
he
recoiled
from
the
embrace
but
i
think
that
he
attempted
to
return
the
kiss
and
now
i
will
tell
the
whole
story
said
brown
and
she
told
it
acknowledging
her
fault
with
true
contrition
and
swearing
that
she
would
atone
for
it
by
sisterly
devotion
and
you
the
wrong
man
said
the
old
gentleman
almost
rolling
off
his
chair
with
delight
i
did
said
brown
sobbing
and
i
think
that
no
woman
ever
suffered
as
i
and
jones
wouldn
t
let
you
leave
the
hotel
it
was
the
handkerchief
stopped
us
said
brown
if
it
had
turned
out
to
be
anybody
else
said
the
member
of
parliament
the
results
might
have
been
most
serious
not
to
say
that
s
nonsense
robert
said
brown
who
was
disposed
to
resent
the
use
of
so
severe
a
word
even
from
the
legislator
cousin
in
a
strange
gentleman
s
bedroom
he
continued
it
only
shows
that
what
i
have
always
said
is
quite
true
you
should
never
go
to
bed
in
a
strange
house
without
locking
your
nevertheless
it
was
a
very
jovial
meeting
and
before
the
evening
was
over
jones
was
happy
and
had
been
brought
to
acknowledge
that
the
would
probably
not
do
him
any
permanent
injury
the
telegraph
girl
chapter
lucy
graham
and
sophy
wilson
three
shillings
a
day
to
cover
all
expenses
of
life
food
raiment
shelter
a
room
in
which
to
eat
and
sleep
and
fire
and
light
and
recreation
if
recreation
there
might
be
is
not
much
but
when
lucy
graham
the
heroine
of
this
tale
found
herself
alone
in
the
world
she
was
glad
to
think
that
she
was
able
to
earn
so
much
by
her
work
and
that
thus
she
possessed
the
means
of
independence
if
she
chose
to
be
independent
her
story
up
to
the
date
with
which
we
are
dealing
shall
be
very
shortly
told
she
had
lived
for
many
years
with
a
married
brother
who
was
a
bookseller
in
holborn
in
a
small
way
of
business
and
burdened
with
a
large
family
but
still
living
in
decent
comfort
in
order
however
that
she
might
earn
her
own
bread
she
had
gone
into
the
service
of
the
crown
as
a
telegraph
girl
in
the
telegraph
office
a
and
there
she
had
remained
till
the
present
time
and
there
she
was
earning
eighteen
shillings
a
week
by
eight
hours
continual
work
daily
her
life
had
been
full
of
occupation
as
in
her
spare
hours
she
had
been
her
brother
s
assistant
in
his
shop
and
had
made
herself
familiar
with
the
details
of
his
trade
but
the
brother
had
suddenly
died
and
it
had
been
quickly
decided
that
the
widow
and
the
children
should
take
themselves
off
to
some
provincial
refuge
then
it
was
that
lucy
graham
had
to
think
of
her
independence
and
her
eighteen
shillings
a
week
on
the
one
side
and
of
her
desolation
and
feminine
necessities
on
the
other
to
run
backwards
and
forwards
from
high
holborn
to
martin
had
been
very
well
as
long
as
she
could
comfort
herself
with
the
companionship
of
her
and
defend
herself
with
her
brother
s
arm
but
how
would
it
be
with
her
if
she
were
called
upon
to
live
all
alone
in
london
she
was
driven
to
consider
what
else
she
could
do
to
earn
her
bread
she
might
become
a
nursemaid
or
perhaps
a
nursery
governess
though
she
had
been
well
and
in
some
respects
carefully
educated
she
knew
that
she
could
not
soar
above
that
of
music
she
did
not
know
a
note
she
could
draw
a
little
and
understood
enough
french
not
to
read
it
but
to
teach
herself
to
read
it
with
english
literature
she
was
better
acquainted
than
is
usual
with
young
women
of
her
age
and
class
and
as
her
only
personal
treasures
she
had
managed
to
save
a
few
books
which
had
become
hers
through
her
brother
s
kindness
to
be
a
servant
was
distasteful
to
her
not
through
any
idea
that
service
was
disreputable
but
from
a
dislike
to
be
subject
at
all
hours
to
the
will
of
others
to
work
and
work
hard
she
was
quite
willing
so
that
there
might
be
some
hours
of
her
life
in
which
she
might
not
be
called
upon
to
obey
when
therefore
it
was
suggested
to
her
that
she
had
better
abandon
the
telegraph
office
and
seek
the
security
of
some
household
her
spirit
rebelled
against
the
counsel
why
should
she
not
be
independent
and
respectable
and
safe
but
then
the
solitude
solitude
would
certainly
be
hard
but
absolute
solitude
might
not
perhaps
be
necessary
she
was
fond
too
of
the
idea
of
being
a
government
servant
with
a
sure
and
fixed
salary
bound
of
course
to
her
work
at
certain
hours
but
so
bound
only
for
certain
hours
during
a
third
of
the
day
she
was
as
she
proudly
told
herself
a
servant
of
the
crown
during
the
other
she
was
lord
or
lady
of
herself
but
there
was
a
quaintness
a
mystery
even
an
awe
about
her
independence
which
almost
terrified
her
during
her
labours
she
had
eight
hundred
female
companions
all
congregated
together
in
one
vast
room
but
as
soon
as
she
left
the
post
office
she
was
to
be
all
alone
for
a
few
months
after
her
brother
s
death
she
continued
to
live
with
her
during
which
time
this
great
question
was
being
discussed
but
then
the
and
the
children
disappeared
and
it
was
incumbent
on
lucy
to
fix
herself
somewhere
she
must
begin
life
after
what
seemed
to
her
to
be
a
most
unfeminine
fashion
just
as
though
she
were
a
young
man
for
it
was
thus
that
she
described
to
herself
her
own
position
over
and
over
again
at
this
time
lucy
graham
was
years
old
she
had
hitherto
regarded
herself
as
being
stronger
and
more
steadfast
than
are
women
generally
of
that
age
she
had
taught
herself
to
despise
feminine
weaknesses
and
had
learned
to
be
almost
her
brother
s
equal
in
managing
the
affairs
of
his
shop
in
his
absence
she
had
declared
to
herself
looking
forward
then
to
some
future
necessity
which
had
become
present
to
her
with
terrible
quickness
that
she
would
not
be
feckless
helpless
and
insufficient
for
herself
as
are
so
many
females
she
had
girded
herself
up
for
a
life
looking
forward
to
a
time
when
she
might
leave
the
telegraphs
and
become
a
partner
with
her
brother
a
sudden
disruption
had
broken
up
all
that
she
was
well
made
cheery
healthy
and
to
some
eyes
singularly
though
no
one
probably
would
have
called
her
either
pretty
or
handsome
in
the
first
place
her
complexion
was
brown
it
was
impossible
to
deny
that
her
whole
face
was
brown
as
also
was
her
hair
and
generally
her
dress
there
was
a
pervading
brownness
about
her
which
left
upon
those
who
met
her
a
lasting
connection
between
lucy
graham
and
that
serviceable
colour
but
there
was
nobody
so
convinced
that
she
was
brown
from
head
to
foot
as
was
she
herself
a
good
lasting
colour
she
would
call
it
one
that
did
not
require
to
be
washed
every
in
order
that
it
might
be
decent
but
could
bear
real
washing
when
it
was
wanted
for
it
was
a
point
of
her
inner
creed
of
her
very
faith
of
faith
that
she
was
not
to
depend
upon
feminine
good
looks
or
any
of
the
adventitious
charms
of
dress
for
her
advance
in
the
world
a
good
strong
binding
she
would
say
of
certain
books
that
will
stand
the
gas
and
not
look
disfigured
even
though
a
blot
of
ink
should
come
in
its
and
so
it
was
that
she
regarded
her
own
personal
binding
but
for
all
that
she
was
to
some
observers
very
attractive
there
was
not
a
mean
feature
in
her
face
her
forehead
was
spacious
and
well
formed
her
eyes
which
were
brown
also
were
very
bright
and
could
sparkle
with
anger
or
solicitude
or
perhaps
with
love
her
nose
was
well
formed
and
delicately
shaped
enough
her
mouth
was
large
but
full
of
expression
and
seemed
to
declare
without
speech
that
she
could
be
eloquent
the
form
of
her
face
was
oval
and
complete
not
as
though
it
had
been
moulded
by
an
inartistic
thumb
a
bit
added
on
here
and
a
bit
there
she
was
somewhat
above
the
average
height
of
women
and
stood
upon
her
legs
or
walked
upon
them
as
though
she
understood
that
they
had
been
given
to
her
for
real
use
two
years
before
her
brother
s
death
there
had
been
a
suitor
for
her
hand
as
to
whose
suit
she
had
in
truth
doubted
much
he
also
had
been
a
bookseller
a
man
in
a
larger
way
of
business
than
her
brother
some
fifteen
years
older
than
herself
a
widower
with
a
family
she
knew
him
to
be
a
good
man
with
a
comfortable
house
an
adequate
income
and
a
kind
heart
had
she
gone
to
him
she
would
not
have
been
required
then
to
live
among
the
bookshelves
or
the
telegraphs
she
had
doubted
much
whether
she
would
not
go
to
him
she
knew
she
could
love
the
children
she
thought
that
she
could
buckle
herself
to
that
new
work
with
a
will
but
she
feared
she
feared
that
she
could
not
love
him
perhaps
there
had
come
across
her
heart
some
idea
of
what
might
be
the
joy
of
real
downright
hearty
love
if
so
it
was
only
an
idea
no
personage
had
come
across
her
path
thus
to
disturb
her
but
the
idea
or
the
fear
had
been
so
strong
with
her
that
she
had
never
been
able
to
induce
herself
to
become
the
wife
of
this
man
and
when
he
had
come
to
her
after
her
brother
s
death
in
her
worst
desolation
when
the
prospect
of
service
in
some
other
nursery
had
been
strongest
before
her
eyes
she
had
still
refused
him
perhaps
there
had
been
a
pride
in
this
a
feeling
that
as
she
had
rejected
him
in
her
comparative
prosperity
she
should
not
take
him
now
when
the
renewal
of
his
offer
might
probably
be
the
effect
of
generosity
but
she
did
refuse
him
and
the
widowed
bookseller
had
to
look
elsewhere
for
a
second
mother
for
his
children
then
there
arose
the
question
how
and
where
she
should
live
when
it
came
to
the
point
of
settling
herself
that
idea
of
starting
in
life
like
a
young
man
became
very
awful
indeed
how
was
she
to
do
it
would
any
respectable
keeper
of
lodgings
take
her
in
upon
that
principle
and
if
so
in
what
way
should
she
plan
out
her
life
sixteen
hours
a
day
were
to
be
her
own
what
should
she
do
with
them
was
she
or
was
she
not
to
contemplate
the
enjoyment
of
any
social
pleasures
and
if
so
how
were
they
to
be
found
of
such
a
nature
as
not
to
be
discreditable
on
rare
occasions
she
had
gone
to
the
play
with
her
brother
and
had
then
enjoyed
the
treat
thoroughly
whether
it
had
been
at
the
lyceum
or
at
the
haymarket
she
had
found
herself
equally
able
to
be
happy
but
there
could
not
be
for
her
now
even
such
rare
occasions
as
these
she
thought
that
she
knew
that
a
young
woman
all
alone
could
not
go
to
the
theatre
with
propriety
let
her
be
ever
so
brave
and
then
those
three
shillings
a
day
though
sufficient
for
life
would
hardly
be
more
than
sufficient
but
how
should
she
begin
at
last
chance
assisted
her
another
girl
also
employed
in
the
telegraph
office
with
whom
there
had
been
some
family
acquaintance
over
and
beyond
that
formed
in
the
office
happened
at
this
time
to
be
thrown
upon
the
world
in
some
such
fashion
as
herself
and
the
two
agreed
to
join
their
forces
she
was
one
sophy
wilson
by
name
and
it
was
agreed
between
them
that
they
should
club
their
means
together
and
hire
a
room
for
their
joint
use
here
would
be
a
companionship
and
possibly
after
awhile
sweet
friendship
sophy
was
younger
than
herself
and
might
probably
need
perhaps
be
willing
to
accept
assistance
to
be
able
to
do
something
that
should
be
of
use
to
somebody
would
she
felt
go
far
towards
giving
her
life
that
interest
which
it
would
otherwise
lack
when
lucy
examined
her
friend
thinking
of
the
closeness
of
their
future
connection
she
was
startled
by
the
girl
s
prettiness
and
youth
and
thorough
unlikeness
to
herself
sophy
had
long
black
glossy
curls
large
eyes
a
pink
complexion
and
was
very
short
she
seemed
to
have
no
inclination
for
that
strong
serviceable
brown
binding
which
was
so
valuable
in
lucy
s
eyes
but
rather
to
be
wedded
to
bright
colours
and
soft
materials
and
it
soon
became
evident
to
the
elder
young
woman
that
the
younger
looked
upon
her
employment
simply
as
a
to
a
husband
to
get
herself
married
as
soon
as
possible
was
unblushingly
declared
by
sophy
wilson
to
be
the
one
object
of
her
ambition
and
as
she
supposed
that
of
every
other
girl
in
the
telegraph
department
but
she
seemed
to
be
friendly
and
at
first
docile
to
have
been
brought
up
with
aptitudes
for
decent
life
and
to
be
imbued
with
the
necessity
of
not
spending
more
than
her
three
shillings
a
day
and
she
was
quick
enough
at
her
work
in
the
office
quicker
even
than
lucy
herself
which
was
taken
by
lucy
as
evidence
that
her
new
friend
was
clever
and
would
therefore
probably
be
an
agreeable
companion
they
took
together
a
bedroom
in
a
very
quiet
street
in
clerkenwell
a
street
which
might
be
described
as
genteel
because
it
contained
no
shops
and
here
they
began
to
keep
house
as
they
called
it
now
the
nature
of
their
work
was
such
that
they
were
not
called
upon
to
be
in
their
office
till
noon
but
that
then
they
were
required
to
remain
there
till
eight
in
the
evening
at
two
a
short
space
was
allowed
them
for
dinner
which
was
furnished
to
them
at
a
cheap
rate
in
a
room
adjacent
to
that
in
which
they
worked
here
for
eightpence
each
they
could
get
a
good
meal
or
if
they
preferred
it
they
could
bring
their
food
with
them
and
even
have
it
cooked
upon
the
premises
in
the
evening
tea
and
bread
and
butter
were
provided
for
them
by
the
officials
and
then
at
eight
or
a
few
minutes
after
they
left
the
building
and
walked
home
the
keeping
of
house
was
restricted
in
fact
to
providing
tea
and
bread
and
butter
for
the
morning
meal
and
perhaps
when
they
could
afford
it
for
the
repetition
of
such
comfort
later
in
the
evening
there
was
the
sunday
to
be
considered
as
to
which
day
they
made
a
contract
with
the
keeper
of
the
to
sit
at
her
table
and
partake
of
her
dishes
and
so
they
were
established
from
the
first
lucy
graham
made
up
her
mind
that
it
was
her
duty
to
be
a
very
friend
of
friends
to
this
new
companion
it
was
as
though
she
had
consented
to
marry
that
widowed
bookseller
she
would
then
have
considered
herself
bound
to
devote
herself
to
his
welfare
it
was
not
that
she
could
as
yet
say
that
she
loved
sophy
wilson
love
with
her
could
not
be
so
immediate
as
that
but
the
nature
of
the
bond
between
them
was
such
that
each
might
possibly
do
so
much
either
for
the
happiness
or
the
unhappiness
of
the
other
and
then
though
sophy
was
clever
for
as
to
this
lucy
did
not
doubt
still
she
was
too
evidently
in
many
things
inferior
to
herself
and
much
in
want
of
such
assistance
as
a
stronger
nature
could
give
her
lucy
in
acknowledging
this
put
down
her
own
greater
strength
to
the
score
of
her
years
and
the
nature
of
the
life
which
she
had
been
called
upon
to
lead
she
had
early
in
her
days
been
required
to
help
herself
to
hold
her
own
and
to
be
as
it
were
a
woman
of
business
but
the
weakness
of
the
other
was
very
apparent
to
her
that
doctrine
as
to
the
necessity
of
a
husband
which
had
been
very
soon
declared
had
well
almost
disgusted
lucy
and
then
she
found
cause
to
lament
the
peculiar
arrangement
which
the
requirements
of
the
office
had
made
as
to
their
hours
at
first
it
had
seemed
to
her
to
be
very
pleasant
that
they
should
have
their
morning
hours
for
needlework
and
perhaps
for
a
little
reading
but
when
she
found
that
sophy
would
lie
in
bed
till
ten
because
early
rising
was
not
obligatory
then
she
wished
that
they
had
been
classed
among
those
whose
presence
was
demanded
at
eight
after
awhile
there
was
a
little
difference
between
them
as
to
what
might
or
what
might
not
be
done
with
propriety
after
their
office
hours
were
over
it
must
be
explained
that
in
that
huge
room
in
which
eight
hundred
girls
were
at
work
together
there
was
also
a
sprinkling
of
boys
and
young
men
as
no
girls
were
employed
there
after
eight
there
would
always
be
on
duty
in
the
afternoon
an
increasing
number
of
the
other
sex
some
of
whom
remained
there
till
late
at
night
some
indeed
all
night
now
whether
by
chance
or
as
lucy
feared
by
management
sophy
wilson
had
her
usual
seat
next
to
a
young
lad
with
whom
she
soon
contracted
a
certain
amount
of
intimacy
and
from
this
intimacy
arose
a
proposition
that
they
two
should
go
with
murray
he
was
at
first
called
mister
but
the
formal
appellation
soon
degenerated
into
a
familiar
alec
to
a
music
hall
lucy
graham
at
once
set
her
face
against
the
music
hall
but
why
asked
the
other
girl
you
don
t
mean
to
say
that
decent
people
don
t
go
to
music
halls
i
don
t
mean
to
say
anything
of
the
kind
but
then
they
go
decently
how
decently
we
should
be
with
their
brothers
said
lucy
or
something
of
that
brothers
ejaculated
the
other
girl
with
a
tone
of
thorough
contempt
a
visit
to
a
music
hall
with
her
brother
was
not
at
all
the
sort
of
pleasure
to
which
sophy
was
looking
forward
she
did
her
best
to
get
over
objections
which
to
her
seemed
to
be
fastidious
and
absurd
observing
that
if
people
were
to
feel
like
that
there
would
be
no
coming
together
of
people
at
but
when
she
found
that
lucy
could
not
be
instigated
to
go
to
the
music
hall
and
that
the
idea
of
alec
murray
and
herself
going
to
such
a
place
unattended
by
others
was
regarded
as
a
proposition
too
monstrous
to
be
discussed
sophy
for
awhile
gave
way
but
she
returned
again
and
again
to
the
subject
thinking
to
prevail
by
asserting
that
alec
had
a
friend
a
most
excellent
young
man
who
would
go
with
them
and
bring
his
sister
alec
was
almost
sure
that
the
sister
would
come
lucy
however
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
lucy
thought
that
there
should
be
very
great
intimacy
indeed
before
anything
of
that
kind
should
be
permitted
and
so
there
was
something
of
a
quarrel
sophy
declared
that
such
a
life
as
theirs
was
too
hard
for
her
and
that
some
kind
of
amusement
was
necessary
unless
she
were
allowed
some
delight
she
must
go
mad
she
must
die
she
must
throw
herself
off
waterloo
bridge
lucy
remembering
her
duty
remembering
how
imperative
it
was
that
she
should
endeavour
to
do
good
to
the
one
human
being
with
whom
she
was
closely
concerned
forgave
her
and
tried
to
comfort
her
forgave
her
even
though
at
last
she
refused
to
be
guided
by
her
monitress
for
sophy
did
go
to
the
music
hall
with
alec
murray
reporting
but
reporting
falsely
that
they
were
accompanied
by
the
friend
and
the
friend
s
sister
lucy
poor
lucy
was
constrained
by
certain
circumstances
to
disbelieve
this
false
assertion
she
feared
that
sophy
had
gone
with
alec
alone
as
was
the
fact
but
yet
she
forgave
her
friend
how
are
we
to
live
together
at
all
if
we
can
not
forgive
each
other
s
offences
chapter
ii
abraham
hall
as
there
was
no
immediate
repetition
of
the
offence
the
forgiveness
soon
became
complete
and
lucy
found
the
interest
of
her
life
in
her
endeavours
to
be
good
to
this
weak
child
whom
chance
had
thrown
in
her
way
for
sophy
wilson
was
but
a
weak
child
she
was
full
of
alec
murray
for
awhile
and
induced
lucy
to
make
the
young
man
s
acquaintance
the
lad
was
earning
twelve
shillings
a
week
and
if
these
two
poor
young
creatures
chose
to
love
each
other
and
get
themselves
married
it
would
be
respectable
though
it
might
be
unfortunate
it
would
at
any
rate
be
the
way
of
the
world
and
was
a
natural
combination
with
which
she
would
have
no
right
to
interfere
but
she
found
that
alec
was
a
mere
boy
and
with
no
idea
beyond
the
enjoyment
of
a
bright
scarf
and
a
penny
cigar
with
a
girl
by
his
side
at
a
music
hall
i
don
t
think
it
can
be
worth
your
while
to
go
much
out
of
your
way
for
his
sake
said
lucy
who
is
going
out
of
her
way
not
he
s
as
good
as
anybody
else
i
suppose
and
one
must
have
somebody
to
talk
to
these
last
words
she
uttered
so
plaintively
showing
so
plainly
that
she
was
unable
to
endure
the
simple
unchanging
dulness
of
a
life
of
labour
that
lucy
s
heart
was
thoroughly
softened
towards
her
she
had
the
great
gift
of
being
not
the
less
able
to
sympathize
with
the
weakness
of
the
weak
because
of
her
own
abnormal
strength
and
so
it
came
to
pass
that
she
worked
for
her
friend
stitching
and
mending
when
the
girl
ought
to
have
stitched
and
mended
for
herself
reading
to
her
even
though
but
little
of
what
was
read
might
be
understood
yielding
to
her
and
assisting
her
in
all
things
till
at
last
it
came
to
pass
that
in
truth
she
loved
her
and
such
love
and
care
were
much
wanted
for
the
elder
girl
soon
found
that
the
younger
was
weak
in
health
as
well
as
weak
in
spirit
there
were
days
on
which
she
could
not
or
at
any
rate
did
not
go
to
her
office
when
six
months
had
passed
by
lucy
had
not
once
been
absent
since
she
had
begun
her
new
life
have
you
seen
that
man
who
has
come
to
look
at
our
house
asked
sophy
one
day
as
they
were
walking
down
to
the
office
lucy
had
seen
a
strange
man
having
met
him
on
the
stairs
isn
t
he
a
fine
fellow
for
anything
that
i
know
let
us
hope
that
he
is
very
fine
said
lucy
laughing
he
s
about
as
handsome
a
chap
as
i
think
i
ever
as
for
being
a
chap
the
man
i
saw
must
be
near
he
is
a
little
old
i
should
say
but
not
near
that
i
don
t
think
he
can
have
a
wife
or
he
wouldn
t
come
here
he
s
an
engineer
and
he
has
the
care
of
a
in
the
city
road
that
great
printing
place
his
name
is
abraham
hall
and
he
s
earning
three
or
four
pounds
a
week
a
man
like
that
ought
to
have
a
how
did
you
learn
all
about
him
it
s
all
true
sally
heard
it
from
green
was
the
keeper
of
the
and
sally
was
the
maid
i
couldn
t
help
speaking
to
him
yesterday
because
we
were
both
at
the
door
together
he
talked
just
like
a
gentleman
although
he
was
all
smutty
and
i
am
glad
he
talked
like
a
i
told
him
we
lodged
here
and
that
we
were
telegraph
girls
and
that
we
never
got
home
till
eight
he
would
be
just
the
beau
for
you
because
he
is
such
a
big
i
don
t
want
a
beau
said
lucy
angrily
then
i
shall
take
him
myself
said
sophy
as
she
entered
the
office
soon
after
that
it
came
to
pass
that
there
did
arise
a
slight
acquaintance
between
both
the
girls
and
abraham
hall
partly
from
the
fact
of
their
near
neighbourhood
partly
perhaps
from
some
little
tricks
on
sophy
s
part
but
the
man
seemed
to
be
so
steady
so
solid
so
little
given
to
lightnesses
of
flirtation
or
to
dangerous
delights
that
lucy
was
inclined
to
welcome
the
accident
when
she
saw
him
on
a
sunday
morning
free
from
the
soil
of
his
work
she
could
perceive
that
he
was
still
a
young
man
probably
not
much
over
thirty
but
there
was
a
look
about
him
as
though
he
were
well
inured
to
the
cares
of
the
world
such
as
is
often
produced
by
the
possession
of
a
wife
and
family
not
a
look
of
depression
by
any
means
but
seeming
to
betoken
an
appreciation
of
the
seriousness
of
life
from
all
this
lucy
unconsciously
accepted
an
idea
of
security
in
the
man
feeling
that
it
might
be
pleasant
to
have
some
strong
one
near
her
from
whom
in
case
of
need
assistance
might
be
asked
without
fear
for
this
man
was
tall
and
broad
and
powerful
and
seemed
to
lucy
s
eyes
to
be
a
very
pillar
of
strength
when
he
would
stand
still
for
a
moment
to
greet
her
in
the
streets
but
poor
sophy
who
had
so
graciously
offered
the
man
to
her
friend
at
the
beginning
of
their
intercourse
seemed
soon
to
change
her
mind
and
to
desire
his
attention
for
herself
he
was
certainly
much
more
worthy
than
alec
murray
but
to
lucy
to
whom
it
was
a
rule
of
life
as
strong
as
any
in
the
commandments
that
a
girl
should
not
throw
herself
at
a
man
but
should
be
sought
by
him
it
was
a
painful
thing
to
see
how
many
of
poor
sophy
s
sixpences
were
now
spent
in
little
articles
of
finery
by
which
it
was
hoped
that
hall
s
eyes
might
be
gratified
and
how
those
glossy
ringlets
were
brushed
and
made
to
shine
with
pomatum
and
how
the
little
collars
were
washed
and
and
starched
and
in
order
that
she
might
be
smart
for
him
lucy
who
was
always
neat
endeavoured
to
become
browner
and
browner
this
she
did
by
way
of
reproach
and
condemnation
not
at
all
surmising
that
hall
might
possibly
prefer
a
good
solid
wearing
colour
to
glittering
blue
and
pink
gewgaws
at
this
time
sophy
was
always
full
of
what
hall
had
last
said
to
her
and
after
awhile
broached
an
idea
that
he
was
some
gentleman
in
disguise
why
in
disguise
why
not
a
gentleman
not
in
disguise
asked
lucy
who
had
her
own
ideas
perhaps
a
little
exaggerated
as
to
nature
s
gentlemen
then
sophy
explained
herself
a
gentleman
a
real
gentleman
in
disguise
would
be
very
interesting
one
who
had
quarrelled
with
his
father
perhaps
because
he
would
not
endure
paternal
tyranny
and
had
then
determined
to
earn
his
own
bread
till
he
might
happily
come
into
the
family
honours
and
property
in
a
year
or
two
perhaps
instead
of
being
abraham
hall
he
was
in
reality
the
right
honourable
russell
howard
cavendish
and
if
during
his
temporary
abeyance
he
should
prove
his
thorough
emancipation
from
the
thraldom
of
his
aristocracy
by
falling
in
love
with
a
telegraph
girl
how
fine
it
would
be
when
lucy
expressed
an
opinion
that
hall
might
be
a
very
fine
fellow
though
he
were
fulfilling
no
more
than
the
normal
condition
of
his
life
at
the
present
moment
sophy
would
not
be
contented
declaring
that
her
friend
with
all
her
reading
knew
nothing
of
poetry
in
this
way
they
talked
very
frequently
about
abraham
hall
till
lucy
would
often
feel
that
such
talking
was
indecorous
then
she
would
be
silent
for
awhile
herself
and
rebuke
the
other
girl
for
her
constant
mention
of
the
man
s
name
then
again
she
would
be
brought
back
to
the
subject
for
in
all
the
little
intercourse
which
took
place
between
them
and
the
man
his
conduct
was
so
simple
and
yet
so
civil
that
she
could
not
really
feel
him
to
be
unworthy
of
a
place
in
her
thoughts
but
sophy
soon
declared
frankly
to
her
friend
that
she
was
absolutely
in
love
with
the
man
you
wouldn
t
have
him
you
know
she
said
when
lucy
scolded
her
for
the
avowal
have
him
how
can
you
bring
yourself
to
talk
in
such
a
way
about
a
man
what
does
he
want
of
either
of
us
men
do
marry
you
know
sometimes
said
sophy
and
i
don
t
know
how
a
young
man
is
to
get
a
wife
unless
some
girl
will
show
that
she
is
fond
of
he
should
show
first
that
he
is
fond
of
that
s
all
very
well
for
said
sophy
but
it
doesn
t
do
for
practice
men
are
awfully
shy
and
then
though
they
do
marry
sometimes
they
don
t
want
to
get
married
particularly
not
as
we
do
it
comes
like
an
accident
but
how
is
a
man
to
fall
into
a
pit
if
there
s
no
pit
open
in
answer
to
this
lucy
used
many
arguments
and
much
scolding
but
to
very
little
effect
that
the
other
girl
should
have
thought
so
much
about
it
and
be
so
ready
with
her
arguments
was
horrid
to
her
a
pit
open
ejaculated
lucy
i
would
rather
never
speak
to
a
man
again
than
regard
myself
in
such
a
sophy
said
that
all
that
might
be
very
well
but
declared
that
it
would
not
the
elder
girl
was
so
much
shocked
by
all
this
that
there
came
upon
her
gradually
a
feeling
of
doubt
whether
their
joint
life
could
be
continued
sophy
declared
her
purpose
openly
of
entrapping
abraham
hall
into
a
marriage
and
had
absolutely
induced
him
to
take
her
to
the
theatre
he
had
asked
lucy
to
join
them
but
she
had
sternly
refused
basing
her
refusal
on
her
inability
to
bear
the
expense
when
he
offered
to
give
her
the
treat
she
told
him
with
simple
gravity
that
nothing
would
induce
her
to
accept
such
a
favour
from
any
man
who
was
not
either
a
very
old
friend
or
a
near
relation
when
she
said
this
he
so
looked
at
her
that
she
was
sure
that
he
approved
of
her
resolve
he
did
not
say
a
word
to
press
her
but
he
took
sophy
wilson
and
as
lucy
knew
paid
for
sophy
s
ticket
all
this
displeased
lucy
so
much
that
she
began
to
think
whether
there
must
not
be
a
separation
she
could
not
continue
to
live
on
terms
of
affectionate
friendship
with
a
girl
whose
conduct
she
so
strongly
disapproved
but
then
again
though
she
could
not
restrain
the
poor
light
thing
altogether
she
did
restrain
her
in
some
degree
she
was
doing
some
good
by
her
companionship
and
then
if
it
really
was
in
the
man
s
mind
to
marry
the
girl
that
certainly
would
be
a
good
thing
for
the
girl
with
such
a
husband
she
would
be
steady
enough
she
was
quite
sure
that
the
idea
of
preparing
a
pit
for
such
a
one
as
abraham
hall
must
be
absurd
but
sophy
was
pretty
and
clever
and
if
married
would
at
any
rate
love
her
husband
lucy
thought
she
had
heard
that
steady
severe
thoughtful
men
were
apt
to
attach
themselves
to
women
of
the
butterfly
order
she
did
not
like
the
way
in
which
sophy
was
doing
this
but
then
who
was
she
that
she
should
be
a
judge
if
abraham
hall
liked
it
would
not
that
be
much
more
to
the
purpose
therefore
she
resolved
that
there
should
be
no
separation
at
present
and
if
possible
no
quarrelling
but
soon
it
came
to
pass
that
there
was
another
very
solid
reason
against
separation
sophy
who
was
often
unwell
and
would
sometimes
stay
away
from
the
office
for
a
day
or
two
on
the
score
of
though
by
doing
so
she
lost
one
of
her
three
shillings
on
each
such
day
gradually
became
worse
the
superintendent
at
her
department
had
declared
that
in
case
of
further
absence
a
medical
certificate
must
be
sent
and
the
doctor
attached
to
the
office
had
called
upon
her
he
had
looked
grave
had
declared
that
she
wanted
considerable
care
had
then
gone
so
far
as
to
recommend
rest
which
meant
absence
from
work
for
at
least
a
fortnight
and
ordered
her
medicine
this
of
course
meant
the
loss
of
a
third
of
her
wages
in
such
circumstances
and
at
such
a
time
it
was
not
likely
that
lucy
should
think
of
separation
while
sophy
was
ill
abraham
hall
often
came
to
the
door
to
inquire
after
her
health
so
often
that
lucy
almost
thought
that
her
friend
had
succeeded
the
man
seemed
to
be
sympathetic
and
anxious
and
would
hardly
have
inquired
with
so
much
solicitude
had
he
not
really
been
anxious
as
to
poor
sophy
s
health
then
when
sophy
was
better
he
would
come
in
to
see
her
and
the
girl
would
deck
herself
out
with
some
little
ribbon
and
would
have
her
collar
always
starched
and
ironed
ready
for
his
reception
it
certainly
did
seem
to
lucy
that
the
man
was
becoming
fond
of
her
foolish
little
friend
during
this
period
lucy
of
course
had
to
go
to
the
office
alone
leaving
sophy
to
the
care
of
the
keeper
and
in
her
solitude
troubles
were
heavy
on
her
in
the
first
place
sophy
s
illness
had
created
certain
necessarily
increased
expenses
and
at
the
same
time
their
joint
incomes
had
been
diminished
by
one
shilling
a
week
out
of
six
lucy
was
in
general
matters
allowed
to
be
the
dispenser
of
the
money
but
on
occasions
the
other
girl
would
assert
her
rights
which
always
meant
her
right
to
some
indulgence
out
of
their
joint
incomes
which
would
be
an
indulgence
to
her
and
her
alone
even
those
bright
ribbons
could
not
be
had
for
nothing
lucy
wanted
no
bright
ribbons
when
they
were
fairly
prosperous
she
had
not
grudged
some
little
expenditure
in
this
direction
she
had
told
herself
that
young
girls
like
to
be
bright
in
the
eyes
of
men
and
that
she
had
no
right
even
to
endeavour
to
make
her
friend
look
at
all
these
things
with
her
eyes
she
even
confessed
to
herself
some
deficiency
on
her
own
part
some
want
of
womanliness
in
that
she
did
not
aspire
to
be
attractive
still
owning
to
herself
vehemently
declaring
to
herself
that
to
be
attractive
in
the
eyes
of
a
man
whom
she
could
love
would
of
all
delights
be
the
most
delightful
thinking
of
all
this
she
had
endeavoured
not
to
be
angry
with
poor
sophy
but
when
she
became
pinched
for
shillings
and
sixpences
and
to
feel
doubtful
whether
at
the
end
of
each
fortnight
there
would
be
money
to
pay
green
for
lodgings
and
coal
then
her
heart
became
sad
within
her
and
she
told
herself
that
sophy
though
she
was
ill
ought
to
be
more
careful
and
there
was
another
trouble
which
for
awhile
was
very
grievous
telegraphy
is
an
art
not
yet
perfected
among
us
and
is
still
subject
to
many
changes
now
it
was
the
case
at
this
time
that
the
pundits
of
the
office
were
in
favour
of
a
system
of
communicating
messages
by
ear
instead
of
by
eye
the
little
dots
and
pricks
which
even
in
lucy
s
time
had
been
changed
more
than
once
had
quickly
become
familiar
to
her
no
one
could
read
and
use
her
telegraphic
literature
more
rapidly
or
correctly
than
lucy
graham
but
now
that
this
system
of
little
tinkling
sounds
was
coming
up
a
system
which
seemed
to
be
very
pleasant
to
those
females
who
were
gifted
with
musical
aptitudes
she
found
herself
to
be
less
quick
less
expert
less
useful
than
her
neighbours
this
was
very
sad
for
she
had
always
been
buoyed
up
by
an
unconscious
conviction
of
her
own
superior
intelligence
and
then
though
there
had
been
neither
promises
nor
threats
she
had
become
aware
at
any
rate
had
thought
that
she
was
aware
that
those
girls
who
could
catch
and
use
the
tinkling
sounds
would
rise
more
quickly
to
higher
pay
than
the
less
gifted
ones
she
had
struggled
therefore
to
overcome
the
difficulty
she
had
endeavoured
to
force
her
ears
to
do
that
which
her
ears
were
not
capable
of
accomplishing
she
had
failed
and
had
owned
to
herself
that
she
must
fail
but
sophy
had
been
one
of
the
first
to
catch
the
tinkling
sounds
lucy
came
back
to
her
room
sad
and
down
at
heart
and
full
of
troubles
she
had
a
long
task
of
needlework
before
her
which
had
been
put
by
for
awhile
through
causes
consequent
on
sophy
s
illness
now
she
is
better
perhaps
he
will
marry
her
and
take
her
away
and
i
shall
be
alone
again
she
said
to
herself
as
though
declaring
that
such
a
state
of
things
would
be
a
relief
to
her
and
almost
a
happiness
he
has
just
been
here
said
sophy
to
her
as
soon
as
she
entered
the
room
sophy
was
painfully
cruelly
smart
clean
and
starched
and
shining
about
her
locks
so
prepared
that
as
lucy
thought
she
must
have
evidently
expected
him
well
and
what
did
he
say
he
has
not
said
much
yet
but
it
was
very
good
of
him
to
come
and
see
me
and
he
was
looking
so
handsome
he
is
going
out
somewhere
this
evening
to
some
political
meeting
with
two
or
three
other
men
and
he
was
got
up
quite
like
a
gentleman
i
do
like
to
see
him
look
like
i
always
think
a
working
man
looks
best
in
his
working
clothes
said
lucy
there
s
some
truth
about
him
then
when
he
gets
into
a
black
coat
he
is
pretending
to
be
something
else
but
everybody
can
see
the
there
was
a
severity
almost
a
savageness
in
this
which
surprised
sophy
so
much
that
at
first
she
hardly
knew
how
to
answer
it
he
is
going
to
speak
at
the
meeting
she
said
after
a
pause
and
of
course
he
had
to
make
himself
tidy
he
told
me
all
that
he
is
going
to
say
should
you
not
like
to
hear
him
speak
no
said
lucy
very
sharply
setting
to
work
instantly
upon
her
labours
not
giving
herself
a
moment
for
preparation
or
a
moment
for
rest
why
should
she
like
to
hear
a
man
speak
who
could
condescend
to
love
so
empty
and
so
vain
a
thing
as
that
then
she
became
gradually
ashamed
of
her
own
feelings
yes
she
said
i
think
i
should
like
to
hear
him
speak
only
if
i
were
not
quite
so
tired
hall
is
a
man
of
good
sense
and
well
educated
and
i
think
i
should
like
to
hear
him
i
should
like
to
hear
him
say
one
thing
i
know
said
sophy
then
lucy
in
her
rage
tore
asunder
some
fragment
of
a
garment
on
which
she
was
working
chapter
iii
sophy
wilson
goes
to
hastings
sophy
went
back
to
her
work
and
in
a
very
few
days
was
permanently
moved
from
the
seat
which
she
had
hitherto
occupied
next
to
alec
murray
and
near
to
lucy
to
a
distant
part
of
the
chamber
in
which
the
tinkling
instruments
were
used
and
as
a
part
of
the
arrangement
consequent
on
this
she
was
called
on
to
attend
from
ten
till
six
instead
of
from
noon
till
eight
and
her
hour
for
dining
was
changed
also
in
this
way
a
great
separation
between
the
girls
was
made
for
neither
could
they
walk
to
the
office
together
nor
walk
from
it
to
lucy
though
she
was
sometimes
inclined
to
be
angry
with
her
friend
this
was
very
painful
but
sophy
triumphed
in
it
greatly
i
think
we
are
to
have
a
step
up
to
in
the
musical
box
she
said
laughing
for
it
was
so
that
she
called
the
part
of
the
room
in
which
the
little
bells
were
always
ringing
won
t
it
be
nice
to
have
instead
of
lucy
said
solemnly
that
any
increase
of
income
was
always
nice
and
that
when
such
income
was
earned
by
superiority
of
acquirement
it
was
a
matter
of
just
pride
this
she
enunciated
with
something
of
a
dogmatic
air
having
schooled
herself
to
give
all
due
praise
to
sophy
although
it
had
to
be
given
at
the
expense
of
her
own
feelings
but
when
sophy
said
in
reply
that
that
was
just
what
she
had
been
thinking
herself
and
that
as
she
could
do
her
work
by
ear
she
was
of
course
worth
more
than
those
who
could
not
then
the
other
could
only
with
difficulty
repress
the
soreness
of
her
heart
but
to
sophy
i
think
the
new
arrangements
were
most
pleasant
because
it
enabled
her
to
reach
the
street
in
which
she
lived
just
when
abraham
hall
was
accustomed
to
return
from
his
work
he
would
generally
come
home
to
clean
himself
as
she
called
it
and
would
then
again
go
out
for
his
employment
or
amusement
for
the
evening
and
now
by
a
proper
system
of
lying
in
wait
by
creeping
slow
or
walking
quick
and
by
watching
well
she
was
generally
able
to
have
a
word
or
two
with
him
but
he
was
so
very
bashful
he
would
always
call
her
miss
wilson
and
she
of
course
was
obliged
to
call
him
hall
how
is
miss
graham
he
asked
one
evening
she
is
very
well
i
think
lucy
is
always
well
i
never
knew
anybody
so
strong
as
she
it
is
a
great
blessing
and
how
are
you
yourself
i
do
get
so
tired
at
that
nasty
office
though
of
course
i
like
what
i
am
doing
now
better
than
the
other
it
was
that
rolling
up
the
bands
that
used
to
kill
me
but
i
don
t
think
i
shall
ever
really
be
strong
till
i
get
away
from
the
telegraphs
i
suppose
you
have
no
young
ladies
where
you
are
there
are
i
believe
a
lot
of
them
in
the
building
stitching
bindings
but
i
never
see
i
don
t
think
you
care
much
for
young
ladies
not
much
why
not
now
what
does
that
mean
i
dare
say
i
never
told
you
or
miss
graham
before
but
i
had
a
wife
of
my
own
for
a
a
wife
you
yes
indeed
but
she
did
not
stay
with
me
long
she
left
me
before
we
had
been
a
year
left
you
she
died
he
said
correcting
very
quickly
the
false
impression
which
his
words
had
been
calculated
to
make
dear
me
died
before
a
year
was
out
how
sad
it
was
very
and
you
had
no
no
no
baby
hall
i
wish
she
had
had
none
because
then
she
would
have
been
still
living
yes
i
have
a
boy
poor
little
mortal
it
is
two
years
old
i
think
i
should
so
like
to
see
him
a
little
boy
do
bring
him
some
day
then
the
father
explained
that
the
child
was
in
the
country
down
in
hertfordshire
but
nevertheless
he
promised
that
he
would
some
day
bring
him
up
to
town
and
show
him
to
his
new
friends
surely
having
once
been
married
and
having
a
child
he
must
want
another
wife
and
yet
how
little
apt
he
was
to
say
or
do
any
of
those
things
by
saying
and
doing
which
men
are
supposed
to
express
their
desire
in
that
direction
he
was
very
slow
at
making
love
so
slow
that
sophy
hardly
found
herself
able
to
make
use
of
her
own
little
experiences
with
him
alec
murray
who
however
in
the
way
of
a
husband
was
not
worth
thinking
of
had
a
great
deal
more
to
say
for
himself
she
could
put
on
her
ribbons
for
hall
and
wait
for
him
in
the
street
and
look
up
into
his
face
and
call
him
hall
but
she
could
not
tell
him
how
dearly
she
would
love
that
little
boy
and
what
an
excellent
mother
she
would
be
to
him
unless
he
gave
her
some
encouragement
when
lucy
heard
that
he
had
been
a
married
man
and
that
he
had
a
child
she
was
gratified
though
she
knew
not
why
yes
i
should
like
to
see
him
of
course
she
said
speaking
of
the
boy
a
child
if
you
have
not
the
responsibility
of
taking
care
of
it
is
always
i
should
so
like
to
take
care
of
i
should
not
like
to
ask
him
to
bring
the
boy
up
out
of
the
she
paused
a
moment
and
then
added
he
is
just
the
man
whom
i
should
have
thought
would
have
married
and
just
the
man
to
be
made
very
serious
by
the
grief
of
such
a
loss
i
am
coming
to
think
it
does
a
person
good
to
have
to
bear
you
would
not
say
that
if
you
always
felt
as
sick
as
i
do
after
your
day
s
about
a
week
after
that
sophy
was
so
weak
in
the
middle
of
the
day
that
she
was
obliged
to
leave
the
office
and
go
home
i
know
it
will
kill
me
she
said
that
evening
if
i
go
on
with
it
the
place
is
so
stuffy
and
nasty
and
then
those
terrible
stairs
if
i
could
get
out
of
it
and
settle
down
then
i
should
be
quite
well
i
am
not
made
for
that
kind
of
work
not
like
you
i
think
i
was
made
for
it
it
is
such
a
blessing
to
be
strong
said
poor
sophy
yes
it
is
a
blessing
and
i
do
bless
god
that
he
has
made
me
so
it
is
the
one
good
thing
that
has
been
given
to
me
and
it
is
better
i
think
than
all
the
as
she
said
this
she
looked
at
sophy
and
thought
that
she
was
very
pretty
but
she
thought
also
that
prettiness
had
its
dangers
and
its
temptations
and
that
good
strong
serviceable
health
might
perhaps
be
better
for
one
who
had
to
earn
her
bread
but
through
all
these
thoughts
there
was
a
great
struggle
going
on
within
her
to
be
able
to
earn
one
s
bread
without
personal
suffering
is
very
good
to
be
tempted
by
prettiness
to
ribbons
pomatum
and
vanities
which
one
can
not
afford
is
very
bad
to
do
as
sophy
was
doing
in
regard
to
this
young
man
setting
her
cap
at
him
and
resolving
to
make
prey
of
him
as
a
fowler
does
of
a
bird
was
to
her
way
of
thinking
most
unseemly
but
to
be
loved
by
such
a
man
as
abraham
hall
to
be
chosen
by
him
as
his
companion
to
be
removed
from
the
hard
outside
unwomanly
work
of
the
world
to
the
indoor
occupations
which
a
husband
would
require
from
her
how
much
better
a
life
according
to
her
real
tastes
would
that
be
than
anything
which
she
now
saw
before
her
it
was
all
very
well
to
be
brown
and
strong
while
the
exigencies
of
her
position
were
those
which
now
surrounded
her
but
she
could
not
keep
herself
from
dreaming
of
something
which
would
have
been
much
better
than
that
a
month
or
two
passed
away
during
which
the
child
had
on
one
occasion
been
brought
up
to
town
on
a
saturday
evening
and
had
been
petted
and
washed
and
fed
and
generally
cared
for
by
the
two
girls
during
the
sunday
all
which
greatly
increased
their
intimacy
with
the
father
and
now
as
lucy
quickly
observed
abraham
hall
called
sophy
by
her
christian
name
when
the
word
was
first
pronounced
in
lucy
s
presence
sophy
blushed
and
looked
round
at
her
friend
but
she
never
said
that
the
change
had
been
made
at
her
own
request
i
do
so
hate
to
be
called
miss
wilson
she
had
said
it
seems
among
friends
as
though
i
were
a
hundred
years
then
he
had
called
her
sophy
but
she
did
not
dare
not
as
yet
to
call
him
abraham
all
which
the
other
girl
watched
very
closely
saying
nothing
but
during
these
two
months
sophy
had
been
away
from
her
office
more
than
half
the
time
then
the
doctor
said
she
had
better
leave
town
for
awhile
it
was
september
and
it
was
desired
that
she
should
pass
that
month
at
hastings
now
it
should
be
explained
that
in
such
emergencies
as
this
the
department
has
provided
a
most
kindly
aid
for
young
women
some
five
or
six
at
a
time
are
sent
out
for
a
month
to
hastings
or
to
brighton
and
are
employed
in
the
telegraph
offices
in
those
towns
their
railway
fares
are
paid
for
them
and
a
small
extra
allowance
is
made
to
them
to
enable
them
to
live
away
from
their
homes
the
privilege
is
too
generally
sought
to
be
always
at
the
command
of
her
who
wants
it
nor
is
it
accorded
except
on
the
doctor
s
certificate
but
in
the
september
sophy
wilson
was
sent
down
to
hastings
in
spite
however
of
the
official
benevolence
which
greatly
lightened
the
special
burden
which
illness
must
always
bring
on
those
who
have
to
earn
their
bread
and
which
in
sophy
wilson
s
case
had
done
so
much
for
her
nevertheless
the
weight
of
the
misfortune
fell
heavily
on
poor
lucy
some
little
struggle
had
to
be
made
as
to
clothes
before
the
girl
could
be
sent
away
from
her
home
and
though
the
sick
one
was
enabled
to
support
herself
at
hastings
the
cost
of
the
london
lodgings
which
should
have
been
divided
fell
entirely
upon
lucy
then
at
the
end
of
the
month
there
came
worse
tidings
the
doctor
at
hastings
declared
that
the
girl
was
unfit
to
go
back
to
her
work
was
indeed
altogether
unfit
for
such
effort
as
eight
hours
continued
attendance
required
from
her
she
wanted
at
any
rate
some
period
of
perfect
rest
and
therefore
she
remained
down
at
the
seaside
without
the
extra
allowance
which
was
so
much
needed
for
her
maintenance
then
the
struggle
became
very
severe
with
lucy
so
severe
that
she
began
to
doubt
whether
she
could
long
endure
it
sophy
had
her
two
shillings
a
day
the
of
her
wages
but
she
could
not
subsist
on
that
something
had
to
be
sent
to
her
in
addition
and
this
something
could
only
come
from
lucy
s
wages
so
at
least
it
was
at
first
in
order
to
avoid
debt
she
gave
up
her
more
comfortable
room
and
went
upstairs
into
a
little
garret
and
she
denied
herself
her
accustomed
dinner
at
the
office
contenting
herself
with
bread
and
cheese
or
often
simply
with
bread
which
she
could
take
in
her
pocket
and
she
washed
her
own
clothes
and
mended
even
her
own
boots
so
that
still
she
might
send
a
part
of
her
earnings
to
the
sick
one
is
she
better
abraham
asked
her
one
day
it
is
hard
to
know
hall
she
writes
just
as
she
feels
at
the
moment
i
am
afraid
she
fears
to
return
to
the
perhaps
it
does
not
suit
i
suppose
not
she
thinks
some
other
kind
of
life
would
be
better
for
her
i
dare
say
it
could
i
do
anything
asked
the
man
very
slowly
could
he
do
anything
well
yes
lucy
at
least
thought
that
he
could
do
a
great
deal
there
was
one
thing
which
if
he
would
do
it
would
make
sophy
at
any
rate
believe
herself
to
be
well
and
this
sickness
was
not
organic
was
not
as
it
appeared
due
to
any
cause
which
could
be
specified
it
had
not
as
yet
been
called
by
any
name
such
as
consumption
general
debility
had
been
spoken
of
both
by
the
office
doctor
and
by
him
at
hastings
now
lucy
certainly
thought
that
a
few
words
from
hall
would
do
more
than
all
the
doctors
in
the
way
of
effecting
a
cure
sophy
hated
the
telegraph
office
and
she
lacked
the
strength
of
mind
necessary
for
doing
that
which
was
distasteful
to
her
and
that
idea
of
a
husband
had
taken
such
hold
of
her
that
nothing
else
seemed
to
her
to
give
a
prospect
of
contentment
why
don
t
you
go
down
and
see
her
hall
she
said
then
he
was
silent
for
awhile
before
he
answered
silent
and
very
thoughtful
and
lucy
as
the
sound
of
her
own
words
rested
on
her
ears
felt
she
had
done
wrong
in
asking
such
a
question
why
should
he
go
down
unless
indeed
he
were
in
love
with
the
girl
and
prepared
to
ask
her
to
be
his
wife
if
he
were
to
go
down
expressly
to
visit
her
at
hastings
unless
he
were
so
prepared
what
false
hopes
he
would
raise
what
damage
he
would
do
instead
of
good
how
indeed
could
he
possibly
go
down
on
such
a
mission
without
declaring
to
all
the
world
that
he
intended
to
make
the
girl
his
wife
but
it
was
necessary
that
the
question
should
be
answered
i
could
do
no
good
by
that
he
said
no
perhaps
not
only
i
thought
what
did
you
think
now
he
asked
a
question
and
showed
plainly
by
his
manner
that
he
expected
an
answer
i
don
t
know
said
lucy
blushing
i
suppose
i
ought
not
to
have
thought
anything
but
you
seemed
to
be
so
fond
of
fond
of
her
well
one
does
get
fond
of
kind
neighbours
i
suppose
you
would
think
me
impertinent
miss
lucy
he
had
never
made
even
this
approach
to
familiarity
before
if
i
were
to
say
that
i
am
fond
of
both
of
no
indeed
she
replied
thinking
that
as
a
fondness
declared
by
a
young
man
for
two
girls
at
one
and
the
same
moment
could
not
be
interesting
so
neither
could
it
be
impertinent
i
don
t
think
i
should
do
any
good
by
going
down
all
that
kind
of
thing
costs
so
much
of
course
it
does
and
i
was
very
but
i
should
like
to
do
something
miss
and
then
he
put
his
hand
into
his
trousers
pocket
and
lucy
knew
that
he
was
going
to
bring
forth
money
she
was
very
poor
but
the
idea
of
taking
money
from
him
was
shocking
to
her
according
to
her
theory
of
life
even
though
sophy
had
been
engaged
to
the
man
as
his
promised
wife
she
should
not
consent
to
accept
maintenance
from
him
or
pecuniary
aid
till
she
had
been
made
in
very
truth
flesh
of
his
flesh
and
bone
of
his
bone
presents
an
engaged
girl
might
take
of
course
but
hardly
even
presents
of
simple
utility
a
shawl
might
be
given
so
that
it
was
a
pretty
thing
and
not
a
shawl
merely
for
warmth
an
engaged
girl
should
rather
live
on
bread
and
water
up
to
her
marriage
than
take
the
means
of
living
from
the
man
she
loved
till
she
could
take
it
by
right
of
having
become
his
wife
such
were
her
feelings
and
now
she
knew
that
this
man
was
about
to
offer
her
money
we
shall
do
very
well
she
said
sophy
and
i
you
are
very
hard
pinched
he
replied
you
have
given
up
your
yes
i
have
done
that
when
i
was
alone
i
did
not
want
so
big
a
i
suppose
i
understand
all
about
it
he
said
somewhat
roughly
or
perhaps
gruffly
would
be
the
better
word
i
think
there
is
one
thing
poor
people
ought
never
to
do
they
ought
never
to
be
ashamed
of
being
poor
among
then
she
looked
up
into
his
face
and
as
she
did
so
a
tear
formed
itself
in
each
of
her
eyes
am
i
ashamed
of
anything
before
you
she
asked
you
are
afraid
of
telling
the
truth
lest
i
should
offer
to
help
you
i
know
you
don
t
have
your
dinner
regular
as
you
who
has
dared
to
tell
you
that
hall
what
is
my
dinner
to
anybody
well
it
is
something
to
me
if
we
are
to
be
friends
of
course
i
don
t
like
seeing
you
go
without
your
meals
you
ll
be
ill
next
i
am
very
it
isn
t
the
way
to
keep
so
to
work
without
the
victuals
you
re
used
he
was
talking
to
her
now
in
such
a
tone
as
to
make
her
almost
feel
that
he
was
scolding
her
no
good
can
come
of
that
you
are
sending
your
money
down
to
hastings
to
of
course
we
share
you
wouldn
t
take
anything
from
me
for
yourself
i
dare
say
anybody
can
see
how
proud
you
are
but
if
i
leave
it
for
her
i
don
t
think
you
have
a
right
to
refuse
it
of
course
she
wants
it
if
you
don
with
that
he
brought
out
a
sovereign
and
put
it
down
on
the
table
indeed
i
couldn
t
hall
she
said
i
may
give
it
to
her
if
i
you
can
send
it
her
yourself
said
lucy
not
knowing
how
else
to
answer
him
no
i
couldn
t
i
don
t
know
her
then
without
waiting
for
another
word
he
walked
out
of
the
room
leaving
the
sovereign
on
the
table
this
occurred
in
a
small
back
parlour
on
the
ground
floor
which
was
in
the
occupation
of
the
landlady
but
was
used
sometimes
by
the
lodgers
for
such
occasional
meetings
what
was
she
to
do
with
the
sovereign
she
would
be
very
angry
if
any
man
were
to
send
her
a
sovereign
but
it
was
not
right
that
she
should
measure
sophy
s
feelings
by
her
own
and
then
it
might
still
be
that
the
man
was
sending
the
present
to
the
girl
whom
he
intended
to
make
his
wife
but
why
why
why
had
he
asked
about
her
dinner
what
were
her
affairs
to
him
would
she
not
have
gone
without
her
dinner
for
ever
rather
than
have
taken
it
at
his
hands
and
yet
who
was
there
in
all
the
world
of
whom
she
thought
so
well
as
of
him
and
so
she
took
the
sovereign
upstairs
with
her
into
her
garret
chapter
iv
brown
the
hairdresser
lucy
when
she
got
up
to
her
own
little
room
with
the
sovereign
sat
for
awhile
on
the
bed
crying
but
she
could
not
in
the
least
explain
to
herself
why
it
was
that
she
was
shedding
tears
at
this
moment
it
was
not
because
sophy
was
ill
though
that
was
cause
to
her
of
great
grief
nor
because
she
herself
was
so
hard
put
to
it
for
money
to
meet
her
wants
it
may
be
doubted
whether
grief
or
pain
ever
does
of
itself
produce
tears
which
are
rather
the
outcome
of
some
emotional
feeling
she
was
not
thinking
much
of
sophy
as
she
cried
nor
certainly
were
her
own
wants
present
to
her
mind
the
sovereign
was
between
her
fingers
but
she
did
not
at
first
even
turn
her
mind
to
that
or
consider
what
had
best
be
done
with
it
but
what
right
had
he
to
make
inquiry
as
to
her
poverty
it
was
that
she
told
herself
which
now
provoked
her
to
anger
so
that
she
wept
from
sheer
vexation
why
should
he
have
searched
into
her
wants
and
spoken
to
her
of
her
need
of
victuals
what
had
there
been
between
them
to
justify
him
in
tearing
away
that
veil
of
custom
which
is
always
supposed
to
hide
our
private
necessities
from
our
acquaintances
till
we
ourselves
feel
called
upon
to
declare
them
he
had
talked
to
her
about
her
meals
he
ought
to
know
that
she
would
starve
rather
than
accept
one
from
him
yes
she
was
very
angry
with
him
and
would
henceforth
keep
herself
aloof
from
him
but
still
as
she
sat
there
were
present
to
her
eyes
and
ears
the
form
and
words
of
an
heroic
man
he
had
seemed
to
scold
her
but
there
are
female
hearts
which
can
be
better
reached
and
more
surely
touched
by
the
truth
of
anger
than
by
the
patent
falseness
of
flattery
had
he
paid
her
compliments
she
would
not
now
have
been
crying
nor
would
she
have
complained
to
herself
of
his
usage
but
she
certainly
would
not
have
sat
thinking
of
him
wondering
what
sort
of
woman
had
been
that
young
wife
to
whom
he
had
first
given
himself
wondering
whether
it
was
possible
that
sophy
should
be
good
enough
for
him
then
she
got
up
and
looking
down
upon
her
own
hand
gazed
at
the
sovereign
till
she
had
made
up
her
mind
what
she
would
do
with
it
she
at
once
sat
down
and
wrote
to
sophy
she
had
made
up
her
mind
there
should
be
no
diminution
in
the
contribution
made
from
her
own
wages
in
no
way
should
any
portion
of
that
sovereign
administer
to
her
own
comfort
though
she
might
want
her
accustomed
victuals
ever
so
badly
they
should
not
come
to
her
from
his
earnings
so
she
told
sophy
in
the
letter
that
hall
had
expressed
great
anxiety
for
her
welfare
and
had
begged
that
she
would
accept
a
present
from
him
she
was
to
get
anything
with
the
sovereign
that
might
best
tend
to
her
happiness
but
the
shilling
a
day
which
lucy
contributed
out
of
her
own
wages
was
sent
with
the
sovereign
for
an
entire
month
she
did
not
see
abraham
hall
again
so
as
to
do
more
than
just
speak
to
him
on
the
stairs
she
was
almost
inclined
to
think
that
he
was
cold
and
unkind
in
not
seeking
her
and
yet
she
wilfully
kept
out
of
his
way
on
each
sunday
it
would
at
any
rate
have
been
easy
for
her
to
meet
him
but
with
a
stubborn
purpose
which
she
did
not
herself
understand
she
kept
herself
apart
and
when
she
met
him
on
the
stairs
which
she
would
do
occasionally
when
she
returned
from
her
work
she
would
hardly
stand
till
she
had
answered
his
inquiries
after
sophy
but
at
the
end
of
the
month
one
evening
he
came
up
and
knocked
at
her
door
i
am
sorry
to
intrude
miss
it
is
no
intrusion
hall
i
wish
i
had
a
place
to
ask
you
to
sit
down
i
have
come
to
bring
another
trifle
for
miss
pray
do
not
do
it
i
can
not
send
it
her
she
ought
not
to
take
it
i
am
sure
you
know
that
she
ought
not
to
take
i
know
nothing
of
the
kind
if
i
know
anything
it
is
that
the
strong
should
help
the
weak
and
the
healthy
the
sick
why
should
she
not
take
it
from
me
as
well
as
from
you
it
was
necessary
that
lucy
should
think
a
little
before
she
could
answer
this
but
when
she
had
thought
her
answer
was
ready
we
are
both
is
there
anything
which
ought
to
confine
kindness
to
this
or
the
other
sex
if
you
were
knocked
down
in
the
street
would
you
let
no
one
but
a
woman
pick
you
up
it
is
not
the
same
i
know
you
understand
it
hall
i
am
sure
you
then
he
also
paused
to
think
what
he
would
say
for
he
was
conscious
that
he
did
understand
for
a
young
woman
to
accept
money
from
a
man
seemed
to
imply
that
some
return
of
favours
would
be
due
but
he
said
to
himself
that
feeling
came
from
what
was
dirty
and
not
from
what
was
noble
in
the
world
you
ought
to
lift
yourself
above
all
that
he
said
at
last
yes
you
ought
you
are
very
good
but
you
would
be
better
if
you
would
do
so
you
say
that
i
understand
and
i
think
that
you
too
this
again
was
said
in
that
voice
which
seemed
to
scold
and
again
her
eyes
became
full
of
tears
then
he
was
softer
on
a
sudden
good
night
miss
lucy
you
will
shake
hands
with
me
will
you
not
she
put
her
hand
in
his
being
perfectly
conscious
at
the
moment
that
it
was
the
first
time
that
she
had
ever
done
so
what
a
mighty
hand
it
seemed
to
be
as
it
held
hers
for
a
moment
i
will
put
the
sovereign
on
the
table
he
said
again
leaving
the
room
and
giving
her
no
option
as
to
its
acceptance
but
she
made
up
her
mind
at
once
that
she
would
not
be
the
means
of
sending
his
money
to
sophy
wilson
she
was
sure
that
she
would
take
nothing
from
him
for
her
own
relief
and
therefore
sure
that
neither
ought
sophy
to
do
so
at
any
rate
unless
there
had
been
more
between
them
than
either
of
them
had
told
to
her
but
sophy
must
judge
for
herself
she
sent
therefore
the
sovereign
back
to
hall
with
a
little
note
as
follows
dear
hall
sophy
s
address
is
at
mrs
pike
s
paradise
row
fairlight
near
hastings
you
can
do
as
you
like
as
to
writing
to
her
i
am
obliged
to
send
back
the
money
which
you
have
so
left
for
her
because
i
do
not
think
she
ought
to
accept
it
if
she
were
quite
in
want
it
might
be
different
but
we
have
still
five
shillings
a
day
between
us
if
a
young
woman
were
starving
perhaps
it
ought
to
be
the
same
as
though
she
were
being
run
over
in
the
street
but
it
is
not
like
that
in
my
next
letter
i
shall
tell
sophy
all
about
it
yours
truly
lucy
the
following
evening
when
she
came
home
he
was
standing
at
the
house
door
evidently
waiting
for
her
she
had
never
seen
him
loitering
in
that
way
before
and
she
was
sure
that
he
was
there
in
order
that
he
might
speak
to
her
i
thought
i
would
let
you
know
that
i
got
the
sovereign
safely
he
said
i
am
so
sorry
that
you
should
have
returned
i
am
sure
that
i
was
right
there
are
cases
in
which
it
is
very
hard
to
say
what
is
right
and
what
is
wrong
some
things
seem
right
because
people
have
been
wrong
so
long
to
give
and
take
among
friends
ought
to
be
we
can
only
do
what
we
think
right
she
said
as
she
passed
in
through
the
passage
upstairs
she
felt
sure
from
what
had
passed
that
he
had
not
sent
the
money
to
sophy
but
why
not
sophy
had
said
that
he
was
bashful
was
he
so
far
bashful
that
he
did
not
dare
himself
to
send
the
money
to
the
girl
he
loved
though
he
had
no
scruple
as
to
giving
it
to
her
through
another
person
and
as
for
bashfulness
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
man
spoke
out
his
mind
clearly
enough
he
could
scold
her
she
thought
without
any
difficulty
for
it
still
seemed
that
his
voice
and
manner
were
rough
to
her
he
was
never
rough
to
sophy
but
then
she
had
heard
so
often
that
love
will
alter
a
man
amazingly
then
she
wrote
her
letter
to
sophy
and
explained
as
well
as
she
could
the
whole
affair
she
was
quite
sure
that
sophy
would
regret
the
loss
of
the
money
sophy
she
knew
would
have
accepted
it
without
scruple
people
she
said
to
herself
will
be
different
but
she
endeavoured
to
make
her
friend
understand
that
she
with
her
feelings
could
not
be
the
medium
of
sending
on
presents
of
which
she
disapproved
i
have
given
him
your
address
she
said
and
he
can
suit
himself
as
to
writing
to
in
this
letter
she
enclosed
a
money
order
for
the
contribution
made
to
sophy
s
comfort
out
of
her
own
wages
sophy
s
answer
which
came
in
a
day
or
two
surprised
her
very
much
as
to
hall
s
money
she
began
as
things
stand
at
present
perhaps
it
is
as
well
that
you
didn
t
take
as
lucy
had
expected
that
grievous
fault
would
be
found
with
her
this
was
comfortable
but
it
was
after
that
that
the
real
news
came
sophy
was
a
great
deal
better
that
was
also
good
tidings
but
she
did
not
want
to
leave
hastings
just
at
present
indeed
she
thought
that
she
did
not
want
to
leave
it
at
all
a
very
gentlemanlike
young
man
who
was
just
going
to
be
taken
into
partnership
in
a
hairdressing
establishment
had
proposed
to
her
and
she
had
accepted
him
then
there
were
two
wishes
expressed
the
first
was
that
lucy
would
go
on
a
little
longer
with
her
kind
generosity
and
the
second
that
hall
would
not
feel
it
very
much
as
regarded
the
first
wish
lucy
resolved
that
she
would
go
on
at
least
for
the
present
sophy
was
still
on
sick
leave
from
the
office
and
even
though
she
might
be
engaged
to
a
hairdresser
was
still
to
be
regarded
as
an
invalid
but
as
to
hall
she
thought
that
she
could
do
nothing
she
could
not
even
tell
him
at
any
rate
till
that
marriage
at
hastings
was
quite
a
settled
thing
but
she
thought
that
hall
s
future
happiness
would
not
be
lessened
by
the
event
though
she
had
taught
herself
to
love
sophy
she
had
been
unable
not
to
think
that
her
friend
was
not
a
fitting
wife
for
such
a
man
but
in
telling
herself
that
he
would
have
an
escape
she
put
it
to
herself
as
though
the
fault
lay
chiefly
in
him
he
is
so
stern
and
so
hard
that
he
would
have
crushed
her
and
she
never
would
have
understood
his
justness
and
in
her
letter
of
congratulation
which
was
very
kind
she
said
not
a
word
of
abraham
hall
but
she
promised
to
go
on
with
her
own
contribution
till
things
were
a
little
more
settled
in
the
meantime
she
was
very
poor
even
brown
dresses
won
t
wear
for
ever
let
them
be
ever
so
brown
and
in
the
first
flurry
of
sending
sophy
off
to
hastings
with
that
decent
apparel
which
had
perhaps
been
the
means
of
winning
the
hairdresser
s
heart
she
had
got
somewhat
into
debt
with
her
landlady
this
she
was
gradually
paying
off
even
on
her
reduced
wages
but
the
effort
pinched
her
closely
day
by
day
in
spite
of
all
her
efforts
with
her
needle
she
became
sensible
of
a
deterioration
in
her
outward
appearance
which
was
painful
to
her
at
the
office
and
which
made
her
most
careful
to
avoid
any
meeting
with
abraham
hall
her
boots
were
very
bad
and
she
had
now
for
some
time
given
up
even
the
pretence
of
gloves
as
she
went
backwards
and
forwards
to
the
office
but
perhaps
it
was
her
hat
that
was
most
vexatious
the
brown
straw
hat
which
had
lasted
her
all
the
summer
and
autumn
could
hardly
be
induced
to
keep
its
shape
now
when
november
was
come
one
day
about
three
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
abraham
hall
went
to
the
post
office
and
having
inquired
among
the
messengers
made
his
way
up
to
the
telegraph
department
at
the
top
of
the
building
there
he
asked
for
miss
graham
and
was
told
by
the
doorkeeper
that
the
young
ladies
were
not
allowed
to
receive
visitors
during
office
hours
he
persisted
however
explaining
that
he
had
no
wish
to
go
into
the
room
but
that
it
was
a
matter
of
importance
and
that
he
was
very
anxious
that
miss
graham
should
be
asked
to
come
out
to
him
now
it
is
a
rule
that
the
staff
of
the
department
who
are
engaged
in
sending
and
receiving
messages
the
privacy
of
which
may
be
of
vital
importance
should
be
kept
during
the
hours
of
work
as
free
as
possible
from
communication
with
the
public
it
is
not
that
either
the
girls
or
the
young
men
would
be
prone
to
tell
the
words
which
they
had
been
the
means
of
passing
on
to
their
destination
but
that
it
might
be
worth
the
while
of
some
sinner
to
offer
great
temptation
and
that
the
power
of
offering
it
should
be
lessened
as
much
as
possible
therefore
when
abraham
hall
pressed
his
request
the
doorkeeper
told
him
that
it
was
quite
impossible
do
you
mean
to
say
that
if
it
were
an
affair
of
life
and
death
she
could
not
be
called
out
abraham
asked
in
that
voice
which
had
sometimes
seemed
to
lucy
to
be
so
impressive
she
is
not
a
prisoner
i
don
t
know
as
to
that
replied
the
man
you
would
have
to
see
the
superintendent
i
then
let
me
see
the
and
at
last
he
did
succeed
in
seeing
some
one
whom
he
so
convinced
of
the
importance
of
his
message
as
to
bring
lucy
to
the
door
miss
graham
he
said
when
they
were
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
so
far
alone
that
no
one
else
could
hear
him
i
want
you
to
come
out
with
me
for
half
an
i
don
t
think
i
can
they
won
t
let
yes
they
will
i
have
to
say
something
which
i
must
say
will
not
the
evening
do
hall
no
i
must
go
out
of
town
by
the
mail
train
from
paddington
and
it
will
be
too
late
get
your
hat
and
come
with
me
for
half
an
then
she
remembered
her
hat
and
she
snatched
a
glance
at
her
poor
stained
dress
and
she
looked
up
at
him
he
was
not
dressed
in
his
working
clothes
and
his
face
and
hands
were
clean
and
altogether
there
was
a
look
about
him
of
manly
tidiness
which
added
to
her
feeling
of
shame
if
you
will
go
on
to
the
house
i
will
follow
you
she
said
are
you
ashamed
to
walk
with
me
i
am
because
he
had
not
understood
her
at
first
but
now
he
understood
it
all
get
your
hat
he
said
and
come
with
a
friend
who
is
really
a
friend
you
must
come
you
must
then
she
felt
herself
compelled
to
obey
and
went
back
and
got
her
old
hat
and
followed
him
down
the
stairs
into
the
street
and
so
miss
wilson
is
going
to
be
married
were
the
first
words
he
said
in
the
street
has
she
written
to
you
yes
she
has
told
me
all
about
it
i
am
so
glad
that
she
should
be
settled
to
her
liking
out
of
town
she
says
that
she
is
nearly
well
now
i
hope
that
brown
is
a
good
sort
of
man
and
that
he
will
be
kind
to
it
could
hardly
be
possible
lucy
thought
that
he
should
have
taken
her
away
from
the
office
merely
to
talk
to
her
of
sophy
s
prospects
it
was
evident
that
he
was
strong
enough
to
conceal
any
chagrin
which
might
have
been
caused
by
sophy
s
apostacy
could
it
however
be
the
case
that
he
was
going
to
leave
london
because
his
feelings
had
been
too
much
disturbed
to
allow
of
his
remaining
quiet
and
so
you
are
going
away
is
it
for
long
well
yes
i
suppose
it
is
for
then
there
came
upon
her
a
sense
of
increased
desolation
was
he
not
her
only
friend
and
then
though
she
had
refused
all
pecuniary
assistance
there
had
been
present
to
her
a
feeling
that
there
was
near
to
her
a
strong
human
being
whom
she
could
trust
and
who
in
any
last
extremity
could
be
kind
to
her
for
always
and
you
go
then
she
thought
that
he
had
been
right
to
insist
on
seeing
her
it
would
certainly
have
been
a
great
blow
to
her
if
he
had
gone
without
a
word
of
farewell
there
is
a
man
wanted
immediately
to
look
after
the
engines
at
a
great
establishment
on
the
wye
in
the
forest
of
dean
they
have
offered
me
four
pounds
a
four
pounds
a
week
but
i
must
go
at
once
it
has
been
talked
about
for
some
time
and
now
it
has
come
all
in
a
clap
i
have
to
be
off
without
a
day
s
notice
almost
before
i
know
where
i
am
as
for
leaving
london
it
is
just
what
i
like
i
love
the
oh
yes
said
lucy
that
will
be
nice
and
about
your
little
boy
could
it
be
that
she
was
to
be
asked
to
do
something
for
the
child
they
were
now
at
the
door
of
their
house
here
we
are
he
said
and
perhaps
i
can
say
better
inside
what
i
have
got
to
then
she
followed
him
into
the
back
on
the
ground
floor
chapter
abraham
hall
married
yes
he
said
about
my
little
boy
i
could
not
say
what
i
had
to
say
in
the
street
though
i
had
thought
to
do
then
he
paused
and
she
sat
herself
down
feeling
she
did
not
know
why
as
though
she
would
lack
strength
to
hear
him
if
she
stood
it
was
then
the
case
that
some
particular
service
was
to
be
demanded
from
her
something
that
would
show
his
confidence
in
her
the
very
idea
of
this
seemed
at
once
to
add
a
grace
to
her
life
she
would
have
the
child
to
love
there
would
be
something
for
her
to
do
and
there
must
be
letters
between
her
and
him
it
would
certainly
add
a
grace
to
her
life
but
how
odd
that
he
should
not
take
his
child
with
him
he
had
paused
a
moment
while
she
thought
of
all
this
and
she
was
aware
that
he
was
looking
at
her
but
she
did
not
dare
to
return
his
gaze
or
even
to
glance
up
at
his
face
and
then
gradually
she
felt
that
she
was
shivering
and
trembling
what
was
it
that
ailed
her
just
now
when
it
would
be
so
necessary
that
she
should
speak
out
with
some
strength
she
had
eaten
nothing
since
her
breakfast
when
he
had
come
to
her
and
she
was
afraid
that
she
would
show
herself
to
be
weak
will
you
be
his
mother
he
said
what
did
it
mean
how
was
she
to
answer
him
she
knew
that
his
eyes
were
on
her
but
hers
were
more
than
ever
firmly
fixed
upon
the
floor
and
she
was
aware
that
she
ought
briskly
to
have
acceded
to
his
request
so
as
to
have
shown
by
her
ready
alacrity
that
she
had
attributed
no
other
meaning
to
the
words
than
they
had
been
intended
to
convey
that
she
had
not
for
a
moment
been
guilty
of
rash
folly
but
though
it
was
so
imperative
upon
her
to
say
a
word
yet
she
could
not
speak
everything
was
swimming
round
her
she
was
not
even
sure
that
she
could
sit
upon
her
chair
lucy
he
said
then
she
thought
she
would
have
fallen
lucy
will
you
be
my
wife
there
was
no
doubt
about
the
word
her
sense
of
hearing
was
at
any
rate
not
deficient
and
there
came
upon
her
at
once
a
thorough
conviction
that
all
her
troubles
had
been
changed
for
ever
and
a
day
into
joys
and
blessings
the
word
had
been
spoken
from
which
he
certainly
would
never
go
back
and
which
of
course
of
course
must
be
a
commandment
to
her
but
yet
there
was
an
unfitness
about
it
which
disturbed
her
and
she
was
still
powerless
to
speak
the
remembrance
of
the
meanness
of
her
clothes
and
poorness
of
her
position
came
upon
her
so
that
it
would
be
her
duty
to
tell
him
that
she
was
not
fit
for
him
and
yet
she
could
not
speak
if
you
will
say
that
you
want
time
to
think
about
it
i
shall
be
contented
he
said
but
she
did
not
want
a
moment
to
think
about
it
she
could
not
have
confessed
to
herself
that
she
had
learned
to
love
him
oh
so
much
too
dearly
if
it
were
not
for
this
most
unexpected
most
unthought
of
almost
impossible
revelation
but
she
did
not
want
a
moment
to
make
herself
sure
that
she
did
love
him
yet
she
could
not
speak
will
you
say
that
you
will
think
of
it
for
a
month
then
there
came
upon
her
an
idea
that
he
was
not
asking
this
because
he
loved
her
but
in
order
that
he
might
have
a
mother
whom
he
could
trust
for
his
child
even
that
would
have
been
flattering
but
that
would
not
have
sufficed
then
when
she
told
herself
what
she
was
or
rather
what
she
thought
herself
to
be
she
felt
sure
that
he
could
not
really
love
her
why
should
such
a
man
as
he
love
such
a
woman
then
her
mouth
was
opened
you
can
not
want
me
for
myself
she
said
not
for
yourself
then
why
i
am
not
the
man
to
seek
any
girl
for
her
fortune
and
you
have
then
again
she
was
dumfounded
she
could
not
explain
what
she
meant
she
could
not
say
because
i
am
brown
and
because
i
am
plain
and
because
i
have
become
thin
and
worn
from
want
and
because
my
clothes
are
old
and
shabby
i
ask
you
he
said
because
with
all
my
heart
i
love
it
was
as
though
the
heavens
had
been
opened
to
her
that
he
should
speak
a
word
that
was
not
true
was
to
her
impossible
and
as
it
was
so
she
would
not
coy
her
love
to
him
for
a
moment
if
only
she
could
have
found
words
with
which
to
speak
to
him
she
could
not
even
look
up
at
him
but
she
put
out
her
hand
so
as
to
touch
him
lucy
he
said
stand
up
and
come
to
then
she
stood
up
and
with
one
little
step
crept
close
to
his
side
lucy
can
you
love
me
and
as
he
asked
the
question
his
arm
was
pressed
round
her
waist
and
as
she
put
up
her
hand
to
welcome
rather
than
to
restrain
his
embrace
she
again
felt
the
strength
the
support
and
the
warmth
of
his
grasp
will
you
not
say
that
you
love
me
i
am
such
a
poor
thing
she
replied
a
poor
thing
are
you
well
yes
there
are
different
ways
of
being
poor
i
have
been
poor
enough
in
my
time
but
i
never
thought
myself
a
poor
thing
and
you
must
not
say
it
ever
of
yourself
no
my
girl
must
not
think
herself
a
poor
thing
may
i
not
say
my
girl
then
there
was
just
a
little
murmur
a
sound
which
would
have
been
yes
but
for
the
inability
of
her
lips
to
open
themselves
and
if
my
girl
then
my
wife
and
shall
my
wife
be
called
a
poor
thing
no
lucy
i
have
seen
it
all
i
don
t
think
i
like
poor
things
but
i
like
do
you
i
do
and
now
i
must
go
back
to
the
city
road
and
give
up
charge
and
take
my
money
and
i
must
leave
this
at
seven
after
a
cup
of
tea
shall
i
see
you
again
see
me
again
oh
you
mean
indeed
you
shall
not
see
you
off
my
own
own
own
man
what
will
they
say
at
the
office
i
don
t
care
what
they
say
let
them
say
what
they
like
i
have
never
been
absent
a
day
yet
without
leave
what
time
shall
i
be
here
then
he
named
an
hour
of
course
i
will
have
your
last
words
perhaps
you
will
tell
me
something
that
i
must
i
must
leave
some
money
with
no
no
no
not
yet
that
shall
come
this
she
said
smiling
up
at
him
with
a
sparkle
of
a
tear
in
each
eye
but
with
such
a
smile
then
he
caught
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
that
may
come
at
present
at
any
rate
he
said
to
this
though
it
was
repeated
once
and
again
there
was
no
opposition
then
in
his
own
masterful
manner
he
put
on
his
hat
and
stalked
out
of
the
room
without
any
more
words
she
must
return
to
the
office
that
afternoon
of
course
if
only
for
the
sake
of
explaining
her
wish
to
absent
herself
the
rest
of
the
day
but
she
could
not
go
forth
into
the
streets
just
yet
though
she
had
been
able
to
smile
at
him
and
to
return
his
caress
and
for
a
moment
so
to
stand
by
him
that
she
might
have
something
of
the
delight
of
his
love
still
she
was
too
much
flurried
too
weak
from
the
excitement
of
the
last
to
walk
back
to
the
post
office
without
allowing
herself
some
minutes
to
recruit
her
strength
and
collect
her
thoughts
she
went
at
once
up
to
her
own
room
and
cut
for
herself
a
bit
of
bread
which
she
began
to
eat
just
as
one
would
trim
one
s
lamp
carefully
for
some
night
work
even
though
oppressed
by
heaviest
sorrow
or
put
fuel
on
the
fire
that
would
be
needed
then
having
fed
herself
she
leaned
back
in
her
chair
throwing
her
handkerchief
over
her
face
in
order
that
she
might
think
of
it
oh
how
much
there
was
to
fill
her
mind
with
many
thoughts
looking
back
to
what
she
had
been
even
an
hour
ago
and
then
assuring
herself
with
infinite
delight
of
the
certain
happiness
of
her
present
position
she
told
herself
that
all
the
world
had
been
altered
to
her
within
that
short
space
as
for
loving
him
there
was
no
doubt
about
that
now
she
could
own
to
herself
that
she
had
long
since
loved
him
even
when
she
thought
that
he
might
probably
take
that
other
girl
as
his
wife
that
she
should
love
him
was
it
not
a
matter
of
course
he
being
what
he
was
but
that
he
should
love
her
that
that
was
the
marvel
but
he
did
she
need
not
doubt
that
she
could
remember
distinctly
each
word
of
assurance
that
he
had
spoken
to
her
i
ask
you
because
with
all
my
heart
i
love
may
i
not
say
my
girl
and
if
my
girl
then
my
wife
i
do
not
think
that
i
like
poor
things
but
i
like
no
if
she
were
regarded
by
him
as
good
enough
to
be
his
wife
then
she
would
certainly
never
call
herself
a
poor
thing
again
in
her
troubles
and
her
poverty
especially
in
her
solitude
she
had
often
thought
of
that
other
older
man
who
had
wanted
to
make
her
his
wife
sometimes
almost
with
regret
there
would
have
been
duties
for
her
and
a
home
and
a
mode
of
life
more
fitting
to
her
feminine
nature
than
this
solitary
tedious
existence
and
there
would
have
been
something
for
her
to
love
some
human
being
on
whom
to
spend
her
human
solicitude
and
sympathies
she
had
leagued
herself
with
sophy
wilson
and
she
had
been
true
to
the
bond
but
it
had
had
in
it
but
little
satisfaction
the
other
life
she
had
sometimes
thought
would
have
been
better
but
she
had
never
loved
the
man
and
could
not
have
loved
him
as
a
husband
should
she
thought
be
loved
by
his
wife
she
had
done
what
was
right
in
refusing
the
good
things
which
he
had
offered
her
and
now
she
was
rewarded
now
had
come
to
her
the
bliss
of
which
she
had
dreamed
that
of
belonging
to
a
man
to
whom
she
felt
that
she
was
bound
by
all
the
chords
of
her
heart
then
she
repeated
his
name
to
herself
abraham
hall
and
tried
in
a
lowest
whisper
the
sound
of
that
other
name
lucy
hall
and
she
opened
her
arms
wide
as
she
sat
upon
the
chair
as
though
in
that
way
she
could
take
his
child
to
her
bosom
she
had
been
sitting
so
nearly
an
hour
when
she
started
up
suddenly
and
again
put
on
her
old
hat
and
hurried
off
towards
her
office
she
felt
now
that
as
regarded
her
clothes
she
did
not
care
about
herself
there
was
a
paradise
prepared
for
her
so
dear
and
so
near
that
the
present
was
made
quite
bright
by
merely
being
the
short
path
to
such
a
future
but
for
his
sake
she
cared
as
belonging
to
him
she
would
fain
had
it
been
possible
not
have
shown
herself
in
a
garb
unfitting
for
his
wife
everything
about
him
had
always
been
decent
fitting
and
serviceable
well
it
was
his
own
doing
he
had
chosen
her
as
she
was
she
would
not
run
in
debt
to
make
herself
fit
for
his
notice
because
such
debts
would
have
been
debts
to
be
paid
by
him
but
if
she
could
squeeze
from
her
food
what
should
supply
her
with
garments
fit
at
any
rate
to
stand
with
him
at
the
altar
it
should
be
done
then
as
she
hurried
on
to
the
office
she
remembered
what
he
had
said
about
money
no
she
would
not
have
his
money
till
it
was
hers
of
right
then
with
what
perfect
satisfaction
would
she
take
from
him
whatever
he
pleased
to
give
her
and
how
hard
would
she
work
for
him
in
order
that
he
might
never
feel
that
he
had
given
her
his
good
things
for
nothing
it
was
five
o
clock
before
she
was
at
the
office
and
she
had
promised
to
be
back
in
the
lodgings
at
six
to
get
for
him
his
tea
it
was
quite
out
of
the
question
that
she
should
work
the
truth
is
ma
am
she
said
to
the
female
superintendent
i
have
received
and
accepted
an
offer
of
marriage
this
afternoon
he
is
going
out
of
town
and
i
want
to
be
with
him
before
he
this
is
a
plea
against
which
official
rigour
can
not
prevail
i
remember
once
when
a
young
man
applied
to
a
saturnine
pundit
who
ruled
matters
in
a
certain
office
for
leave
of
absence
for
a
month
to
get
married
to
get
married
said
the
saturnine
pundit
poor
fellow
but
you
must
have
the
the
lady
at
the
telegraph
office
was
no
doubt
less
caustic
and
dismissed
our
lucy
for
the
day
with
congratulations
rather
than
pity
she
was
back
at
the
lodging
before
her
lover
and
had
borrowed
the
little
back
parlour
from
green
and
had
spread
the
and
herself
made
the
toast
in
the
kitchen
before
he
came
there
s
something
i
suppose
more
nor
friendship
betwixt
you
and
hall
and
better
said
the
landlady
smiling
a
great
deal
better
green
lucy
had
replied
with
her
face
intent
upon
the
toast
i
thought
it
never
could
have
been
that
other
young
lady
said
green
and
now
my
dear
about
money
said
abraham
as
he
rose
to
prepare
himself
for
the
journey
many
things
had
been
settled
over
that
meal
how
he
was
to
get
a
house
ready
and
was
then
to
say
when
she
should
come
to
him
and
how
she
should
bring
the
boy
with
her
and
how
he
would
have
the
banns
called
in
the
church
and
how
they
would
be
married
as
soon
as
possible
after
her
arrival
in
the
new
country
and
now
my
dear
about
money
she
had
to
take
it
at
last
yes
she
said
it
is
right
that
i
should
have
things
fit
to
come
to
you
in
it
is
right
that
you
shouldn
t
be
i
d
marry
you
in
a
sack
from
the
if
it
were
necessary
he
said
with
vehemence
as
it
is
not
necessary
it
shall
not
be
so
i
will
get
things
but
they
shall
belong
to
you
always
and
i
will
not
wear
them
till
the
day
that
i
also
shall
belong
to
she
went
with
him
that
night
to
the
station
and
kissed
him
openly
as
she
parted
from
him
on
the
platform
there
was
nothing
in
her
love
now
of
which
she
was
ashamed
how
after
some
necessary
interval
she
followed
him
down
into
gloucestershire
and
how
she
became
his
wife
standing
opposite
to
him
in
the
bright
raiment
which
his
liberality
had
supplied
and
how
she
became
as
good
a
wife
as
ever
blessed
a
man
s
household
need
hardly
here
be
told
that
miss
wilson
recovered
her
health
and
married
the
hairdresser
may
be
accepted
by
all
anxious
readers
as
an
undoubted
fact
alice
dugdale
chapter
i
the
doctor
s
family
it
used
to
be
said
in
the
village
of
beetham
that
nothing
ever
went
wrong
with
alice
dugdale
the
meaning
of
which
perhaps
lay
in
the
fact
that
she
was
determined
that
things
should
be
made
to
go
right
things
as
they
came
were
received
by
her
with
a
gracious
welcome
and
things
whatever
they
were
seemed
to
be
so
well
pleased
with
the
treatment
afforded
to
them
that
they
too
for
most
part
made
themselves
gracious
in
return
nevertheless
she
had
had
sorrows
as
who
has
not
but
she
had
kept
her
tears
for
herself
and
had
shown
her
smiles
for
the
comfort
of
those
around
her
in
this
little
story
it
shall
be
told
how
in
a
certain
period
of
her
life
she
had
suffered
much
how
she
still
smiled
and
how
at
last
she
got
the
better
of
her
sorrow
her
father
was
the
country
doctor
in
the
populous
and
straggling
parish
of
beetham
beetham
is
one
of
those
places
so
often
found
in
the
south
of
england
half
village
half
town
for
the
existence
of
which
there
seems
to
be
no
special
reason
it
had
no
mayor
no
municipality
no
market
no
pavements
and
no
gas
it
was
therefore
no
more
than
a
village
but
it
had
a
doctor
and
alice
s
father
dugdale
was
the
man
he
had
been
established
at
beetham
for
more
than
thirty
years
and
knew
every
pulse
and
every
tongue
for
ten
miles
round
i
do
not
know
that
he
was
very
great
as
a
doctor
but
he
was
a
liberal
man
and
he
enjoyed
the
confidence
of
the
beethamites
which
is
everything
for
thirty
years
he
had
worked
hard
and
had
brought
up
a
large
family
without
want
he
was
still
working
hard
though
turned
sixty
at
the
time
of
which
we
are
speaking
he
had
even
in
his
old
age
many
children
dependent
on
him
and
though
he
had
fairly
prospered
he
had
not
become
a
rich
man
he
had
been
married
twice
and
alice
was
the
only
child
left
at
home
by
his
first
wife
two
elder
sisters
were
married
and
an
elder
brother
was
away
in
the
world
alice
had
been
much
younger
than
they
and
had
been
the
only
child
living
with
him
when
he
had
brought
to
his
house
a
second
mother
for
her
she
was
then
fifteen
eight
or
nine
years
had
since
gone
and
almost
every
year
had
brought
an
increase
to
the
doctor
s
family
there
were
now
seven
little
dugdales
in
and
about
the
nursery
and
what
the
seven
would
do
when
alice
should
go
away
the
folk
of
beetham
always
declared
that
they
were
quite
at
a
loss
even
to
guess
for
dugdale
was
one
of
those
women
who
succumb
to
difficulties
who
seem
originally
to
have
been
made
of
soft
material
and
to
have
become
warped
out
of
joint
tattered
and
almost
useless
under
the
wear
of
the
world
but
alice
had
been
constructed
of
thoroughly
seasoned
timber
so
that
let
her
be
knocked
about
as
she
might
she
was
never
out
of
repair
now
the
doctor
excellent
as
he
was
at
doctoring
was
not
very
good
at
household
matters
so
that
the
folk
at
beetham
had
reason
to
be
at
a
loss
when
they
bethought
themselves
as
to
what
would
happen
when
alice
should
go
of
course
there
is
always
that
prospect
of
a
girl
s
going
girls
not
unfrequently
intend
to
go
away
sometimes
they
go
away
very
suddenly
without
any
previous
intention
at
any
rate
such
a
girl
as
alice
can
not
be
regarded
as
a
fixture
in
a
house
binding
as
may
be
her
duties
at
home
it
is
quite
understood
that
should
any
adequate
provocation
to
go
away
be
brought
within
her
reach
she
will
go
let
the
duties
be
what
they
may
alice
was
a
thoroughly
good
girl
good
to
her
father
good
to
her
little
brothers
and
sisters
unutterably
good
to
that
poor
foolish
stepmother
but
no
doubt
she
would
go
away
if
duly
asked
when
that
vista
of
future
discomfort
in
the
doctor
s
house
first
made
itself
clearly
apparent
to
the
beethamites
an
idea
that
alice
might
perhaps
go
very
soon
had
begun
to
prevail
in
the
village
the
eldest
son
of
the
vicar
parson
rossiter
had
come
back
from
india
as
major
rossiter
with
an
appointment
as
some
said
of
a
year
let
us
put
it
down
as
and
had
renewed
his
acquaintance
with
his
old
playfellow
others
more
than
one
or
two
had
endeavoured
before
this
to
entice
alice
to
go
away
but
it
was
said
that
the
warrior
with
his
swarthy
face
and
black
beard
and
bright
eyes
probably
too
something
in
him
nobler
than
those
outward
bearings
had
whispered
words
which
had
prevailed
it
was
supposed
that
alice
now
had
a
fitting
lover
and
that
therefore
she
would
go
there
was
no
doubt
in
the
mind
of
any
single
inhabitant
of
beetham
as
to
the
quality
of
the
lover
it
was
considered
on
all
sides
that
he
was
fitting
so
fitting
that
alice
would
of
course
go
when
asked
john
rossiter
was
such
a
man
that
every
beethamite
looked
upon
him
as
a
hero
so
that
beetham
was
proud
to
have
produced
him
in
small
communities
a
man
will
come
up
now
and
then
as
to
whom
it
is
surmised
that
any
young
lady
would
of
course
accept
him
this
man
who
was
now
about
ten
years
older
than
alice
had
everything
to
recommend
him
he
was
made
up
of
all
good
gifts
of
beauty
conduct
dignity
good
heart
and
fifteen
hundred
a
year
at
the
very
least
his
official
duties
required
him
to
live
in
london
from
which
beetham
was
seventy
miles
distant
but
those
duties
allowed
him
ample
time
for
visiting
the
parsonage
so
very
fitting
he
was
to
take
any
girl
away
upon
whom
he
might
fix
an
eye
of
approbation
that
there
were
others
higher
than
alice
in
the
world
s
standing
who
were
said
to
grudge
the
young
lady
of
the
village
so
great
a
prize
for
alice
dugdale
was
a
young
lady
of
the
village
and
no
more
whereas
there
were
county
families
around
with
daughters
among
whom
the
rossiters
had
been
in
the
habit
of
mixing
now
that
such
a
rossiter
had
come
to
the
fore
the
parsonage
family
was
held
to
be
almost
equal
to
county
people
to
whatever
extent
alice
s
love
affairs
had
gone
she
herself
had
been
very
silent
about
them
nor
had
her
lover
as
yet
taken
the
final
step
of
being
closeted
for
ten
minutes
with
her
father
nevertheless
everybody
had
been
convinced
in
beetham
that
it
would
be
so
unless
it
might
be
rossiter
rossiter
was
ambitious
for
her
son
and
in
this
matter
sympathised
with
the
county
people
the
county
people
certainly
were
of
opinion
that
john
rossiter
might
do
better
and
did
not
altogether
see
what
there
was
in
alice
dugdale
to
make
such
a
fuss
about
of
course
she
had
a
sweet
countenance
rather
brown
with
good
eyes
she
had
not
they
said
another
feature
in
her
face
which
could
be
called
handsome
her
nose
was
broad
her
mouth
was
large
they
did
not
like
that
perpetual
dimpling
of
the
cheek
which
if
natural
looked
as
if
it
were
practised
she
was
stout
almost
stumpy
they
thought
no
doubt
she
danced
well
having
a
good
ear
and
being
active
and
healthy
but
with
such
a
waist
no
girl
could
really
be
graceful
they
acknowledged
her
to
be
the
best
nursemaid
that
ever
a
mother
had
in
her
family
but
they
thought
it
a
pity
that
she
should
be
taken
away
from
duties
for
which
her
presence
was
so
much
desired
at
any
rate
by
such
a
one
as
john
rossiter
i
who
knew
beetham
well
and
who
though
turned
the
hill
of
middle
life
had
still
an
eye
for
female
charms
used
to
declare
to
myself
that
alice
though
she
was
decidedly
village
and
not
county
was
far
far
away
the
prettiest
girl
in
that
part
of
the
world
the
old
parson
loved
her
and
so
did
miss
rossiter
miss
janet
rossiter
who
was
four
or
five
years
older
than
her
brother
and
therefore
quite
an
old
maid
but
john
was
so
great
a
man
that
neither
of
them
dared
to
say
much
to
encourage
him
as
neither
did
rossiter
to
use
her
eloquence
on
the
other
side
it
was
felt
by
all
of
them
that
any
persuasion
might
have
on
john
anything
but
the
intended
effect
when
a
man
at
the
age
of
is
deputy
assistant
inspector
general
of
cavalry
it
is
not
easy
to
talk
him
this
way
or
that
in
a
matter
of
love
and
john
rossiter
though
the
best
fellow
in
the
world
was
apt
to
be
taciturn
on
such
a
subject
men
frequently
marry
almost
without
thinking
about
it
at
all
well
perhaps
i
might
as
well
at
any
rate
i
can
not
very
well
help
that
too
often
is
the
frame
of
mind
rossiter
s
discussion
to
himself
was
of
a
higher
nature
than
that
but
perhaps
not
quite
what
it
should
have
been
this
is
a
thing
of
such
moment
that
it
requires
to
be
pondered
again
and
again
a
man
has
to
think
of
himself
and
of
her
and
of
the
children
which
have
to
come
after
him
of
the
total
good
or
total
bad
which
may
come
of
such
a
as
in
the
one
manner
there
is
too
much
of
negligence
so
in
the
other
there
may
be
too
much
of
care
the
perhaps
i
might
as
wells
so
good
is
providence
are
sometimes
more
successful
than
those
careful
heroes
the
old
parson
was
very
sweet
to
alice
believing
that
she
would
be
his
and
so
was
miss
rossiter
thoroughly
approving
of
such
a
sister
but
rossiter
was
a
little
cold
all
of
which
alice
could
read
plainly
and
digest
without
saying
a
word
if
it
was
to
be
she
would
welcome
her
happy
lot
with
heartfelt
acknowledgment
of
the
happiness
provided
for
her
but
if
it
was
not
to
be
no
human
being
should
know
that
she
had
sorrowed
there
should
be
nothing
in
her
life
or
conduct
she
had
her
work
to
do
and
she
knew
that
as
long
as
she
did
that
grief
would
not
overpower
her
in
her
own
house
it
was
taken
for
granted
that
she
was
to
go
in
a
manner
that
distressed
her
you
ll
never
be
here
to
lengthen
em
said
her
stepmother
to
her
almost
whining
when
there
was
a
question
as
to
flounces
in
certain
juvenile
petticoats
which
might
require
to
be
longer
than
they
were
first
made
before
they
should
be
finally
abandoned
that
i
certainly
shall
if
tiny
grows
as
she
does
i
suppose
he
ll
pop
regularly
when
he
next
comes
down
said
dugdale
there
was
ever
so
much
in
this
which
annoyed
alice
in
the
first
place
the
word
pop
was
to
her
abominable
then
she
was
almost
called
upon
to
deny
that
he
would
pop
when
in
her
heart
she
thought
it
very
probable
that
he
might
and
the
word
she
knew
had
become
intelligible
to
the
eldest
of
her
little
sisters
who
was
present
moreover
she
was
most
unwilling
to
discuss
the
subject
at
all
and
could
hardly
leave
it
undiscussed
when
such
direct
questions
were
asked
mamma
she
said
don
t
let
us
think
about
anything
of
the
this
did
not
at
all
satisfy
herself
she
ought
to
have
repudiated
the
lover
altogether
and
yet
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
tell
the
necessary
lie
i
suppose
he
will
come
some
day
said
minnie
the
child
old
enough
to
understand
the
meaning
of
such
coming
for
men
may
come
and
men
may
go
but
i
go
on
for
ever
for
ever
said
or
sang
alice
with
a
pretence
of
drollery
as
she
turned
herself
to
her
little
sister
but
even
in
her
little
song
there
was
a
purpose
let
any
man
come
or
let
any
man
go
she
would
go
on
at
any
rate
apparently
untroubled
in
her
walk
of
life
of
course
he
ll
take
you
away
and
then
what
am
i
to
do
said
dugdale
moaning
it
is
sad
enough
for
a
girl
thus
to
have
her
lover
thrown
in
her
face
when
she
is
by
no
means
sure
of
her
lover
a
day
or
two
afterwards
another
word
much
more
painful
was
said
to
her
up
at
the
parsonage
into
the
parsonage
she
went
frequently
to
show
that
there
was
nothing
in
her
heart
to
prevent
her
visiting
her
old
friends
as
had
been
her
wont
john
will
be
down
here
next
week
said
the
parson
whom
she
met
on
the
gravel
drive
just
at
the
hall
door
how
often
he
comes
what
do
they
do
at
the
horse
guards
or
wherever
it
is
that
he
goes
to
he
ll
be
more
steady
when
he
has
taken
a
wife
said
the
old
man
in
the
meantime
what
becomes
of
the
cavalry
i
dare
say
you
ll
know
all
about
that
before
long
said
the
parson
laughing
now
my
dear
how
can
you
be
so
foolish
as
to
fill
the
girl
s
head
with
nonsense
of
that
kind
said
rossiter
who
at
that
moment
came
out
from
the
front
door
and
you
re
doing
john
an
injustice
you
are
making
people
believe
that
he
has
said
that
which
he
has
not
alice
at
the
moment
was
very
angry
as
angry
as
she
well
could
be
it
was
certain
that
rossiter
did
not
know
what
her
son
had
said
or
had
not
said
but
it
was
cruel
that
she
who
had
put
forward
no
claim
who
had
never
been
forward
in
seeking
her
lover
should
be
thus
almost
publicly
rebuked
quiet
as
she
wished
to
be
it
was
necessary
that
she
should
say
one
word
in
her
own
defence
i
don
t
think
rossiter
s
little
joke
will
do
john
any
injustice
or
me
any
harm
she
said
but
as
it
may
be
taken
seriously
i
hope
he
will
not
repeat
he
could
not
do
better
for
himself
that
s
my
opinion
said
the
old
man
turning
back
into
the
house
there
had
been
words
before
on
the
subject
between
him
and
his
wife
and
he
was
not
well
pleased
with
her
at
this
moment
my
dear
alice
i
am
sure
you
know
that
i
mean
everything
the
best
for
you
said
rossiter
if
nobody
would
mean
anything
but
just
let
me
alone
that
would
be
best
and
as
for
nonsense
rossiter
don
t
you
know
of
me
that
i
m
not
likely
to
be
carried
away
by
foolish
ideas
of
that
kind
i
do
know
that
you
are
very
then
why
should
you
talk
at
me
as
though
i
were
very
bad
rossiter
felt
that
she
had
been
reprimanded
and
was
less
inclined
than
ever
to
accept
alice
as
a
alice
as
she
walked
home
was
low
in
spirits
and
angry
with
herself
because
it
was
so
people
would
be
fools
of
course
that
was
to
be
expected
she
had
known
all
along
that
rossiter
wanted
a
grander
wife
for
her
son
whereas
the
parson
was
anxious
to
have
her
for
his
of
course
she
loved
the
parson
better
than
his
wife
but
why
was
it
that
she
felt
at
this
moment
that
rossiter
would
prevail
of
course
it
will
be
so
she
said
to
herself
i
see
it
now
and
i
suppose
he
is
right
but
then
certainly
he
ought
not
to
have
come
here
but
perhaps
he
comes
because
he
wishes
to
see
miss
she
went
a
little
out
of
her
road
home
not
only
to
dry
a
tear
but
to
rid
herself
of
the
effect
of
it
and
then
spent
the
remainder
of
the
afternoon
swinging
her
brothers
and
sisters
in
the
garden
chapter
ii
major
rossiter
perhaps
he
is
coming
here
to
see
miss
wanless
alice
had
said
to
herself
and
in
the
course
of
that
week
she
found
that
her
surmise
was
correct
john
rossiter
stayed
only
one
night
at
the
parsonage
and
then
went
over
to
brook
park
where
lived
sir
walter
wanless
and
all
the
wanlesses
the
parson
had
not
so
declared
when
he
told
alice
that
his
son
was
coming
but
john
himself
said
on
his
arrival
that
this
was
a
special
visit
made
to
brook
park
and
not
to
beetham
it
had
been
promised
for
the
last
three
months
though
only
fixed
lately
he
took
the
trouble
to
come
across
to
the
doctor
s
house
with
the
express
purpose
of
explaining
the
fact
i
suppose
you
have
always
been
intimate
with
them
said
dugdale
who
was
sitting
with
alice
and
a
little
crowd
of
the
children
round
them
there
was
a
tone
of
sarcasm
in
the
words
not
at
all
hidden
we
all
know
that
you
are
a
great
deal
finer
than
we
mere
village
folk
we
don
t
know
the
wanlesses
but
of
course
you
do
you
ll
find
yourself
much
more
at
home
at
brook
park
than
you
can
in
such
a
place
as
all
that
though
not
spoken
was
contained
in
the
tone
of
the
lady
s
speech
we
have
always
been
neighbours
said
john
rossiter
neighbours
ten
miles
off
said
mrs
dugdale
i
dare
say
the
good
samaritan
lived
thirty
miles
off
said
alice
i
don
t
think
distance
has
much
to
do
with
it
said
the
major
i
like
my
neighbours
to
be
neighbourly
i
like
beetham
neighbours
said
dugdale
there
was
a
reproach
in
every
word
of
it
dugdale
had
heard
of
miss
georgiana
wanless
and
major
rossiter
knew
that
she
had
done
so
after
her
fashion
the
lady
was
accusing
him
for
deserting
alice
alice
understood
it
also
and
yet
it
behoved
her
to
hold
herself
well
up
and
be
cheerful
i
like
beetham
people
best
myself
she
said
but
then
it
is
because
i
don
t
know
any
other
i
remember
going
to
brook
park
once
when
there
was
a
party
of
children
a
hundred
years
ago
and
i
thought
it
quite
a
paradise
there
was
a
profusion
of
strawberries
by
which
my
imagination
has
been
troubled
ever
since
you
ll
just
be
in
time
for
the
strawberries
major
he
had
always
been
john
till
quite
lately
john
with
the
memories
of
childhood
but
now
he
had
become
major
rossiter
she
went
out
into
the
garden
with
him
for
a
moment
as
he
took
his
leave
not
quite
alone
as
a
little
boy
of
two
years
old
was
clinging
to
her
hand
if
i
had
my
way
she
said
i
d
have
my
neighbours
everywhere
at
any
distance
i
envy
a
man
chiefly
for
those
one
loves
best
should
be
very
near
i
those
one
loves
best
of
all
oh
yes
so
that
one
may
do
something
it
wouldn
t
do
not
to
have
you
every
day
would
it
bobby
then
she
allowed
the
willing
little
urchin
to
struggle
up
into
her
arms
and
to
kiss
her
all
smeared
as
was
his
face
with
your
mother
meant
to
say
that
i
was
running
away
from
my
old
of
course
she
did
you
see
you
loom
so
very
large
to
us
here
you
are
such
a
swell
as
dick
says
that
we
are
a
little
sore
when
you
pass
us
by
everybody
likes
to
be
bowed
to
by
royalty
don
t
you
know
that
brook
park
is
of
course
the
proper
place
for
you
but
you
don
t
expect
but
what
we
are
going
to
express
our
little
disgusts
and
little
prides
when
we
find
ourselves
left
behind
no
words
could
have
less
declared
her
own
feelings
on
the
matter
than
those
she
was
uttering
but
she
found
herself
compelled
to
laugh
at
him
lest
in
the
other
direction
something
of
tenderness
might
escape
her
whereby
he
might
be
injured
worse
than
by
her
raillery
in
nothing
that
she
might
say
could
there
be
less
of
real
reproach
to
him
than
in
this
i
hate
that
word
swell
he
said
so
do
then
why
do
you
use
it
to
show
you
how
much
better
brook
park
is
than
beetham
i
am
sure
they
don
t
talk
about
swells
at
brook
why
do
you
throw
brook
park
in
my
teeth
i
feel
an
inclination
to
make
myself
disagreeable
are
you
never
like
that
i
hope
and
then
i
am
bound
to
follow
up
what
poor
dear
mamma
began
but
i
won
t
throw
brook
park
in
your
teeth
the
ladies
i
know
are
very
nice
sir
walter
wanless
is
a
little
grand
isn
t
he
you
know
said
he
that
i
should
be
much
happier
here
than
because
sir
walter
is
so
grand
because
my
friends
here
are
dearer
friends
but
still
it
is
right
that
i
should
go
one
can
not
always
be
where
one
would
be
i
am
happiest
with
bobby
said
she
and
i
can
always
have
then
she
gave
him
her
hand
at
the
gate
and
he
went
down
to
the
parsonage
that
night
rossiter
was
closeted
for
awhile
with
her
son
before
they
both
went
to
bed
she
was
supposed
in
beetham
to
be
of
a
higher
order
of
intellect
of
a
higher
stamp
generally
than
her
husband
or
daughter
and
to
be
in
that
respect
nearly
on
a
par
with
her
son
she
had
not
travelled
as
he
had
done
but
she
was
of
an
ambitious
mind
and
had
thoughts
beyond
beetham
the
poor
dear
parson
cared
for
little
outside
the
bounds
of
his
parish
i
am
so
glad
you
are
going
to
stay
for
awhile
over
at
brook
park
she
said
only
for
three
in
the
intimacy
of
a
house
three
days
is
a
lifetime
of
course
i
do
not
like
to
when
this
was
said
the
major
frowned
knowing
well
that
his
mother
was
going
to
interfere
but
i
can
not
help
thinking
how
much
a
connection
with
the
wanlesses
would
do
for
i
don
t
want
anything
from
any
that
is
all
very
well
john
for
a
man
to
say
but
in
truth
we
all
depend
on
connections
one
with
another
you
are
beginning
the
i
don
t
know
about
that
to
my
eyes
you
are
of
course
you
look
i
take
all
that
as
it
no
doubt
but
still
you
must
have
it
in
your
mind
to
rise
a
man
is
assisted
very
much
by
the
kind
of
wife
he
marries
much
would
be
done
for
a
of
sir
walter
nothing
i
hope
ever
for
me
on
that
score
to
succeed
by
favour
is
but
even
to
rise
by
merit
so
much
outside
assistance
is
often
necessary
though
you
will
assuredly
deserve
all
that
you
will
ever
get
yet
you
may
be
more
likely
to
get
it
as
a
to
sir
walter
wanless
than
if
you
were
married
to
some
obscure
girl
men
who
make
the
most
of
themselves
in
the
world
do
think
of
these
things
i
am
the
last
woman
in
the
world
to
recommend
my
boy
to
look
after
money
in
the
miss
wanlesses
will
have
and
therefore
i
can
speak
the
more
freely
they
will
have
very
little
as
coming
from
such
a
family
but
he
has
great
influence
he
has
contested
the
county
five
times
and
then
where
is
there
a
handsomer
girl
than
georgiana
wanless
the
major
thought
that
he
knew
one
but
did
not
answer
the
question
and
she
is
all
that
such
a
girl
ought
to
be
her
manners
are
perfect
and
her
conduct
a
constant
performance
of
domestic
duties
is
of
course
admirable
if
it
comes
to
one
to
have
to
wash
linen
she
who
washes
her
linen
well
is
a
good
woman
but
among
mean
things
high
spirits
are
not
to
be
i
am
not
so
sure
of
it
must
be
so
how
can
the
employment
of
every
hour
in
the
day
on
menial
work
leave
time
for
the
mind
to
fill
itself
making
children
s
frocks
may
be
a
duty
but
it
must
also
be
an
you
are
speaking
of
of
course
i
am
speaking
of
i
would
wager
my
head
that
she
has
read
twice
more
in
the
last
two
years
than
georgiana
wanless
but
mother
i
am
not
disposed
to
discuss
either
the
one
young
lady
or
the
other
i
am
not
going
to
brook
park
to
look
for
a
wife
and
if
ever
i
take
one
it
will
be
simply
because
i
like
her
best
and
not
because
i
wish
to
use
her
as
a
rung
of
a
ladder
by
which
to
climb
upwards
into
the
that
all
this
and
just
this
would
be
said
to
her
rossiter
had
been
aware
but
still
she
had
thought
that
a
word
in
season
might
have
its
effect
and
it
did
have
its
effect
john
rossiter
as
he
was
driven
over
to
brook
park
on
the
following
morning
was
unconsciously
mindful
of
that
allusion
to
the
washerwoman
he
had
seen
that
alice
s
cheek
had
been
smirched
by
the
greasy
crumbs
from
her
little
brother
s
mouth
he
had
seen
that
the
tips
of
her
fingers
showed
the
mark
of
the
needle
he
had
seen
fragments
of
thread
about
her
dress
and
the
mud
even
from
the
children
s
boots
on
her
skirts
he
had
seen
this
and
had
been
aware
that
georgiana
wanless
was
free
from
all
such
soil
on
her
outward
raiment
he
liked
the
perfect
grace
of
unspotted
feminine
apparel
and
he
had
too
thought
of
the
hours
in
which
alice
might
probably
be
employed
amidst
the
multifarious
needs
of
a
nursery
and
had
argued
to
himself
much
as
his
mother
had
argued
it
was
good
and
homely
worthy
of
a
thousand
praises
but
was
it
exactly
that
which
he
wanted
in
a
wife
he
had
repudiated
with
scorn
his
mother
s
cold
worldly
doctrine
but
yet
he
had
felt
that
it
would
be
a
pleasant
thing
to
have
it
known
in
london
that
his
wife
was
the
daughter
of
sir
walter
wanless
it
was
true
that
she
was
wonderfully
handsome
a
complexion
perfectly
clear
a
nose
cut
as
out
of
marble
a
mouth
delicate
as
of
a
goddess
with
a
waist
quite
to
match
it
her
shoulders
were
white
as
alabaster
her
dress
was
at
all
times
perfect
her
fingers
were
without
mark
or
stain
there
might
perhaps
be
a
want
of
expression
but
faces
so
symmetrical
are
seldom
expressive
and
then
to
crown
all
this
he
was
justified
in
believing
that
she
was
attached
to
himself
almost
as
much
had
been
said
to
him
by
lady
wanless
herself
a
word
which
would
amount
to
as
much
coupled
as
it
was
with
an
immediate
invitation
to
brook
park
of
this
he
had
given
no
hint
to
any
human
being
but
he
had
been
at
brook
park
once
before
and
some
rumour
of
something
between
him
and
miss
georgiana
wanless
had
reached
the
people
at
beetham
had
reached
as
we
have
seen
not
only
rossiter
but
also
alice
dugdale
there
had
been
moments
up
in
london
when
his
mind
had
veered
round
towards
miss
wanless
but
there
was
one
little
trifle
which
opposed
the
action
of
his
mind
and
that
was
his
heart
he
had
begun
to
think
that
it
might
be
his
duty
to
marry
georgiana
but
the
more
he
thought
so
the
more
clearly
would
the
figure
of
alice
stand
before
him
so
that
no
veil
could
be
thrown
over
it
when
he
tried
to
summon
to
his
imagination
the
statuesque
beauty
of
the
one
girl
the
bright
eyes
of
the
other
would
look
at
him
and
the
words
from
her
speaking
mouth
would
be
in
his
ears
he
had
once
kissed
alice
immediately
on
his
return
in
the
presence
of
her
father
and
the
memory
of
the
halcyon
moment
was
always
present
to
him
when
he
thought
most
of
miss
wanless
he
did
not
think
much
of
her
kisses
how
grand
she
would
be
at
his
how
glorious
in
his
but
with
alice
how
sweet
would
it
be
to
sit
by
some
brook
side
and
listen
to
the
waters
and
now
since
he
had
been
at
beetham
from
the
nature
of
things
which
sometimes
make
events
to
come
from
exactly
contrary
causes
a
new
charm
had
been
added
to
alice
simply
by
the
little
effort
she
had
made
to
annoy
him
she
had
talked
to
him
of
swells
and
had
pretended
to
be
jealous
of
the
wanlesses
just
because
she
had
known
that
he
would
hate
to
hear
such
a
word
from
her
lips
and
that
he
would
be
vexed
by
exhibition
of
such
a
feeling
on
her
part
he
was
quite
sure
that
she
had
not
committed
these
sins
because
they
belonged
to
her
as
a
matter
of
course
nothing
could
be
more
simple
than
her
natural
language
or
her
natural
feelings
but
she
had
chosen
to
show
him
that
she
was
ready
to
run
into
little
faults
which
might
offend
him
the
reverse
of
her
ideas
came
upon
him
she
had
said
as
it
were
see
how
little
anxious
i
must
be
to
dress
myself
in
your
mirror
when
i
put
myself
in
the
same
category
with
my
poor
then
he
said
to
himself
that
he
could
see
her
as
he
was
fain
to
see
her
in
her
own
mirror
and
he
loved
her
the
better
because
she
had
dared
to
run
the
risk
of
offending
him
as
he
was
driven
up
to
the
house
at
brook
park
he
knew
that
it
was
his
destiny
to
marry
either
the
one
girl
or
the
other
and
he
was
afraid
of
himself
that
before
he
left
the
house
he
might
be
engaged
to
the
one
he
did
not
love
there
was
a
moment
in
which
he
thought
he
would
turn
round
and
go
back
major
rossiter
lady
wanless
had
said
you
know
how
glad
we
are
to
see
you
here
there
is
no
young
man
of
the
day
of
whom
sir
walter
thinks
so
then
he
had
thanked
her
but
may
i
say
a
word
in
warning
and
i
may
trust
to
your
honour
i
think
so
lady
do
not
be
much
with
that
sweet
darling
of
mine
unless
indeed
and
then
she
had
stopped
major
rossiter
though
he
was
a
major
and
had
served
some
years
in
india
blushed
up
to
his
eyebrows
and
was
unable
to
answer
a
word
but
he
knew
that
georgiana
wanless
had
been
offered
to
him
and
was
entitled
to
believe
that
the
young
lady
was
prone
to
fall
in
love
with
him
lady
wanless
had
she
been
asked
for
an
excuse
for
such
conduct
would
have
said
that
the
young
men
of
the
present
day
were
slow
in
managing
their
own
affairs
unless
a
little
help
were
given
to
them
when
the
major
was
almost
immediately
invited
to
return
to
brook
park
he
could
not
but
feel
that
if
he
were
so
to
make
his
choice
he
would
be
received
there
as
a
it
may
be
that
unless
he
intended
so
to
be
received
he
should
not
have
gone
this
he
felt
as
he
was
driven
across
the
park
and
was
almost
minded
to
return
to
beetham
chapter
iii
lady
wanless
sir
walter
wanless
was
one
of
those
great
men
who
never
do
anything
great
but
achieve
their
greatness
partly
by
their
tailors
partly
by
a
breadth
of
eyebrow
and
carriage
of
the
body
what
we
may
call
deportment
and
partly
by
the
outside
gifts
of
fortune
taking
his
career
altogether
we
must
say
that
he
had
been
unfortunate
he
was
a
baronet
with
a
fine
house
and
park
and
with
an
income
hardly
sufficient
for
the
place
he
had
contested
the
county
four
times
on
old
whig
principles
and
had
once
been
in
parliament
for
two
years
there
he
had
never
opened
his
mouth
but
in
his
struggle
to
get
there
had
greatly
embarrassed
his
finances
his
tailor
had
been
well
chosen
and
had
always
turned
him
out
as
the
best
dressed
old
baronet
in
england
his
eyebrow
was
all
his
own
and
certainly
commanded
respect
from
those
with
whom
eyebrows
are
efficacious
he
never
read
he
eschewed
farming
by
which
he
had
lost
money
in
early
life
and
had
so
to
say
no
visible
occupation
at
all
but
he
was
sir
walter
wanless
and
what
with
his
tailor
and
what
with
his
eyebrow
he
did
command
a
great
deal
of
respect
in
the
country
round
beetham
he
had
too
certain
good
gifts
for
which
people
were
thankful
as
coming
from
so
great
a
man
he
paid
his
bills
he
went
to
church
he
was
well
behaved
and
still
maintained
certain
family
charities
though
money
was
not
plentiful
with
him
he
had
two
sons
and
five
daughters
the
sons
were
in
the
army
and
were
beyond
his
control
the
daughters
were
all
at
home
and
were
altogether
under
the
control
of
their
mother
indeed
everything
at
brook
park
was
under
the
control
of
lady
wanless
though
no
man
alive
gave
himself
airs
more
autocratic
than
sir
walter
it
was
on
her
shoulders
that
fell
the
burden
of
the
five
daughters
and
of
maintaining
with
straitened
means
the
hospitality
of
brook
park
on
their
behoof
a
woman
was
lady
wanless
in
doing
her
duty
with
imperfect
lights
no
doubt
but
to
the
best
of
her
abilities
with
such
lights
as
she
possessed
she
was
somewhat
fine
in
her
dress
not
for
any
comfort
that
might
accrue
to
herself
but
from
a
feeling
that
an
alliance
with
the
wanlesses
would
not
be
valued
by
the
proper
sort
of
young
men
unless
she
were
grand
herself
the
girls
were
beautifully
dressed
but
oh
with
such
care
and
economy
and
daily
labour
among
them
herself
and
the
two
lady
upstairs
the
father
what
with
his
election
and
his
farming
and
a
period
of
costly
living
early
in
his
life
had
not
done
well
for
the
family
that
she
knew
and
never
rebuked
him
but
it
was
for
her
to
set
matters
right
which
she
could
only
do
by
getting
husbands
for
the
daughters
that
this
might
be
achieved
the
wanless
prestige
must
be
maintained
and
with
crippled
means
it
is
so
hard
to
maintain
a
family
prestige
a
poor
duke
may
do
it
or
perhaps
an
earl
but
a
baronet
is
not
high
enough
to
give
bad
wines
to
his
guests
without
serious
detriment
to
his
unmarried
daughters
a
beginning
to
what
might
be
hoped
to
be
a
long
line
of
successes
had
already
been
made
the
eldest
girl
sophia
was
engaged
lady
wanless
did
not
look
very
high
knowing
that
failure
in
such
operations
will
bring
with
it
such
unutterable
misfortune
sophia
was
engaged
to
the
eldest
son
of
a
neighbouring
squire
whose
property
indeed
was
not
large
nor
was
the
squire
likely
to
die
very
soon
but
there
were
the
means
of
present
living
and
a
future
rental
of
a
year
young
cobble
was
now
staying
at
the
house
and
had
been
duly
accepted
by
sir
walter
himself
the
youngest
girl
who
was
only
nineteen
had
fallen
in
love
with
a
young
clergyman
in
the
neighbourhood
that
would
not
do
at
all
and
the
young
clergyman
was
not
allowed
within
the
park
georgiana
was
the
beauty
and
for
her
if
for
any
some
great
destiny
might
have
been
hoped
but
it
was
her
turn
a
matter
of
which
lady
wanless
thought
a
great
deal
and
the
major
was
too
good
to
be
allowed
to
escape
georgiana
in
her
cold
impassive
way
seemed
to
like
the
major
and
therefore
lady
wanless
paired
them
off
instantly
with
that
decision
which
was
necessary
amidst
the
labours
of
her
life
she
had
no
scruples
in
what
she
did
feeling
sure
that
her
daughters
would
make
honest
good
wives
and
that
the
blood
of
the
wanlesses
was
a
dowry
in
itself
the
major
had
been
told
to
come
early
because
a
party
was
made
to
visit
certain
ruins
about
eight
miles
off
castle
owless
as
it
was
called
to
which
lady
wanless
was
accustomed
to
take
her
guests
because
the
family
history
declared
that
the
wanlesses
had
lived
there
at
some
very
remote
period
it
still
belonged
to
sir
walter
though
unfortunately
the
intervening
lands
had
for
the
most
part
fallen
into
other
hands
owless
and
wanless
were
supposed
to
be
the
same
and
thus
there
was
room
for
a
good
deal
of
family
tattle
i
am
delighted
to
see
you
at
brook
park
said
sir
walter
as
they
met
at
the
luncheon
table
when
i
was
at
christchurch
your
father
was
at
wadham
and
i
remember
him
exactly
the
same
words
had
been
spoken
when
the
major
on
a
former
occasion
had
been
made
welcome
at
the
house
and
clearly
implied
a
feeling
that
christchurch
though
much
superior
may
condescend
to
know
wadham
under
certain
circumstances
of
the
baronet
nothing
further
was
heard
or
seen
till
dinner
lady
wanless
went
in
the
open
carriage
with
three
daughters
sophie
being
one
of
them
as
her
affair
was
settled
it
was
not
necessary
that
one
of
the
two
should
be
allotted
to
her
use
young
cobble
who
had
been
asked
to
send
two
horses
over
from
cobble
hall
so
that
rossiter
might
ride
one
felt
this
very
hard
but
there
was
no
appeal
from
lady
wanless
you
ll
have
plenty
enough
of
her
all
the
evening
said
the
mother
patting
him
affectionately
and
it
is
so
necessary
just
at
present
that
georgiana
and
edith
should
have
horse
in
this
way
it
was
arranged
that
georgiana
should
ride
with
the
major
and
edith
the
third
daughter
with
young
burmeston
the
son
of
cox
and
burmeston
brewers
at
the
neighbouring
town
of
slowbridge
a
country
brewer
is
not
quite
what
lady
wanless
would
have
liked
but
with
difficulties
such
as
hers
a
rich
young
brewer
might
be
worth
having
all
this
was
hard
upon
cobble
who
would
not
have
sent
his
horses
over
had
he
known
it
our
major
saw
at
a
glance
that
georgiana
rode
well
he
liked
ladies
to
ride
and
doubted
whether
alice
had
ever
been
on
horseback
in
her
life
after
all
how
many
advantages
does
a
girl
lose
by
having
to
pass
her
days
in
a
nursery
for
a
moment
some
such
idea
crossed
his
mind
then
he
asked
georgiana
some
question
as
to
the
scenery
through
which
they
were
passing
very
fine
indeed
said
georgiana
she
looked
square
before
her
and
sat
with
her
back
square
to
the
horse
s
tail
there
was
no
hanging
in
the
saddle
no
shifting
about
in
uneasiness
she
could
rise
and
fall
easily
even
gracefully
when
the
horse
trotted
you
are
fond
of
riding
i
can
see
said
the
major
i
do
like
riding
answered
georgiana
the
tone
in
which
she
spoke
of
her
present
occupation
was
much
more
lively
than
that
in
which
she
had
expressed
her
approbation
of
scenery
at
the
ruin
they
all
got
down
and
lady
wanless
told
them
the
entire
story
of
the
owlesses
and
the
wanlesses
and
filled
the
brewer
s
mind
with
wonder
as
to
the
antiquity
and
dignity
of
the
family
but
the
major
was
the
fish
just
at
this
moment
in
hand
the
rossiters
are
very
old
too
she
said
smiling
but
perhaps
that
is
a
kind
of
thing
you
don
t
care
very
much
indeed
said
he
which
was
true
for
he
was
proud
of
knowing
that
he
had
come
from
the
rossiters
who
had
been
over
four
hundred
years
in
herefordshire
a
remembrance
of
old
merit
will
always
be
an
incitement
to
it
is
just
that
major
rossiter
it
is
strange
how
very
nearly
in
the
same
words
georgiana
said
the
same
thing
to
me
georgiana
happened
to
overhear
this
but
did
not
contradict
her
mother
though
she
made
a
grimace
to
her
sister
which
was
seen
by
no
one
else
then
lady
wanless
slipped
aside
to
assist
the
brewer
and
edith
leaving
the
major
and
her
second
daughter
together
the
two
younger
girls
of
whom
the
youngest
was
the
wicked
one
with
the
penchant
for
the
curate
were
wandering
among
the
ruins
by
themselves
i
wonder
whether
there
ever
were
any
people
called
owless
said
rossiter
not
quite
knowing
what
subject
of
conversation
to
choose
of
course
there
were
mamma
always
says
that
settles
the
question
does
it
not
i
don
t
see
why
there
shouldn
t
be
owlesses
no
i
won
t
sit
on
the
wall
thank
you
because
i
should
stain
my
but
you
ll
be
not
particularly
tired
it
is
not
so
very
far
i
d
go
back
in
the
carriage
only
of
course
we
can
t
because
of
the
habits
oh
yes
i
m
very
fond
of
dancing
very
fond
indeed
we
always
have
two
balls
every
year
at
slowbridge
and
there
are
some
others
about
the
county
i
don
t
think
you
ever
have
balls
at
there
is
no
one
to
give
does
miss
dugdale
ever
dance
the
major
had
to
think
for
a
moment
before
he
could
answer
the
question
why
should
miss
wanless
ask
as
to
alice
s
dancing
i
am
sure
she
does
now
i
think
of
it
i
have
heard
her
talk
of
dancing
you
don
t
know
alice
dugdale
miss
wanless
shook
her
head
she
is
worth
i
am
quite
sure
she
is
i
have
always
heard
that
you
thought
so
she
is
very
good
to
all
those
children
isn
t
she
very
good
she
would
be
almost
pretty
if
she
wasn
t
so
so
so
dumpy
i
should
then
they
got
on
their
horses
again
and
rode
back
to
brook
park
let
georgiana
be
ever
so
tired
she
did
not
show
it
but
rode
in
under
the
portico
with
perfect
equestrian
grace
i
m
afraid
you
took
too
much
out
of
her
said
lady
wanless
to
the
major
that
evening
georgiana
had
gone
to
bed
a
little
earlier
than
the
others
this
was
in
some
degree
hard
upon
him
as
he
had
not
proposed
the
ride
and
he
excused
himself
it
was
you
arranged
it
all
lady
yes
indeed
said
she
smiling
i
did
arrange
the
little
excursion
but
it
was
not
i
who
kept
her
talking
the
whole
now
this
again
was
felt
to
be
unfair
as
nearly
every
word
of
conversation
between
the
young
people
has
been
given
in
this
little
chronicle
on
the
following
day
the
young
people
were
again
thrust
together
and
before
they
parted
for
the
night
another
little
word
was
spoken
by
lady
wanless
which
indicated
very
clearly
that
there
was
some
special
bond
of
friendship
between
the
major
and
her
second
daughter
you
are
quite
right
she
had
said
in
answer
to
some
extracted
compliment
she
does
ride
very
well
when
i
was
up
in
town
in
may
i
thought
i
saw
no
one
with
such
a
seat
in
the
row
miss
green
who
taught
the
duchess
of
ditchwater
s
daughters
declared
that
she
knew
nothing
like
on
the
third
morning
he
returned
to
beetham
early
as
he
intended
to
go
up
to
town
the
same
afternoon
then
there
was
prepared
for
him
a
little
valedictory
opportunity
in
which
he
could
not
but
press
the
young
lady
s
fingers
for
a
moment
as
he
did
so
no
one
was
looking
at
him
but
then
he
knew
that
it
was
so
much
the
more
dangerous
because
no
one
was
looking
nothing
could
be
more
knowing
than
the
conduct
of
the
young
lady
who
was
not
in
any
way
too
forward
if
she
admitted
that
slight
pressure
it
was
done
with
a
retiring
rather
than
obtrusive
favour
it
was
not
by
her
own
doing
that
she
was
alone
with
him
for
a
moment
there
was
no
casting
down
or
casting
up
of
her
eyes
and
yet
it
seemed
to
him
as
he
left
her
and
went
out
into
the
hall
that
there
had
been
so
much
between
them
that
he
was
almost
bound
to
propose
to
her
in
the
hall
there
was
the
baronet
to
bid
him
farewell
an
honour
which
he
did
to
his
guests
only
when
he
was
minded
to
treat
them
with
great
distinction
lady
wanless
and
i
are
delighted
to
have
had
you
here
he
said
remember
me
to
your
father
and
tell
him
that
i
remember
him
very
well
when
i
was
at
christchurch
and
he
was
at
it
was
something
to
have
had
one
s
hand
taken
in
so
paternal
a
manner
by
a
baronet
with
such
an
eyebrow
and
such
a
coat
and
yet
when
he
returned
to
beetham
he
was
not
in
a
with
himself
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
been
almost
absorbed
among
the
wanlesses
without
any
action
or
will
of
his
own
he
tried
to
comfort
himself
by
declaring
that
georgiana
was
without
doubt
a
remarkably
handsome
young
woman
and
that
she
was
a
perfect
horsewoman
as
though
all
that
were
a
matter
to
him
of
any
moment
then
he
went
across
to
the
doctor
s
house
to
say
a
word
of
farewell
to
alice
have
you
had
a
pleasant
visit
she
asked
oh
yes
all
very
that
second
miss
wanless
is
quite
beautiful
is
she
not
she
is
handsome
i
call
her
lovely
said
alice
you
rode
with
her
the
other
day
over
to
that
old
who
could
have
told
this
of
him
already
yes
there
was
a
party
of
us
went
when
are
you
going
there
again
now
something
had
been
said
of
a
further
visit
and
rossiter
had
almost
promised
that
he
would
return
it
is
impossible
not
to
promise
when
undefined
invitations
are
given
a
man
can
not
declare
that
he
is
engaged
for
ever
and
ever
but
how
was
it
that
alice
knew
all
that
had
been
said
and
done
i
can
not
say
that
i
have
fixed
any
exact
day
he
replied
almost
angrily
i
ve
heard
all
about
you
you
know
that
young
burmeston
was
at
tweed
s
and
told
them
what
a
favourite
you
are
if
it
be
true
i
will
congratulate
you
because
i
do
really
think
that
the
young
lady
is
the
most
beautiful
that
i
ever
saw
in
my
this
she
said
with
a
smile
and
a
little
shake
of
the
head
if
it
was
to
be
that
her
heart
must
be
broken
he
at
least
should
not
know
it
and
she
still
hoped
she
still
thought
that
by
being
very
constant
at
her
work
she
might
get
over
it
chapter
iv
the
beethamites
it
was
told
all
through
beetham
before
a
week
was
over
that
major
rossiter
was
to
marry
the
second
miss
wanless
and
beetham
liked
the
news
beetham
was
proud
that
one
of
her
sons
should
be
introduced
into
the
great
neighbouring
family
and
especially
that
he
should
be
honoured
by
the
hand
of
the
acknowledged
beauty
beetham
a
month
ago
had
declared
that
alice
dugdale
a
beethamite
herself
from
her
babyhood
who
had
been
born
and
bred
at
beetham
and
had
ever
lived
there
was
to
be
honoured
by
the
hand
of
the
young
hero
but
it
may
be
doubted
whether
beetham
had
been
altogether
satisfied
with
the
arrangement
we
are
apt
to
envy
the
good
luck
of
those
who
have
always
been
familiar
with
us
why
should
it
have
been
alice
dugdale
any
more
than
one
of
the
tweed
girls
or
miss
simkins
the
daughter
of
the
attorney
who
would
certainly
have
a
snug
little
fortune
of
her
own
which
unfortunately
would
not
be
the
case
with
alice
dugdale
it
had
been
felt
that
alice
was
hardly
good
enough
for
their
hero
alice
who
had
been
seen
about
with
all
the
dugdale
children
pushing
them
in
perambulators
almost
every
day
since
the
eldest
was
born
we
prefer
the
authority
of
a
stranger
to
that
of
one
chosen
from
among
ourselves
as
the
two
miss
tweeds
and
miss
simkins
with
alice
and
three
or
four
others
could
not
divide
the
hero
among
them
it
was
better
then
that
the
hero
should
go
from
among
them
and
choose
a
fitting
mate
in
a
higher
realm
they
all
felt
the
greatness
of
the
wanlesses
and
argued
with
rossiter
that
the
rising
star
of
the
village
should
obtain
such
assistance
in
rising
as
would
come
to
him
from
an
almost
noble
marriage
there
had
been
certainly
a
decided
opinion
that
alice
was
to
be
the
happy
woman
dugdale
the
stepmother
had
boasted
of
the
promotion
and
old
rossiter
had
whispered
his
secret
conviction
into
the
ear
of
every
favoured
parishioner
the
doctor
himself
had
allowed
his
patients
to
ask
questions
about
it
this
had
become
so
common
that
alice
herself
had
been
inwardly
indignant
would
have
been
outwardly
indignant
but
that
she
could
not
allow
herself
to
discuss
the
matter
that
having
been
so
beetham
ought
to
have
been
scandalised
by
the
fickleness
of
her
hero
beetham
ought
to
have
felt
that
her
hero
was
most
unheroic
but
at
any
rate
among
the
ladies
there
was
no
shadow
of
such
a
feeling
of
course
such
a
man
as
the
major
was
bound
to
do
the
best
for
himself
the
giving
away
of
his
hand
in
marriage
was
a
very
serious
thing
and
was
not
to
be
obligatory
on
a
young
hero
because
he
had
been
carried
away
by
the
fervour
of
old
friendship
to
kiss
a
young
lady
immediately
on
his
return
home
the
history
of
the
kiss
was
known
all
over
beetham
and
was
declared
by
competent
authorities
to
have
amounted
to
nothing
it
was
a
last
lingering
touch
of
childhood
s
happy
embracings
and
if
alice
was
such
a
fool
as
to
take
it
for
more
she
must
pay
the
penalty
of
her
folly
it
was
in
her
father
s
presence
said
rossiter
defending
her
son
to
tweed
and
tweed
had
expressed
her
opinion
that
the
kiss
ought
to
go
for
nothing
the
major
was
to
be
acquitted
and
the
fact
of
the
acquittal
made
its
way
even
to
the
doctor
s
nursery
so
that
alice
knew
that
the
man
might
marry
that
girl
at
brook
park
with
clean
hands
that
as
she
declared
to
herself
did
not
increase
her
sorrow
if
the
man
were
minded
to
marry
the
girl
he
was
welcome
for
her
and
she
apologised
for
him
to
her
own
heart
what
a
man
generally
wants
she
said
is
a
beautiful
wife
and
of
the
beauty
of
miss
georgiana
wanless
there
could
be
no
doubt
only
only
only
there
had
been
a
dozen
words
which
he
should
have
left
unspoken
that
which
riveted
the
news
on
the
minds
of
the
beethamites
was
the
stopping
of
the
brook
park
carriage
at
the
door
of
the
parsonage
one
day
about
a
week
after
the
major
s
visit
it
was
not
altogether
an
unprecedented
occurrence
had
there
been
no
precedent
it
could
hardly
have
been
justified
on
the
present
occasion
perhaps
once
in
two
years
lady
wanless
would
call
at
the
parsonage
and
then
there
would
be
a
return
visit
during
which
a
reference
would
always
be
made
to
wadham
and
christchurch
the
visit
was
now
out
of
its
order
only
nine
months
having
elapsed
of
which
irregularity
beetham
took
due
notice
on
this
occasion
miss
wanless
and
the
third
young
lady
accompanied
their
mother
leaving
georgiana
at
home
what
was
whispered
between
the
two
old
ladies
beetham
did
not
quite
know
but
made
its
surmises
it
was
in
this
wise
we
were
so
glad
to
have
the
major
over
with
us
said
her
ladyship
it
was
so
good
of
you
said
rossiter
he
is
a
great
favourite
with
sir
that
is
so
good
of
sir
and
we
are
quite
pleased
to
have
him
among
our
young
that
was
all
but
it
was
quite
sufficient
to
tell
rossiter
that
john
might
have
georgiana
wanless
for
the
asking
and
that
lady
wanless
expected
him
to
ask
then
the
parting
was
much
more
affectionate
than
it
had
ever
been
before
and
there
was
a
squeezing
of
the
hand
and
a
nodding
of
the
head
which
meant
a
great
deal
alice
held
her
tongue
and
did
her
work
and
attempted
to
be
cheery
through
it
all
again
and
again
she
asked
herself
what
did
it
matter
even
though
she
were
unhappy
even
though
she
felt
a
keen
palpable
perpetual
aching
at
her
heart
what
would
it
matter
so
long
as
she
could
go
about
and
do
her
business
some
people
in
this
world
had
to
be
unhappy
perhaps
most
people
and
this
was
a
sorrow
which
though
it
might
not
wear
off
would
by
wearing
become
dull
enough
to
be
bearable
she
distressed
herself
in
that
there
was
any
sorrow
providence
had
given
to
her
a
certain
condition
of
life
to
which
many
charms
were
attached
she
thoroughly
loved
the
people
about
her
her
father
her
little
brothers
and
sisters
even
her
overworn
and
somewhat
idle
stepmother
she
was
a
queen
in
the
house
a
queen
among
her
busy
toils
and
she
liked
being
a
queen
and
liked
being
busy
no
one
ever
scolded
her
or
crossed
her
or
contradicted
her
she
had
the
essential
satisfaction
of
the
consciousness
of
usefulness
why
should
not
that
suffice
to
her
she
despised
herself
because
there
was
a
hole
in
her
heart
because
she
felt
herself
to
shrink
all
over
when
the
name
of
georgiana
wanless
was
mentioned
in
her
hearing
yet
she
would
mention
the
name
herself
and
speak
with
something
akin
to
admiration
of
the
wanless
family
and
she
would
say
how
well
it
was
that
men
should
strive
to
rise
in
the
world
and
how
that
the
world
progressed
through
such
individual
efforts
but
she
would
not
mention
the
name
of
john
rossiter
nor
would
she
endure
that
it
should
be
mentioned
in
her
hearing
with
any
special
reference
to
herself
dugdale
though
she
was
overworn
and
idle
a
warped
and
almost
useless
piece
of
furniture
made
as
was
said
before
of
bad
timber
yet
saw
more
of
this
than
anyone
else
and
was
indignant
to
lose
alice
to
have
no
one
to
let
down
those
tucks
and
take
up
those
stitches
would
be
to
her
the
loss
of
all
her
comforts
but
though
she
was
feckless
she
was
and
she
knew
that
alice
was
being
wronged
it
was
alice
that
had
a
right
to
the
hero
and
not
that
young
woman
at
brook
park
it
was
thus
she
spoke
of
the
affair
to
the
doctor
and
after
awhile
found
herself
unable
to
be
silent
on
the
subject
to
alice
herself
if
what
they
say
does
take
place
i
shall
think
worse
of
john
rossiter
than
i
ever
did
of
any
man
i
ever
this
she
said
in
the
presence
both
of
her
husband
and
her
john
rossiter
will
not
be
very
much
the
worse
for
that
said
alice
without
relaxing
a
moment
from
her
work
there
was
a
sound
of
drolling
in
her
voice
as
though
she
were
quizzing
her
stepmother
for
her
folly
it
seems
to
me
that
men
may
do
anything
now
continued
dugdale
i
suppose
they
are
the
same
now
as
they
always
were
said
the
doctor
if
a
man
chose
to
be
false
he
could
always
be
i
call
it
unmanly
said
dugdale
if
i
were
a
man
i
would
beat
what
would
you
beat
him
for
said
alice
getting
up
and
as
she
did
so
throwing
down
on
the
table
before
her
the
little
frock
she
was
making
if
you
had
the
power
of
beating
him
why
would
you
beat
him
because
he
is
how
do
you
know
that
did
i
ever
tell
you
so
have
you
ever
heard
a
word
that
he
has
said
to
me
either
direct
from
himself
or
that
justifies
you
in
saying
that
he
has
me
you
me
when
you
speak
like
alice
do
not
be
so
violent
said
the
doctor
father
i
will
speak
of
this
once
and
once
for
all
and
then
pray
pray
let
there
be
no
further
mention
of
it
i
have
no
right
to
complain
of
anything
in
major
rossiter
he
has
done
me
no
wrong
those
who
love
me
should
not
mention
his
name
in
reference
to
he
is
a
villain
said
dugdale
he
is
no
villain
he
is
a
gentleman
as
far
as
i
know
from
the
crown
of
his
head
to
the
sole
of
his
foot
does
it
ever
occur
to
you
how
little
you
make
of
me
when
you
talk
of
him
in
this
way
dismiss
it
all
from
your
mind
father
and
let
things
be
as
they
were
do
you
think
that
i
am
pining
for
any
man
s
love
i
say
that
major
rossiter
is
a
true
man
and
a
gentleman
but
i
would
not
give
my
bobby
s
little
finger
for
all
his
whole
then
there
was
silence
and
afterwards
the
doctor
told
his
wife
that
the
major
s
name
had
better
not
be
mentioned
again
among
them
alice
on
this
occasion
was
or
appeared
to
be
very
angry
with
dugdale
but
on
that
evening
and
the
next
morning
there
was
an
accession
of
tenderness
in
her
usually
sweet
manner
to
her
stepmother
the
expression
of
her
mother
s
anger
against
the
major
had
been
wrong
but
the
feeling
of
anger
was
not
the
less
endearing
some
time
after
that
one
evening
the
parson
came
upon
alice
as
she
was
picking
flowers
in
one
of
the
beetham
lanes
she
had
all
the
children
with
her
and
was
filling
minnie
s
apron
with
roses
from
the
hedge
old
rossiter
stopped
and
talked
to
them
and
after
awhile
succeeded
in
getting
alice
to
walk
on
with
him
you
haven
t
heard
from
john
he
said
oh
no
replied
alice
almost
with
a
start
and
then
she
added
quickly
there
is
no
one
at
our
house
likely
to
hear
from
him
he
does
not
write
to
anyone
i
did
not
know
whether
any
message
might
have
reached
i
think
he
is
to
be
here
again
before
long
said
the
parson
oh
she
had
but
a
moment
to
think
of
it
all
but
after
thinking
she
continued
i
suppose
he
will
be
going
over
to
brook
i
fear
he
fear
why
should
you
fear
rossiter
if
that
is
true
it
is
the
place
where
he
ought
to
but
i
doubt
its
truth
my
ah
i
know
nothing
about
that
if
so
he
had
better
stay
up
in
london
i
i
don
t
think
john
can
care
much
for
miss
why
not
she
is
the
most
thoroughly
beautiful
young
woman
i
ever
i
don
t
think
he
does
because
i
believe
his
heart
is
elsewhere
alice
you
have
his
i
think
so
no
rossiter
i
have
not
it
is
not
so
i
know
nothing
of
miss
wanless
but
i
can
speak
of
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
speaking
of
him
then
why
does
he
go
there
that
is
just
what
i
can
not
answer
why
does
he
go
there
why
do
we
do
the
worst
thing
so
often
when
we
see
the
better
but
we
don
t
leave
undone
the
thing
which
we
wish
to
do
that
is
just
what
we
do
do
under
constraint
alice
i
hope
i
hope
that
you
may
become
his
she
endeavoured
to
deny
that
it
could
ever
be
so
she
strove
to
declare
that
she
herself
was
much
too
for
that
but
the
words
would
not
come
to
her
lips
and
she
could
only
sob
while
she
struggled
to
retain
her
tears
if
he
does
come
to
you
give
him
a
chance
again
even
though
he
may
have
been
untrue
to
you
for
a
then
she
was
left
alone
among
the
children
she
could
dry
her
tears
and
suppress
her
sobs
because
minnie
was
old
enough
to
know
the
meaning
of
them
if
she
saw
them
but
she
could
not
for
awhile
go
back
into
the
house
she
left
them
in
the
passage
and
then
went
out
again
and
walked
up
and
down
a
little
pathway
that
ran
through
the
shrubs
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
i
believe
his
heart
is
could
it
be
that
it
was
so
and
if
so
of
what
nature
can
be
a
man
s
love
if
when
it
be
given
in
one
direction
he
can
go
in
another
with
his
hand
she
could
understand
that
there
had
not
been
much
heart
in
it
that
he
being
a
man
and
not
a
woman
could
have
made
this
turning
point
of
his
life
an
affair
of
calculation
and
had
taken
himself
here
or
there
without
much
love
at
all
that
as
he
would
seek
a
commodious
house
so
would
he
also
a
convenient
wife
resting
on
that
suggestion
to
herself
she
had
dared
to
declare
to
her
father
and
mother
that
major
rossiter
was
not
a
villain
but
a
perfect
gentleman
but
all
that
was
not
compatible
with
his
father
s
story
alice
you
have
his
heart
the
old
man
had
said
how
had
it
come
to
pass
that
the
old
man
had
known
it
and
yet
the
assurance
was
so
sweet
so
heavenly
so
laden
to
her
ears
with
divine
music
that
at
this
moment
she
would
not
even
ask
herself
to
disbelieve
it
if
he
does
come
to
you
give
him
a
chance
why
yes
though
she
never
spoke
a
word
of
miss
wanless
without
praise
though
she
had
tutored
herself
to
swear
that
miss
wanless
was
the
very
wife
for
him
yet
she
knew
herself
too
well
not
to
know
that
she
was
better
than
miss
wanless
for
his
sake
she
could
with
a
clear
conscience
give
him
a
chance
again
the
dear
old
parson
he
had
seen
it
all
he
had
known
he
had
appreciated
if
it
should
ever
come
to
pass
that
she
was
to
be
his
he
should
have
his
reward
she
would
not
tell
herself
that
she
expected
him
to
come
again
but
if
he
did
come
she
would
give
the
parson
his
chance
such
was
her
idea
at
that
moment
but
she
was
forced
to
change
it
before
long
chapter
the
invitation
when
major
rossiter
discussed
his
own
conduct
with
himself
as
men
are
so
often
compelled
to
do
by
their
own
conscience
in
opposition
to
their
own
wishes
he
was
not
well
pleased
with
himself
on
his
return
home
from
india
he
had
found
himself
possessed
of
a
liberal
income
and
had
begun
to
enjoy
himself
without
thinking
much
about
marrying
it
is
not
often
that
a
man
looks
for
a
wife
because
he
has
made
up
his
mind
that
he
wants
the
article
he
roams
about
unshackled
till
something
which
at
the
time
seems
to
be
altogether
desirable
presents
itself
to
him
and
then
he
meditates
marriage
so
it
had
been
with
our
major
alice
had
presented
herself
to
him
as
something
altogether
desirable
a
something
which
when
it
was
touched
and
looked
at
seemed
to
be
so
full
of
sweetnesses
that
to
him
it
was
for
the
moment
of
all
things
the
most
charming
he
was
not
a
forward
man
one
of
those
who
can
see
a
girl
for
the
first
time
on
a
monday
and
propose
to
her
on
the
tuesday
when
the
idea
first
suggested
itself
to
him
of
making
alice
his
wife
he
became
reticent
and
undemonstrative
the
kiss
had
in
truth
meant
no
more
than
tweed
had
said
when
he
began
to
feel
that
he
loved
her
then
he
hardly
dared
to
dream
of
kissing
her
but
though
he
felt
that
he
loved
her
liked
perhaps
it
would
be
fairer
to
say
in
that
early
stage
of
his
feelings
better
than
any
other
woman
yet
when
he
came
to
think
of
marriage
the
importance
of
it
all
made
him
hesitate
and
he
was
reminded
by
little
hints
from
others
and
by
words
plain
enough
from
one
person
that
alice
dugdale
was
after
all
a
common
thing
there
is
a
fitness
in
such
matters
so
said
rossiter
and
a
propriety
in
like
being
married
to
like
had
it
been
his
lot
to
be
a
village
doctor
alice
would
have
suited
him
well
destiny
however
had
carried
him
the
major
higher
up
and
would
require
him
to
live
in
london
among
ornate
people
with
polished
habits
and
peculiar
manners
of
their
own
would
not
alice
be
out
of
her
element
in
london
see
the
things
among
which
she
passed
her
life
not
a
morsel
of
soap
or
a
pound
of
sugar
was
used
in
the
house
but
what
she
gave
it
out
her
hours
were
passed
in
washing
teaching
and
sewing
for
the
children
in
her
very
walks
she
was
always
pushing
a
perambulator
she
was
no
doubt
the
doctor
s
daughter
but
in
fact
she
was
the
second
dugdale
s
nursemaid
nothing
could
be
more
praiseworthy
but
there
is
a
fitness
in
things
and
he
the
hero
of
beetham
the
assistant
deputy
of
the
british
cavalry
might
surely
do
better
than
marry
a
praiseworthy
nursery
girl
it
was
thus
that
rossiter
argued
with
her
son
and
her
arguments
were
not
without
avail
then
georgiana
wanless
had
been
as
it
were
thrown
at
his
head
when
one
is
pelted
with
one
can
hardly
resent
the
attack
he
was
clever
enough
to
feel
that
he
was
pelted
but
at
first
he
liked
the
sweetmeats
a
girl
riding
on
horseback
with
her
back
square
to
the
horse
s
tail
with
her
reins
well
held
and
a
hat
on
her
head
is
an
object
unfortunately
more
attractive
to
the
eyes
of
ordinary
men
than
a
young
woman
pushing
a
perambulator
with
two
babies
unfortunately
i
say
because
in
either
case
the
young
woman
should
be
judged
by
her
personal
merits
and
not
by
externals
but
the
major
declared
to
himself
that
the
personal
merits
would
be
affected
by
the
externals
a
girl
who
had
pushed
a
perambulator
for
many
years
would
hardly
have
a
soul
above
perambulators
there
would
be
wanting
the
flavour
of
the
aroma
of
romance
that
something
of
poetic
vagueness
without
which
a
girl
can
hardly
be
altogether
charming
to
the
senses
of
an
appreciative
lover
then
a
little
later
on
he
asked
himself
whether
georgiana
wanless
was
romantic
and
poetic
whether
there
was
much
of
true
aroma
there
but
yet
he
thought
that
fate
would
require
him
to
marry
georgiana
wanless
whom
he
certainly
did
not
love
and
to
leave
alice
to
her
perambulator
alice
whom
he
certainly
did
love
and
as
he
thought
of
this
he
was
ill
at
ease
with
himself
it
might
be
well
that
he
should
give
up
his
assistant
deputy
go
back
to
india
and
so
get
rid
of
his
two
troubles
together
fate
as
he
personified
fate
to
himself
in
this
matter
took
the
form
of
lady
wanless
it
made
him
sad
to
think
that
he
was
but
a
weak
creature
in
the
hands
of
an
old
woman
who
wanted
to
use
him
for
a
certain
purpose
but
he
did
not
see
his
way
of
escaping
when
he
began
to
console
himself
by
reflecting
that
he
would
have
one
of
the
handsomest
women
in
london
at
his
he
knew
that
he
would
be
unable
to
escape
about
the
middle
of
july
he
received
the
following
letter
from
lady
wanless
dear
major
rossiter
the
girls
have
been
at
their
father
for
the
last
ten
days
to
have
an
archery
meeting
on
the
lawn
and
have
at
last
prevailed
though
sir
walter
has
all
a
father
s
abhorrence
to
have
the
lawn
knocked
about
now
it
is
settled
i
ll
see
about
it
sir
walter
said
at
last
and
when
so
much
as
that
had
been
obtained
they
all
knew
that
the
archery
meeting
was
to
be
sir
walter
likes
his
own
way
and
is
not
always
to
be
persuaded
but
when
he
has
made
the
slightest
show
of
concession
he
never
goes
back
from
it
then
comes
the
question
as
to
the
day
which
is
now
in
course
of
discussion
in
full
committee
in
that
matter
sir
walter
is
supposed
to
be
excluded
from
any
voice
it
can
not
matter
to
him
what
day
of
the
week
or
what
day
of
the
month
said
georgiana
very
irreverently
it
will
not
however
much
matter
to
him
so
long
as
it
is
all
over
before
partridge
comes
round
the
girls
one
and
all
declared
that
you
must
be
here
as
one
of
the
guests
in
the
house
our
rooms
will
be
mostly
full
of
young
ladies
but
there
will
be
one
at
any
rate
for
you
now
what
day
will
suit
you
or
rather
what
day
will
suit
the
cavalry
generally
everything
must
of
course
depend
on
the
cavalry
the
girls
say
that
the
cavalry
is
sure
to
go
out
of
town
after
the
tenth
of
august
but
they
would
put
it
off
for
a
week
longer
rather
than
not
have
the
would
wednesday
suit
the
cavalry
they
are
all
reading
every
word
of
my
letter
as
it
is
written
and
bid
me
say
that
if
thursday
or
friday
in
that
week
or
wednesday
or
thursday
in
the
next
will
do
better
the
accommodation
of
the
cavalry
shall
be
consulted
it
can
not
be
on
a
monday
or
saturday
because
there
would
be
some
sunday
encroachment
on
tuesday
we
can
not
get
the
band
from
slowbridge
now
you
know
our
great
purpose
and
our
little
difficulties
one
thing
you
can
not
know
how
determined
we
are
to
accommodate
ourselves
to
the
cavalry
meeting
is
not
to
take
place
without
the
so
let
us
have
an
early
answer
from
that
august
functionary
the
girls
think
that
the
inspector
had
better
come
down
before
the
day
so
as
to
make
himself
useful
in
preparing
pray
believe
me
with
sir
walter
s
kind
regards
yours
most
sincerely
margaret
the
major
felt
that
the
letter
was
very
flattering
but
that
it
was
false
and
written
for
a
certain
purpose
he
could
read
between
the
lines
at
every
sentence
of
it
the
festival
was
to
be
got
up
not
at
the
instance
of
the
girls
but
of
lady
wanless
herself
as
a
final
trap
for
the
catching
of
himself
and
perhaps
for
burmeston
those
irreverent
words
had
never
come
from
georgiana
who
was
too
placid
to
have
said
them
he
did
not
believe
a
word
of
the
girls
looking
over
the
writing
of
the
letter
in
all
such
matters
lady
wanless
had
more
life
more
energy
than
her
daughters
all
that
little
fun
about
the
cavalry
came
from
lady
wanless
herself
the
girls
were
too
like
their
father
for
such
ebullitions
the
little
sparks
of
joke
with
which
the
names
of
the
girls
were
connected
with
which
in
his
hearing
the
name
of
georgiana
had
been
specially
connected
had
he
was
aware
their
origin
always
with
lady
wanless
georgiana
had
said
this
funny
thing
and
that
but
georgiana
never
spoke
after
that
fashion
in
his
hearing
the
traps
were
plain
to
his
eyes
and
yet
he
knew
that
he
would
sooner
or
later
be
caught
in
the
traps
he
took
a
day
to
think
of
it
before
he
answered
the
letter
and
meditated
a
military
tour
to
berlin
just
about
the
time
if
so
he
must
be
absent
during
the
whole
of
august
so
as
to
make
his
presence
at
the
toxopholite
meeting
an
impossibility
and
yet
at
last
he
wrote
and
said
that
he
would
be
there
there
would
be
something
mean
in
flight
after
all
he
need
not
ask
the
girl
to
be
his
wife
unless
he
chose
to
do
so
he
wrote
a
very
pretty
note
to
lady
wanless
saying
that
he
would
be
at
brook
park
on
the
as
she
had
suggested
then
he
made
a
great
resolution
and
swore
an
oath
to
himself
that
he
would
not
be
caught
on
that
occasion
and
that
after
this
meeting
he
would
go
no
more
either
to
brook
park
or
to
beetham
for
awhile
he
would
not
marry
the
girl
to
whom
he
was
quite
indifferent
nor
her
who
from
her
position
was
hardly
qualified
to
be
his
wife
then
he
went
about
his
duties
with
a
quieted
conscience
and
wedded
himself
for
once
and
for
always
to
the
cavalry
some
tidings
of
the
doings
proposed
by
the
wanlesses
had
reached
the
parson
s
ears
when
he
told
alice
in
the
lane
that
his
son
was
soon
coming
down
to
beetham
again
and
that
he
was
again
going
to
brook
park
before
july
was
over
the
tidings
of
the
coming
festivity
had
been
spread
over
all
that
side
of
the
county
such
a
thing
had
not
been
done
for
many
years
not
since
lady
wanless
had
been
herself
a
young
wife
with
two
sisters
for
whom
husbands
had
to
be
and
were
provided
there
were
those
who
could
still
remember
how
well
lady
wanless
had
behaved
on
that
occasion
since
those
days
hospitality
on
a
large
scale
had
not
been
rife
at
brook
park
and
the
reason
why
it
was
so
was
well
known
sir
walter
was
determined
not
to
embarrass
himself
further
and
would
do
nothing
that
was
expensive
it
could
not
be
but
that
there
was
great
cause
for
such
a
deviation
as
this
then
the
ladies
of
the
neighbourhood
put
their
heads
together
and
some
of
the
gentlemen
and
declared
that
a
double
stroke
of
business
was
to
be
done
in
regard
to
major
rossiter
and
burmeston
how
great
a
relief
that
would
be
to
the
mother
s
anxiety
if
the
three
eldest
girls
could
be
married
and
got
rid
of
all
on
the
same
day
beetham
which
was
ten
miles
from
brook
park
had
a
station
of
its
own
whereas
slowbridge
with
its
own
station
was
only
six
miles
from
the
house
the
major
would
fain
have
reached
his
destination
by
slowbridge
so
as
to
have
avoided
the
chance
of
seeing
alice
were
it
not
that
his
father
and
mother
would
have
felt
themselves
aggrieved
by
such
desertion
on
this
occasion
his
mother
begged
him
to
give
them
one
night
she
had
much
that
she
wished
to
say
to
him
and
then
of
course
he
could
have
the
parsonage
horse
and
the
parsonage
phaeton
to
take
him
over
to
brook
park
free
of
expense
he
did
go
down
to
beetham
did
spend
an
evening
there
and
did
go
on
to
the
park
without
having
spoken
to
alice
dugdale
everybody
says
you
are
to
marry
georgiana
wanless
said
rossiter
if
there
were
no
other
reason
why
i
should
not
the
saying
of
everybody
would
be
sufficient
against
that
is
unreasonable
john
the
thing
should
be
looked
at
itself
whether
it
is
good
or
bad
it
may
be
the
case
that
lady
wanless
talks
more
than
she
ought
to
do
it
may
be
the
case
that
as
people
say
she
is
looking
out
for
husbands
for
her
daughters
i
don
t
know
but
that
i
should
do
the
same
if
i
had
five
of
them
on
my
hands
and
very
little
means
for
them
and
if
i
did
how
could
i
get
a
better
husband
for
one
of
them
than
such
a
one
as
major
john
rossiter
then
she
kissed
his
forehead
i
hate
the
kind
of
thing
altogether
said
he
he
pretended
to
be
stern
but
yet
he
showed
that
he
was
flattered
by
his
mother
s
softness
it
may
well
be
john
that
such
a
match
shall
be
desirable
to
them
and
to
you
too
if
so
why
should
there
not
be
a
fair
bargain
between
the
two
of
you
you
know
that
you
admire
the
he
would
not
deny
this
lest
it
should
come
to
pass
hereafter
that
she
should
become
his
wife
and
everybody
knows
that
as
far
as
birth
goes
there
is
not
a
family
in
the
county
stands
higher
i
am
so
proud
of
my
boy
that
i
wish
to
see
him
mated
with
the
he
reached
the
parsonage
that
evening
only
just
before
dinner
and
on
the
next
morning
he
did
not
go
out
of
the
house
till
the
phaeton
came
round
to
take
him
to
brook
park
are
you
not
going
up
to
see
the
old
doctor
said
the
parson
after
breakfast
no
i
think
not
he
is
never
at
home
and
the
ladies
are
always
surrounded
by
the
she
will
take
it
amiss
said
the
father
almost
in
a
whisper
i
will
go
as
i
come
back
said
he
blushing
as
he
spoke
at
his
own
falsehood
for
if
he
held
to
his
present
purpose
he
would
return
by
slowbridge
if
fate
intended
that
there
should
be
nothing
further
between
him
and
alice
it
would
certainly
be
much
better
that
they
should
not
be
brought
together
any
more
he
knew
too
what
his
father
meant
and
was
more
unwilling
to
take
counsel
from
his
father
even
than
his
mother
yet
he
blushed
because
he
knew
that
he
was
false
do
not
seem
to
slight
her
said
the
old
man
she
is
too
good
for
then
he
drove
himself
over
to
brook
park
and
as
he
made
his
way
by
one
of
the
innumerable
turnings
out
of
beetham
he
saw
at
one
of
the
corners
alice
still
with
the
children
and
still
with
the
perambulator
he
merely
lifted
his
hat
as
he
passed
but
did
not
stop
to
speak
to
her
chapter
vi
the
archery
meeting
the
assistant
deputy
when
he
reached
brook
park
found
that
things
were
to
be
done
on
a
great
scale
the
two
were
filled
with
flowers
and
the
big
was
laid
out
for
s
lunch
in
preparation
for
those
who
would
prefer
the
to
the
tent
rossiter
was
first
taken
into
the
baronet
s
own
room
where
sir
walter
kept
his
guns
and
administered
justice
this
is
a
terrible
bore
rossiter
he
said
it
must
disturb
you
a
great
deal
sir
oh
dear
dreadfully
what
would
my
old
friend
your
father
think
of
having
to
do
this
kind
of
thing
though
when
i
was
at
christchurch
and
he
at
wadham
we
used
to
be
gay
enough
i
m
not
quite
sure
that
i
don
t
owe
it
to
to
me
sir
walter
i
rather
think
you
put
the
girls
up
to
then
he
laughed
as
though
it
were
a
very
good
joke
and
told
the
major
where
he
would
find
the
ladies
he
had
been
expressly
desired
by
his
wife
to
be
genial
to
the
major
and
had
been
as
genial
as
he
knew
how
rossiter
as
he
went
out
on
to
the
lawn
saw
burmeston
the
brewer
walking
with
edith
the
third
daughter
he
could
not
but
admire
the
strategy
of
lady
wanless
when
he
acknowledged
to
himself
how
well
she
managed
all
these
things
the
brewer
would
not
have
been
allowed
to
walk
with
gertrude
the
fourth
daughter
nor
even
with
maria
the
naughty
girl
who
liked
the
curate
because
it
was
edith
s
turn
edith
was
certainly
the
plainest
of
the
family
and
yet
she
had
her
turn
lady
wanless
was
by
far
too
good
a
mother
to
have
favourites
among
her
own
children
he
then
found
the
mother
the
eldest
daughter
and
gertrude
overseeing
the
decoration
of
a
tent
which
had
been
put
up
as
an
addition
to
the
he
expected
to
find
cobble
to
whom
he
had
taken
a
liking
a
nice
pleasant
frank
young
country
gentleman
but
cobble
was
not
wanted
for
any
express
purpose
and
might
have
been
in
the
way
cobble
was
landed
and
safe
before
long
he
found
himself
walking
round
the
garden
with
lady
wanless
herself
the
other
girls
though
they
were
to
be
his
sisters
were
never
thrown
into
any
special
intimacy
with
him
she
will
be
down
before
long
now
that
she
knows
you
are
here
said
lady
wanless
she
was
fatigued
a
little
and
i
thought
it
better
that
she
should
lie
down
she
is
so
impressionable
you
she
was
georgiana
he
knew
that
very
well
but
why
should
georgiana
be
called
she
to
him
by
her
mother
had
she
been
in
truth
engaged
to
him
it
would
have
been
intelligible
enough
but
there
had
been
nothing
of
the
kind
as
she
was
thus
dinned
into
his
ears
he
thought
of
the
very
small
amount
of
conversation
which
had
ever
taken
place
between
himself
and
the
young
lady
then
there
occurred
to
him
an
idea
that
he
would
tell
lady
wanless
in
so
many
words
that
there
was
a
mistake
the
doing
so
would
require
some
courage
but
he
thought
that
he
could
summon
up
manliness
for
the
purpose
if
only
he
could
find
the
words
and
occasion
but
though
she
were
so
frequently
spoken
of
still
nothing
was
said
which
seemed
to
give
him
the
opportunity
required
it
is
hard
for
a
man
to
have
to
reject
a
girl
when
she
has
been
offered
but
harder
to
do
so
before
the
offer
has
in
truth
been
made
i
am
afraid
there
is
a
little
mistake
in
your
ideas
as
to
me
and
your
it
was
thus
that
he
would
have
had
to
speak
and
then
to
have
endured
the
outpouring
of
her
wrath
when
she
would
have
declared
that
the
ideas
were
only
in
his
own
arrogant
brain
he
let
it
pass
by
and
said
nothing
and
before
long
he
was
playing
with
georgiana
who
did
not
seem
to
have
been
in
the
least
fatigued
my
dear
i
will
not
have
it
said
lady
wanless
about
an
hour
afterwards
coming
up
and
disturbing
the
game
major
rossiter
you
ought
to
know
whereupon
she
playfully
took
the
racket
out
of
the
major
s
hand
mamma
is
such
an
old
bother
said
georgiana
as
she
walked
back
to
the
house
with
her
major
the
major
had
on
a
previous
occasion
perceived
that
the
second
miss
wanless
rode
very
well
and
now
he
saw
that
she
was
very
stout
at
but
he
observed
none
of
that
peculiarity
of
mental
or
physical
development
which
her
mother
had
described
as
nevertheless
she
was
a
handsome
girl
and
if
to
play
at
would
help
to
make
a
husband
happy
so
much
at
any
rate
she
could
do
this
took
place
on
the
day
before
the
meeting
before
the
great
day
when
the
morning
came
the
girls
did
not
come
down
early
to
breakfast
and
our
hero
found
himself
left
alone
with
burmeston
you
have
known
the
family
a
long
time
said
the
major
as
they
were
sauntering
about
the
gravel
paths
together
smoking
their
cigars
no
indeed
said
burmeston
they
only
took
me
up
about
three
months
ago
just
before
we
went
over
to
owless
very
nice
people
don
t
you
think
so
very
nice
said
the
major
they
stand
so
high
in
the
county
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
birth
does
go
a
long
way
you
so
it
ought
said
the
major
and
though
the
baronet
does
not
do
much
in
the
world
he
has
been
in
the
house
you
know
all
those
things
then
the
major
understood
that
burmeston
had
looked
the
thing
in
the
face
and
had
determined
that
for
certain
considerations
it
was
worth
his
while
to
lead
one
of
the
miss
wanlesses
to
the
hymeneal
altar
in
this
burmeston
was
behaving
with
more
manliness
than
he
who
had
almost
made
up
his
mind
times
and
had
never
been
satisfied
with
the
way
he
had
done
it
about
twelve
the
visitors
had
begun
to
come
and
sophia
with
cobble
were
very
soon
trying
their
arrows
together
sophia
had
not
been
allowed
to
have
her
lover
on
the
previous
day
but
was
now
making
up
for
it
that
was
all
very
well
but
lady
wanless
was
a
little
angry
with
her
eldest
daughter
her
success
was
insured
for
her
her
business
was
done
seeing
how
many
sacrifices
had
been
made
to
her
during
the
last
twelvemonths
surely
now
she
might
have
been
active
in
aiding
her
sisters
instead
of
merely
amusing
herself
the
major
was
not
good
at
archery
he
was
no
doubt
an
excellent
deputy
of
cavalry
but
if
bows
and
arrows
had
still
been
the
weapons
used
in
any
part
of
the
british
army
he
would
not
without
further
instruction
have
been
qualified
to
inspect
that
branch
georgiana
wanless
on
the
other
hand
was
a
proficient
such
shooting
as
she
made
was
marvellous
to
look
at
and
she
was
a
very
image
of
diana
as
with
her
beautiful
figure
and
regular
features
dressed
up
to
the
work
she
stood
with
her
bow
raised
in
her
hand
and
let
twang
the
arrows
the
circle
immediately
outside
the
bull
was
the
farthest
from
the
mark
she
ever
touched
but
good
as
she
was
and
bad
as
was
the
major
nevertheless
they
were
appointed
always
to
shoot
together
after
a
world
of
failures
the
major
would
shoot
no
more
but
not
the
less
did
he
go
backwards
and
forwards
with
georgiana
when
she
changed
from
one
end
to
the
other
and
found
himself
absolutely
appointed
to
that
task
it
grew
upon
him
during
the
whole
day
that
this
second
miss
wanless
was
supposed
to
be
his
own
almost
as
much
as
was
the
elder
the
property
of
cobble
other
young
men
would
do
no
more
than
speak
to
her
and
when
once
after
the
great
lunch
in
the
tent
lady
wanless
came
and
put
her
hand
affectionately
upon
his
arm
and
whispered
some
word
into
his
ear
in
the
presence
of
all
the
assembled
guests
he
knew
that
the
entire
county
had
recognised
him
as
caught
there
was
old
lady
deepbell
there
how
it
was
that
towards
the
end
of
the
day
s
delights
lady
deepbell
got
hold
of
him
he
never
knew
lady
deepbell
had
not
been
introduced
to
him
and
yet
she
got
hold
of
him
major
rossiter
you
are
the
luckiest
man
of
the
day
she
said
to
him
pretty
well
said
he
affecting
to
laugh
but
why
so
she
is
the
handsomest
young
woman
out
there
hasn
t
been
one
in
london
this
season
with
such
a
you
are
altogether
wrong
in
your
surmise
lady
no
no
i
am
right
enough
i
see
it
all
of
course
the
poor
girl
won
t
have
any
money
but
then
how
nice
it
is
when
a
gentleman
like
you
is
able
to
dispense
with
that
perhaps
they
do
take
after
their
father
a
little
and
he
certainly
is
not
bright
but
upon
my
word
i
think
a
girl
is
all
the
better
for
that
what
s
the
good
of
having
such
a
lot
of
lady
deepbell
you
are
alluding
to
a
young
lady
without
the
slightest
warrant
said
the
major
warrant
enough
warrant
enough
said
the
old
woman
toddling
off
then
young
cobble
came
to
him
and
talked
to
him
as
though
he
were
a
brother
of
the
house
young
cobble
was
an
honest
fellow
and
quite
in
earnest
in
his
matrimonial
intentions
we
shall
be
delighted
if
you
ll
come
to
us
on
the
first
said
cobble
the
first
of
course
meant
the
first
of
september
we
ain
t
so
badly
off
just
for
a
week
s
shooting
sophia
is
to
be
there
and
we
ll
get
georgiana
the
major
was
fond
of
shooting
and
would
have
been
glad
to
accept
the
offer
but
it
was
out
of
the
question
that
he
should
allow
himself
to
be
taken
in
at
cobble
hall
under
a
false
pretext
and
was
it
not
incumbent
on
him
to
make
this
young
man
understand
that
he
had
no
pretensions
whatever
to
the
hand
of
the
second
miss
wanless
you
are
very
good
said
he
we
should
be
delighted
said
young
cobble
but
i
fear
there
is
a
mistake
i
can
t
say
anything
more
about
it
now
because
it
doesn
t
do
to
name
people
but
there
is
a
mistake
only
for
that
i
should
have
been
delighted
then
he
took
his
departure
leaving
young
cobble
in
a
state
of
mystified
suspense
the
day
lingered
on
to
a
great
length
the
archery
and
the
were
continued
till
late
after
the
lunch
and
towards
the
evening
a
few
couples
stood
up
to
dance
it
was
evident
to
the
major
that
burmeston
and
edith
were
thoroughly
comfortable
together
gertrude
amused
herself
well
and
even
maria
was
contented
though
the
curate
as
a
matter
of
course
was
not
there
sophia
with
her
legitimate
lover
was
as
happy
as
the
day
and
evening
were
long
but
there
came
a
frown
upon
georgiana
s
brow
and
when
at
last
the
major
as
though
forced
by
destiny
asked
her
to
dance
she
refused
it
had
seemed
to
her
a
matter
of
course
that
he
should
ask
her
and
at
last
he
did
but
she
refused
the
evening
with
him
was
very
long
and
just
as
he
thought
that
he
would
escape
to
bed
and
was
meditating
how
early
he
would
be
off
on
the
morrow
lady
wanless
took
possession
of
him
and
carried
him
off
alone
into
one
of
the
desolate
chambers
is
she
very
tired
asked
the
anxious
mother
is
who
tired
the
major
at
that
moment
would
have
given
twenty
guineas
to
have
been
in
his
lodgings
near
james
s
street
my
poor
girl
said
lady
wanless
assuming
a
look
of
great
solicitude
it
was
vain
for
him
to
pretend
not
to
know
who
was
the
she
intended
oh
ah
yes
miss
i
think
she
is
tired
she
was
shooting
a
great
deal
then
there
was
a
quadrille
but
she
didn
t
dance
there
has
been
a
great
deal
to
tire
young
you
shouldn
t
have
let
her
do
so
how
was
he
to
get
out
of
it
what
was
he
to
say
if
a
man
is
clearly
asked
his
intentions
he
can
say
that
he
has
not
got
any
that
used
to
be
the
old
fashion
when
a
gentleman
was
supposed
to
be
dilatory
in
declaring
his
purpose
but
it
gave
the
oscillating
lover
so
easy
an
escape
it
was
like
the
sudden
jerk
of
the
hand
of
the
unpractised
fisherman
if
the
fish
does
not
succumb
at
once
it
goes
away
down
the
stream
and
is
no
more
heard
of
but
from
this
new
process
there
is
no
mode
of
immediate
escape
i
couldn
t
prevent
her
because
she
is
nothing
to
that
would
have
been
the
straightforward
answer
but
one
most
difficult
to
make
i
hope
she
will
be
none
the
worse
morning
said
the
major
i
hope
not
indeed
oh
major
rossiter
the
mother
s
position
was
also
difficult
as
it
is
of
no
use
to
play
with
a
fish
too
long
without
making
an
attempt
to
stick
the
hook
into
his
gills
lady
wanless
what
am
i
to
say
to
you
i
am
sure
you
know
my
feelings
you
know
how
sincere
is
sir
walter
s
i
am
very
much
flattered
lady
that
means
this
was
true
but
the
major
did
not
mean
to
intend
anything
of
all
my
flock
she
is
the
that
was
true
also
the
major
would
have
been
delighted
to
accede
to
the
assertion
of
the
young
lady
s
beauty
if
this
might
have
been
the
end
of
it
i
had
thought
had
thought
what
lady
wanless
if
i
am
deceived
in
you
major
rossiter
i
never
will
believe
in
a
man
again
i
have
looked
upon
you
as
the
very
soul
of
i
trust
that
i
have
done
nothing
to
lessen
your
good
i
do
not
know
i
can
not
say
why
do
you
answer
me
in
this
way
about
my
child
then
she
held
her
hands
together
and
looked
up
into
his
face
imploringly
he
owned
to
himself
that
she
was
a
good
actress
he
was
almost
inclined
to
submit
and
to
declare
his
passion
for
georgiana
for
the
present
that
way
out
of
the
difficulty
would
have
been
so
easy
you
shall
hear
from
me
morning
he
said
almost
solemnly
shall
i
she
asked
grasping
his
hand
oh
my
friend
let
it
be
as
i
desire
my
whole
life
shall
be
devoted
to
making
you
happy
you
and
then
he
was
allowed
to
escape
lady
wanless
before
she
went
to
bed
was
closeted
for
awhile
with
the
eldest
daughter
as
sophia
was
now
almost
as
good
as
a
married
woman
she
was
received
into
closer
counsel
than
the
others
burmeston
will
do
she
said
but
as
for
that
cavalry
man
he
means
it
no
more
than
the
the
pity
was
that
burmeston
might
have
been
secured
without
the
archery
meeting
and
that
all
the
money
spent
on
behalf
of
the
major
should
have
been
thrown
away
chapter
vii
after
the
party
when
the
major
left
brook
park
on
the
morning
after
the
archery
amusements
he
was
quite
sure
of
this
that
under
no
circumstances
whatever
would
he
be
induced
to
ask
miss
georgiana
wanless
to
be
his
wife
he
had
promised
to
write
a
letter
and
he
would
write
one
instantly
he
did
not
conceive
it
possible
but
that
lady
wanless
should
understand
what
would
be
the
purport
of
that
letter
although
as
she
left
him
on
the
previous
night
she
had
pretended
to
hope
otherwise
that
her
hopes
had
not
been
very
high
we
know
from
the
words
which
she
spoke
to
sophia
in
the
privacy
of
her
own
room
he
had
intended
to
return
by
slowbridge
but
when
the
morning
came
he
changed
his
mind
and
went
to
beetham
his
reason
for
doing
so
was
hardly
plain
even
to
himself
he
tried
to
make
himself
believe
that
the
letter
had
better
be
written
from
beetham
hot
as
it
were
from
the
immediate
neighbourhood
than
from
london
but
as
he
thought
of
this
his
mind
was
crowded
with
ideas
of
alice
dugdale
he
would
not
propose
to
alice
at
this
moment
indeed
he
was
averse
to
matrimony
having
been
altogether
disgusted
with
female
society
at
brook
park
but
he
had
to
acknowledge
a
sterling
worth
about
alice
and
the
existence
of
a
genuine
friendship
between
her
and
himself
which
made
it
painful
to
him
to
leave
the
country
without
other
recognition
than
that
raising
of
his
hat
when
he
saw
her
at
the
corner
of
the
lane
he
had
behaved
badly
in
this
brook
park
affair
in
having
been
tempted
thither
in
opposition
to
those
better
instincts
which
had
made
alice
so
pleasant
a
companion
to
him
and
was
ashamed
of
himself
he
did
not
think
that
he
could
go
back
to
his
former
ideas
he
was
aware
that
alice
must
think
ill
of
him
would
not
believe
him
to
be
now
such
as
she
had
once
thought
him
england
and
london
were
distasteful
to
him
he
would
go
abroad
on
that
foreign
service
which
he
had
proposed
to
himself
there
was
an
opening
for
him
to
do
so
if
he
liked
and
he
could
return
to
his
present
duties
after
a
year
or
two
but
he
would
see
alice
again
before
he
went
thinking
of
all
this
he
drove
himself
back
to
beetham
on
that
morning
tidings
of
the
successful
festivities
at
brook
park
reached
the
doctor
s
house
tidings
of
the
coming
festivities
then
of
the
preparations
and
at
last
of
the
festal
day
itself
had
reached
alice
so
that
it
seemed
to
her
that
all
beetham
talked
of
nothing
else
old
lady
deepbell
had
caught
a
cold
walking
about
on
the
lawn
with
hardly
anything
on
her
old
shoulders
stupid
old
woman
and
had
sent
for
the
doctor
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
positively
settled
she
had
said
to
the
doctor
absolutely
arranged
dugdale
lady
wanless
told
me
so
herself
and
i
congratulated
the
she
did
not
go
on
to
say
that
the
gentleman
had
denied
the
accusation
but
then
she
had
not
believed
the
denial
the
doctor
coming
home
had
thought
it
his
duty
to
tell
alice
and
alice
had
received
the
news
with
a
smile
i
knew
it
would
be
so
and
you
this
he
said
holding
her
hand
and
looking
tenderly
into
her
eyes
me
it
will
not
hurt
me
not
that
i
mean
to
tell
a
lie
to
you
father
she
added
after
a
moment
a
woman
isn
t
hurt
because
she
doesn
t
get
a
prize
in
the
lottery
had
it
ever
come
about
i
dare
say
i
should
have
liked
him
well
no
more
than
that
and
why
should
it
have
come
about
she
went
on
saying
avoiding
her
father
s
last
question
determined
not
to
lie
if
she
could
help
it
but
determined
also
to
show
no
wound
i
think
my
position
in
life
very
happy
but
it
isn
t
one
from
which
he
would
choose
a
why
not
my
dear
a
thousand
reasons
i
am
always
busy
and
he
would
naturally
like
a
young
lady
who
had
nothing
to
she
understood
the
effect
of
the
perambulator
and
the
constant
needle
and
thread
besides
though
he
might
be
all
very
well
he
could
never
i
think
be
as
dear
to
me
as
the
bairns
i
should
feel
that
i
lost
more
than
i
got
by
this
she
knew
to
be
a
lie
but
it
was
so
important
that
her
father
should
believe
her
to
be
contented
with
her
home
duties
and
she
was
contented
though
very
unhappy
when
her
father
kissed
her
she
smiled
into
his
face
oh
so
sweetly
so
pleasantly
and
the
old
man
thought
that
she
could
not
have
loved
very
deeply
then
she
took
herself
to
her
own
room
and
sat
awhile
alone
with
a
countenance
much
changed
the
lines
of
sorrow
about
her
brow
were
terrible
there
was
not
a
tear
but
her
mouth
was
close
pressed
and
her
hand
was
working
constantly
by
her
side
she
gazed
at
nothing
but
sat
with
her
eyes
wide
open
staring
straight
before
her
then
she
jumped
up
quickly
and
striking
her
hand
upon
her
heart
she
spoke
aloud
to
herself
i
will
cure
it
she
said
he
is
not
worthy
and
it
should
therefore
be
easier
though
he
were
worthy
i
would
cure
it
yes
bobby
i
am
then
she
went
about
her
work
that
might
have
been
about
noon
it
was
after
their
early
dinner
with
the
children
that
the
major
came
up
to
the
doctor
s
house
he
had
reached
the
parsonage
in
time
for
a
late
breakfast
and
had
then
written
his
letter
after
that
he
had
sat
idling
about
on
the
lawn
not
on
the
best
terms
with
his
mother
to
whom
he
had
sworn
that
under
no
circumstances
would
he
make
georgiana
wanless
his
wife
i
would
sooner
marry
a
girl
from
a
troop
of
dancers
he
had
said
in
his
anger
rossiter
knew
that
he
intended
to
go
up
to
the
doctor
s
house
and
therefore
the
immediate
feeling
between
the
mother
and
son
was
not
pleasant
my
readers
if
they
please
shall
see
the
letter
to
lady
wanless
my
dear
lady
wanless
it
is
a
great
grief
to
me
to
say
that
there
has
been
i
fear
a
misconception
between
you
and
me
on
a
certain
matter
this
is
the
more
a
trouble
to
me
because
you
and
sir
walter
have
been
so
very
kind
to
me
from
a
word
or
two
which
fell
from
you
last
night
i
was
led
to
fear
that
you
suspected
feelings
on
my
part
which
i
have
never
entertained
and
aspirations
to
which
i
have
never
pretended
no
man
can
be
more
alive
than
i
am
to
the
honour
which
has
been
suggested
but
i
feel
bound
to
say
that
i
am
not
in
a
condition
to
accept
it
pray
believe
me
to
be
dear
lady
wanless
yours
always
very
faithfully
john
the
letter
when
it
was
written
was
to
himself
very
unsatisfactory
it
was
full
of
ambiguous
words
and
phraseology
which
disgusted
him
but
he
did
not
know
how
to
alter
it
for
the
better
it
is
hard
to
say
an
uncivil
thing
civilly
without
ambiguous
language
he
could
not
bring
it
out
in
straightforward
stout
english
you
want
me
to
marry
your
daughter
but
i
won
t
do
anything
of
the
so
the
letter
was
sent
the
conduct
of
which
he
was
really
ashamed
did
not
regard
miss
wanless
but
alice
dugdale
at
last
very
slowly
he
took
himself
up
to
the
doctor
s
house
he
hardly
knew
what
it
was
that
he
meant
to
say
when
he
found
himself
there
but
he
was
sure
that
he
did
not
mean
to
make
an
offer
even
had
other
things
suited
there
would
have
been
something
distasteful
to
him
in
doing
this
so
quickly
after
the
affair
of
miss
wanless
he
was
in
no
frame
now
for
making
love
but
yet
it
would
be
ungracious
in
him
he
thought
to
leave
beetham
without
seeing
his
old
friend
he
found
the
two
ladies
together
with
the
children
still
around
them
sitting
near
a
window
which
opened
down
to
the
ground
dugdale
had
a
novel
in
hand
and
as
usual
was
leaning
back
in
a
alice
had
also
a
book
open
on
the
table
before
her
but
she
was
bending
over
a
they
had
latterly
divided
the
cares
of
the
family
between
them
dugdale
had
brought
the
children
into
the
world
and
alice
had
washed
clothed
and
fed
them
when
they
were
there
when
the
major
entered
the
room
alice
s
mind
was
of
course
full
of
the
tidings
she
had
heard
from
her
father
which
tidings
however
had
not
been
communicated
to
dugdale
alice
at
first
was
very
silent
while
dugdale
asked
as
to
the
festivities
it
has
been
the
grandest
thing
anywhere
about
here
for
a
long
and
like
other
grand
things
a
great
bore
said
the
major
i
don
t
suppose
you
found
it
so
major
rossiter
said
the
lady
then
the
conversation
ran
away
into
a
description
of
what
had
been
done
during
the
day
he
wished
to
make
it
understood
that
there
was
no
permanent
link
binding
him
to
brook
park
but
he
hardly
knew
how
to
say
it
without
going
beyond
the
lines
of
ordinary
conversation
at
last
there
seemed
to
be
an
opening
not
exactly
what
he
wished
but
still
an
opening
brook
park
is
not
exactly
the
place
said
he
at
which
i
should
ever
feel
myself
quite
at
this
was
in
answer
to
some
chance
word
which
had
fallen
from
dugdale
i
am
sorry
for
that
said
alice
she
would
have
given
a
guinea
to
bring
the
word
back
after
it
had
been
spoken
but
spoken
words
can
not
be
brought
back
why
sorry
he
asked
smiling
because
oh
because
it
is
so
likely
that
you
may
be
there
i
don
t
know
that
at
you
have
become
so
intimate
with
them
said
alice
we
are
told
in
beetham
that
the
party
was
got
up
all
for
your
so
sir
walter
had
told
him
and
so
maria
the
naughty
girl
had
said
also
only
for
your
beaux
yeux
major
rossiter
we
shouldn
t
have
had
any
party
at
this
had
been
said
by
maria
when
she
was
laughing
at
him
about
her
sister
georgiana
i
don
t
know
how
that
may
be
said
the
major
but
all
the
same
i
shall
never
be
at
home
at
brook
don
t
you
like
the
young
ladies
asked
dugdale
oh
yes
very
much
and
lady
wanless
and
sir
walter
i
like
them
all
in
a
way
but
yet
i
shall
never
find
myself
at
home
at
brook
alice
was
very
angry
with
him
he
ought
not
to
have
gone
there
at
all
he
must
have
known
that
he
could
not
be
there
without
paining
her
she
thoroughly
believed
that
he
was
engaged
to
marry
the
girl
of
whose
family
he
spoke
in
this
way
he
had
thought
so
it
seemed
to
her
that
he
might
lessen
the
blow
to
her
by
making
little
of
the
great
folk
among
whom
his
future
lot
was
to
be
cast
but
what
could
be
more
mean
he
was
not
the
john
rossiter
to
whom
she
had
given
her
heart
there
had
been
no
such
man
she
had
been
mistaken
i
am
afraid
you
are
one
of
those
she
said
who
wherever
they
find
themselves
at
once
begin
to
wish
for
something
that
is
meant
to
be
my
severity
won
t
go
for
i
am
sure
you
have
deserved
it
said
dugdale
most
indiscreetly
is
this
intended
for
an
attack
he
asked
looking
from
one
to
the
other
not
at
all
said
alice
affecting
to
laugh
i
should
have
said
nothing
if
i
thought
mamma
would
take
it
up
so
seriously
i
was
only
sorry
to
hear
you
speak
of
your
new
friends
so
after
that
the
conversation
between
them
was
very
difficult
and
he
soon
got
up
to
go
away
as
he
did
so
he
asked
alice
to
say
a
word
to
him
out
in
the
garden
having
already
explained
to
them
both
that
it
might
be
some
time
before
he
would
be
again
down
at
beetham
alice
rose
slowly
from
her
and
putting
on
her
hat
led
the
way
with
a
composed
and
almost
dignified
step
out
through
the
window
her
heart
was
beating
within
her
but
she
looked
as
though
she
were
mistress
of
every
pulse
why
did
you
say
that
to
me
he
asked
say
what
that
i
always
wished
for
better
things
and
better
people
than
i
because
i
think
you
ambitious
and
discontented
there
is
nothing
disgraceful
in
that
though
it
is
not
the
character
which
i
myself
like
the
you
meant
to
allude
specially
to
the
wanlesses
because
you
have
just
come
from
there
and
were
speaking
of
and
to
one
of
that
family
specially
no
major
rossiter
there
you
are
wrong
i
alluded
to
no
one
in
particular
they
are
nothing
to
me
i
do
not
know
them
but
i
hear
that
they
are
kind
and
friendly
people
with
good
manners
and
very
handsome
of
course
i
know
as
we
all
know
everything
of
each
other
in
this
little
place
that
you
have
of
late
become
very
intimate
with
them
then
when
i
hear
you
aver
that
you
are
already
discontented
with
them
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
you
are
hard
to
please
i
am
sorry
that
mamma
spoke
of
deserving
i
did
not
intend
to
say
anything
so
alice
well
major
i
wish
i
could
make
you
understand
i
do
not
know
that
that
would
do
any
good
we
have
been
old
friends
and
of
course
i
hope
that
you
may
be
happy
i
must
say
now
i
can
not
go
beyond
the
gate
because
i
am
wanted
to
take
the
children
then
i
hope
you
will
not
think
ill
of
why
should
i
think
ill
of
you
i
think
very
well
only
that
you
are
as
she
said
this
she
laughed
again
and
then
she
left
him
he
had
been
most
anxious
to
tell
her
that
he
was
not
going
to
marry
that
girl
but
he
had
not
known
how
to
do
it
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
declare
that
he
would
not
marry
a
girl
when
by
such
declaration
he
would
have
been
forced
to
assume
that
he
might
marry
her
if
he
pleased
so
he
left
alice
at
the
gate
and
she
went
back
to
the
house
still
convinced
that
he
was
betrothed
to
georgiana
wanless
chapter
viii
sir
walter
up
in
london
the
major
when
he
left
the
doctor
s
house
was
more
thoroughly
in
love
with
alice
than
ever
there
had
been
something
in
her
gait
as
she
led
the
way
out
through
the
window
and
again
as
with
determined
purpose
she
bade
him
speedily
farewell
at
the
gate
which
forced
him
to
acknowledge
that
the
dragging
of
perambulators
and
the
making
of
petticoats
had
not
detracted
from
her
feminine
charm
or
from
her
feminine
dignity
she
had
been
dressed
in
her
ordinary
morning
frock
the
very
frock
on
which
he
had
more
than
once
seen
the
marks
of
bobby
s
dirty
heels
but
she
had
pleased
his
eye
better
than
georgiana
clad
in
all
the
glory
of
her
toxopholite
array
the
toxopholite
feather
had
been
very
knowing
the
tight
leathern
belt
round
her
waist
had
been
bright
in
colour
and
pretty
in
design
the
dress
fit
for
the
work
in
hand
had
been
gratifying
but
with
it
all
there
had
been
the
show
of
a
thing
got
up
for
ornament
and
not
for
use
she
was
like
a
box
of
painted
very
pretty
to
the
eye
but
of
which
no
one
wants
to
extract
any
for
the
purpose
of
eating
them
alice
was
like
a
housewife
s
store
kept
beautifully
in
order
but
intended
chiefly
for
comfortable
use
as
he
went
up
to
london
he
began
to
doubt
whether
he
would
go
abroad
were
he
to
let
a
few
months
pass
by
would
not
alice
be
still
there
and
willing
perhaps
to
receive
him
with
more
kindness
when
she
should
have
heard
that
his
follies
at
brook
park
were
at
an
end
three
days
after
his
return
when
he
was
sitting
in
his
offices
thinking
perhaps
more
of
alice
dugdale
than
of
the
whole
british
cavalry
a
soldier
who
was
in
waiting
brought
a
card
to
him
sir
walter
wanless
had
come
to
call
upon
him
if
he
were
disengaged
sir
walter
would
be
glad
to
see
him
he
was
not
at
all
anxious
to
see
sir
walter
but
there
was
no
alternative
and
sir
walter
was
shown
into
the
room
in
explaining
the
purport
of
sir
walter
s
visit
we
must
go
back
for
a
few
minutes
to
brook
park
when
sir
walter
came
down
to
breakfast
on
the
morning
after
the
festivities
he
was
surprised
to
hear
that
major
rossiter
had
taken
his
departure
there
sat
young
burmeston
he
at
any
rate
was
safe
and
there
sat
young
cobble
who
by
sophia
s
aid
had
managed
to
get
himself
accommodated
for
the
night
and
all
the
other
young
people
including
the
five
wanless
girls
the
father
though
not
observant
could
see
that
georgiana
was
very
glum
lady
wanless
herself
affected
a
which
hardly
deceived
him
and
certainly
did
not
deceive
anyone
else
he
was
obliged
to
be
off
this
morning
because
of
his
duties
said
lady
wanless
he
told
me
that
it
was
to
be
so
but
i
did
not
like
to
say
anything
about
it
georgiana
turned
up
her
nose
as
much
as
to
say
that
the
going
and
coming
of
major
rossiter
was
not
a
matter
of
much
importance
to
any
one
there
and
least
of
all
to
her
except
the
father
there
was
not
a
person
in
the
room
who
was
not
aware
that
lady
wanless
had
missed
her
fish
but
she
herself
was
not
quite
sure
even
yet
that
she
had
failed
altogether
she
was
a
woman
who
hated
failure
and
who
seldom
failed
she
was
brave
of
heart
too
and
able
to
fight
a
losing
battle
to
the
last
she
was
very
angry
with
the
major
who
she
well
knew
was
endeavouring
to
escape
from
her
toils
but
he
would
not
on
that
account
be
the
less
useful
as
a
nor
on
that
account
was
she
the
more
willing
to
allow
him
to
escape
with
five
daughters
without
fortunes
it
behoved
her
as
a
mother
to
be
persistent
she
would
not
give
it
up
but
must
turn
the
matter
well
in
her
mind
before
she
took
further
steps
she
feared
that
a
simple
invitation
could
hardly
bring
the
major
back
to
brook
park
then
there
came
the
letter
from
the
major
which
did
not
make
the
matter
easier
my
dear
she
said
to
her
husband
sitting
down
opposite
to
him
in
his
room
that
major
rossiter
isn
t
behaving
quite
as
he
ought
to
i
m
not
a
bit
surprised
said
the
baronet
angrily
i
never
knew
anybody
from
wadham
behave
he
s
quite
a
gentleman
if
you
mean
that
said
lady
wanless
and
he
s
sure
to
do
very
well
in
the
world
and
poor
georgiana
is
really
fond
of
him
which
doesn
t
surprise
me
in
the
has
he
said
anything
to
make
her
fond
of
him
i
suppose
she
has
gone
and
made
a
fool
of
herself
like
not
at
all
he
has
said
a
great
deal
to
her
much
more
than
he
ought
to
have
done
if
he
meant
nothing
but
the
truth
is
young
men
nowadays
never
know
their
own
minds
unless
there
is
somebody
to
keep
them
up
to
the
mark
you
must
go
and
see
i
said
the
afflicted
father
of
course
my
dear
a
few
judicious
words
in
such
a
case
may
do
so
much
i
would
not
ask
walter
to
go
walter
was
the
eldest
son
who
was
with
his
regiment
because
it
might
lead
to
quarrelling
i
would
not
have
anything
of
that
kind
if
only
for
the
dear
girl
s
sake
but
what
you
would
say
would
be
known
to
nobody
and
it
might
have
the
desired
effect
of
course
you
will
be
very
quiet
and
very
serious
also
nobody
could
do
it
better
than
you
will
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
he
has
trifled
with
the
dear
girl
s
affections
why
else
has
he
been
with
her
whenever
he
has
been
here
it
was
so
visible
on
wednesday
that
everybody
was
congratulating
me
old
lady
deepbell
asked
whether
the
day
was
fixed
i
treated
him
quite
as
though
it
were
settled
young
men
do
so
often
get
these
sudden
starts
of
doubt
then
sometimes
just
a
word
afterwards
will
put
it
all
in
this
way
the
baronet
was
made
to
understand
that
he
must
go
and
see
the
major
he
postponed
the
unwelcome
task
till
his
wife
at
last
drove
him
out
of
the
house
my
dear
she
said
will
you
let
your
child
die
for
want
of
a
word
when
it
was
put
to
him
in
that
way
he
found
himself
obliged
to
go
though
to
tell
the
truth
he
could
not
find
any
sign
of
sorrow
about
his
child
he
was
not
allowed
to
speak
to
georgiana
herself
his
wife
telling
him
that
the
poor
child
would
be
unable
to
bear
it
sir
walter
when
he
was
shown
into
the
major
s
room
felt
himself
to
be
very
ill
able
to
conduct
the
business
in
hand
and
to
the
major
himself
the
moment
was
one
of
considerable
trouble
he
had
thought
it
possible
that
he
might
receive
an
answer
to
his
letter
a
reply
that
might
be
indignant
or
piteous
admonitory
or
simply
abusive
as
the
case
might
be
one
which
might
too
probably
require
a
further
correspondence
but
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
that
sir
walter
would
come
in
person
but
here
he
was
in
the
room
by
no
means
with
that
pretended
air
of
geniality
with
which
he
had
last
received
the
major
down
at
brook
park
the
greeting
however
between
the
gentlemen
was
courteous
if
not
cordial
and
then
sir
walter
began
his
task
we
were
quite
surprised
you
should
have
left
us
so
early
that
i
had
told
lady
yes
i
know
nevertheless
we
were
surprised
now
major
rossiter
what
do
you
mean
to
do
about
about
about
this
young
lady
the
major
sat
silent
he
could
not
pretend
to
be
ignorant
what
young
lady
was
intended
after
the
letter
which
he
had
himself
written
to
lady
wanless
this
you
know
is
a
very
painful
kind
of
thing
major
very
painful
indeed
sir
when
i
remembered
that
i
had
been
at
christchurch
and
your
excellent
father
at
wadham
both
at
the
same
time
i
thought
that
i
might
trust
you
in
my
house
without
the
slightest
i
make
bold
to
say
sir
walter
that
you
were
quite
justified
in
that
expectation
whether
it
was
founded
on
your
having
been
at
christchurch
or
on
my
position
and
character
in
the
he
knew
that
the
scene
would
be
easier
to
him
if
he
could
work
himself
up
to
a
little
indignation
on
his
own
part
and
yet
i
am
told
i
am
told
what
are
you
told
sir
walter
there
can
i
think
be
no
doubt
that
you
have
in
point
of
fact
paid
attention
to
my
sir
walter
was
a
gentleman
and
felt
that
the
task
imposed
upon
him
grated
against
his
better
feelings
if
you
mean
that
i
have
taken
steps
to
win
her
affections
you
have
been
wrongly
that
s
what
i
do
mean
were
you
not
received
just
now
at
brook
park
as
as
paying
attention
to
her
i
hope
you
hope
not
major
rossiter
i
hope
no
such
mistake
was
made
it
certainly
was
not
made
by
me
i
felt
myself
much
flattered
by
being
received
at
your
house
i
wrote
the
other
day
a
line
or
two
to
lady
wanless
and
thought
i
had
explained
all
sir
walter
opened
his
eyes
when
he
heard
for
the
first
time
of
the
letter
but
was
sharp
enough
not
to
exhibit
his
ignorance
at
the
moment
i
don
t
know
about
explaining
he
said
there
are
some
things
which
can
t
be
so
very
well
explained
my
wife
assures
me
that
that
poor
girl
has
been
deceived
cruelly
deceived
now
i
put
it
to
you
major
rossiter
what
ought
you
as
a
gentleman
to
do
really
sir
walter
you
are
not
entitled
to
ask
me
any
such
not
on
behalf
of
my
own
child
i
can
not
go
into
the
matter
from
that
view
of
the
case
i
can
only
declare
that
i
have
said
nothing
and
done
nothing
for
which
i
can
blame
myself
i
can
not
understand
how
there
should
have
been
such
a
mistake
but
it
did
not
at
any
rate
arise
with
then
the
baronet
sat
dumb
he
had
been
specially
instructed
not
to
give
up
the
interview
till
he
had
obtained
some
sign
of
weakness
from
the
enemy
if
he
could
only
induce
the
enemy
to
promise
another
visit
to
brook
park
that
would
be
much
if
he
could
obtain
some
expression
of
liking
or
admiration
for
the
young
lady
that
would
be
something
if
he
could
induce
the
major
to
allude
to
delay
as
being
necessary
farther
operations
would
be
founded
on
that
base
but
nothing
had
been
obtained
it
s
the
most
the
most
the
most
astonishing
thing
i
ever
heard
he
said
at
last
i
do
not
know
that
i
can
say
anything
i
ll
tell
you
what
said
the
baronet
come
down
and
see
lady
wanless
the
women
understand
these
things
much
better
than
we
do
come
down
and
talk
it
over
with
lady
wanless
she
won
t
propose
anything
that
isn
t
in
answer
to
this
the
major
shook
his
head
you
won
t
it
would
do
no
good
sir
walter
it
would
be
painful
to
me
and
must
i
should
say
be
distressing
to
the
young
then
you
won
t
do
anything
there
is
nothing
to
be
upon
my
word
i
never
heard
such
a
thing
in
all
my
life
major
rossiter
you
come
down
to
my
house
and
then
then
then
you
won
t
you
won
t
come
again
to
be
sure
he
was
at
wadham
but
i
did
think
your
father
s
son
would
have
behaved
then
he
picked
up
his
hat
from
the
floor
and
shuffled
out
of
the
room
without
another
word
tidings
that
sir
walter
had
been
up
to
london
and
had
called
upon
major
rossiter
made
their
way
into
beetham
and
reached
the
ears
of
the
dugdales
but
not
correct
tidings
as
to
the
nature
of
the
conversation
i
wonder
when
it
will
be
said
dugdale
to
alice
as
he
has
been
up
to
town
i
suppose
it
ll
be
settled
the
sooner
the
better
for
all
parties
said
alice
cheerily
when
a
man
and
a
woman
have
agreed
together
i
can
t
see
why
they
shouldn
t
at
once
walk
off
to
the
church
arm
in
the
lawyers
have
so
much
to
bother
the
lawyers
the
parson
ought
to
do
all
that
is
necessary
and
the
sooner
the
better
then
there
would
not
be
such
paraphernalia
of
presents
and
gowns
and
eatings
and
drinkings
all
of
which
is
got
up
for
the
good
of
the
tradesmen
if
i
were
to
be
married
i
should
like
to
slip
out
round
the
corner
just
as
though
i
were
going
to
get
an
extra
loaf
of
bread
from
that
wouldn
t
do
for
my
lady
at
brook
i
suppose
nor
yet
for
the
then
alice
shook
her
head
and
sighed
and
took
herself
out
to
walk
alone
for
a
few
minutes
among
the
lanes
how
could
it
be
that
he
should
be
so
different
from
that
which
she
had
taken
him
to
be
it
was
now
september
and
she
could
remember
an
early
evening
in
may
when
the
leaves
were
beginning
to
be
full
and
they
were
walking
together
with
the
spring
air
fresh
around
them
just
where
she
was
now
creeping
alone
with
the
more
perfect
and
less
fresh
beauty
of
the
autumn
around
her
how
different
a
person
he
seemed
to
her
to
be
now
from
that
which
he
had
seemed
to
be
then
not
different
because
he
did
not
love
her
but
different
because
he
was
not
fit
to
be
loved
alice
he
had
then
said
you
and
i
are
alike
in
this
that
simple
serviceable
things
are
dear
to
both
of
the
words
had
meant
so
much
to
her
that
she
had
never
forgotten
them
was
she
simple
and
serviceable
so
that
she
might
be
dear
to
him
she
had
been
sure
then
that
he
was
simple
and
that
he
was
serviceable
so
that
she
could
love
him
it
was
thus
that
she
had
spoken
of
him
to
herself
thinking
herself
to
be
sure
of
his
character
and
now
before
the
summer
was
over
he
was
engaged
to
marry
such
a
one
as
georgiana
wanless
and
to
become
the
hero
of
a
fashionable
wedding
but
she
took
pride
to
herself
as
she
walked
alone
that
she
had
already
overcome
the
bitterness
of
the
malady
which
for
a
day
or
two
had
been
so
heavy
that
she
had
feared
for
herself
that
it
would
oppress
her
for
a
day
or
two
after
that
farewell
at
the
gate
she
had
with
a
rigid
purpose
tied
herself
to
every
duty
even
to
the
duty
of
looking
pleasant
in
her
father
s
eyes
of
joining
in
the
children
s
games
of
sharing
the
gossip
of
her
stepmother
but
this
she
had
done
with
an
agony
that
nearly
crushed
her
now
she
had
won
her
way
through
it
and
could
see
her
path
before
her
she
had
not
cured
altogether
that
wound
in
her
heart
but
she
had
assured
herself
that
she
could
live
on
without
further
interference
from
the
wound
chapter
ix
lady
deepbell
then
by
degrees
it
began
to
be
rumoured
about
the
country
and
at
last
through
the
lanes
of
beetham
itself
that
the
alliance
between
major
rossiter
and
miss
georgiana
wanless
was
not
quite
a
settled
thing
burmeston
had
whispered
in
slowbridge
that
there
was
a
screw
loose
perhaps
thinking
that
if
another
could
escape
why
not
he
also
cobble
who
had
no
idea
of
escaping
declared
his
conviction
that
major
rossiter
ought
to
be
horsewhipped
but
lady
deepbell
was
the
real
who
carried
the
news
far
and
wide
but
all
of
them
heard
it
before
alice
and
when
others
believed
it
alice
did
not
believe
it
or
indeed
care
to
believe
or
not
to
believe
lady
deepbell
filled
a
middle
situation
half
way
between
the
established
superiority
of
brook
park
and
the
recognised
humility
of
beetham
her
title
went
for
something
but
her
husband
had
been
only
a
civil
service
knight
who
had
deserved
well
of
his
country
by
a
meritorious
longevity
she
lived
in
a
pretty
little
cottage
half
way
between
brook
park
and
beetham
which
was
just
large
enough
to
enable
her
to
talk
of
her
grounds
she
loved
brook
park
dearly
and
all
the
county
people
but
in
her
love
for
social
intercourse
generally
she
was
unable
to
eschew
the
more
frequent
gatherings
of
the
village
she
was
intimate
not
only
with
rossiter
but
with
the
tweeds
and
dugdales
and
simkinses
and
while
she
could
enjoy
greatly
the
grandeur
of
the
wanless
aristocracy
so
could
she
accommodate
herself
comfortably
to
the
cosy
gossip
of
the
beethamites
it
was
she
who
first
spread
the
report
in
beetham
that
major
rossiter
was
as
she
called
it
she
first
mentioned
the
matter
to
rossiter
herself
but
this
she
did
in
a
manner
more
subdued
than
usual
the
alliance
had
been
high
and
she
was
inclined
to
think
that
rossiter
would
be
disappointed
we
did
think
rossiter
that
these
young
people
at
brook
park
had
meant
something
the
other
rossiter
did
not
stand
in
awe
of
lady
deepbell
and
was
not
pleased
at
the
allusion
it
would
be
much
better
if
young
people
could
be
allowed
to
arrange
their
own
affairs
without
so
much
tattling
about
it
she
said
angrily
that
s
all
very
well
but
tongues
will
talk
you
know
rossiter
i
am
sorry
for
both
their
sakes
because
i
thought
that
it
would
do
very
very
well
indeed
if
the
young
people
as
you
call
them
liked
each
but
i
suppose
it
s
over
now
rossiter
i
really
know
nothing
about
it
lady
then
the
old
woman
quite
satisfied
after
this
that
the
alliance
had
fallen
to
the
ground
went
on
to
the
tweeds
i
never
thought
it
would
come
to
much
said
tweed
i
don
t
see
why
it
shouldn
t
said
matilda
tweed
georgiana
wanless
is
in
a
certain
way
but
they
none
of
them
have
a
penny
and
major
rossiter
is
quite
a
fashionable
the
tweeds
were
quite
outside
the
wanless
pale
and
it
was
the
feeling
of
this
that
made
matilda
love
to
talk
about
the
second
miss
wanless
by
her
christian
name
i
suppose
he
will
go
back
to
alice
now
said
clara
the
younger
tweed
girl
i
don
t
see
that
at
all
said
tweed
i
never
believed
much
in
that
story
said
lady
deepbell
nor
i
either
said
matilda
he
used
to
walk
about
with
her
but
what
does
that
come
to
the
children
were
always
with
them
i
never
would
believe
that
he
was
going
to
make
so
little
of
but
is
it
quite
sure
that
all
the
affair
at
brook
park
will
come
to
nothing
after
the
party
and
everything
asked
tweed
quite
positive
said
lady
deepbell
authoritatively
i
am
able
to
say
certainly
that
that
is
all
then
she
toddled
off
and
went
to
the
simkinses
the
rumour
did
not
reach
the
doctor
s
house
on
that
day
the
conviction
that
major
rossiter
had
behaved
badly
to
alice
that
alice
had
been
utterly
thrown
over
by
the
wanless
alliance
had
been
so
strong
that
even
lady
deepbell
had
not
dared
to
go
and
probe
wilfully
that
wound
the
feeling
in
this
respect
had
been
so
general
that
no
one
in
beetham
had
been
enough
to
speak
to
alice
either
of
the
triumph
of
miss
wanless
or
of
the
misconduct
of
the
major
and
now
lady
deepbell
was
afraid
to
carry
her
story
thither
it
was
the
doctor
himself
who
first
brought
the
tidings
to
the
house
and
did
not
do
this
till
some
days
after
lady
deepbell
had
been
in
the
village
you
had
better
not
say
anything
to
alice
about
such
at
first
had
been
the
doctor
s
injunction
to
his
wife
one
way
or
the
other
it
will
only
be
a
trouble
to
dugdale
full
of
her
secret
anxious
to
be
obedient
thinking
that
the
gentleman
relieved
from
his
second
love
would
be
ready
at
once
to
be
on
again
with
his
first
was
so
fluttered
and
fussy
that
alice
knew
that
there
was
something
to
be
told
you
have
got
some
great
secret
mamma
she
said
what
secret
alice
i
know
you
have
don
t
wait
for
me
to
ask
you
to
tell
it
if
it
is
to
come
let
it
i
m
not
going
to
say
very
well
mamma
then
nothing
shall
be
alice
you
are
the
most
provoking
young
woman
i
ever
had
to
deal
with
in
my
life
if
i
had
twenty
secrets
i
would
not
tell
you
one
of
on
the
next
morning
alice
heard
it
all
from
her
father
i
knew
there
was
something
by
mamma
s
manner
she
said
i
told
her
not
to
say
so
i
suppose
but
what
does
it
matter
to
me
papa
whether
major
rossiter
does
or
does
not
marry
miss
wanless
if
he
has
given
her
his
word
i
am
sure
i
hope
that
he
will
keep
i
don
t
suppose
he
ever
even
then
it
doesn
t
matter
papa
do
not
trouble
yourself
about
but
you
i
have
gone
through
the
fire
and
have
come
out
without
being
much
scorched
dear
papa
i
do
so
wish
that
you
should
understand
it
all
it
is
so
nice
to
have
some
one
to
whom
everything
can
be
told
i
did
like
and
he
i
have
nothing
to
say
about
that
not
a
word
girls
i
suppose
are
often
foolish
and
take
things
for
more
than
they
are
intended
to
mean
i
have
no
accusation
to
make
against
him
but
i
did
i
did
allow
myself
to
be
weak
then
came
this
about
miss
wanless
and
i
was
unhappy
i
woke
from
a
dream
and
the
waking
was
painful
but
i
have
got
over
it
i
do
not
think
that
you
will
ever
know
from
your
girl
s
manner
that
anything
has
been
the
matter
with
my
brave
girl
but
don
t
let
mamma
talk
to
me
as
though
he
could
come
back
because
the
other
girl
has
not
suited
him
he
is
welcome
to
the
other
girl
welcome
to
do
without
her
welcome
to
do
with
himself
as
it
may
best
please
him
but
he
shall
not
trouble
me
there
was
a
stern
strength
in
her
voice
as
she
said
this
which
forced
her
father
to
look
at
her
almost
with
amazement
do
not
think
that
i
am
fierce
fierce
my
darling
but
that
i
am
in
earnest
of
course
if
he
comes
to
beetham
we
shall
see
him
but
let
him
be
like
anybody
else
don
t
let
it
be
supposed
that
because
he
flitted
here
once
and
was
made
welcome
like
a
bird
that
comes
in
at
the
window
and
then
flitted
away
again
that
he
can
be
received
in
at
the
window
just
as
before
should
he
fly
this
way
any
more
that
s
all
then
as
before
she
went
off
by
herself
to
give
herself
renewed
strength
by
her
solitary
thinkings
she
had
so
healed
the
flesh
round
that
wound
that
there
was
no
longer
danger
of
mortification
she
must
now
take
care
that
there
should
be
no
further
wound
the
people
around
her
would
be
sure
to
tell
her
of
this
breach
between
her
late
lover
and
the
wanless
young
lady
the
tweeds
and
the
simkinses
and
old
lady
deepbell
would
be
full
of
it
she
must
take
care
so
to
answer
them
at
the
first
word
that
they
should
not
dare
to
talk
to
her
of
major
rossiter
she
had
cured
herself
so
that
she
no
longer
staggered
under
the
effects
of
the
blow
having
done
that
she
would
not
allow
herself
to
be
subject
to
the
little
stings
of
the
little
creatures
around
her
she
had
had
enough
of
love
of
a
man
s
love
and
would
make
herself
happy
now
with
bobby
and
the
other
bairns
he
ll
be
sure
to
come
back
said
mrs
dugdale
to
her
husband
we
shall
do
no
good
by
talking
about
it
said
the
doctor
if
you
will
take
my
advice
you
will
not
mention
his
name
to
her
i
fear
that
he
is
worthless
and
unworthy
of
that
might
be
very
well
thought
dugdale
but
no
one
in
the
village
doubted
that
he
had
at
the
very
least
a
year
and
that
he
was
a
handsome
man
and
such
a
one
as
is
not
to
be
picked
up
under
every
hedge
the
very
men
who
go
about
the
world
most
like
butterflies
before
marriage
steady
down
the
best
afterwards
these
were
her
words
as
she
discussed
the
matter
with
tweed
and
they
both
agreed
that
if
the
hero
showed
himself
again
at
the
doctor
s
house
bygones
ought
to
be
lady
wanless
even
after
her
husband
s
return
from
london
declared
to
herself
that
even
yet
the
game
had
not
been
altogether
played
out
sir
walter
who
had
been
her
only
possible
direct
messenger
to
the
man
himself
had
been
she
was
aware
as
bad
a
messenger
as
could
have
been
selected
he
could
be
neither
authoritative
nor
persuasive
therefore
when
he
told
her
on
coming
home
that
it
was
easy
to
perceive
that
major
rossiter
s
father
could
not
have
been
educated
at
christchurch
she
did
not
feel
very
much
disappointed
as
her
next
step
she
determined
to
call
on
rossiter
if
that
should
fail
she
must
beard
the
lion
in
his
den
and
go
herself
to
major
rossiter
at
the
horse
guards
she
did
not
doubt
but
that
she
would
at
least
be
able
to
say
more
than
sir
walter
rossiter
she
was
aware
was
herself
favourable
to
the
match
my
dear
rossiter
she
said
in
her
most
confidential
manner
there
is
a
little
something
wrong
among
these
young
people
which
i
think
you
and
i
can
put
right
if
we
put
our
heads
if
i
know
one
of
the
young
people
said
rossiter
it
will
be
very
hard
to
make
him
change
his
he
has
been
very
attentive
to
the
young
of
course
i
know
nothing
about
it
lady
wanless
i
never
saw
them
dear
georgiana
is
so
very
quiet
that
she
said
nothing
even
to
me
but
i
really
thought
that
he
had
proposed
to
her
she
won
t
say
a
word
against
him
but
i
believe
he
did
now
rossiter
what
has
been
the
meaning
of
it
how
is
a
mother
to
answer
for
her
son
lady
wanless
no
of
course
not
i
know
that
girls
of
course
are
different
but
i
thought
that
perhaps
you
might
know
something
about
it
for
i
did
imagine
you
would
like
the
so
i
should
why
not
nobody
thinks
more
of
birth
than
i
do
and
nothing
in
my
opinion
could
have
been
nicer
for
john
but
he
does
not
see
with
my
eyes
if
i
were
to
talk
to
him
for
a
week
it
would
have
no
is
it
that
girl
of
the
doctor
s
rossiter
i
think
not
my
idea
is
that
when
he
has
turned
it
all
over
in
his
mind
he
has
come
to
the
conclusion
that
he
will
be
better
without
a
wife
than
with
we
might
cure
him
of
that
rossiter
if
i
could
only
have
him
down
there
at
brook
park
for
another
week
i
am
sure
he
would
come
rossiter
however
could
not
say
that
she
thought
it
probable
that
her
son
would
be
induced
soon
to
pay
another
visit
to
brook
park
a
week
after
this
lady
wanless
absolutely
did
find
her
way
into
the
major
s
presence
at
the
horse
guards
but
without
much
success
the
last
words
at
that
interview
only
shall
be
given
to
the
reader
the
last
words
as
they
were
spoken
both
by
the
lady
and
by
the
gentleman
then
i
am
to
see
my
girl
die
of
a
broken
heart
said
lady
wanless
with
her
handkerchief
up
to
her
eyes
i
hope
not
lady
wanless
but
in
whatever
way
she
might
die
the
fault
would
not
be
there
was
a
frown
on
the
gentleman
s
brow
as
he
said
this
which
cowed
even
the
lady
as
she
went
back
to
slowbridge
that
afternoon
and
then
home
to
brook
park
she
determined
at
last
that
the
game
must
be
looked
upon
as
played
out
there
was
no
longer
any
ground
on
which
to
stand
and
fight
before
she
went
to
bed
that
night
she
sent
for
georgiana
my
darling
child
she
said
that
man
is
unworthy
of
i
always
thought
he
was
said
georgiana
and
so
there
was
an
end
to
that
little
episode
in
the
family
of
the
wanlesses
chapter
x
the
bird
that
pecked
at
the
window
the
bird
that
had
flown
in
at
the
window
and
had
been
made
welcome
had
flown
away
ungratefully
let
him
come
again
pecking
as
he
might
at
the
window
no
more
crumbs
of
love
should
be
thrown
to
him
alice
with
a
steady
purpose
had
resolved
on
that
with
all
her
humble
ways
her
continual
darning
of
stockings
her
cutting
of
bread
and
butter
for
the
children
her
pushing
of
the
perambulator
in
the
lanes
there
was
a
pride
about
her
a
knowledge
of
her
own
dignity
as
a
woman
which
could
have
been
stronger
in
the
bosom
of
no
woman
of
title
of
wealth
or
of
fashion
she
claimed
nothing
she
had
expected
no
admiration
she
had
been
contented
to
take
the
world
as
it
came
to
her
without
thinking
much
of
love
or
romance
when
john
rossiter
had
first
shown
himself
at
beetham
after
his
return
from
india
and
when
he
had
welcomed
her
so
warmly
too
warmly
as
his
old
playfellow
no
idea
had
occurred
to
her
that
he
would
ever
be
more
to
her
than
her
old
playfellow
her
own
heart
was
too
precious
to
herself
to
be
given
away
idly
to
the
first
comer
then
the
bird
had
flown
in
at
the
window
and
it
had
been
that
the
coming
of
the
stranger
had
been
very
sweet
to
her
but
even
for
the
stranger
she
would
not
change
her
ways
unless
perchance
some
day
she
might
appertain
to
the
stranger
then
it
would
be
her
duty
to
fit
herself
entirely
to
him
in
the
meantime
when
he
gave
her
little
hints
that
something
of
her
domestic
slavery
might
be
discontinued
she
would
not
abate
a
jot
from
her
duties
if
he
liked
to
come
with
her
when
she
pushed
the
children
let
him
come
if
he
cared
to
see
her
when
she
was
darning
a
stocking
or
cutting
bread
and
butter
let
him
pay
his
visits
if
he
thought
those
things
derogatory
certainty
let
him
stay
away
so
the
thing
had
grown
till
she
had
found
herself
surprised
and
taken
as
it
were
into
a
net
caught
in
a
pitfall
of
love
but
she
held
her
peace
stuck
manfully
to
the
perambulator
and
was
a
little
colder
in
her
demeanour
than
heretofore
whereupon
major
rossiter
as
the
reader
is
aware
made
two
visits
to
brook
park
the
bird
might
peck
at
the
window
but
he
should
never
again
be
taken
into
the
room
but
the
bird
from
the
moment
in
which
he
had
packed
up
his
portmanteau
at
brook
park
had
determined
that
he
would
be
taken
in
at
the
window
again
that
he
would
at
any
rate
return
to
the
window
and
peck
at
the
glass
with
constancy
soliciting
that
it
might
be
opened
as
he
now
thought
of
the
two
girls
the
womanliness
of
the
one
as
compared
with
the
worldliness
of
the
other
conquered
him
completely
there
had
never
been
a
moment
in
which
his
heart
had
in
truth
inclined
itself
towards
the
young
athlete
of
brook
park
never
a
moment
hardly
a
moment
in
which
his
heart
had
been
untrue
to
alice
but
glitter
had
for
awhile
prevailed
with
him
and
he
had
just
for
a
moment
allowed
himself
to
be
discontented
with
the
homely
colour
of
unalloyed
gold
he
was
thoroughly
ashamed
of
himself
knowing
well
that
he
had
given
pain
he
had
learned
clearly
enough
from
what
her
father
mother
and
others
had
said
to
him
that
there
were
those
who
expected
him
to
marry
alice
dugdale
and
others
who
hoped
that
he
would
marry
georgiana
wanless
now
at
last
he
could
declare
that
no
other
love
than
that
which
was
warm
within
his
heart
at
present
could
ever
have
been
possible
to
him
but
he
was
aware
that
he
had
much
to
do
to
recover
his
footing
alice
s
face
and
her
manner
as
she
bade
him
at
the
gate
were
very
clear
before
his
eyes
two
months
passed
by
before
he
was
again
seen
at
beetham
it
had
happened
that
he
was
in
truth
required
elsewhere
on
duty
during
the
period
and
he
took
care
to
let
it
be
known
at
beetham
that
such
was
the
case
information
to
this
effect
was
in
some
shape
sent
to
alice
openly
she
took
no
notice
of
it
but
inwardly
she
said
to
herself
that
they
who
troubled
themselves
by
sending
her
such
tidings
troubled
themselves
in
vain
men
may
come
and
men
may
go
she
sang
to
herself
in
a
low
voice
how
little
they
knew
her
to
come
to
her
with
news
as
to
major
rossiter
s
coming
and
going
then
one
day
he
came
one
morning
early
in
december
the
absolute
fact
was
told
at
the
dinner
table
the
major
is
at
the
parsonage
said
the
dugdale
looked
at
alice
who
continued
however
to
distribute
hashed
mutton
with
an
equanimity
which
betrayed
no
flaw
after
that
not
a
word
was
said
about
him
the
doctor
had
warned
his
wife
to
be
silent
and
though
she
would
fain
have
spoken
she
restrained
herself
after
dinner
the
usual
work
went
on
and
then
the
usual
playing
in
the
garden
the
weather
was
dry
and
mild
for
the
time
of
year
so
that
alice
was
swinging
two
of
the
children
when
major
rossiter
came
up
through
the
gate
minnie
who
had
been
a
favourite
ran
to
him
and
he
came
slowly
across
the
lawn
to
the
tree
on
which
the
swing
was
hung
for
a
moment
alice
stopped
her
work
that
she
might
shake
hands
with
him
and
then
at
once
went
back
to
her
place
if
i
were
to
stop
a
moment
before
bobby
has
had
his
turn
she
said
he
would
feel
the
no
i
isn
t
said
bobby
oo
may
go
is
but
i
don
t
want
to
go
bobby
and
major
rossiter
will
find
mamma
in
the
and
alice
for
a
moment
thought
of
getting
her
hat
and
going
off
from
the
place
then
she
reflected
that
to
run
away
would
be
cowardly
she
did
not
mean
to
run
away
always
because
the
man
came
had
she
not
settled
it
with
herself
that
the
man
should
be
nothing
to
her
then
she
went
on
swinging
the
children
very
deliberately
in
order
that
she
might
be
sure
of
herself
that
the
man
s
coming
had
not
even
flurried
her
in
ten
minutes
the
major
was
there
again
it
had
been
natural
to
suppose
that
he
should
not
be
detained
long
in
conversation
by
dugdale
may
i
swing
one
of
them
for
a
time
he
asked
well
no
i
think
not
it
is
my
allotted
exercise
and
i
never
give
it
but
minnie
who
knew
what
a
strong
arm
could
do
was
imperious
and
the
major
got
possession
of
the
swing
then
of
a
sudden
he
stopped
alice
he
said
i
want
you
to
take
a
turn
with
me
up
the
i
am
not
going
out
at
all
she
said
her
voice
was
steady
and
well
preserved
but
there
was
a
slight
rising
of
colour
on
her
cheeks
but
i
wish
it
expressly
you
must
come
she
could
consider
only
for
a
moment
but
for
a
moment
she
did
think
the
matter
over
if
the
man
chose
to
speak
to
her
seriously
she
must
listen
to
him
once
and
once
only
so
much
he
had
a
right
to
demand
when
a
bird
of
that
kind
pecks
in
that
manner
some
attention
must
be
paid
to
him
so
she
got
her
hat
and
leading
the
way
down
the
road
opened
the
gate
and
turned
up
the
lane
away
from
the
street
of
the
village
for
some
yards
he
did
not
speak
she
indeed
was
the
first
to
do
so
i
can
not
stay
out
very
long
major
rossiter
so
if
there
is
anything
there
is
a
something
of
course
she
knew
but
she
was
quite
resolved
resolved
had
not
every
moment
of
her
life
since
last
she
had
parted
with
him
been
given
up
to
the
strengthening
this
resolution
not
a
stitch
had
gone
through
the
calico
which
had
not
been
pulled
the
tighter
by
the
tightening
of
her
purpose
and
now
he
was
there
oh
how
more
than
earthly
sweet
it
had
been
to
have
him
there
when
her
resolutions
had
been
of
another
kind
but
she
had
been
punished
for
that
and
was
strong
against
such
future
ills
alice
it
had
better
come
out
simply
i
love
you
and
have
ever
loved
you
with
all
my
then
there
was
a
frown
and
a
little
trampling
of
the
ground
beneath
her
feet
but
she
said
not
a
word
oh
if
it
only
could
have
come
sooner
a
few
weeks
sooner
i
know
what
you
would
say
to
me
but
i
would
have
you
listen
to
me
if
possible
before
you
say
it
i
have
given
you
cause
to
be
angry
with
oh
no
she
cried
interrupting
him
but
i
have
never
been
untrue
to
you
for
a
moment
you
seemed
to
slight
and
if
i
did
that
may
pass
if
you
should
slight
me
now
i
must
bear
it
even
though
you
should
deliberately
tell
me
that
you
can
not
love
me
i
must
bear
that
but
with
such
a
load
of
love
as
i
have
at
my
heart
it
must
be
told
to
you
day
and
night
it
covers
me
from
head
to
foot
i
can
think
of
nothing
else
i
dream
that
i
have
your
hand
in
mine
but
when
i
wake
i
think
it
can
never
be
there
was
an
instinct
with
her
at
the
moment
to
let
her
fingers
glide
into
his
but
it
was
shown
only
by
the
gathering
together
of
her
two
hands
so
that
no
rebellious
fingers
straying
from
her
in
that
direction
might
betray
her
if
you
have
never
loved
me
never
can
love
me
say
so
and
i
will
go
she
should
have
spoken
now
upon
the
instant
but
she
simply
moved
her
foot
upon
the
gravel
and
was
silent
that
i
should
be
punished
might
be
right
if
it
could
be
possible
that
the
punishment
should
extend
to
two
that
could
not
be
she
did
not
want
to
punish
him
only
to
be
brave
herself
if
to
be
obdurate
would
in
truth
make
him
unhappy
then
would
it
be
right
that
she
should
still
be
firm
it
would
be
bad
enough
after
so
many
to
succumb
at
the
first
word
but
for
his
sake
for
his
sake
would
it
not
be
possible
to
bear
even
that
if
you
never
have
loved
me
and
never
can
love
me
say
so
and
i
will
even
to
herself
she
had
not
pledged
herself
to
lie
if
he
asked
her
to
be
his
wife
in
the
plain
way
she
could
say
that
she
would
not
then
the
way
would
be
plain
before
her
but
what
reply
was
she
to
make
in
answer
to
such
a
question
as
this
could
she
say
that
she
had
not
loved
him
or
did
not
love
him
alice
he
said
putting
his
hand
up
to
her
arm
no
alice
can
you
not
forgive
me
i
have
and
will
you
not
love
me
she
turned
her
face
upon
him
with
a
purpose
to
frown
but
the
fulness
of
his
eyes
upon
her
was
too
much
and
the
frown
gave
way
and
a
tear
came
into
her
eye
and
her
lips
trembled
and
then
she
acknowledged
to
herself
that
her
resolution
had
not
been
worth
a
straw
to
her
it
should
be
added
that
considerably
before
alice
s
wedding
both
sophia
and
georgiana
wanless
were
married
sophia
in
due
order
as
of
course
to
young
cobble
and
georgiana
to
burmeston
the
brewer
this
as
the
reader
will
remember
was
altogether
unexpected
but
it
was
a
great
and
guiding
principle
with
lady
wanless
that
the
girls
should
not
be
taken
out
of
their
turns
