chapter
i
the
weaving
of
the
shuttle
no
man
knew
when
the
shuttle
began
its
slow
and
heavy
weaving
from
shore
to
shore
that
it
was
held
and
guided
by
the
great
hand
of
fate
fate
alone
saw
the
meaning
of
the
web
it
wove
the
might
of
it
and
its
place
in
the
making
of
a
world
history
men
thought
but
little
of
either
web
or
weaving
calling
them
by
other
names
and
lighter
ones
for
the
time
unconscious
of
the
strength
of
the
thread
thrown
across
thousands
of
miles
of
leaping
heaving
grey
or
blue
ocean
fate
and
life
planned
the
weaving
and
it
seemed
mere
circumstance
which
guided
the
shuttle
to
and
fro
between
two
worlds
divided
by
a
gulf
broader
and
deeper
than
the
thousands
of
miles
of
salt
fierce
sea
the
gulf
of
a
bitter
quarrel
deepened
by
hatred
and
the
shedding
of
brothers
blood
between
the
two
worlds
of
east
and
west
there
was
no
will
to
draw
nearer
each
held
apart
those
who
had
rebelled
against
that
which
their
souls
called
tyranny
having
struggled
madly
and
shed
blood
in
tearing
themselves
free
turned
stern
backs
upon
their
unconquered
enemies
broke
all
cords
that
bound
them
to
the
past
flinging
off
ties
of
name
kinship
and
rank
beginning
with
fierce
disdain
a
new
life
those
who
being
rebelled
against
found
the
rebels
too
passionate
in
their
determination
and
too
desperate
in
their
defence
of
their
strongholds
to
be
less
than
unconquerable
sailed
back
haughtily
to
the
world
which
seemed
so
far
the
greater
power
plunging
into
new
battles
they
added
new
conquests
and
splendour
to
their
land
looking
back
with
something
of
contempt
to
the
west
left
to
build
its
own
civilisation
without
other
aid
than
the
strength
of
its
own
strong
right
hand
and
strong
uncultured
brain
but
while
the
two
worlds
held
apart
the
shuttle
weaving
slowly
in
the
great
hand
of
fate
drew
them
closer
and
held
them
firm
each
of
them
all
unknowing
for
many
a
year
that
what
had
at
first
been
mere
threads
of
gossamer
was
forming
a
web
whose
strength
in
time
none
could
compute
whose
severance
could
be
accomplished
but
by
tragedy
and
convulsion
the
weaving
was
but
in
its
early
and
years
when
this
story
opens
steamers
crossed
and
recrossed
the
atlantic
but
they
accomplished
the
journey
at
leisure
and
with
heavy
rollings
and
all
such
discomforts
as
small
craft
can
afford
their
staterooms
and
decks
were
not
crowded
with
people
to
whom
the
voyage
was
a
mere
incident
in
many
cases
a
yearly
one
a
crossing
in
those
days
was
an
event
it
was
planned
seriously
long
thought
of
discussed
and
with
and
among
the
various
members
of
the
family
to
which
the
voyager
belonged
a
certain
boldness
bordering
on
recklessness
was
almost
to
be
presupposed
in
the
individual
who
turning
his
back
upon
new
york
philadelphia
boston
and
like
cities
turned
his
face
towards
in
those
days
when
the
shuttle
wove
at
leisure
a
man
did
not
lightly
run
over
to
london
or
paris
or
berlin
he
gravely
went
to
the
journey
being
likely
to
be
made
once
in
a
lifetime
the
intention
was
to
see
as
much
as
possible
to
visit
as
many
cities
cathedrals
ruins
galleries
as
his
time
and
purse
would
allow
people
who
could
speak
with
any
degree
of
familiarity
of
hyde
park
the
champs
elysees
the
pincio
had
gained
a
certain
dignity
the
ability
to
touch
with
an
intimate
bearing
upon
such
localities
was
a
raison
de
plus
for
being
asked
out
to
tea
or
to
dinner
to
possess
photographs
and
relics
was
to
be
of
interest
to
have
seen
european
celebrities
even
at
a
distance
to
have
wandered
about
the
outside
of
poets
gardens
and
philosophers
houses
was
to
be
entitled
to
respect
the
period
was
a
far
cry
from
the
time
when
the
shuttle
having
shot
to
and
fro
faster
and
faster
week
by
week
month
by
month
weaving
new
threads
into
its
web
each
year
has
woven
warp
and
woof
until
they
bind
far
shore
to
shore
it
was
in
comparatively
early
days
that
the
first
thread
we
follow
was
woven
into
the
web
many
such
have
been
woven
since
and
have
added
greater
strength
than
any
others
twining
the
cord
of
sex
and
and
but
this
was
a
slight
and
weak
one
being
only
the
thread
of
the
life
of
one
of
reuben
daughters
the
pretty
little
simple
one
whose
name
was
rosalie
they
were
the
vanderpoels
of
the
americans
whose
fortunes
were
a
portion
of
the
history
of
their
country
the
building
of
these
fortunes
had
been
a
part
of
or
had
created
epochs
and
crises
their
millions
could
scarcely
be
regarded
as
private
property
newspapers
bandied
them
about
so
to
speak
employing
them
as
factors
in
argument
using
them
as
figures
of
speech
incorporating
them
into
methods
of
calculation
literature
touched
upon
them
moral
systems
considered
them
stories
for
the
young
treated
them
gravely
as
illustrative
the
first
reuben
vanderpoel
who
in
early
days
of
danger
had
traded
with
savages
for
the
pelts
of
wild
animals
was
the
lauded
hero
of
stories
of
thrift
and
enterprise
throughout
his
life
he
had
been
irresistibly
impelled
to
action
by
an
absolute
genius
of
commerce
expressing
itself
at
the
outset
by
the
exhibition
of
courage
in
mere
exchange
and
barter
an
alert
power
to
perceive
the
potential
value
of
things
and
the
possible
malleability
of
men
and
circumstances
had
stood
him
in
marvellous
good
stead
he
had
bought
at
low
prices
things
which
in
the
eyes
of
the
less
discerning
were
worthless
but
having
obtained
possession
of
such
things
the
less
discerning
had
almost
invariably
awakened
to
the
fact
that
in
his
hands
values
increased
and
methods
of
remunerative
disposition
being
sought
were
found
nothing
remained
unutilisable
the
practical
sordid
uneducated
little
man
developed
the
power
to
create
demand
for
his
own
supplies
if
he
was
betrayed
into
an
error
he
quickly
retrieved
it
he
could
live
upon
nothing
and
consequently
could
travel
anywhere
in
search
of
such
things
as
he
desired
he
could
barely
read
and
write
and
could
not
spell
but
he
was
daring
and
astute
his
untaught
brain
was
that
of
a
financier
his
blood
burned
with
the
fever
of
but
one
desire
the
desire
to
accumulate
money
expressed
to
his
nature
not
expenditure
but
investment
in
such
small
or
large
properties
as
could
be
resold
at
profit
in
the
near
or
far
future
the
future
held
fascinations
for
him
he
bought
nothing
for
his
own
pleasure
or
comfort
nothing
which
could
not
be
sold
or
bartered
again
he
married
a
woman
who
was
a
trader
daughter
and
shared
his
passion
for
gain
she
was
of
north
of
england
blood
her
father
having
been
a
small
tradesman
in
an
unimportant
town
who
had
been
daring
enough
to
emigrate
when
emigration
meant
the
facing
of
unknown
dangers
in
a
land
she
had
excited
reuben
admiration
by
taking
off
her
petticoat
one
bitter
winter
day
to
sell
it
to
a
squaw
in
exchange
for
an
ornament
for
which
she
chanced
to
know
another
squaw
would
pay
with
a
skin
of
value
the
first
vanderpoel
was
as
wonderful
as
her
husband
they
were
both
wonderful
they
were
the
founders
of
the
fortune
which
a
century
and
a
half
later
was
the
delight
in
fact
the
piece
de
resistance
of
new
york
society
reporters
its
enormity
being
restated
in
round
figures
when
a
blank
space
must
be
filled
up
the
method
of
statement
lent
itself
to
infinite
variety
and
was
always
interesting
to
a
particular
class
some
elements
of
which
felt
it
encouraging
to
be
assured
that
so
much
money
could
be
a
personal
possession
some
elements
feeling
the
fact
an
additional
argument
to
be
used
against
the
infamy
of
monopoly
the
first
reuben
vanderpoel
transmitted
to
his
son
his
accumulations
and
his
fever
for
gain
he
had
but
one
child
the
second
reuben
built
upon
the
foundations
this
afforded
him
a
fortune
as
much
larger
than
the
first
as
the
rapid
growth
and
increasing
capabilities
of
the
country
gave
him
enlarging
opportunities
to
acquire
it
was
no
longer
necessary
to
deal
with
savages
his
powers
were
called
upon
to
cope
with
those
of
white
men
who
came
to
a
new
country
to
struggle
for
livelihood
and
fortune
some
were
shrewd
some
were
desperate
some
were
dishonest
but
shrewdness
never
outwitted
desperation
never
overcame
dishonesty
never
deceived
the
second
reuben
vanderpoel
each
characteristic
ended
by
adapting
itself
to
his
own
purposes
and
qualities
and
as
a
result
of
each
it
was
he
who
in
any
business
transaction
was
the
gainer
it
was
the
common
saying
that
the
vanderpoels
were
possessed
of
a
spell
their
spell
lay
in
their
entire
mental
and
physical
absorption
in
one
idea
their
peculiarity
was
not
so
much
that
they
wished
to
be
rich
as
that
nature
itself
impelled
them
to
collect
wealth
as
the
draws
towards
it
iron
having
possessed
nothing
they
became
rich
having
become
rich
they
became
richer
having
founded
their
fortunes
on
small
schemes
they
increased
them
by
enormous
ones
in
time
they
attained
that
omnipotence
of
wealth
which
it
would
seem
no
circumstance
can
control
or
limit
the
first
reuben
vanderpoel
could
not
spell
the
second
could
the
third
was
as
well
educated
as
a
man
could
be
whose
sole
profession
is
his
children
were
taught
all
that
expensive
teachers
and
expensive
opportunities
could
teach
them
after
the
second
generation
the
meagre
and
mercantile
physical
type
of
the
vanderpoels
improved
upon
itself
feminine
good
looks
appeared
and
were
made
the
most
of
the
vanderpoel
element
invested
even
good
looks
to
an
advantage
the
fourth
reuben
vanderpoel
had
no
son
and
two
daughters
they
were
brought
up
in
a
mansion
built
upon
a
fashionable
new
york
thoroughfare
roaring
with
traffic
to
the
farthest
point
of
the
rocky
mountains
the
number
of
dollars
this
mansion
it
was
always
called
so
had
cost
was
known
there
may
have
existed
pueblo
indians
who
had
heard
rumours
of
the
price
of
it
all
the
and
farmers
in
the
united
states
had
read
newspaper
descriptions
of
its
furnishings
and
knew
the
value
of
the
brocade
which
hung
in
the
bedrooms
and
boudoirs
of
the
misses
vanderpoel
it
was
a
fact
much
cherished
that
miss
rosalie
bath
was
of
carrara
marble
and
to
good
souls
actively
engaged
in
doing
their
own
washing
in
small
new
england
or
western
towns
it
was
a
distinct
luxury
to
be
aware
that
the
water
in
the
carrara
marble
bath
was
perfumed
with
florentine
iris
circumstances
such
as
these
seemed
to
become
personal
possessions
and
even
to
lighten
somewhat
the
burden
of
toil
rosalie
vanderpoel
married
an
englishman
of
title
and
part
of
the
story
of
her
married
life
forms
my
prologue
hers
was
of
the
early
international
marriages
and
the
republican
mind
had
not
yet
adjusted
itself
to
all
that
such
alliances
might
imply
it
was
yet
ingenuous
imaginative
and
confiding
in
such
matters
a
baronetcy
and
a
manor
house
reigning
over
an
old
english
village
and
over
villagers
in
possible
smock
frocks
presented
elements
of
picturesque
dignity
to
people
whose
intimacy
with
such
allurements
had
been
limited
by
the
novels
of
oliphant
and
other
writers
the
most
ordinary
little
anecdotes
in
which
vicarages
gamekeepers
and
dowagers
figured
were
exciting
in
these
early
days
sir
nigel
anstruthers
when
engraved
upon
a
visiting
card
wore
an
air
of
distinction
almost
startling
sir
nigel
himself
was
not
as
picturesque
as
his
name
though
he
was
not
entirely
without
attraction
when
for
reasons
of
his
own
he
chose
to
aim
at
agreeableness
of
bearing
he
was
a
man
with
a
good
figure
and
a
good
voice
and
but
for
a
heaviness
of
feature
the
result
of
objectionable
living
might
have
given
the
impression
of
being
better
looking
than
he
really
was
new
york
laid
amused
and
at
the
same
time
charmed
stress
upon
the
fact
that
he
spoke
with
an
english
his
enunciation
was
in
fact
clear
cut
and
treated
its
vowels
well
he
was
a
man
who
observed
with
an
air
of
accustomed
punctiliousness
such
social
rules
and
courtesies
as
he
deemed
it
expedient
to
consider
an
astute
worldling
had
remarked
that
he
was
at
once
more
ceremonious
and
more
casual
in
his
manner
than
men
bred
in
america
if
you
invite
him
to
dinner
the
wording
said
or
if
you
die
or
marry
or
meet
with
an
accident
his
notes
of
condolence
or
congratulation
are
prompt
and
civil
but
the
actual
truth
is
that
he
cares
nothing
whatever
about
you
or
your
relations
and
if
you
please
him
he
does
not
hesitate
to
sulk
or
be
astonishingly
rude
which
last
an
american
does
not
allow
himself
to
be
as
a
by
many
people
sir
nigel
was
not
analysed
but
accepted
he
was
of
the
early
english
who
came
to
new
york
and
was
a
novelty
of
interest
with
his
background
of
manor
house
and
village
and
old
family
name
he
was
very
much
talked
of
at
vivacious
ladies
luncheon
parties
he
was
very
much
talked
to
at
equally
vivacious
afternoon
teas
at
dinner
parties
he
was
furtively
watched
a
good
deal
but
after
dinner
when
he
sat
with
the
men
over
their
wine
he
was
not
popular
he
was
not
perhaps
exactly
disliked
but
men
whose
chief
interest
at
that
period
lay
in
stocks
and
railroads
did
not
find
conversation
easy
with
a
man
whose
sole
occupation
had
been
the
shooting
of
birds
and
the
hunting
of
foxes
when
he
was
not
absolutely
loitering
about
london
with
his
time
on
his
hands
the
stories
he
told
and
they
were
few
were
chiefly
anecdotes
whose
points
gained
their
humour
by
the
fact
that
a
man
was
a
comically
bad
shot
or
bad
rider
and
either
peppered
a
gamekeeper
or
was
thrown
into
a
ditch
when
his
horse
went
over
a
hedge
and
such
relations
did
not
increase
in
the
poignancy
of
their
interest
by
being
filtered
through
brains
accustomed
to
applying
their
powers
to
problems
of
speculation
and
commerce
he
was
not
so
dull
but
that
he
perceived
this
at
an
early
stage
of
his
visit
to
new
york
which
was
probably
the
reason
of
the
infrequency
of
his
stories
he
on
his
side
was
naturally
not
quick
to
rise
to
the
humour
of
a
big
deal
or
a
big
blunder
made
on
wall
street
or
to
the
wit
of
jokes
concerning
them
upon
the
whole
he
would
have
been
glad
to
have
understood
such
matters
more
clearly
his
circumstances
were
such
as
had
at
last
forced
him
to
contemplate
the
world
of
with
something
of
an
annoyed
respect
these
fellows
who
had
neither
titles
nor
estates
to
keep
up
could
make
money
he
as
he
acknowledged
disgustedly
to
himself
was
much
worse
than
a
beggar
there
was
stornham
court
in
a
state
of
ruin
the
estate
going
to
the
dogs
the
farmhouses
tumbling
to
pieces
and
he
so
to
speak
without
a
sixpence
to
bless
himself
with
and
head
over
heels
in
debt
englishmen
of
the
rank
which
in
bygone
times
had
not
associated
itself
with
trade
had
begun
at
least
to
trifle
with
it
to
consider
its
potentialities
as
factors
possibly
to
be
made
useful
by
the
aristocracy
countesses
had
not
yet
spiritedly
opened
milliners
shops
nor
belted
earls
adorned
the
stage
but
certain
noblemen
had
dallied
with
beer
and
coquetted
with
stocks
one
of
the
first
commercial
developments
had
been
the
discovery
of
america
particularly
of
new
york
as
a
place
where
if
one
could
make
up
one
mind
to
the
plunge
one
might
marry
one
sons
profitably
at
the
outset
it
presented
a
field
so
promising
as
to
lead
to
rashness
and
indiscretion
on
the
part
of
persons
not
given
to
analysis
of
character
and
in
consequence
relying
too
serenely
upon
an
ingenuousness
which
rather
speedily
revealed
that
it
had
its
limits
ingenuousness
combining
itself
with
remarkable
alertness
of
perception
on
occasion
is
rather
american
than
english
and
is
therefore
to
the
english
mind
misleading
at
first
younger
sons
who
gave
trouble
to
their
families
were
sent
out
their
names
their
backgrounds
of
castles
or
manors
relatives
of
distinction
london
seasons
fox
hunting
buckingham
palace
and
goodwood
races
formed
a
picturesque
allurement
that
the
castles
and
manors
would
belong
to
their
elder
brothers
that
the
relatives
of
distinction
did
not
encourage
intimacy
with
swarms
of
the
younger
branches
of
their
families
that
london
seasons
hunting
and
racing
were
for
their
elders
and
betters
were
facts
not
realised
in
all
their
importance
by
the
republican
mind
in
the
course
of
time
they
were
realised
to
the
full
but
in
rosalie
vanderpoel
nineteenth
year
they
covered
what
was
at
that
time
almost
unknown
territory
one
may
rest
assured
sir
nigel
anstruthers
said
nothing
whatsoever
in
new
york
of
an
interview
he
had
had
before
sailing
with
an
intensely
disagreeable
who
was
the
wife
of
a
bishop
she
was
a
horrible
old
woman
with
a
broad
face
blunt
features
and
a
raucous
voice
whose
tones
added
acridity
to
her
observations
when
she
was
indulging
in
her
favourite
pastime
of
interfering
with
the
business
of
her
acquaintances
and
relations
i
do
not
know
what
you
are
going
chasing
off
to
america
for
nigel
she
commented
you
ca
afford
it
and
it
is
perfectly
ridiculous
of
you
to
take
it
upon
yourself
to
travel
for
pleasure
as
if
you
were
a
man
of
means
instead
of
being
in
such
a
state
of
pocket
that
maria
tells
me
you
can
not
pay
your
tailor
neither
the
bishop
nor
i
can
do
anything
for
you
and
i
hope
you
do
expect
it
all
i
can
hope
is
that
you
know
yourself
what
you
are
going
to
america
in
search
of
and
that
it
is
something
more
practical
than
buffaloes
you
had
better
stop
in
new
york
those
big
shopkeepers
daughters
are
enormously
rich
they
say
and
they
are
immensely
pleased
by
attentions
from
men
of
your
class
they
say
they
marry
anything
if
it
has
an
aunt
or
a
grandmother
with
a
title
you
can
mention
the
marchioness
you
know
you
need
not
refer
to
the
fact
that
she
thought
your
father
a
blackguard
and
your
mother
an
interloper
and
that
you
have
never
been
invited
to
broadmere
since
you
were
born
you
can
refer
casually
to
me
and
to
the
bishop
and
to
the
palace
too
a
palace
even
a
bishop
ought
to
go
a
long
way
with
americans
they
will
think
it
is
something
she
ended
her
remarks
with
one
of
her
most
insulting
snorts
of
laughter
and
sir
nigel
became
dark
red
and
looked
as
if
he
would
like
to
knock
her
down
it
was
not
however
her
sentiments
which
were
particularly
revolting
to
him
if
she
had
expressed
them
in
a
manner
more
flattering
to
himself
he
would
have
felt
that
there
was
a
good
deal
to
be
said
for
them
in
fact
he
had
put
the
same
thing
to
himself
some
time
previously
and
in
summing
up
the
american
matter
had
reached
certain
thrifty
decisions
the
impulse
to
knock
her
down
surged
within
him
solely
because
he
had
a
brutally
bad
temper
when
his
vanity
was
insulted
and
he
was
furious
at
her
impudence
in
speaking
to
him
as
if
he
were
a
villager
out
of
work
whom
she
was
at
liberty
to
bully
and
lecture
for
a
woman
who
is
supposed
to
have
been
born
of
gentle
people
he
said
to
his
mother
afterwards
aunt
marian
is
the
most
vulgar
old
beast
i
have
ever
beheld
she
has
the
taste
of
a
female
which
was
entirely
true
but
it
might
be
added
that
his
own
was
no
better
and
his
points
of
view
and
morals
wholly
coincided
with
his
taste
naturally
rosalie
vanderpoel
knew
nothing
of
this
side
of
the
matter
she
had
been
a
petted
butterfly
child
who
had
been
pretty
and
admired
and
indulged
from
her
infancy
she
had
grown
up
into
a
petted
butterfly
girl
pretty
and
admired
and
surrounded
by
inordinate
luxury
her
world
had
been
made
up
of
lavish
friends
and
relations
who
enjoyed
themselves
and
felt
a
delight
in
her
girlish
toilettes
and
triumphs
she
had
spent
her
one
season
of
belledom
in
being
whirled
from
festivity
to
festivity
in
dancing
in
rooms
festooned
with
thousands
of
dollars
worth
of
flowers
in
lunching
or
dining
at
tables
loaded
with
roses
and
violets
and
orchids
from
which
ballrooms
or
feasts
she
had
borne
away
wonderful
favours
and
gifts
whose
prices
being
recorded
in
the
newspapers
caused
a
thrill
of
delight
or
envy
to
pass
over
the
land
she
was
a
slim
little
creature
with
quantities
of
light
feathery
hair
like
a
french
doll
she
had
small
hands
and
small
feet
and
a
small
waist
a
small
brain
also
it
must
be
admitted
but
she
was
an
innocent
girl
with
a
childlike
simpleness
of
mind
in
fine
she
was
exactly
the
girl
to
find
sir
nigel
domineering
temperament
at
once
imposing
and
attractive
so
long
as
it
was
cloaked
by
the
ceremonies
of
external
good
breeding
her
sister
bettina
who
was
still
a
child
was
of
a
stronger
and
less
susceptible
nature
betty
at
eight
had
long
legs
and
a
square
but
delicate
small
face
her
eyes
were
noticeable
for
rather
extravagant
lashes
and
a
straight
young
stare
which
seemed
to
accuse
if
not
to
condemn
she
was
being
educated
at
a
ruinously
expensive
school
with
a
number
of
other
inordinately
rich
little
girls
who
were
all
too
wonderfully
dressed
and
too
lavishly
supplied
with
pocket
money
the
school
considered
itself
especially
refined
and
select
but
was
in
fact
interestingly
vulgar
the
inordinately
rich
little
girls
who
had
most
of
them
pretty
and
spiritual
or
pretty
and
piquant
faces
ate
a
great
many
bon
bons
and
chattered
a
great
deal
in
high
unmodulated
voices
about
the
parties
their
sisters
and
other
relatives
went
to
and
the
dresses
they
wore
some
of
them
were
nice
little
souls
who
in
the
future
would
emerge
from
their
chrysalis
state
enchanting
women
but
they
used
colloquialisms
freely
and
had
an
ingenuous
habit
of
referring
to
the
prices
of
things
bettina
vanderpoel
who
was
the
richest
and
cleverest
and
most
promisingly
handsome
among
them
was
colloquial
to
slanginess
but
she
had
a
deep
mellow
child
voice
and
an
amazing
carriage
she
could
not
endure
sir
nigel
anstruthers
and
being
an
american
child
did
not
hesitate
to
express
herself
with
force
if
with
some
crudeness
he
a
hateful
thing
she
said
i
loathe
him
he
stuck
up
and
he
thinks
you
are
afraid
of
him
and
he
likes
sir
nigel
had
known
only
english
children
little
girls
who
lived
in
that
discreet
corner
of
their
parents
town
or
country
houses
known
as
the
schoolroom
apparently
emerging
only
for
daily
walks
with
governesses
girls
with
long
hair
and
boys
in
little
high
hats
and
with
faces
which
seemed
curiously
made
to
match
them
both
boys
and
girls
were
decently
kept
out
of
the
way
and
not
in
the
least
dwelt
on
except
when
brought
out
for
inspection
during
the
holidays
and
taken
to
the
pantomime
sir
nigel
had
not
realised
that
an
american
child
was
an
absolute
factor
to
be
counted
with
and
a
youngster
who
entered
the
when
she
chose
and
joined
fearlessly
in
adult
conversation
was
an
element
he
considered
annoying
it
was
quite
true
that
bettina
talked
too
much
and
too
readily
at
times
but
it
had
not
been
explained
to
her
that
the
opinions
of
eight
years
are
not
always
of
absorbing
interest
to
the
mature
it
was
also
true
that
sir
nigel
was
a
great
fool
for
interfering
with
what
was
clearly
no
affair
of
his
in
such
a
manner
as
would
have
made
him
an
enemy
even
had
not
the
child
instinct
arrayed
her
against
him
at
the
outset
you
american
youngsters
are
too
cheeky
he
said
on
one
of
the
occasions
when
betty
had
talked
too
much
if
you
were
my
sister
and
lived
at
stornham
court
you
would
be
learning
lessons
in
the
schoolroom
and
wearing
a
pinafore
nobody
ever
saw
my
sister
emily
when
she
was
your
well
i
not
your
sister
emily
retorted
betty
and
i
guess
i
glad
of
it
was
rather
impudent
of
her
but
it
must
be
confessed
that
she
was
not
infrequently
rather
impudent
in
a
rude
way
but
she
was
serenely
unconscious
of
the
fact
sir
nigel
flushed
darkly
and
laughed
a
short
unpleasant
laugh
if
she
had
been
his
sister
emily
she
would
have
fared
ill
at
the
moment
for
his
villainous
temper
would
have
got
the
better
of
him
i
that
i
may
be
congratulated
too
he
sneered
if
i
was
going
to
be
anybody
sister
emily
said
betty
excited
a
little
by
the
sense
of
the
fray
i
should
want
to
be
now
betty
do
be
hateful
interposed
rosalie
laughing
and
her
laugh
was
nervous
there
mina
thalberg
coming
up
the
front
steps
go
and
meet
rosalie
poor
girl
always
found
herself
nervous
when
sir
nigel
and
betty
were
in
the
room
together
she
instinctively
recognised
their
antagonism
and
was
afraid
betty
would
do
something
an
english
baronet
would
think
vulgar
her
simple
brain
could
not
have
explained
to
her
why
it
was
that
she
knew
sir
nigel
often
thought
new
yorkers
vulgar
she
was
however
quite
aware
of
this
but
imperfectly
concealed
fact
and
felt
a
timid
desire
to
be
explanatory
when
bettina
marched
out
of
the
room
with
her
extraordinary
carriage
finely
manifest
rosy
little
laugh
was
propitiatory
you
must
mind
her
she
said
she
a
real
splendid
little
thing
but
she
got
a
quick
temper
it
all
over
in
a
they
would
stand
that
sort
of
thing
in
england
said
sir
nigel
she
deucedly
spoiled
you
he
detested
the
child
he
disliked
all
children
but
this
one
awakened
in
him
more
than
mere
dislike
the
fact
was
that
though
betty
herself
was
wholly
unconscious
of
the
subtle
truth
the
as
yet
undeveloped
intellect
which
later
made
her
a
brilliant
and
captivating
personality
vaguely
saw
him
as
he
was
an
unscrupulous
sordid
brute
as
remorseless
an
adventurer
and
swindler
in
his
special
line
as
if
he
had
been
engaged
in
drawing
false
cheques
and
arranging
huge
jewel
robberies
instead
of
planning
to
entrap
into
a
disadvantageous
marriage
a
girl
whose
gentleness
and
fortune
could
be
used
by
a
blackguard
of
reputable
name
the
man
was
enough
to
see
that
her
gentle
weakness
was
of
value
because
it
could
be
bullied
her
money
was
to
be
counted
on
because
it
could
be
spent
on
himself
and
his
degenerate
vices
and
on
his
racked
and
ruined
name
and
estate
which
must
be
rebuilt
and
restocked
at
an
early
date
by
someone
or
other
lest
they
tumbled
into
ignominious
collapse
which
could
not
be
concealed
bettina
of
the
accusing
eyes
did
not
know
that
in
the
depth
of
her
yet
crude
young
being
instinct
was
summing
up
for
her
the
potentialities
of
an
unusually
fine
specimen
of
the
british
blackguard
but
this
was
nevertheless
the
interesting
truth
when
later
she
was
told
that
her
sister
had
become
engaged
to
sir
nigel
anstruthers
a
flame
of
colour
flashed
over
her
face
she
stared
silently
a
moment
then
bit
her
lip
and
burst
into
tears
well
bett
exclaimed
rosalie
you
are
the
queerest
thing
i
ever
bettina
tears
were
an
outburst
not
a
flow
she
swept
them
away
passionately
with
her
small
handkerchief
he
do
something
awful
to
you
she
said
he
nearly
kill
you
i
know
he
will
i
rather
be
dead
she
dashed
out
of
the
room
and
could
never
be
induced
to
say
a
word
further
about
the
matter
she
would
indeed
have
found
it
impossible
to
express
her
intense
antipathy
and
sense
of
impending
calamity
she
had
not
the
phrases
to
make
herself
clear

to
herself

controlling

chapter
ii
a
lack
of
perception
mercantile
as
americans
were
proclaimed
to
be
the
opinion
of
sir
nigel
anstruthers
was
that
they
were
on
some
points
singularly
unbusinesslike
in
the
perfectly
obvious
and
simple
matter
of
the
settlement
of
his
daughter
fortune
he
had
felt
that
reuben
vanderpoel
was
obtuse
to
the
point
of
idiocy
he
seemed
to
have
none
of
the
ordinary
points
of
view
naturally
there
was
to
anstruthers
mind
but
one
point
of
view
to
take
a
man
of
birth
and
rank
he
argued
does
not
career
across
the
atlantic
to
marry
a
new
york
millionaire
daughter
unless
he
anticipates
deriving
some
advantage
from
the
alliance
such
a
man
being
of
anstruthers
type
would
not
have
married
a
rich
woman
even
in
his
own
country
with
out
making
sure
that
advantages
were
to
accrue
to
himself
as
a
result
of
the
union
in
england
to
use
his
own
words
there
was
no
nonsense
about
women
fortunes
as
well
as
themselves
belonged
to
their
husbands
and
a
man
who
was
master
in
his
own
house
could
make
his
wife
do
as
he
chose
he
had
seen
girls
with
money
managed
very
satisfactorily
by
fellows
who
held
a
tight
rein
and
were
not
moved
by
tears
and
did
not
allow
talking
to
relations
if
he
had
been
desirous
of
marrying
and
could
have
afforded
to
take
a
penniless
wife
there
were
hundreds
of
portionless
girls
ready
to
thank
god
for
a
decent
chance
to
settle
themselves
for
life
and
one
need
not
stir
out
of
one
native
land
to
find
them
but
sir
nigel
had
not
in
the
least
desired
to
saddle
himself
with
a
domestic
encumbrance
in
fact
nothing
would
have
induced
him
to
consider
the
step
if
he
had
not
been
driven
hard
by
circumstances
his
fortunes
had
reached
a
stage
where
money
must
be
forthcoming
somehow
from
somewhere
he
and
his
mother
had
been
living
from
hand
to
mouth
so
to
speak
for
years
and
they
had
also
been
obliged
to
keep
up
appearances
which
is
sometimes
embittering
even
to
persons
of
amiable
tempers
lady
anstruthers
it
is
true
had
lived
in
the
country
in
as
niggardly
a
manner
as
possible
she
had
narrowed
her
existence
to
absolute
privation
presenting
at
the
same
time
a
stern
bold
front
to
the
persons
who
saw
her
to
the
insufficient
staff
of
servants
to
the
village
to
the
vicar
and
his
wife
and
the
few
neighbours
who
perhaps
once
a
year
drove
miles
to
call
or
leave
a
card
she
was
an
old
woman
sufficiently
unattractive
to
find
no
difficulty
in
the
way
of
limiting
her
acquaintances
the
unprepossessing
wardrobe
she
had
gathered
in
the
passing
years
was
remade
again
and
again
by
the
village
dressmaker
she
wore
dingy
old
silk
gowns
and
appalling
bonnets
and
mantles
dripping
with
rusty
fringes
and
bugle
beads
but
these
mitigated
not
in
the
least
the
unflinching
arrogance
of
her
bearing
or
the
simple
intolerant
rudeness
which
she
considered
proper
and
becoming
in
persons
like
herself
she
did
not
of
course
allow
that
there
existed
many
persons
like
herself
that
society
rejoiced
in
this
fact
was
but
the
stamp
of
its
inferiority
and
folly
while
she
pinched
herself
and
harried
her
few
hirelings
at
stornham
it
was
necessary
for
sir
nigel
to
show
himself
in
town
and
present
as
decent
an
appearance
as
possible
his
vanity
was
far
too
arrogant
to
allow
of
his
permitting
himself
to
drop
out
of
the
world
to
which
he
could
not
afford
to
belong
that
he
should
have
been
forgotten
or
ignored
would
have
been
intolerable
to
him
for
a
few
years
he
was
invited
to
dine
at
good
houses
and
got
shooting
and
hunting
as
part
of
the
hospitality
of
his
acquaintances
but
a
man
who
can
not
afford
to
return
hospitalities
will
find
that
he
need
not
expect
to
avail
himself
of
those
of
his
acquaintances
to
the
end
of
his
career
unless
he
is
an
extremely
engaging
person
sir
nigel
anstruthers
was
not
an
engaging
person
he
never
gave
a
thought
to
the
comfort
or
interest
of
any
other
human
being
than
himself
he
was
also
dominated
by
the
kind
of
nasty
temper
which
so
reveals
itself
when
let
loose
that
its
owner
can
not
control
it
even
when
it
would
be
distinctly
to
his
advantage
to
do
so
finding
that
he
had
nothing
to
give
in
return
for
what
he
took
as
if
it
were
his
right
society
gradually
began
to
cease
to
retain
any
lively
recollection
of
his
existence
the
tradespeople
he
had
borne
himself
loftily
towards
awakened
to
the
fact
that
he
was
the
kind
of
man
it
was
at
once
safe
and
wise
to
dun
and
therefore
proceeded
to
make
his
life
a
burden
to
him
at
his
clubs
he
had
never
been
a
member
surrounded
and
rejoiced
over
when
he
made
his
appearance
the
time
came
when
he
began
to
fancy
that
he
was
rather
edged
away
from
and
he
endeavoured
to
sustain
his
dignity
by
being
sulky
and
making
caustic
speeches
when
he
was
approached
driven
occasionally
down
to
stornham
by
actual
pressure
of
circumstances
he
found
the
outlook
there
more
embittering
still
lady
anstruthers
laid
the
bareness
of
the
land
before
him
without
any
effort
to
palliate
unpleasantness
if
he
chose
to
stalk
about
and
look
glum
she
could
sit
still
and
call
his
attention
to
revolting
truths
which
he
could
not
deny
she
could
point
out
to
him
that
he
had
no
money
and
that
tenants
would
not
stay
in
houses
which
were
tumbling
to
pieces
and
work
land
which
had
been
starved
she
could
tell
him
just
how
long
a
time
had
elapsed
since
wages
had
been
paid
and
accounts
cleared
off
and
she
had
an
engaging
unbiassed
way
of
seeming
to
drive
these
maddening
details
home
by
the
mere
manner
of
her
statement
you
make
the
whole
thing
as
damned
disagreeable
as
you
can
nigel
would
snarl
i
merely
state
facts
she
would
reply
with
acrid
serenity
a
man
who
can
not
keep
up
his
estate
pay
his
tailor
or
the
rent
of
his
lodgings
in
town
is
in
a
strait
which
may
drive
him
to
desperation
sir
nigel
anstruthers
borrowed
some
money
went
to
new
york
and
made
his
suit
to
nice
little
silly
rosalie
vanderpoel
but
the
whole
thing
was
unexpectedly
disappointing
and
surrounded
by
irritating
circumstances
he
found
himself
face
to
face
with
a
state
of
affairs
such
as
he
had
not
contemplated
in
england
when
a
man
married
certain
practical
matters
could
be
inquired
into
and
arranged
by
solicitors
the
amount
of
the
prospective
bride
fortune
the
allowances
and
settlements
to
be
made
the
position
of
the
bridegroom
with
regard
to
pecuniary
matters
to
put
it
simply
a
man
found
out
where
he
stood
and
what
he
was
to
gain
but
at
first
to
his
sardonic
entertainment
and
later
to
his
disgusted
annoyance
sir
nigel
gradually
discovered
that
in
the
matter
of
marriage
americans
had
an
ingenuous
tendency
to
believe
in
the
sentimental
feelings
of
the
parties
concerned
the
general
impression
seemed
to
be
that
a
man
married
purely
for
love
and
that
delicacy
would
make
it
impossible
for
him
to
ask
questions
as
to
what
his
bride
parents
were
in
a
position
to
hand
over
to
him
as
a
sort
of
indemnity
for
the
loss
of
his
bachelor
freedom
anstruthers
began
to
discover
this
fact
before
he
had
been
many
weeks
in
new
york
he
reached
the
realisation
of
its
existence
by
processes
of
exclusion
and
inclusion
by
hearing
casual
remarks
people
let
drop
by
asking
roundabout
and
careful
questions
by
leading
both
men
and
women
to
the
innocent
expounding
of
certain
points
of
view
millionaires
it
appeared
did
not
expect
to
make
allowances
to
men
who
married
their
daughters
young
women
it
transpired
did
not
in
the
least
realise
that
a
man
should
be
liberally
endowed
in
payment
for
assuming
the
duties
of
a
husband
if
rich
fathers
made
allowances
they
made
them
to
their
daughters
themselves
who
disposed
of
them
as
they
pleased
in
this
case
of
course
sir
nigel
privately
argued
with
fine
acumen
it
became
the
husband
business
to
see
that
what
his
wife
pleased
should
be
what
most
agreeably
coincided
with
his
own
views
and
conveniences
his
most
illuminating
experience
had
been
the
hearing
of
some
men
rich
stockbrokers
with
a
vulgar
sense
of
humour
enjoying
themselves
quite
uproariously
one
night
at
a
club
over
a
story
one
of
them
was
relating
of
an
unsatisfactory
german
who
had
demanded
an
income
he
was
a
man
of
small
title
who
had
married
the
narrator
daughter
and
after
some
months
spent
in
his
house
had
felt
it
but
proper
that
his
financial
position
should
be
put
on
a
practical
footing
he
brought
her
back
after
the
bridal
tour
to
make
us
a
visit
said
the
storyteller
a
man
with
a
quaint
wry
mouth
which
seemed
to
express
a
perpetual
repressed
appreciation
of
passing
events
i
had
nothing
to
say
against
that
because
we
were
all
glad
to
see
her
home
and
her
mother
had
been
missing
her
but
weeks
passed
and
months
passed
and
there
was
no
mention
made
of
them
going
over
to
settle
in
the
slosh
we
heard
so
much
of
and
in
time
it
came
out
that
the
slosh
thing
anstruthers
realised
with
gall
in
his
soul
that
the
brute
as
he
called
him
meant
schloss
and
that
his
mispronunciation
was
at
once
a
matter
of
humour
and
derision
was
his
at
all
it
was
his
elder
brother
the
whole
lot
of
them
were
counts
and
not
one
of
them
seemed
to
own
a
dime
the
slosh
count
had
more
than
cents
and
he
was
the
kind
to
deal
any
of
it
out
to
his
family
so
count
would
have
to
go
clerking
in
a
dry
goods
store
if
he
promised
to
support
himself
but
he
did
propose
to
do
it
he
thought
he
got
on
to
a
soft
thing
of
course
we
an
lot
and
we
should
have
stood
him
if
he
been
a
nice
fellow
but
he
was
lily
mother
used
to
find
her
crying
in
her
bedroom
and
it
came
out
by
degrees
that
it
was
because
adolf
had
been
quarrelling
with
her
and
saying
sneering
things
about
her
family
when
her
mother
talked
to
him
he
was
insulting
then
bills
began
to
come
in
and
lily
was
expected
to
get
me
to
pay
them
and
they
were
not
the
kind
of
bills
a
decent
fellow
calls
on
another
man
to
pay
but
i
did
it
five
or
six
times
to
make
it
easy
for
her
i
tell
her
that
they
gave
an
older
chap
than
himself
sidelights
on
the
situation
but
that
did
work
well
he
thought
i
did
it
because
i
had
to
and
he
began
to
feel
free
and
easy
about
it
and
did
try
to
cover
up
his
tracks
so
much
when
he
sent
in
a
new
lot
he
was
always
working
lily
he
began
to
consider
himself
master
of
the
house
he
intimated
that
a
private
carriage
ought
to
be
kept
for
them
he
said
it
was
beggarly
that
he
should
have
to
consider
the
rest
of
the
family
when
he
wanted
to
go
out
when
i
got
on
to
the
situation
i
began
to
enjoy
it
i
let
him
spread
himself
for
a
while
just
to
see
what
he
would
do
good
lord
i
could
have
believed
that
any
fellow
could
have
thought
any
other
fellow
could
be
such
a
fool
as
he
thought
i
was
he
went
perfectly
crazy
after
a
month
or
so
and
ordered
me
about
and
patronised
me
as
if
i
was
a
bootblack
he
meant
to
teach
something
to
so
at
last
i
had
a
talk
with
lily
and
told
her
i
was
going
to
put
an
end
to
it
of
course
she
cried
and
was
half
frightened
to
death
but
by
that
time
he
had
her
so
that
she
only
wanted
to
get
rid
of
him
so
i
sent
for
him
and
had
a
talk
with
him
in
my
office
i
led
him
on
to
saying
all
he
had
on
his
mind
he
explained
to
me
what
a
condescension
it
was
for
a
man
like
himself
to
marry
a
girl
like
lily
he
made
a
dignified
touching
picture
of
all
the
disadvantages
of
such
an
alliance
and
all
the
advantages
they
ought
to
bring
in
exchange
to
the
man
who
bore
up
under
them
i
rubbed
my
head
and
looked
worried
every
now
and
then
and
cleared
my
throat
apologetically
just
to
warm
him
up
i
can
tell
you
that
fellow
felt
happy
downright
happy
when
he
saw
how
humbly
i
listened
to
him
he
positively
swelled
up
with
hope
and
comfort
he
thought
i
was
going
to
turn
out
well
real
well
i
was
going
to
pay
up
just
as
a
vulgar
new
york
ought
to
do
and
thank
god
for
the
blessed
privilege
why
he
was
real
eloquent
about
his
blood
and
his
ancestors
and
the
slosh
so
when
he
finished
i
cleared
my
throat
in
a
nervous
ingratiating
kind
of
way
again
and
i
asked
him
kind
of
anxiously
what
he
thought
would
be
the
proper
thing
for
a
new
york
millionaire
to
do
under
the
circumstances
what
he
would
approve
of
sir
nigel
was
disgusted
to
see
the
narrator
twist
his
mouth
into
a
sweet
shrewd
repressed
grin
even
as
he
expectorated
into
the
nearest
receptacle
the
grin
was
greeted
by
a
shout
of
laughter
from
his
companions
what
did
he
say
stebbins
someone
cried
he
said
explained
stebbins
deliberately
he
said
that
an
allowance
was
the
proper
thing
he
said
that
a
man
of
his
rank
must
have
resources
and
that
it
was
dignified
for
him
to
have
to
ask
his
wife
or
his
wife
father
for
money
when
he
wanted
it
he
said
an
allowance
was
what
he
felt
he
had
a
right
to
expect
and
then
he
twisted
his
moustache
and
said
proposition
did
i
make
what
would
i
allow
him
the
storyteller
hearers
evidently
knew
him
well
their
laughter
was
louder
than
before
let
hear
the
rest
joe
let
hear
it
well
replied
stebbins
almost
thoughtfully
i
just
got
up
and
said
it
wo
take
long
for
me
to
answer
that
i
always
been
fond
of
my
children
and
lily
is
rather
my
pet
she
always
had
everything
she
wanted
and
she
always
shall
she
a
good
girl
and
she
deserves
it
i
allow
you
the
significant
deliberation
of
his
drawl
could
scarcely
be
described
i
allow
you
just
five
minutes
to
get
out
of
this
room
before
i
kick
you
out
and
if
i
kick
you
out
of
the
room
i
kick
you
down
the
stairs
and
if
i
kick
you
down
the
stairs
i
shall
have
got
my
blood
comfortably
warmed
up
and
i
kick
you
down
the
street
and
round
the
block
and
down
to
hoboken
because
you
going
to
take
the
steamer
there
and
go
back
to
the
place
you
came
from
to
the
slosh
thing
or
whatever
you
call
it
we
have
a
damned
bit
of
use
for
you
here
and
believe
it
or
not
gentlemen
looking
round
with
the
smile
he
took
that
passage
and
back
he
went
and
lily
living
with
her
mother
and
i
mean
to
hold
on
to
sir
nigel
got
up
and
left
the
club
when
the
story
was
finished
he
took
a
long
walk
down
broadway
gnawing
his
lip
and
holding
his
head
in
the
air
he
used
blasphemous
language
at
intervals
in
a
low
voice
some
of
it
was
addressed
to
his
fate
and
some
of
it
to
the
vulgar
mercantile
coarseness
and
obtuseness
of
other
people
they
do
know
what
they
are
talking
of
he
said
it
is
unheard
of
what
do
they
expect
i
never
thought
of
this
damn
it
i
like
a
rat
in
a
it
was
plain
enough
that
he
could
not
arrange
his
fortune
as
he
had
anticipated
when
he
decided
to
begin
to
make
love
to
little
pink
and
white
rosy
vanderpoel
if
he
began
to
demand
monetary
advantages
in
his
dealing
with
his
future
wife
people
in
their
settlement
of
her
fortune
he
might
arouse
suspicion
and
inquiry
he
did
not
want
inquiry
either
in
connection
with
his
own
means
or
his
past
manner
of
living
people
who
hated
him
would
be
sure
to
crop
up
with
stories
of
things
better
left
alone
there
were
always
meddling
fools
ready
to
interfere
his
walk
was
long
and
full
of
savage
thinking
once
or
twice
as
he
realised
what
the
disinterestedness
of
his
sentiments
was
supposed
to
be
a
short
laugh
broke
from
him
which
was
rather
like
the
snort
of
the
bishopess
i
am
supposed
to
be
moonstruck
over
a
simpering
american
chit
moonstruck
damn
but
when
he
returned
to
his
hotel
he
had
made
up
his
mind
and
was
beginning
to
look
over
the
situation
in
evil
cold
blood
matters
must
be
settled
without
delay
and
he
was
shrewd
enough
to
realise
that
with
his
temper
and
its
varied
resources
a
timid
girl
would
not
be
difficult
to
manage
he
had
seen
at
an
early
stage
of
their
acquaintance
that
rosy
was
greatly
impressed
by
the
superiority
of
his
bearing
that
he
could
make
her
blush
with
embarrassment
when
he
conveyed
to
her
that
she
had
made
a
mistake
that
he
could
chill
her
miserably
when
he
chose
to
assume
a
lofty
stiffness
a
man
domestic
armoury
was
filled
with
weapons
if
he
could
make
a
woman
feel
gauche
inexperienced
in
the
wrong
when
he
was
safely
married
he
could
pave
the
way
to
what
he
felt
was
the
only
practical
and
feasible
end
if
he
had
been
marrying
a
woman
with
more
brains
she
would
be
more
difficult
to
subdue
but
with
rosalie
vanderpoel
processes
were
not
necessary
if
you
shocked
bewildered
or
frightened
her
with
accusations
sulks
or
sneers
her
light
innocent
head
was
set
in
such
a
whirl
that
the
rest
was
easy
it
was
possible
upon
the
whole
that
the
thing
might
not
turn
out
so
infernally
ill
after
all

took

was

by

elate

of

miss

frocks
were

a
thousand
trunks
more
or
less
across
the
atlantic
when
the
ship
steamed
away
from
the
dock
the
wharf
was
like
a
flower
garden
in
the
blaze
of
brilliant
and
delicate
attire
worn
by
the
bevy
of
relatives
and
intimates
who
stood
waving
their
handkerchiefs
and
laughingly
calling
out
farewell
good
wishes
sir
nigel
mental
attitude
was
not
a
sympathetic
or
admiring
one
as
he
stood
by
his
bride
side
looking
back
if
rosy
half
happy
half
tearful
excitement
had
left
her
the
leisure
to
reflect
on
his
expression
she
would
not
have
felt
it
encouraging
what
a
deuce
of
a
row
americans
make
he
said
even
before
they
were
out
of
hearing
of
the
voices
it
will
be
a
positive
rest
to
be
in
a
country
where
the
women
do
not
cackle
and
shriek
with
he
said
it
with
that
simple
rudeness
which
at
times
professed
to
be
almost
impersonal
and
which
rosalie
had
usually
tried
to
believe
was
the
outcome
of
a
kind
of
cool
british
humour
but
this
time
she
started
a
little
at
his
words
i
suppose
we
do
make
more
noise
than
english
people
she
admitted
a
second
or
so
later
i
wonder
why
and
without
waiting
for
an
answer
somewhat
as
if
she
had
not
expected
or
quite
wanted
one
she
leaned
a
little
farther
over
the
side
to
look
back
waving
her
small
fluttering
handkerchief
to
the
many
still
in
tumult
on
the
wharf
she
was
not
perceptive
or
quick
enough
to
take
offence
to
realise
that
the
remark
was
significant
and
that
sir
nigel
had
already
begun
as
he
meant
to
go
on
it
was
far
from
being
his
intention
to
play
the
part
of
an
american
husband
who
was
plainly
a
creature
in
whom
no
authority
vested
itself
americans
let
their
women
say
and
do
anything
and
were
capable
of
fetching
and
carrying
for
them
he
had
seen
a
man
run
upstairs
for
his
wife
wrap
cheerfully
without
the
least
apparent
sense
that
the
service
was
the
part
of
a
footman
if
there
was
one
in
the
house
a
parlour
maid
if
there
was
not
sir
nigel
had
been
brought
up
in
the
good
early
victorian
days
when
a
nice
little
woman
to
fetch
your
slippers
for
you
figured
in
certain
circles
as
domestic
bliss
girls
were
educated
to
fetch
slippers
as
retrievers
were
trained
to
go
into
the
water
after
sticks
and
terriers
to
bring
back
balls
thrown
for
them
the
new
lady
anstruthers
had
it
supervened
several
opportunities
to
obtain
a
new
view
of
her
bridegroom
character
before
their
voyage
across
the
atlantic
was
over
at
this
period
of
the
slower
and
more
cumbrous
weaving
of
the
shuttle
the
world
had
not
yet
awakened
even
to
the
possibilities
of
the
ocean
greyhound
an
atlantic
voyage
at
times
was
capable
of
offering
to
a
bride
and
bridegroom
days
enough
to
begin
to
glance
into
their
future
with
a
premonition
of
the
waning
of
the
honeymoon
at
least
and
especially
if
they
were
not
to
wish
wearily
that
the
first
half
of
it
were
over
rosalie
was
not
weary
but
she
began
to
be
bewildered
as
she
had
never
been
a
clever
girl
or
quick
to
perceive
and
had
spent
her
life
among
american
men
she
was
not
prepared
with
any
precedent
which
made
her
situation
clear
the
first
time
sir
nigel
showed
his
temper
to
her
she
simply
stared
at
him
her
eyes
looking
like
those
of
a
puzzled
questioning
child
then
she
broke
into
her
nervous
little
laugh
because
she
did
not
know
what
else
to
do
at
his
second
outbreak
her
stare
was
rather
startled
and
she
did
not
laugh
her
first
awakening
was
to
an
anxious
wonderment
concerning
certain
moods
of
gloom
or
what
seemed
to
be
gloom
to
which
he
seemed
prone
as
she
lay
in
her
steamer
chair
he
would
at
times
march
stiffly
up
and
down
the
deck
apparently
aware
of
no
other
existence
than
his
own
his
features
expressing
a
certain
clouded
resentment
of
whose
very
unexplainableness
she
secretly
stood
in
awe
she
was
not
astute
enough
poor
girl
to
leave
him
alone
and
when
with
innocent
questionings
she
endeavoured
to
discover
his
trouble
the
greatest
mystification
she
encountered
was
that
he
had
the
power
to
make
her
feel
that
she
was
in
some
way
taking
a
liberty
and
showing
her
lack
of
tact
and
perspicuity
is
anything
the
matter
nigel
she
asked
at
first
wondering
if
she
were
guilty
of
silliness
in
trying
to
slip
her
hand
into
his
she
was
sure
she
had
been
when
he
answered
her
no
he
said
chillingly
i
do
believe
you
are
happy
she
returned
somehow
you
seem
so
so
i
have
reasons
for
being
depressed
he
replied
and
it
was
with
a
stiff
finality
which
struck
a
note
of
warning
to
her
signifying
that
it
would
be
better
taste
in
her
to
put
an
end
to
her
simple
efforts
she
vaguely
felt
herself
put
in
the
wrong
and
he
preferred
that
it
should
be
so
it
was
the
best
form
of
preparation
for
any
mood
he
might
see
that
it
might
pay
him
to
show
her
in
the
future
he
was
in
fact
confronting
disdainfully
his
position
he
had
her
on
his
hands
and
he
was
returning
to
his
relations
with
no
definite
advantage
to
exhibit
as
the
result
of
having
married
her
she
had
been
supplied
with
an
income
but
he
had
no
control
over
it
it
would
not
have
been
so
if
he
had
not
been
in
such
straits
that
he
had
been
afraid
to
risk
his
chance
by
making
a
stand
to
have
a
wife
with
money
a
silly
sweet
temper
and
no
will
of
her
own
was
of
course
better
than
to
be
penniless
head
over
heels
in
debt
and
hemmed
in
by
difficulties
on
every
side
he
had
seen
women
trained
to
give
in
to
anything
rather
than
be
bullied
in
public
to
accede
in
the
end
to
any
demand
rather
than
endure
the
shame
of
a
certain
kind
of
scene
made
before
servants
and
a
certain
kind
of
insolence
used
to
relatives
and
guests
the
quality
he
found
most
maddeningly
irritating
in
rosalie
was
her
obviously
absolute
unconsciousness
of
the
fact
that
it
was
entirely
natural
and
proper
that
her
resources
should
be
in
her
husband
hands
he
had
indeed
even
in
these
early
days
made
a
tentative
effort
or
so
in
the
form
of
a
suggestive
speech
he
had
given
her
openings
to
give
him
an
opening
to
put
things
on
a
practical
basis
but
she
had
never
had
the
intelligence
to
see
what
he
was
aiming
at
and
he
had
found
himself
almost
floundering
ungracefully
in
his
remarks
while
she
had
looked
at
him
without
a
sign
of
comprehension
in
her
simple
anxious
blue
eyes
the
creature
was
actually
trying
to
understand
him
and
could
not
that
was
the
worst
of
it
the
blank
wall
of
her
unconsciousness
her
childlike
belief
that
he
was
far
too
grand
a
personage
to
require
anything
these
were
the
things
he
was
thinking
over
when
he
walked
up
and
down
the
deck
in
unamiable
solitariness
rosy
awakened
to
the
amazed
consciousness
of
the
fact
that
instead
of
being
pleased
with
the
luxury
and
prettiness
of
her
wardrobe
and
appointments
he
seemed
to
dislike
and
disdain
them
you
american
women
change
your
clothes
too
much
and
think
too
much
of
them
was
one
of
his
first
amiable
criticisms
you
spend
more
than
women
should
spend
on
mere
dresses
and
bonnets
in
new
york
it
always
strikes
an
englishman
that
the
women
look
endimanche
at
whatever
time
of
day
you
come
across
oh
nigel
cried
rosy
woefully
she
could
not
think
of
anything
more
to
say
than
oh
nigel
i
am
sorry
to
say
it
is
true
he
replied
loftily
that
she
was
an
american
and
a
new
yorker
was
being
impressed
upon
poor
little
lady
anstruthers
in
a
new
way
somehow
as
if
the
mere
cold
statement
of
the
fact
put
a
fine
edge
of
sarcasm
to
any
remark
she
was
of
too
innocent
a
loyalty
to
wish
that
she
was
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
but
she
did
wish
that
nigel
was
not
so
prejudiced
against
the
places
and
people
she
cared
for
so
much
she
was
sitting
in
her
stateroom
enfolded
in
a
dressing
gown
covered
with
cascades
of
lace
tied
with
knots
of
embroidered
ribbon
and
her
maid
hannah
who
admired
her
greatly
was
brushing
her
fair
long
hair
with
a
brush
ornamented
with
a
monogram
of
jewels
if
she
had
been
a
french
duchess
of
a
piquant
type
or
an
english
one
with
an
aquiline
nose
she
would
have
been
beyond
criticism
if
she
had
been
a
plump
woman
or
an
ugly
gross
one
she
would
have
looked
vulgar
but
she
was
a
little
thin
fair
new
yorker
and
though
she
was
not
beyond
criticism
if
one
demanded
high
distinction
she
was
pretty
and
nice
to
look
at
but
nigel
anstruthers
would
not
allow
this
to
her
his
own
tailors
bills
being
far
in
arrears
and
his
pocket
disgustingly
empty
the
sight
of
her
ingenuous
sumptuousness
and
the
gay
accustomed
simpleness
of
outlook
with
which
she
accepted
it
as
her
natural
right
irritated
him
and
roused
his
venom
bills
would
remain
unpaid
if
she
was
permitted
to
spend
her
money
on
this
sort
of
thing
without
any
consideration
for
the
requirements
of
other
people
he
inhaled
the
air
and
made
a
gesture
of
distaste
this
sachet
business
is
rather
overpowering
he
said
it
is
the
sort
of
thing
a
woman
should
be
particularly
discreet
oh
nigel
cried
the
poor
girl
agitatedly
hannah
do
go
and
call
the
steward
to
open
the
windows
is
it
really
strong
she
implored
as
hannah
went
out
how
dreadful
it
only
orris
and
i
did
know
hannah
had
put
it
in
the
my
dear
rosalie
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
taking
in
both
herself
and
her
dressing
case
it
is
all
too
all
wh
what
gaspingly
the
whole
thing
all
that
lace
and
love
knot
arrangement
the
brushes
and
scent
bottles
with
diamonds
and
rubies
sticking
in
they
they
were
wedding
presents
they
came
from
tiffany
everyone
thought
them
they
look
as
if
they
belonged
to
the
dressing
table
of
a
french
woman
of
the
i
feel
as
if
i
had
actually
walked
into
the
apartment
of
some
notorious
parisian
rosalie
vanderpoel
was
a
little
person
her
people
were
of
the
type
therefore
she
did
not
understand
all
that
this
ironic
speech
implied
but
she
gathered
enough
of
its
significance
to
cause
her
to
turn
first
red
and
then
pale
and
then
to
burst
into
tears
she
was
crying
and
trying
to
conceal
the
fact
when
hannah
returned
she
bent
her
head
and
touched
her
eyes
furtively
while
her
toilette
was
completed
sir
nigel
had
retired
from
the
scene
but
he
had
done
so
feeling
that
he
had
planted
a
seed
and
bestowed
a
practical
lesson
he
had
it
is
true
bestowed
one
but
again
she
had
not
understood
its
significance
and
was
only
left
bewildered
and
unhappy
she
began
to
be
nervous
and
uncertain
about
herself
and
about
his
moods
and
points
of
view
she
had
never
been
made
to
feel
so
at
home
everyone
had
been
kind
to
her
and
lenient
to
her
lack
of
brilliancy
no
one
had
expected
her
to
be
brilliant
and
she
had
been
quite
resigned
to
the
fact
that
she
was
not
the
kind
of
girl
who
shone
either
in
society
or
elsewhere
she
did
not
resent
the
fact
that
she
knew
people
said
of
her
she
is
in
the
least
bit
bright
rosy
vanderpoel
but
she
a
nice
sweet
little
she
had
tried
to
be
nice
and
sweet
and
had
aspired
to
nothing
higher
but
now
that
seemed
so
much
less
than
enough
perhaps
nigel
ought
to
have
married
one
of
the
clever
ones
someone
who
would
have
known
how
to
understand
him
and
who
would
have
been
more
entertaining
than
she
could
be
perhaps
she
was
beginning
to
bore
him
perhaps
he
was
finding
her
out
and
beginning
to
get
tired
at
this
point
the
always
too
ready
tears
would
rise
to
her
eyes
and
she
would
be
overwhelmed
by
a
sense
of
homesickness
often
she
cried
herself
silently
to
sleep
longing
for
her
mother
her
nice
comfortable
ordinary
mother
whom
she
had
several
times
felt
nigel
had
some
difficulty
in
being
unreservedly
polite
to
though
he
had
been
polite
on
the
surface
by
the
time
they
landed
she
had
been
living
under
so
much
strain
in
her
effort
to
seem
quite
unchanged
that
she
had
lost
her
nerve
she
did
not
feel
well
and
was
sometimes
afraid
that
she
might
do
something
silly
and
hysterical
in
spite
of
herself
begin
to
cry
for
instance
when
there
was
really
no
explanation
for
her
doing
it
but
when
she
reached
london
the
novelty
of
everything
so
excited
her
that
she
thought
she
was
going
to
be
better
and
then
she
said
to
herself
it
would
be
proved
to
her
that
all
her
fears
had
been
nonsense
this
return
of
hope
made
her
quite
and
she
was
almost
gay
in
her
little
outbursts
of
delight
and
admiration
as
she
drove
about
the
streets
with
her
husband
she
did
not
know
that
her
ingenuous
ignorance
of
things
he
had
known
all
his
life
her
rapture
over
common
monuments
of
history
led
him
to
say
to
himself
that
he
felt
rather
as
if
he
were
taking
a
housemaid
to
see
a
lord
mayor
show
before
going
to
stornham
court
they
spent
a
few
days
in
town
there
had
been
no
intention
of
proclaiming
their
presence
to
the
world
and
they
did
not
do
so
but
unluckily
certain
tradesmen
discovered
the
fact
that
sir
nigel
anstruthers
had
returned
to
england
with
the
bride
he
had
secured
in
new
york
the
conclusion
to
be
deduced
from
this
circumstance
was
that
the
particular
moment
was
a
good
one
at
which
to
send
in
bills
for
acct
the
tradesmen
quite
shared
anstruthers
point
of
view
their
reasoning
was
delightfully
simple
and
they
were
wholly
unaware
that
it
might
have
been
called
gross
a
man
over
his
head
and
ears
in
debt
naturally
expected
his
creditors
would
be
paid
by
the
young
woman
who
had
married
him
america
had
in
these
days
been
so
little
explored
by
the
thrifty
impecunious
that
its
ingenuous
sentimentality
in
certain
matters
was
by
no
means
comprehended
by
each
post
sir
nigel
received
numerous
bills
sometimes
letters
accompanied
them
and
once
or
twice
respectful
but
firm
male
persons
brought
them
by
hand
and
demanded
interviews
which
irritated
sir
nigel
extremely
given
time
to
arrange
matters
with
rosalie
to
train
her
to
some
sense
of
her
duty
he
believed
that
the
acct
rendered
could
be
wiped
off
but
he
saw
he
must
have
time
she
was
such
a
little
fool
again
and
again
he
was
furious
at
the
fate
which
had
forced
him
to
take
her
the
truth
was
that
rosalie
knew
nothing
whatever
about
unpaid
bills
reuben
vanderpoel
daughters
had
never
encountered
an
indignant
tradesman
in
their
lives
when
they
went
into
stores
they
were
received
with
unfeigned
rapture
everything
was
dragged
forth
to
be
displayed
to
them
attendants
waited
to
leap
forth
to
supply
their
smallest
behest
they
knew
no
other
phase
of
existence
than
the
one
in
which
one
could
buy
anything
one
wanted
and
pay
any
price
demanded
for
it
consequently
rosalie
did
not
recognise
signs
which
would
have
been
obviously
recognisable
by
the
initiated
if
sir
nigel
anstruthers
had
been
a
nice
young
fellow
who
had
loved
her
and
he
had
been
honest
enough
to
make
a
clean
breast
of
his
difficulties
she
would
have
thrown
herself
into
his
arms
and
implored
him
effusively
to
make
use
of
all
her
available
funds
and
if
the
supply
had
been
insufficient
would
have
immediately
written
to
her
father
for
further
donations
knowing
that
her
appeal
would
be
responded
to
at
once
but
sir
nigel
anstruthers
cherished
no
sentiment
for
any
other
individual
than
himself
and
he
had
no
intention
of
explaining
that
his
mere
vanity
had
caused
him
to
mislead
her
that
his
rank
and
estate
counted
for
nothing
and
that
he
was
in
fact
a
pauper
loaded
with
dishonest
debts
he
wanted
money
but
he
wanted
it
to
be
given
to
him
as
if
he
conferred
a
favour
by
receiving
it
it
must
be
transferred
to
him
as
though
it
were
his
by
right
what
did
a
man
marry
for
therefore
his
wife
unconsciousness
that
she
was
inflicting
outrage
upon
him
by
her
mere
mental
attitude
filled
his
being
with
slowly
rising
gall
poor
rosalie
went
joyfully
forth
shopping
after
the
manner
of
all
newly
arrived
americans
she
bought
new
toilettes
and
gewgaws
and
presents
for
her
friends
and
relations
in
new
york
and
each
package
which
was
delivered
at
the
hotel
added
to
sir
nigel
rage
that
the
little
blockhead
should
be
allowed
to
do
what
she
liked
with
her
money
and
that
he
should
not
be
able
to
forbid
her
this
he
said
to
himself
at
intervals
of
five
minutes
through
the
day
which
led
to
another
small
episode
you
are
spending
a
great
deal
of
money
he
said
one
morning
in
his
condemnatory
manner
rosalie
looked
up
from
the
lace
flounce
which
had
just
been
delivered
and
gave
the
little
nervous
laugh
which
was
becoming
entirely
uncertain
of
propitiating
am
i
she
answered
they
say
all
americans
spend
a
good
your
money
ought
to
be
in
proper
hands
and
properly
managed
he
went
on
with
cold
precision
if
you
were
an
english
woman
your
husband
would
control
would
he
the
simple
obtuseness
of
her
tone
was
an
infuriating
thing
to
him
there
was
the
usual
shade
of
troubled
surprise
in
her
eyes
as
they
met
his
i
do
think
men
in
america
ever
do
that
i
do
believe
the
nice
ones
want
to
you
see
they
have
such
a
pride
about
always
giving
things
to
women
and
taking
care
of
them
i
believe
a
nice
american
man
would
break
stones
in
the
street
rather
than
take
money
from
a
woman
even
his
wife
i
mean
while
he
could
work
of
course
if
he
was
ill
or
had
ill
luck
or
anything
like
that
he
would
be
so
proud
as
not
to
take
it
from
the
person
who
loved
him
most
and
wanted
to
help
him
you
do
sometimes
hear
of
a
man
who
wo
work
and
lets
his
wife
support
him
but
it
very
seldom
and
they
are
always
the
low
kind
that
other
men
look
down
wanted
to
help
sir
nigel
selected
the
phrase
and
quoted
it
between
puffs
of
the
cigar
he
held
in
his
fine
rather
hands
and
his
voice
expressed
a
not
too
subtle
sneer
a
woman
is
not
her
husband
when
she
gives
him
control
of
her
fortune
she
is
only
doing
her
duty
and
accepting
her
proper
position
with
regard
to
him
the
law
used
to
settle
the
thing
it
rosy
faltered
weakly
she
knew
he
was
offended
again
and
that
she
was
once
more
somehow
in
the
wrong
so
many
things
about
her
seemed
to
displease
him
and
when
he
was
displeased
he
always
reminded
her
that
she
was
stupidly
objectionably
guilty
of
not
being
an
english
woman
whatsoever
it
happened
to
be
the
fault
she
had
committed
out
of
her
depth
of
ignorance
he
did
not
forget
it
it
was
no
habit
of
his
to
endeavour
to
dismiss
offences
he
preferred
to
hold
them
in
possession
as
if
they
were
treasures
and
to
turn
them
over
and
over
in
the
mental
seclusion
which
nourishes
the
growth
of
injuries
since
within
its
barriers
there
is
no
chance
of
their
being
palliated
by
the
apologies
or
explanations
of
the
offender
during
their
journey
to
stornham
court
the
next
day
he
was
in
one
of
his
black
moods
once
in
the
railway
carriage
he
paid
small
attention
to
his
wife
but
sat
rigidly
reading
his
times
until
about
midway
to
their
destination
he
descended
at
a
station
and
paid
a
visit
to
the
buffet
in
the
small
refreshment
room
after
which
he
settled
himself
to
doze
in
an
exceedingly
unbecoming
attitude
his
travelling
cap
pulled
down
his
rather
heavy
face
congested
with
the
dark
flush
rosalie
had
not
yet
learned
was
due
to
the
fact
that
he
had
hastily
tossed
off
two
or
three
whiskies
and
sodas
though
he
was
never
either
thick
of
utterance
or
unsteady
on
his
feet
whisky
and
soda
formed
an
important
factor
in
his
existence
when
he
was
annoyed
or
dull
he
at
once
took
the
necessary
precautions
against
being
overcome
by
these
feelings
and
the
effect
upon
a
constitutionally
evil
temper
was
to
transform
it
into
an
infernal
one
the
night
had
been
a
bad
one
for
rosy
such
floods
of
homesick
longing
had
overpowered
her
that
she
had
not
been
able
to
sleep
she
had
risen
feeling
shaky
and
hysterical
and
her
nervousness
had
been
added
to
by
her
fear
that
nigel
might
observe
her
and
make
comment
of
course
she
told
herself
it
was
natural
that
he
should
not
wish
her
to
appear
at
stornham
court
looking
a
pale
little
fright
her
efforts
to
be
cheerful
had
indeed
been
somewhat
touching
but
they
had
met
with
small
encouragement
she
thought
the
country
lovely
as
the
train
sped
through
it
and
a
lump
rose
in
her
small
throat
because
she
knew
she
might
have
been
so
happy
if
she
had
not
been
so
frightened
and
miserable
the
thing
which
had
been
dawning
upon
her
took
clearer
more
awful
form
incidents
she
had
tried
to
explain
and
excuse
to
herself
upon
all
sorts
of
futile
simple
grounds
began
to
loom
up
before
her
in
something
like
their
actual
proportions
she
had
heard
of
men
who
had
changed
their
manner
towards
girls
after
they
had
married
them
but
she
did
not
know
they
had
begun
to
change
so
soon
this
was
so
early
in
the
honeymoon
to
be
sitting
in
a
railway
carriage
in
a
corner
remote
from
that
occupied
by
a
bridegroom
who
read
his
paper
in
what
was
obviously
intentional
resentful
solitude
emily
soame
father
she
remembered
it
against
her
will
had
been
obliged
to
get
a
divorce
for
emily
after
her
two
years
of
wretched
married
life
but
alfred
soames
had
been
quite
nice
for
six
months
at
least
it
seemed
as
if
all
this
must
be
a
dream
one
of
those
nightmare
things
in
which
you
suddenly
find
yourself
married
to
someone
you
can
not
bear
and
you
do
know
how
it
happened
because
you
yourself
have
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
matter
she
felt
that
presently
she
must
waken
with
a
start
and
find
herself
breathing
fast
and
panting
out
half
laughing
half
crying
oh
i
am
so
glad
it
not
true
i
am
so
glad
it
not
true
but
this
was
true
and
there
was
nigel
and
she
was
in
a
new
unexplored
world
her
little
trembling
hands
clutched
each
other
the
happy
light
girlish
days
full
of
ease
and
friendliness
and
decency
seemed
gone
forever
it
was
not
rosalie
vanderpoel
who
pressed
her
colourless
face
against
the
glass
of
the
window
looking
out
at
the
flying
trees
it
was
the
wife
of
nigel
anstruthers
and
suddenly
by
some
hideous
magic
she
had
been
snatched
from
the
world
to
which
she
belonged
and
was
being
dragged
by
a
gaoler
to
a
prison
from
which
she
did
not
know
how
to
escape
already
nigel
had
managed
to
convey
to
her
that
in
england
a
woman
who
was
married
could
do
nothing
to
defend
herself
against
her
husband
and
that
to
endeavour
to
do
anything
was
the
last
impossible
touch
of
vulgar
ignominy
the
vivid
realisation
of
the
situation
seized
upon
her
like
a
possession
as
she
glanced
sideways
at
her
bridegroom
and
hurriedly
glanced
away
again
with
a
little
hysterical
shudder
new
york
lenient
free
new
york
was
millions
of
miles
away
and
nigel
was
so
loathly
near
and
and
so
ugly
she
had
never
known
before
that
he
was
so
ugly
that
his
face
was
so
heavy
his
skin
so
thick
and
coarse
and
his
expression
so
evilly
she
was
not
sufficiently
analytical
to
be
conscious
that
she
had
with
one
bound
leaped
to
the
appalling
point
of
feeling
uncontrollable
physical
abhorrence
of
the
creature
to
whom
she
was
chained
for
life
she
was
terrified
at
finding
herself
forced
to
combat
the
realisation
that
there
were
certain
expressions
of
his
countenance
which
made
her
feel
sick
with
repulsion
her
also
was
as
great
as
her
terror
he
was
her
husband
her
husband
and
she
was
a
wicked
girl
she
repeated
the
words
to
herself
again
and
again
but
remotely
she
knew
that
when
she
said
he
is
my
husband
that
was
the
worst
thing
of
all
this
inward
struggle
was
a
bad
preparation
for
any
added
misery
and
when
their
railroad
journey
terminated
at
stornham
station
she
was
met
by
new
bewilderment
the
station
itself
was
a
rustic
place
where
wild
roses
climbed
down
a
bank
to
meet
the
very
train
itself
the
station
master
cottage
had
roses
and
clusters
of
lilies
waving
in
its
tiny
garden
the
station
master
a
man
came
forward
baring
his
head
to
open
the
railroad
carriage
door
with
his
own
hand
rosy
thought
him
delightful
and
bowed
and
smiled
to
him
and
to
his
wife
and
little
girls
who
were
curtseying
at
the
garden
gate
she
was
sufficiently
homesick
to
be
actually
grateful
to
them
for
their
air
of
welcoming
her
but
as
she
smiled
she
glanced
furtively
at
nigel
to
see
if
she
was
doing
exactly
the
right
thing
he
himself
was
not
smiling
and
did
not
unbend
even
when
the
station
master
who
had
known
him
from
his
boyhood
felt
at
liberty
to
offer
a
deferential
welcome
happy
to
see
you
home
with
her
ladyship
sir
nigel
he
said
very
happy
if
i
may
say
sir
nigel
responded
to
the
respectful
amiability
with
a
lifting
of
his
right
hand
accompanied
by
a
grunt
d
do
wells
he
said
and
strode
past
him
to
speak
to
the
footman
who
had
come
from
stornham
court
with
the
carriage
the
new
and
nervous
little
lady
anstruthers
who
was
left
to
trot
after
her
husband
smiled
again
at
the
ruddy
fellow
this
time
in
conscious
deprecation
in
the
simplicity
of
her
republican
sympathy
with
a
fellow
creature
who
might
feel
himself
snubbed
she
could
have
shaken
him
by
the
hand
she
had
even
parted
her
lips
to
venture
a
word
of
civility
when
she
was
startled
by
hearing
sir
voice
raised
in
angry
rating
damned
bad
management
not
to
bring
something
else
she
heard
kind
of
thing
you
fellows
are
always
she
made
her
way
to
the
carriage
flurried
again
by
not
knowing
whether
she
was
doing
right
or
wrong
sir
nigel
had
given
her
no
instructions
and
she
had
not
yet
learned
that
when
he
was
in
a
certain
humour
there
was
equal
fault
in
obeying
or
disobeying
such
orders
as
he
gave
the
carriage
from
the
court
not
in
the
least
a
new
or
smart
equipage
was
drawn
up
before
the
entrance
of
the
station
and
sir
nigel
was
in
a
rage
because
the
vehicle
brought
for
the
luggage
was
too
small
to
carry
it
all
very
sorry
sir
nigel
said
the
coachman
touching
his
hat
two
or
three
times
in
his
agitation
very
sorry
the
omnibus
was
a
little
out
of
order
the
springs
sir
nigel
and
i
thought
you
thought
was
the
heated
interruption
what
right
had
you
to
think
damn
it
you
are
not
paid
to
think
you
are
paid
to
do
your
work
properly
here
are
a
lot
of
damned
boxes
which
ought
to
go
with
us
and
where
your
maid
wheeling
round
upon
his
wife
rosalie
turned
towards
the
woman
who
was
approaching
from
the
waiting
room
hannah
she
said
timorously
drop
those
confounded
bundles
ordered
sir
nigel
and
show
james
the
boxes
her
ladyship
is
obliged
to
have
this
evening
be
quick
about
it
and
do
pick
out
half
a
dozen
the
cart
ca
take
hannah
looked
frightened
this
sort
of
thing
was
new
to
her
too
she
shuffled
her
packages
on
to
a
seat
and
followed
the
footman
to
the
luggage
sir
nigel
continued
rating
the
coachman
any
form
of
violent
was
welcome
to
him
at
any
time
and
when
he
was
irritated
he
found
it
a
distinct
luxury
to
kick
a
dog
or
throw
a
boot
at
a
cat
the
springs
of
the
omnibus
he
argued
had
no
right
to
be
broken
when
it
was
known
that
he
was
coming
home
his
anger
was
only
added
to
by
the
coachman
halting
endeavours
in
his
excuses
to
veil
a
fact
he
knew
his
master
was
aware
of
that
everything
at
stornham
was
more
or
less
out
of
order
and
that
dilapidations
were
the
inevitable
result
of
there
being
no
money
to
pay
for
repairs
the
man
leaned
forward
on
his
box
and
spoke
at
last
in
a
low
tone
the
bus
has
been
broken
some
time
he
said
it
it
an
expensive
job
sir
nigel
her
ladyship
thought
it
better
to
sir
nigel
turned
white
about
the
mouth
hold
your
tongue
he
commanded
and
the
coachman
got
red
in
the
face
saluted
biting
his
lips
and
sat
very
stiff
and
upright
on
his
box
the
station
master
edged
away
uneasily
and
tried
to
look
as
if
he
were
not
listening
but
rosalie
could
see
that
he
could
not
help
hearing
nor
could
the
country
people
who
had
been
passengers
by
the
train
and
who
were
collecting
their
belongings
and
getting
into
their
traps
lady
anstruthers
was
ignored
and
remained
standing
while
the
scene
went
on
she
could
not
help
recalling
the
manner
in
which
she
had
been
invariably
received
in
new
york
on
her
return
from
any
journey
how
she
was
met
by
comfortable
merry
people
and
taken
care
of
at
once
this
was
so
strange
it
was
so
queer
so
different
oh
never
mind
nigel
dear
she
said
at
last
with
innocent
indiscretion
it
does
really
matter
you
sir
nigel
turned
upon
her
a
blaze
of
haughty
indignation
if
you
pardon
my
saying
so
it
does
matter
he
said
it
matters
confoundedly
be
good
enough
to
take
your
place
in
the
he
moved
to
the
carriage
door
and
not
too
civilly
put
her
in
she
gasped
a
little
for
breath
as
she
sat
down
he
had
spoken
to
her
as
if
she
had
been
an
impertinent
servant
who
had
taken
a
liberty
the
poor
girl
was
bewildered
to
the
verge
of
panic
when
he
had
ended
his
tirade
and
took
his
place
beside
her
he
wore
his
most
haughtily
intolerant
air
may
i
request
that
in
future
you
will
be
good
enough
not
to
interfere
when
i
am
reproving
my
servants
he
remarked
i
did
mean
to
interfere
she
apologised
tremulously
i
do
know
what
you
meant
i
only
know
what
you
did
was
his
response
you
american
women
are
too
fond
of
cutting
in
an
englishman
can
think
for
himself
without
his
wife
the
tears
rose
to
her
eyes
the
introduction
of
the
international
question
overpowered
her
as
always
do
begin
to
be
hysterical
was
the
ameliorating
tenderness
with
which
he
observed
the
two
hot
salt
drops
which
fell
despite
her
i
should
scarcely
wish
to
present
you
to
my
mother
bathed
in
she
wiped
the
salt
drops
hastily
away
and
sat
for
a
moment
silent
in
the
corner
of
the
carriage
being
wholly
primitive
and
unanalytical
she
was
ashamed
and
began
to
blame
herself
he
was
right
she
must
not
be
silly
because
she
was
unused
to
things
she
ought
not
to
be
disturbed
by
trifles
she
must
try
to
be
nice
and
look
cheerful
she
made
an
effort
and
did
no
speak
for
a
few
minutes
when
she
had
recovered
herself
she
tried
again
english
country
is
so
pretty
she
said
when
she
thought
she
was
quite
sure
that
her
voice
would
not
tremble
i
do
so
like
the
hedges
and
the
darling
little
it
was
an
innocent
tentative
at
saying
something
agreeable
which
might
propitiate
him
she
was
beginning
to
realise
that
she
was
continually
making
efforts
to
propitiate
him
but
one
of
the
forms
of
unpleasantness
most
enjoyable
to
him
was
the
snubbing
of
any
gentle
effort
at
palliating
his
mood
he
condescended
in
this
case
no
response
whatever
but
merely
continued
staring
contemptuously
before
him
it
is
so
picturesque
and
so
unlike
america
was
the
pathetic
little
commonplace
she
ventured
next
ai
it
nigel
he
turned
his
head
slowly
towards
her
as
if
she
had
taken
a
new
liberty
in
disturbing
his
meditations
wha
at
he
drawled
it
was
almost
too
much
for
her
to
sustain
herself
under
her
courage
collapsed
i
was
only
saying
how
pretty
the
cottages
were
she
faltered
and
that
there
nothing
like
this
in
you
ended
your
remark
by
adding
it
her
husband
condescended
there
is
nothing
like
that
in
england
i
shall
ask
you
to
do
me
the
favour
of
leaving
americanisms
out
of
your
conversation
when
you
are
in
the
society
of
english
ladies
and
gentlemen
it
wo
i
did
know
i
said
it
rosy
answered
feebly
that
is
the
difficulty
was
his
response
you
never
know
but
educated
people
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
said
at
least
for
a
girl
who
had
never
known
what
it
was
to
be
bullied
this
one
felt
like
a
beggar
or
a
scullery
maid
who
being
rated
by
her
master
had
not
the
refuge
of
being
able
to
give
she
could
never
give
warning
the
atlantic
ocean
was
between
her
and
those
who
had
loved
and
protected
her
all
her
short
life
and
the
carriage
was
bearing
her
onwards
to
the
home
in
which
she
was
to
live
alone
as
this
man
companion
to
the
end
of
her
existence
she
made
no
further
propitiatory
efforts
but
sat
and
stared
in
simple
blankness
at
the
country
which
seemed
to
increase
in
loveliness
at
each
new
point
of
view
sometimes
she
saw
sweet
wooded
rolling
lands
made
lovelier
by
the
homely
farmhouses
and
cottages
enclosed
and
sheltered
by
thick
hedges
and
trees
once
or
twice
they
drove
past
a
park
enfolding
a
great
house
guarded
by
its
huge
sentinel
oaks
and
beeches
once
the
carriage
passed
through
an
adorable
little
village
where
children
played
on
the
green
and
a
grey
church
seemed
to
watch
over
the
cottages
and
vicarage
if
she
had
been
a
happy
american
tourist
travelling
in
company
with
impressionable
friends
she
would
have
broken
into
ecstatic
little
exclamations
of
admiration
every
five
minutes
but
it
had
been
driven
home
to
her
that
to
her
present
companion
to
whom
nothing
was
new
her
rapture
would
merely
represent
the
crudeness
which
had
existed
in
contentment
in
a
house
on
a
noisy
thoroughfare
through
a
life
which
had
been
passed
tramping
up
and
down
numbered
streets
and
avenues
they
approached
at
last
a
second
village
with
a
green
a
street
and
the
irregular
cottages
which
to
the
unaccustomed
eye
seemed
rather
to
represent
studies
for
sketches
than
absolute
realities
the
bells
in
the
church
tower
broke
forth
into
a
chime
and
people
appeared
at
the
doors
of
the
cottages
the
men
touched
their
foreheads
as
the
carriage
passed
and
the
children
made
bobbing
curtsies
sir
nigel
condescended
to
straighten
himself
a
trifle
in
his
seat
and
recognised
the
greetings
with
the
stiff
salute
the
poor
girl
at
his
side
felt
that
he
put
as
little
feeling
as
possible
into
the
movement
and
that
if
she
herself
had
been
a
bowing
villager
she
would
almost
have
preferred
to
be
wholly
ignored
she
looked
at
him
questioningly
are
they
must
she
began
make
some
civil
recognition
answered
sir
nigel
as
if
he
were
instructing
an
ignorant
child
it
is
so
she
bowed
and
tried
to
smile
and
the
joyous
clamour
of
the
bells
brought
the
awful
lump
into
her
throat
again
it
reminded
her
of
the
ringing
of
the
chimes
at
the
new
york
church
on
that
day
of
her
marriage
which
had
been
so
full
of
gay
luxurious
bustle
so
crowded
with
wedding
presents
and
flowers
and
affectionate
congratulations
and
good
wishes
uttered
in
merry
american
voices
the
park
at
stornham
court
was
large
and
beautiful
and
old
the
trees
were
magnificent
and
the
broad
sweep
of
sward
and
rich
dip
of
ferny
dell
all
that
the
imagination
could
desire
the
court
itself
was
old
and
and
and
fine
rosalie
had
learned
from
no
precedent
as
yet
that
houses
of
its
kind
may
represent
the
apotheosis
of
discomfort
and
dilapidation
within
and
only
become
more
beautiful
without
chimneys
and
broken
tiles
being
clambered
over
by
tossing
ivy
are
pictures
to
delight
the
soul
as
she
descended
from
the
carriage
the
girl
was
tremulous
and
uncertain
of
herself
and
much
overpowered
by
the
unbending
air
of
the
who
received
her
as
if
she
were
a
parcel
in
which
it
was
no
part
of
his
duty
to
take
the
smallest
interest
as
she
mounted
the
stone
steps
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
broad
gloom
within
the
threshold
a
big
square
dingy
hall
where
some
other
servants
were
drawn
up
in
a
row
she
had
read
of
something
of
the
sort
in
english
novels
and
she
was
suddenly
embarrassed
afresh
by
her
realisation
of
the
fact
that
she
did
not
know
what
to
do
and
that
if
she
made
a
mistake
nigel
would
never
forgive
her
an
elderly
woman
came
out
of
a
room
opening
into
the
hall
she
was
an
ugly
woman
of
a
rigid
carriage
which
with
the
obvious
intention
of
being
severely
majestic
was
only
antagonistic
she
had
a
flaccid
chin
and
was
curiously
like
nigel
she
had
also
his
expression
when
he
intended
to
be
disagreeable
she
was
the
dowager
lady
anstruthers
and
being
an
entirely
revolting
old
person
at
her
best
she
objected
extremely
to
the
transatlantic
bride
who
had
made
her
a
dowager
though
she
was
determinedly
prepared
to
profit
by
any
practical
benefit
likely
to
accrue
well
nigel
she
said
in
a
deep
voice
here
you
are
at
this
was
of
course
a
statement
not
to
be
refuted
she
held
out
a
leathern
cheek
and
as
sir
nigel
also
presented
his
their
caress
of
greeting
was
a
singular
and
not
effusive
one
is
this
your
wife
she
asked
giving
rosalie
a
bony
hand
and
as
he
did
not
indignantly
deny
this
to
be
the
fact
she
added
how
do
you
do
rosalie
murmured
a
reply
and
tried
to
control
herself
by
making
another
effort
to
swallow
the
lump
in
her
throat
but
she
could
not
swallow
it
she
had
been
keeping
a
desperate
hold
on
herself
too
long
the
bewildered
misery
of
her
awakening
the
awkwardness
of
the
public
row
at
the
station
the
sulks
which
had
filled
the
carriage
to
repletion
through
all
the
long
drive
and
finally
the
jangling
bells
which
had
so
recalled
that
last
joyous
day
at
home
at
home
had
brought
her
to
a
point
where
this
meeting
between
mother
and
son
these
two
stony
unpleasant
creatures
exchanging
a
reluctant
rub
of
uninviting
cheeks
as
two
savages
might
have
rubbed
noses
proved
the
finishing
impetus
to
hysteria
they
were
so
hideous
these
two
and
so
ghastly
comic
and
fantastic
in
their
unresponsive
glumness
that
the
poor
girl
lost
all
hold
upon
herself
and
broke
into
a
trembling
shriek
of
laughter
oh
she
gasped
in
terror
at
what
she
felt
to
be
her
indecent
madness
oh
how
how
and
then
seeing
nigel
furious
start
his
glare
and
all
the
servants
alarmed
stare
at
her
she
rushed
staggering
to
the
only
creature
she
felt
she
knew
her
maid
hannah
clutched
her
and
broke
down
into
wild
sobbing
oh
take
me
away
she
cried
oh
do
oh
do
oh
hannah
oh
mother
mother
take
your
mistress
to
her
room
commanded
sir
nigel
go
downstairs
he
called
out
to
the
servants
take
her
upstairs
at
once
and
throw
water
in
her
face
to
the
excited
hannah
and
as
the
new
lady
anstruthers
was
half
led
half
dragged
in
humiliated
hysteric
disorder
up
the
staircase
he
took
his
mother
by
the
elbow
marched
her
into
the
nearest
room
and
shut
the
door
there
they
stood
and
stared
at
each
other
breathing
quick
enraged
breaths
and
looking
particularly
alike
with
their
infuriated
faces
it
was
the
dowager
who
spoke
first
and
her
whole
voice
and
manner
expressed
all
she
intended
that
they
should
all
the
derision
dislike
and
scathing
resignment
to
a
grotesque
fate
well
said
her
ladyship
so
this
is
what
you
have
brought
home
from
america
chapter
iv
a
mistake
of
the
as
the
weeks
passed
at
stornham
court
the
atlantic
ocean
seemed
to
rosalie
anstruthers
to
widen
endlessly
and
gay
happy
noisy
new
york
to
recede
until
it
was
as
far
away
as
some
memory
of
heaven
the
girl
had
been
born
in
the
midst
of
the
rattling
rumbling
bustle
and
it
had
never
struck
her
as
assuming
the
character
of
noise
she
had
only
thought
of
it
as
being
the
cheerful
confusion
inseparable
from
town
she
had
been
secretly
offended
and
hurt
when
strangers
said
that
new
york
was
noisy
and
dirty
when
they
called
it
vulgar
she
never
wholly
forgave
them
she
was
of
the
new
yorkers
who
adore
their
new
york
as
parisians
adore
paris
and
who
feel
that
only
within
its
beloved
boundaries
can
the
breath
of
life
be
breathed
people
were
often
too
hot
or
too
cold
there
but
there
was
usually
plenty
of
bright
glaring
sun
and
the
extremes
of
the
weather
had
at
least
something
rather
dramatic
about
them
there
were
dramatic
incidents
connected
with
them
at
any
rate
people
fell
dead
of
sunstroke
or
were
frozen
to
death
and
the
newspapers
were
full
of
anecdotes
during
a
cold
snap
or
a
torrid
wave
which
all
made
for
excitement
and
conversation
but
at
stornham
the
rain
seemed
to
young
lady
anstruthers
to
descend
ceaselessly
the
season
was
a
wet
one
and
when
she
rose
in
the
morning
and
looked
out
over
the
huge
stretch
of
trees
and
sward
she
thought
she
always
saw
the
rain
falling
either
in
hopeless
sheets
or
more
hopeless
drizzle
the
occasions
upon
which
this
was
a
dreary
truth
blotted
out
or
blurred
the
exceptions
when
in
liquid
ultramarine
deeps
of
sky
floated
islands
and
mountains
of
fleece
of
a
beauty
of
which
she
had
before
had
no
conception
in
the
english
novels
she
had
read
places
such
as
stornham
court
were
always
filled
with
house
parties
made
up
of
wonderful
town
wits
and
beauties
who
provided
endless
entertainment
for
each
other
who
played
games
who
hunted
and
shot
pheasants
and
shone
in
dazzling
amateur
theatricals
there
were
however
no
visitors
at
stornham
and
there
were
in
fact
no
accommodations
for
any
there
were
numberless
bedrooms
but
none
really
fit
for
guests
to
occupy
carpets
and
curtains
were
ancient
and
ragged
furniture
was
dilapidated
chimneys
would
not
draw
beds
were
falling
to
pieces
the
dowager
lady
anstruthers
had
never
either
attracted
desired
or
been
able
to
afford
company
her
son
wife
suffered
from
the
resulting
boredom
and
unpopularity
without
being
able
to
comprehend
the
significance
of
the
situation
as
the
weeks
dragged
by
a
few
heavy
carriages
deposited
at
the
court
a
few
callers
some
of
the
visitors
bore
imposing
titles
which
made
rosalie
very
nervous
and
caused
her
hastily
to
array
herself
to
receive
them
in
toilettes
much
too
pretty
and
delicate
for
the
occasion
her
innocent
idea
was
that
she
must
do
her
husband
credit
by
appearing
as
stylish
as
possible
as
a
result
she
was
stared
at
either
with
open
disfavour
or
with
furtive
criticism
and
was
described
afterwards
as
being
either
very
american
or
very
when
she
had
lived
in
huge
rooms
in
fifth
avenue
rosalie
had
changed
her
attire
as
many
times
a
day
as
she
had
changed
her
fancy
every
hour
had
been
filled
with
engagements
and
amusements
the
vanderpoel
carriages
had
driven
up
to
the
door
and
driven
away
again
and
again
through
the
mornings
and
afternoons
and
until
midnight
and
later
someone
was
always
going
out
or
coming
in
there
had
been
in
the
big
handsome
house
not
much
more
of
an
air
of
repose
than
one
might
expect
to
find
at
a
railway
station
but
the
flurry
the
coming
and
going
the
calling
and
chatting
had
all
been
cheery
amiable
at
stornham
rosalie
sat
at
breakfast
before
unchanging
boiled
eggs
unfailing
toast
and
unalterable
broiled
bacon
morning
after
morning
sir
nigel
sat
and
munched
over
the
newspapers
his
mother
with
an
air
of
relentless
disapproval
from
a
lofty
height
of
both
her
food
and
companions
disposed
of
her
eggs
and
her
rasher
at
rosalie
right
hand
she
had
transferred
to
her
her
previously
occupied
seat
at
the
head
of
the
table
this
had
been
done
with
a
carefully
prepared
scene
of
intense
though
correct
disagreeableness
in
which
she
had
managed
to
convey
all
the
rancour
of
her
dethroned
spirit
and
her
disapproval
and
disdain
of
international
alliances
it
is
of
course
proper
that
you
should
sit
at
the
head
of
your
husband
table
she
had
said
among
other
agreeable
things
a
woman
having
devoted
her
life
to
her
son
must
relinquish
her
position
to
the
person
he
chooses
to
marry
if
you
should
have
a
son
you
will
give
up
your
position
to
his
wife
since
nigel
has
married
you
he
has
of
course
a
right
to
expect
that
you
will
at
least
make
an
effort
to
learn
something
of
what
is
required
of
women
of
your
sit
down
rosalie
said
nigel
of
course
you
take
the
head
of
the
table
and
naturally
you
must
learn
what
is
expected
of
my
wife
but
do
talk
confounded
rubbish
mother
about
devoting
your
life
to
your
son
we
have
seen
about
as
little
of
each
other
as
we
could
help
we
never
they
were
both
bullies
and
each
made
occasional
efforts
at
bullying
the
other
without
any
particular
result
but
each
could
at
least
bully
the
other
into
intensified
unpleasantness
the
vicar
wife
having
made
her
call
of
ceremony
upon
the
new
lady
anstruthers
followed
up
the
acquaintance
and
found
her
quite
exotically
unlike
her
whose
charities
one
may
be
sure
had
neither
been
lavish
nor
dispensed
by
any
hand
less
impressive
than
her
own
the
younger
woman
was
of
wholly
malleable
material
her
sympathies
were
easily
awakened
and
her
purse
was
well
filled
and
readily
opened
small
families
or
large
ones
newly
born
infants
or
newly
buried
ones
old
women
with
bad
legs
and
old
men
who
needed
comforts
equally
touched
her
heart
she
innocently
bestowed
sovereigns
where
an
englishwoman
would
have
known
that
would
have
been
sufficient
as
the
vicaress
was
her
almoner
that
lady
felt
her
importance
rapidly
on
the
increase
when
she
left
a
cottage
saying
i
speak
to
young
lady
anstruthers
about
you
the
good
woman
of
the
house
curtsied
low
and
her
husband
touched
his
forehead
respectfully
but
this
did
not
advance
the
fortunes
of
sir
nigel
who
personally
required
of
her
very
different
things
two
weeks
after
her
arrival
at
stornham
rosalie
began
to
see
that
somehow
she
was
regarded
as
a
person
almost
impudently
in
the
wrong
it
appeared
that
if
she
had
been
an
english
girl
she
would
have
been
quite
different
that
she
would
have
been
an
advantage
instead
of
a
detriment
as
an
american
she
was
a
detriment
that
seemed
to
go
without
saying
she
tried
to
do
everything
she
was
told
and
learn
something
from
each
cold
insinuation
she
did
not
know
that
her
very
amenability
and
timidity
were
her
undoing
sir
nigel
and
his
mother
thoroughly
enjoyed
themselves
at
her
expense
they
knew
they
could
say
anything
they
chose
and
that
at
the
most
she
would
only
break
down
into
crying
and
afterwards
apologise
for
being
so
badly
behaved
if
some
practical
person
had
been
near
to
defend
her
she
might
have
been
rescued
promptly
and
her
tyrants
routed
but
she
was
a
young
girl
tender
of
heart
and
weak
of
nature
she
used
to
cry
a
great
deal
when
she
was
alone
and
when
she
wrote
to
her
mother
she
was
too
frightened
to
tell
the
truth
concerning
her
unhappiness
oh
if
i
could
just
see
some
of
them
she
would
wail
to
herself
if
i
could
just
see
mother
or
father
or
anybody
from
new
york
oh
i
know
i
shall
never
see
new
york
again
or
broadway
or
fifth
avenue
or
central
park
i
never
never
never
shall
and
she
would
grovel
among
her
pillows
burying
her
face
and
half
stifling
herself
lest
her
sobs
should
be
heard
her
feeling
for
her
husband
had
become
one
of
terror
and
repulsion
she
was
almost
more
afraid
of
his
patronising
affectionate
moments
than
she
was
of
his
temper
his
conjugal
condescensions
made
her
feel
vaguely
without
knowing
why
as
if
she
were
some
lower
order
of
little
animal
american
women
he
said
had
no
conception
of
wifely
duties
and
affection
he
had
a
great
deal
to
say
on
the
subject
of
wifely
duty
it
was
part
of
her
duty
as
a
wife
to
be
entirely
satisfied
with
his
society
and
to
be
completely
happy
in
the
pleasure
it
afforded
her
it
was
her
wifely
duty
not
to
talk
about
her
own
family
and
palpitatingly
expect
letters
by
every
american
mail
he
objected
intensely
to
this
letter
writing
and
receiving
and
his
mother
shared
his
prejudices
you
have
married
an
englishman
her
ladyship
said
you
have
put
it
out
of
his
power
to
marry
an
englishwoman
and
the
least
consideration
you
can
show
is
to
let
new
york
and
street
remain
upon
the
other
side
of
the
atlantic
and
not
insist
on
dragging
them
into
stornham
the
dowager
lady
anstruthers
was
very
fine
in
her
picture
of
her
mental
condition
when
she
realised
as
she
seemed
periodically
to
do
that
it
was
no
longer
possible
for
her
son
to
make
a
respectable
marriage
with
a
woman
of
his
own
nation
the
unadorned
fact
was
that
both
she
and
sir
nigel
were
infuriated
by
the
simplicity
which
made
rosalie
slow
in
comprehending
that
it
was
proper
that
the
money
her
father
allowed
her
should
be
placed
in
her
husband
hands
and
left
there
with
no
indelicate
questioning
if
she
had
been
an
english
girl
matters
would
have
been
made
plain
to
her
from
the
first
and
arranged
satisfactorily
before
her
marriage
sir
nigel
mother
considered
that
he
had
played
the
fool
and
would
not
believe
that
new
york
fathers
were
such
touchy
sentimental
idiots
as
not
to
know
what
was
expected
of
them
they
wasted
no
time
however
in
coming
to
the
point
and
in
a
measure
it
was
the
vicaress
who
aided
them
not
she
entirely
however
since
her
first
mention
of
a
possible
son
whose
wife
would
eventually
thrust
her
from
her
seat
at
the
head
of
the
table
rosalie
had
several
times
heard
this
son
referred
to
it
struck
her
that
in
england
such
things
seemed
discussed
with
more
freedom
than
in
america
she
had
never
heard
a
young
woman
possible
family
arranged
for
and
made
the
subject
of
conversation
in
the
more
crude
atmosphere
of
new
york
it
made
her
feel
rather
awkward
at
first
then
she
began
to
realise
that
the
son
was
part
of
her
wifely
duty
also
that
she
was
expected
to
provide
one
and
that
he
was
in
some
way
expected
to
provide
for
the
estate
to
rehabilitate
it
and
that
this
was
because
her
father
being
a
rich
man
would
provide
for
him
it
had
also
struck
her
that
in
england
there
was
a
tendency
to
expectation
that
someone
would
provide
for
someone
else
that
relatives
even
by
marriage
were
supposed
to
make
allowances
on
which
it
was
quite
proper
for
other
persons
to
live
rosalie
had
been
accustomed
to
a
community
in
which
even
rich
men
worked
and
in
which
young
and
men
would
have
felt
rather
indignant
if
aunts
or
uncles
had
thought
it
necessary
to
pension
them
off
as
if
they
had
been
impotent
paupers
it
was
son
who
was
to
be
provided
for
in
this
case
and
who
was
to
provide
for
his
father
when
you
have
a
son
her
had
remarked
severely
i
suppose
something
will
be
done
for
nigel
and
the
this
had
been
said
before
she
had
been
ten
days
in
the
house
and
had
set
her
brain
working
she
had
already
begun
to
see
that
life
at
stornham
court
was
not
the
luxurious
affair
it
was
in
the
house
in
fifth
avenue
things
were
shabby
and
queer
and
not
at
all
comfortable
fires
were
not
lighted
because
a
day
was
chilly
and
gloomy
she
had
once
asked
for
one
in
her
bedroom
and
her
had
reproved
her
for
indecent
extravagance
in
a
manner
which
took
her
breath
away
i
suppose
in
america
you
have
your
house
at
furnace
heat
in
july
she
said
mere
wastefulness
and
that
is
why
americans
are
old
women
at
twenty
they
are
shrivelled
and
withered
by
the
unhealthy
lives
they
lead
stuffing
themselves
with
sweets
and
hot
bread
and
never
breathing
the
fresh
rosalie
could
not
at
the
moment
recall
any
withered
and
shrivelled
old
women
of
twenty
but
she
blushed
and
stammered
as
usual
it
is
never
cold
enough
for
fires
in
july
she
answered
but
we
we
never
think
fires
extravagant
when
we
are
not
comfortable
without
coal
must
be
cheaper
than
it
is
in
england
said
her
ladyship
when
you
have
a
daughter
i
hope
you
do
not
expect
to
bring
her
up
as
girls
are
brought
up
in
new
this
was
the
first
time
rosalie
had
heard
of
her
daughter
and
she
was
not
ready
enough
to
reply
she
naturally
went
into
her
room
and
cried
again
wondering
what
her
father
and
mother
would
say
if
they
knew
that
bedroom
fires
were
considered
vulgarly
extravagant
by
an
impressive
member
of
the
british
aristocracy
she
was
not
at
all
strong
at
the
time
and
was
given
to
feeling
chilly
and
miserable
on
wet
windy
days
she
used
to
cry
more
than
ever
and
was
so
desolate
that
there
were
days
when
she
used
to
go
to
the
vicarage
for
companionship
on
such
days
the
vicar
wife
would
entertain
her
with
stories
of
the
villagers
catastrophes
and
she
would
empty
her
purse
upon
the
tea
table
and
feel
a
little
consoled
because
she
was
the
means
of
consoling
someone
else
i
suppose
it
gratifies
your
vanity
to
play
the
lady
bountiful
sir
nigel
sneered
one
evening
having
heard
in
the
village
what
she
was
doing
i
never
thought
of
such
a
thing
she
stammered
feebly
mrs
brent
said
they
were
so
you
throw
your
money
about
as
if
you
were
a
child
said
her
it
is
a
pity
it
is
not
put
in
the
hands
of
some
person
with
it
had
begun
to
dawn
upon
rosalie
that
her
ladyship
was
deeply
convinced
that
either
herself
or
her
son
would
be
admirably
discreet
custodians
of
the
money
referred
to
and
even
the
dawning
of
this
idea
had
frightened
the
girl
she
was
so
inexperienced
and
ignorant
that
she
felt
it
might
be
possible
that
in
england
one
husband
and
one
could
do
what
they
liked
it
might
be
that
they
could
take
possession
of
money
as
they
seemed
to
take
possession
of
one
self
and
one
very
soul
she
would
have
been
very
glad
to
give
them
money
and
had
indeed
wondered
frequently
if
she
might
dare
to
offer
it
to
them
if
they
would
be
outraged
and
insulted
and
slay
her
in
their
wrath
at
her
daring
she
had
tried
to
invent
ways
in
which
she
could
approach
the
subject
but
had
not
been
able
to
screw
up
her
courage
to
any
sticking
point
she
was
so
overpowered
by
her
consciousness
that
they
seemed
continually
to
intimate
that
americans
with
money
were
ostentatious
and
always
laying
stress
upon
the
amount
of
their
possessions
she
had
no
conception
of
the
primeval
simpleness
of
their
attitude
in
such
matters
and
that
no
ceremonies
were
necessary
save
the
process
of
transferring
sufficiently
large
sums
as
though
they
were
the
mere
right
of
the
recipients
she
was
taught
to
understand
this
later
in
the
meantime
however
ready
as
she
would
have
been
to
give
large
sums
if
she
had
known
how
she
was
terrified
by
the
thought
that
it
might
be
possible
that
she
could
be
deprived
of
her
bank
account
and
reduced
to
the
condition
of
a
sort
of
dependent
upon
the
humours
of
her
lately
acquired
relations
she
thought
over
this
a
good
deal
and
would
have
found
immense
relief
if
she
dared
have
consulted
anyone
but
she
could
not
make
up
her
mind
to
reveal
her
unhappiness
to
her
people
she
had
been
married
so
recently
everybody
had
thought
her
marriage
so
delightful
she
could
not
bear
that
her
father
and
mother
should
be
distressed
by
knowing
that
she
was
wretched
she
also
reflected
with
misery
that
new
york
would
talk
the
matter
over
excitedly
and
that
finally
the
newspapers
would
get
hold
of
the
gossip
she
could
even
imagine
interviewers
calling
at
the
house
in
fifth
avenue
and
endeavouring
to
obtain
particulars
of
the
situation
her
father
would
be
angry
and
refuse
to
give
them
but
that
would
make
no
difference
the
newspapers
would
give
them
and
everybody
would
read
what
they
said
whether
it
was
true
or
not
she
could
not
possibly
write
facts
she
thought
so
her
poor
little
letters
were
restrained
and
unlike
herself
and
to
the
souls
in
new
york
even
appearing
stiff
and
unaffectionate
as
if
her
aristocratic
surroundings
had
chilled
her
love
for
them
in
fact
it
became
far
from
easy
for
her
to
write
at
all
since
sir
nigel
so
disapproved
of
her
interest
in
the
american
mail
his
objections
had
indeed
taken
the
form
of
his
feeling
himself
quite
within
his
rights
when
he
occasionally
intercepted
letters
from
her
relations
with
a
view
of
finding
out
whether
they
contained
criticisms
of
himself
which
would
betray
that
she
had
been
guilty
of
indiscreet
confidences
he
discovered
that
she
had
not
apparently
been
so
guilty
but
it
was
evident
that
there
were
moments
when
vanderpoel
was
uneasy
and
disposed
to
ask
anxious
questions
when
this
occurred
he
destroyed
the
letters
and
as
a
result
of
this
precaution
on
his
part
her
motherly
queries
seemed
to
be
ignored
and
she
several
times
shed
tears
in
the
belief
that
rosy
had
grown
so
patrician
that
she
was
capable
of
snubbing
her
mother
in
her
resentment
at
feeling
her
privacy
intruded
upon
and
an
unrefined
effusiveness
shown
i
just
feel
as
if
she
was
beginning
not
to
care
about
us
at
all
betty
she
said
i
could
have
believed
it
of
rosy
she
was
always
such
an
affectionate
i
do
believe
it
now
replied
betty
sharply
rosy
could
grow
hateful
and
stuck
up
it
that
nasty
nigel
i
know
it
sir
nigel
intention
was
that
there
should
be
as
little
intercourse
between
fifth
avenue
and
stornham
court
as
was
possible
among
other
things
he
did
not
intend
that
a
lot
of
american
relations
should
come
tumbling
in
when
they
chose
to
cross
the
atlantic
he
would
not
have
it
and
took
discreet
steps
to
prevent
any
accident
of
the
sort
he
wrote
to
america
occasionally
himself
and
knowing
well
how
to
make
himself
civilly
repellent
so
subtly
chilled
his
as
to
discourage
in
them
more
than
once
their
plan
of
paying
a
visit
to
their
child
in
her
new
home
he
opened
read
and
reclosed
all
epistles
to
and
from
new
york
and
while
vanderpoel
was
much
hurt
to
find
that
rosalie
never
condescended
to
make
any
response
to
her
tentatives
concerning
her
possible
visit
rosalie
herself
was
mystified
by
the
fact
that
the
journey
to
europe
was
never
spoken
of
i
do
see
why
they
never
seem
to
think
of
coming
over
she
said
plaintively
one
day
they
used
to
talk
so
much
about
they
ejaculated
the
dowager
lady
anstruthers
whom
may
you
mean
mother
and
father
and
betty
and
some
of
the
her
put
up
her
to
stare
at
her
the
whole
family
she
inquired
there
are
not
so
many
of
them
rosalie
answered
a
family
is
always
too
many
to
descend
upon
a
young
woman
when
she
is
married
observed
her
ladyship
unmovedly
nigel
glanced
over
the
top
of
his
times
i
may
as
well
tell
you
that
it
would
not
do
at
all
he
put
in
why
why
not
exclaimed
rosalie
aghast
americans
do
do
in
english
society
slightingly
but
they
are
coming
over
so
much
they
like
london
so
all
americans
like
do
they
with
a
drawl
which
made
rosalie
blush
until
the
tears
started
to
her
eyes
i
am
afraid
the
sentiment
is
scarcely
rosalie
turned
and
fled
from
the
room
she
turned
and
fled
because
she
realised
that
she
should
burst
out
crying
if
she
waited
to
hear
another
word
and
she
realised
that
of
late
she
seemed
always
to
be
bursting
out
crying
before
one
or
the
other
of
those
two
she
could
not
help
it
they
always
seemed
to
be
implying
something
slighting
or
scathing
they
were
always
putting
her
in
the
wrong
and
hurting
her
feelings
the
day
was
damp
and
chill
but
she
put
on
her
hat
and
ran
out
into
the
park
she
went
down
the
avenue
and
turned
into
a
coppice
there
among
the
wet
bracken
she
sank
down
on
the
mossy
trunk
of
a
fallen
tree
and
huddled
herself
in
a
small
heap
her
head
on
her
arms
actually
wailing
oh
mother
oh
mother
she
cried
hysterically
oh
i
do
wish
you
would
come
i
so
cold
mother
i
so
ill
i
ca
bear
it
it
seems
as
if
you
forgotten
all
about
me
you
all
so
happy
in
new
york
that
perhaps
you
have
forgotten
perhaps
you
have
oh
do
mother
do
it
was
a
month
later
that
through
the
vicar
wife
she
reached
a
discovery
and
a
climax
she
had
heard
one
morning
from
this
lady
of
a
misfortune
which
had
befallen
a
small
farmer
it
was
a
misfortune
which
was
an
actual
catastrophe
to
a
man
in
his
position
his
house
had
caught
fire
during
a
gale
of
wind
and
the
fire
had
spread
to
the
outbuildings
and
rickyard
and
swept
away
all
his
belongings
his
house
his
furniture
his
hayricks
and
stored
grain
and
even
his
few
cows
and
horses
he
had
been
a
poor
fellow
and
his
small
insurance
had
lapsed
the
day
before
the
fire
he
was
absolutely
ruined
and
with
his
wife
and
six
children
stood
face
to
face
with
beggary
and
starvation
rosalie
anstruthers
entered
the
vicarage
to
find
the
poor
woman
who
was
his
companion
in
calamity
sobbing
in
the
hall
a
child
of
a
few
weeks
was
in
her
arms
and
two
small
creatures
clung
crying
to
her
skirts
we
worked
hard
she
wept
we
have
father
he
always
been
steady
an
up
early
an
late
it
the
lord
as
you
say
but
we
been
decent
people
an
never
missed
church
when
we
could
it
father
did
deserve
it
that
he
she
was
heartbroken
in
her
downtrodden
hopelessness
rosalie
literally
quaked
with
sympathy
she
poured
forth
her
pity
in
such
words
as
the
poor
woman
had
never
heard
spoken
by
a
great
lady
to
a
humble
creature
like
herself
the
villagers
found
the
new
lady
anstruthers
interviews
with
them
curiously
simple
and
suggestive
of
an
equality
they
could
not
understand
stornham
was
a
conservative
old
village
where
the
distinction
between
the
gentry
and
the
peasants
was
clearly
marked
the
cottagers
were
puzzled
by
sir
nigel
wife
but
they
decided
that
she
was
kind
if
unusual
as
rosalie
talked
to
the
farmer
wife
she
longed
for
her
presence
she
had
remembered
a
time
when
a
man
in
his
employ
had
lost
his
all
by
fire
the
small
house
he
had
just
made
his
last
payment
upon
having
been
burned
to
the
ground
he
had
lost
one
of
his
children
in
the
fire
and
the
details
had
been
heartrending
the
entire
vanderpoel
household
had
wept
on
hearing
them
and
vanderpoel
had
drawn
a
cheque
which
had
seemed
like
a
fortune
to
the
sufferer
a
new
house
had
been
bought
and
vanderpoel
and
her
daughters
and
friends
had
bestowed
furniture
and
clothing
enough
to
make
the
family
comfortable
to
the
verge
of
luxury
see
you
poor
thing
said
rosalie
glowing
with
memories
of
this
incident
her
homesick
young
soul
comforted
by
the
mere
likeness
in
the
two
calamities
i
brought
my
cheque
book
with
me
because
i
meant
to
help
you
a
man
worked
for
my
father
had
his
house
burned
just
as
yours
was
and
my
father
made
everything
all
right
for
him
again
i
make
it
all
right
for
you
i
make
you
a
cheque
for
a
hundred
pounds
now
and
then
when
your
husband
begins
to
build
i
give
him
some
the
woman
gasped
for
breath
and
turned
pale
she
was
frightened
it
really
seemed
as
if
her
ladyship
must
have
lost
her
wits
a
little
she
could
not
mean
this
the
vicaress
turned
pale
also
lady
anstruthers
she
said
lady
anstruthers
it
it
is
too
much
sir
nigel
too
much
exclaimed
rosalie
they
have
lost
everything
you
know
their
hayricks
and
cattle
as
well
as
their
house
i
guess
it
wo
be
half
brent
dragged
her
into
the
vicar
study
and
talked
to
her
she
tried
to
explain
that
in
english
villages
such
things
were
not
done
in
a
manner
so
casual
as
if
they
were
the
mere
result
of
unconsidered
feeling
as
if
they
were
quite
natural
things
such
as
any
human
person
might
do
when
rosalie
cried
but
why
not
why
not
they
ought
to
brent
could
not
seem
to
make
herself
quite
clear
rosalie
only
gathered
in
a
bewildered
way
that
there
ought
to
be
more
ceremony
more
deliberation
more
holding
off
before
a
person
of
rank
indulged
in
such
munificence
the
recipient
ought
to
be
made
to
feel
it
more
to
understand
fully
what
a
great
thing
was
being
done
they
will
think
you
will
do
anything
for
so
i
will
said
young
lady
anstruthers
if
i
have
the
money
when
they
are
in
such
awful
trouble
suppose
we
lost
everything
in
the
world
and
there
were
people
who
could
easily
help
us
and
would
you
and
sir
nigel
that
is
quite
different
said
brent
i
am
afraid
that
if
you
do
not
discuss
the
matter
and
ask
advice
from
your
husband
and
they
will
be
very
much
if
i
were
doing
it
with
their
money
they
would
have
the
right
to
be
replied
rosalie
with
entire
ingenuousness
i
would
presume
to
do
such
a
thing
as
that
that
would
be
right
of
they
will
be
angry
with
me
said
the
vicaress
awkwardly
this
queer
silly
girl
who
seemed
to
see
nothing
in
the
right
light
frequently
made
her
feel
awkward
brent
told
her
husband
that
she
appeared
to
have
no
sense
of
dignity
or
proper
appreciation
of
her
position
the
wife
of
the
farmer
john
wilson
carried
away
the
cheque
quite
stunned
she
was
breathless
with
amazement
and
turned
rather
faint
with
excitement
bewilderment
and
her
sense
of
relief
she
had
to
sit
down
in
the
vicarage
kitchen
for
a
few
minutes
and
drink
a
glass
of
the
thin
vicarage
beer
rosalie
promised
that
she
would
discuss
the
matter
and
ask
advice
when
she
returned
to
the
court
just
as
she
left
the
house
brent
suddenly
remembered
something
she
had
forgotten
the
wilson
trouble
completely
drove
it
out
of
my
mind
she
said
it
was
a
stupid
mistake
of
the
postboy
he
left
a
letter
of
yours
among
mine
when
he
came
this
morning
it
was
most
careless
i
shall
speak
to
his
father
about
it
it
might
have
been
important
that
you
should
receive
it
when
she
saw
the
letter
rosalie
uttered
an
exclamation
it
was
addressed
in
her
father
handwriting
oh
she
cried
it
from
father
and
the
postmark
is
havre
what
does
it
mean
she
was
so
excited
that
she
almost
forgot
to
express
her
thanks
her
heart
leaped
up
in
her
throat
could
they
have
come
over
from
america
could
they
why
was
it
written
from
havre
could
they
be
near
her
she
walked
along
the
road
choked
with
ecstatic
laughing
sobs
her
hand
shook
so
that
she
could
scarcely
tear
open
the
envelope
she
tore
a
corner
of
the
letter
and
when
the
sheet
was
spread
open
her
eyes
were
full
of
wild
delighted
tears
which
made
it
impossible
for
her
to
see
for
the
moment
but
she
swept
the
tears
away
and
read
this
dear
daughter
it
seems
as
if
we
had
had
pretty
bad
luck
in
not
seeing
you
we
had
counted
on
it
very
much
and
your
mother
feels
it
all
the
more
because
she
is
weak
after
her
illness
we
do
quite
understand
why
you
did
not
seem
to
know
about
her
having
had
diphtheria
in
paris
you
did
not
answer
betty
letter
perhaps
it
missed
you
in
some
way
things
do
sometimes
go
wrong
in
the
mail
and
several
times
your
mother
has
thought
a
letter
has
been
lost
she
thought
so
because
you
seemed
to
forget
to
refer
to
things
we
came
over
to
leave
betty
at
a
french
school
and
we
had
expected
to
visit
you
later
but
your
mother
fell
ill
of
diphtheria
and
not
hearing
from
you
seemed
to
make
her
homesick
so
we
decided
to
return
to
new
york
by
the
next
steamer
i
ran
over
to
london
however
to
make
some
inquiries
about
you
and
on
the
first
day
i
arrived
i
met
your
husband
in
bond
street
he
at
once
explained
to
me
that
you
had
gone
to
a
house
party
at
some
castle
in
scotland
and
said
you
were
well
and
enjoying
yourself
very
much
and
he
was
on
his
way
to
join
you
i
am
sorry
daughter
that
it
has
turned
out
that
we
could
not
see
each
other
it
seems
a
long
time
since
you
left
us
but
i
am
very
glad
however
that
you
are
so
well
and
really
like
english
life
if
we
had
time
for
it
i
am
sure
it
would
be
delightful
your
mother
sends
her
love
and
wants
very
much
to
hear
of
all
you
are
doing
and
enjoying
hoping
that
we
may
have
better
luck
the
next
time
we
cross
your
affectionate
father
reuben
vanderpoel
rosalie
found
herself
running
breathlessly
up
the
avenue
she
was
clutching
the
letter
still
in
her
hand
and
staggering
from
side
to
side
now
and
then
she
uttered
horrible
little
short
cries
like
an
animal
she
ran
and
ran
seeing
nothing
and
now
and
then
with
the
clenched
hand
in
which
the
letter
was
crushed
striking
a
sharp
blow
at
her
breast
she
stumbled
up
the
big
stone
steps
she
had
mounted
on
the
day
she
was
brought
home
as
a
bride
her
dress
caught
her
feet
and
she
fell
on
her
knees
and
scrambled
up
again
gasping
she
dashed
across
the
huge
dark
hall
and
hurling
herself
against
the
door
of
the
morning
room
appeared
dishevelled
and
with
scarlet
patches
on
her
wild
white
face
before
the
dowager
who
started
angrily
to
her
feet
where
is
nigel
where
is
nigel
she
cried
out
frenziedly
what
in
heaven
name
do
you
mean
by
such
manners
demanded
her
ladyship
apologise
at
once
where
is
nigel
nigel
nigel
the
girl
raved
i
will
see
him
i
will
i
will
see
him
she
who
had
been
the
mildest
of
creatures
all
her
life
had
suddenly
gone
almost
insane
with
heartbroken
hysteric
grief
and
rage
she
did
not
know
what
she
was
saying
and
doing
she
only
realised
in
an
agony
of
despair
that
she
was
a
thing
caught
in
a
trap
that
these
people
had
her
in
their
power
and
that
they
had
tricked
and
lied
to
her
and
kept
her
apart
from
what
her
girl
heart
so
cried
out
to
and
longed
for
her
father
her
mother
her
little
sister
they
had
been
near
her
and
had
been
lied
to
and
sent
away
you
are
quite
mad
you
violent
uncontrolled
creature
cried
the
dowager
furiously
you
ought
to
be
put
in
a
straitjacket
and
drenched
with
cold
then
the
door
opened
again
and
nigel
strode
in
he
was
in
riding
dress
and
was
breathless
and
livid
with
anger
he
was
in
a
nice
mood
to
confront
a
wife
on
the
verge
of
screaming
hysterics
after
a
bad
half
hour
with
his
steward
who
had
been
talking
of
impending
disasters
he
had
heard
by
chance
of
wilson
conflagration
and
the
cheque
he
had
galloped
home
at
the
top
of
his
horse
speed
here
is
your
wife
raving
mad
cried
out
his
mother
rosalie
staggered
across
the
room
to
him
she
held
up
her
hand
clenching
the
letter
and
shook
it
at
him
my
mother
and
father
have
been
here
she
shrieked
my
mother
has
been
ill
they
wanted
to
come
to
see
me
you
knew
and
you
kept
it
from
me
you
told
my
father
lies
lies
hideous
lies
you
said
i
was
away
in
scotland
enjoying
myself
when
i
was
here
and
dying
with
homesickness
you
made
them
think
i
did
not
care
for
them
or
for
new
york
you
have
killed
me
why
did
you
do
such
a
wicked
thing
he
looked
at
her
with
glaring
eyes
if
a
man
born
a
gentleman
is
ever
in
the
mood
to
kick
his
wife
to
death
as
costermongers
do
he
was
in
that
mood
he
had
lost
control
over
himself
as
completely
as
she
had
and
while
she
was
only
a
desperate
hysteric
girl
he
was
a
violent
man
i
did
it
because
i
did
not
mean
to
have
them
here
he
said
i
did
it
because
i
wo
have
them
they
shall
come
she
quavered
shrilly
in
her
wildness
they
shall
come
to
see
me
they
are
my
own
father
and
mother
and
i
will
have
he
caught
her
arm
in
such
a
grip
that
she
must
have
thought
he
would
break
it
if
she
could
have
thought
or
felt
anything
no
you
will
not
have
them
he
ground
forth
between
his
teeth
you
will
do
as
i
order
you
and
learn
to
behave
yourself
as
a
decent
married
woman
should
you
will
learn
to
obey
your
husband
and
respect
his
wishes
and
control
your
devilish
american
they
have
gone
gone
wailed
rosalie
you
sent
them
away
my
father
my
mother
my
sister
stop
your
indecent
ravings
ordered
sir
nigel
shaking
her
i
will
not
submit
to
be
disgraced
before
the
put
your
hand
over
her
mouth
nigel
cried
his
mother
the
very
scullery
maids
will
she
was
as
infuriated
as
her
son
and
indeed
to
behold
civilised
human
beings
in
the
state
of
uncontrolled
violence
these
three
had
reached
was
a
sight
to
shudder
at
i
wo
stop
cried
the
girl
why
did
you
take
me
away
from
everything
i
was
quite
happy
everybody
was
kind
to
me
i
loved
people
i
had
everything
no
one
ever
ever
ever
anyone
sir
nigel
clutched
her
arm
more
brutally
still
and
shook
her
with
absolute
violence
her
hair
broke
loose
and
fell
about
her
awful
little
distorted
sobbing
face
i
did
not
take
you
to
give
you
an
opportunity
to
display
your
vulgar
ostentation
by
throwing
away
cheques
to
villagers
he
said
i
did
take
you
to
give
you
the
position
of
a
lady
and
be
made
a
fool
of
by
you
have
ruined
him
burst
forth
his
mother
you
have
put
it
out
of
his
power
to
marry
an
englishwoman
who
would
have
known
it
was
her
duty
to
give
something
in
return
for
his
name
and
her
ladyship
had
begun
to
rave
also
and
as
mother
and
son
were
of
equal
violence
when
they
had
ceased
to
control
themselves
rosalie
began
to
find
herself
enlightened
unsparingly
she
and
her
people
were
vulgar
sharpers
they
had
trapped
a
gentleman
into
a
low
american
marriage
and
had
not
the
decency
to
pay
for
what
they
had
got
if
she
had
been
an
englishwoman
well
born
and
of
decent
breeding
all
her
fortune
would
have
been
properly
transferred
to
her
husband
and
he
would
have
had
the
dispensing
of
it
her
husband
would
have
been
in
the
position
to
control
her
expenditure
and
see
that
she
did
not
make
a
fool
of
herself
as
it
was
she
was
the
derision
of
all
decent
people
of
all
people
who
had
been
properly
brought
up
and
knew
what
was
in
good
taste
and
of
good
morality
first
it
was
the
dowager
who
poured
forth
and
then
it
was
sir
nigel
they
broke
in
on
each
other
they
interrupted
one
another
with
exclamations
and
interpolations
they
had
so
far
lost
themselves
that
they
did
not
know
they
became
grotesque
in
the
violence
of
their
fury
rosalie
brain
whirled
her
hysteria
mounted
and
mounted
she
stared
first
at
one
and
then
at
the
other
gasping
and
sobbing
by
turns
she
swayed
on
her
feet
and
clutched
at
a
chair
i
did
not
know
she
broke
forth
at
last
trying
to
make
her
voice
heard
in
the
storm
i
never
understood
i
knew
something
made
you
hate
me
but
i
did
know
you
were
angry
about
she
laughed
tremulously
and
wildly
i
would
have
given
it
to
you
father
would
have
given
you
some
if
you
had
been
good
to
the
laugh
became
hysterical
beyond
her
management
peal
after
peal
broke
from
her
she
shook
all
over
with
her
ghastly
merriment
sobbing
at
one
and
the
same
time
oh
oh
oh
she
shrieked
you
see
i
thought
you
were
so
aristocratic
i
would
have
dared
to
think
of
such
a
thing
i
thought
an
english
gentleman
an
english
gentleman
oh
oh
to
think
it
was
all
because
i
did
not
give
you
money
just
common
dollars
and
cents
that
that
i
dare
offer
to
a
decent
american
who
could
work
for
sir
nigel
sprang
at
her
he
struck
her
with
his
open
hand
upon
the
cheek
and
as
she
reeled
she
held
up
her
small
feverish
shaking
hand
laughing
more
wildly
than
before
you
ought
not
to
strike
me
she
cried
you
ought
you
do
know
how
valuable
i
am
perhaps
with
a
little
crazy
scream
perhaps
i
might
have
a
she
fell
in
a
shuddering
heap
and
as
she
dropped
she
struck
heavily
against
the
protruding
end
of
an
oak
chest
and
lay
upon
the
floor
her
arms
flung
out
and
limp
as
if
she
were
a
dead
thing

least
in
the
sense
of
having
been
the
birthplaces
of
fathers
or
grandfathers
some
subtle
power
of
nature
caused
a
stirring
of
the
blood
a
vague
unexpressed
yearning
and
lingering
over
pages
which
depicted
sweet
green
lanes
broad
acres
rich
with
centuries
of
nourishment
and
care
grey
church
towers
red
roofs
and
village
children
playing
before
cottage
doors
none
of
these
things
were
new
to
those
who
pondered
over
them
kinsmen
had
dwelt
on
memories
of
them
in
their
fireside
talk
and
their
children
had
seen
them
in
fancy
and
in
dreams
old
grievances
having
had
time
to
fade
away
and
take
on
less
poignant
colour
the
stirring
of
the
blood
stirred
also
imaginations
and
wakened
something
akin
to
homesickness
though
no
man
called
the
feeling
by
its
name
and
this
perhaps
was
the
strongest
cord
the
shuttle
wove
and
was
the
true
meaning
of
its
power
being
drawn
by
it
americans
in
increasing
numbers
turned
their
faces
towards
the
older
land
gradually
it
was
discovered
that
it
was
the
simplest
affair
in
the
world
to
drive
down
to
the
wharves
and
take
a
steamer
which
landed
one
after
a
more
or
less
interesting
voyage
in
liverpool
or
at
some
other
convenient
port
from
there
one
went
to
london
or
paris
or
rome
in
fact
whithersoever
one
fancy
guided
but
first
or
last
it
always
led
the
traveller
to
the
treading
of
green
velvet
english
turf
and
once
standing
on
such
velvet
both
men
and
women
looking
about
them
felt
despite
themselves
the
strange
old
thrill
which
some
of
them
half
resented
and
some
warmly
loved
in
the
course
of
twelve
years
a
length
of
time
which
will
transform
a
little
girl
wearing
a
short
frock
into
a
young
woman
wearing
a
long
one
the
pace
of
life
and
the
ordering
of
society
may
become
so
altered
as
to
appear
amazing
when
one
finds
time
to
reflect
on
the
subject
but
one
does
not
often
find
time
changes
occur
so
gradually
that
one
scarcely
observes
them
or
so
swiftly
that
they
take
the
form
of
a
kind
of
amazed
shock
which
one
gets
over
as
quickly
as
one
experiences
it
and
realises
that
its
cause
is
already
a
fixed
fact
in
the
united
states
of
america
which
have
not
yet
acquired
the
serene
sense
of
conservative
and
repose
which
centuries
of
age
may
bestow
the
spirit
of
life
itself
is
the
aspiration
for
change
ambition
itself
only
means
the
insistence
on
change
each
day
is
to
be
better
than
yesterday
fuller
of
plans
of
briskness
of
initiative
each
demands
of
new
men
new
minds
new
work
a
which
has
not
launched
new
ships
explored
new
countries
constructed
new
buildings
added
stories
to
old
ones
may
consider
itself
a
failure
unworthy
even
of
being
consigned
to
the
limbo
of
respectable
yesterdays
such
a
country
lives
by
leaps
and
bounds
and
the
ten
years
which
followed
the
marriage
of
reuben
vanderpoel
eldest
daughter
made
many
such
bounds
and
leaps
they
were
years
which
initiated
and
established
international
social
relations
in
a
manner
which
caused
them
to
incorporate
themselves
with
the
history
of
both
countries
as
america
discovered
europe
that
continent
discovered
america
american
beauties
began
to
appear
in
english
and
continental
salons
they
were
presented
at
court
and
commented
upon
in
the
row
and
the
bois
their
little
transatlantic
tricks
of
speech
and
their
mots
were
repeated
with
gusto
it
became
understood
that
they
were
amusing
and
amazing
americans
came
in
as
the
heroes
and
heroines
of
novels
and
stories
punch
delighted
in
them
vastly
shopkeepers
and
hotel
proprietors
stocked
furnished
and
provisioned
for
them
they
spent
money
enormously
and
were
singularly
indifferent
at
the
outset
under
imposition
they
came
over
in
a
manner
as
though
less
than
that
of
william
the
conqueror
international
marriages
ceased
to
be
a
novelty
as
bettina
vanderpoel
grew
up
she
grew
up
so
to
speak
in
the
midst
of
them
she
saw
her
country
its
people
its
newspapers
its
literature
innocently
rejoiced
by
the
alliances
its
charming
young
women
contracted
with
foreign
rank
she
saw
it
affectionately
gleefully
rubbing
its
hands
over
its
duchesses
its
countesses
its
miladies
the
american
eagle
spread
its
wings
and
flapped
them
sometimes
a
trifle
over
this
new
but
so
natural
and
inevitable
triumph
of
its
virgins
it
was
of
course
only
american
that
such
things
should
happen
america
ruled
the
universe
and
its
women
ruled
america
bullying
it
a
little
prettily
perhaps
what
could
be
more
a
matter
of
course
than
that
american
women
being
aided
by
adoring
fathers
brothers
and
husbands
sumptuously
to
ship
themselves
to
other
lands
should
begin
to
rule
these
lands
also
betty
in
her
growing
up
heard
all
this
intimated
at
twelve
years
old
though
she
had
detested
rosalie
marriage
she
had
rather
liked
to
hear
people
talk
of
the
picturesqueness
of
places
like
stornham
court
and
of
the
life
led
by
women
of
rank
in
their
houses
in
town
and
country
such
talk
nearly
always
involved
the
description
of
things
and
people
whose
colour
and
tone
had
only
reached
her
through
the
medium
of
books
most
frequently
fiction
she
was
however
of
an
unusually
observing
mind
even
as
a
child
and
the
time
came
when
she
realised
that
the
national
bird
spread
its
wings
less
proudly
when
the
subject
of
international
matches
was
touched
upon
and
even
at
such
times
showed
signs
of
restlessness
now
and
then
things
had
not
turned
out
as
they
appeared
to
promise
two
or
three
seemingly
brilliant
unions
had
resulted
in
disaster
she
had
not
understood
all
the
details
the
newspapers
cheerfully
provided
but
it
was
clear
to
her
that
more
than
one
previously
envied
young
woman
had
had
practical
reasons
for
discovering
that
she
had
made
an
astonishingly
bad
bargain
this
being
the
case
she
used
frequently
to
ponder
over
the
case
of
rosy
rosy
who
had
been
swept
away
from
them
and
swallowed
up
as
it
seemed
by
that
other
and
older
world
she
was
in
certain
ways
a
silent
child
and
no
one
but
herself
knew
how
little
she
had
forgotten
rosy
how
often
she
pondered
over
her
how
sometimes
she
had
lain
awake
in
the
night
and
puzzled
out
lines
of
argument
concerning
her
and
things
which
might
be
true
the
one
grief
of
poor
vanderpoel
life
had
been
the
apparent
estrangement
of
her
eldest
child
after
her
first
six
months
in
england
lady
anstruthers
letters
had
become
fewer
and
farther
between
and
had
given
so
little
information
connected
with
herself
that
affectionate
curiosity
became
discouraged
sir
nigel
brief
and
rare
epistles
revealed
so
little
desire
for
any
relationship
with
his
wife
family
that
gradually
rosy
image
seemed
to
fade
into
far
distance
and
become
fainter
with
the
passing
of
each
month
it
seemed
almost
an
incredible
thing
when
they
allowed
themselves
to
think
of
it
but
no
member
of
the
family
had
ever
been
to
stornham
court
two
or
three
efforts
to
arrange
a
visit
had
been
made
but
on
each
occasion
had
failed
through
some
apparently
accidental
cause
once
lady
anstruthers
had
been
away
once
a
letter
had
seemingly
failed
to
reach
her
once
her
children
had
had
scarlet
fever
and
the
orders
of
the
physicians
in
attendance
had
been
stringent
in
regard
to
visitors
even
relatives
who
did
not
fear
contagion
if
she
had
been
living
in
new
york
and
her
children
had
been
ill
i
should
have
been
with
her
all
the
time
poor
vanderpoel
had
said
with
tears
rosy
changed
awfully
somehow
her
letters
do
sound
a
bit
like
she
used
to
be
it
seems
as
if
she
just
does
care
to
see
her
mother
and
betty
had
frowned
a
good
deal
and
thought
intensely
in
secret
she
did
not
believe
that
rosy
was
ashamed
of
her
relations
she
remembered
however
it
is
true
that
clara
newell
who
had
been
a
schoolmate
had
become
very
and
indifferent
to
her
family
after
her
marriage
to
an
aristocratic
and
learned
german
hers
had
been
one
of
the
successful
alliances
and
after
living
a
few
years
in
berlin
she
had
quite
looked
down
upon
new
yorkers
and
had
made
herself
exceedingly
unpopular
during
her
one
brief
visit
to
her
relatives
she
seemed
to
think
her
father
and
mother
undignified
and
uncultivated
and
she
disapproved
entirely
of
her
sisters
dress
and
bearing
she
said
that
they
had
no
distinction
of
manner
and
that
all
their
interests
were
frivolous
and
unenlightened
but
clara
always
was
a
conceited
girl
thought
betty
she
was
always
patronising
people
and
rosy
was
only
pretty
and
sweet
she
always
said
herself
that
she
had
no
brains
but
she
had
a
after
the
lapse
of
a
few
years
there
had
been
no
further
discussion
of
plans
for
visiting
stornham
rosalie
had
become
so
remote
as
to
appear
almost
unreachable
she
had
been
presented
at
court
she
had
had
three
children
the
dowager
lady
anstruthers
had
died
once
she
had
written
to
her
father
to
ask
for
a
large
sum
of
money
which
he
had
sent
to
her
because
she
seemed
to
want
it
very
much
she
required
it
to
pay
off
certain
debts
on
the
estate
and
spoke
touchingly
of
her
boy
who
would
inherit
he
is
a
delicate
boy
father
she
wrote
and
i
do
want
the
estate
to
come
to
him
when
she
received
the
money
she
wrote
gratefully
of
the
generosity
shown
her
but
she
spoke
very
vaguely
of
the
prospect
of
their
seeing
each
other
in
the
future
it
was
as
if
she
felt
her
own
remoteness
even
more
than
they
felt
it
themselves
in
the
meantime
bettina
had
been
taken
to
france
and
placed
at
school
there
the
resulting
experience
was
an
enlightening
one
far
more
illuminating
to
the
american
child
than
it
would
have
been
to
an
english
french
or
german
one
who
would
not
have
had
so
much
to
learn
and
probably
would
not
have
been
so
quick
at
the
learning
betty
vanderpoel
knew
nothing
which
was
not
american
and
only
vaguely
a
few
things
which
were
not
of
new
york
she
had
lived
in
fifth
avenue
attended
school
in
a
numbered
street
near
her
own
home
played
in
and
been
driven
round
central
park
she
had
spent
the
hot
months
of
the
summer
in
places
up
the
hudson
or
on
long
island
and
such
resorts
of
pleasure
she
had
believed
implicitly
in
all
she
saw
and
knew
she
had
been
surrounded
by
wealth
and
decent
good
nature
throughout
her
existence
and
had
enjoyed
her
life
far
too
much
to
admit
of
any
doubt
that
america
was
the
most
perfect
country
in
the
world
americans
the
cleverest
and
most
amusing
people
and
that
other
nations
were
a
little
out
of
it
and
consequently
sufficiently
scant
of
resource
to
render
pity
without
condemnation
a
natural
sentiment
in
connection
with
occasional
thoughts
of
them
but
hers
was
a
mentality
by
no
means
ordinary
inheritance
in
her
nature
had
combined
with
circumstances
as
it
has
a
habit
of
doing
in
all
human
beings
but
in
her
case
the
combinations
were
unusual
and
produced
a
result
somewhat
remarkable
the
quality
of
brains
which
in
the
first
reuben
vanderpoel
had
expressed
itself
in
the
marvellously
successful
planning
and
carrying
to
their
ends
of
commercial
and
financial
schemes
the
absolute
genius
of
penetration
and
calculation
of
the
sordid
and
uneducated
little
trader
in
skins
and
barterer
of
goods
having
filtered
through
two
generations
of
gradual
education
and
refinement
of
existence
which
was
no
longer
that
of
the
mere
trader
had
been
transformed
in
the
into
keen
clear
sight
perceptiveness
and
a
logical
sense
of
values
as
the
first
reuben
had
known
by
instinct
the
values
of
pelts
and
lands
bettina
knew
by
instinct
the
values
of
qualities
of
brains
of
hearts
of
circumstances
and
the
incidents
which
affect
them
she
was
as
unaware
of
the
significance
of
her
great
possession
as
were
those
around
her
nevertheless
it
was
an
unerring
thing
as
a
mere
child
unformed
and
uneducated
by
life
she
had
not
been
one
of
the
small
creatures
to
be
deceived
or
flattered
she
an
awfully
smart
little
thing
that
betty
her
new
york
aunts
and
cousins
often
remarked
she
seems
to
see
what
people
mean
it
does
matter
what
they
say
she
likes
people
you
would
not
expect
her
to
like
and
then
again
she
sometimes
does
care
the
least
for
people
who
are
thought
awfully
as
has
been
already
intimated
the
child
was
crude
enough
and
not
particularly
well
bred
but
her
small
brain
had
always
been
at
work
and
each
day
of
her
life
recorded
for
her
valuable
impressions
the
page
of
her
young
mind
had
ceased
to
be
a
blank
much
earlier
than
is
usual
the
comparing
of
these
impressions
with
such
as
she
received
when
her
life
in
the
french
school
was
new
afforded
her
active
mental
exercise
she
began
with
natural
secret
indignation
and
rebellion
there
was
no
other
american
pupil
in
the
establishment
besides
herself
but
for
the
fact
that
the
name
of
vanderpoel
represented
wealth
so
enormous
as
to
amount
to
a
sort
of
rank
in
itself
bettina
would
not
have
been
received
the
proprietress
of
the
institution
had
gravely
disquieting
doubts
of
the
propriety
of
america
her
pupils
were
not
accustomed
to
freedom
of
opinions
and
customs
an
american
child
might
either
consciously
or
unconsciously
introduce
them
as
this
must
be
guarded
against
betty
first
few
months
at
the
school
were
not
agreeable
to
her
she
was
supervised
and
expurgated
as
it
were
special
sisters
were
told
off
to
converse
and
walk
with
her
and
she
soon
perceived
that
conversations
were
not
only
french
lessons
in
disguise
but
were
lectures
on
ethics
morals
and
good
manners
imperfectly
concealed
by
the
mask
and
domino
of
amiable
entertainment
she
translated
into
english
after
the
following
manner
the
facts
her
swift
young
perceptions
gathered
there
were
things
it
was
so
inelegant
to
say
that
only
the
most
impossible
persons
said
them
there
were
things
it
was
so
inexcusable
to
do
that
when
done
their
inexcusability
assumed
the
proportions
of
a
crime
there
were
movements
expressions
points
of
view
which
one
must
avoid
as
one
would
avoid
the
plague
and
they
were
all
things
acts
expressions
attitudes
of
mind
which
bettina
had
been
familiar
with
from
her
infancy
and
which
she
was
well
aware
were
considered
almost
entirely
harmless
and
unobjectionable
in
new
york
in
her
beloved
new
york
which
was
the
centre
of
the
world
which
was
bigger
richer
gayer
more
admirable
than
any
other
city
known
upon
the
earth
if
she
had
not
so
loved
it
if
she
had
ever
dreamed
of
the
existence
of
any
other
place
as
being
absolutely
necessary
she
would
not
have
felt
the
thing
so
bitterly
but
it
seemed
to
her
that
all
these
amiable
diatribes
in
exquisite
french
were
directed
at
her
new
york
and
it
must
be
admitted
that
she
was
humiliated
and
enraged
it
was
a
personal
indeed
a
family
matter
her
father
her
mother
her
relatives
and
friends
were
all
in
some
degree
exactly
the
kind
of
persons
whose
speech
habits
and
opinions
she
must
conscientiously
avoid
but
for
the
instinct
of
summing
up
values
circumstances
and
intentions
it
is
probable
that
she
would
have
lost
her
head
let
loose
her
temper
and
her
tongue
and
have
become
insubordinate
but
the
quickness
of
perception
which
had
revealed
practical
potentialities
to
old
reuben
vanderpoel
revealed
to
her
the
value
of
french
which
was
perfectly
fluent
a
voice
which
was
musical
movements
which
were
grace
manners
which
had
a
still
beauty
and
comparing
these
things
with
others
less
charming
she
listened
and
restrained
herself
learning
marking
and
inwardly
digesting
with
a
cleverness
most
enviable
among
her
fellow
pensionnaires
she
met
with
discomforting
illuminations
which
were
fine
discipline
also
though
if
she
herself
had
been
a
less
intellectual
creature
they
might
have
been
embittering
without
doubt
betty
even
at
twelve
years
was
intellectual
hers
was
the
practical
working
intellect
which
begins
duty
at
birth
and
does
not
lay
down
its
tools
because
the
sun
sets
the
little
and
big
girls
who
wrote
their
exercises
at
her
side
did
not
deliberately
enlighten
her
but
she
learned
from
them
in
vague
ways
that
it
was
not
new
york
which
was
the
centre
of
the
earth
but
paris
or
berlin
madrid
london
or
rome
paris
and
london
were
perhaps
more
calmly
positive
of
themselves
than
other
capitals
and
were
a
little
inclined
to
smile
at
the
lack
of
seriousness
in
other
claims
but
one
strange
fact
was
more
predominant
than
any
other
and
this
was
that
new
york
was
not
counted
as
a
civilised
centre
at
all
it
had
no
particular
existence
nobody
expressed
this
rudely
in
fact
it
did
not
acquire
the
form
of
actual
statement
at
any
time
it
was
merely
revealed
by
amiable
and
ingenuous
unconsciousness
of
the
circumstance
that
such
a
part
of
the
world
expected
to
be
regarded
or
referred
to
at
all
betty
began
early
to
realise
that
as
her
companions
did
not
talk
of
timbuctoo
or
zanzibar
so
they
did
not
talk
of
new
york
stockholm
or
amsterdam
seemed
despite
their
smallness
to
be
considered
no
one
denied
the
presence
of
zanzibar
on
the
map
but
as
it
conveyed
nothing
more
than
the
impression
of
being
a
mere
geographical
fact
there
was
no
reason
why
one
should
dwell
on
it
in
conversation
remembering
all
she
had
left
behind
the
crowded
streets
the
brilliant
shop
windows
the
buzz
of
individual
people
there
were
moments
when
betty
ground
her
strong
little
teeth
she
wanted
to
express
all
these
things
to
call
out
to
explain
and
command
recognition
for
them
but
her
cleverness
showed
to
her
that
argument
or
protestation
would
be
useless
she
could
not
make
such
hearers
understand
there
were
girls
whose
interest
in
america
was
founded
on
their
impression
that
magnificent
indian
chieftains
in
blankets
and
feathers
stalked
about
the
streets
of
the
towns
and
that
betty
own
thick
black
hair
had
been
handed
down
to
her
by
some
beautiful
minnehaha
or
pocahontas
when
first
she
was
approached
by
timid
tentative
questionings
revealing
this
point
of
view
betty
felt
hot
and
answered
with
unamiable
curtness
no
there
were
no
red
indians
in
new
york
there
had
been
no
red
indians
in
her
family
she
had
neither
grandmothers
nor
aunts
who
were
squaws
if
they
meant
that
she
felt
so
scornfully
so
disgustedly
indignant
at
their
benighted
ignorance
that
she
knew
she
behaved
very
well
in
saying
so
little
in
reply
she
could
have
said
so
much
but
whatsoever
she
had
said
would
have
conveyed
nothing
to
them
so
she
thought
it
all
out
alone
she
went
over
the
whole
ground
and
little
realised
how
much
she
was
teaching
herself
as
she
turned
and
tossed
in
her
narrow
spotlessly
white
bed
at
night
arguing
comparing
drawing
deductions
from
what
she
knew
and
did
not
know
of
the
two
continents
her
childish
anger
combining
itself
with
the
practical
alert
brain
of
reuben
vanderpoel
the
first
developed
in
her
a
logical
reasoning
power
which
led
her
to
arrive
at
many
an
excellent
and
curiously
mature
conclusion
the
result
was
finely
educational
all
the
more
so
that
in
her
fevered
desire
for
justification
of
the
things
she
loved
she
began
to
read
books
such
as
little
girls
do
not
usually
take
interest
in
she
found
some
difficulty
in
obtaining
them
at
first
but
a
letter
or
two
written
to
her
father
obtained
for
her
permission
to
read
what
she
chose
the
third
reuben
vanderpoel
was
deeply
fond
of
his
younger
daughter
and
felt
in
secret
a
profound
admiration
for
her
which
was
saved
from
becoming
too
obvious
by
the
ever
present
american
sense
of
humour
betty
seems
to
be
going
in
for
politics
he
said
after
reading
the
letter
containing
her
request
and
her
first
list
of
books
she
about
as
mad
as
she
can
be
at
the
ignorance
of
the
french
girls
about
america
and
americans
she
wants
to
fill
up
on
solid
facts
so
that
she
can
come
out
strong
in
argument
she
got
an
understanding
of
the
power
of
solid
facts
that
would
be
a
fortune
to
her
if
she
were
a
it
was
no
doubt
her
understanding
of
the
power
of
facts
which
led
her
to
learn
everything
well
and
to
develop
in
many
directions
she
began
to
dip
into
political
and
historical
volumes
because
she
was
furious
and
wished
to
be
able
to
refute
idiocy
but
she
found
herself
continuing
to
read
because
she
was
interested
in
a
way
she
had
not
expected
she
began
to
see
things
once
she
made
a
remark
which
was
prophetic
she
made
it
in
answer
to
a
guileless
observation
concerning
the
gold
mines
with
which
boston
was
supposed
to
be
enriched
you
do
know
anything
about
america
you
others
she
said
but
you
will
know
do
you
think
it
will
become
the
fashion
to
travel
in
america
asked
a
german
girl
perhaps
said
betty
but
it
is
so
much
that
you
will
go
to
america
i
believe
it
will
come
to
you
it
like
that
america
it
does
stand
still
it
goes
and
gets
what
it
she
laughed
as
she
ended
and
so
did
the
other
girls
but
in
ten
time
when
they
were
young
women
some
of
them
married
some
of
them
court
beauties
one
of
them
recalled
this
speech
to
another
whom
she
encountered
in
an
important
house
in
petersburg
the
wife
of
the
celebrated
diplomat
who
was
its
owner
being
an
american
woman
bettina
vanderpoel
education
was
a
rather
fine
thing
she
herself
had
more
to
do
with
it
than
girls
usually
have
to
do
with
their
own
training
in
a
few
months
time
those
in
authority
in
the
french
school
found
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
supervise
and
expurgate
her
she
learned
with
an
interested
rapacity
which
was
at
once
unusual
and
amazing
and
she
evidently
did
not
learn
from
books
alone
her
voice
as
an
organ
had
been
musical
and
full
from
babyhood
it
began
to
modulate
itself
and
to
express
things
most
voices
are
incapable
of
expressing
she
had
been
so
built
by
nature
that
the
carriage
of
her
head
and
limbs
was
good
to
behold
she
acquired
a
harmony
of
movement
which
caused
her
to
lose
no
shade
of
grace
and
spirit
her
eyes
were
full
of
thought
of
speculation
and
intentness
she
thinks
a
great
deal
for
one
so
young
was
said
of
her
frequently
by
one
or
the
other
of
her
teachers
one
finally
went
further
and
added
she
has
this
was
true
she
had
genius
but
it
was
not
specialised
it
was
not
genius
which
expressed
itself
through
any
one
art
it
was
a
genius
for
life
for
living
herself
for
aiding
others
to
live
for
vivifying
mere
existence
she
herself
was
however
aware
only
of
an
eagerness
of
temperament
a
passion
for
seeing
doing
and
gaining
knowledge
everything
interested
her
everybody
was
suggestive
and
more
or
less
enlightening
her
relatives
thought
her
original
in
her
fancies
they
called
them
fancies
because
she
was
so
young
fortunately
for
her
there
was
no
reason
why
she
should
not
be
gratified
most
girls
preferred
to
spend
their
holidays
on
the
continent
she
elected
to
return
to
america
every
alternate
year
she
enjoyed
the
voyage
and
she
liked
the
entire
change
of
atmosphere
and
people
it
makes
me
like
both
places
more
she
said
to
her
father
when
she
was
thirteen
it
makes
me
see
her
father
discovered
that
she
saw
everything
she
was
the
pleasure
of
his
life
he
was
attracted
greatly
by
the
interest
she
exhibited
in
all
orders
of
things
he
saw
her
make
bold
ingenuous
plunges
into
all
waters
without
any
apparent
consciousness
that
the
scraps
of
knowledge
she
brought
to
the
surface
were
unusual
possessions
for
a
schoolgirl
she
had
young
views
on
the
politics
and
commerce
of
different
countries
as
she
had
views
on
their
literature
when
reuben
vanderpoel
swooped
across
the
american
continent
on
journeys
of
thousands
of
miles
taking
her
as
a
companion
he
discovered
that
he
actually
placed
a
sort
of
confidence
in
her
summing
up
of
men
and
schemes
he
took
her
to
see
mines
and
railroads
and
those
who
worked
them
and
he
talked
them
over
with
her
afterward
half
with
a
sense
of
humour
half
with
a
sense
of
finding
comfort
in
her
intelligent
comprehension
of
all
he
said
she
enjoyed
herself
immensely
and
gained
a
strong
picturesqueness
of
character
after
an
american
holiday
she
used
to
return
to
france
germany
or
italy
with
a
renewed
zest
of
feeling
for
all
things
romantic
and
antique
after
a
few
years
in
the
french
convent
she
asked
that
she
might
be
sent
to
germany
i
am
gradually
changing
into
a
french
girl
she
wrote
to
her
father
one
morning
i
found
i
was
thinking
it
would
be
nice
to
go
into
a
convent
and
another
day
i
almost
entirely
agreed
with
one
of
the
girls
who
was
declaiming
against
her
brother
who
had
fallen
in
love
with
a
californian
you
had
better
take
me
away
and
send
me
to
reuben
vanderpoel
laughed
he
understood
betty
much
better
than
most
of
her
relations
did
he
knew
when
seriousness
underlay
her
jests
and
his
respect
for
her
seriousness
was
great
he
sent
her
to
school
in
germany
during
the
early
years
of
her
schooldays
betty
had
observed
that
america
appeared
upon
the
whole
to
be
regarded
by
her
schoolfellows
principally
as
a
place
to
which
the
more
unfortunate
among
the
peasantry
emigrated
as
steerage
passengers
when
things
could
become
no
worse
for
them
in
their
own
country
the
united
states
was
not
mentally
detached
from
any
other
portion
of
the
huge
western
continent
quite
persons
spoke
casually
of
individuals
having
gone
to
america
as
if
there
were
no
particular
difference
between
brazil
and
massachusetts
i
wonder
if
you
ever
saw
my
cousin
gaston
a
french
girl
once
asked
her
as
they
sat
at
their
desks
he
became
very
poor
through
ill
living
he
was
quite
without
money
and
he
went
to
to
new
york
inquired
bettina
i
am
not
sure
the
town
is
called
that
is
not
in
the
united
states
betty
answered
disdainfully
it
is
in
she
dragged
her
atlas
towards
her
and
found
the
place
see
she
said
it
is
thousands
of
miles
from
new
her
companion
was
a
rather
slow
girl
she
peered
at
the
map
drawing
a
line
with
her
finger
from
new
york
to
concepcion
yes
they
are
at
a
great
distance
from
one
another
she
admitted
but
they
are
both
in
but
not
both
in
the
united
states
cried
betty
french
girls
always
seem
to
think
that
north
and
south
america
are
the
same
that
they
are
both
the
united
yes
said
the
slow
girl
with
deliberation
we
do
make
odd
mistakes
to
which
she
added
with
entire
innocence
of
any
ironic
intention
but
you
americans
you
seem
to
feel
the
united
states
your
new
york
to
be
all
betty
started
a
little
and
flushed
during
a
few
minutes
of
rapid
reflection
she
sat
bolt
upright
at
her
desk
and
looked
straight
before
her
her
mentality
was
of
the
order
which
is
capable
of
making
discoveries
concerning
itself
as
well
as
concerning
others
she
had
never
thought
of
this
view
of
the
matter
before
but
it
was
quite
true
to
passionate
young
patriots
such
as
herself
at
least
that
portion
of
the
map
covered
by
the
united
states
was
america
she
suddenly
saw
also
that
to
her
new
york
had
been
america
fifth
avenue
broadway
central
park
even
tiffany
had
been
she
laughed
and
reddened
a
shade
as
she
put
the
atlas
aside
having
recorded
a
new
idea
she
had
found
out
that
it
was
not
only
europeans
who
were
local
which
was
a
discovery
of
some
importance
to
her
fervid
youth
because
she
thought
so
often
of
rosalie
her
attention
was
during
the
passing
years
naturally
attracted
by
the
many
things
she
heard
of
such
marriages
as
were
made
by
americans
with
men
of
other
countries
than
their
own
she
discovered
that
notwithstanding
certain
commercial
views
of
matrimony
all
foreigners
who
united
themselves
with
american
heiresses
were
not
the
entire
brutes
primitive
prejudice
might
lead
one
to
imagine
there
were
rather
alliances
which
proved
themselves
far
from
happy
the
cousin
gaston
for
instance
brought
home
a
bride
whose
fortune
rebuilt
and
refurnished
his
dilapidated
chateau
and
who
ended
by
making
of
him
a
and
cheery
country
gentleman
not
at
all
to
be
despised
in
his
amiable
if
good
nature
and
good
spirits
his
wife
fortunately
was
not
a
young
woman
who
yearned
for
sentiment
she
was
a
practical
american
girl
who
adored
french
country
life
and
knew
how
to
amuse
and
manage
her
husband
it
was
a
genial
sort
of
menage
and
yet
though
this
was
an
undeniable
fact
bettina
observed
that
when
the
union
was
spoken
of
it
was
always
referred
to
with
a
certain
tone
which
conveyed
that
though
one
did
not
exactly
complain
of
its
having
been
undesirable
it
was
not
quite
what
gaston
might
have
expected
his
wife
had
money
and
was
but
there
were
limitations
to
one
appreciation
of
a
marriage
in
which
husband
and
wife
were
not
on
the
same
plane
she
is
an
excellent
person
and
it
has
been
good
for
gaston
said
bettina
friend
we
like
her
but
she
is
not
she
is
not
she
paused
there
evidently
seeing
that
the
remark
was
unlucky
bettina
who
was
still
in
short
frocks
took
her
up
what
is
she
not
she
asked
ah
it
is
difficult
to
explain
to
americans
it
is
really
not
exactly
a
fault
but
she
is
not
of
his
but
if
he
does
not
like
that
said
bettina
coolly
why
did
he
let
her
buy
him
and
pay
for
him
it
was
young
and
brutal
but
there
were
times
when
the
business
perspicuity
of
the
first
reuben
vanderpoel
combining
with
the
fiery
wounded
spirit
of
his
young
descendant
rendered
bettina
brutal
she
saw
certain
unadorned
facts
with
unsparing
young
eyes
and
wanted
to
state
them
after
her
frocks
were
lengthened
she
learned
how
to
state
them
with
more
fineness
of
phrase
but
even
then
she
was
sometimes
still
rather
unsparing
in
this
case
her
companion
who
was
not
fiery
of
temperament
only
coloured
slightly
it
was
not
quite
that
she
answered
gaston
really
is
fond
of
her
she
amuses
him
and
he
says
she
is
far
cleverer
than
he
but
there
were
unions
less
satisfactory
and
bettina
had
opportunities
to
reflect
upon
these
also
the
english
and
continental
papers
did
not
give
enthusiastic
detailed
descriptions
of
the
marriages
new
york
journals
dwelt
upon
with
such
delight
they
were
passed
over
with
a
paragraph
when
betty
heard
them
spoken
of
in
france
germany
or
italy
she
observed
that
they
were
not
as
a
rule
spoken
of
respectfully
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
bridegrooms
were
in
conversation
treated
by
their
equals
with
scant
respect
it
appeared
that
there
had
always
been
some
extremely
practical
reason
for
the
passion
which
had
led
them
to
the
altar
one
generally
gathered
that
they
or
their
estates
were
very
much
out
at
elbow
and
frequently
their
characters
were
not
considered
admirable
by
their
relatives
and
acquaintances
some
had
been
rather
cold
shouldered
in
certain
capitals
on
account
of
embarrassing
little
or
big
stories
some
had
spent
their
patrimonies
in
riotous
living
those
who
had
merely
begun
by
coming
into
impoverished
estates
and
had
later
attenuated
their
resources
by
comparatively
decent
follies
were
of
the
more
desirable
order
by
the
time
she
was
nineteen
bettina
had
felt
the
blood
surge
in
her
veins
more
than
once
when
she
heard
some
comments
on
alliances
over
which
she
had
seen
her
compatriots
glow
with
affectionate
delight
it
was
time
ludlow
married
some
girl
with
money
she
heard
said
of
one
such
union
he
had
been
playing
the
fool
ever
since
he
came
into
the
estate
horses
and
a
lot
of
stupid
women
he
had
come
some
awful
croppers
during
the
last
ten
years
looking
girl
they
tell
me
the
american
he
has
married
tremendous
lot
of
money
have
picked
it
up
on
this
side
english
young
women
of
fortune
are
not
looking
for
that
kind
of
thing
poor
old
billy
was
good
bettina
told
the
story
to
her
father
when
they
next
met
she
had
grown
into
a
tall
young
creature
by
this
time
her
low
full
voice
was
like
a
bell
and
was
capable
of
ringing
forth
some
fine
mellow
tones
of
irony
and
in
america
we
are
pleased
she
said
and
flatter
ourselves
that
we
are
receiving
the
proper
tribute
of
adoration
of
our
american
wit
and
beauty
we
plume
ourselves
on
our
no
betty
said
her
father
and
his
reflective
deliberation
had
meaning
there
are
a
lot
of
us
who
do
plume
ourselves
particularly
in
these
days
we
are
not
as
innocent
as
we
were
when
this
sort
of
thing
began
we
are
not
as
innocent
as
we
were
when
rosy
was
and
he
sighed
and
rubbed
his
forehead
with
the
handle
of
his
pen
not
as
innocent
as
we
were
when
rosy
was
married
he
repeated
bettina
went
to
him
and
slid
her
fine
young
arm
round
his
neck
it
was
a
long
slim
round
arm
with
a
wonderful
power
to
caress
in
its
curves
she
kissed
vanderpoel
lined
cheek
have
you
had
time
to
think
much
about
rosy
she
said
i
not
had
time
but
i
done
it
he
answered
anything
that
hurts
your
mother
hurts
me
sometimes
she
begins
to
cry
in
her
sleep
and
when
i
wake
her
she
tells
me
she
has
been
dreaming
that
she
has
seen
i
have
had
time
to
think
of
her
said
bettina
i
have
heard
so
much
of
these
things
i
was
at
school
in
germany
when
annie
butterfield
and
baron
von
steindahl
were
married
i
heard
it
talked
about
there
and
then
my
mother
sent
me
some
american
she
laughed
a
little
and
for
a
moment
her
laugh
did
not
sound
like
a
girl
well
it
turned
out
badly
enough
her
father
commented
the
papers
had
plenty
to
say
about
it
later
there
was
much
he
was
too
good
to
do
to
his
wife
there
was
nothing
too
bad
for
him
to
do
before
he
had
a
wife
said
bettina
he
was
black
it
was
an
insolence
that
he
should
have
dared
to
speak
to
annie
butterfield
somebody
ought
to
have
beaten
he
beat
her
yes
and
i
think
his
family
thought
it
quite
natural
they
said
that
she
was
so
vulgar
and
american
that
she
exasperated
frederick
beyond
endurance
she
was
not
geboren
that
was
she
laughed
her
severe
little
laugh
again
perhaps
we
shall
get
tired
in
time
she
added
i
think
we
are
learning
if
it
is
made
a
matter
of
business
quite
open
and
aboveboard
it
will
be
fair
you
know
father
you
always
said
that
i
was
there
was
interested
curiosity
in
vanderpoel
steady
look
at
her
there
were
times
when
he
felt
that
betty
summing
up
of
things
was
well
worth
listening
to
he
saw
that
now
she
was
in
one
of
her
moods
when
it
would
pay
one
to
hear
her
out
she
held
her
chin
up
a
little
and
her
face
took
on
a
fine
stillness
at
once
sweet
and
unrelenting
she
was
very
good
to
look
at
in
such
moments
yes
he
answered
you
have
a
particularly
level
head
for
a
well
she
went
on
what
i
see
is
that
these
things
are
not
business
and
they
ought
to
be
if
a
man
comes
to
a
rich
american
girl
and
says
and
my
title
are
for
sale
will
you
buy
us
if
the
girl
is
is
that
kind
of
a
girl
and
wants
that
kind
of
man
she
can
look
them
both
over
and
say
i
will
buy
you
and
it
can
be
arranged
he
will
not
return
the
money
if
he
is
unsatisfactory
but
she
can
not
complain
that
she
has
been
deceived
she
can
only
complain
of
that
when
he
pretends
that
he
asks
her
to
marry
him
because
he
wants
her
for
his
wife
because
he
would
want
her
for
his
wife
if
she
were
as
poor
as
himself
let
it
be
understood
that
he
is
property
for
sale
let
her
make
sure
that
he
is
the
kind
of
property
she
wants
to
buy
then
if
when
they
are
married
he
is
brutal
or
impudent
or
his
people
are
brutal
or
impudent
she
can
say
will
forfeit
the
purchase
money
but
i
will
not
forfeit
myself
i
will
not
stay
with
you
they
would
not
like
to
hear
you
say
that
betty
said
her
father
rubbing
his
chin
reflectively
no
she
answered
neither
the
girl
nor
the
man
would
like
it
and
it
is
their
business
not
mine
but
it
is
practical
and
would
prevent
silly
mistakes
it
would
prevent
the
girls
being
laughed
at
it
is
when
they
are
flattered
by
the
choice
made
of
them
that
they
are
laughed
at
no
one
can
sneer
at
a
man
or
woman
for
buying
what
they
think
they
want
and
throwing
it
aside
if
it
turns
out
a
bad
she
had
seated
herself
near
her
father
she
rested
her
elbow
slightly
on
the
table
and
her
chin
in
the
hollow
of
her
hand
she
was
a
beautiful
young
creature
she
had
a
soft
curving
mouth
and
a
soft
curving
cheek
which
was
warm
rose
taken
in
conjunction
with
those
young
charms
her
next
words
had
an
air
of
incongruity
you
think
i
am
hard
she
said
when
i
think
of
these
things
i
am
hard
as
hard
as
nails
that
is
an
americanism
but
it
is
a
good
expression
i
am
angry
for
america
if
we
are
sordid
and
undignified
let
us
get
what
we
pay
for
and
make
the
others
acknowledge
that
we
have
she
did
not
smile
nor
did
her
father
vanderpoel
on
the
contrary
sighed
he
had
a
dreary
suspicion
that
rosy
at
least
had
not
received
what
she
had
paid
for
and
he
knew
she
had
not
been
in
the
least
aware
that
she
had
paid
or
that
she
was
expected
to
do
so
several
times
during
the
last
few
years
he
had
thought
that
if
he
had
not
been
so
hard
worked
if
he
had
had
time
he
would
have
seriously
investigated
the
case
of
rosy
but
who
is
not
aware
that
the
profession
of
multimillionaire
does
not
allow
of
any
swerving
from
duty
or
of
any
interests
requiring
leisure
i
wonder
betty
he
said
quite
deliberately
if
you
know
how
handsome
you
are
yes
answered
bettina
i
think
so
and
i
am
tall
it
is
the
fashion
to
be
tall
now
it
was
early
victorian
to
be
little
the
queen
brought
in
the
little
woman
and
now
the
type
has
gone
they
will
come
to
look
at
you
pretty
soon
said
vanderpoel
what
shall
you
say
then
i
said
bettina
and
her
voice
sounded
particularly
low
and
mellow
i
have
a
little
monomania
father
some
people
have
a
monomania
for
one
thing
and
some
for
another
mine
is
for
not
taking
a
bargain
from
the
ducal
remnant
chapter
vi
an
unfair
endowment
to
bettina
vanderpoel
had
been
given
to
an
extraordinary
extent
the
extraordinary
thing
which
is
called
beauty
which
is
a
thing
entirely
set
apart
from
mere
good
looks
or
prettiness
this
thing
is
extraordinary
because
if
statistics
were
taken
the
result
would
probably
be
the
discovery
that
not
three
human
beings
in
a
million
really
possess
it
that
it
should
be
bestowed
at
all
since
it
is
so
rare
seems
as
unfair
a
thing
as
appears
to
the
mere
mortal
mind
the
bestowal
of
unbounded
wealth
since
it
quite
as
inevitably
places
the
life
of
its
owner
upon
an
abnormal
plane
there
are
millions
of
pretty
women
and
billions
of
personable
men
but
the
man
or
woman
of
entire
physical
beauty
may
cross
one
pathway
only
once
in
a
lifetime
or
not
at
all
in
the
latter
case
it
is
natural
to
doubt
the
absolute
truth
of
the
rumours
that
the
thing
exists
the
abnormal
creature
seems
a
mere
freak
of
nature
and
may
chance
to
be
angel
criminal
total
insipidity
virago
or
enchanter
but
let
such
an
one
enter
a
room
or
appear
in
the
street
and
heads
must
turn
eyes
light
and
follow
souls
yearn
or
envy
or
sink
under
the
discouragement
of
comparison
with
the
complete
harmony
and
perfect
balance
of
the
singular
thing
it
would
be
folly
for
the
rest
of
the
world
to
compete
a
human
being
who
had
lived
in
poverty
for
half
a
lifetime
might
if
suddenly
endowed
with
limitless
fortune
retain
to
a
certain
extent
balance
of
mind
but
the
same
creature
having
lived
the
same
number
of
years
a
wholly
unlovely
thing
suddenly
awakening
to
the
possession
of
entire
physical
beauty
might
find
the
strain
upon
pure
sanity
greater
and
the
balance
less
easy
to
preserve
the
relief
from
the
conscious
or
unconscious
tension
bred
by
the
sense
of
imperfection
the
calm
surety
of
the
fearlessness
of
meeting
in
any
eye
a
look
not
lighted
by
pleasure
would
be
less
normal
than
the
knowledge
that
no
wish
need
remain
unfulfilled
no
fancy
ungratified
even
at
sixteen
betty
was
a
young
nymph
whose
small
head
set
high
on
a
fine
slim
column
of
throat
might
well
have
been
crowned
with
the
garland
of
some
goddess
of
health
and
the
joy
of
life
she
was
light
and
swift
and
being
a
creature
of
long
lines
and
tender
curves
there
was
pleasure
in
the
mere
seeing
her
move
the
cut
of
her
spirited
lip
and
delicate
nostril
made
for
a
profile
at
which
one
turned
to
look
more
than
once
despite
one
self
her
hair
was
soft
and
black
and
repeated
its
colour
in
the
extravagant
lashes
of
her
childhood
which
made
mysterious
the
changeful
dense
blue
of
her
eyes
they
were
eyes
with
laughter
in
them
and
pride
and
a
suggestion
of
many
deep
things
yet
unstirred
she
was
rather
unusually
tall
and
her
body
had
the
suppleness
of
a
young
bamboo
the
deep
corners
of
her
red
mouth
curled
generously
and
the
chin
melting
into
the
fine
line
of
the
lovely
throat
was
at
once
strong
and
soft
and
lovely
she
was
a
creature
of
harmony
warm
richness
of
colour
and
brilliantly
alluring
life
when
her
school
days
were
over
she
returned
to
new
york
and
gave
herself
into
her
mother
hands
her
mother
kindness
of
heart
and
lovingness
were
touching
things
to
bettina
in
the
midst
of
her
millions
vanderpoel
was
wholly
unworldly
bettina
knew
that
she
felt
a
perpetual
homesickness
when
she
allowed
herself
to
think
of
the
daughter
who
seemed
lost
to
her
and
the
girl
realisation
of
this
caused
her
to
wish
to
be
especially
affectionate
and
amenable
she
was
glad
that
she
was
tall
and
beautiful
not
merely
because
such
physical
gifts
added
to
the
colour
and
agreeableness
of
life
but
because
hers
gave
comfort
and
happiness
to
her
mother
to
vanderpoel
to
introduce
to
the
world
the
loveliest
debutante
of
many
years
was
to
be
launched
into
a
new
future
to
concern
one
self
about
her
exquisite
wardrobe
was
to
have
an
enlivening
occupation
to
see
her
surrounded
to
watch
eyes
as
they
followed
her
to
hear
her
praised
was
to
feel
something
of
the
happiness
she
had
known
in
those
younger
days
when
new
york
had
been
less
advanced
in
its
news
and
methods
and
slim
little
blonde
rosalie
had
come
out
in
white
tulle
and
waltzed
like
a
fairy
with
a
hundred
partners
i
wonder
what
rosy
looks
like
now
the
poor
woman
said
involuntarily
one
day
bettina
was
not
a
fairy
when
her
mother
uttered
her
exclamation
bettina
was
on
the
point
of
going
out
and
as
she
stood
near
her
wrapped
in
splendid
furs
she
had
the
air
of
a
russian
princess
she
could
not
have
worn
the
things
you
do
betty
said
the
affectionate
maternal
creature
she
was
such
a
little
slight
thing
but
she
was
very
pretty
i
wonder
if
twelve
years
have
changed
her
much
betty
turned
towards
her
rather
suddenly
mother
she
said
sometime
before
very
long
i
am
going
to
to
see
exclaimed
vanderpoel
to
see
rosy
yes
betty
answered
i
have
a
plan
i
have
never
told
you
of
it
but
i
have
been
thinking
over
it
ever
since
i
was
fifteen
years
she
went
to
her
mother
and
kissed
her
she
wore
a
becoming
but
resolute
expression
we
will
not
talk
about
it
now
she
said
there
are
some
things
i
must
find
when
she
had
left
the
room
which
she
did
almost
immediately
vanderpoel
sat
down
and
cried
she
nearly
always
shed
a
few
tears
when
anyone
touched
upon
the
subject
of
rosy
on
her
desk
were
some
photographs
one
was
of
rosy
as
a
little
girl
with
long
hair
one
was
of
lady
anstruthers
in
her
wedding
dress
and
one
was
of
sir
nigel
i
never
felt
as
if
i
quite
liked
him
she
said
looking
at
this
last
but
i
suppose
she
does
or
she
would
not
be
so
happy
that
she
could
forget
her
mother
and
there
was
another
picture
she
looked
at
rosalie
had
sent
it
with
the
letter
she
wrote
to
her
father
after
he
had
forwarded
the
money
she
asked
for
it
was
a
little
study
in
water
colours
of
the
head
of
her
boy
it
was
nothing
but
a
head
the
shoulders
being
fancifully
draped
but
the
face
was
a
peculiar
one
it
was
and
unlovely
but
for
a
mouth
at
once
pathetic
and
sweet
he
is
not
a
pretty
child
sighed
vanderpoel
i
should
have
thought
rosy
would
have
had
pretty
babies
ughtred
is
more
like
his
father
than
his
she
spoke
to
her
husband
later
of
what
betty
had
said
what
do
you
think
she
has
in
her
mind
reuben
she
asked
what
betty
has
in
her
mind
is
usually
good
sense
was
his
response
she
will
begin
to
talk
to
me
about
it
presently
i
shall
not
ask
questions
yet
she
is
probably
thinking
things
she
was
in
truth
thinking
things
over
as
she
had
been
doing
for
some
time
she
had
asked
questions
on
several
occasions
of
english
people
she
had
met
abroad
but
a
schoolgirl
can
not
ask
many
questions
and
though
she
had
once
met
someone
who
knew
sir
nigel
anstruthers
it
was
a
person
who
did
not
know
him
well
for
the
reason
that
she
had
not
desired
to
increase
her
slight
acquaintance
this
lady
was
the
aunt
of
one
of
bettina
fellow
pupils
and
she
was
not
aware
of
the
relationship
to
sir
nigel
what
betty
gathered
was
that
her
was
regarded
as
a
decidedly
bad
lot
that
since
his
marriage
to
some
american
girl
he
had
seemed
to
have
money
which
he
spent
in
riotous
living
and
that
the
wife
who
was
said
to
be
a
silly
creature
was
kept
in
the
country
either
because
her
husband
did
not
want
her
in
london
or
because
she
preferred
to
stay
at
stornham
about
the
wife
no
one
appeared
to
know
anything
in
fact
she
is
rather
a
fool
i
believe
and
sir
nigel
anstruthers
is
the
kind
of
man
a
simpleton
would
be
obliged
to
submit
to
bettina
had
heard
the
lady
say
her
own
reflections
upon
these
comments
had
led
her
through
various
paths
of
thought
she
could
recall
rosalie
girlhood
and
what
she
herself
as
an
unconsciously
observing
child
had
known
of
her
character
she
remembered
the
simple
impressionability
of
her
mind
she
had
been
the
most
amenable
little
creature
in
the
world
her
yielding
amiability
could
always
be
counted
upon
as
a
factor
by
the
calculating
to
weakness
she
could
be
beguiled
or
distressed
into
any
course
the
desires
of
others
dictated
an
or
person
could
alter
any
line
of
conduct
she
herself
wished
to
pursue
she
was
neither
clever
nor
betty
said
to
herself
a
man
like
sir
nigel
anstruthers
could
make
what
he
chose
of
her
i
wonder
what
he
has
done
to
her
of
one
thing
she
thought
she
was
sure
this
was
that
rosalie
aloofness
from
her
family
was
the
result
of
his
design
she
comprehended
in
her
maturer
years
the
dislike
of
her
childhood
she
remembered
a
certain
look
in
his
face
which
she
had
detested
she
had
not
known
then
that
it
was
the
look
of
a
rather
clever
brute
who
was
malignant
but
she
knew
now
he
used
to
hate
us
all
she
said
to
herself
he
did
not
mean
to
know
us
when
he
had
taken
rosalie
away
and
he
did
not
intend
that
she
should
know
she
had
heard
rumours
of
cases
somewhat
parallel
cases
in
which
lives
had
become
swamped
in
those
of
their
husbands
and
their
families
and
she
had
also
heard
unpleasant
details
of
the
means
employed
to
reach
the
desired
results
annie
butterfield
husband
had
forbidden
her
to
correspond
with
her
american
relatives
he
had
argued
that
such
correspondence
was
disturbing
to
her
mind
and
to
the
domestic
duties
which
should
be
every
decent
woman
religion
one
of
the
occasions
of
his
beating
her
had
been
in
consequence
of
his
finding
her
writing
to
her
mother
a
letter
blotted
with
tears
husbands
frequently
objected
to
their
wives
relatives
but
there
was
a
special
order
of
european
husband
who
opposed
violently
any
intimacy
with
american
relations
on
the
practical
ground
that
their
views
of
a
wife
position
with
regard
to
her
husband
were
of
a
revolutionary
nature
vanderpoel
had
in
her
possession
every
letter
rosalie
or
her
husband
had
ever
written
bettina
asked
to
be
allowed
to
read
them
and
one
morning
seated
herself
in
her
own
room
before
a
blazing
fire
with
the
collection
on
a
table
at
her
side
she
read
them
in
order
began
as
they
went
on
they
were
all
in
one
tone
formal
uninteresting
and
requiring
no
answers
there
was
not
a
suggestion
of
human
feeling
in
one
of
them
he
wrote
them
said
betty
so
that
we
could
not
say
that
he
had
never
rosalie
first
epistles
were
affectionate
but
timid
at
the
outset
she
was
evidently
trying
to
conceal
the
fact
that
she
was
homesick
gradually
she
became
briefer
and
more
constrained
in
one
she
said
pathetically
i
am
such
a
bad
letter
writer
i
always
feel
as
if
i
want
to
tear
up
what
i
have
written
because
i
never
say
half
that
is
in
my
vanderpoel
had
kissed
that
letter
many
a
time
she
was
sure
that
a
mark
on
the
paper
near
this
particular
sentence
was
where
a
tear
had
fallen
bettina
was
sure
of
this
too
and
sat
and
looked
at
the
fire
for
some
time
that
night
she
went
to
a
ball
and
when
she
returned
home
she
persuaded
her
mother
to
go
to
bed
i
want
to
have
a
talk
with
father
she
exclaimed
i
am
going
to
ask
him
she
went
to
the
great
man
private
room
where
he
sat
at
work
even
after
the
hours
when
less
seriously
engaged
people
come
home
from
balls
the
room
he
sat
in
was
one
of
the
apartments
newspapers
had
with
much
detail
described
it
was
luxuriously
comfortable
and
its
effect
was
sober
and
rich
and
fine
when
bettina
came
in
vanderpoel
looking
up
to
smile
at
her
in
welcome
was
struck
by
the
fact
that
as
a
background
to
an
entering
figure
of
tall
splendid
girlhood
in
a
ball
dress
it
was
admirable
throwing
up
all
its
whiteness
and
grace
and
sweep
of
line
he
was
always
glad
to
see
betty
the
rich
strength
of
the
life
radiating
from
her
the
reality
and
glow
of
her
were
good
for
him
and
had
the
power
of
detaching
him
from
work
of
which
he
was
tired
she
smiled
back
at
him
and
coming
forward
took
her
place
in
a
big
armchair
close
to
him
her
cloak
slipping
from
her
shoulders
with
a
soft
rustling
sound
which
seemed
to
convey
her
intention
to
stay
are
you
too
busy
to
be
interrupted
she
asked
her
mellow
voice
caressing
him
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
something
i
am
going
to
she
put
out
her
hand
and
laid
it
on
his
with
a
clinging
firmness
which
meant
strong
feeling
at
least
i
am
going
to
do
it
if
you
will
help
me
she
ended
what
is
it
betty
he
inquired
his
usual
interest
in
her
accentuated
by
her
manner
she
laid
her
other
hand
on
his
and
he
clasped
both
with
his
own
when
the
worthingtons
sail
for
england
next
month
she
explained
i
want
to
go
with
them
worthington
is
very
kind
and
will
be
good
enough
to
take
care
of
me
until
i
reach
vanderpoel
moved
slightly
in
his
chair
then
their
eyes
met
comprehendingly
he
saw
what
hers
held
from
there
you
are
going
to
stornham
court
he
exclaimed
to
see
rosy
she
answered
leaning
a
little
forward
to
see
her
you
believe
that
what
has
happened
has
not
been
her
fault
he
said
there
was
a
look
in
her
face
which
warmed
his
blood
i
have
always
been
sure
that
nigel
anstruthers
arranged
do
you
think
he
has
been
unkind
to
her
i
am
going
to
see
she
answered
betty
he
said
tell
me
all
about
he
knew
that
this
was
no
plan
and
he
knew
it
would
be
well
worth
while
to
hear
the
details
of
its
growth
it
was
so
interestingly
like
her
to
have
remained
silent
through
the
process
of
thinking
a
thing
out
evolving
her
final
idea
without
having
disturbed
him
by
bringing
to
him
any
chaotic
uncertainties
it
a
sort
of
confession
she
answered
father
i
have
been
thinking
about
it
for
years
i
said
nothing
because
for
so
long
i
knew
i
was
only
a
child
and
a
child
judgment
might
be
worth
so
little
but
through
all
those
years
i
was
learning
things
and
gathering
evidence
when
i
was
at
school
first
in
one
country
and
then
another
i
used
to
tell
myself
that
i
was
growing
up
and
preparing
myself
to
do
a
particular
thing
to
go
to
rescue
i
used
to
guess
you
thought
of
her
in
a
way
of
your
own
vanderpoel
said
but
i
did
not
guess
you
were
thinking
that
much
you
were
always
a
solid
loyal
little
thing
and
there
was
business
capacity
in
your
keeping
your
scheme
to
yourself
let
us
look
the
matter
in
the
face
suppose
she
does
not
need
rescuing
suppose
after
all
she
is
a
comfortable
fine
lady
and
adores
her
husband
what
then
if
i
should
find
that
to
be
true
i
will
behave
myself
very
well
as
if
we
had
expected
nothing
else
i
will
make
her
a
short
visit
and
come
away
lady
cecilia
orme
whom
i
knew
in
florence
has
asked
me
to
stay
with
her
in
london
i
will
go
to
her
she
is
a
charming
woman
but
i
must
first
see
rosy
see
vanderpoel
thought
the
matter
over
during
a
few
moments
of
silence
you
do
not
wish
your
mother
to
go
with
you
he
said
presently
i
believe
it
will
be
better
that
she
should
not
she
answered
if
there
are
difficulties
or
disappointments
she
would
be
too
yes
he
said
slowly
and
she
could
not
control
her
feelings
she
would
give
the
whole
thing
away
poor
he
had
been
looking
at
the
carpet
reflectively
and
now
he
looked
at
bettina
what
are
you
expecting
to
find
at
the
worst
he
asked
her
the
kind
of
thing
which
will
need
management
while
it
is
being
looked
into
i
do
not
know
what
i
am
expecting
to
find
was
her
reply
we
know
absolutely
nothing
but
that
rosy
was
fond
of
us
and
that
her
marriage
has
seemed
to
make
her
cease
to
care
she
was
not
like
that
she
was
not
like
that
was
she
father
no
she
was
he
exclaimed
the
memory
of
her
in
her
and
early
girlish
days
a
pretty
smiling
effusive
thing
given
to
lavish
caresses
and
affectionate
little
surprises
for
them
all
came
back
to
him
vividly
she
was
the
most
affectionate
girl
i
ever
knew
he
said
she
was
more
affectionate
than
you
betty
with
a
smile
bettina
smiled
in
return
and
bent
her
head
to
put
a
kiss
on
his
hand
a
warm
lovely
comprehending
kiss
if
she
had
been
different
i
should
not
have
thought
so
much
of
the
change
she
said
i
believe
that
people
are
always
more
or
less
like
themselves
as
long
as
they
live
what
has
seemed
to
happen
has
been
so
unlike
rosy
that
there
must
be
some
reason
for
you
think
that
she
has
been
prevented
from
seeing
us
i
think
it
so
possible
that
i
am
not
going
to
announce
my
visit
you
have
a
good
head
betty
her
father
said
if
sir
nigel
has
put
obstacles
in
our
way
before
he
will
do
it
again
i
shall
try
to
find
out
when
i
reach
london
if
rosalie
is
at
stornham
when
i
am
sure
she
is
there
i
shall
go
and
present
myself
if
sir
nigel
meets
me
at
the
park
gates
and
orders
his
gamekeepers
to
drive
me
off
the
premises
we
shall
at
least
know
that
he
has
some
reason
for
not
wishing
to
regard
the
usual
social
and
domestic
amenities
i
feel
rather
like
a
detective
it
entertains
me
and
excites
me
a
the
deep
blue
of
her
eyes
shone
under
the
shadow
of
the
extravagant
lashes
as
she
laughed
are
you
willing
that
i
should
go
father
she
said
next
yes
he
answered
i
am
willing
to
trust
you
betty
to
do
things
i
would
not
trust
other
girls
to
try
at
if
you
were
not
my
girl
at
all
if
you
were
a
man
on
wall
street
i
should
know
you
would
be
pretty
safe
to
come
out
a
little
more
than
even
in
any
venture
you
made
you
know
how
to
keep
bettina
picked
up
her
fallen
cloak
and
laid
it
over
her
arm
it
was
made
of
billowy
frills
of
malines
lace
such
as
only
vanderpoels
could
buy
she
looked
down
at
the
amazing
thing
and
touched
up
the
frills
with
her
fingers
as
she
whimsically
smiled
there
are
a
good
many
girls
who
can
be
trusted
to
do
things
in
these
days
she
said
women
have
found
out
so
much
perhaps
it
is
because
the
heroines
of
novels
have
informed
them
heroines
and
heroes
always
bring
in
the
new
fashions
in
character
i
believe
it
is
years
since
a
heroine
into
a
flood
of
tears
it
has
been
discovered
really
that
nothing
is
to
be
gained
by
it
whatsoever
i
find
at
stornham
court
i
shall
neither
weep
nor
be
helpless
there
is
the
atlantic
cable
you
know
perhaps
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
heroines
have
changed
when
they
could
not
escape
from
their
persecutors
except
in
a
stage
coach
and
could
not
send
telegrams
they
were
more
or
less
in
hands
it
is
different
now
thank
you
father
you
are
very
good
to
believe
in
chapter
vii
on
board
the
meridiana
a
large
transatlantic
steamer
lying
at
the
wharf
on
a
brilliant
sunny
morning
just
before
its
departure
is
an
interesting
and
suggestive
object
to
those
who
are
fond
of
following
suggestion
to
its
end
one
sometimes
wonders
if
it
is
possible
that
the
excitement
in
the
dock
atmosphere
could
ever
become
a
thing
to
which
one
was
sufficiently
accustomed
to
be
able
to
regard
it
as
among
things
commonplace
the
rumbling
and
rattling
of
waggons
and
carts
the
loading
and
unloading
of
boxes
and
bales
the
people
who
are
late
and
the
people
who
are
early
the
faces
which
are
excited
and
the
faces
which
are
sad
the
trunks
and
bales
and
cranes
which
creak
and
groan
the
shouts
and
cries
the
hurry
and
confusion
of
movement
notwithstanding
that
every
day
has
seen
them
all
for
years
have
a
sort
of
perennial
interest
to
the
this
is
perhaps
more
especially
the
case
when
the
is
to
be
a
passenger
on
the
outgoing
ship
and
the
exhilaration
of
his
point
of
view
may
greatly
depend
upon
the
reason
for
his
voyage
and
the
class
by
which
he
travels
gaiety
and
youth
usually
appear
upon
the
promenade
deck
having
taken
saloon
passage
dulness
commerce
and
eld
mingling
with
them
it
is
true
but
with
a
discretion
which
does
not
seem
to
dominate
passengers
wear
a
more
practical
aspect
and
youth
among
them
is
rarer
and
more
grave
people
who
must
travel
second
and
third
class
make
voyages
for
utilitarian
reasons
their
object
is
usually
to
better
themselves
in
one
way
or
another
when
they
are
going
from
liverpool
to
new
york
it
is
usually
to
enter
upon
new
efforts
and
new
labours
when
they
are
returning
from
new
york
to
liverpool
it
is
often
because
the
new
life
has
proved
less
to
be
depended
upon
than
the
old
and
they
are
bearing
back
with
them
bitterness
of
soul
and
discouragement
of
spirit
on
the
brilliant
spring
morning
when
the
huge
liner
meridiana
was
to
sail
for
england
a
young
man
who
was
a
passenger
leaned
upon
the
ship
rail
and
watched
the
turmoil
on
the
wharf
with
a
detached
and
not
at
all
buoyant
air
his
air
was
detached
because
he
had
other
things
in
his
mind
than
those
merely
passing
before
him
and
he
was
not
buoyant
because
they
were
not
cheerful
or
encouraging
subjects
for
reflection
he
was
a
big
young
man
well
hung
together
and
carrying
himself
well
his
face
was
and
rugged
and
he
had
dark
red
hair
restrained
by
its
close
cut
from
waving
strongly
on
his
forehead
his
eyes
were
red
brown
and
a
few
dark
freckles
marked
his
clear
skin
he
was
of
the
order
of
man
one
looks
at
twice
having
looked
at
him
once
though
one
does
not
in
the
least
know
why
unless
one
finally
reaches
some
degree
of
intimacy
he
watched
the
vehicles
heavy
and
light
roll
into
the
big
building
and
deposit
their
freight
he
heard
the
voices
and
caught
the
sentences
of
instruction
and
comment
he
saw
boxes
and
bales
hauled
from
the
dock
side
to
the
deck
and
swung
below
with
the
rattling
of
machinery
and
chains
but
these
formed
merely
a
noisy
background
to
his
mood
which
was
and
gloomy
he
was
one
of
those
who
go
back
to
their
native
land
knowing
themselves
conquered
he
had
left
england
two
years
before
feeling
obstinately
determined
to
accomplish
a
certain
difficult
thing
but
forces
of
nature
combining
with
the
circumstances
of
previous
education
and
living
had
beaten
him
he
had
lost
two
years
and
all
the
money
he
had
ventured
he
was
going
back
to
the
place
he
had
come
from
and
he
was
carrying
with
him
a
sense
of
having
been
used
hardly
by
fortune
and
in
a
way
he
had
not
deserved
he
had
gone
out
to
the
west
with
the
intention
of
working
hard
and
using
his
hands
as
well
as
his
brains
he
had
not
been
squeamish
he
had
in
fact
laboured
like
a
ploughman
and
to
be
obliged
to
give
in
had
been
galling
and
bitter
there
are
human
beings
into
whose
consciousness
of
themselves
the
possibility
of
being
beaten
does
not
enter
this
man
was
one
of
them
the
ship
was
of
the
huge
and
class
by
which
the
rich
and
fortunate
are
transported
from
one
continent
to
another
passengers
could
indulge
themselves
in
suites
of
rooms
and
live
sumptuously
as
the
man
leaning
on
the
rail
looked
on
he
saw
messengers
bearing
baskets
and
boxes
of
fruit
and
flowers
with
cards
and
notes
attached
hurrying
up
the
gangway
to
deliver
them
to
waiting
stewards
these
were
the
farewell
offerings
to
be
placed
in
staterooms
or
to
await
their
owners
on
the
saloon
tables
salter
the
passenger
name
was
salter
had
seen
a
few
such
offerings
before
on
the
first
crossing
but
there
had
not
been
such
lavishness
at
liverpool
it
was
the
new
yorkers
who
were
sumptuous
in
such
matters
as
he
had
been
told
he
had
also
heard
casually
that
the
passenger
list
on
this
voyage
was
to
record
important
names
the
names
of
people
who
were
going
over
for
the
london
season
two
stewards
talking
near
him
earlier
in
the
morning
had
been
exulting
over
the
probable
largesse
such
a
list
would
result
in
at
the
end
of
the
passage
the
worthingtons
and
the
hirams
and
the
john
william
spayters
said
one
they
travel
all
right
they
know
what
they
want
and
they
want
a
good
deal
and
they
willing
to
pay
for
yes
they
not
school
teachers
going
over
to
improve
their
minds
and
contriving
to
cross
in
a
big
ship
by
economising
in
everything
else
miss
vanderpoel
sailing
with
the
worthingtons
she
got
the
best
suite
all
to
herself
she
bring
back
a
duke
or
one
of
those
prince
fellows
how
many
millions
has
vanderpoel
how
many
millions
how
many
hundred
millions
said
his
companion
gloating
cheerfully
over
the
vastness
of
unknown
possibilities
crossed
with
miss
vanderpoel
often
two
or
three
times
when
she
was
in
short
frocks
she
the
kind
of
girl
you
read
about
and
she
got
money
enough
to
buy
in
half
a
dozen
there
are
new
yorkers
who
wo
like
it
if
she
does
returned
the
other
there
been
too
much
money
going
out
of
the
country
her
suite
is
crammed
full
of
jack
roses
now
and
there
are
boxes
waiting
salter
moved
away
and
heard
no
more
he
moved
away
in
fact
because
he
was
conscious
that
to
a
man
in
his
case
this
dwelling
upon
millions
this
plethora
of
wealth
was
a
little
revolting
he
had
walked
down
broadway
and
seen
the
price
of
jacqueminot
roses
and
he
was
not
soothed
or
allured
at
this
particular
moment
by
the
picture
of
a
girl
whose
cabins
were
crowded
with
them
oh
the
devil
he
said
it
sounds
and
he
walked
up
and
down
fast
squaring
his
shoulders
with
his
hands
in
the
pockets
of
his
rough
coat
he
had
seen
in
england
something
of
the
american
young
woman
with
millionaire
relatives
he
had
been
scarcely
more
than
a
boy
when
the
american
flood
first
began
to
rise
he
had
been
old
enough
however
to
hear
people
talk
as
he
had
grown
older
salter
had
observed
its
advance
englishmen
had
married
american
beauties
american
fortunes
had
built
up
english
houses
which
otherwise
threatened
to
fall
into
decay
then
the
american
faculty
of
adaptability
came
into
play
wives
became
sometimes
more
english
than
their
husbands
they
proceeded
to
anglicise
their
relations
their
relations
clothes
even
in
time
their
speech
they
carried
or
sent
english
conventions
to
the
states
their
brothers
ordered
their
clothes
from
west
end
tailors
their
sisters
began
to
wear
walking
dresses
to
play
games
and
take
active
exercise
their
mothers
tentatively
took
houses
in
london
or
paris
there
came
a
period
when
their
fathers
or
uncles
serious
or
anxious
business
men
the
most
unsporting
of
human
beings
rented
castles
or
manors
with
huge
moors
and
covers
attached
and
entertained
large
parties
of
shooters
or
fishers
who
could
be
lured
to
any
quarter
by
the
promise
of
the
particular
form
of
slaughter
for
which
they
burned
sheer
american
business
perspicacity
that
said
salter
as
he
marched
up
and
down
thinking
of
a
particular
case
of
this
order
something
admirable
in
the
practical
way
they
make
for
what
they
want
they
want
to
amalgamate
with
english
people
not
for
their
own
sake
but
because
their
women
like
it
and
so
they
offer
the
men
thousands
of
acres
full
of
things
to
kill
they
can
get
them
by
paying
for
them
and
they
know
how
to
he
laughed
a
little
lifting
his
square
shoulders
balthamor
six
thousand
acres
of
grouse
moor
and
salmon
fishing
are
rented
by
the
chicago
man
he
does
care
twopence
for
them
and
does
not
know
a
pheasant
from
a
but
his
wife
wants
to
know
men
who
it
must
be
confessed
that
salter
was
of
the
english
who
were
not
pleased
with
the
american
invasion
in
some
of
his
views
of
the
matter
he
was
a
little
prehistoric
and
savage
but
the
modern
side
of
his
character
was
too
intelligent
to
lack
reason
he
was
by
no
means
entirely
modern
however
a
large
part
of
his
nature
belonged
to
the
age
in
which
men
had
fought
fiercely
for
what
they
wanted
to
get
or
keep
and
when
the
amenities
of
commerce
had
not
become
powerful
factors
in
existence
they
not
a
bad
lot
he
was
thinking
at
this
moment
they
are
rather
fine
in
a
way
they
are
clever
and
powerful
and
interesting
more
so
than
they
know
themselves
but
it
is
all
commerce
they
do
come
and
fight
with
us
and
get
possession
of
us
by
force
they
come
and
buy
us
they
buy
our
land
and
our
homes
and
our
landowners
for
that
matter
when
they
do
buy
them
they
send
their
women
to
marry
them
confound
it
he
took
half
a
dozen
more
strides
and
lifted
his
shoulders
again
beggarly
lot
as
i
am
he
said
unlikely
as
it
seems
that
i
can
marry
at
all
i
hanged
if
i
do
marry
an
englishwoman
if
i
give
my
life
to
a
woman
at
but
in
fact
he
was
of
the
opinion
that
he
should
never
give
his
life
to
any
woman
and
this
was
because
he
was
at
this
period
also
of
the
opinion
that
there
was
small
prospect
of
its
ever
being
worth
the
giving
or
taking
it
had
been
one
of
those
lives
which
begin
untowardly
and
are
ruled
by
unfair
circumstances
he
had
a
particularly
and
expressive
mouth
and
as
he
went
back
to
the
ship
side
and
leaned
on
his
folded
arms
on
the
rail
again
its
curves
concealed
a
good
deal
of
strong
feeling
the
wharf
was
busier
than
before
in
less
than
half
an
hour
the
ship
was
to
sail
the
bustle
and
confusion
had
increased
there
were
people
hurrying
about
looking
for
friends
and
there
were
people
scribbling
off
excited
farewell
messages
at
the
telegraph
office
the
situation
was
working
up
to
its
climax
an
observing
might
catch
glimpses
of
emotional
scenes
many
of
the
passengers
were
already
on
board
parties
of
them
accompanied
by
their
friends
were
making
their
way
up
the
gangplank
salter
had
just
been
watching
a
luxuriously
little
invalid
woman
being
carried
on
deck
in
a
reclining
chair
when
his
attention
was
attracted
by
the
sound
of
trampling
hoofs
and
rolling
wheels
two
noticeably
big
and
smart
carriages
had
driven
up
to
the
for
vehicles
they
were
gorgeously
of
the
latest
mode
and
their
tall
horses
jangled
silver
chains
and
stepped
up
to
their
noses
here
come
the
worthingtons
whosoever
they
may
be
thought
salter
the
fine
young
woman
is
no
doubt
the
the
fine
young
woman
was
the
bettina
walked
up
the
gangway
in
the
sunshine
and
the
passengers
upon
the
upper
deck
craned
their
necks
to
look
at
her
her
carriage
of
her
head
and
shoulders
invariably
made
people
turn
to
look
my
ai
she
exclaimed
an
excited
lady
beholder
above
i
guess
that
must
be
miss
vanderpoel
the
daughter
jane
told
me
she
heard
she
was
crossing
this
bettina
heard
her
she
sometimes
wondered
if
she
was
ever
pointed
out
if
her
name
was
ever
mentioned
without
the
addition
of
the
explanatory
statement
that
she
was
the
daughter
as
a
child
she
had
thought
it
ridiculous
and
tiresome
as
she
had
grown
older
she
had
felt
that
only
a
remarkable
individuality
could
surmount
a
fact
so
ever
present
it
was
like
a
tremendous
quality
which
overshadowed
everything
else
it
wounds
my
vanity
i
have
no
doubt
she
had
said
to
her
father
nobody
ever
sees
me
they
only
see
you
and
your
millions
and
millions
of
salter
watched
her
pass
up
the
gangway
the
phase
through
which
he
was
living
was
not
of
the
order
which
leads
a
man
to
dwell
upon
the
beautiful
and
inspiriting
as
expressed
by
the
female
image
success
and
the
hopefulness
which
engender
warmth
of
soul
and
quickness
of
heart
are
required
for
the
development
of
such
allurements
he
thought
of
the
vanderpoel
millions
as
the
lady
on
the
deck
had
thought
of
them
and
in
his
mind
somehow
the
girl
herself
appeared
to
express
them
the
rich
sweep
of
her
abundant
hair
her
height
her
colouring
the
remarkable
shade
and
length
of
her
lashes
the
full
curve
of
her
mouth
all
he
told
himself
looked
expensive
as
if
even
nature
herself
had
been
given
carte
blanche
and
the
best
possible
articles
procured
for
the
money
she
moves
he
thought
sardonically
as
if
she
were
perfectly
aware
that
she
could
pay
for
anything
an
unlimited
income
no
doubt
establishes
in
the
owner
the
equivalent
to
a
sense
of
he
changed
his
position
for
one
in
which
he
could
command
a
view
of
the
promenade
deck
where
the
arriving
passengers
were
gradually
appearing
he
did
this
from
the
idle
and
careless
curiosity
which
though
it
is
not
a
matter
of
absolute
interest
does
not
object
to
being
entertained
by
passing
objects
he
saw
the
worthington
party
reappear
it
struck
salter
that
they
looked
not
so
much
like
persons
coming
on
board
a
ship
as
like
people
who
were
returning
to
a
hotel
to
which
they
were
accustomed
and
which
was
also
accustomed
to
them
he
argued
that
they
had
probably
crossed
the
atlantic
innumerable
times
in
this
particular
steamer
the
deck
stewards
knew
them
and
made
obeisance
with
empressement
miss
vanderpoel
nodded
to
the
steward
salter
had
heard
discussing
her
she
gave
him
a
smile
of
recognition
and
paused
a
moment
to
speak
to
him
salter
saw
her
sweep
the
deck
with
her
glance
and
then
designate
a
sequestered
corner
such
as
the
experienced
voyager
would
recognise
as
being
desirably
sheltered
she
was
evidently
giving
an
order
concerning
the
placing
of
her
deck
chair
which
was
presently
brought
an
elegantly
neat
and
decorous
person
in
black
who
was
evidently
her
maid
appeared
later
followed
by
a
steward
who
carried
cushions
and
sumptuous
fur
rugs
these
being
arranged
a
delightful
corner
was
left
alluringly
prepared
miss
vanderpoel
after
her
instructions
to
the
deck
steward
had
joined
her
party
and
seemed
to
be
awaiting
some
arrival
anxiously
she
knows
how
to
do
herself
well
salter
commented
and
she
realises
that
forethought
is
a
practical
factor
millions
have
been
productive
of
composure
it
is
not
unnatural
it
was
but
a
short
time
later
that
the
warning
bell
was
rung
stewards
passed
through
the
crowds
calling
out
all
ashore
if
you
please
all
final
embraces
were
in
order
on
all
sides
people
shook
hands
with
fervour
and
laughed
a
little
nervously
women
kissed
each
other
and
poured
forth
hurried
messages
to
be
delivered
on
the
other
side
of
the
atlantic
having
kissed
and
parted
some
of
them
rushed
back
and
indulged
in
little
clutches
again
notwithstanding
that
the
tide
of
humanity
surges
across
the
atlantic
almost
as
regularly
as
the
daily
tide
surges
in
on
its
shores
a
wave
of
emotion
sweeps
through
every
ship
at
such
partings
salter
stood
on
deck
and
watched
the
crowd
dispersing
some
of
the
people
were
laughing
and
some
had
red
eyes
groups
collected
on
the
wharf
and
tried
to
say
still
more
last
words
to
their
friends
crowding
against
the
rail
the
worthingtons
kept
their
places
and
were
still
looking
out
by
this
time
disappointedly
it
seemed
that
the
friend
or
friends
they
expected
were
not
coming
salter
saw
that
miss
vanderpoel
looked
more
disappointed
than
the
rest
she
leaned
forward
and
strained
her
eyes
to
see
just
at
the
last
moment
there
was
the
sound
of
trampling
horses
and
rolling
wheels
again
from
the
arriving
carriage
descended
hastily
an
elderly
woman
who
lifted
out
a
little
boy
excited
almost
to
tears
he
was
a
dear
chubby
little
person
in
flapping
sailor
trousers
and
he
carried
a
toy
donkey
in
his
arms
salter
could
not
help
feeling
slightly
excited
himself
as
they
rushed
forward
he
wondered
if
they
were
passengers
who
would
be
left
behind
they
were
not
passengers
but
the
arrivals
miss
vanderpoel
had
been
expecting
so
ardently
they
had
come
to
say
to
her
and
were
too
late
for
that
at
least
as
the
gangway
was
just
about
to
be
withdrawn
miss
vanderpoel
leaned
forward
with
an
amazingly
fervid
expression
on
her
face
tommy
tommy
she
cried
to
the
little
boy
here
i
am
tommy
we
can
say
from
the
little
boy
looking
up
broke
into
a
wail
of
despair
betty
betty
betty
he
cried
i
wanted
to
kiss
you
betty
held
out
her
arms
she
did
it
with
entire
forgetfulness
of
the
existence
of
any
and
with
such
outreaching
love
on
her
face
that
it
seemed
as
if
the
child
must
feel
her
touch
she
made
a
beautiful
warm
consoling
bud
of
her
mouth
we
kiss
each
other
from
here
tommy
she
said
see
we
can
kiss
me
and
i
will
kiss
tommy
held
out
his
arms
and
the
magnificent
donkey
betty
he
cried
i
brought
you
my
donkey
i
wanted
to
give
it
to
you
for
a
present
because
you
liked
miss
vanderpoel
bent
further
forward
and
addressed
the
elderly
woman
matilda
she
said
please
pack
master
tommy
present
and
send
it
to
me
i
want
it
very
tender
smiles
irradiated
the
small
face
the
gangway
was
withdrawn
and
amid
the
familiar
sounds
of
a
big
craft
first
struggle
the
ship
began
to
move
miss
vanderpoel
still
bent
forward
and
held
out
her
arms
i
will
soon
come
back
tommy
she
cried
and
we
are
always
the
child
held
out
his
short
blue
serge
arms
also
and
salter
watching
him
could
not
but
be
touched
for
all
his
gloom
of
mind
i
wanted
to
kiss
you
betty
he
heard
in
farewell
i
did
so
want
to
kiss
and
so
they
steamed
away
upon
the
blue
chapter
viii
the
passenger
up
to
a
certain
point
the
voyage
was
like
all
other
voyages
during
the
first
two
days
there
were
passengers
who
did
not
appear
on
deck
but
as
the
weather
was
fair
for
the
season
of
the
year
there
were
fewer
absentees
than
is
usual
indeed
on
the
third
day
the
deck
chairs
were
all
filled
people
who
were
given
to
tramping
during
their
voyages
had
begun
to
walk
their
customary
quota
of
miles
the
day
there
were
a
few
pale
faces
dozing
here
and
there
but
the
general
aspect
of
things
had
begun
to
be
sprightly
shuffleboard
players
and
quoit
enthusiasts
began
to
bestir
themselves
the
deck
steward
appeared
regularly
with
light
repasts
of
beef
tea
and
biscuits
and
the
brilliant
hues
of
red
blue
or
yellow
novels
made
frequent
spots
of
colour
upon
the
promenade
persons
of
some
initiative
went
to
the
length
of
making
tentative
observations
to
their
neighbours
the
passengers
were
cheerful
and
the
steerage
passengers
having
tumbled
up
formed
friendly
groups
and
began
to
joke
with
each
other
the
worthingtons
had
plainly
the
good
fortune
to
be
respectable
sailors
they
reappeared
on
the
second
day
and
established
regular
habits
after
the
manner
of
accustomed
travellers
miss
vanderpoel
habits
were
regular
from
the
first
and
when
salter
saw
her
he
was
impressed
even
more
at
the
outset
with
her
air
of
being
at
home
instead
of
on
board
ship
her
practically
corner
was
an
agreeable
place
to
look
at
her
chair
was
built
for
ease
of
angle
and
width
her
cushions
were
of
dark
rich
colours
her
travelling
rugs
were
of
black
fox
fur
and
she
owned
an
adjustable
table
for
books
and
accompaniments
she
appeared
early
in
the
morning
and
walked
until
the
sea
air
crimsoned
her
cheeks
she
sat
and
read
with
evident
enjoyment
she
talked
to
her
companions
and
plainly
entertained
them
salter
being
bored
and
in
bad
spirits
found
himself
watching
her
rather
often
but
he
knew
that
but
for
the
small
comic
episode
of
tommy
he
would
have
definitely
disliked
her
the
dislike
would
not
have
been
fair
but
it
would
have
existed
in
spite
of
himself
it
would
not
have
been
fair
because
it
would
have
been
founded
simply
upon
the
ignoble
resentment
of
envy
upon
the
poor
truth
that
he
was
not
in
the
state
of
mind
to
avoid
resenting
the
injustice
of
fate
in
bestowing
upon
one
person
and
his
offspring
he
resented
his
own
resentment
but
was
obliged
to
acknowledge
its
existence
in
his
humour
he
himself
especially
and
peculiarly
had
always
known
the
bitterness
of
poverty
the
humiliation
of
seeing
where
money
could
be
well
used
indeed
ought
to
be
used
and
at
the
same
time
having
ground
into
him
the
fact
that
there
was
no
money
to
lay
one
hand
on
he
had
hated
it
even
as
a
boy
because
in
his
case
and
that
of
his
people
the
whole
thing
was
undignified
and
unbecoming
it
was
humiliating
to
him
now
to
bring
home
to
himself
the
fact
that
the
thing
for
which
he
was
inclined
to
dislike
this
tall
girl
was
her
unconscious
he
realised
the
unconsciousness
of
it
air
of
having
always
lived
in
the
atmosphere
of
millions
of
never
having
known
a
reason
why
she
should
not
have
anything
she
had
a
desire
for
perhaps
upon
the
whole
he
said
to
himself
it
was
his
own
ill
luck
and
sense
of
defeat
which
made
her
corner
with
its
cushions
and
comforts
her
properly
attentive
maid
and
her
cold
weather
sables
expressive
of
a
fortune
too
colossal
to
be
decent
the
episode
of
the
plump
despairing
tommy
he
had
liked
however
there
had
been
a
fine
naturalness
about
it
and
a
fine
practicalness
in
her
prompt
order
to
the
elderly
nurse
that
the
donkey
should
be
sent
to
her
this
had
at
once
made
it
clear
to
the
donor
that
his
gift
was
too
valuable
to
be
left
behind
she
did
not
care
twopence
for
the
lot
of
us
was
his
summing
up
she
might
have
been
nothing
but
the
nicest
possible
nursemaid
or
a
cottage
woman
who
loved
the
he
was
quite
aware
that
though
he
had
found
himself
more
than
once
observing
her
she
herself
had
probably
not
recognised
the
trivial
fact
of
his
existing
upon
that
other
side
of
the
barrier
which
separated
the
higher
grade
of
passenger
from
the
lower
there
was
indeed
no
reason
why
she
should
have
singled
him
out
for
observation
and
she
was
in
fact
too
frequently
absorbed
in
her
own
reflections
to
be
in
the
frame
of
mind
to
remark
her
fellow
passengers
to
the
extent
which
was
generally
customary
with
her
during
her
crossings
of
the
atlantic
she
usually
made
mental
observation
of
the
people
on
board
this
time
when
she
was
not
talking
to
the
worthingtons
or
reading
she
was
thinking
of
the
possibilities
of
her
visit
to
stornham
she
used
to
walk
about
the
deck
thinking
of
them
and
sitting
in
her
chair
sum
them
up
as
her
eyes
rested
on
the
rolling
and
breaking
waves
there
were
many
things
to
be
considered
and
one
of
the
first
was
the
perfectly
sane
suggestion
her
father
had
made
suppose
she
does
not
want
to
be
rescued
suppose
you
find
her
a
comfortable
fine
lady
who
adores
her
such
a
thing
was
possible
though
bettina
did
not
think
it
probable
she
intended
however
to
prepare
herself
even
for
this
if
she
found
lady
anstruthers
plump
and
roseate
pleased
with
herself
and
her
position
she
was
quite
equal
to
making
her
visit
appear
a
casual
and
conventional
affair
i
ought
to
wish
it
to
be
so
she
thought
and
yet
how
disappointingly
i
should
feel
she
had
changed
still
even
ethical
reasons
would
not
excuse
one
for
wishing
her
to
be
she
was
a
creature
with
a
number
of
passionate
ideals
which
warred
frequently
with
the
practical
side
of
her
mentality
often
she
used
to
walk
up
and
down
the
deck
or
lean
upon
the
ship
side
her
eyes
stormy
with
emotions
i
do
not
want
to
find
rosy
a
heartless
woman
and
i
do
not
want
to
find
her
wretched
what
do
i
want
only
the
usual
thing
that
what
can
not
be
undone
had
never
been
done
people
are
always
wishing
she
was
standing
near
the
barrier
thinking
this
the
first
time
she
saw
the
passenger
with
the
red
hair
she
had
paused
by
mere
chance
and
while
her
eyes
were
stormy
with
her
thought
she
suddenly
became
conscious
that
she
was
looking
directly
into
other
eyes
as
darkling
as
her
own
they
were
those
of
a
man
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
barrier
he
had
a
troubled
brooding
face
and
as
their
gaze
met
each
of
them
started
slightly
and
turned
away
with
the
sense
of
having
unconsciously
intruded
and
having
been
intruded
upon
that
man
she
commented
to
herself
is
as
anxious
and
disturbed
as
i
salter
did
look
rough
it
was
true
his
clothes
had
suffered
somewhat
from
the
restrictions
of
a
cabin
shared
with
two
other
men
but
the
aspect
which
had
presented
itself
to
her
brief
glance
had
been
not
so
much
roughness
of
clothing
as
of
mood
expressing
itself
in
his
countenance
he
was
thinking
harshly
and
angrily
of
the
life
ahead
of
him
these
looks
of
theirs
which
had
so
inadvertently
encountered
each
other
were
of
that
order
which
sometimes
startles
one
when
in
passing
a
stranger
one
finds
one
eyes
entangled
for
a
second
in
his
or
hers
as
the
case
may
be
at
such
times
it
seems
for
that
instant
difficult
to
disentangle
one
gaze
but
neither
of
these
two
thought
of
the
other
much
after
hurrying
away
each
was
too
fully
mastered
by
personal
mood
there
would
indeed
have
been
no
reason
for
their
encountering
each
other
further
but
for
the
accident
as
it
was
called
when
spoken
of
afterwards
the
accident
which
might
so
easily
have
been
a
catastrophe
it
occurred
that
night
this
was
two
nights
before
they
were
to
land
everybody
had
begun
to
come
under
the
influence
of
that
cheerfulness
of
humour
the
sense
of
relief
bordering
on
gaiety
which
generally
elates
people
when
a
voyage
is
drawing
to
a
close
if
one
has
been
dull
one
begins
to
gather
one
self
together
rejoiced
that
the
boredom
is
over
in
any
case
there
are
plans
to
be
made
thought
of
or
discussed
you
wish
to
go
to
stornham
at
once
worthington
said
to
bettina
how
pleased
lady
anstruthers
and
sir
nigel
must
be
at
the
idea
of
seeing
you
with
them
after
so
i
can
scarcely
tell
you
how
i
am
looking
forward
to
it
betty
answered
she
sat
in
her
corner
among
her
cushions
looking
at
the
dark
water
which
seemed
to
sweep
past
the
ship
and
listening
to
the
throb
of
the
engines
she
was
not
gay
she
was
wondering
how
far
the
plans
she
had
made
would
prove
feasible
worthington
was
not
aware
that
her
visit
to
stornham
court
was
to
be
unannounced
it
had
not
been
necessary
to
explain
the
matter
the
whole
affair
was
simple
and
decorous
enough
miss
vanderpoel
was
to
bid
to
her
friends
and
go
at
once
to
her
sister
lady
anstruthers
whose
husband
country
seat
was
but
a
short
journey
from
london
bettina
and
her
father
had
arranged
that
the
fact
should
be
kept
from
the
society
paragraphist
this
had
required
some
adroit
management
but
had
actually
been
accomplished
as
the
waves
swished
past
her
bettina
was
saying
to
herself
what
will
rosy
say
when
she
sees
me
what
shall
i
say
when
i
see
rosy
we
are
drawing
nearer
to
each
other
with
every
wave
that
a
fog
which
swept
up
suddenly
sent
them
all
below
rather
early
the
worthingtons
laughed
and
talked
a
little
in
their
staterooms
but
presently
became
quiet
and
had
evidently
gone
to
bed
bettina
was
restless
and
moved
about
her
room
alone
after
she
had
sent
away
her
maid
she
at
last
sat
down
and
finished
a
letter
she
had
been
writing
to
her
father
as
i
near
the
land
she
wrote
i
feel
a
sort
of
excitement
several
times
i
have
recalled
so
distinctly
the
picture
of
rosy
as
i
saw
her
last
when
we
all
stood
crowded
upon
the
wharf
at
new
york
to
see
her
off
she
and
nigel
were
leaning
upon
the
rail
of
the
upper
deck
she
looked
such
a
delicate
airy
little
creature
quite
like
a
pretty
schoolgirl
with
tears
in
her
eyes
she
was
laughing
and
crying
at
the
same
time
and
kissing
both
her
hands
to
us
again
and
again
i
was
crying
passionately
myself
though
i
tried
to
conceal
the
fact
and
i
remember
that
each
time
i
looked
from
rosy
to
nigel
heavy
face
the
poignancy
of
my
anguish
made
me
break
forth
again
i
wonder
if
it
was
because
i
was
a
child
that
he
looked
such
a
contemptuous
brute
even
when
he
pretended
to
smile
it
is
twelve
years
since
then
i
wonder
how
i
wonder
what
i
shall
she
stopped
writing
and
sat
a
few
moments
her
chin
upon
her
hand
thinking
suddenly
she
sprang
to
her
feet
in
alarm
the
stillness
of
the
night
was
broken
by
wild
shouts
a
running
of
feet
outside
a
tumult
of
mingled
sounds
and
motion
a
dash
and
rush
of
surging
water
a
strange
thumping
and
straining
of
engines
and
a
moment
later
she
was
hurled
from
one
side
of
her
stateroom
to
the
other
by
a
crashing
shock
which
seemed
to
heave
the
ship
out
of
the
sea
shuddering
as
if
the
end
of
all
things
had
come
it
was
so
sudden
and
horrible
a
thing
that
though
she
had
only
been
flung
upon
a
pile
of
rugs
and
cushions
and
was
unhurt
she
felt
as
if
she
had
been
struck
on
the
head
and
plunged
into
wild
delirium
above
the
sound
of
the
dashing
and
rocking
waves
the
straining
and
roaring
of
hacking
engines
and
the
pandemonium
of
voices
rose
from
one
end
of
the
ship
to
the
other
one
wild
despairing
shriek
of
women
and
children
bettina
turned
sick
at
the
mad
terror
in
it
the
insensate
awful
horror
something
has
run
into
us
she
gasped
getting
up
with
her
heart
leaping
in
her
throat
she
could
hear
the
worthingtons
tempest
of
terrified
confusion
through
the
partitions
between
them
and
she
remembered
afterwards
that
in
the
space
of
two
or
three
seconds
and
in
the
midst
of
their
clamour
a
hundred
incongruous
thoughts
leaped
through
her
brain
perhaps
they
were
this
moment
going
down
now
she
knew
what
it
was
like
this
thing
she
had
read
of
in
newspapers
now
she
was
going
down
in
she
betty
vanderpoel
and
as
she
sprang
to
clutch
her
fur
coat
there
flashed
before
her
mental
vision
a
gruesome
picture
of
the
headlines
in
the
newspapers
and
the
inevitable
reference
to
the
millions
she
represented
i
must
keep
calm
she
heard
herself
say
as
she
fastened
the
long
coat
clenching
her
teeth
to
keep
them
from
chattering
poor
daddy
poor
daddy
maddening
new
sounds
were
all
about
her
sounds
of
water
dashing
and
churning
sounds
of
voices
bellowing
out
commands
straining
and
leaping
sounds
of
the
engines
what
was
it
what
was
it
she
must
at
least
find
out
everybody
was
going
mad
in
the
staterooms
the
stewards
were
rushing
about
trying
to
quiet
people
their
own
voices
shaking
and
breaking
into
cracked
notes
if
the
worst
had
happened
everyone
would
be
fighting
for
life
in
a
few
minutes
out
on
deck
she
must
get
and
find
out
for
herself
what
the
worst
was
she
was
the
first
woman
outside
though
the
wails
and
shrieks
swelled
below
and
ghastly
creatures
tumbled
gasping
up
the
what
is
it
she
heard
my
god
what
happened
where
the
captain
are
we
going
down
the
boats
the
boats
it
was
useless
to
speak
to
the
seamen
rushing
by
they
did
not
see
much
less
hear
she
caught
sight
of
a
man
who
could
not
be
a
sailor
since
he
was
standing
still
she
made
her
way
to
him
thankful
that
she
had
managed
to
stop
her
teeth
chattering
what
has
happened
to
us
she
said
he
turned
and
looked
at
her
straitly
he
was
the
passenger
with
the
red
hair
a
tramp
steamer
has
run
into
us
in
the
fog
he
answered
how
much
harm
is
done
they
are
trying
to
find
out
i
am
standing
here
on
the
chance
of
hearing
something
it
is
madness
to
ask
any
man
they
spoke
to
each
other
in
short
sharp
sentences
knowing
there
was
no
time
to
lose
are
you
horribly
frightened
he
asked
she
stamped
her
foot
i
hate
it
i
hate
it
she
said
flinging
out
her
hand
towards
the
black
heaving
water
the
plunge
the
choking
no
one
could
hate
it
more
but
i
want
to
do
something
she
was
turning
away
when
he
caught
her
hand
and
held
her
wait
a
second
he
said
i
hate
it
as
much
as
you
do
but
i
believe
we
two
can
keep
our
heads
those
who
can
do
that
may
help
perhaps
let
us
try
to
quiet
the
people
as
soon
as
i
find
out
anything
i
will
come
to
your
friends
stateroom
you
are
near
the
boats
there
then
i
shall
go
back
to
the
second
cabin
you
work
on
your
side
and
i
work
on
mine
that
thank
you
tell
the
worthingtons
i
going
to
the
saloon
she
was
off
as
she
spoke
upon
the
stairway
she
found
herself
in
the
midst
of
a
struggling
mob
tripping
over
each
other
on
the
steps
and
clutching
at
any
garment
nearest
to
drag
themselves
up
as
they
fell
or
were
on
the
point
of
falling
everyone
was
crying
out
in
question
and
appeal
bettina
stood
still
a
firm
tall
obstacle
and
clutched
at
the
hysteric
woman
who
was
hurled
against
her
i
been
on
deck
she
said
a
tramp
steamer
has
run
into
us
no
one
has
time
to
answer
questions
the
first
thing
to
do
is
to
put
on
warm
clothes
and
secure
the
life
belts
in
case
you
need
at
once
everyone
turned
upon
her
as
if
she
was
an
authority
she
replied
with
almost
fierce
determination
to
the
torrent
of
words
poured
forth
i
know
nothing
further
only
that
if
one
is
not
a
fool
one
must
make
sure
of
clothes
and
quite
right
miss
vanderpoel
said
one
young
man
touching
his
cap
in
nervous
propitiation
stop
screaming
betty
said
mercilessly
to
the
woman
idiotic
the
more
noise
you
make
the
less
chance
you
have
how
can
men
keep
their
wits
among
a
mob
of
shrieking
mad
women
that
the
remote
miss
vanderpoel
should
have
emerged
from
her
luxurious
corner
to
frankly
bully
the
lot
of
them
was
an
excellent
shock
for
the
crowd
men
who
had
been
in
danger
of
losing
their
heads
and
becoming
as
uncontrolled
as
the
women
suddenly
realised
the
fact
and
pulled
themselves
together
bettina
made
her
way
at
once
to
the
staterooms
there
she
found
frenzy
reigning
blanche
and
marie
worthington
were
darting
to
and
fro
dragging
about
first
one
thing
and
then
another
they
were
silly
with
fright
and
dashed
at
and
dropped
alternately
life
belts
shoes
jewel
cases
and
wraps
while
they
sobbed
and
cried
out
hysterically
oh
what
shall
we
do
with
mother
what
shall
we
do
the
manners
of
betty
vanderpoel
sharp
schoolgirl
days
returned
to
her
in
full
force
she
seized
blanche
by
the
shoulder
and
shook
her
what
a
donkey
you
are
she
said
put
on
your
clothes
there
they
are
pushing
her
to
the
place
where
they
hung
marie

this
moment

may
be
in
no
real
danger
at
do
you
think

they
wailed
in
concert
oh
what
shall
we
do
with
mother
where

your
mother
she
fainted
louise
betty
was
in
worthington
cabin
before
they
had
finished
speaking
the
poor
woman
had
fainted
and
struck
her
cheek
against
a
chair
she
lay
on
the
floor
in
her
nightgown
with
blood
trickling
from
a
cut
on
her
face
her
maid
louise
was
wringing
her
hands
and
doing
nothing
whatever
if
you
do
bring
the
brandy
this
minute
said
the
beautiful
miss
vanderpoel
i
box
your
ears
believe
me
my
she
looked
so
capable
of
doing
it
that
the
woman
was
startled
and
actually
offended
into
a
return
of
her
senses
miss
vanderpoel
had
usually
the
best
possible
manners
in
dealing
with
her
inferiors
betty
poured
brandy
down
worthington
throat
and
applied
strong
smelling
salts
until
she
gasped
back
to
consciousness
she
had
just
burst
into
frightened
sobs
when
betty
heard
confusion
and
exclamations
in
the
adjoining
room
blanche
and
marie
had
cried
out
and
a
voice
was
speaking
betty
went
to
them
they
were
in
various
stages
of
undress
and
the
passenger
was
standing
at
the
door
i
promised
miss
vanderpoel
he
was
saying
when
betty
came
forward
he
turned
to
her
promptly
i
come
to
tell
you
that
it
seems
absolutely
to
be
relied
on
that
there
is
no
immediate
danger
the
tramp
is
more
injured
than
we
oh
are
you
sure
are
you
sure
panted
blanche
catching
at
his
sleeve
yes
he
answered
can
i
do
anything
for
you
he
said
to
bettina
who
was
on
the
point
of
speaking
will
you
be
good
enough
to
help
me
to
assist
worthington
into
her
berth
and
then
try
to
find
the
he
went
into
the
next
room
without
speaking
to
worthington
he
spoke
briefly
a
few
words
of
reassurance
he
was
a
powerful
man
and
laid
her
on
her
berth
without
dragging
her
about
uncomfortably
or
making
her
feel
that
her
weight
was
greater
than
even
in
her
most
desponding
moments
she
had
suspected
even
her
helplessly
hysteric
mood
was
illuminated
by
a
ray
of
grateful
appreciation
oh
thank
you
thank
you
she
murmured
and
you
are
quite
sure
there
is
no
actual
danger
salter
he
terminated
for
her
you
may
feel
safe
the
damage
is
really
only
slight
after
it
is
so
good
of
you
to
come
and
tell
us
said
the
poor
lady
still
tremulous
the
shock
was
awful
our
introduction
has
been
an
alarming
one
i
i
do
think
we
have
met
during
the
no
replied
salter
i
am
in
the
second
oh
thank
you
it
so
good
of
you
she
faltered
amiably
for
want
of
inspiration
as
he
went
out
of
the
stateroom
salter
spoke
to
bettina
i
will
send
the
doctor
if
i
can
find
him
he
said
i
think
perhaps
you
had
better
take
some
brandy
yourself
i
it
queer
how
little
one
seems
to
realise
even
that
there
are
passengers
commented
worthington
feebly
that
was
a
nice
man
and
perfectly
respectable
he
even
had
a
kind
of
of
chapter
ix
lady
jane
grey
it
seemed
upon
the
whole
even
absurd
that
after
a
shock
so
awful
and
a
panic
wild
enough
to
cause
people
to
expose
their
very
souls
for
there
were
of
course
endless
anecdotes
to
be
related
afterwards
illustrative
of
grotesque
terror
cowardice
and
utter
abandonment
of
all
shadows
of
convention
that
all
should
end
in
an
anticlimax
of
trifling
danger
upon
which
in
a
day
or
two
jokes
might
be
made
even
the
tramp
steamer
had
not
been
seriously
injured
though
its
injuries
were
likely
to
be
less
easy
of
repair
than
those
of
the
meridiana
still
as
a
passenger
remarked
when
she
steamed
into
the
dock
at
liverpool
we
might
all
be
at
the
bottom
of
the
atlantic
ocean
this
morning
just
think
what
columns
there
would
have
been
in
the
newspapers
imagine
miss
vanderpoel
being
i
was
very
rude
to
louise
when
i
found
her
wringing
her
hands
over
you
and
i
was
rude
to
blanche
bettina
said
to
worthington
in
fact
i
believe
i
was
rude
to
a
number
of
people
that
night
i
am
rather
you
called
me
a
donkey
said
blanche
but
it
was
the
best
thing
you
could
have
done
you
frightened
me
into
putting
on
my
shoes
instead
of
trying
to
comb
my
hair
with
them
it
was
startling
to
see
you
march
into
the
stateroom
the
only
person
who
had
not
been
turned
into
a
gibbering
idiot
i
know
i
was
gibbering
and
i
know
marie
we
both
gibbered
at
the
man
when
he
came
in
said
marie
we
clutched
at
him
and
gibbered
together
where
is
the
man
betty
perhaps
we
made
him
ill
i
not
seen
him
since
that
he
is
in
the
second
cabin
i
suppose
bettina
answered
but
i
have
not
seen
him
we
ought
to
get
up
a
testimonial
and
give
it
to
him
because
he
did
not
gibber
said
blanche
he
was
as
rude
and
as
sensible
as
you
were
they
did
not
see
him
again
in
fact
at
that
time
he
had
reasons
of
his
own
for
preferring
to
remain
unseen
the
truth
was
that
the
nearer
his
approach
to
his
native
shores
the
nastier
he
was
perfectly
conscious
his
temper
became
and
he
did
not
wish
to
expose
himself
by
any
incident
which
might
cause
him
stupidly
and
obviously
to
lose
it
the
maid
louise
however
recognised
him
among
her
companions
in
the
carriage
in
which
she
travelled
to
town
to
her
mind
whose
opinions
were
regulated
by
neatly
arranged
standards
he
looked
morose
and
shabbily
dressed
some
of
the
other
passengers
had
made
themselves
quite
smart
in
various
not
too
distinguished
ways
he
had
not
changed
his
dress
at
all
and
the
large
valise
upon
the
luggage
rack
was
worn
and
battered
as
if
with
long
and
rough
usage
the
woman
wondered
a
little
if
he
would
address
her
and
inquire
after
the
health
of
her
mistress
but
being
an
astute
creature
she
only
wondered
this
for
an
instant
the
next
she
realised
that
for
one
reason
or
another
it
was
clear
that
he
was
not
of
the
tribe
of
persons
who
pursue
an
accidental
acquaintance
with
their
superiors
in
fortune
through
sociable
interchange
with
their
footmen
or
maids
when
the
train
slackened
its
speed
at
the
platform
of
the
station
he
got
up
reaching
down
his
valise
and
leaving
the
carriage
strode
to
the
nearest
hansom
cab
waving
the
porter
aside
charing
cross
he
called
out
to
the
driver
jumped
in
and
was
rattled
away
during
the
years
which
had
passed
since
rosalie
vanderpoel
first
came
to
london
as
lady
anstruthers
numbers
of
huge
luxurious
hotels
had
grown
up
principally
as
it
seemed
that
americans
should
swarm
into
them
and
live
at
an
expense
which
reminded
them
of
their
native
land
such
establishments
would
never
have
been
built
for
english
people
whose
habit
it
is
merely
to
stop
at
hotels
not
to
live
in
them
the
tendency
of
the
american
is
to
live
in
his
hotel
even
though
his
intention
may
be
only
to
remain
in
it
two
days
he
is
accustomed
to
doing
himself
extremely
well
in
proportion
to
his
resources
whether
they
be
great
or
small
and
the
comforts
as
also
the
luxuries
he
allows
himself
and
his
domestic
appendages
are
in
a
proportion
much
higher
in
its
relation
to
these
resources
than
it
would
be
were
he
english
french
german
or
italians
as
a
consequence
he
expects
when
he
goes
forth
whether
or
on
business
that
his
hostelry
shall
surround
him
either
with
holiday
luxuries
and
gaiety
or
with
such
lavishness
of
comfort
as
shall
alleviate
the
wear
and
tear
of
business
cares
and
fatigues
the
rich
man
demands
something
almost
as
good
as
he
has
left
at
home
the
man
of
moderate
means
something
much
better
certain
persons
given
to
regarding
public
wants
and
desires
as
foundations
for
the
fortune
of
business
schemes
having
discovered
this
the
enormous
and
sumptuous
hotel
evolved
itself
from
their
astute
knowledge
of
common
facts
at
the
entrances
of
these
hotels
omnibuses
and
cabs
laden
with
trunks
and
packages
frequently
bearing
labels
marked
with

letters

drew
up
and
deposited
their
contents
and
burdens
at
regular
intervals
then
men
with
keen
and
often
humorous
faces
or
almost
painfully
anxious
ones
their
exceedingly
wives
and
more
or
less
attractive
and
daughters
their
eager
little
girls
and
little
boys
passed
through
the
corridors
in
flocks
and
took
possession
of
suites
of
rooms
sometimes
for
hours
sometimes
for
six
weeks
the
worthingtons
took
possession
of
such
a
suite
in
such
a
hotel
bettina
vanderpoel
apartments
faced
the
embankment
from
her
windows
she
could
look
out
at
the
broad
splendid
muddy
thames
slowly
rolling
in
its
grave
stately
way
beneath
its
bridges
bearing
with
it
heavy
lumbering
barges
excited
tooting
little
penny
steamers
and
craft
of
various
shapes
and
sizes
the
errand
or
burden
of
each
meaning
a
different
story
it
had
been
to
bettina
one
of
her
pleasures
of
the
finest
epicurean
flavour
to
reflect
that
she
had
never
had
any
brief
and
superficial
knowledge
of
england
as
she
had
never
been
to
the
country
at
all
in
those
earlier
years
when
her
knowledge
of
places
must
necessarily
have
been
always
the
incomplete
one
of
either
a
schoolgirl
traveller
or
a
schoolgirl
resident
whose
views
were
limited
by
the
walls
of
restriction
built
around
her
if
relations
of
the
usual
ease
and
friendliness
had
existed
between
lady
anstruthers
and
her
family
bettina
would
doubtless
have
known
her
sister
adopted
country
well
it
would
have
been
a
thing
so
natural
as
to
be
almost
inevitable
that
she
would
have
crossed
the
channel
to
spend
her
holidays
at
stornham
as
matters
had
stood
however
the
child
herself
in
the
days
when
she
had
been
a
child
had
had
most
definite
private
views
on
the
subject
of
visits
to
england
she
had
made
up
her
young
mind
absolutely
that
she
would
not
if
it
were
decently
possible
to
avoid
it
set
her
foot
upon
english
soil
until
she
was
old
enough
and
strong
enough
to
carry
out
what
had
been
at
first
her
passionately
romantic
plans
for
discovering
and
facing
the
truth
of
the
reason
for
the
apparent
change
in
rosy
when
she
went
to
england
she
would
go
to
rosy
as
she
had
grown
older
having
in
the
course
of
education
and
travel
seen
most
continental
countries
she
had
liked
to
think
that
she
had
saved
put
aside
for
less
hasty
consumption
and
more
delicate
appreciation
of
flavours
as
it
were
the
country
she
was
conscious
she
cared
for
most
it
is
england
we
love
we
americans
she
had
said
to
her
father
what
could
be
more
natural
we
belong
to
it
it
belongs
to
us
i
could
never
be
convinced
that
the
old
tie
of
blood
does
not
count
all
nationalities
have
come
to
us
since
we
became
a
nation
but
most
of
us
in
the
beginning
came
from
england
we
are
touching
about
it
too
we
trifle
with
france
and
labour
with
germany
we
sentimentalise
over
italy
and
ecstacise
over
spain
but
england
we
love
how
it
moves
us
when
we
go
to
it
how
we
gush
if
we
are
simple
and
effusive
how
we
are
stirred
imaginatively
if
we
are
of
the
perceptive
class
i
have
heard
the
commonest
little
woman
say
the
prettiest
clumsy
emotional
things
about
what
she
has
seen
there
a
new
england
who
has
made
a
cook
tour
will
almost
have
tears
in
her
voice
as
she
wanders
on
with
her
commonplaces
about
hawthorn
hedges
and
thatched
cottages
and
white
or
red
farms
why
are
we
not
unconsciously
pathetic
about
german
cottages
and
italian
villas
because
we
have
not
in
centuries
past
had
the
habit
of
being
born
in
them
it
is
only
an
english
cottage
and
an
english
lane
whether
white
with
hawthorn
blossoms
or
bare
with
winter
that
wakes
in
us
that
little
yearning
grovelling
tenderness
that
is
so
sweet
it
is
only
nature
calling
us
worthington
came
in
during
the
course
of
the
morning
to
find
her
standing
before
her
window
looking
out
at
the
thames
the
embankment
the
hansom
cabs
themselves
with
an
absolutely
serious
absorption
this
changed
to
a
smile
as
she
turned
to
greet
her
i
am
delighted
she
said
i
could
scarcely
tell
you
how
much
the
impression
is
all
new
and
i
am
excited
a
little
by
everything
i
am
so
intensely
glad
that
i
have
saved
it
so
long
and
that
i
have
known
it
only
as
part
of
literature
i
am
even
charmed
that
it
rains
and
that
the
cabmen
mackintoshes
are
shining
and
she
drew
forward
a
chair
and
worthington
sat
down
looking
at
her
with
involuntary
admiration
you
look
as
if
you
were
delighted
she
said
your
eyes
you
have
amazing
eyes
betty
i
am
trying
to
picture
to
myself
what
lady
anstruthers
will
feel
when
she
sees
you
what
were
you
like
when
she
married
bettina
sat
down
smiling
and
looking
indeed
quite
incredibly
lovely
she
was
capable
of
a
warmth
and
a
sweetness
which
were
as
embracing
as
other
qualities
she
possessed
were
powerful
i
was
eight
years
old
she
said
i
was
a
rude
little
girl
with
long
legs
and
a
high
determined
voice
i
know
i
was
rude
i
remember
answering
i
seem
to
have
heard
that
you
did
not
like
your
and
that
you
were
opposed
to
the
imagine
the
undisciplined
audacity
of
a
child
of
eight
the
marriage
of
her
sister
i
was
quite
capable
of
it
you
see
in
those
days
we
had
not
been
trained
at
all
one
had
only
been
allowed
tremendous
liberty
and
interfered
conversationally
with
one
elders
and
betters
at
any
moment
i
was
an
american
little
girl
and
american
little
girls
were
really
they
really
were
with
a
laugh
whose
musical
sound
was
after
all
wholly
you
did
not
treat
sir
nigel
anstruthers
as
one
of
your
he
was
one
of
my
elders
at
all
events
and
becomingness
of
bearing
should
have
taught
me
to
hold
my
little
tongue
i
am
giving
some
thought
now
to
the
kind
of
thing
i
must
invent
as
a
suitable
apology
when
i
find
him
a
really
delightful
person
full
of
virtues
and
accomplishments
perhaps
he
has
a
horror
of
i
should
like
to
be
present
at
your
first
meeting
worthington
reflected
you
are
going
down
to
stornham
that
is
my
plan
when
i
write
to
you
on
my
arrival
i
will
tell
you
if
i
encountered
the
then
with
a
swift
change
of
subject
and
a
lifting
of
her
slender
velvet
line
of
eyebrow
i
am
only
deploring
that
i
have
not
time
to
visit
the
worthington
was
betrayed
into
a
momentary
glance
of
uncertainty
almost
verging
in
its
significance
on
a
gasp
the
tower
of
london
dear
betty
bettina
laugh
was
mellow
with
revelation
ah
she
said
you
do
know
my
point
of
view
it
plain
enough
you
see
when
i
delight
in
these
things
i
think
i
delight
most
in
my
delight
in
them
it
means
that
i
am
almost
having
the
kind
of
feeling
the
fresh
american
souls
had
who
landed
here
thirty
years
ago
and
revelled
in
the
resemblance
to
dickens
characters
they
met
with
in
the
streets
and
were
historically
thrilled
by
the
places
where
heads
were
chopped
off
imagine
their
reflections
on
charles
when
they
stood
in
whitehall
gazing
on
the
very
spot
where
that
poor
last
word
was
uttered
and
think
of
their
joy
when
each
crossing
sweeper
they
gave
disproportionate
largess
to
seemed
joe
all
alones
in
the
slightest
you
do
mean
to
say
worthington
was
vaguely
awakening
to
the
situation
that
the
charm
of
my
visit
to
myself
is
that
i
realise
that
i
am
rather
like
that
i
have
positively
preserved
something
because
i
have
kept
away
you
have
been
here
so
often
and
know
things
so
well
and
you
were
even
so
sophisticated
when
you
began
that
you
have
never
really
had
the
flavours
and
emotions
i
am
sophisticated
too
sophisticated
enough
to
have
cherished
my
flavours
as
a
gourmet
tries
to
save
the
bouquet
of
old
wine
you
think
that
the
tower
is
the
pleasure
of
housemaids
on
a
bank
holiday
but
it
quite
makes
me
quiver
to
think
of
it
laughing
again
that
i
laugh
is
the
sign
that
i
am
not
as
beautifully
freshly
capable
of
enjoyment
as
those
genuine
first
americans
were
and
in
a
way
i
am
sorry
for
worthington
laughed
also
and
with
an
enjoyment
you
are
very
clever
betty
she
said
no
no
answered
bettina
or
if
i
am
almost
everybody
is
clever
in
these
days
we
are
nearly
all
of
us
comparatively
you
are
very
interesting
at
all
events
and
the
anstruthers
will
exult
in
you
if
they
are
dull
in
the
country
you
will
save
i
am
very
interested
at
all
events
said
bettina
and
interest
like
mine
is
quite
passe
a
clever
american
who
lives
in
england
and
is
the
pet
of
duchesses
once
said
to
me
he
always
speaks
of
americans
as
if
they
were
a
distant
and
recently
discovered
species
they
first
came
over
they
were
a
novelty
their
enthusiasm
amused
people
but
now
you
see
it
has
become
vieux
jeu
young
women
whose
specialty
was
to
be
excited
by
the
tower
of
london
and
westminster
abbey
are
not
novelties
any
longer
in
fact
it
been
done
and
it
done
for
as
a
specialty
and
i
am
excited
about
the
tower
of
london
i
may
be
able
to
restrain
my
feelings
at
the
sight
of
the
beef
eaters
but
they
will
upset
me
a
little
and
i
must
brace
myself
i
must
truly
betty
said
worthington
regarding
her
with
curiosity
arising
from
a
faint
doubt
of
her
entire
seriousness
mingled
with
a
fainter
doubt
of
her
entire
levity
betty
flung
out
her
hands
in
a
slight
but
very
gesture
and
shook
her
head
ah
she
said
it
was
all
true
you
know
they
were
all
horribly
real
the
things
that
were
shuddered
over
and
sentimentalised
about
sophistication
combined
with
imagination
makes
them
materialise
again
to
me
at
least
now
i
am
here
the
gulf
between
a
historical
figure
and
a
man
or
woman
who
could
bleed
and
cry
out
in
human
words
was
broad
when
one
was
at
school
lady
jane
grey
for
instance
how
nebulous
she
was
and
how
little
one
cared
she
seemed
invented
merely
to
add
a
detail
to
one
lesson
in
english
history
but
as
we
drove
across
waterloo
bridge
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
tower
and
what
do
you
suppose
i
began
to
think
of
it
was
monstrous
i
saw
a
door
in
the
tower
and
the
stone
steps
and
the
square
space
and
in
the
chill
clear
early
morning
a
little
slender
helpless
girl
led
out
a
little
fair
real
thing
like
rosy
all
alone
everyone
she
belonged
to
far
away
not
a
man
near
who
dared
utter
a
word
of
pity
when
she
turned
her
awful
meek
young
desperate
eyes
upon
him
she
was
a
pious
child
and
no
doubt
she
lifted
her
eyes
to
the
sky
i
wonder
if
it
was
blue
and
its
blueness
broke
her
heart
because
it
looked
as
if
it
might
have
pitied
such
a
young
patient
girl
thing
led
out
in
the
fair
morning
to
walk
to
the
hacked
block
and
give
her
trembling
pardon
to
the
man
with
the
axe
and
then
her
soul
to
god
to
stretch
her
sweet
slim
neck
out
upon
oh
betty
dear
worthington
expostulated
bettina
sprang
to
her
and
took
her
hand
in
pretty
appeal
i
beg
pardon
i
beg
pardon
i
really
do
she
exclaimed
i
did
not
intend
deliberately
to
be
painful
but
that
beneath
the
sophistication
is
something
of
what
i
bring
to
chapter
x
is
lady
anstruthers
at
home
all
that
she
had
brought
with
her
to
england
combined
with
what
she
had
called
sophistication
but
which
was
rather
her
exquisite
appreciation
of
values
and
effects
she
took
with
her
when
she
went
the
next
day
to
charing
cross
station
and
arranged
herself
at
her
ease
in
the
railway
carriage
while
her
maid
bought
their
tickets
for
stornham
what
the
people
in
the
station
saw
the
guards
and
porters
the
men
in
the
book
stalls
the
travellers
hurrying
past
was
a
girl
whose
colouring
and
carriage
made
one
turn
to
glance
after
her
and
who
having
bought
some
periodicals
and
papers
took
her
place
in
a
compartment
and
watched
the
passersby
interestedly
through
the
open
window
having
been
looked
at
and
remarked
on
during
her
whole
life
bettina
did
not
find
it
disturbing
that
more
than
one
porter
and
elderly
gentleman
or
freshly
attired
young
one
having
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
through
her
window
made
it
convenient
to
saunter
past
or
hover
round
she
looked
at
them
much
more
frankly
than
they
looked
at
her
to
her
they
were
all
specimens
of
the
types
she
was
at
present
interested
in
for
practical
reasons
she
was
summing
up
english
character
with
more
deliberate
intention
than
she
had
felt
in
the
years
when
she
had
gradually
learned
to
know
continental
types
and
differentiate
such
peculiarities
as
were
significant
of
their
ranks
and
nations
as
the
first
reuben
vanderpoel
had
studied
the
countenances
and
indicative
methods
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
new
parts
of
the
country
in
which
it
was
his
intention
to
do
business
so
the
modernity
of
his
descendant
applied
itself
to
observation
for
reasons
parallel
in
nature
though
not
in
actual
kind
as
he
had
brought
beads
and
firewater
to
bear
as
agents
upon
savages
who
would
barter
for
them
skins
and
products
which
might
be
turned
into
money
so
she
brought
her
beauty
steadfastness
of
purpose
and
alertness
of
brain
to
bear
upon
the
matter
the
practical
dealing
with
which
was
the
end
she
held
in
view
to
bear
herself
in
this
matter
with
as
practical
a
control
of
situations
as
that
with
which
her
would
have
borne
himself
in
making
a
trade
with
a
previously
unknown
tribe
of
indians
was
quite
her
intention
though
it
had
not
occurred
to
her
to
put
it
to
herself
in
any
such
form
still
whether
she
was
aware
of
the
fact
or
not
her
point
of
view
was
exactly
what
the
first
reuben
vanderpoel
had
been
on
many
very
different
occasions
she
had
before
her
the
task
of
dealing
with
facts
and
factors
of
which
at
present
she
knew
but
little
astuteness
of
perception
and
adaptability
were
her
chief
resources
she
was
ready
either
for
calm
bold
approach
or
equally
calm
and
wholly
retreat
the
perceptions
she
had
brought
with
her
filled
her
journey
into
kent
with
delicious
things
delicious
recognition
of
beauties
she
had
before
known
the
existence
of
only
through
the
reading
of
books
and
the
dwelling
upon
their
charms
as
reproduced
more
or
less
perfectly
on
canvas
she
saw
roll
by
her
with
the
passing
of
the
train
the
loveliness
of
land
and
picturesqueness
of
living
which
she
had
saved
for
herself
with
epicurean
intention
for
years
her
fancy
when
detached
from
her
thoughts
of
her
sister
had
been
epicurean
and
she
had
been
quite
aware
that
it
was
so
when
she
had
left
the
suburbs
and
those
villages
already
touched
with
suburbanity
behind
she
felt
herself
settle
into
a
glow
of
luxurious
enjoyment
in
the
freshness
of
her
pleasure
in
the
familiar
and
yet
unfamiliar
objects
in
the
fields
whose
oaks
and
beeches
were
more
embowering
in
their
shade
and
sweeter
in
their
green
than
anything
she
remembered
that
other
countries
had
offered
her
even
at
their
best
within
the
fields
the
hawthorn
hedges
beautifully
enclosed
were
groups
of
resigned
mother
sheep
with
their
young
lambs
about
them
the
curious
pointed
tops
of
the
red
hopkilns
piercing
the
trees
near
the
farmhouses
wore
an
almost
intentional
air
of
adding
picturesque
detail
there
were
clusters
of
old
buildings
and
dots
of
cottages
and
cottage
gardens
which
made
her
now
and
then
utter
exclamations
of
delight
little
inarticulate
rosy
had
seen
and
felt
it
all
twelve
years
before
on
her
hopeless
bridal
when
nigel
had
sat
huddled
unbecomingly
in
the
corner
of
the
railway
carriage
her
power
of
expression
had
been
limited
to
little
joyful
gasps
and
obvious
laudatory
adjectives
smothered
in
their
birth
by
her
first
glance
at
her
bridegroom
betty
in
seeing
it
knew
all
the
exquisiteness
of
her
own
pleasure
and
all
the
meanings
of
it
yes
it
was
england
england
it
was
the
england
of
constable
and
morland
of
miss
mitford
and
miss
austen
the
brontes
and
george
eliot
the
land
which
softly
rolled
and
clothed
itself
in
the
rich
verdure
of
many
trees
sometimes
in
lovely
clusters
sometimes
in
covering
copse
was
constable
the
ripe
young
woman
with
the
children
and
the
farmyard
beasts
about
her
as
she
fed
the
hens
from
the
wooden
piggin
under
her
arm
was

the
village
street
might
be
miss
mitford
the
house
jane
austen
own
fancy
in
its
warm
brick
and
comfortable
decorum
she
laughed
a
little
as
she
thought
it
that
is
american
she
said
the
habit
of
comparing
every
stick
and
stone
and
breathing
thing
to
some
literary
parallel
we
almost
invariably
say
that
things
remind
us
of
pictures
or
books
most
usually
books
it
seems
a
little
crude
but
perhaps
it
means
that
we
are
an
intensely
literary
and
artistic
she
continued
to
find
comparisons
revealing
to
her
their
appositeness
until
her
journey
had
ended
by
the
train
slackening
speed
and
coming
to
a
standstill
before
the
little
station
which
had
presented
its
quaint
aspect
to
lady
anstruthers
on
her
of
years
before
it
had
not
during
the
years
which
certainly
had
given
time
for
change
altered
in
the
least
the
station
master
had
grown
stouter
and
more
rosy
and
came
forward
with
his
respectful
hospitable
air
to
attend
to
the
young
lady
who
was
the
only
passenger
he
thought
she
must
be
a
visitor
expected
at
some
country
house
but
none
of
the
carriages
whose
coachmen
were
his
familiar
acquaintances
were
in
waiting
that
such
a
fine
young
lady
should
be
paying
a
visit
at
any
house
whose
owners
did
not
send
an
equipage
to
attend
her
coming
struck
him
as
unusual
the
brougham
from
the
crown
though
a
decent
country
town
vehicle
seemed
inadequate
yet
there
it
stood
drawn
up
outside
the
station
and
she
went
to
it
with
the
manner
of
a
young
lady
who
had
ordered
its
attendance
and
knew
it
would
be
there
wells
felt
a
good
deal
of
interest
among
the
many
young
ladies
who
descended
from
the
compartments
and
passed
through
the
little
on
their
way
to
the
carriages
of
the
gentry
they
were
going
to
visit
he
did
not
know
when
a
young
lady
had
caught
his
eye
so
to
speak
as
this
one
did
she
was
not
exactly
the
kind
of
young
lady
one
would
immediately
class
mentally
as
a
foreigner
but
the
blue
of
her
eyes
was
so
deep
and
her
hair
and
eyelashes
so
dark
that
these
things
combining
themselves
with
a
certain
way
she
had
made
him
feel
her
to
be
of
a
type
unfamiliar
to
the
region
at
least
he
was
struck
also
by
the
fact
that
the
young
lady
had
no
maid
with
her
the
truth
was
that
bettina
had
purposely
left
her
maid
in
town
if
awkward
things
occurred
the
presence
of
an
attendant
would
be
a
sort
of
complication
it
was
better
on
the
first
approach
to
be
wholly
unencumbered
how
far
are
we
from
stornham
court
she
inquired
five
miles
my
lady
he
answered
touching
his
cap
she
expressed
something
which
to
the
rural
and
ingenuous
whose
standards
were
defined
demanded
a
recognition
of
probable
rank
i
like
to
know
was
his
comment
to
his
wife
when
he
went
home
to
dinner
who
has
gone
to
stornham
court
there
few
enough
visitors
go
there
and
none
such
as
her
for
certain
she
do
live
anywhere
on
the
line
above
here
either
for
i
never
seen
her
face
before
she
was
a
tall
handsome
one
she
was
but
it
is
just
that
made
you
look
after
her
she
was
a
clever
one
with
a
spirit
i
be
bound
i
was
wondering
what
her
ladyship
would
have
to
say
to
perhaps
she
was
one
of
his
fine
ladies
suggestively
that
she
was
either
and
as
for
that
i
wonder
what
he
have
to
say
to
such
as
she
there
was
complexity
of
element
enough
in
the
thing
she
was
on
her
way
to
do
bettina
was
thinking
as
she
was
driven
over
the
white
ribbon
of
country
road
that
unrolled
over
rise
and
hollow
between
the
greenness
of
fields
and
the
scented
hedges
the
soft
beauty
enclosing
her
was
a
little
shut
out
from
her
by
her
mental
attitude
she
brought
forward
for
her
own
decisions
upon
suitable
action
a
number
of
possible
situations
she
might
find
herself
called
upon
to
confront
the
one
thing
necessary
was
that
she
should
be
prepared
for
anything
whatever
even
for
rosy
not
being
pleased
to
see
her
or
for
finding
sir
nigel
a
thoroughly
reformed
and
amiable
character
it
is
the
thing
which
seemingly
can
not
happen
which
one
is
most
likely
to
find
one
self
face
to
face
with
it
will
be
a
little
awkward
to
arrange
if
he
has
developed
every
domestic
virtue
and
is
delighted
to
see
under
such
rather
confusing
conditions
her
plan
would
be
to
present
to
them
as
an
affectionate
surprise
the
unheralded
visit
which
might
appear
a
trifle
uncalled
for
she
felt
happily
sure
of
herself
under
any
circumstances
not
partaking
of
the
nature
of
collisions
at
sea
yet
she
had
not
behaved
absolutely
ill
at
the
time
of
the
threatened
catastrophe
in
the
meridiana
her
remembrance
an
oddly
sudden
one
of
the
definite
manner
of
the
passenger
assured
her
of
that
he
had
certainly
had
all
his
senses
about
him
and
he
had
spoken
to
her
as
a
person
to
be
counted
on
her
pulse
beat
a
little
more
hurriedly
as
the
brougham
entered
stornham
village
it
was
picturesque
but
struck
her
as
looking
neglected
many
of
the
cottages
had
an
air
of
dilapidation
there
were
many
broken
windows
and
unmended
garden
palings
a
suggested
lack
of
whitewash
in
several
cases
was
not
cheerful
i
know
nothing
of
the
duties
of
english
landlords
she
said
looking
through
her
carriage
window
but
i
should
do
it
myself
if
i
were
she
saw
as
she
was
taken
through
the
park
gateway
that
that
structure
was
out
of
order
and
that
damaged
diamond
panes
peered
out
from
under
the
thickness
of
the
ivy
massing
itself
over
the
lodge
ah
was
her
thought
it
does
not
promise
as
it
should
happy
people
do
not
let
things
fall
to
even
winding
avenue
and
spreading
sward
and
gorse
and
broom
and
bracken
enfolding
all
the
earth
beneath
huge
trees
were
not
fair
enough
to
remove
a
sudden
remote
fear
which
arose
in
her
rapidly
reasoning
mind
it
suggested
to
her
a
point
of
view
so
new
that
while
she
was
amazed
at
herself
for
not
having
contemplated
it
before
she
found
herself
wishing
that
the
coachman
would
drive
rather
more
slowly
actually
that
she
might
have
more
time
to
reflect
they
were
nearing
a
dip
in
the
park
where
there
was
a
lonely
looking
pool
the
bracken
was
thick
and
high
there
and
the
sun
which
had
just
broken
through
a
cloud
had
pierced
the
trees
with
a
golden
gleam
a
little
withdrawn
from
this
shaft
of
brightness
stood
two
figures
a
dowdy
little
woman
and
a
hunchbacked
boy
the
woman
held
some
ferns
in
her
hand
and
the
boy
was
sitting
down
and
resting
his
chin
on
his
hands
which
were
folded
on
the
top
of
a
stick
stop
here
for
a
moment
bettina
said
to
the
coachman
i
want
to
ask
that
woman
a
she
had
thought
that
she
might
discover
if
her
sister
was
at
the
court
she
realised
that
to
know
would
be
a
point
of
advantage
she
leaned
forward
and
spoke
i
beg
your
pardon
she
said
i
wonder
if
you
can
tell
me
the
woman
came
forward
a
little
she
had
a
listless
step
and
a
faded
listless
face
what
did
you
ask
she
said
betty
leaned
still
further
forward
can
you
tell
me
she
began
and
stopped
a
sense
of
stricture
in
the
throat
stopped
her
as
her
eyes
took
in
the
colour
of
the
thin
face
the
colour
of
the
thin
hair
thin
drab
hair
dragged
in
straight
hard
unbecomingness
from
the
forehead
and
cheeks
was
it
true
that
her
heart
was
thumping
as
she
had
heard
it
said
that
agitation
made
hearts
thump
she
began
again
can
you
tell
me
if
lady
anstruthers
is
at
home
she
inquired
as
she
said
it
she
felt
the
blood
surge
up
from
the
furious
heart
and
the
hand
she
had
laid
on
the
handle
of
the
door
of
the
brougham
clutched
it
involuntarily
the
dowdy
little
woman
answered
her
indifferently
staring
at
her
a
little
i
am
lady
anstruthers
she
said
bettina
opened
the
carriage
door
and
stood
upon
the
ground
go
on
to
the
house
she
gave
order
to
the
coachman
and
with
a
somewhat
startled
look
he
drove
away
rosy
bettina
voice
was
a
hushed
almost
awed
thing
you
are
rosy
the
faded
little
wreck
of
a
creature
began
to
look
frightened
rosy
she
repeated
with
a
small
wry
painful
smile
she
was
the
next
moment
held
in
the
folding
of
strong
young
arms
against
a
quickly
beating
heart
she
was
being
wildly
kissed
and
the
very
air
seemed
rich
with
warmth
and
life
i
am
betty
she
heard
look
at
me
rosy
i
am
betty
look
at
me
and
remember
lady
anstruthers
gasped
and
broke
into
a
faint
hysteric
laugh
she
suddenly
clutched
at
bettina
arm
for
a
minute
her
gaze
was
wild
as
she
looked
up
betty
she
cried
out
no
no
no
i
ca
believe
it
i
ca
i
ca
that
just
this
thing
could
have
taken
place
in
her
bettina
had
never
thought
as
she
had
reflected
on
her
way
from
the
station
the
impossible
is
what
one
finds
one
self
face
to
face
with
twelve
years
should
not
have
changed
a
pretty
blonde
thing
of
nineteen
to
a
worn
dowdy
of
the
order
of
dowdiness
which
seems
to
have
lived
beyond
age
and
sex
she
looked
even
stupid
or
at
least
stupefied
at
this
moment
she
was
a
silly
woman
who
did
not
know
what
to
do
for
a
few
seconds
bettina
wondered
if
she
was
glad
to
see
her
or
only
felt
awkward
and
unequal
to
the
situation
i
ca
believe
you
she
cried
out
again
and
began
to
shiver
betty
little
betty
no
no
it
is
she
turned
to
the
boy
who
had
lifted
his
chin
from
his
stick
and
was
staring
ughtred
ughtred
she
called
to
him
come
she
says
she
says
she
sat
down
upon
a
clump
of
heather
and
began
to
cry
she
hid
her
face
in
her
spare
hands
and
broke
into
sobbing
oh
betty
no
she
gasped
it
so
long
ago
it
so
far
away
you
never
came
no
one
no
one
came
the
hunchbacked
boy
drew
near
he
had
limped
up
on
his
stick
he
spoke
like
an
elderly
affectionate
gnome
not
like
a
child
do
do
that
mother
he
said
do
let
it
upset
you
so
whatever
it
it
so
long
ago
it
so
far
away
she
wept
with
catches
in
her
breath
and
voice
you
never
came
betty
knelt
down
and
enfolded
her
again
her
voice
was
firm
and
clear
i
have
come
now
she
said
and
it
is
not
far
away
a
cable
will
reach
father
in
two
pursuing
a
certain
vivid
thought
in
her
mind
she
looked
at
her
watch
if
you
spoke
to
mother
by
cable
this
moment
she
added
with
accustomed
coolness
and
she
felt
her
sister
actually
start
as
she
spoke
she
could
answer
you
by
five
lady
anstruther
start
ended
in
a
laugh
and
gasp
more
hysteric
than
her
first
there
was
even
a
kind
of
wan
awakening
in
her
face
as
she
lifted
it
to
look
at
the
wonderful
newcomer
she
caught
her
hand
and
held
it
trembling
as
she
weakly
laughed
it
must
be
betty
she
cried
that
little
stern
way
it
is
so
like
her
betty
betty
dear
she
fell
into
a
sobbing
shaken
heap
upon
the
heather
the
harrowing
thought
passed
through
betty
mind
that
she
looked
almost
like
a
limp
bundle
of
shabby
clothes
she
was
so
helpless
in
her
pathetic
apologetic
hysteria
i
shall
be
better
she
gasped
it
nothing
ughtred
tell
she
very
weak
really
said
the
boy
ughtred
in
his
mature
way
she
ca
help
it
sometimes
i
get
some
water
from
the
let
me
go
said
betty
and
she
darted
down
to
the
water
she
was
back
in
a
moment
the
boy
was
rubbing
and
patting
his
mother
hands
tenderly
at
any
rate
he
remarked
as
one
consoled
by
a
reflection
father
is
not
at
chapter
xi
i
thought
you
had
all
as
after
a
singular
half
hour
spent
among
the
bracken
under
the
trees
they
began
their
return
to
the
house
bettina
felt
that
her
sense
of
adventure
had
altered
its
character
she
was
still
in
the
midst
of
a
remarkable
sort
of
exploit
which
might
end
anywhere
or
in
anything
but
it
had
become
at
once
more
prosaic
in
detail
and
more
intense
in
its
significance
what
its
significance
might
prove
likely
to
be
when
she
faced
it
she
had
not
known
it
is
true
but
this
was
different
from
from
anything
as
they
walked
up
the
avenue
she
kept
glancing
aside
at
rosy
and
endeavouring
to
draw
useful
conclusions
the
poor
girl
air
of
being
a
plain
insignificant
frump
long
past
youth
struck
an
extraordinary
and
for
the
time
unexplainable
note
her
dress
the
cheap
suit
of
the
hunchbacked
boy
who
limped
patiently
along
helped
by
his
crutch
suggested
possible
explanations
which
were
without
doubt
connected
with
the
thought
which
had
risen
in
bettina
mind
as
she
had
been
driven
through
the
entrance
gate
what
extraordinary
disposal
was
being
made
of
rosy
money
but
her
each
glance
at
her
sister
also
suggested
complication
upon
complication
the
singular
half
hour
under
the
trees
by
the
pool
spent
after
the
first
hysteric
moments
were
over
in
vague
exclaimings
and
questions
which
seemed
half
frightened
and
all
at
sea
had
gradually
shown
her
that
she
was
talking
to
a
creature
wholly
other
than
the
rosalie
who
had
so
well
known
and
loved
them
all
and
whom
they
had
so
well
loved
and
known
they
did
not
know
this
one
and
she
did
not
know
them
she
was
even
a
little
afraid
of
the
stir
and
movement
of
their
life
and
being
the
rosy
they
had
known
seemed
to
be
imprisoned
within
the
wall
the
years
of
her
separated
life
had
built
about
her
at
each
breath
she
drew
bettina
saw
how
long
the
years
had
been
to
her
and
how
far
her
home
had
seemed
to
lie
away
so
far
that
it
could
not
touch
her
and
was
only
a
sort
of
dream
the
recalling
of
which
made
her
suddenly
begin
to
cry
again
every
few
minutes
to
bettina
sensitively
alert
mind
it
was
plain
that
it
would
not
do
in
the
least
to
drag
her
suddenly
out
of
her
prison
or
cloister
whichsoever
it
might
be
to
do
so
would
be
like
forcing
a
creature
accustomed
only
to
darkness
to
stare
at
the
blazing
sun
to
have
burst
upon
her
with
the
old
impetuous
candid
fondness
would
have
been
to
frighten
and
shock
her
as
if
with
something
bordering
on
indecency
she
could
not
have
stood
it
perhaps
such
fondness
was
so
remote
from
her
in
these
days
that
she
had
even
ceased
to
be
able
to
understand
it
where
are
your
little
girls
bettina
asked
remembering
that
there
had
been
notice
given
of
the
advent
of
two
girl
babies
they
died
lady
anstruthers
answered
unemotionally
they
both
died
before
they
were
a
year
old
there
is
only
betty
glanced
at
the
boy
and
saw
a
small
flame
of
red
creep
up
on
his
cheek
instinctively
she
knew
what
it
meant
and
she
put
out
her
hand
and
lightly
touched
his
shoulder
i
hope
you
like
me
ughtred
she
said
he
almost
started
at
the
sound
of
her
voice
but
when
he
turned
his
face
towards
her
he
only
grew
redder
and
looked
awkward
without
answering
his
manner
was
that
of
a
boy
who
was
unused
to
the
amenities
of
polite
society
and
who
was
only
made
shy
by
them
without
warning
a
moment
or
so
later
bettina
stopped
in
the
middle
of
the
avenue
and
looked
up
at
the
arching
giant
branches
of
the
trees
which
had
reached
out
from
one
side
to
the
other
as
if
to
clasp
hands
or
encompass
an
interlacing
embrace
as
far
as
the
eye
reached
they
did
this
and
the
beholder
stood
as
in
a
high
stately
pergola
with
breaks
of
deep
azure
sky
between
several
mellow
cawing
rooks
were
floating
solemnly
beneath
or
above
the
branches
now
wand
then
settling
in
some
highest
one
or
disappearing
in
the
thick
greenness
lady
anstruthers
stopped
when
her
sister
did
so
and
glanced
at
her
in
vague
inquiry
it
was
plain
that
she
had
outlived
even
her
sense
of
the
beauty
surrounding
her
what
are
you
looking
at
betty
she
asked
at
all
of
it
betty
answered
it
is
so
she
likes
it
said
ughtred
and
then
rather
slunk
a
step
behind
his
mother
as
if
he
were
ashamed
of
himself
the
house
is
just
beyond
those
trees
said
lady
anstruthers
they
came
in
full
view
of
it
three
minutes
later
when
she
saw
it
betty
uttered
an
exclamation
and
stopped
again
to
enjoy
effects
she
likes
that
too
said
ughtred
and
although
he
said
it
sheepishly
there
was
imperfectly
concealed
beneath
the
awkwardness
a
pleasure
in
the
fact
do
you
asked
rosalie
with
her
small
painful
smile
betty
laughed
it
is
too
picturesque
in
its
special
way
to
be
quite
credible
she
said
i
thought
that
when
i
first
saw
it
said
rosy
do
you
think
so
now
well
was
the
rather
uncertain
reply
as
nigel
says
there
not
much
good
in
a
place
that
is
falling
to
why
let
it
fall
to
pieces
betty
put
it
to
her
with
impartial
promptness
we
have
money
enough
to
hold
it
together
resignedly
as
they
climbed
the
low
broad
steps
whose
broken
stone
balustrades
were
almost
hidden
in
clutching
untrimmed
ivy
betty
felt
them
to
be
almost
incredible
too
the
uneven
stones
of
the
terrace
the
steps
mounted
to
were
and
broken
also
tufts
of
green
growths
had
forced
themselves
between
the
flags
and
added
an
untidy
beauty
the
ivy
tossed
in
branches
over
the
red
roof
and
walls
of
the
house
it
had
been
left
unclipped
until
it
was
rather
an
endlessly
clambering
tree
than
a
creeper
the
hall
they
entered
had
the
beauty
of
spacious
form
and
good
old
oaken
panelling
there
were
deep
window
seats
and
an
ancient
settle
or
so
and
a
massive
table
by
the
fireless
hearth
but
there
were
no
pictures
in
places
where
pictures
had
evidently
once
hung
and
the
only
coverings
on
the
stone
floor
were
the
faded
remnants
of
a
central
rug
and
a
worn
tiger
skin
the
head
almost
bald
and
a
glass
eye
knocked
out
bettina
took
in
the
unpromising
details
without
a
quiver
of
the
extravagant
lashes
these
indeed
and
the
eyes
pertaining
to
them
seemed
rather
to
sweep
the
fine
roof
and
a
certain
minstrel
gallery
and
staircase
than
which
nothing
could
have
been
much
finer
with
the
look
of
an
appreciative
admirer
of
architectural
features
and
old
oak
she
had
not
journeyed
to
stornham
court
with
the
intention
of
disturbing
rosy
or
of
being
herself
obviously
disturbed
she
had
come
to
observe
situations
and
rearrange
them
with
that
intelligence
of
which
unconsidered
emotion
or
exclamation
form
no
part
it
is
the
first
old
english
house
i
have
seen
she
said
with
a
sigh
of
pleasure
i
am
so
glad
rosy
i
am
so
glad
that
it
is
she
put
a
hand
on
each
of
rosy
thin
shoulders
she
felt
sharply
defined
bones
as
she
did
so
and
bent
to
kiss
her
it
was
the
natural
affectionate
expression
of
her
feeling
but
tears
started
to
eyes
and
the
boy
ughtred
who
had
sat
down
in
a
window
seat
turned
red
again
and
shifted
in
his
place
oh
betty
was
rosy
faint
nervous
exclamation
you
seem
so
beautiful
and
so
so
strange
that
you
frighten
betty
laughed
with
the
softest
possible
cheerfulness
shaking
her
a
little
i
shall
not
seem
strange
long
she
said
after
i
have
stayed
with
you
a
few
weeks
if
you
will
let
me
stay
with
let
you
let
you
in
a
sort
of
gasp
poor
little
lady
anstruthers
sank
on
to
a
settle
and
began
to
cry
again
it
was
plain
that
she
always
cried
when
things
occurred
speech
from
his
window
seat
testified
at
once
to
that
do
cry
mother
he
said
you
know
how
we
talked
that
over
together
it
her
nerves
he
explained
to
bettina
we
know
it
only
makes
things
worse
but
she
ca
stop
bettina
sat
on
the
settle
too
she
herself
was
not
then
aware
of
the
wonderful
feeling
the
poor
little
spare
figure
experienced
as
her
softly
strong
young
arms
curved
about
it
she
was
only
aware
that
she
herself
felt
that
this
was
a
thing
and
that
she
must
not
must
not
let
it
be
seen
how
much
she
recognised
its
woefulness
this
was
pretty
fair
rosy
who
had
never
done
a
harm
in
her
happy
life
this
forlorn
thing
was
her
rosy
never
mind
she
said
half
laughing
again
i
rather
want
to
cry
myself
and
i
am
stronger
than
she
is
i
am
immensely
yes
yes
said
lady
anstruthers
wiping
her
eyes
and
making
a
tremendous
effort
at
composure
you
are
strong
i
have
grown
so
weak
in
well
in
every
way
betty
i
afraid
this
is
a
poor
welcome
you
see
i
afraid
you
find
it
all
so
different
from
from
new
i
wanted
to
find
it
different
said
betty
but
but
i
mean
you
know
lady
anstruthers
turned
helplessly
to
the
boy
bettina
was
struck
with
the
painful
truth
that
she
looked
even
silly
as
she
turned
to
him
ughtred
tell
her
she
ended
and
hung
her
head
ughtred
had
got
down
at
once
from
his
seat
and
limped
forward
his
unprepossessing
face
looked
as
if
he
pulled
his
childishness
together
with
an
unchildish
effort
she
means
he
said
in
his
awkward
way
that
she
does
know
how
to
make
you
comfortable
the
rooms
are
all
so
shabby
everything
is
so
shabby
perhaps
you
wo
stay
when
you
bettina
perceptibly
increased
the
firmness
of
her
hold
on
her
body
it
was
as
if
she
drew
it
nearer
to
her
side
in
a
kind
of
taking
possession
she
knew
that
the
moment
had
come
when
she
might
go
this
far
at
least
without
expressing
alarming
things
you
can
not
show
me
anything
that
will
frighten
me
was
the
answer
she
made
i
have
come
to
stay
rosy
we
can
make
things
right
if
they
require
it
why
not
lady
anstruthers
started
a
little
and
stared
at
her
she
knew
ten
thousand
reasons
why
things
had
not
been
made
right
and
the
casual
inference
that
such
reasons
could
be
lightly
swept
away
as
if
by
the
mere
wave
of
a
hand
implied
a
power
appertaining
to
a
time
seeming
so
lost
forever
that
it
was
too
much
for
her
oh
betty
betty
she
cried
you
talk
as
if
you
are
so
the
fact
so
simple
to
the
members
of
the
abnormal
class
to
which
she
of
a
truth
belonged
the
class
which
heaped
up
its
millions
the
absolute
knowledge
that
there
was
a
great
deal
of
money
in
the
world
and
that
she
was
of
those
who
were
among
its
chief
owners
had
ceased
to
seem
a
fact
and
had
vanished
into
the
region
of
fairy
stories
that
she
could
not
believe
it
a
reality
revealed
itself
to
bettina
as
by
a
flash
which
was
also
a
revelation
of
many
things
there
would
be
unpleasing
truths
to
be
learned
and
she
had
not
made
her
pilgrimage
for
nothing
but
in
any
event
there
were
advantages
without
doubt
in
the
circumstance
which
subjected
one
to
being
perpetually
pointed
out
as
a
daughter
of
a
as
this
argued
itself
out
for
her
with
rapid
lucidity
she
bent
and
kissed
rosy
once
more
she
even
tried
to
do
it
lightly
and
not
to
allow
the
rush
of
love
and
pity
in
her
soul
to
betray
her
i
talk
as
if
as
if
i
were
betty
she
said
you
have
forgotten
i
have
not
i
have
been
looking
forward
to
this
for
years
i
have
been
planning
to
come
to
you
since
i
was
eleven
years
old
and
here
we
you
did
forget
you
did
faltered
the
poor
wreck
of
rosy
oh
oh
i
thought
you
had
all
forgotten
me
quite
quite
and
her
face
went
down
in
her
spare
small
hands
and
she
began
to
cry
again
chapter
xii
ughtred
bettina
stood
alone
in
her
bedroom
a
couple
of
hours
later
lady
anstruthers
had
taken
her
to
it
preparing
her
for
its
limitations
by
explaining
that
she
would
find
it
quite
different
from
her
room
in
new
york
she
had
been
pathetically
nervous
and
flushed
about
it
and
bettina
had
also
been
aware
that
the
apartment
itself
had
been
hastily
and
with
much
moving
of
objects
from
one
chamber
to
another
made
ready
for
her
the
room
was
large
and
square
and
low
it
was
panelled
in
small
squares
of
white
wood
the
panels
were
old
enough
to
be
cracked
here
and
there
and
the
paint
was
stained
and
yellow
with
time
where
it
was
not
knocked
or
worn
off
there
was
a
small
paned
leaded
window
which
filled
a
large
part
of
one
side
of
the
room
and
its
deep
seat
was
an
agreeable
feature
sitting
in
it
one
looked
out
over
several
gardens
and
through
breaks
in
the
trees
of
the
park
to
a
fair
beyond
bettina
stood
before
this
window
for
a
few
moments
and
then
took
a
seat
in
the
embrasure
that
she
might
gaze
out
and
reflect
at
leisure
her
genius
as
has
before
been
mentioned
was
the
genius
for
living
for
being
vital
many
people
merely
exist
are
kept
alive
by
others
or
continue
to
vegetate
because
the
persistent
action
of
normal
functions
will
allow
of
their
doing
no
less
bettina
vanderpoel
had
lived
vividly
and
in
the
midst
of
a
atmosphere
of
action
from
her
first
hour
it
was
not
possible
for
her
to
be
one
of
the
horde
of
mere
spectators
wheresoever
she
moved
there
was
some
occult
stirring
of
the
mental
and
even
physical
air
her
pulses
beat
too
strongly
her
blood
ran
too
fast
to
allow
of
inaction
of
mind
or
body
when
in
passing
through
the
village
she
had
seen
the
broken
windows
and
the
hanging
palings
of
the
cottages
it
had
been
inevitable
that
at
once
she
should
in
thought
repair
them
set
them
straight
disorder
filled
her
with
a
sort
of
impatience
which
was
akin
to
physical
distress
if
she
had
been
born
a
poor
woman
she
would
have
worked
hard
for
her
living
and
found
an
interest
almost
an
exhilaration
in
her
labour
such
gifts
as
she
had
would
have
been
applied
to
the
tasks
she
undertook
it
had
frequently
given
her
pleasure
to
imagine
herself
earning
her
livelihood
as
a
seamstress
a
housemaid
a
nurse
she
knew
what
she
could
have
put
into
her
service
and
how
she
could
have
found
it
absorbing
imagination
and
initiative
could
make
any
service
absorbing
the
actual
truth
was
that
if
she
had
been
a
housemaid
the
room
she
set
in
order
would
have
taken
a
character
under
her
touch
if
she
had
been
a
seamstress
her
work
would
have
been
swiftly
done
her
imagination
would
have
invented
for
her
combinations
of
form
and
colour
if
she
had
been
a
nursemaid
the
children
under
her
care
would
never
have
been
sufficiently
bored
to
become
tiresome
or
intractable
and
they
also
would
have
gained
character
to
which
would
have
been
added
an
undeniable
vividness
of
outlook
she
could
not
have
left
them
alone
so
to
speak
in
obeying
the
mere
laws
of
her
being
she
would
have
stimulated
them
unconsciously
she
had
stimulated
her
fellow
pupils
at
school
when
she
was
his
companion
her
father
had
always
felt
himself
stirred
to
interest
and
enterprise
you
ought
to
have
been
a
man
betty
he
used
to
say
to
her
sometimes
but
betty
had
not
agreed
with
him
you
say
that
she
once
replied
to
him
because
you
see
i
am
inclined
to
do
things
to
change
them
if
they
need
changing
well
one
is
either
born
like
that
or
one
is
not
sometimes
i
think
that
perhaps
the
people
who
must
act
are
of
a
distinct
race
a
kind
of
vigorous
restlessness
drives
them
i
remember
that
when
i
was
a
child
i
could
not
see
a
pin
lying
upon
the
ground
without
picking
it
up
or
pass
a
drawer
which
needed
closing
without
giving
it
a
push
but
there
has
always
been
as
much
for
women
to
do
as
for
there
was
much
to
be
done
here
of
one
sort
of
thing
and
another
that
was
certain
as
she
gazed
through
the
small
panes
of
her
large
windows
she
found
herself
overlooking
part
of
a
wilderness
of
garden
which
revealed
itself
through
an
arch
in
an
overgrown
laurel
hedge
she
had
glimpses
of
unkempt
grass
paths
and
unclipped
topiary
work
which
had
lost
its
original
form
among
a
tangle
of
weeds
rose
the
heads
of
clumps
of
daffodils
stirred
by
a
passing
wind
of
spring
in
the
park
beyond
a
cuckoo
was
calling
she
was
conscious
both
of
the
forlorn
beauty
and
significance
of
the
neglected
garden
and
of
the
clear
quaintness
of
the
cuckoo
call
as
she
thought
of
other
things
her
spirit
and
her
health
are
broken
was
her
summing
up
her
prettiness
has
faded
to
a
rag
she
is
as
nervous
as
an
child
she
has
lost
her
wits
i
do
not
know
where
to
begin
with
her
i
must
let
her
tell
me
things
as
gradually
as
she
chooses
until
i
see
nigel
i
shall
not
know
what
his
method
with
her
has
been
she
looks
as
if
she
had
ceased
to
care
for
things
even
for
herself
what
shall
i
write
to
mother
she
knew
what
she
should
write
to
her
father
with
him
she
could
be
explicit
she
could
record
what
she
had
found
and
what
it
suggested
to
her
she
could
also
make
clear
her
reason
for
hesitance
and
deliberation
his
discretion
and
affection
would
comprehend
the
thing
which
she
herself
felt
and
which
affection
not
combined
with
discretion
might
not
take
in
he
would
understand
when
she
told
him
that
one
of
the
first
things
which
had
struck
her
had
been
that
rosy
herself
her
helplessness
and
timidity
might
for
a
period
at
least
form
obstacles
in
their
path
of
action
he
not
only
loved
rosy
but
realised
how
slight
a
sweet
thing
she
had
always
been
and
he
would
know
how
far
a
slight
creature
gentleness
might
be
overpowered
and
beaten
down
there
was
so
much
that
her
mother
must
be
spared
there
was
indeed
so
little
that
it
would
be
wise
to
tell
her
that
bettina
sat
gently
rubbing
her
forehead
as
she
thought
of
it
the
truth
was
that
she
must
tell
her
nothing
until
all
was
over
accomplished
decided
whatsoever
there
was
to
be
over
whatsoever
the
action
finally
taken
must
be
a
matter
lying
as
far
as
possible
between
her
father
and
herself
vanderpoel
trouble
would
be
too
keen
her
anxiety
too
great
to
keep
to
herself
even
if
she
were
not
overwhelmed
by
them
she
must
be
told
of
the
beauties
and
dimensions
of
stornham
all
relatable
details
of
life
must
be
generously
dwelt
on
above
all
rosy
must
be
made
to
write
letters
and
with
an
air
of
freedom
however
specious
a
knock
on
the
door
broke
the
thread
of
her
reflection
it
was
a
knock
and
she
answered
the
summons
herself
because
she
thought
it
might
be
rosy
it
was
not
lady
anstruthers
who
stood
outside
but
ughtred
who
balanced
himself
on
his
crutches
and
lifted
his
small
too
mature
face
may
i
come
in
he
asked
here
was
the
unexpected
again
but
she
did
not
allow
him
to
see
her
surprise
yes
she
said
certainly
you
he
swung
in
and
then
turned
to
speak
to
her
please
shut
the
door
and
lock
it
he
said
there
was
sudden
illumination
in
this
but
of
an
order
almost
whimsical
that
modern
people
in
modern
days
should
feel
bolts
and
bars
a
necessity
of
ordinary
intercourse
was
suggestive
she
was
plainly
about
to
receive
enlightenment
she
turned
the
key
and
followed
the
halting
figure
across
the
room
what
are
you
afraid
of
she
asked
when
mother
and
i
talk
things
over
he
said
we
always
do
it
where
no
one
can
see
or
hear
it
the
only
way
to
be
safe
from
what
his
eyes
fixed
themselves
on
her
as
he
answered
her
almost
sullenly
safe
from
people
who
might
listen
and
go
and
tell
that
we
had
been
in
his
odd
there
was
a
shade
of
appeal
not
wholly
hidden
by
his
evident
wish
not
to
be
boylike
betty
felt
a
desire
to
kneel
down
suddenly
and
embrace
him
but
she
knew
he
was
not
prepared
for
such
a
demonstration
he
looked
like
a
creature
who
had
lived
continually
at
bay
and
had
learned
to
adjust
himself
to
any
situation
with
caution
and
restraint
sit
down
ughtred
she
said
and
when
he
did
so
she
herself
sat
down
but
not
too
near
him
resting
his
chin
on
the
handle
of
a
crutch
he
gazed
at
her
almost
protestingly
i
always
have
to
do
these
things
he
said
and
i
am
not
clever
enough
or
old
enough
i
am
only
the
mention
of
the
number
of
his
years
was
plainly
not
apologetic
but
was
a
mere
statement
of
his
limitations
there
the
fact
was
and
he
must
make
the
best
of
it
he
could
what
things
do
you
mean
trying
to
make
things
easier
explaining
things
when
she
can
not
think
of
excuses
it
is
telling
you
what
she
is
too
frightened
to
tell
you
herself
i
said
to
her
that
you
must
be
told
it
made
her
nervous
and
miserable
but
i
knew
you
yes
i
must
betty
answered
i
am
glad
she
has
you
to
depend
on
his
crutch
grated
on
the
floor
and
his
boy
eyes
forbade
her
to
believe
that
their
sudden
lustre
was
in
any
way
connected
with
restrained
emotion
i
know
i
seem
queer
and
like
a
little
old
man
he
said
mother
cries
about
it
sometimes
but
it
ca
be
helped
it
is
because
she
has
never
had
anyone
but
me
to
help
her
when
i
was
very
little
i
found
out
how
frightened
and
miserable
she
was
after
his
rages
he
used
no
name
she
used
to
run
into
my
nursery
and
snatch
me
up
in
her
arms
and
hide
her
face
in
my
pinafore
sometimes
she
stuffed
it
into
her
mouth
and
bit
it
to
keep
herself
from
screaming
once
before
i
was
seven
i
ran
into
their
room
and
shouted
out
and
tried
to
fight
for
her
he
was
going
out
and
had
his
riding
whip
in
his
hand
and
he
caught
hold
of
me
and
struck
me
with
it
until
he
was
betty
stood
upright
what
what
what
she
cried
out
he
merely
nodded
his
head
shortly
she
saw
what
the
thing
had
been
by
the
way
his
face
lost
colour
of
course
he
said
it
was
because
i
was
impudent
and
needed
punishment
he
said
he
said
she
had
encouraged
me
in
american
impudence
it
was
worse
for
her
than
for
me
she
kneeled
down
and
screamed
out
as
if
she
was
crazy
that
she
would
give
him
what
he
wanted
if
he
would
wait
said
betty
drawing
in
her
breath
sharply
is
sir
nigel
and
he
wanted
he
nodded
again
tell
me
she
demanded
has
he
ever
struck
her
once
he
answered
slowly
before
i
was
born
he
struck
her
and
she
fell
against
something
that
is
why
i
am
like
and
he
touched
his
shoulder
the
feeling
which
surged
through
betty
vanderpoel
being
forced
her
to
go
and
stand
with
her
face
turned
towards
the
windows
her
hands
holding
each
other
tightly
behind
her
back
i
must
keep
still
she
said
i
must
make
myself
keep
she
spoke
unconsciously
half
aloud
and
ughtred
heard
her
and
replied
hurriedly
yes
he
said
you
must
make
yourself
keep
still
that
is
what
we
have
to
do
whatever
happens
that
is
one
of
the
things
mother
wanted
you
to
know
she
is
afraid
she
dare
let
you
she
turned
from
the
window
standing
at
her
full
height
and
looking
very
tall
for
a
girl
she
is
afraid
she
dare
see
that
will
come
to
an
end
now
there
are
things
which
can
be
he
flushed
nervously
that
is
what
she
was
afraid
you
would
say
he
spoke
fast
and
his
hands
trembled
she
is
nearly
wild
about
it
because
she
knows
he
will
try
to
do
something
that
will
make
you
feel
as
if
she
does
not
want
she
is
afraid
of
that
betty
exclaimed
he
do
it
he
do
it
if
you
did
not
know
oh
said
betty
with
unflinching
clearness
he
is
a
liar
is
he
the
helpless
rage
in
the
unchildish
eyes
the
shaking
voice
as
he
cried
out
in
answer
were
a
shock
it
was
as
if
he
wildly
rejoiced
that
she
had
spoken
the
word
yes
he
a
liar
a
liar
he
shrilled
he
a
liar
and
a
bully
and
a
coward
he
he
be
a
murderer
if
he
dared
but
he
and
his
face
dropped
on
his
arms
folded
on
his
crutch
and
he
broke
into
a
passion
of
crying
then
betty
knew
she
might
go
to
him
she
went
and
knelt
down
and
put
her
arm
round
him
ughtred
she
said
cry
if
you
like
i
should
do
it
if
i
were
you
but
i
tell
you
it
can
all
be
altered
and
it
shall
he
seemed
quite
like
a
little
boy
when
he
put
out
his
hand
to
hers
and
spoke
sobbingly
she
she
says
that
because
you
have
only
just
come
from
america
and
in
america
people
can
do
things
you
will
think
you
can
do
things
here
and
you
do
know
he
will
tell
lies
about
you
lies
you
bear
she
sat
wringing
her
hands
when
she
thought
of
it
she
let
you
be
hurt
because
you
want
to
help
he
stopped
abruptly
and
clutched
her
shoulder
aunt
betty
aunt
betty
whatever
happens
whatever
he
makes
her
seem
like
you
are
to
know
that
it
is
not
true
now
you
have
come
now
she
has
seen
you
it
would
kill
her
if
you
were
driven
away
and
thought
she
wanted
you
to
i
shall
not
think
that
she
answered
slowly
because
she
realised
that
it
was
well
that
she
had
been
warned
in
time
ughtred
are
you
trying
to
tell
me
that
above
all
things
i
must
not
let
him
think
that
i
came
here
to
help
you
because
if
he
is
angry
he
will
make
us
all
suffer
and
your
mother
most
of
all
he
find
a
way
we
always
know
he
will
he
would
either
be
so
rude
that
you
would
not
stay
here
or
he
would
make
mother
seem
rude
or
he
would
write
lies
to
grandfather
aunt
betty
she
scarcely
believes
you
are
real
yet
if
she
wo
tell
you
things
at
first
please
do
he
looked
quite
like
a
child
again
in
his
appeal
to
her
to
try
to
understand
a
state
of
affairs
so
complicated
could
you
could
you
wait
until
you
have
let
her
get
get
used
to
you
used
to
thinking
that
there
may
be
someone
in
the
world
to
help
her
slowly
yes
i
will
has
anyone
ever
tried
to
help
her
once
or
twice
people
found
out
and
were
sorry
at
first
but
it
only
made
it
worse
because
he
made
them
believe
i
shall
not
try
ughtred
said
betty
a
remote
spark
kindling
in
the
deeps
of
the
pupils
of
her
eyes
i
shall
not
try
now
i
am
going
to
ask
you
some
before
he
left
her
she
had
asked
many
questions
which
were
pertinent
and
searching
and
she
had
learned
things
she
realised
she
could
have
learned
in
no
other
way
and
from
no
other
person
but
for
his
uncanny
sense
of
the
responsibility
he
clearly
had
assumed
in
the
days
when
he
wore
pinafores
and
which
had
brought
him
to
her
room
to
prepare
her
mind
for
what
she
would
find
herself
confronted
with
in
the
way
of
apparently
unexplainable
obstacles
there
was
a
strong
likelihood
that
at
the
outset
she
might
have
found
herself
more
than
once
dangerously
at
a
loss
yes
she
would
have
been
at
a
loss
puzzled
perhaps
greatly
discouraged
she
was
face
to
face
with
a
complication
so
extraordinary
that
one
man
through
mere
persistent
steadiness
in
evil
temper
and
domestic
tyranny
should
have
so
broken
the
creatures
of
his
household
into
abject
submission
and
hopelessness
seemed
too
incredible
such
a
power
appeared
as
remote
from
civilised
existence
in
london
and
new
york
as
did
that
which
had
inflicted
tortures
in
the
dungeons
of
castles
of
old
prisoners
in
such
dungeons
could
utter
no
cry
which
could
reach
the
outside
world
the
prisoners
at
stornham
court
not
four
hours
from
hyde
park
corner
could
utter
none
the
world
could
hear
or
comprehend
if
it
heard
it
sheer
lack
of
power
to
resist
bound
them
hand
and
foot
and
she
betty
vanderpoel
was
here
upon
the
spot
and
as
far
as
she
could
understand
was
being
implored
to
take
no
steps
to
do
nothing
the
atmosphere
in
which
she
had
spent
her
life
the
world
she
had
been
born
into
had
not
made
for
fearfulness
that
one
would
be
at
any
time
defenceless
against
circumstances
and
be
obliged
to
submit
to
outrage
to
be
a
vanderpoel
was
it
was
true
to
be
a
shining
mark
for
envy
as
for
admiration
but
the
fact
removed
obstacles
as
a
rule
and
to
find
one
self
standing
before
a
situation
with
one
hands
figuratively
speaking
tied
was
new
enough
to
arouse
unusual
sensations
she
recalled
with
an
ironic
sense
of
bewilderment
as
a
sort
of
material
evidence
of
her
own
reality
the
fact
that
not
a
week
ago
she
had
stepped
on
to
english
soil
from
the
gangway
of
a
solid
atlantic
liner
it
aided
her
to
resist
the
feeling
that
she
had
been
swept
back
into
the
middle
ages
when
he
is
angry
was
one
of
the
first
questions
she
put
to
ughtred
what
does
he
give
as
his
reason
he
must
profess
to
have
a
when
he
gets
in
a
rage
he
says
it
is
because
mother
is
silly
and
common
and
i
am
badly
brought
up
but
we
always
know
he
wants
money
and
it
makes
him
furious
he
could
kill
us
with
oh
said
betty
i
it
began
that
time
when
he
struck
her
he
said
then
that
it
was
not
decent
that
a
woman
who
was
married
should
keep
her
own
money
he
made
her
give
him
almost
everything
she
had
but
she
wants
to
keep
some
for
me
he
tries
to
make
her
get
more
from
grandfather
but
she
will
not
write
begging
letters
and
she
wo
give
him
what
she
is
saving
for
it
was
a
simple
and
sordid
enough
explanation
in
one
sense
and
it
was
one
of
which
bettina
had
known
not
one
parallel
but
several
having
married
to
ensure
himself
power
over
unquestioned
resources
the
man
had
felt
himself
disgustingly
taken
in
and
avenged
himself
accordingly
in
him
had
been
born
the
makings
of
a
domestic
tyrant
who
even
had
he
been
favoured
by
fortune
would
have
wreaked
his
humours
upon
the
defenceless
things
made
his
property
by
ties
of
blood
and
marriage
and
who
being
unfavoured
would
do
worse
betty
could
see
what
the
years
had
held
for
rosy
and
how
her
weakness
and
timidity
had
been
considered
as
positive
assets
a
woman
who
will
cry
when
she
is
bullied
may
be
counted
upon
to
submit
after
she
has
cried
rosy
had
submitted
up
to
a
certain
point
and
then
with
the
stubbornness
of
a
weak
creature
had
stood
at
timid
bay
for
her
young
what
betty
gathered
was
that
after
the
long
and
terrible
illness
which
had
followed
ughtred
birth
she
had
risen
from
what
had
been
so
nearly
her
deathbed
prostrated
in
both
mind
and
body
ughtred
did
not
know
all
that
he
revealed
when
he
touched
upon
the
time
which
he
said
his
mother
could
not
quite
remember
when
she
had
sat
for
months
staring
vacantly
out
of
her
window
trying
to
recall
something
terrible
which
had
happened
and
which
she
wanted
to
tell
her
mother
if
the
day
ever
came
when
she
could
write
to
her
again
she
had
never
remembered
clearly
the
details
of
the
thing
she
had
wanted
to
tell
and
nigel
had
insisted
that
her
fancy
was
part
of
her
past
delirium
he
had
said
that
at
the
beginning
of
her
delirium
she
had
attacked
and
insulted
his
mother
and
himself
but
they
had
excused
her
because
they
realised
afterwards
what
the
cause
of
her
excitement
had
been
for
a
long
time
she
had
been
too
brokenly
weak
to
question
or
disbelieve
but
later
she
had
vaguely
known
that
he
had
been
lying
to
her
though
she
could
not
refute
what
he
said
she
recalled
in
course
of
time
a
horrible
scene
in
which
all
three
of
them
had
raved
at
each
other
and
she
herself
had
shrieked
and
laughed
and
hurled
wild
words
at
nigel
and
he
had
struck
her
that
she
knew
and
never
forgot
she
had
been
ill
a
year
her
hair
had
fallen
out
her
skin
had
faded
and
she
had
begun
to
feel
like
a
nervous
tired
old
woman
instead
of
a
girl
girlhood
with
all
the
past
had
become
unreal
and
too
far
away
to
be
more
than
a
dream
nothing
had
remained
real
but
stornham
and
nigel
and
the
little
hunchbacked
baby
she
was
glad
when
the
dowager
died
and
when
nigel
spent
his
time
in
london
or
on
the
continent
and
left
her
with
ughtred
when
he
said
that
he
must
spend
her
money
on
the
estate
she
had
acquiesced
without
comment
because
that
insured
his
going
away
she
saw
that
no
improvement
or
repairs
were
made
but
she
could
do
nothing
and
was
too
listless
to
make
the
attempt
she
only
wanted
to
be
left
alone
with
ughtred
and
she
exhibited
willpower
only
in
defence
of
her
child
and
in
her
obstinacy
with
regard
to
asking
money
of
her
father
she
thought
somehow
that
grandfather
and
grandmother
did
not
care
for
her
any
more
that
they
had
forgotten
her
and
only
cared
for
you
ughtred
explained
she
used
to
talk
to
me
about
you
she
said
you
must
be
so
clever
and
so
handsome
that
no
one
could
remember
her
sometimes
she
cried
and
said
she
did
not
want
any
of
you
to
see
her
again
because
she
was
only
a
hideous
little
thin
yellow
old
woman
when
i
was
very
little
she
told
me
stories
about
new
york
and
fifth
avenue
i
thought
they
were
not
real
places
i
though
they
were
places
in
betty
patted
his
shoulder
and
looked
away
for
a
moment
when
he
said
this
in
her
remote
and
helpless
loneliness
to
rosy
homesick
yearning
soul
noisy
rattling
new
york
fifth
avenue
with
its
traffic
and
people
its
houses
and
ricketty
stages
had
seemed
like
that
so
splendid
and
bright
and
that
she
had
painted
them
in
colours
which
could
belong
only
to
fairyland
it
said
so
much
the
thing
she
had
suspected
as
she
had
talked
to
her
sister
was
before
the
interview
ended
made
curiously
clear
the
first
obstacle
in
her
pathway
would
be
the
shrinking
of
a
creature
who
had
been
so
long
under
dominion
that
the
mere
thought
of
seeing
any
steps
taken
towards
her
rescue
filled
her
with
alarm
one
might
be
prepared
for
her
almost
praying
to
be
let
alone
because
she
felt
that
the
process
of
her
salvation
would
bring
about
such
shocks
and
torments
as
she
could
not
endure
the
facing
of
she
will
have
to
get
used
to
you
ughtred
kept
saying
she
will
have
to
get
used
to
thinking
i
will
be
careful
bettina
answered
she
shall
not
be
troubled
i
did
not
come
to
trouble
chapter
xiii
one
of
the
new
york
dresses
as
she
went
down
the
staircase
later
on
her
way
to
dinner
miss
vanderpoel
saw
on
all
sides
signs
of
the
extent
of
the
nakedness
of
the
land
she
was
in
a
fine
old
house
stripped
of
most
of
its
saleable
belongings
uncared
for
deteriorating
year
by
year
gradually
going
to
ruin
one
need
not
possess
particular
keenness
of
sight
to
observe
this
and
she
had
chanced
to
see
old
houses
in
like
condition
in
other
countries
than
england
a
in
a
shabby
livery
opened
the
door
for
her
he
was
not
a
picturesque
servitor
of
fallen
fortunes
but
an
awkward
person
who
was
not
accustomed
to
his
duties
betty
wondered
if
he
had
been
called
in
from
the
gardens
to
meet
the
necessities
of
the
moment
his
furtive
glance
at
the
tall
young
woman
who
passed
him
took
in
with
sudden
embarrassment
the
fact
that
she
plainly
did
not
belong
to
the
dispirited
world
bounded
by
stornham
court
without
sparkling
gems
or
trailing
richness
in
her
wake
she
was
suggestively
splendid
he
did
not
know
whether
it
was
her
hair
or
the
build
of
her
neck
and
shoulders
that
did
it
but
it
was
revealed
to
him
that
tiaras
and
collars
of
stones
which
blazed
belonged
without
doubt
to
her
equipment
he
recalled
that
there
was
a
legend
to
the
effect
that
the
present
lady
anstruthers
who
looked
like
a
rag
doll
had
been
the
daughter
of
a
rich
american
and
that
better
things
might
have
been
expected
of
her
if
she
had
not
been
such
a
creature
if
this
was
her
sister
she
perhaps
was
a
young
woman
of
fortune
and
that
she
was
not
of
poor
spirit
was
plain
the
large
presented
but
another
aspect
of
the
bareness
of
the
rest
of
the
house
in
times
probably
long
past
possibly
in
the
dowager
lady
anstruthers
early
years
of
marriage
the
walls
had
been
hung
with
white
and
gold
paper
of
a
pattern
which
dominated
the
scene
and
had
been
furnished
with
gilded
chairs
tables
and
ottomans
some
of
these
last
had
evidently
been
removed
as
they
became
too
much
out
of
repair
for
use
or
ornament
such
as
remained
tarnished
as
to
gilding
and
worn
in
the
matter
of
upholstery
stood
sparsely
scattered
on
a
desert
of
carpet
whose
huge
flowered
medallions
had
faded
almost
from
view
lady
anstruthers
looking
shy
and
awkward
as
she
fingered
an
ornament
on
a
small
table
seemed
singularly
a
part
of
her
background
her
evening
dress
slipping
off
her
thin
shoulders
was
as
faded
and
out
of
date
as
her
carpet
it
had
once
been
delicately
blue
and
gauzy
but
its
gauziness
hung
in
crushed
folds
and
its
blue
was
almost
grey
it
was
also
the
dress
of
a
girl
not
that
of
a
colourless
worn
woman
and
her
consciousness
of
its
unfitness
showed
in
her
face
as
she
came
forward
do
you
recognise
it
betty
she
asked
hesitatingly
it
was
one
of
my
new
york
dresses
i
put
it
on
because
because
and
her
stammering
ended
helplessly
because
you
wanted
to
remind
me
betty
said
if
she
felt
it
easier
to
begin
with
an
excuse
she
should
be
provided
with
one
perhaps
but
for
this
readiness
to
fall
into
any
tone
she
chose
to
adopt
rosy
might
have
endeavoured
to
carry
her
poor
farce
on
but
as
it
was
she
suddenly
gave
it
up
i
put
it
on
because
i
have
no
other
she
said
we
never
have
visitors
and
i
have
dressed
for
dinner
for
so
long
that
i
seem
to
have
nothing
left
that
is
fit
to
wear
i
dragged
this
out
because
it
was
better
than
anything
else
it
was
pretty
once
she
gave
a
little
laugh
twelve
years
ago
how
long
years
seem
was
i
was
i
pretty
betty
twelve
years
ago
twelve
years
is
not
such
a
long
betty
took
her
hand
and
drew
her
to
a
sofa
let
us
sit
down
and
talk
about
there
is
nothing
much
to
talk
about
this
is
it
taking
in
the
room
with
a
wave
of
her
hand
i
am
it
ughtred
is
then
let
us
talk
about
england
was
bettina
light
skim
over
the
thin
ice
a
red
spot
grew
on
each
of
lady
anstruthers
cheek
bones
and
made
her
faded
eyes
look
intense
let
us
talk
about
america
her
little
birdclaw
of
a
hand
clinging
feverishly
is
new
york
still
still
it
is
still
there
betty
answered
with
one
of
the
adorable
smiles
which
showed
a
deep
dimple
near
her
lip
but
it
is
much
nearer
england
than
it
used
to
nearer
the
hand
tightened
as
rosy
caught
her
breath
betty
bent
rather
suddenly
and
kissed
her
it
was
the
easiest
way
of
hiding
the
look
she
knew
had
risen
to
her
eyes
she
began
to
talk
gaily
half
laughingly
it
is
quite
near
she
said
do
you
realise
it
americans
swoop
over
here
by
thousands
every
year
they
come
for
business
they
come
for
pleasure
they
come
for
rest
they
can
not
keep
away
they
come
to
buy
and
sell
pictures
and
books
and
luxuries
and
lands
they
come
to
give
and
take
they
are
building
a
bridge
from
shore
to
shore
of
their
work
and
their
thoughts
and
their
plannings
out
of
the
lives
and
souls
of
them
it
will
be
a
great
bridge
and
great
things
will
pass
over
she
kissed
the
faded
cheek
again
she
wanted
to
sweep
rosy
away
from
the
dreariness
of
lady
anstruthers
looked
at
her
with
faintly
smiling
eyes
she
did
not
follow
all
this
quite
readily
but
she
felt
pleased
and
vaguely
comforted
i
know
how
they
come
here
and
marry
she
said
the
new
duchess
of
downes
is
an
american
she
had
a
fortune
of
two
million
if
she
chooses
to
rebuild
a
great
house
and
a
great
name
said
betty
lifting
her
shoulders
lightly
why
not
if
it
is
an
honest
bargain
i
suppose
it
is
part
of
the
building
of
the
little
lady
anstruthers
trying
to
pull
up
the
sleeves
of
the
gauzy
bodice
slipping
off
her
small
sharp
bones
stared
at
her
half
in
wondering
adoration
half
in
alarm
betty
you
you
are
so
handsome
and
so
clever
and
strange
she
fluttered
oh
betty
stand
up
so
that
i
can
see
how
tall
and
handsome
you
are
betty
did
as
she
was
told
and
upon
her
feet
she
was
a
young
woman
of
long
lines
and
fine
curves
so
inspiring
to
behold
that
lady
anstruthers
clasped
her
hands
together
on
her
knees
in
an
excited
gesture
oh
yes
oh
yes
she
cried
you
are
just
as
wonderful
as
you
looked
when
i
turned
and
saw
you
under
the
trees
you
almost
make
me
because
i
am
wonderful
said
betty
then
i
will
not
be
wonderful
any
it
is
not
because
i
think
you
wonderful
but
because
other
people
will
would
you
rebuild
a
great
house
hesitatingly
the
fine
line
of
betty
black
brows
drew
itself
slightly
together
no
she
said
would
you
how
could
the
man
who
owned
it
persuade
me
that
he
was
in
earnest
if
he
said
he
loved
me
how
could
i
persuade
him
that
i
was
worth
caring
for
and
not
a
mere
ambitious
fool
there
would
be
too
much
against
against
you
repeated
lady
anstruthers
i
do
say
i
am
fair
said
betty
people
who
are
proud
are
often
not
fair
but
we
should
both
of
us
have
seen
and
known
too
you
have
seen
me
now
said
lady
anstruthers
in
her
listless
voice
and
at
the
same
moment
dinner
was
announced
and
she
got
up
from
the
sofa
so
that
luckily
there
was
no
time
for
the
impersonal
answer
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
invent
at
a
moment
notice
as
they
went
into
the
betty
was
thinking
restlessly
she
remembered
all
the
material
she
had
collected
during
her
education
in
france
and
germany
and
there
was
added
to
it
the
fact
that
she
had
seen
rosy
and
having
her
before
her
eyes
she
felt
that
there
was
small
prospect
of
her
contemplating
the
rebuilding
of
any
great
house
requiring
reconstruction
there
was
fine
panelling
in
the
and
a
great
fireplace
and
a
few
family
portraits
the
service
upon
the
table
was
shabby
and
the
dinner
was
not
a
bounteous
meal
lady
anstruthers
in
her
girlish
gauzy
dress
and
looking
too
small
for
her
big
chair
tried
to
talk
rapidly
and
every
few
minutes
forgot
herself
and
sank
into
silence
with
her
eyes
unconsciously
fixed
upon
her
sister
face
ughtred
watched
betty
also
and
with
a
hungry
questioning
the
in
the
worn
livery
was
not
a
sufficiently
and
experienced
domestic
to
make
any
effort
to
keep
his
eyes
from
her
he
was
young
enough
to
be
excited
by
an
innovation
so
unusual
as
the
presence
of
a
young
and
beautiful
person
surrounded
by
an
unmistakable
atmosphere
of
ease
and
fearlessness
he
had
been
talking
of
her
below
stairs
and
felt
that
he
had
failed
in
describing
her
he
had
found
himself
barely
supported
by
the
suggestion
of
a
housemaid
that
sometimes
these
dresses
that
looked
plain
had
been
made
in
paris
at
expensive
places
and
had
cost
a
he
furtively
examined
the
dress
which
looked
plain
and
while
he
admitted
that
for
some
mysterious
reason
it
might
represent
expensiveness
it
was
not
the
dress
which
was
the
secret
of
the
effect
but
a
something
not
altogether
mere
good
looks
expressed
by
the
wearer
it
was
in
fact
the
thing
which
the
passenger
salter
had
been
at
once
attracted
and
stirred
to
rebellion
by
when
miss
vanderpoel
came
on
board
the
meridiana
betty
did
not
look
too
small
for
her
chair
and
she
did
not
forget
herself
when
she
talked
in
spite
of
all
she
had
found
her
imagination
was
stirred
by
the
surroundings
her
sense
of
the
fine
spaces
and
possibilities
of
dignity
in
the
barren
house
her
knowledge
that
outside
the
windows
there
lay
stretched
broad
views
of
the
park
and
its
trees
and
that
outside
the
gates
stood
the
neglected
picturesqueness
of
the
village
and
all
the
rural
and
to
her
interesting
life
it
slowly
lived
this
pleased
and
attracted
her
if
she
had
been
as
helpless
and
discouraged
as
rosalie
she
could
see
that
it
would
all
have
meant
a
totally
different
and
depressing
thing
but
strong
and
spirited
and
with
the
power
of
full
hands
she
was
remotely
rejoicing
in
what
might
be
done
with
it
all
as
she
talked
she
was
gradually
learning
detail
sir
nigel
was
on
the
continent
apparently
he
often
went
there
also
it
revealed
itself
that
no
one
knew
at
what
moment
he
might
return
for
what
reason
he
would
return
or
if
he
would
return
at
all
during
the
summer
it
was
evident
that
no
one
had
been
at
any
time
encouraged
to
ask
questions
as
to
his
intentions
or
to
feel
that
they
had
a
right
to
do
so
this
she
knew
and
a
number
of
other
things
before
they
left
the
table
when
they
did
so
they
went
out
to
stroll
upon
the
stone
terrace
and
listened
to
the
nightingales
throwing
into
the
air
silver
fountains
of
trilling
song
when
bettina
paused
leaning
against
the
balustrade
of
the
terrace
that
she
might
hear
all
the
beauty
of
it
and
feel
all
the
beauty
of
the
warm
spring
night
rosy
went
on
making
her
effort
to
talk
it
is
not
much
of
a
neighbourhood
betty
she
said
you
are
too
accustomed
to
livelier
places
to
like
that
is
my
reason
for
feeling
that
i
shall
like
it
i
do
think
i
could
be
called
a
lively
person
and
i
rather
hate
lively
but
you
are
accustomed
accustomed
rosy
harked
back
uncertainly
i
have
been
accustomed
to
wishing
that
i
could
come
to
you
said
betty
and
now
i
am
lady
anstruthers
laid
a
hand
on
her
dress
i
ca
believe
it
i
ca
believe
it
she
breathed
you
will
believe
it
said
betty
drawing
the
hand
around
her
waist
and
enclosing
in
her
own
arm
the
narrow
shoulders
tell
me
about
the
there
is
any
really
said
lady
anstruthers
the
houses
are
so
far
away
from
each
other
the
nearest
is
six
miles
from
here
and
it
is
one
that
does
count
why
there
is
no
family
and
the
man
who
owns
it
is
so
poor
it
is
a
big
place
but
it
is
falling
to
pieces
as
this
is
what
is
it
called
mount
dunstan
the
present
earl
only
succeeded
about
three
years
ago
nigel
does
know
him
he
is
queer
and
not
liked
he
has
been
where
no
one
knows
to
australia
or
somewhere
he
has
odd
ideas
the
mount
dunstans
have
been
awful
people
for
two
generations
this
man
father
was
almost
mad
with
wickedness
so
was
the
elder
son
this
is
a
second
son
and
he
came
into
nothing
but
debt
perhaps
he
feels
the
disgrace
and
it
makes
him
rude
and
his
father
and
elder
brother
had
been
in
such
scandals
that
people
did
not
invite
them
do
they
invite
this
man
no
he
probably
would
not
go
to
their
houses
if
they
did
and
he
went
away
soon
after
he
came
into
the
is
the
place
beautiful
there
is
a
fine
deer
park
and
the
gardens
were
wonderful
a
long
time
ago
the
house
is
worth
looking
at
i
will
go
and
look
at
it
said
betty
the
carriage
is
out
of
order
there
is
only
ughtred
i
am
a
good
walker
said
betty
are
you
it
would
be
twelve
miles
there
and
back
when
i
was
in
new
york
people
did
walk
much
particularly
they
do
now
betty
answered
they
have
learned
to
do
it
in
england
they
live
out
of
doors
and
play
games
they
have
grown
athletic
and
as
they
talked
the
nightingales
sang
sometimes
near
sometimes
in
the
distance
and
scents
of
dewy
grass
and
leaves
and
earth
were
wafted
towards
them
sometimes
they
strolled
up
and
down
the
terrace
sometimes
they
paused
and
leaned
against
the
stone
balustrade
betty
allowed
rosy
to
talk
as
she
chose
she
herself
asked
no
obviously
leading
questions
and
passed
over
trying
moments
with
lightness
her
desire
was
to
place
herself
in
a
position
where
she
might
hear
the
things
which
would
aid
her
to
draw
conclusions
lady
anstruthers
gradually
grew
less
nervous
and
afraid
of
her
subjects
in
the
wonder
of
the
luxury
of
talking
to
someone
who
listened
with
sympathy
she
once
or
twice
almost
forgot
herself
and
made
revelations
she
had
not
intended
to
make
she
had
often
the
manner
of
a
person
who
was
afraid
of
being
overheard
sometimes
even
when
she
was
making
speeches
quite
simple
in
themselves
her
voice
dropped
and
she
glanced
furtively
aside
as
if
there
were
chances
that
something
she
dreaded
might
step
out
of
the
shadow
when
they
went
upstairs
together
and
parted
for
the
night
the
clinging
of
rosy
embrace
was
for
a
moment
almost
convulsive
but
she
tried
to
laugh
off
its
suggestion
of
intensity
i
held
you
tight
so
that
i
could
feel
sure
that
you
were
real
and
would
not
melt
away
she
said
i
hope
you
will
be
here
in
the
i
shall
never
really
go
quite
away
again
now
i
have
come
betty
answered
it
is
not
only
your
house
i
have
come
into
i
have
come
back
into
your
after
she
had
entered
her
room
and
locked
the
door
she
sat
down
and
wrote
a
letter
to
her
father
it
was
a
long
letter
but
a
clear
one
she
painted
a
definite
and
detailed
picture
and
made
distinct
her
chief
point
she
is
afraid
of
me
she
wrote
that
is
the
first
and
worst
obstacle
she
is
actually
afraid
that
i
will
do
something
which
will
only
add
to
her
trouble
she
has
lived
under
dominion
so
long
that
she
has
forgotten
that
there
are
people
who
have
no
reason
for
fear
her
old
life
seems
nothing
but
a
dream
the
first
thing
i
must
teach
her
is
that
i
am
to
be
trusted
not
to
do
futile
things
and
that
she
need
neither
be
afraid
of
nor
for
after
writing
these
sentences
she
found
herself
leaving
her
desk
and
walking
up
and
down
the
room
to
relieve
herself
she
could
not
sit
still
because
suddenly
the
blood
ran
fast
and
hot
through
her
veins
she
put
her
hands
against
her
cheeks
and
laughed
a
little
low
laugh
i
feel
violent
she
said
i
feel
violent
and
i
must
get
over
it
this
is
rage
rage
is
worth
it
was
rage
the
rage
of
splendid
hot
blood
which
surged
in
answer
to
leaping
hot
thoughts
there
would
have
been
a
sort
of
luxury
in
giving
way
to
the
sway
of
it
but
the
would
have
been
no
aid
to
future
action
rage
was
worth
nothing
she
said
it
as
the
first
reuben
vanderpoel
might
have
said
of
a
useless
but
glittering
weapon
this
gun
is
worth
nothing
and
cast
it
aside
chapter
xiv
in
the
gardens
she
came
out
upon
the
stone
terrace
again
rather
early
in
the
morning
she
wanted
to
wander
about
in
the
first
freshness
of
the
day
which
was
always
an
uplifting
thing
to
her
she
wanted
to
see
the
dew
on
the
grass
and
on
the
ragged
flower
borders
and
to
hear
the
tender
broken
fluting
of
birds
in
the
trees
one
cuckoo
was
calling
to
another
in
the
park
and
she
stopped
and
listened
intently
until
yesterday
she
had
never
heard
a
cuckoo
call
and
its
hollow
mellowness
gave
her
delight
it
meant
the
spring
in
england
and
nowhere
else
there
was
space
enough
to
ramble
about
in
the
gardens
paths
and
beds
were
alike
overgrown
with
weeds
but
some
strong
things
were
fighting
for
life
refusing
to
be
strangled
against
the
beautiful
old
red
walls
over
which
age
had
stolen
with
a
wonderful
grey
bloom
venerable
fruit
trees
were
spread
and
nailed
and
here
and
there
showed
bloom
clumps
of
things
sturdily
advanced
their
yellowness
or
whiteness
as
if
defying
neglect
in
one
place
a
wall
slanted
and
threatened
to
fall
bearing
its
nectarine
trees
with
it
in
another
there
was
a
gap
so
evidently
not
of
that
the
heap
of
its
masonry
upon
the
border
bed
was
already
covered
with
greenery
and
the
roots
of
the
fruit
tree
it
had
supported
had
sent
up
strong
insistent
shoots
she
passed
down
broad
paths
and
narrow
ones
sometimes
walking
under
trees
sometimes
pushing
her
way
between
encroaching
shrubs
she
descended
delightful
mossy
and
broken
steps
and
came
upon
dilapidated
urns
in
which
weeds
grew
instead
of
flowers
and
over
which
rampant
but
lovely
savage
little
creepers
clambered
and
clung
in
one
of
the
walled
kitchen
gardens
she
came
upon
an
elderly
gardener
at
work
at
the
sound
of
her
approaching
steps
he
glanced
round
and
then
stood
up
touching
his
forelock
in
respectful
but
startled
salute
he
was
so
plainly
amazed
at
the
sight
of
her
that
she
explained
herself
she
said
i
am
her
ladyship
sister
miss
vanderpoel
i
came
yesterday
evening
i
am
looking
over
your
he
touched
his
forehead
again
and
looked
round
him
his
manner
was
not
cheerful
he
cast
a
troubled
eye
about
him
they
not
much
to
see
miss
he
said
they
ought
to
be
but
they
not
growing
things
has
to
be
fed
and
took
care
of
a
man
and
a
boy
ca
do
it
nor
yet
four
or
five
of
how
many
ought
there
to
be
betty
inquired
with
directness
it
was
not
only
the
dew
on
the
grass
she
had
come
out
to
see
if
there
was
eight
or
ten
of
us
we
might
put
it
in
order
and
keep
it
that
way
it
a
big
place
betty
looked
about
her
as
he
had
done
but
with
a
less
discouraged
eye
it
is
a
beautiful
place
as
well
as
a
large
one
she
said
i
can
see
that
there
ought
to
be
more
there
no
one
said
the
gardener
as
has
as
many
enemies
as
a
gardener
an
as
many
things
to
fight
there
grubs
an
greenfly
an
there
drout
an
wet
an
cold
an
mildew
an
what
the
soil
wants
and
starves
without
an
if
you
have
got
it
nor
yet
hands
an
feet
an
tools
enough
how
things
to
feed
an
fight
live
let
alone
bloom
an
bear
i
do
know
much
about
gardens
said
miss
vanderpoel
but
i
can
understand
the
scent
of
fresh
bedewed
things
was
in
the
air
it
was
true
that
she
had
not
known
much
about
gardens
but
here
standing
in
the
midst
of
one
she
began
to
awaken
to
a
new
practical
interest
a
creature
of
initiative
could
not
let
such
a
place
as
this
alone
it
was
beauty
being
slowly
slain
one
could
not
pass
it
by
and
do
nothing
what
is
your
name
she
asked
kedgers
miss
i
only
been
here
about
a
i
was
took
on
because
i
getting
on
in
years
an
ca
ask
much
can
you
spare
time
to
take
me
through
the
gardens
and
show
me
things
yes
he
could
do
it
in
truth
he
privately
welcomed
an
opportunity
offering
a
prospect
of
excitement
so
novel
he
had
shown
more
flourishing
gardens
to
other
young
ladies
in
his
past
years
of
service
but
young
ladies
did
not
come
to
stornham
and
that
one
having
with
such
extraordinary
unexpectedness
arrived
should
want
to
look
over
the
desolation
of
these
was
curious
enough
to
rouse
anyone
to
a
sense
of
a
break
in
accustomed
monotony
the
young
lady
herself
mystified
him
by
her
difference
from
such
others
as
he
had
seen
what
the
man
in
the
shabby
livery
had
felt
he
felt
also
and
added
to
this
was
a
sense
of
the
practicalness
of
the
questions
she
asked
and
the
interest
she
showed
and
a
way
she
had
of
seeming
singularly
to
suggest
by
the
look
in
her
eyes
and
the
tone
of
her
voice
that
nothing
was
necessarily
without
remedy
when
her
ladyship
walked
through
the
place
and
looked
at
things
a
pale
resignation
expressed
itself
in
the
very
droop
of
her
figure
when
this
one
walked
through
the
and
conservatories
she
saw
where
glass
was
broken
where
benches
had
fallen
and
where
roofs
sagged
and
leaked
she
inquired
about
the
heating
apparatus
and
asked
that
she
might
see
it
she
asked
about
the
village
and
its
resources
about
labourers
and
their
wages
as
if
commented
kedgers
mentally
she
was
what
sir
nigel
is
leastways
what
he
ought
to
be
an
she
led
the
way
back
to
the
fallen
wall
and
stood
and
looked
at
it
it
a
beautiful
old
wall
she
said
it
should
be
rebuilt
with
the
old
brick
new
would
spoil
some
of
this
is
broken
and
crumbled
away
said
kedgers
picking
up
a
piece
to
show
it
to
her
perhaps
old
brick
could
be
bought
somewhere
replied
the
young
lady
speculatively
one
ought
to
be
able
to
buy
old
brick
in
england
if
one
is
willing
to
pay
for
kedgers
scratched
his
head
and
gazed
at
her
in
respectful
wonder
which
was
almost
trouble
who
was
going
to
pay
for
things
and
who
was
going
to
look
for
things
which
were
not
on
the
spot
enterprise
like
this
was
not
to
be
explained
when
she
left
him
he
stood
and
watched
her
upright
figure
disappear
through
the
door
of
the
kitchen
gardens
with
a
disturbed
but
elated
expression
on
his
countenance
he
did
not
know
why
he
felt
elated
but
he
was
conscious
of
elation
something
new
had
walked
into
the
place
he
stopped
his
work
and
grinned
and
scratched
his
head
several
times
after
he
went
back
to
his
pottering
among
the
cabbage
plants
my
word
he
muttered
she
a
fine
straight
young
woman
if
she
was
her
ladyship
things
be
different
sir
nigel
be
different
too
or
there
be
some
fine
there
was
a
huge
stable
yard
and
betty
passed
through
that
on
her
way
back
the
door
of
the
carriage
house
was
open
and
she
saw
two
or
three
vehicles
one
was
a
landau
with
a
wheel
off
one
was
a
shabby
low
phaeton
she
caught
sight
of
a
patently
venerable
cob
in
one
of
the
stables
the
stalls
near
him
were
empty
i
suppose
that
is
all
they
have
to
depend
upon
she
thought
and
the
stables
are
like
the
she
found
lady
anstruthers
and
ughtred
waiting
for
her
upon
the
terrace
each
of
them
regarding
her
with
an
expression
suggestive
of
repressed
curiosity
as
she
approached
lady
anstruthers
flushed
a
little
and
went
to
meet
her
with
an
eager
kiss
you
look
like
i
do
know
quite
what
you
look
like
betty
she
exclaimed
the
girl
dimple
deepened
and
her
eyes
said
smiling
things
it
is
the
morning
and
your
gardens
she
answered
i
have
been
round
your
they
were
beautiful
once
i
suppose
said
rosy
deprecatingly
they
are
beautiful
now
there
is
nothing
like
them
in
america
at
i
do
remember
any
gardens
in
america
lady
anstruthers
owned
reluctantly
but
everything
seemed
so
cheerful
and
well
cared
for
and
and
new
do
laugh
betty
i
have
begun
to
like
new
things
you
would
if
you
had
watched
old
ones
tumbling
to
pieces
for
twelve
they
ought
not
to
be
allowed
to
tumble
to
pieces
said
betty
she
added
her
next
words
with
simple
directness
she
could
only
discover
how
any
advancing
steps
would
be
taken
by
taking
them
why
do
you
allow
them
to
do
it
lady
anstruthers
looked
away
but
as
she
looked
her
eyes
passed
ughtred
i
she
said
there
are
so
many
other
things
to
do
it
would
cost
so
much
such
an
enormity
to
keep
it
all
in
but
it
ought
to
be
done
for
ughtred
i
know
that
faltered
rosy
but
i
ca
help
you
can
answered
betty
and
she
put
her
arm
round
her
as
they
turned
to
enter
the
house
when
you
have
become
more
used
to
me
and
my
driving
american
ways
i
will
show
you
the
lightness
with
which
she
said
it
had
an
odd
effect
on
lady
anstruthers
such
casual
readiness
was
so
full
of
the
suggestion
of
unheard
of
possibilities
that
it
was
a
kind
of
shock
i
have
been
twelve
years
in
getting
to
you
i
feel
as
if
it
would
take
twelve
years
more
to
get
used
again
she
said
it
wo
take
twelve
weeks
said
betty
chapter

the

the
mystery
of
the
apparently
occult
methods
of
communication
among
the
natives
of
india
between
whom
it
is
said
news
flies
by
means
too
strange
and
subtle
to
be
humanly
explainable
is
no
more
difficult
a
problem
to
solve
than
that
of
the
lightning
rapidity
with
which
a
knowledge
of
the
transpiring
of
any
new
local
event
darts
through
the
slowest
and
as
far
as
outward
signs
go
the
least
communicative
english
village
slumbering
drowsily
among
its
pastures
and
trees
that
which
the
hall
or
manor
house
believed
last
night
known
only
to
the
four
walls
of
its

discussed
over
the
cottage

tables
as
though
presented
in
detail
through
the
columns
of
the
morning
post
the
vicarage
the
smithy
the
post
office
the
little
provision
shop
are
instantaneously
informed
as
by
magic
of
such
incidents
of
interest
as
occur
and
are
prepared
to
assist
vicariously
at
any
future
developments
through
what
agency
information
is
given
no
one
can
tell
and
indeed
the
agency
is
of
small
moment
facts
of
interest
are
perhaps
like
flights
of
swallows
and
dart
chattering
from
one
red
roof
to
another
proclaiming
themselves
aloud
nothing
is
so
true
as
that
in
such
villages
they
are
the
property
and
innocent
playthings
of
man
woman
and
child
providing
conversation
and
drama
otherwise
likely
to
be
lacked
when
miss
vanderpoel
walked
through
stornham
village
street
she
became
aware
that
she
was
an
exciting
object
of
interest
faces
appeared
at
cottage
windows
women
sauntered
to
doors
men
in
the
taproom
of
the
clock
inn
left
beer
mugs
to
cast
an
eye
on
her
children
pushed
open
gates
and
stared
as
they
bobbed
their
curtsies
the
young
woman
who
kept
the
shop
left
her
counter
and
came
out
upon
her
door
step
to
pick
up
her
straying
baby
and
glance
over
its
shoulder
at
the
face
with
the
red
mouth
and
the
mass
of
black
hair
rolled
upward
under
a
rough
blue
straw
hat
everyone
knew
who
this
young
lady
was
she
had
arrived
yesterday
from
london
and
a
week
ago
by
means
of
a
ship
from
america
from
the
country
in
connection
with
which
the
rural
mind
curiously
mixed
up
large
wages
great
fortunes
and
indians
gaarge
lunsden
having
spent
five
years
of
his
youth
labouring
heavily
for
sixteen
shillings
a
week
had
gone
to
meriker
and
had
earned
there
eight
shillings
a
day
this
was
a
and
over
fact
and
had
elevated
the
western
continent
to
a
position
of
trust
and
importance
it
had
seriously
lacked
before
the
emigration
of
lunsden
a
place
where
a
man
could
earn
eight
shillings
a
day
inspired
interest
as
well
as
confidence
when
sir
nigel
wife
had
arrived
twelve
years
ago
as
the
new
lady
anstruthers
the
story
that
she
herself
had
money
had
been
verified
by
her
fine
clothes
and
her
way
of
handing
out
sovereigns
in
cases
where
the
rest
of
the
gentry
if
they
gave
at
all
would
have
bestowed
tea
and
flannel
or
shillings
there
had
been
for
a
few
months
a
period
of
unheard
of
in
stornham
village
everyone
remembered
the
hundred
pounds
the
bride
had
given
to
poor
wilson
when
his
place
had
burned
down
but
the
village
had
of
course
learned
by
its
occult
means
that
sir
nigel
and
the
dowager
had
been
angry
and
that
there
had
been
a
quarrel
afterwards
her
ladyship
had
been
dangerously
ill
the
baby
had
been
born
a
hunchback
and
a
year
had
passed
before
its
mother
had
been
seen
again
since
then
she
had
been
a
changed
creature
she
had
lost
her
looks
and
seemed
to
care
for
nothing
but
the
child
stornham
village
saw
next
to
nothing
of
her
and
it
certainly
was
not
she
who
had
the
dispensing
of
her
fortune
rumour
said
sir
nigel
lived
high
in
london
and
foreign
parts
but
there
was
no
high
living
at
the
court
her
ladyship
family
had
never
been
near
her
and
belief
in
them
and
their
wealth
almost
ceased
to
exist
if
they
were
rich
stornham
felt
that
it
was
their
business
to
mend
roofs
and
windows
and
not
allow
chimneys
and
kitchen
boilers
to
fall
into
ruin
the
simple
leading
article
of
faith
being
that
even
american
money
belonged
properly
to
england
as
miss
vanderpoel
walked
at
a
light
swinging
pace
through
the
one
village
street
the
gazers
felt
with
kedgers
that
something
new
was
passing
and
stirring
the
atmosphere
she
looked
straight
and
with
a
friendliness
somehow
dominating
at
the
curious
women
her
handsome
eyes
met
those
of
the
men
in
a
human
questioning
she
smiled
and
nodded
to
the
bobbing
children
one
of
these
young
enough
to
be
uncertain
on
its
feet
in
running
to
join
some
others
stumbled
and
fell
on
the
path
before
her
opening
its
mouth
in
the
inevitable
resultant
roar
it
was
shocked
almost
into
silence
by
the
tall
young
lady
stooping
at
once
picking
it
up
and
cheerfully
dusting
its
pinafore
do
cry
she
said
you
are
not
hurt
you
the
deep
dimple
near
her
mouth
showed
itself
and
the
laugh
in
her
eyes
was
so
reassuring
that
the
penny
she
put
into
the
grubby
hand
was
less
productive
of
effect
than
her
mere
self
she
walked
on
leaving
the
group
staring
after
her
breathless
because
of
a
sense
of
having
met
with
a
wonderful
adventure
the
grand
young
lady
with
the
black
hair
and
the
blue
hat
and
tall
straight
body
was
the
adventure
she
left
the
same
sense
of
event
with
the
village
itself
they
talked
of
her
all
day
over
their
garden
palings
on
their
doorsteps
in
the
street
of
her
looks
of
her
height
of
the
black
rim
of
lashes
round
her
eyes
of
the
chance
that
she
might
be
rich
and
ready
to
give
and
sovereigns
of
the
meriker
she
had
come
from
and
above
all
of
the
reason
for
her
coming
betty
swung
with
the
light
firm
step
of
a
good
walker
out
on
to
the
highway
to
walk
upon
the
fine
smooth
old
roman
road
was
a
pleasure
in
itself
but
she
soon
struck
away
from
it
and
went
through
lanes
and
following
because
she
knew
where
she
was
going
her
walk
was
to
take
her
to
mount
dunstan
and
home
again
by
another
road
in
walking
an
objective
point
forms
an
interest
and
what
she
had
heard
of
the
estate
from
rosalie
was
a
vague
reason
for
her
caring
to
see
it
it
was
another
place
like
stornham
once
dignified
and
nobly
representative
of
fine
things
now
losing
their
meanings
and
values
values
and
meanings
other
than
mere
signs
of
wealth
and
power
there
had
been
centuries
ago
strong
creatures
had
planned
and
built
it
for
such
reasons
as
strength
has
for
its
planning
and
building
in
bettina
imagination
the
first
man
held
powerful
and
moving
sway
it
was
he
whom
she
always
saw
in
history
as
a
child
at
school
she
had
understood
and
drawn
close
to
him
there
was
always
a
first
man
behind
all
that
one
saw
or
was
told
one
who
was
the
fighter
the
human
thing
who
snatched
weapons
and
tools
from
stones
and
trees
and
wielded
them
in
the
carrying
out
of
the
thought
which
was
his
possession
and
his
strength
he
was
the
god
made
human
others
waited
without
knowledge
of
their
waiting
for
the
signal
he
gave
a
man
like
others
with
man
body
hands
and
limbs
and
eyes
the
moving
of
a
whole
world
was
subtly
altered
by
his
birth
one
could
not
always
trace
him
but
with
stone
axe
and
spear
point
he
had
won
savage
lands
in
savage
ways
and
so
ruled
them
that
leaving
them
to
other
hands
their
march
towards
less
savage
life
could
not
stay
itself
but
must
sweep
on
others
of
his
kind
striking
rude
harps
had
so
sung
that
the
loud
clearness
of
their
wild
songs
had
rung
through
the
ages
and
echo
still
in
strains
which
are
theirs
though
voices
of
repeat
the
note
of
them
the
first
man
a
briton
stained
with
woad
and
hung
with
skins
had
tilled
the
luscious
greenness
of
the
lands
richly
rolling
now
within
hedge
boundaries
the
square
church
towers
rose
holding
their
slender
corner
spires
above
the
trees
as
a
result
of
the
first
man
norman
william
the
thought
which
held
its
place
the
work
which
did
not
pass
away
had
paid
its
first
man
wages
but
beauties
crumbling
homes
falling
to
waste
were
bitter
things
the
first
man
who
having
won
his
splendid
acres
had
built
his
home
upon
them
and
reared
his
young
and
passed
his
possession
on
with
a
proud
heart
seemed
but
ill
treated
through
centuries
the
home
had
enriched
itself
its
acres
had
borne
harvests
its
trees
had
grown
and
spread
huge
branches
full
lives
had
been
lived
within
the
embrace
of
the
massive
walls
there
had
been
loves
and
lives
and
marriages
and
births
the
breathings
of
them
made
warm
and
full
the
very
air
to
betty
it
seemed
that
the
land
itself
would
have
worn
another
face
if
it
had
not
been
trodden
by
so
many
springing
feet
if
so
many
harvests
had
not
waved
above
it
if
so
many
eyes
had
not
looked
upon
and
loved
it
she
passed
through
variations
of
the
rural
loveliness
she
had
seen
on
her
way
from
the
station
to
the
court
and
felt
them
grow
in
beauty
as
she
saw
them
again
she
came
at
last
to
a
village
somewhat
larger
than
stornham
and
marked
by
the
signs
of
the
lack
of
care
which
stornham
showed
just
beyond
its
limits
a
big
park
gate
opened
on
to
an
avenue
of
massive
trees
she
stopped
and
looked
down
it
but
could
see
nothing
but
its
curves
and
under
the
branches
glimpses
of
a
spacious
sweep
of
park
with
other
trees
standing
in
groups
or
alone
in
the
sward
the
avenue
was
unswept
and
untended
and
here
and
there
boughs
broken
off
by
wind
storms
lay
upon
it
she
turned
to
the
road
again
and
followed
it
because
it
enclosed
the
park
and
she
wanted
to
see
more
of
its
evident
beauty
it
was
very
beautiful
as
she
walked
on
she
saw
it
rolled
into
woods
and
deeps
filled
with
bracken
she
saw
stretches
of
hillocky
rabbit
warren
and
hollows
holding
shadowy
pools
she
caught
the
gleam
of
a
lake
with
swans
sailing
slowly
upon
it
with
curved
necks
there
were
wonderful
lights
and
wonderful
shadows
and
brooding
stillness
which
made
her
footfall
upon
the
road
a
too
material
thing
suddenly
she
heard
a
stirring
in
the
bracken
a
yard
or
two
away
from
her
something
was
moving
slowly
among
the
waving
masses
of
huge
fronds
and
caused
them
to
sway
to
and
fro
it
was
an
antlered
stag
who
rose
from
his
bed
in
the
midst
of
them
and
with
majestic
deliberation
got
upon
his
feet
and
stood
gazing
at
her
with
a
calmness
of
pose
so
splendid
and
a
liquid
darkness
and
lustre
of
eye
so
stilly
and
fearlessly
beautiful
that
she
caught
her
breath
he
simply
gazed
as
her
as
a
great
king
might
gaze
at
an
intruder
scarcely
deigning
wonder
as
she
had
passed
on
her
way
betty
had
seen
that
the
enclosing
park
palings
were
decaying
covered
with
lichen
and
falling
at
intervals
it
had
even
passed
through
her
mind
that
here
was
one
of
the
demands
for
expenditure
on
a
large
estate
which
limited
resources
could
not
confront
with
composure
the
deer
fence
itself
a
thing
of
wire
ten
feet
high
to
form
an
obstacle
to
leaps
she
had
marked
to
be
in
such
condition
as
to
threaten
to
become
shortly
a
useless
thing
until
this
moment
she
had
seen
no
deer
but
looking
beyond
the
stag
and
across
the
sward
she
now
saw
groups
near
each
other
stags
cropping
or
looking
towards
her
with
lifted
heads
does
at
a
respectful
but
affectionate
distance
from
them
some
caring
for
their
fawns
the
stag
who
had
risen
near
her
had
merely
walked
through
a
gap
in
the
boundary
and
now
stood
free
to
go
where
he
would
he
will
get
away
said
betty
knitting
her
black
brows
ah
what
a
shame
even
with
the
best
intentions
one
could
not
give
chase
to
a
stag
she
looked
up
and
down
the
road
but
no
one
was
within
sight
her
brows
continued
to
knit
themselves
and
her
eyes
ranged
over
the
park
itself
in
the
hope
that
some
labourer
on
the
estate
some
woodman
or
might
be
about
it
is
no
affair
of
mine
she
said
but
it
would
be
too
bad
to
let
him
get
away
though
what
happens
to
stray
stags
one
does
exactly
as
she
said
it
she
caught
sight
of
someone
a
man
in
leggings
and
shabby
clothes
and
with
a
gun
over
his
shoulder
evidently
an
under
keeper
he
was
a
big
rather
fellow
but
as
he
lurched
out
into
the
open
from
a
wood
betty
saw
that
she
could
reach
him
if
she
passed
through
a
narrow
gate
a
few
yards
away
and
walked
quickly
he
was
slouching
along
his
head
drooping
and
his
broad
shoulders
expressing
the
definite
antipodes
of
good
spirits
betty
studied
his
back
as
she
strode
after
him
her
conclusion
being
that
he
was
perhaps
not
a
man
to
approach
at
any
time
and
that
this
was
by
ill
luck
one
of
his
less
fortunate
hours
wait
a
moment
if
you
please
her
clear
mellow
voice
flung
out
after
him
when
she
was
within
hearing
distance
i
want
to
speak
to
you
he
turned
with
an
air
of
far
from
pleased
surprise
the
afternoon
sun
was
in
his
eyes
and
made
him
scowl
for
a
moment
he
did
not
see
distinctly
who
was
approaching
him
but
he
had
at
once
recognised
a
certain
cool
tone
of
command
in
the
voice
whose
suddenness
had
roused
him
from
a
black
mood
a
few
steps
brought
them
to
close
quarters
and
when
he
found
himself
looking
into
the
eyes
of
his
pursuer
he
made
a
movement
as
if
to
lift
his
cap
then
checking
himself
touched
it
keeper
fashion
oh
he
said
shortly
miss
vanderpoel
beg
bettina
stood
still
a
second
she
had
her
surprise
also
here
was
the
unexpected
again
the
under
keeper
was
the
passenger
of
the
meridiana
he
did
not
look
pleased
to
see
her
and
the
suddenness
of
his
appearance
excluded
the
possibility
of
her
realising
that
upon
the
whole
she
was
at
least
not
displeased
to
see
him
how
do
you
do
she
said
feeling
the
remark
fantastically
conventional
but
not
being
inspired
by
any
alternative
i
came
to
tell
you
that
one
of
the
stags
has
got
through
a
gap
in
the
damn
she
heard
him
say
under
his
breath
aloud
he
said
thank
he
is
a
splendid
creature
she
said
i
did
not
know
what
to
do
i
was
glad
to
see
a
keeper
thank
you
he
said
again
and
strode
towards
the
place
where
the
stag
still
stood
gazing
up
the
road
as
if
reflecting
as
to
whether
it
allured
him
or
not
betty
walked
back
more
slowly
watching
him
with
interest
she
wondered
what
he
would
find
it
necessary
to
do
she
heard
him
begin
a
low
whistling
and
then
saw
the
antlered
head
turn
towards
him
the
woodland
creature
moved
but
it
was
in
his
direction
it
had
without
doubt
answered
his
call
before
and
knew
its
meaning
to
be
friendly
it
went
towards
him
stretching
out
a
tender
sniffing
nose
and
he
put
his
hand
in
the
pocket
of
his
rough
coat
and
gave
it
something
to
eat
afterwards
he
went
to
the
gap
in
the
fence
and
drew
the
wires
together
fastening
them
with
other
wire
which
he
also
took
out
of
the
coat
pocket
he
is
not
afraid
of
making
himself
useful
thought
betty
and
the
animals
know
him
he
is
not
as
bad
as
he
she
lingered
a
moment
watching
him
and
then
walked
towards
the
gate
through
which
she
had
entered
he
glanced
up
as
she
neared
him
i
do
see
your
carriage
he
said
your
man
is
probably
round
the
i
walked
answered
betty
i
had
heard
of
this
place
and
wanted
to
see
he
stood
up
putting
his
wire
back
into
his
pocket
there
is
not
much
to
be
seen
from
the
road
he
said
would
you
like
to
see
more
of
it
his
manner
was
civil
enough
but
not
the
correct
one
for
a
servant
he
did
not
say
miss
or
touch
his
cap
in
making
the
suggestion
betty
hesitated
a
moment
is
the
family
at
home
she
inquired
there
is
no
family
but
his
lordship
he
is
off
the
does
he
object
to
trespassers
not
if
they
are
respectable
and
take
no
i
am
respectable
and
i
shall
not
take
liberties
said
miss
vanderpoel
with
a
touch
of
hauteur
the
truth
was
that
she
had
spent
a
sufficient
number
of
years
on
the
continent
to
have
become
familiar
with
conventions
which
led
her
not
to
approve
wholly
of
his
bearing
perhaps
he
had
lived
long
enough
in
america
to
forget
such
conventions
and
to
lack
something
which
centuries
of
custom
had
decided
should
belong
to
his
class
a
certain
suggestion
of
rough
force
in
the
man
rather
attracted
her
and
her
slight
distaste
for
his
manner
arose
from
the
realisation
that
a
gentleman
servant
who
did
not
address
his
superiors
as
was
required
by
custom
was
not
doing
his
work
in
a
finished
way
in
his
place
she
knew
her
own
demeanour
would
have
been
finished
if
you
are
sure
that
lord
mount
dunstan
would
not
object
to
my
walking
about
i
should
like
very
much
to
see
the
gardens
and
the
house
she
said
if
you
show
them
to
me
shall
i
be
interfering
with
your
duties
no
he
answered
and
then
for
the
first
time
rather
glumly
added
i
am
interested
she
said
as
they
crossed
the
grass
together
because
places
like
this
are
quite
new
to
me
i
have
never
been
in
england
there
are
not
many
places
like
this
he
answered
not
many
as
old
and
fine
and
not
many
as
nearly
gone
to
ruin
even
stornham
is
not
quite
as
far
it
is
far
gone
said
miss
vanderpoel
i
am
staying
there
with
my
sister
lady
beg
pardon
miss
he
said
this
time
he
touched
his
cap
in
apology
enormous
as
the
gulf
between
their
positions
was
he
knew
that
he
had
offered
to
take
her
over
the
place
because
he
was
in
a
sense
glad
to
see
her
again
why
he
was
glad
he
did
not
profess
to
know
or
even
to
ask
himself
coarsely
speaking
it
might
be
because
she
was
one
of
the
handsomest
young
women
he
had
ever
chanced
to
meet
with
and
while
her
youth
was
apparent
in
the
rich
red
of
her
mouth
the
mass
of
her
thick
soft
hair
and
the
splendid
blue
of
her
eyes
there
spoke
in
every
line
of
face
and
pose
something
intensely
more
interesting
and
compelling
than
girlhood
also
since
the
night
they
had
come
together
on
the
ship
deck
for
an
appalling
moment
he
had
liked
her
better
and
rebelled
less
against
the
unnatural
wealth
she
represented
he
led
her
first
to
the
wood
from
which
she
had
seen
him
emerge
i
will
show
you
this
first
he
explained
keep
your
eyes
on
the
ground
until
i
tell
you
to
raise
odd
as
this
was
she
obeyed
and
her
lowered
glance
showed
her
that
she
was
being
guided
along
a
narrow
path
between
trees
the
light
was
mellow
and
birds
were
singing
in
the
boughs
above
her
in
a
few
minutes
he
stopped
now
look
up
he
said
she
uttered
an
exclamation
when
she
did
so
she
was
in
a
fairy
dell
thick
with
ferns
and
at
beautiful
distances
from
each
other
incredibly
splendid
oaks
spread
and
almost
trailed
their
lovely
giant
branches
the
glow
shining
through
and
between
them
the
shadows
beneath
them
their
great
boles
and
roots
and
the
stately
mellow
distances
revealed
under
their
branches
the
ancient
wildness
and
richness
which
meant
after
all
centuries
of
cultivation
made
a
picture
in
this
exact
perfect
moment
of
ripening
afternoon
sun
of
an
almost
unbelievable
beauty
there
is
nothing
lovelier
he
said
in
a
low
voice
in
all
bettina
turned
to
look
at
him
because
his
tone
was
a
curious
one
for
a
man
like
himself
he
was
standing
resting
on
his
gun
and
taking
in
the
loveliness
with
a
strange
look
in
his
rugged
face
you
you
love
it
she
said
yes
but
with
a
suggestion
of
stubborn
reluctance
in
the
admission
she
was
rather
moved
have
you
been
keeper
here
long
she
asked
no
only
a
few
years
but
i
have
known
the
place
all
my
does
lord
mount
dunstan
love
it
in
his
way
he
was
plainly
not
disposed
to
talk
of
his
master
he
was
perhaps
not
on
particularly
good
terms
with
him
he
led
her
away
and
volunteered
no
further
information
he
was
upon
the
whole
uncommunicative
he
did
not
once
refer
to
the
circumstance
of
their
having
met
before
it
was
plain
that
he
had
no
intention
of
presuming
upon
the
fact
that
he
as
a
passenger
on
a
ship
had
once
been
forced
by
accident
across
the
barriers
between
himself
and
the
saloon
deck
he
was
stubbornly
resolved
to
keep
his
place
so
stubbornly
that
bettina
felt
that
to
broach
the
subject
herself
would
verge
upon
offence
but
the
golden
ways
through
which
he
led
her
made
the
afternoon
one
she
knew
she
should
never
forget
they
wandered
through
moss
walks
and
alleys
through
tangled
shrubberies
bursting
into
bloom
beneath
avenues
of
blossoming
and
scented
limes
between
thickets
of
budding
red
and
white
may
and
jungles
of
neglected
rhododendrons
through
sunken
gardens
and
walled
ones
past
terraces
with
broken
balustrades
of
stone
and
fallen
floras
and
dianas
past
fountains
splashing
in
lovely
corners
arches
overgrown
with
yet
unblooming
roses
crumbled
in
their
time
stained
beauty
stillness
brooded
over
it
all
and
they
met
no
one
they
scarcely
broke
the
silence
themselves
the
man
led
the
way
as
one
who
knew
it
by
heart
and
bettina
followed
not
caring
for
speech
herself
because
the
stillness
seemed
to
add
a
spell
of
enchantment
what
could
one
say
to
a
stranger
of
such
beauty
so
lost
and
given
over
to
ruin
and
decay
but
oh
she
murmured
once
standing
still
with
indrawn
breath
if
it
were
mine
if
it
were
mine
and
she
said
the
thing
forgetting
that
her
guide
was
a
living
creature
and
stood
near
afterwards
her
memories
of
it
all
seemed
to
her
like
the
memories
of
a
dream
the
lack
of
speech
between
herself
and
the
man
who
led
her
his
often
averted
face
her
own
sense
of
the
desertedness
of
each
beauteous
spot
she
passed
through
the
mossy
paths
which
gave
back
no
sound
of
footfalls
as
they
walked
suggested
one
and
all
unreality
when
at
last
they
passed
through
a
door
half
hidden
in
an
ivied
wall
and
crossing
a
grassed
bowling
green
mounted
a
short
flight
of
broken
steps
which
led
them
to
a
point
through
which
they
saw
the
house
through
a
break
in
the
trees
this
last
was
the
final
touch
of
all
it
was
a
great
place
stately
in
its
masses
of
grey
stone
to
which
thick
ivy
clung
to
bettina
it
seemed
that
a
hundred
windows
stared
at
her
with
closed
blind
eyes
all
were
shuttered
but
two
or
three
on
the
lower
floors
not
one
showed
signs
of
life
the
silent
stone
thing
stood
sightless
among
all
of
which
it
was
dead
master
rolling
acres
great
trees
lost
gardens
and
deserted
groves
oh
she
sighed
oh
her
companion
stood
still
and
leaned
upon
his
gun
again
looking
as
he
had
looked
before
some
of
it
he
said
was
here
before
the
conquest
it
belonged
to
mount
dunstans
and
only
one
of
them
is
left
she
cried
and
it
is
like
this
they
have
been
a
bad
lot
the
last
hundred
years
was
the
surly
liberty
of
speech
he
took
a
bad
it
was
not
his
place
to
speak
in
such
manner
of
those
of
his
house
and
it
was
not
the
part
of
miss
vanderpoel
to
encourage
him
by
response
she
remained
silent
standing
perhaps
a
trifle
more
lightly
erect
as
she
gazed
at
the
rows
of
blind
windows
in
silence
neither
of
them
uttered
a
word
for
some
time
but
at
length
bettina
roused
herself
she
had
a
walk
before
her
and
must
go
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
she
began
and
then
paused
a
second
a
curious
hesitance
came
upon
her
though
she
knew
that
under
ordinary
circumstances
such
hesitation
would
have
been
totally
out
of
place
she
had
occupied
the
man
time
for
an
hour
or
more
he
was
of
the
working
class
and
one
must
not
be
guilty
of
the
error
of
imagining
that
a
man
who
has
work
to
do
can
justly
spend
his
time
in
one
service
for
the
mere
pleasure
of
it
she
knew
what
custom
demanded
why
should
she
hesitate
before
this
man
with
his
not
too
courteous
surly
face
she
felt
slightly
irritated
by
her
own
unpractical
embarrassment
as
she
put
her
hand
into
the
small
latched
bag
at
her
belt
i
am
very
much
obliged
keeper
she
said
you
have
given
me
a
great
deal
of
your
time
you
know
the
place
so
well
that
it
has
been
a
pleasure
to
be
taken
about
by
you
i
have
never
seen
anything
so
beautiful
and
so
sad
thank
you
thank
and
she
put
a
goldpiece
in
his
palm
his
fingers
closed
over
it
quietly
why
it
was
to
her
great
relief
she
did
not
know
because
something
in
the
simple
act
annoyed
her
even
while
she
congratulated
herself
that
her
hesitance
had
been
absurd
the
next
moment
she
wondered
if
it
could
be
possible
that
he
had
expected
a
larger
fee
he
opened
his
hand
and
looked
at
the
money
with
a
grim
steadiness
thank
you
miss
he
said
and
touched
his
cap
in
the
proper
manner
he
did
not
look
gracious
or
grateful
but
he
began
to
put
it
in
a
small
pocket
in
the
breast
of
his
worn
corduroy
shooting
jacket
suddenly
he
stopped
as
if
with
abrupt
resolve
he
handed
the
coin
back
without
any
change
of
his
glum
look
hang
it
all
he
said
i
ca
take
this
you
know
i
suppose
i
ought
to
have
told
you
it
would
have
been
less
awkward
for
us
both
i
am
that
unfortunate
beggar
mount
dunstan
a
pause
was
inevitable
it
was
a
rather
long
one
after
it
betty
took
back
her
and
returned
it
to
her
bag
but
she
pleased
a
certain
perversity
in
him
by
looking
more
annoyed
than
confused
yes
she
said
you
ought
to
have
told
me
lord
mount
he
slightly
shrugged
his
big
shoulders
why
should
you
take
me
for
a
keeper
you
crossed
the
atlantic
with
a
looking
fellow
separated
from
you
by
barriers
of
wood
and
iron
you
came
upon
him
tramping
over
a
nobleman
estate
in
shabby
corduroys
and
gaiters
with
a
gun
over
his
shoulder
and
a
scowl
on
his
ugly
face
why
should
you
leap
to
the
conclusion
that
he
is
the
belted
earl
himself
there
is
no
cause
for
i
am
not
embarrassed
said
bettina
that
is
what
i
like
gruffly
i
am
pleased
in
her
mellowest
velvet
voice
that
you
like
their
eyes
met
with
a
singular
directness
of
gaze
between
them
a
spark
passed
which
was
not
afterwards
to
be
extinguished
though
neither
of
them
knew
the
moment
of
its
kindling
and
mount
dunstan
slightly
frowned
i
beg
pardon
he
said
you
are
quite
right
it
had
a
deucedly
patronising
as
he
stood
before
her
betty
was
given
her
opportunity
to
see
him
as
she
had
not
seen
him
before
to
confront
the
sum
total
of
his
physique
his
eyes
looked
out
from
rather
fine
heavy
brows
his
features
were
strong
and
clear
though
ruggedly
cut
his
build
showed
weight
of
bone
not
of
flesh
and
his
limbs
were
big
and
long
he
would
have
wielded
a
with
power
in
centuries
in
which
men
hewed
their
way
with
them
also
it
occurred
to
her
he
would
have
looked
well
in
a
coat
of
mail
he
did
not
look
ill
in
his
corduroys
and
gaiters
i
am
a
beggar
he
went
on
i
had
been
slouching
about
the
place
almost
driven
mad
by
my
thoughts
and
when
i
saw
you
took
me
for
a
servant
my
fancy
was
for
letting
the
thing
go
on
if
i
had
been
a
rich
man
instead
of
a
pauper
i
would
have
kept
your
i
should
not
have
enjoyed
that
when
i
found
out
the
truth
said
miss
vanderpoel
no
i
suppose
you
would
but
i
should
not
have
he
was
looking
at
her
straightly
and
summing
her
up
as
she
had
summed
him
up
a
man
and
young
he
did
not
miss
a
line
or
a
tint
of
her
chin
or
cheek
shoulder
or
brow
or
dense
lifted
hair
he
had
already
even
in
his
guise
of
keeper
noticed
one
thing
which
was
that
while
at
times
her
eyes
were
the
blue
of
steel
sometimes
they
melted
to
the
colour
of
bluebells
under
water
they
had
been
of
this
last
hue
when
she
had
stood
in
the
sunken
garden
forgetting
him
and
crying
low
oh
if
it
were
mine
if
it
were
mine
he
did
not
like
american
women
with
millions
but
while
he
would
not
have
said
that
he
liked
her
he
did
not
wish
her
yet
to
move
away
and
she
too
did
not
wish
just
yet
to
move
away
there
was
something
dramatic
and
absorbing
in
the
situation
she
looked
over
the
softly
stirring
grass
and
saw
the
sunshine
was
deepening
its
gold
and
the
shadows
were
growing
long
it
was
not
a
habit
of
hers
to
ask
questions
but
she
asked
one
did
you
not
like
america
was
what
she
said
hated
it
hated
it
i
went
there
lured
by
a
belief
that
a
man
like
myself
with
muscle
and
will
even
without
experience
could
make
a
fortune
out
of
small
capital
on
a
sheep
ranch
wind
and
weather
and
disease
played
the
devil
with
me
i
lost
the
little
i
had
and
came
back
to
begin
over
again
on
nothing
here
and
he
waved
his
hand
over
the
park
with
its
sward
and
coppice
and
bracken
and
the
deer
cropping
in
the
late
afternoon
gold
to
begin
what
again
said
betty
it
was
an
extraordinary
enough
thing
seen
in
the
light
of
conventions
that
they
should
stand
and
talk
like
this
but
the
spark
had
kindled
between
eye
and
eye
and
because
of
it
they
suddenly
had
forgotten
that
they
were
strangers
you
are
an
american
so
it
may
not
seem
as
mad
to
you
as
it
would
to
others
to
begin
to
build
up
again
in
one
man
life
what
has
taken
centuries
to
grow
and
fall
into
it
would
be
a
splendid
thing
to
do
she
said
slowly
and
as
she
said
it
her
eyes
took
on
their
colour
of
bluebells
because
what
she
had
seen
had
moved
her
she
had
not
looked
at
him
but
at
the
cropping
deer
as
she
spoke
but
at
her
next
sentence
she
turned
to
him
again
where
should
you
begin
she
asked
and
in
saying
it
thought
of
stornham
he
laughed
shortly
that
is
american
enough
he
said
your
people
have
not
finished
their
beginnings
yet
and
live
in
the
spirit
of
them
i
tell
you
of
a
wild
fancy
and
you
accept
it
as
a
possibility
and
turn
on
me
with
should
you
begin
that
is
one
way
of
beginning
said
bettina
in
fact
it
is
the
only
he
did
not
tell
her
that
he
liked
that
but
he
knew
that
he
did
like
it
and
that
her
mere
words
touched
him
like
a
spur
it
was
of
course
her
lifelong
breathing
of
the
atmosphere
of
millions
which
made
for
this
fashion
of
moving
at
once
in
the
direction
of
obstacles
presenting
to
the
rest
of
the
world
barriers
seemingly
insurmountable
and
yet
there
was
something
else
in
it
some
quality
of
nature
which
did
not
alone
suggest
the
omnipotence
of
wealth
but
another
thing
which
might
be
even
stronger
and
therefore
carried
conviction
he
who
had
raged
and
clenched
his
hands
in
the
face
of
his
knowledge
of
the
aspect
his
dream
would
have
presented
if
he
had
revealed
it
to
the
ordinary
practical
mind
felt
that
a
point
of
view
like
this
was
good
for
him
there
was
in
it
stimulus
for
a
fleeting
moment
at
least
that
is
a
good
idea
he
answered
where
should
you
begin
she
replied
quite
seriously
though
he
could
have
imagined
some
girls
rather
simpering
over
the
question
as
a
casual
joke
one
would
begin
at
the
fences
she
said
do
you
think
so
that
is
that
is
where
i
shall
begin
at
stornham
reflectively
you
are
going
to
begin
at
stornham
how
could
one
help
it
it
is
not
as
large
or
as
splendid
as
this
has
been
but
it
is
like
it
in
a
way
and
it
will
belong
to
my
sister
son
no
i
could
not
help
i
suppose
you
could
there
was
a
hint
of
wholly
unconscious
resentment
in
his
tone
he
was
thinking
that
the
effect
produced
by
their
boundless
wealth
was
to
make
these
people
feel
as
a
race
of
giants
might
even
their
women
unknowingly
revealed
it
no
i
could
not
was
her
reply
i
suppose
i
am
on
the
whole
a
sort
of
commercial
working
person
i
have
no
doubt
it
is
commercial
that
instinct
which
makes
one
resent
seeing
things
lose
their
shall
you
begin
it
for
that
reason
partly
for
that
one
partly
for
she
held
out
her
hand
to
him
look
at
the
length
of
the
shadows
i
must
go
thank
you
lord
mount
dunstan
for
showing
me
the
place
and
thank
you
for
undeceiving
he
held
the
side
gate
open
for
her
and
lifted
his
cap
as
she
passed
through
he
admitted
to
himself
with
some
reluctance
that
he
was
not
content
that
she
should
go
even
yet
but
of
course
she
must
go
there
passed
through
his
mind
a
remote
wonder
why
he
had
suddenly
unbosomed
himself
to
her
in
a
way
so
extraordinarily
unlike
himself
it
was
he
thought
next
because
as
he
had
taken
her
about
from
one
place
to
another
he
had
known
that
she
had
seen
in
things
what
he
had
seen
in
them
so
long
the
melancholy
loneliness
the
significance
of
it
the
lost
hopes
that
lay
behind
it
the
touching
pain
of
the
stateliness
wrecked
she
had
shown
it
in
the
way
in
which
she
tenderly
looked
from
side
to
side
in
the
very
lightness
of
her
footfall
in
the
bluebell
softening
of
her
eyes
oh
yes
she
had
understood
and
cared
american
as
she
was
she
had
felt
it
all
even
with
her
hideous
background
of
fifth
avenue
behind
her
when
he
had
spoken
it
had
been
in
involuntary
response
to
an
emotion
in
herself
so
he
stood
thinking
as
he
for
some
time
watched
her
walking
up
the
road
chapter
xvi
the
particular
incident
betty
vanderpoel
walk
back
to
stornham
did
not
long
though
it
was
give
her
time
to
follow
to
its
end
the
thread
of
her
thoughts
mentally
she
walked
again
with
her
uncommunicative
guide
through
woodpaths
and
gardens
and
stood
gazing
at
the
great
house
she
had
not
given
the
man
more
than
an
occasional
glance
until
he
had
told
her
his
name
she
had
been
too
much
absorbed
too
much
moved
by
what
she
had
been
seeing
she
wondered
if
she
had
been
more
aware
of
him
whether
his
face
would
have
revealed
a
great
deal
she
believed
it
would
not
he
had
made
himself
outwardly
stolid
but
the
thing
must
have
been
bitter
to
him
the
whole
story
of
the
splendid
past
was
familiar
even
if
through
his
own
life
he
had
looked
on
only
at
gradual
decay
there
must
be
stories
enough
of
men
and
women
who
had
lived
in
the
place
of
what
they
had
done
of
how
they
had
loved
of
what
they
had
counted
for
in
their
country
wars
and
peacemakings
great
functions
and
to
be
able
to
look
back
through
centuries
and
know
of
one
blood
that
sometimes
it
had
been
shed
in
the
doing
of
great
deeds
must
be
a
thing
to
remember
to
realise
that
the
courage
and
honour
had
been
lost
in
ignoble
modern
vices
which
no
sense
of
dignity
and
reverence
for
race
and
name
had
restrained
must
be
bitter
bitter
and
in
the
role
of
a
servant
to
lead
a
stranger
about
among
the
ruins
of
what
had
been
that
must
have
been
bitter
too
for
a
moment
betty
felt
the
bitterness
of
it
herself
and
her
red
mouth
took
upon
itself
a
grim
line
the
worst
of
it
for
him
was
that
he
was
not
of
that
strain
of
his
race
who
had
been
the
bad
the
bad
lot
had
been
the
weak
lot
the
vicious
the
scandals
which
had
shut
men
out
from
their
class
and
kind
were
usually
of
an
ugly
type
this
man
had
a
strong
jaw
a
powerful
healthy
body
and
clean
though
perhaps
hard
eyes
the
first
man
of
them
who
hewed
his
way
to
the
front
who
stood
fierce
in
the
face
of
things
who
won
the
first
lands
and
laid
the
first
stones
might
have
been
like
him
in
build
and
look
it
a
disgusting
thing
she
said
to
herself
to
think
of
the
corrupt
weaklings
the
strong
ones
dwindled
down
to
i
hate
them
so
does
there
had
been
many
such
of
late
years
she
knew
she
had
seen
them
in
paris
in
rome
even
in
new
york
things
with
thin
or
bodies
and
receding
chins
and
foreheads
things
haunting
places
of
amusement
and
finding
inordinate
entertainment
in
strange
jokes
and
horseplay
she
herself
had
hot
blood
and
a
fierce
strength
of
rebellion
and
she
was
wondering
how
if
the
father
and
elder
brother
had
been
the
bad
lot
he
had
managed
to
stand
still
looking
on
and
keeping
his
hands
off
them
the
last
gold
of
the
sun
was
mellowing
the
grey
stone
of
the
terrace
and
enriching
the
green
of
the
weeds
thrusting
themselves
into
life
between
the
uneven
flags
when
she
reached
stornham
and
passing
through
the
house
found
lady
anstruthers
sitting
there
in
sustenance
of
her
effort
to
keep
up
appearances
she
had
put
on
a
weird
little
muslin
dress
and
had
elaborated
the
dressing
of
her
thin
hair
it
was
no
longer
dragged
back
straight
from
her
face
and
she
looked
a
trifle
less
abject
even
a
shade
prettier
bettina
sat
upon
the
edge
of
the
balustrade
and
touched
the
hair
with
light
fingers
ruffling
it
a
little
becomingly
if
you
had
worn
it
like
this
yesterday
she
said
i
should
have
known
should
you
betty
i
never
look
into
a
mirror
if
i
can
help
it
but
when
i
do
i
never
know
myself
the
thing
that
stares
back
at
me
with
its
pale
eyes
is
not
rosy
but
of
course
everyone
grows
not
now
people
are
just
discovering
how
to
grow
young
lady
anstruthers
looked
into
the
clear
courage
of
her
laughing
eyes
somehow
she
said
you
say
strange
things
in
such
a
way
that
one
feels
as
if
they
must
be
true
however
however
unlike
anything
else
they
they
are
not
as
new
as
they
seem
said
betty
ancient
philosophers
said
things
like
them
centuries
ago
but
people
did
not
believe
them
we
are
just
beginning
to
drag
them
out
of
the
dust
and
furbish
them
up
and
pretend
they
are
ours
just
as
people
rub
up
and
adorn
themselves
with
jewels
dug
out
of
in
america
people
think
so
many
new
things
said
poor
little
lady
anstruthers
with
yearning
humbleness
the
whole
civilised
world
is
thinking
what
you
call
new
things
said
betty
the
old
ones
wo
do
they
have
been
tried
and
though
they
have
helped
us
to
the
place
we
have
reached
they
can
not
help
us
any
farther
we
must
begin
it
is
such
a
long
time
since
i
began
said
rosy
such
a
long
then
there
must
be
another
beginning
for
you
too
the
hour
has
lady
anstruthers
rose
with
as
involuntary
a
movement
as
if
a
strong
hand
had
drawn
her
to
her
feet
she
stood
facing
betty
a
pathetic
little
figure
in
her
muslin
frock
and
with
her
face
and
eyes
and
being
though
on
her
faded
cheeks
a
flush
was
rising
oh
betty
she
said
i
do
know
what
there
is
about
you
but
there
is
something
which
makes
one
feel
as
if
you
believed
everything
and
could
do
everything
and
as
if
one
believes
you
whatever
you
were
to
say
you
would
make
it
seem
true
if
you
said
the
wildest
thing
in
the
world
i
should
believe
betty
got
up
too
and
there
was
an
extraordinary
steadiness
in
her
eyes
you
may
she
answered
i
shall
never
say
one
thing
to
you
which
is
not
a
truth
not
one
single
i
believe
that
said
rosy
anstruthers
with
a
quivering
mouth
i
do
believe
it
i
walked
to
mount
dunstan
betty
said
later
really
said
rosy
there
and
back
yes
and
all
round
the
park
and
the
rosy
looked
rather
uncertain
were
you
a
little
afraid
of
meeting
someone
i
did
meet
someone
at
first
i
took
him
for
a
gamekeeper
but
he
turned
out
to
be
lord
mount
lady
anstruthers
gasped
what
did
he
do
she
exclaimed
did
he
look
angry
at
seeing
a
stranger
they
say
he
is
so
and
i
should
feel
if
i
were
in
his
place
said
betty
he
has
enough
to
rouse
his
evil
passions
and
make
him
savage
what
a
fate
for
a
man
with
any
sense
and
decency
of
feeling
what
fools
and
criminals
the
last
generation
of
his
house
must
have
produced
i
wonder
how
such
things
evolve
themselves
but
he
is
different
different
one
can
see
it
if
he
had
a
chance
just
half
a
chance
he
would
build
it
all
up
again
and
i
do
mean
merely
the
place
but
all
that
one
means
when
one
says
house
he
would
need
a
great
deal
of
money
sighed
lady
anstruthers
betty
nodded
slowly
as
she
looked
out
reflecting
into
the
park
yes
it
would
require
money
was
her
admission
and
he
has
none
lady
anstruthers
added
none
he
will
get
some
said
betty
still
reflecting
he
will
make
it
or
dig
it
up
or
someone
will
leave
it
to
him
there
is
a
great
deal
of
money
in
the
world
and
when
a
strong
creature
ought
to
have
some
of
it
he
gets
oh
betty
said
rosy
oh
betty
watch
that
man
said
betty
you
will
see
it
will
lady
anstruthers
mind
working
at
no
time
on
complex
lines
presented
her
with
a
simple
modern
solution
perhaps
he
will
marry
an
american
she
said
and
saying
it
sighed
again
he
will
not
do
it
on
bettina
answered
slowly
and
with
such
an
air
of
absence
of
mind
that
rosy
laughed
a
little
will
he
do
it
accidentally
or
against
his
will
she
said
betty
herself
smiled
perhaps
he
will
she
said
there
are
englishmen
who
rather
dislike
americans
i
think
he
is
one
of
it
apparently
became
necessary
for
lady
anstruthers
a
moment
later
to
lean
upon
the
stone
balustrade
and
pick
off
a
young
leaf
or
so
for
no
reason
whatever
unless
that
in
doing
so
she
averted
her
look
from
her
sister
as
she
made
her
next
remark
are
you
when
are
you
going
to
write
to
father
and
mother
i
have
written
with
unembarrassed
evenness
of
tone
mother
will
be
counting
the
mother
rosy
breathed
with
a
soft
little
gasp
mother
and
turned
her
face
farther
away
what
did
you
tell
her
betty
moved
over
to
her
and
stood
close
at
her
side
the
power
of
her
personality
enveloped
the
tremulous
creature
as
if
it
had
been
a
sense
of
warmth
i
told
her
how
beautiful
the
place
was
and
how
ughtred
adored
you
and
how
you
loved
us
all
and
longed
to
see
new
york
the
relief
in
the
poor
little
face
was
so
immense
that
betty
heart
shook
before
it
lady
anstruthers
looked
up
at
her
with
adoring
eyes
i
might
have
known
she
said
i
might
have
known
that
that
you
would
only
say
the
right
thing
you
could
say
the
wrong
thing
betty
bent
over
her
and
spoke
almost
yearningly
whatever
happens
she
said
we
will
take
care
that
mother
is
not
hurt
she
too
kind
she
too
good
she
too
that
is
what
i
have
remembered
said
lady
anstruthers
brokenly
she
used
to
hold
me
on
her
lap
when
i
was
quite
grown
up
oh
her
soft
warm
arms
her
warm
shoulder
i
have
so
wanted
she
has
wanted
you
betty
answered
she
thinks
of
you
just
as
she
did
when
she
held
you
on
her
but
if
she
saw
me
now
looking
like
this
if
she
saw
me
sometimes
i
have
even
been
glad
to
think
she
never
she
betty
tone
was
cool
and
clear
but
before
she
does
i
shall
have
made
you
look
like
lady
anstruthers
thin
hand
closed
on
her
plucked
leaves
convulsively
and
then
opening
let
them
drop
upon
the
stone
of
the
terrace
we
shall
never
see
each
other
it
would
be
possible
she
said
and
there
is
no
magic
in
the
world
now
betty
you
ca
bring
back
yes
you
can
said
bettina
and
what
used
to
be
called
magic
is
only
the
controlled
working
of
the
law
and
order
of
things
in
these
days
we
must
talk
it
all
lady
anstruthers
became
a
little
pale
what
she
asked
low
and
nervously
and
betty
saw
her
glance
sideways
at
the
windows
of
the
room
which
opened
on
to
the
terrace
betty
took
her
hand
and
drew
her
down
into
a
chair
she
sat
near
her
and
looked
her
straight
in
the
face
do
be
frightened
she
said
i
tell
you
there
is
no
need
to
be
frightened
we
are
not
living
in
the
middle
ages
there
is
a
policeman
even
in
stornham
village
and
we
are
within
four
hours
of
london
where
there
are
lady
anstruthers
tried
to
laugh
but
did
not
succeed
very
well
and
her
forehead
flushed
i
do
quite
know
why
i
seem
so
nervous
she
said
it
very
silly
of
she
was
still
timid
enough
to
cling
to
some
rag
of
pretence
but
betty
knew
that
it
would
fall
away
she
did
the
wisest
possible
thing
which
was
to
make
an
apparently
impersonal
remark
i
want
you
to
go
over
the
place
with
me
and
show
me
everything
walls
and
fences
and
greenhouses
and
outbuildings
must
not
be
allowed
to
crumble
what
cried
rosy
have
you
seen
all
that
already
she
actually
stared
at
her
how
practical
and
and
american
to
see
that
a
wall
has
fallen
when
you
find
yourself
obliged
to
walk
round
a
pile
of
brickwork
said
betty
lady
anstruthers
still
softly
stared
what
what
are
you
thinking
of
she
asked
thinking
that
it
is
all
too
beautiful
betty
look
swept
the
loveliness
spread
about
her
too
beautiful
and
too
valuable
to
be
allowed
to
lose
its
value
and
its
she
turned
her
eyes
back
to
rosy
and
the
deep
dimple
near
her
mouth
showed
itself
delightfully
it
is
a
throwing
away
of
capital
she
added
oh
cried
lady
anstruthers
how
clever
you
are
and
you
look
so
different
do
i
look
stupid
the
dimple
deepening
i
must
try
to
alter
do
try
to
alter
your
looks
said
rosy
it
is
your
looks
that
make
you
so
so
wonderful
but
usually
women
girls
rosy
paused
oh
i
have
been
trained
laughed
betty
i
am
the
spoiled
daughter
of
a
business
man
of
genius
his
business
is
an
art
and
a
science
i
have
had
advantages
he
has
let
me
hear
him
talk
i
even
know
some
trifling
things
about
stocks
not
enough
to
do
me
vital
injury
but
something
what
i
know
best
of
all
her
laugh
ended
and
her
eyes
changed
their
look
is
that
it
is
a
blunder
to
think
that
beauty
is
not
capital
that
happiness
is
not
and
that
both
are
not
the
greatest
assets
in
the
scheme
this
with
a
wave
of
her
hand
taking
in
all
they
saw
is
beauty
and
it
ought
to
be
happiness
and
it
must
be
taken
care
of
it
is
your
home
and
ughtred
it
is
nigel
put
in
rosy
it
is
entailed
is
it
turning
quickly
he
can
not
sell
it
if
he
could
we
should
not
be
sitting
here
ruefully
then
he
can
not
object
to
its
being
rescued
from
he
will
object
to
to
money
being
spent
on
things
he
does
not
care
lady
anstruthers
voice
lowered
itself
as
it
always
did
when
she
spoke
of
her
husband
and
she
indulged
in
the
involuntary
hasty
glance
about
her
i
am
going
to
my
room
to
take
off
my
hat
betty
said
will
you
come
with
me
she
went
into
the
house
talking
quietly
of
ordinary
things
and
in
this
way
they
mounted
the
stairway
together
and
passed
along
the
gallery
which
led
to
her
room
when
they
entered
it
she
closed
the
door
locked
it
and
taking
off
her
hat
laid
it
aside
after
doing
which
she
sat
no
one
can
hear
and
no
one
can
come
in
she
said
and
if
they
could
you
are
afraid
of
things
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
now
tell
me
what
happened
when
you
were
so
ill
after
ughtred
was
you
guessed
that
it
happened
then
gasped
lady
anstruthers
it
was
a
good
time
to
make
anything
happen
replied
bettina
you
were
prostrated
you
were
a
child
and
felt
yourself
cast
off
hopelessly
from
the
people
who
loved
forever
forever
lady
anstruthers
voice
was
a
sharp
little
moan
that
was
what
i
felt
that
nothing
could
ever
help
me
i
dared
not
write
things
he
told
me
he
would
not
have
it
that
he
would
stop
any
hysterical
complaints
that
his
mother
could
testify
that
he
behaved
perfectly
to
me
she
was
the
only
person
in
the
room
with
us
when
when
when
said
betty
lady
anstruthers
shuddered
she
leaned
forward
and
caught
betty
hand
between
her
own
shaking
ones
he
struck
me
he
struck
me
he
said
it
never
happened
but
it
did
it
did
betty
it
did
that
was
the
one
thing
that
came
back
to
me
clearest
he
said
that
i
was
in
delirious
hysterics
and
that
i
had
struggled
with
his
mother
and
himself
because
they
tried
to
keep
me
quiet
and
prevent
the
servants
hearing
one
awful
day
he
brought
lady
anstruthers
into
the
room
and
they
stood
over
me
as
i
lay
in
bed
and
she
fixed
her
eyes
on
me
and
said
that
she
being
an
englishwoman
and
a
person
whose
word
would
be
believed
could
tell
people
the
truth
my
father
and
mother
if
necessary
that
my
spoiled
hysterical
american
tempers
had
created
unhappiness
for
me
merely
because
i
was
bored
by
life
in
the
country
and
wanted
excitement
i
tried
to
answer
but
they
would
not
let
me
and
when
i
began
to
shake
all
over
they
said
that
i
was
throwing
myself
into
hysterics
again
and
they
told
the
doctor
so
and
he
believed
the
possibilities
of
the
situation
were
plainly
to
be
seen
fate
in
the
form
of
temperament
itself
had
been
against
her
it
was
clear
enough
to
betty
as
she
patted
and
stroked
the
thin
hands
i
understand
tell
me
the
rest
she
said
lady
anstruthers
head
dropped
when
i
was
loneliest
and
dying
of
homesickness
and
so
weak
that
i
could
not
speak
without
sobbing
he
came
to
me
it
was
one
morning
after
i
had
been
lying
awake
all
night
and
he
began
to
seem
kinder
he
had
not
been
near
me
for
two
days
and
i
had
thought
i
was
going
to
be
left
to
die
alone
and
mother
would
never
know
he
said
he
had
been
reflecting
and
that
he
was
afraid
that
we
had
misunderstood
each
other
because
we
belonged
to
different
countries
and
had
been
brought
up
in
different
ways
she
paused
and
that
if
you
understood
his
position
and
considered
it
you
might
both
be
quite
happy
betty
gave
in
quiet
termination
lady
anstruthers
started
oh
you
know
it
all
she
exclaimed
only
because
i
have
heard
it
before
it
is
an
old
trick
and
because
he
seemed
kind
and
relenting
you
tried
to
understand
and
signed
i
wanted
to
understand
i
wanted
to
believe
what
did
it
matter
which
of
us
had
the
money
if
we
liked
each
other
and
were
happy
he
told
me
things
about
the
estate
and
about
the
enormous
cost
of
it
and
his
bad
luck
and
debts
he
could
not
help
and
i
said
that
i
would
do
anything
if
if
we
could
only
be
like
mother
and
father
and
he
kissed
me
and
i
signed
the
and
then
he
went
to
london
the
next
day
and
then
to
paris
he
said
he
was
obliged
to
go
on
business
he
was
away
a
month
and
after
a
week
had
passed
lady
anstruthers
began
to
be
restless
and
angry
and
once
she
flew
into
a
rage
and
told
me
i
was
a
fool
and
that
if
i
had
been
an
englishwoman
i
should
have
had
some
decent
control
over
my
husband
because
he
would
have
respected
me
in
time
i
found
out
what
i
had
done
it
did
not
take
the
paper
you
signed
said
betty
gave
him
control
over
your
money
a
forlorn
nod
was
the
answer
and
since
then
he
has
done
as
he
chose
and
he
has
not
chosen
to
care
for
stornham
and
once
he
made
you
write
to
father
to
ask
for
more
money
i
did
it
once
i
never
would
do
it
again
he
has
tried
to
make
me
he
always
says
it
is
to
save
stornham
for
nothing
can
take
stornham
from
ughtred
it
may
come
to
him
a
ruin
but
it
will
come
to
he
says
there
are
legal
points
i
can
not
understand
and
he
says
he
is
spending
money
on
where
he
does
go
into
that
if
i
were
to
ask
questions
he
would
make
me
know
that
i
had
better
stop
he
says
i
know
nothing
about
things
and
he
is
right
he
has
never
allowed
me
to
know
and
and
i
am
not
like
you
when
you
signed
the
paper
you
did
not
realise
that
you
were
doing
something
you
could
never
undo
and
that
you
would
be
forced
to
submit
to
the
consequences
i
i
did
realise
anything
but
that
it
would
kill
me
to
live
as
i
had
been
living
feeling
as
if
they
hated
me
and
i
was
so
glad
and
thankful
that
he
seemed
kinder
it
was
as
if
i
had
been
on
the
rack
and
he
turned
the
screws
back
and
i
was
ready
to
do
anything
anything
if
i
might
be
taken
off
oh
betty
you
know
do
you
that
that
if
he
would
only
have
been
a
little
kind
just
a
little
i
would
have
obeyed
him
always
and
given
him
betty
sat
and
looked
at
her
with
deeply
pondering
eyes
she
was
confronting
the
fact
that
it
seemed
possible
that
one
must
build
a
new
soul
for
her
as
well
as
a
new
body
in
these
days
of
science
and
growing
sanity
of
thought
one
did
not
stand
helpless
before
the
problem
of
physical
rebuilding
and
and
perhaps
if
one
could
pour
life
into
a
creature
the
soul
of
it
would
respond
and
wake
again
and
grow
you
do
not
know
where
he
is
she
said
aloud
you
absolutely
do
not
know
i
never
know
exactly
lady
anstruthers
answered
he
was
here
for
a
few
days
the
week
before
you
came
he
said
he
was
going
abroad
he
might
appear
i
might
not
hear
of
him
for
six
months
i
ca
help
hoping
now
that
it
will
be
the
six
why
particularly
now
inquired
betty
lady
anstruthers
flushed
and
looked
shy
and
awkward
because
of
you
i
do
know
what
he
would
say
i
do
know
what
he
would
to
me
said
betty
it
would
be
sure
to
be
something
unreasonable
and
wicked
said
lady
anstruthers
it
would
i
wonder
what
it
would
be
betty
said
musingly
he
has
told
lies
for
years
to
keep
you
all
from
me
if
he
came
now
he
would
know
that
he
had
been
found
out
he
would
say
that
i
had
told
you
things
he
would
be
furious
because
you
have
seen
what
there
is
to
see
he
would
know
that
you
could
not
help
but
realise
that
the
money
he
made
me
ask
for
had
not
been
spent
on
the
estate
he
betty
he
would
try
to
force
you
to
go
i
wonder
what
he
would
do
betty
said
again
musingly
she
felt
interested
not
afraid
it
would
be
something
cunning
rosy
protested
it
would
be
something
no
one
could
expect
he
might
be
so
rude
that
you
could
not
remain
in
the
room
with
him
or
he
might
be
quite
polite
and
pretend
he
was
rather
glad
to
see
you
if
he
was
only
frightfully
rude
we
should
be
safer
because
that
would
not
be
an
unexpected
thing
but
if
he
was
polite
it
would
be
because
he
was
arranging
something
hideous
which
you
could
not
defend
yourself
can
you
tell
me
said
betty
quite
slowly
because
as
she
looked
down
at
the
carpet
she
was
thinking
very
hard
the
kind
of
unexpected
thing
he
has
done
to
you
lifting
her
eyes
she
saw
that
a
troubled
flush
was
creeping
over
lady
anstruthers
face
there
have
been
so
many
queer
things
she
faltered
then
betty
knew
there
was
some
special
thing
she
was
afraid
to
talk
about
and
that
if
she
desired
to
obtain
illuminating
information
it
would
be
well
to
go
into
the
matter
try
she
said
to
remember
some
particular
lady
anstruthers
looked
nervous
rosy
in
the
level
voice
there
has
been
a
particular
incident
and
i
would
rather
hear
of
it
from
you
than
from
rosy
lap
held
little
shaking
hands
he
has
held
it
over
me
for
years
she
said
breathlessly
he
said
he
would
write
about
it
to
father
and
mother
he
says
he
could
use
it
against
me
as
evidence
in
in
the
divorce
court
he
says
that
divorce
courts
in
america
are
for
women
but
in
england
they
are
for
men
and
he
could
defend
himself
against
the
incongruity
of
the
picture
of
the
small
faded
creature
arraigned
in
a
divorce
court
on
charges
of
misbehaviour
would
have
made
betty
smile
if
she
had
been
in
smiling
mood
what
did
he
accuse
you
of
that
was
the
the
unexpected
thing
miserably
betty
took
the
unsteady
hands
firmly
in
her
own
do
be
afraid
to
tell
me
she
said
he
knew
you
so
well
that
he
understood
what
would
terrify
you
the
most
i
know
you
so
well
that
i
understand
how
he
does
it
did
he
do
this
unexpected
thing
just
before
you
wrote
to
father
for
the
money
as
she
quite
suddenly
presented
the
question
rosy
exclaimed
aloud
how
did
you
know
she
said
you
you
are
like
a
lawyer
how
could
you
know
how
simple
she
was
how
obviously
an
easy
prey
she
had
been
unconsciously
giving
evidence
with
every
word
i
have
been
thinking
him
over
betty
said
he
interests
me
i
have
begun
to
guess
that
he
always
wants
something
when
he
professes
that
he
has
a
then
with
drooping
head
rosy
told
the
story
yes
it
happened
before
he
made
me
write
to
father
for
so
much
money
the
vicar
was
ill
and
was
obliged
to
go
away
for
six
months
the
clergyman
who
came
to
take
his
place
was
a
young
man
he
was
kind
and
gentle
and
wanted
to
help
people
his
mother
was
with
him
and
she
was
like
him
they
loved
each
other
and
they
were
quite
poor
his
name
was
ffolliott
i
liked
to
hear
him
preach
he
said
things
that
comforted
me
nigel
found
out
that
he
comforted
me
and
when
he
called
here
he
was
more
polite
to
him
than
he
had
ever
been
to
brent
he
seemed
almost
as
if
he
liked
him
he
actually
asked
him
to
dinner
two
or
three
times
after
dinner
he
would
go
out
of
the
room
and
leave
us
together
oh
betty
clinging
to
her
hands
i
was
so
wretched
then
that
sometimes
i
thought
i
was
going
out
of
my
mind
i
think
i
looked
wild
i
used
to
kneel
down
and
try
to
pray
and
i
could
yes
yes
said
betty
i
used
to
feel
that
if
i
could
only
have
one
friend
just
one
i
could
bear
it
better
once
i
said
something
like
that
to
nigel
he
only
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
sneered
when
i
said
it
but
afterwards
i
knew
he
had
remembered
one
evening
when
he
had
asked
ffolliott
to
dinner
he
led
him
to
talk
about
religion
oh
betty
it
made
my
blood
turn
cold
when
he
began
i
knew
he
was
doing
it
for
some
wicked
reason
i
knew
the
look
in
his
eyes
and
the
awful
agreeable
smile
on
his
mouth
when
he
said
at
last
you
could
help
my
poor
wife
to
find
comfort
in
such
things
i
began
to
see
i
could
not
explain
to
anyone
how
he
did
it
but
with
just
a
sentence
dropped
here
and
there
he
seemed
to
tell
the
whole
story
of
a
silly
selfish
american
girl
thwarted
in
her
vulgar
little
ambitions
and
posing
as
a
martyr
because
she
could
not
have
her
own
way
in
everything
he
said
once
quite
casually
afraid
american
women
are
rather
spoiled
and
then
he
said
in
the
same
tolerant
way
poor
man
is
a
disappointment
to
an
american
girl
america
does
not
believe
in
rank
combined
with
lack
of
fortune
i
dared
not
defend
myself
i
am
not
clever
enough
to
think
of
the
right
things
to
say
he
meant
ffolliott
to
understand
that
i
had
married
him
because
i
thought
he
was
grand
and
rich
and
that
i
was
a
disappointed
little
spiteful
shrew
i
tried
to
act
as
if
he
was
not
hurting
me
but
my
hands
trembled
and
a
lump
kept
rising
in
my
throat
when
we
returned
to
the
and
at
last
he
left
us
together
i
was
praying
and
praying
that
i
might
be
able
to
keep
from
breaking
she
stopped
and
swallowed
hard
betty
held
her
hands
firmly
until
she
went
on
for
a
few
minutes
i
sat
still
and
tried
to
think
of
some
new
subject
something
about
the
church
or
the
village
but
i
could
not
begin
to
speak
because
of
the
lump
in
my
throat
and
then
suddenly
but
quietly
ffolliott
got
up
and
though
i
dared
not
lift
my
eyes
i
knew
he
was
standing
before
the
fire
quite
near
me
and
oh
what
do
you
think
he
said
as
low
and
gently
as
if
his
voice
was
a
woman
i
did
not
know
that
people
ever
said
such
things
now
or
even
thought
them
but
never
never
shall
i
forget
that
strange
minute
he
said
just
this
will
help
you
he
will
he
will
as
if
it
was
true
betty
as
if
there
was
a
god
and
he
had
not
forgotten
me
i
did
not
know
what
i
was
doing
but
i
put
out
my
hand
and
caught
at
his
sleeve
and
when
i
looked
up
into
his
face
i
saw
in
his
kind
good
eyes
that
he
knew
that
somehow
god
knows
how
he
understood
and
that
i
need
not
utter
a
word
to
explain
to
him
that
he
had
been
listening
to
did
you
talk
to
him
betty
asked
quietly
he
talked
to
me
we
did
not
even
speak
of
nigel
he
talked
to
me
as
i
had
never
heard
anyone
talk
before
somehow
he
filled
the
room
with
something
real
which
was
hope
and
comfort
and
like
warmth
which
kept
my
soul
from
shivering
the
tears
poured
from
my
eyes
at
first
but
the
lump
in
my
throat
went
away
and
when
nigel
came
back
i
actually
did
not
feel
frightened
though
he
looked
at
me
and
sneered
did
he
say
anything
afterwards
he
laughed
a
little
cold
laugh
and
said
see
you
have
been
seeking
the
consolation
of
religion
neurotic
women
like
confessors
i
do
not
object
to
your
confessing
if
you
confess
your
own
backslidings
and
not
mine
that
was
the
beginning
said
betty
speculatively
the
unexpected
thing
was
the
end
tell
me
the
rest
no
one
could
have
dreamed
of
it
rosy
broke
forth
for
weeks
he
was
almost
like
other
people
he
stayed
at
stornham
and
spent
his
days
in
shooting
he
professed
that
he
was
rather
enjoying
himself
in
a
dull
way
he
encouraged
me
to
go
to
the
vicarage
he
invited
the
ffolliotts
here
he
said
ffolliott
was
a
gentlewoman
and
good
for
me
he
said
it
was
proper
that
i
should
interest
myself
in
parish
work
once
or
twice
he
even
brought
some
little
message
to
me
from
it
was
a
pitiably
simple
story
betty
saw
through
its
relation
the
unconsciousness
of
the
easily
allured
victim
the
adroit
leading
on
from
step
to
step
the
ordinary
natural
seeming
method
which
arranged
opportunities
the
two
had
been
thrown
together
at
the
court
at
the
vicarage
the
church
and
in
the
village
and
the
hawk
had
looked
on
and
bided
his
time
for
the
first
time
in
her
years
of
exile
rosy
had
begun
to
feel
that
she
might
be
allowed
a
friend
though
she
lived
in
secret
tremor
lest
the
normal
liberty
permitted
her
should
suddenly
be
snatched
away
we
never
talked
of
nigel
she
said
twisting
her
hands
but
he
made
me
begin
to
live
again
he
talked
to
me
of
something
that
watched
and
would
not
leave
me
would
never
leave
me
i
was
learning
to
believe
it
sometimes
when
i
walked
through
the
wood
to
the
village
i
used
to
stop
among
the
trees
and
look
up
at
the
bits
of
sky
between
the
branches
and
listen
to
the
sound
in
the
leaves
the
sound
that
never
stops
and
it
seemed
as
if
it
was
saying
something
to
me
and
i
would
clasp
my
hands
and
whisper
yes
will
will
i
used
to
see
nigel
looking
at
me
at
table
with
a
queer
smile
in
his
eyes
and
once
he
said
to
me
are
growing
young
and
lovely
my
dear
your
colour
is
improving
the
counsels
of
our
friend
are
of
a
salutary
nature
it
would
have
made
me
nervous
but
he
said
it
almost
and
i
was
silly
enough
even
to
wonder
if
it
could
be
possible
that
he
was
pleased
to
see
me
looking
less
ill
it
was
true
betty
that
i
was
growing
stronger
but
it
did
not
last
i
was
afraid
not
said
betty
an
old
woman
in
the
lane
near
bartyon
wood
was
ffolliott
had
asked
me
to
go
to
see
her
and
i
used
to
go
she
suffered
a
great
deal
and
clung
to
us
both
he
comforted
her
as
he
comforted
me
sometimes
when
he
was
called
away
he
would
send
a
note
to
me
asking
me
to
go
to
her
one
day
he
wrote
hastily
saying
that
she
was
dying
and
asked
if
i
would
go
with
him
to
her
cottage
at
once
i
knew
it
would
save
time
if
i
met
him
in
the
path
which
was
a
short
cut
so
i
wrote
a
few
words
and
gave
them
to
the
messenger
i
said
not
come
to
the
house
i
will
meet
you
in
bartyon
wood
betty
made
a
slight
movement
and
in
her
face
there
was
a
dawning
of
mingled
amazement
and
incredulity
the
thought
which
had
come
to
her
seemed
as
ughtred
locking
of
the
door
had
seemed
too
wild
for
modern
days
lady
anstruthers
saw
her
expression
and
understood
it
she
made
a
hopeless
gesture
with
her
small
bony
hand
yes
she
said
it
is
just
like
that
no
one
would
believe
it
the
worst
cleverness
of
the
things
he
does
is
that
when
one
tells
of
them
they
sound
like
lies
i
have
a
bewildered
feeling
that
i
should
not
believe
them
myself
if
i
had
not
seen
them
he
met
the
boy
in
the
park
and
took
the
note
from
him
he
came
back
to
the
house
and
up
to
my
room
where
i
was
dressing
quickly
to
go
to
she
stopped
for
quite
a
minute
rather
as
if
to
recover
breath
he
closed
the
door
behind
him
and
came
towards
me
with
the
note
in
his
hand
and
i
saw
in
a
second
the
look
that
always
terrifies
me
in
his
face
he
had
opened
the
note
and
he
smoothed
out
the
paper
quietly
and
said
is
this
i
could
not
help
it
i
turned
cold
and
began
to
shiver
i
could
not
imagine
what
was
it
my
note
to
mr
ffolliott
i
asked
it
is
your
note
to
ffolliott
and
he
read
it
aloud
do
not
come
to
the
house
i
will
meet
you
in
bartyon
that
is
a
nice
note
for
a
man
wife
to
have
written
to
be
picked
up
and
read
by
a
stranger
if
your
confessor
is
not
cautious
in
the
matter
of
letters
from
women
when
he
begins
a
thing
in
that
way
you
may
always
know
that
he
has
planned
everything
that
you
can
do
nothing
i
always
know
i
knew
then
and
i
knew
i
was
quite
white
when
i
answered
him
wrote
it
in
a
great
hurry
farne
is
worse
we
are
going
together
to
her
i
said
i
would
meet
him
to
save
time
he
laughed
his
awful
little
laugh
and
touched
the
paper
have
no
doubt
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
if
other
persons
saw
this
they
would
believe
it
it
is
very
likely
you
believe
it
i
said
know
it
is
true
no
one
would
be
so
silly
so
silly
and
wicked
as
to
then
i
broke
down
and
cried
out
do
you
mean
what
could
anyone
think
it
meant
i
was
so
wild
that
i
felt
as
if
i
was
going
crazy
he
clenched
my
wrist
and
shook
me
think
you
can
play
the
fool
with
me
he
said
have
been
watching
this
thing
from
the
first
the
first
time
i
leave
you
alone
with
the
fellow
i
come
back
to
find
you
have
been
giving
him
an
emotional
scene
do
you
suppose
your
simpering
good
spirits
and
your
imbecile
pink
cheeks
told
me
nothing
they
told
me
exactly
this
i
have
waited
to
come
upon
it
and
here
it
is
do
not
come
to
the
house
i
will
meet
you
in
the
that
was
the
unexpected
thing
it
was
no
use
to
argue
and
try
to
explain
i
knew
he
did
not
believe
what
he
was
saying
but
he
worked
himself
into
a
rage
he
accused
me
of
awful
things
and
called
me
awful
names
in
a
loud
voice
so
that
he
could
be
heard
until
i
was
dumb
and
staggering
all
the
time
i
knew
there
was
a
reason
but
i
could
not
tell
then
what
it
was
he
said
at
last
that
he
was
going
to
ffolliott
he
said
will
meet
him
in
the
wood
and
i
will
take
your
note
with
me
betty
it
was
so
shameful
that
i
fell
down
on
my
knees
do
do
do
that
i
said
beg
of
you
nigel
he
is
a
gentleman
and
a
clergyman
i
beg
and
beg
of
you
if
you
will
not
i
will
do
anything
anything
and
at
that
minute
i
remembered
how
he
had
tried
to
make
me
write
to
father
for
money
and
i
cried
out
catching
at
his
coat
and
holding
him
back
will
write
to
father
as
you
asked
me
i
will
do
anything
i
ca
bear
it
that
was
the
whole
meaning
of
the
whole
thing
said
betty
with
eyes
ablaze
that
was
the
beginning
the
middle
and
the
end
what
did
he
say
he
pretended
to
be
made
more
angry
he
said
insult
me
by
trying
to
bribe
me
with
your
vulgar
money
do
insult
me
but
he
gradually
grew
sulky
instead
of
raging
and
though
he
put
the
note
in
his
pocket
he
did
not
go
to
ffolliott
and
i
wrote
to
i
remember
that
betty
answered
did
you
ever
speak
to
ffolliott
again
he
guessed
he
knew
i
saw
it
in
his
kind
brown
eyes
when
he
passed
me
without
speaking
in
the
village
i
daresay
the
villagers
were
told
about
the
awful
thing
by
some
servant
who
heard
nigel
voice
villagers
always
know
what
is
happening
he
went
away
a
few
weeks
later
the
day
before
he
went
i
had
walked
through
the
wood
and
just
outside
it
i
met
him
he
stopped
for
one
minute
just
one
he
lifted
his
hat
and
said
just
as
he
had
spoken
them
that
first
night
just
the
same
words
will
help
you
he
will
he
will
a
strange
almost
unearthly
joy
suddenly
flashed
across
her
face
it
must
be
true
she
said
it
must
be
true
he
has
sent
you
betty
it
has
been
a
long
time
it
has
been
so
long
that
sometimes
i
have
forgotten
his
words
but
you
have
come
yes
i
have
come
betty
answered
and
she
bent
forward
and
kissed
her
gently
as
if
she
had
been
soothing
a
child
there
were
other
questions
to
ask
she
was
obliged
to
ask
them
the
unexpected
thing
had
been
used
as
an
instrument
for
years
it
was
always
efficacious
over
the
yearningly
homesick
creature
had
hung
the
threat
that
her
father
and
mother
those
she
ached
and
longed
for
could
be
told
the
story
in
such
a
manner
as
would
brand
her
as
a
woman
with
a
shameful
secret
how
could
she
explain
herself
there
were
the
awful
written
words
he
was
her
husband
he
was
remorseless
plausible
she
dared
not
write
freely
she
had
no
witnesses
to
call
upon
she
had
discovered
that
he
had
planned
with
composed
steadiness
that
misleading
impressions
should
be
given
to
servants
and
village
people
when
the
brents
returned
to
the
vicarage
she
had
observed
with
terror
that
for
some
reason
they
stiffened
and
looked
askance
when
the
ffolliotts
were
mentioned
i
am
afraid
lady
anstruthers
that
ffolliott
was
a
great
mistake
brent
said
once
lady
anstruthers
had
not
dared
to
ask
any
questions
she
had
felt
the
awkward
colour
rising
in
her
face
and
had
known
that
she
looked
guilty
but
if
she
had
protested
against
the
injustice
of
the
remark
sir
nigel
would
have
heard
of
her
words
before
the
day
had
passed
and
she
shuddered
to
think
of
the
result
he
had
by
that
time
reached
the
point
of
referring
to
ffolliott
with
sneering
lightness
as
your
do
you
defend
your
lover
to
me
he
had
said
on
one
occasion
when
she
had
entered
a
timid
protest
and
her
white
face
and
wild
helpless
eyes
had
been
such
evidence
as
to
the
effect
the
word
had
produced
that
he
had
seen
the
expediency
of
making
a
point
of
using
it
the
blood
beat
in
betty
vanderpoel
veins
rosy
she
said
looking
steadily
in
the
faded
face
tell
me
this
did
you
never
think
of
getting
away
from
him
of
going
somewhere
and
trying
to
reach
father
by
cable
or
letter
by
some
means
lady
anstruthers
weary
and
wrinkled
little
smile
was
a
pitiably
illuminating
thing
my
dear
she
said
if
you
are
strong
and
beautiful
and
rich
and
well
dressed
so
that
people
care
to
look
at
you
and
listen
to
what
you
say
you
can
do
things
but
who
in
england
will
listen
to
a
shabby
dowdy
frightened
woman
when
she
runs
away
from
her
husband
if
he
follows
her
and
tells
people
she
is
hysterical
or
mad
or
bad
it
is
the
shabby
dowdy
woman
who
is
in
the
wrong
at
first
i
thought
of
nothing
else
but
trying
to
get
away
and
once
i
went
to
stornham
station
i
walked
all
the
way
on
a
hot
day
and
just
as
i
was
getting
into
a
carriage
nigel
marched
in
and
caught
my
arm
and
held
me
back
i
fainted
and
when
i
came
to
myself
i
was
in
the
carriage
being
driven
back
to
the
court
and
he
was
sitting
opposite
to
me
he
said
fool
it
would
take
a
cleverer
woman
than
you
to
carry
that
out
and
i
knew
it
was
the
awful
it
is
not
the
awful
truth
now
said
betty
and
she
rose
to
her
feet
and
stood
looking
before
her
but
with
a
look
which
did
not
rest
on
chairs
and
tables
she
remained
so
standing
for
a
few
moments
of
dead
silence
what
a
fool
he
was
she
said
at
last
and
what

she
bent
and
taking
rosy
face
between
her
hands
kissed
it
with
a
kiss
which
seemed
like
a
seal
that
will
do
she
said
now
i
know
one
must
know
what
is
in
one
hands
and
what
is
not
then
one
need
not
waste
time
in
talking
of
miserable
things
one
can
save
one
strength
for
doing
what
can
be
i
believe
you
would
always
think
about
doing
things
said
lady
anstruthers
that
is
american
it
is
a
quality
americans
inherited
from
england
lightly
one
of
the
results
of
it
is
that
england
covers
a
rather
large
share
of
the
map
of
the
world
it
is
a
practical
quality
you
and
i
might
spend
hours
in
talking
to
each
other
of
what
nigel
has
done
and
what
you
have
done
of
what
he
has
said
and
of
what
you
have
said
we
might
give
some
hours
i
daresay
to
what
the
dowager
did
and
said
but
wiser
people
than
we
are
have
found
out
that
thinking
of
black
things
past
is
living
them
again
and
it
is
like
poisoning
one
blood
it
is
deterioration
of
she
said
the
last
words
as
if
she
had
ended
with
a
jest
but
she
knew
what
she
was
doing
you
were
tricked
into
giving
up
what
was
yours
to
a
person
who
could
not
be
trusted
what
has
been
done
with
it
scarcely
matters
it
is
not
yours
but
sir
nigel
but
we
are
not
helpless
because
we
have
in
our
hands
the
most
powerful
material
agent
in
the
world
come
rosy
and
let
us
walk
over
the
house
we
will
begin
with
chapter
xvii
townlinson
sheppard
during
the
whole
course
of
her
interesting
life
and
she
had
always
found
life
interesting
betty
vanderpoel
decided
that
she
had
known
no
experience
more
absorbing
than
this
morning
spent
in
going
over
the
and
deserted
portions
of
the
neglected
house
she
had
never
seen
anything
like
the
place
or
as
full
of
suggestion
the
greater
part
of
it
had
simply
been
shut
up
and
left
to
time
and
weather
both
of
which
had
had
their
effects
the
fine
old
red
roof
having
lost
tiles
had
fallen
into
leaks
that
let
in
rain
which
had
stained
and
rotted
walls
plaster
and
woodwork
wind
and
storm
had
beaten
through
broken
window
panes
and
done
their
worst
with
such
furniture
and
hangings
as
they
found
to
whip
and
toss
and
leave
damp
and
spotted
with
mould
they
passed
through
corridors
and
up
and
down
short
or
long
stairways
with
stained
or
faded
walls
and
sometimes
with
cracked
or
fallen
plastering
and
wainscotting
here
and
there
the
oak
flooring
itself
was
uncertain
the
rooms
whether
large
or
small
all
presented
a
like
aspect
of
potential
beauty
and
comfort
utterly
uncared
for
and
forlorn
there
were
many
rooms
but
none
more
than
scantily
furnished
and
a
number
of
them
were
stripped
bare
betty
found
herself
wondering
how
long
a
time
it
had
taken
the
belongings
of
the
big
place
to
dwindle
and
melt
away
into
such
bareness
there
was
a
time
i
suppose
when
it
was
all
furnished
she
said
all
these
rooms
were
shut
up
when
i
came
here
rosy
answered
i
suppose
things
worth
selling
have
been
sold
when
pieces
of
furniture
were
broken
in
one
part
of
the
house
they
were
replaced
by
things
brought
from
another
no
one
cared
nigel
hates
it
all
he
calls
it
a
rathole
he
detests
the
country
everywhere
but
particularly
this
part
of
it
after
the
first
year
i
had
learned
better
than
to
speak
to
him
of
spending
money
on
a
good
deal
of
money
should
be
spent
on
repairs
reflected
betty
looking
about
her
she
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
a
room
whose
walls
were
hung
with
the
remains
of
what
had
been
chintz
covered
with
a
pattern
of
loose
clusters
of
moss
rosebuds
the
dampness
had
rotted
it
until
in
some
places
it
had
fallen
away
in
strips
from
its
fastenings
a
quaint
embroidered
couch
stood
in
one
corner
and
as
betty
looked
at
it
a
mouse
crept
from
under
the
tattered
valance
stared
at
her
in
alarm
and
suddenly
darted
back
again
in
terror
of
intrusion
so
unusual
a
casement
window
swung
open
on
a
broken
hinge
and
a
strong
branch
of
ivy
having
forced
its
way
inside
had
thrown
a
covering
of
leaves
over
the
deep
ledge
and
was
beginning
to
climb
the
inner
woodwork
through
the
casement
was
to
be
seen
a
heavenly
spread
of
country
whose
rolling
lands
were
clad
softly
in
green
pastures
and
trees
this
is
the
rosebud
boudoir
said
lady
anstruthers
smiling
faintly
all
the
rooms
have
names
i
thought
them
so
delightful
when
i
first
heard
them
the
damask
room
the
tapestry
room
the
white
wainscot
room
my
lady
chamber
it
almost
broke
my
heart
when
i
saw
what
they
looked
it
would
be
very
interesting
betty
commented
slowly
to
make
them
look
as
they
ought
to
a
remote
fear
rose
to
the
surface
of
the
expression
in
lady
eyes
she
could
not
detach
herself
from
certain
recollections
of
nigel
of
his
opinions
of
her
family
of
his
determination
not
to
allow
it
to
enter
as
a
factor
in
either
his
life
or
hers
and
betty
had
come
to
stornham
betty
whom
he
had
detested
as
a
child
and
in
the
course
of
two
days
she
had
seemed
to
become
a
new
part
of
the
atmosphere
and
to
make
the
dead
despair
of
the
place
begin
to
stir
with
life
what
other
thing
than
this
was
happening
as
she
spoke
of
making
such
rooms
as
the
rosebud
boudoir
look
as
they
ought
to
look
and
said
the
words
not
as
if
they
were
part
of
a
fantastic
vision
but
as
if
they
expressed
a
perfectly
possible
thing
betty
saw
the
doubt
in
her
eyes
and
in
a
measure
guessed
at
its
meaning
the
time
to
pause
for
argument
had
however
not
arrived
there
was
too
much
to
be
investigated
too
much
to
be
seen
she
swept
her
on
her
way
they
wandered
on
through
some
forty
rooms
more
or
less
they
opened
doors
and
closed
them
they
unbarred
shutters
and
let
the
sun
stream
in
on
dust
and
dampness
and
cobwebs
the
comprehension
of
the
situation
which
betty
gained
was
as
valuable
as
it
was
enlightening
the
descent
into
the
lower
part
of
the
house
was
a
new
experience
betty
had
not
before
seen
huge
flagged
kitchens
vaulted
servants
halls
stone
passages
butteries
and
dairies
the
substantial
masonry
of
the
walls
and
arched
ceilings
the
stone
stairway
and
the
seemingly
endless
offices
were
interestingly
remote
in
idea
from
such
domestic
modernities
as
chance
views
of
american
household
workings
had
provided
her
in
the
huge
kitchen
itself
an
elderly
woman
rolling
pastry
paused
to
curtsy
to
them
with
stolid
curiosity
in
her
face
in
her
character
as
cook
noakes
had
sent
up
uninviting
meals
to
lady
anstruthers
for
several
years
but
she
had
not
seen
her
ladyship
below
stairs
before
and
this
was
the
unexpected
arrival
the
young
lady
there
had
been
talk
of
from
the
moment
of
her
appearance
noakes
admitted
with
the
grudgingness
of
a
person
of
uncheerful
temperament
that
looks
like
that
always
would
make
talk
a
certain
degree
of
vague
mental
illumination
led
her
to
agree
with
robert
the
footman
that
the
stranger
effectiveness
was
perhaps
also
not
altogether
a
matter
of
good
looks
and
certainly
it
was
not
an
affair
of
clothes
her
brightish
blue
dress
of
rough
cloth
was
nothing
particular
notwithstanding
the
fit
of
it
there
was
something
else
about
she
looked
round
the
place
not
with
the
casual
indifference
of
a
fine
young
lady
carelessly
curious
to
see
what
she
had
not
seen
before
but
with
an
alert
questioning
interest
what
a
big
place
she
said
to
her
ladyship
what
substantial
walls
what
huge
joints
must
have
been
roasted
before
such
a
she
drew
near
to
the
enormous
antiquated
cooking
place
people
were
not
very
practical
when
this
was
built
she
said
it
looks
as
if
it
must
waste
a
great
deal
of
coal
is
it
she
looked
at
noakes
do
you
like
it
there
was
a
practical
directness
in
the
question
for
which
noakes
was
not
prepared
until
this
moment
it
had
apparently
mattered
little
whether
she
liked
things
or
not
the
condition
of
her
implements
of
trade
was
one
of
her
grievances
the
ancient
fireplace
and
ovens
the
bitterest
it
out
of
order
miss
she
answered
and
they
do
use
like
this
in
these
i
thought
not
said
miss
vanderpoel
she
made
other
inquiries
as
direct
and
significant
of
the
observing
eye
and
her
passage
through
the
lower
part
of
the
establishment
left
noakes
and
her
companions
in
a
strange
but
not
unpleasurable
state
of
ferment
think
of
a
young
lady
that
never
had
nothing
to
do
with
kitchens
going
straight
to
that
shameful
old
fireplace
and
seeing
what
it
meant
to
the
woman
that
got
to
use
it
you
like
it
she
says
if
been
a
cook
herself
she
could
have
put
it
straighter
she
got
she
been
using
them
all
over
the
place
said
robert
her
and
her
ladyship
been
into
rooms
that
not
been
opened
for
more
shame
to
them
that
should
have
opened
remarked
noakes
her
ladyship
a
poor
listless
thing
but
her
spirit
was
broken
long
ago
this
one
will
mend
it
for
her
perhaps
said
the
man
servant
i
wonder
what
going
to
well
she
got
a
look
with
her
the
new
one
as
if
where
she
was
things
would
be
likely
to
happen
you
look
out
the
place
wo
seem
so
dead
and
alive
if
we
got
something
to
think
of
and
who
are
the
solicitors
sir
nigel
employs
betty
had
asked
her
sister
when
their
pilgrimage
through
the
house
had
been
completed
townlinson
sheppard
a
firm
which
for
several
generations
had
transacted
the
legal
business
of
much
more
important
estates
than
stornham
held
its
affairs
in
hand
lady
anstruthers
knew
nothing
of
them
but
that
they
evidently
did
not
approve
of
the
conduct
of
their
client
nigel
was
frequently
angry
when
he
spoke
of
them
it
could
be
gathered
that
they
had
refused
to
allow
him
to
do
things
he
wished
to
do
sell
things
or
borrow
money
on
them
i
think
we
must
go
to
london
and
see
them
betty
suggested
rosy
was
agitated
why
should
one
see
them
what
was
there
to
be
spoken
of
their
going
betty
explained
would
be
a
sort
of
visit
of
ceremony
in
a
measure
a
precaution
since
sir
nigel
was
apparently
not
to
be
reached
having
given
no
clue
as
to
where
he
intended
to
go
it
might
be
discreet
to
consult
townlinson
sheppard
with
regard
to
the
things
it
might
be
well
to
do
the
repairs
it
appeared
necessary
to
make
at
once
if
townlinson
sheppard
approved
of
the
doing
of
such
work
sir
nigel
could
not
resent
their
action
and
say
that
in
his
absence
liberties
had
been
taken
such
a
course
seemed
businesslike
and
dignified
it
was
what
betty
felt
that
her
father
would
do
nothing
could
be
complained
of
which
was
done
with
the
knowledge
and
under
the
sanction
of
the
family
solicitors
then
there
are
other
things
we
must
do
we
must
go
to
shops
and
theatres
it
will
be
good
for
you
to
go
to
shops
and
theatres
i
have
nothing
but
rags
to
wear
answered
lady
anstruthers
reddening
then
before
we
go
we
will
have
things
sent
down
people
can
be
sent
from
the
shops
to
arrange
what
we
the
magic
of
the
name
standing
for
great
wealth
could
it
was
true
bring
to
them
not
only
the
contents
of
shops
but
the
people
who
showed
them
and
were
ready
to
carry
out
any
orders
the
name
of
vanderpoel
already
stood
in
london
for
inexhaustible
resource
yes
it
was
simple
enough
to
send
for
politely
subservient
saleswomen
to
bring
what
one
wanted
the
being
reminded
in
matters
of
the
still
real
existence
of
the
power
of
this
magic
was
the
first
step
in
the
rebuilding
of
lady
anstruthers
to
realise
that
the
wonderful
and
yet
simple
necromancy
was
gradually
encircling
her
again
had
its
parallel
in
the
taking
of
a
tonic
whose
effect
was
cumulative
she
herself
did
not
realise
the
working
of
it
but
betty
regarded
it
with
interest
she
saw
it
was
good
for
her
merely
to
look
on
at
the
unpacking
of
the
new
york
boxes
which
the
maid
sent
for
from
london
brought
down
with
her
as
the
woman
removed
from
tray
after
tray
the
layers
of
garments
lady
anstruthers
sat
and
watched
her
with
normal
simply
feminine
interest
growing
in
her
eyes
the
things
were
made
with
the
absence
of
any
limit
in
expenditure
the
freedom
with
delicate
stuffs
and
priceless
laces
which
belonged
only
to
her
faint
memories
of
a
lost
past
nothing
had
limited
the
time
spent
in
the
embroidering
of
this
apparently
simple
linen
frock
and
coat
nothing
had
restrained
the
hand
holding
the
scissors
which
had
cut
into
the
lace
which
adorned
in
appliques
and
filmy
frills
this
exquisitely
charming
ball
dress
it
is
looking
back
so
far
she
said
waving
her
hand
towards
them
with
an
odd
gesture
to
think
that
it
was
once
all
like
like
she
got
up
and
went
to
the
things
turning
them
over
and
touching
them
with
a
softness
almost
expressing
a
caress
the
names
of
the
makers
stamped
on
bands
and
collars
the
names
of
the
streets
in
which
their
shops
stood
moved
her
she
heard
again
the
once
familiar
rattle
of
wheels
and
the
rush
and
roar
of
new
york
traffic
betty
carried
on
the
whole
matter
with
lightness
she
talked
easily
and
casually
giving
local
colour
to
what
she
said
she
described
the
abnormally
rapid
growth
of
the
places
her
sister
had
known
in
her
teens
the
new
buildings
new
theatres
new
shops
new
people
the
later
mode
of
living
much
of
it
learned
from
england
through
the
unceasing
weaving
of
the
shuttle
changing
changing
changing
that
is
what
it
is
always
doing
america
we
have
not
reached
repose
yet
one
wonders
how
long
it
will
be
before
we
shall
now
we
are
always
hurrying
breathlessly
after
the
next
thing
the
new
one
which
we
always
think
will
be
the
better
one
other
countries
built
themselves
slowly
in
the
days
of
their
building
the
pace
of
life
was
a
march
when
america
was
born
the
march
had
already
begun
to
hasten
and
as
a
nation
we
began
in
our
first
hour
at
the
quickening
speed
now
the
pace
is
a
race
new
york
is
a
kaleidoscope
i
myself
can
remember
it
a
wholly
different
thing
one
passes
down
a
street
one
day
and
the
next
there
is
a
great
gap
where
some
building
is
being
torn
down
a
few
days
later
a
tall
structure
of
some
sort
is
touching
the
sky
it
is
wonderful
but
it
does
not
tend
to
calm
the
mind
that
is
why
we
cross
the
atlantic
so
much
the
sober
blood
our
forbears
brought
from
older
countries
goes
in
search
of
rest
mixed
with
other
things
i
feel
in
my
own
being
a
resentment
against
newness
and
disorder
and
an
insistence
on
the
atmosphere
of
but
for
years
lady
anstruthers
had
been
living
in
the
atmosphere
of
things
and
felt
no
insistence
upon
it
she
yearned
to
hear
of
the
great
changing
western
world
of
the
great
changing
city
betty
must
tell
her
what
the
changes
were
what
were
the
differences
in
the
streets
where
had
the
new
buildings
been
placed
how
had
fifth
avenue
and
madison
avenue
and
broadway
altered
were
not
gramercy
park
and
madison
square
still
green
with
grass
and
trees
was
it
all
different
would
she
not
know
the
old
places
herself
though
it
seemed
a
lifetime
since
she
had
seen
them
the
years
which
had
passed
were
really
not
so
many
it
was
good
for
her
to
talk
and
be
talked
to
in
this
manner
betty
saw
still
handling
her
subject
lightly
she
presented
picture
after
picture
some
of
them
were
of
the
wonderful
feverish
city
itself
the
place
quite
passionately
loved
by
some
as
passionately
disliked
by
others
she
herself
had
fallen
into
the
habit
as
she
left
childhood
behind
her
of
looking
at
it
with
interested
wonder
at
its
riot
of
life
and
power
of
huge
schemes
and
almost
superhuman
labours
of
fortunes
so
colossal
that
they
seemed
monstrosities
in
their
relation
to
the
world
people
who
in
rosalie
girlhood
had
lived
in
big
ugly
brownstone
fronts
had
built
for
themselves
or
for
their
children
houses
such
as
in
other
countries
would
have
belonged
to
nobles
and
princes
spending
fortunes
upon
their
building
filling
them
with
treasures
brought
from
foreign
lands
from
palaces
from
art
galleries
from
collectors
sometimes
strange
people
built
such
houses
and
lived
strange
lavish
ostentatious
lives
in
them
forming
an
overstrained
abnormal
world
of
their
own
the
passing
of
even
ten
years
in
new
york
counted
itself
almost
as
a
generation
the
fashions
customs
belongings
of
twenty
years
ago
wore
an
air
of
almost
picturesque
antiquity
it
does
not
take
long
to
make
an
new
yorker
she
said
each
day
brings
so
many
new
there
were
indeed
many
new
ones
lady
anstruthers
found
people
who
had
been
poor
had
become
hugely
rich
a
few
who
had
been
rich
had
become
poor
possessions
which
had
been
large
had
swelled
to
unnatural
proportions
out
of
the
west
had
risen
fortunes
more
monstrous
than
all
others
as
she
told
one
story
after
another
bettina
realised
as
she
had
done
often
before
that
it
was
impossible
to
enter
into
description
of
the
life
and
movements
of
the
place
without
its
curiously
involving
some
connection
with
the
huge
wealth
of
it
with
its
influence
its
rise
its
swelling
or
waning
somehow
one
can
not
free
one
self
from
it
this
is
the
age
of
wealth
and
invention
but
of
wealth
before
all
else
sometimes
one
is
tired
tired
of
you
would
not
be
tired
of
it
if
well
if
you
were
i
said
lady
anstruthers
rather
pathetically
perhaps
not
betty
answered
perhaps
she
herself
had
seen
people
who
were
not
tired
of
it
in
the
sense
in
which
she
was
the
men
and
women
with
worn
or
intently
anxious
faces
hastening
with
the
crowds
upon
the
pavements
all
hastening
somewhere
in
chase
of
that
small
portion
of
the
wealth
which
they
earned
by
their
labour
as
their
daily
share
the
same
men
and
women
surging
towards
elevated
railroad
stations
to
seize
on
places
in
the
trains
or
standing
in
groups
waiting
for
the
approach
of
an
already
overfull
street
car
in
which
they
must
be
packed
together
and
swing
to
the
hanging
straps
to
keep
upon
their
feet
their
way
of
being
weary
of
it
would
be
different
from
hers
they
would
be
weary
only
of
hearing
of
the
mountains
of
it
which
rolled
themselves
up
as
it
seemed
in
obedience
to
some
irresistible
occult
force
on
the
day
after
stornham
village
had
learned
that
her
ladyship
and
miss
vanderpoel
had
actually
gone
to
london
the
dignified
firm
of
townlinson
sheppard
received
a
visit
which
created
some
slight
sensation
in
their
establishment
though
it
had
not
been
entirely
unexpected
it
had
indeed
been
heralded
by
a
note
from
miss
vanderpoel
herself
who
had
asked
that
the
appointment
be
made
men
of
townlinson
sheppard
indubitable
rank
in
their
profession
could
not
fail
to
know
the
significance
of
the
vanderpoel
name
they
knew
and
understood
its
weight
perfectly
well
when
their
client
had
married
one
of
reuben
vanderpoel
daughters
they
had
felt
that
extraordinary
good
fortune
had
befallen
him
and
his
estate
their
private
opinion
had
been
that
vanderpoel
knowledge
of
his
must
have
been
limited
or
that
he
had
curiously
lax
american
views
of
paternal
duty
the
firm
was
highly
reputable
long
established
strictly
conservative
and
somewhat
insular
in
its
point
of
view
it
did
not
understand
or
seek
to
understand
america
it
had
excellent
reasons
for
thoroughly
understanding
sir
nigel
anstruthers
its
opinions
of
him
it
reserved
to
itself
if
townlinson
sheppard
had
been
asked
to
give
a
daughter
into
their
client
keeping
they
would
have
flatly
refused
to
accept
the
honour
proposed
townlinson
had
indeed
at
the
time
of
the
marriage
admitted
in
strict
confidence
to
his
partner
that
for
his
part
he
would
have
somewhat
preferred
to
follow
a
daughter
of
his
own
to
her
tomb
after
the
marriage
the
firm
had
found
the
situation
confusing
and
there
had
been
trouble
with
sir
nigel
who
had
plainly
been
disappointed
at
first
it
had
appeared
that
the
american
magnate
had
shown
astuteness
in
refraining
from
leaving
his
a
free
hand
lady
anstruthers
fortune
was
her
own
and
not
her
husband
townlinson
paying
a
visit
to
stornham
and
finding
the
bride
a
gentle
girl
whose
most
marked
expression
was
one
of
growing
timorousness
had
returned
with
a
grave
face
he
foresaw
the
result
if
her
family
did
not
stand
by
her
with
firmness
which
he
also
foresaw
her
husband
would
prevent
if
possible
it
became
apparent
that
the
family
did
not
stand
by
her
or
were
cleverly
kept
at
a
distance
there
was
a
long
illness
which
seemed
to
end
in
the
seclusion
from
the
world
brought
about
by
broken
health
then
it
was
certain
that
what
townlinson
had
foreseen
had
occurred
the
inexperienced
girl
had
been
bullied
into
submission
sir
nigel
had
gained
the
free
hand
whatever
the
means
he
had
chosen
to
employ
most
improper
most
improper
the
whole
affair
he
had
a
great
deal
of
money
but
none
of
it
was
used
for
the
benefit
of
the
estate
his
deformed
boy
estate
advice
dignified
remonstrance
resulted
only
in
most
disagreeable
scenes
townlinson
sheppard
could
not
exceed
certain
limits
the
manner
in
which
the
money
was
spent
was
discreditable
there
were
avenues
a
respectable
firm
knew
only
by
rumour
there
were
insane
gambling
speculations
which
could
only
end
in
disaster
there
were
things
one
could
not
decently
concern
one
self
with
lady
anstruthers
family
had
doubtless
become
indignant
and
disgusted
and
had
dropped
the
whole
affair
sad
for
the
poor
woman
but
not
unnatural
and
now
appears
a
miss
vanderpoel
who
wishes
to
appoint
an
interview
with
townlinson
sheppard
what
does
she
wish
to
say
the
family
is
apparently
taking
the
matter
up
is
this
lady
an
elder
or
a
younger
sister
of
lady
anstruthers
is
she
an
older
woman
of
that
strong
and
rather
trying
american
type
one
hears
of
or
is
she
younger
than
her
ladyship
a
pretty
indignant
totally
unpractical
girl
outraged
by
the
state
of
affairs
she
has
discovered
foolishly
coming
to
demand
of
townlinson
sheppard
an
explanation
of
things
they
are
not
responsible
for
will
she
perhaps
lose
her
temper
and
accuse
and
reproach
or
even
most
unpleasant
to
contemplate
shed
hysterical
tears
it
fell
to
townlinson
to
receive
her
in
the
absence
of
sheppard
who
had
been
called
to
northamptonshire
to
attend
to
great
affairs
he
was
a
stout
grave
man
with
a
heavy
face
and
when
bettina
entered
his
room
his
courteous
reception
of
her
reserved
his
view
of
the
situation
entirely
she
was
not
of
the
mature
and
rather
alarming
american
type
he
had
imagined
possible
he
felt
some
relief
in
marking
at
once
she
was
also
not
the
pretty
fashionable
young
lady
who
might
have
come
to
scold
him
and
ask
silly
irrational
questions
his
ordinarily
rather
unillumined
countenance
changed
somewhat
in
expression
when
she
sat
down
and
began
to
speak
townlinson
was
impressed
by
the
fact
that
it
was
at
once
unmistakably
evident
that
whatsoever
her
reason
for
coming
she
had
not
presented
herself
to
ask
irrelevant
or
unreasonable
questions
lady
anstruthers
she
explained
without
superfluous
phrase
had
no
definite
knowledge
of
her
whereabouts
and
it
had
seemed
possible
that
townlinson
sheppard
might
have
received
some
information
more
recent
that
her
own
the
impersonal
framing
of
this
inquiry
struck
townlinson
as
being
in
remarkably
good
taste
since
it
conveyed
no
condemnation
of
sir
nigel
and
no
desire
to
involve
townlinson
in
expressing
any
it
refrained
even
from
implying
that
the
situation
was
an
unusual
one
which
might
be
open
to
criticism
excellent
reserve
and
great
cleverness
townlinson
commented
inwardly
there
were
certainly
few
young
ladies
who
would
have
clearly
realised
that
a
solicitor
can
not
be
called
upon
to
commit
himself
until
he
has
had
time
to
weigh
matters
and
decide
upon
them
his
long
and
varied
experience
had
included
interviews
in
which
charming
emotional
women
had
expected
him
at
once
to
take
miss
vanderpoel
exhibited
no
signs
of
expecting
anything
of
this
kind
even
when
she
went
on
with
what
she
had
come
to
say
stornham
court
and
its
surroundings
were
depreciating
seriously
in
value
through
need
of
radical
repairs
etc
her
sister
comfort
was
naturally
involved
and
as
townlinson
would
fully
understand
her
nephew
future
the
sooner
the
process
of
dilapidation
was
arrested
the
better
and
with
the
less
difficulty
the
present
time
was
without
doubt
better
than
an
indefinite
future
miss
vanderpoel
having
fortunately
been
able
to
come
to
stornham
was
greatly
interested
and
naturally
desirous
of
seeing
the
work
begun
her
father
also
would
be
interested
since
it
was
not
possible
to
consult
sir
nigel
it
had
seemed
proper
to
consult
his
solicitors
in
whose
hands
the
estate
had
been
for
so
long
a
time
she
was
aware
it
seemed
that
not
only
townlinson
but
father
and
also
his
grandfather
had
legally
represented
the
anstruthers
as
well
as
many
other
families
as
there
seemed
no
necessity
for
any
structural
changes
and
the
work
done
was
such
as
could
only
rescue
and
increase
the
value
of
the
estate
could
there
be
any
objection
to
its
being
begun
without
delay
certainly
an
unusual
young
lady
it
would
be
interesting
to
discover
how
well
she
knew
sir
nigel
since
it
seemed
that
only
a
knowledge
of
him
his
temper
his
bitter
irritable
vanity
could
have
revealed
to
her
the
necessity
of
the
precaution
she
was
taking
without
even
intimating
that
it
was
a
precaution
extraordinarily
clever
girl
townlinson
wore
an
air
of
quiet
reflection
you
are
aware
miss
vanderpoel
that
the
present
income
from
the
estate
is
not
such
as
would
justify
anything
approaching
the
required
expenditure
yes
i
am
aware
of
that
the
expense
would
be
provided
for
by
my
most
generous
on
vanderpoel
part
townlinson
commented
the
estate
would
of
course
increase
greatly
in
circumstances
had
prevented
her
father
from
visiting
stornham
miss
vanderpoel
explained
and
this
had
led
to
his
being
ignorant
of
a
condition
of
things
which
he
might
have
remedied
she
did
not
explain
what
the
particular
circumstances
which
had
separated
the
families
had
been
but
townlinson
thought
he
understood
the
condition
existing
could
be
remedied
now
if
townlinson
sheppard
saw
no
obstacles
other
than
scarcity
of
money
townlinson
summing
up
of
the
matter
expressed
in
effect
that
he
saw
none
the
estate
had
been
a
fine
one
in
its
day
during
the
last
sixty
years
it
had
become
much
impoverished
with
conservative
decorum
of
manner
he
admitted
that
there
had
not
been
since
sir
marriage
sufficient
reason
for
the
neglect
of
dilapidations
the
firm
had
strongly
represented
to
sir
nigel
that
certain
resources
should
not
be
diverted
from
the
proper
object
of
restoring
the
property
which
was
entailed
upon
his
son
the
son
future
should
beyond
all
have
been
considered
in
the
dispensing
of
his
mother
fortune
he
by
this
time
comprehended
fully
that
he
need
restrain
no
dignified
expression
of
opinion
in
his
speech
with
this
young
lady
she
had
come
to
consult
with
him
with
as
clear
a
view
of
the
proprieties
and
discretions
demanded
by
his
position
as
he
had
himself
and
yet
each
before
the
close
of
the
interview
understood
the
point
of
view
of
the
other
what
he
recognised
was
that
though
she
had
not
seen
sir
nigel
since
her
childhood
she
had
in
some
astonishing
way
obtained
an
extraordinary
insight
into
his
character
and
it
was
this
which
had
led
her
to
take
her
present
step
she
might
not
realise
all
she
might
have
to
contend
with
but
her
conservative
and
formal
action
had
surrounded
her
and
her
sister
with
a
certain
barrier
of
conventional
protection
at
once
dignified
and
astutely
intelligent
since
as
you
say
no
structural
changes
are
proposed
such
as
an
owner
might
resent
and
as
lady
anstruthers
is
the
mother
of
the
heir
and
as
lady
anstruthers
father
undertakes
to
defray
all
expenditure
no
sane
man
could
object
to
the
restoration
of
the
property
to
do
so
would
be
to
cause
public
opinion
to
express
itself
strongly
against
him
such
action
would
place
him
grossly
in
the
then
he
added
with
deliberation
realising
that
he
was
committing
himself
and
feeling
firmly
willing
to
do
so
for
reasons
of
his
own
sir
nigel
is
a
man
who
objects
strongly
to
putting
himself
publicly
in
the
thank
you
said
miss
vanderpoel
he
had
said
this
of
intention
for
her
enlightenment
and
she
was
aware
that
he
had
done
so
this
will
not
be
the
first
time
that
american
fortunes
have
restored
english
estates
townlinson
continued
amiably
there
have
been
many
notable
cases
of
late
years
we
shall
be
happy
to
place
ourselves
at
your
disposal
at
all
times
miss
vanderpoel
we
are
obliged
to
you
for
your
consideration
in
the
thank
you
said
miss
vanderpoel
again
i
wished
to
be
sure
that
i
should
not
be
infringing
any
english
rule
i
had
no
knowledge
you
will
be
infringing
none
you
have
been
most
correct
and
before
she
went
away
townlinson
felt
that
he
had
been
greatly
enlightened
as
to
what
a
young
lady
might
know
and
be
she
gave
him
singularly
clear
details
as
to
what
was
proposed
there
was
so
much
to
be
done
that
he
found
himself
opening
his
eyes
slightly
once
or
twice
but
of
course
if
vanderpoel
was
prepared
to
spend
money
in
a
lavish
manner
it
was
all
to
the
good
so
far
as
the
estate
was
concerned
they
were
stupendous
these
people
and
after
all
the
heir
was
his
grandson
and
how
striking
it
was
that
with
all
this
power
and
readiness
to
use
it
was
evidently
combined
even
in
this
beautiful
young
person
the
clearest
business
sense
of
the
situation
what
was
done
would
be
for
the
comfort
of
lady
anstruthers
and
the
future
of
her
son
sir
nigel
being
unable
to
sell
either
house
or
lands
could
not
undo
it
when
townlinson
accompanied
his
visitor
to
her
carriage
with
dignified
politeness
he
felt
somewhat
like
an
elderly
solicitor
who
had
found
himself
drawn
into
the
atmosphere
of
a
sort
of
intensely
modern
fairy
tale
he
saw
two
of
his
under
clerks
with
the
impropriety
of
youth
looking
out
of
an
office
window
at
the
dark
blue
brougham
and
the
tall
young
lady
whose
beauty
bloomed
in
the
sunshine
he
did
not
on
the
whole
wonder
at
though
he
deplored
the
conduct
of
the
young
men
but
they
of
course
saw
only
what
they
colloquially
described
to
each
other
as
a
rippin
handsome
they
knew
nothing
of
the
interesting
interview
he
himself
returned
to
his
private
room
in
a
musing
mood
and
thought
it
all
over
his
mind
dwelling
on
various
features
of
the
international
situation
and
more
than
once
he
said
aloud
most
remarkable
very
remarkable
chapter

the
fifteenth

james
hubert
john
fergus

fifteenth

of
mount
dunstan
jem
salter
as
his
neighbours
on
the
western
ranches
had
called
him
the
passenger
of
the
meridiana
sat
in
the
great
library
of
his
desolate
great
house
and
stared
fixedly
through
the
open
window
at
the
lovely
land
spread
out
before
him
from
this
particular
window
was
to
be
seen
one
of
the
greatest
views
in
england
from
the
upper
nurseries
he
had
lived
in
as
a
child
he
had
seen
it
every
day
from
morning
until
night
and
it
had
seemed
to
his
young
fancy
to
cover
all
the
plains
of
the
earth
surely
the
rest
of
the
world
he
had
thought
could
be
but
small
though
somewhere
he
knew
there
was
london
where
the
queen
lived
and
in
london
were
buckingham
palace
and
james
palace
and
kensington
and
the
tower
where
heads
had
been
chopped
off
and
the
horse
guards
where
splendid
plumed
soldiers
rode
forth
glittering
with
thrilling
trumpets
sounding
as
they
moved
these
last
he
always
remembered
because
he
had
seen
them
and
once
when
he
had
walked
in
the
park
with
his
nurse
there
had
been
an
excited
stir
in
the
row
and
people
had
crowded
about
a
certain
gate
through
which
an
escorted
carriage
had
been
driven
and
he
had
been
made
at
once
to
take
off
his
hat
and
stand
bareheaded
until
it
passed
because
it
was
the
queen
somehow
from
that
afternoon
he
dated
the
first
presentation
of
certain
vaguely
miserable
ideas
inquiries
made
of
his
attendant
when
the
cortege
had
swept
by
had
elicited
the
fact
that
the
royal
lady
herself
had
children
little
boys
who
were
princes
and
little
girls
who
were
princesses
what
curious
and
persistent
child
on
his
part
had
drawn
forth
the
fact
that
almost
all
the
people
who
drove
about
and
looked
so
happy
and
brilliant
were
the
fathers
or
mothers
of
little
boys
like
yet
in
some
mysterious
way
unlike
himself
and
in
what
manner
had
he
gathered
that
he
was
different
from
them
his
nurse
it
is
true
was
not
a
pleasant
person
and
had
an
injured
and
resentful
bearing
in
later
years
he
realised
that
it
had
been
the
bearing
of
an
irregularly
paid
menial
who
rebelled
against
the
fact
that
her
place
was
not
among
people
who
were
of
distinction
and
high
repute
and
whose
households
bestowed
a
certain
social
status
upon
their
servitors
she
was
a
tall
woman
with
a
sour
face
and
a
bearing
which
conveyed
a
glum
endurance
of
a
position
beneath
her
yes
it
had
been
from
her
brough
her
name
was
that
he
had
mysteriously
gathered
that
he
was
not
a
desirable
charge
as
regarded
from
the
point
of
the
servants
hall
or
in
fact
from
any
other
point
his
people
were
not
the
people
whose
patronage
was
sought
with
anxious
eagerness
for
some
reason
their
town
house
was
objectionable
and
mount
dunstan
was
without
attractions
other
big
houses
were
in
some
marked
way
different
the
town
house
he
objected
to
himself
as
being
gloomy
and
ugly
and
possessing
only
a
bare
and
battered
nursery
from
whose
windows
one
could
not
even
obtain
a
satisfactory
view
of
the
mews
where
at
least
there
were
horses
and
grooms
who
hissed
cheerfully
while
they
curried
and
brushed
them
he
hated
the
town
house
and
was
in
fact
very
glad
that
he
was
scarcely
ever
taken
to
it
people
it
seemed
did
not
care
to
come
either
to
the
town
house
or
to
mount
dunstan
that
was
why
he
did
not
know
other
little
boys
again
for
the
mysterious
reason
people
did
not
care
that
their
children
should
associate
with
him
how
did
he
discover
this
he
never
knew
exactly
he
realised
however
that
without
distinct
statements
he
seemed
to
have
gathered
it
through
various
disconnected
talks
with
brough
she
had
not
remained
with
him
long
having
bettered
herself
greatly
and
gone
away
in
glum
satisfaction
but
she
had
stayed
long
enough
to
convey
to
him
things
which
became
part
of
his
existence
and
smouldered
in
his
little
soul
until
they
became
part
of
himself
the
ancestors
who
had
hewn
their
way
through
their
enemies
with
who
had
been
fierce
and
cruel
and
unconquerable
in
their
savage
pride
had
handed
down
to
him
a
burning
and
unsubmissive
soul
at
six
years
old
walking
with
brough
in
kensington
gardens
and
seeing
other
children
playing
under
the
care
of
nurses
who
he
learned
were
not
inclined
to
make
advances
to
his
attendant
he
dragged
brough
away
with
a
fierce
little
hand
and
stood
apart
with
her
scowling
haughtily
his
head
in
the
air
pretending
that
he
disdained
all
childish
gambols
and
would
have
declined
to
join
in
them
even
if
he
had
been
besought
to
so
far
unbend
bitterness
had
been
planted
in
him
then
though
he
had
not
understood
and
the
sourness
of
brough
had
been
connected
with
no
intelligence
which
might
have
caused
her
to
suspect
his
feelings
and
no
one
had
noticed
and
if
anyone
had
noticed
no
one
would
have
cared
in
the
very
least
when
brough
had
gone
away
to
her
far
superior
place
and
she
had
been
succeeded
by
one
variety
of
objectionable
or
incompetent
person
after
another
he
had
still
continued
to
learn
in
different
ways
he
silently
collected
information
and
all
of
it
was
unpleasant
and
as
he
grew
older
it
took
for
some
years
one
form
lack
of
resources
which
should
of
right
belong
to
persons
of
rank
was
the
radical
objection
to
his
people
at
the
town
house
there
was
no
money
at
mount
dunstan
there
was
no
money
there
had
been
so
little
money
even
in
his
grandfather
time
that
his
father
had
inherited
comparative
beggary
the
fourteenth
earl
of
mount
dunstan
did
not
call
it
comparative
beggary
he
called
it
beggary
pure
and
simple
and
cursed
his
progenitors
with
engaging
frankness
he
never
referred
to
the
fact
that
in
his
personable
youth
he
had
married
a
wife
whose
fortune
if
it
had
not
been
squandered
might
have
restored
his
own
the
fortune
had
been
squandered
in
the
course
of
a
few
years
of
riotous
living
the
wife
had
died
when
her
third
son
was
born
which
event
took
place
ten
years
after
the
birth
of
her
second
whom
she
had
lost
through
scarlet
fever
james
hubert
john
fergus
saltyre
never
heard
much
of
her
and
barely
knew
of
her
past
existence
because
in
the
picture
gallery
he
had
seen
a
portrait
of
a
tall
thin
young
lady
with
light
ringlets
and
pearls
round
her
neck
she
had
not
attracted
him
as
a
child
and
the
fact
that
he
gathered
that
she
had
been
his
mother
left
him
entirely
unmoved
she
was
not
a
person
and
indeed
had
been
at
once
irritable
and
worldly
he
would
probably
have
been
no
less
lonely
if
she
had
lived
lonely
he
was
his
father
was
engaged
in
a
career
much
too
lively
and
interesting
to
himself
to
admit
of
his
allowing
himself
to
be
bored
by
an
unwanted
and
entirely
superfluous
child
the
elder
son
who
was
lord
tenham
had
reached
a
premature
and
degenerate
maturity
by
the
time
the
younger
one
made
his
belated
appearance
and
regarded
him
with
unconcealed
dislike
the
worst
thing
which
could
have
befallen
the
younger
boy
would
have
been
intimate
association
with
this
degenerate
youth
as
saltyre
left
nursery
days
behind
he
learned
by
degrees
that
the
objection
to
himself
and
his
people
which
had
at
first
endeavoured
to
explain
itself
as
being
the
result
of
an
unseemly
lack
of
money
combined
with
that
unpleasant
feature
an
uglier
one
namely
lack
of
decent
reputation
angry
duns
beggarliness
of
income
scarcity
of
the
necessaries
and
luxuries
which
dignity
of
rank
demanded
the
indifference
and
slights
of
one
equals
and
the
ignoring
of
existence
by
exalted
persons
were
all
hideous
enough
to
lord
mount
dunstan
and
his
elder
son
but
they
were
not
so
hideous
as
was
to
his
younger
son
the
childish
shamed
frenzy
of
awakening
to
the
truth
that
he
was
one
of
a
bad
lot
a
disgraceful
lot
from
whom
nothing
was
expected
but
shifty
ways
low
vices
and
scandals
which
in
the
end
could
not
even
be
kept
out
of
the
newspapers
the
day
came
in
fact
when
the
worst
of
these
was
seized
upon
by
them
and
filled
their
sheets
with
matter
which
for
a
whole
season
decent
london
avoided
reading
and
the
fast
and
indecent
element
laughed
derided
or
gloated
over
the
memory
of
the
fever
of
the
monstrous
weeks
which
had
passed
at
this
time
was
not
one
it
was
wise
for
a
man
to
recall
but
it
was
not
to
be
forgotten
the
hasty
midnight
arrival
at
mount
dunstan
of
father
and
son
their
haggard
nervous
faces
their
terrified
discussions
and
argumentative
raging
when
they
were
shut
up
together
behind
locked
doors
the
appearance
of
legal
advisers
who
looked
as
anxious
as
themselves
but
failed
to
conceal
the
disgust
with
which
they
were
battling
the
knowledge
that
tongues
were
clacking
almost
hysterically
in
the
village
and
that
curious
faces
hurried
to
the
windows
when
even
a
menial
from
the
great
house
passed
the
atmosphere
of
whispers
and
jogged
elbows
and
winks
and
giggles
the
final
desperate
excited
preparations
for
flight
which
might
be
ignominiously
stopped
at
any
moment
by
the
intervention
of
the
law
the
huddling
away
at
night
time
the
fear
that
the
shameful
move
might
be
too
late
the
burning
humiliation
of
knowing
the
inevitable
result
of
public
contempt
or
laughter
when
the
world
next
day
heard
that
the
fugitives
had
put
the
english
channel
between
themselves
and
their
country
laws
lord
tenham
had
died
a
few
years
later
at
port
said
after
descending
into
all
the
hells
of
degenerate
debauch
his
father
had
lived
longer
long
enough
to
make
of
himself
something
horribly
near
an
imbecile
before
he
died
suddenly
in
paris
the
mount
dunstan
who
succeeded
him
having
spent
his
childhood
and
boyhood
under
the
shadow
of
the
bad
lot
had
the
character
of
being
a
big
surly
unattractive
young
fellow
whose
eccentricity
presented
itself
to
those
who
knew
his
stock
as
being
of
a
kind
which
might
develop
at
any
time
into
any
objectionable
tendency
his
bearing
was
not
such
as
allured
and
his
fortune
was
not
of
the
order
which
placed
a
man
in
the
view
of
the
world
he
had
no
money
to
expend
no
hospitalities
to
offer
and
apparently
no
disposition
to
connect
himself
with
society
his
chase
to
america
had
when
it
had
been
considered
worth
while
discussing
at
all
been
regarded
as
being
very
much
the
kind
of
thing
a
mount
dunstan
might
do
with
some
secret
and
disreputable
end
in
view
no
one
had
heard
the
exact
truth
and
no
one
would
have
been
inclined
to
believe
if
they
had
heard
it
that
he
had
lived
as
plain
jem
salter
and
laboured
as
any
hind
might
have
done
in
desperate
effort
and
mad
hope
would
not
have
been
regarded
as
a
fact
to
be
credited
he
had
gone
away
he
had
squandered
money
he
had
returned
he
was
at
mount
dunstan
again
living
the
life
of
an
objectionable
recluse
objectionable
because
the
owner
of
a
place
like
mount
dunstan
should
be
a
power
and
an
influence
in
the
county
should
be
counted
upon
as
a
dispenser
of
hospitalities
as
a
supporter
of
charities
as
a
dignitary
of
weight
he
was
none
of
these
living
no
one
knew
how
slouching
about
with
his
gun
riding
or
walking
sullenly
over
the
roads
and
marshland
just
one
man
knew
him
intimately
and
this
one
had
been
from
his
fifteenth
year
the
sole
friend
of
his
life
he
had
come
then
the
reverend
lewis
penzance
a
poor
and
unhealthy
scholar
to
be
vicar
of
the
parish
of
dunstan
only
a
poor
and
man
would
have
accepted
the
position
what
this
man
wanted
was
no
more
than
quiet
pure
country
air
to
fill
frail
lungs
a
roof
over
his
head
and
a
place
to
pore
over
books
and
manuscripts
he
was
a
born
monk
and
celibate
in
centuries
he
would
have
lived
peacefully
in
some
monastery
spending
his
years
in
the
reading
and
writing
of
black
letter
and
the
illuminating
of
missals
at
the
vicarage
he
could
lead
an
existence
which
was
almost
the
same
thing
at
mount
dunstan
there
remained
still
the
large
remnant
of
a
great
library
a
huge
room
whose
neglected
and
half
emptied
shelves
contained
some
strange
things
and
wonderful
ones
though
all
were
in
disorder
and
given
up
to
dust
and
natural
dilapidation
inevitably
the
reverend
lewis
penzance
had
found
his
way
there
inevitably
he
had
gained
indifferently
bestowed
permission
to
entertain
himself
by
endeavouring
to
reduce
to
order
and
to
make
an
attempt
at
cataloguing
inevitably
also
the
hours
he
spent
in
the
place
became
the
chief
sustenance
of
his
being
there
one
day
he
had
come
upon
an
boy
with
deep
eyes
and
a
shaggy
crop
of
red
hair
the
boy
was
poring
over
an
old
volume
and
was
plainly
not
disposed
to
leave
it
he
rose
not
too
graciously
and
replied
to
the
elder
man
greeting
and
the
friendly
questions
which
followed
yes
he
was
the
youngest
son
of
the
house
he
had
nothing
to
do
and
he
liked
the
library
he
often
came
there
and
sat
and
read
things
there
were
some
queer
old
books
and
a
lot
of
stupid
ones
the
book
he
was
reading
now
oh
that
with
a
slight
reddening
of
his
skin
and
a
little
awkwardness
at
the
admission
was
one
of
those
he
liked
best
it
was
one
of
the
queer
ones
but
interesting
for
all
that
it
was
about
their
own
people
the
generations
of
mount
dunstans
who
had
lived
in
the
centuries
past
he
supposed
he
liked
it
because
there
were
a
lot
of
odd
stories
and
exciting
things
in
it
plenty
of
fighting
and
adventure
there
had
been
some
splendid
fellows
among
them
he
was
beginning
to
forget
himself
a
little
by
this
time
they
were
afraid
of
nothing
they
were
rather
like
savages
in
the
earliest
days
but
at
that
time
all
the
rest
of
the
world
was
savage
but
they
were
brave
and
it
was
odd
how
decent
they
were
very
often
what
he
meant
was
what
he
liked
was
that
they
were
men
even
when
they
were
barbarians
you
could
be
ashamed
of
them
things
they
did
then
could
not
be
done
now
because
the
world
was
different
but
if
well
the
kind
of
men
they
were
might
do
england
a
lot
of
good
if
they
were
alive
they
would
be
different
themselves
of
course
in
one
way
but
they
must
be
the
same
men
in
others
perhaps
penzance
reddening
again
understood
what
he
meant
he
knew
himself
very
well
because
he
had
thought
it
all
out
he
was
always
thinking
about
it
but
he
was
no
good
at
explaining
penzance
was
interested
his
outlook
on
the
past
and
the
present
had
always
been
that
of
a
bookworm
but
he
understood
enough
to
see
that
he
had
come
upon
a
temperament
novel
enough
to
awaken
curiosity
the
apparently
entirely
neglected
boy
of
a
type
singularly
unlike
that
of
his
father
and
elder
brother
living
his
life
virtually
alone
in
the
big
place
and
finding
food
to
his
taste
in
stories
of
those
of
his
blood
whose
dust
had
mingled
with
the
earth
centuries
ago
provided
him
with
a
new
subject
for
reflection
that
had
been
the
beginning
of
an
unusual
friendship
gradually
penzance
had
reached
a
clear
understanding
of
all
the
building
of
the
young
life
of
its
rankling
humiliation
and
the
qualities
of
mind
and
body
which
made
for
rebellion
it
sometimes
thrilled
him
to
see
in
the
big
frame
and
powerful
muscles
in
the
strong
nature
and
unconquerable
spirit
a
revival
of
what
had
burned
and
stirred
through
lives
lived
in
a
dim
almost
mythical
past
there
were
legends
of
men
with
big
bodies
fierce
faces
and
red
hair
who
had
done
big
deeds
and
conquered
in
dark
and
barbarous
days
even
fate
self
as
it
had
seemed
none
could
overthrow
them
none
could
stand
before
their
determination
to
attain
that
which
they
chose
to
claim
students
of
heredity
knew
that
there
were
curious
instances
of
revival
of
type
there
had
been
a
certain
red
godwyn
who
had
ruled
his
piece
of
england
before
the
conqueror
came
and
who
had
defied
the
interloper
with
such
splendid
arrogance
and
superhuman
lack
of
fear
that
he
had
won
in
the
end
strangely
enough
the
admiration
and
friendship
of
the
royal
savage
himself
who
saw
in
his
a
kindred
savagery
a
power
to
be
well
ranged
through
love
if
not
through
fear
upon
his
own
side
this
godwyn
had
a
deep
attraction
for
his
descendant
who
knew
the
whole
story
of
his
fierce
life
as
told
in
one
yellow
manuscript
and
another
by
heart
why
might
not
one
fancy
penzance
was
drawn
by
the
imagining
this
strong
thing
reborn
even
as
the
offspring
of
a
poorer
effete
type
red
godwyn
springing
into
being
again
had
been
stronger
than
all
else
and
had
swept
weakness
before
him
as
he
had
done
in
other
and
days
in
the
old
library
it
fell
out
in
time
that
penzance
and
the
boy
spent
the
greater
part
of
their
days
the
man
was
a
bookworm
and
a
scholar
young
saltyre
had
a
passion
for
knowledge
among
the
old
books
and
manuscripts
he
gained
a
singular
education
without
a
guide
he
could
not
have
gathered
and
assimilated
all
he
did
gather
and
assimilate
together
the
two
rummaged
forgotten
shelves
and
chests
and
found
forgotten
things
that
which
had
drawn
the
boy
from
the
first
always
drew
and
absorbed
him
the
annals
of
his
own
people
many
a
long
winter
evening
the
pair
turned
over
the
pages
of
volumes
and
of
parchment
and
followed
with
eager
interest
and
curiosity
the
records
of
wild
lives
stories
of
warriors
and
abbots
and
bards
of
feudal
lords
at
ruthless
war
with
each
other
of
besiegings
and
battles
and
captives
and
torments
legends
there
were
of
small
kingdoms
torn
asunder
of
the
slaughter
of
their
kings
the
mad
fightings
of
their
barons
and
the
faith
or
unfaith
of
their
serfs
here
and
there
the
eternal
power
revealed
itself
in
some
story
of
lawful
or
unlawful
love
for
dame
or
damsel
royal
lady
abbess
or
nun
ending
in
the
welding
of
two
lives
or
in
rapine
violence
and
death
there
were
annals
of
early
england
and
of
marauders
monks
and
danes
and
through
all
these
some
thing
some
man
or
woman
place
or
strife
linked
by
some
tie
with
mount
dunstan
blood
in
past
generations
it
seemed
plain
there
had
been
certain
of
the
line
who
had
had
pride
in
these
records
and
had
sought
and
collected
them
then
had
been
born
others
who
had
not
cared
sometimes
the
relations
were
inadequate
sometimes
they
wore
an
unauthentic
air
but
most
of
them
seemed
even
after
the
passing
of
centuries
human
documents
and
together
built
a
marvellous
great
drama
of
life
and
power
wickedness
and
passion
and
daring
deeds
when
the
shameful
scandal
burst
forth
young
saltyre
was
seen
by
neither
his
father
nor
his
brother
neither
of
them
had
any
desire
to
see
him
in
fact
each
detested
the
idea
of
confronting
by
any
chance
his
hot
intolerant
eyes
the
brat
his
father
had
called
him
in
his
childhood
the
lout
when
he
had
grown
and
clumsy
both
he
and
tenham
were
sick
enough
without
being
called
upon
to
contemplate
the
lout
whose
opinion
in
any
case
they
preferred
not
to
hear
saltyre
during
the
hideous
days
shut
himself
up
in
the
library
he
did
not
leave
the
house
even
for
exercise
until
after
the
pair
had
fled
his
exercise
he
took
in
walking
up
and
down
from
one
end
of
the
long
room
to
another
devils
were
let
loose
in
him
when
penzance
came
to
him
he
saw
their
fury
in
his
eyes
and
heard
it
in
the
savagery
of
his
laugh
he
kicked
an
ancient
volume
out
of
his
way
as
he
strode
to
and
fro
there
has
been
plenty
of
the
blood
of
the
beast
in
us
in
bygone
times
he
said
but
it
was
not
like
this
savagery
in
savage
days
had
its
excuse
this
is
the
beast
sunk
into
the
gibbering
degenerate
penzance
came
and
spent
hours
of
each
day
with
him
part
of
his
rage
was
the
rage
of
a
man
but
he
was
a
boy
still
and
the
boyishness
of
his
bitterly
hurt
youth
was
a
thing
to
move
to
pity
with
young
blood
and
young
pride
and
young
expectancy
rising
within
him
he
was
at
an
hour
when
he
should
have
felt
himself
standing
upon
the
threshold
of
the
world
gazing
out
at
the
splendid
joys
and
promises
and
powerful
deeds
of
it
waiting
only
the
fit
moment
to
step
forth
and
win
his
place
but
we
are
done
for
he
shouted
once
we
are
done
for
and
i
am
as
much
done
for
as
they
are
decent
people
wo
touch
us
that
is
where
the
last
mount
dunstan
and
penzance
heard
in
his
voice
an
absolute
break
he
stopped
and
marched
to
the
window
at
the
end
of
the
long
room
and
stood
in
dead
stillness
staring
out
at
the
lines
of
heavy
rain
the
older
man
thought
many
things
as
he
looked
at
his
big
back
and
body
he
stood
with
his
legs
astride
and
penzance
noted
that
his
right
hand
was
clenched
on
his
hip
as
a
man
might
be
as
he
clenched
the
hilt
of
his
sword
his
one
mate
who
might
avenge
him
even
when
standing
at
bay
he
knew
that
the
end
had
come
and
he
must
fall
primeval
force
the
slightly
bald
clergyman
of
the
church
of
england
was
thinking
never
loses
its
way
or
fails
to
sweep
a
path
before
it
the
sun
rises
and
sets
the
seasons
come
and
go
primeval
force
is
of
them
and
as
unchangeable
much
of
it
stood
before
him
embodied
in
this
strongly
sentient
thing
in
this
way
the
reverend
lewis
found
his
thoughts
leading
him
and
he
being
moved
to
the
depths
of
a
fine
soul
felt
them
profoundly
interesting
and
even
sustaining
he
sat
in
a
chair
holding
its
arms
with
long
thin
hands
and
looking
for
some
time
at
james
hubert
john
fergus
saltyre
he
said
at
last
in
a
sane
level
voice
lord
tenham
is
not
the
last
mount
after
which
the
stillness
remained
unbroken
again
for
some
minutes
saltyre
did
not
move
or
make
any
response
and
when
he
left
his
place
at
the
window
he
took
up
a
book
and
they
spoke
of
other
things
when
the
fourteenth
earl
died
in
paris
and
his
younger
son
succeeded
there
came
a
time
when
the
two
companions
sat
together
in
the
library
again
it
was
the
evening
of
a
long
day
spent
in
discouraging
hard
work
in
the
morning
they
had
ridden
side
by
side
over
the
estate
in
the
afternoon
they
had
sat
and
pored
over
accounts
leases
maps
plans
by
nightfall
both
were
fagged
and
neither
in
sanguine
mood
mount
dunstan
had
sat
silent
for
some
time
the
pair
often
sat
silent
this
pause
was
ended
by
the
young
man
rising
and
standing
up
stretching
his
limbs
it
was
a
queer
thing
you
said
to
me
in
this
room
a
few
years
ago
he
said
it
has
just
come
back
to
singularly
enough
or
perhaps
naturally
enough
it
had
also
just
arisen
again
from
the
depths
of
penzance
subconsciousness
yes
he
answered
i
remember
it
suggests
premonition
your
brother
was
not
the
last
mount
in
one
sense
he
never
was
mount
dunstan
at
all
answered
the
other
man
then
he
suddenly
threw
out
his
arms
in
a
gesture
whose
whole
significance
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
describe
there
was
a
kind
of
passion
in
it
i
am
the
last
mount
dunstan
he
harshly
laughed
moi
qui
vous
parle
the
penzance
eyes
resting
on
him
took
upon
themselves
the
look
of
a
man
who
watches
the
world
of
life
without
living
in
it
he
presently
shook
his
head
no
he
said
i
do
see
that
no
not
the
last
believe
and
singularly
in
truth
mount
dunstan
stood
still
and
gazed
at
him
without
speaking
the
eyes
of
each
rested
in
the
eyes
of
the
other
and
as
had
happened
before
they
followed
the
subject
no
further
from
that
moment
it
dropped
only
penzance
had
known
of
his
reasons
for
going
to
america
even
the
family
solicitors
gravely
holding
interviews
with
him
and
restraining
expression
of
their
absolute
disapproval
of
such
employment
of
his
inadequate
resources
knew
no
more
than
that
this
mount
dunstan
instead
of
wasting
his
beggarly
income
at
cairo
or
monte
carlo
or
in
paris
as
the
last
one
had
done
prefers
to
waste
it
in
newer
places
the
head
of
the
firm
when
he
bids
him
and
leaves
him
alone
merely
shrugs
his
shoulders
and
returns
to
his
letter
writing
with
the
corners
of
his
elderly
mouth
hard
set
penzance
saw
him
off
and
met
him
upon
his
return
in
the
library
they
sat
and
talked
it
over
and
having
done
so
closed
the
book
of
the
episode
he
sat
at
the
table
his
eyes
upon
the
loveliness
of
the
landscape
but
his
thought
elsewhere
it
wandered
over
the
years
already
lived
through
wandering
backwards
even
to
the
days
when
existence
opening
before
the
child
eyes
was
a
baffling
and
vaguely
unhappy
thing
when
the
door
opened
and
penzance
was
ushered
in
by
a
servant
his
face
wore
the
look
his
friend
would
have
been
rejoiced
to
see
swept
away
to
return
no
more
then
let
us
take
our
old
accustomed
seat
and
begin
some
casual
talk
which
will
draw
him
out
of
the
shadows
and
make
him
forget
such
things
as
it
is
not
good
to
remember
that
is
what
we
have
done
many
times
in
the
past
and
may
find
it
well
to
do
many
a
time
again
he
begins
with
talk
of
the
village
and
the
village
stories
are
often
quaint
and
stories
of
the
countryside
are
sometimes
not
always
interesting
tom
benson
wife
has
presented
him
with
triplets
and
there
is
great
excitement
in
the
village
as
to
the
steps
to
be
taken
to
secure
the
three
guineas
given
by
the
queen
as
a
reward
for
this
feat
old
benny
bates
has
announced
his
intention
of
taking
a
fifth
wife
at
the
age
of
ninety
and
is
indignant
that
it
has
been
suggested
that
the
parochial
authorities
in
charge
of
the
union
in
which
he
must
inevitably
shortly
take
refuge
may
interfere
with
his
rights
as
a
citizen
the
reverend
lewis
has
been
to
talk
seriously
with
him
and
finds
him
at
once
irate
and
obdurate
vicar
says
old
benny
he
ca
refuse
to
marry
no
man
law
wo
let
such
refusal
he
intimates
might
drive
him
to
wild
and
riotous
living
remembering
his
last
view
of
old
benny
tottering
down
the
village
street
in
his
white
smock
his
face
like
a
withered
rosy
apple
his
gnarled
hand
grasping
the
knotted
staff
his
bent
body
leaned
on
mount
dunstan
grinned
a
little
he
did
not
smile
when
penzance
passed
to
the
restoration
of
the
ancient
church
at
mellowdene
restoration
usually
meant
the
tearing
away
of
ancient
oaken
pews
and
the
instalment
of
smug
new
benches
suggesting
suburban
dissenting
chapels
such
as
the
feudal
soul
revolts
at
neither
did
he
smile
at
a
reference
to
the
gathering
at
dunholm
castle
which
was
twelve
miles
away
dunholm
was
the
possession
of
a
man
who
stood
for
all
that
was
first
and
highest
in
the
land
dignity
learning
exalted
character
generosity
honour
he
and
the
late
lord
mount
dunstan
had
been
born
in
the
same
year
and
had
succeeded
to
their
titles
almost
at
the
same
time
there
had
arrived
a
period
when
they
had
ceased
to
know
each
other
all
that
the
one
man
intrinsically
was
the
other
man
was
not
all
that
the
one
estate
its
castle
its
village
its
tenantry
represented
was
the
antipodes
of
that
which
the
other
stood
for
the
one
possession
held
its
place
a
silent
and
perhaps
unconscious
reproach
to
the
other
among
the
guests
forming
the
large
house
party
which
london
social
news
had
already
recorded
in
its
columns
were
great
and
honourable
persons
and
interesting
ones
men
and
women
who
counted
as
factors
in
all
good
and
dignified
things
accomplished
even
in
the
present
mount
dunstan
childhood
people
of
their
world
had
ceased
to
cross
his
father
threshold
as
one
or
two
of
the
most
noticeable
names
were
mentioned
mentally
he
recalled
this
and
penzance
quick
to
see
the
thought
in
his
eyes
changed
the
subject
at
stornham
village
an
unexpected
thing
has
happened
he
said
one
of
the
relatives
of
lady
anstruthers
has
suddenly
appeared
a
sister
you
may
remember
that
the
poor
woman
was
said
to
be
the
daughter
of
some
rich
american
and
it
seemed
unexplainable
that
none
of
her
family
ever
appeared
and
things
were
allowed
to
go
from
bad
to
worse
as
it
was
understood
that
there
was
so
much
money
people
were
mystified
by
the
condition
of
anstruthers
has
had
money
to
squander
said
mount
dunstan
tenham
and
he
were
intimates
the
money
he
spends
is
no
doubt
his
wife
as
her
family
deserted
her
she
has
no
one
to
defend
certainly
her
family
has
seemed
to
neglect
her
for
years
perhaps
they
were
disappointed
in
his
position
many
americans
are
extremely
ambitious
these
international
marriages
are
often
singular
things
now
apparently
without
having
been
expected
the
sister
appears
vanderpoel
is
the
name
miss
i
crossed
the
atlantic
with
her
in
the
meridiana
said
mount
dunstan
indeed
that
is
interesting
you
did
not
of
course
know
that
she
was
coming
i
knew
nothing
of
her
but
that
she
was
a
saloon
passenger
with
a
suite
of
staterooms
and
i
was
in
the
second
cabin
nothing
that
is
not
quite
true
perhaps
stewards
and
passengers
gossip
and
one
can
not
close
one
ears
of
course
one
heard
constant
reiteration
of
the
number
of
millions
her
father
possessed
and
the
number
of
cabins
she
managed
to
occupy
during
the
confusion
and
alarm
of
the
collision
we
spoke
to
each
he
did
not
mention
the
other
occasion
on
which
he
had
seen
her
there
seemed
on
the
whole
no
special
reason
why
he
should
then
you
would
recognise
her
if
you
saw
her
i
heard
that
she
seems
an
unusual
young
woman
and
has
her
eyes
and
lashes
are
remarkable
she
is
tall
the
americans
are
setting
up
a
new
yes
they
used
to
send
over
slender
fragile
little
women
lady
anstruthers
was
the
type
i
confess
to
an
interest
in
the
why
she
has
made
a
curious
impression
she
has
begun
to
do
things
stornham
village
has
lost
its
he
laughed
a
little
she
has
been
going
over
the
place
and
discussing
mount
dunstan
laughed
also
he
remembered
what
she
had
said
and
she
had
actually
begun
that
is
practical
he
commented
it
is
really
interesting
why
should
a
young
woman
turn
her
attention
to
repairs
if
it
had
been
her
father
the
omnipotent
vanderpoel
who
had
appeared
one
would
not
have
wondered
at
such
practical
activity
but
a
young
lady
with
remarkable
eyelashes
his
elbows
were
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
and
he
had
placed
the
tips
of
his
fingers
together
wearing
an
expression
of
such
absorbed
contemplation
that
mount
dunstan
laughed
again
you
look
quite
dreamy
over
it
he
said
it
allures
me
unknown
quantities
in
character
always
allure
me
i
should
like
to
know
her
a
community
like
this
is
made
up
of
the
absolutely
known
quantity
of
types
repeating
themselves
through
centuries
a
new
one
is
almost
a
startling
thing
gossip
over
teacups
is
not
usually
entertaining
to
me
but
i
found
myself
listening
to
little
miss
laura
brunel
this
afternoon
with
rather
marked
attention
i
confess
to
having
gone
so
far
as
to
make
an
inquiry
or
so
sir
nigel
anstruthers
is
not
often
at
stornham
he
is
away
now
it
is
plainly
not

is
on

in
retreat
in
a
place
he
is
fond
of

drily
he
took
a
companion
with
him
a
new
infatuation

a
suite
of
rooms
was
engaged
for
them
the
luxury
which
surrounded
them
was
not
of
the
order
rosalie
had
vaguely
connected
with
hotels
had
apparently
learned
many
things
during
the
years
of
her
seclusion
vanderpoels
at
least
could
so
establish
themselves
as
not
to
greatly
feel
the
hotel
atmosphere
carefully
chosen
colours
textures
and
appointments
formed
the
background
of
their
days
the
food
they
ate
was
a
thing
produced
by
art
the
servants
who
attended
them
were
mechanisms
to
sit
by
a
window
and
watch
the
kaleidoscopic
human
tide
passing
by
on
its
way
to
its
pleasure
to
reach
its
work
to
spend
its
money
in
unending
shops
to
show
itself
and
its
equipage
in
the
park
was
a
wonderful
thing
to
lady
anstruthers
it
all
seemed
to
be
a
part
of
the
life
and
quality
of
betty
little
betty
whom
she
had
remembered
only
as
a
child
and
who
had
come
to
her
a
tall
strong
young
beauty
who
had
it
was
resplendently
clear
never
known
a
fear
in
her
life
and
whose
mere
personality
had
the
effect
of
making
fears
seem
unreal
she
was
taken
out
in
a
luxurious
little
brougham
to
shops
whose
varied
allurements
were
placed
eagerly
at
her
disposal
respectful
persons
obedient
to
her
most
desire
displayed
garments
as
wonderful
as
those
the
new
york
trunks
had
revealed
she
was
besought
to
consider
the
fitness
of
articles
whose
exquisiteness
she
was
almost
afraid
to
look
at
her
thin
little
body
was
wonderfully
fitted
managed
encouraged
to
make
the
most
of
its
outlines
her
ladyship
slenderness
is
a
great
advantage
said
the
wisely
inciting
ones
there
is
no
such
advantage
as
delicacy
of
summing
up
the
character
of
their
customer
with
the
eye
they
realised
the
discretion
of
turning
to
miss
vanderpoel
for
encouragement
though
she
was
the
younger
of
the
two
and
bore
no
title
they
were
aware
of
the
existence
of
persons
of
rank
who
were
not
lavish
patrons
but
the
name
of
vanderpoel
held
most
promising
suggestions
to
an
english
shopkeeper
the
american
has
of
late
years
represented
the
spender
the
type
which
whatsoever
its
rank
and
resources
has
mysteriously
always
money
to
hand
over
counters
in
exchange
for
things
it
chances
to
desire
to
possess
each
year
surges
across
the
atlantic
a
horde
of
these
fortunate
persons
who
to
the
sober
commercial
british
mind
appear
to
be
free
to
devote
their
existences
to
travel
and
expenditure
this
contingent
appears
shopping
in
the
various
shopping
thoroughfares
it
buys
clothes
jewels
miscellaneous
attractive
things
making
its
purchases
of
articles
useful
or
decorative
with
a
freedom
from
anxiety
in
its
enjoyment
which
does
not
mark
the
mood
of
the
ordinary
shopper
in
the
everyday
purchaser
one
is
accustomed
to
take
for
granted
as
a
factor
in
his
expenditure
a
certain
deliberation
and
uncertainty
to
the
travelling
american
in
europe
shopping
appears
to
be
part
of
the
holiday
which
is
being
made
the
most
of
surely
all
the
neat
smart
young
persons
who
buy
frocks
and
blouses
hats
and
coats
hosiery
and
chains
can
not
be
the
possessors
of
large
incomes
there
must
be
even
in
america
a
middle
class
of
resources
yet
these
young
persons
male
and
female
and
most
frequently
unaccompanied
by
older
persons
seeing
what
they
want
greet
it
with
expressions
of
pleasure
waste
no
time
in
appropriating
and
paying
for
it
and
go
away
as
in
relief
and
triumph
not
as
in
that
sober
joy
which
is
clouded
by
afterthought
the
sales
people
are
sometimes
even
vaguely
cheered
by
their
gay
lack
of
any
doubt
as
to
the
wisdom
of
their
getting
what
they
admire
and
rejoicing
in
it
if
america
always
buys
in
this
holiday
mood
it
must
be
an
enviable
thing
to
be
a
shopkeeper
in
their
new
york
or
boston
or
san
francisco
who
would
not
make
a
fortune
among
them
they
want
what
they
want
and
not
something
which
seems
to
them
less
desirable
but
they
open
their
purses
and
frequently
with
some
amused
uncertainty
as
to
the
differences
between
sovereigns
and
florins
and
they
pay
their
bills
with
something
almost
like
glee
they
are
remarkably
prompt
about
bills
which
is
an
excellent
thing
as
they
are
nearly
always
just
going
somewhere
else
to
france
or
germany
or
italy
or
scotland
or
siberia
those
of
us
who
are
shopkeepers
or
their
salesmen
do
not
dream
that
some
of
them
have
incomes
no
larger
than
our
own
that
they
work
for
their
livings
that
they
are
teachers
journalists
small
writers
or
illustrators
of
papers
or
magazines
that
they
are
unimportant
soldiers
of
fortune
but
with
their
queer
american
insistence
on
exploration
and
the
ignoring
of
limitations
they
have
somehow
managed
to
make
this
exultant
dash
for
a
few
daring
weeks
or
months
of
freedom
and
new
experience
if
we
knew
this
we
should
regard
them
from
our
conservative
standpoint
of
provident
decorum
as
improvident
lunatics
being
ourselves
unable
to
calculate
with
their
odd
courage
and
their
cheerful
belief
in
themselves
what
we
do
know
is
that
they
spend
and
we
are
far
from
disdaining
their
patronage
though
most
of
them
have
an
odd
little
familiarity
of
address
and
are
not
stamped
with
that
distinction
which
causes
us
to
realise
the
enormous
difference
between
the
patron
and
the
tradesman
and
makes
us
feel
the
worm
we
remotely
like
to
feel
ourselves
though
we
would
not
for
worlds
acknowledge
the
fact
mentally
and
in
our
speech
both
among
our
equals
and
our
superiors
we
condescend
to
and
patronise
them
a
little
though
that
of
course
is
the
fine
old
insular
attitude
it
would
be
to
discourage
but
if
we
are
not
in
the
least
definite
concerning
the
position
and
resources
of
these
spenders
as
a
mass
we
are
quite
sure
of
a
select
number
there
is
mention
of
them
in
the
newspapers
of
the
town
houses
the
castles
moors
and
salmon
fishings
they
rent
of
their
yachts
their
presentations
actually
at
our
own
courts
of
their
presence
at
great
balls
at
ascot
and
goodwood
at
the
opera
on
gala
nights
one
staggers
sometimes
before
the
public
of
the
amount
of
their
fortunes
these
people
who
have
neither
blood
nor
rank
these
men
who
labour
in
their
business
offices
are
richer
than
our
great
dukes
at
the
realising
of
whose
wealth
and
possessions
we
have
at
times
almost
turned
pale
them
chaffed
a
costermonger
over
his
barrow
blimme
if
some
o
them
blokes
wo
buy
pallis
an
the
fambly
some
when
they
out
the
subservient
attendants
in
more
than
one
fashionable
shop
betty
and
her
sister
visit
know
that
miss
vanderpoel
is
of
the
circle
though
her
father
has
not
as
yet
bought
or
hired
any
great
estate
and
his
daughter
has
not
been
seen
in
london
its
queer
we
never
heard
of
her
being
presented
one
shopgirl
says
to
another
just
you
look
at
she
evidently
knows
what
her
ladyship
ought
to
buy
what
can
be
trusted
not
to
overpower
her
faded
fragility
the
saleswomen
even
if
they
had
not
been
devoured
by
alert
curiosity
could
not
have
avoided
seeing
that
her
ladyship
did
not
seem
to
know
what
should
be
bought
and
that
miss
vanderpoel
did
though
she
did
not
direct
her
sister
selection
but
merely
seemed
to
suggest
with
delicate
restraint
her
taste
was
wonderfully
perceptive
the
things
bought
were
exquisite
but
a
little
colourless
woman
could
wear
them
all
with
advantage
to
her
restrictions
of
type
as
the
brougham
drove
down
bond
street
betty
called
lady
attention
to
more
than
one
look
rosy
she
said
there
is
mrs
treat
hilyar
in
the
second
carriage
to
the
right
you
remember
josie
treat
hilyar
married
lord
varick
in
the
landau
designated
an
elderly
woman
with
white
hair
sat
smiling
and
bowing
to
friends
who
were
walking
lady
anstruthers
despite
her
eagerness
shrank
back
a
little
hoping
to
escape
being
seen
oh
it
is
the
lows
she
is
speaking
to
tom
and
alice
i
did
not
know
they
had
sailed
the
tall
young
man
with
the
nice
ugly
face
was
showing
white
teeth
in
a
gay
smile
of
recognition
and
his
pretty
wife
was
lightly
waving
a
slim
hand
in
a
grey
suede
glove
how
cheerful
and
they
look
said
rosy
tom
was
only
twenty
when
i
saw
him
last
whom
did
he
marry
an
english
girl
such
a
love
a
devonshire
gentleman
daughter
in
new
york
his
friends
called
her
devonshire
cream
and
roses
she
is
one
of
the
pretty
flushy
pink
how
nice
bond
street
is
on
a
spring
morning
like
this
said
lady
anstruthers
you
may
laugh
at
me
for
saying
it
betty
but
somehow
it
seems
to
me
more
than
the
how
clever
of
you
laughed
betty
there
is
so
much
truth
in
the
people
walking
in
the
sunshine
were
all
full
of
spring
thoughts
and
plans
the
colours
they
wore
the
flowers
in
the
women
hats
and
the
men
buttonholes
belonged
to
the
season
the
cheerful
crowds
of
people
and
carriages
had
a
sort
of
rushing
stir
of
movement
which
suggested
freshness
later
in
the
year
everything
looks
more
tired
now
things
were
beginning
and
everyone
was
rather
inclined
to
believe
that
this
year
would
be
better
than
last
look
at
the
shop
windows
said
betty
full
of
whites
and
pinks
and
yellows
and
blues
the
colours
of
hyacinth
and
daffodil
beds
it
seems
as
if
they
insist
that
there
never
has
been
a
winter
and
never
will
be
one
they
insist
that
there
never
was
and
never
will
be
anything
but
it
in
the
lady
anstruthers
sigh
was
actually
a
happy
one
it
is
just
what
i
used
to
feel
in
april
when
we
drove
down
fifth
among
the
crowds
of
women
with
flowery
hats
and
light
frocks
and
parasols
men
with
touches
of
on
the
lapels
of
their
coats
and
the
holiday
look
in
their
faces
she
noted
so
many
of
a
familiar
type
that
she
began
to
look
for
and
try
to
pick
them
out
with
quite
excited
interest
i
believe
that
woman
is
an
american
she
would
say
that
girl
looks
as
if
she
were
a
new
yorker
again
that
man
face
looks
as
if
it
belonged
to
broadway
oh
betty
do
you
think
i
am
right
i
should
say
those
girls
getting
out
of
the
hansom
to
go
into
burnham
staples
came
from
out
west
and
are
going
to
buy
thousands
of
things
do
they
look
like
it
she
began
to
lean
forward
and
look
on
at
things
with
an
interest
so
unlike
her
stornham
listlessness
that
betty
heart
was
moved
her
face
looked
alive
and
little
waves
of
colour
rose
under
her
skin
several
times
she
laughed
the
natural
little
laugh
of
her
girlhood
which
it
had
seemed
almost
too
much
to
expect
to
hear
again
the
first
of
these
laughs
came
when
she
counted
her
tenth
american
a
tall
westerner
of
the
cartoon
type
sauntering
along
with
an
expression
of
speculative
enjoyment
on
his
odd
face
and
evidently
though
furtively
chewing
tobacco
i
absolutely
love
him
betty
she
cried
you
could
mistake
him
for
anything
no
answered
betty
feeling
that
she
loved
him
herself
not
if
you
found
him
embalmed
in
the
they
pleased
themselves
immensely
trying
to
guess
what
he
would
buy
and
take
home
to
his
wife
and
girls
in
his
western
town
though
western
towns
were
very
grand
and
amazing
in
these
days
betty
explained
and
knew
they
could
give
points
to
new
york
he
would
not
buy
the
things
he
would
have
bought
fifteen
years
ago
perhaps
in
fact
his
wife
and
daughters
had
come
with
him
to
london
and
stayed
at
the
metropole
or
the
savoy
and
were
at
this
moment
being
fitted
by
tailors
and
modistes
patronised
by
royalty
rosy
look
do
you
see
who
that
is
do
you
recognise
her
it
is
bellingham
she
was
little
mina
thalberg
she
married
captain
bellingham
he
was
quite
poor
but
very
well
born
a
nephew
of
lord
dunholm
he
could
not
have
married
a
poor
girl
but
they
have
been
so
happy
together
that
mina
is
growing
fat
and
spends
her
days
in
taking
reducing
treatments
she
says
she
would
care
in
the
least
but
dicky
fell
in
love
with
her
waist
and
shoulder
the
plump
pretty
young
woman
getting
out
of
her
victoria
before
a
fashionable
hairdresser
looked
radiant
enough
she
had
not
yet
lost
the
waist
and
shoulder
line
though
her
pink
frock
fitted
her
with
discreet
tightness
she
paused
a
moment
to
pat
and
fuss
prettily
over
the
two
blooming
curly
children
who
were
to
remain
under
the
care
of
the
nurse
who
sat
on
the
back
seat
holding
the
baby
on
her
lap
i
should
not
have
known
her
said
rosy
she
has
grown
pretty
she
was
a
pretty
it
happiness
and
the
english
climate
and
captain
dicky
they
adore
each
other
and
laugh
at
everything
like
a
pair
of
children
they
were
immensely
popular
in
new
york
last
winter
when
they
visited
the
effect
of
the
morning
upon
lady
anstruthers
was
what
betty
had
hoped
it
might
be
the
curious
drawing
near
of
the
two
nations
began
to
dawn
upon
her
as
a
truth
immured
in
the
country
not
sufficiently
interested
in
life
to
read
newspapers
she
had
heard
rumours
of
some
of
the
more
important
marriages
but
had
known
nothing
of
the
thousand
small
details
which
made
for
the
weaving
of
the
web
mrs
treat
hilyar
driving
in
a
leisurely
accustomed
fashion
down
bond
street
and
smiling
casually
at
her
compatriots
whose
sailing
was
as
much
part
of
the
natural
order
of
their
luxurious
lives
as
their
carriages
gave
a
definiteness
to
the
situation
mina
thalberg
pulling
down
the
embroidered
frocks
over
the
round
legs
of
her
children
seemed
to
narrow
the
width
of
the
atlantic
ocean
between
liverpool
and
the
docks
on
the
hudson
river
she
returned
to
the
hotel
with
an
appetite
for
lunch
and
a
new
expression
in
her
eyes
which
made
ughtred
stare
at
her
mother
he
said
you
look
different
you
look
well
it
is
only
your
new
dress
and
your
the
new
style
of
her
attire
had
certainly
done
much
and
the
maid
who
had
been
engaged
to
attend
her
was
a
woman
who
knew
her
duties
she
had
been
called
upon
in
her
time
to
make
the
most
of
hair
offering
much
less
assistance
to
her
skill
than
was
supplied
by
the
fine
fair
colourlessness
she
had
found
dragged
back
from
her
new
forehead
it
was
not
dragged
back
now
but
had
really
been
done
wonders
with
rosalie
had
smiled
a
little
when
she
had
looked
at
herself
in
the
glass
after
the
first
time
it
was
so
dressed
you
are
trying
to
make
me
look
as
i
did
when
mother
saw
me
last
betty
she
said
i
wonder
if
you
possibly
let
us
believe
we
can
laughed
betty
and
wait
and
it
seemed
wise
neither
to
make
nor
receive
visits
the
time
for
such
things
had
evidently
not
yet
come
even
the
mention
of
the
worthingtons
led
to
the
revelation
that
rosalie
shrank
from
immediate
contact
with
people
when
she
felt
stronger
when
she
became
more
accustomed
to
the
thought
she
might
feel
differently
but
just
now
to
be
luxuriously
one
with
the
enviable
part
of
london
to
look
on
to
drink
in
to
drive
here
and
there
doing
the
things
she
liked
to
do
ordering
what
was
required
at
stornham
was
like
the
creating
for
her
of
a
new
heaven
and
a
new
earth
when
one
night
betty
took
her
with
ughtred
to
the
theatre
it
was
to
see
a
play
written
by
an
american
played
by
american
actors
produced
by
an
american
manager
they
had
even
engaged
in
theatrical
enterprise
it
seemed
their
actors
played
before
london
audiences
london
actors
played
in
american
theatres
vibrating
almost
yearly
between
the
two
continents
and
reaping
rich
harvests
hearing
rumours
of
this
in
the
past
lady
anstruthers
had
scarcely
believed
it
entirely
true
now
the
practical
reality
was
brought
before
her
the
french
who
were

from
the
english
metropolis
by
a
mere
few
miles
of
channel
did
not
exchange
their
actors
year
after
year
in
increasing
numbers
making
a
mere
friendly
barter
of
each
other
territory
as
though
each
land
was
common
ground
and
not

by

of

travel
it
seems
so
wonderful
lady
anstruthers
argued
i
have
always
felt
as
if
they
hated
each
they
did
once
but
how
could
it
last
between
those
of
the
same
blood
of
the
same
tongue
if
we
were
really
aliens
we
might
be
a
menace
but
we
are

their
betty
leaned
forward
on
the
edge
of
the
box
looking
out
over
the
crowded
house
filled
with
almost
as
many
americans
as
english
faces
she
smiled
reflecting
we
were
children
put
out
to
nurse
and
breathe
new
air
in
the
country
and
now
we
are
coming
home
vigorous
and
she
studied
the
audience
for
some
minutes
and
as
her
glance
wandered
over
the
stalls
it
took
in
more
than
one
marked
variety
of
type
suddenly
it
fell
on
a
face
she
delightedly
recognised
it
was
that
of
the
nice
westerner
they
had
seen
enjoying
himself
in
bond
street
rosy
she
said
there
is
the
western
man
we
love
near
the
end
of
the
fourth
lady
anstruthers
looked
for
him
with
eagerness
oh
i
see
him
next
to
the
big
one
with
the
reddish
betty
turned
her
attention
to
the
man
in
question
whom
she
had
not
chanced
to
notice
she
uttered
an
exclamation
of
surprise
and
interest
the
big
man
with
the
red
hair
how
lovely
that
they
should
chance
to
sit
side
by
side
the
big
one
is
lord
mount
dunstan
the
necessity
of
seeing
his
solicitors
who
happened
to
be
townlinson
sheppard
had
brought
lord
mount
dunstan
to
town
after
a
day
devoted
to
business
affairs
he
had
been
attracted
by
the
idea
of
going
to
the
theatre
to
see
again
a
play
he
had
already
seen
in
new
york
it
would
interest
him
to
observe
its
exact
effect
upon
a
london
audience
while
he
had
been
in
new
york
he
had
gone
with
something
of
the
same
feeling
to
see
a
great
english
actor
play
to
a
crowded
house
the
great
actor
had
been
one
who
had
returned
to
the
country
for
a
third
or
fourth
time
and
in
the
enthusiasm
he
had
felt
in
the
atmosphere
about
him
mount
dunstan
had
seen
not
only
pleasure
and
appreciation
of
the
man
perfect
art
but
at
certain
tumultuous
outbursts
an
almost
emotional
welcome
the
americans
he
had
said
to
himself
were
creatures
of
warmer
blood
than
the
english
the
audience
on
that
occasion
had
been
in
mass
american
the
audience
he
made
one
of
now
was
made
up
of
both
nationalities
and
in
glancing
over
it
he
realised
how
large
was
the
number
of
americans
who
came
yearly
to
london
as
lady
anstruthers
had
done
he
found
himself
selecting
from
the
assemblage
the
types
which
were
manifestly
american
and
those
obviously
english
in
the
seat
next
to
himself
sat
a
man
of
a
type
he
felt
he
had
learned
by
heart
in
the
days
of
his
life
as
jem
salter
at
a
short
distance
fluttered
brilliantly
an
english
professional
beauty
with
her
male
and
female
court
about
her
in
the
stage
box
made
sumptuous
with
flowers
was
a
royal
party
as
this
party
had
entered
god
save
the
queen
had
been
played
and
in
rising
with
the
audience
during
the
entry
he
had
recalled
that
the
tune
was
identical
with
that
of
an
american
national
air
how
unconsciously
inseparable
in
spite
of
the
lightness
with
which
they
regarded
the
curious
tie
between
them
the
two
countries
were
the
people
upon
the
stage
were
acting
as
if
they
knew
their
public
their
bearing
suggesting
no
sense
of
any
barrier
beyond
the
footlights
it
was
the
unconsciousness
and
lightness
of
the
mutual
attitude
which
had
struck
him
of
late
punch
had
long
jested
about
fair
americans
who
in
their
first
introduction
to
its
pages
used
exotic
and
cryptic
language
beginning
every
sentence
either
with
i
guess
or
say
stranger
its
male
american
had
been
of
the
uncle
sam
order
and
had
invariably
worn
a
american
witticisms
had
represented
the
englishman
in
plaid
trousers
opening
his
remarks
with
chawley
deah
fellah
and
unfailingly
missing
the
point
of
any
joke
each
country
had
cherished
its
type
and
derided
it
in
time
this
had
modified
itself
and
the
joke
had
changed
in
kind
many
other
things
had
changed
but
the
lightness
of
treatment
still
remained
and
yet
their
blood
was
mingling
itself
with
that
of
england
noblest
and
oldest
of
name
their
wealth
was
making
solid
again
towers
and
halls
which
had
threatened
to
crumble
ancient
family
jewels
glittered
on
slender
young
american
necks
and
above
sometimes
somewhat
careless
young
american
brows
and
yet
so
far
one
was
casual
in
one
thought
of
it
all
still
on
his
own
part
he
was
obstinate
briton
enough
to
rebel
against
and
resent
it
they
were
intruders
he
resented
them
as
he
had
resented
in
his
boyhood
the
historical
fact
that
after
all
an
englishman
was
a
german
a
savage
who
five
hundred
years
after
the
birth
of
christ
had
swooped
upon
early
briton
from
his
engleland
and
jutland
and
ravaging
with
fire
and
sword
had
conquered
and
made
the
land
his
possession
ravishing
its
very
name
from
it
and
giving
it
his
own
these
people
did
not
come
with
fire
and
sword
but
with
cable
and
telephone
and
bribes
of
gold
and
fair
women
but
they
were
encroaching
like
the
sea
which
in
certain
parts
of
the
coast
gained
a
few
inches
or
so
each
year
he
shook
his
shoulders
impatiently
and
stiffened
feeling
illogically
antagonistic
towards
the
man
at
his
side
the
man
looked
because
he
was
smiling
and
he
was
smiling
because
he
saw
something
which
pleased
him
in
one
of
the
boxes
his
expression
of
unqualified
approval
naturally
directed
mount
dunstan
eye
to
the
point
in
question
where
it
remained
for
some
moments
this
was
because
he
found
it
resting
upon
miss
vanderpoel
who
sat
before
him
in
luminous
white
garments
and
with
a
brilliant
spark
of
ornament
in
the
dense
shadow
of
her
hair
his
sensation
at
the
unexpected
sight
of
her
would
if
it
had
expressed
itself
physically
have
taken
the
form
of
a
slight
start
the
luminous
quality
did
not
confine
itself
to
the
whiteness
of
her
garments
he
was
aware
of
feeling
that
she
looked
luminous
herself
her
eyes
her
cheek
the
smile
she
bent
upon
the
little
woman
who
was
her
companion
she
was
a
beautifully
living
thing
naturally
she
was
being
looked
at
by
others
than
himself
she
was
one
of
those
towards
whom
glasses
in
a
theatre
turn
themselves
inevitably
the
sweep
and
lift
of
her
black
hair
would
have
drawn
them
even
if
she
had
offered
no
other
charm
yes
he
thought
here
was
another
of
them
to
whom
was
she
bringing
her
good
looks
and
her
millions
there
were
men
enough
who
needed
money
even
if
they
must
accept
it
under
less
alluring
conditions
in
the
box
next
to
the
one
occupied
by
the
royal
party
was
a
man
who
was
known
to
be
waiting
for
the
advent
of
some
such
opportunity
his
was
a
case
of
dire
if
outwardly
stately
need
he
was
young
but
a
fool
and
not
noted
for
personal
charms
yet
he
had
in
one
sense
great
things
to
offer
there
were
of
course
many
chances
that
he
might
offer
them
to
her
if
this
happened
would
she
accept
them
there
was
really
no
objection
to
him
but
his
dulness
consequently
there
seemed
many
chances
that
she
might
there
was
something
akin
to
the
pomp
of
royalty
in
the
power
her
father
wealth
implied
she
could
scarcely
make
an
ordinary
marriage
it
would
naturally
be
a
sort
of
state
affair
there
were
few
men
who
had
enough
to
offer
in
exchange
for
vanderpoel
millions
and
of
the
few
none
had
special
attractions
the
one
in
the
box
next
to
the
royal
party
was
a
decent
enough
fellow
as
young
princesses
were
not
infrequently
called
upon
by
the
mere
exclusion
of
royal
blood
to
become
united
to
young
or
mature
princes
without
charm
so
american
young
persons
who
were
of
royal
possessions
must
find
themselves
limited
if
you
felt
free
to
pick
and
choose
from
among
young
men
in
the
guards
or
young
attaches
in
the
diplomatic
service
with
twopence
a
year
you
might
get
beauty
or
wit
or
temperament
or
all
three
by
good
luck
but
if
you
were
of
a
royal
house
of
new
york
or
chicago
you
would
probably
feel
you
must
draw
lines
and
choose
only
such
splendours
as
accorded
with
even
while
differing
from
your
own
any
possible
connection
of
himself
with
such
a
case
did
not
present
itself
to
him
if
it
had
done
so
he
would
have
counted
himself
haughtily
as
beyond
the
pale
it
was
for
other
men
to
do
things
of
the
sort
a
remote
antagonism
of
his
whole
being
warred
against
the
mere
idea
it
was
bigoted
prejudice
perhaps
but
it
was
a
strong
thing
a
lovely
shoulder
and
a
brilliant
head

and
slender

moment

he

something
rather
like
the
thing
he
had
seen
when
the
meridiana
moved
away
from
the
dock
and
the
exalted
miss
vanderpoel
leaning
upon
the
rail
had
held
out
her
arms
towards
the

brought
his

hearing
that

had
a

she
was
leaning
towards
him
her
hand
resting
on
his
shoulder
explaining
something
he
had
not
quite
grasped
in
the
action
of
the
play
the
absolute
adoration
in
the
boy
uplifted
eyes
was
an
interesting
thing
to
take
in
and
the
radiant
warmth
of
her
bright
look
was
as
unconscious
of
onlookers
as
it
had
been
when
he
had
seen
it

the
temperament
which
gave

found
himself

her
look
brought
back

things
occur
in
stornham
village
it
would
not
have
been
possible
for
miss
vanderpoel
to
remain
long
in
social
seclusion
in
london
and
before
many
days
had
passed
stornham
village
was
enlivened
by
the
knowledge
that
her
ladyship
and
her
sister
had
returned
to
the
court
it
was
also
evident
that
their
visit
to
london
had
not
been
made
to
no
purpose
the
stagnation
of
the
waters
of
village
life
threatened
to
become
a
whirlpool
a
respectable
person
who
was
to
be
her
ladyship
maid
had
come
with
them
and
her
ladyship
had
not
been
served
by
a
personal
attendant
for
years
her
ladyship
had
also
appeared
at
the
in
new
garments
and
with
her
hair
done
as
other
ladies
wore
theirs
she
looked
like
a
different
woman
and
actually
had
a
bit
of
colour
and
was
beginning
to
lose
her
frightened
way
now
it
dawned
upon
even
the
dullest
and
least
active
mind
that
something
had
begun
to
stir
it
had
been
felt
vaguely
when
the
new
young
lady
from
meriker
had
walked
through
the
village
street
and
had
drawn
people
to
doors
and
windows
by
her
mere
passing
after
the
return
from
london
the
signs
of
activity
were
such
as
made
the
villagers
catch
their
breaths
in
uttering
uncertain
exclamations
and
caused
the
feminine
element
to
catch
up
offspring
or
dragging
it
by
its
hand
run
into
neighbours
cottages
and
stand
talking
the
incredible
thing
over
in
lowered
and
rather
breathless
voices
yet
the
incredible
thing
in
question
was
had
it
been
seen
from
the
standpoint
of
more
prosperous
villagers
anything
but
extraordinary
in
entirely
rural
places
the
castle
the
hall
or
the
manor
the
great
house
in
short

retains
somewhat
of
the
old
feudal
power
to
bestow

stornham
village
had
scarcely
a
remote
memory
of
any
period
of
such
prosperity
it
had
not
existed
even
in
the
older
sir
nigel
time
and
certainly
the
present
sir
nigel
reign
had
been
marked
only
by
neglect
indifference
and
a
falling
into
disorder
and
decay
farms
were
poorly
worked
labourers
were
unemployed
there
was
no

from

no

no

no

no

leaked

were

the

falling
to
pieces

had
nothing
to
give

had

standing
before
him
with
the
result
that
he
had
been
struck
all
of

and
then
he
had
given
a
detailed
account
of
their
walk
round
the
place
and
of
the
way
in
which
she
had
looked
at
things
and
asked
questions

as

by

he
dwelt
upon

lighted
up

so
conversed
that
a

when
it
was
his
business
to
be
an
unhearing
unseeing
piece
of
mechanism
such
simple
records
of
servitors
impressions
were
quite
enough
for
stornham
village
and
produced
in
it
a
sense
of
being
roused
a
little
from
sleep
to
listen
to
distant
and
uncomprehended
but
not
unagreeable
sounds
one
morning
buttle
the
carpenter
looked
up
as
kedgers
had
done
and
saw
standing
on
the
threshold
of
his
shop
the
tall
young
woman
who
was
a
sensation
and
an
event
in
herself
you
are
the
master
of
this
shop
she
asked
buttle
came
forward
touching
his
brow
in
hasty
salute
yes
my
lady
he
answered
joseph
buttle
your
i
am
miss
vanderpoel
dismissing
the
suddenly
bestowed
title
with
easy
directness
are
you
busy
i
want
to
talk
to
no
one
had
any
reason
to
be
busy
at
any
time
in
stornham
village
no
such
luck
but
buttle
did
not
smile
as
he
replied
that
he
was
at
liberty
and
placed
himself
at
his
visitor
disposal
the
tall
young
lady
came
into
the
little
shop
and
took
the
chair
respectfully
offered
to
her
buttle
saw
her
eyes
sweep
the
place
as
if
taking
in
its
resources
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
some
work
which
must
be
done
at
the
court
she
explained
at
once
i
want
to
know
how
much
can
be
done
by
workmen
of
the
village
how
many
men
have
you
how
many
men
had
he
buttle
wavered
between
gratification
at
its
being
supposed
that
he
had
men
under
him
and
grumpy
depression
because
the
illusion
must
be
dispelled
there
me
and
sim
soames
miss
he
answered
no
more
an
no
where
can
you
get
more
asked
miss
vanderpoel
it
could
not
be
denied
that
buttle
received
a
mental
shock
which
verged
in
its
suddenness
on
being
almost
a
physical
one
the
promptness
and
decision
of
such
a
query
swept
him
off
his
feet
that
sim
soames
and
himself
should
be
an
insufficient
force
to
combat
with
such
repairs
as
the
court
could
afford
was
an
idea
presenting
an
aspect
of
novelty
but
that
methods
as
coolly
radical
as
those
this
questioning
implied
should
be
resorted
to
was
staggering
me
and
sim
has
always
done
what
work
was
done
he
stammered
it
has
been
miss
vanderpoel
neither
assented
to
nor
dissented
from
this
last
palpable
truth
she
regarded
buttle
with
searching
eyes
she
was
wondering
if
any
practical
ability
concealed
itself
behind
his
dullness
if
she
gave
him
work
could
he
do
it
if
she
gave
the
whole
village
work
was
it
too
far
gone
in
its
unspurred
stodginess
to
be
roused
to
carrying
it
out
there
is
a
great
deal
to
be
done
now
she
said
all
that
can
be
done
in
the
village
should
be
done
here
it
seems
to
me
that
the
villagers
want
work
new
work
do
they
work
new
work
the
spark
of
life
in
her
steady
eyes
actually
lighted
a
spark
in
the
being
of
joe
buttle
young
ladies
in
villages
gentry
usually
visited
the
cottagers
a
bit
if
they
were
young
women
left
good
books
and
broth
or
jelly
pottered
about
and
were
seen
at
church
and
playing
croquet
and
finally
married
and
removed
to
other
places
or
gradually
faded
year
by
year
into
respectable
spinsterhood
and
this
one
comes
in
and
in
two
or
three
minutes
shows
that
she
knows
things
about
the
place
and
understands
a
man
might
then
take
it
for
granted
that
she
would
understand
the
thing
he
daringly
gathered
courage
to
say
they
want
any
work
miss
that
they
are
sure
of
decent
pay
for
sure
of
she
did
understand
and
she
did
not
treat
his
implication
as
an
impertinence
she
knew
it
was
not
intended
as
one
and
indeed
she
saw
in
it
a
sort
of
earnest
of
a
possible
practical
quality
in
buttle
such
work
as
the
court
had
demanded
had
remained
unpaid
for
with
quiet
persistence
until
even
bills
had
begun
to
lag
and
fall
off
she
could
see
exactly
how
it
had
been
done
and
comprehended
quite
clearly
a
lack
of
enthusiasm
in
the
presence
of
orders
from
the
great
house
all
work
will
be
paid
for
she
said
each
week
the
workmen
will
receive
their
wages
they
may
be
sure
i
will
be
thank
you
miss
said
buttle
and
he
half
unconsciously
touched
his
forehead
again
in
a
place
like
this
the
young
lady
went
on
in
her
mellow
voice
and
with
a
reflective
thoughtfulness
in
her
handsome
eyes
on
an
estate
like
stornham
no
work
that
can
be
done
by
the
villagers
should
be
done
by
anyone
else
the
people
of
the
land
should
be
trained
to
do
such
work
as
the
manor
house
or
cottages
or
farms
require
to
have
how
did
she
think
that
out
was
buttle
reflection
in
places
such
as
stornham
through
generation
after
generation
the
thing
she
had
just
said
was
accepted
as
law
clung
to
as
a
possession
any
divergence
from
it
being
a
grievance
sullenly
and
bitterly
grumbled
over
and
in
places
enough
there
was
divergence
in
these
days
the
gentry
sending
to
london
for
things
and
having
up
workmen
to
do
their
jobs
for
them
the
law
had
been
so
long
a
law
that
no
village
could
see
justice
in
outsiders
being
sent
for
even
to
do
work
they
could
not
do
well
themselves
it
showed
what
she
was
this
handsome
young
woman
even
though
she
did
come
from
america
that
she
should
know
what
was
right
she
took
a
out
and
opened
it
on
the
rough
table
before
her
i
have
made
some
notes
here
she
said
and
a
sketch
or
two
we
must
talk
them
over
if
she
had
given
joe
buttle
cause
for
surprise
at
the
outset
she
gave
him
further
cause
during
the
next
the
work
that
was
to
be
done
was
such
as
made
him
open
his
eyes
and
draw
in
his
breath
if
he
was
to
be
allowed
to
do
it
if
he
could
do
it
if
it
was
to
be
paid
for
it
struck
him
that
he
would
be
a
man
set
up
for
life
if
her
ladyship
had
come
and
ordered
it
to
be
done
he
would
have
thought
the
poor
thing
had
gone
mad
but
this
one
had
it
all
jotted
down
in
a
clear
hand
without
the
least
feminine
confusion
of
detail
and
with
here
and
there
a
little
sketch
such
as
a
carpenter
if
he
could
draw
which
buttle
could
not
might
have
made
there
not
workmen
enough
in
the
village
to
do
it
in
a
year
miss
he
said
at
last
with
a
gasp
of
disappointment
she
thought
it
over
a
minute
her
pencil
poised
in
her
hand
and
her
eyes
on
his
face
can
you
she
said
undertake
to
get
men
from
other
villages
and
superintend
what
they
do
if
you
can
do
that
the
work
is
still
passing
through
your
hands
and
stornham
will
reap
the
benefit
of
it
your
workmen
will
lodge
at
the
cottages
and
spend
part
of
their
wages
at
the
shops
and
you
who
are
a
stornham
workman
will
earn
the
money
to
be
made
out
of
a
rather
large
joe
buttle
became
quite
hot
if
you
have
brought
up
a
family
for
years
on
the
proceeds
of
such
jobs
as
driving
a
nail
in
here
or
there
tinkering
a
hole
in
a
cottage
roof
knocking
up
a
shelf
in
the
vicarage
kitchen
and
mending
a
panel
of
fence
to
be
suddenly
confronted
with
a
proposal
to
engage
workmen
and
undertake
contracts
is
shortening
to
the
breath
and
heating
to
the
blood
miss
he
said
we
never
done
big
jobs
sim
soames
an
me
we
not
up
to
it
but
it
be
a
fortune
to
she
was
looking
down
at
one
of
her
papers
and
making
pencil
marks
on
it
you
did
some
work
last
year
on
a
little
house
at
tidhurst
did
you
she
said
to
think
of
her
knowing
that
yes
the
unaccountable
good
luck
had
actually
come
to
him
that
two
tidhurst
carpenters
falling
ill
of
the
same
typhoid
at
the
same
time
through
living
side
by
side
in
the
same
order
of
unsanitary
cottage
he
and
sim
had
been
given
their
work
to
finish
and
had
done
their
best
yes
miss
he
answered
i
heard
that
when
i
was
inquiring
about
you
i
drove
over
to
tidhurst
to
see
the
work
and
it
was
very
sound
and
well
done
if
you
did
that
i
can
at
least
trust
you
to
do
something
at
the
court
which
will
prove
to
me
what
you
are
equal
to
i
want
a
stornham
man
to
undertake
no
tidhurst
man
said
joe
buttle
with
sudden
courage
nor
yet
no
barnhurst
nor
yet
no
yangford
nor
wratcham
shall
do
it
if
i
can
look
it
in
the
face
it
stornham
work
and
stornham
had
ought
to
have
it
it
gives
me
a
to
hear
of
the
tall
young
lady
laughed
beautifully
and
got
up
come
to
the
court
morning
at
ten
and
we
will
look
it
over
together
she
said
and
she
went
away
in
the
taproom
of
the
clock
when
joe
buttle
dropped
in
for
his
pot
of
beer
he
found
fox
the
saddler
and
tread
the
blacksmith
and
each
of
them
fell
upon
the
others
with
something
of
the
same
story
to
tell
the
new
young
lady
from
the
court
had
been
to
see
them
too
and
had
brought
to
each
her
definite
little
harness
was
to
be
repaired
and
furbished
up
the
big
carriage
and
the
old
phaeton
were
to
be
put
in
order
and
master
ughtred
cart
was
to
be
given
new
paint
and
springs
this
is
what
she
said
fox
story
ran
and
she
said
it
so
straightforward
and
that
the
conceitedest
man
that
lived
could
be
upset
by
it
want
to
see
what
you
can
do
she
says
am
new
to
the
place
and
i
must
find
out
what
everyone
can
do
then
i
shall
know
what
to
do
myself
the
way
she
sets
them
eyes
on
a
man
is
a
sight
it
the
sense
in
them
and
the
human
nature
that
takes
yes
it
the
sense
said
tread
and
her
looking
at
you
as
if
she
expected
you
to
have
sense
yourself
and
understand
that
she
doing
fair
business
it
like
her
asking
questions
and
finding
out
what
stornham
men
can
do
she
having
the
old
things
done
up
so
that
she
can
find
out
and
so
that
she
can
prove
that
the
court
work
is
going
to
be
paid
for
that
my
but
what
does
it
all
mean
said
joe
buttle
setting
his
pot
of
beer
down
on
the
taproom
table
round
which
they
sat
in
conclave
the
money
coming
from
there
money
tread
was
the
advanced
thinker
of
the
village
he
had
come
through
reverses
from
a
bigger
place
he
read
the
newspapers
it
come
from
where
it
got
a
way
of
coming
he
gave
forth
portentously
it
come
from
america
how
they
manage
to
get
hold
of
so
much
of
it
there
is
past
me
but
they
got
it
dang
and
they
ready
to
spend
it
for
what
they
want
though
they
a
sharp
lot
twelve
years
ago
there
was
a
good
bit
of
talk
about
her
father
being
one
of
them
with
the
fullest
pockets
she
came
here
with
plenty
but
sir
nigel
got
hold
of
it
for
his
games
and
they
the
games
that
cost
money
her
ladyship
was
born
with
a
backbone
poor
thing
but
this
new
one
was
and
her
ladyship
father
is
her
father
and
you
mark
my
words
there
money
coming
into
stornham
though
not
going
to
be
played
the
fool
with
lord
yes
this
new
one
has
a
backbone
and
good
strong
wrists
and
a
good
strong
head
though
i
must
say
with
a
little
masculine
chuckle
of
admission
it
a
bit
unnatural
with
them
eyelashes
and
them
eyes
looking
at
you
between
like
blue
water
between
rushes
in
the
before
the
next
hours
had
passed
a
still
more
event
had
taken
place
long
outstanding
bills
had
been
paid
and
in
as
manner
as
if
they
had
not
been
sent
in
and
ignored
in
some
cases
for
years
the
settlement
of
joe
buttle
account
sent
him
to
bed
at
the
day
end
almost
to
become
suddenly
the
possessor
of
pounds
fifteen
and
tenpence
of
which
all
hope
had
been
lost
three
years
ago
was
almost
too
much
for
any
man
six
pounds
eight
pounds
ten
pounds
came
into
places
as
if
sovereigns
had
been
sixpences
and
shillings
farthings
more
than
one
cottage
woman
at
the
sight
of
the
hoarded
wealth
in
her
staring
goodman
hand
gulped
and
began
to
cry
if
they
had
had
it
before
and
in
driblets
it
would
have
been
spent
long
since
now
in
a
lump
it
meant
shoes
and
petticoats
and
tea
and
sugar
in
temporary
abundance
and
the
sense
of
this
abundance
was
felt
to
be
entirely
due
to
american
magic
america
was
in
fact
greatly
lauded
and
discussed
the
case
of
gaarge
lumsden
being
much
quoted
chapter
xxi
kedgers
the
work
at
stornham
court
went
on
steadily
though
with
no
greater
rapidity
than
is
usually
achieved
by
rural
labourers
there
was
however
without
doubt
a
certain
stimulus
in
the
occasional
appearance
of
miss
vanderpoel
who
almost
daily
sauntered
round
the
place
to
look
on
and
exchange
a
few
words
with
the
workmen
when
they
saw
her
coming
the
men
hastily
standing
up
to
touch
their
foreheads
were
conscious
of
a
slight
acceleration
of
being
which
was
not
quite
the
ordinary
quickening
produced
by
the
presence
of
employers
it
was
in
fact
a
sensation
rather
pleasing
than
anxious
her
interest
in
the
work
was
upon
the
whole
one
which
they
found
themselves
beginning
to
share
the
unusualness
of
the
situation
a
young
woman
who
evidently
stood
for
many
things
and
powers
desirable
employing
labourers
and
seeming
to
know
what
she
intended
them
to
do
was
a
thing
not
easy
to
get
over
or
be
come
accustomed
to
but
there
she
was
as
easy
and
well
mannered
as
you
please
and
with
gentlefolks
ways
though
as
an
american
such
finish
could
scarcely
be
expected
from
her
she
knew
each
man
name
it
was
revealed
gradually
and
what
was
more
knew
what
he
stood
for
in
the
village
what
cottage
he
lived
in
how
many
children
he
had
and
something
about
his
wife
she
remembered
things
and
made
inquiries
which
showed
knowledge
besides
this
she
represented
though
perhaps
they
were
scarcely
yet
fully
awake
to
the
fact
the
promise
their
discouraged
dulness
had
long
lost
sight
of
it
actually
became
apparent
that
her
ladyship
who
walked
with
her
was
altering
day
by
day
was
it
true
that
the
bit
of
colour
they
had
heard
spoken
of
when
she
returned
from
town
was
deepening
and
fixing
itself
on
her
cheek
it
sometimes
looked
like
it
was
she
a
bit
less
stiff
and
and
frightened
in
her
way
buttle
mentioned
to
his
friends
at
the
clock
that
he
was
sure
of
it
she
had
begun
to
look
a
man
in
the
face
when
she
talked
and
more
than
once
he
had
heard
her
laugh
at
things
her
sister
said
to
one
man
more
than
to
any
other
had
come
an
almost
unspeakable
piece
of
luck
through
the
new
arrival
a
thing
which
to
himself
at
least
was
as
the
opening
of
the
heavens
this
man
was
the
discouraged
kedgers
miss
vanderpoel
coming
with
her
ladyship
to
talk
to
him
found
that
the
man
was
a
person
of
more
experience
than
might
have
been
imagined
in
his
youth
he
had
been
an
under
gardener
at
a
great
place
and
being
fond
of
his
work
had
learned
more
than
under
gardeners
often
learn
he
had
been
one
of
a
small
army
of
workers
under
the
orders
of
an
imposing
head
gardener
whose
knowledge
was
a
science
he
had
seen
and
taken
part
in
what
was
done
in
orchid
houses
orangeries
vineries
peach
houses
conservatories
full
of
wondrous
tropical
plants
but
it
was
not
easy
for
a
man
like
himself
uneducated
and
lacking
confidence
of
character
to
advance
as
a
bolder
young
man
might
have
done
the
head
gardener
had
inspired
him
with
awe
he
had
watched
him
reverently
accumulating
knowledge
but
being
given
as
an
underling
no
opportunity
to
do
more
than
obey
orders
he
had
spent
his
life
in
obeying
and
congratulated
himself
that
obedience
secured
him
his
weekly
wage
he
was
a
great
man
timson
he
was
he
said
in
talking
to
miss
vanderpoel
ay
he
was
that
knew
everything
that
could
happen
to
a
flower
or
a
or
a
vegetable
knew
it
all
had
a
of
books
an
read
night
an
day
head
gardener
cottage
was
good
enough
for
gentry
the
old
markis
used
to
walk
round
the
hothouses
an
gardens
talking
to
him
by
the
hour
if
you
did
what
he
told
you
exactly
like
he
told
it
to
you
then
you
were
all
right
but
if
you
did
well
you
was
off
the
place
before
you
time
to
look
round
worked
under
him
from
twenty
to
forty
then
he
died
an
the
new
one
that
came
in
had
new
ways
he
made
a
clean
sweep
of
most
of
us
the
men
said
he
was
jealous
of
that
was
bad
for
you
if
you
had
a
wife
and
children
miss
vanderpoel
said
eight
of
us
to
feed
kedgers
answered
a
man
with
that
on
him
wait
miss
i
had
to
take
the
first
place
i
could
get
it
was
a
good
one
poor
parsonage
with
a
big
family
an
not
room
on
the
place
for
the
vegetables
they
wanted
cabbages
an
potatoes
an
beans
an
broccoli
no
time
nor
ground
for
flowers
used
to
seem
as
if
flowers
got
to
be
a
kind
of
kedgers
gave
vent
to
a
deprecatory
half
laugh
me
i
was
fond
of
flowers
i
would
have
asked
no
better
than
to
live
among
timson
gave
me
a
book
or
two
when
his
lordship
sent
him
a
lot
of
new
ones
i
bought
a
few
myself
though
i
suppose
i
afford
from
the
poor
parsonage
he
had
gone
to
a
market
gardener
and
had
evidently
liked
the
work
better
hard
and
unceasing
as
it
had
been
because
he
had
been
among
flowers
again
sudden
changes
from
forcing
houses
to
chill
outside
dampness
had
resulted
in
rheumatism
after
that
things
had
gone
badly
he
began
to
be
regarded
as
past
his
prime
of
strength
lower
wages
and
labour
still
as
hard
as
ever
though
it
professed
to
be
lighter
and
therefore
cheaper
at
last
the
big
neglected
gardens
of
stornham
what
i
seeing
miss
all
the
time
is
what
could
be
done
with
wonderful
it
be
they
might
be
the
show
of
the
we
had
timson
miss
vanderpoel
standing
in
the
sunshine
on
the
broad
pathway
was
conscious
that
he
was
remotely
moving
his
flowers
his
flowers
they
had
been
the
centre
of
his
rudimentary
rural
being
each
man
or
woman
cared
for
some
one
thing
and
the
unfed
longing
for
it
left
the
life
of
the
creature
a
thwarted
passion
kedgers
yearning
to
stir
the
earth
about
the
roots
of
blooming
things
and
doomed
to
broccoli
and
cabbage
had
spent
his
years
unfed
no
thing
is
a
small
thing
kedgers
with
the
earth
under
his
broad
finger
nails
and
his
half
apologetic
laugh
being
the
centre
of
his
own
world
was
as
large
as
mount
dunstan
who
stood
thwarted
in
the
centre
of
his
god
knows
what
mystery
of
be
born
one
of
those
having
power
one
might
perhaps
set
in
order
a
world
like
kedgers
in
the
course
of
twenty
years
work
under
timson
she
said
you
must
have
learned
a
great
deal
from
a
good
bit
good
bit
admitted
kedgers
if
i
had
ha
cared
for
the
work
i
might
ha
gone
on
doing
it
with
my
eyes
shut
but
i
did
timson
heart
was
set
on
it
as
well
as
his
head
an
mine
got
to
be
but
i
was
even
second
or
third
under
him
i
was
only
one
of
a
lot
he
would
have
thought
me
fine
an
impident
if
i
told
him
got
to
know
a
good
deal
of
what
he
knew
and
had
some
bits
of
ideas
of
my
if
you
had
men
enough
under
you
and
could
order
all
you
want
miss
vanderpoel
said
tentatively
you
know
what
the
place
should
be
no
that
i
do
miss
answered
kedgers
turning
red
with
feeling
why
if
the
soil
was
well
treated
anything
would
grow
here
there
situations
for
everything
there
shade
for
things
that
wants
it
and
south
aspects
for
things
that
wo
grow
without
the
warmth
of
well
gone
about
many
a
day
when
i
was
low
down
in
my
mind
and
worked
myself
up
to
being
cheerful
by
just
planning
where
i
could
put
things
and
what
they
look
like
liliums
now
i
could
grow
them
in
masses
from
june
to
he
was
becoming
excited
like
a
war
horse
scenting
battle
from
afar
and
forgot
himself
the
lilium
giganteum
i
do
know
whether
you
ever
seen
one
miss
but
if
you
did
it
almost
take
your
breath
away
a
lilium
that
grows
twelve
feet
high
and
more
and
has
a
flower
like
a
great
trumpet
and
the
scent
pouring
out
of
it
so
that
it
floats
for
yards
there
a
place
where
i
could
grow
them
so
that
you
come
on
them
sudden
and
you
think
they
could
be
grow
them
kedgers
begin
to
grow
them
said
miss
vanderpoel
i
have
never
seen
them
i
must
see
kedgers
low
deprecatory
chuckle
made
itself
heard
again
perhaps
i
going
too
fast
he
said
it
would
take
a
good
bit
of
expense
to
do
it
miss
a
good
then
miss
vanderpoel
made
and
she
made
it
in
the
simplest
manner
too
the
startling
remark
which
three
hours
later
all
stornham
village
had
heard
of
the
most
astounding
part
of
the
remark
was
that
it
was
uttered
as
if
there
was
nothing
in
it
which
was
not
the
absolutely
natural
outcome
of
the
circumstances
of
the
case
expense
which
is
proper
and
necessary
need
not
be
considered
she
said
regular
accounts
will
be
kept
and
supervised
but
you
can
have
all
that
is
then
it
appeared
that
kedgers
almost
became
pale
being
a
foreigner
perhaps
she
did
not
know
how
much
she
was
implying
when
she
said
such
a
thing
to
a
man
who
had
never
held
a
place
like
timson
miss
he
hesitated
even
shamefacedly
because
to
suggest
to
such
a
calm
young
lady
that
she
might
be
ignorant
seemed
perilously
near
impertinence
miss
did
you
mean
you
wanted
only
the
lilium
giganteum
or
or
other
things
as
i
should
like
to
see
she
answered
him
all
that
you
see
i
should
like
to
hear
more
of
it
all
when
we
have
time
to
talk
it
over
i
understand
we
should
need
time
to
discuss
the
quiet
way
she
went
on
seeming
to
believe
in
him
almost
as
if
he
was
timson
the
old
feeling
born
and
fostered
by
the
great
head
gardener
rule
reasserted
itself
it
means
more
to
work
and
someone
over
them
miss
he
said
if
if
you
had
a
man
like
timson
you
have
not
forgotten
what
you
learned
with
men
enough
under
you
it
can
be
put
into
you
mean
you
trust
me
miss
same
as
if
i
was
timson
yes
if
you
ever
feel
the
need
of
a
man
like
timson
no
doubt
we
can
find
one
but
you
will
not
you
love
the
work
too
then
still
standing
in
the
sunshine
on
the
path
she
continued
to
talk
to
him
it
revealed
itself
that
she
understood
a
good
deal
as
he
was
to
assume
heavier
responsibilities
he
was
to
receive
higher
wages
it
was
his
experience
which
was
to
be
considered
not
his
years
this
was
a
new
point
of
view
the
mere
propeller
of
and
digger
of
the
soil
particularly
after
having
been
attacked
by
rheumatism
depreciates
in
value
after
youth
is
past
kedgers
knew
that
a
timson
with
a
regiment
of
under
gardeners
and
daily
increasing
knowledge
of
his
profession
could
continue
to
direct
though
years
rolled
by
but
to
such
fortune
he
had
not
dared
to
aspire
one
of
the
lodges
might
be
put
in
order
for
him
to
live
in
he
might
have
the
hothouses
to
put
in
order
too
he
might
have
implements
plants
shrubs
even
some
of
the
newer
books
to
consult
kedgers
brain
reeled
you
think
i
am
to
be
trusted
miss
he
said
more
than
once
you
think
it
would
be
all
right
i
was
even
second
or
third
under
timson
but
if
i
say
it
as
should
i
never
lost
a
chance
of
learning
things
i
was
just
mad
about
it
only
liliums
lord
i
know
all
as
if
they
were
my
own
children
born
an
bred
shrubs
coniferas
herbaceous
borders
that
bloom
in
succession
my
word
what
you
can
do
with
just
delphiniums
an
campanula
an
acquilegia
an
poppies
everyday
things
like
them
that
grow
in
any
cottage
garden
an
bulbs
an
annuals
roses
miss
why
timson
had
them
in
thickets
carpets
an
clambering
over
trees
and
tumbling
over
walls
in
sheets
torrents
just
know
their
ways
an
what
they
want
an
they
grow
in
a
riot
but
they
want
feeding
feeding
a
rose
is
a
gross
feeder
feed
a
glory
deejon
and
watch
over
him
an
he
cover
a
housetop
an
give
you
two
i
have
never
lived
in
an
english
garden
i
should
like
to
see
this
one
at
its
leaving
her
with
salutes
of
abject
gratitude
kedgers
moved
away
bewildered
what
man
could
believe
it
true
at
three
or
four
distance
he
stopped
and
turning
came
back
to
touch
his
cap
again
you
understand
miss
he
said
i
was
even
second
or
third
under
timson
i
not
deceiving
you
am
i
miss
you
are
to
be
trusted
said
miss
vanderpoel
first
because
you
love
the
things
and
next
because
of
chapter
xxii
one
of
vanderpoel
letters
germen
the
secretary
of
the
great
vanderpoel
in
arranging
the
neat
stacks
of
letters
preparatory
to
his
chief
entrance
to
his
private
room
each
morning
knowing
where
each
should
be
placed
understood
that
such
as
were
addressed
in
miss
vanderpoel
hand
would
be
read
before
anything
else
this
had
been
the
case
even
when
she
had
just
been
placed
in
a
french
school
a
tall
slim
little
girl
with
immense
demanding
eyes
and
a
thick
black
plait
of
hair
swinging
between
her
straight
rather
thin
shoulders
between
other
financial
potentates
and
their
little
girls
germen
knew
that
the
oddly
confidential
relation
which
existed
between
these
two
was
unusual
her
schoolgirl
letters
it
had
been
understood
should
be
given
the
first
place
on
the
stacks
of
envelopes
each
incoming
ocean
steamer
brought
in
its
mail
bags
since
the
beginning
of
her
visit
to
her
sister
lady
anstruthers
the
exact
dates
of
mail
steamers
seemed
to
be
of
increased
importance
miss
vanderpoel
evidently
found
much
to
write
about
each
steamer
brought
a
envelope
to
be
placed
in
a
prominent
position
on
a
hot
morning
in
the
early
summer
germen
found
two
or
three
two
of
them
of
larger
size
and
seeming
to
contain
business
papers
these
he
placed
where
they
would
be
seen
at
once
vanderpoel
was
a
little
later
than
usual
in
his
arrival
at
this
season
he
came
from
his
place
in
the
country
and
before
leaving
it
this
morning
he
had
been
talking
to
his
wife
whom
he
found
rather
disturbed
by
a
chance
encounter
with
a
young
woman
who
had
returned
to
visit
her
mother
after
a
year
spent
in
england
with
her
english
husband
this
young
woman
now
lady
bowen
once
milly
jones
had
been
one
of
the
amusing
marvels
of
new
york
a
girl
neither
rich
nor
so
endowed
by
nature
as
to
be
able
to
press
upon
the
world
any
special
claim
to
consideration
as
a
beauty
her
enterprise
and
the
daring
of
her
tactics
had
been
the
delight
of
many
a
satiric
onlooker
in
her
schooldays
she
had
ingenuously
mapped
out
her
future
career
other
american
girls
married
men
with
titles
and
she
intended
to
do
the
same
thing
the
other
little
girls
laughed
but
they
liked
to
hear
her
talk
all
information
regarding
such
unions
as
was
to
be
found
in
the
newspapers
and
magazines
she
collected
and
studiously
read
sometimes
aloud
to
her
companions
social
paragraphs
about
royalties
dukes
and
duchesses
lords
and
ladies
court
balls
and
glittering
functions
she
devoured
and
learned
by
heart
an
abominably
vulgar
little
person
she
was
an
interestingly
pertinacious
creature
and
wrought
night
and
day
at
acquiring
an
air
of
fashionable
elegance
at
first
naturally
laying
it
on
in
such
manner
as
suggested
that
it
should
be
scraped
off
with
a
knife
but
with
experience
gaining
a
certain
specious
knowledge
of
forms
how
the
child
at
school
had
assimilated
her
uncanny
young
worldliness
it
would
have
been
less
difficult
to
decide
if
possible
sources
had
been
less
numerous
the
air
was
full
of
it
the
literature
of
the
day
the
chatter
of
afternoon
teas
the
gossip
of
the
hour
before
she
was
fifteen
she
saw
the
indiscretion
of
her
childish
frankness
and
realised
that
it
might
easily
be
detrimental
to
her
ambitions
she
said
no
more
of
her
plans
for
her
future
and
even
took
the
astute
tone
of
carelessly
treating
as
a
joke
her
vulgar
little
past
but
no
titled
foreigner
appeared
upon
the
horizon
without
setting
her
small
but
brain
at
work
her
lack
of
wealth
and
assured
position
made
her
situation
rather
hopeless
she
was
not
of
the
class
of
lucky
young
women
whose
parents
gorgeous
establishments
offered
attractions
to
wandering
persons
of
rank
she
and
her
mother
lived
in
a
flat
and
gave
rather
pathetic
afternoon
teas
in
return
for
such
more
brilliant
hospitalities
as
careful
and
pertinacious
calling
and
recalling
obliged
their
acquaintances
to
feel
they
could
not
decently
be
left
wholly
out
of
milly
and
her
anxious
mother
had
worked
hard
they
lost
no
opportunity
of
writing
a
note
or
sending
a
christmas
card
or
an
economical
funeral
wreath
by
daily
toil
and
the
amicable
ignoring
of
casualness
of
manner
or
slights
they
managed
to
cling
to
the
edge
of
the
precipice
of
social
oblivion
into
whose
depths
a
lesser
degree
of
assiduity
or
a
greater
sensitiveness
would
have
plunged
them
once
early
in
milly
career
when
her
chatter
and
her
superficial
brightness
were
a
novelty
it
had
seemed
for
a
short
time
that
luck
might
be
glancing
towards
her
a
young
man
of
foreign
title
and
of
bohemian
tastes
met
her
at
a
studio
dance
and
misled
by
the
smartness
of
her
dress
and
her
always
carefully
carried
air
of
careless
prosperity
began
to
pay
a
delusive
court
to
her
for
a
few
weeks
all
her
freshest
frocks
were
worn
assiduously
and
credit
was
strained
to
buy
new
ones
the
flat
was
adorned
with
fresh
flowers
and
several
new
yellow
and
pale
blue
cushions
appeared
at
the
little
teas
which
began
to
assume
a
more
festive
air
desirable
people
who
went
ordinarily
to
the
teas
at
long
intervals
and
through
reluctant
weakness
or
sometimes
rebellious
amiability
were
drummed
up
and
brought
firmly
to
the
fore
milly
herself
began
to
look
pink
and
fluffy
through
mere
hopeful
good
spirits
her
thin
little
laugh
was
heard
incessantly
and
people
amusedly
if
they
were
derisively
if
they
were
spiteful
wondered
if
it
really
would
come
to
something
but
it
did
not
the
young
foreigner
suddenly
left
new
york
making
his
adieus
with
entire
lightness
there
was
the
end
of
it
he
had
heard
something
about
lack
of
income
and
uncertainty
of
credit
which
had
suggested
to
him
that
discretion
was
the
better
part
of
valour
he
married
later
a
young
lady
in
the
west
whose
father
was
a
solid
person
less
astute
young
women
under
the
circumstances
would
have
allowed
themselves
a
week
or
so
of
headache
or
influenza
but
milly
did
not
she
made
calls
in
the
new
frocks
and
with
such
persistent
spirit
that
she
fished
forth
from
the
depths
of
indifferent
hospitality
two
or
three
excellent
invitations
she
wore
her
freshest
pink
frock
and
an
amazingly
clever
little
parisian
diamond
crescent
in
her
hair
at
the
huge
monson
ball
at
delmonico
and
it
was
recorded
that
it
was
on
that
glittering
occasion
that
her
uncle
james
was
first
brought
upon
the
scene
he
was
only
mentioned
lightly
at
first
it
was
to
milly
credit
that
he
was
not
made
too
much
of
he
was
casually
touched
upon
as
a
very
rich
uncle
who
lived
in
dakota
and
had
actually
lived
there
since
his
youth
letting
his
few
relations
know
nothing
of
him
he
had
been
rather
a
black
sheep
as
a
boy
but
milly
mother
had
liked
him
and
when
he
had
run
away
from
new
york
he
had
told
her
what
he
was
going
to
do
and
had
kissed
her
when
she
cried
and
had
taken
her
daguerreotype
with
him
now
he
had
written
and
it
turned
out
that
he
was
enormously
rich
and
was
interested
in
milly
from
that
time
uncle
james
formed
an
atmosphere
he
did
not
appear
in
new
york
but
milly
spent
the
next
season
in
london
and
the
monsons
being
at
hurlingham
one
day
had
her
pointed
out
to
them
as
a
new
american
girl
who
was
the
idol
of
a
millionaire
uncle
she
was
not
living
in
an
ultra
fashionable
quarter
or
with
ultra
fashionable
people
but
she
was
on
all
occasions
they
heard
beautifully
dressed
and
beautifully
if
a
little
heavily
hung
with
gauds
and
gems
her
rings
being
said
to
be
quite
amazing
and
suggesting
an
impassioned
lavishness
on
the
part
of
uncle
james
london
having
become
inured
to
american
marvels
milly
bit
of
it
accepted
and
enjoyed
uncle
james
and
all
the
sumptuous
attributes
of
his
dakota
english
people
would
swallow
anything
sometimes
monson
commented
sagely
and
yet
sometimes
they
stared
and
evidently
thought
you
were
lying
about
the
simplest
things
milly
corner
of
south
kensington
had
gulped
down
the
dakota
uncle
her
managing
in
this
way
if
there
was
no
uncle
was
too
clever
and
amusing
she
had
left
her
mother
at
home
to
scrimp
and
save
and
by
hook
or
by
crook
she
had
contrived
to
get
a
number
of
quite
good
things
to
wear
she
wore
them
with
such
an
air
of
accustomed
resource
that
the
jewels
might
easily
mixed
with
some
relics
of
her
mother
better
days
be
of
the
order
of
the
clever
little
parisian
diamond
crescent
it
was
milly
manner
which
did
it
the
announcement
of
her
union
with
sir
arthur
bowen
was
received
in
certain
new
york
circles
with
little
suppressed
shrieks
of
glee
it
had
been
so
sharp
of
her
to
aim
low
and
to
realise
so
quickly
that
she
could
not
aim
high
the
baronetcy
was
a
recent
one
and
not
unconnected
with
trade
sir
arthur
was
not
a
rich
man
and
had
it
leaked
out
believed
in
uncle
james
if
he
did
not
find
him
all
his
fancy
painted
milly
was
clever
enough
to
keep
him
quiet
she
was
when
all
was
said
and
done
one
of
the
american
women
of
title
her
servants
and
the
tradespeople
addressed
her
as
my
lady
and
with
her
capacity
for
appropriating
what
was
most
useful
and
her
easy
assumption
of
possessing
all
required
she
was
a
very
smart
person
indeed
she
provided
herself
with
an
english
accent
an
english
vocabulary
and
an
english
manner
and
in
certain
circles
was
felt
to
be
most
impressive
at
an
afternoon
function
in
the
country
vanderpoel
had
met
lady
bowen
she
had
been
one
of
the
few
kindly
ones
who
in
the
past
had
given
an
occasional
treat
to
milly
jones
for
her
girlhood
sake
lady
bowen
having
gathered
a
small
group
of
hearers
was
talking
volubly
to
it
when
the
nice
woman
entered
and
catching
sight
of
her
she
swept
across
the
room
it
would
not
have
been
like
milly
to
fail
to
see
and
greet
at
once
the
wife
of
reuben
vanderpoel
she
would
count
anywhere
even
in
london
sets
it
was
not
easy
to
connect
one
self
with
she
had
already
discovered
that
there
were
almost
as
many
difficulties
to
be
surmounted
in
london
by
the
wife
of
an
unimportant
baronet
as
there
had
been
to
be
overcome
in
new
york
by
a
girl
without
money
or
place
it
was
well
to
have
something
in
the
way
of
information
to
offer
in
one
small
talk
with
the
lucky
ones
and
milly
knew
what
subject
lay
nearest
to
vanderpoel
heart
miss
vanderpoel
has
evidently
been
enjoying
her
visit
to
stornham
court
she
said
after
her
first
few
sentences
i
met
worthington
at
the
embassy
and
she
said
she
had
buried
herself
in
the
country
but
i
think
she
must
have
run
up
to
town
quietly
for
shopping
i
saw
her
one
day
in
piccadilly
and
i
was
almost
sure
lady
anstruthers
was
with
her
in
the
carriage
almost
vanderpoel
heart
quickened
its
beat
you
were
so
young
when
she
married
she
said
i
daresay
you
have
forgotten
her
oh
no
milly
protested
effusively
i
remember
her
quite
well
she
was
so
pretty
and
pink
and
and
her
hair
curled
naturally
i
used
to
pray
every
night
that
when
i
grew
up
i
might
have
hair
and
a
complexion
like
vanderpoel
kind
maternal
face
fell
and
you
were
not
sure
you
recognised
her
well
i
suppose
twelve
years
does
make
a
difference
her
voice
dragging
a
little
milly
saw
that
she
had
made
a
blunder
the
fact
was
she
had
not
even
guessed
at
rosy
identity
until
long
after
the
carriage
had
passed
her
oh
you
see
she
hesitated
their
carriage
was
not
near
me
and
i
was
not
expecting
to
see
them
and
perhaps
she
looked
a
little
delicate
i
heard
she
had
been
rather
she
felt
she
was
floundering
and
bravely
floundered
away
from
the
subject
she
plunged
into
talk
of
betty
and
people
anxiety
to
see
her
and
the
fact
that
the
society
columns
were
already
faintly
heralding
her
she
would
surely
come
soon
to
town
it
was
too
late
for
the
first
this
year
when
did
vanderpoel
think
she
would
be
presented
would
lady
anstruthers
present
her
vanderpoel
could
not
bring
her
back
to
rosy
and
the
nature
of
the
change
which
had
made
it
difficult
to
recognise
her
the
result
of
this
chance
encounter
was
that
she
did
not
sleep
very
well
and
the
next
morning
talked
anxiously
to
her
husband
what
i
could
see
reuben
was
that
milly
bowen
had
not
known
her
at
all
even
when
she
saw
her
in
the
carriage
with
betty
she
could
have
changed
as
much
as
that
if
she
had
been
taken
care
of
and
her
affection
and
admiration
for
her
husband
were
such
as
made
the
task
of
soothing
her
a
comparatively
simple
thing
the
instinct
of
tenderness
for
the
mate
his
youth
had
chosen
was
an
unchangeable
one
in
reuben
vanderpoel
he
was
not
a
primitive
man
but
in
this
he
was
as
unquestioningly
simple
as
if
he
had
been
a
kindly
new
england
farmer
he
had
outgrown
his
wife
but
he
had
always
loved
and
protected
her
gentle
goodness
he
had
never
failed
her
in
her
smallest
difficulty
he
could
not
bear
to
see
her
hurt
betty
had
been
his
compeer
and
his
companion
almost
since
her
childhood
but
his
wife
was
the
tenderest
care
of
his
days
there
was
a
strong
sense
of
relief
in
his
thought
of
betty
now
it
was
good
to
remember
the
fineness
of
her
perceptions
her
clearness
of
judgment
and
recall
that
they
were
qualities
he
might
rely
upon
when
he
left
his
wife
to
take
his
train
to
town
he
left
her
smiling
again
she
scarcely
knew
how
her
fears
had
been
dispelled
his
talk
had
all
been
kindly
practical
and
reasonable
it
was
true
betty
had
said
in
her
letter
that
rosy
had
been
rather
delicate
and
had
not
been
taking
very
good
care
of
herself
but
that
was
to
be
remedied
rosy
had
made
a
little
joke
or
so
about
it
herself
betty
says
i
am
not
fat
enough
for
an
english
matron
i
am
drinking
milk
and
breakfasting
in
bed
and
am
going
to
be
massaged
to
please
her
i
believe
we
all
used
to
obey
betty
when
she
was
a
child
and
now
she
is
so
tall
and
splendid
one
would
never
dare
to
cross
her
oh
mother
i
am
so
happy
at
having
her
with
me
to
reread
just
these
simple
things
caused
the
suggestion
of
things
not
comfortably
normal
to
melt
away
vanderpoel
sat
down
at
a
sunny
window
with
her
lap
full
of
letters
and
forgot
milly
floundering
when
vanderpoel
reached
his
office
and
glanced
at
his
carefully
arranged
morning
mail
germen
saw
him
smile
at
the
sight
of
the
envelopes
addressed
in
his
daughter
hand
he
sat
down
to
read
them
at
once
and
as
he
read
the
smile
of
welcome
became
a
shrewd
and
deeply
interested
one
she
has
undertaken
a
contract
he
was
saying
to
himself
and
she
to
be
trusted
to
see
it
through
it
is
rather
fine
the
way
she
manages
to
combine
emotions
and
romance
and
sentiments
with
practical
good
business
without
letting
one
interfere
with
the
other
it
none
of
it
bad
business
this
as
the
estate
is
entailed
and
the
boy
is
rosy
it
good
this
was
what
betty
had
written
to
her
father
in
new
york
from
stornham
court
the
things
i
am
beginning
to
do
it
would
be
impossible
for
me
to
resist
doing
and
it
would
certainly
be
impossible
for
you
the
thing
i
am
seeing
i
have
never
seen
at
close
hand
before
though
i
have
taken
in
something
almost
its
parallel
as
part
of
certain
picturesqueness
of
scenes
in
other
countries
but
i
am
living
with
this
and
also
through
relationship
to
rosy
i
in
a
measure
belong
to
it
and
it
belongs
to
me
you
and
i
may
have
often
seen
in
american
villages
crudeness
incompleteness
lack
of
comfort
and
the
composition
of
a
picture
a
rough
ugliness
the
result
of
haste
and
unsettled
life
which
stays
nowhere
long
but
packs
up
its
goods
and
chattels
and
wanders
farther
afield
in
search
of
something
better
or
worse
in
any
case
in
search
of
change
but
we
have
never
seen
ripe
gradual
falling
to
ruin
of
what
generations
ago
was
beautiful
to
me
it
is
wonderful
and
tragic
and
touching
if
you
could
see
the
court
if
you
could
see
the
village
if
you
could
see
the
church
if
you
could
see
the
people
all
quietly
disintegrating
and
so
dearly
perfect
in
their
way
that
if
one
knew
absolutely
that
nothing
could
be
done
to
save
them
one
could
only
stand
still
and
catch
one
breath
and
burst
into
tears
the
church
has
stood
since
the
conquest
and
as
it
still
stands
grey
and
fine
with
its
mass
of
square
tower
and
despite
the
state
of
its
roof
is
not
yet
given
wholly
to
the
winds
and
weather
it
will
no
doubt
stand
a
few
centuries
longer
the
court
however
can
not
long
remain
a
possible
habitation
if
it
is
not
given
a
new
lease
of
life
i
do
not
mean
that
it
will
crumble
or
the
day
after
but
we
should
not
think
it
habitable
now
even
while
we
should
admit
that
nothing
could
be
more
delightful
to
look
at
the
cottages
in
the
village
are
already
many
of
them
amazing
when
regarded
as
the
dwellings
of
human
beings
how
long
ago
the
cottagers
gave
up
expecting
that
anything
in
particular
would
be
done
for
them
i
do
not
know
i
am
impressed
by
the
fact
that
they
are
an
unexpecting
people
their
calm
fills
me
with
interest
only
centuries
of
waiting
for
their
superiors
in
rank
to
do
things
for
them
and
the
slow
formation
of
the
habit
of
realising
that
not
to
submit
to
disappointment
was
no
use
could
have
produced
the
almost
serenity
of
their
attitude
it
is
all
very
well
for
newborn
republican
nations
meaning
my
native
land
to
sniff
sternly
and
say
that
such
a
state
of
affairs
is
an
insult
to
the
spirit
of
the
race
perhaps
it
is
now
but
it
was
not
apparently
centuries
ago
which
was
when
it
all
began
and
when
and
the
had
not
developed
to
the
point
of
asking
questions
to
which
they
demand
replies
about
themselves
and
the
things
which
happened
to
them
it
began
in
the
time
of
egbert
and
canute
and
earlier
in
the
days
of
the
druids
when
they
used
peacefully
to
allow
themselves
to
be
burned
by
the
score
enclosed
in
wicker
idols
as
natural
offerings
to
placate
the
gods
the
modern
acceptance
of
things
is
only
a
somewhat
attenuated
remnant
of
the
ancient
idea
and
this
is
what
i
have
to
deal
with
and
understand
when
i
begin
to
do
the
things
i
am
going
to
do
with
the
aid
of
your
practical
advice
if
i
have
your
approval
the
people
will
be
at
first
rather
afraid
of
me
they
will
privately
suspect
i
am
mad
it
will
also
not
seem
at
all
unlikely
that
an
american
should
be
of
unreasoningly
extravagant
and
flighty
mind
stornham
having
long
slumbered
in
remote
peace
through
lack
of
railroad
convenience
still
regards
america
as
almost
of
the
character
of
wild
rumour
rosy
was
their
one
american
and
she
disappeared
from
their
view
so
soon
that
she
had
not
time
to
make
any
lasting
impression
i
am
asking
myself
how
difficult
or
how
simple
it
will
be
to
quite
understand
these
people
and
to
make
them
understand
me
i
greatly
doubt
its
being
simple
layers
and
layers
and
layers
of
centuries
must
be
far
from
easy
to
burrow
through
they
look
simple
they
do
not
know
that
they
are
not
simple
but
really
they
are
not
their
point
of
view
has
been
the
point
of
view
of
the
english
peasant
so
many
hundred
years
that
an
american
point
of
view
which
has
had
no
more
than
a
trifling
century
and
a
half
to
form
itself
in
may
find
its
thews
and
sinews
the
less
powerful
of
the
two
when
i
walk
down
the
village
street
faces
appear
at
windows
and
figures
stolidly
at
doors
what
i
see
is
that
vaguely
and
remotely
american
though
i
am
the
fact
that
i
am
of
ladyship
blood
and
that
her
ladyship
american
though
she
is
has
the
claim
on
them
of
being
the
mother
of
the
son
of
the
owner
of
the
land
stirs
in
them
a
feeling
that
i
have
a
shadowy
sort
of
relationship
in
the
whole
thing
and
with
regard
to
their
bad
roofs
and
bad
chimneys
to
their
broken
palings
and
damp
floors
to
their
comforts
and
discomforts
a
sort
of
responsibility
that
is
the
whole
thing
and
you
just
you
father
will
understand
me
when
i
say
that
i
actually
like
it
i
might
not
like
it
if
i
were
poor
rosy
but
being
myself
i
love
it
there
is
something
patriarchal
in
it
which
moves
me
is
it
an
abounding
and
arrogant
delight
in
power
which
makes
it
appeal
to
me
or
is
it
something
better
to
feel
that
every
man
on
the
land
every
woman
every
child
knew
one
counted
on
one
honour
and
friendship
turned
to
one
believingly
in
time
of
stress
to
know
that
one
could
help
and
be
a
finely
faithful
thing
the
very
knowledge
of
it
would
give
one
vigour
and
warm
blood
in
the
veins
i
wish
i
had
been
born
to
it
i
wish
the
first
sounds
falling
on
my
newborn
ears
had
been
the
clanging
of
the
peal
from
an
old
norman
church
tower
calling
out
to
me
newcomer
of
our
house
long
life
among
us
welcome
still
though
the
first
sounds
that
greeted
me
were
probably
the
rattling
of
a
fifth
avenue
stage
i
have
brought
them
something
and
who
knows
whether
i
could
have
brought
it
from
without
the
range
of
that
prosaic
but
cheerful
the
rest
of
the
letter
was
detail
of
a
order
a
large
envelope
contained
the
of
things
to
be
done
notes
concerning
roofs
windows
flooring
park
fences
gardens
greenhouses
tool
houses
potting
sheds
garden
walls
gates
woodwork
masonry
sharp
little
sketches
such
as
buttle
had
seen
notes
concerning
buttle
fox
tread
kedgers
and
less
accomplished
workmen
concerning
wages
of
day
labourers
hours
capabilities
buttle
if
he
had
chanced
to
see
them
would
have
broken
into
a
light
perspiration
at
the
idea
of
a
young
woman
having
compiled
the
documents
he
had
never
heard
of
the
first
reuben
vanderpoel
her
father
reply
to
betty
was
as
long
as
her
own
to
him
and
gave
her
keen
pleasure
by
its
support
both
of
sympathetic
interest
and
practical
advice
he
left
none
of
her
points
unnoted
and
dealt
with
each
of
them
as
she
had
most
hoped
and
indeed
had
felt
she
knew
he
would
this
was
his
final
summing
up
if
you
had
been
a
boy
and
i
own
i
am
glad
you
were
not
a
man
wants
a
daughter
i
should
have
been
quite
willing
to
allow
you
your
flutter
on
wall
street
or
your
try
at
anything
you
felt
you
would
like
to
handle
it
would
have
interested
me
to
look
on
and
see
what
you
were
made
of
what
you
wanted
and
how
you
set
about
trying
to
get
it
it
a
new
kind
of
deal
you
have
undertaken
it
more
romantic
than
wall
street
but
i
think
i
do
see
what
you
see
in
it
even
apart
from
rosy
and
the
boy
it
would
interest
me
to
see
what
you
would
do
with
it
this
is
your
i
like
the
way
you
face
it
if
you
were
a
son
instead
of
a
daughter
i
should
see
i
might
have
confidence
in
you
i
could
not
confide
to
wall
street
what
i
will
tell
you
which
is
that
in
the
midst
of
the
drive
and
swirl
and
tumult
of
my
life
here
i
like
what
you
see
in
the
thing
i
like
your
idea
of
the
lord
of
the
land
who
should
love
the
land
and
the
souls
born
on
it
and
be
the
friend
and
strength
of
them
and
give
the
best
and
get
it
back
in
fair
exchange
there
a
steadiness
in
the
thought
of
such
a
life
among
one
kind
which
has
attractions
for
a
man
who
has
spent
years
in
a
maelstrom
snatching
at
what
whirls
among
the
eddies
of
it
your
notes
and
sketches
and
summing
up
of
probable
costs
did
us
both
credit
i
say
because
your
business
education
is
the
result
of
our
long
talks
and
journeyings
together
you
began
to
train
for
this
when
you
began
going
to
visit
mines
and
railroads
with
me
at
twelve
years
old
i
leave
the
whole
thing
in
your
hands
my
girl
i
leave
rosy
in
your
hands
and
in
leaving
rosy
to
you
you
know
how
i
am
trusting
you
with
your
mother
your
letters
to
her
tell
her
only
what
is
good
for
her
she
is
beginning
to
look
happier
and
younger
already
and
is
looking
forward
to
the
day
when
rosy
and
the
boy
will
come
home
to
visit
us
and
when
we
shall
go
in
state
to
stornham
court
god
bless
her
she
is
made
up
of
affection
and
simple
trust
and
that
makes
it
easy
to
keep
things
from
her
she
has
never
been
and
she
knows
i
love
her
so
when
i
tell
her
that
things
are
coming
right
she
never
doubts
me
while
you
are
rebuilding
the
place
you
will
rebuild
rosy
so
that
the
sight
of
her
may
not
be
a
pain
when
her
mother
sees
her
again
which
is
what
she
is
living
chapter
xxiii
introducing
selden
a
bird
was
perched
upon
a
swaying
branch
of
a
slim
young
sapling
near
the
hedge
which
bounded
the
park
and
mount
dunstan
had
stopped
to
look
at
it
and
listen
a
soft
shower
had
fallen
and
after
its
passing
the
sun
coming
through
the
light
clouds
there
had
broken
forth
again
in
the
trees
brief
trills
and
calls
and
fluting
of
bird
notes
the
sward
and
ferns
glittered
fresh
green
under
the
raindrops
the
young
leaves
on
trees
and
hedge
seemed
visibly
to
uncurl
the
uncovered
earth
looked
richly
dark
and
moist
and
sent
forth
the
fragrance
from
its
deeps
which
rising
to
a
man
nostrils
stirs
and
thrills
him
because
it
is
the
scent
of
life
self
the
bird
upon
the
sapling
was
a
robin
the
tiny
round
body
perched
upon
his
delicate
legs
plump
and
bright
plumaged
for
mating
he
touched
his
warm
red
breast
with
his
beak
fluffed
out
and
shook
his
feathers
and
swelling
his
throat
poured
forth
his
small
entranced
song
it
was
a
gay
brief
jaunty
thing
but
pure
joyous
gallant
liquid
melody
there
was
dainty
bravado
in
it
saucy
demand
and
allurement
it
was
addressed
to
some
invisible
hearer
of
the
tender
sex
and
wheresoever
she
might
be
hidden
whether
in
great
branch
or
low
thicket
or
hedge
there
was
hinted
no
doubt
in
her
small
wooer
note
that
she
would
hear
it
and
in
due
time
respond
mount
dunstan
listening
even
laughed
at
its
confident
music
the
tiny
thing
uttering
its
call
of
the
world
jubilant
in
the
surety
of
answer
having
flung
it
forth
he
paused
a
moment
and
waited
his
small
head
turned
sideways
his
big
round
black
eye
roguishly
attentive
then
with
more
swelling
of
the
throat
he
trilled
and
rippled
gayly
anew
undisturbed
and
undoubting
but
with
a
trifle
of
insistence
then
he
listened
tried
again
two
or
three
times
with
brave
chirps
and
exultant
little
roulades
here
am
i
the
the
the
the
joyous
and
conquering
listen
to
me
listen
to
me
listen
and
answer
in
the
call
of
god
it
was
the
joy
and
triumphant
faith
in
the
tiny
note
of
the
tiny
thing
life
as
he
himself
was
though
life
whose
mystery
his
man
hand
could
have
crushed
which
while
he
laughed
set
mount
dunstan
thinking
spring
warmth
and
spring
scents
and
spring
notes
set
a
man
being
in
tune
with
infinite
things
the
bright
roulade
began
again
prolonged
itself
with
renewed
effort
rose
to
its
height
and
ended
from
a
bush
in
the
thicket
farther
up
the
road
a
liquid
answer
came
and
mount
dunstan
laugh
at
the
sound
of
it
was
echoed
by
another
which
came
apparently
from
the
bank
rising
from
the
road
on
the
other
side
of
the
hedge
and
accompanying
the
laugh
was
a
nasal
voice
she
caught
on
there
no
mistake
about
that
i
guess
it
time
for
you
to
hustle
mount
dunstan
laughed
again
jem
salter
had
heard
voices
like
it
and
cheerful
slang
phrases
of
the
same
order
in
his
ranch
days
on
the
other
side
of
his
park
fence
there
was
evidently
sitting
through
some
odd
chance
an
american
of
the
cheery
casual
order
not
sufficiently
polished
by
travel
to
have
lost
his
picturesque
national
characteristics
mount
dunstan
put
a
hand
on
a
broken
panel
of
fence
and
leaped
over
into
the
road
a
bicycle
was
lying
upon
the
roadside
grass
and
on
the
bank
looking
as
though
he
had
been
sheltering
himself
under
the
hedge
from
the
rain
sat
a
young
man
in
a
cheap
bicycling
suit
his
features
were
sharply
cut
and
keen
his
cap
was
pushed
back
from
his
forehead
and
he
had
a
pair
of
shrewdly
careless
boyish
eyes
mount
dunstan
liked
the
look
of
him
and
seeing
his
natural
start
at
the
unheralded
leap
over
the
gap
which
was
quite
close
to
him
he
spoke
he
said
i
am
afraid
i
startled
was
the
response
it
was
a
bit
of
a
jolt
seeing
you
jump
almost
over
my
shoulder
where
did
you
come
from
you
must
have
been
just
behind
i
was
explained
mount
dunstan
standing
in
the
park
listening
to
the
the
young
fellow
laughed
outright
say
he
said
that
was
pretty
fine
was
it
was
he
getting
it
off
his
chest
he
was
an
english
robin
i
guess
american
robins
are
three
or
four
times
as
big
i
liked
that
little
chap
he
was
a
you
are
an
american
sure
nodding
good
old
stars
and
stripes
for
mine
first
time
been
here
came
part
for
business
and
part
for
pleasure
having
the
time
of
my
mount
dunstan
sat
down
beside
him
he
wanted
to
hear
him
talk
he
had
liked
to
hear
the
ranchmen
talk
this
one
was
of
the
city
type
but
his
genial
conversational
wanderings
would
be
full
of
quaint
slang
and
good
spirits
he
was
quite
ready
to
converse
as
was
made
manifest
by
his
next
speech
i
biking
through
the
country
because
i
once
had
an
old
grandmother
that
was
english
and
she
was
always
talking
about
english
country
and
how
green
things
was
and
how
there
was
hedges
instead
of
rail
fences
she
thought
there
was
nothing
like
little
old
england
well
as
far
as
roads
and
hedges
go
i
with
her
they
all
right
i
wanted
a
fellow
i
met
crossing
to
come
with
me
but
he
took
a
cook
trip
to
paris
he
a
gay
sort
of
boy
said
he
did
want
any
green
lanes
in
his
he
wanted
he
laughed
again
and
pushed
his
cap
farther
back
on
his
forehead
said
i
was
much
of
a
sport
i
tell
you
a
chap
got
to
earn
his
fifteen
per
and
live
on
it
ca
be
too
much
of
a
fifteen
per
mount
dunstan
repeated
doubtfully
his
companion
chuckled
i
forgot
i
was
talking
to
an
englishman
fifteen
dollars
per
week
that
what
per
means
that
what
he
told
me
he
gets
at
lobenstien
brewery
in
new
york
fifteen
per
not
much
is
it
how
does
he
manage
continental
travel
on
fifteen
per
mount
dunstan
inquired
he
a
typewriter
and
stenographer
and
he
dug
up
some
extra
jobs
to
do
at
night
he
been
working
and
saving
two
years
to
do
this
we
come
over
on
one
of
the
big
liners
with
the
four
hundred
you
can
bet
took
a
cheap
one
inside
cabin
second
by
george
said
mount
dunstan
that
was
the
american
eagle
slightly
flapped
his
wings
the
young
man
pushed
his
cap
a
trifle
sideways
this
time
and
flushed
a
little
well
when
an
american
wants
anything
he
generally
reaches
out
for
was
it
rather
rash
considering
the
fifteen
per
mount
dunstan
suggested
he
was
really
beginning
to
enjoy
himself
what
the
use
of
making
a
dollar
and
sitting
on
it
i
not
got
fifteen
per
steady
and
here
i
mount
dunstan
knew
his
man
and
looked
at
him
with
inquiring
interest
he
was
quite
sure
he
would
go
on
this
was
a
thing
he
had
seen
before
an
utter
freedom
from
the
insular
grudging
reserve
a
sort
of
occult
perception
of
the
presence
of
friendly
sympathy
and
an
ingenuous
readiness
to
meet
it
half
way
the
youngster
having
missed
his
and
probably
feeling
the
lack
of
companionship
in
his
country
rides
was
in
the
mood
for
i
selling
for
a
big
concern
he
said
and
i
got
a
article
to
carry
up
to
date
you
know
and
all
that
it
the
top
notch
of
typewriting
machines
the
delkoff
ever
seen
it
here
my
card
taking
a
card
from
an
inside
pocket
and
handing
it
to
him
it
was
inscribed
burridge
son
delkoff
typewriter
broadway
new
york
selden
that
my
name
he
said
pointing
to
the
inscription
in
the
corner
i
selden
the
junior
assistant
of
at
the
sight
of
the
insignia
of
his
trade
his
holiday
air
dropped
from
him
and
he
hastily
drew
from
another
pocket
an
illustrated
catalogue
if
you
use
a
typewriter
he
broke
forth
i
can
assure
you
it
would
be
to
your
interest
to
look
at
and
as
mount
dunstan
took
the
proffered
pamphlet
and
with
amiable
gravity
opened
it
he
rapidly
poured
forth
his
salesman
patter
scarcely
pausing
to
take
his
breath
it
the
most
machine
on
the
market
it
has
all
the
latest
improved
mechanical
appliances
you
will
see
from
the
cut
in
the
catalogue
that
the
platen
roller
is
easily
removed
without
a
long
mechanical
operation
all
you
do
is
to
slip
two
pins
back
and
off
comes
the
roller
there
is
also
another
point
worth
mentioning
the
ribbon
switch
by
using
this
ribbon
switch
you
can
write
in
either
red
or
blue
ink
while
you
are
using
only
one
ribbon
by
throwing
the
switch
on
this
side
you
can
use
thirteen
yards
on
the
upper
edge
of
the
ribbon
by
reversing
it
you
use
thirteen
yards
on
the
lower
edge
thus
getting
practically
yards
of
good
serviceable
ribbon
out
of
one
that
is
only
thirteen
yards
long
making
a
saving
of
fifty
per
cent
in
your
ribbon
expenditure
alone
which
you
will
see
is
quite
an
item
to
any
enterprising
he
was
obliged
to
pause
here
for
a
second
or
so
but
as
mount
dunstan
exhibited
no
signs
of
intending
to
use
violence
and
on
the
contrary
continued
to
inspect
the
catalogue
he
broke
forth
with
renewed
cheery
volubility
another
advantage
is
the
new
basket
shift
also
the
carriage
on
this
machine
is
perfectly
stationary
and
rigid
on
all
other
machines
it
is
fastened
by
a
series
of
connecting
bolts
and
links
which
you
will
readily
understand
makes
perfect
alignment
uncertain
then
our
tabulator
is
a
part
and
parcel
of
the
instrument
costing
you
nothing
more
than
the
original
price
of
the
machine
which
is
one
hundred
dollars
without
it
seems
a
good
thing
said
mount
dunstan
if
i
had
much
business
to
transact
i
should
buy
if
you
bought
one
you
have
business
responded
selden
what
the
matter
it
the
machines
that
set
things
humming
a
slow
typewriter
uses
a
firm
time
and
time
i
do
find
it
so
said
mount
dunstan
i
have
more
time
than
i
can
possibly
use
and
no
selden
looked
at
him
with
friendly
interest
his
experience
which
was
varied
had
taught
him
to
recognize
symptoms
this
nice
chap
who
despite
his
rather
shabby
clothes
looked
like
a
gentleman
wore
an
expression
jones
junior
assistant
had
seen
many
a
time
before
he
had
seen
it
frequently
on
the
countenances
of
other
junior
assistants
who
had
tramped
the
streets
and
met
more
or
less
savage
rebuffs
through
a
day
length
without
disposing
of
a
single
delkoff
and
thereby
adding
five
dollars
to
the
ten
per
it
was
the
kind
of
thing
which
wiped
the
youth
out
of
a
man
face
and
gave
him
a
hard
worn
look
about
the
eyes
he
had
looked
like
that
himself
many
an
unfeeling
day
before
he
had
learned
to
know
the
ropes
and
not
mind
a
bit
of
hot
his
buoyant
slangy
soul
was
a
friendly
thing
he
was
a
gregarious
creature
and
liked
his
fellow
man
he
felt
indeed
more
at
ease
with
him
when
he
needed
jollying
reticence
was
not
even
etiquette
in
a
case
as
usual
as
this
say
he
broke
out
perhaps
i
ought
to
have
worried
you
are
you
up
against
it
down
on
your
luck
i
mean
in
hasty
translation
mount
dunstan
grinned
a
little
that
a
very
good
way
of
putting
it
he
answered
i
never
heard
against
it
before
it
good
yes
i
up
against
it
out
of
a
job
with
genial
sympathy
well
the
job
i
had
was
too
big
for
me
it
needed
he
grinned
slightly
again
recalling
a
phrase
of
his
western
past
i
afraid
down
and
no
you
not
with
cheerful
scorn
you
not
dead
are
you
as
a
man
not
been
dead
a
month
there
always
a
chance
that
luck
round
the
corner
how
did
you
happen
here
are
you
piking
it
momentarily
mount
dunstan
was
baffled
selden
recognising
the
fact
enlightened
him
that
new
york
again
he
said
with
a
boyish
touch
of
apology
it
means
on
the
tramp
travelling
along
the
turnpike
you
do
look
as
if
you
had
come
to
that
though
it
queer
the
sort
of
fellows
you
do
meet
piking
sometimes
theatrical
companies
that
have
gone
to
pieces
on
the
road
you
know
perhaps
with
a
sudden
thought
you
an
actor
are
you
mount
dunstan
admitted
to
himself
that
he
liked
the
junior
assistant
of
jones
immensely
a
more
ingenuously
common
young
man
a
more
innocent
outsider
it
had
never
been
his
blessed
privilege
to
enter
into
close
converse
with
but
his
very
commonness
was
a
healthy
normal
thing
it
made
no
effort
to
wreathe
itself
with
chaplets
of
elegance
it
was
beautifully
unaware
that
such
adornment
was
necessary
it
enjoyed
itself
youthfully
attacked
the
earning
of
its
bread
with
genial
pluck
and
its
humanness
had
touched
him
he
had
enjoyed
his
talk
he
wanted
to
hear
more
of
it
he
was
not
in
the
mood
to
let
him
go
his
way
to
penzance
who
was
to
lunch
with
him
he
would
present
a
study
of
absorbing
interest
no
he
answered
i
not
an
actor
my
name
is
mount
dunstan
and
this
place
with
a
nod
over
his
shoulder
is
mine
but
i
up
against
it
selden
looked
a
trifle
disgusted
he
began
to
pick
up
his
bicycle
he
had
given
a
degree
of
natural
sympathy
and
this
was
an
english
idea
of
a
joke
i
the
prince
of
wales
myself
he
remarked
and
my
expecting
me
to
lunch
at
windsor
so
long
me
lord
and
he
set
his
foot
on
the
treadle
mount
dunstan
rose
feeling
rather
awkward
the
point
seemed
somewhat
difficult
to
contend
it
is
not
a
joke
he
said
conscious
that
he
spoke
rather
stiffly
little
willie
not
quite
as
easy
as
he
looks
was
the
cryptic
remark
of
selden
mount
dunstan
lost
his
rather
easily
lost
temper
which
happened
to
be
the
best
thing
he
could
have
done
under
the
circumstances
damn
it
he
burst
out
i
not
such
a
fool
as
i
evidently
look
a
nice
ass
i
should
be
to
play
an
idiot
joke
like
that
i
speaking
the
truth
go
if
you
like
and
be
selden
attention
was
arrested
the
fellow
was
in
earnest
the
place
was
his
he
must
be
the
earl
chap
he
had
heard
spoken
of
at
the
wayside
public
house
he
had
stopped
at
for
a
pot
of
beer
he
dismounted
from
his
bicycle
and
came
back
pushing
it
before
him
relenting
and
awkwardness
combining
in
his
look
all
right
he
said
i
apologise
if
it
cold
fact
i
not
calling
you
a
thank
you
still
a
little
stiffly
from
mount
dunstan
the
unabashed
good
cheer
of
selden
carried
him
lightly
over
a
slightly
difficult
moment
he
laughed
pushing
his
cap
back
of
course
and
looking
over
the
hedge
at
the
sweep
of
park
with
a
group
of
deer
cropping
softly
in
the
foreground
i
guess
i
should
get
a
bit
hot
myself
he
volunteered
handsomely
if
i
was
an
earl
and
owned
a
place
like
this
and
a
fool
fellow
came
along
and
took
me
for
a
tramp
that
was
a
pretty
bad
break
was
it
but
i
did
say
you
did
look
like
it
anyway
you
need
mind
me
i
get
onto
pierpont
morgan
or
vanderbilt
if
i
met
in
the
he
spoke
the
two
names
as
an
englishman
of
his
class
would
have
spoken
of
the
dukes
of
westminster
or
marlborough
these
were
his
nobles
the
heads
of
the
great
american
houses
and
entirely
parallel
in
his
mind
with
the
heads
of
any
great
house
in
england
they
wielded
the
power
of
the
world
and
could
wield
it
for
evil
or
good
as
any
prince
or
duke
might
mount
dunstan
saw
the
parallel
i
apologise
all
right
selden
ended
genially
i
am
not
offended
mount
dunstan
answered
there
was
no
reason
why
you
should
know
me
from
another
man
i
was
taken
for
a
gamekeeper
a
few
weeks
since
i
was
savage
a
moment
because
you
refused
to
believe
me
and
why
should
you
believe
me
after
all
selden
hesitated
he
liked
the
fellow
anyhow
you
said
you
were
up
against
it
that
was
it
and
and
i
seen
chaps
down
on
their
luck
often
enough
good
lord
the
stories
i
hear
every
day
of
my
life
and
they
get
a
sort
of
look
about
the
eyes
and
mouth
i
hate
to
see
it
on
any
fellow
it
makes
me
sort
of
sick
to
come
across
it
even
in
a
chap
that
only
got
his
fool
self
to
blame
i
may
be
making
another
break
telling
you
but
you
looked
sort
of
that
perhaps
stolidly
i
then
his
voice
warming
it
was
jolly
of
you
to
think
about
it
at
all
thank
that
all
right
in
polite
acknowledgment
then
with
another
look
over
the
hedge
say
what
ought
i
to
call
you
earl
or
my
lord
it
not
necessary
for
you
to
call
me
anything
in
particular
as
a
rule
if
you
were
speaking
of
me
you
might
say
lord
mount
selden
looked
relieved
i
do
want
to
be
too
much
off
he
said
and
i
like
to
ask
you
a
favour
i
only
three
weeks
here
and
i
do
want
to
miss
any
what
chance
would
you
like
one
of
the
things
i
biking
over
the
country
for
is
to
get
a
look
at
just
such
a
place
as
this
we
have
got
in
america
my
old
grandmother
was
always
talking
about
them
before
her
mother
brought
her
to
new
york
she
lived
in
a
village
near
some
park
gates
and
she
chinned
about
it
till
she
died
when
i
was
a
little
chap
i
liked
to
hear
her
she
was
much
of
an
american
wore
a
black
net
cap
with
purple
ribbons
in
it
and
had
outlived
her
respect
for
aristocracy
gee
chuckling
if
she
heard
what
i
said
to
you
just
now
i
reckon
have
thrown
a
fit
anyhow
she
made
me
feel
i
like
to
see
the
kind
of
places
she
talked
about
and
i
shall
think
myself
in
luck
if
let
me
have
a
look
at
yours
just
a
bike
around
the
park
if
you
object
or
i
leave
the
bike
outside
if
you
i
do
object
at
all
said
mount
dunstan
the
fact
is
i
happened
to
be
on
the
point
of
asking
you
to
come
and
have
some
lunch
when
you
got
on
your
selden
pushed
his
cap
and
cleared
his
throat
i
was
expecting
that
he
said
i
pretty
dusty
with
a
glance
at
his
clothes
i
need
a
wash
and
brush
up
particularly
if
there
are
there
were
no
ladies
and
he
could
be
made
comfortable
this
being
explained
to
him
he
was
obviously
rejoiced
with
unembarrassed
frankness
he
expressed
exultation
such
luck
had
not
at
any
time
presented
itself
to
him
as
a
possibility
in
his
holiday
scheme
by
gee
he
ejaculated
as
they
walked
under
the
broad
oaks
of
the
avenue
leading
to
the
house
speaking
of
luck
this
is
the
limit
i
ca
help
thinking
of
what
my
grandmother
would
say
if
she
saw
he
was
a
new
order
of
companion
but
before
they
had
reached
the
house
mount
dunstan
had
begun
to
find
him
inspiring
to
the
spirits
his
jovial
if
crude
youth
his
unaffected
acknowledgment
of
unaccustomedness
to
grandeur
even
when
in
dilapidation
his
delight
in
the
novelty
of
the
particular
forms
of
everything
about
him
trees
and
sward
ferns
and
moss
his
open
were
without
doubt
cheerful
things
his
exclamation
when
they
came
within
sight
of
the
house
itself
was
for
a
moment
disturbing
to
mount
dunstan
composure
hully
gee
he
said
the
old
lady
was
right
all
i
thought
about
was
off
it
bigger
than
a
his
approval
was
immense
during
the
absence
in
which
he
was
supplied
with
the
wash
and
brush
up
mount
dunstan
found
penzance
in
the
library
he
explained
to
him
what
he
had
encountered
and
how
it
had
attracted
him
you
have
liked
to
hear
me
describe
my
western
neighbours
he
said
this
youngster
is
a
new
york
development
and
of
a
different
type
but
there
is
a
likeness
i
have
invited
to
lunch
with
us
a
young
man
whom
tenham
for
instance
if
he
were
here
would
call
bounder
he
is
nothing
of
the
sort
in
his
way
he
is
rather
a
fine
thing
i
never
saw
anything
more
decently
human
than
his
way
of
asking
me
man
to
man
making
friends
by
the
roadside
if
i
was
against
it
no
other
fellow
i
have
known
has
ever
exhibited
the
same
healthy
the
reverend
lewis
was
entranced
already
he
was
really
quite
flushed
with
interest
as
assyrian
character
engraved
upon
sarcophogi
would
have
allured
and
thrilled
him
so
was
he
allured
by
the
cryptic
nature
of
the
two
or
three
american
slang
phrases
mount
dunstan
had
repeated
to
him
his
was
the
student
simple
ardour
up
against
it
he
echoed
really
dear
dear
and
that
signifies
you
say
apparently
it
means
that
a
man
has
come
face
to
face
with
an
obstacle
difficult
or
impossible
to
but
upon
my
word
that
is
not
bad
it
is
strong
figure
of
speech
it
brings
up
a
picture
a
man
hurrying
to
an
end
much
desired
comes
unexpectedly
upon
a
stone
wall
one
can
almost
hear
the
impact
he
is
up
against
it
most
vivid
excellent
excellent
the
nature
of
selden
calling
was
such
that
he
was
not
accustomed
to
being
received
with
a
hint
of
enthusiastic
welcome
there
was
something
almost
akin
to
this
in
the
vicar
courteously
amiable
aquiline
countenance
when
he
rose
to
shake
hands
with
the
young
man
on
his
entrance
penzance
was
indeed
slightly
disappointed
that
his
greeting
was
not
responded
to
by
some
characteristic
phrasing
his
american
was
that
of
sam
slick
and
artemus
ward
punch
and
various
english
witticisms
in
anecdote
life
at
the
vicarage
of
dunstan
had
not
revealed
to
him
that
the
model
had
become
archaic
the
revelation
dawned
upon
him
during
his
intercourse
with
selden
the
young
man
in
his
cheap
bicycling
suit
was
a
new
development
he
was
markedly
unlike
an
english
youth
of
his
class
as
he
was
neither
shy
nor
laboriously
at
his
ease
that
he
was
at
his
ease
to
quite
an
amazing
degree
might
perhaps
have
been
remotely
resented
by
the
insular
mind
accustomed
to
another
order
of
bearing
in
its
social
inferiors
had
it
not
been
so
obviously
founded
on
entire
unconsciousness
of
self
and
so
mingled
with
open
appreciation
of
the
unanticipated
pleasures
of
the
occasion
nothing
could
have
been
farther
from
selden
than
any
desire
to
attempt
to
convey
the
impression
that
he
had
enjoyed
the
hospitality
of
persons
of
rank
on
previous
occasions
he
found
indeed
a
gleeful
point
in
the
joke
of
the
incongruousness
of
his
own
presence
amid
such
surroundings
what
little
willie
was
expecting
he
remarked
once
to
the
keen
joy
of
penzance
was
a
hunk
of
bread
and
cheese
at
a
village
saloon
somewhere
i
ought
to
have
said
ought
i
you
do
call
them
saloons
he
was
encouraged
to
talk
and
in
his
fluency
he
opened
up
many
vistas
to
the
interested
penzance
who
found
himself
so
to
speak
whirled
along
broadway
rushed
up
the
steps
of
the
elevated
railroad
and
struggling
to
obtain
a
seat
or
a
strap
to
hang
to
on
a
sixth
avenue
train
the
man
was
saturated
with
the
atmosphere
of
the
hot
battle
he
lived
in
from
his
childhood
he
had
known
nothing
but
the
fever
heat
of
his
little
old
new
york
as
he
called
it
with
affectionate
slanginess
and
any
temperature
lower
than
that
he
was
accustomed
to
would
have
struck
him
as
being
below
normal
penzance
was
impressed
by
his
feeling
of
affection
for
the
amazing
city
of
his
birth
he
admired
he
adored
it
he
boasted
joyously
of
its
perfervid
charm
something
doing
he
said
that
what
my
sort
of
a
fellow
likes
something
doing
you
feel
it
right
there
when
you
walk
along
the
streets
little
old
new
york
for
mine
it
good
enough
for
little
willie
and
it
never
stops
why
broadway
at
night
he
forgot
his
chop
and
leaned
forward
on
the
table
to
pour
forth
his
description
the
manservant
standing
behind
mount
dunstan
chair
forgot
himself
also
thought
he
was
a
trained
domestic
whose
duty
it
was
to
present
dishes
to
the
attention
without
any
apparent
mental
processes
certainly
it
was
not
his
business
to
listen
and
gaze
fascinated
this
he
did
however
actually
for
the
time
unconscious
of
his
breach
of
manners
the
very
crudity
of
the
language
used
the
oddly
sounding
sometimes
not
easily
translatable
slang
phrases
used
as
if
they
were
a
necessary
part
of
any
conversation
the
blunt
uneducated
bareness
of
figure
seemed
to
penzance
to
make
more
roughly
vivid
the
picture
dashed
off
the
broad
thoroughfare
almost
as
thronged
by
night
as
by
day
crowds
going
to
theatres
loaded
electric
cars
whizzing
and
clanging
bells
the
elevated
railroad
rushing
and
roaring
past
within
hearing
theatre
fronts
flaming
with
electric
light
announcements
of
names
of
theatrical
stars
and
the
plays
they
appeared
in
electric
light
advertisements
of
brands
of
cigars
whiskies
breakfast
foods
all
blazing
high
in
the
night
air
in
such
number
and
with
such
strength
of
brilliancy
that
the
whole
thoroughfare
was
as
bright
with
light
as
a
ballroom
or
a
theatre
the
vicar
felt
himself
standing
in
the
midst
of
it
all
blinded
by
the
glare
sit
down
on
the
sidewalk
and
read
your
newspaper
a
book
a
magazine
any
old
thing
you
like
with
an
exultant
laugh
the
names
of
the
dramatic
stars
blazing
over
entrances
to
the
theatres
were
often
english
names
their
plays
english
plays
their
companies
made
up
of
english
men
and
women
selden
was
as
familiar
with
them
and
commented
upon
their
gifts
as
easily
as
if
he
had
drawn
his
drama
from
the
strand
instead
of
from
broadway
the
novels
piled
up
in
the
stations
of
what
he
called
the
l
which
revealed
itself
as
being
a
abbreviation
of
elevated
railroad
were
in
large
proportion
english
novels
and
he
had
his
ingenuous
estimate
of
english
novelists
as
well
as
of
all
else
ruddy
now
he
said
i
like
him
he
all
right
even
though
we
have
quite
caught
onto
india
the
dazzle
and
brilliancy
of
broadway
so
surrounded
penzance
that
he
found
it
necessary
to
withdraw
himself
and
return
to
his
immediate
surroundings
that
he
might
recover
from
his
sense
of
interested
bewilderment
his
eyes
fell
upon
the
stern
lineaments
of
a
mount
dunstan
in
a
costume
of
the
time
of
henry
viii
he
was
a
burly
gentleman
whose
thick
neck
and
haughty
fixedness
of
stare
from
the
background
of
his
portrait
were
such
as
seemed
to
eliminate
him
from
the
scheme
of
things
the
clanging
of
electric
cars
and
the
prevailing
roar
of
the
confronted
by
his
gaze
electric
light
advertisements
of
whiskies
cigars
and
corsets
seemed
impossible
he
all
right
continued
selden
i
ready
to
separate
myself
from
one
fifty
any
time
i
see
a
new
book
of
his
he
got
the
goods
with
the
richness
of
colloquialism
moved
the
vicar
of
mount
dunstan
to
deep
enjoyment
would
you
mind
i
trust
you
wo
he
apologised
courteously
telling
me
exactly
the
significance
of
those
two
last
sentences
in
think
i
see
their
meaning
but
selden
looked
apologetic
himself
well
it
slang
you
see
he
explained
i
guess
i
ca
help
it
you
flushing
a
trifle
but
without
any
touch
of
resentment
in
the
boyish
colour
you
know
what
sort
of
a
chap
i
am
i
not
passing
myself
off
as
anything
but
an
ordinary
business
hustler
am
i
just
under
salesman
to
a
typewriter
concern
i
should
like
to
think
got
in
here
on
any
bluff
i
guess
i
sling
in
slang
every
half
dozen
words
my
dear
boy
penzance
was
absolutely
moved
and
he
spoke
with
warmth
quite
paternal
lord
mount
dunstan
and
i
are
genuinely
interested
genuinely
he
because
he
knows
new
york
a
little
and
i
because
i

your
american
slang
has
frequently
a
delightful
meaning
a
fantastic
hilarity
or
common
sense
or
philosophy
hidden
in
its
origin
in
that
it
generally
differs
from
english
slang
which
i
regret
to
say
is
usually
founded
on
some
silly
catch
word
pray
go
on
when
you
see
a
new
book
by
kipling
you
are
ready
to
yourself
from
one
fifty
because
he
the
goods
with
him
selden
suppressed
an
involuntary
young
laugh
one
dollar
and
fifty
cents
is
usually
the
price
of
a
book
he
said
you
separate
yourself
from
it
when
you
take
it
out
of
your
clothes
i
mean
out
of
your
pocket
and
pay
it
over
the
there
a
careless
humour
in
it
said
mount
dunstan
grimly
the
suggestion
of
parting
is
not
half
bad
on
the
whole
it
is
a
great
deal
of
it
is
subtle
said
penzance
though
it
all
professes
to
be
obvious
the
other
sentence
has
a
commercial
when
a
man
goes
about
selling
for
a
concern
said
the
junior
assistant
of
jones
he
can
prove
what
he
says
if
he
has
the
goods
with
him
i
guess
it
came
from
that
i
do
know
i
only
know
that
when
a
man
is
a
straight
sort
of
fellow
and
can
show
up
we
say
he
got
the
goods
with
they
sat
after
lunch
in
the
library
before
an
open
window
looking
into
a
lovely
sunken
garden
blossoms
were
breaking
out
on
every
side
and
robins
thrushes
and
blackbirds
chirped
and
trilled
and
whistled
as
mount
dunstan
and
penzance
led
selden
on
to
paint
further
pictures
for
them
some
of
them
were
rather
painful
penzance
thought
as
connected
with
youth
they
held
a
touch
of
pathos
selden
was
all
unconscious
of
he
had
had
a
hard
life
made
up
since
his
tenth
year
of
struggles
to
earn
his
living
he
had
sold
newspapers
he
had
run
errands
he
had
swept
out
a
candy
he
had
had
a
few
years
at
the
public
school
and
a
few
months
at
a
business
college
to
which
he
went
at
night
after
work
hours
he
had
been
up
against
it
good
and
plenty
he
told
them
he
seemed
however
to
have
had
a
knack
of
making
friends
and
of
giving
them
a
boost
along
when
such
a
chance
was
possible
both
of
his
listeners
realised
that
a
good
many
people
had
liked
him
and
the
reason
was
apparent
enough
to
them
when
a
chap
gets
sorry
for
himself
he
remarked
once
he
down
and
out
that
a
fact
there
lots
of
stories
that
you
got
to
hear
anyhow
the
fellow
that
can
keep
his
to
himself
is
the
fellow
that
likely
to
get
get
there
the
vicar
murmured
reflectively
and
selden
chuckled
again
get
where
he
started
out
to
go
to
the
white
house
if
you
like
the
fellows
that
have
got
there
kept
their
hardluck
stories
quiet
i
bet
guess
most
of
had
plenty
during
election
if
they
were
the
kind
to
lie
awake
sobbing
on
their
pillows
because
their
feelings
were
he
had
never
been
sorry
for
himself
it
was
evident
though
it
must
be
admitted
that
there
were
moments
when
the
elderly
english
clergyman
whose
most
serious
encounters
had
been
annoying
interviews
with
cottagers
of
disrespectful
manner
rather
shuddered
as
he
heard
his
simple
recital
of
days
when
he
had
tramped
street
after
street
carrying
his
catalogue
with
him
and
trying
to
tell
his
story
of
the
delkoff
to
frantically
busy
men
who
were
driven
mad
by
the
importunate
sight
of
him
to
worried
ones
who
broke
into
fury
when
they
heard
his
voice
and
to
savage
brutes
who
were
only
restrained
by
law
from
kicking
him
into
the
street
you
got
to
take
it
if
you
do
want
to
lose
your
job
some
of
them
as
tired
as
you
are
sometimes
if
you
can
give
a
jolly
and
make
laugh
they
listen
and
you
may
unload
a
machine
but
no
merry
jest
just
at
first
particularly
in
bad
weather
the
first
five
weeks
i
was
with
the
delkoff
i
never
made
a
sale
had
to
live
on
my
ten
per
and
that
pretty
hard
in
new
york
three
and
a
half
for
your
hall
bedroom
and
the
rest
for
your
hash
and
shoes
but
i
held
on
and
gradually
luck
began
to
turn
and
i
began
not
to
care
so
much
when
a
man
gave
it
to
me
the
vicar
of
mount
dunstan
had
never
heard
of
the
hall
bedroom
as
an
institution
a
dozen
unconscious
sentences
placed
it
before
his
mental
vision
he
thought
it
horribly
touching
a
narrow
room
at
the
back
of
a
cheap
lodging
house
a
bed
a
strip
of
carpet
a
washstand
this
the
sole
refuge
of
a
male
human
creature
in
the
flood
tide
of
youth
no
more
than
this
to
come
back
to
nightly
footsore
and
resentful
of
soul
after
a
day
tramp
spent
in
forcing
himself
and
his
wares
on
people
who
did
not
want
him
or
them
and
who
found
infinite
variety
in
the
forcefulness
of
their
method
of
saying
so
what
you
know
when
you
go
into
a
place
is
that
nobody
wants
to
see
you
and
no
one
will
let
you
talk
if
they
can
help
it
the
only
thing
is
to
get
in
and
rattle
off
your
stunt
before
you
can
be
fired
sometimes
at
first
he
had
gone
back
at
night
to
the
hall
bedroom
and
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
narrow
bed
swinging
his
feet
and
asking
himself
how
long
he
could
hold
out
but
he
had
held
out
and
evidently
developed
into
a
good
salesman
being
bold
and
of
imperturbable
good
spirits
and
temper
and
not
troubled
by
hypersensitiveness
hearing
of
the
hall
bedroom
the
coldness
of
it
in
winter
and
the
breathless
heat
in
summer
the
utter
loneliness
of
it
at
all
times
and
seasons
one
could
not
have
felt
surprise
if
the
lad
doomed
to
its
narrowness
as
home
had
been
drawn
into
the
gaiety
of
broadway
and
being
caught
in
its
maelstrom
had
been
sucked
under
to
its
lowest
depths
but
it
was
to
be
observed
that
selden
had
a
clear
eye
and
a
healthy
skin
and
a
healthy
young
laugh
yet
which
were
all
wonderfully
to
his
credit
and
added
enormously
to
one
liking
for
him
do
you
use
a
typewriter
he
said
at
last
to
penzance
it
would
cut
out
half
your
work
with
your
sermons
if
you
do
use
one
i
just
like
to
call
your
attention
to
the
delkoff
it
the
most
machine
on
the
market
drawing
out
the
catalogue
i
do
not
use
one
and
i
am
extremely
sorry
to
say
that
i
could
not
afford
to
buy
one
said
penzance
with
considerate
courtesy
but
do
tell
me
about
it
i
am
afraid
i
never
saw
a
it
was
the
most
hospitable
thing
he
could
have
done
and
was
of
the
tact
of
courts
he
arranged
his
pince
nez
and
taking
the
catalogue
applied
himself
to
it
selden
soul
warmed
within
him
to
be
listened
to
like
this
to
be
treated
as
a
gentleman
by
a
gentleman
by
a
fine
old
swell
like
this
hully
gee
this
is
what
i
used
to
he
said
with
genuine
enjoyment
it
does
matter
your
not
being
ready
to
buy
now
you
may
be
sometime
or
you
may
run
up
against
someone
who
is
little
willie
always
ready
to
say
his
he
poured
it
forth
with
glee
the
improved
mechanical
appliances
the
cuts
in
the
catalogue
the
platen
roller
the
ribbon
switch
the
yards
of
red
or
blue
typing
the
fifty
per
cent
saving
in
ribbon
expenditure
alone
the
new
basket
shift
the
stationary
carriage
the
tabulator
the
superiority
to
all
other
typewriting
machines
the
price
one
hundred
dollars
without
discount
and
both
mount
dunstan
and
penzance
listened
entranced
examined
cuts
in
the
catalogue
asked
questions
and
in
fact
ended
by
finding
that
they
must
repress
an
actual
desire
to
possess
the
luxury
the
joy
their
attitude
bestowed
upon
selden
was
the
thing
he
would
feel
gave
the
finishing
touch
to
the
hours
which
he
would
recall
to
the
end
of
his
days
as
the
time
of
his
yes
by
gee
he
was
having
the
time
of
his
later
he
found
himself
feeling
as
miss
vanderpoel
had
felt
rather
as
if
the
whole
thing
was
a
dream
this
came
upon
him
when
with
mount
dunstan
and
penzance
he
walked
through
the
park
and
the
curiously
beautiful
old
gardens
the
lovely
soundless
quiet
broken
into
only
by
bird
notes
or
his
companions
voices
had
an
extraordinary
effect
on
him
it
so
still
you
can
hear
it
he
said
once
stopping
in
a
velvet
path
seems
like
you
got
quiet
shut
up
here
and
turned
it
on
till
the
air
thick
with
it
good
lord
think
of
little
old
broadway
keeping
it
up
and
the
l
whizzing
and
thundering
along
every
three
minutes
just
the
same
while
we
standing
here
you
believe
it
would
have
gone
hard
with
him
to
describe
to
them
the
value
of
his
enjoyment
again
and
again
there
came
back
to
him
the
memory
of
the
grandmother
who
wore
the
black
net
cap
trimmed
with
purple
ribbons
apparently
she
had
remained
to
the
last
almost
contumaciously
british
she
had
kept
photographs
of
queen
victoria
and
the
prince
consort
on
her
bedroom
mantelpiece
and
had
made
caustic
international
comparisons
but
she
had
seen
places
like
this
and
her
stories
became
realities
to
him
now
but
she
had
never
thought
of
the
possibility
of
any
chance
of
his
being
shown
about
by
the
lord
of
the
manor
himself
lunching
by
gee
and
talking
to
them
about
typewriters
he
vaguely
knew
that
if
the
grandmother
had
not
emigrated
and
he
had
been
born
in
dunstan
village
he
would
naturally
have
touched
his
forehead
to
mount
dunstan
and
the
vicar
when
they
passed
him
in
the
road
and
conversation
between
them
would
have
been
an
unlikely
thing
somehow
things
had
been
changed
by
destiny
perhaps
for
the
whole
of
them
as
years
had
passed
what
he
felt
when
he
stood
in
the
picture
gallery
neither
of
his
companions
could
at
first
guess
he
ceased
to
talk
and
wandered
silently
about
secretly
he
found
himself
a
trifle
awed
by
being
looked
down
upon
by
the
unchanging
eyes
of
men
in
strange
rich
garments
in
corslet
ruff
and
doublet
velvet
powder
curled
love
locks
brocade
and
lace
the
face
of
loveliness
smiled
out
from
its
canvas
or
withheld
itself
haughtily
from
his
salesman
gaze
wonderful
bare
white
shoulders
and
bosoms
clasped
with
gems
or
flowers
and
lace
defied
him
to
recall
any
treasures
of
broadway
to
compare
with
them
elderly
dames
garbed
in
stiff
splendour
held
stiff
unsympathetic
inquiry
in
their
eyes
as
they
looked
back
upon
him
what
exactly
was
a
thirty
shilling
bicycle
suit
doing
there
in
the
delkoff
plainly
none
were
interested
a
pretty
masquerading
shepherdess
with
a
lamb
and
a
crook
seemed
to
laugh
at
him
from
under
her
broad
beribboned
straw
hat
after
looking
at
her
for
a
minute
or
so
he
gave
a
half
laugh
himself
but
it
was
an
awkward
one
she
a
looker
he
remarked
they
a
lot
of
them
lookers
not
all
but
a
fair
show
a
looker
translated
mount
dunstan
in
a
low
voice
to
penzance
means
i
believe
a
young
women
with
good
looks
a
yes
she
is
a
looker
by
gee
said
selden
but
but
the
awkward
half
laugh
taking
on
a
depressed
touch
of
sheepishness
she
makes
me
feel
off
they
all
that
was
it
surrounded
by
them
he
was
fascinated
but
not
cheered
they
were
all
so
smilingly
or
disdainfully
or
indifferently
unconscious
of
the
existence
of
the
human
thing
of
his
class
his
aspect
his
life
and
his
desires
were
as
remote
as
those
of
prehistoric
man
his
broadway
his
l
railroad
his
delkoff
what
were
they
where
did
they
come
into
the
scheme
of
the
universe
they
silently
gazed
and
lightly
smiled
or
frowned
through
him
as
he
stood
he
was
probably
not
in
the
least
aware
that
he
rather
loudly
sighed
yes
he
said
they
make
me
feel
off
i
not
in
it
but
she
is
a
looker
get
onto
that
dimple
in
her
mount
dunstan
and
penzance
spent
the
afternoon
in
doing
their
best
for
him
he
was
well
worth
it
penzance
was
filled
with
delight
and
saturated
with
the
atmosphere
of
new
york
i
feel
he
said
softly
polishing
his
eyeglasses
and
almost
affectionately
smiling
i
really
feel
as
if
i
had
been
walking
down
broadway
or
fifth
avenue
i
believe
that
i
might
find
my
way
to
well
suppose
we
say
weber
field
and
selden
shouted
with
glee
never
before
in
fact
had
he
felt
his
heart
so
warmed
by
spontaneous
affection
as
it
was
by
this
elderly
somewhat
bald
and
clergyman
of
the
church
of
england
this
he
had
never
seen
before
without
the
trained
subtlety
to
have
explained
to
himself
the
finely
sweet
and
simply
gracious
deeps
of
it
he
was
moved
and
uplifted
he
was
glad
he
had
come
across
it
he
felt
a
vague
regret
at
passing
on
his
way
and
leaving
it
behind
he
would
have
liked
to
feel
that
perhaps
he
might
come
back
he
would
have
liked
to
present
him
with
a
delkoff
and
teach
him
how
to
run
it
he
had
delighted
in
mount
dunstan
and
rejoiced
in
him
but
he
had
rather
fallen
in
love
with
penzance
certain
american
doubts
he
had
had
of
the
solidity
and
permanency
of
england
position
and
power
were
somewhat
modified
when
fellows
like
these
two
stood
at
the
first
rank
little
old
england
was
a
pretty
safe
proposition
after
they
had
given
him
tea
among
the
scents
and
songs
of
the
sunken
garden
outside
the
library
window
they
set
him
on
his
way
the
shadows
were
lengthening
and
the
sunlight
falling
in
deepening
gold
when
they
walked
up
the
avenue
and
shook
hands
with
him
at
the
big
entrance
gates
well
gentlemen
he
said
you
treated
me
grand
as
fine
as
silk
and
it
wo
be
like
little
willie
to
forget
it
when
i
go
back
to
new
york
it
be
all
i
can
do
to
keep
from
getting
the
swell
head
and
bragging
about
it
i
enjoyed
myself
down
to
the
ground
every
minute
i
not
the
kind
of
fellow
to
be
likely
to
be
able
to
pay
you
back
your
kindness
but
hully
gee
if
i
could
i
do
it
to
beat
the
band
gentlemen
and
thank
you
thank
across
which
one
of
their
minds
passed
the
thought
that
the
sound
of
the
hollow
impact
of
a
trotting
horse
hoofs
on
the
road
which
each
that
moment
became
conscious
of
hearing
was
the
sound
of
the
advancing
foot
of
fate
it
crossed
no
mind
among
the
three
there
was
no
reason
why
it
should
and
yet
at
that
moment
the
meaning
of
the
regular
stirring
sound
was
a
fateful
thing
someone
on
horseback
said
penzance
he
had
scarcely
spoken
before
round
the
curve
of
the
road
she
came
a
finely
slender
and
spiritedly
erect
girl
figure
upon
a
bright
chestnut
with
a
thoroughbred
gait
a
smart
groom
riding
behind
her
she
came
towards
them
was
abreast
them
looked
at
mount
dunstan
a
smiling
dimple
near
her
lip
as
she
returned
his
quick
salute
miss
vanderpoel
he
said
low
to
the
vicar
lady
anstruther
penzance
replacing
his
own
hat
looked
after
her
with
surprised
pleasure
really
he
exclaimed
miss
vanderpoel
what
a
fine
girl
how
unusually
handsome
selden
turned
with
a
gasp
of
delighted
amazed
recognition
miss
vanderpoel
he
burst
forth
reuben
vanderpoel
daughter
the
one
that
over
here
visiting
her
sister
is
it
that
one
sure
yes
from
mount
dunstan
without
fervour
lady
anstruthers
lives
at
stornham
about
six
miles
from
gee
with
feverish
regret
if
her
father
was
there
and
i
could
get
next

the

of
stornham
the
chestnut
was
one
of
the
new
horses
now
standing
in
the
stornham
stables
there
were
several
of
them
a

for
the

for

or

a

for

the

necessary
at
such
a
place
at

the
stables
themselves
had
been
quickly
put
in
order
grooms
and
stable
boys
kept
them
as
they
had
not
been
kept
for
years
the
men
learned
in
a
time
that
their
work
could
not
be
done
too
well
there
were
new
carriages
as
well
as
horses
they
had
come
from
london
after
lady
anstruthers
and
her
sister
returned
from
town
the
horses
had
been
brought
down
by
their
grooms
immensely
looked
after
blanketed
hooded
and
altogether
cared
for
as
if
they
were
visiting
dukes
and
duchesses
they
were
all
fine
handsome
carefully
chosen
creatures
when
they
danced
and
sidled
through
the
village
on
their
way
to
the
court
they
created
a
sensation
whosoever
had
chosen
them
had
known
his
business
the
older
vehicles
had
been
repaired
in
the
village
by
tread
and
did
him
credit
fox
had
also
done
his
work
well
plenty
more
of
it
had
come
into
their
tools
to
be
used
on
the
estate
garden
implements
wheelbarrows
lawn
rollers
things
needed
about
the
house
stables
and
cottages
were
to
be
attended
to
the
church
roof
was
being
repaired
taking
all
these
things
and
the
doing
up
of
the
court
itself
there
was
more
work
than
the
village
could
manage
and
carpenters
bricklayers
and
decorators
were
necessarily
brought
from
other
places
still
joe
buttle
and
sim
soames
were
allowed
to
lead
in
all
such
things
as
lay
within
their
capabilities
it
was
they
who
made
such
a
splendid
job
of
the
entrance
gates
and
the
lodges
it
was
astonishing
how
much
was
done
and
how
the
sense
of
life
in
the
air
the
work
of
resulting
prosperity
made
men
begin
to
tread
with
less
listless
steps
as
they
went
to
and
from
their
labour
in
the
cottages
things
were
being
done
which
made
downcast
women
bestir
themselves
and
look
less
slatternly
leaks
mended
here
windows
there
the
hopeless
copper
in
the
tiny
washhouse
replaced
by
a
new
one
chimneys
cured
of
the
habit
of
smoking
a
clean
flowered
paper
put
on
a
wall
a
coat
of
whitewash
they
were
small
matters
but
produced
great
effect
betty
had
begun
to
drop
into
the
cottages
and
make
the
acquaintance
of
their
owners
her
first
visits
she
observed
created
great
consternation
women
looked
frightened
or
sullen
children
stared
and
refused
to
speak
clinging
to
skirts
and
aprons
she
found
the
atmosphere
clear
after
her
second
visit
the
women
began
to
talk
and
the
children
collected
in
groups
and
listened
with
cheerful
grins
she
could
pick
up
little
jane
kitten
or
give
a
pat
to
small
mongrel
dog
in
a
manner
which
threw
down
barriers
do
put
out
your
pipe
she
said
to
old
grandfather
doby
rising
totteringly
respectful
from
his
chair
you
have
only
just
lighted
it
you
must
waste
a
whole
pipeful
of
tobacco
because
i
have
come
the
old
man
grown
childish
with
age
tittered
and
shuffled
and
giggled
such
a
joke
as
the
grand
young
lady
was
having
with
him
she
saw
he
had
only
just
lighted
his
pipe
the
gentry
joked
a
bit
sometimes
but
he
was
afraid
of
his
grandson
wife
who
was
frowning
and
shaking
her
head
betty
went
to
him
and
put
her
hand
on
his
arm
sit
down
she
said
and
i
will
sit
by
and
she
sat
down
and
showed
him
that
she
had
brought
a
package
of
tobacco
with
her
and
actually
a
wonder
of
a
red
and
yellow
jar
to
hold
it
at
the
sight
of
which
joys
his
rapture
was
so
great
that
his
trembling
hands
could
scarcely
clasp
his
treasures
deary
me
thankee
thankee
my
lady
he
tittered
and
he
gazed
and
blinked
at
her
beauty
through
heavenly
tears
nearly
a
hundred
years
old
and
he
has
lived
on
sixteen
shillings
a
week
all
his
life
and
earned
it
by
working
every
hour
between
sunrise
and
sunset
betty
said
to
her
sister
when
she
went
home
a
man
has
one
life
and
his
has
passed
like
that
it
is
done
now
and
all
the
years
and
work
have
left
nothing
in
his
old
hands
but
his
pipe
all
i
should
not
like
to
put
it
out
for
him
who
am
i
that
i
can
buy
him
a
new
one
and
keep
it
filled
for
him
until
the
end
how
did
it
happen
no
suddenly
i
must
not
lose
time
in
asking
myself
that
i
must
get
the
new
she
did
it
a
pipe
of
great
magnificence
such
as
drew
to
the
doby
cottage
as
many
callers
as
the
village
could
provide
each
coming
with
fevered
interest
to
look
at
it
to
be
allowed
to
hold
and
examine
it
for
a
few
moments
guessing
at
its
probable
enormous
cost
and
returning
it
reverently
to
gaze
at
doby
with
respect
the
increase
of
which
can
be
imagined
when
it
was
known
that
he
was
not
only
possessor
of
the
pipe
but
of
an
assurance
that
he
would
be
supplied
with
as
much
tobacco
as
he
could
use
to
the
end
of
his
days
from
the
time
of
the
advent
of
the
pipe
grandfather
doby
became
a
man
of
mark
and
his
life
in
the
chimney
corner
a
changed
thing
a
man
who
owns
splendours
and
unlimited
excellent
shag
may
like
friends
to
drop
in
and
crack
jokes
and
even
smoke
a
pipe
with
him
a
common
pipe
which
however
is
not
amiss
when
excellent
shag
comes
free
he
lives
in
a
wild
whirl
of
gaiety
a
social
vortex
said
betty
to
lady
anstruthers
after
one
of
her
visits
he
is
actually
rejuvenated
i
must
order
some
new
white
smocks
for
him
to
receive
his
visitors
in
someone
brought
him
an
old
copy
of
the
illustrated
london
news
last
night
we
will
send
him
illustrated
papers
every
in
the
dull
old
brain
god
knows
what
spark
of
life
had
been
relighted
young
doby
related
with
chuckles
that
granddad
had
begged
that
his
chair
might
be
dragged
to
the
window
that
he
might
sit
and
watch
the
village
street
sitting
there
day
after
day
he
smoked
and
looked
at
his
pictures
and
dozed
and
dreamed
his
pipe
and
tobacco
jar
beside
him
on
the
window
ledge
at
any
sound
of
wheels
or
footsteps
his
face
lighted
and
if
by
chance
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
betty
he
tottered
to
his
feet
and
stood
hurriedly
touching
his
bald
forehead
with
a
reverent
palsied
hand
is
he
would
say
enrapt
i
seen
i
and
young
doby
knew
that
this
was
his
joy
and
what
he
waited
for
as
one
waits
for
the
coming
of
the
sun
is
is
the
vicar
wife
brent
who
since
the
affair
of
john
wilson
fire
had
dropped
into
the
background
and
felt
it
indiscreet
to
present
tales
of
distress
at
the
court
began
to
recover
her
courage
her
perfunctory
visits
assumed
a
new
character
the
vicarage
had
of
course
called
promptly
upon
miss
vanderpoel
after
her
arrival
brent
admired
miss
vanderpoel
hugely
you
seem
so
unlike
an
american
she
said
once
in
her
most
tactful
ingratiating
manner
which
was
very
ingratiating
indeed
do
i
what
is
one
like
when
one
is
like
an
american
i
am
one
you
i
can
scarcely
believe
it
with
sweet
ardour
pray
try
said
betty
with
simple
brevity
and
brent
felt
that
perhaps
miss
vanderpoel
was
not
really
very
easy
to
get
on
with
she
meant
to
imply
that
i
did
not
speak
through
my
nose
and
talk
too
much
and
too
vivaciously
in
a
shrill
voice
betty
said
afterwards
in
talking
the
interview
over
with
rosy
i
like
to
convince
myself
that
is
not
one
sole
national
characteristic
also
it
was
not
exactly
brent
place
to
kindly
encourage
me
with
the
information
that
i
do
not
seem
to
belong
to
my
own
lady
anstruthers
laughed
and
betty
looked
at
her
inquiringly
you
said
that
just
like
just
like
an
did
i
said
betty
brent
had
come
to
talk
to
her
because
she
did
not
wish
to
trouble
dear
lady
anstruthers
lady
anstruthers
already
looked
much
stronger
but
she
had
been
delicate
so
long
that
one
hesitated
to
distress
her
with
village
matters
she
did
not
add
that
she
realised
that
she
was
coming
to
headquarters
the
vicar
and
herself
were
much
disturbed
about
a
rather
tiresome
old
woman
old
welden
who
lived
in
a
tiny
cottage
in
the
village
she
was
years
old
and
a
respectable
old
person
a
widow
who
had
reared
ten
children
the
children
had
all
grown
up
and
scattered
and
old
welden
had
nothing
whatever
to
live
on
no
one
knew
how
she
lived
and
really
she
would
be
better
off
in
the
workhouse
she
could
be
sent
to
brexley
union
and
comfortably
taken
care
of
but
she
had
that
singular
obstinate
dislike
to
going
which
it
was
so
difficult
to
manage
she
had
asked
for
a
shilling
a
week
from
the
parish
but
that
could
not
be
allowed
her
as
it
would
merely
uphold
her
in
her
obstinate
intention
of
remaining
in
her
cottage
and
taking
care
of
herself
which
she
could
not
do
betty
gathered
that
the
shilling
a
week
would
be
a
drain
on
the
parish
funds
and
would
so
raise
the
old
creature
to
affluence
that
she
would
feel
she
could
defy
fate
and
the
contumacity
of
old
men
and
women
should
not
be
strengthened
by
the
reckless
bestowal
of
shillings
knowing
that
miss
vanderpoel
had
already
gained
influence
among
the
village
people
brent
said
she
had
come
to
ask
her
if
she
would
see
old
welden
and
argue
with
her
in
such
a
manner
as
would
convince
her
that
the
workhouse
was
the
best
place
for
her
it
was
of
course
so
much
pleasanter
if
these
old
people
could
be
induced
to
go
to
brexley
willingly
shall
i
be
undermining
the
whole
political
economy
of
stornham
if
i
take
care
of
her
myself
suggested
betty
you
you
will
lead
others
to
expect
the
same
thing
will
be
done
for
when
one
has
resources
to
draw
on
miss
vanderpoel
commented
in
the
case
of
a
woman
who
has
lived
years
and
brought
up
ten
children
until
they
were
old
and
strong
enough
to
leave
her
to
take
care
of
herself
it
is
difficult
for
the
weak
of
mind
to
apply
the
laws
of
political
economics
i
will
go
and
see
old
if
the
vanderpoels
would
provide
for
all
the
obstinate
old
men
and
women
in
the
parish
the
political
economics
of
stornham
would
proffer
no
marked
objections
a
good
many
americans
brent
reflected
seemed
to
have
those
odd
lavish
ways
as
witness
lady
anstruthers
herself
on
her
first
introduction
to
village
life
miss
vanderpoel
was
evidently
a
much
stronger
character
and
extremely
clever
and
somehow
the
stream
of
the
american
fortune
was
at
last
being
directed
towards
stornham
which
of
course
should
have
happened
long
ago
a
good
deal
was
being
done
and
the
whole
situation
looked
more
promising
so
was
the
matter
discussed
and
summed
up
the
same
evening
after
dinner
at
the
vicarage
betty
found
old
welden
cottage
it
was
in
a
green
lane
turning
from
the
village
street
which
was
almost
a
green
lane
itself
a
tiny
front
garden
was
before
the
cottage
door
a
wicket
gate
was
in
the
hedge
and
a
fuschia
bush
and
a
few
old
roses
were
in
the
few
yards
of
garden
there
were
actually
two
or
three
geraniums
in
the
window
showing
cheerful
scarlet
between
the
short
white
dimity
curtains
a
house
this
size
and
of
this
poverty
in
an
american
village
was
betty
thought
would
be
a
bare
and
straggling
hideousness
with
old
tomato
cans
in
the
front
yard
here
is
one
of
the
things
we
have
to
learn
from
when
she
knocked
at
the
door
an
old
woman
opened
it
she
was
a
and
markedly
respectable
old
person
in
a
decent
print
frock
and
a
cap
at
the
sight
of
her
visitor
she
beamed
and
made
a
suggestion
of
curtsey
how
do
you
do
welden
said
betty
i
am
lady
sister
miss
vanderpoel
i
thought
i
would
like
to
come
and
see
thank
you
miss
i
am
obliged
for
the
kindness
miss
wo
you
come
in
and
have
a
chair
there
were
no
signs
of
decrepitude
about
her
and
she
had
a
cheery
old
eye
the
tiny
front
room
was
neat
though
there
was
scarcely
space
enough
in
it
to
contain
the
table
covered
with
its
cotton
cloth
the
narrow
sofa
and
two
or
three
chairs
there
were
a
few
small
coloured
prints
and
a
framed
photograph
or
so
on
the
walls
and
on
the
table
was
a
bible
and
a
brown
earthenware
teapot
and
a
plate
tom
wood
wife
that
neighbour
next
door
to
me
she
said
gave
me
a
pinch
o
tea
an
i
just
been
it
tom
woods
miss
just
been
took
on
by
muster
kedgers
as
one
of
the
new
under
gardeners
at
the
betty
found
her
delightful
she
made
no
complaints
and
was
evidently
pleased
with
the
excitement
of
receiving
a
visitor
the
truth
was
that
in
common
with
every
other
old
woman
she
had
secretly
aspired
to
being
visited
some
day
by
the
amazing
young
lady
from
betty
had
yet
to
learn
of
the
heartburnings
which
may
be
occasioned
by
an
unconscious
favouritism
she
was
not
aware
that
when
she
dropped
in
to
talk
to
old
doby
his
neighbour
old
megworth
peered
from
behind
his
curtains
with
the
dew
of
envy
in
his
rheumy
eyes
he
mumbled
as
if
they
was
nobody
now
in
stornham
village
but
gaarge
doby
they
were
very
fierce
in
their
jealousy
of
attention
and
one
must
beware
of
rousing
evil
passions
in
the
octogenarian
breast
the
young
lady
from
meriker
had
not
so
far
had
time
to
make
a
call
at
any
cottage
in
old
welden
lane
and
she
had
knocked
just
at
old
welden
door
this
was
enough
to
put
in
good
spirits
even
a
less
cheery
old
person
at
first
betty
wondered
how
she
could
with
delicacy
ask
personal
questions
a
few
minutes
conversation
however
showed
her
that
the
personal
affairs
of
sir
nigel
tenants
were
also
the
affairs
of
not
only
himself
but
of
such
of
his
relatives
as
attended
to
their
natural
duty
her
presence
in
the
cottage
and
her
interest
in
ready
flow
of
simple
talk
were
desirable
and
proper
compliments
to
the
old
woman
herself
she
was
a
decent
and
old
person
but
in
her
mind
there
was
no
faintest
glimmer
of
resentment
of
questions
concerning
rent
and
food
and
the
needs
of
her
simple
existence
she
had
answered
such
questions
on
many
occasions
when
they
had
not
been
asked
in
the
manner
in
which
her
ladyship
sister
asked
them
brent
had
scolded
her
and
poked
about
her
cottage
going
into
her
tiny
wash
and
up
into
her
infinitesimal
bedroom
under
the
slanting
roof
to
see
that
they
were
kept
clean
miss
vanderpoel
showed
no
disposition
to
she
sat
and
listened
and
made
an
inquiry
here
and
there
in
a
nice
voice
and
with
a
smile
in
her
eyes
there
was
some
pleasure
in
relating
the
whole
history
of
your
years
to
a
young
lady
who
listened
as
if
she
wanted
to
hear
it
so
old
welden
prattled
on
about
her
good
days
when
she
was
young
and
was
kitchenmaid
at
the
parsonage
in
a
village
twenty
miles
away
about
her
marriage
with
a
young
farm
labourer
about
his
steady
habits
and
the
comfort
they
had
together
in
spite
of
the
yearly
arrival
of
a
new
baby
and
the
crowding
of
the
bit
of
a
cottage
his
master
allowed
them
ten
of
and
it
had
been
up
before
sunrise
and
a
good
bit
of
hard
work
to
keep
them
all
fed
and
but
she
had
not
minded
that
until
jack
died
quite
sudden
after
a
sunstroke
it
was
odd
how
much
colour
her
rustic
phraseology
held
she
made
betty
see
it
all
the
apparent
natural
inevitableness
of
their
being
turned
out
of
the
cottage
because
another
man
must
have
it
the
years
during
which
she
worked
her
way
while
the
ten
were
growing
up
having
measles
and
chicken
pox
and
scarlet
fever
one
dying
here
and
there
dropping
out
quite
in
the
natural
order
of
things
and
being
buried
by
the
parish
in
corners
of
the
ancient
church
yard
three
of
them
was
took
by
scarlet
fever
then
one
of
a
decline
then
one
or
two
by
other
illnesses
only
four
reached
man
and
womanhood
one
had
gone
to
australia
but
he
never
was
one
to
write
and
after
a
year
or
two
betty
gathered
he
had
seemed
to
melt
away
into
the
great
distance
two
girls
had
married
and
welden
could
not
say
they
had
been
they
could
barely
feed
themselves
and
their
swarms
of
children
the
other
son
had
never
been
steady
like
his
father
he
had
at
last
gone
to
london
and
london
had
swallowed
him
up
betty
was
struck
by
the
fact
that
she
did
not
seem
to
feel
that
the
mother
of
ten
might
have
expected
some
return
for
her
labours
at
her
unresentful
acceptance
of
things
was
at
once
significant
and
moving
betty
found
her
amazing
what
she
lived
on
it
was
not
easy
to
understand
she
seemed
rather
like
a
cheerful
old
bird
getting
up
each
morning
and
picking
up
her
sustenance
where
she
found
it
there
more
in
the
sayin
lord
pervides
than
a
good
many
thinks
she
said
with
a
small
chuckle
marked
more
by
a
genial
and
comfortable
sense
of
humour
than
by
an
air
of
meritoriously
quoting
the
vicar
he
she
paid
one
and
threepence
a
week
in
rent
for
her
cottage
and
this
was
the
most
serious
drain
upon
her
resources
she
apparently
could
live
without
food
or
fire
but
the
rent
must
be
paid
an
i
do
get
a
bit
sometimes
she
confessed
apologetically
an
then
it
a
trouble
to
get
her
cottage
was
one
of
a
short
row
and
she
did
odd
jobs
for
the
women
who
were
her
neighbours
there
were
always
babies
to
be
looked
after
and
bits
of
needed
sometimes
there
were
movings
from
one
cottage
to
another
and
confinements
were
plainly
at
once
exhilarating
and
enriching
her
temperamental
good
cheer
combined
with
her
experience
made
her
a
desirable
companion
and
assistant
she
was
engagingly
frank
when
they
new
to
it
an
a
bit
frightened
i
just
give
a
cup
of
tea
an
joke
with
to
cheer
up
she
said
i
says
to
charles
jenkins
wife
as
lives
next
door
now
me
girl
it
been
goin
on
since
adam
an
eve
an
there
a
good
many
of
us
left
there
an
a
fine
boy
it
was
too
miss
an
up
an
about
before
she
was
paid
in
sixpences
and
spare
shillings
and
in
cups
of
tea
or
a
loaf
or
screws
of
sugar
or
even
in
a
garment
not
yet
worn
beyond
repair
and
she
was
free
to
run
in
and
out
and
grow
a
flower
or
so
in
her
garden
and
talk
with
a
neighbour
over
the
low
dividing
hedge
they
want
me
to
go
into
the
reaching
the
dangerous
subject
at
last
they
say
i
be
took
care
of
an
looked
after
but
i
do
want
to
do
it
miss
i
want
to
keep
my
bit
of
a
if
i
can
an
be
free
to
come
an
go
i
an
it
wo
be
long
i
a
shilling
a
week
from
the
parish
but
they
stopped
it
because
they
said
i
ought
to
go
into
the
she
looked
at
betty
with
a
momentarily
anxious
smile
you
do
quite
understand
miss
she
said
it
seem
like
nothin
to
you
a
place
like
it
does
betty
answered
smiling
bravely
back
into
the
old
eyes
though
she
felt
a
slight
fulness
of
the
throat
i
understand
all
about
it
is
possible
that
old
welden
was
a
little
taken
aback
by
an
attitude
which
satisfactory
to
her
own
prejudices
though
it
might
be
was
taken
in
connection
with
fixed
customs
a
trifle
unnatural
you
do
mind
me
not
wantin
to
go
she
said
no
was
the
answer
not
at
betty
began
to
ask
questions
how
much
tea
sugar
soap
candles
bread
butter
bacon
could
welden
use
in
a
week
it
was
not
very
easy
to
find
out
the
exact
quantities
as
welden
estimates
of
such
things
had
been
based
during
her
entire
existence
upon
calculation
as
to
how
little
not
how
much
she
could
use
when
betty
suggested
a
pound
of
tea
a
half
pound
the
old
woman
smiled
at
the
innocent
ignorance
the
suggestion
of
such
reckless
profusion
implied
oh
no
bless
you
miss
no
i
could
never
do
away
with
it
a
quarter
miss
that
be
plenty
a
welden
idea
of
the
best
was
that
at
two
shillings
a
pound
quarter
of
a
pound
would
cost
sixpence
twelve
cents
thought
betty
a
pound
of
sugar
would
be
twopence
welden
would
use
half
a
pound
the
riotous
extravagance
of
two
cents
half
a
pound
of
butter
good
tub
butter
miss
would
be
ten
pence
three
farthings
a
pound
soap
candles
bacon
bread
coal
wood
in
the
quantities
required
by
welden
might
with
the
addition
of
rent
amount
to
the
dizzying
height
of
eight
or
ten
shillings
with
careful
extravagance
betty
mentally
summed
up
i
might
spend
almost
two
dollars
a
week
in
surrounding
her
with
a
riot
of
she
made
a
list
of
the
things
and
added
some
extras
as
an
idea
of
her
own
life
had
not
afforded
her
this
kind
of
thing
before
she
realised
she
felt
for
the
first
time
the
joy
of
reckless
extravagance
and
thrilled
with
the
excitement
of
it
you
need
not
think
of
brexley
union
any
more
she
said
when
she
having
risen
to
go
stood
at
the
cottage
door
with
old
welden
the
things
i
have
written
down
here
shall
be
sent
to
you
every
saturday
night
i
will
pay
your
miss
miss
welden
looked
affrighted
it
too
much
miss
coals
eighteen
pence
a
hundred
never
mind
said
her
ladyship
sister
and
the
old
woman
looking
up
into
her
eyes
found
there
the
colour
mount
dunstan
had
thought
of
as
being
that
of
bluebells
under
water
i
think
we
can
manage
it
welden
keep
yourself
as
warm
as
you
like
and
sometime
i
will
come
and
have
a
cup
of
tea
with
you
and
see
if
the
tea
is
oh
deary
me
said
welden
i
ca
think
what
to
say
miss
it
lifts
everythin
everythin
it
not
to
be
believed
it
like
left
a
when
the
wicket
gate
swung
to
and
the
young
lady
went
up
the
lane
the
old
woman
stood
staring
after
her
and
here
was
a
piece
of
news
to
run
into
charley
jenkins
cottage
and
tell
and
what
woman
or
man
in
the
row
would
quite
believe
it
chapter
xxv
we
began
to
marry
them
my
good
fellow
lord
dunholm
and
his
eldest
son
lord
westholt
sauntered
together
smoking
their
cigars
on
the
terrace
overlooking
park
and
gardens
which
seemed
to
sweep
without
boundary
line
into
the
purplish
land
beyond
the
grey
mass
of
the
castle
stood
against
the
blue
of
a
sky
whose
twilight
was
still
almost
daylight
though
in
the
purity
of
its
evening
stillness
a
star
already
hung
here
and
there
and
a
young
moon
swung
low
the
great
spaces
about
them
held
a
silence
whose
exquisite
entirety
was
marked
at
intervals
by
the
distant
bark
of
a
shepherd
dog
driving
his
master
sheep
to
the
fold
their
soft
intermittent
plaints
the
mother
ewes
mellow
answering
to
the
tender
fretful
lambs
floated
on
the
air
a
lovely
part
of
the
ending
day
repose
where
two
who
are
friends
stroll
together
at
such
hours
the
great
beauty
makes
for
silence
or
for
thoughtful
talk
these
two
men
father
and
son
were
friends
and
intimates
and
had
been
so
from
westholt
first
memory
of
the
time
when
his
childish
individuality
began
to
detach
itself
from
the
background
of
misty
and
indistinct
things
they
had
liked
each
other
and
their
liking
and
intimacy
had
increased
with
the
onward
moving
and
change
of
years
after
sixty
sane
and
decently
spent
active
years
of
life
lord
dunholm
in
either
country
tweed
or
evening
dress
was
a
and
handsome
man
at
his
son
was
still
like
him
have
you
seen
her
he
was
saying
only
at
a
distance
she
was
driving
lady
anstruthers
across
the
marshes
in
a
cart
she
drove
well
and
he
laughed
as
he
flicked
the
ash
from
his
cigar
the
back
of
her
head
and
shoulders
looked
the
american
young
woman
is
at
present
a
factor
which
is
without
doubt
to
be
counted
with
lord
dunholm
put
the
matter
without
lightness
any
young
woman
is
a
factor
but
the
american
young
woman
just
now
just
now
he
paused
a
moment
as
though
considering
it
did
not
seem
at
all
necessary
to
count
with
them
at
first
when
they
began
to
appear
among
us
they
were
generally
curiously
exotic
funny
little
creatures
with
odd
manners
and
voices
they
were
often
most
amusing
and
one
liked
to
hear
them
chatter
and
see
the
airy
lightness
with
which
they
took
superfluous
and
sometimes
unsuperfluous
conventions
as
a
hunter
takes
a
gate
but
it
never
occurred
to
us
to
marry
them
we
did
not
take
them
seriously
enough
but
we
began
to
marry
them
we
began
to
marry
them
my
good
fellow
the
final
words
broke
forth
with
such
a
suggestion
of
sudden
anxiety
that
in
spite
of
himself
westholt
laughed
involuntarily
and
his
father
turning
to
look
at
him
laughed
also
but
he
recovered
his
seriousness
it
was
all
rather
a
muddle
at
first
he
went
on
things
were
not
fairly
done
and
certain
bad
lots
looked
on
it
as
a
paying
scheme
on
the
one
side
while
it
was
a
matter
of
silly
little
ambitions
on
the
other
but
that
it
is
an
extraordinary
country
there
is
no
sane
denying
huge
fabulously
resourceful
in
every
way
area
variety
of
climate
wealth
of
minerals
products
of
all
sorts
soil
to
grow
anything
and
sun
and
rain
enough
to
give
each
thing
what
it
needs
last
or
rather
first
a
people
who
considered
as
a
nation
are
in
the
riot
of
youth
and
who
began
by
being
english
which
we
englishmen
have
an
innocent
belief
is
the
one
method
of
the
earth
that
figure
of
speech
is
an
americanism
i
carefully
committed
to
memory
well
after
all
look
at
the
map
look
at
the
map
there
we
they
had
frequently
discussed
together
the
question
of
the
development
of
international
relations
lord
dunholm
a
man
of
and
clear
logic
had
realised
that
the
oddly
unaccentuated
growth
of
intercourse
between
the
two
countries
might
be
a
subject
to
be
reflected
on
without
lightness
the
habit
we
have
of
regarding
america
and
americans
as
rather
a
joke
he
had
once
said
has
a
sort
of
parallel
in
the
condescendingly
amiable
amusement
of
a
parent
at
the
precocity
or
whimsicalness
of
a
child
but
the
child
is
shooting
up
amazingly
amazingly
in
a
way
which
suggests
divers
the
exchange
of
visits
between
dunholm
and
stornham
had
been
rare
and
formal
from
the
call
made
upon
the
younger
lady
anstruthers
on
her
marriage
the
dunholms
had
returned
with
a
sense
of
puzzled
pity
for
the
little
american
bride
with
her
wonderful
frock
and
her
uneasy
childish
eyes
for
some
years
lady
anstruthers
had
been
too
delicate
to
make
or
return
calls
one
heard
painful
accounts
of
her
apparent
wretched
and
of
the
condition
of
her
husband
estate
as
the
relations
between
the
two
families
have
evidently
been
strained
for
years
lord
dunholm
said
it
is
interesting
to
hear
of
the
sudden
advent
of
the
sister
it
seems
to
point
to
reconciliation
and
you
say
the
girl
is
an
unusual
person
from
what
one
hears
she
would
be
unusual
if
she
were
an
english
girl
who
had
spent
her
life
on
an
english
estate
that
an
american
who
is
making
her
first
visit
to
england
should
seem
to
see
at
once
the
practical
needs
of
a
neglected
place
is
a
thing
to
wonder
at
what
can
she
know
about
it
one
thinks
but
she
apparently
does
know
they
say
she
has
made
no
mistakes
even
with
the
village
people
she
is
managing
in
one
way
or
another
to
give
work
to
every
man
who
wants
it
result
of
course
unbounded
rustic
lord
dunholm
laughed
between
the
soothing
whiffs
of
his
cigar
how
clever
of
her
and
what
sensible
good
feeling
yes
yes
she
evidently
has
learned
things
somewhere
perhaps
new
york
has
found
it
wise
to
begin
to
give
young
women
professional
training
in
the
management
of
english
estates
who
knows
not
a
bad
it
was
the
rustic
enthusiasm
westholt
explained
which
had
in
a
manner
spread
her
fame
one
heard
enlightening
and
illustrative
anecdotes
of
her
he
related
several
well
worth
hearing
she
had
evidently
a
sense
of
humour
and
unexpected
perceptions
one
detail
of
the
story
of
old
doby
meerschaum
westholt
said
pleased
me
enormously
she
managed
to
convey
to
him
without
hurting
his
aged
feelings
or
overwhelming
him
with
embarrassment
that
if
he
preferred
a
clean
churchwarden
or
his
old
briarwood
he
need
not
feel
obliged
to
smoke
the
new
pipe
he
could
regard
it
as
a
trophy
now
how
did
she
do
that
without
filling
him
with
fright
and
confusion
lest
she
might
think
him
not
sufficiently
grateful
for
her
present
but
they
tell
me
she
did
it
and
that
old
doby
is
rapturously
happy
and
takes
the
meerschaum
to
bed
with
him
but
only
smokes
it
on
sundays
sitting
at
his
window
blowing
great
clouds
when
his
neighbours
are
coming
from
church
it
was
a
clever
girl
who
knew
that
an
old
fellow
might
secretly
like
his
old
pipe
it
was
a
deliciously
clever
girl
said
lord
dunholm
one
wants
to
know
and
make
friends
with
her
we
must
drive
over
and
call
i
confess
i
rather
congratulate
myself
that
anstruthers
is
not
at
so
do
i
westholt
answered
one
wonders
a
little
how
far
he
and
his
will
when
he
returns
he
an
unpleasant
a
few
days
later
brent
returning
from
a
call
on
charley
jenkins
was
passed
by
a
carriage
whose
liveries
she
recognised
half
way
up
the
village
street
it
was
the
carriage
from
dunholm
castle
lord
and
lady
dunholm
and
lord
westholt
sat
in
it
they
were
of
course
going
to
call
at
the
court
miss
vanderpoel
was
beginning
to
draw
people
she
naturally
would
she
would
be
likely
to
make
quite
a
difference
in
the
neighbourhood
now
that
it
had
heard
of
her
and
lady
anstruthers
had
been
seen
driving
with
her
evidently
no
longer
an
unvisitable
invalid
but
actually
decently
clothed
and
in
her
right
mind
brent
slackened
her
steps
that
she
might
have
the
pleasure
of
receiving
and
responding
gracefully
to
salutations
from
the
important
personages
in
the
landau
she
felt
that
the
dunholms
were
important
there
were
earldoms
and
earldoms
and
that
of
dunholm
was
dignified
and
of
distinction
a
young
man
on
a
bicycle
who
had
wheeled
into
the
village
with
the
carriage
riding
alongside
it
for
a
hundred
yards
or
so
stopped
before
the
clock
inn
and
dismounted
just
as
brent
neared
him
he
saw
her
looking
after
the
equipage
and
lifting
his
cap
spoke
to
her
civilly
this
is
stornham
village
ai
it
he
inquired
yes
my
his
costume
and
general
aspect
seemed
to
indicate
that
he
was
of
the
class
one
addressed
as
my
man
though
there
was
something
a
little
odd
about
him
thank
you
that
was
miss
vanderpoel
eldest
sister
in
that
carriage
was
it
miss
vanderpoel
brent
hesitated
do
you
mean
lady
anstruthers
i
forgotten
her
name
i
know
miss
vanderpoel
eldest
sister
lives
at
stornham
reuben
vanderpoel
lady
anstruthers
younger
sister
is
a
miss
vanderpoel
and
she
is
visiting
at
stornham
court
brent
could
not
help
adding
curiously
why
do
you
ask
i
am
going
to
see
her
i
an
brent
coughed
to
cover
a
slight
gasp
she
had
heard
remarkable
things
of
the
democratic
customs
of
america
it
was
painful
not
to
be
able
to
ask
questions
the
lady
in
the
carriage
was
the
countess
of
dunholm
she
said
rather
grandly
they
are
going
to
the
court
to
call
on
miss
then
miss
vanderpoel
there
yet
that
all
right
thank
you
and
lifting
his
cap
again
he
turned
into
the
little
public
house
the
dunholm
party
had
been
accustomed
on
their
rare
visits
to
stornham
to
be
received
by
the
kind
of
in
the
kind
of
livery
which
is
a
manifest
though
unwilling
confession
the
men
who
threw
open
the
doors
were
of
regulation
height
well
dressed
and
of
trained
bearing
the
entrance
hall
had
lost
its
hopeless
shabbiness
it
was
a
complete
and
picturesquely
luxurious
thing
the
change
suggested
magic
the
magic
which
had
been
used
lord
dunholm
reflected
was
the
simplest
and
most
powerful
on
earth
given
surroundings
combined
with
a
gift
for
knowing
values
of
form
and
colour
if
you
have
the
power
to
spend
thousands
of
guineas
on
tiger
skins
oriental
rugs
and
other
beauties
barrenness
is
easily
transformed
the
wore
a
changed
aspect
and
at
a
first
glance
it
was
to
be
seen
that
in
poor
little
lady
anstruthers
as
she
had
generally
been
called
there
was
to
be
noted
alteration
also
in
her
case
the
change
being
in
its
first
stages
could
not
perhaps
be
yet
called
transformation
but
aided
by
softly
pretty
arrangement
of
dress
and
hair
a
light
in
her
eyes
and
a
suggestion
of
pink
under
her
skin
one
recalled
that
she
had
once
been
a
pretty
little
woman
and
that
after
all
she
was
only
about
years
old
that
her
sister
miss
vanderpoel
had
beauty
it
was
not
necessary
to
hesitate
in
deciding
neither
lord
dunholm
nor
his
wife
nor
their
son
did
hesitate
a
girl
with
long
limbs
an
alluring
profile
and
extraordinary
black
lashes
set
round
lovely
eyes
possesses
physical
capital
not
to
be
argued
about
she
was
not
one
of
the
curious
exotic
little
creatures
whose
thin
though
sometimes
rather
sweet
and
always
gay
young
voices
lord
dunholm
had
been
so
especially
struck
by
in
the
early
days
of
the
american
invasion
her
voice
had
a
tone
one
would
be
likely
to
remember
with
pleasure
how
well
she
moved
how
well
her
black
head
was
set
on
her
neck
yes
she
was
of
the
new
type
the
later
generation
these
amazing
oddly
practical
people
had
evolved
it
planned
it
perhaps
bought
figuratively
speaking
the
architects
and
material
to
design
and
build
it
bought
them
in
whatever
country
they
found
them
england
france
italy
germany
pocketing
them
coolly
and
carrying
them
back
home
to
develop
complete
and
send
forth
into
the
world
when
their
invention
was
a
perfected
thing
struck
by
the
humour
of
his
fancy
lord
dunholm
found
himself
smiling
into
the
eyes
they
smiled
back
at
him
in
a
way
which
warmed
his
heart
there
were
no
pauses
in
the
conversation
which
followed
in
times
past
calls
at
stornham
had
generally
held
painfully
blank
moments
lady
dunholm
was
as
pleased
as
her
husband
a
really
charming
girl
was
an
enormous
acquisition
to
the
neighbourhood
westholt
his
father
saw
had
found
even
more
than
the
story
of
old
doby
pipe
had
prepared
him
to
expect
country
calls
were
not
usually
interesting
or
stimulating
and
this
one
was
lord
dunholm
laid
subtly
brilliant
plans
to
lead
miss
vanderpoel
to
talk
of
her
native
land
and
her
views
of
it
he
knew
that
she
would
say
things
worth
hearing
incidentally
one
gathered
picturesque
detail
to
have
vibrated
between
the
two
continents
since
her
thirteenth
year
to
have
spent
a
few
years
at
school
in
one
country
a
few
years
in
another
and
yet
a
few
years
more
in
still
another
as
part
of
an
arranged
educational
plan
to
have
crossed
the
atlantic
for
the
holidays
and
to
have
journeyed
thousands
of
miles
with
her
father
in
his
private
car
to
make
the
visits
of
a
man
of
great
schemes
to
his
possessions
of
mines
railroads
and
lands
which
were
almost
principalities
these
things
had
been
merely
details
of
her
life
adding
interest
and
variety
it
was
true
but
seeming
the
merely
normal
outcome
of
existence
they
were
normal
to
vanderpoels
and
others
of
their
class
who
were
abnormalities
in
themselves
when
compared
with
the
rest
of
the
world
her
own
very
lack
of
any
abnormality
reached
in
lord
dunholm
mind
the
highest
point
of
illustration
of
the
phase
of
life
she
beautifully
represented
for
beautiful
he
felt
its
rare
charms
were
when
they
strolled
out
to
look
at
the
gardens
he
found
talk
with
her
no
less
a
stimulating
thing
she
told
her
story
of
kedgers
and
showed
the
chosen
spot
where
thickets
of
lilies
were
to
bloom
with
the
giants
lifting
white
archangel
trumpets
above
them
in
the
centre
he
can
be
trusted
she
said
i
feel
sure
he
can
be
trusted
he
loves
them
he
could
not
love
them
so
much
and
not
be
able
to
take
care
of
and
as
she
looked
at
him
in
frank
appeal
for
sympathy
lord
dunholm
felt
that
for
the
moment
she
looked
like
a
tall
queenly
child
but
pleased
as
he
was
he
presently
gave
up
his
place
at
her
side
to
westholt
he
must
not
be
a
selfish
old
fellow
and
monopolise
her
he
hoped
they
would
see
each
other
often
he
said
charmingly
he
thought
she
would
be
sure
to
like
dunholm
which
was
really
a
thoroughly
english
old
place
marked
by
all
the
features
she
seemed
so
much
attracted
by
there
were
some
beautiful
relics
of
the
past
there
and
some
rather
shocking
ones
certain
dungeons
for
instance
and
a
gallows
mount
on
which
in
good
old
times
the
family
gallows
had
stood
this
had
apparently
been
a
working
adjunct
to
the
domestic
arrangements
of
every
respectable
family
and
that
irritating
persons
should
dangle
from
it
had
been
a
simple
domestic
necessity
if
one
were
to
believe
old
stories
it
was
then
that
nobles
were
regarded
with
respect
he
said
with
his
fine
smile
in
the
days
when
a
man
appeared
with
clang
of
arms
and
with
javelins
and
spears
before
and
donjon
keeps
in
the
background
the
attitude
of
bent
knees
and
awful
reverence
were
the
inevitable
results
when
one
could
hang
a
servant
on
one
own
private
gallows
or
chop
off
his
hand
for
irreverence
or
disobedience
obedience
and
reverence
were
a
rule
now
a
month
notice
is
the
extremity
of
punishment
and
the
old
pomp
of
armed
servitors
suggests
comic
opera
but
we
can
show
you
relics
of
it
at
he
joined
his
wife
and
began
at
once
to
make
himself
so
delightful
to
rosy
that
she
ceased
to
be
afraid
of
him
and
ended
by
talking
almost
gaily
of
her
london
visit
betty
and
westholt
walked
together
the
afternoon
being
lovely
they
had
all
sauntered
into
the
park
to
look
at
certain
views
and
the
sun
was
shining
between
the
trees
betty
thought
the
young
man
almost
as
charming
as
his
father
which
was
saying
much
she
had
fallen
wholly
in
love
with
lord
dunholm
with
his
handsome
elderly
face
his
voice
his
erect
bearing
his
fine
smile
his
attraction
of
manner
his
courteous
ease
and
wit
he
was
one
of
the
men
who
stood
for
the
best
of
all
they
had
been
born
to
represent
her
own
father
she
felt
stood
for
the
best
of
all
such
an
american
as
himself
should
be
lord
westholt
would
in
time
be
what
his
father
was
he
had
inherited
from
him
good
looks
good
feeling
and
a
sense
of
humour
yes
he
had
been
given
from
the
outset
all
that
the
other
man
had
been
denied
she
was
thinking
of
mount
dunstan
as
the
other
man
and
spoke
of
him
you
know
lord
mount
dunstan
she
said
westholt
hesitated
slightly
yes
and
no
he
answered
after
the
hesitation
no
one
knows
him
very
well
you
have
not
met
him
with
a
touch
of
surprise
in
his
tone
he
was
a
passenger
on
the
meridiana
when
i
last
crossed
the
atlantic
there
was
a
slight
accident
and
we
were
thrown
together
for
a
few
moments
afterwards
i
met
him
by
chance
again
i
did
not
know
who
he
lord
westholt
showed
signs
of
hesitation
anew
in
fact
he
was
rather
disturbed
she
evidently
did
not
know
anything
whatever
of
the
mount
dunstans
she
would
not
be
likely
to
hear
the
details
of
the
scandal
which
had
obliterated
them
as
it
were
from
the
decent
world
the
present
man
though
he
had
not
openly
been
mixed
up
with
the
hideous
thing
had
borne
the
brand
because
he
had
not
proved
himself
to
possess
any
qualities
likely
to
recommend
him
it
was
generally
understood
that
he
was
a
bad
lot
also
to
such
a
man
the
allurements
such
a
young
woman
as
miss
vanderpoel
would
present
would
be
extraordinary
it
was
unfortunate
that
she
should
have
been
thrown
in
his
way
at
the
same
time
it
was
not
possible
to
state
the
case
clearly
during
one
first
call
on
a
beautiful
stranger
his
going
to
america
was
rather
spirited
said
the
mellow
voice
beside
him
i
thought
only
americans
took
their
fates
in
their
hands
in
that
way
for
a
man
of
his
class
to
face
a
rancher
life
means
determination
it
means
the
spirit
with
a
low
little
laugh
at
the
leap
of
her
imagination
of
the
men
who
were
mount
dunstans
in
early
days
and
went
forth
to
fight
for
what
they
meant
to
have
he
went
to
fight
he
ought
to
have
won
he
will
win
some
i
do
not
know
about
fighting
lord
westholt
answered
had
the
fellow
been
telling
her
romantic
stories
the
general
impression
was
that
he
went
to
america
to
amuse
no
he
did
not
do
that
said
betty
with
simple
finality
a
sheep
ranch
is
not
amusing
she
stopped
short
and
stood
still
for
a
moment
they
had
been
walking
down
the
avenue
and
she
stopped
because
her
eyes
had
been
caught
by
a
figure
half
sitting
half
lying
in
the
middle
of
the
road
a
prostrate
bicycle
near
it
it
was
the
figure
of
a
cheaply
dressed
young
man
who
as
she
looked
seemed
to
make
an
ineffectual
effort
to
rise
is
that
man
ill
she
exclaimed
i
think
he
must
they
went
towards
him
at
once
and
when
they
reached
him
he
lifted
a
dazed
white
face
down
which
a
stream
of
blood
was
trickling
from
a
cut
on
his
forehead
he
was
in
fact
very
white
indeed
and
did
not
seem
to
know
what
he
was
doing
i
am
afraid
you
are
hurt
betty
said
and
as
she
spoke
the
rest
of
the
party
joined
them
the
young
man
vacantly
smiled
and
making
an
pass
across
his
face
with
his
hand
smeared
the
blood
over
his
features
painfully
betty
kneeled
down
and
drawing
out
her
handkerchief
lightly
wiped
the
gruesome
smears
away
lord
westholt
saw
what
had
happened
having
given
a
look
at
the
bicycle
his
chain
broke
as
he
was
coming
down
the
incline
and
as
he
fell
he
got
a
nasty
knock
on
this
stone
touching
with
his
foot
a
rather
large
one
which
had
evidently
fallen
from
some
cartload
of
building
material
the
young
man
still
vacantly
smiling
was
fumbling
at
his
breast
pocket
he
began
to
talk
incoherently
in
good
nasal
new
york
at
the
mere
sound
of
which
lady
anstruthers
made
a
little
yearning
step
forward
superior
any
other
he
muttered

no
equal
on
and
having
found
what
he
had
fumbled
for
he
handed
a
card
to
miss
vanderpoel
and
sank
unconscious
on
her
breast
let
me
support
him
miss
vanderpoel
said
westholt
starting
forward
never
mind
thank
you
said
betty
if
he
has
fainted
i
suppose
he
must
be
laid
flat
on
the
ground
will
you
please
to
read

it
was

had
read
the
day
before

said
westholt
travelling
in
the

of
his
firm
poor

the
clue
is
not
of
much
immediate
use
they
were
fortunately
not
far
from
the
house
and
westholt
went
back
quickly
to
summon
servants
and
send
for
the
village
doctor
the
dunholms
were
kindly
sympathetic
and
each
of
the
party
lent
a
handkerchief
to
staunch
the
bleeding
lord
dunholm
helped
miss
vanderpoel
to
lay
the
young
man
down
carefully
i
am
afraid
he
said
i
am
really
afraid
his
leg
is
broken
it
was
twisted
under
him
what
can
be
done
with
him
miss
vanderpoel
looked
at
her
sister
will
you
allow
him
to
be
carried
to
the
house
temporarily
rosy
she
asked
there
is
apparently
nothing
else
to
be
yes
yes
said
lady
anstruthers
how
could
one
send
him
away
poor
fellow
let
him
be
carried
to
the
miss
vanderpoel
smiled
into
lord
dunholm
much
approving
elderly
eyes
g
selden
is
a
compatriot
she
said
perhaps
he
heard
i
was
here
and
came
to
sell
me
a
lord
westholt
returning
with
two
footmen
and
a
light
mattress
selden
was
carried
with
cautious
care
to
the
house
the
afternoon
sun
breaking
through
the
branches
of
the
ancestral
oaks
kindly
touched
his
white
young
face
lord
dunholm
and
lord
westholt
each
lent
a
friendly
hand
and
miss
vanderpoel
keeping
near
once
or
twice
wiped
away
an
insistent
trickle
of
blood
which
showed
itself
from
beneath
the
handkerchiefs
lady
dunholm
followed
with
lady
anstruthers
afterwards
during
his
convalescence
selden
frequently
felt
with
regret
that
by
his
unconsciousness
of
the
dignity
of
his
cortege
at
the
moment
he
had
missed
feeling
himself
to
be
for
once
in
a
position
he
would
have
designated
as
out
of
sight
in
the
novelty
of
its
importance
to
have
beheld
him
borne
by
nobles
and
liveried
menials
accompanied
by
ladies
of
title
up
the
avenue
of
an
english
park
on
his
way
to
be
cared
for
in
baronial
halls
would
he
knew
have
added
a
joy
to
the
final
moments
of
his
grandmother
which
the
consolations
of
religion
could
scarcely
have
met
equally
in
competition
his
own
point
of
view
however
would
not
it
is
true
have
been
that
of
the
old
woman
in
the
black
net
cap
and
purple
ribbons
but
of
a
less
reverent
nature
his
enjoyment
in
fact
would
have
been
based
upon
that
transatlantic
sense
of
humour
whose
soul
is
glee
at
the
incompatible
which
would
have
been
full
fed
by
the
incongruity
of
little
willie
being
yanked
along
by
a
bunch
of
earls
and
reuben
vanderpoel
daughters
following
the
that
he
himself
should
have
been
unconscious
of
the
situation
seemed
to
him
like
throwing
away
the
doctor
arriving
after
he
had
been
put
to
bed
found
slight
concussion
of
the
brain
and
a
broken
leg
with
lady
anstruthers
kind
permission
it
would
certainly
be
best
that
he
should
remain
for
the
present
where
he
was
so
in
a
bedroom
whose
windows
looked
out
upon
spreading
lawns
and
trees
he
was
as
comfortably
established
as
was
possible
selden
through
the
capricious
intervention
of
fate
if
he
had
not
got
next
to
reuben
vanderpoel
himself
had
most
undisputably
got
next
to
his
favourite
daughter
as
the
dunholm
carriage
rolled
down
the
avenue
there
reigned
for
a
few
minutes
a
reflective
silence
it
was
lady
dunholm
who
broke
it
that
she
said
in
her
softly
decided
voice
that
is
a
nice
lord
dunholm
agreeable
humorous
smile
flickered
into
evidence
that
is
it
he
said
thank
you
eleanor
for
supplying
me
with
a
quite
delightful
early
victorian
word
i
believe
i
wanted
it
she
is
a
beauty
and
she
is
clever
she
is
a
number
of
other
things
but
she
is
also
a
nice
girl
if
you
will
allow
me
to
say
so
i
have
fallen
in
love
with

you
will
allow
me

what
it
must
be
to
you
just
you
selden
awakening
to
consciousness
two
days
later
lay
and
stared
at
the
chintz
covering
of
the
top
of
his
bed
through
a
few
minutes
of
vacant
amazement
it
was
a
bed
he
was
lying
on
was
it
and
his
leg
was
bandaged
and
felt
unmovable
the
last
thing
he
remembered
was
going
down
an
incline
in
a
avenue
there
was
nothing
more
he
had
been
all
right
then
was
this
a
bed
or
was
it
not
yes
it
was
and
was
it
part
of
the
furnishings
of
a
swell
bedroom
the
kind
of
bedroom
he
had
never
been
in
before
tip
top
in
fact
he
stared
and
tried
to
recall
things
but
could
not
and
in
his
bewilderment
exclaimed
aloud
well
he
said
if
this
ai
the
limit
you
may
search
me
a
respectable
person
in
a
white
apron
came
to
him
from
the
other
side
of
the
room
it
was
buttle
wife
who
had
been
hastily
called
in
sh
sh
she
said
soothingly
do
you
worry
nobody
ai
goin
to
search
you
nobody
ai
there
sh
sh
sh
rather
as
if
he
were
a
baby
beginning
to
be
conscious
of
a
curious
sense
of
weakness
selden
lay
and
stared
at
her
in
a
helplessness
which
might
have
been
considered
pathetic
perhaps
he
had
got
bats
in
his
belfry
and
there
was
no
use
in
talking
at
that
moment
however
the
door
opened
and
a
young
lady
entered
she
was
a
looker
selden
weakness
did
not
interfere
with
his
perceiving
a
looker
by
gee
she
was
dressed
as
if
for
going
out
in
softly
tinted
exquisite
things
and
a
large
strange
hydrangea
blue
flower
under
the
brim
of
her
hat
rested
on
soft
and
full
black
hair
the
black
hair
gave
him
a
clue
it
was
hair
like
that
he
had
seen
as
reuben
vanderpoel
daughter
rode
by
when
he
stood
at
the
park
gates
at
mount
dunstan
bats
in
his
belfry
of
course
how
is
he
she
said
to
the
nurse
he
been
seeming
comfortable
all
day
miss
the
woman
answered
but
he
yet
he
opened
his
eyes
quite
sensible
looking
a
bit
ago
but
he
spoke
queer
he
said
something
was
the
limit
and
that
we
might
search
betty
approached
the
bedside
to
look
at
him
and
meeting
the
disturbed
inquiry
in
his
uplifted
eyes
laughed
because
seeing
that
he
was
not
delirious
she
thought
she
understood
she
had
not
lived
in
new
york
without
hearing
its
argot
and
she
realised
that
the
exclamation
which
had
appeared
delirium
to
buttle
had
probably
indicated
that
the
unexplainableness
of
the
situation
in
which
selden
found
himself
struck
him
as
reaching
the
limit
of
probability
and
that
the
most
extended
search
of
his
person
would
fail
to
reveal
any
clue
to
satisfactory
explanation
she
bent
over
him
with
her
laugh
still
shining
in
her
eyes
i
hope
you
feel
better
can
you
tell
me
she
said
his
voice
was
not
strong
but
his
answer
was
that
of
a
young
man
who
knew
what
he
was
saying
if
i
not
off
my
head
i
quite
comfortable
thank
you
he
replied
i
am
glad
to
hear
that
said
betty
do
be
disturbed
your
mind
is
quite
all
i
want
said
selden
impartially
is
just
to
know
where
i
at
and
how
i
blew
in
here
it
would
help
me
to
rest
you
met
with
an
accident
the
looker
explained
still
smiling
with
both
lips
and
eyes
your
bicycle
chain
broke
and
you
were
thrown
and
hurt
yourself
it
happened
in
the
avenue
in
the
park
we
found
you
and
brought
you
in
you
are
at
stornham
court
which
belongs
to
sir
nigel
anstruthers
lady
anstruthers
is
my
sister
i
am
miss
hully
gee
ejaculated
selden
inevitably
hully
gee
the
splendour
of
the
moment
was
such
that
his
brain
whirled
as
it
was
not
yet
in
the
physical
condition
to
whirl
with
any
comfort
he
found
himself
closing
his
eyes
weakly
that
right
miss
vanderpoel
said
keep
them
closed
i
must
not
talk
to
you
until
you
are
stronger
lie
still
and
try
not
to
think
the
doctor
says
you
are
getting
on
very
well
i
will
come
and
see
you
as
the
soft
sweep
of
her
dress
reached
the
door
he
managed
to
open
his
eyes
thank
you
miss
vanderpoel
he
said
thank
you
and
as
his
eyelids
closed
again
he
murmured
in
luxurious
peace
well
if
her
she
can
have
me
and
welcome
she
came
to
see
him
again
each
day
sometimes
in
a
linen
frock
and
garden
hat
sometimes
in
her
soft
tints
and
lace
and
flowers
before
or
after
her
drive
in
the
afternoon
and
two
or
three
times
in
the
evening
with
lovely
shoulders
and
wonderfully
trailing
draperies
looking
like
the
women
he
had
caught
glimpses
of
on
the
rare
occasion
of
his
having
indulged
himself
in
the
highest
and
most
remotely
placed
seat
in
the
gallery
at
the
opera
which
inconvenience
he
had
borne
not
through
any
ardent
desire
to
hear
the
music
but
because
he
wanted
to
see
the
show
and
get
a
at
the
four
hundred
he
believed
very
implicitly
in
his
four
hundred
and
privately
though
perhaps
almost
unconsciously
cherished
the
distinction
his
share
of
them
conferred
upon
him
as
fondly
as
the
english
young
man
of
his
rudimentary
type
cherishes
his
dukes
and
duchesses
the
english
young
man
may
revel
in
his
coroneted
beauties
in
photograph
shops
the
young
american
dwells
fondly
on
flattering
or
very
unflattering
reproductions
of
his
wives
and
daughters
in
the
voluminous
illustrated
sheets
of
his
sunday
paper
without
which
life
would
be
a
wretched
and
savourless
thing
selden
had
never
seen
miss
vanderpoel
in
his
sunday
paper
and
here
he
was
lying
in
a
room
in
the
same
house
with
her
and
she
coming
in
to
see
him
and
talk
to
him
as
if
he
was
one
of
the
four
hundred
himself
the
comfort
and
luxury
with
which
he
found
himself
surrounded
sank
into
insignificance
when
compared
with
such
unearthly
luck
as
this
lady
anstruthers
came
in
to
see
him
also
and
she
several
times
brought
with
her
a
queer
little
lame
fellow
who
was
spoken
of
as
master
master
was
supposed
by
selden
to
be
a
sort
of
title
conferred
upon
the
small
sons
of
baronets
and
the
like
the
children
he
knew
in
new
york
and
elsewhere
answered
to
the
names
of
bob
or
jimmy
or
bill
no
parallel
to
master
had
been
in
vogue
among
them
lady
anstruthers
was
not
like
her
sister
she
was
a
little
thing
and
both
she
and
master
ughtred
seemed
fond
of
talking
of
new
york
she
had
not
been
home
for
years
and
the
youngster
had
never
seen
it
at
all
he
had
some
queer
ideas
about
america
and
seemed
never
to
have
seen
anything
but
stornham
and
the
village
selden
liked
him
and
was
vaguely
sorry
for
a
little
chap
to
whom
a
description
of
the
festivities
attendant
upon
the
fourth
of
july
and
a
presidential
election
seemed
like
stories
from
the
arabian
nights
tell
me
about
the
tammany
tiger
if
you
please
he
said
once
i
want
to
know
what
kind
of
an
animal
it
from
a
point
of
view
somewhat
different
from
that
of
mount
dunstan
and
penzance
betty
vanderpoel
found
talk
with
him
interesting
to
her
he
did
not
wear
the
aspect
of
a
foreign
product
she
had
not
met
and
conversed
with
young
men
like
him
but
she
knew
of
them
stringent
precautions
were
taken
to
protect
her
father
from
their
ingenuous
enterprises
they
were
not
permitted
to
enter
his
offices
they
were
even
discouraged
from
hovering
about
their
neighbourhood
when
seen
and
suspected
the
atmosphere
it
was
understood
was
to
be
if
possible
disinfected
of
agents
this
one
lying
softly
in
the
bed
cheerfully
grateful
for
the
kindness
shown
him
and
plainly
filled
with
delight
in
his
adventure
despite
the
physical
discomforts
attending
it
gave
her
as
he
began
to
recover
new
views
of
the
life
he
lived
in
common
with
his
kind
it
was
like
reading
scenes
from
a
realistic
novel
of
new
york
life
to
listen
to
his
frank
slangy
conversation
to
her
as
well
as
to
penzance
sidelights
were
thrown
upon
existence
in
the
hall
bedroom
and
upon
previously
unknown
phases
of
business
life
in
broadway
and
roaring
downtown
streets
his
determination
his
sharp
readiness
his
control
of
temper
under
rebuff
and
superfluous
harshness
his
odd
impersonal
summing
up
of
men
and
things
and
patience
with
the
world
in
general
were
she
knew
business
assets
she
was
even
moved
no
less
by
the
remote
connection
of
such
a
life
with
that
of
the
first
reuben
vanderpoel
who
had
laid
the
huge
solid
foundations
of
their
modern
fortune
the
first
reuben
vanderpoel
must
have
seen
and
known
the
faces
of
men
as
selden
saw
and
knew
them
fighting
his
way
step
by
step
knocking
pertinaciously
at
every
gateway
which
might
give
ingress
to
some
passage
leading
to
even
the
smallest
gain
meeting
with
rebuff
and
indifference
only
to
be
overcome
by
steady
and
continued
assault
if
selden
was
a
nuisance
the
first
vanderpoel
had
without
doubt
worn
that
aspect
upon
innumerable
occasions
no
one
desires
the
presence
of
the
man
who
while
having
nothing
to
give
must
persist
in
keeping
himself
in
evidence
even
if
by
strategy
or
force
from
stories
she
was
familiar
with
she
had
gathered
that
the
first
reuben
vanderpoel
had
certainly
lacked
a
certain
youth
of
soul
she
felt
in
this
modern
struggler
for
life
he
had
been
the
cleverer
man
of
the
two
selden
she
secretly
liked
the
better
the
curiosity
of
buttle
who
was
the
nurse
had
been
awakened
by
a
singular
feature
of
her
patient
feverish
wanderings
he
keeps
muttering
miss
things
i
ca
make
out
about
lord
mount
dunstan
and
penzance
and
some
child
he
calls
little
willie
he
talks
to
them
the
same
as
if
he
knew
them
same
as
if
he
was
with
them
and
they
were
talking
to
him
quite
one
morning
betty
coming
to
make
her
visit
of
inquiry
found
the
patient
looking
thoughtful
and
when
she
commented
upon
his
air
of
pondering
his
reply
cast
light
upon
the
mystery
well
miss
vanderpoel
he
explained
i
was
lying
here
thinking
of
lord
mount
dunstan
and
penzance
and
how
well
they
treated
me
i
have
told
you
about
that
have
i
that
explains
what
buttle
said
she
answered
when
you
were
delirious
you
talked
frequently
to
lord
mount
dunstan
and
penzance
we
both
wondered
then
he
told
her
the
whole
story
beginning
with
his
sitting
on
the
grassy
bank
outside
the
park
listening
to
the
song
of
the
robin
he
ended
with
the
adieux
at
the
entrance
gates
when
the
sound
of
her
horse
trotting
hoofs
had
been
heard
by
each
of
them
what
i
been
lying
here
thinking
of
he
said
is
how
queer
it
was
it
happened
just
that
way
if
i
had
stopped
just
that
minute
and
if
you
had
gone
by
and
if
lord
mount
dunstan
had
known
you
and
said
who
you
were
little
willie
would
have
been
in
london
by
this
time
hustling
to
get
a
cheap
bunk
back
to
new
york
because
inquired
miss
vanderpoel
selden
laughed
and
hesitated
a
moment
then
he
made
a
clean
breast
of
it
say
miss
vanderpoel
he
said
i
hope
it
wo
make
you
mad
if
i
own
up
ladies
like
you
do
know
anything
about
chaps
like
me
on
the
square
and
straight
out
when
i
seen
you
and
heard
your
name
i
help
remembering
whose
daughter
you
was
reuben
vanderpoel
spells
a
big
thing
why
when
i
was
in
new
york
we
fellows
used
to
get
together
and
talk
about
what
it
mean
to
the
chap
who
could
get
next
to
reuben
vanderpoel
we
used
to
count
up
all
the
business
he
does
and
all
the
clerks
he
got
under
him
pounding
away
on
typewriters
and
how
be
bound
to
get
worn
out
and
need
new
ones
and
we
make
calculations
how
many
a
man
could
unload
if
he
could
get
next
it
was
a
kind
of
typewriting
junior
assistant
fairy
story
and
we
knew
it
could
happen
really
but
we
used
to
chin
about
it
just
for
the
fun
of
the
thing
one
of
the
boys
made
up
a
thing
about
one
of
us
saving
reuben
life
dragging
him
from
under
a
runaway
auto
and
when
he
says
can
i
do
to
show
my
gratitude
young
man
him
handing
out
his
catalogue
and
saying
should
like
to
call
your
attention
to
the
delkoff
sir
and
getting
him
to
promise
he
never
use
any
other
as
long
as
he
lived
reuben
vanderpoel
daughter
laughed
as
spontaneously
as
any
girl
might
have
done
selden
laughed
with
her
at
any
rate
she
had
got
mad
so
far
that
was
what
did
it
he
went
on
when
i
rode
away
on
my
bike
i
got
thinking
about
it
and
could
not
get
it
out
of
my
head
the
next
day
i
just
stopped
on
the
road
and
got
off
my
wheel
and
i
says
to
myself
here
business
is
business
if
you
are
travelling
in
europe
and
lunching
at
buckingham
palace
with
the
main
squeeze
get
busy
the
boys
say
if
they
hear
you
missed
a
chance
like
this
you
hit
the
pike
for
stornham
castle
or
whatever
it
called
and
take
your
nerve
with
you
she
ca
do
more
than
have
you
fired
out
and
you
been
fired
before
and
got
your
breath
after
it
so
i
turned
round
and
made
time
and
that
was
how
i
happened
on
your
avenue
and
perhaps
it
was
because
i
was
feeling
a
bit
rattled
i
lost
my
hold
when
the
chain
broke
and
pitched
over
on
my
head
there
i
got
it
off
my
chest
i
was
thinking
i
should
have
to
explain
something
akin
to
her
feeling
of
affection
for
the
nice
westerner
she
had
seen
rambling
in
bond
street
touched
betty
again
the
delkoff
was
the
centre
of
selden
world
as
the
flowers
were
of
kedgers
as
the
little
was
of
welden
were
you
going
to
try
to
sell
me
a
typewriter
she
asked
well
selden
admitted
i
did
know
but
what
there
might
be
use
for
one
writing
business
letters
on
a
big
place
like
this
straight
i
wo
say
i
was
going
to
try
pretty
hard
it
may
look
like
gall
but
you
see
a
fellow
has
to
rush
things
or
he
never
get
there
a
chap
like
me
has
to
get
there
she
was
silent
a
few
moments
and
looked
as
if
she
was
thinking
something
over
her
silence
and
this
look
on
her
face
actually
caused
to
dawn
in
the
breast
of
selden
a
gleam
of
daring
hope
he
looked
round
at
her
with
a
faint
rising
of
colour
say
miss
vanderpoel
say
he
began
and
then
broke
off
yes
said
betty
still
thinking
you
use
one
anywhere
he
said
i
do
want
to
rush

easy
his
head
lifted
from
his
pillow
it
as
easy
as
falling
off
a
log
a
baby
in
a
perambulator
could
learn
to
tick
off
orders
for
its
bottle
and
on
the
square
there
is
its
equal
on
the
market
miss
vanderpoel
there
he
fumbled
beneath
his
pillow
and
actually
brought
forth
his
catalogue
i
asked
the
nurse
to
put
it
there
i
wanted
to
study
it
now
and
then
and
think
up
arguments
see
adjustable
to
hold
with
perfect
ease
an
envelope
an
index
card
or
a
strip
of
paper
no
wider
than
a
postage
stamp
unsurpassed
paper
feed
practical
ribbon
mechanism
perfect
and
permanent
as
mount
dunstan
had
taken
the
book
betty
vanderpoel
took
it
never
had
selden
beheld
such
smiling
in
eyes
about
to
bend
upon
his
catalogue
you
will
raise
your
temperature
she
said
if
you
excite
yourself
you
must
do
that
i
believe
there
are
two
or
three
people
on
the
estate
who
might
be
taught
to
use
a
typewriter
i
will
buy
three
yes
we
will
say
she
would
buy
three
he
soared
to
heights
he
did
not
know
how
to
thank
her
though
he
did
his
best
dizzying
visions
of
what
he
would
have
to
tell
the
boys
when
he
returned
to
new
york
flashed
across
his
mind
the
daughter
of
reuben
vanderpoel
had
bought
three
delkoffs
and
he
was
the
junior
assistant
who
had
sold
them
to
her
you
do
know
what
it
means
to
me
miss
vanderpoel
he
said
but
if
you
were
a
junior
salesman
you
know
it
not
only
the
sale
though
that
a
of
fifteen
dollars
to
me
but
it
because
it
you
that
bought
them
gee
gazing
at
her
with
a
frank
awe
whose
obvious
sincerity
held
a
queer
touch
of
pathos
what
it
must
be
to
be
you
just
you
she
did
not
laugh
she
felt
as
if
a
hand
had
lightly
touched
her
on
her
naked
heart
she
had
thought
of
it
so
often
had
been
bewildered
restlessly
by
it
as
a
mere
child
this
difference
in
human
lot
this
chance
was
it
chance
which
had
placed
her
entity
in
the
centre
of
bettina
vanderpoel
world
instead
of
in
that
of
some
little
cash
girl
with
hair
raked
back
from
a
sallow
face
who
stared
at
her
as
she
passed
in
a
shop
or
in
that
of
the
young
frenchwoman
whose
life
was
spent
in
serving
her
in
caring
for
delicate
dresses
and
keeping
guard
over
ornaments
whose
price
would
have
given
to
her
own
humbleness
ease
for
the
rest
of
existence
what
did
it
mean
and
what
law
was
laid
upon
her
what
law
which
could
only
work
through
her
and
such
as
she
who
had
been
born
with
almost
unearthly
power
laid
in
their
hands
the
reins
of
monstrous
wealth
which
guided
or
drove
the
world
sometimes
fear
touched
her
as
with
this
light
touch
an
her
heart
because
she
did
not
know
the
law
and
could
only
pray
that
her
guessing
at
it
might
be
right
and
even
as
she
thought
these
things
selden
went
on
you
never
can
know
he
said
because
you
always
been
in
it
and
the
rest
of
the
world
ca
know
because
they
never
been
anywhere
near
he
stopped
and
evidently
fell
to
thinking
tell
me
about
the
rest
of
the
world
said
betty
quietly
he
laughed
again
why
i
was
just
thinking
to
myself
you
did
know
a
thing
about
it
and
it
queer
it
the
rest
of
us
that
mounts
up
when
you
come
to
numbers
i
guess
it
run
into
millions
i
not
thinking
of
beggars
and
starving
people
i
been
rushing
the
delkoff
too
steady
to
get
onto
any
swell
charity
organisation
so
i
do
know
about
them
i
just
thinking
of
the
millions
of
fellows
and
women
too
for
the
matter
of
that
that
waken
up
every
morning
and
know
they
got
to
hustle
for
their
ten
per
or
their
fifteen
per
if
they
can
stir
it
up
as
thick
as
that
if
it
as
much
as
fifty
per
of
course
seems
like
to
me
on
easy
street
but
sometimes
those
that
got
to
fifty
per
or
even
more
have
got
more
things
to
do
with
it
kids
you
know
and
more
rent
and
clothes
they
got
to
get
at
it
just
as
hard
as
we
have
why
miss
vanderpoel
how
many
people
do
you
suppose
there
are
in
a
million
that
do
have
to
worry
over
their
next
month
grocery
bills
and
the
rent
of
their
flat
i
bet
there
not
ten
and
i
do
know
the
he
did
not
state
his
case
uncheerfully
the
rest
of
the
world
represented
to
him
the
normal
condition
of
things
most
married
men
a
bit
afraid
to
look
an
honest
grocery
bill
in
the
face
and
they
will
come
in
as
regular
as
spring
hats
and
i
tell
you
when
a
man
got
to
live
on
a
month
a
thing
that
take
all
the
strength
and
energy
out
of
a
bill
sorter
gets
him
down
on
the
like
old
welden
his
roughly
sketched
picture
was
a
graphic
one
the
working
that
bothers
most
of
us
we
were
born
to
that
and
most
of
us
would
feel
like
deadbeats
if
we
were
doing
nothing
it
the
earning
less
than
you
can
live
on
and
getting
a
sort
of
tired
feeling
over
it
it
the
having
to
make
a
look
like
two
and
watching
every
other
fellow
try
to
do
the
same
thing
and
not
often
make
the
trip
there
millions
of
us
just
millions
every
one
of
us
with
his
delkoff
to
sell
his
figure
of
speech
pleased
him
and
he
chuckled
at
his
own
cleverness
and
thinking
of
it
and
talking
about
it
and
under
his
vest
half
afraid
that
he
ca
make
it
and
what
you
say
in
the
morning
when
you
open
your
eyes
and
stretch
yourself
is
gee
i
got
to
sell
a
delkoff
and
suppose
i
should
and
could
hold
down
my
job
i
began
it
over
my
feeding
bottle
so
did
all
the
people
i
know
that
what
gave
me
a
sort
of
a
jolt
just
now
when
i
looked
at
you
and
thought
about
you
being
you
and
what
it
when
their
conversation
ended
she
had
a
much
more
intimate
knowledge
of
new
york
than
she
had
ever
had
before
and
she
felt
it
a
rich
possession
she
had
heard
of
the
hall
bedroom
previously
and
she
had
seen
from
the
outside
the
quick
lunch
counter
but
selden
unconsciously
escorted
her
inside
and
threw
upon
faces
and
lives
the
glare
of
a
flashlight
there
was
a
thing
i
been
thinking
i
ask
you
miss
vanderpoel
he
said
just
before
she
left
him
i
like
you
to
tell
me
if
you
please
it
like
this
you
see
those
two
fellows
treated
me
as
fine
as
silk
i
mean
lord
mount
dunstan
and
penzance
i
never
expected
it
i
never
saw
a
lord
before
much
less
spoke
to
one
but
i
can
tell
you
that
one
just
about
all
right
mount
dunstan
and
the
other
one
the
old
vicar
i
never
taken
to
anyone
since
i
was
born
like
i
took
to
him
the
way
he
puts
on
his
and
looks
at
you
sorter
kind
and
curious
about
you
at
the
same
time
and
his
voice
and
his
way
of
saying
his
words
well
they
just
got
me
sure
and
they
both
of
did
say
they
like
to
see
me
again
now
do
you
think
miss
vanderpoel
it
would
look
too
fresh
if
i
was
to
write
a
polite
note
and
ask
if
either
of
them
could
make
it
convenient
to
come
and
take
a
look
at
me
if
it
would
be
too
much
trouble
i
do
want
to
be
too
fresh
and
perhaps
they
would
come
anyhow
and
if
it
is
please
wo
you
tell
me
miss
vanderpoel
betty
thought
of
mount
dunstan
as
he
had
stood
and
talked
to
her
in
the
deepening
afternoon
sun
she
did
not
know
much
of
him
but
she
thought
having
heard
selden
story
of
the
lunch
that
he
would
come
she
had
never
seen
penzance
but
she
knew
she
should
like
to
see
him
i
think
you
might
write
the
note
she
said
i
believe
they
would
come
to
see
do
you
with
eager
pleasure
then
i
do
it
i
give
a
good
deal
to
see
them
again
i
tell
you
they
are
just
it
both
of
chapter
xxvii
life
mount
dunstan
walking
through
the
park
next
morning
on
his
way
to
the
vicarage
just
after
post
time
met
penzance
himself
coming
to
make
an
equally
early
call
at
the
mount
each
of
them
had
a
letter
in
his
hand
and
each
met
the
other
glance
with
a
smile
g
selden
mount
dunstan
said
and
yours
g
selden
also
answered
the
vicar
poor
young
fellow
what
and
yet
is
it
he
says
he
tells
me
it
is
not
said
mount
dunstan
and
i
agree
with
penzance
read
his
letter
aloud
dear
sir
this
is
to
notify
you
that
owing
to
my
bike
going
back
on
me
when
going
down
hill
i
met
with
an
accident
in
stornham
park
was
cut
about
the
head
and
leg
broken
little
willie
being
far
from
home
and
mother
you
can
see
what
sort
of
fix
he
been
in
if
it
had
been
for
the
kindness
of
reuben
vanderpoel
daughters
miss
bettina
and
her
sister
lady
anstruthers
the
way
they
had
me
taken
care
of
has
been
great
i
been
under
a
nurse
and
doctor
same
as
if
i
was
albert
edward
with
appendycytus
i
apologise
if
that
not
spelt
right
dear
sir
this
is
to
say
that
i
asked
miss
vanderpoel
if
i
should
be
butting
in
too
much
if
i
dropped
a
line
to
ask
if
you
could
spare
the
time
to
call
and
see
me
it
would
be
considered
a
favour
and
appreciated
by
g
selden
delkoff
typewriter
broadway
p
have
already
sold
three
delkoffs
to
miss
upon
my
word
penzance
commented
and
his
amiable
fervour
quite
glowed
i
like
that
queer
young
fellow
i
like
him
he
does
not
wish
to
in
too
much
now
there
is
rudimentary
delicacy
in
that
and
what
a
humorous
forceful
figure
of
speech
some
butting
animal
a
goat
i
seem
to
see
preferably
forcing
its
way
into
a
group
or
closed
circle
of
his
gleeful
analysis
of
the
phrase
had
such
evident
charm
for
him
that
mount
dunstan
broke
into
a
shout
of
laughter
even
as
selden
had
done
at
the
adroit
mention
of
weber
fields
shall
we
ride
over
together
to
see
him
this
morning
an
hour
with
selden
surrounded
by
the
atmosphere
of
reuben
vanderpoel
would
be
a
cheering
thing
he
said
it
would
penzance
answered
let
us
go
by
all
means
we
should
not
i
suppose
with
keen
delight
be
in
upon
lady
anstruthers
too
early
he
was
quite
enraptured
with
his
own
aptness
like
selden
i
should
not
like
to
in
he
added
the
scent
and
warmth
and
glow
of
a
glorious
morning
filled
the
hour
combining
themselves
with
a
certain
normal
human
gaiety
which
surrounded
the
mere
thought
of
selden
they
were
good
things
for
mount
dunstan
life
was
strong
and
young
in
him
and
he
had
laughed
a
big
young
laugh
which
had
perhaps
tended
to
the
waking
in
him
of
the
feeling
he
was
suddenly
conscious
of
that
a
ride
over
a
white
sunlit
road
would
be
pleasant
enough
and
after
all
if
at
the
end
of
the
gallop
one
came
again
upon
that
other
in
whom
life
was
strong
and
young
and
bloomed
on
and
was
the
far
fire
in
the
blue
deeps
of
lovely
eyes
and
the
slim
straightness
of
the
fair
body
why
would
it
not
be
in
a
way
all
to
the
good
he
had
thought
of
her
on
more
than
one
day
and
felt
that
he
wanted
to
see
her
again
let
us
go
he
answered
penzance
one
can
call
on
an
invalid
at
any
time
lady
anstruthers
will
forgive
in
less
than
an
hour
time
they
were
on
their
way
they
laughed
and
talked
as
they
rode
their
horses
hoofs
striking
out
a
cheerful
ringing
accompaniment
to
their
voices
there
is
nothing
more
exhilarating
than
the
hollow
regular
ring
and
of
good
hoofs
going
well
over
a
fine
old
roman
road
in
the
morning
sunlight
they
talked
of
the
junior
assistant
salesman
and
of
miss
vanderpoel
penzance
was
much
pleased
by
the
prospect
of
seeing
this
delightful
and
unusual
he
had
heard
stories
of
her
as
had
lord
westholt
he
knew
of
old
doby
pipe
and
of
welden
respite
from
the
union
and
though
such
incidents
would
seem
mere
trifles
to
the
dweller
in
great
towns
he
had
himself
lived
and
done
his
work
long
enough
in
villages
to
know
the
village
mind
and
the
scale
of
proportions
by
which
its
gladness
and
sadness
were
measured
he
knew
more
of
all
this
than
mount
dunstan
could
since
mount
dunstan
existence
had
isolated
itself
from
rather
gloomy
choice
but
as
he
rode
mount
dunstan
knew
that
he
liked
to
hear
these
things
there
was
the
suggestion
of
new
life
and
new
thought
in
them
and
such
suggestion
was
good
for
any
man
or
woman
either
who
had
fallen
into
living
in
a
dull
narrow
groove
it
is
the
new
life
in
her
which
strikes
me
he
said
she
has
brought
wealth
with
her
and
wealth
is
power
to
do
the
good
or
evil
that
grows
in
a
man
soul
but
she
has
brought
something
more
she
might
have
come
here
and
brought
all
the
sumptuousness
of
a
fashionable
young
beauty
who
drove
through
the
village
and
drew
people
to
their
windows
and
made
clodhoppers
scratch
their
heads
and
pull
their
forelocks
and
children
bob
curtsies
and
stare
she
might
have
come
and
gone
and
left
a
memory
and
nothing
else
a
few
sovereigns
tossed
here
and
there
would
have
earned
her
a
reputation
but
by
gee
to
quote
selden
she
has
begun
living
with
them
as
if
her
ancestors
had
done
it
for
six
hundred
years
and
what
see
is
that
if
she
had
come
without
a
penny
in
her
pocket
she
would
have
done
the
same
he
paused
a
pondering
moment
and
then
drew
a
sharp
breath
which
was
an
exclamation
in
itself
she
life
he
said
she
life
itself
good
god
what
a
thing
it
is
for
a
man
or
woman
to
be
life
instead
of
a
mass
of
tissue
and
muscle
and
nerve
dragged
about
by
the
mere
mechanism
of
living
penzance
had
listened
seriously
what
you
say
is
very
suggestive
he
commented
it
strikes
me
as
true
too
you
have
seen
something
of
her
also
at
least
more
than
i
i
did
not
think
these
things
when
i
saw
her
though
i
suppose
i
felt
them
unconsciously
i
have
reached
this
way
of
summing
her
up
by
processes
of
exclusion
and
inclusion
one
hears
of
her
as
you
know
yourself
and
one
thinks
her
you
have
thought
her
over
a
lot
rather
grumpily
a
beautiful
female
creature
inevitably
gives
an
unbeautiful
male
creature
something
to
think
of
if
he
is
not
otherwise
actively
employed
i
am
not
she
has
become
a
sort
of
dawning
relief
to
my
hopeless
humours
being
a
low
and
unworthy
beast
i
am
sometimes
resentful
enough
of
the
unfairness
of
things
she
has
too
when
they
rode
through
stornham
village
they
saw
signs
of
work
already
done
and
work
still
in
hand
there
were
no
broken
windows
or
palings
or
hanging
wicket
gates
cottage
gardens
had
been
put
in
order
and
there
were
evidences
of
such
cheering
touches
as
new
bits
of
window
curtain
and
young
plants
blooming
between
them
so
many
small
but
necessary
things
had
been
done
that
the
whole
village
wore
the
aspect
of
a
place
which
had
taken
heart
and
was
facing
existence
in
a
hopeful
spirit
a
year
ago
mount
dunstan
and
his
vicar
riding
through
it
had
been
struck
by
its
neglected
and
dispirited
look
as
they
entered
the
hall
of
the
court
miss
vanderpoel
was
descending
the
staircase
she
was
laughing
a
little
to
herself
and
she
looked
pleased
when
she
saw
them
it
is
good
of
you
to
come
she
said
as
they
crossed
the
hall
to
the
but
i
told
him
i
really
thought
you
would
i
have
just
been
talking
to
him
and
he
was
a
little
uncertain
as
to
whether
he
had
assumed
too
as
to
whether
he
had
in
said
penzance
i
think
he
must
have
said
he
did
he
also
was
afraid
that
he
might
have
been
fresh
answered
betty
on
our
part
said
penzance
with
gentle
glee
we
hesitated
a
moment
in
fear
lest
we
also
might
appear
to
be
in
then
they
all
laughed
together
they
were
laughing
when
lady
anstruthers
entered
and
she
herself
joined
them
but
to
mount
dunstan
who
felt
her
to
be
somehow
a
touching
little
person
there
was
manifest
a
tenderness
in
her
feeling
for
selden
for
that
matter
however
there
was
something
already
beginning
to
be
rather
affectionate
in
the
attitude
of
each
of
them
they
went
upstairs
to
find
him
lying
in
state
upon
a
big
sofa
placed
near
a
window
and
his
joy
at
the
sight
of
them
was
a
genuine
human
thing
in
fact
he
had
pondered
a
good
deal
in
secret
on
the
possibility
of
these
swell
people
thinking
he
had
more
than
his
share
of
gall
to
expect
them
to
remember
him
after
he
passed
on
his
junior
assistant
salesman
way
reuben
vanderpoel
daughters
were
of
the
highest
of
his
four
hundred
but
they
were
americans
and
americans
were
not
as
a
rule
so
stuck
on
themselves
as
the
english
and
here
these
two
swells
came
as
friendly
as
you
please
and
that
nice
old
chap
that
was
a
vicar
smiling
and
giving
him
the
glad
hand
betty
and
mount
dunstan
left
penzance
talking
to
the
convalescent
after
a
short
time
mount
dunstan
had
asked
to
be
shown
the
gardens
he
wanted
to
see
the
wonderful
things
he
had
heard
had
been
already
done
to
them
they
went
down
the
stairs
together
and
passed
through
the
into
the
pleasure
grounds
the
once
neglected
lawns
had
already
been
mown
and
rolled
clipped
and
trimmed
until
they
spread
before
the
eye
huge
measures
of
green
velvet
even
the
beds
girdling
and
adorning
them
were
brilliant
with
flowers
kedgers
said
betty
waving
her
hand
in
my
ignorance
i
thought
we
must
wait
for
blossoms
until
next
year
but
it
appears
that
wonders
can
be
brought
all
ready
to
bloom
for
one
from
nursery
gardens
and
can
be
made
to
grow
with
care
and
daring
and
passionate
affection
i
have
seen
kedgers
turn
pale
with
anguish
as
he
hung
over
a
bed
of
transplanted
things
which
seemed
to
droop
too
long
they
droop
just
at
first
you
know
and
then
they
slowly
lift
their
heads
slowly
as
if
to
listen
to
a
voice
calling
calling
once
i
sat
for
quite
a
long
time
before
a
rose
watching
it
when
i
saw
it
begin
to
listen
i
felt
a
little
trembling
pass
over
my
body
i
seemed
to
be
so
strangely
near
to
such
a
strange
thing
it
was
life
life
coming
back
in
answer
to
what
we
can
not
she
had
begun
lightly
and
then
her
voice
had
changed
it
was
very
quiet
at
the
end
of
her
speaking
mount
dunstan
simply
repeated
her
last
words
to
what
we
can
not
one
feels
it
so
much
in
a
garden
she
said
i
have
never
lived
in
a
garden
of
my
own
this
is
not
mine
but
i
have
been
living
in
it
with
kedgers
one
is
so
close
to
life
in
it
the
stirring
in
the
brown
earth
the
piercing
through
of
green
spears
that
breaking
of
buds
and
pouring
forth
of
scent
why
should
one
tremble
if
one
thinks
i
have
stood
in
a
potting
shed
and
watched
kedgers
fill
a
shallow
box
with
damp
rich
mould
and
scatter
over
it
a
thin
layer
of
infinitesimal
seeds
then
he
moistens
them
and
carries
them
reverently
to
his
altars
in
a
greenhouse
the
ledges
in
kedgers
are
altars
i
think
he
offers
prayers
before
them
why
not
i
should
and
when
one
comes
to
see
them
the
moist
seeds
are
swelled
to
fulness
and
when
one
comes
again
they
are
bursting
and
the
next
time
tiny
green
things
are
curling
outward
and
at
last
there
is
a
fairy
forest
of
tiniest
pale
green
stems
and
leaves
and
one
is
standing
close
to
the
secret
of
the
world
and
why
should
not
one
prostrate
one
self
breathing
softly
and
touching
one
awed
forehead
to
the
earth
mount
dunstan
turned
and
looked
at
her
a
pause
in
his
step
they
were
walking
down
a
turfed
path
and
over
their
heads
meeting
branches
of
new
leaves
hung
something
in
his
movement
made
her
turn
and
pause
also
they
both
paused
and
quite
unknowingly
do
you
know
he
said
in
a
low
and
rather
unusual
voice
that
as
we
were
on
our
way
here
i
said
of
you
to
penzance
that
you
were
life
you
for
a
few
seconds
as
they
stood
so
his
look
held
her
their
eyes
involuntarily
and
strangely
held
each
other
something
softly
glowing
in
the
sunlight
falling
on
them
both
something
raining
down
in
the
song
of
a
rising
skylark
trilling
in
the
blue
a
field
away
something
in
the
warmed
incense
of
blossoms
near
them
was
calling
calling
in
the
voice
though
they
did
not
know
they
heard
strangely
a
splendid
blush
rose
in
a
fair
flood
under
her
skin
she
was
conscious
of
it
and
felt
a
second
amazed
impatience
that
she
should
colour
like
a
schoolgirl
suspecting
a
compliment
he
did
not
look
at
her
as
a
man
looks
who
has
made
a
pretty
speech
his
eyes
met
hers
straight
and
thoughtfully
and
he
repeated
his
last
words
as
he
had
before
repeated
hers
that
you
were
life
you
the
bluebells
under
water
were
for
the
moment
incredibly
lovely
her
feeling
about
the
blush
melted
away
as
the
blush
itself
had
done
i
am
glad
you
said
that
she
answered
it
was
a
beautiful
thing
to
say
i
have
often
thought
that
i
should
like
it
to
be
it
is
true
he
said
then
the
skylark
showering
golden
rain
swept
down
to
earth
and
its
nest
in
the
meadow
and
they
walked
on
she
learned
from
him
as
they
walked
together
and
he
also
learned
from
her
in
a
manner
which
built
for
them
as
they
went
from
point
to
point
a
certain
degree
of
delicate
intimacy
gradually
during
their
ramble
tending
to
make
discussion
and
question
possible
her
intelligent
and
broad
interest
in
the
work
on
the
estate
her
frank
desire
to
acquire
such
practical
information
as
she
lacked
aroused
in
himself
an
interest
he
had
previously
seen
no
reason
that
he
should
feel
he
realised
that
his
outlook
upon
the
unusual
situation
was
being
illuminated
by
an
intelligence
at
once
brilliant
and
fine
while
it
was
also
full
of
nice
shading
the
situation
of
course
was
unusual
a
beautiful
young
appearing
upon
the
dark
horizon
of
a
shamefully
estate
and
restoring
with
touches
of
a
wand
of
gold
what
a
fellow
who
was
a
blackguard
should
have
set
in
order
years
ago
that
lady
anstruthers
money
should
have
rescued
her
boy
inheritance
instead
of
being
spent
upon
lavish
viciousness
went
without
saying
what
mount
dunstan
was
most
struck
by
was
the
perfect
clearness
and
its
combination
with
a
certain
judicial
good
breeding
in
miss
view
of
the
matter
she
made
no
confidences
beautifully
candid
as
her
manner
was
but
he
saw
that
she
clearly
understood
the
thing
she
was
doing
and
that
if
her
sister
had
had
no
son
she
would
not
have
done
this
but
something
totally
different
he
had
an
idea
that
lady
anstruthers
would
have
been
swiftly
and
lightly
swept
back
to
new
york
and
sir
nigel
left
to
his
own
devices
in
which
case
stornham
court
and
its
village
would
gradually
have
crumbled
to
decay
it
was
for
sir
ughtred
anstruthers
the
place
was
being
restored
she
was
quite
clear
on
the
matter
of
entail
he
wondered
at
first
not
unnaturally
how
a
girl
had
learned
certain
things
she
had
an
obviously
clear
knowledge
of
as
they
continued
to
converse
he
learned
reuben
vanderpoel
was
without
doubt
a
man
remarkable
not
only
in
the
matter
of
being
the
owner
of
vast
wealth
the
rising
flood
of
his
millions
had
borne
him
upon
its
strange
surface
a
thinking
not
an
unthinking
being
in
fact
a
strong
and
fine
intelligence
his
thousands
of
miles
of
yearly
journeying
in
his
sumptuous
private
car
had
been
the
means
of
his
accumulating
not
merely
added
gains
but
ideas
points
of
view
emotions
a
human
outlook
worth
counting
as
an
asset
his
daughter
when
she
had
travelled
with
him
had
seen
and
talked
with
him
of
all
he
himself
had
seen
when
she
had
not
been
his
companion
she
had
heard
from
him
afterwards
all
best
worth
hearing
she
had
become
without
any
special
process
familiar
with
the
technicalities
of
huge
business
schemes
with
law
and
commerce
and
political
situations
even
her
childish
interest
in
the
world
of
enterprise
and
labour
had
been
passionate
so
she
had
acquired
inevitably
while
almost
unconsciously
a
remarkable
education
if
he
had
not
been
himself
he
might
easily
have
grown
tired
of
a
little
girl
constantly
wanting
to
hear
things
constantly
asking
questions
she
said
but
he
did
not
get
tired
we
invented
a
special
knock
on
the
door
of
his
private
room
it
said
i
come
in
father
if
he
was
busy
he
answered
with
one
knock
on
his
desk
and
i
went
away
if
he
had
time
to
talk
he
called
out
betty
and
i
went
to
him
i
used
to
sit
upon
the
floor
and
lean
against
his
knee
he
had
a
beautiful
way
of
stroking
my
hair
or
my
hand
as
he
talked
he
trusted
me
he
told
me
of
great
things
even
before
he
had
talked
of
them
to
men
he
knew
i
would
never
speak
of
what
was
said
between
us
in
his
room
that
was
part
of
his
trust
he
said
once
that
it
was
a
part
of
the
evolution
of
race
that
men
had
begun
to
expect
of
women
what
in
past
ages
they
really
only
expected
of
each
mount
dunstan
hesitated
before
speaking
you
mean
absolute
faith
apart
from
affection
yes
the
power
to
be
quite
silent
even
when
one
is
tempted
to
speak
if
to
speak
might
betray
what
it
is
wiser
to
keep
to
one
self
because
it
is
another
man
affair
the
kind
of
thing
which
is
good
faith
among
business
men
it
applies
to
small
things
as
much
as
to
large
and
to
other
things
than
mount
dunstan
recalling
his
own
childhood
and
his
own
father
felt
again
the
pressure
of
the
remote
mental
suggestion
that
she
had
had
too
much
a
childhood
and
girlhood
like
this
the
affection
and
companionship
of
a
man
of
large
and
ordered
intelligence
of
clear
and
judicial
outlook
upon
an
immense
area
of
life
and
experience
there
was
no
cause
for
wonder
that
her
young
womanhood
was
all
it
presented
to
himself
as
well
as
to
others
recognising
the
shadow
of
resentment
in
his
thought
he
swept
it
away
an
inward
sense
making
it
clear
to
him
that
if
their
positions
had
been
reversed
she
would
have
been
more
generous
than
himself
he
pulled
himself
together
with
an
unconscious
movement
of
his
shoulders
here
was
the
day
of
early
june
the
gold
of
the
sun
in
its
morning
the
green
shadows
the
turf
they
walked
on
together
the
skylark
rising
again
from
the
meadow
and
showering
down
its
song
why
think
of
anything
else
what
a
line
that
was
which
swept
from
her
chin
down
her
long
slim
throat
to
its
hollow
the
colour
between
the
velvet
of
her
lashes
the
remembrance
of
her
curious
splendid
blush
made
the
man
lost
and
unlived
youth
come
back
to
him
what
did
it
matter
whether
she
was
american
or
english
what
did
it
matter
whether
she
was
insolently
rich
or
beggarly
poor
he
would
let
himself
go
and
forget
all
but
the
pleasure
of
the
sight
and
hearing
of
her
so
as
they
went
they
found
themselves
laughing
together
and
talking
without
restraint
they
went
through
the
flower
and
kitchen
gardens
they
saw
the
once
fallen
wall
rebuilt
now
with
the
old
brick
they
visited
the
greenhouses
and
came
upon
kedgers
entranced
with
business
but
enraptured
at
being
called
upon
to
show
his
treasures
his
eyes
turning
magnetised
upon
betty
revealed
the
story
of
his
soul
mount
dunstan
remarked
that
when
he
spoke
to
her
of
his
flowers
it
was
as
if
there
existed
between
them
the
sympathy
which
might
be
engendered
between
two
who
had
sat
up
together
night
after
night
with
delicate
children
he
stronger
miss
he
said
as
they
paused
before
a
new
wonderful
bloom
what
he
getting
now
is
good
for
him
i
had
to
change
his
food

but
this
seems
all
right
his
colour
betty
herself
bent
over
the
flower
as
she
might
have
bent
over
a
child
her
eyes
softened
she
touched
a
leaf
with
a
slim
finger
as
delicately
as
if
it
had
been
a
baby
cheek
as
mount
dunstan
watched
her
he
drew
a
step
nearer
to
her
side
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
felt
the
glow
of
a
normal
and
simple
pleasure
untouched
by
any
bitterness

old
doby
sitting
at
his
open
window
with
his
pipe
and
illustrated
papers
on
the
table
by
his
side
began
to
find
life
a
series
of
thrills
the
advantage
of
a
window
giving
upon
the
village
street
unspeakably
increased
for
many
years
he
had
preferred
the
chimney
corner
greatly
and
had
rejoiced
at
the
drawing
in
of
winter
days
when
a
fire
must
be
well
kept
up
and
a
man
might
bend
over
it
and
rub
his
hands
slowly
gazing
into
the
red
coals
or
little
pointed
flames
which
seemed
the
only
things
alive
and
worthy
the
watching
the
flames
were
blue
at
the
base
and
yellow
at
the
top
and
jumped
looking
merry
and
caught
at
bits
of
black
coal
and
set
them
crackling
and
throwing
off
splinters
till
they
were
ablaze
and
as
much
alive
as
the
rest
a
man
could
get
comfort
and
entertainment
therefrom
there
was
naught
else
so
good
to
live
with
nothing
happened
in
the
street
and
every
dull
face
that
passed
was
an
old
story
and
told
an
old
tale
of
stupefying
hard
labour
and
hard
days
but
now
the
window
was
a
better
place
to
sit
near
carts
went
by
with
men
whistling
as
they
walked
by
the
horses
heads
loads
of
things
wanted
for
work
at
the
court
new
faces
passed
faces
of
workmen
sometimes
grinning
impident
youngsters
who
larked
with
the
young
women
and
called
out
to
them
as
they
passed
their
cottages
if
a
one
was
loitering
about
her
garden
gate
old
doby
chuckled
at
their
chaff
remembering
dimly
that
seventy
years
ago
he
had
been
just
as
proper
a
young
chap
and
had
made
love
in
the
same
way
lord
lord
yes
he
had
been
a
bold
young
chap
as
ever
winked
an
eye
then
too
there
were
the
vans
and
closed
and
coming
along
slowly
every
few
days
at
first
there
had
come
a
van
from
going
to
the
court
of
course
and
to
sit
there
and
hear
the
women
talk
about
what
might
be
in
them
and
to
try
to
guess
one
self
that
was
a
rare
pastime
fine
things
going
to
the
court
these
days
furniture
and
grandeur
filling
up
the
shabby
or
empty
old
rooms
and
making
them
look
like
other
big
houses
same
as
westerbridge
even
so
the
women
said
the
women
were
always
talking
and
getting
bits
of
news
somehow
and
were
beginning
to
be
worth
listening
to
because
they
had
something
more
interesting
to
talk
about
than
children
shoes
and
whooping
cough
doby
heard
everything
first
from
them
dang
the
women
they
always
knowed
things
it
was
them
as
knowed
about
the
smart
carriages
as
began
to
roll
through
the
one
village
street
they
were
carriages
with
fine
stamping
horses
and
jingling
silver
harness
and
big
coachmen
and
tall
footmen
and
such
like
had
long
ago
dropped
off
showing
themselves
at
stornham
but
now
the
gentry
has
heard
about
miss
vanderpoel
and
what
being
done
at
the
court
and
they
know
what
it
means
said
young
doby
and
they
want
to
see
her
and
find
out
what
she
like
it
her
brings
old
doby
chuckled
and
rubbed
his
hands
he
knew
what
she
was
like
that
straight
slim
back
of
hers
and
the
thick
twist
of
black
hair
and
the
way
she
had
of
laughing
at
you
as
cheery
as
if
a
bell
was
ringing
aye
he
knew
all
about
that
when
they
see
her
once
they
come
agen
for
sure
he
quavered
shrilly
and
day
by
day
he
watched
for
the
grand
carriages
with
vivid
eagerness
if
a
day
or
two
passed
without
his
seeing
one
he
grew
fretful
and
was
injured
feeling
that
his
beauty
was
being
neglected
none
nor
yet
he
would
cackle
what
be
they
folk
old
welden
having
heard
of
the
pipe
and
come
to
see
it
had
struck
up
an
acquaintance
with
him
and
dropped
in
almost
every
day
to
talk
and
sit
at
his
window
she
was
a
young
thing
by
comparison
and
could
bring
him
lively
news
and
indeed
so
stir
him
up
with
her
gossip
that
he
was
in
danger
of
becoming
a
young
thing
himself
her
groceries
and
his
tobacco
were
subjects
whose
interest
was
undying
a
great
curiosity
had
been
awakened
in
the
county
and
visitors
came
from
distances
greater
than
such
as
ordinarily
include
usual
calls
naturally
one
was
curious
about
the
daughter
of
the
vanderpoel
who
was
a
sort
of
national
institution
in
his
own
country
his
name
had
not
been
so
much
heard
of
in
england
when
lady
anstruthers
had
arrived
but
there
had
at
first
been
felt
an
interest
in
her
but
she
had
been
a
failure
a
girl
whose
thin
fair
prettiness
had
no
distinction
and
who
was
obviously
overwhelmed
by
her
surroundings
she
had
evidently
had
no
influence
over
sir
nigel
and
had
not
been
able
to
prevent
his
making
ducks
and
drakes
of
her
money
which
of
course
ought
to
have
been
spent
on
the
estate
besides
which
a
married
woman
represented
fewer
potentialities
than
a
handsome
unmarried
girl
entitled
to
expectations
from
huge
american
wealth
so
the
carriages
came
and
came
again
and
stately
or
unstately
neighbours
sat
at
tea
upon
the
lawn
under
the
trees
and
it
was
observed
that
the
methods
and
appointments
of
the
court
had
entirely
changed
nothing
looked
new
and
american
the
silently
moving
could
not
have
been
improved
upon
there
was
plainly
an
excellent
chef
somewhere
and
the
massive
silver
was
old
and
wonderful
upon
everybody
word
the
change
was
such
as
it
was
worth
a
long
drive
merely
to
see
the
most
wonderful
thing
however
was
lady
anstruthers
herself
she
had
begun
to
grow
delicately
plump
her
once
drawn
and
haggard
face
had
rounded
out
her
skin
had
smoothed
and
was
actually
becoming
pink
and
fair
a
nimbus
of
pale
fine
hair
puffed
airily
over
her
forehead
and
she
wore
the
most
charming
little
clothes
all
of
which
made
her
look
fifteen
years
younger
than
she
had
seemed
when
on
the
grounds
of
she
had
retired
into
seclusion
the
renewed
relations
with
her
family
the
atmosphere
by
which
she
was
surrounded
had
evidently
given
her
a
fresh
lease
of
life
and
awakened
in
her
a
new
courage
when
the
summer
epidemic
of
garden
parties
broke
forth
old
doby
gleefully
beheld
day
after
day
the
court
carriage
drive
by
bearing
her
ladyship
and
her
sister
attired
in
fairest
shades
and
tints
same
as
if
they
was
their
delicate
vaporousness
and
rare
colours
were
sweet
delights
to
the
old
man
and
he
and
welden
spent
happy
evenings
discussing
them
as
personal
possessions
to
these
two
betty
was
a
personal
possession
bestowing
upon
them
a
marked
distinction
they
were
hers
and
she
was
theirs
no
one
else
so
owned
her
heaven
had
given
her
to
them
that
their
last
years
might
be
lighted
with
splendour
on
her
way
to
one
of
the
garden
parties
she
stopped
the
carriage
before
old
doby
cottage
and
went
in
to
him
to
speak
a
few
words
she
was
of
pale
convolvulus
blue
that
afternoon
and
doby
standing
up
touching
his
forelock
and
welden
curtsying
gazed
at
her
with
prayer
in
their
eyes
she
had
a
few
flowers
in
her
hand
and
a
book
of
coloured
photographs
of
venice
these
are
pictures
of
the
city
i
told
you
about
the
city
built
in
the
sea
where
the
streets
are
water
you
and
welden
can
look
at
them
together
she
said
as
she
laid
flowers
and
book
down
i
am
going
to
dunholm
castle
to
a
garden
party
this
afternoon
some
day
i
will
come
and
tell
you
about
the
two
were
at
the
window
staring
spellbound
as
she
swept
back
to
the
carriage
between
the
and
canterbury
bells
bordering
the
narrow
garden
path
do
you
know
i
really
went
in
to
let
them
see
my
dress
she
said
when
she
rejoined
lady
anstruthers
old
doby
granddaughter
told
me
that
he
and
welden
have
little
quarrels
about
the
colours
i
wear
it
seems
that
they
find
my
wardrobe
an
absorbing
interest
when
i
put
the
book
on
the
table
i
felt
doby
touch
my
sleeve
with
his
trembling
old
hand
he
thought
i
did
not
what
will
they
do
with
venice
asked
rosy
they
will
believe
the
water
is
as
blue
as
the
photographs
make
it
and
the
palaces
as
pink
it
will
seem
like
a
chapter
out
of
revelations
which
they
can
believe
is
true
and
not
merely
because
have
been
there
i
wish
i
had
been
to
the
city
of
the
gates
of
pearl
and
could
tell
them
about
on
the
lawns
at
the
garden
parties
she
was
much
gazed
at
and
commented
upon
her
height
and
her
long
slender
neck
held
her
head
above
those
of
other
girls
the
dense
black
of
her
hair
made
a
rich
note
of
shadow
amid
the
prevailing
english
blondness
her
mere
colouring
set
her
apart
rosy
used
to
watch
her
with
tender
wonder
recalling
her
memory
of
betty
with
the
long
slim
legs
and
the
demanding
and
accusing
she
had
always
been
this
creature
even
in
those
days
at
the
garden
party
at
dunholm
castle
it
became
evident
that
she
was
after
a
manner
unusually
the
central
figure
of
the
occasion
it
was
not
at
all
surprising
people
said
to
each
other
nothing
could
have
been
more
desirable
for
lord
westholt
he
combined
rank
with
fortune
and
the
vanderpoel
wealth
almost
constituted
rank
in
itself
both
lord
and
lady
dunholm
seemed
pleased
with
the
girl
lord
dunholm
showed
her
great
attention
when
she
took
part
in
the
dancing
on
the
lawn
he
looked
on
delightedly
he
walked
about
the
gardens
with
her
and
it
was
plain
to
see
that
their
conversation
was
not
the
ordinary
polite
effort
to
accord
usually
marking
the
talk
between
a
mature
man
and
a
merely
pretty
girl
lord
dunholm
sometimes
laughed
with
unfeigned
delight
and
sometimes
the
two
seemed
to
talk
of
grave
things
such
occasions
as
these
are
a
sort
of
yearly
taking
of
the
social
census
of
the
county
lord
dunholm
explained
one
invites
all
neighbours
and
is
invited
again
it
is
a
friendly
duty
one
i
do
not
see
lord
mount
dunstan
betty
answered
is
he
here
she
had
never
denied
to
herself
her
interest
in
mount
dunstan
and
she
had
looked
for
him
lord
dunholm
hesitated
a
second
as
his
son
had
done
at
miss
vanderpoel
mention
of
the
tabooed
name
but
being
an
older
man
he
felt
more
at
liberty
to
speak
and
gave
her
a
rather
long
kind
look
my
dear
young
lady
he
said
did
you
expect
to
see
him
here
yes
i
think
i
did
betty
replied
with
slow
softness
i
believe
i
rather
hoped
i
indeed
you
are
interested
in
him
i
know
him
very
little
but
i
am
interested
i
will
tell
you
she
paused
by
a
seat
beneath
a
tree
and
they
sat
down
together
she
gave
with
a
few
swift
vivid
touches
a
sketch
of
the
passenger
on
the
meridiana
of
whom
she
had
only
thought
that
he
was
an
unhappy
young
man
until
the
brief
moment
in
which
they
had
stood
face
to
face
each
comprehending
that
the
other
was
to
be
relied
on
if
the
worst
should
come
to
the
worst
she
had
understood
his
prompt
disappearance
from
the
scene
and
had
liked
it
when
she
related
the
incident
of
her
meeting
with
him
when
she
thought
him
a
mere
keeper
on
his
own
lands
lord
dunholm
listened
with
a
changed
and
thoughtful
expression
the
effect
produced
upon
her
imagination
by
what
she
had
seen
her
silent
wandering
through
the
sad
beauty
of
the
wronged
place
led
by
the
man
who
tried
stiffly
to
bear
himself
as
a
servant
his
unintended
her
clear
point
of
view
charmed
him
she
had
seen
the
thing
set
apart
from
its
county
scandal
and
so
had
read
possibilities
others
had
been
blind
to
he
was
immensely
touched
by
certain
things
she
said
about
the
first
man
he
is
one
of
them
she
said
they
find
their
way
in
the
end
they
find
their
way
but
just
now
he
thinks
there
is
none
he
is
standing
in
the
dark
where
the
roads
you
think
he
will
find
his
way
lord
dunholm
said
why
do
you
think
so
because
i
know
he
will
she
answered
but
i
can
not
tell
you
why
i
what
you
have
said
has
been
interesting
to
me
because
of
the
light
your
own
thought
threw
upon
what
you
saw
it
has
not
been
mount
dunstan
i
have
been
caring
for
but
for
the
light
you
saw
him
in
you
met
him
without
prejudice
and
you
carried
the
light
in
your
hand
you
always
carry
a
light
my
impression
is
very
quietly
some
women
the
prejudice
you
speak
of
must
be
a
bitter
thing
for
a
proud
man
to
bear
is
it
a
just
prejudice
what
has
he
done
lord
dunholm
was
gravely
silent
for
a
few
moments
it
is
an
extraordinary
thing
to
reflect
his
words
came
slowly
that
it
may
not
be
a
just
prejudice
do
not
know
that
he
has
done
anything
but
seem
rather
sulky
and
be
the
son
of
his
father
and
the
brother
of
his
and
go
to
america
said
betty
he
could
have
avoided
doing
that
but
he
can
not
be
called
to
account
for
his
relations
if
that
is
all
the
prejudice
is
not
no
it
is
not
said
lord
dunholm
and
one
feels
rather
awkward
at
having
shared
it
you
have
set
me
thinking
again
miss
chapter
xxix
the
thread
of
selden
the
shuttle
having
in
its
weaving
caught
up
the
thread
of
rudimentary
existence
and
drawn
it
with
the
young
man
himself
across
the
sea
used
curiously
the
thread
in
question
in
the
forming
of
the
design
of
its
huge
web
as
wool
and
coarse
linen
are
sometimes
interwoven
with
rich
silk
for
decorative
or
utilitarian
purposes
so
perhaps
was
this
previously
unvalued
material
employed
it
was
indeed
an
interesting
truth
that
the
young
man
during
his
convalescence
without
his
own
knowledge
acted
as
a
species
of
magnet
which
drew
together
persons
who
might
not
easily
otherwise
have
met
penzance
and
mount
dunstan
rode
over
to
see
him
every
few
days
and
their
visits
naturally
established
relations
with
stornham
court
much
more
intimate
than
could
have
formed
themselves
in
the
same
length
of
time
under
any
of
the
ordinary
circumstances
of
country
life
conventionalities
lost
their
prominence
in
friendly
intercourse
with
selden
it
was
not
however
that
he
himself
desired
to
dispense
with
convention
his
intense
wish
to
do
the
right
thing
and
avoid
giving
offence
was
the
most
ingenuous
and
touching
feature
of
his
broad
cosmopolitan
good
nature
if
i
ever
make
a
break
sir
he
had
once
said
with
almost
passionate
fervour
in
talking
to
penzance
please
tell
me
and
set
me
on
the
right
track
no
fellow
likes
to
look
like
a
hoosier
but
i
do
mind
that
half
as
much
as
as
seeming
not
to
he
used
the
word
appreciate
frequently
it
expressed
for
him
many
degrees
of
thanks
i
tell
you
that
fine
he
said
to
ughtred
who
brought
him
a
flower
from
the
garden
i
appreciate
to
betty
he
said
more
than
once
you
know
how
i
appreciate
all
this
miss
vanderpoel
you
do
know
i
appreciate
it
do
you
he
had
an
immense
admiration
for
mount
dunstan
and
talked
to
him
a
great
deal
about
america
often
about
the
sheep
ranch
and
what
it
might
have
done
and
ought
to
have
done
but
his
admiration
for
penzance
became
affection
to
him
he
talked
oftener
about
england
and
listened
to
the
vicar
scholarly
stories
of
its
history
its
past
glories
and
its
present
ones
as
he
might
have
listened
at
fourteen
to
stories
from
the
arabian
nights
these
two
being
frequently
absorbed
in
conversation
mount
dunstan
was
rather
thrown
upon
betty
hands
when
they
strolled
together
about
the
place
or
sat
under
the
deep
shade
of
green
trees
they
talked
not
only
of
england
and
america
but
of
divers
things
which
increased
their
knowledge
of
each
other
it
is
points
of
view
which
reveal
qualities
tendencies
and
innate
differences
or
accordances
of
thought
and
the
points
of
view
of
each
interested
the
other
mr
selden
is
asking
penzance
questions
about
english
history
betty
said
on
one
of
the
afternoons
in
which
they
sat
in
the
shade
i
need
not
ask
you
questions
you
are
english
and
you
are
american
history
mount
dunstan
answered
i
suppose
i
at
one
of
their
chance
meetings
miss
vanderpoel
had
told
lord
dunholm
and
lord
westholt
something
of
the
story
of
selden
the
novelty
of
it
had
delighted
and
amused
them
lord
dunholm
had
at
points
been
touched
as
penzance
had
been
westholt
had
felt
that
he
must
ride
over
to
stornham
to
see
the
convalescent
he
wanted
to
learn
some
new
york
slang
he
would
take
lessons
from
selden
and
he
would
also
buy
a
delkoff
two
delkoffs
if
that
would
be
better
he
knew
a
fellow
who
ought
to
have
a
typewriter
heath
ought
to
have
one
he
had
said
to
his
father
heath
was
the
think
of
the
letters
the
poor
chap
has
to
write
to
to
order
things
and
unorder
them
and
blackguard
the
shopkeepers
when
they
are
not
satisfactory
invest
in
one
for
heath
it
is
by
no
means
a
bad
idea
lord
dunholm
reflected
time
would
be
saved
by
the
use
of
it
i
have
no
it
saves
time
in
any
department
where
it
can
be
used
betty
had
answered
three
are
now
in
use
at
stornham
and
i
am
going
to
present
one
to
kedgers
this
is
a
testimonial
i
am
offering
three
weeks
ago
i
began
to
use
the
delkoff
since
then
i
have
used
no
other
if
you
use
them
you
will
introduce
them
to
the
she
understood
the
feeling
of
the
junior
assistant
when
he
found
himself
in
the
presence
of
possible
purchasers
her
blood
tingled
slightly
she
wished
she
had
brought
a
catalogue
we
will
come
to
stornham
to
see
the
catalogue
lord
dunholm
promised
perhaps
you
will
read
it
aloud
to
us
westholt
suggested
gleefully
g
selden
knows
it
by
heart
and
will
repeat
it
to
you
with
running
comments
do
you
know
i
shall
be
very
glad
if
you
decide
to
buy
one
or
two
or
three
with
an
uplift
of
the
irish
blue
eyes
to
lord
dunholm
the
blood
of
the
first
reuben
vanderpoel
stirs
in
my
veins
also
i
have
begun
to
be
fond
of
therefore
it
occurred
that
on
the
afternoon
referred
to
lady
anstruthers
appeared
crossing
the
sward
with
two
male
visitors
in
her
wake
lord
dunholm
and
lord
westholt
said
betty
rising
for
this
meeting
between
the
men
selden
was
without
doubt
responsible
while
his
father
talked
to
mount
dunstan
westholt
explained
that
they
had
come
athirst
for
the
catalogue
presently
betty
took
him
to
the
sheltered
corner
of
the
lawn
where
the
convalescent
sat
with
penzance
but
for
a
short
time
lord
dunholm
remained
to
converse
with
mount
dunstan
in
a
way
the
situation
was
delicate
to
encounter
by
chance
a
neighbour
whom
one
for
reasons
has
not
seen
since
his
childhood
and
to
be
equal
to
passing
over
and
gracefully
obliterating
the
intervening
years
makes
demand
even
upon
finished
tact
lord
dunholm
world
had
been
a
large
one
and
he
had
acquired
experience
tending
to
the
development
of
the
most
perfect
methods
if
selden
had
chanced
to
be
the
magnet
which
had
decided
his
course
this
special
afternoon
miss
vanderpoel
it
was
who
had
stirred
in
him
sufficient
interest
in
mount
dunstan
to
cause
him
to
use
the
best
of
these
methods
when
he
found
himself
face
to
face
with
him
he
beautifully
eliminated
the
years
he
eliminated
all
but
the
facts
that
the
young
man
father
and
himself
had
been
acquaintances
in
youth
that
he
remembered
mount
dunstan
himself
as
a
child
that
he
had
heard
with
interest
of
his
visit
to
america
whatsoever
the
young
man
felt
he
made
no
sign
which
presented
obstacles
he
accepted
the
eliminations
with
outward
composure
he
was
a
fellow
with
a
fine
way
of
carrying
his
shoulders
and
an
eye
which
might
be
able
to
light
savagely
but
just
now
at
least
he
showed
nothing
of
the
sulkiness
he
was
accused
of
lord
dunholm
progressed
admirably
with
him
he
soon
found
that
he
need
not
be
upon
any
strain
with
regard
to
the
eliminations
the
man
himself
could
eliminate
which
was
an
assistance
they
talked
together
when
they
turned
to
follow
the
others
to
the
retreat
of
selden
have
you
bought
a
delkoff
lord
dunholm
inquired
if
i
could
have
afforded
it
i
should
have
bought
i
think
that
we
have
come
here
with
the
intention
of
buying
three
we
did
not
know
we
required
them
until
miss
vanderpoel
recited
half
a
page
of
the
catalogue
to
three
will
mean
a
off
of
fifteen
dollars
to
selden
said
mount
dunstan
it
was
he
saw
necessary
that
he
should
explain
the
meaning
of
a
rake
off
and
he
did
so
to
his
companion
entertainment
the
afternoon
was
a
satisfactory
one
they
were
all
kind
to
selden
and
he
on
his
part
was
an
aid
to
them
in
his
innocence
he
steered
three
of
them
at
least
through
narrow
places
into
an
open
sea
of
easy
intercourse
this
was
a
good
beginning
the
junior
assistant
was
recovering
rapidly
and
looked
remarkably
well
the
doctor
had
told
him
that
he
might
try
to
use
his
leg
the
inside
cabin
of
the
cheap
liner
and
little
old
new
york
were
looming
up
before
him
but
what
luck
he
had
had
and
what
a
holiday
it
had
been
enough
to
set
a
fellow
up
for
ten
years
work
it
would
set
up
the
boys
merely
to
be
told
about
it
he
did
know
what
he
had
ever
done
to
deserve
such
luck
as
had
happened
to
him
for
the
rest
of
his
life
he
would
he
waving
the
union
jack
alongside
of
the
stars
and
stripes
penzance
it
was
who
suggested
that
he
should
try
the
strength
of
the
leg
now
yes
mount
dunstan
said
let
me
help
as
he
rose
to
go
to
him
westholt
got
up
also
they
took
their
places
at
either
side
of
his
invalid
chair
and
assisted
him
to
rise
and
stand
on
his
feet
it
all
right
gentlemen
it
all
right
he
called
out
with
a
delighted
flush
when
he
found
himself
upright
i
believe
i
could
stand
alone
thank
you
thank
he
was
able
leaning
on
mount
dunstan
arm
to
take
a
few
steps
evidently
in
a
short
time
he
would
find
himself
no
longer
disabled
penzance
had
invited
him
to
spend
a
week
at
the
vicarage
he
was
to
do
this
as
soon
as
he
could
comfortably
drive
from
the
one
place
to
the
other
after
receiving
the
invitation
he
had
sent
secretly
to
london
for
one
of
the
delkoffs
he
had
brought
with
him
from
america
as
a
specimen
he
cherished
in
private
a
plan
of
gently
entertaining
his
host
by
teaching
him
to
use
the
machine
the
vicar
would
thus
be
prepared
for
that
future
in
which
surely
a
delkoff
must
in
some
way
fall
into
his
hands
indeed
fortune
having
at
length
cast
an
eye
on
himself
might
chance
to
favour
him
further
and
in
time
he
might
be
able
to
send
a
machine
as
a
grateful
gift
to
the
vicarage
perhaps
penzance
would
accept
it
because
he
would
understand
what
it
meant
of
feeling
and
appreciation
during
the
afternoon
lord
dunholm
managed
to
talk
a
good
deal
with
mount
dunstan
there
was
no
air
of
intention
in
his
manner
nevertheless
intention
was
concealed
beneath
its
courteous
amiability
he
wanted
to
get
at
the
man
before
they
parted
he
felt
he
had
perhaps
learned
things
opening
up
new
points
of
view
in
the
at
dunholm
that
night
he
and
his
son
talked
of
their
chance
encounter
it
seemed
possible
that
mistakes
had
been
made
about
mount
dunstan
one
did
not
form
a
definite
idea
of
a
man
character
in
the
course
of
an
afternoon
but
he
himself
had
been
impressed
by
a
conviction
that
there
had
been
mistakes
we
are
rather
a
lot
in
the
country
when
we
allow
ourselves
to
be
taken
possession
of
by
an
idea
westholt
commented
i
am
not
at
all
proud
of
the
way
in
which
we
have
taken
things
for
granted
was
his
father
summing
up
it
is
perhaps
worth
observing
taking
his
cigar
from
his
mouth
and
smiling
at
the
end
of
it
as
he
removed
the
ash
that
but
for
miss
vanderpoel
and
selden
we
might
never
have
had
an
opportunity
of
facing
the
fact
that
we
may
not
have
been
giving
fair
play
and
one
has
prided
one
self
on
fair
chapter
xxx
a
return
at
the
close
of
a
long
warm
afternoon
betty
vanderpoel
came
out
upon
the
square
stone
terrace
overlooking
the
gardens
and
that
part
of
the
park
which
enclosing
them
caused
them
as
they
melted
into
its
greenness
to
lose
all
limitations
and
appear
to
be
only
a
more
blooming
bit
of
the
landscape
upon
the
garden
betty
eyes
dwelt
as
she
stood
still
for
some
minutes
taking
in
their
effect
thoughtfully
kedgers
had
certainly
accomplished
much
his
lawns
did
him
credit
his
flower
beds
were
flushed
and
azured
purpled
and
snowed
with
bloom
sweet
tall
spires
hung
with
blue
or
white
or
rosy
flower
bells
lifted
their
heads
above
the
colour
of
lower
growths
only
the
fervent
affection
the
fasting
and
prayer
of
a
kedgers
could
have
done
such
wonders
with
new
things
and
old
the
old
ones
he
had
cherished
and
allured
into
a
renewal
of
existence
the
new
ones
he
had
so
coaxed
out
of
their
earthen
pots
into
the
soil
luxuriously
prepared
for
their
reception
and
had
afterwards
so
nourished
and
bedewed
with
soft
waterings
so
supported
watched
over
and
adored
that
they
had
been
almost
unconscious
of
their
transplanting
without
assistants
he
could
have
done
nothing
but
he
had
been
given
a
sufficient
number
of
under
gardeners
and
had
even
managed
to
inspire
them
with
something
of
his
own
ambition
and
solicitude
the
result
was
before
betty
eyes
in
an
aspect
which
to
such
as
knew
the
gardens
well
the
dunholms
for
instance
was
astonishing
in
its
success
i
had
privileges
miss
and
so
have
the
flowers
kedgers
had
said
warmly
when
miss
vanderpoel
had
reported
to
him
for
his
encouragement
dunholm
castle
praise
not
one
of
has
ever
had
to
wait
for
his
food
and
drink
nor
to
complain
of
his
bed
not
being
what
he
was
accustomed
to
they
not
had
to
wait
for
rain
for
we
given
it
to
from
watering
cans
and
thank
goodness
the
season
been
kind
to
betty
descending
the
terrace
steps
wandered
down
the
paths
between
the
flower
beds
glancing
about
her
as
she
went
the
air
of
neglect
and
desolation
had
been
swept
away
buttle
and
tim
soames
had
been
given
as
many
privileges
as
kedgers
the
chief
points
impressed
upon
them
had
been
that
the
work
must
be
done
not
only
thoroughly
but
quickly
as
many
additional
workmen
as
they
required
as
much
solid
material
as
they
needed
but
there
must
be
a
despatch
which
at
first
it
staggered
them
to
contemplate
they
had
not
known
such
methods
before
they
had
been
accustomed
to
work
under
money
limitation
throughout
their
lives
and
when
work
must
be
done
with
insufficient
aid
it
must
be
done
slowly
economy
had
been
the
chief
factor
in
all
calculations
speed
had
not
entered
into
them
so
leisureliness
had
become
a
fixed
habit
but
it
seemed
american
to
sweep
leisureliness
away
into
space
with
a
free
gesture
it
must
be
done
quickly
miss
vanderpoel
had
said
if
ten
men
can
not
do
it
quickly
enough
you
must
have
twenty
or
as
many
more
as
are
needed
it
is
time
which
must
be
saved
just
time
more
than
money
it
appeared
buttle
experience
had
been
that
you
might
take
time
if
you
did
not
charge
for
it
when
time
began
to
mean
money
that
was
a
different
matter
if
you
did
work
by
the
job
you
might
drive
in
a
few
nails
loiter
and
return
without
haste
if
you
worked
by
the
hour
your
absence
would
be
inquired
into
in
the
present
case
no
one
could
loiter
that
was
realised
early
the
tall
girl
with
the
deep
straight
look
at
you
made
you
realise
that
without
spoken
words
she
expected
energy
something
like
her
own
she
was
a
new
force
and
spurred
them
no
man
knew
how
it
was
done
but
when
she
appeared
among
them
even
in
the
afternoon
lookin
that
womany
holding
up
her
thin
dress
over
lace
petticoats
the
like
of
which
had
not
been
seen
before
she
looked
on
with
just
the
same
straight
expecting
eyes
they
did
not
seem
to
doubt
in
the
least
that
she
would
find
that
great
advance
had
been
made
so
advance
had
been
made
and
work
accomplished
as
betty
walked
from
one
place
to
another
she
saw
the
signs
of
it
with
gratification
the
place
was
not
the
one
she
had
come
to
a
few
months
ago
hothouses
outbuildings
stables
were
in
repair
work
was
still
being
done
in
different
places
in
the
house
itself
carpenters
or
decorators
were
enclosed
in
some
rooms
and
at
their
business
but
exterior
order
prevailed
in
the
courtyard
stablemen
were
at
work
and
her
own
groom
came
forward
touching
his
forehead
she
paid
a
visit
to
the
horses
they
were
fine
creatures
and
when
she
entered
their
stalls
made
room
for
her
and
whinnied
gently
in
expectation
of
sugar
and
bread
which
were
kept
in
a
cupboard
awaiting
her
visits
she
smoothed
velvet
noses
and
patted
satin
sides
talking
to
mason
a
little
before
she
went
her
way
then
she
strolled
into
the
park
the
park
was
always
a
pleasure
she
was
in
a
thoughtful
mood
and
the
soft
green
shadowed
silence
lured
her
the
summer
wind
the
branches
as
it
lightly
waved
them
the
brown
earth
of
the
avenue
was
there
were
bird
notes
and
calls
to
be
heard
here
and
there
and
everywhere
if
one
only
arrested
attention
a
moment
to
listen
and
she
was
in
a
listening
and
dreaming
mood
one
of
the
moods
in
which
bird
leaf
and
wind
sun
shade
and
scent
of
growing
things
have
part
and
yet
her
thoughts
were
of
mundane
things
it
was
on
this
avenue
that
selden
had
met
with
his
accident
he
was
still
at
dunstan
vicarage
and
yesterday
mount
dunstan
in
calling
had
told
them
that
penzance
was
applying
himself
with
delighted
interest
to
a
study
of
the
manipulation
of
the
delkoff
the
thought
of
mount
dunstan
brought
with
it
the
thought
of
her
father
this
was
because
there
was
frequently
in
her
mind
a
connection
between
the
two
how
would
the
man
of
schemes
of
wealth
and
power
almost
unbounded
regard
the
man
born
with
a
load
about
his
neck
chained
to
earth
by
it
standing
in
the
midst
of
his
hungering
and
thirsting
possessions
his
hands
empty
of
what
would
feed
them
and
restore
their
strength
would
he
see
any
solution
of
the
problem
she
could
imagine
his
looking
at
the
situation
through
his
gaze
at
the
man
and
considering
both
in
his
summing
up
circumstances
and
the
man
she
had
heard
him
say
but
always
the
man
being
no
visionary
he
did
not
underestimate
the
power
of
circumstance
this
betty
had
learned
from
him
and
what
could
practically
be
done
with
circumstance
such
as
this
the
question
had
begun
to
recur
to
her
what
could
she
herself
have
done
in
the
care
of
rosy
and
stornham
if
chance
had
not
placed
in
her
hand
the
strongest
lever
what
she
had
accomplished
had
been
easy
easy
all
that
had
been
required
had
been
the
qualities
which
control
of
the
lever
might
itself
tend
to
create
in
one
given
by
mere
chance
again
imagination
and
initiative
the
moving
of
the
lever
did
the
rest
if
chance
had
not
been
on
one
side
what
then
and
where
was
this
man
chance
she
had
said
to
rosy
in
speaking
of
the
wealth
of
america
sometimes
one
is
tired
of
and
rosy
had
reminded
her
that
there
were
those
who
were
not
tired
of
it
who
could
bear
some
of
the
burden
of
it
if
it
might
be
laid
on
their
own
shoulders
the
great
beautiful
house
awaiting
its
slow
doom
in
the
midst
of
its
lonely
unfed
lands
what
could
save
it
and
all
it
represented
of
race
and
name
and
the
stately
history
of
men
but
the
power
one
professed
to
call
base
and
sordid
mere
money
she
felt
a
sudden
impatience
at
herself
for
having
said
she
was
tired
of
it
that
was
a
folly
which
took
upon
itself
the
aspect
of
an
affectation
and
if
a
man
could
not
earn
money
or
go
forth
to
rob
richer
neighbours
of
it
as
in
the
good
old
marauding
days
or
accept
it
if
it
were
offered
to
him
as
a
gift
what
could
he
do
nothing
if
he
had
been
born
a
village
labourer
he
could
have
earned
by
the
work
of
his
hands
enough
to
keep
his
cottage
roof
over
him
and
have
held
up
his
head
among
his
fellows
but
for
such
as
himself
there
was
no
mere
labour
which
would
avail
he
had
not
that
rough
honest
resource
only
the
decent
living
and
orderly
management
of
the
generations
behind
him
would
have
left
to
him
fairly
his
own
chance
to
hold
with
dignity
the
place
in
the
world
into
which
fate
had
thrust
him
at
the
outset
a
blind
newborn
thing
of
whom
no
permission
had
been
asked
if
i
broke
stones
upon
the
highway
for
twelve
hours
a
day
i
might
earn
two
shillings
he
had
said
to
betty
on
the
previous
day
i
could
break
stones
well
holding
out
a
big
arm
but
fourteen
shillings
a
week
will
do
no
more
than
buy
bread
and
bacon
for
a
he
was
ordinarily
rather
silent
and
stiff
in
his
conversational
attitude
towards
his
own
affairs
betty
sometimes
wondered
how
she
herself
knew
so
much
about
them
how
it
happened
that
her
thoughts
so
often
dwelt
upon
them
the
explanation
she
had
once
made
to
herself
had
been
half
irony
half
serious
reflection
it
is
a
result
of
the
first
reuben
vanderpoel
it
is
because
i
am
of
the
fighting
commercial
stock
and
when
i
see
a
business
problem
i
can
not
leave
it
alone
even
when
it
is
no
affair
of
as
an
exposition
of
the
type
of
the
commercial
she
presented
as
she
paused
beneath
overshadowing
trees
an
aspect
beautifully
suggesting
a
far
different
thing
she
stood
all
white
from
slim
shoe
to
tilted
parasol
and
either
the
result
of
her
inspection
of
the
work
done
by
her
order
or
a
combination
of
her
mood
with
her
feeling
for
the
problem
had
given
her
a
special
radiance
it
glowed
on
lip
and
cheek
and
shone
in
her
irish
eyes
she
had
paused
to
look
at
a
man
approaching
down
the
avenue
he
was
not
a
labourer
and
she
did
not
know
him
men
who
were
not
labourers
usually
rode
or
drove
and
this
one
was
walking
he
was
neither
young
nor
old
and
though
at
a
distance
his
aspect
was
not
attracting
she
found
that
she
regarded
him
curiously
and
waited
for
him
to
draw
nearer
the
man
himself
was
glancing
about
him
with
a
puzzled
look
and
knitted
forehead
when
he
had
passed
through
the
village
he
had
seen
things
he
had
not
expected
to
see
when
he
had
reached
the
entrance
gate
and
for
reasons
of
his
own
dismissed
his
station
trap
he
had
looked
at
the
lodge
scrutinisingly
because
he
was
not
prepared
for
its
picturesque
trimness
the
avenue
was
free
from
weeds
and
in
order
the
two
gates
beyond
him
were
new
and
substantial
as
he
went
on
his
way
and
reached
the
first
he
saw
at
about
a
hundred
yards
distance
a
tall
girl
in
white
standing
watching
him
things
which
were
not
easily
explainable
always
irritated
him
that
this
place
which
was
his
own
affair
should
present
an
air
of
mystery
did
not
improve
his
humour
which
was
bad
to
begin
with
he
had
lately
been
passing
through
unpleasant
things
which
had
left
him
feeling
himself
tricked
and
made
ridiculous
as
only
women
can
trick
a
man
and
make
him
ridiculous
he
had
said
to
himself
and
there
had
been
an
acrid
consolation
in
looking
forward
to
the
relief
of
venting
one
self
on
a
woman
who
dare
not
resent
what
has
happened
confound
it
he
muttered
when
he
caught
sight
of
the
girl
have
we
set
up
a
house
party
and
then
as
he
saw
more
distinctly
damn
what
a
figure
by
this
time
betty
herself
had
begun
to
see
more
clearly
surely
this
was
a
face
she
remembered
though
the
passing
of
years
and
ugly
living
had
thickened
and
blurred
somewhat
its
always
heavy
features
suddenly
she
knew
it
and
the
look
in
its
eyes
the
look
she
had
as
a
child
unreasoningly
hated
nigel
anstruthers
had
returned
from
his
private
holiday
as
she
took
a
few
quiet
steps
forward
to
meet
him
their
eyes
rested
on
each
other
after
a
night
or
two
in
town
his
were
slightly
bloodshot
and
the
light
in
them
was
not
agreeable
it
was
he
who
spoke
first
and
it
is
possible
that
he
did
not
quite
intend
to
use
the
expletive
which
broke
from
him
but
he
was
remembering
things
also
here
were
eyes
he
too
had
seen
before
twelve
years
ago
in
the
face
of
an
objectionable
child
in
new
york
and
his
own
hatred
of
them
had
been
founded
in
his
own
opinion
on
the
best
of
reasons
and
here
they
gazed
at
him
from
the
face
of
a
young
beauty
for
a
beauty
she
was
damn
it
he
exclaimed
it
is
yes
she
answered
with
a
faint
but
entirely
courteous
smile
it
is
i
hope
you
are
very
she
held
out
her
hand
a
delicious
hand
was
what
he
said
to
himself
as
he
took
it
and
what
eyes
for
a
girl
to
have
in
her
head
were
those
which
looked
out
at
him
between
shadows
was
there
a
hint
of
the
devil
in
them
he
thought
so
he
hoped
so
since
she
had
descended
on
the
place
in
this
way
but
what
the
devil
was
the
meaning
of
her
being
on
the
spot
at
all
he
was
however
far
beyond
the
lack
of
astuteness
which
might
have
permitted
him
to
express
this
last
thought
at
this
particular
juncture
he
was
only
betrayed
into
stupid
mistakes
afterwards
to
be
regretted
when
rage
caused
him
utterly
to
lose
control
of
his
wits
and
though
he
was
startled
and
not
exactly
pleased
he
was
not
in
a
rage
now
the
eyelashes
and
the
figure
gave
an
agreeable
fillip
to
his
humour
howsoever
she
had
come
she
was
worth
looking
at
how
could
one
expect
such
a
delightful
thing
as
this
he
said
with
a
touch
of
ironic
amiability
it
is
more
than
one
it
is
very
polite
of
you
to
say
that
answered
betty
he
was
thinking
rapidly
as
he
stood
and
gazed
at
her
there
were
in
truth
many
things
to
think
of
under
circumstances
so
unexpected
may
i
ask
you
to
excuse
my
staring
at
you
he
inquired
with
what
rosy
had
called
his
awful
agreeable
when
i
saw
you
last
you
were
a
fierce
american
child
i
use
the
word
because
if
you
pardon
my
saying
so
there
was
a
certain
ferocity
about
i
have
learned
at
various
educational
institutions
to
conceal
it
smiled
betty
may
i
ask
when
you
arrived
a
short
time
after
you
went
rosalie
did
not
inform
me
of
your
she
did
not
know
your
address
you
had
forgotten
to
leave
he
had
made
a
mistake
and
realised
it
but
she
presented
to
him
no
air
of
having
observed
his
slip
he
paused
a
few
seconds
still
regarding
her
and
still
thinking
rapidly
he
recalled
the
mended
windows
and
roofs
and
palings
in
the
village
the
park
gates
and
entrance
who
the
devil
had
done
all
that
how
could
a
mere
handsome
girl
be
concerned
in
it
and
yet
here
she
was
when
i
drove
through
the
village
he
said
next
i
saw
that
some
remarkable
changes
had
taken
place
on
my
property
i
feel
as
if
you
can
explain
them
to
i
hope
they
are
changes
which
meet
with
your
quite
quite
a
little
curtly
though
i
confess
they
mystify
me
though
i
am
the
of
an
american
multimillionaire
i
could
not
afford
to
make
such
repairs
a
certain
small
spitefulness
which
was
his
most
frequent
undoing
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
resist
adding
the
innuendo
in
his
last
sentence
and
again
he
saw
it
was
a
folly
the
impersonal
tone
of
her
reply
simply
left
him
where
he
had
placed
himself
we
were
sorry
not
to
be
able
to
reach
you
as
it
seemed
well
to
begin
the
work
at
once
we
consulted
townlinson
we
he
repeated
am
i
to
have
the
pleasure
with
a
slight
wryness
of
the
mouth
of
finding
vanderpoel
also
at
stornham
no
not
yet
as
i
was
on
the
spot
i
saw
your
solicitors
and
asked
their
advice
and
approval
for
my
father
if
he
had
known
how
necessary
the
work
was
it
would
have
been
done
before
for
ughtred
her
voice
was
that
of
a
person
who
in
stating
obvious
facts
provides
no
approach
to
enlightening
comment
upon
them
and
there
was
in
her
manner
the
merest
gracious
impersonality
do
i
understand
that
vanderpoel
employed
someone
to
visit
the
place
and
direct
the
work
it
was
really
not
difficult
to
direct
it
was
merely
a
matter
of
engaging
labour
and
competent
an
odd
expression
rose
in
his
eyes
you
suggest
a
novel
idea
upon
my
word
he
said
is
it
possible
you
see
i
know
something
of
america
is
it
possible
i
must
thank
you
for
the
working
of
this
magic
you
need
not
thank
me
she
said
rather
slowly
because
it
was
necessary
that
she
also
should
think
of
many
things
at
once
i
could
not
have
helped
doing
she
wished
to
make
all
clear
to
him
before
he
met
rosy
she
knew
it
was
not
unnatural
that
the
unexpectedness
of
his
appearance
might
deprive
lady
anstruthers
of
presence
of
mind
instinct
told
her
that
what
was
needed
in
intercourse
with
him
was
above
all
things
presence
of
mind
i
will
tell
you
about
it
she
said
we
will
walk
slowly
up
and
down
here
if
you
do
not
he
did
not
object
he
wanted
to
hear
the
story
as
he
could
not
hear
it
from
his
nervous
little
fool
of
a
wife
who
would
be
frightened
into
forgetting
things
and
their
sequence
what
he
meant
to
discover
was
where
he
stood
in
the
matter
where
his
stood
and
rather
specially
to
have
a
chance
to
sum
up
the
weaknesses
and
strengths
of
the
new
arrival
that
would
be
to
his
interest
in
talking
this
thing
over
she
would
unconsciously
reveal
how
much
vanity
or
emotion
or
inexperience
he
might
count
upon
as
factors
safe
to
use
in
dealings
with
her
in
the
future
as
he
listened
he
was
supported
by
the
fact
that
he
did
not
lose
consciousness
of
the
eyes
and
the
figure
but
for
these
it
is
probable
that
he
would
have
gone
blind
with
fury
at
certain
points
which
forced
themselves
upon
him
the
first
was
that
there
had
been
an
absurd
and
immense
expenditure
which
would
simply
benefit
his
son
and
not
himself
he
could
not
sell
or
borrow
money
on
what
had
been
given
apparently
the
place
had
been
on
a
footing
such
as
it
had
not
rested
upon
during
his
own
generation
or
his
father
as
he
loathed
life
in
the
country
it
was
not
he
who
would
enjoy
its
luxury
but
his
wife
and
her
child
the
second
point
was
that
these
people
this
girl
had
somehow
had
the
sharpness
to
put
themselves
in
the
right
and
to
place
him
in
a
position
at
which
he
could
not
complain
without
putting
himself
in
the
wrong
public
opinion
would
say
that
benefits
had
been
heaped
upon
him
that
the
correct
thing
had
been
done
correctly
with
the
knowledge
and
approval
of
the
legal
advisers
of
his
family
it
had
been
a
masterly
thing
that
visit
to
townlinson
sheppard
he
was
obliged
to
aid
his
by
a
glance
at
the
eyelashes
she
was
a
new
sort
of
girl
this
betty
whose
childhood
he
had
loathed
and
to
his
jaded
taste
novelty
appealed
enormously
her
attraction
for
him
was
also
added
to
by
the
fact
that
he
was
not
at
all
sure
that
there
was
not
combined
with
it
a
pungent
spice
of
the
old
detestation
he
was
repelled
as
well
as
allured
she
represented
things
which
he
hated
first
the
mere
material
power
which
no
man
can
bully
whatsoever
his
humour
it
was
the
power
he
most
longed
for
and
as
he
could
not
hope
to
possess
it
most
sneered
at
and
raged
against
also
as
she
talked
it
was
plain
that
her
habit
of
and
her
sense
of
resource
would
be
difficult
to
deal
with
he
was
a
survival
of
the
type
of
man
whose
simple
creed
was
that
women
should
not
possess
resources
as
when
they
possessed
them
they
could
rarely
be
made
to
behave
themselves
but
while
he
thought
these
things
he
walked
by
her
side
and
both
listened
and
talked
smiling
the
agreeable
smile
you
will
pardon
my
dull
bewilderment
he
said
it
is
not
unnatural
is
it
in
a
mere
outsider
and
betty
with
the
beautiful
impersonal
smile
said
we
felt
it
so
unfortunate
that
even
your
solicitors
did
not
know
your
when
at
length
they
turned
and
strolled
towards
the
house
a
carriage
was
drawing
up
before
the
door
and
at
the
sight
of
it
betty
saw
her
companion
slightly
lift
his
eyebrows
lady
anstruthers
had
been
out
and
was
returning
the
groom
got
down
from
the
box
and
two
appeared
upon
the
steps
lady
anstruthers
descended
laughing
a
little
as
she
talked
to
ughtred
who
had
been
with
her
she
was
dressed
in
clear
pale
grey
and
the
soft
rose
lining
of
her
parasol
warmed
the
colour
of
her
skin
sir
nigel
paused
a
second
and
put
up
his
glass
is
that
my
wife
he
said
really
she
quite
recalls
new
the
agreeable
smile
was
on
his
lips
as
he
hastened
forward
he
always
more
or
less
enjoyed
coming
upon
rosalie
suddenly
the
obvious
result
was
a
pleasing
tribute
to
his
power
betty
following
him
saw
what
occurred
ughtred
saw
him
first
and
spoke
quick
and
low
mother
he
said
the
tone
of
his
voice
was
evidently
enough
lady
anstruthers
turned
with
an
unmistakable
start
the
rose
lining
of
her
parasol
ceased
to
warm
her
colour
in
fact
the
parasol
itself
stepped
aside
and
she
stood
with
a
blank
stiff
white
face
my
dear
rosalie
said
sir
nigel
going
towards
her
you
do
look
very
glad
to
see
he
bent
and
kissed
her
quite
with
the
air
of
a
devoted
husband
knowing
what
the
caress
meant
and
seeing
rosy
face
as
she
submitted
to
it
betty
felt
rather
cold
after
the
conjugal
greeting
he
turned
to
ughtred
you
look
remarkably
well
he
said
betty
came
forward
we
met
in
the
park
rosy
she
explained
we
have
been
talking
to
each
other
for
half
an
the
atmosphere
which
had
surrounded
her
during
the
last
three
months
had
done
much
for
lady
anstruthers
nerves
she
had
the
power
to
recover
herself
sir
nigel
himself
saw
this
when
she
spoke
i
was
startled
because
i
was
not
expecting
to
see
you
she
said
i
thought
you
were
still
on
the
riviera
i
hope
you
had
a
pleasant
journey
i
had
an
extraordinarily
pleasant
surprise
in
finding
your
sister
here
he
answered
and
they
went
into
the
house
in
descending
the
staircase
on
his
way
to
the
before
dinner
sir
nigel
glanced
about
him
with
interested
curiosity
if
the
village
had
been
put
in
order
something
more
had
been
done
here
remembering
the
worn
rugs
and
the
tiger
he
lifted
his
brows
to
leave
one
house
in
a
state
of
resigned
dilapidation
and
return
to
find
it
filled
with
all
such
things
as
comfort
combined
with
excellent
taste
might
demand
was
an
enlivening
experience
or
would
have
been
so
under
some
circumstances
as
matters
stood
perhaps
he
might
have
felt
better
pleased
if
things
had
been
less
well
done
but
they
were
very
well
done
they
had
managed
to
put
themselves
in
the
right
in
this
also
the
rich
sobriety
of
colour
and
form
left
no
opening
for
supercilious
comment
which
was
a
neat
weapon
it
was
annoying
to
be
robbed
of
the
was
fresh
brightly
charming
and
full
of
flowers
betty
was
standing
before
an
open
window
with
her
sister
his
shoulders
he
observed
at
once
had
absolutely
begun
to
suggest
contours
at
all
events
her
bones
no
longer
stuck
out
but
one
did
not
look
at
one
wife
shoulders
when
one
could
turn
from
them
to
a
fairness
of
velvet
and
ivory
you
know
he
said
approaching
them
i
find
all
this
very
amazing
i
have
been
looking
out
of
my
window
on
to
the
it
is
betty
who
has
done
it
all
said
rosy
i
did
not
suspect
you
of
doing
it
my
dear
rosalie
smiling
when
i
saw
betty
standing
in
the
avenue
i
knew
at
once
that
it
was
she
who
had
mended
the
in
the
village
and
rehung
the
for
the
present
at
least
it
was
evident
that
he
meant
to
be
sufficiently
amiable
at
the
dinner
table
he
was
conversational
and
asked
many
questions
professing
a
natural
interest
in
what
had
been
done
it
was
not
difficult
to
talk
to
a
girl
whose
eyes
and
shoulders
combined
themselves
with
a
quick
wit
and
a
power
to
attract
which
he
reluctantly
owned
he
had
never
seen
equalled
his
reluctance
arose
from
the
fact
that
such
a
power
complicated
matters
he
must
be
on
the
defensive
until
he
knew
what
she
was
going
to
do
what
he
must
do
himself
and
what
results
were
probable
or
possible
he
had
spent
his
life
in
intrigue
of
one
order
or
another
he
enjoyed
outwitting
people
and
rather
preferred
to
attain
an
end
by
devious
paths
he
began
every
acquaintance
on
the
defensive
his
argument
was
that
you
never
knew
how
things
would
turn
out
consequently
it
was
as
well
to
conduct
self
at
the
outset
with
the
discreet
forethought
of
a
man
in
the
presence
of
an
enemy
he
did
not
know
how
things
would
turn
out
in
betty
case
and
it
was
a
little
confusing
to
find
one
self
watching
her
with
a
sense
of
excitement
he
would
have
preferred
to
be
cool
to
be
cold
and
he
realised
that
he
could
not
keep
his
eyes
off
her
i
remember
with
regret
he
said
to
her
later
in
the
evening
that
when
you
were
a
child
we
were
i
am
afraid
we
were
was
betty
impartial
answer
i
am
sure
it
was
my
fault
he
said
pray
forget
it
since
you
have
accomplished
such
wonders
will
you
not
in
the
morning
take
me
about
the
place
and
explain
to
me
how
it
has
been
done
when
betty
went
to
her
room
she
dismissed
her
maid
as
soon
as
possible
and
sat
for
some
time
alone
and
waiting
she
had
had
no
opportunity
to
speak
to
rosy
in
private
and
she
was
sure
she
would
come
to
her
in
the
course
of
half
an
hour
she
heard
a
knock
at
the
door
yes
it
was
rosy
and
her
colour
had
fled
and
left
her
looking
dragged
again
she
came
forward
and
dropped
into
a
low
chair
near
betty
letting
her
face
fall
into
her
hands
i
very
sorry
betty
she
half
whispered
but
it
is
no
what
is
no
use
betty
asked
nothing
is
any
use
all
these
years
have
made
me
such
a
coward
i
suppose
i
always
was
a
coward
but
in
the
old
days
there
never
was
anything
to
be
afraid
what
are
you
most
afraid
of
now
i
do
know
that
is
the
worst
i
am
afraid
of
him
just
of
himself
of
the
look
in
his
eyes
of
what
he
may
be
planning
quietly
my
strength
dies
away
when
he
comes
near
what
has
he
said
to
you
she
asked
he
came
into
my
and
sat
and
talked
he
looked
about
from
one
thing
to
another
and
pretended
to
admire
it
all
and
congratulated
me
but
though
he
did
not
sneer
at
what
he
saw
his
eyes
were
sneering
at
me
he
talked
about
you
he
said
that
you
were
a
very
clever
woman
i
do
know
how
he
manages
to
imply
that
a
very
clever
woman
is
something
cunning
and
debased
but
it
means
that
when
he
says
it
it
seems
to
insinuate
things
which
make
one
grow
hot
all
she
put
out
a
hand
and
caught
one
of
betty
betty
betty
she
implored
do
make
him
angry
i
am
not
going
to
begin
by
making
him
angry
betty
said
and
i
do
not
think
he
will
try
to
make
me
angry
at
no
he
will
not
cried
rosalie
and
and
you
remember
what
i
told
you
when
first
we
talked
about
him
and
do
you
remember
was
betty
answer
what
i
said
to
you
when
i
first
met
you
in
the
park
if
we
were
to
cable
to
new
york
this
moment
we
could
receive
an
answer
in
a
few
he
would
not
let
us
do
it
said
rosy
he
would
stop
us
in
some
way
as
he
stopped
my
letters
to
mother
as
he
stopped
me
when
i
tried
to
run
away
oh
betty
i
know
him
and
you
do
i
shall
know
him
better
every
day
that
is
what
i
must
do
i
must
learn
to
know
him
he
said
something
more
to
you
than
you
have
told
me
rosy
what
was
it
he
waited
until
detcham
left
me
lady
anstruthers
confessed
more
than
half
reluctantly
and
then
he
got
up
to
go
away
and
stood
with
his
hands
resting
on
the
chairback
and
spoke
to
me
in
a
low
queer
voice
he
said
try
to
play
any
tricks
on
me
my
good
girl
and
let
your
sister
try
to
play
any
you
would
both
have
reason
to
regret
it
she
was
a
thing
and
betty
watching
her
with
curious
but
tender
eyes
recognised
the
abnormality
ah
if
i
am
a
clever
woman
she
said
he
is
a
clever
man
he
is
beginning
to
see
that
his
power
is
slipping
away
that
was
what
selden
would
call
chapter
xxxi
no
she
would
not
sir
nigel
did
not
invite
rosalie
to
accompany
them
when
the
next
morning
after
breakfast
he
reminded
betty
of
his
suggestion
of
the
night
before
that
she
should
walk
over
the
place
with
him
and
show
him
what
had
been
done
he
preferred
to
make
his
study
of
his
undisturbed
there
was
no
detail
whose
significance
he
missed
as
they
went
about
together
he
had
keen
eyes
and
was
a
quite
sufficiently
practical
person
on
such
matters
as
concerned
his
own
interests
in
this
case
it
was
to
his
interest
to
make
up
his
mind
as
to
what
he
might
gain
or
lose
by
the
appearance
of
his
wife
family
he
did
not
mean
to
lose
if
it
could
be
helped
anything
either
of
personal
importance
or
material
benefit
and
it
could
only
be
helped
by
his
comprehending
clearly
what
he
had
to
deal
with
betty
was
at
present
the
chief
factor
in
the
situation
and
he
was
sufficiently
astute
to
see
that
she
might
not
be
easy
to
read
his
personal
theories
concerning
women
presented
to
him
two
or
three
effective
ways
of
managing
them
you
made
love
to
them
you
flattered
them
either
subtly
or
grossly
you
roughly
or
smoothly
bullied
them
or
you
harrowed
them
with
haughty
indifference
if
your
had
produced
its
proper
effect
when
it
was
necessary
to
lure
or
drive
or
trick
them
into
submission
women
should
be
made
useful
in
one
way
or
another
little
fool
as
she
was
rosalie
had
been
useful
he
had
after
all
was
said
and
done
had
some
comparatively
easy
years
as
the
result
of
her
existence
but
she
had
not
been
useful
enough
and
there
had
even
been
moments
when
he
had
wondered
if
he
had
made
a
mistake
in
separating
her
entirely
from
her
family
there
might
have
been
more
to
be
gained
if
he
had
allowed
them
to
visit
her
and
had
played
the
part
of
a
devoted
husband
in
their
presence
a
great
bore
of
course
but
they
could
not
have
spent
their
entire
lives
at
stornham
twelve
years
ago
however
he
had
known
very
little
of
americans
and
he
had
lost
his
temper
he
was
really
very
fond
of
his
temper
and
rather
enjoyed
referring
to
it
with
tolerant
regret
as
being
a
bad
one
and
beyond
his
control
with
a
manner
which
suggested
that
the
attribute
was
the
inevitable
result
of
strength
of
character
and
masculine
spirit
the
luxury
of
giving
way
to
it
was
a
great
one
and
it
was
exasperating
as
he
walked
about
with
this
handsome
girl
to
find
himself
beginning
to
suspect
that
where
she
was
concerned
some
might
be
necessary
he
was
led
to
this
thought
because
the
things
he
took
in
on
all
sides
could
only
have
been
achieved
by
a
person
whose
mind
was
a
thing
in
one
treatment
of
such
a
creature
methods
must
be
well
chosen
the
crudest
had
sufficed
to
overwhelm
rosalie
he
tried
two
or
three
little
things
as
experiments
during
their
walk
the
first
was
to
touch
with
dignified
pathos
on
the
subject
of
ughtred
betty
he
intimated
gently
could
imagine
what
a
man
grief
and
disappointment
might
be
on
finding
his
son
and
heir
deformed
in
such
a
manner
the
delicate
reserve
with
which
he
managed
to
convey
his
fear
that
rosalie
own
uncontrolled
hysteric
attacks
had
been
the
cause
of
the
misfortune
was
very
well
done
she
had
of
course
been
very
young
and
much
spoiled
and
had
not
learned
poor
girl
it
was
at
this
point
that
betty
first
realised
a
certain
hideous
thing
she
must
actually
remain
silent
there
would
be
at
the
outset
many
times
when
she
could
only
protect
her
sister
by
refraining
from
either
denial
or
argument
if
she
turned
upon
him
now
with
refutation
it
was
rosy
who
would
be
called
upon
to
bear
the
consequences
he
would
go
at
once
to
rosy
and
she
herself
would
have
done
what
she
had
said
she
would
not
do
she
would
have
brought
trouble
upon
the
poor
girl
before
she
was
strong
enough
to
bear
it
she
suspected
also
that
his
intention
was
to
discover
how
much
she
had
heard
and
if
she
might
be
goaded
into
betraying
her
attitude
in
the
matter
but
she
was
not
to
be
so
goaded
he
watched
her
closely
and
her
very
colour
itself
seemed
to
be
under
her
own
control
he
had
expected
if
she
had
heard
hysteric
garbled
stories
from
his
wife
to
see
a
flame
of
scarlet
leap
up
on
the
cheek
he
was
admiring
there
was
no
such
leap
which
was
baffling
in
itself
could
it
be
that
experience
had
taught
rosalie
the
discretion
of
keeping
her
mouth
shut
i
am
very
fond
of
ughtred
was
the
sole
comment
he
was
granted
we
made
friends
from
the
first
as
he
grows
older
and
stronger
his
misfortune
may
be
less
apparent
he
will
be
a
very
clever
he
will
be
a
very
clever
man
if
he
is
at
all
like
he
checked
himself
with
a
slight
movement
of
his
shoulders
i
was
going
to
say
a
thing
utterly
banal
i
beg
your
pardon
i
forgot
for
the
moment
that
i
was
not
talking
to
an
english
it
was
so
stupid
that
she
turned
and
looked
at
him
smiling
faintly
but
her
answer
was
quite
mild
and
soft
do
not
deprive
me
of
compliments
because
i
am
a
mere
american
she
said
i
am
very
fond
of
them
and
respond
at
you
are
very
daring
he
said
looking
straight
into
her
eyes
deliciously
so
american
women
always
are
i
the
young
devil
he
was
saying
internally
the
beautiful
young
devil
she
throws
one
off
the
he
found
himself
more
and
more
attracted
and
exasperated
as
they
made
their
rounds
it
was
his
sense
of
being
attracted
which
was
the
cause
of
his
exasperation
a
girl
who
could
stir
one
like
this
would
be
a
dangerous
enemy
even
as
a
friend
she
would
not
be
safe
because
one
faced
the
absurd
peril
of
losing
one
head
a
little
and
forgetting
the
precautions
one
should
never
lose
sight
of
where
a
woman
was
concerned
the
precautions
which
provided
for
one
holding
a
good
taut
rein
in
one
own
hands
they
went
from
gardens
to
greenhouses
from
greenhouses
to
stables
and
he
was
on
the
watch
for
the
moment
when
she
would
reveal
some
little
feminine
pose
or
vanity
but
this
morning
at
least
she
laid
none
bare
she
did
not
strike
him
as
a
being
of
angelic
perfections
but
she
was
very
modern
and
not
likely
to
show
easily
any
openings
in
her
armour
of
course
i
continue
to
be
amazed
he
commented
though
one
ought
not
to
be
amazed
at
anything
which
evolves
from
your
extraordinary
country
in
spite
of
your
impersonal
air
i
shall
persist
in
regarding
you
as
my
benefactor
but
to
be
frank
i
always
told
rosalie
that
if
she
would
write
to
your
father
he
would
certainly
put
things
in
she
did
write
once
you
will
remember
answered
betty
did
she
with
courteous
vagueness
really
i
am
afraid
i
did
not
hear
of
it
my
poor
wife
has
her
own
little
ideas
about
the
disposal
of
her
and
betty
knew
that
she
was
expected
to
believe
that
rosy
had
hoarded
the
money
sent
to
restore
the
place
and
from
sheer
weak
miserliness
had
allowed
her
son
heritage
to
fall
to
ruin
and
but
for
rosy
sake
she
might
have
stopped
upon
the
path
and
looking
at
him
squarely
have
said
you
are
lying
to
me
and
i
know
the
he
continued
to
converse
amiably
of
course
it
is
you
one
must
thank
not
only
for
rousing
in
the
poor
girl
some
interest
in
her
personal
appearance
but
also
some
interest
in
her
neighbours
some
women
after
they
marry
and
pass
girlhood
seem
to
release
their
hold
on
all
desire
to
attract
or
retain
friends
for
years
rosalie
has
given
herself
up
to
a
chronic
when
the
mistress
of
a
house
is
always
depressed
and
languid
and
does
not
return
visits
neighbours
become
discouraged
and
drop
off
as
it
if
his
wife
had
told
stories
to
gain
her
sympathy
his
companion
would
be
sure
to
lose
her
temper
and
show
her
hand
if
he
could
make
her
openly
lose
her
temper
he
would
have
made
an
advance
one
can
quite
understand
that
she
said
it
is
a
great
happiness
to
me
to
see
rosy
gaining
ground
every
day
she
has
taken
me
out
with
her
a
good
many
times
and
people
are
beginning
to
realise
that
she
likes
to
see
them
at
you
are
very
delightful
he
said
with
your
has
taken
me
out
when
i
glanced
at
the
magnificent
array
of
cards
on
the
salver
in
the
hall
i
realised
a
number
of
things
and
quite
vulgarly
lost
my
breath
the
dunholms
have
been
very
amiable
in
recalling
our
existence
but
charming
americans
of
your
order
arouse
amiable
i
am
very
amiable
myself
said
betty
it
was
he
who
flushed
now
he
was
losing
patience
at
feeling
himself
held
with
such
lightness
at
arm
length
and
at
being
in
spite
of
himself
somehow
compelled
to
continue
to
assume
a
jocular
courtesy
no
you
are
not
he
answered
not
repeated
betty
with
an
incredulous
lifting
of
her
brows
you
are
charming
and
clever
but
i
rather
suspect
you
of
being
a
vixen
at
all
events
you
are
a
spirited
young
woman
and
enough
to
understand
the
attraction
you
must
have
for
the
sordid
and
then
he
became
aware
if
not
of
an
opening
in
her
armour
at
least
of
a
joint
in
it
for
he
saw
near
her
ear
a
deepening
warmth
that
was
it
she
was
and
she
hid
somewhere
a
hot
pride
i
confess
however
he
proceeded
cheerfully
that
notwithstanding
my
own
experience
of
the
habits
of
the
sordid
herd
i
saw
one
card
i
was
surprised
to
find
though
really
shrugging
his
shoulders
i
ought
to
have
been
less
surprised
to
find
it
than
to
find
any
other
but
it
was
bold
i
suppose
the
fellow
is
you
are
speaking
of
suggested
betty
of
mount
dunstan
hang
it
all
it
was
bold
as
if
in
disgust
as
she
had
walked
through
the
garden
paths
betty
had
at
intervals
bent
and
gathered
a
flower
until
she
held
in
one
hand
a
loose
fair
sheaf
at
this
moment
she
stooped
to
break
off
a
spire
of
pale
blue
campanula
and
she
was
as
with
a
shock
struck
with
a
consciousness
that
she
bent
because
she
must
because
to
do
so
was
a
refuge
a
concealment
of
something
she
must
hide
it
had
come
upon
her
without
a
warning
sir
nigel
was
right
she
was
a
vixen
a
virago
she
was
in
such
a
rage
that
her
heart
sprang
up
and
down
and
her
cheek
and
eyes
were
on
fire
her
control
of
herself
was
gone
and
her
shock
was
a
awakening
to
the
fact
that
she
felt
all
this
she
must
hide
her
face
because
it
was
this
one
man
just
this
one
and
no
other
who
was
being
dragged
into
this
thing
with
insult
it
was
an
awakening
and
she
broke
off
rather
slowly
one
two
three
even
four
campanula
stems
before
she
stood
upright
again
as
for
nigel
anstruthers
he
went
on
talking
in
his
disgusted
voice
surely
he
might
count
himself
out
of
the
running
there
will
be
a
good
deal
of
running
my
dear
betty
you
fair
americans
have
learned
that
by
this
time
but
that
a
man
who
has
not
even
a
decent
name
to
offer
who
is
blackballed
by
his
county
should
coolly
present
himself
as
a
pretendant
is
an
insolence
he
should
be
kicked
betty
arranged
her
campanulas
carefully
there
was
no
exterior
reason
why
she
should
draw
sword
in
lord
mount
dunstan
defence
he
had
certainly
not
seemed
to
expect
anything
intimately
interested
from
her
his
manner
she
had
generally
felt
to
be
rather
restrained
but
one
could
in
a
measure
express
one
self
whatsoever
the
she
remarked
no
pretendant
has
complimented
me
by
presenting
himself
so
far
and
lord
mount
dunstan
is
physically
an
unusually
strong
you
mean
it
would
be
difficult
to
kick
him
is
this
partisanship
i
hope
not
am
i
to
understand
he
added
with
deliberation
that
rosalie
has
received
him
here
and
that
you
have
received
him
also
as
you
have
received
lord
westholt
then
i
must
discuss
the
matter
with
rosalie
it
is
not
to
be
discussed
with
you
mean
that
you
will
exercise
your
authority
in
the
matter
in
england
my
dear
girl
the
master
of
a
house
is
still
sometimes
guilty
of
exercising
authority
in
matters
which
concern
the
reputation
of
his
female
relatives
in
the
absence
of
your
father
i
shall
not
allow
you
while
you
are
under
my
roof
to
endanger
your
name
in
any
degree
i
am
at
least
your
brother
by
marriage
i
intend
to
protect
thank
you
said
betty
you
are
young
and
extremely
handsome
you
will
have
an
enormous
fortune
and
you
have
evidently
had
your
own
way
all
your
life
a
girl
such
as
you
are
may
either
make
a
magnificent
marriage
or
a
ridiculous
and
humiliating
one
neither
american
young
women
nor
english
young
men
are
as
disinterested
as
they
were
some
years
ago
each
has
begun
to
learn
what
the
other
has
to
i
think
that
is
true
commented
betty
in
some
cases
there
is
a
good
deal
to
be
exchanged
on
both
sides
you
have
a
great
deal
to
give
and
should
get
exchange
worth
accepting
a
beggared
estate
and
a
tainted
title
are
not
good
that
is
businesslike
betty
made
comment
again
sir
nigel
laughed
quietly
the
fact
is
i
hope
you
wo
misunderstand
my
saying
it
you
do
not
strike
me
as
being
i
am
not
answered
betty
i
thought
not
rather
narrowing
his
eyes
as
he
watched
her
because
he
believed
that
she
must
involuntarily
show
her
hand
if
he
irritated
her
sufficiently
you
do
not
impress
me
as
being
one
of
the
girls
who
make
unsuccessful
marriages
you
are
a
modern
new
york
beauty
not
an
early
victorian
he
did
not
despair
of
results
from
his
process
of
irritation
to
gently
but
steadily
convey
to
a
beautiful
and
spirited
young
creature
that
no
man
could
approach
her
without
ulterior
motive
was
rather
a
good
idea
if
one
could
make
it
clear
with
a
casual
air
of
sensibly
taking
it
for
granted
that
the
natural
power
of
youth
wit
and
beauty
were
rendered
impotent
by
a
greatness
of
fortune
whose
proportions
obliterated
all
else
if
one
simply
argued
from
the
premise
that
young
love
was
no
affair
of
hers
since
she
must
always
be
regarded
as
a
gilded
chattel
whose
cost
was
writ
large
in
plain
figures
what
girl
with
blood
in
her
veins
could
endure
it
long
without
wincing
this
girl
had
undue
and
as
he
regarded
such
matters
unseemly
control
over
her
temper
and
her
nerves
but
she
had
blood
enough
in
her
veins
and
presently
she
would
say
or
do
something
which
would
give
him
a
lead
when
you
marry
he
began
she
lifted
her
head
delicately
but
ended
the
sentence
for
him
with
eyes
which
were
actually
not
unsmiling
when
i
marry
i
shall
ask
something
in
exchange
for
what
i
have
to
if
the
exchange
is
to
be
equal
you
must
ask
a
great
deal
he
answered
that
is
why
you
must
be
protected
from
such
fellows
as
mount
if
it
becomes
necessary
perhaps
i
shall
be
able
to
protect
myself
she
said
ah
regretfully
i
am
afraid
i
have
annoyed
you
and
that
you
need
protection
more
than
you
if
she
were
flesh
and
blood
she
could
scarcely
resist
resenting
the
implication
contained
in
this
but
resist
it
she
did
and
with
a
cool
little
smile
which
stirred
him
to
sudden
if
irritated
admiration
she
paused
a
second
and
used
the
touch
of
gentle
regret
herself
you
have
wounded
my
vanity
by
intimating
that
my
admirers
do
not
love
me
for
myself
he
paused
also
and
narrowing
his
eyes
again
looked
straight
between
her
lashes
they
ought
to
love
you
for
yourself
alone
he
said
in
a
low
voice
you
are
a
deucedly
attractive
oh
betty
rosy
had
pleaded
do
make
him
angry
do
make
him
so
betty
lifted
her
shoulders
slightly
without
comment
shall
we
go
back
to
the
house
now
she
said
rosalie
will
naturally
be
anxious
to
hear
that
what
has
been
done
in
your
absence
has
met
with
your
in
what
manner
his
approval
was
expressed
to
rosalie
betty
did
not
hear
this
morning
at
least
externally
cool
though
she
had
appeared
the
process
had
not
been
without
its
results
and
she
felt
that
she
would
prefer
to
be
alone
i
must
write
some
letters
to
catch
the
next
steamer
she
said
as
she
went
upstairs
when
she
entered
her
room
she
went
to
her
writing
table
and
sat
down
with
pen
and
paper
before
her
she
drew
the
paper
towards
her
and
took
up
the
pen
but
the
next
moment
she
laid
it
down
and
gave
a
slight
push
to
the
paper
as
she
did
so
she
realised
that
her
hand
trembled
i
must
not
let
myself
form
the
habit
of
falling
into
rages
or
i
shall
not
be
able
to
keep
still
some
day
when
i
ought
to
do
it
she
whispered
i
am
in
a
fury
a
and
for
a
moment
she
covered
her
face
she
was
a
strong
girl
but
a
girl
notwithstanding
her
powers
what
she
suddenly
saw
was
that
as
if
by
one
movement
of
some
powerful
unseen
hand
rosy
who
had
been
the
centre
of
all
things
had
been
swept
out
of
her
thought
her
anger
at
the
injustice
done
to
rosy
had
been
as
nothing
before
the
fire
which
had
flamed
in
her
at
the
insult
flung
at
the
other
and
all
that
was
undue
and
unbalanced
one
might
as
well
look
the
thing
straightly
in
the
face
her
old
child
hatred
of
nigel
anstruthers
had
sprung
up
again
in
strength
there
was
it
was
true
something
abominable
about
him
something
which
made
his
words
more
abominable
than
they
would
have
been
if
another
man
had
uttered
them
but
though
it
was
inevitable
that
his
method
should
rouse
one
where
those
of
one
own
blood
were
concerned
it
was
not
enough
to
fill
one
with
raging
flame
when
his
malignity
was
dealing
with
those
who
were
almost
strangers
mount
dunstan
was
almost
a
stranger
she
had
met
lord
westholt
oftener
would
she
have
felt
the
same
hot
beat
of
the
blood
if
lord
westholt
had
been
concerned
no
she
answered
herself
frankly
she
would
not
chapter
xxxii
a
great
ball
a
certain
great
ball
given
yearly
at
dunholm
castle
was
one
of
the
most
notable
social
features
of
the
county
it
took
place
when
the
house
was
full
of
its
most
interestingly
distinguished
guests
and
though
other
balls
might
be
given
at
other
times
this
one
was
marked
by
a
degree
of
greater
state
on
several
occasions
the
chief
guests
had
been
great
personages
indeed
and
to
be
bidden
to
meet
them
implied
a
selection
flattering
in
itself
one
invitation
must
convey
by
inference
that
one
was
either
brilliant
beautiful
or
admirable
if
not
important
nigel
anstruthers
had
never
appeared
at
what
the
uninvited
were
wont
with
derisive
smiles
to
call
the
great
panjandrum
function
which
was
an
ironic
designation
not
employed
by
such
persons
as
received
cards
bidding
them
to
the
festivity
stornham
court
was
not
popular
in
the
county
no
one
had
yearned
for
the
society
of
the
dowager
lady
anstruthers
even
in
her
youth
and
a
not
too
young
man
with
an
temper
noticeably
on
the
lookout
for
grievances
is
not
an
addition
to
one
circle
at
nineteen
nigel
had
discovered
the
older
lord
mount
dunstan
and
his
son
tenham
to
be
congenial
acquaintances
and
had
been
so
often
absent
from
home
that
his
neighbours
would
have
found
social
intercourse
with
him
difficult
even
if
desirable
accordingly
when
the
county
paper
recorded
the
splendours
of
the
great
panjandrum
function
which
it
by
no
means
mentioned
by
that
name
the
list
of
among
those
present
had
not
so
far
contained
the
name
of
sir
nigel
anstruthers
so
on
a
morning
a
few
days
after
his
return
the
master
of
stornham
turned
over
a
card
of
invitation
and
read
it
several
times
before
speaking
i
suppose
you
know
what
this
means
he
said
at
last
to
rosalie
who
was
alone
with
him
it
means
that
we
are
invited
to
dunholm
castle
for
the
ball
it
her
husband
tossed
the
card
aside
on
the
table
it
means
that
betty
will
be
invited
to
every
house
where
there
is
a
son
who
must
be
disposed
of
profitably
she
is
invited
because
she
is
beautiful
and
clever
she
would
be
invited
if
she
had
no
money
at
all
said
rosy
daringly
she
was
actually
growing
daring
she
thought
sometimes
it
would
not
have
been
possible
to
say
anything
like
this
a
few
months
ago
do
make
silly
mistakes
said
nigel
there
are
a
good
many
handsome
girls
who
receive
comparatively
little
attention
but
the
hounds
of
war
are
let
loose
when
one
of
your
swollen
american
fortunes
appears
the
obviousness
of
it
makes
me
sick
it
as
vulgar
as
new
what
befel
next
brought
to
sir
nigel
a
shock
of
curious
enlightenment
but
no
one
was
more
amazed
than
rosy
herself
she
felt
when
she
heard
her
own
voice
as
if
she
must
be
rather
mad
i
would
rather
she
said
quite
distinctly
that
you
did
not
speak
to
me
of
new
york
in
that
what
said
anstruthers
staring
at
her
with
contempt
which
was
derision
it
is
my
home
she
answered
it
is
not
proper
that
i
should
hear
it
spoken
of
your
home
it
has
not
taken
the
slightest
notice
of
you
for
twelve
years
your
people
dropped
you
as
if
you
were
a
hot
they
have
taken
me
up
still
in
amazement
at
her
own
boldness
but
somehow
learning
something
as
she
went
on
he
walked
over
to
her
side
and
stood
before
her
look
here
rosalie
he
said
you
have
been
taking
lessons
from
your
sister
she
is
a
beauty
and
young
and
you
are
not
people
will
stand
things
from
her
they
will
not
take
from
you
i
would
stand
some
things
myself
because
it
rather
amuses
a
man
to
see
a
fine
girl
peacocking
it
merely
ridiculous
in
you
and
i
wo
stand
it
not
a
bit
of
it
was
not
specially
fortunate
for
him
that
the
door
opened
as
he
was
speaking
and
betty
came
in
with
her
own
invitation
in
her
hand
he
was
quick
enough
however
to
turn
to
greet
her
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
i
am
being
favoured
with
a
little
scene
by
my
wife
he
explained
she
is
capable
of
getting
up
excellent
little
scenes
but
i
daresay
she
does
not
show
you
that
side
of
her
betty
took
a
comfortable
easy
chair
her
expression
was
evasively
speculative
was
it
a
scene
i
interrupted
she
said
then
i
must
not
go
away
and
leave
you
to
finish
it
you
were
saying
that
you
would
not
something
what
does
a
man
do
when
he
will
not
a
thing
it
always
sounds
so
final
and
appalling
as
if
he
were
threatening
horrible
things
such
as
perhaps
were
a
resource
in
feudal
times
what
is
the
resource
in
these
dull
days
of
law
and
order
and
policemen
is
this
american
chaff
he
was
disagreeably
conscious
that
he
was
not
wholly
successful
in
his
effort
to
be
lofty
the
frankness
of
betty
smile
was
quite
without
prejudice
dear
me
no
she
said
it
is
only
the
unpicturesque
result
of
an
unfeminine
knowledge
of
the
law
and
i
was
thinking
how
one
is
limited
and
yet
how
things
are
simplified
after
simplified
disgustedly
yes
really
you
see
if
rosy
were
violent
she
could
not
beat
you
even
if
she
were
strong
enough
because
you
could
ring
the
bell
and
give
her
into
custody
and
you
could
not
beat
her
because
the
same
unpleasant
thing
would
happen
to
you
policemen
do
rob
things
of
colour
they
and
besides
when
one
remembers
that
mere
vulgar
law
insists
that
no
one
can
be
forced
to
live
with
another
person
who
is
brutal
or
loathsome
that
simple
is
it
you
could
go
away
from
rosy
with
sweet
clearness
at
any
moment
you
wished
as
far
away
as
you
you
seem
to
forget
still
feeling
that
convincing
loftiness
was
not
easy
that
when
a
man
leaves
his
wife
or
she
deserts
him
it
is
she
who
is
likely
to
be
called
upon
to
bear
the
onus
of
public
would
she
be
called
upon
to
bear
it
under
all
circumstances
damned
clever
woman
as
you
are
you
know
that
she
would
as
well
as
i
know
he
made
an
abrupt
gesture
with
his
hand
you
know
that
what
i
say
is
true
women
who
take
to
their
heels
are
deucedly
unpopular
in
i
have
not
been
long
in
england
but
i
have
been
struck
by
the
prevalence
of
a
sort
of
constitutional
british
sense
of
fair
play
among
the
people
who
really
count
the
dunholms
for
instance
have
it
markedly
in
america
it
is
the
men
who
force
women
to
take
to
their
heels
who
are
deucedly
unpopular
the
americans
sense
of
fair
play
is
their
most
english
quality
it
was
brought
over
in
ships
by
the
first
colonists
like
the
pieces
of
fine
solid
old
furniture
one
even
now
sees
here
and
there
in
houses
in
but
the
fact
remains
said
nigel
with
an
unpleasant
laugh
the
fact
remains
my
dear
the
fact
that
does
remain
said
betty
not
unpleasantly
at
all
and
still
with
her
gentle
air
of
mere
unprejudiced
speculation
is
that
if
a
man
or
woman
is
properly
properly
not
in
any
amateurish
way
they
reach
the
point
of
not
caring
in
the
least
nothing
matters
but
that
they
must
get
away
from
the
horror
of
the
unbearable
thing
never
to
see
or
hear
of
it
again
is
heaven
enough
to
make
anything
else
a
thing
to
smile
at
but
one
could
settle
the
other
point
by
experimenting
suppose
you
run
away
from
rosy
and
then
we
can
see
if
she
is
cut
by
the
his
laugh
was
unpleasant
again
so
long
as
you
are
with
her
she
will
not
be
cut
there
are
a
number
of
penniless
young
men
of
family
in
this
as
well
as
the
adjoining
counties
do
you
think
mount
dunstan
would
cut
her
she
looked
down
at
the
carpet
thoughtfully
a
moment
and
then
lifted
her
eyes
i
do
not
think
so
she
answered
but
i
will
ask
he
was
startled
by
a
sudden
feeling
that
she
might
be
capable
of
it
oh
come
now
he
said
that
goes
beyond
a
joke
you
will
not
do
any
such
absurd
thing
one
does
not
want
one
domestic
difficulties
discussed
by
one
betty
opened
coolly
surprised
eyes
i
did
not
understand
it
was
a
personal
matter
she
remarked
where
do
the
domestic
difficulties
come
in
he
stared
at
her
a
few
seconds
with
the
look
she
did
not
like
which
was
less
likeable
at
the
moment
because
it
combined
itself
with
other
things
hang
it
he
muttered
i
wish
i
could
keep
my
temper
as
you
can
keep
yours
and
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
left
the
room
rosy
had
not
spoken
she
had
sat
with
her
hands
in
her
lap
looking
out
of
the
window
she
had
at
first
had
a
moment
of
terror
she
had
indeed
once
uttered
in
her
soul
the
abject
cry
do
make
him
angry
betty
oh
do
do
and
suddenly
it
had
been
stilled
and
she
had
listened
this
was
because
she
realised
that
nigel
himself
was
listening
that
made
her
see
what
she
had
not
dared
to
allow
herself
to
see
before
these
trite
things
were
true
there
were
laws
to
protect
one
if
betty
had
not
been
dealing
with
mere
truths
nigel
would
have
stopped
her
he
had
been
supercilious
but
he
could
not
contradict
her
betty
she
said
when
her
sister
came
to
her
you
said
that
to
show
me
things
as
well
as
to
show
them
to
him
i
knew
you
did
and
listened
to
every
word
it
was
good
for
me
to
hear
unadorned
facts
are
like
bullets
said
betty
they
reach
home
if
one
aim
is
good
the
shiftiest
people
can
not
evade
a
certain
thing
became
evident
to
betty
during
the
time
which
elapsed
between
the
arrival
of
the
invitations
and
the
great
ball
despite
an
obvious
intention
to
assume
an
amiable
pose
for
the
time
being
sir
nigel
could
not
conceal
a
not
quite
unexplainable
antipathy
to
one
individual
this
individual
was
mount
dunstan
whom
it
did
not
seem
easy
for
him
to
leave
alone
he
seemed
to
recur
to
him
as
a
subject
without
any
special
reason
and
this
somewhat
puzzled
betty
until
she
heard
from
rosalie
of
his
intimacy
with
lord
tenham
which
in
a
measure
explained
it
the
whole
truth
was
that
the
lout
as
he
had
been
called
had
indulged
in
frank
speech
in
his
rare
intercourse
with
his
brother
and
his
friends
and
had
once
interfered
with
hot
young
fury
in
a
matter
in
which
the
pair
had
specially
wished
to
avoid
all
interference
his
open
scorn
of
their
methods
of
entertaining
themselves
they
had
felt
to
be
disgusting
impudence
which
would
have
been
deservedly
punished
with
a
horsewhip
if
the
youngster
had
not
been
a
clumsy
oaf
with
a
dangerous
eye
upon
this
footing
their
acquaintance
had
stood
in
past
years
and
to
decide
as
sir
nigel
had
decided
that
the
oaf
in
question
had
begun
to
make
his
bid
for
splendid
fortune
under
the
roof
of
stornham
court
itself
was
a
thing
not
to
be
regarded
calmly
it
was
more
than
he
could
stand
and
the
folly
of
temper
which
was
forever
his
undoing
betrayed
him
into
mistakes
more
than
once
this
girl
with
her
beauty
and
her
wealth
he
chose
to
regard
as
a
sort
of
property
rightfully
his
own
she
was
his
at
least
she
was
living
under
his
roof
he
had
more
or
less
the
power
to
encourage
or
discourage
such
aspirants
as
appeared
upon
the
whole
there
was
something
soothing
to
one
vanity
in
appearing
before
the
world
as
the
person
at
present
responsible
for
her
it
gave
a
man
a
certain
dignity
of
position
and
his
chief
girding
at
fate
had
always
risen
from
the
fact
that
he
had
not
had
dignity
of
position
he
would
not
be
held
cheap
in
this
matter
at
least
but
sometimes
as
he
looked
at
the
girl
he
turned
hot
and
sick
as
it
was
driven
home
to
him
that
he
was
no
longer
young
that
he
had
never
been
and
that
he
had
cut
the
ground
from
under
his
feet
twelve
years
ago
when
he
had
married
rosalie
if
he
could
have
waited
if
he
could
have
done
several
other
things
perhaps
the
clever
acting
of
a
part
and
his
power
of
domination
might
have
given
him
a
chance
even
that
blackguard
of
a
mount
dunstan
had
a
better
one
now
he
was
young
at
least
and
free
and
a
big
strong
beast
he
was
forced
with
bitter
reluctance
to
admit
that
he
himself
was
not
even
particularly
strong
of
late
he
had
felt
it
hideously
so
he
detested
mount
dunstan
the
more
for
increasing
reasons
as
he
thought
the
matter
over
it
would
seem
perhaps
but
a
subtle
pleasure
to
the
normal
mind
but
to
him
there
was
pleasure
support
aggrandisement
in
referring
to
the
ill
case
of
the
mount
dunstan
estate
in
relating
illustrative
anecdotes
in
dwelling
upon
the
hopelessness
of
the
outlook
and
the
notable
unpopularity
of
the
man
himself
a
confiding
young
lady
from
the
states
was
required
he
said
on
one
occasion
but
it
would
be
necessary
that
she
should
be
a
young
person
of
much
simplicity
who
would
not
be
alarmed
or
chilled
by
the
obvious
no
one
would
realise
this
more
clearly
than
mount
dunstan
himself
he
said
it
coldly
and
casually
as
if
it
were
the
simplest
matter
of
fact
if
the
fellow
had
been
making
himself
agreeable
to
betty
it
was
as
well
that
certain
points
should
be
as
it
were
inadvertently
brought
before
her
miss
vanderpoel
was
really
rather
fine
people
said
to
each
other
afterwards
when
she
entered
the
ballroom
at
dunholm
castle
with
her
she
bore
herself
as
composedly
as
if
she
had
been
escorted
by
the
most
admirable
and
dignified
of
conservative
relatives
instead
of
by
a
man
who
was
more
definitely
disliked
and
disapproved
of
than
any
other
man
in
the
county
whom
decent
people
were
likely
to
meet
yet
she
was
far
too
clever
a
girl
not
to
realise
the
situation
clearly
they
said
to
each
other
she
had
arrived
in
england
to
find
her
sister
a
neglected
wreck
her
fortune
squandered
and
her
existence
stripped
bare
of
even
such
things
as
one
felt
to
be
the
mere
decencies
there
was
but
one
thing
to
be
deduced
from
the
facts
which
had
stared
her
in
the
face
but
of
her
deductions
she
had
said
nothing
whatever
which
was
of
course
remarkable
in
a
young
person
it
may
be
mentioned
that
perhaps
there
had
been
those
who
would
not
have
been
reluctant
to
hear
what
she
must
have
had
to
say
and
who
had
even
possibly
given
her
a
delicate
lead
but
the
lead
had
never
been
taken
one
lady
had
even
remarked
that
on
her
part
she
felt
that
a
too
great
reserve
verged
upon
secretiveness
which
was
not
a
desirable
girlish
quality
of
course
the
situation
had
been
so
much
discussed
that
people
were
naturally
on
the
lookout
for
the
arrival
of
the
stornham
party
as
it
was
known
that
sir
nigel
had
returned
home
and
would
be
likely
to
present
himself
with
his
wife
and
there
was
not
a
dowager
present
who
did
not
know
how
and
where
he
had
reprehensibly
spent
the
last
months
it
served
him
quite
right
that
the
spanish
dancing
person
had
coolly
left
him
in
the
lurch
for
a
younger
and
more
attractive
as
well
as
a
richer
man
if
it
were
not
for
miss
vanderpoel
one
need
not
pretend
that
one
knew
nothing
about
the
affair
in
fact
if
it
had
not
been
for
miss
vanderpoel
he
would
not
have
received
an
invitation
and
poor
lady
anstruthers
would
be
sitting
at
home
still
the
forlorn
little
frump
and
invalid
she
had
so
wonderfully
ceased
to
be
since
her
sister
had
taken
her
in
hand
she
was
absolutely
growing
even
pretty
and
young
and
her
clothes
were
really
beautiful
the
whole
thing
was
amazing
betty
as
well
as
rosalie
and
nigel
knew
that
many
people
turned
undisguisedly
to
look
at
them
even
to
watch
them
as
they
came
into
the
splendid
ballroom
it
was
a
splendid
ballroom
and
a
stately
one
and
lord
dunholm
and
lord
westholt
shared
a
certain
thought
when
they
met
her
which
was
that
hers
was
distinctly
the
proud
young
brilliance
of
presence
which
figured
most
perfectly
against
its
background
much
as
people
wanted
to
look
at
sir
nigel
their
eyes
were
drawn
from
him
to
miss
vanderpoel
after
all
it
was
she
who
made
him
an
object
of
interest
one
wanted
to
know
what
she
would
do
with
him
how
she
would
carry
him
how
much
did
she
know
of
the
distaste
people
felt
for
him
since
she
would
not
talk
or
encourage
talk
the
dunholms
could
not
have
invited
her
and
her
sister
and
have
ignored
him
but
did
she
not
guess
that
they
would
have
ignored
him
if
they
could
and
was
there
not
natural
embarrassment
in
feeling
forced
to
appear
in
pomp
as
it
were
under
his
escort
but
no
embarrassment
was
perceptible
her
manner
committed
her
to
no
recognition
of
a
shadow
of
a
flaw
in
the
character
of
her
companion
it
even
carried
a
certain
conviction
with
it
and
the
felt
the
impossibility
of
suggesting
any
such
flaw
by
their
own
manner
for
this
evening
at
least
the
man
must
actually
be
treated
as
if
he
were
an
entirely
unobjectionable
person
it
appeared
as
if
that
was
what
the
girl
wanted
and
intended
should
happen
this
was
what
nigel
himself
had
begun
to
perceive
but
he
did
not
put
it
pleasantly
deucedly
clever
girl
as
she
was
he
said
to
himself
she
saw
that
it
would
be
more
agreeable
to
have
no
nonsense
talked
and
no
ruffling
of
tempers
he
had
always
been
able
to
convey
to
people
that
the
ruffling
of
his
temper
was
a
thing
to
be
avoided
and
perhaps
she
had
already
been
sharp
enough
to
realise
this
was
a
fact
to
be
counted
with
she
was
sharp
enough
he
said
to
himself
to
see
anything
the
function
was
a
superb
one
the
house
was
superb
the
rooms
of
entertainment
were
in
every
proportion
perfect
and
were
quite
renowned
for
the
beauty
of
the
space
they
offered
the
people
themselves
were
through
centuries
of
dignified
living
so
placed
that
intercourse
with
their
kind
was
an
easy
and
delightful
thing
they
need
never
doubt
either
their
own
effect
or
the
effect
of
their
hospitalities
sir
nigel
saw
about
him
all
the
people
who
held
enviable
place
in
the
county
some
of
them
he
had
never
known
some
of
them
had
long
ceased
to
recall
his
existence
there
were
those
among
them
who
lifted
lorgnettes
or
stuck
monocles
into
their
eyes
as
he
passed
asking
each
other
in
politely
subdued
tones
who
the
man
was
who
seemed
to
be
in
attendance
on
miss
vanderpoel
nigel
knew
this
and
girded
at
it
internally
while
he
made
the
most
of
his
suave
smile
the
distinguished
personage
who
was
the
chief
guest
was
to
be
seen
at
the
upper
end
of
the
room
talking
to
a
tall
man
with
broad
shoulders
who
was
plainly
interesting
him
for
the
moment
as
the
stornham
party
passed
on
this
person
making
his
bow
retired
and
as
he
turned
towards
them
sir
nigel
recognising
him
the
agreeable
smile
was
for
the
moment
lost
how
in
the
name
of
heaven
did
mount
dunstan
come
here
broke
from
him
with
involuntary
heat
would
it
be
rash
to
conclude
said
betty
as
she
returned
the
bow
of
a
very
grand
old
lady
in
black
velvet
and
an
imposing
tiara
that
he
came
in
response
to
invitation
the
very
grand
old
lady
seemed
pleased
to
see
her
and
with
a
royal
little
sign
called
her
to
her
side
as
betty
vanderpoel
was
a
great
success
with
the
weldens
and
old
dobys
of
village
life
she
was
also
a
success
among
grand
old
ladies
when
she
stood
before
them
there
was
a
delicate
submission
in
her
air
which
was
suggestive
of
obedience
to
the
dignity
of
their
years
and
state
strongly
conservative
and
rather
feudal
old
persons
were
much
pleased
by
this
in
the
present
irreverent
iconoclasm
of
modern
times
it
was
most
agreeable
to
talk
to
a
handsome
creature
who
was
as
beautifully
attentive
as
if
she
had
been
a
specially
perfect
young
this
one
even
patted
betty
hand
a
little
when
she
took
it
she
was
a
great
county
potentate
who
was
known
as
lady
alanby
of
dole
her
house
being
one
of
the
most
ancient
and
interesting
in
england
i
am
glad
to
see
you
here
she
said
you
are
looking
very
nice
but
you
can
not
help
betty
asked
permission
to
present
her
sister
and
lady
alanby
was
polite
to
both
of
them
but
she
gave
nigel
a
rather
sharp
glance
through
her
gold
as
she
greeted
him
janey
and
mary
she
said
to
the
two
girls
nearest
her
i
daresay
you
will
kindly
change
your
chairs
and
let
lady
anstruthers
and
miss
vanderpoel
sit
next
to
the
ladies
jane
and
mary
lithcom
who
had
been
ordered
about
by
her
from
their
infancy
obeyed
with
polite
smiles
they
were
not
particularly
pretty
girls
and
were
of
the
indigent
noble
jane
who
had
almost
overlarge
blue
eyes
sighed
as
she
reseated
herself
a
few
chairs
lower
down
it
does
seem
beastly
unfair
she
said
in
a
low
voice
to
her
sister
that
a
girl
such
as
that
should
be
so
awfully
she
ought
to
have
a
thank
you
said
mary
i
have
a
nose
myself
and
i
got
nothing
to
balance
oh
i
did
mean
a
nice
nose
like
yours
said
jane
i
meant
an
ugly
one
of
course
lady
alanby
wants
her
for
and
her
manner
was
not
resigned
what
she
or
anyone
else
for
that
matter
disdainfully
could
want
with
tommy
i
do
know
replied
mary
i
do
answered
jane
obstinately
i
played
cricket
with
him
when
i
was
eight
and
i
liked
him
ever
since
it
is
awful
in
a
smothered
outburst
what
girls
like
us
have
to
lady
mary
turned
to
look
at
her
curiously
jane
she
said
are
you
suffering
about
tommy
yes
i
am
oh
what
a
question
to
ask
in
a
ballroom
do
you
want
me
to
burst
out
crying
no
sharply
look
at
the
prince
stare
at
that
fat
woman
curtsying
to
him
stare
and
then
wink
your
lady
alanby
was
talking
about
mount
dunstan
lord
dunholm
has
given
us
a
lead
he
is
an
old
friend
of
mine
and
he
has
been
talking
to
me
about
it
it
appears
that
he
has
been
looking
into
things
seriously
modern
as
he
is
he
rather
tilts
at
injustices
in
a
quiet
way
he
has
satisfactorily
convinced
himself
that
lord
mount
dunstan
has
been
suffering
for
the
sins
of
the
fathers
which
must
be
is
lord
dunholm
quite
sure
of
that
put
in
sir
nigel
with
a
suggestively
civil
air
old
lady
alanby
gave
him
an
unencouraging
look
quite
she
said
he
would
be
likely
to
be
before
he
took
any
ah
remarked
nigel
i
knew
lord
tenham
you
lady
alanby
look
was
more
unencouraging
still
she
quietly
and
openly
put
up
her
glass
and
stared
there
were
times
when
she
had
not
the
remotest
objection
to
being
rude
to
certain
people
i
am
sorry
to
hear
that
she
observed
there
never
was
any
room
for
mistake
about
tenham
he
is
not
usually
i
do
not
think
this
man
would
be
usually
mentioned
if
everything
were
known
said
nigel
then
an
appalling
thing
happened
lady
alanby
gazed
at
him
a
few
seconds
and
made
no
reply
whatever
she
dropped
her
glass
and
turned
again
to
talk
to
betty
it
was
as
if
she
had
turned
her
back
on
him
and
sir
nigel
still
wearing
an
amiable
exterior
used
internally
some
bad
language
but
i
was
a
fool
to
speak
of
tenham
he
thought
a
great
a
little
later
miss
vanderpoel
made
her
curtsy
to
the
exalted
guest
and
was
commented
upon
again
by
those
who
looked
on
it
was
not
at
all
unnatural
that
one
should
find
ones
eyes
following
a
girl
who
representing
a
sort
of
royal
power
should
have
the
good
fortune
of
possessing
such
looks
and
bearing
remembering
his
child
bete
noir
of
the
long
legs
and
square
audacious
little
face
nigel
anstruthers
found
himself
restraining
a
slight
grin
as
he
looked
on
at
her
dancing
partners
flocked
about
her
like
bees
and
lady
alanby
of
dole
and
other
very
grand
old
or
ladies
all
found
the
evening
more
interesting
because
they
could
watch
her
she
is
full
of
spirit
said
lady
alanby
and
she
enjoys
herself
as
a
girl
should
it
is
a
pleasure
to
look
at
her
i
like
a
girl
who
gets
a
magnificent
colour
and
stars
in
her
eyes
when
she
dances
it
looks
healthy
and
it
was
tommy
miss
vanderpoel
was
dancing
with
when
her
ladyship
said
this
tommy
was
her
grandson
and
a
young
man
of
greater
rank
than
fortune
he
was
a
nice
frank
heavy
youth
who
loved
a
simple
county
life
spent
in
tramping
about
with
guns
and
in
friendly
hobnobbing
with
the
neighbours
and
eating
great
afternoon
teas
with
people
whose
jokes
were
easy
to
understand
and
who
were
ready
to
laugh
if
you
tried
a
joke
yourself
he
liked
girls
and
especially
he
liked
jane
lithcom
but
that
was
a
weakness
his
grandmother
did
not
at
all
encourage
and
as
he
danced
with
betty
vanderpoel
he
looked
over
her
shoulder
more
than
once
at
a
pair
of
big
unhappy
blue
eyes
whose
owner
sat
against
the
wall
betty
vanderpoel
herself
was
not
thinking
of
tommy
in
fact
during
this
brilliant
evening
she
faced
still
further
developments
of
her
own
strange
case
certain
new
things
were
happening
to
her
when
she
had
entered
the
ballroom
she
had
known
at
once
who
the
man
was
who
stood
before
the
royal
guest
she
had
known
before
he
bowed
low
and
withdrew
and
her
recognition
had
brought
with
it
a
shock
of
joy
for
a
few
moments
her
throat
felt
hot
and
pulsing
it
was
true
the
things
which
concerned
him
concerned
her
all
that
happened
to
him
suddenly
became
her
affair
as
if
in
some
way
they
were
of
the
same
blood
slighting
of
him
had
infuriated
her
that
lord
dunholm
had
offered
him
friendship
and
hospitality
was
a
thing
which
seemed
done
to
herself
and
filled
her
with
gratitude
and
affection
that
he
should
be
at
this
place
on
this
special
occasion
swept
away
dark
things
from
his
path
it
was
as
if
it
were
stated
without
words
that
a
conservative
man
of
the
world
who
knew
things
as
they
were
having
means
of
reaching
truths
vouched
for
him
and
placed
his
dignity
and
firmness
at
his
side
and
there
was
the
gladness
at
the
sight
of
him
it
was
an
overpoweringly
strong
thing
she
had
never
known
anything
like
it
she
had
not
seen
him
since
nigel
return
and
here
he
was
and
she
knew
that
her
life
quickened
in
her
because
they
were
together
in
the
same
room
he
had
come
to
them
and
said
a
few
courteous
words
but
he
had
soon
gone
away
at
first
she
wondered
if
it
was
because
of
nigel
who
at
the
time
was
making
himself
rather
ostentatiously
amiable
to
her
afterwards
she
saw
him
dancing
talking
being
presented
to
people
being
with
a
tactful
easiness
taken
care
of
by
his
host
and
hostess
and
lord
westholt
she
was
struck
by
the
graceful
magic
with
which
this
tactful
ease
surrounded
him
without
any
obviousness
the
dunholms
had
given
a
lead
as
lady
alanby
had
said
and
the
rest
were
following
it
and
ignoring
intervals
with
reposeful
readiness
it
was
wonderfully
well
done
apparently
there
had
been
no
past
at
all
all
began
with
this
large
young
man
who
despite
his
viking
type
really
looked
particularly
well
in
evening
dress
lady
alanby
held
him
by
her
chair
for
some
time
openly
enjoying
her
talk
with
him
and
calling
up
tommy
that
they
might
make
friends
after
a
while
betty
said
to
herself
he
would
come
and
ask
for
a
dance
but
he
did
not
come
and
she
danced
with
one
man
after
another
westholt
came
to
her
several
times
and
had
more
dances
than
one
why
did
the
other
not
come
several
times
they
whirled
past
each
other
and
when
it
occurred
they
looked
both
feeling
it
an
accident
into
each
eyes
the
strong
and
strange
thing
that
which
moves
on
its
way
as
do
birth
and
death
and
the
rising
and
setting
of
the
sun
had
begun
to
move
in
them
it
was
no
new
and
rare
thing
but
an
ancient
and
common
one
as
common
and
ancient
as
death
and
birth
themselves
and
part
of
the
law
as
they
are
as
it
comes
to
royal
persons
to
whom
one
makes
obeisance
at
their
mere
passing
by
as
it
comes
to
scullery
maids
in
royal
kitchens
and
grooms
in
royal
stables
as
it
comes
to
and
the
women
who
serve
them
so
it
had
come
to
these
two
who
had
been
drawn
near
to
each
other
from
the
opposite
sides
of
the
earth
and
each
started
at
the
touch
of
it
and
withdrew
a
pace
in
bewilderment
and
some
fear
i
wish
mount
dunstan
was
feeling
throughout
the
evening
that
her
eyes
had
some
fault
in
their
expression
that
they
drew
one
less
that
they
drew
me
less
i
am
losing
my
it
would
be
better
betty
thought
if
i
did
not
wish
so
much
that
he
would
come
and
ask
me
to
dance
with
him
that
he
would
not
keep
away
so
he
is
keeping
away
for
a
reason
why
is
he
doing
it
the
music
swung
on
in
lovely
measures
and
the
dancers
swung
with
it
sir
nigel
walked
dutifully
through
the
lancers
once
with
his
wife
and
once
with
his
beautiful
lady
anstruthers
in
her
new
bloom
had
not
lacked
partners
who
discovered
that
she
was
a
childishly
light
creature
who
danced
extremely
well
everyone
was
kind
to
her
and
the
very
grand
old
ladies
who
admired
betty
were
absolutely
benign
in
their
manner
betty
partners
paid
ingenuous
court
to
her
and
sir
nigel
found
he
had
not
been
mistaken
in
his
estimate
of
the
dignity
his
position
of
escort
and
male
relation
gave
to
him
rosy
standing
for
a
moment
looking
out
on
the
brilliancy
and
state
about
her
meeting
betty
eyes
laughed
quiveringly
i
am
in
a
dream
she
said
you
have
awakened
from
a
dream
betty
answered
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
someone
was
coming
towards
them
and
seeing
him
rosy
smiled
in
welcome
i
am
sure
lord
mount
dunstan
is
coming
to
ask
you
to
dance
with
him
she
said
why
have
you
not
danced
with
him
before
betty
he
has
not
asked
me
betty
answered
that
is
the
only
lord
dunholm
and
lord
westholt
called
at
the
mount
a
few
days
after
they
met
him
at
stornham
rosalie
explained
in
an
undertone
they
wanted
to
know
him
then
it
seems
they
found
they
liked
each
other
lady
dunholm
has
been
telling
me
about
it
she
says
lord
dunholm
thanks
you
because
you
said
something
illuminating
that
was
the
word
she
used
i
believe
you
are
always
illuminating
mount
dunstan
was
certainly
coming
to
them
how
broad
his
shoulders
looked
in
his
black
coat
how
well
built
his
whole
strong
body
was
and
how
steadily
he
held
his
eyes
here
and
there
one
sees
a
man
or
woman
who
is
through
some
trick
of
fate
by
nature
a
compelling
thing
unconsciously
demanding
that
one
should
submit
to
some
domineering
attraction
one
does
not
call
it
domineering
but
it
is
so
this
special
creature
is
charged
unfairly
with
more
than
his
or
her
single
share
of
force
betty
vanderpoel
thought
this
out
as
this
other
one
came
to
her
he
did
not
use
the
ballroom
formula
when
he
spoke
to
her
he
said
in
rather
a
low
voice
will
you
dance
with
me
yes
she
answered
lord
dunholm
and
his
wife
agreed
afterwards
that
so
noticeable
a
pair
had
never
before
danced
together
in
their
ballroom
certainly
no
pair
had
ever
been
watched
with
quite
the
same
interested
curiosity
some
onlookers
thought
it
singular
that
they
should
dance
together
at
all
some
pleased
themselves
by
reflecting
on
the
fact
that
no
other
two
could
have
represented
with
such
picturesqueness
the
opposite
poles
of
fate
and
circumstance
no
one
attempted
to
deny
that
they
were
an
extraordinarily
couple
and
that
one
eyes
followed
them
in
spite
of
one
self
taken
together
they
produce
an
effect
that
is
somehow
rather
amazing
old
lady
alanby
commented
he
is
a
magnificently
built
man
you
know
and
she
is
a
magnificently
built
girl
everybody
should
look
like
that
my
impression
would
be
that
adam
and
eve
did
but
for
the
fact
that
neither
of
them
had
any
particular
character
that
affair
of
the
apple
was
so
silly
eve
has
always
struck
me
as
being
the
kind
of
woman
who
if
she
lived
would
run
up
stupid
bills
at
her
dressmakers
and
be
afraid
to
tell
her
husband
that
wonderful
black
head
of
miss
vanderpoel
looks
very
nice
poised
near
mount
dunstan
dark
red
i
am
glad
to
be
dancing
with
him
betty
was
thinking
i
am
glad
to
be
near
will
you
dance
this
with
me
to
the
very
end
asked
mount
dunstan
to
the
very
late
note
yes
answered
betty
he
had
spoken
in
a
low
but
level
voice
the
kind
of
voice
whose
tone
places
a
man
and
woman
alone
together
and
wholly
apart
from
all
others
by
whomsoever
they
are
surrounded
there
had
been
no
preliminary
speech
and
no
explanation
of
the
request
followed
the
music
was
a
perfect
thing
the
brilliant
lofty
ballroom
the
beauty
of
colour
and
sound
about
them
the
jewels
and
fair
faces
the
warm
breath
of
flowers
in
the
air
the
very
sense
of
royal
presence
and
its
accompanying
state
and
ceremony
seemed
merely
a
naturally
arranged
background
for
the
strange
consciousness
each
held
close
and
silently
knowing
nothing
of
the
mind
of
the
other
this
was
what
was
passing
through
the
man
mind
this
is
the
thing
which
most
men
experience
several
times
during
their
lives
it
would
be
reason
enough
for
all
the
great
deeds
and
all
the
crimes
one
hears
of
it
is
an
enormous
kind
of
anguish
and
a
fearful
kind
of
joy
it
is
scarcely
to
be
borne
and
yet
at
this
moment
i
could
kill
myself
and
her
at
the
thought
of
losing
it
if
i
had
begun
earlier
would
it
have
been
easier
no
it
would
not
with
me
it
is
bound
to
go
hard
at
twenty
i
should
probably
not
have
been
able
to
keep
myself
from
shouting
it
aloud
and
i
should
not
have
known
that
it
was
only
the
working
of
the
law
good
god
what
a
fool
i
am
it
is
because
it
is
only
the
law
that
i
can
not
escape
and
must
go
on
to
the
end
grinding
my
teeth
together
because
i
can
not
speak
oh
her
smooth
young
cheek
oh
the
deep
shadows
of
her
lashes
and
while
we
sway
round
and
round
together
i
hold
her
slim
strong
body
in
the
hollow
of
my
it
was
quite
possibly
as
he
thought
this
that
nigel
anstruthers
following
him
with
his
eyes
as
he
passed
began
to
frown
he
had
been
watching
the
pair
as
others
had
he
had
seen
what
others
saw
and
now
he
had
an
idea
that
he
saw
something
more
and
it
was
something
which
did
not
please
him
the
instinct
of
the
male
bestirred
itself
the
curious
instinct
of
resentment
against
another
man
any
other
man
and
in
this
case
mount
dunstan
was
not
any
other
man
but
one
for
whom
his
antipathy
was
personal
i
wo
have
that
he
said
to
himself
i
wo
have
the
music
rose
and
swelled
and
then
sank
into
soft
breathing
as
they
moved
in
harmony
together
gliding
and
swirling
as
they
threaded
their
way
among
other
couples
who
swirled
and
glided
also
some
of
them
light
and
smiling
some
exchanging
speech
perhaps
saying
words
which
unheard
by
others
touched
on
deep
things
the
exalted
guest
fell
into
momentary
silence
as
he
looked
on
being
a
man
much
attracted
by
physical
fineness
and
temperamental
power
and
charm
a
girl
like
that
would
bring
a
great
deal
to
a
man
and
to
the
country
he
belonged
to
a
great
race
might
be
founded
on
such
superbness
of
physique
and
health
and
beauty
combined
with
abnormal
resources
certainly
no
more
could
be
asked
he
expressed
something
of
the
kind
to
lord
dunholm
who
stood
near
him
in
attendance
to
herself
betty
was
saying
that
was
a
strange
thing
he
asked
me
it
is
curious
that
we
say
so
little
i
should
never
know
much
about
him
i
have
no
intelligence
where
he
is
concerned
only
a
strong
stupid
feeling
which
is
not
like
a
feeling
of
my
own
i
am
no
longer
betty
vanderpoel
and
i
wish
to
go
on
dancing
with
him
on
and
on
to
the
last
note
as
he
she
felt
a
little
hot
wave
run
over
her
cheek
uncomfortably
and
the
next
instant
the
big
arm
tightened
its
clasp
of
her
for
just
one
second
not
more
than
one
she
did
not
know
that
he
himself
had
seen
the
sudden
ripple
of
red
colour
and
that
the
equally
sudden
contraction
of
the
arm
had
been
as
unexpected
to
him
and
as
involuntary
as
the
quick
wave
itself
it
had
horrified
and
made
him
angry
he
looked
the
next
instant
entirely
stiff
and
cold
he
did
not
know
it
happened
betty
resolved
the
music
is
going
to
stop
said
mount
dunstan
i
know
the
waltz
we
can
get
once
round
the
room
again
before
the
final
chord
it
was
to
be
the
last
note
the
very
last
but
he
said
it
quite
rigidly
and
betty
laughed
quite
the
last
she
answered
the
music
hastened
a
little
and
their
gliding
whirl
became
more
rapid
a
little
faster
a
little
faster
still
a
running
sweep
of
notes
a
big
terminating
harmony
and
the
thing
was
over
thank
you
said
mount
dunstan
one
will
have
it
to
and
his
tone
was
slightly
sardonic
yes
betty
acquiesced
politely
oh
not
you
only
i
have
never
waltzed
betty
turned
to
look
at
him
curiously
under
circumstances
such
as
these
he
explained
i
learned
to
dance
at
a
particularly
hideous
boys
school
in
france
i
abhorred
it
and
the
trend
of
my
life
has
made
it
quite
easy
for
me
to
keep
my
vow
that
i
would
never
dance
after
i
left
the
place
unless
i
wanted
to
do
it
and
that
especially
nothing
should
make
me
waltz
until
certain
agreeable
conditions
were
fulfilled
waltzing
i
approved
of
out
of
hideous
schools
i
was
a
objectionable
child
i
detested
myself
even
betty
composure
returned
to
her
i
am
trusting
she
remarked
that
i
may
secretly
regard
myself
as
one
of
the
agreeable
conditions
to
be
fulfilled
do
not
dispel
my
hopes
i
will
not
he
answered
you
are
in
fact
several
of
one
breathes
with
much
greater
freedom
she
responded
this
sort
of
cool
nonsense
was
safe
it
dispelled
feelings
of
tenseness
and
carried
them
to
the
place
where
sir
nigel
and
lady
anstruthers
awaited
them
a
slight
stir
was
beginning
to
be
felt
throughout
the
ballroom
the
royal
guest
was
retiring
and
soon
the
rest
began
to
melt
away
the
anstruthers
who
had
a
long
return
drive
before
them
were
among
those
who
went
first
when
lady
anstruthers
and
her
sister
returned
from
the
cloak
room
they
found
sir
nigel
standing
near
mount
dunstan
who
was
going
also
and
talking
to
him
in
an
amiably
detached
manner
mount
dunstan
himself
did
not
look
amiable
or
seem
to
be
saying
much
but
sir
nigel
showed
no
signs
of
being
disturbed
now
that
you
have
ceased
to
forswear
the
world
he
said
as
his
wife
approached
i
hope
we
shall
see
you
at
stornham
your
visits
must
not
cease
because
we
can
not
offer
you
selden
any
he
had
his
own
reasons
for
giving
the
invitation
several
of
them
and
there
was
a
satisfaction
in
letting
the
fellow
know
casually
that
he
was
not
in
the
ridiculous
position
of
being
unaware
of
what
had
occurred
during
his
absence
that
there
had
been
visits
and
also
the
objectionable
episode
of
the
american
bounder
that
the
episode
had
been
objectionable
he
knew
he
had
adroitly
conveyed
by

mount
dunstan
thanked
him
in
the
usual
formula
and
then
spoke
to
betty
g
selden
left
us
tremulous
and
fevered
with
ecstatic
anticipation
he
carried
your
kind
letter
to
vanderpoel
next
to
his
heart
his
brain
seemed
to
whirl
at
the
thought
of
what
boys
would
say
when
he
arrived
with
it
in
new
york
you
have
materialised
the
dream
of
his
life
i
have
interested
my
father
betty
answered
with
a
brilliant
smile
he
liked
the
romance
of
the
reuben

who
rewarded
the
saver
of
his
life
by
unbounded
orders
for
the

bent
forward
to
look
out
of
the
window
and
having
done
it
laughed
a
little
mount
dunstan
does
not
play
the
game
well
he
remarked
it
was
annoying
that
neither
betty
nor
his
wife
inquired
what
the
game
in
question
might
be
and
that
his
temperament
forced
him
into
explaining
without
encouragement
he
should
have
motionless
with
folded
arms
or
something
of
the
sort
and
her
equipage
until
it
was
out
of
sight
and
he
did
not
said
betty
he
turned
on
his
heel
as
soon
as
the
door
was

not

her
simple
comment
to

it
seemed

chapter
xxxiii
for
lady
jane
there
is
no
one
thing
on
earth
of
such
interest
as
the
study
of
the
laws
of
temperament
which
impel
support
or
entrap
into
folly
and
danger
the
being
they
rule
as
a
child
not
old
enough
to
give
a
definite
name
to
the
thing
she
watched
and
pondered
on
in
child
fashion
bettina
vanderpoel
had
thought
much
on
this
subject
as
she
had
grown
older
she
had
never
been
ignorant
of
the
workings
of
her
own
temperament
and
she
had
looked
on
for
years
at
the
laws
which
had
wrought
in
her
being
the
laws
of
strength
executive
capacity
and
that
pleasure
in
great
schemes
which
is
roused
less
by
a
desire
for
gain
than
for
a
necessity
for
action
resulting
in
success
she
mentally
followed
other
people
on
their
way
sometimes
asking
herself
how
far
the
individual
was
to
be
praised
or
blamed
for
his
treading
of
the
path
he
seemed
to
choose
and
now
there
was
given
her
the
opportunity
to
study
the
workings
of
the
nature
of
nigel
anstruthers
which
was
a
curious
thing
he
was
not
an
individual
to
be
envied
never
was
man
more
tormented
by
lack
of
power
to
control
his
special
devil
at
the
right
moment
of
time
and
therefore
never
was
there
one
so
inevitably
his
own
frustration
this
betty
saw
after
the
passing
of
but
a
few
days
and
wondered
how
far
he
was
conscious
or
unconscious
of
the
thing
at
times
it
appeared
to
her
that
he
was
in
a
state
of
unrest
that
he
was
as
a
man
wavering
between
lines
of
action
swayed
at
one
moment
by
one
thought
at
another
by
an
idea
quite
different
and
that
he
was
harried
because
he
could
not
hold
his
own
with
himself
this
was
true
the
ball
at
dunholm
castle
had
been
enlightening
and
had
wrought
some
changes
in
his
points
of
view
also
other
factors
had
influenced
him
in
the
first
place
the
changed
atmosphere
of
stornham
the
fitness
and
luxury
of
his
surroundings
the
new
dignity
given
to
his
position
by
the
altered
aspect
of
things
rendered
external
amiability
more
easy
to
ride
about
the
country
on
a
good
horse
or
drive
in
a
smart
phaeton
or
suitable
carriage
and
to
find
that
people
who
a
year
ago
had
passed
him
with
the
merest
recognition
saluted
him
with
polite
intention
was
to
a
certain
degree
stimulating
to
a
vanity
which
had
been
long
the
power
which
produced
these
results
should
of
course
have
been
in
his
own
hands
his
should
have
seen
that
it
was
his
affair
to
provide
for
that
but
since
he
had
not
done
so
it
was
rather
entertaining
that
it
should
be
for
the
present
in
the
hands
of
this
extraordinarily
girl
he
had
begun
by
merely
thinking
of
her
in
this
manner
as
this
extraordinarily
girl
and
had
not
for
a
moment
hesitated
before
the
edifying
idea
of
its
not
being
impossible
to
arrange
a
lively
flirtation
with
her
she
was
at
an
age
when
in
his
opinion
girlhood
was
poised
for
flight
with
adventure
and
his
tastes
had
not
led
him
in
the
direction
of
youth
which
was
fastidious
his
riviera
episode
had
left
his
vanity
blistered
and
requiring
some
soothing
application
his
life
had
worked
evil
with
him
and
he
had
fallen
ill
on
the
hands
of
a
woman
who
had
treated
him
as
a
shattered
useless
thing
whose
day
was
done
and
with
whom
strength
and
bloom
could
not
be
burdened
he
had
kept
his
illness
a
hidden
secret
on
his
return
to
stornham
his
one
desire
having
been
to
forget
even
to
disbelieve
in
it
but
dreams
of
its
suggestion
sometimes
awakened
him
at
night
with
shudders
and
cold
sweat
he
was
hideously
afraid
of
death
and
pain
and
he
had
had
monstrous
pain
and
while
he
had
lain
battling
with
it
upon
his
bed
in
the
villa
on
the
mediterranean
he
had
been
able
to
hear
in
the
garden
outside
the
low
voices
and
laughter
of
the
spanish
dancer
and
the
healthy
strong
young
fool
who
was
her
new
adorer
when
he
had
found
himself
face
to
face
with
betty
in
the
avenue
after
the
first
leap
of
annoyance
which
had
suddenly
died
down
into
perversely
interested
curiosity
he
could
have
laughed
outright
at
the
novelty
and
odd
unexpectedness
of
the
situation
the
little
new
york
beast
had
developed
into
this
hang
it
no
man
could
guess
what
the
embryo
female
creature
might
result
in
his
mere
shakiness
of
physical
condition
added
strength
to
her
attraction
she
was
like
a
young
goddess
of
health
and
life
and
fire
the
very
spring
of
her
firm
foot
upon
the
moss
beneath
it
was
a
stimulating
thing
to
a
man
whose
nerves
sprung
secret
fears
upon
him
there
were
sparks
between
the
sweep
of
her
lashes
but
she
managed
to
carry
herself
with
the
air
of
being
as
cool
as
a
cucumber
which
gave
spice
to
the
effort
to
upset
her
if
she
did
not
prove
suitably
amenable
there
would
be
piquancy
in
getting
the
better
of
her
in
stirring
up
unpleasant
little
things
which
would
make
it
easier
for
her
to
go
away
than
remain
on
the
spot
if
one
should
end
by
choosing
to
get
rid
of
her
but
for
the
moment
he
had
no
desire
to
get
rid
of
her
he
wanted
to
see
what
she
intended
to
do
to
see
the
thing
out
in
fact
it
amused
him
to
hear
that
mount
dunstan
was
on
her
track
there
exists
for
persons
of
a
certain
type
a
pleasure
by
the
mere
sense
of
having
got
even
with
an
opponent
throughout
his
life
he
had
made
a
point
of
getting
even
with
those
who
had
irritatingly
crossed
his
path
or
much
disliked
him
the
working
out
of
small
or
large
plans
to
achieve
this
end
had
formed
one
of
his
most
agreeable
recreations
he
had
long
owed
mount
dunstan
a
debt
which
he
had
always
meant
to
pay
he
had
not
intended
to
forget
the
episode
of
the
nice
little
village
girl
with
whom
tenham
and
himself
had
been
getting
along
so
enormously
well
when
the
raging
young
ass
had
found
them
out
and
made
an
absurdly
exaggerated
scene
even
going
so
far
as
threatening
to
smash
the
pair
of
them
marching
off
to
the
father
and
mother
and
setting
the
vicar
on
and
then
scratching
together
god
knows
how
money
enough
to
pack
the
lot
off
to
america
where
they
had
since
done
well
why
should
a
man
forgive
another
who
had
made
him
look
like
a
schoolboy
and
a
fool
so
to
find
mount
dunstan
rushing
down
a
steep
hill
into
this
thing
was
edifying
you
can
not
take
much
out
of
a
man
if
you
never
encounter
him
if
you
meet
him
you
are
provided
by
heaven
with
opportunities
you
can
find
out
what
he
feels
most
sharply
and
what
he
will
suffer
most
by
being
deprived
of
his
impression
was
that
there
was
a
good
deal
to
be
got
out
of
mount
dunstan
he
was
an
obstinate
haughty
devil
and
just
the
fellow
to
conceal
with
a
fury
of
pride
a
score
of
tender
places
in
his
hide
at
the
ball
he
had
seen
that
the
girl
effect
had
been
of
a
kind
which
even
money
and
good
looks
uncombined
with
another
thing
might
not
have
produced
and
she
had
the
other
thing
whatsoever
it
might
be
he
observed
the
way
in
which
the
dunholms
met
and
greeted
her
he
marked
the
glance
of
the
royal
personage
and
his
manner
when
after
her
presentation
he
conversed
with
and
detained
her
he
saw
the
turning
of
heads
and
exchange
of
remarks
as
she
moved
through
the
rooms
most
especially
he
took
in
the
bearing
of
the
very
grand
old
ladies
led
by
lady
alanby
of
dole
barriers
had
thrown
themselves
down
these
portentous
rigorous
old
pussycats
admired
her
even
liked
her
upon
my
word
he
said
to
himself
she
has
a
way
with
her
you
know
she
is
a
combination
of
ethel
newcome
and
becky
sharp
but
she
is
more
than
either
of
them
there
a
touch
of
trix
esmond
the
sense
of
the
success
which
followed
her
and
the
excitement
of
looking
on
at
her
light
whirls
of
dance
the
carnation
of
her
cheek
and
the
laughter
and
pleasure
she
drew
about
her
had
affected
him
in
a
way
by
which
he
was
secretly
a
little
exhilarated
he
was
conscious
of
a
rash
desire
to
force
his
way
through
these
laughing
vaunting
young
idiots
juggle
or
snatch
their
dances
away
from
them
and
seize
on
the
girl
himself
he
had
not
for
so
long
a
time
been
impelled
by
such
agreeable
folly
that
he
had
sometimes
felt
the
stab
of
the
thought
that
he
was
past
it
that
it
should
rise
in
him
again
made
him
feel
young
there
was
nothing
which
so
irritated
him
against
mount
dunstan
as
his
own
rebelling
recognition
of
the
man
youth
the
strength
of
his
fine
body
his
head
and
clear
eye
these
things
and
others
it
was
which
swayed
him
as
was
plain
to
betty
in
the
time
which
followed
to
many
changes
of
mood
are
you
sorry
for
a
man
who
is
ill
and
depressed
he
asked
one
day
or
do
you
despise
him
i
am
then
be
sorry
for
he
had
come
out
of
the
house
to
her
as
she
sat
on
the
lawn
under
a
broad
tree
and
had
thrown
himself
upon
a
rug
with
his
hands
clasped
behind
his
head
are
you
ill
when
i
was
on
the
riviera
i
had
a
he
lied
simply
i
strained
some
muscle
or
other
and
it
has
left
me
rather
lame
sometimes
i
have
a
good
deal
of
i
am
very
sorry
said
betty
a
woman
who
can
be
made
sorry
it
is
rarely
impossible
to
manage
to
dwell
with
pathetic
patience
on
your
grievances
if
she
is
weak
and
unintelligent
to
deplore
with
honest
regret
your
faults
and
blunders
if
she
is
strong
are
not
bad
ideas
he
looked
at
her
reflectively
yes
you
are
capable
of
being
sorry
he
decided
for
a
few
moments
of
silence
his
eyes
rested
upon
the
view
spread
before
him
to
give
the
expression
of
dignified
reflection
was
not
a
bad
idea
either
do
you
know
he
said
at
length
that
you
produce
an
extraordinary
effect
upon
me
betty
she
was
occupying
herself
by
adding
a
few
stitches
to
one
of
ancient
strips
of
embroidery
and
as
she
answered
she
laid
it
flat
upon
her
knee
to
consider
its
effect
good
or
bad
she
inquired
with
delicate
abstraction
he
turned
his
face
towards
her
again
this
time
quickly
both
he
answered
his
tone
held
the
flash
of
a
heat
which
he
felt
should
have
startled
her
slightly
but
apparently
it
did
not
i
do
not
like
with
composed
lightness
if
you
had
said
that
you
felt
yourself
develop
angelic
qualities
when
you
were
near
me
i
should
feel
flattered
and
swell
with
pride
but
leaves
me
unsatisfied
it
interferes
with
the
happy
little
conceit
that
one
is
an
beneficent
power
one
likes
to
contemplate
a
large
picture
of
one
self
not
plain
but
coloured
as
a
wholesale
i
see
thank
you
stiffly
and
flushing
you
do
not
believe
her
effect
upon
him
was
such
that
for
the
moment
he
found
himself
choosing
to
believe
that
he
was
in
earnest
his
desire
to
impress
her
with
his
mood
had
actually
led
to
this
result
she
ought
to
have
been
rather
moved
a
little
fluttered
perhaps
at
hearing
that
she
disturbed
his
equilibrium
you
set
yourself
against
me
as
a
child
betty
he
said
and
you
set
yourself
against
me
now
you
will
not
give
me
fair
play
you
might
give
me
fair
he
dropped
his
voice
at
the
last
sentence
and
knew
it
was
well
done
a
touch
of
hopelessness
is
not
often
lost
on
a
woman
what
would
you
consider
fair
play
she
inquired
it
would
be
fair
to
listen
to
me
without
prejudice
to
let
me
explain
how
it
has
happened
that
i
have
appeared
to
you
a
a
blackguard
i
have
no
doubt
you
would
call
it
and
a
he
threw
out
his
hand
in
an
impatient
gesture
impatient
of
himself
his
fate
the
tricks
of
bad
fortune
which
it
implied
had
made
of
him
a
more
erring
mortal
than
he
would
have
been
if
left
to
himself
and
treated
decently
do
not
put
it
so
strongly
with
conservative
politeness
i
do
refuse
to
admit
that
i
am
handicapped
by
a
devil
of
a
temperament
that
is
an
inherited
ah
said
betty
one
of
the
temperaments
one
reads
about
for
which
no
one
is
to
be
blamed
but
one
deceased
relatives
after
all
that
is
comparatively
easy
to
deal
with
one
can
just
go
on
doing
what
one
wants
to
do
and
then
condemn
one
grandparents
a
repellent
quality
in
her
which
had
also
the
trick
of
transforming
itself
into
an
exasperating
attraction
was
that
she
deprived
him
of
the
luxury
he
had
been
most
tenacious
of
throughout
his
existence
if
the
injustice
of
fate
has
failed
to
bestow
upon
a
man
fortune
good
looks
or
brilliance
his
exercise
of
the
power
to
disturb
to
enrage
those
who
dare
not
resent
to
wound
and
take
the
nonsense
out
of
those
about
him
will
at
all
events
preclude
the
possibility
of
his
being
passed
over
as
a
factor
not
to
be
considered
if
to
charm
and
bestow
gives
the
sense
of
power
to
thwart
and
humiliate
may
be
found
not
wholly
unsatisfying
but
in
her
case
the
inadequacy
of
the
usual
methods
had
forced
itself
upon
him
it
was
as
if
the
dart
being
aimed
at
her
she
caught
it
in
her
hand
in
its
flight
broke
off
its
point
and
threw
it
lightly
aside
without
comment
most
women
can
not
resist
the
temptation
to
answer
a
speech
containing
a
sting
or
a
reproach
it
was
part
of
her
abnormality
that
she
could
let
such
things
go
by
in
a
detached
silence
which
did
not
express
even
the
germ
of
comment
or
opinion
upon
them
this
he
said
was
the
result
of
her
beastly
sense
of
security
which
in
its
turn
was
the
result
of
the
atmosphere
of
wealth
she
had
breathed
since
her
birth
there
had
been
no
obstacle
which
could
not
be
removed
for
her
no
law
of
limitation
had
laid
its
rein
on
her
neck
she
had
not
been
taught
by
her
existence
the
importance
of
propitiating
opinion
under
such
conditions
how
was
fear
to
be
learned
she
had
not
learned
it
but
for
the
devil
in
the
blue
between
her
lashes
he
realised
that
he
should
have
broken
loose
long
ago
i
suppose
i
deserved
that
for
making
a
stupid
appeal
to
sympathy
he
remarked
i
will
not
do
it
if
she
had
been
the
woman
who
can
be
gently
goaded
into
reply
she
would
have
made
answer
to
this
but
she
allowed
the
observation
to
pass
giving
it
free
flight
into
space
where
it
lost
itself
after
the
annoying
manner
of
its
kind
have
you
any
objection
to
telling
me
why
you
decided
to
come
to
england
this
year
he
inquired
with
a
casual
air
after
the
pause
which
she
did
not
fill
in
the
bluntness
of
the
question
did
not
seem
to
disturb
her
she
was
not
sorry
in
fact
that
he
had
asked
it
she
let
her
work
lie
upon
her
knee
and
leaned
back
in
her
low
garden
chair
her
hands
resting
upon
its
wicker
arms
she
turned
on
him
a
clear
unprejudiced
gaze
i
came
to
see
rosy
i
have
always
been
very
fond
of
her
i
did
not
believe
that
she
had
forgotten
how
much
we
had
loved
her
or
how
much
she
had
loved
us
i
knew
that
if
i
could
see
her
again
i
should
understand
why
she
had
seemed
to
forget
and
when
you
saw
her
you
of
course
decided
that
i
had
behaved
to
quote
my
own
words
like
a
blackguard
and
a
it
is
of
course
very
rude
to
say
you
have
behaved
like
a
fool
but
if
you
excuse
my
saying
so
that
is
what
has
impressed
me
very
much
do
you
know
with
a
moderation
which
singularly
drove
itself
home
that
if
you
had
been
kind
to
her
and
had
made
her
happy
you
could
have
had
anything
you
wished
for
without
trouble
this
was
one
of
the
unadorned
facts
which
are
like
bullets
disgustedly
he
found
himself
veering
towards
an
outlook
which
forced
him
to
admit
that
there
was
probably
truth
in
what
she
said
and
he
knew
he
heard
more
truth
as
she
went
on
she
would
have
wanted
only
what
you
wanted
and
she
would
not
have
asked
much
in
return
she
would
not
have
asked
as
much
as
i
should
what
you
did
was
not
she
paused
a
moment
to
give
thought
to
it
you
paid
too
high
a
price
for
the
luxury
of
indulging
the
inherited
temperament
your
luxury
was
not
to
control
it
but
it
was
a
bad
the
figure
of
speech
is
rather
commercial
coldly
it
is
curious
that
most
things
are
as
a
rule
there
is
always
the
parallel
of
profit
and
loss
whether
one
sees
it
or
not
the
profits
are
happiness
and
friendship
enjoyment
of
life
and
approbation
if
the
inherited
temperament
supplies
one
with
all
one
wants
of
such
things
it
can
not
be
called
a
loss
of
you
think
however
that
mine
has
not
brought
me
much
i
do
not
know
it
is
you
who
well
viciously
there
has
been
a
sort
of
luxury
in
it
in
lashing
out
with
one
heels
and
smashing
things
and
in
knowing
that
people
prefer
to
keep
she
lifted
her
shoulders
a
little
then
perhaps
it
has
no
suddenly
and
fiercely
damn
it
it
has
not
and
she
actually
made
no
reply
to
that
what
do
you
mean
to
do
he
questioned
as
bluntly
as
before
he
knew
she
would
understand
what
he
meant
not
much
to
see
that
rosy
is
not
unhappy
any
more
we
can
prevent
that
she
was
out
of
repair
as
the
house
was
she
is
being
rebuilt
and
decorated
she
knows
that
she
will
be
taken
care
i
know
her
better
than
you
do
with
a
laugh
she
will
not
go
away
she
is
too
frightened
of
the
row
it
would
make
of
what
i
should
say
i
should
have
plenty
to
say
i
can
make
her
shake
in
her
betty
let
her
eyes
rest
full
upon
him
and
he
saw
that
she
was
softly
summing
him
up
quite
without
prejudice
merely
in
interested
speculation
upon
the
workings
of
type
you
are
letting
the
inherited
temperament
run
away
with
you
at
this
moment
she
reflected
aloud
her
quiet
scrutiny
almost
abstracted
it
was
foolish
to
say
he
had
known
it
was
foolish
two
seconds
after
the
words
had
left
his
lips
but
a
temper
which
has
been
allowed
to
leap
hedges
unchecked
throughout
life
is
in
peril
of
forming
a
habit
of
taking
them
even
at
such
times
as
a
leap
may
land
its
owner
in
a
ditch
this
last
was
what
her
interested
eyes
were
obviously
saying
it
suited
him
best
at
the
moment
to
try
to
laugh
do
look
at
me
like
that
he
threw
off
as
if
you
were
calculating
that
two
and
two
make
no
prejudice
of
mine
can
induce
them
to
make
five
or
six
or
three
and
a
half
she
said
no
prejudice
of
mine
or
of
the
two
and
two
she
was
calculating
with
were
the
likelihoods
and
unlikelihoods
of
the
inherited
temperament
and
the
practical
powers
she
could
absolutely
count
on
if
difficulty
arose
with
regard
to
rosy
he
guessed
at
this
and
began
to
make
calculations
himself
but
there
was
no
further
conversation
for
them
as
they
were
obliged
to
rise
to
their
feet
to
receive
visitors
lady
alanby
of
dole
and
sir
thomas
her
grandson
were
being
brought
out
of
the
house
to
them
by
rosalie
he
went
forward
to
meet
them
his
manner
that
of
the
graceful
host
lady
alanby
having
been
welcomed
by
him
and
led
to
the
most
comfortable
chair
found
his
bearing
so
elegantly
chastened
that
she
gazed
at
him
with
private
curiosity
to
her
and
highly
experienced
old
mind
it
seemed
the
bearing
of
a
man
who
was
up
to
what
special
thing
did
he
chance
to
be
up
to
his
glance
certainly
lurked
after
miss
vanderpoel
oddly
was
he
falling
in
unholy
love
with
the
girl
under
his
stupid
little
wife
very
nose
she
could
not
however
give
her
undivided
attention
to
him
as
she
wished
to
keep
her
eye
on
her
grandson
and
outrageously
enough
it
happened
that
just
as
tea
was
brought
out
and
tommy
was
beginning
to
cheer
up
and
quite
come
out
a
little
under
the
spur
of
the
activities
of
handing
bread
and
butter
and
cress
sandwiches
who
should
appear
but
the
two
lithcom
girls
escorted
by
their
aunt
mrs
manners
with
whom
they
lived
as
they
were
orphans
without
money
if
the
manners
who
were
rather
well
off
had
not
taken
them
in
they
would
have
had
to
go
to
the
workhouse
or
into
genteel
amateur
shops
as
they
were
not
clever
enough
for
governesses
mary
with
her
nose
looked
just
about
as
usual
but
jane
had
a
new
frock
on
which
was
exactly
the
colour
of
the
big
appealing
eyes
with
their
trick
of
following
people
about
she
looked
a
little
pale
and
pathetic
which
somehow
gave
her
a
specious
air
of
being
pretty
which
she
really
was
not
at
all
the
swaying
young
thinness
of
those
very
slight
girls
whose
soft
summer
muslins
make
them
look
like
delicate
bags
tied
in
the
middle
with
fluttering
ribbons
has
almost
invariably
a
foolish
attraction
for
burly
young
men
whose
characters
are
chiefly
marked
by
lack
of
forethought
and
lady
alanby
saw
tommy
robust
young
body
give
a
sort
of
jerk
as
the
party
of
three
was
brought
across
the
grass
after
it
he
pulled
himself
together
hastily
and
looked
stiff
and
pink
shaking
hands
as
if
his
elbow
joint
was
out
of
order
being
at
once
too
loose
and
too
rigid
he
began
to
be
clumsy
with
the
bread
and
butter
and
ceasing
his
talk
with
miss
vanderpoel
fell
into
silence
why
should
he
go
on
talking
he
thought
miss
vanderpoel
was
a
cracking
handsome
girl
but
she
was
too
clever
for
him
and
he
had
to
think
of
all
sorts
of
new
things
to
say
when
he
talked
to
her
and
well
a
fellow
could
never
imagine
himself
stretched
out
on
the
grass
puffing
happily
away
at
a
pipe
with
a
girl
like
that
sitting
near
him
smiling
the
hot
turf
smelling
almost
like
hay
the
hot
blue
sky
curving
overhead
and
both
the
girl
and
himself
perfectly
happy
chock
full
of
joy
though
neither
of
them
were
saying
anything
at
all
you
could
imagine
it
with
some
girls
you
did
imagine
it
when
you
wakened
early
on
a
summer
morning
and
lay
in
luxurious
stillness
listening
to
the
birds
singing
like
mad
lady
jane
was
a
girl
and
she
tried
to
keep
her
following
blue
eyes
fixed
on
the
grass
or
on
lady
anstruthers
or
miss
vanderpoel
but
there
was
something
like
a
string
which
sometimes
pulled
them
in
another
direction
and
once
when
this
had
happened
quite
against
her
will
she
was
terrified
to
find
lady
alanby
glass
lifted
and
fixed
upon
her
as
lady
alanby
opinion
of
mrs
manners
was
but
a
poor
one
and
as
mrs
manners
was
stricken
dumb
by
her
combined
dislike
and
awe
of
lady
alanby
a
slight
stiffness
might
have
settled
upon
the
gathering
if
betty
had
not
made
an
effort
she
applied
herself
to
lady
alanby
and
mrs
manners
at
once
and
ended
by
making
them
talk
to
each
other
when
they
left
the
tea
table
under
the
trees
to
look
at
the
gardens
she
walked
between
them
playing
upon
the
primeval
horticultural
passions
which
dominate
the
existence
of
all
respectable
and
normal
country
ladies
until
the
gulf
between
them
was
temporarily
bridged
this
being
achieved
she
adroitly
passed
them
over
to
lady
anstruthers
who
nigel
observed
with
some
curiosity
accepted
the
casual
responsibility
without
manifest
discomfiture
to
the
aching
tommy
the
manner
in
which
a
few
minutes
later
he
found
himself
standing
alone
with
jane
lithcom
in
a
path
of
clipped
laurels
was
almost
bewilderingly
simple
at
the
end
of
the
laurel
walk
was
a
pretty
peep
of
the
country
and
miss
vanderpoel
had
brought
him
to
see
it
nigel
anstruthers
had
been
loitering
behind
with
jane
and
mary
as
miss
vanderpoel
turned
with
him
into
the
path
she
stooped
and
picked
a
blossom
from
a
clump
of
speedwell
growing
at
the
foot
of
a
bit
of
wall
lady
jane
eyes
are
just
the
colour
of
this
flower
she
said
yes
they
are
he
answered
glancing
down
at
the
lovely
little
blue
thing
as
she
held
it
in
her
hand
and
then
with
a
thump
of
the
heart
most
people
do
not
think
she
is
pretty
but
i
quite
desperately
i
his
mood
had
become
rash
so
do
i
betty
vanderpoel
answered
then
the
others
joined
them
and
miss
vanderpoel
paused
to
talk
a
little
and
when
they
went
on
she
was
with
mary
and
nigel
anstruthers
and
he
was
with
jane
walking
slowly
and
somehow
the
others
melted
away
turning
in
a
perfectly
natural
manner
into
a
side
path
their
own
slow
pace
became
slower
in
fact
in
a
few
moments
they
were
standing
quite
still
between
the
green
walls
jane
turned
a
little
aside
and
picked
off
some
small
leaves
nervously
he
saw
the
muslin
on
her
chest
lift
quiveringly
oh
little
jane
he
said
in
a
big
shaky
whisper
the
following
eyes
incontinently
brimmed
over
some
shining
drops
fell
on
the
softness
of
the
blue
muslin
oh
tommy
giving
up
it
no
use
talking
at
you
must
think
you
must
think
anything
he
falteringly
commanded
drawing
nearer
because
it
was
impossible
not
to
do
it
what
he
really
meant
though
he
did
not
know
how
decorously
to
say
it
was
that
she
must
not
think
that
he
could
be
moved
by
any
tall
beauty
towards
the
splendour
of
whose
possessions
his
revered
grandmother
might
be
driving
him
i
am
not
thinking
anything
cried
jane
in
answer
but
she
is
everything
and
i
am
nothing
just
look
at
her
and
then
look
at
me
i
look
at
you
as
long
as
you
let
me
gulped
tommy
and
he
was
boy
enough
and
man
enough
to
put
a
hand
on
each
of
her
shoulders
and
drown
his
longing
in
her
brimming
eyes
mary
and
miss
vanderpoel
were
talking
with
a
curious
intimacy
in
another
part
of
the
garden
where
they
were
together
alone
sir
nigel
having
been
reattached
to
lady
alanby
you
have
known
sir
thomas
a
long
time
betty
had
just
said
since
we
were
children
jane
reminded
me
at
the
dunholms
ball
that
she
had
played
cricket
with
him
when
she
was
they
have
always
liked
each
other
miss
vanderpoel
suggested
mary
looked
up
at
her
and
the
meeting
of
their
eyes
was
frank
to
revelation
but
for
the
clear
girlish
liking
for
herself
she
saw
in
betty
vanderpoel
mary
would
have
known
her
next
speech
to
be
of
imbecile
bluntness
she
had
heard
that
americans
often
had
a
queer
delightful
understanding
of
unconventional
things
this
splendid
girl
was
understanding
her
oh
you
see
she
broke
out
you
left
them
together
on
purpose
yes
i
and
there
was
a
comprehension
so
deep
in
her
look
that
mary
knew
it
was
deeper
than
her
own
and
somehow
founded
on
some
subtler
feeling
than
her
own
when
two
people
want
so
much
care
so
much
to
be
together
miss
vanderpoel
added
quite
slowly
even
as
if
the
words
rather
forced
themselves
from
her
it
seems
as
if
the
whole
world
ought
to
help
them
everything
in
the
world
the
very
wind
and
rain
and
sun
and
stars
oh
things
have
no
right
to
keep
them
mary
stared
at
her
moved
and
fascinated
she
scarcely
knew
that
she
caught
at
her
hand
i
have
never
been
in
the
state
that
jane
is
she
poured
forth
and
i
ca
understand
how
she
can
be
such
a
fool
but
but
we
care
about
each
other
more
than
most
girls
do
perhaps
because
we
have
had
no
people
and
it
the
kind
of
thing
there
is
no
use
talking
against
it
seems
it
killing
the
youngness
in
her
if
it
ends
miserably
it
will
be
as
if
she
had
had
an
illness
and
got
up
from
it
a
faded
spinster
with
a
stretch
of
hideous
years
to
live
her
blue
eyes
will
look
like
boiled
gooseberries
because
she
will
have
cried
all
the
colour
out
of
them
oh
you
understand
i
see
you
before
she
had
finished
both
miss
vanderpoel
hands
were
holding
hers
i
do
i
do
she
said
and
she
did
as
a
year
ago
she
had
not
known
she
could
is
it
lady
alanby
she
ventured
yes
tommy
will
be
helplessly
poor
if
she
does
not
leave
him
her
money
and
she
wo
if
he
makes
her
angry
she
is
very
determined
she
will
leave
it
to
an
awful
cousin
if
she
gets
in
a
rage
and
tommy
is
not
clever
he
could
never
earn
his
living
neither
could
jane
they
could
never
marry
you
ca
defy
relatives
and
marry
on
nothing
unless
you
are
a
character
in
a
has
she
liked
lady
jane
in
the
past
miss
vanderpoel
asked
as
if
she
was
mentally
rapidly
going
over
the
ground
that
she
might
quite
comprehend
everything
yes
she
used
to
make
rather
a
pet
of
her
she
did
like
me
she
was
taken
by
jane
meek
attentive
obedient
ways
jane
was
born
a
sweet
little
affectionate
worm
lady
alanby
ca
hate
her
even
now
she
just
pushes
her
out
of
her
because
said
betty
vanderpoel
mary
prefaced
her
answer
with
a
brief
laugh
because
of
because
she
thinks
i
do
see
how
she
can
believe
he
has
much
of
a
chance
i
do
think
she
does
but
she
will
never
forgive
him
if
he
does
make
a
try
at
finding
out
whether
he
has
one
or
it
is
very
businesslike
betty
made
observation
mary
laughed
we
talk
of
american
business
outlook
she
said
but
very
few
of
us
english
people
are
dreamy
idealists
we
are
of
a
coolness
and
a
daring
when
we
are
dealing
with
questions
of
this
sort
i
do
think
you
can
know
the
thing
you
have
brought
here
you
descend
on
a
dull
country
place
with
your
money
and
your
looks
and
you
simply
stay
and
amuse
yourself
by
doing
extraordinary
things
as
if
there
was
no
london
waiting
for
you
everyone
knows
this
wo
last
next
season
you
will
be
presented
and
have
a
huge
success
you
will
be
whirled
about
in
a
vortex
and
people
will
sit
on
the
edge
and
cast
big
strong
lines
baited
with
the
most
glittering
things
they
can
get
together
you
be
able
to
get
away
lady
alanby
knows
there
would
be
no
chance
for
tommy
then
it
would
be
too
idiotic
to
expect
it
he
must
make
his
try
their
eyes
met
again
and
miss
vanderpoel
looked
neither
shocked
nor
angry
but
an
odd
small
shadow
swept
across
her
face
mary
of
course
did
not
know
that
she
was
thinking
of
the
thing
she
had
realised
so
often
that
it
was
not
easy
to
detach
one
self
from
the
fact
that
one
was
reuben
vanderpoel
daughter
as
a
result
of
it
here
one
was
indecently
and
unwillingly
disturbing
the
lives
of
innocent
unassuming
lovers
and
so
long
as
sir
thomas
has
not
tried
and
found
out
lady
jane
will
be
made
unhappy
if
he
were
to
let
you
escape
without
trying
he
would
not
be
forgiven
his
grandmother
has
had
her
own
way
all
her
but
suppose
after
i
went
away
someone
else
came
mary
shook
her
head
people
like
you
do
happen
in
one
neighbourhood
twice
in
a
lifetime
i
am
and
you
are
the
first
i
have
and
he
will
only
be
safe
if
mary
lithcom
nodded
yes
if
she
answered
it
silly
and
frightful
but
it
is
miss
vanderpoel
looked
down
on
the
grass
a
few
moments
and
then
seemed
to
arrive
at
a
decision
he
likes
you
you
can
make
him
understand
things
she
inquired
then
go
and
tell
him
that
if
he
will
come
here
and
ask
me
a
direct
question
i
will
give
him
a
direct
answer
which
will
satisfy
lady
lady
mary
caught
her
breath
do
you
know
you
are
the
most
wonderful
girl
i
ever
saw
she
exclaimed
but
if
you
only
knew
what
i
feel
about
janie
and
tears
rushed
into
her
eyes
i
feel
just
the
same
thing
about
my
sister
said
miss
vanderpoel
i
think
rosy
and
lady
jane
are
rather
when
tommy
tramped
across
the
grass
towards
her
he
was
turning
red
and
white
by
turns
and
looking
somewhat
like
a
young
man
who
was
being
marched
up
to
a
cannon
mouth
it
struck
him
that
it
was
an
american
kind
of
thing
he
was
called
upon
to
do
and
he
was
not
an
american
but
british
from
the
top
of
his
head
to
the
rather
thick
soles
of
his
boots
he
was
in
truth
overwhelmed
by
his
sense
of
his
inadequacy
to
the
demands
of
the
brilliantly
conceived
but
situation
joy
and
terror
swept
over
his
being
in
waves
the
tall
proud
look
of
her
as
she
stood
under
a
tree
waiting
for
him
would
have
struck
his
courage
dead
on
the
spot
and
caused
him
to
turn
and
flee
in
anguish
if
she
had
not
made
a
little
move
towards
him
with
a
heavenly
humanness
in
her
eyes
the
way
she
managed
it
was
an
amazing
thing
he
could
never
have
managed
it
at
all
himself
she
came
forward
and
gave
him
her
hand
and
really
it
was
her
hand
which
held
his
own
comparatively
steady
it
is
for
lady
jane
she
said
that
prevents
it
from
being
ridiculous
or
improper
it
is
for
lady
jane
her
eyes
with
a
laugh
are
the
colour
of
the
blue
speedwell
i
showed
you
it
is
the
colour
of
babies
eyes
and
hers
look
as
theirs
do
as
if
they
asked
everybody
not
to
hurt
he
actually
fell
upon
his
knee
and
bending
his
head
over
her
hand
kissed
it
half
a
dozen
times
with
adoration
good
lord
how
she
saw
and
knew
if
jane
were
not
jane
and
you
were
not
you
the
words
rushed
from
him
it
would
be
the
most
outrageous
the
most
impudent
thing
a
man
ever
had
the
cheek
to
but
it
is
she
did
not
draw
her
hand
away
and
oh
the
girlish
kindness
of
her
smiling
supporting
look
you
came
to
ask
me
if
if
you
would
marry
me
miss
vanderpoel
his
head
bending
over
her
hand
again
i
beg
your
pardon
i
beg
your
pardon
oh
lord
i
do
i
thank
you
for
the
compliment
you
pay
me
she
answered
i
like
you
very
much
sir
thomas
and
i
like
you
just
now
more
than
ever
but
i
could
not
marry
you
i
should
not
make
you
happy
and
i
should
not
be
happy
myself
the
truth
is
thinking
a
moment
each
of
us
really
belongs
to
a
different
kind
of
person
and
each
of
knows
the
god
bless
you
he
said
i
think
you
know
everything
in
the
world
a
woman
can
know
and
remain
an
it
was
an
outburst
of
eloquence
and
she
took
it
in
the
prettiest
way
with
the
prettiest
laugh
which
had
in
it
no
touch
of
mockery
or
disbelief
in
him
what
i
have
said
is
quite
final
if
lady
alanby
should
inquire
she
said
adding
rather
quickly
someone
is
it
pleased
her
to
see
that
he
did
not
hurry
to
his
feet
clumsily
but
even
stood
upright
with
a
shade
of
boyish
dignity
and
did
not
release
her
hand
before
he
had
bent
his
head
low
over
it
again
sir
nigel
was
bringing
with
him
lady
alanby
mrs
manners
and
his
wife
and
when
betty
met
his
eyes
she
knew
at
once
that
he
had
not
made
his
way
to
this
particular
garden
without
intention
he
had
discovered
that
she
was
with
tommy
and
it
had
entertained
him
to
break
in
upon
them
i
did
not
intend
to
interrupt
sir
thomas
at
his
devotions
he
remarked
to
her
after
dinner
accept
my
it
did
not
matter
in
the
least
thank
you
said
betty
i
am
glad
to
be
able
to
say
thomas
that
you
did
not
look
an
entire
fool
when
you
got
up
from
your
knees
as
we
came
into
the
rose
thus
lady
alanby
as
their
carriage
turned
out
of
stornham
village
i
glad
myself
tommy
answered
what
were
you
doing
there
even
if
you
were
asking
her
to
marry
you
it
was
not
necessary
to
go
that
far
we
are
not
in
the
seventeenth
then
tommy
flushed
i
did
not
intend
to
do
it
i
could
not
help
it
she
was
so
so
nice
about
everything
that
girl
is
an
angel
i
told
her
very
right
and
proper
spirit
to
approach
her
in
answered
the
old
woman
watching
him
keenly
was
she
angel
enough
to
say
she
would
marry
you
tommy
for
some
occult
reason
had
the
courage
to
stare
back
into
his
grandmother
eyes
quite
as
if
he
were
a
man
and
not
a
hobbledehoy
expecting
to
be
bullied
she
does
not
want
me
he
answered
and
i
knew
she
would
why
should
she
i
did
what
you
ordered
me
to
do
and
she
answered
me
as
i
knew
she
would
she
might
have
snubbed
me
but
she
has
such
a
way
with
her
such
a
way
of
saying
things
and
understanding
that
that
well
i
found
myself
on
one
knee
kissing
her
hand
as
if
i
was
being
presented
at
old
lady
alanby
looked
out
on
the
passing
landscape
well
you
did
your
best
she
summed
the
matter
up
at
last
if
you
went
down
on
your
knees
involuntarily
if
you
had
done
it
on
purpose
it
would
have
been
chapter
xxxiv
red
godwyn
stornham
court
had
taken
its
proper
position
in
the
county
as
a
place
which
was
equal
to
social
exchange
in
the
matter
of
entertainment
sir
nigel
and
lady
anstruthers
had
given
a
garden
party
according
to
the
decrees
of
the
law
obtaining
in
country
neighbourhoods
the
curiosity
to
behold
miss
vanderpoel
and
the
change
which
had
been
worked
in
the
desolation
and
disrepair
precluded
the
possibility
of
the
refusal
of
any
invitations
sent
the
recipient
being
in
his
or
her
right
mind
and
sound
in
wind
and
limb
that
astonishing
things
had
been
accomplished
and
that
the
party
was
a
successful
affair
could
not
but
be
accepted
as
truths
garden
parties
had
been
heard
of
were
a
trifle
repetitional
and
even
dull
but
at
this
one
there
was
real
music
and
real
dancing
and
clever
entertainments
were
given
at
intervals
in
a
little
theatre
erected
for
the
occasion
these
were
agreeable
additions
to
mere
food
and
conversation
which
were
capable
of
palling
to
the
garden
party
the
anstruthers
did
not
confine
themselves
there
were
dinner
parties
at
stornham
and
they
also
were
successful
functions
the
guests
were
of
those
who
make
for
the
success
of
such
entertainments
i
called
upon
mount
dunstan
this
afternoon
sir
nigel
said
one
evening
before
the
first
of
these
dinners
he
might
expect
it
as
one
is
asking
him
to
dine
i
wish
him
to
be
asked
the
dunholms
have
taken
him
up
so
tremendously
that
no
festivity
seems
complete
without
he
had
been
invited
to
the
garden
party
and
had
appeared
but
betty
had
seen
little
of
him
it
is
easy
to
see
little
of
a
guest
at
an
festivity
in
assisting
rosalie
to
attend
to
her
visitors
she
had
been
much
occupied
but
she
had
known
that
she
might
have
seen
more
of
him
if
he
had
intended
that
it
should
be
so
he
did
not
for
reasons
of
his
own
intend
that
it
should
be
so
and
this
she
became
aware
of
so
she
walked
played
in
the
bowling
green
danced
and
talked
with
westholt
tommy
alanby
and
others
he
does
not
want
to
talk
to
me
he
will
not
if
he
can
avoid
it
was
what
she
said
to
herself
she
saw
that
he
rather
sought
out
mary
lithcom
who
was
not
accustomed
to
receiving
special
attention
the
two
walked
together
danced
together
and
in
adjoining
chairs
watched
the
performance
in
the
embowered
theatre
lady
mary
enjoyed
her
companion
very
much
but
she
wondered
why
he
had
attached
himself
to
her
betty
vanderpoel
asked
herself
what
they
talked
to
each
other
about
and
did
not
suspect
the
truth
which
was
that
they
talked
a
good
deal
of
herself
have
you
seen
much
of
miss
vanderpoel
lady
mary
had
begun
by
asking
i
have
seen
her
a
good
deal
as
no
doubt
you
lady
mary
plain
face
expressed
a
somewhat
touched
reflectiveness
do
you
know
she
said
that
the
garden
parties
have
been
a
different
thing
this
whole
summer
just
because
one
always
knew
one
would
see
her
at
them
a
short
laugh
from
mount
dunstan
jane
and
i
have
gone
to
every
garden
party
within
twenty
miles
ever
since
we
left
the
schoolroom
and
we
are
very
tired
of
them
but
this
year
we
have
quite
cheered
up
when
we
are
dressing
to
go
to
something
dull
we
say
to
each
other
at
any
rate
miss
vanderpoel
will
be
there
and
we
shall
see
what
she
has
on
and
how
her
things
are
made
and
that
something
besides
the
fun
of
watching
people
make
up
to
her
and
hearing
them
talk
about
the
men
who
want
to
marry
her
and
wonder
which
one
she
will
take
she
will
not
take
anyone
in
this
place
the
nice
nose
slightly
suggesting
a
derisive
sniff
who
is
there
who
is
suitable
mount
dunstan
laughed
shortly
again
how
do
you
know
i
am
not
an
aspirant
myself
he
said
he
had
a
mirthless
sense
of
enjoyment
in
his
own
brazenness
only
he
himself
knew
how
brazen
the
speech
was
lady
mary
looked
at
him
with
entire
composure
i
am
quite
sure
you
are
not
an
aspirant
for
anybody
and
i
happen
to
know
that
you
dislike
moneyed
international
marriages
you
are
so
obviously
british
that
even
if
i
had
not
been
told
that
i
should
know
it
was
true
miss
vanderpoel
herself
knows
it
is
does
she
lady
alanby
spoke
of
it
to
sir
nigel
and
i
heard
sir
nigel
tell
exactly
the
kind
of
unnecessary
thing
he
would
be
likely
to
he
cast
the
subject
aside
as
if
it
were
a
worthless
superfluity
and
went
on
when
you
say
there
is
no
one
suitable
you
surely
forget
lord
yes
it
true
i
forgot
him
for
the
moment
but
with
a
laugh
one
rather
feels
as
if
she
would
require
a
royal
duke
or
something
of
that
you
think
she
expects
that
kind
of
thing
rather
indifferently
she
she
does
think
of
the
subject
she
simply
thinks
of
other
things
of
lady
anstruthers
and
ughtred
of
the
work
at
stornham
and
the
village
life
which
gives
her
new
emotions
and
interest
she
also
thinks
about
being
nice
to
people
she
is
nicer
than
any
girl
i
you
feel
however
she
has
a
right
to
expect
it
still
without
more
than
a
casual
air
of
interest
well
what
do
you
feel
yourself
said
lady
mary
women
who
look
like
that
even
when
they
are
not
millionairesses
usually
marry
whom
they
choose
i
do
not
believe
that
the
two
beautiful
miss
gunnings
rolled
into
one
would
have
made
anything
as
undeniable
as
she
is
one
has
seen
portraits
of
them
look
at
her
as
she
stands
there
talking
to
tommy
and
lord
dunholm
internally
mount
dunstan
was
saying
i
am
looking
at
her
thank
you
and
setting
his
teeth
a
little
but
lady
mary
was
launched
upon
a
subject
which
swept
her
along
with
it
and
she
so
to
speak
ground
the
thing
in
look
at
the
turn
of
her
head
look
at
her
mouth
and
chin
and
her
eyes
with
the
lashes
sweeping
over
them
when
she
looks
down
you
must
have
noticed
the
effect
when
she
lifts
them
suddenly
to
look
at
you
it
so
odd
and
lovely
that
it
it
almost
almost
makes
you
jump
ended
mount
dunstan
drily
she
did
not
laugh
and
in
fact
her
expression
became
rather
sympathetically
serious
ah
she
said
i
believe
you
feel
a
sort
of
rebellion
against
the
unfairness
of
the
way
things
are
dealt
out
it
does
seem
unfair
of
course
it
would
be
perfectly
disgraceful
if
she
were
different
i
had
moments
of
almost
hating
her
until
one
day
not
long
ago
she
did
something
so
bewitchingly
kind
and
understanding
of
other
feelings
that
i
gave
up
it
was
clever
too
with
a
laugh
clever
and
daring
if
she
were
a
young
man
she
would
make
a
dashing
she
did
not
give
him
the
details
of
the
story
but
went
on
to
say
in
effect
what
she
had
said
to
betty
herself
of
the
inevitable
incidentalness
of
her
stay
in
the
country
if
she
had
not
evidently
come
to
stornham
this
year
with
a
purpose
she
would
have
spent
the
season
in
london
and
done
the
usual
thing
americans
were
generally
presented
promptly
if
they
had
any
position
sometimes
when
they
had
not
lady
alanby
had
heard
that
the
fact
that
she
was
with
her
sister
had
awakened
curiosity
and
people
were
talking
about
her
lady
alanby
said
in
that
dry
way
of
hers
that
the
arrival
of
an
unmarried
american
fortune
in
england
was
becoming
rather
like
the
visit
of
an
unmarried
royalty
people
ask
each
other
what
it
means
and
begin
to
arrange
for
it
so
far
only
the
women
have
come
but
lady
alanby
says
that
is
because
the
men
have
had
no
time
to
do
anything
but
stay
at
home
and
make
the
fortunes
she
believes
that
in
another
generation
there
will
be
a
male
leisure
class
and
then
it
will
swoop
down
too
and
marry
people
she
was
very
sharp
and
amusing
about
it
she
said
it
would
help
them
to
rid
themselves
of
a
plethora
of
wealth
and
keep
them
from
she
was
an
amiable
if
unsentimental
person
mary
lithcom
and
was
quite
without
ill
nature
expressing
the
consensus
of
public
opinion
these
young
women
came
to
the
country
with
something
practical
to
exchange
in
these
days
and
as
there
were
men
who
had
certain
equivalents
to
offer
so
also
there
were
men
who
had
none
and
whom
decency
should
cause
to
stand
aside
mount
dunstan
knew
that
when
she
had
said
who
is
there
who
is
suitable
any
shadow
of
a
thought
of
himself
as
being
in
the
running
had
not
crossed
her
mind
and
this
was
not
only
for
the
reasons
she
had
had
the
ready
composure
to
name
but
for
one
less
conquerable
later
having
left
mary
lithcom
he
decided
to
take
a
turn
by
himself
he
had
done
his
duty
as
a
masculine
guest
he
had
conversed
with
young
women
and
old
ones
had
danced
visited
gardens
and
greenhouses
and
taken
his
part
in
all
things
also
he
had
in
fact
reached
a
point
when
a
few
minutes
of
solitude
seemed
a
good
thing
he
found
himself
turning
into
the
clipped
laurel
walk
where
tommy
alanby
had
stood
with
jane
lithcom
and
he
went
to
the
end
of
it
and
stood
looking
out
on
the
view
look
at
the
turn
of
her
head
lady
mary
had
said
look
at
her
mouth
and
and
he
had
been
looking
at
them
the
whole
afternoon
not
because
he
had
intended
to
do
so
but
because
it
was
not
possible
to
prevent
himself
from
doing
it
this
was
one
of
the
ironies
of
fate
orthodox
doctrine
might
suggest
that
it
was
to
teach
him
that
his
past
rebellion
had
been
undue
orthodox
doctrine
was
ever
ready
with
these
soothing
little
explanations
he
had
raged
and
sulked
at
destiny
and
now
he
had
been
given
something
to
rage
for
no
one
knows
anything
about
it
until
it
takes
him
by
the
throat
he
was
thinking
and
until
it
happens
to
a
man
he
has
no
right
to
complain
i
was
not
starving
before
i
was
not
hungering
and
thirsting
in
sight
of
food
and
water
i
suppose
one
of
the
most
awful
things
in
the
world
is
to
feel
this
and
know
it
is
no
he
was
not
in
the
condition
to
reason
calmly
enough
to
see
that
there
might
be
one
chance
in
a
thousand
that
it
was
of
use
at
such
times
the
most
intelligent
of
men
and
women
lose
balance
and
mental
perspicacity
a
certain
degree
of
unreasoning
madness
possesses
them
they
see
too
much
and
too
little
there
were
it
was
true
a
thousand
chances
against
him
but
there
was
one
for
him
the
chance
that
selection
might
be
on
his
side
he
had
not
that
balance
of
thought
left
which
might
have
suggested
to
him
that
he
was
a
man
young
and
powerful
and
filled
with
an
immense
passion
which
might
count
for
something
all
he
saw
was
that
he
was
notably
in
the
position
of
the
men
whom
he
had
privately
disdained
when
they
helped
themselves
by
marriage
such
marriages
he
had
held
were
insults
to
the
manhood
of
any
man
and
the
womanhood
of
any
woman
in
such
unions
neither
party
could
respect
himself
or
his
companion
they
must
always
in
secret
doubt
each
other
fret
at
themselves
feel
distaste
for
the
whole
thing
even
if
a
man
loved
such
a
woman
and
the
feeling
was
mutual
to
whom
would
it
occur
to
believe
it
to
see
that
they
were
not
gross
and
contemptible
to
no
one
would
it
have
occurred
to
himself
that
such
an
extenuating
circumstance
was
possible
certainly
it
would
not
pride
and
obstinacy
it
might
be
but
he
could
not
yet
face
even
the
mere
thought
of
it
even
if
his
whole
position
had
not
been
grotesque
because
after
all
it
was
grotesque
that
he
should
even
argue
with
himself
she
before
his
eyes
and
the
eyes
of
all
others
the
most
desirable
of
women
people
dinning
it
in
one
ears
that
she
was
surrounded
by
besiegers
who
waited
for
her
to
hold
out
her
sceptre
and
he
well
what
was
he
not
that
his
mental
attitude
was
that
of
a
meek
and
humble
lover
who
felt
himself
unworthy
and
prostrated
himself
before
her
shrine
with
prayers
he
was
on
the
contrary
a
stout
and
obstinate
briton
finding
his
beliefs
made
as
naught
by
a
certain
obsession
an
intolerable
longing
which
wakened
with
him
in
the
morning
which
sank
into
troubled
sleep
with
him
at
night
the
longing
to
see
her
to
speak
to
her
to
stand
near
her
to
breathe
the
air
of
her
and
possessed
by
this
full
of
the
overpowering
strength
of
it
was
a
man
likely
to
go
to
a
woman
and
say
give
your
life
and
desirableness
to
me
and
incidentally
support
me
feed
me
clothe
me
keep
the
roof
over
my
head
as
if
i
were
an
impotent
beggar
no
by
god
he
said
if
she
thinks
of
me
at
all
it
shall
be
as
a
man
no
by
god
i
will
not
sink
to
that
a
moving
touch
of
colour
caught
his
eye
it
was
the
rose
of
a
parasol
seen
above
the
laurel
hedge
as
someone
turned
into
the
walk
he
knew
the
colour
of
it
and
expected
to
see
other
parasols
and
hear
voices
but
there
was
no
sound
and
unaccompanied
the
wonderful
moved
towards
him
the
usual
things
are
happening
to
me
was
his
thought
as
it
advanced
i
am
hot
and
cold
and
just
now
my
heart
leaped
like
a
rabbit
it
would
be
wise
to
walk
off
but
i
shall
not
do
it
i
shall
stay
here
because
i
am
no
longer
a
reasoning
being
i
suppose
that
a
horse
who
refuses
to
back
out
of
his
stall
when
his
stable
is
on
fire
feels
something
of
the
same
when
she
saw
him
she
made
an
pause
and
then
recovering
herself
came
forward
i
seem
to
have
come
in
search
of
you
she
said
you
ought
to
be
showing
someone
the
view
really
and
so
ought
shall
we
show
it
to
each
other
was
his
reply
and
she
sat
down
on
the
stone
seat
which
had
been
placed
for
the
comfort
of
view
lovers
i
am
a
little
tired
just
enough
to
feel
that
to
slink
away
for
a
moment
alone
would
be
agreeable
it
is
slinking
to
leave
rosalie
to
battle
with
half
the
county
but
i
shall
only
stay
a
few
she
sat
still
and
gazed
at
the
beautiful
lands
spread
before
her
but
there
was
no
stillness
in
her
mind
neither
was
there
stillness
in
his
he
did
not
look
at
the
view
but
at
her
and
he
was
asking
himself
what
he
should
be
saying
to
her
if
he
were
such
a
man
as
westholt
though
he
had
boldness
enough
he
knew
that
no
man
even
though
he
is
free
to
speak
the
best
and
most
passionate
thoughts
of
his
soul
could
be
sure
that
he
would
gain
what
he
desired
the
good
fortune
of
westholt
or
of
any
other
could
but
give
him
one
man
fair
chance
but
having
that
chance
he
knew
he
should
not
relinquish
it
soon
there
swept
back
into
his
mind
the
story
of
the
marriage
of
his
ancestor
red
godwyn
and
he
laughed
low
in
spite
of
himself
miss
vanderpoel
looked
up
at
him
quickly
please
tell
me
about
it
if
it
is
very
amusing
she
said
i
wonder
if
it
will
amuse
you
was
his
answer
do
you
like
savage
romance
very
it
might
seem
a
propos
de
rien
but
he
did
not
care
in
the
least
he
wanted
to
hear
what
she
would
say
an
ancestor
of
mine
a
certain
red
godwyn
was
a
barbarian
immensely
to
my
taste
he
became
enamoured
of
rumours
of
the
beauty
of
the
daughter
and
heiress
of
his
bitterest
enemy
in
his
day
when
one
wanted
a
thing
one
rode
forth
with
axe
and
spear
to
fight
for
a
simple
and
alluring
method
commented
betty
what
was
her
name
she
leaned
in
light
ease
against
the
stone
back
of
her
seat
the
rose
light
cast
by
her
parasol
faintly
flushed
her
the
silence
of
their
retreat
seemed
accentuated
by
its
background
of
music
from
the
gardens
they
smiled
a
second
bravely
into
each
other
eyes
then
their
glances
became
entangled
as
they
had
done
for
a
moment
when
they
had
stood
together
in
mount
dunstan
park
for
one
moment
each
had
been
held
prisoner
then
now
it
was
for
longer
alys
of
the
betty
tried
to
release
herself
but
could
not
sometimes
the
sea
is
grey
she
said
his
own
eyes
were
still
in
hers
hers
were
the
colour
of
the
sea
on
a
day
when
the
sun
shines
on
it
and
there
are
large
clouds
floating
in
the
blue
above
they
sparkled
and
were
often
like
bluebells
under
bluebells
under
water
sounds
entrancing
said
betty
he
caught
his
breath
slightly
they
were
entrancing
he
said
that
was
evidently
the
devil
of
it
saving
your
i
have
never
objected
to
the
devil
said
betty
he
is
an
energetic
creature
and
paints
himself
an
honest
black
please
tell
me
the
red
godwyn
went
forth
and
after
a
bloody
fight
took
his
castle
if
we
still
lived
in
like
simple
honest
times
i
should
take
dunholm
castle
in
the
same
way
he
also
took
alys
of
the
eyes
and
bore
her
away
from
such
incidents
developed
the
germs
of
the
desire
for
female
suffrage
miss
vanderpoel
observed
gently
the
interest
of
the
story
lies
in
the
fact
that
apparently
the
savage
was
either
epicure
or
sentimentalist
or
both
he
did
not
treat
the
lady
ill
he
shut
her
in
a
tower
chamber
overlooking
his
courtyard
and
after
allowing
her
three
days
to
weep
he
began
his
barbarian
wooing
arraying
himself
in
splendour
he
ordered
her
to
appear
before
him
he
sat
upon
the
dais
in
his
banquet
hall
his
retainers
gathered
about
him
a
great
feast
spread
in
archaic
english
we
are
told
that
the
board
groaned
beneath
the
weight
of
golden
trenchers
and
flagons
minstrels
played
and
sang
while
he
displayed
all
his
they
do
it
yet
said
miss
vanderpoel
in
london
and
new
york
and
other
the
next
day
attended
by
his
followers
he
took
her
with
him
to
ride
over
his
lands
when
she
returned
to
her
tower
chamber
she
had
learned
how
powerful
and
great
a
chieftain
he
was
she
softely
and
was
attended
by
many
maidens
but
she
had
no
entertainment
but
to
look
out
upon
the
great
green
court
there
he
arranged
games
and
trials
of
strength
and
skill
and
she
saw
him
bigger
stronger
and
more
splendid
than
any
other
man
he
did
not
even
lift
his
eyes
to
her
window
he
also
sent
her
daily
a
rich
how
long
did
this
go
on
three
months
at
the
end
of
that
time
he
commanded
her
presence
again
in
his
banquet
hall
he
told
her
the
gates
were
opened
the
drawbridge
down
and
an
escort
waiting
to
take
her
back
to
her
father
lands
if
she
what
did
she
do
she
looked
at
him
long
and
long
she
turned
proudly
away
in
the
eyes
were
heavy
and
stormy
tears
which
seeing
ah
he
saw
them
from
miss
vanderpoel
yes
and
seizing
her
in
his
arms
caught
her
to
his
breast
calling
for
a
priest
to
make
them
one
within
the
hour
i
am
quoting
the
chronicle
i
was
fifteen
when
i
read
it
it
is
spirited
said
betty
and
red
godwyn
was
almost
modern
in
his
while
professing
composure
and
lightness
of
mood
the
spell
which
works
between
two
creatures
of
opposite
sex
when
in
such
case
wrought
in
them
and
made
them
feel
awkward
and
stiff
when
each
is
held
apart
from
the
other
by
fate
or
will
or
circumstance
the
spell
is
a
stupefying
thing
deadening
even
the
clearness
of
sight
and
wit
i
must
slink
back
now
betty
said
rising
will
you
slink
back
with
me
to
give
me
countenance
i
have
greatly
liked
red
so
it
occurred
that
when
nigel
anstruthers
saw
them
again
it
was
as
they
crossed
the
lawn
together
and
people
looked
up
from
ices
and
cups
of
tea
to
follow
their
slow
progress
with
questioning
or
approving
eyes
chapter
xxxv
the
tidal
wave
there
was
only
one
man
to
speak
to
and
it
being
the
nature
of
the
beast
so
he
harshly
put
it
to
himself
to
be
absolutely
impelled
to
speech
at
such
times
mount
dunstan
laid
bare
his
breast
to
him
tearing
aside
all
the
coverings
pride
would
have
folded
about
him
the
man
was
of
course
penzance
and
the
laying
bare
was
done
the
evening
after
the
story
of
red
godwyn
had
been
told
in
the
laurel
walk
they
had
driven
home
together
in
a
profound
silence
the
elder
man
as
deep
in
thought
as
the
younger
one
penzance
was
thinking
that
there
was
a
calmness
in
having
reached
sixty
and
in
knowing
that
the
pain
and
hunger
of
earlier
years
would
not
tear
one
again
and
yet
he
himself
was
not
untorn
by
that
which
shook
the
man
for
whom
his
affection
had
grown
year
by
year
it
was
evidently
very
bad
very
bad
indeed
he
wondered
if
he
would
speak
of
it
and
wished
he
would
not
because
he
himself
had
much
to
say
in
answer
but
because
he
knew
that
speech
would
be
better
than
hard
silence
stay
with
me
mount
dunstan
said
as
they
drove
through
the
avenue
to
the
house
i
want
you
to
dine
with
me
and
sit
and
talk
late
i
am
not
sleeping
they
often
dined
together
and
the
vicar
not
infrequently
slept
at
the
mount
for
mere
companionship
sake
sometimes
they
read
sometimes
went
over
accounts
planned
economies
and
balanced
expenditures
a
chamber
still
called
the
chaplain
room
was
always
kept
in
readiness
it
had
been
used
in
long
past
days
when
a
household
chaplain
had
sat
below
the
salt
and
left
his
patron
table
before
the
sweets
were
served
they
dined
together
this
night
almost
as
silently
as
they
had
driven
homeward
and
after
the
meal
they
went
and
sat
alone
in
the
library
the
huge
room
was
never
more
than
dimly
lighted
and
the
corners
seemed
more
darkling
than
usual
in
the
insufficient
illumination
of
the
far
from
brilliant
lamps
mount
dunstan
after
standing
upon
the
hearth
for
a
few
minutes
smoking
a
pipe
which
would
have
compared
ill
with
old
doby
sunday
splendour
left
his
coffee
cup
upon
the
mantel
and
began
to
tramp
up
and
down
out
of
the
dim
light
into
the
shadows
back
out
of
the
shadows
into
the
poor
light
you
know
he
said
what
i
think
about
most
things
you
know
what
i
i
think
i
you
know
what
i
feel
about
englishmen
who
brand
themselves
as
half
men
and
marked
merchandise
by
selling
themselves
and
their
houses
and
their
blood
to
foreign
women
who
can
buy
them
you
know
how
savage
i
have
been
at
the
mere
thought
of
it
and
how
i
have
sworn
yes
i
know
what
you
have
sworn
said
penzance
it
struck
him
that
mount
dunstan
shook
and
tossed
his
head
rather
like
a
bull
about
to
charge
an
enemy
you
know
how
i
have
felt
myself
perfectly
within
my
rights
when
i
blackguarded
such
men
and
sneered
at
such
women
taking
it
for
granted
that
each
was
merchandise
of
his
or
her
kind
and
beneath
contempt
i
am
not
a
man
but
i
have
used
gross
words
and
rough
ones
to
describe
i
have
heard
mount
dunstan
threw
back
his
head
with
a
big
harsh
laugh
he
came
out
of
the
shadow
and
stood
still
well
he
said
i
am
in
love
as
much
in
love
as
any
lunatic
ever
was
with
the
daughter
of
reuben
vanderpoel
there
you
are
and
there
am
it
has
seemed
to
me
penzance
answered
that
it
was
almost
my
condition
is
such
that
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
be
inevitable
in
the
case
of
any
man
when
i
see
another
man
look
at
her
my
blood
races
through
my
veins
with
an
awful
fear
and
a
wicked
heat
that
will
show
you
the
point
i
have
he
walked
over
to
the
mantelpiece
and

his
pipe
down
with

turning
over

of
life
he
said
i
have
come
upon
the
book
of
that
is
true
penzance
said
until
one
has
come
upon
it
one
is
an
inchoate
fool
mount
dunstan
went
on
and
afterwards
one
is
for
a
time
at
least
a
sort
of
madman
raving
to
one
self
either
in
or
out
of
a
straitjacket
as
the
case
may
be
i
am
wearing
the
jacket
worse
luck
do
you
know
anything
of
the
state
of
a
man
who
can
not
utter
the
most
ordinary
words
to
a
woman
without
being
conscious
that
he
is
making
mad
love
to
her
this
afternoon
i
found
myself
telling
miss
vanderpoel
the
story
of
red
godwyn
and
alys
of
the
eyes
i
did
not
make
a
single
statement
having
any
connection
with
myself
but
throughout
i
was
calling
on
her
to
think
of
herself
and
of
me
as
of
those
two
i
saw
her
in
my
own
arms
with
the
tears
of
alys
on
her
lashes
i
was
making
mad
love
though
she
was
unconscious
of
my
doing
how
do
you
know
she
was
unconscious
remarked
penzance
you
are
a
very
strong
mount
dunstan
short
laugh
was
even
a
little
awful
because
it
meant
so
much
he
let
his
forehead
drop
a
moment
on
to
his
arms
as
they
rested
on
the
mantelpiece
oh
my
god
he
said
but
the
next
instant
his
head
lifted
itself
it
is
the
mystery
of
the
world
this
thing
a
tidal
wave
gathering
itself
mountain
high
and
crashing
down
upon
one
helplessness
might
be
as
easily
defied
it
is
supposed
to
disperse
i
believe
that
has
been
said
so
often
that
there
must
be
truth
in
it
in
twenty
or
thirty
or
forty
years
one
is
told
one
will
have
got
over
it
but
one
must
live
through
the
years
one
must
live
through
them
and
the
chief
feature
of
madness
is
that
one
is
convinced
that
they
will
last
go
on
said
penzance
because
he
had
paused
and
stood
biting
his
lip
say
all
that
you
feel
inclined
to
say
it
is
the
best
thing
you
can
do
i
have
never
gone
through
this
myself
but
i
have
seen
and
known
the
amazingness
of
it
for
many
years
i
have
seen
it
come
and
can
you
imagine
mount
dunstan
said
that
the
most
damnable
thought
of
all
when
a
man
is
passing
through
it
is
the
possibility
of
its
going
anything
else
rather
than
the
knowledge
that
years
could
change
or
death
could
end
it
eternity
seems
only
to
offer
space
for
it
one
knows
but
one
does
not
believe
it
does
something
to
one
no
scientist
howsoever
profound
has
ever
discovered
what
the
vicar
mused
aloud
the
book
of
revelations
has
shown
to
me
how
how
magnificent
life
might
be
mount
dunstan
clenched
and
unclenched
his
hands
his
eyes
flashing
magnificent
that
is
the
word
to
go
to
her
on
equal
ground
to
take
her
hands
and
speak
one
passion
as
one
would
as
her
eyes
answered
oh
one
would
know
to
bring
her
home
to
this
place
having
made
it
as
it
once
was
to
live
with
her
here
to
be
with
her
as
the
sun
rose
and
set
and
the
seasons
changed
with
the
joy
of
life
filling
each
of
them
she
is
the
joy
of
life
the
very
heart
of
it
you
see
where
i
am
you
see
yes
penzance
answered
he
saw
and
bowed
his
head
and
mount
dunstan
knew
he
wished
him
to
continue
sometimes
of
late
it
has
been
too
much
for
me
and
i
have
given
free
rein
to
my
fancy
knowing
that
there
could
never
be
more
than
fancy
i
was
doing
it
this
afternoon
as
i
watched
her
move
about
among
the
people
and
mary
lithcom
began
to
talk
about
he
smiled
a
grim
smile
perhaps
it
was
an
intervention
of
the
gods
to
drag
me
down
from
my
impious
heights
she
was
quite
unconscious
that
she
was
driving
home
facts
like
nails
the
facts
that
every
man
who
wanted
money
wanted
reuben
vanderpoel
daughter
and
that
the
young
lady
not
being
dull
was
not
unaware
of
the
obvious
truth
and
that
men
with
prizes
to
offer
were
ready
to
offer
them
in
a
proper
manner
also
that
she
was
only
a
brilliant
bird
of
passage
who
in
a
few
months
would
be
caught
in
the
dazzling
net
of
the
great
world
and
that
even
lord
westholt
and
dunholm
castle
were
not
quite
what
she
might
expect
lady
mary
was
sincerely
interested
she
drove
it
home
in
her
ardour
she
told
me
to
look
at
her
to
look
at
her
mouth
and
chin
and
eyelashes
and
to
make
note
of
what
she
stood
for
in
a
crowd
of
ordinary
people
i
could
have
laughed
aloud
with
rage
and
penzance
was
resting
his
forehead
on
his
hand
his
elbow
on
his
chair
arm
this
is
profound
unhappiness
he
said
it
is
profound
mount
dunstan
answered
by
a
brusque
gesture
but
it
will
pass
away
went
on
penzance
and
not
as
you
fear
it
must
in
answer
to
another
gesture
fiercely
impatient
not
that
way
some
day
or
night
you
will
stand
here
together
and
you
will
tell
her
all
you
have
told
me
i
know
it
will
be
what
mount
dunstan
cried
out
but
the
words
had
been
spoken
with
such
absolute
conviction
that
he
felt
himself
become
pale
it
was
with
the
same
conviction
that
penzance
went
on
i
have
spent
my
quiet
life
in
thinking
of
the
forces
for
which
we
find
no
explanation
of
the
causes
of
which
we
only
see
the
effects
long
ago
in
looking
at
you
in
one
of
my
pondering
moments
i
said
to
myself
that
you
were
of
the
primeval
force
which
can
not
lose
its
way
which
sweeps
a
clear
pathway
for
itself
as
it
moves
and
which
can
not
be
held
back
i
said
to
you
just
now
that
because
you
are
a
strong
man
you
can
not
be
sure
that
a
woman
you
are
even
in
spite
of
yourself
making
mad
love
to
is
unconscious
that
you
are
doing
it
you
do
not
know
what
your
strength
lies
in
i
do
not
the
woman
does
not
but
we
must
all
feel
it
whether
we
comprehend
it
or
no
you
said
of
this
fine
creature
some
time
since
that
she
was
life
and
you
have
just
said
again
something
of
the
same
kind
it
is
quite
true
she
is
life
and
the
joy
of
it
you
are
two
strong
forces
and
you
are
drawing
he
rose
from
his
chair
and
going
to
mount
dunstan
put
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
his
fine
old
face
singularly
rapt
and
glowing
she
is
drawing
you
and
you
are
drawing
her
and
each
is
too
strong
to
release
the
other
i
believe
that
to
be
true
both
bodies
and
souls
do
it
they
are
not
separate
things
they
move
on
their
way
as
the
stars
do
they
move
on
their
as
he
spoke
mount
dunstan
eyes
looked
into
his
fixedly
then
they
turned
aside
and
looked
down
upon
the
mantel
against
which
he
was
leaning
he
aimlessly
picked
up
his
pipe
and
laid
it
down
again
he
was
paler
than
before
but
he
said
no
single
word
you
think
your
reasons
for
holding
aloof
from
her
are
the
reasons
of
a
penzance
voice
sounded
to
him
remote
they
are
the
reasons
of
a
man
pride
but
that
is
not
the
strongest
thing
in
the
world
it
only
imagines
it
is
you
think
that
you
can
not
go
to
her
as
a
luckier
man
could
you
think
nothing
shall
force
you
to
speak
ask
yourself
why
it
is
because
you
believe
that
to
show
your
heart
would
be
to
place
yourself
in
the
humiliating
position
of
a
man
who
might
seem
to
her
and
to
the
world
to
be
a
base
an
impudent
pushing
base
fellow
thrust
in
mount
dunstan
fiercely
one
of
a
vulgar
lot
a
thing
fancying
even
its
beggary
worth
buying
what
has
a
man
whose
very
name
is
hung
with
tattered
ugliness
to
offer
penzance
hand
was
still
on
his
shoulder
and
his
look
at
him
was
long
his
very
pride
he
said
at
last
his
very
obstinacy
and
haughty
stubborn
determination
those
broken
because
the
other
feeling
is
the
stronger
and
overcomes
him
a
flush
leaped
to
mount
dunstan
forehead
he
set
both
elbows
on
the
mantel
and
let
his
forehead
fall
on
his
clenched
fists
and
the
savage
briton
rose
in
him
no
he
said
passionately
by
god
no
you
say
that
said
the
older
man
because
you
have
not
yet
reached
the
end
of
your
tether
unhappy
as
you
are
you
are
not
unhappy
enough
of
the
two
you
love
yourself
the
more
your
pride
and
your
yes
between
his
teeth
i
suppose
i
retain
yet
a
sort
of
respect
and
affection
for
my
pride
may
god
leave
it
to
me
penzance
felt
himself
curiously
exalted
he
knew
himself
unreasoningly
passing
through
an
oddly
unpractical
uplifted
moment
in
whose
impelling
he
singularly
believed
you
are
drawing
her
and
she
is
drawing
you
he
said
perhaps
you
drew
each
other
across
seas
you
will
stand
here
together
and
you
will
tell
her
of
this
on
this
very
mount
dunstan
changed
his
position
and
laughed
roughly
as
if
to
rouse
himself
he
threw
out
his
arm
in
a
big
uneasy
gesture
taking
in
the
room
oh
come
he
said
you
talk
like
a
seer
look
about
you
look
i
am
to
bring
her
here
if
it
is
the
primeval
thing
she
will
not
care
why
should
she
she
bring
a
life
like
hers
to
this
or
perhaps
you
mean
that
her
own
wealth
might
make
her
surroundings
becoming
that
a
man
would
endure
that
if
it
is
the
primeval
thing
you
would
not
care
you
would
have
forgotten
that
you
two
had
ever
lived
an
hour
he
spoke
with
a
deep
moved
gravity
almost
as
if
he
were
speaking
of
the
first
titan
building
of
the
earth
mount
dunstan
staring
at
his
delicate
insistent
elderly
face
tried
to
laugh
again
and
failed
because
the
effort
seemed
actually
irreverent
it
was
a
singular
hypnotic
moment
indeed
he
himself
was
hypnotised
a
flashlight
of
new
vision
blazed
before
him
and
left
him
dumb
he
took
up
his
pipe
hurriedly
and
with
still
unsteady
fingers
began
to
refill
it
when
it
was
filled
he
lighted
it
and
then
without
a
word
of
answer
left
the
hearth
and
began
to
tramp
up
and
down
the
room
again
out
of
the
dim
light
into
the
shadows
back
out
of
the
shadows
and
into
the
dim
light
again
his
brow
working
and
his
teeth
holding
hard
his
amber
mouthpiece
the
morning
awakening
of
a
normal
healthy
human
creature
should
be
a
joyous
thing
after
the
soul
long
hours
of
release
from
the
burden
of
the
body
its
long
hours
spent
one
can
only
say
in
awe
at
the
mystery
of
it
away
away
in
flight
perhaps
on
broad
tireless
wings
beating
softly
in
fair
far
skies
breathing
pure
life
to
be
brought
back
to
renew
the
strength
of
each
dawning
day
after
these
hours
of
quiescence
of
limb
and
nerve
and
brain
the
morning
life
returning
should
unseal
for
the
body
clear
eyes
of
peace
at
least
in
time
to
come
this
will
be
so
when
the
soul
wings
are
stronger
the
body
more
attuned
to
infinite
law
and
the
race
a
greater
power
but
as
yet
it
often
seems
as
though
the
winged
thing
came
back
a
lagging
and
reluctant
rebel
against
its
fate
and
the
chain
which
draws
it
back
a
prisoner
to
its
toil
it
had
seemed
so
often
to
mount
dunstan
oftener
than
not
youth
should
not
know
such
awakening
he
was
well
aware
but
he
had
known
it
sometimes
even
when
he
had
been
a
child
and
since
his
return
from
his
struggle
in
america
the
dull
and
reluctant
facing
of
the
day
had
become
a
habit
yet
on
the
morning
after
his
talk
with
his
friend
the
curious
uplifted
unpractical
talk
which
had
seemed
to
hypnotise
him
he
knew
when
he
opened
his
eyes
to
the
light
that
he
had
awakened
as
a
man
should
awake
with
an
unreasoning
sense
of
pleasure
in
the
life
and
health
of
his
own
body
as
he
stretched
mighty
limbs
strong
after
the
night
rest
and
feeling
that
there
was
work
to
be
done
it
was
all
unreasoning
there
was
no
more
to
be
done
than
on
those
other
days
which
he
had
wakened
to
with
bitterness
because
they
seemed
useless
and
empty
of
any
worth
but
this
morning
the
mere
light
of
the
sun
was
of
use
the
rustle
of
the
small
breeze
in
the
leaves
the
soft
floating
past
of
the
white
clouds
the
mere
fact
that
the
great
stately
house
was
his
own
that
he
could
tramp
far
over
lands
which
were
his
heritage
unfed
though
they
might
be
and
that
the
very
rustics
who
would
pass
him
in
the
lanes
were
so
to
speak
his
own
people
that
he
had
name
life
even
the
common
thing
of
hunger
for
his
morning
food
it
was
all
of
use
an
alluring
picture
of
a
certain
deep
clear
bathing
pool
in
the
park
rose
before
him
it
had
not
called
to
him
for
many
a
day
and
now
he
saw
its
dark
blueness
gleam
between
flags
and
green
rushes
in
its
encircling
thickness
of
shrubs
and
trees
he
sprang
from
his
bed
and
in
a
few
minutes
was
striding
across
the
grass
of
the
park
his
towels
over
his
arm
his
head
thrown
back
as
he
drank
in
the
freshness
of
the
air
it
was
scented
with
dew
and
grass
and
the
breath
of
waking
trees
and
growing
things
early
twitters
and
thrills
were
to
be
heard
here
and
there
insisting
on
morning
joyfulness
rabbits
frisked
about
among
the
hummocks
of
their
warren
and
as
he
passed
scuttled
back
into
their
holes
with
a
whisking
of
short
white
tails
at
which
he
laughed
with
friendly
amusement
cropping
stags
lifted
their
antlered
heads
and
fawns
with
dappled
sides
and
immense
lustrous
eyes
gazed
at
him
without
actual
fear
even
while
they
sidled
closer
to
their
mothers
a
skylark
springing
suddenly
from
the
grass
a
few
yards
from
his
feet
made
him
stop
short
once
and
stand
looking
upward
and
listening
who
could
pass
by
a
skylark
at
five
on
a
summer
morning
the
little
heavenly
circling
and
wheeling
showering
down
diamonds
showering
down
pearls
from
its
tiny
pulsating
trilling
throat
do
you
know
why
they
sing
like
that
it
is
because
all
but
the
joy
of
things
has
been
kept
hidden
from
them
they
knew
nothing
but
life
and
flight
and
mating
and
the
gold
of
the
sun
so
they
that
she
had
once
said
he
listened
until
the
jewelled
rain
seemed
to
have
fallen
into
his
soul
then
he
went
on
his
way
smiling
as
he
knew
he
had
never
smiled
in
his
life
before
he
knew
it
because
he
realised
that
he
had
never
before
felt
the
same
vigorous
light
normality
of
spirit
the
same
sense
of
being
as
other
men
it
was
as
though
something
had
swept
a
great
clear
space
about
him
and
having
room
for
air
he
breathed
deep
and
was
glad
of
the
commonest
gifts
of
being
the
bathing
pool
had
been
the
greatest
pleasure
of
his
boyhood
no
one
knew
which
long
passed
away
mount
dunstan
had
made
it
the
oldest
villager
had
told
him
that
it
had
allus
ben
there
even
in
his
father
time
since
he
himself
had
known
it
he
had
seen
that
it
was
kept
at
its
best
its
dark
blue
depths
reflected
in
their
pellucid
clearness
the
water
plants
growing
at
its
edge
and
the
enclosing
shrubs
and
trees
the
turf
bordering
it
was
and
green
and
a
few
led
down
to
the
water
birds
came
there
to
drink
and
bathe
and
preen
and
dress
their
feathers
he
knew
there
were
often
nests
in
the
bushes
sometimes
the
nests
of
nightingales
who
filled
the
soft
darkness
or
moonlight
of
early
june
with
the
wonderfulness
of
nesting
song
sometimes
a
straying
fawn
poked
in
a
tender
nose
and
after
drinking
delicately
stole
away
as
if
it
knew
itself
a
trespasser
to
undress
and
plunge
headlong
into
the
dark
sapphire
water
was
a
rapturous
thing
he
swam
swiftly
and
slowly
by
turns
he
floated
looking
upward
at
heaven
blue
listening
to
birds
song
and
inhaling
all
the
fragrance
of
the
early
day
strength
grew
in
him
and
life
pulsed
as
the
water
lapped
his
limbs
he
found
himself
thinking
with
pleasure
of
a
long
walk
he
intended
to
take
to
see
a
farmer
he
must
talk
to
about
his
hop
gardens
he
found
himself
thinking
with
pleasure
of
other
things
as
simple
and
common
to
everyday
life
such
things
as
he
ordinarily
faced
merely
because
he
must
since
he
could
not
afford
an
experienced
bailiff
he
was
his
own
bailiff
his
own
steward
merely
he
had
often
thought
an
unsuccessful
farmer
of
lands
but
this
morning
neither
he
nor
they
seemed
so
starved
and
for
no
reason
there
was
a
future
of
some
sort
he
emerged
from
his
pool
glowing
the
turf
feeling
like
velvet
beneath
his
feet
a
fine
light
in
his
eyes
yes
he
said
throwing
out
his
arms
in
a
lordly
stretch
of
physical
it
might
be
a
magnificent
thing
mere
strong
living
this
is
chapter
xxxvi
by
the
roadside
everywhere
his
breakfast
and
the
talk
over
it
with
penzance
seemed
good
things
it
suddenly
had
become
worth
while
to
discuss
the
approaching
hop
harvest
and
the
yearly
influx
of
the
hop
pickers
from
london
yesterday
the
subject
had
appeared
discouraging
enough
the
great
hop
gardens
of
the
estate
had
been
in
times
past
its
most
prolific
source
of
agricultural
revenue
and
the
boast
and
wonder
of
the
county
the
neglect
and
scant
food
of
the
lean
years
had
cost
them
their
reputation
each
season
they
had
needed
smaller
bands
of
hoppers
and
their
standard
had
been
lowered
it
had
been
his
habit
to
think
of
them
gloomily
as
of
hopeless
and
irretrievable
loss
because
this
morning
for
a
remote
reason
the
pulse
of
life
beat
strong
in
him
he
was
taking
a
new
view
might
not
study
of
the
subject
constant
attention
and
the
application
of
all
available
resource
to
one
end
produce
appreciable
results
the
idea
presented
itself
in
the
form
of
a
thing
worth
thinking
of
it
would
provide
an
outlook
and
give
one
work
to
do
he
put
it
to
his
companion
to
have
a
roof
over
one
head
a
sound
body
and
work
to
do
is
not
so
bad
such
things
form
the
whole
of
selden
cheerful
aim
his
spirit
is
alight
within
me
i
will
walk
over
and
talk
to
bolter
was
a
farmer
whose
struggle
to
make
ends
meet
was
almost
too
much
for
him
holdings
whose
owners
either
through
neglect
or
lack
of
money
have
failed
to
do
their
duty
as
landlords
in
the
matter
of
repairs
of
farmhouses
outbuildings
fences
and
other
things
gradually
fall
into
poor
hands
resourceful
and
prosperous
farmers
do
not
care
to
hold
lands
under
unprosperous
landlords
there
were
farms
lying
vacant
on
the
mount
dunstan
estate
there
were
others
whose
tenants
were
uncertain
rent
payers
or
slipshod
workers
or
dishonest
in
small
ways
waste
or
sale
of
the
fertiliser
which
should
have
been
given
to
the
soil
as
its
due
neglect
in
the
case
of
things
whose
decay
meant
depreciation
of
property
and
expense
to
the
landlord
were
dishonesties
but
mount
dunstan
knew
that
if
he
turned
out
thorn
and
fittle
whom
no
watching
could
wholly
frustrate
in
their
tricks
under
mount
farm
and
oakfield
rise
would
stand
empty
for
many
a
year
but
for
his
poverty
bolter
would
have
been
a
good
tenant
enough
he
was
in
trouble
now
because
though
his
hops
promised
well
he
faced
difficulties
in
the
matter
of
last
year
he
had
not
been
able
to
pay
satisfactory
prices
in
return
for
labour
and
as
a
result
the
prospect
of
securing
good
workers
was
an
unpromising
one
the
hordes
of
men
women
and
children
who
flock
year
after
year
to
the
districts
know
each
other
they
learn
also
which
may
be
called
the
good
neighbourhoods
and
which
the
bad
the
gardens
whose
holders
are
considered
satisfactory
as
masters
and
those
who
are
undesirable
they
know
by
experience
or
report
where
the
best
huts
are
provided
where
tents
are
supplied
and
where
one
must
get
along
as
one
can
generally
the
regular
flocks
are
under
a
captain
who
gathers
his
followers
each
season
manages
them
and
looks
after
their
interests
and
their
employers
in
some
cases
the
same
captain
brings
his
regiment
to
the
same
gardens
year
after
year
and
ends
by
counting
himself
as
of
the
soil
and
almost
of
the
family
of
his
employer
each
hard
winter
they
fight
through
in
their
east
end
courts
and
streets
they
look
forward
to
the
weeks
spent
between
long
narrow
green
groves
of
tall
garlanded
poles
whose
wreathings
hang
thick
with
fresh
and
hop
clusters
children
play
in
dingy
rooms
and
alleys
and
talk
to
each
other
of
days
when
the
sun
shone
hot
and
birds
were
singing
and
flowers
smelling
sweet
in
the
hedgerows
of
others
when
the
rain
streamed
down
and
made
mud
of
the
soft
earth
and
yet
there
was
pleasure
in
the
gipsying
life
and
high
cheer
in
the
fire
of
sticks
built
in
the
field
by
some
bold
spirit
who
hung
over
it
a
tin
kettle
to
boil
for
tea
they
never
forgot
the
gentry
they
had
caught
sight
of
riding
or
driving
by
on
the
road
the
parson
who
came
to
talk
and
the
occasional
groups
of
ladies
from
the
great
house
who
came
into
the
gardens
to
walk
about
and
look
at
the
bins
and
ask
queer
questions
in
their
voices
they
never
knew
anything
and
they
always
seemed
to
be
entertained
sometimes
there
were
enterprising
laughing
ones
who
asked
to
be
shown
how
to
strip
the
hops
into
the
bins
and
after
being
shown
played
at
the
work
for
a
little
while
taking
off
their
gloves
and
showing
white
fingers
with
rings
on
they
always
looked
as
if
they
had
just
been
washed
and
as
if
all
of
their
clothes
were
fresh
from
the
tub
and
when
anyone
stood
near
them
it
was
observable
that
they
smelt
nice
generally
they
gave
pennies
to
the
children
before
they
left
the
garden
and
sometimes
shillings
to
the
women
the
hop
picking
was
in
fact
a
wonderful
blend
of
work
and
holiday
combined
mount
dunstan
had
liked
the
hopping
from
his
first
memories
of
it
he
could
recall
his
sensations
of
welcoming
a
renewal
of
interesting
things
when
season
after
season
he
had
begun
to
mark
the
early
stragglers
on
the
road
the
stragglers
were
not
of
the
class
gathered
under
captains
they
were
derelicts
tramps
who
spent
their
summers
on
the
highways
and
their
winters
in
such
workhouses
as
would
take
them
in
tinkers
who
differ
from
the
tramps
only
because
sometimes
they
owned
a
rickety
cart
full
of
strange
household
goods
and
drunken
perambulators
piled
with
dirty
bundles
and
babies
these
last
propelled
by
robust
or
slatternly
women
who
sat
by
the
small
roadside
fire
stirring
the
battered
pot
or
tending
the
battered
kettle
when
resting
time
had
come
and
food
must
be
cooked
gipsies
there
were
who
had
cooking
fires
also
and
hobbled
horses
cropping
the
grass
now
and
then
appeared
a
grand
one
who
was
rumoured
to
be
a
lee
and
therefore
royal
and
who
came
and
lived
regally
in
a
gaily
painted
caravan
during
the
late
summer
weeks
one
began
to
see
slouching
figures
tramping
along
the
high
road
at
intervals
these
were
men
who
were
old
men
who
were
and
some
who
were
young
all
of
them
more
or
less
or
ragged
occasionally
one
was
to
be
seen
in
heavy
beery
slumber
under
the
hedgerow
or
lying
on
the
grass
smoking
lazily
or
with
painful
thrift
cobbling
up
a
hole
in
a
garment
such
as
these
were
drifting
in
early
that
they
might
be
on
the
ground
when
pickers
were
wanted
they
were
the
forerunners
of
the
regular
army
on
his
walk
to
west
ways
the
farm
bolter
lived
on
mount
dunstan
passed
two
or
three
of
these
strays
they
were
the
usual
flotsam
and
jetsam
but
on
the
roadside
near
a
hop
garden
he
came
upon
a
group
of
an
aspect
so
unusual
that
it
attracted
his
attention
its
unusualness
consisted
in
its
air
of
exceeding
bustling
cheerfulness
it
was
a
domestic
group
of
the
most
luckless
type
and
ragged
dirty
and
worn
by
an
evidently
long
tramp
might
well
have
been
expected
to
look
forlorn
discouraged
and
out
of
spirits
a
slouching
father
of
five
children
one
plainly
but
a
few
weeks
old
and
slung
in
a
dirty
shawl
at
its
mother
breast
an
unhealthy
looking
slattern
mother
two
ancient
perambulators
one
piled
with
dingy
bundles
and
cooking
utensils
the
eldest
girl
unpacking
things
and
keeping
an
eye
at
the
same
time
on
the
two
youngest
who
were
neither
of
them
old
enough
to
be
steady
on
their
feet
the
gleefully
aiding
the
slouching
father
to
build
the
wayside
fire
the
mother
sat
upon
the
grass
nursing
her
baby
and
staring
about
her
with
an
expression
at
once
stupefied
and
illuminated
by
some
temporary
bliss
even
the
slouching
father
was
grinning
as
if
good
luck
had
befallen
him
and
the
two
youngest
were
tumbling
about
with
squeals
of
good
cheer
this
was
not
the
humour
in
which
such
a
group
usually
dropped
wearily
on
the
grass
at
the
wayside
to
eat
its
meagre
and
uninviting
meal
and
rest
its
dragging
limbs
as
he
drew
near
mount
dunstan
saw
that
at
the
woman
side
there
stood
a
basket
full
of
food
and
a
can
full
of
milk
ordinarily
he
would
have
passed
on
but
perhaps
because
of
the
human
glow
the
morning
had
brought
him
he
stopped
and
spoke
have
you
come
for
the
hopping
he
asked
the
man
touched
his
forehead
apparently
not
conscious
that
the
grin
was
yet
on
his
face
yes
sir
he
answered
how
far
have
you
walked
a
good
fifty
miles
since
we
started
sir
it
took
us
a
good
bit
we
was
pretty
done
up
when
we
stopped
here
but
we
a
wonderful
piece
of
good
and
his
grin
broadened
immensely
i
am
glad
to
hear
that
said
mount
dunstan
the
good
luck
was
plainly
of
a
nature
to
have
excited
them
greatly
chance
good
luck
did
not
happen
to
people
like
themselves
they
were
in
the
state
of
mind
which
in
their
class
can
only
be
relieved
by
talk
the
woman
broke
in
her
weak
mouth
and
chin
quite
unsteady
seems
like
it
ca
be
true
sir
she
said
i
only
just
come
out
of
the
union
after
this
one
signifying
the
new
baby
at
her
breast
i
was
fit
to
drag
along
day
after
day
we
to
stop
i
was
near
fainting
she
looked
fair
white
when
she
sat
down
put
in
the
man
like
she
was
goin
and
that
very
minute
said
the
woman
a
young
lady
came
by
on
an
the
minute
she
sees
me
she
stops
her
an
gets
i
never
seen
nothing
like
the
quick
way
she
done
it
said
the
husband
sharp
like
she
was
a
soldier
under
order
down
an
give
the
bridle
to
the
groom
an
comes
and
kneels
down
the
woman
took
him
up
right
by
me
an
says
the
matter
what
can
i
do
an
finds
out
in
two
minutes
an
sends
to
the
farm
for
some
brandy
an
all
this
basketful
of
stuff
jerking
her
head
towards
the
treasure
at
her
side
an
gives
with
another
jerk
towards
her
mate
money
enough
to
us
along
till
i
fair
on
my
feet
that
quick
it
was
that
quick
passing
her
hand
over
her
forehead
as
if
it
was
for
the
basket
with
a
nervous
giggle
i
would
believe
but
what
it
was
a
dream
i
she
was
a
very
kind
young
lady
said
mount
dunstan
and
you
were
in
he
gave
a
few
coppers
to
the
children
and
strode
on
his
way
the
glow
was
hot
in
his
heart
and
he
held
his
head
high
she
has
gone
by
he
said
she
has
gone
he
knew
he
should
find
her
at
west
ways
farm
and
he
did
so
slim
and
straight
as
a
young
birch
tree
and
elate
with
her
ride
in
the
morning
air
she
stood
silhouetted
in
her
black
habit
against
the
ancient
whitewashed
brick
porch
as
she
talked
to
bolter
i
have
been
drinking
a
glass
of
milk
and
asking
questions
about
hops
she
said
giving
him
her
hand
bare
of
glove
until
this
year
i
have
never
seen
a
hop
garden
or
a
hop
after
the
exchange
of
a
few
words
bolter
respectfully
melted
away
and
left
them
together
it
was
such
a
wonderful
day
that
i
wanted
to
be
out
under
the
sky
for
a
long
time
to
ride
a
long
way
she
explained
i
have
been
looking
at
hop
gardens
as
i
rode
i
have
watched
them
all
the
summer
from
the
time
when
there
was
only
a
little
thing
with
two
or
three
pale
green
leaves
looking
imploringly
all
the
way
up
to
the
top
of
each
immensely
tall
hop
pole
from
its
place
in
the
earth
at
the
bottom
of
it
as
if
it
was
saying
over
and
over
again
under
its
breath
i
get
up
there
can
i
get
up
can
i
do
it
in
time
can
i
do
it
in
time
yes
that
was
what
they
were
saying
the
little
bold
things
i
have
watched
them
ever
since
putting
out
tendrils
and
taking
hold
of
the
poles
and
pulling
and
climbing
like
little
acrobats
and
curling
round
and
unfolding
leaves
and
more
leaves
until
at
last
they
threw
them
out
as
if
they
were
beginning
to
boast
that
they
could
climb
up
into
the
blue
of
the
sky
if
the
summer
were
long
enough
and
now
look
at
them
her
hand
waved
towards
the
great
gardens
forests
of
them
cool
green
pathways
and
avenues
with
leaf
canopies
over
you
have
seen
it
all
he
said
you
do
see
things
do
you
a
few
hundred
yards
down
the
road
i
passed
something
you
had
seen
i
knew
it
was
you
who
had
seen
it
though
the
poor
wretches
had
not
heard
your
she
hesitated
a
moment
then
stooped
down
and
took
up
in
her
hand
a
bit
of
pebbled
earth
from
the
pathway
there
was
storm
in
the
blue
of
her
eyes
as
she
held
it
out
for
him
to
look
at
as
it
lay
on
the
bare
of
her
palm
see
she
said
see
it
is
like
that
what
we
give
it
is
like
and
she
tossed
the
earth
away
it
does
not
seem
like
that
to
those
no
thank
god
it
does
not
but
to
one
self
it
is
the
mere
luxury
of
and
the
realisation
of
it
sometimes
tempts
one
to
be
even
a
trifle
morbid
do
you
see
a
sudden
thrill
in
her
voice
startled
him
they
are
on
the
roadside
everywhere
all
over
the
yes
all
over
the
once
when
i
was
a
child
of
ten
i
read
a
magazine
article
about
the
suffering
millions
and
the
monstrously
rich
who
were
obviously
to
blame
for
every
starved
sob
and
cry
it
almost
drove
me
out
of
my
childish
senses
i
went
to
my
father
and
threw
myself
into
his
arms
in
a
violent
fit
of
crying
i
clung
to
him
and
sobbed
out
us
give
it
all
away
let
us
give
it
all
away
and
be
like
other
people
what
did
he
say
he
said
we
could
never
be
quite
like
other
people
we
had
a
certain
load
to
carry
along
the
highway
it
was
the
thing
the
whole
world
wanted
and
which
we
ourselves
wanted
as
much
as
the
rest
and
we
could
not
sanely
throw
it
away
it
was
my
first
lesson
in
political
economy
and
i
abhorred
it
i
was
a
passionate
child
and
beat
furiously
against
the
stone
walls
enclosing
present
suffering
it
was
horrible
to
know
that
they
could
not
be
torn
down
i
cried
out
i
see
anyone
who
is
miserable
by
the
roadside
i
shall
stop
and
give
him
everything
he
wants
everything
i
was
ten
years
old
and
thought
it
could
be
but
you
stop
by
the
roadside
even
yes
that
one
can
you
are
two
strong
creatures
and
you
draw
each
other
penzance
had
said
perhaps
you
drew
each
other
across
seas
who
knows
coming
to
west
ways
on
a
chance
errand
he
had
as
it
were
found
her
awaiting
him
on
the
threshold
on
her
part
she
had
certainly
not
anticipated
seeing
him
there
but
when
one
rides
far
afield
in
the
sun
there
are
roads
towards
which
one
turns
as
if
answering
a
summoning
call
and
as
her
horse
had
obeyed
a
certain
touch
of
the
rein
at
a
certain
point
her
cheek
had
felt
momentarily
hot
until
later
when
the
picking
had
fairly
begun
the
kilns
would
not
be
at
work
but
there
was
some
interest
even
now
in
going
over
the
ground
for
the
first
time
i
have
never
been
inside
an
oast
house
she
said
bolter
is
going
to
show
me
his
and
explain
may
i
come
with
you
he
asked
there
was
a
change
in
him
something
had
lighted
in
his
eyes
since
the
day
before
when
he
had
told
her
his
story
of
red
godwyn
she
wondered
what
it
was
they
went
together
over
the
place
escorted
by
bolter
they
looked
into
the
great
circular
ovens
on
whose
floors
the
hops
would
be
laid
for
drying
they
mounted
steps
to
the
upper
room
where
when
dried
the
same
hops
would
lie
in
soft
light
piles
until
pushed
with
wooden
shovels
into
the
long
pokes
to
be
pressed
and
packed
into
a
solid
marketable
mass
bolter
was
allowed
to
explain
the
technicalities
but
it
was
plain
that
mount
dunstan
was
familiar
with
all
of
them
and
it
was
he
who
with
a
sentence
here
and
there
gave
her
the
colour
of
things
when
it
is
being
done
there
is
nearly
always
outside
a
touch
of
the
sharp
sweetness
of
early
autumn
he
said
the
sun
slanting
through
the
little
window
falls
on
the
pale
yellow
heaps
and
there
is
a
pungent
scent
of
hops
in
the
air
which
is
rather
i
am
coming
later
to
see
the
entire
process
she
answered
it
was
a
mere
matter
of
seeing
common
things
together
and
exchanging
common
speech
concerning
them
but
each
was
so
strongly
conscious
of
the
other
that
no
sentence
could
seem
wholly
impersonal
there
are
times
when
the
whole
world
is
personal
to
a
mood
whose
intensity
seems
a
reason
for
all
things
words
are
of
small
moment
when
the
mere
sound
of
a
voice
makes
an
unreasonable
joy
there
was
that
touch
of
sharp
autumn
sweetness
in
the
air
yesterday
morning
she
said
and
the
chaplets
of
briony
berries
that
look
as
if
they
had
been
thrown
over
the
hedges
are
beginning
to
change
to
scarlet
here
and
there
the
wild
are
reddening
and
so
are
the
clusters
of
berries
on
the
thorn
trees
and
there
are
millions
of
them
mount
dunstan
said
and
in
a
few
time
they
will
look
like
bunches
of
crimson
coral
when
the
sun
shines
on
them
they
will
be
wonderful
to
what
was
there
in
such
speeches
as
these
to
draw
any
two
nearer
and
nearer
to
each
other
as
they
walked
side
by
side
to
fill
the
morning
air
with
an
intensity
of
life
to
seem
to
cause
the
world
to
drop
away
and
become
as
nothing
as
they
had
been
isolated
during
their
waltz
in
the
crowded
ballroom
at
dunholm
castle
so
they
were
isolated
now
when
they
stood
in
the
narrow
green
groves
of
the
hop
garden
talking
simply
of
the
placing
of
the
bins
and
the
stripping
and
measuring
of
the
vines
there
might
have
been
no
human
thing
within
a
hundred
miles
within
a
thousand
for
the
first
time
his
height
and
strength
conveyed
to
her
an
impression
of
physical
beauty
his
walk
and
bearing
gave
her
pleasure
when
he
turned
his
eyes
upon
her
suddenly
she
was
conscious
that
she
liked
their
colour
their
shape
the
power
of
the
look
in
them
on
his
part
he
for
the
twentieth
time
found
himself
newly
moved
by
the
dower
nature
had
bestowed
on
her
had
the
world
ever
held
before
a
woman
creature
so
much
to
be
longed
for
abnormal
wealth
new
york
and
fifth
avenue
notwithstanding
a
man
could
only
think
of
folding
arms
round
her
and
whispering
in
her
lovely
ear
follies
oaths
prayers
gratitude
and
yet
as
they
went
about
together
there
was
growing
in
betty
vanderpoel
mind
a
certain
realisation
it
grew
in
spite
of
the
recognition
of
the
change
in
him
the
new
thing
lighted
in
his
eyes
whatsoever
he
felt
if
he
felt
anything
he
would
never
allow
himself
speech
how
could
he
in
his
place
she
could
not
speak
herself
because
he
was
the
strong
thing
which
drew
her
thoughts
he
would
not
come
to
any
woman
only
to
cast
at
her
feet
a
burden
which
in
the
nature
of
things
she
must
take
up
and
suddenly
she
comprehended
that
the
mere
obstinate
briton
in
him
even
apart
from
greater
things
had
an
immense
attraction
for
her
as
she
liked
now
the
colour
of
his
eyes
and
saw
beauty
in
his
rugged
features
so
she
liked
his
british
stubbornness
and
the
pride
which
would
not
be
beaten
it
is
the
unconquerable
thing
which
leads
them
in
their
battles
and
makes
them
bear
any
horror
rather
than
give
in
they
have
taken
half
the
world
with
it
they
are
like
bulldogs
and
lions
she
thought
and
and
i
am
glorying
in
do
you
know
said
mount
dunstan
that
sometimes
you
suddenly
fling
out
the
most
magnificent
flag
of
colour
as
if
some
splendid
flame
of
thought
had
sent
up
a
blaze
i
hope
it
is
not
a
habit
she
answered
when
one
has
a
splendid
flare
of
thought
one
should
be
modest
about
what
was
there
worth
recording
in
the
whole
hour
they
spent
together
outwardly
there
had
only
been
a
chance
meeting
and
a
mere
passing
by
but
each
left
something
with
the
other
and
each
learned
something
and
the
record
made
was
deep
at
last
she
was
on
her
horse
again
on
the
road
outside
the
white
gate
this
morning
has
been
so
much
to
the
good
he
said
i
had
thought
that
perhaps
we
might
scarcely
meet
again
this
year
i
shall
become
absorbed
in
hops
and
you
will
no
doubt
go
away
you
will
make
visits
or
go
to
the
riviera
or
to
new
york
for
the
winter
i
do
not
know
yet
but
at
least
i
shall
stay
to
watch
the
thorn
trees
load
themselves
with
to
herself
she
was
saying
he
means
to
keep
away
i
shall
not
see
as
she
rode
off
mount
dunstan
stood
for
a
few
moments
not
moving
from
his
place
at
a
short
distance
from
the
farmhouse
gate
a
side
lane
opened
upon
the
highway
and
as
she
cantered
in
its
direction
a
horseman
turned
in
from
it
a
man
who
was
young
and
well
dressed
and
who
sat
well
a
spirited
animal
he
came
out
upon
the
road
almost
face
to
face
with
miss
vanderpoel
and
from
where
he
stood
mount
dunstan
could
see
his
delighted
smile
as
he
lifted
his
hat
in
salute
it
was
lord
westholt
and
what
more
natural
than
that
after
an
exchange
of
greetings
the
two
should
ride
together
on
their
way
for
nearly
three
miles
their
homeward
road
would
be
the
same
but
in
a
breath
space
mount
dunstan
realised
a
certain
truth
a
simple
elemental
thing
all
the
exaltation
of
the
morning
swooped
and
fell
as
a
bird
seems
to
swoop
and
fall
through
space
it
was
all
over
and
done
with
and
he
understood
it
his
normal
awakening
in
the
morning
the
physical
and
mental
elation
of
the
first
clear
hours
the
spring
of
his
foot
as
he
had
trod
the
road
had
all
had
but
one
meaning
in
some
occult
way
the
hypnotic
talk
of
the
night
before
had
formed
itself
into
a
reality
fantastic
and
unreasoning
as
it
had
been
some
insistent
inner
consciousness
had
seized
upon
and
believed
it
in
spite
of
him
and
had
set
all
his
waking
being
in
tune
to
it
that
was
the
explanation
of
his
undue
spirits
and
hope
if
penzance
had
spoken
a
truth
he
would
have
had
a
natural
sane
right
to
feel
all
this
and
more
but
the
truth
was
that
he
in
his
guise
was
one
of
those
who
are
on
the
roadside
everywhere
all
over
the
poetically
figurative
as
the
thing
sounded
it
was
prosaic
fact
so
still
hearing
the
distant
sounds
of
the
hoofs
beating
in
cheerful
diminuendo
on
the
roadway
he
turned
about
and
went
back
to
talk
to
bolter
chapter
xxxvii
closed
corridors
to
spend
one
days
perforce
in
an
enormous
house
alone
is
a
thing
likely
to
play
unholy
tricks
with
a
man
mind
and
lead
it
to
gloomy
workings
to
know
the
existence
of
a
hundred
or
so
of
closed
doors
shut
on
the
darkness
of
unoccupied
rooms
to
be
conscious
of
flights
of
unmounted
stairs
of
stretches
of
untrodden
corridors
of
unending
walls
from
which
the
pictured
eyes
of
long
dead
men
and
women
stare
as
if
seeing
things
which
human
eyes
behold
not
is
an
eerie
and
unwholesome
thing
mount
dunstan
slept
in
a
large
bed
in
a
chamber
in
which
he
might
have
died
or
been
murdered
a
score
of
times
without
being
able
to
communicate
with
the
remote
servants
quarters
below
stairs
where
lay
the
one
man
and
one
woman
who
attended
him
when
he
came
late
to
his
room
and
prepared
for
sleep
by
the
light
of
two
flickering
candles
the
silence
of
the
dead
in
tombs
was
about
him
but
it
was
only
a
more
profound
and
insistent
thing
than
the
silence
of
the
day
because
it
was
the
silence
of
the
night
which
is
a
presence
he
used
to
tell
himself
with
secret
smiles
at
the
fact
that
at
certain
times
the
fantasy
was
half
believable
that
there
were
things
which
walked
about
softly
at
night
things
which
did
not
want
to
be
dead
he
himself
had
picked
them
out
from
among
the
pictures
in
the
gallery
pretty
light
petulant
women
eager
men
his
theory
was
that
they
hated
their
stone
coffins
and
fought
their
way
back
through
the
grey
mists
to
try
to
talk
and
make
love
and
to
be
seen
of
warm
things
which
were
alive
but
it
was
not
to
be
done
because
they
had
no
bodies
and
no
voices
and
when
they
beat
upon
closed
doors
they
would
not
open
still
they
came
back
came
back
and
sometimes
there
was
a
rustle
and
a
sweep
through
the
air
in
a
passage
or
a
creak
or
a
sense
of
waiting
which
was
almost
a
sound
perhaps
some
of
them
have
gone
when
they
have
been
as
i
am
he
had
said
one
black
night
when
he
had
sat
in
his
room
staring
at
the
floor
if
a
man
was
dragged
out
when
he
had
not
lived
a
day
he
would
come
back
i
should
come
back
if
god
a
man
could
not
be
dragged
away
like
this
and
to
sit
alone
and
think
of
it
was
an
awful
and
a
lonely
thing
a
lonely
thing
but
loneliness
was
nothing
new
only
that
in
these
months
his
had
strangely
intensified
itself
this
though
he
was
not
aware
of
it
was
because
the
soul
and
body
which
were
the
completing
parts
of
him
were
within
reach
and
without
it
when
he
went
down
to
breakfast
he
sat
singly
at
his
table
round
which
twenty
people
might
have
laughed
and
talked
between
the
and
the
library
he
spent
his
days
when
he
was
not
out
of
doors
since
he
could
not
afford
servants
the
many
other
rooms
must
be
kept
closed
it
was
a
ghastly
and
melancholy
thing
to
make
as
he
must
sometimes
a
sort
of
precautionary
visit
to
the
state
apartments
he
was
the
last
mount
dunstan
and
he
would
never
see
them
opened
again
for
use
but
so
long
as
he
lived
under
the
roof
he
might
by
prevision
check
in
a
measure
the
too
rapid
encroachments
of
decay
to
have
a
leak
stopped
here
a
nail
driven
or
a
support
put
there
seemed
decent
things
to
do
whom
am
i
doing
it
for
he
said
to
penzance
i
am
doing
it
for
myself
because
i
can
not
help
it
the
place
seems
to
me
like
some
gorgeous
old
warrior
come
to
the
end
of
his
days
it
has
stood
the
war
of
things
for
century
after
century
the
war
of
things
it
is
going
now
i
am
all
that
is
left
to
it
it
is
all
i
have
so
i
patch
it
up
when
i
can
afford
it
with
a
crutch
or
a
splint
and
a
late
in
the
afternoon
of
the
day
on
which
miss
vanderpoel
rode
away
from
west
ways
with
lord
westholt
a
stealthy
and
darkly
purple
cloud
rose
lifting
its
ominous
bulk
against
a
chrysoprase
and
pink
horizon
it
was
the
kind
of
cloud
which
speaks
of
but
one
thing
to
those
who
watch
clouds
or
even
casually
consider
them
so
lady
anstruthers
felt
some
surprise
when
she
saw
sir
nigel
mount
his
horse
before
the
stone
steps
and
ride
away
as
it
were
into
the
very
heart
of
the
coming
storm
nigel
will
be
caught
in
the
rain
she
said
to
her
sister
i
wonder
why
he
goes
out
now
it
would
be
better
to
wait
until
but
sir
nigel
did
not
think
so
he
had
calculated
matters
with
some
nicety
he
was
not
exactly
on
such
terms
with
mount
dunstan
as
would
make
a
casual
call
seem
an
entirely
natural
thing
and
he
wished
to
drop
in
upon
him
for
a
casual
call
and
in
an
unpremeditated
manner
he
meant
to
reach
the
mount
about
the
time
the
storm
broke
under
which
circumstance
nothing
could
bear
more
lightly
an
air
of
being
unpremeditated
than
to
take
refuge
in
a
chance
passing
mount
dunstan
was
in
the
library
he
had
sat
smoking
his
pipe
while
he
watched
the
purple
cloud
roll
up
and
spread
itself
blotting
out
the
chrysoprase
and
pink
and
blue
and
when
the
branches
of
the
trees
began
to
toss
about
he
had
looked
on
with
pleasure
as
the
rush
of
big
rain
drops
came
down
and
pelted
things
it
was
a
fine
storm
and
there
were
some
imposing
claps
of
thunder
and
jagged
flashes
of
lightning
as
one
splendid
rattle
shook
the
air
he
was
surprised
to
hear
a
summons
at
the
great
hall
door
who
on
earth
could
be
turning
up
at
this
time
his
man
reeve
announced
the
arrival
a
few
moments
later
and
it
was
sir
nigel
anstruthers
he
had
he
explained
been
riding
through
the
village
when
the
deluge
descended
and
it
had
occurred
to
him
to
turn
in
at
the
park
gates
and
ask
a
temporary
shelter
mount
dunstan
received
him
with
sufficient
courtesy
his
appearance
was
not
a
thing
to
rejoice
over
but
it
could
be
endured
whisky
and
soda
and
a
smoke
would
serve
to
pass
the
hour
if
the
storm
lasted
so
long
conversation
was
not
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
under
the
circumstances
but
sir
nigel
led
the
way
steadily
after
he
had
taken
his
seat
and
accepted
the
hospitalities
offered
what
a
place
it
was
this
he
had
been
struck
for
the
hundredth
time
with
the
impressiveness
of
the
mass
of
it
the
sweep
of
the
park
and
the
splendid
grouping
of
the
timber
as
he
had
ridden
up
the
avenue
there
was
no
other
place
like
it
in
the
county
was
there
another
like
it
in

not
in
its
case

hope
mount
dunstan
said
there
were
a
few
seconds
of
silence
the
rain
poured
down
in
splashing
sheets
and
was
swept
in
rattling
gusts
against
the
window
panes
what
the
place
needs
is
an
heiress
anstruthers
observed
in
the
tone
of
a
practical
man
i
believe
i
have
heard
that
your
views
of
things
are
such
that
she
should
preferably
not
be
an
mount
dunstan
did
not
smile
though
he
slightly
showed
his
teeth
when
i
am
driven
to
the
wall
he
answered
i
may
not
be
fastidious
as
to
nigel
anstruthers
manner
was
not
a
bad
one
he
chose
that
tone
of
casual
openness
which
while
it
does
not
wholly
commit
itself
may
be
regarded
as
suggestive
of
the
amiable
half
confidence
of
speeches
made
as
man
to
my
own
opportunity
of
studying
the
genus
american
heiress
within
my
own
gates
is
a
one
i
find
that
it
knows
what
it
wants
and
that
its
intention
is
to
get
a
short
laugh
broke
from
him
as
he
flicked
the
ash
from
his
cigar
on
to
the
small
bronze
receptacle
at
his
elbow
it
is
not
many
years
since
it
would
have
been
difficult
for
a
girl
to
be
frank
enough
to
say
i
marry
i
shall
ask
something
in
exchange
for
what
i
have
to
give
there
are
not
many
who
have
as
much
to
give
said
mount
dunstan
coolly
true
with
a
slight
shrug
you
are
thinking
that
men
are
glad
enough
to
take
a
girl
like
that
even
one
who
has
not
a
shape
like
diana
and
eyes
like
the
sea
yes
by
george
softly
and
narrowing
his
lids
she
is
a
handsome
mount
dunstan
did
not
attempt
to
refute
the
statement
and
anstruthers
laughed
low
again
it
is
an
asset
she
knows
the
value
of
quite
clearly
that
is
the
interesting
part
of
it
she
has
inherited
the
commercial
mind
she
does
not
object
to
admitting
it
she
educated
herself
in
delightful
cold
blood
that
she
might
be
prepared
for
the
largest
prize
appearing
upon
the
horizon
she
held
things
in
view
when
she
was
a
child
at
school
and
obviously
attacked
her
french
german
and
italian
conjugations
with
a
eye
on
the
mount
dunstan
leaning
back
carelessly
in
his
chair
laughed
as
it
seemed
with
him
internally
he
was
saying
that
the
man
was
a
liar
who
might
always
be
trusted
to
lie
but
he
knew
with
shamed
fury
that
the
lies
were
doing
something
to
his
soul
rolling
dark
vapours
over
it
stinging
him
dragging
away
props
and
making
him
feel
they
had
been
foolish
things
to
lean
on
this
can
always
be
done
with
a
man
in
love
who
has
slight
foundation
for
hope
for
some
mysterious
and
occult
reason
civilisation
has
elected
to
treat
the
strange
and
great
passion
as
if
it
were
an
unholy
and
indecent
thing
whose
dominion
over
him
proper
social
training
prevents
any
man
from
admitting
openly
in
passing
through
its
cruelest
phases
he
must
bear
himself
as
if
he
were
immune
and
this
being
the
custom
he
may
be
called
upon
to
endure
much
without
the
relief
of
striking
out
with
manly
blows
an
enemy
guessing
his
case
and
possessing
the
infernal
gift
whose
joy
is
to
dishearten
and
do
hurt
with
courteous
despitefulness
may
plant
a
poisoned
arrow
here
and
there
with
neatness
and
fine
touch
while
his
bound
victim
can
with
decency
neither
start
nor
utter
brave
howls
nor
guard
himself
but
must
sit
still
and
listen
hospitably
supplying
smoke
and
drink
and
being
careful
not
to
make
an
ass
of
himself
therefore
mount
dunstan
pushed
the
cigars
nearer
to
his
visitor
and
waved
his
hand
hospitably
towards
the
whisky
and
soda
there
was
no
reason
in
fact
why
anstruthers
or
any
one
indeed
but
penzance
should
suspect
that
he
had
become
somewhat
mad
in
secret
the
man
talk
was
marked
merely
by
the
lightly
disparaging
malice
which
was
rarely
to
be
missed
from
any
speech
of
his
which
touched
on
others
yet
it
might
have
been
a
thing
arranged
beforehand
to
suggest
adroitly
either
lies
or
truth
which
would
make
a
man
see
every
sickeningly
good
reason
for
feeling
that
in
this
contest
he
did
not
count
for
a
man
at
all
it
has
all
been
pretty
obvious
said
sir
nigel
there
is
a
sort
of
cynicism
in
the
openness
of
the
siege
my
impression
is
that
almost
every
youngster
who
has
met
her
has
taken
a
shot
tommy
alanby
scrambling
up
from
his
knees
in
one
of
the
was
a
satisfying
sight
his
for
jane
lithcom
was
temporarily
in
the
rain
swirled
in
a
torrent
against
the
window
and
casually
glancing
outside
at
the
tossing
gardens
he
went
on
she
is
enjoying
herself
why
not
she
has
the
spirit
of
the
huntress
i
do
think
she
talks
nonsense
about
friendship
to
the
captives
of
her
bow
and
spear
she
knows
she
can
always
get
what
she
wants
a
girl
like
that
must
have
an
arrogance
of
mind
and
she
is
not
a
young
saint
she
is
one
of
the
women
born
with
the
look
in
her
eyes
i
own
i
should
not
like
to
be
in
the
place
of
any
primeval
poor
brute
who
really
went
mad
over
her
and
counted
her
millions
as
so
much
mount
dunstan
answered
with
a
shrug
of
his
big
shoulders
apparently
he
would
seem
as
remote
from
the
reason
of
as
the
men
who
lived
on
the
land
when
hengist
and
horsa
came
or
when
caesar
landed
at
he
would
seem
as
remote
to
her
with
a
shrug
also
i
should
not
like
to
contend
that
his
point
of
view
would
not
interest
her
or
that
she
would
particularly
discourage
him
her
eyes
would
call
him
without
malice
or
intention
no
doubt
but
your
early
briton
ceorl
or
earl
would
be
as
well
understood
by
her
your
new
york
beauty
who
has
lived
in
the
market
place
knows
principally
the
prices
of
he
was
not
ill
pleased
with
himself
he
was
putting
it
well
and
getting
rather
even
with
her
if
this
fellow
with
his
shut
mouth
had
a
sore
spot
hidden
anywhere
he
was
giving
him
to
and
he
would
find
himself
thinking
while
whatsoever
he
thought
he
would
be
obliged
to
continue
to
keep
his
ugly
mouth
shut
the
great
idea
was
to
say
things
without
saying
them
to
set
your
hearer
mind
to
saying
them
for
you
what
strikes
one
most
is
a
sort
of
commercial
brilliance
in
her
taking
up
his
thread
again
after
a
smilingly
reflective
pause
it
quite
exhilarates
one
by
its
novelty
there
spice
in
it
we
english
have
not
a
when
we
are
dealing
with
americans
and
yet
france
calls
us
a
nation
of
shopkeepers
my
impression
is
that
their
women
take
little
inventories
of
every
house
they
enter
of
every
man
they
meet
i
heard
her
once
speaking
to
my
wife
about
this
place
as
if
she
had
lived
in
it
she
spoke
of
the
closed
windows
and
the
state
of
the
gardens
of
broken
fountains
and
fallen
arches
she
evidently
deplored
the
deterioration
of
things
which
represented
capital
she
has
inventoried
dunholm
no
doubt
that
will
give
westholt
a
chance
but
she
will
do
nothing
until
after
her
next
year
season
in
london
that
i
swear
i
look
forward
to
next
year
it
will
be
worth
watching
she
has
been
training
my
wife
a
sister
who
has
married
an
englishman
and
has
at
least
spent
some
years
of
her
life
in
england
has
a
certain
established
air
when
she
is
presented
one
knows
she
will
be
a
sensation
after
that
he
hesitated
a
moment
smiling
not
too
pleasantly
after
that
said
mount
dunstan
the
exactly
the
deluge
which
usually
sweeps
girls
off
their
feet
but
it
will
not
sweep
her
off
hers
she
will
stand
quite
firm
in
the
flood
and
lose
sight
of
nothing
of
importance
which
floats
mount
dunstan
took
him
up
he
was
sick
of
hearing
the
fellow
voice
there
will
be
a
good
many
things
he
said
there
will
be
great
personages
and
small
ones
pomps
and
vanities
glittering
things
and
heavy
when
she
sees
what
she
wants
said
anstruthers
she
will
hold
out
her
hand
knowing
it
will
come
to
her
the
things
which
drown
will
not
disturb
her
i
once
made
the
blunder
of
suggesting
that
she
might
need
protection
against
the
importunate
as
if
she
had
been
an
english
girl
it
was
an
idiotic
thing
to
because
mount
dunstan
for
the
moment
had
lost
his
head
anstruthers
had
maddeningly
paused
she
answered
that
if
it
became
necessary
she
might
perhaps
be
able
to
protect
herself
she
was
as
cool
and
frank
as
a
boy
no
air
pince
about
it
merely
consciousness
of
being
able
to
put
things
in
their
right
places
made
a
mere
male
relative
feel
like
a
when
are
things
in
their
right
places
to
his
credit
be
it
spoken
mount
dunstan
managed
to
say
it
as
if
in
the
mere
putting
together
of
idle
words
what
man
likes
to
be
reminded
of
his
right
place
no
man
wants
to
be
put
in
his
right
place
there
is
always
another
place
which
seems
more
desirable
she
knows
if
we
others
do
not
i
suppose
my
right
place
is
at
stornham
conducting
myself
as
the
of
a
fair
american
should
i
suppose
yours
is
here
shut
up
among
your
closed
corridors
and
locked
doors
there
must
be
a
lot
of
them
in
a
house
like
this
you
sometimes
feel
it
too
large
for
you
always
answered
mount
dunstan
the
fact
that
he
added
nothing
else
and
met
a
rapid
side
glance
with
unmoving
eyes
gazing
out
from
under
rugged
brows
perhaps
irritated
anstruthers
he
had
been
rather
enjoying
himself
but
he
had
not
enjoyed
himself
enough
there
was
no
denying
that
his
plaything
had
not
openly
flinched
plainly
he
was
not
good
at
flinching
anstruthers
wondered
how
far
a
man
might
go
he
tried
again
she
likes
the
place
though
she
has
a
natural
disdain
for
its
condition
that
is
practical
american
things
which
are
going
to
pieces
because
money
is
not
spent
upon
them
mere
money
of
which
all
the
people
who
count
for
anything
have
so
much
are
inevitably
rather
disdained
they
are
of
it
but
she
likes
the
as
he
watched
mount
dunstan
he
felt
sure
he
had
got
it
at
last
the
right
thing
if
you
were
a
duke
with
fifty
thousand
a
year
with
a
distinctly
nasty
amicably
humorous
faint
laugh
she
would
by
the
lord
i
believe
she
would
take
it
over
and
you
with
mount
dunstan
got
up
in
his
rough
walking
tweeds
he
looked
and
heavy
and
perilous
for
two
seconds
nigel
anstruthers
would
not
have
been
surprised
if
he
had
without
warning
slapped
his
face
or
knocked
him
over
or
whirled
him
out
of
his
chair
and
kicked
him
he
would
not
have
liked
it
but
for
two
seconds
it
would
have
been
no
surprise
in
fact
he
instinctively
braced
his
not
too
firm
muscles
but
nothing
of
the
sort
occurred
during
the
two
seconds
perhaps
three
mount
dunstan
stood
still
and
looked
down
at
him
the
brief
space
at
an
end
he
walked
over
to
the
hearth
and
stood
with
his
back
to
the
big
fireplace
you
do
like
her
he
said
and
his
manner
was
that
of
a
man
dealing
with
a
matter
of
fact
why
do
you
talk
about
her
he
had
got
away
again
quite
away
an
ugly
flush
shot
over
anstruthers
face
there
was
one
more
thing
to
say
whether
it
was
idiotic
to
say
it
or
not
things
can
always
be
denied
afterwards
should
denial
appear
necessary
and
for
the
moment
his
special
devil
possessed
him
i
do
not
like
her
and
his
mouth
twisted
do
i
not
i
am
not
an
old
woman
i
am
a
man
like
others
i
chance
to
like
her
too
there
was
a
short
silence
mount
dunstan
broke
it
then
he
remarked
you
had
better
emigrate
to
some
country
with
a
climate
which
suits
you
i
should
say
that
england
for
the
present
does
i
shall
stay
where
i
am
answered
anstruthers
with
a
slight
hoarseness
of
voice
which
made
it
necessary
for
him
to
clear
his
throat
i
shall
stay
where
she
is
i
will
have
that
satisfaction
at
least
she
does
not
mind
i
am
only
a
racketty
and
she
can
take
care
of
herself
as
i
told
you
she
has
the
spirit
of
the
look
here
said
mount
dunstan
quite
without
haste
and
with
an
iron
civility
i
am
going
to
take
the
liberty
of
suggesting
something
if
this
thing
is
true
it
would
be
as
well
not
to
talk
about
as
well
for
me
or
for
her
and
there
was
a
serene
significance
in
the
query
mount
dunstan
thought
a
few
seconds
i
confess
he
said
slowly
and
he
planted
his
fine
blow
between
the
eyes
well
and
with
directness
i
confess
that
it
would
not
have
occurred
to
me
to
ask
you
to
do
anything
or
refrain
from
doing
it
for
her
thank
you
perhaps
you
are
right
one
learns
that
one
must
protect
one
self
i
shall
not
talk
neither
will
you
i
know
that
i
was
a
fool
to
let
it
out
the
storm
is
over
i
must
ride
he
rose
from
his
seat
and
stood
smiling
it
would
smash
up
things
nicely
if
the
new
beauty
appearance
in
the
great
world
were
preceded
by
chatter
of
the
unseemly
affection
of
some
adorer
of
ill
repute
unfairly
enough
it
is
always
the
woman
who
is
unless
said
mount
dunstan
civilly
there
should
arise
the
poor
primeval
brute
in
his
neolithic
wrath
to
seize
on
the
man
to
blame
and
break
every
bone
and
sinew
in
his
damned
the
newspapers
would
enjoy
that
more
than
she
would
answered
sir
nigel
she
does
not
like
the
newspapers
they
are
too
ready
to
disparage
the
and
cackle
about
members
of
his
the
unhidden
hatred
which
still
professed
to
hide
itself
in
the
depths
of
their
pupils
as
they
regarded
each
other
had
its
birth
in
a
passion
as
elemental
as
the
quakings
of
the
earth
or
the
rage
of
two
lions
in
a
desert
lashing
their
flanks
in
the
blazing
sun
it
was
well
that
at
this
moment
they
should
part
ways
sir
nigel
horse
being
brought
he
went
on
the
way
which
was
his
it
was
a
mistake
to
say
what
i
did
he
said
before
going
i
ought
to
have
held
my
tongue
but
i
am
under
the
same
roof
with
her
at
any
rate
that
is
a
privilege
no
other
man
shares
with
he
rode
off
smartly
his
horse
hoofs
splashing
in
the
rain
pools
left
in
the
avenue
after
the
storm
he
was
not
so
sure
after
all
that
he
had
made
a
mistake
and
for
the
moment
he
was
not
in
the
mood
to
care
whether
he
had
made
one
or
not
his
agreeable
smile
showed
itself
as
he
thought
of
the
obstinate
proud
brute
he
had
left
behind
sitting
alone
among
his
shut
doors
and
closed
corridors
they
had
not
shaken
hands
either
at
meeting
or
parting
queer
thing
it
was
the
kind
of
enmity
a
man
could
feel
for
another
when
he
was
upset
by
a
woman
it
was
amusing
enough
that
it
should
be
she
who
was
upsetting
him
after
all
these
years
impudent
little
betty
with
the
ferocious
manner
chapter
xxxviii
at
on
a
evening
in
new
york
the
atmosphere
surrounding
a
certain
corner
table
at
shandy
cheap
restaurant
in
fourteenth
street
was
stirred
by
a
sense
of
excitement
the
corner
table
in
question
was
the
favourite
meeting
place
of
a
group
of
young
men
of
the
selden
type
who
usually
took
possession
of
it
at
dinner
time
having
decided
that
shandy
supplied
more
decent
food
for
fifty
cents
or
even
for
than
was
to
be
found
at
other
places
of
its
order

was
about
all
right
they
said
to
each
other
and
patronised
it
accordingly
three
or
four
of
them
generally
dining
together
with
a
friendly
and
adroit
manipulation
of
portions
and
half
portions
which
enabled
them
to
add
variety
to
their
bill
of
fare
the
street
outside
was
lighted
the
tide
of
was
less
full
and
more
leisurely
in
its
movements
than
it
was
during
the
seething
working
hours
of
daylight
but
the
electric
cars
swung
past
each
other
with
whiz
and
clang
of
bell
almost
unceasingly
their
sound
being
swelled
at
short
intervals
by
the
roar
and
rumbling
rattle
of
the
trains
dashing
by
on
the
elevated
railroad
this
however
to
the
frequenters
of
shandy
was
the
usual
accompaniment
of
new
york
life
and
was
regarded
as
a
rather
cheerful
sort
of
thing
this
evening
the
four
claimants
of
the
favourite
corner
table
had
met
together
earlier
than
usual
jem
belter
who
hammered
a
typewriter
at
schwab
brewery
tom
wetherbee
who
was
in
a
downtown
office
bert
johnson
who
was
out
for
the
delkoff
and
nick
baumgarten
who
having
for
some
time
beaten
certain
streets
as
assistant
salesman
for
the
same
illustrious
machine
had
been
recently
elevated
to
a
territory
of
his
own
and
was
therefore
in
high
spirits
say
he
said
let
give
him
a
fine
dinner
we
can
make
it
between
us
beefsteak
and
mushrooms
and
potatoes
hashed
brown
he
likes
them
good
old
i
shall
be
right
glad
to
see
him
hope
foreign
travel
has
not
given
him
the
swell
do
believe
it
hurt
him
a
bit
his
letter
did
sound
like
it
little
georgie
ai
a
fool
said
jem
belter
tom
wetherbee
was
looking
over
the
letter
referred
to
it
had
been
written
to
the
four
conjointly
towards
the
termination
of
visit
to
penzance
the
young
man
was
not
an
ardent
or
fluent
correspondent
but
tom
wetherbee
was
chuckling
as
he
read
the
epistle
say
boys
he
said
this
big
thing
he
keeping
back
to
tell
us
when
he
sees
us
is
all
right
but
what
takes
me
is
old
george
paying
a
visit
to
a
parson
he
ai
no
young
men
christian
bert
johnson
leaned
forward
and
looked
at
the
address
on
the
letter
paper
mount
dunstan
vicarage
he
read
aloud
that
looks
pretty
swell
does
it
with
a
laugh
say
fellows
you
know
jepson
at
the
office
the
chap
that
prides
himself
on
reading
such
a
lot
he
said
it
reminded
him
of
the
names
of
places
in
english
novels
that
johnny
the
biggest
snob
you
ever
set
your
tooth
into
when
i
told
him
about
the
lord
fellow
that
owns
the
castle
and
that
george
seemed
to
have
seen
him
he
nearly
fell
over
himself
never
had
any
use
for
george
before
but
just
you
watch
him
make
up
to
him
when
he
sees
him
people
were
dropping
in
and
taking
seats
at
the
tables
they
were
all
of
one
class
young
men
who
lived
in
hall
bedrooms
young
women
who
worked
in
shops
or
offices
a
couple
here
and
there
who
living
far
uptown
had
come
to
shandy
to
dinner
that
they
might
go
to
cheap
seats
in
some
theatre
afterwards
in
the
latter
case
the
girls
wore
their
best
hats
had
bright
eyes
and
cheeks
lightly
flushed
by
their
sense
of
festivity
two
or
three
were
very
pretty
in
their
thin
summer
dresses
and
flowered
or
feathered
head
gear
tilted
at
picturesque
angles
over
their
thick
hair
when
each
one
entered
the
eyes
of
the
young
men
at
the
corner
table
followed
her
with
curiosity
and
interest
but
the
glances
at
her
escort
were
always
of
a
disparaging
nature
there
a
beaut
said
nick
baumgarten
get
onto
that
pink
stuff
on
her
hat
will
you
she
done
it
because
it
just
the
colour
of
her
they
all
looked
and
the
girl
was
aware
of
it
and
began
to
laugh
and
talk
coquettishly
to
the
young
man
who
was
her
companion
i
wonder
where
she
got
clarence
said
jem
belter
in
sarcastic
allusion
to
her
escort
the
things
those
lookers
have
fastened
on
to
them
gets
if
it
was
one
of
us
now
said
bert
johnson
upon
which
they
broke
into
simultaneous
laughter
it
queer
is
it
young
baumgarten
put
in
how
a
fellow
always
feels
sore
when
he
sees
another
fellow
with
a
peach
like
that
it
just
straight
human
nature
i
the
door
swung
open
to
admit
a
newcomer
at
the
sight
of
whom
jem
belter
exclaimed
joyously
good
old
georgie
here
he
is
fellows
get
on
to
his
glad
glad
rags
is
supposed
to
buoyantly
describe
such
attire
as
by
its
freshness
or
elegance
of
style
is
rendered
a
suitable
adornment
for
festive
occasions
or
loftier
leisure
moments
glad
rags
may
mean
evening
dress
when
a
young
gentleman
wardrobe
can
aspire
to
splendour
so
marked
but
it
also
applies
to
one
best
and
garb
in
contradistinction
to
the
less
ornamental
habiliments
worn
every
day
and
designated
as
office
selden
economies
had
not
enabled
him
to
give
himself
into
the
hands
of
a
bond
street
tailor
but
a
careful
study
of
cut
and
material
as
spread
before
the
eye
in
elegant
coloured
illustrations
in
the
windows
of
respectable
shops
in
less
ambitious
quarters
had
resulted
in
the
purchase
of
a
suit
of
smart
english
cut
he
had
a
nice
young
figure
and
looked
extremely
neat
and
tremendously
new
and
clean
so
much
so
indeed
that
several
persons
glanced
at
him
a
little
admiringly
as
he
was
met
half
way
to
the
corner
table
by
his
friends
hello
old
chap
glad
to
see
you
what
sort
of
a
voyage
how
did
you
leave
the
royal
family
glad
to
get
back
they
all
greeted
him
at
once
shaking
hands
and
slapping
him
on
the
back
as
they
hustled
him
gleefully
back
to
the
corner
table
and
made
him
sit
down
say
garsong
said
nick
baumgarten
to
their
favourite
waiter
who
came
at
once
in
answer
to
his
summons
let
have
a
porterhouse
steak
half
the
size
of
this
table
and
with
plenty
of
mushrooms
and
potatoes
hashed
brown
here
selden
just
returned
from
visiting
at
windsor
castle
and
if
we
do
treat
him
well
he
look
down
on
selden
grinned
how
have
you
been
getting
on
sam
he
said
nodding
cheerfully
to
the
man
they
were
old
and
tried
friends
sam
knew
all
about
the
days
when
a
fellow
could
not
come
into
shandy
at
all
or
must
satisfy
his
strong
young
hunger
with
a
bowl
of
soup
or
coffee
and
a
roll
sam
did
his
best
for
them
in
the
matter
of
the
size
of
portions
and
they
did
their
utmost
for
him
in
the
affair
of
the
pooled
tip
been
getting
on
as
well
as
can
be
expected
sam
grinned
back
hope
you
had
a
fine
time
selden
fine
i
should
smile
fine
was
in
it
answered
selden
but
looking
forward
to
a
shandy
porterhouse
steak
all
the
did
they
give
you
a
better
one
in
the
strawnd
asked
baumgarten
in
what
he
believed
to
be
a
correct
cockney
accent
you
bet
they
did
said
selden
shandy
takes
a
lot
of
that
last
is
english
the
people
at
the
other
tables
cast
involuntary
glances
at
them
their
eager
hearty
young
pleasure
in
the
festivity
of
the
occasion
was
a
healthy
thing
to
see
as
they
sat
round
the
corner
table
they
produced
the
effect
of
gathering
close
about
selden
they
concentrated
their
combined
attention
upon
him
belter
and
johnson
leaning
forward
on
their
folded
arms
to
watch
him
as
he
talked
billy
page
came
back
in
august
looking
pretty
bum
nick
baumgarten
began
he
been
painting
gay
paree
brick
red
and
he
spent
more
money
than
he
meant
to
and
that
was
half
enough
landed
dead
broke
he
said
he
had
a
great
time
but
he
come
home
with
rather
a
dark
brown
taste
in
his
mouth
that
he
like
to
get
rid
he
thought
you
were
a
fool
to
go
off
cycling
into
the
country
put
in
wetherbee
but
i
told
him
i
guessed
that
was
where
he
was
off
i
believed
you
had
the
best
time
of
the
two
of
boys
said
selden
i
had
the
time
of
my
he
said
it
almost
solemnly
and
laid
his
hand
on
the
table
it
was
like
one
of
those
yarns
bert
tells
us
half
the
time
i
did
believe
it
and
half
the
time
i
was
ashamed
of
myself
to
think
it
was
all
happening
to
me
and
none
of
your
fellows
were
in
oh
well
said
jem
belter
luck
chases
some
fellows
anyhow
look
at
nick
well
selden
summed
the
whole
thing
up
i
just
fell
into
it
where
it
was
so
deep
that
i
had
to
strike
out
all
i
knew
how
to
keep
from
tell
us
the
whole
thing
nick
baumgarten
put
in
from
beginning
to
end
your
letter
did
give
anything
a
letter
would
have
spoiled
it
i
ca
write
letters
anyhow
i
wanted
to
wait
till
i
got
right
here
with
you
fellows
round
where
i
could
answer
questions
first
off
with
the
deliberation
befitting
such
an
opening
i
sold
machines
enough
to
pay
my
expenses
and
leave
some
you
have
gee
whiz
say
give
us
your
prescription
glad
i
know
you
georgy
and
who
do
you
suppose
bought
the
first
three
at
this
point
it
was
he
who
leaned
forward
upon
the
table
his
climax
being
a
thing
to
concentrate
upon
reuben
vanderpoel
daughter
miss
bettina
and
boys
she
gave
me
a
letter
to
reuben
himself
and
here
it
he
produced
a
flat
leather
pocketbook
and
took
an
envelope
from
an
inner
flap
laying
it
before
them
on
the
tablecloth
his
knowledge
that
they
would
not
have
believed
him
if
he
had
not
brought
his
proof
was
founded
on
everyday
facts
they
would
not
have
doubted
his
veracity
but
the
possibility
of
such
delirious
good
fortune
what
they
would
have
believed
would
have
been
that
he
was
playing
a
hilarious
joke
on
them
jokes
of
this
kind
but
not
of
this
proportion
were
common
entertainments
their
first
impulse
had
been
towards
an
outburst
of
laughter
but
even
before
he
produced
his
letter
a
certain
truthful
seriousness
in
his
look
had
startled
them
when
he
laid
the
envelope
down
each
man
caught
his
breath
it
could
not
be
denied
that
jem
belter
turned
pale
with
emotion
jem
had
never
been
one
of
the
lucky
ones
she
let
me
read
it
said
selden
taking
the
letter
from
its
envelope
with
great
care
and
i
said
to
her
vanderpoel
would
you
let
me
just
show
that
to
the
boys
the
first
night
i
go
to
shandy
i
knew
she
tell
me
if
it
was
all
right
to
do
it
she
know
want
to
be
told
and
she
just
laughed
and
said
do
mind
at
all
i
like
the
here
is
a
message
to
them
good
luck
to
you
she
said
that
from
nick
baumgarten
yes
she
did
and
she
meant
it
look
at
this
was
the
letter
it
was
quite
short
and
written
in
a
clear
definite
hand
dear
father
this
will
be
brought
to
you
by
selden
of
whom
i
have
written
to
you
please
be
good
to
him
affectionately
each
young
man
read
it
in
turn
none
of
them
said
anything
just
at
first
a
kind
of
awe
had
descended
upon
them
not
in
the
least
awe
of
vanderpoel
who
with
other
were
served
up
each
week
with
cheerful
neighbourly
comment
or
equally
neighbourly
disrespect
in
huge
sunday
papers
read
throughout
the
land
but
awe
of
the
unearthly
luck
which
had
fallen
without
warning
to
good
old
who
lived
like
the
rest
of
them
in
a
hall
bedroom
on
ten
per
earned
by
tramping
the
streets
for
the
delkoff
that
girl
said
selden
gravely
that
girl
is
a
winner
from
winnersville
i
take
off
my
hat
to
her
if
it
the
scheme
that
some
people
got
to
have
millions
and
others
have
got
to
sell
delkoffs
that
girl
one
of
those
that
entitled
to
the
millions
it
all
right
she
should
have
there
no
kick
coming
from
nick
baumgarten
was
the
first
to
resume
wholly
normal
condition
of
mind
well
i
guess
after
you
told
us
about
her
there
be
no
kick
coming
from
any
of
us
of
course
there
something
about
you
that
royal
families
cry
for
and
they
wo
be
happy
till
they
get
all
of
us
boys
knows
that
but
what
we
want
to
find
out
is
how
you
worked
it
so
that
they
saw
the
kind
of
hairpin
you
worked
it
selden
answered
i
did
work
it
i
got
a
good
bit
of
nerve
but
i
never
should
have
had
enough
to
invent
what
happened
just
happened
i
broke
my
leg
falling
off
my
bike
and
fell
right
into
a
whole
bunch
of
them
earls
and
countesses
and
viscounts
and
vanderpoels
and
it
was
miss
vanderpoel
who
saw
me
first
lying
on
the
ground
and
i
was
in
stornham
court
where
lady
anstruthers
lives
and
she
used
to
be
miss
rosalie
boys
said
bert
johnson
with
friendly
disgust
he
been
up
to
his
neck
in
cheer
up
the
worst
is
yet
to
come
chaffed
tom
wetherbee
never
had
such
a
dinner
taken
place
at
the
corner
table
or
in
fact
at
any
other
table
at
shandy
sam
brought
beefsteaks
which
were
princely
mushrooms
and
hashed
brown
potatoes
in
portions
whose
generosity
reached
the
heart
sam
was
on
good
terms
with
carver
and
had
worked
upon
his
nobler
feelings
steins
of
lager
beer
were
ventured
upon
there
was
hearty
satisfying
of
fine
hungers
two
of
the
party
had
eaten
nothing
but
one
quick
lunch
throughout
the
day
one
of
them
because
he
was
short
of
time
the
other
for
sake
because
he
was
short
of
money
the
meal
was
a
splendid
thing
the
telling
of
the
story
could
not
be
wholly
checked
by
the
eating
of
food
it
advanced
between
mouthfuls
questions
being
asked
and
details
given
in
answers
shandy
became
more
crowded
as
the
hour
advanced
people
all
over
the
room
cast
interested
looks
at
the
party
at
the
corner
table
enjoying
itself
so
hugely
groups
sitting
at
the
tables
nearest
to
it
found
themselves
excited
by
the
things
they
heard
that
young
fellow
in
the
new
suit
has
just
come
back
from
europe
said
a
man
to
his
wife
and
daughter
he
seems
to
have
had
a
good
papa
the
daughter
leaned
forward
and
spoke
in
a
low
voice
i
heard
him
say
mount
dunstan
said
lady
anstruthers
and
miss
vanderpoel
were
at
the
garden
party
who
do
you
suppose
he
is
well
he
a
nice
young
fellow
and
he
has
english
clothes
on
but
he
does
look
like
one
of
the
four
hundred
will
you
have
pie
or
vanilla
ice
cream
bessy
bessy
who
chose
vanilla
ice
cream
lost
all
knowledge
of
its
flavour
in
her
absorption
in
the
conversation
at
the
next
table
which
she
could
not
have
avoided
hearing
even
if
she
had
wished
she
bent
over
the
bed
and
laughed
just
like
any
other
nice
girl
and
she
said
are
at
stornham
court
which
belongs
to
sir
nigel
anstruthers
lady
anstruthers
is
my
sister
i
am
miss
vanderpoel
and
boys
she
used
to
come
and
talk
to
me
every
george
said
nick
baumgarten
you
take
about
bottles
of
warner
safe
cure
and
rub
yourself
all
over
with
jacob
oil
luck
like
that
ai
healthy
vanderpoel
sitting
in
his
study
wore
the
interestedly
grave
look
of
a
man
thinking
of
absorbing
things
he
had
just
given
orders
that
a
young
man
who
would
call
in
the
course
of
the
evening
should
be
brought
to
him
at
once
and
he
was
incidentally
considering
this
young
man
as
he
reflected
upon
matters
recalled
to
his
mind
by
his
impending
arrival
they
were
matters
he
had
thought
of
with
gradually
increasing
seriousness
for
some
months
and
they
had
at
first
been
the
result
of
the
letters
from
stornham
which
each
steamer
day
brought
they
had
been
of
immense
interest
to
him
these
letters
he
would
have
found
them
absorbing
as
a
study
even
if
he
had
not
deeply
loved
betty
he
read
in
them
things
she
did
not
state
in
words
and
they
set
him
thinking
he
was
not
suspected
by
men
like
himself
of
concealing
an
imagination
beneath
the
trained
steadiness
of
his
exterior
but
he
possessed
more
than
the
world
knew
and
it
singularly
combined
itself
with
powers
of
logical
deduction
if
he
had
been
with
his
daughter
he
would
have
seen
day
by
day
where
her
thoughts
were
leading
her
and
in
what
direction
she
was
developing
but
at
a
distance
of
three
thousand
miles
he
found
himself
asking
questions
and
endeavouring
to
reach
conclusions
his
affection
for
betty
was
the
central
emotion
of
his
existence
he
had
never
told
himself
that
he
had
outgrown
the
kind
and
pretty
creature
he
had
married
in
his
early
youth
and
certainly
his
tender
care
for
her
and
pleasure
in
her
simple
goodness
had
never
wavered
but
betty
had
given
him
a
companionship
which
had
counted
greatly
in
the
sum
of
his
happiness
because
imagination
was
not
suspected
in
him
no
one
knew
what
she
stood
for
in
his
life
he
had
no
son
he
stood
at
the
head
of
a
great
house
so
to
speak
the
american
parallel
of
what
a
great
house
is
in
countries
the
power
of
it
counted
for
great
things
not
in
america
alone
but
throughout
the
world
as
international
intimacies
increased
the
influence
of
such
houses
might
end
in
aiding
in
the
making
of
history
enormous
constantly
increasing
wealth
and
huge
financial
schemes
could
not
confine
their
influence
but
must
reach
far
the
man
whose
hand
held
the
lever
controlling
them
was
doing
well
when
he
thought
of
them
gravely
such
a
man
had
to
do
with
more
than
his
own
mere
life
and
living
this
man
had
confronted
many
problems
as
the
years
had
passed
he
had
seen
men
like
himself
die
leaving
behind
them
the
force
they
had
controlled
and
he
had
seen
this
force
controlled
no
longer
let
loose
upon
the
world
sometimes
a
power
of
evil
sometimes
scattering
itself
aimlessly
into
nothingness
and
folly
which
wrought
harm
he
was
not
an
ambitious
man
but
perhaps
because
he
was
not
only
a
man
of
thought
but
a
vanderpoel
of
the
blood
of
the
first
reuben
these
were
things
he
did
not
contemplate
without
restlessness
when
rosy
had
gone
away
and
seemed
lost
to
them
he
had
been
glad
when
he
had
seen
betty
growing
day
by
day
into
a
strong
thing
feminine
though
she
was
she
sometimes
suggested
to
him
the
son
who
might
have
been
his
but
was
not
as
the
closeness
of
their
companionship
increased
with
her
years
his
admiration
for
her
grew
with
his
love
power
left
in
her
hands
must
work
for
the
advancement
of
things
and
would
not
be
idly
disseminated
if
no
antagonistic
influence
wrought
against
her
he
had
found
himself
reflecting
that
after
all
was
said
the
marriage
of
such
a
girl
had
a
sort
of
parallel
in
that
of
some
young
royal
creature
whose
union
might
make
or
mar
things
which
must
be
considered
the
man
who
must
inevitably
strongly
colour
her
whole
being
and
vitally
mark
her
life
would
in
a
sense
lay
his
hand
upon
the
lever
also
if
he
brought
sorrow
and
disorder
with
him
the
lever
would
not
move
steadily
fortunes
such
as
his
grow
rapidly
and
he
was
a
richer
man
by
millions
than
he
had
been
when
rosalie
had
married
nigel
anstruthers
the
memory
of
that
marriage
had
been
a
painful
thing
to
him
even
before
he
had
known
the
whole
truth
of
its
results
the
man
had
been
a
common
adventurer
and
scoundrel
despite
the
facts
of
good
birth
and
the
air
of
decent
breeding
if
a
man
who
was
as
much
a
scoundrel
but
cleverer
it
would
be
necessary
that
he
should
be
much
cleverer
made
the
best
of
himself
to
betty
it
was
folly
to
think
one
could
guess
what
a
woman
or
a
man
either
for
that
matter
would
love
he
knew
betty
but
no
man
knows
the
thing
which
comes
as
it
were
in
the
dark
and
claims
its
own
whether
for
good
or
evil
he
had
lived
long
enough
to
see
beautiful
creatures
do
strange
things
follow
strange
gods
swept
away
into
seas
of
pain
by
strange
waves
even
betty
he
had
said
to
himself
now
and
then
even
my
betty
good
god
who
knows
because
of
this
he
had
read
each
letter
with
keen
eyes
they
were
long
letters
full
of
detail
and
colour
because
she
knew
he
enjoyed
them
she
had
a
delightful
touch
he
sometimes
felt
as
if
they
walked
the
english
lanes
together
his
intimacy
with
her
neighbours
and
her
neighbourhood
was
one
of
his
relaxations
he
found
himself
thinking
of
old
doby
and
welden
as
a
sort
of
soporific
measure
when
he
lay
awake
at
night
she
had
sent
photographs
of
stornham
of
dunholm
castle
and
of
dole
and
had
even
found
an
old
engraving
of
lady
alanby
in
her
youth
her
evident
liking
for
the
dunholms
had
pleased
him
they
were
people
whose
dignity
and
admirableness
were
part
of
general
knowledge
lord
westholt
was
plainly
a
young
man
of
many
attractions
if
the
two
were
drawn
to
each
other
and
what
more
natural
all
would
be
well
he
wondered
if
it
would
be
westholt
but
his
love
quickened
a
sagacity
which
needed
no
stimulus
he
said
to
himself
in
time
that
though
she
liked
and
admired
westholt
she
went
no
farther
that
others
paid
court
to
her
he
could
guess
without
being
told
he
had
seen
the
effect
she
had
produced
when
she
had
been
at
home
and
also
an
unexpected
letter
to
his
wife
from
milly
bowen
had
revealed
many
things
milly
having
noted
vanderpoel
eager
anxiety
to
hear
direct
news
of
lady
anstruthers
was
not
the
person
to
let
fall
from
her
hand
a
useful
thread
of
connection
she
had
written
quite
at
length
managing
adroitly
to
convey
all
that
she
had
seen
and
all
that
she
had
heard
she
had
been
making
a
visit
within
driving
distance
of
stornham
and
had
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
both
lady
anstruthers
and
miss
vanderpoel
at
various
parties
she
was
so
sure
that
vanderpoel
would
like
to
hear
how
well
lady
anstruthers
was
looking
that
she
ventured
to
write
betty
effect
upon
the
county
was
made
quite
clear
as
also
was
the
interested
expectation
of
her
appearance
in
town
next
season
vanderpoel
perhaps
gathered
more
from
the
letter
than
his
wife
did
in
her
mind
relieved
happiness
and
consternation
were
mingled
do
you
think
reuben
that
betty
will
marry
that
lord
westholt
she
rather
faltered
he
seems
very
nice
but
i
would
rather
she
married
an
american
i
should
feel
as
if
i
had
no
girls
at
all
if
they
both
lived
in
lady
bowen
gives
him
a
good
character
her
husband
said
smiling
but
if
anything
untoward
happens
annie
you
shall
have
a
house
of
your
own
half
way
between
dunholm
castle
and
stornham
when
he
had
begun
to
decide
that
lord
westholt
did
not
seem
to
be
the
man
fate
was
veering
towards
he
not
unnaturally
cast
a
mental
eye
over
such
other
persons
as
the
letters
mentioned
at
exactly
what
period
his
thought
first
dwelt
a
shade
anxiously
on
mount
dunstan
he
could
not
have
told
but
he
at
length
became
conscious
that
it
so
dwelt
he
had
begun
by
feeling
an
interest
in
his
story
and
had
asked
questions
about
him
because
a
situation
such
as
his
suggested
query
to
a
man
of
affairs
thus
it
had
been
natural
that
the
letters
should
speak
of
him
what
she
had
written
had
recalled
to
him
certain
rumours
of
the
disgraceful
old
scandal
yes
they
had
been
a
bad
lot
he
arranged
to
put
a
question
or
so
to
certain
persons
who
knew
english
society
well
what
he
gathered
was
not
encouraging
the
present
lord
mount
dunstan
was
considered
rather
a
surly
brute
and
lived
a
mysterious
sort
of
life
which
might
cover
many
things
it
was
bad
blood
and
people
were
naturally
shy
of
it
of
course
the
man
was
a
pauper
and
his
place
a
barrack
falling
to
ruin
there
had
been
something
rather
shady
in
his
going
to
america
or
australia
a
few
years
ago
good
looking
well
so
few
people
had
seen
him
the
lady
who
was
speaking
had
heard
that
he
was
one
of
those
big
rather
lumpy
men
and
had
an
expression
she
always
gave
a
wide
berth
to
a
man
who
looked
one
or
two
other
persons
who
had
spoken
of
him
had
conveyed
to
vanderpoel
about
the
same
amount
of
vaguely
unpromising
information
the
episode
of
selden
had
been
interesting
enough
with
its
suggestions
of
picturesque
contrasts
and
combinations
betty
touch
had
made
the
junior
salesman
attracting
it
was
a
good
type
this
of
a
young
fellow
who
battling
with
the
discouragements
of
a
hard
life
still
did
not
lose
his
amazing
good
cheer
and
patience
and
found
healthy
sleep
and
honest
waking
even
in
the
hall
bedroom
he
had
consented
to
betty
request
that
he
would
see
him
partly
because
he
was
inclined
to
like
what
he
had
heard
and
partly
for
a
reason
which
betty
did
not
suspect
by
extraordinary
chance
selden
had
seen
mount
dunstan
and
his
surroundings
at
close
range
vanderpoel
had
liked
what
he
had
gathered
of
mount
dunstan
attitude
towards
a
personality
so
singularly
exotic
to
himself
crude
uneducated
and
slangy
the
junior
salesman
was
not
in
any
degree
a
fool
to
an
american
father
with
a
daughter
like
betty
the
of
a
normal
common
young
denizen
of
the
united
states
fresh
from
contact
with
the
effete
might
be
subtly
instructive
and
well
worth
hearing
if
it
was
unconsciously
expressed
vanderpoel
thought
he
knew
how
after
he
had
overcome
his
visitor
first
awkwardness
if
he
chanced
to
be
he
could
lead
him
to
talk
what
he
hoped
to
do
was
to
make
him
forget
himself
and
begin
to
talk
to
him
as
he
had
talked
to
betty
to
ingenuously
reveal
impressions
and
points
of
view
young
men
of
his
clean
rudimentary
type
were
very
definite
about
the
things
they
liked
and
disliked
and
could
be
trusted
to
reveal
admiration
or
lack
of
it
without
absolute
intention
or
actual
statement
being
elemental
and
undismayed
they
saw
things
cleared
of
the
mists
of
social
prejudice
and
modification
yes
he
felt
he
should
be
glad
to
hear
of
lord
mount
dunstan
and
the
mount
dunstan
estate
from
selden
in
a
happy
moment
of
unawareness
why
was
it
that
it
happened
to
be
mount
dunstan
he
was
desirous
to
hear
of
well
the
absolute
reason
for
that
he
could
not
have
explained
either
he
had
asked
himself
questions
on
the
subject
more
than
once
there
was
no
reason
perhaps
if
betty
letters
had
spoken
of
mount
dunstan
and
his
home
they
had
also
described
lord
westholt
and
dunholm
castle
of
these
two
men
she
had
certainly
spoken
more
fully
than
of
others
of
mount
dunstan
she
had
had
more
to
relate
through
the
incident
of
selden
he
smiled
as
he
realised
the
importance
of
the
figure
of
selden
it
was
selden
and
his
broken
leg
the
two
men
had
ridden
over
from
mount
dunstan
to
visit
but
for
selden
betty
might
not
have
met
mount
dunstan
again
he
was
reason
enough
for
all
she
had
said
and
yet
perhaps
between
betty
and
himself
there
existed
the
thing
which
impresses
and
communicates
without
words
perhaps
because
their
affection
was
unusual
they
realised
each
other
emotions
the
anxiety
he
felt
now
was
not
a
new
thing
but
he
confessed
to
himself
that
it
had
been
spurred
a
little
by
the
letter
the
last
steamer
had
brought
him
it
was
not
lord
westholt
it
definitely
appeared
he
had
asked
her
to
be
his
wife
and
she
had
declined
his
proposal
i
could
not
have
liked
a
man
any
more
without
being
in
love
with
him
she
wrote
i
like
him
more
than
i
can
say
so
much
indeed
that
i
feel
a
little
depressed
by
my
certainty
that
i
do
not
love
if
she
had
loved
him
the
whole
matter
would
have
been
simplified
if
the
other
man
had
drawn
her
the
thing
would
not
be
simple
her
father
foresaw
all
the
complications
and
he
did
not
want
complications
for
betty
yet
emotions
were
perverse
and
irresistible
things
and
the
stronger
the
creature
swayed
by
them
the
more
enormous
their
power
but
as
he
sat
in
his
easy
chair
and
thought
over
it
all
the
one
feeling
predominant
in
his
mind
was
that
nothing
mattered
but
betty
nothing
really
mattered
but
betty
in
the
meantime
selden
was
walking
up
fifth
avenue
at
once
touched
and
exhilarated
by
the
stir
about
him
and
his
sense
of
it
was
pretty
good
to
be
in
little
old
new
york
again
the
hurried
pace
of
the
life
about
him
stimulated
his
young
blood
there
were
no
street
cars
in
fifth
avenue
but
there
were
carriages
waggons
carts
motors
all
pantingly
hurried
and
fretting
and
struggling
when
the
crowded
state
of
the
thoroughfare
held
them
back
the
beautifully
dressed
women
in
the
carriages
wore
no
light
air
of
being
at
leisure
it
was
evident
that
they
were
going
to
keep
engagements
to
do
things
to
achieve
objects
something
doing
something
doing
was
his
cheerful
thought
he
had
spent
his
life
in
the
midst
of
it
he
liked
it
and
it
welcomed
him
back
the
appointment
he
was
on
his
way
to
keep
thrilled
him
into
an
uplifted
mood
once
or
twice
a
chuckle
broke
from
him
as
he
tried
to
realise
that
he
had
been
given
the
chance
which
a
year
ago
had
seemed
so
impossible
that
its
mere
incredibleness
had
made
it
a
natural
subject
for
jokes
he
was
going
to
call
on
reuben
vanderpoel
and
he
was
going
because
reuben
had
made
an
appointment
with
him
he
wore
his
london
suit
of
clothes
and
he
felt
that
he
looked
pretty
decent
he
could
only
do
his
best
in
the
matter
of
bearing
he
always
thought
that
so
long
as
a
fellow
did
get
chesty
and
kept
his
head
from
swelling
he
was
all
right
of
course
he
had
never
been
in
one
of
these
swell
fifth
avenue
houses
and
he
felt
a
bit
nervous
but
miss
vanderpoel
would
have
told
her
father
what
sort
of
fellow
he
was
and
her
father
was
likely
to
be
something
like
herself
the
house
which
had
been
built
since
lady
anstruthers
marriage
was
well
and
was
big
and
imposing
when
a
manservant
opened
the
front
door
the
square
hall
looked
very
splendid
to
selden
it
was
full
of
light
and
of
rich
furniture
which
was
like
the
stuff
he
had
seen
in
one
or
two
special
shop
windows
in
fifth
avenue
places
where
they
sold
magnificent
gilded
or
carven
coffers
and
vases
pieces
of
tapestry
and
marvellous
embroideries
antiquities
from
foreign
palaces
though
it
was
quite
different
it
was
as
swell
in
its
way
as
the
house
at
mount
dunstan
and
there
were
gleams
of
pictures
on
the
walls
that
looked
fine
and
no
mistake
he
was
expected
the
man
led
him
across
the
hall
to
room
after
he
had
announced
his
name
he
closed
the
door
quietly
and
went
away
vanderpoel
rose
from
an
armchair
to
come
forward
to
meet
his
visitor
he
was
tall
and
straight
betty
had
inherited
her
slender
height
from
him
his
face
suggested
the
relationship
between
them
he
had
a
steady
mouth
and
eyes
which
looked
as
if
they
saw
much
and
far
i
am
glad
to
see
you
selden
he
said
shaking
hands
with
him
you
have
seen
my
daughters
and
can
tell
me
how
they
are
miss
vanderpoel
has
written
to
me
of
you
several
he
asked
him
to
sit
down
and
as
he
took
his
chair
selden
felt
that
he
had
been
right
in
telling
himself
that
reuben
vanderpoel
would
be
somehow
like
his
girl
she
was
a
girl
and
he
was
an
elderly
man
of
business
but
they
were
like
each
other
there
was
the
same
kind
of
straight
way
of
doing
things
and
the
same
look
in
both
of
them
it
was
queer
how
natural
things
seemed
when
they
really
happened
to
a
fellow
here
he
was
sitting
in
a
big
leather
chair
and
opposite
to
him
in
its
fellow
sat
reuben
vanderpoel
looking
at
him
with
friendly
eyes
and
it
seemed
all
right
too
not
as
if
he
had
managed
to
butt
in
and
would
find
himself
politely
fired
out
directly
he
might
have
been
one
of
the
four
hundred
making
a
call
reuben
knew
how
to
make
a
man
feel
easy
and
no
mistake
this
selden
observed
at
once
though
he
had
in
fact
no
knowledge
of
the
practical
tact
which
dealt
with
him
he
found
himself
answering
questions
about
lady
anstruthers
and
her
sister
which
led
to
the
opening
up
of
other
subjects
he
did
not
realise
that
he
began
to
express
ingenuous
opinions
and
describe
things
his
listener
interest
led
him
on
a
question
here
a
rather
pleased
laugh
there
were
encouraging
he
had
enjoyed
himself
so
much
during
his
stay
in
england
and
had
felt
his
experiences
so
greatly
to
be
rejoiced
over
that
they
were
easy
to
talk
of
at
any
time
in
fact
it
was
even
a
trifle
difficult
not
to
talk
of
them
but
stimulated
by
the
look
which
rested
on
him
by
the
deft
word
and
ready
smile
words
flowed
readily
and
without
the
restraint
of
when
you
think
that
all
of
it
sort
of
began
with
a
robin
it
queer
enough
he
said
but
for
that
robin
i
should
be
here
sir
with
a
boyish
laugh
and
he
was
an
english
robin
a
little
fellow
not
half
the
size
of
the
kind
that
hops
about
central
let
me
hear
about
that
said
vanderpoel
it
was
a
good
story
and
he
told
it
well
though
in
his
own
junior
salesman
phrasing
he
began
with
his
bicycle
ride
into
the
green
country
his
spin
over
the
fine
roads
his
rest
under
the
hedge
during
the
shower
and
then
the
song
of
the
robin
perched
among
the
fresh
wet
leafage
his
feathers
puffed
out
his
red
young
breast
pulsating
and
swelling
his
words
were
colloquial
enough
but
they
called
up
the
picture
everything
sort
of
glittering
with
the
sunshine
on
the
wet
drops
and
things
smelling
good
like
they
do
after
rain
leaves
and
grass
and
good
earth
i
tell
you
it
made
a
fellow
feel
as
if
the
whole
world
was
his
brother
and
when
mr
rob
lit
on
that
twig
and
swelled
his
red
breast
as
if
he
knew
the
whole
thing
was
his
and
began
to
let
them
notes
out
calling
for
his
lady
friend
to
come
and
go
halves
with
him
i
just
had
to
laugh
and
speak
to
him
and
that
was
when
lord
mount
dunstan
heard
me
and
jumped
over
the
hedge
he
been
listening
the
expression
reuben
vanderpoel
wore
made
it
an
agreeable
thing
to
talk
to
go
on
he
evidently
cared
to
hear
so
selden
did
his
best
and
enjoyed
himself
in
doing
it
his
style
made
for
realism
and
brought
things
clearly
before
one
the
man
in
the
rough
and
shabby
shooting
clothes
his
way
when
he
dropped
into
the
grass
to
sit
beside
the
stranger
and
talk
certain
meanings
in
his
words
which
conveyed
to
vanderpoel
what
had
not
been
conveyed
to
selden
yes
the
man
carried
a
heaviness
about
with
him
and
hated
the
burden
selden
quite
unconsciously
brought
him
out
strongly
i
do
know
whether
i
the
kind
of
fellow
who
is
always
making
breaks
he
said
with
his
boy
laugh
again
but
if
i
am
i
never
made
a
worse
one
than
when
i
asked
him
straight
if
he
was
out
of
a
job
and
on
the
tramp
it
showed
what
a
nice
fellow
he
was
that
he
did
get
hot
about
it
some
fellows
would
he
only
laughed
sort
of
short
and
said
his
job
had
been
more
than
he
could
handle
and
he
was
afraid
he
was
down
and
vanderpoel
was
conscious
that
so
far
he
was
somewhat
attracted
by
this
central
figure
selden
was
also
proving
satisfactory
in
the
matter
of
revealing
his
excellently
simple
views
of
persons
and
things
the
only
time
he
got
mad
was
when
i
would
believe
him
when
he
told
me
who
he
was
i
was
a
bit
hot
in
the
collar
myself
i
felt
sorry
for
him
because
i
thought
he
was
a
chap
like
myself
and
he
was
up
against
it
i
know
what
that
is
and
i
wanted
to
jolly
him
along
a
bit
when
he
said
his
name
was
mount
dunstan
and
the
place
belonged
to
him
i
guessed
he
thought
he
was
making
a
joke
so
i
got
on
my
wheel
and
started
off
and
then
he
got
mad
for
keeps
he
said
he
was
such
a
damned
fool
as
he
looked
and
what
he
said
was
true
and
i
could
go
and
be
reuben
vanderpoel
laughed
he
liked
that
it
sounded
like
decent
british
hot
temper
which
he
had
often
found
accompanied
honest
british
decencies
he
liked
other
things
as
the
story
proceeded
the
picture
of
the
huge
house
with
the
shut
windows
made
him
slightly
restless
the
concealed
imagination
combined
with
the
financier
resentment
of
dormant
interests
disturbed
him
that
which
had
attracted
selden
in
the
reverend
lewis
penzance
strongly
attracted
himself
also
a
man
was
a
good
deal
to
be
judged
by
his
friends
the
man
who
lived
alone
in
the
midst
of
stately
desolateness
and
held
as
his
chief
intimate
a
and
scholar
of
ripe
years
gave
in
doing
this
certain
evidence
which
did
not
tell
against
him
the
whole
situation
meant
something
a
splendid
young
creature
might
be
moved
by
might
be
allured
by
even
despite
herself
there
was
something
fantastic
in
the
odd
linking
of
incidents
chance
view
of
betty
as
she
rode
by
his
next
day
sudden
resolve
to
turn
back
and
go
to
stornham
his
accident
all
that
followed
seemed
if
one
were
fanciful
part
of
a
scheme
prearranged
when
i
came
to
myself
selden
said
i
felt
like
that
fellow
in
the
shakespeare
play
that
they
dress
up
and
put
to
bed
in
the
palace
when
he
drunk
i
thought
i
gone
off
my
head
and
then
miss
vanderpoel
he
paused
a
moment
and
looked
down
on
the
carpet
thinking
gee
whiz
it
was
queer
he
said
betty
vanderpoel
father
could
almost
hear
her
voice
as
the
rest
was
told
he
knew
how
her
laugh
had
sounded
and
what
her
presence
must
have
been
to
the
young
fellow
his
delightful
human
always
satisfying
betty
through
this
odd
trick
of
fortune
mount
dunstan
had
begun
to
see
her
since
through
the
unfair
endowment
of
nature
that
it
was
not
wholly
fair
he
had
often
told
himself
she
was
all
the
things
that
desire
could
yearn
for
there
were
many
chances
that
when
a
man
saw
her
he
must
long
to
see
her
again
and
there
were
the
same
chances
that
such
an
one
as
mount
dunstan
might
long
also
and
if
fate
was
against
him
long
with
a
bitter
strength
selden
was
not
aware
that
he
had
spoken
more
fully
of
mount
dunstan
and
his
place
than
of
other
things
that
this
had
been
the
case
had
been
because
vanderpoel
had
intended
it
should
be
so
he
had
subtly
drawn
out
and
encouraged
a
detailed
account
of
the
time
spent
at
mount
dunstan
vicarage
it
was
easily
encouraged
affectionate
admiration
for
the
vicar
led
him
on
to
enthusiasm
the
quiet
house
and
garden
the
old
books
the
afternoon
tea
under
the
copper
beech
and
the
long
talks
of
old
things
which
had
been
so
new
to
the
young
new
yorker
had
plainly
made
a
mark
upon
his
life
not
likely
to
be
erased
even
by
the
rush
of
after
years
the
way
he
knew
history
was
what
got
me
he
said
and
the
way
you
got
interested
in
it
when
he
talked
it
was
just
history
like
you
learn
at
school
and
forget
and
never
see
the
use
of
anyhow
it
was
things
about
men
just
like
yourself
hustling
for
a
living
in
their
way
just
as
we
hustling
in
broadway
most
of
it
was
fighting
and
there
are
mounds
scattered
about
that
are
the
remains
of
their
forts
and
camps
roman
camps
some
of
them
he
took
me
to
see
them
he
had
a
little
old
pony
chaise
we
trundled
about
in
and
he
draw
up
and
we
sit
and
talk
were
men
here
on
this
very
spot
he
say
out
for
attack
eating
drinking
cooking
their
food
polishing
their
weapons
laughing
and
shouting
men
selden
years
before
christ
was
born
and
sometimes
the
new
testament
times
seem
to
us
so
far
away
that
they
are
half
a
dream
that
was
the
kind
of
thing
he
say
and
i
sometimes
feel
as
if
i
heard
the
romans
shouting
the
country
about
there
was
full
of
queer
places
and
both
he
and
lord
dunstan
knew
more
about
them
than
i
know
about
you
saw
lord
mount
dunstan
often
vanderpoel
suggested
every
day
sir
and
the
more
i
saw
him
the
more
i
got
to
like
him
he
all
right
but
it
hard
luck
to
be
fixed
as
he
is
truth
what
a
man
to
do
the
money
he
ought
to
have
to
keep
up
his
place
was
spent
before
he
was
born
his
father
and
his
eldest
brother
were
a
bum
lot
and
his
grandfather
and
were
fools
he
ca
sell
the
place
and
he
would
if
he
could
penzance
was
so
fond
of
him
that
sometimes
he
say
things
but
hastily
perhaps
i
talking
too
you
happen
to
be
talking
about
questions
i
have
been
greatly
interested
in
i
have
thought
a
good
deal
at
times
of
the
position
of
the
holders
of
large
estates
they
can
not
afford
to
keep
up
this
special
instance
is
a
case
in
selden
felt
himself
in
luck
again
reuben
quite
evidently
found
his
subject
worthy
of
undivided
attention
selden
had
not
heartily
liked
lord
mount
dunstan
and
lived
in
the
atmosphere
surrounding
him
looking
about
him
with
sharp
young
new
york
eyes
without
learning
a
good
deal
he
had
seen
the
practical
hardship
of
the
situation
and
laid
it
bare
what
penzance
says
is
that
he
like
the
men
that
built
things
in
the
beginning
fought
for
them
fought
romans
and
saxons
and
normans
perhaps
the
whole
lot
at
different
times
i
used
to
like
to
get
penzance
to
tell
stories
about
the
mount
dunstans
they
were
splendid
it
must
be
pretty
fine
to
look
back
about
a
thousand
years
and
know
your
folks
have
been
something
all
the
same
its
pretty
fierce
to
have
to
stand
alone
at
the
end
of
it
not
able
to
help
yourself
because
some
of
your
relations
were
crazy
fools
i
do
wonder
he
feels
does
he
vanderpoel
inquired
he
straight
said
selden
sympathetically
he
all
right
but
only
money
can
help
him
and
he
got
none
so
he
has
to
stand
and
stare
at
things
falling
to
pieces
and
well
i
tell
you
vanderpoel
he
loves
that
place
he
crazy
about
it
and
he
proud
i
do
mean
got
the
because
he
has
but
he
just
proud
now
for
instance
he
has
any
use
for
men
like
himself
that
marry
just
for
money
he
seen
a
lot
of
it
and
it
made
him
sick
he
not
that
he
had
been
asked
and
had
answered
a
good
many
questions
before
he
went
away
but
each
had
dropped
into
the
talk
so
incidentally
that
he
had
not
recognised
them
as
queries
he
did
not
know
that
lord
mount
dunstan
stood
out
a
clearly
defined
figure
in
vanderpoel
mind
a
figure
to
be
reflected
upon
and
one
not
without
its
attraction
miss
vanderpoel
tells
me
vanderpoel
said
when
the
interview
was
drawing
to
a
close
that
you
are
an
agent
for
the
delkoff
selden
flushed
slightly
yes
sir
he
answered
but
i
did
i
hear
that
three
machines
are
in
use
on
the
stornham
estate
and
that
they
have
proved
it
a
good
machine
said
selden
his
flush
a
little
deeper
vanderpoel
smiled
you
are
a
young
man
he
said
and
i
have
no
doubt
you
have
a
catalogue
in
your
selden
was
a
young
man
he
gave
vanderpoel
one
serious
look
and
the
catalogue
was
drawn
forth
it
would
be
business
sir
for
me
to
be
caught
out
without
it
he
said
i
should
leave
it
behind
if
i
went
to
a
funeral
a
man
got
to
run
no
i
should
like
to
look
at
the
thing
had
happened
it
was
not
a
dream
reuben
vanderpoel
clothed
and
in
his
right
mind
had
without
pressure
being
exerted
upon
him
expressed
his
desire
to
look
at
the
catalogue
to
examine
it
to
have
it
explained
to
him
at
length
he
listened
attentively
while
selden
did
his
best
he
asked
a
question
now
and
then
or
made
a
comment
his
manner
was
that
of
a
thoroughly
composed
man
of
business
but
he
was
remembering
what
betty
had
told
him
of
the
ten
per
and
a
number
of
other
things
he
saw
the
flush
come
and
go
under
the
still
boyish
skin
he
observed
that
selden
hand
was
not
wholly
steady
though
he
was
making
an
effort
not
to
seem
excited
but
he
was
excited
this
actually
meant
this
thing
so
unimportant
to
that
he
was
having
his
chance
and
his
young
fortunes
were
perhaps
in
the
balance
yes
said
reuben
when
he
had
finished
it
seems
a
good
it
the
best
on
the
market
said
selden
out
and
out
the
i
understand
you
are
only
junior
salesman
yes
sir
ten
per
and
five
dollars
on
every
machine
i
sell
if
i
had
a
territory
i
should
get
then
reflectively
the
first
thing
is
to
get
a
perhaps
i
shall
get
one
in
time
if
i
keep
at
it
said
selden
courageously
it
is
a
good
machine
i
like
it
said
vanderpoel
i
can
see
a
good
many
places
where
it
could
be
used
perhaps
if
you
make
it
known
at
your
office
that
when
you
are
given
a
good
territory
i
shall
give
preference
to
the
delkoff
over
other
typewriting
machines
it
might
eh
a
light
broke
out
upon
selden
countenance
a
light
radiant
and
magnificent
he
caught
his
breath
a
desire
to
shout
to
yell
to
whoop
as
when
in
the
society
of
the
boys
was
barely
conquered
in
time
mr
vanderpoel
he
said
standing
up
i
vanderpoel
sir
i
feel
as
if
i
was
having
a
pipe
dream
i
not
am
i
no
answered
vanderpoel
you
are
not
i
like
you
selden
my
daughter
liked
you
i
do
not
mean
to
lose
sight
of
you
we
will
begin
however
with
the
territory
and
the
delkoff
i
do
think
there
will
be
any
difficulty
about
ten
minutes
later
selden
was
walking
down
fifth
avenue
wondering
if
there
was
any
chance
of
his
being
arrested
by
a
policeman
upon
the
charge
that
he
was
reeling
instead
of
walking
steadily
he
hoped
he
should
get
back
to
the
hall
bedroom
safely
nick
baumgarten
and
jem
bolter
both
roomed
in
the
house
with
him
he
could
tell
them
both
it
was
jem
who
had
made
up
the
yarn
about
one
of
them
saving
reuben
vanderpoel
life
there
had
been
no
but
the
thing
had
come
true
but
if
it
had
been
for
lord
mount
dunstan
he
said
thinking
it
over
excitedly
i
should
never
have
seen
miss
vanderpoel
and
if
it
had
been
for
miss
vanderpoel
i
should
never
have
got
next
to
reuben
in
my
life
both
sides
of
the
atlantic
ocean
got
busy
to
do
a
good
turn
to
little
willie
hully
gee
in
his
study
vanderpoel
was
rereading
betty
letters
he
felt
that
he
had
gained
a
certain
knowledge
of
lord
mount
dunstan
chapter
xxxix
on
the
marshes
the
marshes
stretched
mellow
in
the
autumn
sun
sheep
wandered
about
nibbling
contentedly
or
lay
down
to
rest
in
groups
the
sky
reflecting
itself
in
the
narrow
dykes
gave
a
blue
colour
to
the
water
a
scent
of
the
sea
was
in
the
air
as
one
breathed
it
flocks
of
plover
rose
now
and
then
crying
softly
betty
walking
with
her
dog
had
passed
a
heron
standing
at
the
edge
of
a
pool
from
her
first
discovery
of
them
she
had
been
attracted
by
the
marshes
with
their
english
suggestion
of
the
roman
campagna
their
broad
expanse
of
level
land
spread
out
to
the
sun
and
wind
the
thousands
of
white
sheep
dotted
or
clustered
as
far
as
eye
could
reach
the
hues
of
the
marsh
grass
and
the
plants
growing
thick
at
the
borders
of
the
strips
of
water
its
beauty
was
all
its
own
and
curiously
aloof
from
the
undulating
world
about
it
driving
or
walking
along
the
high
road
the
road
the
romans
had
built
to
london
town
long
centuries
ago
on
either
side
of
one
were
meadows
farms
scattered
cottages
and
hop
gardens
but
beyond
and
below
stretched
the
marsh
land
golden
and
grey
and
always
alluring
one
by
its
silence
i
never
pass
it
without
wanting
to
go
to
it
to
take
solitary
walks
over
it
to
be
one
of
the
spots
on
it
as
the
sheep
are
it
seems
as
if
lying
there
under
the
blue
sky
or
the
low
grey
clouds
with
all
the
world
held
at
bay
by
mere
space
and
stillness
they
must
feel
something
we
know
nothing
of
i
want
to
go
and
find
out
what
it
this
she
had
once
said
to
mount
dunstan
so
she
had
fallen
into
the
habit
of
walking
there
with
her
dog
at
her
side
as
her
sole
companion
for
having
need
for
time
and
space
for
thought
she
had
found
them
in
the
silence
and
aloofness
life
had
been
a
vivid
and
pleasurable
thing
to
her
as
far
as
she
could
look
back
upon
it
she
began
to
realise
that
she
must
have
been
very
happy
because
she
had
never
found
herself
desiring
existence
other
than
such
as
had
come
to
her
day
by
day
except
for
her
passionate
childish
regret
at
rosy
marriage
she
had
experienced
no
painful
feeling
in
fact
she
had
faced
no
hurt
in
her
life
and
certainly
had
been
confronted
by
no
limitations
arguing
that
girls
in
their
teens
usually
fall
in
love
her
father
had
occasionally
wondered
that
she
passed
through
no
little
episodes
of
sentiment
but
the
fact
was
that
her
interests
had
been
larger
and
more
numerous
than
the
interests
of
girls
generally
are
and
her
affectionate
intimacy
with
himself
had
left
no
such
small
vacant
spaces
as
are
frequently
filled
by
unimportant
young
emotions
because
she
was
a
logical
creature
and
had
watched
life
and
those
living
it
with
clear
and
interested
eyes
she
had
not
been
blind
to
the
path
which
had
marked
itself
before
her
during
the
growth
and
waning
she
had
not
at
first
perhaps
known
exactly
when
things
began
to
change
for
her
when
the
clarity
of
her
mind
began
to
be
disturbed
she
had
thought
in
the
beginning
as
people
have
a
habit
of
doing
that
an
instance
a
problem
a
situation
had
attracted
her
attention
because
it
was
absorbing
enough
to
think
over
her
view
of
the
matter
had
been
that
as
the
same
thing
would
have
interested
her
father
it
had
interested
herself
but
from
the
morning
when
she
had
been
conscious
of
the
sudden
fury
roused
in
her
by
nigel
anstruthers
ugly
sneer
at
mount
dunstan
she
had
better
understood
the
thing
which
had
come
upon
her
day
by
day
it
had
increased
and
gathered
power
and
she
realised
with
a
certain
sense
of
impatience
that
she
had
not
in
any
degree
understood
it
when
she
had
seen
and
wondered
at
its
effect
on
other
women
each
day
had
been
like
a
wave
encroaching
farther
upon
the
shore
she
stood
upon
at
the
outset
a
certain
ignoble
pride
she
knew
it
ignoble
filled
her
with
rebellion
she
had
seen
so
much
of
this
kind
of
situation
and
had
heard
so
much
of
the
general
comment
people
had
learned
how
to
sneer
because
experience
had
taught
them
if
she
gave
them
cause
why
should
they
not
sneer
at
her
as
at
things
she
recalled
what
she
had
herself
thought
of
such
things
the
folly
of
them
the
obviousness
the
almost
deserved
disaster
she
had
arrogated
to
herself
judgment
of
women
and
men
who
might
yes
who
might
have
stood
upon
their
strip
of
sand
as
she
stood
with
the
waves
creeping
in
each
one
higher
stronger
and
more
engulfing
than
the
last
there
might
have
been
those
among
them
who
also
had
knowledge
of
that
sudden
deadly
joy
at
the
sight
of
one
face
at
the
drop
of
one
voice
when
that
wave
submerged
one
pulsing
being
what
had
the
world
to
do
with
one
how
could
one
hear
and
think
of
what
its
speech
might
be
its
voice
clamoured
too
far
off
as
she
walked
across
the
marsh
she
was
thinking
this
first
phase
over
she
had
reached
a
new
one
and
at
first
she
looked
back
with
a
faint
even
rather
hard
smile
she
walked
straight
ahead
her
mastiff
roland
padding
along
heavily
close
at
her
side
how
still
and
wide
and
golden
it
was
how
the
cry
of
plover
and
lifting
trill
of
skylark
assured
one
that
one
was
wholly
encircled
by
solitude
and
space
which
were
more
enclosing
than
any
walls
she
was
going
to
the
mounds
to
which
penzance
had
trundled
selden
in
the
pony
chaise
when
he
had
given
him
the
marvellous
hour
which
had
brought
roman
camp
and
roman
legions
to
life
again
up
on
the
largest
hillock
one
could
sit
enthroned
resting
chin
in
hand
and
looking
out
under
level
lids
at
the
unstirring
loveliness
of
the
world
so
she
was
presently
seated
with
her
roland
at
her
feet
she
had
come
here
to
try
to
put
things
clearly
to
herself
to
plan
with
such
reason
as
she
could
control
she
had
begun
to
be
unhappy
she
had
begun
with
some
unfairness
to
look
back
upon
the
betty
vanderpoel
of
the
past
as
an
unwittingly
young
woman
to
find
herself
suddenly
entangled
by
things
even
to
know
a
touch
of
desperateness
not
to
take
a
remnant
from
the
ducal
bargain
counter
she
was
saying
mentally
that
was
why
her
smile
was
a
little
hard
what
if
the
remnant
from
the
ducal
bargain
counter
had
prejudices
of
his
own
if
he
were
passionately
passionately
in
love
with
me
she
said
with
red
staining
her
cheeks
he
would
not
come
he
would
not
come
he
would
not
come
and
because
of
that
he
is
more
to
me
more
and
more
he
will
become
every
day
and
the
more
strongly
he
will
hold
me
and
there
we
roland
lifted
his
fine
head
from
his
paws
and
holding
it
erect
on
a
stiff
strong
neck
stared
at
her
in
obvious
inquiry
she
put
out
her
hand
and
tenderly
patted
him
he
will
have
none
of
me
she
said
he
will
have
none
of
and
she
faintly
smiled
but
the
next
instant
shook
her
head
a
little
haughtily
and
having
done
so
looked
down
with
an
altered
expression
upon
the
cloth
of
her
skirt
because
she
had
shaken
upon
it
from
the
extravagant
lashes
two
clear
drops
it
was
not
the
result
of
chance
that
she
had
seen
nothing
of
him
for
weeks
she
had
not
attempted
to
persuade
herself
of
that
twice
he
had
declined
an
invitation
to
stornham
and
once
he
had
ridden
past
her
on
the
road
when
he
might
have
stopped
to
exchange
greetings
or
have
ridden
on
by
her
side
he
did
not
mean
to
seem
to
desire
ever
so
lightly
to
be
counted
as
in
the
lists
whether
he
was
drawn
by
any
liking
for
her
or
not
it
was
plain
he
had
determined
on
this
if
she
were
to
go
away
now
they
would
never
meet
again
their
ways
in
this
world
would
part
forever
she
would
not
know
how
long
it
took
to
break
him
utterly
if
such
a
man
could
be
broken
if
no
magic
change
took
place
in
his
fortunes
and
what
change
could
come
the
decay
about
him
would
spread
day
by
day
stone
walls
last
a
long
time
so
the
house
would
stand
while
every
beauty
and
stateliness
within
it
fell
into
ruin
gardens
would
become
wildernesses
terraces
and
fountains
crumble
and
be
overgrown
walls
that
were
leaning
would
fall
with
time
the
years
would
pass
and
his
youth
with
them
he
would
gradually
change
into
an
old
man
while
he
watched
the
things
he
loved
with
passion
die
slowly
and
hard
how
strange
it
was
that
lives
should
touch
and
pass
on
the
ocean
of
time
and
nothing
should
result
nothing
at
all
when
she
went
on
her
way
it
would
be
as
if
a
ship
loaded
with
every
aid
of
food
and
treasure
had
passed
a
boat
in
which
a
strong
man
tossed
starving
to
death
and
had
not
even
run
up
a
flag
but
one
can
not
run
up
a
flag
she
said
stroking
roland
one
can
not
there
we
to
her
recognition
of
this
deadlock
of
fate
there
had
been
adding
the
growing
disturbance
caused
by
yet
another
thing
which
was
increasingly
troubling
increasingly
difficult
to
face
gradually
and
at
first
with
wonderful
naturalness
of
bearing
nigel
anstruthers
had
managed
to
create
for
himself
a
singular
place
in
her
everyday
life
it
had
begun
with
a
certain
personalness
in
his
attitude
a
personalness
which
was
a
thing
to
dislike
but
almost
impossible
openly
to
resent
certainly
as
a
guest
in
his
house
she
could
scarcely
protest
against
the
amiability
of
his
demeanour
and
his
exterior
courtesy
and
attentiveness
of
manner
in
his
conduct
towards
her
she
had
tried
to
sweep
away
the
objectionable
quality
in
his
bearing
by
frankness
by
indifference
by
entire
lack
of
response
but
she
had
remained
conscious
of
its
increasing
as
a
spider
web
might
increase
as
the
spider
spun
it
quietly
over
one
throwing
out
threads
so
impalpable
that
one
could
not
brush
them
away
because
they
were
too
slight
to
be
seen
she
was
aware
that
in
the
first
years
of
his
married
life
he
had
alternately
resented
the
scarcity
of
the
invitations
sent
them
and
rudely
refused
such
as
were
received
since
he
had
returned
to
find
her
at
stornham
he
had
insisted
that
no
invitations
should
be
declined
and
had
escorted
his
wife
and
herself
wherever
they
went
what
could
have
been
conventionally
more
proper
what
more
improper
than
that
he
should
have
persistently
have
remained
at
home
and
yet
there
came
a
time
when
as
they
three
drove
together
at
night
in
the
closed
carriage
betty
was
conscious
that
as
he
sat
opposite
to
her
in
the
dark
when
he
spoke
when
he
touched
her
in
arranging
the
robe
over
her
or
opening
or
shutting
the
window
he
subtly
but
persistently
conveyed
that
the
personalness
of
his
voice
look
and
physical
nearness
was
a
sort
of
hideous
confidence
between
them
which
they
were
cleverly
concealing
from
rosalie
and
the
outside
world
when
she
rode
about
the
country
he
had
a
way
of
appearing
at
some
turning
and
making
himself
her
companion
riding
too
closely
at
her
side
and
assuming
a
noticeable
air
of
being
engaged
in
meaningly
confidential
talk
once
when
he
had
been
leaning
towards
her
with
an
audaciously
tender
manner
they
had
been
passed
by
the
dunholm
carriage
and
lady
dunholm
and
the
friend
driving
with
her
had
evidently
tried
not
to
look
surprised
lady
alanby
meeting
them
in
the
same
way
at
another
time
had
put
up
her
glasses
and
stared
in
open
disapproval
she
might
admire
a
strikingly
handsome
american
girl
but
her
favour
would
not
last
through
any
such
vulgar
silliness
as
flirtations
with
disgraceful
when
betty
strolled
about
the
park
or
the
lanes
she
much
too
often
encountered
sir
nigel
strolling
also
and
knew
that
he
did
not
mean
to
allow
her
to
rid
herself
of
him
in
public
he
made
a
point
of
keeping
observably
close
to
her
of
hovering
in
her
vicinity
and
looking
on
at
all
she
did
with
eyes
she
rebelled
against
finding
fixed
on
her
each
time
she
was
obliged
to
turn
in
his
direction
he
had
a
fashion
of
coming
to
her
side
and
speaking
in
a
dropped
voice
which
excluded
others
as
a
favoured
lover
might
she
had
seen
both
men
and
women
glance
at
her
in
at
their
sudden
sense
of
finding
themselves
slightly
de
trop
she
had
said
aloud
to
him
on
one
such
occasion
and
she
had
said
it
with
smiling
casualness
for
the
benefit
of
lady
alanby
to
whom
she
had
been
talking
do
alarm
me
by
dropping
your
voice
nigel
i
am
easily
frightened
and
lady
alanby
will
think
we
are
for
an
instant
he
was
taken
by
surprise
he
had
been
pleased
to
believe
that
there
was
no
way
in
which
she
could
defend
herself
unless
she
would
condescend
to
something
stupidly
like
a
scene
he
flushed
and
drew
himself
up
i
beg
your
pardon
my
dear
betty
he
said
and
walked
away
with
the
manner
of
an
offended
adorer
leaving
her
to
realise
an
odiously
unpleasant
truth
which
is
that
there
are
incidents
only
made
more
inexplicable
by
an
effort
to
explain
she
saw
also
that
he
was
quite
aware
of
this
and
that
his
offended
departure
was
a
brilliant
inspiration
and
had
left
her
as
it
were
in
the
lurch
to
have
said
to
lady
alanby
my
in
whose
house
i
am
merely
staying
for
my
sister
sake
is
trying
to
lead
you
to
believe
that
i
allow
him
to
make
love
to
me
would
have
suggested
either
folly
or
insanity
on
her
own
part
as
it
was
after
a
glance
at
sir
nigel
stiffly
retreating
back
lady
alanby
merely
looked
away
with
a
wholly
uninviting
expression
when
betty
spoke
to
him
afterwards
haughtily
and
with
determination
he
laughed
my
dearest
girl
he
said
if
i
watch
you
with
interest
and
drop
my
voice
when
i
get
a
chance
to
speak
to
you
i
only
do
what
every
other
man
does
and
i
do
it
because
you
are
an
alluring
young
woman
which
no
one
is
more
perfectly
aware
of
than
yourself
your
pretence
that
you
do
not
know
you
are
alluring
is
the
most
captivating
thing
about
you
and
what
do
you
think
of
doing
if
i
continue
to
offend
you
do
you
propose
to
desert
us
to
leave
poor
rosalie
to
sink
back
again
into
the
bundle
of
old
clothes
she
was
when
you
came
for
heaven
sake
do
do
that
all
that
his
words
suggested
took
form
before
her
vividly
how
well
he
understood
what
he
was
saying
but
she
answered
him
bravely
no
i
do
not
mean
to
do
he
watched
her
for
a
few
seconds
there
was
curiosity
in
his
eyes
do
make
the
mistake
of
imagining
that
i
will
let
my
wife
go
with
you
to
america
he
said
next
she
is
as
far
off
from
that
as
she
was
when
i
brought
her
to
stornham
i
have
told
her
so
a
man
can
not
tie
his
wife
to
the
bedpost
in
these
days
but
he
can
make
her
efforts
to
leave
him
so
decidedly
unpleasant
that
decent
women
prefer
to
stay
at
home
and
take
what
is
coming
i
have
seen
that
often
enough
bank
on
it
if
i
may
quote
your
american
do
you
remember
my
once
saying
betty
remarked
that
when
a
woman
has
been
properly
the
time
comes
when
nothing
matters
nothing
but
release
from
the
life
she
loathes
yes
he
answered
and
to
you
nothing
would
matter
but
excuse
my
saying
it
your
own
damnable
headstrong
pride
but
rosalie
is
different
everything
matters
to
her
and
you
will
find
it
so
my
dear
and
that
this
was
at
least
half
true
was
brought
home
to
her
by
the
fact
that
late
the
same
night
rosy
came
to
her
white
with
crying
it
is
not
your
fault
betty
she
said
do
think
that
i
think
it
is
your
fault
but
he
has
been
in
my
room
in
one
of
those
humours
when
he
seems
like
a
devil
he
thinks
you
will
go
back
to
america
and
try
to
take
me
with
you
but
betty
you
must
not
think
about
me
it
will
be
better
for
you
to
go
i
have
seen
you
again
i
have
had
you
for
for
a
time
you
will
be
safer
at
home
with
father
and
betty
laid
a
hand
on
her
shoulder
and
looked
at
her
fixedly
what
is
it
rosy
she
said
what
is
it
he
does
to
you
that
makes
you
like
this
i
do
know
but
that
he
makes
me
feel
that
there
is
nothing
but
evil
and
lies
in
the
world
and
nothing
can
help
one
against
them
those
things
he
says
about
everyone
men
and
women
things
one
repeat
make
me
sick
and
when
i
try
to
deny
them
he
does
he
say
things
about
me
betty
inquired
very
quietly
and
suddenly
rosalie
threw
her
arms
round
her
betty
darling
she
cried
go
home
go
home
you
must
not
stay
when
i
go
you
will
go
with
me
betty
answered
i
am
not
going
back
to
mother
without
she
made
a
collection
of
many
facts
before
their
interview
was
at
an
end
and
they
parted
for
the
night
among
the
first
was
that
nigel
had
prepared
for
certain
possibilities
as
wise
holders
of
a
fortress
prepare
for
siege
a
rather
long
sitting
alone
over
whisky
and
soda
had
without
making
him
loquacious
heated
his
blood
in
such
a
manner
as
led
him
to
be
less
subtle
than
usual
drink
did
not
make
him
drunk
but
malignant
and
when
a
man
is
in
the
malignant
mood
he
forgets
his
cleverness
so
he
revealed
more
than
he
absolutely
intended
it
was
to
be
gathered
that
he
did
not
mean
to
permit
his
wife
to
leave
him
even
for
a
visit
he
would
not
allow
himself
to
be
made
ridiculous
by
such
a
thing
a
man
who
could
not
control
his
wife
was
a
fool
and
deserved
to
be
a
as
ughtred
and
his
future
inheritance
seemed
to
have
become
of
interest
to
his
grandfather
and
were
to
be
well
nursed
and
taken
care
of
his
intention
was
that
the
boy
should
remain
under
his
own
supervision
he
could
amuse
himself
well
enough
at
stornham
now
that
it
had
been
put
in
order
if
it
was
kept
up
properly
and
he
filled
it
with
people
who
did
not
bore
him
there
were
people
who
did
not
bore
him
plenty
of
them
rosalie
would
stay
where
she
was
and
receive
his
guests
if
she
imagined
that
the
little
episode
of
ffolliott
had
been
entirely
dormant
she
was
mistaken
he
knew
where
the
man
was
and
exactly
how
serious
it
would
be
to
him
if
scandal
was
stirred
up
he
had
been
at
some
trouble
to
find
out
the
fellow
had
recently
had
the
luck
to
fall
into
a
very
fine
living
it
had
been
bestowed
on
him
by
the
old
duke
of
broadmorlands
who
was
the
most
old
boy
in
england
he
had
become
so
in
his
disgust
at
the
light
behaviour
of
the
wife
he
had
divorced
in
his
early
manhood
nigel
cackled
gently
as
he
detailed
that
by
an
agreeable
coincidence
it
happened
that
her
grace
had
suddenly
become
filled
with
pious
fervour
roused
thereto
by
a
locum
tenens
result
painful
discoveries
the
pair
being
now
rumoured
to
be
keeping
a
together
somewhere
in
australia
a
word
to
good
old
broadmorlands
would
produce
the
effect
of
a
lighted
match
on
a
barrel
of
gunpowder
it
would
be
the
end
of
ffolliott
neither
would
it
be
a
good
introduction
to
betty
first
season
in
london
neither
would
it
be
enjoyed
by
her
mother
whom
he
remembered
as
a
woman
with
primitive
views
of
domestic
rectitude
he
smiled
the
awful
smile
as
he
took
out
of
his
pocket
the
envelope
containing
the
words
his
wife
had
written
to
ffolliott
do
not
come
to
the
house
meet
me
at
bartyon
it
did
not
take
much
to
convince
people
if
one
managed
things
with
decent
forethought
the
brents
for
instance
were
fond
neither
of
her
nor
of
betty
and
they
had
never
forgotten
the
questionable
conduct
of
their
locum
tenens
then
suddenly
he
had
changed
his
manner
and
had
sat
down
laughing
and
drawn
rosalie
to
his
knee
and
kissed
her
yes
he
had
kissed
her
and
told
her
not
to
look
like
a
little
fool
or
act
like
one
nothing
unpleasant
would
happen
if
she
behaved
herself
betty
had
improved
her
greatly
and
she
had
grown
young
and
pretty
again
she
looked
quite
like
a
child
sometimes
now
that
her
bones
were
covered
and
she
dressed
well
if
she
wanted
to
please
him
she
could
put
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
kiss
him
as
he
had
kissed
her
that
is
what
has
made
you
look
white
said
betty
yes
there
is
something
about
him
that
sometimes
makes
you
feel
as
if
the
very
blood
in
your
veins
turned
white
answered
rosy
in
a
low
voice
which
the
next
moment
rose
do
you
see
do
you
see
she
broke
out
that
to
displease
him
would
be
like
murdering
ffolliott
like
murdering
his
mother
and
mine
and
like
murdering
ughtred
because
he
would
be
killed
by
the
shame
of
things
and
by
being
taken
from
me
we
have
loved
each
other
so
much
so
much
do
you
see
i
see
all
that
rises
up
before
you
betty
said
and
i
understand
your
feeling
that
you
can
not
save
yourself
by
bringing
ruin
upon
an
innocent
man
who
helped
you
i
realise
that
one
must
have
time
to
think
it
over
but
rosy
a
sudden
ring
in
her
voice
i
tell
you
there
is
a
way
out
there
is
a
way
out
the
end
of
the
misery
is
coming
and
it
will
not
be
what
he
you
always
believe
began
rosy
i
know
answered
betty
i
know
there
are
some
things
so
bad
that
they
can
not
go
on
they
kill
themselves
through
their
own
evil
i
know
i
know
that
is
chapter
lx
do
go
on
with
this
of
these
things
as
of
others
she
had
come
to
her
solitude
to
think
she
looked
out
over
the
marshes
scarcely
seeing
the
wandering
or
resting
sheep
scarcely
hearing
the
crying
plover
because
so
much
seemed
to
confront
her
and
she
must
look
it
all
well
in
the
face
she
had
fulfilled
the
promise
she
had
made
to
herself
as
a
child
she
had
come
in
search
of
rosy
she
had
found
her
as
simple
and
loving
of
heart
as
she
had
ever
been
the
most
painful
discoveries
she
had
made
had
been
concealed
from
her
mother
until
their
aspect
was
modified
vanderpoel
need
now
feel
no
shock
at
the
sight
of
the
restored
rosy
lady
anstruthers
had
been
still
young
enough
to
respond
both
physically
and
mentally
to
love
companionship
agreeable
luxuries
and
stimulating
interests
but
for
nigel
antagonism
there
was
now
no
reason
why
she
should
not
be
taken
home
for
a
visit
to
her
family
and
her
new
york
no
reason
why
her
father
and
mother
should
not
come
to
stornham
and
thus
establish
the
customary
social
relations
between
their
daughter
home
and
their
own
that
this
seemed
out
of
the
question
was
owing
to
the
fact
that
at
the
outset
of
his
married
life
sir
nigel
had
allowed
himself
to
commit
errors
in
tactics
a
perverse
egotism
not
wholly
normal
in
its
rancour
had
led
him
into
deeds
which
he
had
begun
to
suspect
of
having
cost
him
too
much
even
before
betty
herself
had
pointed
out
to
him
their
unbusinesslike
indiscretion
he
had
done
things
he
could
not
undo
and
now
to
his
mind
his
only
resource
was
to
treat
them
boldly
as
having
been
the
proper
results
of
decision
founded
on
sound
judgment
which
he
had
no
desire
to
excuse
a
sufficiently
arrogant
loftiness
of
bearing
would
he
hoped
carry
him
through
the
matter
this
betty
herself
had
guessed
but
she
had
not
realised
that
this
loftiness
of
attitude
was
in
danger
of
losing
some
of
its
effectiveness
through
his
being
increasingly
stung
and
spurred
by
circumstances
and
feelings
connected
with
herself
which
were
at
once
exasperating
and
at
times
almost
overpowering
when
in
his
mingled
dislike
and
admiration
he
had
begun
to
study
his
and
the
weaving
of
the
small
plots
which
would
make
things
sufficiently
unpleasant
to
be
used
as
factors
in
her
removal
from
the
scene
if
necessary
he
had
not
calculated
ever
so
remotely
on
the
chance
of
that
madness
besetting
him
which
usually
besets
men
only
in
their
youth
he
had
imagined
no
other
results
to
himself
than
a
private
entertainment
such
as
would
give
spice
to
the
dullness
of
virtuous
life
in
the
country
but
despite
himself
and
his
intentions
he
had
found
the
situation
alter
his
first
uncertainty
of
himself
had
arisen
at
the
dunholm
ball
when
he
had
suddenly
realised
that
he
was
detesting
men
who
being
young
and
free
were
at
liberty
to
pay
gallant
court
to
the
new
beauty
perhaps
the
most
disturbing
thing
to
him
had
been
his
consciousness
of
his
sudden
leap
of
antagonism
towards
mount
dunstan
who
despite
his
obvious
lack
of
chance
somehow
especially
roused
in
him
the
rage
of
warring
male
instinct
there
had
been
admissions
he
had
been
forced
at
length
to
make
to
himself
you
could
not
it
appeared
live
in
the
house
with
a
splendid
creature
like
this
one
with
her
brilliant
eyes
her
beauty
of
line
and
movement
before
you
every
hour
her
bloom
her
proud
fineness
holding
themselves
wholly
in
their
own
keeping
without
there
being
the
devil
to
pay
lately
he
had
sometimes
gone
hot
and
cold
in
realising
that
having
once
told
himself
that
he
might
choose
to
decide
to
get
rid
of
her
he
now
knew
that
the
mere
thought
of
her
sailing
away
of
her
own
choice
was
maddening
to
him
there
was
the
devil
to
pay
it
sometimes
brought
back
to
him
that
hideous
shakiness
of
nerve
which
had
been
a
feature
of
his
illness
when
he
had
been
on
the
riviera
with
teresita
of
all
this
betty
only
knew
the
outward
signs
which
taken
at
their
exterior
significance
were
detestable
enough
and
drove
her
hard
as
she
mentally
dwelt
on
them
in
connection
with
other
things
how
easy
if
she
stood
alone
to
defy
his
evil
insolence
to
do
its
worst
and
leaving
the
place
at
an
hour
notice
to
sail
away
to
protection
or
if
she
chose
to
remain
in
england
to
surround
herself
with
a
bodyguard
of
the
people
in
whose
eyes
his
disrepute
relegated
a
man
such
as
nigel
anstruthers
to
powerless
nonentity
alone
she
could
have
smiled
and
turned
her
back
upon
him
but
she
was
here
to
take
care
of
rosy
she
occupied
a
position
something
like
that
of
a
woman
who
remains
with
a
man
and
endures
outrage
because
she
can
not
leave
her
child
that
thought
in
itself
brought
ughtred
to
her
mind
there
was
ughtred
to
be
considered
as
well
as
his
mother
ughtred
love
for
and
faith
in
her
were
deep
and
passionate
things
he
fed
on
her
tenderness
for
him
and
had
grown
stronger
because
he
spent
hours
of
each
day
talking
reading
and
driving
with
her
the
simple
truth
was
that
neither
she
nor
rosalie
could
desert
ughtred
and
so
long
as
nigel
managed
cleverly
enough
the
law
would
give
the
boy
to
his
father
you
are
obliged
to
prove
things
you
know
in
a
court
of
law
he
had
said
as
if
with
casual
amiability
on
a
certain
occasion
proving
things
is
the
devil
people
lose
their
tempers
and
rush
into
rows
which
end
in
lawsuits
and
then
find
they
can
prove
nothing
if
i
were
a
villain
slightly
showing
his
teeth
in
an
agreeable
smile
instead
of
a
man
of
blameless
life
i
should
go
in
only
for
that
branch
of
my
profession
which
could
be
exercised
without
leaving
stupid
evidence
since
his
return
to
stornham
the
outward
decorum
of
his
own
conduct
had
entertained
him
and
he
had
kept
it
up
with
an
increasing
appreciation
of
its
usefulness
in
the
present
situation
whatsoever
happened
in
the
end
it
was
the
part
of
discretion
to
present
to
the
rural
world
about
him
an
appearance
of
upright
behaviour
he
had
even
found
it
amusing
to
go
to
church
and
also
to
occasionally
make
amiable
calls
at
the
vicarage
it
was
not
difficult
at
such
times
to
refer
delicately
to
his
regret
that
domestic
discomfort
had
led
him
into
the
error
of
remaining
much
away
from
stornham
he
knew
that
he
had
been
even
rather
touching
in
his
expression
of
interest
in
the
future
of
his
son
and
the
necessity
of
the
boy
being
protected
from
uncontrolled
hysteric
influences
and
in
the
years
of
rosalie
unprotected
wretchedness
he
had
taken
excellent
care
that
no
stupid
evidence
should
be
exposed
to
view
of
all
this
betty
was
thinking
and
summing
up
definitely
point
after
point
where
was
the
wise
and
practical
course
of
defence
the
most
unthinkable
thing
was
that
one
could
find
one
self
in
a
position
in
which
action
seemed
inhibited
what
could
one
do
to
send
for
her
father
would
surely
end
the
matter
but
at
what
cost
to
rosy
to
ughtred
to
ffolliott
before
whom
the
fair
path
to
dignified
security
had
so
newly
opened
itself
what
would
be
the
effect
of
sudden
confusion
anguish
and
public
humiliation
upon
rosalie
carefully
rebuilt
health
and
strength
upon
her
mother
new
hope
and
happiness
at
moments
it
seemed
as
if
almost
all
that
had
been
done
might
be
undone
she
was
beset
by
such
a
moment
now
and
felt
for
the
time
at
least
like
a
creature
tied
hand
and
foot
while
in
full
strength
certainly
she
was
not
prepared
for
the
event
which
happened
roland
stiffened
his
ears
and
beginning
a
rumbling
growl
ended
it
suddenly
realising
it
an
unnecessary
precaution
he
knew
the
man
walking
up
the
incline
of
the
mound
from
the
side
behind
them
so
did
betty
know
him
it
was
sir
nigel
looking
rather
glowering
and
pale
and
walking
slowly
he
had
discovered
where
she
had
meant
to
take
refuge
and
had
probably
ridden
to
some
point
where
he
could
leave
his
horse
and
follow
her
at
the
expense
of
taking
a
short
cut
which
saved
walking
as
he
climbed
the
mound
to
join
her
betty
rose
to
her
feet
my
dear
girl
he
said
do
get
up
as
if
you
meant
to
go
away
it
has
cost
me
some
exertion
to
find
it
will
not
cost
you
any
exertion
to
lose
me
was
her
light
answer
i
am
going
he
had
reached
her
and
stood
still
before
her
with
scarcely
a
distance
between
them
he
was
slightly
out
of
breath
and
even
a
trifle
livid
he
leaned
on
his
stick
and
his
look
at
her
combined
leaping
bad
temper
with
something
deeper
look
here
he
broke
out
why
do
you
make
such
a
point
of
treating
me
like
the
devil
betty
felt
her
heart
give
a
hastened
beat
not
of
fear
but
of
repulsion
this
was
the
mood
and
manner
which
subjugated
rosalie
he
had
so
raised
his
voice
that
two
men
in
the
distance
who
might
be
either
labourers
or
sportsmen
hearing
its
high
tone
glanced
curiously
towards
them
why
do
you
ask
me
a
question
which
is
totally
absurd
she
said
it
is
not
absurd
he
answered
i
am
speaking
of
facts
and
i
intend
to
come
to
some
understanding
about
for
reply
after
meeting
his
look
a
few
seconds
she
simply
turned
her
back
and
began
to
walk
away
he
followed
and
overtook
her
i
shall
go
with
you
and
i
shall
say
what
i
want
to
say
he
persisted
if
you
hasten
your
pace
i
shall
hasten
mine
i
can
not
exactly
see
you
running
away
from
me
across
the
marsh
screaming
you
would
care
to
be
rescued
by
those
men
over
there
who
are
watching
us
i
should
explain
myself
to
them
in
terms
neither
you
nor
rosalie
would
enjoy
there
i
knew
rosalie
name
would
pull
you
up
good
god
i
wish
i
were
a
weak
fool
with
a
magnificent
creature
protecting
me
at
all
if
she
had
not
had
blood
and
fire
in
her
veins
she
might
have
found
it
easy
to
answer
calmly
but
she
had
both
and
both
leaped
and
beat
furiously
for
a
few
seconds
it
was
only
human
that
it
should
be
so
but
she
was
more
than
a
passionate
girl
of
high
and
trenchant
spirit
and
she
had
learned
even
in
the
days
at
the
french
school
what
he
had
never
been
able
to
learn
in
his
life
she
held
herself
in
as
she
would
have
held
in
a
horse
of
too
great
fire
and
action
she
was
actually
able
to
look
as
the
first
reuben
vanderpoel
would
have
looked
at
her
capital
of
resource
but
it
meant
taut
holding
of
the
reins
will
you
tell
me
she
said
stopping
what
it
is
you
want
i
want
to
talk
to
you
i
want
to
tell
you
truths
you
would
rather
be
told
here
than
on
the
high
road
where
people
are
passing
or
at
stornham
where
the
servants
would
overhear
and
rosalie
be
thrown
into
hysterics
you
will
not
run
screaming
across
the
marsh
because
i
should
run
screaming
after
you
and
we
should
both
look
silly
here
is
a
rather
scraggy
tree
will
you
sit
on
the
mound
near
it
for
rosalie
sake
i
will
not
sit
down
replied
betty
but
i
will
listen
because
it
is
not
a
bad
idea
that
i
should
understand
you
but
to
begin
with
i
will
tell
you
she
stopped
beneath
the
tree
and
stood
with
her
back
against
its
trunk
i
pick
up
things
by
noticing
people
closely
and
i
have
realised
that
all
your
life
you
have
counted
upon
getting
your
own
way
because
you
saw
that
people
especially
women
have
a
horror
of
public
scenes
and
will
submit
to
almost
anything
to
avoid
them
that
is
true
very
often
but
not
her
eyes
which
were
well
opened
were
quite
the
blue
of
steel
and
rested
directly
upon
him
i
for
instance
would
let
you
make
a
scene
with
me
anywhere
you
chose
in
bond
street
in
piccadilly
on
the
steps
of
buckingham
palace
as
i
was
getting
out
of
my
carriage
to
attend
a
and
you
would
gain
nothing
you
wanted
by
it
nothing
you
may
place
entire
confidence
in
that
he
stared
back
at
her
momentarily
and
then
broke
forth
into
a
harsh
you
are
so
damned
handsome
that
nothing
else
matters
i
hanged
if
it
does
and
the
words
were
an
exclamation
he
drew
still
nearer
to
her
speaking
with
a
sort
of
savagery
can
not
you
see
that
you
could
do
what
you
pleased
with
me
you
are
too
magnificent
a
thing
for
a
man
to
withstand
i
have
lost
my
head
and
gone
to
the
devil
through
you
that
is
what
i
came
to
in
the
few
seconds
of
silence
that
followed
his
breath
came
quickly
again
and
he
was
even
paler
than
before
you
came
to
me
to
say
that
asked
betty
yes
to
say
it
before
you
drove
me
to
other
her
gaze
was
for
a
moment
even
slightly
wondering
he
presented
the
curious
picture
of
a
cynical
man
of
the
world
for
the
time
being
ruled
and
impelled
only
by
the
most
primitive
instincts
to
a
modern
young
woman
of
the
most
powerful
class
he
her
husband
was
making
threatening
love
as
if
he
were
a
savage
chief
and
she
a
savage
beauty
of
his
tribe
all
that
concerned
him
was
that
he
should
speak
and
she
should
hear
that
he
should
show
her
he
was
the
stronger
of
the
two
are
you
quite
mad
she
said
not
quite
he
answered
only
three
parts
but
i
am
beyond
my
own
control
that
is
the
best
proof
of
what
has
happened
to
me
you
are
an
arrogant
piece
and
you
would
defy
me
if
you
stood
alone
but
you
do
and
by
the
lord
i
have
reached
a
point
where
i
will
make
use
of
every
lever
i
can
lay
my
hand
on
yourself
rosalie
ughtred
ffolliott
the
whole
lot
of
you
the
thing
which
was
hardest
upon
her
was
her
knowledge
of
her
own
strength
of
what
she
might
have
allowed
herself
of
flaming
words
and
instant
action
but
for
the
memory
of
rosy
ghastly
little
face
as
it
had
looked
when
she
cried
out
you
must
not
think
of
me
betty
go
home
go
home
she
held
the
white
desperation
of
it
before
her
mental
vision
and
answered
him
even
with
a
certain
interested
deliberateness
do
you
know
she
inquired
that
you
are
talking
to
me
as
though
you
were
the
villain
in
the
melodrama
there
is
an
advantage
in
that
he
answered
with
an
unholy
smile
if
you
repeat
what
i
say
people
will
only
think
that
you
are
indulging
in
hysterical
exaggeration
they
do
believe
in
the
existence
of
melodrama
in
these
the
cynical
absolute
knowledge
of
this
revealed
so
much
that
nerve
was
required
to
face
it
with
steadiness
true
she
commented
now
i
think
i
no
you
do
he
burst
forth
you
have
spent
your
life
standing
on
a
golden
pedestal
being
kowtowed
to
and
you
imagine
yourself
immune
from
difficulties
because
you
think
you
can
pay
your
way
out
of
anything
but
you
will
find
that
you
can
not
pay
your
way
out
of
this
or
rather
you
can
not
pay
rosalie
way
out
of
i
shall
not
try
go
on
said
the
girl
what
i
do
not
understand
you
must
explain
to
me
do
leave
anything
good
god
what
a
woman
you
are
he
cried
out
bitterly
he
had
never
seen
such
beauty
in
his
life
as
he
saw
in
her
as
she
stood
with
her
straight
young
body
flat
against
the
tree
it
was
not
a
matter
of
deep
colour
of
eye
or
high
spirit
of
profile
but
of
something
which
burned
him
still
as
she
was
she
looked
like
a
flame
she
made
him
feel
old
and
and
all
the
more
senselessly
furious
i
believe
you
hate
me
he
raged
and
i
may
thank
my
wife
for
then
he
lost
himself
entirely
why
can
not
you
behave
well
to
me
if
you
will
behave
well
to
me
rosalie
shall
go
her
own
way
if
you
even
looked
at
me
as
you
look
at
other
men
but
you
do
not
there
is
always
something
under
your
lashes
which
watches
me
as
if
i
were
a
wild
beast
you
were
studying
do
fancy
yourself
a
dompteuse
i
am
not
your
man
i
swear
to
you
that
you
do
know
what
you
are
dealing
with
i
swear
to
you
that
if
you
play
this
game
with
me
i
will
drag
you
two
down
if
i
drag
myself
with
you
i
have
nothing
much
to
lose
you
and
your
sister
have
go
on
betty
said
briefly
go
on
yes
i
will
go
on
rosalie
and
ffolliott
i
hold
in
the
hollow
of
my
hand
as
for
you
do
you
know
that
people
are
beginning
to
discuss
you
gossip
is
easily
stirred
in
the
country
where
people
are
so
bored
that
they
chatter
in
i
have
been
considered
a
bad
lot
i
have
become
curiously
attached
to
my
i
am
seen
hanging
about
her
hanging
over
her
as
we
ride
or
walk
alone
together
an
american
young
woman
is
not
like
an
english
girl
she
is
used
to
seeing
the
marriage
ceremony
juggled
with
there
a
trifle
of
prejudice
against
such
young
women
when
they
are
too
rich
and
too
handsome
look
at
me
like
that
he
burst
forth
with
maddened
sharpness
i
have
it
the
girl
was
regarding
him
with
the
expression
he
most
resented
the
reflection
of
a
normal
person
watching
an
abnormal
one
and
studying
his
abnormality
do
you
know
that
you
are
raving
she
said
with
quiet
curiosity
raving
suddenly
he
sat
down
on
the
low
mound
near
him
and
as
he
touched
his
forehead
with
his
handkerchief
she
saw
that
his
hand
actually
shook
yes
he
answered
panting
but
my
ravings
they
mean
what
they
you
do
yourself
an
injury
when
you
give
way
to
them
steadily
even
with
a
touch
of
slow
significance
a
physical
injury
i
have
noticed
that
more
than
he
sprang
to
his
feet
again
every
drop
of
blood
left
his
face
for
a
second
he
looked
as
if
he
would
strike
her
his
arm
actually
flung
itself
out
and
fell
you
devil
he
gasped
you
count
on
that
you
she
left
her
tree
and
stood
before
him
listen
to
me
she
said
you
intimate
that
you
have
been
laying
melodramatic
plots
against
me
which
will
injure
my
good
name
that
is
rubbish
let
us
leave
it
at
that
you
threaten
that
you
will
break
rosy
heart
and
take
her
child
from
her
you
say
also
that
you
will
wound
and
hurt
my
mother
to
her
death
and
do
your
worst
to
ruin
an
honest
man
and
by
god
i
will
he
raged
and
you
can
not
stop
me
if
i
do
not
know
whether
i
can
stop
you
or
not
though
you
may
be
sure
i
will
try
she
interrupted
him
but
that
is
not
what
i
was
going
to
she
drew
a
step
nearer
and
there
was
something
in
the
intensity
of
her
look
which
fascinated
and
held
him
for
a
moment
she
was
curiously
grave
nigel
i
believe
in
certain
things
you
do
not
believe
in
i
believe
black
thoughts
breed
black
ills
to
those
who
think
them
it
is
not
a
new
idea
there
is
an
old
oriental
proverb
which
says
like
chickens
come
home
to
roost
i
believe
also
that
the
worst
the
very
worst
can
not
be
done
to
those
who
think
steadily
steadily
only
of
the
best
to
you
that
is
merely
superstition
to
be
laughed
at
that
is
a
matter
of
opinion
but
do
go
on
with
this
thing
do
go
on
with
it
stop
and
think
it
he
stared
at
her
furiously
tried
to
laugh
outright
and
failed
because
the
look
in
her
eyes
was
so
odd
in
its
strength
and
stillness
you
think
you
can
lay
some
weird
spell
upon
me
he
jeered
sardonically
no
i
do
she
answered
i
could
not
if
i
would
it
is
no
affair
of
mine
it
is
your
affair
only
and
there
is
nothing
weird
about
it
go
on
i
tell
you
think
better
of
she
turned
about
without
further
speech
and
walked
away
from
him
with
light
swiftness
over
the
marsh
oddly
enough
he
did
not
even
attempt
to
follow
her
he
felt
a
little
weak
perhaps
because
a
certain
thing
she
had
said
had
brought
back
to
him
a
familiar
touch
of
the
horrors
she
had
the
eyes
of
a
falcon
under
the
odd
soft
shade
of
the
extraordinary
lashes
she
had
seen
what
he
thought
no
one
but
himself
had
realised
having
watched
her
retreating
figure
for
a
few
seconds
he
sat
down
as
suddenly
as
before
on
the
mound
near
the
tree
oh
damn
her
he
said
his
damp
forehead
on
his
hands
damn
the
whole
universe
when
betty
and
roland
reached
stornham
the
pony
chaise
from
the
vicarage
stood
before
the
stone
entrance
steps
the
door
was
open
and
brent
was
standing
near
it
saying
some
last
words
to
lady
anstruthers
before
leaving
the
house
after
a
visit
evidently
made
with
an
object
this
betty
gathered
from
the
solemnity
of
her
manner
betty
said
lady
anstruthers
catching
sight
of
her
do
come
in
for
a
when
betty
entered
both
her
sister
and
brent
looked
at
her
questioningly
you
look
a
little
pale
and
tired
miss
vanderpoel
brent
said
rather
as
if
in
haste
to
be
the
first
to
speak
i
hope
you
are
not
at
all
unwell
we
need
all
our
strength
just
now
i
have
brought
the
most
painful
news
malignant
typhoid
fever
has
broken
out
among
the
hop
pickers
on
the
mount
dunstan
estate
some
poor
creature
was
evidently
sickening
for
it
when
he
came
from
london
three
people
died
last
chapter
xli
she
would
do
something
sir
nigel
face
was
not
a
good
thing
to
see
when
he
appeared
at
the
dinner
table
in
the
evening
as
he
took
his
seat
the
two
footmen
glanced
quickly
at
each
other
and
the
butler
at
the
sideboard
furtively
thrust
out
his
underlip
not
a
man
or
woman
in
the
household
but
had
learned
the
signal
denoting
the
moment
when
no
service
would
please
no
word
or
movement
be
unobjectionable
lady
anstruthers
face
unconsciously
assumed
its
propitiatory
expression
and
she
glanced
at
her
sister
more
than
once
when
betty
was
unaware
that
she
did
so
until
the
soup
had
been
removed
sir
nigel
scarcely
spoke
merely
making
curt
replies
to
any
casual
remark
this
was
one
of
his
simple
and
most
engaging
methods
of
at
once
enjoying
an
and
making
his
wife
feel
that
she
was
in
some
way
to
blame
for
it
mount
dunstan
is
in
a
deucedly
unpleasant
position
he
condescended
at
last
i
should
not
care
to
stand
in
his
he
had
not
returned
to
the
court
until
late
in
the
afternoon
but
having
heard
in
the
village
the
rumour
of
the
outbreak
of
fever
he
had
made
inquiries
and
gathered
detail
you
are
thinking
of
the
outbreak
of
typhoid
among
the
hop
pickers
said
lady
anstruthers
mrs
brent
thinks
it
threatens
to
be
very
an
epidemic
without
a
doubt
he
answered
in
a
wretched
unsanitary
place
like
dunstan
village
the
wretches
will
die
like
what
will
be
done
inquired
betty
he
gave
her
one
of
the
unpleasant
personal
glances
and
laughed
derisively
done
the
county
authorities
who
call
themselves
will
be
frightened
to
death
and
will
potter
about
and
fuss
like
old
women
and
profess
to
examine
and
protect
and
lay
restrictions
but
everyone
will
manage
to
keep
at
a
discreet
distance
and
the
thing
will
run
riot
and
do
its
worst
as
far
as
one
can
see
there
seems
no
reason
why
the
whole
place
should
not
be
swept
away
no
doubt
mount
dunstan
has
wisely
taken
to
his
heels
i
think
that
on
the
contrary
there
would
be
much
doubt
of
that
betty
said
he
would
stay
and
do
what
he
sir
nigel
shrugged
his
shoulders
would
he
i
think
you
find
he
would
mrs
brent
tells
me
rosalie
broke
in
somewhat
hurriedly
that
the
huts
for
the
hoppers
are
in
the
worst
possible
condition
they
are
so
dilapidated
that
the
rain
pours
into
them
there
is
no
proper
shelter
for
the
people
who
are
ill
and
lord
mount
dunstan
can
not
afford
to
take
care
of
but
he
will
he
will
broke
forth
betty
her
head
lifted
itself
and
she
spoke
almost
as
if
through
her
small
shut
teeth
a
wave
of
intense
belief
high
proud
and
obstinate
swept
through
her
it
was
a
feeling
so
strong
and
vibrant
that
she
felt
as
if
mount
dunstan
himself
must
be
reached
and
upborne
by
it
as
if
he
himself
must
hear
her
rosalie
looked
at
her
and
for
the
moment
held
fascinated
by
the
sudden
force
rising
in
her
and
by
the
splendid
spark
of
light
under
her
lids
she
was
reminded
of
the
fierce
little
betty
of
long
ago
with
her
delicate
indomitable
small
face
and
the
spirit
which
even
at
nine
years
old
had
somehow
seemed
so
strong
and
straitly
keen
of
sight
that
one
had
known
it
might
always
be
trusted
actually
in
one
way
she
had
not
changed
she
saw
the
truth
of
things
the
next
instant
however
inadvertently
glancing
towards
her
husband
she
caught
her
breath
quickly
across
his
face
had
shot
the
sudden
gleam
of
a
new
expression
it
was
as
if
he
had
at
the
moment
recognised
something
which
filled
him
with
a
rush
of
fury
he
himself
was
not
prepared
for
that
he
did
not
wish
it
to
be
seen
she
knew
by
his
manner
there
was
a
brief
silence
in
which
it
passed
away
he
spoke
after
it
with
disagreeable
precision
he
has
had
an
enormous
effect
on
you
that
man
he
said
to
betty
he
spoke
clearly
so
that
she
might
have
the
pleasure
of
being
certain
that
the
menservants
heard
they
were
close
to
the
table
handing
fruit
professing
to
be
automatons
eyes
down
faces
expressing
nothing
but
as
quick
of
hearing
as
it
is
said
that
blind
men
are
he
knew
that
if
he
had
been
in
her
place
and
a
thing
as
insultingly
significant
had
been
said
to
him
he
should
promptly
have
hurled
the
nearest
object
plate
wineglass
or
decanter
in
the
face
of
the
speaker
he
knew
too
that
women
can
not
hurl
projectiles
without
looking
like
viragos
and
fools
the
might
burst
into
tears
or
into
a
silly
rage
and
leave
the
table
there
was
a
distinct
breath
space
of
pause
and
betty
cutting
a
cluster
from
a
bunch
of
hothouse
grapes
presented
by
the
footman
at
her
side
answered
as
clearly
as
he
had
spoken
himself
he
is
strong
enough
to
produce
an
effect
on
anyone
she
said
i
think
you
feel
that
yourself
he
is
a
man
who
will
not
be
beaten
in
the
end
fortune
will
give
him
some
good
he
is
a
fellow
who
knows
well
enough
on
which
hand
of
him
good
things
lie
he
said
he
will
take
all
that
offers
why
not
betty
said
impartially
there
must
be
no
riding
or
driving
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
place
he
said
next
i
will
have
no
risks
he
turned
and
addressed
the
butler
jennings
tell
the
servants
that
those
are
my
he
sat
over
his
wine
but
a
short
time
that
evening
and
when
he
joined
his
wife
and
in
the
he
went
at
once
to
betty
in
fact
he
was
in
the
condition
when
a
man
can
not
keep
away
from
a
woman
but
must
invent
some
reason
for
reaching
her
whether
it
is
fatuous
or
plausible
what
i
said
to
jennings
was
an
order
to
you
as
well
as
to
the
people
below
stairs
i
know
you
are
particularly
fond
of
riding
in
the
direction
of
mount
dunstan
you
are
in
my
care
so
long
as
you
are
in
my
orders
are
not
necessary
betty
replied
the
day
is
past
when
one
rushed
to
smooth
pillows
and
give
the
wrong
medicine
when
one
friends
were
ill
if
one
is
not
a
nurse
it
is
wiser
not
to
risk
being
very
much
in
the
he
spoke
over
her
shoulder
dropping
his
voice
though
lady
anstruthers
sat
apart
appearing
to
read
do
think
i
am
fool
enough
not
to
understand
you
have
yourself
under
magnificent
control
but
a
woman
passionately
in
love
can
not
keep
a
certain
look
out
of
her
he
was
standing
on
the
hearth
betty
swung
herself
lightly
round
facing
him
squarely
her
full
look
was
splendid
if
it
is
there
let
it
stay
she
said
i
would
not
keep
it
out
of
my
eyes
if
i
could
and
you
are
right
i
could
not
if
i
would
if
it
is
there
if
it
is
let
it
the
daring
throbbing
human
truth
of
her
made
his
brain
whirl
to
a
man
young
and
clean
and
fit
to
count
as
in
the
lists
to
have
heard
her
say
the
thing
of
a
rival
would
have
been
hard
enough
but
base
degenerate
and
of
the
world
behind
her
day
to
hear
it
while
frenzied
for
her
was
intolerable
and
it
was
mount
dunstan
she
bore
herself
so
highly
for
whether
melodrama
is
out
of
date
or
not
there
are
occasionally
some
fine
melodramatic
touches
in
the
enmities
of
you
think
you
will
reach
him
he
persisted
you
think
you
will
help
him
in
some
way
you
will
not
let
the
thing
excuse
my
mentioning
that
whatsoever
i
take
the
liberty
of
doing
will
encroach
on
no
right
of
yours
she
said
but
alone
in
her
room
after
she
went
upstairs
the
face
reflecting
itself
in
the
mirror
was
pale
and
its
black
brows
were
drawn
together
she
sat
down
at
the
and
seeing
the
paled
face
drew
the
black
brows
closer
confronting
a
complicating
truth
if
i
were
free
to
take
rosalie
and
ughtred
home
she
thought
i
could
not
bear
to
go
i
should
suffer
too
she
was
suffering
now
the
strong
longing
in
her
heart
was
like
a
physical
pain
no
word
or
look
of
this
one
man
had
given
her
proof
that
his
thoughts
turned
to
her
and
yet
it
was
intolerable
intolerable
that
in
his
hour
of
stress
and
need
they
were
as
wholly
apart
as
if
worlds
rolled
between
them
at
any
dire
moment
it
was
mere
nature
that
she
should
give
herself
in
help
and
support
if
on
the
night
at
sea
when
they
had
first
spoken
to
each
other
the
ship
had
gone
down
she
knew
that
they
two
strangers
though
they
were
would
have
worked
side
by
side
among
the
frantic
people
and
have
been
among
the
last
to
take
to
the
boats
how
did
she
know
only
because
he
being
he
and
she
being
she
it
must
have
been
so
in
accordance
with
the
laws
ruling
entities
and
now
he
stood
facing
a
calamity
almost
as
terrible
and
she
with
full
hands
sat
still
she
had
seen
the
hop
pickers
huts
and
had
recognised
their
condition
mere
brick
sheds
in
which
the
pickers
slept
upon
bundles
of
hay
or
straw
in
their
best
days
in
their
decay
they
did
not
even
provide
shelter
in
fine
weather
the
hop
gatherers
slept
well
enough
in
them
cooking
their
food
in
in
the
open
when
the
rain
descended
it
must
run
down
walls
and
drip
through
the
holes
in
the
roofs
in
streams
which
would
soak
clothes
and
bedding
the
worst
that
nigel
and
brent
had
implied
was
true
illness
of
any
order
under
such
circumstances
would
have
small
chance
of
recovery
but
malignant
typhoid
without
shelter
without
proper
nourishment
or
nursing
had
not
one
chance
in
a
million
and
he
this
one
man
stood
alone
in
the
midst
of
the
tragedy
responsible
and
helpless
he
would
feel
himself
responsible
as
she
herself
would
if
she
were
in
his
place
she
was
conscious
that
suddenly
the
event
of
the
afternoon
the
interview
upon
the
marshes
had
receded
until
it
had
become
an
almost
unmeaning
incident
what
did
the
degenerate
melodramatic
folly
matter
she
had
restlessly
left
her
chair
before
the
and
was
walking
to
and
fro
she
paused
and
stood
looking
down
at
the
carpet
though
she
scarcely
saw
it
nothing
matters
but
one
thing
one
person
she
owned
to
herself
aloud
i
suppose
it
is
always
like
this
rosy
ughtred
even
father
and
mother
everyone
seems
less
near
than
they
were
it
is
too
strong
too
strong
it
is
the
words
dropped
slowly
from
her
lips
the
strongest
thing
in
the
she
lifted
her
face
and
threw
out
her
hands
a
lovely
young
smile
curling
the
deep
corners
of
her
mouth
sometimes
one
feels
so
disdained
she
said
so
disdained
with
all
one
power
perhaps
i
am
an
unwanted
but
even
in
this
case
there
were
aids
one
might
make
an
effort
to
give
she
went
to
her
and
sat
thinking
for
some
time
afterwards
she
began
to
write
letters
three
or
four
were
addressed
to
london
one
was
to
penzance
mount
dunstan
and
his
vicar
were
walking
through
the
village
to
the
vicarage
they
had
been
to
the
hop
pickers
huts
to
see
the
people
who
were
ill
of
the
fever
both
of
them
noticed
that
cottage
doors
and
windows
were
shut
and
that
here
and
there
alarmed
faces
looked
out
from
behind
latticed
panes
they
are
in
a
panic
of
fear
mount
dunstan
said
and
by
way
of
safeguard
they
shut
out
every
breath
of
air
and
stifle
indoors
something
must
be
catching
the
eye
of
a
woman
who
was
peering
over
her
short
white
dimity
blind
he
beckoned
to
her
authoritatively
she
came
to
the
door
and
hesitated
there
curtsying
nervously
mount
dunstan
spoke
to
her
across
the
hedge
you
need
not
come
out
to
me
binner
you
may
stay
where
you
are
he
said
are
you
obeying
the
orders
given
by
the
guardians
yes
my
lord
yes
my
lord
with
more
curtsys
your
health
is
very
much
in
your
own
hands
he
added
you
must
keep
your
cottage
and
your
children
cleaner
than
you
have
ever
kept
them
before
and
you
must
use
the
disinfectant
i
sent
you
keep
away
from
the
huts
and
open
your
windows
if
you
do
open
them
i
shall
come
and
do
it
for
you
bad
air
is
infection
itself
do
you
understand
yes
my
lord
thank
your
go
in
and
open
your
windows
now
and
tell
your
neighbours
to
do
the
same
if
anyone
is
ill
let
me
know
at
once
the
vicar
and
i
will
do
our
best
for
by
that
time
curiosity
had
overcome
fear
and
other
cottage
doors
had
opened
mount
dunstan
passed
down
the
row
and
said
a
few
words
to
each
woman
or
man
who
looked
out
questions
were
asked
anxiously
and
he
answered
them
that
he
was
personally
unafraid
was
comfortingly
plain
and
the
mere
sight
of
him
was
on
the
whole
an
unexplainable
support
we
heard
said
your
lordship
was
going
away
put
in
a
stout
mother
with
a
heavy
child
on
her
arm
a
slight
testiness
scarcely
concealed
by
respectful
she
was
a
matron
with
a
temper
and
that
a
mount
dunstan
should
avoid
responsibilities
seemed
highly
credible
i
shall
stay
where
i
am
mount
dunstan
answered
my
place
is
they
believed
him
mount
dunstan
though
he
was
it
could
not
be
said
that
they
were
fond
of
him
but
gradually
it
had
been
borne
in
upon
them
that
his
word
was
to
be
relied
on
though
his
manner
was
unalluring
and
they
knew
he
was
too
poor
to
do
his
duty
by
them
or
his
estate
as
he
walked
away
with
the
vicar
windows
were
opened
and
in
one
or
two
untidy
cottages
a
sudden
flourishing
of
mops
and
brooms
began
there
was
dark
trouble
in
mount
dunstan
face
in
the
huts
they
had
left
two
men
stiff
on
their
straw
and
two
women
and
a
child
in
a
state
of
collapse
added
to
these
were
others
stricken
helpless
a
number
of
workers
in
the
hop
gardens
on
realising
the
danger
threatening
them
had
gathered
together
bundles
and
children
and
leaving
the
harvest
behind
had
gone
on
the
tramp
again
those
who
remained
were
the
weaker
or
less
cautious
or
were
held
by
some
tie
to
those
who
were
already
ill
of
the
fever
the
village
doctor
was
an
old
man
who
had
spent
his
blameless
life
in
bringing
little
cottagers
into
the
world
attending
their
measles
and
whooping
coughs
and
their
father
and
rheumatics
he
had
never
faced
a
village
crisis
in
the
course
of
his
years
and
was
aghast
and
flurried
with
fright
his
methods
remained
those
of
his
youth
and
were
marked
chiefly
by
a
readiness
to
prescribe
calomel
in
any
emergency
a
younger
and
stronger
man
was
needed
as
well
as
a
man
of
more
modern
training
but
even
the
most
brilliant
practitioner
of
the
hour
could
not
have
provided
shelter
and
nourishment
and
without
them
his
skill
would
have
counted
as
nothing
for
three
weeks
there
had
been
no
rain
which
was
a
condition
of
the
barometer
not
likely
to
last
already
grey
clouds
were
gathering
and
obscuring
the
blueness
of
the
sky
the
vicar
glanced
upwards
anxiously
when
it
comes
he
said
there
will
be
a
downpour
and
a
persistent
yes
mount
dunstan
answered
he
had
lain
awake
thinking
throughout
the
night
how
was
a
man
to
sleep
it
was
as
betty
vanderpoel
had
known
it
would
be
he
who
beggar
though
he
might
be
was
the
lord
of
the
land
was
the
man
to
face
the
strait
of
these
poor
workers
on
the
land
as
his
own
some
action
must
be
taken
what
action
as
he
walked
by
his
friend
side
from
the
huts
where
the
dead
men
lay
it
revealed
itself
that
he
saw
his
way
they
were
going
to
the
vicarage
to
consult
a
medical
book
but
on
the
way
there
they
passed
a
part
of
the
park
where
through
a
break
in
the
timber
the
huge
white
house
stood
on
view
mount
dunstan
laid
his
hand
on
penzance
shoulder
and
stopped
him
look
there
he
said
there
are
rooms
a
startled
expression
showed
itself
on
the
vicar
face
for
what
he
exclaimed
for
a
hospital
brusquely
i
can
give
them
one
thing
at
least
it
is
a
very
remarkable
thing
to
think
of
doing
penzance
said
it
is
not
so
remarkable
as
that
labourers
on
my
land
should
die
at
my
gate
because
i
can
not
give
them
decent
roofs
to
cover
them
there
is
a
roof
that
will
shield
them
from
the
weather
they
shall
be
brought
to
the
the
vicar
was
silent
a
moment
and
a
flush
of
sympathy
warmed
his
face
you
are
quite
right
fergus
he
said
entirely
let
us
go
to
your
study
and
plan
how
it
shall
be
done
mount
dunstan
said
as
they
walked
towards
the
vicarage
he
went
on
talking
when
i
lie
awake
at
night
there
is
one
thread
which
always
winds
itself
through
my
thoughts
whatsoever
they
are
i
do
find
that
i
can
disentangle
it
it
connects
itself
with
reuben
vanderpoel
daughter
you
would
know
that
without
my
telling
you
if
you
had
ever
struggled
with
an
insane
passion
it
is
not
insane
i
repeat
put
in
penzance
unflinchingly
thank
you
whether
you
are
right
or
wrong
answered
mount
dunstan
striding
by
his
side
when
i
am
awake
she
is
as
much
a
part
of
my
existence
as
my
breath
itself
when
i
think
things
over
i
find
that
i
am
asking
myself
if
her
thoughts
would
be
like
mine
she
is
a
creature
of
action
last
night
as
i
lay
awake
i
said
to
myself
would
do
something
what
would
she
do
she
would
not
be
held
back
by
fear
of
comment
or
convention
she
would
look
about
her
for
the
utilisable
and
she
would
find
it
somewhere
and
use
it
i
began
to
sum
up
the
village
resources
and
found
nothing
until
my
thoughts
led
me
to
my
own
house
there
it
stood
empty
and
useless
if
it
were
hers
and
she
stood
in
my
place
she
would
make
it
useful
so
i
you
are
quite
right
penzance
said
again
they
spent
an
hour
in
his
library
at
the
vicarage
arranging
practical
methods
for
transforming
the
great
ballroom
into
a
sort
of
hospital
ward
it
could
be
done
by
the
removal
of
pieces
of
furniture
from
the
many
unused
bedrooms
there
was
also
the
transportation
of
the
patients
from
the
huts
to
be
provided
for
but
when
all
this
was
planned
out
each
found
himself
looking
at
the
other
with
an
unspoken
thought
in
his
mind
mount
dunstan
first
expressed
it
as
far
as
i
can
gather
the
safety
of
typhoid
fever
patients
depends
almost
entirely
on
scientific
nursing
and
the
caution
with
which
even
liquid
nourishment
is
given
the
woman
whose
husband
died
this
morning
told
me
that
he
had
seemed
better
in
the
night
and
had
asked
for
something
to
eat
she
gave
him
a
piece
of
bread
and
a
slice
of
cold
bacon
because
he
told
her
he
fancied
it
i
could
not
explain
to
her
as
she
sat
sobbing
over
him
that
she
had
probably
killed
him
when
we
have
patients
in
our
ward
what
shall
we
feed
them
on
and
who
will
know
how
to
nurse
them
they
do
not
know
how
to
nurse
each
other
and
the
women
in
the
village
would
not
run
the
risk
of
undertaking
to
help
but
even
before
he
had
left
the
house
the
problem
was
solved
for
them
the
solving
of
it
lay
in
the
note
miss
vanderpoel
had
written
the
night
before
at
stornham
when
it
was
brought
to
him
penzance
glanced
up
from
certain
calculations
he
was
making
upon
a
sheet
of
the
accumulating
difficulties
made
him
look
worn
and
tired
he
opened
the
note
and
read
it
gravely
and
then
as
gravely
though
with
a
change
of
expression
handed
it
to
mount
dunstan
yes
she
is
a
creature
of
action
she
has
heard
and
understood
at
once
and
she
has
done
something
it
is
immensely
practical
it
is
fine
it
it
is
do
you
mind
my
keeping
it
mount
dunstan
asked
after
he
had
read
it
keep
it
by
all
means
the
vicar
answered
it
is
worth
but
it
was
quite
brief
she
had
heard
of
the
outbreak
of
fever
among
the
hop
pickers
and
asked
to
be
allowed
to
give
help
to
the
people
who
were
suffering
they
would
need
prompt
aid
she
chanced
to
know
something
of
the
requirements
of
such
cases
and
had
written
to
london
for
certain
supplies
which
would
be
sent
to
them
at
once
she
had
also
written
for
nurses
who
would
be
needed
above
all
else
might
she
ask
penzance
to
kindly
call
upon
her
for
any
further
assistance
required
tell
her
we
are
deeply
grateful
said
mount
dunstan
and
that
she
has
given
us
greater
help
than
she
why
not
answer
her
note
yourself
penzance
suggested
mount
dunstan
shook
his
head
no
he
said
shortly
chapter
xlii
in
the
ballroom
though
dunstan
village
was
cut
off
by
its
misfortune
from
its
usual
intercourse
with
its
neighbours
in
some
mystic
manner
villages
even
at
twenty
miles
distance
learned
all
it
did
and
suffered
feared
or
hoped
it
did
not
hope
greatly
the
rustic
habit
of
mind
tending
towards
a
discouraged
outlook
and
cherishing
the
drama
of
impending
calamity
as
far
as
yangford
and
marling
inmates
of
cottages
and
farmhouses
were
inclined
to
think
it
probable
that
dunstan
would
be
swep
away
and
rumours
of
spreading
death
and
disaster
were
popular
tread
the
advanced
blacksmith
at
stornham
having
heard
in
his
better
days
of
the
great
plague
of
london
was
greatly
in
demand
as
a
narrator
of
illuminating
anecdotes
at
the
clock
inn
among
the
parties
gathered
at
the
large
houses
mount
dunstan
himself
was
much
talked
of
if
he
had
been
a
popular
man
he
might
have
become
a
sort
of
hero
as
he
was
not
popular
he
was
merely
a
subject
for
discussion
the
patients
had
been
carried
in
carts
to
the
mount
and
given
beds
in
the
ballroom
which
had
been
made
into
a
temporary
ward
nurses
and
supplies
had
been
sent
for
from
london
and
two
energetic
young
doctors
had
taken
the
place
of
old
fenwick
who
had
been
frightened
and
overworked
into
an
attack
of
bronchitis
which
confined
him
to
his
bed
where
the
money
came
from
which
must
be
spent
every
day
under
such
circumstances
it
was
difficult
to
say
to
the
simply
conservative
of
mind
the
idea
of
filling
one
house
with
dirty
east
end
hop
pickers
infected
with
typhoid
seemed
too
radical
surely
he
could
have
done
something
less
extraordinary
would
everybody
be
expected
to
turn
their
houses
into
hospitals
in
case
of
village
epidemics
now
that
he
had
established
a
precedent
but
there
were
people
who
approved
and
were
warm
in
their
sympathy
with
him
at
the
first
dinner
party
where
the
matter
was
made
the
subject
of
argument
the
beautiful
miss
vanderpoel
who
was
present
listened
silently
to
the
talk
with
such
brilliant
eyes
that
lord
dunholm
who
was
in
an
elderly
way
her
staunch
admirer
spoke
to
her
across
the
table
tell
us
what
you
think
of
it
miss
vanderpoel
he
suggested
she
did
not
hesitate
at
all
i
like
it
she
answered
in
her
clear
voice
i
like
it
better
than
anything
i
have
ever
so
do
i
said
old
lady
alanby
shortly
i
should
never
have
done
it
myself
but
i
like
it
just
as
you
i
knew
you
would
lady
alanby
said
the
girl
and
you
too
lord
i
like
it
so
much
that
i
shall
write
and
ask
if
i
can
not
be
of
assistance
lord
dunholm
answered
betty
was
glad
to
hear
this
only
quickness
of
thought
prevented
her
from
the
error
of
saying
thank
you
as
if
the
matter
were
personal
to
herself
if
mount
dunstan
was
restive
under
the
obviousness
of
the
fact
that
help
was
so
sorely
needed
he
might
feel
less
so
if
her
offer
was
only
one
among
others
it
seems
rather
the
duty
of
the
neighbourhood
to
show
some
interest
put
in
lady
alanby
i
shall
write
to
him
myself
he
is
evidently
of
a
new
order
of
mount
dunstan
it
to
be
hoped
he
wo
take
the
fever
himself
and
die
of
it
he
ought
to
marry
some
handsome
girl
and
the
nigel
anstruthers
spoke
from
his
side
of
the
table
leaning
slightly
forward
he
wo
if
he
does
not
take
better
care
of
himself
he
passed
me
on
the
road
two
days
ago
riding
like
a
lunatic
he
looks
frightfully
ill
yellow
and
drawn
and
lined
he
has
not
lived
the
life
to
prepare
him
for
settling
down
to
a
fight
with
typhoid
fever
he
would
be
done
for
if
he
caught
the
i
beg
your
pardon
said
lord
dunholm
with
quiet
decision
unprejudiced
inquiry
proves
that
his
life
has
been
entirely
respectable
as
lady
alanby
says
he
seems
to
be
of
a
new
order
of
mount
no
doubt
you
are
right
said
sir
nigel
suavely
he
looked
ill
as
to
looking
ill
remarked
lady
alanby
to
lord
dunholm
who
sat
near
her
that
man
looks
as
if
he
was
going
to
pieces
pretty
rapidly
himself
and
unprejudiced
inquiry
would
not
prove
that
his
past
had
nothing
to
do
with
betty
wondered
if
her
were
lying
it
was
generally
safest
to
argue
that
he
was
but
the
fever
burned
high
at
mount
dunstan
and
she
knew
by
instinct
what
its
owner
was
giving
of
the
strength
of
his
body
and
brain
a
young
unmarried
woman
can
not
go
about
however
making
anxious
inquiries
concerning
the
welfare
of
a
man
who
has
made
no
advance
towards
her
she
must
wait
for
the
chance
which
brings
news
the
fever
having
for
and
habitually
ill
fed
bodies
to
work
upon
wrought
fiercely
despite
the
energy
of
the
two
young
doctors
and
the
trained
nurses
there
were
many
dark
hours
in
the
ballroom
ward
hours
filled
with
groans
and
wild
ravings
the
floating
terpsichorean
goddesses
upon
the
lofty
ceiling
gazed
down
with
wondering
eyes
at
haggard
faces
and
plucking
hands
which
sometimes
behind
the
screen
drawn
round
their
beds
ceased
to
look
feverish
and
grew
paler
and
stiller
until
they
moved
no
more
but
at
least
none
had
died
through
want
of
shelter
and
care
the
supplies
needed
came
from
london
each
day
lord
dunholm
had
sent
a
generous
cheque
to
the
aid
of
the
sufferers
and
so
also
had
old
lady
alanby
but
miss
vanderpoel
consulting
medical
authorities
and
hospitals
learned
exactly
what
was
required
and
necessities
were
forwarded
daily
in
their
most
easily
utilisable
form
you
generously
told
me
to
ask
you
for
anything
we
found
we
required
penzance
wrote
to
her
in
his
note
of
thanks
my
dear
and
kind
young
lady
you
leave
nothing
to
ask
for
our
doctors
who
are
young
and
enthusiastic
are
filled
with
delight
in
the
completeness
of
the
resources
placed
in
their
she
had
in
fact
gone
to
london
to
consult
an
eminent
physician
who
was
an
authority
of
reputation
like
the
head
of
the
legal
firm
of
townlinson
sheppard
he
had
experienced
a
new
sensation
in
the
visit
paid
him
by
an
indubitably
modern
young
beauty
who
wasted
no
word
and
whose
eyes
while
he
answered
her
amazingly
clear
questions
were
as
intelligently
intent
as
those
of
an
ardent
and
serious
young
medical
student
what
a
surgical
nurse
she
would
have
made
it
seemed
almost
a
pity
that
she
evidently
belonged
to
a
class
the
members
of
which
are
rich
enough
to
undertake
the
charge
of
entire
epidemics
but
who
do
not
usually
give
themselves
to
such
work
especially
when
they
are
young
and
astonishing
in
the
matter
of
looks
in
addition
to
the
work
they
did
in
the
ballroom
ward
mount
dunstan
and
the
vicar
found
much
to
do
among
the
villagers
ignorance
and
alarm
combined
to
create
dangers
even
where
they
might
not
have
been
feared
daily
instruction
and
inspection
of
the
cottages
and
their
inmates
was
required
the
knowledge
that
they
were
under
control
and
supervision
was
a
support
to
the
frightened
people
and
prevented
their
lapsing
into
careless
habits
also
there
began
to
develop
among
them
a
secret
dependence
upon
and
desire
to
please
his
lordship
as
the
existing
circumstances
drew
him
nearer
to
them
and
unconsciously
they
were
attracted
and
dominated
by
his
strength
the
strong
man
carries
his
power
with
him
and
when
mount
dunstan
entered
a
cottage
and
talked
to
its
inmates
the
anxious
wife
or
surlily
depressed
husband
was
conscious
of
feeling
a
certain
sense
of
security
it
had
been
a
queer
enough
thing
this
he
had
done
bundling
the
infected
hoppers
out
of
their
leaking
huts
and
carrying
them
up
to
the
mount
itself
for
shelter
and
care
at
the
most
gentlefolk
generally
gave
soup
or
blankets
or
hospital
tickets
and
left
the
rest
to
luck
but
or
not
a
man
who
did
a
thing
like
that
would
be
likely
to
do
other
things
if
they
were
needed
and
gave
folk
a
feeling
of
being
safer
than
ordinary
soup
and
blankets
and
hospital
tickets
could
make
them
but
where
did
the
money
come
from
was
asked
during
the
first
days
beds
and
doctors
nurses
and
medicine
fine
brandy
and
unlimited
fowls
for
broth
did
not
come
up
from
london
without
being
paid
for
pounds
and
pounds
a
day
must
be
paid
out
to
get
the
things
that
were
delivered
regular
in
hampers
and
boxes
the
women
talked
to
one
another
over
their
garden
palings
the
men
argued
together
over
their
beer
at
the
public
house
was
he
running
into
more
debt
but
even
the
village
knew
that
mount
dunstan
credit
had
been
exhausted
long
ago
and
there
had
been
no
money
at
the
mount
within
the
memory
of
man
so
to
speak
one
morning
the
matron
with
the
sharp
temper
found
out
the
truth
though
the
outburst
of
gratitude
to
mount
dunstan
which
resulted
in
her
enlightenment
was
entirely
spontaneous
and
without
intention
her
doubt
of
his
mount
dunstan
blood
had
grown
into
a
sturdy
liking
even
for
his
short
speech
and
his
often
brows
we
got
more
to
thank
your
lordship
for
than
common
help
she
said
god
almighty
knows
where
we
all
ha
been
but
for
what
you
done
those
poor
souls
you
nursed
and
fed
i
not
done
it
he
broke
in
promptly
you
mistaken
i
could
not
have
done
it
how
could
i
well
exclaimed
the
matron
frankly
we
was
wondering
where
things
came
you
might
well
wonder
have
any
of
you
seen
lady
anstruthers
sister
miss
vanderpoel
ride
through
the
village
she
used
sometimes
to
ride
this
way
if
you
saw
her
you
will
remember
it
the
young
lady
in
ejaculatory
delight
my
word
yes
a
fine
young
woman
with
black
hair
that
rich
they
say
as
millions
cover
they
wo
grimly
lord
dunholm
and
lady
alanby
of
dole
kindly
sent
cheques
to
help
us
but
the
american
young
lady
was
first
on
the
field
she
sent
both
doctors
and
nurses
and
has
supplied
us
with
food
and
medicine
every
day
as
you
say
brown
god
almighty
knows
what
would
have
become
of
us
but
for
what
she
has
brown
had
listened
with
rather
open
mouth
she
caught
her
breath
heartily
as
a
sort
of
approving
exclamation
god
bless
her
she
broke
out
girls
is
generally
like
that
their
heads
is
too
full
of
finery
god
bless
her
or
no
that
what
i
mount
dunstan
eyes
looked
as
if
she
had
pleased
him
that
what
i
say
too
he
answered
god
bless
her
there
was
not
a
day
which
passed
in
which
he
did
not
involuntarily
say
the
words
to
himself
again
and
again
she
had
been
wrong
when
she
had
said
in
her
musings
that
they
were
as
far
apart
as
if
worlds
rolled
between
them
something
stronger
than
sight
or
speech
drew
them
together
the
thread
which
wove
itself
through
his
thoughts
grew
stronger
and
stronger
the
first
day
her
gifts
arrived
and
he
walked
about
the
ballroom
ward
directing
the
placing
of
hospital
cots
and
hospital
aids
and
comforts
the
spirit
of
her
thought
and
intelligence
the
individuality
and
cleverness
of
all
her
methods
brought
her
so
vividly
before
him
that
it
was
almost
as
if
she
walked
by
his
side
as
if
they
spoke
together
as
if
she
said
i
have
tried
to
think
of
everything
i
want
you
to
miss
nothing
have
i
helped
you
tell
me
if
there
is
anything
the
thing
which
moved
and
stirred
him
was
his
knowledge
that
when
he
had
thought
of
her
she
had
also
been
thinking
of
him
or
of
what
deeply
concerned
him
when
he
had
said
to
himself
tossing
on
his
pillow
what
would
she
do
she
had
been
planning
in
such
a
way
as
answered
his
question
each
morning
when
the
supplies
arrived
it
was
as
if
he
had
received
a
message
from
her
as
the
people
in
the
cottages
felt
the
power
of
his
temperament
and
depended
upon
him
so
also
did
the
patients
in
the
ballroom
ward
the
feeling
had
existed
from
the
outset
and
increased
daily
the
doctors
and
nurses
told
one
another
that
his
passing
through
the
room
was
like
the
administering
of
a
tonic
patients
who
were
weak
and
making
no
effort
were
lifted
upon
the
strong
wave
of
his
will
and
carried
onward
towards
the
shore
of
greater
courage
and
strength
young
doctor
thwaite
met
him
when
he
came
in
one
morning
and
spoke
in
a
low
voice
there
is
a
young
man
behind
the
screen
there
who
is
very
low
he
said
he
had
an
internal
haemorrhage
towards
morning
and
has
lost
his
pluck
he
has
a
wife
and
three
children
we
have
been
doing
our
best
for
him
with
bottles
and
stimulants
but
he
has
not
the
courage
to
help
us
you
have
an
extraordinary
effect
on
them
all
lord
mount
dunstan
when
they
are
depressed
they
always
ask
when
you
are
coming
in
and
this
man
patton
his
name
is
has
asked
for
you
several
times
upon
my
word
i
believe
you
might
set
him
going
mount
dunstan
walked
to
the
bed
and
going
behind
the
screen
stood
looking
down
at
the
young
fellow
lying
breathing
pantingly
his
eyes
were
closed
as
he
laboured
and
his
pinched
white
nostrils
drew
themselves
in
and
puffed
out
at
each
breath
a
nurse
on
the
other
side
of
the
cot
had
just
surrounded
him
with
fresh
bottles
suddenly
the
sunken
eyelids
flew
open
and
the
eyes
met
mount
in
imploring
anxiousness
here
i
am
patton
mount
dunstan
said
you
need
not
but
he
must
speak
here
was
the
strength
his
sinking
soul
had
longed
for
cruel
bad
goin
fast
m
lord
he
panted
mount
dunstan
made
a
sign
to
the
nurse
who
gave
him
a
chair
he
sat
down
close
to
the
bed
and
took
the
bloodless
hand
in
his
own
no
he
said
you
are
not
going
you
stay
here
i
will
see
to
the
poor
fellow
smiled
wanly
vague
yearnings
had
led

did
not

the

of

by
that

the

was
over
he
had
acted
throughout
the
hours
under
the
direction
of
nurse

no

himself
had
touched
the

when
patton
eyes
were

they
rested
on
him
with
a
weird
growing
belief
he
begged
his
lordship

cried
out
for
him
he
found
himself
doing
hard
work
but
he
did
not
flinch
from
it
the
adoration
for
him
became
a
sort
of
passion
haggard
faces
lighted
up
into
life
at
the
sound
of
his
footstep
and
heavy
heads
turned
longingly
on
their
pillows
as
he
passed
by
in
the
winter
days
to
come
there
would
be
many
an
hour
talk
in
east
end
courts
and
alleys
of
the
queer
time
when
a
score
or
more
of
them
had
lain
in
the
great
room
with
the
dancing
and
floating
goddesses
looking
down
at
them
from
the
high
painted
ceiling
and
the
swell
who
was
a
lord
walking
about
among
them
working
for
them
as
the
nurses
did
and
sitting
by
some
of
them
through
awful
hours
sometimes
holding
burning
or
slackening
and
chilling
hands
with
a
grip
whose
steadiness
seemed
to
hold
them
back
from
the
brink
of
the
abyss
they
were
slipping
into
the
mere
ignorantly
childish
desire
to
do
his
prowess
credit
and
to
play
him
fair
saved
more
than
one
man
and
woman
from
going
out
with
the
tide
it
is
the
first
time
in
my
life
that
i
have
fairly
counted
among
men
it
the
first
time
i
have
known
human
affection
other
than
yours
penzance
they
want
me
these
people
they
are
better
for
the
sight
of
me
it
is
a
new
experience
and
it
is
good
for
a
man
soul
he
said
chapter
xliii
his
chance
betty
walked
much
alone
upon
the
marshes
with
roland
at
her
side
at
intervals
she
heard
from
penzance
but
his
notes
were
necessarily
brief
and
at
other
times
she
could
only
rely
upon
report
for
news
of
what
was
occurring
at
mount
dunstan
lord
mount
dunstan
almost
military
supervision
of
and
command
over
his
villagers
had
certainly
saved
them
from
the
horrors
of
an
uncontrollable
epidemic
his
decision
and
energy
had
filled
the
alarmed
guardians
with
respect
and
this
respect
had
begun
to
be
shared
by
many
other
persons
a
man
as
prompt
in
action
and
as
faithful
to
such
responsibilities
as
many
men
might
have
found
plausible
reasons
enough
for
shirking
inevitably
assumed
a
certain
dignity
of
aspect
when
all
was
said
and
done
lord
dunholm
was
most
clear
in
his
expressions
of
opinion
concerning
him
lady
alanby
of
dole
made
a
practice
of
speaking
of
him
in
public
frequently
always
with
admiring
approval
and
in
that
final
manner
of
hers
to
whose
authority
her
neighbours
had
so
long
submitted
it
began
to
be
accepted
as
a
fact
that
he
was
a
new
development
of
his
race
as
her
ladyship
had
put
it
a
new
order
of
mount
the
story
of
his
power
over
the
stricken
people
and
of
their
passionate
affection
and
admiration
for
him
was
one
likely
to
spread
far
and
be
immensely
popular
the
drama
of
certain
incidents
appealed
greatly
to
the
rustic
mind
and
by
cottage
firesides
he
was
represented
with
rapturous
awe
as
raising
men
women
and
children
from
the
dead
by
the
mere
miracle
of
touch
welden
and
old
doby
revelled
in
thrilling
almost
biblical
versions
of
current
anecdotes
when
betty
paid
her
visits
to
them
it
like
the
scripture
wot
he
done
for
that
young
man
as
the
last
breath
had
gone
out
of
him
an
him
lyin
stiffening
fast
man
arise
he
says
lord
almighty
calls
you
got
a
young
wife
three
children
to
take
care
of
take
up
your
bed
an
walk
not
as
he
wanted
him
to
carry
his
bed
anywheres
but
it
was
a
manner
of
speaking
an
up
the
young
man
got
an
a
sensible
way
said
old
welden
frankly
for
the
lord
to
look
at
it
for

must
say
miss
if
i
was
struck
down
for
it
though
i
it
only
my
sinful
ignorance
that
there
times
when
the
lord
seems
to
think
no
more
of
sweepin
away
a
steady
a
week
and
seven
in
family
an
one
at
the
breast
an
another

but
likely
enough
eighteen

a

does
seem
paltry
to
the
maker
of
an
but
to
the
girl
walking
over
the
marshland
the
humanness
of
the
things
she
heard
gave
to
her
the
sense
of
nearness
of
being
almost
within
sight
and
sound
which
mount
dunstan
himself
had
felt
when
each
day
was
filled
with
the
result
of
her
thought
of
the
needs
of
the
poor
souls
thrown
by
fate
into
his
hands
in
these
days
after
listening
to
old
welden
anecdotes
through
which
she
gathered
the
simpler
truth
of
things
betty
was
able
to
construct
for
herself
a
less
scriptural
version
of
what
she
had
heard
she
was
glad
glad
in
his
sitting
by
a
bedside
and
holding
a
hand
which
lay
in
his
hot
or
cold
but
always
trusting
to
something
which
his
strong
body
and
strong
soul
gave
without
stint
there
would
be
no
restraint
there
yes
he
was
kind
kind
kind
with
the
kindness
a
woman
loves
and
which
she
of
all
women
loved
most
sometimes
she
would
sit
upon
some
mound
and
while
her
eyes
seemed
to
rest
on
the
yellowing
marsh
and
its
birds
and
pools
they
saw
other
things
and
their
colour
grew
deep
and
dark
as
the
marsh
water
between
the
rushes
the
time
was
pressing
when
a
change
in
her
life
must
come
she
frequently
asked
herself
if
what
she
saw
in
nigel
anstruthers
face
was
the
normal
thinking
of
a
sane
man
which
he
himself
could
control
there
had
been
moments
when
she
had
seriously
doubted
it
he
was
haggard
aging
and
restless
sometimes
he
always
as
if
by
chance
followed
her
as
she
went
from
one
room
to
another
and
would
seat
himself
and
fix
his
miserable
eyes
upon
her
for
so
long
a
time
that
it
seemed
he
must
be
unconscious
of
what
he
was
doing
then
he
would
appear
suddenly
to
recollect
himself
and
would
start
up
with
a
muttered
exclamation
and
stalk
out
of
the
room
he
spent
long
hours
riding
or
driving
alone
about
the
country
or
wandering
wretchedly
through
the
park
and
gardens
once
he
went
up
to
town
and
after
a
few
days
absence
came
back
looking
more
haggard
than
before
and
wearing
a
hunted
look
in
his
eyes
he
had
gone
to
see
a
physician
and
after
having
seen
him
he
had
tried
to
lose
himself
in
a
plunge
into
deep
and
turbid
enough
waters
but
he
found
that
he
had
even
lost
the
taste
of
high
flavours
for
which
he
had
once
had
an
epicurean
palate
the
effort
had
ended
in
his
being
overpowered
again
by
his
horrors
the
horrors
in
which
he
found
himself
staring
at
that
end
of
things
when
no
pleasure
had
spice
no
debauchery
the
sting
of
life
and
men
such
as
he
stood
upon
the
shore
of
time
shuddering
and
naked
souls
watching
the
great
tide
bearing
its
treasures
recede
forever
and
leave
them
to
the
cold
and
hideous
dark
during
one
day
of
his
stay
in
town
he
had
seen
teresita
who
had
at
first
stared
half
frightened
by
the
change
she
saw
in
him
and
then
had
told
him
truths
he
could
have
wrung
her
neck
for
putting
into
words
you
look
an
old
man
she
said
with
the
foreign
accent
he
had
once
found
deliciously
amusing
but
which
now
seemed
to
add
a
sting
and
somesing
is
eating
you
op
you
are
mad
in
lofe
with
some
beautiful
one
who
will
not
look
at
you
i
haf
seen
it
in
mans
before
it
is
she
who
eats
you
op
your
evil
thinkings
of
her
it
serve
you
right
your
eyes
look
he
himself
at
times
suspected
that
they
did
and
cursed
himself
because
he
could
not
keep
cool
it
was
part
of
his
horrors
that
he
knew
his
internal
furies
were
worse
than
folly
and
yet
he
could
not
restrain
them
the
creeping
suspicion
that
this
was
only
the
result
of
the
simple
fact
that
he
had
never
tried
to
restrain
any
tendency
of
his
own
was
maddening
his
nervous
system
was
a
wreck
he
drank
a
great
deal
of
whisky
to
keep
himself
straight
during
the
day
and
he
rose
many
times
during
his
black
waking
hours
in
the
night
to
drink
more
because
he
obstinately
refused
to
give
up
the
hope
that
if
he
drank
enough
it
would
make
him
sleep
as
through
the
thoughts
of
mount
dunstan
who
was
a
clean
and
healthy
human
being
there
ran
one
thread
which
would
not
disentangle
itself
so
there
ran
through
his
unwholesome
thinking
a
thread
which
burned
like
fire
his
secret
ravings
would
not
have
been
good
to
hear
his
passion
was
more
than
half
hatred
and
a
desire
for
vengeance
for
the
chance
to
his
own
power
to
prove
himself
master
to
get
the
better
in
one
way
or
another
of
this
arrogant
young
outsider
and
her
pride
the
condition
of
his
mind
was
so
far
from
normal
that
he
failed
to
see
that
the
things
he
said
to
himself
the
plans
he
laid
were
grotesque
in
their
folly
the
old
cruel
dominance
of
the
man
over
the
woman
thing
which
had
seemed
the
mere
natural
working
of
the
law
among
men
of
his
race
in
centuries
past
was
awake
in
him
amid
the
limitations
of
modern
days
my
god
he
said
to
himself
more
than
once
i
would
like
to
have
had
her
in
my
hands
a
few
hundred
years
ago
women
were
kept
in
their
places
he
was
even
frenzied
enough
to
think
over
what
he
would
have
done
if
such
a
thing
had
been
of
her
utter
helplessness
against
that
which
raged
in
him
of
the
grey
thickness
of
the
walls
where
he
might
have
held
and
wrought
his
will
upon
her
insult
torment
death
his
brain
ran
riot
but
when
it
did
its
foolish
worst
he
was
baffled
by
one
thing
damn
her
he
found
himself
crying
out
if
i
had
hung
her
up
and
cut
her
into
strips
she
would
have
died
staring
at
me
with
her
big
eyes
without
uttering
a
there
was
a
long
reach
between
his
imaginings
and
the
time
he
lived
in
america
had
not
been
discovered
in
those
decent
days
and
now
a
man
could
not
beat
even
his
own
wife
or
spend
her
money
without
being
meddled
with
by
fools
he
was
thinking
of
a
new
york
young
woman
of
the
nineteenth
century
who
could
actually
do
as
she
hanged
pleased
and
who
pleased
to
be
damned
high
and
mighty
for
that
reason
in
itself
it
was
incumbent
upon
a
man
to
get
even
with
her
in
one
way
or
another
high
and
mightiness
was
not
the
hardest
thing
to
reach
it
offered
a
good
aim
his
temper
when
he
returned
to
stornham
was
of
the
order
which
in
past
years
had
set
rosalie
and
her
child
shuddering
and
had
sent
the
servants
about
the
house
with
pale
or
sullen
faces
betty
presence
had
the
odd
effect
of
restraining
him
and
he
even
told
her
so
with
sneering
resentment
there
would
be
the
devil
to
pay
if
you
were
not
here
he
said
you
keep
me
in
order
by
jove
i
ca
work
up
steam
properly
when
you
watch
he
himself
knew
that
it
was
likely
that
some
change
would
take
place
she
would
not
stay
at
stornham
and
she
would
not
leave
his
wife
and
child
alone
with
him
again
it
would
be
like
her
to
hold
her
tongue
until
she
was
ready
with
her
infernal
plans
and
could
spring
them
on
him
her
letters
to
her
father
had
probably
prepared
him
for
such
action
as
such
a
man
would
be
likely
to
take
he
could
guess
what
it
would
be
they
were
free
and
easy
enough
in
america
in
their
dealings
with
the
marriage
tie
their
idea
would
doubtless
be
a
divorce
with
custody
of
the
child
he
wondered
a
little
that
they
had
remained
quiet
so
long
there
had
been
american
shrewdness
in
her
coming
boldly
to
stornham
to
look
over
the
ground
herself
and
actually
set
the
place
in
order
it
did
not
present
itself
to
his
mind
that
what
she
had
done
had
been
no
part
of
a
scheme
but
the
mere
result
of
her
temperament
and
training
he
told
himself
that
it
had
been
planned
beforehand
and
carried
out
in
commercial
american
fashion
as
a
matter
of
business
the
thing
which
most
enraged
him
was
the
implied
cool
practical
realisation
of
the
fact
that
he
as
inheritor
of
an
entailed
estate
was
but
owner
in
charge
and
not
young
enough
to
be
regarded
as
an
insurmountable
obstacle
to
their
plans
he
could
not
undo
the
greater
part
of
what
had
been
done
and
they
were
calculating
he
argued
that
his
would
not
be
likely
to
be
a
long
life
and
if
if
anything
happened
stornham
would
be
ughtred
and
the
whole
vulgar
lot
of
them
would
come
over
and
take
possession
and
swagger
about
the
place
as
if
they
had
been
born
on
it
as
to
divorce
or
separation
if
they
took
that
line
he
would
at
least
give
them
a
good
run
for
their
money
they
would
wish
they
had
let
sleeping
dogs
lie
before
the
thing
was
over
the
right
kind
of
lawyer
could
bully
rosalie
into
saying
anything
he
chose
on
the
there
was
not
much
limit
to
the
evidence
a
man
could
bring
if
he
was
experienced
enough
to
be
circumstantial
and
knew
whom
he
was
dealing
with
the
very
fact
that
the
little
fool
could
be
made
to
appear
to
have
been
so
sly
and
sanctimonious
would
stir
the
gall
of
any
jury
of
men
his
own
condoning
the
matter
for
the
sake
of
his
sensitive
boy
deformed
by
his
mother
unrestrained
and
violent
hysteria
before
his
birth
would
go
a
long
way
let
them
get
their
divorce
they
would
have
paid
for
it
the
whole
lot
of
them
the
beautiful
miss
vanderpoel
and
all
such
a
story
as
the
newspapers
would
revel
in
would
not
be
a
recommendation
to
englishmen
of
unsmirched
reputation
then
his
exultation
would
suddenly
drop
as
his
mental
excitement
produced
its
effect
of
inevitable
physical
fatigue
even
if
he
made
them
pay
for
getting
their
own
way
what
would
happen
to
himself
afterwards
no
morbid
vanity
of
could
make
the
outlook
anything
but
unpromising
if
he
had
not
had
such
diabolical
luck
in
his
few
investments
he
could
have
lived
his
own
life
as
it
was
old
vanderpoel
would
possibly
condescend
to
make
him
some
insufficient
allowance
because
rosalie
would
wish
that
it
might
be
done
and
he
would
be
expected
to
drag
out
to
the
end
the
kind
of
life
a
man
pensioned
by
his
wife
relatives
inevitably
does
if
he
attempted
to
live
in
the
country
he
should
blow
out
his
brains
when
his
depression
was
at
its
worst
he
saw
himself
aging
and
shabby
rambling
about
from
one
cheap
continental
town
to
another
blackballed
by
good
clubs
even
by
the
teresitas
cut
off
from
society
by
his
limited
means
and
the
stories
his
wife
friends
would
spread
he
ground
his
teeth
when
he
thought
of
betty
her
splendid
vitality
had
done
something
to
life
for
him
had
given
it
savour
when
he
had
come
upon
her
in
the
avenue
his
blood
had
stirred
even
though
it
had
been
maliciously
and
there
had
been
spice
in
his
very
resentment
of
her
presence
and
she
would
go
away
he
would
not
be
likely
to
see
her
again
if
his
wife
broke
with
him
she
would
be
swept
out
of
his
days
it
was
hideous
to
think
of
and
his
rage
would
overpower
him
and
his
nerves
go
to
pieces
again
what
are
you
going
to
do
he
broke
forth
suddenly
one
evening
when
he
found
himself
temporarily
alone
with
her
you
are
going
to
do
something
i
see
it
in
your
he
had
been
for
some
time
watching
her
from
behind
his
newspaper
while
she
with
an
unread
book
upon
her
lap
had
in
fact
been
thinking
deeply
and
putting
to
herself
serious
questions
her
answer
made
him
stir
rather
uncomfortably
i
am
going
to
write
to
my
father
to
ask
him
to
come
to
so
this
was
what
she
had
been
preparing
to
spring
upon
him
he
laughed
insolently
to
ask
him
to
come
here
with
your
with
mine
does
an
american
wait
for
permission
is
there
any
practical
reason
why
you
should
prefer
that
he
should
not
come
he
left
his
seat
and
walked
over
to
her
yes
your
sending
for
him
is
a
declaration
of
it
need
not
be
so
why
should
it
in
this
case
i
happen
to
be
aware
that
it
is
the
choice
is
your
own
i
suppose
with
ready
bravado
that
you
and
he
are
prepared
to
face
the
consequences
but
is
rosalie
and
is
your
mother
my
father
is
a
business
man
and
will
know
what
can
be
done
he
will
know
what
is
worth
doing
she
answered
without
noticing
his
question
but
she
added
the
words
slowly
i
have
been
making
up
my
mind
before
i
write
to
him
to
say
something
to
you
to
ask
you
a
he
made
a
mock
sentimental
gesture
to
ask
me
to
spare
my
wife
to
that
she
is
the
mother
of
my
child
she
passed
over
that
also
to
ask
you
if
there
is
no
possible
way
in
which
all
this
unhappiness
can
be
ended
the
only
decent
way
of
ending
it
would
be
that
there
should
be
no
further
interference
let
rosalie
supply
the
decency
by
showing
me
the
consideration
due
from
a
wife
to
her
husband
the
place
has
been
put
in
order
it
was
not
for
my
benefit
and
i
have
no
money
to
keep
it
up
let
rosalie
be
provided
with
means
to
do
as
he
spoke
the
words
he
realised
that
he
had
opened
a
way
for
embarrassing
comment
he
expected
her
to
remind
him
that
rosalie
had
not
come
to
him
without
money
but
she
said
nothing
about
the
matter
she
never
said
the
things
he
expected
to
hear
you
do
not
want
rosalie
for
your
wife
she
went
on
but
you
could
treat
her
courteously
without
loving
her
you
could
allow
her
the
privileges
other
men
wives
are
allowed
you
need
not
separate
her
from
her
family
you
could
allow
her
father
and
mother
to
come
to
her
and
leave
her
free
to
go
to
them
sometimes
will
you
not
agree
to
that
will
you
not
let
her
live
peaceably
in
her
own
simple
way
she
is
very
gentle
and
humble
and
would
ask
nothing
she
is
a
fool
he
exclaimed
furiously
a
fool
she
will
stay
where
she
is
and
do
as
i
tell
you
knew
what
she
was
when
you
married
her
she
was
simple
and
girlish
and
pretended
to
be
nothing
she
was
not
you
chose
to
marry
her
and
take
her
from
the
people
who
loved
her
you
broke
her
spirit
and
her
heart
you
would
have
killed
her
if
i
had
not
come
in
time
to
prevent
i
will
kill
her
yet
if
you
leave
her
his
folly
made
him
say
you
are
talking
like
a
feudal
lord
holding
the
power
of
life
and
death
in
his
hands
she
said
power
like
that
is
ancient
history
you
can
hurt
no
one
who
has
friends
without
being
it
was
the
old
story
she
filled
him
with
the
desire
to
shake
or
disturb
her
at
any
cost
and
he
did
his
utmost
if
she
was
proposing
to
make
terms
with
him
he
would
show
her
whether
he
would
accept
them
or
not
he
let
her
hear
all
he
had
said
to
himself
in
his
worst
moments
all
that
he
had
argued
concerning
what
she
and
her
people
would
do
and
what
his
own
actions
would
be
all
his
intention
to
make
them
pay
the
uttermost
farthing
in
humiliation
if
he
could
not
frustrate
them
his
methods
would
be
definite
enough
he
had
not
watched
his
wife
and
ffolliott
for
weeks
to
no
end
he
had
known
what
he
was
dealing
with
he
had
put
other
people
upon
the
track
and
they
would
testify
for
him
he
poured
forth
unspeakable
statements
and
intimations
going
as
usual
further
than
he
had
known
he
should
go
when
he
began
under
the
spur
of
excitement
his
imagination
served
him
well
at
last
he
paused
well
he
put
it
to
her
what
have
you
to
say
i
with
the
remote
intent
curiosity
growing
in
her
eyes
i
have
nothing
to
say
i
am
leaving
you
to
say
you
will
of
course
try
to
deny
he
insisted
no
i
shall
not
why
should
i
you
may
assume
your
air
of
magnificence
but
i
am
dealing
with
uncomfortable
he
stopped
in
spite
of
himself
and
then
burst
forth
in
a
new
order
of
rage
you
are
trying
some
confounded
experiment
on
me
what
is
it
she
rose
from
her
chair
to
go
out
of
the
room
and
stood
a
moment
holding
her
book
half
open
in
her
hand
yes
i
suppose
it
might
be
called
an
experiment
was
her
answer
perhaps
it
was
a
mistake
i
wanted
to
make
quite
sure
of
of
what
i
did
not
want
to
leave
anything
undone
i
did
not
want
to
believe
that
any
man
could
exist
who
had
not
one
touch
of
decent
feeling
to
redeem
him
it
did
not
seem
white
dints
showed
themselves
about
his
nostrils
well
you
have
found
one
he
cried
you
have
a
lashing
tongue
by
god
when
you
choose
to
let
it
go
but
i
could
teach
you
a
good
many
things
my
girl
and
before
i
have
done
you
will
have
learned
most
of
but
though
he
threw
himself
into
a
chair
and
laughed
aloud
as
she
left
him
he
knew
that
his
arrogance
and
bullying
were
proving
poor
weapons
though
they
had
done
him
good
service
all
his
life
and
he
knew
too
that
it
was
mere
simple
truth
that
as
a
result
of
the
intellectual
ethical
vagaries
he
scathingly
derided
she
had
actually
been
giving
him
a
sort
of
chance
to
retrieve
himself
and
that
if
he
had
been
another
sort
of
man
he
might
have
taken
it
chapter
xliv
a
footstep
it
was
cold
enough
for
fires
in
halls
and
bedrooms
and
lady
anstruthers
often
sat
over
hers
and
watched
the
glowing
bed
of
coals
with
a
fixed
thoughtfulness
of
look
she
was
so
sitting
when
her
sister
went
to
her
room
to
talk
to
her
and
she
looked
up
questioningly
when
the
door
closed
and
betty
came
towards
her
you
have
come
to
tell
me
something
she
said
a
slight
shade
of
anxiousness
showed
itself
in
her
eyes
and
betty
sat
down
by
her
and
took
her
hand
she
had
come
because
what
she
knew
was
that
rosalie
must
be
prepared
for
any
step
taken
and
the
time
had
arrived
when
she
must
not
be
allowed
to
remain
in
ignorance
even
of
things
it
would
be
unpleasant
to
put
into
words
yes
she
answered
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
something
i
have
decided
to
do
i
think
i
must
write
to
father
and
ask
him
to
come
to
rosalie
turned
white
but
though
her
lips
parted
as
if
she
were
going
to
speak
she
said
nothing
do
not
be
frightened
betty
said
i
believe
it
is
the
only
thing
to
i
know
i
know
betty
went
on
holding
the
hand
a
little
closer
when
i
came
here
you
were
too
weak
physically
to
be
able
to
face
even
the
thought
of
a
struggle
i
saw
that
i
was
afraid
it
must
come
in
the
end
but
i
knew
that
at
that
time
you
could
not
bear
it
it
would
have
killed
you
and
might
have
killed
mother
if
i
had
not
waited
and
until
you
were
stronger
i
knew
i
must
wait
and
reason
coolly
about
you
about
i
used
to
guess
sometimes
said
lady
anstruthers
i
can
tell
you
about
it
now
you
are
not
as
you
were
then
betty
said
i
did
not
know
nigel
at
first
and
i
felt
i
ought
to
see
more
of
him
i
wanted
to
make
sure
that
my
child
hatred
of
him
did
not
make
me
unfair
i
even
tried
to
hope
that
when
he
came
back
and
found
the
place
in
order
and
things
going
well
he
might
recognise
the
wisdom
of
behaving
with
decent
kindness
to
you
if
he
had
done
that
i
knew
father
would
have
provided
for
you
both
though
he
would
not
have
left
him
the
opportunity
to
do
again
what
he
did
before
no
business
man
would
allow
such
a
thing
as
that
but
as
time
has
gone
by
i
have
seen
i
was
mistaken
in
hoping
for
a
respectable
compromise
even
if
he
were
given
a
free
hand
he
would
not
change
and
now
she
hesitated
feeling
it
difficult
to
choose
such
words
as
would
not
be
too
unpleasant
how
was
she
to
tell
rosy
of
the
ugly
morbid
situation
which
made
ordinary
passiveness
impossible
now
there
is
a
reason
she
began
again
to
her
surprise
and
relief
it
was
rosalie
who
ended
for
her
she
spoke
with
the
painful
courage
which
strong
affection
gives
a
weak
thing
her
face
was
pale
no
longer
but
slightly
reddened
and
she
lifted
the
hand
which
held
hers
and
kissed
it
you
shall
not
say
it
she
interrupted
her
i
will
there
is
a
reason
now
why
you
can
not
stay
here
why
you
shall
not
stay
here
that
was
why
i
begged
you
to
go
you
must
go
even
if
i
stay
behind
never
had
the
beautiful
miss
vanderpoel
eyes
worn
so
fully
their
look
of
being
bluebells
under
water
that
this
timid
creature
should
so
stand
at
bay
to
defend
her
was
more
moving
than
anything
else
could
have
been
thank
you
rosy
thank
you
she
answered
but
you
shall
not
be
left
alone
you
must
go
too
there
is
no
other
way
difficulties
will
be
made
for
us
but
we
must
face
them
father
will
see
the
situation
from
a
practical
man
standpoint
men
know
the
things
other
men
can
not
do
women
do
generally
they
know
nothing
about
the
law
and
can
be
bullied
into
feeling
that
it
is
dangerous
and
compromising
to
inquire
into
it
nigel
has
always
seen
that
it
was
easy
to
manage
women
a
strong
business
man
who
has
more
exact
legal
information
than
he
has
himself
will
be
a
new
factor
to
deal
with
and
he
can
not
make
objectionable
love
to
him
it
is
because
he
knows
these
things
that
he
says
that
my
sending
for
father
will
be
a
declaration
of
did
he
say
that
a
little
breathlessly
yes
and
i
told
him
that
it
need
not
be
so
but
he
would
not
and
you
are
sure
father
will
come
i
am
sure
in
a
week
or
two
he
will
be
lady
anstruthers
lips
shook
her
eyes
lifted
themselves
to
betty
in
a
touchingly
distressed
appeal
had
her
momentary
courage
fled
beyond
recall
if
so
that
would
be
the
worst
coming
to
the
worst
indeed
yet
it
was
not
ordinary
fear
which
expressed
itself
in
her
face
but
a
deeper
piteousness
a
sudden
hopeless
pain
baffling
because
it
seemed
a
new
emotion
or
perhaps
the
upheaval
of
an
old
one
long
and
carefully
hidden
you
will
be
brave
betty
appealed
to
her
you
will
not
give
way
rosy
yes
i
must
be
brave
i
am
not
ill
now
i
must
not
fail
you
i
wo
betty
but
she
slipped
upon
the
floor
and
dropped
her
face
upon
the
girl
knee
sobbing
betty
bent
over
her
putting
her
arms
round
the
heaving
shoulders
and
pleading
with
her
to
speak
was
there
something
more
to
be
told
something
she
did
not
know
yes
yes
oh
i
ought
to
have
told
you
long
ago
but
i
have
always
been
afraid
and
ashamed
it
has
made
everything
so
much
worse
i
was
afraid
you
would
not
understand
and
would
think
me
wicked
it
was
betty
who
now
lost
a
shade
of
colour
but
she
held
the
slim
little
body
closer
and
kissed
her
sister
cheek
what
have
you
been
afraid
and
ashamed
to
tell
me
do
not
be
ashamed
any
more
you
must
not
hide
anything
no
matter
what
it
is
rosy
i
shall
i
know
i
must
not
hide
anything
now
that
all
is
over
and
father
is
coming
it
is
it
is
about
mr
ffolliott
repeated
betty
quite
softly
lady
anstruthers
face
lifted
with
desperate
effort
was
like
a
weeping
child
so
much
so
in
its
simpleness
and
utter
lack
of
any
effort
at
concealment
that
after
one
quick
look
at
it
betty
hastened
pulses
ceased
to
beat
at
time
tell
me
dear
she
almost
whispered
mr
ffolliott
himself
does
not
know
and
i
could
not
help
it
he
was
kind
to
me
when
i
was
dying
of
unkindness
you
do
know
what
it
was
like
to
be
drowning
in
loneliness
and
misery
and
to
see
one
good
hand
stretched
out
to
help
you
before
he
went
away
oh
betty
i
know
it
was
awful
because
i
was
married
i
began
to
care
for
him
very
much
and
i
have
cared
for
him
ever
since
i
can
not
stop
myself
caring
even
though
i
am
betty
kissed
her
again
with
a
passion
of
tender
pity
poor
little
simple
rosy
too
the
tide
had
crept
around
her
also
and
had
swept
her
off
her
feet
tossing
her
upon
its
surf
like
a
wisp
of
seaweed
and
bearing
her
each
day
farther
from
firm
shore
do
not
be
terrified
she
said
you
need
only
be
afraid
if
if
you
had
told
he
will
never
know
never
once
in
the
middle
of
the
night
there
was
anguish
in
the
delicate
face
pure
anguish
a
strange
loud
cry
wakened
me
and
it
was
i
myself
who
had
cried
out
because
in
my
sleep
it
had
come
home
to
me
that
the
years
would
go
on
and
on
and
at
last
some
day
he
would
die
and
go
out
of
the
world
and
i
should
die
and
go
out
of
the
world
and
he
would
never
know
even
betty
clasp
of
her
loosened
and
she
sat
very
still
looking
straight
before
her
into
some
unseen
place
yes
she
said
involuntarily
yes
know
i
know
i
lady
anstruthers
fell
back
a
little
to
gaze
at
her
you
know
you
know
she
breathed
betty
but
betty
at
first
did
not
speak
her
lovely
eyes
dwelt
on
the
place
betty
whispered
rosy
do
you
know
what
you
have
said
the
lovely
eyes
turned
slowly
towards
her
and
the
soft
corners
of
betty
mouth
deepened
in
a
curious
unsteadiness
yes
i
did
not
intend
to
say
it
but
it
is
true
know
i
know
i
know
do
not
ask
me
rosalie
flung
her
arms
round
her
waist
and
for
a
moment
hid
her
face
you
you
she
murmured
but
stopped
herself
almost
as
she
uttered
the
exclamation
i
will
not
ask
you
she
said
when
she
spoke
again
but
now
i
shall
not
be
so
ashamed
you
are
a
beauty
and
wonderful
and
i
am
not
but
if
you
know
that
makes
us
almost
the
same
you
will
understand
why
i
broke
down
it
was
because
i
could
not
bear
to
think
of
what
will
happen
i
shall
be
saved
and
taken
home
but
nigel
will
wreak
revenge
on
him
and
i
shall
be
the
shame
that
is
put
upon
him
only
because
he
was
kind
kind
when
father
comes
it
will
all
she
wrung
her
hands
becoming
almost
hysterical
hush
said
betty
hush
a
man
like
that
can
not
be
hurt
even
by
a
man
like
nigel
there
is
a
way
out
there
is
oh
rosy
we
must
believe
she
soothed
and
caressed
her
and
led
her
on
to
relieving
her
long
misery
by
speech
it
was
easy
to
see
the
ways
in
which
her
feeling
had
made
her
life
harder
to
bear
she
was
as
inexperienced
as
a
girl
and
had
accused
herself
cruelly
when
nigel
had
tormented
her
with
evil
carefully
chosen
taunts
she
had
felt
half
guilty
and
had
coloured
scarlet
or
turned
pale
afraid
to
meet
his
sneeringly
smiling
face
she
had
tried
to
forget
the
kind
voice
the
kindly
understanding
eyes
and
had
blamed
herself
as
a
criminal
because
she
could
not
i
had
nothing
else
to
remember
but
unhappiness
and
it
seemed
as
if
i
could
not
help
but
remember
him
she
said
as
simply
as
the
rosy
who
had
left
new
york
at
nineteen
might
have
said
it
i
was
afraid
to
trust
myself
to
speak
his
name
when
nigel
made
insulting
speeches
i
could
not
answer
him
and
he
used
to
say
that
women
who
had
adventures
should
train
their
faces
not
to
betray
them
every
time
they
were
looked
at
oh
broke
from
betty
lips
and
she
stood
up
on
the
hearth
and
threw
out
her
hands
i
wish
that
for
one
day
i
might
be
a
man
and
your
brother
instead
of
your
sister
why
betty
smiled
strangely
a
smile
which
was
not
amused
which
was
perhaps
not
a
smile
at
all
her
voice
as
she
answered
was
at
once
low
and
tense
because
then
i
should
know
what
to
do
when
a
male
creature
can
not
be
reached
through
manhood
or
decency
or
shame
there
is
one
way
in
which
he
can
be
punished
a
man
a
real
man
should
take
him
by
his
throat
and
lash
him
with
a
whip
while
others
look
on
lash
him
until
he
howls
aloud
like
a
she
had
not
expected
to
say
it
but
she
had
said
it
lady
anstruthers
looked
at
her
fascinated
and
then
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
huddling
herself
in
a
heap
as
she
knelt
on
the
rug
looking
singularly
small
and
frail
betty
she
said
presently
in
a
new
awful
little
voice
i
i
will
tell
you
something
i
never
thought
i
should
dare
to
tell
anyone
alive
i
have
shuddered
at
it
myself
there
have
been
days
awful
helpless
days
when
i
was
sure
there
was
no
hope
for
me
in
all
the
world
when
deep
down
in
my
soul
i
understood
what
women
felt
when
they
murdered
people
crept
to
them
in
their
wicked
sleep
and
struck
them
again
and
again
and
again
like
that
she
sat
up
suddenly
as
if
she
did
not
know
what
she
was
doing
and
uncovering
her
little
ghastly
face
struck
downward
three
fierce
times
at
nothingness
but
as
if
it
were
not
nothingness
and
as
if
she
held
something
in
her
hand
there
was
horror
in
it
betty
sprang
at
the
hand
and
caught
it
no
no
she
cried
out
poor
little
rosy
darling
little
rosy
no
no
no
that
instant
lady
anstruthers
looked
up
at
her
shocked
and
awake
she
was
rosy
again
and
clung
to
her
holding
to
her
dress
piteous
and
panting
no
no
she
said
when
it
came
to
me
in
the
night
it
was
always
in
the
night
i
used
to
get
out
of
bed
and
pray
that
it
might
never
never
come
again
and
that
i
might
be
forgiven
just
forgiven
it
was
too
horrible
that
i
should
even
understand
it
so
a
woeful
wry
little
smile
twisted
her
mouth
i
was
not
brave
enough
to
have
done
it
i
could
never
have
done
it
betty
but
the
thought
was
there
it
was
there
i
used
to
think
it
had
made
a
black
mark
on
my
the
letter
took
long
to
write
it
led
a
consecutive
story
up
to
the
point
where
it
culminated
in
a
situation
which
presented
itself
as
no
longer
to
be
dealt
with
by
means
at
hand
parts
of
the
story
previous
letters
had
related
though
some
of
them
it
had
not
seemed
absolutely
necessary
to
relate
in
detail
now
they
must
be
made
clear
and
betty
made
them
so
because
you
trusted
me
you
made
me
trust
myself
was
one
of
the
things
she
wrote
for
some
time
i
felt
that
it
was
best
to
fight
for
my
own
hand
without
troubling
you
i
hoped
perhaps
i
might
be
able
to
lead
things
to
a
decorous
sort
of
issue
i
saw
that
secretly
rosy
hoped
and
prayed
that
it
might
be
possible
she
gave
up
expecting
happiness
before
she
was
twenty
and
mere
decent
peace
would
have
seemed
heaven
to
her
if
she
could
have
been
allowed
sometimes
to
see
those
she
loved
and
longed
for
now
that
i
must
give
up
my
hope
which
was
perhaps
a
rather
foolish
one
and
now
that
i
can
not
remain
at
stornham
she
would
have
no
defence
at
all
if
she
were
left
alone
her
condition
would
be
more
hopeless
than
before
because
nigel
would
never
forget
that
we
had
tried
to
rescue
her
and
had
failed
if
i
were
a
man
or
if
i
were
very
much
older
i
need
not
be
actually
driven
away
but
as
it
is
i
think
that
you
must
come
and
take
the
matter
into
your
own
she
had
remained
in
her
sister
room
until
long
after
midnight
and
by
the
time
the
american
letter
was
completed
and
sealed
a
pale
touch
of
dawning
light
was
showing
itself
she
rose
and
going
to
the
window
drew
the
blind
up
and
looked
out
the
looking
out
made
her
open
the
window
and
when
she
had
done
so
she
stood
feeling
the
almost
unearthly
freshness
of
the
morning
about
her
the
mystery
of
the
first
faint
light
was
almost
unearthly
too
trees
and
shrubs
were
beginning
to
take
form
and
outline
themselves
against
the
still
pallor
of
the
dawn
before
long
the
waking
of
the
birds
would
begin
a
brief
chirping
note
here
and
there
breaking
the
silence
and
warning
the
world
with
faint
insistence
that
it
had
begun
to
live
again
and
must
bestir
itself
she
had
got
out
of
her
bed
sometimes
on
a
summer
morning
to
watch
the
beauty
of
it
to
see
the
flowers
gradually
reveal
their
colour
to
the
eye
to
hear
the
warmly
nesting
things
begin
their
joyous
day
there
were
fewer
bird
sounds
now
and
the
garden
beds
were
autumnal
but
how
beautiful
it
all
was
how
wonderful
life
in
such
a
place
might
be
if
flowers
and
birds
and
sweep
of
sward
and
mass
of
stately
trees
were
parts
of
the
home
one
loved
and
which
surely
would
in
its
own
way
love
one
in
return
but
soon
all
this
phase
of
life
would
be
over
rosalie
once
safe
at
home
would
look
back
remembering
the
place
with
a
shudder
as
ughtred
grew
older
the
passing
of
years
would
dim
miserable
child
memories
and
when
his
inheritance
fell
to
him
he
might
return
to
see
it
with
happier
eyes
she
began
to
picture
to
herself
rosy
voyage
in
the
ship
which
would
carry
her
across
the
atlantic
to
her
mother
and
the
scenes
connected
in
her
mind
only
with
a
girl
happiness
whatsoever
happened
before
it
took
place
the
voyage
would
be
made
in
the
end
and
rosalie
would
be
like
a
creature
in
a
dream
a
heavenly
unbelievable
dream
betty
could
imagine
how
she
would
look
wrapped
up
and
sitting
in
her
steamer
chair
gazing
out
with
rapturous
eyes
upon
the
racing
waves
she
will
be
happy
she
thought
but
i
shall
not
no
i
shall
she
drew
in
the
morning
air
and
unconsciously
turned
towards
the
place
where
across
the
rising
and
falling
lands
and
behind
the
trees
she
knew
the
great
white
house
stood
far
away
with
watchers
lights
showing
dimly
behind
the
line
of
ballroom
windows
i
do
not
know
how
such
a
thing
could
be
i
do
not
know
how
such
a
thing
could
be
she
said
it
could
and
she
lifted
a
high
head
not
even
asking
herself
what
remote
sense
in
her
being
so
obstinately
defied
and
threw
down
the
glove
to
fate
sounds
gain
a
curious
distinctness
and
meaning
in
the
hour
of
the
break
of
the
dawn
in
such
an
hour
they
seem
even
more
significant
than
sounds
heard
in
the
dead
of
night
when
she
had
gone
to
the
window
she
had
fancied
that
she
heard
something
in
the
corridor
outside
her
door
but
when
she
had
listened
there
had
been
only
silence
now
there
was
sound
again
that
of
a
softly
moved
slippered
foot
she
went
to
the
centre
and
waited
yes
certainly
something
had
stirred
in
the
passage
she
went
to
the
door
itself
the
dragging
step
had
hesitated
stopped
could
it
be
rosalie
who
had
come
to
her
for
something
for
one
second
her
impulse
was
to
open
the
door
herself
the
next
she
had
changed
her
mind
with
a
sense
of
shock
someone
had
actually
touched
the
handle
and
very
delicately
turned
it
it
was
not
pleasant
to
stand
looking
at
it
and
see
it
turn
she
heard
a
low
evidently
unintentionally
uttered
exclamation
and
she
turned
away
and
with
no
attempt
at
softening
the
sound
of
her
footsteps
walked
across
the
room
hot
with
passionate
disgust
as
well
as
if
she
had
flung
the
door
open
she
knew
who
stood
outside
it
was
nigel
anstruthers
haggard
and
unseemly
with
sleepless
eyes
and
bitten
lip
bad
and
mad
as
she
had
at
last
seen
the
situation
to
be
it
was
uglier
and
more
desperate
than
she
could
well
know
chapter
xlv
the
passing
bell
the
following
morning
sir
nigel
did
not
appear
at
the
breakfast
table
he
breakfasted
in
his
own
room
and
it
became
known
throughout
the
household
that
he
had
suddenly
decided
to
go
away
and
his
man
was
packing
for
the
journey
what
the
journey
or
the
reason
for
its
being
taken
happened
to
be
were
things
not
explained
to
anyone
but
lady
anstruthers
at
the
door
of
whose
dressing
room
he
appeared
without
warning
just
as
she
was
leaving
it
rosalie
started
when
she
found
herself
confronting
him
his
eyes
looked
hot
and
hollow
with
feverish
sleeplessness
you
look
ill
she
exclaimed
involuntarily
you
look
as
if
you
had
not
thank
you
you
always
encourage
a
man
i
am
not
in
the
habit
of
sleeping
much
he
answered
i
am
going
away
for
my
health
it
is
as
well
you
should
know
i
am
going
to
look
up
old
broadmorlands
i
want
to
know
exactly
where
he
is
in
case
it
becomes
necessary
for
me
to
see
him
i
also
require
some
trifling
data
connected
with
ffolliott
if
your
father
is
coming
it
will
be
as
well
to
be
able
to
lay
my
hands
on
things
you
can
explain
to
betty
he
waited
for
no
reply
but
wheeled
about
and
left
her
betty
herself
wore
a
changed
face
when
she
came
down
a
cloud
had
passed
over
her
blooming
as
clouds
pass
over
a
morning
sky
and
dim
it
rosalie
asked
herself
if
she
had
not
noticed
something
like
this
before
she
began
to
think
she
had
yes
she
was
sure
that
at
intervals
there
had
been
moments
when
she
had
glanced
at
the
brilliant
face
with
an
uneasy
and
yet
sense
of
looking
at
a
glowing
light
temporarily
waning
the
feeling
had
been
unrealisable
because
it
was
not
to
be
explained
betty
was
never
ill
she
was
never
she
was
never
out
of
humour
or
afraid
of
things
that
was
why
it
was
so
wonderful
to
live
with
her
but
yes
it
was
true
there
had
been
days
when
the
strong
fine
light
of
her
had
waned
lady
comprehension
of
it
arose
now
from
her
memory
of
the
look
she
had
seen
the
night
before
in
the
eyes
which
suddenly
had
gazed
straight
before
her
as
into
an
unknown
place
yes
i
know
i
know
i
know
and
the
tone
in
the
girl
voice
had
been
one
rosy
had
not
heard
before
slight
wonder
if
you
knew
at
any
outward
change
which
showed
itself
though
in
your
own
most
desperate
despite
it
would
be
so
even
with
betty
who
in
her
sister
eyes
was
unlike
any
other
creature
but
perhaps
it
would
be
better
to
make
no
comment
to
make
comment
would
be
almost
like
asking
the
question
she
had
been
forbidden
to
ask
while
the
servants
were
in
the
room
during
breakfast
they
talked
of
common
things
resorting
even
to
the
weather
and
the
news
of
the
village
afterwards
they
passed
into
the
morning
room
together
and
betty
put
her
arm
around
rosalie
and
kissed
her
nigel
has
suddenly
gone
away
i
hear
she
said
do
you
know
where
he
has
gone
he
came
to
my
to
tell
betty
felt
the
whole
slim
body
stiffen
itself
with
a
determination
to
seem
calm
he
said
he
was
going
to
find
out
where
the
old
duke
of
broadmorlands
was
staying
at
there
is
some
forethought
in
that
was
betty
answer
he
is
not
on
such
terms
with
the
duke
that
he
can
expect
to
be
received
as
a
casual
visitor
it
will
require
apt
contrivance
to
arrange
an
interview
i
wonder
if
he
will
be
able
to
accomplish
it
yes
he
will
said
lady
anstruthers
i
think
he
can
always
contrive
things
like
she
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
added
he
said
also
that
he
wished
to
find
out
certain
things
about
ffolliott
data
he
called
it
that
he
might
be
able
to
lay
his
hands
on
things
if
father
came
he
told
me
to
explain
to
that
was
intended
for
a
taunt
but
it
a
warning
betty
said
thinking
the
thing
over
we
are
rather
like
ladies
left
alone
to
defend
a
besieged
castle
he
wished
us
to
feel
she
tightened
her
enclosing
arm
but
we
stand
together
together
we
shall
not
fail
each
other
we
can
face
siege
until
father
you
wrote
to
him
last
night
a
long
letter
which
i
wish
him
to
receive
before
he
sails
he
might
decide
to
act
upon
it
before
leaving
new
york
to
advise
with
some
legal
authority
he
knows
and
trusts
to
prepare
our
mother
in
some
way
to
do
some
wise
thing
we
can
not
foresee
the
value
of
he
has
known
the
outline
of
the
story
but
not
exact
details
particularly
recent
ones
i
have
held
back
nothing
it
was
necessary
he
should
know
i
am
going
out
to
post
the
letter
myself
i
shall
send
a
cable
asking
him
to
prepare
to
come
to
us
after
he
has
reflected
on
what
i
have
rosalie
was
very
quiet
but
when
having
left
the
room
to
prepare
to
go
to
the
village
betty
came
back
to
say
a
last
word
her
sister
came
to
her
and
laid
her
hand
on
her
arm
i
have
been
so
weak
and
trodden
upon
for
years
that
it
would
not
be
natural
for
you
to
quite
trust
me
she
said
but
i
wo
fail
you
betty
i
the
winter
was
drawing
in
the
last
autumn
days
were
short
and
often
grey
and
dreary
the
wind
had
swept
the
leaves
from
the
trees
and
scattered
them
over
park
lands
and
lanes
where
they
lay
a
rustling
carpet
shifting
with
each
chill
breeze
that
blew
the
berried
briony
garlands
clung
to
the
bared
hedges
and
here
and
there
flared
scarlet
still
holding
their
red
defiantly
until
hard
frosts
should
come
to
shrivel
and
blacken
them
the
rare
hours
of
sunshine
were
amber
hours
instead
of
golden
as
she
passed
through
the
park
gate
betty
was
thinking
of
the
first
morning
on
which
she
had
walked
down
the
village
street
between
the
irregular
rows
of
cottages
with
the
ragged
little
enclosing
gardens
then
the
air
and
sunshine
had
been
of
the
just
awakening
spring
now
the
sky
was
brightly
cold
and
through
the
windows
she
caught
glimpses
of
fireglow
a
bent
old
man
walking
very
slowly
leaning
upon
two
sticks
had
a
woollen
muffler
wrapped
round
his
neck
seeing
her
he
stopped
and
shuffled
the
two
sticks
into
one
hand
that
he
might
leave
the
other
free
to
touch
his
wrinkled
forehead
stiffly
his
face
stretching
into
a
slow
smile
as
she
stopped
to
speak
to
him
marlow
he
said
how
is
the
rheumatism
he
was
a
deaf
old
man
whose
conversation
was
carried
on
principally
by
guesswork
and
it
was
easy
for
him
to
gather
that
when
her
handsome
young
sister
had
given
him
greeting
she
had
not
forgotten
to
inquire
respecting
the
rheumatics
which
formed
the
greater
part
of
existence
mornin
miss
mornin
he
answered
in
the
high
cracked
voice
of
rural
ancientry
winter
be
nigh
an
they
damp
days
be
full
of
rheumatiz
easy
to
get
about
on
my
old
legs
but
i
be
main
thankful
for
they
warm
things
you
sent
miss
this
fumbling
at
his
muffler
proudly
is
a
comfort
on
windy
days
so
and
warmth
be
a
good
thing
to
a
man
when
he
be
goin
down
hill
in
all
of
you
who
are
not
able
to
earn
your
own
fires
shall
be
warm
this
winter
her
ladyship
handsome
sister
said
speaking
closer
to
his
ear
you
shall
all
be
warm
do
be
afraid
of
the
cold
days
he
shuffled
his
sticks
and
touched
his
forehead
again
looking
up
at
her
admiringly
and
chuckling
be
a
new
tale
for
stornham
village
he
cackled
be
a
new
tale
thank
ye
miss
thank
as
she
nodded
smilingly
and
passed
on
she
heard
him
cackling
still
under
his
breath
as
he
hobbled
on
his
slow
way
comforted
and
elate
how
almost
shamefully
easy
it
was
a
few
loads
of
coal
and
faggots
here
and
there
a
few
blankets
and
warm
garments
whose
cost
counted
for
so
little
when
one
hands
were
full
could
change
a
gruesome
village
winter
into
a
season
during
which
and
broken
old
things
closing
their
cottage
doors
could
draw
their
chairs
round
the
hearth
and
hover
luxuriously
over
the
red
glow
which
in
its
comforting
fashion
of
seeming
to
have
understanding
of
the
dull
dreams
in
old
eyes
was
more
to
be
loved
than
any
human
friend
but
she
had
not
needed
her
passing
speech
with
marlow
to
stimulate
realisation
of
how
much
she
had
learned
to
care
for
the
mere
living
among
these
people
to
whom
she
seemed
to
have
begun
to
belong
and
whose
comfortably
lighting
faces
when
they
met
her
showed
that
they
knew
her
to
be
one
who
might
be
turned
to
in
any
hour
of
trouble
or
dismay
the
centuries
which
had
trained
them
to
depend
upon
their
betters
had
taught
the
slowest
of
them
to
judge
with
keen
sight
those
who
were
to
be
trusted
not
alone
as
power
and
wealth
holders
but
as
creatures
humanly
upright
and
merciful
with
their
kind
workin
folk
allus
knows
gentry
old
doby
had
once
shrilled
to
her
gentry
gentry
an
us
knows
wheresoever
they
be
they
know
theirselves
so
us
do
yes
they
knew
and
though
they
accepted
many
things
as
being
merely
their
natural
rights
they
gave
an
unsentimental
affection
and
appreciation
in
return
the
patriarchal
note
in
the
life
was
lovable
to
her
each
creature
she
passed
was
a
sort
of
friend
who
seemed
almost
of
her
own
blood
it
had
come
to
that
this
particular
existence
was
more
satisfying
to
her
than
any
other
more
and
warmly
complete
though
i
am
only
an
impostor
she
thought
i
was
born
in
fifth
avenue
yet
since
i
have
known
this
i
shall
be
quite
happy
in
no
other
place
than
an
english
village
with
a
norman
church
tower
looking
down
upon
it
and
rows
of
little
gardens
with
spears
of
white
and
blue
lupins
and
canterbury
bells
standing
guard
before
cottage
and
rosalie
on
the
evening
of
that
first
strange
day
when
she
had
come
upon
her
piteous
figure
among
the
heather
under
the
trees
near
the
lake
rosalie
had
held
her
arm
with
a
hot
little
hand
and
had
said
feverishly
if
i
could
hear
the
roar
of
broadway
again
do
the
stages
rattle
as
they
used
to
betty
i
ca
help
hoping
that
they
she
carried
her
letter
to
the
post
and
stopped
to
talk
a
few
minutes
with
the
postmaster
who
transacted
his
official
business
in
a
small
shop
where
sides
of
bacon
and
hams
hung
suspended
from
the
ceiling
while
groceries
flannels
dress
prints
and
glass
bottles
of
sweet
stuff
filled
the
shelves
mr
tewson
was
the
central
point
of
stornham
in
a
commercial
sense
the
establishment
had
also
certain
social
qualifications
tewson
knew
the
secrets
of
all
hearts
within
the
village
radius
also
the
secrets
of
all
constitutions
he
knew
by
some
occult
means
who
had
been
taken
bad
or
who
had
taken
a
turn
and
was
aware
at
once
when
anyone
was
sinkin
with
such
differences
of
opinion
as
occasionally
arose
between
the
vicar
and
his
churchwardens
he
was
immediately
familiar
the
history
of
the
fever
among
the
hop
pickers
at
dunstan
village
he
had
been
able
to
relate
in
detail
from
the
moment
of
its
outbreak
it
was
he
who
had
first
dramatically
revealed
the
truth
of
the
action
miss
vanderpoel
had
taken
in
the
matter
which
revelation
had
aroused
such
enthusiasm
as
had
filled
the
clock
inn
to
overflowing
and
given
an
impetus
to
the
sale
of
beer
tread
it
was
said
had
even
made
a
speech
which
he
had
ended
with
vague
but
excellent
intentions
by
proposing
the
joint
healths
of
her
ladyship
sister
and
the
president
of
tewson
was
always
glad
to
see
miss
vanderpoel
cross
his
threshold
this
was
not
alone
because
she
represented
the
custom
of
the
court
which
since
her
arrival
had
meant
large
regular
orders
and
large
bills
promptly
paid
but
that
she
brought
with
her
an
exotic
atmosphere
of
interest
and
excitement
he
had
mentioned
to
friends
that
somehow
a
talk
with
her
made
him
feel
set
up
for
the
betty
was
not
at
all
sure
that
he
did
not
prepare
and
hoard
up
choice
remarks
or
bits
of
information
as
openings
to
conversation
this
morning
he
had
thrilling
news
for
her
and
began
with
it
at
once
dr
fenwick
at
stornham
is
very
low
miss
he
said
he
very
low
you
be
sorry
to
hear
the
worry
about
the
fever
upset
him
terrible
and
his
bronchitis
took
him
bad
he
an
old
man
you
miss
vanderpoel
was
very
sorry
to
hear
it
it
was
quite
in
the
natural
order
of
things
that
she
should
ask
other
questions
about
dunstan
village
and
the
mount
and
she
asked
several
the
fever
was
dying
out
and
pale
convalescents
were
sometimes
seen
in
the
village
or
strolling
about
the
park
his
lordship
was
taking
care
of
the
people
and
doing
his
best
for
them
until
they
should
be
strong
enough
to
return
to
their
homes
but
he
very
strict
about
making
it
plain
that
it
you
miss
they
have
to
thank
for
what
he
that
is
not
quite
just
said
miss
vanderpoel
he
and
penzance
fought
on
the
field
i
only
supplied
some
of
the
the
county
does
think
of
him
as
it
did
even
a
year
ago
miss
said
tewson
rather
smugly
he
was
very
ill
thought
of
then
among
the
gentry
it
wonderful
the
change
that
come
about
if
he
should
fall
ill
there
be
a
deal
of
i
hope
there
is
no
question
of
his
falling
ill
said
miss
vanderpoel
tewson
lowered
his
voice
confidentially
this
was
really
his
most
valuable
item
of
news
well
miss
he
admitted
i
have
heard
that
he
been
looking
very
bad
for
a
good
bit
and
it
was
told
me
quite
private
because
the
doctors
and
the
vicar
do
want
the
people
to
be
upset
by
hearing
it
that
for
a
week
he
not
been
well
enough
to
make
his
oh
the
exclamation
was
a
faint
one
but
it
was
an
exclamation
i
hope
that
means
nothing
really
serious
miss
vanderpoel
added
everyone
will
hope
yes
miss
said
tewson
deftly
twisting
the
string
round
the
package
he
was
tying
up
for
her
a
sad
reward
it
would
be
if
he
lost
his
life
after
doing
all
he
has
done
a
sad
reward
but
there
be
a
good
deal
of
the
small
package
contained
trifles
of
sewing
and
knitting
materials
she
was
going
to
take
to
welden
and
she
held
out
her
hand
for
it
she
knew
she
did
not
smile
quite
naturally
as
she
said
her
to
tewson
she
went
out
into
the
pale
amber
sunshine
and
stood
a
few
moments
glad
to
find
herself
bathed
in
it
again
she
suddenly
needed
air
and
light
a
sad
reward
sometimes
people
were
not
rewarded
brave
men
were
shot
dead
on
the
battlefield
when
they
were
doing
brave
things
brave
physicians
and
nurses
died
of
the
plagues
they
faithfully
wrestled
with
here
were
dread
and
pain
confronting
her
betty
vanderpoel
and
while
almost
everyone
else
seemed
to
have
faced
them
she
was
wholly
unused
to
their
appalling
clutch
what
a
life
hers
had
been
that
in
looking
back
over
it
she
should
realise
that
she
had
never
been
touched
by
anything
like
this
before
there
came
back
to
her
the
look
of
almost
awed
wonder
in
selden
honest
eyes
when
he
said
what
it
must
be
to
be
you
just
you
he
had
been
thinking
only
of
the
millions
and
of
the
freedom
from
all
everyday
anxieties
the
millions
gave
she
smiled
faintly
as
the
thought
crossed
her
brain
the
millions
the
rolling
up
of
them
year
by
year
because
millions
were
breeders
the
newspaper
stories
of
them
the
wonder
at
and
belief
in
their
power
it
was
all
going
on
just
as
before
and
yet
here
stood
a
vanderpoel
in
an
english
village
street
of
no
more
worth
as
far
as
power
to
aid
herself
went
than
joe
buttle
girl
with
the
thick
waist
and
round
red
cheeks
jenny
buttle
would
have
believed
that
her
ladyship
rich
american
sister
could
do
anything
she
chose
open
any
door
command
any
presence
sweep
aside
any
obstacle
with
a
wave
of
her
hand
but
of
the
two
jenny
buttle
path
would
have
laid
straighter
before
her
if
she
had
had
a
young
man
who
had
fallen
ill
she
would
have
been
free
if
his
mother
had
cherished
no
objection
to
their
walking
out
to
spend
all
her
spare
hours
in
his
cottage
making
gruel
and
poultices
crying
until
her
nose
and
eyes
were
red
and
pouring
forth
her
hopes
and
fears
to
any
neighbour
who
came
in
or
out
or
hung
over
the
dividing
garden
hedge
if
the
patient
died
the
deeper
her
mourning
and
the
louder
her
sobs
at
his
funeral
the
more
respectable
and
deserving
of
sympathy
and
admiration
would
jenny
buttle
have
been
counted
her
ladyship
rich
american
sister
had
no
young
man
she
had
not
at
any
time
been
asked
to
walk
even
in
the
dark
days
of
the
fever
each
of
which
had
carried
thought
and
action
of
hers
to
the
scene
of
trouble
there
had
reigned
unbroken
silence
except
for
the
vicar
notes
of
warm
and
appreciative
gratitude
you
are
very
obstinate
fergus
penzance
had
said
and
mount
dunstan
had
shaken
his
head
fiercely
and
answered
do
speak
to
me
about
it
only
obstinacy
will
save
me
from
behaving
like
other
penzance
carefully
polishing
his
eyeglasses
as
he
watched
him
was
not
sparing
in
his
comment
that
is
pure
folly
he
said
pure
stubborn
folly
charging
with
its
head
down
before
it
has
done
with
you
it
will
have
made
you
suffer
quite
be
sure
of
that
mount
dunstan
had
said
setting
his
teeth
as
he
sat
in
his
chair
clasping
his
hands
behind
his
head
and
glowering
into
space
penzance
quietly
speculatively
looked
him
over
and
reflected
aloud
or
so
it
sounded
it
is
a
and
characteristic
but
there
are
things
which
are
stronger
some
one
minute
will
arrive
just
one
minute
which
will
be
stronger
one
of
those
moments
when
the
mysteries
of
the
universe
are
at
do
speak
to
me
like
that
i
tell
you
mount
dunstan
broke
out
passionately
and
he
sprang
up
and
marched
out
of
the
room
like
an
angry
man
miss
vanderpoel
did
not
go
to
welden
cottage
at
once
but
walked
past
its
door
down
the
lane
where
there
were
no
more
cottages
but
only
hedges
and
fields
on
either
side
of
her
not
well
enough
to
make
his
rounds
might
mean
much
or
little
it
might
mean
a
temporary
breakdown
from
overfatigue
or
a
sickening
for
deadly
illness
she
looked
at
a
group
of
cropping
sheep
in
a
field
and
at
a
flock
of
rooks
which
had
just
alighted
near
it
with
cawing
and
flapping
of
wings
she
kept
her
eyes
on
them
merely
to
steady
herself
the
thoughts
she
had
brought
out
with
her
had
grown
heavier
and
were
horribly
difficult
to
control
one
must
not
allow
one
self
to
believe
the
worst
will
come
one
must
not
allow
it
she
always
held
this
rule
before
herself
and
now
she
was
not
holding
it
steadily
there
was
nothing
to
do
she
could
write
a
mere
note
of
inquiry
to
penzance
but
that
was
all
she
could
only
walk
up
and
down
the
lanes
and
think
whether
he
lay
dying
or
not
she
could
do
nothing
even
if
a
day
came
when
she
knew
that
a
pit
had
been
dug
in
the
clay
and
he
had
been
lowered
into
it
with
creaking
ropes
and
the
clods
shovelled
back
upon
him
where
he
lay
still
never
having
told
her
that
he
was
glad
that
her
being
had
turned
to
him
and
her
heart
cried
aloud
his
name
she
recalled
with
curious
distinctness
the
effect
of
the
steady
toll
of
the
church
bell
the
passing
she
could
hear
it
as
she
had
heard
it
the
first
time
it
fell
upon
her
ear
and
she
had
inquired
what
it
meant
why
did
they
call
it
the
passing
bell
all
had
passed
before
it
began
to
toll
all
had
passed
if
it
tolled
at
dunstan
and
the
pit
was
dug
in
the
churchyard
before
her
father
came
would
he
see
the
moment
they
met
that
something
had
befallen
her
that
the
betty
he
had
known
was
changed
gone
yes
he
would
see
affection
such
as
his
always
saw
then
he
would
sit
alone
with
her
in
some
quiet
room
and
talk
to
her
and
she
would
tell
him
the
strange
thing
that
had
happened
he
would
understand
perhaps
better
than
she
she
stopped
abruptly
in
her
walk
and
stood
still
the
hand
holding
her
package
was
quite
cold
this
was
what
one
must
not
allow
one
self
but
how
the
thoughts
had
raced
through
her
brain
she
turned
and
hastened
her
steps
towards
welden
cottage
in
welden
tiny
back
yard
there
stood
a
coal
lodge
suited
to
the
size
of
the
domicile
and
already
stacked
with
a
full
winter
supply
of
coal
therefore
the
and
cleanly
little
grate
in
the
was
bright
with
fire
old
doby
who
had
tottered
round
the
corner
to
pay
his
fellow
gossip
a
visit
was
sitting
by
it
and
old
welden
clean
as
to
cap
and
apron
and
small
purple
shoulder
shawl
had
evidently
been
allaying
his
natural
anxiety
as
to
the
conduct
of
foreign
sovereigns
by
reading
in
a
loud
voice
the
print
under
the
pictures
in
an
illustrated
paper
this
occupation
had
however
been
interrupted
a
few
moments
before
miss
vanderpoel
arrival
bester
the
neighbour
in
the
next
cottage
had
stepped
in
with
her
youngest
on
her
hip
and
was
talking
breathlessly
she
paused
to
drop
her
curtsy
as
betty
entered
and
old
doby
stood
up
and
made
his
salute
with
a
trembling
hand
she
know
he
said
gentry
knows
the
ins
an
outs
of
gentry
fust
she
know
the
what
has
happened
bester
unexpectedly
burst
into
tears
there
was
an
element
in
the
female
villagers
temperament
which
betty
had
found
was
frequently
unexpected
in
its
breaking
forth
he
down
miss
she
said
he
down
with
it
crool
bad
there
be
no
savin
of
him
betty
laid
her
package
of
sewing
cotton
and
knitting
wool
quietly
on
the
blue
and
white
checked
tablecloth
who
is
he
she
asked
his
lordship
and
him
just
saved
all
dunstan
parish
from
death
to
go
like
this
in
stornham
village
and
in
all
others
of
the
neighbourhood
the
feminine
attitude
towards
mount
dunstan
had
been
one
of
strongly
emotional
admiration
the
thwarted
female
longing
for
romance
the
desire
for
drama
and
a
hero
had
been
fed
by
him
a
fine
big
young
man
one
that
had
been
spoke
ill
of
and
regarded
as
an
outcast
had
suddenly
turned
the
tables
on
fortune
and
made
himself
the
central
figure
of
the
county
the
talk
of
gentry
in
their
grand
houses
of
cottage
women
on
their
doorsteps
and
labourers
stopping
to
speak
to
each
other
by
the
roadside
magic
stories
had
been
told
of
him
beflowered
with
dramatic
detail
no
incident
could
have
been
related
to
his
credit
which
would
not
have
been
believed
and
improved
upon
shut
up
in
his
village
working
among
his
people
and
unseen
by
outsiders
he
had
become
a
popular
idol
any
scrap
of
news
of
him
any
rumour
true
or
untrue
was
seized
upon
and
excitedly
spread
abroad
therefore
bester
wept
as
she
talked
and
if
the
truth
must
be
told
enjoyed
the
situation
she
was
the
first
to
tell
the
story
to
her
ladyship
sister
herself
as
well
as
to
welden
and

when
it
was
over
for

hear
the
church

here
same
as

the
minute
they

it
miss
lord
help
us
with
a
fresh
outburst
of
crying
it
do
seem
like
it
fair
as
it
should
be
when
we
hear
the
bell
toll
miss
do
said
her
ladyship
handsome
sister
suddenly
please
do
say
it
she
sat
down
by
the
table
and
resting
her
elbows
on
the
blue
and
white
checked
cloth
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
she
did
not
speak
at
all
in
this
tiny
room
with
these
two
old
souls
who
loved
her
she
need
not
explain
she
sat
quite
still
and
welden
after
looking
at
her
for
a
few
seconds
was
prompted
by
some
sublimely
simple
intuition
and
gently
sidled
bester
and
her
youngest
into
the
little
kitchen
where
the
copper
was
her
helpin
him
like
she
did
makes
it
come
near
she
whispered
dessay
it
seems
as
if
he
was
like
a
old
doby
sat
and
looked
at
his
goddess
in
his
slowly
moving
old
brain
stirred
memories
like
things
striving
to
come
to
life
he
did
not
know
what
they
were
but
they
wakened
his
dim
eyes
to
a
new
seeing
of
the
slim
young
shape
leaning
a
little
forward
the
soft
cloud
of
hair
the
fair
beauty
of
the
cheek
he
had
not
seen
anything
like
it
in
his
youth
but
it
was
youth
itself
and
so
was
that
which
the
ringers
were
so
soon
to
toll
for
and
for
some
remote
and
unformed
reason
to
his
scores
of
years
they
were
pitiful
and
should
be
cheered
he
bent
forward
himself
and
put
out
his
ancient
veined
and
knotted
gnarled
and
trembling
hand
to
timorously
touch
the
arm
of
her
he
worshipped
and
adored
god
bless
ye
he
said
his
high
cracked
voice
even
more
shrill
and
thin
than
usual
god
bless
ye
and
as
she
let
her
hands
slip
down
and
turning
gently
looked
at
him
he
nodded
to
her
speakingly
because
out
of
the
dimness
of
his
being
some
part
of
nature
working
had
strangely
answered
and
understood
chapter
xlvi
listening
on
her
way
back
to
the
court
her
eyes
saw
only
the
white
road
before
her
feet
as
she
walked
she
did
not
lift
them
until
she
found
herself
passing
the
at
the
entrance
to
the
churchyard
then
suddenly
she
looked
up
at
the
square
grey
stone
tower
where
the
bells
hung
and
from
which
they
called
the
village
to
church
or
chimed
for
weddings
or
gave
slowly
forth
to
the
silent
air
one
heavy
regular
stroke
after
another
she
looked
and
shuddered
and
spoke
aloud
with
a
curious
passionate
imploring
like
a
child
oh
do
toll
do
toll
you
must
not
you
can
not
terror
had
sprung
upon
her
and
her
heart
was
being
torn
in
two
in
her
breast
that
was
surely
what
it
seemed
like
this
agonising
ache
of
fear
now
from
hour
to
hour
she
would
be
waiting
and
listening
to
each
sound
borne
on
the
air
her
thought
would
be
a
possession
she
could
not
escape
when
she
spoke
or
was
spoken
to
she
would
be
listening
when
she
was
silent
every
echo
would
hold
terror
when
she
slept
if
sleep
should
come
to
her
her
hearing
would
be
awake
and
she
would
be
listening
listening
even
then
it
was
not
betty
vanderpoel
who
was
walking
along
the
white
road
but
another
creature
a
girl
whose
brain
was
full
of
abnormal
thought
and
whose
whole
being
made
passionate
outcry
against
the
thing
which
was
being
slowly
forced
upon
her
if
the
bell
tolled
suddenly
the
whole
world
would
be
swept
clean
of
life
empty
and
clean
if
the
bell
tolled
before
the
entrance
of
the
court
she
saw
as
she
approached
it
the
vicarage
pony
carriage
standing
as
it
had
stood
on
the
day
she
had
returned
from
her
walk
on
the
marshes
she
felt
it
quite
natural
that
it
should
be
there
brent
always
seized
upon
any
fragment
of
news
and
having
seized
on
something
now
she
had
not
been
able
to
resist
the
excitement
of
bringing
it
to
lady
anstruthers
and
her
sister
she
was
in
the
with
rosalie
and
was
full
of
her
subject
and
the
emotion
suitable
to
the
occasion
she
had
even
attained
a
certain
modified
dampness
of
handkerchief
rosalie
handkerchief
however
was
not
damp
she
had
not
even
attempted
to
use
it
but
sat
still
her
eyes
brimming
with
tears
which
when
she
saw
betty
brimmed
over
and
slipped
helplessly
down
her
cheeks
betty
she
exclaimed
and
got
up
and
went
towards
her
i
believe
you
have
in
the
village
i
heard
something
yes
betty
answered
and
after
giving
greeting
to
brent
she
led
her
sister
back
to
her
chair
and
sat
near
her
this
the
thought
leaped
upon
her
was
the
kind
of
situation
she
must
be
prepared
to
be
equal
to
in
the
presence
of
these
who
knew
nothing
she
must
bear
herself
as
if
there
was
nothing
to
be
known
no
one
but
herself
had
the
slightest
knowledge
of
what
the
past
months
had
brought
to
her
no
one
in
the
world
if
the
bell
tolled
no
one
in
the
world
but
her
father
ever
would
know
she
had
no
excuse
for
emotion
none
had
been
given
to
her
the
kind
of
thing
it
was
proper
that
she
should
say
and
do
now
in
the
presence
of
brent
it
would
be
proper
and
decent
that
she
should
say
and
do
in
all
other
cases
she
must
comport
herself
as
betty
vanderpoel
would
if
she
were
moved
only
by
ordinary
human
sympathy
and
regret
we
must
remember
that
we
have
only
excited
rumour
to
depend
upon
she
said
lord
mount
dunstan
has
kept
his
village
under
almost
military
law
he
has
put
it
into
quarantine
no
one
is
allowed
to
leave
it
so
there
can
be
no
direct
source
of
information
one
can
not
be
sure
of
the
entire
truth
of
what
one
hears
often
it
is
exaggerated
cottage
talk
the
whole
neighbourhood
is
wrought
up
to
a
fever
heat
of
excited
sympathy
and
villagers
like
the
drama
of
brent
looked
at
her
admiringly
it
being
her
fixed
habit
to
admire
miss
vanderpoel
and
all
such
as
providence
had
set
above
her
oh
how
wise
you
are
miss
vanderpoel
she
exclaimed
even
devoutly
it
is
so
nice
of
you
to
be
calm
and
logical
when
everybody
else
is
so
upset
you
are
quite
right
about
villagers
enjoying
the
dramatic
side
of
troubles
they
always
do
and
perhaps
things
are
not
so
bad
as
they
say
i
ought
not
to
have
let
myself
believe
the
worst
but
i
quite
broke
down
under
the
ringers
i
was
so
the
ringers
faltered
lady
anstruthers
the
leader
came
to
the
vicar
to
tell
him
they
wanted
permission
to
toll
if
they
heard
tolling
at
dunstan
weaver
family
lives
within
hearing
of
dunstan
church
bells
and
one
of
his
boys
is
to
run
across
the
fields
and
bring
the
news
to
stornham
and
it
was
most
touching
miss
vanderpoel
they
feel
in
their
rustic
way
that
lord
mount
dunstan
has
not
been
treated
fairly
in
the
past
and
now
he
seems
to
them
a
hero
and
a
martyr
or
like
a
great
soldier
who
has
died
who
may
die
fighting
broke
from
miss
vanderpoel
sharply
who
who
may
brent
corrected
herself
though
heaven
grant
he
will
not
but
it
was
the
ringers
who
made
me
feel
as
if
all
really
was
over
thank
you
miss
vanderpoel
thank
you
for
being
so
practical
and
and
it
was
touching
said
lady
anstruthers
her
eyes
brimming
over
again
and
what
the
villagers
feel
is
true
it
goes
to
one
heart
in
a
little
outburst
people
have
been
unkind
to
him
and
he
has
been
lonely
in
that
great
empty
place
he
has
been
lonely
and
if
he
is
dying
he
is
lonely
even
as
he
dies
even
as
he
betty
drew
a
deep
breath
for
one
moment
there
seemed
to
rise
before
her
vision
of
a
huge
room
whose
stately
size
made
its
bareness
a
more
desolate
thing
and
penzance
bent
low
over
the
bed
she
tore
her
thought
away
from
it
no
no
she
cried
out
in
low
passionate
protest
there
will
be
love
and
yearning
all
about
him
everywhere
the
villagers
who
are
waiting
the
poor
things
he
has
worked
for
the
very
ringers
themselves
are
all
pouring
forth
the
same
thoughts
he
will
feel
even
ours
ours
too
his
soul
can
not
be
a
few
minutes
earlier
brent
had
been
saying
to
herself
inwardly
she
has
not
much
heart
after
all
you
now
she
looked
at
her
in
amazement
the
blue
bells
were
under
water
in
truth
drenched
and
drowned
and
yet
as
the
girl
stood
up
before
her
she
looked
taller
more
the
magnificent
miss
vanderpoel
than
ever
though
she
expressed
a
new
meaning
there
is
one
thing
the
villagers
can
do
for
him
she
said
one
thing
we
can
all
do
the
bell
has
not
tolled
yet
there
is
a
service
for
those
who
are
in
peril
if
the
vicar
will
call
the
people
to
the
church
we
can
all
kneel
down
there
and
ask
to
be
heard
the
vicar
will
do
that
i
am
sure
and
the
people
will
join
him
with
all
their
brent
was
overwhelmed
dear
dear
miss
vanderpoel
she
exclaimed
that
is
touching
indeed
it
is
and
so
right
and
so
proper
i
will
drive
back
to
the
village
at
once
the
vicar
distress
is
as
great
as
mine
you
think
of
everything
the
service
for
the
sick
and
dying
how
right
how
right
with
a
sense
of
an
increase
of
value
in
herself
the
vicar
and
the
vicarage
she
hastened
back
to
the
pony
carriage
but
in
the
hall
she
seized
betty
hand
emotionally
i
can
not
tell
you
how
much
i
am
touched
by
this
she
murmured
i
did
not
know
you
were
were
a
religious
girl
my
betty
answered
with
grave
politeness
in
times
of
great
pain
and
terror
she
said
i
think
almost
everybody
is
religious
a
little
if
that
is
the
right
there
was
no
ringing
of
the
ordinary
call
to
service
in
less
than
an
hour
time
people
began
to
come
out
of
their
cottages
and
wend
their
way
towards
the
church
no
one
had
put
on
his
or
her
sunday
clothes
the
women
had
hastily
rolled
down
their
sleeves
thrown
off
their
aprons
and
donned
everyday
bonnets
and
shawls
the
men
were
in
their
corduroys
as
they
had
come
in
from
the
fields
and
the
children
wore
their
pinafores
as
if
by
magic
the
news
had
flown
from
house
to
house
and
each
one
who
had
heard
it
had
left
his
or
her
work
without
a
hesitation
they
said
but
little
as
they
made
their
way
to
the
church
betty
walking
with
her
sister
was
struck
by
the
fact
that
there
were
more
of
them
than
formed
the
usual
sunday
morning
congregation
they
were
doing
no
perfunctory
duty
the
men
faces
were
heavily
moved
most
of
the
women
wiped
their
eyes
at
intervals
and
the
children
looked
awed
there
was
a
suggestion
of
hurried
movement
in
the
step
of
each
as
if
no
time
must
be
lost
as
if
they
must
begin
their
appeal
at
once
betty
saw
old
doby
tottering
along
stiffly
with
his
granddaughter
and
welden
on
either
side
of
him
marlow
on
his
two
sticks
was
to
be
seen
moving
slowly
but
steadily
within
the
ancient
stone
walls
stiff
old
knees
bent
themselves
with
care
and
faces
were
covered
devoutly
by
hands
as
she
passed
through
the
churchyard
betty
knew
that
eyes
followed
her
affectionately
and
that
the
touching
of
foreheads
and
dropping
of
curtsies
expressed
a
special
sympathy
in
each
mind
she
was
connected
with
the
man
they
came
to
pray
for
with
the
work
he
had
done
with
the
danger
he
was
in
it
was
vaguely
felt
that
if
his
life
ended
a
bereavement
would
have
fallen
upon
her
this
the
girl
knew
the
vicar
lifted
his
bowed
head
and
began
his
service
every
man
woman
and
child
before
him
responded
aloud
and
with
a
curious
fervour
not
in
decorous
fear
of
seeming
to
thrust
themselves
before
the
throne
making
too
much
of
their
petitions
in
the
presence
of
the
gentry
here
and
there
sobs
were
to
be
heard
lady
anstruthers
followed
the
service
timorously
and
with
tears
but
betty
kneeling
at
her
side
by
the
round
table
in
the
centre
of
the
great
square
stornham
pew
which
was
like
a
room
bowed
her
head
upon
her
folded
arms
and
prayed
her
own
intense
insistent
prayer
god
in
heaven
was
her
inward
cry
god
of
all
the
worlds
do
not
let
him

of
faith
and
i
pray

count

against
me
as
sin

made
him
he
has
suffered
and
been
alone
it
is
not

it
is
not
time
yet
for
him
to
go
he
has
known
no
joy
and
no
bright
thing
do
not
let
him
go
out
of
the
warm
world
like
a
blind
man

raging

gone
from
me
god
of
the
worlds
and
the
great
winds
and
the
myriad
stars
do
not
let
him
die
she
knew
her
thoughts
were
wild
but
their
torrent
bore
her
with
them
into
a
strange
great
silence
she
did
not
hear
the
vicar
words
or
the
responses
of
the
people
she
was
not
within
the
grey
stone
walls
she
had
been
drawn
away
as
into
the
darkness
and
stillness
of
the
night
and
no
soul
but
her
own
seemed
near
through
the
stillness
and
the
dark
her
praying
seemed
to
call
and
echo
clamouring
again
and
again
it
must
reach
something
it
must
be
heard
because
she
cried
so
loud
though
to
the
human
beings
about
her
she
seemed
kneeling
in
silence
she
went
on
and
on
repeating
her
words
changing
them
ending
and
beginning
again
pouring
forth
a
flood
of
appeal
she
thought
later
that
the
flood
must
have
been
at
its
highest
tide
when
singularly
it
was
stemmed
without
warning
a
wave
of
awe
passed
over
her
which
strangely
silenced
her
and
left
her
bowed
and
kneeling
but
crying
out
no
more
the
darkness
had
become
still
even
as
it
had
not
been
still
before
suddenly
she
cowered
as
she
knelt
and
held
her
breath
something
had
drawn
a
little
near
no
thoughts
no
words
no
cries
were
needed
as
the
great
stillness
grew
and
spread
and
folded
her
being
within
it
she
waited
only
waited
she
did
not
know
how
long
a
time
passed
before
she
felt
herself
drawn
back
from
the
silent
and
shadowy
places
awakening
as
it
were
to
the
sounds
in
the
church
our
father
she
began
to
say
as
simply
as
a
child
our
father
who
art
in
heaven
hallowed
be
thy
there
was
a
stirring
among
the
congregation
and
sounds
of
feet
as
the
people
began
to
move
down
the
aisle
in
reverent
slowness
she
caught
again
the
occasional
sound
of
a
subdued
sob
rosalie
gently
touched
her
and
she
rose
following
her
out
of
the
big
pew
and
passing
down
the
aisle
after
the
villagers
outside
the
entrance
the
people
waited
as
if
they
wanted
to
see
her
again
foreheads
were
touched
as
before
and
eyes
followed
her
she
was
to
the
general
mind
the
centre
of
the
drama
and
the
would
do
well
to
hear
her
she
had
been
doing
his
work
for
him
same
as
his
they
did
not
expect
her
to
smile
at
such
a
time
when
she
returned
their
greetings
and
she
did
not
but
they
said
afterwards
in
their
cottages
that
trouble
or
not
she
was
a
wonder
for
looks
that
she
was
miss
rosalie
slipped
a
hand
through
her
arm
and
they
walked
home
together
very
close
to
each
other
now
and
then
there
was
a
questioning
in
look
but
neither
of
them
spoke
once
on
an
oak
table
in
the
hall
a
letter
from
penzance
was
lying
it
was
brief
hurried
and
anxious
the
rumour
that
mount
dunstan
had
been
ailing
was
true
and
that
they
had
felt
they
must
conceal
the
matter
from
the
villagers
was
true
also
for
some
baffling
reason
the
fever
had
not
absolutely
declared
itself
but
the
young
doctors
were
beset
by
grave
forebodings
in
such
cases
the
most
serious
symptoms
might
suddenly
develop
one
never
knew
penzance
was
evidently
torn
by
fears
which
he
desperately
strove
to
suppress
but
betty
could
see
the
anguish
on
his
fine
old
face
and
between
the
lines
she
read
dread
and
warning
not
put
into
words
she
believed
that
fearing
the
worst
he
felt
he
must
prepare
her
mind
he
has
lived
under
a
great
strain
for
months
he
ended
it
began
long
before
the
outbreak
of
the
fever
i
am
not
strong
under
my
sense
of
the
cruelty
of
things
and
i
have
never
loved
him
as
i
love
him
betty
took
the
letter
to
her
room
and
read
it
two
or
three
times
because
she
had
asked
intelligent
questions
of
the
medical
authority
she
had
consulted
on
her
visit
to
london
she
knew
something
of
the
fever
and
its
habits
even
her
unclerical
knowledge
was
such
as
it
was
not
well
to
reflect
upon
she
refolded
the
letter
and
laid
it
aside
i
must
not
think
i
must
do
something
it
may
prevent
my
listening
she
said
aloud
to
the
silence
of
her
room
she
cast
her
eyes
about
her
as
if
in
search
upon
her
desk
lay
a
notebook
she
took
it
up
and
opened
it
it
contained
lists
of
plants
of
flower
seeds
of
bulbs
and
shrubs
each
list
was
headed
with
an
explanatory
note
yes
this
will
do
she
said
i
will
go
and
talk
to
kedgers
and
every
man
under
him
had
been
at
the
service
but
they
had
returned
to
their
respective
duties
kedgers
giving
directions
to
some
under
gardeners
who
were
clearing
flower
beds
and
preparing
them
for
their
winter
rest
turned
to
meet
her
as
she
approached
to
kedgers
the
sight
of
her
coming
towards
him
on
a
garden
path
was
a
joyful
thing
he
had
done
wonders
it
is
true
but
if
she
had
not
stood
by
his
side
with
inspiration
as
well
as
confidence
he
knew
that
things
might
have
come
out
you
was
born
a
gardener
miss
born
one
he
had
said
months
ago
it
was
the
time
when
flower
beds
must
be
planned
for
the
coming
year
her
notebook
was
filled
with
memoranda
of
the
things
they
must
talk
about
it
was
good
normal
healthy
work
to
do
the
scent
of
the
rich
damp
upturned
mould
was
a
good
thing
to
inhale
they
walked
from
one
end
to
another
stood
before
clumps
of
shrubs
and
studied
bits
of
wall
here
a
mass
of
blue
might
grow
here
low
things
of
white
and
pale
yellow
a
rose
would
hang
sheets
of
bloom
over
this
dead
tree
this
sheltered
wall
would
hold
warmth
for
a
marechal
niel
you
must
take
care
of
it
all
even
if
i
am
not
here
next
year
miss
vanderpoel
said
kedgers
absorbed
face
changed
not
here
miss
he
exclaimed
you
not
here
things
would
grow
he
checked
himself
his
skin
reddening
because
he
was
afraid
he
had
perhaps
taken
a
liberty
and
then
moving
his
hat
uneasily
on
his
head
he
took
another
but
it
true
enough
looking
down
on
the
gravel
walk
we
we
could
expect
to
keep
she
did
not
look
as
if
she
had
noticed
the
liberty
but
she
did
not
look
quite
like
herself
kedgers
thought
if
she
had
been
another
young
lady
and
but
for
his
established
feeling
that
she
was
somehow
immune
from
all
ills
he
would
have
thought
she
had
a
headache
or
was
low
in
her
mind
she
spent
an
hour
or
two
with
him
and
together
they
planned
for
the
changing
seasons
of
the
year
to
come
how
she
could
keep
her
mind
on
a
thing
and
what
a
head
she
had
for
planning
and
what
an
eye
for
colour
but
yes
there
was
something
a
bit
wrong
somehow
now
and
then
she
would
stop
and
stand
still
for
a
moment
and
suddenly
it
struck
kedgers
that
she
looked
as
if
she
were
listening
did
you
think
you
heard
something
miss
he
asked
her
once
when
she
paused
and
wore
this
look
no
she
answered
and
drew
him
on
quickly
almost
as
if
she
did
not
want
him
to
hear
what
she
had
seemed
listening
for
when
she
left
him
and
went
back
to
the
house
all
the
loveliness
of
spring
summer
and
autumn
had
been
thought
out
and
provided
for
kedgers
stood
on
the
path
and
looked
after
her
until
she
passed
through
the
terrace
door
he
chewed
his
lip
uneasily
then
he
remembered
something
and
felt
a
bit
relieved
it
was
the
service
he
remembered
ah
it
that
that
upset
her
and
it
natural
seeing
how
helped
him
and
dunstan
village
it
only
he
chewed
his
lip
again
and
nodded
his
head
in
odd
reflection
ay
ay
he
summed
her
up
she
a
great
lady
that
she
a
great
lady
same
as
if
she
been
born
in
a
civilised
during
the
rest
of
the
day
the
look
of
question
in
rosalie
eyes
changed
in
its
nature
when
her
sister
was
near
her
she
found
herself
glancing
at
her
with
a
new
feeling
it
was
a
growing
feeling
which
gradually
became
anxiousness
betty
presented
to
her
the
aspect
of
one
withdrawn
into
some
remote
space
she
was
not
living
this
day
as
her
days
were
usually
lived
she
did
not
sit
still
or
stroll
about
the
gardens
quietly
the
consecutiveness
of
her
action
seemed
broken
she
did
one
thing
after
another
as
if
she
must
fill
each
moment
this
was
not
her
betty
lady
anstruthers
watched
and
thought
until
in
the
end
a
new
pained
fear
began
to
creep
slowly
into
her
mind
and
make
her
feel
as
if
she
were
slightly
trembling
though
her
hands
did
not
shake
she
did
not
dare
to
allow
herself
to
think
the
thing
she
knew
she
was
on
the
brink
of
thinking
she
thrust
it
away
from
her
and
tried
not
to
think
at
all
her
betty
her
splendid
betty
whom
nothing
could
hurt
who
could
not
be
touched
by
any
awful
thing
her
dear
betty
in
the
afternoon
she
saw
her
write
notes
steadily
for
an
hour
then
she
went
out
into
the
stables
and
visited
the
horses
talked
to
the
coachman
and
to
her
own
groom
she
was
very
kind
to
a
village
boy
who
had
been
recently
taken
on
as
an
additional
assistant
in
the
stable
and
who
was
rather
frightened
and
shy
she
knew
his
mother
who
had
a
large
family
and
she
had
indeed
given
the
boy
his
place
that
he
might
be
trained
under
the
great
buckham
who
was
coachman
and
head
of
the
stables
she
said
encouraging
things
which
quite
cheered
him
and
she
spoke
privately
to
buckham
about
him
then
she
walked
in
the
park
a
little
but
not
for
long
when
she
came
back
rosalie
was
waiting
for
her
i
want
to
take
a
long
drive
she
said
i
feel
restless
will
you
come
with
me
betty
yes
she
would
go
with
her
so
buckham
brought
the
landau
with
its
pair
of
big
horses
and
they
rolled
down
the
avenue
and
into
the
smooth
white
high
road
he
took
them
far
past
the
great
marshes
between
miles
of
bared
hedges
past
farms
and
scattered
cottages
sometimes
he
turned
into
lanes
where
the
hedges
were
closer
to
each
other
and
where
here
and
there
they
caught
sight
of
new
points
of
view
between
trees
betty
was
glad
to
feel
rosy
slim
body
near
her
side
and
she
was
conscious
that
it
gradually
seemed
to
draw
closer
and
closer
then
rosy
hand
slipped
into
hers
and
held
it
softly
on
her
lap
when
they
drove
together
in
this
way
they
were
usually
both
of
them
rather
silent
and
quiet
but
now
rosalie
spoke
of
many
things
of
ughtred
of
nigel
of
the
dunholms
of
new
york
and
their
father
and
mother
i
want
to
talk
because
i
nervous
i
think
she
said
half
apologetically
i
do
not
want
to
sit
still
and
think
too
much
of
father
coming
you
do
mind
my
talking
do
you
betty
no
betty
answered
it
is
good
for
you
and
for
and
she
met
the
pressure
of
rosy
hand
halfway
but
rosy
was
talking
not
because
she
did
not
want
to
sit
still
and
think
but
because
she
did
not
want
betty
to
do
so
and
all
the
time
she
was
trying
to
thrust
away
the
thought
growing
in
her
mind
they
spent
the
evening
together
in
the
library
and
betty
read
aloud
she
read
a
long
time
until
quite
late
she
wished
to
tire
herself
as
well
as
to
force
herself
to
stop
listening
when
they
said
to
each
other
rosy
clung
to
her
as
desperately
as
she
had
clung
on
the
night
after
her
arrival
she
kissed
her
again
and
again
and
then
hung
her
head
and
excused
herself
forgive
me
for
being
nervous
i
ashamed
of
myself
she
said
perhaps
in
time
i
shall
get
over
being
a
but
she
said
nothing
of
the
fact
that
she
was
not
a
coward
for
herself
but
through
a
slowly
formulating
and
struggled
against
fear
which
chilled
her
very
heart
and
which
she
could
best
cover
by
a
pretence
of
being
a
poltroon
she
could
not
sleep
when
she
went
to
bed
the
night
seemed
crowded
with
strange
terrified
thoughts
they
were
all
of
betty
though
sometimes
she
thought
of
her
father
coming
of
her
mother
in
new
york
and
of
betty
steady
working
throughout
the
day
sometimes
she
cried
twisting
her
hands
together
and
sometimes
she
dropped
into
a
feverish
sleep
and
dreamed
that
she
was
watching
betty
face
yet
was
afraid
to
look
at
it
she
awakened
suddenly
from
one
of
these
dreams
and
sat
upright
in
bed
to
find
the
dawn
breaking
she
rose
and
threw
on
a
and
went
to
her
sister
room
because
she
could
not
bear
to
stay
away
the
door
was
not
locked
and
she
pushed
it
open
gently
one
of
the
windows
had
its
blind
drawn
up
and
looked
like
a
patch
of
dull
grey
betty
was
standing
upright
near
it
she
was
in
her
and
a
long
black
plait
of
hair
hung
over
one
shoulder
heavily
she
looked
all
black
and
white
in
strong
contrast
the
grey
light
set
her
forth
as
a
tall
ghost
lady
anstruthers
slid
forward
feeling
a
tightness
in
her
chest
the
dawn
wakened
me
too
she
said
i
have
been
waiting
to
see
it
come
answered
betty
it
is
going
to
be
a
dull
dreary
chapter
xlvii
i
have
no
word
or
look
to
remember
it
was
a
dull
and
dreary
day
as
betty
had
foreseen
it
would
be
heavy
rain
clouds
hung
and
threatened
and
the
atmosphere
was
damp
and
chill
it
was
one
of
those
days
of
the
english
autumn
which
speak
only
of
the
end
of
things
bereaving
one
of
the
power
to
remember
next
year
spring
and
summer
which
after
all
must
surely
come
sky
is
grey
trees
are
grey
dead
leaves
lie
damp
beneath
the
feet
sunlight
and
birds
seem
forgotten
things
all
that
has
been
sad
and
to
be
regretted
or
feared
hangs
heavy
in
the
air
and
sways
all
thought
in
the
passing
of
these
hours
there
is
no
hope
anywhere
betty
appeared
at
breakfast
in
short
dress
and
close
hat
she
wore
thick
little
boots
as
if
for
walking
i
am
going
to
make
visits
in
the
village
she
said
i
want
a
basket
of
good
things
to
take
with
me
stourton
children
need
feeding
after
their
measles
they
looked
very
thin
when
i
saw
them
playing
in
the
road
yes
dear
rosalie
answered
mrs
noakes
shall
prepare
the

my
lady
jennings
knew
the
kind
of
basket
and
so
did
noakes
below
stairs
a
strong
sympathy
with
miss
vanderpoel
movements
had
developed
no
one
resented
the
preparation
of
baskets
somehow
they
were
always
managed
even
if
asked
for
at
untimely
hours
betty
was
sitting
silent
looking
out
into
the
greyness
of
the
park
are
are
you
listening
for
anything
betty
lady
anstruthers
asked
rather
falteringly

have
a
sort
of
listening
look
in
your
betty
came
back
to
the
room
as
it
were
have
i
she
said
yes
i
think
i
was
listening
for
and
rosalie
did
not
ask
her
what
she
listened
for
she
was
afraid
she
knew
it
was
not
only
the
stourtons
betty
visited
this
morning
she
passed
from
one
cottage
to
another
to
see
old
women
and
old
men
as
well
as
young
ones
who
for
one
reason
or
another
needed
help
and
encouragement
by
one
bedside
she
read
aloud
by
another
she
sat
and
told
cheerful
stories
she
listened
to
talk
in
little
kitchens
and
in
one
house
welcomed
a
newborn
thing
as
she
walked
steadily
over
grey
road
and
down
grey
lanes
damp
mist
rose
and
hung
about
her
and
she
did
not
walk
alone
fear
walked
with
her
and
anguish
a
grey
ghost
by
her
side
once
she
found
herself
standing
quite
still
on
a
side
path
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
she
filled
every
moment
of
the
morning
and
walked
until
she
was
tired
before
she
went
home
she
called
at
the
post
office
and
tewson
greeted
her
with
a
solemn
face
he
did
not
wait
to
be
questioned
there
been
no
news
miss
so
far
he
said
and
that
seems
as
if
they
might
be
so
given
up
to
hard
work
at
a
dreadful
time
that
there
been
no
chance
for
anything
to
get
out
when
people
hanging
over
a
man
bed
at
the
end
it
as
if
everything
stopped
but
that
that
stopping
for
all
after
luncheon
the
rain
began
to
fall
softly
slowly
and
with
a
suggestion
of
endlessness
it
was
a
sort
of
mist
itself
and
became
a
damp
shadow
among
the
bare
branches
of
trees
which
soon
began
to
drip
you
have
been
walking
about
all
morning
and
you
are
tired
dear
lady
anstruthers
said
to
her
wo
you
go
to
your
room
and
rest
betty
yes
she
would
go
to
her
room
she
said
some
new
books
had
arrived
from
london
this
morning
and
she
would
look
over
them
she
talked
a
little
about
her
visits
before
she
went
and
when
as
she
talked
ughtred
came
over
to
her
and
stood
close
to
her
side
holding
her
hand
and
stroking
it
she
smiled
at
him
sweetly
the
smile
he
adored
he
stroked
the
hand
and
softly
patted
it
watching
her
wistfully
suddenly
he
lifted
it
to
his
lips
and
kissed
it
again
and
again
with
a
sort
of
passion
i
love
you
so
much
aunt
betty
he
cried
we
both
love
you
so
much
something
makes
me
love
you
more
than
ever
i
did
before
it
almost
makes
me
cry
i
love
you
she
stooped
swiftly
and
drew
him
into
her
arms
and
kissed
him
close
and
hard
he
held
his
head
back
a
little
and
looked
into
the
blue
under
her
lashes
i
love
your
eyes
he
said
anyone
would
love
your
eyes
aunt
betty
but
what
is
the
matter
with
them
you
are
not
crying
at
all
but
oh
what
is
the
matter
no
i
am
not
crying
at
all
she
said
and
smiled
almost
laughed
but
after
she
had
kissed
him
again
she
took
her
books
and
went
upstairs
she
did
not
lie
down
and
she
did
not
read
when
she
was
alone
in
her
room
she
drew
a
long
chair
before
the
window
and
watched
the
slow
falling
of
the
rain
there
is
nothing
like
it
that
slow
weeping
of
the
rain
on
an
english
autumn
day
soft
and
light
though
it
was
the
park
began
to
look
sodden
the
bare
trees
held
out
their
branches
like
imploring
arms
the
brown
garden
beds
were
neat
and
bare
the
same
rain
was
at
mount
dunstan
upon
the
desolate
great
house
upon
the
village
upon
the
mounds
and
ancient
stone
tombs
in
the
churchyard
sinking
into
the
earth
sinking
deep
sucked
in
by
the
clay
beneath
the
cold
damp
clay
she
shook
herself
shudderingly
why
should
the
thought
come
to
her
the
cold
damp
clay
she
would
not
listen
to
it
she
would
think
of
new
york
of
its
roaring
streets
and
crash
of
sound
of
the
rush
of
fierce
life
there
of
her
father
and
mother
she
tried
to
force
herself
to
call
up
pictures
of
broadway
swarming
with
crowds
of
black
things
which
seen
from
the
windows
of
its
monstrous
buildings
seemed
like
swarms
of
ants
burst
out
of
out
of
a
thousand
she
tried
to
remember
shop
windows
the
things
in
them
the
throngs
going
by
and
the
throngs
passing
in
and
out
of
great
swinging
glass
doors
she
dragged
up
before
her
a
vision
of
rosalie
driving
with
her
mother
and
herself
looking
about
her
at
the
new
buildings
and
changed
streets
flushed
and
made
radiant
by
the
accelerated
pace
and
excitement
of
her
beloved
new
york
but
oh
the
slow
penetrating
rainfall
and
the
cold
damp
clay
she
rose
making
an
involuntary
sound
which
was
half
a
moan
the
long
mirror
set
between
two
windows
showed
her
momentarily
an
awful
young
figure
throwing
up
its
arms
was
that
betty
vanderpoel
that
what
does
one
do
she
said
when
the
world
comes
to
an
end
what
does
one
do
all
her
days
she
had
done
things
there
had
always
been
something
to
do
now
there
was
nothing
she
went
suddenly
to
her
bell
and
rang
for
her
maid
the
woman
answered
the
summons
at
once
send
word
to
the
stable
that
i
want
childe
harold
i
do
not
want
mason
i
shall
ride
yes
miss
ambleston
answered
without
any
exterior
sign
of
emotion
she
was
too
a
person
to
express
any
shade
of
her
internal
amazement
after
she
had
transmitted
the
order
to
the
proper
manager
she
returned
and
changed
her
mistress
costume
she
had
contemplated
her
task
and
was
standing
behind
miss
chair
putting
the
last
touch
to
her
veil
when
she
became
conscious
of
a
slight
stiffening
of
the
neck
which
held
so
well
the
handsome
head
then
the
head
slowly
turned
towards
the
window
giving
upon
the
front
park
miss
vanderpoel
was
listening
to
something
listening
so
intently
that
ambleston
felt
that
for
a
few
moments
she
did
not
seem
to
breathe
the
maid
hands
fell
from
the
veil
and
she
began
to
listen
also
she
had
been
at
the
service
the
day
before
miss
vanderpoel
rose
from
her
chair
slowly
very
slowly
and
took
a
step
forward
then
she
stood
still
and
listened
again
open
that
window
if
you
please
she
commanded
as
if
a
stone
image
was
speaking
ambleston
said
later
the
window
was
thrown
open
and
for
a
few
seconds
they
both
stood
still
again
when
miss
vanderpoel
spoke
it
was
as
if
she
had
forgotten
where
she
was
or
as
if
she
were
in
a
dream
it
is
the
ringers
she
said
they
are
tolling
the
passing
the
serving
woman
was
soft
of
heart
and
had
her
feminine
emotions
there
had
been
much
talk
of
this
thing
in
the
servant
hall
she
turned
upon
betty
and
forgot
all
rules
and
training
oh
miss
she
cried
he
gone
he
gone
that
good
man
out
of
this
hard
world
oh
miss
excuse
me
do
and
as
she
burst
into
wild
tears
she
ran
out
of
the
room
rosalie
had
been
sitting
in
the
morning
room
she
also
had
striven
to
occupy
herself
with
work
she
had
written
to
her
mother
she
had
read
she
had
embroidered
and
then
read
again
what
was
betty
doing
what
was
she
thinking
now
she
laid
her
book
down
in
her
lap
and
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
breathed
a
desperate
little
prayer
that
life
should
be
pain
and
emptiness
to
herself
seemed
somehow
natural
since
she
had
married
nigel
but
pain
and
emptiness
for
betty
no
no
no
not
for
betty
piteous
sorrow
poured
upon
her
like
a
flood
she
did
not
know
how
the
time
passed
she
sat
huddled
together
in
her
chair
with
hidden
face
she
could
not
bear
to
look
at
the
rain
and
ghost
mist
out
of
doors
oh
if
her
mother
were
only
here
and
she
might
speak
to
her
and
as
her
loving
tears
broke
forth
afresh
she
heard
the
door
open
if
you
please
my
lady
i
beg
your
pardon
my
lady
as
she
started
and
uncovered
her
face
what
is
it
jennings
the
figure
at
the
door
was
that
of
the
serious
elderly
butler
and
he
wore
a
respectfully
grave
air
as
your
ladyship
is
sitting
in
this
room
we
thought
it
likely
you
would
not
hear
the
windows
being
closed
and
we
felt
sure
my
lady
that
you
would
wish
to
know
lady
anstruthers
hands
shook
as
they
clung
to
the
arms
of
her
chair
to
know
she
faltered
hear
what
the
passing
bell
is
tolling
my
lady
it
has
just
begun
it
is
for
lord
mount
dunstan
there
not
a
dry
eye
downstairs
your
ladyship
not
he
opened
the
windows
and
she
stood
up
jennings
quietly
left
the
room
the
slow
heavy
knell
struck
ponderously
on
the
damp
air
and
she
stood
and
shivered
a
moment
or
two
later
she
turned
because
it
seemed
as
if
she
must
betty
in
her
riding
habit
was
standing
motionless
against
the
door
her
wonderful
eyes
still
as
death
gazing
at
her
gazing
in
an
awful
simple
silence
oh
what
was
the
use
of
being
afraid
to
speak
at
such
a
time
as
this
in
one
moment
rosy
was
kneeling
at
her
feet
clinging
about
her
knees
kissing
her
hands
the
very
cloth
of
her
habit
and
sobbing
aloud
oh
my
darling
my
love
my
own
betty
i
do
know
and
i
ask
but
speak
to
me
speak
just
a
word
my
dearest
dear
betty
raised
her
up
and
drew
her
within
the
room
closing
the
door
behind
them
kind
little
rosy
she
said
i
came
to
speak
because
we
two
love
each
other
you
need
not
ask
i
will
tell
you
that
bell
is
tolling
for
the
man
who
taught
me
to
know
he
never
spoke
to
me
of
love
i
have
not
one
word
or
look
to
remember
and
now
oh
listen
listen
i
have
been
listening
since
the
morning
of
it
was
an
awful
thing
her
white
face
with
all
the
flame
of
life
swept
out
of
it
do
listen
darling
darling
rosy
cried
out
in
anguish
shut
your
ears
shut
your
ears
and
she
tried
to
throw
her
arms
around
the
high
black
head
and
stifle
all
sound
with
her
embrace
i
do
want
to
shut
them
was
the
answer
all
the
unkindness
and
misery
are
over
for
him
i
ought
to
thank
god
but
i
do
i
shall
hear
o
rosy
listen
i
shall
hear
that
to
the
end
of
my
rosy
held
her
tight
and
rocked
and
sobbed
my
betty
she
kept
saying
my
betty
and
she
could
say
no
more
what
more
was
there
to
say
at
last
betty
withdrew
herself
from
her
arms
and
then
rosalie
noticed
for
the
first
time
that
she
wore
the
habit
dearest
she
whispered
what
are
you
going
to
do
i
was
going
to
ride
and
i
am
going
to
do
it
still
i
must
do
something
i
shall
ride
a
long
long
way
and
ride
hard
you
wo
try
to
keep
me
rosy
you
will
yes
biting
her
lip
and
looking
at
her
with
large
awed
eyes
as
she
patted
her
arm
with
a
hand
that
trembled
i
would
not
hold
you
back
betty
from
anything
in
the
world
you
chose
to
and
with
another
long
clinging
clasp
of
her
she
let
her
go
mason
was
standing
by
childe
harold
when
she
went
down
the
broad
steps
he
also
wore
a
look
of
repressed
emotion
and
stood
with
bared
head
bent
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
gravel
of
the
drive
listening
to
the
heavy
strokes
of
the
bell
in
the
church
tower
rather
as
if
he
were
taking
part
in
some
solemn
ceremony
he
mounted
her
silently
and
after
he
had
given
her
the
bridle
looked
up
and
spoke
in
a
somewhat
husky
voice
the
order
was
that
you
did
not
want
me
miss
was
that
correct
yes
i
wish
to
ride
yes
miss
thank
you
childe
harold
was
in
good
spirits
he
held
up
his
head
and
blew
the
breath
through
his
delicate
dilated
red
nostrils
as
he
set
out
with
his
favourite
sidling
dancing
steps
mason
watched
him
down
the
avenue
saw
the
lodge
keeper
come
out
to
open
the
gate
and
curtsy
as
her
ladyship
sister
passed
through
it
after
that
he
went
slowly
back
to
the
stables
and
sat
in
the
a
long
time
staring
at
the
floor
as
the
bell
struck
ponderously
on
his
ear
the
woman
who
had
opened
the
gate
for
her
betty
saw
had
red
eyes
she
knew
why
a
year
ago
they
all
thought
of
him
as
an
outcast
they
would
have
believed
any
evil
they
had
heard
connected
with
his
name
now
in
every
cottage
there
is
weeping
weeping
and
he
lies
deaf
and
dumb
was
her
thought
she
did
not
wish
to
pass
through
the
village
and
turned
down
a
side
road
which
would
lead
her
to
where
she
could
cross
the
marshes
and
come
upon
lonely
places
the
more
lonely
the
better
every
few
moments
she
caught
her
breath
with
a
hard
short
gasp
the
slow
rain
fell
upon
her
big
round
crystal
drops
hung
on
the
hedgerows
and
dripped
upon
the
grass
banks
below
them
the
trees
wreathed
with
mist
were
like
waiting
ghosts
as
she
passed
them
by
childe
harold
hoof
upon
the
road
made
a
hollow
lonely
sound
a
thought
began
to
fill
her
brain
and
make
insistent
pressure
upon
it
she
tried
no
more
to
thrust
thought
away
those
who
lay
deaf
and
dumb
those
for
whom
people
wept
where
were
they
when
the
weeping
seemed
to
sound
through
all
the
world
how
far
had
they
gone
was
it
far
could
they
hear
and
could
they
see
if
one
plead
with
them
aloud
could
they
draw
near
to
listen
did
they
begin
a
long
long
journey
as
soon
as
they
had
slipped
away
the
wonder
of
the
world
she
had
said
watching
life
swelling
and
bursting
the
seeds
in
kedgers
hothouses
but
this
was
a
greater
wonder
still
because
of
its
awesomeness
this
man
had
been
and
who
dare
say
he
was
not
even
now
the
strength
of
his
great
body
the
look
in
his
eyes
the
sound
of
his
deep
voice
the
struggle
the
meaning
of
him
where
were
they
she
heard
herself
followed
by
the
hollow
echo
of
childe
harold
hoofs
as
she
rode
past
copse
and
hedge
and
wet
spreading
fields
she
was
this
hour
as
he
had
been
a
month
ago
if
with
some
strange
suddenness
this
which
was
betty
vanderpoel
slipped
from
its
body
she
put
her
hand
up
to
her
forehead
it
was
unthinkable
that
there
would
be
no
more
where
was
he
now
where
was
he
now
this
was
the
thought
that
filled
her
brain
cells
to
the
exclusion
of
all
others
over
the
road
down
through
out
on
the
marshes
where
was
he
where
was
he
where
childe
harold
hoofs
began
to
beat
it
out
as
a
refrain
she
heard
nothing
else
she
did
not
know
where
she
was
going
and
did
not
ask
herself
she
went
down
any
road
or
lane
which
looked
empty
of
life
she
took
strange
turnings
without
caring
she
did
not
know
how
far
she
was
afield
where
was
he
now
this
hour
this
moment
where
was
he
now
did
he
know
the
rain
the
greyness
the
desolation
of
the
world
once
she
stopped
her
horse
on
the
loneliness
of
the
marsh
land
and
looked
up
at
the
low
clouds
about
her
at
the
creeping
mist
the
dank
grass
it
seemed
a
place
in
which
a
soul
might
wander
because
it
did
not
yet
know
its
way
if
you
should
be
near
and
come
to
me
you
will
understand
her
clear
voice
said
gravely
between
the
caught
breaths
what
i
gave
you
was
nothing
to
you
but
you
took
it
with
you
perhaps
you
know
without
my
telling
you
i
want
you
to
know
when
a
man
is
dead
everything
melts
away
i
loved
you
i
wish
you
had
loved
chapter
xlviii
the
moment
in
the
unnatural
unbearableness
of
her
anguish
she
lost
sight
of
objects
as
she
passed
them
she
lost
all
memory
of
what
she
did
she
did
not
know
how
long
she
had
been
out
or
how
far
she
had
ridden
when
the
thought
of
time
or
distance
vaguely
flitted
across
her
mind
it
seemed
that
she
had
been
riding
for
hours
and
might
have
crossed
one
county
and
entered
another
she
had
long
left
familiar
places
behind
riding
through
and
inclosed
by
the
mist
she
herself
might
have
been
a
wandering
ghost
lost
in
unknown
places
where
was
he
now
where
was
he
now
afterwards
she
could
not
tell
how
or
when
it
was
that
she
found
herself
becoming
conscious
of
the
evidences
that
her
horse
had
been
ridden
too
long
and
hard
and
that
he
was
worn
out
with
fatigue
she
did
not
know
that
she
had
ridden
round
and
round
over
the
marshes
and
had
passed
several
times
through
the
same
lanes
childe
harold
the
sure
of
foot
actually
stumbled
out
of
sheer
weariness
of
limb
perhaps
it
was
this
which
brought
her
back
to
earth
and
led
her
to
look
around
her
with
eyes
which
saw
material
objects
with
comprehension
she
had
reached
the
lonely
places
indeed
and
the
evening
was
drawing
on
she
was
at
the
edge
of
the
marsh
and
the
land
about
her
was
strange
to
her
and
desolate
at
the
side
of
a
steep
lane
overgrown
with
grass
and
seeming
a
mere
stood
a
black
and
white
timbered
cottage
which
was
half
a
ruin
close
to
it
was
a
dripping
spinney
its
trees
forming
a
darkling
background
to
the
house
whose
thatch
was
rotting
into
holes
and
its
walls
sagging
forward
perilously
the
bit
of
garden
about
it
was
neglected
and
untidy
here
and
there
windows
were
broken
and
stuffed
with
pieces
of
ragged
garments
altogether
a
sinister
and
repellent
place
enough
she
looked
at
it
with
heavy
eyes
where
was
he
now
where
was
he
now
this
repeating
itself
in
the
far
chambers
of
her
brain
her
sight
seemed
dimmed
not
only
by
the
mist
but
by
a
sinking
faintness
which
possessed
her
she
did
not
remember
how
little
food
she
had
eaten
during
more
than
hours
her
habit
was
heavy
with
moisture
and
clung
to
her
body
she
was
conscious
of
a
hot
tremor
passing
over
her
and
saw
that
her
hands
shook
as
they
held
the
bridle
on
which
they
had
lost
their
grip
she
had
never
fainted
in
her
life
and
she
was
not
going
to
faint
now
women
did
not
faint
in
these
days
but
she
must
reach
the
cottage
and
dismount
to
rest
under
shelter
for
a
short
time
no
smoke
was
rising
from
the
chimney
but
surely
someone
was
living
in
the
place
and
could
tell
her
where
she
was
and
give
her
at
least
water
for
herself
and
her
horse
poor
beast
how
wickedly
she
must
have
been
riding
him
in
her
utter
absorption
in
her
thoughts
he
was
wet
not
alone
with
rain
but
with
sweat
he
snorted
out
hot
smoking
breaths
she
spoke
to
him
and
he
moved
forward
at
her
command
he
was
trembling
too
not
more
than
two
hundred
yards
and
she
turned
him
into
the
lane
but
it
was
wet
and
slippery
and
strewn
with
stones
his
trembling
and
her
uncertain
hold
on
the
bridle
combined
to
produce
disaster
he
set
his
foot
upon
a
stone
which
slid
beneath
it
he
stumbled
and
she
could
not
help
him
to
recover
so
he
fell
and
only
by
heaven
mercy
not
upon
her
with
his
crushing
weight
and
she
was
able
to
drag
herself
free
of
him
before
he
began
to
kick
in
his
humiliated
efforts
to
rise
but
he
could
not
rise
because
he
was
hurt
and
when
she
herself
got
up
she
staggered
and
caught
at
the
broken
gate
because
in
her
wrenching
leap
for
safety
she
had
twisted
her
ankle
and
for
a
moment
was
in
cruel
pain
when
she
recovered
from
her
shock
sufficiently
to
be
able
to
look
at
the
cottage
she
saw
that
it
was
more
of
a
ruin
than
it
had
seemed
even
at
a
short
distance
its
door
hung
open
on
broken
hinges
no
smoke
rose
from
the
chimney
because
there
was
no
one
within
its
walls
to
light
a
fire
it
was
quite
empty
everything
about
the
place
lay
in
dead
and
utter
silence
in
a
normal
mood
she
would
have
liked
the
mystery
of
the
situation
and
would
have
set
about
planning
her
way
out
of
her
difficulty
but
now
her
mind
made
no
effort
because
normal
interest
in
things
had
fallen
away
from
her
she
might
be
twenty
miles
from
stornham
but
the
possible
fact
did
not
at
the
moment
seem
to
concern
her
where
is
he
now
where
is
he
now
childe
harold
was
trying
to
rise
despite
his
hurt
and
his
evident
determination
touched
her
he
was
too
proud
to
lie
in
the
mire
she
limped
to
him
and
tried
to
steady
him
by
his
bridle
he
was
not
badly
injured
though
plainly
in
pain
poor
boy
it
was
my
fault
she
said
to
him
as
he
at
last
struggled
to
his
feet
i
did
not
know
i
was
doing
it
poor
boy
he
turned
a
velvet
dark
eye
upon
her
and
nosed
her
forgivingly
with
a
warm
velvet
muzzle
but
it
was
plain
that
for
the
time
he
was
done
for
they
both
moved
haltingly
to
the
broken
gate
and
betty
fastened
him
to
a
thorn
tree
near
it
where
he
stood
on
three
feet
his
fine
head
drooping
she
pushed
the
gate
open
and
went
into
the
house
through
the
door
which
hung
on
its
hinges
once
inside
she
stood
still
and
looked
about
her
if
there
was
silence
and
desolateness
outside
there
was
within
the
deserted
place
a
stillness
like
the
unresponse
of
death
it
had
been
long
since
anyone
had
lived
in
the
cottage
but
tramps
or
gipsies
had
at
times
passed
through
it
dead
blackened
embers
lay
on
the
hearth
a
bundle
of
dried
grass
which
had
been
slept
on
was
piled
in
the
corner
an
empty
nail
keg
and
a
wooden
box
had
been
drawn
before
the
big
chimney
place
for
some
wanderer
to
sit
on
when
the
black
embers
had
been
hot
and
red
betty
gave
one
glance
around
her
and
sat
down
upon
the
box
standing
on
the
bare
hearth
her
head
sinking
forward
her
hands
falling
clasped
between
her
knees
her
eyes
on
the
brick
floor
where
is
he
now
broke
from
her
in
a
loud
whisper
whose
sound
was
mechanical
and
hollow
where
is
he
now
and
she
sat
there
without
moving
while
the
grey
mist
from
the
marshes
crept
close
about
the
door
and
through
it
and
stole
about
her
feet
so
she
sat
long
long
in
a
heavy
dream
along
the
road
a
man
was
riding
with
a
lowering
fretted
face
he
had
come
across
country
on
horseback
because
to
travel
by
train
meant
wearisome
stops
and
changes
and
endlessly
slow
journeying
annoying
beyond
endurance
to
those
who
have
not
patience
to
spare
his
ride
would
have
been
pleasant
enough
but
for
the
slow
rain
also
he
had
taken
a
wrong
turning
because
he
did
not
know
the
roads
he
travelled
the
last
signpost
he
had
passed
however
had
given
him
his
cue
again
and
he
began
to
feel
something
of
security
confound
the
rain
the
best
road
was
slippery
with
it
and
the
haze
of
it
made
a
man
mind
feel
befogged
and
lowered
his
spirits
horribly
discouraged
him
would
worry
him
into
an
ill
humour
even
if
he
had
reason
to
be
in
a
good
one
as
for
him
he
had
no
reason
for
cheerfulness
he
never
had
for
the
matter
of
that
and
just
now
what
was
the
matter
with
his
horse
he
was
lifting
his
head
and
sniffing
the
damp
air
restlessly
as
if
he
scented
or
saw
something
beasts
often
seemed
to
have
a
sort
of
second
sight
horses
particularly
what
ailed
him
that
he
should
prick
up
his
ears
and
snort
after
his
sniffing
the
mist
did
he
hear
anything
yes
he
did
it
seemed
he
gave
forth
suddenly
a
loud
shrill
whinny
turning
his
head
towards
a
rough
lane
they
were
approaching
and
immediately
from
the
vicinity
of
a
cottage
behind
a
hedge
came
a
sharp
but
neigh
in
answer
what
horse
is
that
said
nigel
anstruthers
drawing
in
at
the
entrance
to
the
lane
and
looking
down
it
there
is
a
fine
brute
with
a
on
he
added
sharply
he
is
waiting
for
someone
what
is
a
woman
doing
there
at
this
time
is
it
a
rendezvous
a
good
place
he
broke
off
short
and
rode
forward
i
hanged
if
it
is
not
childe
harold
he
broke
out
and
he
had
no
sooner
assured
himself
of
the
fact
than
he
threw
himself
from
his
saddle
tethered
his
horse
and
strode
up
the
path
to
the
door
he
stood
on
the
threshold
and
stared
what
a
hole
it
was
what
a
hole
and
there
she
sat
alone
eighteen
or
twenty
miles
from
home
on
a
box
near
the
black
embers
her
hands
clasped
loosely
between
her
knees
her
face
rather
awful
her
eyes
staring
at
the
floor
as
if
she
did
not
see
it
where
is
he
now
he
heard
her
whisper
to
herself
with
soft
weirdness
where
is
he
now
sir
nigel
stepped
into
the
place
and
stood
before
her
he
had
smiled
with
a
wry
unpleasantness
when
he
had
heard
her
evidently
unconscious
words
my
good
girl
he
said
i
am
sure
i
do
not
know
where
he
is
but
it
is
very
evident
that
he
ought
to
be
here
since
you
have
amiably
put
yourself
to
such
trouble
it
is
fortunate
for
you
perhaps
that
i
am
here
before
him
what
does
this
mean
the
question
breaking
from
him
with
savage
authority
he
had
dragged
her
back
to
earth
she
sat
upright
and
recognised
him
with
a
hideous
sense
of
shock
but
he
did
not
give
her
time
to
speak
his
instinct
of
male
fury
leaped
within
him
you
he
cried
out
it
takes
a
woman
like
you
to
come
and
hide
herself
in
a
place
of
this
sort
like
a
trolloping
gipsy
wench
it
takes
a
new
york
millionairess
or
a
roman
empress
or
one
of
charles
the
second
duchesses
to
plunge
as
deep
as
this
you
with
your
golden
pedestal
you
with
your
ostentatious
airs
and
graces
you
with
your
condescending
to
give
a
man
a
chance
to
repent
his
sins
and
turn
over
a
new
leaf
damn
it
rising
to
a
sort
of
frenzy
what
are
you
doing
waiting
in
a
hole
like
this
in
this
weather
at
this
hour
you
you
the
fool
flame
leaped
high
enough
to
make
him
start
forward
as
if
to
seize
her
by
the
shoulder
and
shake
her
but
she
rose
and
stepped
back
to
lean
against
the
side
of
the
chimney
to
brace
herself
against
it
so
that
she
could
stand
in
her
lame
foot
despite
every
drop
of
blood
had
been
swept
from
her
face
and
her
eyes
looked
immense
his
coming
was
a
good
thing
for
her
though
she
did
not
know
it
it
brought
her
back
from
unearthly
places
all
her
child
hatred
woke
and
blazed
in
her
never
had
she
hated
a
thing
so
and
it
set
her
slow
cold
blood
running
like
something
molten
hold
your
tongue
she
said
in
a
clear
awful
young
voice
of
warning
and
take
care
not
to
touch
me
if
you
do
i
have
my
whip
here
i
shall
lash
you
across
your
mouth
he
broke
into
ribald
laughter
a
certain
sudden
thought
which
had
cut
into
him
like
a
knife
thrust
into
flesh
drove
him
on
do
he
cried
i
should
like
to
carry
your
mark
back
to
stornham
and
tell
people
why
it
was
given
i
know
who
you
are
here
for
only
such
fellows
ask
such
things
of
women
but
he
was
determined
to
be
safe
if
you
hid
in
a
ditch
you
are
here
for
mount
dunstan
and
he
has
failed
you
but
she
only
stood
and
stared
at
him
holding
her
whip
behind
her
knowing
that
at
any
moment
he
might
snatch
it
from
her
hand
and
she
knew
how
poor
a
weapon
it
was
to
strike
out
with
it
would
only
infuriate
him
and
make
him
a
wild
beast
and
it
was
becoming
an
agony
to
stand
upon
her
foot
and
even
if
it
had
not
been
so
if
she
had
been
strong
enough
to
make
a
leap
and
dash
past
him
her
horse
stood
outside
disabled
nigel
anstruthers
eyes
ran
over
her
from
head
to
foot
down
the
side
of
her
habit
while
a
curious
light
dawned
in
them
you
have
had
a
fall
from
your
horse
he
exclaimed
you
are
lame
then
quickly
that
was
why
childe
harold
was
trembling
and
standing
on
three
feet
by
jove
then
he
sat
down
on
the
nail
keg
and
began
to
laugh
he
laughed
for
a
full
minute
but
she
saw
he
did
not
take
his
eyes
from
her
you
are
in
as
unpleasant
a
situation
as
a
young
woman
can
well
be
he
said
when
he
stopped
you
came
to
a
dirty
hole
to
be
alone
with
a
man
who
felt
it
safest
not
to
keep
his
appointment
your
horse
stumbled
and
disabled
himself
and
you
you
are
twenty
miles
from
home
in
a
deserted
cottage
in
a
lane
no
one
passes
down
even
in
good
weather
you
are
frightened
to
death
and
you
have
given
me
even
a
better
story
to
play
with
than
your
sister
gave
me
by
jove
his
face
was
an
unholy
thing
to
look
upon
the
situation
and
her
powerlessness
were
exciting
him
no
she
answered
keeping
her
eyes
on
his
as
she
might
have
kept
them
on
some
wild
animal
i
am
not
frightened
to
his
ugly
dark
flush
rose
well
if
you
are
not
he
said
do
tell
me
so
that
kind
of
defiance
is
not
your
best
line
just
now
you
have
been
disdaining
me
from
magnificent
new
york
heights
for
some
time
do
you
think
that
i
am
not
enjoying
this
i
can
not
imagine
anyone
else
who
would
enjoy
it
so
and
she
knew
the
answer
was
daring
but
would
have
made
it
if
he
had
held
a
point
at
her
throat
he
got
up
and
walking
to
the
door
drew
it
back
on
its
crazy
hinges
and
managed
to
shut
it
close
there
was
a
big
wooden
bolt
inside
and
he
forced
it
into
its
socket
presently
i
shall
go
and
put
the
horses
into
the
cowshed
he
said
if
i
leave
them
standing
outside
they
will
attract
attention
i
do
not
intend
to
be
disturbed
by
any
gipsy
tramp
who
wants
shelter
i
have
never
had
you
quite
to
myself
he
sat
down
again
and
nursed
his
knee
gracefully
and
i
have
never
seen
you
look
as
attractive
biting
his
under
lip
in
cynical
enjoyment
adventure
has
roused
your
emotions
and
actually
beautified
you
which
was
not
necessary
i
daresay
you
have
been
furious
and
have
cried
your
eyes
do
not
look
like
mere
eyes
but
like
splendid
blue
pools
of
tears
perhaps
shall
make
you
cry
sometime
my
dear
no
you
will
do
tempt
me
women
always
cry
when
men
annoy
them
they
rage
but
they
cry
as
i
shall
it
true
that
most
women
would
have
begun
to
cry
before
this
that
is
what
stimulates
me
you
will
swagger
to
the
end
you
put
the
devil
into
me
half
an
hour
ago
i
was
jogging
along
the
road
languid
and
bored
to
extinction
and
now
he
laughed
outright
in
actual
exultation
by
jove
he
cried
out
things
like
this
do
happen
to
a
man
in
these
dull
days
there
no
such
luck
going
about
we
gone
back
five
hundred
years
and
we
taken
new
york
with
his
laugh
shut
off
in
the
middle
and
he
got
up
to
thrust
his
heavy
congested
face
close
to
hers
here
you
are
as
safe
as
if
you
were
in
a
feudal
castle
and
here
is
your
ancient
enemy
given
his
chance
given
his
chance
do
you
think
by
the
lord
he
is
going
to
give
it
up
no
to
quote
your
own
words
may
place
entire
confidence
in
that
exaggerated
as
it
all
was
somehow
the
melodrama
dropped
away
from
it
and
left
bare
simple
hideous
fact
for
her
to
confront
the
evil
in
him
had
risen
rampant
and
made
him
lose
his
head
he
might
see
his
senseless
folly
and
know
he
must
pay
for
it
but
he
would
not
see
it
the
place
was
not
a
feudal
castle
but
what
he
said
was
insurmountable
truth
a
ruined
cottage
on
the
edge
of
miles
of
marsh
land
a
road
and
night
upon
them
a
wind
was
rising
on
the
marshes
now
and
making
low
steady
moan
horrible
things
had
happened
to
women
before
one
heard
of
them
with
shudders
when
they
were
recorded
in
the
newspapers
only
two
days
ago
she
had
remembered
that
sometimes
there
seemed
blunderings
in
the
great
scheme
of
things
was
all
this
real
or
was
she
dreaming
that
she
stood
here
at
bay
her
back
against
the
and
this
degenerate
exulting
over
her
while
rosy
was
waiting
for
her
at
stornham
and
at
this
very
hour
her
father
was
planning
his
journey
across
the
atlantic
why
did
you
not
behave
yourself
demanded
nigel
anstruthers
shaking
her
by
the
shoulder
why
did
you
not
realise
that
i
should
get
even
with
you
one
day
as
sure
as
you
were
woman
and
i
was
man
she
did
not
shrink
back
though
the
pupils
of
her
eyes
dilated
was
it
the
wildest
thing
in
the
world
which
happened
to
her
or
was
it
not
without
warning
the
sudden
rush
of
a
thought
immense
and
strange
swept
over
her
body
and
soul
and
possessed
her
so
possessed
her
that
it
changed
her
pallor
to
white
flame
it
was
actually
anstruthers
who
shrank
back
a
shade
because
for
the
moment
she
looked
so
near
unearthly
i
am
not
afraid
of
you
she
said
in
a
clear
unshaken
voice
i
am
not
afraid
something
is
near
me
which
will
stand
between
us
something
which
died
he
almost
gasped
before
the
strangeness
of
it
but
caught
back
his
breath
and
recovered
himself
died
that
recent
enough
he
jeered
let
us
hear
about
it
who
was
it
it
was
mount
dunstan
she
flung
at
him
the
were
tolling
for
him
when
i
rode
away
i
could
not
stay
to
hear
them
it
killed
me
i
loved
him
you
were
right
when
you
said
it
i
loved
him
though
he
never
knew
i
shall
always
love
him
though
he
never
knew
he
knows
now
those
who
died
can
not
go
away
when
that
is
holding
them
they
must
stay
because
i
loved
him
he
may
be
in
this
place
i
call
on
him
raising
her
clear
voice
i
call
on
him
to
stand
between
he
backed
away
from
her
staring
an
evil
enraptured
stare
what
there
is
that
much
temperament
in
you
he
said
that
was
what
i
when
i
saw
you
first
but
you
have
hidden
it
well
now
it
bursts
forth
in
spite
of
you
good
lord
what
luck
what
luck
he
moved
to
the
door
and
opened
it
i
am
a
very
modern
man
and
i
enjoy
this
to
the
utmost
he
said
what
i
like
best
is
the
melodrama
of
it
in
connection
with
fifth
avenue
i
am
perfectly
aware
that
you
will
not
discuss
this
incident
in
the
future
you
are
a
clever
enough
young
woman
to
know
that
it
will
be
more
to
your
interest
than
to
mine
that
it
shall
be
kept
exceedingly
the
white
fire
had
not
died
out
of
her
and
she
stood
straight
what
i
have
called
on
will
be
near
me
and
will
stand
between
us
she
said
old
though
it
was
the
door
was
massive
and
heavy
to
lift
to
open
it
cost
him
some
muscular
effort
i
am
going
to
the
horses
now
he
explained
before
he
dragged
it
back
into
its
frame
and
shut
her
in
it
is
safe
enough
to
leave
you
here
you
will
stay
where
you
he
felt
himself
secure
in
leaving
her
because
he
believed
she
could
not
move
and
because
his
arrogance
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
count
on
strength
and
endurance
greater
than
his
own
of
endurance
he
knew
nothing
and
in
his
keen
and
cynical
exultance
his
devil
made
a
fool
of
him
as
she
heard
him
walk
down
the
path
to
the
gate
betty
stood
amazed
at
his
lack
of
comprehension
of
her
he
thinks
i
will
stay
here
he
absolutely
thinks
i
will
wait
until
he
comes
back
she
whispered
to
the
emptiness
of
the
bare
room
before
he
had
arrived
she
had
loosened
her
boot
and
now
she
stooped
and
touched
her
foot
if
i
were
safe
at
home
i
should
think
i
could
not
walk
but
i
can
walk
now
i
can
i
can
because
i
will
bear
the
in
such
cottages
there
is
always
a
door
opening
outside
from
the
little
bricked
kitchen
where
the
copper
stands
she
would
reach
that
and
passing
through
would
close
it
behind
her
after
that
something
would
tell
her
what
to
do
something
would
lead
her
she
put
her
lame
foot
upon
the
floor
and
rested
some
of
her
weight
upon
it
not
all
a
jagged
pain
shot
up
from
it
through
her
whole
side
it
seemed
and
for
an
instant
she
swayed
and
ground
her
teeth
that
is
because
it
is
the
first
step
she
said
but
if
i
am
to
be
killed
i
will
die
in
the
open
i
will
die
in
the
the
second
and
third
steps
brought
cold
sweat
out
upon
her
but
she
told
herself
that
the
fourth
was
not
quite
so
unbearable
and
she
stiffened
her
whole
body
and
muttered
some
words
while
she
took
a
fifth
and
sixth
which
carried
her
into
the
tiny
back
kitchen
father
she
said
father
think
of
me
now
think
of
me
rosy
love
me
love
me
and
pray
that
i
may
come
home
you
you
who
have
died
stand
very
near
if
her
father
ever
held
her
safe
in
his
arms
again
if
she
ever
awoke
from
this
nightmare
it
would
be
a
thing
never
to
let
one
mind
hark
back
to
again
to
shut
out
of
memory
with
iron
doors
the
pain
had
shot
up
and
down
and
her
forehead
was
wet
by
the
time
she
had
reached
the
small
back
door
was
it
locked
or
bolted
was
it
she
put
her
hand
gently
upon
the
latch
and
lifted
it
without
making
any
sound
thank
god
almighty
it
was
neither
bolted
nor
locked
the
latch
lifted
the
door
opened
and
she
slid
through
it
into
the
shadow
of
the
grey
which
was
already
almost
the
darkness
of
night
thank
god
for
that
too
she
flattened
herself
against
the
outside
wall
and
listened
he
was
having
difficulty
in
managing
childe
harold
who
snorted
and
pulled
back
offended
and
made
rebellious
by
his
savagely
impatient
hand
good
childe
harold
good
boy
she
could
see
the
massed
outline
of
the
trees
of
the
spinney
if
she
could
bear
this
long
enough
to
get
there
even
if
she
crawled
part
of
the
way
then
it
darted
through
her
mind
that
he
would
guess
that
she
would
be
sure
to
make
for
its
cover
and
that
he
would
go
there
first
to
search
father
think
for
me
you
were
so
quick
to
think
her
brain
cried
out
for
her
as
if
she
was
speaking
to
one
who
could
physically
hear
she
almost
feared
she
had
spoken
aloud
and
the
thought
which
flashed
upon
her
like
lightning
seemed
to
be
an
answer
given
he
would
be
convinced
that
she
would
at
once
try
to
get
away
from
the
house
if
she
kept
near
it
somewhere
somewhere
quite
close
and
let
him
search
the
spinney
she
might
get
away
to
its
cover
after
he
gave
up
the
search
and
came
back
the
jagged
pain
had
settled
in
a
sort
of
impossible
anguish
and
once
or
twice
she
felt
sick
but
she
would
die
in
the
open
and
she
knew
rosalie
was
frightened
by
her
absence
and
was
praying
for
her
prayers
counted
and
yet
they
had
all
prayed
yesterday
if
i
were
not
very
strong
i
should
faint
she
thought
but
i
have
been
strong
all
my
life
that
great
french
doctor
i
have
forgotten
his
name
said
that
i
had
the
physique
to
endure
she
said
these
things
that
she
might
gain
steadiness
and
convince
herself
that
she
was
not
merely
living
through
a
nightmare
twice
she
moved
her
foot
suddenly
because
she
found
herself
in
a
momentary
respite
from
pain
beginning
to
believe
that
the
thing
was
a
nightmare
that
nothing
mattered
because
she
would
wake
up
presently
so
she
need
not
try
to
hide
but
in
a
nightmare
one
has
no
pain
it
is
real
and
i
must
go
somewhere
she
said
after
the
foot
was
moved
where
could
she
go
she
had
not
looked
at
the
place
as
she
rode
up
she
had
only
seen
the
spinney
nigel
was
swearing
at
the
horses
having
got
childe
harold
into
the
shed
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
to
fasten
his
bridle
to
and
he
had
yet
to
bring
his
own
horse
in
and
secure
him
she
must
get
away
somewhere
before
the
delay
was
over
how
dark
it
was
growing
thank
god
for
that
again
what
was
the
rather
high
dark
object
she
could
trace
in
the
dimness
near
the
hedge
it
was
sharply
pointed
is
if
it
were
a
narrow
tent
her
heart
began
to
beat
like
a
drum
as
she
recalled
something
it
was
the
shape
of
the
sort
of
wigwam
structure
made
of
hop
poles
after
they
were
taken
from
the
fields
if
there
was
space
between
it
and
the
hedge
even
a
narrow
space
and
she
could
crouch
there
nigel
was
furious
because
childe
harold
was
backing
plunging
and
snorting
dangerously
she
halted
forward
shutting
her
teeth
in
her
terrible
pain
she
could
scarcely
see
and
did
not
recognise
that
near
the
wigwam
was
a
pile
of
hop
poles
laid
on
top
of
each
other
horizontally
it
was
not
quite
as
high
as
the
hedge
whose
dark
background
prevented
its
being
seen
only
a
few
steps
more
no
she
was
awake
in
a
nightmare
one
felt
only
terror
not
pain
you
who
died
she
murmured
she
saw
the
horizontal
poles
too
late
one
of
them
had
rolled
from
its
place
and
lay
on
the
ground
and
she
trod
on
it
was
thrown
forward
against
the
heap
and
in
her
blind
effort
to
recover
herself
slipped
and
fell
into
a
narrow
grassed
hollow
behind
it
clutching
at
the
hedge
the
great
french
doctor
had
not
been
quite
right
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
felt
herself
sinking
into
bottomless
darkness
which
was
what
happened
to
people
when
they
fainted
when
she
opened
her
eyes
she
could
see
nothing
because
on
one
side
of
her
rose
the
low
mass
of
the
hop
poles
and
on
the
other
was
the
hedge
which
had
thrown
out
a
thick
sheltering
growth
and
curved
above
her
like
a
penthouse
was
she
awakening
after
all
no
because
the
pain
was
awakening
with
her
and
she
could
hear
what
seemed
at
first
to
be
quite
loud
sounds
she
could
not
have
been
unconscious
long
for
she
almost
immediately
recognised
that
they
were
the
echo
of
a
man
hurried
footsteps
upon
the
bare
wooden
stairway
leading
to
the
bedrooms
in
the
empty
house
having
secured
the
horses
nigel
had
returned
to
the
cottage
and
finding
her
gone
had
rushed
to
the
upper
floor
in
search
of
her
he
was
calling
her
name
angrily
his
voice
resounding
in
the
emptiness
of
the
rooms
betty
do
play
the
fool
with
me
she
cautiously
drew
herself
further
under
cover
making
sure
that
no
end
of
her
habit
remained
in
sight
the
overgrowth
of
the
hedge
was
her
salvation
if
she
had
seen
the
spot
by
daylight
she
would
not
have
thought
it
a
possible
place
of
concealment
once
she
had
read
an
account
of
a
woman
frantic
flight
from
a
murderer
who
was
hunting
her
to
her
death
while
she
slipped
from
one
poor
hiding
place
to
another
sometimes
crouching
behind
walls
or
bushes
sometimes
lying
flat
in
long
grass
once
wading
through
a
stream
and
at
last
finding
a
miserable
little
fastness
where
she
hid
shivering
for
hours
until
her
enemy
gave
up
his
search
one
never
felt
the
reality
of
such
histories
but
there
was
actually
a
sort
of
parallel
in
this
mad
and
crude
things
were
let
loose
and
the
world
of
ordinary
life
seemed
thousands
of
miles
away
she
held
her
breath
for
he
was
leaving
the
house
by
the
front
door
she
heard
his
footsteps
on
the
bricked
path
and
then
in
the
lane
he
went
to
the
road
and
the
sound
of
his
feet
died
away
for
a
few
moments
then
she
heard
them
returning
he
was
back
in
the
lane
on
the
brick
path
and
stood
listening
or
perhaps
reflecting
he
muttered
something
exclamatory
and
she
heard
a
match
struck
and
shortly
afterwards
he
moved
across
the
garden
patch
towards
the
little
spinney
he
had
thought
of
it
as
she
had
believed
he
would
he
would
not
think
of
this
place
and
in
the
end
he
might
get
tired
or
awakened
to
a
sense
of
his
lurid
folly
and
realise
that
it
would
be
safer
for
him
to
go
back
to
stornham
with
some
clever
lie
trusting
to
his
belief
that
there
existed
no
girl
but
would
shrink
from
telling
such
a
story
in
connection
with
a
man
who
would
brazenly
deny
it
with
contemptuous
dramatic
detail
if
he
would
but
decide
on
this
she
would
be
safe
and
it
would
be
so
like
him
that
she
dared
to
hope
but
if
he
did
not
she
would
lie
close
even
if
she
must
wait
until
morning
when
some
labourer
cart
would
surely
pass
and
she
would
hear
it
jolting
and
drag
herself
out
and
call
aloud
in
such
a
way
that
no
man
could
be
deaf
there
was
more
room
under
her
hedge
than
she
had
thought
and
she
found
that
she
could
sit
up
by
clasping
her
knees
and
bending
her
head
while
she
listened
to
every
sound
even
to
the
rustle
of
the
grass
in
the
wind
sweeping
across
the
marsh
she
moved
very
gradually
and
slowly
and
had
just
settled
into
utter
motionlessness
when
she
realised
that
he
was
coming
back
through
the
garden
the
straggling
currant
and
gooseberry
bushes
were
being
trampled
through
betty
go
home
rosalie
had
pleaded
go
home
go
and
she
had
refused
because
she
could
not
desert
her
she
held
her
breath
and
pressed
her
hand
against
her
side
because
her
heart
beat
as
it
seemed
to
her
with
an
actual
sound
he
moved
with
unsteady
steps
from
one
point
to
another
more
than
once
he
stumbled
and
his
angry
oath
reached
her
at
last
he
was
so
near
her
hiding
place
that
his
short
hard
breathing
was
a
distinct
sound
a
moment
later
he
spoke
raising
his
voice
which
fact
brought
to
her
a
rush
of
relief
through
its
signifying
that
he
had
not
even
guessed
her
nearness
my
dear
betty
he
said
you
have
the
pluck
of
the
devil
but
circumstances
are
too
much
for
you
you
are
not
on
the
road
and
i
have
been
through
the
spinney
mere
logic
convinces
me
that
you
can
not
be
far
away
you
may
as
well
give
the
thing
up
it
will
be
better
for
you
who
died
do
not
leave
me
was
betty
inward
cry
and
she
dropped
her
face
on
her
knees
i
am
not
a
fellow
as
you
know
and
i
am
losing
my
hold
on
myself
the
wind
is
blowing
the
mist
away
and
there
will
be
a
moon
i
shall
find
you
my
good
girl
in
half
an
hour
time
and
then
we
shall
be
jolly
well
she
had
not
dropped
her
whip
and
she
held
it
tight
if
when
the
moonlight
revealed
the
pile
of
hop
poles
to
him
he
suspected
and
sprang
at
them
to
tear
them
away
she
would
be
given
strength
to
make
one
spring
even
in
her
agony
and
she
would
strike
at
his
eyes
awfully
without
one
touch
of
compunction
she
would
strike
strike
there
was
a
brief
silence
and
then
a
match
was
struck
again
and
almost
immediately
she
inhaled
the
fragrance
of
an
excellent
cigar
i
am
going
to
have
a
comfortable
smoke
and
stroll
about
always
within
sight
and
hearing
i
daresay
you
are
watching
me
and
wondering
what
will
happen
when
i
discover
you
i
can
tell
you
what
will
happen
you
are
not
a
hysterical
girl
but
you
will
go
into
hysterics
and
no
one
will
hear
all
the
power
of
her
body
and
soul
in
one
leap
on
him
and
then
a
lash
that
would
cut
to
the
bone
and
it
was
not
a
nightmare
and
rosy
was
at
stornham
and
her
father
looking
over
steamer
lists
and
choosing
his
staterooms
he
walked
about
slowly
the
scent
of
his
cigar
floating
behind
him
she
noticed
as
she
had
done
more
than
once
before
that
he
seemed
to
slightly
drag
one
foot
and
she
wondered
why
the
wind
was
blowing
the
mist
away
and
there
was
a
faint
growing
of
light
the
moon
was
not
full
but
young
and
yet
it
would
make
a
difference
but
the
upper
part
of
the
hedge
grew
thick
and
close
to
the
heap
of
wood
and
but
for
her
fall
she
would
never
have
dreamed
of
the
refuge
she
could
only
guess
at
his
movements
but
his
footsteps
gave
some
clue
he
was
examining
the
ground
in
as
far
as
the
darkness
would
allow
he
went
into
the
shed
and
round
about
it
he
opened
the
door
of
the
tiny
coal
lodge
and
looked
again
into
the
small
back
kitchen
he
came
near
nearer
so
near
once
that
bending
sidewise
she
could
have
put
out
a
hand
and
touched
him
he
stood
quite
still
then
made
a
step
or
so
away
stood
still
again
and
burst
into
a
laugh
once
more
oh
you
are
here
are
you
he
said
you
are
a
fine
big
girl
to
be
able
to
crowd
yourself
into
a
place
like
that
hot
and
cold
dew
stood
out
on
her
forehead
and
made
her
hair
damp
as
she
held
her
whip
hard
come
out
my
dear
alluringly
it
is
not
too
soon
or
do
you
prefer
that
i
should
assist
you
her
heart
stood
quite
still
quite
he
was
standing
by
the
wigwam
of
hop
poles
and
thought
she
had
hidden
herself
inside
it
her
place
under
the
hedge
he
had
not
even
glanced
at
she
knew
he
bent
down
and
thrust
his
arm
into
the
wigwam
for
his
fury
at
the
result
expressed
itself
plainly
enough
that
he
had
made
a
fool
of
himself
was
worse
to
him
than
all
else
he
actually
wheeled
about
and
strode
away
to
the
house
because
minutes
seemed
hours
she
thought
he
was
gone
long
but
he
was
not
away
for
twenty
minutes
he
had
in
fact
gone
into
the
bare
front
room
again
and
sitting
upon
the
box
near
the
hearth
let
his
head
drop
in
his
hands
and
remained
in
this
position
thinking
in
the
end
he
got
up
and
went
out
to
the
shed
where
he
had
left
the
horses
betty
was
feeling
that
before
long
she
might
find
herself
making
that
strange
swoop
into
the
darkness
of
space
again
and
that
it
did
not
matter
much
as
one
apparently
lay
quite
still
when
one
was
unconscious
when
she
heard
that
one
horse
was
being
led
out
into
the
lane
what
did
that
mean
had
he
got
tired
of
the
chase
as
the
other
man
did
and
was
he
going
away
because
discomfort
and
fatigue
had
cooled
and
disgusted
him
perhaps
even
made
him
feel
that
he
was
playing
the
part
of
a
sensational
idiot
who
was
laying
himself
open
to
derision
that
would
be
like
him
too
presently
she
heard
his
footsteps
once
more
but
he
did
not
come
as
near
her
as
before
in
fact
he
stood
at
some
yards
distance
when
he
stopped
and
spoke
in
quite
a
new
manner
betty
his
tone
was
even
cynically
cool
i
shall
stalk
you
no
more
the
chase
is
at
an
end
i
think
i
have
taken
all
out
of
you
i
intended
to
perhaps
it
was
a
bad
joke
and
was
carried
too
far
i
wanted
to
prove
to
you
that
there
were
circumstances
which
might
be
too
much
even
for
a
young
woman
from
new
york
i
have
done
it
do
you
suppose
i
am
such
a
fool
as
to
bring
myself
within
reach
of
the
law
i
am
going
away
and
will
send
assistance
to
you
from
the
next
house
i
pass
i
have
left
some
matches
and
a
few
broken
sticks
on
the
hearth
in
the
cottage
be
a
sensible
girl
limp
in
there
and
build
yourself
a
fire
as
soon
as
you
hear
me
gallop
away
you
must
be
chilled
through
now
i
am
he
tramped
across
the
bit
of
garden
down
the
brick
path
mounted
his
horse
and
put
it
to
a
gallop
at
once
clack
clack
clack
clacking
fainter
and
fainter
into
the
distance
and
he
was
gone
when
she
realised
that
the
thing
was
true
the
effect
upon
her
of
her
sense
of
relief
was
that
the
growing
likelihood
of
a
second
swoop
into
darkness
died
away
but
one
curious
sob
lifted
her
chest
as
she
leaned
back
against
the
rough
growth
behind
her
as
she
changed
her
position
for
a
better
one
she
felt
the
jagged
pain
again
and
knew
that
in
the
tenseness
of
her
terror
she
had
actually
for
some
time
felt
next
to
nothing
of
her
hurt
she
had
not
even
been
cold
for
the
hedge
behind
and
over
her
and
the
barricade
before
had
protected
her
from
both
wind
and
rain
the
grass
beneath
her
was
not
damp
for
the
same
reason
the
weary
thought
rose
in
her
mind
that
she
might
even
lie
down
and
sleep
but
she
pulled
herself
together
and
told
herself
that
this
was
like
the
temptation
of
believing
in
the
nightmare
he
was
gone
and
she
had
a
respite
but
was
it
to
be
anything
more
she
did
not
make
any
attempt
to
leave
her
place
of
concealment
remembering
the
strange
things
she
had
learned
in
watching
him
and
the
strange
terror
in
which
rosalie
lived
one
never
knows
what
he
will
do
next
i
will
not
stir
she
said
through
her
teeth
no
i
will
not
stir
from
and
she
did
not
but
sat
still
while
the
pain
came
back
to
her
body
and
the
anguish
to
her
heart
and
sometimes
such
heaviness
that
her
head
dropped
forward
upon
her
knees
again
and
she
fell
into
a
stupefied
from
one
such
doze
she
awakened
with
a
start
hearing
a
slight
click
of
the
gate
after
it
there
were
several
seconds
of
dead
silence
it
was
the
slightness
of
the
click
which
was
startling
if
it
had
not
been
caused
by
the
wind
it
had
been
caused
by
someone
having
cautiously
moved
it
and
this
someone
wishing
to
make
a
soundless
approach
had
immediately
stood
still
and
was
waiting
there
was
only
one
person
who
would
do
that
by
this
time
the
mist
being
blown
away
the
light
of
the
moon
began
to
make
a
growing
clearness
she
lifted
her
hand
and
delicately
held
aside
a
few
twigs
that
she
might
look
out
she
had
been
quite
right
in
deciding
not
to
move
nigel
anstruthers
had
come
back
and
after
his
pause
turned
and
avoiding
the
brick
path
stole
over
the
grass
to
the
cottage
door
his
going
had
merely
been
an
inspiration
to
trap
her
and
the
wood
and
matches
had
been
intended
to
make
a
beacon
light
for
him
that
was
like
him
as
well
his
horse
he
had
left
down
the
road
but
the
relief
of
his
absence
had
been
good
for
her
and
she
was
able
to
check
the
shuddering
fit
which
threatened
her
for
a
moment
the
next
her
ears
awoke
to
a
new
sound
something
was
stumbling
heavily
about
the
patch
of
garden
some
animal
a
cropping
of
grass
a
snorting
breath
and
more
stumbling
hoofs
and
she
knew
that
childe
harold
had
managed
to
loosen
his
bridle
and
limp
out
of
the
shed
the
mere
sense
of
his
nearness
seemed
a
sort
of
protection
he
had
limped
and
stumbled
to
the
front
part
of
the
garden
before
nigel
heard
him
when
he
did
hear
he
came
out
of
the
house
in
the
humour
of
a
man
the
inflaming
of
whose
mood
has
been
cumulative
childe
temper
also
was
not
to
be
trifled
with
he
threw
up
his
head
swinging
the
bridle
out
of
reach
he
snorted
and
even
reared
with
an
ugly
lashing
of
his
forefeet
good
boy
whispered
betty
do
not
let
him
take
you
do
not
if
he
remained
where
he
was
he
would
attract
attention
if
anyone
passed
by
fight
childe
harold
be
as
vicious
as
you
choose
do
not
allow
yourself
to
be
dragged
and
fight
he
did
with
an
ugliness
of
temper
he
had
never
shown
before
with
snortings
and
tossed
head
and
heels
as
if
he
knew
he
was
fighting
to
gain
time
and
with
a
purpose
but
in
the
midst
of
the
struggle
nigel
anstruthers
stopped
suddenly
he
had
stumbled
again
and
risen
raging
and
stained
with
damp
earth
now
he
stood
still
panting
for
breath
as
still
as
he
had
stood
after
the
click
of
the
gate
was
he
listening
what
was
he
listening
to
had
she
moved
in
her
excitement
and
was
it
possible
he
had
caught
the
sound
no
he
was
listening
to
something
else
far
up
the
road
it
echoed
but
coming
nearer
every
moment
and
very
fast
another
horse
a
big
one
galloping
hard
whosoever
it
was
would
pass
this
place
it
could
only
be
a
man
god
grant
that
he
would
not
go
by
so
quickly
that
his
attention
would
not
be
arrested
by
a
shriek
cry
out
she
must
and
if
he
did
not
hear
and
went
galloping
on
his
way
she
would
have
betrayed
herself
and
be
lost
she
bit
off
a
groan
by
biting
her
lip
you
who
died
now
now
nearer
and
nearer
no
human
creature
could
pass
by
a
thing
like
this
it
would
not
be
possible
and
childe
harold
backing
and
fighting
scented
the
other
horse
and
neighed
fiercely
and
high
the
rider
was
slackening
his
pace
he
was
near
the
lane
he
had
turned
into
it
and
stopped
now
for
her
one
frantic
cry
but
before
she
could
gather
power
to
give
it
forth
the
man
who
had
stopped
had
flung
himself
from
his
saddle
and
was
inside
the
garden
speaking
a
big
voice
and
a
clear
one
with
a
ringing
tone
of
authority
what
are
you
doing
here
and
what
is
the
matter
with
miss
horse
it
called
out
now
there
was
danger
of
the
swoop
into
the
darkness
great
danger
though
she
clutched
at
the
hedge
that
she
might
feel
its
thorns
and
hold
herself
to
the
earth
you
nigel
anstruthers
cried
out
you
and
flung
forth
a
shout
of
laughter
where
is
she
fiercely
lady
anstruthers
is
terrified
we
have
been
searching
for
hours
only
just
now
i
heard
on
the
marsh
that
she
had
been
seen
to
ride
this
way
where
is
she
i
say
a
strong
angry
earthly
voice
not
part
of
the
melodrama
not
part
of
a
dream
but
a
voice
she
knew
and
whose
sound
caused
her
heart
to
leap
to
her
throat
while
she
trembled
from
head
to
foot
and
a
light
cold
dampness
broke
forth
on
her
skin
something
had
been
a
dream
her
wild
desolate
ride
the
slow
tolling
for
the
voice
which
commanded
with
such
human
fierceness
was
that
of
the
man
for
whom
the
heavy
bell
had
struck
forth
from
the
church
tower
sir
nigel
recovered
himself
brilliantly
not
that
he
did
not
recognise
that
he
had
been
a
fool
again
and
was
in
a
nasty
place
but
it
was
not
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
and
he
had
learned
how
to
brazen
himself
out
of
nasty
places
my
dear
mount
dunstan
he
answered
with
tolerant
irritation
i
have
been
having
a
devil
of
a
time
with
female
hysterics
she
heard
the
bell
toll
and
ran
away
with
the
idea
that
it
was
for
you
and
paid
you
the
compliment
of
losing
her
head
i
came
on
her
here
when
she
had
ridden
her
horse
half
to
death
and
they
had
both
come
a
cropper
confound
women
hysterics
i
could
do
nothing
with
her
when
i
left
her
for
a
moment
she
ran
away
and
hid
herself
she
is
concealed
somewhere
on
the
place
or
has
limped
off
on
to
the
marsh
i
wish
some
new
york
millionairess
would
work
herself
into
hysteria
on
my
humble
those
are
lies
mount
dunstan
answered
every
damned
one
of
them
he
wheeled
around
to
look
about
him
attracted
by
a
sound
and
in
the
clearing
moonlight
saw
a
figure
approaching
which
might
have
risen
from
the
earth
so
far
as
he
could
guess
where
it
had
come
from
he
strode
over
to
it
and
it
was
betty
vanderpoel
holding
her
whip
in
a
clenched
hand
and
showing
to
his
eagerness
such
hunted
face
and
eyes
as
were
barely
human
he
caught
her
unsteadiness
to
support
it
and
felt
her
fingers
clutch
at
the
tweed
of
his
coatsleeve
and
move
there
as
if
the
mere
feeling
of
its
rough
texture
brought
heavenly
comfort
to
her
and
gave
her
strength
yes
they
are
lies
lord
mount
dunstan
she
panted
he
said
that
he
meant
to
get
what
he
called
with
me
he
told
me
i
could
not
get
away
from
him
and
that
no
one
would
hear
me
if
i
cried
out
for
help
i
have
hidden
like
some
hunted
her
shaking
voice
broke
and
she
held
the
cloth
of
his
sleeve
tightly
you
are
alive
alive
with
a
sudden
sweet
wildness
but
it
is
true
the
bell
tolled
while
i
was
crouching
in
the
dark
i
called
to
you
who
died
to
stand
between
us
the
man
absolutely
shuddered
from
head
to
foot
i
was
alive
and
you
see
i
heard
you
and
came
he
answered
hoarsely
he
lifted
her
in
his
arms
and
carried
her
into
the
cottage
her
cheek
felt
the
enrapturing
roughness
of
his
tweed
shoulder
as
he
did
it
he
laid
her
down
on
the
couch
of
hay
and
turned
away
do
move
he
said
i
will
come
back
you
are
if
there
had
been
more
light
she
would
have
seen
that
his
jaw
was
set
like
a
bulldog
and
there
was
a
red
spark
in
his
eyes
a
fearsome
one
but
though
she
did
not
clearly
see
she
knew
and
the
nearness
of
the
last
hours
swept
away
all
relenting
nigel
anstruthers
having
discreetly
waited
until
the
two
had
passed
into
the
house
and
feeling
that

from

atmosphere

highly
charged
was
making
his
way
toward
the
lane
and
was
indeed
halfway
through
the
gate
when
heavy
feet
were
behind
him
and
a
grip
of
ugly
strength
wrenched
him
backward
your
horse
is
cropping
the
grass
where
you
left
him
but
you
are
not
going
to
him
said
a
singularly
meaning
voice
you
are
coming
with
anstruthers
endeavoured
to
convince
himself
that
he
did
not
at
that
moment
turn
deadly
sick
and
that
the
brute
would
not
make
an
ass
of
himself
do
be
a
bally
fool
he
cried
out
trying
to
tear
himself
free
the
muscular
hand
on
his
shoulder
being
reinforced
by
another
which
clutched
his
collar
dragged
him
back
stumbling
ignominiously
through
the
gooseberry
bushes
towards
the
betty
lying
upon
her
bed
of
hay
heard
the
scuffling
mingled
with
raging
and
gasping
curses
childe
harold
lifting
his
head
from
his
cropping
of
the
grass
looked
after
the
violently
jerking
figures
and
snorted
slightly
snuffing
with
dilated
red
nostrils
as
a
war
horse
scenting
blood
and
battle
he
was
excited
when
mount
dunstan
got
his
captive
into
the
shed
the
blood
which
had
surged
in
red
godwyn
veins
was
up
and
leaping
anstruthers
his
collar
held
by
a
hand
with
fingers
of
iron
writhed
about
and
turned
a
livid
ghastly
face
upon
his
captor
you
have
twice
my
strength
and
half
my
age
you
beast
and
devil
he
foamed
in
a
half
shriek
and
poured
forth
frightful
blasphemies
that
counts
between
man
and
man
but
not
between
vermin
and
executioner
gave
back
mount
dunstan
the
heavy
whip
flung
upward
whistled
down
through
the
air
cutting
through
cloth
and
linen
as
though
it
would
cut
through
flesh
to
bone
by
god
shrieked
the
writhing
thing
he
held
leaping
like
a
man
who
has
been
shot
do
do
that
again
damn
you
as
the
unswerving
lash
cut
down
again
again
what
followed
would
not
be
good
to
describe
betty
through
the
open
door
heard
wild
and
awful
things
and
more
than
once
a
sound
as
if
a
dog
were
howling
when
the
thing
was
over
one
of
the
two
his
clothes
cut
to
ribbons
his
torn
white
linen
exposed
lay
a
writhing
huddled
worm
hiccoughing
frenzied
sobs
upon
the
earth
in
a
corner
of
the
the
other
man
stood
over
him
breathless
and
white
but
singularly
exalted
you
wo
want
your
horse
because
you
ca
use
him
he
said
i
shall
put
miss
vanderpoel
saddle
upon
him
and
ride
with
her
back
to
stornham
you
think
you
are
cut
to
pieces
but
you
are
not
and
you
get
over
it
i
ask
you
to
mark
however
that
if
you
open
your
foul
mouth
to
insinuate
lies
concerning
either
lady
anstruthers
or
her
sister
i
will
do
this
thing
again
in
public
some
day
on
the
steps
of
your
club
and
do
it
more
he
walked
into
the
cottage
soon
afterwards
looking
to
betty
vanderpoel
eyes
pale
and
exceptionally
big
and
also
more
a
man
than
it
is
often
given
even
to
the
most
virile
male
creature
to
look
and
he
walked
to
the
side
of
her
resting
place
and
stood
there
looking
down
i
thought
i
heard
a
dog
howl
she
said
you
did
hear
a
dog
howl
he
answered
he
said
no
other
word
and
she
asked
no
further
question
she
knew
what
he
had
done
and
he
was
well
aware
that
she
knew
it
there
was
a
long
strangely
tense
silence
the
light
of
the
moon
was
growing
she
made
at
first
no
effort
to
rise
but
lay
still
and
looked
up
at
him
from
under
splendid
lifted
lashes
while
his
own
gaze
fell
into
the
depth
of
hers
like
a
plummet
into
a
deep
pool
this
continued
for
almost
a
full
minute
when
he
turned
quickly
away
and
walked
to
the
hearth
indrawing
a
heavy
breath
he
could
not
endure
that
which
beset
him
it
was
unbearable
because
her
eyes
had
maddeningly
seemed
to
ask
him
some
wistful
question
why
did
she
let
her
loveliness
so
call
to
him
she
was
not
a
trifler
who
could
play
with
meanings
perhaps
she
did
not
know
what
her
power
was
sometimes
he
could
believe
that
beautiful
women
did
not
in
a
few
moments
almost
before
he
could
reach
her
she
was
rising
and
when
she
got
up
she
supported
herself
against
the
open
door
standing
in
the
moonlight
if
he
was
pale
she
was
pale
also
and
her
large
eyes
would
not
move
from
his
face
so
drawing
him
that
he
could
not
keep
away
from
her
listen
he
broke
out
suddenly
penzance
told
me
warned
me
that
some
time
a
moment
would
come
which
would
be
stronger
than
all
else
in
a
man
than
all
else
in
the
world
it
has
come
now
let
me
take
you
than
what
else
she
said
slowly
and
became
even
paler
than
before
he
strove
to
release
himself
from
the
possession
of
the
moment
and
in
his
struggle
answered
with
a
sort
of
savagery
than
scruple
than
power
even
than
a
man
determination
and
decent
are
you
proud
she
half
whispered
quite
brokenly
i
am
not
since
i
waited
for
the
ringing
of
the
church
bell
since
i
heard
it
toll
after
that
the
world
was
empty
and
it
was
as
empty
of
decent
pride
as
of
everything
else
there
was
nothing
left
i
was
the
humblest
broken
thing
on
you
he
gasped
do
you
know
i
think
i
shall
go
mad
directly
perhaps
it
is
happening
now
you
were
humble
and
broken
your
world
was
empty
because
look
at
me
lord
mount
dunstan
and
the
sweetest
voice
in
the
world
was
a
tender
wild
little
cry
to
him
oh
look
at
me
he
caught
her
hands
and
looked
down
into
the
beautiful
passionate
soul
of
her
the
moment
had
come
and
the
tidal
wave
rising
to
its
height
swept
all
the
common
earth
away
when
with
a
savage
sob
he
caught
and
held
her
close
and
hard
against
that
which
thudded
racing
in
his
breast
and
they
stood
and
swayed
together
folded
in
each
other
arms
while
the
wind
from
the
marshes
lifted
its
voice
like
an
exulting
human
thing
as
it
swept
about
them
chapter
xlix
at
stornham
and
at
broadmorlands
the
exulting
wind
had
swept
the
clouds
away
and
the
moon
rode
in
a
dark
blue
sea
of
sky
making
the
night
light
purely
clear
when
they
drew
a
little
apart
that
they
might
better
see
the
wonderfulness
in
each
other
faces
it
was
so
mysteriously
great
a
thing
that
they
felt
near
to
awe
i
fought
too
long
i
wore
out
my
body
endurance
and
now
i
am
quaking
like
a
boy
red
godwyn
did
not
begin
his
wooing
like
this
forgive
me
mount
dunstan
said
at
last
do
you
know
with
lovely
trembling
lips
and
voice
that
for
long
long
you
have
been
unkind
to
me
it
was
merely
human
that
he
should
swiftly
enfold
her
again
and
answer
with
his
lips
against
her
cheek
unkind
unkind
oh
the
heavenly
woman
sweetness
of
your
telling
me
so
the
heavenly
sweetness
of
it
he
exclaimed
passionately
and
low
and
i
was
one
of
those
who
are
the
roadside
everywhere
an
unkempt
raging
beggar
who
might
not
decently
ask
you
for
a
it
was
all
wrong
wrong
she
whispered
back
to
him
and
he
poured
forth
the
tenderest
fierce
words
of
confession
and
prayer
and
she
listened
drinking
them
in
with
now
and
then
a
soft
sob
pressed
against
the
roughness
of
the
enrapturing
tweed
for
a
space
they
had
both
forgotten
her
hurt
because
there
are
other
things
than
terror
which
hypnotise
pain
mount
dunstan
was
to
be
praised
for
remembering
it
first
he
must
take
her
back
to
stornham
and
her
sister
without
further
delay
i
will
put
your
saddle
on
anstruthers
horse
or
mine
and
lift
you
to
your
seat
there
is
a
farmhouse
about
two
miles
away
where
i
will
take
you
first
for
food
and
warmth
perhaps
it
would
be
well
for
you
to
stay
there
to
rest
for
an
hour
or
so
and
i
will
send
a
message
to
lady
i
will
go
to
the
place
and
eat
and
drink
what
you
advise
she
answered
but
i
beg
you
to
take
me
back
to
rosalie
without
delay
i
feel
that
i
must
see
i
feel
that
i
must
see
her
too
he
said
but
for
her
god
bless
her
he
added
after
his
sudden
pause
betty
knew
that
the
exclamation
meant
strong
feeling
and
that
somehow
in
the
past
hours
rosalie
had
awakened
it
but
it
was
only
when
after
their
refreshment
at
the
farm
they
had
taken
horse
again
and
were
riding
homeward
together
that
she
heard
from
him
what
had
passed
between
them
all
that
has
led
to
this
may
seem
the
merest
chance
he
said
but
surely
a
strange
thing
has
come
about
i
know
that
without
understanding
he
leaned
over
and
touched
her
hand
you
who
are
life
without
understanding
i
ride
here
beside
you
believing
that
you
brought
me
i
tried
i
tried
with
all
my
strength
i
after
i
had
seen
your
sister
i
guessed
i
knew
but
not
at
first
i
was
not
ill
of
the
fever
as
excited
rumour
had
it
but
i
was
ill
and
the
doctors
and
the
vicar
were
alarmed
i
had
fought
too
long
and
i
was
giving
up
as
i
have
seen
the
poor
fellows
in
the
ballroom
give
up
if
they
were
not
dragged
back
they
slipped
out
of
one
hands
if
the
fever
had
developed
all
would
have
been
over
quickly
i
knew
the
doctors
feared
that
and
i
am
ashamed
to
say
i
was
glad
of
it
but
yesterday
in
the
morning
when
i
was
letting
myself
go
with
a
morbid
pleasure
in
the
luxurious
relief
of
it
something
reached
me
some
slow
rising
call
to
effort
and
she
turned
towards
him
in
her
saddle
listening
her
lips
parted
i
did
not
even
ask
myself
what
was
happening
but
i
began
to
be
conscious
of
being
drawn
back
and
to
long
intensely
to
see
you
again
i
was
gradually
filled
with
a
restless
feeling
that
you
were
near
me
and
that
though
i
could
not
physically
hear
your
voice
you
were
surely
calling
to
me
it
was
the
thing
which
could
not
be
but
it
was
and
because
of
it
i
could
not
let
myself
i
did
call
you
i
was
on
my
knees
in
the
church
asking
to
be
forgiven
if
i
prayed
mad
prayers
but
praying
the
same
thing
over
and
over
the
villagers
were
kneeling
there
too
they
crowded
in
leaving
everything
else
you
are
their
hero
and
they
were
in
deep
his
look
was
gravely
pondering
his
life
had
not
made
a
mystic
of
him
it
was
penzance
who
was
the
mystic
but
he
felt
himself
perplexed
by
mysteriously
suggestive
thought
i
was
brought
back
i
was
brought
back
he
said
in
the
afternoon
i
fell
asleep
and
slept
profoundly
until
the
morning
when
i
awoke
i
realised
that
i
was
a
remade
man
the
doctors
were
almost
awed
when
i
first
spoke
to
them
old
fenwick
died
later
and
after
i
had
heard
about
it
the
church
bell
was
tolled
it
was
heard
at
farmhouse
and
as
everybody
had
been
excitedly
waiting
for
the
sound
it
conveyed
but
one
idea
to
them
and
the
boy
was
sent
racing
across
the
fields
to
stornham
village
dearest
dearest
he
exclaimed
she
had
bowed
her
head
and
burst
into
passionate
sobbing
because
she
was
not
of
the
women
who
wept
her
moment
passion
was
strong
and
bitter
it
need
not
have
been
she
shuddered
one
can
not
bear
it
because
it
need
not
have
been
stop
your
horse
a
moment
he
said
reining
in
his
own
while
with
burning
eyes
and
swelling
throat
he
held
and
steadied
her
but
he
did
not
know
that
neither
her
sister
nor
her
father
had
ever
seen
her
in
such
mood
and
that
she
had
never
so
seen
herself
you
shall
not
remember
it
he
said
to
her
i
will
not
she
answered
recovering
herself
but
for
one
moment
all
the
awful
hours
rushed
back
tell
me
the
we
did
not
know
that
the
blunder
had
been
made
until
a
messenger
from
dole
rode
over
to
inquire
and
bring
messages
of
condolence
then
we
understood
what
had
occurred
and
i
own
a
sort
of
frenzy
seized
me
i
knew
i
must
see
you
and
though
the
doctors
were
horribly
nervous
they
dare
not
hold
me
back
the
day
before
it
would
not
have
been
believed
that
i
could
leave
my
room
you
were
crying
out
to
me
and
though
i
did
not
know
i
was
answering
body
and
soul
penzance
knew
i
must
have
my
way
when
i
spoke
to
him
mad
as
it
seemed
when
i
rode
through
stornham
village
more
than
one
woman
screamed
at
sight
of
me
i
shall
not
be
able
to
blot
out
of
my
mind
your
sister
face
she
will
tell
you
what
we
said
to
each
other
i
rode
away
from
the
court
quite
half
mad
his
voice
became
very
gentle
because
of
something
she
had
told
me
in
the
first
wild
lady
anstruthers
had
spent
the
night
moving
restlessly
from
one
room
to
another
and
had
not
been
to
bed
when
they
rode
side
by
side
up
the
avenue
in
the
early
morning
sunlight
an
under
keeper
crossing
the
park
a
few
hundred
yards
above
them
after
one
glance
dashed
across
the
sward
to
the
courtyard
and
the
servants
hall
the
news
flashed
electrically
through
the
house
and
rosalie
like
a
small
ghost
came
out
upon
the
steps
as
they
reined
in
though
her
lips
moved
she
could
not
speak
aloud
as
she
watched
mount
dunstan
lift
her
sister
from
her
horse
childe
harold
stumbled
and
i
hurt
my
foot
said
betty
trying
to
be
calm
i
knew
he
would
find
you
rosalie
answered
quite
faintly
i
knew
you
would
turning
to
mount
dunstan
adoring
him
with
all
the
meaning
of
her
small
paled
face
she
would
have
been
afraid
of
her
memory
of
what
she
had
said
in
the
strange
scene
which
had
taken
place
before
them
a
few
hours
ago
but
almost
before
either
of
the
two
spoke
she
knew
that
a
great
gulf
had
been
crossed
in
some
one
inevitable
though
unforeseen
leap
how
it
had
been
taken
when
or
where
did
not
in
the
least
matter
when
she
clung
to
betty
and
betty
clung
to
her
after
a
few
moments
of
moved
and
reverent
waiting
the
admirable
jennings
stepped
forward
and
addressed
her
in
lowered
voice
there
been
little
sleep
in
the
village
this
night
my
lady
he
murmured
earnestly
i
promised
they
should
have
a
sign
with
your
permission
if
the
flag
was
run
up
they
all
looking
out
and
run
it
up
jennings
lady
anstruthers
answered
at
when
it
ran
up
the
staff
on
the
tower
and
fluttered
out
in
gay
answering
to
the
morning
breeze
children
in
the
village
began
to
run
about
shouting
men
and
women
appeared
at
cottage
doors
and
more
than
one
cap
was
thrown
up
in
the
air
but
old
doby
and
welden
who
had
been
waiting
for
hours
standing
by
welden
gate
caught
each
dry
trembling
old
hands
and
began
to
cry
the
broadmorlands
divorce
scandal
having
made
conversation
during
a
season
quite
forty
years
before
miss
vanderpoel
appeared
at
stornham
court
had
been
laid
upon
a
lower
shelf
and
buried
beneath
other
stories
long
enough
to
be
forgotten
only
one
individual
had
not
forgotten
it
and
he
was
the
duke
of
broadmorlands
himself
in
whose
mind
it
remained
hideously
clear
he
had
been
a
young
man
honestly
and
much
in
love
when
it
first
revealed
itself
to
him
and
for
a
few
months
he
had
even
thought
it
might
end
by
being
his
death
notwithstanding
that
he
was
strong
and
in
physical
condition
he
had
been
a
fine
hearty
young
man
of
clean
and
rather
dignified
life
though
he
was
not
understood
to
be
brilliant
of
mind
privately
he
had
ideals
connected
with
his
rank
and
name
which
he
was
not
fluent
enough
clearly
to
express
after
he
had
realised
that
he
should
not
die
of
the
public
humiliation
and
disgrace
which
seemed
to
point
him
out
as
having
been
the
kind
of
gullible
fool
it
is
scarcely
possible
to
avoid
laughing
at
or
so
it
seemed
to
him
in
his
frenzy
he
thought
it
not
improbable
that
he
should
go
mad
he
was
harried
so
by
memories
of
lovely
little
soft
ways
of
edith
his
wife
name
was
edith
of
the
pretty
sound
of
her
laugh
and
of
her
innocent
girlish
habit
of
kneeling
down
by
her
bedside
every
night
and
morning
to
say
her
prayers
this
had
so
touched
him
that
he
had
sometimes
knelt
down
to
say
his
too
saying
to
her
with
slight
awkward
boyishness
that
a
fellow
who
had
a
sort
of
angel
for
his
wife
ought
to
do
his
best
to
believe
in
the
things
she
believed
in
and
all
the
time
a
devil
who
laughed
used
to
snigger
in
his
ear
over
and
over
again
until
it
was
almost
like
the
ticking
of
a
clock
during
the
worst
months
when
it
did
not
seem
probable
that
a
man
could
feel
his
brain
whirling
like
a
catherine
wheel
night
and
day
and
still
manage
to
hold
on
and
not
reach
the
point
of
howling
and
shrieking
and
dashing
his
skull
against
wails
and
furniture
but
that
passed
in
time
and
he
told
himself
that
he
passed
with
it
since
then
he
had
lived
chiefly
at
broadmorlands
castle
and
was
spoken
of
as
a
man
who
had
become
religious
which
was
not
true
but
having
reached
the
decision
that
religion
was
good
for
most
people
he
paid
a
good
deal
of
attention
to
his
church
and
schools
and
was
rigorous
in
the
matter
of
curates
he
had
passed
seventy
now
and
was
somewhat
despotic
and
haughty
because
a
man
who
is
a
duke
and
does
not
go
out
into
the
world
to
rub
against
men
of
his
own
class
and
others
but
lives
altogether
on
a
great
and
splendid
estate
saluted
by
every
creature
he
meets
and
universally
obeyed
and
counted
before
all
else
is
not
unlikely
to
forget
that
he
is
a
quite
ordinary
human
being
and
not
a
sort
of
monarch
he
had
done
his
best
to
forget
edith
who
had
soon
died
of
being
a
shady
curate
wife
in
australia
but
he
had
not
been
able
to
encompass
it
he
used
occasionally
to
dream
she
was
kneeling
by
the
bed
in
her
childish
nightgown
saying
her
prayers
aloud
and
would
waken
crying
as
he
had
cried
in
those
awful
young
days
against
social
immorality
or
village
he
was
relentlessly
savage
he
allowed
for
no
palliating
or
exonerating
facts
he
began
to
see
red
when
he
heard
of
or
saw
lightness
in
a
married
woman
and
the
outside
world
frequently
said
that
this
characteristic
bordered
on
monomania
nigel
anstruthers
having
met
him
once
or
twice
had
at
first
been
much
amused
by
him
and
had
even
by
giving
him
an
adroitly
careful
lead
managed
to
guide
him
into
an
expression
of
opinion
the
duke
who
had
heard
men
of
his
class
discussed
did
not
in
the
least
like
him
notwithstanding
his
sympathetic
suavity
of
manner
and
his
air
of
being
intelligently
impressed
by
what
he
heard
not
long
afterwards
however
it
transpired
that
the
aged
rector
of
broadmorlands
having
died
the
living
had
been
given
to
ffolliott
and
hearing
it
sir
nigel
was
not
slow
to
conjecture
that
quite
decently
utilisable
tools
would
lie
ready
to
his
hand
if
circumstances
pressed
this
point
of
view
it
will
be
seen
being
not
illogical
a
man
who
had
not
been
a
sort
of
hermit
would
have
heard
enough
of
him
to
be
put
on
his
guard
and
one
who
was
a
man
of
the
world
looking
normally
on
existence
would
have
reasoned
coolly
and
declined
to
concern
himself
about
what
was
not
his
affair
but
a
parallel
might
be
drawn
between
broadmorlands
and
some
old
lion
wounded
sorely
in
his
youth
and
left
to
drag
his
unhealed
torment
through
the
years
of
age
on
one
subject
he
had
no
point
of
view
but
his
own
and
could
be
roused
to
fury
almost
senseless
by
wholly
inadequately
supported
facts
he
presented
exactly
the
material
required
and
that
in
mass
about
the
time
the
flag
was
run
up
on
the
tower
at
stornham
court
a
carter
driving
whistling
on
the
road
near
the
deserted
cottage
was
hailed
by
a
man
who
was
walking
slowly
a
few
yards
ahead
of
him
the
carter
thought
that
he
was
a
tramp
as
his
clothes
were
plainly
in
bad
case
which
seeing
his
answer
was
an
unceremonious
grunt
and
it
certainly
did
not
occur
to
him
to
touch
his
forehead
a
minute
later
however
he
got
a
start
as
he
related
afterwards
the
tramp
was
a
gentleman
whose
riding
costume
was
torn
and
muddied
and
who
looked
gashly
though
he
spoke
with
the
manner
and
authority
which
binns
the
carter
recognised
as
that
of
one
of
the
gentry
addressing
a
how
far
is
it
from
here
to
medham
he
inquired
medham
be
about
four
mile
sir
was
the
answer
i
be
carryin
these
there
to
i
want
to
get
there
i
have
met
with
an
accident
my
horse
took
fright
at
a
pheasant
starting
up
rocketting
under
his
nose
he
threw
me
into
a
hedge
and
bolted
i
badly
enough
bruised
to
want
to
reach
a
town
and
see
a
doctor
can
you
give
me
a
lift
that
i
will
sir
ready
enough
making
room
on
the
seat
beside
him
you
be
bruised
bad
sir
he
said
sympathetically
as
his
passenger
climbed
to
his
place
with
a
twisted
face
and
uttering
blasphemies
under
his
breath
damned
badly
he
answered
no
bones
broken
that
cut
on
your
cheek
and
neck
need
plasterin
that
a
scratch
thorn
bush
curtly
sympathy
was
plainly
not
welcome
in
fact
binns
was
soon
of
the
opinion
that
here
was
an
ugly
customer
gentleman
or
no
gentleman
a
jolting
cart
was
however
not
the
best
place
for
a
man
who
seemed
sore
from
head
to
foot
and
done
for
out
and
out
he
sat
and
ground
his
teeth
as
he
clung
to
the
rough
seat
in
the
attempt
to
steady
himself
he
became
more
and
more
gashly
and
a
certain
awful
light
in
his
eyes
alarmed
the
carter
by
leaping
up
at
every
jolt
binns
was
glad
when
he
left
him
at
medham
arms
and
felt
he
had
earned
the
handed
to
him
four
days
anstruthers
lay
in
bed
in
a
room
at
the
inn
no
one
saw
him
but
the
man
who
brought
him
food
he
did
not
send
for
a
doctor
because
he
did
not
wish
to
see
one
he
sent
for
such
remedies
as
were
needed
by
a
man
who
had
been
bruised
by
a
fall
from
his
horse
he
made
no
remark
which
could
be
considered
explanatory
after
he
had
said
irritably
that
a
man
was
a
fool
to
go
loitering
along
on
a
nervous
brute
who
needed
watching
whatsoever
happened
was
his
own
damned
fault
through
hours
of
day
and
night
he
lay
staring
at
the
whitewashed
beams
or
the
blue
roses
on
the
wall
paper
they
were
long
hours
and
filled
with
things
not
pleasant
enough
to
dwell
on
in
detail
physical
misery
which
made
a
man
writhe
at
times
was
not
the
worst
part
of
them
there
were
a
thousand
things
less
endurable
more
than
once
he
foamed
at
the
mouth
and
recognised
that
he
gibbered
like
a
madman
there
was
but
one
memory
which
saved
him
from
feeling
that
this
was
the
very
end
of
things
that
was
the
memory
of
broadmorlands
while
a
man
had
a
weapon
left
even
though
it
could
not
save
him
he
might
pay
up
with
it
get
almost
even
the
whole
vanderpoel
lot
could
be
plunged
neck
deep
in
a
morass
which
would
leave
mud
enough
sticking
to
them
even
if
their
money
helped
them
to
prevent
its
entirely
closing
over
their
heads
he
could
attend
to
that
and
after
he
had
set
it
well
going
he
could
get
out
there
were
india
south
africa
australia
a
dozen
places
that
would
do
and
then
he
would
remember
betty
vanderpoel
and
curse
horribly
under
the
bed
clothes
it
was
the
memory
of
betty
which
outdid
all
others
in
its
power
to
torment
on
the
morning
of
the
fifth
day
the
duke
of
broadmorlands
received
a
note
which
he
read
with
somewhat
annoyed
curiosity
a
certain
sir
nigel
anstruthers
whom
it
appeared
he
ought
to
be
able
to
recall
was
in
the
neighbourhood
and
wished
to
see
him
on
a
parochial
matter
of
interest
parochial
matter
was
vague
and
so
was
the
duke
recollection
of
the
man
who
addressed
him
if
his
memory
served
him
rightly
he
had
met
him
in
a
country
house
in
somersetshire
and
had
heard
that
he
was
the
acquaintance
of
the
disreputable
eldest
son
what
could
a
person
of
that
sort
have
to
say
of
parochial
matters
the
duke
considered
and
then
in
obedience
to
a
rigorous
conscience
decided
that
one
ought
perhaps
to
give
him
half
an
hour
there
was
that
in
the
intruder
aspect
when
he
arrived
in
the
afternoon
which
produced
somewhat
the
effect
of
shock
in
the
first
place
a
man
in
his
unconcealable
physical
condition
had
no
right
to
be
out
of
his
bed
though
he
plainly
refused
to
admit
the
fact
his
manner
of
bearing
himself
erect
and
even
with
a
certain
touch
of
cool
swagger
was
it
was
evident
achieved
only
by
determined
effort
he
looked
like
a
man
who
had
not
yet
recovered
from
some
evil
fever
since
the
meeting
in
somersetshire
he
had
aged
more
than
the
year
warranted
despite
his
obstinate
fight
with
himself
it
was
obvious
that
he
was
horribly
shaky
a
disagreeable
scratch
or
cut
running
from
cheek
to
neck
did
not
improve
his
personal
appearance
he
pleased
his
host
no
more
than
he
had
pleased
him
at
their
first
encounter
he
in
fact
repelled
him
strongly
by
suggesting
a
degree
of
abnormality
of
mood
which
was
smoothed
over
by
an
attempt
at
entire
normality
of
manner
the
duke
did
not
present
an
approachable
front
as
after
anstruthers
had
taken
a
chair
he
sat
and
examined
him
with
bright
blue
old
eyes
set
deep
on
either
side
of
a
dominant
nose
and
framed
over
by
white
eyebrows
no
nigel
anstruthers
summed
him
up
it
would
not
be
easy
to
open
the
matter
with
the
old
fool
he
held
himself
magnificently
aloof
with
that
lack
of
modernity
in
his
sense
of
place
which
even
at
this
late
day
sometimes
expressed
itself
here
and
there
in
the
manner
of
the
feudal
survival
i
am
afraid
you
have
been
ill
with
rigid
civility
a
man
feels
rather
an
outsider
in
confessing
he
has
let
his
horse
throw
him
into
a
hedge
it
was
my
own
fault
entirely
i
allowed
myself
to
forget
that
i
was
riding
a
dangerously
nervous
brute
i
was
thinking
of
a
painful
and
absorbing
subject
i
was
badly
bruised
and
scratched
but
that
was
what
did
your
doctor
say
that
i
was
in
luck
not
to
have
broken
my
you
had
better
have
a
glass
of
wine
touching
a
bell
you
do
not
look
equal
to
any
in
gathering
himself
together
sir
nigel
felt
he
was
forced
to
use
enormous
effort
it
had
cost
him
a
gruesome
physical
struggle
to
endure
the
drive
over
to
broadmorlands
though
it
was
only
a
few
miles
from
medham
there
had
been
something
unnatural
in
the
exertion
necessary
to
sit
upright
and
keep
his
mind
decently
clear
that
was
the
worst
of
it
the
fever
and
raging
hours
of
the
past
days
and
nights
had
so
shaken
him
that
he
had
become
exhausted
and
his
brain
was
not
alert
he
was
not
thinking
rapidly
and
several
times
he
had
lost
sight
of
a
point
it
was
important
to
remember
he
grew
hot
and
cold
and
knew
his
hands
and
voice
shook
as
he
answered
but
perhaps
he
felt
desperately
signs
of
emotion
were
not
bad
i
am
not
quite
equal
to
exertion
he
began
slowly
but
a
man
can
not
lie
on
his
bed
while
some
things
are
undone
a
man
can
not
as
the
old
duke
sat
upright
the
blue
eyes
under
his
bent
brows
were
startled
as
well
as
curious
was
the
man
going
out
of
his
mind
about
something
he
looked
rather
like
it
with
the
dampness
starting
out
on
his
haggard
face
and
the
ugly
look
suddenly
stamped
there
the
fact
was
that
the
insensate
fury
which
had
possessed
and
torn
anstruthers
as
he
had
writhed
in
his
inn
bedroom
had
sprung
upon
him
again
in
full
force
and
his
weakness
could
not
control
it
though
it
would
have
been
wiser
to
hold
it
in
check
he
also
felt
frightfully
ill
which
filled
him
with
despair
and
through
this
fact
he
lost
sight
of
the
effect
he
produced
as
he
stood
up
shaking
all
over
i
come
to
you
because
you
are
the
one
man
who
can
most
easily
understand
the
thing
i
have
been
concealing
for
a
good
many
the
duke
was
irritated
confound
the
objectionable
idiot
what
did
he
mean
by
taking
that
intimate
tone
with
a
man
who
was
not
prepared
to
concern
himself
in
his
affairs
excuse
me
he
said
holding
up
an
authoritative
hand
are
you
going
to
make
a
confession
i
do
like
such
things
i
prefer
to
be
excused
personal
confidences
are
not
parochial
this
one
and
sir
nigel
was
sickeningly
conscious
that
he
was
putting
the
statement
rashly
while
at
the
same
time
all
better
words
escaped
him
it
is
as
much
a
parochial
matter
losing
all
hold
on
his
wits
and
stammering
as
was
as
was
the
affair
of
your
it
was
the
duke
who
stood
up
now
scarlet
with
anger
he
sprang
from
his
chair
as
if
he
had
been
a
young
man
in
whom
some
insult
had
struck
blazing
fire
you
you
dare
he
shouted
you
insolent
blackguard
you
force
your
way
in
here
and
dare
dare
and
he
clenched
his
fist
wildly
shaking
it
nigel
anstruthers
staggering
on
his
uncertain
feet
would
have
shouted
also
but
could
not
though
he
tried
and
he
heard
his
own
voice
come
forth
brokenly
yes
i
dare
i
your
my
own
my
swaying
and
tottering
he
swung
round
to
the
chair
he
had
left
and
fell
into
it
even
while
the
old
duke
who
stood
raging
before
him
started
back
in
outraged
amazement
what
was
the
fellow
doing
was
he
making
faces
at
him
the
drawn
malignant
mouth
and
muscles
suggested
it
was
he
a
lunatic
indeed
but
the
sense
of
disgusted
outrage
changed
all
at
once
to
horror
as
with
a
countenance
still
more
hideously
livid
and
twisted
his
visitor
slid
helplessly
from
his
seat
and
lay
a
huddling
heap
of
clothes
on
the
floor
chapter
l
the
primeval
thing
when
vanderpoel
landed
in
england
his
wife
was
with
him
this
woman
who
was
known
to
be
on
her
way
to
join
her
daughter
in
england
was
much
discussed
envied
and
glanced
at
when
she
promenaded
the
deck
with
her
husband
or
sat
in
her
chair
softly
wrapped
in
wonderful
furs
gradually
during
the
past
months
she
had
been
told
certain
modified
truths
connected
with
her
elder
daughter
marriage
they
had
been
painful
truths
but
had
been
so
softened
and
expurgated
of
their
worst
features
that
it
had
been
possible
to
bear
them
when
one
realised
that
they
did
not
at
least
mean
that
rosy
had
forgotten
or
ceased
to
love
her
mother
and
father
or
wish
to
visit
her
home
the
steady
clearness
of
foresight
and
readiness
of
resource
which
were
often
spoken
of
as
being
specially
characteristic
of
reuben
vanderpoel
were
all
required
and
employed
with
great
tenderness
in
the
management
of
this
situation
as
little
as
it
was
possible
that
his
wife
should
know
was
the
utmost
she
must
hear
and
be
hurt
by
unless
ensuing
events
compelled
further
revelations
the
rest
of
it
should
be
kept
from
her
as
further
protection
her
husband
had
frankly
asked
her
to
content
herself
with
a
degree
of
limited
information
i
have
meant
all
our
lives
annie
to
keep
from
you
the
unpleasant
things
a
woman
need
not
be
troubled
with
he
had
said
i
promised
myself
i
would
when
you
were
a
girl
i
knew
you
would
face
things
if
i
needed
your
help
but
you
were
a
gentle
little
soul
like
rosy
and
i
never
intended
that
you
should
bear
what
was
useless
anstruthers
was
a
blackguard
and
girls
of
all
nations
have
married
blackguards
before
when
you
have
rosy
safe
at
home
and
know
nothing
can
hurt
her
again
you
both
may
feel
you
would
like
to
talk
it
over
till
then
we
wo
go
into
detail
you
trust
me
i
know
when
i
tell
you
that
you
shall
hold
rosy
in
your
arms
very
soon
we
may
have
something
of
a
fight
but
there
can
only
be
one
end
to
it
in
a
country
as
decent
as
england
anstruthers
is
exactly
what
i
should
call
an
englishman
men
rather
like
him
are
to
be
found
in
two
or
three
his
shrewd
elderly
face
lighted
with
a
fine
smile
my
handsome
betty
has
saved
us
a
good
deal
by
carrying
out
her
plan
of
going
to
find
her
sister
he
ended
before
they
landed
they
had
decided
that
vanderpoel
should
be
comfortably
established
in
a
hotel
in
london
and
that
after
this
was
arranged
her
husband
should
go
to
stornham
court
alone
if
sir
nigel
could
be
induced
to
listen
to
logic
rosalie
her
child
and
betty
should
come
at
once
to
town
and
if
he
wo
listen
to
logic
added
vanderpoel
with
a
dry
composure
they
shall
come
just
the
same
my
and
his
wife
put
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
kissed
him
because
she
knew
what
he
said
was
quite
true
and
she
admired
him
as
she
had
always
done
greatly
but
when
the
pilot
came
on
board
and
there
began
to
stir
in
the
ship
the
agreeable
and
exciting
bustle
of
the
delivery
of
letters
and
welcoming
telegrams
among
vanderpoel
many
yellow
envelopes
he
opened
one
the
contents
of
which
caused
him
to
stand
still
for
some
moments
so
still
indeed
that
some
of
the
bystanders
began
to
touch
each
elbows
and
whisper
he
certainly
read
the
message
two
or
three
times
before
he
folded
it
up
returned
it
to
its
receptacle
and
walked
gravely
to
his
wife
reuben
she
exclaimed
after
her
first
look
at
him
have
you
bad
news
oh
i
hope
not
he
came
and
sat
down
quietly
beside
her
taking
her
hand
do
be
frightened
annie
my
dear
he
said
i
have
just
been
reminded
of
a
verse
in
the
bible
about
vengeance
not
belonging
to
mere
human
beings
nigel
anstruthers
has
had
a
stroke
of
paralysis
and
it
is
not
his
first
apparently
even
if
he
lies
on
his
back
for
some
months
thinking
of
harm
he
wo
be
able
to
do
it
he
is
when
he
was
carried
by
the
express
train
through
the
country
he
saw
all
that
betty
had
seen
though
the
summer
had
passed
and
there
were
neither
green
trees
nor
hedges
he
knew
all
that
the
long
letters
had
meant
of
stirred
emotion
and
affection
and
he
was
strongly
moved
though
his
mind
was
full
of
many
things
there
were
the
farmhouses
the
churches
the
hop
oasts
and
the
village
children
how
distinctly
she
had
made
him
see
them
his
betty
his
splendid
betty
his
heart
beat
at
the
thought
of
seeing
her
high
young
black
head
and
holding
her
safe
in
his
arms
again
safe
he
resented
having
used
the
word
because
there
was
a
shock
in
seeming
to
admit
the
possibility
that
anything
in
the
universe
could
do
wrong
to
her
yet
one
man
had
been
villain
enough
to
mean
her
harm
and
to
threaten
her
with
it
he
slightly
shuddered
as
he
thought
of
how
the
man
was
finished
done
for
the
train
began
to
puff
more
loudly
as
it
slackened
its
pace
it
was
drawing
near
to
a
rustic
little
station
and
as
it
passed
in
he
saw
a
carriage
standing
outside
waiting
on
the
road
and
a
footman
in
a
long
coat
glancing
into
each
window
as
the
train
went
by
two
or
three
country
people
were
watching
it
intently
miss
vanderpoel
father
was
coming
up
from
london
on
it
the
stationmaster
rushed
to
open
the
carriage
door
and
the
footman
hastened
forward
but
a
tall
lovely
thing
in
grey
was
opposite
the
step
as
vanderpoel
descended
it
to
the
platform
she
did
not
recognise
the
presence
of
any
other
human
being
than
himself
for
the
moment
she
seemed
to
forget
even
the
man
who
had
plainly
come
with
her
as
reuben
vanderpoel
folded
her
in
his
arms
she
folded
him
and
kissed
him
as
he
was
not
sure
she
had
ever
kissed
him
before
my
splendid
betty
my
own
fine
girl
he
said
and
when
she
cried
out
father
father
she
bent
and
kissed
the
breast
of
his
coat
he
knew
who
the
big
young
man
was
before
she
turned
to
present
him
this
is
lord
mount
dunstan
father
she
said
since
nigel
was
brought
home
he
has
been
very
good
to
reuben
vanderpoel
looked
well
into
the
man
eyes
as
he
shook
hands
with
him
warmly
and
this
was
what
he
said
to
himself
yes
she
safe
this
is
quite
safe
it
is
to
be
trusted
with
the
whole
not
many
days
after
her
husband
arrival
at
stornham
court
vanderpoel
travelled
down
from
london
and
during
her
journey
scarcely
saw
the
wintry
hedges
and
bare
trees
because
as
she
sat
in
her
cushioned
corner
of
the
railway
carriage
she
was
inwardly
offering
up
gentle
pathetically
ardent
prayers
of
gratitude
she
was
the
woman
who
prays
and
the
many
sad
petitions
of
the
past
years
were
being
answered
at
last
she
was
being
allowed
to
go
to
rosy
whatsoever
happened
she
could
never
be
really
parted
from
her
girl
again
she
asked
pardon
many
times
because
she
had
not
been
able
to
be
really
sorry
when
she
had
heard
of
her
desperate
condition
she
could
feel
pity
for
him
in
his
awful
case
she
told
herself
but
she
could
not
wish
for
the
thing
which
perhaps
she
ought
to
wish
for
she
had
confided
this
to
her
husband
with
innocent
penitent
tears
and
he
had
stroked
her
cheek
which
had
always
been
his
comforting
way
since
they
had
been
young
things
together
my
dear
he
said
if
a
tiger
with
hydrophobia
were
loose
among
a
lot
of
decent
people
or
indecent
ones
for
the
matter
of
that
you
would
not
feel
it
your
duty
to
be
very
sorry
if
in
springing
on
a
group
of
them
he
impaled
himself
on
an
iron
fence
do
reproach
yourself
too
and
though
the
realism
of
the
picture
he
presented
was
such
as
to
make
her
exclaim
no
no
there
were
still
occasional
moments
when
she
breathed
a
request
for
pardon
if
she
was
hard
of
heart
this
softest
of
creatures
human
it
was
arranged
by
the
two
who
best
knew
and
loved
her
that
her
meeting
with
rosalie
should
have
no
spectators
and
that
their
first
hour
together
should
be
wholly
unbroken
in
upon
you
have
not
seen
each
other
for
so
long
betty
said
when
on
her
arrival
she
led
her
at
once
to
the
where
rosy
waited
pale
with
joy
but
when
the
door
was
opened
though
the
two
figures
were
swept
into
each
other
arms
by
one
wild
tremulous
rush
of
movement
there
were
no
sounds
to
be
heard
only
caught
breaths
until
the
door
had
closed
again
the
talks
which
took
place
between
vanderpoel
and
lord
mount
dunstan
were
many
and
long
and
were
of
absorbing
interest
to
both
each
presented
to
the
other
a
new
world
and
a
type
of
which
his
previous
knowledge
had
been
but
incomplete
i
wonder
vanderpoel
said
in
the
course
of
one
of
them
if
my
world
appeals
to
you
as
yours
appeals
to
me
naturally
from
your
standpoint
it
scarcely
seems
probable
perhaps
the
of
large
financial
schemes
presupposes
a
certain
degree
of
imagination
i
am
becoming
a
romantic
new
york
man
of
business
and
i
revel
in
it
kedgers
for
instance
with
the
smile
which
somehow
suggested
betty
kedgers
and
the
lilium
giganteum
welden
and
old
doby
threaten
to
develop
into
quite
necessary
factors
in
the
scheme
of
happiness
what
betty
has
felt
is
even
more
comprehensible
than
it
seemed
at
they
walked
and
rode
together
about
the
countryside
when
mount
dunstan
itself
was
swept
clean
of
danger
and
only
a
few
convalescents
lingered
to
be
taken
care
of
in
the
huge
ballroom
they
spent
many
days
in
going
over
the
estate
the
desolate
beauty
of
it
appealed
to
and
touched
vanderpoel
as
it
had
appealed
to
and
touched
his
daughter
and
also
wakened
in
him
much
new
and
curious
delight
but
mount
dunstan
with
a
touch
of
his
old
obstinacy
insisted
that
he
should
ignore
the
beauty
and
look
closely
at
less
admirable
things
you
must
see
the
worst
of
this
he
said
you
must
understand
that
i
can
put
no
good
face
upon
things
that
i
offer
nothing
because
i
have
nothing
to
if
he
had
not
been
swept
through
and
through
by
a
powerful
and
rapturous
passion
he
would
have
detested
and
abhorred
these
days
of
deliberate
proud
laying
bare
of
the
nakedness
of
the
land
but
in
the
hours
he
spent
with
betty
vanderpoel
the
passion
gave
him
knowledge
of
the
things
which
being
elemental
do
not
concern
themselves
with
pride
and
obstinacy
and
do
not
remember
them
too
much
had
ended
and
too
much
begun
to
leave
space
or
thought
for
poor
things
in
their
eyes
when
they
were
together
and
even
when
they
were
apart
dwelt
a
glow
which
was
deeply
moving
to
those
who
looking
on
were
sufficiently
profound
of
thought
to
understand
watching
the
two
walking
slowly
side
by
side
down
the
leafless
avenue
on
a
crystal
winter
day
vanderpoel
conversed
with
the
vicar
whom
he
greatly
liked
a
young
man
of
the
name
of
selden
he
remarked
told
me
more
of
this
than
he
g
selden
said
the
vicar
with
affectionate
smiling
he
is
not
aware
that
he
was
largely
concerned
in
the
matter
in
fact
without
selden
i
do
not
know
how
exactly
we
should
have
got
on
how
is
he
nice
fellow
extremely
well
and
in
these
days
in
my
employ
he
is
of
the
honest
indefatigable
stuff
which
makes
its
his
own
smiles
as
he
watched
the
two
tall
figures
in
the
distance
settled
into
an
expression
of
speculative
absorption
because
he
was
reflecting
upon
profoundly
interesting
matters
there
is
a
great
primeval
thing
which
sometimes
not
often
only
sometimes
occurs
to
two
people
he
went
on
when
it
leaps
into
being
it
is
well
if
it
is
not
thwarted
or
done
to
death
it
has
happened
to
my
girl
and
mount
dunstan
if
they
had
been
two
young
tinkers
by
the
roadside
they
would
have
come
together
and
defied
their
beggary
as
it
is
i
recognise
as
i
sit
here
that
the
outcome
of
what
is
to
be
may
reach
far
and
open
up
broad
new
yes
said
the
vicar
she
will
live
here
and
fill
a
strong
man
life
with
wonderful
human
happiness
her
splendid
children
will
be
born
here
and
among
them
will
be
those
who
lead
the
van
and
make
for
some
time
nigel
anstruthers
lay
in
his
room
at
stornham
court
surrounded
by
all
of
aid
and
luxury
that
wealth
and
exalted
medical
science
could
gather
about
him
sometimes
he
lay
a
livid
unconscious
mask
sometimes
his
nurses
and
doctors
knew
that
in
his
hollow
eyes
there
was
the
light
of
a
raging
half
reason
and
they
saw
that
he
struggled
to
utter
coherent
sounds
which
they
might
comprehend
this
he
never
accomplished
and
one
day
in
the
midst
of
such
an
effort
he
was
stricken
dumb
again
and
soon
afterwards
sank
into
stillness
and
died
and
the
shuttle
in
the
hand
of
fate
through
every
hour
of
every
day
and
through
the
slow
deep
breathing
of
all
the
silent
nights
weaves
to
and
fro
to
and
fro
drawing
with
it
the
threads
of
human
life
and
thought
which
strengthen
its
web
and
trace
the
figures
of
its
yet
vague
and
uncompleted
design
