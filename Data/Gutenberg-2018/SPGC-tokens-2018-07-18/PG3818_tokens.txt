introduction
when
in
october
i
sailed
into
the
harbour
of
apia
samoa
in
the
albatross
mr
louis
becke
was
gaining
his
first
experiences
of
island
life
as
a
trader
on
his
own
account
by
running
a
cutter
between
apia
and
it
was
rather
a
notable
moment
in
apia
for
two
reasons
in
the
first
place
the
german
traders
were
shaking
in
their
shoes
for
fear
of
what
the
french
squadron
might
do
to
them
and
we
were
the
bearers
of
the
good
news
from
tahiti
that
the
chivalrous
admiral
clouet
with
a
very
proper
magnanimity
had
decided
not
to
molest
them
and
secondly
the
beach
was
still
seething
with
excitement
over
the
departure
on
the
previous
day
of
the
pirate
pease
carrying
with
him
the
yet
more
illustrious
bully
hayes
it
happened
in
this
wise
a
month
or
two
before
our
arrival
hayes
had
dropped
anchor
in
apia
and
some
ugly
stories
of
recent
irregularities
in
the
labour
trade
had
come
to
the
ears
of
mr
williams
the
english
consul
mr
williams
with
the
assistance
of
the
natives
very
cleverly
seized
his
vessel
in
the
night
and
ran
her
ashore
and
detained
mr
hayes
pending
the
arrival
of
an
english
to
which
he
could
be
given
in
charge
but
in
those
happy
days
there
were
no
prisons
in
samoa
so
that
his
confinement
was
not
irksome
and
his
only
hard
labour
was
picnics
of
which
he
was
the
life
and
soul
all
went
pleasantly
until
mr
pease
a
degenerate
sort
of
pirate
who
made
his
living
by
half
bullying
half
swindling
lonely
white
men
on
small
islands
out
of
their
coconut
oil
and
unarmed
merchantmen
out
of
their
stores
came
to
apia
in
an
armed
ship
with
a
malay
crew
from
that
moment
hayes
life
became
less
idyllic
hayes
and
pease
conceived
a
most
violent
hatred
of
each
other
and
poor
old
mr
williams
was
really
worried
into
an
attack
of
elephantiasis
which
answers
to
the
gout
in
those
latitudes
by
his
continual
efforts
to
prevent
the
two
desperadoes
from
flying
at
each
other
throat
heartily
glad
was
he
when
pease
who
was
the
sort
of
man
that
always
observed
les
convenances
when
possible
and
who
fired
a
salute
of
guns
on
the
queen
birthday
came
one
afternoon
to
get
his
papers
all
regular
and
clear
for
sea
but
lo
the
next
morning
when
his
vessel
had
disappeared
it
was
found
that
his
enemy
captain
hayes
had
disappeared
also
and
the
ladies
of
samoa
were
left
disconsolate
at
the
departure
of
the
most
agreeable
man
they
had
ever
known
however
all
this
is
another
story
as
mr
kipling
says
and
one
which
i
hope
mr
becke
will
tell
us
more
fully
some
day
for
he
knew
hayes
well
having
acted
as
supercargo
on
board
his
ship
and
shared
a
shipwreck
and
other
adventures
with
him
but
even
before
this
date
mr
becke
had
had
as
much
experience
as
falls
to
most
men
of
adventures
in
the
pacific
ocean
born
at
port
macquarrie
in
australia
where
his
father
was
clerk
of
petty
sessions
he
was
seized
at
the
age
of
fourteen
with
an
intense
longing
to
go
to
sea
it
is
possible
that
he
inherited
this
passion
through
his
mother
for
her
father
charles
beilby
who
was
private
secretary
to
the
duke
of
cumberland
invested
a
legacy
that
fell
to
him
in
a
small
vessel
and
sailed
with
his
family
to
the
then
very
new
world
of
australia
however
this
may
be
it
was
impossible
to
keep
louis
becke
at
home
and
as
an
alternative
a
uncle
undertook
to
send
him
and
a
brother
two
years
older
to
a
mercantile
house
in
california
his
first
voyage
was
a
terrible
one
there
were
no
steamers
of
course
in
those
days
and
they
sailed
for
san
francisco
in
a
wretched
old
barque
for
over
a
month
they
were
drifting
about
the
stormy
sea
between
australia
and
new
zealand
a
partially
dismasted
and
leaking
wreck
the
crew
mutinied
they
had
bitter
cause
to
and
only
after
calling
at
rurutu
in
the
tubuai
group
and
obtaining
fresh
food
did
they
permit
the
captain
to
resume
command
of
the
old
craft
they
were
ninety
days
in
reaching
honolulu
and
another
forty
in
making
the
californian
coast
the
two
lads
did
not
find
the
routine
of
a
merchant
office
at
all
to
their
taste
and
while
the
elder
obtained
employment
on
a
sheep
ranche
at
san
juan
louis
still
faithful
to
the
sea
got
a
berth
as
a
clerk
in
a
steamship
company
and
traded
to
the
southern
ports
in
a
time
he
had
money
enough
to
take
passage
in
a
schooner
bound
on
a
cruise
to
the
equatorial
islands
of
the
north
pacific
the
life
was
a
very
rough
one
and
full
of
incident
and
adventure
which
i
hope
he
will
relate
some
day
returning
to
honolulu
he
fell
in
with
an
old
captain
who
had
bought
a
schooner
for
a
trading
venture
amongst
the
western
carolines
becke
put
in
and
sailed
with
him
as
supercargo
he
and
the
skipper
being
the
only
white
men
on
board
he
soon
discovered
that
though
a
good
seaman
the
old
man
knew
nothing
of
navigation
in
a
few
weeks
they
were
among
the
marshall
islands
and
the
captain
went
mad
from
delirium
tremens
becke
and
the
three
native
sailors
ran
the
vessel
into
a
little
uninhabited
atoll
and
for
a
week
had
to
keep
the
captain
tied
up
to
prevent
his
killing
himself
they
got
him
right
at
last
and
stood
to
the
westward
on
their
voyage
they
were
witnesses
of
a
tragedy
in
this
instance
fortunately
not
complete
on
which
the
pitiless
sun
of
the
pacific
has
looked
down
very
often
they
fell
in
with
a
big
marshall
island
sailing
canoe
that
had
been
blown
out
of
sight
of
land
and
had
drifted
six
hundred
miles
to
the
westward
out
of
her
complement
of
fifty
people
thirty
were
dead
they
gave
them
provisions
and
water
and
left
them
to
make
strong
island
kusaie
which
was
in
sight
becke
and
the
chief
swore
marshall
island
bruderschaft
with
each
other
years
afterwards
when
he
came
to
live
in
the
marshall
group
the
chief
proved
his
friendship
in
a
signal
manner
the
cruise
proved
a
profitable
one
and
from
that
time
mr
becke
determined
to
become
a
trader
and
to
learn
to
know
the
people
of
the
pacific
and
returning
to
california
he
made
for
samoa
and
from
thence
to
sydney
but
at
this
time
the
palmer
river
gold
rush
had
just
broken
out
in
north
queensland
and
a
brother
who
was
a
bank
manager
on
the
celebrated
charters
towers
goldfields
invited
him
to
come
up
as
every
one
seemed
to
be
making
his
fortune
he
wandered
between
the
rushes
for
two
years
not
making
a
fortune
but
acquiring
much
useful
experience
learning
amongst
other
things
the
art
of
a
blacksmith
and
becoming
a
crack
shot
with
a
rifle
returning
to
sydney
he
sailed
for
the
friendly
islands
tonga
in
company
with
the
king
of
tonga
yacht
the
taufaahau
the
friendly
islanders
disappointed
him
at
which
no
one
that
knows
them
will
wonder
and
he
went
on
to
samoa
and
set
up
as
a
trader
on
his
own
account
for
the
first
time
he
and
a
manhiki
the
allan
who
so
frequently
figures
in
his
stories
bought
a
cutter
and
went
trading
throughout
the
group
this
was
the
time
of
colonel
steinberger
brief
tenure
of
power
the
natives
were
fighting
and
the
cutter
was
seized
on
two
occasions
when
the
war
was
over
he
made
a
voyage
to
the
and
became
a
great
favourite
with
the
natives
as
indeed
seems
to
have
been
the
case
in
most
of
the
places
he
went
to
in
polynesia
and
micronesia
later
on
he
was
sent
away
from
samoa
in
charge
of
a
vessel
under
sealed
orders
to
the
marshall
islands
these
orders
were
to
hand
the
vessel
over
to
the
notorious
captain
bully
hayes
some
day
he
promises
that
he
will
give
us
the
details
of
this
very
curious
adventure
he
found
hayes
awaiting
him
in
his
famous
brig
leonora
in
milli
lagoon
he
handed
over
his
charge
and
took
service
with
him
as
supercargo
after
some
months
cruising
in
the
carolines
they
were
wrecked
on
strong
island
kusaie
hayes
made
himself
the
ruler
of
the
island
and
mr
becke
and
he
had
a
bitter
quarrel
the
natives
treated
the
latter
with
great
kindness
and
gave
him
land
on
the
lee
side
of
the
island
where
he
lived
happily
enough
for
five
months
hayes
was
captured
by
an
english
but
escaped
and
went
to
guam
mr
becke
went
back
in
the
cruiser
to
the
colonies
and
then
again
sailed
for
eastern
polynesia
trading
in
the
gambiers
paumotus
and
easter
and
pitcairn
islands
in
this
part
of
the
ocean
he
picked
up
an
abandoned
french
barque
on
a
reef
floated
her
and
loaded
her
with
coconuts
intending
to
sail
her
to
new
zealand
with
a
native
crew
but
they
went
ashore
in
a
hurricane
and
lost
everything
meeting
with
mr
tom
de
wolf
the
managing
partner
of
a
liverpool
firm
he
took
service
with
him
as
a
trader
in
the
ellice
and
tokelau
groups
finally
settling
down
as
a
residential
trader
then
he
took
passage
once
more
for
the
carolines
and
was
wrecked
on
peru
one
of
the
gilbert
islands
lately
annexed
losing
every
dollar
that
he
possessed
he
returned
to
samoa
and
engaged
as
a
recruiter
in
the
labour
trade
he
got
badly
hurt
in
an
encounter
with
some
natives
and
went
to
new
zealand
to
recover
then
he
sailed
to
new
britain
on
a
trading
venture
and
fell
in
with
and
had
much
to
do
with
the
colonising
expedition
of
the
marquis
de
ray
in
new
ireland
a
bad
attack
of
malarial
fever
and
a
wound
in
the
neck
labour
recruiting
or
even
trading
among
the
blacks
of
melanesia
seems
to
have
been
a
much
less
pleasant
business
than
residence
among
the
gentle
brown
folk
of
the
eastern
pacific
made
him
leave
and
return
to
the
marshall
islands
where
lailik
the
chief
whom
he
had
succoured
at
sea
years
before
made
him
welcome
he
left
on
a
fruitless
quest
after
an
imaginary
guano
island
and
from
then
until
two
years
ago
he
has
been
living
on
various
islands
in
both
the
north
and
south
pacific
leading
what
he
calls
a
wandering
and
lonely
but
not
unhappy
existence
lui
as
they
call
him
being
a
man
both
liked
and
trusted
by
the
natives
from
lonely
easter
island
to
the
faraway
pelews
he
is
still
in
the
prime
of
life
and
whether
he
will
now
remain
within
the
bounds
of
civilisation
or
whether
some
day
he
will
return
to
his
wanderings
as
odysseus
is
fabled
to
have
done
in
his
old
age
i
fancy
that
he
hardly
knows
himself
but
when
once
the
charm
of
a
wild
roving
life
has
got
into
a
man
blood
the
trammels
of
civilisation
are
irksome
and
its
atmosphere
is
hard
to
breathe
it
will
be
seen
from
this
sketch
of
mr
becke
career
that
he
knows
the
pacific
as
few
men
alive
or
dead
have
ever
known
it
he
is
one
of
the
rare
men
who
have
led
a
very
wild
life
and
have
the
culture
and
talent
necessary
to
give
some
account
of
it
as
a
rule
the
men
who
know
write
and
the
men
who
write
do
know
every
one
who
has
a
taste
for
good
stories
will
feel
i
believe
the
force
of
these
every
one
who
knows
the
south
seas
and
i
believe
many
who
do
not
will
feel
that
they
have
the
unmistakable
stamp
of
truth
and
truth
to
nature
is
a
great
merit
in
a
story
not
only
because
of
that
thrill
of
pleasure
hard
to
analyse
but
largely
made
up
of
associations
memories
and
suggestions
that
faithfulness
of
representation
in
picture
or
book
gives
to
the
natural
man
but
because
of
the
fact
that
nature
is
almost
infinitely
rich
and
the
unassisted
imagination
of
man
but
a
poor
and
sterile
thing
tending
constantly
towards
some
ossified
convention
treasure
island
is
a
much
better
story
than
the
wreckers
yet
i
for
one
shall
never
cease
to
regret
that
mr
stevenson
did
not
possess
when
he
wrote
treasure
island
that
knowledge
of
what
men
and
schooners
do
in
wild
seas
that
was
his
when
he
gave
us
the
wreckers
the
detail
would
have
been
so
much
richer
and
more
convincing
it
is
open
to
any
one
to
say
that
these
tales
are
barbarous
and
what
mrs
meynell
in
a
very
clever
and
amusing
essay
has
called
decivilised
certainly
there
is
a
wide
gulf
separating
life
on
a
pacific
island
from
the
accumulated
culture
of
centuries
of
civilisation
in
the
midst
of
which
such
as
mrs
meynell
move
and
have
their
being
and
if
there
can
be
nothing
good
in
literature
that
does
not
spring
from
that
culture
these
stories
must
stand
condemned
but
such
a
view
is
surely
too
narrow
much
as
i
admire
that
writings
i
never
can
think
of
a
world
from
which
everything
was
eliminated
that
did
not
commend
itself
to
the
dainty
taste
of
herself
and
her
friends
without
a
feeling
of
impatience
and
suffocation
it
takes
a
huge
variety
of
men
and
things
to
make
a
good
world
and
ranches
and
canons
veldts
and
prairies
tropical
forests
and
coral
islands
and
all
that
goes
to
make
up
the
wild
life
in
the
face
of
nature
or
among
primitive
races
far
and
free
from
the
artificial
conditions
of
an
elaborate
civilisation
form
an
element
in
the
world
the
loss
of
which
would
be
bitterly
felt
by
many
a
man
who
has
never
set
foot
outside
his
native
land
there
is
a
certain
monotony
perhaps
about
these
stories
to
some
extent
this
is
inevitable
the
interest
and
passions
of
south
sea
island
life
are
neither
numerous
nor
complex
and
action
is
apt
to
be
rapid
and
direct
a
novelist
of
that
modern
school
that
fills
its
volumes
often
fascinatingly
enough
by
refining
upon
the
shadowy
refinements
of
civilised
thought
and
feeling
would
find
it
hard
to
ply
his
trade
in
south
sea
island
society
his
models
would
always
be
cutting
short
in
five
minutes
the
hesitations
and
subtleties
that
ought
to
have
lasted
them
through
a
quarter
of
a
but
i
think
it
is
possible
that
the
english
reader
might
gather
from
this
little
book
an
unduly
strong
impression
of
the
uniformity
of
island
life
the
loves
of
white
men
and
brown
women
often
cynical
and
brutal
sometimes
exquisitely
tender
and
pathetic
necessarily
fill
a
large
space
in
any
true
picture
of
the
south
sea
islands
and
mr
becke
no
doubt
of
set
artistic
purpose
has
confined
himself
in
the
collection
of
tales
now
offered
almost
entirely
to
this
facet
of
the
life
i
do
not
question
that
he
is
right
in
deciding
to
detract
nothing
from
the
striking
effect
of
these
powerful
stories
taken
as
a
whole
by
interspersing
amongst
them
others
of
a
different
character
but
i
hope
it
may
be
remembered
that
the
present
selection
is
only
an
instalment
and
that
if
it
finds
favour
with
the
british
public
we
may
expect
from
him
some
of
those
tales
of
adventure
and
of
purely
native
life
and
custom
which
no
one
could
tell
so
well
as
he
pembroke
challis
the
doubter
the
white
lady
and
the
brown
woman
four
years
had
come
and
gone
since
the
day
that
challis
with
a
dull
and
savage
misery
in
his
heart
had
cursing
the
which
once
possessed
him
walked
out
from
his
house
in
an
australian
city
with
an
undefined
and
vague
purpose
of
going
somewhere
to
drown
his
sense
of
wrong
and
erase
from
his
memory
the
face
of
the
woman
who
his
wife
of
not
yet
a
year
had
played
with
her
honour
and
his
so
he
thought
anyhow
you
see
challis
was
a
fool
at
least
so
his
pretty
wife
had
told
him
that
afternoon
with
a
bitter
and
contemptuous
ring
in
her
voice
when
he
had
brought
another
man
letter
written
to
her
and
with
impulsive
and
jealous
haste
had
asked
her
to
explain
he
was
a
fool
she
had
said
with
an
angry
gleam
in
the
violet
eyes
to
think
she
could
not
take
care
of
herself
admit
receiving
that
letter
of
course
did
he
think
she
could
help
other
men
writing
silly
letters
to
her
did
he
not
think
she
could
keep
out
of
a
mess
and
she
smiled
the
smile
of
a
woman
conscious
of
many
admirers
and
of
her
own
powers
of
intrigue
then
challis
with
a
big
effort
gulping
down
the
rage
that
stirred
him
made
his
great
mistake
he
spoke
of
his
love
for
her
fatuity
she
laughed
at
him
said
that
as
she
detested
women
his
love
was
too
exacting
for
her
if
it
meant
that
she
should
never
be
commonly
friendly
with
any
other
man
challis
looked
at
her
steadily
for
a
few
moments
trying
to
smother
the
wild
flood
of
black
suspicion
aroused
in
him
by
the
discovery
of
the
letter
and
confirmed
by
her
sneering
words
and
then
said
quietly
but
with
a
dangerous
inflection
in
his
voice
remember
you
are
my
wife
if
you
have
no
regard
for
your
own
reputation
you
shall
have
some
for
mine
i
do
want
to
entertain
my
friends
by
thrashing
r
but
i
not
such
a
fool
as
you
think
and
if
you
go
further
in
this
direction
you
find
me
a
bit
of
a
brute
again
the
sneering
laugh
indeed
something
very
tragic
will
occur
i
suppose
no
said
challis
grimly
something
damned
prosaic
common
enough
among
men
with
pretty
wives
i
clear
out
i
wish
you
would
do
that
now
said
his
wife
i
hate
you
quite
enough
of
course
she
did
quite
mean
it
she
really
liked
challis
in
her
own
way
principally
because
his
money
had
given
her
the
social
pleasures
denied
her
during
her
girlhood
with
an
unmoved
face
and
without
farewell
he
left
her
and
went
to
his
lawyer
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
he
arose
to
go
and
the
lawyer
asked
him
when
he
intended
returning
that
all
depends
upon
her
if
she
wants
me
back
again
she
can
write
through
you
and
i
come
if
she
has
conducted
herself
with
a
reasonable
amount
of
propriety
for
such
a
pretty
woman
then
with
an
ugly
look
on
his
face
challis
went
out
next
day
he
embarked
in
the
lady
alicia
for
a
six
months
cruise
among
the
islands
of
the
pacific
that
was
four
years
ago
and
challis
who
stands
working
at
a
little
table
set
in
against
an
open
window
hammering
out
a
ring
from
a
silver
coin
on
a
and
vyce
whistles
softly
and
contentedly
to
himself
as
he
raises
his
head
and
glances
through
the
vista
of
coconuts
that
surround
his
dwelling
on
this
lonely
and
almost
forgotten
island
the
devil
he
thinks
to
himself
i
must
be
turning
into
a
native
four
years
what
an
ass
i
was
and
i
never
written
yet
that
is
never
sent
a
letter
away
well
neither
has
she
perhaps
after
all
there
was
little
in
that
affair
of
r
by
god
though
if
there
was
i
been
very
good
to
them
in
leaving
them
a
clear
field
anyhow
she
all
right
as
regards
money
i
glad
i
done
that
a
big
prop
to
a
man
conscience
to
feel
he
has
done
anything
mean
and
she
likes
money
most
women
do
of
course
i
go
back
if
she
writes
if
not
well
then
these
sinful
islands
can
claim
me
for
their
own
that
is
nalia
can
a
native
boy
with
shaven
head
save
for
a
long
tuft
on
the
left
side
came
down
from
the
village
and
seating
himself
on
the
gravelled
space
inside
the
fence
gazed
at
the
white
man
with
full
lustrous
eyes
hallo
tama
said
challis
whither
goest
now
pardon
tialli
i
came
to
look
at
thee
making
the
ring
is
it
of
soft
silver
and
for
nalia
thy
wife
ay
o
it
is
here
take
this
masi
and
go
pluck
me
a
young
nut
to
drink
and
challis
threw
him
a
then
he
went
on
tapping
the
little
band
of
silver
he
had
already
forgotten
the
violet
eyes
and
was
thinking
with
almost
childish
eagerness
of
the
soft
glow
in
the
black
orbs
of
nalia
when
she
should
see
his
finished
handiwork
the
boy
returned
with
a
young
coconut
unhusked
behold
tialli
this
nut
is
a
uto
sweet
husk
when
thou
hast
drunk
the
juice
give
it
me
back
that
i
may
chew
the
husk
which
is
sweet
as
the
of
samoa
and
he
squatted
down
again
on
the
gravel
challis
drank
then
threw
him
the
husk
and
resumed
his
work
presently
the
boy
tearing
off
a
strip
of
the
husk
with
his
white
teeth
said
tialli
how
is
it
that
there
be
no
in
thy
house
because
o
my
wife
is
away
and
there
are
no
men
in
the
village
and
because
the
women
of
this
motu
island
or
country
i
have
no
thought
that
the
papalagi
foreigner
may
be
parched
with
thirst
and
so
come
not
near
me
with
a
coconut
this
latter
in
jest
nay
tialli
not
so
true
it
is
that
all
the
men
are
in
the
bush
binding
fala
leaves
around
the
coconut
trees
else
do
the
rats
steal
up
and
eat
the
buds
and
clusters
of
little
nuts
and
because
nalia
thy
wife
is
away
at
the
other
white
man
house
no
woman
cometh
inside
the
door
challis
laughed
o
people
of
nukunono
and
must
i
thy
papalagi
be
parched
with
thirst
because
of
this
faiaga
oe
tialli
thou
but
playest
with
me
raise
thy
hand
and
call
out
thirst
and
every
woman
in
the
village
will
run
to
thee
each
with
a
and
those
that
desire
thee
but
are
afraid
will
give
two
but
to
come
inside
when
nalia
is
away
would
be
to
put
shame
on
her
the
white
man
mused
the
boy
solemn
chatter
entertained
him
he
knew
well
the
native
customs
but
to
torment
the
boy
he
commenced
again
o
foolish
custom
see
how
i
trust
my
wife
nalia
is
she
not
even
now
in
the
house
of
another
white
man
true
but
then
he
is
old
and
feeble
and
thou
young
and
strong
none
but
a
fool
desires
to
eat
a
dried
when
a
fresh
one
may
be
had
o
wise
man
with
the
shaven
crown
said
challis
with
mocking
good
nature
thou
art
full
of
wisdom
of
the
ways
of
women
and
if
i
were
old
and
withered
would
nalia
then
be
false
to
me
in
a
house
of
another
and
younger
white
man
how
could
she
would
not
he
too
have
a
wife
who
would
watch
her
and
if
he
had
not
and
were
nofo
noa
single
would
he
be
such
a
fool
to
steal
that
the
like
of
which
he
can
buy
for
there
are
many
girls
without
husbands
as
good
to
look
on
as
that
nalia
of
thine
and
all
women
are
alike
and
then
hearing
a
woman
voice
calling
his
name
he
stood
up
farewell
o
ulu
tula
poto
wise
baldhead
said
challis
as
the
boy
still
chewing
his
sweet
husk
walked
back
to
the
native
houses
clustered
under
the
grove
of
pua
trees
ere
dusk
nalia
came
home
a
girl
with
big
dreamy
eyes
and
a
heavy
mantle
of
wavy
hair
a
white
muslin
gown
fastened
at
the
throat
with
a
small
silver
brooch
was
her
only
garment
save
the
folds
of
the
lava
lava
round
her
waist
which
the
garment
covered
challis
was
lying
down
when
she
came
in
two
girls
who
came
with
her
carried
baskets
of
cooked
food
presents
from
old
jack
kelly
at
a
sign
from
nalia
the
girls
took
one
of
the
baskets
of
food
and
went
away
then
taking
off
her
hat
of
fala
leaf
she
sat
down
beside
challis
and
pinched
his
cheek
o
lazy
one
to
let
me
walk
from
the
house
of
tiaki
all
alone
alone
there
were
two
others
with
thee
tapa
could
i
talk
to
them
i
a
white
man
wife
must
not
be
too
familiar
with
every
girl
else
they
would
seek
to
get
presents
from
me
with
sweet
words
besides
could
i
carry
home
the
fish
and
cooked
fowl
sent
thee
by
old
tiaki
that
would
be
unbecoming
to
me
even
as
it
would
be
if
thou
climbed
a
tree
for
a
coconut
and
the
daughter
of
the
tropics
laughed
merrily
as
she
patted
challis
on
his
sunburnt
cheek
challis
rose
and
going
to
a
little
table
took
from
it
the
ring
see
nalia
i
am
not
lazy
as
thou
sayest
this
is
thine
the
girl
with
an
eager
aue
took
the
bauble
and
placed
it
on
her
finger
she
made
a
pretty
picture
standing
there
in
the
last
glow
of
the
sun
as
it
sank
into
the
ocean
her
languorous
eyes
filled
with
a
tender
light
challis
sitting
on
the
end
of
the
table
regarding
her
with
interest
as
does
a
man
watching
a
child
with
a
toy
suddenly
flushed
hotly
by
god
i
ca
be
such
a
fool
as
to
begin
to
love
her
in
reality
but
yet
come
here
nalia
and
he
drew
her
to
him
and
turning
her
face
up
so
that
he
might
look
into
her
eyes
he
asked
nalia
hast
thou
ever
told
me
any
lies
the
steady
depths
of
those
dark
eyes
looked
back
into
his
and
she
answered
nay
i
fear
thee
too
much
to
lie
thou
mightst
kill
me
i
do
but
ask
thee
some
little
things
it
matters
not
to
me
what
the
answer
is
yet
see
that
thou
keepest
nothing
hidden
from
me
the
girl
with
parted
lips
and
one
hand
on
his
waited
before
thou
became
my
wife
nalia
hadst
thou
any
lovers
yes
two
kapua
and
and
since
may
i
choke
and
perish
here
before
thee
if
i
lie
none
challis
still
holding
her
soft
brown
chin
in
his
hand
asked
her
one
more
question
a
question
that
only
one
of
his
temperament
would
have
dared
to
ask
a
girl
of
the
tokelaus
nalia
dost
thou
love
me
aye
alofa
tumau
everlasting
love
am
i
a
fool

and
eline
the
daughter
of
old
tiaki
ready
to
come
to
this
house
if
i
love
any
but
thee
therefore
my
love
is
like
the
suckers
of
the
octopus
in
its
strength
my
mother
has
taught
me
much
wisdom
a
curious
feeling
of
satisfaction
possessed
the
man
and
next
day
letia
the
show
girl
of
the
village
visiting
challis
store
to
buy
a
tin
of
salmon
saw
nalia
the
lucky
one
seated
on
a
mat
beneath
the
seaward
side
of
the
trader
house
surrounded
by
a
billowy
pile
of
yellow
silk
diligently
sewing
ho
dear
friend
of
my
heart
is
that
silken
dress
for
thee

the
love
of
god

me
but

king
of
generosity

to
become
a
mother
away
silly
fool
and
do
thy
buying
and
pester
me
not
challis
coming
to
the
corner
of
the
house
leant
against
a
post
and
something
white
showed
in
his
hand
it
was
a
letter
his
letter
to
the
woman
of
violet
eyes
written
a
week
ago
in
the
idea
of
sending
it
some
day
he
read
it
through
and
then
paused
and
looked
at
nalia
she
raised
her
head
and
smiled
slowly
piece
by
piece
he
tore
it
into
tiny
little
squares
and
with
a
dreamy
threw
them
away
the
wind
held
them
in
for
a
moment
and
then
carried
the
little
white
flecks
to
the
beach
what
is
it
said
the
bubbling
voice
of
letia
the
disappointed
only
a
piece
of
paper
that
weighed
as
a
piece
of
iron
on
my
bosom
but
it
is
gone
now
even
so
said
letia
smelling
the
gaudy
label
on
the
tin
of
salmon
in
the
anticipative
ecstasy
of
a
true
polynesian
pe
se
mea
like
a
thing
buried
deep
in
ocean
may
god
send
me
a
white
man
as
generous
as
thee
a
whole
tin
of
samani
for
nothing
now
do
i
know
that
nalia
will
bear
thee
a
son
and
that
is
why

doubter

then
the
german

laughed
joyously
when
harry
the
canadian
said

and
have
a
high
time
and
held
out
her
soft
little
hand

he
bade
her
adieu
and
strolled
off
for
another
drink
the
moment
harry
had
gone
allan
was
a
new
man
pulling
off
his
straw
hat
he
saluted
her
in
samoan
and
then
opened
fire
there
are
many
teine
lalelei
beautiful
girls
in
the
world
but
there
is
none
so
beautiful
as
thou
only
truth
do
i
speak
for
i
have
been
to
all
countries
of
the
world
ask
him
who
is
here
our
supercargo
if
i
lie
o
maid
with
the
teeth
of
pearl
and
face
like
fetuao
the
morning
star
my
stomach
is
drying
up
with
the
fire
of
love
the
sunshade
came
a
little
lower
and
the
fingers
played
nervously
with
the
ivory
handle
i
leant
against
a
coconut
tree
and
listened
thy
name
is
vaega
see
that
how
do
i
know
aha
how
do
i
because
for
two
years
or
more
whenever
i
passed
by
the
stone
wall
of
the
sisters
dwelling
in
matafele
i
climbed
up
and
watched
thee
o
star
of
the
morning
and
i
heard
the
other
girls
call
thee
vaega
oho
and
some
night
i
meant
to
steal
thee
away
the
rascal
he
told
me
two
days
afterwards
that
the
only
time
he
ever
climbed
the
mission
wall
was
to
steal
mangoes
the
sunshade
was
tilted
back
and
displayed
two
big
black
eyes
luminous
with
admiring
wonder
and
so
thou
hast
left
samoa
to
come
here
to
be
devoured
by
this
fat
hog
of
a
dutchman
dost
thou
not
know
o
foolish
lovely
one
that
she
who
mates
with
a
siamani
german
grows
old
in
quite
a
little
time
and
thy
face
which
is
now
smooth
and
fair
will
be
coarse
as
the
rind
of
a
because
of
the
foul
food
these
swine
of
germans
eat
allan
i
called
here
the
captain
there
was
a
quick
clasp
of
hands
as
the
stalwart
one
and
the
maid
hurriedly
spoke
again
this
time
in
a
whisper
and
then
the
white
muslin
floated
away
out
of
sight
the
captain
was
what
he
called
no
so
dry
viz
over
and
very
jolly
he
told
allan
he
could
have
an
hour
to
himself
to
buy
what
he
wanted
and
then
told
me
that
the
captain
of
a
steam
collier
had
promised
to
give
us
a
tug
out
at
daylight
i
right
for
the
after
all
i
thought
but
the
wedding
never
came
off
that
night
oppermann
in
a
frantic
state
was
tearing
round
levuka
hunting
for
his
love
who
had
disappeared
at
daylight
as
the
collier
steamed
ahead
and
tautened
our
we
could
see
the
parties
of
searchers
with
torches
scouring
the
beach
our
native
sailors
said
they
had
heard
a
scream
about
ten
at
night
and
seen
the
sharks
splashing
and
the
white
liars
of
levuka
shook
their
heads
and
looked
solemn
as
they
told
tales
of
monster
sharks
with
jaws
always
cruising
close
in
to
the
shore
at
night
three
days
afterwards
allan
came
to
me
with
stolid
face
and
asked
for
a
bottle
of
wine
as
vaega
was
very
i
gave
him
the
wine
and
threatened
to
tell
the
captain
he
laughed
and
said
he
would
fight
any
man
captain
or
no
captain
who
meddled
with
him
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
felt
safe
the
skipper
valued
him
too
much
to
bully
him
over
the
mere
stealing
of
a
woman
so
the
limp
and
vaega
was
carried
up
out
of
the
sweating
and
given
a
cabin
berth
and
allan
planked
down
two
pieces
for
her
passage
to
the
union
group
when
she
got
better
she
sang
rowdy
songs
and
laughed
all
day
and
made
fun
of
the
holy
sisters
and
one
day
allan
beat
her
with
a
deal
board
because
she
sat
down
on
a
in
the
and
ruined
a
hat
belonging
to
a
swell
official
wife
in
apia
and
she
liked
him
all
the
better
for
it
the
fair
vaega
was
mrs
allan
for
just
six
months
when
his
erratic
fancy
was
captivated
by
the
daughter
of
mauga
the
chief
of
tutuila
and
an
elopement
resulted
to
the
mountains
the
subsequent
and
inevitable
parting
made
samoa
an
undesirable
place
of
residence
for
allan
who
shipped
as
boatsteerer
in
the
niger
of
new
bedford
as
for
vaega
she
drifted
back
to
apia
and
there
right
under
the
shadow
of
the
mission
church
she
flaunted
her
beauty
the
last
time
i
saw
her
was
in
charley
the
russian
saloon
when
she
showed
me
a
letter
it
was
from
the
bereaved
oppermann
asking
her
to
come
back
and
marry
him
are
you
going
i
said
e
pule
le
atua
if
god
so
wills
but
he
only
sent
me
twenty
dollars
and
that
is
half
enough
however
there
an
american
coming
next
week
and
these
other
girls
will
see
then
i
make
the
papalagi
foreign
officers
shell
out
to
fa
alii
the
revenge
of
macy
a
story
of
the
marquesas
tikena
the
clubfooted
guided
me
to
an
open
spot
in
the
and
sitting
down
on
the
butt
of
a
twisted
toa
indicated
by
a
sweep
of
his
tattooed
arm
the
lower
course
of
what
had
once
been
the
white
dwelling
like
unto
himself
was
this
his
house
he
said
puffing
a
dirty
clay
pipe
and
strong
and
the
walls
were
of
great
blocks
made
of
panisina
of
coral
and
lime
and
sand
mixed
together
and
around
each
posts
that
to
lift
one
took
the
strength
of
fifty
men
was
wound
two
thousand
fathoms
of
thin
plaited
cinnet
stained
red
and
black
apa
he
was
a
great
man
here
in
these
motu
islands
although
he
fled
from
prison
in
your
land
and
when
he
stepped
on
the
beach
the
marks
of
the
iron
bands
that
had
once
been
round
his
ankles
were
yet
red
to
the
sight
there
be
none
such
as
he
in
these
days
but
he
is
now
in
hell
this
was
the
funeral
oration
of
macy
sometime
member
of
the
of
port
arthur
in
van
dieman
land
and
subsequently
runaway
convict
beachcomber
of
whaleships
and
gentleman
of
leisure
in
eastern
polynesia
and
of
his
many
known
crimes
the
deed
done
in
this
isolated
spot
was
the
darkest
of
all
judge
of
it
yourself
the
arrowy
shafts
of
sunrise
had
scarce
pierced
the
deep
gloom
of
the
silent
forest
ere
the
village
woke
to
life
right
beside
the
dwelling
of
macy
now
a
man
of
might
there
towers
a
stately
tamanu
tree
and
as
the
first
faint
murmur
of
voices
arises
from
the
native
huts
there
is
a
responsive
twittering
and
cooing
in
the
branches
and
further
back
in
the
forest
the
heavy
booming
note
of
the
pigeon
sounds
forth
like
the
beat
of
a
muffled
drum
with
slow
languid
step
sera
the
wife
of
macy
comes
to
the
open
door
and
looks
out
upon
the
placid
lagoon
now
just
rippling
beneath
the
first
breath
of
the
and
longs
for
courage
to
go
out
there
there
to
the
point
of
the
reef
and
spring
over
among
the
sharks
the
girl
she
is
hardly
yet
a
woman
shudders
a
moment
and
passes
her
white
hand
before
her
eyes
and
then
with
a
sudden
gust
of
passion
the
hand
clenches
i
would
kill
him
kill
him
if
there
was
but
a
ship
here
in
which
i
could
get
away
i
would
sell
myself
over
and
over
again
to
the
worst
whaler
crew
that
ever
sailed
the
pacific
if
it
would
bring
me
freedom
from
this
cruel
devil
a
heavy
tread
on
the
matted
floor
of
the
inner
room
and
her
face
pales
to
the
hue
of
death
but
macy
is
somewhat
shy
of
his
two
wife
this
morning
and
she
hears
the
heavy
steps
recede
as
he
walks
over
to
his
a
flock
of
gogo
cast
their
shadow
over
the
lagoon
as
they
fly
westward
and
the
woman
eyes
follow
them
kill
him
yes
i
am
afraid
to
die
but
not
to
kill
and
i
am
a
stranger
here
and
if
i
ran
a
knife
into
his
fat
throat
these
natives
would
make
me
work
in
the
unless
one
wanted
me
for
himself
then
the
heavy
step
returns
and
she
slowly
faces
round
to
the
eyes
and
face
of
the
man
she
hates
and
raises
one
hand
to
her
lips
to
hide
a
blue
and
swollen
bruise
the
man
throws
his
short
figure
on
a
rough
native
sofa
and
passing
one
brawny
hand
meditatively
over
his
stubbly
chin
says
in
a
voice
like
the
snarl
of
a
hungry
wolf
here
i
say
sera
slew
round
i
want
to
talk
to
you
my
beauty
the
pale
set
face
flushed
and
paled
again
what
is
it
macy
ho
ho
is
it
well
just
this
do
be
a
fool
i
was
a
bit
put
about
last
night
else
i
would
have
been
so
quick
with
my
fist
cut
your
lip
i
see
well
you
must
forget
it
any
way
it
the
first
time
i
ever
touched
you
but
you
ought
to
know
by
now
that
i
am
not
a
man
to
be
trifled
with
no
man
let
alone
a
woman
is
going
to
set
a
course
for
macy
to
steer
by
and
to
come
to
the
point
at
once
i
want
you
to
understand
that
carl
ristow
daughter
is
coming
here
i
want
her
and
that
all
about
it
the
woman
laughed
scornfully
yes
i
know
that
was
why
she
pointed
to
her
lips
have
you
no
shame
i
know
you
have
no
pity
but
listen
i
swear
to
you
by
the
mother
of
christ
that
i
will
kill
her
kill
you
if
you
do
this
cruel
mouth
twitched
and
his
jaws
set
then
he
uttered
a
hoarse
laugh
by
god
has
it
taken
you
two
years
to
get
jealous
a
deadly
hate
gleamed
in
the
dark
passionate
eyes
jealous
mother
of
god
jealous
of
a
drunken
licentious
wretch
such
as
you
i
hate
you
hate
you
if
i
had
courage
enough
i
would
poison
myself
to
be
free
from
you
eyes
emitted
a
dull
sparkle
i
wish
you
would
damn
you
yet
you
are
game
enough
you
say
to
kill
me
and
malia
yes
but
not
for
love
of
you
but
because
of
the
white
blood
in
me
i
ca
i
wo
be
degraded
by
you
bringing
another
woman
here
dios
as
your
dad
used
to
say
before
the
devil
took
his
soul
we
see
about
that
my
beauty
i
suppose
because
your
father
was
a
d
d
dago
and
your
mother
a
tahiti
you
think
he
was
as
good
as
me
as
good
as
you
o
dog
of
an
english
convict
he
was
a
man
and
the
only
wrong
he
ever
did
was
to
let
me
become
wife
to
a
devil
like
you
the
cruel
eyes
were
close
to
hers
now
and
the
rough
brawny
hands
gripped
her
wrists
you
spiteful
portuguese
call
me
a
convict
again
and
i
twist
your
neck
like
a
fowl
you
i
have
made
things
easy
for
you
but
i
wo
now
do
you
hear
and
the
grip
tightened
ristow
girl
will
be
here
and
if
you
do
knuckle
down
to
her
it
be
a
case
of
for
you
you
can
go
and
get
a
husband
among
the
natives
and
he
flung
her
aside
and
went
to
the
god
that
ran
him
closest
for
his
soul
next
to
women
his
kept
his
word
for
two
days
later
malia
the
daughter
of
ristow
the
trader
at
ahunui
stepped
from
out
her
whaleboat
in
front
of
house
the
transaction
was
a
perfectly
legitimate
one
and
malia
did
not
allow
any
inconvenient
feeling
of
modesty
to
interfere
with
such
a
lucrative
arrangement
as
this
whereby
her
father
became
possessed
of
a
tun
of
oil
and
a
bag
of
chilian
dollars
and
she
of
much
finery
in
those
days
missionaries
had
not
made
much
and
gentlemen
like
messrs
ristow
and
took
all
the
wind
out
of
the
gospel
drum
and
so
malia
dressed
as
a
native
girl
with
painted
cheeks
and
bare
bosom
walked
demurely
up
from
the
boat
to
the
purchaser
of
her
beauty
who
with
arms
folded
across
his
broad
chest
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
path
that
led
from
the
beach
to
his
door
and
within
with
set
teeth
and
a
knife
in
the
bosom
of
her
blouse
bodice
sera
panted
with
the
lust
of
hate
and
revenge
the
bulky
form
of
darkened
the
sera
he
called
in
english
with
a
mocking
insulting
inflection
in
his
voice
come
here
and
welcome
my
new
wife
sera
came
walking
slowly
with
a
smile
on
her
lips
and
holding
out
her
left
hand
to
malia
said
in
the
native
language
welcome
why
said
with
mocking
jocularity
that
a
welcome
sera
aye
said
the
girl
with
the
white
man
blood
my
right
hand
is
for
this
and
the
knife
sank
home
into
malia
yellow
bosom
a
cold
bosom
for
you
macy
she
laughed
as
the
value
of
a
tun
of
oil
and
a
bag
of
chilian
dollars
gasped
out
its
life
upon
the
matted
floor
ii
the
native
drum
was
beating
as
the
boom
reverberated
through
the
village
the
natives
came
out
from
their
huts
and
gathered
around
the
house
of
the
old
men
where
with
bound
hands
and
feet
sera
the
white
man
wife
sat
with
her
back
to
one
of
the
and
opposite
her
sitting
like
a
native
on
a
mat
of
kapau
was
the
burly
figure
of
with
the
demon
of
disappointed
passion
eating
away
his
reason
and
a
mist
of
blood
swimming
before
his
eyes
the
people
all
detested
her
especially
the
women
in
that
one
thing
savages
resemble
christians
the
deadly
hatred
with
which
some
women
hate
those
of
their
sex
whom
they
know
to
be
better
and
more
pure
than
themselves
so
the
matter
was
decided
quickly
mesi
so
they
called
should
have
justice
if
he
thought
death
let
it
be
death
for
this
woman
who
had
let
out
the
blood
of
his
new
wife
only
one
man
loloku
the
boar
hunter
raised
his
voice
for
her
because
sera
had
cured
him
of
a
bad
wound
when
his
leg
had
been
torn
open
by
the
tusk
of
a
wild
boar
but
the
dull
glare
from
the
eyes
of
fell
on
him
and
he
said
no
more
then
at
a
sign
from
the
old
men
the
people
rose
from
the
mats
and
two
unbound
the
cords
of
afa
from
the
girl
and
led
her
out
into
the
square
and
looked
at
take
her
to
the
boat
he
said
ristow
boat
had
been
hauled
up
turned
over
and
covered
with
the
rough
mats
called
kapau
to
keep
off
the
heat
of
the
sun
with
staggering
feet
but
undaunted
heart
the
girl
sera
was
led
down
only
once
she
turned
her
head
and
looked
back
perhaps
loloku
would
try
again
then
as
they
came
to
the
boat
a
young
girl
at
a
sign
from
took
off
the
loose
blouse
and
they
placed
her
face
downwards
across
the
bilge
of
the
boat
and
two
pair
of
small
eager
brown
hands
each
seized
one
of
hers
and
dragged
the
white
rounded
arms
well
over
the
keel
of
the
boat
walked
round
to
that
side
drawing
through
his
hands
the
long
heavy
and
serrated
tail
of
the
fai
the
gigantic
of
oceana
he
would
have
liked
to
wield
it
himself
but
then
he
would
have
missed
part
of
his
revenge
he
could
not
have
seen
her
face
so
he
gave
it
to
a
native
and
watched
with
the
smile
of
a
fiend
the
white
back
turn
black
and
then
into
bloody
red
as
it
was
cut
to
pieces
with
the
tail
of
the
fai
the
sight
of
the
inanimate
thing
that
had
given
no
sign
of
its
agony
beyond
the
shudderings
and
twitchings
of
torn
and
mutilated
flesh
was
perhaps
disappointing
to
the
tiger
who
stood
and
watched
the
dark
stream
that
flowed
down
on
both
sides
of
the
boat
loloku
touched
his
arm
mesi
stay
thy
hand
she
is
dead
else
ah
said
that
would
be
a
pity
for
with
one
hand
shall
she
live
to
plant
taro
and
hatchet
in
hand
he
walked
in
between
the
two
brown
women
who
held
her
hands
they
moved
aside
and
let
go
then
swung
his
arm
the
blade
of
the
hatchet
struck
into
the
planking
and
the
right
hand
of
sera
fell
on
the
sand
a
man
put
his
arms
around
her
and
lifted
her
off
the
boat
he
placed
his
hand
on
the
bosom
and
looked
at
macy
e
mate
dead
he
said
the
rangers
of
the
tia
kau
between
nanomea
and
nanomaga
two
of
the
ellice
group
but
within
a
few
miles
of
the
latter
is
an
extensive
submerged
shoal
on
the
charts
called
the
grand
cocal
reef
but
by
the
people
of
the
two
islands
known
as
tia
kau
the
reef
on
the
shallowest
part
there
are
from
four
to
ten
fathoms
of
water
and
here
in
heavy
weather
the
sea
breaks
the
british
cruiser
basilisk
about
sought
for
the
reef
but
reported
it
as
yet
the
tia
kati
is
well
known
to
many
a
yankee
whaler
and
trading
schooner
and
is
a
favourite
of
the
people
of
nanomaga
when
the
sharks
give
them
a
chance
one
night
atupa
chief
of
nanomaga
caused
a
huge
fire
to
be
lit
on
the
beach
as
a
signal
to
the
people
of
nanomea
that
a
malaga
or
party
of
voyagers
was
coming
over
both
islands
are
low
not
more
than
fifteen
feet
above
and
are
distant
from
one
another
about
miles
the
following
night
the
reflection
of
the
answering
fire
on
nanomea
was
seen
and
atupa
prepared
to
send
away
his
people
in
seven
canoes
they
would
start
at
sundown
so
as
to
avoid
paddling
in
the
heat
the
nanomagans
have
no
sailing
canoes
and
be
guided
to
nanomea
which
they
expected
to
reach
early
in
the
morning
by
the
far
distant
glare
of
the
great
fires
of
coconut
and
pandanus
leaves
kindled
at
intervals
of
a
few
hours
about
seventy
people
were
to
go
and
all
that
day
the
little
village
busied
itself
in
preparing
for
the
nanomeans
gifts
of
foods
cooked
puraka
fowls
pigs
and
atupa
the
heathen
chief
was
troubled
in
his
mind
in
those
days
of
august
the
john
williams
had
touched
at
the
island
and
landed
a
samoan
missionary
who
had
pressed
him
to
accept
christianity
atupa
dreading
a
disturbing
element
in
his
little
community
had
at
first
declined
but
the
ship
had
come
again
and
the
chief
having
consented
to
try
the
new
religion
a
teacher
landed
but
since
then
he
and
his
had
consulted
the
oracle
and
had
been
told
that
the
shades
of
maumau
tahori
and
foilagi
their
deified
ancestors
had
answered
that
the
new
religion
was
unacceptable
to
them
and
that
the
samoan
teacher
must
be
killed
or
sent
away
and
for
this
was
atupa
sending
off
some
of
his
people
to
nanomea
with
gifts
of
goodwill
to
the
chiefs
to
beseech
them
to
consult
their
oracles
also
so
that
the
two
islands
might
take
concerted
action
against
this
new
foreign
god
whose
priests
said
that
all
men
were
equal
that
all
were
bad
and
he
and
his
son
alone
good
the
night
was
calm
when
the
seven
canoes
set
out
forty
men
and
thirty
women
and
children
were
in
the
party
and
the
craft
were
too
deeply
laden
for
any
but
the
smoothest
sea
on
the
ama
outrigger
of
each
canoe
were
the
baskets
of
food
and
bundles
of
mats
for
their
hosts
and
seated
on
these
were
the
children
while
the
women
sat
with
the
men
and
helped
them
to
paddle
two
hours
quick
paddling
brought
them
to
the
of
tia
kau
and
at
the
same
moment
they
saw
to
the
the
of
the
first
guiding
fire
it
was
then
that
the
people
in
the
first
canoe
wherein
was
palu
the
daughter
of
atupa
called
out
to
those
behind
to
prepare
their
asu
balers
as
a
heavy
squall
was
coming
down
from
the
eastward
then
laheu
an
old
warrior
in
another
canoe
cried
out
that
they
should
return
on
their
track
a
little
and
get
into
deep
water
for
said
he
if
we
swamp
away
from
tia
kau
it
is
but
a
little
thing
but
here
and
he
clasped
his
hands
rapidly
together
and
then
tore
them
apart
they
knew
what
he
meant
the
sharks
that
at
forsaking
the
deep
waters
patrolled
in
droves
of
thousands
the
shallow
waters
of
the
reef
to
devour
the
turtle
and
the
schools
of
tafau
uli
and
other
fish
in
quick
alarmed
silence
the
people
headed
back
but
even
then
the
first
fierce
squall
struck
them
and
some
of
the
frail
canoes
began
to
fill
at
once
i
matagi
i
matagi
head
to
the
wind
a
man
called
out
head
to
the
wind
or
we
perish
is
but
a
puff
and
it
is
gone
but
it
was
more
than
a
puff
the
seven
canoes
all
abreast
were
still
in
shallow
water
and
the
paddlers
kept
them
dead
in
the
teeth
of
the
whistling
wind
and
stinging
rain
and
called
out
words
of
encouragement
to
one
another
and
to
the
women
and
children
as
another
black
squall
burst
upon
them
and
the
curling
seas
began
to
break
the
canoe
in
which
was
atupa
daughter
was
the
largest
and
best
of
all
the
seven
but
was
much
overladen
and
on
the
outrigger
grating
were
four
children
these
the
chief
daughter
was
endeavouring
to
shield
from
the
rain
by
covering
them
with
a
mat
when
one
of
them
a
little
girl
endeavoured
to
steady
herself
by
holding
to
one
of
the
thin
pieces
of
grating
it
broke
and
her
arm
fell
through
and
struck
the
water
and
in
an
instant
she
gave
a
dull
smothered
wail
palu
the
woman
seized
her
by
her
hair
and
pulled
the
child
up
to
a
sitting
posture
and
then
shrieked
with
terror
the
girl
arm
was
gone
and
then
in
the
blackness
of
night
lightened
now
by
the
white
seething
boiling
surge
the
people
saw
in
the
phosphorescent
water
countless
hundreds
of
the
savage
terrors
of
the
tia
kau
darting
hither
and
thither
amongst
the
canoes
for
the
smell
of
blood
had
brought
them
together
instantly
presently
a
great
grey
monster
tore
the
paddle
from
out
the
hands
of
the
steersman
of
the
canoe
wherein
were
the
terrified
palu
and
the
four
children
and
then
before
the
man
could
bring
her
head
to
the
wind
she
broached
to
and
filled
like
ravening
wolves
the
sharks
dashed
upon
their
prey
and
ere
the
people
had
time
to
give
more
than
a
despairing
cry
those
hideous
jaws
and
gleaming
cruel
teeth
had
sealed
their
fate
maddened
with
fear
the
rest
of
the
people
threw
everything
out
of
the
six
other
canoes
to
lighten
them
and
as
the
bundles
of
mats
and
baskets
of
food
touched
the
water
the
sharks
seized
and
bit
tore
and
swallowed
then
one
by
one
every
paddle
was
grabbed
from
the
hands
of
the
paddlers
and
the
canoes
broached
to
and
filled
in
that
sea
of
death
all
save
one
which
was
carried
by
the
force
of
the
wind
away
from
the
rest
in
this
were
the
only
survivors
two
men
the
agony
could
not
have
lasted
long
were
i
to
live
as
long
as
he
whom
the
faifeau
missionary
tells
us
lived
to
be
nine
hundred
and
sixty
and
nine
i
shall
hear
the
groans
and
cries
and
shrieks
of
that
po
malaia
that
night
of
evil
luck
said
one
of
the
two
who
lived
to
denison
the
white
trader
at
nanomea
once
did
i
have
my
paddle
fast
in
the
mouth
of
a
little
devil
and
it
drew
me
backwards
backwards
over
the
stern
till
my
head
touched
the
water
tah
but
i
was
strong
with
fear
and
held
on
for
to
lose
it
meant
death
by
the
teeth
and
tulua
he
who
came
out
alive
with
me
seized
my
feet
and
held
on
else
had
i
gone
but
look
thou
at
this
and
he
pointed
to
his
scarred
neck
and
back
and
shoulders
ere
i
could
free
my
foe
paddle
and
raise
my
head
i
was
bitten
thus
by
others
ah
papalagi
some
men
are
born
to
wisdom
but
most
are
fools
had
not
atupa
been
filled
with
vain
fears
he
had
killed
the
man
who
caused
him
to
lose
so
many
of
our
people
so
said
the
white
man
and
wouldst
thou
have
killed
the
man
who
brought
thee
the
new
faith
fie
aye
that
would
i
in
those
days
when
i
was
po
uli
uli
heathen
lit
in
the
blackest
night
but
not
now
for
i
am
christian
yet
had
atupa
killed
and
buried
the
stranger
we
could
have
lied
and
said
he
died
of
a
sickness
when
they
of
his
people
came
to
seek
him
and
then
had
i
now
my
son
tagipo
with
me
he
who
went
into
the
bellies
of
the
sharks
at
tia
kau
pallou
taloi
a
memory
of
the
paumotus
i
stayed
once
at
rotoava
in
the
low
archipelago
eastern
polynesia
while
suffering
from
injuries
received
in
a
boat
accident
one
wild
night
my
host
the
rotoava
trader
was
a
sociable
old
pirate
whose
convivial
soul
would
never
let
him
drink
alone
he
was
by
trade
a
having
had
in
his
early
days
a
shed
at
miller
point
in
sydney
where
he
made
money
and
married
a
wife
but
this
latter
event
was
poor
tom
oscott
undoing
and
in
the
end
he
took
his
chest
of
tools
on
board
the
thyra
trading
brig
and
sailed
away
to
polynesia
finally
after
many
years
wandering
he
settled
down
at
rotoava
as
a
trader
and
and
became
a
noted
drinker
of
bottled
beer
the
only
method
by
which
i
could
avoid
his
incessant
invitations
to
have
another
was
to
get
his
wife
and
children
to
carry
me
down
to
his
built
in
a
lovely
spot
surrounded
by
giant
puka
trees
here
under
the
shade
i
had
my
mats
spread
and
with
one
of
his
children
sitting
at
my
head
to
fan
away
the
flies
i
lay
and
watched
through
the
belt
of
coconuts
that
lined
the
beach
the
blue
rollers
breaking
on
the
reef
and
the
floating
high
overhead
tom
was
in
the
bush
one
morning
when
his
family
carried
me
to
the
he
had
gone
for
a
log
of
seasoned
toa
wood
a
hard
wood
much
used
in
boat
building
to
another
village
at
noon
he
returned
and
i
heard
him
bawling
for
me
his
little
daughter
the
gave
an
answering
yell
and
then
tom
walked
down
the
path
carrying
two
bottles
of
beer
behind
him
lucia
his
eldest
daughter
a
monstrous
creature
of
giggles
adipose
tissue
and
warm
heart
with
glasses
and
a
plate
of
crackers
lastly
old
marie
the
wife
with
a
little
table
by
you
a
lot
more
me
it
better
lyin
here
in
the
cool
than
foolin
around
in
the
sun
so
i
brought
yer
suthin
to
drink
oh
tom
i
groaned
i
sure
that
beer
bad
for
me
the
maker
of
boats
sat
on
his
bench
and
said
that
he
knew
of
a
brewer
carter
in
sydney
who
at
merriman
pub
on
miller
point
had
had
a
cask
of
beer
roll
over
him
smashed
seven
ribs
one
arm
and
one
thigh
doctors
gave
him
up
undertaker
man
called
on
his
wife
for
coffin
order
but
a
sailor
chap
said
he
pull
him
through
got
an
indiarubber
tube
and
made
him
suck
up
as
much
beer
as
he
could
hold
kept
it
up
till
all
his
bones
setted
again
and
he
recovered
why
should
i
if
i
only
drank
enough
hurry
up
old
this
to
the
faded
marie
uttering
merely
the
word
hog
she
drew
the
cork
i
had
to
drink
some
and
every
hour
or
so
tom
would
say
it
was
very
hot
and
open
yet
another
bottle
at
last
i
escaped
the
beer
by
nearly
dying
and
then
the
kind
old
fellow
hurried
away
in
his
boat
to
apatiki
another
island
of
the
group
and
came
back
with
some
bottles
of
claret
bought
from
the
french
trader
there
with
him
came
two
visitors
a
big
of
middle
age
and
his
wife
a
girl
of
twenty
or
this
was
edward
pallou
and
his
wife
taloi
i
was
in
the
house
when
tom
returned
enjoying
a
smoke
pallou
and
his
wife
entered
and
greeted
me
the
man
was
a
fine
fellow
wiry
and
muscular
with
eyes
and
bearing
across
his
right
cheek
a
heavy
scar
his
wife
was
a
sweet
dainty
little
creature
with
red
lips
dazzling
teeth
hazel
eyes
and
long
wavy
hair
the
first
thing
i
noticed
about
her
was
that
instead
of
squatting
on
a
mat
in
native
fashion
she
sank
into
a
wide
chair
and
lying
back
enquired
with
a
pleasant
smile
and
in
perfect
english
whether
i
was
feeling
any
better
she
was
very
fair
even
for
a
paumotuan
as
i
thought
she
must
be
and
i
said
to
pallou
why
any
one
would
take
your
wife
to
be
an
englishwoman
not
i
said
taloi
with
a
rippling
laugh
as
she
commenced
to
make
a
cigarette
i
am
a
south
sea
islander
i
belong
to
apatiki
and
was
born
there
perhaps
i
have
white
blood
in
me
who
knows
only
my
wise
mother
but
when
i
was
twelve
years
old
i
was
adopted
by
a
gentleman
in
papeite
and
he
sent
me
to
sydney

so
were
the
misses
f
to
see

they
said
i
was
downright
wicked
because
one
day
i
tore
the
dress
off
a
girl
who
said
my
skin
was
tallowy
like
my
name
when
i
came
back
to
tahiti
my
guardian
took
me
to
raiatea
where
he
had
a
business
and
said
i
must
marry
him
the
beast
oh

the
pallou
who
sat
beside
me

about
your
doings

up
yourself

brute

savage

a
poor
devil
of
a
woman
talk
a
little
look
here
tom
do
you
see
that
flash
jacket
he
wearing
well
i
sat
up
two
nights
making
that
for
him
to
come
over
here
with
and
show

before
the
rotoava
girls
go
and
die
you
the
big
looked
at
tom
and
then
at
me
his
lips
twitched
with
suppressed
passion
and
a
dangerous
gleam
shone
a
moment
in
his
dark
eyes
here
i
say
taloi
broke
in
tom
just
go
easy
a
bit
with
ted
as
for
him

of
the
girls

and
so
do
you
taloi
laugh
clear
as
the
note
of
a
bird
answered
him
and
then
she
said
she
was
sorry
and
the
lines
around
pallou
rigid
mouth
softened
down
it
was
easy
to
see
that
this
grim
loved
for
all
her
bitter
tongue
the
bright
creature
who
sat
in
the
big
chair
presently
taloi
and
lucia
went
out
to
bathe
and
pallou
remained
with
me
tom
joined
us
and
for
a
while
no
one
spoke
then
the
trader
laying
down
his
pipe
on
the
table
drew
his
seat
closer
and
commenced
in
low
tones
a
conversation
in
tahitian
with
pallou
from
the
earnest
manner
of
old
tom
and
the
sullen
gloom
that
overspread
pallou
face
i
could
discern
that
some
anxiety
possessed
them
at
last
tom
addressed
me
look
here
ted
here

in
a
mess
and
we

of
it

and
he
says

his
dark
eyes
on
me
and
looked
intently
into
mine

and
tries
to
tear
her
away
stop
that
says
pallou
girl
ai
willin
an
he
pushes
frenchy
away
again
and
frenchy
whips
out

and
nearly

face

and
then
afore
he

the
two
native

runned
away
ashore
and
pallou
and
taloi
takes

and
pulls

until

then
a

and
they

away
and
gets

the
group
and
brings
up

o
the
run
of
that
there
gunboat

captain
and
pallou
put
out
his
brawny
hand
the
hand
that
drove
it
home
into
frenchy
throat
and
grasped
mine
in
silence
then
he
lifted
his

and
showed

i
said
if
you
have
told
me
the
whole
story
i
would
help
any
man
in
such
a
fix
as
you
and
then
taloi
fresh
from
her
bath
came
in
and
sat
down
on
the
mat
whilst
fat
lucia
combed
and
dressed
her
glossy
hair
and
placed
therein
scarlet
hisbiscus
flowers
and
to
show
her
returned
good
temper
she
took
from
her
lips
the
cigarette
she
was
smoking
and
offered
it
to
the
grim
pallou
a
month
later
we
all
three
left
rotoava
and
pallou
and
taloi
went
ashore
at
one
of
the
hervey
group
where
i
gave
him
charge
of
a
station
with
a
small
stock
of
trade
and
we
sailed
away
to
pitcairn
and
easter
islands
pallou
did
a
good
business
and
was
well
liked
and
some
seven
months
afterwards
when
we
were
at
maga
reva
in
the
gambier
group
i
got
a
letter
from
him
business
goes
well
he
wrote
but
taloi
is
ill
i
think
she
will
die
you
will
find
everything
square
though
when
you
come
but
i
was
never
to
see
that
particular
island
again
as
the
firm
sent
another
vessel
in
place
of
ours
to
get
pallou
produce
when
the
captain
and
the
supercargo
went
ashore
a
white
trader
met
them
with
a
roll
of
papers
in
his
hand
pallou
he
said
why
where
is
he
gone
away
no
he
here
still
planted
alongside
his
missus
dead
yes
a
few
months
after
he
arrived
here
that
pretty
little
wife
of
his
died
he
came
to
me
and
asked
if
i
would
come
and
take
stock
with
him
i
said
he
seemed
in
a
bit
of
a
hurry
to
start
stocktaking
before
the
poor
thing
was
buried
but
anyhow
i
went
and
we
took
stock
and
he
counted
his
cash
and
asked
me
to
lock
the
place
up
if
anything
happened
to
him
then
we
had
a
drink
and
he
bade
me
and
said
he
was
going
to
sit
with
taloi
awhile
before
they
took
her
away
he
sent
the
native
women
out
of
the
bedroom
and
the
next
minute
i
heard
a
shot
he
done
it
right
enough
right
through
his
brain
poor
chap
i
can
tell
you
he
thought
a
lot
of
that
girl
of
his
there
the
two
graves
over
there
by
that
fetau
tree
here
his
and
bag
of
cash
and
keys
would
you
mind
giving
me
that
pair
of
rubber
he
left
a
basket
of
it
was
in
steinberger
time
colonel
steinberger
who
in
succeeded
in
forming
a
government
in
samoa
a
trader
had
come
up
to
apia
in
his
boat
from
the
end
of
savaii
the
largest
of
the
samoan
group
and
was
on
his
way
home
again
when
the
falling
tide
caused
him
to
stop
awhile
at
point
about
two
miles
from
apia
here
he
designed
to
smoke
and
talk
and
drink
kava
at
the
great
camp
with
some
hospitable
native
acquaintances
during
the
rising
of
the
water
soon
he
was
taking
his
ease
on
a
soft
mat
watching
the
bevy
of
aua
luma
the
local
girls
making
a
bowl
of
kava
now
this
trader
lived
at
falealupo
at
the
extreme
westerly
end
of
savaii
but
the
samoans
by
reason
of
its
isolation
and
extremity
have
for
ages
called
it
by
another
name
an
unprintable
one
and
so
some
of
the
people
present
began
to
jest
with
the
trader
for
living
in
such
a
place
he
fell
in
with
their
humour
and
said
that
if
those
present
would
find
for
him
a
wife
a
girl
unseared
by
the
breath
of
scandal
he
would
leave
falealupo
for
safune
where
he
had
bought
land
malie
said
an
old
dame
with
one
eye
and
white
hair
the
papalagi
foreigner
is
inspired
to
speak
wisdom
for
at
safune
grow
the
sweetest
nuts
and
the
biggest
taro
and
and
lo
here
among
the
is
a
young
maid
from
safune
mine
own
salome
and
against
her
name
can
no
one
in
samoa
laugh
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
and
the
old
creature
amid
laughter
and
cries
of
isa
e
le
ma
le
lo
matua
the
old
woman
is
without
shame
crept
over
to
the
trader
and
with
one
skinny
hand
on
his
knee
gazed
steadily
into
his
face
with
her
one
eye
the
trader
looked
at
the
girl
at
salome
she
had
at
her
speech
turned
her
head
aside
and
taking
the
chaw
of
from
her
pretty
mouth
dissolved
into
tears
the
trader
was
a
man
of
quick
perceptions
and
he
made
up
his
mind
to
do
in
earnest
what
he
had
said
in
jest
this
because
of
the
tears
of
salome
he
quickly
whispered
to
the
old
woman
come
to
the
boat
before
the
full
of
the
tide
and
we
will
talk
when
the
kava
was
ready
for
drinking
the
others
present
had
forgotten
all
about
the
old
woman
and
salome
who
had
both
crept
away
unobserved
and
an
hour
or
two
was
passed
in
merriment
for
the
trader
was
a
man
well
liked
then
when
he
rose
and
said
to
fa
they
begged
him
not
to
attempt
to
pass
down
in
his
boat
inside
the
reef
as
he
was
sure
to
be
fired
upon
for
how
were
their
people
to
tell
a
friend
from
an
enemy
in
the
black
night
but
the
white
man
smiled
and
said
his
boat
was
too
heavily
laden
to
face
the
ocean
swell
so
they
bade
him
to
fa
and
called
out
manuia
oe
bless
you
as
he
lifted
the
door
of
thatch
and
went
the
old
woman
awaited
him
holding
the
girl
by
the
hand
on
the
ground
lay
a
basket
strongly
tied
up
salome
still
wept
but
the
old
woman
angrily
bade
her
cease
and
enter
the
boat
which
the
crew
had
now
pushed
to
the
beach
the
old
woman
lifted
the
basket
and
carefully
put
it
on
board
be
sure
she
said
to
the
crew
not
to
sit
on
it
for
it
is
very
ripe
that
i
am
taking
to
my
people
in
manono
give
them
here
to
me
said
the
trader
and
he
put
the
basket
in
the
stern
out
of
the
way
the
old
woman
came
aft
too
and
crouched
at
his
feet
and
smoked
a
sului
a
cigarette
rolled
in
dried
banana
leaf
the
cool
freshened
as
the
sail
was
hoisted
and
then
the
crew
besought
the
trader
not
to
run
down
inside
the
reef
bullets
they
said
if
fired
in
plenty
always
hit
something
and
the
sea
was
fairly
smooth
outside
the
reef
and
old
lupetea
grasped
his
hand
and
muttered
in
his
ear
for
the
sake
of
this
my
little
daughter
go
outside
see
now
i
am
old
and
to
lie
when
so
near
death
as
i
am
is
foolish
be
warned
by
me
and
be
wise
sail
out
into
the
ocean
and
at
daylight
we
shall
be
at
salua
in
manono
then
thou
canst
set
my
feet
on
the
shore
i
and
the
basket
but
the
girl
shall
go
with
thee
thou
canst
marry
her
if
that
be
to
thy
mind
in
the
fashion
of
the
papalagi
or
take
her
samoa
samoan
fashion
thus
will
i
keep
faith
with
thee
if
the
girl
be
false
her
neck
is
but
little
and
thy
fingers
strong
now
the
trader
thought
in
this
wise
this
is
well
for
me
for
if
i
get
the
girl
away
thus
quietly
from
all
her
relations
i
shall
save
much
in
presents
and
his
heart
rejoiced
for
although
not
mean
he
was
a
careful
man
so
he
steered
his
boat
seaward
between
the
seething
surf
that
boiled
and
hissed
on
both
sides
of
the
boat
passage
as
the
boat
sailed
past
the
misty
line
of
upolu
the
trader
lifted
the
girl
up
beside
him
and
spoke
to
her
she
was
not
afraid
of
him
she
said
for
many
had
told
her
he
was
a
good
man
and
not
an
ula
vale
scamp
but
she
wept
because
now
save
her
old
grandmother
all
her
kinsfolk
were
dead
even
but
a
day
and
a
half
ago
her
one
brother
was
killed
with
her
cousin
they
were
strong
men
but
the
bullets
were
swift
and
so
they
died
and
their
heads
had
been
shown
at
matautu
for
that
she
had
grieved
and
wept
and
eaten
nothing
and
the
world
was
cold
and
dark
to
her
poor
little
devil
said
the
trader
to
himself
hungry
then
he
opened
a
locker
and
found
a
tin
of
sardines
not
a
scrap
of
biscuit
there
was
plenty
of
biscuit
though
in
the
boat
in
tins
but
on
these
mats
were
spread
his
crew
were
sleeping
he
was
about
to
rouse
them
when
he
remembered
the
old
dame
basket
of
ripe
he
laughed
and
looked
at
her
she
too
slept
coiled
up
at
his
feet
but
first
he
opened
the
sardines
and
placed
them
beside
the
girl
and
motioned
her
to
steer
her
eyes
gleamed
like
diamonds
in
the
darkness
as
she
answered
his
glance
and
her
soft
fingers
grasped
the
tiller
very
quickly
then
he
felt
among
the
packages
aft
till
he
came
to
the
basket
a
quick
stroke
of
his
knife
cut
the
cinnet
that
lashed
the
sides
together
he
felt
inside
only
two
after
all
but
big
ones
and
no
mistake
wrapped
in
cloth
too
i
wonder
hell
and
furies
this
as
his
fingers
came
in
contact
with
something
that
felt
like
a
human
eye
drawing
his
hand
quickly
back
he
fumbled
in
his
pockets
for
a
match
and
struck
it
no
two
heads
with
closed
eyes
and
livid
lips
blue
with
the
pallor
of
death
showing
their
white
teeth
and
salome
covered
her
face
and
slid
down
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
again
and
wept
afresh
for
her
cousin
and
brother
and
the
boat
came
up
in
the
wind
but
no
one
awoke
the
trader
was
angry
but
after
he
had
tied
up
the
basket
again
he
put
the
boat
on
her
course
once
more
and
called
to
the
girl
she
crept
close
to
him
and
nestled
under
his
overcoat
for
the
morning
air
came
across
the
sea
from
the
forests
and
she
was
chilled
then
she
told
the
story
of
how
her
granddam
had
begged
the
heads
from
those
of
malietoa
troops
who
had
taken
them
at
matautu
and
then
gone
to
the
camp
at
in
the
hope
of
getting
a
passage
in
some
boat
to
manono
her
country
where
she
would
fain
bury
them
and
that
night
he
had
come
and
old
lupetea
had
rejoiced
and
sworn
her
to
secrecy
about
the
heads
in
the
basket
and
that
also
was
why
lupetea
was
afraid
of
the
boat
going
down
inside
the
passage
for
there
were
many
enemies
to
be
met
with
and
they
would
have
shot
old
lupetea
because
she
was
of
manono
that
was
all
then
she
ate
the
sardines
and
leaning
her
head
against
the
trader
bosom
fell
asleep
as
the
first
note
of
the
great
grey
pigeon
sounded
the
dawn
the
trader
boat
sailed
softly
up
to
the
salua
beach
and
old
lupetea
rose
and
bidding
the
crew
and
calling
down
blessings
on
the
head
of
the
good
and
clever
white
man
as
she
rubbed
his
and
the
noses
against
her
own
she
grasped
her
basket
of
and
went
ashore
then
the
trader
with
salome
nestling
to
his
side
sailed
out
again
into
the
ocean
towards
his
home
enderby
courtship
the
two
ghastly
creatures
sat
facing
each
other
in
their
wordless
misery
as
the
wind
died
away
and
the
tattered
remnants
of
the
sail
hung
motionless
after
a
last
faint
flutter
the
thing
that
sat
aft
for
surely
so
grotesquely
horrible
a
vision
could
not
be
a
man
pointed
with
hands
like
the
talons
of
a
bird
of
prey
to
the
purple
outline
of
the
island
in
the
west
and
his
black
lips
moved
opened
and
essayed
to
speak
the
other
being
that
with
bare
and
skinny
arms
clasped
around
its
bony
knees
sat
crouched
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
leaned
forward
to
listen
ducie
island
enderby
said
the
first
in
a
hoarse
rattling
whisper
no
one
on
it
but
water
is
there
and
plenty
of
birds
and
turtle
and
a
few
coconuts
at
the
word
water
the
listener
gave
a
curious
gibbering
chuckle
unclasped
his
hands
from
his
knees
and
crept
further
towards
the
speaker
and
the
current
is
setting
us
down
to
it
wind
or
no
wind
i
believe
we
see
this
through
after
all
and
the
black
lips
parted
in
a
hideous
grimace
the
man
whom
he
called
enderby
sank
his
head
again
upon
his
knees
and
his
dulled
and
bloodshot
eyes
rested
on
something
that
lay
at
the
captain
feet
the
figure
of
a
woman
enveloped
from
her
shoulders
down
in
a
ragged
native
mat
for
some
hours
past
she
had
lain
thus
with
the
grey
shadows
of
coming
dissolution
hovering
about
her
pallid
face
and
only
the
faintest
movement
of
lips
and
eyelids
to
show
that
she
still
lived
the
man
who
steered
looked
down
for
a
second
upon
the
face
beneath
him
with
the
unconcern
for
others
born
of
the
agony
of
thirst
and
despair
and
again
his
gaunt
face
turned
to
the
land
yet
she
was
his
wife
and
not
six
weeks
back
he
had
experienced
a
cold
sort
of
satisfaction
in
the
possession
of
so
much
beauty
he
remembered
that
day
now
enderby
the
passenger
from
sydney
and
he
were
walking
the
poop
his
wife
was
asleep
in
a
on
the
other
side
an
open
book
lay
in
her
lap
as
the
two
men
passed
and
her
the
one
noted
that
the
other
would
glance
in
undisguised
and
honest
admiration
at
the
figure
in
the
chair
and
enderby
who
was
as
open
as
the
day
had
said
to
him
langton
that
the
sleeping
mrs
langton
made
as
beautiful
a
picture
as
he
had
ever
seen
the
sail
stirred
filled
out
and
then
drooped
again
and
the
two
spectres
with
the
sleeping
woman
between
still
sat
with
their
hungry
eyes
gazing
over
toward
the
land
as
the
sun
sank
the
outlines
of
the
summits
and
beetling
cliffs
stood
forth
clearly
for
a
short
minute
or
two
as
if
to
mock
them
with
hope
and
then
became
enshrouded
in
the
tenebrous
night
another
hour
and
a
faint
sigh
came
from
the
ragged
mat
enderby
for
ever
on
the
watch
had
first
seen
a
white
hand
silhouetted
against
the
blackness
of
the
covering
and
knew
that
she
was
still
alive
and
as
he
was
about
to
call
langton
who
lay
in
the
muttering
in
hideous
dreams
he
heard
the
woman
voice
calling
him
with
panting
breath
and
trembling
limbs
he
crawled
over
beside
her
and
gently
touched
her
hand
thank
god
you
are
alive
mrs
langton
shall
i
wake
captain
langton
we
must
be
nearing
the
land
no
do
let
him
sleep
but
i
called
you
mr
enderby
to
lift
me
up
i
want
to
see
where
the
rain
is
coming
from
enderby
groaned
in
anguish
of
spirit
rain
god
has
forgotten
us
i
and
then
he
stopped
in
shame
at
betraying
his
weakness
before
a
woman
the
soft
tender
tones
again
ah
do
help
me
up
please
i
can
feel
the
rain
is
near
then
the
man
with
hot
tears
of
mingled
weakness
and
pity
coursing
down
his
cheeks
raised
her
up
why
there
it
is
mr
enderby
and
the
land
as
well
and
it
a
heavy
squall
too
and
she
pointed
to
a
moving
inky
mass
that
half
concealed
the
black
shadow
of
the
island
quick
take
my
mat
one
end
of
it
is
tight
and
will
hold
water
langton
here
a
rain
squall
coming
and
enderby
pressed
the
woman
hand
to
his
lips
and
kissed
it
again
and
again
then
with
eager
hands
he
took
the
mat
from
her
and
staggering
forward
to
the
bows
stretched
the
sound
end
across
and
bellied
it
down
and
then
the
moving
mass
that
was
once
black
and
was
now
white
swept
down
upon
them
and
brought
them
life
and
joy
langton
with
an
empty
in
his
hand
stumbled
over
his
figure
plunged
the
vessel
into
the
water
and
drank
again
and
again
curse
you
you
brute
shouted
enderby
through
the
wild
noise
of
the
hissing
rain
where
is
your
wife
are
you
going
to
let
her
lie
there
without
a
drink
langton
answered
not
but
drank
once
more
then
enderby
with
an
oath
tore
the
tin
from
his
hand
filled
it
and
took
it
to
her
holding
her
up
while
she
drank
and
as
her
eyes
looked
gratefully
into
his
while
he
placed
her
tenderly
back
in
the
the
madness
of
a
moment
overpowered
him
and
he
kissed
her
on
the
lips
concerned
only
with
the
nectar
in
the
mat
langton
took
no
regard
of
enderby
as
he
opened
the
little
locker
pulled
out
a
coarse
dungaree
jumper
and
wrapped
it
round
the
and
drenched
figure
of
the
woman
she
was
weeping
now
partly
from
the
joy
of
knowing
that
she
was
not
to
die
of
the
agonies
of
thirst
in
an
open
boat
in
and
partly
because
the
water
had
given
her
strength
to
remember
that
langton
had
cursed
her
when
he
had
stumbled
over
her
to
get
at
the
water
in
the
mat
she
had
married
him
because
of
his
handsome
face
and
dashing
manner
for
one
reason
and
because
her
pious
scotch
father
also
a
trading
captain
had
pointed
out
to
her
that
langton
had
made
and
was
still
making
money
in
the
island
trade
her
ideal
of
a
happy
life
was
to
have
her
husband
leave
the
sea
and
buy
an
estate
either
in
tahiti
or
chili
she
knew
both
countries
well
the
first
was
her
birthplace
and
between
there
and
valparaiso
and
sydney
her
old
father
had
traded
for
years
always
carrying
with
him
his
one
daughter
whose
beauty
the
old
man
regarded
as
a
vara
vain
thing
but
likely
to
procure
him
a
mon
for
a
mrs
langton
cared
for
her
husband
in
a
prosaic
sort
of
way
but
she
knew
no
more
of
his
inner
nature
and
latent
utter
selfishness
a
year
after
her
marriage
than
she
had
known
a
year
before
yet
because
of
the
strain
of
dark
blood
in
her
veins
her
mother
was
a
tahitian
she
felt
the
mastery
of
his
savage
resolution
in
the
face
of
danger
in
the
thirteen
days
of
horror
that
had
elapsed
since
the
brigantine
crashed
on
an
uncharted
reef
between
pitcairn
and
ducie
islands
and
the
other
boat
had
parted
company
with
them
taking
most
of
the
provisions
and
water
and
to
hard
callous
natures
such
as
langton
women
yield
easily
and
admire
which
is
better
perhaps
than
loving
for
both
but
that
savage
curse
still
sounded
in
her
ears
and
unconsciously
made
her
think
of
enderby
who
had
always
ever
since
the
eighth
day
in
the
boat
given
her
half
his
share
of
water
little
did
she
know
the
agony
it
cost
him
the
day
before
when
the
water
had
given
out
to
bring
her
the
whole
of
his
allowance
and
as
she
drank
the
man
heart
had
beaten
with
a
dull
sense
of
pity
the
while
his
baser
nature
called
out
fool
it
is
his
place
not
yours
to
suffer
for
her
at
daylight
the
boat
was
close
in
to
the
land
and
langton
in
his
cool
cynical
fashion
told
his
wife
and
enderby
to
finish
up
the
last
of
the
meat
and
biscuit
for
if
they
capsized
getting
through
into
the
lagoon
he
said
they
would
never
want
any
more
he
had
eaten
all
he
wanted
unknown
to
the
others
and
looked
with
an
unmoved
face
at
enderby
soaking
some
biscuit
in
the
tin
for
his
wife
then
with
the
ragged
sail
fluttering
to
the
wind
langton
headed
the
boat
through
the
passage
into
the
glassy
waters
of
the
lagoon
and
the
two
tottering
men
leading
the
woman
between
them
sought
the
shelter
of
a
thicket
scrub
impenetrable
to
the
rays
of
the
sun
and
slept
and
then
for
a
week
enderby
went
and
scoured
the
reefs
for
food
for
her
one
day
at
noon
enderby
awoke
the
woman
still
slept
heavily
the
first
sign
of
returning
strength
showing
as
a
faint
tinge
in
the
pallor
of
her
cheek
langton
was
gone
a
sudden
chill
passed
over
him
had
langton
taken
the
boat
and
left
them
to
die
on
lonely
ducie
with
hasty
step
enderby
hurried
to
the
beach
the
boat
was
there
safe
and
at
the
farther
end
of
the
beach
he
saw
langton
sitting
on
the
sand
eating
selfish
brute
muttered
enderby
i
wonder
what
he
got
just
then
he
saw
close
overhead
a
huge
ripe
pandanus
and
picking
up
a
heavy
flat
piece
of
coral
he
tried
to
ascend
the
triplicated
bole
of
the
tree
and
hammer
off
some
of
the
fruit
langton
looked
up
at
him
and
showed
his
white
teeth
in
a
mocking
smile
at
the
futile
effort
enderby
walked
over
to
him
stone
in
hand
he
was
not
a
vindictive
man
but
he
had
grown
to
hate
langton
fiercely
during
the
past
week
for
his
selfish
neglect
of
his
wife
and
here
was
the
fellow
gorging
himself
on
and
his
tender
delicate
wife
living
on
and
pandanus
langton
he
said
speaking
thickly
and
pretending
not
to
notice
the
remainder
of
the
eggs
the
tide
is
out
and
we
may
get
a
turtle
in
one
of
the
pools
if
you
come
with
me
mrs
langton
needs
something
better
than
that
infernal
pandanus
fruit
her
lips
are
quite
sore
and
bleeding
from
eating
it
the
inner
nature
came
out
are
they
my
wife
lips
seem
to
give
you
a
very
great
deal
of
concern
she
has
not
said
anything
to
me
and
i
have
an
idea
the
look
in
enderby
face
shamed
into
silence
the
slander
he
was
about
to
utter
then
he
added
coolly
but
as
for
going
with
you
after
a
turtle
thanks
i
wo
i
found
a
nest
here
and
have
had
a
good
square
feed
if
the
cursed
hawks
and
boobies
been
here
before
me
i
have
got
the
whole
lot
then
he
tore
the
skin
off
another
egg
with
his
teeth
with
a
curious
guttural
voice
enderby
asked
how
many
eggs
were
left
thirty
or
so
perhaps
forty
and
you
have
eaten
all
but
those
pointing
with
savage
contempt
to
five
of
the
round
white
balls
give
me
those
for
your
wife
my
dear
man
louise
has
too
much
island
blood
in
her
not
to
be
able
to
do
better
than
i
or
you
in
a
case
like
ours
and
as
you
have
kindly
constituted
yourself
her
providore
you
had
better
go
and
look
for
a
nest
yourself
you
dog
and
the
coral
stone
crashed
into
his
brain
when
enderby
returned
he
found
mrs
langton
sitting
up
on
the
mound
that
the
beach
where
he
had
left
langton
come
away
from
here
he
said
into
the
shade
i
have
found
a
few
they
walked
back
a
little
and
sat
down
but
for
the
wild
riot
in
his
brain
enderby
would
have
noted
that
every
vestige
of
colour
had
left
her
face
you
must
be
hungry
he
thought
he
was
saying
to
her
and
he
placed
the
white
objects
in
her
lap
she
turned
them
slowly
over
and
over
in
her
hands
and
then
dropped
them
with
a
shudder
some
were
flecked
with
red
for
god
sake
the
man
cried
tell
me
what
you
know
i
saw
it
all
she
answered
i
swear
to
you
mrs
lan
the
name
stuck
in
his
throat
i
never
meant
it
as
god
is
my
witness
i
swear
it
if
we
ever
escape
from
here
i
will
give
myself
up
to
justice
as
a
murderer
the
woman
with
hands
spread
over
her
face
shook
her
head
from
side
to
side
and
sobbed
then
she
spoke
i
thought
i
loved
him
once
yet
it
was
for
me
and
you
saved
my
life
over
and
over
again
in
the
boat
all
sinners
are
forgiven
we
are
told
why
should
not
you
be
and
it
was
for
me
you
did
it
and
i
wo
let
you
give
yourself
up
to
justice
or
any
one
i
say
he
died
in
the
boat
and
then
the
laughter
of
hysterics
when
some
months
later
the
josephine
whaler
of
new
london
picked
them
up
on
her
way
to
japan
via
the
carolines
and
pelews
the
captain
satisfactorily
answered
the
query
made
by
enderby
if
he
could
marry
them
he
rayther
thought
he
could
a
man
who
was
used
ter
ketchin
and
the
powerfullest
creature
of
almighty
gawd
creation
was
ekal
to
marryin
a
pair
of
unfortunit
human
beans
in
sich
a
situation
as
theirs
and
by
the
irony
of
fate
the
enderbys
that
is
their
name
are
now
living
in
a
group
of
islands
where
there
quite
a
trade
done
in
turtle
and
whenever
a
ship
captain
comes
to
dine
with
them
they
never
have
the
local
dish
turtle
eggs
for
dinner
we
see
them
so
often
enderby
explains
and
my
wife
is
quite
tired
of
them
long
charley
good
little
wife
there
was
the
island
only
ten
miles
away
and
there
it
had
been
for
a
whole
week
sometimes
we
had
got
near
enough
to
see
long
house
and
the
figures
of
natives
walking
on
the
yellow
beach
and
then
the
westerly
current
would
set
us
away
to
leeward
again
but
that
night
a
squall
came
up
and
in
half
an
hour
we
were
running
down
to
the
land
when
the
lights
on
the
beach
showed
up
we
until
daylight
and
then
found
the
surf
too
heavy
to
let
us
land
we
got
in
close
to
the
reef
and
could
see
that
the
was
full
for
there
were
also
hundreds
of
bags
outside
awaiting
our
boats
it
was
clearly
worth
staying
for
the
trader
a
tall
thin
man
came
down
to
the
water
edge
waved
his
long
arm
and
then
turned
back
and
sat
down
on
a
bag
of
copra
we
went
about
and
passed
the
village
again
and
once
more
the
long
man
came
to
the
water
edge
waved
his
arm
and
retired
to
his
seat
in
the
afternoon
we
saw
a
native
and
charley
together
among
the
bags
then
the
native
left
him
and
as
it
was
now
low
tide
the
kanaka
was
able
to
walk
to
the
edge
of
the
reef
where
he
signalled
to
us
seeing
that
he
meant
to
swim
off
the
skipper
went
in
as
close
as
possible
and
backed
his
foreyard
watching
his
chance
for
a
lull
in
the
yet
fierce
breakers
the
native
slid
over
the
reef
and
swam
out
to
us
as
only
a
line
islander
or
a
tokelau
man
can
swim
how
charley
we
asked
when
the
dark
man
reached
the
deck
who
charley
oh
he

bowels
are
filled
with
the
sea

dollar

a

with
a
small
coir

and
sent

ashore
by
the
nanomea
man
charley
and
a
number
of
natives
came
to
the
edge
of
the
reef
to
lend
a
hand
in
landing
the
bearer
of
the
treasure
then
they
all
waded
back
to
the
beach
headed
by
the
white
man
in
the
dirty
pyjamas
and
fala
hat
reaching
his
house
he
turned
his
following
away
and
shut

our
profane

thoughtfully
we
started
weighing
and
shipping
the
copra
next
day
after
finishing
up
the
solemn
charley
invited
the
skipper
and
supercargo
to
remain
ashore
till
morning
his
great
trouble
he
told
us
was
that
he
had
not
yet
secured
a
wife
a
wife
he
had
unluckily
lost
the
run
of
the
last
mrs
charley
during
his
absence
at
another
island
of
the
group
and
negotiations
with
various
local
young
women
had
been
broken
off
owing
to
his
having
run
out
of
trade
in
the
south
seas
as
in
the
civilised
world
generally
to
get
the
girl
of
your
heart
is
usually
a
mere
matter
of
trade
there
were
he
told
us
with
a
melancholy
look
some
fine
nukunau
girls
here
on
a
visit
but
the
one
i
want
do
seem
to
care
much
about
stayin
unless
all
this
new
trade
fetches
her
who
is
she
enquired
the
skipper
tibakwa
daughter
let
have
a
look
at
her
said
the
skipper
a
man
of
kind
impulses
who
felt
sorry
at
the
intermittency
of
the
long
one
connubial
relations
the
tall
scraggy
trader
shambled
to
the
door
and
bawled
out
tibakwa
tibakwa
tibakwa
o
three
times
the
people
singing
in
the
big
moniep
or
stopped
their
monotonous
droning
and
the
name
of
tibakwa
was
yelled
vociferously
the
village
in
true
gilbert
group
style
in
the
gilberts
if
a
native
in
one
corner
of
a
house
speaks
to
another
in
the
opposite
he
bawls
loud
enough
to
be
heard
a
mile
off
tibakwa
the
shark
was
a
short
squat
fellow
with
his
broad
back
and
chest
scored
and
seamed
with
an
intricate
and
inartistic
network
of
cicatrices
made
by
sharks
teeth
swords
his
hair
straight
coarse
and
was
cut
away
square
from
just
above
his
eyebrows
to
the
top
of
his
ears
leaving
his
fierce
countenance
in
a
sort
of
frame
each
bore
a
load
one
had
two
or
three
sticks
of
tobacco
twined
in
and
about
the
distended
circle
of
flesh
and
the
other
a
and
wooden
pipe
stripped
to
the
waist
he
showed
his
muscular
outlines
to
perfection
and
he
sat
down
unasked
in
the
bold
manner
natural
to
the
line
islander
where
tirau
asked
the
trader
here
said
the
man
of
wounds
pointing
outside
and
he
called
out
in
a
voice
like
the
bellow
of
a
bull
tirau
o
nako
mai
come
here
tirau
came
in
timidly
clothed
only
in
an
airiri
or
girdle
and
slunk
into
a
far
corner
the
melancholy
trader
and
the
father
pulled
her
out
and
she
dumped
herself
down
in
the
middle
of
the
room
with
a
muttered
e
puak

bad
white

fine

charley
said
the
skipper
digging
him
in
the
ribs

to

little

then
began
anew

willing

to

the
astute
charley
brought
out
some
new
trade
tirau

here

a
faint

charley
threw
her
with
the
air
of
a
prince
a
whole
piece
of
turkey

three
dollars

about
tirau
put
out
a
little
hand
and
drew
it
gingerly
toward
her
tibakwa
gave
us
an
atrocious
wink
she
cottoned
exclaimed
charley
and
thus
without
empty
and
hollow
display
were
two
loving
hearts
made
to
beat
as
one
as
a
practical
proof
of
the
solemnity
of
the
occasion
the
bridegroom
then
and
there
gave
tirau
his
bunch
of
keys
which
she
carefully
tied
to
a
strand
of
her
airiri
and
smoking
one
of
the
captain
manillas
she
proceeded
to
bash
out
the
mosquitoes
from
the
nuptial
couch
with
a
fan
we
assisted
her
an
hour
afterwards
to
hoist
the
sleeping
body
of
long
charley
therein
and
telling
her
to
bathe
his
head
in
the
morning
with
cold
water
we
rose
to
go
tirau
we
said
tiakapo
said
the
good
little
wife
as
she
rolled
up
an
empty
square
gin
bottle
in
one
of
charley
shirts
for
a
pillow
and
disposed
her
graceful
figure
on
the
matted
floor
beside
his
bed
to
fight
mosquitoes
until
daylight
the
methodical
mr
burr
of
maduro
one
day
ned
burr
a
fellow
trader
walked
slowly
up
the
path
to
my
station
and
with
a
friendly
nod
sat
down
and
watched
intently
as
with
native
assistance
i
set
about
salting
some
pork
ned
lived
thirty
miles
from
my
place
on
a
little
island
at
the
entrance
to
the
lagoon
he
was
a
prosperous
man
and
only
drank
under
the
pressure
of
the
monotony
caused
by
the
of
a
ship
to
buy
his
produce
he
would
then
close
his
store
and
aided
by
a
number
of
friendly
male
natives
start
on
a
case
of
gin
but
never
a
woman
went
into
house
though
many
visited
the
store
where
ned
bought
their
produce
paid
for
it
in
trade
or
cash
and
sent
them
off
after
treating
them
on
a
strictly
business
basis
now
the
marshall
island
women
much
resented
this
since
ned
wife
had
died
ten
years
previously
the
women
backed
by
the
chiefs
had
made
most
decided
but
withal
diplomatic
assaults
upon
his
celibacy
the
old
men
of
his
village
had
respectfully
and
repeatedly
reminded
him
that
his
state
of
singleness
was
not
a
direct
slight
to
themselves
as
leading
men
alone
if
he
refused
to
marry
again
he
surely
would
not
cast
such
a
reflection
upon
the
personal
characters
of
some
two
or
three
hundred
young
girls
as
to
refuse
a
few
of
them
the
position
of
honorary
wives
pro
or
until
he
found
one
whom
he
might
think
worthy
of
higher
honours
but
the
methodical
trader
only
opened
a
bottle
of
gin
gave
them
fair
words
and
a
drink
all
round
and
absolutely
declined
to
open
any
sort
of
matrimonial
negotiations
i
come
to
hev
some
talk
with
you
when
you
finished
saltin
he
said
as
he
rose
and
meditatively
prodded
a
junk
of
meat
with
his
forefinger
right
old
man
i
said
i
come
now
and
we
went
into
the
big
room
and
sat
down
air
ye
game
ter
come
and
see
me
get
married
he
asked
looking
away
past
me
through
the
open
door
to
where
the
surf
thundered
and
tumbled
on
the
outer
reef
ned
i
said
solemnly
i
know
you
do
joke
so
you
must
mean
it
of
course
i
will
i
sure
all
of
us
fellows
will
be
delighted
to
hear
you
going
to
get
some
nice
little
carajz
an
unmarried
girl
to
lighten
up
that
big
house
of
yours
over
there
who
the
girl
ned
whew
i
said
why
she
the
daughter
of
the
biggest
chief
on
arhnu
i
did
think
any
white
man
could
get
her
even
if
he
gave
her
people
a
of
dollars
as
a
well
no
said
ned
stroking
his
beard
meditatively
i
suppose
i
should
feel
a
bit
set
up
but
two
years
ago
her
people
said
that
because
i
stood
to
them
in
the
matter
of
some
rifles
when
they
had
trouble
with
king
jibberick
i
could
take
her
she
was
rather
young
then
any
way
but
i
been
over
to
arhnu
several
times
and
i
had
spies
out
and
damn
me
if
i
ever
could
hear
a
whisper
agin
her
told
for
sure
that
her
father
and
uncles
would
ha
killed
any
one
that
came
after
her
so
i
to
take
her
and
chance
it
ned
i
said
you
know
your
own
affairs
and
these
people
better
than
i
do
yet
are
you
really
going
to
pin
your
faith
on
a
marshall
island
girl
you
are
not
like
any
of
us
traders
you
see
we
know
what
to
expect
sometimes
and
our
morals
are
a
lot
worse
than
those
of
the
natives
and
it
does
harrow
our
feelings
much
if
any
one
of
us
has
to
divorce
a
wife
and
get
another
it
only
means
a
lot
of
new
dresses
and
some
guzzling
drinking
and
speechifying
and
some
bother
in
teaching
the
new
wife
how
to
make
bread
but
your
wife
that
died
was
a
manhikian
another
kind
they
do
breed
that
sort
here
in
the
marshalls
think
of
it
twice
ned
before
you
marry
her
the
girl
was
a
beauty
there
are
many
like
her
in
that
cluster
of
coral
atolls
that
she
was
a
chief
child
it
was
easy
to
see
the
abject
manner
in
which
the
commoner
natives
always
behaved
themselves
in
her
presence
showed
their
respect
for
of
course
we
all
got
very
jolly
there
were
half
a
dozen
of
us
traders
there
and
we
were
for
a
wonder
all
on
friendly
terms
sat
on
a
fine
mat
in
the
big
room
and
in
a
sweetly
dignified
manner
received
the
one
of
our
number
charlie
de
buis
though
in
a
state
of
chronic
poverty
induced
by
steadfast
adherence
to
square
gin
at
five
dollars
a
case
made
his
offerings
a
gold
locket
covering
a
miniature
a
heavy
gold
ring
and
a
pair
of
fat
muscovy
ducks
the
bride
accepted
them
with
a
smile
who
is
this
she
asked
looking
at
the
portrait
your
white
wife
no
replied
the
bashful
charles
another
man
that
why
i
give
it
away
curse
her
but
the
ducks
i
bred
myself
on
madurocaron
a
month
or
two
passed
then
on
one
sunday
afternoon
about
dusk
i
saw
ned
coming
over
across
the
lagoon
i
met
him
on
the
beach
trouble
was
in
his
face
yet
his
hard
impassive
features
were
such
that
only
those
who
knew
him
well
could
discover
it
instead
of
entering
the
house
he
silently
motioned
me
to
come
further
along
the
sand
where
we
reached
an
open
spot
clear
of
coco
palms
ned
sat
down
and
filled
his
pipe
i
waited
patiently
the
wind
had
died
away
and
the
soft
swish
and
swirl
of
the
tide
as
the
ripples
lapped
the
beach
was
the
only
sound
that
broke
upon
the
silence
of
the
night
you
were
right
but
it
does
matter
now
he
laughed
softly
a
week
ago
a
arrived
from
ebon
there
were
two
chiefs
of
course
they
came
to
my
house
to
trade
they
had
plenty
of
money
there
were
about
a
hundred
natives
belonging
to
them
the
younger
man
was
chief
of
likieb
a
flash
buck
the
first
day
he
saw
he
had
a
lot
too
much
to
say
to
her
i
watched
him
next
morning
my
came
and
told
me
that
the
flash
young
chief
from
likieb
had
stuck
him
up
and
drank
my
toddy
and
had
said
something
about
my
wife
you
know
how
they
talk
in
parables
when
they
mean
mischief
i
would
have
shot
him
for
the
toddy
racket
but
i
was
waitin
for
a
better
reason
the
old
hag
who
bosses
my
said
to
me
as
she
passed
and
listen
to
a
song
of
cunning
over
there
pointing
to
a
clump
of
trees
i
walked
over
quietly
and
her
girls
were
sitting
down
on
mats
outside
the
fence
was
a
lad
singing
this
in
a
low
voice
hides
the
tricks
of
lovers
and
the
girls
bent
their
heads
and
said
nothing
then
the
devil
imp
commenced
again
hides
the
tricks
of
lovers
some
of
the
girls
laughed
and
whispered
to
she
shook
her
head
and
looked
around
timorously
plain
enough
was
it
presently
the
boy
creeps
up
to
the
fence
and
drops
over
a
wreath
of
yellow
blossoms
the
girls
laughed
one
of
them
picked
it
up
and
offered
it
to
she
waved
it
away
then
again
the
cub
outside
sang
softly
hides
the
tricks
of
lovers
and
they
all
laughed
again
and
put
the
wreath
on
her
head
and
i
saw
the
brown
hide
of
the
boy
disappear
among
the
trees
i
went
back
to
the
house
i
wanted
to
make
certain
she
would
follow
the
boy
first
after
a
few
minutes
some
of
women
came
to
me
and
said
they
were
going
to
the
weather
side
of
the
island
it
narrer
across
as
you
know
to
pick
flowers
i
said
all
right
to
go
as
i
was
going
to
do
something
else
so
could
come
with
them
then
i
went
to
the
and
got
what
i
wanted
the
old
showed
me
the
way
they
had
gone
and
grinned
when
she
saw
what
i
had
slid
down
inside
my
pyjamas
i
cut
round
and
got
to
the
place
i
had
a
right
good
idea
where
it
was
the
girls
soon
came
along
the
path
and
then
stopped
and
talked
to
and
pointed
to
a
clump
of
trees
standing
in
an
patch
she
seemed
frightened
but
went
through
she
stopped
and
then
i
saw
my
beauty
raise
his
head
from
the
ground
and
march
over
to
her
i
jest
giv
him
time
ter
enjoy
a
smile
and
then
i
stepped
out
and
toppled
him
over
right
through
his
carcase
them
sharp
rifle
make
a
hole
you
could
put
your
fist
into
the
girl
dropped
too
sheer
funk
old
lebauro
the
cook
slid
through
the
trees
and
stood
over
him
and
said
guk
he
a
man
and
gave
me
her
knife
and
then
i
collared
and
for
god
sake
ned
do
tell
me
you
killed
her
too
he
shook
his
head
slowly
no
i
could
hurt
her
but
i
held
her
with
one
hand
she
feeling
dead
and
cold
like
a
wet
then
the
old
undid
my
flash
man
long
hair
and
twining
her
skinny
old
claws
in
it
pulled
it
taut
while
i
sawed
at
the
chap
neck
with
my
right
hand
the
knife
was
heavy
and
sharp
and
i
soon
got
the
job
through
then
i
gave
the
thing
to
to
carry
i
made
her
walk
in
front
of
me
every
time
she
dropped
the
head
i
slewed
her
round
and
made
her
lift
it
up
again
and
the
old
trotted
astern
o
us
when
we
came
close
to
the
town
i
says
to
you
want
to
live
says
she
in
a
voice
like
a
whisper
sing
says
i
loud
hides
the
tricks
of
lovers
and
she
sang
it
in
a
choky
kind
of
quaver
there
was
a
great
rush
o
people
ter
see
the
procession
they
stood
in
a
line
on
both
sides
of
the
path
and
stared
and
said
nothin
presently
we
comes
to
where
all
the
likieb
chief
people
was
quartered
they
knew
the
head
and
ran
back
for
their
rifles
but
my
crowd
in
the
village
was
too
strong
and
o
course
sided
with
me
and
took
away
their
guns
then
the
crowd
gathers
round
my
place
and
i
makes
hold
up
the
head
and
sing
again
sing
that
chant
i
says
to
the
people
to
my
wife
singing
a
love
song
then
i
takes
the
thing
wet
and
bloody
and
slings
it
into
the
middle
of
the
likieb
people
and
gave
a
shove
and
sent
her
inside
i
was
thinking
what
would
be
the
best
thing
to
say
and
could
only
manage
it
a
bad
business
ned
bad
that
where
you
wrong
and
rising
ned
brushed
the
sand
off
the
legs
of
his
pyjamas
it
just
about
the
luckiest
thing
as
could
ha
happened
ye
see
it
given
a
good
idea
of
what
may
happen
to
her
if
she
ai
mighty
correct
an
it
riz
me
a
lot
in
the
esteem
of
the
people
generally
as
a
man
who
hez

truly
great
man

an

in

answered

requirements
he
was
generally
a
rough
character
a
runaway
from
some
australian

american
whaler
or
a
wandering
ishmael

for
reasons
of
his
own
preferred
living
among

people
of

equatorial

dreaming
away

native
wife
over
whose
bared
shoulders
and
bosom
fell
long
waves
of
black
hair
with
her
was
a
child
about
five
years
old
the
second
mate
of
the
whaler
who
was
in
charge
of
the
boat
not
liking
the
looks
of
the
excited
natives
who
swarmed
around
the
newcomer
bade
him
a
hurried
farewell
and
pushed
away
to
the
ship
which
off
the
passage
with
her
aback
then
the
clamorous
people
pressed
more
closely
around
probyn
and
his
wife
and
assailed
them
with
questions
so
far
neither
of
them
had
spoken
probyn
a
tall
wiry
man
with
quiet
eyes
was
standing
with
one
foot
on
the
tierce
of
tobacco
and
his
hands
in
his
pockets
his
wife
glared
defiantly
at
some
two
or
three
score
of
women
who
crowded
eagerly
around
her
to
stare
into
her
face
holding
to
the
sleeve
of
her
dress
was
the
child
paralysed
into
the
silence
of
fright
the
deafening
babble
and
frantic
gesticulations
were
perfectly
explicable
to
probyn
and
he
apprehended
no
danger
the
head
man
of
the
village
had
not
yet
appeared
and
until
he
came
this
wild
license
of
behaviour
would
continue
at
last
the
natives
became
silent
and
parted
to
the
right
and
left
as
tahori
the
head
man
his
fat
body
shining
with
coconut
oil
and
carrying
an
club
in
his
hand
stood
in
front
of
the
white
man
and
eyed
him
up
and
down
the
scrutiny
seemed
satisfactory
he
stretched
out
his
huge
naked
arm
and
shook
hand
uttering
his
one
word
of
samoan
talofa
my
love
to
you
the
samoan
salutation
and
then
in
his
own
dialect
he
asked
what
is
your
name
and
what
do
you
want
sam
replied
probyn
and
then
in
the
tokelau
language
which
the
people
around
him
fairly
understood
i
have
come
here
to
live
with
you
and
trade
for
oil
and
he
pointed
to
the
tierce
of
tobacco
where
are
you
from
from
the
land
called
nukunono
in
the
tokelau
why
come
here
because
i
killed
an
enemy
there
good
grunted
the
fat
man
there
are
no
twists
in
thy
tongue
but
why
did
the
boat
hasten
away
so
quickly
they
were
frightened
because
of
the
noise
he
with
the
face
like
a
fowl
talked
too
much
and
he
pointed
to
a
long
native
who
had
been
especially
turbulent
and
vociferous
ha
and
the
fat
bearded
face
of
tahori
turned
from
the
white
man
to
him
of
whom
the
white
man
had
spoken
is
it
thee
makoi
and
so
thou
madest
the
strangers
hasten
away
that
was
wrong
only
for
thee
i
had
gone
to
the
ship
and
gotten
many
things
come
hither
then
he
stooped
and
picked
up
one
of
probyn
muskets
handed
it
to
the
white
man
and
silently
indicated
the
tall
native
with
a
nod
the
other
natives
fell
back
niabong
probyn
wife
set
her
boy
on
his
feet
put
her
hand
in
her
bosom
and
drew
out
a
key
with
which
she
opened
the
chest
she
threw
back
the
lid
fixed
her
black
eyes
on
probyn
and
waited
probyn
holding
the
musket
in
his
left
hand
mused
a
moment
then
he
asked
whose
man
is
he
mine
said
tahori
he
is
from
oaitupu
and
my
bondman
hath

a

species
of
taro

growing
on
the
atolls
of
the
field
good
said
probyn
and
he
motioned
to
his
wife
she
dived
her
hand
into
the
chest
and
handed
him
a
tin
of
powder
then
a
bullet
a
cap
and
some
scraps
of
paper
slowly
he
loaded
the
musket
and
tahori
seizing
the
bondman
by
his
arm
led
him
out
to
the
open
and
stood
by
club
in
hand
on
the
alert

knew
his
reputation
depended
on
the
shot
he
raised
his
musket
and
fired
the
ball

through
the
chest
of
makoi
then
four
men
picked
up
the
body
and
carried
it
into
a
house
probyn
laid
down
the
musket
and
motioned
again
to
niabong
she
handed
him
a
hatchet
and
blunt
chisel
tahori
smiled
pleasantly
and
drawing
the
little
boy
to
him
patted
his
head
then
at
a
sign
from
him
a
woman
brought
niabong
a
shell
of
sweet
toddy
the
chief
sat
and
watched
probyn
opening
the
tierce
of
tobacco

box
again
and
sat
upon
it

said
a
young
native
girl
slid
out
from
the
coconut
grove
at
bidding
and
stood
behind
him
holding
a
basket

doctor

from
a
polynesian
standpoint
oho
said
lagisiva
the
widow
tossing
her
hair
back
over
her
shoulders
as
she
raised
the
heavy
fluted
tappa
mallet
in
her
thick
strong
right
hand
and
dealt
the
rough
cloth
a
series
of
quick
strokes
oho
said
the
lagisiva
looking
up
at
the
white
man
because
i
be
a
woman
dost
think
me
a
fool
i
tell
thee
i
know
some
of
the
customs
of
the
papalagi
the
white
foreigners
much
wisdom
have
ye
in
many
things
but
again
i
tell
thee
o
friend
of
my
sons
that
in
some
other
things
the
people
of
thy
nation
ay
of
all
white
nations
they
be
as
the
beasts
of
the
forest
the
wild
goat
and
pig
without
reason
and
without
shame
tah
has
not
my
eldest
son
tui
fau
whom
the
white
men
call
bob
lived
for
seven
years
in
sini
sydney
when
he
returned
from
those
places
by
new
guinea
where
he
was
diver
and
he
has
filled
my
ears
with
the
bad
and
shameless
customs
of
the
papalagi
isa
i
say
again
thy
women
have
not
the
shame
of
ours
the
heat
of
desire
devoureth
chastity
even
in
those
of
one
blood
in
what
do
they
offend
o
my
mother
aue
life
is
short
and
behold
this
piece
of
siapo
the
tappa
cloth
of
the
south
seas
made
from
the
bark
of
the
paper
mulberry
is
for
a
wedding
present
and
i
must
hurry
but
yet
put
down
thy
gun
and
bag
and
we
shall
smoke
awhile
and
thou
shalt
feel
shame
while
i
tell
of
one
of
the
papalagi
customs
the
marrying
of
brother
and
sister
nay
mother
said
the
white
man
not
brother
and
sister
but
only
cousins
isa
an
expression
of
contempt
and
the
big
widow
spat
scornfully
on
the
ground
those
are
words
words
it
is
the
same
the
same
is
the
blood
the
same
is
the
bone
even
in
our
heathen
days
we
pointed
the
finger
at
one
who
looked
with
the
eye
of
love
on
the
daughter
of
his
father
brother
or
sister
for
such
did
we
let
his
blood
out
upon
the
sand
and
i
old
lagisiva
have
seen
a
white
man
brought
to
shame
through
this
wickedness
tell
me
said
the
white
man
he
was
a
doctor
and
rich
and
came
here
because
he
desired
to
see
strange
places
and
was
weary
of
his
life
in
the
land
of
the
papalagi
so
he
remained
with
us
and
hunted
the
wild
boar
with
our
young
men
and
became
strong
and
hardy
and
like
unto
one
of
our
people
and
then
because
he
was
for
ever
restless
he
sailed
away
once
and
returned
in
a
small
ship
and
brought
back
trade
and
built
a
store
and
a
fine
house
to
dwell
in
the
chief
of
this
town
gave
him
for
friendship
a
piece
of
land
over
there
by
the
and
thus
did
he
become
a
still
greater
man
his
store
was
full
of
rich
goods
and
he
kept
many
servants
and
at
his
house
was
as
a
blaze
of
fire
for
the
young
men
and
women
would
go
there
and
sing
and
dance
and
he
had
many
lovers
amongst
our
young
girls
i
old
lagisiva
who
am
now
fat
and
dull
was
one
oho
he
was
a
man
of
plenty
did
a
girl
but
look
out
between
her
eyelashes
at
a
piece
of
print
in
the
store
lo
it
was
hers
even
though
it
measured
twenty
fathoms
in
length
and
print
was
a
dollar
a
fathom
in
those
days
so
every
girl
even
those
from
parts
far
off
cast
herself
in
his
way
that
he
might
notice
her
and
he
was
generous
to
all
alike
in
that
alone
was
wisdom
once
or
twice
every
year
the
ships
brought
him
letters
and
he
would
count
the
marks
on
the
paper
and
tell
us
that
they
came
from
a
woman
of
the
papalagi
his
cousin
as
you
would
call
her
whose
picture
was
hung
over
his
table
she
was
for
ever
smiling
down
upon
us
and
her
eyes
were
his
eyes
and
if
he
but
smiled
then
were
the
two
alike
alike
as
are
two
children
of
the
same
birth
when
three
years
had
come
and
gone
a
ship
brought
him
a
letter
and
that
night
there
were
many
of
us
at
his
house
men
and
women
to
talk
with
the
people
from
the
ship
when
those
had
gone
away
to
their
sleep
he
called
to
the
chief
and
said
two
days
o
my
friend
i
set
out
for
my
land
again
but
to
return
for
much
do
i
desire
to
remain
with
you
always
in
six
months
i
shall
be
here
again
and
there
is
one
thing
i
would
speak
of
i
shall
bring
back
a
white
wife
a
woman
of
my
own
country
whom
i
have
loved
for
many
years
then
the
chief
who
was
my
father
father
and
very
old
said
shall
be
my
daughter
and
welcome
and
many
of
us
young
girls
said
also
shall
be
welcome
although
we
felt
sorrowful
to
lose
a
lover
so
good
and
and
then
did
the
call
to
the
old
chief
and
two
others
and
they
entered
the
store
and
lighted
lamps
and
presently
a
man
went
forth
into
the
village
and
cried
aloud
hither
all
people
and
listen
so
many
hundreds
came
and
we
all
went
in
and
found
the
floor
covered
with
some
of
everything
that
the
white
man
possessed
and
the
chief
spoke
and
said
my
people
this
our
good
friend
goeth
away
to
his
own
country
that
he
may
bring
back
a
wife
and
because
many
young
unmarried
girls
will
say
why
does
he
leave
us
are
not
we
as
good
to
look
upon
as
this
other
woman
does
he
put
these
presents
here
on
the
ground
and
these
words
into
my
mouth
out
of
his
love
to
you
which
must
be
a
thing
that
is
past
and
forgotten
the
wife
that
is
coming
must
not
know
of
some
little
things
that
is
papalagi
custom
and
then
every
girl
that
had
a
wish
took
whatever
she
fancied
and
the
white
man
charged
us
to
say
naught
that
would
arouse
the
anger
of
the
wife
that
was
to
come
and
so
he
departed
one
hundred
and
ten
fat
hogs
killed
we
and
roasted
whole
for
the
feast
of
welcome
i
swear
it
by
the
holy
ones
of
god
kingdom
one
hundred
and
ten
and
yet
this
white
lily
of
his
never
smiled
not
even
on
us
young
girls
who
danced
and
sang
before
her
only
she
clung
to
his
arm
and
behold
when
we
drew
close
to
her
we
saw
it
was
the
woman
in
the
picture
his
sister
and
then
one
by
one
all
those
that
had
gathered
to
do
him
honour
went
away
in
shame
shame
that
he
should
do
this
wed
his
own
sister
and
many
women
said
worse
of
her
but
yet
the
feast
the
hogs
and
yams
and
taro
and
fish
and
fowls
was
brought
and
placed
by
his
doorstep
but
no
one
spake
and
at
he
was
alone
with
his
wife
till
he
sent
for
the
old
chief
and
reproached
him
with
bitter
words
for
the
coldness
of
the
people
and
asked
is
this
and
the
old
man
pointed
to
the
picture
over
the
table
and
said
this
she
thy
wife
said
the
white
man
she
not
of
the
same
blood
as
thyself
so
said
he
shalt
thou
live
alone
in
thy
shame
said
the
old
man
and
he
went
away
so
for
many
months
these
two
lived
he
found
some
to
work
for
him
and
some
young
girls
to
tend
his
sister
whom
he
called
his
wife
whilst
she
lay
ill
with
her
first
child
and
the
day
after
it
was
born
some
one
whispered
is
accursed
the
child
cries
not
it
is
dumb
for
a
week
it
lived
yet
never
did
it
cry
for
the
curse
of
wickedness
was
upon
it
then
the
white
man
nursed
her
tenderly
and
took
her
away
to
live
in
fiji
for
six
months
when
they
came
back
it
was
the
same
no
one
cared
to
go
inside
his
house
and
he
cursed
us
and
said
he
would
bring
men
from
tokelau
to
work
for
him
we
said
naught
then
in
time
another
child
was
born
and
it
was
hideous
to
look
upon
and
that
also
died
now
there
was
a
girl
amongst
us
whose
name
was
suni
to
whom
the
white
woman
spoke
much
for
she
was
learning
our
tongue
and
suni
by
reason
of
the
white
woman
many
presents
spoke
openly
to
her
and
told
her
of
the
village
talk
then
the
white
woman
wept
and
arose
and
spoke
to
the
man
for
a
long
while
and
she
came
back
to
suni
and
said
thou
hast
told
me
was
in
my
own
heart
three
years
ago
yet
because
it
is
the
custom
of
my
people
i
married
this
man
who
is
the
son
of
my
father
brother
but
now
i
shall
go
away
then
the
white
man
came
out
and
beat
suni
with
a
stick
but
yet
was
his
sister
whom
he
called
his
wife
eaten
up
with
shame
and
when
a
ship
came
they
went
away
and
we
saw
her
not
again
for
about
two
years
we
heard
no
more
of
our
white
man
till
he
returned
and
said
the
woman
was
dead
and
he
took
suni
for
wife
who
bore
him
three
children
and
then
they
went
away
to
some
other
country
i
know
not
where
i
thank
thee
many
many
times
o
friend
of
my
sons
four
children
of
mine
here
live
in
this
village
yet
not
a
one
of
them
ever
asketh
me
when
i
last
smoked

god

with
thee
always
for
this
stick
of
tobacco
the
fate
of
the
alida
three
years
ago
in
an
australian
paper
i
read
something
that
set
me
thinking
of
taplin
of
taplin
and
his
wife
and
the
fate
of
the
alida
this
is
what
i
read

vessel
got
to
sea
they
murdered
the
captain
a
passenger
the
supercargo
mr
gibson
of
sydney
and
two
sailors
and
threw
their
bodies
overboard
the
movers
in
the
affair
were
arrested
at
ponape
in
the
caroline
islands
the
vessel
belonged
to
a
tahitian
prince
and
was
called
the
nuroahiti
but
its
name
had
been
changed
after
the
tragedy
the
accused
persons
were
sent
to
manilla
from
manilla
they
appear
now
to
have
been
sent
on
to
france
note
by
the
the
brothers
rorique
were
sentenced
to
imprisonment
for
life
at
brest
in
in
the
year
we
were
lying
inside
funafuti
lagoon
in
the
ellice
group
the
last
cask
of
oil
had
been
towed
off
to
the
brig
and
placed
under
hatches
and
we
were
to
sail
in
the
morning
for
our
usual
cruise
among
the
gilbert
and
kingsmill
islands
our
captain
a
white
trader
from
the
shore
and
myself
were
sitting
on
deck
yarning
and
smoking
we
lay
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
beach
such
a
beach
white
as
the
driven
snow
and
sweeping
in
a
great
curve
for
five
long
miles
to
the
north
and
a
lesser
distance
to
the
south
and
west
right
abreast
of
the
brig
nestling
like
huge
nests
in
the
shade
of
groves
of
coconut
and
trees
were
the
houses
of
the
principal
village
in
funafuti
presently
the
skipper
picked
up
his
glasses
that
lay
beside
him
on
the
skylight
and
looked
away
down
to
leeward
where
the
white
sails
of
a
schooner
beating
up
to
the
anchorage
were
outlined
against
the
line
of
palms
that
fringed
the
beach
of
funafala
the
westernmost
island
that
forms
one
of
the
chain
enclosing
funafuti
lagoon
it
taplin
schooner
right
enough
he
said
let
us
go
ashore
and
give
him
and
his
pretty
wife
a
hand
to
pack
up
taplin
was
the
name
of
the
only
other
white
trader
on
funafuti
besides
old
tom
humphreys
our
own
man
he
had
been
two
years
on
the
island
and
was
trading
in
opposition
to
our
trader
as
agent
for
a
foreign
house
our
owners
were
sydney
people
but
his
firm
unscrupulous
method
of
doing
business
had
disgusted
him
so
one
day
he
told
the
supercargo
of
their
vessel
that
he
would
trade
for
them
no
longer
than
the
exact
time
he
had
agreed
upon
two
years
he
had
come
to
funafuti
from
the
pelews
and
was
now
awaiting
the
return
of
his
firm
vessel
to
take
him
back
there
again
getting
into
our
boat
we
were
pulled
ashore
and
landed
on
the
beach
in
front
of
the
trader
house
well
taplin
here
your
schooner
at
last
said
old
tom
as
we
shook
hands
and
seated
ourselves
in
the
comfortable
room
i
see
you
getting
ready
to
go
taplin
was
a
man
of
about
thirty
or
so
with
a
quiet
impassive
face
and
dark
eyes
that
gave
to
his
features
a
somewhat
gloomy
look
except
when
he
smiled
which
was
not
often
men
with
that
curious
look
in
their
eyes
are
not
uncommon
among
the
lonely
islands
of
the
wide
pacific
sometimes
it
comes
to
a
man
with
long
long
years
of
wandering
to
and
fro
and
you
will
see
it
deepen
when
by
some
idle
chance
word
you
move
the
memories
of
a
forgotten
past
ere
he
had
even
dreamed
of
the
existence
of
the
south
sea
islands
and
for
ever
dissevered
himself
from
all
links
and
associations
of
the
outside
world
yes
he
answered
i
am
nearly
ready
i
saw
the
schooner
at
daylight
and
knew
it
was
the
alida
where
do
you
think
of
going
to
taplin
i
asked
back
to
the
carolines
nerida
belongs
down
that
way
you
know
and
she
is
fretting
to
get
back
again
otherwise
i
would
leave
this
island
i
done
pretty
well
here
although
the
people
i
trade
for
are
well
you
know
what
they
are
aye
assented
old
humphreys
there
is
one
of
but
what
is
the
two
ends
and
bight
of
a
scoundrel
and
that
supercargo
with
the
yaller
moustache
and
womany
hands
is
the
worst
of
the
lot
i
wonder
if
aboard
this
trip
i
do
let
him
inside
my
house
i
got
too
many
daughters
and
they
all
think
him
a
fine
man
nerida
taplin
wife
came
out
to
us
from
an
inner
room
she
was
a
native
of
one
of
the
pelew
islands
a
tall
girl
with
pale
olive
skin
and
big
soft
eyes
a
flowing
gown
of
yellow
muslin
the
favourite
colour
of
the
natives
of
the
pelews
buttoned
high
up
to
her
throat
draped
her
graceful
figure
after
putting
her
little
hand
in
ours
and
greeting
us
in
the
funafuti
dialect
she
went
over
to
taplin
and
touching
his
arm
pointed
out
the
schooner
that
was
now
only
a
mile
or
so
away
and
a
smile
parted
her
lips
and
the
eyes
glowed
and
filled
with
a
tender
light
i
felt
captain
warren
touch
my
arm
as
he
rose
and
went
outside
i
followed
l
said
warren
ca
we
do
something
for
taplin
ourselves
is
there
a
station
anywhere
about
tonga
or
wallis
island
that
would
suit
him
would
he
come
warren
he
or
rather
that
pretty
wife
of
his
seems
bent
upon
going
away
in
the
schooner
to
the
carolines
aye
said
the
skipper
that
it
if
it
were
any
other
vessel
i
would
care
then
suddenly
that
fellow
motley
the
supercargo
is
a
damned
scoundrel
capable
of
any
villainy
where
a
woman
is
concerned
did
you
ever
hear
about
old
raymond
daughter
down
at
mangareva
i
had
heard
the
story
very
often
by
means
of
a
forged
letter
purporting
to
have
been
written
by
her
father
an
old
english
trader
in
the
gambier
group
motley
had
lured
the
beautiful
young
away
from
a
school
in
san
francisco
and
six
months
afterwards
turned
her
adrift
on
the
streets
of
honolulu
raymond
was
a
lonely
man
and
passionately
attached
to
his
only
child
so
no
one
wondered
when
reaching
california
a
year
after
and
finding
her
gone
he
shot
himself
in
his
room
at
an
hotel
i
will
ask
him
anyway
i
said
and
as
we
went
back
into
the
house
the
alida
shot
past
our
line
of
vision
through
the
and
brought
up
inside
the
brig
taplin
i
said
would
you
care
about
taking
one
of
our
stations
to
the
eastward
name
any
island
you
fancy
and
we
will
land
you
there
with
the
pick
of
our
room
thank
you
i
would
be
only
too
glad
but
i
can
not
i
have
promised
nerida
to
go
back
to
babelthouap
or
somewhere
in
the
pelews
and
motley
has
promised
to
land
us
at
ponape
in
the
carolines
we
can
get
away
from
there
in
one
of
the
dutch
firm
vessels
i
am
very
sorry
taplin
i
began
when
old
captain
warren
burst
in
with
look
here
taplin
we
have
got
much
time
to
talk
here
the
alida
boat
coming
with
that
blank
blank
scoundrel
motley
in
it
take
my
advice
do
go
away
in
the
alida
and
then
he
looked
at
nerida
and
whispered
something
a
red
spark
shone
in
taplin
dark
eyes
then
he
pressed
warren
hand
i
know
he
answered
he
a
most
infernal
villain
nerida
hates
him
too
but
you
see
how
i
am
fixed
the
alida
is
our
only
chance
of
getting
back
to
the
but
he
has
got
old
raymond
to
deal
with
in
me
here
they
are
motley
came
in
first
hat
and
fan
in
hand
he
was
a
man
with
blue
eyes
and
an
unusually
fair
skin
for
an
island
supercargo
with
a
long
drooping
yellow
moustache
riedermann
the
skipper
who
followed
was
stout
coarse
and
brutal
how
are
you
gentlemen
said
motley
affably
turning
from
taplin
and
his
wife
and
advancing
towards
us
captain
riedermann
and
i
saw
the
spars
of
your
brig
showing
up
over
the
coconuts
yesterday
and
therefore
knew
we
should
have
the
pleasure
of
meeting
you
warren
looked
steadily
at
him
for
a
moment
and
then
glanced
at
his
outstretched
hand
the
pleasure
is
mutual
blarst
you
mr
motley
he
said
coldly
and
he
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
the
supercargo
took
a
step
nearer
to
him
with
a
savage
glare
in
his
blue
eyes
what
do
you
mean
by
this
captain
warren
mean
and
the
imperturbable
warren
seated
himself
on
a
corner
of
the
table
and
gazed
stolidly
first
at
the
handsome
motley
and
then
at
the
heavy
vicious
features
of
riedermann
oh
anything
you
like
perhaps
it
because
it
not
pleasant
to
see
white
men
landing
at
a
quiet
island
like
this
with
revolvers
slung
to
their
waists
under
their
pyjamas
looks
a
bit
too
much
like
bully
hayes
style
for
me
and
then
his
tone
of
cool
banter
suddenly
changed
to
that
of
studied
insolence
i
say
motley
i
was
talking
about
you
just
now
to
taplin
and
nerida
do
you
want
to
know
what
i
was
saying
perhaps
i
had
better
tell
you
i
was
talking
about
tita
raymond
and
yourself
motley
put
his
right
hand
under
his
pyjama
jacket
but
taplin
sprang
forward
seized
his
wrist
in
a
grip
of
iron
and
drew
him
aside
the
man
who
draws
a
pistol
in
my
house
mr
motley
does
a
foolish
thing
he
said
in
quiet
contemptuous
tones
as
he
threw
the
supercargo
revolver
into
a
corner
with
set
teeth
and
clenched
hands
motley
flung
himself
into
a
chair
unable
to
speak
warren
still
seated
on
the
table
swung
his
foot
nonchalantly
to
and
fro
and
then
began
at
riedermann
why
how
this
captain
riedermann
do
you
back
up
your
supercargo
little
quarrels
or
have
you
left
your
pistol
on
board
ah
no
you
have
i
can
see
it
there
right
enough
modesty
forbids
you
putting
a
bullet
into
a
man
in
the
presence
of
a
lady
eh
then
slewing
round
again
he
addressed
motley
by
god
sir
it
is
well
for
you
that
we
are
in
a
white
man
house
and
that
that
man
is
my
friend
and
took
away
that
pistol
from
your
treacherous
hand
if
you
had
fired
at
me
i
would
have
booted
you
from
one
end
of
funafuti
beach
to
the
other
and
i
a
damned
good
mind
to
do
it
now
but
wo
as
taplin
has
to
do
some
business
with
you
that
will
do
warren
i
said
we
do
want
to
make
a
scene
in
taplin
house
let
us
go
away
and
allow
him
to
finish
his
business
still
glaring
angrily
at
riedermann
and
motley
warren
got
down
slowly
from
the
table
then
we
bade
taplin
and
nerida
and
went
aboard
at
daylight
we
saw
taplin
and
his
wife
go
off
in
the
alida
boat
they
waved
their
hands
to
us
in
farewell
as
the
boat
pulled
past
the
brig
and
then
the
schooner
anchor
and
with
all
sail
set
stood
away
down
to
the
passage
of
the
lagoon
a
year
or
so
afterward
we
were
on
a
trading
voyage
to
the
islands
of
the
tubuai
group
and
were
lying
becalmed
in
company
with
a
new
bedford
whaler
her
skipper
came
on
board
the
brig
and
we
started
talking
of
taplin
whom
the
captain
knew
did
you
hear
he
said
the
alida
never
showed
up
again
turtle
i
suppose
somewhere
in
the
islands
like
all
those
slashing
schooners
do
sooner
or
later
poor
taplin
said
warren
i
thought
somehow
we
would
never
see
him
again
five
years
had
passed
honest
old
warren
and
had
long
since
died
of
fever
in
the
solomons
and
i
was
supercargo
with
a
smart
young
american
skipper
in
the
brigantine
palestine
when
we
one
day
sailed
along
the
of
a
tiny
little
atoll
in
the
caroline
islands
the
palestine
was
leaking
and
packenham
tempted
by
the
easy
passage
into
the
beautiful
lagoon
decided
to
run
inside
and
discharge
our
cargo
of
copra
to
get
at
the
leak
the
island
had
but
very
few
inhabitants
perhaps
ten
or
twelve
men
and
double
that
number
of
women
and
children
no
ship
they
told
us
had
ever
entered
the
lagoon
but
bully
hayes
brig
and
that
was
nine
years
before
there
was
nothing
on
the
island
to
tempt
a
trading
vessel
and
even
the
sperm
whalers
as
they
lumbered
lazily
past
from
island
to
guam
would
not
bother
to
lower
a
boat
and
dicker
for
or
turtle
at
the
time
of
hayes
visit
the
people
were
in
sore
straits
and
on
the
brink
of
actual
starvation
for
although
there
were
fish
and
turtle
in
plenty
they
had
not
the
strength
to
catch
them
a
few
months
before
a
cyclone
had
destroyed
nearly
all
the
coconut
trees
and
an
epidemic
followed
it
and
carried
off
half
the
scanty
population
the
jaunty
than
whom
a
man
to
natives
never
sailed
the
south
seas
took
pity
on
the
survivors
especially
the
youngest
and
prettiest
girls
and
gave
them
a
passage
in
the
famous
leonora
to
another
island
where
food
was
plentiful
there
they
remained
for
some
years
till
the
inevitable
mal
du
pays
that
is
inborn
to
every
polynesian
and
micronesian
became
too
strong
to
be
resisted
and
so
one
day
a
wandering
sperm
whaler
brought
them
back
again
but
in
their
absence
strangers
had
come
to
the
island
as
the
people
landed
from
the
boats
of
the
two
brown
men
a
woman
and
a
child
came
out
of
one
of
the
houses
and
gazed
at
them
then
they
fled
to
the
farthest
end
of
the
island
and
hid
some
weeks
passed
before
the
returned
islanders
found
out
the
retreat
of
the
strangers
who
were
armed
with
rifles
and
called
them
to
come
out
and
be
friends
they
did
so
and
by
some
subtle
treachery
the
two
men
were
killed
during
the
night
the
woman
who
was
young
and
handsome
was
spared
and
from
what
we
could
learn
had
been
well
treated
ever
since
where
did
the
strangers
come
from
we
asked
that
they
could
not
tell
us
but
the
woman
had
since
told
them
that
the
ship
had
anchored
in
the
lagoon
because
she
was
leaking
badly
and
that
the
captain
and
crew
were
trying
to
stop
the
leak
when
she
began
to
heel
over
and
they
had
barely
time
to
save
a
few
things
when
she
sank
in
a
few
days
the
captain
and
crew
left
the
island
in
the
boat
and
rather
than
face
the
dangers
of
a
long
voyage
in
such
a
small
boat
the
two
natives
and
the
woman
elected
to
remain
on
the
island
that
a
mighty
fishy
yarn
said
packenham
to
me
i
daresay
these
fellows
have
been
doing
a
little
business
but
then
i
know
of
any
missing
vessel
we
go
ashore
and
have
a
look
round
a
little
after
sunset
the
skipper
and
i
were
leaning
over
the
rail
watching
the
figures
of
the
natives
as
they
moved
to
and
fro
in
the
glare
of
the
fires
lighted
here
and
there
along
the
beach
hallo
said
packenham
here
a
canoe
coming
with
only
a
woman
in
it
by
thunder
she
travelling
too
and
coming
straight
for
the
ship
a
few
minutes
more
and
the
canoe
was
alongside
the
woman
hastily
picked
up
a
little
girl
that
was
sitting
in
the
bottom
looked
up
and
called
out
in
english
take
my
little
girl
please
a
native
sailor
leant
over
the
bulwarks
and
lifted
up
the
child
and
the
woman
clambered
after
her
then
seizing
the
child
from
the
sailor
she
flew
along
the
deck
and
into
the
cabin
she
was
standing
facing
us
as
we
followed
and
entered
holding
the
child
tightly
to
her
bosom
the
soft
light
of
the
cabin
lamp
fell
full
upon
her
features
and
we
saw
that
she
was
very
young
and
seemed
wildly
excited
who
are
you
we
said
when
she
advanced
put
out
a
trembling
hand
to
us
and
said
do
you
know
me
mr
supercargo
i
am
nerida
wife
then
she
sank
on
a
seat
and
sobbed
violently
we
waited
till
she
regained
her
composure
somewhat
and
then
i
said
nerida
where
is
taplin
dead
she
said
in
a
voice
scarce
above
a
whisper
only
us
two
are
left
i
and
little
teresa
packenham
held
out
his
hands
to
the
child
with
wondering
timid
eyes
she
came
and
for
a
moment
or
two
looked
doubtingly
upwards
into
the
brown
handsome
face
of
the
skipper
and
then
nestled
beside
him
for
a
minute
or
so
the
ticking
of
the
cabin
clock
broke
the
silence
ere
i
ventured
to
ask
the
one
question
uppermost
in
my
mind
nerida
how
and
where
did
taplin
die
my
husband
was
murdered
at
sea
she
said
and
then
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
do
ask
her
any
more
now
said
packenham
pityingly
let
her
tell
us
she
raised
her
face
yes
i
will
tell
you
you
will
take
me
away
with
you
will
you
not
gentlemen
for
my
child
sake
of
course
said
the
captain
promptly
and
he
stretched
out
his
honest
hand
to
her
she
a
wonderfully
pretty
woman
said
packenham
as
we
walked
the
poop
later
on
and
he
glanced
down
through
the
open
skylight
to
where
she
and
the
child
slept
peacefully
on
the
cushioned
transoms
how
prettily
she
speaks
english
too
do
you
think
she
was
fond
of
her
husband
or
was
it
merely
excitement
that
made
her
cry
native
women
are
as
prone
to
be
as
hysterical
as
our
own
when
under
any
violent
emotion
i
can
only
tell
you
packenham
that
when
i
saw
her
last
five
years
ago
she
was
a
graceful
girl
of
eighteen
and
as
full
of
happiness
as
a
bird
is
of
song
she
looks
thirty
now
and
her
face
is
thin
and
drawn
but
i
do
say
all
for
love
of
taplin
that
will
all
wear
off
by
and
by
said
the
skipper
confidently
yes
i
thought
and
she
wo
be
a
widow
long
next
morning
nerida
had
an
hour
or
two
among
the
prints
and
muslin
in
the
and
there
was
something
of
the
old
beauty
about
her
when
she
sat
down
to
breakfast
with
us
we
were
to
sail
at
noon
the
leak
had
been
stopped
and
packenham
was
in
high
nerida
i
inquired
unthinkingly
do
you
know
what
became
of
the
alida
she
never
turned
up
again
yes
she
answered
she
is
here
at
the
bottom
of
the
lagoon
will
you
come
and
look
at
her
after
breakfast
we
lowered
the
dingy
the
captain
and
i
pulling
nerida
steered
us
out
to
the
north
end
of
the
lagoon
till
we
reached
a
spot
where
the
water
suddenly
deepened
it
was
in
fact
a
deep
pool
some
three
or
four
hundred
feet
in
diameter
closed
in
by
a
continuous
wall
of
coral
rock
the
top
of
which
even
at
low
water
would
be
perhaps
two
or
three
fathoms
under
the
surface
she
held
up
her
hands
for
us
to
back
water
then
she
gazed
over
the
side
into
the
water
look
she
said
there
lies
the
alida
we
bent
over
the
side
of
the
boat
the
waters
of
the
lagoon
were
as
smooth
as
glass
and
as
clear
we
saw
two
slender
rounded
columns
that
seemed
to
shoot
up
in
a
slanting
direction
from
out
the
vague
blue
depths
beneath
to
within
four
or
five
fathoms
of
the
surface
of
the
water
swarms
of
fish
swam
and
circled
in
and
about
the
masses
of
scarlet
and
golden
weed
that
clothed
the
columns
from
their
tops
downward
and
swayed
gently
to
and
fro
as
they
glided
in
and
out
a
turtle
huge
black
and
misshapen
slid
out
from
beneath
the
dark
ledge
of
the
reef
and
swam
slowly
across
the
pool
and
then
between
the
masts
sank
to
the
bottom
was
six
years
ago
said
nerida
as
we
raised
our
heads
that
night
as
the
palestine
sped
noiselessly
before
the
trade
wind
to
the
westward
she
told
me
in
the
old
funafuti
tongue
the
tragedy
of
the
alida
the
schooner
she
said
sailed
very
quickly
for
on
the
fifteenth
day
out
from
funafuti
we
saw
the
peaks
of
strong
island
i
was
glad
for
kusaie
is
not
many
days
sail
from
ponape
and
i
hated
to
be
on
the
ship
the
man
with
the
blue
eyes
filled
me
with
fear
when
he
looked
at
me
and
he
and
the
captain
and
mate
were
for
ever
talking
amongst
themselves
in
whispers
there
were
five
native
sailors
on
board
two
were
countrymen
of
mine
and
three
were
tafitos
natives
of
the
gilbert
islands
one
night
we
were
close
to
a
little
island
called
mokil
island
and
taplin
and
i
were
awakened
by
a
loud
cry
on
deck
my
two
countrymen
were
calling
on
him
to
help
them
he
sprang
on
deck
pistol
in
hand
and
behold
the
schooner
was
laid
to
the
wind
with
the
land
close
to
and
the
boat
alongside
and
the
three
white
men
were
binding
my
with
ropes
because
they
would
not
get
into
the
boat
us
o
friend
they
called
to
my
husband
in
their
own
tongue
white
men
say
that
if
we
go
not
ashore
here
at
mokil
they
will
kill
us
help
us
for
they
mean
evil
to
thee
and
nerida
he
with
the
yellow
moustache
wants
her
for
his
wife
there
were
quick
fierce
words
and
then
my
husband
struck
motley
on
the
head
with
his
pistol
and
felled
him
and
then
pointed
it
at
the
mate
and
the
captain
and
made
them
untie
the
men
and
called
to
the
two
tafito
sailors
who
were
in
the
boat
to
let
her
tow
astern
till
morning
his
face
was
white
with
the
rage
that
burned
in
him
and
all
that
night
he
walked
to
and
fro
and
let
me
sleep
on
the
deck
near
him
he
said
will
make
this
captain
land
us
on
mokil
it
was
for
that
he
would
not
let
the
sailors
come
up
from
the
boat
at
dawn
i
slept
soundly
then
i
awoke
with
a
cry
of
fear
for
i
heard
a
shot
and
then
a
groan
and
my
husband
fell
across
me
and
the
blood
poured
out
of
his
mouth
and
ran
down
my
arms
and
neck
i
struggled
to
rise
and
he
tried
to
draw
his
pistol
but
the
man
with
yellow
hair
and
blue
eyes
who
stood
over
him
stabbed
him
twice
in
the
back
then
the
captain
and
mate
seized
him
by
the
arms
and
lifted
him
up
as
his
head
fell
back
i
saw
there
was
blood
streaming
from
a
hole
in
his
chest
she
ceased
and
leant
her
cheek
against
the
face
of
the
little
girl
who
looked
in
childish
wonder
at
the
tears
that
streamed
down
her
mother
face
they
cast
him
over
into
the
sea
with
life
yet
in
him
and
ere
he
sank
motley
that
devil
with
the
blue
eyes
stood
with
one
foot
on
the
rail
and
fired
another
shot
and
laughed
when
he
saw
the
bullet
strike
then
he
and
the
other
two
talked
us
finish
these
pelew
men
ere
mischief
come
of
it
said
riedermann
the
captain
but
the
others
dissuaded
him
there
was
time
enough
they
said
to
kill
them
and
if
they
killed
them
now
there
would
be
but
three
sailors
to
work
the
ship
and
motley
looked
at
me
and
laughed
and
said
he
for
one
would
do
no
sailor
work
yet
awhile
then
they
all
trooped
below
and
took
me
with
them
me
with
my
husband
blood
not
yet
dried
on
my
hands
and
bosom
they
made
me
get
liquor
for
them
to
drink
and
they
drank
and
laughed
and
motley
put
his
bloodied
hand
around
my
waist
and
kissed
me
and
the
others
laughed
still
more
in
a
little
while
riedermann
and
the
mate
were
so
drunken
that
no
words
came
from
them
and
they
fell
on
the
cabin
floor
then
motley
who
could
stand
but
staggered
as
he
walked
came
and
sat
beside
me
and
kissed
me
again
and
said
he
had
always
loved
me
but
i
pointed
to
the
blood
of
my
husband
that
stained
my
skin
and
clotted
my
hair
together
and
besought
him
to
first
let
me
wash
it
away
it
there
he
said
and
pointed
to
his
cabin
said
i
my
hair
let
me
then
go
on
deck
and
i
can
pour
water
over
my
head
but
he
held
my
hand
tightly
as
we
came
up
and
my
heart
died
within
me
for
it
was
in
my
mind
to
spring
overboard
and
follow
my
husband
he
called
to
one
of
the
tafito
men
to
bring
water
but
none
came
for
they
too
were
drunken
with
liquor
they
had
stolen
from
the
hold
where
there
was
plenty
in
red
cases
and
white
cases
gin
and
brandy
but
my
two
countrymen
were
sober
one
of
them
steered
the
ship
and
the
other
stood
beside
him
with
an
axe
in
his
hand
for
they
feared
the
tafito
men
who
are
devils
when
they
drink
grog
some
water
said
motley
to
juan
he
who
held
the
axe
and
as
he
brought
it
he
said
is
it
tattooed
dog
that
thou
art
so
slow
to
move
and
he
struck
him
in
the
teeth
and
as
he
struck
he
fell
ah
that
was
my
time
ere
he
could
rise
i
sprang
at
him
and
juan
raised
the
axe
and
struck
off
his
right
foot
and
then
liro
the
man
who
steered
handed
me
his
knife
it
was
a
sharp
knife
and
i
stabbed
him
even
as
he
had
stabbed
my
husband
till
my
arm
was
tired
and
all
my
hate
of
him
had
died
away
in
my
heart
there
was
quick
work
then
my
two
countrymen
went
below
into
the
cabin
and
took
motley
pistol
from
the
table
then
i
heard
two
shots
guk
he
was
a
fat
heavy
man
that
riedermann
the
captain
the
three
of
us
could
scarce
drag
him
up
on
deck
and
cast
him
over
the
side
with
the
other
two
then
juan
and
liro
talked
and
said
for
these
tafito
men
they
too
must
die
they
brought
up
rifles
and
went
to
the
forepart
of
the
schooner
where
the
tafito
men
lay
in
a
drunken
sleep
and
shot
them
dead
in
two
more
days
we
saw
land
the
island
we
have
left
but
now
and
because
that
there
were
no
people
living
there
only
empty
houses
could
we
see
juan
and
liro
sailed
the
schooner
into
the
lagoon
we
took
such
things
on
shore
as
we
needed
and
then
juan
and
liro
cut
away
the
topmasts
and
towed
the
schooner
to
the
deep
pool
where
they
made
holes
in
her
so
that
she
sank
away
out
of
the
sight
of
men
juan
and
liro
were
kind
to
me
and
when
my
child
was
born
five
months
after
we
landed
they
cared
for
me
tenderly
so
that
i
soon
became
strong
and
well
only
two
ships
did
we
ever
see
but
they
passed
like
clouds
upon
the
and
we
thought
to
live
and
die
there
by
ourselves
then
there
came
a
ship
bringing
back
the
people
who
had
once
lived
there
they
killed
juan
and
liro
but
let
me
and
the
child
live
the
rest
i
have
told
you
how
is
this
captain
named
he
is
a
handsome
man
and
i
like
him
we
landed
nerida
at
yap
in
the
western
carolines
a
year
afterwards
when
i
left
the
palestine
i
heard
that
packenham
had
given
up
the
sea
was
trading
in
the
pelew
group
and
was
permanently
married
and
that
his
wife
was
the
only
survivor
of
the
alida
the
chilean
bluejacket
a
tale
of
easter
island
alone
in
the
most
solitary
part
of
the
eastern
pacific
midway
between
the
littoral
of
chili
and
peru
and
the
thousand
islets
of
the
low
archipelago
lies
an
island
of
the
days
when
the
world
was
young
by
the
descendants
of
the
forgotten
and
mysterious
race
that
once
quickened
the
land
this
lonely
outlier
of
the
isles
of
the
southern
seas
is
called
in
their
soft
tongue
rapanui
or
the
great
rapa
a
hundred
and
seventy
years
ago
roggewein
on
the
dawn
of
an
easter
sunday
discerned
through
the
misty
tropic
haze
the
grey
outlines
of
an
island
under
his
lee
beam
and
sailed
down
upon
it
he
landed
and
even
as
the
grim
and
hardy
old
navigator
gazed
upon
and
wondered
at
the
mysteries
of
the
strange
island
so
this
day
do
the
cunning
men
of
science
who
perhaps
once
in
thirty
years
go
thither
in
the
vain
effort
to
read
the
secret
of
an
race
and
they
can
tell
us
but
vaguely
that
the
stupendous
existing
evidences
of
past
glories
are
of
immense
and
untold
age
and
show
their
designers
to
have
been
coeval
with
the
builders
of
the
buried
cities
of
mexico
and
peru
beyond
that
they
can
tell
us
nothing
who
can
solve
the
problem
what
manner
of
an
island
king
was
he
who
ruled
the
builders
of
the
great
terraced
platforms
of
stone
the
carvers
of
the
huge
blocks
of
lava
the
with
rudest
tools
of
the
images
of
trachyte
whose
square
massive
and
disdainful
faces
have
for
unnumbered
centuries
gazed
upwards
and
outwards
over
the
rolling
sailless
swell
of
the
and
the
people
of
of
you
may
ask
search
the
whole
pacific
from
pylstaart
the
southern
sentinel
of
the
friendlies
to
the
pelews
thence
eastward
through
the
coral
atolls
of
the
carolines
and
marshalls
and
southwards
to
the
marquesas
and
the
sandy
stretches
of
the
paumotu
and
you
will
find
no
handsomer
men
or
more
graceful
women
than
the
people
of
yet
are
they
but
the
survivors
of
a
race
doomed
doomed
from
the
day
that
roggewein
in
his
clumsy
frigate
first
saw
their
land
and
marvelled
at
the
imperishable
relics
of
a
dead
greatness
with
smiling
faces
they
welcomed
him
a
stranger
from
an
unknown
outside
world
with
cutlass
at
waist
and
pistol
in
hand
as
a
god
he
left
them
a
legacy
of
civilisation
a
hideous
and
cruel
disease
that
swept
through
the
amiable
and
unsuspicious
race
as
an
epidemic
and
slew
its
thousands
and
scaled
with
the
hand
of
death
and
silence
the
eager
life
that
had
then
filled
the
square
houses
of
lava
in
many
a
town
from
the
cliffs
of
terano
kau
to
ounipu
in
the
west
ask
of
the
people
now
whence
came
ye
and
whose
were
the
hands
that
fashioned
these
mighty
images
and
carved
upon
these
stones
and
in
their
simple
manner
they
will
answer
from
rapa
under
the
setting
sun
came
our
fathers
and
we
were
then
a
great
people
even
as
the
oneone
sand
of
the
beach
our
great
king
was
it
he
whose
name
is
forgotten
by
us
that
caused
these
temples
and
cemeteries
and
terraces
to
be
built
and
it
was
in
his
time
that
the
forgotten
fathers
of
our
fathers
carved
from
out
of
the
stone
of
the
quarries
of
terano
kau
the
great
silent
faces
that
gaze
for
ever
upward
to
the
sky
but
it
was
long
ago
ah
a
great
people
were
we
then
in
those
days
and
the
wild
people
to
the
west
called
us
te
tagata
te
pito
henua
the
people
who
live
at
the
end
of
the
world
and
we
know
no
more
and
here
the
knowledge
and
traditions
of
a
broken
people
begin
and
end
i
a
soft
cool
morning
in
november
between
ducie
and
pitcairn
islands
two
american
cruise
lazily
along
to
the
gentle
breath
of
the
trades
when
the
from
both
vessels
see
a
third
sail
bearing
down
upon
them
in
a
few
hours
she
is
close
enough
to
be
recognised
as
one
of
the
luckiest
sperm
whalers
of
the
fleet
the
brig
pocahontas
of
martha
vineyard
within
a
quarter
of
mile
of
the
two
ships
the
nassau
and
the
dagget
the
newcomer
backs
her
foreyard
and
hauls
up
her
mainsail
a
cheer
rises
from
the
ships
she
wants
to
gam
to
gossip
with
eager
hands
four
boats
are
lowered
from
the
two
ships
and
the
captains
and
second
mates
of
each
are
soon
racing
for
the
pocahontas
the
skipper
of
the
brig
after
shaking
hands
with
his
visitors
and
making
the
usual
inquiries
as
to
their
luck
number
of
days
out
from
new
bedford
led
the
way
to
his
cabin
and
calling
his
portuguese
steward
had
liquor
and
a
box
of
cigars
brought
out
the
captain
of
the
pocahontas
was
a
little
old
man
with
sharp
eyes
of
brightest
blue
and
had
the
reputation
of
possessing
the
most
fiery
and
excitable
temper
of
any
of
the
captains
of
the
sixty
or
seventy
american
that
in
those
days
cruised
the
pacific
from
the
west
coast
of
south
america
to
gaum
in
the
ladrones
after
drinking
some
of
his
potent
new
england
rum
with
his
visitors
and
having
answered
all
their
queries
the
master
of
the
pocahontas
inquired
if
they
had
seen
anything
of
a
chilian
further
to
the
eastward
no
they
had
not
then
just
settle
down
gentlemen
for
awhile
and
i
tell
you
one
of
the
curiousest
things
that
i
ever
saw
or
heard
of
i
logged
partiklars
of
the
whole
business
and
when
i
get
to
oahu
honolulu
i
mean
to
just
all
i
do
know
to
father
damon
of
the
honolulu
friend
thar
nothing
like
a
newspaper
fur
showin
a
man
up
when
been
up
to
any
onnatural
villainy
and
thinks
no
one
will
ever
know
anything
about
it
so
just
take
hold
and
listen
the
two
captains
nodded
and
he
told
them
this
ten
days
previously
when
close
in
to
barren
and
isolated
the
pocahontas
had
spoken
the
chilian
corvette
bound
from
easter
island
to
valparaiso
the
captain
of
the
corvette
entertained
the
american
master
courteously
and
explained
his
ship
presence
so
far
to
the
eastward
by
stating
that
the
government
had
instructed
him
to
call
at
easter
island
and
pick
up
an
englishman
in
the
chilian
service
who
had
been
sent
there
to
examine
and
report
on
the
colossal
statues
and
mysterious
terraces
of
that
lonely
island
the
englishman
as
commander
gallegos
said
was
a
valued
servant
of
the
republic
and
had
for
some
years
served
in
its
navy
as
a
surgeon
on
board
el
almirante
cochrane
the
he
had
left
valparaiso
in
the
comboy
with
the
intention
of
remaining
three
months
on
the
island
at
the
end
of
that
time
a
war
vessel
was
to
call
and
convey
him
back
to
chili
but
in
less
than
two
months
the
republic
was
in
the
throes
of
a
deadly
struggle
with
peru
here
the
commander
of
the
bowed
to
the
american
captain
and
pointing
to
a
huge
scar
that
traversed
his
bronzed
face
from
temple
to
chin
said
in
which
i
had
the
honour
to
receive
this
and
promotion
and
nearly
two
years
had
elapsed
ere
the
government
had
time
to
think
again
of
the
english
scientist
and
his
mission
peace
restored
the
was
ordered
to
proceed
to
the
island
and
bring
him
back
and
as
the
character
of
the
natives
was
not
well
known
and
it
was
feared
he
might
have
been
killed
commander
gallegos
was
instructed
to
execute
summary
justice
upon
the
people
of
the
island
if
such
was
the
case
but
the
chilian
officer
said
on
reaching
the
island
he
had
found
the
natives
to
be
very
peaceable
and
inoffensive
and
although
much
alarmed
at
the
appearance
of
his
armed
landing
party
from
the
corvette
they
had
given
him
a
letter
from
the
englishman
and
had
satisfied
him
that
dr
francis
had
remained
with
them
for
some
twelve
months
only
and
had
then
left
the
island
in
a
passing
and
commander
gallegos
making
them
suitable
presents
bade
them
and
steamed
away
to
valparaiso
this
was
all
the
polite
little
commander
had
to
say
and
after
a
farewell
glass
of
wine
his
visitor
rose
to
go
when
the
captain
of
the
corvette
casually
inquired
if
the
pocahontas
was
likely
to
call
at
the
island
i
ask
you
he
said
in
his
perfect
english
because
one
of
my
company
deserted
there
you
senor
may
possibly
meet
with
him
there
yet
he
is
of
no
value
and
he
is
no
sailor
and
but
a
lad
he
was
very
ill
most
of
the
time
and
this
was
his
first
voyage
i
took
him
ashore
with
me
in
my
boat
as
he
besought
me
eagerly
to
do
so
and
the
little
devil
ran
away
and
hid
or
was
hidden
by
the
natives
why
did
you
get
him
back
asked
the
captain
of
the
pocahontas
that
was
easy
enough
but
and
the
commander
raised
his
eyebrows
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
of
what
use
he
was
no
use
to
the
corvette
better
for
him
to
stay
there
and
perhaps
recover
than
to
die
on
board
the
and
be
thrown
to
the
blue
sharks
possibly
senor
you
may
find
him
well
and
it
may
suit
you
to
take
him
to
your
good
ship
and
teach
him
the
business
of
catching
the
whale
my
trade
is
to
show
my
crew
how
to
fight
and
such
as
he
are
of
no
value
for
that
then
the
two
captains
bade
each
other
farewell
and
in
another
hour
the
redoubtable
with
a
black
trail
of
smoke
streaming
astern
was
ten
miles
away
on
her
course
to
valparaiso
a
week
after
the
pocahontas
lay
becalmed
close
in
to
the
lee
side
of
and
within
sight
of
the
houses
of
the
principal
village
the
captain
always
ready
to
get
a
green
hand
was
thinking
of
the
chances
of
his
securing
the
chilian
deserter
and
decided
to
lower
a
boat
and
try
taking
four
men
with
him
he
pulled
ashore
and
landed
at
the
village
of
hagaroa
ii
some
sixty
or
seventy
natives
clustered
round
the
boat
as
she
touched
the
shore
with
smiling
faces
and
outstretched
hands
they
surrounded
the
captain
and
pressed
upon
him
their
simple
gifts
of
ripe
bananas
and
fish
baked
in
leaves
begging
him
to
first
eat
a
little
and
then
walk
with
them
to
mataveri
their
largest
village
distant
a
mile
where
preparations
were
being
made
to
welcome
him
formally
the
skipper
nothing
loth
bade
his
crew
not
to
go
too
far
away
in
their
rambles
and
accompanied
by
his
boatsteerer
was
about
to
set
off
with
the
natives
when
he
remembered
the
object
of
his
visit
and
asked
a
big
woman
the
only
native
present
that
could
speak
english
where
is
the
man
you
hid
from
the
there
was
a
dead
silence
and
for
nearly
half
a
minute
no
one
spoke
the
keen
blue
eyes
of
the
american
looked
from
one
face
to
another
inquiringly
and
then
settled
on
the
fat
features
of
varua
the
big
woman
holding
her
hands
palms
upwards
to
the
captain
she
endeavoured
to
speak
and
then
to
his
astonishment
he
saw
that
her
dark
eyes
were
filled
with
tears
and
then
as
if
moved
with
some
sudden
and
sorrowful
emotion
a
number
of
other
women
and
young
girls
murmuring
softly
in
pitying
tones
e
mate
e
mate
dead
dead
came
to
his
side
and
held
their
hands
out
to
him
with
the
same
supplicating
gesture
the
captain
was
puzzled
for
all
his
island
wanderings
and
cruises
he
had
no
knowledge
of
any
polynesian
dialect
and
the
tearful
muteness
of
the
fat
varua
was
still
unbroken
at
last
she
placed
one
hand
on
his
sleeve
and
pointing
with
the
other
said
in
her
gentle
voice
come
and
taking
his
hand
in
hers
she
led
the
way
the
rest
of
the
people
following
in
silence
for
about
half
a
mile
they
walked
behind
the
captain
and
his
boatsteerer
and
the
woman
varua
without
uttering
a
word
presently
varua
stopped
and
called
out
the
name
of
taku
in
a
low
voice
a
fine
handsome
native
partly
clothed
in
european
sailor
dress
stepped
apart
from
the
others
and
came
to
her
turning
to
the
captain
she
said
this
is
taku
the
sailor
he
can
speak
a
little
english
and
much
spanish
i
tell
him
now
to
come
with
us
for
he
has
a
paper
although
not
understanding
the
relevancy
of
her
remark
the
captain
nodded
and
then
with
gentle
insistence
varua
and
the
other
women
urged
him
on
and
they
again
set
out
a
few
minutes
more
and
they
were
at
the
foot
of
one
of
the
and
ancient
papaku
or
cemeteries
on
the
walls
of
which
were
a
number
of
huge
images
carved
from
trachyte
and
representing
the
trunk
of
the
human
body
some
of
the
figures
bore
on
their
heads
crowns
of
red
tufa
and
the
aspect
of
all
was
towards
the
ocean
at
the
foot
of
the
wall
of
the
papaku
were
a
number
of
prone
figures
with
hands
and
arms
sculptured
in
low
relief
the
outspread
fingers
clasping
the
hips
about
a
cable
length
from
the
wall
stood
two
stone
houses
memorials
of
the
olden
time
and
it
was
to
these
that
varua
and
the
two
white
men
attended
now
by
women
only
directed
their
steps
the
strange
unearthly
stillness
of
the
place
the
low
whispers
of
the
women
the
array
of
colossal
figures
with
faces
set
to
the
sea
and
the
unutterable
air
of
sadness
that
enwrapped
the
whole
scene
overawed
even
the
unimaginative
mind
of
the
rough
whaling
captain
and
he
experienced
a
curious
feeling
of
relief
when
his
guide
entered
through
the
open
doorway
the
largest
of
the
two
houses
and
in
a
whisper
bade
him
follow
a
delightful
sense
of
coolness
was
his
first
sensation
on
entering
and
then
with
noiseless
step
the
other
women
followed
and
seated
themselves
on
the
ground
still
clasping
his
hand
varua
led
him
to
the
farther
end
of
the
house
and
pointed
to
a
motionless
figure
that
lay
on
a
couch
of
mats
covered
with
a
large
piece
of
calico
at
each
side
of
the
couch
sat
a
young
native
girl
and
their
dark
luminous
eyes
shining
from
out
the
wealth
of
black
glossy
hair
that
fell
upon
their
bronzed
shoulders
turned
wonderingly
upon
the
stranger
who
had
broken
in
upon
their
watch
motioning
the
girls
aside
varua
released
her
hold
of
the
white
hand
and
drew
the
cloth
from
off
the
figure
and
the
seaman
pitying
glance
fell
upon
the
pale
sweet
features
of
a
young
white
girl
but
for
the
unmistakable
pallid
hue
of
death
he
thought
at
first
that
she
slept
in
the
thin
delicate
hands
crossed
upon
her
bosom
there
was
placed
after
the
manner
of
those
of
her
faith
a
small
metal
crucifix
her
hair
silky
and
jet
black
was
short
like
a
man
and
the
features
which
even
the
coldness
of
death
had
not
robbed
of
their
beauty
showed
the
spanish
blood
that
but
a
few
hours
before
had
coursed
through
her
veins
slowly
the
old
seaman
drew
the
covering
over
the
still
features
and
with
an
unusual
emotion
stirring
his
rude
nature
he
rose
and
followed
by
varua
walked
outside
and
sat
upon
a
broken
pillar
of
lava
that
lay
under
the
wall
of
the
papaku
calling
his
boatsteerer
he
ordered
him
to
return
to
the
beach
and
go
off
to
the
ship
with
instructions
to
the
mate
to
have
a
coffin
made
as
quickly
as
possible
and
send
it
ashore
and
then
at
a
glance
from
varua
who
smiled
a
grave
approval
as
she
listened
to
his
orders
he
followed
her
and
the
man
she
called
taku
into
the
smaller
of
the
two
houses
round
about
the
inside
walls
of
this
ancient
dwelling
of
a
forgotten
race
were
placed
a
number
of
seamen
chests
made
of
cedar
and
camphor
wood
the
lares
and
penates
of
most
polynesian
houses
the
gravelled
floor
was
covered
with
mats
of
fala
the
seating
herself
with
taku
the
sailor
on
the
mats
varua
motioned
the
captain
to
one
of
the
boxes
and
then
told
him
a
tale
that
moved
him
rough
fierce
and
tyrannical
as
was
his
nature
to
the
deepest
pity
iii
it
is
not
yet
twenty
days
since
the
fighting
pahi
afi
steamer
came
here
and
we
of
mataveri
saw
the
boat
full
of
armed
men
land
on
the
beach
at
hagaroa
filled
with
fear
were
we
but
yet
as
we
had
done
no
wrong
we
stood
on
the
beach
to
welcome
and
ere
the
armed
men
had
left
the
boat
we
knew
them
to
be
the
sipaniola
from
chili
the
same
as
those
that
came
here
ten
years
ago
in
three
ships
and
seized
and
bound
three
hundred
and
six
of
our
men
and
carried
them
away
for
slaves
to
the
land
of
the
tae
manu
and
of
whom
none
but
four
ever
returned
to
and
then
we
trembled
again
she
spoke
of
the
cruel
outrage
of
when
three
peruvian
took
away
over
three
hundred
islanders
to
perish
on
the
of
the
chincha
islands
the
chief
of
the
ship
was
a
little
man
and
he
called
out
to
us
in
the
tongue
of
chili
no
fear
and
took
a
little
gun
from
out
its
case
of
skin
that
hung
by
his
side
and
giving
it
to
a
man
in
the
boat
stepped
over
to
us
and
took
our
hands
in
his
there
none
among
ye
that
speak
my
tongue
he
said
quickly
now
this
man
here
taku
the
sailor
speaketh
the
tongue
of
chili
but
he
feared
to
tell
it
lest
they
might
take
him
away
for
a
sailor
so
he
held
his
lips
tight
then
i
who
for
six
years
dwelt
with
english
people
at
tahiti
was
pushed
forward
by
those
behind
me
and
made
to
talk
in
english
and
lo
the
little
man
spoke
in
your
tongue
even
as
quick
as
he
did
in
that
of
chili
and
then
he
told
us
that
he
came
for
farani
frank
now
this
farani
was
a
young
white
man
of
peretania
england
big
and
strong
he
came
to
us
a
year
and
a
half
ago
he
was
rich
and
had
with
him
chests
filled
with
presents
for
us
of
and
he
told
us
that
he
came
to
live
a
while
among
us
and
look
upon
the
houses
of
stone
and
the
faces
of
the
silent
that
gaze
out
upon
the
sea
for
a
year
he
dwelt
with
us
and
became
as
one
of
ourselves
and
we
loved
him
and
then
because
no
ship
came
he
began
to
weary
and
be
sad
at
last
a
ship
like
thine
one
that
hunts
for
the
whale
came
and
farani
called
us
together
and
placed
a
letter
in
the
hands
of
the
chief
at
mataveri
and
said
it
so
be
that
a
ship
cometh
from
chili
give
these
my
words
to
the
captain
and
all
will
be
well
then
he
bade
us
farewell
and
was
gone
all
this
i
said
in
quick
words
and
then
we
gave
to
the
little
fighting
chief
the
letter
farani
had
written
when
he
had
counted
the
words
in
the
letter
he
said
it
is
well
and
called
to
his
men
and
they
brought
out
many
gifts
for
us
from
the
boat
cloth
and
garments
for
men
and
women
and
two
great
bags
of
canvas
filled
with
tobacco
many
presents
he
gave
us
this
because
of
the
good
words
farani
had
set
down
in
the
letter
then
the
little
chief
said
to
me
these
my
men
walk
where
they
list
and
i
will
go
with
thee
to
mataveri
and
talk
with
the
chief
so
the
sailors
came
out
of
the
boats
carrying
their
guns
and
swords
in
their
hands
but
the
little
chief
whose
avagutu
moustache
stuck
out
on
each
side
of
his
face
like
the
wings
of
a
when
it
leaps
in
terror
from
the
mouth
of
the
hungry
bonito
spoke
angrily
and
they
laid
their
guns
and
swords
back
in
the
boats
so
the
sailors
went
hither
and
thither
with
our
young
men
and
girls
and
although
at
that
time
i
knew
it
not
she
who
now
is
not
was
one
of
them
and
walked
alone
then
i
and
taku
the
sailor
and
the
little
came
to
the
houses
of
mataveri
and
he
stayed
awhile
and
spoke
good
words
to
us
and
we
although
we
fear
the
men
of
chili
for
the
wrong
they
once
did
us
were
yet
glad
to
listen
for
we
also
are
of
their
faith
as
we
talked
there
came
inside
the
house
a
young
girl
named
temeteri
whom
when
farani
had
been
with
us
for
two
months
he
had
taken
for
wife
and
she
bore
him
a
son
but
from
the
day
that
he
had
sailed
away
she
became
sick
with
grief
and
when
after
many
months
she
told
me
that
farani
had
said
he
would
return
to
her
my
heart
was
heavy
for
i
know
the
ways
of
white
men
with
us
women
of
brown
skins
yet
i
feared
to
tell
her
he
lied
and
would
return
no
more
now
this
girl
temeteri
was
sought
after
by
a
man
named
huarani
the
son
of
heremai
who
desired
to
marry
her
now
that
farani
had
gone
and
he
urged
her
to
question
the
chief
of
the
fighting
ship
and
ask
him
if
farani
would
return
so
i
spoke
of
temeteri
he
laughed
and
shook
his
head
and
said
farani
the
englishman
will
return
no
more
but
yet
one
so
beautiful
as
she
and
he
pointed
to
temeteri
have
many
lovers
and
know
no
grief
let
her
marry
again
and
forget
him
and
this
is
my
marriage
gift
to
her
and
he
threw
a
big
golden
coin
upon
the
mat
on
which
the
girl
sat
she
took
it
in
her
hand
and
threw
it
far
out
through
the
doorway
with
bitter
words
and
rose
and
went
away
to
her
child
then
the
little
captain
went
back
to
the
boat
and
called
his
men
to
him
and
lo
one
was
gone
ah
he
was
angry
and
a
great
scar
that
ran
down
one
side
of
his
face
grew
red
with
rage
but
soon
he
laughed
and
said
to
us
there
be
one
of
my
people
hidden
away
from
me
yet
he
is
but
a
boy
and
sick
and
i
care
not
to
stay
and
search
for
him
let
him
be
thy
care
so
that
he
wanders
not
away
and
perishes
among
the
broken
lava
he
will
be
in
good
hands
among
the
people
of
with
that
he
bade
us
farewell
and
in
but
a
little
time
the
great
fighting
ship
had
gone
away
towards
the
rising
sun
all
that
day
and
the
next
we
searched
but
found
not
him
who
had
hidden
away
but
in
the
night
of
the
second
day
when
it
rained
heavily
and
taku
who
is
my
brother
son
and
i
and
my
two
children
worked
at
the
making
of
a
kupega
net
he
whom
we
had
sought
came
to
the
door
and
as
we
looked
our
hearts
were
filled
with
pity
for
as
he
put
out
his
hands
to
us
he
staggered
and
fell
to
the
ground
so
taku
who
is
a
man
of
a
good
heart
and
i
lifted
him
up
and
carried
him
to
a
bed
of
soft
mats
and
as
i
placed
my
hand
on
his
bosom
to
see
if
he
was
dead
lo
it
was
soft
as
a
woman
and
i
saw
that
the
stranger
was
a
young
girl
i
took
from
her
the
wet
garments
and
brought
warm
clothes
of
mamoe
blankets
and
taku
made
a
great
fire
and
we
rubbed
her
cold
body
and
her
hands
and
feet
till
her
life
came
back
to
her
again
and
she
sat
up
and
ate
a
little
taro
when
the
night
and
the
dawn
touched
she
slept
again
the
sun
was
high
when
the
white
girl
awoke
and
fear
leapt
into
her
eyes
when
she
saw
the
house
filled
with
people
who
came
to
question
taku
and
me
about
the
stranger
with
them
came
the
girl
temeteri
whose
head
was
still
filled
with
foolish
thoughts
of
farani
her
white
lover
i
went
to
the
strange
girl
put
my
arm
around
her
and
spoke
but
though
she
smiled
and
answered
in
a
little
voice
i
understood
her
not
for
i
know
none
of
the
tongue
of
chili
but
yet
she
leaned
her
head
against
my
bosom
and
her
eyes
that
were
as
big
and
bright
as
fetuaho
the
star
of
the
morning
looked
up
into
mine
and
smiled
through
their
tears
there
was
a
creat
buzzing
of
talk
among
the
women
some
came
to
her
and
touched
her
hands
and
forehead
and
said
thy
trembling
cease
we
of
will
be
kind
to
the
white
girl
and
as
the
people
thronged
about
her
and
talked
she
shook
her
head
and
her
eyes
sought
mine
and
hot
tears
splashed
upon
my
hand
then
the
mother
of
temeteri
raised
her
voice
and
called
to
taku
the
sailor
and
said
taku
thou
who
knowest
her
tongue
ask
her
of
farani
my
white
son
the
husband
of
my
daughter
the
young
girls
in
the
house
laughed
scornfully
at
old
pohere
for
some
of
them
had
loved
farani
who
yet
had
put
them
all
aside
for
temeteri
whose
beauty
exceeded
theirs
and
so
they
hated
her
and
laughed
at
her
mother
then
taku
being
pressed
by
old
pohere
spoke
in
the
tongue
of
chili
but
not
of
temeteri
ah
she
sprang
to
her
feet
and
talked
then
and
the
flying
words
chased
one
another
from
her
lips
and
these
things
told
she
to
taku
she
had
hidden
among
the
broken
lava
and
watched
the
little
captain
come
back
to
the
boat
and
bid
us
farewell
then
when
night
came
she
had
crept
out
and
gone
far
over
to
the
great
papaku
and
lay
down
to
hide
again
for
she
feared
the
fighting
ship
might
return
to
seek
her
and
all
that
day
she
lay
hidden
in
the
lava
till
night
fell
upon
her
again
and
hunger
drove
her
to
seek
the
faces
of
men
in
the
rain
she
all
but
perished
till
god
brought
her
feet
to
this
my
house
then
said
taku
the
sailor
didst
thou
flee
from
the
ship
the
white
girl
put
her
hands
to
her
face
and
wept
and
said
me
my
jacket
i
gave
to
her
the
blue
sailor
jacket
and
from
inside
of
it
she
took
a
little
flat
thing
and
placed
it
in
her
bosom
again
said
old
pohere
to
taku
man
of
slow
tongue
ask
her
of
farani
so
he
asked
in
this
wise
o
white
girl
that
is
pohere
the
mother
of
temeteri
who
bore
a
son
to
the
white
man
that
came
here
to
look
upon
the
silent
faces
and
because
he
came
from
thy
land
and
because
of
the
heart
of
temeteri
which
is
dried
up
for
love
of
him
does
this
foolish
old
woman
ask
thee
if
thou
hast
seen
him
for
long
months
ago
he
left
in
our
tongue
we
call
him
farani
the
girl
looked
at
taku
the
sailor
and
her
lips
moved
but
no
words
came
then
from
her
bosom
she
took
the
little
flat
thing
and
held
it
to
him
but
sickness
was
in
her
hand
so
that
it
trembled
and
that
which
she
held
fell
to
the
ground
so
taku
stooped
and
picked
it
up
from
where
it
lay
on
the
mat
and
looked
and
his
eyes
blazed
and
he
shouted
out
for
it
was
the
face
of
farani
that
looked
into
his
and
as
he
held
it
up
in
his
hand
to
the
people
they
too
shouted
in
wonder
and
then
the
girl
temeteri
cast
aside
those
that
stood
about
her
and
tore
it
from
his
hand
and
fled
is
she
said
the
white
girl
in
a
weak
voice
to
taku
why
hath
she
robbed
me
of
that
which
is
dear
to
me
and
taku
was
ashamed
and
turned
his
face
away
from
her
because
of
two
things
his
heart
was
sore
for
temeteri
who
is
a
blood
relation
and
was
shamed
because
her
white
lover
had
deserted
her
and
he
was
full
of
pity
for
the
white
girl
tears
so
he
said
nought
the
girl
raised
herself
and
her
hand
caught
taku
by
the
arm
and
these
were
her
words
man
for
the
love
of
jesu
christ
tell
me
what
was
this
woman
temeteri
to
my
husband
now
taku
the
sailor
was
sore
troubled
and
felt
it
hard
to
hurt
her
heart
yet
he
said
farani
the
englishman
thy
husband
she
wept
again
was
my
husband
left
he
one
as
fair
as
thee
said
taku
in
wonder
she
shook
her
head
know
not
except
he
loved
to
look
upon
strange
lands
yet
he
loved
me
is
a
bad
man
said
taku
loved
others
as
well
as
thee
the
girl
that
fled
but
now
with
his
picture
was
wife
to
him
here
he
loved
her
and
she
bore
him
a
son
the
girl
head
fell
on
my
shoulder
and
her
eyes
closed
and
she
became
as
dead
and
lo
in
a
little
while
as
she
strove
to
speak
blood
poured
from
her
mouth
and
ran
down
over
her
bosom
is
the
hand
of
death
said
taku
the
sailor
where
she
now
lies
there
died
she
at
about
the
hour
when
the
people
of
vaihou
saw
the
sails
of
thy
ship
we
have
no
priest
here
for
the
good
father
that
was
here
three
years
ago
is
now
silent
dead
yet
did
taku
and
i
pray
with
her
and
ere
she
died
she
said
she
would
set
down
some
words
on
paper
so
alrema
my
little
daughter
hastened
to
mataveri
and
the
chief
sent
back
some
paper
and
vai
tuhi
ink
that
had
belonged
to
the
good
priest
so
with
weak
hand
she
set
down
some
words
but
even
as
she
wrote
she
rose
up
and
threw
out
her
hands
and
called
out
francisco
and
fell
back
and
was
dead
iv
the
captain
of
the
pocahontas
dashed
the
now
tears
from
his
eyes
and
with
his
rough
old
heart
swelling
with
pity
for
the
poor
wanderer
took
from
taku
the
sheet
of
paper
on
which
the
girl
last
words
were
traced
ere
he
could
read
it
a
low
murmur
of
voices
outside
told
him
his
crew
had
returned
they
carried
a
rude
wooden
shell
and
then
with
bared
heads
the
captain
and
boatsteerer
entered
the
house
where
she
lay
again
the
old
man
raised
the
piece
of
navy
blue
cloth
from
off
the
sweet
sad
face
and
a
heavy
tear
dropped
down
upon
her
forehead
then
aided
by
the
gentle
sympathetic
women
his
task
was
soon
finished
and
two
of
his
crew
entered
and
carried
their
burden
to
its
grave
service
there
was
none
only
the
prayers
and
tears
of
the
brown
women
of
ere
he
said
farewell
the
captain
of
the
placed
money
in
the
hands
of
varua
and
taku
they
drew
back
hurt
and
mortified
seeing
his
mistake
the
seaman
desired
varua
to
give
the
money
to
the
girl
temeteri
nay
sir
said
varua
she
would
but
give
me
bitter
words
even
when
she
who
is
now
silent
was
not
yet
cold
temeteri
came
to
the
door
of
the
house
where
she
lay
and
spat
twice
on
the
ground
and
taking
up
gravel
in
her
hand
cast
it
at
her
and
cursed
her
in
the
name
of
our
old
heathen
gods
and
as
for
money
we
here
in
need
it
not
may
christ
protect
thee
on
the
sea
farewell
the
captain
of
the
pocahontas
rose
and
came
to
the
cabin
table
and
motioning
to
his
guests
to
fill
their
glasses

a
bit
but

some
sorter
trouble
among
the
natives

the
captain
of
the
dagget
i

the
affair

was
mate
of
the
josephine
and
we
were
lying
at
jakoits
harbour
when
he
was
killed
and
now
i
remember
the
name
too
waal
he
was
much
account
anyhow
ten
years
ago
a
wandering
white
man
stood
with
taku
the
sailor
at
the
base
of
the
wall
of
the
great
papaku
and
the
native
pointed
out
the
last
of
the
wanderer
there
under
the
shadow
of
the
silent
faces
of
stone
the
brave
and
loving
heart
that
dared
so
much
is
at
peace
for
ever
brantley
of
vahitahi
one
day
a
trading
vessel
lay
becalmed
off
tatakoto
in
the
paumotu
archipelago
and
the
captain
and
supercargo
taking
a
couple
of
native
sailors
with
them
went
ashore
at
dawn
to
catch
some
turtle
the
turtle
were
plentiful
and
easily
caught
and
after
half
a
dozen
had
been
put
in
the
boat
the
two
white
men
strolled
along
the
white
hard
beach
the
captain
old
grizzled
and
grim
seemed
to
know
the
place
well
and
led
the
way
the
island
is
very
narrow
and
as
they
left
the
beach
and
gained
the
shade
of
the
forest
of
coconuts
that
grew
to
the
margin
of
mark
they
could
see
between
the
tall
stately
palms
the
placid
waters
of
the
lagoon
and
a
mile
or
so
across
the
inner
beach
of
the
weather
side
of
the
island
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile
or
so
the
two
men
walked
on
till
the
widest
part
of
the
island
was
reached
here
under
the
shadow
of
some
giant
puka
trees
the
old
skipper
stopped
and
sat
down
on
a
roughly
hewn
slab
of
coral
the
remains
of
one
of
those
marae
or
heathen
temples
that
are
to
be
found
almost
anywhere
in
the
islands
of
eastern
polynesia
i
knew
this
place
well
once
he
said
as
he
pulled
out
his
pipe
i
used
to
come
here
when
i
was
sailing
one
of
brander
vessels
out
of
tahiti
as
we
have
done
now
we
did
then
came
here
for
turtle
no
natives
have
lived
here
for
the
past
forty
years
did
you
ever
hear
of
brantley
yes
answered
the
supercargo
but
he
died
long
ago
did
he
not
aye
he
died
here
and
his
wife
and
sister
too
they
all
lie
here
in
this
old
marae
and
then
he
told
the
story
of
brantley
i
it
was
six
years
since
brantley
with
his
companions
in
misery
had
drifted
ashore
at
lonely
vahitahi
in
the
paumotu
group
and
the
people
had
gazed
with
pitying
horror
upon
the
dreadful
beings
that
muttering
and
gibbering
to
each
other
lay
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
and
pointed
with
long
fingers
to
their
burnt
and
bloody
lips
and
now
as
he
sits
in
the
doorway
of
his
thatched
house
and
gazes
dreamily
out
upon
the
long
curve
of
creamy
beach
and
line
of
palms
that
fringe
the
leeward
side
of
his
island
home
brantley
passes
a
brown
hand
slowly
up
and
down
his
cheek
and
thinks
of
the
past
he
was
so
full
of
life
of
the
very
joy
of
living
that
time
six
years
ago
when
he
sailed
from
auckland
on
that
fateful
voyage
in
the
doris
it
was
his
first
voyage
as
captain
and
the
ship
was
his
own
and
even
now
he
remembers
with
a
curious
pang
the
last
words
of
his
only
sister
the
doris
after
whom
he
had
called
his
new
ship
as
she
had
kissed
him
farewell
i
am
so
glad
fred
to
hear
them
call
you
brantley
and
the
voyage
the
wild
feverish
desire
to
make
a
record
passage
to
and
back
the
earnest
words
of
poor
old
lutton
the
mate
not
to
carry
on
so
at
night
going
through
the
paumotu
group
that
awful
midnight
crash
when
the
doris
ran
hopelessly
into
the
wild
boil
of
roaring
surf
on
tuanake
reef
the
white
despairing
faces
of
five
of
his
men
who
with
curses
in
their
eyes
upon
his
folly
were
swept
out
of
sight
into
the
awful
blackness
of
the
night
and
then
the
days
in
the
boat
with
the
six
survivors
ah
the
memory
of
that
will
chill
his
blood
to
his
dying
day
men
have
had
to
do
that
which
he
and
the
two
who
came
through
alive
with
him
had
done
how
long
they
endured
that
black
agony
of
suffering
he
knew
not
by
common
consent
none
of
them
ever
spoke
of
it
again
three
months
after
they
had
drifted
ashore
a
passing
sperm
whaler
cruising
through
the
group
took
away
the
two
seamen
and
then
brantley
after
bidding
them
a
silent
farewell
had
with
bitter
despair
gnawing
at
his
heart
turned
his
face
away
from
the
ship
and
walked
back
into
the
village
i
will
never
go
back
again
he
had
said
to
himself
and
perhaps
he
was
right
for
when
the
doris
went
to
pieces
on
tuanake
his
hope
and
fortunes
went
with
her
and
save
for
that
other
doris
there
was
no
one
in
the
world
who
cared
for
him
he
was
not
the
man
to
face
the
world
again
with
why
he
lost
his
first
ship
whispered
among
his
acquaintances
and
this
is
how
brantley
young
handsome
and
as
smart
a
seaman
save
for
that
one
fatal
mistake
as
ever
trod
a
deck
became
paranili
the
papalagi
and
was
living
out
his
life
among
the
people
of
solitary
vahitahi
ere
a
year
had
passed
a
trading
captain
bound
to
the
gambier
islands
had
given
him
a
small
stock
of
trade
goods
and
the
thought
of
doris
had
been
his
salvation
only
for
her
he
would
have
sunk
to
the
life
of
a
mere
idle
and
dissolute
as
it
was
his
steady
straightforward
life
among
the
people
of
the
island
was
a
big
factor
to
his
business
success
and
so
every
year
he
sent
money
to
doris
by
some
passing
whaler
or
tahitian
trading
schooner
but
twice
only
had
he
got
letters
from
her
and
each
time
she
had
said
let
me
come
to
you
fred
we
are
alone
in
the
world
and
may
never
meet
again
else
sometimes
i
awake
in
the
night
with
a
sudden
fear
let
me
come
my
heart
is
breaking
with
the
loneliness
of
my
life
here
so
far
away
from
you
but
two
years
ago
he
had
done
that
which
would
keep
doris
from
ever
coming
to
him
he
thought
he
had
married
a
young
native
girl
that
is
taken
her
to
wife
in
the
paumotuan
fashion
and
surely
doris
with
her
notions
of
right
and
wrong
would
grieve
bitterly
if
she
knew
it
presently
he
rose
talking
to
himself
as
is
the
wont
of
those
who
have
lived
long
apart
from
all
white
associations
and
sauntered
up
and
down
the
shady
path
at
the
side
of
his
dwelling
thinking
of
doris
and
if
he
would
ever
see
her
again
then
he
entered
the
house
seated
on
the
matted
floor
with
her
face
turned
from
him
was
a
young
native
girl
luita
his
wife
she
was
making
a
hat
from
the
bleached
strands
of
the
pandanus
leaf
and
as
she
worked
she
sang
softly
to
herself
in
the
tongue
of
her
people
brantley
lazily
stretching
himself
out
on
a
rough
couch
turned
towards
her
and
watched
the
slender
supple
fingers
covered
in
polynesian
fashion
with
heavy
gold
rings
as
they
deftly
drew
out
the
strands
of
the
pandanus
the
long
glossy
black
waves
of
hair
that
fell
over
her
bare
back
and
bosom
like
a
mantle
of
night
hid
her
face
from
his
view
and
the
man
let
his
glance
rest
in
contented
admiration
upon
the
graceful
curves
of
the
youthful
figure
then
he
sighed
softly
and
again
his
eyes
turned
to
the
wide
sailless
expanse
of
the
pacific
that
lay
shimmering
and
sparkling
before
him
under
a
cloudless
sky
of
blue
and
he
thought
again
of
doris
steadily
the
little
hands
worked
in
and
out
among
the
snowy
strands
and
now
and
then
as
she
came
to
the
tari
or
refrain
of
the
old
paumotuan
her
soft
liquid
tones
would
blend
with
the
quavering
treble
of
children
that
played
outside
terunavahori
teeth
of
pearl
knit
the
sandals
for
talaloo
feet
sandals
of
afa
thick
and
strong
bind
them
well
with
thy
long
black
hair
suddenly
the
song
ceased
and
with
a
quick
movement
of
her
shoulders
she
threw
back
the
cloud
of
hair
that
fell
around
her
arms
and
bosom
looked
up
at
brantley
and
laughed
and
striking
the
mat
on
which
she
sat
with
her
open
palm
said
haere
mai
paranili
he
rose
from
the
couch
and
stooped
beside
her
with
his
hands
resting
on
his
knees
and
bending
his
brow
in
mock
criticism
regarded
her
handiwork
intently
springing
to
her
feet
hat
in
hand
and
placing
her
two
hands
on
his
now
erect
shoulders
she
looked
into
his
face
darker
far
than
her
own
and
said
with
a
smile
behold
paranili
thy
pulou
is
finished
save
for
a
band
of
black
which
thou
shalt
give
me
from
the
store
mine
said
brantley
in
pretended
ignorance
why
labour
so
for
me
are
there
not
hats
in
plenty
on
vahitahi
true
o
thankless
one
but
the
women
of
the
village
say
that
thou
lookest
upon
me
as
a
fool
because
i
can
neither
make
mats
nor
do
many
other
things
such
as
becometh
a
wife
and
for
this
did
merani
my
cousin
teach
me
how
to
make
a
wide
hat
of
fala
to
shield
thy
face
from
the
sun
when
thou
art
out
upon
the
pearling
grounds
my
husband
but
thy
face
and
neck
and
hands
are
as
dark
as
those
of
the
people
of
makatea
they
who
are
for
ever
in
their
canoes
see
paranili
bend
thy
head
thou
art
a
tall
man
my
husband
and
she
trilled
a
happy
rippling
laugh
as
she
placed
the
hat
on
his
head
he
placed
one
hand
around
the
pliant
waist
and
under
the
mantle
of
hair
and
drew
her
towards
him
and
then
moved
by
a
sudden
emotion
kissed
her
soft
red
lips
luita
he
asked
would
it
hurt
thee
if
i
were
to
go
away
the
girl
drew
away
from
him
and
for
the
first
time
in
two
years
brantley
saw
an
angry
flush
tinge
her
cheek
a
dusky
red
ah
the
contemptuous
ring
in
her
voice
made
the
man
eyes
drop
thou
art
like
all
white
men
was
there
ever
one
who
was
faithful
what
other
woman
is
it
that
thou
desirest
is
it
nia
of
ahunui
she
who
when
thy
boat
lay
anchored
in
the
lagoon
swam
off
at
night
and
asked
thee
for
thy
love
the
shameless
nia
the
angry
light
in
the
black
eyes
shone
fiercely
and
the
dull
red
on
her
cheeks
had
changed
to
the
livid
paleness
of
passion
brantley
holding
the
rim
of
the
hat
over
his
mouth
laughed
secretly
pleased
at
her
first
outburst
of
jealousy
then
his
natural
manliness
asserted
itself
come
here
he
said
somewhat
sullenly
the
girl
obeyed
and
edged
up
beside
him
with
face
bent
down
he
put
his
hand
upon
hers
and
for
a
few
seconds
looked
at
the
delicate
tracery
of
tattooing
that
on
the
back
ran
in
thin
blue
lines
from
the
finger
tips
to
the
wrists
what
a
d
d
pity
he
muttered
to
himself
this
infernal
tattooing
would
give
the
poor
devil
away
anywhere
in
civilization
her
skin
is
not
as
dark
as
that
pretty
creole
i
was
so
sweet
on
in
galveston
ten
years
ago
well
she
good
enough
for
a
broken
man
like
me
but
i
ca
take
her
away
that
certain
a
heavy
tear
splashed
on
his
hand
and
then
he
pulled
her
to
him
almost
savagely
see
luita
i
did
but
ask
to
try
thee
have
no
fear
thy
land
is
mine
for
ever
the
girl
looked
up
and
in
an
instant
her
face
wet
with
tears
was
laid
against
his
breast
still
caressing
the
dark
head
that
lay
upon
his
chest
brantley
stooped
and
whispered
something
the
little
tattooed
hand
released
its
clasp
of
his
arm
and
struck
him
a
playful
blow
and
would
that
bind
thee
more
to
me
and
to
the
ways
of
these
our
people
of
vahitahi
she
asked
with
still
buried
face
aye
answered
the
slowly
for
i
have
none
but
thee
in
the
world
to
care
for
she
turned
her
face
up
is
there
none
not
even
one
woman
in
beretania
whose
face
comes
to
thee
in
the
darkness
brantley
shook
his
head
sadly
of
course
there
was
doris
he
thought
but
he
had
never
spoken
of
her
sometimes
when
the
longing
to
see
her
again
would
come
upon
him
he
would
have
talked
of
her
to
his
native
wife
but
he
was
by
nature
an
uncommunicative
man
and
the
thought
of
how
doris
must
feel
her
loneliness
touched
him
with
remorse
and
made
him
silent
another
year
passed
and
matters
had
gone
well
with
brantley
ten
months
before
he
had
dropped
on
one
of
the
best
patches
of
shell
in
the
paumotus
and
as
he
sits
writing
and
smoking
in
the
big
room
of
his
house
he
looks
contentedly
out
through
the
open
door
to
a
little
white
painted
schooner
that
lay
at
anchor
on
the
calm
waters
of
the
lagoon
he
had
just
come
back
from
tahiti
with
her
and
the
two
thousand
dollars
he
had
paid
for
the
vessel
was
an
easy
matter
for
a
man
who
was
now
making
a
thousand
dollars
a
month
what
a
stroke
of
luck
he
writes
to
doris
had
i
gone
back
to
sydney
where
would
i
be
now
a
mate
i
suppose
on
some
ship
earning
twelve
or
fourteen
pounds
a
month
another
year
or
two
like
this
and
i
can
go
back
a
made
man
some
day
my
dear
i
may
but
i
will
come
back
here
again
the
ways
of
the
people
have
become
my
ways
he
laid
down
his
pen
and
came
to
the
door
and
stood
thinking
awhile
and
listening
to
the
gentle
rustle
of
the
palms
as
they
swayed
their
lofty
plumes
to
the
breezy
trade
wind
yes
he
thought
i
would
like
to
go
and
see
doris
but
i
ca
take
luita
and
so
it
can
not
be
how
that
girl
suspects
me
even
now
when
i
went
to
tahiti
to
buy
the
schooner
i
believe
she
thought
she
would
never
see
me
again
what
a
fool
i
am
doris
is
all
right
i
suppose
although
it
is
a
year
since
i
had
a
letter
and
i
could
any
man
want
more
i
do
believe
there
a
soul
on
the
island
but
thinks
as
much
of
me
as
luita
herself
does
and
by
she
a
pearl
even
though
she
is
only
a
native
girl
no
i
stay
here
will
always
be
a
big
man
in
the
paumotus
but
fred
brantley
would
be
nobody
in
sydney
only
a
common
merchant
skipper
who
had
made
money
in
the
islands
and
perhaps
doris
is
married
so
he
thought
and
talked
to
himself
listening
the
while
to
the
soft
symphony
of
the
swaying
and
the
subdued
murmur
of
the
surf
as
the
rollers
crashed
on
the
distant
line
of
reef
away
to
leeward
of
late
these
fleeting
visions
of
the
outside
world
that
quick
busy
world
whose
memories
save
for
those
of
doris
were
all
but
dead
to
him
had
become
more
frequent
but
the
calm
placid
happiness
of
his
existence
and
that
strange
fatal
glamour
that
for
ever
enwraps
the
minds
of
those
who
wander
in
the
islands
of
the
sunlit
sea
as
the
old
spanish
navigators
called
polynesia
had
woven
its
spell
too
strongly
over
his
nature
to
be
broken
and
now
as
the
murmur
of
women
voices
caused
him
to
turn
his
head
to
the
shady
end
of
the
verandah
the
dark
dreamy
eyes
of
luita
who
with
her
women
attendants
sat
there
playing
with
her
child
looked
out
at
him
from
beneath
their
long
lashes
and
told
him
his
captivity
was
complete
a
week
afterwards
the
people
of
vahitahi
were
clustered
on
the
beach
putting
supplies
of
native
food
in
the
schooner
boat
that
night
he
was
to
sail
again
for
the
pearling
grounds
at
matahiva
lagoon
and
would
be
away
three
months
one
by
one
the
people
bade
him
adieu
and
then
stood
apart
while
he
said
farewell
to
luita
e
mahina
tolu
only
three
months
little
one
he
said
why
such
a
gloomy
face
the
girl
shook
her
head
and
her
mouth
twitched
but
the
miti
dream
paranili
the
miti
of
my
mother
she
is
wise
in
the
things
that
are
hidden
for
she
is
one
of
those
who
believe
in
the
old
gods
of
vahitahi
and
there
are
many
here
of
the
new
lotu
faith
christianity
who
yet
believe
in
the
old
gods
and
see
she
has
dreamed
of
this
unknown
evil
to
thee
twice
and
twice
have
the
voices
of
those
who
are
silent
in
the
marae
called
to
me
in
the
night
and
said
must
not
go
he
must
not
go
knowing
well
how
the
old
superstitious
taint
ran
riot
in
the
imaginative
native
mind
brantley
did
not
attempt
to
reason
but
sought
to
gently
disengage
her
hands
from
his
arm
she
dropped
on
the
sand
at
his
feet
and
clasped
his
knees
and
a
long
wailing
note
of
grief
rang
out
aue
aue
my
husband
if
it
so
be
that
thou
dost
not
heed
the
voices
that
call
in
the
night
then
out
of
thy
love
for
me
and
our
child
let
me
come
also
then
if
evil
befall
thee
let
us
perish
together
brantley
raised
his
hand
and
pointed
to
the
bowed
and
weeping
figure
some
women
came
and
lifted
her
up
then
taking
the
tender
face
between
his
rough
hands
he
bent
his
head
to
hers
sprang
into
the
boat
and
was
gone
ii
with
ten
tons
of
shell
snugly
stowed
in
her
hold
the
little
tamariki
was
heading
back
for
vahitahi
after
barely
two
months
absence
brantley
as
he
leant
over
the
rail
and
watched
the
swirl
and
eddy
of
the
creamy
phosphorescence
that
hissed
and
bubbled
under
the
stern
felt
well
satisfied
it
was
the
hour
of
dawn
and
the
native
at
the
tiller
sang
as
the
stars
began
to
pale
before
the
red
flush
that
tinged
the
sky
to
windward
a
low
chant
of
farewell
to
fetuaho
the
star
of
the
morning
and
then
he
called
to
brantley
who
to
all
his
crew
was
always
paranili
and
never
kapeni
captain
and
pointed
with
his
naked
tattooed
arm
away
to
leeward
where
the
low
outlines
of
an
island
began
to
show
look
paranili
that
is
tatakoto
the
place
i
have
told
thee
of
where
the
turtle
makes
the
white
beach
to
look
black
would
it
not
be
well
for
us
to
take
some
home
to
vahitahi
thou
glutton
said
brantley
dost
thou
think
i
am
like
to
lose
a
day
so
that
thou
and
thy
friends
may
fill
thy
stomachs
with
turtle
meat
rua
manu
laughed
and
showed
his
white
even
teeth
nay
paranili
not
for
that
alone
but
it
is
a
great
place
that
tatakoto
and
thou
hast
never
landed
there
to
look
and
luita
hath
said
that
some
day
she
would
ask
thee
to
take
her
there
for
though
she
was
born
at
vahitahi
her
blood
is
that
of
the
people
of
tatakoto
who
have
long
since
lain
silent
in
the
maraes
brantley
had
often
heard
her
speak
of
it
this
solitary
spot
in
the
wide
pacific
and
now
as
he
looked
at
the
pretty
island
against
the
weather
shore
of
which
the
thundering
rollers
burst
with
a
muffled
roar
he
was
surprised
at
its
length
and
extent
and
decided
to
pay
it
a
visit
some
day
not
now
rua
he
said
to
the
steersman
but
it
shall
be
soon
are
there
many
coconuts
there
many
may
i
perish
but
the
trees
are
as
the
sand
of
the
sea
and
the
nuts
lie
thick
upon
the
ground
and
the
robber
crabs
are
in
thousands
and
fat
and
the
eggs
glutton
again
be
content
in
a
little
while
we
and
as
many
of
the
people
of
vahitahi
as
the
schooner
will
carry
will
go
there
and
stay
for
the
turtle
season
three
days
afterwards
the
schooner
was
within
fifty
miles
of
his
island
home
when
brantley
was
aroused
at
daylight
from
his
watch
below
by
the
cry
of
te
pahi
a
ship
and
hastening
on
deck
he
saw
a
large
vessel
bearing
down
upon
them
in
half
an
hour
she
was
close
to
and
brantley
recognised
her
as
a
brig
from
tahiti
that
occasionally
made
a
trading
voyage
to
the
paumotus
and
whose
skipper
was
a
personal
friend
suddenly
she
and
lowered
a
boat
which
came
alongside
the
schooner
and
the
white
man
that
steered
jumped
on
deck
and
held
out
his
hand
how
are
you
brantley
and
then
his
eye
went
quickly
over
the
crew
of
the
schooner
then
glanced
through
the
open
skylight
into
the
little
cabin
and
a
hopeful
expectant
look
in
his
face
died
away
very
well
thank
you
latham
but
what
is
wrong
you
look
worried
come
on
board
said
the
captain
of
the
brig
quietly
and
i
tell
you
as
brantley
took
his
seat
beside
him
latham
said
i
have
bad
news
for
you
brantley
your
sister
is
on
board
the
brig
and
i
fear
she
will
not
live
long
she
came
down
to
tahiti
in
the
marama
from
auckland
and
offered
me
a
good
round
sum
to
bring
her
to
you
has
she
been
ill
long
latham
latham
looked
at
him
curiously
did
you
know
brantley
she
in
a
rapid
consumption
for
a
moment
neither
men
spoke
then
latham
gave
a
short
cough
i
feel
it
almost
as
badly
as
you
brantley
but
i
got
a
bit
more
bad
news
go
on
latham
it
ca
matter
much
my
poor
sister
is
everything
to
me
just
so
that
what
i
told
miss
brantley
well
it
this
your
wife
and
child
are
missing
latham
glanced
at
him
and
saw
that
his
hand
trembled
and
then
grasped
the
gunwale
of
the
boat
we
got
into
vahitahi
lagoon
about
ten
days
ago
and
i
took
miss
brantley
ashore
what
happened
i
do
exactly
know
but
the
next
night
one
of
your
was
gone
and
luita
and
the
child
were
missing
your
sister
was
in
a
terrible
state
of
mind
and
offered
me
a
thousand
dollars
to
put
to
sea
brantley
old
man
i
would
take
a
dollar
from
her
god
bless
her
but
i
did
put
to
sea
and
i
searched
nigh
on
twenty
islands
and
scores
of
reefs
and
sandbanks
thank
you
latham
said
brantley
quietly
when
we
get
on
board
you
can
give
me
further
particulars
of
the
islands
you
searched
you
can
have
my
marked
chart
i
got
a
spare
one
brace
up
old
man
you
see
your
sister
in
a
minute
she
is
terribly
cut
up
over
poor
luita
more
so
than
i
knew
you
would
be
but
she
was
a
grand
little
woman
brantley
although
she
was
only
a
native
yes
he
answered
in
the
same
slow
dazed
manner
she
was
a
good
little
girl
to
me
although
she
the
words
stuck
in
his
throat
latham
showed
him
into
the
brig
cabin
and
then
a
door
opened
and
doris
threw
herself
weeping
into
his
arms
oh
doris
he
whispered
why
did
you
not
tell
me
you
were
ill
i
would
have
come
to
you
long
ago
i
feel
a
brute
she
placed
her
hand
on
his
lips
never
mind
about
me
fred
has
captain
latham
told
you
about
yes
he
replied
and
then
suddenly
doris
i
am
going
to
look
for
her
i
think
i
know
the
place
to
which
she
has
gone
it
is
not
far
from
here
doris
will
you
go
on
back
to
vahitahi
with
latham
and
wait
for
me
fred
she
whispered
let
me
come
with
you
it
will
not
be
long
dear
before
i
am
gone
and
it
was
hard
to
die
away
from
you
that
is
why
i
came
and
perhaps
we
may
find
her
he
kissed
her
silently
and
then
in
five
minutes
more
they
had
said
farewell
to
latham
and
were
on
their
way
to
the
schooner
the
crew
soon
knew
from
him
what
had
happened
and
rua
manu
with
his
big
eyes
filled
with
a
wondering
pity
as
he
looked
at
the
frail
body
and
white
face
of
doris
lying
on
the
skylight
wore
the
schooner
head
round
to
the
at
a
sign
from
brantley
aye
paranili
he
said
in
his
deep
guttural
tones
it
is
to
tatakoto
she
hath
gone
is
her
mother
land
that
night
as
she
lay
on
the
skylight
with
her
hand
in
his
doris
told
him
all
she
knew
they
were
all
kind
to
me
when
i
went
ashore
to
your
house
fred
but
luita
looked
so
fiercely
at
me
her
eyes
frightened
me
they
had
a
look
of
death
in
them
in
the
morning
your
little
child
was
taken
ill
with
what
they
call
tataru
and
i
wanted
to
give
it
medicine
luita
pushed
my
hand
away
and
hugged
the
child
to
her
bosom
and
then
the
other
women
came
and
made
signs
for
me
to
go
away
and
that
night
she
and
the
child
were
missing
and
one
of
your
boats
was
gone
poor
luita
said
brantley
stroking
doris
pale
cheek
she
did
not
know
you
were
my
sister
i
never
told
her
doris
she
is
a
very
beautiful
woman
fred
they
told
me
at
tahiti
that
she
was
called
the
pearl
of
vahitahi
and
oh
my
dear
if
we
can
but
find
her
i
will
make
her
love
me
for
your
sake
late
in
the
afternoon
of
the
second
day
just
as
the
trade
wind
began
to
lose
its
strength
the
schooner
was
running
along
the
of
tatakoto
and
rua
manu
from
the
called
out
that
he
saw
the
boat
lying
on
the
beach
inside
the
lagoon
with
her
sail
set
and
as
landing
was
not
practicable
on
the
the
schooner
ran
round
to
the
lee
we
will
soon
know
doris
it
always
rains
in
these
islands
at
this
time
of
the
year
so
she
would
not
suffer
as
i
once
did
but
the
sail
of
the
boat
is
still
set
and
that
makes
me
think
she
has
never
left
it
wait
till
i
come
back
again
doris
you
can
not
help
me
and
doris
throwing
her
weak
arms
round
his
neck
kissed
him
with
a
sob
and
lay
back
again
to
wait
with
rua
manu
and
two
others
of
his
faithful
native
crew
brantley
walked
quickly
across
the
island
to
the
lagoon
to
where
the
boat
lay
luita
was
not
there
and
the
dark
eyes
of
his
sailors
met
his
in
a
responsive
glow
of
hope
she
had
not
died
in
the
boat
they
turned
back
into
the
silent
aisles
of
coconut
palms
and
then
rua
manu
loudly
called
her
name
listen
he
said
a
voice
a
weak
trembling
voice
was
singing
the
song
of
talaloo
terunavahori
bending
low
bindeth
the
sandals
on
talaloo
feet
o
hasten
lover
true
the
coral
cruel
and
sharp
over
the
coral
and
sand
and
rock
snare
thee
a
turtle
for
our
marriage
feast
ia
akoe
brave
lover
mine
in
the
old
marae
paranili
said
rua
manu
pointing
to
the
remains
of
a
ruined
temple
motioning
to
the
seamen
to
remain
outside
brantley
entered
the
crumbling
walls
of
the
old
heathen
marae
at
the
far
end
was
a
little
screen
of
coconut
boughs
he
stooped
down
and
went
in
a
few
minutes
passed
and
then
his
hand
was
thrust
out
between
the
branches
as
a
sign
for
them
to
follow
one
by
one
they
came
and
sat
beside
brantley
who
held
the
wasted
figure
of
the
wanderer
in
his
arms
the
sound
of
his
voice
had
brought
back
her
wavering
reason
and
she
knew
them
all
now
she
knew
too
that
her
brief
young
life
was
ebbing
fast
for
as
each
of
the
brown
men
pressed
their
lips
to
her
hand
tears
coursed
down
their
cheeks
see
men
of
vahitahi
my
englishman
hath
come
to
me
a
fool
that
fled
from
his
house
because
i
thought
that
he
lied
to
me
teloma
was
it
who
first
mocked
and
said
his
wife
from
beretania
who
hath
come
to
seek
him
and
then
other
girls
laughed
and
mocked
also
and
said
luita
this
girl
who
sayeth
she
is
thy
husband
sister
and
their
words
and
looks
stung
me
so
at
night
i
took
my
child
and
swam
to
the
boat
my
child
see
it
is
here
and
she
touched
a
little
mound
in
the
soil
beside
her
there
was
a
low
murmur
of
sympathy
and
then
the
brown
men
went
outside
and
covered
their
faces
with
their
hands
after
the
manner
of
their
race
when
death
is
near
and
waited
in
silence
night
had
fallen
on
the
lonely
island
and
the
muffled
boom
of
the
breakers
as
they
dashed
on
the
black
ledges
of
the
weather
reef
would
now
and
then
be
borne
into
the
darkness
of
the
little
hut
put
thy
face
to
mine
paranili
she
whispered
i
grow
cold
now
as
the
bearded
face
of
the
man
bent
over
her
one
thin
weak
arm
rose
waveringly
in
the
air
and
then
fell
softly
round
his
neck
and
brantley
with
his
hand
upon
her
bosom
felt
that
her
heart
had
ceased
to
beat
the
next
day
he
sailed
the
schooner
into
the
lagoon
and
doris
pressed
her
lips
on
the
dead
forehead
of
the
native
girl
ere
she
was
laid
to
rest
something
that
doris
had
said
to
him
as
they
walked
away
from
her
grave
filled
brantley
heart
with
a
deadly
fear
and
as
he
took
her
in
his
arms
his
voice
shook
do
say
that
doris
it
can
not
be
so
soon
as
that
i
was
never
a
good
man
but
surely
god
will
spare
you
to
me
a
little
longer
but
it
came
very
soon
on
the
morning
of
the
day
that
he
intended
sailing
out
of
the
lagoon
again
doris
died
in
his
arms
on
board
the
schooner
and
brantley
laid
her
to
rest
under
the
shade
of
a
giant
that
overshadowed
the
stones
of
the
old
marae
that
night
he
called
rua
manu
into
the
cabin
and
asked
him
if
he
could
beat
his
way
back
to
vahitahi
in
the
schooner
is
an
easy
matter
paranili
so
that
the
sky
be
clear
and
i
can
see
the
stars
then
shall
i
find
vahitahi
in
three
days
good
then
take
the
schooner
there
and
tell
such
of
the
people
as
desire
to
be
with
me
to
come
here
and
bring
with
them
all
things
that
are
in
my
house
it
is
my
mind
to
live
here
at
tatakoto
as
the
schooner
slipped
through
the
narrow
passage
he
stood
on
the
low
sandy
point
and
waved
his
hand
in
farewell
a
week
later
the
little
vessel
dropped
her
anchor
in
the
lagoon
again
and
rua
manu
and
his
crew
came
ashore
to
seek
him
they
found
him
lying
under
the
shade
of
the
with
his
revolver
in
his
hand
and
a
in
his
temple
